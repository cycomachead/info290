4
not
impressed
the
concept
of
a
belgium
ipa
seems
makeshift
at
best
and
imho
tend
to
combine
to
a
drink
that
is
less
than
either
style
alone
this
has
the
ipa
bitterness
and
sometime
oiliness
which
is
at
odds
with
the
yeast
phenolics
producing
a
mishmash
of
clashing
flavors
o
theres
a
great
balance
of
flavors
here
with
malt
hops
yeast
and
alcohol
all
contributing
vibrant
and
juicy
tropical
notes
brought
by
both
big
esters
and
hops
provide
the
focal
point
spicy
and
peppery
yeast
and
alcohol
add
a
lot
of
depth
and
complexity
it
ends
up
being
more
of
a
sipper
with
the
big
alcohol
warmth
slowing
things
down
but
this
one
is
both
fun
and
contemplative
at
the
same
time
o
not
an
easy
beer
to
like
not
complex
leaves
a
bitter
taste
o
a
very
good
beer
but
i
would
like
more
late
addition
hops
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
reach
for
a
second
one
definitely
worth
trying
would
buy
again
at
the
right
price
overall
this
beer
definitely
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
i
feel
a
road
trip
to
chambly
coming
up
in
the
near
future
o
excellent
beer
would
like
it
a
few
shades
cooler
as
i
had
it
at
room
temperature
complex
and
unique
more
floral
than
others
in
this
style
i
remember
and
slightly
sweeter
this
was
just
fine
but
didnt
really
stand
out
in
the
style
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
and
definitely
packs
a
punch
of
yeast
to
all
senses
oit
as
a
good
beer
overall
it
was
pretty
solid
but
it
wasnt
really
as
outstanding
as
some

other

sort

with
the
strawberry

remaining
most
salient
to
me
moderate
of

carbonation
with
a
green

and
doughy

finish
not
parching
and
boozy
like

notably
hoppy

not

wonderful

really
so
much
going

enjoy
overall
a
very
nice

begianipa
mix
overall
a
very
good
belgian
ipa
one
of
my
favorites
and
probably
one
of
the
most
sessionable
ones
if
a
belgian
ipa
can
ever
be
called
that
could
easily
drink
the
4
pack
over
the
course
of
an
evening
without
thinking
twice
o
much
more
hoppy
than
what
i
was
expecting
and
more
west
coast
in
style
quite
well
done
i
rather
enjoyed
the
ale
but
not
as
the
usually
constructed
belgian
ipa
its
heavy
british
overtones
gives
the
ale
a
unique
identity
thats
quite
left
of

pours

with
a
foamy

that
settles

on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
and
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is

steely

and
dry
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
the
taste
departs
from
the
smell
by
having
a
far
greater
level
of
hop
flavor
theres
nearly
no
yeast
bite
which
is
surprising
given
that
this
was
dominant
in
the
nose
reasonable
pale
malt
base
for
the
style
the
body
leans
on
the
rich
side
and
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
overall
its
a
smooth
ipa
with
very
mild
belgian
tendencies
interesting
belgian
ipa
not
my
preferred
style
but
there
are
very
few
true
belgians
that
could
compete
with
this
one
othe
bottle
date
seemed
to
imply
it
was
about
a
month
old
but
maybe
with
the
canadian
ddmm
system
it
was
actually
bottled
over
six
months
ago
i
sure
hope
so
but
ill
still
look
out
for
it
again
if
i
know
it
is
fresh
o
a
powerful
tart
belgian
ale
definitely
not
a
belgian
ipa
more
like
a
belgian
tripel
didnt
hit
the
spot
with
e
but
certainly
will
for
others
zealous
biting
carbonation
plays
with
the
tongue
but
like
a
child
soon
grows
bored
and
gives
it
a
rest
moderate
to
light
in
body
well
balanced
and
satisfying
however
there
is
little
hop
presence
for
an
ipa
belgian
or
not
in
both
flavor
and
aroma
to
me
this
drinks
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
would
certainly
drink
again
i
really
like
the
rich
flavor
of
floral
and
citrus
with
a
strong
pronounced
yeast
character
this
style
is
a
favourite
of
mine
and
this
is
a
pretty
solid
example
of
some
of
the
best
aspects
it
is
lighter
on
hops
than
american
ipas
but
does
has
a
realy
nice
citrus
bite
to
it
lots
of
complexity
and
a
good
balance
of
aromatic
citrusy
hops
with
a
really
solid
yeast
profile
will
be
looking
for
this

the

nothing

there
was
an
ingredient
i
could

taste
is

it
could
be
that
i
had
higher
expectations
o
really
solid
im
not

how
fresh
my
bottle
was

there
was
almost
no

which
is
not

bad
thing
the
sweet
harmonizes
nicely
with
the
yeast

spices
this
is

provides

at

feeling

thumbs
up
o
very
drinkable
its
not
at
all
a
belgian
ipa
but
a
belgian
strong
ale
great
beer
which
is
no
surprise
considering
the
brewery
overall
its
another
wannabe
belgium
from
canada
just
like
the
unibroue
line
up
still
decent
but
more
rich
and
sweet
than
i
prefer
also
the
american
wannabe
belgiums
are
catching
up
and
putting
our
some
really
good
brews
so
the
canadian
wannabes
have
some
competition
but
overall
its
a
decent
product
just
not
my
favorite
and
i
prefer
the
real
belgiums
just
when
i
start
thinking
that
i
might
enjoy
belgian
ipas
this
pops
up
and
i
have
to
take
a
step
back
it
wasnt
bad
per
se
but
it
didnt
have
what
i
was
hoping
for
a
great
complex
belgian
pale
but
i
kind
of
struggle
to
find
the
i
part
of
that
belgian
base
is
a
bit
too
bold
for
the
hops
funny
that
still
a

only
complaint
is
the
price
of
this
beer
fluffy

cap
and
leaves
nice
lace
in

but
it
comes
across
a
bit
too
tart
and
with
more
wheat
flavor
than
i
need
in
a

a
good
and
had
a
dry

aftertaste
overall
this
was
not
very
unique
but
had
a
nice
clean
and
crisp
taste
the
flavor
was
fairly
well

was
all
i
can
handle

then
some

really

would

had
it

the

a

does

more

its
seems

the

is
off
leaves
a

like

andor

on
the

its

appears
to
be
a

beer
to
me
excellent
o
if
i
wasnt
told
this
was
belgian
ipa
i
think
i
would
just
think
it
was
a
wit
the
bitterness
is
subtle
but
overall
its
a
nice
beer
this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
tasty
to
boot
there
are
more
dramatic
belgian
ipas
out
there
but
this
one
packs
some
good
flavor
in
a
fairly
low
abv
package
o
a
wonderfully
refreshing
and
flavorful
belgian
style
ipa
i
am
personally
very
fond
of
these
belgian
or
white
ipas
this
particular
one
marries
the
unique
spiciness
and
characterful
yeast
typical
of
belgian
beers
with
the
aggressiveness
of
american
hops
really
effectively
this
would
have
gotten
a
considerably
higher
rating
if
not
for
the
appearance
but
as

stated
that
will
come
done

an

a

for
the

would
not

very
often
hazy

lightly
funky

the
flavor
profile
has
more

than
hops
even
on

the
hoppiness
becomes
more
assertive
halfway
through
the
glass
but
a
sweet
note
remains
throughout
overall
not
a
bad
grew
at
all
but
factoring
in
the
price
and
availability
it
has
major
holes
in
it
hate
to
sound
like
this
but
it
could
use
some
tweaking
worth
just
to
split
it
with
a
friend
or
maybe
like
i
did
and
watch
some
reruns

not

the

this

with
the

for
the

despite
the

i

a
healthy
dose
of
cantaloupe
and
butterscotch
with
some
pine
needles
to
complement
the
clovelike
medicinal
burn
it
is
indeed
bitter
but
the
butterscotch
and
fruit
elements
really
dial
this
aspect
down
for
me
the
complexity
on
the
nose
does
not
quite
translate
perfectly
onto
the
palate
but
im
not
really
complaining
some
alcohol
detectable
on

body
on
the
high
end

medium
with
mellow
gentle
carbonation
quite
a
nice
brew
that
i
would
seek
out
again
my
impression
does
not
jive
that
well
with
the
written
impressions
of
the
masters
like
micheal
jackson
who
emphasize
the
bitterness

well

it
the

if
youre
a

belgian
beer
fan
youd
be
remiss
in
passing
up
the
opportunity
to
grab
a
few
bottles
while
its
available
locally
o
not
as
hoppy
as
say
chouffes
version
but
reminiscent
of
hopus
and
this
one
is
supposedly
the
first
belgian
ipa
ever
glad
to
have
found
a
bottle
in
chiang

enjoy
o
overall
great
beer
will
buy
more
soon
caught
myself
gulping
this
down
rather
quickly
i
had
two
so
i
tried
to
take
the
time
to
really
sit
with
the
next
one
but
it
was
hard
great
beer
overall
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
in
myself
i
actually
really
appreciate
this
beer
and
like
it
above
the
other
urthel
beers
i
have
had
in
the
past
it
makes
me
want
to
revisit
the
others
sometime
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
springtime
would
be
a
perfect
time
for
this
one
rjt
a
hope
forward
belgian
blond
with
some
character
not
sure
why
this
beer
and
their
others
for
that
matter
sits
on
shelves
the
way
it
does
mostly
clear
bright
golden
color
with
a
fading
inch
of
white
lace
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
yeast
chunks
settling
out
a
nose
of
strong
alcohol
belgian
yeast
and
bittering
hops
with
a
nice
floral
component
and
a
grassy
malt
lightness
its
a
crisp
drinker
a
little
sweet
like
a
good
tripel
but
cleaned
up
well
by
the
yeast
and
hop
balance
towards
the
finish
more
carbonation
would
help
this
although
its
far
from
flat
a
well
built
brew
with
a
nice
yeast
complexion
and
a
little
more
going
on
than
the
standard
belgian
strong
pale
ale
solid
brew
overall
but
maybe
a
new
marketing
or
branding
strategy
is
needed
overall
a
good
quality
belgian
ipa
a
good
combination
of
hops
yeast
earth
and
malts
it
still
isnt
worth
au150
a
case
of
24
x

but
ill
take
one
every
now
and
then
slightly
bitter
to
start
before
going
sweet
in
a
big
way
and
then
finishing
dry
and
bitter
bready
and
hoppy
a
touch
of
orange
peel
interesting
but
overall
too
sweet
in
character
overall
i
like
it
fine
ill
try
another
bottle
fresher
to
check
it
out
with
more
hop
character
more
aroma
and
a
tad
more
bite
on
the
palate
and
this
would
probably
be
a
really
outstanding
beer
overall
a
really
interesting
brew
love
the
seamless
transition
of
flavors
and
stages
massively
complex
while
being
very
drinkable
at
the
same
time

the
body
was
medium
typical
for
an
ipa
but
heavy
for
a
blond
which
is
what
the
label
calls
the
beer
drinkability
was
ok
but
the
alcohol

was
a
negative
in

with
some
yeast
citrus
fruits
and
a
grassy
or
straw
scent
this
is
tangy
tasting
with
a
citrus
zing
some
yeast
and
spicy
hops
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
with
a
full
enough
mouthfeel
theres
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
considering
its
9
5
id
call
it
very
mild
i
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
tmd
again
a
nice
cross
of
a
triple
and
an
ipa
hoppy
for
sure
but
lacking
in
the
sweetness
found
in
either
style
at
times
alcohol
is
very
apparent
it
doesnt
taste
bad
at
all
but
i
find
it
quite
dense
and
difficult
to
sip
even
for
urthel
i
love
their
samaranth
quad
a
beautifull
looking
brew
pours
a
glowing
golden
with
a
thick
lacy
white
head
the
nose
is
a
perfect
blend
between
a
belgian
triple
and
an
american
double
ipa
rich
malts
tropical
fruits
carmelized
candy
spicy
yeasts
with
a
big
bouquet
of
hops
the
taste
is
more
on
the
ipa
side
but
still
quite
good
fresh
floral
hops
over
delicate
malts
and
ripe
fruit
with
subtle
alcohol
and
herbal
yeasts
really
opens
up
at
room
temp
nice
full
body
yet
crisp
and
refreshing
a
delicious
ale
from
urthel
poured
pale
yellow
no
head
tastes
chalky
smells
like
it
would
have
some
citrus
but
almost
none
in
the
flavor
just
allaround
unplesant
i
have
no
idea
what
they
were
going
for
here
for
what
it
is
more
carbonation
is
definitely
required
im
glad
i
finally
tried
this
one
quite
easy
to
drink
for
a
bigger
beer
good
stuff
edit
based
on
others
reviews
i
really
think
our
bottle
was
not
properly
carbonated
for
some
reason
drinkability
is
really
high
considering
the
abv
its
a
great
warm
weather
sipper
serving
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazed
yellow
thin
white
head
forms
and
settles
to
a
thin
ring
drops
some
lace
spots
looks
okay
smell
is
sweet
and
honeylike
grassy
some
sherry
citrus
and
floral
hops
wheat
yeast
and
spices
not
as
hoppy
as
i
had
hoped
taste
is
honey
spicy
floral
hoppy
middle
with
some
decent
citrus
sherry
alcohol
bit
of
tart
fruit
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
maybe
an
older
bottle
not
bad
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
out
of
it
thanks
jan
d
great
beer
ill
have
again
mouth
feel
is
silky
and
smooth
just
cant
drink
10
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
id
like
to
try
pours
a
very
beautiful
hazed
blond
pale
with
an
average
head
that
quickly
falls
to
splotchy
islands
of
film
across
the
top
smell
is
very
nice
ripe
pear
tart
green
apple
green
grapes
hints
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
a
floral
citrus
aroma
that
slides
through
softly
taste
very
nice
green
apple
and
pear
play
nicely
with
the
belgian
yeasts
funky
earthy
flavor
and
all
are
visited
by
a
peppery
pine
apple
and
citrus
note
nothing
is
overbearing
and
the
champagne
like
mouthfeel
helps
dry
the
finish
and
keeps
me
going
back
for
more
the
scary
part
is
the
9
5
abv
that
number
alone
would
tell
someone
that
this
is
a
sipper
however
this
beer
can
be
drank
by
the
mouthful
without
a
second
thought
just
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
evaporating
from
the
back
of
my
tonsils
after
a
sip
reminds
me
to
take
it
easy
quite
the
tasty
quaffer
for
sure
bought
after
the
beer
meeting
96
later
golden
big
fluffy
head
lacing
grade
a
bitter
sweet
flavourful
beehive
delicious
like
a
hoppppy
tripppel
abv
is
well
hidden
does
the
dutch
proud
i
wouldnt
leave
the
bar
if
i
could
find
this
on
tap
just
an
enjoyable
brew
but
the
hophead
in
me
says
more
hops
not
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
i
get
a
little
chalky
dryness
to
the
palate
from
this
brew
nothing
that
will
stop
me
from
drinking
it
but
not
my
favorite
feeling
on
a
side
note
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
almost
10
abv
a
great
first
beer
for
a
night
of
moderate
drinking
this
one
deserves
a
fresh
palate
to
really
enjoy
it
overall
it
is
decent
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
since
this
beer
has
been
highly
rated
by
others
i
would
probably
seek
it
out
again
to
try
a
bottle
and
see
the
difference
at
least
this
glass
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
belgium
does
double
ipa
in
this
interesting
take
that
we
had
on
draft
appearance
was
surprisingly
clear
compared
to
most
intense
beers
one
comes
across
modest
frothy
head
which
leaves
a
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
over
time
there
is
a
cross
between
the
piney
citrus
of
the
ipa
with
the
phenolic
fruitiness
of
the
typical
belgian
strong
pale
ale
d
no
thanks
i
dont
like
tripels
to
begin
with
very
much
and
this
isnt
much
more
than
a
somewhat
hoppy
tripel
i
understand
if
thats
what
the
idea
is
behind
a
belgian
ipa
but
it
isnt
something
id
have
another
of
maybe
not
even
something
id
buy
again
had
on
draft
at
zenos
in
state
college
this
was
the
first
beer
i
had
there
light
golden
color
ok
head
great
lacing
however
strong
malty
smell
not
much
of
a
hop
nose
taste
was
good
but
not
near
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
expected
for
a
belgium
hoppy
beer
this
is
a
nicely
done
belgian
ipa
it
suffers
a
tiny
bit
from
the
astringency
from
the
alcohol
but
its
not
too
bad
give
it
a
try
theres
a
bitter
aftertaste
i
am
not
used
to
associating
with
belgianbrewed
beers
there
was
an
oxidized
offnote
when
the
beer
was
first
served
but
it
gradually
disappeared
after
some
warming
d
definitely
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
the
entire
bottle
and
look
forward
to
having
again
first
pour
off
the
bottle
is
quite
clear
but
going
back
to
the
bottle
i
can
see
all
kinds
of
shit
floating
around
color
is
a
gorgeous
light
gold
color
with
plumes
of
silky
white
head
really
a
beautiful
beer
before
all
that
hopyeast
crap
gets
in
there
aromas
are
full
of
tripel
like
esters
light
clove
and
citrus
a
little
funk
and
a
blanket
of
noble
hop
notes
floral
and
spicy
it
basically
smells
like
a
hopped
up
duvel
on
the
palate
the
belgian
blonde
flavors
really
dominate
and
it
finishes
with
a
dose
of
hallertaulike
hop
flavor
and
a
firm
bitterness
but
nothing
in
the
realm
of
aipas
carbonation
is
medium
high
and
with
a
moderate
body
this
is
the
first
bipa
ive
had
and
i
have
to
say
its
really
a
creative
style
fusing
two
other
styles
i
really
like
and
doing
it
well
ill
have
to
seek
out
some
other
versions
this
tastes
exactly
what
it
is
an
tripel
mixed
with
an
ipa
a
very
unusual
combo
that
works
fairly
well
looking
forward
to
drink
this
again
poured
a
real
medium
golden
with
white
head
the
hops
were
apparent
from
the
pour
the
taste
was
great
super
hoppy
yet
medium
to
light
feel
all
the
way
down
this
one
was
especially
carbonated
which
added
to
its
distinct
feel
this
one
was
definitely
enjoyable
and
i
hope
to
find
it
again
d
fairly
easy
drinking
works
well
on
a
hot
evening
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
but
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
d
the
bitterness
really
takes
this
one
down
a
notch
for
me
ill
stick
with
the
la
chouffe
d
mine
came
from
a
12oz
bottle
not
the
bomber
shown
in
the
description
i
would
get
this
again
for
some
possible
aging
and
tastings
t
very
nice
hop
flavor
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
a
terrific
mouthfeel
this
is
an
ideal
ale
for
the
deck
on
a
warm
evening
would
be
very
good
with
steamed
mussels
an
incredibly
tart
wellbalanced
ipa
that
has
enough
malt
to
bring
to
the
party
and
only
enough
hops
to
make
a
point
this
beer
puts
many
triples
and
goldens
to
shame
updated
5
minutes
later
im
getting
over
the
carbonation
the
taste
seemes
to
be
improving
as
it
warms
taste
and
drinkability
get
0
5
while
this
isnt
my
first
experience
with
belgian
ipas
this
is
my
first
experience
with
urthel
and
drinking
a
belgian
ipa
not
on
tap
poured
a
33cl
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
the
beer
is
beautiful
it
pours
a
hazy
yellowishorange
with
a
huge
white
frothy
head
that
leaves
extremely
sticky
lacing
down
the
entirety
of
the
glass
wow
this
sets
the
standard
for
the
style
in
my
mind
the
aroma
is
citrus
up
front
with
orange
and
lemon
peel
coming
out
there
is
also
a
slight
hint
of
breadiness
that
finishes
with
just
a
bit
of
spice
from
the
yeast
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
the
spiciness
comes
out
and
reminds
me
of
pepper
on
my
tongue
a
slight
alcohol
comes
out
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
a
dipa
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
full
thick
and
it
coats
your
mouth
with
a
mild
bitterness
the
spiciness
kind
of
overpowers
the
hops
a
bit
but
its
a
very
good
ipa
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
i
think
that
this
obviously
pretty
old
bottle
has
definately
mellowed
out
the
hops
a
little
bit
too
much
but
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
aged
to
a
very
nice
smoothe
blend
of
flavors
i
kind
of
prefer
a
relatively
fresh
bottle
of
this
outstanding
belgian
ipa
i
like
it
alot
would
buy
again
drinkability
depends
on
your
threshold
for
belgian
ales
this
beer
at
9
5
is
a
slow
sipper
though
still
i
think
its
an
interesting
style
that
ive
never
experienced
much
would
i
buy
it
again
maybe
and
just
for
the
purpose
of
aging
it
went
down
quite
easily
first
few
ounces
were
colder
and
much
less
enjoyable
than
the
rest
as
it
warmed
by
the
end
of
the
750
it
was
drinkin
like
a
session
beer
d
id
really
like
to
have
the
other
half
of
this
bottle
back
but
im
a
nice
guy
and
shared
it
with
the
better
half
this
takes
the
best
of
a
belgian
tripel
and
a
continental
ipa
and
blends
them
nicely
this
is
a
good
easy
to
drink
beer
but
not
one
id
order
regularly
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
but
ill
stick
to
the
more
traditional
belgian
ales
a
hard
pour
reveals
a
creamy
golden
brew
which
is
topped
by
a
huge
offwhite
head
retention
and
lacing
are
excellent
and
are
almost
too
much
for
the
tulip
to
handle
smells
fuity
estery
and
creamy
up
front
with
a
little
hoppy
covering
overlaying
some
sweet
bready
malts
not
as
hoppy
tasting
as
expected
but
a
slight
bitterness
does
offset
the
malty
goodness
sour
fruits
make
for
a
slightly
tangy
and
a
bit
of
a
winy
experience
carbonation
is
active
and
really
opens
things
up
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
more
characteristic
of
a
tripel
but
damn
good
this
is
what
i
would
call
a
hybrid
ipatripel
if
you
can
get
beyond
the
categories
this
is
one
sweet
tasting
brew
incorrectly
listed
here
as
a
product
of
belgium
mine
clearly
says
on
the
label
its
from
the
netherlands
d
good
complexity
of
flavors
sour
lemons
oranges
spicy
hops
making
for
a
interesting
drink
d
quite
drinkable
and
very
full
of
flavor
the
hop
character
is
profound
and
refined
much
like
sam
adams
imperial
pilsner
with
a
fruity
peppery
yeast
essence
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
great
triple
overall
a
distinctly
excellent
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
drinkability
is
moderate
a
wellbalanced
ipa
that
is
a
little
light
on
the
the
hop
presence
and
bordering
on
cloying
sweetness
the
belgian
aspect
is
a
unique
twist
on
the
style
overall
a
solid
but
unremarkable
beer
serving
type
bottle
dangerously
drinkable
seems
to
be
quite
different
from
the
majority
of
other
belgian
ipas
due
to
the
emphasis
on
sweet
malt
character
dvery
enjoyable
a
complex
nuanced
brew
that
continues
to
deliver
as
the
temperature
rises
a
really
unique
beer
worth
trying
if
you
enjoy
american
ipas
you
may
or
may
not
enjoy
the
belgian
versions
in
my
opinion
they
are
pretty
different
beers
american
hops
are
just
a
different
animal
i
enjoyed
it
more
for
its
belgian
qualities
and
its
unique
flavors
if
i
ever
find
it
for
2
50
as
i
recently
did
i
will
certainly
buy
more
than
one
this
is
almost
very
good
its
a
bold
beer
but
really
neither
the
malt
nor
the
hops
take
charge
flavorwise
and
it
appears
a
bit
mild
even
though
it
absolutely
is
not
it
seems
to
beg
for
a
defining
characteristic
other
comments
this
is
a
great
beer
but
i
was
surprised
at
how
nothoppy
it
is
in
other
words
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
of
a
kick
having
said
that
this
is
a
much
more
balanced
brew
than
what
you
typically
get
from
an
american
craft
brewery
d
the
taste
was
just
too
disappointing
to
try
again
initially
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
huge
tight
white
head
thats
kept
alive
by
a
whirling
effervescence
monster
lacing
effects
some
3d
that
fade
like
an
ice
cream
float
many
tiny
itsybitsy
suspended
particles
reveal
themselves
as
you
venture
downward
further
and
further
really
quite
a
show
the
smell
has
a
nice
bright
crisp
lemon
fruity
character
that
dominates
the
earthy
yeast
notes
below
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
refreshing
and
light
more
or
less
a
hoppy
tripel
or
in
other
words
a
tripel
with
attitude
scores
serious
points
for
passion
and
imagination
full
flavored
the
taste
is
bright
with
a
fruity
citrus
note
moderately
spicy
and
full
of
hops
finishes
on
the
dry
side
with
a
unique
and
complex
fruity
yeasty
after
taste
that
lingers
nicely
the
9
5
abv
is
well
hidden
best
when
considered
in
an
off
centered
alternate
to
the
best
pint
glass
and
in
the
comfort
of
a
poofy
recliner
a
lot
going
on
with
this
one
quite
a
hoot
super
glad
that
the
folks
at
sam
the
beer
man
get
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
smooth
this
reminds
me
somewhat
of
duvel
but
more
strong
flavors
very
good
drink
way
too
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
hopit
was
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
this
is
really
quite
a
solid
beer
was
expecting
more
hops
from
the
name
but
its
nice
to
be
surprised
if
you
like
belgian
golden
ales
or
tripels
you
will
probably
find
this
worth
the
10
an
interesting
offering
from
a
belgian
brewery
definitely
worth
a
try
cheers
d
i
am
glad
to
say
i
tried
it
but
after
reading
the
back
of
the
bottle
about
how
the
brewer
visited
the
pacific
northwest
and
was
inspired
by
the
ipas
to
make
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
else
from
a
1pint
9
fl
oz
bottle
copped
caged
and
corked
from
wine
and
beverage
depot
in
totowa
this
superior
belgian
ipa
is
right
up
there
with
chouffe
dobbelen
ipa
as
one
of
the
best
renditions
of
this
remarkable
style
although
a
bit
pricey
this
belgian
was
worth
every
penny
impressive
frothy
and
foamy
head
lays
atop
a
cloudy
hazy
strawcolored
appearance
with
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
smell
is
complete
with
light
fresh
hops
citrus
and
lemons
bubblegum
flavor
with
fresh
pines
hops
fruit
and
perhaps
a
bitter
of
coriander
and
spices
with
a
honey
and
cream
taste
exquisite
topnotch
taste
i
could
drink
this
all
night
mouthfeel
was
like
butter
light
fullofflavor
rich
with
a
nice
sprucy
bubbly
feel
overall
easy
drinkability
and
the
9
5
abv
is
only
slightly
noticeable
behind
a
wonderful
cornucopia
of
rich
satisfying
flavors
hands
down
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
ever
sampled
great
stuff
looking
forward
to
sampling
other
beers
from
this
terrific
brewery
definitely
recommended
also
the
glass
that
i
had
was
a
little
expensive
the
bar
manager
said
that
its
almost
6
times
the
usual
cost
for
a
keg
i
stopped
complaining
d
extremely
complex
brew
for
sure
very
impressed
lots
of
flavors
and
textures
coming
out
in
this
brew
all
of
the
flavors
blend
quite
well
together
could
perhaps
use
a
bit
more
of
a
malt
backbone
but
otherwise
a
truly
unique
concoction
fantastic
dvery
unique
beervery
drinkable
even
at
9
5
harder
too
find
but
was
worth
it
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
orange
highlights
the
head
is
a
decent
tight
white
head
that
left
some
real
nice
lacing
on
my
chimay
glass
the
taste
is
typical
belgian
some
nice
barn
yard
funk
like
a
saison
some
nice
belgian
candi
sugar
like
a
bspa
it
also
has
a
tart
apple
aroma
the
taste
starts
off
with
palt
malt
and
candi
sugar
which
is
quickly
followed
by
a
wave
of
corriander
there
is
a
light
light
bitter
hop
also
there
is
a
noticable
fusel
alcohol
flavor
the
feel
is
moderate
and
quite
fizzy
the
finish
is
on
the
sweeter
side
definitely
a
very
nice
golden
belgian
brew
the
hops
really
arent
there
not
sure
if
this
brew
needs
a
9
5
abv
which
definitely
limits
the
drinkability
would
like
to
try
a
side
by
side
with
piraat
definitely
worth
a
try
for
the
curious
beer
drinker
like
kosmoraios
below
my
bottle
has
a
new
label
although
it
still
says
the
original
hopit
with
so
many
stellar
reviews
i
wonder
if
the
recipe
has
changed
a
bit
r
i
p
de
garre
snifter
the
best
beer
glass
i
have
ever
had
passed
fell
on
the
floor
not
long
after
the
initial
108
review
mouthfeel
is
overcarbonated
and
oily
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
due
to
its
high
and
poorlymasked
alcohol
content
it
tastes
like
a
unibroue
beer
nice
try
urthel
not
horrible
but
time
for
a
revamp
ive
been
waiting
awhile
to
take
this
11
49
1pt
9oz
bottle
out
of
the
fridge
i
finally
decided
to
try
it
what
could
be
better
a
hoppy
ipa
with
a
belgian
touch
two
of
my
favorite
styles
on
the
table
i
took
it
out
from
a
42deg
fridge
let
it
set
in
room
temp
for
30
min
and
popped
the
cork
thats
where
my
excitement
started
to
dwindle
poured
a
hazy
butterscotch
color
with
a
ridicules
amount
of
tiny
white
bubble
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
a
good
head
but
this
was
quite
the
over
load
i
literally
had
6
inches
of
tight
ice
cream
like
head
for
every
1oz
of
beer
i
poured
i
had
to
wait
5
minutes
for
the
ball
of
foam
to
produce
a
mouthful
of
liquid
smells
much
more
of
a
banana
cream
triple
belgian
ale
concoxion
than
an
ipa
i
dont
like
the
way
the
beer
is
balanced
between
the
creamy
sweetness
and
the
hoppy
bitterness
dont
expect
much
from
the
ipa
aspect
definitely
a
let
down
in
my
book
pours
a
hazed
gold
with
very
little
head
that
falls
quickly
to
nothing
massive
amount
of
lacing
at
first
nose
is
an
evident
alcohol
and
aged
cheese
skins
yeah
that
is
what
i
said
flavor
is
thick
on
hops
but
the
sugars
seem
to
cut
into
it
quite
a
bit
and
provide
a
really
odd
marriage
seems
to
be
an
interesting
mix
of
spices
in
there
as
well
that
provide
an
interesting
accent
feel
is
thicker
on
the
liquid
with
a
fairly
high
amount
of
carbonation
over
the
tongue
very
drinkable
an
interesting
brew
with
a
mix
of
things
going
on
worth
trying
for
sure
hazy
golden
with
a
rocky
white
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
decent
lace
nose
is
georgeous
nice
soft
lemony
citrusy
and
slightly
fruitybubblegummy
hop
character
really
hoppy
yeasty
as
well
and
also
a
hint
of
a
pale
malt
and
begian
sweet
backbone
taste
is
the
same
a
really
satisfying
belgian
style
hop
bomb
with
a
nice
soft
mediumfull
body
a
good
belgian
always
seems
lighter
to
me
than
it
actually
is
because
the
way
they
are
carbonated
but
this
one
is
light
and
heavy
at
the
same
time
if
that
makes
sense
creamy
and
silky
yet
light
and
lively
a
real
pleasure
and
very
food
friendly
d
this
beer
though
does
not
get
lost
in
the
wash
as
it
has
its
own
very
nice
and
unique
qualities
a
very
solid
offering
and
a
top
five
belgian
ipa
to
be
sure
i
have
been
trying
to
make
my
way
through
the
belgian
ipas
and
have
always
been
a
bigger
fan
of
the
american
style
lower
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
and
was
really
impressed
by
the
take
on
the
style
top
notch
belgian
ipa
huh
interesting
very
excited
to
give
it
a
shot
poured
into
oversized
wine
glass
it
left
a
tremendously
fluffy
off
white
3
fingered
head
that
stuck
around
over
the
half
hour
that
i
drank
it
poured
cloudy
straw
color
not
as
golden
as
i
expected
upon
first
sniff
i
didnt
get
much
a
little
hops
and
a
little
spicy
notes
but
after
it
warmed
up
the
citrus
hops
really
came
though
first
sip
was
belgian
yeasty
and
some
bitterness
on
the
finish
left
a
medicinal
taste
in
my
mouthvery
earthy
i
decided
to
let
this
warm
for
a
whole
and
was
very
happy
after
about
10
minutes
the
hops
really
came
though
to
balance
the
sweet
malt
good
citrus
and
spice
flavors
all
the
way
through
and
the
yeastyearthy
flavor
faded
into
the
background
but
did
not
disappear
altogether
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
but
the
yeasty
flavors
lingered
on
the
swallowing
very
interseting
beer
i
would
try
again
and
give
other
belgian
ipas
a
chance
not
a
bad
beer
very
hoppy
of
course
it
is
called
hopit
had
a
wee
bit
of
a
bitter
taste
to
it
not
my
favorite
but
really
have
been
wanting
to
try
the
other
belgian
beers
that
are
made
by
urthel
wish
i
could
have
tried
a
white
or
a
tripel
from
these
guys
this
beer
disappoints
me
and
i
hope
that
this
bottle
was
bad
and
that
what
i
got
was
just
bad
luck
really
i
hope
thats
what
it
is
i
cant
write
anymore
about
the
subject
words
fall
short
im
genuinely
bummed
drinkability
is
great
hey
its
nearly
flat
it
has
the
feel
of
a
vodka
and
cranberry
not
a
beer
hehe
this
bottle
was
not
cheap
enough
to
be
a
drain
pour
so
im
going
to
soldier
through
sorry
urthel
ill
make
it
up
to
ya
d
with
all
the
spice
i
dont
enjoy
im
finding
it
difficult
to
finish
the
bottle
mouthfeel
was
really
nice
nice
creamy
rich
mouthfeel
lack
of
carbonation
made
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
partly
cloudy
blonde
with
an
enormous
longlasting
white
head
i
would
not
consider
this
a
hoppy
beer
when
considering
american
hop
monsters
this
falls
more
along
the
lines
of
a
very
good
blonde
tripel
there
is
a
spicy
honey
aroma
contributing
to
its
sweetness
and
containing
a
strong
alcohol
presence
hop
character
disappears
as
soon
as
the
beer
starts
to
warm
up
this
has
a
typical
citrus
hop
and
pale
malt
flavors
of
good
blonde
triples
contains
some
clever
spicy
notes
keeping
it
from
being
just
another
generic
tripel
this
one
is
way
above
average
for
a
european
style
ipa
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
belgian
and
somewhat
unique
it
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
lots
of
head
lacing
and
retention
the
smell
is
fruity
esters
and
lots
of
lemon
clove
and
honey
this
is
a
thick
and
full
bodied
beer
that
starts
out
as
a
very
typical
syrupy
belgian
blonde
replete
with
the
bananas
cloves
lemon
citrus
fruity
esters
and
complex
yeasts
by
the
mid
point
things
change
a
bit
and
the
hops
really
do
kick
in
it
becomes
more
of
a
tangy
vanilla
cream
and
slightly
bitter
ale
there
is
a
rather
prodigious
aftertaste
that
does
compromise
the
drinkability
as
for
the
alcohol
content
i
would
not
have
known
this
was
a
whopping
9
5
abv
unless
i
looked
closely
at
the
bottle
this
beer
does
a
remarkable
job
at
masking
a
high
abv
this
is
a
special
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
pours
out
a
rich
golden
color
with
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
quickly
to
the
massive
fluffy
and
sticky
head
lots
of
plateaus
on
the
head
and
leaves
some
rings
of
raised
lacing
slightly
chillhazed
aroma
is
big
on
the
hops
for
sure
lots
of
herbal
and
floral
character
comes
right
out
at
you
this
is
mixed
with
some
bready
pale
malts
and
honey
alcohol
lets
itself
be
known
but
it
really
just
helps
to
round
it
all
out
slight
peach
and
banana
esters
come
out
as
well
lots
of
honey
sweetness
kicks
off
the
flavor
as
it
intermingles
with
light
crackery
malts
some
white
grape
leads
into
a
hop
profile
that
is
at
once
floral
and
fruity
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
hops
they
are
using
but
im
getting
big
jasmine
notes
the
best
kind
the
sweetness
continues
on
toward
the
finish
where
the
spotlight
is
taken
up
by
some
mild
warming
alcohol
and
a
little
dry
closer
mouthfeel
is
moderate
in
weight
but
leans
just
a
touch
to
the
fuller
side
of
things
carbonation
is
vibrant
but
not
violent
delicious
beer
but
the
overall
sweet
character
and
hefty
abv
keep
the
drinkability
down
just
the
slightest
the
only
major
difference
between
the
ontap
form
and
the
bottle
is
in
the
flavor
i
actually
prefer
this
brew
from
the
bottle
the
yeast
character
is
definitely
more
subdued
out
of
the
bottle
than
it
is
ontap
and
far
more
crisp
coating
like
a
belgian
but
a
tiny
bit
drying
because
of
the
hop
factor
makes
you
want
to
sip
it
faster
than
your
normal
belgian
fare
pours
a
nice
opaque
dark
honey
golden
with
a
very
thick
and
persistent
head
it
is
thicker
than
b
s
in
washington
and
stays
better
than
whipping
cream
on
hot
coco
aroma
is
strong
and
mainly
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
strong
hop
undertone
flavor
balances
hop
and
malt
components
with
a
little
malt
sweetness
and
some
hop
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
bitter
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
ale
this
a
solid
belgian
beer
without
question
the
9
5
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
flavors
complex
reminds
me
in
many
ways
of
another
beer
i
really
enjoyed
houblon
chouffe
dobbelen
ipa
not
as
complex
as
the
chouffe
belgian
ipa
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
very
hoppy
duvel
very
nice
d
an
excellent
combination
of
styles
and
a
trendsetter
among
belgians
intensely
drinkable
despite
its
high
alcohol
content
9
5
ive
been
laying
this
one
down
for
probably
8
months
at
least
and
its
quite
tasty
so
dont
be
afraid
to
do
the
same
pick
some
up
as
soon
as
you
can
i
had
this
right
after
it
came
out
a
few
years
back
and
really
liked
it
then
however
this
time
there
wasnt
as
much
sweetness
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
as
i
remembered
the
hops
seemed
to
take
over
on
this
goaround
drinkability
this
might
be
the
most
aggressive
belgian
ipa
it
certainly
took
more
of
a
page
from
the
west
cost
than
the
other
ones
ive
tried
sharp
crisp
and
dry
and
a
fizzy
carbonation
body

id
go
for
more
but
the
3
50
a
stubby
11
2oz
bottle
is
a
tad
pricey
drinkability
is
poor
hard
to
finish
this
one
there
are
higher
alcohol
beers
that
go
down
a
lot
more
smoothly
in
comparison
quenching
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
has
a
lighter
body
and
a
clean
finish
it
seems
very
refreshing
at
first
and
then
the
abv
sneaks
in
very
tasty
and
i
will
be
enjoying
this
one
again
the
mouth
is
slightly
thick
with
a
touch
of
slickness
this
is
an
easy
drinker
that
is
a
great
one
to
savor
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
this
is
one
to
revisit
on
a
regular
basis
well
done
d
i
highly
reccomend
that
you
try
this
you
may
not
like
it
but
its
certainly
an
experience
that
every
beer
lover
should
have
ill
have
it
again
even
at
5
per
12
oz
bottle
that
should
tell
you
something
served
on
tap
at
brouwers
in
seattle
came
in
the
proper
branded
glassware
a
very
light
tealike
yellow
with
a
mondo
bright
white
head
that
just
sat
atop
the
beer
forever
causing
me
to
have
to
wipe
my
nose
off
after
the
first
few
sips
smell
is
soft
and
very
herbalfloral
and
fresh
an
interesting
style
that
i
had
not
tried
before
still
retains
those
typical
belgian
notes
but
this
is
even
more
abundant
than
expected
with
herbalmedicinal
qualities
overall
interesting
and
fun
but
finishing
the
whole
glass
became
a
slight
chore
d
easy
as
pie
the
smell
and
taste
scores
certainly
approach
being
worthy
of
a
bump
upwards
could
do
it
this
one
got
me
thinking
of
a
bipa
modeled
after
a
two
hearted
or
mash
house
hoppy
hour
mmm
aroma
is
farmy
with
corriander
and
cloves
taste
is
funky
with
definite
belgian
qualities
typical
wheats
cloves
corriander
banana
with
earthy
hops
adds
up
to
a
definite
funk
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
with
over
carbonation
fine
enough
to
drink
not
a
session
beer
but
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
drinkability
high
abv
holds
down
sessionability
but
even
if
it
didnt
this
doesnt
offer
much
aroma
and
flavor
beyond
horseblanket
so
to
me
its
merely
a
decent
beer
and
not
one
id
seek
out
often
thanks
to
julia
and
jason
at
bruisin
ales
for
trying
this
out
with
me
tonight
poured
was
a
delicously
looking
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
that
never
faded
and
lots
of
sticky
white
lace
lots
of
hop
in
the
aroma
but
not
your
citrus
hop
bomb
this
was
how
do
you
say
a
bit
more
refined
it
seemed
lots
of
subtle
back
flavors
banana
fig
pears
were
evident
in
the
flavor
along
with
the
extremely
pleasant
hop
flavor
absolutly
no
presence
of
the
alcohol
could
be
detected
which
was
a
shock
at
over
9
such
a
delicous
and
complex
offering
here
light
and
frothy
feel
on
the
palate
lots
of
carbonation
and
just
a
smooth
silky
feel
this
is
truly
a
belgian
made
for
me
a
great
kinda
crossover
for
the
hophead
to
try
and
branch
out
into
something
new
would
definatly
recommend
this
for
anyone
to
try
and
need
to
pick
up
a
bottle
speaking
of
warmth
no
alcohol
heat
whatsoever
scary
for
9
plus
just
a
smooth
and
drinkable
ale
the
body
is
soft
without
being
pushed
over
just
enough
backbone
to
not
be
onesided
and
bitter
outstanding
belgian
beer
and
outstanding
ipa
next
time
im
going
for
the
750
ml
i
get
2
inches
of
body
and
4
inches
of
light
tan
head
that
jumps
out
of
the
glass
literaly
nose
is
up
front
wheat
in
the
raw
and
very
yeasty
includes
a
light
hoppy
feel
with
metalic
mineral
notes
leaves
nice
lace
after
the
head
finally
fades
a
bit
smooth
mellow
mouth
feeling
is
softly
balanced
with
bitter
hops
and
yeasty
wheat
feel
this
is
very
well
balanced
and
overall
silky
even
with
the
sharp
bitter
bites
here
and
there
not
what
i
expected
by
the
name
but
yummy
none
the
less
super
easy
drinking
mellow
mouthfeel
i
would
define
this
beer
as
a
bitter
pilsner
with
a
belgian
yeast
underpinning
i
would
not
place
this
in
the
realm
of
ipas
a
fun
beer
to
try
but
one
is
plenty
for
one
sitting
i
would
try
again
if
have
the

for

was
pretty
good

this
is
indicative
of
the

i
like
a

very
much

will
have
to
seek
out
more

wonderful
blend

and
american
hops

excellent
a
great

and
this
is
a
shining
example
of
it
bring
on
more
fresh
versions
and
it
will
be
purchased
in

the

balanced
nicely
with

high

that
left
a

a

in

for
being
9

percent

decent
drinkability

almost
too
carbonated
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
overall
tastes
like
it
smells
pretty
good
but
uneven
the
yeast
and
malt
are
very
brownsugary
sweet
and
if
they
were
cut
into
more
sufficiently
by
the
hops
itd
be
great
but
instead
the
hops
serve
only
to
compliment
them
d
more
drinkable
to
me
compared
to
many
other
belgians
i
have
tried
as
it
isnt
as
sweet
as
many
of
the
others
mouthfeeldrinkability
at
first
this
beer
was
drinking
almost
to
perfection
creamy
slick
and
responsive
im
now
halfway
through
the
bottle
one
hour
later
and
its
lost
most
of
its
carbonation
and
consequently
its
interest
you
must
be
gentler
than
usual
with
pouring
this
one
as
not
only
the
yeast
plays
a
role
but
so
does
the
aggressive
head
a
challenge
to
review
and
maybe
more
of
a
nemesis
to
just
relax
and
enjoy
drinkable
i
guess
but
at
least
from
this
sample
not
worth
drinking
i
love
belgian

de

houblon
chouffe
both
much
better
much
more
interesting
examples
of
the
style
everyones
raved
so
much
about
this
beer
that
i
feel
obligated
to
try
it
again
maybe
in

urthel

pours
a

with
a
huge
white
head
from
a
brown
750
ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
so
is
the
taste
there
is
a
huge
hop
flavor
but
its
definitely
different
than
the
typical
american
ipa
the
noble
hops
definitely
are
a
different
twist
than
im
used
to
in
an
ipa
but
its
quite
a
pleasant
twist
recommended

the

with

flying
around
everywhere
and
a
nice
display
of
hops
as
well
upon
the
first
sip
the
flavors
just
explode
in
your
mouth
much
like
the
aroma
spices
dance
all
over
the
tongue
and
the
hops
are
there
to
give
it
an
extra
punch
overall
this
is
an
extremely
well
crafted
brew
that
is
extraordinarily
drinkable
despite
its
high
abv
highly
recommended
this
is
just
an
excellent
beer
one
i
am
always
happy
to
see
whenever
i
see
it
on
tap
whether
on
the
left
coast
or
the
right
just
a
very
solid
beer
great
drinkability
my
first
experience
with
a
belgian
ipa
all
in
all
good
belgian
ipa
not
as
exciting
as
i
had
anticipated
or
hoped
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
a
nice
belgian
tripel
on
steroids
i
was
not
blown
away

and
still
erupted
from

for

is
oddly

i
get
the

as

like
a
belgian
golden
ale
with
an
addition
of
american

hops
im
upping
my

a
bit

is
good

this

foamy

with
very
good

smells
of
coriander
and
citrus
with
a
hint
of
pine
tastes
the
same
as
the
smell
it
is
like
a
cross
between
titan
ipa
and
duvel
very
different
could
only
drink
one
bottle
but
would
never
turn
one
down
never
pass
it
up
if
you
have
the
chance
i
shared
this
bottle
and
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
so
im
sure
i
could
handle
one
myself
while
a
belgian
ipa
is
not
my
drink
of
choice
this
one
seems
to
be
very
drinkable
recommended
for
sure
drinkability
unfortunately
cant
be
scored
too
highly
as
this
baby
is
9
5
i
would
say
its
better
than
average
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
rather
dry
and
exremely
drinkable
nice
combonation
of
styles
dvery
good
the
combination
of
the
two
styles
creates
a
very
interesting
blend
in
this
beer
as
a
huge
fan
of
the
american
ipas
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
all
of
the
delicious
hoppy
bitterness
but
displayed
in
an
entirely
different
way
than
i
am
used
to
not
a
beer
i
would
go
for
very
frequently
and
a
casual
drinker
probably
would
not
enjoy
it
but
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
and
interesting
choice
for
me
drinkability
gave
this
fairly
high
marks
because
its
only
the
second
belgian
ipa
i
have
had
and
liked
it
a
bit
better
than
the
la
chouffe
offering
great
flavors
very
well
done
i
split
this
bottle
with
stopper
poured
at
cellar
temp
into
a
snifter
i
get
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
creamy
bleached
white
head
that
rests
as
a
surface
layer
that
leaves
some
tight
lattice
as
i
drink
aroma
is
light
and
fruity
with
white
grapes
and
pear
but
also
a
little
boozy
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
slight
syrupy
texture
and
very
fine
tingly
carbonation
flavor
is
sweet
and
candi
sugar
is
prevelant
but
does
allow
for
some
general
fruitiness
and
a
fairly
bitter
finish
in
the
middle
the
finish
is
lingering
sweet
fruit
a
very
easy
drinker
with
no
hint
of
abv
mouthfeel
astringent
slightly
warming
and
very
cleansing
a
nice
belgian
interpretation
of
an
ipa
d
this
hybrid
is
a
veritable
smorgasbord
of
flavors
showing
big
tripel
sweetness
and
ipa
spiciness
i
prefer
the
beer
out
of
a
75
cl
bottle
but
it
does
remarkably
well
in
the
small
bottles
as
i
recall
i
paid
about
12
for
the
750
ml
bottle
making
this
an
indulgence
not
a
house
standard
i
cant
say
its
worth
the
money
but
i
certainly
wont
complain
about
the
elegant
belgian
styling
the
festive
crown
of
foam
or
graceful
drinkability
the
gently
contoured
quaffable
body
spewing
starched
cavernous
lace
was
quite
pleasing
as
well
but
theres
no
need
to
think
of
this
as
something
of
a
northwest
influenced
belgian
ipa
it
isnt
ive
been
really
impressed
with
urthel
and
this
is
no
exception
i
cant
wait
until
hildegards
latest
formula
reaches
these
shores
my
first
belgian
ipa
what
a
unique
style
great
spicy
clove
aromas
with
a
signature
sourness
from
the
yeasts
paired
with
a
moderate
hoppy
punch
and
citrusy
sweet
charaters
the
two
brews
blended
very
nicely
the
fruitiness
played
well
with
the
bitter
hops
all
the
way
to
the
finish
not
overly
sweet
or
heavy
but
the
alcohol
is
easily
is
noted
wonder
what
makes
the
belgian
drinkers
so
hopphobic
because
this
stuff
is
delicious
d
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
is
present
but
also
very
well
hidden
for
9
5
the
beer
came
as
a
clear
pale
gold
with
a
very
nice
fluffy
white
head
with
good
retention
the
taste
was
of
hops
and
alcohol
kind
of
melded
together
with
a
strong
berry
undertone
similar
to
duvel
in
the
sense
that
it
was
almost
champagney
although
the
hops
stood
out
a
little
more
quite
drinkable
for
a
9
5
if
you
dig
hoppy
belgians
this
is
for
you
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
a
great
representation
of
what
is
possible
with
a
little
experimentation
a
great
beer
drinking
experience
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
an
oversized
wine

a
beautiful
cloudy
amber
with
two
full
fingers
of
fluffy
dense

a
very
spicy
hoppy
aroma
that
carries
on
into
the
flavor
tastes
of
fruity
peppery
hops
rich
malt
and
a
hint
of
apricot
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
quite
refreshing
considering
the
high
alcohol
full
bodied
with
moderate
amounts
of
carbonation
really
drinkable

its

the
creamy

that
never
goes
away
balances
the
bitter

if
this
brew
had
more
of
a
maltbackbone
this
would
of
scored
a
perfect
5
for
me
the
taste
is
like
most
belgiums
difficult
to
nail
down
alcoholic
notes
strong
with
a
slight
fruit
note

than
the
hoppy
american
microbrews
to
be
sure

overall
i
love
this

and
always
keep

it

it
was
a
special
treat
to
find
it

find
it
get

you
did
poured
from
a

chose
the
glassware
out
of
ingnorance
and
taste
the
appearance
is
slightly
hazy
pale
orange
with
clumpy
islands
of
foam
on
top
the
smell
is
not
as
overly
hoppy
as
i
expected
its
more
muted
with
a
sweet
belgian
yeastie
aroma
in
the
background
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
slight
bite
of
hops
with
belgian
yeast
in
the
mix
and
a
slightly
sour
taste
on
the
backend
really
nice
thick
mouthfeel
and
delicious
flavor
keep
the
drinkability
high
although
the
high
alcohol
content
not
detected
in
the
flavor
could
be
dangerous
d
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
although
a
bit
more
hop
presence
would
be
nice
at
4
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
however
this
is
one
that
is
passable
unless
you
really
are
itching
to
try
it
well
this
is
a
weird
beer
not
quite
an
ipa
but
not
a
belgian
pale
ale
either
i
can
say
that
this
is
the
most
pineapple
tasting
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
would
i
buy
a
bottle
of
this
to
give
it
a
retest
maybe
but
i
really
would
jump
on
a
three
floyd
dreadnaught
first
drinkability
good
hoppiness
to
provide
balance
however
definitely
a
hoppy
beer
which
would
make
it
a
little
hard
to
finish
a
big
bottle
share
this
with
your
friends
and
enjoy
this
beer
was
quite
a
surprise
to
find
the
color
is
golden
with
a
voracious
bubble
pattern
that
continues
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
a
large
head
that
leaves
an
interesting
lacing
pattern
on
the
glass
its
curious
for
a
beer
called
hopit
i
am
not
able
to
make
out
any
hoppyness
in
the
taste
at
all
the
initial
taste
is
a
bit
like
citrus
the
end
is
much
more
bitter
but
its
not
a
hoppy
bitterness
but
more
of
a
yeasty
bitterness
the
finish
is
terrific
with
more
of
a
lingering
lemonlike
taste
quite
a
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
vaguely
orange
gold
under
a
huge
three
finger
white
head
with
great
contour
and
lace
as
it
slowing
fades
along
the
sides
leaving
a
tower
in
the
middle
reminiscent
of
the
bad
lands
truly
spectacular
appearance
from
first
pour
to
final
sip
the
nose
does
not
keep
pace
as
it
is
disappointingly
mild
with
just
a
hint
of
fruit
and
spice
but
nothing
identifiable
as
hops
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
slightly
syrupy
leaving
a
bit
of
residue
on
the
tongue
the
opening
taste
is
mildly
sweet
and
fruity
followed
by
a
slow
crescendo
of
spicey
then
espresso
then
acrid
hops
culminating
in
a
very
dry
very
crisp
aftertaste
of
bitter
never
overwhelming
the
hops
are
nonetheless
the
dominant
taste
what
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
belgium
great
offering
a
nice
beer
to
go
with
a
greek
salad
definitly
a
must
try
if
looking
for
an
emerging
style
name
is
a
little
much
as
the
hops
are
slightly
downplayed
against
other
flavors
and
scents
d
not
a
chance
too
heavy
on
the
hops
that
i
couldnt
really
enjoy
it
so
much
so
we
opened
up
a
arrogant
bastard
after
this
and
it
didnt
have
the
same
bite
that
it
normally
does
if
you
want
to
experiment
and
try
something
at
will
kick
your
tongue
in
the
ass
then
go
for
it
bottom
line
this
was
too
hoppy
for
me
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
the
head
is
a
billowy
four
fingers
in
height
and
recedes
very
slowly
lacing
is
thick
lasting
until
the
last
sip
is
gone
and
leaving
rings
and
clouds
of
foam
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
earthy
and
yeasty
the
taste
is
where
is
hops
are
in
this
beer
the
earthy
and
yeasty
notes
which
are
upfront
in
the
aroma
are
in
the
background
in
the
taste
they
are
nearly
covered
up
by
a
green
resiny
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
ligher
than
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
it
is
as
if
the
normal
flavors
of
a
belgian
ale
and
the
hops
are
at
war
with
one
another
and
like
in
all
war
everyone
is
the
loser
nothing
in
this
beer
seems
to
be
in
harmony
with
anything
else
a
fellow
ba
once
said
i
can
tell
you
if
a
beer
is
made
well
and
i
can
tell
you
if
i
like
it
i
can
tell
that
this
is
a
well
made
beer
and
i
bet
a
loe
of
other
hop
heads
out
there
love
it
but
i
dont
has
a
subtle
sweetness
that
turns
a
citrus
hoppy
middle
full
of
flavor
finishes
with
apricot
fruity
and
hoppy
and
finally
lingering
bitterness
that
lasts
long
mouthfeel
was
fairly
creamy
but
enough
bite
through
to
the
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
dont
know
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
glass
its
not
overly
hoppy
but
along
with
the
high
abv
it
adds
up
over
time
definitely
something
im
going
to
get
again
d
all
in
all
a
fine
tasty
hopped
up
belgian
had
this
in
a
small
bottlenot
sure
i
could
drink
a
big
guy
by
myself
a
fine
brew
really
tasty
but
there
was
so
much
junk
floating
around
in
it
color
of
clear
golden
honey

head
thick
and
white

nose
of

bitter

hopps

airy
bright
heavily
carbonated

this
is

had
me
thinking
it
would
have
more
hop
character
than
it
actually
does
the
ibus
are
certainly
higher
than
normal
but
the
hop
flavor
is
really
rather
mild
either
way
its
still
very
drinkable
but
the
abv
will
hold
you
in
check
a
bit
very
drinkable
as
i
said
solid
brew
to
finish
out
a
weekend
of
great
beglian
ales
drinkability
was
outstanding
so
smooth
easy
on
the
palate
and
perfect
with
a
variety
of
foods
i
was
absolutely
amazed
to
discover
that
it
was
9
5
abv
mouthfeel
was
tongue
tingling
fullbodied
this
is
a
filling
sipper
i
will
find
this
one
again
the
mouth
seemed
rather
light
and
lacked
complexity
its
drinkable
but
not
all
that
interesting
i
was
quite
disappointed
bottle
courtesy
of
hogtownharry
poured
a
deep
hazy
light
beige
color
ale
with
a
big
white
foamy
head
with
perfect
retention
aroma
of
saaz
hops
is
easily
identifiable
with
some
noticeable
spices
and
a
very
interesting
belgian
yeast
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
spices
which
may
includes
some
white
pepper
slightly
funky
yeast
and
a
dry
hoppy
finish
body
is
a
bit
light
and
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
this
beer
is
an
interesting
experiment
for
sure
which
i
wouldnt
mind
revisiting
again
pours
a
gorgeous
hazy
gold
with
a
huge
sticky
bright
white
head
there
are
lacing
rings
on
my
glass
like
the
rings
of
a
tree
trunk
beautiful
the
aroma
has
some
nice
spice
notes
of
clove
and
white
pepper
citric
hops
redolent
of
lemon
dominate
the
nose
with
just
a
touch
of
belgian
malt
character
poking
through
not
a
terribly
hoppy
nose
on
the
palate
the
hops
are
quite
present
for
a
belgian
brew
but
middling
to
my
american
palate
initially
the
palate
is
rather
sweet
it
doesnt
dry
out
until
the
finish
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
either
but
in
this
case
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
detracts
a
bit
from
the
hop
notes
drinks
well
especially
for
a
high
abv
beer
this
one
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
some
other
hoppy
belgians
in
my
opinion
pours
a
very
nice
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
awesome
creamy
white
head
tons
of
lacing
through
out
the
drink
scents
of
hops
malts
citrus
and
yeast
the
taste
is
awesome
of
hops
fruits
and
malts
a
nice
tangy
flavor
with
a
nice
bitehop
finish
medium
body
a
complex
brew
very
drinkable
ive
been
wanting
to
drink
this
ever
since
i
got
it
56
months
ago
very
tasty
and
highly
recommended
very
true
to
the
style
drinkability
was
not
too
good
i
couldnt
tell
exactly
what
the
intentions
were
for
this
beer
the
closest
comparison
would
be
a
saison
dupont
dryhopped
in
oak
for
year
the
yeast
strength
of
this
beer
just
does
not
work
with
the
hops
this
should
be
rated
in
the
90s
try
it
very
good
beer
thats
a
little
different
from
anything
ive
had
before
definitely
a
brew
that
bends
the
borders
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
i
like
the
balance
of
spicyness
and
bitterness
bright
and
clear
gold
color
almost
a
pilsner
straw
the
beer
is
topped
by
a
fluffy
white
head
wonderful
head
retention
this
beer
isnt
going
to
show
the
staying
power
of
the
chouffe
beer
but
im
not
disappointed
by
what
i
see
straight
forward
approach
to
the
aroma
some
mild
grapefruit
hops
just
a
little
earth
soil
and
a
light
mix
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
mild
orange
citrus
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
citrus
up
front
kind
of
a
simcoe
mandarin
orange
but
its
much
softer
than
most
simcoe
beers
the
earthiness
extends
into
the
finish
of
the
beer
where
i
also
find
just
a
touch
of
spicy
heat
maybe
a
little
white
pepper
slick
and
mildly
smooth
mouth
feel
nice
drinkability
lots
of
comparisons
between
this
beer
and
the
houblin
chouffe
ill
take
the
chouffe
its
a
much
more
complete
beer
cheers
beertracker
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
carbonated
very
refreshing
but
almost
to
thin
or
would
have
scored
higher
light
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
frothy
snow
white
head
aromas
of
banana
and
citrus
fruit
with
a
spicy
yeasty
character
flavors
match
the
nose
with
a
slightly
drying
finish
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
but
undeniably
pleasing
all
the
same
clearly
one
of
the
better
belgian
pale
ales
ive
tried
i
did
not
have
any
of
the
gusher
carbonation
problems
that
other
reviewers
did
but
of
course
this
was
just
one
bottle
bought
in
concord
mass
at
colonial
a
very
well
stocked
outlet
that
competes
quite
well
with
yankee
spirits
especially
considering
their
superior
knowledge
and
care
they
seem
to
take
with
product
so
either
the
other
merchants
are
storing
it
and
treating
it
poorly
no
surprise
or
their
only
fault
is
in
consistency
please
say
it
aint
so
750
ml
corkncap
bottle
conditioned
with
loads
of
info
about
the
beer
on
the
silkscreened
label
the
cork
was
extremely
anxious
to
come
out
essentially
coming
out
on
its
own
and
then
proceeding
to
foam
over
the
first
pour
delivers
a
ridiculously
huge
head
my
full
tulip
has
only
a
half
an
inch
of
beer
in
the
bottom
it
takes
a
good
30
minutes
to
get
the
head
to
reduce
enough
to
leave
me
with
a
halffull
glass
and
because
of
the
dense
head
i
could
tease
it
to
3
fingers
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
an
unfiltered
goldenamber
with
low
carbonation
but
becomes
highly
carbonated
after
some
swirling
and
the
white
head
is
big
creamy
sticky
and
incredibly
dense
i
can
tilt
the
tulip
to
almost
horizontal
and
the
head
doesnt
budge
as
i
drink
an
amazing
amount
of
foam
sticks
to
the
glass
as
much
as
34
of
an
inch
thick
making
a
gaze
into
the
glass
seem
like
a
glimpse
into
a
foam
cavern
it
smells
of
hops
juicy
apples
medicinalperfumy
phenols
some
fruits
and
a
spiciness
hopit
has
a
big
bitterness
with
sharp
esters
and
perfumy
phenols
grapefruitgrassyspicyraw

oils
lemon
rind
coriander
apple
cider
watermelon
pear
light
mustiness
and
spiciness
and
sweet
malts
that
appear
near
the
end
it
has
a
big
body
and
an
extremely
long
finish
and
is
overall
a
nice
and
complex
brew
but
it
can
be
a
bit
trying
at
times
and
the
head
was
definitely
annoying
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
for
early
fall
weather
enjoy
drinkability
and
notes
despite
the
inauspicious
start
to
this
review
urthel
hopit
is
a
nice
interpretation
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
fruity
and
spicy
with
an
ample
amount
of
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
dry
to
the
finish
with
the
hop
bitterness
lingering
long
after
the
finish
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
profile
but
you
can
feel
its
warming
effects
definitely
worth
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
and
one
i
will
buy
again
maybe
next
time
ill
get
more
the
one
pour
out
of
it
seek
out
and
enjoy
drinkabilityoverall
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
achouffes
amerbelgian
ipa
tripel
but
distinct
in
its
funky
fruit
an
interesting
new
style
to
ponder
an
almost
clear
golden
hue
with
mountainous
rocky
white
head
smells
a
wee
bit
phenolic
with
pepper
and
spicy
earthy
hops
not
as
generous
here
as
i
would
have
expected
hops
are
the
story
here
a
dry
belgian
style
ipa
initially
a
stab
of
fruity
hoppiness
immediately
gives
way
to
earthy
spicy
hops
riding
atop
lightly
toasted
malts
with
some
fruity
esters
thrown
intropical
the
yeast
characteristics
and
hop
flavors
meld
together
seamlessy
very
difficult
to
tell
where
one
ends
and
the
next
begins
tremendously
well
balanced
finishes
dry
with
spicy
pepper
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
substantial
carbonation
very
creamy
very
drinkable
extremely
well
put
together
im
a
fan
this
crisp
rich
brew
is
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
as
far
as
belgians
are
concerned
considering
how
hoppy
it
is
dont
get
me
wrong
belgians
certainly
know
how
to
hop
a
beer
when
they
want
to
duval
anyone
but
most
of
their
beers
tend
to
be
malty
and
alcoholic
this
one
was
all
that
but
was
nicely
balanced
by
a
great
hop
spice
im
told
this
is
a
belgian
interpretation
of
the
american
ipa
style
if
it
is
i
would
say
it
is
more
balanced
and
hides
its
alcohol
level
better
than
many
american
ipas
but
whatever
style
it
is
its
a
real
treat
highly
recommended
drinkability
starts
out
very
nice
but
after
a
while
the
hops
in
the
finish
really
start
to
get
at
me
and
the
feel
of
the
beer
becomes
rather
unpleasant
and
quite
mixed
up
the
creamy
fruity
front
just
starts
clashing
with
the
dry
hoppy
super
bitter
finish
especially
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temp
by
the
end
of
a
glass
i
am
not
reaching
for
another
on
the
other
hand
this
would
be
a
gem
for
the
end
of
a
long
session
as
i
would
find
the
varying
sensations
appealing
at
that
point
d
good
for
all
occasions
a
little
beguiling
easy
to
drink
despite
its
high
abv
content
definitely
not
a
gulping
beer
750ml
bottle
dark
gold
almost
amber
in
color
with
a
huge
off
white
head
which
hung
around
until
the
end
the
aroma
was
bubblegum
sweet
clove
spicy
and
some
flower
scent
roses
taste
was
to
me
somewhat
unbalanced
at
first
typical
belgian
trippel
at
start
extra
sweet
grapefruit
caramel
vinous
diacetyl
then
a
huge
hop
finish
that
was
very
bitter
less
sweet
grapefruit
as
the
beer
warmed
the
flavors
came
together
and
blended
into
a
much
more
pleasing
taste
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
somewhat
drying
drinkability
again
seemed
to
depend
on
temperature
and
improved
as
beer
warmed
abv
was
well
hidden
for
what
it
is
worth
i
think
the
la
chouffe
trippel
dipa
is
the
better
combination
this
came
in
the
coolest
glass
ever
head
was
around
an
inch
tall
and
body
was
transparent
gold
nose
reminded
me
of
a
circus
for
some
reason
cotton
candy
grapefruit
and
a
weird
pleasant
barnyard
smell
taste
was
candi
sugar
white
grapes
a
bit
of
grapefruit
mouth
was
nice
and
smooth
id
order
it
on
tap
again
but
im
not
in
a
huge
rush
to
reexperience
it
urthel
has
brewed
another
excellent
beer
alcohol
is
masked
completely
which
is
scary
since
this
is
9
5
a
little
overpriced
but
worth
it
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
hoppy
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
thanks
again
brian
for
the
enlightenment

somewhat
lower

then
expectedrubber
like
and
sulfury
all
in
one
reminds
me
on
a
new
sneaker
actually
not
as
much

presence
in
the
aroma
as
i
would
have
expected
big

flavor
somewhat
of

so
then
any
other
belgian
going
for
sure
nice
balance
between
the
belgian
yeast
characteristics
and
the
malts
and
hops
i
had
to
go
back
and
change
the
flavor
rating
its
really
growing
on
me
good
mouthfeelquite
bright
on
the
palatelingering
bitterness
very
very
drinkable
beer
indeed
well
worth
enjoying
by
hop
heads
belgian
fans
and
just
plain
beer
fans
very
impressive
about
10
seconds
after
i
took
the
cage
off
the
750ml
the
cork
exploded
out
of
the
bottle
without
my
touching
it
after
my
heart
stoped
racing
and
i
cleaned
my
pants
i
got
into
this
beer
amazing
head
light
cream
colored
with
a
creamy
texture
it
held
itself
aloft
about
half
an
inch
above
the
top
of
the
glass
almost
transparent
golden
beer
shows
little
of
the
carbonation
that
expelled
the
cork
and
produced
a
four
finger
head
did
i
mention
the
lace
its
all
over
the
place
the
aroma
is
hard
to
describe
faintly
sweet
with
spicy
floral
notes
thats
kind
of
a
simple
description
but
youll
have
to
try
it
for
more
details
a
little
bit
of
sweet
caramel
malt
on
top
of
some
candied
grapefruit
and
a
kind
of
grass
spiciness
from
the
hops
a
little
bitter
in
the
finish
but
nothing
you
cant
handle
fluffy
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
smooth
experience
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
carbonation
just
wont
stay
in
the
beer
second
pour
beer
was
cool
to
room
temp
produced
about
half
an
inch
of
beer
and
four
inches
of
head
which
is
more
like
a
foam
barrier
to
the
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
when
i
bought
this
beer
but
it
is
plenty
interesting
i
dig
the
flavor
and
as
it
warms
there
is
a
yeasty
flavor
that
appears
at
9a
750ml
i
probably
wont
be
drinking
it
all
that
often
but
maybe
thats
a
good
thing
d
delicious
and
easygoing
for
9
5
abv
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
750ml
but
can
drink
this
one
easily
new
taste
makes
me
want
to
take
one
sip
after
another
a
decent
enough
belgain
with
a
unique
twist
on
the
tradition
pales
ive
had
hard
to
believe
this
is
actually
9
5
as
its
hard
to
find
it
anywhere
not
even
after
drinking
a
bunch
of
it
so
its
drinkability
is
solid
a
good
brew
no
doubt
but
there
are
far
better
more
complexing
belgians
for
less
the
price
if
you
came
looking
for
a
belgian
ipa
i
dont
think
so
it
is
a
nice
highly
enjoyable
belgian
ale
however
drinkability
a
great
new
belgian
for
me
i
definitely
recommend
it
wouldve
given
a
perfect
score
for
taste
if
it
werent
for
the
slightly
odd
aftertaste
other
than
that
which
is
probably
just
a
weird
hops
residue
this
is
insanely
delicious
the
very
next
day
i
tried
a
pint
on
tap
and
the
bitterness
was
more
watered
down
as
was
the
creaminessa
big
head
and
still
full
mouthfeel
three
years
later
and
ontap
and
it
was
good
complexity
and
a
great
tap
beer
this
is
not
what
you
would
expect
from
your
typical
belgian
ale
it
has
a
great
appearance
golden
color
thick
head
that
bubbles
away
leaving
a
nice
lace
the
smell
is
definitely
pale
maybe
even
a
little
wheaty
but
not
syrupy
like
a
typical
belgian
what
stood
out
about
this
beer
most
for
me
was
the
distinct
spicy
flavor
there
is
a
lot
of
hops
but
they
are
more
fruity
and
citrusy
but
the
spice
lets
you
know
its
there
too
its
and
interesting
flavor
i
really
couldnt
tell
if
i
liked
it
much
or
not
it
was
just
interesting
id
describe
this
as
a
belgian
imperial
pilsner
pours
beautifully
with
a
fluffy
white
head
and
golden
yellow
body
great
lacing
strong
european
pils
hop
aroma
i
have
trouble
picking
out
any
specific
scents
with
this
one
maybe
the
mixture
is
just
too
strong
taste
has
a
bit
of
typical
belgian
spice
with
a
faint
pilsner
malt
backbone
a
little
bit
of
grapefruit
pine
and
fruit
again
hard
to
discern
flavors
in
this
one
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
but
not
that
tasty
overall
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
very
hoppy
duvel
nice
hopbeer
good
balanced
despite
the
heft
this
goes
down
easy
on
nice
colorado
spring
evening
would
love
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
great
representation
of
the
style
body
is
big
sticky
creamy
and
slick
despite
the
strength
it
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
nice
d
meidum
nice
belgian
the
hoppy
kick
may
turn
off
some
but
i
like
it
had
this
on
tap
at
my
favorite
barrestaurant
poured
into
a
small
goblet
with
the
beers
name
on
the
side
and
a
little
hobbitlooking
guy
on
the
side
hopit
word
play
on
hobbit
i
assumed
it
had
a
really
nice
goldenorangepale
color
and
a
thick
white
head
this
beer
smelled
kind
of
yeasty
which
im
usually
not
so
into
but
i
ended
up
liking
it
a
lot
it
had
that
signature
belgian
fruitspiceyeast
flavor
but
more
hopped
up
and
some
crisp
citrus
notes
the
high
abv
was
definitely
apparent
in
the
taste
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
freakin
9
5
pretty
awesome
lacing
action
too
the
head
was
clinging
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
for
dear
life
ive
never
seen
a
beer
lace
like
that
before
hence
the
5
0
for
appearance
id
drink
it
again
once
or
twice
served
in
an
authentic
urthel
glass
poured
up
a
slightly
hazy
medium
golden
orange
color
with
a
generous
foamy
offwhite
head
head
stuck
around
a
good
ten
minutes
before
subsiding
leaving
behind
tattered
lacing
aromas
of
grassy
hops
grain
husk
light
must
and
moderate
fusels
slightly
phenolic
certainly
hoppy
for
a
belgian
with
a
lingering
bitterness
akin
to
apa
very
strong
yet
the
higher
hopping
level
seems
to
mask
it
well
a
fair
bit
of
biscuity
malt
sweetness
to
keep
it
wellrounded
a
little
too
strong
to
be
good
sessioner
but
a
couple
will
do
you
right
a
nicely
constructed
ale
thats
right
up
there
with
some
of
my
other
favorite
belgian
pales
from
a
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
this
beer
was
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
held
up
to
the
light
i
could
thousands
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
aroma
was
very
perfumy
hoppy
and
citrusy
taste
was
excellent
a
combination
of
malt
spice
belgian
candi
sugar
yeast
and
citrus
this
beer
had
a
very
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
and
was
quite
easy
to
drink
the
9
5
abv
stated
on
the
bottle
was
barely
noticeable
this
is
an
unusual
beer
sort
of
a
belgian
ipa
but
it
is
very
tasty
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
wellmade
beer
just
not
sure
of
the
real
style
at
work
here
definitely
a
belgian
influenced
ipa
but
the
combination
of
belgianenglish
styles
just
doesnt
seem
to
mesh
all
that
well
here
sort
of
almost
boring
in
a
way
750ml
bottle
slightly
cloudy
golden
orange
with
some
floaties
and
a
big
frothy
white
head
huge
clumps
of
lace
and
sticky
rings
of
lacing
were
left
all
over
the
glass
nice
hoppy
citric
bitterness
with
some
slightly
sweet
fruit
notes
in
the
aroma
some
spiciness
and
doughy
malts
as
well
flavor
is
nicely
bitter
up
front
with
citric
hops
and
a
yeasty
malt
doughiness
nice
notes
of
sweet
fruits
in
the
middle
with
some
spicy
hops
finish
up
the
taste
pretty
damn
thick
and
full
body
with
perfect
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
beer
to
me
i
had
no
clue
it
was
almost
10
till
i
was
done
with
the
beer
and
was
looking
over
the
bottle
it
pretty
much
nails
the
idea
of
a
belgian
ipa
in
my
opinion
this
beer
poured
a
goldencolor
with
a
wellformed
head
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
unique
there
is
a
hop
bitterness
that
excedes
any
other
belgian
i
have
tried
but
not
in
an
overpoweringpuckering
type
of
way
that
the
most
bitter
american
beers
are
characterized
by
the
bitterness
is
consistent
from
the
moment
it
hits
the
toungue
to
when
it
goes
down
it
is
countered
by
spiciness
and
a
slight
sweetness
that
on
the
whole
it
is
a
delicious
and
beautifully
crafted
beer
it
certainly
is
different
and
really
it
survives
trying
to
be
many
things
to
many
people
the
intriguing
blend
of
american
and
noble
hops
along
with
belgian
presence
bring
a
lot
to
the
table
but
it
works
nicely
the
abv
is
felt
well
more
than
tasted
so
its
a
caution
but
it
still
drinks
warmly
and
with
exercised
wisdom
free
of
any
regrets
large

i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
hildegard
and
her
friendly
hubby
at
asns
ultimate
belgian
fest
last
night
since
this
is
the
melding
of
2
of
my
favorite
styles
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
cloudy
dull
light
orangey
amber
near
white
head
pillowy
and
leaving
a
thick
tiny

film
as
well
as
world
class
lacing
and

this
is
exquisitely
tasty
and
complex
stuff
notes

fruity
and
crisply
hoppy
late
magnum
spalt
and
saaz
hops
seal
the
deal
ah
cultural
diffusion
belgiumusai
want
more
of
this
classy
brewill
buy
a
case
of
bombers
the
first
chance
i
get
ive
heard
this
one
described
as
a
belgian
take
on
an
american
ipa
the
hops
didnt
come
through
as
stongly
as
i
expected
leaving
this
beer
tasting
more
like
a
belgian
blond
than
ipa
the
lacing
was
pure
ipa
though
thick
rings
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
alcohol
all
9
5
of
it
is
well
hidden
so
dont
let
the
drinkability
fool
you
i
would
have
liked
more
complexity
or
more
bite
a
different
kind
of
belgian
tasty
and
if
you
like
pilsners
youll
really
like
this
one
the
beer
after
removing
the
wire
basket
and
cork
greeted
me
with
a
nice
pop
something
i
like
to
hear
from
these
beers
then
the
pour
revealed
a
sparkling
golden
yellow
body
with
a
mastodonic
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
lasted
for
quite
a
spell
upon
its
depletion
the
lace
formed
a
tight
screen
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
a
perfect
blend
of
hop
floral
spiciness
from
the
saaz
hops
with
a
sweet
over
ripe
orange
and
pineapple
tone
crisp
and
refreshing
a
real
treat
for
the
olfactory
and
ocular
senses
start
is
sweet
and
tart
grain
profile
splendiferous
and
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
pertinent
acidic
bite
the
sweetness
lingers
long
and
the
hops
take
their
place
at
the
rear
giving
a
satisfying
twang
to
the
old
taste
buds
a
real
nice
beer
id
say
another
sharp
edge
offering
where
else
can
you
get
urthel
hopit
and
hop
it
they
did
i
like

american
inspiration
behind
this

this

really
tasty
beer
its
nice
an
hoppy
but
still
characteristically
belgian
in
character
fantastic
idea
of
what
an

brewed
by
a
belgian
would
be
like
go
find
this
beer
and
consume
it
will
put
a

silly
belgians
puttin
hops
in
their
beerlots
of
hops
a
growing
experiment
among
belgians
loading
their
pale
ales
with
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
taking
some
hints
from
the
west
coast
brewing
theories
solidly
a
malty
sugarsweet
spicy
funky
pale
ale
and
then
theres
hops
a
sharp
and
sudden
hop
bittering
hits
in
the
back
of
the
throat
contributing
an
earthy
grassy
flavor
the
presents
itself
primarily
in
the
finish
the
beer
basically
changes
from
and
upfront
belgian
pale
ale
to
a
thinning
ipa
in
the
finish
a
challenge
for
the
senses
and
a
joy
to
drink
i
just
believe
the
sharp
hop
presence
is
a
little
dominating
this
is
quite
nice
i
really
like
the
added
complexity
that
the
belgian
yeast
brings
what
really
helps
this
work
is
that
the
dominant
hop
character
is
a
mix
of
herbal
and
grassy
notes
as
well
as
the
simple
grain
bill
that
was
used
this
is
really
quite
enjoyable
and
i
hope
to
see
more
of
these
belgian
styled
super
hop
beers
the
hops
are
dry
and
citrusy
spicy
and
cleanly
bitter
the
malt
lends
some
balance
i
wish
it
were
hoppier
though
not
to
say
this
isnt
hoppy
on
the
contrary
it
is
nicely
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
awesome
champagnesque
drinkability
is
great
this
is
the
type
of
hoppy
beer
i
like
with
spicy
food
not
the
american
citrusy
iipas
some
will
bemoan
the
fact
that
a
respected
belgian
brewer
has
jumped
on
the
more
hops
bandwagon
that
was
started
by
a
number
of
american
brewers
and
that
is
thankfully
still
going
strong
on
the
contrary
this
beer
adds
to
rather
than
detracts
from
the
legacy
of
brewing
excellence
that
is
belgian
beer
urthel
hopit
is
a
stunning
achievement
that
hop
heads
the
world
over
owe
it
to
themselves
to
try
very
drinkable
and
very
good
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
huge
head
that
has
plenty
of
retention
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
lots
of
citrus
spice
floral
notes
definately
plenty
of
saaz
in
this
one
the
flavor
resembles
the
aroma
well
theres
a
lot
of
citrus
zest
along
with
some
other
spicy
stuff
the
body
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
the
high
alcohol
level
pours
a
solid
straw
color
with
a
chunky
ivory
head
that
falls
very
slowly
to
an
almost
whipped
cream
consistency
over
it
nose
is
interesting
i
get
solid
notes
of
banana
lemon
and
noble
hop
there
is
a
very
solid
sweetness
going
on
in
this
one
and
not
quite
as
much
hop
aroma
as
i
expected
flavor
is
pretty
well
on
with
the
aroma
the
lemony
and
orange
citrus
is
much
stronger
with
a
subdued
banana
ester
over
this
is
a
nice
spicey
and
herbal
noble
hop
with
a
moderate
to
strong
bitter
on
the
finish
that
is
relaly
clean
feel
is
thick
with
a
lighter
to
moderate
carbonation
of
small
bubbles
that
gives
it
a
good
velvety
smoothness
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
id
like
to
see
even
more
hop
character
like
there
was
in
the
thierez
xtra
i
like
the
sweet
lemony
and
orange
flavors
playing
behind
the
hop
and
the
clean
bitterness
on
the
finish
is
really
nice
absolutely
no
hint
of
the
9
5
clean
and
tasty
ill
enjoy
the
second
bottle
i
dont
get
the
web
site
they
have
an
english
section
but
there
is
no
links
or
anything
just
the
main
intro
graphic
drinkability
simply
wonderful
this
is
a
beer
i
could
have
several
of
and
i
am
happy
i
got
to
have
it
on
tap
if
you
ever
see
this
and
are
a
hop
head
its
a
must
buy
after
a
few
average
brews
and
the
odd
disappointment
this
was
more
like
it
the
first
glass
was
good
the
second
was
absolutely
great
and
i
really
took
to
this
one
one
of
my
lbbbf
festival
favorites
glad
that
i
finally
got
to
try
this
super
bitter
belgium
there
arent
that
many
around
and
whilst
it
could
be
hoppier
in
character
this
one
certainly
doesnt
disappoint
well
worth
trying
the
head
throws
off
a
very
nice
aroma
that
is
a
combination
of
sweet
maltssugar
and
flowery
slightly
oily
hops
the
flavor
follows
through
with
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
two
that
makes
this
very
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
some
in
the
group
wished
that
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
to
allow
the
hops
to
shine
through
more
but
i
thought
they
balanced
each
other
nicely
a
very
solid
beer
id
drink
it
again
drinkability
is
good
but
i
am
a
hophead
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
i
am
not
sure
if
belgian
strong
pales
and
imperial
ipas
blend
well
together
interesting
and
worth
a
try
though
the
hops
were
more
in
charge
in
the
taste
with
a
distinct
bitterness
typical
of
continental
european
hops
there
was
also
a
citric
tinge
to
the
bitterness
while
hops
were
the
first
thing
i
detected
the
signature
lemonpepper
zest
of
belgian
yeast
was
just
as
much
a
flavor
driver
the
pale
pilsner
malts
stayed
mostly
dormant
in
the
taste
and
the
9
5
abv
was
hidden
masterfully
body
was
very
light
and
airy
and
it
was
easy
to
imbibe
this
refreshing
brew
what
would
have
been
on
the
ships
rounding
the
cape
of
good
hope
on
the
way
to
bombay
had
there
been
a
belgian
colony
there
a
noble
effort
misguided
and
bizarre
has
its
bright
spots
but
falls
really
flat
for
me
i
ended
up
being
dissappointed
in
this
for
belgium
this
is
hoppy
but
i
expected
their
americanized
label
to
refer
to
an
american
hoppiness
i
know
i
know
go
in
expecting
nothing
and
youll
like
it
more
drinkability
is
good
big
full
flavored
but
light
and
crisp
also
the
9
5
not
noticed
at
all
highly
recommended
pricey
but
well
worth
it
i
would
try
this
beer
again
maybe
next
time
with
some
marscapone
cheese
and
strawberries
9
5
alcohol
fairly
well
masked
i
probably
would
have
guessed
blindfolded
around
7
a
hoppy
belgian
ale
which
pays
homage
to
both
saison
and
strong
belgian
golden
ales
drinkability
quite
drinkable
enjoyed
all
that
i
had
and
will
probably
be
coming
back
to
this
one
in
the
future
she
took
an
ipa
into
a
belgian
ale
and
didnt
keep
many
of
the
belgian
characteristics
pours
a
thick
lacing
a
fairly
thick
lacing
with
a
golden
brown
color
this
bier
is
fairly
clear
with
a
slightly
cloudy
tint
a
very
malty
and
slightly
sweet
smell
to
it
i
can
smell
fresh
hops
in
this
bier
it
also
smells
slightly
of
banana
along
with
a
hoppy
taste
theres
a
malty
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
fruit
scent
it
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
that
is
fairly
rich
smooth
and
more
carbonated
its
definetly
an
original
taste
thats
good
and
different
in
a
few
respects
extremely
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
the
alcohol
content
is
nowhere
noticed
dry
herbal
crisp
and
refreshing
the
addition
of
american
northwest
hops
here
adds
even
more
complexity
very
nice
the
flavor
is
yeasty
semispicy
a
bit
of
maltiness
and
a
nice
hop
flavor
it
is
medium
in
body
and
really
easy
drinking
dry
in
the
finish
and
way
nice
i
really
enjoyable
brew
would
have
liked
to
have
this
one
on
tap
at
monks
nice
the
aroma
is
not
of
an
overly
hoppy
beer
but
a
nice
sweethoney
smell
with
a
definite
reminder
of
the
abv
at
nearly
10
the
taste
is
again
not
as
hoppy
as
the
name
would
suggest
but
very
good
nice
earthy
yeasty
taste
with
a
nice
balance
of
the
alcohol
i
very
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
is
fairly
mild
with
a
light
carbonation
nothing
to
complain
about
but

i
dont
know
if
ill
ever
get
a
chance
to
try
another
unique
bspa
like
this
urthel
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
breweries
and
this
offering
just
blew
me
away
its
not
often
that
a
brewmaster
can
do
something
so
bold
and
have
it
come
off
so
well
great
job
urthel
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
and
age
will
only
mellow
any
hopes
for
lupulin
satisfaction
a
beer
i
really
looked
forward
to
and
was
left
wanting
a
little
morepoured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
headvery
herbal
and
medicinal
aromas
with
some
belgian
yeast
spicieness
more
belgian
than
pacific
northwest
for
sure
flavors
are
really
medicinal
and
spicey
with
an
englishlike
herbalminty
finish
that
lingers
for
awhile
a
supremely
hopped
belgian
ale
it
maybe
but
a
mix
of

spalt
dissapoints
a
lover
of
amarillosimcoeand
cascades
like
me
a
well
made
beer
but
not
a
real
hop
dream
like
i
had
hoped
if
u
like
belgian

and
medicinal
hop
you
will
like

xx
wich
iam
not
a
big
fan
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
lightly
carbonated
brew
with
gentle
yeasty
and
pepper
notes
running
along
the
palate
hazy
sunny
color
thin
white

leaves
copious
amounts
of

aroma
is
bready
spicy
yeasty
and
a
little
hoppy
doesnt
smell
like
an
ipa
though
i
dont
believe
that
was
the
intention
anyways
nice
aroma
this
beer
is
quite
spicy
on
the
palate
and
bitter
too
the
bitterness
is
conveyed
in
a
nice
way
pretty
clean
and
the
spiciness
is
steeped
in
pepper
a
lot
of
those
biscuity
and
doughy
belgianlike
malt
properties
are
evident
and
provide
a
nice
enough
foundation
yeast
gives
off
some
fruitiness
i
believe
in
green
grapes
apple
skin
and
pear
tones
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
mouthfeelcarbonation
is
delicate

is
approaching

great

here
a
hopped
up
belgian
more
and
more
of
these
fuckers
are
showing
up
and
i
like
it
overall
a
very
good
beer
here
wont
replace
say
celebration
as
my
ipa
of
choice
or
la
fin
du
monde
as
my
belgian
pale
of
choice
but
its
still
a
good
combination
of
my
two
favorite
styles
of
beers
a
very
unique
offering
d
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
considering
that
ipas
arent
necessarily
my
favorite
style
i
think
this
one
is
pretty
damn
good
its
a
good
beer
to
have
around
from
time
to
time
but
dont
know
that
id
make
it
a
regular
habit
to
drink
it
50

saaz
like
it
a
damn
lot
maybe
when
i
am
not
in
the
mood
for
something
ultra
complex
from
belgian
land
i
will
pull
for
this
it
reminds
me
of
the
top
belgians
but
i
am
enjoying
this
one
so
much
more
than
some
more
complex
beers
this
could
hold
up
to
a
strong
dessert
or
be
good
to
have
around
the
bbq
versatile
very
tasty
you
can
linger
on
it
or
sip
away
really
good
stuff
beer
is
good
happy
hoppy
beering
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
very
thick
and
dense
white
head
thick
coating
of
lacing
too
the
nose
is
predominantly
yeast
with
some
hops
as
well
the
word
hopit
on
the
label
caught
my
eye
but
there
is
surprisingly
little
hops
flavor
here
yeast
and
spices
dominate
as
well
as
a
good
amount
of
fruit
the
finish
is
somewhat
spicy
with
bitter
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
at
the
end
fairly
enjoyable
overall
d
this
is
a
whole
new
nonstyle
of
beers
it
has
all
the
great
qualities
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
great
juicy
hop
backbone
and
some
nice
subtle
alcohol
to
compliment
it
this
beer
has
all
the
flavors
very
well
blended
but
it
has
lots
of
good
character
a
nicely
drinkable
highly
enjoyable
hoppy
beer
that
many
american
brewers
should
sample
to
help
them
expand
their
hop
portfolios
worth
the
drive
to
minneapolis
to
have
a
well
served
glass
slightly
hazed
darkish
gold
appearance
good
styrofoamlike
rocky
head
of
almost
an
inch
and
of
decent
duration
lots
of
puffy
laces
grip
the
glass
caramel
malt
and
sweet
orange
hops
dominate
the
aroma
mouthfeel
comes
out
as
submedium
carbonation
is
high
and
quite
bubbly
for
its
hops
claims
this
one
leans
on
the
malt
candy
corn
and
some
candi
sugar
aspects
attenuates
with
some
bitterness
in
a
dryly
leafy
manner
a
little
gaseous
at
the
close
not
a
bad
brew
not
particularly
hoppy
or
dry
in
a
lot
of
ways
its
seems
to
be
another
rendition
of
a
duvel
clone
in
the
slightly
too
sweet
manner
thats
more
typical
of
some
north
american
brewers
good
drinkability
its
like
a
triple
and
a
dipa
got
it
on
and
gave
birth
to
this
fine
brew
i
really
like
the
packaging
too
cool
graphics
and
lots
of
info
regarding
the
story
behind
the
beer
and
a
list
of
ingredients
is
always
a
nice
touch
although
i
review
this
from
a
bottle
at
home
i
was
granted
the
rare
treat
of
having
my
first
taste
of
this
fine
beer
in
the
company
of
hildegard
herself
as
well
as
bas
vas
ostern
the
man
behind
the
urthels
and
several
other
fine
folks
as
well
many
thanks
hildegard
keep
on
brewin
or
should
i
say
pache
aroma
is
very
interesting
with
spices
yeast
hops
and
a
bit
of
resin
outstanding
appearance
with
a
huge
billowy
offwhite
semipermanent
head
with
lots
of
lace
and
a
clear
honey
amber
color
flavors
similar
to
nose
with
resin
coming
out
more
and
lingering
somewhat
unpleasantly
in
the
finish
body
is
on
the
soft
side
which
enhances
that
resin
finish
otherwise
its
a
real
good
drinking
beer
really
solid
everyday
beer
best
belgo
ipa
for
me
lovely
honey
color
light
white
foam
smell
heavy
on
bananas
a
bit
of
bubble
gum
but
not
in
cloying
way
its
whats
most
belgian
about
this
belgian
ipa
slight
carbonation
on
front
of
tongue
exceptionally
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
beer
while
still
having
a
personality
nothing
challenging
about
this
ipa
but
be
careful
because
it
does
not
taste
like
a
7
4
abv
i
will
go
back
to
this
beer
and
serve
to
none
beer
lovers
because
of
its
balance
despite
the
fact
i
dont
think
its
especially
interesting
nice
probably
one
of
the
most
grassy
piney
and
earthy
beers
ive
had
wish
the
esters
and
fruity
hops
were
more
prevalent
but
a
nice
beer
in
the
end
the
resiny
earthy
hops
are
too
much
for
my
palate
great
beer
very
fruity
with
a
nice
kick
of
bitter
hops
does
not
taste
like
zombie
dust
as
i
was
told
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
foamy
one
finger
head
nice
citrus
hop
smell
there
is
a
mixing
of
other
fruit
smells
including
orange
the
banana
and
clove
breaks
through
the
citrus
hop
taste
the
banana
taste
lingers
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
the
desired
hop
bite
and
clovebanana
finish
the
hops
burst
back
up
the
nose
slightly
banana
keeps
coming
back
through
this
was
very
good
and
would
put
this
in
the
ball
park
of
gumballhead
head
delicious
combination
of
belgian
yeasty
flavors
fruity
hop
aromas
and
a
clean
medium
bitterness
yummy
best
beer
from
a
brewery
i
have
never
heard
of
i
can
remember
what
a
cool
brew
amber
in
color
light
amber
pale
copper
with
a
tall
lasting
off
white
head
it
smells
way
more
belgian
than
i
usually
like
in
belgian
ipa
with
a
ton
of
fruity
yeast
and
an
almost
white
wine
vibe
the
citra
hops
are
the
kicker
though
they
are
so
well
dosed
and
so
fresh
and
vibrant
that
they
bring
the
yeast
and
the
malt
together
where
it
always
seems
disjointed
in
the
style
to
me
the
citra
is
juicy
lemon
curd
and
pineapple
which
matches
the
esters
in
the
belgian
yeast
as
well
as
the
higher
sugars
in
the
medium
crystal
malt
a
great
tripartite
synergy
here
hops
do
carry
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweet
but
they
are
so
oily
and
big
that
they
keep
the
finish
really
long
its
refreshing
though
with
high
flying
carbonation
this
was
a
huge
surprise
to
me
one
of
those
beers
i
had
no
real
expectations
for
and
it
floored
me
super
well
made
i
am
now
eagerly
seeking
more
beer
from
these
guys
are
they
all
this
good
pretty
fine
brew
just
got
done
with
a
psuedosue
so
get
to
compare
citra
hop
beers
this
ones
good
much
sweeter
from
the
trappist
yeast
dont
like
it
as
much
but
still
a
very
good
solid
beer
dat
deer
be
pissed
yo
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
brassamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
leek
old
grapefruit
rind
clove
light
nutmeg
banana
peel
and
leafy
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
belgianstyle
yeast
and
spices
clashing
with
the
overdone
citra
hops
making
for
appropriately
enough
bedlam
on
my
tongue
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
i
just
could
not
get
into
this
beer
at
all
the
overwrought
citra
hops
would
have
been
bad
enough
but
the
clash
with
the
belgian
characters
just
ran
things
right
off
the
rails
oone
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
out
there
the
citra
hops
definitely
help
out
theres
an
understated
sweetness
that
lends
itself
to
multiple
servings
without
a
sugar
overload
i
generally
like
to
switch
my
drinking
up
but
a
long
evening
with
a
sixpack
of
bedlam
is
perfectly
fine
in
my
book
o
this
beer
blew
me
away
for
the
style
the
only
other
belgian
ipa
ive
had
that
comes
close
is
lagunitas
little
sumpin
wild
if
you
live
in
wisconsin
dont
hesitate
upon
purchasing
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
everything
you
would
want
in
a
belgian
ipa
no
wait
actually
i
think
i
finally
understand
what
the
yeast
tastes
like
from
within
the
package
of
an
ipa
amazingly
now
that
ive
got
the
yeast
figured
out
im
digging
this
brew
all
the
more
or
perhaps
its
just
more
delicious
as
it
warms
very
reminiscent
of
houblon
chouffe
in
that
it
seems
to
taste
like
a
cross
between
an
american
ipa
and
a
belgian
tripel
this
one
lacks
some
of
the
hoppy
components
of
the
dachouffe
beer
sadly
but
is
still
a
fine
beer
very
wellconstructed
and
enjoyable
complex
without
demanding
too
much
pours
a
cloudy
copperorange
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
floral
hops
slight
yeast
spice
alcohol
and
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
ipa
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
hops
floral
hint
of
grass
strong
yeast
spice
and
sweet
malt
overall
good
appearance
aroma
feel
body
and
blend
o
really
solid
drink
it
mouthfeel
is
fairly
viscous
and
chewy
able
to
stand
up
to
the
aroma
and
flavours
in
the
beer
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
one
of
the
better
ipa
styles
ive
enjoye
in
recent
memory
beautifully
constructed
the
ring
and
lace
has
lasted
to
the
final
sips
overall
i
initially
liked
this
one
more
and
as
you
drink
more
it
declines
a
bit
too
much
of
a
grassy
taste
ideally
a
belgian
ipa
that
i
like
should
be
doable
but
it
seems
less
so
everytime
i
drink
one
this
one
ends
up
in
the
upper
end
of
mid
row
poured
bottle
into
a
glass
opening
it
up
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
no
bite
to
speak
of
and
therefore
not
hoppy
or
malty
at
all
very
drinkable
great
for
summer
spring
time
has
that
refreshing
effect
served
cold
as
my
fridge
would
get
it
has
a
neutral
finish
leaving
your
mouth
light
and
refreshed
not
bitten
like
an
ipa
very
easy
to
drink
best
enjoyed
by
date
is
rubbed
out
bought
it
online
from
a
broker
so
im
not
certain
how
old
it
is
but
it
has
a
very
interesting
footprint
kind
of
creamy
kind
of
sugary
sweet
very
interesting
i
want
to
say
popsicle
but
it
really
isnt
there
but
this
is
an
awesome
brew
overall
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
a
very
good
beer
o
super
refreshing
with
juicy
fruity
hops
melding
with
the
yeast
to
create
an
explosion
of
taste
however
i
would
like
this
to
be
a
bit
more
bitter
than
it
is
especially
if
its
an
ipa
of
sorts
othis
beer
surprised
me
and
is
much
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
ive
had
other
beers
from
ale
asylum
but
this
one
easily
beats
them
out
id
buy
a
six
of
this
anytime
ale
asylum
bedlam
45
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
would
definitely
enjoy
this
one
on
a
hot
day
afterthought
really
a
nice
blend
and
a
nice
intro
to
this
style
the
abv
is
well
hidden
in
this
one
for
my
intro
it
was
a
bit
stark
at
first
not
knowing
what
to
expect
but
it
settled
into
a
nice
balance
between
the
hop
and
yeast
profiles
that
became
a
bit
sultry
towards
the
end
overall
i
dont
drink
this
style
too
often
but
id
definitely
say
this
is
a
fine
example
cant
decide
if
you
want
a
hoppy
ipa
or
golden
belgian
go
for
both
with
this
excited
to
try
other
offerings
from
ale
asylum
who
just
hit
shelves
in
il
overall
i
was
quite
surprised
with
this
flew
off
the
shelves
during
the
first
wave
of
its
release
here
in
the
chicagoland
area
and
rightfully
so
overall
i
like
it
again
if
you
like
ipas
but
are
on
the
fence
about
that
belgium
funk
this
is
your
beer
one
of
the
best
and
most
unique
smelling
beers
in
recent
memory
and
i
cant
complain
about
the
taste
overall
this
brew
delivers
quite
a
unique
and
agreeable
flavor
profile
would
definitely
throw
a
couple
of
these
in
my
create
my
own
sixer
again
an
easy
drinking
ale
for
the
hophead
and
the
belgian
nut
both
bitterness
lasts
long
on
the
palate
flavor
consistently
delivers
yum
tasty
as
heck
belongs
with
the
best
of
the
belgian
ipas
thanks
again
duff27
o
its
not
a
pretty
beer
but
the
citra
character
is
great
o
the
full
hops
flavor
has
some
nice
depth
with
good
citra
qualities
and
some
good
sweetness
and
bitterness
balance
pours
a
hazed
peach
color
sporting
a
soapy
white
froth
that
retains
well
and
laces
superbly

of

and
pine

herbal
minty

well

yeast
and

overall
a
fine
american
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
style
very
nice
overall
a
really
good
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
this
really
brings
the
ipa
part
with
lots
of
juicy
hops
but
there
is
enough
belgian
yeast
spice
to
keep
things
interesting
o
nice
balanced
ipa
that
really
highlights
citra
belgian
yeast
lends
a
bit
of
complexity
and
uniqueness
very
easy
drinking
for
such
a
hoppy
ipa
really
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
of
the
taster
i
had
at
the
asylum
this
was
my
favorite
there
is
something
about
the
citra
hop
that
kicks
ass
this
beer
poured
a
nice
coppery
orangish
clear
with
white
head
that
left
a
nice
lace
the
scent
was
a
perfect
blend
of
pine
and
citrus
the
taste
was
like
the
smell
but
had
the
belgium
sugarmalt
twang
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
would
have
gotten
more
of
this
i
like
it
overall
tasty
not
overwhelming
but
not
underwhelming
either
shows
off
the
belgian
yeast
characteristics
well
while
complementing
it
with
a
good
fruity
hoppiness
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
spices
it
definitely
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
evening
on
the
patio
o
aroma
was
its
highlight
had
a
good
grasp
on
style
hops
seemed
to
be
one
dimensional
leaning
strongly
towards
pine
in
aroma
but
even
more
so
taste
great
feel
and
appearance
i
would
recommend
but
not
go
out
of
the
way
to
find
this
was
more
of
a
sipper
othis
is
the
first
belgian
ipa
that
i
can
recall
drinking
ipa
lovers
will
be
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
traditional
hopipa
flavoring
i
may
try
again
this
fall
on
tap
at
the
brewery
but
cant
see
this
as
an
everyday
beer
o
this
belgian
ipa
is
superb
buy
this
one
or
trade
for
it
seriously
this
defines
a
great
smelling
brew
o
just
read
the
quote
from
the
bottle
i
posted
at
the
top
a
fun
beer
to
drink
with
a
very
unique
and
delicious
flavor
ale
asylum
sure
has
great
ipas
they
just
stated
bottling
this
a
little
over
a
week
ago
so
it
is
the
essence
of
fresh
bedlam
baby
no
better
belgian
ipa
out
there
overall
bedlam
is
a
great
example
of
what
a
belgian
ipa
can
and
should
be
i
cant
get
enough
of
that
big
tropicalcitrus
flavor
the
body
is
different
and
more
interesting
then
a
run
of
the
mill
ipa
never
hesitate
to
grab
a
6
of
this
when
i
come
across
it
overall
this
is
ale
asylums
best
offering
it
is
truly
a
shame
that
this
is
not
a
yearround
beer
because
living
in
madison
i
would
love
to
have
this
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
the
trappist
or
more
broadly
belgian
ipa
is
not
something
i
have
had
before
but
i
will
certainly
be
seeking
more
out
after
this
masterpiece
of
brewing
craft
this
is
unquestionably
deserving
of
a
spot
in
my
personal
top
five
beers
and
is
just
a
hair
off
perfection
as
it
is
distributed
only
within
a
very
small
radius
in
wisconsin
look
for
possible
trades
if
you
are
interested
if
ever
there
was
a
beer
that
needed
exposure
it
is
this
jawdropping
trappist
ipa
18
520
this
took
me
entirely
by
surprise
i
got
a
single
and
will
be
seeking
out
more
this
was
definitely
a
pleasant
surprise
as
its
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
tasted
recently
the
taste
didnt
quite
deliver
the
promise
of
the
aroma
but
that
was
a
pretty
serious
promise
4
5
d
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
incredibly
drinkable
hops
do
their
job
and
do
it
well
but
dont
make
the
beer
a
cloying
undrinkable
hop
bomb
that
some
of
the
more
citrus
oriented
ipas
do
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
a
must
try
wow
bedlam
surpassed
my
expectations
with
ease
i
have
no
idea
how
old
it
is
ive
had
it
for
a
week
and
a
half
but
its
very
tasty
as
is
wish
i
had
a
few
more
o
quite
nice
although
i
expected
more
belgian
funk
in
the
taste
notes
excellent
belgian
ipa
citra
hops
work
wonderfully
with
the
belgian
yeast
and
malt
loads
of
fruit
and
very
juicy
on
the
tongue
more
please
poured
this
one
out
with
a
big
of
aggression
the
head
wasnt
too
big
on
this
beer
perhaps
some
of
the
carbonation
has
started
to
fade
with
time
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
sometime
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
very
nice
looking
clear
golden
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
so
nice
the
aromas
of
fresh
fruits
like
pears
peaches
and
some
pineapple
come
together
on
the
nose
with
the
sweet
belgian
yeast
and
the
citra
hope
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
awesome
too
a
brilliant
sweetness
in
the
beginning
that
is
quickly
destroyed
by
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
the
carbonation
is
very
gentle
in
the
beer
it
remains
smooth
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
kicked
ass
appearance
is
an
orange
tone
w
1
finger
of
white
head
this
beer
looks
appealing
excited
to
try
it
its
nose
has
pine
belgian
yeast
orange
and
biscuits
sipping
on
it
it
has
a
taste
of
grapefruit
orange
hops
some
light
spice
as
well
mouthfeel
is
low
key
average
carbonation
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
from
this
small
brewery
out
of
madison
wi
o
excellent
beer
will
have
to
search
more
by
these
guys
out
o
i
dont
quite
know
what
the
hell
this
is
but
i
love
it
not
so
sweet
or
bitter
nothing
overpowering
here
but
very
well
balanced
peachy
yeasty
i
love
it
a
total
surprise
overall
its
like
a
belgian
zombie
dust
but
more
focused
on
the
belgian
part
of
the
beer
and
less
focus
on
the
hops
great
job
ale
asylum
do
highly
drinkable
considering
abv
got
better
as
it
warmed
a
tad
get
this
beer
a
head
and
it
be
great
otherwise
a
very
good
belgian
ipa
hats
off
to
ale
asylum
my
favorite
from
them
so
far
o
overall
this
was
a
tasty
beer
with
nice
citra
hop
notes
still
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
hop
with
this
all
in
all
though
it
is
a
good
beer
this
drinks
so
amazingly
well
i
only
grabbed
two
sixers
of
this
and
am
now
wishing
i
would
have
grabbed
a
case
or
more
overall
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
american
made
belgian
ipa
love
it
cost
10
99
for
a
six
pack
o
very
good
bipa
really
enjoyed
this
one
from
ale
asylum
and
would
get
more
in
the
future
o
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
belgium
qualities
instead
of
almost
straight
ipa
light
to
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
scrubs
the
tongue
dry
without
being
aggressive
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
with
an
interesting
flavor
profile
from
the
citra
hopping
combining
with
the
belgian
yeast
would
buy
this
by
the
case
as
my
every
day
ipa
if
i
had
access
to
it
if
you
are
expecting
some
yeasty
belgian
style
blended
ipa
youll
be
disappointed
if
you
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
bitch
youll
love
it
golden
yellow
body
with
threeeighths
inch
of
retained
white
smooth
soapy
head
lacey
carbonation
bubbles
rising
good
hop
and
yeast
aromas
good
bitternss
with
yeast
very
secondary
good
use
of
citra
hops
buttery
mouthfeel
with
the
citra
edge
good
drinkability
this
is
a
surprisingly
nice
beer
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
citrus
orangesgrapefruitslemon
nose
and
a
great
delicious
hoppy
amber
ale
taste
perfectly
carbonated
and
really
well
done
i
am
thouroughly
impressed
by
something
i
had
never
heard
of
before
i
would
gladly
take
another
one
of
these
in
a
trade
and
i
may
even
seek
them
out
overall
very
good
beer
by
aa
probably
my
favorite
by
them
definitely
worth
a
pick
up
probably
a
bit
better
in
warmer
temps
due
to
the
fruity
undertones
very
robust
and
unique
tasting
beer
overall
this
is
a
strange
beer
as
some
components
came
across
very
strong
and
others
seemed
to
struggle
interesting
and
it
is
worth
trying
if
you
like
belgian
or
ipa
styles
the
description
sounded
great
citra
hops
trappist
yeast
an
ipa
a
unique
twist
on
the
belgoipa
moniker
unfortunately
it
does
not
live
up
to
my
expectations
the
aroma
screams
belgian
with
hints
of
phenols
and
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
such
a
beer
and
the
citra
really
doesnt
shine
through
the
yeast
profile
at
first
sip
it
was
an
unexpected
taste
upon
letting
it
warm
up
and
further
tastes
the
beer
is
palatable
but
not
as
interesting
as
it
could
have
been
ive
had
other
beers
by
ale
asylum
and
they
do
not
disappoint
this
one
leaves
the
drinker
wanting
and
expecting
more
thank
you
ale
asylum
o
mmm
this
beer
was
delicious
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
it
was
the
perfect
pairing
with
my
spicy
nori
sitting
next
to
me
very
much
worth
trying
if
its
available
to
you
overall
good
stuff
not
ridiculously
good
but
good
burnt
orange
and
cloudy
in
the
glass
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
on
time
that
falls
into
a
nice
lace
overripe
grapefruit
in
the
nose
and
some
pepper
and
spice
on
top
of
some
funky
yeasty
smells
as
well
good
but
convoluted
bite
is
fairly
strong
from
the
hops
in
the
initial
taste
thats
followed
by
the
funky
yeasty
spice
citra
hops
in
the
website
description
are
apparent
in
both
more
funk
that
hop
in
the
taste
nice
belgian
ipa
note
how
easy
it
is
to
talk
about
it
like
its
a
singular
style
already
but
the
marriage
of
the
yeast
and
hop
on
this
one
is
not
a
comfortable
pairing
it
seems
to
fight
a
bit
but
just
fine
for
the
six
pack
i
bought
of
it
crisp
earthy
and
citric
ops
throughout
with
sweet
toasted
malts
and
fruity
yeast
all
these
flavors
come
together
yeasty
bitter
and
malty
all
in
one
package
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
receded
fairly
quick
aroma
is
big
mango
frutiness
mixed
with
a
nice
belgian
yeast
character
taste
is
again
very
fruity
with
mango
and
maybe
some
passionfruit
nice
dry
finish
as
is
characteristic
with
belgian
yeast
strains
medium
body
with
a
nice
medium
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
really
well
done
beer
in
the
belgian
ipa
style
my
only
regret
is
that
i
dont
live
in
wisconsin
to
be
able
to
buy
more
of
this
dnot
my
thing
at
all
the
bitterness
is
so
low
key
and
the
feel
is
just
completely
disappointing
im
a
little
disappointed
that
i
bought
citra
hops
to
brew
with
based
off
this
beer
overall
an
interesting
mixture
of
american
hops
and
belgian
malt
characteristics
o
good
for
what
it
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
for
what
it
is
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
what
it
was
o
ive
had
a
lot
of
belgian
ipas
but
none
hit
it
quite
on
the
head
like
ale
asylum
does
all
of
their
beers
are
great
but
bedlam
is
imo
the
best
of
them
all
superb
and
a
musttry
if
you
ever
come
up
to
madison
mouthfeel
it
flows
nicely
on
the
tongue
but
i
wouldnt
mind
it
being
a
little
thicker
so
taste
might
stick
around
longer

insouciantly
d
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
encountered
although
good
ones
have
been
few
and
far
between
id
gladly
pick
up
a
sixpack
of
this
next
time
im
in
wi
ale
asylum
has
a
definite
winner
here
so
i
hope
it
gets
made
more
regularly
in
the
future
overall
this
was
another
surprise
beer
we
knew
nothing
about
this
one
but
were
all
very
happily
surprised
aside
from
the
bccs
it
was
a
highlight
for
the
tasting
i
always
enjoy
belgian
ipas
and
wish
more
people
would
brew
them
o
i
had
it
on
tap
and
then
on
the
way
home
bought
a
case
terrific
beer
that
more
people
need
to
try
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
drinks
much
smaller
than
its
7
5
this
would
be
a
nice
one
to
enjoy
outside
on
a
hot
day
i
dont
usually
care
much
for
belgian
ipas
but
this
one
is
a
winner
in
my
book
o
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
it
is
citrusy
enough
that
many
non
hopheads
would
like
it
yet
it
still
has
enough
hop
flavor
to
cater
to
a
true
hophead
overall
a
really
good
tasting
beer
ill
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
good
beer
worth
trying
overall
a
treat
to
sample
one
of
the
best
ipas
i
have
had
to
date
thanks
again
barry
d
if
i
wasnt
picking
up
the
catty
flavor
from
the
citra
this
would
be
exceptional
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
seek
out
again
definitely
my
favorite
beer
from
ale
asylum
that
ive
tried
surprisingly
under
the
radar
o
extremely
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
was
not
expecting
the
complexity
of
flavors
that
i
was
presented
with
i
love
this
beer
not
sure
of
the
price
point
but
i
will
hit
up
all
my
wi
traders
up
to
get
more
of
this
beer
o
this
was
my
first
belgian
ipa
and
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
it
was
a
very
pleasant
mix
of
two
different
styles
of
beer
this
was
nicely
hopped
up
but
not
too
overbearing
and
still
gave
me
the
typical
malty
flavors
of
a
belgian
ale
round
2
of
bedlam
just
came
out
so
i
thought
i
would
check
it
out
pours
a
golden
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
looks
good
smells
like
spicy
orange
hops
and
the
smell
that
wafts
out
of
the
next
door
neighbors
windows
before
they
throw
on
loud
techno
and
order
pizza
this
represents
a
somewhat
odd
combo
the
orange
from
the
citrus
hops
comes
out
strongly
in
the
taste
but
in
a
grassy
spicy
manner
the
hop
profile
tastes
somewhat
similar
to
surly
furious
though
not
executed
as
well
there
might
be
just
a
touch
of
bready
yeastiness
representing
the
trappist
component
but
if
you
didnt
tell
me
that
was
there
i
am
not
sure
i
would
pick
it
up
it
mostly
comes
out
with
a
flavor
like
a
really
interesting
ipa
with
a
slightly
odd
twist
mouthfeel
is
dead
on
not
too
sweet
or
heavy
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
the
beer
i
get
6
packs
of
when
i
want
to
have
a
few
its
so
cheap
and
has
a
more
interesting
hop
profile
than
many
local
wi
beers
seek
this
out
fresh
dont
settle
for
anything
less
drinkability
this
was
pretty
good
sort
of
like
a
blend
of
a
belgian
ipa
and
a
dipa
there
are
some
more
enjoyable
examples
of
the
style
out
there
drinkability
is
great
excellent
balance
it
leans
a
little
more
american
than
belgian
but
its
got
a
nice
hop
complexity
and
it
is
delicious
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
really
nice
hoppy
character
nicely
balanced
quite
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
hot
thanks
russ
really
nice
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
here
with
some
well
balanced
and
robust
hop
character
that
marries
quite
nicely
with
that
of
the
yeast
an
easy
drinking
big
body
on
this
is
only
the
icing
on
the
cake
this
is
a
winner
from
ale
asylum
but
great
results
cannot
be
secondguessed
and
this
is
by
all
means
and
measures
an
amazing
trip
d
killer
nuances
create
and
exotic
and
deeply
flavorful
profile
in
bedlam
ale
asylum
has
proved
once
again
that
they
know
their
hops
and
know
them
well
its
a
very
good
beer
with
nice
drinkability
notes
this
beer
is
awesome
very
balanced
very
tasty
i
read
an
article
that
said
the
abv
is
7
5
if
so
this
is
extremely
drinkable
honestly
i
wish
i
had
a
case
or
two
of
this
i
could
see
myself
going
through
a
couple
bottles
for
sure
cheers
the
tap
version
of
this
beer
moved
it
into
my
favorite
beer
from
ale
asylum
very
enjoyable
pours
a
nice
cloudy
amber
color
with
good
lacing
that
sticks
pretty
well
down
the
whole
pint
glass
smells
fantastic
with
a
very
heavy
citrus
aroma
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
and
a
bready
aftertaste
but
a
good
balance
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
for
this
brew
it
feels
really
light
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
its
a
tasty
brew
for
sure
and
leaves
your
mouth
a
bit
dry
tempting
you
for
another
sip
another
interesting
extra
from
frankenbrew
pours
from
the
bottle
a
hazy
dark
golden
color
with
some
nice
lingering
offwhite
foam
huge
floral
hop
aroma
along
with
lemons
and
bubblegum
the
belgian
yeast
seems
more
prevalent
on
the
palate
as
the
hops
take
a
little
bit
more
of
a
backseat
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
and
much
hoppier
than
most
i
find
this
one
comparable
to
the
venerable
raging
bitch
with
a
slightly
more
complex
malt
profile
and
more
tempered
phenols
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
good
body
and
carbonation
add
up
to
equal
easy
drinkability
this
is
another
great
brew
from
ale
asylum
and
i
love
it
when
they
bring
the
hops
good
way
to
showcase
the
citra
hops
and
the
trappist
yeast
brings
a
tasty
twist
thanks

i
only
got
a
singe
of
it
damn
d
another
well
done
ale
from
aa
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
though
not
an
upper
tier
ipa
producer
yet
aa
has
two
excellent
ones
with
ballistic
and
now
bedlam
highly
recommended
and
one
that
i
will
buy
on
a
regular
basis
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
about
2
fingers
of
head
smell
citrus
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
yeast
taste
is
citrusy
and
hoppy
with
a
clean
malt
finish
deliciious
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
d
this
was
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
i
want
more
of
i
am
really
surprised
that
a
belgian
ipa
can
taste
so
good
i
will
be
looking
for
this
one
again
if
they
decided
to
make
it
again
first
time
beer
for
this
company
and
i
like
what
i
have
tasted
so
far
ale
asylum
has
been
putting
out
quality
beers
from
the
getgo
and
this
is
likely
my
favorite
yet
i
had
a
growler
two
weeks
ago
and
its
even
better
fresh
an
excellent
belgian
ipa
drinkability
nice
bedlam
its
delicious
hop
forward
yet
due
to
all
the
yeast
qualities
ultimately
well
balanced
leaves
a
fruity
slightly
bitter
flavor
on
the
palate
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
found
the
unique
combination
of
flavors
to
be
quite
delicious
d
a
good
representation
of
the
style
they
have
found
a
nice
balance
between
the
two
which
equals
a
nicely
balanced
brew
this
may
be
a
little
sweet
for
some
but
i
think
it
is
a
solid
offering
from
ale
asylum
d
a
solid
belgian
ipa
a
bit
too
sweet
for
everyday
drinking
but
it
was
definitely
an
enjoyable
treat
really
digging
this
new
offering
from
ale
asylum
well
balanced
supremely
easy
to
drink
while
not
sacrificing
any
flavor
would
like
to
try
on
tap
or
a
bottled
version
coming
soon
bartender
showed
me
the
label
printout
and
see
if
the
mouthfeel
improves
a
bit
beer
had
big
flavors
but
they
were
not
balanced
sweet
fruit
taste
clashed
rather
than
enhance
also
somehow
even
with
the
big
flavor
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
this
one
was
bottled
in
2011
so
maybe
the
age
detracted
toffee
sweetness
confectioners
sugar
pear
green
apple
and
clove
dominate
the
aroma
great
ester
profile
theres
a
hint
of
must
flavor
reveals
tart
crabapple
at
the
base
with
notes
of
peach
leading
into
a
slightly
sweet
toasted
malt
backbone
the
finish
is
peppery
and
a
touch
bitter
perfumey
esters
add
complexity
alcohol
surfaces
in
the
aftertaste
that
tart
character
dominates
a
bit
more
than
id
prefer
and
adding
in
the
booze
makes
it
almost
have
an
acetone
quality
overall
a
very
good
beer
lots
of
good
aromas
and
flavors
and
definitely
showcases
the
spicy
nature
of
belgian
yeast
which
is
a
hallmark
of
this
style
i
would
have
liked
to
see
more
hop
flavor
perhaps
as
opposed
to
the
hops
simply
providing
bitterness
but
the
spicy
and
estery
qualities
of
the
yeast
made
this
an
enjoyable
drink
though
the
fuller
feel
is
definitely
not
belgian
in
character
im
a
fan
and
appreciated
the
creamy
fullness
here
definitely
a
quality
brew
thats
well
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
thanks
again
dad
the
aftertaste
lingers
bitter
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
appropriately
big
brew
that
works
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
delicate
take
on
the
style
but
this
is
brutal
rjt
fine
on
its
own
and
better
consumed
with
a
steak
dinner
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
else
smuttynose
has
sent
to
the
region
overall
perhaps
this
beer
was
better
when
fresh
as
the
hops
could
have
balanced
out
the
other
flavors
at
this
point
however
it
is
unbalanced
and
cloying
true
belgians
even
hoppy
ones
typically
have
more
staying
power
overall
a
decent
beer
not
a
huge
fan
of
smuttynose
big
beer
series
but
they
certainly
captured
the
essence
of
belgian
strong
golden
ale
this
pours
a
cloudy
very
light
copper
color
with
a
medium
head
and
average
retention
lacing
is
pretty
good
the
smell
is
unfortunately
overpowered
by
alcohol
although
when
straining
to
see
past
the
alcohol
i
find
some
nice
fruit
including
cherry
and
berry
and
malt
tastes
and
its
clear
theres
some
yeast
being
used
here
the
taste
suffers
from
a
lack
of
balance
with
the
alcohol
flavor
out
of
control
the
yeast
seems
to
offer
some
nice
flavors
but
the
label
on
the
beer
says
that
it
is
impregnated
with
loads
of
hop
character

gives

a

only
big
knock
on
the
beer
is
that
is
doesnt
need
all
the
alcohol
toning
it
down
and
letting
some
more
hop
character
through
would
improve
it
greatly

i

in

value
i
would
definitely
buy
it
and
session
it

overall
this
definitely
comes
across
more
as
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
than
a
belgianstyle
ale
but
it
is
delicious
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
this
beer
is
ok

could
drink
this
beer
all
night
the
only
complaint
is
that
the
belgian
characters
are
just
whitewashed
by
the
huge
with
the
only
difference
being
the
yeast
supposedly
there
are
some
major
differences
unlike
the
stone
ipa
ipa
being
a
hazy
gold
color
the
calibelgique
cb
is
crystal
clear
the
smell
is
also
drastically
different
the
aroma
is
overwhelmed
by
spicy
belgian
yeast
aromas
with
only
hints
of
the
pine
and
citrus
the
taste
reflects
this
exactly
tastes
like
the
ipa
but
overwhelmed
by
the
flavors
created
by
the
belgian
yeast
overall
an
ok
beer
but
i
definitely
prefer
the
regular
stone
ipa
i
feel
the
belgian
yeast
hinders
the
ipa
flavor
instead
of
improving
it
this
is
a
very
very
good
belgian
ipa
which
happens
to
be
a
style
about
which
i
am
not
particularly
fond
but
this
is
an
excellent
fruity
hopforward
example
i
am
normally
not
the
biggest
fan
of
belgian
style

alesipas

make
an

for

quality

ipa
with
minimal
after
taste
and
full
flavor
overall
started
out
bitter
like
an
ipa
but
then
added
nice
citrus
and
spicy
belgian
yeasty
flavors
smooth
yet
crisp
and
overall
a
good
ipa
what
a
strange
brew
pours
a
gold
with
a
two
finger
head
smells
like
wheat
with
hint
of
citrus
initially
tastes
like
a
belgian
but
then
finishes
almost
with
a
bubblegum
after
taste
so
strange
but
i
like
it
peppery
belgian
yeast
reads
more
like
a
saison
than
an
ipa
though
the
hop
finish
asserts
as
the
latter
confusing
another
great
beer
from
stone
however
the
belgian
ipa
mix
might
not
work
for
some
i
think
its
interesting
but
not
sure
id
have
it
for
more
than
a
novelty
did
not

its

why
go
back
stone
does
amazing
ipas
and
this
is
no
different
the
only
thing
is
with
this
beer
is
that
it
is
very
light
much
like
a
light
ipa
i
didnt
get
that
strong
ipa
kick
while
i
drank
this
one
great
for
someone
whos
just
starting
out
on
ipas
or
for
someone
looking
for
something
light
with
a
little
ipa
taste
good
ipa
probably
my
favorite
ipa
from
stone
judging
by
aroma
and
taste
this
is
stones
standard
ipa
with
belgian
yeast
added
for
a
sweeter
candylike
background
not
as
good
as
other
brews
from
stone
but
still
very
good
and
enjoyable
ive
never
had
a
belgian
ipa
before
i
must
say
it
is
very
different
in
my
opinion
not
saying
its
a
bad
taste
but
not
at
all
what
youd
expect
from
a
usual
ipa
the
hop
smell
is
there
the
taste
is
typical
belgian
flavors
on
the
front
and
hoppy
on
the
back
end
overall
pretty
good
havent
had
many
belgian
ipas
but
flying
dog
raging
bitch
is
what
i
would
recommend
if
you
want
one
for
stone
i
will
stick
to
their
other
great
ipas
if
i
want
some
hops
bitter
grapefruity
peppery
a
little
banana
on
nose
nice
feel
clean
in
my
personal
opinion
this
is
the
one
of
the
worst
beers
that
i
have
ever
tasted
and
i
am
a
hug
stone
brewery
fan
o

this
is
an
alright
ipa
this
is
what
i
called
a
food
pairing
lawn
mower
and
shower
beer
very
sessionable
and
easy
to
throw
back
if
youre
an
absolute
die
hard
fan
of
the
belgian
ipa
style
then
you
might
want
to
seek
this
one
our
otherwise
it
isnt
anything
crazy
special
i
am
big
stone
fan
but
did
not
enjoy
this
mix
which
is
partially
my
preference
against
belgians
but
also
a
striking
metal
flavor
that
limited
my
rating
significantly
great
belgian
beer
frm
cali
the
smell
gets
better
as
it
warms
more
stone
ipalike
and
less
yeasty
its
a
unique
taste
but
i
prefer
stones
more
traditional
beers
overall
great
addition
to
stones

taste
is
balanced
with
mild

yeasty
spice
faint
bubblegum
and
a
bit
of
a
bready
or
biscuity
quality
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
a
nice
twist
on
the
regular
stone
ipa
worth
checking
out
for
fans
of
ipas
and
belgians
the
verdict
pretty
good
well
balanced
between
a
yeasty
belgian
brew
and
an
ipa
its
missing
the
usual
stone
hop
bitterness
overload
nice
brew
for
an
occasional
something
different
taste
bitter
spicy
yeasty

definitely
on
the
belgian
tip
this
hoppedup
ale
brings
a
bitter
tangy
counterpoint
to
the
complex
belgian
yeast
content
a
solid
and
faithful
collision
of
classic
belgian
and
american
ipa
enjoyable
and
one
id
enjoy
again

the

to
it
dont
expect
any
smell
of

in
this
bad
boy
excellent

taste
with
a

finish
the
hops
were
ever

added

a

not

go

all
of
the
components
went

dont

a

color
with
a
moderate
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
tiny
bit
of
sediment
floating
around
smells
fruity
and
hoppy
the
yeast
adds
a
pleasant
note
taste
is
impressive
a
very
flavorful
mix
of
sweet
fruit
citrus
and
rather
bold
hoppyness
it
is
also
slightly
grassy
and
the
sweet
aspect
falls
off
in
the
finish
to
leave
a
satisfying
bite

for

know
this
beer
is

its
not

stone
is
to
be
commended
for
combining
these
diverse
elements
into
one
bottle
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
alltime
that
also
happens
to
be
readily
available
and
relatively
affordable
cant
beat
that
a
great
light
ipa
for
the
price
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
at
nearly
any
supermarket
that
lacks
anything
interesting
or
new
for
me
to
try
overall
a
quiet
drinkable
brew
which
was
very
balanced
a
very
nice
belgian
ipa
that
had
a
great
flavor
profile
and
amazing
nose
quite
tasty
delicious
the
best
belgian
ipa
i
have
tried
it
gets
better
everytime
i
try
it
more
belgian
than
ipa
most
of
the
facets
of
this
brew
lean
towards
belgium
starts
with
a
funky
yeasty
aroma
lightly
hazy
golden
body
and
small
thin
silky
head
taste
brings
on
the
yeast
again
but
the
stone
hops
come
in
to
bite
at
the
end
finish
reminds
me
of
some
french
cheese
interesting
over
all
its
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
be
interested
in
tasting
this
when
it
is
extremely
fresh
i
also
think
it
tastes
better
at
a
slightly
warmer
temperature
like
a
belgian
instead
of
a
ipa
temperature
o
an
interesting
belgian
ipa
great
for
the
price
and
great
if
you
want
something
different
from
most
ipas
especially
with
how
dry
this
is
od
quite
complex
and
drinkable
i
imagine
this
would
be
much
better
fresh
but
its
still
quite
tasty
and
has
a
nice
mix
of
the
belgian
influence
and
ipa
character
this
is
one
ive
been
waiting
to
try
for
a
while
and
it
was
the
wait
well
done
this
will
forever
be
remembered
as
the
beer
i
was
drinking
when
the
winning
usa
goal
went
in
against
ghana
so
forgive
me
if
i
was
a
bit
distracted
from
how
it
tasted
slightly
hoppy
but
not
too
much
some
floral
notes
as
well
some
ipas
will
beat
you
over
the
head
but
not
this
one
another
great
stone
offering
research
leans
toward
belgian
yeast
saisson
styling
and
who
am
i
to
argue
o
outstanding
once
the
yeast
comes
to
the
party
more
white
than
ipa
but
a
great
combo
o
it
comes
down
to
personal
preference
not
a
beer
id
try
again
but
i
can
see
its
charms
with
other
drinkers
drinkability
not
my
favorite
beer
from
stone
but
still
a
great
beer
all
in
all
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
stone
so
far
d
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
its
not
necessarily
flawed
but
is
a
bit
disjointed
with
too
much
going
on
for
my
liking
the
22oz
was
a
bit
of
a
chore
and
i
dont
like
doing
chores
without
some
type
of
reward

who

this

is
not

but
instead
is
focused
on
a
more

nonethless

really
really

times
better
than
this
a
different
beer
dont
expect
a
strongly
hopped
ipa
or
you
will
be
disappointed
dont
take
me
wrong
the
hop
is
definitely
there
but
saves
room
for
the
yeast
one
can
definitely
taste
a
duvel
type
yeast
dry
finish
and
pear
like
flavor
i
really
like
the
chinook
it
gives
a
really
dry
type
of
flavor
similar
to
the
the
apa
by
schlafly
almost
like
sucking
mint
leaves
almost
hairy
in
some
ways
the
dryness
of
the
hop
flavor
and
of
the
body
the
beer
is
well
attenuated
really
complements
the
duvel
yeast
well
a
different
beer
but
that
worked
well
for
me
i
expected
more
of
a
hop
presence
but
im
disappointed
in
a
good
way
this
beer
is
descriptively
complex
and
is
a
must
try
for
hop
heads
and
belgian
lovers
alike
as
a
big
fan
of
belgium
ales
and
an
even
bigger
fan
of
stone
ipas
i
was
very
excited
to
sample
this
hybrid
this
ale
pours
a
gorgeous
golden
color
with
a
thick
long
lasting
white
head
very
european
in
appearance
the
aroma
is
quite
sweet
with
tons
of
belgium
yeast
and
malty
notes
though
there
is
definitely
and
underlying
aroma
of
west
coast
hops
this
one
has
a
lighter
body
than
i
expected
the
flavor
of
this
ale
is
more
european
influenced
than
i
expected
with
a
lot
of
sweet
yeast
flavors
and
malt
yet
there
is
a
definite
american
ipa
influence
a
very
decent
amount
of
hops
that
would
not
be
found
in
a
typical
belgium
ale
this
is
not
my
favorite
stone
offering
or
my
favorite
belgium
ipa
but
it
is
a
very
good
well
crafted
ale
blending
two
of
the
best
styles
if
beer
ever
created
pours
a
beautiful
crystalline
golden
color
smells
fresh
and
grapey
the
beer
is
very
effervescent
and
foams
in
the
mouth
its
almost
a
little
too
distracting
warm
and
bready
like
a
belgian
but
with
a
much
more
pronounced
hops
character
and
i
think
i
taste
more
grapes
in
the
back
ive
been
thinking
about
stones
enjoy
by
series
a
lot
recently
and
in
my
eyes
this
could
have
never
lived
up
to
that
but
its
solid
good
take
on
the
style
that
proves
you
dont
always
need
inyourface
to
get
tasty
othought
would
be
better
the
smell
was
good
but
not
thick
and
fragrant
like
a
belgoipa
should
be
the
two
worlds
of
belgian
brew
ipa
were
mild
in
scents
and
taste
good
for
the
style
but
i
didnt
get
too
excited
drinking
just
sipped
nonchalantly
good
to
slightly
great
beer
but
not
classic
like
a
stone
brew
should
be
o
solid

of
the
style

big

and

are
just
a
wonderful
thing
o
its
been
said
so
many
times
its
almost
not
worth
saying
stone
knows
what
the
hell
they
are
doing
if
you
havent
jumped
on
board
youre
insane
this
was
a
super
complex
super
balanced
beer
im
almost
dumbfounded
by
what
just
happened
happens
pretty
regularly
with
a
stone
brew
overall
fantastic
brew
holds
up
to
stones
standards
very
well
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
how
american
breweries
do
the
style
the
craftsmanship
is
there
this
is
a
style
that
i
love
theres
still
a
few
other
examples
of
the
styles
i
prefer
but
this
is
always
a
nice
experience
when
consumed
fresh
o
a
fabulous
offering
it
is
the
best
of
both
world
american
ipa
and
belgian
goodness
a
really
great
beer
the
hops
and
yeast
compliment
each
other
very
nicely
and
make
for
a
tasty
easy
drinking
yet
complex
beer
it
does
flow
nicely
and
it
has
a
pleasant
soft
smoothness
built
on
a
velvetyfeeling
carbonation
that
also
adds
a
little
crispness
the
body
is
a
good
medium
it
finishes
out
semidry
as
some
alcohol
and
a
little
leaf
edge
in
might
be
worth
a
retaste
a
year
or
so
down
the
line
but
for
now
i
will
probably
not
be
buying
it
again
anytime
soon
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
style
the
bomber
was
almost
a
bit
much
for
my
session
but
i
enjoyed
it
very
pleased
with
this
it
avoids
the
overt
hoppiness
of
other
stone
offerings
o
doesnt
taste
like
most
of
the
other
stone
ipas
must
try
this
beer
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
of
stone
beers
but
it
is
still
very

the
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
belgian
yeast
made
its
presence
known
in
the
aroma
with
hints
of
clove
and
bubblegum
the
taste
was
very
dynamic
you
could
taste
the
stone
ipa
base
with
its
hoppy
profile
and
bitterness
the
belgian
yeast
gave
it
a
subtle
tang
that
boosted
the
flavor
without
being
overwhelming
the
calibelgique
was
a
nice
twist
on
the
stone
ipa
and
one
of
the
best
belgian
style
ipas
i
have
tried
as
the
yeast
was
a
nice
compliment
to
the
beer
rather
than
overpowering
it
this
was
another
well
crafted
brew
from
the
brewers
at
stone
this
is
a
tremendous
ipa
from
stone
its
not
feather
light
but
the
malt
is
soft
and
graceful
the
fruits
are
just
so
many
and
so
splendid
int
he
drink
its
complex
and
its
complex
in
the
finish
not
too
many
beers
can
say
that
smooth
creamy
and
completely
delicious
you
could
drink
this
one
every
day
o
i
would
consider
this
a
perfect
example
of
the
belgian
ipa
category
this
wasnt
that
strong
either
even
though
there
was
enough
alcohol
in
this
to
be
felt
thankfully
this
was
different
than
anything
ive
had
before
while
still
retaining
the
west
coast
hops
and
body
that
one
would
expect
from
a
stone
beer
add
in
an
easygoing
nature
and
a
nice
amount
of
yeast
and
this
beers
a
winner
i
cant
wait
to
go
it
another
go
overall
drinkability
an
excellent

very
refreshing

well

a

beer
similar
to

i

ogreat
stone

for

with

ipa
for

50
would
absolutely
recommend
again
and
again
and
again
ridiculously
good
beer
its
really
in
the
finish
do
the
hops
really
pack
a
wallop
with
a
big
piny
bitterness
the
mouth
feel
is
syrupy
and
full
for
a
beer
of
a
relatively
lower
abv
its
somewhat
warming
after
each
swallow
although
this
is
a
little
unusual
for
a
belgian
ipa
its
complex
which
i
love
and
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
and
purchase
it
again
taste
starts
with
pine
then
moves
to
orange
with
a
bit
of
lemon
and
grapefruit
has
a
nice
bready
finish
with
both
pine
and
orange
and
a
bit
more
of
nondescript
fruit
a
little
funkyyeasty
has
a
light
body
and
high
carbonation
for
an
ipa
although
they
are
probably
both
average
for
a
belgium
this
was
really
interesting
my
sense
is
i
prefer
their
straight
up
ipa
but
its
worth
experiencing
overall
stone
knows
ipas
really
enjoyed
this
o
great
beer
would
recommend
and
will
certainly
have
again
really
enjoy
the
unique
tastes
associated
with
stone
fermenting
their
ipa
wort
with
this
belgian
yeast
strain
makes
for
a
great
warm
weather
brew
one
of
my
favorite
things
about
stone
is
their
abilitywillingness
to
brew
great
beer
for
a
great
price
their
bombers
are
usually
24
less
than
the
majority
of
other
craft
bombers
without
any
compromise
in
quality
the
taste
is
bother
belgian
mellow
with
a
hopped
up
bitterness
what
i
mean
is
that
i
get
the
roasted
pale
malts
nectarine
and
pear
warming
subtle
sweetness
with
a
full
hoppy
and
dry
finale
i
liked
this
hybrid
for
lack
of
a
better
word
it
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
and
unique
ipas
i
have
tried
its
refined
and
im
sure
it
would
appeal
to
people
who
dont
enjoy
beers
with
higher
abvs
medium
body
wet
finish
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
the
best
american
made
bipa
ive
had
to
date
o
what
can
i
say
i
live
this
beer
the
yeast
strain
is
fabulous
and
the
piney
fruity
hops
mix
well
with
the
spiced
earthed
notes
for
the
price
this
will
be
picking
up
many
more
cheers
mf
creamy
at
first
with
a
nice

finish
it
had
a

had

its
a
very
light
in
tast
but
still
has
good
aroma
to
a
little
out
doors
tast
to
it
with
a
belgian
wheet
the
hops
were
a
little
weak
but
still
had
a
little
critus
tang
to
it
no
date
on
the
bottle
which
was
odd
but
for
the

it
wasnt
bad

ive
read
other
reviews
of
this
beer
in
which
folks
declared
themselves
as
belgian
ale
lovers
who
enjoyed
this
ipa
in
spite
of
themselves
and
as
a
hophead
who
doesnt
generally
enjoy
belgians
i
would
describe
this
as
a
belgian
ale
which
i
can
easily
drink
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
either
hops
or
belgian
yeast
oleave
it
to
stone
to
make
the
best
belgian
ipa
theres
a
really
great
balance
between
belgian
yeast
and
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
a
good
beer
a
very
easy
to
drink
good
beer
that
happens
to
pair
nicely
with
almost
anything
else
you
can
put
in
your
mouth
its
a
wonderful
marriage
of
stone
ipa
and
belgianstyle
ipa
its
sweet
hoppy
wild
and
dry
and
im
falling
madly
for
it
quite
drinkably
passes
the
gullet
with
the
greatest
of
ease
each
new
sip
leaves
me
loving
this
and
marveling
at
the
mastery
of
its
creation
mmm
mmm
overall
a
great
rep
of
the
style
if
you
wanted
to
try
a
great
ipa
this
is
the
one
knocking
it
back
a
quarter
of
a
point
here
has
that
imbalance
that
ive
found
in
heavy
seas
loose
cannon
albeit
thats
an
american
ipa
anybody
else
get
me
bros
chime
in
here
onedimensional
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
i
dont
like
the
bottle
was
cheap
so
thats
at
least
one
good
thing
about
it
not
gonna
drink
the
rest
when
will
i
learn
to
stop
taking
advice
from
binnys
employees
admittedly
this
isnt
one
of
my
goto
styles
but
this
one
was
really
wellmade
and
quite
tasty
if
ever
in
the
rare
mood
for
a
belgian
ipa
thisll
be
the
one
i
reach
for
o
a
nicely
done
belgian
ipa
i
love
the
way
the
hops
blend
with
the
yeast
and
just
enough
malty
breadiness
at
the
base
o
great
beer
its
a
unique
hybrid
that
stands
in
a
class
of
its
own
it
has
the
standard
west
coast
ipa
flavor
that
stone
does
damn
well
then
they
throw
in
the
belgian
yeast
that
seriously
puts
this
beer
in
an
awesome
spot
in
my
book
i
think
this
beer
can
appeal
to
both
the
ipa
drinker
and
the
belgian
ale
drinker
im
more
of
a
belgian
guy
myself
and
this
beer
is
super
refreshing
to
me
for
the
warmer
california
months
i
know
and
love
overall
the
merging
of
styles
detracted
rather
than
enhanced
it
for
me
some
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
character
struck
me
as
unpleasant
id
take
a
conventionally
made
stone
ipa
over
this
one
o
i
would
classify
this
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
more
than
an
ipa
because
i
dont
sense
much
hop
aroma
or
flavor
nothing
offensive
about
it
just
not
crazy
about
the
flavors
my
overall
impression
is
that
if
i
didnt
know
what
beer
this
was
i
may
have
been
more
confused
but
the
titles
describes
a
unique
style
well
and
it
is
perfectly
suited
to
be
a
brilliant
stone
product
o
im
not
a
belgian
ipa
guy
this
has
a
lot
of
spice
and
character
in
this
brew
that
im
sure
would
get
some
people
excited
but
its
the
sour
belgian
quality
that
doesnt
sit
right
with
me
not
awful
but
not
my
thing
o
i
was
pleased
with
this
brew
overall
i
am
glad
it
wasnt
as
hoppy
as
some
belgian
ipas
tend
to
be
as
that
is
not
my
favorite
style
the
belgian
aspect
of
it
was
great
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
aroma
of
tonights
calibelgique
i
dare
say
it
had
a
floral
bouquet
scent
about
it
after
tasting
it
a
few
times
drinking
through
the
beautiful
foamy
12
inch
head
id
say
the
floral
aroma
was
true
but
with
a
citrus
twist
to
it
limonorange
hops
were
definitely
in
the
mix
of
flavors
but
not
overwhelmingly
the
only
gig
id
give
it
was
the
lingering
yeast
taste
that
stuck
on
my
palate
which
made
me
take
another
drink
one
after
the
other
overall
a
great
beer
o
its
great
for
a
niche
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
these
every
day
but
i
think
it
might
come
down
to
taste
acquisition
really
unlike
anything
ive
had
before
a
good
example
for
home
brewers
to
see
what
a
big
difference
a
yeast
makes
light
and
golden
in
color
almost
crystal
clear
transparency
and
lots
of
effervescing
bubbles
fine
head
with
some
good
retention
smells
fruity
and
yeasty
with
mild
hops
pineapple
cloves
citrus
and
florals
very
light
flavor
but
surprisingly
well
balanced
a
unique
combination
of
an
ipa
and
belgian
very
well
rounded
beer
lots
of
great
flavors
and
great
if
youre
looking
for
something
new
and
unique
o
very
unique
beer
a
super
yeasty
ipa
hops
take
a
back
seat
role
to
the
yeast
here
nice
overall
o
the
belgian
influence
really
plays
well
off
the
ipa
aspect
of
this
beer
is
nice
to
drink
for
a
change
of
pace
beer
it
takes
some
time
for
the
hops
to
shine
but
when
they
do
it
makes
for
quite
the
beer
you
can
definitely
taste
the
stone
ipa
here
but
its
gone
through
quite
a
pleasant
transformation
a
unique
blend
thats
on
the
lighter
side
refreshing
and
tasty
overall
pretty
solid
ipa
happy
to
have
finally
enjoyed
this
on
draft
more
please
d
o
another
solid
offering
from
stone
a
wellmade
ipa
with
a
unique
twist
o
overall
the
yeast
tempers
the
normal
crisp
and
fresh
stone
ipa
but
also
adds
some
interest
to
the
palate
creating
a
nice
example
of
the
belgian
ipa
style
this
style
seems
to
be
growing
out
here
on
the
west
coast
keeping
the
hop
heads
occupied
while
also
expanding
the
idea
of
what
an
ipa
represents
smooth
texture
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body
this
was
quite
good
stuff
a
definite
bret
yeasty
edge
to
it
and
the
california
hops
came
through
pretty
well
thought
it
worked
quite
well
worth
a
try
o
an
interesting
easy
drinking
belgian
ipa
the
yeast
imparts
a
nice
herbal
spicy
quality
that
blends
well
with
the
malt
and
hops

calibelgique
is
what
you
expect
out
of

co
solid
this
experiment
with
using
belgian
yeast
to
modify
the
classic
stone
ipa
works
well
while
it
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
original
it
is
a
nice
departure
from
the
norm
and
a
worthy
entry
in
stones
lineup
of
yearround
beers
try
it
out
if
youre
like
me
and
a
little
bored
with
the
garden
variety

i
think
youll
enjoy

nice

smells
of
a
strong

and
similar
to
the
regular
stone
ipa
flavor
is
also
nicely
bitter
and
sweet
with
the
hops
i
want
to
say
the
belgian
yeast
makes
this
slightly
less
hoppy
in
taste
and
more
balanced
than
the
regular
version
very
enjoyable
brew
o
this
is
a
hoppy
and
spicy
ipa
and
very
nice
for
this
brewery
the
usual
stone
ipa
traits
with
a
nice
hint
of
belgian
yeast
a
little
spicy
and
phenolic
but
still
lets
the
base
beer
through
very
nice
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
the
belgian
yeast
character
certainly
shines
through
not
overly
ipalike
the
hops
dont
come
across
all
that
well
and
certainly
not
by
stone
standards
impressively
yeasty
aroma
and
flavour
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
to
round
it
off
i
reckon
this
could
have
done
with
a
greater
addition
of
hops
but
it
remains
a
wellcrafted
effort
although
im
not
a
fan
of
belgian
ipas
i
find
this
pretty
good
and
better
than
some
others
that
ive
tried
as
it
achieves
a
degree
of
balance
between
the
yeast
and
hop
notes
in
general
the
style
has
a
muddled
character
that
leaves
you
unsatisfied
worth
trying
even
if
i
probably
wont
pick
one
up
again

gives
you
a
little
of
everything
and
it
all
works
together

16th
anniversary
ipa
before
tasting
this
great
beverage
o
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
has
that
wonderful
tangy
flavor
that
comes
from
the
belgian
yeast
mixed
with
ipas
o
this
is
a
nice
enjoyable
ipa
for
sure
i
wish
the
oily
nature
was
a
bit
subdued
but
otherwise
this
is
fantastic
o
calibelgique
is
a
workmanlike
belgianstyle
ale
that
i
wouldnt
necessarily
peg
as
a
stone
beer
the
hops
are
pretty
toned
down
by
their
standards
and
what
youve
got
here
is
a
reasonably
priced
accessible
entry
for
those
new
to
the
belgian
ipa
style
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
medium
to
mediumlow
carbonation
creating
a
generally
smooth
creamy
and
wellflowing
closes
quite
dry
as
expected
from
the
belgian
yeast
and
abundant
hops
okeep
in
mind
if
you
are
expecting
ruination
or
even
the
regular
stone
ipa
you
will
be
disappointed
as
the
hops
do
not
kick
your
ass
and
drag
you
through
a
ditch
without
comparison
calibelgique
becomes
a
surprisingly
complex
and
incredibly
delicious
beer
o
ok
is
this
really
a
belgian
ipa
because
ill
take
this
any
time
any
day
again
though
i
thought
i
wasnt
thrilled
with
this
style
i
am
thrilled
with
this

the

with

the
flavors
are
very
well

in
a

slightly
dry
mouth
feel
that
makes
this
an
ipa
to
enjoy
when
wanting
something
that
is
different
than
other
ipas
but
still
from
a
reliable
brewery
an
easy
drinking
belgian
ipa
while
i
dont
normally
like
the
stone
belgian
yeast
this
works
well
with
the
hops
provided
and
the
malt
character
o
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
ipas
unique
and
perfectly
balanced
its
an
interesting
tasting
initially
i
thought
i
would
really
dig
this
but
as
i
got
into
it
it
wasnt
as
impressive
as
expected
the
appearance
is
a
beautiful
golden
the
smell
is
a
sweet
malty
yeasty
mix
the
taste
is
hoppy
with
a
fruitty
malty
mix
didnt
quite
get
the
wit
taste
that
ive
heard
about
but
the
ipa
definitely
stood
out
at
the
middle
and
end
of
tasting
it
was
kinda
strange
i
could
drink
this
again
but
will
not
go
out
of
the
way
for
it
since
then
ive
tried
a
couple
others
which
tasted
better
and
more
balanced
still
not
big
on
it
but
make
this
one
look
even
worse
in
hindsight
o
i
do
not
hate
many
beers
i
hated
this
beer
half
was
miserably
drank
with
the
rest
dumped
based
on
some
of
the
other
positive
reviews
i
wonder
if
i
had
a
bad
bottle
i
am
not
willing
to
risk
it
on
this
one
to
try
again
i
love
stone
ipas
and
figured
this
was
a
guaranteed
hit
i
guess
i
was
wrong
color
is
orangegold
the
pearl
white
head
is
huge
with
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
citrus
scents
are
wonderful
but
a
bit
weak
the
taste
is
an
exquisite
blend
of
citrus
tart
grapefruit
and
apple
lemon
and
orange
there
is
also
a
slight
clove
and
banana
flavor
that
is
a
bit
reminiscent
of
a
hefeweizen
this
is
what
makes
it
different
from
the
standard
stone
ipa
both
are
absolutely
delicious
and
among
my
alltime
favorites
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
2
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
a
latticework
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
citrus
zest
herbal
hops
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
of
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hops
up
front
with
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
coming
through
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
citrus
zest
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
flavor
and
high
drinkability
the
only
way
i
can
put
this
beer
is
if
you
mixed
a
stone
ipa
with
a
saison
thats
really
it
its
got
belgian
in
its
feel
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
that
hints
of
spices
with
the
citrusy
hop
bite
of
stones
ipa
and
if
that
sounds
appealing
to
you
go
for
it
but
to
me
its
pretty
much
on
par
with
their
regular
ipa
i
will
say
it
does
hit
the
spot
better
for
the
summer
weather
hence
a
slight
edge
in
its
favor
comparably
served
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
tulip
the
color
is
that
of
a
fresh
apricot
deep
golden
orange
with
a
slight
haze
and
23cm
of
fluffy
head
leaves
a
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
sweet
with
lots
of
fruity
esters
and
the
everpresent
hops
of
all
stone
beers
good
balance
on
the
nose
that
continues
into
the
taste
there
is
the
usual
citrus
hop
profile
of
grapefruit
and
lemons
but
it
blooms
into
a
white
bread
and
estery
sweet
fruit
of
the
belgian
yeast
very
interesting
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
on
carbonation
very
full
with
a
long
bitter
finish
that
reminds
you
that
you
are
drinking
a
stone
overall
this
is
a
quite
tasty
beer
lots
of
sweet
belgian
yeast
and
good
hop
profile
good
beer
a
great
twist
on
stones
famous
american
ipa
i
will
most
certainly
seek
this
one
out
again
this
is
exactly
what
a
belgian
ipa
should
taste
like
all
the
complexities
of
a
belgian
brew
with
an
aggressive
hop
bitterness
a
dry
crisp
finish
and
a
well
balanced
drinkability
overall
this
beer
isnt
exactly
a
classic
but
it
is
close
tasty
and
full
what
else
can
you
ask
for
drink
up
this
bottle
will
not
be
your
last
salud
overall
the
back
of
the
bottle
describes
this
perfectly
that
is
this
is
the
stone
ipa
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
the
malt
and
hop
profile
is
their
ipa
to
a
t
but
that
belgian
yeast
kick
adds
a
whole
nother
layer
of
complexity
its
a
delicious
beer
but
i
think
its
more
interesting
in
the
context
of
experimentation
in
just
how
big
an
influence
a
yeast
strain
can
have
on
the
final
outcome
of
of
a
beer
most
people
tend
to
think
of
the
yeast
as
an
afterthought
i
know
i
have
its
been
hops
this
and
malts
that
this
beer
serves
as
a
flagship
as
to
just
how
important
yeast
can
be
overall
alright
but
a
bit
too
much
of
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
for
me
overall
good
more
on
the
ipa
side
than
the
belgian
imo
from
a
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
is
crystal
clear

some

the

a

tone
smoother
in

than
expected
long
lingering
spicy

finish
overall
its
worthy
of
the
stone
name
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
special
i
will
say
that
it
had
the
stone
feel
to
it
but
i
just
wasnt
into
it
from
the
start
o
i
really
like
this
beer
the
malt
gets
somewhat
lost
in
the
background
but
is
a
good
distraction
from
all
the
ipas
out
there
o
an
ambitious
effort
quite
a
duet
but
for
me
the
belgian
yeast
becomes
too
much
it
rolls
over
the
ipa
a
pint
of
this
once
or
twice
a
year
would
be
enough
for
me
medium
body
with
a
nice
burst
of
high
carbonation
nice
beer
on
a
warm
day
i
really
like
this
at
4
99
a
bottle
its
the
best
deal
around
overall
a
very
solid
belgian
ipa
the
hops
stay
nicely
restrained
allowing
the
belgian
characteristics
to
take
center
stage
another
impressive
beer
from
stone
o
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
belgian
ipa
it
favors
the
belgian
side
of
the
style
but
the
flavors
are
complex
with
just
enough
hop
bite
to
give
it
balance
stone
makes
some
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
will
add
this
one
to
the
list
o
this
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
with
nice
amounts
of
complexity
there
is
a
very
enjoyable
flavorsmell
and
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
of
these
but
it
might
be
a
little
strong
to
be
sessionable
i
found
this
pretty
refreshing
and
will
likely
have
it
again
had
a
typical
hoppy
ipa
taste
with
what
i
call
the
mint
chewing
gum
belgian
yeast
taste
very
very
good
poured
an
amber
with
thick
white
head
which
left
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
nice
floralcitrus
ipa
aroma
nice
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
quite
different
from
say
new
belgiums
belgo
pours
light
golden
and
bright
clear
through
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
hangs
out
the
whole
time
smells
like
belgian
yeast
west
coast
aggressive
hops
and
light
crystal
and
pale
malts
in
equal
proportions
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
fruity
lively
yeast
and
the
hops
which
taste
less
intense
than
they
smell
some
citric
hops
in
here
and
some
fruit
maybe
nelson
sauvin
malt
profile
is
very
light
feel
is
okay
but
not
entirely
well
suited
to
this
beer
the
body
is
light
to
medium
which
i
find
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
carbonation
os
robust
though
and
its
easy
drinking
and
delicious
overall
yet
another
nice
beer
from
stone
overall
an
ipa
that
was
extremely
hoppy
although
it
was
somewhat
offset
by
the
belgian
yeast
making
it
a
smooth
easy
drinkable
brew
o
an
awesome
collaboration
style
the
west
coast
ipa
fermented
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
genius
dry
peppery
and
cant
believe
this
is
6

for
an
abv
a
lovely
example
that
i
would
be
happy
to
belly
up
to
again
and
again
just
so
i
can
pad
the
would
count
from
one
of
my
favourite
chalices
for
tastings
the
schiltz
american
abbey
series
nice
residual
sweetness
balanced
against
aggressive

initial
piney
taste
with
a
sweet

orange
flavor
in

tastes
more
like
a

than
an
ipa
and
is
surprisingly
not
bitter
weird
coming
from
stone
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
spicyness
to
it
that
makes
it
very
refreshing
moderate
carbonation
slight
creaminess
overall
a
great
warm

thirst
quencher
with
a
decent
abv
that
isnt
overwhelming
very
tasty
and
very
refreshing
its
a
shame
its
so
hard
to
get
in
my
area
medium
bodied
with
slightly
above
medium

intense
dry
finish
very
drinkable
o
this
is
a
darn
good
drink
i
get
more
cali
than
belgium
but
thats
ok
find
a
bottle
and
enjoy
half

with
nice

on
a
deep

aroma
is
typical
belgian
stone
yeast
with

mostly
grapefruit
and

is
also
very
citrusy
with
a
tangy
and
bitter
finish
nice
yeast
and
hop
profile
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
stone
for
my
tastes
o
this
is
an
interesting
mash
up
and
i
admire
the
brewers
adventurous
spirit
it
is
enjoyable
once
you
get
beyond
expectations
of
what
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
it
certainly
defies
any
attempt
to
pigeon
hole
it
for
my
taste
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
either
an
ipa
or
a
belgian
ale
there
is
a
bit
of
a
clash
between
the
ipa
level
hops
and
the
belgian
yeast
its
a
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
while
it
was
out
just
not
my
specific
taste

i
tried
this

sooner

not

a

good

calibelgique
screams
class
and

with
its

its
one
anyone
can

get
it
o
i
really
enjoyed
it
not
my
favorite
of
stone
but
their
beers
are
so
fricken
good
this
one
just
isnt
a
standout
among
the
greats
but
still
a
quality
beer
o
great
stuff
here
a
fantasic
american
take
on
a
belgian
take
on
an
ipa
yeah
you
read
that
right
get
a
glass
this
was
really
interesting
and
very
polarizing
id
guess
the
yeast
was
very
americanized
in
that
it
wasnt
very
robust
in
flavor
it
was
mildly
spicy
and
funky
but
i
didnt
get
anything
in
the
middle
of
the
spectrum
this
combined
with
the
typical
stone
in
your
face
hop
profile
made
it
a
beer
of
extremes
the
malt
was
not
the
central
point
although
it
complimented
the
beer
when
necessary
i
like
the
aspects
it
showcased
but
felt
it
was
a
bit
thin
in
the
flavor
profile
leaning
too
much
on
the
extremes
of
taste
and
smell
on
tap
at
stone
prior
to
enjoying
a
fantastic
dinner
the
beer
arrives
a
yellowish
golden
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
creamy
white
head
decent
retention
and
some
lacing
the
nose
is
a
mix
of
orange
fruitiness
together
with
a
granny
smith
sweetness
together
with
the
bubble
gum
yeast
character
a
faint
hint
of
peppery
spices
nice
aroma
the
flavor
follows
suit
citrus
upfront
orange
grapefruit
together
with
some
apple
and
pear
flavors
the
spiciness
found
in
the
nose
follows
though
mellow
medium
bitterness
very
smooth
finishes
with
a
lingering
bubble
gum
fruitiness
nice
lighter
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
dry
overall
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
id
recommend
this
one
was
just
ok
for
me
im
starting
to
get
into
the
belgian
ipa
thing
but
lagunitas
little
sumpin
wild
is
alot
better
maybe
this
bottle
little
old
the
hops
are
not
the
usual
stone
in
your
face
the
bubblegum
flavor
not
as
tasty
here
too
refined
pass
on
this
one
the
off
putting
phenols
and
skunk
in
the
nose
really
sealed
this
beers
fate
in
the
end
however
i
do
not
know
how
much
better
this
drink
would
have
been
with
them
taken
out
of
the
equation
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
with
enough
punch
to
be
interesting
yet
subdued
enough
to
be
easy
flowing
o
this
was
delicious
being
from
ohio
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
different
stone
brews
but
this
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
its
not
much
to
look
at
but
where
its
lacking
in
appearance
they
made
up
for
it
in
taste
and
smell
and
for
6
a
bomber
you
cant
beat
it
highly
recommend
this
brew
and
best
of
all
its
not
all
that
pricey
for
a
bomber
5
99
where
i
live
i
am
very
grateful
for
this
brew
best
enjoyed
with
a
fine
black
throated
wind
from
a
good
year
maybe
74
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
original
appearance
had
me
going
in
with
lower
expectations
but
then
it
impressed
the
rest
of
the
way
this
taste
was
right
up
my
alley
and
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
belgian
ipas
in
the
future
in
my
opinion
a
great
balance
of
west
coast
meets
belgium
overall
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
better
stone
beers
ive
had
and
one
of
the
better
belgian
influenced
ipas
ive
come
across
as
well
still
all
that
hoppy
goodness
that
stone
ipa
delivers
and
the
belgian
yeast
contributes
a
nice
spicy
element
that
works
really
well
quality
stuff
id
definitely
drink
again
recommended
o
man
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
all
around
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
as
i
love
a
good
belgian
ipa
and
this
one
just
felt
so
safe
i
feel
like
stone
could
have
taken
a
few
shots
with
this
one
and
just
didnt
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
o
this
is
a
nice
a
to
a
beer
for
me
i
dont
think
that
i
have
had
a
bad
stone
beer
this
certainly
doesnt
disappoint
i
like
the
creative
approach
to
brewing
that
they
have
expanding
on
their
regular
solid
line
but
not
straying
too
far
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
and
its
even
more
fantastic
fresh
on
tap
the
flavors
are
more
subtle
and
for
someone
who
is
new
to
ipas
like
i
was
back
when
i
had
this
its
a
great
place
to
start
m
great
feel
medium
carbonation
with
a
light
to
medium
body
that
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
brew
o
a
nice
example
of
the
style
nothing
earthshaking
but
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
an
interesting
version
of
stone
ipa
thanks
to
the
belgian
yeast
its
softer
and
mellower
than
the
original
i
may
prefer
belgian
ipas
like
houblon
chouffe
as
those
are
belgian
first
ipa
second
whereas
this
is
ipa
first
belgian
second
but
its
a
good
beer
nonetheless
o
i
reiterate
similar
in
spirit
to
the
belgo
ipa
from
new
belgium
but
certainly
bares
the
marks
of
its
brewery
lacked
the
hoppy
freshness
a
lot
of
other
stone
brews
have
overall
will
focus
on
other
beers
in
the
stone
offering
fyi
this
was
my
wifes
favorite
beer
of
the
bunch
during
the
time
it
took
for
us
to
work
on
this
bottle
of
calibelgie
we
also
had
a
few
customers
inquire
about
our
halffull
glasses
one
guy
was
originally
going
to
buy
bud
light
but
wanted
to
try
something
new
after
just
a
couple
sips
of
the
calibelgie
he
was
converted
there
are
few
things
more
satisfying
than
converting
a
bud
light
drinker
to
serious
craft
beer
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
for
sure
its
hard
to
believe
this
is
the
same
stone
ipa
but
brewed
using
a
belgian
yeast
strain
it
really
does
change
the
taste
quite
a
bit
and
while
i
did
enjoy
it
i
am
still
partial
to
stone
ipa
this
beers
biggest
strengths
were
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
which
were
quite
nice
i
will
certainly
try
this
brew
again
sometime
and
hope
that
i
can
try
other
offerings
that
experiment
with
different
yeast
strains
much
like
this
one
im
not
really
too
super
keen
on
the
beers
that
are
overly
belgian
so
this
one
is
a
nice
balance
for
me
its
really
great
im
new
to
the
belgian
ipa
style
so
i
dont
yet
have
points
of
reference
but
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
phenols
and
esters
really
added
to
what
is
otherwise
the
malt
and
hop
profile
of
stones
ipa
i
looked
through
numerous
reviews
to
see
if
anyone
else
picked
up
on
the
welchs
taste
as
did
i
and
found
none
so
perhaps
it
me
overall
there
was
this
one
odd
taste
to
the
beer
but
it
was
only
subtle
while
ive
had
other
beers
within
this
style
that
were
better
this
one
was
still
above
average
and
quite
drinkable
stone
rarely
disappoints
overall
what
we
found
to
be
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
straight
flavoring
with
echoes
of
the
elements
promised
in
the
nose
there
is
a
great
blend
of
spice
and
yeast
effectively
and
beautifully
mixing
with
the
bittering
hoppy
components
we
would
have
like
to
see
a
stronger
fuller
head
on
top
for
the
style
but
otherwise
this
offering
holds
up
nicely
to
its
competitors
overall
i
really
feel
like
im
trashing
this
beer
unfortunately
however
i
am
being
honest
with
my
impressions
i
feel
like
calibelgique
does
two
things
half
as
well
as
a
beer
that
does
one
thing
pretty
well
kind
of
brings
the
saying
jack
of
all
trades
master
of
none
to
my
mind
perhaps
this
is
simply
a
style
i
am
incapable
of
appreciating
and
ill
likely
revisit
this
one
at
some
point
a
couple
more
times
at
varying
intervals
to
give
it
and
any
changes
my
palate
goes
through
another
shot
an
interesting
twist
on
stones
ipa
very
drinkable
and
worth
checking
out
really
enjoying
this
brew
o
not
surprisingly
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
the
best
of
its
style
that
i
have
tried
but
im
not
crazy
about
belgium
ipas
this
one
is
very
good
and
may
get
again
just
not
over
stones
other
ipas
this
looks
like
a
tasty
beer
it
got
a
dark
gold
body
thats
just
a
little
bit
hazy
medium
carbonation
and
its
topped
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
that
slowly
dissipated
into
a
semithick
covering
and
supported
by
some
decent
lacing
strong
hops
spices
and
citrus
mostly
grapefruit
come
through
in
the
aroma
its
got
a
medium
mouth
feel
and
is
really
crisp
on
the
tongue
over
all
flavor
is
just
a
bit
bitter
spices
are
well
detectable
the
aftertaste
gets
a
little
more
bitter
but
is
just
as
complicated
as
the
taste
itself
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
there
is
a
slight
feel
that
this
could
be
lighter
but
then
seems
a
little
stronger
when
you
let
your
guard
down
this
is
also
pretty
drinkable
and
makes
for
a
great
beer
to
have
at
mid
day
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
belgian
ipa
nice
belgian
notes
mixing
with
fruit
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
glass
of
would
certainly
order
it
again
overall
this
is
a
great
and
very
well
balanced
crossover
ipa
with
belgian
yeast
from
the
folks
at
stone
great
effort
at
a
crossover
style
brew
i
let
the
bottle
warm
some
out
of
the
fridge
then
i
poured
a
large
billowy
frothy
fluffy
offwhite
head
with
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
no
bubble
trails
aroma
is
a
tad
mild
and
with
crackers
bread
dough
yeast
malt
hint
of
hop
flavor
is
like
nose
but
the
hops
leap
to
the
fore
followed
by
sweettang
yeast
bitter
and
other
stuff
body
is
good
but
carbonation
seems
a
shade
flat
finish
is
like
flavor
still
maintains
complete
hop
profile
adds
a
touch
of
banana
and
is
overall
nice
but
not
too
nice
maybe
more
like
engaging
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
high
quality
and
very
enjoyable
belgian
ipa
the
smell
is
very
straightforward
in
that
you
get
exactly
from
the
taste
what
the
aroma
advertises
recommended
for
ipa
or
belgian
beer
fans
o
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
style
this
brew
definitely
succeeds
at
what
it
aimed
to
do
the
problem
with
this
was
that
i
really
dont
a
belgian
yes
this
includes
a
duvel
a
belgian
feels
to
light
for
my
taste
balancing
a
beer
is
nice
but
i
simply
enjoy
stronger
flavors
to
emerge
o
this
was
a
very
interesting
experience
for
me
ultimately
though
i
think
ill
stick
to
normal
ipas
definitely
something
to
check
out
but
not
really
for
me
i
think
theres
two
ways
something
like
this
has
to
be
judged
accuracy
of
style
and
simple
beerasbeer
stones
stated
intention
its
right
on
the
bottle
is
californiameetsbelgium
and
on
that
i
think
they
couldve
used
a
touch
more
west
coast
gfunk
on
beerasbeer
merits
it
still
works
though
i
averaged
the
two
the
accidental
highway
to
hell
tour
continues
this
stop
pours
a
clear
ambertinted
gold
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
creamwhite
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
dank
pine
needles
wet
grass
lime
light
lemon
zest
lightish
toffee
and
pineapple
the
taste
holds
notes
of
nutmeg
clove
black
pepper
rich
toffee
light
pretzel
banana
pineapple
light
pine
resin
in
the
back
and
some
very
light
balsa
even
further
in
the
back
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
silky
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
bipa
one
that
goes
down
way
the
hell
too
easily
palate
the
hops
dominate
the
taste
at
first
but
there
is
a
hint
of
the
yeastyfruity
flavor
of
belgian
styles
i
would
say
that
the
taste
comes
out
as
bitter
with
citrus
aftertaste
it
really
feels
like
i
just
bit
the
tip
off
of
a
douglas
fir
o
i
would
recommend
this
beer
it
is
a
nice
variation
on
the
standard
ipa
4
99
bottle
o
this
is
an
interesting
and
very
solid
beer
if
you
like
ipas
and
you
like
belgian
beers
like
i
do
it
is
a
no
brainer
dry
peppery
and
cant
believe
this
is
6
9
for
an
abv
a
lovely
example
that
i
would
be
happy
to
belly
up
to
again
and
again
just
so
i
can
pad
the
would
count
from
one
of
my
favourite
chalices
for
tastings
the
schiltz
american
abbey
series
nice
residual
sweetness
balanced
against
aggressive
dry
hopping
all
making
for
a
nice
brew
im
gonna
buy
this
again
from
a
different
store
and
give
this
beer
review
another
go
a
very
enjoyable
beer
so
full
of
flavor
its
sipable
without
the
extreme
abv
o
overall
good
beer
typical
piney
bitterness
of
an
ipa
stone
did
a
good
job
of
combining
multiple
styles
to
come
up
with
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
drinkability
theres
no
real
style
or
frame
of
reference
by
which
to
grade
this
they
apparentlycall
it
an
ipa
but
its
not
like
any
ive
had
ill
have
to
simply
rate
it
on
sheer
enjoyment
factor
and
there
it
does
well
poured
in
a
dogfish
head
tulip
glass
pours
a
golden
straw
color
the
smell
lets
you
know
that
this
is
very
much
so
a
stone
ipa
with
a
citrus
and
a
floral
aroma
taste
is
hop
forward
very
similar
to
a
fresh
stone
ipa
but
with
a
fruity
character
from
the
yeast
very
drinkable
the
best
of
both
worlds
california
hops
and
belgian
yeast
o
overall
a
very
clean
and
straightforward
beer
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
much
more
belgian
or
at
least
antistone
than
even
the
spunky
label
could
lead
one
to
believe
calibelgique
goes
a
long
way
to
illustrate
the
effect
of
yeast
on
any
beers
impression
i
e
theres
a
stone
ipa
under
there
but
it
is
ensconced
in
dnarewriting
eurolowlands
mind
shiftiness
bottom
line
still
tasty
but
the
hoppier
bitter
beast
that
you
have
hitherto
known
has
been
coopted
by
a
surprisingly
agreeable
um
i
know
belgian
character
bigend
of
blue
ant
represent
o
this
is
certainly
a
unique
brew
that
helped
open
my
eyes
to
what
a
different
yeast
strain
could
do
to
change
the
flavor
of
a
beer
im
not
acclimated
to
belgian
styles
and
this
was
educational
to
say
the
least
i
enjoyed
to
experience
but
im
not
sure
im
ready
for
funky
beers
at
least
not
any
funkier
than
this
one
the
calibelgique
definitely
lives
up
to
its
name
features
of
a
west
coast
ipa
and
a
belgian
beer
are
both
present
and
blend
together
nicely
if
you
like
both
styles
give
this
one
a
try
another
great
and
distinctive
offering
from
stone
stone
has
done
a
great
job
again
i
like
many
other
people
may
be
partial
on
the
judging
but
i
love
stone
brewing
they
are
one
of
the
only
outside
outstanding
brews
that
we
can
get
in
the
state
of
mt
so
i
but
it
up
when
i
can
ok
heres
the
deal
if
you
are
a
belgian
fan
and
you
also
like
a
good
ipa
you
have
got
to
give
this
a
try
there
are
a
few
hopped
belgians
out
there
now
and
this
is
a
good
one
pours
well
lacy
head
kind
of
a
goldenrod
color
it
starts
like
a
funky
belgian
on
the
tongue
then
the
ipa
character
comes
through
and
the
finish
is
smooth
overall
a
nice
balanced
beer
one
of
my
favorites
because
it
is
very
drinkable
and
unique
overall
if
i
ever
get
a
chance
to
try
this
with
no
yeast
on
the
bottom
or
with
a
best
by
date
i
will
rereview
it
it
still
was
a
very
solid
offering
and
surprisingly
hoppy
and
balanced
overall
this
ipa
took
me
by
surprise
the
fruit
notes
in
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
awesome
this
a
great
all
around
ipa
cheers
pours
a
translucent
peach
blonde
with
creamy
white
fluffy
head
that
sticks
all
over
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dominant
belgian
esters
some
sweeter
fruity
notes
slightly
phenolic
getting
a
little
band
aid
scent
here
the
hops
dont
really
shine
through
like
they
would
in
the
regular
ipa
i
believe
this
is
the
same
beer
but
fermented
with
a
belgian
strain
very
masked
and
hidden
in
the
aroma
slugging
this
thing
down
the
taste
at
first
comes
as
belgian
candi
sugar
very
nice
but
not
too
overpowering
the
sweetness
doesnt
linger
for
too
long
and
a
light
bitterness
follows
through
to
the
finish
bodys
on
the
light
to
medium
side
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
not
sure
how
much
of
a
fan
i
am
of
the
style
im
either
in
a
belgian
mood
or
a
hoppy
mood
so
this
one
doesnt
really
satisfy
either
but
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
overall
a
much
better
experience
than
the
exploding
chouffee
ipa
and
id
recommend
this
to
anybody
wanting
to
try
a
belgian
style
ipa
overall
its
not
bad
but
rather
one
dimensional
not
an
ipa
id
look
to
get
again
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
lightly
hazy
yellowish
gold
color
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
really
and
the
lacing
is
very
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
lots
of
belgian
yeast
aromas
coming
off
of
it
and
plenty
of
hops
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
really
nice
and
soft
feeling
with
some
bubbles
in
there
to
give
it
a
slight
edge
the
hops
go
really
well
in
this
brew
also
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
but
still
had
enough
going
for
it
to
keep
it
alive
overall
this
brew
is
really
nicely
done
big
fan
of
this
one
the
taste
was
good
i
certainly
can
taste
the
belgian
influence
int
his
beer
that
helps
balance
out
the
bitterness
that
we
all
like
to
see
in
an
ipa
i
certainly
can
taste
the
alcohol
kicking
through
and
for
some
it
might
be
a
good
thing
for
me
though
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
it
was
masked
better
overall
this
beer
might
be
my
favorite
offering
from
stone
while
it
falls
more
on
the
american
ipa
side
than
an
actual
belgian
ipa
like
la
chouffe
houblon
its
just
an
amazing
interpretation
of
the
style
as
it
warms
the
belgian
side
opens
up
a
little
more
my
new
favorite
from
stone
world
class
had
the
chance
to
try
this
again
on
tap
at
the
alamo
draft
house
belgian
aspects
were
way
more
prevalent
than
in
the
bottle
and
it
was
beautifully
balanced
between
spicy
tripel
and
hoppy
ipa
this
was
damn
enjoyable
to
drink
all
of
the
qualities
i
picked
up
on
in
my
previous
review
were
there
but
they
were
much
more
harmonious
this
time
around
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
this
style
flavors
are
very
forward
and
well
balanced
o
great
brew
belgian
twist
makes
it
mellower
than
the
og
stone
ipa
maybe
i
even
prefer
it
overall
a
well
done

this
beer
is
about
the
taste
and
smoothness
it
is
nicely
hopped
but
not
overly
so
the
taste
is
strong
but
not
so
much
that
it
hangs
around
on
your
palate
long
after
the
last
sip
is
gone
it
did
not
pour
with
much
head
which
was
unexpected
but
the
extremely
smooth
taste
is
worth
it
im
going
to
pour

give
it
some

6

a

this

very

for
a

o
did
i
just
finish
the
bomber
before
the
review
i
have
been
eagerly
waiting
for
this
beer
to
come
back
around
although
stone
says
its
annual
we
here
only
see
it
toward
the

insert

i
love

i
can
reduce
what
is
clearly
my
longest
review
to
the
following
112
words
hoppytripel
ale
go
get
some
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
color
with
a

aromas
of
lime
peel
orange
and
a
bit
of

some
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
spice
from
the
yeast
a
kind
of
butteriness
on
the
palate
along
with
some
citrus
and
a
really
nice
long
finish
this
ber
is
light
to
medium
bodied
this
beer
went
nicely
with
the
pork
chop
i
had
at
the
brewery
if
you
always
wanted
to
experience
something
like
a
delirium
tremens
but
with
extra
citric
hopping
added
to
it
than
this
is
the
beer
for
you
o
the
beer
has
a
good
balance
between
the
citrus
and
spicy
flavors
and
is
rather
easy
to
drink
because
the
bitterness
isnt
overpowering
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
detectable
pours
a
golden
copper
color
with
a
big
two
finger
frothy
head
which
leaves
gobs
of
lace
up
and
down
the
glass
and
shows
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
candy
yeast
at
the
front
end
a
big
bubble
gum
flavor
followed
by
a
citrus
hop
smell
and
a
slight
piney

the
taste
has
a
big
bubble
gum
candied
yest
presence
sweet
and
inviting
8in
the
middle

you
get
a

balance
out
the
flaovr
a
good

a
very

taste
the

8is

with

overall
a
very
good
beer
nice
aroma
to
invite
you
in
and
a
big
nice
taste
to
keep
you
wanting
more
m
appropriate
to
a
middle
of
the
road
american
ipa
but
a
little
heavy
for
a
belgian
overallexpecting
more
harshness
from
a
stone
ipa
this
is
very
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
great
representation
of
the
style
drink
i
can
say
it
has
probably
been
two
years
since
i
had
this
beer
and
at
the
time
my
palate
couldnt
pick
out
flavors
or
profiles
this
is
very
well
balanced
and
tame
when
it
needs
to
be
the
yeast
and
hops
are
well
tempered
against
eachother
and
make
for
a
slightly
tart
fruity
hoppy
drink
quite
nice
o
i
am
a
huge
ipa
fan
and
this
was
just
what
i
was
looking
for
something
a
bit
different
funky
belgian
yeast
accompanied
by
citrus
hops
make
this
interesting
to
say
the
least
not
world
class
in
my
opinion
but
very
good
this
is
an
excellent
beer
by
an
excellent
brewer
overall
nice
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
wellhopped
and
has
the
best
of
both
worlds
decent
abv
as
well
overall
an
exciting
twist
on
an
ipa
this
is
a
brew
that
someone
who
doesnt
necessarily
like
ipas
could
enjoy
the
tropical
fruit
hop
profile
was
a
welcomed
change
from
the
citrusypiney
hops
that
im
accustomed
to
in
american
ipas
definitely
recommended
poured
a
yellowburnt
orange
with
a
big
amount
of
fluffy
white
head
which
dissipated
quickly
down
to
nothing
but
a
ring
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
orange
and
lemonlime
citrus
with
a
spicyfruity
slightly
sour
belgian
yeast
any
malt
character
is
subdued
by
the
big
yeast
aroma
flavor
is
fruity
orange
and
mango
but
countered
with
a
peppery
spice
of
yeast
malts
are
present
more
now
than
in
the
nose
giving
the
hops
a
carameltoffee
backing
the
spicy
clove
character
dies
down
for
the
finish
leaving
only
fruity
hops
and
a
bitter
bite
yeast
subdues
a
massive
hop
character
which
goes
well
over
a
light
and
creamy
body
no
substantial
notice
of
the
alcohol
in
this
one
drinkable
for
sure
one
of
the
better
experimental
brews
ive
had
and
it
works
overall
very
good
beer
overall
while
i
dont
think
its
as
good
as
stone
ipa
its
still
a
very
good
beer
i
like
what
they
did
here
and
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try

is
pretty
good
nice

with
only
a
slight
head
and
not
much
in
terms
of
lacing
nose
has
plenty
going
on
though
malt
hops
spice
and
citrus
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
grains
annd
spice
with
a
subtly
sweet
note
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
notes
a
great
marriage
of
the
belgian
and
ipa
styles
maintains
a
great
balance
of
flavors
showcasing
both
aspects
but
not
letting
one
trump
the
other
a
noteworthy
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
great
ipa
if
it
didnt
cost
almost
twice
as
much
as
the
regular
stone
ipa
id
get
it
quite
often
very
good
bombers
now
available
at
what
albertsons
pours
slight
hazy
gold
with
white
head
sweet
belgian
aroma
of
spice
banana
and
grapefruit
minimal
bitterness
and
hop
aroma
flavor
is
mainly
belgian
golden
ale
with
nice
citrus
notes
maybe
grapefruit
with
mild
hop
flavor
slight
hop
bitterness
o
if
it
wasnt
for
that
sourness
on
the
back
end
this
would
be
a
goto
as
it
stands
not
quite
right
look
for
the
schneider
hopfen
weissen
if
you
want
a
seamless
melding
of
old
world
and
new
o
surprised
by
this
one
very
refreshing
and
fruity
really
easy
drinkability
and
well
balanced
overall
will
definitely
drink
this
one
again
overall
if
you
like
stones
hoppy
end
beers
i
can
think
of
any
reason
why
you
wont
like
this
one
it
is
a
great
way
to
see
how
a
belgian
yeast
can
alter
the
flavor
of
an
ipa
nice
contrast
to
the
stone
line
of
ipas
o
a
weird
drink
but
a
good
beer
i
dont
think
id
have
it
have
again
because
its
too
oddsour
and
dry
try
it
maybe
i
guess
mouthfeel
is
quite
dry
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
will
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
as
soon
as
possible
o
very
good
pours
a
pretty
gold
and
looks
very
much
like
stone
ipa
an
inch
of
head
and
nice
lacing
i
get
mango
and
bright
citrus
and
pine
on
the
nose
taste
is
spectacularly
bright
and
sticky
as
i
expected
slightly
sweet
on
the
front
with
notes
of
pineapple
mango
and
juniper
as
it
warms
the
maltiness
comes
out
effervescence
is
great
and
the
finish
is
dry
very
drinkable
a
lot
like
stones
regular
ipa
but
a
bit
more
fruity
delicious
and
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
beer
it
has
great
balance
and
incredibly
wellrounded
aroma
and
flavor
i
cant
believe
ive
gone
so
long
without
trying
this
again
overall
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
the
belgian
ipa
i
somewhat
prefer
lagunitas
little
sumpin
wild
over
this
one
d
i
like
it
and
i
might
order
again
and
maybe
order
a
second
i
would
not
buy
a
bottle
again
though
d
imo
very
well
balanced
the
belgin
style
really
comes
out
in
this
one
as
the
name
says
that
it
should
not
my
first
choice
when
it
comes
to
a
beer
or
my
first
choice
when
it
comes
to
stones
beer
but
worthy
of
trying
oi
wouldnt
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
stone
offering
but
i
appreciate
the
effort
d
with
the
lightmedium
body
low
abv
and
the
belgian
funk
stones
cailbelgique
is
very
easy
to
consume
especially
on
those
hot
summer
days
this
beer
is
really
enjoyable
its
interesting
that
stone
uses
the
same
recipe
that
it
does
for
its
ipa
but
just
changes
the
yeast
it
is
amazing
to
tatse
how
much
the
yeast
affects
the
flavour
of
the
final
product
this
is
a
nice
variation
of
a
traditional
aipa

an

calibelgique
is
overall
a
bit
more
cali
in
the
hops
and
flavor
than
belgique
in
the
flavor
and
yeast
but
the
balance
is
admirable
and
overall
accomplished
with
dexterity
not
easy
to
pull
off
stone
has
managed
to
do
so
with
a
fine
combination
of
flavorpacked
hops
and
fine
yeasty
strains
to
yield
a
terrific
accessible
and
smooth
beer
very
well
done
overall
i
enjoyed
this
and
next
time
will
not
wait
a
year
to
drink
it
nice
beer
high
carbonation
and
easily
drinkable
dont
notice
the
abv
this
beer
is
hard
to
beat
fresh
o
i
like
this
beer
it
has
a
different
taste
than
the
usual
ipas
that
im
used
too
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
too
sweet
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
complex
flavors
im
glad
stone
finally
made
their
way
to
missouri
and
ill
definitely
try
this
one
again
poured
a
clear
golden
glow
in
my
glass
with
an
impressive
2
finger
head
smell
is
all
about
the
hops
citrus
and
floral
i
dont
really
smell
the
belgique
part
of
this
one
but
it
still
smells
delicious
the
taste
is
a
first
for
me
very
hop
forward
then
finishes
with
the
the
spicy
belgian
yeast
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
because
it
was
not
like
anything
i
have
had
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
the
good
carbonation
and
overall
very
enjoyable
overall
a
decent
ipa
but
not
really
outstanding
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
regardless
of
style
i
love
dark
porters
and
stouts
and
this
is
anything
but
however
i
also
appreciate
ipas
and
fruit
beers
and
this
satisfies
those
likes
very
very
well
good
stuff
overall
this
is
one
to
convert
people
to
pale
ales
quite
refined
pours
bright
yellowish
orange
with
foamy
offwhite
head
great
head
retention
with
lots
of
fine
carbonation
slightly
hazy
a
definite
floral
aroma
from
the
belgian
yeast
nice
and
estery
but
well
balanced
with
citric
and
grapefruit
hop
notes
not
quite
as
in
your
face
hoppy
as
other
stone
selections
though
the
flavor
is
also
well
balanced
between
a
subtle
but
definite
belgian
yeast
character
and
smooth
citrus
hops
pleasantly
bitter
and
dry
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
the
model
of
what
a
good
belgian
ipa
can
and
should
strive
to
be
overall
a
great
representation
of
the
style
nice
hops
that
mesh
well
with
the
spice
and
belgian
flavor
wasnt
crazy
about
the
aftertaste
but
like
i
said
its
pretty
subtle
and
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
too
much
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
o
good
ipa
overall
but
not
that
complex
not
that
it
should
be
but
the
hops
completely
dominate
and
not
in
a
way
thats
as
good
as
smuttynose
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
stone
once
again
rocks
this
one
finish

22oz

with

tall

that
does
not
last
long
but
nice
lacing
lighter
than
expected
from
a
stone
ipa
oily
and
flat
with
long
astringent
finish
too
flowery
in
the
aroma
with
smell
of
hay
bitter
flowery
taste
to
with
strong
alchohol
pretty
dissapointing
for
a
stone
brew
really
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nice
very
nice
get
two
bottles
o
a
real
treat
to
have
ontap
superior
to
the
bottle
in
every
way
this
is
a
very
good
friday
night
beer
o
a
really
easy
to
drink
very
good
tasting
beer
still
get
tripped
out
by
the
style
when
you
get
the
two
distinct
character
of
two
distinct
styles
becoming
one
o
the
first
belgian
ipa
i
have
tried
and
certainly
good
enough
that
i
will
go
back
for
more
of
this
and
others
of
the
breed
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
belgian
yeast
and
some
lemons
you
can
get
a
lot
of
belgian
character
in
the
aroma
but
you
can
tell
the
base
beer
is
an
ipa
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
notes
as
well
as
some
orange
citrus
and
grassy
hops
low
to
medium
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
the
only
thing
i
dislike
about
the
beer
is
the
carbonation
which
is
very
high
and
prickly
still
a
nice
belgian
ipa
d
a
good
take
on
a
newer
style
the
belgian
yeast
takes
center
stage
yet
somewhat
enhances
the
ipa
characteristics
fairly
well
ive
been
looking
forwards
to
this
brew
for
a
while
anyways
it
pours
a
dark
honeylight
orange
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
frothy
two
finger
that
slowly
recedes
to
leave
a
slim
layer
of
frothy
head
and
lacing
here
and
therethe
smell
is
straight
out
belgian
with
aromas
of
pepperonisalamibready
caramel
malts
and
pungent
floral
hopsit
has
a
nice
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
which
is
well
carbonated
and
makes
for
easy
quaffing
and
suprisingly
on
taste
its
exactly
what
the
label
says
it
is
a
nice
cross
of
belgium
and
us
with
hints
of
bready
belgian
maltspiney
american
hopshungarian
salami
and
nicely
rounded
out
with
a
whole
pine
cone
hoppy
bitterness
and
overall
its
a
pleasure
to
taste
a
brew
like
this
as
fresh
as
it
is
cheers
stone
is
finally
making
waves
in
minnesota
only
took
what
like
8
years
but
its
here
at
last
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
be
quick
to
come
back
to
but
i
love
stone
brewing
and
this
is
a
nice
offering
in
the
style
o
after
a
bomber
of
this
i
have
absolutely
no
complaints
other
than
i
wish
i
had
more
seriously
its
so
laidback
for
its
style
it
almost
doesnt
seem
like
a
stone
brew
but
its
just
as
highclass
as
any
other
beer
in
their
repertories
this
reaffirms
my
high
esteem
for
belgian
ipas
addition
of
belgian
yeast
adds
a
unique
twist
to
a
typically
good
stone
ipa
style
ill
revisit

i
must

my
wife
loved

with
medium

finishes
extremely
dry
and
there
is
a
strong
presence
of
hop
oils
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
o
this
was
an
interesting
adventure
for
me
im
not
really
a
fan
of
i
p
a
s
but
i
can
definitely
appreciate
them
and
this
one
is
perhaps
a
bit
more
up
my
alley
than
some
of
the
other
offerings
ive
had
as
usual
lots
of
hops
but
not
an
overwhelming
amount
and
an
interesting
belgian
yeast
characteristic
which
lends
the
brew
a
unique
characteristic
solid
but
not
exceptional
first
off
i
will
say
that
the
ipa
is
probably
my
least
favorite
style
of
beer
that
being
said
this
one
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
there
is
a
pronounced
hops
flavor
to
this
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
overwhelming
the
other
flavors
help
balance
it
out
making
this
one
of
the
better
ipas
i
have
tried
nice
drink
overall
not
one
to
dive
into
another
but
a
worthwhile
foray
overall
quite
sweet
medicinal
and
generally
mild
hops
take
a
back
seat
to
the
vague
yeasty
funk
this
is
great
great
marriage
of
two
styles
that
seem
like
they
would
clash
yet
they
compliment
each
other
very
well
o
a
very
nice
belgian
ipa
but
not
the
most
interesting
beer
in
this
style
at
all
overall
very
underwhelmed
i
might
revisit
this
one
later
but
after
this
first
impression
i
would
not
recommend
it
not
my
favorite
style
but
an
assertive
hoppy
well
done
belgian
ipa
drinkability
doesnt
jive
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
maybe
stone
should
have
done
more
than
simply
take
their
standard
ipa
and
add
belgian
yeast
more
finesse
and
thought
was
needed
o
this
one
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
with
other
great
choices
from
stone
id
go
for
other
belgian
ales
first
22oz
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
completely
clear
goldendarker
oragne
with
nice
fluffy
white
head
the
head
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
some
pretty
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
right
away
reminds
me
of
a
nice
belgian
style
beer
spicy
fruity
lots
of
yeast
aroma
and
of
course
their
are
hops
there
as
well
mainly
citrus
hops
the
taste
like
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
beer
right
away
but
unlike
the
smell
the
hops
stand
out
more
in
the
taste
citrus
spices
nice
hop
bite
at
the
end
pretty
balanced
not
over
hopped
but
enough
to
give
it
a
nice
bitterness
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
nice
spicy
and
yeasty
taste
in
the
mouth
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
good
pretty
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
good
not
a
high
abv
so
finishing
the
bomber
isnt
a
problem
ill
probably
pick
this
one
up
again
in
the
future
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
its
firmly
carbonated
and
a
bit
light
on
the
mouth
and
the
drinkability
suffers
just
a
little
bit
from
the
belgian
dominance
overall
still
not
my
favourite
style
i
wish
there
was
more
of
a
focus
on
the
ipa
side
of
the
belgian
ipa
equation
o
very
delicious
beer
with
great
cali
hop
notes
another
beer
i
finally
get
to
try
with
stone
in
minnesota
i
know
the
belgian
ipa
style
is
a
little
weird
to
start
with
but
this
beer
didnt
quite
hit
the
mark
with
me
its
like
they
took
a
middleoftheroad
belgian
ale
and
added
more
hops
than
usual
m
d
good
balance
of
sweet
and
dry
hops
and
honey
with
the
yeastiness
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
very
good
all
around
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
easy
drinking
ipa
sweet
mild
yet
nicely
bitter
i
definitely
recommend
you
give
this
a
try
o
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
slight
metallic
taste
and
weak
body
hold
it
back
but
its
still
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
rust
colored
with
a
bonecolored
head
that
leave
very
nice
lacings
it
is
very
clear
and
vibrant
the
aroma
is
an
intriguiging
balance
of
citrus
and
yeast
the
taste
is
drinkable
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
acidic
hops
sourdough
banana
tangerine
notes
a
bright
lively
mouthfeel
with
lively
carbonation
settles
into
a
smooth
and
drinkable
ipa
overall
a
beautiful
looking
good
tasting
belgian
ipa
notes
this
moderate
to
mediumbodied
brew
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
killer
finish
that
rivals
some
of
the
best
flavorful
and
full
of
structure
this
beer
goes
a
long
way
its
one
that
i
will
be
buying
again
multiple
times
a
nice
beer
but
i
am
a
little
let
down
by
the
taste
the
nose
really
hinted
at
greatness
but
the
taste
was
just
a
little
too
bitter
and
not
sweet
enough
to
hold
up

very
nice

very

if
you
told

to

if
you
told

that
this
was
a

also
be

nice
hop
bite
with
some
nice
belgian
spice
and
fruit
its
good
but
by
no
means
is
it
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
like
it
theres
a
good
ipa
in
there
but
it
has
the
belgian
twist
that
spices
things
up
when
an
ipa
seems
too
typical
for
the
occasion
if
you
like
belgians
its
probably
too
bitter
sad
for
you
o
i
was
really
impressed
that
this
is
as
different
from
anything
else
that
i
have
tasted
stone
has
not
disappointed
me
with
a
beer
yet
o
a
tasty
belgian
ipa
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style

mouthfeel

a

nice

bitter
and
a
bit
dry
at
the
finish
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
overwhelming
this
beer
is
well
carbonated
on
the
toongue
upfront
then
finishes
a
little
resiny
nicely
done
pours
a
pale
amber
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
slowly
dissipates
the
nose
is
complex
with
a
characteristic
belgian
phenol
note
but
its
subtly
cut
with
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
a
subtle
hint
of
lighter
fruits
like
apricot
or
mango
the
flavor
is
more
similar
to
an
ipa
than
the
aroma
is
but
there
is
still
a
distinct
belgian
character
to
the
front
of
the
taste
profile
the
flavor
lingers
pleasantly
in
the
back
of
the
throat
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
warm
evening
overall
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
i
really
like
this
ipa
this
is
a
very
wellrounded
ipa
hops
are
very
present
as
with
most
things
stone
puts
out
and
as
would
be
expected
with
an
ipa
but
they
arent
offensive
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
very
good
its
crisp
bite
and
moderate
carbonation
make
it
a
very
good
mealdrinking
beer
i
would
recommend
this
for
anyone
new
to
trying
stone
on
a
hot
summer
louisiana
day
this
went
down
way
too
fast
great
brew
cant
wait
to
try
this
on
draft
a
fun
and
relatively
successful
experiment
but
this
beer
does
too
many
things
simply
well
as
opposed
to
doing

i
was

unimpressed
with
this
beer
although
i
like
many
of

other
offerings
this
seemed
to
fall
quite
short
it
was
too
sour
and
bitter
to
be
overly
drinkable
and
while
i
enjoy
a
hoppy
bitter
beer
these
hops
seemed
to
give
it
more
of

off

on

a

of

styles
its
low
enough
in

but
really
not
something
id
drink
daily
a
nice
change
but
ill
stick
with
one
of
the
other
a
nice
treat
well
done
another
great
drew
form

mf
drinks
a
lot
like

i
think
the
bitterness
in

context
is
off
putting
d

interesting
and
easy
to
drink
go
stone
m
smooth
with
a
mediumlight
body
overall
another
belgian
ipa
another
slight
disappointment
for
myself
i
have
yet
to
be
impressed
with
any
beer
of
this
style
though
this
one
was
one
of
the
better
examples
i
have
tried
bitter
orange
peel
and
earthy
hops
are
pronounced
followed
by
a
surprisingly
suble
yeast
influence
and
a
nice
amount
of
burnt
caramel
overall
its
a
easy
drinker
but
i
have
not
been
overwhelmed
by
its
flavor
there
was
a
faint
chalky
taste
but
i
dont
attribute
that
to
the
beer
easy
to
drink
with
almost
a
saison
feel
to
it
from
a
bomber
into
a
goblet
golden
apple
clear
with
vigorous
precipitating
carbonation
streams
thin
clingy
white
head
nose
of
hops
and
spicy
coriander
with
a
hint
of
mustard
tastes
of
strong
citruspiney
hops
and
coriander
like
a
hoppy
saison
sweetish
malt
with
a
light
bitter
finish
mouth
is
crisp
and
watery
on
the
thin
side
but
quenching
complementary
of
the
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
pretty
smooth
and
tasty
definitely
sessionable
not
easy
to
find
if
you
see
it
and
havent
tried
one
pick
it
up
not
a
good
representative
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
big
white
head
the
smell
is
a
little
hoppy
with
a
sweetness
and
citrus
twang
to
it
hops
seem
subdued
in
the
flavor
as
the
citrus
takes
over
the
middle
contains
a
sour
sensation
right
before
a
very
mild
belgian
yeast
flavor
takes
over
and
finishes
on
a
smooth
note
there
are
better
examples
out
there
very
light
frothy
mouthfeel
is
misleading
to
the
flavor
of
this
beer
definitely
torn
between
the
belgian
styling
whatever
that
means
and
the
hoppiness
that
i
bought
this
beer
for
im
a
fan
of
the
stone
ipa
no
doubt
which
is
what
led
me
to
a
bottle
of
this
from
what
i
understand
that
is
what
provides
the
malt
for
the
calibelg
no
doubt
it
was
enjoyable
very
drinkable
drinkability
very
nice
i
wish
stone
would
produce
this
in
a
sixer
as
i
could
go
for
a
few
more
i
remember
enjoying
this
much
more
previously
perhaps
it
was
mishandled
since
it
was
best
before
42211
overwhelmingly
saltiness
makes
for
a
more
basic
strong
ipa
with
only
minor
yeast
qualities
im
going
to
have
to
search
for
a
fresh
one
on
this
as
it
didnt
compare
to
le
freak
ddrinkable
but
not
one
of
the
best
of
the
night
on
tap
at
the
mellow
here
in
greensboro
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a

mainly
flavors
have
a
slight
medicinal
quality
and
deep

estersa
citric
pine
hop
component
comes
into
a
lingering
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
iam
not
a
fan
of
the
medicinal
yeasty
quality
it
has
to
it
overall
as
much
as
i
hate
the
idea
of
the
belgian
ipa
and
i
really
dont
like
most
belgian
ipas
that
i
try
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
not
one
i
drink
often
because
there
are
invariably
better
beers
on
the
menu
but
this
is
not
bad
at
all
d
once
this
gets
to
the
right
temperature
it
become
very
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
taste
up
really
reminds
me
paler
belgian
beers
and
the
finish
is
something
you
would
expect
from
stone
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
i
really
enjoyed
the
interplay
of
the
two
flavors
definitely
something
i
will
pick
up
more
than
once
d
good
not
my
favorite
stone
the
mishmash
taste
of
fruit
is
overwhelming
d
not
much
to
say
here
this
is
a
good
brew
that
goes
down
fairly
easily
nothing
amazing
not
really
anything
unpleasant
either
pretty
standard
for
a
belgian
style
pale
ale
drinkability
is
good
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
d
its
okay
but
nothing
special
d
a
good
beer
even
if
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
aromataste
not
sure
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
for
a
while
and
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
wasnt
particularly
interested
in
it
but
definitely
one
to
try
d
its
an
interesting
take
on
a
classic
beer
style
very
drinkable
great
beer
was
very
happy
to
find
it
in
one
of
the
local
stores
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
with
plenty
of
body
overall
a
pleasant
and
certainly
hoppy
belgian
style
ale
d
very
enjoyable
beer
i
could
definitely
knock
down
another
one
or
two
bombers
in
a
sitting
nicely
done
from
the
folks
at
stone
they
did
a
hell
of
a
job
blending
the
two
styles
where
neither
one
seems
to
dominate
wow
poured
from
a
bomber
into
my
4
oz
tasting
glass
nice
coppery

with
mild
lacing
and
mild
head
pleanty
of
carbonation
going
on
smell
the
magic
of
hops
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
plentiful
hopaliscious
with
the
piney
citrusy
bonus
i
hoped
for
not
really
getting
too
much
belgique
but
whos
complaining
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
drinkability
is
limited
due
to
the
high
abv
but
will
definitely
seek
out
more
overall
i
was
skeptical
of
this
brew
cuz
ive
only
had
one
belgian
ipa
hybrid
and
i
rememeber
not
caring
for
it
but
leave
it
to
the
people
at
stone
to
do
a
superb
job
if
youre
a
hophead
or
an
ipa
fan
like
myself
i
would
recommend
anyone
to
give
this
one
a
try
d
very
enjoyable
the
addition
of
the
belgian
yeast
provides
a
nice
twist
to
a
typical
ipa
very
very
tasty
brew
here
medium
body
and
carbonation
good
stuff
but
ive
had
better
for
the
style
cellaring
a
bit
perhaps
has
made
the
yeast
fall
awayso
we
get
an
understated
ipa
a
nice
bitterness
lemoney
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
often
just
short
of
astringency
liked
it
though
not
overally
complex
or
extraordinary
ipa
lasting
significant

d
very
easy

drink
light
smooth
and
tasty
it
had
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
and
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
mildly
carbonated
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
very
smooth
there
is
a
middle
of
the
road
bitterness
that
is
a
total
compliment
to
the
flavors
and
never
goes
over
the
top
a
really
nice
beer
but
id
rather
see
it
in
smaller
bottles
frankly
the
22
oz
bottle
gets
boring
to
me
halfway
through
d
at
nearly

heads
and
ius

id
seek
out
in
the

pours
a
medium

with
a
two

that
quickly
goes
away
lots
of
carbonation
happening
in
this
one
the
smell
surprised
me
very
nice
caught
the

then
on
to
grapefruit

passion
fruit
a
nice

smell
of
tart

sweet
i
lose
a
little
of
the

on
the
taste
but
this
is
one
nicely

thats

the

rich
and
complex
a
well

malt
strikes
first
with
classic
belgian
ale
notes
of
coriander
and
banana
but
there
is
an
extra
crisp
element
to
it
it
doesnt
come
across
like
a
classic
ipa
would
but
i
can
definitely
detect
an
element
of
hoppiness
to
go
along
with
it
medium
bodied
coats
the
entire
palate
but
not
in
a
heavy
manner
carbonation
seems
a
bit
low
the
palate
is
very
interesting
it
comes
across
as
more
half
belgian
golden
ale
and
half
ipa
than
does
the
nose
the
hops
stay
with
you
the
entire
way
but
dont
dominate
at
all
they
give
only
a
very
mild
resiny
quality
but
manage
to
be
bright
and
crisp
without
being
overwhelmingly
bitter
you
still
get
enough
coriander
and
malty
sweetness
to
remind
you
of
the
belgian
influence
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
and
smooth
very
drinkable
this
is
a
neat
beer
unique
but
not
overly
impressive
im
not
disappointed
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
o
i
like
that
stone
has
done
something
different
here
i
can
say
with
sincereity
that
i
prefer
their
standard
ipa
though
im
certainly
glad
i
picked
this
up
i
dont
know
if
ill
return
to
this
one
not
overly
frothy
which
im
glad
of
pretty
drinkable
but
it
did
get
slightly
boring
after
a
bit
cheers
d
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
yet
its
still
quite
enjoyable
i
generally
dont
like
ipas
but
i
love
belgian
beers
so
i
was
interested
to
try
this
one
i
found
it
took
the
best
qualities
of
each
to
create
a
truly
unique
beer
if
you
struggle
to
find
ipas
you
enjoy
like
i
do
you
should
give
this
one
a
go
unless
you
hate

mishmash
of
american
and
belgian

that
comes

quite
nicely

hearty
dose
of

quite
fresh
and
fruity
but
also
with
a
defined
clove
and
white

spiciness
a
bit
grassy
as
well
a
very
busy
beer
but
it
works
very
well
goes
down
with
alarming
ease
d
goes
down
easy
and
the
spices
make
you
come
back

a

the
beer
comes
across
as
a

lean

on

it
certainly
doesnt
lack
for
flavor

fairly
soft
and
full
from
the

conditioning
one
assumes
with
a
long
dry
bitterly
hoppy
finish
drinkability
was
pretty
good
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
surprised
by
how
good
this
beer
was
on
cask
i
think
i
probably
enjoyed
this
more
out
of
the

than
i
did

its

market
poured
ontap
at
the
stone
brewery
the
beer
poured
with
a
honeygold
color
with
a
tall
frothy
bright
white
head
the
beer
looked
like
it
had
a
heavy
almost
syrupy
feel
to
it
citrus
belgian
spice
and
resiny
bittersweet
aromas
on
the
nose
the
smell
is
very
vibrant
and
full
the
beer
itself
is
bittersweet
with
heavy
malted
and
spiced
flavors
forming
a
backbone
for
the
dry
pepper
spiced
hops
profiles
the
beer
has
a
sweet
and
sour
balanced
aftertaste
with
some
bitter
hops
giving
the
beer
a
dry
finish
the
beer
is
sweeter
than
most
ipas
and
the
belgian
funk
makes
this
one
difficult
to
drink
lots
of
for
my
personal
tastes
at
least
all
in
all
im
a
definite
fan
of
this
beer
i
love
their
ipa
and
im
a
fan
of
belgians
and
this
marries
the
two
quite
well
the
flavor
strikes
the
tongue
with
its
tart
lemon
notes
but
opens
up
nicely
into
a
floral
bouquet
of
flavors
the
alcohol
is
masked
by
its
heavy
carbonation
and
tartness
overall
it
goes
down
without
an
ounce
of
aggression
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
didnt
know
exactly
what
to
expect
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
it
was
once
a
again
a
great
offering
from
the
fellows
at
stone
d
not
bad
but
id
certainly
drink
more
if
the
belgian
yeast
didnt
have
an
overwhelming
effect
on
the
beer
i
guess
that
was
the
point
of
this
one
though
bomber
no
problem
good
bipa
worthy
of
revisitation
calibelgique
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
massive
rocky
head
that
leaves
stubborn
lacing
all
the
way
down
smell
is
of
belgian
yeast
and
citrusy
hops
taste
is
of
grapefruit
and
lemony
zest
with
a
belgian
yeast
background
mouthfeel
is
fresh
and
crisp
excellent
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
high
almost
too
high
i
could
sip
on
this
masterpiece
till
the
sun
rises
love
stone
d
complex
but
well
executed
belgian
ipa
d
slightly
alcoholic
tasting
considering
only
6
9
thats
a
bummer
for
me
accomplishes
exactly
what
it
sets
out
to
do
combine
the
styles
of
a
belgian
and
west
coast
ipa
hop
profile
is
distinct
on
the
front
and
back
end
while
maintaining
a
palpable
mouthfeel
and
overall
flavor
profile
hides
the
alcohol
extremely
well
one
of
the
more
drinkable
ipas
in
my
opinion
it
seems
that
this
beer
led
stone
in
the
direction
of
brewing
techniques
outside
the
us
saison
du
buff
and
their
14th
anniversary
not
to
mention
their
prospective
brewing
collaboration
with
a
belgian
brewery
while
the
beers
that
followed
were
met
with
much
more
mixed
reviews
i
for
one
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
14th
anniversary
it
is
safe
to
say
that
this
brew
is
approachable
for
all
types
of
bas
d
great
for
the
abv
no
bite
at
all
d
while
beers
of
this
style
are
fairly
plentiful
this
one
from
stone
is
distinguished
by
its
loyalty
to
the
west
coast
ipa
flavor
profile
belgian
yeast
notes
are
incorporated
with
a
practically
seamless
touch
frequently
detectable
but
never
crossing
the
line
to
aggressive
this
beer
also
deserves
a
nod
for
being
of
typical
ipa
strength
unlike
so
many
others
of
the
style
that
end
up
as
less
approachable
double
ipas
d
im
not
the
biggest
stone
fan
in
the
world
but
i
know
a
good
beer
when
i
taste
one
i
appreciate
the
brewerys
disciple
attention
to
detail
in
sticking
to
style
and
for
flat
out
making
a
wonderful
tasting
brew
i
was
disappointed
by
this
not
an
outstanding
effot
from
stone
and
doesnt
compare
well
to
other
bipas
maybe
my
bottle
was
bad
had
this
on
tap
at
the
ruck
in
troy
ny
and
it
was
much
much
better
fresher
pours
a
nice
pale
yellow
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
with
good
retention
that
left
good
lacing
as
it
fell
the
smell
is
nice
and
hoppy
and
there
are
also
citrus
notes
such
as
lemon
and
orange
zest
the
taste
is
a
nice
bitter
citrus
hop
flavor
the
hops
are
the
star
of
the
show
but
it
is
nicely
balanced
the
taste
of
this
is
really
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
has
a
medium
body
with
very
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
really
easy
and
it
also
feels
a
bit
creamy
drinkablility
is
good
as
well
these
are
very
easy
to
drink
they
go
down
smooth
and
leave
you
wanting
more
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
good
job
stone
cheers
overall
this
wasnt
the
best
stone
offering
that
i
have
tried
i
like
belgian
ipas
but
this
one
seemed
alright
nothing
really
special
which
caught
me
off
guard
for
a
stone
cant
say
it
was
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
get
this
one
again
amber
with
golden
highlights
lively
carbonation
and
solid
one
finger
head
smells
like
belgium
yeast
and
fruity
hops
taste
of
tangerine
grapefruit
hops
and
carmel
bitter
finish
doesnt
taste
bad
but
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
from
this
beer
its
like
the
beer
doesnt
know
what
it
wants
to
be
this
is
a
nice
drinking
ale
i
like
the
calibelgiqueness
of
it
d
one
of
the
if
not
the
best
belgian
ipa
i
have
tried
which
isnt
saying
much
since
i
havent
had
many
still
i
dont
think
this
style
is
prevalent
in
belgium
as
much
as
it
is
here
american
beer
drinkers
love
their
hops
in
any
style
of
beer
still
this
one
is
the
most
easily
drinkable
and
balanced
one
of
this
particular
style
that
ive
had
very
nice
malty
aroma
to
it
about
a
one
finger
head
very
surprised
at
the
carbonation
when
i
first
poured
it
when
i
tasted
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
was
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
but
then
kicked
right
in
with
the
hops
and
left
a
nice
fresh
hoppy
after
taste
bottom
line
loved
it
stone
does
not
disappoint
a
belgian
ipa
with
a
stones
twist
making
it
hoppy
as
all
hell
but
while
having
that
belgian
taste
most
people
familiar
with
belgians
will
recognize
smell
is
sweet
with
a
finish
of
hopp
pours
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
and
tastes
really
hoppy
this
is
one
of
their
better
brews
d
this
is
a
good
one
when
done
properly
i
really
can
enjoy
a
good
belgian
ipa
and
this
one
is
done
properly
as
youd
expect
from
stone
very
good
beer
felt
medium
well
carbonated
with
a
creamy
finish
bit
of
a
pine
taste
after
swallowing
very
tasty
beer
d
great
all
around
stone
brew
a
nice
version
of
west
coast
ipa
and
belgian
influences
i
find
this
flavorful
brew
to
be
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
bipa
and
deep
earthy
flavors
are
welcoming
d
really
solid
belgaipa
excellent
fresh
ill
have
to
get
my
hands
on
it
while
its
still
fresh
as
it
is
overall
i
absolutly
love
this
beer
and
it
is
my
mission
to
spread
its
wonder
to
all
the
aroma
is
mild
with
some
upfront
floral
hops
and
belgian
yeast
character
the
flavor
is
a
nice
merger
of
styles
the
bitter
and
floral
hop
flavor
is
strong
and
leads
the
flavor
but
it
gives
way
smoothly
to
a
slight
malt
flavor
and
clean
belgian
yeast
a
little
bit
of
green
apple
tartness
shows
up
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
dry
crisp
and
clean
very
balanced
and
drinkable
drinkability
oh
stone
why
are
you
so
drinkable
4
hops
and
citrus
start
it
off
and
it
ends
with
a
nice
bitterness
i
have
and
hope
an
inkling
this
bottle
may
be
infected
or
lightstruck
as
this
beer
is
just
a
complete
disaster
almost
undrinkable
due
to
the
flavor
imbalance
i
cant
see
drinking
too
many
of
these
either
its
just
too
thick
and
the
taste
is
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
force
you
back
to
the
glass
for
another
sip
over
and
over
again
overall
great
beer
expensive
though
worth
a
try
prolly
not
with
the
price
though
when
you
can
just
get
stones
normal
ipa
this
was
a
good
belgian
ipa
with
good
balanced
flavor
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
that
looks
marvelous
in
a
glass
and
is
an
complex
melange
of
flavors
that
keeps
the
whole
bomber
an
interesting
experience
d
very
pleasant
modest
abv
and
good
for
any
occasion
this
is
a
fine
brew
a
complex
combination
of
sweet
and
bitter
that
just
sings
to
the
mouth
and
the
spirit
of
beer
highly
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
get
it
if
you
can
hopheads
to
expand
your
appreciation
of
what
uninhibited
yeast
can
do
to
hoppy
bitterness
taste
wow
this
is
a
perfect
blend
of
ipa
and
belgian
ale
i
have
no
idea
how
they
did
it
the
fruitspice
is
up
front
with
the
hops
kicking
in
later
stone
youve
done
it
again
i
will
definitely
be
trying
this
again
soon
pours
a
very
hazy
yellowish
color
with
some
orange
tinged
and
a
big
foamy
3
finger
head
with
the
best
lacing
aroma
is
big
time
piney
grapefruit
with
fruity
esters
coming
through
has
a
floral
component
that
keeps
this
fresh
and
very
lemony
big
lemon
pone
flavors
with
a
fruity
belgian
ester
that
is
nice
balanced
malts
but
hop
forward
with
some
citrus
freshness
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
although
you
know
its
got
great
carbonation
really
this
is
a
great
food
pairing
beer
its
got
a
freshness
that
plays
well
with
lots
of
fish
and
chicken
dishes
this
beer
is
quite
good
though
not
as
good
as
other
belgianipas
ive
had
chouffe
i
would
drink
this
again
d
i
like
this
beer
the
more
i
drink
it
although
i
would
tire
of
it
after
two
bottles
or
so
a
great
ipa
excellent
drinkability
especially
for
a
hot
summer
day
absolutely
made
my
list
to
try
again
very
crisp
medium
bodied
very
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
slight
hint
of
orange
i
had
a
finger
of
very
light
tan
head
after
a
fairly
relaxed
pour
the
hops
smell
stood
out
more
when
i
smelled
it
in
the
bottle
once
in
the
glass
the
hops
took
a
backseat
to
funky
banana
caramel
bubblegum
and
clove
the
hops
come
across
as
a
fruity
mangopineapple
like
aroma
theres
a
hint
of
funky
earthiness
in
the
taste
that
reminds
me
of
a
saison
pepper
notes
make
there
presence
known
as
well
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
there
is
a
grassy
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
hangs
on
a
little
too
long
this
is
pretty
good
but
as
far
as
this
style
goes
i
have
a
mancrush
on
raging
bitch
drinkability
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
might
make
a
good
session
beer
but
would
likely
fatigue
the
tastebuds
after
a
while
drinkability
very
drinkable
split
the
22
oz
bomber
but
could
have
easily
enjoyed
the
entire
bottle
myself
my
friend
showed
up
with
a
fresh
growler
from
stone
poured
a
yellow
amber
color
with
white
head
i
hadnt
had
this
beer
in
a
while
but
the
smell
took
me
right
back
strong
earthy
and
floral
hop
aromas
taste
the
same
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
and
a
good
dose
of
fruitcitrus
good
mouthfeel
any
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
this
i
enjoy
this
one
over
raging
bitch
anyday
ill
usually
buy
this
whenever
i
can
good
shit
drinkability
pretty
tasty
and
it
has
some
refreshing
character
i
would
have
this
again
a
would
buy
again
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
good
sized
white
head
nice
strong
lacing
at
first
smell
i
pick
up
a
ton
of
hops
but
after
while
they
become
overpowered
by
the
belgian
yeast
once
i
pull
away
and
go
back
to
it
i
get
a
blend
of
both
its
citrusy
and
piney
almost
like
someone
poured
a
tripel
into
an
ipa
the
taste
is
vastly
different
from
the
smell
its
unlike
anything
ive
had
at
first
im
a
little
confused
then
strong
grapefruit
breaks
through
and
an
almost
grassy
undertone
mouthfeel
is
much
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
or
wanted
its
also
a
little
flatter
than
i
would
have
liked
as
well
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
a
different
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
only
my
second
in
the
style
and
has
me
intrigued
enough
to
try
others
but
i
dont
know
how
much
ill
be
going
back
to
this
one
overall
this
is
a
miss
for
me
perhaps
freshness
was
an
issue
given
the
sensitivity
of
highly
hopped
beers
maybe
this
is
a
world
class
example
of
the
style
or
maybe
it
just
isnt
for
me
a
wellconstructed
beer
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
really
enjoyed
the
stone
creativity
here
dangerously
drinkable
highly
recommend
available
here
in
tx
rotation
this
will
make
the
hop
rotation
for
sure
ry
d
wow
i
almost
forgot
how
much
i
love
stones
creativity
i
had
no
problem
drinking
the
entire
22oz
bottle
by
itself
needs
no
food
shines
on
its
own
an
american
distinctly
pours
clear
with
a
yelloworange
hue
and
a
head
of
two
fingers
american
foam
not
tight
not
much
lace
either
nose
of
belgian
sugar
and
pineapple
palate
of
something
along
those
lines
but
the
sugar
has
a
plastic
resin
quality
with
the
hops
grit
hush
quality
and
apricot
hoppy
but
muted
by
a
abnormal
sweet
that
doesnt
add
but
disorients
the
palate
i
love
this
style
i
am
sympathizing
that
maybe
the
bottle
was
infected
but
it
was
complete
average
worst
stone
ive
had
d
another
solid
ipa
by
stone
this
was
a
good
idea
with
even
better
execution
if
i
could
get
stone
on
a
regular
basis
this
one
would
be
a
constant
in
my
fridge
pours

the
mf
is

with
the
plentiful

mixing
well
this
is
another
great
beer
from
stone
decent
beer
though
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
influence
from
belgian
yeast
nice
golden
color
with
a
creamy

good
spiderweb

steady
flow
of

bubbles
coming
off
the
bottom
smell
is
an
interesting
mix
of
citrus
and
spice
the
pepper
comes
through
strongly
taste
follows
the
smell
the
pepper
spice
is
the
most
prominent
but
there
somehow
remains
a
citrus
backbone
good
full
body
another
strong
brew
from
stone
they
never
dissapoint
decent
brew
for
a
belgian
style
ipa
nothing
spectacular
but
typical
high
quality
from
stone
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
wonderful
rocky
off
white
head
and
had
a
beautiful
copper
amber
color
smell
was
grassy
and
herbal
hops
with
a
funky
earthy
fruity
belgian
yeast
taste
is
very
unique
definatey
not
your
typical
stone
ipa
but
there
is
an
amazing
balance
of
hops
with
the
belgian
yeast
very
different
and
unique
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvety
very
much
like
a
belgian
saison
this
is
a
very
nice
and
smooth
beer
very
drinkable
i
thought
it
seemed
somewhat
close
to
the
stonevictorydogfish
head
collaboration
saison
du
buff
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
and
a
very
wellbalanced
ipa
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
brewed
by
stone
i
would
have
guessed
that
it
had
come
from
a
belgian
brewer
yet
another
very
good
beer
from
stone
pours
a
pale
golden
colour
with
a
finger
of
white
head
and
some
lacing
smells
of
lots
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
with
some
amount
of
the
belgian
yeast
there
is
less
of
a
belgian
type
flavour
to
this
one
as
other
belgian
ipas
more
of
regular
ipa
to
my
taste
carbonation
level
is
good
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
drank
on
22oz
bottle
as
i
wrote
this
review
and
could
definitely
go
for
another
d
the
abv
makes
this
one
sessionable
i
was
able
to
enjoy
a
pint
and
could
of
had
more
but
wanted
to
try
something
else
i
love
the
hops
in
this
one
expected
from
stone
the
flavors
lean
more
towards
the
ipa
side
but
the
belgian
style
is
not
absent
in
this
beer
d
very
drinkable
but
at
6
9
abv
not
too
dangerous
i
split
a
bomber
with
my
girlfriend
but
could
have
easily
killed
the
22oz
by
myself
a
wonderful
melding
of
the
best
of
stone
and
the
best
of
belgium
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
light
but
flavorful
and
very
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
great
balance
between
its
sweet
belgian
side
and
its
bitter
west
coast
ipa
side
the
body
could
have
been
a
little
more
substantial
but
this
takes
little
away
from
the
beer
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
with
this
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
thanx
dk
poured
into
a
st
bernadus
gobletclear
honey
colored
pour
with
a
foamy
ivory
head
that
leaves
significant
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
interesting
earthy
some
belgian
yeast
character
spicy
hops
grapefruit
rind
nice
bitter
sweet
flavors
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
caramel
grapefruit
and
pine
fruity
bitter
finish
active
carbonation
delicious
beer
drinks
very
well
but
that
aftertaste
will
be
expressed
in
the
mouthfeel
rather
than
the
taste
since
it
is
the
feel
in
the
mouth
after
the
quaff
that
i
dont
appreciate
but
i
do
return
for
another
taste
willing
to
suffer
the
pith
in
order
to
once
again
experience
the
melody
of
this
brew
d
while
i
like
this
beer
its
not
something
i
want
to
have
very
often
one
of
these
a
month
would
be
plenty
it
has
a
aroma
of
a
typical
belgium
ale
it
has
the
scent
of
banana
and
bubble
gum
the
taste
has
a
good
flowerily
hop
taste
and
luckily
the
belgium
yeast
does
not
completely
carry
through
into
the
taste
overall
a
cool
variation
on
the
american
ipa
d
i
love
ipas
and
i
like
belgian
trippels
however
i
cannot
explain
my
discontent
for
blending
the
two
i
find
them
not
enjoyable
at
all
d
i
found
this
to
a
rather
enjoyable
ipa
for
someone
who
doesnt
necessarily
like
ipas
in
the
end
this
beer
is
what
it
isa
hopforward
beer
but
the
addition
of
belgian
yeast
has
given
it
an
additional
element
other
than
the
malt
alone
to
balance
out
the
bite
and
bitterness
i
congratulate
stone
on
making
an
ipa
that
i
would
look
forward
to
drinking
again
drinkability
good
ipa
barely
notice
the
alcohol
although
this
is
a
little
lighter
in
abv
than
what
ive
had
or
like
to
enjoy
anymore
anyway
well
balanced
good
take
on
belgian
influence
but
maybe
a
touch
dry
on
the
finish
still
this
is
one
id
have
again
stone
is
truly
royalty
when
it
comes
to
specialty
ales
nice
nose
on
this
one
a
little
of
the
yeasty
character
creeps
out
from
under
the
massive
juicy
hops
i
take
issue
with
the
caliheavy
approach
but
it
definitely
doesnt
make
this
a
bad
beer
even
if
i
would
be
hardpressed
to
differentiate
this
from
some
of
the
other
ipas
from
stone
would
definitely
put
this
above
raging
bitch
too
much
wheat
in
that
one
for
me
and
looking
forward
to
see
how
it
compares
to
the
houblon
chouffe
chilling
in
my
fridge
served
from
tap
into
a
tulip
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
maintains
phenomanol
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
of
fruit
and
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
of
malt
grapefruit
and
subtle
hops
it
had
a
light
with
mdeium
carbonation
overall
this
was
very
nice
and
smooth
the
grapefruit
flavor
combined
with
the
malt
balanced
this
brew
very
nicely
giving
it
great
drinkability
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
given
the
opportunity
would
highly
recommend
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
2
finger
white
head
which
laces
the
walls
aroma
is
very
good
citrus
piney
slight
orange
and
yeast
aroma
from
the
smell
i
cannot
wait
to
taste
it
and
it
does
not
dissappoint
smooth
feel
in
the
mouth
with
lots
of
carbonation
its
a
little
sweet
up
front
in
the
mouth
goes
down
fairly
smooth
then
the
hops
kick
in
with
a
little
bitterness
but
not
overpowering
very
well
balanced
its
very
drinkable
too
excellent
beer
i
wish
that
i
got
more
than
one
bottle
i
could
have
several
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
day
and
be
happy
i
cant
believe
how
much
i
liked
this
brew
stone
is
clearly
no
joke
in
the
brewing
world
d
pretty
good
i
prefer
aipas
but
this
is
a
nice
change
from
hop
bombs
if
you
want
an
aipa
this
is
not
for
you
if
you
want
something
delicious
and
different
then
seek
this
out
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
particularly
exciting
either
i
expected
more
hop
character
orval
or
westmalle
triple
provide
more
hop
interest
d
goes
down
easily
nicely
blended
not
too
filling
and
has
a
nice
kick
to
it
quite
drinkable
but
not
as
a
session
beer
d
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
nice
belgian
flavor
and
i
big
hop
kick
that
you
would
expect
from
stone
for
6
9
abv
the
alcohol
seems
nonexsistent
another
great
offering
from
stone
the
citrus
and
biscuit
dance
well
together
and
the
spice
does
well
with
both
coriander
and
some
sweet
gum
a
bit
of
a
butterscotch
finish
but
i
think
that
was
the
tap
stone
calibelgie
shows
off
the
complexity
yeast
adds
to
a
beer
with
that
one
change
stone
has
taken
their
ipa
and
turned
it
into
a
whole
other
animal
the
belgian
yeast
does
a
beautiful
job
smoothing
out
the
hops
like
a
typical
belgian
ipa
the
lip
smacking
quality
of
a
hoppy
brew
is
put
in
check
the
hop
flavors
are
allowed
to
shine
while
the
bitterness
is
kept
well
under
control
props
to
stone
for
creating
another
tasty
offering
drinkability
better
drinkability
than
raging
bitch
another
american
bipa
its
tastes
dont
wear
you
down
nearly
as
much
interesting
ipa
with
some
fruity
complexity
found
at
whole
foods
in
sacramento
off
arden
d
great
drinkability
from
this
one
im
a
little
peeved
i
waited
so
long
to
finally
pick
up
a
bottle
but
its
still
worth
it
very
excellent
d
an
eminently
drinkable
belgian
ipa
verdict
calibelgique
is
a
tasty
beer
and
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
tried
yet
the
combination
of
belgian
yeast
and
westcoast
hops
is
interesting
and
pleasant
though
i
have
to
say
i
personally
prefer
the
normal
stone
ipa
overall
really
a
terrific
beer
in
my
opinion
belgian
yeast
really
plays
well
off
of
the
american
hops
stone
i
hope
you
make
this
at
the
very
least
a
perennial
seasonal
release
if
not
a
year
round
overall
an
interesting
if
a
bit
unbalanced
offering
from
the
boys
at
stone
thanks
to
the
auspices
of
mr
ohoove
for
this
treat
the
color
of
this
goodie
is
clear
golden
amber
with
a
nice
thick
white
foam
and
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
clovey
yeast
and
herbal
hop
firm
and
tasty
the
flavor
at
room
temperature
offers
orange
citrus
bite
and
malty
clove
theres
some
thick
cereal
grain
and
deep
prune
in
a
mediumplus
bodied
brew
its
a
bit
viscous
with
signs
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
sharp
grapefruit
rind
and
a
dry
rye
effect
all
very
complex
with
modest
drinkability
very
nice
taste
when
u
go
in
a
take
a
slip
its
like
fruits
citrus
bursting
before
u
even
drink
it
super
smooooth
no
alcohol
can
be
found
even
at
5
6
abv
flavorful
awesome
beer
if
u
dont
like
ipas
this
is
the
ipa
to
taste
its
a
cali
belgian
style
idk
what
that
mean
but
the
bottle
says
its
a
california
style
beer
stone
with
hints
of
belgian
flavor
guessing
hefes
where
the
fruit
citrus
come
in
to
play
d
overall
stone
calibelgique
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
repeat
purchase
hightly
recommended
this
is
only
my
second
experience
with
a
belgian
style
ipa
the
other
was
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
which
i
loved
stones
version
is
less
aggressive
i
am
beginning
to
love
this
beer
style
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
with
many
of
the
traditional
aspects
of
this
style
and
those
it
comes
from
certainly
worth
a
try
it
is
great
to
enjoy
on
a
summer
evening
yum
dreally
impressed
with
this
beer
to
be
honest
i
find
it
a
little
more
drinkable
than
the
belgian
versions
of
belgian
ipas
maybe
its
the
lower
alcohol
but
its
really
good
a
22
oz
bomber
is
easy
to
finish
stones
only
ale
brewed
with
a
different
yeast
a
belgian
one
this
is
otherwise
the
standard
ipa
this
beer
was
amazing
and
unexpected
i
am
used
to
being
shocked
by
stone
but
this
beer
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
a
traditional
looking
ipa
except
that
it
is
a
little
light
in
color
clear
tall
rocky
head
that
left
sculpted
concentric
rings
amazingly
the
yeast
aroma
really
battle
with
the
hops
in
the
nose
on
first
sniff
i
was
confused
my
curiosity
aroused
very
spicy
as
well
dominated
by
cloves
i
have
never
had
a
beer
with
such
overt
clove
aroma
is
it
the
belgian
yeast
that
does
this
the
taste
was
all
stone
ipa
but
more
the
brew
tasted
like
a
blend
of
caramel
malts
citrusy
hops
and
a
fruity
taste
the
fruit
was
pineapplemangopeachtangerine
very
intriguing
then
the
hops
wrestled
the
aftertaste
away
again
a
fresh
grassy
sort
of
hops
very
fresh
like
a
wethopped
beer
the
body
was
medium
light
with
average
carbonation
call
the
texture
soft
to
oily
overall
a
great
and
refreshingly
different
beer
its
not
your
traditional
ipa
i
give
stone
top
marks
for
attempting
this
unique
hybrid
and
pulling
it
off
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
i
first
had
this
beer
about
two
years
ago
and
i
am
just
now
finally
reviewing
it
belgian
ipas
are
one
of
the
newest
yet
best
styles
of
beer
around
today
cali
belgique
does
not
only
set
the
standard
for
this
style
it
almost
makes
it
impossible
to
replicate
from
a
bottle
it
pours
a
nice
and
golden
with
a
two
inch
white
head
this
beer
not
only
satisfies
the
quench
of
belgian
beer
fans
but
hop
heads
as
well
the
aroma
is
complete
with
a
belgianpine
combination
i
started
out
as
a
novice
beer
drinker
soley
focused
on
belgian
styles
but
once
my
pallet
for
ipas
devopled
this
beer
was
able
to
my
beer
needs
from
all
angles
drink
this
beer
and
appreciate
all
it
represents
dare
to
try
another
belgian
ipa
once
other
brewers
attempt
such
a
style
cheers
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
a
unique
beer
i
like
the
flavor
of
the
beer
picked
this
up
at
a
great
beer
store
tops
liquor
while
at
a
conference
in
phoenix
clear
bright
yellow
pour
with
nice
fluffy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
all
belgian
in
the
nose
lots
of
spice
lemon
grass
and
hints
of
banana
and
bready
yeast
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
great
balance
between
the
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malt
exactly
what
i
expected
with
the
best
characteristics
of
a
belgian
expertly
infused
with
that
classic
stone
ipa
flavor
highly
drinkable
with
a
nice
crisp
clean
dry
finish
i
live
an
hour
from
belgium
and
have
to
say
that
the
us
craft
brewers
are
giving
the
belgians
a
run
for
their
money
a
great
american
interpretation
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
the
belgianness
of
this
beer
is
even
more
hidden
in
the
taste
obviously
hopforward
but
very
very
balanced
the
esters
provide
sweetness
to
keep
your
palate
in
check
but
it
all
works
in
comparison
to
wilddevil
or
le
freak
this
is
my
favorite
belgianwest
coast
ipa
combo
i
would
think
this
is
a
perfect
crossover
bottle
for
those
looking
to
bring
in
nonbeer
drinkers
flavorful
light
exceedingly
drinkable
i
am
very
thankful
that
my
parents
brought
this
one
to
share
with
me
but
next
time
ill
buy
one
all
for
myself
but
the
flavor
is
good
strong
hop
presence
that
cuts
through
followed
by
agood
amount
of
spice
and
bready
presence
drinks
very
easy
a
nice
take
on
the
style
d
love
the
style
just
like
this
one
a
bit
too
fruity
especially
heavy
on
the
lemoncitrus
and
thin
not
bad
at
all
but
there
are
better
belgian
ipas
out
there
this
is
a
good
beer
i
like
the
concept
and
ipa
combined
with
a
farmhouse
style
ale
american
style
pour
is
nice
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
bubbly
on
top
once
the
foam
subsided
giving
the
beer
a
taste
you
definitely
catch
the
hops
immediately
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
stone
strong
taste
good
amount
of
bitterness
following
up
the
fruityhoppy
mixture
good
amount
of
fruitlemon
flavor
and
you
get
that
light
almost
vanilla
flavor
present
in
a
farmhouse
ale
all
in
all
a
good
combination
i
think
it
was
balanced
well
so
all
flavors
come
through
equally
i
think
they
did
it
right
i
wouldnt
change
anything
with
this
combo
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
concept
its
probably
been
done
before
but
its
the
first
time
ive
seen
it
very
interesing
brew
that
stone
has
offered
us
here
letting
this
one
warm
up
a
little
really
helps
balance
the
belgian
into
the
ipa
i
can
see
myself
dinking
this
again
in
the
future
i
was
very
nicely
surprised
by
this
beer
i
dont
drink
a
ton
of
belgian
beer
so
i
cant
speak
to
that
directly
but
i
loved
this
variation
of
an
ipa
aromatically
it
held
my
attention
very
well
with
lots
of
fruit
and
hops
i
got
a
bit
of
apple
right
through
to
the
taste
followed
by
just
enough
bitterness
to
keep
it
in
balance
i
am
very
happy
when
a
beer
leaves
me
thinking
about
the
next
time
i
will
taste
it
calibeligiquebelgie
is
nice
experiment
one
that
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
good
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
this
very
much
if
it
were
available
to
me
but
i
can
think
of
some
dishes
to
pair
this
beer
with
that
would
be
pretty
kickass
d
an
interesting
beer
easy
drinking
like
a
good
ipa
with
a
little
belgian
funk
in
there
d
very
enjoyable
complex
and
balanced
theres
a
lot
going
on
this
beer
that
sems
to
work
pretty
well
moderate
abv
too
just
get
a
little
full
and
tastebudshock
d
moderately
drinkable
the
bitterness
was
good
but
left
me
wanting
more
it
almost
is
like
a
stone
ipa
with
a
belgian
attitude
i
would
almost
rather
it
be
a
ruination
with
the
belgian
attitude
very
delicious
nevertheless
d
wow
what
a
difference
changing
the
yeast
can
make
this
seems
to
have
very
little
in
common
with
the
regular
stone
ipa
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
belgian
ipa
this
one
is
also
on
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
as
far
as
abv
goes
check
this
one
out
houblon
chouffe
on
tap
redeemed
the
concept
of
the
belgian
ipa
for
me
which
had
dropped
off
over
the
past
year
raging
bitch
was
ultimately
a
sweet
mess
local
brewpubs
followed
suit
and
the
other
random
attempts
id
tried
save
the
wholly
different
wild
devil
which
is
awesome
but
simply
an
ipa
with
brett
in
it
fell
flat
calibelgique
is
the
beer
that
originally
got
me
excited
about
the
style
and
finally
returning
to
it
again
and
fresh
i
can
see
why
its
a
better
ipa
than
our
recent
east
coast
darling
larry
and
the
belgian
influence
just
makes
it
deeper
and
tastier
the
brewers
at
stone
are
geniuses
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
beer
but
i
think
raging
bitch
married
the
belgian
pale
and
american
ipa
elements
a
little
better
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
mouthfeel
is
luscious
too
drinkable
i
can
only
wonder
what
it
tastes
like
fresh
drinkability
the
balance
of
flavors
here
really
does
it
for
me
not
a
complete
bitter
bomb
but
a
well
crafted
creative
ipa
count
me
as
a
fan
drinkability
as
i
mentioned
earlier
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
therefore
i
could
drink
about
two
bombers
of
this
fine
brew
many
of
the
ipas
that
i
have
tried
are
not
well
balanced
and
therefore
lose
their
enjoyment
about
one
glass
in
nice
combination
of
ipa
characteristics
and
belgian
yeast
a
real
nice
brew
was
looking
for
something
else
they
didnt
have
it
got
this
instead
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
nice
surprise
i
must
admit
this
is
only
my
second
foray
into
this
style
and
i
continue
to
be
intrigued
pours
a
bright
and
slightly
hazy
straw
color
decent
sized
white
head
that
recedes
slowly
leaving
some
nice
lacing
behind
nose
is
true
to
the
label
a
distinctly
belgian
scent
with
some
hops
mixed
in
taste
follows
suit
belgian
yeast
up
front
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
wasnt
blown
away
but
definitely
a
good
drinkable
brew
id
be
pouring
another
one
if
i
had
a
second
bomber
d
im
pretty
much
torn
on
this
one
as
i
like
stone
and
belgian
ipas
but
the
taste
doesnt
make
me
love
it
like
other
belgian
ipas
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
an
authentic
version
worth
a
try
though
if
you
see
it
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
big
clumps
of
lace
smell
floral
spicy
lemon
zest
a
little
musty
grain
soft
pear
and
a
hint
of
pepper
taste
spicy
and
lightly
tropical
peppery
background
clove
citrus
peel
a
little
cantaloupe
in
the
back
of
the
finish
everyone
seems
to
be
making
west
coast
hopped
belgian
ipas
but
this
is
a
good
one
best
by
710
d
very
good
had
this
cask
version
made
with
palisades
hops
when
visiting
stone
nice
head
retention
and
lacing
off
the
pour
top
a
nice
pale
gold
the
nose
had
a
nice
hay
character
to
complement
the
fresh
fir
notes
from
the
hops
even
some
faint
horse
blanket
notes
this
version
finishes
really
clean
my
gf
had
the
std
calibelgique
off
the
tap
and
this
one
had
a
much
cleaner
hop
character
and
mouthfeel
if
i
had
any
qualms
id
say
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
even
for
being
on
cask
the
taste
is
unique
the
beer
is
rather
dry
up
front
but
finishes
rather
wet
taste
is
malty
and
hops
and
oh
yes
lots
of
spice
overall
a
very
unique
beer
and
quite
tasty
final
thoughts
this
is
a
miss
for
me
the
only
other
beer
ive
had
of
the
style
was
allagash
hugh
malone
which
i
had
on
tap
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
perhaps
freshness
is
an
issue
given
the
sensitivity
of
highly
hopped
beers
i
did
buy
it
unrefrigerated
but
of
course
until
we
have
bottle
dating
on
every
bottle
well
never
know
and
so
on
and
so
forth
or
maybe
this
is
a
world
class
example
of
the
style
and
maybe
it
just
isnt
for
me
overall
a
good
beer
from
stone
that
represents
the
two
styles
well
raise
an
ipa
in
belgium
and
this
is
what
you
get
makes
sense
d
another
interesting
and
tasty
offering
from
stone
their
ipa
being
one
of
my
favorites
it
was
nice
to
try
it
with
a
twist
i
think
i
still
prefer
the
original
but
im
glad
i
tried
this
and
would
try
it
again
overall
a
unique
brew
but
definitely
paying
tribute
to
traditional
belgium
ipas
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
makes
me
wish
i
had
bought
more
at
the
greenlife
in
asheville
big
ups
to
asheville
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
and
pulls
off
a
very
nice
combo
of
styles
in
this
relatively
newly
established
hybrid
slot
strong
aroma
is
hoppy
and
evergreen
with
a
firm
sour
citrus
overtone
a
mixture
of
lemon
and
orange
with
just
a
whisper
of
lime
it
pours
an
average
golden
amber
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
but
appearance
is
this
beers
weakest
suit
flavor
is
fairly
hoppy
but
pleasantly
sour
citrus
dominates
with
orange
and
lemon
and
a
little
bit
of
lime
texture
is
exceptionally
smooth
yet
tingly
and
fizzy
enough
for
a
beer
recommended
to
all
hopheads
mouthfeel
very
complex
you
get
bits
of
honey
grass
sweet
but
hops
is
still
at
the
forefront
fn
yum
price
is
ouch
whatd
i
pay
10
for
a
pintimperial
pint
worth
it
you
know
it
another
winner
from
stone
and
i
really
liked
that
they
didnt
feel
the
need
to
have
a
huge
abv
to
provide
a
huge
flavor
it
was
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
and
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
i
like
the
fact
that
the
abv
is
a
bit
lower
than
some
of
the
other
prominent
representatives
that
means
i
can
have
more
than
one
of
a
very
enjoyable
balanced
and
complex
brew
oelergud
d
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
stones
best
a
little
light
on
the
hops
and
from
my
perspective
quite
tame
for
a
stone
beer
however
very
drinkable
neither
hoppedup
as
most
california
ipas
or
as
funky
as
most
belgians
whats
wierd
is
that
i
tasted
this
a
couple
of
times
in
2009
and
liked
it
i
wonder
if
this
bottle
is
a
little
bacterial
came
from
a
store
cooler
in
san
diego
d
a
well
crafted
hybrid
id
have
another
this
is
a
fun
one
to
drink
the
taste
volleys
between
belgian
and
ipa
unable
to
settle
on
one
or
the
other
d
just
as
high
with
any
other
ipa
i
enjoyed
this
one
alot
and
will
get
it
again
when
i
see
it
this
beer
is
pretty
bomb
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
overall
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
tons
of
flavor
very
broad
spectrum
of
tastes
certainly
a
throwdown
to
the
belgian
brewers
making
ipas
stone
oneupped
them
here
using
the
belgian
yeast
in
addition
to
the
customary
inyourface
hops
the
fruity
candysugar
notes
from
the
yeast
played
nicely
against
the
assertive
hops
although
a
little
under
7
abv
is
nothing
to
sneeze
at
this
beer
seems
even
bigger
notes
nice
approach
to
a
belgium
ipa
almost
close
to
setting
a
trend
to
what
some
standard
interpretations
of
this
style
may
turn
to
in
the
states
for
instance
this
one
feels
very
close
to
the
raging
bitch
from
flying
dog
which
is
another
great
offering
this
was
definitely
a
unique
brew
im
pretty
sure
its
my
first
belgian
ipa
so
i
didnt
really
know
what
i
was
in
for
thanks
again
toby
much
appreciated
this
is
very
enjoyable
simple
and
not
over
the
top
something
that
i
would
recommend
d
tasty
a
nicely
balanced
version
of
the
style
sampled
at
rustico
alexandria
va
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
ipas
and
certainly
one
that
has
everything
you
would
expect
from
stone
another
solid
beer
from
stone
recommended
drinkability
this
is
a
very
quaffable
calibelgian
ale
and
proof
that
stone
can
offer
subtle
quality
when
needed

one
grew
on
me
as
i
went

beer

is
relatively

directly
afterwards
to
note
the
differences
which
are
definitely
in
its
fruity
sweetness
worth
checking
out
overall
it
is
interesting
and
unusual
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
soapy
bubble
gum
and
bitter
blend
it
was
a
little
reminiscent
of
a
british
nitro
ale
on
the
plus
side
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
quite
decent
but
the
overwhelming
bitterness
negates
all
of
the
other
flavors
seeing
as
how
its
getting
a
lot
of
good
reviews
however
i
may
try
calibelgique
again
out
of
fairness
perhaps
my
palate
was
affected
by
something
else
that
day
not
really
a
session
ale
but
not
supposed
to
be
i
could
see
drinking
a
couple
because
its
so
good
but
for
most
one
will
satisfy
if
not
sit
heavy
d
very
intriguing
and
enjoyable
ill
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
d
pretty
darn
good
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
cali
than
belgique
very
drinkable
what
an
interesting
beer
like
i
was
saying
in
the
description
its
sort
of
an
american
ipa
with
belgian
influences
rather
than
deranke
or
others
that
are
belgians
with
american
touches
cool
beer
way
to
go
stone
notes
a
really
unique
beer
that
captures
both
styles
really
well
probably
best
when
fresh
thanks
michael
for
getting
this
beer
into
vermont
beer
poured
a
light
orange
with
a
white
long
lasting
head
nose
is
belgian
yeast
citrus
hops
and
hints
of
belgian
candy
taste
is
light
malts
a
bit
of
sweet
candied
sugar
white
pepper
finishing
with
a
blast
of
west
coast
hops
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
lively
from
the
carbonation
and
semismooth
when
gliding
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
definitely
a
fun
twist
on
their
wonderful
ipa
it
may
benefit
from
more
of
a
malt
backbone
to
even
the
hop
volume
nice
effort
recommended
for
hopheads
to
try
the
taste
was
pretty
peppery
with
a
soft
malt
backbone
in
the
mouth
it
was
lively
and
highly
carbonated
overall
an
interesting
effort
md
beer
was
smooth
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
nice
carbonation
to
it
and
a
medium
body
feel
this
is
a
solid
beer
one
that
i
may
pick
up
again
in
the
future
but
more
than
likely
will
stick
to
the
straight
ipa
this
beer
pours
a
very
pretty
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
recedes
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
really
nice
with
the
belgian
yeast
works
well
with
the
hops
a
nice
balance
the
taste
loses
me
a
little
bit
the
sweet
malt
and
belgian
flavors
fall
behind
the
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
the
co2
is
a
bit
much
for
it
could
have
been
better
but
its
still
a
damn
good
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aromam
is
great
it
has
a
refreshing
hop
and
belgian
yeast
aroma
its
bitter
with
a
solid
malt
base
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
nice
and
fruity
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
bitter
hop
taste
with
a
thin
malt
flavor
and
a
dry
fruity
yeast
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
tastey
beer
but
its
too
bitter
and
lacks
malt
character
slightly
hazy
dark
gold
with
a
thin
whitish
cap
of
fine
bubbles
quite
a
bit
of
streaky
lacing
good
head
retention
for
whats
present
big
citrus
hop
presence
in
the
nose
grapefruit
and
pine
a
bit
powdery
but
with
some
pineappletropical
character
bubblegum
and
faint
spice
as
well
same
in
the
flavour
coming
together
in
a
sweettartlike
fruitiness
but
with
a
solid
bitterness
mild
sweetness
was
mostly
fruity
with
a
hint
of
strawberry
rather
than
malty
closer
to
light
than
medium
bodied
and
fairly
dry
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
rough
side
i
liked
it
the
difference
in
yeast
added
more
complexity
than
i
expected
but
a
slightly
modified
malt
bill
would
probably
improve
the
texture
and
create
something
truly
impressive
theres
some
powdery
floral
hops
and
chewy
resin
in
here
astringent
lemon
peel
and
some
slices
like
white
pepper
and
clove
its
just
an
ipa
big
chewy
and
bitter
with
some
metallic
funk
drinkablility
isnt
really
there
its
just
too
onedimensional
for
me
to
enjoy
in
large
quantities
i
got
bored
by
the
bottom
of
my
22
you
want
a
really
good
belgian
ipa
go
with
choffe
same
price
yet
delicious
this
poured
a
clear
gold
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
rose
and
lemon
and
wild
yeast
with
a
bit
of
honey
it
tasted
like
wild
yeast
and
lemon
with
some
honey
and
floral
rose
hops
it
was
watery
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
well
done
belgian
ipa
but
unfortunately
that
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
it
was
clean
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
it
had
decent
body
i
might
have
missed
some
of
the
subtlety
to
the
flavor
since
this
had
such
a
delicate
character
but
i
wasnt
in
love
with
the
taste
it
was
very
nicely
crafted
and
it
helped
me
appreciate
stone
more
as
a
brewery
even
if
this
beer
isnt
quite
my
style
drinkability
is
high
another
excellent
stone
offering
very
complex
without
being
to
heavy
or
overly
strong
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
and
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
at
the
brewery
i
buy
this
stuff
by
the
case
its
my
favorite
style
and
well
stone
is
a
good
brewery
its
well
done
and
cheap
good
daily
night
ender
overall
impression
nice
twist
on
a
great
ipa
plenty
of
great
hop
flavors
with
an
interesting
yeast
note
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
id
love
to
see
it
in
6
packs
i
didnt
expect
to
be
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
but
i
am
very
surprised
this
would
be
a
perfect
hoppy
summer
beer
for
me
id
get
my
hop
fix
while
still
having
something
relatively
light
to
drink
the
hops
are
all
over
the
board
in
terms
of
flavor
in
a
good
way
and
there
are
lots
of
layers
to
delve
into
more
so
than
in
most
other
belgian
ipas
ive
had
very
nice
not
bad
at
all
i
like
this
example
of
the
style
it
has
a
definite
stone
feel
to
it
my
only
problem
is
that
belgian
part
of
this
beer
seems
lost
regardless
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
giving
this
a
shot
picked
this
up
at
the
brewery
was
worth
a
shot
picked
this
one
up
from
the
factory
split
this
one
with
a
buddy
and
i
found
it
to
be
more
pleasant
than
i
was
expecting
the
mouth
feel
is
smoother
than
you
would
expect
from
stones
ipa
tag
i
like
this
as
much
as
the
vertical
epic
ale
which
is
a
tough
comparison
for
some
overall
this
a
heck
of
a
beer
a
must
try
for
any
stone
fan
drinkability
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
and
i
could
sure
go
for
another
d
overall
good
drinkability
easy
enough
to
consume
but
somehow
was
expecting
more
from
this
good
but
only
moderatly
enjoyable
drinks
much
bigger
then
its
advertised
6
9
abv
feel
and
drinkability
this
one
has
a
mediumfull
body
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
carbonation
is
lower
overall
but
this
beer
is
packed
with
so
much
flavor
that
any
more
carbonation
would
be
devastating
to
it
there
is
nothing
i
would
change
about
the
way
this
beer
feels
this
is
one
that
im
definitely
going
to
pick
up
again
after
all
this
isnt
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
the
first
time
ive
really
studied
it
yes
im
not
sure
if
id
call
this
a
belgian
ipa
its
more
like
exactly
in
between
and
belgain
tripelbspa
and
an
american
ipa
it
seems
to
me
that
belgian
ipas
such
as
chouffees
belgian
ipa
and
piraat
are
a
bit
different
to
me
this
seems
to
be
different
than
either
of
those
alcohol
warming
on
the
slightly
dry
finish
d
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
and
quite
a
novel
idea
just
not
for
me

d
this
was
more
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
than
anything
else
i
thought
it
was
good
but
not
great
and
i
dont
think
id
really
seek
it
out
again
very
very
drinkable
chuggable
in
fact
this
is
very
good
high
quality
beer
overall
i
split
this
with
a
friend
and
im
glad
i
did
i
dont
think
i
wouldve
finished
the
whole
bomber
it
certainly
is
interesting
but
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
duvel
style
belgians
and
this
was
too
much
of
that
for
me
im
trying
to
be
fair
in
my
grade
as
this
was
something
i
wanted
to
try
but
the
style
is
not
for
me
d
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
brew
from
stone
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
heavier
on
the
ipa
but
it
still
drank
easily
and
displayed
some
nice
complexities
according
to
the
label
about
half
say
calibelgie
flemish
and
the
other
half
the
one
i
have
is
as
it
is
listed
here
french
cool
that
they
thought
of
both
belgian
cultures
d
not
my
favorite
of
the
stone
offering
the
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
i
really
dont
think
that
this
strain
of
yeast
works
all
that
well
with
the
aggressiveness
of
the
stone
ipa
dfirst
time
ive
had
this
one
and
i
am
a
fan
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
little
more
carbonated
than
the
standard
stone
ipa
overall
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easily
im
still
not
sold
on
the
belgian
ipa
myself
and
it
seems
to
clash
a
bit
to
my
taste
buds
this
was
nice
but
id
rather
have
the
regular
ipa
or
ruination
taste
is
quite
bitter
throughout
but
especially
on
the
back
palate
and
finish
first
flavour
is
again
kind
of
tangy
with
quite
a
refreshing
bent
and
descends
quickly
maybe
a
bit
too
quickly
into
that
very
hoppy
finish
with
a
slight
lemon
squash
flavour
to
go
along
with
it
mouthfeel
is
light
and
frothy
like
toothpaste
but
yeah
really
pleasant
and
drinkable
main
palate
is
a
bit
short
but
otherwise
very
nice
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
well
done
and
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
im
usually
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
was
not
super
impressed
by
this
offering
which
i
find
strange
since
stone
makes
such
good
ipas
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
special
pours
and
orangish
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
has
belgian
yeasts
and
fruity
hops
over
candy
malts
taste
is
light
on
the
belgian
spice
and
on
the
bitter
hops
medium
to
full
body
is
well
carbonated
moutfeel
is
alright
drinkable
enough
but
i
might
want
something
else
over
the
course
of
an
evening
dsurprisingly
well
done
why
i
didnt
think
that
such
dissimilar
styles
could
be
combined
to
such
a
good
effect
the
sum
is
definately
worth
more
than
the
parts
tomorrow
i
head
out
to
but
more
to
stockpile
before
the
stores
run
out
nuff
said
ive
had
this
on
tap
a
few
times
but
this
is
the
first
time
in
the
bottle
i
found
it
to
be
much
better
on
tap
in
the
bottle
is
it
just
a
decent
belgianstyle
ipa
definitely
worth
trying
but
i
recommend
it
on
tap
very
good
and
something
that
i
would
drink
often
d
interesting
and
drinkable
the
aroma
is
excellent
but
the
flavor
doesnt
live
up
to
it
there
is
a
lack
of
belgian
character
in
the
flavor
even
though
the
nose
exhibits
lots
of
yeasty
goodness
in
the
end
it
comes
off
as
mostly
ipa
and
just
a
little
bit
belgian
d
6
9
abv
is
well
masked
a
few
of
these
in
the
summer
heat
would
sneak
up
on
me
i
have
to
admit
im
a
sucker
for
a
good
stone
i
like
the
hops
and
i
love
belgian
beer
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
cant
comment
too
much
on
the
appearance
it
was
dark
in
the
room
i
was
drinking
this
it
was
light
in
color
and
had
a
nice
head
great
smell
a
combination
of
the
malty
sweetness
of
a
tripel
overlayed
with
a
good
hop
freshness
the
taste
mimicked
this
scent
but
with
a
little
stronger
hops
flavor
bordering
on
citrus
i
drank
this
with
some
moderately
spicy
thai
food
and
it
complimented
the
panang
curry
squid
nicely
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
you
like
stone
belgian
or
anything
with
hops
give
this
one
a
try
it
poured
a
very
nice
dark
amber
color
the
aromas
were
very
much
like
the
name
suggests
very
true
to
a
belgian
spciy
and
citrusyfloral
with
hints
of
honey
then
you
get
the
aroma
of
the
hops
which
added
to
the
citrus
gave
it
an
almost
blood
orange
scent
taste
was
just
outstanding
typical
belgian
triple
flavors
spicy
and
slightly
yeasty
but
with
a
nice
blast
of
hops
which
gave
it
a
nice
grapefruit
citrus
like
finish
in
my
opinion
the
best
beer
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
this
is
a
perfect
food
beer
i
had
it
with
sauteed
red
snapper
with
a
lemon
butter
sauce
and
it
went
perfect
i
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
d
a
very
good
experiment
by
stone
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
out
hazy
orange
into
tulip
glass
small
white
head
that
disolves
quickly
great
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
very
belgiumlike
almost
smells
like
a
good
wit
lots
of
spiced
scents
the
taste
was
much
the
same
the
hoppy
bit
of
an
ipa
with
the
orange
spice
of
a
belgium
wit
this
made
for
a
absolutly
great
compliment
to
the
grilled
tuna
i
had
with
this
beer
the
carbonation
was
just
right
for
a
great
mouthfeel
and
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
i
thought
this
was
quite
easy
going
down
despite
combining
two
rather
intenselyflavored
beer
profiles
my
first
bipa
and
a
good
beer
for
sure
would
like
to
see
more
yeasty
balance
but
coming
from
stone
its
no
surprise
the
hops
are
the
focus
d
all
in
all
not
too
bad
not
quite
to
style
but
that
is
fine
with
me
i
find
the
americans
really
miss
this
style
sometimes
worth
trying
though
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
2
white
head
and
good
lacing
it
definitely
smells
like
a
belgian
floral
and
hoppy
wow
tastes
like
hops
and
more
hops
fading
to
a
pleasant
grapefruit
tang
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
warm
day
very
refreshing
probably
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
but
it
was
nice
to
try
this
once
poured
an
amber
to
golden
color
with
a
quater
inch
white
head
on
top
the
head
laces
nicely
along
the
glass
a
splash
of
spicy
sweetness
with
a
yeasty
bread
frgrances
the
bready
yeastiness
hits
the
palate
at
the
front
blending
to
a
mild
grapefruit
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
grassiness
at
the
end
a
light
feel
at
the
front
it
crisply
dances
across
the
palate
leaving
a
mild
dryness
on
the
back
of
the
palate
this
maybe
one
of
the
most
well
balanced
belgian
ipa
it
is
not
overly
hoppy
though
bringing
some
hop
strength
with
it
along
with
a
strong
yeasty
twang
this
is
a
very
strong
beer
from
a
very
unique
style
poured
into
a
wine
glass
for
a
nice
opaque
orange
body
with
bubbly
carbonation
onefinger
white
head
and
it
looks
like
little
yeast
floaties
doubt
it
plus
a
ring
of
lace
a
floral
hop
smell
is
what
i
notice
first
so
typical
of
stone
and
then
also
picked
some
citric
and
lemonzest
smells
also
some
orange
andor
heavy
fruit
in
the
smell
along
with
that
belgian
smell
of
yeast
and
sweetcaramel
malts
the
taste
is
similiar
with
this
being
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
is
balanced
between
both
styles
has
some
caramel
and
sweet
malts
and
bread
to
make
it
a
little
chewey
and
sweet
while
the
hops
are
clearly
evident
in
both
passing
citric
floral
taste
and
on
the
backbite
crisp
and
dry
also
minor
fruit
notes
include
orange
and
a
tad
of
grape
and
tartness
has
a
very
minor
champagne
like
quality
could
also
be
from
carbonation
warms
a
little
as
you
sip
but
with
a
lower
than
usual
abv
from
stone
and
my
affinity
towards
them
i
wish
they
would
make
this
a
permanent
offering
d
this
is
a
great
offering
from
stone
its
no
houblon
chouffe
dobbelen
ipa
tripel
but
is
still
a
darn
tasty
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
and
delicious
good
american
interpretation
of
the
style
and
a
great
beer
overall
going
down
like
a
charm
as
it
warms
up
im
liking
it
even
more
drinkability
tasty
and
fairly
light
like
stone
ipa
but
with
a
strong
sourness
that
masks
the
hops
to
some
extent
nice
and
refreshing
hopefully
i
can
try
this
one
again
d
there
is
really
no
alcohol
burn
at
all
which
is
not
surprising
with
the
abv
it
is
pretty
balanced
with
the
finish
just
slightly
bitter
it
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
for
an
ipa
d
i
like
this
much
more
than
the
stone
collaboration
ale
the
abv
is
lower
and
less
boozy
and
the
flavor
profile
is
very
intriguing
my
sister
picked
this
up
in
nyc
for
me
and
i
am
very
happy
with
the
results
duvel
was
one
of
my
first
belgiumcraft
beersand
is
still
a
favorite
of
mine
that
helped
push
me
into
this
scene
and
because
of
my
newfound
beer
hobby
i
have
also
taken
a
likeing
to
ipas
to
me
this
a
great
combination
of
the
two
beer
realms
i
love
the
clovehop
combination
that
this
beer
brings
and
i
am
going
to
explore
further
into
the
belgium
ipa
style
my
only
negative
is
that
even
though
stone
is
offered
in
nc
i
cannot
find
this
anywhere
d
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
i
would
rather
have
my
belgians
taste
like
belgians
and
my
ipas
taste
like
ipas
other
than
the
fact
that
this
seems
sligtly
more
attenuated
than
stone
ipa
im
not
really
seeing
much
of
a
difference
not
a
bad
beer
but
im
not
getting
it
nose
is
as
touted
sweet
fruity
belgian
qualities
intermingling
with
a
solid
hop
presence
taste
is
dry
fruits
and
flowery
hops
simple
but
effective
mouthfeel
could
be
better
but
its
still
good
same
for
drinkability
overall
i
will
have
this
again
it
is
a
very
good
brew
i
will
especially
get
it
if
i
see
it
on
cask
or
tap
had
a
hard
time
scoring
this
one
bc
it
is
so
easily
enjoyed
tried
to
back
off
the
ratings
a
bit
bc
the
le
freak
i
remember
being
more
impressive
on
the
palate
but
this
is
a
very
strong
contender
this
is
a
very
good
not
great
belgian
ipa
its
very
smooth
and
has
good
flavor
but
i
wish
that
flavor
were
amped
up
just
a
decibel
or
so
its
very
well
balanced
however
and
certainly
quite
enjoyable
its
also
incredibly
drinkable
definitely
recommended
if
you
can
still
find
it
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
is
mostly
ipa
with
a
hint
of
belgian
mouthfeel
was
more
understated
than
i
expected
somewhat
on
the
thin
side
mild
carbonation
great
ale
to
be
recommended
with
all
but
the
very
finest
i
think
that
houblon
and
hopsinjoor
are
more
drinkable
belgian
ipas
get
thee
to
a
brewery
pours
clear
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
very
interesting
nose
actiually
like
a
combination
of
belgium
and
cali
with
yeast
and
flowers
mingling
with
pine
and
grapefruittaste
is
very
smooth
with
a
lot
of
sweet
malts
up
front
and
a
light
bitter
finish
the
strong
hop
aroma
did
not
translate
into
the
taste
although
it
was
quite
drinkable
medium
carbonation
and
body
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
a
very
nice
beer
that
im
enjoying
drinking
stone
has
really
caught
my
eye
with
some
of
the
belgian
styles
coming
out
of
the
brewery
this
one
certainly
shows
that
promise
nice
american
hopping
to
a
belgian
blonde
although
it
might
cut
down
on
drinking
more
than
one
drinkability
is
low
for
me
i
just
didnt
care
for
this
too
much
solid
medium
body
with
active
carbonation
aftertaste
has
just
as
much
yeast
as
hops
not
overly
bitter
by
any
means
i
wish
this
one
would
have
shown
up
in
md
i
would
absolutely
buy
this
again
good
job
stone
pours
a
transparent
golden
orange
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
leaves
some
sticking
nice
hop
aroma
in
the
nose
paired
with
a
strong
yeast
character
pineapple
apricot
banana
and
peach
fruit
notes
nice
big
bright
cali
hop
flavor
excellent
malt
balance
and
a
very
distinct
yeast
note
very
true
to
its
style
it
really
shows
the
best
of
both
worlds
medium
bodied
and
at
only
6
9
i
could
drink
this
all
day
md
medium
bodied
with
an
excellent
level
of
bitterness
drinkability
is
high
an
excellent
experiment
by
the
stone
guys
yet
again
goes
down
nicely
but
im
not
sure
i
like
the
melding
of
what
to
me
are
two
distinct
styles
ill
have
to
try
others
and
see
if
its
the
style
or
the
beer
that
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
it
is
just
a
strange
combination
for
sure
overall
really
shocking
i
think
ive
found
the
first
belgianyeast
beer
that
i
can
find
tolerable
to
sit
through
is
it
the
best
beer
stones
ever
made
definitely
not
but
it
opens
a
window
of
hope
for
that
belgian
beer
that
i
was
getting
so
bored
of
d
kinda
of
a
sipper
kinda
of
stone
ipa
mixed
with
some
belgian
yeast
i
like
where
stone
went
with
creation
look
forward
to
more
of
these
drinkability
this
one
is
a
nice
slow
sipper
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
worth
picking
this
up
if
available
poured
into
my
stone
ruination
pint
glass
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
white
fizzy
head
with
some
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
left
around
the
nose
is
hoppy
malty
yeasty
with
some
spice
citrus
the
taste
is
hoppy
maltyyeasty
a
little
citrus
slips
in
and
some
spice
medium
body
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
drinkable
you
can
definitely
taste
the
beligian
influence
on
this
brew
very
good
beer
im
usually
go
for
an
ipa
or
stout
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
try
it
if
you
can
get
it
especially
on
limited
production
as
i
stated
above
it
took
me
a
few
sips
to
try
and
figure
out
what
they
were
trying
to
do
here
once
that
happened
i
liked
it
its
not
great
but
a
decent
offering
and
a
style
that
is
growing
on
me
not
a
bad
effort
not
sure
if
these
styles
match
though
the
strong
piney
hoppiness
clashes
a
little
with
the
sweet
belgian
yeast
flavor
takes
a
little
getting
used
too
very
different
than
other
belgian
ipas
but
a
decent
brew
cheers
more
of
a
belgian
ale
in
appearance
light
in
color
with
a
white
head
which
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
abv
and
hops
are
more
consistent
with
a
toned
down
american
pale
ale
than
a
revved
up
british
version
stone
as
per
usual
puts
forward
a
refreshing
brew
that
is
very
drinkable
though
expected
hints
of
fruit
in
this
ipa
arent
all
that
present
the
sweetness
of
a
belgian
ale
is
there
this
is
a
good
combination
ale
but
i
do
prefer
stones
individual
efforts
in
regard
to
these
two
styles
individually
i
have
to
say
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
different
yet
familiar
in
two
different
ways
d
pretty
damn
good
ive
had
more
intensely
hoppy
belgian
ipas
and
at
first
i
was
sort
of
underwhelmed
by
this
however
once
i
spent
some
time
with
it
i
realized
how
nice
it
is
and
id
definitely
drink
this
again
and
will
finish
the
bomber
oh
yes
good
work
stone
very
drinkable
for
a
stone
beer
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
or
heaviness
to
weigh
you
down
and
enough
carbonation
to
make
you
feel
refreshed
not
groggy
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
hybrid
styles
and
perhaps
this
is
one
of
the
top
american
examples
if
not
the
top
its
not
flawless
but
it
is
bold
and
adventurous
and
it
comes
across
as
fun
and
nicely
blended
the
manageable
abv
and
understated
complexity
give
it
a
solidly
drinkable
character
its
a
nice
benchmark
for
a
damned
intriguing
international
union
poured
in
to
my
duvel
tulip
reddish
golden
rust
color
incredibly
clear
to
look
through
small
head
with
minimal
lacing
smelled
of
grapefruit
and
hops
taste
was
nice
and
hoppy
but
not
so
bitter
as
most
stone
beers
which
i
love
working
through
the
glass
the
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
seemed
to
diminsh
mouthfeel
was
average
nothing
great
or
bad
drinkability
was
good
as
the
flavor
was
fairly
mild
i
would
say
although
a
good
beer
a
little
tame
compared
to
stones
other
remarkable
beers
probably
will
pass
when
i
next
see
this
in
the
store
but
glad
i
tried
it
d
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
the
aroma
and
look
are
a
bit
weaker
than
i
thought
they
would
be
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
it
would
make
a
fine
hot
weather
day
this
beer
will
quench
any
thirst
and
the
abv
is
low
enough
so
you
can
easily
kill
a
couple
bombers
just
well
rounded
and
enjoyable
hopefully
this
brew
come
around
again
overall
a
good
beer
dont
know
if
i
would
get
another
one
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
this
beer
pours
an
extremly
clear
amber
with
a
1
fingered
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
kind
of
muted
but
what
i
get
from
it
is
some
malt
tones
the
taste
is
nice
and
complex
some
nice
malt
flavors
a
decent
hop
after
taste
citrus
mixed
with
the
belgian
yeast
gives
it
kind
of
a
breadbanana
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
qwith
a
decent
carbonation
level
and
a
slight
dry
aftertaste
a
highly
drinkable
brew
just
wish
it
was
a
little
cheaper
so
i
could
drink
a
few
7
50
a
bomber
is
a
little
over
my
drink
on
a
normal
basis
d
stones
touch
on
the
style
is
extremely
drinkable
d
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
a
very
nice
beer
overall
im
a
little
bit
disappointed
by
this
beer
its
a
good
belgian
ipa
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
flavor
intensity
of
some
of
the
best
ones
the
color
is
a
wonderful
bright
gold
with
an
pretty
good
beige
head
the
nose
is
yeasty
and
hoppy
its
much
more
yeasty
than
i
was
expecting
and
not
quite
enough
hop
intensity
the
same
goes
for
the
flavor
but
lack
of
stronger
hops
kind
of
frustrates
me
it
might
just
be
that
they
should
have
upped
the
malt
and
alcohol
so
that
the
hops
pronounced
more
flavor
than
just
grapefruit
rind
bitterness
and
light
astringency
the
mouthfeel
also
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
the
hops
really
want
to
be
fruity
but
the
aftertaste
is
more
astringent
than
bitter
nearly
unpleasantly
so
its
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
im
probably
being
a
little
too
harsh
its
good
beer
definitely
enjoyable
my
criticism
is
sort
of
nitpicky
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
pours
a
pretty
golden
orange
color
great
clarity
the
head
is
disappointing
short
lived
and
settled
into
almost
nothingness
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
tropical
fruit
and
candied
apricots
some
peppery
spice
and
a
light
grassy
hop
interesting
mix
of
the
sweetness
and
the
hops
in
the
flavor
the
flavors
hit
a
different
times
yet
kind
of
mix
nicely
noticable
belgian
flavors
from
the
yeast
pale
malt
sweet
though
not
sure
from
candi
sugar
some
honeysuckle
and
a
nice
balancing
hop
the
hops
are
more
pronounced
then
the
european
hops
typically
used
in
belgian
made
bipas
the
feel
is
quite
light
prickly
carbonation
finishes
sweet
and
slightly
sticky
definitely
an
american
made
bipa
there
is
always
an
odd
sweetness
with
these
perhaps
the
strong
tropical
fruit
flavor
the
hops
are
in
perfect
balance
they
dont
overpower
allowing
the
belgian
yeast
to
shine
through
seems
boozier
than
the
6
9abv
bottle
from
bottle
barn
in
santa
rosa
pours
a
nice
clean
orange
to
red
with
a
puffy
one
inch
head
that
settles
down
into
a
creamy
looking
film
very
bright
and
clean
looking
quite
pretty
nose
reminds
me
of
another
belgian
style
ipa
ive
had
kuhnhenns
aldebaran
fruity
and
yeasty
nose
with
definite
pear
and
floral
notes
very
inviting
and
reminiscent
of
the
kuhnhenn
beer
which
is
an
exciting
prospect
to
me
flavor
is
quite
nice
kind
of
sweet
and
fruity
like
a
pearapricot
jolly
rancher
but
with
a
nice
floral
hop
complement
and
a
solid
malt
base
thats
syrupy
but
not
too
much
so
a
dry
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
isnt
altogether
welcome
but
a
solid
tasty
flavor
nonetheless
i
like
it
more
as
i
get
further
along
isnt
that
always
the
case
urp
medium
bodied
even
a
little
creamlike
feel
not
think
but
still
milkshake
like
in
texture
somehow
drinks
well
hey
i
guess
i
really
like
everything
about
this
one
not
as
good
as
that
aldebaran
but
itll
do
in
a
pinch
this
beer
certainly
lived
up
to
my
expectations
for
the
style
a
very
interesting
hybrid
and
one
that
ill
enjoy
again
for
sure
picked
this
up
at
greens
as
i
am
drawn
to
just
about
anything
from
stone
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
couple
of
tulips
to
split
with
my
wife
since
she
is
the
belgian
fan
and
i
am
the
ipa
fan
pours
a
thick
foamy
white
head
on
top
of
a
golden
highly
carbonated
looking
ale
definitely
takes
on
the
appearance
of
a
belgian
golden
ale
the
aroma
is
lacking
much
distinct
character
definitely
some
citrus
hints
and
maybe
what
i
would
call
a
crisp
aroma
nothing
much
in
the
way
of
hops
though
taste
is
light
and
tart
due
to
the
previously
mentioned
carbonation
i
do
enjoy
the
balance
between
what
the
belgian
yeast
did
to
the
west
coast
ipa
style
it
is
a
light
ale
and
the
carbonation
takes
a
bit
away
from
the
mouthfeel
in
my
opinion
i
realize
its
not
an
ipa
but
this
one
lacks
a
bit
too
much
in
the
character
department
for
me
to
seek
out
but
it
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
try
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
this
is
the
first
belgian
ipa
that
ive
tried
and
im
impressed
with
it
i
hope
that
this
newer
styled
beer
takes
off
because
it
is
really
good
d
delicious
stuff
ill
buy
again
so
yea
its
drinkable
an
interesting
variation
kind
of
startling
how
far
away
this
beer
is
from
the
standard
ipa
yeast
changed
the
whole
character
of
the
beer
unfortunately
i
feel
like
the
beer
loses
some
major
character
from
the
transfer
the
malt
and
hops
notes
just
kind
of
get
tangled
up
in
the
yeast
and
the
result
is
a
beer
thats
just
very
yeastdominated
in
the
end
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
but
not
the
masterpiece
the
ipa
is
22
oz6
99wine
specialist
not
a
bad
sipper
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
a
lot
of
it
the
style
is
interesting
and
stones
is
a
pretty
interpretation
overall
sweet
and
creamy
a
real
tasty
bipa
no
harsh
alc
and
plenty
of
flavors
popping
out
at
you
extremely
drinkable
despite
6
9
abv
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
ipa
another
great
offering
from
stone
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
as
long
i
can
get
somebody
else
to
cart
my
ass
around
pretty
standard
ipa
appearance
with
a
clear
orangegolden
body
a
two
finger
thick
head
and
lively
carbonation
streamers
the
smell
was
floral
hoppy
with
some
spiciness
imparted
by
the
belgian
yeast
the
taste
was
nicely
balanced
between
the
belgian
fruity
version
of
the
pale
ale
style
and
the
drier
american
ipa
variant
the
hops
were
present
but
subdued
and
some
brett
type
funk
was
evident
as
well
the
finish
started
dry
and
bitter
at
first
but
ended
on
a
sweeter
candi
sugar
and
some
spice
this
was
a
marriage
of
the
lighter
versions
of
the
two
styles
so
the
body
was
not
too
thick
i
ended
up
wishing
they
had
matched
up
the
ingredients
of
a
dipa
and
bspa
instead
all
the
bipas
i
have
tried
have
come
from
belgium
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
version
of
a
belgian
style
which
is
an
interpretation
of
an
american
style
thats
originally
an
english
style
recommended
this
beer
loses
on
drinkability
for
me
i
had
a
couple
glasses
of
water
before
drinking
this
beer
but
as
soon
as
i
finished
the
first
half
i
felt
completely
dried
out
i
dont
know
if
its
the
hops
or
the
malt
or
just
me
but
i
am
extremely
parched
after
drinking
this
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
offwhite
head
over
the
clear
burnished
golden
brew
head
lingers
nicely
with
average
to
good
lasting
lace
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
lightly
spicy
hoppiness
taste
is
also
sweet
with
spices
and
the
lightest
touch
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
everything
comes
together
nicely
and
while
its
not
in
your
face
i
dont
believe
that
was
the
intention
an
interesting
experiment
but
one
that
unfortunately
did
not
create
a
great
beer
imo
definitely
worth
checking
out
to
sate
the
curiosity
at
roughly
5
why
not
you
get
a
buzz
out
of
the
deal
however
this
will
not
be
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
i
enjoyed
it
but
im
not
completely
sold
worth
a
try
for
sure
taste
although
this
american
depiction
might
fall
a
few
feet
short
of
other
classic
belgian
examples
such
as
dobbelen
chouffe
this
is
an
excellent
depiction
of
a
classic
european
style
done
in
the
american
tradition
d
fairly
easy
drinker
here
pretty
smooth
brew
and
a
great
mix
of
malt
and
hops
clear
amber
with
a
two
finger
cream
color
head
still
a
small
layer
of
head
at
the
half
way
point
and
very
nice
fine
lacings
aroma
is
mostly
ripe
pear
with
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
bitter
citrus
hops
with
a
rich
malt
backing
carbonation
is
just
right
and
the
finish
is
bitter
and
dry
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
background
drinkability
is
limited
only
by
price
and
the
6
9
abv
the
belgian
yeast
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
tang
that
makes
this
ipa
more
interesting
than
most
drinkability
as
tasty
and
supremely
drinkable
as
the
original
though
i
dare
say
its
just
a
skosh
bit
better
than
the
standard
stone
ipa
overall
my
favorite
india
pale
ale
ever
released
by
the
stone
brewery
distinct
taste
smell
and
presence
would
buy
again
sticky
golden
pour
with
a
billowy
white
head
delicious
hop
aroma
with
a
pleasing
sweetness
reminds
me
of
my
beloved
houblon
taste
is
awesome
fresh
hoppy
and
sweet
a
belgian
ipa
seems
to
me
a
mix
of
a
tripel
and
an
intense
ipa
this
one
is
especially
delicious
mouthfeel
is
also
smooth
with
no
alcohol
bite
so
long
as
you
are
down
with
the
sweet
sticky
hop
goodness
youll
have
no
problem
putting
a
couple
of
these
away
a
repeat
purchase
for
certain
d
i
really
like
this
one
this
bomber
is
going
to
go
down
way
too
easily
for
sure
this
one
drinks
very
well
enjoyability
is
on
par
with
the
tap
experience
id
definitely
like
to
see
more
of
this
stuff
around
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
white
head
nice
lacing
sweet
sweet
pale
malt
aroma
with
a
citrusy
hop
presence
orange
peel
palate
is
filled
with
malt
very
very
sweet
perhaps
too
sweet
citrusy
hops
really
come
out
in
the
finish
bitter
and
dry
this
beer
for
me
is
best
described
as
a
beer
that
starts
like
a
triple
and
ends
like
an
ipa
this
beer
seems
to
have
two
distinct
phases
i
would
like
to
feel
as
though
everything
blended
together
for
a
more
consistently
balanced
taste
throughout
contrary
to
other
reviews
i
did
not
think
this
was
closer
to
the
ipa
end
of
the
spectrum
i
could
have
used
some
more
hops
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
sweet
upfront
poured
glass
nice
pale
color
yellow
orange
very
clear
smell
was
weak
hops
and
clove
a
little
to
simple
for
an
ipa
or
a
trippel
taste
was
kinda
a
mess
the
hop
bitterness
battled
the
sweet
maltyness
its
odd
le
freak
worked
for
me
while
this
didnt
meh
its
a
perfectly
ok
beer
just
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
for
interesting
concept
less
then
impressive
execution
overall
this
is
a
tasty
offering
from
stone
and
one
that
is
worth
a
shot
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
yet
another
excellent
beer
from
stone
it
is
definitely
worth
drinking
for
a
whole
evening
drinkability
definitely
could
have
a
few
of
these
this
beer
leaves
you
wanting
more
d
pretty
drinkable
with
a
manageable
abv
the
left
over
spice
and
bitterness
is
pretty
strong
but
not
too
much
d
this
one
went
down
very
easy
and
was
enjoyable
not
quite
a
hop
bomb
but
has
a
great
balance
to
it
impressed
surprised
happy
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
stone
ipa
but
the
belgian
yeasts
makes
this
one
deliciously
different
ultimately
delicious
and
enjoyable
i
definitely
plan
of
snagging
a
few
more
bottles
of
these
well
this
looks
identical
to
stone
ipa
light
orange
almost
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
immediately
different
still
very
hoppy
bubblegum
and
belgian
yeast
spicy
the
taste
is
bitter
hops
and
not
much
else
the
belgian
influence
is
very
subdued
this
was
interesting
and
ill
always
give
a
new
stone
beer
a
fair
shake
but
i
wont
be
returning
to
this
i
could
see
if
using
belgian
yeast
with
the
stone
ipa
recipe
made
for
a
good
beer
but
this
just
feels
like
a
cheap
gimmick
d
this
is
a
standout
brew
that
was
better
than
my
expectations
future
outlook
good
stuff
i
can
see
getting
this
again
quite
a
nice
drink
pours
an
amber
orange
color
body
small
creamy
snow
white

diminishing
fruity
hoppy
aroma
fruity
grapefruity
taste
some
hoppy

on
the
aftertaste
some

some

nice
taste
belgiany
and
hoppy
light
fruit
taste
maybe
pear
or
something
creamy
palate
d
i
could
easily
throw
back
one
too
many
of
these
this
is
a
great
beer
though
some
of
the
supporting
acts
are
not
that
great
ie
the
appearance
the
taste
however
is
very
good
and
id
recommend
drinkability
is
pretty
good
im
most
impressed
with
their
restraint
in
the
abv
its
plenty
big
enough
to
warm
your
cheeks
without
being
gratuitous
as
many
west
coast
ipas
are
especially
stone
on
the
other
hand
this
was
so
limited
that
i
suppose
getting
a
bit
extra
punch
out
of
my
only
bottle
wouldnt
have
hurt
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
have
wanted
to
sacrifice
the
cleaner
alcoholic
taste
if
you
love
stones
ipa
you
will
love
this
and
while
i
like
the
more
overt
west
coast
influence
its
still
not
my
favorite
a
relatively
sweet
hoppy
beer
that
proves
to
be
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
flavor
to
allow
the
facilitation
of
multiple
pints
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
stone
brewery
and
was
very
pleased
with
the
fresh
hop
aroma
followed
by
a
sweet
malty
finish
great
ipa
service
at
the
brewery
was
mediocre
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
almost
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
is
good
and
there
is
a
lot
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
citrusy
hops
grapefruit
orange
ginger
belgian
yeast
and
a
bit
of
piney
hops
it
tastes
like
bready
malt
pine
and
citrusy
hops
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
belgian
yeast
peppery
spice
and
ginger
theres
good
balance
in
this
beer
its
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
bitter
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
with
the
relatively
low
abv
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
couple
bombers
of
this
at
all
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
the
vertical
epic
080808
i
just
drank
but
i
think
this
is
a
bit
better
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
you
should
d
i
love
stone
and
this
is
another
reason
why
buy
drink
repeat
brightlight
mouth
feel
and
fairly
light
body
fantastic
drinkability
i
enjoy
this
one
quite
a
bit
d
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
notes
glad
that
i
tried
this
it
was
better
than
i
thought
another
good
offering
from
stone
think
this
is
a
fine
combination
of
the
08
08
08
and
the
stone
ipa
i
tend
to
dislike
belgian
ipas
but
this
one
was
by
far
my
favorite
one
to
date
i
really
love
west
coast
ipas
but
sometimes
i
just
tend
to
get
burned
out
on
drinking
them
on
the
other
hand
i
really
dont
care
for
belgian
ipas
because
they
seem
too
reserved
this
one
fits
right
in
the
middle
a
perfect
blend
of
both
characteristics
this
was
more
of
a
belgium
pale
ale
than
a
bipa
way
overpriced
stone
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
pours
clear
orangegold
with
a
big
pillowy
white
head
bubble
gum
clove
orange
peel
and
peaches
in
the
aroma
strange
but
good
taste
up
front
like
a
very
bitter
trippel
more
bubblegum
and
spice
but
dry
white
pepper
and
pine
are
right
there
with
it
the
beer
sweetens
as
it
warms
and
your
palate
adjusts
more
pine
and
spicy
hops
come
out
and
mix
well
with
the
belgian
sweetness
much
better
than
le
chouffe
or
one
of
the
other
belgian
ipas
lovely
all
around
i
heart
stone
and
this
is
no
exception
stones
got
a
winner
here
i
dont
like
it
quite
as
much
as
their
ipa
but
this
is
well
done
given
i
believe
the
look
here
could
be
improved
a
little
perhaps
by
not
looking
so
filtered
a
tad
more
hop
bitterness
might
improve
the
flavor
as
well
otherwise
this
is
extremely
impressive
and
stones
ipa
recipe
works
very
well
with
belgian
yeast
highly
recommended
if
you
have
the
opportunity
thanks
cannabanaceae
for
the
opportunity
a
dry
brew
with
a
high
amount
of
hop
the
aftertaste
is
longlasting
bitter
hop
relatively
thin
body
with
an
above
average
level
of
carbonation
lip
puckeringly
astringent
pours
a
completely
clear
orange
amber
with
a
thin
creme
head
nose
is
perfume
and
floral
tones
flavor
comes
off
as
the
skins
of
some
fruit
to
me
grapefruits
i
think
i
dont
like
to
eat
grapefruit
skins
and
i
dont
really
want
to
drink
them
theres
also
a
bitter
acidic
bite
from
too
much
hops
i
am
guessing
earthy
dirt
aftertaste
a
bit
carbonation
is
slightly
aggressive
and
the
liquid
is
smooth
overall
this
is
a
below
par
belgian
ipa
imo
the
hops
are
too
prevalent
to
let
the
belgian
ale
side
shine
and
it
doesnt
have
the
balance
i
would
seek
out
from
this
style
the
drinkability
is
solid
is
doesnt
bowl
you
over
with
bitterness
like
it
could
its
actually
pretty
balanced
the
smooth
sweet
complex
taste
is
a
new
take
on
the
recent
belgian
ipa
trend
and
while
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
its
already
nice
to
see
a
little
something
different
than
a
hoppy
tripel
which
this
is
not
well
worth
a
try
i
would
be
happy
to
see
this
one
return
next
year
drinkability
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
had
makes
you
want
to
guzzle
it
going
to
buy
another
one
or
two
on
my
way
home
for
sd
tomorrow
d
jammed
this
with
some
jimmy
durante
and
it
seemed
to
couple
very
nicely
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
reminded
me
just
a
tad
of
the
08
08
08
overall
a
very
nice
beer
comes
with
the
usual
stone
reading
material
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
even
at
6
99
it
was
worth
a
whirl
the
ipa
portion
is
definitely
flavorful
but
the
belgian
yeast
and
sweetness
hamper
these
highlights
glad
that
i
tried
this
offering
but
next
time
ill
order
a
ruination
instead
d
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
is
clean
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
seems
very
well
done
for
the
style
and
i
wouldnt
have
any
problems
having
a
couple
more
pints
of
the
calibelgique
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
off
but
not
enough
to
mess
up
the
beer
as
a
whole
another
good
brew
from
stone
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
i
bought
the
first
bottle
i
saw
in
oh
6
99
at
whole
foods
the
beer
is
yellow
as
corn
but
clear
as
water
thick
white
foamy
head
that
laces
dry
onto
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
nearperfect
coupling
of
west
coast
hops
with
belgian
yeast
the
citrus
from
the
hops
and
the
esters
from
the
yeast
the
taste
is
likewise
representative
of
both
styles
much
better
suited
to
my
tastes
than
the
belgian
ipas
ive
tried
in
the
past
urthel
hopit
chouffe
tripel
ipa
etc
lots
of
grapefruit
with
spiciness
and
cloves
very
tasty
a
real
winner
from
stone
finish
is
toastybiscuity
also
with
again
more
fruit
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
ruined
for
me
due
to
an
astringent
minty
flavor
this
beer
is
simply
not
brewed
to
my
taste
this
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
color
and
formed
an
off
white
foamy
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
is
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
hops
and
belgian
yeasts
the
flavor
was
of
hops
citrus
pine
and
hints
of
the
yeast
as
well
the
body
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
sprite
and
peppery
another
nice
experiment
from
stone
the
mouthfeel
is
exactly
what
i
would
want
out
of
a
belgian
ipa
lively
medium
bodied
and
with
great
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
very
high
here
everything
is
in
perfect
balance
and
the
abv
is
almost
at
a
sessionable
level
i
would
love
to
drink
these
all
night
long
really
an
amazing
beer
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
and
one
where
the
aroma
belied
the
amount
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
taste
an
original
and
tasty
beer
from
stone
medium
body
with
active
carbonation
yet
i
feel
something
lacking
in
the
mouthfeel
perhaps
its
the
lack
of
time
that
it
spends
in
your
mouth
im
not
quite
sure
overall
tasty
and
easy
too
drink
with
the
alcohol
lurking
somewhere
pretty
good
brew
d
nice
brew
and
well
worth
getting
a
typically
good
brew
from
a
good
brewery
i
love
this
style
mostly
clear
bright
golden
with
a
slight
haze
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
tall
soapy
creamwhite
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
nicely
the
aroma
is
the
highlight
of
this
beer
distinctly
belgian
yeast
with
floral
hops
and
fruit
namely
grapefruit
and
pear
taste
starts
with
yeast
and
an
almost
sweet
tart
flavor
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
finish
hits
you
with
a
bold
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
while
then
slowly
dies
off
leaving
you
with
a
hint
of
sweet
fruit
a
great
variation
of
one
of
the
classic
ipas
overall
the
combo
of
ipa
and
belgian
yeast
didnt
really
make
a
perfect
complex
blend
this
combo
was
just
good
but
the
beer
was
good
by
itself
and
i
liked
it
for
that
i
would
have
again
if
it
was
brewed
again
and
i
could
find
it
if
calibelgique
ipa
is
an
experiment
then
its
a
successful
experiment
by
virtue
of
one
simple
change
greg
and
the
boys
at
stone
have
managed
to
create
an
ipa
that
tastes
nothing
like
the
original
yet
is
just
as
good
if
the
suggestion
box
is
open
heres
a
vote
for
continued
production
distribution
to
iowa
is
probably
a
pipe
dream
but
then
thats
why
i
look
forward
to
traveling
back
to
ohio
several
times
each
year
as
this
warms
up
over
an
hour
its
quite
remarkable
how
the
balance
shifts
in
this
beer
from
being
hopdriven
to
yeastdriven
all
told
its
still
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
emerging
styles
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
chimay
tripel
character
but
sweeter
with
a
more
caramel
cotton
candylike
confection
a
bit
darker
coppergolden
than
most
tripels
but
this
one
also
gives
a
light
toastytoffee
note
that
balances
the
fruity
esters
and
spicy
phenols
well
the
strong
hop
flavors
compliment
the
peppery
clovey
yeasty
spices
very
well
with
a
sharp
citrus
chaitea
herbalness
that
never
wavers
from
the
other
complex
tripellike
notes
evaporative
feel
to
the
mouth
from
the
dry
hops
minty
alcohols
and
efforvescent
carbonation
the
beer
just
lifts
off
of
the
toung
and
dries
out
in
the
finish
for
superb
drinking
enjoyment
finishes
spicy
citrusy
and
with
a
mild
phenolicsoapy
note
that
i
pick
out
in
most
all
hoppy
belgians
not
quite
a
houblon
chouffe
but
very
close
in
quality
drinkability
nice
and
really
does
add
a
whole
new
element
to
the
stone
ipa
and
everything
works
really
well
in
my
opinion
with
the
exception
of
that
dry
hopping
which
just
sort
of
seems
well
off
the
alcohol
is
like
the
stone
ipa
just
fine
well
hidden
and
of
a
reasonable
level
the
aroma
is
out
of
this
world
the
rest
is
just
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
still
a
great
beer
and
one
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
maybe
tweaking
the
regular
stone
ipa
recipe
a
little
for
its
belgification
would
yield
a
slightly
improved
taste
m
d
a
nice
shimmering
carbonation
giving
to
it
the
bit
of
a
foamy
mouthfeel
that
i
appreciate
a
solid
brew
the
standard
stone
ipa
would
be
more
likely
to
be
a
regular
offering
in
my
fridge
but
this
one
is
a
nice
treat
22
oz
bomber
from
south
bay
drugs
pours
a
fairly
standard
golden
orange
but
with
a
nice
head
thatsticks
around
as
a
cap
its
amazing
what
the
adddition
of
a
different
yeast
will
do
i
like
stone
ipa
quite
a
bit
and
i
like
this
as
well
but
the
addition
of
belgian
yeast
to
the
ipa
has
yielded
an
entirely
different
beer
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
bready
and
meaty
almost
of
bacon
there
are
the
standard
stone
ipa
hop
flavors
of
citrus
and
lingering
piney
bitterness
but
this
bacony
breadiness
with
some
tangy
notes
overlies
that
unusual
and
takes
a
bit
of
getting
used
to
but
i
like
it
pretty
drinkable
even
though
flavor
is
its
weak
point
not
that
it
tastes
bad
at
it
is
just
light
dry
and
refresh
not
complex
pretty
much
i
beer
i
will
try
every
year
it
comes
out
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
two
inch
white
fluffy
head
smells
of
sweet
grapefruit
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
very
citrusy
with
grapefruit
and
a
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
has
a
light
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
is
a
little
chewy
drinkability
is
very
good
i
had
no
problem
finishing
this
bomber
overall
a
great
beer
from
stone
all
in
all
this
was
a
decent
attempt
for
stone
at
what
is
at
least
partially
a
belgian
beer
considering
the
disappointment
of
most
of
the
vertical
epic
series
this
was
actually
almost
a
step
up
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
it
to
be
anything
close
to
a
choffe
houblon
this
is
definitely
not
my
style
that
being
said
if
you
like
strongly
spiced
beers
youll
enjoy
this
one
i
would
attempt
to
describe
the
spice
but
i
dislike
this
one
so
much
i
dont
care
to
try
tasty
of
the
three
recent
hoppy
belgians
from
stone
this
one
is
the
the
biggest
all
around
the
ve
08
is
the
most
subdued
with
the
hops
followed
by
the
collaboration
and
then
this
one
on
tap
at
the
ba
belgian
fest
yesterday
and
reviewed
based
on
notes
pours
lighter
amber
clear
under
an
initially
fluffy
and
dense
off
white
head
i
got
resiny
hops
some
lime
in
the
nose
fruity
hoppy
yeast
going
on
here
complex
tasty
offering
i
love
the
regular
stone
ipa
love
the
belgian
addition
so
enjoying
this
one
is
a
no
brainer
id
love
to
see
this
one
in
bottles
locally
sometime
soon
d
a
good
fall
brew
the
spice
is
making
me
think
of
the
coming
holidayswhere
did
the
year
go
dug
it
thanks
greg
co
i
will
be
buying
again
it
may
not
be
up
my
particular
alley
but
i
recognize
the
artistry
in
the
mixing
of
styles
md
the
beer
is
on
the
lighter
side
overall
which
is
nice
nothing
too
overwhelming
in
texture
even
at
almost
7
still
this
isnt
my
favorite
type
of
beer
as
the
belgian
yeast
character
takes
some
getting
use
to
along
with
a
huge
hop
presence
quite
good
still
something
different
when
us
west
coasters
want
to
go
for
something
a
bit
different
overall
just
try
it
d
very
good
beer
ill
have
this
one
again
poured
a
very
bright
orange
color
with
a
white
head
smells
like
citrus
and
yeast
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
balanced
but
still
very
yeasty
with
a
citrus
kick
i
thought
it
was
a
little
tart
at
the
end
drinkability
is
low
just
strange
but
good
this
beer
was
really
good
and
i
was
lucky
to
get
it
on
tap
i
thought
stone
was
slipping
as
of
late
but
this
gives
me
hope
that
every
once
in
a
while
a
brewery
just
goofs
very
good
beer
the
french
at
the
end
of
the
blurb
on
the
back
is
grammatically
incorrect
a
unique
interesting
brew
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
very
impressed
with
this
brew
on
at
sd
toronado
like
its
labeled
very
ca
and
belg
big
dose
of
pine
resin
sap
hops
are
nice
and
the
mid
doenst
go
so
belgium
aged
hop
sweet
but
still
has
a
hint
of
it
and
the
great
texture
would
this
possibly
age
complex
nose
and
maybe
the
carbination
was
a
bit
high
nice
complexity
and
mission
accomplished
as
it
felt

ca
and
belg
sorry
i
appreciate
experimentation
and
give
them
credit
for
that
but
as
a
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
i
just
couldnt
do
it
in
the
end
i
did
toss
about
13
of
the
bottle
such
a
waste
d
this
is
a
tasty
beer
thats
very
easy
to
drink
the
6
9
isnt
even
a
factor
in
this
category
purchase
22oz
bottle
from
south
bay
drugs
imperial
beach
ca
d
an
interesting
beer
but
in
the
end
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
it
i
didnt
think
the
flavours
blended
well
enough
together
and
the
hop
character
got
unappetizingly
bitter
after
a
while
a
nice
experiment
i
could
see
myself
trying
it
again
but
wont
be
a
go
to
beer
from
stone
interesting
variation
on
the
formula
but
not
a
beer
i
would
nominate
for
continued
production
decent
mouthfeel
nothing
too
much
to
say
about
this
really
d
i
cant
say
that
thhis
is
my
favorite
special
release
from
stone
but
this
si
certainly
drinkable
but
this
tastes
more
like
a
blended
beer
that
sits
side
by
side
wih
itself
in
your
glass
cheers
on
another
great
beer
stone
pours
a
clear
orange
nice
looking
chunky
but
thin

refreshing
aroma
taste
is

and
that
bubblegum
banana
floral
nice
bit
of
light
fruits
pretty
standard
fare
but
well
done
the
spicy
bitter
finish
is
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
goes
down
easy
not
too
bad
id
drink
this
one
again
overall
yummy
beer
note
this
is
not
the
collaboration
brew
that
was
produced
with
alesmith
and
mikeller
which
is
a
belgian
tripel
ipa
taste
smooth
fruity
you
can
taste
the
hops
and
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
but
they
are
nice
and
balanced

but
not
very
much
bitterness
also
some
clove
spiciness
dry
medium

smooth

love
stone

so
i
was
expecting
something
big
from
this
and
was
not
disappointed
reminded
me
of
hoppy
belgian
pale
until
it
warmed
and
i
could
really
taste
the
piney
hops
will
drink
again
recommended
note
these
notes
are
from
memory
had
this
wonderful
brew
earlier
today
at
the
brewery
not
my
fave
edit
looking
back
at
this
review
a
4
0
for
taste
was
too
generous
horrible
tincan
metallic
smell
and
somewhat
taste
despite
coming
from
a
bottle
the
hops
are
dominant
in
the
aroma
a
mixture
of
floral
and
grass
accents
it
pours
a
nice
golden
beer
with
a
white
head
that
vanishes
rapidly
the
hops
dominate
the
taste
which
makes
it
a
medium
bitter
beer
the
texture
of
the
beer
is
thin
and
the
initial
hop
accents
are
completely
absent
in
the
finishing
overall
a
nice
beer
which
tastes
better
if
you
drink
it
slightly
warmer
than
the
recommended
serving
temperature
not
a
fan
of
the
smell
or
taste

on

as
a
huge
unibroue
fin
du
monde
fan
i
like
this
very
much
lacks
the
bready
unibroue
yeast
but
that
just
adds
to
the
mystery
if
it
wasnt
for
the

abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
in
any
season
love
it
hits
you
with
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
fruity
but
not
overly
sweet
nice
carbonation
peppery
finish
fairly
bitter
but
not
overpowering
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
drinkable
but
complex
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
would
drink
again
for
sure
belgian
golden
strong
ale
brewed
with
5
different
hop
varietals
for
complex
flavor
and
refined
body
strong
bitter
blonde
the
created
for
the
brewers
wedding
celebration
so
tasty
from
large
corked
bottle
clear
light
gold
with
good
retention
on
creamy
white
head
smell
is
dry
and
grassy
some
fruity
cherries
a
bit
spicy
with
some
yeasty
character
over
a
firm
malt
base
taste
is
fruity
but
also
distinctly
yeasty
and
mild
kilned
belgian
malts
toasty
with
some
dry
bitterness
hops
arent
very
lively
grassy
and
earthy
not
bad
but
not
an
outstandingly
complex
beer
this
is
not
a
beer
for
me
but
still
i
can
apreciate
the
experience
if
you
like
bitter
this
might
be
the
beer
for
you
theres
nothing
sacred
about
definition
you
can
define
any
style
for
your
own
purpose
provided
you
do
so
clearly
and
unambiguously
in
the
case
of
belgian
ipas
distinguished
by
their
use
of
belgian
yeast
strains
i
think
its
pretty
selfexplanatory
what
to
expect
hopus
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
far
from
the
best
o
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
i
like
the
bitter
finish
and
i
found
it
incredibly
easy
to
drink
to
me
the
idea
of
a
belgian
ipa
is
confusing
perhaps
this
is
a
bspa
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
bottles
i
will
enjoy
it
again
overall
a
little
unrefined
at
times
and
a
touch
medicinal
but
still
a
pretty
solid
beer
not
something
id
pick
up
again
though
something
about
it
just
tastes
a
little
home
brewish
far
too
many
other
beers
available
to
come
back
to
this
one
overall
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
more
bitter
beers
from
belgium
ive
tried
that
being
said
the
focus
still
seems
a
bit
heavy
on
the
malt
flavors
which
do
make
for
a
quality
beer
enjoy
overall
a
passable
belgian
ipa
but
this
to
me
is
more
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
a
belgian
ipa
still
worth
a
try
while
quantities
last
d
a
decent
beer
although
it
is
a
little
overpriced
could
use
a
little
less
sweetness
i
think
and
some
more
complex
balance
good
though
but
an
also
ran
for
beers
in
the
style
the
beer
was
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
glass
lots
of
carbonation
visible
the
beer
looks
okay
like
a
bit
yelloworange
the
smell
is
awesome
very
rich
with
lots
of
hints
of
spices
the
taste
was
a
bit
disappointing
not
very
rich
and
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
good
when
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
if
you
dont
swallow
too
quickly
the
taste
becomes
more
complex
overall
not
a
bad
beer
o
with
its
aromas
and
flavors
of
candi
sugars
i
thought
that
this
beer
shared
a
lot
of
similarities
with
a
dubbel
except
that
it
also
had
some
spices
and
bitterness
mo
the
mouthfeel
is
kept
smooth
creamy
and
consistently
finely
carbonated
the
body
comes
full
but
not
heavy
while
the
spicyyeasty
feel
and
hop
bitterness
plus
resins
combine
to
deliver
an
altogether
chewy
feel
hoppy
as
it
tries
to
be
the
estery
elements
in
the
beer
still
play
a
very
important
role
esp
on
the
nose
while
on
the
palate
the
hop
elements
add
more
complexity
and
enjoyment
esp
in
the
aftertaste
where
yeasts
and
hops
converge
to
deliver
a
palate
ideal
for
anyone
who
appreciates
belgian
yeasty
magic
and
hop
consolidation
at
the
same
time
personally
i
think
this
is
a
nicely
hoppy
belgian
ale
with
a
decent
balance
and
evolving
flavour
profile
to
savour
if
fixed
at
a
lower
gravity
this
beer
couldve
been
even
quaffable
overall
not
very
good
seems
like
some
off
flavors
and
not
very
hoppy
for
a
beer
called
hopus
pours
a
murky
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
grape
juice
spice
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
grape
juice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
displays
more
fruit
and
spice
aromas
and
flavors
over
any
sort
of
hop
presence
this
beer
is
supposed
to
have
overall
maybe
i
misinterpreted
the
name
along
with
the
phrase
5
sorts
of
hops
and
in
my
head
i
had
it
as
something
very
hoppy
surely
above
average
at
the
end
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
a
typical
example
of
a
belgian
ale
very
good
very
easily
drinkable
especially
since
the
alcohol
is
just
a
tiny
bit
traceable
and
very
tasty
tasty
and
wellcrafted
it
certainly
isnt
a
belgian
ipa
more
of
a
strong
pale
ale
although
the
hops
are
a
tad
more
distinctive
compared
with
your
typical
belgian
beer
they
are
grassy
and
herbal
while
adding
a
delicate
bitterness
hopus
is
no
hop
bomb
with
that
said
it
has
a
balanced
yeasty
character
fleshed
out
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
some
serious
booze
perfect
for
appreciating
the
relative
subtleties
of
belgian
brewing
it
goes
down
nicely
worth
sampling
if
you
chance
across
it
bottle
poured
a
dirty
beige
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
dry
hoppy
notes
with
a
light
belgian
style
malt
backbone
taste
is
a
solid
mix
between
some
hoppy
dry
herbal
notes
with
some
floral
notes
sustain
by
a
solid
belgianstyle
malt
backbone
with
limited
sweetness
body
is
quite
full
with
great
bottle
conditioning
and
no
apparent

i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
really
liked
the
dry
floral
and
herbal
notes
coming
from
the
hops
o
an
ale
from
belgium
to
revisit
again
easy
to
drink
and
with
personality
o
are
they
hyping
the
hops
to
appeal
to
an
american
market
dominated
by
ipas
this
is
a
belgian
beer
all
the
way
and
a
great
one
at
that
overall

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
pieces
of
it
were
great
it
is
not
however
a
belgian
ipa
so
much
as
a
notably
hoppy
somewhat
farmhousey
strong
pale
which
i
digi
love
all
of
those
elements
actually
it
doesnt
quite
pop
with
this
one
i
think
de
graal
triverius
nails
that
particular
profile
but
i
enjoyed
it
all
the
same
and
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
sure
even
though
it
was
slightly
off
it
had
enough
sweet
malts
and
mild
hops
to
help
pull
through
the
whole
glass
id
like
to
try
this
one
fresh
none
of
the
belgian
india
pale
ales
are
really
hoppy
in
the
american
sense
but
this
one
has
some
tang
to
it
pours
a
little
hazy
bright
golden
color
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
lasting
head
smells
like
bready
yeast
english
caramel
malts
in
a
refined
form
and
something
more
than
kent
goldings
on
the
hop
front
not
a
beast
but
a
bigger
on
the
hop
belgian
the
booze
is
absent
in
the
taste
which
is
surprising
you
can
really
feel
it
the
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
nose
with
a
crisp
aftertaste
great
feel
bright
bubbles
and
cold
clean
finish
not
my
favorite
belgian
but
a
nice
take
on
this
style
and
a
beer
i
will
definitely
drink
again
here
in
europe
this
is
as
hoppy
as
ive
been
able
to
find
in

the

pours
a
cloudy

golden
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
head
excellent
retention
and
some
lacing
the
nose
is
peculiar
yet
nice
blends
of
belgian
yeast
hints
of
dark
fruit
almost
wild
character
the
flavor
is
equally
distinct
mild
caramel
malt
base
provides
a
mild
sweetness
from
which
the
light
belgian
yeast
builds
hints
of
banana
and
apples
mildly
bitter
more
fruity
finishes
with
a
hint
of
tart
odd
flavor
for
a
belgian

but
not
bad
at
all
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
the
beer
finishes
dry

smooth
overall
an
interesting
beer
not
as
hoppy

i

pleasant
a
great

all

this
is
a
good
beer
but
with
a
misleading
label
this
beer
is
not
hoppy
at
all
o
a
great
beer
that
im
glad
i
took
the
chance
and
grabbed
one
out
of
the
blue
i
definitely
would
have
scored
it
higher
had
the
pour
not
been
so
disgusting
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
one
but
it
sure
didnt
hurt
the
taste
o
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
that
is
neither
too
hoppy
nor
too
sweet
too
dry
nor
too
slick
too
strong
nor
too
weak
a
very
admirable
effort
from
lefebvre
overall
reasonable
commercialized
beer
okay
but
not
impressive
great
beer
served
with
a
big
foamy
frothy
fluffy
off
white
head
that
is
long
lasting
and
clumpy
lace
color
was
a
clear
dark
gold
amber
nose
is
malt
grain
leather
yeast
sweat
flavor
has
bitterness
stand
out
and
sweetness
is
almost
gone
to
the
point
of
dryness
not
much
flavor
or
aroma
hop
malt
flavor
is
subdued
but
unmalted
grain
is
there
plus
grass
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
long
and
a
little
warm
id
like
another
please
still
my
first
belgian
ipa
m
very
nice
poured
out
as
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
w
decent
looking
head
on
top
the
head
was
a
little
sticky
and
left
a
pretty
good
lacing
for
a
while
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
earthy
yeasty
and
a
little
hoppy
the
hops
dont
jump
out
at
you
too
much
on
this
one
the
taste
has
a
nice
spicy
hop
flavor
to
it
along
with
some
nice
belgian
tripel
flavors
too
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
and
seems
to
be
well
balances
in
my
opinion
overall
i
like
it
its
not
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
but
i
did
enjoy
trying
it
it
doesnt
have
too
strong
of
a
finish
so
its
quite
nice
ill
drink
this
again
if
i
happened
to
have
a
chance
the
only
drawback
is
its
a
bit
more
pricey
than
im
accustomed
to
or
did
the
bar
overcharge
me
o
decent
belgian
ipa
has
a
nice
balanced
flavor
and
aroma
o
reminds
me
of
a
saison
farmhouse
ale
o
this
was
a
total
blind
buy
for
my
first
purchase
in
belgium
i
tired
finding
something
a
similar
to
what
im
used
to
back
home
in
seattle
before
branching
out
nice
combination
of
a
belgian
ale
with
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavor
from
a
typical
ipa
o
my
friend
picked
this
one
out
for
me
when
he
came
to
a
bottle
shop
with
me
im
pretty
sure
the
swing
top
had
some
influence
this
brew
is
not
bad
and
surprising
while
lacking
the
pleasant
part
more
hops
are
needed
for
sure
lose
some
sweet
fruit
or
add
some
malt
but
other
than
that
not
bad
i
feel
it
could
be
enjoyed
more
with
a
very
sharp
cheese
that
doesnt
fuck
around
worth
a
shot
rather
sure
i
will
never
have
this
again
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better

the

is
tart

funky
like
a

hoppy

german

czech
style
not
so
american
and
oily

still

of
the
best
mouthfeels
of
all

on
this
one
this
beers
best
feature
amongst
many
i
love
the
expansive
decadent
richness
but
the
lightness
and
sessionability
too
this
is
everything
one
could
hope
for
in
a

and
more
complex

special
well
hopped
and
gorgeous
in

hops
are
relatively
light

present
enough
to
leave

bitterness
throughout
the
taste
otherwise
pleasant
belgian

taste
with
some
fruity
esters
including
a
bit
of
banana
these
flavors
seem
like
they

than
they
do

overall
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
and
after
a
few
days
in

the

bitterness
is
much
appreciated

a
very
unique
and
hoppy
beer
with
intensive
flavors
but
not
heavily
bitter
a
mix
of
tripel
and
ipa
worth
it
a
try
the
taste
largely
follows
although
it
has
more
flavor
and
more
yeast
than
the
nose
suggests
despite
the
name
the
hops
do
not
dominate
but
are
in
good
balance
with
the
other
flavor
components
othis
is
an
enjoyable
drinkable
ipa
with
lots
of
complexity
and
balance
it
is
unique
among
belgians
i
think
for
the
citrusy
almost
tropical
hop
profile
flavors
are
big
but
the
bitterness
is
very
mild
it
also
earns
high
marks
for
the
great
head
and
waves
of
sticky
thick
lacing
mf
a
delicate
medium
bodied
beer
a
champagnelike
feel
with
a
dry
finish
overall
i
have
not
had
many
belgian
ipas
so
i
was
not
quite
sure
what
to
expect
here
but
it
turned
out
to
be
absolutely
delicious
and
is
certainly
a
beer
i
will
be
buying
again
all
in
all
a
great
belgian
ipa
the
taste
is
plenty
sweet
and
plenty
malty
with
a
citrus
fruit
and
a
low
to
moderate
lingering
bitterness
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
might
have
liked
but
delightful
in
its
own
way
o
a
bitter
beer
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
flavor
and
aroma
this
bottle
seems
like
it
might
be
a
bit
older
but
far
from
flat
old
hops
character
additionally
this
would
probably
still
be
an
excellent
beer
even
if
it
had
been
aged
id
just
be
approaching
it
more
like
a
triple
than
an
ipa
style
o
damn
this
is
good
stuff
its
exactly
what
i
expected
it
to
be
a
rocksolid
bspa
with
an
extra
helping
of
hops
this
could
have
the
potential
to
be
amazing
fresh
overall
impression
a
very
quaffable
belgian
ipa
whose
body
and
flavor
belie
its
8
0
abv
playful
hop
and
yeast
character
contribute
to
make
an
overall
great
ale
that
said
it
looks
awesome
after
pour
smells
very
nice
tastes
pretty
good
even
when
considering
my
uncertain
feelings
and
is
worth
having
again
id
like
to
try
the
rest
of
their
line
up
o
excellent
brew
big
head
great
flavors
and
excellent
aftertaste
the
fizziness
with
the
strong
bitter
beginning
make
this
an
aggressive
ale
enjoyable
but
be
ready
for
it
overall
pretty
solid
belgian
ipa
and
the
alcohol
is
not
even
noticeable
too
nice
completion
of
their
whole
lineup
overall
a
pretty
decent
belgian
ipa
that
is
rather
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
if
you
like
hops
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
o
very
drinkable
authentic
belgian
ipa
recommended
very
good
combined
with
french
cheese
calvados
brie
both
cheese
and
beer
lose
a
bit
of
theit
bitterness
if
combined
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
where
the
hops
really
come
forward
its
not
all
that
bitter
but
what
bitterness
is
there
hang
on
and
gets
more
pronounced
as
you
swallow
i
actually
like
the
aftertaste
so
much
i
dont
want
to
take
another
drink
but
i
will
because
the
flavor
here
is
good
when
we
were
in
belgium
i
had
a
couple
of
beers
from
het
anker
our
next
trip
will
be
during
belgian
beer
weekend
and
we
will
just
chug
beers
like
this
we
have
an
extra
week
of
vacation
this
year
maybe
we
will
go
to
belgium
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
recently
a
really
solid
take
on
the
bipa
style
with
plenty
of
juicey
hops
pretty
mild
bitterness
and
a
nice
overall
feel
to
it
really
tasty
try
it
out
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
patches
of
foam
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
fruits
and
some
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
malty
finish
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
thought
to
myself
what
the
heck
is
gouden
doing
making
an
ipa
their
lineup
is
so
solid
but
this
excellent
brew
reminds
us
to
keep
an
open
mind
great
creative
people
always
see
something
new
and
exciting
just
over
the
horizon
this
is
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
initial
taste
great
spices
properly
infused
look
on
the
wheat
beer
side
smell
and
finish
clean
and
crisp
and
makes
for
an
oh
so
interesting
pleasure
good
surprise
find
and
more
than
well
worth
a
try
the
spice
and
floral
nectary
hops
go
together
like
love
and
marriage
pb
and
j
well
you
get
the
point
this
is
just
a
well
crafted
belgian
ipa
that
isnt
over
the
top
cheers
o
an
enjoyable
brew
from
our
belgian
friends
at
brouwerij
i
feel
as
if
this
is
a
bit
off
of
my
particular
tastes
although
for
a
bitter
hop
explosion
on
a
belgian
base
this
is
an
exquisite
brew
o
this
was
actually
the
fist
time
ive
ever
had
this
one
and
it
definitely
wont
be
the
last
o
maybe
not
a
game
changer
but
easily
a
solid
go
to
if
ou
can
find
it
there
are
an
increasing
amount
of
new
takes
on
the
bipa
style
but
this
is
a
classic
example
quality
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
in
terms
of
taste
and
thats
what
counts
its
light
yet
complex
which
is
something
that
ive
rarely
seen
made
doable
i
think
no
matter
who
you
are
you
will
like
this
beer
o
on
the
whole
a
well
made
drinkable
beer

great

i
am

never
had

one
glad
ive
got
more
than
one
of
this
one
cheers
all
a
must
try
if
you
like
hops
overall
a
really
nice
belgian
ipa
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
light
malts
and
a
nice
strain
of
belgian
yeast
i
like
this
a
lot
and
would
happily
buy
more
again
d
wonderfully
easy
to
enjoy
o
all
i
can
say
is
wow
a
big
surprise
from
a
brewery
that
i
havent
been
particularly
impressed
with
in
the
past
excluding
gulden
draak
has
all
of
the
best
qualities
of
the
style
and
very
little
defects
well
worth
seeking
out
classic
belgian
golden
ale
well
done
o
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
the
strongly
oxidized
aroma
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
but
it
still
tastes
pretty
decent
a
wellmade
and
enjoyable
beer
from
brouwerij
het
anker
overall
tastes
like
an
american
ipa
belgian
funkiness
missing
i
still
like
it
o
very
good
bipa
that
i
would
recommend
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
good
not
totally
a
dry
crisp
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
belgian
ipa
but
its
still
a
good
drink
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
an
8
beer
nevertheless
this
one
offers
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
without
the
fruity
complexity
head
retention
and
appearance
overall
are
also
just
not
up
to
stuff
solid
but
all
things
considered
pretty
average
for
the
style
o
a
great
surprise
i
was
not
expecting
this
from
this
delightful
hidden
brew
im
shocked
this
brew
is
my
first
from
gc
yum
ok
so
i
just
happened
to
notice
this
variety
4
pack
from
belgium
that
looked
interesting
trying
the
belgian
ipa
first
well
things
didnt
start
out
too
well
what
with
about
90
of
my
tulip
glass
being
filled
up
with
foam
once
i
worked
it
out
it
looks
pretty
nice
with
the
more
acceptable
head
on
top
of
a
light
very
hazy
body
i
dig
the
smell
kind
of
hard
to
describe
but
it
has
a
tangy
yeasty
hops
smell
pretty
strong
aroma
i
like
the
taste
hops
but
with
that
crisp
light
taste
that
i
associate
with
european
brews
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
seems
very
carbonoted
whether
it
is
or
not
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
styles
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
huge
dense
head
aroma
is
tropical
fruit
and
a
sugary
sweetness
which
does
not
manifest
itself
in
the
flavor
this
bottle
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
a
few
months
so
it
does
not
really
have
a
huge
hop
nose
like
a
fresh
example
would
the
strong
point
of
this
beer
is
the
ultradry
mouthfeel
which
leaves
an
impression
very
much
like
a
saison
this
is
a
lovely
beer
not
the
best
that
het
anker
has
to
offer
but
quite
good
overall
big
let
down
on
both
taste
and
the
wallet
o
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
it
tastes
much
better
than
their
tripel
and
has
true
belgian
character
which
a
lot
of
the
american
breweries
versions
of
belgian
ipas
dont
seem
to
be
able
to
pull
off
yet
overall
iam
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
since
the
nose
is
so
fantastic
unfortunately
the
beer
just
did
not
pull
it
off
jd
it
has
merits
in
the
aroma
and
visuals
too
golden
and
capped
with
white
foam
in
its
gilded
cup
it
was
a
site
to
behold
the
smell
showed
off
the
scents
of
typical
belgian
pale
beers
and
some
european
saaz
hops
carbonation
seems
a
bit
high
this
is
a
belgian
hop
bomb
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
if
the
alcohol
werent
so
apparent
hopsinjoor
would
rate
higher
o
a
tasty
belgian
ipa
and
offering
up
some
unique
flavours
the
high
abv
was
well
hidden
making
it
easily
drinkable
i
would
buy
this
again
o
a
nice
light
beer
very
drinkable
but
underwhelming
with
no
outstanding
characteristics
i
wont
be
trying
it
again
3
5
pours
a
slightlyhazy
goldenyellow
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
ringy
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
light
floral
character
and
peppers
plus
a
bit
of
brad
hops
are
in
the
front
though
theres
definitely
some
yeast
and
malt
the
flavor
brings
a
nice
light
white
pepper
character
plus
some
faint
earth
and
some
floral
hops
a
bit
bready
as
well
medium
body
with
a
good
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
average
carbonation
a
really
solid
brew
d
delightfully
delicious
and
deceptively
dangerous
very
hoppy
and
quite
bitter
but
not
harsh
just
not
in
the
usual
citrus
and
pine
west
coast
style
raggin
bitch
this
aint
far
more
refined
and
drinkable
more
balanced
but
still
with
some
definite
kick
a
sort
of
very
hoppy
and
strong
pale
with
some
tripel
kick
and
even
some
saisonesque
character
sokay
nothing
special
to
write
home
about
this
ipa
pours
out
as
a
cloudy
yellowish
gold
color
the
smell
has
a
little
bit
of
farmhouse
funk
and
some
earthy
hop
aromas
on
the
nose
the
taste
has
a
hoppy
start
with
a
light
medicinal
flavor
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
with
some
very
minimal
carbonation
the
overall
that
i
get
from
this
beer
is
that
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
it
it
was
average
to
me
i
dont
think
id
have
to
try
it
again
medium
body
with
healthy
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
like
how
it
stays
so
fresh
and
so
clean
dry
at
all
times
not
bitter
diverse
flavor
and
enjoyable
all
the
way
through
poured
a
cloudy
unfiltered
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
retained
well
throughout
strong
yeasty
aroma
with
citrus
and
herbs
apparent
similar
taste
with
heavy
bready
yeasts
and
various
bursts
of
citrus
herbs
cloves
hop
bitterness
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
very
complex
and
nice
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
very
educational
drink
to
the
palate
quite
nice
to
look
at
great
aroma
a
really
fullflavored
unfiltered
begian
delight
overall
a
great
feeling
8
abv
whose
strong
character
and
complexity
would
be
perfect
for
food
pairing
a
thing
i
like
about
belgian
beer
is
that
in
belgium
hoppy
doesnt
mean
the
same
thing
that
it
often
does
in
america
it
means
a
beer
that
may
be
sharp
but
its
also
soft
especially
when
balanced
nicely
with
a
good
wad
of
malt
it
doesnt
mean
youll
be
assaulted
by
a
crate
of
sophomoric
brewers
with
a
fixation
on
arid
bottles
of
grapefruitjuicy
beer
carolus
is
a
good
example
of
belgium
in
a
bottle
not
too
squishy
not
very
sharp
but
pointy
enough
to
give
a
decent
refreshing
sting
a
good
nicely
priced
bottle
of
beer
on
the
palette
it
is
soft
and
powdery
with
subtle
fruit
followed
by
a
nice
bracing
bitter
backbone
and
a
clean
lingering
finish
of
soft
yeast
bitter
hops
and
a
pleasant
subtle
tartness
d
very
nice
and
light
and
something
that
i
would
be
more
than
willing
to
have
just
one
of
across
the
board
this
brew
stands
out
smell
of
pear
and
peach
with
a
dash
of
pepper
and
clove
taste
of
pitted
fruit
unripe
peach
sharp
with
layers
of
malty
sweetness
mingled
with
more
sour
fruity
notes
hoppy
presence
with
cleansing
mouthfeel
alternate
sweet
and
sour
with
hops
added
makles
for
an
interesting
glass
of
contrasts
decent
belgian
always
welcome
in
my
home
murky
goldenorange
in
colour
the
gentlest
of
pours
results
in
an
inches
worth
of
dense
white
foam
on
top
great
retention
and
lots
of
fine
lace
lots
of
little
white
floaties
settled
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
love
the
look
an
intense
floral
aroma
gives
way
to
baking
bread
and
pepper
strong
lemon
leaf
hop
flavour
and
bitterness
malt
gives
it
some
mild
sweetness
balance
while
the
yeast
brings
a
nice
peppery
flavour
a
little
bit
of
peachy
fruit
and
a
hint
of
clove
to
the
table
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
very
fine
bubbles
feels
light
but
velvety
and
smooth
lovely
overall
all
in
all
a
very
good
brew
really
hides
the
higher
abv
very
well
very
sexy
looking
beer
that
translates
into
a
very
good
drinking
beer
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
ive
definitely
never
tried
anything
like
this
before
its
pretty
good
stuff
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
getting
it
again
belgian
pilsner
isnt
something
i
ever
find
myself
craving
not
exactly
my
thing
but
definitely
worth
checking
out
a
nice
offering
but
not
the
best
gouden
carolus
by
any
means
oim
going
back
to
get
more
of
this
stuff
i
really
liked
it
its
important
to
understand
hopsinjoor
as
a
homage
to
american
ipas
not
as
a
carboncopy
i
appreciate
the
beer
a
whole
lot
more
having
come
to
peace
with
that
lets
just
call
a
spade
a
spade
this
isnt
something
to
reach
for
in
the
heat
of
a
hop
withdrawal
its
something
better
slowly
savored
with
a
fine
meal
but
under
the
guise
of
a
strong
belgian
pale
ale
this
is
every
bit
the
quality
offering
you
can
expect
from
het
anker
o
an
improved
mouthfeel
would
certainly
increase
the
overall
score
and
id
venture
to
say
that
my
opinion
would
be
different
if
this
were
the
bottled
beer
an
excellent
belgian
ipa
nonetheless
and
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
a
bottle
for
comparison
really
pleasant
drinker
well
made
and
the
hopping
in
this
is
very
well
integrated
while
still
being
dominant
a
rarity
in
the
style
having
to
deal
with
the
carbonation
explosion
and
the
long
pour
made
me
grade
this
beer
a
little
lower
than
i
would
like
to
have
a
definite
buy
when
on
sale
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
id
never
refuse
but
i
wish
it
stood
out
more
overall
this
beer
was
very
well
balanced
and
probably
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
ever
had
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
drinkability
was
through
the
roof
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
a
must
try
ill
be
sure
to
stock
up
on
it
d
very
drinkable
maybe
a
bit
too
much
pretty
fine
brew
alcohol
crept
up
on
me
though
will
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
for
the
cellar
poured
from
a
750ml
into
a
golden
draak
tulip
glass
large
foamy
head
not
tight
bubbles
but
rother
large
ones
the
color
is
slightly
hazy
and
bright
golden
the
carbonation
is
steady
and
medium
teh
aroma
is
of
grassy
earthy
hops
the
european
varities
are
what
you
smell
and
taste
the
flavor
to
me
is
a
little
too
much
on
the
grassy
side
the
hops
dominate
the
flavor
throughout
a
little
bit
of
bandaide
taste
comes
to
mind
the
spicy
hops
have
no
malt
to
give
a
counter
balance
unlike
an
american
ipa
this
belgian
version
does
not
coat
your
mouth
with
hop
oils
better
in
theory
imo
drinkability
is
just
above
average
it
goes
down
quickly
but
you
might
not
be
reach
for
another
immediately
the
flavor
starts
with
a
surprising
malt
base
that
i
didnt
detect
in
the
smell
the
yeast
is
subdued
until
the
swallow
but
the
hop
is
intensevery
bitter
with
lots
of
grapefruit
mild
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
superb
complexity
lots
of
variation
in
the
flavors
the
body
is
typical
for
the
style
while
the
carbonation
is
mildly
prickly
hops
are
strong
enough
either
the
nose
or
mouth
spicy
fragrances
like
pepper
green
and
resinous
hops
enough
but
really
does
not
increase
the
freshness
of
the
beverage
as
in
eg
xx
bitter
the
bitterness
is
sharp
but
not
optimal
because
the
coarse
side
and
grassy
hops
takes
over
the
top
and
the
other
flavors
including
citrus
little
that
can
be
detected
the
only
real
flaw
for
me
is
how
much
head
results
from
the
pour
otherwise
theres
nothing
to
complain
about
here
to
be
honest
i
wasnt
expecting
much
here
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
hops
didnt
overpower
the
beer
yet
added
a
substantial
bitter
and
spicy
punch
that
nicely
complemented
the
spiciness
from
the
yeast
right
on
drinkability
is
quite
high
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overly
so
and
the
taste
is
quite
refreshing
definitely
a
nice
beer
glad
the
lcbo
brought
this
one
in
d
from
a
flavour
point
of
view
i
thought
this
was
very
good
however
the
absurd
foaminess
made
it
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
pour
pours
a
golden
yellow
colour
with
huge
pillowy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
grassy
hops
with
spicy
belgian
yeast
flavour
has
a
mild
sweetness
to
it
aftertaste
is
leave
some
peach
and
spices
pretty
big
carbonation
for
the
style
a
fairly
nice
belgian
ipa
but
not
one
of
my
favourites
either
d
this
was
a
good
beer
but
a
little
disappointing
tasted
like
a
typical
strong
belgian
alepale
ale
to
me
and
i
expected
more
from
the
hops
still
good
for
what
it
was
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
mild
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
any
typical
belgian
white
beer
the
taste
is
also
more
traditional
white
than
id
expected
given
the
hopsinjoor
name
and
ipa
classification
there
is
a
bitterness
to
the
finish
which
is
pleasant
but
no
sign
of
hops
to
my
west
coast
hop
tastes
over
the
majority
of
the
palate
a
lot
of
fruit
yeast
flavours
and
would
be
a
pleasant
warm
weather
ale
d
delicious
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
for
sure
refreshing
no
alcohol
noticable
dangerously
drinkable
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
yellow
colour
with
a
ridiculous
amount
of
puffy
white
head
took
me
awhile
just
to
be
able
to
pour
the
entire
beer
very
nice
appearence
though
has
a
slight
banana
taste
to
add
to
the
european
hop
bitterness
quite
drinkable
and
i
kinda
wish
i
was
having
this
later
on
in
the
summer
as
it
would
be
perfect
for
that
weather
very
refreshing

very

i
found
the

wasnt

the
beer
was

the

is
evident
immediately
after
a
second
the
pear

light

come
through

finish
is
quite
dry
with
a
small
kick
of
the
spicy

hopsinjoor
uses
golding

moderately
warming
notes
from
the
alcohol
which
become
more
pronounced
with
warming
high
and
active
carbonation
and
a
reasonable
drink
good
for
an
after
dinner
beer
just
as
i
enjoyed
it
d
the
beer
is
quite
quaffable
considering
the
alcohol
content
which
is
well
masked
and
strong
amount
of
bitterness
the
hop
flavors
are
well
balanced
by
the
underlying
malts
gouden
carolus
hopsinjoor
was
orangeyellow
in
color
and
very
cloudy
it
had
a
large
rocky
white
head
with
very
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
the
smell
was
euro
hops
yeast
and
some
light
malt
the
taste
was
hop
forward
with
floral
and
earthy
notes
as
well
as
malt
yeast
flavors
and
peppery
spices
the
finish
was
long
and
dry
with
some
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
plus
body
and
about
medium
carbonation
a
bit
creamy
the
drinkability
was
outstanding
and
the
alcohol
well
hidden
this
is
a
very
good
beer
highly
recommended
d
quite
drinkable
but
not
everyday
fare
nevertheless
easy
drinkable
and
recommended
for
all
glad
to
have
these
on
the
european
market
this
beer
is
awesome
if
you
dont
like
belgian
beer
because
of
its
sweetness
this
beer
is
for
you
it
carries
itself
with
the
exquisite
craftsmanship
of
a
belgian
brew
with
hints
of
hops
well
suited
for
an
american
palate
a
nice
belgian
ipa
thats
easy
to
drink
but
not
my
favorite
this
is
a
good
brew
plenty
of
flavor
up
front
turns
into
a
quick
bitter
finish
the
balance
is
quite
nice
d
a
good
beer
from
het
anker
but
not
their
best
by
a
long
shot
not
all
that
different
than
other
moderately
hoppy
belgian
pale
ales
yummy
i
always
love
a
gouden
carolus
and
this
one
is
no
exception
try
it
d
can
i
have
another
please
this
style
is
new
to
me
as
well
as
most
beligum
made
american
style
beers
and
since
i
have
just
the
one
bottle
ill
have
to
do
some
further
research
on
this
topic
pleasant
full
well
structured
d
the
hopsinjoor
was
a
real
treat
indeed
a
complex
belgian
ale
but
very
easy
to
drink
more
and
more
flavours
became
more
evident
with
every
sip
a
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
with
patience
at
8
you
should
have
no
problem
sipping
and
savoring
this
tasty
belgian
ipa
pale
blonde
to
the
very
last
sip
highly
reccomended
drinkability
refreshing
and
tasty
this
is
still
a
bigflavored
beer
i
would
love
to
have
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
session
this
bad
boy
d
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
the
percentage
i
could
definitely
have
a
couple
nice
fairly
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
more
readily
available
belgian
ipas
out
there
drinkability
the
more
i
sipped
on
this
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
this
would
be
the
perfect
beer
the
next
time
i
eat
sushi
d
this
was
a
very
tasty
and
complex
beer
with
bitter
and
sour
elements
balanced
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
it
had
a
delicate
scent
and
taste
with
nice
body
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
it
was
still
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
solid
belgian
ipa
though
i
personally
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
hops
especially
tropical
american
ones
rather
than
the
earthy
euro
hops
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
the
whole
throat
coating
is
too
distracting
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
beers
attributes
too
bad
because
i
really
like
everything
else
ive
had
from
this
brewery
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
with
carbonation
and
some
wetness
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
very
fresh
tasting
slightly
warming
and
way
drinkable
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
and
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
except
the
strength
would
make
it
a
short
session
d
a
pleasant
interestingly
complex
belgian
ipa
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
little
hoppier
its
definitely
more
measured
than
i
might
have
been
expecting
that
said
its
got
a
deep
subtle
yeasty
character
that
works
pretty
nicely
its
a
good
beer
just
a
little
underpowered
a
hint
of
warming
alcohol
medium

with
a
good
amount
of

hoppy
citrusy
some

and
orange
notes
as
a
little
abv
bite
with
some
sweet
sugary
caramel
malt
not
the
greatest
belgian
ale
but
it
is
balanced
and
a
good
drink
to
have
and
has
a
little
bit
of
everything
so
this
beer
is
named
for
a
hoppy
puppet
whatever
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
clove
pepper
rye
bread
banana
light
mandarin
oranges
grapefruit
and
a
healthy
load
o
hoppy
florals
the
taste
holds
notes
of
ruby
red
grapefruit
sharp
pine
hardcore
flowers
cloves
and
yeasty
goodness
are
they
sure
there
are
hops
in
this
the
body
is
a
heavy
light
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
crisp
semidry
finish
overall
a
nice
hoppy
belgian
though
its
questionable
whether
or
not
i
can
rock
very
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
this
belgian
intensely
hopped
beer
was
average
at
best
pleasant
but
nothing
special
but
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
worth
orderingtasting
if
youve
never
sampled
before
with
so
many
poor
examples
of
this
style
out
there
this
is
a
good
all
around
drink
t
dry
taste
lots
of
malt
and
herbs
which
highlights
final
widespread
bitterness
and
flavored
alcohol
perception
is
significant
drinkability
isnt
to
high
just
a
bitter
phenolic
belgian
blonde
while
i
dont
think
think
most
native
bipas
travel
well
here
this
one
strikes
me
as
a
particularly
bad
example
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
in
the
aroma
coriander
yeasty
and
dry
in
the
taste
coriander
a
bit
hoppy
and
a
dry
yeastiness
a
small
bitterness
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
hop
and
pinch
of
coriander
in
the
aftertaste
nice
flavor
and
mellow
hops
quite
easy
to
drink
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
pale
yellow
and
has
a
super
light
and
fluffy
bright
white
head
the
head
has
great
staying
power
and
leaves
delicate
lace
as
i
savor
this
beer
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
plenty
of
banana
and
green
apple
as
well
as
spicy
herbal
hops
and
a
slight
tartness
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
quite
surprising
for
one
thing
the
8
abv
really
shows
through
but
it
works
for
this
beer
and
is
actually
a
good
thing
this
beer
is
quite
hoppy
with
plenty
of
herbal
grassy
lemony
and
spicy
hops
dominating
the
flavor
there
is
a
definite
sweet
malt
presence
as
well
but
it
seems
like
the
hops
and
the
belgian
yeast
are
the
stars
i
also
get
a
bit
of
banana
and
green
apple
maybe
a
bit
of
bubble
gum
this
beer
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
an
english
ipa
a
saison
and
a
wit
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
slightly
tart
finish
this
beer
would
be
more
drinkable
if
it
had
a
lower
abv
but
it
still
goes
down
pretty
easily
a
great
find
for
a
random
buy
beer
drinkability
none
of
the
flavors
are
too
overwhelming
and
thus
the
beer
despite
its
abv
could
almost
be
considered
sessionable
like
a
good
ipa
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
up
front
followed
by
crisp
light
fruit
notes
alcohol
warmth
and
pilsner
malt
all
balanced
by
a
decent
earthy
hop
profile
nicely
balanced
with
hints
of
apple
and
pear
a
slightly
creamy
body
and
a
bitter
dry
finish
d
pretty
tasty
could
have
a
few
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
great
carbonation
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
the
beer
was
extremely
refreshing
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
overall
perhaps
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
this
is
so
refreshing
after
all
the
over
the
top
domestic
ipas
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
golden
color
with
an
extremely
white
foamy
head
on
the
nose
you
definitely
pick
up
the
hops
with
aromas
of
grapefruit
banana
orange
and
corriander
the
palate
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
sense
of
hops
in
which
the
bitterness
is
toned
down
some
sweetness
with
flavors
of
grapefruit
orange
honey
and
toffee
overall
a
total
surprise
and
not
a
bad
one
at
all
hopsinjoor
is
more
hoppy
than
i
ever
thought
a
belgian
beer
could
be
drinkability
fairly
enjoyable
a
quality
nicely
complex
belgian
brew
with
a
dialed
up
hop
character
and
bitterness
great
beer
makes
me
wonder
why
ive
gotten
away
from
the
belgian
styles
that
i
used
to
drink
almost
exclusively
very
drinkable
beer
really
is
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
style
ipa
one
that
combines
a
belgian
blond
ale
style
and
the
fruity
triple
style
with
belgian
yeasts
and
a
strong
dose
of
hops
a
good
beer
ill
have
again
but
there
are
many
more
id
have
first
mouthfeel
is
full
with
the
carbonation
giving
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
feel

style
iam
just
now
starting
to
go
tothere
are
some
things
i
likeand
dont

creamy

onsetsome
phenols

well
well
its
not
the
american

bitchbut
i
respect
the
beerjust
not
enough
of
the
hop
oomph
i
look
for
oh
my
gosh
is
this
good
beer
lawd
gawdamighty
didnt
take
much
to
pour
a
huge
finely
frothed
off

hoppy

very
yeasty
and
a
hint
of

flavors
about
the
same
great

aroma
is
of
some
lemony

a

funk
and
some
wispy
tartness
taste
to
me
personally
is
a
bit
more
towards
the
saison
side
of
the
spectrum
than
an
ipa
im
sure
the
yeast
has
everything
to
do
with
that
no
matter
the
beer
is
delicious
and
refreshing
overall
very
good
hop
loves
will
like
this
beer
however
the
hops
are
not
aromatic
so
it
is
not
like
a
dipa
in
anyway
but
it
is
a
good
example
of
a
classic
belgian
style
with
the
hops
turned
up
a
bit
a
great
food
beer
to
go
with
some
robust
end
of
winter
meals
i
was
expecting
a
little
hoppiness
and
instead
i
got
a
belgian
pale
ale
not
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
you
wont
be
getting
that
little
extra
sumpthin
in
the
way
of
those
little
green
flowers
notes
european
hops
used
are
apparent
as
it
doesnt
have
the
same
fruitiness
from
hops
as
american
ipas
and
dipas
so
if
you
are
expecting
something
similar
to
one
of
these
you
may
be
disappointed
i
enjoyed
it
though
as
it
was
was
like
a
bspa
with
the
added
complexity
of
the
multiple
hops
drinkability
well
if
you
like
those
previously
mentioned
attributes
then
this
beer
could
be
amazingly
drinkable
i
dont
believe
in
drain
pours
and
this
beer
is
very
lucky
i
dont
drinkability
its
quite
nice
especially
if
you
swirl
the
beer
around
after
youve
poured
it
and
let
some
of
the
carbonation
escape
dont
do
it
in
the
bottle
since
this
beer
is
bottleconditions
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
almost
a
tripel
feel
to
this
beer
with
a
spicy
biting
alcoholic
note
to
it
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
fine
bitterness
grows
as
you
drink
im
not
sure
id
classify
it
as
an
ipa
but
its
a
good
beer
d
oh
yeah
id
have
this
beer
again
i
couldnt
even
really
tell
that
it
was
8
abv
which
is
why
id
have
to
be
careful
about
controlling
my
intake
reviewed
from
my
notes
served
in
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
has
an
interesting
yellow
color
it
is
cloudy
and
translucent
there
is
a
thick
head
of
white
foam
it
leaves
impressive
lacing
there
is
carbonation
rising
in
the
glass
as
well
as
a
number
of
small
bubbles
attached
to
the
side
of
the
glass
it
has
a
warm
hoppy
aroma
and
some
earthy
yeast
the
beer
tastes
a
bit
sweet
at
first
there
is
a
gentle
hop
bitterness
and
a
slight
peppery
bite
in
the
finish
the
menu
description
claims
there
is
a
citrus
flavor
as
well
and
i
think
i
can
taste
it
but
it
may
be
entirely
through
the
power
of
suggestion
as
i
type
this
up
the
day
after
taking
the
notes
i
can
still
clearly
recall
the
pepper
aspects
that
doesnt
usually
happen
to
me
it
has
a
light
body
with
a
bit
of
mouthcoating
theres
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
a
peppery
burn
but
nothing
like
the
feeling
of
a
chili
beer
i
find
this
beer
to
be
fairly
drinkable
to
me
it
should
be
enjoyed
at
a
moderate
pace
not
too
fast
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
sipped
over
an
hour
either
its
a
quality
beer
but
i
dont
think
id
order
more
than
one
in
an
evening
notes
my
third
gouden
carolus
beer
had
the
noel
and
the
tripel
prior
to
this
and
i
have
been
happy
with
every
one
of
them
next
up
is
the
carolus
dor
grand
cru
of
the
emperor
d
i
could
certainly
drink
a
750
of
this
with
ease
but
at
the
price
i
might
reach
for
a
more
affordable
american
version
next
time
o
great
more
subdued
hop
presence
than
belgian
ipas
using
american
oriented
hop
alc
rougher
with
warmth
lots
of
pearcandy
very
nice
belgian
hop
presence
the
body
is
a
hazy
dark
straw
colour
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
very
fruity
there
is
lots
of
citrus
alongside
a
subtle
toffee
and
a
clear
yeastiness
the
taste
is
fresh
and
crisp
with
more
fruity
citrus
but
with
a
slight
dry
edge
there
is
more
belgian
yeast
in
the
taste
with
a
slight
biscuity
taste
towards
the
end
alongside
a
floral
bitterness
the
flavours
are
very
dry
and
crisp
which
makes
this
a
brilliant
summer
beer
the
belgian
ipa
style
is
growing
on
me
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
very
thick
white
head
aroma
is
crisp
strong
and
malty
with
a
fruity
hint
more
like
a
highgrade
lager
flavor
is
hoppy
and
sharp
only
a
little
bitter
with
a
fruity
undertone
and
a
bit
of
a
tinny
taste
texture
is
fizzy
and
smooth
leaving
a
hoppy
and
fruity
finish
d
like
all
beers
with
charles
v
on
a
horse
excellent
i
liked
the
way
that
hides
the
abv
in
the
smell
taste
and
feel
this
has
toppled
mcchouffehoublon
chouffe
as
my
fave
belgian
blonde
this
is
the
capstone
of
the
pyramid
imho
a
little
bitter
for
my
taste
but
still
a
very
good
beer
it
is
not
as
complex
as
many
of
the
belgians
i
have
tried
but
it
is
very
fine
beer
it
is
drinkable
and
could
be
paired
with
cheese
and
fish
or
chicken
dishes
or
enjoyed
alone
or
with
friends
or
with
a
nice
salad
or
maybe
tuna
or
linguine
or
tuna
and
linguine
or
some
type
of
quiche
maybe
a
tuna
and
linguine
quiche
no
not
that
stick
with
the
chicken
some
kind
of
white
sauce
and
parmesan
or
the
like
taste
is
lightly
winey
throughout
with
light
sweet
fruitiness
some
bread
throughout
it
has
definite
hoppiness
that
builds
to
a
hoppy
lightly
bitter
finish
with
leaves
hay
grassypeppery
spiciness
all
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
a
bit
too

taste
is
orangey
and
slightly
sweet
not
cloying
or
oppressively
phenolic
like
some
belgians
though
maybe
its
because
the
hop

balances
it

this

ddefinitely
enjoyable
and
drinkable
watch
the

though
not
extreme
d
this
is
a
really
really
good
beer
undeniable
belgian
insanely
drinkable
the
8
abv
is
well
hidden
i
would
gladly
welcome
the
chance
to
revisit
in
the
future
one
of
the
most
intense
complex
tastings
that
doesnt
loose
its
deft
balance
of
flavors
truly
impressive
i
appear
to
be
in
a
minority
on
this
one
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
huge
head
that
displayed
pretty
good
retention
the
aroma
was
kind
of
a
euro
lager
skunky
i
couldnt
taste
much
of
the
hops
bitter
the
carbonation
tended
to
disguise
everything
im
not
a
fan
of
the
belgian
ipa
idea
just
way
too
much
carbonation
as
it
warmed
i
did
get
some
bitter
aftertaste
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
tons
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
ok
not
terrible
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
stein
of
beer
or
goblet
of
beer
whatever
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
nice
all
around
good
drink
overall
an
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
pretty
unusual
for
a
belgian
tasty
but
at
the
same
time
not
something
im
going
to
be
going
back
to
all
that
often
it
is
a
tough
beer
for
drinkability
as
you
need
time
to
contemplate
it
at
the
abv
certainly
means
that
it
isnt
a
chugger
soft
and
creamy
with
mildmoderate

very
good
drinkability
a
fragrant
and
exciting
drop
bursting
with
character
it
lacks
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
body
on
the
palate
but
otherwise
very
fine
indeed
d
overall
hopsinjoor
was
an
enjoyable
beer
and
certainly
an
interesting
experience
however
750ml
is
a
bit
much
in
a
sitting
and
i
found
myself
growing
weary
of
the
big
medicinal
notes
coupled
with
moderate
bitterness
after
a
couple
of
glasses
given
my
limited
experience
with
belgian
ipas
this
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
so
far
drinkability
soooo
smooth
i
wish
i
can
find
this
where
i
live
i
can
become
a
drunkaholic
it
is
every
persons
dream
right
a
strong
elegant
belgian
pale
ale
twisted
with
an
ipa
gotta
love
the
belgian
ipa
i
really
love
this
beer
a
classic
slightly
tart
and
finishes
super
clean
and
dry
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
another
really
nice
belgian
ipa
a
very
drinkable
belgian
ipa
that
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
try
from
draught
will
definitely
pick
up
a
few
bottles
of
this
to
my
next
trip
to
belgium
drinkability
330
ml
definitely
wasnt
enough
should
have
gone
for
the
750
no
alcohol
burn
at
all
a
solid
base
beer
and
a
really
thorough
clean
bright
hop
addition
make
for
a
really
enjoyable
drink
i
wouldnt
quite
put
this
on
top
of
the
chouffe
bipa
and
i
do
admittedly
have
a
bit
of
a
bias
for
this
style
its
in
my
top
3
but
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
appropriate
for
the
season
stylistically
true
and
damn
tasty
to
boot
recommended
one
hell
of
a
beer
i
would
personally
have
liked
it
more
if
it
had
been
a
tad
less
hoppy
but
i
wouldnt
hold
my
personal
tastes
against
the
quality
of
the
beer
this
is
a
winner
all
around
this
isnt
just
about
dumping
hops
in
the
hop
complexities
are
wonderful
with
just
the
right
touch
of
malt
to
round
it
out
a
wonderful
strong
belgian
ipa
another
winner
from
this
great
brewery
good
beer
tough
to
drink
more
than
one
though
md
not
getting
the
same
bitterness
as
some
have
said
so
i
guess
the
hops
have
faded
but
there
is
just
a
touch
of
ummph
to
this
on
the
tounge
to
suffice
hopsinjoor
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carb
as
witnessed
by
the
huge
amount
of
rising
bubbles
drinkability
well
lets
just
say
that
i
should
of
bought
a
bigger
bottle
drinkability
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
big
sweet
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
great
beer
and
the
main
fallback
is
that
this
wasnt
offered
as
a
magnum
or
jeraboam
as
i
wanted
to
be
sipping
it
all
afternoon
long
it
is
interesting
to
see
more
belgian
breweries
experimenting
with
hoppier
drier
more
bitter
beers
personally
i
think
it
can
only
be
a
good
thing
as
on
my
recent
jan
09
visit
to
belgium
i
found
that
far
too
many
beers
were
under
hopped
and
oversweet
while
this
belgian
ipa
isnt
quite
up
to
the
standard
of
the
trappist
ales
it
is
still
a
very
good
beer
and
should
appeal
to
the
american
hop
heads
this
beer
looks
great
the
color
is
a
glowing
straw
yellow
with
an
enormous
head
that
leaves
craggy
clumps
of
foam
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
other
hand
pretty
much
all
of
the
top
belgian
ipas
look
great
so
its
hard
to
give
full
marks
the
aroma
is
of
juicy
tangerines
and
interesting
dry
and
earthy
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
like
a
light
and
hoppy
tripel
theres
a
great
sweet
malt
backbone
some
phenolic
character
sour
apples
hops
like
a
bite
of
a
very
ripe
apricot
and
a
refined
complex
belgian
yeast
the
feel
is
creamy
and
light
for
the
alcohol
content
its
quite
drinkable
the
malt
sweetness
is
balanced
by
an
excellent
hop
bite
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
and
one
i
was
glad
to
try
drinks
very
easily
with
a
nice
hoppy
dry
finish
d
extremely
sippable
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
then
again

of
the

that
ive
tried
so
far
gouden
carolus
and
cuvee
van
de
keizer
red
and

have
never
struck
a

drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
belgian
ipa
right
on
par
with
what
you
would
expect
md
soft
on
the
palate
which
is
marvellously
carbonated
as
witness
to
successful
bottleconditioning
while
the
light
body
helps
elevate
the
weight
of
8abv
effortlessly
compared
with
my
recent
encounters
with
three
other
belgian
ipas
and
very
interesting
subtle
peppery
spice
and
little
alcohol
presence
i
havent
tried
the
duvel
tripel
hop
yet
but
i
imagine
it
to
be
something
like

this
is
a
magnificent
blonde
ale
would
love
to
taste
on
tap
sometime
quentincompsonjul
21
piney
if
i
wanted
to
drink
something
that
tasted
like
a
cheap
bottle
of
chardonnay
than
i
would
buy
a
cheap
bottle
of
chardonnay
id
avoid
it
i
hate
that
beer
has
become
so
pretentious
and
now
we
have
people
rating
this
sour
white
grape
flavored
beer
with
an
overall
score
of
91
and
94
are
you
kidding
me
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
impressive
uses
of
wine
barreling
weve
ever
encountered
the
chardonnay
flavoring
just
pours
off
of
the
oak
blending
with
the
warming
bold
graininess
of
a
surprisingly
bitter
base
tripel
the
result
is
rather
mixed
however
you
find
cloying
sugars
clashing
with
the
most
intensely
puckering
and
bittering
phenols
around
all
with
this
grapey
wine
and
ethanol
flavoring
that
never
fully
clicks
for
us
the
biggest
surprise
here
is
that
nose
it
tends
towards
the
wild
side
more
so
than
either
a
belgian
ipa
or
a
tripel
its
hard
to
nail
this
down
stylistically
as
so
many
things
are
mentioned
on
the
bottle
contrasting
with
what
we
actually
get
that
is
probably
why
we
felt
so
discombobulated
through
the
flavoring
and
beyond
you
never
quite
know
where
you
are
with
this
beer
and
it
leaves
you
questioning
your
own
basic
knowledge
of
beer
as
our
introduction
to
nebraska
brewing
company
this
has
certainly
piqued
our
interest
o
need
to
do
this
next
summer
out
by
the
pool
i
feel
like
im
in
napa
valley
at
a
wine
tasting
quite
enjoyable
so
i
was
at
the
nebraska
brewing
co
last
night
and
was
told
that
they
couldnt
sell
me
this
delicious
beer
apparently
they
received
a
cease
an
desist
letter
from
a
brewery
in
tennessee
with
the
naming
rights
to
hop
god
smh
there
will
be
no
more
hop
god
in
nebraska
ever
so
i
called
half
of
the
liquor
stores
in
the
city
before
i
finally
found
one
that
had
a
bottle
four
bottles
to
be
exact
bought
em
all
best
80
i
have
ever
spent
if
you
can
find
this
beer
buy
it
interesting
brew
served
in
a
6
oz
glass
at
the
white
oak
tavern
in
ellicott
city
md
weak
nose
but
citrus
and
grape
must
scents
smooth
mouth
feel
with
minimal
carbonation
and
limited
bitterness
of
hops
chardonnay
flavor
is
noticeable
with
slight
lingering
aftertaste
oenjoyed
the
barrel
characteristics
and
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
in
spite
of
the
abv
hi
i
bought
hop
god
last
night
you
asked
me
to
let
you
know
what
i
thought
first
my
nose
is
almost
completely
dead
from
childhood
allergies
so
i
require
a
beer
that
really
stands
up
to
notice
anything
this
one
does
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
gold
with
a
moderate
head
i
poured
it
pretty
cold
nice
lacing
etc
first
thing
was
i
got
citrus
on
the
nose
its
got
to
be
strong
for
me
to
smell
at
all
a
little
bit
grapefruity
on
the
tongue
its
hard
to
quantify
the
mouth
feel
its
pretty
bright
and
then
hangs
around
with
what
i
think
is
a
citrusy
aftertaste
there
is
actually
enough
going
on
with
this
beer
the
hops
arent
really
the
biggest
thing
at
least
for
me
but
for
a
hop
freak
such
as
myself
they
are
still
there
i
dont
think
it
said
so
on
the
label
but
at
10
its
certainly
its
a
double
also
its
clearly
belgian
yeast
with
some
sour
coming
through
anyway
i
think
the
alcohol
fits
nicely
but
im
accustomed
to
drinking
nines
and
tens
anyway
all
in
all
i
do
like
this
beer
its
interesting
sometimes
thats
a
curse
i
guess
but
not
here
i
think
if
i
had
a
complaint
at
all
it
is
that
its
a
little
bit
heavy
on
the
citrus
disclaimer
i
dislike
citrus
is
in
general
i
would
buy
it
again
though
o
the
wine
barrel
aging
lends
nice
flavors
of
chardonnay
but
this
overpowers
the
taste
of
the
underlying
belgian
ipa
a
pretty
tasty
brew
here
theres
a
lot
going
on
between
citrus
adn
malt
and
belgian
yeast
and
saisonlike
sensations
its
a
lot
to
enjoy
od
good
intense
and
worth
the
time
to
sip
it
not
as
much
ipa
character
as
expected
but
it
was
nice
hazy
goldenamber
pour
with
a
wispy
white
head
and
mediumsized
collar
some
tracks
of
lacing
on
the
glass
in
the
nose
belgian
yeast
and
obvious
chardonnay
aromas
herbal
hoppiness
and
pale
malt
sweetness
pretty
much
delivered
what
was
promised
in
the
taste
department
belgian
yeast
complimenting
pale
malts
vinous
flavors
stone
fruits
notes
of
oak
and
light
hop
bitterness
into
the
aftertaste
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
pretty
easily
drinkable
with
the
higher
abv
wellconcealed
nice
overall
o
clearly
this
isnt
much
of
an
ipa
belgianstyle
or
otherwise
the
hops
are
only
a
slight
addition
here
playing
second
fiddle
to
the
barrel
character
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
an
overbarreled
beer
the
base
beer
pretty
much
cowers
in
fear
of
the
chardonnay
barrels
its
a
reasonable
beer
but
considering
how
much
this
brewery
charges
im
having
a
lot
of
trouble
recommending
this
one
except
to
barrel
lovers
that
is
this
beer
is
worth
trying
even
more
so
if
the
price
is
right
balanced
peppery
funky
lots
of
great
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
nice
use
of
funky
yeast
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
my
second
from
nebraska
brewing
and
as
impressive
if
not
more
impressive
than
the
apricot
saison
the
pour
in
this
is
hazy
and
more
yellow
than
golden
it
has
an
inch
or
so
of
pure
white
wispy
head
that
settles
a
bit
but
is
easily
reproduced
with
a
twirl
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
more
wild
yeast
than
belgian
yeast
specifically
taking
on
some
late
summer
farmy
elements
the
hops
arent
as
in
my
face
as
i
expected
them
to
be
in
a
beer
named
hop
god
they
are
tropical
fruity
and
citric
but
not
hardly
bitter
at
all
which
allows
the
complexity
of
the
yeast
to
fully
develop
on
the
palate
some
fresh
cut
grass
in
here
and
some
drying
straw
its
definitely
a
summer
drink
very
active
carbonation
and
only
a
light
malt
body
give
this
beer
a
lot
of
life
and
the
fact
that
it
is
over
10
abv
is
almost
impossible
to
detect
this
was
a
real
treat
many
thanks
to
claystation
for
sharing
it
with
me
i
have
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
their
stuff
both
ive
tried
have
been
absolutely
fantastic
this
is
proof
that
the
midwest
isnt
all
bad
overall
if
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
more
closely
resembled
the
aroma
this
would
have
been
an
amazing
beverage
however
on
the
tongue
the
hops
simply
overwhelm
everything
and
combine
with
the
high
abv
to
produce
a
hopandvodka
martini
overtone
that
so
heavily
dominates
the
beer
as
to
make
most
of
the
other
flavors
quite
difficult
to
detect
the
beer
is
definitely
out
of
balance
because
of
this
to
such
an
extent
that
even
hopheads
might
have
a
problem
starts
with
a
rich
barley
flavor
holding
the
liquid
in
my
mouth
a
subtle
carbonation
shows
up
preventing
the
beer
from
getting
coy
just
prior
to
the
swallow
the
alcohol
is
notable
oily
and
warming
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
is
all
hop
and
alcohol
the
hop
portion
is
bittering
without
any
strong
spiciness
in
a
word
complex
this
is
a
very
interesting
blend
of
belgian
ipa
with
some
winebarrel
influence
adding
to
the
complexity
in
general
very
phenolic
and
bitter
with
some
mild
tropical
and
vinous
elemments
overall
i
was
more
than
pleased
with
the
flavor
and
intensity
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
hoppy
belgians
not
over
the
top
with
bitterness
to
the
extent
that
you
cant
get
the
wine
barrel
in
the
flavor
profile
highly
enjoyable
although
primarily
a
brewpub
they
do
things
right
if
you
are
passing
through
try
it
if
you
can
get
it
buy
it
tyson
arp
and
co
are
doing
really
great
things
with
beer
a
good
dipa
with
chardonnay
notes
is
what
it
is
maybe
it
took
me
off
guard
seemed
to
get
better
as
i
went
i
actually
winced
a
little
though
not
something
i
do
often
with
beer
i
drank
the
25
oz
bottle
over
two
days
and
enjoyed
it
more
on
the
second
perhaps
it
needed
to
breathe
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
ipa
was
a
golden
color
with
an
modest
white
head
retention
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
evident
a
winelike
aroma
with
a
certain
measure
of
hops
dominated
the
aroma
in
the
interest
of
honesty
it
smell
more
like
wine
than
beer
the
initial
taste
had
a
sour
grapelike
potency
it
was
not
overly
sour
as
to
dominate
the
taste
but
it
was
certainly
at
the
front
notes
of
grapefruit
peach
and
the
hops
were
also
evident
the
peach
comes
out
a
little
more
in
the
aftertaste
with
modest
grapefruit
yields
to
a
warming
sensation
on
the
back
of
the
throat
the
mouthfeel
was
not
as
thick
as
i
would
have
liked
but
it
worked
overall
i
am
not
sure
hop
god
was
worth
the
price
tag
however
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
is
somebody
else
picked
up
the
bill
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
of
malt
grain
citrus
fruit
floral
aromas
and
some
spices
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
herbal
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
better
smell
than
taste
in
my
opinion
o
overall
decent
nothing
crazy
overall
i
have
had
mixed
results
with
the
previous
nebraska
beers
i
have
tasted
but
this
one
really
delivers
the
goods
definitely
worth
the
high
price
of
admission
superior
drinakability
for
the
style
abv
i
love
the
american
slanted
hop
attack
of
this
beer
first
bber
from
this
brewery
i
am
blown
away
d
complex
definately
a
sipper
avoid
if
you
do
not
like
chardonnay
share
the
750
with
friends
oi
am
really
impressed
i
typically
find
the
belgian
ipa
style
too
abrasive
and
contrasting
with
musty
yeast
and
citrus
hops
not
sure
if
it
is
the
oaking
on
chardonnay
barrels
or
the
fermentation
staying
at
a
lower
temp
limiting
the
ester
blow
off
but
this
is
so
polished
well
integrated
and
an
absolute
pleasure
i
will
buy
a
few
cases
no
matter
the
cost
next
time
i
am
in
nebraska
excellent
work
nebraska
brewing
company
its
quite
likeable
though
a
bit
odd
and
im
not
sure
what
stylecategory
it
should
really
be
in
however
if
you
like
sours
or
you
like
chardonnay
as
i
like
both
a
lot
definitely
try
this
one
for
a
special
occasion
sometime
with
sophisticated
beer
drinkers
only
if
youre
expecting
some
kind
of
bold
ipa
you
will
probably
be
disappointed
an
interesting
and
quite
tasty
belgian
ipa
from
nebraska
brewing
company
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
the
chardonnay
characters
took
over
to
much
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
the
flavors
were
not
something
i
found
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
above
average
carbonation
and
there
is
a
sweet
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
not
perfectly
hidden
but
is
hidden
pretty
well
for
10
00
abv
beer
a
bit
expensive
to
buy
but
still
very
good
96100
overall
its
different
yet
nice
not
something
id
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
by
any
means
especially
for
the
price
but
i
think
its
a
well
thought
out
and
executed
beer
o
very
good
belgian
ipa
has
a
bit
more
of
the
ipa
character
than
the
belgian
side
but
its
still
an
ok
beer
a
pours
a
very
nice
deep
gold
color
with
a
nice
1
inch
head
that
is
white
and
quite
dense
the
head
recedes
quickly
down
to
a
thin
film
and
ring
around
the
glass
with
a
nice
sticky
lacing
to
it
3
5
medium
bodied
but
on
the
fuller
end
with
a
blast
of
dry
earthy
hops
up
front
that
linger
over
the
earthy
oak
and
sweet
fruit
notes
into
a
slightly
dry
lingering
finish
hints
of
pine
needle
as
well
as
some
prominent
lemon
citrus
and
apple
flavor
the
barrel
presence
is
pretty
strong
with
notes
of
dry
toasted
oak
and
a
powerful
vinous
white
wine
character
lots
of
vinous
grape
and
white
wine
which
compliments
the
fruit
from
the
hops
and
belgian
yeast
subtle
alcohol
but
easy
to
drink
with
decently
masked
abv
hops
complimented
by
oakbarrel
and
citrus
complimented
by
estery
fruit
notes
pretty
good
4
d
nice
one
to
try
i
enjoyed
it
ridiculously
drinkable
for
a
big
hoppy
barrelled
up
somethingorother
hits
all
the
right
notes
the
use
of
the
wine
is
simply
divine
original
tasty
hoppy
damn
this
is
superb
im
going
to
nurse
the
rest
of
this
one
with
a
smile
on
my
face
a
very
interesting
treatment
to
an
emerging
style
love
the
dry
chardonay
finish
nebraska
is
definitely
growing
on
me
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
but
with
enough
body
to
support
all
the
complexities
this
beer
has
to
offer
this
is
a
big
beer
and
it
is
assertive
at
times
but
very
complex
all
at
once
i
paired
my
second
pour
with
beef
tenderloin
bites
wrapped
in
bacon
and
i
felt
like
royalty
this
is
a
classy
brew
very
complex
and
strong
a
great
as
my
beer
guy
called
it
celebratory
beer
im
curious
what
the
hop
god
regularnonreserve
must
be
like
hats
off
to
nebraska
brewing
for
quite
an
achievement
cheers
overall
this
is
pretty
decent
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
flavors
are
nice
i
can
appreciate
the
complexity
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
one
would
age
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tasted
top
3
hands
down
my
first
nebraska
and
definitely
not
to
be
the
last
worth
every
goddamned
red
cent
possibly
the
best
beer
in
america
750

pure

getting

character
out

big

buttery

then
a
winey
fruitiness
some
round

and

and
a
tannic
bitter
finish
comes
together
pretty
nicely
but
its
not
very
recognizable
as
an
ipa
of
any
sort
shared
this
one
with
the
group
at
the
evening
wood
tasting
graciously
hosted
by
cmrillo
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
and
fruit
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
the
barrels
on
this
one
were
not
very
pronounced
if
i
am
completely
honest
which
was
kind
of
a
disappointment
however
the
flavor
profile
on
this
one
was
quite
nice
with
the
chardonnay
coming
across
as
a
part
of
the
fruit
character
in
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
lightly
hazy
golden
color
the
head
is
pretty
good
on
this
beer
despite
the
barrel
aging
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
pretty
interesting
its
god
a
good
amount
of
hops
on
the
nose
but
it
also
has
a
a
lot
of
spicy
and
barrel
aromas
the
taste
gives
us
the
hops
upfront
with
a
nice
floral
and
citrusy
flavor
the
bitterness
sets
in
and
then
the
barrel
aging
flavor
give
off
a
light
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
bodied
the
decent
carbonation
overall
the
price
of
these
beers
kill
me
i
hate
paying
for
an
entire
bottle
of
these
because
theyre
always
more
than
20
if
the
was
was
lower
i
could
probably
enjoy
this
a
bit
more
all
in
all
though
i
like
what
they
did
with
this
beer
and
it
did
taste
good
lets
get
in
on
some
winebarreled
bipa
baby
it
pours
a
minimally
hazy
amberstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
orange
zest
coriander
banana
honeydew
and
white
grapes
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mandarin
oranges
ruby
red
grapefruit
melon
clove
banana
peel
red
grapes
and
light
oak
a
sharp
bitterness
bites
at
the
back
o
the
tongue
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
bipa
definitely
something
to
experience
overall
not
recommended
at
all
bad
flavor
dumped
o
the
great
blend
of
belgian
yeast
chardonnay
barrels
and
a
tripel
is
a
great
combination
dry
mellow
oak
and
fruity
grapes
and
green
pine
hops
really
work
well
together
final
note
as
the
beer
warms
its
becoming
even
more
mellow
and
drinks
like
a
velvety
citrus
juice
that
is
being
dripped
into
your
mouth
from
a
piece
of
oak
yes
it
is
good
bottle
poured
a
deep
hazy
dirty
blonde
color
ale
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
a
complex
mix
between
a
dry
hoppy
belgian
ale
with
some
sweet
notes
mix
with
some
light
tart
vinous
notes
taste
is
quite
complex
with
notes
of
sweet
belgian
style
malt
with
dry
hoppy
notes
and
light
tart
vinous
notes
a
bit
lacking
balanced
with
more
vinous
notes
would
have
been
better
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
interesting
experience
though
maybe
lacking
a
bit
of
balance
outstanding
craftmanship
wafting
wine
and
hops
looks
great
though
a
light
colour
full
mouthfeel
very
satisfying
with
the
patience
of
6
months
of
barrel
ageing
is
it
a
double
ipa
or
a
great
white
wine
thanks
michael
for
this
and
all
you
have
done
and
our
wishes
for
your
complete
recovery
d
a
suave
and
sophisticated
sipper
as
a
fan
of
belgian
ipas
i
wish
there
were
more
there
also
arent
too
many
chardonnay
barrelaged
offerings
this
is
a
tremendous
marriage
of
the
two
unlike
anything
ive
encountered
in
beerdom
highly
recommended
a
very
unique
offering
o
a
nice
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
a
bit
of
a
sipper
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
but
would
drink
it
again
if
i
had
the
chance
this
was
a
very
interesting
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
once
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
drink
it
regularly
if
it
was
available
to
me
but
for
a
one
time
sipper
i
really
enjoyed
it
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
and
complex
beer
the
dry
finish
helps
with
the
drinkability
but
the
sweetness
might
get
to
be
a
bit
much
after
a
while
pours
a
moderatelyhazed
orangecopper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
falls
the
nose
brings
some
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
plus
a
good
dose
of
oak
and
chadonnay
the
taste
is
quite
the
improvement
with
some
nice
hop
flavor
and
a
bit
of
grape
skin
and
oak
finish
is
quite
bitter
with
some
nice
oak
tannins
filling
things
out
medium
body
overall
quite
drinkable
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
barrelaged
ipas
that
ive
come
across
the
beer
appears
crystal
clear
and
light
orange
in
color
the
head
stands
in
at
approximately
an
inch
thick
and
displays
lasting
retention
as
the
cap
recedes
it
leaves
a
healthy
dose
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
really
wonderful
with
a
lot
of
barrel
scents
coming
through
prominently
the
flavor
is
very
good
but
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
the
aroma
the
taste
is
very
tannic
as
the
wine
barrels
really
shine
through
the
hop
aspect
is
there
but
is
a
bit
overshadowed
by
the
french
oak
chardonnay
barrel
that
being
said
the
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
what
it
is
frankly
i
did
not
expect
to
enjoy
a
barrelaged
ipa
this
much
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
solid
carbonation
level
a
blend
of
hops
and
barrels
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
is
complex
and
interesting
and
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
best
shared
and
or
enjoyed
in
small
quantities
the
beer
is
relatively
thin
and
the
finish
is
really
dry
at
the
finish
there
is
some
moderate
hop
bitterness
but
there
is
also
a
tannic
quality
to
it
its
strong
but
not
detracting
overall
the
wine
comes
through
in
this
one
slightly
its
a
decent
beer
the
malt
backbone
probably
could
have
stood
out
more
as
well
as
the
hop
bitterness
but
since
we
didnt
have
the
base
beer
i
dont
know
if
the
original
was
more
hop
forward
before
the
exposure
to
the
wine
barrel
i
would
say
that
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
surprisingly
drinkable
especially
since
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
bit
boozy
it
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
the
tartness
makes
it
pretty
enjoyable
to
drink
its
not
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
for
27
i
probably
would
not
buy
it
again
but
it
was
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
to
share
and
discuss
with
fellow
bas
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
drank
this
a
few
months
earlier
because
i
think
the
hops
would
have
been
more
present
and
tasted
even
better
however
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
it
is
delicious
pours
a
slightly
hazed
golden
orange
color
with
a
plume
of
bone
white
froth
great
retention
and
sticky
lacing
scent
is
of
belgian
yeasts
citrusy
hops
and
hints
of
peppry
spice
vanilla
dry
chardonay
and
oak
first
sip
brings
a
hard
taste
of
belgian
yeasts
and
alcohol
smooths
into
a
pleasent
citrusy
and
tropical
hop
note
as
the
malt
begins
to
present
itself
the
flavors
of
peppery
spice
dry
chardonay
and
oak
steal
the
finnish
medoim
bodied
active
carbonation
very
dry
an
interesting
beer
that
is
definitely
as
advertised
would
have
like
the
alcohol
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
toned
down
a
bit
as
in
raging
bitch
and
calibelgique
so
the
other
flavors
have
a
little
more
time
to
shine
d
at
10
the
ale
is
big
and
bad
moderation
is
the
key
to
surviving
it
me
ill
split
it
with
ksak
and
hope
for
the
best
the
very
nice
blend
of
belgian
ipa
and
a
barrel
d
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
for
10
i
had
this
beer
when
it
was
first
released
and
it
has
changed
beyond
recognition
6
months
later
a
hoppy
belgian
in
a
chardonnay
barrel
look
at
where
beer
has
gone
this
beers
epic
head
sticks
all
over
the
glass
as
its
weathered
golden
color
shows
a
perfect
clarity
tartness
from
the
barrel
spice
from
the
alcohol
and
slightly
pungent
hops
make
for
a
very
complex
nose
smooth
and
creamy
the
hops
jump
in
with
some
bitterness
and
latetothegame
flavor
that
lingers
the
alcohol
is
spicy
with
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
wood
and
wine
flavors
are
prevalent
from
middle
to
end
this
brews
maltiness
is
thick
and
bready
some
damn
tasty
beer
and
dangerously
drinkable
for
its
size
d
quite
drinkable
for
a
double
digit
abv
beer
would
be
even
better
if
it
were
better
balanced

hints
of

than

of
belgian

grapefruit
citrus
orange
pulp
sweet
grapes
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
at
first
and
then
melds
into
a
pulpy
orange
finish
like
you
just
took
a
bite
out
of
an
orange
and
got
some
pulp
and
rind
with
it
lots
of
woodsy
notes
as
well
which
reminds
me
a
lot
of
fred
from
the
wood
i
cant
say
i
really
got
the
chardonnay
it
just
blended
with
the
citrusy
fruity
notes
quite
tasty
overall
very
impressive
coming
from
a
brewery
i
hadnt
heard
of
before
too
much
going
on
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
or
recommend
it
d
this
was
solid
i
split
the
bottle
with
two
friends
and
we
didnt
have
a
problem
finishing
it
still
i
probably
wouldnt
explicitly
seek
this
out
again

is
beer
that
will
make
the
palate
of
any
selfrespecting
beer
geek
weep
for
joy
it
has
everything
that
i
like
in
big
beer
and
nothing
that
i
dont
time
to
make
a
trip
to

to
see
what
else
these
guys
can
do
thanks
a
million
eric
d
this
was
a
complex
and
delicious
beverage
that
seemed
like
half
beer
and
half
wine
but
all
wonderful
it
had
a
nice
silky
body
and
hid
the
alcohol
decently
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
preferable
to
sip
a
true
testament
to
superior
brewing
skills
reminiscent
of

suns

d
abv
is
noticeable
as
it
warms
flavors
and
scent
are
very
good
but
begins
to
be
monotonous
as
it
goes
on
very
interesting
and
complex
brew
hv
oak

nicely
with
thick
oak

the

spice
and
yeast
character
moderate
carbonation
and

with

quite
a
tasty
complex
treat
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
oak
and
belgian
yeast
with
some
light
wine
notes
the
flavor
is
belgian
yeast
oak
citrus
fruits
such
as
orange
and
pineapple
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
murky
golden
orange
color
with
a
fantastic
tight
white
head
that
left
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
tart
and
wine
like
due
to
the
barrel
aging
fermented
apple
skins
lemon
and
oak
dominate
the
aroma
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
tart
apple
skins
which
melts
into
a
slightly
sweet
pale
malt
nice
subtle
oak
flavors
play
very
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
can
detect
the
belgian
candi
sugar
but
most
of
the
hops
and
yeasty
goodness
is
hidden
by
the
oak
that
being
said
the
sourness
and
sweetness
come
together
well
a
moderate
feel
with
good
carbonation
again
the
sweet
and
sour
balance
each
other
out
on
the
palate
perhaps
a
light
grassy
hop
pops
through
towards
the
end
id
probably
like
to
see
more
yeasty
flavor
and
a
touch
more
hops
but
the
flavors
are
quite
good
and
mellow
its
different
and
its
good
this
complex
as
hell
an
excellent
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
i
raise
my
glass
from
my
tasting
notes
the
belgo
belgian
style
ipa
poured
a
dark
gold
with
a
white
head
i
let
it
sit
and
warm
to
allow
all
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
to
reveal
themselves
you
get
the
signature
belgian
yeast
aroma
of
sweet
cloves
and
bananas
with
a
bit
of
hops
as
well
the
taste
was
complex
with
the
belgian
yeast
hitting
you
first
with
the
bitter
hops
on
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
smooth
on
this
well
balanced
beer
which
made
the
belgo
dangerously
easy
to
drink
considering
its
8
abv
not
bad
as
with
most
belgian
yeast
fermented
ipas
the
yeast
character
clashes
a
bit
with
the
ample
hop
character
i
find
that
a
beer
like
this
is
better
as
the
second
or
third
though
i
rarely
get
to
that
point
of
an
evening
still
i
will
always
have
a
hankering
for
a
nice
hoppy
belgian
ale
and
i
am
quite
enjoying
this
one
a
kind
of
like
the
light
spices
that
come
through
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
i
have
never
been
one
for
india
pale
ales
but
after
trying
this
one
i
might
have
to
give
them
another
try
the
belgian
yeast
and
also
the
really
great
smelling
hopsin
they
put
in
here
give
it
a
very
india
pale
ale
smell
but
unfortunately
dissipates
quickly
after
opening
the
taste
the
real
winner
here
reminds
me
of
great
grapefruit
cut
grass
and
also
a
few
other
fruity
notes
probably
from
the
east
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
little
disappointed
on
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
seem
to
last
very
long
i
think
this
may
be
one
of
if
not
the
best
belgian
ipas
that
i
have
ever
had
it
does
many
things
right
here
from
the
good
balance
of
yeasty
qualities
and
hops
to
the
excellent
aroma
to
the
wellsuited
body
this
beer
may
not
be
a
session
ipa
but
well
worthy
of
seeking
out
if
you
want
something
in
the
belgian
ipa
category
this
is
phenomenal
and
would
hold
up
easily
against
the
likes
of
houblon
chouffe
and
piraat
the
belgo
ipa
is
very
good
the
beer
pours
clear
golden
with
foamy
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
in
my
tulip
glass
the
scent
carries
spice
hints
of
bitter
citrus
with
touches
of
sweet
belgium
malts
the
taste
starts
with
a
zip
of
spice
then
a
hoppy
bitter
citrus
and
sweet
malt
takes
over
and
then
a
peppery
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer

o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
this
is
another
classic
example
where
to
things
that
i
like
by
themselves
arent
incredible
when
combined
i
love
both
belgian
triples
and
american
ipas
but
this
although
interesting
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
although
a
gorgeous
beer
packed
with
flavors
the
notes
dont
really
seem
to
gel
and
the
stupidly
acidic
and
tart
crab
apple
finish
really
only
motivates
me
to
take
another
sip
to
get
that
flavor
out
of
my
mouth
for
a
bit
this
significantly
degrades
what
is
otherwise
a
pretty
sold
beer
i
was
half
expecting
the
standard
ipa
flavor
and
smells
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
change
of
pace
i
might
actually
like
it
better
than
new
belgiums
ranger
ipa
it
doesnt
linger
as
long
thought
it
does
have
a
nice
kick
to
it
at
7
abv
good
beer
interesting
beer
but
not
very
tasty
if
you
enjoy
belgians
and
hops
youll
probably
love
this
this
is
a
very
odd
beast
tropical
sugary
fruit
and
some
american
hop
notes
of
bitter
citrus
with
a
hint
of
pine
on
the
back
end
weird
and
interesting
but
not
outstanding
seems
a
bit
bizarre
o
not
a
bad
showing
from
a
brewery
that
rarely
impresses
me
on
their
brews
outside
their
lips
of
faith
series
this
is
certainly
drinkable
and
i
would
have
one
again
othis
was
a
decent
beer
but
a
touch
on
the
sweet
and
yeasty
side
of
the
style
for
me
the
hops
and
yeast
work
well
together
here
but
i
found
myself
wanting
a
drier
crisper
feel
and
a
little
more
prick
from
the
carbonation
high
marks
for
the
lacing
however
o
one
is
enough
this
is
definitely
belgian
and
an
ipa
many
bipas
are
tnot
blegian
enough
or
not
hoppy
enough
this
one
achieves
both
i
would
order
a
pint
but
i
wont
buy
6
again
i
dont
think
overall
a
good
one
for
new
belgium
really
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
i
could
see
downing
these
in
the
front
yard
with
neighbors
on
a
nice
summer
afternoon
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
would
be
great
on
a

a

slightly

inviting
and
good
looking
and
everything
smells
floral

fresh

not

with

moderately

i

at

a

this

is
extremely
good
m
lighttomedium

crisp
and
dry
as
one
would
expect
from
a
true

ipa
finish
is

and
somewhat
tannic
overall
good
flavor
and
lingering
but
pleasant
aftertaste
decent
not
spectacular
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
overall
a
reasonable
beer
not
sure
id
feel
compelled
to
buy
it
again
though
it
does
hide
its
abv
though
and
is
easy
to
drink
not
sure
id
call
this
a
belgian
ipa
more
like
a
standard
one
a
true
belgian
ipa
should
have
less
hops
and
a
bit
more
complexity
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
is
closer
to
an
american
ipa
than
a
belgian
one
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
that
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
i
bought
this
because
i
saw
that
my
local
store
finally
had
it
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
very
average
looks
like
just
your
basic
beer
and
wasnt
anything
special
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
very
nice
you
pick
up
a
lot
of
tripel
and
ipa
style
scents
the
smell
is
very
sweet
the
taste
was
also
very
nice
the
beer
was
very
hoppy
and
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
not
great
it
has
a
bit
of
crispness
and
thats
about
it
overall
this
beer
is
very
nice
and
tasty
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
bit
unbalanced
as
the
yeast
flavors
overpowered
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
this
is
a
puzzling
combination
that
comes
across
as
confused
chaotic
and
isnt
well
suited
together
o
fruity
and
lighter
take
on
the
style
lots
of
tropical
fruits
and
yeasty
goodness
very
enjoyable
and
quite
easy
drinking
wish
they
distributed
to
the
nynjct
area
well
worth
picking
up
a
six
or
a
case
of
this
nicely
crafted
brew
o
complex
bright
and
refreshing
with
great
drinkability
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
row
but
ill
definitely
be
making
belgo
a
part
of
my
regular
rotation
of
beers
im
glad
they
made
it
a
yearround
offering
mmedium
bodied
medium
carbonation
finish
is
nice
and
dry
tasty
overall
a
great
beer
very
well
done
belgian
ipa
with
a
great
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
to
match
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
belgian
ipa
its
hard
to
put
down
very
refreshing
a
solid
well
done
belgian
ipa
beer
pours
a
nice
mellow
amber
and
gold
color
with
a
tad
of
copper
this
brew
pours
with
the
exact
right
amount
of
lace
and
head
has
a
yeasty
aroma
of
malts
and
bitter
hops
but
goes
down
smooth
beer
is
a
bit
sweet
in
nature
and
relatively
light
for
being
seven
percent
i
was
not
expecting
much
out
of
this
brew
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
nonetheless
o
powerful
starting
and
deep
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
belgo
is
a
bipolar
beer
thats
got
its
down
sides
but
evens
out
to
a
wellbalanced
belgianinfluenced
hoppy
beer
with
a
nice
clean
bitterness
a
good
pairing
with
spicy
pepperonicoated
thickcrusted
pizza
overall
its
a
nice
light
brew
good
for
summer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
i
love
the
addition
of
belgian
yeast
to
a
hoppy
ipa
i
love
this
beer
ill
have
another
overall
a
good
mix
of
a
belgian
ale
and
an
ipa
giving
this
brew
a
nice
smooth
drinkability
ontap
at
the
brewery
an
excellent
version
of
this
relatively
new
style
great
balance
between
american
hops
and
belgian
yeast
character
citrus
lots
of
citrus
orange
pineapple
lime
and
grapefruit
some
complimentary
pine
herbs
bright
floral
notes
the
belgian
yeast
notes
fight
their
way
into
the
mix
with
more
spice
and
citrus
dry
and
evenly
bitter
but
smooth
overall
a
little
weak
on
the
hop
character
it
is
a
nice
belgian
style
beer
though
making
it
nicely
drinkable
d
a
well
crafted
belgian
style
ale
though
i
might
be
inclined
to
question
its
ipa
pedigree
the
hop
character
is
lacking
both
in
its
intensity
and
its
american
character
there
are
hints
of
pine
but
most
of
the
hop
flavor
gets
lost
in
the
spicy
yeast
notes
o
i
understand
this
is
a
controversial
style
and
so
frankly
this
beer
isnt
getting
the
recognition
it
deserves
it
is
a
perfect
blend
of
the
two
styles
i
am
thrilled
to
have
it
available
and
will
buy
it
as
often
as
i
can
and
hope
to
keep
it
in
stock
i
thought
this
was
quite
solid
liked
the
crispness
and
good
flavors
o
a
nice
drink
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
the
style
good
fruity
candy
flavor
that
avoids
becoming
too
syrupy
solid
presence
of
yeasty
spice
poured
into
a
snifter
it
has
an
awesome
body
to
it
slightly
cloudy
plenty
of
carbonation
light
lacing
and
a
slight
burnt
orange
hue
to
it
all
topped
off
with
a
nice
white
fluffy
and
creamy
head
that
lasts
quite
a
while
the
hops
are
very
present
in
the
aroma
there
a
fruity
aromas
mixed
in
as
well
i
can
pick
up
some
grape
fruit
apple
a
slight
grape
aroma
and
its
got
a
fairly
clean
smell
to
it
its
light
to
medium
bodied
the
hops
are
quite
flavorful
but
not
over
powering
it
has
some
slightly
bitter
flavors
mixed
in
with
some
apple
and
orange
overall
its
sweet
with
a
semiharsh
aftertaste
that
has
a
hint
of
alcohol
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
this
is
another
good

a

a

in

a
little
funky
aroma
that
gets
in
the
taste
hoppy
belgian
taste
tasting
as
it
should
a
dry
finish
a
little
pepper
needs
a
bit
bolder
flavour
or
complexity
just
not
outstanding
or
greatly
drinkable
o
a
fine
example
of
the
style
well
done
final
thoughts
only
78
a
sixer
nice
7
abv
and
just
all
around
awesome
once
again
another
new
belgium
beer
that
has
the
notes
of
fat
tire
in
it
i
really
think
all
of
them
do
initial
taste
is
more
like
pilsner
than
bpa
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
and
a
bit
of
heat
going
down
nice
lacing
continues
throughout
a
bit
of
tannin
on
the
tongue
i
the
finish
a
little
thin
on
taste
again
sweet
banana
most
prominent
but
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
good
for
belgian
fix
at
a
decent
price
for
a
sixer
overall
an
above
average
brew
that
has
some
nice
vibrant
flavours
its
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
so
im
not
sure
how
many
i
could
have
on
one
sitting
it
seems
to
be
a
little
more
on
the
american
ipa
side
of
the
spectrum
than
the
belgian
as
well
definitely
one
of
the
better
belgian
styles
ive
had
from
new
belgium
brewing
co
belgian
ipas
are
hard
to
make
right
and
they
did
a
good
job
here
smooth
tasty
and
i
approve
pretty
good
belgian
ipa
the
hop
notes
come
in
strong
and
work
well
with
the
belgian
side
of
things
o
this
was
a
great
representation
of
the
belgian
ipa
which
is
a
style
that
im
starting
to
come
around
to
clear
golden
yellow
pour
with
about
2
of
creamy
white
head
tons
of
sticky
lacing
smells
of
orange
peel
coriander
soapdetergent
pine
bitter
earth
flavor
up
front
followed
by
a
bitter
sweet
orange
peel
taste
a
little
too
bitter
with
the
hops
to
be
able
to
determine
the
other
flavors
has
a
slight
zest
to
it
light
to
medium
bodied
watery
at
first
but
then
gets
creamy
and
coats
your
tongue
with
a
heavier
body
nicely
carbonated
creates
a
subtle
fizz
on
the
roof
of
your
mouth
overall
a
nice
thirst
quencher
has
a
dry
bitter
finish
feels
like
it
should
be
a
session
beer
but
at
7
abv
i
would
be
careful
a
high
quality
beer
but
its
seems
much
more
belgian
pale
than
a
hybrid
with
an
america
ipa
like
a
belgian
trippel
tastes
like
a
belgian
trippel
with
extra
hops
on
the
back
end
similar
to
another
raging
bitch
ive
been
with
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
with
mild
carbontaion
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
new
belgium
brewing
co
never
disappoints
me
o
this
is
a
great
beer
a
really
smooth
ipa
that
has
a
big
full
body
it
hardly
tastes
like
the
7
abv
labled
on
the
bottle
and
if
i
didnt
know
that
id
be
tempted
to
call
this
a
session
beer
a
pale
amber
color
with
a
fair
white
head
and
modest
specs
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
nice
peach
cobbler
and
wheat
clove
pretty
interesting
and
likeable
the
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
and
gentle
citrus
hop
with
vanilla
clove
body
is
about
medium
with
goodly
carbonation
that
makes
for
a
lively
feel
that
drinks
easy
not
highly
memorable
but
enjoyable
enough
to
recommend
i
would
drink
again
but
not
quite
in
my
wheelhouse
for
this
style
this
is
a
decent
belgian
ipa
the
heavy
yeasty
character
is
blended
well
with
the
hop
character
that
gives
it
a
clean
citrusy
refreshing
flavor
i
will
try
this
again
pretty
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
beer
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
in
many
ways
it
represents
the
best
of
both
worlds
the
refreshing
citrusy
flavors
of
a
belgium
ale
and
the
hoppy
high
alcohol
content
of
an
american
ipa
well
done
highly
recommended
especially
to
novices
like
myself
who
are
intrigued
by
the
compelxity
of
ipas
but
occasionally
find
them
to
be
a
bit
harsh
and
heavy
on
the
palate
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
have
never
had
a
belgian
yeast
ipa
a
very
different
ipa
than
i
was
expecting
simple
yet
complex
and
fairly
imaginative
in
flavor
d
a
solid
american
interpretation
of
the
style
absolutely
stellar
appearance
the
nose
and
flavor
are
solid
but
a
bit
understated
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
sharp
overall
is
a
solidly
above
average
belgian
ipa
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
a
bit
void
in
the
middle
though
warming
does
challenge
that
perspective
offers
a
unique
orange
character
throughout
the
palate
finish
is
floral
and
spicy
yet
not
very
bitter
slightly
coarse
in
nature
and
bready
this
beer
finishes
with
a
peppery
clove
flavor
more
belgo
than
ipa
yet
pleasant
and
never
abrasive
as
i
struggle
to
grasp
the
wide
range
of
brews
that
fall
into
this
style
i
think
i
like
this
one
hoppy
yet
not
overly
bitter
and
in
balance
with
a
malt
character
that
is
well
accentuated
by
the
yeast
esters
more
subtle
and
delicate
than
a
certain
raging
bitch
i
know
o
drinkable
but
pretty
average
overall
this
beer
seems
confused
it
has
the
flavor
of
a
pleasant
session
beer
but
its
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
noticeable
in
general
for
that
a
bolder
flavor
profile
would
really
help
this
a
lot
as
it
stands
not
bad
but
not
great
overall
liked
it
al
lot
id
buydrink
it
again
my
only
gripe
with
this
beer
is
that
theres
a
harsh
aftertaste
more
so
than
what
most
ipas
have
o
the
best
of
both
worlds
this
beer
is
an
ipa
and
a
belgian
beer
in
one
its
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
definetly
a
must
o
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
of
the
year
i
am
obviously
a
big
fan
of
hoppy
beers
and
as
far
as
hoppy
beers
go
this
one
has
chosen
wisely
and
delivered
a
great
complex
yet
very
enjoyable
beer
like
some
of
the
other
great
belgium
styles
from
europe
poured
from
bottle
stamped
13may12
to
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
dece
1
finger
white
head
some
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
very
belgian
dominated
with
strong
banana
and
clove
character
a
noticeable
sweet
malt
essence
as
well
as
perhaps
a
hint
of
apple
not
alcohol
detected
a
mild
earthy
hop
character
the
flavor
starts
crisp
with
a
strong
bite
that
gradually
mellows
to
a
blend
of
earthen
hops
sweet
malt
banana
clove
and
apple
flavor
medium
bitterness
again
no
alcohol
detected
the
flavor
is
sharp
overly
so
in
my
opinion
as
it
distracts
from
an
otherwise
enjoyable
beer
finishes
crisp
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
outstanding
glad
i
purchased
only
the
1
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
i
was
hoping
the
belgian
quality
would
add
complexity
but
no
luck
poured
a
rocky
mountain
looking
head
which
its
craters
and
hills
filled
the
entire
top
of
my
glass
as
the
head
slowly
sunk
into
the
beer
it
left
beautiful
fluffs
of
lacing
behind
smells
of
resiny
hopsbanana
citrus
fruits
such
as
tangerine
and
orange
peel
earthyness
and
piney
this
ipa
brought
the
whole
party
with
it
and
is
here
for
business
first
flavour
that
caught
my
attention
was
the
spices
that
touch
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
quickly
trails
behind
an
explosion
of
hops
bananas
citrus
bitter
on
the
tongue
but
complements
the
fruityness
of
this
beer
slightly
dry
finish
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
lot
going
on
very
well
balanced
ipa
thumbs
up
my
fellow
hop
heads
this
ones
complex
and
rich
and
well
worth
a
try
it
may
not
be
my
favorite
new
belgium
brew
but
its
certainly
good
more
malt
could
help
this
one
some
to
hide
the
alcohol
and
balance
out
the
hops
but
that
nb
biscuit
note
is
already
in
there
so
i
dont
think
that
would
improve
my
overall
impression
hops
are
coming
in
droves
but
the
dankness
comes
off
like
its
a
bit
old
and
contributes
alot
to
the
bitterness
belgian
character
is
perfectly
balanced
and
adds
a
good
dimension
to
what
would
otherwise
be
a
very
basic
ipa
overall
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
it
has
qualities
of
saison
but
defiantly
is
more
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
i
like
it
a
lot
as
a
whole
experience
super
drinkable
too
d
this
is
a
surprisingly
decent
beer
particularly
as
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
considering
this
has
widespread
availability
and
a
reasonable
price
id
actively
recommend
it
for
those
just
getting
into
craft
beer
ooverall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
it
reminds
me
of
the
belgium

brewed
in
the
summer

is

excellent

really
good

continues
to
keep
their
focus
on
quality
good
for
them
overall
4

despite
that
i
think
it
needs
a
little
more
balance
in
the
body
i
enjoy
this
beer
in
fact
its
one
of
those
that
with
every
sip
it
gets
better
that
might
just
be
the
7
talking
o
overall
i
thought
it
wasnt
too
bad
of
a
beer
the
beer
tastes
like
a
close
approximation
of
a
belgian
ipa
but
just
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
again
its
better
than
many
beers
out
there
but
it
just
tastes
unfinished
o
a
good
beer
all
around
and
at
a
solid
price
definitely
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
though
id
like
a
bit
crisper
body
and
more
hop
presence
in
the
nose
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
definitely
sessionable
but
not
my
first
choice
at
all
ipas
still
are
not
my
thing
but
naturally
i
have
understood
why
they
are
so
popular
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
off
white
head
excellent
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
snifter
glass
its
fairly
clear
in
appearance
the
nose
is
really
nice
peach
pear
spice
hops
really
extremely
balanced
and
very
nice
the
flavor
is
the
same
profile
but
its
not
as
complex
as
the
best
belgians
in
this
style
feel
is
nicely
carbonated
with
a
very
dry
fruity
finish
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
you
can
find
better
in
the
style
cheers
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
with
a
persistent
albeit
flat
head
complex
spicy
grassy
aroma
with
notes
cinnamon
fades
to
an
aroma
of
cooked
canned
vegetables
tastes
a
little
better
than
it
smells
nicely
peppery
and
spicy
hop
flavors
mingle
well
with
belgian
yeast
esters
but
the
lingering
aroma
of
cooked
cauliflower
lingers
and
spoils
it
a
bit
i
do
appreciate
the
lean
body
and
dry
finish
though
good
brew
good
to
see
new
belgium
is
still
creating
good
beers
overall
i
have
not
had
many
good
beers
in
this
style
they
too
often
lean
too
far
on
the
funky
or
hoppy
side
this
is
a
bit
too
yeasty
with
little
solid
hop
character
onew
belgium
does
a
solid
job
of
making
consistently
good
brews
i
flew
with
one
of
their
sales
reps
and
he
comped
me
a
free
beer
so
i
try
and
pick
up
a
6
pack
from
time
to
time
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
pizza
to
make
every
bite
of
a
good
pie
a
great
experience
i
recommend
it
ive
had
better
belgian
ipas
again
stone
but
for
the
price
and
availability
this
is
a
really
good
beer
o
this
is
my
first
foray
into
belgian
ipas
i
did
enjoy
this
but
i
dont
know
that
its
a
style
i
would
reach
for
very
often
still
a
nice
brew
oall
a
nice
hoppy
ipa
but
belgian
character
muddies
the
picture
rather
than
enhances
it
for
me
medium
on
thin
with
moderate
carb
and
some
decent
slick
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
the
one
flavor
that
kills
it
for
me
overall
in
this
beer
wish
i
could
pinpoint
it
but
nonetheless
its
a
no
go
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
i
probably
wouldnt
go
pick
it
up
at
the
store
over
any
of
the
other
beers
i
like
to
get
somewhat
regularly
but
would
enjoy
this
in
a
mix
pack
or
if
someone
offered
me
one
overall
i
felt
like
i
was
mixing
2
different
beers
here
impressed
with
the
balance
between
hoppiness
and
funkiness
very
crisp
and
refreshing
very
sessionable
even
with
the
higher
abv
it
is
usually
a
hit
or
miss
with
new
belgium
and
i
would
definitely
hit
this
again
i
was
going
to
try
to
follow
this
with
another
ipa
for
a
taste
comparison
but
i
put
that
one
back
as
i
didnt
think
i
could
appreciate
it
after
the
belgo
although
i
did
treat
myself
to
a
second
belgo
overall
this
beer
has
some
good
qualities
but
the
taste
is
only
average
for
a
belgian
ipa
it
is
not
nearly
in
the
same
league
as
gems
such
as
lupulus
or
duvel
triple
hop
the
belgian
and
ipa
aspects
are
not
well
integrated
but
seem
to
be
in
conflict
with
one
another
this
has
a
tart
taste
to
it
theres
some
wheatyness
to
it
a
slight
bitter
bite
true
to
the
name
it
has
a
bitter
hop
taste
mixed
with
a
belgium
wheat
solid
and
well
made

to
its
ever
growing
award
winning
lineup
in
2011
this
bottle
conditioned
brew
rolls
in
at
7
abv
and
is
chock
full
of
amarillo
cascade
centennial
and
simcoe
hops
belgo
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
with
a
rocky
white
head
and
tons
of
small
bubbles
from
the
bottle
conditioning
lacing
is
there
but
very
light
a
bright
bouquet
of
piney
and
spicy
hops
are
underlined
with
estery
yeasty
notes
from
the
belgian
strain
a
thin
light
to
lightmedium
body
is
in
tune
with
the
lowlevel
carbonation
a
bit
of
belgian
funk
greets
the
pallet
in
the
beginning
but
quickly
gives
way
to
more
assertive
hop
flavors
that
linger
throughout
the
finish
a
great
beer
to
sip
and
to
share
the
body
was
pretty
typical
for
an
ipa
mediumish
and
except
for
the
yeasty
spice
lingering
had
a
clean
finish
drinkability
was
terrible
due
to
the
weird
flavoring
overall
a
substandard
brew
from
a
brewery
that
if
it
rarely
thrills
even
more
rarely
completely
misses
i
got
no
joy
from
this
beer
and
cant
recommend
it
poured
from
a
12

into
a

it

light
straw

transparent
a
big

white
head
rests
on
top
and
lightly
laces
the
glass
big
belgian
funk
its
not
the
p
funk
but
i
still
want
to
get
funked
up
mild
hop
aroma
this
has
a
surprisingly
good
hop
taste
that
accompanies
this
spicy
complexity
of
the
yeast
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
finally
got
around
to
trying
a
bottle
wow
i
am
impressed
the
good
qualities
of
my
favorite
regular
new
belgium
beer
the
trippel
plus
a
huge
spicy
hit
and
the
aromatic
hops
beer
is
surprisingly
hoppy
given
the
aroma
was
nearly
absent
earthy
grinding
good
dry
finish
quite
carbonated
on
the
palate
strong
finish
nice
id
have
it
again
i
got
a
six
pack
ill
drink
the
whole
thing
o
a
bit
lighter
and
not
as
powerful
as
some
of
the
other
belgian
ipas
i
regularly
enjoy
raging
bitch
for
example
but
its
lighter
body
and
clean
flavors
make
it
more
drinkable
than
others
and
the
belgian
influence
is
spot
on
a
decent
easytodrink
belgian
ipa
i
must
confess
that
despite
my
love
for
ipas
and
belgian
ales
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
i
still
dont
think
it
is
that
great
compared
to
other
beers
of
the
same
style
not
bad
a
little
bland
but
a
reasonable
amount
of
flavor
and
good
attenuation
recommended
for
a
change
of
pace
admittedly
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
for
some
reason
despite
that
i
like
belgians
and
ipas
albeit
on
absolute
terms
this
is
a
beer
that
wont
overwhelm
the
enthusiast
but
then
perfect
for
someone
not
familiar
with
craft
beer
or
this
style
can
drink
this
beer
anytime
anywhere
and
thats
probably
the
appeal
been
looking
to
try
this
guy
for
some
time
now
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
lightcreamwhite
froth
a
few
fingers
tall
and
i
dont
remember
shaking
it
at
all
the
nose
comprises
pine
needles
aplenty
melon
rind
grapefruit
rind
and
banana
the
taste
holds
notes
of
honey
banana
light
grapefruit
zest
light
honeydew
light
watermelon
and
rather
light
caramel
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
feel
overall
a
solid
bipa
though
nothing
to
write
home
about
its
pretty
tasty

sugary

nice
taste
is
good
too
the
bitter
hops
meld
well
with
the
yeast
and
spices
a
surprising
balance
really
good
mouthfeeel
not
boring
and
importantly
not
cloying
overall
a
nice
belgian
ipa
o
definitely
a
favorite
of
mine
i
like
the
way
the
citrusy
hops
work
together
with
the
yeast
and
wheatlike
characters
the
amber
colored
body
was
clear
and
the
head
was
one
finger
thick
the
smell
was
quite
hoppy
with
clean
grapefruit
aroma
the
belgian
yeast
showed
up
in
hints
of
banana
clove
and
orange
peel
the
taste
was
not
quite
as
layered
as
the
smell
i
could
taste
some
white
pepper
hay
rock
candy
and
lemon
peel
the
body
felt
a
touch
watered
down
and
thin
the
hops
lingered
in
the
finish
an
easy
drinking
take
on
this
emerging
style
sessionable
pretty
forward
with
the
hop
character
and
story
the
yeast
wants
to
tell
both
meld
well
rather
than
clash
really
good
drinking
here
o
okay
probably
wont
have
this
again
o
not
a
bad
ipa
but
not
very
belgian
and
not
too
much
out
of
the
run
of
the
mill
superbly
made
beer
it
was
really
a
wonder
to
drink
the
combinations
of
taste
smell
and
mouthfeel
are
oneoffs
d
could
be
really
good
if
they
toned
down
the
bitterness
overall
i
would
say
that
this
belgian
ipa
has
all
the
requisite
building
blocks
for
the
style
yet
again
lacks
the
panache
that
makes
belgians
and
faux
belgians
unique
to
the
style
all
substance
and
no
style
i
guess
belgo
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
worth
picking
up
from
my
sampling
the
above
section
i
think
sums
it
up
well
with
soft
the
concept
and
marketing
are
brash
so
live
up
to
it
bought
a
6
pack
for
around
9
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
great
aroma
to
it
taste
is
hoppy
with
the
typical
belgian
yeasts
and
fruitiness
flavors
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
and
is
actually
really
tasty
new
belgium
has
a
solid
line
up
of
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
it
wont
let
you
down
drinkability
surprisingly
tasty
beer
that
is
deliciously
hoppy
and
a
welcome
surprise
at
this
place
im
starting
to
like
these
belgium
ipas
more
and
more
and
this
is
a
better
version
of
the
style
nice
beer
o
this
would
be
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
which
is
what
it
is
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
but
they
call
it
a
belgian
ipa
and
although
it
shouldnt
be
a
hot
hammer
like
an
aipa
the
hops
really
take
a
back
seat
and
just
peak
through
at
times
if
you
are
going
to
call
it
an
ipa
you
need
to
feature
hops
a
bit
more
not
a
bad
beer
one
that
i
would
enjoy
again
but
it
falls
short
in
the
style
overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
and
you
can
defiantly
tell
that
it
is
of
the
belgian
persuasion
with
its
unique
yeast
characteristics
it
looks
great
in
a
glass
and
it
goes
down
very
easily
the
abv
may
be
a
little
high
to
turn
this
into
a
session
brew
but
it
really
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
by
itself
i
also
had
one
with
some
thanksgiving
leftovers
and
it
paired
up
with
that
nicely
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
as
with
a
lot
of
the
belgian
style
ales
from
this
brewery
i
would
highly
recommend
it
as
a
way
to
get
into
this
style
very
good
beer
this
ipa
has
a
strong
yeast
presence
very
tannic
and
spiced
with
bitter
herbal
flavors
that
carry
a
light
amount
of
astringency
into
the
taste
the
flavor
is
light
on
malt
with
a
heavy
dose
of
phenols
in
the
yeast
flavor
kind
of
fruity
in
a
tangy
sort
of
way
perhaps
citrus
if
you
look
for
it
but
in
the
general
not
as
flavored
with
hops
as
it
is
bitter
and
the
citrus
is
muted
by
the
spice
of
the
yeast
overall
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
feel
this
missed
the
mark
and
was
just
average
for
the
style
i
probably
would
try
it
again
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
that
i
have
tried
i
enjoy
new
belgiums
ranger
and
expected
to
see
more
of
its
flavor
profile
come
through
in
the
belgopa
but
to
make
a
metaphor
its
like
meeting
the
relative
of
a
good
friend
and
hitting
it
offtheres
some
similarities
but
enough
differences
to
make
it
unique
and
able
to
stand
on
its
own
merits
overall
a
very
fine
beer
i
have
not
been
too
impressed
from
new
belgium
beers
so
far
but
this
one
is
a
very
finely
crafted
beer
skip
the
hype
of
the
fat
tire
this
one
is
the
winner
overall
its
fine
its
not
like
it
didnt
work
out
for
me
but
i
just
found
it
to
be
merely
soso
served
at
a
good
temp
with
a
nice
off
white
fine
head
that
lasts
forever
and
loads

flavors
a
lot
like
nose
pretty
dry
a
bit
fruity
but
mainly
hop
bitter
body
is
faultless
ditto
carbonatiion
finish
is
like
flavor
of
average
length
and
fairly
balanced
decent
brew
d
part
of
me
wants
to
say
this
drinks
like
an
ipa
with
a
belgian
yeasty
twist
and
the
other
part
wants
to
say
this
drinks
like
a
belgian
golden
with
a
healthy
dose
of
american
hops
regardless
of
categories
this
is
a
good
tasting
brew
from
nb
o
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
new
belgium
beers
and
better
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
based
on
nbs
other
regular
lineup
up
i
think
they
should
consider
adding
this
to
the
year
round
mix
o
havent
had
lots
of
belgian
ipas
before
this
was
a
good
drink
but
nothing
made
it
great
good
flavors
and
nicely
put
together
would
maybe
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
sometime
as
it
was
easy
to
drink
a
nice
take
on
a
belgian
pale
from
the
folks
at
new
belgium
definitely
a
must
try
notes
not
extraordinary
but
very
well
rounded
it
feels
like
we
are
hitting
a
well
recognized
standard
for
what
is
minimally
expected
of
a
quality
belgium

this
works

good

well

lightly

here
in

this
was
brough

which
is
quite
a
shame
because
every
brew
ive
had
thus
far
of
theirs
has
been
quite
good
this
is
an
excellent

plenty
of

the
hops
definitely
one
youll
want
to
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
go
on
but
i
must
get
back
to
drinking
o
very
drinkable
beer
i
think
ill
have
another
this
is
a
classy
beer
and
makes
one
feel
classy
nice
enough
but
i
wouldnt
make
a
point
of
seeking
it
out
again
o
a
serviceable
beer
but
not
what
i
wanted
nor
expected
based
on
the
label
taste
is
hops
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
nice
round
offsweet
belgian
character
but
then
if
finishes
with
a
terrible
watery
mouthfeel
that
really
has
a
bad
effect
on
the
brew
overall
decent
but
probably
the
least
impressive
bipa
ive
had
so
far
overall
this
is
a
style
i
like
and
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
i
enjoy
the
malt
profile
that
accompanies
the
amount
of
hops
bitterness
this
beer
does
a
decent
job
of
mixing
the
two
much
better
on
tap
then
in
the
bottle
o
what
a
difference
compared
to
my
previous
experiences
although
it
shouldnt
be
surprising
that
the
best
beers
a
brewery
named
new
belgium
puts
out
are
their
belgian
ones
it
certainly
shocked
me
craft
beer
always
has
a
way
of
catching
you
offguard
which
is
one
of
the
things
i
love
about
it
and
new
belgium
you
just
hit
me
with
a
dose
of
belgian
love
that
i
wont
soon
forget
lips
of
faith
here
i
come
other
comments
its
like
a
cross
between
an
american
ipa
and
a
duvel
yummy
o
i
almost
like
it
but
not
quite
ive
always
disliked
that
belgian
yeasts
flavor
though
that
taste
is
pretty
over
powering
here
not
leaving
room
for
many
other
flavors
o
this
is
probably
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
had
i
havent
had
many
though
it
offers
up
a
good
amount
of
belgian
yeasty
goodness
and
a
very
good
malt
backbone
however
i
wish
the
hops
werent
so
crowded
out
by
the
yeast
also
the
skunky
aromas
were
a
little
off
putting
but
overall
a
solid
offering
from
new
belgium
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
i
picked
this
up
on
whim
at
the
nearby
grocery
store
but
it
turned
out
to
be
pretty
tasty
well
worth
trying
nice
amber
hue
with
persistant
lacing
that
firmly
resisted
gravity
nice
aroma
not
overpowering
slight
scent
of
a
fermenting
fruit
bowl
a
mixture
of
tropical
and
citrus
taste
still
had
a
faint
biscuit
flavor
that
tips
off
the
brewers
origin
new
belgium
nice
spice
maybe
some
anise
and
coriander
only
slightly
stringent
bitter
aftertaste
the
exceptional
balance
of
all
of
these
qualities
are
what
make
this
an
excellent
beer
it
will
be
a
regular
offering
in
my
home
for
guests
the
aroma
was
full
of
yeast
and
spice
with
a
very
nice
light
fruit
vibe
coming
off
of
it
lots
of
peaches
and
pears
were
readily
apparent
and
easily
transferred
the
aroma
into
one
of
a
nice
belgian
pale
there
was
a
large
amount
of
hops
present
on
the
nose
as
well
what
seemed
like
citrus
a
touch
of
alcohol
was
present
hidden
under
all
of
this
as
well
but
it
served
more
to
round
out
then
to
distract
huge
hoppy
flavor
coming
off
of
it
nice
fruity
flavors
worked
their
way
in
lots
of
peaches
and
pears
apples
and
a
touch
of
orange
probably
coriander
starting
to
break
through
a
good
amount
of
yeast
gave
way
to
a
nice
dry
hoppy
finish
that
was
accented
by
some
grape
like
flavors
in
the
end
notes
great
belgian
ipa
fruity
and
spices
are
all
present
but
nothing
is
too
intense
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
great
flavors
coming
out
wonderful
overall
plus
i
really
like
the
label
pours
a
clear
light
honey
orange
with
a
3
inch
puffy
white
head
that
settles
to
an
island
of
chunky
foam
a
nice
latticework
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
first
and
foremost
of
a
typical
belgian
yeast
along
with
some
spices
and
malt
aromas
i
am
not
really
getting
any
typical
ipa
smells
from
this
one
it
smells
more
like
a
witbierhefeweizen
hybrid
than
anything
taste
is
of
citrus
fruits
and
citrus
zest
up
front
along
with
a
malt
backbone
and
a
clean
belgian
yeast
flavor
on
the
finish
a
mild
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
with
a
smooth
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
good
belgian
take
on
an
ipa
the
smell
is
deceiving
however
as
it
does
not
really
identify
that
what
you
are
about
to
drink
has
any
ipa
qualities
to
it
this
is
a
fine
belgian
ipa
but
nothing
i
would
pick
up
again
to
quick
a
little
light
on
the
hops
for
my
taste
needs
a
touch
more
dry
hopping
o
if
i
just
pretend
the
belgian
part
of
the
beer
didnt
exist
then
this
would
be
a
great
ipa
falls
short
of
other
belgian
ipas
ive
tasted
but
this
one
makes
much
economical
sense
7
99
a
six
pack
a
great
belgian
ipa
this
will
now
be
my
go
to
for
the
style
tasty
highly
recommend
o
a
nice
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
first
non
lips
of
faith
beer
that
i
have
really
liked
from
new
belgium
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
pours
a
golden
body
with
a
rich
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
properties
th
aromas
are
predominantly
of
citrus
hops
but
the
belgian
yeast
definitely
imparts
the
smell
of
cotton
candy
and
tropical
fruits
tastewise
the
front
palate
is
hopforward
before
quickly
giving
way
to
caramelly
malts
and
fruitier
elements
such
as
pineapple
kiwis
and
something
reminiscent
of
strawberries
the
overall
yeastiness
feels
very
belgian
i
wish
that
the
finish
didnt
wasnt
so
lemony
it
seems
inconsistent
with
overall
candied
sweetness
and
fruity
character
of
the
beer
to
end
on
such
a
bitter
note
but
it
doesnt
wreck
it
loved
this
beer
first
experience
with
a
beldium
ipa
and
im
pretty
sure
im
gonna
try
a
batch
myself
why
dont
more
breweries
do
this
note
to
new
belgium
please
bring
your
beer
to
new
york
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
smells
and
looks
wonderful
the
flavors
just
didnt
match
up
well
with
the
nose
everything
was
there
just
a
bit
vague
and
unorganized
and
lite
it
makes
for
easy
drinking
though
i
would
buy
this
again
belgo
has
a
nice
if
overly
sweet
flavor
however
the
strong
yeast
presence
and
weak
feel
makes
it
more
like
a
poor
belgian
ale
than
a
middleoftheroad
ipa
either
way
there
are
much
better
options
overall
its
not
as
good
as
their
ranger
ipa
but
is
certainly
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying
as
well
as
being
a
good
value
overall
decent
but
lacking
in
character
i
probably
wouldnt
purchase
this
again
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
these
guys
in
a
long
time
reminds
a
lot
of
tank
7
in
many
ways
just
about
as
good
well
done
new
belgium
o
brilliant
effort
buy
the
fellows
at
nb
refreshing
flavorful
and
not
overly
heavy
while
carrying
tons
of
flavor
and
depth
i
will
say
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
most
of
the
belgians
i
think
its
something
about
the
yeasts
and
others
that
make
me
not
the
biggest
fan
i
will
say
that
i
do
appreciate
the
style
this
bursts
of
wild
yeasts
and
hops
a
nice
golden
to
pale
straw
color
in
the
glass
with
a
huge
frothy
head
that
almost
burst
out
of
the
glass
this
had
a
nice
smooth
feel
to
it
and
was
extremely
drinkable
for
a
7er
i
will
say
that
having
this
right
next
to
the
ranger
and
looking
at
the
botle
im
just
a
bigger
fan
of
the
hop
profile
in
the
ranger
it
had
a
lot
more
going
for
it
but
obviously
that
is
the
focus
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
tight
mouthfeel
dry
and
crisp
making
for
some
very
refreshing
sips
alcohol
bite
in
the
very
back
that
is
mostly
hidden
but
shows
its
head
a
few
times
hops
are
mildly
bitter
but
have
a
nice
flavor
that
vibes
well
with
the
belgian
yeast
that
funk
from
the
smell
is
in
the
taste
mildly
but
adds
a
nice
balance
to
the
pleasant
hops
a
crisp
taste
of
malts
brings
it
full
circle
and
gives
this
beer
a
simple
straightforwardness
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
extreme
but
a
very
enjoyable
take
on
a
style
that
has
a
history
of
going
either
way
i
would
buy
this
again
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
and
will
look
for
it
from
now
on
hazy
brassy
blonde
with
corn
silk
highlights
and
a
million
tiny
susupended
yeast
particles
when
backlit
nice
dank
hoppy
aroma
with
a
small
blast
of
yeasty
funk
piney
hops
with
a
lemon
taffy
sweetness
imparted
by
the
yeast
and
a
solid
malt
backbone
well
balanced
flavors
of
american
ipa
belgian
yeast
which
is
refreshing
as
i
have
grown
tired
of
the
extreme
attempts
at
this
newer
style
finishes
mostly
dry
with
a
hop
oily
mouthfeel
in
the
finish
hey
i
love
good
affordable
beer
and
nbb
belgo
certainly
fits
the
bill
overall
an
excellent
value
like
getting
an
imperial
or
special
edition
at
regular
micro
prices
overall
a
decent
belgian
ipa
except
for
the
soapy
character
pours
clear
golden
with
a
lively
moderately
sticky
head
and
good
streamers
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
pungent
and
phenolic
fruity
and
spicy
but
with
a
solid
pale
malt
backbone
and
an
aspirinlike
tang
the
flavor
is
crisp
with
apple
and
clove
and
coriander
but
a
satisfying
pale
malt
bottomnote
and
a
pleasant
bitter
snap
like
an
acidic
cider
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
this
style
isnt
exactly
in
my
wheelhouse
but
ive
had
a
few
better
executed
beers
of
this
ballpark
of
a
genre
houblon
chouffe
ommegang
bpa
id
personally
prefer
a
sweeter
hop
profile
to
pair
with
the
belgian
yeast
solid
not
amazing
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
it
is
a
little
odd
at
first
and
maybe
even
eccentric
but
that
being
said
i
like
it
nice
interplay
of
yeast
and
hops
wonderfully
flavorful
and
simple
belgian
ipa
for
78
dollars
nothing
overpowering
just
nice
crisp
ipa
with
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
a
beer
thats
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
o
great
blend
of
the
two
styles
its
perfect
if
you
want
a
good
ipa
but
not
something
thats
going
to
slap
you
in
the
face
with
hops
poured
into
a
standard
pint
a
slight
hazed
burnt
orange
infused
golden
with
a
fluffy
12
finger
white
crown
atop
a
burst
of
fresh
citric
hop
really
hit
home
in
the
nose
along
with
toasted
corainder
seedthe
aromas
are
really
fresh
and
bold
sharp
citric
hops
upfront
on
the
palate
followed
by
a
light
yeasty
phenolsthe
phenols
are
kept
in
check
pretty
well
though
with
the
hops
being
the
main
component
a
very
good
bipaamerican
hops
with
just
a
little
yeastinessi
would
buy
again
overall
this
is
an
ipa
i
will
always
look
forward
to
drink
when
i
want
something
a
little
different
than
the
straight
forward
in
you
face
hopped
american
ipa
this
ipa
just
gives
me
some
different
for
a
change
and
does
a
great
job
at
it
this
was
a
very
good
hopforward
variation
of
a
belgian
ipa
still
balance
was
there
and
the
taste
was
very
enjoyable
definitely
one
to
seek
out
and
try
again
the
only
aspect
id
like
to
be
a
bit
more
developed
was
the
aroma
do
while
it
is
unclear
whether
or
not
this
beers
core
is
the
same
as
their
ranger
ipa
new
belgium
has
managed
to
produce
a
worthy
americanbrewed
contribution
to
the
style
its
flavor
profile
is
structured
around
concise
yeast
phenolics
that
face
little
competition
from
hop
aromatics
it
is
a
stylistic
crossover
of
sorts
appearing
as
much
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
as
a
belgian
ipa
it
will
satisfy
the
belgian
beer
enthusiast
more
than
the
west
coasthopped
stone
calibelgique
but
that
other
beer
manages
to
remain
more
true
to
the
ipa
label
do
not
miss
this
beer
this
one
is
unique
its
probably
lovehate
but
for
this
craft
beer
drinking
fool
its
love
all
the
way
enjoy
o
a
nice
brew
really
doesnt
hit
with
much
in
the
way
of
what
id
call
an
ipa
taste
but
is
still
a
nice
smooth
and
crisp
brew
enjoyable
and
overall
good
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
clovey
spiciness
dominates
the
aroma
though
there
is
enough
hop
to
inform
you
that
there
is
more
to
the
beer
the
carbonation
bite
is
aggressive
at
first
but
if
the
beer
is
savored
before
swallowing
there
is
a
nice
malty
back
of
the
mouth
malty
sweetness
that
is
complemented
by
the
clove
the
sweetness
is
balanced
by
hop
bitterness
and
citrus
rind
which
falls
just
short
of
clashing
with
the
clove
or
maybe
it
doesnt
fall
short
close
call
pretty
aggressive
the
finish
is
dry
with
astringency
from
the
hops
and
bite
from
the
carbonation
lingering
update
my
overall
opinion
of
the
quality
of
this
beer
remains
the
same
but
i
did
want
to
qualify
that
my
tastebuds
were
indeed
altered
by
the
fixed
gear
i
drank
before
i
gave
my
review
there
is
a
definite
hops
presence
in
this
beer
still
it
was
interesting
to
have
reviewed
this
beer
with
an
altered
pallete
there
was
plenty
to
discover
beyond
what
the
hops
had
to
say
oddly
i
wasnt
too
enthusiastic
with
the
first
three
bottles
i
tossed
back
for
beer
4
sitting
down
and
really
thinking
aboutim
very
happy
with
this
one
and
will
come
back
for
more
overall
unique
taste
and
very
interesting
and
intriguing
to
sample
o
one
of
the
first
new
belgium
beers
i
have
like
in
awhile
initially
i
did
not
like
the
beer
but
i
think
my
expectations
were
skewed
given
how
much
i
like
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
im
glad
i
bought
ill
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
i
bought
a
six
pack
belgo
is
a
nice
effort
hopefully
it
will
make
it
out
of
the
mixed
pack
it
came
in
and
into
its
own
sixers
d
enjoyable
got
it
in
a
mix
pack
there
are
better
belgian
ipas
but
for
the
price
its
rather
tasty
overall
a
good
beer
all
the
basics
are
there
for
a
belgian
ipa
still
seems
a
little
on
the
raw
side
certainly
worth
the
price
i
paid
for
the
beer
will
buy
again
an
added
benefit
is
the
low
alcohol
level
for
the
style
this
doesnt
have
the
ko
effect
of
say
raging
bitch
a
fusion
of
two
styles
that
you
dont
see
all
the
time
pours
a
very
alive
deep
golden
color
with
a
rising
head
smells
yeasty
and
hoppy
enticing
its
muc
more
of
an
ipa
that
i
thought
it
might
be
these
usually
tend
to
be
european
versions
and
thus
not
as
bold
with
the
hop
additions
not
belgo
though
this
is
an
ipa
through
and
through
with
a
nice
crist
belgian
yeast
finish
not
one
id
probably
drink
every
day
but
a
well
executed
rendition
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
goldcopper
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
earthy

hint
of
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian

mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
earthy

good

belgian

this
one
is
a
must
try
close
your
eyes
take
a
sip
and
you
will
experience
a
great
ipa
that
magically
transforms
into
a
belgian
trippel
amazing
how
new

has
done
this
two

in

new

is
a
master
at
marketing
with
their
quirky
ads
great
beer
names
hard
to
beat
fat
tire
as
a
beer
name
even
though
i
personally
do
not
care
for
that
brew
and
traditional
labels
they
missed
it
with
belgo
the
name
does
nothing
for
me
and
the
label
is
ugly
at
best
but
lets
not
judge
the
beer
by
the
packaging
the
belgo
pours
with
a
honey
colored
body
little
carbonation
and
a
great
pillowy
head
with
fine
lacing
it
looks
fantastic
in
the
glass
and
the
looks
are
outdone
by
the
aroma
which
is
prominent
with
a
complex
blend
of
hops
and
malt
coming
through
lots
of
enjoyment
even
before
you
takes
a
sip
the
flavors
will
blow
you
away
it
starts
out
as
a
fine
ipa
with
lots
of
hops
coming
through
then
mid
sip
transforms
to
a
belgian
style
trippel
malty
yeasty
and
wonderful
the
belgo
is
a
great
find
take
a
six
over
to
your
most
discerning
beer
snob
friend
and
you
will
get
the
pick
of
the
month
award
pale

with
a

flavor
of

is
upfront
carried
by
a
light

mouth
feel
very
refreshing
beer
opened
this
to
very
nice
grapefruit
citrus
smell
and
taste
the
beer
had
a
great
mouth
feel
and
tasted
as
good
coming
in
as
going
down
this
should
be
a
year
round
seller
this
is
one
seasonal
that
should
clearly
be
sold
year
round
already
craving
the
absence
of
accumulation
pours
a
clear
yellow
nice
and
foamy
and
very
refreshing
this
is
my
favorite
part
of
winter
decent
if
not
spectacular
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
purchased
a
six
pack
of
bottles
at
the
store
and
have
twice
gone
back
for
more
very
crisp
with
a
light
mouthfeel
yet
bold
in
flavor
brings
together
a
nice
balance
of
bitterness
and
drinkability
absolutely
loved
it
very
good
ipa
great
winter
beer
pours
gold
with
a
slight
haze
under
a
1
white
foam
cap
that
produces
thin
lace
has
a
grassy
herbal
nose
with
some
fruit
and
bread
the
palate
is
creamy
citrusy
and
fruity
with
traces
of
bread
the
hop
bitterness
is
between
orange
and
tangerine
rind
there
is
a
light
sweetness
that
dries
out
on
the
finish
it
has
a
creamy
wheat
texture
with
medium
body
and
slightly
below
average
carbonation
decent
brew
however
i
expect
better
from
new
belgium
i
can
respect
them
for
thinking
out
of
the
box
in
terms
of
an
ipa
regardless
i
just
found
the
taste
rather
strange
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
amazing
hop
centric
and
fairly
refreshing
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
very
nice
wheat
style
white
ipa
very
enjoyable
unfiltered
wheat
beer
appearance
grapefruit
slightly
harsh
bitterness
similar
in
taste
to
their
ranger
ipa
but
with
a
better
body
easy
drinking
but
not
that
flavorful
hop
presence
on
the
nose
though
enjoyed
smelling
it
more
very
solid
very
crisp
without
that
over
sweet
finish
different
but
good
overall
this
is
a
really
good
refreshing
tasty
beer
i
am
sorry
it
is
only
a
winter
seasonal
crisp
and
clean
very
good
but
not
too
strong
for
a
white
ipa
o
a
very
nice
offering
from
new
belgium
and
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
i
very
much
enjoy
the
drinkability
and
the
light
citrus
and
tropical
notes

im
not
quite
sure
why
i
bought
this
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
always
like
new
belgium
beers
and
this
one
was
above
average
for
sure
not
very
familiar
with
the
white
ipa
style
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i
will
definitely
buy
again
i
cant
put
it
in
to
words
the
best
but
smell
and
flavor
are
top
notch
for
an
ipa
i
wish
they
had
this
for
a
summer
brew
ive
had
a
decent
amount
of
ipas
but
this
one
easily
lands
within
my
top
5
refreshing
wheat
summer
like
ipa
overall
a
solid
white
ipa
per
the
bottle
this
beer
employs
mosaic
and
amarillo
two
of
my
newer
favorite
hops
that
shine
in
this
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
ipa
something
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
in
the
future

i
did
enjoy
this
one
as
others
have
mentioned
it
did
have
a
piney
smell
and
absolutely
a
piney
aftertaste
the
pineyness
i
oddly
enjoyed
it
was
as
if
i
was
drinking
a
liquid
form
of
my
christmas
tree
this
year
the
rest
of
the
flavors
were
mixed
though
i
did
not
notice
any
peanut
butter
as
someone
else
had
mentioned
then
again
i
dont
catch
every
little
nuance
in
smell
and
taste
admittedly
but
it
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
a
good
solid
winter
ale
overall
unsure
about
this
one
i
didnt
expect
the
peanut
butter
and
am
unsure
if
that
was
intentional
the
soapy
smell
wasnt
that
appealing
im
not
thinking
about
coming
back
to
this
one
wish
i
could
find
a
date
on
this
beer
but
i
know
its
this
seasons
batch
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
that
makes
me
think
of
grapefruit
nice
thin
creamy
head
very
pleasant
piney
grapefruit
fragrance
a
very
crisp
light
hoppy
taste
with
lemon
and
grapefruit
hints
finishes
with
a
little
more
prominent
piney
hop
actually
very
refreshing
this
one
surprised
me
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
was
6
2
percent
i
think
more
highly
of
this
one
as
i
think
more
about
it
not
super
complex
not
too
bad
for
a
mass
produced
seasonal
ipa
very
good
with
a
holiday
dinner
very
interesting
the
smell
is
unique
in
its
funkiness
and
the
taste
has
a
bitter
pine
something
going
on
i
like
it
i
dont
know
if
id
get
it
again
though
its
certainly
good
just
unique
interesting
beer
extremely
pale
almost
watery
complexion
decent
head
and
lace
the
smell
is
pungent
musty
hops
tree
ark
mushroom
earth
and
grain
me
nteresting
but
not
great
the
taste
is
dryish
but
no
overly
so
moderate
bitterness
just
okay
i
dont
remember
being
impressed
taste
is
fairly
subdued
its
somewhat
fruity
and
piney
and
not
much
else
not
really
digging
it
its
not
real
bitter
but
it
has
some
bitterness
not
picking
the
spice
in
the
taste
kind
of
blah
i
am
a
new
belgium
fan
boy
but
this
is
darn
good
outlier
detected
please
enter
a
review
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
the
flavor
was
pretty
bland
and
poor
straw
yellow
color
over
all
a
decent
beer
kinda
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
light
beer
rather
than
a
ipa
discovered
my
new
favorite
ipa
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
but
finishes
bitter
extremely
light
and
floral
touch
of
fruit
but
its
subtle
a
very
solid
beer
for
9
a

outlier

doesnt
drink
like
a
belgian
ipa
to
me
which
is
a
good
thing
nice
light
hoppy
brew
with
no
overly
assertive
yeast
or
spice
not
the
greatest
but
for
the
price
it
would
be
something
i
could
take
to
a
holiday
party
where
i
dont
want
to
take
the
best
but
still
want
something
drinkable
accumulation
of
snow
is
not
a
problem
here
but
a
white
ipa
something
extraordinary
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
huge
citrus
waft
of
lemon
orange
and
grapefruit
oils
with
a
nice
sweetness
in
the
background
pours
into
my
trusty
sapp
to
a
slightly
cloudy
watery
bright
yellow
with
a
massive
white
pillowy
head
that
stands
for
what
seems
like
forever
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
a
nice
citrus
hop
bite
that
is
well
balanced
with
a
citrusy
sweetness
the
taste
transitions
to
a
more
bitter
middle
with
sweet
and
bitter
finish
that
is
mostly
clean
mouthfeel
is
light
but
insignificant
due
to
overall
flavor
head
holds
up
all
the
way
through
the
brew
a
nice
light
drinker
with
a
good
flavor
kick
definitely
a
keeper
great
taste
lighter
than
a
hearty
ipa
but
with
a
similar
taste
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
and
sneaky
strong
not
to
bitter
not
too
different
from
a
typical
ipa
but
good
still
overall
impression
a
bit
restrained
for
a
belgian
ipa
needed
more
of
something
but
not
bad
probably
wont
seek
out
again
finally
a
winter
beer
that
isnt
ultra
dark
night
coffee
bourbon
stout
and
a
solid
ipa

boot
medium
bodied
and
pale

big

then
persistent

in
the

are
my

poured
a
bottle
bought
20141207
very
pretty
straw
color
though
none
of
the
touted
unfiltered
cloudiness
smell
absent
and
i
dont
have
a
cold
taste
about
as
much
character
as
your
typical
mall
store
chain
seriously
every
single
time
i
go
back
to
new
belgium
cuz
i
want
to
give
a
good
bicycle
and
environmentadvocating
company
some
shouts
i
am
always
so
disappointed
and
angry
that
i
wasted
cash
and
calories
where
is
the
wheat
i
can
barely
taste
it
but
it
takes
closing
my
eyes
and
searching
for
the
wheat
bitterness
is
present
but
has
no
character
not
grassy
not
floral
not
esterly
so
just
bitter
the
carbonation
is
good
and
fizzy
the
body
is
solid
and
not
thin
but
that
just
doesnt
warrant
the
drinking
this
ale
pours
a
pale
yellow
and
cloudy
leaves
a
nice
fine
head
and
very
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
fresh
and
clean
hops
and
citrus
abound
with
a
prevalent
grapefruit
overtone
the
first
sip
hits
you
with
hops
and
then
the
grapefruit
comes
through
with
a
smooth
slightly
malt
finish
very
clean
mouth
feel
and
quite
smooth
overall
a
nice
winter
offering
from
new

abv
a
bit
too
fruity
tasting
for
my
liking
grapefruity
bitter
finish
rather
have
a
bud
than
this
overall
this
is
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
beer
so
far
i
like
it
better
than
sn
celebration
this
is
high
praise
because
i
really
enjoyed
that
one
as
well
this
beer
will
become
a
yearly
tradition
for
me
going
forward
new
belgium
is
an
excellent
brewer
and
ill
be
trying
more
from
them
in
the
future
disclaimer
im
generally
not
an
ipa
fan
i
dont
order
them
when
out
but
my
curiosity
keeps
me
tasting
so
i
try
to
temper
my
feelings
when
evaluating
good
beer
im
surprised
by
the
overall
rating
should
be
higher
id
say
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
wish
i
could
get
all
yearround
has
a
delightfully
balanced
floralhop
taste
that
makes
for
a
great
have
to
try
beer
initial
flavor
and
aroma
is
ipa
but
the
white
beer
element
gradually
sinks
in
after
a
few
more
sips
plenty
of
citrusy
hopsmostly
lemon
and
limein
the
aftertaste
but
theres
a
good
malt
body
as
well
the
coriander
and
wheat
is
really
nicely
integrated
with
the
hops
o
no
flaws
but
nothing
outstanding
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
at
the
top
of
the
rebuy
list
o
a
good
beer
with
a
decent
hop
profile
and
some
nice
yeast

there
is

so
far
now
for

taste
it

i
would
go
back
to

into

a

palate
is
refreshing
citric
subtly
sweet
i
get
more
of
a
session
ipa
vibe
than
the
expected
witbier
base
at
least
initially
although
there
is
a
solid
undercurrent
of
belgian
seed
spice
and
dry
phenols
grapefruit
lime
and
some
mango
complement
the
lemon
on
the
nose
the
combination
of
belgian
yeast
and
citrus
hops
recalls
ginger
root
in
a
way
body
on
the
low
end
of
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
rather
dry
with
lingering
citrus
rind
clove
and
coriander
notes
i
stand
by
my
earlier
session
assessment
flavorsome
yet
light
and
drinkable
good
balance
between
american
hop
and
belgian
flavors
with
the
former
front
and
center
and
the
latter
playing
a
competent
supporting
role
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
new
belgium
seasonals
and
i
always
grab
at
least
a
couple
of
12packs
to
get
me
through
the
winter
months
overall
i
can
see
this
as
a
good
choice
as
something
in
between
a
bigger
ipa
and
session
ipa
i
just
find
myself
wishing
it
packaged
the
impressive
flavors
with
a
more
substantial
body
that
being
said
i
will
grab
a
few
more
of
these
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
with
a
lighter
feel
o
3
5
just
another
forgettable
seasonal
beer
from
nb
i
wish
theyd
find
something
good
and
stick
with
it
instead
of
giving
us
something
new
every
year
on
tap
at
lalas
the
only
interesting
beer
i
saw
served
in
a
new
belgium
globe
which
was
nice
this
was
a
very
cloudy
yellow
color
aroma
was
interesting
wheat
and
spice
and
hops
flavor
was
a
really
nice
citrusy
lemon
with
hint
of
wheat
this
surprised
me
overall
one
of
the
better
white
ipas
alongside
deschutes
chainbreaker
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
drink
but
isnt
overly
impressive
like
i
said
before
its
your
typical
new
belgium
hoppy
beer
with
a
subtle
kiss
of
wheat
o
a
serviceable
ipa
but
not
a
spectacular
one
light
and
sweet
very
easy
to
drink
o
its
a
solid
white
ipa
but
not
my
style
overall
what
a
surprisingly
great
ipa
im
sure
this
doesnt
get
much
respect
in
the
beer
geek
circles
because
its
new
belgium
and
not
brewed
in
some
dudes
barn
on
a
farm
somewhere
but
its
truly
well
done
the
hop
flavor
is
bright
and
juicy
balanced
nicely
against
a
very
light
crisp
malt
body
maybe
the
only
thing
i
find
off
about
this
release
is
that
its
a
winter
seasonal
when
its
refreshing
crispness
just
screams
summer
tastetropical
fruitpiney
hops
lighter
bodied
but
plenty
of
flavor
and

this
one
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
awhile
maybe
1
year
before
i
purchased
it
it
was
a
bargain
at
roughly
1
im
wondering
if
some
fermentation
didnt
happen
and
now
ive
got
some
diacetyl
going
on
here
overall
though
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
even
though
i
dont
like
ipas
i
can
see
myself
finishing
this
one
not
much
snow
out
there
today
but
when
have
these
seasonals
matched
up
with
reality
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
cloudy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
coriander
pine
needles
light
biscuit
and
grapefruit
zest
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
pine
takes
on
a
bit
of
a
minty
character
on
the
edges
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
decent
white
ipa

im
not
a
fan
of
white
ipas
oenjoyed
the
balance
of
the
beer
the
hops
did
not
overpower
you
yet
was
intense
just
not
as
overpowering
as
some
ipas
overall
im
slowly
getting
used
to
the
idea
of
holiday
or
winter
beers
being
something
lighter
or
hoppier
this
one
is
refreshing
while
still
offering
notions
of
holiday
flavors
overall
a
great
ipa
white
ipas
were
a
trend
that
leveled
off
this
year
but
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
definitely
more
assertive
with
the
hops
than
the
masses
aroma
is
great
makes
for
a
brighter
winter
season
ignore
the
nb
hate
and
give
it
a
try
this
is
my
goto
beer
for
enjoying
with
asian
food
when
its
available
love
this
ipa
by
nb
i
think
their
ipas
dont
get
enough
credit
nice
job
on
this
one
overall
a
fairly
nice
and
tasty
ipa
with
a
good
blend
of
citrus
hop
and
drier
malt
with
a
body
and
aroma
that
produce
a
rather
nice
drinking
brew
overall
and
somewhat
better
than
their
fat
tire
ale
despite
other
reviews
after
drinking
i
get
what
they
are
going
for
in
this
white
ipa
its
cold
crisp
and
has
stone
fruit
and
pineapple
undertones
just
like
the
weather
this
is
a
crisp
finishing
white
ipa
that
is
imo
a
welcome
change
to
the
hearty
filling
winter
warmers
that
are
released
en
masse
this
time
of
year
good
change
of
pace
and
a
welcome
refreshment
that
appears
to
a
wider
range
of
beer
drinkers
who
want
something
more
than
a
standard
lager
but
less
than
a
darker
spiced
going
to
get
a
case
to
keep
around
for
holiday
guests
a
very
nice
ipa
with
a
fruity
after
taste
this
does
taste
more
like
a
spring
beer
than
a
winter
ale
it
also
seems
like
a
session
ipa
i
can
see
my
self
drinking
3
or
4
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
purchased
this
in
delaware
since
this
is
not
availlable

my

im
glad
i
made
the
purchase

a

ok
nice

feel
ok
beer
but
for
me
more
of
that
new
style
ipl
than
ipa
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
pretty
nice
persistent
head
and
some
fair
lacing
nose
is
yeasty
with
some
savory
spice
yeast
and
citrus
with
something
of
a
paper
or
cardboard
characteristic
and
a
really
steely
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
o
nor
my
favorite
style
but
welldone
overall
i
would
really
like
more
citrus
hop
character
to
balance
out
the
dank
resiny
character
in
this
one
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
some
earthy
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
dirt
covered
berry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
the
mosiac
hops
adding
a
dirty
berry
like
quality
that
comes
through
more
in
the
taste
o
i
appreciate
the
attempt
to
make
an
ipa
a
winter
beer
but
this
one
missed
the
mark
about
at
my
wits
end
with
nb
on
the
overlapping
flavors
that
seem
to
carry
over
into
so
many
of
their
beers
overall
i
have
to
say
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
it
to
i
still
question
the
move
by
new
belgium
to
release
this
beer
as
a
winter
seasonal
it
seems
to
be
more
fitting
as
a
spring
time
or
very
early
summer
beer
one
of
the
more
solid
beers
from
new
belgium
i
still
wish
they
didnt
do
away
with
snow
day
idk
to
each
there
own
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
unless
on
somekindof
super
sale
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down

overall
new
belgium
typically
puts
out
decent
to
exceptional
brews
you
can
really
do
no
wrong
with
this
brewery
this
beer
is
certainly
not
overwhelming
but
it
tastes
good
and
i
do
not
regret
trying
it
this
ipa
will
not
kick
your
butt
with
hops
but
it
could
definitely
make
a
great
session
beer
this
a
winter
offering
from
new
belgium
i
normally
drink
thick
belgians
trappists
porters
and
stouts
in
colder
weather
rather
than
hoppy
beers
this
white
ipa
is
a
surprise
though
the
label
says
fruit
and
citrus
but
when
first
poured
the
nose
is
very
pine
and
spruce
and
the
flavor
backs
this
up
nicely
when
i
think
winter
i
think

this

seasonal
2

snow

were
some
of

and
to
replace
them
with
a

is

would
have

the

had
a
friend
get
a
twelve
pack
of
this
so
i
thought
i
would
try
one
this
beer
was
a
white
ipa
what
i
found
interesting
about
this
beer
was
it
was
almost
like
looking
out
my
window
on
a
snowy
night
and
seeing
snow
slowly
fall
which
ties
into
the
name
accumulation
the
color
was
a
straw
yellow
with
a
white
fog
it
was
pretty
hoppy
when
i
drank
it
hoppy
and
it
makes
up
for
the
fall
seasonal
beer
that
i
had
from
this
brewer
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
as
a
good
american

the

ive

floral

not
the
best

from

by

love
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
if
you
havent
had
it
seek
it
out
it
can
be
difficult
to
find
the
nose
is
brown
sugar
with
dark
fruit
hints
of
alcohol
and
vanilla
it
pours
hazy
amber
with
a
thick
rocky
head
alowly
descenting
to
icebergs
of
foam
that
produce
thick
lace
brown
chunks
suspended
in
the
beer
give
it
a
snow
globe
quality
or
perhaps
a
desert
sandstorm
the
beer
is
not
that
old
and
there
are
no
hints
of
oxidation
on
tha
palate
on
the
palate
the
fruit
starts
as
caramel
sweetened
peach
that
gradually
becomes
more
raisinlike
the
flavors
at
the
beginning
feature
the
alcohol
interacting
with
the
malt
and
the
yeast
while
by
the
finish
the
interactions
between
the
alcohol
and
the
hops
become
more
prominent
medium
body
and
carbonation
pours
an
amber
color
with
medium
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
as
you
drink
medium
malty
flavor
with
hints
of
caramel
in
the
finish
slightly
bitter

taste
pretty

beer
good

style

i
think
i
just
might
be
less
prone
to
like
high
abvs
because
the
strong
alcohol
taste
kind
of
ruined
it
a
little
for
me
hence
the
lower
rating
on
taste
value
still
overall
this
is
a
fairly
solid

this
drinks
nicely
but
needs
a
larger
level
of
hop
for
its
tripel
name
on
the
front
it
still
goes
down
well
regardless
this
isnt
an
awful
beer
but
it
needs
a
new
name
i
think
surprisingly
boozy
and
sweet
not
as
simcoe
forward
as
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
kuhnhenn
puts
out
some
great
beers
some
fantastic
beers
this
is
neither
this
is
barely
above
average
at
best
too
many
weird
aromas
and
flavors
that
just
didnt
play
well
together
and
definitely
didnt
agree
with
my
palate
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
o
amazing
ipa
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
interpretation
is
very
very
good
i
expect
the
freshness
of
having
this
from
a
new
growler
may
account
for
my
score
being
substantially
higher
than
the
average
if
you
have
the
means
to
try
it
on

dont
miss
it
orangey

with
a

one
of

some

with

atop
it
the
nose
contains
citrus

hops
yeast
a
very
pleasant
smell
to
it
sipping
on
this
high

and
i
taste
grapes
fruit
candy
hops
this
is
a
nice
tasting
beer
albeit
a
bit
boozy
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
bitter
and
sweet
finish
if
you
come
across
it
i
recommend
it
a
dark
cloudy
amber
tea
color
with
a
solid
white
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
nice
tea
clove
and
bananacitrus
hop
mild
but
very
nice
the
flavor
brings
a
sweet
banana
bubblegum
and
grassy
wheat
grain
with
a
lemony
touch
throughout
maybe
an
orange
idea
too
this
is
mediumplus
bodied
with
a
pretty
thick
feel
over
tiny
carbonation
that
brings
a
tingly
addition
the
citrus
banana
bread
is
different
its
a
belgian
ale
thats
sweet
and
unique
not
disappointing
though
im
not
sure
id
pay
another
18
a
half
growler
for
a
repeat
performance
but
arguably
worth
it
nice
o
based
on
the
name
i
was
expecting
more
bitterness
overall
a
decent
beer
but
too
thick
for
a
belgian
style
and
not
bitter
enough
for
an
ipa
o
this
beer
is
quite
interesting
for
the
style
due
to
the
flavors
of
bananas
from
the
yeast
it
seems
like
it
could
use
a
little
more
hop
flavors
and
associated
bitterness
o
another
really
good
beer
from
a
quality
american
brewer
doing
european
style
beers
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
with
a
really
interesting
flavor
combination
o
guess
i
expected
more
hops
but
this
is
quite
fruity
and
spicy
the
yeast
component
is
nice
and
this
is
probably
the
creamiest
pale
ale
ive
had
interesting
but
probably
not
something
i
would
go
back
to
dont
really
know
what
to
base
it
on
or
what
to
expect
from
the
style
pale
american
belgo
style
but
it
was
better
then
the
tangerine
wit
and
the
loco
yokel
that
my
gf
and
my
dad
tried
very
drinkable
overall
the
weird
off
flavor
took
over
this
beer
for
me
it
could
have
been
good
but
just
didnt
get
there
typical
average
american
made
bipa
heavy
on
the
tropical
fruit
hops
a
sweet
malt
to
go
along
with
a
tropical
fruit
hop
profile
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
cheers
overall
a
very

beer
lots
of
tropical
fruits
nice
hop
flavor
good
malty
backbone
with
kick
of
booze
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
despite
the
abv
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
thought
the
rdipa
was
better
wish
the
nose
was
a
bit
stronger
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
made
up
for
it
would
have
it
again
if
you
normally
prefer
the
more
citrusy
strong
ipas
i
would
recommend
switching
out
to
this
every
now
and
again
ive
had
a
number
of
michigan
simcoe
varieties
and
this
is
definitely
the
best
i
dont
think
this
should
be
sour
based
on
other
reviews
but
it
also
doesnt
look
like
a
beer
that
is
traditionally
aged
so
who
knows
maybe
it
was
a
different
beer
in
08
anyone
have
any
insight
bm
me
thanks
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
to
start
off
with
the
head
fades
away
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
was
a
little
hoppy
i
expected
it
to
be
a
little
stronger
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
also
a
little
lighter
than
expected
but
it
was
strong
in
the
aftertaste
the
simcoe
hops
really
shine
through
on
the
back
end
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
average
its
not
thick
or
watery
so
much
its
just
about
right
pretty
good
brew
taste
is
good
an
enjoyable
pale
but
doesnt
live
up
to
the
name
i
ordered
simcoe
silly
so
i
expect
a
slap
of
simcoe
disappointing
but
given
a
different
nonmisleading
name
i
would
have
really
dug
it
poured
a
moderate
orangecopper
color
with
a
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
at
all
and
really
didnt
provide
any
sort
of
lacing
the
nose
was
just
a
mess
with
some
yeast
going
atop
some
pine
and
floral
hops
and
the
floral
hops
taking
on
a
grassy
medicinal
astringency
the
taste
was
a
bit
worse
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
the
flavors
just
clashing
completely
alcohol
in
the
feel
this
just
did
not
drink
well
and
was
unfortunately
not
a
good
beer
id
like
to
think
i
just
got
this
at
the
wrong
time
and
would
be
up
for
trying
it
again
as
im
normally
a
fan
of
pretty
much
everything
that
kuhnhenn
does
it
drinks
okay
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
i
guess
but
the
alcohol
isnt
covered
up
all
that
well
because
of
the
wet
finish
im
not
finding
it
refreshing
and
i
am
not
eager
to
get
to
the
next
sip
so
far
my
least
favorite
kuhnhenn
beer
ive
tried
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
into
a
tulip
one
of
the
few
disappointments
on
an
otherwise
outstanding
night
pours
a
very
dark
orange
almost
brown
tope
head
good
lacing
and
retention
aroma
is
light
hops
notes
of
cloves
banana
and
bubblegum
super
sweet
here
not
in
a
good
way
at
all
the
taste
is
also
way
to
sweet
banana
and
bubblegum
a
total
lack
of
hops
wheat
finish
the
feel
is
ok
not
easy
to
drink
just
way
to
sweet
this
is
not
a
pale
ale
this
beer
is
really
not
good
needs
to
be
much
more
balanced
with
hops
if
you
want
bubblegum

i
have
had
this
many
different
times
over
the
years
so
it
was
nice
to
revisit
this
beer
hazy
orange
pour
with
a
fizzy
off
white
head
and
drippy
lace
aroma
is
dusty
with
subtle
hints
of
tropical
fruit
and
pine
hops
were
rather
subdued
in
comparison
with
my
previous
samples
of
this
beer
drinks
like
a
saison
with
a
modest
hop
bite
spicy
dry
finish
i
think
i
liked
this
out
of
all
proportion
it
seemed
fairly
simple
but
at
the
same
time
insanely
drinkable
really
good
stuff
thanks
to
andrew
for
bringing
this
growler
back
from
michigan
d
very
nice
id
like
another
and
would
buy
again
id
maybe
get
a
pack
of
these
for
a
party
on
tap
at
the
kuhnhenn
brew
pub
poured
a
clear
dark
golden
orange
with
little
head
had
a
sweet
orange
fruit
taste
with
a
hop
bite
up
front
and
finished
with
a
yeasty
spice
kind
of
after
taste
almost
like
a
belgian
well
i
guess
they
have
it
classifed
as
belgian
on
here
and
the
brew
put
had
it
listed
as
a
golden
ale
it
was
a
interesting
offering
thats
for
sure
the
8
5
alc
wasnt
noticable
at
all
decent
beer
overall
chewy
mull
body
with
a
lot
of
fresh
floral
hop
bitterness
as
well
as
some
nice
sweet
citrus
character
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
last
but
become
less
prominent
as
they
are
countered
by
the
graham
cracker
and
biscuit
malts
as
well
as
a
very
prominent
bready
yeast
character
hits
of
light
crisp
fruit
and
ripe
banana
add
to
the
complexity
but
the
hops
are
the
star
here
as
mentioned
above
they
are
very
floral
and
sweet
up
front
with
a
slight
bitterness
that
lasts
throughout
into
a
delicious
dry
finish
the
abv
is
excellently
masked
making
it
dangerously
drinkable
usually
i
dont
like
hoppy
beers
to
have
this
much
of
a
malt
backbone
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
my
favorite
from
kuhnhenn
well
i
was
told
this
was
a
strong
ipa
so
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
but
to
see
here
that
it
was
a
strong
belgian
pale
ale
then
it
seems
much
more
spot
on
it
poured
a
pretty
clear
dark
coppery
and
smelled
of
light
fruits
and
hops
the
taste
was
pretty
sweet
and
hoppy
but
finished
slightly
bland
its
mouthfeel
was
pretty
decent
and
decently
drinkablebut
not
enjoyable
enough
for
me
to
want
to
this
is
another
interesting
big
beer
from
kuhnhenn
and
the
aroma
didnt
prepare
me
for
the
onslaught
that
i
was
going
to
get
in
the
taste
tons
of
different
flavors
from
sweetness
to
floral
to
almost
purfumy
im
not
convinced
it
comes
together
perfectly
but
im
enjoying
sipping
on
it
overall
this
beer
just
does
not
work
nothing
seems
to
fit
together
at
all
too
much
alcohol
too
musky
and
too
much
going
on
at
once
in
a
bad
way
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
in
which
i
would
reevaluate
other
i
really
dont
plan
on
drinking
this
one
again
acquired
this
in
a
trade
thanks
to
cosco
pours
honey
in
color
with
white
head
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
of
this
beer
i
just
assumed
from
the
name
that
it
would
be
an
ipa
but
thats
not
the
case
honestly
i
dont
know
whether
this
is
supposed
to
be
any
specific
style
regardless
on
the
nose
im
getting
hops
simcoe
i
assume
sweet
malt
and
a
tad
of
honey
same
with
the
taste
which
is
quite
sweet
and
floral
but
there
are
also
some
clove
and
spice
qualities
characteristic
of
a
belgian
brew
so
perhaps
this
is
a
hybrid
body
is
a
tad
on
the
thick
syrupy
side
for
my
taste
and
drinkability
suffers
for
it
an
interesting
beer
but
it
doesnt
come
across
as
tightly
focused
a
bit
of
multiple
personality
disorder
here
with
too
much
going
on
for
my
taste
d
i
dont
think
i
will
make
it
through
this
one
beer
an
interesting
beer
it
definitely
works
for
the
most
part
though
it
can
be
a
touch
cloying
at
times
though
not
really
if
you
take
the
10
alcohol
into
account
this
is
a
nice
beer
one
that
certainly
combines
the
simcoe
hops
and
the
belgian
yeast
pretty
well
but
somehow
it
seems
like
it
could
have
been
much
more
interesting
i
am
not
exactly
sure
why
though
perhaps
it
is
a
touch
too
sweet
and
it
doesnt
quite
seem
complex
enough
somehow
i
really
wanted
to
try
an
offering
from
kuhnhenn
on
tap
and
i
was
totally
and
completely
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
d
i
dont
view
this
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
rather
a
weizenipa
mix
a
german
ipa
perhaps
whatever
it
is
i
like
it
and
could
tolerate
another
glass
or
two
served
in
a
tulip
low

good

juicier
than
i
remember
it
being
on
tap
but
esters
still
dominating
big
and
bold
and
still
doesnt
pull
it
together
for
me
thanks
to
bartle
overall
not
bad
not
my
favorite
from
them
but
not
bad
at
all
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
fresh
on
tap
as
i
am
sure
it
was
intensely
good
hv
on
tap
at
the
brewery
poured
a
cloudy
pale
orange
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
smell
and
taste
were
a
combination
of
bubblegum
pepper
coriander
cloves
and
banana
smooth
drinkable
and
not
overly
strong
but
the
flavor
faded
fairly
quickly
in
my
opinion
while
i
was
drinking
this
i
swore
it
was
a
tripel
but
i
guess
the
difference
in
the
styles
is
still
blurry
to
me
bottle
poured
a
medium
copper

a
medium

foamy

with
good

and
good
lacing
aroma
of
simcoe
hops
with
semisweet
belgian
malt
backbone
is
quite
interesting
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
quite
sweet
belgain
ale
with
some
green
simcoe
hops
clearly
noticeable
full
body
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
done
and
a
lot
more
complex
then
just
a
belgian
hop
bomb
notes
from

drinkablity
remarkably
smooth
and
dangerous
on
just
a
sip
i
would
never
guess
that
this
is
8
5
bottled
on
4409
not
my
favorite
of
kuhnhenns
brews
by
any
means
but
not
bad
compared
to
others
out
there
this
should
probably
be
listed
under
a
belgian
ipa
judging
by
its
taste
definitely
one
of
the
more
hoppy
belgianstyle
beers
i
have
tasted
in
quite
some
time
might
drink
again
worth
trying
done
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
style
i
have
had
wonderful
fruity
flavour
with
a
sharp
citrus
smack
good
job
kuhnhenn
big
ups
to
my
man
erik
for
the
hookup
on
the
long
distance
growler
very
smooth
complex
and
rich
full
bodied
yet
easy
to
handle
an
awesome
offering
and
one
of
my
favorite
taps
at
kuhnhenn
the
alcohol
is
not
perceived
at
all
but
its
drinkability
suffers
a
tad
just
from
how
overhwelming
in
size
the
taste
is
is
if
you
get
a
chance
you
should
definitely
try
it
but
one
is
already
a
huge
amount
to
make
sense
of
while
simcoe
silly
gets
my
nod
for
the
oddest
beer
to
cross
my
gullet
lately
it
earns
little
else
its
just
too
much
the
flavors
dont
mesh
all
that
well
you
know
that
crazy
uncle
of
yours
who
has
no
social
graces
and
tries
to
compensate
by
telling
dirty
jokes
loudly
at
family
gatherings
yeah
thats
this
beer
thanks
to
kkulacki
for
getting
my
growler
filled
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
solid
small
head
that
builds
our
of
a
very
pretty
reverse
cascade
of
bubbles
odor
is
lemony
grassy
also
bubblegum
and
bananas
smells
fresh
and
delicious
this
is
one
of
those
stylespanning
beers
that
you
cant
really
place
with
anything
else
and
dont
really
want
to
hop
bitterness
and
phenolic
malt
up
front
with
lemony
simcoe
hops
growing
along
with
a
peppery
banana
alcohol
evident
but
not
overbearing
heavy
but
still
crisp
very
very
drinkable
kuhnhenn
can
do
no
wrong
d
very
impressive
i
am
absolutely
blown
away
kind
of
makes
me
think
of
an
american
dipa
made
with
belgian
yeast
my
roommate
said
it
tasted
like
an
alcoholic
orange
cream
sickle
get
some
really
drinkable
belgian
strong
pale
ale
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
have
been
enjoying
this
growler
all
weekend
and
will
be
sad
to
see
it
go
d
im
enjoying
this
after
a
15hour
workday
and
im
glad
i
chose
this
one
well
carbonated
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
it
doesnt
fell
hot
the
bottom
line
kuhnhenn
justifiably
have
a
reputation
for
unique
wellcrafted
beers
and
simcoe
silly
is
another
example
of
that
very
complex
taste
profile
and
certainly
worth
trying
out
if
you
run
into
it
pours
a
murky
dark
sunset
orange
with
a
fluffy
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
good
lacing
left
behind
once
the
head
descends
smell
isnt
as
hoppy
as
i
was
hoping
seeing
it
has
simcoe
in
the
title
big
yeasty
aroma
with
sweet
candy
and
banana
very
slight
hops
with
an
earthy
pepper
scent
as
well
the
hops
definitely
shine
up
front
in
the
flavor
department
lots
of
citrus
clementine
pineapple
peaches
and
grapefruit
the
sweet
hops
are
quickly
taken
over
by
the
bready
yeast
which
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
once
again
i
could
use
more
hops
in
the
taste
department
but
i
shouldnt
complain
seeing
its
a
belgian
ale
body
is
medium
with
a
smooth
feel
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
for
8
5
kuhnhenn
lives
up
to
the
hype
once
again
these
guys
really
know
what
theyre
doing
keep
up
the
good
work
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
easy
to
drink
for
sure
try
it
if
you
can
overall
this
beer
and
weyerbacher
double
simcoe
are
the
yen
and
yang
of
simcoe
beers
the
double
simcoe
is
big
bold
and
assualting
to
your
senses
this
beer
does
the
same
thing
in
such
an
opposite
way
the
sweet
bubblegum
and
fresh
fruit
flavors
of
this
beer
are
so
unique
the
double
simcoe
shows
off
how
simcoe
can
be
used
in
a
big
bold
hoppy
beer
and
kuhnhenn
has
shown
with
this
one
how
you
can
craft
a
perfect
belgian
brew
using
simcoe
i
love
it
it
was
a
real
joy
to
try
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
addition
of
the
simcoe
hops
really
added
a
nice
countertouch
to
the
yeast
spice
and
sweetness
of
a
regular
belgian
pale
ale
its
not
hugely
drinkable
by
any
means
but
it
hides
its
abv
very
well
and
is
generally
a
fine
steady
sipper
drinkability
good
stuff
id
offer
you
some
but
know
what
dont
bother
cuz
i
already
drank
it
all
d
this
was
just
a
little
too
different
for
me
i
enjoyed
trying
it
but
it
was
a
tad
hard
to
finish
note
the
generous
provider
of
this
beverage
mentioned
that
there
were
french
sea
salts
added
which
might
account
for
some
of
the
minerals
o
good
beer
very
interesting
glad
i
got
to
try
it
the
cloves
that
came
out
limited
the
drinkability
for
me
interesting
beer
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
like
to
try
to
push
things
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
them
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
different
and
unique
for
sure
but
also
high
quality
when
i
sample
something
legit
i
know
it
and
this
effort
speaks
highly
of
this
brewery
i
can
only
dream
of
living
close
enough
to
this
to
try
more

i
also
remember

bspa
ummm
okay
dont
expect
such
a
thing
when
its
your
time
to
drink

i

i

closer
to
warren
mithese
guys
are
impressing
the
hell
out
of
me
d
good
very
refreshing
all
around
very
strong
as
well
the
hop
freshness
in
this
beer
was
low
i
am
very
interested
in
trying
this
one
a
bit
younger
it
is
named
after
a
hop
afterall
no
another
unique
kuhnhenn
i
got
a
bunch
of
kuhnhenn
bottles
while
on
the
east
side
of
the
state
and
they
all
seem
to
have
a
bottling
problem
i
would
love
to
try
the
taproom
because
these
bottles
arent
quite
living
up
to
the
name
d
fine
for
this
one
not
something
ill
run
right
out
and
buy
more
of
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
kuhnhenn
brewery
poured
into
a
chalice
the
appearance
was
murky
orange
kind
of
hazy
smelled
citrucy
and
sweet
i
was
surprised
by
the
hops
in
the
flavor
because
belgian
pale
ales
usually
arent
too
hoppy
but
it
was
pretty
good
a
little
strong
in
alcohol
flavor
maybe
but
not
too
bad
sampled
on
draught
kuhnhenn
brewing
company
in
warren
michigan
light
yellow
color
moderately
aromatic
with
herbal
fruity
hop
aromas
and
a
ligtt
hint
of
passion
fruit
and
coriander
heavily
fruity
loaded
with
passion
fruit
tangerine
orange
coriander
peach
and
curacao
well
hidden
alcohol
with
an
herbal
base
seemed
like
the
spices
malt
and
yeast
contributed
more
in
my
sample
as
the
pinelike
simcoe
flavor
was
pretty
light
very
unique
belgianamerican
hybrid
hazy
amber
color
fluffy
white
head
complex
belgian
yeast
profile
dry
estery
and
slighty
woody
contrasted
is
a
heaping
amount
of
simcoe
hops
in
essence
these
are
seemingly
two
contrasting
flavors
but
this
works
not
highly
drinkable
however
abv
was
10
on
tap
at
the
brewery
at
the
brewery
on

poured
a
amber

with
a
small

aroma

and

flavor
alcohol
bubble
gum
hops
hints
of
orange
like
the
alcohol
bite
on
the
tongue
as
it
warmed
another
good
one
from
the
brothers
mouthfeel
again
sits
heavy
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
and
sweet
with
complimentery
sweetness
flavor
is
all
about
the
citrus
and
the
alcohol
is
not
as
up
and
front
as
i
was
expecting
hops
are
nice
and
lemony
tart
briefly
preceded
and
followed
by
a
quick
sweet
maltiness
very
balanced
and
pleasureable
slight
belgian
spiceniess
too
this
would
be
a
nice
dessert
beer
the
alcohol
ha
only
a
slight
presence
and
really
blends
in
well
with
the
lemony
citrus
surprisingly
light
body
and
refreshing
way
too
easy
to
drink
because
this
beer
will
knock
you
over
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
it
represents
an
oldworld
and
newworld
fusion
that
works
while
others
may
not
appreicate
these
crazy
american
hops
monkeying
with
their
belgian
ale
i
dont
think
they
are
illplaced
overstated
or
spoiling
to
the
enjoyability
of
this
beer
is
it
true
to
style
not
exactly
does
it
work
absofuckinlutely
orange
colour
with
a
thin
cream
coloured
head
that
formed
very
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
belgian
spiciness
with
lots
of
cloves
coriander
banana
and
apple
fruitiness
with
citrusy
and
slightly
piney
american
hops
the
flavour
was
more
of
the
same
with
a
juicy
citrus
character
and
great
balance
good
attenuation
with
little
residual
sugarstickiness
and
well
integrated
carbonation
smooth
for
the
high
abv
this
is
a
frighteningly
drinkable
beer
the
flavour
combination
might
not
work
for
some
but
i
found
it
to
be
interesting
definitely
something
that
ill
look
for
again
too
bad
they
didnt
have
any
bottled
when
i
tried
it
at
the
brewery
one
of
only
a
few
kuhnhenn
brews
i
have
had
a
chance
to
trypoured
a
deep
copper
with
a
deep
orange
tintaromas
really
stood
out
for
me
with
this
beer
fruity
apricot
and
very
ripe
pineapple
with
a
light
spice
note
very
fruity
and
big
tasting
orangey
and
spicey
some
cloves
mainly
with
a
noticable
hebal
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
this
was
quite
big
not
sure
if
i
could
much
but
it
was
flavorful
and
quite
tastey
amber
color
with
just
a
slight
haze
and
a
slight
head
although
that
is
probably
due
more
to
the
glass
i
was
drinking
from
the
aroma
has
a
nice
grapefruit
rind
and
orange
character
i
do
get
a
little
banana
but
not
the
bubble
gum
the
label
not
mentions
the
taste
is
hop
forward
with
more
of
the
grapefruit
rind
the
bubblegum
does
come
across
here
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
on
the
finish
delicate
but
full
mouth
feel
nicely
drinkable
really
for
any
season
especially
this
warm
fall
day
nice
beer
hard
to
pick
a
style
for
it
apa
hmm
though
its
interesting
and
worth
the
try
its
not
overly
drinkable
i
do
like
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
and
flavors
that
make
you
think
but
one
was
enough
interesting
use
of
hops
for
the
style
but
i
dont
think
it
works
another
nice
offering
from
the
guys
at
kuhnhenn
poured
out
to
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
stayed
steady
rather
cloudy
but
no
sediment
was
found
nice
lace
around
the
glass
too
odors
of
bananas
malt
and
almost
clover
were
noted
flavor
was
a
little
to
alcohol
for
my
taste
but
true
to
form
for
the
style
smooth
slightly
creamy
yeast
and
malt
flavors
with
a
light
syruplike
quality
finished
smooth
with
a
bubblegum
like
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
but
could
use
some
improvements
here
and
there
still
a
solid
beer
but
i
really
feel
that
the
prevalence
of
alcohol
was
too
strong
and
took
away
from
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
beer
still
i
must
recommend
this
beer
for
fans
of
the
style
overall
i
would
say
that
one
or
two
of
these
a
night
would
suffice
it
is
a
very
good
and
tasty
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
in
moderation
as
far
as
belgian
strone
pales
go
this
is
not
near
the
top
of
the
list
but
otherwise
enjoyable
ok
i
gotta
be
honest
i
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
especially
the
aroma
it
smells
like
a
sack
full
of
buttholes
i
tried
drinking
it
but
the
rank
smell
scared
the
hell
out
of
me
if
you
hold
your
nose
its
actally
not
a
bad
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
the
taste
isnt
bad
the
only
problem
is
it
stinks
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
fact
i
need
to
hold
my
nose
to
drink
it
that
gets
old
quick
i
just
got
a
cast
removed
from
my
broken
hand
the
beer
smells
alot
like
that
nasty
old
cast
the
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
style
but
it
leaves
a
rough
tingle
on
my
tounge
thats
a
bit
awkward
between
the
8
5abv
and
odd
nose
i
would
switch
to
something
else
in
this
style
at
the
same
time
this
could
be
a
great
beer
as
it
tastes
really
good
but
other
aspects
could
use
some
help
clear
light
copper
body
topped
by
a
halfinch
of
off
white
foam
sparkling
amber
highlights
accent
the
body
the
aroma
is
sweet
pine
and
florals
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
very
sweet
up
front
with
nice
bitterness
in
the
mid
and
a
lingering
bubble
gum
finish
hints
of
alcohol
become
a
bit
more
pronounced
as
you
proceed
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
but
falls
short
of
syrupy
excellent
drinkability
really
a
superb
beer
the
use
of
some
type
of
belgian
yeast
gives
this
beer
its
unique
character
very
creative
superb
color
a
cloudy
ghosty
orangey
brown
topped
by
a
foamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
piney
containing
a
strong
hop
impart
highly
yeasty
yet
intensely
caramelic
woody
and
orangey
ive
never
smelled
anything
like
this
a
great
original
blend
of
less
original
flavours
that
work
in
unison
wow
thats
good
more
earthy
orange
flesh
paired
along
with
piney
and
foresty
floral
and
herbal
butterscotch
flavours
rather
complex
but
most
of
all
hypnotizing
working
well
together
factor
moderately
carbonated
perhaps
a
bit
thinnedout
mouthfeel
but
still
working
well
now
clark
who
was
kind
enough
to
share
this
growler
insists
that
it
is
far
more
exciting
filling
and
better
bodied
fresh
on
tap
and
while
i
believe
him
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
beer
a
whole
lot
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
finished
quite
clean
and
refreshing
after
an
initial
sticky
sweetness
wont
rate
this
very
high
on
the
drinkable
scale
due
to
the
seriously
heavy
perfume
flavor
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
12
eggshell
head
over
the
bright
copper
brew
head
isnt
as
resilient
as
most
belgianstyles
but
could
be
the
alcohol
coming
into
play
and
lacing
is
average
aroma
is
sweet
yet
citrusy
not
unexpected
from
the
name
and
it
meets
the
advertising
taste
is
tart
citrus
upfront
which
changes
gears
to
slightly
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
interesting
and
drinkability
is
excellent
for
the
style
and
strength
try
it
if
you
can
pours
a
peachlike
color
with
a
creamy
whitehead
that
leave
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
belgiany
and
candylike
fruity
and
sweet
it
is
alcoholic
and
liquorlike
in
aroma
too
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
sugary
candylike
it
has
a
fruity
yeasty
character
too
it
has
some
strength
too
it
but
it
is
well
hidden
an
different
beer
very
interesting
and
tasty
thanks
to
stubob
for
sharing
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
looks
like
a
standard
pale
ale
in
the
glass
though
its
marketed
as
a
belgian
this
is
a
strange
brew
a
marriage
of
a
belgian
brew
with
a
overdose
of
west
coase
simcoe
hops
remarkable
imagine
la
chouffe
meeting
90
minute
pale
ale
and
you
get
the
idea
many
thanks
to
trbeer
for
making
me
the
first
beer
recipient
in
bif
xv
and
for
sending
me
this
gem
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
once
again
thanks
to
brett
and
eric
for
their
worldclass
hospitality
in
giving
us
these
rare
beers
to
sample
well
definitely
brings
together
just
what
i
like
belgians
and
hops
and
shows
they
arent
mutually
exclusive
in
any
way
esters
meld
nicely
with
the
simcoe
hops
to
present
a
very
unique
beer
and
one
i
enjoyed
more
than
say
orval
definitely
another
one
of
the
ones
ill
hope
to
try
again
drinkability
is
ok
hop
choice
seems
just
too
powerful
for
style
and
overpowers
mre
subtle
notes
get
some
almost
a
kind
of
crossover
between
a
more
standard
englishstyle
pale
ale
and
something
belgian
obviously
they
seem
to
be
going
for
the
latter
but
something
about
this
dulls
it
out
not
bad
and
kind
of
interesting
674
o
4
overall
a
solid
beer
ive
never
loved
any
of
the
peace
tree
beers
but
theyre
all
good
this
is
no
different
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
at
first
nose
herbal
fruit
with
light
graham
cracker
pours
amber
with
a
slight
haze
under
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
but
leaves
tons
of
lace
palate
starts
hinting
of
fruit
then
blossoms
into
melon
flavors
that
dissolve
into
a
big
drying
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
herbal
astringency
a
light
graham
cracker
slightly
sweetened
with
caramel
lies
under
the
fruit
flavors
medium
body
and
slightly
below
medium
carbonation
well
put
o
the
strong
aromatics
call
out
belgian
yeast
but
the
decidedly
american
hop
profile
overcomes
and
makes
the
flavor
its
own
both
aspects
working
together
with
some
harmony
its
in
the
feel
that
this
beer
falls
somewhat
flat
literally
its
hard
to
peg
but
even
though
this
beer
is
carbonated
it
doesnt
feel
like
it
so
even
though
the
direction
in
which
hop
wrangler
is
headed
is
a
fantastic
one
its
not
quite
ready
to
ride
off
into
the
sunset
just
yet
overall
i
will
most
definitely
pick
this
beer
up
again
when
heading
through
iowa
the
other
beer
of
theirs
i
had
was
infected
and
i
was
bummed
but
this
is
fresh
and
delicious
very
solid
offering
in
the
end
the
bitterness
is
too
emphasized
not
very
pleasing
and
too
much
o
my
overall
experience
was
fair
but
could
be
better
i
will
give
it
another
try
due
to
the
fact
of
the
bottle
being
damaged
overall
good
more
balanced
than
most
love
the
stubby
bottle
t
o
one
of
those
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
type
beers
a
tasty
take
on
a
style
i
like
one
id
probably
drink
often
if
i
lived
in
iowa
alas
i
dont
tried
it
once
on
tap
there
its
every
bit
as
good
from
the
bottle
while
perhaps
not
spot
on
compared
to
a
belgian
brewed
ipa
peace
tree
does
a
great
job
with
this
and
the
generous
flavor
character
is
very
desirable
im
really
enjoying
my
first
peace
tree
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
ipa
often
if
i
had
access
to
it
but
id
enjoy
it
from
time
to
time
then
again
as
it
continues
to
warm
that
belgian
yeast
finish
is
growing
on
me
and
reminding
of
the
enjoyable
devils
backbone
belgian
congo
pale
cloudy
copper
very
carbonated
producing
large
heads
with
every
bottle
smell
is
sweet
and
caramely
with
familiar
tones
of
belgianstyle
yeast
flavor
is
drier
than
you
would
expect
from
a
belgian
styled
ipa
has
a
metallic
twang
and
a
sizable
hop
bitterness
versus
the
style
it
is
what
i
would
expect
a
belgian
ipa
to
be
the
beer
feel
think
but
the
champagnelike
carbonation
really
cuts
the
underlying
viscosity
definitely
worth
checking
out
maybe
the
best
beer
from
iowa
i
have
had
to
this
point
you
could
definitely
use
this
as
a
hot
summers
day
beer
or
a
good
introduction
to
ipas
as
it
isnt
as
abrasive
as
west
coast
styles
or
as
heavy
as
englishbelgians
that
said
this
belgian
is
drinkable
and
almost
pleasant
if
only
the
label
on
this
one
even
hinted
at
the
crosscultural
nature
of
this
one
beyond
the
paragraph
on
the
back
its
a
belgian
for
hopheads
or
an
ipa
for
belgian
lovers
but
its
a
long
way
from
a
straightforward
ipa
served
on
tap
at
el
bait
shop
pours
an
orangish
color
with
a
half
finger
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
little
fruity
from
the
belgian
yeast
with
some
grapefruit
hops
palate
is
similar
starts
off
with
some
cereal
and
caramel
malta
that
transition
to
some
fruitiness
ends
with
a
very
pungent
onion
pretty
solid
belgian
ipa
i
think
hop
sutra
is
better
but
this
is
delicious
in
its
own
way
o
a
decent
belgian
ipa
dont
know
how
fresh
but
the
hops
definitely
take
a
back
seat
to
the
belgian
side
of
it
an
interesting
mix
of
belgian
english
and
american
ingredients
combine
to
make
for
a
unique
style
defying
ipa
mostyly
bitter
resiny
palate
with
a
little
tartness
taste
more
like
an
american
ipa
than
a
belgian
ipa
to
me
still
not
a
bad
beer
and
im
happy
i
got
to
try
it
o
average
ipa
would
most
likely
pass
this
up
if
it
was
alocal
on
the
shelves
unless
priced
very
reasonably
overall
the
hop
mix
in
this
beer
is
very
good
smells
and
taste
great
the
feel
is
a
little
off
and
im
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
belgian
ipa
when
i
drink
it
i
think
many
could
easily
agree
it
is
an
american
ipa
it
is
still
a
very
good
ipa
nonetheless
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
i
was
glad
to
try
this
one
but
also
not
one
i
would
seek
out
o
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
last
summer
and
hard
to
imagine
i
havent
had
it
since
then
plenty
tasty
and
a
good
choice
for
when
you
want
a
nice
dry
ipa
o
im
not
a
fan
of
begian
ipas
however
this
one
was
tasty
and
easy
drinking
it
wasnt
until
writing
the
review
i
found
out
this
a
belgian
ipa
i
was
at
the
bar
thinking
it
had
just
standard
flavor
and
less
intensity
than
others
but
for
a
bipa
its
nice
it
does
have
the
added
fruitiness
some
lemon
and
maybe
a
bit
or
orange
it
has
a
bit
of
a
kick
but
levels
out
towards
the
end
it
looks
and
smells
pretty
and
has
s
nice
body
to
it
the
aroma
is
light
citrus
aromas
lemon
with
hints
of
banana
light
clove
and
grassy
notes
and
a
touch
of
light
bready
malts
well
rounded
i
have
to
say
as
i
take
the
first
sip
crisp
clean
with
a
nice
touch
of
lemon
zest
that
cracks
the
lips
smooth
yeast
notes
and
light
banana
then
grace
the
palate
and
leave
a
light
fruit
flavor
that
mingles
well
with
the
grainy
malts
on
the
way
out
light
dry
clean
and
smooth
finish
o
i
am
very
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
i
do
feel
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
takes
on
an
ipa
with
a
belgian
twist
not
that
i
have
had
a
ton
yet
though
but
i
just
cant
find
myself
to
enjoy
these
more
than
a
straight
west
coast
ipa
well
balanced
and
drinkable
definitely
doesnt
feel
like
a
6
25
beer
though
it
lacks
some
aspects
i
enjoy
in
my
ipas
it
makes
up
for
it
with
its
execution
in
other
areas
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
could
try
it
thanks
again
matt
overall
a
more
than
solid
belgian
ipa
which
has
some
nice
english
ipa
components
in
addition
to
the
expected
american
hops
the
beer
may
be
a
little
too
yeasty
as
i
learned
you
really
do
need
to
leave
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
which
is
almost
the
last
2
ounces
or
it
takes
over
a
little
amateur
and
homebrewish
but
very
tasty
nonetheless
moderately
bitter
with
pine
dried
orange
peel
and
herbal
hop
flavors
dry
moderately
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
resiny
feel
that
sticks
to
the
teeth
medium
to
full
bodied
with
the
extra
yeast
ironically
the
brewer
recommends
decanting
off
the
yeast
ill
review
the
bottle
sample
soon
for
a
better
comparison
drinkability
again
the
yeast
triggers
bad
memories
of
their
saison
but
this
is
a
decent
ipa
i
would
prefer
it
not
be
belgianstyle
but
that
is
not
peace
trees
thing
okay
i
went
back
to
the
bottle
and
sniffed
the
sediment
which
the
bottle
specifically
said
not
to
pour
and
all
the
sharp
bready
aromas
from
the
belgian
yeast
was
there
i
wonder
how
pouring
the
whole
thing
residual
sediment
and
all
into
the
glass
might
have
changed
the
aroma
and
taste
now
i
really
do
wish
this
were
more
readily
available
good
complex
stuff
m
perfectly
viscous
for
an
ipa
ive
definitely
had
more
than
a
few
that
feel
like
im
drinking
hopessence
water
good
carbonation
that
tickles
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
on
the
lips
pretty
solid
ipa
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
come
out
of
iowa
great
work
to
the
people
at
peace
tree
this
is
my
first
six
pack
of
your
beer
and
i
will
buy
some
more
later
a
nice
beer
that
falls
somewhere
between
an
english
ipa
and
a
belgian
ipa
not
as
hop
forward
as
i
was
expecting
the
beer
does
drink
pretty
well
glad
to
have
had
this
one
a
high
hop
beer
that
worked
well
with
the
belgian
malt
and
yeast
d
i
really
liked
this
one
all
three
peace
tree
beers
that
ive
tried
have
been
very
good
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
and
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
boozy
and
a
bit
medicinal
with
notes
of
spice
and
clove
as
well
as
a
floral
hop
bouquet
the
flavor
is
lighter
that
the
aroma
suggested
there
really
isnt
a
ton
here
other
than
some
medicinal
hop
notes
and
light
grassiness
the
body
is
light
overall
this
one
was
drinkable
but
completely
unmemorable
quite
nice
this
style
is
hit
or
miss
but
peace
tree
has
done
it
well
good
to
know
that
good
beers
an
get
brewed
in
marion
county
iowa
get
rid
of
the
firephenol
thing
and
this
would
be
a
solid
beer
d
easy
drinking
i
would
actually
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
very
nice
iowa
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
good
head
retention
and
plenty
of
lace
the
aroma
is
a
great
fruity
oarnge
and
fresh
hop
with
some
of
that
fruity
british
maltiness
the
flavor
is
awesome
with
lots
of
fruity
hops
some
pineapple
some
orange
and
a
mild
bit
of
grapefruit
there
is
a
nice
herbal
character
as
well
with
a
bright
maltines
shining
throguh
while
maintaining
a
fairly
dry
character
really
tasty
stuff
all
the
parts
are
good
and
this
a
nice
and
fairly
interesting
beer
but
it
doesnt
cohere
into
anything
special
its
just
the
sum
of
its
parts
thats
it
d
decent
little
ipa
from
a
little
iowa
brewery
maybe
not
quite
the
right
balance
just
yet
between
the
american
hops
english
malts
and
belgian
yeast
but
i
love
the
concept
and
the
beer
definitely
has
its
moments
so
although
not
spectacular
its
worth
a
few
pints
the
flavor
amps
up
the
spiciness
as
the
belgian
yeast
adds
cracked
white
pepper
and
to
combine
with
zesty
minty
herbal
hop
notes
drying
malt
suggests
toffee
and
woody
tannins
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
wellcarbonated
with
a
medium
consistency
and
lingering
hop
kick
all
in
all
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
peace
tree
didnt
really
impress
me
with
their
rye
porter
but
hop
wrangler
is
superb
give
it
a
try
notes
really
a
good
beer
especially
for
a
new
brewery
very
good
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
with
distinct
flavors
from
all
three
countries
coming
out
well
definitely
would
recommend
this
so
peace
tree
hop
wrangler
3
is
a
solid
effort
that
doesnt
come
close
to
challenging
the
greats
of
the
style
it
is
encouraging
though
that
an
iowa
brewery
can
brew
a
belgian
ipa
that
has
many
more
positives
than
negatives
pours
a
rich
deep
dark
mahogany
amber
fairly
clear
body
with
a
large
dense
khaki
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
film
with
some
bubbles
and
large
amounts
of
dry
sticky
web
like
lacing
aroma
is
odd
citric
and
caramel
dominant
with
a
musty
and
smoky
as
in
ash
tray
like
undertone
body
is
medium
thick
chewy
and
pleasantly
sharply
carbonated
with
a
clean
dry
earthy
finish
flavor
packs
a
massive
caramel
malty
body
with
a
potent
bitter
hoppy
and
mildly
orange
and
grapefruit
citric
finish
unexpectedly
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
still
not
a
top
tier
ipa
but
for
my
tastes
the
balance
of
strong
caramel
malt
and
citric
sweetness
with
aggressive
bitter
hoppiness
was
very
enjoyable
future
outlook
a
friend
scooped
this
up
for
me
in
iowa
recently
if
only
i
knew
then
what
i
know
now
i
wouldve
had
him
scoop
me
up
some
more
has
me
anxious
to
try
my
rye
porter
from
peace
tree
the
flavor
is
much
less
unique
from
the
tap
a
little
wishy
washy
in
the
flavor
profile
with
the
citric
notes
overtaking
the
belgian
notes
yeasts
add
a
hint
of
pepper
with
a
bitter
finish
body
remains
a
little
low
while
the
carbonation
doesnt
kick
quite
as
hard
my
opinion
get
a
sixpack
and
avoid
the
draft
the
beer
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
orange
hops
with
some
bready
malt
notes
the
flavor
is
orange
hops
with
some
pine
and
grass
mixed
in
as
well
low
to
medium
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
poured
from
a
12oz
stubby
bottle
no
bottle
date
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
pours
a
nice
brownishcopper
color
with
some
head
retention
and
medium
carbonation
smells
of
some
nice
citrusygrapefruit
hops
sweet
candi
sugar
with
some
phenolestery
aromas
gives
a
good
hop
bite
that
surprised
me
lots
of
hop
flavor
with
some
malt
sweetness
that
finishes
with
some
alcohol
warmth
flows
through
the
palate
pretty
good
with
lots
of
perceived
hop
bitterness
a
little
more
caramel
malts
for
balance
and
this
would
be
a
very
good
drinker
d
unlike
a
few
ipas
ive
had
i
could
definitely
throw
down
a
few
the
refreshing
feel
makes
you
want
to
pick
up
the
glass
as
soon
as
you
swallow
im
lucky
to
have
this
beer
locally
and
at
a
nice
price
overall
a
job
very
well
done
from
this
new
brewery
i
look
forward
to
more
of
their
brews
it
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
but
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
well
done
beer
from
my
wifes
hometown
ive
been
frequenting
their
brewery
and
im
pretty
impressed
with
their
efforts
im
hoping
that
their
full
flavored
beers
catch
on
in
the
land
of
bmc
rich
deep
golden
colored
with
an
inch
thick
head
of
tightly
packed
off
white
head
brussels
lacing
the
nose
is
fairly
subdued
but
i
get
a
bit
of
the
acidic
belgian
yeast
with
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
intensely
bitter
citrus
hops
in
the
front
of
the
palate
as
it
hits
the
back
of
the
palate
you
get
a
bit
of
that
acidic
champagne
like
dry
belgian
yeast
the
yeast
also
provides
a
nice
crisp
finish
another
great
job
guys
enough
said
youll
forgive
me
if
i
say
egg
nog
a
weird
spiciness
more
wild
than
belgian
but
i
like
it
this
is
exactly
as
advertised
an
american
ipa
mixed
with
belgian
yeast
the
result
is
an
interesting
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
improves
greatly
as
it
warms
very
unique
and
special
edition
of
little
sumpin
good
beer
but
i
like
the
regular
little
sumpin
better
the
hops
in
this
are
a
little
to
much
and
it
makes
it
seem
a
little
out
of
balance
very
disapointed
worst
of
the
lil
sumpin
line
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
had
working
off
old
notes
will
update
with
more
details
ifwhen
i
have
another
glass
tulip
very
good
beer
just
not
my
favorite
of
the
little
sumpin
line
pours
a
nice
almost
crystal
clear
medium
gold
with
a
nice
cap
of
foamy
white
head
the
head
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
some
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
lighter
with
some
nice
tropical
fruit
and
floral
notes
the
taste
is
a
little
restrained
and
comes
off
just
a
touch
washed
out
there
is
still
a
nice
dank
hoppy
bite
on
the
finish
but
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
feels
like
its
missing
the
body
has
a
nice
weight
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
good
flavor
in
the
mouth
though
not
spectacular
thisll
be
a
good
goto
for
a
party
poured
into
my
teku
glass
beer
looks
very
much
like
a
macro
but
the
scent
is
awesome
fresh
hops
and
the
taste
is
superb
lagunitas
sure
knows
how
to
brew
a
beer
note
when
this
was
first
released
i
detected
more
nuances
of
the
wild
yeast
than
i
did
a
few
weeks
later
in
different
packs
its
not
quite
as
exciting
the
2nd
or
3rd
time
around
its
not
a
replacement
for
the
lil
sumpin
but
a
great
twist
nonetheless
lagunitass
sumpin
subtle
floral
honey
undertones
balance
the
brewerys
characteristic
hop
profile
this
one
is
just
a
bit
lighter
and
sweeter
than
the
rest
of
the
ales
from
this
brewery
nice
spiced
fruit
and
floral
aroma
same
for
the
flavor
up
front
with
a
smooth
sweety
and
sticky
bitter
finish
yet
another
good
one
from
lagunitas
delicious
and
lightly
fruity
taste
i
really
like
this
it
does
mirror
raging
bitch
from
flying
dog
its
just
that
unique
sour
peppery
something
with
a
bite
id
drink
it
again
im
close
minded
so
take
that
into
account
cant
get
over
the
belgian
yeast
taste
have
to
focus
with
each
sip
or
get
a
gag
reflex
otherwise
not
bad
not
bad
for
the
high
abv
id
drink
it
again
good
job
lagunitas
very
odd
wild
flavor
nothing
is
too
distinguishable
enough
to
get
a
true
sense
of
the
brew
good
not
great
drinkable
for
the
abv
but
my
taste
buds
arent
that
impressed
uneventful
as
a
belgian
ipa
or
wild
ale
delicious
lagunitas
continues
to
impress
the
least
of
the
sumpins
seriously
impressive
beer
the
belgian
yeast
does
wonders
here
combined
with
the
fruity
and
wheaty
base
light
upfront
florals
and
citrusy
fruit
but
then
also
a
great
depth
of
farmhouse
yeast
some
tropical
fruit
notes
and
spicy
earthy
notes
lovely
lovely
beer
each
sip
keeps
you
on
your
toes
and
bring
new
flavours
loved
this
price
point
1

oz
single
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
almost
pithy
but
without
the
citrusy
element
if
that
makes
sense
but
also
a
high
note
of
candi
sweet
also
the
fact
that
its
almost
9
is
quite
evident
here
great
beer
a
decent
lagunitas
offering
overall
a
very
solid
beer
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
in
flavor
but
goes
down
like
an
ipa
i
would
buy
this
again
love
this
beer
brings
two
great
styles
crashing
together
into
a
wonderful
mix
on
draft
12oz
in
a
goblet
great
yeast
aroma
fruity
with
a
good

a

definitely
buy

like
notes
to
be
honest
my
expectations
fell
at
this
point
i
have
never
had
a
belgian
ipa
that
i
really
liked
all
that
changed
taste
is
that
same
belgian
yeast
and
citrus
from
appropriately
selected
hops
but
there
is
a
pleasant
malty
sweetness
that
makes
this
beer
work
all
too
often
belgian
ipas
end
up
too
dry
and
the
bitterness
is
poorly
balanced
and
unpleasant
not
so
here
great
job
mouthfeel
is
on
point
with
that
nice
stickeyness
ipas
should
have
again
great
beer
overall
very
drinkable
even
with
the
higher
abv
very
nice
balance
between
a
belgian
beer
and
ipa
cold
is
this
beers
friend
drink
it
quick
it
does
turn
to
an
off
flavor
quickly
with
time
that
being
said
it
is
a
fruity
hoppy
clean
crisp
beer
when
cold
this
rating
is
based
on
a
colder
temp
was
really
good
at
first
and
easy
to
drink
but
became
worse
with
a
stronger
lingering
alcohol
taste
and
smell
o
this
is
a
fantastic
belgian
style
iipa
not
to
funky
and
hoppy
in
all
the
right
ways
this
ale
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
reminiscent
of
their
extra
offering
with
some
nice
zesty
pepper
rind
and
funk
mixed
in
great
stuff
at
another
insanely
low
price
point
osomewhere
between
an
ipa
and
saison
really
good
beer
very
drinkable
abv
well
hidden
to
the
point
of
danger
well
done
and
will
be
buying
more
of
this
one
4
35
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
blue
cheese
funk
lagunitas
makes
some
great
beers
and
this
is
one
of
them
i
really
like
a
little
sumpin
i
love
its
wild
sister
if
im
reading
the
bottle
correctly
this
may
have
been
brewed
in
may
2014
and
im
seeing
it
in
my
area
of
frederick
md
for
first
time
in
early
november
2014
56
months
have
to
say
it
is
very
similar
to
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
in
most
all
attributes
had
a
rb
just
the
other
day
perhaps
this
one
has
a
tad
extra
bitterness
in
finish
but
overall
this
is
yet
another
very
solid
brew
from
lagunitas
overall
no
question
that
it
is
a
lagunitas
brew
and
these
guys
are
set
up
nicely
for
this
style
or
mash
up
it
has
a
lot
of
good
interesting
stuff
going
on
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
in
lagunitas
mason
jar
glass
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
1
inch
frothy
head
very
well
carbonated
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
for
lack
of
a
better
term
is
very
lagunitas
i
think
all
their
beers
have
a
certain
aroma
that
clearly
defines
them
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
sweetness
up
front
then
a
more
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
terrific
very
smooth
overall
another
very
good
beer
by
lagunitas
they
really
have
yet
to
disappoint
me
in
any
of
their
offerings
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
glass
a
very
nice
dark
golden
yellow
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
very
very
nice
thick
creamy
two
plus
finger
head
which
leaves
some
very
thick
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
hoppy
but
with
a
nice
malty
sweetness
thrown
in
slightly
yeasty
slightly
citrusy
the
taste
is
very
nice
hoppy
malty
kinda
chewy
and
citrusy
medium
body
with
a
nice
bitter
slightly
dry
finish
overall
another
very
tasty
brew
from
lagunitas
ill
say
it
again
and
ive
said
it
for
years
for
the
price
its
very
hard
to
beat
this
brewery
o
4
the
aromas
are
very
nice
on
this
beer
and
it
would
be
much
better
if
the
flavors
matched
the
complexity
from
the
nose
a
bit
more
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
it
is
quite
drinkable
however
there
are
more
interesting
options
out
there
12
oz
bottle
taste
is
a
grapefruit
flavor
with
a
touch
of
bitterness

i
liked
this
i
goes
down
really
nice
another
one
of
lagunitas
great
brews
threw
back
a
couple
of
these
last
night
and
they
were
going
down
real
nice
give
it
a
try
i
was
impressed
with
this
belgian
from
lag
very
well
balanced
lots
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
a
little
bit
of
funk
and
a
nice
touch
of
malt
in
the
backbone
will
buy
more
this
season
fore
sure
i
have
tried
like
100
different
beers
since
the
summer
and
i
have
to
say
everything
i
have
from
lagunitas
has
been
wonderful
this
beer
will
give
long
strange
tripel
a
run
for
its
money
o
fun
way
too
drinkable
ipa
love
the
base
beer
and
this
is
a
great
variant
poured
a
slightly
hazy
dark
yellow
with
a
nice
inch
of
head
nice
lacing
aroma
isnt
huge
but
i
get
some
slight
pineapple
a
little
bit
of
slight
yeasty
funk
and
some
grassy
notes
the
taste
is
much
bigger
than
the
smell
with
lots
of
pineapple
mango
and
biscuit
along
with
that
funky
yeasty
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
add
some
good
bite
to
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
this
8

beer
overall
this
is
another
outstanding
beer
from
lagunitas
as
expected

hoppy

strong
ale
enjoyable
a
great
fall
back
beer
solid
poured
into
a
pint
glass
orange
due
and
12
inch
head
that
stays
around
and
sticks
to
the
side
i
had
just
brewed
an
all
motueka
hop
ipa
that
looks
almost
identical
poured
so
i
have
high
hopes
from
the
start
plus
lagunitas
is
a
great
brewery
it
still
retains
a
nice
hoppy
nose
although
i
should
have
finished
off
the
bottles
long
ago
for
a
fresher
hop
flavor
i
wasnt
expecting
a
typical
westcoast
ipa
flavor
based
on
the
trappist
yeast
and
knowing
it
was
an
attempt
at
a
belgian
version
of
the
regular
little
sumpin
but
it
remains
very
westcoast
in
flavor
profile
with
just
bit
of
the
phenolic
flavor
profile
i
expected
still
it
is
hard
to
complain
when
it
is
absolutely
delicious
just
not
exactly
what
i
expected
somewhere
between
fruity
and
peppery
nice
bite
but
not
harsh
overall
well
balanced
with
adequate
malt
but
finishes
appropriately
dry
i
will
definately
add
this
to
my
regular
inventory
o
good
stuff
even
if
it
is
all
malt
at
this
point
i
need
to
get
a
fresh
one
mouthfeel
is
right
with
my
favorites
the
hops
recycle
nicely
allowing
me
to
draw
out
the
pint
and
linger
over
the
delicious
flavors
o
this
is
a
surprising
ipa
that
i
have
overlooked
glad
i
tried
it
pours
a
bit
of
a
golden
yellow
slightly
unfiltered
look
lot
of
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
a
bit
mild
a
little
boozy
and
hoppy
pineapple
the
flavor
is
wonderful
got
a
lot
of
bubblegum
up
front
and
a
pale
ale
ish
quality
with
the
malts
a
little
salty
and
tart
grapefruity
overall
very
nice
has
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
fluffy
white
head
that
holds
on
nicely
looks
to
be
well
carbonated
smell
is
awesome
real
spicy
smell
can
really
pick
up
on
the
spice
in
the
taste
and
it
blends
well
with
the
citrus
and
sweetness
not
a
very
bitter
ipa
with
only
bitterness
at
very
end
this
beer
is
extremely
good
nice
fizzy
feel
yet
very
creamy
overall
this
is
one
great
beer
form
a
great
brewery
lagunitas
ipas
never
seem
to
disappoint
me
o
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
it
had
huge
aromas
and
flavors
and
was
extremely
well
balanced
there
was
a
lot
going
on
and
it
all
was
awesome
i
would
have
again
in
a
heartbeat
comparing
this
belgian
ipa
to
likes
of
piraat
wild
ale
is
much
different
resembling
more
an
american
ipa
american
hops
are
evident
with
a
tad
of
sweetness
aroma
of
molasses
pine
and
light
fruitiness
carbonation
is
high
feels
almost
like
drinking
soda
full
bodied
nonexistent
head
bitter
pleasant
aftertaste
lingers
for
a
little
bit
overall
decent
ale
but
was
looking
forward
to
try
this
and
it
did
not
meet
my
expectations
this
beer
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
every
time
i
have
a
whitebelgian
ipa
i
am
pissed
that
i
dont
give
it
more
attention
ill
buy
this
anytime
trademark
aggressive
lagunitas
flavor
hopping
meets
a
trappist
yeast
strain
how
could
this
conceivably
suck
of
course
it
couldnt
in
fact
is
pretty
freaking
amazing
a
peachy
orange
color
very
fizzy
quite
cloudy
and
with
a
whole
shit
ton
of
yeast
and
hop
character
on
the
nose
smells
and
tastes
of
sugary
caramel
malts
saltwater
taffy
rye
bread
juicy
red
grapefruit
blood
oranges
canned
mandarins
pine
resin
woody
pineapple
and
nondescript
wildflowers
spicy
phenols
abound
and
remind
one
of
caraway
cumin
and
white
pepper
these
and
the
strong
piney
hop
resins
prevent
things
from
becoming
cloyingly
sweet
nicely
balancing
out
the
influence
of
the
fairly
syrupy
body
and
saccharine
citrustropical
flavors
there
is
a
pleasant
degree
of
aromatic
alcohol
character
i
actually
brought
a
few
of
these
to
a
house
party
despite
figuring
that
this
sort
of
thing
would
be
too
much
for
most
people
in
fact
two
of
my
good
buddies
were
angry
that
i
did
not
bring
more
mmm
boozy
pineapple
juice
apparently
a
belgian
ipa
done
right
can
score
new
fans
and
this
is
a
worldclass
brew
redolent
with
complexity
and
yet
balanced
enough
to
be
drinkable
in
quantity
but
watch
the
abv
seriously
wonderful
surprise
and
well
done
great
balance
of
the
belgian
and
american
ipawell
integrated
be
carefuldrinks
like
a
6
beer
this
beer
was
about
three
months
after
bottling
date
and
was
really
good
alcohol
is
well
hidden
so
take
it
easy
o
hybrid
of
a
belgian
and
american
ipa
presenting
westmalles
yeast
with
more
americanthemed
hop
character
wellcrafted
and
easy
to
drink
amazing
pour
the
pour
resembles
the
woman
on
the
packaging
beautiful
classy
catches
the
eye
and
resembles
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
smells
like
belgian
yeast
slightly
and
has
a
saison
touch
to
the
smell
its
strong
pungent
aftertaste
lends
it
to
be
paired
well
with
meats
and
vegetables
i
love
the
taste
and
aftertaste
of
the
wild
yeast
strain
it
has
a
creamy
almost
elusive
bitterness
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
well
done
beer
owow
first
bottle
and
im
jumping
in
to
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
an
experimental
palate
ride
that
one
will
always
enjoy
love
the
lady
on
the
sumpin
bottles
she
makes
me
smile
i
smile
belgian
ipas
will
be
the
soon
popular
trend
gets
most
points
for
mouthfeel
and
complex
sensory
qualities
overall
very
nice
more
balance
of
ipa
and
belgian
flavors
than
most
ive
had
i
wish
i
had
it
fresh
for
hops
sake
but
its
still
great
now
though
classified
as
a
belgian
ipa
this
reminded
me
more
of
a
belgian
witbier
with
a
moderate
bretty
tartness
and
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
seeing
as
this
is
a
summer
seasonal
my
guess
is
that
this
keg
had
been
sat
on
for
a
good
six
months
which
allowed
the
bretty
qualities
to
intensify
and
the
hops
to
fade
regardless
this
is
a
very
impressive
offering
from
the
folks
at
lagunitas
and
one
that
i
will
be
revisiting
when
the
warmer
weather
rolls
around
again
o
this
is
money
nice
simplicity
with
the
citrus
hops
and
a
balanced
yeast
strain
that
just
explodes
in
greatness
not
overly
complex
but
well
blended
flavor
profiles
create
a
delicious
bipa
that
i
would
purchase
frequently
cheers
a
different
and
funky
offering
from
lagunitas
o
a
good
overall
beer
i
think
the
bitterness
lingered
a
bit
long
but
the
orangey
flavors
with
the
funk
on
the
yeast
mingled
well
with
the
hops
overall
a
good
beer
lots
of
bitterness
and
hints
of
spice
but
not
as
flavorful
as
the
best
high
ibu
ales
takes
a
bit
of
effort
for
me
to
get
it
down
this
style
has
lots
of
variety
but
this
is
not
something
im
crazy
about
even
brown
shugga
which
im
not
a
fan
of
has
more
oomph
than
this
for
me
just
okay
i
think
there
are
much
better
options
like
piraat
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
good
balance
of
the
hoppy
ipa
with
belgian
wild
funk
i
find
myself
drinking
this
a
bit
too
fast
for
a
8
abv
beer
but
thats
only
because
its
so
darn
good
i
recommend
nice
beer
definitely
on
the
hoppier
side
of
belgian
ipa
nice
balance
of
bitter
hops
with
the
yeast
yum
good
alternative
to
the
classic
ipa
flavors
solid
beer
caramel
notes
jump
out
to
me
light
buttery
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
buy
again
probably
wouldnt
brag
about
it
though
i
dont
know
if
the
flavor
combination
works
perfectly
but
it
definitely
is
very
very
interesting
and
it
doesnt
come
across
bad
at
all
the
worst
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
i
dont
want
to
drink
it
every
day
its
just
odd
enough
that
it
becomes
a
special
occasion
beer
interesting
beer
for
sure
nice
bitterness
and
very
complex
the
dirty
citrustropical
fruit
works
well
against
the
sweet
pale
malt
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
and
they
got
better
and
better
this
is
one
to
seek
out
o
the
sweetness
that
seems
apparent
in
the
aroma
is
restrained
and
the
finish
brings
a
healthy
dose
of
bitterness
a
well
balanced
version
of
a
belgian
ipa
that
is
recommended
wow
what
a
nice
way
to
approach
this
recipe
get
one
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
soft
the
yeastiness
balances
the
bitterness
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
good
example
of
what
this
style
can
be
overall
i
am
not
sure
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
brew
but
it
is
delicious
definitely
something
i
will
have
again
in
the
future
o
if
this
wasnt
so
overly
boozy
it
would
be
better
i
like
the
flavors
but
its
too
hot
and
that
takes
a
lot
away
from
it
the
belgian
ipa
may
be
a
fairly
new
style
but
i
would
call
this
a
pretty
definitive
and
delicious
example
of
one
as
stated
before
i
have
held
this
in
high
regard
for
a
long
time
so
my
review
may
be
a
bit
biased
but
this
hides
the
8
8
abv
like
nobodies
business
and
is
drinkable
to
boot
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
any
ipa
fan
as
it
is
sure
not
to
disappoint
true
to
style
and
worth
revisiting
im
stocked
up
but
will
be
sad
to
see
this
go
out
of
season
a
very
good
belgian
ipa
and
worth
drinking
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
overall
solid
a
good
representation
of
this
particular
style
overall
an
interesting
wild
ale
im
not
sure
if
an
belgian
ipa
is
quite
my
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
cool
beer
to
come
from
the
sumpin
series
loved
the
mango
aroma
too
that
really
got
me
just
a
very
big
beer
a
little
bit
of
maltiness
mellows
the
bang
of
hops
you
get
through
out
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
yet
another
good
beer
put
out
by
lagunitas
pretty
similar
to
the
sumpin
sumpin
ale
anybody
who
appreciates
a
west
coast
style
hoppy
bitter
bomb
of
a
beer
this
dipa
is
for
you
ps
the
yeast
flavors
are
more
apparent
after
this
beer
warms
therefore
im
adjusting
my
ratings
accordingly
o
not
as
sweet
as
most
lagunitas
a
more
down
to
earth
pun
intended
offering
was
just
what
i
was
looking
for
today
will
have
to
remember
this
is
different
from
any
other
lagunitas
offering
edit
agree
with
this
statement
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
bitterness
is
fairly
assertive
but
is
balanced
out
by
the
malt
the
belgian
character
adds
a
nice
fruitiness
and
a
twist
right
when
you
think
you
have
figured
this
beer
out
found
this
at
a
small
liquor
store
up
the
street
i
was
already
a
lagunitas
fan
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
was
not
disappointed
nice
appearance
good
foamy
head
about
one
finger
smells
of
a
familiar
ipa
citrusy
and
lemony
just
like
a
good
summer
beer
should
tastes
hoppy
as
soon
as
it
hits
the
tongue
some
spice
and
sourness
mixed
here
well
bodied
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
going
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
not
as
good
as
hop
devil
but
thats
in
my
top
5
o
somewhat
disappointed
expect
more
complexity
in
flavor
and
a
fuller
mouthfeel
out
of
a
good
higher
abv
beer
this
beer
had
qualities
of
a
session
beer
and
was
inappropriate
for
an
abv
of
8
8
great
brew
love
the
style
and
this
one
delivers
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chimay
goblet
generates
some
short
head
that
levels
down
pretty
quickly
beer
is
totally
clarified
and
effervescing
from
the
etching
at
the
bottom
of
the
goblet
the
nose
on
this
is
very
interesting
theres
candied
citrus
fruit
as
well
as
pine
and
then
some
yeasty
funk
there
is
no
detectable
alcohol
on
the
nose
but
pushing
nine
percent
definitely
has
a
tiny
bite
to
it
and
a
warming
quality
certainly
not
overpowering
though
and
seems
to
be
blending
in
with
the
hop
bitters
almost
seamlessly
flavor
is
citrusysweet
some
peachiness
mango
and
certainly
a
grapefruitlike
bitterness
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
slightly
sticky
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
i
like
the
fruitfunk
and
hopcitrus
combo
and
i
think
this
is
well
done
for
the
style
if
anything
id
like
more
funkiness
to
it
but
i
think
they
took
it
to
a
good
place
regardless
nice
d
hoppy
belgian
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
must
try
overall
a
delicious
highly
complex
beer
the
yeast
seem
to
have
made
the
most
impact
on
the
nose
and
create
an
enticing
beer
well
done
overall
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
couple
more
of
the
same
style
to
really
compare
because
this
one
is
so
good
i
might
adjust
the
scores
when
i
have
a
bit
more
of
this
style
under
my
belt
but
a
slightly
different
take
on
a
style
im
getting
pretty
use
to
ipa
so
that
makes
it
a
very
refreshing
changeup
o
lagunitas
is
just
like
motorhead
they
tend
to
always
tastesound
the
same
from
beer
to
beeralbum
to
album
but
when
that
tastesound
is
so
damn
good
it
really
doesnt
matter
yes
this
is
just
another
hoppy
lagunitas
beer
and
i
dont
care
because
this
is
really
damn
good
total
4650
pours
a
fairly
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
bone
white
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
lemon
and
spice
with
a
bit
of
pepper
grass
hay
and
earth
light
bready
wheat
malt
pulls
it
altogether
the
flavor
is
quite
resinous
with
grass
hay
citrus
and
pine
light
pepper
and
yeasty
phenols
with
a
hint
of
light
sugar
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
resinous
almost
chalky
mouthfeel
meh
too
many
contrasting
flavors
for
my
palette
the
yeasty
phenols
and
the
resinous
hop
treatment
are
left
unchecked
by
too
light
of
a
malty
base
this
didnt
work
for
me
i
have
had
the
little
sumpin
several
times
so
i
was
waiting
to
see
what
this
little
extra
wild
thing
did
for
me
it
do
not
do
what
i
was
hoping
for
it
still
was
a
good
brew
a
nice
amount
of
hops
the
nice
was
maltycitrus
was
was
very
special
the
first
taste
it
had
a
good
amount
of
hops
but
as
i
was
drinking
it
the
malt
start
coming
through
loud
and
clear
enjoyable
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
o
this
is
a
nice
belgian
ipa
tasty
and
easy
drinking
overall
4
55
a
little
sumpin
wild
is
another
excellent
lagunitas
beer
the
hops
yeast
and
malt
fire
on
all
cylinders
making
this
the
best
belgianstyle
ipa
that
ive
had
odefinitely
a
lagunitas
beer
big
west
coast
hoppy
beer
with
a
very
minor
belgian
influence
a
bit
too
west
coast
ipa
bitter
pine
resin
taste
for
me
but
this
is
a
damn
flavorful
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
worth
a
shot
would
have
preferred
this
as
a
22
ounce
bomber
instead
the
six
pack
i
purchased
whatever
ill
drink
them
happily
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
lagunitas
however
this
is
a
slight
departure
in
style
a
belgian
ipa
westmalle
yeast
and
more
maltiness
to
the
beer
o
this
is
a
great
combo
a
west
coast
master
of
ipa
meets
the
belgian
style
i
like
the
richness
of
it
and
the
warmth
that
the
booze
provides
in
fact
it
tastes
like
its
more
than
the
8
abv
posted
above
its
a
sipping
beer
whereas
most
of
the
other
lagunitas
beers
are
so
good
you
dont
realize
how
fast
you
drink
them
not
this
one
wild
seems
a
little
more
mature
and
sophisticated
than
its
siblings
i
really
enjoyed
this
rich
and
complex
ale
everything
i
always
wanted
little
sumpin
sumpin
to
be
little
sweeter
and
more
kick
worthy
of
a
case
as
i
expect
it
will
sit
well
says
it
is
a
summer
release
currently
late
summer
and
this
is
perfect
for
bringing
in
the
fall
on
my
second
bottle
cheers
this
is
the
kind
of
stuff
which
i
will
never
write
as
i
am
a
beer
drinker
not
a
beer
connoisseur
actually
i
had
to
look
up
the
spelling
on
that
word
but
i
contend
nevertheless
based
on
50
years
of
beer
drinking
experience
that
this
is
one
not
to
be
missed
o
this
is
a
great
spinoff
of
the
already
wonderful
pale
ale
not
sour
like
i
had
expected
but
bitter
with
the
flashy
cloves
and
hops
that
a
belgian
ipa
should
have
certainly
a
hallmark
for
the
style
1010
will
drink
again
overall
this
is
another
very
solid
effort
by
lagunitas
it
is
not
my
favorite
effort
from
them
but
it
is
very
drinkable
o
very
well
made
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
worth
waiting
for
easily
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
had
lots
of
tropical
aromas
and
flavor
masterfully
balanced
true
to
lagunitas
fashion
clean
refreshing
big
flavor
alcohol
is
hidden
well
if
you
like
lagunitas
or
belgian
ipas
or
just
great
beer
buy
as
much
of
this
as
you
can
when
you
see
it
a
good
beer
but
you
could
barely
notice
that
it
was
in
the
belgian
style
i
drank
it
anyway
aside
from
its
namesake
cousin
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
to
compare
this
to
that
alone
says
something
whole
heartedly
agree
with
the
others
that
have
described
this
as
a
bucket
list
beer
big
and
beguiling
good
luck
trying
to
figure
it
out
or
pin
it
down
this
isnt
a
wild
ale
in
terms
of
being
soured
or
with
bacteria
added
its
more
of
a
wild
take
on
the
original
brew
there
are
no
sour
flavors
or
funkiness
in
that
regard
although
the
trappist
yeast
thrown
into
the
mix
does
give
off
hints
of
a
slight
funk
the
wild
poured
a
golden
amber
with
a
substantial
fluffy
white
head
there
were
loads
of
the
signature
citrusy
lagunitas
hops
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
funk
underneath
from
the
belgian
yeast
the
taste
was
big
juicy
citrus
and
fruit
hops
with
belgian
yeast
flavors
coming
through
on
the
end
the
westmalle
yeast
gave
it
a
bit
of
funk
though
not
to
the
brett
levels
but
nicely
undertoned
and
complementary
to
the
juicy
hops
loving
this
one
mf
medium
to
heavy
bodied
beer
smooth
even
creamy
finish
with
a
slight
bite
of
bitterness
o
i
cant
believe
how
much
im
enjoying
this
to
be
honest
with
you
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
not
normally
a
style
i
particularly
care
for
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
another
great
hoppy
offering
from
lagunitas
would
like
to
get
this
again
a
very
well
done
belgian
ipa
great
balance
in
yeast
and
hop
character
with
the
wheat
adding
a
smooth
creamy
body
overall
lagunitas
has
to
be
the
ipa
king
when
it
comes
to
variety
and
versatility
this
gem
feels
like
its
the
cherry
on
top
i
think
i
just
might
have
to
buy
another
six
pack
before
the
they
run
out
by
my
local
spot
drink
up
and
enjoy
salud
7
99
for
6
pack
i
like
the
regular
sumpin
more
but
this
may
be
available
in
a
keg
so
im
test
driving
tonight
im
a
belgian
ipa
rookie
so
the
wild
yeast
strain
does
take
a
bit
getting
used
to
it
kind
of
tastes
like
a
really
really
good
blue
moon
the
color
body
and
hop
profile
are
typical
lagunitas
which
is
always
a
good
thing
definitely
worth
a
sixer
and
maybe
a
keg
now
ive
got
to
score
a
lucky13
since
that
comes
in
kegs
too
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
last
night
i
have
always
liked
the
beers
from
lagunitas
they
do
a
great
job
with
their
hops
and
consistency
although
i
liked
this
beer
it
was
tough
for
me
to
notice
the
wild
or
belgian
influence
to
me
the
beer
tasted
similar
to
the
other
ipas
which
are
really
good
they
make
and
didnt
have
the
wild
yeast
characteristics
i
was
expecting
spice
clove
bubble
gum
etc
and
although
i
could
tell
there
was
something
different
about
this
one
the
hop
profile
seemed
to
just
dominate
the
entire
beer
so
in
all
the
beer
was
really
enjoyable
it
just
didnt
have
the
wild
character
i
was
expecting
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
is
decent
mild
lacing
has
a
deep
citrus
aroma
with
hints
of
belgian
yeasts
and
slight
hoppiness
hop
forward
taste
ending
in
a
bitter
citrus
belgian
yeast
malt
nice
bitter
aftertaste
slightly
soapy
very
good
beer
this
may
be
an
improvement
on
last
years
release
o
tasty
and
easy
drinking
wild
ale
with
wellhidden
high
abv
not
my
favorite
lagunitas
but
a
very
good
one
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
big
creamy
head
lots
of
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
and
candy
maybe
bubble
gum
a
good
smell
mouth
feel
is
both
bitter
and
sweet
very
sharp
the
flavor
is
grapefruit
and
spice
from
the
hops
and
the
yeast
respective
this
brew
is
much
more
on
the
belgium
side
of
ales
very
funky
in
in
the
taste
department
from
the
wild
yeast
another
great
hoppy
beer
from
lagunitas
i
really
dig
their
hop
profile
overall
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
i
probably
like
the
regular
sumpin
a
little
better
but
this
was
a
cool
take
on
the
beer
i
can
appreciate
a
strong
hop
focus
but
sometimes
it
just
gets
to
be
too
much
i
think
that
is
the
case
here
the
hop
characteristics
are
so
aggressive
against
the
rest
of
the
beer
that
it
just
pushes
everything
out
of
balance
o
overall
not
as
ipa
like
as
im
used
to
with
even
a
belgian
ipa
still
not
bad
pours
an
orange
brown
with
a
12
finger
head
the
head
retreats
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
some
real
lacing
behind
smell
hits
like
a
regular
belgian
though
the
hop
is
a
lot
easier
to
notice
in
taste
its
fairly
complex
a
wall
of
yeast
hits
first
followed
by
a
big
hit
of
hops
and
bitterness
alcohol
is
certainly
not
hidden
in
this
beer
it
provides
characteristic
warming
but
also
seems
to
be
a
bit
punchier
than
i
am
used
to
alcohol
is
more
of
a
flavor
than
a
sensation
if
that
makes
sense
the
beer
is
not
too
heavy
in
the
mouth
i
think
its
a
little
smoother
than
most
american
ipas
overall
its
a
delicious
beerim
really
starting
to
warm
up
to
lagunitas
and
its
not
just
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
of
their
beer
overall
a
very
solid
belgian
ipa
a
great
concept
using
the
sumpin
sumpin
base
very
good
belgian
flavors
with
keeping
the
strong
hop
and
wheat
base
o
a
lot
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
certainly
not
as
wild
by
wild
ale
standards
but
a
nice
twist
on
the
standard
ipa
hop
lovers
should
be
happy
as
hops
certainly
dominate
but
not
overwhelm
two
of
my
favorite
beers
meet
at
last
to
gleefully
great
results
the
dried
citruswheat
profile
of
little
sumpin
sumpin
combines
very
well
with
the
spiciness
and
funkiness
from
the
westmalle
yeast
making
this
very
tropical
zesty
and
complex
overall
the
aftertaste
goes
on
forever
on
this
thing
id
drink
it
more
often
if
it
werent
so
goddamn
boozy
overall
well
hidden
booziness
at
that
but
this
is
better
and
way
more
closer
to
style
than
most
american
made
officially
titled
tripels
brewed
in
the
country
great
stuff
ill
always
seek
this
out
when
i
get
the
chance
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
poured
with
a
dense
white
foam
that
very
slowly
reduced
to
a
soapy
cap
that
left
huge
sticky
sheets
on
the
glass
belgian
yeast
and
sweet
malt
and
spicy
aromas
down
the
middle
with
sharp
tropical
fruit
aromas
on
the
edges
and
a
touch
of
banana
sweetness
beneath
medium
bodied
with
rich
lazy
carbonation
that
tapers
to
a
slick
oily
finish
flavor
is
similar
to
aroma
solid
bready
sweet
malty
backbone
throught
intense
pugent
hop
flavors
through
the
middle
that
turn
tropical
at
the
end
a
touch
of
banana
sweetness
at
the
finish
followed
by
lingering
tropical
and
pine
hop
bitterness
a
wide
variety
of
aromas
and
flavors
with
that
signature
lagunitas
spicy
malty
sweetness
o
this
is
a
really
good
belgian
ipa
this
particular
example
tastes
really
fresh
i
think
they
do
a
great
job
at
striking
a
balance
between
two
styles
drinks
really
easy
and
was
a
very
enjoyable
experience
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
ipa
not
too
wild

beer
im
surprised
no
one
has
mentioned
the
clove
tastearoma
this
beer
almost
tastes
like
a
good
belgian
and
even
has
some
heffe
taste
going
on
with
it
not
a
beer
easy
to
lump
into
one
distinct
style
imo
complex
brew
great
tasting
and
great
smelling
brew
i
would
highly
recommend
it
has
that
clovecoriandercardamomyeasty
finish
of
a
good
trappist
ale
a
must
try
beer
overall
i
didnt
have
much
of
a
problem
going
through
the
entire
bottle
and
i
did
sip
on
this
for
an
hour
or
two
the
only
nitpic
i
have
is
that
it
was
little
too
sweet
and
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
too
minimal
i
have
to
state
that
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
for
what
it
was
and
all
the
interesting
characteristics
together
and
i
enjoyed
comparing
the
differences
between
this
and
the
regular
sumpin
ale
overall
a
good
belgian
ipa
that
i
would
personally
have
to
classify
as
a
double
ipatripelgerman
hefeweizen
i
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
who
really
enjoys
the
yearround
available
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
o
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
there
is
no
way
in
hell
that
you
can
beat
3

bombers
from
lagunitas
d
phenomenal
aroma
i
could
sniff
this
for
hours
wonderfully
resiny
mouthfeel
hard
to
imagine
something
better
than
this
in
those
categories
poured
a
brilliant
mediumdeep

with
a
barely
perceptible

offwhite
creamy
1inch
head
forms
settles
slowly
but
persists
at
14
inch
beautiful
welldeveloped
belgian
lace
after
each
sip
the
nose
intermingles
yeasty
notes
with
distinct
hops
tropical
fruit
citrus
wood
and
cloves
light
and
delicious
on
the
palate
with
excellent
balance
that
hides
the
8

abv
but
dont
be
fooled
the
abv
is
there
lingers
well
but
leaves
a
clean
palate
with
hints
of
hop
flavors
hopbitterness
citrus
and
cloves
moderate
carbonation
with
tiny
bubbles
expected
more
sourness
given
the
wild
descriptor
however
it
is
delicious
the
moreishness
increases
as
it
rises
toabove
cellar
temperature
would
be
excellent
with
rich
or
fatty
foods
needing
to
be
balanced
with
the
increasingly
evident
hop
i
chose
a
duvel
tulip
for
the
occasion
of
this
session
and
a
little
sumpin
wild
ale
looked
very
nice
in
it
with
the
clear
orange
body
and
a
two
finger
thick
head
the
aroma
was
not
exactly
wild
but
it
was
very
edgy
due
to
the
aggressive
hop
presence
which
asserted
itself
as
papaya
pine
tangerine
and
mango
the
taste
was
not
sweet
like
the
aroma
hinted
at
instead
the
beer
was
dry
tart
and
smooth
with
just
a
touch
of
radish
like
spiciness
in
the
finish
very
delicate
in
the
feel
and
very
sneaky
in
the
alcohol
expression
this
was
like
a
dirty
duvel
i
like
the
unusual
combination
of
characteristics
that
work
in
this
creation
odelicious
belgian
ipa
good
flavor
and
balance
ok
so
little
sumpin
was
a
great
beer
looks
like
all
they
really
did
was
change
the
yeast
which
honestly
made
it
a
completely
different
beast
well
done
lagunitas
love
the
whole
belgoamerican
movement
love
lagunitas
as
well
very
well
balanced
westmalle
yeast
battles
dank
hop
in
a
higher
alcohol
arena
everything
a
growing
palate
needs
giving
this
brew
a
hearty
hell
yeah
a
decent
brew
special
yeast
pours
a
radiant
bronze
color
with
an
erupting
off
white
head
that
stopped
just
short
of
needing
to
be
frantically
slurped
it
smells
like
belgian
yeast
west
coast
hops
and
some
fuller
bodied
malts
the
flavor
is
pungent
bitter
hops
and
rubbing
alcohol
in
the
finish
chemically
almost
at
the
end
the
malt
provides
a
huge
amount
of
body
but
only
a
touch
of
sweetness
lots
of
nonfermentable
sweetness
to
this
one
the
yeast
is
of
course
very
interesting
ive
never
had
the
beer
that
made
this
yeast
famous
but
i
can
imagine
it
now
spicy
and
complex
dry
and
ancient
the
feel
is
decent
good
body
on
the
fuller
side
and
a
little
less
carbonated
than
it
should
be
despite
the
head
maybe
it
just
relaxes
too
quickly
im
not
sure
finish
stays
bitter
for
awhile
overall
a
clever
brew
something
ive
come
to
expect
from
lagunitas
but
this
isnt
as
good
as
i
expected
it
to
be
with
the
yeast
the
west
coastness
of
this
beer
overwhelms
it
o
loving
this
beer
you
can
taste
the
belgian
influence
the
sumpin
wild
in
it
overall
a
really
great
version
of
a
belgian
ipa
good
citrus
hop
flavor
that
is
balanced
well
by
the
belgian
yeast
complex
and
tasty
strong
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
more
like
an
ipa
with
fruity
and
yeasty
hints
pours
a
clear
bubbly
golden
amber
with
a
very
thick
and
rather
persistent
pale
cream
head
flavor
is
rich
and
hoppy
with
an
evergreen
undertone
is
this
a
belgian
or
an
imperial
ipa
doesnt
matter
its
delicious
has
fruity
floral
and
yeast
hints
as
well
texture
has
good
body
and
lots
of
sass
and
fizz
catch
this
wild
un
whilst
you
can
pours
a
nice
golden
color
not
a
lot
of
head
but
a
nice
ring
around
the
glass
as
i
drink
it
down
smells
great
hops
some
sweetness
could
just
smell
this
all
day
but
id
rather
drink
it
got
a
nice
hop
bite
and
bitterness
with
the
belgian
sweetness
also
shining
through
mouth
feel
is
great
hop
aftertaste
lingers
and
easy
easy
drinking
got
the
last
6er
of
this
at
my
local
bottle
shop
wish
there
were
a
few
more
pack
left
lol
ill
drink
this
beer
anytime
belgian
ipas
are
always
a
bit
strange
but
can
sometimes
be
enjoyable
the
belgian
yeast
esters
are
just
too
strong
here
and
make
it
a
confusing
beer
cheers
a
cloudy
pour
looks
like
a
belgian
ipa
should
bonus
points
for
the
crazy
amount
of
lace
smell
has
a
big
rush
of
lemon
and
banana
big
belgian
yeast
character
nice
hoppiness
the
taste
is
identical
huge
belgian
flavor
upfront
and
then
an
awesome
wave
of
grapefruit
and
mango
wash
over
the
palate
on
the
finish
love
this
beer
love
this
brewery
color
is
a
light
amber
to
gold
the
head
is
dense
with
outstanding
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
packed
with
delicious
tropical
citrus
scents
grapefruit
mango
pineapple
the
taste
is
as
hoppedup
as
the
smell
suggests
juicy
tart
citrus
flavors
stand
out
while
a
slight
alcohol
taste
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
it
strikes
a
great
balance
a
memorable
drinking
experience
and
i
will
definitely
look
to
buy
this
one
again
drinking
this
with
my
corn
dog
amanda
whilst
eating
ice
cream
weird
combo
i
know
but
we
just
got
done
watching
midget
wrestling
so
its
cool
pours
up
clear
orange
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
is
huge
of
floral
hops
niiiice
tastes
bitter
honey
grapefruit
not
too
much
hop
flavor
as
much
as
there
is
hop
bitterness
nice
again
medium
bodied
smooth
drinkin
i
dig
it
pours
a
semiclear
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
well
retained
white
head
the
scent
is
yeast
with
a
mix
of
hops
and
banana
the
taste
is
smooth
and
inviting
it
starts
off
sweet
from
the
malts
banana
and
citrus
but
finishes
slightly
dry
bitter
and
chalky
this
is
overall
tasty
yet
complex
ale
from
lagunitas
orange
in
color
with
some
haze
to
it
the
head
like
a
thick
foam
the
subsides
very
slowly
leaving
tons
of
lacing
lots
of
tropical
fruit
in
the
nose
with
a
sweet
and
sour
tone
pineapples
come
to
mind
there
seems
to
be
some
floral
notes
as
well
very
aromatic
bitter
citrus
sweet
tropical
fruit
floral
undertones
belgian
yeast
and
a
little
alcohol
warmth
come
together
nicely
mouth
fell
is
good
its
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
finish
is
sharp
and
tingly
a
great
beer
to
be
had
lagunitas
has
yet
to
let
me
down
at
5
dollars
a
bomber
you
cant
beat
it
i
would
by
it
again
if
i
saw
it
on
shelves
o
glad
i
finally
picked
it
up
this
is
an
excellent
beer
for
the
style
complex
yet
solid
this
is
a
must
try
imo
not
more
needs
to
be
said
than
that
cheers
overall
a
really
good
beer
another
example
of
how
great
belgianstyle
ipas
are
highly
drinkable
given
the
abv
id
never
turn
this
one
down
m
medium
body
creamy
light
carbonation
overall
tastes
more
like
a
regular
ipa
than
a
belgian
one
to
me
but
still
very
enjoyable
o
nice
variation
of
regular
little
sumpin
belgian
yeast
has
nice
spice
and
some
light
funkiness
d
definitely
a
good
beer
just
not
blown
away
here
hoppy
while
remaining
rather
belgian
not
much
more
for
me
to
say
o
to
me
the
belgian
ipa
style
is
all
about
harmony
between
the
two
distinct
aspects
of
the
beer
the
american
hops
and
the
belgian
yeast
its
a
fine
line
to
walk
and
its
easy
for
one
or
the
other
to
steal
the
show
this
beer
doesnt
quite
achieve
that
harmony
it
starts
out
well
with
a
nice
playful
tasty
hop
profile
but
then
the
yeasty
belgian
aspects
tread
a
little
too
heavily
the
bite
of
clove
pepper
and
spice
just
seems
too
harsh
and
out
of
place
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
get
there
for
me
o
a
great
variation
one
of
my
favorite
styles
lagunitas
makes
some
great
ipas
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
clear
orangeyellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
a
latticework
of
tiny
dots
and
foamy
rings
of
lace
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
citrus
zest
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
medium
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
with
a
minor
notice
of
the
alcohol
overall
an
unusual
but
tasty
brew
o
a
great
variation
one
of
my
favorite
styles
lagunitas
makes
some
great
ipas
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
o
this
stuff
is
delicious
and
extremely
drinkable
the
belgian
element
is
a
bit
subdued
but
pleasant
nonetheless
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
m
creamy
and
nice
coats
your
mouth
that
tends
to
stick
with
you
all
night
oi
enjoyed
this
brew
it
is
more
fleshy
than
many
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
which
is
both
good
and
bad
its
good
if
you
like
me
like
fruity
tropical
hops
but
bad
if
you
want
something
a
little
more
concentrated
smells
and
tastes
of
biscuit
malt
light
orange
peel
and
bretty
yeastiness
and
extensive
herbal
grassy
hopping
with
a
dab
of
drying
hotness
and
bandaid
plastic
in
the
finish
im
just
not
sure
what
about
this
beer
deserves
the
adjective
wild
amazing
appearance
notwithstanding
another
great
beer
enjoyed
at
my
place
in
newtown
ct
this
one
is
a
clear
pale
gold
color
with
a
nice
puffy
cover
of
white
and
energeticly
blanketed
with
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
lovely
floral
and
slight
pine
hop
element
with
sweet
fruit
nougattaffy
and
polite
yeast
biscuit
the
flavor
comes
on
with
very
similar
combinations
light
yet
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
bodied
with
very
delicate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
dry
but
smooth
feel
very
easy
drinking
despite
a
subtle
trace
of
alcohol
wheat
very
nice
stuff
a
no
brainer
the
hops
are
citrusy
floral
and
delicious
if
a
little
weak
it
is
well
balanced
against
the
sweetness
though
which
doesnt
cloy
maybe
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
i
prefer
an
ipa
to
be
but
still
a
good
mouthfeel
overall
very
strong
though
the
knowledge
that
a
little
sumpin
wild
exists
out
there
does
diminish
my
enjoyment
a
bit
o
a
very
nicely
done
belgian
ipa
with
a
great
american
twist
the
hops
arent
too
bitter
or
overly
done
but
simply
add
a
great
refreshing
citrusy
aspect
to
the
beer
definitely
worth
a
shot
before
this
great
weather
goes
away
o
straight
4s
though
it
probably
deserves
a
slight
bump
somewhere
great
example
of
the
style
and
recommended
though
i
still
prefer
the
vanilla
little
sumpin
sumpin
o
a
good
ipa
all
in
all
although
not
my
style
of
beer
obvious
citra
hops
in
there
but
ladunitas
loves
the
c
hops
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
goldenyellow
coloring
with
a
filmy
sparse
white
film
coating
parts
of
the
surface
aromas
of
bubble
gum
lilac
and
chamomile
ride
a
subtle
toffee
backbone
flavors
are
sharply
roasted
with
a
very
spice
dominant
forward
flavor
both
from
the
hops
and
the
yeast
strains
bombardments
of
pepper
and
basil
from
the
hops
combine
with
off
the
wall
characteristics
of
licorice
xantham
gum
lemon
zest
and
cedar
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
very
all
over
the
place
for
lack
of
a
better
term
the
body
is
smooth

5this
beer
poured
a
light
copper
with
a
singlefinger
head
that
lasted
for
a
while
the
smell
is
a
big
citrusy
grapefruit
hop
note
with
a
bit
of
grassiness
the
taste
starts
with
some
sweet
apricot
that
gives
way
to
the
grapefruit
flavor
thats
got
more
than
a
bit
of
the
rind
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
overall
an
interesting
next
step
from
a

im

really
like
this
style
and
i
think
this
is
a
great
example
of
it
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
this
one
again
lagunitas
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
this
beautiful
belgian
pale
pours
an
orangecopper
almost
like
a
pumpkin
beer
with
a
sizeable
head
with
excellent
lacing
slight
booze
odor
given
off
beneath
the
floral
hop
and
sweet
bready
aromas
with
a
ripe
something
on
the
very
back
end
the
taste
is
sweet
and
in
the
front
and
bitter
towards
the
back
with
ever
so
slight
peppery
phenols
around
dangerously
drinkable
like
most
of
the
breweries
beers
excellent
stuff
a
good
what
i
would
style
as
american
dipa
overall
a
good
beer
could
tone
down
the
yeast
a
bit
this
ale
whether
you
consider
it
a
belgium
strong
pale
ale
or
an
imperial
ipa
has
everything
you
would
want
in
an
west
coast
american
pale
ale
despite
the
high
abv
94
each
flavor
is
balanced
almost
to
perfection
a
great
spin
on
an
already
great
beer
i
blew
through
a
case
of
this
faster
than
i
wanted
to
woo
hoo
another
one
that
i
truly
love
overall
drinkability
as
with
many
things
from
this
brewery
good
amounts
of
hops
and
malt
very
tasty
and
it
did
not
disappoint
but
it
doesnt
make
me
think
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
the
alcohol
is
perfectly
hidden
which
can
be
a
characteristic
of
this
beer
but
its
a
dipa
in
flavor
im
not
complaining
exactly
as
it
is
quite
tasty
but
im
not
seeing
the
connection
to
the
style
at
all
however
ill
give
it
this
just
like
duvel
which
will
sneak
up
on
you
this
one
will
too
high
abv
so
well
hidden
yep
devilish
is
one
way
to
describe
this
but
tasty
enough
that
i
want
another
one
so
maybe
it
is
this
style
after
all
just
hop
forward
in
fine
westcoast
style
quite
drinkable
despite
the
fact
the
even
with
the
devil
egging
me
on
i
should
stop
at
one
this
is
a
solid
beer
complex
intriguing
warming
refreshing
all
around
good
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
just
makes
style
boundaries
seem
silly
it
has
a
bunch
of
different
things
going
on
heavy
hops
belgian
yeast
fruity
sweet
malts
so
what
is
it
delicious
clear
as
a
bell
straworangy
color
off
white
head
with
not
the
greatest
head
retention
smells
mostly
like
floralfruity
belgian
yeast
with
a
touch
of
booze
yeast
seems
to
mixcover
hop
smell
a
bit
hop
aroma
that
i
can
detect
is
citruspiney
and
very
american
smelling
tastes
very
a
lot
like
centennial
hops
in
the
flavor
reasonable
malty
sweetness
to
back
up
the
booze
and
bitterness
slight
bread
malt
notes
as
well
westmalle
yeast
is
great
tasting
very
clean
but
the
bitterness
hits
at
the
same
time
and
really
conflicts
in
my
opinion
i
do
like
the
idea
of
american
hops
mixed
with
the
traditional
belgian
abbey
yeast
other
than
the
high
bitterness
this
beer
has
no
notable
flaws
in
my
opinion
well
crafted
and
fun
to
drink
solid
alcohol
content
in
this
one
so
some
aging
might
bring
out
the
yeast
and
subdue
the
bitterness
a
bit
ill
try
aging
and
rereviewing
in
a
year
or
two
a
delicious
belgian
dipa
if
you
ask
me
overall
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
beers
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
like
i
said
earlier
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
tried
from
laguintas
and
i
have
had
tons
of
their
beers
if
you
see
this
beer
but
it
o
its
different
its
not
what
i
expected
but
it
has
that
definite
wild
type
of
taste
to
it
its
more
on
the
side
of
the
pale
ale
spectrum
with
that
slight
difference
o
this
is
a
high
abv
beer
done
right
crisp
clean
and
bold
my
favorite
of
a
top
notch
lagunitas
line
of
brews
not
a
big
fan
of
wild
farmhouse
style
but
this
is
a
nice
surprise
o
i
like
lagunitas
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
a
joy
to
drink
wild
is
a
seriously
fun
big
rollicking
inyourface
americaneuro
ipa
thank
you
lagunitas
keep
doing
waht
youre
doing
overall
pretty
tasty
and
flavorful
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
saison
then
anything
the
bitterness
at
the
end
is
my
only
downfall
a
nice
addition
to
the
sumpin
series
a
nice
offering
from
lagunitas
sort
of
a
mellow
mix
between
a
belgian
ipa
and
a
saison
well
its
perfectly
natural
to
compare
this
with
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
but
lets
just
say
they
are
both
excellent
on
their
own
merits
this
definitely
has
a
belgium
slant
to
it
an
americanized
saison
and
for
that
reason
i
find
this
ale
to
be
just
delicious
overall
everything
comes
together
in
this
ale
the
yeast
the
malt
the
hops
and
even
the
sweetness
to
deliver
an
excellent
balanced
ale
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
for
me
despite
the
virtually
unnoticeable
9
4
abv
an
ale
i
can
drink
several
of
back
to
back
this
is
one
of
the
few
brews
i
enjoyed
slightly
colder
seems
perfect
at
around
50
degrees
lagunitas
continues
to
impress
me
o
i
liked
this
for
it
hoppiness
but
i
didnt
find
much
belgian
character
other
reviewers
mentioned
brett
i
certainly
didnt
find
any
of
that
o
im
glad
to
see
this
in
6
packs
this
year
my
favorite
under
the
radar
beer
at
an
event
last
year
glad
im
enjoying
it
as
much
this
time
around
solid
brew
from
lagunitas
amongst
my
favorites
from
them
i
did
not
enjoy
this
one
on
tap
nearly
as
much
this
is
definitely
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
lagunitas
ive
had
some
belgian
strong
pale
ales
before
but
this
one
blows
all
of
them
out
of
the
water
including
the
almighty
duvel
finely
crafted
and
devastatingly
tasty
this
is
a
beer
that
merits
repeat
visits
in
the
future
bravo
lagunitas
o
once
again
lagunitas
does
not
disappoint
a
very
enjoyable
seasonal
o
very
pleasing
brew
the
flavours
are
great
as
is
the
aroma
the
alcohol
shines
through
a
tad
to
much
and
it
could
lessen
the
bitterness
overall
a
very
smooth
enjoyable
flavorful
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
o
a
good
beer
much
better
on
the
flavor
than
on
the
aroma
though
this
one
had
me
scratching
my
head
i
could
swear
that
the
server
poured
me
a
dipa
later
that
afternoon
i
had
the
bartender
draw
me
a
sample
and
sure
enough
its
what
i
had
earlier
maybe
i
was
expecting
a
wild
ale
and
the
name
was
misleading
as
there
were
no
sour
characteristics
present
in
the
beer
appearance
was
golden
with
a
bit
of
amber
and
slightly
cloudy
head
was
a
bit
on
the
short
lived
side
and
there
was
little
lace
aroma
was
strong
chops
grapefruit
and
tropical
fruit
flavor
was
the
same
medium
body
and
carbonation
i
would
have
rated
this
beer
a
half
higher
overall
if
it
were
billed
as
a
dipa
as
the
hops
were
too
overwhelming
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangegold
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
rotten
grapefruit
rotten
oranges
and
pine
it
is
not
an
appealing
aroma
the
taste
is
hoppy
with
the
same
rotten
quality
of
the
aroma
i
cant
detect
anything
remotely
wildsour
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bad
beer
if
this
truly
is
a
wild
ale
then
it
is
way
too
hoppy
to
let
the
wild
ale
qualities
come
through
as
is
it
tastes
like
a
poorly
crafted
dipa
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
again
a
really
tasty
and
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
bspa
not
quite
as
carbonated
or
fluffy
as
some
but
a
very
nice
americanized
hoppy
version
nonetheless
could
easily
be
categorized
as
a
belgian
ipa
i
didnt
know
the
style
they
were
going
for
at
first
which
i
guess
should
be
blamed
on
marketing
the
original
sumpin
advertised
the
wheat
but
that
doesnt
jibe
well
with
most
belgian
strong
pales
i
didnt
know
what
to
think
of
this
beer
it
would
have
been
better
without
the
strong
carbonation
and
bite
in
the
tongue
i
guess
i
could
just
let
it
simmer
a
bit
after
pouring
if
i
buy
a
sixer
though
this
is
interesting
if
not
complex
lagunitas
keeps
proving
to
me
that
they
are
a
bit
one
note
and
should
stick
to
their
awesome
ipas
the
hops
are
pretty
prominent
in
the
taste
bready
malts
some
tropical
fruit
herbs
apple
and
berries
citrus
just
a
touch
of
spicy
alcohol
which
is
well
blended
fairly
yeasty
and
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
transparent
orange
in
body
with
bubbly
white
smells
of
grassy
hops
sweet
malt
and
some
wild
yeast
tastes
of
grassy
hops
wild
yeast
apples
and
vague
alcohol
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
tasty
drink
with
great
flavor
and
quite
sessionable
for
its
abv
ho
yeah
try
it
an
interesting
beer
but
i
think
the
wild
distracts
rather
than
adds
to
the
base
beer
great
beer
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
really
liked
it
overall
its
good
but
the
hops
dominate
everything
else
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
another
sixpack
or
so
while
it
is
around
i
like
that
the
american
breweries
are
experimenting
with
hops
in
sour
beers
and
i
think
that
it
is
a
good
direction
to
go
i
am
also
liking
the
black
ipa
so
some
exciting
things
are
ahead
the
fact
that
i
plan
to
buy
this
beer
again
says
that
i
approve
go
get
yourself
some
and
give
it
a
shot
if
you
like
ipa
andor
sour
beers
you
probably
wont
be
disappointed
i
would
like
it
to
be
more
bold
on
the
wild
side
but
this
is
still
ok
overall
im
going
to
say
it
i
like
this
more
than
the
original
and
that
is
saying
something
its
an
imperial
wheat
wild
ipa
and
it
straightup
kicks
ass
great
original
beer
thats
loaded
with
complexity
and
flavour
i
had
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
and
really
enjoyed
that
beer
this
one
was
not
far
from
it
brisk
carbonation
and
even
slightly
tannic
o
i
will
keep
buying
this
well
priced
and
wonderfully
drinkable
at
9
4
abv
i
would
only
be
able
to
drink
around
10
to
12
bottles
before
switching
over
to
something
lighter
this
is
a
rare
beer
where
everything
flavor
style
value
availability
came
together
perfectly
cant
recommend
this
highly
enough
o
a
unique
and
deservedly
awesome
beer
everything
about
it
screams
quality
complexity
and
uniqueness
i
love
this
style
and
ive
truly
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
one
goes
up
to
the
top
of
my
list
of
best
bspas
out
there
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
thought
it
was
very
well
put
together
and
as
i
moved
through
the
glass
i
found
myself
appreciating
it
more
and
more
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
brews
so
i
may
have
to
seek
this
one
out
to
mix
it
up
every
now
and
then
o
this
is
a
unique
blegoamerican
ale
that
is
both
easy
drinking
maybe
too
easy
drinking
for
its
abv
and
exceptionally
flavorful
theres
nothing
really
wild
about
this
but
rather
just
a
hopped
up
version
of
a
bspa
all
the
spiciness
and
yeast
associated
with
the
style
just
some
added
american
flair
and
a
lot
more
hops
your
typical
lagunitas
offering
very
solid
beer
nice
hop
profile
with
a
little
twist
nice
alcohol
kick
i
cant
say
ive
every
had
a
bad
brew
from
these
guys
o
this
is
a
brilliant
beer
that
i
am
so
happy
i
got
a
six
pack
of
on
a
whim
i
will
be
getting
this
again
and
find
it
suitable
if
not
better
then
some
of
the
good
abbey
beers
brilliant
edit
my
bottle
is
telling
me
its
9
4
rather
than
the
8
85
that
is
listed
shibby
good
stuff
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
o
really
great
9
but
you
can
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
could
drink
many
of
these
i
often
feel
lagunitas
misses
the
mark
and
is
only
about
the
spectacle
but
theyve
proven
me
wrong
big
time
here
highly
recommended
this
is
another
high
quality
beverage
from
the
folks
at
lagunitas
theyve
really
done
a
nice
job
with
this
beer
it
looks
good
smells
good
taste
good
feels
good
it
must
be
good
while
an
excellent
beer
this
is
nothing
like
what
i
think
of
when
i
envision
a
belgian
stong
pale
ale
far
hoppier
than
any
bspa
ive
had
before
this
does
have
the
lagunitas
house
brand
clearly
stamped
on
it
with
its
aggressive
hop
presence
sweet
to
start
peppery
and
bitter
to
finish
this
is
a
relatively
complex
brew
that
i
definitely
recommend
grabbing
and
trying
cheers
o
leaning
more
toward
ipa
territory
another
example
of
a
tasty
but
if
predictably
hoppy
lagunitas
beer
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
great
i
will
definitely
seek
out
again
very
nice
beer
a
great
mix
of
different
flavors
making
a
fun
complex
beer
o
a
very
delicious
brew
worthy
of
its
namesake
i
only
wish
it
wasnt
limited
release
overall
this
one
is
occasionally
available
in
utah
i
wish
we
could
get
it
regularly
a
very
well
done
solid
complex
beer
maybe
my
only
knock
is
that
it
would
not
be
accessible
to
a
person
new
to
craft
beer
this
is
a
beer
lovers
beer
o
delightful
i
was
super
glad
i
picked
this
up
easily
the
best
overall
drinking
pint
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
will
be
sad
when
the
sixer
is
done
d
a
really
really
nice
brew
a
little
more
in
the
aroma
department
would
make
this
an
exceptional
offering
well
crafted
and
rather
unique
i
would
gladly
invest
in
a
sixer
of
this
every
time
i
see
it
and
would
recommend
other
bas
do
the
same
lagunitas
has
never
let
me
down
all
that
being
said
im
not
sure
i
agree
with
the
style
classification
for
this
one
it
strikes
me
much
more
as
a
double
ipa
or
strong
ale
overall
this
beer
met
expectations
it
was
unique
and
likable
but
im
not
sure
thats
enough
for
me
to
want
to
buy
it
regularly
its
interesting
to
experiment
making
a
malty
belgian
beer
and
lots
of
hops
but
a
heavy
handed
dose
of
american
hoppiness
shouldnt
go
to
waste
thats
why
the
parent
beer
to
this
little
sumppin
sumpin
is
more
of
a
success
focus
on
the
hops
thats
why
i
say
this
is
just
worth
a
try
overall
what
an
interesting
beer
so
many
flavors
and
nuances
i
have
really
liked
every
lagunitas
product
ive
tried
and
this
is
certainly
no
exception
i
totally
get
the
wild
with
all
of
the
flavors
going
here
along
with
a
prominent
carmel
backbone
that
offsets
the
bitter
nuances
this
one
is
just
spiced
check
this
one
out
i
would
buy
this
one
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
is
a
big
sister
to
a
beer
i
still
havent
tried
so
i
dont
quite
have
a
comparison
there
its
just
a
great
beer
lagunitas
continues
to
show
great
range
and
quality
mouthfeel
good
crisp
body
and
feel
works
well
with
the
taste
o
definitely
not
a
bspatoo
thick
and
hoppybut
a
wonderful
belgian
ipa
a
delicious
mix
of
sweet
and
spicy
belgian
aromasflavors
with
tropical
fruit
hop
aromas
and
flavors
i
didnt
expect
to
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
i
do
but
its
hard
not
to
chug
it
because
its
so
tasty
and
drinkable
absolutely
love
it
future
outlook
at
under
10
for
a
sixer
this
was
an
incredible
steal
might
have
to
be
used
as
cellarstock
o
over
all
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
belgium
style
beers
i
have
hadliked
i
dont
like
the
belgium
styles
much
more
of
a
hophead
this
has
the
best
of
both
worlds
for
belgium
ipa
fans
hops
and
a
belgium
back
ground
bottle
indicates
a
alc
of
9
4
instead
of
8
8
stated
here
o
i
had
this
on
tap
once
and
thought
it
was
overly
sweet
while
there
is
some
sweetness
the
bitter
grapefruit
definitely
wins
out
overall
a
nice
belgian
ipa
that
would
have
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
final
thoughts
nothing
great
i
guess
im
comparing
it
too
much
to
sumpin
sumpin
but
looking
at
it
from
beligian
stand
point
i
think
its
pretty
normal
its
good
but
i
kinda
expected
more
otruly
a
wonderful
flavorful
beer
laguanitas
has
been
really
impressing
me
lately
and
this
might
be
my
favorite
so
far
i
can
drink
this
beer
everyday
highly
recommended
very
bitter
of
course
grapefruit
rind
comes
to
mind
as
big
waves
of
citrus
and
pine
combine
in
the
taste
thick
mouthfeel
but
crisp
and
dry
as
well
sweetness
is
brief
but
there
in
an
attempt
to
balance
some
of
the
bitterness
quite
unsuccessfully
but
that
might
be
a
good
thing
for
me
and
other
hop
heads
malted
barley
flavors
help
a
little
to
bring
this
down
to
earth
boozy
notes
come
through
as
it
warms
a
little
but
it
doesnt
take
anything
away
from
the
overall
flavor
what
this
beer
lacks
in
balance
it
makes
up
for
in
its
inyourface
hoppy
quality
another
really
good
hop
bomb
from
lagunitas
and
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
i
though
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
after
everything
is
all
said
and
done
i
think
i
like
this
slight
more
then
the
original
beer
i
find
that
the
combination
of
the
belgian
yeast
with
the
base
of
this
beer
really
work
well
together
and
help
take
this
brew
to
another
level
i
also
like
the
heavier
amount
of
citrus
hops
that
show
up
in
the
beer
it
makes
for
a
really
nice
mixture
of
different
citrus
fruits
i
like
the
flavor
and
aroma
the
most
about
this
beer
everything
seemed
to
come
together
very
nicely
and
with
great
balance
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
the
color
was
a
little
pale
and
head
and
head
retention
was
lack
luster
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
and
the
flavor
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
if
i
had
another
one
i
would
drink
it
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
again
i
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
if
you
like
belgian
ipas
this
beer
would
be
a
great
choice
lagunitas
has
been
impressing
me
a
lot
lately
every
beer
i
have
had
from
them
has
been
good
and
impressing
they
are
making
a
nice
run
at
being
my
favorite
out
of
state
brewery
they
sure
now
how
to
use
their
hops
you
guys
keep
making
different
variations
of
this
beer
and
i
will
keep
drinking
them
this
pours
a
clear
orangish
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
with
good
lacing
the
smell
is
of
citrus
grapefruit
and
orange
some
yeast
funk
and
spices
very
good
and
sweet
smelling
feel
is
medium
with
a
mouth
coating
hop
resin
the
taste
is
pretty
exceptional
i
do
get
the
alcohol
boozeiness
taste
but
there
is
a
good
amount
of
grapefruit
hop
bite
some
nice
belgium
yeast
esters
funk
and
a
load
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
overall
this
is
an
amazing
brew
i
like
it
more
than
the
great
little
sumpin
regular
this
is
my
second
favorite
lagunitas
brew
only
after
the
even
better
hop
stoopid
o
i
actually
really
liked
this
one
its
another
winner
for
laguniatas
with
me
o
i
am
a
big
fan
of
lagunitas
and
the
beers
they
produce
this
may
be
my
favorite
d
off
the
charts
amazing
this
is
a
solid
solid
beer
first
time
ive
ever
seen
this
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
a
beer
that
outofreach
beer
drinkers
should
be
willing
to
trade
for
this
shit
is
awesome
reading
the
other
reviews
it
may
be
possible
that
earlier
versions
of
this
beer
were
different
it
also
may
be
possible
that
i
got
an
earlier
version
of
this
since
the
lagunitas
site
says
that
the
2011
version
of
this
is
8
85
so
im
really
not
sure
poured
into
a
snifter
this
one
pours
brilliantly
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
moderate
bright
white
head
that
leaves
nice
amounts
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mediumhigh
fruity
esters
lots
of
pineapple
some
citrus
hints
of
bready
malt
inviting
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
hoppy
upfront
citrus
hops
chewy
bready
malt
the
beer
swallows
velvety
smooth
dries
a
good
deal
and
a
solid
hop
bitterness
emerges
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
just
a
bit
with
a
bit
of
phenolic
yeast
character
also
noticeable
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
carbonation
moderate
overall
a
tremendous
beer
complex
yet
easy
to
drink
very
glad
i
got
a
full
6
pack
probably
should
get
another
o
excellent
beer
i
prefer
the
sumpin
to
the
sumpin
wild
but
still
a
solid
beer
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
its
taste
profile
one
of
the
better
hoppy
beers
with
belgian
yeast
i
have
had
would
buy
and
enjoy
again
o
solid
offering
from
lagunitas
extremely
drinkable
considering
the
abv
i
recommend
trying
this
at
least
once
o
while
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
wasnt
wild
enough
for
me
i
would
have
liked
it
better
if
the
funk
was
stronger
but
still
a
good
beer
thats
worth
trying
d
very
easy
to
drink
complex
blend
of
hops
and
malt
really
work
well
to
create
a
pleasant
palate
experience
i
would
have
another
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
short
of
awesome
i
was
pleasantly
blown
away
actually
by
how
good
it
was
excellent
all
around
beer
with
very
high
drinkability
i
didnt
realize
that
it
was
fermented
with
westmalle
yeast
which
makes
sense
because
i
love
westmalle
and
think
its
incredibly
complex
which
lends
itself
perfectly
to
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
i
remember
this
beer
tasting
a
bit
different
when
it
was
in
22oz
bombers
i
think
i
enjoy
this
beer
even
more
now
that
i
get
6
of
them
light
golden
with
a
big
pillowy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
like
cream
soda
with
belgian
spice
and
plenty
of
minty
piney
hops
delicious
and
hoppy
with
toasted
barley
and
coriander
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
bottle
is
actually
labeled
9
4
abv
finishes
dry
nice
heft
but
light
enough
and
effervescent
a
nice
tasty
belgian
style
ipa
but
not
really
a
wild
ale
the
beer
is
transparent
and
golden
hued
with
14
of
white
head
it
seems
like
lately
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of
beers
that
look
like
this
the
aroma
brings
some
dank
hops
alcohol
and
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
decent
albeit
a
bit
sharp
thin
to
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
present
alcohol
presence
im
not
as
impressed
as
the
large
majority
with
this
brew
a
valiant
effort
but
i
would
take
ubiquitous
duvel
over
this
any
time
o
pretty
good
drinkability
considering
the
abv
and
the
belgium
yeast
pretty
good
overall
o
overall
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
given
the
abv
however
i
really
think
it
could
have
some
more
belgian
qualities
seeing
that
it
is
a
bspa
all
in
all
a
decent
offering
but
nothing
i
would
hunt
down
3
5
o
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
change
of
scenery
from
all
of
the
summer
beers
that
have
been
in
my
rotation
lately
that
being
said
i
think
i
prefer
sumpin
sumpin
over
this
not
a
knock
against
sumpin
wild
just
my
preference
really
enjoyed
the
belgian
yeast
and
mystery
mild
funk
also
was
kind
of
refreshing
with
the
clovey
weizenlike
notes
in
the
taste
i
will
enjoy
the
few
remaining
bottles
from
the
sixer
on
the
porch
looking
out
at
the
ocean
o
well
this
has
that
lagunitas
taste
to
it
without
a
doubt
i
still
feel
like
the
odd
guy
out
since
i
dont
find
it
to
be
a
huge
draw
i
just
dont
see
their
beers
to
be
very
unique
from
one
another
this
has
enough
hops
to
scratch
your
itch
and
some
awesome
yeast
strain
in
it
but
the
flavors
arent
doing
it
for
me
awesome
stuff
here
and
sessionable
o
quite
good
i
wouldnt
really
categorize
this
as
a
bpa
at
least
a
typical
one
this
is
basically
a
stronger
lil
sumpin
sumpin
with
the
added
complexity
of
some
belgian
yeast
overall
impression
a
nice
brew
by
lagunitas
not
as
spicy
or
sour
as
i
thought
it
would
be
very
drinkable
fruity
and
has
the
perfect
balance
all
around
one
of
the
coolest
attributes
of
this
beer
is
that
the
aroma
was
very
similar
to
the
flavortaste
cool
recommend
grabbing
if
you
like
light
belgians
o
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
glad
i
have
another
o
you
can
almost
taste
the
dirt
that
each
element
of
this
brew
was
grown
in
such
a
brilliant
balance
of
hops
malted
barley
yeast
and
water
citrus
flavors
that
spank
you
sweet
malts
that
draw
you
in
and
yeasty
funk
that
makes
you
say
what
the
funk
damn
near
perfect
o
i
believe
that
each
and
every
one
of
the
72
51
ibus
that
lagunitas
claims
is
present
highly
bitter
brew
with
citrus
notes
and
a
nice
blanket
of
funk
the
only
drawback
is
that
the
malts
or
lack
thereof
create
an
unpleasant
graininess
as
a
backbone
the
high
ibus
hide
the
9
4
abv
nicely
o
this
is
by
far
in
my
top
five
beers
of
all
time
it
is
the
nectar
of
the
gods
excellent
beer
from
lagunitas
o
really
surpassed
w
this
one
really
reminds
me
of
a
midwest
ipa
more
than
anything
cant
say
that
the
belgian
yeast
comes
through
all
that
strain
but
that
not
a
knock
on
this
beer
very
very
good
this
beer
pours
a
crisp
gold
with
a
fluffy
head
it
smells
sweet
malty
and
alcoholic
this
beer
tastes
unique
it
is
sweet
crisp
lemon
i
was
hesitant
to
try
this
as
lagunitas
offerings
have
struck
me
as
being
too
similar
to
each
other
in
the
past
this
one
is
different
and
very
tasty
ooverall
it
was
an
excellent
beer
its
heavy
to
be
a
regular
drinker
though
o
good
brew
glad
i
picked
up
a
sixer
final
thought
pick
some
up
for
sure
lagunitas
always
knows
how
to
brew
a
great
seasonal
and
a
great
price
8
99
a
six
overall
again
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
brews
just
does
what
it
does
so
well
im
glad
i
still
have
pretty
much
half
a
case
left
o
when
i
tried
this
beer
last
year
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
i
had
tried
all
year
this
year
im
glad
to
see
it
in
the
new
12oz
format
making
it
a
bit
easier
to
enjoy
this
is
a
masterfully
crafted
beer
and
im
not
even
sure
the
belgians
could
get
as
good
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
behind
the
funkiness
of
the
yeast
as
well
as
the
huge
hop
aromas
if
anyone
from
lagunitas
is
reading
this
please
make
this
an
unlimited
release
overall
solid
beer
will
buy
again
for
sure
o
a
good
beer
i
cant
believe
i
had
a
lagunitas
beer
that
i
didnt
say
was
great
alochol
is
a
little
overpowering
for
my
taste
ill
throw
the
rest
in
the
cellar
to
age
a
little
and
see
if
it
blends
better
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
more
i
felt
like
the
main
thing
detracting
from
me
giving
a
higher
score
is
that
the
bitterness
seemed
to
not
mesh
so
well
and
not
as
well
balanced
out
by
the
malt
as
i
would
have
liked
it
was
a
solid
beer
though
and
i
would
enjoy
this
again
without
hesitation
overall
a
surprise
to
see
cases
of
this
stacked
up
i
may
buy
the
remaining
stock
overall
its
pretty
allright
i
guess
its
vaguely
more
belgian
than
the
standard
and
its
interesting
to
see
a
new
take
on
a
commonplace
standard
o
delicious
light
beer
great
for
a
late
summer
release
overall
this
beer
is
phenomenal
the
bitterness
and
pungent
aromas
hide
the
abv
well
and
the
mouthfeel
matches
up
very
well
with
similar
iipas
heres
to
hoping
this
sees
the
same
unlimited
production
as
the
original
sumpin
sumpin
this
beer
is
not
nearly
as
wild
as
i
had
expected
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
very
pleased
it
was
not
the
closer
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
more
i
dug
the
subtle
funky
characteristics
of
the
beer
and
enjoyed
how
well
it
played
off
of
the
characteristics
of
this
already
excellent
recipe
definitely
recommended
i
like
this
a
lot
more
than
the
regular
sumpin
sumpin
like
a
lot
of
the
lagunitas
seasonals
its
hard
to
drink
lots
of
it
because
they
are
damned
high
in
abv
o
i
love
the
regular
version
of
this
beer
and
the
wild
version
is
pretty
damn
tasty
as
well
i
had
this
in
bomber
format
last
time
and
im
glad
they
decided
to
release
this
in
six
packs
this
time
o
nice
representation
of
the
style
taste
is
a
bit
strong
and
maltiness
in
the
finish
is
a
bit
off
light
wheat
color
beer
with
nice
carbination
and
a
very
large
white
head
on
an
agressive
pour
both
looking
and
smelling
like
a
light
belgian
a
hint
of
citrus
on
the
nose
orange
smooth
going
down
even
better
as
it
warms
a
little
i
am
not
tasting
the
dark
fruits
but
i
taste
banana
and
biscuit
it
goes
down
easily
for
a
9
4
avb
beer
the
2011
vintage
denotes
9
4
abv
on
the
label
a
must
try
for
the
style
but
nothing
im
going
to
suggest
you
need
an
additional
6pack
of
however
for
the
abv
and
the
9
99
price
tag
on
a
good
beer
its
a
great
buy
another
homerun
by
lagunitas
a
tasty
inexpensive
alcoholfilled
treat
picked
up
a
single
to
try
this
is
a
nice
mix
of
ipa
and
belgian
styles
as
both
make
a
big
impression
on
the
taste
buds
i
wish
my
pallette
was
more
discerning
so
i
could
describe
the
flavors
better
good
stuff
d
very
enjoyable
nice
mix
of
malts
and
hops
the
sweetness
could
be
a
bit
overwhelming
after
a
glass
but
its
still
very
enjoyalbe
a
heavy
beer
i
thought
best
had
at
a
later
dinner
pours
orange
tinged
body
with
a
little
retained
white
head
mildly
hoppy
aroma
big
mouthfeel
initial
glasses
of
it
demonstrated
the
yeast
followed
by
the
hops
and
finished
by
a
lot
of
malts
the
third
glass
was
mostly
malt
and
just
a
variation
of
a
double
ipa
stong
american
ale
still
good
drinkability
but
would
like
to
have
enjoyed
more
of
the
yeast
and
all
the
complexity
it
promises
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
quick
fading
head
that
leaves
nothing
behind
nose
is
somewhat
subtle
but
some
nice
funk
with
malts
and
a
slight
hop
presence
taste
is
decent
not
quite
as
in
your
face
as
some
american
wilds
but
still
tasty
some
sour
funk
finishes
the
palate
with
breads
and
bananas
up
front
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
from
the
tap
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
more
sessionable
that
some
of
the
other
wild
ales
not
overly
sour
but
nice
complexity
truly
an
amazing
beer
it
seems
they
raised
the
abv
a
tad
from
last
year
but
just
as
tasty
maybe
even
better
dank
get
some
o
these
belgohop
bombs
can
be
hit
or
miss
but
lagunitas
knocked
one
out
of
the
park
with
this
beer
perfect
melding
of
flavors
into
a
delicious
brew
bought
just
a
single
thinking
that
i
didnt
want
more
of
a
nearly
9
beer
around
at
this
time
of
year
but
im
heading
back
to
the
bottle
shop
tomorrow
to
pick
up
a
6er
this
is
a
must
try
cheers
jd
finally
why
is
this
not
categorized
as
a
belgian
ipa
cheers
notes
this
is
classic
all
hop
ipa
im
a
fan
and
it
really
is
a
solid
contribution
to
lagunitas
incredible
line
well
done
o
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
best
one
ive
had
by
lagunitas
has
a
lot
of
good
stuff
going
on
and
i
would
drink
this
again
o
lagunitas
little
sumpin
wild
was
a
reasonable
little
beer
not
spectacular
in
any
way
though
it
managed
to
hold
my
attention
long
enough
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
but
would
quaff
one
in
a
pinch
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
belgian
dipa
than
a
belgian
strong
pale
but
ill
take
it
there
is
a
noticeable
difference
from
last
years
fresh
bottles
and
its
a
bigger
lean
toward
the
belgian
side
with
american
traits
of
course
ill
grab
some
more
soon
hopefully
a
few
22oz
for
the
cellar
though
not
for
too
long
oim
impressed
but
it
isnt
the
wild
ale
i
expected
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
probably
prefer
the
more
flowery
yeast
and
citrus
of
regular
little
sumpin
sumpin
one
of
my
favorites
given
the
ibus
and
high
abv
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
a
couple
in
one
sitting
cheers
its
a
bit
hot
while
not
filmy
or
overly
sweet
the
hops
dont
provide
the
snap
i
was
looking
for
still
this
is
a
nice
beer
can
very
well
pair
with
cheeses
and
come
out
a
winner
i
normally
wouldnt
review
an
old
dipa
but
considering
its
called
a
bspa
which
should
be
fairly
cellarable
and
they
dont
date
the
bottles
im
throwing
this
review
up
if
you
want
to
make
sure
i
drink
your
product
as
intended
date
the
damned
bottle
and
categorize
it
better
o
im
another
sucker
who
got
fooled
into
thinking
this
was
a
wild
ale
i
was
left
impressed
though
and
i
have
yet
to
have
a
lagunitas
brew
that
has
let
me
down
really
good
stuff
very
interesting
beer
shades
of
the
original
lss
with
hints
of
saison
and
more
herbal
hop
than
either
o
this
would
be
a
better
beer
to
drink
in
the
new
england
winter
i
would
get
another
bottle
and
drink
it
with
snow
on
the
ground
after
a
graceful
aging
period
the
beer
would
shine
in
such
conditions
even
as
it
is
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
sits
very
well
mf
ok
carbonation
coats
the
palate
but
could
be
a
tad
more
crisp
with
a
little
more
body
d
very
easy
to
drink
not
taxing
and
hides
abv
well
not
to
be
trifled
with
a
powerful
beer
with
a
load
of
flavors
one
of
my
favorites
from
lagunitas
o
this
beer
was
just
too
sweet
and
one
dimensional
for
me
it
reminded
me
of
a
much
less
hopped
hop
stoopid
that
i
had
on
tap
right
before
this
drinkability
a
very
good
american
interpretation
of
a
bspa
lots
of
flavor
and
a
great
belgian
yeast
profile
its
a
relatively
high
9
abv
but
no
strong
alcohol
taste
at
all
a
very
easy
drinking
bspa
and
easy
to
session
with
a
big
bottle
or
two
another
winner
from
lagunitas
the
flavor
has
a
good
fruity
yeast
and
hop
cohesion
which
gives
the
hoppy
citrus
and
light
tropical
flavor
with
spice
from
the
yeast
a
lot
of
room
to
expand
and
cover
the
palate
with
an
array
of
juicy
and
peppery
notes
the
yeast
adds
elements
of
melon
while
there
is
a
rindlike
taste
from
the
hops
and
moderate
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
with
mild
caramel
malt
which
gives
a
light
sweetness
to
the
flavor
but
comes
forward
slightly
as
it
wams
with
a
gentle
toasted
character
overall
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
hops
and
belgian
yeast
together
this
strain
is
nice
to
combine
with
west
coast
hops
and
lagunitas
did
a
good
job
incorporating
in
a
pleasant
way
i
think
this
is
drinkable
especially
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
brew
you
barely
taste
it
a
solid
offering
taste
packs
a
powerful
citrus
punch
up
front
sweet
orange
dominated
by
bitter
grapefruit
followed
by
buttery
bread
notes
and
a
chewy
malt
mouthfeel
there
is
a
taste
of
raw
honey
in
there
as
well
an
excellent
beer
that
is
big
on
flavor
and
deceptively
strong
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mystery
sweetness
in
many
aspects
this
was
quite
a
unique
beer
especially
for
the
style
they
threw
plenty
of
hops
in
and
gave
it
a
proper
belgian
yeasting
while
leaving
it
nice
and
strong
and
boozy
the
very
finish
of
the
taste
is
wonderfully
refreshing
with
a
delicate
flowery
sweetness
that
is
otherwise
hard
to
replicate
in
taste
the
aroma
was
very
solid
nice
light
fruit
notes
with
a
very
well
hidden
brett
profile
light
grains
and
a
touch
of
a
fresh
grass
like
hoppiness
sneaking
in
as
it
warmed
up
light
and
delicate
flavor
with
a
crispness
that
was
very
nice
clean
with
little
in
the
way
of
funk
showing
up
here
light
grains
and
some
peach
and
pearapple
notes
that
were
followed
up
nicely
with
the
slightest
amount
of
sour
flavor
just
enough
to
let
you
know
it
was
there
smooth
and
mellow
with
a
light
feel
that
was
well
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
its
friday
night
and
had
to
already
endure
a
hockey
game
and
birthday
party
its
time
for
some
me
time
cracked
a
lagunitas
little
sumpin
wild
and
its
pretty
decent
the
color
is
unfiltered
and
golden
massive
floaties
in
this
beer
which
i
dont
necessary
like
i
think
it
gives
me
gas
the
awesome
whites
head
laced
beautifully
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
citrus
to
it
but
not
over
bearing
the
taste
is
tart
and
heavier
on
the
grapefruity
doesnt
come
off
the
pallete
right
away
lingers
somewhat
the
mouthefeel
is
ok
the
higer
abv
would
make
it
tough
to
do
an
allnighter
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
full
and
rich
but
extremely
well
balanced
really
nice
hop
profile
alongside
the
other
flavors
mixed
in
the
8
85
abv
is
also
pretty
much
completely
hidden
here
flavour
is
malty
sweet
with
dark
fruit
but
perfectly
balanced
by
the
refreshing
hops
leaves
a
pleasing
yeasty
aftertaste
and
lingering
silky
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
not
a
noticeable
presence
even
though
this
beer
is
over
8
abv
a
very
unique
excellent
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
i
prefer
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
but
i
would
recommend
this
and
would
drink
it
again
o
great
beer
honestly
i
thought
this
was
a
dipa
at
times
and
not
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
very
drinkable
looking
forward
for
this
coming
out
again
excellent
hoppy
and
complex
so
many
different
tastes
i
like
the
price
too
a
good
beer
i
can
purchase
again
pours
a
beautiful
clear
bright
gold
with
a
substantial
head
smells
of
yeasty
bananas
some
summer
wheat
a
bit
of
orange
spice
tastes
much
more
of
hops
than
i
would
have
expected
wow
not
in
the
scent
mellowed
hops
in
the
front
some
bread
like
qualities
on
the
backend
mouthfeel
is
bait
on
the
dry
side
not
bad
overall
nice
beer
but
did
not
wow
me
poured
into
a
snifter
this
beer
is
goldenamber
a
bit
cloudy
with
a
12
white
head
smells
very
bready
citrus
vanilla
yogurt
juicy
hops
and
a
sun
tan
lotion
smell
i
get
from
belgianbelgian
style
beers
not
a
bad
thing
the
taste
is
spot
on
from
the
nose
mildly
sour
sweet
bready
vanilla
and
citrus
and
such
juicy
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
with
a
dry
finish
and
mild
carbonation
overall
a
real
treat
as
with
almost
everything
from
lagunitas
highly
recommended
overall
a
great
interpretation
of
this
style
i
would
call
it
a
tripel
ipa
more
than
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
though
mf
medium
to
heavy
bodied
this
one
is
not
that
strong
in
body
yet
huge
in
flavors
well
carbonated
but
primarily
unpleasant
o
if
only
i
had
more
of
this
in
my
fridge
i
would
be
set
fantastic
beer
throughout
lagunitas
did
a
great
job
with
this
brew
i
will
be
keeping
my
eye
out
for
more
overall
a
good
beer
ive
had
8
of
the
top
10
belgian
strong
pale
ales
listed
here
on
ba
but
this
is
a
fucking
joke
id
never
dream
of
putting
this
beer
in
the
same
category
as
duvel
duvel
is
untouchable
good
beer
yes
belgian
strong
pale
ale
bitch
please
drinkability
the
amount
of
hops
on
this
destroy
the
palate
so
only
one
of
these
in
an
evening
thank
you
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
though
im
not
certain
this
would
end
up
in
my
crate
again
happy
st
pattys
4
5
d
i
never
had
this
fresh
but
i
cant
imagine
it
ever
tasted
better
than
it
does
now
simply
fantastic
this
would
be
a
damn
tasty
ipa
by
itself
but
the
belgian
character
shines
through
and
complements
the
hops
better
than
i
ever
would
have
imagined
by
all
means
this
is
a
belgian
ipa
and
easily
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
maybe
we
need
a
new
category
for
brews
like
this
very
nice
take
on
an
old
style
but
with
a
very
well
done
west
coast
kick
to
it
d
its
strong
at
8
85
abv
so
it
cant
be
a
5
but
its
delicious
i
want
to
keep
drinking
it
even
though
it
builds
a
buzz
quickly
a
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
overall
a
really
nice
beer
its
light
crisp
and
tasty
while
still
having
a
delicious
fullness
d
wow
i
paid
4
for
this
bomber
really
solid
flavor
beer
that
has
a
lot
to
offer
especially
given
its
preice
point
i
need
to
go
but
more
of
this
pronto
definitely
recommended
poured
a
2
head
which
was
slow
to
dissipated
light
amber
in
color
smell
has
citrus
and
orange
and
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
same
and
its
really
like
a
medium
ipa
with
a
little
something
off
about
it
not
off
bad
just
off
different
unique
though
im
not
sure
its
my
1st
choice
dammit
i
was
going
to
open
an
abyss
tonight
and
she
talked
me
into
this
damn
thing
from
now
on
im
just
gonna
grab
a
6pack
whenever
i
see
these
little
sumpin
brews
earns
a
repeat
purchase
hands
down
overall
id
been
waiting
a
while
to
try
this
beer
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
a
very
well
done
beer
with
some
interesting
idiosyncracies
well
worth
a
shot
d
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
considering
its
strength
because
for
the
most
part
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
pours
out
a
goldenamber
with
a
sticky
frothy
and
full
off
white
head
excellent
lacing
after
each
sip
smell
consists
of
intense
pine
notes
grapefruit
rinds
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
begins
with
toasted
malt
character
followed
by
a
wave
of
caramel
sweetness
spicy
resinous
hops
then
barrage
the
palate
bringing
those
pine
and
grapefruit
characteristics
into
full
swing
with
some
lighter
citrus
notes
tailing
behind
sweetness
lingers
around
with
this
brew
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
noted
the
finish
is
moderately
bitter
with
just
a
slight
alcohol
presence
noticeable
hops
leave
a
lasting
impression
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
has
a
lighter
feel
to
it
much
more
than
expected
oily
resinous
hops
leave
a
slick
coating
and
the
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
this
brew
is
super
smooth
there
is
hardly
any
alcohol
noticeable
due
to
the
seemingly
intense
focus
on
hop
character
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
affordable
just
as
good
as
lil
sumpin
but
made
with
wild
yeast
had
on
tap
at
a
local
eatery
slightly
sweeter
maybe
this
is
because
of
the
yeast
strain
used
to
brew
the
beer
joshua
says
sweet
like
a
belgian
almost
i
thought
it
tasted
about
the
same
but
if
you
like
lil
sumpin
youll
like
this
one
too
d
i
mistakenly
assumed
this
to
a
wild
ale
when
i
purchased
it
until
i
looked
it
up
just
before
opening
it
while
im
not
disappointed
by
this
beer
at
all
its
drinkability
was
lower
than
i
had
set
myself
up
for
awesome
use
of
the
yeast
strain
though
served
chilled
in
a
westmalle
chalice
how
could
you
turn
this
down
its
an
ok
beer
that
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
again
the
guys
i
shared
it
with
seemed
to
think
it
was
ok
very
nice
beer
d
very
easy
to
down
the
pint
and
no
question
to
order
another
at
first
sip
you
get
a
big
punch
of
sour
alcohol
as
to
be
expected
with
this
8
85
by
volume
beer
but
after
it
settles
into
the
pallet
it
mellows
nicely
with
fruity
sourness
with
this
drink
i
ate
organic
green
chile
cheddar
cheese
what
a
great
pairing
the
creamy
rich
spicy
flavor
with
the
puckering
apple
alcohol
cheers
dont
know
what
else
to
say
good
quality
beer
wow
this
is
sumpin
wild
i
dont
exactly
know
what
this
is
other
than
good
at
8
85
very
easy
to
drink
and
drink
and
drink
a
nice
double
ipa
for
thise
who
like
them
sweet
and
juicy
and
another
great
reasonably
price
beer
from
a
stellar
brewery
lagunitas
should
get
more
plaudits
than
they
do
good
belgian
ipa
reminds
me
of
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
the
hops
are
still
the
main
player
like
in
all
of
lagunitas
beers
but
the
yeast
was
a
nice
touch
upon
trying
lil
sumptin
wild
i
was
more
then
pleased
by
it
the
smell
of
it
was
delicious
hints
of
citrus
and
pineapple
the
first
taste
was
even
better
and
was
very
drinkable
even
at
8
85
aloc
this
has
easily
become
a
constant
brew
that
is
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
enjoy
overall
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
and
have
recommended
it
to
friends
no
real
sense
of
booziness
and
immediately
wanted
another
one
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
offerings
pours
deep
golden
quite
luminous
with
good
clarity
nose
is
a
delight
with
mixed
fruit
barnyard
musty
notes
and
minerals
water
palate
lives
up
to
expectations
with
a
pleasant
brett
funk
herbal
flavors
and
a
quasihoney
biscuity
quality
finishes
with
minerally
flavors
drinkability
definitely
some
drinkability
to
this
beer
with
such
a
wonderful
display
of
hop
flavor
i
wish
more
of
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
were
displayed
in
the
overall
profile
of
this
beer
as
it
would
help
to
balance
the
rather
intense
fruitiness
definitely
a
belgianstyle
ipa
although
i
wish
the
belgian
characteristics
were
more
present
as
i
think
they
would
emphasize
the
wonderful
aromas
and
flavors
brought
on
by
the
hops
an
enjoyable
beer
for
hop
lovers
ive
had
a
couple
bottles
of
this
and
can
definitely
recommend
drinking
it
at
a
colder
ipa
temperature
than
a
more
moderate
wild
ale
temperature
it
moderates
the
sweetness
and
balances
out
the
flavor
nicely
d
this
beer
if
very
drinkable
it
has
a
great
flavor
and
it
goes
down
very
smooth
it
is
a
very
relaxing
drink
this
one
really
surprised
me
its
delicious
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
if
you
see
it
around
overall
impression
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
great
lagunitas
please
make
this
stuff
again
drink
pretty
damn
good
when
i
drank
it
i
had
no
idea
the
style
i
get
it
now
with
the
yeast
and
the
light
feel
fits
the
style
overall
i
was
looking
for
trying
this
one
as
i
really
like
the
sumpin
sumpin
ale
but
nothing
like
it
i
was
hoping
for
more
floraltype
hoppiness
in
this
one
and
i
felt
left
down
no
hop
for
me
just
pineapple
pineapple
taste
from
hop
i
like
pineapple
but
not
so
much
in
beer
still
a
very
decent
beer
is
this
supposed
to
be
a
belgian
yeast
strain
if
so
not
as
floral
as
i
would
have
expected
good
good
beer
for
me
but
perhaps
not
in
a
22
oz
bottle
may
be
my
favorite
of
the
little
sumpin
series
to
date
though
not
really
a
wild
ale
as
i
understand
the
concept
another
enjoyable
brew
from
lagunitas
theyve
yet
to
disappoint
d
goes
down
easy
i
opened
a
second
right
after
the
first
one
finished
8
85
abv
is
a
shock
for
such
a
smooth
beer
i
will
definately
get
a
few
more
of
these
d
this
beer
is
all
about
the
hops
and
i
didnt
think
there
was
anything
really
wild
about
this
one
the
westmalle
yeast
is
definitely
here
but
i
just
found
that
the
hops
overpowered
everything
else
a
decent
beer
though
d
very
drinkable
and
have
had
more
than
one
on
several
occasions
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
the
little
sumpin
sumpin
clear
gold
pour
with
a
2finger
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
orange
lemon
and
grapefruit
with
with
sweet
honey
and
cereal
grains
complemented
by
some
belgian
candi
soft
yeastiness
bubblegum
and
toffee
the
flavor
is
much
more
dominated
by
the
belgian
character
than
the
aroma
lots
of
pungent
clove
and
bubblegum
esters
upfront
with
a
healthy
dose
of
honey
candi
sugar
and
creamy
wheat
in
the
middle
the
hops
come
out
strong
on
the
finish
with
lots
of
bright
orange
peel
and
lemon
and
a
long
bitter
grapefruit
note
lingering
afterward
the
body
is
creamy
and
full
with
lots
of
gentle
carbonation
d
certainly
enjoyable
with
the
novelty
of
it
all
at
least
to
me
this
abv
and
the
sweetness
of
it
makes
it
a
one
and
done
type
of
beer
but
i
would
certainly
grab
this
again
in
the
future
for
something
a
little
different
drinkibility
not
bad
i
like
my
hop
fixes
a
little
less
sweet
this
pours
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
it
smells
very
hoppy
and
citrusy
the
flavor
is
very
full
leaving
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
belgian
style
ale
the
heavy
body
and
yeast
almost
knocks
you
down
it
is
smooth
and
well
balance
for
being
such
a
strong
beer
i
taste
malt
followed
by
strong
hops
it
is
not
boozy
like
you
might
expect
i
dont
love
belgian
beers
they
are
almost
always
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
pretty
good
though
o
another
very
good
effort
from
lagunitas
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
hop
stoopid
with
the
westmalle
yeast
similar
enough
to
be
recognized
but
different
enough
to
provoke
thought
interesting
beer
and
one
i
will
go
back
for
as
often
as
possible
for
3
50
a
bomber
drinks
ok
but
im
not
real
anxious
to
have
it
again
pushing
through
the
initial
character
is
difficult
but
you
are
rewarded
with
an
unusual
yet
interesting
balanced
combination
of
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
distracting
but
it
does
become
a
bit
more
tolerable
and
almost
smooth
once
the
mouthcoating
becomes
entrenched
feels
great
on
palate
nice
and
carbonated
to
go
with
the
lighter
texture
but
doesnt
feel
as
light
as
a
saison
like
lost
abbey
red
barn
ale
for
example
drinkability
is
awesome
poured
into
a
pint
glass
no
bottled
on
date
available
gave
a
great
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
1
finger
head
that
dissipated
quickly
a
bit
of
carbonation
initially
when
poured
is
visible
the
smell
i
have
to
say
i
was
impressed
with
i
get
a
lot
of
the
fruit
and
hops
i
know
this
is
brewed
with
a
wild
yeast
strain
and
i
dont
know
if
it
is
that
smell
the
primarily
overwhelms
my
pallet
or
something
else
it
definitely
is
a
wild
smell
the
taste
is
right
along
with
the
smell
the
wild
smell
carries
right
onto
the
tongue
a
really
wild
taste
but
for
all
its
worth
i
dont
think
that
it
helps
cover
the
alcohol
as
well
as
it
could
i
just
mean
to
say
i
can
tell
this
is
avb
8
85
i
would
probably
drink
a
bit
more
of
this
ale
if
it
were
a
little
easier
on
the
wallet
but
no
complaints
lagunitas
is
a
great
brewery
and
i
like
all
of
their
brews
thanks
o
a
really
unique
and
impressive
brew
i
cant
say
that
i
would
sit
down
and
ahve
3
or
4
of
these
however
i
would
buy
it
again
as
a
nice
unique
treat
d
very
drinkable
my
bomber
went
quickly
even
though
it
is
8
85
d
here
is
a
beer
that
would
stand
out
in
a
crowd
of
other
lagunitas
brewsdue
in
large
part
to
the
characteristics
imparted
by
the
abbey
yeast
used
here
while
certainly
adding
interest
the
qualities
encountered
here
arent
all
desirable
compared
to
their
ipa
and
hop
stoopid
once
or
a
few
times
a
year
is
fine
but
this
is
not
a
flavor
profile
the
typical
ipalover
would
want
to
be
stuck
with
while
not
reviewed
here
i
did
sample
this
beer
ondraft
during
a
recent
visit
to
the
brewery
and
found
it
to
be
generally
more
appealing
with
less
emphasis
on
the
funk
and
more
vibrant
hop
aromatics
d
an
unusual
take
on
the
style
to
be
sure
very
drinkable
though
wild
wildy
fruity
thats
for
sure
and
much
more
belgian
ipa
than
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
who
cares
whats
its
called
this
is
just
a
high
quality
quaff
how
is
it
possible
lagunitas
stuff
sells
for
less
than
5
a
bomber
four
time

east
of

either
a

or
imp
a

in
either
case
another
winner
from
lagunitas
hope
i
can
have
this
ontap
sometime
in
the
near

recommended
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
beer
will
grow
on
you
with
every
sip
i
wouldnt
buy
another
because
this
style
is
not
my
favorite
but
for
those
of
you
who
like
a
bit
of
hoppiness
along
with
some
good
body
a
really
nice
appearance
in
yer
glass
and
a
healthy
8
85
abv
at
a
very
decent
price
get
one
if
you
can
overall
an
excellent
beer
tastes
less
like
a
belgian
than
it
smells
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
really
nice
brew
unique
and
interesting
well
balanced
tasty
and
easy
drinking
drinkability
yes
will
buy
it
when
i
find
it
excellent
beer
and
very
reasonably
priced
id
pick
this
one
over
some
more
authentic
belgian
beers
even
if
they
were
the
same
price
very
tasty
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
better
balance
between
the
yeast
and
hop
flavors
d
very
very
much
so
no
alcohol
burn
and
it
just
goes
down
nice
and
easy
great
game
day
beer
imo
little
sumpin
wild
lacks
the
vivacity
charm
and
siren
drinkability
that
little
sumpin
sumpin
possesses
its
like
a
standin
for
that
beer
and
having
paid
full
price
for
this
bomber
makes
me
a
little
disappointed
to
find
out
it
wouldnt
make
any
beer
gone
wild
videos
thats
for
sure
no
matter
this
bottle
was
still
an
unregrettable
one
night
stand
this
stuff
is
close
to
to
drinkable
the
stuff
is
very
strong
and
the
alcohol
isnt
nearly
as
perceivable
as
you
would
think
in
a
beer
this
big
this
is
not
a
subtle
beer
quite
the
opposite
it
is
almost
inelegant
in
its
presentation
this
a
brute
force
of
a
beer
an
atom
bomb
of
flavor
with
a
dryness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
letting
you
know
whose
bitch
you
are
this
is
a
to
use
a
film
cliche
tour
de
force
beer
it
will
definitely
give
the
palate
a
workout
but
is
well
worth
the
experperience
the
willingness
to
take
an
awesome
beer
like
sumpin
sumpin
and
add
belgian
yeast
to
it
to
further
push
the
envelope
is
why
lagunitas
is
my
favorite
brewery
well
truth
in
advertising
i
can
always
appreciate
a
stock
in
a
good
way
lagunitas
strong
ale
leavened
by
the
addition
of
some
oldschool
monkyeast
the
result
exactly
what
one
would
expect
a
slightly
yeasttinged
a
westmalle
joint
yo
usual
suspect
hop
and
malt
bomb
an
interesting
experiment
what
with
the
familiar
west
coast
eyeopener
melded
onto
a
sudden
realization
of
noble
belgian
heritage
wild
in
doubt
wild
indeed
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
color
with
very
little
head
to
speak
of
a
thin
lace
ring
stays
with
the
beer
throughout
the
session
the
aroma
is
one
of
fruit
i
swear
i
smell
a
cider
yeast
and
hops
i
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
it
has
a
variety
of
things
going
on
nice
sweet
fruit
taste
at
the
beginning
and
finishes
with
a
nice
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
nice
amount
of
alcohol
taste
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
an
8
abv
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
at
5
for
a
bomber
this
is
also
a
great
value
o
this
was
very
good
i
think
it
fits
better
into
the
belgian
ipa
category
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
ad
well
balanced
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
quasi
belgian
ipa
for
almost
9
abv
it
is
hidden
quite
well
but
the
belgian
phenols
become
increasingly
evident
as
the
brew
warms
drinkability
an
amazing
beer
that
is
dangerously
easy
to
drink
with
the
almost
9
abv
not
necessarily
the
most
traditional
belgium
strong
pale
ale
but
an
amazing
addition
the
lagunitas
lineup
apple
juicegolden
hue
with
a
two
finger
white
head
decent
retention
noticeable
hop
aroma
dare
i
say
it
wouldnt
be
a
lagunitas
brew
without
it
yes
i
do
some
yeast
aromas
too
kinda
sweet
with
a
more
upfront
pinealmostgrapefruit
aroma
im
also
smelling
just
a
hint
of
melon
chewy
texture
like
a
thick
belgian
pale
ale
no
strong
carbonated
presence
theres
an
interesting
play
with
the
hops
and
the
wild
aspect
of
the
beer
this
beer
as
some
subtle
funk
to
it
for
sure
but
its
not
sour
its
more
like
a
tangerine
flavor
it
plays
with
the
hops
in
a
curious
manner
burntsweet
malt
flavors
too
theres
some
hope
aftertaste
with
a
soursweet
finish
lagunitas
has
a
way
with
their
beers
especially
when
trying
to
make
things
come
together
like
ive
said
in
the
past
all
the
right
flavors
are
there
just
not
always
working
together
there
seems
to
be
a
little
more
team
work
in
this
beer
but
im
not
in
love
with
the
conclusion
definitely
worth
a
try
just
not
going
back
for
seconds
a
little
sumpin
wild
has
got
it
its
got
a
good
american
hop
flavor
and
its
got
the
westmalle
yeast
to
yield
sweet
flavors
from
the
malt
this
is
like
a
little
sumpin
extra
taking
a
trip
to
belgium
excellent
stuff
at
a
great
price
only
4
49
for
a
bomber
at
total
wine
d
tasty
and
light
with
no
hint
of
the
higher
abv
very
easy
drinking
lagunitas
does
it
again
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
highly
drinkable
really
delicious
but
the
abv
does
come
to
get
you
lots
of
effervescence
on
the
tongue
good
pale
malt
start
but
it
fades
quickly
to
a
strong
hop
of
black
pepper
and
grapefruit
rind
could
easily
pass
for
a
belgianstyle
ipa
rich
feel
to
the
mouth
despite
the
high
carbonation
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
piney
hop
to
it
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
its
light
flavors
and
enticing
flavors
i
suspect
this
brewer
like
a
few
others
rogue
hop
heavier
for
the
style
than
i
think
appropriate
if
so
good
to
know
ahead
of
time
overall
though
its
a
good
beer
if
a
bit
off
style
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
good
head
retention
and

very

tropical

a
crisp

a
nice

that
lasts

leaves
nice

on
the

aroma
is
crisp
earthy
citrus
hops
and
a
nice
kick
of
belgian
spice
in

of
sweet

malts
the
taste
is
smooth
citrus
hops
up
front
with
a
nice
kick
of
spices
followed
by
a
nice
bitter
citrus
hop
finish
the
beer
is
only
slightly
heavy
with
smooth
carbonation
and
mild
dryness
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
from
lagunitas
i
hope
this
becomes
at
least
an
annual
release
other
comments
the
wild
thing
is
a
little
misleading
when
i
bought
it
i
thought
it
would
have
some
wild
yeast
in
it
or
something
had
this
on
tap
at
their
brewpub
on
a
hot
day
and
on
a
cold
rainy
day
either
way
works
fine
my
brother
wanted
to
be
clever
and
review
this
beer
so
he
said
the
wild
citrus
flavor
dances
upon
my
tongue
frivolously
in
the
night
as
i
thirst
for
revenge
wow
im
speechless
dexcellent
value
i
would
gladly
pay
the
3
bucks
again
for
this
bomber
very
nice
its
interesting
that
this
beer
is
labeled
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
to
me
this
beer
tastes
smells
and
drinks
more
like
a
double
ipa
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
offering
from
lagunitas
that
i
have
had
d
good
drinkability
not
overpowering
d
this
stuff
is
fantastic
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
the
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
and
the
sweet
fruity
hops
make
it
absolutely
delicious
this
company
pumps
out
winners
like
no
other
very
drinkable
i
love
this
beer
and
its
a
style
that
i
usually
do
not
like
d
at
72
ibus
and
8
85
abv
i
would
say
that
this
is
very
drinkable
it
leaves
a
warm
feeling
that
persuades
the
mind
in
to
wanting
just
one
more
pint
of
deliciousness
this
beer
isnt
exactly
true
to
the
style
its
hoppy
and
the
hops
are
distinctly
american
tasting
but
it
is
very
delicious
and
far
too
drinkable
great
price
too
its
even
better
on
tap
though
when
i
had
it
on
tap
i
was
way
too
far
gone
to
write
a
proper
review
this
beer
can
knock
you
on
your
rear
before
you
know
what
happened
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
as
good
a
beer
as
sumpin
sumpin
was
but
its
still
a
very
high
quality
beer
worth
having
especailly
at
lagunitas
prices
bomber
from
wf
arlington
too
me
this
just
tastes
like
hop
stupid
or
sumpin
extra
with
some
belgian
yeast
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
but
i
doubt
a
new
hybrid
style
will
come
as
a
result
just
a
little
belgian
flair
for
our
well
loved
west
coast
hop
bombs
this
ones
worth
trying
without
doubt
mdleaves
a
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
a
great
beer
easy
drinker
super
smooth
amazing
value
less
of
a
bspa
to
me
and
more
like
an
ipa
its
eminently
drinkable
and
you
get
a
lot
of
hoppy
flavors
and
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
there
is
a
hint
of
bitterness
right
at
the
front
but
it
dissipates
quickly
and
changes
to
grapefruity
west
coast
style
hop
flavor
the
balance
that
is
struck
between
the
hope
flavor
and
the
belgian
yeast
really
makes
this
a
drinkable
everyday
kind
of
beer
drinkability
easy
drinking
excellent
beer
pours
more
clear
than
expected
with
a
nice
head
some
nice
hops
on
the
nose
much
more
hop
taste
than
expected
but
very
tasty
i
agree
with
others
that
this
is
not
belgian
enough
for
me
but
is
a
nice
beer
more
a
dipa
would
drink
again
for
sureand
will
know
what
to
expect
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
i
find
myself
torn
between
the
fact
that
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
wellmade
brew
by
the
folks
at
lagunitas
and
the
fact
that
its
also
just
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
this
is
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
quite
simply
the
addition
of
the
westmalle
yeast
seems
to
take
the
back
seat
to
the
hoppiness
of
this
beer
and
doesnt
strike
me
as
remarkably
belgian
cheers
d
very
tasty
beer
easy
to
drink
and
much
hoppier
than
expected
drinks
easy
nice
effort
somewhat
reminds
me
of
boulevard
tank7
d
i
usually
like
lagunitas
beers
but
this
one
did
not
impress
me
for
me
this
is
an
average
at
best
beer
probably
wont
want
to
try
this
one
again
i
hade
this
on
tap
at
the
spinnerstown
hotel
it
followed
my
first
taste
of
101010
this
beer
pours
with
a
red
tint
smell
is
very
hoppy
i
would
call
this
a
strong
belgian
ipa
the
hop
flavor
is
really
strong
when
first
poured
it
tasted
like
a
weak
nugget
nectar
as
it
warmed
the
belgian
flavor
was
more
dominant
goes
down
easier
when
warmer
mediumlight
body
with
nice
high
carbonation
dry
finish
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
making
in
dangerously
drinkable
not
funky
in
the
least
but
a
very
tasty
balanced
and
easydrinking
belgianinfluenced
hoppy
ale
a
great
value
to
boot
had
this
ontap
at
the
happy
gnome
in
st
paul
no
it
wasnt
terribly
wild
but
it
was
a
fine
hoppy
belgian
pale
ale
i
was
surprised
how
well
these
guys
pulled
off
the
mix
of
peppery
belgian
yeast
character
with
fruity
hops
id
say
the
brewery
has
made
good
use
of
the
westmalle
strain
check
it
out
d
a
dangerous
brew
at
nearly
9
abv
but
quite
balanced
and
tasty
with
a
nice
aesthetic
showing
indeed
perhaps
not
the
most
traditional
belgian
strong
pale
you
could
imagine
but
one
with
distinct
american
flair
and
bitterness
a
nice
brew
and
one
id
definitely
have
again
this
drinks
tastes
and
feels
like
a
dipa
and
a
very
good
one
to
boot
but
i
just
wished
it
had
more
of
that
westmalle
yeast
strain
its
there
but
hardly
still
a
great
tasting
hard
hitting
ipa
and
if
thats
what
you
want
definatly
worth
a
try
if
you
want
more
of
a
belgian
thing
look
for
something
else
a
little
sumpin
wild
is
not
the
american
wild
ale
i
expected
perhaps
i
should
read
the
forums
more
nonetheless
it
is
a
very
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
use
of
american
hops
certainly
adds
some
pizzazz
to
already
tasty
style
and
gives
it
a
unique
flavor
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
the
bodys
a
little
too
thin
good
stuff
otherwise
in
typical
lagunitas
fashion
d
very
enjoyable
and
easy

beer
at

not
certain

to

it

elements
similar
to
a

and
similar
to

strong

the
yeast
presence
is
what
makes
it
similar
to
a
bspa
really
good
overall
almost
a
cross
between
a
tropical
ipa
and
a
saison
im
not
typically
a
huge
fan
of
the
belgian

class
of
brews
but
this
one
is
actually
quite

would
be

almost

from

juicy
slightly

one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
not
sure
how
this
is
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
drink
more
ipa
than
belgian
a
little
sumpin
wild
is
light
and
fluffy
yet
goes
down
easy
with
a
lot
of
flavor
overall
excellent
beer
overall
the
nose
is
the
only
thing
that
could
use
a
little
improvement
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
notemy
palate
and
nose
are
clean
and
in
good
order
i
wonder
why
im
not
getting
a
lot
of
the
westmalle
esthery
notes
described
in
other
reviews
dont
know
hmmm
bit
this
was
a
darn
good
beer
fo
sho
finally
i
can
put
a
face
to
the
name
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
honeydew
grapefruit
pine
and
sweet
caramel
the
taste
is
very
similar
though
the
melon
is
decidedly
meeker
here
and
the
caramel
seems
a
bit
more
assertive
even
if
its
still
definitely
subservient
to
the
hoppier
aspects
the
body
is
lightish
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
rather
liquid
feel
overall
a
solid
brew
one
i
hope
to
have
later
on
down
the
road
its
a
good
beer
but
its
tart
to
the
point
of
almost
feeling
chalky
its
hard
to
express
this
because
i
really
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
but
on
the
other
hand
it
took
away
from
the
drinkability
ultimately
its
always
been
good
to
see
lagunitas
expand
their
horizons
but
this
brew
is
more
of
an
ipa
and
definitely
is
wild
this
beer
has
a
nice
golden
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
some
hop
notes
of
piny
and
lemony
aromas
are
but
there
is
a
sweet
malt
undercurrent
that
is
quite
nice
as
well
during
the
first
sips
the
hop
flavors
are
the
first
to
attack
the
tongue
with
a
little
bitterness
a
slight
liquor
taste
soon
follows
the
aftertaste
mostly
comprises
of
the
caramel
malts
and
lemon
zest
the
hop
flavors
are
prominent
but
they
are
smooth
and
mellow
without
bittering
too
much
the
alcohol
also
is
rather
smooth
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
a
sipper
but
its
pretty
good
d
well
its
pretty
good
for
a
fairly
strong
beer
not
something
id
chug
but
i
will
take
down
this
bomber
comfortably
for
the
price
and
the
taste
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
such
a
unique
tasting
beer
like
a
pale
alehefe
put
together
overall
a
nice
hoppy
offering
from
lagunitas
really
tasty
original
and
affordable
seek
this
out
d
this
is
another
great
brew
from
lagunitas
the
8
5
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
fresh
juicy
hops
pair
well
with
the
westmalle
yeast
lagunitas
a
little
sumpin
wild
is
a
clear
dense
golden
ale
with
a
small
elastic
white
head
it
has
a
fresh
aroma
thats
very
fruity
like
tropical
fruit
its
floral
and
grassy
it
smells
great
its
pretty
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
a
clean
dry
finish
its
very
hoppy
and
bitter
from
start
to
finish
its
a
green
bitterness
like
pine
and
juniper
theres
a
funky
grumble
just
before
the
finish
where
the
yeast
flavors
blend
with
the
hop
flavors
this
is
where
the
alcohol
presents
itself
to
continue
on
to
a
peppercorn
finish
wow
the
yeast
isnt
distracting
and
it
all
works
i
happily
gulped
this
beer
down
two
nights
in
a
row
and
imagine
i
will
do
it
again
good
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
drinkability
for
the
style
it
seems
like
a
kind
of
light
ipa
i
like
this
much
more
than
the
regular
little
sumpin
though
admittedly
i
havent
had
that
in
some
time
still
this
is
a
much
more
uniquealbeit
stronger
take
on
the
same
beer
d
i
would
have
this
again
a
really
nice
brew
this
is
really
nice
and
worth
having
at
least
once
a
really
nice
hopped
up
belgian
that
drinks
well
worth
trying
for
sure
especially
at
lagunitas
price
point
medium
body
good
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
nice
d
another
good
one
from
lagunitas
dont
think
id
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
one
sitting
very
complex
and
interesting
flavors
i
enjoyed
it
verdict
the
belgian
yeast
and
hop
additions
certainly
transformed
this
into
something
new
though
im
not
convinced
its
an
improvement
however
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
and
belgian
ipas
this
is
a
surefire
winner
d
no
alcohol
taste
each
sip
makes
you
want
more
affordable
and
well
worth
a
try
i
was
expecting
something
different
but
i
am
completely
satisfied
with
what
came
from
this
bottle
yet
another
lagunitas
beer
that
makes
me
smile
check
it
drinkability
while
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
its
designated
style
well
it
is
a
tasty
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
high
abv
i
can
see
this
as
an
approach
to
a
bspa
but
with
a
lot
of
hops
22oz
bottle

good
deal
as
always
clear
yellow
color
decent
lace
good
head
it
smells
super
hoppy
like
citrus
and
lemons
and
oranges
the
taste
is
much
the
same
dominated
by
hoppiness
and
i
could
not
detect
the
belgian
westmalle
yeast
influence
in
the
slightest
this
really
was
just
like
a
lil
sumpin
sumpin
to
me
which
was
ok
because
it
was
still
delicious
i
have
to
get
a
couple
more
bottles
while
they
are
fresh
beer
could
have
used
a
little
more
carbonation
perfect
bitterness
matching
sweetness
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
i
really
dont
think
it
is
to
style
at
all
but
this
is
a
great
belgian
ipa
this
drank
like
a
bitter
my
new
favorite
belgian
beer
drinkability
fantastic
brew
id
drink
more
d
lswa
is
an
interesting
departure
from
the
baseline
staple
i
like
this
brew
as
i
like
lsea
the
other
permutation
but
the
originals
explosion
of
flavor
and
overall
juiciness
is
without
peer
in
the
style
this
belgian
ipa
is
awfully
good
but
honestly
i
still
like
flying
dog
raging
bitch
a
little
better
mild
carbonation
this
beer
is
exceptional
and
if
you
have
the
chance
pick
2
up
cause
the
first
will
not
be
enough
taste
is
fantastic
its
a
bit
spicy
think
nutmeg
or
similar
its
pretty
rich
and
sweet
very
creamy
and
damn
drinkable
poured
into
pint
glasses
has
a
nice
goldengolden
brown
appearance
with
a
short
and
quickly
disappearing
head
the
smell
is
great
sweet
and
slightly
grassy
the
mouthfeel
is
good
ample
bubbles
while
retaining
a
nice
wetness
the
taste
is
similar
to
sumpin
sumpin
but
with
a
slight
grassyearthy
note
it
is
very
pleasant
with
enough
character
to
savour
while
maintaining
drinkability
d
wow
it
sure
is
strong
going
down
i
am
enjoying
the
brew
even
though
its
big
time
tropical
and
sweet
to
keep
them
going
thats
not
a
bad
thing
just
a
little
bit
of
sipper
than
a
gulper
great
job
lagunitas
a
little
sumpin
wild
is
an
odd
brew
as
a
double
ipa
this
is
a
clear
hop
heads
delight
its
quite
drinkable
for
its
size
the
8
85
abv
only
starts
to
show
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
unfortunately
the
belgian
yeast
strain
is
almost
completely
lost
the
usual
qualities
of
belgian
ipa
or
strong
pale
arent
there
as
a
belgian
style
beer
sumpin
wild
is
a
letdown
in
the
end
this
winds
up
as
just
another
tasty
double
ipa
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
at
all
that
being
said
to
rate
this
beer
to
style
i
cant
see
calling
this
a
bspa
belgian
ipa
would
be
a
bit
more
appropriate
but
still
the
american
hops
are
too
much
thankfully
i
could
care
less
about
style
when
im
not
reviewing
so
i
can
still
enjoy
this
beer
for
all
its
greatness
i
liked
this
no
sense
of
booze
in
the
flavor
at
all
enjoy
fermented
with
westmalle
yeast
according
to
the
label
but
there
is
nothing
belgian
or
wild
to
this
one
just
a
standard
dipa
and
pretty
much
standard
lagunitas
as
well
hop
heads
rejoice
everyone
else
move
on
tried
this
beer
at
brewtopia
in
chelsea
last
week
and
knew
it
was
something
i
had
to
have
again
picked
up
a
bomber
and
it
was
just
as
i
had
remembered
near
excellence
poured
bright
gold
like
carbonated
motts
apple
juice
head
was
prominent
but
faded
fast
leaving
a
lasting
film
on
the
beer
and
glass
carbonation
level
is
perfect
just
enough
smells
like
an
imperial
ipa
with
mild
malt
backbone
but
taste
is
totally
different
hops
hit
you
but
not
as
some
high
ibu
bears
this
one
is
in
the
70s
but
so
complex
you
cant
complain
as
the
taste
settles
you
get
the
caramel
flavor
which
if
you
look
at
the
beer
it
seems
to
pale
to
have
piney
hops
not
very
citrusy
which
i
loved
aftertaste
is
sugar
coated
grass
and
a
slight
alcohol
sting
this
beer
is
one
of
my
top
5
i
like
what
lagunitas
is
doing
here
sure
they
used
a
belgian
yeast
and
maybe
the
classification
wound
up
being
bspa
but
why
not
just
make
it
their
own
twist
on
an
ipa
they
do
have
a
beer
called
hop
stoopid
theyve
always
been
one
of
my
top
choices
for
bangforyourbuck
bombers
and
at
5
49
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
a
little
sumpin
more
to
go
with
their
liquor
store
purchase
this
is
an
interesting
strong
pale
ale
the
strong
hops
combination
provides
intense
floral
characteristics
and
gives
a
flavor
of
fresh
tar
with
a
little
skunkiness
this
pungent
flavor
lingers
in
the
mouth
for
good
amount
of
time
there
is
only
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
to
this
beer
this
is
definitely
a
beer
you
have
to
be
in
to
mood
for
as
the
flavors
can
seem
a
bit
overwhelming
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
its
strength
keeps
it
from
being
really
drinkable
though
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
great
yellowgolden
color
truly
awesome
lacing
sticks
around
for
the
duration
of
the
drink
1
finger
perfect
white
foam
smell
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
for
me
with
a
strong
pine
scent
hitting
first
followed
by
pineapple
and
citrus
its
an
intense
aroma
developing
more
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
strong
pale
ale
at
first
but
goes
down
very
clean
with
little
aftertaste
but
an
oiliness
on
the
tongue
and
throat
tons
of
carbonation
very
bubbly
extremely
drinkable
i
put
this
whole
bottle
down
myself
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
to
friends
very
light
and
drinkable
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
a
slight
chill
hazed
burnt
orange
with
a
big
blooming
white
head
that
settled
very
slowly
into
a
creamy
mass
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
a
big
blast
of
citric
hopi
detect
some
amarillo
i
believethen
the
phenols
come
rollin
in
with
some
clovelike
spice
i
really
wanted
to
like
the
flavors
more
but
i
couldnt
get
myself
tostarted
out
great
with
a
shot
of
citric
and
aspirinlike
hopsbut
the
phenols
take
over
with
slight
funk
and
spice
alot
of
people
like

i
like

a

beer
overall
and
an
easy
and
enjoyable
summer
quaffer
for
sure
pours
a
very
nice
bright
orange
crystal
clear
color
with
a
just
off
white
head
that
lasts
for
a
long
time
leaves
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
the
appearance
is
very
similar
to
pte
the
aroma
is
big
time
grapefruit
tangerine
and
some
honey
on
the
finish
really
like
pte
as
well
very
strange
on
this
but
its
a
beautiful
hoppy
sweet
nose
perfect
the
flavor
is
very
nice
big
hops
and
a
malty
finish
great
acidic
hops
and
even
some
sweet
bready
malts
that
balance
it
out
fruity
esters
also
spot
on
carbonation
and
dry
finish
gives
this
great
potential
to
pair
with
barbecue
for
sure
i
really
think
this
beer
is
a
home
run
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
d
high
i
think
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
wow
i
hope
to
see
more
beers
brewed
like
this
american
style
belgian
yeast
awesome
blasted
shaker
pint
a
tulip
would
do
wonders
for
this
one
regardless
this
is
a
tasty
beer
ill
not
hold
the
glassware
against
it
definitely
worth
a
try
im
glad
to
have
stumbled
across
it
on
tap
flavor
is
very
nice
hop
profile
has
a
nice
amount
of
citrus
some
spice
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
wheat
provides
hints
of
banana
and
clove
lightly
noticeable
under
the
hop
profile
very
crisp
quenching
mouthfeel
which
helps
make
it
extremely
drinkable
flavors
mask
the
alcohol
almost
completely
something
wild
looks
like
a
mix
of
ipa
and
spa
with
a
bright
yellow
color
with
some
minimal
orange
highlights
cant
really
see
through
the
liquid
its
not
that
clear
cut
a
nice
whisp
of
bright
white
foam
on
top
with
some
stickies
smell
is
ipa
mixed
in
with
bananas
and
yeast
i
get
a
tropic
sense
and
a
bready
sense
pineapple
mango
yeast
taste
is
weird
the
yeast
really
takes
center
stage
and
blows
everything
out
da
water
either
this
is
the
end
of
the
keg
or
the
westmalle
yeast
is
just
that
powerful
tropic
fruits
alot
of
bananers
and
yeast
malt
under
all
of
that
feel
is
medium
and
nicely
carbed
up
this
kinda
felt
like
juice
going
down
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
drinkability
was
alright
i
did
not
feel
the
need
to
have
another
im
going
to
say
this
is
good
beer
for
now
but
i
think
a
bottle
will
be
in
store
for
the
future
so
i
can
get
more
of
an
ipa
taste
from
it
this
serving
type
was
yeasted
up
big
time
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
sticky
as
the
carbonation
and
dry
finish
cant
help
the
medium
body
from
leaving
some
oily
coating
behind
the
citrus
hops
dont
fade
as
the
slightly
chalky
yeast
slams
on
the
brakes
and
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
this
is
a
good
beer
and
very
pleasant
in
just
about
every
aspect
what
did
we
learn
today
besides
that
i
can
type
a
review
of
a
beer
through
a
glass
filled
with
said
brew
i
guess
ugly
betty
really
shines
once
you
can
get
past
the
frumpy
appearance
this
beer
has
the
excellent
flavor
of
little
sumpin
sumpin
with
a
little
more
body
and
mouthfeel
the
belgian
yeast
seems
to
jive
well
with
the
hop
character
drinkability
only
rated
this
a
3
5
just
because
its
such
a
wonderful
beer
that
you
should
savor
this
one
not
really
anything
too
wild
about
this
beer
but
it
is
a
good
drink
on
tap
at
hop
leaf
into
a

the

is
fruity
to
start
tangerine
banana
a
little

and
belgian

expected
a
little
sourness
but
not
much
there
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
fruity
to
start
with
yeast
finish
this
is
not
bad
just
nothing

aka
a
typical
lagunitas

great

definitely

very

sorry
if
you
dont
feel
the

overall
a

like
a

fairly
drinkable
some
nice
flavors
all
around
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
the
carbonation
was
gentle
very
easy
to
drink
and
well
done
i
wish
i
had
several
more
bottles
of
this
beer
not
really
a
sessionable
beer
but
think
i
could
drink
alot
of
them
please
send
bottles
up
to
seattle
dthis
is
really
drinkable
im
almost
finished
the
22oz
and
im
ready
for
another
one
great
drinkability
at
8
85
abv
i
wish
and
pray
this
could
be
a
year
round
or
seasonal
at
some
point
one
of
my
new
favorite
brews
thank
you
lagunitas
a
drinkability
very
drinkable
split
the
22
oz
bomber
but
could
have
easily
enjoyed
the
entire
bottle
myself
then
opened
another
one
d
it
really
is
an
easy
drinker
their
website
lists
it
at
7
5
it
is
almost
in
tripel
territory
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
have
it
at
one
of
the
ba
fests
and
thought
it
was
great
d
very
very
nice
this
seems
to
be
more
than
anything
a
belgian
ipa
but
it
has
a
really
strong
malt
and
yeast
character
that
one
rarely
sees
in
american
brewed
interpretations
of
the
style
the
fruity
hops
work
perfectly
with
the
belgian
yeast
and
in
the
finish
it
is
hard
to
tell
which
flavors
are
coming
from
hops
and
which
are
the
yeast
all
of
this
complexity
is
supported
by
a
lightly
sweet
and
perfectly
smooth
base
of
malty
goodness
that
makes
the
beer
eminently
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
would
love
to
see
it
as
a
regular
seasonal
very
impressive
effort
by
lagunitas
im
always
a
little
wary
of
beers
that
combine
american
hops
and
belgian
yeast
but
this
one
works
lagunitas
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
their
beers
are
always
solid
and
the
prices
cant
be
beat
highly
recommended
the
flavor
opens
up
as
the
most
aggressive
sumpin
to
date
as
rugged
leafy
hop
cones
lay
down
a
smacking
bitterness
quickly
followed
by
tropical
fruitflavored
booze
the
smooth
wheat
malt
and
belgian
yeast
notes
are
a
bit
overpowered
here
but
i
like
the
result
nonetheless
mouthfeel
nears
heavilybodied
with
a
sticky
syrupy
finish
that
lingers
with
hop
oils
and
more
alcohol
sumpin
wild
is
just
that
wild
it
takes
the
palate
for
a
complex
rollercoaster
ride
and
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
recommended
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
if
this
were
food
i
would
eat
it
for
three
meals
a
day
get
it
while
you
can
drinkability
as
always
a
quality
product
at
a
reasonable
in
general
and
by
pa
standards
price
from
lagunitas
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
i
like
that
the
westmalle
yeast
added
to
this
beer
definitely
might
have
to
get
some
more
bottles
of
this
if
it
doesnt
sell
out
before
i
do
delicious
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
this
beer
pours
yelloworangegold
a
color
i
just
made
up
with
a
big
puffy
white
head
its
entirely
transparent
filtered
i
guess
not
really
sure
why
thats
necessary
the
aroma
is
big
and
hoppy
lots
of
wildflowers
tangerines
candied
lemon
peel
underneath
the
hop
aromas
the
westmalle
yeast
chimes
in
with
earth
bright
stone
fruits
and
some
very
mild
spice
the
malt
lends
a
honeyed
bread
note
its
quite
a
nice
aroma
though
much
more
hopdominant
than
any
belgian
beer
ive
tried
the
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
with
an
excellently
bitter
finish
the
hopmalt
balance
is
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
wild
or
not
and
its
definitely
not
in
the
sense
that
most
expected
this
is
an
excellent
beer
im
actually
enjoying
this
bottle
more
than
the
draft
version
i
tried
over
the
summer
d
for
this
particular
stylewhich
usually
isnt
very
drinkable
this
one
was
quite
nice
and
enjoyable
high
expectations
for
this
guy
after
trying
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
a
while
ago
ive
learned
that
belgian
yeastiness
works
well
with
ipa
flavors
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
its
a
bright
rich
auburn
with
some
pleasing
head
that
settles
into
a
sparse
film
it
smells
absolutely
delicious
floral
and
grapey
and
pretty
sharp
but
pleasantly
so
tasting
it
isnt
a
letdown
very
cold
it
was
extremely
reminiscent
of
some
riesling
wines
ive
had
a
very
sweet
grape
flavor
warming
and
opening
up
some
it
is
still
a
bit
grapey
but
with
some
great
yeasty
bittersweet
palate
play
and
a
hoppy
finish
this
makes
me
very
curious
about
the
other
iterations
of
little
sumpin
and
is
a
great
addition
albeit
a
temporary
one
to
the
illustrious
lagunitas
collection
lagunitas
really
needs
to
consider
making
something
like
this
at
least
a
seasonal
offering
if
not
year
round
a
really
nice
beer
love
the
aroma
if
im
reading
the
stealth
bottling
code
right
this
was
bottled
aug
30
d
man
i
love
this
stuff
lagunitas
is
always
a
good
bargain
i
need
more
of
this
stuff
while
its
around
cabonation
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
nice
and
crisp
decent
drinkability
d
this
wasnt
nearly
as
wild
as
expected
i
thought
it
was
brewed
with
brett
instead
of
westmalles
yeast
but
it
was
still
vibrant
and
delicious
body
was
a
bit
weak
but
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
i
love
all
of
the
sumpins
but
they
are
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
other
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
one
d
overall
a
nice
take
on
this
trend
belgian
yeast
american
hops
d
i
wasnt
exactly
sure
what
the
wild
character
of
this
beer
was
upon
drinking
it
though
some
research
has
shown
this
beer
did
spend
some
time
with
brett
at
this
point
its
like
most
of
the
other
good
lagunitas
beers
hoppy
served
from

into
a
weizen
glass
poured
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
hops
citrus
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
malt
sweet
hops
with
a
bitter
hop
followthrough
attacking
your
taste
buds
upon
swallowing
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
to
enjoy
it
just
needed
a
little
more
on
the
flavor
to
be
great
the
aroma
was
quite
excellent
however
this
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
i
also
wish
they
hadnt
given
it
a
misleading
name
that
contains
wild
which
it
most
certainly
is
not
note
i
am
just
mentioning
this
i
just
hope
that
it
shows
up
in
bottles
soon
so
i
can
have
it
again

like

the
malt
characteristics
are
good
and
showcases
that
telltale
perfumy
so
there
is
very
little
sweeetness
in
this
beer
and
the
estery
characteristics
im
getting
a

of

reminding
me
of

i
knew
would
be
there
according
to
the
smell
on
the
thicker
side
of
hoppy
beers
that
arent
considered
dipas
but
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
i
can
tell
that
the
alcohol
by
volume
is
higher
than
most
ipas
but
not
in
a
bad
way
finishing
the

by
myself
is
no

just
has
such

stillwaters
belgianstyle
ipa
is
a
nearperfect
blend
of
belgian
and
american
tastes
that
start
with
the
iconic
fruity
and
spice
balance
of
belgian
ale
but
also
leads
with
the
citrusy
dryness
of
ipa
yet
secondary
flavors
of
red
apple
and
honey
give
the
ale
a
notsofresh
taste
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
a
farmhouse
ale
but
i
dont
think
it
really
fits
into
the
belgian
ipa
category
simply
because
the
hops
are
on
the
lighter
side
and
they
dont
impart
that
bitterness
that
i
would
expect
from
a
belgian
ipa
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
crisp
a
little
refreshing
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
without
getting
bored
with
it
but
i
think
that
would
be
my
limit
and
i
think
it
makes
for
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
spring
and
summer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
funky
yeast
aspect
i
thought
it
was
at
the
right
level
and
its
just
what
i
expect
from
a
good
farmhouse
ale
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
i
liked
how
easy
drinking
it
was
and
the
fact
that
it
was
a
little
refreshing
helped
that
out
also
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
hop
aspect
it
was
nice
but
i
wish
the
hops
stuck
out
more
and
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
bitterness
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
farmhouse
ales
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
thought
the
hop
profile
held
this
beer
back
from
being
as
good
as
it
could
be
and
i
think
with
some
more
hops
this
would
be
a
pretty
great
example
of
a
hoppy
farmhouse
ale
this
isnt
my
favorite
of
the
style
or
my
favorite
beer
from
stillwater
but
i
still
think
its
a
solid
beer
in
its
own
right

well

i
was
a

tardy
drinking
this
it
sat
at

the
hops
have
held
up
well
fresh
this
may
have
a
more

still

as

i
drink
it
too
o
a
for
a

that
i
really
dont
like
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
try
it
even
if
you
dont
generally
like
belgian
style
ipas
definitely
try
it
if
you
do
pours
a
very
hazy
honey
golden

pretty
cloudy
smell
is
very
malty
chalky
and
lots
of
belgian

taste
is
about
the
same
somewhat
bitter
and
funky
lots
of
yeast
and
some
bitter
citrus
dominate
but
not
in
a
good
way
not
worth
the
price
another
tasty
brutal
beer
from
stillwater
id
go
as
far
as
calling
this
a
palate
wrecker
but
its
got
enough
character
to
keep
you
interested
while
your
tongue
takes
a
beating
well
worthy
your
coin
m
crisp
refreshing
sessionable
and
somewhat
unique
due
to
the
belgian
ipa
meeting
some
hops
dry
and
grassy
finish
o
certainly
not
a
bad
ale
but
it
could
use
some
tweaking
a
bold
belgian
ipa
above
average
of
their
native
counterparties
and
it
is
actually
mingled
in
the
saison
territory
overall
a
very
nice
first
impression
by
stillwater
here
an
easy
drinking
thirst
quenching
saisonbelgianipawhatever
with
nice
cohesion
between
the
yeast
and
the
hops
the
yeast
does
come
through
more
than
the
hops
but
it
all
works
together
rather
nicely
recommend
to
all
especially
when
the
warmer
weather
hits
o
very
nice
belgian
ipa
lots
of
complex
and
interesting
flavors
going
on
quite
enjoyable
o
this
is
great
stuff
an
aggressive
assault
of
hops
laid
in
a
valley
of
belgian
pale
glory
nice
an
earthy
with
citrus
bounty
extremely
drinkable
belgian
ipa
that
is
sure
to
please
o
as
usual
stillwater
delivers
a
pretty
tasty
beer
definitely
drinkable
o
good
but
nothing
special
worth
buying
solely
for
the
amazing
label
artwork
though
the
flavor
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
with
banana
lemon
citrus
pith
and
a
hoppy
bitterness
along
with
a
belgian
drying
theres
pepper
and
clove
spiciness
along
with
that
strong
phenolic
note
that
continues
pours
into
a
small

hazed
lemony

just
a

round
out
the
flavors
profile
not
bad
and
kinda
refreshingnot
over
the
top
with
the
yeast
wich
is
a
good
thing
in
my
opinion
what
a
strange
palate
of
flavors
where
this
beer
starts
with
clove
and
belgian
spicing
works
wonderfully
but
that
backside
of
plastic
smokey
char
earthiness
and
slight
aspirin
bitterness
do
not
finish
this
beer
well
at
all
a
very
nice
beer
but
very
similar
to
the
2
other
stillwater
beers
ive
had
so
farcellar
door
and
stateside
with
maybe
a
bit
more
hops
in
this
one
their
yeast
strain
seems
to
dominate
definatly
worth
a
try
o
my
favorite
stillwater
beer
thus
far
and
one
of
my
new
favorite
belgian
ipas
gives
le
freak
a
run
for
its
money
overall
a
really
enjoyable
and
complex
beer
my
big
gripe
with
this
beer
is
the
low
level
of
carbonation
if
this
beer
had
more
bubbles
to
open
the
palate
and
intensify
those
dry
musty
flavors
it
could
be
awesome
still
another
example
of
just
how
complex
drinkable
and
varied
belgian
ipas
can
be
loads
of
lemon
and
bright
assorted
citrus
on
the
palate
id
like
a
more
prominent
yeasty
component
but
this
is
still
some
tasty
and
quite
worthy
stuff
biting
herbal
and
fresh
tasting
hops
dry
out
the
party
in
your
mouth
tasty
and
delicious
go
get
some
and
enjoy
super
cool
label
is
a
bonus
im
not
a
lemon
fan
but
this
is
a
well
constructed
beer
the
balance
between
flavoring
and
bittering
hops
is
great
and
its
nice
to
see
some
variety
in
the
ipa
scene
not
your
typical
west
coast
ipa
this
would
be
s
great
lawnmower
beer
pours
a
murky
light
yelloworange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
small
chunks
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
chalk
and
citrus
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
yeast
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
american
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
o
a
nice
summer
drink
quite
true
to
the
belgian
golden
ale
style
but
with
an
american
level
hops
kick
overall
i
think
this
is
a
well
crafted
ipa
nothing
to
give
you
the
wow
factor
but
its
a
good
offering
from
stillwater
nice
job
overall
a
solid
spicy
belgian
ipa
it
has
good
bitterness
but
the
spice
and
funk
overwhelm
the
hop
flavors
o
a
very
nice
brew
belgian
ipa
or
hoppy
saison
who
cares
it
is
very
good
great
mash
up
beer
if
you
love
saisonsipas
then
definitely
give
this
a
try
overall
its
a
really
great
beer
its
really
interesting
and
the
hops
are
still
satisfying
and
noticeable
the
only
thing
that
would
make
it
better
for
me
is
if
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
bit
thicker
incredibly
welldone
overall
this
is
a
real
solid
beer
even
as
old
as
it
is
its
still
quite
enjoyable
overall
one
of
the
best
bottles
names
i
have
ever
seen
in
case
anyone
was
wondering
yes
the
3d
effects
do
actually
work
with
3d
goggles
on
not
my
favorite
beer
from
them
but
it
was
still
enjoyable
and
well
priced
for
the
product
i
think
i
have
seen
one
more
from
them
i
havent
tried
yet
from
their
colorado
shipment
so
far
im
very
happy
with
this
company
this
one
really
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
a
unique
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
a
nice
hoppy
saison
with
some
residual
bitterness
certainly
worth
trying
o
decent
ipa
but
different
you
can
tell
that
it
is
belgian
due
to
the
characteristic
spice
solid
mix
of
a
strong
flavorful
yeast
with
some
nice
hops
on
the
back
end
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
as
it
resembles
a
farmhouse
ale
yet
far
hoppier
and
filled
with
funky
belgian
yeast
that
adds
extra
complexity
to
the
mild
grain
base
im
seeing
more
beers
come
on
that
reach
this
level
of
quality
and
its
good
to
see
them
more
plentiful
than
ever
around
here
tasty
stuff
well
recommended
especially
on
tap
i
will
have
this
one
again
o
the
citrus
aromas
and
flavors
in
this
beer
seem
a
little
subdued
but
it
is
still
a
pleasant
drinking
ipa
o
this
is
quite
well
done
and
also
easily
consumable
pours
a
bubbling
unclear
straw
color
crowned
by
a
tall
loose
frothy
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
the
aroma
is
a
blend
of
hops
and
yeast
lemon
and
crushed
herbs
with
a
peppery
yeast
touch
and
a
bit
of
dried
banana
fresh
citrus
and
floral
hop
flavor
finishing
with
a
lingering
peppery
spice
just
a
little
pale
malt
sweetness
but
what
is
there
is
quite
tasty
spicy
crisp
and
lively
just
a
nice
fresh
hoppy
beer
with
a
properly
done
belgian
tilt
i
am
officially
a
fan
of
stillwater
light
body
with
tight
combination
and
a
stronger
hop
presence
than
the
nose
suggests
theres
a
dry
crisp
hop
bite
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
pale
malt
backbone
into
a
dry
finish
earthy
grassy
and
slightly
spicy
with
dry
piny
bitterness
and
subtle
citrus
zest
some
lemon
peel
character
before
finishing
with
biscuit
malt
bread
and
cracker
decent
balance
but
it
kind
of
falls
off
in
the
finish
kind
of
watery
and
bland
on
the
back
end
decent
hop
flavor
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
found
this
beer
a
bit
bland
i
guess
if
you
just
want
to
pound
an
easy
to
drink
aggressively
hopped
beer
this
old
be
appealing
but
i
found
it
kind
if
boring
o
nice
profile
spicy
light
and
dry
has
both
characteristics
of
a
bipa
and
saisonfarmhouse
its
highly
hopped
and
balanced
for
an
exceptional
beer
o
another
great
beer
from
stillwater
love
the
label
and
the
price
of
four
packs
this
is
a
balanced
mix
between
a
saison
and
an
ipa
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
o
very
good
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
with
some
hints
of
saison
nice
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
definitely
consider
picking
it
up
again
overall

0
as
mentioned
above
in
the
tasting
notes
this
was
a
good
beer
overall
with
some
good
to
great
qualities
but
it
wasnt
the
hop
bombsaisonbpa
fusion
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
still
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
its
clear
from
drinking
this
and
brian
has
a
vision
for
each
of
his
beers
and
exceptional
skill
and
ability
in
making
that
vision
a
reality
in
this
case
my
vision
of
what
this
beer
could
be
may
not
have
lined
up
perfectly
with
the
brewersbut
that
isnt
to
say
this
isnt
a
perfectly
good
beer
because
it
clearly
is
more
of
a
hoppy
saison
than
a
belgian
ipa
nitpicking
of
course
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
very
unconventional
the
artwork
is
really
cool
too
pours
a
light
cloudy
straw
color
still
see
through
but
some
sediment
in
suspension
over
an
inch
of
fluffy
white
suds
on
tap
rising
well
above
the
brim
of
my
pint
glass
the
nose
is
funky
like
some
of
their
other
saisons
smells
like
the
saison
yeast
i
used
in
my
homebrew
fruity
and
tart
with
a
floral
hop
profile
and
assured
bitterness
the
taste
agrees
completely
with
the
nose
this
is
a
saison
through
and
through
hoppy
but
only
on
the
back
end
i
expected
it
to
be
more
aggressively
done
and
a
pine
complex
would
work
well
here
although
all
i
really
get
is
a
floral
character
and
pronounced
bitterness
super
light
too
like
the
others
ive
had
from
stillwater
elegantly
malted
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
light
feel
plenty
drinkable
and
a
well
hidden
abv
another
fine
crafted
ale
from
these
guys
an
imperial
version
of
this
would
be
fun
odwasnt
in
love
with
this
one
not
aggressive
enough
for
me
more
along
the
lines
of
a
belgian
pale
than
a
belgian
ipa
in
my
opinion
why
cant
ibu
i
dont
know
why
cant
u
this
beer
has
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
some
trace
specs
of
faded
yellow
up
towards
the
sides
a
nice
bright
white
head
of
foam
up
top
with
some
vigor
and
sticking
power
a
slight
haze
throughout
the
liquid
looking
quite
nice
retention
is
there
for
a
kinda
low
abved
belgian
ipa
this
has
more
of
a
hoppy
scent
than
belgian
yeast
influence
i
get
some
lemon
orange
pine
and
earthy
scents
coming
out
instead
of
bready
yeasty
malt
the
musk
kinda
jumps
out
pretty
smelling
imo
but
i
do
get
some
perfume
scents
with
warming
a
very
straight
forward
ale
here
i
get
some
of
the
belgian
bready
yeast
up
front
with
some
hop
taste
not
your
normal
belgian
ipa
i
am
not
entirely
sure
if
this
is
classified
right
some
pineapple
notes
come
through
with
the
warming
not
getting
a
stitch
of
the
6
alcohol
which
is
quite
low
but
there
is
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
feel
is
between
light
and
medium
with
a
nice
felt
carb
going
for
it
not
my
favorite
beer
or
ipa
or
belgian
ipa
whatever
it
is
but
it
works
for
me
for
a
go
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
but
i
would
probably
get
bored
by
the
3rd
glass
edit
from
11212
tried
the
regular
draft
version
at
maxs
on
saturday
while
still
enjoyable
i
thought
the
draft
version
really
paled
in
comparison
to
the
cask
version
sampled
previously
probably
would
rate
the
regular
draft
version
a
straight
4
still
good
but
no
where
near
as
excellent
as
the
cask
version
had
this
on
nitro
while
in
l
a
overall
the
beer
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
it
appeared
a
hazy
darker
orange
color
that
had
a
really
nice
well
retained
thick
and
dense
white
head
lighter
aroma
than
expected
slight
citrus
hop
the
taste
is
about
what
you
would
expect
from
the
style
malty
with
some
citrus
hop
the
beer
had
a
really
nice
feel
to
it
extremely
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
nice
fruity
notes
of
citrus
hop
balanced
with
light
bodied
base
clean
finish
with
mild
hop
bitterness
while
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
it
fails
to
capture
the
true
greatness
that
mark
several
mostly
belgianbrewed
exemplars
of
the
style
balance
is
largely
missing
from
this
one
as
is
the
sweet
essence
of
belgian
yeast
which
can
sometimes
distinguish
the
style
from
a
typical
american
ipa
still
this
brew
is
worth
a
try
pretty
good
ipa
resembles
hop
stoopid
another
favorite
of
mine
smoother
than
some
other
ipas
doesnt
have
the
bite
of
ruination
however
ruination
is
my
favorite
by
the
way
i
will
definitely
be
getting
this
again
very
soon
good
golden
color
almost
perfectly
clear
ok
head
and
really
nice
clingy
lacing
that
hangs
on
for
dear
life
aroma
is
piney
with
a
good
amount
of
pineapple
and
some
orange
malt
sweetness
and
hops
balance
pretty
well
but
this
beer
is
a
little
more
subdued
than
i
would
have
expected
just
researched
and
realized
that
this
beer
has
been
in
the
bottle
for
4
months
still
a
good
ipa
but
i
would
guess
that
it
has
lost
a
little
during
its
time
in
the
bottle
overall
very
good
representation
of
this
style
and
very
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
will
be
getting
some
more
of
these
to
pass
around
the
4th
of
july
festivities
o
contrary
to
its
name
brainless
ipa
is
quite
thoughtout
indeed
showcasing
belgian
yeast
first
and
foremost
making
this
american
brew
a
belgianstyle
beer
first
and
an
ipa
second
but
the
combination
is
a
fantastic
one
fruity
and
spicy
yeast
esters
meld
wonderfully
with
the
hops
juicy
fruitiness
for
a
match
made
in
heaven
this
beats
all
80
of
the
previous
beers
i
have
rated
on
this
site
almost
perfectly
balanced
hops
yeast
and
malts
a
real
pleasure
and
sad
to
know
that
it
is
not
available
year
round
i
found
this
bomber
at
whole
foods
in
seattle
and
hope
i
can
find
some
more
before
seattle
runs
out
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
the
belgium
yeast
doesnt
overpower
the
fact
that
this
is
an
ipa
instead
it
balances
nicely
for
a
truly
unique
flavor
theres
no
mistaking
the
hops
finish
this
could
make
a
great
year
round
brew
unfortunately
the
availability
is
sparse
overall
this
is
ok
needs
more
depth
o
i
dont
sense
the
belgian
presence
in
this
but
either
way
its
a
sweet
yet
earthy
ipa
that
goes
down
pretty
easily
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
im
somewhat
intrigued
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
wish
there
were
more
belgian
characteristics
but
just
as
an
ipa
it
is
really
good
i
would
have
again
yet
another
very
good
beer
by
epic
great
thick
foamy
head
tight
bubles
that
last
not
the
quarter
inch
type
that
fade
away
in
30
seconds
held
to
the
light
its
not
haxy
just
dark
gold
in
appearance
aroma
is
good
if
a
little
mild
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
carbonation
has
good
balance
the
hop
selection
is
interesting
some
pine
finishing
with
a
hint
of
citrus
not
overly
bitter
a
tad
more
than
i
would
normally
like
but
no
complaints
here
i
think
the
slight
aftertaste
may
be
from
the
yeast
not
bad
at
all
just
different
the
belgian
characteristics
are
mild
and
most
evident
in
the
yeast
flavors
very
good
and
will
buy
again
this
is
a
beer
to
savor
and
enjoy
not
one
for
nonchalant
drinking
nights
would
make
an
interesting
pairing
with
a
sharp
cheese
and
possibly
italian
pasta
i
can
really
see
this
complimenting
the
flavors
of
garlic
and
oregano
not
as
good
as
their
spiral
jetty
imho
but
a
fine
beer
that
deserves
a
good
try
overall
i
would
not
have
known
this
was
a
bipa
had
the
label
not
said
so
this
has
been
in
the
bottle
for
100
days
or
so
but
it
actually
has
held
up
quite
well
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
stronger
in
the
belgian
department
excited
to
try
some
other
styles
from
epic
a
very
tasty
very
easy
drinking
belgian
ipa
lots
of
flavor
complexities
all
wrapped
up
in
a
nicely
balanced
body
everything
melds
together
just
right
o
good
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
theres
definitely
better
tropicalcitrusy
ipas
but
theres
also
many
that
are
not
as
good
id
have
it
again
o
very
enjoyable
a
great
session
its
complex
without
having
to
think
about
it
smooth
with
a
ton
of
pine
and
earth
88
like
all
epic
beers
from
this
series
and
beyond
the
use
of
hops
in
this
beer
is
expert
it
pours
a
fantastic
bright
golden
color
with
some
darker
orange
hues
and
a
massive
fluff
white
head
the
nose
on
it
is
distinctly
belgian
yeast
floral
and
supercharged
complimenting
the
ripe
citrus
hop
profile
of
this
beer
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
nose
with
the
hop
presence
carrying
throughout
the
whole
beer
moving
from
lemony
to
bitter
very
quickly
and
the
summer
yeast
keeping
everything
dancing
the
grain
bill
is
light
but
has
a
graham
crackery
honey
sweetness
to
it
that
works
well
with
the
other
players
the
feel
is
outstanding
too
with
electric
carbonation
prickling
the
palate
and
a
drinkably
medium
body
working
the
finish
is
bitter
and
yeasty
as
it
should
be
in
a
belgian
ipa
this
to
me
is
another
genre
definer
from
epic
everything
you
want
in
the
style
and
nothing
you
dont
it
should
be
in
a
museum
somewhere
for
that
reason
too
many
lousy
versions
out
there
this
one
struck
a
chord
with
me

very
well

with
only
a
slight

noticed
after
the

overall
this
is
a
very

ipa
good
balance
of

and
yeast

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
for
the
most
part
i
think
i
have
liked
epics
beers
more
than
most
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
slightly
hazed
burnt
orange
with
a
large
fluffy
white
crown
that
left
two
broken
rings
of
lace
behind
as
it
settled
very
slowly
into
a
frothy
mass
aromas
of
overripe
tropical
fruits
and
light
phenolsthere
is
a
little
herbal
and
resinous
note
that
get
bigger
as
i
drink
more
as
well
flavors
of
the
before
mentioned
tropical
fruits
with
some
toasted
grain
and
some
mildly
spicy
phenols
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
the
flavors
are
not
bad
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
bottleworks
in
san
diego
where
they
have
a
nice
selection
of
epic
beers
this
is
a
really
nice
fruity
citrusy
belgian
ipa
i
was
very
impressed
its
got
a
great
hop
character
and
overall
flavor
as
well
as
great
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
yeast
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
that
a
cask
presentation
is
optimal
for
this
beer
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
dry
sticky
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
belgian
yeast
and
pale
malts
into
a
bone
dry
finish
earthy
resinous
and
bitter
with
lots
of
dry
hop
flavor
followed
by
subtle
sweetness
with
some
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
however
the
citrustropical
fruit
character
isnt
as
strong
as
the
nose
suggests
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
are
stronger
than
they
were
in
the
aroma
with
hints
of
bread
apple
pear
and
bubblegum
sweet
malt
backbone
balances
things
out
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
along
with
bread
biscuit
and
graham
cracker
subtle
heat
in
the
finish
but
it
doesnt
affect
the
drinkability
overall
this
beer
isnt
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
but
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
from
epic
the
hop
flavors
are
decent
but
are
slightly
one
dimensional
and
overpower
the
belgian
yeast
notes
a
but
too
much
for
me
still
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
and
got
through
the
bomber
pretty
quickly
od
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
belgian
ipa
style
really
well
done
a
bit
filling
certainly
hefty
on
its
belgian
spiciness
overall
really
tasty
well
worth
a
try
aftertaste
is
slightly
boozy
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
i
suppose
i
was
a
little
harsh

overall
looks
nice
and
smells
okay
but
flavor
and
mouthfeel
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
aside
from
the
amount
of
carbonation
there
is
little
else
to
consider
this
a
belgian
no
sweetness
and
no
softness
usually
accompanying
the
use
of
belgian
yeast
tramp
stamp
has
a
glimmering
look
of
golden
copper
topped
with
a
tall
fizzy
white
head
a
deliciously
sweet
aroma
delights
my
nose
with
apricot
grapefruit
and
honeysuckle
aspects
to
it
the
flavor
ultimately
boils
down
to
exactly
what
it
sets
out
to
achieve
an
accessible
and
harmonious
marriage
of
an
american
ipa
and
a
belgian
golden
ale
i
never
thought
it
could
be
possible
to
make
hallmarks
of
a
belgian
beer
for
the
general
beer
lover
i
have
always
imagined
myself
as
unique
in
falling
in
love
with
strong
flavors
of
belgian
yeast
and
fruit
esters
as
a
gateway
to
good
beer
it
seems
like
an
acquired
taste
second
to
the
more
approachable
ipas
but
this
beer
combines
the
two
effortlessly
and
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
i
see
this
as
being
a
huge
hit
at
bars
and
parties
for
all
demographics
in
the
beer
world
overall
theres
a
hint
of
unpleasantness
in
its
flavor
profile
that
keeps
me
from
loving
it
a
good
ipa
and
shall
be
purchased
again
was
just
okay
for
me
average
beer
had
it
on
tap
very
complex
brew
this
bottle
is
about
6
months
old
but
still
has
great
hop
presence
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
pour
with
white
clingy
head
this
is
a
good
looking
brew
smells
of
citrus
pine
and
some
esters
mouth
watering
flavor
is
malt
and
biscuit
with
some
of
the
citrusy
hop
but
not
very
bitter
almost
sweet
in
a
way
smooth
mouthfeel
and
clean
finish
ill
be
buying
more
soon
overall
an
enjoyable
belgian
ipa
on
all
fronts
the
only
minor
knock
would
be
to
increase
the
belgian
yeast
taste
clove
banana
but
that
is
a
very
minor
adjustment
needed
in
this
one
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
these
guys
offerings
a
dry
and
tasty
belgian
style
ipa
hints
of
citrus
followed
by
a
grassy
flavor
this
will
get
my
appetite
going
later
tonight
pours
a
pale
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
is
full
of
hops
in
front
but
with
some
sweet
fruits
and
spices
like
banana
and
clove
on
the
end
the
taste
was
very
nice
with
a
lot
of
citrus
and
grass
flavors
up
front
from
the
hops
and
a
very
clean
finish
from
the
malt
on
the
finish
not
bad
and
not
too
expensive
ill
probably
be
picking
this
one
up
again

that
where

overall
this
beer
is
well
crafted
but
theres
a
hint
of

in
its
flavor
profile
that
keeps
me
from
loving
it
it
has
a
lot
going
on
but
its
not
all
perfectly
executed

nice
beer

slightly

i
must

this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
truly
strikes
the
balance
between
american

belgian

the

ample
pine
resin
like
a
strong
american
ipa
moderate
of
body
and
quite
highly
carbonated
which
is
maybe
not
a
selling
point
regardless
i
am
converted
could
be
my
favorite
clown
shoes
to
date
a
pleasant
enough
belgian
ipa
the
yeast
and
the
sassy
west
coast
ipaworthy
hops
both
clashing
and
working
together
at
different
times
in
the
life
cycle
of
this
brew
uselessly
provocative
name
aside
i
gotta
say
i
kinda
liked
this
one
insomuch
as
this
continues
to
be
one
of
my
least
favourite
styles
definitely
a
solid
brew
but
not
my
favorite
from
clown
shoes
well
worth
grabbing
but
dont
expect
a
light
or
refreshing
brew
as
this
is
far
from
it
a
hazy
orange
color
some
lacing
lingers
around
the
glass
a
little
head
that
quickly
fades
to
leave
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
whole
way
down
s
citrus
like
smell
i
get
a
slight
sour
smell
almost
hidden
t
slight
grapefruit
not
too
bitter
for
an
ipa
get
a
little
of
that
belgian
yeast
taste
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
but
not
overpowering
tastes
like
it
smells
m
a
slight
spice
feel
to
it
little
bit
of
sour
near
the
end
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
on
the
dry
side
o
not
bad
at
all
this
style
is
quickly
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
worth
a
sixer
for
sure
interesting
name
and
label
o
really
nice
beer
here
you
have
a
fantastic
balance
of
hops
and
orangecitrus
zest
some
malt
characters
but
a
solid
offering
for
a
belgian
ipa
not
too
sweet
but
not
too
bitter
either
this
is
a
solid
beer
an
incredibly
good
beer
plenty
of
bitterness
citrus
flavours
with
a
solid
tropical
fruit
backing
that
was
great
this
one
is
a
much
try
from
clown
shoes
im
already
looking
forward
to
picking
it
up
again
sometime
soon
if
i
can
this
tastes
like
an
ipa
but
calling
it
a
belgium
anything
is
quite
a
stretch
it
looks
ok
smells
like
an
ipa
and
tastes
like
one
too
i
dont
pick
up
any
yeast
phenolics
or
spicyness
rjt
o
very
good
beer
from
a
very
good
brewer
wow
factor
was
missing
so
i
could
not
move
into
the
outstanding
range
but
i
would
revisit
this
beer
a
weak
belgian
beginning
to
the
taste
followed
by
an
unbalanced
tartbitter
after
taste
the
smell
was
pretty
faint
and
didnt
really
help
the
beer
much
the
mouthfeel
was
probably
the
strongest
feature
of
this
beer
but
thats
only
if
you
can
ignore
the
aftertaste
maybe
a
belgian
ipa
just
isnt
for
me
overall
ill
have
to
try
more
belgian
ipas
maybe
i
dont
like
the
style
but
north
coast
pranqster
is
a
go
to
beer
for
me
and
thats
a
belgian
strong
ale
according
to
my
review
score
and
memory
i
gave
ale
asylum
bedlam
a
better
rating
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
out
but
im
glad
it
was
a
single
not
awful
but
not
my
thing
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
one
out
this
was
my
first
from
clown
shoes
this
was
a
miss
for
me
but
ill
give
them
a
couple
more
shots
that
pecan
pie
bomber
sure
sounds
enticing
fluffy
head
dimples
deeply
in
a
few
spots
pretty
much
bone
white
tight
weave
overall
with
good
retention
the
lacing
comes
in
thick
stripes
tends
to
move
like
flexible
metal
mesh
bright
vibrant
orange
colored
liquid
inclines
more
to
redbrown
than
yellow
very
clear
and
crisp
looking
you
see
a
fat
bubble
here
or
there
from
a
distance
the
nose
is
powerfully
floral
yet
as
you
get
closer
more
dominance
in
the
well
cooked
bread
dough
herbaceousness
sharper
spices
and
pepper
moderate
pine
sap
and
likewise
the
peach
nectarine
scents
are
quiet
takes
a
little
opening
up
but
there
is
a
decent
bubblegum
component
mediumbodied
plus
foams
up
some
in
the
mouth
carbonation
big
rather
than
prickly
as
a
result
it
sits
there
and
slowly
percolates
rather
than
flows
spicy
attack
ginger
cardamom
caraway
then
spiced
orange
peel
not
getting
a
consistent
yeast
presence
here
too
the
peach
apricot
pear
apple
flavors
have
minimal
thrust
ending
up
in
a
drier
texture
the
bitterness
not
fully
to
be
pinned
on
the
herbaceousness
more
like
sour
grains
pine
more
present
the
bubblegum
to
banana
notes
mostly
retronasal
than
perceived
as
flavor
its
actually
pretty
good
and
can
easily
be
understood
as
a
smashup
of
two
styles
o
with
craft
beer
so
prominent
and
progressive
today
this
is
nothing
short
of
average
at
best
small
chance
id
buy
it
again
so
did
the
booze
although
i
couldnt
taste
it
this
felt
stronger
than
it
was
in
actuality
which
was
a
testament
to
the
ipa
in
this
beer
while
not
the
best
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
there
was
enough
t
like
here
and
the
body
was
more
than
sufficient
to
tie
everything
in
together
while
not
memorable
this
had
the
staying
power
of
a
tramp
stamp
without
the
accompanying
tackiness
worth
a
go
once
for
anyone
who
likes
this
style
or
a
hoppy
beer
that
has
the
characteristics
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
or
ipa
the
aftertaste
is
also
robust
you
dont
forget
it
too
soon
overall
it
is
a
good
effort
from
the
clown
people
overall
definitely
the
best
belgian
india
pale
ale
i
have
had
to
date
fantastically
complex
and
less
awkward
than
some
others
another
well
done
to
clown
shoes
great
pricing
too
particularly
for
a
high
abv
import
j
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
brew
lots
of
flavor
to
the
beer
and
could
pose
a
challenge
to
ipa
drinkers
not
fond
of
belgian
styles
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
probably
towards
the
average
range
for
the
style
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
is
the
same
yeast
as
the
muffin
top
with
a
slightly
downgraded
grain
bill
delicious
o
im
a
fan
of
belgian
ipas
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
sure
ive
had
a
few
that
were
better
but
ive
also
had
much
worse
i
would
definitely
have
again
overall
its
ok
the
flavors
work
well
enough
and
i
feel
like
it
would
be
a
good
choice
poolside
on
a
hot
day
however
the
disappointing
mouthfeel
means
ill
most
likely
bypass
it
more
often
than
not
deep
copper
orange
in
color
with
a
deep
haze
that
lifted
a
bit
as
this
warmed
poured
with
a

that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap

yeast
caramel
malt
tropical
citrus
and
pineapple
aromas

with

an

with
well

without
much

very
nice

not
overwhelming
or
too
intense
but
definitely
plenty
of
belgian
characteristics
and
hoppiness
present
attractive
orangeamber

but
below
average
head
and
lacing
on
my
pour
not
quite
as
full
or
complex
as
could
be
but
a
tasty
beer
id
drink
again
ounderwhelmed
unfortunately
want
to
try
other
clown
shoes
this
left
a
little
disappointed
onice
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
nice
flavor
othis
beer
was
good
but
the
spice
and
hop
kick
was
too
strong
for
me
to
give
this
a
better
grade
overall
a
decent
offering
wish
it
had
more
bitter
hop
notes
then
being
as
sweet
as
it
is
its
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
id
want
to
have
all
the
time
worth
a
drink
poured
out
of
the
bottle
a
nice
ambery
tan
cloudy
with
a
gradient
hoppy
smell
is
big
and
pleasant
tastes
clean
not
overly
bitter
not
filling
floral
bright
and
hoppy
very
drinkable
could
easily
be
a
session
for
me
pairs
well
with
bar
food
worst
part
is
the
bottle
design
o
fairly
decent
clown
shoes
usually
comes
up
with
some
winners
this
is
a
belgian
ipa
that
is
on
par
with
most
american
interpretations
its
straight
forward
and
well
crafted
they
nailed
the
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
delicious
aroma
and
taste
highly
recommended
surprised
that
it
isnt
currently
rated
above
90
o
interesting
style
that
is
worth
trying
very
good
belgian
ipa
that
i
could
easily
enjoy
again
and
again
from
my
tasting
notes
the
beer
poured
an
opaque
orange
that
persisted
throughout
my
tasting
the
aroma
had
the
signature
belgian
yeasts
with
a
bit
of
hop
which
is
true
to
the
style
the
taste
started
with
the
sweet
belgian
flavors
that
gave
way
to
the
bitter
hops
on
the
back
end
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
it
was
a
great
beer
that
was
true
to
the
style
and
was
a
great
introduction
to
clown
shoes
i
will
definitely
be
trying
more
of
their
beers
in
the
future

very

little

sweetness
to
back
it
up
this
was
an
easy
fdrinking
belgian
ipa
but
not
what
i
would
expect
out
of
that
style
of
beer
i
would
drink
again
o
i
think
brews
like
this
are
a
great
advance
in
perfecting
the
belgianipas
however
this
beer
was
confusing
the
belgian
and
ipa
styles
were
not
harmonically
blended
this
brew
seemed
to
be
working
against
itself
rather
than
harmoniously
working
together
it
was
mild
on
the
hops
the
belgian
style
the
everything
all
in
all
it
definitely
is
an
average
beer
to
me
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
when
it
comes
to
these
belgian
style
american
brewed
hybrid
witipas
i
keep
wanting
more
orange
and
coriander
cleanly
brewed
with
no
offflavors
and
pretty
well
balanced
though
well
brewed
overall
should
appeal
to
anyone
who
likes
the
idea
of
a
hoppy

generic
very

this
pours
a
golden

there
is

out
as

but
finishes
with
that
classic

very
interesting
and
well
made

definitely

had

in

nicebheadbon
this
beer
with
a
mild
lacing
had
a
mild
floral
smell
with
hints
of
caramel
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
it
has
a
great
balance
of
malt
with
a
great
blast
of
hops
not
overwhelming
just
balanced
healthy
carbonation
throughout
made
it
a
quality
drink
throughout
very
good
beer
nothing
offputting
or
offensive
with
this
one
but
its
largely
forgettable
theres
just
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
and
theres
nothing
really
new
or
exciting
happening
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
whenever
youre
in
the
position
to
purchase
this
theres
likely
something
equally
or
more
enjoyable
that
will
be
available
as
well
no
real
redeeming
qualities
but
not
bad
by
any
means
overall
a
pretty
decent
offering
from
clown
shoes
not
something
i
would
rush
to
the
store
for
but
cetainly
would
not
turn
down
if
offered
the
taste
is
sweet
upfront
followed
by
some
bubble
gum
and
yeast
notes
and
finishing
off
with
a
nice
pine
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
smooth
leaves
a
little
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
show
off
the
style
quite
well
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
had
enough
belgian
yeast
aspects
and
hoppy
aspects
to
represent
the
style
nicely
and
i
thought
the
slight
bit
of
funk
in
the
yeast
worked
really
well
and
it
helped
make
this
beer
a
little
unique
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
not
filling
a
little
refreshing
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
couple
of
these
especially
on
a
nice
summer
day
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
appearance
they
were
both
pretty
good
with
the
aroma
being
my
favorite
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
hop
profile
in
the
aroma
wasnt
more
similar
to
the
taste
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
this
style
it
does
a
good
job
of
representing
the
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
belgian
ipas
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
it
made
for
a
good
first
impression
of
clown
shoes
it
was
just
an
all
around
nice
beer
and
i
will
for
sure
be
checking
out
more
of
their
beers
good
job
guys
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable

on
top
the
retention
is
thin
but
the
lacing
looks
really
nice
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
earthy
some
subtle
latex
aromas
as
well
the
taste
has
more
of
a
latex
flavor
earthy
malt
comes
through
pretty
strong
there
is
a
subtle
orange
flavor
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
smooth
overall
its
a
little
disappointing
it
had
potential
but
it
just
doesnt
hit
the
right
notes
too
much
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
style
solid
use
of
spicy
yeast
and
hops
with
a
good
balance
an
enjoyable
ipa
good
twist
and
balance
o
a
well
made
tasty
bipa
does
it
match
the
best
no
but
a
single
is
an
easy
choice
something
to
buy
again
though
the
label
is
quite
tacky
overall
a
great
tasting
beer
with
layers
of
recognizable
characteristics
and
without
the
over
the
top
hoppiness
that
makes
you
want
to
switch
to
another
beer
pours
a
murky
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
swaths
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
earth
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
yeast
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
citrus
zest
and
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
yeast
and
spice
presence
is
pretty
intense
in
this
one
would
happily
drink
again
o
somebody
put
this
in
a
sixpack
im
in
love
i
havent
had
a
brewery
excite
me
this
much
since
i
started
digging
into
anchorage
brewing
and
thats
saying
a
hell
of
a
lot
believe
me
the
blaecorn
unidragon
in
my
fridge
just
keeps
looking
better
and
better
o
this
is
not
a
bipa
for
me
the
style
should
have
far
more
candied
sugar
and
belgian
yeast
qualities
and
be
balanced
this
is
a
hop
driven
beer
that
could
pass
for
an
apa
or
ipa
the
original
style
was
developed
by
belgian
breweries
and
was
distinctly
different
to
traditional
ipas
nonetheless
a
very
nice
beer
in
its
own
right
had
to
mark
down
because
of
the
style
an
excellent
brew
from
start
to
finish
this
brew
had
a
hopper
profile
then
what
i
was
expecting
which
really
suprised
me
very
good
flavors
of
grassy
hops
and
pretty
much
what
i
wrote
above
still
very
bitter
and
dry
throughout
and
in
the
finish
im
lowering
my
mouthfeel
a
notch
this
is
more
rough
than
delicious
for
me
amber

a
unrepentant
blanket
of
dense

obscure
the
glassware
very
very
nice
oranges
and
more
oranges
on
the
nose
sure
they
smell
like
theyve
gone
over
but
its
quite
a
rich
melange
just
so
also
is
that
soy
or
salt
or
possibly
earl
gray
not
sure
but
its
a
very
intriguing
combo
taste
is
similar

i
added
a
student
this
past
week
named
tawny
and
for
now
she
seems
to
be
dominating
my
beers
this
one
looked
like
the
top
of
a
softserve
vanilla
ice
cream
cone
by
the
time
that
i
was
done
tawny
rocky
and
with
great
retention
it
really
slowed
me
down
fall
dang
you
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
and
loads
of
co2
bubbles
in
evidence
nose
had
a
bitter
citrusy
mustiness
as
though
they
had
commingled
all
of
the
ingredients
above
so
as
not
to
overwhelm
one
or
the
other
i
call
it
a
truth
in
advertising
and
b
just
what
i
like
i
am
tiring
of
hearing
people
that
do
not
like
hoppy
bitter
ipas
moan
about
the
current
dearth
of
malty
beers
yo
hops
is
what
sells
currently
move
on
this
was
nice
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
the
taste
was
superb
it
had
a
tealike
characteristic
that
reminded
me
of
orange
pekoe
orange
and
black
powder
plus
must
wow
i
remember
my
pops
oneskillet
chun
king
meals
with
orange
pekoe
tea
when
i
was
a
child
and
this
really
took
me
back
man
but
pops
could
cook
i
was
totally
inspired
by
him
in
high
school
and
took
four
semesters
of
homeec
foods
finish
was
semidry
offset
by
the
sweet
orange
peel
and
if
you
think
that
i
could
not
perceive
it
think
again
i
remember
that
one
of
the
criteria
for
overall
asked
if
you
got
your
s
worth
in
this
case
for
six
bone
for
a
bomber
the
answer
is
hell
yeah
nice
beer
would
buy
again
d
a
promising
belgian
ipa
to
start
with
nice
appearance
and
aroma
before
quickly
turning
average
at
best
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
prove
to
be
a
bit
of
a
let
down
the
overall
result
is
an
average
at
best
ale
that
i
would
neither
recommend
nor
seek
out
again
though
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
again
like
an
actual
tramp
try
to
enjoy
once
and
then
kick
it
to
the
curb
o
overall
a
good
show
of
hops
though
when
i
think
belgian
ipa
i
think
a
sharp
spiciness
and
some
belgian
yeasty
character
which
this
lagged
a
bit
behind
enough
so
to
garnish
just
good
regards
taste
hops
hit
you
right
up
front
and
reveal
a
bit
of
the
orange
peel
taste
that
the
label
describes
this
is
a
belgianstyle
ipa
but
it
just
doesnt
handle
the
synthesis
of
the
spiced
fruit
hop
notes
with
the
malts
in
a
good
fashion
instead
you
get
a
bit
of
a
mishmash
of
the
two
fighting
against
each
other
for
a
bit
of
an
undefined
taste
finishes
pretty
smooth
with
a
bit
of
coffeeish
malts
on
the
back
a
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
make
this
quite
nice
note
as
this
warmed
up
the
clovish
spices
coalesced
with
the
malts
in
a
much
more
unified
way
and
gave
rise
to
a
much
better
taste
serve
this
slightly
above
the
recommended
4045
degrees
f
for
maximum
taste
tasty
but
nothing
exemplary
now
this
is
much
more
in
tune
with
my
preferences
than
muffin
top
was
its
a
straightforward
belgian
ipa
with
good
sweetnessbitteryeast
phenol
three
way
balance
right
in
my
personal
sweet
spot
if
anything
im
only
really
disappointed
by
the
slight
lightness
of
body
and
im
being
rather
nitpicky
about
that
the
head
could
also
be
a
bit
more
stable
but
its
got
a
great
sense
of
just
the
right
amount
of
herbal
pine
citrus
hopping
and
phenols
to
accent
a
nice
bready
caramel
malt
into
something
better
than
most
of
the
usual
domestically
produced
bipas
for
sale
in
my
local
market
absolutely
no
boozey
burn
either
check
this
one
out
if
you
can
o
honestly
have
to
say
that
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
style
ipa
of
all
time
i
have
not
ran
into
one
that
had
a
hop
profile
like
this
brew
this
beer
showed
some
creativity
and
finesse
with
its
execution
really
impressed
with
clown
shoes
with
this
beer
i
will
buy
more
of
their
expensive
bottles
if
they
are
this
good
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
good
bitterness
sweetness
for
balance
and
some
spice
to
make
things
even
more
interesting
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
bottled
on
812
this
pours
a
cloudy
mid
brown
color
with
a
midlarge
off
white
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
and
keep
a
finger
thick
retention
the
smells
are
nice
you
get
a
load
of
pine
and
floral
hops
with
a
nice
sweet
caramel
ending
a
little
funk
and
some
other
belgian
yeast
esters
like
banana
and
bubblegum
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
excellent
a
highly
bitter
load
of
hops
but
a
little
yeast
esters
and
caramel
to
attempt
to
balance
out
hazy
golden
body
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
lace
is
pleasing
enough
aroma
brings
bright
citrues
and
bready
belgian
yeastiness
as
does
the
flavor
i
love
this
style
and
the
breweries
that
do
it
right
clown
shoes
does
this
style
right
this
is
in
my
personal
top
5
maybe
top
3
of
belgian
ipas
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
juicy
citric
fruity
hops
and
doughy
bready
belgian
yeastiness
nice
little
accent
of
belgian
yeast
spice
as
well
nicely
carbonated
and
mediumfull

2nd
beer
from

2nd
winner
o
a
solid
belgian
ipa
that
borders
on
being
a
little
too
bitter
but
is
constrained
a
bit
by
the
nice
malts
and
fairly
reserved
in
terms
of
flavor
profile
belgian
yeast
abv
is
just
right
and
makes
this
bomber
a
perfect
serving
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
middleground
belgian

look
no
further
love
the

it

a

with

notes
belgian
spicing
is
faint
and
overwhelmed
by
the
ipa
character
but
the
hop
and
malt
combination
hold
their
own
the
belgian
elements
are
subdued
but
do
give
this
an
interesting
offbeat
flavor
that
works
well
medium
bodied
with
some
creaminess
mouth
feel
is
enhanced
by
active
carbonation
an
interesting
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
the
labelling
didnt
bode
well
for
a
serious
belgian
ipa
but
the
contents
worked
out
well
overall
for
what
i
paid
its
well
worth
it
and
could
see
myself
trying
other
clown
shoes
beers
a
very
well
done
belgium
ipa
m
light
to
medium
body
good
carbonation
o
this
one
had
all
the
components
i
look
for
in
a
belgian
ipa
great
blend
of
belgian
flavors
and
hops
make
for
a
great
summer
beer
at
5
a
bomber
this
is
one
i
will
definitely
get
again
this
is
distinctly
belgian
in
aroma
and
flavor
but
the
hop
character
is
tremendous
and
forward
its
citrusy
and
floral
with
notes
of
grapefruit
and
faint
melon
its
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
flavorful
its
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
weird
one
the
belgian
characteristics
are
kind
of
weak
but
the
are
present
in
sufficient
quantity
to
really
screw
with
the
hop
profile
the
yeast
flavors
are
harsh
and
excessively
phenolic
which
only
serves
to
highlight
the
harshness
of
the
hops
and
really
clashes
with
the
pine
and
grapefruit
notes
to
me
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
so
many
people
seem
to
dislike
belgian
ipas
no
thought
put
into
how
the
hops
and
yeast
work
together
and
an
apparent
lack
of
understanding
of
how
to
deal
with
belgian
yeast
you
shouldnt
try
brewing
a
belgian
ipa
unless
you
are
already
capable
of
brewing
a
very
good
tripel
overall
a
lot
hoppier
than
i
like
my
belgian
ipas
this
takes
away
from
the
complexity
as
the
hops
sort
of
run
together
in
the
middle
and
finish
o
pretty
good
this
is
a
nice
spicy
and
citrus
laden
beer
but
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
originally
reviewed

o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
surprisingly
complex
quite
hoppy
bordering
on
a
normal
ipa
love
the
biscuit
in
the
aftertaste
nothing
earthshattering
just
a
solid
and
tasty
belgian
ipa
this
leans
more
towards
a
regular
vs
a
belgian
ipa
this
whole
asprin
thing
is
too
off
putting
for
me
to
even
consider
trying
this
one
again
o
very
good
belgian
ipa
from
excellent
local
brewery
hmmmm
an
interesting
ipa
although
i
cant
say
i
ever
really
warmed
to
it
probably
would
not
order
again

not
a

with

some
sweet

taste
follows
the
nose
with
some
characteristics
of
a
typical
ipa
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
but
with
a
funky
finish
that
has
a
vegetable
earthy
feel
strange
but
i
am
game
mouth
is
medium
with
some
carbonation
it
is
nicely
bitter
not
overly
and
relatively
smooth
given
the
funky
taste
glad
i
tried
this
odd
but
neat
brew
o
a
bit
of
a
strange
ipa
pretty
refreshing
and
flavorful
interesting
and
worth
a
try
this
lovely
lady
deserves
better
than
to
be
called

thats
for
trashy

poor

this
is
the
somewhat

you
in

harping
about
them
hazy

with
a
pale
yellow
fingers
worth

which
built
up
thicker
along
the
sides
expected
more

than
i
got
bready
hops
underlie
pine
and
earthy
spice
a
hint
of
citrus
as
well
this
goes
for
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
as
they
are
identical
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
and
spoton
body
for
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
how
the
yeasts
added
phenols
that
played
well
with
the
hops
nicely
executed
mouthfeel
is
pretty
clean
but
the
hop
resins
are
oppressive
wont
get
this
one
again
o
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
quite
easy
to
drink
i
have
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
now
both
on
tap
and
in
bottles
and
i
would
likely
get
this
one
again
i
really
like
the
balance
to
this
beer
especially
in
the
flavor
t
starts
with
some
sticky
citrus
and
orange
notes
a
heavy
malt
flavor
kicks
in
with
some
belgian
yeast
a
bit
too
sweet
and
heavy
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
an
absolute
blessing
complex
and
gives
you
little

of
everything
you

fruit
esters
taste
followed
the
aroma
with
a
decent
kick
of
bready
yeast
citrus
zest
peach
and
pear
a
bit
rubbery
with
notes
of
peppery
spice
tree
sap
and
floral
hops
medium
body
a
bit
chewy
decent
overall
though
i
prefer
this
style
to
be
a
bit
lighter
in
body
with
a
crisper
hop
profile
but
thats
just
me
o
nice
belgian
stlye
ipa
and
so
many
to
chose
ffrom
this
is
a
beer
i
would
go
back
to
for
this
style
d
cant
get
enough
really
perfect
balance
never
too
phenolic
ultimately
it
does
lose
flair
on
warming
but
the
hops
still
shine
through
in
a
wonderful
way
a
true
belgo
interpretation
of
an
american
ipa
with
mild
heat
recommend
for
bipa
naysayers
o
belgian
ipas
are
typically
not
my
style
but
this
is
right
up
my
alley
this
is
a
good
ipa
with
the
slightest
hint
of
belgian
influence
sometimes
two
great
styles
dont
blend
well
but
in
this
case
it
does
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
thus
far
overall
good
for
the
style
but
i
am
still
learning
to
like
bspas
and
i
hope
to
try
more
beers
from
this
brewery
tramp
stamp
has
a
dark
orange
look
to
it
with
some
amber
thrown
in
as
well
a
small
amount
of
white
stuff
with
minor
stick
smell
is
of
grassy
hops
fruity
esters
some
belgian
yeast
and
trace
pine
this
is
a
hop
forward
belgian
ipa
with
the
belgian
yeast
taking
a
backseat
the
hop
comes
off
grassy
bitter
and
floral
with
small
fruity
taste
in
the
middle
followed
by
some
sweet
malts
kind
of
all
over
the
place
for
me
feel
is
a
bold
medium
with
a
nice
ample
carb
not
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
overall
a
very
good
belgian
ipa
that
has
some
bite
to
it
this
is
a
sipper
the
earthiness
comes
out
as
it
warms
and
that
is
my
favorite
part
of
this
would
not
rush
out
for
it
but
i
would
get
it
again
if
i
desired
something
hoppy
overall
another
nice
addition
into
the
bipa
family
of
beers
in
the
world
love
the
citrus
this
beer
gives
off
and
will
be
having
more
of
this
in
the
future
pours
a
very
nice
hazy
dark
golden
amber
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
onefinger
plus
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
and
leaves
some
very
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
yeasty
very
nice
hop
notes
very
slight
citrus
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
very
nice
hop
note
some
citrus
medium
body
with
a
nice
slightly
drybitter
finish
another
very
tasty
brew
from
cs
thanks
bill
overall
good
choice
would
have
again
bottled
811
sampled
on
february
2
2012
it
has
a
pretty
typical
ipa
pur
with
a
mediumamber
color
and
a
lot
of
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
bountiful
with
floral
hops
orange
peel
and
a
breadlike
character
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
but
the
texture
is
smooth
the
taste
makes
you
realize
it
is
an
ipa
with
its
powerfully
bitter
hops
along
with
the
citrusorange
note
and
clean
finish
got
to
love
it
the
name
is
testament
to
a
timehonored
american
tradition
and
the
chick
actually
has
a
beer
bottle
tattoo
popping
over
those
lowrise
jeans
im
keeping
the
bottle
nice
rich
amber
appearance
great
head
retention
pretty
good
yeasty
citrus
smell
the
taste
is
good
too
once
you
get
past
the
stinging
hops
which
try
to
overpower
things
a
little
there
is
a
nice
undercurrent
of
flavors
normally
associated
with
a
wheat
beer
banana
clove
yeast
etc
on
account
of
this
it
feels
and
tastes
great
in
the
mouth
but
once
you
down
it
the
hops
come
back
with
a
vengeance
nevertheless
i
enjoy
and
recommend
this
look
forward
to
trying
more
clown
shoes
stuff
overall
the
appearance
and
aromas
are
extremely
enticing
unfortunately
the
flavours
are
almost
asking
me
to
go
away
extremely
bitter
and
just
not
in
the
good
way
serving
type
bottle
this
pours
a
tanstraw
color
with
a
light
amount
of
foam
theres
a
grassypiney
hop
aroma
and
flavor
to
it
the
grassy
piney
hop
flavor
comes
across
sharp
as
knives
or
tattoo
needlesin
my
notes
i
wrote
sharp
three
timesbut
its
matched
by
a
floral
hoppiness
from
the
belgian
yeasty
esters
this
gives
the
flavor
some
fruit
spiciness
and
a
floral
hoppy
pungent
flavor
that
finishes
strong
mouthfeel
is
fine
mediumhigh
carbonation
with
a
fairly
crisp
finish
fairly
refreshing
although
perhaps
a
bit
boozy
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
a
favorite
of
mine
if
the
idea
of
mixing
an
ipa
and
a
bspa
together
appeals
to
you
its
certainly
worth
giving
it
a
shot
yet
to
be
impressed
by
clown
shoes
this
beer
is
a
medium
golden
brown
color
with
amber
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
nice
white
head
full
and
stable
the
aroma
has
a
spicy
hop
character
woody
piney
and
a
little
earthy
its
a
bit
malty
underneath
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
yeast
the
taste
is
balanced
bitterness
in
the
midtaste
and
a
little
sweetness
up
front
malt
is
firm
theres
a
belgian
yeast
flavor
that
gives
some
phenolic
angle
to
the
beer
its
interesting
and
very
enjoyable
full
and
firm
in
body
i
enjoyed
this
pretty
obvious
why
this
one
couldve
been
better
more
belgian
yeast
character
they
advertise
it
as
a
belgian
ipa
yet
the
belgian
part
seems
lacking
but
as
an
ipa
especially
one
modeled
on
the
southern
california
variety
hey
its
great
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
hazy
orange
pour
above
average
white
head
light
lacing
the
arom
has
lots
of
citrus
good
amount
of
pine
very
hoppy
lots
of
citrus
finishes
pleasantly
bitter
the
body
is
medium
good
carbonation
a
very
good
ipa
nice
blend
of
hops
the
belgian
notes
are
kinda
light
taste
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
belgian
ipa
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
enjoyed
it
from
beginning
to
end
above
average
example
of
the
style
it
bothers
me
that
on
the
front
of
the
bottle
it
says
ale
brewed
with
natural
flavor
what
is
this
a
soda
bomber
from
half
time
poured
a
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
lasting
amber
head
aromas
of
biscuit
yeast
orange
zest
grapefruit
and
light
earthiness
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
flavors
of
biscuit
yeast
orange
zest
grapefruit
and
light
pine
with
a
crisp
dry
bitter
lingering
citrus
finish
the
beer
looked
pumpkin
colored
with
a
thick
three
finger
thick
head
that
looked
very
creamy
the
aroma
was
a
mix
of
sour
cherries
orange
peel
and
grapefruit
the
taste
was
dominated
by
the
bittering
hops
followed
by
a
floral
rosewater
like
flavor
there
was
a
touch
of
lemony
sourness
as
well
very
refreshing
and
light
feel
and
a
tart
finish
the
approachable
nature
made
this
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
strong
aroma
is
yeasty
and
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
apple
it
pours
a
luscious
dark
golden
amber
with
a
nice
if
not
persistent
pale
golden
tan
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
flavor
is
fairly
hoppy
although
quite
fruity
more
belgian
than
ipa
but
still
tasty
smooth
texture
has
average
body
and
a
fair
amount
of
fizz
overall
not
outstanding
but
still
worthy
i
dont
find
the
belgian
influence
to
be
huge
and
as
an
ipa
its
only
fair
to
middlin
mouthfeel
is
a
little
more
in
the
ipa
zone
then
the
taste
the
hops
present
themselves
here
in
the
form
of
bitterness
and
pucker
smooth
with
a
mild
body
and
carbonation
making
it
a
vey
drinkable
beer
the
finish
does
have
an
excessive
dry
almost
powdery
feeling
that
doesnt
compliment
well
but
all
in
all
its
a
fine
brew
the
tramp
stamp
is
solid
and
one
id
buy
again
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
a
hoppy
alpha
hops
american
ipa
and
a
yeasty
belgian
style
ipa
i
tatse
a
range
of
flavors
from
bread
dough
to
kiwi
fantastic
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
for
an
ipa
i
personally
dont
get
a
monstrous
belgian
yeast
character
so
it
is
a
little
disappointing
in
that
respect
because
you
could
almost
call
it
a
bottleconditioned
ipa
and
i
would
think
the
same
of
it
if
you
are
a
hophead
you
will
love
this
if
belgian
pales
are
your
thing
this
may
be
a
bit
to
american
for
your
taste
o
despite
all
of
the
hops
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
so
that
the
bitterness
and
citrusy
flavors
are
not
overpowering
pours
a
nice
bright
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
has
nice
ipa
hops
bright
and
piney
with
a
touch
of
yeasty
spiciness
in
the
background
the
taste
hits
you
at
first
with
an
assertive
bitterness
that
lingers
with
some
citrus
fruits
and
some
more
of
that
yeasty
spiciness
finishes
on
the
dry
side
with
medium
carbonation
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
is
not
going
to
blow
you
out
of
the
water
with
anything
crazy
but
it
is
very
well
executed
and
drinkable
poured
a
reddishbrown
with
onefinger
head
that
died
quicky
but
left
some
lace
patches
on
top
of
a
mostly
piney
citric
aroma
along
with
some
caramel
sugary
malt
a
thinnish
light
body
goes
down
smooth
the
citric
hops
along
w
spice
are
prevelant
and
quite
tasty
however
the
belgian
yeast
strain
and
orange
notes
as
well
as
some
candi
sugar
sweetness
typical
in
belgians
are
minimal
yet
i
still
pick
up
a
touch
of
tartplush
fruit
that
is
typical
of
some
light
belgians
this
is
more
ipa
than
belgian
with
some
of
the
sweetness
muted
but
still
a
good
balance
only
criticism
is
that
the
finish
has
a
slightly
funky
offsetting
spiciness
that
i
wish
was
a
little
more
crisp
and
muted
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
to
drink
while
the
hops
are
great
i
would
have
preferred
to
see
the
yeast
play
a
slightly
bigger
role
this
has
its
moments
at
times
i
sat
here
and
thought
it
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
from
an
american
brewery
and
other
times
the
exact
opposite
all
in
all
this
is
well
above
average
albeit
a
bit
of
a
mess
o
this
is
another
solid
drinkable
beer
overall
a
fairly
competent
belgian
ipa
o
not
the
most
assertivelyhopped
belgian
ipa
to
hit
the
market
in
recent
years
but
rather
tramp
stamp
is
a
hopcentric
belgian
pale
ale
unfiltered
and
quite
drinkable
even
at
7
abv
o
ehh
not
a
great
beer
but
decent
doesnt
really
wow
me
o
not
doing
it
for
me
a
real
cloudy
tan
amber
color
with
a
big
fuzzy
white
cloud
on
top
and
thick
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
brings
out
a
delicate
clovepinelemon
hop
with
a
pleasant
caramel
malt
base
the
tongue
gets
a
goodly
dose
of
lemon
clove
and
yeasty
nutmeg
spice
really
nice
with
a
medium
body
and
a
fizzy
fullness
that
goes
down
comfortably
easy
drinking
with
a
very
universally
likeable
clove
hop
blend
nice
job
cs
o
what
an
unexpectedly
awesome
beer
i
must
say
that
given
the
name
of
the
brewery
goofy
and
the
name
of
the
beer
gimmicky
i
was
expecting
something
notsogood
but
the
bipa
is
just
about
my
favorite
style
and
these
guys
just
about
nailed
it
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beer
kudos
drinkability
overall
this
beer
is
really
easy
drinking
but
not
the
most
flavorful
beligium
ipa
ive
ever
tasted
ive
really
become
a
big
fan
of
belgium
ipas
over
the
years
and
i
feel
like
this
one
needs
a
bit
more
of
the
belgium
influence
its
good
but
definitely
could
be
better
thanks
much
kevin
overall
very
easy
to
consume
this
one
as
it
refreshes
and
quenches
ones
thirst
very
enjoyable
beer

give
me
a
good

this

is

on
the

not

at
all
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
goldorange
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
pine
and
floral
hops
belgian
yeast
is
noticeable
but
now
what
i
would
call
strong
flavor
of
pale
malts
grass
and
floral
hops
the
bitterness
increases
as
the
beer
warms
to
be
the
primary
profile
of
the
beer
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
the
belgian
character
really
is
very
subdued
compared
with
other
belgian
ipas
that
i
have
had
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
it
is
different
a
nice
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
was
gone
pretty
quicklywith
a
longer
lasting
head
i
would
have
gave
it
a
higher
scorei
really
like
the
color
and
clarity
to
the
beer
bigtime
amarillo
hop
aromassharp
and
citric
they
really
burst
out
at
yalight
phenols
and
even
lighter
bready
malt
round
out
the
aroma
profile
the
yeast
plays
a
bigger
role
on
the
palatespiced
and
warming
the
phenols
overshadow
the
citric
hops
a
little
but
its
still
quite
good
another
good
offering
i
have
tried
from
clown
shoesand
the
write
up
on
the
label
is
spot
on
o
pretty
good
belgian
ipa
from
america
but
i
think
there
are
some
better
out
there
such
at
stones
calibelgique
overall
was
pretty
excited
about
this
one
after
reading
about
it
but
this
missed
the
mark
for
me
not
well
balanced
and
bad
aspirin
aftertaste
avail
now
in
tx
rotation
might
try
on
tap
to
see
if
any
better
but
one
in
bottle
is
enough
for
me
no
od
a
really
nice
belgian
ipa
fruity
hoppy
and
not
too
boozy
well
crafted
and
easy
to
drink
really
solid
overall
a
very
taste
brew
that
seems
to
taste
more
like
an
american
ipa
than
a
belgian
one
still
i
enjoyed
the
entire
bottle
and
would
pick
it
up
again
if
i
saw
it
worth
trying
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
dry
hop
presence
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
into
a
bone
dry
finish
lots
of
sticky
earthy
pine
flavor
providing
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
that
is
countered
by
the
estery
yeast
and
citrus
fruit
notes
hints
of
pepper
and
coriander
along
with
mango
pineapple
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
sweetness
balanced
out
drybitter
notes
nicely
subtle
alcohol
in
the
finish
malt
backbone
is
faint
letting
hops
and
belgian
yeast
shine
pretty
quaffable
with
decently
masked
abv
a
well
made
bipa
but
a
bit
heavy
handed
on
the
american
hops
i
like
the
belgian
aspects
of
the
beer
but
the
hops
really
do
a
number
to
a
fairly
delicate
style
this
has
an
overriding
pepper
and
belgian
yeast
character
with
just
subtle
earthy
hop
notes
and
some
fruity
esters
there
isnt
much
to
gripe
about
here
even
if
its
fairly
straightforward
well
done
overall
when
poured
into
a
glass
this
beer
had
a
very
appealing
rusty
orange
coloring
it
flowed
brilliantly
from
the
bottle
with
little
to
no
head
and
carbonation
was
just
right
the
aroma
of
citrus
is
very
delightful
and
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
sugary
or
i
would
have
rated
alot
higher
the
beer
will
leave
a
slight
impression
on
your
tongue
but
other
than
that
i
really
liked
trying
a
new
beer
from
a
company
i
have
never
heard
of
not
a
bad
first
impression
from
clown
shoes
i
would
like
to
see
what
else
they
have
later
on
o
a
solid
belgian
style
but
didnt
stand
out
as
something
i
should
try
again
not
as
jaw
dropping
as
other
clown
shoes
beers
overall
very
well
done
22oz
is
a
lot
of
this
beer
as
heavy
as
it
is
m
clean
crisp
wellbalanced

the

it

of
draws
you

some

mf
is
medium

over

however
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
pick
it
up
again
overall
a
solid
beer
good
interpretation
of
the
style
o
very
solid
beer
nice
hop
flavors
with
great
balance

it

medium
mouthfeel
and
creamy
through
and
through
despite
the
boldness
of
each
individual
note
this
one
is
a
full
on
drinker
due
to
the
consummate
fusion
of
all
its
elements
the
palate
feels
nicely
carbonated
and
bitter
from
start
to
finish
the
malts
dont
do
a
whole
lot
to
balance
out
teh
flavor
of
this
beer
dont
even
put
belgian
before
the
ipa
nice
to
sip
bitter
beer
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
i
have
to
say
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
the
only
beer
ive
had
from
clown
shoes
prior
to
this
was
the
pecan
pie
porter
which
was
tasty
but
much
too
sweet
i
love
the
inclusion
of
the
chops
mixed
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
to
bounce
different
flavors
off
of
each
other
a
tad
bitter
but
that
is
a
small
complaint
to
file
when
looking
at
what
the
rest
of
the
beer
has
to
offer
overall
very
good
beer
overall
despite
all
the
controversy
surrounding
this
beer
and
other
clown
shoes
releases
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
id
recommend
this
one
especially
to
hopheads
o
overall
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
more
offerings
from
these
guys
well
worth
picking
up

served
in

the

honey

a

fresh
wet
piney

you
drink
there
is
a

characteristics
the

very
hoppy
with
a
drying

to
it
good

and
good

tasty
brew
o
i
really
like
this
belgian
ipa
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
regularly
overallstones
calibelguque
is
the
only
other
belgian
ipa
i
can
think
of
that
i
can
get
for
this
price
and
i
think
this
was
a
buck
cheaper
at
5
99
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
as
well
i
can
see
this
beer
being
a
go
to
beer
for
me
too
bad
no

medium
body
well
carbonated
wet
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
drinkable
ipa
and
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
after
belgian
beer
fest
this
weekend
although
i
didnt
get
a
great
deal
of
belgian
in
this
o
at
first
i
really
wasnt
digging
this
beer
but
as
it
opened
up
a
little
and
my
palate
had
some
time
to
adjust
it
definitely
grew
on
me
o
i
really
enjoyed
tramp
stamp
as
i
have
most
belgian
ipas
though
not
excellent
still
recommended
i
would
have
again
o
smells
nice
but
thats
about
it
no
more
for
me
decent
and
enjoyable
for
the
most
part
it
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
for
what
ever
reason
i
think
it
is
a
combination
of
the
really
unattractive
look
and
the
bitterness
that
continues
to
build
with
each
sip
pours
pale
amber
to
dark
gold
decent
white
head
then
receds
to
little
rim
nose
is
big
tangerine
maybe
some
kumkwat
palate
is
big
tangerine
grapefruit
kumkwat
and
general
hoppy
bitterness
some
wild
yeastyestery
flavors
too
light
malt
to
balance
finish
is
more
tangerine
kumkwat
o
overall
rather
impressed
by
this
one
nice
belgian
ipa
a
bit
heavy
and
thick
and
syrupy
for
the
style
but
that
doesnt
seem
to
take
much
away
from
it
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
the
beer
looks
and
smells
fantastic
but
the
taste
falls
a
little
short
for
me
dont
get
me
wrong
i
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
the
bomber
but
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
to
pick
it
up
again
skal
o
this
has
a
full
flavor
of
dried
out
old
oranges
but
not
really
in
a
bad
way
with
some
pithy
green
characters
the
hops
are
not
bad
but
there
is
nothing
to
support
them
the
malt
is
hidden
and
the
belgian
yeast
character
is
just
not
there
overall
i
confess
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
belgian
ipas
love
ipa
love
belgian
beers
but
the
style
always
seems
contrived
to
me
more
marketing
than
substance
ill
finish
the
bomber
without
any
drama
but
dont
think
ill
be
back
for
another
o
a
good
beer
overall
overall
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
this
one
out
maybe
if
i
found
out
it
was
an
old
bottle
i
would
try
a
fresh
one
but
i
honestly
wasnt
that
impressed
excellent
choice
for
the
hop
lover
serving
type
bottle
othis
is
a
complex
brew
one
thing
i
have
noticed
after
trying
two
clown
shoes
beersthey
really
nail
the
smell
of
the
beer
and
the
taste
both
of
the
ones
i
have
tried
have
wonderful
noses
and
heavy
flavor
22oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
amber
color
there
was
a
very
small
offwhite
head
that
dropped
away
rather
quickly
it
leaves
no
lacing
nice
nose
getting
some
citrus
and
pine
hop
notes
also
some
spiciness
and
maybe
even
a
faint
breadiness
to
it
the
taste
is
quite
good
hops
are
there
but
not
overdone
citrus
and
pine
some
spiciness
but
faint
also
just
a
bit
of
the
breadiness
that
you
get
from
the
belgian
yeasts
but
ever
so
slight
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
what
we
found
most
interesting
about
this
brew
was
how
much
it
felt
like
a
wheat
beer
it
had
big
coriander
and
spice
but
had
robust
hops
which
were
surprisingly
much
more
present
in
the
taste
than
in
the
nose
this
beer
ultimately
was
not
necessarily
100
true
to
its
style
but
it
certainly
pushed
the
envelope
and
made
for
a
very
tasty
treat
o
goes
down
easy
quite
tasty
not
too
filling
nice
kick
nice
representation
of
style
clown
shoes
continues
to
bring
it
this
one
pours
a
nice
honey
gold
in
color
with
moderate
turbidity
and
a
light
white
lacing
around
my
snifter
the
nose
is
dominated
by
a
nice
belgian
yeast
with
sweet
undertones
some
citrus
perhaps
and
finishes
with
an
ultimately
light
hop
characteristic
it
smells
just
like
i
like
my
belgian
ipas
it
tastes
of
sweet
bananaesque
yeast
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
accompanied
by
a
moderate
amount
of
spice
it
has
really
nice
flavor
and
is
a
lot
more
bitter
and
dry
than
i
anticipated
its
right
on
point
for
how
i
like
the
style
it
drinks
pretty
smoothly
and
is
in
between
light
and
medium
in
body
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
may
have
catapulted
itself
right
behind
stones
calibelgique
to
be
one
of
my
alltime
top
belgian
ipas
well
done
clown
shoes
the
taste
is
very
nice
the
carbonation
instantly
fills
the
mouth
sweet
malt
enter
and
then
as
the
carbonation
subsides
citrus
hops
and
a
slight
yeast
at
the
finish
is
a
slight
bitterness
very
nice
clown
shoes
did
a
great
job
parsing
out
the
flavors
in
this
belgiantinged
ipa
its
easy
to
let
a
products
controversial
branding
affect
your
judgment
but
clearer
heads
can
look
past
the
marketing
immature
names
and
labels
should
not
offend
bad
beer
should
whats
inside
the
bottle
is
much
more
important
than
whats
on
it
and
in
that
regard
clown
shoes
has
nothing
to
worry
about
first
clown
shoes

and
it
didnt
disappoint
split
a
22
oz
bomber
with
my
friend
over
a
tombstone
pizza
while
watching
the
steelerseagels
preseason
game
i
hadnt
read
the
description
of
the
beer
on
here
or
on
the
bottle
prior
to
drinking
this
it
poured
a
beautiful
largely
translucentopaque
orange
with
a
decent
head
accompanied
by
an
abundance
of
lacing
that
has
some
real
staying
power
beautiful
beautiful
hop
aroma
on
the
approach
when
i
got
my
first
taste
the
first
thing
i
though
was
saison
with
a
strong
hop
profile
well
its
not
a
saison
but
the
hops
are
front
and
center
wonderful
citrusy
piney
grapefruity
taste
with
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
i
love
this
beer
im
glad
i
was
able
to
procure
some
of
this
in
a
couple
trades
wish
it
was
distributed

philly

comes
through
one
of
the
best
belgianstyled
ipas
ive
had
overall
its
ok
nothing
i
would
run
out
and
get
again
but
not
bad
either
very
nice
where
the
beer
is
strong
it
works
very
well
a
bit
more
alcohol
punch
would
have
been
good
but
it
is
not
enough
to
get
upset
about
in
fact
there
is
nothing
about
this
beer
or
brewer
to
get
upset
about
pours
a
murky
orange
with
tons
of
foamy
whte
head
looks
typical
of
a
belgian
beer
smells
yeasty
and
subtly
hoppy
leaves
something
to
be
desired
tastes
great
lote
of
hops
floral
yeasts
a
solidnbut
subtle
malt
backbone
well
carbonated
overall
a
verybsolid
representation
of
the
style
anid
much
better
than
i
anticipated
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
o
although
belgian
ipas
tend
to
be
a
bit
weak
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
example
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
overall
pretty
solid
no
complaints
here
i
could
use
a
hint
of
sweet
in
this
just
a
tad
otherwise
it
is
a
great
beer
like
a
mix
of
double
ipa
and
other
belgian
styles
d
very
smooth
rich
but
not
too
complex
easy
drink
overall
o
this
is
a
really
good
belgian
ipa
im
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
this
one
from
clown
shoes
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
nose
lacks
a
lot
of
complexity
im
mainly
smelling
some
sweet
candi
sugar
bubblegum
and
grapefruit
hops
flavors
follow
the
nose
closely
its
a
fairly
typical
belgian
ipa
just
with
a
rather
pronounced
grapefruit
hop
flavor
nothing
too
special
moderately
creamy
mouthfeel
with
crisp
carbonation
and
a
moderately
dry
finish
not
a
bad
brew
overall
but
not
something
i
find
particularly
memorable
i
do
like
the
label
though
really
nice
citrus
flavors
going
on
and
just
enough
belgisn
yeast
influence
clown
shoes
knows
how
its
done
the
mouthfeel
is
great
with
a
brisk
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
thirstquenching
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinker
overall
this
is
easily
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
had
most
of
the
belgian
ipas
ive
had
let
the
belgian
part
far
outweigh
the
ipa
part
to
the
point
where
they
might
as
well
just
be
a
tripel
this
ones
different
and
amazing
highly
recommended
i
loved
everything
about
this
beer
the
name
label
art
smell
taste
everything
a
perfect
mix
of
american
ipa
and
belgian
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
i
will
definetly
be
heading
back
to
the
store
to
stock
up
on
more
tramp
stamp
do
i
split
this
bomber
but
wouldve
had
no
problem
taking
down
it
in
its
entirety
quite
drinkable
every
sip
left
my
mouth
watering
for
more
highly
recommended
if
you
like
your
belgian
yeastcitrus
hops
combos
od
i
like
it
what
a
tasty
treat
this
beer
satisfies
in
a
way
that
one
hasnt
in
awhile
try
it
or
try
it
again
o
good
beer
overall
the
belgian
portion
is
more
pronounced
than
the
american
ipa
part
overall
i
like
the
belgium
beers
but
i
love
ipas
and
this
to
me
is
a
great
representation
of
the
styles
cool
bottle
art
and
at
5
99
a
bomber
this
was
a
steal
glad
i
tried
it
and
will
buy
again
my
first
clown
shoes
did
not
let
me
down
the
first
nasty
bite
if
youre
a
hophead
looking
for
something
different
give
the
tramp
stamp
a
try
o
highly
recommended
this
one
drinkability
this
beer
is
badass
much
to
my
surprise
i
really
enjoyed
tramp
stamp
though
i
usually
prefer
ipas
and
dipas
with
80
ibus
tramp
stamp
is
a
great
mix
between
two
great
styles
d
overall
tramp
stamp
is
a
really
solid
beer
that
is
worth
picking
up
recommended
o
overall
a
good
beer
it
smells
greata
perfect
mix
of
belgian
and
ipa
influences
however
the
flavors
are
much
more
ipaforward
with
only
a
little
influence
from
the
belgian
characteristics
still
its
quite
nice
overall
this
is
a
style
i
really
enjoy
for
the
balance
and
juxtaposition
of
flavors
but
this
really
just
came
up
short
for
me
this
beer
has
a
darkish
almost
burnt
orange
color
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
large
offcream
head
to
it
the
smell
is
heavy
on
the
citrus
with
a
cloudy
unfiltered
component
to
the
beer
tastewise
the
orange
peel
is
very
prominent
and
fills
the
mouth
along
with
a
very
bold
hoppyness
that
pinches
your
tongue
and
then
the
malt
flavoring
lingers
onto
the
next
sip
this
is
one
of
the
best
summeresque
belgian
pale
ales
that
ive
had
the
privilege
to
taste
and
share
with
others
overall
it
was
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
with
a
great
label
rock
on
clown
shoes
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
thanks
jared
and
chad
for
suggesting
it
im
definitely
going
to
get
more
and
would
recommend
this
to
others
a
must
try
o
i
like
it
a
lot
one
of
the
better
belgian
yeast
mixed
with
bold
west
coast
ipa
hop
bitterness
that
ive
had
many
many
brewers
cant
pull
this
off
imho
but
clown
shoes
did
d
definitely
a
good
drink
just
more
on
the
hop
side
than
the
belgian
side
the
cpj
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
small
citrus
and
a
hint
of
candy
sugar
in
the
taste
citrus
hops
and
sweet
candy
sugar
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
orange
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
sweet
but
nice
orange
citrus
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
really
odd
bitterness
at
the
back
moderate
sweet
throughout
creamy
in
the
mouthfeel
mildly
dry
finish
it
is
a
mishmash
of
flavors
but
overall
a
decent
belgian
ipa
ive
had
a
lot
of
belgian
ipas
and
this
one
is
pretty
good
definitely
an
ipa
definitely
a
belgian
ale
yeast
beer
i
liked
it
i
would
even
have
it
again
finally
trying
out
these
newtous
clown
shows
brews
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
tawny
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
zest
very
light
leek
clove
banana
ruby
red
grapefruit
cantaloupe
and
lemon
zest
the
taste
holds
notes
of
orange
rind
lemon
peel
light
pine
black
pepper
banana
honeydew
and
white
bread
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
an
almost
grainy
feel
and
an
almost
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bipa
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
seems
a
bit
too
light
and
fluffy
but
it
is
damn
good
beyond
that
an
interesting
cross
between
a
wit
and
an
ipa
belgian
ipa
seems
a
little
bit
of
a
misnomer
but
close
enough
another
surprisingly
good
brew
from
clown
shoes
i
am
finding
that
i
am
liking
the
style
and
this
is
a
good
representative
of
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
changes
if
they
grow
into
their
own
brewery
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
carapils
and
crystal
malts
the
hop
aroma
is
excellent
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
piney
and
citrus
hops
along
with
a
dry
and
fruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
its
smooth
going
down
with
a
good
deal
of
bitterness
the
malts
provide
adequate
balance
and
complexity
the
yeast
esters
are
present
and
add
a
nice
dry
finish
with
a
some
added
fruitiness
there
is
a
touch
of
orange
peel
character
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
well
brewed
belgian
style
ipa
its
complex
and
easy
drinking
d
this
had
a
great
scent
but
the
flavor
wasnt
as
potent
nice
body
and
no
alcohol
noticeable
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
an
enjoyable
belgian
ipa
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
since
the
taste
was
muted
and
the
yeast
character
wasnt
as
pronounced
as
i
would
prefer
i
dont
find
this
very
drinkable
it
starts
out
pretty
well
but
they
bitter
profile
is
just
too
overwhelming
to
the
other
flavors
if
you
like
the
hoppier
end
of
the
belgianinfluenced
styles
this
is
one
to
try
overall
i
will
now
seek
this
beer
out
as
much
as
i
can
it
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
i
highly
recommend
overall
a
decent
belgian
ipa
a
little
more
malt
there
than
i
would
expect
for
the
style
worth
a
pint
but
not
something
i
would
get
again
it
definatly
has
its
place
in
the
clown
shoes
line
up
o
clown
shoes
tramp
stamp
isnt
the
best
brew
in
their
repertoire
but
for
the
style
its
not
half
bad
yet
another
intense
americanized
interpretation
of
a
classic
style
by
the
folks
at
clown
shoes
i
could
stand
more
yeast
byproducts
this
brew
with
a
lachouffe
strain
would
be
remarkable
pours
a
nice
dark
orange
with
a
bright
tope
head
good
lace
very
orange
nose
especially
for
a
belgian
in
the
middle
is
alcohol
a
little
yeast
and
some
pine
smells
pretty
good
not
a
belgian
nose
though
the
taste
is
not
good
theres
all
the
yeast
i
was
expecting
basically
belgian
yeast
and
chemical
resin
mixed
together
right
components
just
tastes
terrible
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
an
interesting
and
decent
beer
but
the
candied
sugary
flavor
was
a
little
too
dominating
for
me
things
just
didnt
come
together
as
well
as
i
hoped
for
it
it
was
still
a
pretty
flavorful
and
decent
beer
overall
though
d
the
name
is
childish
and
stupid
and
the
finish
needs
softening
but
there
is
something
that
could
be
really
good
here
not
very
much
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
here
too
i
would
prefer
more
of
the
typical
belgian
effervescence
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
ts
but
was
let
down
by
the
subpar
feel
and
underperforming
flavor
o
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
my
first
clown
shoes
experience
i
dont
know
if
ill
grab
another
anytime
soon
as
i
have
other
favorites
in
the
same
category
but
i
am
kind
of
curious
to
see
how
this
would
age
considering
the
prominent
yeast
character
d
more
ipa
than
belgian
but
still
tasty
o
i
continue
to
be
impressed
with
the
unique
and
creative
offerings
from
clown
shoes
as
a
primarily
ipa
drinker
this
style
is
a
natural
addition
to
my
arsenal
i
am
normally
weary
of
aggressive
fruit
flavors
in
my
beer
but
clown
shoes
proves
it
can
be
an
effective
technique
when
balanced
with
enough
hops
malts
and
spices
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
with
tongue
prickling
carbonation
d
tramp
stamp
is
a
spicy
bipa
that
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
was
hoping
for
somw
stronger
belgian
characteristics
but
this
was
still
enjoyable
overall
pretty
good
a
nice
bipa
only
thing
i
would
like
to
improve
on
it
is
less
belgain
and
more
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
full
flavored
and
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
lots
of
hops
but
plenty
of
belgian
characteristics
too
odat
first
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
flavor
i
was
ready
to
give
this
beer
a
low
mark
over
the
course
of
the
bomber
i
have
warmed
up
to
the
flavor
a
few
sips
have
allowed
me
to
become
accustomed
to
the
taste
once
accustomed
i
was
able
to
more
clearly
identify
the
flavors
all
in
all
i
like
the
beer
i
do
not
love
it
i
could
see
myself
paying
to
get
another
bomber
of
this
just
to
finalize
my
opinion
of
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
belgian
ipa
i
think
it
would
benefit
from
leaving
out
the
orange
peel
i
just
dont
think
it
ever
adds
anything
good
o
another
killer
clown
shoes
beer
excellent
bitterprickly
spice
hops
and
citrus
peel
blast
niiiice
o
a
real
nice
beer
tempted
to
give
it
a
5
overall
though
i
find
myself
slowing
down
with
it
halfway
through
pretty
good
bubble
gum
just
a
bit
to
much
which
affects
the
drinkability

the
overall
outweighs
the
individual
components
for

the

becoming

o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
was
put
off
by
the
strong
hops
aroma
because
i
was
expecting
a
tripel
but
the
beer
is
complex
and
interesting
a
good
mix
of
us
ipa
and
belgian
characteristics
this
poured
a
nice
translucent
copper
colour
with
a
thick
white
head
which
turn
a
creamy
mousse
like
the
extensive
bubbles
created
a
almost
fire
like
quality
when
held
up
to
the
light
an
nice
citrus
happiness
to
the
smell
along
with
some
light
grassiness
there
is
a
definite
malty
sweetness
to
really
balance
out
the
nose
wow
the
malt
really
comes
forward
in
the
mouth
that
doesnt
mean
there
is
no
hops
like
youd
expect
in
a
tripel
ipa
just
not
the
punch
in
the
face
you
might
expect
and
that
grassiness
sticks
around
in
the
mouth
with
almost
a
honey
sweetness
as
well
that
alcohol
warmness
youd
expect
from
a
10
5
abv
is
there
but
not
in
mouth
burning
way
awesome
beverage
a
very
well
balanced
ipa
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
say
this
is
not
for
me
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
more
of
a
stout
guy
so
maybe
im
not
being
fair
on
my
rating
this
ale
surprised
me
i
didnt
expect
such
goodness
with
their
attempt
at
a
style
twisted
hybrid
first
off
its
a
beautiful
beer
the
look
is
a
rich
murky
amber
with
a
thick
tight
froth
from
a
moderate
pour
cracking
the
bomber
emits
very
nice
aromas
rich
pine
trees
sweet
citrus
background
of
dates
and
funk
yup
a
mix
of
ipa
and
belgian
flavors
are
still
good
if
not
quite
as
appealing
as
the
smells
immediate
hit
is
that
of
a
quality
ipa
followed
by
an
almost
clashing
belgian
style
to
me
more
of
a
dubbel
and
then
drifting
into
a
strong
dipalike
fade
individually
the
flavors
are
all
of
apparently
high
quality
im
just
not
convinced
the
flavors
match
so
well
side
by
side
mouthfeel
is
excellent
with
just
the
right
carbonation
to
match
the
ipa
backbone
overall
a
very
good
beer
id
buy
it
again
for
those
clown
shoes
brews
that
are
mediocre
this
one
definitely
stands
quite
a
bit
higher
imo
o
if
you
are
expecting
an
ipatrippel
merger
you
will
be
disappointed
it
is
far
sweeter
than
any
of
those
have
a
right
to
be
despite
that
i
really
enjoyed
it
would
never
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
and
even
more
than
about
12
oz
is
an
ask
but
a
truly
unique
flavour
would
wish
for
the
hops
to
be
more
prominent
and
the
yeast
to
be
more
authentically
belgian
if
that
makes
sense
but
would
still
drink
again
not
at
all
what
i
expected
poured
a
gorgeous
extremely
hazy
orangeish
color
with
a
nice
rocky
offwhite
head
tasted
wonderfully
citrus
tangerinelike
with
a
touch
of
clove
very
good
flavor
i
drank
one
that
was
a
little
over
a
year
old
so
not
sure
how
much
of
the
flavor
can
be
attributed
to
that
oops
nice
tripel
bought
this
with
hopes
itd
be
a
great
combo
of
my
two
favorite
beer
styles
but
its
not
that
great
lacks
the
smell
i
hoped
for
and
doesnt
taste
at
all
like
a
belgian
tripel
mainly
just
boozy
high
alcohol
content
taste
o
clown
shoes
is
theoretically
a
very
good
brewing
company
and
when
executed
correctly
the
belgian
ipa
is
my
favorite
style
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
is
a
belgian
tripelipa
which
i
perceive
as
a
hybrid
between
american
ipa
and
tripel
which
is
much
different
than
an
intensely
hopped
bspa
saison
or
tripel
there
is
way
too
much
sugary
sweetness
to
this
brew
and
the
hopbelgian
blend
is
just
executed
poorly
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
brew
but
i
am
very
disappointed
bomber

the

a
marriage
of

in
their
arsenal
and
they
arent
afraid
to
use
it
if
in
the
mood
this
is
great
stuff
although
i
became
satiated
rather
quickly
and
was
pleased
to
share
with
some
buddies
one
of
whom
could
not
get
past
the
initial
sip
while
the
other
described
some
flavor
notes
like
orange

tea
indeed
recalls
an
unsweetened
orangelemon

covered
with
coriander
and
cardamom
seeds
body
on
the
thick
side
of
moderate
a
tad
chewy
and
reasonably
smooth
carbonation
quite
bold
and
this
enhances
the
sour
citric
effect
i
think
i
prefer
the
less
citric
tramp
stamp
but
this
is
well
worth
sampling
if
one
is
addicted
to
belgian
ipas
or
the
spicier
tripels
tried
this
at
the
weekend
i
was
at
the
brewdog
bar
in
shoreditch
and
brought
a
bottle
of
this
to
take
home
another
fine
example
of
those
crazy
american
ipas
full
bodied
with
incredible
malty
sweetness
then
a
tsunami
of
hop
explosion
across
the
palatte
the
sweetness
reminded
me
of
the
belgian
tripel
karmeliet
great
beer
would
definately
drink
it
again
the
taste
is
about
what
the
aroma
predicts
it
will
be
with
a
definite
grapefruit
citrus
character
floral
and
pine
and
a
lesser
malt
sensation
that
almost
tends
to
outlast
the
hops
on
the
finish

my
sense
of
smell
is
not
at
100
today
but
this
really
is
one
of
the
most
fantastic
smelling
beers
ive
ever
cracked
assuming
you
can
abide
the
lack
of
citrus
pine
cones
flavor
is
similarly
tropical
i
think
this
might
be
the
fruit
punch
of
ipas
and
as
promised
theres
a
good
dose
of
belgian
yeasty
goodness
throwing
a
wellplaced
curve
ball
into
the
brew
orange
peel
and
bitter
orange
soda
mixed
in
there
too
i
imagine
this
to
be
a
really
fresh
brew
the
flavors
are
strong
and
definitely
unconventional
and
i
could
easily
see
the
flavor
being
divisive
among
connoisseurs
i
commend
clown
shoes
for
the
novel
concept
fabulously
executed
but
still
ill
admit
the
flavor
isnt
exactly
all
beer
and
i
find
it
a
bit
tiresome
after
a
while
which
is
probably
for
the
best
given
the
wellmasked
10
5
abvs
mo
just
a
little
thin
and
abrasive
at
times
then
sugary
sweet
at
others
strange
i
dont
think
id
have
another
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
mine
was
bottled
22012
so
i
seized
the
reins
and
went
with
a
nearly
inverted
pour
i
think
that
my
judgement
may
have
been
rendered
compromised
at
that
point
in
the
day
my
overly
aggressive
pour
may
have
stirred
up
some
sleeping
beasts
i
got
a
dense
finger
of
tawny
head
from
my
ridiculous
pour
but
at
least
it
had
good
retention

i

i

mouthfeel
was
medium

it
brought
the
heat
whew
there
was
no
doubting
its
10
abv
but
that
might
have
been
low
actually
once
the
initial
fire
subsided
i
began
to
taste
a
sugary
fruitiness
which
they
called
candied
fruits
and
intense
and
i
was
not
going
to
disagree
finish
left
an
alcohol
burn
that
reminded
me
just
how
the
length
of
my

is
laid
out
i
felt
like
a

swallower
with
the
circus
dry
gaspingly
so
pour
me
another
justin
i
am
feeling
rather
poorly
at
the
moment
for
a
belgian
ipa
this
is
good
for
an
all
around
enjoyable
brew
its
soso
the
faults
inherent
in
the
style
exacerbated
by
the
extra
sugary
notes
introduced
by
the
brewer
whatevs
it
goes
down
better
than
i
would
have
thought
is
hoppy
and
boozy
and
those
spicyass
tacos
love
ya
mom
thanks
for
having
put
the
life
in
larger
than
life
cooking
in
my
kitchen
will
make
an
excellent
pairing
for
the
rest
of
this
methinks
overall
not
necessarily
the
most
memorable
beer
but
very
good
overall
could
do
with
a
touch
more
bitterness
but
maybe
i
say
that
because
i
have
never
been
the
biggest
fan
of
candy
flavor
in
beer
deep
clear
golden

craggy

to
call
this
an

far

heavy
in

exists
it
lends
to
a
semidry
finish
with
a
long
lingering
sweetness
as
a
big
boozy
belgian
blonde
this
beer
has
lots
of
complexity
with
well
blended
flavors
and
even
has
a
bit
of
complimentary
hop
to
call
is
a
belgian
ipa
or
a
hoppy
belgian
is
a
little
off
though
good
beer
just
misleading
not
what
i
would
say
to
be
typical
of
the
other
bipas
ive
tried
this
kicks
up
the
spiciness
and
a
lot
of
strong
citrus
hoppiness
to
it
the
finish
in
particular
was
not
all
that
dry
and
mostly
spicey
certainly
a
flavourful
beer
the
high
strength
makes
it
a
bit
of
a
different
profile
and
its
not
all
that
sessionable
really
but
the
spiciness
and
yeast
character
are
quite
pronounced
my
first
from
clown
shoes
wasnt
a
knockout
but
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
some
others
by
them
overall
i
love
a
good
belgium
beer
but
at
10
abv
the
alcohol
takes
too
much
of
the
taste
the
fruitiness
is
lost
behind
the
bite
the
light
to
medium
body
has
a
nice
even
softness
and
fluffy
smoothness
all
the
way
through
without
giving
up
its
crispness
at
any
point
it
sort
of
skirts
either
style
pours
into
a
chalice
with
a
deep
slightly
hazed
body
big
off
white
head
flowing
thick
fine

in
this
belgian

ipa
from
the
folks
at

aroma
is
full
of
spicy

citric
notes
from
the

theres
even
hints

think
mangopapaya

with

luscious
bready

layers
flavor
profile
a
hint
of
acidic
notes
from
the

but
a
super
sugary
sweet
experience
you
better
have
your
sweet
tooth
craving
before
cracking
this
decadent

hiding
in

mix
of
all
the
flavors
going
on
is
a
bruising
10

by
volume
hard
to
believe
theres
absolutely
no
heat
in
the
chest
with
each
sip
maybe
a
bit
of
warmth
on
the
palate
but
its
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
big
chewy
and
on
the
edge
of
cloying
healthy
dose
of
natural
feeling
carbonation
saves
all
of
the
sweetness
from
becoming
too
much
along
with
the
hop
bill
of
big
alpha
acids
to
dry
the
palate
enough
to
achieve
enough
balance
overall
a
big
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
caught
by
chance
while
out
hunting
for
some
3fs
zombie
dust
in
a
remote
but
well
stocked
beer
store
in
south
central
ohio
top
of
the
muffin
to
you
the
exclamation
mark
is
definitely
needed
muffin
top
is
an
excellent
belgianstyle
ipa
that
has
bold
elements
of
both
belgian
yeast
and
american
hops
ironically
enough
clown
shoes
dont
joke
around
dont
let
the
names
and
labels
fool
you
many
of
their
beers
deserve
serious
consideration
as
being
top
examples
of
their
respective
styles
overall
i
know
they
were
going
for
a
more
americanized
version
of
the
classic
style
but
i
dont
think
it
worked
out
well
eh
i
really
wasnt
on
board
with
this
one
just
didnt
fit
my
flavor
preferences
i
guess
i
do
like
belgian
ales
and
well
made
tripels
but
something
about
this
one
just
wasnt
cutting
it
for
me
hope
you
like
your
belgian
ales
spicy
and
minty
because
thats
what
this
one
is
all
about
the
almosthot
alcohol
presence
wasnt
helping
either
not
awful
but
not
a
constant
rotator
either
very
delicious
didnt
have
the
hops
flavor
i
expected
but
i
tend
to
like
less
hoppy
beers
dont
know
how
they
made
a
belgian
trippel
ipa
but
i
like
it
tried
clown
shoes
at
a
beer
festival
recently
and
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
what
they
have
to
offer
havent
been
disappointed

any

notes
and
very
smooth

on
for

a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
decent
example
of
the
style
the
belgian
yeast
worked
nicely
with
the
hop
profile
they
seemed
to
complement
each
other
but
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
seemed
to
overpower
those
when
it
came
to
the
flavor
and
that
made
this
beer
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
wasnt
too
smooth
fairly
filling
and
the
10
was
apparent
but
the
flavors
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
wouldnt
want
another
one
and
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
split
since
it
may
become
a
choir
for
me
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
appearance
they
were
both
very
good
and
the
highlight
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
drinkability
they
were
just
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
theres
a
few
other
belgian
dipas
that
i
would
rather
have
and
i
dont
think
i
would
really
recommend
this
beer
all
in
all
i
thought
this
beer
was
decent
there
were
some
aspects
i
like
but
there
were
some
that
i
didnt
its
defiantly
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
needs
to
be
cleaned
up
a
little
tramp
stamp
is
still
my
favorite
beer
from
clown
shoes
but
theres
still
many
more
of
their
beers
left
for
me
to
try
has
a
flourishing
offwhite
head
that
sticks
to
it
like
a
champ
hazy
golden
orange
and
pretty
a
sharp
resinous
aroma
hits
the
nose
and
were
off
to
the
races
followed
by
notes
of
caramel
orange
peel
and
grapefruit
fine
and
dandy
so
far
the
bitterness
loses
a
length
at
the
tongue
and
the
sweet
and
tangy
notes
catch
up
evening
thing
out
to
the
end
not
as
inyourface
as
the
label
would
like
you
to
believe
surely
a
craft
brewer
wouldnt
hype
on
a
label
for
marketing
purposes
but
fortunately
this
one
kicks
it
out
on
all
fronts
and
ends
up
being
a
very
wellbalanced
and
tasty
brew
despite
itself
overallnot
bad
the
scorchy
bitterness
throws
me
off
a
bit
but
still
worthwhile
all
in
all
o
an
odd
hybrid
brew
flavors
are
more
belgian
strong
ale
that
ipa
o
very
good
but
id
trade
a
lower
abv
for
better
disguised
alcohol
nice
complexity
and
flavors
with
a
solid
hop
kick
o
a
very
solid
and
unique
beer
surprisinglu
the
belgian
tripel
and
ipa
mesh
well
imo
only
knock
is
that
it
is
sweet
and
it
stays
sweet
might
be
too
much
for
some
o
a
solid
big
belgian
ipa
i
have
no
reason
why
a
bomber
of
this
costs
13
bucks
a
5
50
pint
at
happy
hour
is
much
more
reasonable
poured

aroma
was
a
mixture
of
citrus
and
barnyard
pretty
good
though
the
taste
is
moderately
bitter
with
a
mild
sweetness
and
a
mild
bitter
finish
the
texture
was
soft
with
moderate
carbonation
easy
drinking
for
the
high

and
tasty
well
balanced

has
a
noticeable
alcohol

nice

with
the

just

at

it

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount

with

this
beer
has
a
lower

of

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
solid

and
flavors
overall
this
is
a
pity
the
smell
is
so
good
but
not
the
taste
need
fewer
ibus
to
allow
the
other
flavors
to
be
sensed
overall
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
my

is
from

maybe
this

o
if
you
dont

a

this
may
be
too
strong
for
you
a
good
spring

fall
beer
overall
this
is
my
first
taste
of
a
triple
style
hybrid
no
pun
intended
it
is
really
interesting
and
quite
balanced
but
the
niceties
of
the
styles
are
lost
amongst
all
the
complexity
the
alcohol
10
abv
is
notable
nowhere
in
the
drink
which
is
a
victory
for
what
is
already
a
very
refreshing
beverage
it
is
unfortunate
that
i
am
drinking
it
in
the
middle
of
winter
as
it
would
really
fit
better
as
a
summer
beer
clown
shoes
did
great
with
the
idea
though
there
is
definitely
room
for
improvement
pick
this
one
up
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelves
it
is
more
than
worth
the
chance

orange

not

whereas
the
floral
and
belgian
yeast
aromas
dominate
taste
is
just
as
it
smells
the
belgian
profile
definitely
overpowers
the
hoppiness
this

is
supposed
to
have
not

a
bad
thing
flowers

pretty
spicy

alcohol
is

drinkability
is
fairly
high
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
great
option
for
belgian
beer
lovers
who
are
merging
into
the
hoppier
stuff
smells
and
tastes
like
candied
orange
peel
with
a
side
order
of
peach
preserves
and
medium
amounts
of
yeasty
phenols
and
booze
actually
the
nose
is
a
bit
hotter
with
booze
than
it
seems
to
present
to
the
tongue
and
the
nose
has
more
coriander
than
the
flavor
does
its
really
sweet
in
an
odd
way
however
more
akin
to
a
tripel
than
the
bottles
claims
of
belgian
ipaness
in
fact
overall
it
presents
as
a
mediocre
tripel
because
of
the
overly
citric
hopping
and
as
a
poor
ipa
for
the
same
reason
this
beer
is
good
evidence
for
why
threeway
mixing
of
styles
tends
to
be
risky
business
the
most
common
result
is
mediocrity
hazy
golden
body
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
lace
is
minimal
aroma
brings
bright
citrus
and
bready
belgian
yeastiness
some
alcohol
on
the
nose
as
well
flavor
is
pretty
good
but
the
heat
is
noticeable
in
this
one
also
get
the
breadycakiness
and
birght
hop
tones
this
is
definitely
a
belgian
ipa
kicked
up
a
notch
i
actually
prefer
a
straight
belgian
ipa
like
their
tramp
stamp
for
instance
to
a
higher
alcohol
version
like
this
good
beer
but
definitely
a
sipper
in
the
mouth
the
citrusy
hops
become
steel
bright
with
a
scaffolding
of
zucchini
bread
malt
hence
the
name
muffin
top
overall
full
bodied
the
high
abv
adds
nice
depth
nicely
balanced
citrus
malt
and
sour
o
i
liked
it
i
liked
it
alot
as
if
someone
took
a
pretty
good
tripel
and
tossed
some
hops
in
its
got
complexity
but
remains
really
scary
in
drinkability
for
the
abv
good
job
clown
shoes
it
has
a
nice
light
copper
body
with
a
minual
amout
of
head
that
lays
down
quickly
the
smell
had
a
nice
citrus
and
belgium
yeast
aroma
to
it
the
taste
was
kinda
citrus
and
sweet
up
front
then
the
hop
bit
came
in
around
the
middle
to
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
was
great
nice
an
smooth

overall
this
is
another
great

rather
hazy
with

nose
is
a
bit
of
stale
rye
bread
with
a
faint
spice
to
it
the
hops
are
green
and
earthy
but
very
light
the
taste
is
bigger
and
the
hops
come
through
more
there
is
sticky
malt
and
notes
of
caramel
underneath
hops
are
citrusy
and
herbal
with
faint
bitterness
there
is
a
bit
of
grain
underneath
with
a
slightly
syrupy
body
moderate
carbonation
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
o
the
tripel
style
is
really
the
main
focus
of
this
beer
with
a
nice
addition
of
hops
that
barely
justifies
the
ipa
part
of
the
label
simply
because
of
the
large
influence
of
the
malts
and
belgian
yeast
unlike
most
american
belgianstyle
ipas
this
one
actually
focuses
much
more
on
the
belgian
aspect
definitely
respectable
if
youre
really
looking
for
an
american
belgianstyle
ipa
from
this
brewery
go
with

this
one
leans
more
on
the
belgian
side
very
nicely
done
a
pretty
good
marriage
of
belgian

with
good
retention
and

aroma
of
caramel

spicing
smells
good
flavor
is
very
malt
forward
caramel
malt
strong
bittering
hops
and
mild
belgian
spices
flavor
is
understated
but
well
integrated
finish
is
malt
with
very
strong
bittering
hops
that
seem
to
concentrate
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
where
there
is
no
real
herbal
hop
flavor
but
a
lingering
hop
bite
interesting
subtle
flavor
to
start
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
on
the
astringent
side
medium
bodied
with
pleasant
creaminess
good
mouth
feel
a
well
made
imperial
ipa
that
tastes
good
but
could
use
some
more
herbal
hop
flavors
and
a
bit
more
flavor
in
the
finish
to
balance
the
hop
bitterness
d
a
good
beer
in
the
middle
between
a
belgian
ipa
and
a
tripel
id
have
preferred
it
more
if
clown
shoes
had
committed
to
either
one
or
the
other
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
revisit
o
a
good
belgian
ipa
the
flavors
are
very
strong
and
upfront
it
has
some
good
depth
to
it
o
very
impressive
beer
everything
balances
well
with
the
flavors
flowing
into
each
other
and
mellowing
out
as
the
brew
warms
really
impressed
clown
shoes
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
new
breweries
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
styled
beer
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
the
belgian
ipa
more
like
a
belgian
tripel
merged
with
an
ipa
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
and
found
the
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
think
the
flavor
is
quite
refreshing
and
one
i
would
be
happy
to
have
again
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
head
is
white
and
creamy
looks
like
a
nice
beer
overall
smell
is
of
a
very
sweet
fruit
maybe
a
sugary
orange
i
expect
a
certain
level
of
sweetness
in
a
belgian
but
this
is
somewhat
surprising
not
off
putting
overall
but
surprising
no
hops
on
the
nose
taste
is
slightly
sweet
not
nearly
the
sweetness
you
get
in
the
nose
and
there
are
definitely
hops
present
very
interesting
indeed
ooo
and
there
is
the
10
alcohol
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
leaving
a
boozy
mouthfeel
in
the
second
sip
getting
a
little
more
of
the
orange
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
and
you
can
definitely
taste
that
beer
has
some
alcohol
in
it
again
not
offputting
just
very
obvious
but
i
dont
mind
tasting
my
alcohol
a
little
bit
overall
a
good
beer
would
drink
again
on
tap
to
give
that
a
try
od
a
very
interesting
beer
of
little
style
designation
i
thought
perhaps
this
would
be
a
tripel
but
it
clearly
pulls
through
the
hops
however
there
isnt
enough
yeast
notes
to
make
me
think
belgian
ipa
the
result
however
is
pretty
tasty
reminds
me
of
some
japaneese
beers
surprisingly
the
beer
pours
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
quite
floral
and
candylike
with
some
pine
and
orange
citrus
notes
as
well
as
some
biscuit
malt
notes
the
flavor
is
very
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
floral
and
orange
notes
from
the
hops
along
with
some
pine
belgian
yeast
and
biscuit
malt
low
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
great
tasting
beer
plenty
of
belgium
and
american
pride
mixed
in
a
bottle
full
mouth
citrus
earthy
flavor
consistence
drink
from
the
front
to
the

abv

very
good

i
was
hesitant
to
try
the
new
clown
shoes
brewery
but
im
glad
i
did
vampire
slayers
next
cheers
o
a
solidly
made
drinkable
brew
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
certainly
not
as
good
as
the
regular
version
and
is
proof
that
imperial
doesnt
always
make
a
better
overall
the
dueling
tastes
in
this
beer
were
a
bit
distracting
the
herbal
notes
and
the
hops
were
a
bit
extreme
and
that
resulted
in
a
slightly
confusing
taste
not
my
favorite
but
still
pretty
good
o
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
its
a
big
beer
but
the
flavors
are
solid
and
its
really
drinkable
i
dont
know
if
id
want
more
than
one
bomber
in
a
sitting
but
id
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
that
ive
had
it
has
balance
its
smooth
and
drinkable
its
not
overly
flavorful
but
it
doesnt
disappoint
either
i
will
probably
have
this
again
the
flavor
was
biting
and
the
bitterness
came
in
thoroughly
which
isnt
a
surprise
i
was
right
about
the
begian
helping
with
the
overhopping
the
balance
wasnt
correct
though
just
dont
let
this
beer
warm
too
much
it
really
falls
off
if
it
hits
room
temperature
fresh
bomber
poured
in
a
duvel
tulip
somewhat
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
2
finger
white
head
eventually
it
recedes
leaving
a
foamy
center
that
actually
resembles
a
muffin
top
aromas
are
yeast
bread
orange
zest
pumpkin
spice
flavor
is
bread
belgian
yeast
orange
grapefruit
fall
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
there
is
noticeable
alcohol
as
expected
pretty
decent
this
is
my
first
clown
shoes
offering
o
overall
i
love
the
label
the
beer
is
pretty
solid
as
well
definitely
worth
a
try
very
stick
to
your
tongue
hoppiness
true
to
the
triple
ipa
and
the
belgian
in
it
brings
on
a
yeasty
bready
sweetness
nice
copper
color
and
clingy
lacing
if
you
pause
a
while
there
is
a
spiciness
that
lingers
in
the
nose
very
good
for
a
hophead
like
myself
i
am
sure
my
wife
would
hate
it
poured
a
clearish
dark
gold
hue
with
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
left
lace
on
top
of
a
strong
aroma
of
yeast
and
cnadi
sugar
touches
of
caramel
malt
and
bitter
citric
hops
strong
citric
tea
and
grassy
as
well
i
guess
hop
presence
along
w
yeast
give
it
that
typical
belgian
smoothorange
citric
zest
minus
the
peppery
clove
spices
mediumbodied
filling
goes
down
easy
balances
with
sweet
malts
although
other
than
a
sugary
caramel
swirl
i
cant
really
pick
it
out
finishes
balanced
and
crisp
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
the
abv
is
kept
at
bay
not
the
most
complex
or
greatest
belgian
ipa
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
overall
a
really
nice
belgian
ipa
a
style
im
usually
not
too
fond
of
poured
into
a
large
wine
glass
it
pours
a
light
yellow
ochre
color
developing
a
one
inch
head
that
dissipates
quickly
very
little
lacing
is
left
first
sip
the
hops
bittes
my
palate
i
can
taste
traces
of
citrus
tamarind
hops
are
dominant
in
the
aftertaste
i
like
this
packing
a
10
abv
i
think
i
am
going
to
have
another
cup
and
keep
drinking
beer
and
support
your
local
brewery
hog
o
a
decent
beer
overall
id
like
a
bit
more
hop
presence
and
more
carbonation
o
overall
a
good
beer
starts
off
mediocre
at
best
but
finishes
very
strong
worth
a
try
and
i
would
have
again
but
im
not
going
to
run
out
and
buy
the
supply
hv
served
in
a
snifter
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
cap
of
foamy
white
head
didnt
get
much
in
the
aroma
but
it
was
still
nice
with
scents
of
bready
yeast
and
citrusy
hops
taste
was
good
notes
of
bready
yeast
detected
in
the
nose
citrus
zest
and
fresh
fruit
honey
and
malty
sweetness
crisp
sharp
dry
finish
higher
alcohol
was
no
more
noticeable
than
most
other
ipas
ive
had
medium
body
and
fairly
enjoyable
thanks
for
the
chance
berto
d
i
enjoyed
this
to
an
extent
but
not
terribly
blown
away
its
good
but
i
wont
be
going
for
a
2nd
glass
is
it
an
amped
up
version
of
tramp
stamp
who
knows
where
the
beer
is
tasty
for
the
most
part
the
unresolved
sweetness
of
malt
and
the
abused
hop
profile
keeps
it
falling
short
for
either
belgian
golden
ales
or
ipas
o
good
beer
a
bit
thick
and
could
be
better
if
scaled
back
a
bit
in
abv
and
maltiness
o
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
are
getting
introduced
to
the
brewery
this
is
an
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
ipa
which
seems
a
little
off
the
mark
overall
a
great
beer
the
hops
are
balanced
by
the
malt
and
both
are
very
present
and
forward
overall
4
5
damn
i
did
not
see
this
coming
this
is
really
an
excellent
beer
if
you
ask
me
and
id
be
delighted
to
ever
see
it
in
a
bar
full
disclosure
i
picked
up
this
bottle
for
about
1
50
on
discount
from
my
favorite
local
store
because
they
had
bunches
of
it
and
it
just
wasnt
moving
i
am
so
so
glad
i
picked
this
up
its
a
surprisingly
solid
tripel
brewed
with
sweet
orange
peel
and
a
shitload
of
hops
a
double
india
pale
tripel
might
sound
like
a
potential
disaster
but
evidently
this
was
executed
very
well
clown
shoes
please
release
this
at
least
once
a
year
and
preferably
in
12oz

a
word
of
advice
dont
bother
with
it

but
i
really
enjoyed
it
another
clown
shoes
brew
to
prep
for
an
upcoming
tasting
it
pours
a
partly
cloudy

of

the
nose
comprises
honeydew
pine
resin
light
balsa
grapefruit
orange
zest
coriander
clove
banana
peel
and
sweet
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
the
citrus
fruits
are
now
favoring
their
rinds
and
peels
bringing
out
a
decidedly
more
bitter
situation
its
not
too
bitter
but
i
think
the
new
lack
of
fruitiness
is
a
general
detriment
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
a
generally
solid
bipa
but
one
that
falls
just
shy
of
making
me
really
happy
with
it
d
this
was
a
very
nice
ipa
but
not
very
belgian
it
had
an
enjoyable
scent
and
taste
with
very
good
body
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
maybe
not
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
but
a
very
enjoyable
drink
anyway
i
say
give
it
a
shot
nope
almost
but
not
quite
not
the
best
imperial
ipa
but
thats
not
what
it
is
ive
only
had
a
few
belgianstyle
ipas
but
this
is
certainly
one
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
is
the
4th
clown
shoes
beer
ive
tried
and
they
continue
to
impress
me
i
sure
hope
some
vampire
slayer
finds
its
way
to
ga
aroma
is
strong
fruity
and
yeasty
with
a
hoppy
note
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
it
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
with
a
fairly
thick
and
fluffy
ivory
head
that
leaves
substantial
lacing
fruity
flavor
is
mainly
apple
with
a
note
of
pear
and
malty
and
yeasty
tones
plus
a
subtle
hoppy
undertone
smooth
firmbodied
texture
is
edgy
and
lively
leaving
a
fizzy
fruity
and
malty
finish
this
style
can
be
pretty
hit
or
miss
in
my
experience
fortunately
this
one
is
well
balanced
in
taste
and
texture
and
its
flavors
really
shine
especially
for
the
alcohol
content
its
a
pretty
thick
and
smooth
beer
very

an
interesting
beer
that
i
might
try
and
get
fresher
to
see
if
the
hopsipa
comes
through
d
a
little
too
sweet
and
a
tad
over
spiced
with
orange
peel
goldamber
with
some
haze
and
a

decent

the

was
opened
fruit
candy

pineapple

hint
of

in

was

full
bodied
lowish

not
bad
at
all
but
a

on
the
sweet
side
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
though
the
alcohol
is
so
high
that
i
am
really
drinking
water
to
compensate
it
dries
you
out
a
bit
either
way
this
is
good
beer
and
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
american
dipa
variations
you
should
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
that
said
i
wouldnt
put
it
above
great
divide
hercules
or
dogfish
90min
but
still
it
is
a
good
brew
o
the
beer
has
a
very
interesting
taste
and
has
a
much
fuller
bodied
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
this
is
such
a
unique
taste
there
is
a
high
alcohol
taste
and
some
wheat
theres
a
bite
of
watermelon
im
tasting
blueberry
in
there
the
hops
provide
for
a
bitter
after
taste
cotton
candy
taste
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
tasting
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
i
cant
drink
too
many
but
its
uniqueness
make
it
a
must
try
this
is
the
first
cs
brew
ive
had
and
it
makes
me
want
to
try
others
it
is
really
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
mostly
because
of
the
dipa
used
this
is
one
of
the
hardertofind
cs
brews
but
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
for
hopheads
and
pretty
much
any
beer
enthusiast
initially
it
poured
very
clear
but
i
shook
it
up
some
to
see
if
there
was
any
sediment
in
the
bottle
and
on
my
second
pour
it
was
quite
hazy
just
as
other
reviews
claim
and
it
improved
the
taste
as
well
o
basically
a
pretty
extreme
beer
that
didnt
quite
hit
the
mark
the
alcohol
is
pretty
wellmasked
but
the
hoppiness
is
a
bit
too
much
ill
stick
with
the
tramp
stamp
as
ridiculous
as
that
may
sound
dclown
shoes
is
very
sweet
to
this
guy
you
will
never
think
this
is
a
10
abv
beer
amazing
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
dry
bitter
hops
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
and
spicy
notes
into
a
dry
boozy
finish
the
hop
profile
isnt
as
complex
as
the
aroma
suggests
with
only
faint
fruit
sweetness
instead
its
mostly
dominated
by
a
dry
earthy
presence
with
resinous
oils
and
grassy
pine
as
it
warms
im
picking
up
more
citrus
notably
orange
zest
but
its
still
subtle
the
slickness
from
the
hops
are
complimented
by
candy
sugar
other
than
that
there
arent
many
belgian
qualities
finishes
with
lots
of
sweet
boozy
heat
the
abv
is
not
well
masked
leaving
lots
of
warmth
in
the
chest
overall
im
not
super
impressed
too
much
going
on
and
not
enough
focus
on
what
it
wants
to
be
o
very
enjoyable
ill
admit
that
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
belgianstyle
ipas
but
clown
shoes
tramp
stamp
had
made
me
a
believer
in
the
style
long
ago
muffin
top
carries
on
the
tradition
by
taking
the
style
to
new
heights
and
i
found
everything
about
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
muffin
top
is
a
delicious
complex
brew
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
big
but
not
too
heavy
it
has
a
complex
feel
and
flavor
that
keeps
you
alert
is
a
pretty
drinkable
feel
and
is
a
wonderful
smoothness
cheers
flavorful
and
tasty
take
on
a
well
liked
style
smooth
honey
notes
abound
smoke
lime
more
tropical
fruit
and
yeasty
phenolics
well
done
likely
the
best
ive
had
from
clown
shoes
notes
another
one
aiming
to
define
the
range
of
a
belgian
dipa
nice
quality
and
provocative
im
just
not
so
sure
this
range
is
going
to
be
much
of
a
favorite
of
mine
overall
a
nice
belgian
ipa
that
hits
the
spot
easy
to
quaff
despite
high
abv
sip
this
one
slowly
and
enjoy
the
flavors
this
one
is
a
one
hit
wonder
that
fails
to
knock
anything
out
of
the
park
it
doesnt
have
much
identity
overall
the
first
real
let
down
from
clown
shoes
for
me
eep
golden
straw
color
coming
forward
right
away
nice
two
fingers
of
white
foam
quickly
come
up
and
over
the
top
of
the
glass
settling
down
with
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
that
quickly
takes
over
the
glass
very
cloudy
even
through
the
final
pours
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
aroma
of
honey
lots
of
grains
bready
malts
and
a
noticeable
amount
of
honey
whether
intentional
or
not
it
is
there
grape
skins
start
to
come
forward
now
as
does
a
light
touch
of
grass
nothing
really
bowling
me
over
though
first
sip
is
very
smooth
rich
and
well
carbonated
the
flavor
is
allowed
to
explore
the
palate
quite
nicely
and
really
makes
for
a
very
full
feel
light
grains
pears
peaches
apples
all
seem
to
be
well
represented
but
something
seems
to
be
missing
with
the
depth
here
just
not
as
full
as
i
would
have
liked
the
cpj
750ml
bottl
poured
into
chalice
on
102911
i
think
it
was
bottled
on
92311
so
less
than
a
month
in
the
bottle
pours
a
healthy
orange
haze
with
a
decent
white
head
smell
citrus
orange
to
be
specific
hops
and
yeast
so
here
is
where
things
get
weird
it
says
triple
belgian
ipa
and
it
is
its
basically
a
crazy
hopped
brew
with
belgian
yeast
i
taste
hops
yeast
and
orange
its
good
but
heavy
not
amazed
by
it
but
it
is
a
pretty
interesting
take
worth
a
try
especially
since
its
new
to
ny
nice
label
too
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
very
good
beer
picked
up
a
local
flavor
the
other
day
to
sample
orange
in
color
head
retention
was
good
smell
a
bit
complex
syrupy
sweet
not
bad
not
a
huge
bipa
fan
but
not
a
bad
offering
overall
not
bad
prefer
the
other
clown
shoes
selection
prefer
oomegang
bpa
as
an
alternative
one
and
done
very
interesting
brew
lots
of
orange
peel
and
coriander
smell
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
as
expected
from
a
belgian
tripel
but
immediately
you
begin
to
get
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
ipa
really
a
fantastic
beer
the
alcohol
isnt
too
prevalent
i
dont
review
a
lot
of
beers
but
felt
i
had
to
with
this
one
its
that
good
overall
not
bad
but
kind
of
a
mess
mix
of
spices
malts
lemon
and
citrus
hops
booze
galore
esters
etc
it
doesnt
really
know
what
out
wants
to
be
although
despite
all
that
its
still
fairly
tasty
just
not
very
drinkable
i
know
most
americans
and
hop
heads
will
love
this
beer
though
but
im
not
really
sure
what
to
think
of
it
since
its
just
all
over
the
place
and
not
sure
when
ive
ever
had
a
belgian
ipa
that
is
10
although
this
is
more
tripel
than
ipa
i
think
a
definate
try
o
not
really
something
i
cared
a
lot
for
overly
sweet
harsh
and
alcoholic
kind
of
hard
to
drink
and
the
flavor
profile
is
just
a
little
strange
pass
o
one
of
the
top
10
belgian
ipas
that
ive
ever
had
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
overall
i
think
clown
shoes
produced
a
winner
here
do
drinkability
is
moderate
clown
shoes
isnt
kidding
around
when
they
say
they
added
a
tripel
influence
to
this
beer
but
i
feel
it
greatly
overshadows
the
ipa
portion
which
i
feel
is
quite
weak
when
compared
to
the
excellence
of
the
hop
flavor
in
tramp
stamp
combine
that
with
the
high
alcohol
heat
and
you
have
a
beer
that
is
nice
to
sip
but
id
take
tramp
stamp
any
day
of
the
week
d
well
this
beer
delivers
exactly
what
it
promises
a
blend
of
american
hops
and
belgian
tripel
flavors
that
being
said
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
harsh
the
beer
is
too
sweet
and
i
dont
find
this
particular
marriage
of
flavors
all
that
appealing
that
being
said
i
can
see
others
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
overall
a
fantastic
brew
big
bold
complex
very
intense
definitely
a
sipper
worth
seeking
out
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
this
beer
really
surprised
me
in
how
much
i
liked
it
it
really
did
have
some
great
hoppiness
to
it
lots
of
juicy
fruity
hoppy
goodness
came
out
in
it
and
the
little
yeast
spice
was
just
enough
to
give
it
some
character
without
overpowering
it
a
great
beer
overall
and
definitely
my
favorite
beer
of
theirs
so
far
poured
into
my
duvel
vijf
20
oz
plus
pours
a
thick
hazy
brown
orangewith
a
bold
3
inch
sticky
cream
colored
head
smell
is
clove
banana
grapefruit
orange
and
little
bread
very
bold
all
those
flavores
more
aggressive
than
smell
the
body
is
large
with
a
ton
of
life
for
this
style
what
i
like
about
this
belgian
is
it
has
almost
equal
amounts
of
ipa
as
a
belgian
a
ton
of
flavor
and
a
wonderful
big
beer
medium
body
nice
carbonation
lingering
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
slightly
creamy
a
really
nice
version
of
the
style
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
and
plenty
of
citrus
flavor
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beverage
candy
and
hops
melded
into
one
and
pretty
big
bitterness
too
odclown
shoes
is
awesome
this
one
is
an
asskicker
this
one
will
be
sipped
again
by
me
eagle
claw
fist
is
probably
still
my
favorite
by
clown
shoes
but
perhaps
another
bottle
of
muffin
top
could
my
rankings
of
clown
shoes
beer
o
goes
down
easy
quite
tasty
somewhat
filling
well
hidden
but
big
kick
interesting
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
interesting
blend
of
belgian
and
ipa
enjoyable
but
at
10
a
bomber
will
more
than
do
ya
o
this
is
a
fairly
nice
belgian
ipa
not
my
favorite
from
clown
shoes
and
im
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
its
a
nice
mixing
of
the
two
styles
and
is
nicely
strong
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
respect
the
offering
though
overall
i
love
this
beer
im
drinking
it
as
i
type
wish
it
wasnt
almost
gone
o
wow
just
wow
i
dont
exactly
dislike
muffin
top
but
im
not
sure
this
is
a
beer
id
reach
for
again
it
was
an
interesting
beer
though
for
sure
and
masked
its
10
alcohol
with
ease
definitely
a
beer
that
packs
a
punch
one
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
very
interested
to
see
what
happens
to
this
over
time
another
terrapin
hit
for
me
they
can
do
no
wrong
o
a
really
great
hybrid
everyone
at
the
tasting
was
inpressed
recommended
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
considering
how
big
it
is
i
normally
dont
like
really
big
beers
defined
by
me
as
above
8
but
this
one
is
a
notable
exception
o
really
good
beer
that
hides
the
high
abv
very
well
easy
beer
to
drink
only
knock
is
would
like
more
hop
bitterness
would
like
to
try
a
fresher

i
was
surprised
at
how
good
this
was
typical
belgian
tripel
taste
all
the
way
with
good
hop
bite
almost
ideal
for
its
type
masterfully
made
and
i
would
expect
it
would
be
sure
to
please
any
lover
of
such
the
high
abv
is
well
covered
so
good
it
makes
the
name
seem
ironic
deceptively
smooth
a
really
nice
blend
for
my
taste
i
dont
love
some
belgians
usually
too
sweet
but
this
cuts
the
difference
with
hops
and
who
can
argue
with
that
a
very
americanized
beer
in
a
good
way
pretty
good
o
no
idea
how
to
properly
rate
this
one
on
one
hand
theres
little
to
no
hop
presence
on
the
other
hand
its
much
closer
to
the
belgian
trippel
than
many
of
the
other
american
renditions
of
the
style
so
it
loses
points
with
me
for
the
former
but
this
is
actually
pretty
decent
with
the
latter
medium
body
o
the
bottle
says
that
it
is
a
combination
of
a
tripel
and
an
ipa
i
think
the
tripel
won
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
very
different
from
others
in
this
style

medium

overall
a
good
beer
but
i
think
im
going
to
need
to
try
another
i
enjoy
terrapin
beers
especially
the
rye
and
the
big
hoppy
monster
so
will
give
this
one
another
shot
when
the
weather
cools
down
a
bit
to
see
if
i
feel
any
differently
about
it
this
ones
not
in
the
league
with
the
others
i
gambled
with
this
fourpack
and
i
lost
a
small
stack
i
dont
want
to
dwell
on
it
but
this
beer
did
not
meet
my
expectations
just
another
obvious
miss

it
starts
out
very

like
and
then
advances
to
being

bittered
a
little
more
bitter
at
the
end
then
is
quite
complementing
of
the

triple
flavors

o
really
solid
all
together
the
abv
is
felt
but
not
overpowering
good
drinking
brew
here
well
worth
a
try
and
i
will
again
this
is
a
lighter
colored
belgian
ale
very
hoppy
and
full
of
alcohol
the
hops
tame
the
alcohol
and
make
this
beer
and
extremely
easy
drinking
brew
for
being
a
9
6abv
i
was
over
welmed
at
how
easy
this
beer
was
to
drink
considering
how
the
hops
practically
jump
out
of
the
bottle
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
the
night
that
it
was
announced
osama
bin
laden
had
been
killed
this
will
always
be
a
special
beer
for
me
i
would
order
this
brew
or
pick
up
a
4pack
anytime
this
beer
is
a
must
for
the
hop
heads
and
for
anyone
who
loves
a
great
brew
overall
i
cant
stand
the
taste
of
this
beer
everything
but
the
taste
is
good
but
i
suppose
thats
why
you
buy
beer
nice
light
body
on
this
one
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
a
little
bit
low
i
wouldnt
mind
it
to
be
a
bit
more
lively
beh
a
little
dissapointed
with
this
one
seems
to
lack
ipa
qualities
such
as
a
hop
presence
in
the
flavor
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
it
didnt
deliver
what
i
hoped
it
would
poured
ontap
into
a
snifter
orangish
gold
in
color
with
a
white
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
floral
hops
citrus
taste
is
pretty
straight
forward
belgian
yeast
lending
a
peppery
note
some
earthy
hops
adds
flavors
of
pine
rind
and
a
residual
bitterness
white
pepper
and
a
dry
coriander
spice
medium
bodied
feel
nice
and
clean
overall
a
solid
belgianamerican
brew
o
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
have
a
couple
more
in
my
fridge
to
drink
on
some
warm
nights
i
am
not
going
to
drive
all
over
nc
looking
for
them
but
if
i
went
to
a
bar
and
saw
it
on
tap
i
would
order
another
one
poured
into
a
goblet
the
color
is
clear
ambercopper
not
a
lot
of
head
and
much
in
terms
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
winey
there
are
esthers
of
dried
fruits
the
flavor
follows
in
with
the
taste
the
alcohol
is
not
over
powering
but
it
certainly
is
noticeable
the
body
is
on
the
thinner
side
as
compared
to
our
american
style
the
hops
give
off
more
of
a
drying
effect
than
anythig
else
not
bad
for
the
style
and
probably
more
in
the
mold
of
what
i
want
a
belgian
ipa
to
taste
like
but
probably
a
style
i
need
to
experiment
more
with
overall
its
tasty
quite
tasty
in
fact
distinctly
belgian
in
flavor
but
i
hesitate
to
call
it
an
ipa
maybe
just
a
strong
belgian
pale
ale
this
beer
definitely
packs
a
punch
and
you
can
feel
it
after
just
a
few
drinks
i
like
what
they
were
going
for
with
the
hops
but
the
abv
makes
it
too
much
to
handle
glad
to
say
that
ive
tried
it
but
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
o
though
the
score
isnt
bad
for
this
beer
with
all
the
reviews
i
did
see
quite
a
few
recent
ones
of
people
really
hating
on
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
really
great
i
liked
the
balance
of
flavors
from
the
two
styles
but
they
could
have
been
a
little
more
pronounced
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
hope
some
northern
people
enjoy
this
at
dld
when
i
share
a
few
bottles
overall
a
pleasant
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
style
though
this
particular
bottle
might
be
suffering
from
some
age
which
seems
evident
by
a
faded
hop
character
o
overall
a
pretty
good
belgian
ipa
i
wish
the
hop
flavors
were
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
it
at
least
avoids
the
metallic
flavors
in
many
american
versions
of
the
style
oif
i
had
not
known
this
was
a
belgian
ipa
i
would
have
assumed
it
was
some
other
style
of
belgian
beer
i
dont
detect
the
hops
enough
to
consider
it
an
ipa
i
have
drank
2
of
the
4pack
at
this
point
but
i
think
im
going
to
throw
the
other
two
into
the
cellar
and
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
beer
right
now
i
think
its
a
little
uneven
got
a
nice
1
finger
head
on
the
pour
but
the
coloring
of
the
body
is
fairly
weak
very
light
orange
almost
the
shade
of
a
pilsner
which
is
not
a
good
look
for
an
ipa
smell
is
very
juicy
sweet
pineapple
with
the
expected
belgian
yeast
twang
of
clove
and
banana
also
slightly
peppery
nice
sharp
bitterness
upfront
muddled
with
a
twist
of
pineapple
but
any
other
flavor
is
kind
of
muted
has
a
peppery
aftertaste
carbonation
works
nicely
and
not
overdone
despite
rating
taste
average
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
all
around
hopefully
it
will
open
up
more
when
it
warms
i
prefer
raging
bitch
o
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
alcohol
content
and
its
presence
in
both
taste
and
smell
im
setting
one
aside
to
cellar
for
a
year
or
so
to
see
if
itll
mellow
out
a
bit
if
youre
looking
for
a
belgian
style
ipa
monks
revenge
would
be
a
good
one
to
seek
out
o
good
interesting
style
from
a
great
brewer
nothing
bad
from
here
d
pretty
good
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
i
could
put
down
2
and
feel
damn
good
about
it
i
1st
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
back
in
09
when
it
was
released
as
a
side
project
it
quickly
became
a
favorite
of
mine
and
i
go
to
the
store
the
1st
day
it
is
released
each
year
to
pick
up
a
4
pack
of
this
awesome
brew
a
rite
of
spring
monks
revenge
o
ive
been
disappointed
with
the
last
few
terrapin
beers
that
ive
tasted
however
when
theyre
on
theyre
really
on
tasty
stuff
d
another
graceful
dive
into
the
ipa
realm
for
terrapin
with
this
one
i
really
enjoy
the
uniqueness
of
the
belgian
variant
not
my
first
belgian
ipa
but
i
have
them
infrequently
enough
to
make
me
forget
about
them
from
time
to
time
i
really
enjoyed
monks
revenge
big
thanks
to
gford217
for
sending
this
guy
my
way
this
is
perhaps
by
favorite
belgian
ipa
its
not
super
hopforward
but
i
feel
like
it
puts
together
a
pretty
nice
blend
of
flavors
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
masked
a
bit
better
but
i
guess
its
acceptable
for
a
nearly
10
beer
while
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
its
also
absolutely
gorgeous
to
look
at
in
the
glass
d
medium
carbonation
some
sweetness
but
a
nice
balanced
beer
very
drinkable
o
meh
definitely
not
a
favorite
in
either
style
or
combined
styles
good
attempt
i
guess
i
wont
be
looking
to
try
another
anytime
soon
even
though
i
have
one
in
the
fridge
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
not
too
bubbly
thick
or
thin
overall
not
terrible
but
not
great
either
a
more
hoppy
presence
would
have
helped
me
along
here
i
believe
terrapin
achieved
exactly
what
they
were
aiming
for
sweet
malty
notes
of
a
tripple
with
a
nice
hop
balance
of
an
ipa
which
brings
me
to
my
dilemma
they
achieved
desired
results
but
i
dont
really
care
for
the
mix
oh
well
glad
i
tried
it
and
this
is
the
first
to
really
push
me
to
review
i
loved
it
drinkability
is
ok
definitely
an
interesting
beer
not
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
but
not
the
worst
probably
a
one
and
done
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
unless
it
was
really
fresh
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
alcohol
content
i
liked
the
2nd
glass
better
its
not
as
good
as
the
hercules
but
its
worthy
a
good
drinker
d
no
thanks
but
i
applaud
the
effort
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
if
the
two
styles
present
in
it
every
really
married
the
12
oz
bottle
produced
a
two
finger
worth
of
billowy
white
head
sitting
on
top
of
a
hazy
amber
orange
brew
i
got
some
belgian
yeast
coming
from
the
nose
with
a
nice
hop
aroma
sweet
citrus
and
pine
sums
it
up
the
nose
well
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
nose
being
sweet
and
bitter
it
is
really
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
ample
carbonation
for
the
style
the
only
drawback
was
a
slight
alcohol
heat
that
would
keep
this
from
being
something
i
would
drink
mass
quantities
of
other
than
that
i
enjoyed
the
brew
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
drink
this
improves
as
it
warms
and
while
not
especially
good
is
decent
maybe
this
is
older
who
can
tell
without
bottle
dating
but
for
a
dipatripel
there
is
some
missing
elements
here
drinkability
decently
drinkable
i
was
expecting
a
completely
different
beer
that
what
i
got
but
its
fairly
drinkable
for
what
it
turned
out
to
be
id
probably
drink
a
lot
more
of
this
beer
if
it
was
distributed
locally
and
thats
saying
enough
right
there
d
good
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
though
it
may
not
be
might
top
choice
well
rounded
though
i
would
like
there
to
be
a
little
more
emphasis
on
the
belgian
side
d
overall
this
is
the
best
bipa
ive
ever
tried
if
they
all
tasted
like
this
i
would
have
a
lot
more
love
for
the
style
overall
im
starting
to
feel
that
terrapin
just
isnt
my
bag
as
principal
skinner
once
said
prove
me
wrong
children
prove
me
wrong
like
others
have
said
this
came
a
bit
more
like
a
dipatripel
hybrid
than
a
traditional
belgian
ipa
while
it
lacked
some
complexity
this
still
stayed
fairly
interesting
and
drank
very
nicely
for
the
size
of
it
another
solid
terrapin
entry
pours
yelloworange
with
a
nice
white
head
nose
is
nice
with
a
lot
of
spice
and
a
bit
of
fruit
really
good
amount
of
floral
citrus
and
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
with
a
good
deal
of
spice
medium
feel
with
some
alcohol
a
nice
example
of
a
luckily
increasinglycommon
style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
descent
head
smells
of
flowery
hops
and
that
unmistakable
belgian
funk
taste
is
very
satisfying
tastes
like
a
mediocre
tripel
with
an
interesting
and
distinct
hops
finish
the
hops
firm
up
and
define
the
broadly
beglian
base
giving
it
a
crisp
finish
the
finish
is
helped
by
a
bubbly
carbonation
that
helps
to
make
this
otherwise
heavy
beer
lighter
and
more
drinkable
not
bad
at
all
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
la
chouffes
beglian
ipa
but
well
worth
a
purchase
there
is
nothing
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
that
would
lead
you
to
think
it
was
9
6abv
remarkably
drinkable
with
a
light
crisp
body
though
slightly
undercarbonated
this
one
didnt
do
too
much
for
me
i
just
found
the
taste
to
bee
too
messy
and
piney
sad
as
the
nose
really
showed
promise
this
is
an
excellent
blend
of
two
great
styles
notes
one
of
my
first
terrapins
and
one
of
the
few
imperial
belgium
ipa
ive
tried
as
a
brew
it
is
quality
as
a
take
on
bipas
i
dunno
the
tripel
side
is
more
accentuated
here
with
the
malty
range
instead
of
being
hop
prone
which
is
fine
but
may
not
be
that
close
to
my
preferences
others
tasting
next
to
me
and
with
quite
a
different
palate
are
liking
it
although
they
complain
about
the
forward
alcoholic
sense
very
nice
original
taste
definitely
closer
to
a
tripel
than
just
a
regular
belgian
ipa
d
an
interesting
combo
an
ipa
yet
a
tripel
at
the
same
time
it
tries
to
be
both
at
the
same
time
but
it
just
does
not
quite
mesh
together
completely
somehow
d
this
american
version
leaned
more
towards
the
belgian
side
but
it
did
have
a
nice
addition
of
hops
at
the
end
i
like
seeing
terrapin
taking
their
side
projects
and
making
them
seasonal
12oz
releases
d
this
is
the
kind
of
revenge
i
will
always
look
forward
to
poured
aggressively
into
the
tulip
only
yielding
about
a
finger
and
a
bit
of
bright
white
head
solid
layer
of
retention
on
here
no
lace
aroma
is
a
blast
of
bright
citrus
hops
more
on
the
tropical
spectrum
with
some
pine
involved
pineapplepeach
predominantly
and
potentially
some
green
apple
with
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
faintly
and
alcohol
as
it
warms
bitter
and
citrusy
upfront
different
fruit
comes
out
here
of
a
more
lemonorange
scope
but
fades
into
a
wash
of
alcohol
and
the
belgian
yeast
again
as
another
reviewer
wrote
it
comes
across
like
a
hybrid
dipa
and
tripel
which
i
think
comes
close
to
this
a
bit
fuller
in
the
mouthfeel
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
more
of
a
sipper
i
thought
this
one
was
but
quite
nice
when
warmed
up
some
more
d
kind
of
a
strange
brew
not
something
im
likely
to
pickup
again
but
interesting
none
the
less
d
not
particularly
great
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
to
open
up
if
youre
thirsty
pours
a
hazy
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
dry
yeasty
and
belgian
like
sugar
and
a
grapefruity
citrus
hop
in
the
taste
grapefruity
hops
and
a
thin
malt
backing
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
citrus
aftertaste
nice
big
hops
belgian
like
but
a
bit
thin
d
for
a
nearly
10
beer
im
supposed
to
say
low
but
i
could
have
these
until
i
blacked
out
a
real
possibility
with
this
beverage
im
afraid
i
hadnt
reviewed
a
belgian
ipa
in
a
while
this
really
reminded
me
why
i
like
the
style
so
much
the
nose
is
pretty
awesome
that
play
of
hops
belgian
yeast
really
does
it
for
me
a
bit
overwhelming
at
first
from
alcohol
fortunately
it
simmered
down
a
bit
tasty
brew
skål
this
beer
is
weird
but
i
dont
dislike
it
definitely
has
an
identity
crisis
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
more
i
got
to
try
this
recently
thanks
to
a
friend
and
it
was
interesting
not
quite
spicy
or
funky
but
definitely
belgian
it
was
orange
and
had
a
smell
of
hops
but
also
something
i
could
not
lay
my
finger
on
the
taste
was
the
same
way
it
was
neither
belgian
belgianstyle
ipa
or
dipa
it
was
weird
it
was
however
good
as
i
find
most
terrapin
beers
to
be
solid
i
dont
like
the
look
on
that
turtles
face
this
brew
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
loaded
with
pine
resin
and
grapefruit
hops
galore
a
dark
honey
hides
in
the
background
the
taste
follows
closely
heavier
on
the
honey
but
with
plenty
of
hoppy
pine
and
grapefruit
to
go
around
some
banana
clove
and
flowers
are
swirled
around
in
the
maelstrom
as
well
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
brew
an
interesting
mix
of
dipa
and
tripel
d
good
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
though
it
may
not
be
might
top
choice
well
rounded
though
i
would
like
there
to
be
a
little
more
emphasis
on
the
belgian
side
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
slight
tight
head
aroma
is
light
and
phenolic
with
a
little
fruity
apricot
flavor
is
phenolic
and
bitter
with
pear
apricot
bitter
apple
and
a
whiff
of
butterscotch
the
finish
is
cidery
and
bitter
with
a
little
sour
mouthfeel
is
prickly
d
smoother
than
some
of
the
other
americanbuilt
belgian
ipas
see
raging
bitch
and
calibelgique
and
i
think
it
works
a
little
better
to
have
a
bigger
malt
presence
nice
job
terrapin
what
an
odd
critter
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
amalgamation
of
styles
in
some
ways
it
reminds
me
of
captain
lawrence
xtra
gold
more
than
say
piraat
it
drinks
well
considering
the
abv
likely
my
favorite
terrapin
to
date
and
happy
to
see
no
evidence
of
the
earthy
hops
used
in
terrapin
gamma
ray
while
i
believe
i
might
prefer
either
a
traditional
belgian
or
a
tradition
american
style
dipa
monks
revenge
is
an
interesting
experiment
in
flavor
combinations
i
cant
say
i
found
it
overly
drinkable
however
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
and
it
makes
an
excellent
sipper
as
you
puzzle
out
the
flavors
which
are
either
hit
you
in
the
face
strong
or
quite
subtly
elusive
wow
very
surprised
to
see
this
is
9
6
also
surprised
to
see
it
is
an
ipa
while
the
hops
were
there
to
begin
with
they
faded
quickly
my
first
thoughts
were
ipa
when
i
smelled
it
out
of
the
bottle
but
changed
that
as
soon
as
i
started
smelling
and
tasting
the
beer
drinkability
its
a
good
tasting
beer
but
more
on
the
belgian
side
and
less
on
the
ipa
side
maybe
its
a
little
too
old
but
it
cant
be
more
than
7
months
not
sure
when
it
came
out
but
the
hops
seem
muted
overall
a
good
beer
i
like
belgians
i
like
ipas
cant
go
wrong
drinkability
i
dont
know
if
i
would
say
that
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
but
it
was
certainly
a
pleasant
experience
if
you
can
come
by
it
theres
really
no
reason
not
to
give
this
a
try
your
mileage
may
vary
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
heady
brew
that
clocks
in
at
just
below
10
abv
i
like
that
the
tripel
shines
a
bit
more
than
the
dipa
here
a
sweeter
and
spicier
version
very
likable
wont
make
me
forget
my
alltime
favorite
belgian
ipa
that
would
be
achouffes
houblon
chouffe
but
this
is
plenty
good
and
worthy
of
a
recommendation
thanks
again
jeff
d
wow
i
have
to
say
that
i
have
enjoyed
this
belgian
ipa
to
this
point
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
terrapin
d
id
need
a
few
more
to
really
say
its
got
a
lot
going
on
and
im
still
a
bit
up
in
the
air
on
this
one
notes
good
beer
in
general
but
dont
expect
the
hops
to
dazzle
you
d
a
tasty
ipa
and
the
belgian
yeast
is
a
bit
more
dominant
than
the
hops
but
flavors
are
well
developed
the
taste
has
a
low
alcohol
influence
in
the
taste
but
at
9
6
it
is
a
beer
that
is
good
for
sharing
drinkability
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
flavor
with
this
one
especially
with
the
high
abv
its
a
decent
tasting
brew
dont
get
me
wrong
but
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
id
say
its
worth
a
try
if
you
can
snag
it
but
dont
bust
a
nut
trying
to
score
a
bottle
md
very
easy
to
drink
nicely
carbonated
very
tasty
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
overall
a
decent
belgian
ipa
but
nothing
special
i
wouldnt
turn
down
but
not
one
to
seek
out
drinakability
plenty
of
the
belgian
traits
i
love
so
much
here
overall
very
drinkable
for
the
style
my
pour
didnt
last
too
long
glad
i
could
try
this
one
a
very
nice
blend
of
flavors
as
i
said
before
this
isnt
the
most
complex
or
interesting
belgian
ipa
out
there
but
its
a
nice
beer
with
some
good
american
hop
qualities
i
like
the
citrus
with
the
belgian
yeast
strain
which
imparts
some
good
qualities
without
dominating
the
beer
a
nice
beer
from
terrapin
which
rarely
disappoints
my
palate
notes
this
is
a
solid
beer
definitely
an
american
creation
in
the
field
of
belgian
ipas
ive
had
a
few
belgian
versions
and
there
are
much
more
subtle
this
however
shows
the
power
of
american
hops
terrapin
is
never
afraid
to
use
a
heavy
hand
when
it
comes
to
hops
and
this
is
no
exception
while
it
isnt
the
best
ive
had
it
certainly
holds
its
own
d
good
somewhat
as
advertised
a
hybrid
bipadipa
md
medium
body
with
a
semidry
and
tart
finish
volumes
of
carbonation
where
they
should
be
for
this
style
and
no
hint
of
the
high
alcohol
very
nice
sweet
aftertaste
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
and
the
transition
of
flavors
give
it
a
good
drinkability
this
is
good
good
stuff
one
of
my
favorite
beers
by
these
southern
bad
boys
hides
the
abv
very
well
i
get
a
faint
alcohol
burn
midway
through
the
glass
dangerous
since
there
is
no
real
indication
this
one
clocks
in
as
high
as
it
does
dthis
is
a
nicely
balanced
belgian
ipa
with
a
strong
hefe
presence
not
hugely
hoppy
but
definitely
makes
a
presence
and
hides
the
huge
abv
very
well
beer
is
strong
and
sweet
up
front
with
a
nicely
bitter
and
not
dry
finish
its
pretty
smooth
in
the
mouth
but
overall
theres
something
about
the
hops
that
arent
working
for
me
all
the
flavors
are
there
they
just
are
merged
into
a
single
thought
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
and
belgian
ipas
are
usually
a
mixed
bag
this
was
is
above
average
d
drinkable
but
not
what
id
call
the
best
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
cloudy
orange
in
color
aroma
is
banana
clove
yeastiness
and
perhaps
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
first
impression
on
the
flavor
is
that
despite
the
aroma
the
flavor
skews
ridiculously
bitter
and
boozy
very
hot
the
bitterness
overwhelms
the
rest
of
the
flavors
as
it
warmed
it
became
a
little
more
balanced
but
it
was
still
a
bit
of
a
palate
burner
i
think
it
needs
a
year
or
two
to
mellow
not
totally
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
all
in
all
this
is
ok
but
i
feel
like
the
various
elements
are
fighting
with
one
another
and
its
finishes
with
a
strange
unsettling
aftertaste
not
really
a
huge
fan
d
as
far
as
flavor
goes
this
is
a
tasty
beer
although
i
am
sure
after
2
or
3
you
will
lose
the
taste
of
it
or
anything
for
that
matter
due
to
its
high
abv
this
beer
is
best
drank
in
moderation
this
beer
is
now
being
offered
as
a
regular
series
instead
of
a
side
project
here
in
atl
what
can
i
say
i
havent
met
a
terrapin
that
i
havent
likes
and
this
beer
is
no
different
i
got
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
local
beer
festival
and
was
overjoyed
at
the
hoppiness
of
this
ipa
great
taste
great
feel
great
drinkability
what
more
can
i
say
ill
be
stocking
my
fridge
with
some
drinkability
is
moderate
it
is
a
tasty
beer
with
a
nice
feel
but
that
9
abv
isnt
hiding
anywhere
downright
drinkable
despite
its
hefty
alcohol
content
which
is
virtually
undetectable
wellbalanced
full
of
flavor
yet
infinitely
easydrinking
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
terrapins
greatest
offerings
no
wonder
they
brought
it
into
regular
rotation
this
is
too
good
to
remain
a
oneoff
this
is
a
pretty
strong
beer
and
i
would
stop
at
one
id
recommend
this
which
is
now
available
in
four
packs
d
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
i
really
enjoyed
sipping
this
beer
very
well
balanced
in
flavor
and
body
and
you
get
the
best
of
all
worlds
of
bold
citrus
hops
and
fruity
belgian
yeast
and
spicy
alcohol
o
i
think
that
this
is
a
good
belgian
beer
very
drinkable
and
i
love
the
creamy
texture
but
i
believe
it
to
be
lacking
in
the
ipa
part
to
consider
it
a
belgian
ipa
my
only
suggestion
would
be
to
add
to
the
hop
aroma
and
flavor
to
bump
it
up
if
these
areas
were
improved
i
would
bump
my
rating
up
to
the
4
range
a
really
good
beer
drinkability
the
abv
is
not
hidden
all
that
well
but
its
drinkable
enough
for
a
12oz
serving
this
is
a
pretty
good
effort
drinkability
is
good
although
the
high
alcohol
content
adds
some
limits
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
to
quell
hop
head
cravings
but
the
mix
of
flavors
really
works
well
and
makes
this
a
very
enjoyable
drink
drinks
more
like
a
belgian
tripel
than
an
ipa
no
major
american
ipa
flavors
are
detectable
overall
a
good
beer
though
and
the
rating
would
be
higher
if
this
wasnt
marketed
as
an
ipa
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
really
enjoyed
the
melding
of
the
flavors
they
did
a
very
nice
job
of
really
integrating
and
balancing
all
the
flavors
i
would
say
the
flavors
lean
more
towards
the
belgian
side
but
the
hoppy
flavors
came
through
nicely
in
the
taste
as
well
got
this
one
in
the
bottle
as
well
terrapin
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
brewerys
and
they
continue
to
amaze
here
i
am
a
recent
convert
to
ipa
style
brews
and
have
been
a
long
time
belgian
lover
so
one
can
imagine
me
initial
excitement
over
this
the
color
is
a
deep
rich
golden
brown
almost
like
a
good
quality
honey
the
smell
is
lacking
a
bit
but
that
may
be
because
it
is
only
hop
nothing
else
however
as
soon
as
you
taste
er
the
smell
will
seem
like
nothing
i
good
hop
flavor
like
a
common
ipa
but
the
after
taste
is
the
winner
this
one
gives
you
that
sweet
belgian
pop
there
at
the
end
there
is
a
little
heat
to
it
but
thats
just
how
you
know
its
good
d
id
say
this
one
is
one
hell
of
a
drinker
with
ipa
flavors
but
a
smooth
belgian
influence
have
a
few
you
will
too
be
under
the
influence
as
well
cheers
overall
this
isnt
a
palate
wrecker
by
any
means
but
rather
a
beautifully
integrated
beer
that
really
goes
beyond
both
genres

had
this
beer
very
shortly
after
it
came
out
and
astringent
the
body
of
the
beer
is

and
the
finish
is
full
the
beer
commences
a
brutal
assault
on
the

holy

this
is
cross

has
a

as
for
overall
drinkability
this
is
great
with
a
high
abv
and
a
belgianwhiteipa
flavor
this
is
perfect
for
sundown
and
beyond
during
the
autumn
after
a
long
hike
while
you
light
the
fire
pour
one
of
these
for
yourself
and
enjoy
overall
its
an
interesting
mix
of
us
hoppy
ipa
with
belgian
tripel
the
hops
are
balanced
with
the
sweet
malts
and
yeasts
a
little
less
complex
and
interesting
than
i
had
hoped
but
its
a
really
nice
warm
weather
refreshing
beer
but
with
a
wallop
the
more
i
drank
this
beer
the
more
i
liked
it
and
i
would
lend
my
voice
to
others
calling
for
terrapin
to
release
this
brew
on
a
regular
basis
pours
and
almost
clear
golden
red
with
some
pink
hues
around
the
edges
a
little
over
one
finger
of
dirty
white
head
slowly
wisps
away
and
leaves
a
few
broken
lines
of
lace
behind
subtle
floral
hops
are
accentuated
with
some
sweet
malts
and
bread
thus
the
belgian
style
i
suppose
an
estery
essence
works
itself
into
the
aromas
adding
complexity
and
putting
a
pleasant
finish
to
the
aromatic
experience
tastes
of
citrusy
hops
which
are
immediately
subdued
by
a
mixture
of
sweet
malts
and
phenols
a
good
alcohol
heat
hits
the
back
of
the
throat
and
a
another
bite
of
bitterness
is
also
felt
goes
down
fairly
smooth
although
the
lingering
alcohol
heat
might
detract
somewhat
but
doesnt
bother
initially
although
eventually
after
finishing
the
first
glass
makes
you
understand
whos
the
boss
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
in
nature
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
change
from
the
american
hop
bombs
were
all
so
used
to
the
beer
had
a
medium
to
full
body
perhaps
a
little
too
thick
for
my
taste
but
still
good
the
beer
had
a
nice
bitter
dry
aftertaste
and
was
well
carbonated
the
beer
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
give
the
abv
but
after
the
22oz
i
was
pretty
well
done
overall
a
good
beer
and
probably
the
first
one
of
the
side
projects
that
i
think
the
brewery
should
consider
brewing
on
a
regular
basis
not
really
my
favorite
from
these
guys
but
its
a
nice
beer
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
of
course
i
seem
to
have
developed
quite
a
taste
for
a
solid
mix
of
belgian
yeast
derived
flavors
and
aggressive
hops
i
could
definitely
see
this
as
being
a
touch
harsh
in
its
mix
of
phenolics
and
hops
for
some
people
but
i
cant
get
enough
thanks
to
psycohops
for
sharing
this
one
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
into
a
pair
of
standard
shaker
glasses
appears
a
hazed
muted
straw
yellow
color
with
a
very
thin
layer
of
quickly
fading
bone
white
foam
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
candi
sugar
grapefruit
bread
bubblegum
sweet
and
tart
a
bit
spicy
crisp
apples
a
notch
better
than
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
this
bob
m
d
its
got
a
surprisingly
full
body
big
almost
a
little
too
thick
honestly
but
good
a
nice
carbonation
keeps
it
from
being
sticky
or
overbearing
a
nice
easy
sipper
and
certainly
good
when
split
with
others
decent
enough
beer
like
the
friend
you
really
like
but
he
just
talks
too
damn
much
or
has
that
distracting
third
eye
on
his
cheek
eventually
it
kills
the
relationship
pours
a
hazy
golden
pale
amber
color
with
a
full
finger
wispy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
a
reasonable
amount
of
belgian
lacing
present
the
smell
is
good
but
on
the
subtle
side
earthy
belgian
yeast
lemon
and
harvest
fruit
aromas
like
a
nice
strong
pale
ale
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
creamy
and
tangy
with
hops
full
flavored
earthy
belgian
yeast
harvest
fruits
and
hints
of
lemon
the
experience
cleans
up
quickly
on
the
dry
side
very
drinkable
yet
big
on
abv
integrated
nicely
well
done
had
tons
of
fun
with
this
one
nicely
drinkable
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
does
not
reach
greatness
but
a
good
effort
from
terrapin
they
always
do
a
nice
job
terrapin
makes
some
good
beer
ive
sampled
a
couple
of
these
side
projects
and
they
seemed
to
miss
slightly
in
each
case
dont
get
me
wrong
theyre
still
good
just
a
little
off
base
thanks
for
the
generosity
rusty
d
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
ipa
i
hope
to
find
more
terrapin
brews
in
the
near
future
doesnt
measure
up
to
the
better
belgian
ipas
but
an
interesting
effort
d
this
was
an
extremely
interesting
brew
to
wrap
your
head
around
it
definitely
isnt
an
everyday
beer
but
if
you
are
looking
to
enjoy
something
new
and
different
pick
up
a
bottle
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
ok
drinkability
this
one
just
didnt
impress
me
all
that
much
drinkability
is
ok
while
its
not
bad
its
not
something
i
would
run
out
and
repurchase
not
a
great
triple
or
a
great
ipa
but
hell
worth
a
try
thanks
got
to
merlin48
for
sharing
this
one

taste
its
a
great
mix
of
flavors
but
the
beer
is
missing
the
deep
subtle
complexities
of
a
great
belgian
i
will
give
it
credit
that
for
its
strength
this
beer
is
very
very
drinkable
poured
in
to
my
dfh
snifter
and
poured
a
clear
gold
amber
the
head
really
took
some
elbow
grease
to
work
it
up
at
all
the
head
forming
so
small
reduced
the
strength
of
the
aroma
allot
which
is
sad
as
the
aroma
was
lovely
the
smell
came
mainly
of
fruits
and
then
hops
in
the
background
was
a
very
nice
mix
the
taste
was
something
interesting
as
i
felt
it
changed
between
hefe
and
a
belgian
ipa
the
fruits
are
very
strong
like
a
hefe
but
the
bitterness
follows
threw
great
mix
and
every
now
and
then
it
mixes
the
order
up
mouth
feel
was
ok
but
felt
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
go
down
as
i
drank
this
particular
brew
drinkability
is
good
but
one
bomber
and
you
pretty
much
done
great
limited
brew
would
pick
up
if
i
saw
it
again
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
and
mildly
bubbly
great
for
a
dipa
now
the
flavor
on
this
is
quite
a
conundrum
right
away
i
could
taste
a
nice
bitter
hoppiness
but
really
that
was
on
the
first
sip
alone
after
that
this
becomes
a
belgian
pale
ale
thats
it
i
cant
pull
any
hops
from
this
at
all
this
is
really
a
double
wow
what
happened
to
the
hop
presence
nothing
this
is
interesting
but
not
at
all
what
i
expected
too
belgian
not
enough
dipa
aromas
of
floral
hops
yeasty
and
fruitiness
tastes
of
the
same
fruitiness
yeast
floral
hops
and
lightly
earthy
some
spiciness
in
there
as
well
on
the
sweeter
side
with
the
alcohol
content
pretyy
much
hidden
its
pretty
drinkable
and
overall
a
fairly
good
beer
a
little
more
carbonation
and
it
would
be
very
good
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
likely
also
make
the
flavors
pop
a
bit
more
d
this
beer
is
unlike
any
that
ive
had
before
at
first
i
didnt
like
it
too
much
but
the
flavor
grew
on
me
this
is
something
that
i
wish
i
could
pick
up
again
now
that
i
know
what
to
expect
one
bomber
was
enough
and
i
didnt
feel
like
sharing
it
thanks
again
for
the
opportunity
md
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
low
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
the
9
80
is
felt
but
its
such
a
balanced
beer
its
easy
to
drink
nothing
really
smacks
you
in
the
face
but
its
very
well
done
overall
big
thanks
go
out
to
jcb
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
one
as
an
extra
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
was
gone
in
a
flash
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
light
fruit
and
candy
aroma
a
bit
of
pineapple
and
floral
hops
a
bit
of
yeastiness
definite
sweetness
to
it
i
must
say
this
has
interesting
mix
of
flavors
its
more
on
the
tripel
side
than
the
ipa
side
of
things
some
hop
flavor
is
present
mostly
the
floral
variety
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
bitterness
theres
a
solid
cracker
like
pale
malt
backbone
and
a
nice
belgian
yeastiness
to
it
and
plenty
of
warm
booziness
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
without
enough
bubbly
effervescence
to
keep
things
interesting
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
if
theyre
going
to
call
it
an
ipa
i
need
some
more
hops
not
bad
though
thanks
again
jason
terrapin
has
just
been
off
the
mark
for
me
so
far
with
the
side
projects
with
that
said
i
will
keep
giving
them
a
shot
since
i
like
all
their
regular
and
seasonal
brews
d
i
liked
it
nice
mix
of
belgium
and
american
ipa
sweet
fruit
and
bitter
citrus
pretty
easy
to
drink
if
you
are
in
to
ipas
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
more
esters
and
fruit
flavors
you
may
need
to
let
this
one
sit
a
little
or
look
elsewhere
it
is
far
more
ipa
than
belgian
d
overall
this
is
another
great
side
project
beer
keep
on
churning
them
out
terrapin
i
cant
wait
for
the
next
sp
very
flavorful
profile
probably
the
biggesttasting
of
terrapins
side
projects
yet
slightly
outing
their
gamma
ray
wheatwine
starts
with
a
nice
spicy
belgian
yeast
note
that
quickly
gives
way
to
raw
leafy
hops
and
chewy
belgian
malts
finishes
with
a
lingering
booziness
and
hoppy
bitterness
body
is
relatively
thick
and
harsh
even
for
a
belgian
ipa
somewhat
limiting
the
drinkability
however
the
uppity
carbonation
level
and
complex
finish
make
for
an
interesting
drink
terrapins
side
projects
seldom
disappoint
and
monks
revenge
carries
that
torch
well
d
im
sorry
i
only
traded
for
two
of
these
and
might
need
more
soon
mouthfeel
is
ok
the
sweetpeppery
aspects
of
the
beer
leave
an
odd
feel
in
the
mouth
sort
of
like
drinking
orange
juice
after
brusing
your
teeth
but
nowhere
near
that
bad
or
unpleasant
just
odd
its
still
refreshing
and
worth
a
try
poured
this
bomber
into
a
duvel
tulip
clear
apple
juice
in
appearance
with
a
solid
three
fingers
of
white
frothy
head
very
nice
to
look
at
in
the
glass
great
clarity
aroma
of
grapefruit
peel
spearmint
banana
and
clove
hit
on
the
nose
then
a
good
dose
of
hop
flavor
ensues
dry
and
citric
bitter
mouthfeel
bitter
finish
with
lingering
chalky
bitterness
drinkability
a
sipper
partly
because
of
the
high
carbonation
and
partly
because
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
make
of
this
beer
i
think
the
flavors
of
the
hops
clash
a
little
too
much
with
the
belgian
flavors
that
make
up
most
of
the
beer
still
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
picked
up
this
bottle
in
greenville
sc
a
few
weeks
ago
the
beer
is
dark
yellow
orange
color
a
little
hazy
with
a
thin
head
this
has
more
of
a
spicy
tripel
aroma
than
ipa
ive
had
several
beers
of
this
tripelipa
blend
variety
and
havent
really
been
taken
by
any
of
them
this
is
turning
out
to
be
much
of
the
same
with
less
ipa
and
more
tripel
in
the
smell
and
taste
well
done
for
what
it
is
i
guess
but
not
something
id
search
for
again
pours
out
a
deep
copper
color
with
incredible
clarity
i
love
watching
the
bubbles
rise
up
through
this
one
and
the
head
is
sort
of
thin
about
a
cm
but
its
clingy
and
very
pretty
a
good
looking
beer
the
smell
is
pleasant
but
it
doesnt
make
the
style
evident
theres
a
faint
bready
maltiness
with
whiffs
of
powdery
pale
malts
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
theres
just
a
hint
barely
a
hint
of
earthy
spicy
hops
like
tobacco
doesnt
smell
much
like
a
tripel
or
an
ipa
the
taste
is
very
nice
i
love
the
malty
flavors
there
are
raisins
and
sticky
very
sticky
bready
flavors
then
the
hoppy
spicy
flavor
kicks
in
i
like
it
theres
even
a
hint
of
fruitiness
in
the
back
but
let
me
explain
it
a
bit
more
off
the
bat
theres
an
orange
flavor
like
a
fresh
sweet
valencia
orange
maybe
a
clementine
this
an
earthy
leafy
almost
like
compost
flavor
something
like
tobacco
finishes
with
a
very
spicy
like
coriander
clove
citrus
peel
even
a
bit
of
flower
resins
the
bubblegum
flavor
is
quite
nice
in
there
too
this
one
is
very
complex
and
im
quite
interested
this
doesnt
seem
much
like
a
combination
of
a
tripel
and
a
dipa
but
like
layers
of
both
mixed
in
together
i
really
love
the
flavors
in
this
it
is
very
full
and
enjoyable
just
like
sticky
and
bready
from
the
start
with
the
hop
resins
keeping
it
a
little
dry
and
clingy
but
the
bubblegum
flavor
slows
me
down
in
drinking
it
its
definitely
a
sipper
slow
drinking
but
not
too
sweet
or
too
dry
really
fascinating
and
recommended
definitely
worth
a
shot
i
cannot
detect
any
alcohol
at
all
but
i
can
feel
it
in
my
stomach
two
thumbs
up
to
terrapin
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
dont
know
why
i
like
it
so
much
but
its
not
harsh
at
all
full
of
flavour
and
not
overtaking
and
warms
the
tummy
up
mmm
mmm
mmm
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
a
little
thin
i
think
this
beer
has
some
real
potential
perhaps
six
months
from
now
it
will
have
come
together
a
bit
more
and
jelled
currently
this
beer
is
definitely
young
and
needs
to
grow
up
all
in
all
a
solid
stab
but
just
not
enough
there
to
make
me
keep
coming
back
pours
a
light
golden
color
theres
a
bit
of
haziness
to
it
smell
is
peppery
and
spicy
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
even
more
of
the
spice
very
well
balanced
with
the
hops
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
quite
surprised
on
how
well
this
drank
and
just
how
balanced
and
smooth
it
was
a
little
bit
of
citrus
in
the
finish
a
very
good
offering
from
terrapin
glad
i
had
the
chance

nice
interpretation
of
whats
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
seems
a
bit
yeastier
than
others
ive
tried
carbonated
well
great
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
im
loving
this
side
project
series
a
nice
relatively
clear
and
crisp
looking
golden
ale
a
bit
of
bubbly
head
but
fades
pale
malt
and
a
dry
musty
hop
profile
faint
fumes
of
alcohol
a
decent
crisp
flavor
to
this
one
a
nice
dry
finish
and
lively
on
the
palate
but
the
alcohol
seems
to
come
through
a
bit
to
much
and
is
kind
of
distracting
im
not
usually
too
sensitive
to
that
but
its
not
really
working
here
not
really
enough
hop
flavor
in
this
to
cover
it
up
almost
a
wannabe
duvel
or
something
but
more
like
a
weak
belgian
pale
than
an
ipa
decent
though
but
i
much
prefer
some
of
terrapins
other
brews
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
expected
and
probably
the
best
part
of
the
beer
overall
not
very
drinkable
ill
have
to
try
this
one
on
tap
if
i
see
it
but
for
now
im
basing
it
off
this
one
bottle
and
it
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
series
sampled
through
the
efforts

it

a
good

that

were

while
i

i
have
had

of
beers

to
go

a

flavors
are
also
more
like
a

in
my

than
a

its
is
pretty
darn
good
phenolic
spice
flavors
with
some
grilled

flavors
meld
into
a
bit
of
citric
hop
but
it
never
really
comes
thru
to
strong
if
your
a
fan
of
say
a
hopped
up
tripel
than
you
will
be
all
about
thisme
i
think
its
good
but
not
anything
to
seek
out
for
my
taste
d
good
while
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
put
down
more
than
a
glass
or
two
of
this
in
a
night
i
would
have
no
trouble
revisiting
it

overall
a
decent
brew
alcohol
is
a
little
pronounced
which
affects
drinkability
not
bad
in
my
opinion
notes
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
my
first
belgian
ipa
and
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
i
have
little
faith
that
terrapin
will
make
this
a
regular
beer
in
their
lineup
or
even
a
seasonal
but
if
they
did
id
definitely
buy
it
again
and
thats
the
highest
form
a
praise
a
beer
can
get
it
is
overall
more
mild
than
hopslam
or
other
imperial
ipas
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
that
fits
that
description
than
make
sure
to
try
monks
revenge
before
its
gone
a
very
good
offering
from
terrapin
and
glad
to
see
them
reach
successfully
beyond
the
norm
drinkability
why
its
a
veritable
hoot
reminiscent
of
stones
calibelgique
the
writing
of
this
review
paired
well
with
the
murray
head
song
one
night
in
bangkok
playing
on
the
tv
behind
me
ah
murry
head
we
hardly
knew
ye
this
is
another
decent
brew
in
the
side
project
series
from
terrapin
nothing
groundbreaking
but
a
very
drinkable
ipa
with
plenty
of
belgian
character
in
the
taste
d
pretty
nice
overall
but
a
bit
weak
on
the
hops
more
like
a
slightly
americanized
tripple
than
a
belgian
ipa
d
well
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
my
only
squabble
is
that
this
is
far
more
dipa
than
belgian
there
just
isnt
that
balance
i
was
looking
for
if
this
beer
is
cold
that
dipa
quality
really
comes
out
big
time
closer
to
room
temperature
you
get
more
belgian
qualities
i
must
be
fair
in
that
respect
but
this
is
a
very
hopcentric
brew
i
just
feel
like
they
took
the
ipa
side
a
bit
further
than
the
belgian
side
still
both
are
represented
still
i
am
love
of
all
things
terrapin
if
terrapin
were
a
band
i
would
be
a
groupie
like
a
hardcore
groupie
i
am
going
to
take
this
experience
as
if
they
put
on
a
show
where
i
wasnt
completely
satisfied
maybe
the
set
list
didnt
have
my
favorite
song
but
i
still
had
a
good
time
i
may
have
contemplated
whether
or
not
id
go
back
stage
on
this
night
but
i
still
went
and
made
the
best
of
it
when
i
saw
that
terrapins
side
project
release
5
was
a
belgian
dipa
i
had
to
pick
up
two
bottles
and
not
just
my
usual
one
the
second
i
popped
the
cap
the
hops
hit
me
from
an
arms
length
while
the
beer
was
still
in
the
bomber
and
i
was
not
attempting
to
smell
it
after
poring
into
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
looked
clear
orange
golden
and
bubbly
but
the
head
was
tiny
and
remained
that
way
the
smell
from
the
glass
was
dominated
by
floral
and
citrus
hops
and
was
true
to
the
dipa
side
of
this
hybrid
style
the
taste
was
mellow
and
hoppy
and
probably
closer
to
a
milder
belgian
pale
ale
like
duvel
than
some
of
the
other
highly
yeast
driven
beers
from
there
the
spices
showed
up
much
more
clearly
after
the
beer
warmed
and
the
beer
turned
less
hop
centric
decent
body
but
a
little
under
carbonated
for
either
style
in
my
opinion
not
as
bold
as
i
was
hoping
but
very
enjoyable
anyway
d
easy
drinker
here
sweet
and
smooth
nice
addition
to
the
sideproject
lineup
im
not
sure
the
hopped
up
belgians
are
always
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
prickly
pours
medium
golden
with
an
okay
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
swirl
smells
sweet
and
citrusy
to
start
with
a
nice
undertone
of
lemon
and
then
some
belgian
sweetness
and
more
earthy
hops
taste
is
somewhat
similar
anice
blend
of
citrusy
hops
that
pack
just
enough
punch
to
make
a
statement
but
restrained
enough
to
not
completely
overwhelm
the
sweet
malt
and
fruity
belgian
esters
smooth
citrusy
and
slightly
sweet
in
the
mouth
refreshing
very
nice
i
can
see
drinking
this
a
number
of
times
o
i
would
have
like
the
fruit
from
the
nose
to
come
through
in
the
flavor
light
straw
color
mild
hop
smell
mild
flavor
slightly
fruity
this
beer
is
just
ok
overall
a
nice
belgian
ipa
heavy
on
the
fruity
hops
with
belgian
funk
to
complement
o
ok
eh
kind
of
a
mediocre
belgian
ale
with
a
mildly
spiced
tone
to
it
kind
of
thick
in
a
clogged
kind
of
way
almost
chalky
thing
going
on
too
kind
of
just
there
not
really
a
belgian
ipa
so
much
or
at
least
not
one
i
am
impressed
by
like
i
said
eh
overall
a
very
tasty
and
user
friendly
ipa
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
its
not
one
of
my
standard
ones
but
still
pretty
good
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazed
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
ton
of
white
fluffy
foamy
head
this
one
had
head
coming
out
of
the
bottle
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
top
aromas
of
bread
honey
yeast
cake
esters
and
some
berry
highlights
smells
are
light
but
tasty
flavors
are
light
and
crisp
with
a
buttery
cracker
and
floral
blend
on
the
forward
tongue
with
some
more
honey
rich
notes
in
the
backbone
smooth
light
bodied
with
a
softness
throughout
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
belgian
yeast
strand
with
fruity
notes
and
funk
the
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
subtle
spice
linger
i
would
gladly
drink
this
beer
again
to
see
what
i
might
have
missed
on
this
first
taste
but
doubt
i
will
be
seeing
it
around
home
o
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
neither
belgian
yeasty
or
the
hoppy
aspects
take
center
stage
the
result
is
a
little
strange
but
still
relatively
tasty
and
drinkable
drinkability
is
ok
its
pretty
digestible
and
the
taste
isnt
overbearing
but
im
not
loving
it
and
wouldnt
rebuy
o
i
found
this
to
be
an
easytodrink
belgian
ipa
because
it
wasnt
too
bitter
or
dominated
by
yeasty
flavors
overall
this
is
a
brew
that
is
tasty
and
refreshing
one
i
would
definitely
do
again
initial
taste
is
creamcycle
orange
the
hop
taste
remains
there
but
it
is
an
aged
taste
light
orange
body
and
a
great
long
lasting
head
i
just
received
this
bottle
from
luekens
liquors
there
may
have
been
some
time
since
brewed
which
should
not
be
critical
for
a
belgian
ipa
good
drinkability
though
not
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
above
average
mouthfeel
too
much
carbonation
pours
a
golden
hue
with
a
creamy
three
finger
head
and
clingy
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is

belgian

and
spicesthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
above
moderate
carbonation
and
has
tastes

hopsbready
belgian

and
finished
with
a
piney

spicy
bitter
finish
and
overall
its
a
nice
mix
of
belgian
and
american
ipa
and
would
drink
again
cheers
othe
hops
and
yeast
strike
an
interesting
balance
here
and
this
is
a
unique
beer
within
my
realm
of
experience
the
hop
character
seems
to
become
more
perceptible
as
i
drink
the
glass
down
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
dont
have
any
comparables
when
it
comes
to
aggressively
hopped
belgian
style
beers
all
the
hallmarks
of
the
style
are
here
to
be
sure
belgianstyle
pale
ale
on
the
high
end
of
the
alcohol
range
and
perky
bitter
westcoast
yankee
hops
decent
but
without
flair
my
skirt
remaining
barely
ruffled
sometimes
the
whole
is
not
better
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
i
would
say
if
i
was
being
unduly
pissy
which
i
am
sorry
ive
had
some
good
luck
with
this
brewery
and
ill
keep
paying
10
to
try
a
bomber
but
i
slightly
overpaid
for
this
one
an
ok
beer
but
there
are
better
belgian
ipas
out
there
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
spices
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
earthy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
ipa
given
the
competition
for
ipas
today
i
would
be
hardpressed
to
say
i
would
order
another
but
it
was
good
to
try
and
if
the
mood
strikes
me
i
would
have
another
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
spotty
billowy
white
head
aroma
starts
with
a
lemony
tang
accompanies
with
soft
spices
such
as
clove
and
pepper
very
pungent
flavor
is
strong
with
clove
allspice
and
pepper
amazing
that
it
was
masked
so
much
in
the
aroma
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
come
through
in
taste
as
well
bitterness
is
grassy
and
barkish
and
strong
lingering
a
moderate
amount
the
huge
flavors
swing
back
and
forth
almost
balancing
each
other
out
feel
is
also
balanced
with
a
dry
finish
very
interesting
and
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
always
been
a
fan
of
the
belgian
ipa
substyle
coronados
version
is
a
nice
textbook
version
citrus
hops
honey
yeast
flowers
a
little
alcohol
bite
paired
nicely
with
a
catfish
poboy
covered
in
hot
sauce
a
nice
beer
lots
of
hops
yeast
clove
and
spice
complex
belgian
ipa
pretty
well
put
together
with
the
yeast
providing
tropical
varied
fruit
and
the
bitter
hop
kick
alcohol
well
hidden
but
it
could
be
smoother
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
overall
this
beer
has
some
excellent
qualities
with
some
minor
drawbacks
but
overall
i
must
say
that
i
did
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
a
pretty
good
belgian
ipa
but
a
little
bit
all
over
the
board
not
as
smooth
as
id
hoped
this
current
version
is
listed
as
7
5
abv
and
74
ibus
with
the
hops
being
warrior
centennial
and
chinook
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
olive
tree
in
ocean
beach
o
not
bad
for
an
ipa
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
to
just
drink
alone
probably
great
if
paired
with
the
right
cheese
taste
good
and
has
a
dry
hoppy
finish
but
not
overly
bitter
at
9
one
could
get
quite
tipsy
on
this
beer
because
it
drinks
quite
well
i
had
this
beer
at
the
slo
xtreme
beerfest
it
pours
a
very
cloudy
golden
color
with
an
antique
white
head
it
demonstrates
good
head
retention
citrus
and
pine
nose
clean
crisp
pine
presence
up
front
that
quickly
yields
to
raw
oat
flavor
interesting
but
not
my
favorite
im
in
love
with
this
beer
its
heady
which
is
to
say
that
its
a
little
hot
but
a
great
aggressive
hoppiness
and
interesting
spice
character
with
makes
for
a
delicious
spin
in
a
belgian
ipa
two
thumbs
way
up
overall
as
the
name
would
suggest
this
a
hop
assault
on
the
tongue
and
mouth
its
pretty
much
a
onenote
beer
for
me
would
have
liked
to
see
some
other
flavors
complimenting
the
hops
not
sure
where
the
belgian
part
comes
into
play
with
this
one
o
interesting
flavors
but
maybe
a
little
overboard
on
the
bitterness
final
thought
for
8
a
pop
and
9
this
is
nice
but
not
an
every
day
ipa
like
idiot
that
is
the
best
beer
they
make
by
far
still
very
nice
o
wow
his
beer
is
really
amazing
i
wouldnt
have
minded
a
tad
bit
more
body
as
well
as
a
little
bit
more
bitterness
but
the
bitterness
is
not
something
i
would
knock
it
for
damn
good
tasting
ipa
especially
for
the
price
o
a
veyr
solid
ipa
o
this
was
a
big
beer
and
im
glad
i
waited
around
for
a
12
oz
bottle
of
this
to
show
up
definitely
a
sipper
not
much
belgian
qualities
more
of
a
sweet
american
version
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
golden
copper
color
with
a
very
little
amount
of
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
very
minimal
next
to
nothing
really
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
a
super
hoppy
and
sweet
im
enjoying
the
aroma
of
this
quite
a
bit
actually
the
taste
of
the
beer
doesnt
scream
belgian
to
me
really
its
got
a
lot
of
american
style
hops
in
it
that
kind
of
kill
off
any
of
the
belgian
flavors
that
it
might
have
in
there
somewhere
still
i
find
it
to
taste
very
good
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
is
oily
and
lightly
carbonated
very
smooth
and
for
me
very
drinkable
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
id
probably
drink
it
again
no
questions
asked
not
that
big
on
belgian
ipas
but
this
comes
across
as
a
well
done
belgianus
hybrid
i
wouldnt
have
a
lot
of
these
but
one
is
certainly
worth
it
pours
a
deep
golden
in
color
solid
off
white
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
of
spicy
pungent
grapefruit
hops
in
the
flavor
mainly
grapefruit
hops
with
some
pith
zest
and
rind
action
with
a
substantial
bitterness
for
a
belgian
style
ipa
this
misses
the
mark
and
is
clearly
in
the
american
ipa
style
with
the
belgo
yeast
only
making
itself
known
in
its
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
crisp
carbonation
and
hop
bite
overall
a
nice
ipa
style
beer
but
not
enough
belgian
influence
to
be
true
to
style
despite
using
belgian
yeast
beyond
some
aspects
of
the
flavor
this
is
a
domestic
style
through
and
through
still
coronado
knows
what
to
do
with
hops
so
this
is
worth
seeking
out
o
i
could
tell
from
the
first
smell
that
this
bottle
was
probably
toast
theres
no
way
coronado
would
brew
a
belgian
style
ipa
with
this
kind
of
tang
because
theyre
a
talented
bunch
of
folks
which
tells
me
its
the
bottle
ill
definitely
give
this
one
another
go
around
and
adjust
my
review
as
such
i
really
like
the
beers
from
coronado
however
if
i
werent
expecting
more
belgian
flare
in
the
aroma
and
taste
and
this
were
classified
more
as
a
big
ipa
i
might
enjoy
it
more
the
pungent
acidity
reminds
me
more
of
what
i
experienced
with
a
mikkeller
i
beat
you
mad
mex
featuring
hoppy
daze
ipa
on
tap
right
now
intense
array
of
citrus
hops
brings
out
beligan
spices
as
well
the
moderate
carbonation
and
the
smooth
drinking
body
goes
hand
and
hand
one
of
those
beers
that
drain
themselves
than
you
find
at
that
mad
mex
is
charging
nine
bucks
a
glass
for
this
masterpiece
an
excellent
product
but
so
limited
that
mad
mex
is
selling
it
for
a
set
price
of
nine
dollars
a
pour
but
it
only
charges
4
50
during
happy
hora
mf
thats
why
they
can
get
away
with
the
inflated
pricing
even
the
brown
ale
from
coronado
was
nine
bucks
fuck
wilson
mcginnley
and
fuck
mad
mex
for
9
dollar
pints
this
beer
was
excellent
too
bad
i
couldnt
drink
another
serving
without
spending
18
dollars
did
i
mention
they
want
to
serve
this
in
12
ounce
pours
citrus
floral
and
earthy
hops
stand
tall
against
the
barrage
of
west
coast
hops
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
malts
are
plentiful
enough
to
create
some
balance
drinkability
overall
is
quality
but
the
price
leaves
this
one
on
the
experimental
backburner
a
bad
bottle
maybe
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
ruben
but
not
one
id
have
again
to
be
honest
d
again
the
alcohol
doesnt
show
up
and
it
has
a
kind
of
slick
mouthfeel
probably
the
highlight
of
the
beer
o
belgian
ipas
often
fall
a
bit
short
for
me
but
this
was
quite
good
very
nice
flavors
to
this
beer
d
this
is
a
well
made
drinkable
beer
md
mediumbodied
almost
milky
viscosity
with
a
mellow
carbonation
that
lends
to
the
body
nicely
extremely
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
in
large
quantities
o
interesting
beer
but
somewhat
unbalanced
tastes
more
like
a
muddied
ipa
than
a
true
belgian
ipa
with
the
yeast
character
very
much
subdued
d
i
enjoyed
this
to
an
extent
but
i
was
blown
away
last
year
its
good
now
but
i
wont
be
going
for
a
2nd
glass
where
as
last
tear
i
had
three
d
nice
belgian
ipa
for
sure
not
sure
how
fresh
it
is
so
i
wont
pass
to
much
judgment
on
the
hops
but
i
think
this
brew
super
fresh
might
be
awesome
or
if
this
is
super
fresh
its
a
good
beer
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
large
white
head
the
initial
aroma
is
very
hoppy
with
both
grassy
and
citrusy
orange
hops
the
flavor
is
belgian
yeast
and
grassy
as
well
as
some
fruit
flavors
with
citrus
as
well
as
a
little
banana
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
purchased
at
abes
in
bethlehem
for
around
6
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
bright
yellow
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
fluffy
off
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
are
of
orange
creamsicles
menthol
apricot
grapefruit
peach
mango
sweet
malt
pine
spicy
yeast
better
than
medium
bodied
and
dry
with
ample
carbonation
pretty
tasty
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
very
good
aroma
flavor
feel
and
finish
wish
i
had
more
of
these
just
an
all
around
terrific
beer
from
the
folks
at
coronado
impressive
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
i
did
dock
a
12
point
for
not
quite
fulfilling
my
hop
craving
but
that
is
quickly
overlooked
by
my
excitement
for
this
style
of
beer
i
love
belgian
ipas
the
belgian
character
is
subdued
by
the
high
hopping
rate
and
the
hops
seem
to
lean
in
the
pelletized
direction
a
mild
wet
paper
note
is
found
thoughout
as
well
probably
not
the
freshest
example
of
this
beer
drinkability
despite
the
abv
which
is
well
concealed
i
could
dink
a
few
more
of
this
one
i
kept
wanting
another
sip
and
found
this
a
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
beer
ill
definitely
be
looking
to
have
this
beer
again
this
is
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
talk
about
day
and
night
i
so
enjoyed
this
from
a
bottle
but
from
tap
the
sweetness
comes
pounding
through
too
much
so
the
hops
and
yeast
are
nice
but
the
sweetness
needs
to
be
dialed
down
a
bit
i
left
disappointed
shame
too
split
a
bottle
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
pa
poured
into
a
tulip
the
beer
was
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
sticky
white
head
the
aroma
was
a
big
nose
full
of
of
sweet
piney
resin
with
a
mild
earthy
note
im
really
impressed
by
how
clear
and
rich
the
smell
is
damn
the
flavor
diverges
surprisingly
with
a
much
grassier
citrus
rind
flavor
likely
the
belgian
element
kicking
in
like
most
really
good
beers
it
could
still
be
more
complex
but
this
is
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
thanks
to
plunkett
for
introducing
me
to
this
fine
beer
hv
this
is
just
a
down
right
enjoyable
brew
it
has
such
a
ripe
hoppiness
to
it
that
i
cant
really
even
find
fault
that
the
hops
drown
out
the
belgian
yeast
character
to
a
large
degree
letting
the
beer
warm
up
certainly
helps
the
phenols
in
the
finish
become
more
noticeable
and
a
herbal
slightly
vegetal
and
grassy
character
is
accentuated
as
well
but
ultimately
this
is
all
about
the
hops
as
it
should
be
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
of
this
strength
which
is
definitely
requisite
in
my
book
for
anything
with
ipa
on
the
label
this
definitely
hits
the
spot
for
this
ofttimes
hop
head
and
even
has
a
bit
of
yeast
character
to
keep
the
funky
freak
in
me
at
least
slightly
interested
id
like
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
to
compare
to
my
earlier
rating
from
the
brew
pub
sample
at
stone
this
brew
is
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
medium
and
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
citrus
hops
and
grass
mediumbodied
and
moderately
bitter
with
grassy
hops
citrus
and
light
malt
flavors
slight
spice
and
yeast
are
present
as
well
the
finish
is
hoppy
and
leaves
a
mild
spice
and
hops
aftertaste
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
decent
and
very
drinkable
belgian
ipa
though
i
really
think
it
would
be
better
fresh
as
the
hops
have
faded
a
bit
as
it
is
this
is
a
light
and
fruity
sweet
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
bottle
408
pours
clear
gold
with
a
huge
white
head
strong
yeasty
aroma
with
a
lot
of
banana
and
clove
it
nearly
drowns
out
the
floral
hops
taste
is
the
same
bubblegum
and
clove
abound
then
the
grassy
pine
hops
come
in
at
the
end
the
closest
thing
to
this
is
the
urthel
triple
hop
ipa
this
one
is
sweeter
but
i
dont
know
which
is
better
drinkability
a
fine
belgian
ipa
a
great
change
of
pace
for
an
ipa
beer
tasting
my
only
previous
experience
with
coronado
brewing
company
idiot
ipa
was
a
positive
experience
nevertheless
i
didnt
expect
hoppy
daze
to
blow
me
out
of
the
water
like
it
has
this
unique
delightful
elixir
deserves
a
lot
more
love
than
it
gets
bottom
line
the
flavor
of
american
hops
married
to
the
complexity
of
belgian
yeast
thumbs
way
up
d
fun
to
try
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
belgian
ipa
really
well
done
and
a
differenced
take
on
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
am
glad
i
got
a
few
of
these
as
i
believe
they
will
hold
up
very
well
over
time
and
really
make
a
fine
addition
to
my
regular
lineup
definitely
a
top
notch
beer
in
my
opinion
drinkability
is
average
the
sweet
malts
overwhelm
the
restricted
hop
profile
the
belgian
aspect
is
different
and
exciting
although
the
ipaness
is
sort
of
drowned
out
here
odd
actually
a
little
off
balance
hoppy
and
bitter
on
the
finish
with
a
biscuit
bready
middle
leaning
into
caramel
on
the
finish
hints
of
citrus
and
peach
with
even
more
in
the
way
of
pine
and
bits
of
earth
middle
seems
to
be
somewhat
lost
for
just
a
second
and
than
it
all
comes
back
full
throttle
on
the
finish
ahh
well
after
reading
the
bottle
i
see
that
this
brew
is
femented
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
that
would
explain
the
lack
of
a
middle
a
good
dipa
but
just
cant
get
past
the
middle
very
nice
approach
to
a
belgian
ipa
style
not
terribly
balanced
between
the
2
styles
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
i
could
barely
read
the
label
but
i
think
it
said
it
was
nine
percent
alcohol
thought
this
was
more
like
a
dipa
anyways
definitely
a
belgianstyle
india
pale
ale
regardless
also
tasted
this
on
tap
at
hamiltons
about
a
month
ago
might
drink
again
worth
trying
at
least
once
d
i
really
like
what
cbc
has
been
doing
recently
this
is
definetly
unique
and
fun
with
that
being
said
this
one
has
me
intrigued
and
confused
at
the
same
time
nonetheless
an
easy
beer
to
drink
overall
quite
tasty
and
quaffable
like
i
said
not
the
hops
bomb
west
coast
ipa
but
still
one
that
has
a
good
convergence
of
characters
worth
trying
out
on
tap
at
the
cbc
pours
a
red
slightly
hazy
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
the
head
leaves
a
huge
lacing
as
it
drains
aroma
is
completely
hops
with
lots
of
sticky
pine
smells
huge
amounts
of
bitterness
and
a
very
hoppy
finish
this
one
could
have
used
more
of
a
malt
base
to
back
up
the
hops
i
love
big
hoppy
beers
but
this
suffered
on
drinkability
without
the
malt
base
hazy
amber
colour
with
a
thin
lace
of
white
head
good
retention
for
the
meager
amount
of
foam
off
the
pour
light
malty
flavour
sits
underneath
a
combination
of
citrus
and
resinous
hops
highly
resinous
bitterness
with
a
citrusy
hop
flavour
light
sweetness
most
of
the
way
through
finishing
on
the
dry
resinous
side
medium
body
and
carbonation
dry
resinous
texture
overall
the
hops
really
overpower
the
malt
base
but
its
still
a
nice
beer
reminds
me
of
the
hopmaniac
ipa
at
ontap
in
la
jolla
certainly
not
as
bitter
or
powerful
or
inyourfave
as
stone
ales
i
swear
that
it
was
listed
as
a
double
ipa
on
the
board
above
the
bar
it
fits
the
regular
ipa
category
pretty
well
very
well
done
ipa
a
lighter
ambercolored
offering
than
the
four
brothers
pale
ale
this
brew
provided
much
more
of
a
hop
experience
the
body
as
noted
was
light
amber
and
clear
with
a
decent
white
head
and
good
lacing
very
malty
and
hoppy
nose
with
more
presence
than
the
pale
ale
decent
flavor
with
nicely
subdued
hop
presence
yet
clearly
a
wellhopped
offering
but
refined
and
restrained
good
feel
and
finish
easily
a
session
beer
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
beer
with
out
the
bitter
after
taste
a
simple
american
ipa
spiked
with
belgian
yeast
it
works
just
fine
can
poured
into
nonic
pint
glass
great
citrus
nose
and
golden
color
has
a
very
well
balanced
hop
profile
with
the
yeasty
belgian
feel
that
this
beer
promises
drinkable
almost
to
the
point
of
sessionable
despite
the
6
5
abv
very
solid
the
bros
review
pretty
much
matches
my
experience
except
i
didnt
detect
any
tobacco
or
green
bananas
this
ale
is
a
real
class
act
cheers
poured
from
a
pint

into
my
goblet

reddish
haze
poured
a
solid
finger

with
some
big
bubbles
aromas
of
belgian
funk
and
some
banana
and
then
some
nice
lemon
lemoncitrus
came
through
on

side
the
funk
was
very
smooth
and
there
was
a
nice
bitterness
to
boot
excellent
balance
and
flavor
light
mouthfeel
more
of
a
nice
clean
ipa
feel
than
a
belgian
or
at
least
those
i
have
tried
this
was
a
really
well
done
beer
and
the
best
belgian
ipa
that
i
have
tried
i
may
have
to
try
more
overall

this
is
interesting
to
me
because
it
kiiind
of
breaks
the
molds
of
other
belgian
ipas
most
are
some
combination
of
american
ipa
with
nominally
belgian
yeast
legit
but
overhopped
saison
or
hoppy
tripelbspa
this
is
more
like
an
amberish
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
moderate
but
wellplaced
load
of
mixed
american
and
classic
noble
hops
thats
how
it
comes
off
to
me
anyway
that
said
its
not
phenomenal
by
any
meansjust
solid
to
very
solid
in
almost
every
way
though
i
am
a
sucker
for
lacing
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
into
the
belgian
ipa
thing
o
overall
this
was
an
excellent
ipa
the
belgian
yeast
strain
and
the
hops
compliment
but
do
not
over
power
each
other
recommended
overall
a
very
unremarkable
beer
it
has
a
decent
appearance
although
the
rapidly
disappearing
head
and
the
poor
lacing
detract
from
it
the
flavor
does
not
support
the
aroma
which
at
least
supports
the
claim
to
be
something
of
a
belgium
nature
perhaps
it
is
significantly
better
on
tap
worth
trying
once
to
tick
fusion
beerhoppy
pale
ale
light
brown
and
cloudy
looking
beer
aroma
of
citrus
and
pine
along
with
sweet
smell
from
yeast
can
definitely
taste
the
hops
in
this
beer
leaves
a
bitter
taste
in
your
mouth
after
the
initial
sweet
taste
overall
delicious
beer
o
pretty
decent
belgian
style
ipa
for
me
its
a
little
sweet
but
being
a
hop
head
and
trying
to
rate
fairly
per
style
i
think
this
brewski
is
a
better
than
average
representation
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
will
do
in
a
pinch
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
it
had
a
smooth
modest
carbonation
poured
from
a
tallboy
can
into
a
pint
glass
huge
head
with
lots
of
lacing
tough
to
get
a
decent
pour
out
of
a
can
just
another
reason
to
love
bottles
color
is
a
coppery
amber
smells
a
fruity
cooper
aroma
tastes
as
it
smells
no
surprises
bland
grapefruit
and
mild
copper
taste
mouth
feel
is
thin
and
not
memorable
i
love
ipas
and
dipas
and
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
offerings
of
the
style
so
many
better
craft
beers
out
there
pass
on
this
one
and
pass
me
a
two
heart
overall
a
well
crafted
belgian
ipa
worth
seeking
out
nothing
short
of
amazing
very
well
rounded
with
no
compromise
when
it
comes
to
the
american
ipa
part
of
this
brew
the
belgian
side
pulls
its
own
weight
rustic
but
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
things
this
brewery
did
for
this
amazing
brew
is
packaging
it
in
a
tallboy
can
hell
yeah
overall
this
is
an
excellent
twist
on
the
american
style
ipa
really
like
the
dry
finish
and
hop
character
golden

perfectlybalanced

beautiful

certainly
moreish
refreshing
the
abv
is
not

some

at

pour
poured
cold
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
clear
calm
caramelcopper
color
with
a
fair
offwhite
head
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
very
solid
bubblegum
floral
hop
with
delicate
grain
some
cotton
candy
sweetness
very
nice
and
just
what
i
like
in
a
bipa
the
flavor
comes
on
with
a
slightly
more
subdued
bubblegum
with
more
of
a
yeasty
bite
and
bright
wheat
and
sweet
corn
the
body
is
medium
light
and
theres
a
fairly
lush
feel
from
the
frothy
carbonation
but
it
hints
at
a
bit
of
a
watery
quality
at
times
the
taste
really
is
a
minor
let
down
after
the
attractive
smell
that
introduced
it
but
its
certainly
a
good
brew
theres
some
apple
and
pineapple
ideas
here
and
i
guess
i
have
to
identify
some
clove
some
general
spiciness
and
pumpernickel
bread
it
seems
to
get
better
as
it
warms
up
nice
brew
but
there
are
others
i
like
better
for
this
style
overall
drinkability
a
wonderfully
quirky
ipa
overall
a
solid
offering
very
drinkable
good
with
pizza
im
not
embarassed
to
say
i
prefer
it
to
other
ipas
it
doesnt
taste
like
reefer
madness
or
diabetes
semisweet
earthy
yeast
flavors
play
nicely
alongside
a
mellow
hop
profile
dry
slightly
metallic
mouthfeel
but
highly
drinkable
im
really
developing
an
appreciation
for
vivant
well
done
overall
a
stellar
belgian
ipa
and
i
love
the
fact
that
it
comes
canned
they
find
a
grat
balance
between
the
belgian
yeasty
floral
characteristics
and
the
hoppy
bitterness
i
wish
it
was
easier
to
get
in
my
area
regardless
definitely
seek
this
one
out
and
try
it
for
yourself
for
the
love
of
god
do
it
and
yes
i
drank
this
beer
sober
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
put
this
up
as
one
of
the
best
ipas
that
i
have
ever
had
if
you
strictly
love
the
hops
then
this
wont
be
a
great
ipa
for
you
however
if
you
enjoy
belgian
style
beers
and
also
enjoy
american
ipas
this
is
a
good
mix
of
the
two
it
focuses
on
the
hop
aroma
and
bitterness
but
still
has
that
farmhouse
flavor
that
vivant
always
looks
for
i
appreciated
this
adventurous
ipa
aroma
taste
nice
hop
notes
of
herbs
and
pine
and
medium
body
slight
malt
notes
to
it
overall
the
beer
had
good
hops
that
added
a
nice
bitterness
to
the
beer
the
beer
didnt
take
to
long
to
finish
with
no
lingering
bitterness
the
triomphe
belgian
ipa
from
brewery
vivant
was
pleasantly
surprising
it
had
an
orange
or
amber
appearance
with
a
full
body
it
had
a
strong
smell
of
hops
the
flavor
and
mouth
feel
were
very
fullbodied
it
was
both
rich
and
heavy
but
a
great
beer
all
and
all
lovely
orange
color
the
smell
is
quite
sweet
and
fruity
without
any
spice
or
funk
flavor
is
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
with
a
lot
of
cherryorange
and
only
a
little
tartness
a
nice
beer
but
id
prefer
something
with
less
fruit
more
tart
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
o
overall
it
was
good
but
it
could
definitely
use
some
work
the
rotten
aftertastes
have
got
to
go
im
sure
vivant
could
work
on
this
very
well
o
i
had
one
when
i
bought
it
two
weeks
ago
and
hated
it
today
it
is
not
as
offensive
ill
chalk
it
up
to
being
drunk
the
first
try
pint
can
pours
copper
with
a
tall
rocky
ivory
head
that
holds
excellent
retention
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
awesome
nose
with
floral
hops
fruity
tropical
notes
citric
spicy
belgian
yeast
tastes
are
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
bitterness
and
complexity
fresh
grapefruity
citrus
shines
through
the
caramely
and
biscuity
malt
fruity
and
spicy
notes
come
through
with
the
belgian
yeast
finishes
bitter
with
some
pine
and
astringency
thinner
body
but
ample
carbonation
overall
it
did
pull
through
in
flavor
even
though
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
initial
wow
factor
with
appearance
and
aroma
definitely
recommendable
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
bought
it
for
my
can
collection
but
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
good
mouthfeel
nice
beer
overall
o
great
brew
from
vivant
i
dont
know
why
ive
always
hesitated
picking
this
up
but
i
am
definitely
going
to
pick
it
up
more
often
theres
a
boldly
hoppy
aroma
that
states
its
presence
sharp
crisp
and
strawlike
the
flavor
is
hop
forward
with
a
strong
straw
presence
that
finishes
with
some
orange
citrus
very
light
belgian
character
to
be
honest
this
strikes
me
more
as
a
straightforward
ipa
with
some
floral
notes
at
the
end
which
i
suppose
is
the
belgian
aspect
a
nicely
enjoyable
blending
of
styles
which
i
enjoyed
i
certainly
wont
have
any
trouble
working
my
way
through
the
remainder
of
the
four
pack
overall
i
find
it
to
be
a
very
tasty
and
approachable
beer
very
friendly
to
food
i
am
guessing
it
would
be
a
little
more
versatile
with
food
than
most
ipas
the
belgian
notes
meh
id
like
some
more
phenols
and
fruity
esters
to
give
a
more
characteristic
belgian
flair
the
idea
for
a
spelunky
drinking
game
came
to
mind
during
this
beer
every
time
you
die
you
take
a
drink
could
be
deadly
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
partlycloudy
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
slightlyglowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
pine
resin
grapefruit
rind
light
grass
and
very
light
belgian
yeast
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
good
amount
more
grapefruit
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
nice
belgian
ipa
though
nothing
amazing
itll
definitely
quench
your
bipa
thirst
c3
average
taste
again
shows
great
balance
and
has
a
firm
assertive
malt
presence
the
yeast
gives
it
more
of
a
phenolic
flavor
than
most
of
this
style
hops
are
grassy
and
dont
seem
to
fight
the
yeast
as
much
as
a
tropical
or
overly
citric
variety
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
despite
the
sweetness
maybe
some
more
co2
is
solution
would
be
better
this
is
a
good
beer
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
admittedly
not
a
favorite
style
for
me
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
beautiful
head
and
steady
lacing
the
smell
is
fairly
sweet
with
the
yeast
and
clove
prominent
and
it
tastes
kind
of
like
a
mulled
ipacitrusy
hops
but
also
cinnamon
clove
even
a
touch
of
nutmeg
im
digging
this
one
mouthfeel
is
also
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
pleasant
lingering
spice
will
definitely
buy
again
o
this
beer
has
a
great
blend
of
fruity
and
abbey
yeast
characters
that
blend
with
nice
hops
flavors
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
with
is
a
good
balance
with
the
fruity
flavors
it
just
loses
the
aroma
to
quickly
very
nice
belgian
ipa
pours
coppery
bronze
like
so
many
of
them
smells
a
little
sweet
like
a
distant
bakery
and
malt
and
grain
and
breads
and
only
sweetish
fruits
and
desserts
taste
is
malt
and
sweet
and
biscuits
and
some
bitterness
but
subdued
for
an
ipa
it
has
the
feel
of
a
belgian
thats
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
fussy
and
refreshing
and
zippy
and
dry
great
here
overall
a
fine
offering
a
quality
belgian
ipa
it
was
also
nice
to
have
with
some
brisket
m
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
the
style
it
was
going
in
the
right
direction
but
it
seemed
to
be
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
it
had
good
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
a
pint
or
two
but
that
would
be
my
limit
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
drinkability
this
beer
looked
really
good
and
was
much
more
drinkable
then
i
thought
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
flavors
seemed
just
a
little
muted
and
not
as
intense
as
they
should
be
it
might
be
a
little
old
but
with
no
canning
date
i
cant
be
sure
so
im
holding
that
against
them
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
and
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
you
are
into
this
style
all
in
all
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
brewery
vivant
it
seems
to
me
that
all
their
beers
are
pretty
solid
at
the
least
and
that
is
really
reflected
in
their
three
year
round
beers
i
would
say
this
is
my
second
favorite
with
solitude
being
my
favorite
and
farmhand
being
my
least
favorite
good
job
guys
you
make
some
quality
beers
and
you
can
beer
sure
that
i
will
be
waiting
for
the
next
new
brew
from
brewery
vivant
to
hit
the
shelfs
i
see
good
things
in
the
future
for
this
brewery
overall
i
have
been
to
vivant
and
know
they
are
better
than
this
try
a
different
style
of
theirs
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
with
good
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
built
around
good
belgian
characters
of
fruit
and
spice
reddish
brown
slightly
hazy
with
a
good
cap
of
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
and
good
retention
nose
is
quite
yeasty
light
spicing
some
tropical
fruit
notes
pineapple
sticks
out
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
citrus
zest
a
good
sweeter
malt
character
is
evident
taste
is
yeasty
grainy
breads
light
citrus
notes
and
the
pineapple
is
less
pronounced
drying
feel
but
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
body
or
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
a
pinch
of
spice
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
a
bit
bitter
not
a
bad
belgian
ipa
but
really
doesnt
put
everything
together
in
a
way
that
i
dig
o
this
beer
looked
great
but
the
rest
was
pretty
hohum
im
a
little
spoiled
with
live
a
rich
lifeshark
pants
at
my
disposal
but
i
digress
pretty
average
for
this
relatively
new
style
but
i
applaud
the
effort
a
little
more
balance
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
and
it
would
be
much
better
o
certainly
not
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
tastes
like
a
very
malty
floral
ipa
and
lacks
the
belgian
flavors
associated
with
the
style
i
suspect
that
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
but
i
cant
find
any
canning
date
not
terrible
but
i
didnt
really
enjoy
it
03292012
thanks
to
justin
for
sharing
a
bit
better
than
average
for
a
belgian
style
ipa
but
a
very
interesting
offering
for
a
pounder
can
id
like
to
try
more
of
there
stuff
but
unfortunately
they
arent
in
the
pittsburgh
area
overall
its
almost
3
beers
in
one
a
farmhouse
a
hefewiezen
and
a
weak
ipa
its
nice
beer
with
decent
complexity
but
i
wanted
more
hops
from
this
beer
to
withstand
the
strong
belgian
influence
in
this
beer
from
the
yeast
its
still
a
nice
summertime
brew
overall
a
great
twist
on
the
normal
ipa
would
love
to
see
more
breweries
take
a
stab
at
this
cool
brewery
too
worth
a
visit
too
much
boiled
vegetables
no
sir
i
dont
like
it
pleasant
ipa
an
american
ipa
moderated
by
the
belgian
yeast
flavour
citrus
hop
a
different
hop
would
have
added
some
differentiation
light
coloured
body
and
light
coloured
though
substantive
head
medium
mouthfeel
pretty
good
drinkability
this
beer
would
do
well
in
ontario
o
great
beer
for
a
style
that
for
me
at
least
misses
the
mark
more
often
than
not
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
brewery
vivants
beers
16
ounce
can
into
tulip
no
canning
date
pours
crystal
clear
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
3
finger
dense
khaki
head
with
incredible
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thick
cap
that
lingers
some
decent
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
with
decent
carbonation
streaming
up
aromas
of
grapefruit
orange
caramel
pine
herbal
bread
and
yeasty
spices
nice
and
well
balanced
aromas
but
on
the
weak
side
taste
of
big
grapefruit
caramel
pine
herbal
biscuit
orange
and
yeast
spices
good
amount
of
herbal
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
citrus
bread
and
yeast
spices
great
balance
of
hop
flavors
bitterness
and
belgian
character
with
a
hop
character
being
a
little
more
pronounced
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
drinks
fairly
easily
at
6
5
with
only
a
slight
alcohol
warming
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
belgian
ipa
has
the
belgian
character
without
going
over
the
top
and
still
retaining
good
hop
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
it
was
tasty
but
there
were
some
flavors
and
feels
that
just
did
not
mesh
well
together
some
good
points
to
the
beer
but
overall
it
fails
to
come
together
into
anything
more
than
an
aboveaverage
beer
an
easydrinking
and
tasty
belgian
ipa
from
brewery
vivant
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
the
flavors
are
distinctly
belgian
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
the
ipa
influence
is
lost
within
the
mix
this
isnt
very
hoppy
at
all
which
loses
it
some
points
for
the
style
o
milder
than
what
i
expected
and
thats
a
plus
an
easy
drinking
wellbalanced
belgian
ipa
o
a
decent
brew
but
i
think
theres
plenty
of
belgian
ipas
out
there
that
are
better
id
probably
revisit
this
though
to
get
a
better
feel
the
one
can
that
i
have
may
not
be
quite
enough
to
give
a
fair
judgment
freshness
possible
updates
in
the
future
tastes
fresh
and
lively
coming
from
the
can
just
does
not
taste
particularly
belgian
to
this
drinker
deep
golden
straw
color
coming
forward
right
away
nice
two
fingers
of
white
foam
quickly
come
up
and
over
the
top
of
the
glass
settling
down
with
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
that
quickly
takes
over
the
glass
very
cloudy
even
through
the
final
pours
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
aroma
of
honey
lots
of
grains
bready
malts
and
a
noticeable
amount
of
honey
whether
intentional
or
not
it
is
there
grape
skins
start
to
come
forward
now
as
does
a
light
touch
of
grass
nothing
really
bowling
me
over
though
first
sip
is
very
smooth
rich
and
well
carbonated
the
flavor
is
allowed
to
explore
the
palate
quite
nicely
and
really
makes
for
a
very
full
feel
light
grains
pears
peaches
apples
all
seem
to
be
well
represented
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
the
fruity
notes
along
with
the
hops
i
would
have
another
serving
type
draft
interesting
but
not
so
pleasing
some
malt
flavors
but
more
on
the
sourish
side
meaty
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
minerals
and
salt
definitely
worth
a
taste
on
tap
however
overall
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
beer
that
leaves
me
wanting
a
bit
more
more
flavors
and
a
bit
more
interest
would
take
it
to
the
next
level
brewery
vivant
has
proved
that
they
can
make
a
quality
beer
but
i
have
yet
to
try
one
that
really
tugs
at
my
heart
strings
o
a
nice
beer
i
like
the
combination
of
the
belgian
and
the
ipa
it
combines
the
fruity
aromas
and
flavors
of
a
typical
belgian
with
the
hoppy
flavors
of
an
ipa
brewery
vivant
4packs
are
tasty
and
perfect
drinkability
for
watching
football
i
have
been
impressed
by
their
belgian
styles
and
farmhouse
ales
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
it
again
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
pleasantly
surprised
do
try
it
lighter
bodied
plenty
of
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
pretty
solid
once
again
probably
greatly
depends
on
the
freshness
overall
its
an
ok
beer
does
most
things
good
but
nothing
great
d
very
drinkable
the
beer
feels
a
little
off
balanced
with
the
hop
flavor
really
not
standing
up
next
to
the
strength
of
the
yeast
and
malts
i
like
the
depth
of
the
yeast
flavor
and
just
a
bit
more
hops
could
make
this
a
winner
i
would
gladly
trade
two
schlitz
tallboys
for
a
pint
of
triomphe
brewery
vivant
did
a
pretty
decent
job
with
triomphe
but
it
could
easily
be
improved
with
a
little
more
of
everything
more
hops
more
belgian
yeast
and
more
body
would
do
it
its
not
bad
at
all
just
needs
to
be
dialed
in
a
little
it
wont
affect
the
score
but
i
do
like
the
can
belgian
beer
in
a
canwho
wouldve
thought
its
alright
definitely
worth
a
try
o
an
above
average
but
not
overly
exciting
beer
flavor
is
predominantly
malt
and
the
watery
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
distracting
even
the
belgian
aspects
of
this
beer
are
downplayed
drinkability
is
good
ah
the
auditory
portion
of
tonights
program
otherwise
known
as
the
crack
glug
the
opening
overture
to
any
symphony
that
may
or
may
not
proceed
but
you
will
never
get
it
from
a
bottle
i
am
simply
astounded
by
the
way
that
each
of
them
has
produced
a
thick
dense
layer
anywhere
between
a
finger
to
two
or
more
fingers
of
head
and
even
more
so
by
its
sustainability
beer
drinkers
get
more
head
but
underlain
by
a
light
mustiness
this
is
the
equivalent
of
one
of
my
neohippie
redheaded
girlfriends
distilled
into
a
glass
i
have
known
you
many
times
baby
but
a
tasty
example
of
the
style

did
an
amazing
job
with
this
belgian
inspired
double
ipa
for
a
double
ipa
it
was
very
well
balanced
and
not
over
hopped
the

tied
this
beer
together
really
awesome
just
right
amount
of
bitter
and
smooth
with
an
impressive
abv
this
pours
beautifully
and
smells
great
but
feels
and
tastes
like
a
hop
juice
box
without
any
bitterness
to
note
from
the
hops

a
bright
hazed
golden

with

a
fair
bit
of
candied

messy

and
a

fizzy
on

throat

o
not
really
a
fan
of
this
or
really
belgian
ipas
in
general
i
just
dont
find
the
yeast
and
a
big
hop
profile
to
be
very
complementary
on
top
of
that
i
find
this
too
sweet
and
pretty
expensive
at
around
17
for
a
4pack
of
pint
cans
i
mean
thats
more
than
even
marked
up
heady
4packs
i
wish
i
liked
more
stuff
from
vivant
but
most
of
the
stuff
ive
had
from
them
just
hasnt
connected
with
me
absolutely
fantastic
a
great
sweetness
of
tropical
fruit
with
a
mix
of
citrus
and
a
hoppy
pine
like
finish
the
sweetness
nicely
cuts
the
bitterness
and
leaves
you
with
a
perfect
taste
worth
the
18
for
a
4pack
i
bought
3
poured
a
nice
caramel
orange
with
a
billowing
inch
plus
head
which
resolved
to
a
clinging
ring
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
aromas
of
sweet
tropical
fruit
melon

grass
and
yeasty

tiny

is
much
the

with
sweet

and
citrus

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of

bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is

some
malts
tropical
fruits
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
worth
seeking
out
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
belgian
aspect
for
me
but
its
a
solid
take
on
the
style
the
good
are
a
nice
compliment
to
the
yeast
something
that
this
style
normally
misses
by
a
mile
poured
from
the
can
into
a
vivant
can
glass
again
i
got
this
before
i
knew
what
kind
of
people
they
were
clear
amber
color
with
a
billowing
inchplus
of
white
head
which
sank
to
a
thick
ringlet

laced
the

worth
a
couple
sips
but
not
something
that
i
would
purchase
i
really
like
this
its
a
solid
beer
that
ive
purchased
more
than
once
if
you
dont
mind
your
dipas
a
little
sweet
youll
like
this
one
o
again
something
unique
from
this
brewery
i
appreciate
that
they
strive
to
be
different
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
probablky
my
favorite
brewery
vivant
aside
from
the
price
of
a
four
pack
medium
hazed
copper
color
with
a
38
head
of
foam
hoppy
smell
with
a
little
citrus
and
pine
it
had
a
surprisingly
mild
hop
flavor
to
me
for
a
double
ipa
i
prefer
less
citrus
and
was
not
disappointed
as
the
citrus
was
not
the
dominant
flavor
not
too
bitter
i
had
one
glass
prior
to
eating
and
one
glass
with
my
meal
of
tomato
based
jambalaya
and
the
flavor
of
the
beer
did
become
sweeter
with
the
meal
after
finding
the
abv
is
9
7
i
was
surprised
because
it
did
not
have
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
it
is
a
hard
slap
in
the
mouth
but
our
palates
ask
for
more
the
brewer
clearly
put
little
to
no
restraints
on
this
ale
and
were
glad
they
didnt
clearly
more
american
than
belgian
but
its
great
to
have
the
that
house
yeast
edge
to
set
it
apart
from
most
of
the
intensely
hopped
dipas
out
there
o
a
pretty
tasty
brew
but
i
cant
comment
too
much
on
it
as
a
belgian
double
ipa
since
i
just
dont
know
the
style
very
well
it
definitely
has
both
dipa
and
belgian
characteristics
so
in
that
way
they
got
it
right
i
wont
be
sad
to
never
have
it
again
but
definitely
will
enjoy
this
can
o
this
was
a
nice
belgian
ipa
this
was
on
the
sweet
side
and
slightly
expensive
16
ounce
can
into
tulip
glass
no
canning
date
but
is
a
recent
release
pours
slightly
hazy
deep
orange
amber
color
with
a
23
finger
dense
and
fluffy
off
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
spotty
foamy

clings
around
the

aromas
of
tangerine
orange

grapefruit
pineapple
orange

banana
clove

caramel

with
a
fairly
slick
creamy
and
moderately
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
belgian
dipa
all
around
great
complexity
and
balance
of
hop
yeast
ester
and
malt
notes
and
dangerously
smooth
to
sip
on
for
9

a
highly
enjoyable
offering
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
aroma
there
is
sweetness
crispiness
freshness
and
agedness
in
particular
afforded
by
the
inoculated
belgian
yeast
strain
that
at
times
comes
across
as
a
borderline
tart
zestiness
that
conjures
up
thoughts
of
flanders
red
ales
this
comes
across
only
slightly
in
flavoring
but
the
yeast
does
give
an
exotic
bittering
punch
to
the
otherwise
syrupy
sweet
and
caramelladen
dipa
base
laid
before
it
we
do
however
wish
the
hops
were
a
little
more
pronounced
which
would
help
add
freshness
throughout
the
flavoring
and
lingering
aftertaste
this
is
a
fantastic
local
brew
pulling
influence
from
outside
the
state
and
country
for
an
admixture
that
truly
and
authentically
hits
the
spot
a
decent
beer
but
the
flavors
just
dont
work
here
the
belgian
yeast
clashes
with
the
citrus
and
sap
hop
profile
definitely
to
style
but
its
just
not
very
good
excellent
excellent
beer
this
needs
to
be
a
yearrounder
for
brewery
vivant
because
this
is
just
outstanding
and
a
great
alternative
to
the
typical
grapefruitcentric
iipas
on
the
market
brilliantly
crafted
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
this
just
might
be
the
best
belgian
double
ipa
ive
ever
had
it
had
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
the
bitterness
not
being
to
out
of
control
and
the
citrus
and
fruity
hops
were
showcased
nicely
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
not
filling
fairly
refreshing
and
the
flavors
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
without
getting
worn
out
or
bored
with
this
beer
the
flavor
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
its
a
little
dangerous
how
smooth
this
is
for
a
9
7
beer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
pretty
much
everything
there
wasnt
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
about
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
its
not
in
brewery
vivants
regular
lineup
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
buy
this
beer
year
round
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
in
fact
ive
already
went
back
and
got
a
couple
more
and
i
will
buy
a
couple
more
cans
if
its
still
around
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
belgian
ipas
all
in
all
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
since
it
was
from
brewery
vivant
i
expected
it
to
be
good
but
they
really
wowed
me
with
the
hop
profile
complexity
and
balance
of
this
beer
good
work
guys
this
an
awesome
beer
and
its
up
there
as
one
of
the
better
brewery
vivant
beers
i
have
had
this
is
an
extremely
well
crafted
dipa
the
belgian
yeast
mixes
very
well
with
the
hop
profile
of
this
beer
which
by
the
way
is
not
over
the
top
leaving
your
moth
a
barren
wasteland
like
some
other
ipas
this
may
beat
out
thumbprint
iipa
as
my
favorite
go
and
get
some
cans
the
crack
released
a
spurt
of
beer
that
initially
surprised
me
before
i
got
things
under
cantrol
the
glug
produced
anywhere
between
one
to
two
fingers
of
lighttan
head
with
decent
retention
this
was
a
rare
occasion
in
which
i
shared
a
can
with
two
other
people
color
was
solidly
amber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
not
as
intensely
hoppy
as
the
previous
dipa
but
there
were
still
plenty
of
hops
in
evidence
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
thin
especially
for
the
style
taste
was
bitter
and
very
hoppy
but
not
much
beyond
that
i
do
not
mind
unbalanced
but
this
simply
did
not
stand
up
in
comparison
to
the
previous
beer
finish
was
citrusy
more
toward
lemon
than
grapefruit
great
name
soso
beer
overall
this
beer
is
seriously
fucking
delicious
possibly
top
10
beers
ive
ever
had
i
knew
vivant
was
solid
but
between
this
one
and
the
escoffier
bretta
they
are
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
overall
a
damn
good
dipa
one
of
the
best
the
state
of
mi
has
to
offer
seek
this
out
if
you
like
hops
and
well
crafted
beer
cant
really
say
anything
bad
about
this
one
might
be
to
early
to
proclaim
but
this
easily
may
become
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
an
amzing
beer
from
vivant
this
will
be
known
in
the
ipa
field
for
years
to
come
i
will
say
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
vivant
and
will
say
it
is
one
of
the
best
ipas
ive
ever
had
the
smell
is
so
pleasant
i
couldnt
wait
to
drink
it
the
taste
is
so
smooth
that
it
is
hard
to
believe
its
9
3
abv
its
limited
so
be
sure
to
find
it
and
try
before
it
disappears
i
hope
vivant
keeps
this
the
same
for
years
to
come
o
this
is
a
very
well
done
ipa
it
is
loaded
with
citrus
flavors
without
the
bitterness
it
drinks
pretty
easy
for
a
9
7
abv
it
poured
a
dark
cloudy
amber
with
thin
head
left
plenty
of
lace
around
the
snifter
the
smell
hops
in
the
face
floral
citrus
not
noticeably
belgian
i
had
forgotten
it
would
be
a
belgian
ale
so
the
yeast
flavor
in
the
taste
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
citrus
pineapple
bitter
hops
sugar
and
a
little
alcohol
medium
wellcarbonated
and
really
pleasant
its
very
hoppy
and
high
alcohol
so
not
one
to
guzzle
really
nice
i
hope
to
try
this
one
again
overall
this
gets
some
love
i
have
to
say
that
i
notice
that
bv
perhaps
serves
some
of
their
beers
a
bit
too
cold
off
the
tap
things
often
start
out
really
bland
and
just
explode
into
beauty
by
the
end
this
is
always
expected
but
a
few
degrees
warmer
would
do
them
justice
on
brews
like
this
one
it
seems
to
take
an
undue
amount
of
time
for
the
beer
to
make
you
fall
in
love
some
selections
can
afford
to
be
served
more
cold
but
most
of
these
nuanced
selection
need
less
cold
just
my
opinion
nobody
needs
but
first
impressions
are
everything
this
beer
didnt
become
phenomenal
until
it
was
half
gone
and
much
more
warm
it
was
served
at
about
a
3
0
star
flavor
and
finished
at
4
0
stars
the
most
important
thing
is
it
became
phenomenal
bravo
ill
rereview
this
in
a
few
years
if
i
can
find
another
bottle
to
age
and
likely
bump
up

score

do
yourself
a

this
beer
as
most
of
his
are
is
simply
sublime
overall
it
was
a
big
one
rich
fresh
demanding
but
still
smooth
and
well
roundup
as
crazy
and
tiresome
lambics
anyone
the
preparation
of
this
beer
looks
it
has
done
it
good

i
enjoy
it
quite
tasty
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
really
wish
the
taste
followed
the
enticing
aromas
a
little
more
i
was
expecting
more
funkyness
on
the
tongue
overall
very
good
and
recommendable
though
hope
i
get
to
taste
it

easy

crisp
i
wish
i
could

yet
a

beer
one
heck
of
a
ride
this
is
a
wild
ale
more
so
than
a
belgian
ipa
and
im
pleasantly
surprised
that
the
complexity
comes
more
from
the
wine
barrel
aging
and
hops
rather
than
the
brett
bitterness
is
pretty
sharp
and
tartness
is
balanced
the
french
oak
also
rounds
out
the
citra
flavors
nicely
this
is
really
a
stellar
beer
o
i
have
only
tried
a
few
belgian
ipas
and
this
by
far
is
a
great
one
overall
4
5
youve
got
to
be
kidding
me
this
beer
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
gives
me
faith
in
craft
brewingthat
not
everyone
is
doing
their
own
version
of
the
same
old
lineup
that
some
people
are
succeeding
at
executing
the
what
if
fantasy
kind
of
beers
and
doing
it
well
and
that
there
are
brewers
making
beer
thats
essentially
almost
perfect
on
a
regular
basis
absolutely
highly
recommended
and
yes
its
worth
the
price
its
definitely
not
cheap
1820
but
its
absolutely
worth
every
penny
here
with
everything
ive
written
above
no
final
culmination
should
be
necessary
this
could
easily
become
overrun
by
the
brett
over
time
so
id
recommend
having
this
as
fresh
as
possible
the
diversity
of
flavor
as
well
as
the
multilayered
texture
is
what
makes
this
beer
so
damn
refreshing
and
versatile
beer
and
wine
drinkers
alike
must
try
this
when
they
can
o
this
is
really
really
great
lots
of
complex
flavors
much
smoother
finish
than
youd
expect
from
a
100
ibu
belgian
beer
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
definitely
the
gold
standard
for
the
style
ounique
and
delicious
beer
great
for
enjoyable
sipping
would
definitely
seek
this
out
o
this
was
really
really
good
excellent
beer
lots
of
hop
flavor
but
still
blends
very
well
with
all
the
wonderful
brett
characteristics
brought
out
here
absolutely
love
this
one
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
hazy
medium
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
stays
as
a
fine
thick
film
with
lacing
aroma
of
brett
white
wine
apple
light
citrus
and
light
grassy
hops
flavor
is
also
distinctive
brett
lemon
tangerine
stone
fruit
mildly
vinous
light
coriander
finishes
very
dry
with
brett
and
lingering
hop
bitterness
with
no
distinct
hop
flavor
medium
bodied
with
peppery
active
carbonation
the
yeast
strain
here
leans
more
towards
a
saison
yeast
than
belgian
but
there
are
light
belgian
yeast
and
spicing
elements
present
in
the
complex
flavor
this
is
almos
too
dry
for
me
but
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
really
made
this
enjoyable
to
drink
dryness
and
light
vinousness
gives
it
a
champagne
like
character
if
champagne
had
brett
nicely
made
and
interesting
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
an
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
lots
of
spicy
yeast
citrus
pepper
grass
grape
oak
and
lemon
pepper
and
yeast
hit
the
palate
first
followed
by
faint
hints
of
pine
lemon
and
apricot
the
aftertaste
is
most
interesting
grape
oak
lemon
green
apple
and
notes
of
peach
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fascinating
beer
i
have
never
had
anything
like
bitter
monk
but
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
soon
o
incredible
one
of
the
best
brett
beers
ive
ever
had
when
a
beers
this
great
theres
nothing
more
to
say
but
wow
o
this
is
my
favorite
anchorage
brew
by
a
longshot
thus
far
the
complexity
of
this
one
is
immaculate
every
sip
is
a
little
different
hoppy
yet
funky
big
fan
mouthfeeloverall
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
the
brett
funk
and
bitterness
on
the
back
end
lends
to
a
dry
finish
that
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
deal
the
hop
character
and
funk
blend
perfectly
together
and
create
a
great
product
easily
the
best
belgian
ipa
i
have
tried
to
this
point
o
easily
worth
the
price
i
am
impressed
by
the
complexity
of
this
beer
sometimes
to
much
of
a
good
thing
is
a
bad
thing
but
this
was
all
great
tart
then
sweet
with
a
serious
sour
bitter
yet
overall
sweet
and
fruity
experience
for
710
sec
how
does
the
man
do
it
when
i
think
about
the
only
other
brew
ive
had
from
anchorage
was
another
serious
winner
and
i
think
i
dropped
the
5
on
the
galaxy
ipas
nose
as
well
id
love
to
have
several
of
these
to
sit
on
and
drink
periodically
but
i
have
a
feeling
i
caught
it
at
a
good
age
today
o
a
pretty
awesome
beer
very
different
and
well
done
bottle
from
tipples

pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
small
white
head
aroma
of
lemon
zest
pineapple
dry
oak
brett
orange
peel
very
interesting
flavor
is
big
pineapple
juice
with
definite
brett
presence
and
lingering
oak
and
pineapple
bitter
is
there
for
sure
juicy
balanced
by
the
effervescent
mouthfeel
which
makes
it
feel
light
on
the
palate
for
a
dipa
very
unique
beer
that
delivers
on
the
flavors
it
advertises
wow
wow
wow
wow
i
had
never
had
an
anchorage
beer
before
but
had
heard
good
things
but
this
beer
impressed
the
hell
out
of
me
im
a
fan
of
brett
and
this
beer
a
belgian
ipa
with
brett
is
definitely
dominated
by
the
funkiness
its
missing
the
harsh
leathery
aspects
of
a
lot
of
other
brett
beers
and
is
instead
light
and
fluffy
the
color
is
amazing
bright
and
strawcolored
so
unbelievably
tasty
with
rich
citrus
flavors
a
bit
of
oakiness
but
mostly
that
brett
even
at
15bottle
i
would
gladly
have
as
many
as
i
could
drink
alright
after
trying
a
yearold
galaxy
white
ipa
and
now
this
four
month
old
bitter
monk
im
glad
to
say
that
anchorage
are
singlehandedly
providing
a
reason
for
that
terrible
mishmash
of
styles
known
as
a
belgian
ipa
to
exist
the
flavor
profile
is
nearly
perfect
the
brett
and
the
slight
butteriness
from
the
chardonnay
barrels
do
very
interesting
things
with
the
heavy
fruity
hopping
and
oak
lightly
sour
at
first
some
more
influence
from
the
hops
quickly
rushes
in
with
the
yeast
and
oak
providing
a
strong
backbone
for
the
finish
much
like
the
galaxy
white
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
dry
because
of
the
whole
brett
lots
of
hops
thing
an
exceptional
beer
anchorages
belgian
ipas
are
so
good
they
make
everybody
else
trying
the
style
look
like
amateurs
as
good
as
the
style
gets
overall
very
solid
beer
almost
great
probably
the
best
beer
that
ive
had
in
this
style
if
you
slapped
an
import
label
and
told
me
it
was
from
belgium
i
wouldnt
have
any
reason
not
to
believe
you
on
taste
alone
great
balance
and
a
must
try
overall
this
is
a
great
marriage
of
belgian
and
american
brewing
traditions
so
far
my
favorite
beer
by
anchorage
i
dont
love
a
lot
of
beers
but
i
love
this
one
i
cant
imagine
anything
that
would
make
it
much
better
ale
aslyum
chalice
lot
of
great
things
involved
here
citra
hops
brett
french
oak
chardonnay
barrels
i
love
all
of
those
things
and
naturally
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
great
very
lush
fruit
profile
papaya
melon
mango
citrus
lemon
both
the
barrel
and
the
brett
are
great
compliments
to
the
hops
everything
marries
quite
well
well
i
have
had
the
bitter
monk
before
many
a
time
but
i
am
finally
reviewing
it
since
i
just
polished
off
a
bottle
and
man
is
it
as
good
as
i
remember
i
like
my
dipas
to
be
a
bighter
color
than
the
typical
burnt
orange
haziness
of
many
and
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
sunshine
yellow
brassy
hue
w
ridiculous
head
retention
im
talking
over
an
hour
and
there
was
still
a
rim
on
my
friends
glass
but
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
truly
heavenly
for
a
hop
head
it
starts
out
with
that
brett
sour
apple
turning
into
barnyard
scent
which
is
then
replaced
by
grapefruit
passion
fruit
mango
hop
phenols
and
finishes
with
a
hit
of
oaky
leather
the
taste
is
just
as
good
brett
flavors
are
forward
with
a
center
of
this
beer
is
pure
hoppy
goodness
with
a
lingering
barrel
finish
that
is
very
very
dry
this
dryness
was
amazing
for
the
taste
but
did
hurt
the
feel
of
the
beer
slightly
and
it
could
have
been
more
carbonated
the
top
did
fly
off
though
all
in
all
hard
to
find
fault
with
this
one
a
great
beer
that
really
is
proud
to
represent
the
style
of
belgian
ipa
god
gabe
is
good
supple
feel
juicy
and
medium
bodied
very
fruit
forward
resiny
bitter
aftertaste
complex
and
unique
a
slight
brett
presence
but
its
in
the
background
very
tasty
highly
recommended
i
havent
explored
very
many
belgianstyle
ipas
but
this
is
an
absolutely
stellar
beer
im
definitely
going
to
look
for
other
examples
of
this
style
in
the
future
and
im
really
looking
forward
to
trying
some
other
beers
from
anchorage
whose
distribution
to
my
area
started
not
too
long
ago
i
just
love
the
combination
of
bitter
and
sour
in
this
beer
you
know
there
is
sweetness
there
too
otherwise
the
beverage
would
be
undrinkable
but
its
buried
under
the
other
flavors
its
not
that
often
i
drink
a
beer
and
think
wow
thats
something
i
havent
tasted
before
nicely
done
anchorage
overall
terrific
the
mixture
of
brett
and
citra
is
lovely
i
find
the
belgian
aspect
of
the
beer
to
not
be
a
focus
comes
across
more
like
a
bretty
american
ipa
because
the
citra
is
so
much
stronger
than
the
belgian
yeast
whatever
you
call
it
it
is
delicious
and
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
i
have
ever
encountered
the
beer
pours
just
cloudy
with
a
white
fluffy
head
aroma
has
citrus
lemon
and
floral
funk
from
the
brett
despite
being
a
year
old
there
is
a
significant
and
wonderful
hop
bitterness
to
the
beer
and
the
brett
has
built
up
with
age
the
alcohol
is
balanced
by
present
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
form
of
aggressive
tiny
bubbles
but
that
didnt
bother
me
in
terms
of
drinkability
medium
body
that
is
never
syrupy
which
can
be
an
issue
in
double
ipas
flavor
has
orange
and
lemon
peel
spices
couldnt
mistake
this
for
anything
but
a
belgian
beer
brett
yeast
and
still
a
bit
of
pineresin
it
is
quite
dry
and
absolutely
delicious
there
is
a
ton
to
work
through
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
beer
but
unfortunately
it
tastes
so
damn
good
that
youll
be
hard
pressed
to
take
your
time
another
imaginative
triumph
from
anchorage
brewing
company
it
really
is
equal
parts
belgian
ale
and
dipa
i
experienced
the
duality
myself
jeez
abc
should
really
expand
their
distribution
and
make
their
offerings
easier
to
find
cause
pretty
much
everything
ive
tried
from
them
this
year
has
been
totally
unique
and
at
least
somewhat
mindblowing
if
not
mindexploding
overall
a
beer
that
ive
been
seeking
for
the
better
part
of
six
months
due
to
how
much
i
love
everything
that
comes
out
of
anchorage
it
seems
this
one
isnt
my
favorite
of
their
offerings
but
its
darn
close
and
its
one
that
i
really
wish
i
could
have
tried
fresh
it
seems
like
the
time
has
allowed
the
balance
to
flip
from
hop
dominant
with
brett
elements
to
the
inverse
o
im
not
generally
a
fan
of
this
style
although
ive
had
a
bit
of
rayon
vert
that
i
loved
the
category
for
belgian
style
dipa
aged
in
chardonnay
barrels
is
pretty
slim
i
think
but
this
beer
is
exceptional
by
any
standard
it
didnt
convert
me
to
brett
beers
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
experience
and
i
learned
some
things
by
drinking
it
almost
every
taste
is
different
it
is
such
a
fun
beer
to
drink
but
better
to
share
it
became
tough
to
tackle
the
entire
750
ml
because
it
is
such
a
big
beer
the
9
is
well
hidden
but
the
strong
flavors
attack
the
palate
i
think
this
drinks
like
a
citra
dipa
vs
a
saison
you
absolutely
get
the
chardonnay
as
it
warms
i
get
the
hop
punch
on
the
front
end
but
it
fades
into
the
orangespice
notes
im
sure
some
of
this
has
to
do
with
the
nearly
year
old
bottle
but
it
held
up
magnificently
this
beer
would
be
a
great
3
yr
vertical
as
it
is
bottle
conditioned
worth
seeking
out
especially
for
a
bottle
share
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
interesting
hue
nice
head
and
some
solid
lacing
nose
is
hay
and
wheat
with
fruit
and
spice
components
yeasty
and
hoppy
with
citrus
and
spice
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
fondly
remembered
greatly
missed
it
comes
close
to
what
i
would
call
a
thinkin
beer
the
retention
is
clumpy
the
lacing
is
sticky
the
smell
of
the
beer
gets
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
there
are
aromas
of
lemon
citrus
and
orange

triple
fermentation
my
3rd
beer
from
anchorage
earthshattering
fruit
this
was
really
different
the
brew
started
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
and
tart
citrus
with
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
from
the
brett
it
was
really
light
bodywise
for
a
belgian
ipa
and
the
booze
and
ibus
are
really
wellbalanced
out
by
the
flavors
the
finish
was
relatively
quick
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
body
was
probably
the
lightest
that
ive
ever
had
with
a
good
dollop
of
carbonation
this
beer
was
just
fantastic
to
me
it
was
an
easy
drinker
despite
the
abv
and
was
complex
and
quaffable
i
would
definitely
have
this
bad
boy
again

this
is

smells

amazing

taste
follows
the

great
citrusy
taste
with
plenty
of

a
little

from

would

this

luscious
feel
as
advertized
this
is
a
real
winner
if
youre
any
kind
of
fan
of
this
style
i
can
agree
with
some
of
the
other
reviewers
that
this
may
not
be
a
classic
belgian
ipa
but
not
great
i
was
expecting
more
of
the
brett
and
belgian
aspects
to
stand
in
the
forefront
d
very
drinkable
the
combination
of
dipa
level
of
hops
belgian
yeast
brett
and
some
oak
aged
barrel
aging
comes
together
to
create
a
complex
and
very
well
balanced
beer
super
drinkable
o
a
great
belgian
brett
pale
ale
but
knocked
down
by
the
advertised
dipa
yes
i
know
it
was
old
6
mo
but
i
didnt
know
that
when
i
bought
it
due
to
a
lack
of
bottling
date
not
hoppy
enough
but
i
sense
the
bitterness
wow
dense
flavors
complex
heady
stuff
love
the
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
more
intense
and
most
well
crafted
versions
get
some
stinky
cheese
peppery
salads
spicy
thai
food
or
whatever
you
like
to
eat
and
enjoy
every
sip
of
this
one
o
a
very
good
beer
with
incredible
complexity
and
depth
hops
arent
entirely
gone
but
could
only
imagine
what
some
fresh
hop
character
would
add
to
this
beer
hopefully
we
will
all
see
this
one
again
one
day
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
belgian
style
ale
i
was
a
bit
fan
of
the
herbal
notes
i
think
the
hops
have
faded
but
i
am
still
a
fan
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresher
if
they
bring
out
another
batch
o
i
really
badmouth
this
style
but
this
beer
outdoes
the
others
tenfold
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
but
no
gaurantee
being
imported
from
alaska
i
suppose
even
so
this
beer
was
incredible
the
hops
were
pretty
much
gone
but
it
didnt
matter
theres
enough
going
on
in
this
beer
to
make
it
great
nothing
clashes
either
very
well
done
love
the
label
and
spiel
and
pours
a
hazy
yellow
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
creamy
head
and
lots
of
lacingthe
smell

cheers
o
very
good
i
wish
it
was
fresher
but
it
tastes
very
good
at
its
current
state
very
smooth
and
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
edit
for
2013
edition
perfect
and
consistent
in
every
way
this
is
no
one
off
wonder
its
the
real
deal
750ml
bottle
12
99
i
have
been
passing
this
by
despite
the
rave
reviews
because
it
was
15
99
i
saw
it
on
sale
and
thought
i
was
getting
a
deal
so
i
bought
it
yes
i
am
a
sucker
but
this
really
is
quite
a
good
beer
bright
yellow
orange
color
and
a
huge
rocky
head
looks
good
the
smell
instantly
reminded
me
of
russian
river
temptation
heavy
chardonnay
and
brett
i
think
there
was
a
hint
of
citrus
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
again
made
me
think
of
temptation
and
it
must
be
that
chardonnay
and
brett
combo
working
so
well
there
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
here
from
the
hops
and
just
the
faintest
hint
of
citrus
i
have
to
wonder
what
the
hops
were
like
when
this
was
fresh
since
this
was
apparently
brewed
back
in
july
of
2011
but
the
hops
are
not
completely
gone
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
i
can
see
why
everyone
likes
it
so
much
this
started
out
a
bit
dull
but
at
a
warm
temperature
the
citrus
hops
really
shined
it
easily
topped
the
midnight
sun
3767
for
me
great
beer
cheers
o
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
to
this
point
and
rightfully
so
given
all
the
different
techniques
ingredients
and
blending
of
styles
going
into
this
beer
for
such
a
big
beer
i
was
very
impressed
by
how
balanced
and
drinkable
it
was
while
packing
a
creative
and
complex
flavor
profile
a
real
treat
would
definitely
have
again
the
brett
is
once
again
very
potent
in
this
ale
threatening
to
dominate
the
flavor
profile
if
not
for
the
massive
contrapunal
force
of
the
bittering
hops
not
sure
amidst
this
what
the
barrel
aging
contributes
quite
a
big
beer
though
which
should
appeal
to
hopheads
who
are
fond
of
funk
though
it
may
alienate
everyone
else
o
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
here
but
really
enjoyed
it
love
the
mix
of
hops
and
funk
very
much
liked
this
and
a
big
thanks
to
scott
for
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
we
split
the
yeast
amongst
us
and
its
sat
curtainlike
in
each
of
our
glasses
in
suspension
looked
pretty
cool
voluminous
white
head
very
effervescent
with
a
great
rocky
head
and
spotty
lacing
nose
has
pungent
lemon
funkbrett
white
wine
notes
pine
a
touch
of
cat
pee
citrus
zest
and
background
tropical
notes
derived
from
the
citra
ill
guess
alot
of
grassy
notes
as
well
somewhat
of
a
noble
hop
character
to
it
certainly
extremely
unique
for
a
dipa
taste
again
has
substantial
lemon
tropical
fruits
with
light
tart
and
vinousbarrel
notes
herbal
hops
again
with
less
brett
than
the
nose
light
spiciness
in
the
finish
certainly
a
solid
amount
of
belgian
and
brett
flavours
all
around
works
phenomenally
with
the
hop
profile
bitterness
is
there
but
not
overpowering
fantastic
and
ill
most
certainly
seek
out
future
batches
if
given
the
chance
overall
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
offering
very
complex
and
delicious
it
really
blends
several
of
styles
together
to
achieve
a
very
pleasant
result
with
all
of
my
favorite
characteristics
in
one
beer
glad
i
still
have
one
bottle
left
but
i
am
not
sure
how
long
i
will
want
to
let
that
one
age
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
complex
beer
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
some
time
now
and
happened
to
stumble
upon
it
at
my
local
bottle
shop
this
evening
i
grumbled
at
the
price
tag
but
now
im
glad
i
ponied
up
the
17
bottle
price
its
worth
every
sip
i
can
confidently
say
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
that
ive
had
in
a
very
long
time
superbly
brewed
and
considering
the
unique
complexity
dare
i
say
superbly
engineered
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
its
adventurous
but
if
you
really
dig
super
dry
belgian
beers
with
brett
funk
and
you
enjoy
intense
citrus
bitterness
from
citra
hops
this
is
a
must
try
im
going
back
for
another
bottle
of
this
stuff
i
wish
that
i
could
have
gotten
to
this
one
a
little
fresher
but
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
the
hops
still
packed
a
flavorful
punch
here
blending
in
wonderfully
with
the
brett
and
barrel
notes
to
form
a
beautiful
marriage
of
flavors
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
its
damn
tasty
overall
one
if
not
the
best
belgian
ipa
i
have
had
i
can
only
knock
it
5
for
price
15
a
bottle
and
mouthfeel
but
i
would
gladly
buy
another
bottle
when
the
newest
batch
comes
out
this
year
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
bitter
and
enjoyable
with
a
pleasant
depth
of
flavors
the
alcohol
is
integrated
pretty
well
the
contrast
of
dry
brettd
wood
flavors
and
hoppy
bitterness
worked
in
this
offering
at
5
months
old
id
say
this
is
holding
up
pretty
well
an
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
further
developes
easily
one
of
the
best
ipas
ive
tried
a
fantastic
belgian
ipa
this
one
is
unlike
any
ive
ever
tried
before
its
both
far
more
complex
and
far
more
bitter
than
any
other
example
ive
tried
within
the
style
superb
o
right
out
the
gate
this
anchorage
brewing
co
is
doing
some
amazing
things
complex
funky
and
delicious
i
cant
wait
to
see
whats
next
bloody
excellent
beer
i
dont
know
anything
about
this
brewery
but
this
is
simply
fantastic
gorgeously
complex
but
even
better
complex
in
a
way
that
all
the
tastes
complement
one
another
continually
wow
o
absolutely
stellar
beer
one
of
if
not
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
had
would
love
to
have
again
preferably
super
fresh
might
try
and
trade
for
this
down
the
road
very
refreshing
and
perfectly
balanced
brett
funk
hv
a
little
disappointed
by
this
one
especially
after
the
appearance
and
aroma
the
belgian
yeast
cuts
through
all
the
other
flavors
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
yeast
in
a
lighter
ale
very
complex
and
definitely
interesting
but
just
an
ok
taste
bitter
monk
is
a
very
unique
beer
and
i
applaud
the
folks
at
anchorage
brewing
company
in
their
efforts
to
push
boundaries
however
the
combination
of
intense
brett
oak
and
bitter
hops
was
a
lot
to
deal
with
as
was
the
18
price
tag
i
would
recommend
splitting
up
a
bottle
amongst
multiple
drinkers
as
consuming
this
beer
in
quantity
can
become
a
bit
overwhelming
overall
i
like
it
the
best
beligan
ipa
ive
had
i
like
the
use
of
brett
instead
of
traditional
belgian
yeast
it
also
has
good
noticeable
bitterness
only
downside
is
price
at
17
a
bottle
lots
of
citrus
flavor
in
the
start
of
each
sip
with
a
bitter
funkiness
behind
dry
aftertaste
with
lingering
acrid
bitterness
delicious
strong
carbonation
with
a
peppery
bite
on
my
tongue
this
tastes
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
possibly
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
medium
bodied
above
average
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
i
very
well
disguised
a
very
nice
belgian
ipa
too
bad
this
is
meant
to
only
be
brewed
one
time
wow
what
a
beer
i
had
seen
these
beers
at
whole
foods
and
total
wine
for
the
last
month
but
the
price
had
really
driven
me
off
after
seeing
some
threads
on
reddits
beer
forum
piling
on
the
high
praise
i
figured
id
drop
13
on
it
and
give
it
a
shot
and
what
a
beer
this
is
this
beer
has
a
shit
ton
going
on
in
it
but
i
think
this
cacophony
ends
up
working
out
definitely
worth
getting
at
least
once
im
thinking
about
about
buying
another
bottle
or
two
to
age
and
see
what
it
is
like
once
it
has
a
few
years
on
it
and
once
the
hops
have
died
down
this
was
a
very
good
beer
share
it
with
a
friend
to
avoid
getting
it
to
warm
o
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
love
love
love
this
beer
oit
was
overall
a
very
interesting
and
funky
smooth
beer
one
i
would
like
to
try
on
tap
fresh
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
pick
it
up
again
in
a
bottle
because
of
the
price
it
was
definitely
a
beer
geek
type
of
beer
because
it
was
really
complex
but
interesting
at
the
same
time
cheers
and
happy
holidays
overall
really
nice
the
blending
of
fresh
tropical
fruit
hops
bitterness
fruity
brett
biter
dry
funk
and
barnyard
etc
done
very
well
delicious
and
smooth
dry
bitter
finish
and
all
that
with
a
nice
chardonnay
wine
flavor
i
could
drink
lots
of
this
if
it
was
much
cheaper
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
personally
got
a
ton
of
brett
funk
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
it
was
carbonated
accordingly
and
was
a
really
really
fine
drink
i
didnt
get
a
ton
from
the
chardonnay
barrels
that
i
know
of
though
im
sure
its
a
flavor
in
there
that
im
tasting
but
not
discerning
i
would
gladly
pay
the
12
for
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
overall
an
excellent
brew
i
will
definitely
keep
and
eye
out
for
anchorage
brewing
companys
beers
pours
a
hazy
golden
yelow
with
a
georgeous
three
finger
bright
white
head
that
never
really
goes
away
just
settles
to
a
frothy
cap
with
tons
of
sticky
lacing
smell
is
amazing
there
is
sweet
malts
and
hops
mixed
with
the
funk
of
brett
and
topped
off
with
a
nice
chardonnay
aroma
taste
is
also
pleasing
you
get
all
the
flavors
that
the
nose
picked
up
and
they
blend
beautifuly
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
medium
bodied
creamy
feel
with
nice
level
of
carbonation
you
also
have
a
long
dry
bitter
finish
from
the
100
ibus
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
they
toned
down
the
ibus
and
turned
this
dipa
into
a
saison
o
overall
wow
this
beer
is
amazing
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
wish
i
had
more
as
this
is
a
delicious
beer
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
as
thus
is
a
great
blend
of
style
o
a
solid
brew
a
unique
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
and
it
really
seemed
to
work
for
me
the
tropical
fruity
bitter
funk
is
something
i
like
and
would
have
more
often
at
9
i
couldnt
plow
through
this
as
much
as
id
like
to
very
unique
and
enjoyable
verdict
amazing
flavors
big
yeast
notes
and
hops
of
a
traditional
belgian
ipa
taken
for
an
amazing
ride
with
the
addition
of
brett
a
sour
ipa
that
really
hits
the
mark
highly
recommended
for
any
hop
head
or
belgian
lover
very
intense
definitely
would
never
be
a
goto
of
anything
but
will
definitely
try
to
get
another
bottle
or
two
to
share
with
some
folks
who
would
get
it
makes
you
have
think
about
it
as
your
drinking
750
ml
bottle
pourd
a
hazy
gold
with
a
lasting
off
white
head
aromas
of
straw
barnyard
funk
lemon
light
white
grape
and
light
oak
palate
was
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
flavors
of
strawbarnyard
funk
lemon
earthiness
light
white
grapes
and
a
hint
of
oiak
with
a
crisp
dry
bitter
lingering
funky
citrus
finish
othis
beer
was
good
but
i
was
not
that
into
it
it
is
pretty
drinkable
for
what
it
is
but
i
think
it
is
a
one
try
beer
for
me
o
a
great
and
different
brew
that
i
loved
for
the
style
loads
of
tastes
melded
together
whoa
pricey
beer
however
glad
i
tried
it
before
it
was
gone
and
it
was
definitely
great
to
share
there
is
a
lot
of
tasty
citra
hops
and
a
well
complimenting
belgian
yeast
character
soooo
overall
its
15
well
spent
but
still
not
my
thing
so
i
probably
would
pass
on
a
round
2
light
body
with
some
zesty
but
refreshing
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
keep
the
tongue
clean
of
the
massive
hops
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
this
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
due
to
the
amount
of
hop
bitterness
an
interesting
beer
but
this
may
be
overly
bitter
for
my
palate
as
it
overwhelms
much
of
the
yeast
and
malt
character
that
a
belgian
ipa
should
have
on
the
tongue
certainly
enjoyably
just
to
much
soapy
hops
for
my
liking
i
wish
more
barrel
and
bretty
yeast
would
come
out
a
one
time
purchase
overall
a
quality
beer
the
brett
sourness
and
bitterness
blend
very
nicely
and
the
other
flavors
balance
out
the
beer
very
well
looking
forward
to
some
more
beers
from
anchorage
brewing
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
tasted
this
year
and
i
mean
that
as
a
compliment
bitter
monk
fills
the
glass
with
a
bright
yellow
look
with
some
deep
gold
tints
in
certain
spots
a
nice
bright
white
billowy
foamy
head
of
foam
graces
the
top
leaving
droppings
on
the
glass
sheets
even
smell
is
heavenly
the
brett
is
right
up
there
and
fills
the
nostrils
citrus
hop
aroma
is
amped
up
as
well
as
lemon
the
char
does
not
really
come
through
some
bubblegum
scent
wit
some
integration
on
first
sips
i
can
tell
this
is
big
beer
its
bold
bitter
and
somewhat
abrasive
without
going
overt
the
hill
lemon
citra
hop
flavor
grapefruit
brett
make
up
the
flavor
profile
i
dont
get
any
char
and
the
oak
is
faint
if
there
at
all
the
lemon
and
bitterness
last
for
a
while
afterwards
bold
feel
is
a
healthy
medium
with
a
whole
lot
of
carb
that
sparks
this
beer
causes
tingles
on
my
tounge
a
great
beer
that
delivers
on
everything
on
the
bottle
sand
huge
barrel
flavor
yet
drinking
this
now
too
much
of
that
may
have
killed
what
make
this
stand
out
beer
starts
off
with
great
flavor
and
complexity
comes
on
nicely
as
you
delve
deeper
into
its
flavors
good
crisp
body
boozy
but
not
in
your
face
with
it
i
know
a
lot
of
folks
dont
like
this
style
but
i
see
some
real
opportunity
here
with
this
guy
calibelgique
and
urthely
hopit
being
three
of
my
favorite
beers
and
so
vastly
different
within
the
same
subcategory
o
i
think
the
look
and
smell
of
this
beer
are
amazing
but
the
taste
falls
a
bit
short
for
my
liking
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
ultra
dryness
of
this
beer
either
but
overall
its
still
a
decent
brew
overall
this
was
my
favorite
beer
drinking
experience
at
the
bodega
in
lacrosse
over
thanksgiving
weekend
so
glad
that
they
continue
to
bring
in
amazing
beers
i
really
had
no
idea
this
type
of
beer
could
be
done
a
brett
barrel
aged
dipa
that
being
said
they
certainly
got
it
done
extremely
well
up
in
anchorage
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
even
though
i
paid
25
for
the
bomber
at
a
bar
heck
it
was
thanksgiving
and
i
couldnt
resist
beside
the
chardonnay
barrels
adding
maybe
a
touch
too
much
and
creating
a
little
too
much
going
on
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
style
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
again
in
the
future
and
maybe
brewing
myself
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
and
the
only
comparison
i
could
make
was
to
iron
hills
savage
ipa
still
its
definitely
a
unique
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
and
flavor
a
very
well
made
beer
theres
something
about
this
combination
of
belgianbrett
yeasts
and
ipa
that
i
enjoy
when
its
done
right
and
the
french
oak
adds
an
interesting
component
that
tends
to
bring
everything
together
i
am
really
glad
i
found
another
beer
like
3767
since
i
enjoyed
that
so
much
however
at
15
99
per
750ml
im
not
sure
how
often
id
revisit
this
o
this
is
unlike
anything
ive
ever
tasted
totally
unique
and
very
delicious
i
always
love
it
when
a
brewer
comes
out
with
a
beer
that
is
unique
this
is
one
of
those
really
unable
to
fully
explain
it
a
tasty
beer
that
is
worth
buying
and
buying
try
this
beer
hopefully
the
other
beers
from
this
brewery
will
be
just
as
good
cloudy
light
orange
body
topped
by
a
thick
rocky
white
head
that
falls
quickly
the
citrusy
hop
aroma
slips
into
piney
grassy
farm
notes
where
the
line
between
brett
and
hop
blurs
the
high
carbonation
makes
it
almost
chewy
as
it
moves
from
lips
to
throat
theres
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
lemony
flavors
becoming
bready
then
slightly
briney
leaving
a
dry
aftertaste
thats
half
sour
half
bitter
you
can
feel
the
oak
in
your
jowls
this
is
a
complex
beersimply
wonderful
bomber
from
bierkraft
pours
up
hazy
fruity
coloured
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
retained
head
funky
aroma
it
all
works
the
brett
the
barreling
with
fruity
nuances
the
hopping
easy
mouthfeel
and
a
pleasant
drinker
as
i
finished
it
all
over
an
hours
lunch
o
easy
drinker
funky
ass
brett
i
love
this
yeast
when
done
well
this
is
middle
of
the
pack
brett
beer
which
makes
it
excellent
like
it
certainly
o
overall
i
love
this
beer
for
the
experiment
that
it
is
but
dont
particularly
adore
drinking
it
it
is
a
challenge
to
quaff
and
would
score
low
in
drinkability
that
said
i
think
is
ends
up
being
a
brilliant
beer
overall
because
ive
never
had
anything
like
it
and
at
the
same
time
it
didnt
fall
flat
on
its
face
it
really
excites
the
taste
buds
im
very
interested
to
see
what
mr
fletcher
has
up
his
sleeve
in
the
future
this
almost
tastes
like
something
vinnie
at
rr
would
cook
up
but
perhaps
without
the
restraint
needed
to
make
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
as
usual
i
got
my
hopes
up
and
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
didnt
turn
out
to
be
the
knockout
i
was
hoping
but
still
a
very
good
beer
that
is
relatively
unique
from
others
in
the
style
i
actually
dont
mind
the
brett
too
much
in
this
pretty
refreshing
in
a
wine
like
way
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
though
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
probably
wont
grab
it
again
d
this
beer
was
terrific
im
guessing
its
loosely
based
on
3767
which
gabe
made
while
at
midnight
sun
very
easy
to
dirnk
even
with
the
higher
abv
and
ibus
the
bitterness
is
apparent
but
never
gets
fatiguing
or
oppressive
i
hope
shelton
windy
city
get
their
act
together
and
we
get
the
next
batch
a
little
quicker
as
id
like
to
experience
the
full
force
of
the
hop
aroma
and
flavors
o
this
beer
is
shockingly
unique
and
good
at
the
same
time
need
to
revisit
it
as
there
is
so
much
going
on
one
of
the
more
interestingly
complexed
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
while
im
not
necessarily
a
fan
of
this
style
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
alex
and
i
drank
the
bottle
pretty
easily
between
us
o
an
amazing
beer
a
great
hybrid
of
styles
that
works
to
almost
perfection
would
definitely
enjoy
this
beer
again
it
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
more
anchorage
beers
the
bottle
is
pretty
amazing
looking
too
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
cellar
for
a
few
months
and
see
how
much
more
the
brett
develops
this
brew
lives
up
to
the
billing
it
is
tremendously
bitter
and
heavily
belgianesque
in
character
bitter
monk
pours
a
surprisingly
pale
translucent
golden
hue
topped
with
a
very
healthy
white
cap
of
rocky
froth
the
nose
is
pungently
bitter
with
notes
of
heavy
grapefruit
pith
and
elderflower
being
highly
prominent
the
bitter
applepineapple
flavor
imparted
by
the
brett
pairs
well
with
the
hop
addition
as
they
mimic
one
anothers
flavor
in
some
ways
i
keep
thinking
this
is
very
much
like
cantillons
mamouche
or
like
an
elderflower
ipa
the
pale
malt
base
is
evocative
of
the
classic
orval
or
duvel
approach
there
is
no
caramel
to
be
found
here
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
effervescent
and
thereby
bordering
on
prickly
though
it
is
not
offensive
id
have
preferred
a
softer
feel
that
said
in
every
way
this
is
a
challenging
asskicking
type
of
beer
so
the
feel
is
in
that
vein
as
well
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
probably
the
best
ive
had
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
hazed
peach
color
with
a
large
fluffy
white
crown
that
left
multiple
rings
of
broken
lace
as
it
settled
into
a
frothy
massjust
a
great
pour
citric
hops
are
huge
along
with
the
brett
adding
slight
funki
even
picked
up
a
little
nutty
maltiness
in
there
as
well
powerful
citric
hop
along
with
light
yeasty
funkinessbut
its
not
overbearinga
little
medicinal
as
well
wich
i
normally
dont
like
but
it
didnt
bother
me
so
much
here
this
is
a
damn
well
crafted
beeri
was
a
little
worried
i
might
not
take
to
it
as
well
with
the
brettbut
i
got
mad
love
for
this
brew
notes
hmmm
that
anchorage
brewing
is
making
a
nice
dent
with
breatty
and
barrel
aged
brews
is
clear
quality
and
very
likable
now
if
i
get
fuzzy
on
this
one
i
might
be
getting
so
spoiled
that
it
feels
a
touch
perfunctory
i
mean
dunno
i
would
not
mind
having
a
go
at
a
regular
dipa
from
theirs
here
so
much
plays
with
the
belgian
yeast
the
barrel
the
brett
that
it
all
has
a
bizarre
predictable
sense
under
all
the
great
serving
having
said
all
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
takes
if
not
the
best
i
have
had
at
a
double
belgian
ipa
nevermind
me
o
this
is
a
fantastic
belgian
ipa
and
one
of
the
absolute
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
wow
i
popped
the
cork
on
this
beer
and
a
funkysweet
aroma
just
filled
the
room
instantly
kind
of
hazy
beer
nothing
to
exceptional
however
this
beer
tastes
like
nothing
else
ive
ever
had
its
rich
and
buttery
from
the
chardonnay
barrels
its
super
sour
and
it
has
just
a
hint
of
bite
from
all
the
hops
absolutely
crazy
beer
that
seems
just
thrown
together
but
is
utterly
fantastic
in
the
end
i
sound
like
a
broken
record
but
this
is
a
really
crazy
beer
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
if
you
like
taking
a
palate
adventure
when
you
drink
beer
this
is
the
beer
for
you
so
hoppy
so
tart
and
so
creamy
very
interesting
and
highly
recommended
overall
this
was
definitely
an
experience
for
sure
the
flavors
and
aromas
were
so
contradictory
and
yet
complemented
each
other
quite
well
my
only
issue
was
that
i
wish
i
consume
this
during
the
warmer
months
as
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
much
more
on
a
nice
warm
day
if
you
love
sour
beers
and
really
bitter
dipas
you
will
love
this
if
you
dislike
either
pass
i
am
on
the
fence
as
i
like
both
but
i
think
i
prefer
them
separate
still
a
high
quality
beer
as
this
obviously
took
a
lot
of
thought
and
care
to
craft
such
an
intricate
brew
if
you
can
afford
the
elevated
price
tag
its
worth
a
go
o
this
beer
is
ridiculously
good
who
would
have
thought
a
sour
ipa
would
be
a
good
idea
o
this
is
my
favorite
beer
i
was
completely
blown
away
although
it
was
very
different
from
what
i
expected
based
on
the
description
for
some
reason
i
was
picturing
a
much
more
malt
forward
and
biggersweeter
beer
considering
the
label
as
a
belgian
iipa
with
barrel
aging
but
no
dry
balanced
and
crazy
complex
with
a
damnnear
perfect
hop
forward
bitterness
mostly
funky
but
nicely
sour
brett
character
and
a
malt
backdrop
enhanced
by
the
belgian
yeast
without
being
heavily
fruity
spicy
or
sweet
big
shoutout
goes
out
to
my
doppelganger
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
served
from
bottle
into
a
bells
stemmed
tulip
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
three
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
funk
citrus
citrus
hop
earth
and
lemon
rine
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
lemon
rine
citrus
citrus
hop
grapefruit
funk
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
beer
really
worked
well
for
me
the
citrus
aspects
going
on
here
were
quite
well
incorporated
with
the
rest
of
the
brew
and
the
funkiness
took
it
to
the
next
level
for
me
i
wish
more
belgian
ipas
were
like
this
one
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
and
i
would
do
so
again
anytime
wow
its
fun
to
find
a
beer
that
takes
you
where
youve
never
been
not
an
everyday
drinking
beer
really
but
well
worth
a
taste
i
dont
know
what
to
say
im
pretty
blown
away
right
now
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tried
this
year
and
possibly
ever
ridiculously
complex
super
dry
just
an
amazing
beer
o
i
wasnt
much
of
a
fan
of
this
while
still
cold
first
pour
was
30
minutes
after
removing
from
the
fridge
the
first
8
oz
or
so
were
pretty
harsh
after
forgetting
about
it
for
a
while
and
letting
it
warm
up
it
gets
better
although
never
to
something
id
consider
great
at
the
price
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
skål
this
is
one
of
most
unique
beers
ive
had
even
after
having
love
buzz
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
brewery
does
next
o
interesting
not
necessarily
my
cup
of
tea
so
to
speak
but
i
can
appreciate
a
wellmade
unique
beer
bonus
point
given
here
bumping
from
4
4
5
well
carbonated
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
really
nice
i
quite
enjoy
this
brew
an
experiment
that
definitely
works
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
at
first
but
the
deeper
i
got
in
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
crafted
perfectly
very
enjoyable
a
little
pricey
but
worth
it
at
least
once
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
served
in
a
blvd
tank
7
tulip
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
couple
of
fingers
of
tight
white
head
dank
and
piney
hop
aroma
some
belgian
yeast
starts
out
with
a
bitter
bite
brett
and
barrel
hit
in
the
middle
medium
bodied
brett
really
comes
out
in
the
finish
some
citrus
oak
comes
through
as
it
warms
alcohol
is
well
hidden
im
liking
what
these
guys
are
doing
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
awesome
amazingly
complex
with
a
ton
going
on
yet
it
remains
well
balanced
without
any
one
element
dominating
with
everything
going
on
it
still
tastes
like
and
ipa
which
is
shocking
really
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
this
brewery
so
far
edit
to
add
de
dolle
edit
rarely
do
i
buy
a
new
beer
more
than
once
especially
one
that
costs
between
13
to
16
a
bottle
sure
ill
buy
six
packs
of
old
staples
anchor
sn
or
singles
of
my
favorites
pliny
but
ive
returned
to
this
beer
four
times
now
i
love
this
beer
its
awesome
im
bumping
the
scores
up
to
include
more
5s
maybe
its
splitting
hairs
or
focusing
on
things
that
dont
truly
matter
but
the
labels
claim
that
this
is
a
belgianstyle
double
ipa
is
a
little
misleading
massive
malt
infusion
reads
the
back
label
really
of
course
theres
a
lot
of
malt
but
it
still
plays
a
mere
supporting
role
there
just
isnt
enough
of
that
sweet
malty
variable
that
partly
defines
a
double
ipa
but
thats
about
all
that
wrong
with
this
thing
and
really
confining
it
to
any
style
is
futile
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
original
and
exciting
beers
to
emerge
from
the
u
s
craft
scene
in
a
while
i
enjoyed
the
heck
out
of
each
bottle
and
have
to
admit
it
was
totally
worth
the
15
99
price
tag
overall
this
is
not
as
mindblowing
as
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
but
it
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
and
unique
belgian
ipas
ive
ever
had
im
excited
to
try
anchorages
other
beers
as
the
alcohol
level
on
this
one
isnt
playing
as
well
with
the
barrelyeast
flavors
as
youd
want
one
finger
pure
white
head
mediumquick
dissipation
not
a
lot
of

medium
gold
body
got
murky
at

from

conditioning
several
streams
of
visible

hugely
complex

we
let
the
bottle
warm
fully
before
pouring
i
got
at
alternating
times
granny
smith
apples
oak
from
chardonnay
barrels
some
wine
notes
healthy
dose
of
barnyard
funk
musty
hay
from
the
brett
not
much
in
the
way
of
malt
its
really
subsumed
by
the
wood
and
brett
notes
taste
mirrors
nose
very
interesting
apple
sweetness
from
the
apollos
bretty
complexity
nice
mouthfeel
on
the
light
side
of
medium
pretty
light
for
the
style
good
effervescence
extremely
dry
finish
my
word
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
had
this
year
id
call
this
orval
on
steroids
prohibitively
expensive
to
have
on
more
than
an
infrequent
basis
but
glad
i
was
able
to
share
this
with
the
homeboys
highly
recommended
ill
be
waiting
to
try
other
beers
from
this
superlative
brewer
now
if
he
can
just
replicate
venus
yum
completely
opaque
golden
orange
with
bubbly
carb
that
left
sheets
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
pops
with
winey
white
grapes
citrusy
hops
spices
bretty
phenol
and
a
hit
of
earthy
woody
brett
a
truly
great
combo
of
aromas
complex
flavors
but
really
just
a
great
marriage
of
citrusy
hops
and
fruity
funky
brett
some
spicy
phenol
flavor
enters
towards
the
end
with
a
dry
biscuit
quality
following
kudos
to
anchorage
brewing
for
achieving
a
medium
bodied
brett
beer
with
a
nice
dry
finish
for
me
this
beer
was
love
at
first
sip
super
duper
a
nice
complex
bipa
the
brett
takes
the
show
in
this
beer
but
the
hops
help
to
provide
an
offset
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
more
cloveyphenols
from
the
yeast
wow
oak
tannin
and
hop
bitterness
galore
completely
suck
all
the
moisture
out
of
my
tongue
i
likey
big
hops
very
tropical
with
some
citrus
side
notes
again
pineapple
papaya
light
mango
with
a
bit
of
a
pink
grapefruit
twist
on
the
finish
brett
laden
through
the
middle
and
into
the
finish
yet
very
well
integrated
with
the
hops
and
barrel
aging
the
oak
flavors
are
young
and
vibrant
but
dont
overpower
the
hops
light
apple
and
pear
with
some
chardonnay
flavors
within
but
somewhat
drowned
out
by
the
ridiculous
amount
of
hops
long
finish
with
great
carbonation
a
fantastic
beer
ummm
excellent
stuff
period
from
the
aroma
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
all
funk
and
sour
but
the
hops
really
do
come
through
and
make
this
a
complex
and
unique
beer
love
it
i
bet
as
the
freshness
fades
though
the
complexity
brought
on
by
the
hop
bill
will
diminish
it
will
probably
still
be
a
decent
sour
beer
but
just
not
as
unique
and
complex
o
this
is
the
real
deal
folks
one
of
the
best
bipas
ive
ever
had
15
a
bottle
is
tough
but
here
its
worth
it
this
beer
is
an
experience
and
a
great
first
impression
from
anchorage
pours
a
hazy
glowing
peachy
light
honey
color
with
a
white
head
that
holds
and
leaves
tons
of
lace
very
pretty
nose
is
bright
fresh
fruit
up
front
mainly
pineapple
and
grapefruit
with
hints
of
pear
in
the
background
as
well
as
orange
wine
barrel
and
hops
are
intertwined
extremely
well
in
the
nose
and
taste
as
well
fruit
all
over
the
place
harmonizing
with
phenolic
yeast
spice
malt
sweetness
peeks
its
head
through
and
plays
with
the
other
flavors
that
are
coming
off
as
slightly
sweet
and
very
bright
bretty
peppery
twang
in
all
the
right
places
this
is
very
well
done
finishes
dry
and
light
warming
sensation
but
to
me
miles
from
hot
well
balanced
neobelgoindiaamerican
goodness
very
fun
hybrid
of
styles
i
like
where
this
brewery
is
going
i
love
this
brewery
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
they
do
next
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
going
forward
this
is
the
beer
i
will
think
of
when
i
think
of
belgian
ipa
even
though
its
a
double
ipa
brewed
in
alaska
o
very
nice
brew
nice
intense
hop
juice
with
some
underlying
and
calming
belgian
pal
ale
notes
very
good
brew
notes
as
with
most
funkified
ipas
the
brett
takes
over
the
beer
and
overrides
the
hoppy
characteristics
damn
ive
been
infected
with
brett
and
i
like
it
i
still
hate
sours
but
brett
beers
are
quickly
becoming
a
thing
of
beauty
to
me
this
bretted
ipa
is
blissful
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
have
this
as
the
name
implies
its
bitter
100
ibus
with
an
authentic
belgian
feel
and
not
over
carbonated
i
experienced
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
bomber
from
churchkey
33
orange
infused
golden
straw
appearance
quite
hazy
medium
offwhite
head
fairly
nice
lacing
bretty
nose
some
candyish
citrus
peel
white
wine
and
mustybarnish
hops
on
the
nose
very
bretty
and
oakish
a
bit
more
dry
and
acidic
than
your
average
iipa
hops
are
there
but
are
secondary
sweetness
is
also
there
but
minor
compared
to
the
dryness
of
it
bit
of
an
odd
duck
in
that
its
more
of
a
barrel
aged
beer
than
an
iipa
slightly
alcoholic
on
the
backside
perhaps
even
a
little
medicinal
could
stand
to
sit
for
a
bit
but
this
isnt
your
average
earlyyoung
overly
hopped
iipa
this
is
something
else
entirely
while
not
hot
the
9
isnt
helping
build
this
into
a
better
beer
body
and
mouthfeel
are
moderate
finish
is
a
little
acidic
make
that
more
than
a
little
it
was
almost
as
if
this
one
was
trying
to
do
too
much
enjoyable
but
overly
complicated
and
busy
this
was
an
expensive
bomber
from
churchkey
when
i
later
found
out
could
be
had
for
half
the
price
i
paid
at
whole
foods
nearby
o
this
is
a
complex
completely
drinkable
very
well
made
beer
dont
be
fooled
this
is
all
sour
starts
light
and
refreshing
great
mouth
the
flavor
of
hops
come
in
im
not
able
to
distinguish
which
overall
finish
bitter
earthiness
super
friends
set
a
high
mark
to
equal
for
brett
ipas
but
bitter
monk
is
another
candidate
for
the
ipa
hall
of
fame
if
you
see
this
get
it
you
will
enjoy
it
for
sure
o
good
kind
of
all
over
the
place
though
interesting
i
personally
dont
think
brett
sits
well
within
an
ipa
you
might
disagree
t
i
dunno
what
to
say
i
was
expecting
greatness
from
this
beer
and
it
more
than
delivered
cheers
to
anchorage
brewing
company
for
doing
something
completely
out
of
the
box
o
really
unique
beer
pricey
i
mean
the
beer
just
nailed
it
but
still
half
point
deduction
for
the
price
bottom
line
one
of
the
best
new
beers
ive
had
in
2011
and
instantly
makes
me
want
to
buy
more
anchorage
beer
overall
fantastic
aroma
and
a
good
flavor
the
price
tag
is
hefty
but
if
you
split
the
cost
with
someone
its
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
really
great
beer
anchorage
has
done
another
great
one
overall
good
beer
i
can
see
why
everyone
is
loving
this
i
dont
know
if
the
belgian
ipa
style
is
really
my
thing
maybe
it
is
the
brett
that
is
turning
me
off
slightly
3
55
overall
this
is
a
very
exciting
beer
and
i
would
buy
it
again
without
a
doubt
unique
beer
worth
a
shot
if
you
have
a
spare
15
bucks
or
so
great
to
share
celebrate
with
or
just
enjoy
being
challenged
with
in
your
spare
time
i
will
most
likely
be
checking
out
anchorages
other
offerings
if
i
can
find
them
this
was
a
pretty
impressive
first
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
two
finger
pillowy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
large
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
strong
brett
funk
some
lemon
zest
mango
grapefruit
and
pineapple
pretty
awesome
you
can
definitely
tell
there
is
some
citra
used
the
initial
taste
has
a
hint
of
sweetness
with
some
funky
oak
flavors
and
lemon
zest
then
the
pineapple
and
mango
come
through
the
finish
has
a
good
bitterness
with
some
brett
funk
the
finish
is
quite
dry
overall
a
really
smooth
beer
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
awesome
beer
it
was
a
bit
pricey
14
for
750ml
but
i
think
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
at
that
price
reminded
me
of
a
hopped
up
version
of
orval
o
quite
the
unique
beer
and
probably
the
only
ipa
i
have
had
that
actually
improved
with
barrel
aging
id
buy
it
again
othis
is
the
second
anchorage
beer
ive
had
now
and
its
another
winner
im
liking
what
these
guys
are
doing
o
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
the
sourness
and
complex
flavors
make
it
a
very
interesting
beer
to
sip
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
has
this
great
midpalate
arrangement
of
hops
and
yeast
character
mild
funk
some
oak
on
the
back
moderately
dry
finish
a
great
beer
overall
one
seriously
slamming
beer
from
this
brewery
what
can
i
say
they
are
making
some
dam
good
beer
up
in
alaska
all
in
all
really
a
fantastic
beer
i
quite
liked
whiteout
wit
but
this
beer
really
went
to
the
next
level
this
is
a
fantastic
belgian
ipa
i
still
cant
believe
the
contrast
between
the
nose
and
taste
but
both
deliver
in
their
own
ways
i
anticipate
good
things
from
this
brewery
while
im
curious
how
the
brett
will
treat
bitter
monk
i
would
drink
now
to
experience
the
bright
citrusgrapefruit
bitterness
very
impressiive
belgian
style
ipa
i
still
prefer
the
mischief
from
bruery
but
this
is
right
up
there
o
im
stunned
by
this
beer
it
is
truly
a
beer
to
search
for
and
an
instant
classic
for
me
i
dare
say
i
wouldnt
mind
aging
a
bottle
for
a
year
or
more
as
well
to
see
if
that
brett
changes
things
things
over
time
epic
i
loved
this
beer
a
lot
of
character
and
personality
in
every
sip
anchorage
brewing
is
doing
a
lot
of
things
right
certainly
the
most
unique
dipa
ive
tasted
flavor
is
much
more
rounded
out
than
a
typical
hop
bomb
the
hops
are
certainly
present
but
collaborate
with
all
the
flavor
brought
on
by
the
brett
and
multiple
fermentations
o
a
stunner
of
a
beer
the
second
beer
ive
had
from
anchorage
and
the
second
home
run
as
well
the
brewers
talent
seems
incredible
the
grapefruit
segment
i
described
in
the
flavor
could
be
a
happy
accident
but
that
just
seems
too
uncanny
to
be
chance
this
beer
was
designed
to
be
that
way
and
that
just
might
be
the
most
impressive
thing
about
it
i
dont
like
belgian
ipas
it
doesnt
matter
this
time
though
because
bitter
monk
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
find
me
a
valid
comparison
i
dont
believe
it
exists
4
55
o
nice
since
the
yeast
wasnt
overpowering
another
winner
for
anchorage
brewing
o
going
forward
i
dont
think
there
are
any
other
breweries
whose
releases
i
am
more
interested
in
and
excited
about
these
days
this
beer
is
incredibly
tasty
and
unlike
anything
else
ive
ever
tried
if
i
could
change
this
beer
i
would
tone
down
the
bitterness
overall
and
the
drybitter
finish
but
it
is
called
the
bitter
monk
so
it
is
what
is
says
it
is
the
abrasive
and
penetrating
bitterness
lingers
but
the
complexity
and
balance
is
admirable
if
not
amazing
unless
you
absolutely
loath
brett
belgian
yeast
or
grapefruit
rind
bitterness
it
would
be
crazy
not
to
try
this
shelton
bros
distributes
it
so
it
should
be
widely
available
pours
a
nice
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
cloud
of
white
head
smell
was
that
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
citrus
taste
was
a
full
on
hoppy
blast
mixed
with
grass
and
citrus
and
some
what
floral
overall
a
great
ipa
a
different
ipa
experience
the
taste
and
color
of
a
great
ipa
lots
of
bottle
variability
on
this
one
ive
had
a
few
gushers
with
corks
hitting
the
ceiling
and
two
totally
flat
nearly
undrinkable
bottles
this
beer
is
good
but
i
would
avoid
aging
or
buying
old
bottles
o
intriguing
for
sure
when
id
had
enough
citrus
i
could
focus
on
the
funk
kept
my
attention
the
whole
bomber
through
although
by
the
end
the
lemon
did
start
wearing
on
me
i
could
have
appreciated
a
wider
variety
of
hop
flavors
my
bottle
was
about
a
year
and
half
old
i
wonder
how
long
it
should
be
kept
so
that
the
funk
becomes
the
main
component
bright
golden
color
foamy
and
cloudy
citrahop
sour
coriander
very
crisp
and
light
great
white
ipa
overall
this
isnt
that
impressive
of
a
beer
especially
from
anchorage
brewing
they
put
too
much
time
into
trying
to
re
create
the
ipa
and
failed
miserably
this
is
a
completely
unbalanced
beer
and
has
funky
bitterness
from
places
that
shouldnt
contribute
to
the
taste
of
a
great
ipa
i
can
only
hope
that
bitter
monk
is
their
answer
to
this
delicious
smooth
drinkable
white
ipa
the
kumquat
add
a
odd
but
enjoyable
sweetness
very
good
a
must
try
o
a
damn
tasty
brett
ipa
i
kind
of
wish
this
came
out
in
the
summer
since
it
would
taste
even
better
under
the
hot
sun
all
the
ingredients
in
this
beer
work
harmoniously
to
create
a
unified
flavor
profile
light
lacey
quickly
fading
head
good
lacing
pale
yellow
in
color
not
a
lot
of
smell
to
it
flavor
was
a
bit
off
to
me
at
first
half
way
through
the
first
glass
the
hops
kumquats
and
peppercorns
became
very
detectable
very
tasty
after
getting
used
to
it
id
buy
it
again
maybe
age
it
careful
when
opening
almost
killed
me
md
this
is
a
highly
carbonated
beer
as
noted
before
and
scrubs
the
palate
very
much
so
its
a
decent
balance
between
bitter
and
citrus
that
while
i
find
thin
bodied
is
very
refreshing
and
im
finding
it
very
easy
to
get
through
this
750ml
bottle
quickly
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
but
will
sneak
up
on
a
person
im
guessing
im
pleasantly
surprised
that
i
am
enjoying
this
as
much
as
i
am
as
im
not
a
huge
ipa
guy
but
the
melding
of
styles
works
beautifully
i
recommend
this
one
and
would
have
no
issues
picking
this
up
again
probably
the
best
white
ipa
ive
ever
had
although
i
would
have
just
identified
it
as
an
american
ipa
with
brett
overall

this
beer
is
a
bit
all
over
the
place
but
in
a
thoroughly
entertaining
way
the
appearance
is
excellent
but
a
little
nonstandard
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
funky
and
slightly
offkilter
but
bright
and
aromatic
at
the
same
time
the
flavor
is
very
complex
with
some
unexpected
characters
but
wellcrafted
and
the
feel
is
as
close
to
perfect
as
anything
could
be
especially
how
well
it
complements
the
flavor
some
things
dont
mesh
at
all
times
and
ive
never
been
big
on
the
garlicky
hop
notes
but
it
still
works
this
is
just
a
very
complex
deeply
interesting
brett
beer
and
i
like
it
still
like
bitter
monk
better
though
a
very
complex
brew
the
bottle
is
from
april
and
still
hoppy
but
i
would
like
to
age
a
bottle
and
see
how
the
beer
evolves
and
if
there
is
a
sense
of
the
brett
that
i
did
not
get
this
time
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
refreshing
balanced
and
funky
with
still
an
earthy
hop
quality
tropical
goodness
with
spicy
overtones
do
you
crave
wits
to
be
on
the
hoppy
side
i
know
i
do
this
brew
is
recommended
750
ml
corked
bottle
poured
in
a
chalice
the
bottle
has
two
intro
paragraphs
describing
various
frontiers
of
human
achievement
plus
some
information
about
the
white
ipa
in
the
bottle
quite
amusing
the
beer
pours
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
first
smell
that
hit
my
nose
was
grapefruit
then
a
bit
of
tangerine
a
lot
of
citrus
and
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
like
a
fruit
salad
at
first
transitioning
to
a
bitter
hop
flavor
once
it
reaches
the
back
of
your
palette
the
finish
is
a
bit
of
oak
and
herbs
and
the
spices
are
noticeable
overall
excellent

im

that
this
beer
is
as
hoppy
as
it
is
from
april
love
galaxy
love
brett
love
anchorage
a
bit
of
a
confused
beer
funky
at
times
bitter
at
others
and
always
very
pale
overall
i
quite
enjoy
it
but
its
not
quite
enough
of
one
thing
or
another
to
excite
me
o
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
this
or
any
anchorage
beer
in
delaware
hoppy
belgian
beers
are
typically
among
my
favorites
so
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
i
couldnt
have
asked
for
more
in
the
aroma
it
is
a
complexity
of
brett
citrus
hops
and
spices
the
flavors
followed
suit
but
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
there
are
no
flavors
out
of
place
but
the
flavor
came
off
a
bit
diluted
the
more
i
drank
a
great
beer
but
i
was
looking
for
something
with
more
flavor
still
among
the
best
int
he
style
i
have
ever
had
well
done
but
i
wont
be
running
back
to
the
store
to
get
another
11
bomber
bitter
monk
and
darkest
hour
are
more
stupefying
offerings
from
anchorage
brewing
co
and
encourage
all
who
read
this
to
investigate
these
brands
this
one
drinks
like
a
mix
between
a
belgian
ipa
and
a
saison
i
like
what
its
trying
to
do
but
i
dont
think
it
was
successful
im
also
not
sure
time
was
kind
to
this
there
are
a
fair
amount
of
hops
but
the
hop
flavors
are
not
fresh
the
brett
is
very
developed
and
the
additives
make
for
an
interesting
and
very
fruity
experience
but
it
just
doesnt
come
together
for
me
add
in
some
off
flavors
and
i
will
pass
next
time
o
this
beers
struts
some
impressive
plumage
but
ultimately
falls
flat
i
may
have
to
get
used
to
this
style
and
then
give
it
another
try
overall
this
is
an
acquired
taste
that
i
have
learned
to
appreciate
over
the
past
year
or
so
this
particular
brew
has
more
balance
that
other
brett
bombs
i
have
had
tasty
and
refreshing
relies
less
on
fruit
than
nonbrett
whites
however
both
have
their
respective
places
this
is
the
brett
counterpart
to
allagash
white
thin
bone
white
head
mostly
loose
and
bubbles
off
swiftly
very
bright
and
seems
to
reflect
light
nicely
the
lacing
is
the
sort
which
initially
forms
a
very
thin
yet
broad
sheet
but
has
little
stick
and
as
a
whole
it
just
glides
down
the
glass
sides
cloudy
yet
bright
canary
yellow
colored
liquid
very
difficult
to
see
any
bubbles
inside
the
glass
warm
luminescence
to
it
the
nose
most
prominently
hits
you
with
tart
white
grapefruit
notes
lots
of
salty
accents
and
burnt
dark
bread
crusts
more
finished
bread
than
yeasts
quite
grassy
theres
something
like
an
herb
infused
olive
oil
thing
going
on
too
maybe
pineapple
or
nectarine
but
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
call
the
scents
fruity
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
swells
immediately
through
the
attack
which
gives
it
a
creamier
mouth
feel
needed
for
when
that
lemon
and
white
grapefruit
citrus
slash
on
through
pepper
and
salt
green
grass
clove
and
coriander
all
contribute
to
a
bright
tangy
experience
here
the
peach
apricot
nectarine
and
persimmon
fruit
is
sweeter
and
more
longlasting
there
is
a
certain
vinous
quality
not
sure
id
call
it
out
and
out
bretty
likewise
the
yeasts
are
tame
and
not
particularly
softening
fresh
finish
given
the
elements
it
throws
at
you
remains
very
good
on
the
drinkability
scale
do
an
excellent
brett
beer
this
belgianstyle
strong
pale
ale
struggles
to
live
up
to
the
ipa
label
instead
it
delivers
an
austere
dose
of
wild
yeast
funk
with
little
associated
tartness
if
theres
another
belgian
ipa
thats
better
someone
please
hip
me
to
it
this
is
fantastic
although
i
couldnt
possibly
justify
the
16
99
price
tag
as
a
regular
in
the
rotation
and
thats
a
shame
i
will
however
be
grabbing
at
least
a
few
more
of
these
to
cellar
for
the
long
haul
the
next
time
i
see
it
overall
good
to
really
good
beer
doesnt
do
anything
amazing
but
is
impressive
in
its
delicacy
definitely
worth
a
try
but
try
to
find
it
on
tap
im
on
the
fence
whether
its
worth
the
bottle
price
i
split
a
bottle
of
this
with
a
friend
tonight
11714
it
was
from
batch
5
july13
absolutely
delicious
this
brewery
has
yet
to
do
anything
but
bow
my
mind
my
only
regret
is
that
i
dont
live
close
enough
to
frequent
the
brewery
at
least
there
is
another
bottle
in
the
fridge
i
can
drink
tomorrow
a
very
nice
belgianwhite
ipa
bitter
with
spices
in
the
right
places
ill
be
giving
anchorage
my
patronage
in
the
future
this
starts
off
interesting
and
actually
gets
more
interesting
as
you
make
your
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
use
of
brett
is
quite
lovely
and
the
hops
have
held
up
even
through
this
is
months
old
at
this
point
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
anchorage
and
its
far
from
a
disappointment
two
finger
bright
white
head
with
excellent
lacing
on
a
cloudy
pale
golden
body
aroma
is
strong
and
full
with
coriander
dominating
and
notes
of
yeast
pale
malts
herbal
hops
lemon
zest
and
peppercorn
citrus
aroma
from
white
pineapple
and
tangerine
flavor
reminds
of
saison
with
a
lot
of
yeast
and
coriander
throughout
lemongrass
herbal
notes
white
pepper
tropical
citrus
clove
and
chardonnay
wine
medium
body
semi
dry
finish
and
moderate
carbonation
complex
unique
and
memorable
galaxy
hops
paired
well
with
this
combination
which
has
a
lot
going
on
but
the
drinker
isnt
overwhelmed
o
my
first
from
this
brewery
and
i
look
forward
for
many
more
to
come
happy
to
see
they
have
finally
got
distribution
in
mo
balanced
complex
cracked
pepper
crispness
and
journey
of
bold
flavors
that
seem
to
explore
something
new
with
every
sip
an
easy
drinking
and
tasty
belgian
ipa
from
anchorage
its
so
good
to
have
them
return
to
st
louis
overall
very
impressive
beer
very
original
mixture
of
ingredients
bold
and
intelligently
crafted
ill
be
aging
some
of
them
the
brewers
say
the
brettanomyces
come
out
a
lot
more
given
time
im
curious
to
see
what
itll
be
like
ill
probably
send
out
another
review
for
an
aged
bottle
the
problem
with
beers
like
this
incredibly
hoppy
citrusy
but
bone
dry
is
that
much
of
the
juicy
citrus
character
is
lost
in
the
flavor
due
to
the
dryness
this
beer
is
a
testament
to
the
wonders
of
indian
coriander
it
doesnt
have
that
dirty
herbal
character
that
western
coriander
does
and
it
really
integrates
very
nicely
with
the
kumquat
and
galaxy
hops
interestingly
enough
i
hadnt
realized
that
coriander
and
kumquats
were
used
here
i
wholly
attributed
their
flavor
contributions
to
the
hops
but
now
having
read
the
label
they
most
definitely
contribute
the
pepper
to
adds
a
nice
spiciness
to
this
brew
that
was
again
mistaken
for
hop
character
back
to
the
problem
without
the
residual
malt
sweetness
that
even
supports
the
driest
of
the
usual
ipas
this
beer
has
lost
the
juicy
citrus
character
that
would
be
otherwise
be
noticeable
in
the
flavor
while
i
have
compared
this
a
lot
to
an
ipa
it
is
clearly
not
one
given
the
interpretive
take
the
style
can
have
i
would
say
this
fits
into
the
saison
category
at
least
better
than
it
fits
anywhere
else
since
i
do
love
hoppy
and
i
do
love
saisons
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
exceedingly
enjoyable
and
i
doubt
i
will
be
able
to
hold
on
to
my
second
bottle
long
enough
to
allow
the
brettanomyces
presence
to
increase
much
lots
and
lots
going
on
flavor
wise
but
it
all
comes
together
pretty
nicely
for
me
i
like
the
way
the
brett
spices
and
big
fruity
flavors
work
with
each
other
overall
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
the
white
ipa
is
style
i
dont
usually
care
for
but
i
like
the
belgian
brett
twist

taste
experience
wood
aged
galaxy
hops
spices
brett
still
i
give
them
props
for
trying
this
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
story
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
and
the
idea
of
it
that
they
executed
seriously
though
read
the
back
of
the
bottle
if
you
have
the
opportunity
because
it
is
especially
inspiring
that
aside
the
most
enjoyable
quality
of
the
beer
itself
was
its
taste
the
nose
starts
off
nicely
giving
bright
florals
and
grain
against
the
included
advertised
ingredients
the
bretty
remains
ever
pervasive
but
really
begins
to
pop
in
the
flavoring
even
as
the
aroma
fades
into
booziness
with
warmth
the
taste
again
shows
all
of
what
you
would
expect
with
bitterness
from
the
whole
peppercorns
and
citric
kumquat
inclusions
alike
the
oak
coriander
spiciness
and
brett
also
blend
through
the
finish
giving
a
final
picture
of
cohesion
and
fullness
this
is
reflected
in
the
creamy
feel
which
helps
keep
the
aforementioned
robustness
in
check
while
certainly
made
headway
on
the
trail
with
this
one
with
the
wildness
of
the
yeast
and
the
unconventional
fruit
and
spice
hopefully
those
to
follow
with
further
mold
and
refine
what
anchorage
classifies
as
their
white
ipa
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
spritzy
and
dry
i
wanna
make
a
men
in
black
reference
but
after
witnessing
the
horror
of
the
third
film
im
not
even
gonna
bother
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
auburnbrass
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
funky
brett
grapefruit
rind
mild
grass
and
a
touch
of
lime
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
brett
hamming
it
up
on
stage
and
some
lemon
and
lime
trying
their
best
to
blend
into
the
background
some
minor
notes
of
earth
and
wood
need
we
build
a
log
cabin
in
louisiana
sneak
in
there
as
well
but
arent
able
to
cause
much
of
a
ruckus
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
dry
finish
overall
this
seems
like
a
godsend
for
any
lovers
of
brett
andor
hops
for
me
i
felt
the
brett
overdid
it
a
bit
but
not
by
too
much
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
brett
done
right
with
the
added
bonus
of
really
refreshing
hop
components
solid
on
all
accounts
id
love
to
drink
more
of
this
in
the
future
o
this
is
different
complex
and
while
i
dont
love
it
i
definitely
like
it
if
you
dont
tolerate
brett
well
you
may
not
want
to
pick
this
up
if
you
dont
mind
it
its
definitely
worth
trying
o
well
this
was
my
first
white
ipa
although
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
brett
saison
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
very
complex
and
even
more
so
as
it
warms
they
took
a
risk
doing
as
much
with
the
beer
as
they
did
but
damn
if
it
didnt
pay
off
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
at
some
point
to
compare
experiences
caged
and
corked
750ml
bottle
pours
with
a
pale
yet
bright
gold
body
with
faint
haze
supporting
a
tall
densely
cobwebed
white
head
of
foam
the
aroma
offers
up
lime
tangerine
grapefruit
and
a
sour
lime
sort
of
wild
yeastiness
the
taste
has
a
very
effervescent
quality
and
it
is
so
much
so
it
is
tough
to
sink
you
teeth
into
the
experience
im
getting
fruity
and
tart
grapefruit
notes
that
are
sliding
into
lime
like
citrus
and
some
citrusy
tartness
pretty
nice
but
the
huge
carbonation
detracts
from
the
experience
o
i
read
the
bottle
and
it
sounded
great
i
poured
the
bottle
and
it
looked
great
i
tasted
the
beer
and
it
was
pretty
darn
good
i
really
like
everything
about
this
beer
except
that
i
only
purchased
one
bottle
o
im
not
one
to
think
too
highly
of
beers
that
push
the
edge
but
this
one
is
pretty
interesting
and
it
just
keeps
getting
better
and
better
as
i
linger
over
it
i
dont
think
that
its
completely
together
but
its
pretty
darn
good
ill
definitely
look
and
buy
another
bottle
o
a
complex
strange
beer
but
so
thoroughly
enjoyable
brought
back
from
maine
750
ml
cork
and
cage
slight
misfiring
cork
grazed
the
side
of
my
head
before
ending
up
across
the
room
pours
out
half
foam
atop
a
cloudy
light
straw
liquid
lots
of
lace
and
mad
retention
the
aroma
is
certainly
tart
and
a
bit
funky
saison
like
aroma
with
lots
of
spice
a
bit
of
tart
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
with
some
hops
still
evident
and
a
vinous
character
deep
underneath
the
flavor
is
more
funk
than
tart
with
bits
of
citrus
evident
as
well
as
some
light
wine
notes
medium
to
light
body
with
a
huge
level
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
crisp
funky
mouthfeel
nice
beer
but
not
much
of
an
ipa
after
a
years
aging
i
enjoyed
this
aside
from
the
cork
headache
mouthfeeloverall
mouthfeel
is
light
with
ample
carbonation
very
good
for
the
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
belgian
ipa
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
was
very
well
done
the
prominent
funk
aside
lots
of
great
tropical
fruit
scents
and
flavors
make
this
beer
a
good
one
to
try
finishes
very
dry
and
leave
some
slightly
tart
notes
on
the
tongue
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
and
i
was
not
disappointed
a
little
overwhelming
and
kind
of
clashing
flavors
but
decent
first
alaska
rate
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
a
massive
light
fluffy
head
that
explodes
up
the
glass
aroma
is
big
lemon
peel
oak
funky
brett
some
light
spices
and
hints
of
earthy
hops
more
of
a
farmhouse
ale
than
an
ipa
on
the
nose
light
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
maybe
too
much
flavor
is
dusty
bitter
up
front
followed
by
a
bit
of
pine
hop
and
then
finishes
with
some
sweet
lemon
and
pineapple
sour
kumquattyness
very
very
dry
to
the
point
that
i
need
a
drink
of
water
afterward
the
up
front
bitter
is
unpleasant
and
seems
a
bit
off
for
my
liking
i
could
definitely
see
this
as
a
summer
beer
and
it
drinks
extremely
light
for
7
5
but
overall
i
am
much
less
impressed
with
this
than
others
the
appearance
and
huge
carbonation
hurt
the
final
rating
but
it
seems
to
have
hit
what
they
were
going
for
overall
i
came
into
this
beer
pretty
excited
i
dig
hops
brett
and
witbier
this
one
just
didnt
come
together
well
the
barrel
is
hidden
by
the
bold
hopping
as
is
the
wit
yeasts
and
spices
the
brett
comes
through
as
does
the
kumquat
but
none
of
these
flavors
are
in
harmony
and
treat
the
pallate
more
like
a
battlefield
than
anything
else
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
be
goiing
back
for
more
nearly
a
year
past
bottling
date
its
taken
on
a
distinctly
saisonesque
flavor
profile
with
the
pepper
and
brett
really
doing
a
number
on
things
here
theres
also
a
solid
hop
presence
still
lingering
providing
a
fruitiness
and
a
nice
background
bitterness
its
an
extremely
dry
beer
with
the
brett
and
hops
contributing
strongly
to
that
so
much
going
on
here
that
its
really
not
worth
picking
apart
in
the
review
each
sip
reveals
new
facets
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
highly
carbonated
and
as
before
mentioned
very
dry
overall
anchorages
galaxy
white
ipa
has
held
up
very
well
a
year
past
bottling
its
very
interesting
extremely
complex
and
very
tasty
d
id
like
to
try
this
again
fresh
to
see
how
intense
the
galaxy
hops
are
but
even
with
age
this
is
a
really
nice
mix
of
hops
brett
and
adjuncts
nice
to
see
that
these
anchorage
beers
hold
up
over
time
too
very
enjoyable
but
i
expect
nothing
else
from
gabe
o
why
you
would
call
this
an
ipa
i
dont
know
but
its
an
interesting
complex
beer
to
sip
on
the
porch
when
the
weather
changes
an
excellent
brew
o
with
the
bit
of
age
this
bottle
had
on
it
i
suspect
that
the
brett
character
has
gotten
more
pronounced
this
was
quite
enjoyable
although
it
isnt
drinking
too
much
like
an
ipa
at
this
point
two
beers
from
anchorage
and
two
big
winners
in
my
book
im
not
digging
on
peppercorns
in
my
beer
andor
this
seemed
to
have
a
pretty
heavy
dose
of
such
smells
lighter
than
it
tastes
if
you
find
yourself
loving
this
try
poivre
noir
from
pipeworks
wish
this
was
more
refreshingbummer
this
is
a
really
nice
very
complex
highly
drinkable
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
this
beer
is
truly
impressive
each
sip
revealed
a
new
flavor
this
beer
was
so
intricate
that
i
know
this
review
wont
do
it
justice
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
nope
ill
have
to
find
someone
to
trade
for
the
other
bottle
not
interested
in
seeing
how
much
funkier
this
can
get
over
time
o
a
nice
balance
of
brett
galaxy
and
the
additional
citrus
fruit
a
bit
too
crisp
for
me
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
a
really
unique
beer
in
my
opinion
and
probably
the
first
ipa
ive
had
that
might
actually
age
nicely
due
to
the
brettanomyces
and
wine
yeast
itd
probably
develop
into
something
completely
different
than
what
ive
had
today
but
it
would
be
an
interesting
experiment
momma
lucia
im
diggin
it
a
very
interesting
beer
more
of
a
saison
than
an
ipa
and
with
a
hefty
18
dollar
price
tag
no
where
near
worth
it
of
course
i
am
drinking
this
on
the
east
coast
and
it
may
have
lost
an
edge
in
transit
the
brett
is
drying
the
beer
out
and
over
carbing
it
in
the
process
i
would
say
drink
it
if
you
got
it
or
youll
be
chasing
the
cork
and
foam
all
over
the
kitchen
oreally
enjoyed
this
white
ipa
the
flavors
were
good
and
wellbalanced
an
easy
drinking
wipa
with
a
good
depth
of
flavor
the
only
drawback
is
the
attenuation
overall
a
quality
beer
i
must
be
honest
that
i
expected
to
be
more
blown
away
but
it
seems
like
white
ipas
tend
to
peak
sooner
than
12
months
after
bottling
i
have
another
bottle
so
i
may
have
to
see
if
extensive
aging
allows
the
brett
to
turn
this
into
a
completely
different
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
entire
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruit
yeast
wine
and
brett
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
wine
and
brett
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
smells
better
in
my
opinion
o
a
very
refreshing
beer
great
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
light
body
and
highly
carbonation
bubbles
gently
sweeping
across
your
tongue
and
wiping
it
clean
very
refreshing
and
the
flavors
would
go
well
complementing
some
food
o
interesting
and
complex
flavour
profile
i
have
a
feeling
this
beer
will
be
like
orval
where
it
will
be
very
different
and
much
more
sour
with
some
age
on
it
actually
this
seems
more
like
a
belgian
beer
than
a
north
american
either
way
this
beer
is
fantastic
one
of
the
more
interesting
and
delicious
beers
ive
had
in
some
time
very
very
impressed
with
my
first
beer
from
anchorage
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
creamy
looking
with
one
of
the
most
prominent
airy
long
lasting
bone
white
heads
ive
ever
seen
rising
well
above
the
rim
of
my
globe
fluffy
the
nose
is
crazy
lots
of
bitter
hops
quite
a
bit
of
citrus
too
from
the
kumquats
and
of
course
the
brett
which
is
subtle
but
definitely
a
contributor
the
flavor
is
super
complex
but
perfectly
balanced
i
would
leave
the
coriander
out
as
i
think
it
doesnt
add
a
ton
to
the
flavor
that
couldnt
be
there
otherwise
but
it
does
sort
of
crowd
a
some
stuff
out
wheat
malt
first
with
the
belgian
witbier
yeast
and
some
lemon
pepper
stuff
which
i
guess
is
aided
by
the
peppercorn
addition
works
well
with
the
yeast
anyway
it
gives
way
to
a
fruity
hop
bitterness
thats
really
intense
and
there
is
some
acid
from
the
wine
barrels
that
exacerbates
this
there
is
a
ton
going
on
here
and
the
bretty
bitter
finish
is
unique
and
memorable
white
ipa
with
galaxy
hops
coriander
kumquat
peppercorns
wit
yeast
then
aged
in
wine
casks
dry
hopped
with
galaxy
and
conditioned
with
brett
its
insane
and
it
works
light
airy
feel
from
the
carbonation
it
seems
almost
too
light
to
handle
all
the
flavor
but
it
does
somehow
a
really
phenomenal
beer
that
im
sure
a
quantum
physicist
is
behind
its
just
so
advanced
well
impressive
the
interplay
and
balance
between
the
ipa
and
yeast
characteristics
is
a
thing
to
behold
the
number
of
discriptors
on
this
bottle
is
ridiculous
the
cork
hit
the
ceiling
as
it
popped
off
the
beer
pours
a
straw
gold
with
a
fluffy
head
that
eventually
fades
brett
is
apparent
in
the
aroma
with
some
tropical
fruitiness
from
the
hops
or
maybe
the
cumquots
i
have
no
idea
the
flavor
is
dry
with
plenty
of
funky
brett
earthy
hops
and
some
nice
corriander
and
spice
the
finish
is
bitter
and
dry
with
hits
of
oak
the
bitterness
lingers
nicely
pricey
at
12
but
delicious
none
the
less
liked
it
where
i
couldve
loved
it
o
a
gold
standard
for
this
new
style
bottle
poured
a
hazy
whiteyellow
color
ale
with
a
super
large
pale
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
dry
hoppy
notes
with
some
strong
brett
notes
also
dominating
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
solid
wheat
alt
notes
with
some
strong
fruity
and
dry
hops
notes
with
a
finish
dominated
by
the
funky
brett
notes
body
is
full
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
really
well
put
together
with
huge
amount
of
complexity
while
retaining
a
great
level
of
drinkability
a
very
unique
beer
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
the
aging
in
oak
wine
tanks
has
done
but
there
is
a
greater
complexity
present
that
i
have
difficult
picking
out
the
individual
favors
that
may
be
due
to
the
aging
very
enjoyable
yep
brought
a
taste
to
a
distinguished
beer
taster
and
she
said
bitter
and
gave
me
the
puckering
uh
whats
this
expression
not
pretty
still
i
appreciate
this
am
amazed
i
guessed
kumquats
find
it
bold
and
tasty
especially
after
some
opening
up
but
unnecessarily
complex
busy
bitter
and
weird
o
a
bit
too
bitterresinous
good
fruit
character
overall
may
have
been
better
a
couple
months
ago
but
still
solid
not
especially
witlike
but
good
overall
a
tasty
beer
a
belgian
style
wheat
beer
not
so
much
of
an
ipa
the
taste
is
tangy
and
fruity
as
the
aroma
indicated
with
kumquat
quality
standing
out
with
sweet
and
bitter
citrus
with
peppery
element
from
the
hops
and
mild
yeast
with
wheat
sweetness
and
grapefruity
bitterness
with
acidic
finish
overall
a
top
notch
drinkability
for
the
style
with
very
good
blend
of
flavors
overall
complex
and
very
unique
in
terms
of
flavor
profile
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
although
i
am
quite
the
lover
of
all
things
hoppy
and
all
things
brett
there
are
many
different
parts
of
the
brewing
process
that
played
major
roles
in
the
final
product
frequently
this
would
lead
to
a
beer
with
muddled
flavors
but
not
this
one
incredible
balance
cant
wait
till
my
next
trip
to
alaska
great
fishing
and
now
great
belgianstyle
ales
d
very
tasty
stuff
glad
the
brett
characteristics
are
as
prevalent
as
i
was
hoping
they
would
be
also
i
would
like
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
most
appealing
looking
bipas
i
have
seen
ever
kudos
to
anchorage
for
doing
a
stellar
job
with
the
bottle
conditioning
here
overall
slow
sipping
beer
and
a
bit
too
crisp
here
well
balanced
flavors
and
the
oak
and
brett
make
this
very
interesting
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
was
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
generous
white
head
a
high
level
of
carbonation
made
this
one
want
to
jump
out
of
the
bottle
i
will
forgive
the
minor
inconvenience
the
aroma
was
very
discreet
with
floral
notes
and
some
belgian
accents
in
the
initial
taste
i
thought
i
was
drinking
soapy
water
the
citrus
notes
that
come
with
the
brett
combine
with
the
floral
notes
to
make
me
wonder
if
the
glass
was
properly
cleaned
the
backbone
of
hops
is
mild
even
for
a
belgian
ipa
the
mouthfeel
was
aggressively
bubbly
like
drinking
a
warm
can
of
sprite
the
carbonation
mercifully
subtracted
the
soapy
taste
from
my
mouth
i
can
not
endorse
this
beer
pours
a
straw
almost
white
yellow
color
with
a
big
three
finger
head
despite
a
pretty
easy
pour
thre
are
big
lines
of
lace
all
over
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
breadiness
lemon
zest
and
floral
and
earthy
hops
the
aroma
is
deep
and
full
the
taste
is
unique
there
is
a
lemonzest
and
corriander
taste
up
front
along
with
brett
the
middle
waters
out
a
little
and
you
get
belgian
yeast
and
some
funk
the
back
end
is
all
hops
it
is
a
floral
earthy
hop
at
the
back
end
not
overly
bitter
but
it
balances
out
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
in
fact
when
i
uncorked
the
bottle
i
almost
killed
three
people
mouthfeel
is
stingy
and
bubbly
overall
it
is
a
decent
belgian
ipa
it
starts
out
strong
but
starts
to
fizzle
a
little
at
the
end
atmosphere
is
pretty
impressive
interesting
hue
great
primary
head
which
settles
to
a
nice
secondary
head
pretty
solid
lacing
too
nose
is
a
sourdough
bready
tone
with
plenty
spice
floral
and
some
sweet
components
very
wellbalanced
flavor
is
a
buttery
feeling
combination
of
fresh
flora
with
pine
and
savory
spice
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
subtle
all
the
way
around
except
for
the
steely
biting
finish
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
cage
on
top
of
the
cork
the
cork
blew
straight
off
without
even
touching
it
and
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
hue
basically
looks
like
urine
and
has
a
fluffy
three
finger
rising
head
and
similar
lacingthe
smell
is
flowers
in
bloomorangesherbacous
hops
and

mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
yet
creamy
and
has
tastes
of
kumquatscitruscorrianderthe
slightest
touch
of
spice
and
funkpineapple
and
finished
with
a
light
zesty
herbal
hoppy
bitterness
and
overall
i
like
it
and
its
definately
something
id
buy
again
just
like
the
rest
of
their
range
you
have
to
try
it
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
bitting
witch
make
it
a
bit
hard
to
quaff
but
needless
to
say
its
really
enjoyable
o
this
is
good
for
its
style
but
since
im
still
not
much
of
a
fan
of
the
lighter
belgian
styles
just
ok
to
me
ill
keep
looking
for
lighter
belgians
to
try
and
maybe
ill
find
my
niche
in
one
of
these
things
some
day
o
whats
not
to
love
when
you
have
brett
and
the
zing
of
galaxy
hops
this
white
ipa
is
out
of
this
world
and
delivers
its
name
claim
super
complex
yet
well
blended
nothing
over
dominates
but
all
layers
work
together
in
one
harmonious
universe
of
flavor
one
complex
beast
of
a
belgianstyle
ipa
with
the
overall
effect
wellskewed
to
the
former
the
fruit
yeast
and
funk
generally
subsuming
the
hops
in
their
tidy
little
cabal
maybe
its
the
galaxy
hops
which
i
have
yet
to
find
worthy
of
providing
a
big
ipa
experience
but
here
theyre
probably
an
unfair
patsy
as
there
is
just
so
much
else
going
on
in
a
crazily
somehow
balanced
manner
a
rather
enjoyable
tipple
and
worthy
of
its
entry
into
my
little
boardwalk
empireenhanced
volstead
act
flight
of
fancy
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
extremely
complex
and
delicious
looking
forward
to
trying
their
love
buzz
saison
soon
if
you
like
brett
you
will
like
this
overall
a
unique
belgian
ipa
from
anchorage
that
pushes
the
envelope
with
some
adventurous
fruit
flavours
peach
for
example
the
flavours
mingle
well
making
this
an
easytodrink
belgian
ipa
killer
beer
a
friend
of
mine
tried
it
when
it
was
fresh
and
said
it
was
an
average
ipa
with
some
off
flavors
i
had
a
bottle
last
night
that
was
bottled
in
january
2012
and
it
was
amazing
definitely
let
this
beer
age
in
the
bottle
for
at
least
6
months
the
brett
does
its
thing
and
the
beer
has
amazing
lemon
and
sour
notes
but
the
galaxy
still
comes
through
an
effervescent
and
enjoyable
beer
o
a
great
take
on
a
white
ipa
the
brett
adds
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
while
still
keeping
the
balance
in
check
stellar
execution
o
i
wrote
in
my
notes
not
fresh
i
couldnt
figure
out
when
it
was
bottled
at
the
time
of
my
notetaking
but
i
was
informed
later
that
it
was
over
3
months
old
at
that
point
still
having
purchased
it
from
a
refrigerated
store
and
also
having
spent
about
15
on
it
i
had
a
reasonable
expectation
that
this
would
be
better
than
it
was
as
a
side
note
dont
aim
the
cork
at
anyone
you
could
probably
take
someones
head
off
poured
from
the
corked
and
caged
bottle
into
a
snifter
body
is
a
pale
hazy
goldenwhite
color
topped
by
a
huge
egg
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
thin
coating

of
mild
wheat
citrus
and
sharply
floral
spicesprimarily
coriander
palate
is
a
complex
blend
of
citrus
peel
dry

a
melange
of

finish
is
very
zesty
and
sharply
astringent
body
is
lively
and
light
with
a
tangy
dry
finish
this
is
a
thoroughly
interesting
beer
that
has
held
up
well
after
a
few
months
of
aging
notes
nice
flow
same
issues
as
before
with
the
pricing
but
the
quality
is
memorable
really
enjoying
these
brews
owould
love
to
age
this
bottle
but
away
from
home
extremely
unique
drinking
experience
recommend
fresh
to
enjoy
the
hops
on
a
farmhouse
ale
or
age
to
enhance
the
funky
yeast
overall
another
fine
beer
from
a
fine
brewery
overall
a
strong
entry
in
the
field
o
very
well
done
anchorage
is
fastly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
overall
another
really
great
creative
beer
from
anchorage
o
this
one
is
tough
to
decipher
in
some
ways
its
unfocussed
and
busy
but
i
think
most
of
the
flavours
do
jive
well
enough
to
create
a
unique
brew
within
this
burgeoning
style
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
you
have
to
try
it
to
make
that
call
taste
chalky
bretty
spice
coriander
mild
citrus
notes
lacked
the
hops
and
bitterness
of
bitter
monk
this
was
more
like
a
wit
straight
up
it
also
lacked
the
tartnesssourness
and
acidity
that
i
was
hoping
for
if
i
was
in
charge
this
would
have
more
hop
character
and
less
belgian
wit
character
alcohol
seemed
higher
than
their
other
beers
that
are
actually
higher
in
alcohol
content
a
little
bit
of
grassyness
to
it
as
well
i
dunno
i
think
they
should
drop
the
ipa
reference
on
the
label
a
decent
beer
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
bitter
monk
for
many
reasons
o
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
its
great
to
see
a
beer
that
is
100
barrel
fermented
and
then
finished
with
brett
tough
to
find
and
worth
the
wait
oa
nice
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
the
slight
tartness
however
more
bitterness
and
hop
flavors
would
have
made
this
beer
better
o
overall
sour
lemony
hops
drinks
like
a
cross
between
a
saison
and
wit
a
lot
of
breweries
hold
back
on
the
brett
this
one
is
very
well
pronounced
and
goes
balls
to
the
wall
slow
methodical
drinker
offers
a
varying
degree
of
complexity
and
a
good
dose
of
brett
interesting
lots
of

easy
drinking
no

top
two
thirds
of
the
glass
head
retention
is
very
good
but
lacing
is
a
bit
on
the
spotty
side
eight
to
nine
months
after
bottling
its
hard
to
rate
this
as
a
belgian
ipa
as
its
more
of
a
wild
ale
at
this
point
the
nose
has
a
good
bit
of
barnyard
funk
to
it
as
well
as
a
citric
tartness
to
it
theres
also
the
last
remnants
of
some
more
tropical
fruit
aromas
from
the
fading
galaxy
hops
again
with
the
flavor
profile
theres
a
strong
funky
brett
presence
i
dont
know
what
kumquats
taste
like
but
given
that
theyre
related
to
oranges
im
attributing
to
them
the
citrus
bent
that
the
light
tartness
here
has
just
as
with
the
nose
the
fruity
hop
flavor
is
a
shell
of
what
it
must
have
been
soon
after
bottling
the
body
is
wonderfully
dry
and
the
carbonation
is
very
lively
it
could
stand
to
be
just
a
little
bit
more
so
but
its
still
very
close
i
really
dug
this
bottle
of
galaxy
white
ipa
and
id
love
to
try
one
thats
much
more
fresh
as
i
think
itd
be
a
very
different
but
still
very
good
beer
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
plus
points
for
being
highly
original
a
definite
must
try
im
stoked
to
drink
this
one
and
could
take
down
another
750ml
no
problem
the
bretts
already
strong
and
im
going
to
find
out
how
funky
this
will
get
im
going
to
buy
another
to
drink
now
and
lay
one
down
for
fun
try
this
beer
o
fairly
light
and
refreshing
the
galaxy
hops
combine
well
with
the
brett
and
wheat
and
spices
very
enjoyable
and
look
forward
to
what
is
next
from
this
brewery
while
it
seems
like
a
lot
thrown
together
coming
into
it
brewing
expertise
is
showcased
in
that
these
guys
can
do
so
much
without
making
it
a
muddled
mes
and
blending
it
all
together
so
well
i
hope
they
come
out
with
more
o
i
thought
this
was
really
good
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
and
i
like
the
effect
of
brett
in
beers
classified
as
a
belgian
ipa
but
open
to
interpretation
hoppy
sure
but
not
really
bitter
this
is
going
to
remind
folks
of
farmhouse
ales
and
witbiers
if
you
like
ales
with
brett
and
barrelaging
you
will
want
to
try
this
had
as
a
part
of
a
free
tasting
held
at
gbx
served
from
bottle
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
spice
coriander
funk
earth
fruit
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
funk
fruit
wheat
and
spice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
very
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
really
like
the
level
of
complexity
that
the
brett
addition
to
the
bottle
added
to
this
brew
this
was
a
fairly
light
ipa
as
the
name
would
imply
so
the
nice
kiss
of
funkiness
went
really
well
here
anchorage
is
definitely
doing
good
things
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
offerings
from
them
that
i
have
not
tried
yet
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
of
this
one
at
first
but
a
few
sips
in
and
i
was
really
digging
it
ipa
is
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
here
this
is
sort
of
an
imperial
wild
wit
or
something
like
that
seek
this
one
out
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
batch
2
april
2012
served
in
a
dfh
signature
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
that
grew
for
a
while
and
took
some
time
to
settle
also
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
lemon
peel
brett
hay
peppery
spice
and
some
coriander
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
the
addition
of
some
white
wine
and
pineapple
flavors
i
liked
the
taste
of
this
beer
more
and
more
the
longer
i
drank
it
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
and
its
very
carbonated
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
although
i
do
wish
the
carbonation
was
lower
13
99
a
bottle
overall
not
bad
i
like
it
but
was
expecting
more
i
would
not
call
this
a
belgian
ipa
but
it
is
admittedly
hard
to
classify
the
brett
aspect
is
most
dominant
so
perhaps
an
american
wild
ale
the
brew
is
delicious
anchorage
really
knows
how
to
do
these
belgians
i
love
their
love
buzz
and
this
is
right
up
there
overall
an
interesting
well
done
beer
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
i
still
dont
really
love
the
blend
of
belgian
yeast
and
the
hops
maybe
fruitier
hops
would
be
better
for
me
id
also
like
more
brett
out
of
this
one
kosher
certified
this
is
a
rewrite
as
apparently
my
first
review
was
not
committed
to
the
database
picked
up
a
bottle
for
12
99
based
upon
my
experience
with
bitter
monk
first
off
this
si
much
more
of
a
wild
ale
than
an
ipa
but
thats
ok
bright
whiteyellow
color
smells
a
lot
like
the
chardonnay
barrel
with
hints
of
brett
and
stink
flavor
is
mostly
brett
fruit
citrus
but
not
necessarily
hops
good
stuff
and
got
me
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
whiteout
wit
50
ibu
o
i
honestly
expected
more
i
was
looking
for
an
experience
like
bitter
monk
and
got
a
slightly
tart
white
ipa
disappointing
overall
especially
at
20bottle
medium
bodied
with
a
very
musty
earthy
flavor
from
the
oak
brett
and
hops
that
dominates
the
flavor
until
it
warms
up
a
bit
dry
toasted
oak
funky
brett
and
coriander
followed
by
earthy
and
citrus
hops
and
vinous
light
fruit
again
im
not
picking
up
the
kumquats
but
they
are
possibly
lingering
underneath
everything
else
the
peppercorn
and
coriander
provide
a
dry
spiciness
that
compliments
the
dry
resinous
hop
flavor
after
a
while
the
white
wine
and
bready
yeast
notes
come
forward
pretty
dry
from
all
of
these
elements
and
the
citrus
characteristic
from
the
galaxy
hop
and
sweetness
from
whine
and
wit
yeast
are
kind
of
overshadowed
slightly
tart
and
dry
toward
the
finish
but
not
sour
more
funky
than
anything
else
pretty
complex
but
could
use
some
more
sweetness
for
balance
i
had
a
couple
of
samples
of
this
at
ebf
6
months
ago
and
it
was
much
different
strong
galaxy
depth
with
brett
complimenting
the
profile
this
bottle
was
all
brett
i
am
going
to
have
to
seek
this
one
out
again
on
a
very
nice
beer
incredibly
complex
yet
still
so
drinkable
this
beer
would
be
an
excellent
introduction
to
brett
extremely
complex
huge
brett
notes
throughout
earth
funk
and
dried
hay
tropical
fruits
wheat
and
spice
a
blend
between
a
wit
american
ipa
funky
saison
and
a
white
wine
i
couldnt
really
ask
for
anything
more
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
its
a
different
take
on
an
ipa
but
its
not
something
i
would
grab
regularly
though
im
not
huge
on
the
white
ipa
style
this
beer
is
definitely
well
done
and
really
enjoyable
im
hoping
i
have
another
beer
stashed
away
somewhere
as
itd
be
interesting
to
see
if
this
one
gets
funkier
with
time
o
very
very
tasty
im
not
big
into
belgian
wheats
but
this
was
a
fantastic
combination
of
belgian
wheatorange
spices
and
hopsbitterness
while
drinking
all
i
could
think
was
well
worth
the
17
50
overall
very
nice
and
different
huge
flavors
that
you
really
need
to
have
many
sips
to
understand
and
enjoy
this
could
easly
be
called
a
saison
with
its
barnyard
funky
flavors
the
price
was
a
little
more
then
it
should
be
but
its
worth
a
drink
for
its
unique
and
huge
flavor
overall
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
as
a
monster
hophead
myself
i
like
the
overall
balance
of
the
beer
to
bring
the
galaxy
forward
but
still
maintain
the
white
aspect
and
add
a
slight
funkiness
to
the
mix
i
wish
this
was
cheaper
and
available
all
the
time
if
it
was
9
id
buy
it
all
the
time
definitely
worth
the
money
for
a
beer
as
unique
as
this
one
still
this
is
a
really
good
brew
refreshing
solid
and
very
very
enjoyable
other
anchorage
beers
might
be
better
but
this
really
nicely
fits
into
the
range
great
stuff
this
was
a
really
tasty
belgian
ipa
with
a
bretty
touch
o
a
well
crafted
classy
beer
the
fruit
and
yeast
balance
each
other
out
and
the
hops
blend
nicely
as
well
anchorage
continues
to
be
one
to
watch
anchorage
lands
in
kentucky
with
a
remarkable
beer
thatll
sure
win
over
lovers
of
both
ipas
and
characterful
belgianstyle
wild
ales
deeply
rooted
in
tradition
and
encouraged
by
experimentation
these
guys
arent
hampered
by
history
they
seem
propelled
by
it
bare
hints
of
sweetness
in
between
the
oaky
middle
and
dry
bitter
finish
grapefruit
pith
oak
champagne
dry
and
clean
equal
parts
brett
funk
and
galaxy
hop
bitterness
with
touches
of
corianderpepper
in
the
background
nicely
structured
complex
layers
emerge
and
lend
unique
aspects
to
the
beer
if
you
ever
dreamed
of
a
hoppy
version
of
calabaza
blanca
this
is
it
very
nice
beer
brisk
effervescence
bright
citrus
from
the
cumquats
spicy
coriander
and
pepper
spicy
citrus
hops
with
a
bit
of
pine
drying
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
at
only
50
ibus
its
got
a
nice
bitterness
nice
lingering
sweetness
as
well
rich
and
complex
beer
the
spice
from
the
coriander
and
peppercorn
go
along
well
with
the
citric
bittering
galaxy
hops
touches
of
passion
fruit
and
citric
fruit
salad
deeply
complex
and
highly
drinkable
lots
of
earthy
yeastiness
musty
funkiness
very
awesome
beer
i
love
it
lots
of
passion
fruit
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
is
also
good
honestly
the
hops
dont
come
through
much
it
is
more
of
a
witbier
with
brett
and
citrus
than
anything
but
it
is
a
refreshing
take
on
it
even
with
the
odd
experimentation
the
bitter
monk
was
unbelievablethe
whiteout
wit
was
horrendous
this
is
closer
to
bitter
monk
but
not
quite
as
awesome
the
sweetness
and
oak
come
through
with
a
few
more
sips
brett
is
tame
with
a
hint
of
funk
and
medicinal
flavor
pretty
low
tartness
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
rocky
white
head
really
nice
hoppiness
on
the
nose
great
citrus
and
pine
with
a
light
floral
character
the
brett
gives
a
good
funk
and
theres
a
lot
of
straw
and
earth
notes
tastewise
the
hops
are
a
little
bit
less
pronounced
very
dry
with
lots
of
earthy
tones
and
a
little
bit
of
straw
and
grass
some
light
malt
character
but
it
doesnt
really
contribute
much
sweetness
overall
the
creativity
of
this
recipe
in
combination
with
the
difficult
but
successful
execution
is
what
really
sets
it
apart
hazy
dull
gold
with
a
dense
white
head
that
settles
to
a
nice
cap
superb
aromas
of
tropical
hops
mango
peach
and
tangerine
white
wine
french
oak
and
spicy
coriander
bitter
hop
flavors
of
tangerine
grapefruit
and
mango
with
a
slightly
funky
wit
yeast
white
grapes
citrus
and
oak
really
good
i
just
wish
the
galaxy
hop
presence
was
more
noticeable
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
with
a
medium
body
and
great
carbonation
another
superb
anchorage
brew
love
these
guys
grade
b
a
good
beer
drinks
more
like
a
nice
berliner
weiss
than
belgian
ipa
but
seems
almost
like
a
waste
to
use
galaxy
in
such
a
minor
starring
role
excellent
funky
take
on
the
style
another
great
one
from
gabe
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
the
addition
of
the
brett
really
adds
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
beer
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
enjoy
sipping
on
this
one
for
quite
a
while
impressive
take
on
the
style
and
one
to
have
again
o
an
excellent
beer
it
is
nice
to
see
that
the
brett
didnt
overpower
the
base

january
2012
notes
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
expectation
but
they
were
pretty
high
given
brett
and
galaxy
hops
and
i
prefer
the
tripel
but
this
was
a
nice
beer
interesting
play
with
the
hops
and
kumquat
could
use
a
bit
more
brett
on
the
taste
but
all
in
all
i
cant
complain
o
overall
while
i
liked
this
beer
it
was
easily
my
least
favourite
from
anchorage
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
o
once
again
anchorage
bends
the
style
guidelines
of
american
craft
beer
and
ends
up
winning
galaxy
is
refreshing
complex
and
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
much
like
the
tide
and
its
takers
i
might
even
grab
a
bottle
or
two
for
aging
that
brett
will
be
something
to
behold
in
a
few
years
time
even
more
than
it
is
now
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
in
body
with
a
modest
amount
of
fine
carbonation
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
is
a
slightly
citrusy
with
a
mellow
yeast
undertone
and
slightly
biting
alcohol
the
initial
nose
was
a
lot
more
intense
and
aromatic
in
comparison
to
several
minutes
later
the
beer
tastes
the
same
way
with
a
lot
yeast
upfront
followed
by
a
lingering
bitterness
its
got
a
slightly
dry
and
packs
a
medium
body
which
is
broken
up
by
ample
carbonation
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
bitter
monk
but
the
yeast
completely
overpowers
the
galaxy

cheers
i
love
what
anchorage
has
been
doing
though
this
did
not
hit
the
spot
for
me
it
is
not
bad
at
all
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
the
chalky
flavorconsistency
that
i
get
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
their
other
offerings
however
m
medium
carbonation
not
enough
to
affect
the
taste
of
the
beer
or
leave
a
sour
note
on
the
tongue
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
white
ipa
the
spices
and
the
wit
yeast
really
compliment
the
galaxy
hops
nicely
the
brett
also
adds
some
nice
complexity
o
always
stellar
products
out
of
anchorage
they
love
using
brett
and
it
works
for
them
m
its
a
medium
bodied
ipa
very
highly
carbonated
which
helps
the
flavors
clear
the
palate
taste
first
reaction
is
a
surprising
division
of
the
mouth
feel
it
feels
like
it
divided
in
half
the
top
being
bright
and
citrusy
while
the
lower
part
is
strangely
dry
and
clear
very
clear
refreshing
vibe
overall
with
a
mild
spicy
bitterness
seeming
to
follow
the
bitter
hops
lingers
forever
almost
uncomfortably
bitter
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
yellowstraw
color
with
a
pretty
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
very
nice
and
interesting
a
mix
of
citrus
from
the
hops
and
spice
from
whatever
else
is
in
here
goes
really
nicely
with
the
brett
unfortunately
the
flavor
isnt
as
exciting
as
the
aromas
was
the
taste
comes
off
more
like
a
belgian
ipa
with
brett
which
is
i
guess
what
this
beer
is
but
the
smell
indicated
it
could
be
more
its
very
hoppybitter
and
a
little
citrusy
with
a
nice
dryness
from
the
brett
and
a
bit
of
oak
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
overall
another
very
tasty
interesting
beer
from
anchorage
its
not
quite
on
the
level
of
bitter
monk
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
ale
brewed
with
galaxy
hops
coriander
kumquats
and
peppercorns
fermented
and
aged
in
french
oak
foudres
with
a
wit

dry

i
just
cant
get
over
how
juicy
this
beer
is
a
real
nice
marriage
nearly
perfect
for
me
really
nice
looking
beer
slightly
opaque
golden
color
with
a
decent
looking
head
it
is
one
finger
but
the
bubbles
are
rather
medium
sized
and
tehy
all
line
up
to
try
and
reach
the
top
to
escape
into
the
atmosphere
my
nose
detects
citrus
orange
lemon
grass
and
then
hay
and
a
slight
note
of
basement
and
funk
yes
some
barrel
too
everything
seems
good
so
far
then
i
tast
the
beer
bummer
right
off
the
bat
it
is
good
hoppy
citrus
forward
flowery
punch
a
hint
of
crisp
white
wine
but
then
dirt
earth
just
poor
fermentation
management
on
the
brett
scene
the
minerally
quality
of
anchorage
brewing
has
got
me
down
mouthfeel
is
overly
spritzy
to
style
a
let
down
im
over
this
brewery
pours
a
clouded
straw
gold
color
big
plume
of
soapy
white
froth
diminishes
slowly
but
leaves
little
lacing
scent
brings
notes
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
grapefruit
and
pineapple
before
musty
earthy
funk
presents
itself
segues
into
a
dry
earthy
grainyness
moderate
spice
taste
lacked
the
hop
punch
or
brett
funk
expected
from
descriptors
on
the
bottle
moderately
bitter
with
light
citrus
and
tropical
notes
mildly
earthy
from
yeast
and
grain
faint
spicing
a
touch
of
sweet
fruit
juice
on
the
end
medium
bodied
lightly
prickly
dry
maybe
a
little
too
much
expected
from
this
and
maybe
a
little
too
much
advertised
on
the
bottle
would
have
liked
a
touch
more
aggressiveness
on
some
flavor
fronts
maybe
the
bottle
just
in
a
weird
spot
with
aging
with
faded
hops
and
muted
brett
mediumlow
body
with
high
hybrid
naturalspritzy
carbonation
exceptionally
dry
very
easy
to
drink
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
overall
nice
stuff
while
this
one
doesnt
bash
you
over
the
head
with
bold
flavors
or
aromas
it
has
subtle
complexity
and
great
balance
gabe
gets
it
done
again
if
he
keeps
it
up
beer
geeks
may
someday
have
to
rerank
the
top
breweries
in
anchorage
and
alaska
with
abc
as
1
and
midnight
sun
as
2
when
i
first
learned
gabe
had
was
leaving
midnight
sun
to
do
his
own
thing
i
was
a
bit
bummed
but
i
am
all
for
it
now
i
love
a
good
belgian
ipa
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
didnt
disappoint
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
if
full
of
brett
with
some
orange
notes
as
well
as
some
bread
from
the
malt
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
a
ton
of
brett
and
orange
citrus
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
bread
and
biscuit
malt
there
is
also
a
nice
yeasty
component
to
the
flavor
and
a
low
amount
of
hop
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
t
not
as
good
as
the
smell
but
still
pretty
tasty
stuff
opens
with
a
touch
of
citrus
sweetness
and
then
moves
towards
a
more
bitter
middle
and
finish
with
grapefruit
pith
brett
biscuity
malt
and
some
peppery
hops
this
beer
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
delicate
interesting
well
balanced
and
incredibly
enjoyable
to
drink
anther
wonderful
brett
beer
from
anchorage
god
i
wish
they
were
a
bit
less
pricey
so
i
felt
like
dropping
the
cash
for
it
more
often
the
brett
is
a
bit
overpowering
in
this
and
it
was
downright
bad
to
the
harsh
pepper
aftertaste
while
cold
but
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
that
receded
and
the
better
the
beer
got
marked
down
a
bit
because
of
the
initial
taste
but
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
was
actually
pretty
good
o
almost
as
good
as
bitter
monk
this
brewery
can
do
no
wrong
in
my
book
this
beer
is
so
complex
and
flavorful
yet
so
smooth
and
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
thank
you
anchorage
d
an
interesting
beer
and
an
interesting
style
white
ipa
refreshing
and
complex
definitely
worth
a
try
drinker
beware
huge
hop
bomb
here
in
hindsight
i
would
give
this
one
a
little
more
time
for
the
hops
to
settle
down
and
for
the
brett
to
do
its
thing
o
this
started
out
slow
but
i
must
say
this
grew
on
me
not
something
i
would
care
to
drink
regularly
but
worth
a
try
not
to
shabby
this
beer
has
a
pale
yellow
slightly
cloudy
color
that
almost
makes
it
look
like
its
glowing
a
nice
thick
head
gives
it
a
stunning
appearance
very
fruity
aroma
with
citrus
and
herbal
notes
characterizing
flavor
for
this
beer
is
a
real
challenge
because
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
changes
so
much
with
almost
every
sip
this
alone
makes
it
exciting
it
started
out
slightly
funky
and
yeasty
which
gradually
mellowed
as
honeysuckle
and
melony
flavors
began
to
peek
through
id
definitely
love
to
try
another
bottle
to
see
if
there
are
differences
between
batches
but
unfortunately
its
pretty
pricey
beer
is
light
in
body
and
very
effervescent
on
the
palate
stinging
and
sweet
with
a
late
oakiness
and
funk
with
a
nice
hop
palate
id
have
it
again
overall
really
nice
use
of
brett
and
i
could
have
gone
for
a
bit
more
hops
in
the
flavor
but
thats
a
minor
complaint
considering
how
much
im
enjoying
this
one
this
beer
just
arrived
in
indianapolis
today
it
pours
a
light
bodied
milky
and
cloudy
pear
juice
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
whispy
head
the
nose
is
dry
and
full
of
brett
with
a
moderate
hop
profile
with
a
good
amount
of
coriander
and
lemon
peel
the
flavors
are
a
really
interesting
mix
of
fresh
and
pungent
hops
with
a
boatload
of
brett
and
dried
citrus
fruits
its
about
as
complex
as
could
be
it
drinks
light
in
body
and
of
course
finishes
dry
and
tart
it
is
just
incredibly
different
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
bt
myself
and
thoroughly
enjoy
it
hut
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
share
with
a
friend
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
for
sure
a
hybrid
ipa
wit
and
saison
in
my
opinion
quite
enjoyable
and
extremely
quaffable
very
glad
to
try
this
beer
thanks
again
dan
overall
this
was
delightful
i
am
already
looking
forward
to
having
it
again
750
ml
bottle
from
ajs
in
aptos
pours
a
pale
gold
color
not
quite
as
light
as
a
wit
or
berliner
weisse
but
still
very
pale
aroma
is
zesty
and
bright
big
tropical
papaya
and
grapefruit
and
pineapple
lemon
verbena
no
trace
of
malt
just
as
it
should
be
flavor
is
a
little
light
on
hops
due
to
the
aging
but
it
still
has
a
solid
tropical
fruit
presence
reminds
me
of
orange
pineapple
juice
a
bit
a
bit
of
musty
oak
and
brett
moderate
bitterness
and
a
lingering
tickle
of
black
pepper
a
very
impressive
beer
o
light
and
hoppy
and
amazing
very
nice
galaxy
hops
combined
with
brett
is
a
dream
come
true
super
fresh
and
juicy
flavors
contrasted
by
the
mustiness
of
the
brett
just
works
brett
is
way
stronger
in
the
aroma
than
the
flavor
highly
recommended
holy
hell
this
was
a
great
beer
and
its
going
to
be
hard
on
my
self
discipline
to
wait
and
see
how
the
funk
levels
develop
in
the
other
bottle
i
have
in
the
basement
this
is
a
very
good
ipa
i
dont
like
the
price
of
it
there
was
a
lot
of
hype
around
this
beer
and
along
with
the
packaging
it
fell
a
bit
short
for
me
though
i
do
not
and
will
not
grade
any
of
my
scores
on
anything
but
the
fluid
there
is
some
nice
brett
character
and
a
slight
funk
to
it
it
is
probably
the
first
ipa
i
would
actually
even
consider
aging
the
base
beer
must
be
stellar
but
beyond
that
a
little
overdone
i
like
the
whiteout
wit
much
better
o
my
favorite
anchorage
beer
since
bitter
monk
and
maybe
my
favorite
overall
i
cant
believe
this
beer
isnt
getting
any
hype
at
some
point
anchorage
will
be
recognized
for
its
greatness
and
people
wont
complain
about
the
price
theyll
offer
their
whole
cellars
to
get
their
hands
on
it
what
gabes
doing
is
virtually
unprecedented
outside
of
belgium
cant
wait
to
see
what
he
does
next
can
you
say
quad
o
not
exactly
a
textbook
witbier
or
ipa
this
is
my
first
experience
with
anchorage
due
to
the
high
cost
of
these
bottles
but
this
bottle
was
given
to
me
so
happy
to
give
it
a
try
i
have
to
say
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
there
really
is
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
and
it
defies
classification
a
bit
i
tend
to
throw
this
into
my
somewhat
catchall
style
of
saison
but
its
even
on
the
fringes
of
that
as
well
might
think
about
getting
another
bottle
of
this
if
i
find
a
deal
and
let
it
age
for
a
while
to
see
what
kind
of
effect
the
brett
has
on
this
for
an
extended
aging
overall
full
of
unique
character
and
very
good
seems
to
me
it
could
benenfit
from
bit
of
sweetness
with
a
little
sugar
to
balance
slightly
i
think
the
flavors
could
sing
update
if
you
want
to
let
this
one
sit
for
about
67
months
the
brett
will
come
out
to
play
with
some
nice
barnyard
and
funk
the
hops
arent
quite
there
anymore
but
still
provide
a
nice
bitterness
the
nose
on
the
beer
has
gone
nuts
in
that
time
as
well
with
some
sourness
and
funk
i
think
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
beer
than
it
delivered
that
said
it
was
an
interesting
beer
and
i
appreciate
the
experimental
nature
of
it
perhaps
a
little
bit
more
of
the
citrusy
witbier
qualities
to
help
balance
out
the
dryness
of
the
wood
aging
would
help
overall
very
nice
great
hops
and
light
brett
characteristics
blended
well
without
either
overpowering
the
other
and
even
a
nice
light
malty
base
to
back
them
up
a
well
done
tasty
beer
this
beers
definitely
a
pleasant
surprise
an
ipa
with
the
malt
balance
of
a
wheat
beer
and
every
bit
as
drinkable
as
the
two
styles
poured
at
the
ebf
night
session
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
pale
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
gave
off
the
aromas
of
bread
citrus
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
of
the
beer
seemed
to
me
like
a
typical
witbier
it
was
citrusy
and
rather
mild
in
flavor
the
peppercorn
didnt
stand
out
too
much
for
me
but
there
was
a
bitterness
in
there
from
the
fruits
that
were
brewed
into
it
the
mouthfeel
was
light
carbonated
and
refreshing
for
the
most
part
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
brew
but
nothing
too
exciting
to
me
excellent
beer
hopforward
yet
it
maintained
the
characteristics
of
classic
belgian
brews

a

o
not
too
surprising
that
this
is
a
massively
hopped
attack
there
is
not

here
it
is
more
like
a

a

for
another

glad
i
tried
it
though
overall
id
drink
it
again
but
thats
as
much
as
i
can
say
awesome
belgian
yeast
and
hops
o
good
tasting
and
quite
drinkable

not

good

overall
glad
i
grabbed
the
last
bottle
of
this
definitely
worth
it
o
very
happy
with
this
beer
passed
it
by
the
first
time
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
last
year
but
i
did
not
pass
it
by
this
time
and
i
was
rewarded
with
a
very
fine
brew
maybe
my
least
favorite
beer
from
these
guys
so
far
and
while
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
i
think
its
over
rated
on
hype
alone
its
overly
belgian
i
mean
way
past
bubblegum
and
high
tone
fruits
its
over
the
top
with
that
probably
fermented
in
the
80
degree
range
or
warmer
and
just
because
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
does
not
make
it
good
its
honey
colored
beer
nice
and
clear
and
holding
on
to
a
very
lacy
white
head
looks
nice
in
the
glass
it
smells
like
leftover
belgian
yeast
and
sweet
oily
west
coast
hops
the
yeast
is
just
too
much
not
that
there
is
sediment
or
anything
but
its
flavor
its
run
wild
away
from
the
reasonable
range
and
feels
almost
sharp
as
a
result
the
beer
isnt
all
that
dry
though
which
i
find
a
little
confusing
the
hop
profile
on
this
is
excellent
i
would
guess
some
simcoe
sticky
and
rich
for
sure
it
just
doesnt
need
this
yeast
intensity
it
would
be
a
far
better
beer
as
an
american
double
ipa
with
some
nondescript
ale
yeast
rather
than
this
white
winey
taffy
even
corny
strain
that
dominates
the
beer
finish
is
long
and
the
alcohol
cuts
sharply
through
the
oily
hoppy
tail
end
leaving
a
boozy
belgian
tang
on
the
tongue
i
appreciate
making
very
very
bold
beers
but
this
one
never
really
comes
together
for
me
that
said
the
rest
of
our
tasting
group
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
i
am
thankful
to
thebrewo
for
having
shared
this
rarity
with
us
overall
one
of
the
better
beligan
ipas
ive
had
i
have
seen
a
lot
of
variation
in
this
beer
but
this
one
is
a
fresh
and
fantastic
not
sure
what
im
tasting
but
theres
tons
of
hops
a
little
spicy
and
yeasty
like
i
said
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
making
me
think
that
might
change
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
o
4
75
what
a
damned
fine
brew
one
of
the
better
dipas
ive
had
in
a
long
time
highly
recommended
life
a
rich
life
is
a
belgian
style
ipa
that
in
thought
was
one
of
the
stoopidest
names
ever
until
i
read
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
that
it
was
dedicated
to
a
young
gentleman
named
rich
sheppard
it
pours
with
an
aggressive
foamy
bright
white
head
it
looks
translucent
amberorange
reminds
me
of
orangecherry
jello
the
taste
isnt
nearly
as
yeasty
as
i
expected
in
fact
i
wouldnt
know
it
was
a
belgian
style
at
all
init
werent
on
the
bottle
taste
was
very
pine
heavy
starts
off
extremely
piney
and
finishes
with
a
heavy
dose
of
citrus
mostly
orange
tangerine
and
pineapple
feel
is
rich
and
creamy
rather
light
and
crisp
while
it
is
def
worth
seeking
out
i
will
say
a
drawback
for
me
is
the
soap
taste
that
some
ipas
have
overall
great
brew
by
one
of
my
fav
breweries
glass
on
tap
at
the
brewery
cloudy
pour
with
ample
head
sweet
aroma
with
some
citrus
notes
first
thing
i
noticed
about
the
taste
was
how
much
it
reminded
me
of
pineapple
tasted
almost
like
those
canned
ringed
pineapples
you
can
buy
in
the
store
after
getting
used
to
this
flavor
i
was
able
to
taste
some
bitterness
and
malt
character
interesting
drink
c
overall
seems
like
it
was
much
better
when
fresh
but
lost
some
character
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
crisp
with
a
sweet
cracker
finish
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
more
easy
access
to
i
still
think
this
is
a
bit
of
a
misunderstood
style
for
most
of
the
hop
heads
out
there
final
word
while
the
sweet
fruit
flavors
on
the
tongue
are
full
and
refreshing
the
finish
is
too
unbalanced
and
potently
bitter
for
a
typical
drinker
while
anyone
can
enjoy
the
flavors
in
the
first
sip
the
dry
bitter
astringent
finish
immediately
overwhelms
them
and
defeats
the
subtle
fruit
flavors
up
front
as
it
stood
it
was
a
beer
that
only
hop
lovers
or
thrill
seekers
could
truly
enjoy
but
anyone
else
should
take
a
pass
for
a
more
trustworthy
ipa
overall
as
a
fan
of
ipas
i
was
eager
to
try
live
a
rich
life
even
more
so
when
i
heard
it
was
a
belgianstyle
double
ipa
heaven
try
this
whenever
possible
o
overall
this
was
a
solid
dipa
just
on
the
older
side
was
probably
once
awesome
o
a
fruit
hop
explosion
that
is
complimented
nicely
by
a
the
peppery
yeast
flavors
one
of
the
better
beligan
ipas
that
ive
tried
very
good
a
great
collaboration
that
clearly
leans
on
the
side
of
a
hoppy
american
three
floyds
ipa
another
winner
from
fff
perfect
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thick
rich
head
when
poured
not
much
of
a
nose
but
great
initial
taste
rich
smooth
flavor
and
the
best
belgium
ipa
ive
come
across
leaves
just
enough
hoppy
bitterness
in
mouth
reaffirms
fff
as
possibly
best
overall
brewer
there
is
overall
i
really
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
belgian
ipas
until
this
beer
fff
pulled
this
off
perfectly
really
an
excellent
and
flavorful
ipa
the
belgian
yeast
and
bright
peppery
flavor
is
completely
complimentary
definitely
a
must
try
imho
cheers
friends
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
not
one
that
i
will
really
crave
however
overall
a
stellar
belgian
ipa
that
drinks
like
an
american
iipa
in
fact
i
thought
it
was
very
reminiscent
of
hopslam
with
just
a
bit
more
hoppiness
and
a
bit
less
sweetness
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
overall
nice
ipa
by
fff
but
i
dont
even
get
the
belgian
contribution
very
good
but
not
that
much
different
than
their
other
hoppy
offerings
delicious
treat
yourself
o
an
awesome
bitter
ipa
with
a
since
belgian
style
twist
very
enjoyable
really
hope
to
get
this
again

are

overshadowed

the

with

citrus
with
strong
resinous
notes
throughout

comes

and

mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
with
a
moderate

overall
the
belgian
qualities
of
this
ipa
are
pretty
mild
which
i
actually
like
im
not
a
fan
of
belgian
yeast
esters
over
taking
the
hop
profile
and
it
is
certainly
not
the
case
here
this
tastes
right
up
the
alley
with
the
rest
of
three
floyds
ipas
o
live
a
rich
life
a
k
a
shark
pants
as
it
was
formally
named
is
a
sheer
piece
of
brewing
class
when
fff
are
bottling
rotating
ales
of
this
quality
they
are
a
brewery
thats
hard
to
beat
i
enjoyed
this
maybe
too
much
as
ive
craved
it
since
lets
hope
this
one
keeps
finding
its
way
into
bottling
distribution
bc
its
one
of
the
best
brews
youll
ever
get
your
hands
on
long
live
rich
life
o
a
very
interesting
and
unique
offering
from
the
floyd
family
i
enjoyed
this
bomber
but
its
not
necessarily
the
beer
id
go
for
when
craving
a
hoppy
brew
balance
leans
strongly
towards
the
herbals
and
pine
throughout
especially
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
verdict
ive
been
enjoying
bombers
of
this
beer
since
the
217
release
and
its
showing
no
signs
of
slowing
down
which
is
admirable
considering
how
quickly
many
of
the
ipas
from
three
floyds
begin
to
wilt
its
definitely
a
maltier
beer
than
what
fits
the
fff
stereotype
but
its
still
a
great
hoppy
beer
and
one
of
the
fruitier
ipas
theyve
made
the
belgian
yeast
adds
a
great
level
of
intrigue
to
this
and
its
not
one
to
be
missed
easily
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
on
the
market
appearance
was
a
reddish
amber
color
not
much
of
a
nose
on
this
taste
was
straight
up
bitter
i
couldnt
detect
any
real
hops
just
pure
bitterness
very
dry
with
almost
no
sweetness
the
opposite
of
a
juicy
ipa
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
beer
but
it
fell
short
for
me
if
i
wasnt
told
this
was
brewed
with
belgian
yeast
i
probably
would
have
never
picked
it
out
this
is
in
my
mind
a
juicy
ripe
extremely
drinkable
iipa
three
floyds
brews
some
better
versions
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
in
no
way
a
slouch
rip
rich
you
have
an
excellent
beer
brewed
in
your
honor
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
effort
by
three
floyds
o
one
of
the
best
fff
i
had
in
a
long
time
probably
since
in
the
name
of
suffering
i
was
able
to
score
only
two
of
these
bad
boys
and
i
want
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
take
my
time
overall
a
fine
belgium
ipa
overall
very
good
more
like
a
dipa
if
you
ask
me
really
want
to
try
shark
pants
now

bitter
at
the
first
taste
but
it
does
follow
the
aroma
quite
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
full
and
a
little
over
carbonated
like
most
3

this
is
overpriced
but
worth
a
try

floyds

feel
from
the
loads

milt
is
mildly
sticky
and
sweet
and
carbonation
is
moderate
to
high
there
is
also
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
dipa
that
just
doesnt
quite
hit
the
right
notes
for
me
theres
too
much
sweetness
and
a
harsh
alcohol
bite
that
makes
it
a
nice
beer
to
try
but
a
beer
i
wouldnt
clamor
for
again
o
very
nice
a
hop
forward
ale
for
sure
the
yeast
doesnt
impart
much
flavor
but
the
malt
certainly
is
noticeable
i
recommend
this
but
i
prefer
zombie
dust
and
a
cow
much
more
the
appearance
is
my
favorite
aspect
o
another
delicious
iipa
from
three
floyds
i
dont
even
hesitate
when
a
new
one
is
available
to
buy
they
are
always
worth
it
o
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
three
floyds
yeah
it
even
beats
zombie
dust
as
usual
theres
a
lot
of
hop
character
in
the
nose
and
palate
but
its
never
tonguesmackingly
bitter
here
the
hops
are
offered
up
to
the
palate
like
a
gourmet
spice
with
everything
this
beer
has
going
for
it
its
safe
to
say
that
its
pleasing
beyond
just
i
like
this
taste
or
that
taste
so
this
fits
my
palate
as
far
as
im
concerned
three
floyds
has
come
just
about
as
close
to
bottling
happiness
as
any
brewer
can
what
a
way
to
remember
rich
cheers
o
another
exceptional
iipa
from
three
floyds
brewing
company
i
would
compare
this
more
to
permanent
funeral
than
i
would
arctic
panzer
wolf
or
dreadnaught
well
worth
the
11
99
price
tag
for
a
bomber
oa
good
beer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
like
some
of
fffs
other
ipa
but
it
was
still
good
o
i
dont
get
much
of
the
belgium
coming
through
in
this
beer
but
is
fantastic
never
the
less
o
another
fantastic

one

my
faves

fff
highly
recommended
pours

is

aroma
on
the
nose
very
inviting
really
slick
oily
resiny
mouthfeel
fairly
thin
and
very
west
coast
style
body
the
taste
is
quite
aggressively
bitter
with
some
citrus
rind
and
sweet
pine
there
is
some
fruitiness
to
the
flavor
put
this
isnt
a
citrus
juice
bomb
so
go
elsewhere
if
youre
looking
for
that
very
unique
and
interesting
hard
to
place
the
hop
bill
but
it
plays
well
together
only
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
im
not
getting
the
belgian
notes
but
im
fine
with
that
really
aggressively
bitter
but
just
enough
fruitiness
to
make
it
enjoyable
really
fun
drink
the
only
other
thing
id
note
is
that
as
it
warms
the
finish
is
quite
boozy
i
have
been
holding
onto
a
bottle
of
live
a
rich
life
for
at
least
a
year
waiting
for
the
right
moment
to
pop
it
well
fathers

as
good
as
any
the
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
copper
with
12
finger
thick
head
that
is
leaving
a
nice
lace
i
left
a
heal
in
the
bottle
to
keep
the
sediment
from
getting
into
my
tulip
glass
the
scent
includes
belgium
malt
and
fresh
hops
that
provide
citrus
slight
pine
and
some
floral
tones
the
taste
briefly
bitter
then
a
nice
sweet
malt
comes
to
the
rescue
to
balance
the
beer
settling
into
a
smooth
slightly
bitter
peppery
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
falls
in
line
with
all
the
really
awesome
small
batch
beers
that
3f
brews
o
no
surprises
here
exceptional
o
appearance
and
smell
stands
out
above
all
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
but
that
does
carry
the
caveat
that
this
beer
has
about
six
months
on
it
a
fresh
beer
might
taste
differently
im
actually
a
little
surprised
there
isnt
more
of
a
belgian
ale
taste
thats
kind
of
what
i
was
looking
for
but
this
looks
and
tastes
like
a
straight
dipa
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
this
one
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
finger
or
two
of
tight
offwhite
foam
nice
head
retention
and
lacing
bold
juicy
hops
make
their
presence
quickly
known
grapefruit
lemons
and
tangerine
lightly
toasted
bready
malt
detected
as
the
beer
gets
a
chance
to
breathe
though
the
citrusy
hops
are
pervasive
and
continue
to
stick
around
as
you
might
expect
from
the
nose
flavor
skews
heavily
towards
fruity
hops
with
mandarin
coming
into
the
fold
along
with
an
herbal
component
since
the
beer
is
classified
as
a
belgian
ipa
i
would
expect
more
belgian
yeasty
esters
but
im
not
detecting
them
at
a
level
that
ive
found
in
other
examples
of
the
style
finishes
mediumdry
with
a
lingering
grapefruit
juice
mediumlight

moderate
level

three
floyds
consistently
does
a
great
job
with
their
lineup
and
im
especially
a
fan
of
beers
in
which
they
feature
hop
forward
flavors
no
exception
here
well
done
o
a
tasty
take
on
the
style
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
tasty
this
is
a
solid
ipa
not
getting
much
of
the
belgian
flavors
but
maybe
its
because
its
so
hopped
up
and
still
fairly
fresh
that
the
hops
take
over
the
majority
of
it
dont
get
me
wrong
its
not
a
hop
bomb
theyre
very
well
balanced
and
blend
in
perfectly
with
the
rest
of
the
beers
features
pick
this
one
up
for
sure
if
you
see
it
a
cool
beer
but
not
really
something
im
going
to
clamor
for
fff
to
make
again
and
again
o
im
not
sure
its
geared
toward
belgian
ipa
like
the
style
implies
but
its
definitely
a
great
beer
theres
just
a
lot
of
balance
in
this
beer
between
the
hops
and
malt
o
nice
dipa
but
dont
see
how
this
is
classified
as
belgian
style
dipa

i
really
dont

overall
i
had
heard
that
this
was
the
same
beer
as
shark
pants
but
only
brewed
at
fff
not
sure
if
thats
true
but
my
impressions
certainly
are
the
similar
this
is
a
bitter
bomb
the
shark
pants
i
had
from
de
struise
was
way
more
barleywine
like
so
i
wonder
if
it
wasnt
as
fresh
as
this
either
way
this
is
a
hopheads
dream
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
while
still
fresh
didnt
blow
my
mind
but
a
solid
ipa
not
so
much
belgian
a
lot
of
the
flavors
and
textures
that
i
love
so
much
about
dreadnaught
manifests
themselves
here
but
where
dreadnaught
is
focused
on
the
dialogue
of
hops
and
malt
this
more
complex
and
characterful
version
is
reinforced
with
the
yeasty
spice
and
estery
fruits
from
belgian
influences
to
show
artistry
in
recipe
formulation
and
perfection
in
brewing

of
the
most
complex
dipas
as
far
as
aroma
goes
taste
is
similar
lots
of
pineapple
mango
grapefruit
lemon
and
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
chewy
and
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
is
like
dreadnaught
with
belgian
yeast
awesome
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
fff
has
produced
they
seem
to
be
outdoing
their
year
rounds
on
purpose
this
has
all
the
bitterness
youd
want
from
an
iipa
like
dreadnaught
on
steroids
and
with
tropical
fruit
abound
tastes
very
much
as
it
smells
starts
out
of
with
lightly
bitter
fruit
nodesorange
peel
and
white
pepperwhich
veer
impressively
into
pine
grapefruit
and
orange
before
calming
down
into
a
peppery
finish
of
burny
alcohol
o
this
is
solid
i
dont
know
how
id
tell
this
is
a
belgian
ipa
if
you
gave
it
to
me
blind
id
swear
it
was
an
american
interpretation
maybe
its
the
dryness
either
way
its
damn
good
o
very
nice
the
belgian
aspect
is
pretty
muted
but
this
is
a
nice
dipa
o
smells
and
tastes
great
the
label
says
belgian
but
i
got
more
west
coast
ipa
very
nice
absolutely
love
it
once
again
a
new
beer
from
these
guys
still
suprises
me
just
goes
to
show
this
is
the
best
brewing
company
around
i
walked
in
asked
about
the
beer
got
an
honest
response
purchased
it
an
it
was
even
better
than
described
these
guys
are
their
own
scene
and
their
beer
is
the
best
period
o
another
excellent
beer
by
3
floyds
even
those
who
dont
like
said
one
would
love
this
beer
very
good
balance
between
sweetness
hippiness
and
alcohol
content
i
enjoyed
this
one
one
tap
3
floyds
and
will
definetly
pick
up
a
couple
of
bombers
to
go
on
the
way
out
evevn
1522oz
its
worth
it
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
quite
exceptional
with
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
and
tropical
fruit
aromas
taste
is
of
citrus
zest
slight
tropical
fruit
malt
and
some
belgian
yeast
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
with
a
fantastic
smell
o
picked
this
up
at
dld
12
such
a
good
beer
tropical
fruit
delight
could
easily
drink
this
with
breakfast
if
you
have
a
chance
please
pick
this
one
up
o
picked
this
one
up
on
a
whim
at
dld
and
now
im
wishing
i
picked
up
a
few
more
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
really
was
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
paired
it
with
some
charcuterie
from
smoking
goose
and
it
couldnt
have
complemented
it
any
better
fruity
juicy
and
hoppy
make
this
one
a
very
easy
drinker
highly
drinkable
althought
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
style
for
whatever
reason
this
is
much
tastier
than
when
i
had
it
last
summer
on
tap
from
fff
thanks
egrace84
for
the
revisit
poured
from
bomber
into
dimple
glass
mug
pours
bright
orange
with
a
good
white
head
beautiful
lacing
that
lasts
throughout
wonderful
citrus
and
floral
aroma
mild
hops
beligan
yeast
some
pink
bubblegum
and
sweet
fruit
medium
bodied
great
carbonation
stickymouth
feel
overall
a
really
nice
tamed
down
version
of
dreadnaught
m
medium
bodied
cost
15
for
a
22
oz
bottle
o
i
havent
had
many
but
this
is
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
great
fff
hop
character
that
is
only
enhanced
by
the
tasty
belgian
yeast
ill
definitely
pick
this
up
again
o
this
is
an
incredible
beer
really
blends
the
glory
of
american
hops
with
belgian
yeast
in
a
great
way
can
we
get
this
in
six
packs
o
what
happens
if
you
take
dreadnaught
and
brew
it
with
belgian
yeast
you
get
this
beer
solid
dipa
however
i
was
hoping
for
the
belgian
aspects
to
shine
through
a
bit
more
instead
of
playing
such
a
small
role
o
the
best
belgian
ipa
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
is
just
absolutely
fantastic
i
couldnt
be
happier
that
they
are
bottling
it
although
very
expensive
6
for
a
glass
in
brewpub
or
a
15
bottle
ouch
this
is
one
to
seek
out
period
wonderful
also
had
in
a
bottle
picked
up
on
dld
great
as
well
taste
of
the
citrus
and
hops
blends
very
well
making
this
an
easy
drinker
i
wish
i
had
bought
a
second
bottle
would
drink
again
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
belgian
double
india
pale
ales
out
there
floyds
once
again
takes
a
style
and
dominates
it
with
those
amazing
fresh
hop
notes
dont
overlook
this
one
and
grab
it
if
you
have
a
chance
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
much
better
than
stone
calibelgique
and
on
par
with
raging
bitch
o
glad
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
quite
a
few
times
definitely
a
treat
this
beer
is
driven
by
the
classic
fff
hop
profile
balanced
out
with
a
solid
caramel
backbone
and
the
hints
of
belgian
yeast
which
make
it
unique
from
the
other
dipas
fff
makes
above
all
else
is
the
great
cause
this
beer
supports
nothing
like
giving
back
to
help
out
your
favorite
brewery
overall
stellar
overall
my
notes
just
say
really
good
and
after
having
the
good
fortune
to
try
this
a
second
time
i
have
to
agree
with
my
initial
assessment
it
is
a
really
good
beer
i
hope
theres
some
left
out
there
for
a
few
more
of
you
bas
to
try
this
is
a
excellent
belgian
ipa
at
three
floyds
with
sean
and
mike
dark
copper
orange
with
an
awesome
bright
white
head
great
lacing
aroma
of
fruit
oranges
a
little
belgian
yeast
ok
the
taste
is
a
little
to
solvent
hoppy
on
the
front
but
its
fruity
and
hides
the
9
really
well
overall
impression
very
nice
complexed
beer
but
for
a
belgian
ipa
not
too
impressive
im
starting
to
like
how
much
complexity
and
different
flavorsingredients
they
bring
to
each
and
every
drink
this
one
was
much
harder
to
drink
but
still
thought
it
was
a
good
brew
very
limited
batch
so
get
your
hands
on
it
if
you
can
the
flavor
brings
quite
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
especially
as
it
warms
nice
combination
of
floral
citrus
and
piney
hops
everything
there
plays
really
well
with
the
yeast
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
bitter
in
the
finish
quite
bitter
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
ever
had
lush
feel
big
citrusy
orange
and
layered
tropical
fruit
notes
with
an
undercurrent
of
bitter
earthiness
of
resiny
pine
and
aspirin
creamy
feel
extra
smooth
at
260
ibu
its
surprisingly
not
intensely
bitter
very
tasty
and
deceptively
strong
cheers
to
fff
and
struise
on
their
successful
collaboration
shark
pants
is
like
dreadnaught
on
the
mediumbodied
side
of
the
double
ipa
mouthfeel
continuum
soft
carbonation
helps
to
amplify
the
tropical
fruit
flavors
overall
this
is
good
stuff
its
as
good
as
dreadnaught
in
the
abstract
but
i
am
forced
to
dock
it
halfpoints
in
a
few
areas
for
not
reaching
its
belgianyeast
potential
very
solid
beer
would
love
to
have
again
overall
a
too
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
alas
only
available
on
tap
this
beer
pours
a
nice
muddled
copper
in
color
with
light
cloudiness
it
arrived
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
which
dissipated
within
a
minute
or
so
it
smells
like
an
imperial
version
of
alpha
king
it
smells
of
light
and
resinous
piny
hops
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
it
tastes
of
sweet
and
resinous
hops
and
there
is
little
to
no
belgian
characteristics
wheres
the
yeast
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
drinks
decently
for
the
abv
its
not
what
i
wanted
but
its
solid
the
artwork
is
legendary
which
is
why
they
should
bottle
it
very
nice
a
fantastic
belgian
ipa
but
i
still
prefer
the
house
versions
of
american
ipas
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
particularly
for
the
style
would
easily
drink
this
again
ogreat
beer
they
set
the
bar
here
overall
tasty
but
not
a
massive
departure
from
the
other
dipas
in
the
fff
ouvre
absolutely
worth
trying
though
d
i
seem
to
have
encountered
two
awesome
belgian
dipas
after
a
long
dry
spell
i
think
brewers
at
least
in
the
midwest
are
finally
realizing
the
potential
for
belgain
yeast
and
malt
backbones
combined
with
american
hops
and
not
just
early
in
the
boil
if
this
comes
out
in
bottles
ill
certainly
buy
one
or
two
o
im
stunned
this
is
only
8
5
abv
it
is
a
leviathan
of
a
beer
little
beers
that
drink
like
bigger
beers
always
rate
well
for
me
but
this
is
almost
too
much
still
really
well
done
although
drinkability
is
definitely
below
average
alcohol
seems
a
bit
hidden
in
this
ive
tried
this
once
on
tap
out
of
a
snifter
and
then
found
it
again
at
a
locals
only
brew
fest
please
believe
that
i
wore
out
my
welcome
at
their
tasting
tent
o
delicious
beer
well
balanced
and
packed
with
flavor
could
drink
plenty
of
this
beer
for
sure
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
collaboration
the
yeast
added
a
wonderful
creaminess
that
really
smoothed
this
out
will
def
buy
bottles
whenever
they
start
doing
that
o
i
really
love
what
they
did
with
this
one
the
hops
fruit
notes
and
urbains
yeast
really
makes
something
to
enjoy
very
easy
to
drink
and
def
a
treat
being
able
to
try
this
best
of
all
proceeds
from
this
beer
goes
to
a
former
fff
employee
who
recently
passed
away
cheers
to
fff
and
urbain
o
fantastic
beer
almost
hard
to
explain
how
good
this
is
i
had
two
of
them
and
then
followed
it
up
with
a
dreadnaught
the
dreadnaught
is
100
ibus
but
it
actually
tasted
bland
after
the
shark
pants
this
beer
really
is
a
hop
explosion
try
it
if
you
can
it
is
worth
it
o
this
beer
to
me
was
very
good
after
having
a
couple
snifters
of
this
i
must
say
these
two
need
to
do
many
many
more
brews
together
the
flavors
were
settle
and
while
the
hops
dominated
everything
they
didnt
go
too
out
of
their
way
in
making
this
a
palate
crushing
beer
the
alcohol
was
present
only
toward
the
ending
and
did
a
good
job
at
not
over
drying
the
palate
will
be
looking
forward
to
trying
this
in
a
bottle
if
they
ever
bottle
it
a
must
try
3f
belgian
ale
o
a
nice
take
on
the
style
try
it
get
down
here
and
try
it
it
is
currently
no
growlers
and
might
not
be
bottled
o
mostly
sweet
and
malty
with
lots
of
woodsy
notes
but
not
so
much
bourbon
it
all
seems
to
mesh
well
though
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
mellow
but
smooth
with
subtle
fruit
flavors
goes
down
easy
really
like
this
a
lot
the
rest
very
interesting
the
belgian
yeast
is
very
pronounced
and
lends
a
ton
of
character
but
the
barrel
aging
is
pretty
muted
other
than
being
a
bit
flat
this
is
really
drinkable
for
over
9
overall
this
is
a
nice
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
i
just
wish
there
were
more
hops
to
it
couldnt
ask
for
a
better
beer
d
this
was
a
really
interesting
brew
with
a
great
balance
of
bourbon
character
and
hops
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
but
the
finish
was
really
smooth
with
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
fantastic
poured
from
a
750ml
bomber
half
a
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
pours
a
golden
orange
thats
opaque
aromas
of
orange
citrus
hops
and
slight
pine
delightful
citrus
orange
on
the
tongue
with
very
little
pine
bite
back
very
mellow
hints
of
horrible
bowmans
cheap
bourbon
but
it
seriously
tames
the
ipa
into
a
truly
delightful
and
drinkable
beer
dump
the
bowmans
for
two
brothers
and
this
would
be
the
best
dipa
ever
expensive
and
tastes
like
it
enjoyed
with
some
friends
over
thanksgiving
a
friend
who
cannot
stand
barrel
aged
beers
or
hops
actually
found
this
quite
tasty
not
saying
that
this
was
the
only
positive
comment
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
as
well
great
blend
of
the
two
styles
ba
and
dipa
sure
wish
i
could
get
more
hardywood
in
colorado
incredibly
underrated
beer
its
very
decadent
and
doesnt
try
to
kick
you
in
the
face
with
hops
the
barrel
adds
another
layer
of
complexity
to
this
amazing
dipa
so
smooth
rich
and
well
balanced
with
amazing
aromas
that
are
followed
by
the
taste
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
can
get
it
well
done
hardywood
a
in
my
book
hardywood
repeatedly
sets
the
bar
at
a
higher
level
big
whiskey
and
vanilla
flavor
with
a
hoppy
citrus
spike
towards
the
middle
touch
of
toffee
flavors
excellent
beer
and
the
best
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
so
far
o
a
nuanced
beer
with
a
good
mix
of
barrel
qualities
strong
malt
character
and
moderate
hopping
to
bring
a
lighter
feeling
more
subdued
but
flavorful
ba
dipa
i
get
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
part
but
missing
a
bit
on
the
ipa
side
perhaps
its
a
nice
bourbon
barrel
ale
a
bit
dry
and
maybe
i
am
missing
something
in
the
balance
which
i
try
to
applaud
in
most
beers
to
debateable
success
but
the
beer
seems
a
bit
pedestrian
even
writing
that
seems
harsher
than
intended
i
will
say
that
the
price
relative
to
other
beers
seemed
unjustified
but
if
i
ignored
that
i
would
grab
this
again
in
the
right
situation
so
aside
from
the
fact
it
comes
off
like
a
clashing
mess
where
is
the
belgian
character
in
this
neither
hop
driven
nor
even
very
well
complimentary
barrel
forgiving
this
just
doesnt
work
the
idea
of
an
ipa
in
a
bourbon
barrell
seemed
odd
but
it
really
worked
as
it
cranked
up
the
honey
like
sweetness
and
thickness
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
bourbon
treatment
in
hoppy
beers
though
i
have
had
a
few
that
i
have
enjoyed
while
the
aroma
of
this
one
was
promising
it
was
just
too
bourbon
dominant
for
my
palate
onot
generally
a
fan
of
barrelaged
dipas
but
this
was
a
good
one
nice
balance
and
depth
of
flavor
overall
cant
say
i
loved
this
one
a
decent
beer
o
the
nose
on
this
one
is
fantastic
but
for
me
the
booze
takes
over
way
too
quickly
if
i
drank
this
blind
i
would
say
it
was
a
barrelaged
barleywine
there
are
not
too
many
dipa
characteristics
left
in
this
beer
and
the
belgian
yeast
was
hardly
noticeable
overall
a
really
big
complex
and
strong
beer
very
bourbon
forward
with
some
decent
hops
theres
no
way
i
could
tell
without
reading
the
bottle
this
is
a
belgium
style
ipa
the
whiskey
aspect
is
big
bold
and
dominate
this
makes
the
balance
of
the
beer
suffer
some
its
really
warm
too
the
alcohol
is
as
present
as
the
whiskey
is
theses
few
issues
is
what
keeps
me
from
rating
the
overall
higher
none
the
less
this
is
super
tasty
if
your
into
barrel
aged
beers
with
loads
of
flavor
m
medium
body
slightly
oily
fairly
dry
overall
light
carbonation
o
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
on
one
hand
there
is
a
fresh
green
grassy
hop
character
of
an
ipadipa
a
firm
sweet
malty
base
loaded
with
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
and
noticeable
alcohol
component
of
a
barley
wine
and
the
addition
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
giving
more
complexity
with
woody
boozy
earthy
and
vanilla
flavors
this
all
varies
at
times
throughout
the
bottle
between
working
well
together
and
missing
the
mark
a
bit
overall
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
but
recognize
there
are
some
minor
flaws
o
overall
a
good
brew
i
dig
the
hoppiness
combined
with
the
sweet
combination
of
brew
and
barrel
a
great
beer
to
crack
open
to
celebrate
o
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
glad
to
try
it
was
nervous
due
to
it
not
being
fresh
but
those
hops
held
up
wonderfully
well
done
hardywood
overall
great
not
much
else
needs
to
be
said
except
a
lot
of
great
flavors
combined
well
that
balance
each
other
for
a
big
drinking
beer
thats
tasty
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
and
funkydelic
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
recent
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
sweetwater
15th
anniversary
snifter
poured
redorange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wood
earth
earth
hop
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wood
earth
fruit
caramel
and
vanilla
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
went
into
the
one
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
if
i
am
completely
honest
however
what
i
found
was
a
very
pleasant
allaround
brew
that
had
a
nice
touch
of
complexity
on
all
aspects
it
maintained
all
of
this
while
still
remaining
refreshing
i
probably
would
not
have
been
able
to
guess
that
this
one
was
in
a
bourbon
barrel
or
any
barrel
for
that
matter
but
that
didnt
change
the
fact
that
it
was
quite
tasty
really
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
with
good
company
even
if
you
dont
have
the
good
company
part
i
still
suggest
you
trying
it
tick
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
citrus
light
wheat
taste
is
also
strong
of
citrus
a
bit
of
wheat
is
present
a
touch
of
spice
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
blue
moon
appearance
ipa
taste
d
this
was
a
nice
ipa
not
exactly
sure
what
makes
it
white
the
scent
and
taste
were
decent
and
the
body
was
nice
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
but
still
enjoyable
this
is
one
heck
of
a
hybrid
ale
wit
grain
bill
strong
ale
yeast
american
ipa
hopping
sizeable
head
good
lace
wispy
covering
cloudy
orange
gold
nose
is
lively
with
wheat
twang
light
pils
breadiness
tropical
fruit
hops
taste
is
an
amalgam
and
it
works
out
beautifully
light
malty
body
that
seems
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
huge
hop
content
but
the
yeast
and
mellower
hop
artifacts
bring
a
balance
to
the
finish
that
makes
this
highly
quaffable
and
refreshing
feel
is
smooth
with
a
mild
carbonation
that
brings
a
gentle
dubbing
of
the
mouth
i
like
this
stuff
its
hard
to
define
out
pigeonhole
bit
its
good
pours
a
nice
light
yellow
color
with
a
decent
head
and
some
off
the
chain
amazing
lacing
that
coats
the
inside
of
the
glass
and
holds
on
for
dear
life
aroma
is
full
of
grapefruit
taste
is
decent
hop
bitterness
and
some
grapefruit
and
citrus
peel
feel
on
the
palate
is
thick
and
holds
on
for
dear
life
before
going
down
the
gullet
good
hopped
beer
this
is
the
beer
you
give
you
13
year
old
that
thinks
they
want
to
drink
beer
they
will
never
touch
it
again
lol
very
bitter
strong
grapefruit
taste
and
thick
on
the
tongue
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
a
nice
white
ipa
with
the
touches
of
wheat
as
well
as
the
moderate
hop
presence
definitely
worth
grabbing
and
better
than
i
expected
o
solid
very
drinkable
just
nothing
outstanding
decent
but
nothing
real
special
here
i
dont
get
the
white
part
really
at
least
not
as
much
as
others
in
the
style
its
only
a
little
cloudy
and
wheaty
still
more
of
a
regular
ipa
to
me
in
grain
composition
and
flavor
although
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
belgian
yeast
fruitiness
to
this
that
may
take
it
there
but
its
so
subtle
as
to
be
an
accent
the
hops
are
also
a
little
mild
for
what
i
like
an
in
ipa
and
would
call
this
more
in
the
session
family
except
its
over
6
abv
so
it
doesnt
really
fit
there
either
i
need
to
assess
this
just
as
a
beer
not
how
well
it
fits
into
a
style
especially
one
as
poorly
defined
as
a
white
ipa
its
clean
drinking
no
yeast
or
grain
weight
to
this
slowing
it
down
and
carbonation
is
high
all
of
which
i
like
but
i
am
looking
for
more
hops
in
this
and
for
a
sturdiness
that
matches
its
alcohol
content
overall
a
good
beer
it
gives
you
the
taste
of
an
ipa
with
the
look
of
a
witbeir
a
nice
combo
in
my
opinion
an
almost
perfect
white
ipaamerican
wheat
ale
absolutely
lovely
cant
understand
why
this
is
sub90
rjt
nothing
special
but
solid
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
spicy
ipas
o
tasty
interesting
and
easy
drinking

overall
more
a
tangy
grapefruit
ipa
vs
a
true
belgian
influenced
ipa
no
matter
it
tastes
very
good
o
delicious
white
ipa
overall
its
more
of
a
weak
pale
ale
and
doesnt
really
come
across
as
anything
even
remotely
different
in
this
style
overall
i
wish
i
would
have
tried
this
sooner
what
an
awesome
ipa
sweetwater
never
fails
to
disappoint
with
just
about
every
beer
they
release
o
they
claim
it
to
be
a
500
yo
belgian
recipe
hit
with
a
truck
load
of
hops
and
that
is
pretty
much
what
you
get
this
is
definitely
worth
having
again
o
not
crazy
about
this
one
very
flavorful
not
much
belgian
character
too
bitter
for
my
liking
couldnt
get
past
the
phenols
not
a
bad
offering
from
sweetwater
its
not
what
i
typically
look
for
in
an
american
ipa
it
lacks
a
substantial
malt
backbone
and
feels
a
bit
sharp
and
thin
but
the
flavor
is
rather
nice
i
like
the
fruity
character
of
the
hops
and
found
this
beer
to
be
one
you
want
to
drink
2
or
3
of
o
definitely
a
different
take
on
the
ipa
but
not
unwelcome
its
light
refreshing
and
easy
to
like
the
ale
is
a
little
messy
but
is
still
quite
desirable
as
it
does
something
compelling
and
unique
creamydry
like
american
ale
fruity
and
spicy
like
belgian
ale
and
then
with
a
clean
perfume
character
that
is
somewhat
flamboyant
this
is
likable
enough
and
not
offensive
at
all
but
it
feels
like
sweetwater
really
played
it
safe
and
went
the
moderate
route
not
sure
its
worth
a
purchase
over
other
white
ipas
this
yar
like
accumulation
nice
work
and
cheers
to
the
brewmaster
m
light
bodied
certainly
well
carbonated
great
drink
ability
overall
better
than
expected
o
the
aroma
got
me
all
pumped
up
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
wasnt
quite
as
good
still
one
of
the
better
white
ipas
ive
had
even
if
im
missing
the
white
part
pours
a
beautiful
clear
amber
with
some
white
head
hoppy
aroma
has
a
strong
citrus
undertone
more
mandarin
orange
than
grapefruit
flavor
is
monumentally
hoppy
and
has
a
bold
sour
citrus
tone
as
much
grapefruit
as
mandarin
orange
texture
is
quite
fizzy
so
you
feel
it
inside
you
as
it
heads
downstairs
this
is
one
whiplash
you
will
be
glad
you
got
o
this
beer
isnt
amazing
and
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
its
new
and
i
love
what
sweetwater
has
to
offer
i
think
its
solid
and
well
balanced
id
recommend
you
try
it
at
least
once
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
im
likely
to
buy
again
its
refreshing
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
drinkable
maintains
its
ipa
teeth
rather
nicely
so
i
noticed
this
beer
in
publix
and
had
never
seen
it
before
so
here
we
are
i
really
like
this
beer
it
seems
to
be
vastly
different
from
sweetwater
has
usually
done
has
a
great
balance
and
all
in
all
is
very
drinkable
this
is
pretty
new
beer
and
i
would
definitely
suggest
you
go
and
pick
some
up
to
try
for
yourself
o
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
it
was
very
well
balanced
with
a
nice
complexity
i
will
be
having
this
many
more
times
to
come
pale
golden
amber
appearance
with
haze
in
the
body
made
it
clear
that
this
was
a
beer
drawing
on
both
ipa
and
wheat
beer
traditions
the
smell
was
sweet
delicate
floral
and
lightly
citric
the
taste
struck
a
good
balance
between
a
witbier
and
an
ipa
as
i
could
first
detect
bubblegum
banana
and
a
peppery
yeast
and
then
got
a
dose
of
grapefruit
and
some
pine
this
was
not
quite
a
thorough
melding
of
the
two
style
but
more
of
a
layering
effect
with
two
distinct
waves
of
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
soft
being
close
to
basically
a
witbier
while
the
finish
was
drawn
out
hops
similar
to
but
not
quite
as
intense
as
an
ipa
nicely
done
blend
of
styles
o
sweetwater
nails
this
belgian
ipa
glad
to
have
a
new
seasonal
a
very
close
cousin
to
their
ipa
but
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
great
brew
ill
admit
my
first
belgian
ipa
my
frame
of
reference
is
trappist
brews
and
american
ipas
the
ipaness
is
there
but
it
feels
like
a
good
belgian
ale
not
a
good
ipa
i
will
have
to
reevaluate
great
beer
perfect
blend
of
belgian
yeast
and
hops
just
tasted
this
beer
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
hazy
beer
smells
sweet
and
alcoholic
taste
is
odd
sweet
then
fruity
then
bitter
as
hell
bitterness
keeps
growing
with
each
sip
it
was
hard
to
enjoy
very
odd
taste
different
than
any
other
belgian
mensjournal100best2014
on
cask
amazing
kick
at
the
end
interesting
beer
overall
was
looking
for
something
different
and
this
indeed
was
good
beer
but
nothing
special
smells
good
looks
good
but
the
combination
isnt
as
good
as
i
taught
o
2
to
me
this
is
not
a
belgian
style
ipa
but
rather
an
ipa
mixed
with
a
belgian
golden
and
tripel
i
understand
that
belgian
yeast
strains
are
used
in
the
production
but
there
is
just
way
too
much
bubblegum
and
spice
in
this
for
me
to
call
it
an
ipa
at
all
didnt
enjoy
this
one
bit
and
thus
cannot
recommend
it
belgian
fruity
smell
belgian
yeast
and
banana
up
front
and
hoppy
citrusy
pine
in
the
back
this
was
very
good
liked
the
style
which
i
hadnt
had
too
many
of
before
good
balance
yeah
this
is
an
excellent
beer
nice
to
find
recently
tapped
as
gf
isnt
easy
to
find
fresh
unique
hybrid
and
very
different
trippel
up
front
ipa
in
the
back
very
interesting
belgian
sweetness
and
then
a
hop
bitterness
not
really
a
fan
of
the
taste
kind
of
like
india
pale
shock
top
but
pretty
fruity
good
beer
too
much
belgium
for
me
but
well
done
for
sure
very
smooth
for
high
abv
really
fresh
on
draft
def
would
drink
again
a
grand
mouth
feeling
had
one
while
i
watched
the
chinese
acrobats
at
the
lakeland
center
with
the
sumners
m
quite
full
bodied
finishes
bittersweet
mouth
feel
is
wonderful
under
tongue
bitter
carbonation
indicative
of
belgium
ales
pours
amber
with
two
finger
white
head
nose
is
hoppy
banana
bread
definitely
belgian
yeast
flavor
is
quite
unique
some
fruity
banana
hops
and
melon
followed
by
a
citrus
finish
it
is
growing
on
me
with
each
sip
mediumfull
body
moderate
carbonation
i
liked
this
more
than
i
expected
le
freak
pours
a
golden
bronze
color
with
a
nice
long
lasting
head
there
is
a
strong
spicy
aroma
very
hoppy
and
strong
belgian
candy
notes
the
taste
has
some
big
sweet
belgian
candy
flavors
with
a
harsh
bitter
hoppy
finish
good
feel
nice
body
overall
it
is
as
advertised
a
belgian
ipa
mixed
with
iipa
the
only
problem
is
the
iipa
flavor
is
a
bit
odd
overpowering
and
tastes
a
bit
old
d
i
do
enjoy
getting
my
freak
on
amarillo
is
always
a
good
choice
pretty
solid
beer
that
hits
more
on
the
american
ipa
side
while
incorporating
that
belgian
yeast
remarkably
well
balanced
for
its
size
too
o
other
than
some
off
smells
in
the
beginning
this
pans
out
to
be
a
decent
brew
an
interesting
mix
and
worth
a
go
tap
pours
clear
orange
with
white
head
aroma
of
hops
citrus
and
grass
tastes
of
bitter
hops
and
citrus
bitter
aftertaste
very
good
this
was
a
really
good
belgian
ipa
almost
made
me
understand
why
the
style
is
thus
named
there
were
nice
yeast
and
malt
notes
like
a
good
belgian
ale
sweet
and
alcohol
very
present
but
at
the
same
time
the
hops
just
punched
your
tongue
i
really
liked
this
id
have
it
again
any
day
though
it
is
for
sipping
slowly
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
crisp
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
that
i
am
sure
i
will
enjoy
again
o
nice
blend
that
would
be
nice
in
a
four
pack
hazy
amber
pour
with
an
ample
head
clove
taste
comes
out
fairly
strong
in
the
beginning
but
tapers
off
through
the
drink
and
warming
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
my
taste
fruitiness
is
very
strong
but
not
over
powering
not
sure
i
would
get
it
again
but
still
enjoyed
it
very
unique
all
the
fruitiness
of
belgian
ale
with
lots
of
clove
banana
and
maltiness
goodness
work
in
the
nice
hoppy
finish
that
one
would
expect
from
west
coat
friends
the
finish
also
lets
through
the
banana
bread
taste
as
well
after
thought
of
the
combination
of
two
great
types
of
beers
makes
this
one
of
my
recent
favorites
very
exciting
new
type
of
beer
for
me
o
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
style
in
general
i
dont
find
belgian
yeasts
really
complement
higher
hopping
that
well
one
note
of
caution
for
me
though
is
that
i
had
this
at
a
place
where
the
beer
sometimes
has
a
funny
taste
to
it
so
i
might
have
to
grab
a
bottle
of
this
sometime
to
compare
d
really
cool
beer
definitely
closer
to
the
tripel
side
than
the
ipa
side
but
nice
showing
by
both
aspects
of
the
brew
good
beer
and
this
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
o
highly
recommended
if
you
like
this
style
green
flash
nails
it
i
have
had
34
different
belgian
ipas
and
this
is
definitely
the
best
ive
had
thus
far
overall
this
is
a
pretty
standard
dipa
brewed
with
a
good
but
not
exceptional
tripel
yeast
it
could
be
better
sure
but
the
hops
and
the
yeast
combine
to
give
this
thing
an
extraordinary
balance
its
deceptively
drinkable
and
relatively
refreshing
for
such
a
high
gravity
beer
drink
this
mmm
mmm
good
i
love
this
smooth
baby
i
usually
get
it
bottled
and
cant
remember
if
ive
had
it
on
tap
ive
only
see
it
in
bombers
so
far
nice
little
treat
to
have
on
occasion
ive
run
out
of
things
to
write
but
i
have
to
reach
200
characters
ooverall
was
a
great
blend
of
my
two
favorite
styles
not
hoppy
poured
from
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
a
cloudy
dull
orange
brew
with
an
odd
head
a
matrix
of
small
bubbles
surrounded
by
a
sleeve
of
much
larger
bubbles
fairly
good
head
retention
aroma
is
bright
and
fruity
very
citrusforward
fresh
orange
juice
with
a
decent
blast
of
sweet
yeast
and
belgian
clovelike
spice
apple
cotton
candy
palate
is
a
very
close
split
between
belgian
tripel
and
american
ipa
as
advertised
often
a
take
on
this
style
will
skew
decidedly
one
way
or
the
other
but
this
exemplar
really
does
try
to
meld
the
two
in
equal
measure
very
bitter
hop
finish
and
tons
of
citrus
hop
flavor
orange
and
grapefruit
rind
and
flesh
plus
a
tinge
of
tropical
nectar
for
good
measure
mango
and
melon
also
getting
a
pungent
spice
like
equal
measures
of
clove
and
cumin
black
pepper
and
cardamom
faint
butterscotch
and
banana
chipspeel
a
whiff
of
bandagelike
phenols
rather
spicy
and
pungent
at
first
but
softens
over
time
to
reveal
a
fruit
cocktail
sweetness
that
begins
to
dominate
the
proceedings
late
quite
fizzy
and
theres
a
little
booze
in
the
finish
i
dig
the
whole
laundry
list
of
flavors
to
find
in
here
and
one
can
telescope
in
and
out
to
alternate
between
citrus
hops
and
belgian
spice
for
all
the
shit
green
flash
gets
for
various
reasons
beyond
the
scope
of
this
review
they
produce
worldclass
ipas
and
rather
solid
belgians
as
well
and
here
is
where
they
meet
cheers
o
this
is
a
big
complex
malt
monster
in
my
sample
the
belgian
heritage
is
obvious
and
delicious
if
it
was
intended
to
have
imperial
ipa
character
the
aroma
is
way
too
muted
but
that
is
probably
due
to
an
aged
example
serving
type
bottle
what
i
identify
in
my
more
memorable
belgian
pale
ales
and
belgian
strong
pale
ales
and
which
i
dont
get
here
is
that
bananataffy
flavor
and
aroma
i
think
that
might
be
what
some
reviewers
call
a
tropical
fruit
flavor
wish
i
knew
what
gives
a
belgian
that
odd
banana
sweetness
time
for
research
mode
overall
an
excellent
beer
very
different
it
combines
the
best
elements
of
a
trippel
and
a
dipa
hops
bitterness
spice
clove
and
lighter
fruit
overall
again
this
is
not
necessarily
what
one
would
think
of
when
the
term
belgian
ipa
is
bandied
about
this
is
a
tripel
souped
up
with
west
coast
dry
hopping
excellent
i
need
a
fresher
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
golden
amber
with
fluffy
white
foam
with
better
than
average
lacing
floral
hop
and
bubblegum
predominate
the
nose
with
some
herbaceous
earthy
spice
coming
in
at
the
end
floral
slightly
bitter
grassy
hops
start
leading
into
traditional
belgian
spice
and
yeast
with
clove
and
bubble
gum
flavors
slightly
sticky
on
the
palate
with
a
peppery
drying
finish
and
slightly
tinny
aftertaste
this
will
be
a
go
to
this
spring
overall
im
finally
getting
to
review
this
beer
after
drinkin
it
on
many
occasions
one
of
my
if
not
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
super
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
overall
a
very
well
put
together
belgian
ipa
that
nicely
balances
the
hop
notes
with
the
yeast
esters
alcohol
is
wellhidden
as
well
definitely
one
to
pick
up
medium
to
heavy
body
with
a
noticeable
fusel
alcohol
heat
firm
where
needed
and
yielding
when
called
for
i
stand
corrected
and
bring
me
another
o
i
have
been
nothing
but
impressed
with
green
flash
so
far
i
have
rated
others
of
their
beers
very
high
and
this
is
no
different
for
a
belgian
triple
american
imperial
ipa
this
goes
in
the
must
try
category
delicious
o
interesting
hybrid
bitterness
isnt
over
the
top
but
more
so
than
in
a
dubbel
but
the
belgian
spice
is
also
subdued
the
two
styles
seem
to
mild
each
other
out
it
was
enjoyable
drinking
this
from
the
first
sip
nothing
that
really
stood
out
for
me
a
solid
beer
but
just
not
my
style
o
not
a
typical
belgian
not
a
typical
ipa
but
green
flash
puts
its
own
stamp
on
the
style
and
blew
me
away
with
its
appearance
taste
and
mouthfeel
not
as
aromatic
as
i
would
have
expected
but
still
a
very
strong
beer
very
nice
mouthfeel
adds
to
my
admiration
of
le
freak
im
enjoying
it
while
hardly
my
favourite
style
this
at
least
comes
off
as
a
pleasantly
capable
version
the
belgian
yeast
and
yankee
hop
astringency
playing
together
nicely
enough
the
experience
softens
as
things
move
along
which
may
have
more
to
do
with
the
well
elevated
and
integrated
abv
than
anything
flavour
oriented
while
this
was
a
hybrid
its
like
4
parts
ipa
and
1
part
trippel
the
ipa
pieces
mask
a
lot
of
the
trippel
pieces
but
the
trippel
pieces
are
pretty
special
while
you
notice
them
its
a
good
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
even
with
high
abv
is
very
approachable
o
when
done
correctly
i
love
belgian
ipas
and
this
is
a
great
blend
of
two
styles
one
of
the
best
everyday
belgian
ipas
out
there
o
alcohol
pretty
well
restrained
great
beer
but
id
have
enjoyed
it
more
without

this

all
around
awesome

and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
sip
on
for
the
big
abv
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
a
mix
of
styles
clearly
a
tripel
hopturbinated
the
american
way
but
this
is
a
belgian
ipa
right
a
style
that
i
believe
is
hard
to
get
it
right
drinkability
not
so
high
given
its
sweetness
it
is
a
big
bottle
though
overall
a
really
good
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
good
taste
of
yeast
fruits
and
juicy
hops
appearance
is
pale
gold
with
fluffy
white
head
which
leave
loads
of
lacing
and
has
nice
retention
tons
of
cascading
bubbles
as
the
beer
sits
in
the
glass
nose
starts
with
heavy
belgo
yeast
which
brings
some
bubblegum
and
clove
hops
come
through
with
notes
of
earth
grass
and
a
touch
if
booziness
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
belgian
notes
which
bring
some
sweetness
and
spice
to
the
table
hops
are
next
and
while
they
are
very
present
they
dont
bring
much
bitterness
to
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
very
bubbly
with
medium
body
overall
this
is
exactly
as
billed
a
hoppy
triple
not
my
favorite
style
but
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
a
must
try
drink
it
serving
type
bottle
tripel
with
hops
love
the
idea
end
result
is
a
good
beer
cant
see
this
accelerating
into
a
trend
but
id
love
to
see
the
concept
run
up
the
flagpole
again
so
yeah
thats
all
ive
got
to
say
what
do
they
say
an
out
of
the
box
modern
ale
crafted
by
converging
two
beer
styles
belgian
trippel
sic
and
american
imperial
ipa
dryhopped
and
bottleconditionedits
a
zesty
brew
with
enticing
american
hops
and
fruity
belgian
yeast
aromatics
signed
i
cant
read
his
signature
brewmaster
o
an
interesting
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
its
definitely
one
you
need
to
sit
down
sip
and
enjoy
to
detect
all
of
its
nuances
great
job
by
green
flash
o
this
is
a
style
that
i
dont
try
very
often
i
usually
find
the
blend
of
tastes
offputting
or
forced
this
one
is
really
not
bad
dont
really
know
if
id
have
it
again
but
its
pretty
tasty
the
belgian
yeast
goes
remarkably
well
with
the
west
coast
hop
levels
just
too
bitter
for
my
personal
tastes
but
still
a
great
beer
and
see
how
this
could
appeal
to
many
beer
geeks
pretty
tasty
belgian
ipa
hybrid
the
belgian
elements
are
obvious
as
is
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
overall
comes
across
as
a
very
bitter
tripel
as
the
yeast
is
the
driving
factor
and
the
hops
taste
a
little
more
continental
than
american
to
me
very
enjoyable
overall
has
that
smell
and
tatse
of
a
belgium
beer
plus
the
hoppy
effect
of
an
american
ipa
le
freak
poured
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
that
reflected
its
bottle
conditioning
the
aroma
was
big
and
fruity
with
a
fresh
hop
nose
and
belgian
yeast
undertones
the
taste
started
lightly
sweet
and
fruity
and
melded
into
a
slightly
bitter
citrus
hop
flavor
that
was
expertly
nuanced
and
balanced
the
best
flavors
and
profiles
of
the
trippel
and
imperial
ipa
blended
exceptionally
and
continued
to
pull
me
back
in
for
sip
after
sip
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
medium
rocky
offwhite
head
aromas
of
freshly
cut
granny
smith
apples
and
a
tiny
hint
of
bandaid
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
apricot
flavor
followed
by
some
sharp
herbal
medicinal
tastes
then
finishing
with
a
grapefruit
and
asprin
finish
mouthfeel
is
quite
rich
overall
a
very
good
bipa
its
a
good
beer
though
the
yeast
character
is
a
bit
much
for
me
however
for
those
really
going
after
belgian
ipas
this
is
up
there
really
enjoyed
the
combination
of
the
styles
well
done
overall
this
brew
is
pretty
plain
for
something
that
is
called
le
freak
it
does
taste
as
advertised
a
cross
between
a
trippel
and
an
ipa
more
trippel
than
ipa
o
impressive
still
not
completely
onboard
with
belgian
strains
of
yeast
but
this
is
a
good
starting
point
o
can
definately
tell
that
this
beer
has
degraded
a
lot
but
its
still
a
solid
drink
overall
very
nice
beer
i
will
definitely
pick
up
some
more
in
the
future
o
this
is
a
new
favorite
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
belgians
or
belgianipas
because
of
the
yeast
flavor
profiles
but
the
strong
hops
and
dry
hopping
counterbalance
this
perfectly
i
will
definitely
be
enjoying
this
again
atmosphere
is
really
good
nice
head
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
bready
with
some
strong
hops
and
italian
spice
hoppy
yet
yeasty
with
spice
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
mike
hess
glass
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
the
trippel
part
of
this
brew
really
stands
out
in
the
smell
way
more
so
than
the
ipa
part
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
balanced
between
an
ipa
and
a
trippel
though
just
a
hint
of
pine
and
loads
of
citrus
and
bitterness
with
that
belgian
yeast
taste
to
sort
of
soften
the
blow
of
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
just
below
average
id
say
carbonation
was
maybe
a
bit
low
i
like
an
ipa
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
basically
what
youd
get
if
you
took
half
gf
iipa
and
half
gf
trippel
now
i
enjoyed
gf
trippel
but
it
really
wasnt
as
good
as
i
expected
and
gf
iipa
is
of
course
amazing
but
the
two
together
are
just
so
unique
it
brings
a
smile
to
my
face
this
is
exactly
what
gf
trippel
was
missing
overall
solid
solid
brew
green
flash
is
great
at
blending
and
interpreting
styles
definitely
recommend
trying
this
one
poured
a
golden
orange
body
with
good
head
and
moderate
lacing
thanks
to
active
carbonation
on
top
of
a
bountiful
aroma
of
citric
and
grape
like
hops
that
mix
not
overpower
with
belgian
yeast
and
some
sweet
candi
sugar
malt
and
orange
peel
as
well
this
beer
is
smooth
not
too
spicy
or
bitter
or
anything
that
may
have
gone
wrong
with
combining
western
style
hops
with
a
belgian
ipa
i
find
the
balancing
act
a
succesful
one
as
there
is
some
sweetness
in
this
beer
both
malty
candi
sugar
caramel
i
think
and
touches
of
tropical
fruit
tangerine
comes
to
mind
for
some
reason
as
does
apricot
but
also
a
spicy
strong
hop
presence
more
orange
citric
touches
of
grape
finishes
with
crisp
bite
and
alcohol
is
well
contained
overall
a
pretty
good
and
interesting
beer
and
not
too
many
like
this
one
are
around
o
this
is
one
of
the
combination
beers
that
actually
works
complex
flavors
and
aromas
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
beer
but
for
the
offputting
aftertaste
of
plastic
the
aroma
and
other
flavors
were
very
good
o
very
awesome
and
very
belgium
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
much
better
than
the
band
of
the
same
name
overall
initially
i
was
very
excited
by
the
looks
and
aroma
of
the
beer
but
in
the
end
i
think
that
theres
just
too
much
packed
into
here
i
feel
it
would
be
better
with
an
alcohol
content
in
the
67
range
or
even
lower
as
then
there
would
be
some
nice
thirstquenching
potential
given
the
citruslike
flavours
and
aromas
still
its
a
good
beer
and
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
o
it
scores
100
based
on
pure
uniqueness
and
the
brewers
ball
size
of
even
attempting
to
pull
off
a
belgian
style
ipa
with
a
tripel
lol
this
is
what
i
love
about
green
flash
the
have
the
imagination
to
attempt
something
like
this
yet
the
class
to
pull
it
off
a
pretty
refreshing
belgian
ipa
something
ill
buy
again
no
doubt
o
im
left
wondering
whether
i
got
all
that
i
paid
for
i
know
that
green
flash
started
bottledating
recently
but
its
possible
that
the
light
yellow
ink
had
been
rubbed
off
which
is
frustrating
now
i
dont
think
every
brewer
should
make
their
beers
like
stone
with
the
enjoy
by
date
in
huge
letters
on
the
label
but
it
wouldnt
hurt
to
date
bottles
in
a
manner
that
couldnt
be
sabotaged
by
any
bottle
shop
employee
with
a
wet
rag
and
a
desire
to
sell
old
beer
at
any
rate
this
is
a
beer
that
did
pretty
well
with
a
little
age
on
it
though
i
wished
it
were
fresher
im
glad
i
got
to
try
because
it
was
an
excellent
belgoamerican
ale
had
on
tap
at
the
sierra
grille
beverage
had
a
great
and
orangecopper
appearance
with
a
rich
frothy
head
aromas
included
smells
of
yeast
and
hops
wish
i
could
have
pinpointed
the
fruit
aroma
i
smelled
but
there
was
a
nice
ripe
fruit
aroma
to
the
drink
taste
was
a
good
mix
of
fruits
and
hops
i
felt
like
i
could
taste
a
flavor
of
pineapple
and
bready
hops
good
mouthful
of
a
medium
carbonation
that
helps
the
flavors
come
out
without
being
muted
overall
a
pretty
good
drink
never
tried
too
many
belgian
ipas
but
this
definitely
makes
me
want
to
try
more
d
quite
a
tasty
beverage
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
funkier
but
enjoyable
o
this
mix
of
styles
was
better
than
expected
and
is
done
well
enough
that
they
dont
just
clash
still
it
lacks
the
fine
amalgamation
found
in
for
instance
a
chouffe
belgian
ipa
7
610
a
very
complex
mix
of
flavors
awesome
belgian
yeast
with
good
use
of
hops
this
packs
a
punch
in
all
ways
but
keeps
its
balance
very
nice
oa
very
complex
brew
combining
a
belgian
trippel
and
a
dipa
was
a
fantastic
idea
as
the
flavors
blend
perfectly
in
le
freak
everything
is
mixed
well
but
no
typical
notes
of
the
two
styles
were
too
subtle
exceptional
brew
nonetheless
i
like
my
beer
like
my
women
this
one
is
just
throws
itself
onto
you
and
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
discovering
involved
served
in
a
tulip
ontap
at
big
orange
on
410
pours
a
golden
amber
almost
burnished
bronze
color
it
was
fairly
cloudy
but
it
did
allow
some
light
penetration
there
is
a
half
centimeter
of
bright
white
head
moderate
lacing
the
smell
is
very
fragrant
with
decend
bready
malt
and
fruity
belgian
yeast
of
melons
like
some
tasty
honeydew
there
is
a
slight
resinous
hop
that
sneaks
through
as
well
the
taste
is
a
tasty
belgian
brew
with
strong
bittering
throughout
there
is
a
sweet
tangy
flavor
as
well
but
not
quite
sour
very
much
like
fresh
ripe
cherries
there
is
a
bit
of
a
champagne
flavor
to
it
as
well
at
the
end
the
finish
is
heavy
on
the
bitter
and
finishes
extremely
dry
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
so
i
had
another
overall
i
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
because
i
first
heard
of
it
a
week
ago
thought
it
sounded
very
interesting
and
just
happened
across
it
this
weekend
it
is
very
tasty
and
very
unique
so
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
despite
being
a
bit
pricey
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
out
very
often
due
to
the
price
tag
but
this
has
definitely
sparked
my
interest
in
belgian
ipas
if
other
examples
of
the
style
are
as
complex
and
unique
as
this
then
i
am
in
for
a
fun
ride
o
a
bit
uneven
but
the
taste
is
too
die
for
o
not
as
balanced
as
i
like
undercarbonated
i
quite
like
its
not
a
great
beer
carbonation
could
be
a
bit
higher
not
exactly
a
dud
but
not
all
that
impressive
to
me
somehow
the
hops
dont
come
through
and
where
they
do
its
to
the
detriment
of
the
beer
think
i
would
have
like
it
better
as
a
straight
belgian
ale
overall
fantastic
belgian
ipa
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
stone
calibelgique
albeit
with
a
significantly
stronger
abv
at
twice
the
price
though
id
opt
for
the
stone
more
often
than
not
o
i
actually
liked
the
beer
for
a
couple
of
reasons
and
didnt
like
it
for
a
couple
also
liked
9
2
abv
gave
me
a
goodbeerbuzz
was
disappointed
when
the
bottle
was
empty
which
happened
before
i
realized
not
liked
price
the
most
i
ever
paid
for
a
4
pack
14
00
a
little
too
much
the
belgian
yeast
was
a
little
too
strong
for
the
mix
i
desire
a
more
freshhoppy
flavor
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
is
a
nice
bipa
in
the
sense
that
it
showcases
some
bright
hops
and
also
some
belgian
yeast
but
maintains
balance
the
alcohol
is
also
relatively
well
hidden
adding
only
a
slight
warmth
in
the
finish
and
some
body
this
is
a
bipa
that
i
could
sip
on
for
a
while
i
like
the
balance
and
the
flavor
profile
it
was
enjoyable
throughout
overall
drinkable
but
a
far
cry
from
a
top
choice
we
hold
out
for
brews
that
are
at
least
a
7
on
our
scale
cheers
o
poorly
executed
i
dont
think
this
is
a
bad
bottle
it
doesnt
taste
infected
it
just
tastes
like
a
poorly
brewed
beer
i
have
had
way
better
examples
of
a
belgian
style
ipa
this
is
very
one
dimensional
bitter
and
alcohol
i
expected
much
more
distinct
flavor
and
a
much
more
enjoyable
beer
i
feel
there
is
some
good
favors
deep
down
but
they
are
not
coming
through
not
a
drain
pour
i
can
drink
it
but
wont
buy
another
o
a
nice
mix
belgian
then
tons
of
west
coast
hoppy
ipa
rjt
o
not
something
i
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
session
but
very
tasty
nonetheless
my
reference
belgianstyle
ipa
is
bedlam
this
stuff
is
pretty
close
overall
a
very
nice
offering
o
one
hell
of
an
interesting
combo
here
trippel
takes
the
cake
as
far
as
the
blend
goes
but
the
hops
are
sneaky
and
tasty
too
o
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
deliciously
drinkable
not
much
i
didnt
like
here
has
a
big
diverse
body
and
combines
the
great
flavors
of
a
trippel
and
an
ipa
looking
forward
to
having
many
more
of
these
wonderful
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
really
more
like
a
true
belgian
tripel
with
loads
of
american
hops
added
typically
this
style
just
has
the
belgian
yeast
but
this
one
adds
the
sweetness
and
maltcandi
sugar
flavors
that
are
found
in
tripels
a
very
tasty
beer
that
stands
out
for
the
style
appearance
is
a
little
murky
as
i
poured
into
a
wine
glass
and
there
was
active
yeast
still
bubbling
away
in
the
glass
drank
it
at
temperature
in
the
4550
degree
range
which
was
just
right
smell
and
taste
are
a
perfect
match
in
this
beer
as
the
very
hop
flavor
you
anticipate
is
what
you
get
no
other
off
flavors
to
surprise
fantastic
job
once
again
from
the
people
at
green
flash
if
this
werent
such
a
hybrid
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
tripelstyled
beers
in
america
however
the
better
news
that
because
its
a
hybrid
recipe
its
a
beer
thats
unlike
any
other
ive
ever
had
excellent
stuff
and
will
definitely
buy
more
in
the
future
o
nice
belgian
pale
with
hoppy
twist
very
good
there
is
at
least
1
of
white
foam
against
an
hazy
golden
orange
color
in
my
clear
glass
the
smell
of
spices
fruit
and
mild
pine
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
of
cloves
banana
and
alcoholic
fruit
put
a
surprising
finish
to
the
zesty
brew
this
has
a
great
balance
of
components
in
on
12
fl
oz
bottle
this
is
a
1
brew
from
green
flash
ill
be
back
for
more
o
my
first
beer
from
green
flash
i
really
like
this
one
its
an
amazing
blend
of
the
two
styles
refreshing
complex
and
well
balanced
addendum
as
beer
gets
a
little
warmer
the
tartness
fades
and
the
sweetness
from
the
grain
expresses
itself
making
it
a
little
more
appealing
pours
hazy
golden
with
huge
frothy
head
aroma
is
a
nice
combination
of
belgian
yeast
citrus
hops
and
some
peachpearapple
light
fruit
mix
both
the
trippel
and
the
pale
flavors
are
apparent
here
a
nice
blend
very
sweet
light
fruit
up
front
with
some
bitterness
on
the
way
down
that
lingers
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
on
the
back
end
medium
mouthfeel
nice
beer
overall
this
is
tasty
it
has
a
nice
hit
of
hops
for
a
belgian
style
beer
overall
the
belgian
flavor
is
the
dominant
one
so
only
get
this
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
that
but
its
a
nice
taste
that
mixes
well
with
the
hops
and
it
is
definitely
gulpable
also
it
is
shockingly
nonboozy
for
being
9
2
making
it
a
great
beer
to
get
a
buzz
from
le
freak

reemerging
booze
note
o
solid
belgian
ipa
like
the
orangecitrus
thing
like
the
way
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
could
be
a
bit
more
belgiany
the
yeast
is
more
prominent
in
the
nose
than
in
the
taste
o
solid
beer
that
is
big
on
aroma
and
taste
very
impressive
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
o
another
solid
beer
from
green
flash
they
impress
me
in
a
variety
of
styles
perhaps
none
better
than
their
belgian
offerings
this
one
has
big
belgian
flavors
improved
upon
by
the
hop
additions
a
little
bit
more
expensive
than
i
would
like
but
a
very
solid
beer
i
will
probably
get
again
m
thick
this
is
one
big
ipa
very
full
body
and
subdued
carbonation
i
could
actually
stand
for
a
bit
more
here
finish
is
not
dry
but
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
either
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
combining
american
double
ipa
and
belgian
trippel
o
overall
i
think
it
is
over
hopped
and
the
bitterness
detracts
from
anything
interesting
that
the
yeast
is
doing
for
it
its
good
but
its
hard
to
see
this
as
anything
but
an
overhopped
beer
pours
a
clear
very
slightly
hazy
golden
with
not
much
head
action
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
autumnal
fruit
and
an
almost
barbecued
pork
smell
slightly
offputting
but
intriguing
but
then
bam
the
first
taste
is
a
chewy
thanksgiving
stuffing
savory
belgian
nougat
and
then
the
citrusy
resiny
hops
kick
in
midpalate
i
find
the
combination
to
work
very
wellmanages
to
combine
the
two
styles
in
a
way
that
both
stand
out
equally
and
neither
cancels
the
other
out
way
better
than
stones

best

from
the
oned
ive
had
o
in

aspects
this
is
the
king
of
belgian
ipas
all
of
the
key
factors
are
there
intense
fruity
bitterness
from
the
hops
rich
somewhat
chalky
yeast
character
complimentary
malt
body
vibrant

truly
a
worldclass
beer
o
seems
a
little
more
belgian
than
ipa
usually
not
a
fan
of
belgian
ipas
but
i
would
come
back
to
this
one
green
flash
never
fails
to
impress
most
definitely
a
tongue
ripper
as
far
as
bitterness
and
boozy
character
goes
yet
it
does
have
its
appeal
based
solely
on
my
first
review
the
second
tasting
is
much
more
balanced
yet
just
as
ripping
as
ever
and
thats
a
good
thing
second
opinions
and
tries
certainly
can
paint
a
new
or
different
picture
of
things
in
this
case
im
much
more
pleased
and
impressed
with
this
second
goaround
overall
another
winner
from
green
flash
one
of
my
favourite
brewers
while
this
beer
does
have
a
lot
of
vibrant
flavours
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
punch
i
guess
that
makes
it
more
drinkable
however
the
booze
is
very
well
hidden
medium
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
balanced
out
somewhat
by
pepper
this
is
a
nice
belgian
ipa
which
i
would
gladly
buy
again
o
i
love
this
west
coast
belgian
it
combines
my
favorite
element
of
each
in
an
assertive
yet
balanced
beer
itll
make
hop
head
somewhat
happy
just
dont
except
a
total
hop
bomb
great
beer
with
lots
going
on
funky
and
just
works
daring
to
combine
a
trippel
with
an
ipa
and
it
comes
up
a
winner
two
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
cloudy
orange
with
golden
hues
body
grapefruit
citrus
hops
light
pine
resin
caramel
malts
breads
herbal
hops
and
standard
belgian
yeast
flavor
follows
very
nicely
with
excellent
belgian
character
in
the
yeast
with
your
prototypical
mix
of
herbal
earthy
and
citrus
hops
for
the
style
pineapple
and
orange
peel
for
citrus
hops
this
one
is
overly
carbonated
though
and
medium
in
body
overall
a
great
representation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
even
though
it
is
supposed
to
be
an
american
ipa
and
trippel
hybrid
of
sorts
o
so
unusual
but
so
good
the
combination
of
a
belgian
trippel
and
an
ipa
is
daring
yet
tasty
o
green
flashs
version
of
marrying
belgian
and
california
style
brews
a
brew
which
at
first
may
confuse
and
overwhelm
the
palate
but
remains
interesting
exploring
new
flavor
combinations
and
creating
a
style
of
its
own
although
a
brew
with
good
ideas
it
is
far
from
perfect
and
i
am
interested
to
see
how
california
breweries
build
on
this
style
of
belgian
west
coast
blends
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
it
is
just
too
hot
and
spicy
right
now
needs
some
serious
time
to
mellow
out
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
o
a
fantastic
beer
a
great
take
on
combining
the
best
of
a
triple
with
an
ipa
notes
the
hop
flavor
was
big
and
bold
which
made
for
a
very
interesting
beer
this
is
exceptional
and
very
different
it
pours
hazy
glowing
blonde
with
a
tall
and
delicate
white
head
with
great
retention
smells
like
a
hop
bomb
which
is
to
be
expected
with
green
flash
beers
there
is
also
some
really
spicy
belgian
yeast
in
the
nose
thats
got
some
peppery
funk
to
it
the
flavor
is
deep
it
starts
off
like
a
big
sappy
ipa
with
oozing
citrus
hops
and
an
alcohol
sting
it
is
quickly
mellowed
and
enhanced
at
the
same
time
by
the
yeast
which
rounds
out
the
hops
into
a
full
meal
of
flavors
a
lot
of
stuff
dances
around
the
mouth
but
the
hops
just
keep
coming
back
this
is
a
monster
of
a
beer
fresh
as
can
be
feel
is
good
bright
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
thats
made
heavier
by
the
sticky
hop
quality
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
share
totally
unique
and
very
strong
paired
will
with
some
ash
cured
goats
cheese
and
spicy
nuts
give
it
a
try
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
traditional
belgian
ipa
brewed
overseas
than
some
americanized
interpretations
the
hops
dont
shine
like
with
sumpin
wild
and
raging
bitch
so
if
you
like
belgian
ipas
with
balance
this
is
great
if
youre
looking
for
a
hop
flavor
forward
belgian
ipa
this
might
not
do
the
trick
either
way
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
overall
this
was
different
and
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
delicious
belgian
ipa
that
stands
out
in
a
field
of
clones
as
this
genre
becomes
more
popular
there
are
plenty
of
halfassed
attempts
out
there
this
is
not
one
of
them
o
i
really
like
the
attempt
at
the
hybrid
style
but
it
just
finishes
too
bitter
for
me
the
bitterness
really
detracts
from
wanting
to
take
another
sip
regardless
of
how
complex
this
beer
might
or
could
be
just
a
little
too
muddled
for
my
taste
o
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
however
im
still
finding
my
bearings
on
the
belgian
ipa
style
yes
this
is
good
im
pretty
sure
id
have
this
again
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
brew
that
is
well
worth
the
price

a
slightly
murky
honey

foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to

of
the
beer

foamy
curtain

lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and

taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
very
yeasty
flavor
and
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
it
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
you
get
the
greatness
from
being
an
ipa
with
the
extra
hoppiness
finished
with
the
malty
belgian
taste
i
wasnt
sure
about
this
beer
but
i
try
almost
everything
greenflash
puts
out
this
one
is
excellent
and
definitely
something
i
will
drink
again
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
there
is
a
delicate
sort
of
balance
about
it
between
very
intense
hoppiness
and
traditional
belgian
malts
and
yeastiness
i
will
definitely
be
picking
this
one
up
again
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
very
interesting
and
goodtasting
mouth
feel
is
velvety
and
lovely
overall
i
think
this
one
is
a
repeater
its
not
easy
to
categorize
other
than
it
goes
in
the
category
of
i
like
it

body
is

large
lots
of

not
very
dry
for
the
style
and
very
drinkable
for
the
hefty
abv
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
style
that
i
am
starting
to
love
i
am
not
a
huge
belgian
fan
but
when
you
give
me
the
hop
fix
like
raging
bitch
smuttynose

le
freak
i
truly
enjoy
o
the
more
i
drink
from

the
more
i
love
them
this
is
a
fantastic
bipa

slightly
below

life
from
fff
super
easily
drinkable
for
a
9
abv
great
fresh
flavors
and
clean
finish
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
wish
i
could
find
a
22oz
bottle
green
flash
most
underrated
west
coast
brewery
o
pretty
smooth
with
an
interesting
mixture
of
flavors
but
it
isnt
a
worldbeater
good
mixture
of
flavors
overall
i
like
it
but
im
not
in
love
with
it
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
large
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
plenty
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
behind
as
the
head
dissipates
there
are
aromas
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
but
these
are
not
very
strong
there
are
sweet
malts
and
belgian
yeasts
having
just
had
a
tripel
i
can
see
where
this
is
an
ipa
meets
a
tripel
the
hops
are
forward
in
this
beer
but
not
like
they
are
in
typical
west
coast
hop
bombs
there
are
flavors
of
citrus
bready
malts
caramel
pine
and
good
belgian
yeast
it
tastes
like
the
perfect
marriage
of
a
belgian
tripel
and
an
american
ipa
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
good
carbonation
there
is
a
dry
finish
to
this
beer
and
this
is
highly
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
beer
green
flash
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
o
a
nicley
balanced
belgian
ipa
i
was
nervous
at
first
but
this
one
really
pulled
through
a
great
hybrid
of
two
styles
if
you
like
belgian
ipas
this
one
is
a
must
try
d
a
great
beer
overall
as
with
every
offering
from
green
flash
im
very
impressed
they
might
have
overtaken
founders
as
my
favorite
brewery
with
this
one
its
a
brewery
that
really
just
gets
it
drinking
a
beer
from
green
flash
is
like
watching
a
movie
from
your
favorite
director
where
the
director
is
on
point
with
his
usual
familiar
aesthetic
where
he
is
expert
and
where
everything
is
exceptionally
bold
but
never
overdone
i
recommend
anyone
with
similar
affinities
to
try
green
flashs
rayon
vert
its
like
no
other
beer
ive
ever
encountered
overall
havent
had
a
belgian
ipa
in
some
time
and
this
one
was
a
great
find
the
9
2
abv
is
an
afterthought
with
this
one
very
drinkable
after
a
long
day
at
the
office
definitely
recommend
and
will
pick
up
this
and
more
green
flash
brews
now
that
they
are
available
in
atl
good
stuff
o
really
glad
that
this
finally
made
its
way
to
ny
ill
definately
be
picking
up
a
few
more
4packs
of
this
one
great
complexity
tons
of
flavor
and
goes
with
so
many
different
foods
overall
a
good
offering
by
gf
to
the
bipa
style
super
hops
up
front
that
leave
a
lingering
bitterness
but
the
beer
did
get
better
as
it
warmed
up
hops
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
or
just
add
a
bit
more
sweetnesswhich
in
turn
will
add
more
alcohol
to
the
beer
the
alcohol
is
veyr
well
hidden
too
enjoyed
this
beer
just
a
nice
hybrid
and
good
change
of
pace
would
definitely
try
it
again
fantasic
brew
here
love
this
take
on
belgian
ipa
great
beer
o
i
think
of
this
beer
as
one
of
the
best
dipas
ive
had
in
awhile
the
belgian
yeast
ads
some
complexity
and
the
cane
sugar
dries
it
out
what
are
you
waiting
for
go
get
your
freak
on
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
white
billowy
head
on
this
is
gigantic
atop
of
a
amber
body
that
had
cloudy
swirls
in
it
which
alarmed
me
at
first
since
im
unfamiliar
with
this
style
of
beer
the
hops
are
at
the
forefront
of
the
smell
the
hops
are
readily
apparent
in
the
taste
as
well
but
are
balanced
out
nicely
by
a
malt
flavor
for
how
high
the
alcohol
percentage
is
in
this
beer
it
hides
it
well
after
you
take
a
swig
youre
again
reminded
of
the
hops
in
the
aftertaste
theres
a
common
theme
here
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
great
thanks
to
the
balance
of
the
ingredients
truthfully
if
i
have
to
tell
someone
what
my
favorite
beer
is
ill
respond
with
this
one
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
the
intent
to
mix
a
tripel
with
an
imperial
ipa
is
achieved
quite
well
on
the
taste
if
not
so
well
on
the
nose
really
enjoyable
would
benefit
from
better
carbonation
and
improved
feel
o
to
me
this
was
like
a
double
ipa
with
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
finish
an
excellent
beer
overall
this
one
underwhelmed
me
not
enough
hops
imo
and
a
bit
to
sweet
i
feel
like
the
flavor
profiles
dont
come
together
in
the
end
drinkable
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
hell
i
didnt
even
buy
this
it
was
given
to
me
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
yelloworange
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
sweet
alcohol
fruit
wheat
fruit
hop
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
fruit
hop
wheat
spice
spicy
hop
earth
and
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
this
one
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
however
they
didnt
all
seem
to
work
together
in
my
opinion
but
rather
against
one
another
this
really
hurt
the
overall
brew
in
my
opinion
there
was
definitely
a
lot
of
spice
going
on
here
which
was
nice
blended
with
the
fruit
tones
but
the
alcohol
came
along
and
wrecked
it
all
too
bad
worth
trying
to
judge
for
yourself
overall
4
0
so
as
belgian
ipas
go
this
occupies
the
tripelbspa
dipa
hybrid
part
of
the
spectrum
which
is
a
pretty
solid
route
if
youre
crafting
a
belgian
ipa
others
are
basically
american
dipas
with
a
nominally
belgian
yeast
profile
and
others
are
basic
ipa
recipes
with
a
farmhouse
strain
this
beer
is
belgian
first
and
ipa
second
it
works
for
me
but
whether
or
not
you
dig
this
beer
depends
on
what
youre
looking
for
from
the
style
but
if
you
like
tripels
and
unfiltered
bspas
and
also
love
hops
then
this
is
your
beer
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
it
isnt
as
bombastically
hopped
as
a
lot
of
american
dipas
but
green
flash
has
crafted
a
really
excellent
brew
regardless
definitely
seek
this
out
and
thank
you
for
listening
to
my
pleas
for
le
freak
in
12oz
bottles
gf
this
is
full
bodied
with
very
lively
carbonation
this
isnt
terrible
but
the
yeast
flavor
isnt
great
and
the
hop
flavor
is
mostly
just
bitter
i
should
disclose
i
dont
love
this
style
in
general
o
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
definitely
serious
business
and
drinks
as
such
o
flavors
are
good
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
out
there
if
you
like
them
hop
heavy
overall
very
nice
interesting
combo
o
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
recommend
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
when
its
done
right
it
can
be
great
this
one
is
close
o
pretty
good
unique
this
was
one
of
the
first
craft
brews
that
i
tried
as
i
got
into
craft
beer
and
this
is
first
time
i
have
gotten
around
to
reviewing
it
it
is
as
good
as
i
remember
it
really
combines
the
aspects
of
the
ipa
and
tripel
quite
well
balancing
the
flavors
in
a
very
natural
way
o
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
overall
although
i
would
pick
a
belgian
yeast
strain
with
less
tart
and
more
fruity
esters
to
go
with
the
hops
and
evident
alcohol
fruit
character
o
this
is
a
very
solid
ale
the
brewery
bills
it
as
a
combination
of
an
ipa
and
a
tripel
and
i
think
that
description
is
apt
combining
the
hoppiness
of
an
american
ipa
with
the
delicate
malt
and
yeast
balance
of
a
belgian
tripel
this
is
one
seriously
complex
interesting
ale
nicely
done
green
flash
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
very
quenching
and
easy
to
drink
beer
not
much
indication
at
all
of
the
relatively
high
abv
recommended
a
surprising
and
intriguing
beer
admittedly
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
socalled
belgian
ipas
but
i
enjoyed
this
its
not
something
id
want
to
session
all
night
but
as
a
stand
alone
bottle
i
dig
it
o
this
is
my
first
foray
into
belgian
ipas
tastes
similar
to
what
you
might
expect
like
a
belgian
ale
with
strong
hop
flavor
still
interesting
and
enjoyable
o
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
the
scent
is
really
quite
wonderful
but
i
feel
a
bit
like
the
wrong
notes
popped
out
in
the
taste
none
of
the
spiciness
from
the
nose
came
through
in
the
mouth
probably
a
one
time
shot
for
me
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
strange
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
while
and
i
quite
like
it
having
read
the
very
mixed
reviews
on
this
beer
it
looks
to
be
a
love
it
or
hate
it
type
and
i
can
definitively
tell
why
if
you
like
to
taste
something
different

so
often

original
review
10102010
this
beer
poured
a
golden
hazy
color
with
a
full
foam
head
the
aroma
was
that
of
floral
hoppiness
with
a
citrus
undertone
upon
my
first
sip
i
instantly
loved
this
beer
mild
hop
flavor
hidden
by
the
sweet
spiciness
of
the
triple
the
beer
finished
with
a
nice
hint
of
lemon
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
as
a
truly
wonderful
experience
o
a
damn
good
beer
a
trippel
mixed
with
a
double
ipa
nice
the
fresher
version
is
much
cleaner
but
has
a
lot
of
odd
tart
and
mixed
up
flavors
they
all
really
dont
blend
all
too
great
together
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
with
the
age
despite
it
feeling
a
little
heavier
due
to
the
sweeter
flavors
the
beer
gets
a
lot
more
complex
with
time
and
a
lot
of
great
fruit
flavors
are
aloud
to
come
out
the
hop
presence
and
the
belgian
influence
just
dont
seem
to
work
so
letting
the
beer
age
the
hop
flavors
out
is
kind
of
nice
none
the
less
i
wasnt
incredibly
impressed
with
this
beer
fresh
or
aged
fresh
was
just
too
all
over
the
place
despite
it
being
so
clean
aged
is
kind
of
nice
and
exhibits
some
unique
fruit
flavors
but
theyre
not
good
enough
to
store
away
the
beer
for
such
a
time
on
top
of
this
the
flavors
get
kind
of
muddied
and
you
can
find
cleaner
belgians
ready
to
drink
now
with
similar
qualities
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
very
tasty
and
refreshing
without
sacrificing
body
taste
or
aroma
this
is
a
top
notch
brew
i
wish
it
was
more
easily
accessible
because
i
would
keep
this
brew
stocked
from
march
to
october
for
sure

today
puts
a

sensation
in
your
chest
a
very
great
smelling
and
looking
beer
but
in
my
opinion
couldve
worked
a
little
better
with
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
o
more
ipa
than
belgian
i
felt
this
beer
definitely
improved
as
it
warmed
up
a
bit
probably
not
a
style
id
seek
out
often
but
i
was
glad
to
give
it
a
taste
slightly
watery
up
front
with
a
nearly
full
bodied
middle
and
finish
slight
dryness
with
some
abv
warming
presence
from
the
swallow
on
nice
brew
without
the
overkill
hops
of
the
standard
west
coast
breweries
although
the
ipa
part
seems
to
dominate
more
time
on
the
palate
of
my
mouth
i
really
enjoyed
the
overall
beer
will
drink
again
overall
this
was
quite
a
fantastic
beer
it
takes
some
of
the
best
features
of
each
beer
style
the
very
nice
yeastyspicybreadycreamy
feel
of
a
good
belgian
and
the
great
hop
flavor
of
a
nice
ipa
very
well
done
overall
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
i
tend
to
be
impressed
by
belgianstyle
ipas
which
are
based
on
tripels
and
le
freak
is
no
exception
id
definitely
have
this
again
really
good
brew
get
one
if
you
see
it
o
this
brew
is
unique
but
is
a
slight
miss
on
style
its
flavors
are
very
strong
and
at
times
quite
pleasant
however
once
in
a
while
bad
tings
come
out
its
recommended
but
id
let
it
sit
for
a
month
or
two
to
mellow
out
a
bit
what
a
tasty
freak
segueing
perfectly
from
the
big
creamy
tripel
character
into
the
dry
snappy
dipa
character
and
those
fruit
tones
are
absolutely
stellar
this
and
the
imperial
ipa
are
by
far
my
favorite
gfs
that
ive
tasted
but
this
may
just
have
the
edge
with
its
freakness
bottom
line
worth
a
try
d
not
bad
but
a
little
strange
and
disjointed
too
old
i
cant
be
for
sure
due
to
no
bottled
date
this
has
a
lot
of
the
imperial
ipa
character
with
the
malty
richness
and
huge
hops
very
bitter
aftertaste
overall
its
just
too
much
of
the
bitter
hops
but
the
yeasty
and
bacteria
flavors
are
quite
forward
on
the
coarse
side
and
quite
sharp

that

low
weight
of

mouthfeel
results
in
a
slightly
sluggish

finishes
dry
really
the
only
aspect
of
this
beer
i
wasnt
particularly
impressed
with
had
the
hop
character
been
present
in
the
aroma
i
wouldve
been
more
impressed
but
the
beer
is
a
solid
offering
with
the
flavor
profile
making
up
for
the
aroma
shortcomings
still
think
i
like
houblon
better
o
certainly
thought
this
beer
was
interesting
did
i
love
it
no
will
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
when
it
comes
down
to
it
i
prefer
wellcrafted
versions
of
either
of
the
two
styles
they
were
looking
to
combine
over
this
but
kudos
for
brewing
something
fun
and
different
o
not
sure
im
into
this
flavor
profile
great
smells
taste
is
a
bit
harsh
poured
this
belgian
ipa
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
produced
a
thick
off
white
creamy
head
excellent
head
retention
and
thick
rings
of
lacing
were
left
on
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
sourdough
yeasty
spices
cracked
pepper
citrus
lemon
peels
and
cloves
medium
in
body
this
belgian
ipa
had
a
base
of
malted
grain
a
melody
of
fruit
including
pears
granny
smith
apples
and
citrus
hops
this
ale
was
more
fruity
then
hoppy
not
bad
just
not
what
i
expected
the
bottle
says
that
is
a
mix
of
belgian
ale
and
an
american
imperial
ipa
i
just
dont
find
anything
imperial
about
this
ipa
overall
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
just
dont
go
into
it
thinking
your
getting
an
aggressive
hopped
ipa
you
will
be
disappointed
this
beer
failed
my
time
honored
ipa
test
i
give
my
wife
a
sip
and
if
her
face
doesnt
pucker
its
not
up
to
par
not
only
did
she
not
pucker
she
said
mmmm
this
one
is
good
ipa
fail
prost
oi
had
pretty
high
expectations
for
this
one
but
unfortunately
they
fell
short
nice
looking
beer
with
a
good
nose
but
something
didnt
quite
work
for
me
this
one
was
interesting
but
ultimately
a
bit
disappointing
i
guess
i
should
have
tried
this
first
in
my
sampling
because
the
rayon
vert
set
the
bar
too
high
ultimately
this
one
is
too
yeasty
and
pungent
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
again
to
be
honest
understand
that
this
is
only
because
gf
makes
better
beer
this
is
still
a
complex
interesting
belgian
inspired
ipa
o
very
enjoyable
belgian
ipa
noticeable
alcohol
takes
it
down
a
notch
crazy
fucking
beer
but
i
love
it
some
may
deride
projects
like
this
but
chances
are
theyre
too
closeminded
to
meet
le
freak
i
may
have
this
again
on
tap
if
i
see
it
but
no
luck
on
bottles
since
the
price
tag
is
around
10
50
and
thats
beyond
my
limit
what
you
have
here
is
basically
a
dipa
dialedup
with
belgian
yeast
and
you
know
what
le
freak
works
overall
a
must
in
trying
this
will
broaden
your
horizons
on
beer
styles
if
you
have
not
ventured
out
much
even
if
you
have
its
still
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
a
different
hybrid
compared
to
other
belgian
ipas
that
i
have
tried
this
one
just
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
same
balance
that
would
raise
it
above
the
bar
if
you
are
a
hardcore
green
flash
fan
and
love
their
over
the
top
hop
profiles
then
i
think
you
will
love
this
beer
but
for
me
i
found
it
to
be
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
seeking
out
again
appearance
is
light
orange
slightly
hazy
nice
cream
colored
head
its
nose
contains
apple
banana
clove
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
of
le
freak
has
some
malts
a
good
amount
of
hops
more
belgian
yeast
quite
a
bit
more
citrus
mf
is
pretty
dry
with
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
was
nice
to
try
this
beer
again
the
last
time
i
had
it
was
a
few
years
ago
and
at
that
time
from
a
bottle
that
could
have
been
past
its
prime
o
a
little
too
hyped
in
my
opinion
but
definitively
an
interesting
beer
appearance
wasnt
great
to
me
smell
was
adequate
taste
was
lacking
the
belgian
side
and
mouth
was
decent
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
or
recommend
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
a
bit
too
bitter
and
dry
i
like
to
see
it
with
more
hop
character
on
the
back
end
because
i
wasnt
really
picking
anything
up
there
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
sadly
no
freshness
date
this
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
massive
white
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
wonderful
a
nose
full
of
sweet
yeast
esters
banana
and
spices
along
with
a
little
hop
the
feel
is
medium
with
even
more
carbonation
the
taste
us
outstanding
first
is
a
bitter
mouthful
of
hops
followed
by
a
semi
sweet
taste
then
a
nice
bitter
after
taste
another
great
one
from
green
flash
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
some
nice
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
but
a
bit
tangy
and
too
sweet
for
me
not
something
id
probably
seek
out
again
glad
i
took
the
plunge
again
as
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
and
its
new
label
overall
im
not
a
big
fan
this
truly
is
freaky
and
i
recommend
trying
it
just
to
see
what
its
like
but
i
dont
think
bubblegum
and
cotton
candy
go
well
with
grassy
bitter
hops
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
head
is
very
creamy
but
dissipates
quickly
with
medium
carbonation
left
behind
smells
of
wheat
oranges
and
a
slight
twang
the
beer
begins
with
a
citrusy
taste
that
develops
into
a
sweet
maltiness
that
ends
with
a
slight
hop
bite
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
to
medium
the
drinkability
is
great
but
because
it
is
a
hefty
beer
not
thank
drinkable
overall
an
amazing
beer
especially
being
one
of
my
first
blends
for
a
beer
onot
bad
and
tasty
with
the
high
abv
very
well
hiddeninteresting
cheers
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
good
well
made
american
version
of
belgian
ipa
o
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
but
it
is
extremely
interesting
and
not
like
any
other
that
ive
had
or
at
least
can
remember
id
suggest
sharing
the
bottle
as
it
is
a
beast
of
an
experience
le
freak
is
an
apt
name
hazy
dirty
yellow
frothy
white
head
about
a
fingers
worth
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
right
up
front
spicy
yeast
also
becomes
a
dominant
aroma
light
wheat
bread
malts
peppery
spice
and
orange
tangerine
and
lemon
hops
once
it
hits
your
tongue
malt
character
is
similar
to
the
nose
light
and
crisp
wheat
and
bread
flavors
hops
maintain
a
strong
fruity
presence
all
the
way
to
the
finish
where
they
slowly
show
a
orangelemon
peel
bitterness
impressive
this
is
9
2
with
such
a
crisp
and
thin
body
tasty
hoppy
beer
hops
overpower
the
yeast
character
but
it
does
faintly
compliment
the
hops
overall
have
never
been
a
fan
of
belgian
ipas
not
going
to
lie
this
one
was
not
so
much
ipa
as
it
was
a
trippel
in
my
opinion
would
not
revisit
smells
hoppy
and
aggressive
some
nice
floral
aromas
very
belgiany
under
the
hops
tastes
bitter
and
hoppy
a
bit
harsh
but
a
really
nice
flavour
profile
thick
a
bit
syrupy
moth
feel
overall
pretty
enjoyable
but
harsher
than
i
typically
i
enjoy
o
not
a
bad
belgian
ipa
overall
but
i
get
the
feeling
that
most
would
be
able
to
find
an
ipa
that
is
either
american
english
or
belgian
which
would
suit
their
palate
better
overall
a
very
nice
beer
reminds
me
of
houblon
choufe
doublon
ipa
tripel
but
fresher
and
more
floral
very
tasty
id
highly
recommend
this
as
one
of
the
best
beers
you
could
consider
buying
if
available
o
a
real
good
belgian
ipa
not
much
more
to
ask
for
o
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
id
buy
it
again
id
like
to
get
a
pour
with
a
good
head
on
it
and
see
if
it
changes
this
beer
for
me
o
yum
this
essentially
takes
two
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
and
takes
the
best
aspects
of
each
one
whats
not
to
like
its
hoppy
bitter
and
malty
like
an
ipa
but
its
sweet
and
yeasty
like
a
tripel
honestly
this
is
my
first
foray
into
the
style
so
im
comparing
this
to
their
imperial
ipa
which
i
had
last
night
and
what
im
guessing
is
the
ipa
they
used
in
this
brew
it
shares
a
lot
of
the
aspects
of
the
imperial
ipa
but
its
less
intense
the
tripel
really
balances
it
out
im
definitely
digging
this
more
than
their
imperial
ipa
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
that
funky
bitterness
with
this
yeast
mixing
with
the
belgian
type
malts
this
made
for
a
sticky
and
sweet
and
delicious
beer
this
beer
is
very
characteristic
of
the
style
with
big
bitterness
this
bitterness
could
have
been
enhance
and
arguably
better
if
the
hops
had
even
more
of
a
presence
overall
o
a
very
nice
triple
a
bit
to
much
hop
but
i
guess
thats
american
dr
very
drinkable
but
the
quality
of
the
flavour
is
limited
the
abv
is
high
but
it
suffers
from
low
quality
this
ia
more
of
a
belgian
iipa
than
bpa
starts
off
with
a
very
tropical
hoppy
aroma
when
it
hits
the
tongue
i
get
some
that
tropical
fruit
a
bit
of
pine
then
a
slight
malt
sweetness
theres
a
noticeable
alcohol
burn
and
taste
just
before
the
finish
that
leaves
you
with
a
boatload
of
hop
bitterness
wow
i
didnt
expect
that
a
unique
experience
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
amazing
beer
and
has
obviously
been
crafted
by
experts
dedicated
to
the
betterment
of
their
craft
i
suspect
the
unique
qualities
of
this
beerspecifically
its
bipolar
flavor
profile
and
huge
bitternesswill
seem
offputting
to
many
and
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
the
brew
is
slightly
out
of
balance
and
tries
to
do
too
many
things
at
once
still
this
is
an
ale
that
has
to
be
tried
to
be
believed
and
is
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
beer
i
would
seek
it
out
again
for
sure
that
stylistic
schism
makes
the
mouthfeel
on
these
beers
hard
to
score
too
if
this
is
nominally
an
ipa
then
the
beer
is
too
thick
but
its
mostly
spoton
for
a
tripel
im
going
to
score
it
as
aboveaverage
and
call
it
a
day
overall
this
is
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
ill
likely
revisit
i
dont
much
care
for
belgian
ipas
that
arent
ipas
first
to
its
credit
le
freak
gives
a
strong
effort
as
far
as
that
kind
of
beer
goes
this
one
pours
orange
and
cloudy
medium
sized
and
almost
white
head
fruity
sweet
and
hoppy
aroma
a
nice
mix
of
bitter
and
sweet
it
has
the
long
bitterness
of
an
ipa
but
there
is
a
sense
of
the
belgian
yeastiness
and
sweetness
it
seems
like
the
new
wave
of
new
style
brews
overall
nice
mashup
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
at
1st
i
was
unsure
what
to
think
of
this
brew
however
afterwards
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
brew
normally
i
pass
green
flash
brews
up
because
the
labels
just
do
not
stand
out
ill
keep
my
eyes
open
from
now
on
o
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
both
the
smell
in
taste
but
the
combination
of
bitterness
and
spiciness
makes
this
more
of
a
sipping
beer
another
excellent
summer
drink
wonderfully
balanced
tasty
and
refreshing
love
this
beer
o
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
it
is
pleasant
to
drink
and
packs
a
punch
ill
be
grabbing
a
bottle
of
this
on
a
regular
basis
and
might
try
to
brew
a
clone
myself
o
eh
this
beer
is
pretty
forgetable
not
bad
at
all
but
it
does
not
come
through
as
advertised
if
youre
looking
for
an
interesting
blend
of
styles
as
i
was
this
will
dissapoint
through
no
fault
of
their
own
i
got
the
impression
that
this
is
a
west
coast
brewery
struggling
to
expand
their
profile
maybe
it
was
the
influence
of
the
boring
label
but
i
think
this
is
a
poor
example
of
a
green
flash
beer
they
have
better
beers
on
the
market
o
this
beer
is
great
might
not
be
my
favorite
true
belgian
ipa
but
still
is
a
delicious
take
on
the
style
and
a
great
beer
in
general
thanks
to
arniepnminne
for
this
great
brew
o
o
as
a
huge
tripel
fan
who
drinks
ipas
mostly
during
the
warmer
summer
months
i
found
the
scent
of
this
beer
irresistible
once
i
sniffed
it
however
the
tripel
quality
really
seems
buried
in
the
hoppiness
at
the
end
of
each
sip
a
good
offering
when
keeping
in
mind
the
challenges
of
mixing
the
divergent
styles
but
a
little
more
hoppy
than
i
was
hoping
id
like
the
yeast
to
star
a
bit
more
but
for
a
hophead
who
likes
the
bready
nose
of
a
tripel
but
would
prefer
it
finish
with
the
bitter
hoppiness
of
ipa
instead
of
that
sweet
maltiness
of
a
belgian
this
is
perhaps
a
dream
come
true
d
a
good
beer
was
definitely
not
dissappointed
i
enjoyed
this
one
different
kind
of
ipa
overallvery
nice
blend
nothing
wowd
me
but
it
definitely
is
a
nice
representation
for
the
style
and
for
someone
who
hasnt
had
manylike
me
t
lots
of
belgian
yeast
and
spice
upfront
with
a
bit
of
tropical
fruit
and
piney
hops
on
the
finish
pretty
solid
take
on
the
style
odefinitely
a
belgian
ipa
its
a
good
mix
of
bitter
hops
and
belgian
sugarsspices
its
also
fairly
complex
as
well
as
fairly
well
balanced
i
like
it
its
not
something
i
want
a
lot
of
but
its
definitely
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
a
good
marriage
of
belgian
yeast
and
a
san
diego
style
hoppy
and
bitter
ipa
better
carbonation
would
have
significantly
improved
a
couple
areas
but
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
opinion
overall
i
have
been
really
happy
with
this
beer
it
has
a
different
experience
in
flavor
and
really
favors
a
belgian
pale
overall
and
would
compete
with
any
of
the
best
of
them
in
my
opinion
that
said
it
isnt
necessarily
my
favorite
style
so
i
doubt
that
i
will
feel
the
need
to
go
back
here
but
it
was
a
good
experience
and
i
am
glad
that
i
took
roberts
word
for
this
one
hes
racking
up
credits
imo
my
first
time
here
might
as
well
go
for
something
ive
heard
good
things
about
it
pours
a
clear
amber
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
black
pepper
tart
mandarin
orange
lemon
zest
ruby
red
grapefruit
and
banana
the
taste
holds
notes
of
grapefruit
peel
orange
peel
lemon
zest
clove
banana
belgian
yeast
and
light
caramel
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
nearly
sticky
finish
overall
a
great
bipa
one
that
definitely
lives
up
to
the
billing
of
being
a
collision
between
ipa
and
tripel
very
good
times
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
the
lacing
on
the
glass
was
really
nice
too
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
packed
with
hops
and
some
belgian
yeast
the
aromas
of
fruits
pine
and
spice
all
wrapped
into
one
nosefull
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
really
nice
the
flavors
of
a
traditional
tripel
upfront
that
quickly
gets
pummeled
by
the
big
amount
of
hops
in
this
brew
the
taste
finished
with
a
dry
spicy
pine
flavor
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
very
delicate
for
such
a
beer
that
has
an
aggressive
side
overall
this
beer
was
a
lot
of
fun
to
try
overall
its
very
interesting
and
a
bit
odd
but
quite
enjoyable
great
job
on
creating
a
new
and
interesting
beer
for
me
to
try
whilst
on
vacation
in
cali
o
you
get
a
lot
of
whats
typically
good
about
west
coast
style
ipas
and
belgian
tripels
in
this
beer
but
very
little
of
what
is
potentially
great
in
either
or
the
combination
of
the
two
overall
a
solid
mix
of
styles
that
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
again
or
recommending
to
somebody
but
i
did
find
the
idea
of
this
beer
out
of
green
flash
was
more
exciting
than
the
reality
o
i
liked
the
variety
of
flavors
and
smells
but
i
think
this
beer
could
do
with
a
little
more
fizz
my
mouth
was
pretty
pumped
with
all
of
the
many
different
flavors
and
smells
but
the
finish
is
a
little
bit
bitter
and
lingered
in
my
throat
overall
complex
tasty
with
a
weird
finish
good
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
i
think
of
it
as
being
more
trippel
than
ipa
that
said
i
think
you
could
make
a
case
for
it
being
more
one
or
the
other
as
it
will
come
down
to
the
drinkers
interpretation
of
the
belgian
yeast
presence
however
the
hop
qualities
are
not
lost
and
kept
me
searching
the
depths
of
my
mandarin
tulip
i
think
the
mouth
feel
and
taste
make
for
a
wonderful
combination
each
are
good
on
their
own
but
the
thing
that
takes
this
up
a
bit
is
the
synergy
between
them
the
pepper
tingles
with
the
carbonation
and
the
yeast
coats
the
mouth
in
a
way
that
flavor
gaps
are
repaired
the
alcohol
is
there
but
it
is
not
by
any
means
a
partypooper
give
this
a
whirl
o
i
wish
i
could
get
this
on
the
regular
good
representation
i
enjoy
the
good
hop
presence
to
keep
a
control
on
the
belgian
influence
that
can
be
overpowering
sometimes
with
the
style
i
love
the
style
and
how
it
is
outside
the
box
if
the
joker
had
a
favorite
beer
style
this
would
be
it
drink
it
and
let
your
freak
shine
medium
body
a
little
sticky
and
with
a
longlasting
bittering
hop
aftertaste
this
is
definitely
a
good
blend
of
styles
bit
alcoholic
and
metallic
taste
lingers
on
the
finish
overall
a
nice
quaffable
brew
that
hits
the
spot
im
a
huge
fan
of
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
belgian
ipa
so
i
held
high
hopes
for
this
brew
unfortunately
i
feel
a
bit
let
down
as
it
seems
the
brewer
could
not
decide
which
direction
to
go
with
this
beer
so
she
decided
to
go
a
few
at
once
the
alcohol
content
is
very
evident
in
the
taste
and
the
bitterness
ismmore
metallic
than
bitter
for
10
for
the
bottle
id
spend
my
money
elsewhere
next
time
on
first
sip
i
was
dissappointed
that
the
west
coast
ipa
destroyed
the
tripel
but
this
brew
warms
up
nicely
on
the
palette
1pt
6
fl
oz
bottle
purchased
in
san
diego
not
a
huge
pale
ale
fan
but
this
is
a
good
beer
fair
hoppy
flavored
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
not
bad
for
a
pale
ale
beer
good
overall
color
body
texture
and
finish
abv
of
9
2
is
definitely
there
taste
is
more
robust
as
beer
warms
up
but
finish
heats
up
a
bit
too
o
a
long
way
behind
the
belgian
versions
of
this
style
this
beer
is
really
interesting
fresh
is
a
nice
citrus
and
floral
ipa
with
just
a
hint
of
funk
older
gets
fairly
funky
with
less
of
the
hop
profile
on
both
ends
its
a
great
beer
imo
this
is
a
fairly
standard
goto
for
me
when
i
have
to
pickup
a
beer
for
a
party
or
something
especially
for
newer
beer
drinkers
to
really
show
them
the
ropes
d
fun
and
flavorful
an
interesting
blend
of
styles
but
for
for
me
its
more
west
coast
than
belgian
lots
to
mull
over
here
plenty
of
character
but
a
real
mild
drinkability
as
well
in
spite
of
the
abv
pleasant
drop
yeah
its
a
good
blend
and
its
a
good
use
of
the
blend
individually
the
hoppy
characters
and
the
belgian
spice
wouldnt
make
either
a
good
ipa
or
a
good
belgian
ale
but
together
they
mesh
nicely
to
complement
one
another
what
you
end
up
with
is
a
rather
tasty
and
rather
unique
brew
green
flash
mixed
two
styles
perfectly
almost
like
those
old
old
reesee
cup
commercials
where
the
choclolate
bumps
into
the
peanut
butter
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
though
it
leans
a
little
too
far
toward
the
belgian
side
for
my
tastes
i
could
use
some
more
hops
d
the
beer
itself
is
good
will
certainly
seek
another
out
to
have
by
itself
the
labels
design
is
nice
too
making
it
stick
out
in
my
mind
final
verdict
a
drinkable
belgian
ipa
to
be
sure
worth
the
trade
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
tulip
glass
slightly
hazy
orange
bronze
with
a
thick
frothy
welllacing
offwhite
head
aroma
of
big
citrusy
grapefruity
hops
and
sweet
caramel
and
biscuity
belgian
malts
and
yeast
body
starts
with
good
malty
fullness
and
sweetness
well
balanced
with
bountiful
citrus
flavor
and
bittering
hops
before
a
crisp
slightly
warming
bittersweet
finish
definitely
my
favorite
brew
from
green
flash
d
crazygood
very
drinkable
definitely
recommended
after
just
two
of
them
ive
concluded
im
a
big
fan
of
belgian
ipas
i
could
absolutely
go
for
another
bomber
of
this
right
now
i
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
the
abvand
the
alcohol
is
rather
presentand
the
woody
aftertaste
dont
make
it
highly
drinkable
but
having
just
one
is
very
pleasurable
very
unique
characteristics
in
this
rather
unique
styled
beverage
the
combination
of
a
san
diego
pale
ale
and
begian
tripel
makes
for
one
of
the
more
interesting
brews
ive
had
in
awhile
this
is
a
sipping
brew
and
one
that
should
be
enjoyed
by
all
or
at
least
me
and
the
freaks
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
malt
and
hop
concoction
with
a
tropical
fruit
undertone
in
terms
of
the
belgian
ipa
style
le
freak
is
more
malty
and
hoppy
than
their
collaborative
bier
de
lamitie
with
st
feuillien
which
i
think
better
presents
the
tropical
fruit
elements
of
the
belgian
yeast
but
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
dont
really
taste
the
abv
level
due
to
the
powerfully
flavorful
elements
of
this
beer
but
it
can
creep
up
on
you
alcohol
comes
through
midglass
and
slows
this
down
to
an
easy
sipper
a
nice
blend
of
styles
pours
a
cloudy
orange
colour
with
thin
white
head
nice
head
retention
and
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
strong
citrus
hops
candy
sugar
and
belgian
yeast
lots
of
bitterness
in
the
flavour
with
the
dry
yeast
coming
through
quite
smooth
on
cask
id
love
to
have
this
again
the
9
is
somewhat
detectable
which
is
the
only
thing
that
would
limit
the
drinkability
on
this
one
otherwise
its
a
fine
blend
of
two
styles
that
i
very
much
enjoy
if
you
are
looking
for
a
hop
bomb
or
a
belgian
sweet
bomb
then
look
elsewhere
le
freak
tries
to
marry
the
two
and
pulls
it
off
quite
nicely
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
into
a
beer
mug
the
beer
is
a
bright
coppergolden
color
with
a
foamy
2inch
head
the
beer
has
smells
of
citrus
and
sweet
spices
an
even
blend
that
is
very
enticing
the
beer
has
initial
tastes
of
round
sweetness
with
a
base
of
spices
that
taste
like
coriander
and
cinnamon
there
are
also
hints
of
the
alcohol
in
the
beer
mixed
in
with
the
heavier
flavors
the
beer
has
a
spicy
and
somewhat
sour
finish
with
the
spices
and
sour
notes
present
on
the
aftertaste
the
beer
is
surprisingly
crisp
and
sharp
in
spite
of
the
bold
round
flavors
finish
is
pleasant
and
this
is
easily
a
getintrouble
drinkable
beer
could
polish
off
a
lot
of
this
one
in
a
given
sitting
very
tasty
light
and
pleasant
beer
d
this
is
a
damn
fine
bipa
even
though
its
not
as
hoppy
as
others
out
there
still
very
drinkinable
and
a
beer
thats
worth
finding
to
give
it
a
try
sometime
a
solid
drink
and
really
tasty
pours
dark
gold
with
a
solid
two
finger
head
hop
bitterness
up
front
with
a
sweet
malty
aftertaste
the
richness
from
the
tripel
with
the
up
front
flavor
of
a
good
pale
ale
nice
thick
lacing
as
it
opens
up
the
flavors
flip
the
tripel
up
front
with
a
pale
ale
finish
does
not
taste
at
all
of
a
9
2
brew
the
marriage
between
belgian
and
ipa
always
seems
a
tricky
proposition
the
sweetness
of
the
belgian
can
go
well
with
the
sweet
malt
of
a
big
ipa
but
the
bittering
that
goes
so
well
with
ipa
malt
does
not
always
integrate
with
the
belgian
sweetness
while
not
an
outstanding
beer
the
brewer
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
getting
everyone
in
the
boat
there
seems
something
here
that
is
just
a
bit
lacking
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
just
needed
a
bit
more
punch
in
either
the
hops
or
the
belgian
character
from
the
22
fl
oz
bomber
with
no
lot
codedate
sampled
on
december
2
2010
the
pour
is
a
highly
carbonated
pale
orangelight
amber
with
a
good
inch
of
delicate
foamy
tan
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
notes
of
yeast
wheat
grapeapricot
and
a
little
alcohol
the
body
feels
medium
with
a
kind
of
slick
honeylike
texture
on
my
tongue
the
beer
has
a
playful
weirdness
about
it
with
its
spectrum
of
yeast
malts
wheat
and
spices
up
front
and
a
sour
but
thin
hopped
ending
imho
a
pretty
poorly
executed
beer
the
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
belgian
flavors
is
completely
out
of
wack
this
brew
would
get
much
higher
marks
from
me
if
it
was
just
listed
as
a
dipa
but
im
rating
to
style
this
brew
is
completely
over
hopped
and
im
usually
a
fan
of
hoppy
beers
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
a
hops
forward
ipa
earthy
hops
have
a
good
bite
alcohol
well
hidden
along
with
the
other
ingredients
if
you
like
hops
and
alcohol
up
front
this
brew
will
suit
you
this
one
really
benefits
from
the
warmer
serving
temperature
but
still
isnt
as
enjoyable
as
a
traditional
sd
iipa
or
a
belgian
ipa
d
i
really
dont
like
the
flavors
that
come
with
a
tripel
and
unfortunately
they
are
way
too
present
in
this
for
this
to
be
enjoyable
for
me
i
like
the
citrus
hop
flavors
but
they
just
arent
strong
enough
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
very
nice
overall
this
ale
is
well
crafted
and
balanced
the
flavors
of
belgian
yeast
are
not
overdone
and
the
the
hops
bring
a
nice
complexity
its
not
quite
on
par
with
similar
beers
of
the
style
such
as
houblon
chouffe
dobbelen
ipa
tripel
but
i
would
drink
this
again
d
nice
enough
worth
trying
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again
d
an
above
average
brew
but
not
something
that
im
feeling
excited
about
1
was
probably
enough
d
this
beer
is
good
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
if
i
were
to
compare
it
to
triple
i
would
say
it
represents
the
style
well
i
dont
feel
it
holds
up
well
as
an
iipa
there
isnt
much
if
any
hop
flavor
or
aroma
d
its
been
my
experience
that
american
hops
dont
really
go
well
with
belgian
yeast
this
beer
didnt
disabuse
me
of
that
notion
a
shame
too
ive
been
a
big
fan
of
every
other
green
flash
beer
ive
had
very
drinkable
a
great
example
of
the
style
d
excellent
well
balanced
between
belgian
and
us
styles
abv
is
well
hidden
and
although
it
is
a
sipper
due
to
the
bitterness
it
is
quite
drinkable
such
a
good
beer
wish
i
had
more
of
it
drinkability
overall
isnt
what
i
want
from
the
style
most
versions
are
their
own
worst
enemy
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
that
american
hops
and
belgian
yeast
are
hard
to
harmonize
i
am
really
suprised
at
how
good
this
beer
is
a
touch
of
warmth
towards
the
finish
is
nice
and
considering
many
similar
beers
with
less
alcohol
are
far
more
boozy
green
flash
pulled
off
a
great
job
of
providing
flavor
instead
of
just
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
really
amazing
belgian
tripelipa
i
have
a
feeling
that
if
it
was
hopped
differently
if
could
stand
on
its
own
as
a
tripel
or
if
it
was
fermented
with
an
american
ale
yeast
it
could
easily
be
a
solid
dipa
the
combination
of
the
two
is
done
quite
well
i
paid
10
for
the
bomber
which
i
find
to
be
a
bit
expensive
i
feel
like
it
is
fairly
well
worth
the
price
but
it
will
not
be
a
frequent
purchase
because
of
it
pours
a
clean
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
dry
candy
sugar
and
small
hints
of
hops
in
the
taste
dry
candy
sugar
and
a
pine
like
hop
presence
a
small
hop
but
mainly
smooth
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
belgian
like
yeast
on
the
aftertaste
nice
hop
presence
with
belgian
like
hints
pours
a
nice
golden
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
big
durable
white
head
on
the
nose
i
get
lots
of
belgian
yeast
along
with
aromas
of
citrus
candi
sugar
and
a
little
spice
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
some
citrusy
hops
on
the
palate
along
with
a
little
spiciness
belgian
yeast
and
dark
brown
sugar
a
noble
experiment
and
a
delicious
beer
has
a
mediumplus
bodied
mouthfeel
with
about
average
carbonation
soso
drinkability
not
bad
but
personally
ill
be
set
with
the
one
bottle
drinkability
is
great
great
balance
showing
but
a
small
portion
of
its
alcoholic
strength
a
fine
example
of
the
style
american
hops
paired
well
against
the
base
belgian
yeast
and
malt
delicious
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
feels
a
bit
slick
going
down
some
alcohol
burn
not
bad
but
has
some
strange
character
to
it
thanks
russ
mfd
mediumfull
body
without
being
syrupy
nice
dryness
i
know
this
is
highly
rated
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
was
expecting
more
from
this
again
in
no
way
is
this
a
bad
beer
but
ive
had
much
better
belgian
ipas
d
for
how
freaky
and
demanding
as
this
beer
is
its
quite
good
it
definitely
takes
an
open
mind
and
a
little
getting
used
to
tasty
though
and
thats
all
that
matters
i
recently
saw
le
freak
on
tap
at
sidedoor
in
corona
del
mar
but
opted
for
new
belgiums
erics
ale
and
faced
with
the
same
choice
id
probably
do
it
again
but
im
a
sucker
for
sour
beers
le
freak
is
a
well
orchestrated
blend
of
an
american
ipa
and
belgian
tripel
hoppy
and
herbal
on
the
ipa
side
but
sweet
spiced
with
hints
of
dried
fruit
in
the
finish
one
of
the
better
style
combinations
ive
had
lately
le
freak
is
aptly
named
very
classic
belgian
styling
with
a
hoppy
american
kick
if
youre
tired
of
the
same
ol
beers
pick
this
one
up
green
flash
doesnt
disappoint
a
wonderful
beer
well
worth
trying
with
great
depth
on
the
palate
pours
a
clear
amber
with
the
slightest
haze
ive
ever
seen
its
there
if
you
really
look
beautiful
soapy
head
that
leaves
tons
o
lacing
and
mildly
carbonated
aroma
is
crammed
full
of
apricot
and
some
clean
and
crisp
hop
characteristics
right
underneath
maybe
some
green
apple
too
flavor
is
very
full
and
rich
carrying
the
apricot
from
the
aroma
and
melding
smoothly
into
a
great
hop
finish
very
nice
and
well
balanced
considering
its
supposed
to
be
hop
forward
nice
round
flavors
in
here
even
something
akin
to
butter
smooth
and
delicious
not
the
cheapest
in
the
world
at
6
49bomber
but
very
unique
and
pretty
good
worth
tracking
down
o
cleaner
and
better
than
other
bipas
ive
had
the
yeast
and
hops
dont
clash
but
the
dont
work
together
an
in
your
face
beer
bipas
are
clearly
a
style
that
is
trying
to
find
its
definition
i
am
not
sure
ive
found
what
that
is
for
me
not
even
piraat
quite
does
it
and
belgica
is
a
bit
lightsimple
hopefully
though
the
fullon
pairing
of
westcoast
hops
with
a
phenolic
tripel
will
be
dialed
back
to
something
more
refined
this
beer
is
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
hoppy
enough
to
satisfy
the
heads
with
a
fair
amount
of
belgian
yeast
and
even
certain
barleywineesque
notes
not
sure
how
many
other
beers
would
fit
a
new
category
but
this
is
a
belgian
dipa
for
sure
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
will
look
forward
to
cracking
another
one
open
when
the
opportunity
presents
itself
poured
a
dark
golden
color
into
tulip
glass
about
a
1
head
with
lots
of
bubbles
smell
of
citrus
off
the
glass
first
taste
of
a
belgian
trippel
hits
the
tastebuds
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
belgian
trippel
taste
then
goes
a
little
sweet
on
the
backend
good
drinkability
as
the
different
styles
of
belgian
trippel
and
ipa
mixes
together
i
can
taste
the
two
styles
together
very
interesting
d
a
good
drinkable
interesting
beera
nice
marriage
of
the
belgian
and
american
styles
this
is
a
very
bold
belgian
ipa
hardy
flavors
from
top
to

youth

considering
michael
cera
is
certainly
a
freak

considering
this
is
such
an
odd
hybrid
style
and
that
its
9
2
this
is
a
damn
drinkable
beer
its
got
a
nice
belgian
floral
bite
to
it
and
a
really
good
belgian
character
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
it
combines
for
a
very
beergeekcentric
flavor
profile
thats
really
enjoyable
i
think
i
paid
10
for
this
and
its
worth
the
price
d
overall
pretty
good
has
the
feel
of
a
typical
tripel
but
not
with
the
sweet
or
heaviness
mouthfeel
is
quite
carbonated
full
body
and
a
dry
finish
d
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
the
triple
the
hops
add
a
nice
crisp
character
and
go
nicely
with
the
spice
and
candied
sugar
not
overtly
sweet
but
enough
to
notice
would
recommend
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
billing
as
a
freakish
tripeldipa
hybrid
though
i
would
not
classify
it
as
a
belgian
ipa
its
too
big
smell
is
of
wood
and
alcohol
taste
is
a
powerful
drying
effect
from
hops
that
probably
include
fuggle
along
with
stiff
caramel
malts
and
a
bitter
alcohol
backbone
body
is
medium
to
full
but
the
beer
finishes
dry
if
youre
a
fuggle
and
northern
brewer
fan
line
up
for
a
romp
through
the
woods
d
unusual
and
fun
to
drink
drinkability
despite
this
ales
high
abv
is
great
given
it
wonderful
balanced
flavor
d
if
you
like
bitter
beers
youll
like
this
it
has
everything
an
american
ipa
should
have
plus
some
malts
that
you
wouldnt
get
otherwise
this
is
kind
of
a
beer
lovers
beer
in
that
way
if
you
just
wanted
a
mondobitter
ipa
it
doesnt
fit
the
bill
likewise
if
you
wanted
a
classic
tripel
youll
also
be
disappointed
wanna
try
something
new
youll
like
this
9
abv
makes
it
a
bit
hairy
though
i
enjoyed
it
but
probably
wouldnt
order
it
again
the
pour
resulted
in
a
big
yellowishtan
head
with
outstanding
retention
color
was
a
very
cloudy
deepapricot
nose
had
an
odd
yeastdriven
earthiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
strong
sourness
undoubtedly
borne
of
the
yeast
that
wormed
its
way
through
the
liquid
extreme
no
doubt
iipa
and
trippel
i
would
not
have
guessed
without
cheating
up
it
was
quite
sour
especially
on
the
finish
i
did
not
feel
that
it
was
the
sume
of
its
parts
although
mine
was
definitely
the
minority
opinion
on
this
occasion
i
even
thought
it
compared
to
a
saison
a
slow
sipper
this
one
knocks
your
mouth
out
on
first
punch
and
keeps
coming
delicious
but
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
half
a
bomber
22

a

golden

throughout

pale

flavor

peppery
yeast
and
a
touch

mouthfeel

dry
bitter
that
sticks
around
for
a
good

great
one
i
really
enjoy
this
style
overall
a
pleasant
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
the
belgian
yeast
and
the
hops
do
not
meld
together
as
nicely
as
id
like
and
at
times
this
can
seem
like
two
seperate
beers
even
with
this
i
found
this
enjoyable
certainly
worth
the
opportunity
to
try
d
really
great
beer
but
probably
just
want
to
have
one
considering
the
bitterness
and
abv
huh
weird
beer
but
i
like
it
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
sudsy
thick
cream
colored
head
that
lasts
and
good
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
medium
amber
aroma
is
vineous
yeast
malt
fresh
baguettes
and
fresh
hay
flavor
is
like
aroma
but
also
uncludes
good
hop
and
some
pale
malt
sweetness
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
also
has
a
tinge
of
acid
and
is
of
some
length
mmmmm
not
a
session
perhaps
one
or
two
i
think
this
could
have
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
the
belgian
profile
lends
a
bit
of
chewiness
the
abv
limits
the
drinkability
but
this
is
still
a
very
nice
beer
deep
golden
with
a
slight
amber
tinge
creates
virtually
no
head
honey
sweetness
with
some
allspice
like
spiciness
very
slight
hop
oiliness
is
also
present
in
the
aroma
i
also
get
bananas
as
it
warms
very
foamy
on
the
first
sip
without
a
carbonation
bite
no
noticeable
sign
of
high
abv
typical
belgianstyle
aromatic
esters
up
front
but
very
muted
and
hard
to
determine
any
overriding
characteristics
very
bitter
back
end
without
the
pine
or
citrus
from
a
west
coast
ipa
imo
a
good
example
of
combining
two
styles
with
results
substantially
below
the
sum
of
the
parts
pours
a
deep
golden
amber
color
with
a
large
fluffy
bubbly
white
head
that
sticks
for
a
while
smells
of
spicy
hops
slight
twinge
of
orange
or
tangerine
with
a
spicy
belgian
yeast
character
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
slight
mineral
edge
followed
by
some
spicy
earthy
hops
finishing
with
a
sweetness
and
that
twang
of
belgian
yeasties
moderate
level
of
carbonation
sweet
syrupy
mouthfeel
medium
body
nice
americanized
belgian
ipa
taste
leans
more
towards
an
ipa
but
im
good
with
that
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
quite
nice
i
liked
the
big
hop
bitterness
and
more
minor
role
played
by
the
belgian
yeast
it
was
a
touch
sweet
at
times
and
i
would
be
concerned
that
the
beer
wouldnt
age
well
as
the
hops
die
off
i
think
the
sweetness
would
become
increasingly
unwelcome
a
great
balance
between
tripel
and
ipa
not
necessarily
a
beer
that
wowed
me
or
one
that
id
hunt
down
again
but
you
can
tell
its
wellmade
and
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
world
if
all
beers
were
like
this
the
ipa
hoppiness
added
a
really
interesting
flavour
to
the
typical
belgian
style
its
both
calm
and
slightly
syrupy
and
a
little
carbonated
at
the
same
time
i
really
like
this
beer
and
think
it
would
go
well
with
any
meal
it
would
match
a
nice
dinner
just
as
well
as
an
outdoor
picnic
pint
at
galaxy
hut
arlington
dtoo
bitter
for
me
so
i
probably
wouldnt
have
it
again
but
if
that
is
your
thing
you
would
probably
like
this
one
a
lot
d
it
comes
across
as
a
bit
heavier
than
i
would
like
but
that
could
be
the
maltforward
aspect
it
certainly
hides
the
9
2
abv
d
if
this
beer
were
not
9
2
this
would
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
around
this
beer
is
an
absolute
gem
in
the
hybrid
style
of
belgian
ipas
many
breweries
try
but
there
are
only
a
few
that
have
managed
to
meld
the
2
styles
together
as
flawlessly
as
green
flash
has
done
on
this
one
find
this
beer
this
beer
tastes
and
feels
much
more
like
a
dipa
than
an
belgian
ipa
very
hop
forward
with
lots
of
earthy
pine
and
citrus
fruit
notes
hints
of
grapefruit
mango
and
pineapple
with
a
decent
malt
back
bone
that
provides
nice
balance
very
bitter
throughout
with
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
and
bone
dry
finish
so
this
is
how
you
do
this
style
i
loved
it
in
a
tulip
it
was
a
gold
color
maybe
a
bit
on
the
orange
side
thick
white
head
with
copious
lace
aroma
of
an
ipa
and
a
tripel
floral
and
citrus
combining
with
sugar
and
yeast
same
thing
with
the
taste
mostly
grapefruit
a
little
pine
with
cotton
candy
and
yeast
a
balanced
combination
would
drink
this
one
anytime
d
a
great
once
in
a
while
beer
i
couldnt
have
it
everyday
but
once
in
a
while
it
would
be
perfect
very
nice
with
indian
food
d
out
of
this
and
piraat
the
only
two
belgium
ipas
ive
tried
i
like
piraat
better
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
its
just
a
tad
syrupy
and
medicinal
for
my
tastes
probably
wont
buy
again
beer
is
oddly
spicy
bittering
in
back
with
kind
of
a
sharp
bite
to
the
whole
thing
overall
the
bitterness
and
the
citrus
just
dont
quite
work
together
definitely
not
doing
it
for
me
it
just
seems
off
eh
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
unique
beverage
instead
its
just
a
grassy
boozy
dipa
oh
well
not
for
me
such
a
great
flavor
combination
i
will
definitely
be
having
this
one
again
not
bad
at
all
though
this
is
more
of
a
one
and
done
for
me
this
tries
to
be
a
tripple
and
a
belgian
ipa
it
comes
up
short
on
both
ends
there
are
much
better
examples
of
both
a
costly
bottle
worth
checking
out
at
least
once
though
but
definitely
not
the
best
san
diego
area
belgian
ipa
verdict
le
freak
could
break
either
way
bitter
and
pithy
tripel
or
belgianinfused
san
diego
ipa
its
pleasant
enough
and
certainly
lives
up
to
the
promised
mix
of
san
diego
and
belgium
though
it
doesnt
quite
strike
the
note
i
was
hoping
for
i
like
the
concept
and
most
of
the
flavors
but
the
hops
are
just
a
little
too
medicinal
for
me
d
very
interesting
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
a
beer
with
such
a
deep
flavor
profile
every
sip
was
a
different
transition
from
sweet
to
bitter
i
liked
it
and
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
but
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
it
again
because
of
the
8
price
tag
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
perhaps
a
little
too
much
going
on
almost
muddled
instead
of
complex
but
in
the
end
stays
together
decently
enough
as
an
expression
of
some
of
the
best
of
both
worlds
might
get
a
little
ahead
of
itself
in
terms
of
boldness
and
thus
being
categorized
alongside
the
likes
of
chouffe
and
de
ranke
doesnt
do
it
any
favors
unfortunately
probably
not
one
ill
be
reaching
for
again
with
many
better
examples

wish
there
was
more
hop
aroma
flowers
and
coriander
spice
add
depth
also
allowing
for
clarity
and
separation
of
the
flavors
the
semitropical
feel
of

so
i
wont
be
buying
it
an

your

in

and
spicy

apricot

bold
and
tasty
brew
a

going

sounds

help
to
dry
out
what
would
otherwise
be
a
beer
with
some

grassy
hop
notes
are
noticeable
up

and
the
beer
picks
up
some
palegrain
sweetness
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
still
it
is
fairly
dry
over
all
a
biting
in
any
case
this
is
a
good
beer
not
a
great
beer
but
something
i
will
buy
again
worth
the
adventure
would
i
recommend
it
maybe
it
is
not
horrible
the
only
downfall
is
the
boozetaste
perhaps
buy
a
couple
of
these
and
share
between
a
friend
or
two
the
taste
is
amazing
the
color
is
good
everybody
must
drink
this
the
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
as
it
drinks
towards
a
68
beer
a
good
balance
of
hoppiness
belgian
character
light
malt
and
a
crisp
finish
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
slightly
weak
aroma
otherwise
it
is
a
flavorful
version
on
a
belgium
ipa
the
yeast
phenolics
do
not
overpower
the
hops
but
instead
blend
to
create
a
wellbalanced
taste
bud
stimulation
a
10
5
abv
is
hard
to
hide
but
the
balance
between
the
phenolics
and
hop
terpenes
ties
the
ethanol
up
nicely
it
is
only
hinted
at
by
flavor
and
not
noticeable
in
the
aroma
the
heavy
lacing
and
golden
body
make
this
an
attractive
pour
as
well
overall
if
you
like
the
style
youd
be
welladvised
to
buy
as
many
bottles
as
you
can
find
if
you
dont
like
the
style
it
is
definitely
worth
your
time
and
money
to
buy
one
bottle
and
try
it
it
may
change
your
mind
enjoy
will
have
again
worth
making
an
effort
to
try
o
a
nice
beer
different
than
any
belgian
ipa
ive
had
it
is
sweeter
and
fruitier
this
is
a
second
chance
review
for
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
it
was
right
after
enjoying
a
hibernus
and
it
didnt
stack
up
now
i
have
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
this
with
friends
decent
beer
lots
of
spice
fair
sweetness
but
a
bit
too
dry
which
doesnt
quite
fit
in
with
the
rest
of
the
palate
this
is
a
standing
want
as
i
dont
know
when
ill
get
back
to
that
area
served
in
pfriem
chalic
lovely
golden
body
with
a
huge
sticky

froth
really
nice

minus
some

that
green

tang
god
damnit
bright
orange
zest
fresh
cut
grass
grapefruit
peach
bubblegum
belgian
yeast
great
this
is
a
killer
version
of
a
belgian
ipa
quite
intense
for
the
style
yet
still
incredibly
balanced
keep
your
eye
out
for
this
if
you
are
in
the
quebec
province
might
buy
again
especially
in
the
summer

verdict
a
nice
belgian
ipa
and
one
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
i
was
able
to
pick
this
bottle
up
when
i
was
in
montreal
on
recommendation
and
was
not
disappointed
the
alcohol
could
be
dialed
back
a
bit
and
i
think
it
would
really
help
this
beer
out
otherwise
the
hop
character
is
a
really
pleasant
aspect
appearance
is
gold
and
clear
with
generous
white
head
and
tons
of
spotty
lacing
nose
is
full
of
spicy
belgian
yeast
with
mellow
hop
character
faint
caramel
in
the
back
and
plenty
of
belgian
yeast
and
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
overall
nice
balance
worth
a
try
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
dry
yeast
and
notes
of
green
apples
in
the
taste
earthy
hoppy
a
touch
funky
and
a
dry
green
apple
sweetness
a
spice
like
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
spice
and
earthy
hop
in
the
aftertaste
hides
the
10
a
mellow
hop
presence
but
a
bit
saison
like
o
the
taste
and
scent
is
unparalled
the
lupulus
manages
to
combine
the
best
of
a
saison
triple
and
ipa
and
takes
the
best
of
those
styles
and
mingles
them
the
cost
of
this
brew
out
on
the
west
coast
was
rather
high
but
that
doesnt
compromise
the
overall
enjoyability
overall
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
dangerously
easy
drinking
for
a
10
beer
and
never
gets
boring
quality
very
good
after
dinner
overall
an
outstanding
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
definitely
one
of
the
best
in
style
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
the
biggest
flaw
i
found
was
that
there
was
a
ridiculous
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
only
halfpour
my
glasses
without
them
overflowing
aside
from
that
this
beer
was
quite
easy
to
enjoy
and
its
quite
easy
for
me
to
recommend
this
to
anybody
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
blown
away
by
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
slight
fruity
sweetness
and
bite
from
the
alcohol
there
really
is
nothing
special
about
the
nose
although
it
seems
quite
refined
and
balanced
the
beers
taste
has
a
bold
yeast
presence
and
modestly
hoppy
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
taste
beer
but
im
not
sure
its
quite
worth
the
price
i
found
far
more
enjoyment
in
drinking
bitter
monk
pours
clear
golden
in
color
with
a
large
white
head
great
bready
malt
aroma
with
some
floral
hops
citrus
hops
and
plenty
of
yeast
and
spice
a
really
great
nose
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
yeast
to
go
with
citrus
peel
pine
and
a
mild
herbal
note
bready
malt
with
a
touch
of
cracker
to
go

it

grade

my
first
a

reviewed
300
beers
now
and
dominus
vobiscum
lupulus
is
the
best
one
yet
hows
that
for
a
capper
it
is
mouthwateringly
good
with
perfect
balance
and
absurdly
high
drinkability
for
something
of
its
heft
at
over
10
bucks
a
bottle
and
with
limited
availability
i
had
to
drive
to
london
to
get
this
its
not
something
i
can
get
regularly
but
i
may
just
head
back
to
procure
a
few
more
bottles
before
its
gone
for
another
year
this
is
a
musttry
combining
the
best
of
both
the
ipa
and
belgian
beer
in
general
o
this
is
really
refreshing
well
balanced
clean
and
drying
its
pretty
darn
impressive
there
is
a
lot
of
subtlety
in
this
beer
that
i
keep
finding
as
it
warms
as
i
drink
it
id
love
to
try
this
beer
again
thanks
sammy
believe
this
to
be
an
excellent
example
of
the
belgian
ipa
style
clear
gold
body
with
a
voluminous
white
head
great
retention
and
loads
of
lacing
exemplary
for
the
style
nose
has
herbal
noble
hops
tropical
fruits
and
some
orange
a
bit
of
sulphur
as
well
i
think
still
quite
vibrant
for
what
ive
been
used
to
recently
within
the
style
taste
has
a
sweet
fruity
malt
component
almost
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
golden
strong
at
points
before
being
cut
but
a
tropical
hop
profile
and
some
bitter
citrus
rind
long
and
significantly
drying
herbal
finish
full
feel
with
a
medium
high
effervescence
and
some
alcohol
a
very
nice
belgian
ipa
but
a
bit
too
bitter
for
regular
and
mass
consumption
in
my
eyes
i
really
love
this
style
and
this
is
a
great
example
the
hops
and
yeast
play
well
together
i
can
clearly
identify
both
but
they
also
mix
in
a
delicious
fugue
quite
sweet
to
taste
up
front
and
just
enough
bitterness
at
the
finish
belgian
type
character
up
the
middle
tastes
better
at
just
below
room
temp
than
cold
as
the
beer
is
better
able
to
show
itself
off
just
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
at
the
front
end
of
this
one
but
quite
good
overall
and
worth
a
try
a
great
continental
ipa
seek
this
out
if
you
get
the
chance
very
balanced
and
rich
tasting
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sure
i
could
see
some
of
the
flavours
and
smells
popping
a
little
more
in
the
aroma
and
taste
but
the
apparence
and
mouthfeel
are
totally
nailed
if
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
come
by
well
id
be
drinking
it
more
often
if
youre
looking
for
a
fresh
take

style

is

here
truly
a

makes

beers
o
a
world
class
brew
with
a
unique

really
blown
away
by
this
brew

definitely

it
even
at

if
you

it
buy

it
were
finished
a
bit
drier
and
i
would
like
to
try
it
with
a
little
less
bottle
age
on
it
as
well
light
to
medium
bodied
with
an
abundance
of
soft
pillowy
carbonation
it
feels
smooth
creamy
velvety
and
light
in
the
mouth
this
is
one
hell
of
beer
full
of
bold
flavours
held
in
a
delicate
balance
and
being
so
strong
yet
drinking
as
easy
as
a
beer
half
its
strength
its
like
the
angels
themselves
fermented
the
essence
of
heaven
and
bottled
it
dangerous
and
very
delicious
a
sensational
brew
even
though
it
runs
at
about
11
bucks
i
will
happily
go
back
for
more
of
this
great
example
of
the
style
and
another
winner
from
charlevoix
o
this
is
good
its
refreshing
bitter
and
juicy
all
in
one
great
bottle
no
knowledge
of
latin
is
needed
to
understand
the
word
of
this
saintly
brewer
dominus
vobiscum
lupulus
translates
to
the
the
lord
be
with
you
hops
both
figuratively
as
well
as
literally
it
is
a
divine
creation
that
brims
with
angelic
fruits
blissful
pungency
anointed
yeast
and
heavenly
drinkability
it
is
true
holy
water
if
ever
there
was
amen
again
ill
say
it
microbrasserie
charlevoix
is
the
best
microbrewery
in
quebec
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
overall
a
pretty
unique
beer
with
some
atypical
characteristics
there
are
some
things
about
it
that
i
really
liked
and
some
that
were
soso
the
flavor
wasnt
really
in
my
wheelhouse
but
i
can
see
how
some
would
like
it
overall
just
a
fabulous
looking
beer
i
cant
say
belgian
style
ipas
are
my
thing
but
this
one
is
pretty
nicely
done
beer
is
an
attractive
hazy
golden
color
with
a
creamy
ivorycolored
head
aroma
is
a
melange
of
yeast
citrus
hops
and
malt
taste
is
assertive
and
malty
up
front
with
almost
sweet
yeastiness
and
a
pleasant
heaviness
finish
is
hoppy
and
citrus
not
too
dry
mouthfeel
is
substantial
with
some
nice
alcohol
warming
overall
this
is
a
big
solid
beer
a
nice
fusing
of
a
quebecstyle
belgian
ale
with
an
ipaesque
hoppy
edge
bottle
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
very
lively
white
head
big
sticky
left
on
the
glass
as
the
head
settles
soft
aroma
of
fruit
and
spice
some
must
very
soft
on
the
palate
peach
apricot
and
pear
flavor
are
really
nice
really
nice
and
flavorful
easy
drinking
m
medium
body
with
a
good
chew
light
carbonation
this
is
a
really
fantastic
beer
really
enjoyable
maybe
my
favourite
canadian
beer
a
gem
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
i
really
liked
the
nose
a
bit
dry
decent
drinkability
brilliantly
clear
light
golden
yellow
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
spicy
yeasty
honeylike
floral
grassy
mildly
rustic
and
has
a
prominent
saaz
hop
character
very
fruity
this
is
brilliant
the
palate
opens
a
little
sweeter
than
id
like
with
honey
grainy
sweetness
sugar
a
little
bit
of
splenda
a
real
hop
tea
flavor
is
present
on
the
midpalate
with
a
ton
of
saaz
flavor
sweet
but
with
a
lingering
hop
resin
character
saaz
tea
there
is
also
a
touch
of
butter
earth
and
yeast
flavors
medium
light
in
body
moderately
carbonated
this
beer
has
an
excellent
finish
with
a
lingering
resiny
hop
character
highly
recommended
hv
overall
wonderful
combination
of
flavors
a
little
drier
and
less
sweetness
and
this
would
be
spot
on
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
didnt
think
it
was
as
complex
or
as
interesting
a
belgian
ipa
as
hibernus
was
a
strong
dark
ale
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
the
others
in
the
group
did
but
dont
think
id
seek
it
out
again
like
i
would
hibernus
thanks
again
freud
for
hooking
us
up
with
these
ones
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
above
average
overall
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
with
some
great
flavors
it
had
some
great
balance
for
the
style
which
really
helped
soften
the
sometimes
overpowering
yeast
spice
the
citrusy
bitter
flavors
really
worked
for
me
as
well
in
this
one
and
they
really
integrated
well
into
the
overall
flavor
very
well
made
and
taste
beer
overall
id
definitely
put
it
up
there
with
any
of
the
belgian
made
versions
of
the
style
ive
had
overall
really
dug
this
one
just
as
authentic
good
as
ales
from
belgium
maybe
better
worth
the
hype
for
this
worldclass
beer
overall
i
just
could
not
get
into
the
groove
of
this
beer
i
am
usually
a
big
fan
of
belgian
ipas
but
there
was
just
something
about
this
one
that
did
not
sit
well
with
me
perhaps
a
fresher
bottle
may
have
been
a
bit
more
to
my
liking
it
was
definitely
worth
trying
though
poured
a
hazy
medium
copper
color
with
a
large
frothy
offwhite
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
excellent
lacing
moderate
sour
citrus
and
yeast
aroma
medium
body
with
a
smooth
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
duration
very
good
brew
a
fantastic
beer
way
to
go
alex
o
love
it
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
i
am
glad
i
can
get
more
of
this
asap
od
no
alcohol
at
all
lovely
flavour
more
like
a
tripel
very
nice
i
liked
this
alot
and
im
looking
forward
to
aging
it
well
done
charlevoix
beer
is
thin
to
medium
in
body
minimal
carbonation
in
the
mouth
but
a
pretty
good
belgian
ipa
overall
the
beer
is
nice
and
sweet
with
good
esters
and
nice
hop
flavors
on
the
midpalate
of
the
beer
the
overall
experience
is
nice
with
moderate
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
i
would
gladly
put
this
in
the
top
5
beers
ive
ever
had
and
im
happy
to
say
that
its
from
canada
worth
every
penny
and
then
some
this
is
a
must
try
drinkability
on
this
isnt
very
high
with
the
size
of
the
bottle
its
more
of
a
sharing
beer
not
to
mention
the
high
abv
allinall
its
an
intriguing
ale
but
not
something
id
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
occasion
or
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
this
in
the
same
stretch
as
the
duvel
triple
hop
and
must
say
that
this
is
a
bit
more
broad
the
interesting
thing
is
that
it
has
a
healthy
abv
interaction
its
not
noticeable
but
it
does
have
subtle
hints
that
make
it
more
pleasant
it
just
as
brisk
as
a
duvel
would
be
there
is
fruits
in
this
one
golden
clear
with
a
wonderful
cauliflower
head
but
the
pop
gave
way
to
a
pilsner
hopmalt
quality
that
was
undeniable
this
was
almost
momentary
though
this
quickly
opened
up
into
something
more
acidic
notes
of
triple
like
esters
fruit
qualities
of
persimmon
and
sour
earthy
hints
palate
was
a
hint
of
sweet
with
a
sour
white
grape
and
a
floral
earthiness
that
first
gave
way
to
rosemary
then
a
mineral
hop
quality
that
make
me
think
of
the
grit
of
straw
palate
as
it
warms
has
hints
of
lychee
but
with
a
significantly
more
bitter
note
than
that
i
came
across
in
the
hill
farmstead
e
this
has
almost
a
chalky
note
to
it
which
dries
any
quality
of
elixir
sugar
the
10abv
sweetness
could
provide
on
the
spectrum
of
palate
range
this
is
a
lot
of
flavors
that
seem
to
come
into
the
palate
very
pin
point
but
expand
violently
as
it
is
experience
by
whom
which
ever
brings
on
an
appetite
too
with
an
overthetop
creaminess
this
beer
is
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
its
crisp
and
refreshing
and
has
a
lot
of
body
as
well
overall
if
this
beer
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
id
buy
this
every
time
i
drink
beer
which
is
obviously
quite
often
everyone
should
try
this
not
just
fans
of
the
style
clear
ambergold
with
a
huge
white
cap
that
leaves
webbed
lacing
beautiful
beer
smells
green
herbal
spicy
white
pepper
and
fresh
cut
herbs
pale
crackery
malt
tastes
really
really
nice
ripe
pear
white
pepper
cut
grass
and
fresh
herbs
very
hoppy
but
evenly
balanced
between
yeast
malt
and
hops
finishes
intensely
dry
and
spicy
fantastic
stuff
a
special
special
thanks
to
flipper2gv
both
for
the
patience
and
the
understanding
a
true
gentleman
mouthfeel
was
good
very
dry
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
drinkability
smooth
and
clean
this
is
as
balanced
as
any
belgian
ipa
i
have
had
drink
the
look
of
the
bottle
and
the
beer
once
poured
was
truly
fantastic
i
would
suggest
sharing
this
bottle
among
friends
and
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
and
750ml
might
be
a
bit
much
for
one
person
great
beer
from
one
of
the
best
microbrewery
this
is
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
belgian
ipa
it
is
spicy
and
moderately
bitter
with
a
big
fruity
hop
kick
though
they
could
have
dry
hopped
it
a
bit
more
i
think
belgian
ipa
is
the
perfect
label
for
this
beer
much
too
hoppy
to
be
a
tripel
imo
glory
ws
this
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
for
the
size
the
alcohol
is
not
discernible
in
the
flavour
though
i
do
start
to
feel
the
effects
half
way
through
the
bottle
quaffable
though
i
recommend
you
dont
im
really
loving
this
brew
i
think
it
has
really
come
together
nicely
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
the
belgian
qualities
take
over
with
a
year
or
two
of
age
as
a
blurb
on
the
bottle
suggests
fresh
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
among
the
nicest
ive
had
the
chance
to
try
d
i
love
the
idea
of
the
belgian
ipa
and
the
execution
here
is
fantastic
high
octane
with
the
hops
being
big
enough
to
shine
in
the
face
of
strong
belgian
flavour
characteristics
d
an
easy
drinker
for
10
abv
this
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
wasnt
all
that
impressed
initially
but
another
nice
offering
from
one
of
canadas
best
breweries
my
first
belgian
ipa
and
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
all
in
all
very
drinkable
and
more
belgian
tripel
then
american
ipa
d
hard
to
drink
for
me
due
to
the
taste
if
you
like
duvel
you
should
seek
this
one
out
a
very
good
and
tastey
beer
worth
getting
a
hold
of
doing
canada
proud
a
unique
hoppy
belgian
strong
pale
ale
which
even
flirts
with
some
elements
of
a
saison
at
times
worth
trying
if
you
can
obtain
it
though
there
may
be
better
options
for
less
money
in
the
belgian
ipa
category
d
is
it
worth
the
price
i
found
la
chouffes
offering
much
better
than
this
with
a
lower
price
tag
by
no
means
a
disappointment
but
the
theres
better
value
to
be
had
elsewhere
an
honorable
and
tasty
offering
but
it
produced
less
of
experience
than
i
was
hoping
for
d
a
really
nice
belgian
ipa
some
nice
belgian
spice
and
fruit
would
try
again
i
wasnt
sure
what
kind
of
belgian
pale
i
was
getting
with
this
70
ibu
beer
i
thought
it
would
be
more
like
the
bruerys
mischief
but
instead
its
more
in
the
lines
of
an
authentic
belgian
ipa
or
ever
de
dolles
ara
bier
i
say
go
for
it
but
expect
something
a
little
different
d
my
first
from
charlevoix
and
im
quite
impressed
belgian
at
its
core
but
with
a
lot
of
north
american
flair
a
great
hybrid
this
is
a
great
beer
no
doubt
a
little
high
on
the
sweetness
but
everything
about
it
is
tasty
d
fantastic
was
this
beer
10
drank
like
a
fine
champagne
and
gets
you
just
as
buzzed
just
as
quickly
dangerous
in
that
sense
yet
a
fantastic
beer
d
very
drinkable
all
around
big
thanks
again
to
viggo
super
glad
that
i
was
able
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
an
allaround
great
brew
my
kind
of
strong
belgian
ale
low
on
the
overtly
astringent
yeastiness
big
on
the
spicy
fruit
and
organic
esters
just
hoppy
enough
to
further
the
aim
of
balance
and
a
nice
round
10
points
of
alcohol
to
boot
for
which
youd
need
an
experienced
bloodhound
to
track
down
their
whereabouts
bravo
once
again
charlevoix
overall
a
near
perfect
example
of
a
strong
pale
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
one
better
then
this
go
seek
this
out
worth
every
penny
truly
outstanding
work
from
one
of
the
best
brewers
in
canada
and
id
say
north
america
a
wonderful
ale
and
far
too
drinkable
for
10
nothing
is
too
harsh
or
overpowering
kudos
to
charlevoix
for
bringing
this
back
and
living
up
to
expectations
this
is
a
terrific
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
much
as
the
10
sneaks
up
on
you
but
its
quite
refreshing
for
such
a
big
beer
big
thanks
to
colin
for
cracking
this
one
d
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
it
blew
both
the
inferno
and
avery
salvation
i
had
at
the
hopleaf
beer
dinner
immediately
afterward
out
of
the
water
the
bitterness
is
there
but
its
not
brash
and
the
heat
only
makes
the
slightest
presence
about
halfway
through
the
750ml
bottle
a
musttry
bottle
nice
appearance
goldcopper
pour
with
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
pretty
complex
belgian
yeast
pineapple
orange
peel
flowers
and
pepper
nice
intense
flavors
with
lots
of
hops
grapefruits
herbs
and
a
tropical
fruits
fnish
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
with
well
balanced
carbonation
great
beer
um
nailed
it
charlevoix
pretty
much
did
that
with
this
hoppy
strong
belgian
pale
if
this
is
what
its
like
young
then
its
going
to
age
in
a
phenomenal
fashion
i
could
very
easily
drink
this
all
day
yet
not
get
anything
done
as
a
result
while
it
ends
in
tears
worth
the
price
of
admission
and
even
though
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
comes
only
in
family
size
im
more
than
happy
for
that
and
all
the
extra
goodness
i
got
as
a
result
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
for
a
long
time
and
it
definitely
didnt
let
me
down
the
numbers
i
gave
lupulus
just
made
it
my
highestrated
beer
and
i
dont
disagree
with
that
at
all
this
beer
is
easily
worldclass
thanks
charlevoix
im
stoked
on
this
beer
its
something
special
after
watching
it
soar
up
the
canadian
top
25
i
assumed
there
was
a
little
hype
involved
but
i
was
wrong
thinking
that
well
deserving
of
its
place
in
the
canadian
top
10
and
i
would
guess
it
will
settle
in
the
top
5
let
it
be
known
this
isnt
even
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewer
think
about
that
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
cloudy
white
head
the
head
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
go
away
with
lacing
all
down
the
glass
it
smells
of
floral
hops
citrus
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
lives
up
to
the
smell
nice
bitterness
in
with
the
classic
belgian
pale
ale
taste
some
caramel
and
hoppiness
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
the
bubbles
being
very
tight
i
dont
notice
the
alcohol
in
this
which
i
suppose
could
be
dangerous
because
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
i
was
able
to
get
enough
bottles
overall
the
2007
bottle
lost
all
its
bitterness
that
i
liked
so
much
in
the
2009
bottle
maybe
it
is
due
to
2
different
versions
i
dont
know
i
didnt
drank
a
fresh
2007
bottle
and
im
not
sure
i
will
cellar
a
2009
drinkability
is
great
great
balance
not
terribly
deep
or
complex
but
better
than
most
in
its
style
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
bodied
pretty
chewy
with
high
but
fine
carbonation
really
feels
good
and
goes
down
way
too
smooth
for
the
abv
no
alcohol
comes
through
at
all
this
is
great
stuff
i
see
the
reputation
is
deserved
this
is
like
a
hoppier
la
fin
du
monde
well
a
great
americanized
version
of
a
strong
belgian
pale
this
brew
is
extremely
balanced
and
has
a
great
great
taste
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
brew
and
im
an
imperial
stout
guy
very
very
impressive
wow
this
just
made
it
into
my
favorite
beers
i
absolutely
want
to
try
and
clone
this
one
some
day
bottle
deep
golden
pour
unleashes
a
beautiful
frothy
white
cap
leaving
plenty
of
lace
spicy
fruity
nose
hints
at
rose
petal
and
fresh
hops
with
lots
of
citrus
and
a
blast
of
cotton
candy
smells
good
i
dont
really
like
the
sweetness
here
but
the
flavour
profile
is
still
pretty
good
sweet
mango
and
apple
with
yeasty
flavours
lead
to
spices
and
candied
malts
the
hops
dont
come
through
in
the
flavour
the
way
they
were
calling
at
me
in
the
aroma
pretty
good
beer
to
be
sure
a
bit
overhyped
though
a
bottle
brought
down
from
jean
of
quebec
city
had
it
previously
just
after
it
was
released
in
07
very
fresh
and
extremely
aromatic
then
this
bottle
had
mellowed
to
the
point
of
faded
hop
glory
but
malt
profile
was
still
plenty
sturdy
and
the
alcohol
nearly
invisible
had
become
very
sneaky
for
10
retained
a
puffy
longlasting
head
and
the
aroma
although
muted
was
still
inviting
highlyhopped
this
beer
gains
no
benefit
from
aging
if
you
are
a
hophead
but
is
still
enjoyable
if
the
balance
more
toward
the
malt
end
is
preferred
hardly
any
available
now
so
enjoyed
it
for
its
rarity
at
this
point
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
representation
of
the
style
period
id
definitely
never
have
had
the
chance
to
taste
this
had
it
not
been
for
my
main
man
phil
bright
gold
w
2
fingers
of
foamy
white
head
lots
of
orange
aromas
with
light
notes
of
dried
spices
like
coriander
plus
some
leafy
parsley
palate
is
super
bright
and
spicy
right
off
drying
yeast
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
flavors
of
orange
and
light
mango
white
pepper
and
spiciness
not
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
left
in
this
beer
long
finish
with
a
touch
of
drying
mint
this
is
a
complex
and
delicious
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
highly
recommended
if
you
can
still
find
it

pretty

very

very

you
can
wait
that
long
wowza
this
beer
really
opens
up
as
it
breaths
and
you
get
to
know
her
i
had
to
kick
up
the
numbers
twice
as
i
sipped
and
im
only
finishing
my
first
glass
bottle
poured
a
deep
lightly
cloudy
golden
color
ale
with
a
huge
pure
white
foamy
head
with
perfect
retention
and
some
great
lacing
aroma
of
west
coast
hops
with
some
notes
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
and
some
nice
floral
notes
can
also
be
detected
taste
is
perfect
balance
between
some
light
sweet
belgian
malt
with
huge
notes
of
floral
hops
with
notes
of
grapefruit
full
body
with
a
somewhat
creamy
texture
with
some
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
really
enjoyed
how
the
hops
presence
brought
aromatic
notes
but
left
a
light
controlled
bitterness
as
much
as
i
had
enjoyed
the
chouffe
houblon
i
believe
this
one
is
even
more
enjoyable
smd
o
this
was
pretty
tasty
though
not
truly
outstanding
this
is
a
style
that
i
think
has
a
definitive
ceiling
at
least
to
my
palate
the
characteristics
of
a
belgian
ipa
dont
always
play
well
together
but
this
seemed
to
be
as
good
as
any
of
them
recommended
to
try
this
is
an
awesome
beer
that
im
glad
i
have
one
more
of
great
job
pipeworks
mouthfeel
is
great
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
lot
of
bitterness
o
this
is
an
awesome
beer
that
i
have
overlooked
for
too
long
another
great
offering
from
pw
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
around
hunt
it
down
this
is
a
solid
dipa
that
isnt
gonna
blow
anyone
away
with
its
hop
presence
or
bitterness
but
instead
really
accomplishes
a
nice
balanced
belgian
ipa
well
done
i
was
surprised
with
how
much
i
liked
this
beer

i
can
easily
see
why
theres
such
a
fuss
about
pipeworks
among
craft
beer
enthusiasts
in
chicago
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
that
successfully
pulls
off
complexity
without
becoming
incoherent
thirstquenching
and
interesting
this
beer
would
be
great
for
any
time
and
place
o
a
good
americanbelgian
ipa
made
with
american
hops
that
lacks
coherence
very
enjoyable
belgian
ipa
and
something
different
hunted
from
20
west
wine
and
spirits
pours
generous
head
on
light
yellow
body
floral
hoppy
aroma
i
liked
this
because
of
the
spices
rather
than
yeast
being
emphasized
in
this
style
smooth
mouthfeel
very
good
drinkability
overall
4
00
by
far
the
thing
they
need
to
work
on
here
is
the
taste
there
is
just
too
much
fruitlemon
presence
for
me
it
fits
into
the
style
very
well
though
and
is
actually
very
satisfying
though
it
is
heavier
than
other
belgians
ive
had
i
attribute
that
character
to
a
better
body
profile
needs
a
slight
bit
of
work
then
this
will
be
an
excellent
beer
o
fantastic
well
balanced
belgian
style
ipa
not
overly
hoppy
or
yeast
heavy
another
great
offering
from
pipeworks
it
seems
they
really
impart
nice
dank
hop
flavors
in
their
ales
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
in
one
of
their
beers
cheers
tasty
beverage
big
belgian

plenty
of
tropical
american

a
murky

with
a
foamy

around
the

on
the

smell
is
of

citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest

taste
is
much
the
same
with
soapy
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
overall
this
was
a
wonderful
change
of
pace
and
an
overall
great
beer
i
would
like
to
sip
this
on
a
warm
summer
day
paired
with
some
food
on
the
grill

m
ill
have
my
eyes
peeled
for
this
one
in
the
future
another
amazing
beer
by
pipeworks
if
these
guys
continue
to
put
out
quality
beer
like
this
local
chicago
brewers
will
need
to
watch
out
i
love
bitter
beers
but
this
ipa
seems
to
lack
a
little
more
balance
and
depth
for
the
style
not
bad
but
not
something
i
plan
on
picking
up
again
browned

medium

and
belgian

finishes
it
off
bitter
well
into
the
finish
medium

no
alcohol
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
american
take
on
the
style
a
good
representation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
this
just
showed
me
theres
hope
for
the
style
a
solid
blend
of
belgian
yeast
and
american
hops
drink
it
you
wont
regret
it
overall
another
singular
creation
by
the
brewers
at
pipeworks
every
one
of
their
beers
i
have
tasted
tastes
like
nothing
else
this
was
another
great
brew
from
pipeworks
i
hope
they
keep
this
in
the
regular
rotation
o
an
addition
to
a
spicier
ipa
worth
the
pour
and
worthwhile
of
drinking
a
bottle
8
0
abv
is
good
too
lends
to
a
stronger
palate
and
discussion
among
friends
o
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
other
belgian
style
ipas
to
compare
this
to
but
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
a
d
a
very
nice
take
on
a
style
i
dont
generally
enjoy
well
done
guys
would
happily
drink
this
again
and
hope
that
pipeworks
makes
another
batch
in
the
near
future
o
i
like
this
take
on
a
cross
between
a
belgian
and
an
american
ipa
obviously
the
two
styles
are
similar
but
this
beer
does
manage
to
be
both
unified
between
the
two
styles
yet
still
have
distinctly
different
characteristics
o
pretty
nice
yeah
i
missed
out
on
my
precious
sushi
but
at
least
i
can
commiserate
with
friends
and
beers
right
this
one
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
zest
mandarin
orange
light
lemon
zest
sweet
caramel
and
a
touch
of
pineapple
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
light
leek
and
a
very
small
contingent
of
what
seems
like
salt
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
dont
really
get
too
much
belgianness
going
on
regardless
id
readily
have
another
o
very
nice
balance
full
flavored
delicious
o
a
very
balanced
and
delicious
take
on
the
style
i
would
like
a
little
more
hops
but
it
was
nice
none
the
less
a
great
refreshing
beer
chalk
up
another
great
beer
for
the
boys
at
pipeworks
o
a
nice
beer
one
of
the
better
belgianstyle
ipas
ive
had
o
good
beer
i
have
probably
drank
100
x
more
american
ipas
than
belgians
so
its
not
a
go
to
style
for
me
also
some
others
i
have
had
more
recently
have
more
weiss
notes
where
this
is
more
spice
and
bitterness
a
light
sweetness
at
first
with
lots
of
citric
fruit
pink
grapefruit
and
orange
something
almost
tropical
about
it
nice
complimentary
yeast
that
lends
some
esters
and
spice
to
the
mix
moderately
bitter
aftertaste
balancing
the
light
sweetness
upfront
a
hint
of
malt
in
the
middle
but
this
is
a
showcase
of
how
well
the
hops
and
yeast
dance
together
lighter
feel
creamy
drying
in
the
finish
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
of
fruit
and
light
pepper
good
stuff
will
definitely
look
for
more
of
before
its
gone
overall
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
great
as
other
reviewers
but
certainly
good
overall
not
bad
in
its
category
i
much
prefer
duvels
triple
hop
to
this
one
i
just
dont
care
for
the
hop
flavor
in
this
one
it
really
is
an
herbal
bitterness
its
not
citrusy
or
piney
just
more
of
a
herbal
bitter
i
would
pair
this
with
a
strawberry
and
bacon
salad
with
a
lemon
vinaigrette
i
gets
a
90100
from
me
o
probably
my
favorite
dachouffe
brew
possibly
the
standard
i
hold
all
belgian
ipas
to
its
ahead
of
its
time
packed
full
of
class
and
down

some
mild
malts
less
complex
than
i
expected
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
was
expecting
whole
lot
more
from
this
one
not
bad
good
masking
of
the
alcohol
content
houblon
chouffe
truly
is
an
oldie
but
a
goodie
one
of
the
original
belgian
ipas
it
is
still
among
id
argue
the
best
one
out
there
i
dont
remember
ever
having
a
single
draft
pour
or
bottle
that
left
me
smiling
any
less
than
ear
to
ear
if
you
dont
care
for
this

this
is
a

can
perch

fruitiness

grain
flavors
wrestle
with
belgian
banana

bubble

and
both
confront
american

levels
of
assertive
hop
bitterness
the
beer
has
the
belgian
body
coming
across
lighter
and
more
digestible
than
a
beer
this
big
should
be
the
bottled
versions
are
more
highly
carbonated
and
the
carbonation
comes
across
finer
and
softer
than
the
tap
versions
while
the
individual
components
stand
out
as
you
drink
they
come
into
focus
and
balance
and
in
the
end
by
the
finish
they
work
surprisingly
well
i
prefer
the
750
ml
bottle
to
the
tap
version
o
definitely
a
belgian
tripel
had
more
in
commonwith
val
dieu
or
straffe
hendrik
tripel
than
any
american
ipa
overall
wow
i
cant
believe
i
passed
on
this
for
so
long
pick
it
up
even
if
its

refreshing

has

im
sentimental
about
anything
chouffe
since
they
made
the
first
belgian
beer
that
i
loved
poured
from
a
750

bottle
into
a
spiegelau
ipa
glass
giant
sudsy
head
with
a
yellow

is
remarkable
everything
you
like
about
a
belgian
ale
combined
with
a
hoppy
ipa
lacing
is
incredible
from
top
to
bottom
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
should
be
on
everyones
bucket
list
one
hell
of
a
beer
o
very
flavorful
ipa
with
the
hoppy
notes
of
an
english
ipa
but
the
yeasty
funk
and
foamy
carbonation
known
in
belgian
beers
really
interesting
combo
where
i
stay
interested
long
after
the
first
and

and

nice
ipa
tripel
hybrid
that
everyone
should
taste
i
am
smelling
pine
clove
and
yeasty
aromas
the
flavor
of
fruit
and
spice
grapefruit
and
lemon
with
a
warm
finish
overall
a
enjoyable
beer
not
a
hop
bomb
or
standard
west
coast
ipa
but
one
that
id
buy
again
if
in
a
pinch
while
looking
for
an
ipa
final

a
flawless
a
houblon

is
a
positively
fantastic
belgian
ipa
that
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
i
have
had
several
belgianbrewed
bipas
over
the
past
month
or
so
and
this
one
is
definitely
my
favourite
of
the
bunch
delightfully
rich
and
hoppy
yet
shockingly
quaffable
a
musttry
and
that
is
not
a
description
that
i
bandy
about
lightly
o
the
team
at
brasserie
dachouffe
have
themselves
a
winner
in
houblon
choffe
ipa
tripel
if
assured
of
getting
this
as
fresh
as
this
bottle
purchased
at
brewery
ommegang
in
cooperstown
ny
this
would
be
a
staple
as
such
i
will
check
for
bottling
dates
best
by
of
which
i
think
is
two
years
and
will
be
certain
to
purchase
within
3
months
of
it
being
bottled
another
feather
in
the
cap
for
the
belgians
using
pacific
northwest
hops
to
brew
a
lofty
beer

and
this

does
not
taste
as
strong
as
it
is
very
interesting
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
would
love
to
drink
more
of
this
if
you
dont
have
expectation
try
it
if
youre
a
hophead
there
a
lot
of
belgian
ipas
on
the
market
still
overall
this
on
tap
is
a
great
drink
but
i
was
expecting
magic
compared
to
out
of
the
bottle
served
too
cold
for
my
tastes
but
still
a
great
and
personal
favorite
beer
of
mine
medium
body
high
carbonation
and
creamy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
with
well
hidden
alcohol
a
really
enjoyable
beer
liked
it
a
lot
o
this
is
an
amazing
beer
light
in
feel
but
complex
yet
subtle
in
flavor
the
total
package
and
easily
the
best
belgian
ipa
i
have
tasted
i
will
be
checking
this
out
a
lot
more
than
i
would
have
imagined
oone
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
and
would
have
again
hard
to
believe
it
is
abv
9
not
very
noticeable
as
someone
else
described
this
beer
champagne
ipa
great
brew
4
2
stars
i
knew
this
would
be
an
interesting
beer
as
it
combines
my
favorite
style
of
beer
with
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
the
combination
actually
works
although
it
is
a
bit
more
hopped
up
than
i
prefer
the
triple
part
of
adds
complexity
and
flavors
i
like
although
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
hopped
up
belgian
beers
i
have
ever
tried
definitely
worth
trying
out
glad
i
tried
something
a
little
different
overall
a
very
delicious
and
quaffable
belgian
ale
i
love
the
tropical
citrus
married
with
belgian
yeast
and
this
is
probably
the
best
belgian
ipa
i
have
had
another
great
beer
from
another
great
brewery
its
like
hoppy
champagne
whats
not
to
like
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
o
right
up
there
with
chimay
4

atmosphere
is
really
nice
lots
of
effervescence
nice
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
light
hops
and
yeast
yeasty
character
is
very
prominent
lemon
pith
is
quite
prominent
as
well
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
still
as
the
beer
warmed
it
mellowed
out
a
bit
and
i
began
to
appreciate
it
a
bit
more
o
a
little
let
down
heard
good
things
but
basically
got
a
weak
tasting
barleywine
no
grassy
or
fruity
hop
characters
maybe
a
fresher
bottle
would
be
better
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
prefer
the
le
chouffe
original
ale
as
the
extra
hop
i
this
beer
covers
up
what
makes
le
chouffe
a
truly
great
beer
a
perfect
combination
on
carbonation
belgian
yeast
and
a
slight
hint
of
hop
overall
pretty
awesome
bipa
the
smell
is
a
bit
deceiving
because
more
qualities
appear
on
the
palate
when
the
beer
was
drank
o
this
is
balanced
out
really
nicely
with
bold
flavors
bottle
from
proof
bottle
shop
poured
into
a
champagne
glass
tons
of
really
bubbly
offwhite
head
with
a
slightly
hazy
orangy
yellow
color
aroma
is
sweetly
floral
grassy
and
touch
of
yeasty
goodness
taste
has
a
good
hop
bitterness
some
spicyness
and
with
the
same
floral
notes
coming
through
also
some
light
sweet
malt
and
a
good
amount
of
the
fruityness
i
associated
with
tripels
very
light
on
the
tongue
but
the
bubbles
and
hop
spice
kinda
bite
at
the
tongue
i
definitely
enjoy
this
beer
had
this
seminal
example
of
an
ipa
triple
at
a
taphouse
in
calgary
the
beer
arrived
in
a
legit
chouffe
goblet
a
light
orange
with
a
little
whitish
foam
smells
of
citrus
hops
i
get
a
lot
of
orange
and
pineapple
as
well
as
aromatic
buttery
yeast
a
few
floral
and
spicy
notes
palate
includes
these
features
as
well
along
with
some
red
berry
strawberry
peachapricot
green
grapes
and
a
hint
of
toffee
a
fair
amount
of
residual
sweetness
and
overall
i
get
a
strong
boozy
pineapple
effect
sweet
grains
provide
a
backdrop
a
little
like
honeyed
pancakes
and
then
boom
you
get
a
powerful
medicinal
blast
of
mixed
herbs
coriander
bitter
roots
and
leaves
licorice
a
little
clove
i
love
massive
ipas
and
yet
i
was
still
a
bit
awestruck
by
the
bitter
woody
finish
i
agree
that
the
alcohol
is
wellconcealed
at
first
but
i
started
getting
a
fusel
burn
or
some
ethyl
acetaye
about
halfway
through
at
which
point
the
bitter
finish
started
to
seem
coarse
and
overpowering
still
deserves
some
of
the
accolades
rjt
this
beer
quickly
became
a
favorite
for
me
and
my
girlfriend
a
very
well
rounded
and
mature
drink
try
it
i
will
say
though
that
im
very
disappointed
that
the
subsequent
bottles
ive
had
here
in
north
american
have
not
evoked
the
same
blissful
memories
i
had
at
this
fateful
bar
in
vancouver
the
bottles
ive
found
here
have
a
similar
sweetnessscitrus
flavor
but
lack
the
hops
im
not
sure
if
they
brew
it
here
or
its
a
bottling
issue
in
europe
its
equally
as
good
but
find
this
ontap
and
please
try
it
it
is
simply
amazing
overall
this
beer
is
great
you
have
the
tripel
components
and
also
hoppy
notes
as
well
this
beer
is
balanced
with
not
an
assault
of
hops
on
your
tongue
but
enough
to
let
you
know
they
are
there
if
you
like
hop
resin
in
your
beer
this
should
be
no
problem
punishing
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
if
you
like
hoppy
ales
and
belgian
ales
there
is
no
reason
why
you
havent
tried
this
one
yet
this
is
recommended
o
different
had
to
try
it
with
the
description
of
a
tripel
ipa
o
i
like
how
the
hops
tame
the
yeast
in
this
tripel
it
works
o
not
so
sure
about
the
tends
to
ipa
statement
but
definitely
a
little
dryness
behind
the
mildy
fruit
flavors
4
25
d
this
is
one
of
those
that
can
quickly
creep
up
on
you
considering
how
easily
drinkable
it
is
still
cant
get
over
how
well
balanced
and
well
executed
the
two
styles
are
a
hoppy
and
complex
tripel
hops
enforcements
have
suited
much
better
here
than
average
for
the
style
but
do
not
expect
a
dipa
it
is
definitely
belgian
overall
this
one
is
pretty
unique
hop
character
is
very
american
ipaish
but
then
comes
the
spicy
yeasty
part
with
soft
malt
character
works
well
together
and
creates
a
wonderful
dynamic
recommended
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
hybrid
style
beer
that
was
pleasing
to
my
palate
and
will
certainly
motivate
me
to
sample
more
belgian
ipas
nowhere
near
as
hoppy
as
an
american
ipa
but
thats
okay
because
this
beer
is
balanced
and
drinkable
and
delicate
even
at
9
abv
it
pours
a
lovely
pale
straw
color
clear
bubbly
and
accumulating
a
massive
white
fluffy
head
with
good
staying
ability
the
nose
is
hoppy
sure
but
its
light
in
a
way
too
fruity
not
too
bitter
and
balanced
out
well
by
potent
belgian
yeast
and
some
wheat
malt
not
sweet
at
all
wondering
if
this
tripel
style
skipped
the
candy
sugar
it
finishes
clean
yeasty
and
hop
forward
balanced
but
all
elements
contribute
in
a
distinct
way
grassy
vibe
too
fantastic
stuff
and
you
cannot
taste
the
booze
at
all
really
light
body
and
typical
belgian
yeast
effervescence
yum
probably
the
best
belgian
ipa
its
a
style
that
can
get
messy
but
this
one
works
bravo
bravo
i
say
overall
this
beer
is
an
amusement
park
for
your
mouth
the
casual
drinker
will
enjoy
it
for
the
adventureous
hops
profile
the
keen
observant
drinker
will
giggle
in
delight
at
the
simple
sublety
of
this
beer
rich
and
savory
with
simple
but
satisfying
esters
a
lingering
hops
exploration
on
multiple
levels
perfectly
balanced
with
the
sweet
barley
body
you
should
definitely
try
this
one
a
smooth
enjoyable
drink
more
tripel
than
ipa
tricky
balance
more
towards
the
malt
like
a
british
ipa
on
draft
at
the
old
monk
in
dallas
o
a
nice
tripel
with
a
light
ipa
influence
from
the
hops
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
out
there
for
the
sole
reason
that
it
allows
the
belgian
influence
to
rule
instead
of
the
ipa
side
definitely
a
classic
and
probably
the
innovatorinventor
of
the
style
the
beers
taste
matches
its
outstanding
appearance
in
terms
of
quality
but
it
is
surprising
in
its
dusky
deep
character
the
finish
is
light
on
the
palate
but
only
after
an
initial
sensation
that
is
neither
sweet
nor
bitter
but
rather
and
simply
serious
woody
it
is
pithy
ipa
is
in
the
name
but
this
is
not
at
all
what
the
term
would
lead
those
raised
on
contemporary
american
craft
ipas
to
expect
the
taste
is
as
bold
as
the
americans
but
is
distinctly
different
and
did
i
mention
the
head
this
is
one
expertly
crafted
beer
one
that
i
will
enjoy
over
and
over
again
im
not
sure
of
the
age
on
this
bottle
but
id
love
to
get
a
fresh
one
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
awhile
finally
getting
around
to
it
its
even
better
than
expected
exceptional
overall
just
a
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
very
best
if
not
the
best
in
the
style
that
has
the
ability
to
quench
thirst
enjoy
a
a
fine
sipper
and
can
serve
any
purpose
in
between
meeting
the
approval
of
belgian
lovers
hopheads
and
just
about
anyone
in
between
world
class
all
the
way
o
im
very
familiar
with
tripels
but
never
had
a
tripel
that
is
apparently
hopped
like
an
ipa
very
delicious
if
i
come
across
this
again
i
will
definitely
purchase
o
wow
this
is
some
good
stuff
definitely
amongst
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
really
nice
and
smooth
and
very
well
balanced
you
can
enjoy
everything
this
beer
has
to
offer
doesnt
drink
like
a
9
beer
very
floral
and
smooth
you
can
really
take
nice
full
sips
and
enjoy
a
truly
great
beer
received
a
bottle
as
a
gift
i
cant
believe
i
waited
several
weeks
before
drinking
this
it
pours
as
a
lightorange
golden
color
with
a
magnificent
foam
head
that
sticks
around
like
frosting
on
the
top
of
the
beer
has
a
very
pleasant
crisp
lemon
peel
scent
a
nice
bitter
feel
at
the
beginning
of
each
sip
but
it
as
it
goes
down
the
taste
transitions
smoothly
to
a
classic
tripel
this
is
a
truly
amazing
beer
it
doesnt
seem
to
suffer
from
the
same
angeldevil
feel
as
a
lot
of
hoppy
belgian
beers
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
an
outstanding
accidental
discovery
o
overall
i
would
consider
this
a
world
class
beer
the
color
is
perfect
to
the
tripel
style
where
the
hop
flavor
takes
over
in
the
finish
and
accents
the
west
coast
ipa
style
the
english
side
in
this
beer
is
the
overall
balance
between
the
two
perhaps
all
three
styles
are
accented
in
a
sense
thats
why
i
consider
this
to
be
phenomenal
oyouve
got
to
get
this
this
is
really
a
wonderful
drinking
beer
with
its
medium
mouthfeel
and
packs
tons
of
compelx
flavors
i
would
say
i
even
like
this
more
than
la
chouffe
overall
impression
a
creative
and
well
executed
beer
combining
american
ipa
hopping
with
belgian
tripel
malt
and
yeast
character
grapefruit
and
orange
hop
bitterness
with
heavy
pale
malt
and
belgian
yeast
character
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
beer
never
disappoints
the
complexity
between
the
hop
and
yeast
profiles
is
awesome
and
it
all
melds
into
a
final
product
that
any
beer
enthusiast
must
try
i
think
ill
pick
up
a
four
pack
soon
the
fact
that
this
is
9
is
also
absurd
i
think
i
drank
75
of
the
beer
in
like
8
minutes
spectacular
beer
would
have
again
without
a
second
thought
o
interesting
ipa
tripel
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
lots
of
complex
flavors
and
aromas
and
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
classic
brew
overall
coming
into
this
i
had
a
little
bit
of
a
preview
at
the
brewery
and
i
enjoyed
it
then
having
it
as
a
whole
bottle
it
was
really
enjoyable
the
hoppy
character
is
actually
refreshing
since
the
body
is
a
medium
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
a
friend
hopefully
ill
run
into
it
again
cheers
beer
was
a
pale
straw
color
and
a
little
hazy
when
served
definitely
smelled
the
phenolic
spiciness
from
the
yeast
in
the
nose
i
do
not
like
a
ton
of
the
clovey
flavors
in
my
belgians
this
one
had
just
enough
to
let
you
know
it
was
a
belgian
without
being
obnoxious
a
little
more
hops
would
have
made
this
beer
a
solid
4
0
the
flavor
is
smoothly
lemony
with
a
floral
note
it
pops
and
crackles
yet
finishes
smooth
and
spry
really
enjoyable
this
tripel
ipa
is
outstanding
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
loves
sweet
herbal
champagnelike
taste
this
beer
goes
incredibly
well
with
smoked
sausage
pretentious
hamburgers
wagyu
beef
with
sharp
cheddar
cheese
and
caramelized
onions
with
some
garlic
and
everything
pizza
this
beer
is
amazing
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
fun
beers
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
a
sensory
rollercoaster
ride
a
perfect
harmony
of
overthetop
americanstyle
hop
aggression
and
deft
belgian
brewing
technique
very
heady
yet
supremely
drinkable
this
will
go
down
as
one
of
my
highest
rated
beers
and
for
good
reason
overall
having
really
high
expectations
as
la
chouffe
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
it
surpassed
them
on
par
with
normal
la
chouffe
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
a
world
class
beer
that
everyone
should
try
fairly
bitter
hop
notes
with
nice
complex
yeast
esters
and
a
hint
of
funk
a
little
too
bitter
dominant
for
my
palate
but
i
love
the
esters
its
a
good
beer
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
amazing
though
it
is
easy
to
enjoy
my
palate
keeps
taking
me
back
to
a
sushi
restaurant
on
that
note
it
would
probably
pair
great
with
most
seafood
hazy

not
noticed
and
very

certainly
drink
a

more
of
this

are
dominant
with
bready

funky
yeast
bread
and
a
touch
of
banana
beneath
a
nice
variety
of
delicate
distinguishable
flavors
o
light
and
refreshing
balances
the
ipa
triple
style
to
offer
the
fruityyeasty
triple
profile
with
hops
that
compliment
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
light
enough
for
a
lunch
without
noticeable
alcohol
i
could
see
drinking
this
along
side
a
blue
cheese
micro
greens
salad
the
crisp
tartness
would
be
a
solid
foundation
for
creamy
and
earthy
cheese
oa
nifty
little
marriage
of
some
sweet
hickory
smoked
bacon
and
fruit
charming
and
endearing
would
pair
well
with
chicken
or
fish
well
crafted
o
ill
definitely
need
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
because
i
know
that
chouffe
is
way
better
than
the
score
ive
got
for
this
old
bottle
tripels
can
have
this
amazing
ability
to
hold
onto
the
hops
flavor
and
aroma
for
a
couple
years
and
aroma
but
this
bottle
tastes
like
its
a
an
old
american
double
ipa
unfortunately
there
was
no
date
on
the
label
to
assist
me
when
i
bought
it
o
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
would
love
to
have
it
fresher
to
see
if
more
of
the
hops
come
through
otherwise
i
wont
be
spending
so
much
on
this
beer
again
didnt
blow
me
away
but
interesting
for
sure
might
need
a
full
glass
of
this
stuff
for
a
better
assessment
o
a
great
beer
very
unique
and
well
done
o
great
balance
of
a
traditional
belgian
tripel
and
ipa
nice
to
see
the
hops
as
a
star
here
overall
this
is
my
first
belgianmade
belgian
ipa
and
it
is
quite
different
from
what
i
am
used
to
in
the
us
where
they
are
just
american
ipas
with
belgian
yeast
this
is
more
like
a
belgian
strong
palegolden
ale
with
a
lot
more
spiciness
i
like
it
a
lot
overall
the
most
balanced
and
perfectly
composed
belgian
ipa
ive
had
the
hops
lend
flavor
without
too
much
bitterness
messing
up
the
belgian
profile
underneath
more
sophisticated
and
tasty
than
piraat
and
duvel
tripel
hop
will
revisit
this
one
with
a
fresh
bottle
someday
overall
what
an
incredible
beer
everything
is
tightly
balanced
on
all
departments
it
has
a
simple
and
pleasant
smell
an
interesting
and
refreshing
taste
and
a
very
nice
texture
one
of
the
best
belgian
beers
on
the
market
definitely
a
must
try
crazy
interesting
to
say
the
least
the
head
just
sits
there
for
minutes
like
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
wonderfully
smooth
complex
hints
of
citrus
at
first
then
as
it
warms
the
banana
releases
from
the
yeast
the
alcohol
is
subtle
and
the
finish
is
crispy
and
bold
i
would
suggest
this
beer
for
anybody
who
like
me
has
a
wary
view
of
ipas
but
these
belgians
have
constructed
a
fine
tripel
that
just
wants
to
be
enjoyed
the
fullness
of
the
look
in
the
glass
slightly
cloudy
bekons
for
the
adventure
ahead
not
sure
how
i
missed
this
fine
beer
for
so
long
but
glad
we
found
each
other
to
conlcude
this
was
a
fantastic

sneaky
as
you
would
expect
a
good

to
be
didnt
see
a

on
the

i
think
the
hops
have
somewhat
faded
in
this
bottle
but
something
id
definitely
try
again
not
sure
if
i
would
pay
7
however
o
a
great
beer
which
i
will
now
continue
to
have
as
often
as
possible
this
will
be
my
go
to
belgian
ipa
whenever
im
caving
a
hop
bomb
with
a
belgian
twist
also
a
good
intro
beer
for
those
nonbelgian
all
american
ipa
drinkers
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
for
sometime
definitely
didnt
dissappoint
smell
is
amazing
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
really
good
as
well
an
interesting
combination
this
is
more
on
the
triple
side
hops
actually
become
more
prominent
as
the
beer
warms
but
it
does
achieve
a
really
nice
balance
in
its
profile
try
it
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
ever
had
sitting
on
a
cloud
of
judgement
pours
up
a
cloudy
honey
golden
with
a
big
white
head
great
lacing
nose
of
honey
lemons
and
poop
pops
tastes
of
lemons
honey
white
pepper
body

carbo
is
smooth
i
got
this
beer
as
a
christmas
gift
woooop
o
this
is
just
a
really
pleasant
and
truly
refreshing
brew
highly
suggest
even
for
the
price
poured

draak
tulip
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
huge
half
glass
of
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
dissipating
eventually
to
pillowy
lacing
aroma
of
spicy
orange
sweet
malt
belgian
yeast
and
spices
flavor
is
peppery
light
fruit
and
citrus
tripel
spicing
with
an
emphasis
on
coriander
finishing
with
a
pleasant
well
hopped
bitterness
complemented
by
the
spices
medium
bodied
with
active
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
melding
of
the
tripel
and
ipa
styles
and
great
to
drink
like
other
chouffe
ales
othis
might
be
my
favorite
of
the
chouffe
family
which
is
saying
something
the
taste
is
complex
and
always
evolving
in
your
mouth
but
the
flavors
integrate
really
well
unlike
some
mixed
styles
this
beers
flavors
never
clash
and
it
feels
like
the
flavors
were
meant
to
go
together
this
one
really
clicked
for
me
o
a
class
beer
the
bottle
says
tripel
and
ipa
the
beer
straddles
the
two
style
elegantly
leaning
toward
the
body
and
feel
of
a
tripel
while
being
more
inline
with
the
belgian
ipa
in
flavor
and
aroma
the
jury
is
still
out
with
this
one
one
doesnt
know
if
the
beer
is
fresh
or
stall
or
what
i
would
tend
to
thick
they
dont
sell
much
so
im
thinking
its
old
o
pretty
great
will
definitely
try
this
one
out
again
one
of
my
faves
of
the
style
recommended
overall
try
it
a
lot
of
american
breweries
are
putting
out
belgian
ipas
and
this
is
my
current
standard
for
them
o
the
most
unique
ipa
i
have
had
so
far
very
different
from
all
the
other
ipas
i
have
tried
but
it
seems
to
take
the
best
qualities
of
an
ipa
and
tripel
an
awesome
combination
of
american
hops
and
belgian
yeast
one
of
those
beers
youll
never
forget
will
definitely
enjoy
this
brew
again
this
is
a
fascinating
beer
it
seems
to
combine
all
the
best
traits
of
an
ipa
a
tripel
and
a
barleywine
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
also
quite
strong
and
assertive
it
demands
your
attention
yet
also
manages
to
accompany
almost
effortlessly
whatever
you
happen
to
be
doing
it
is
very
complex
yet
still
seems
accessible
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
sometime
it
is
one
of
the
more
enigmatic
beers
i
have
encountered
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
copper
orange
color
with
a
thick
bubbly
head
scent
is
mild
but
has
hints
of
wheat
citrus
and
tame
hops
taste
is
rich
creamy
and
delicious
first
you
get
a
full
flavor
of
citrus
and
wheat
which
then
turns
into
a
slight
bite
of
hops
also
contains
hint
of
banana
within
the
yeast
taste
finishes
slightly
dry
overall
this
is
delicious
and
complex
a
world
class
beer
well
deserving
of
its
rating
houblon

dobbelen
ipa
tripel
pours
a
mildy
hazy
sunshine
yellow
three
fingers
or
so
of
white
foam
rise
up
to
top
the
beer
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
but
neither
particularly
impresses
the
nose
isnt
too
potent
but
it
does
have
some
pleasant
apricotfruity
and
earthyspicy
aromas
the
flavor
is
a
much
better
display
of
the
fusion
between
tripel
and
ipa
that
makes
up
this
beer
pear
and
apricot
stone
fruit
esters
open
things
up
and
fade
beautifully
into
some
more
tropical
fruity
hoppiness
the
bitterness
that
rolls
through
next
is
notable
but
not
overly
aggressive
the
finish
is
the
same
earthy
spicy
noble
hop
note
from
the
nose
im
guessing
courtesy
of
the
saaz
hops
if
a
little
bit
of
a
phenol
presence
could
ave
been
integrated
the
beer
would
be
just
about
perfect
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
simultaneously
the
body
was
a
little
chewy
and
the
carbonation
fell
a
bit
on
the
dull
side
that
aside
houblon
chouffe
is
a
great
belgian
ipa
displaying
the
harmonies
that
can
exist
between
american
hopping
and
belgian
yeast
strains
overall
4
5
this
is
great
right
now
and
if
im
not
mistaken
this
actually
isnt
as
fresh
as
it
could
be
when
its
superfresh
it
can
have
a
bracing
pithy
bitterness
that
almost
distracts
from
everything
else
going
on
right
now
its
balanced
and
has
a
mixture
of
fruity
spicy
pithy
hops
and
an
equally
complex
wellput
together
yeast
profile
meanwhile
the
malt
body
stays
on
the
side
of
bspa
rather
than
tripel
which
suits
this
mixture
of
hops
this
is
just
really
well
done
a
great
beer
very
light
and
quaffable
mouthfeel
for
what
i
expected
to
be
a
cloying
beast
from
dachouffe
overall
this
is
certainly
not
what
i
was
expecting
very
hopforward
with
little
malt
to
back
it
up
would
imagine
this
pairs
great
with
an
array
of
cheeses
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
on
tap
overall
this
wasnt
a
total
hit
for
me
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
overly
yeastspicy
belgian
ales
with
this
much
hop
character
the
flavor
profile
just
clashes
for
me
not
as
off
as
some
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
but
there
are
few
examples
of
this
style
that
really
succeed
in
my
opinion
hazy
straw
color
thin
bubbly
bright
white
head
extremely
floral
nose
sweet
honey
and
eldeberry
upfront
with
bright
tropical
fruits
peppery
clove
and
flowers
honey
suckles
finishes
extremely
floral
dry
and
clean
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
not
a
beer
to
mess
around
with
complex
layers
of
flavors
bold
and
brash
rough
around
the
edges
but
concise
faint
bitterness
lingers
a
bit
lots
of
flowery
hops
on
the
back
end
hoppy
resin
balances
alot
of
these
sweet
belgian
notes
quite
amazing
medium
bodied
carbonation
just
enough
to
be
lightly
prickly
flows
simply
and
quickly
down
leaving
no
coating
but
drying
as
it
goes
overall
what
an
interesting
beer
as
i
pour
the
last
little
bits
into
the
still
mushrooming
cloud
i
watch
the
effervescence
and
nuclear
fission
as
the
liquid
breaks
the
cloud
line
dives
to
the
bottom
and
returns
to
the
cloud
line
joyfully
im
not
even
buzzed
yet
sorry
the
slowly
receding
foam
leaves
a
stickystarchy
residue
on
the
sides
with
only
an
island
left
of
hard
foam
in
the
middle
hard
stuccolike
protrusions
are
still
hanging
off
the
sides
where
the
foam
was
pressed
against
the
glass
while
still
not
a
fan
of
hoppy
brews
im
finding
i
can
drink
them
a
little
more
easily
and
actually
enjoy
some
of
the
better
ones
o
solid
tripel
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
worth
the
price
taste
was
dissapointing
drinks
like
a
5
pilsner
with
barely
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
dissapointing
finish
i
think
this
beer
does
not
travel
well
as
it
is
currently
summer
here
in
the
us
and
the
bottle
is
pale
green
why
oh
why
would
a
brewer
work
hard
than
bottle
in
a
green
bottle
and
send
his
product
12
way
around
the
world
i
would
love
to
try
it
in
belgium
i
bet
its
fantastic
will
try
again
but
my
hopes
arent
too
high
odtook
me
far
too
long
to
try
this
but
i
had
to
drink
some
sort
of
ipa
on
national
ipa
day
great
beer
dont
always
love
belgian
ipas
but
this
is
obviously
a
gem
and
a
legendary
brew
happy
to
have
tried
it
o
im
going
to
seek
out
a
fresher
bottle
i
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
it
was
an
entirely
different
experience
that
said
this
was
still
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
encountered
in
awhile
o
while
its
not
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
ever
had
it
definitely
brings
a
lot
to
the
table
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
o
very
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
i
could
sip
on
this
beer
for
quite
a
while
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
beer
but
it
could
sneak
up
on
you
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
this
one
at
whole
foods
and
scooped
one
up
belgian
ipa
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
one
drank
more
like
a
tripel
there
wasnt
really
a
hop
bite
or
spicy
finish
this
was
a
longtime
want
but
i
was
a
little
bit
disappointed
mostly
full
body
with
a
drying
aspect
medium
effervescence
and
a
slight
warming
after
the
swallow
worth
trying
but
not
buying
a
sixer
of
it
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
orangetan
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
yeast
spice
and
some
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
hoppy
presence
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
wheat
as
well
as
some
grass
and
orange
citrus
notes
the
flavor
is
very
similar
there
is
a
good
bit
of
toffee
and
wheat
as
well
as
some
grass
and
citrus
in
the
flavor
the
bitterness
is
fairly
low
but
the
spiciness
and
yeastlike
character
is
quite
high
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
beer
overall
very
drinkable
nice
balance
and
degree
of
sweetness
the
hops
are
light
but
the
beer
is
nicely
done
otherwise
yellowish
orange
with
sticky
lacing
and
a
head
that
remains
around
the
outter
rim
the
whole
way
down
smells
of
hop
and
fruit
kinda
like
dried
banana
smells
but
good
tastes
of
banana
and
hops
with
great
balance
the
mouth
feel
is
one
of
best
i
ever
had
especially
being
a
belgian
liking
mostly
american
ales
goes
down
so
smooth
ill
have
another
for
sure
love
it
another
pretty
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
little
things
going
on
i
wish
more
american
brewers
beers
would
evolve
into
stuff
like
this
but
at
the
same
time
not
exactly
like
this
we
already
have
this
just
saying
the
taste
is
all
sweet
malt
at
first
i
tried
to
find
any
sort
of
flavor
but
i
get
nothing
no
funk
no
hops
no
yeast
esters
nothing
at
all
super
powdery
sweet
with
nothing
to
accent
it
rather
disappointing
for
what
should
be
and
sounds
like
a
fantastic
beer
i
liked
that
i
was
able
to
review
this
beer
it
is
about
time
damn
i
love
this
completely
outdated
beer
i
have
tasted
it
fresh
on
tap
but
only
in
a
small
sip
time
to
go
back
and
see
what
this
beast
can
do
when
its
hops
are
still
alive
o
good
beer
very
drinkable
overall
drinkability
very
interesting
and
quite
hoppy
but
not
in
a
smash
your
palate
to
nothing
american
way
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
american
ipas
and
dipas
but
this
was
a
nice
change
the
hops
are
the
main
event
with
this
beer
but
they
are
carefully
balanced
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
that
is
more
than
just
sweetness
very
drinkable
had
help
with
the
bottle
but
drank
most
of
it
and
i
know
i
want
more
sips
to
tease
out
more
of
the
flavors
and
to
continue
to
enjoy
all
that
this
beer
is
very
good
and
something
ill
try
to
pick
up
again
this
is
a
fine
ipa
with
belg
written
all
over
it
it
does
not
have
the
maltiness
of
an
american
ipa
or
a
british
for
that
matter
but
has
the
light
effervecent
feel
of
a
belgian
classic
in
that
you
dont
realize
the
alcohol
is
9
but
the
taste
is
clean
yeast
malt
hops
and
alcohol
are
all
balanced
to
present
itself
as
a
wholy
different
packge
this
is
brewing
subtlty
it
is
like
recognizing
a
police
sobriety
block
and
slipping
into
your
jail
cell
and
then
waking
up
at
the
ritz
overall
a
nice
balance
between
citrus
ipa
and
the
belgian
tripel
amazingly
well
balanced
and
well
presented
this
is
actually
less
strange
than
i
expected
it
has
the
heart
of
a
tripel
with
some
ipa
touches
i
would
personally
categorize
this
as
a
tripel
rather
than
belgian
ipa
regardless
its
tasty
o
this
is
fairly
unique
in
terms
of
the
various
components
it
brings
to
the
table
across
the
board
from
the
appearance
to
the
aromas
to
the
flavors
i
cant
say
this
will
become
a
staple
but
i
enjoyed
it
will
explore
the
style
more
and
will
certainly
revisit
overall
this
is
a
really
great
cross
between
belgian
and
american
brewing
traditions
this
is
one
thats
good
but
i
dont
see
myself
revisiting
it
it
might
appeal
more
to
those
familiar
in
the
belgian
ipas
but
im
not
feeling
this
one
much
o
good
drinkable
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
notes

date
on
bottle
drank
on

overall
an
excellent
belgian
version
of
a
style
usually
associated
with
the
states
im
not
one
prone
to
hyperbole
my
students
know
that
though
im
not
a
harsh
grader
i
rarely
ever
hand
out
as
or
as
but
this
is
as
close
to
a
perfect
beer
as
ive
had
the
hazy
goldenyellow
color
and
mediumthick
head
simply
looks
the
way
beer
should
look
inhaling
the
aromas
of
hops
and
hay
makes
one
think
of
a
walk
through
a
wallonian
field
in
spring
im
talking
some
flowersandgrassona
lightbreeze
shit
round
delicious
hops
obviates
any
comparisons
to
nonbeer
flavors
this
ale
tastes
like
ale
and
i
mean
that
in
the
best
way
possible
o
this
is
a
great
one
folks
im
so
happy
that
a
belgian
brewer
is
using
some
good
ol
american
hops
its
really
the
malt
bill
and
yeast
interplay
that
attracts
me
to
belgian
beer
while
its
the
hop
varieties
that
id
describe
as
one
of
my
favorite
parts
of
american
beer
and
this
my
friends
is
a
beautiful
combination
of
those
two
brewing
traditions
o
everything
about
this
beer
is
one
of
a
kind
more
of
a
cousin
than
a
brother
to
the
american
ipa
ive
had
belgium
ipas
that
still
had
many
characteristics
of
an
american
ipa
but
this
should
be
the
standard
for
bipas
i
wish
i
had
tasted
the
regular
la
chouffe
more
recently
or
that
i
had
tasting
notes
to
compare
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
quite
up
there
with
lupulus
or
duvel
tripel
hop
which
for
me
are
the
belgian
ipas
par
excellence
however
still
very
tasty
and
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
this
first
really
nice
day
of
the
year
hazy
straw
colored
well
carbonated
foamy
mountainous
head
awesome
looking
beer
smells
strong
of
floral
soft
hops
most
likely
hallertau
be
sure
to
smell
it
the
moment
its
poured
as
it
dissipates
quickly
bit
more
subtle
than
a
normal
ipa
after
a
while
the
yeast
aroma
really
comes
through
i
dont
give
it
a
5
only
because
of
pungency
which
very
well
have
to
do
with
the
3500
mile
distance
this
beer
traveled
to
my
glass
bitterness
is
solid
and
suiting
doesnt
scorch
at
all
quite
soft
aftertaste
great
grainy
flavors
in
the
body
high
carbonation
lend
a
pleasant
acidity
the
booze
is
remarkably
well
hidden
always
have
and
i
probably
always
will
love
this
beer
really
how
i
learned
to
appreciate
belgian
beers
in
general
oa
delicious
tripel
with
a
nicely
balanced
flavor
on
draft
at
duvel
tasting
room
poured
into
houblon
tulip
small
bubbles
but
huge
white

high
retention
sticky
soapy
lacing
blond
hazy
body
aroma
is
fruity
grapefruity
and
yeasty
awesome
taste
follows
suit
with
the
aromas
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
pairs
well
with
most
any
cheese
btw
the
amarillo
and
tomahawk
hops
add
character
and
potency
to
the
already
impressive
base
while
the
yeast
and
craftsmanship
make
this
more
enjoyable
then
all
but
the
very
apex
of
domestic
versions
of
the
style
doa
overall
a
fine
belgian
classic
a
must
have
for
anyone
who
appreciates
belgian
ales
overall
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
belgian
triple
a
little
dry
for
my
taste
but
quite
nice
none
the
less
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
belgian
ipasfantastically
complex
awesome
yeast
character
and
a
nice
hop
profile
as
well
kick
ass
od
delicious
very
nice
and
simple
to
drink
a
great
belgian
ipa
with
all
the
requisite
flavours
to
make
it
very
memorable
d
this
one
drinks
like
a
decent
tripel
with
some
stale
hops
notes
totally
disappointed
especially
for
the
price
and
the
fact
that
half
of
it
spilled
on
the
counter
o
im
pretty
certain
this
tastes
loads
better
when
fresh
still
this
was
interesting
enough
and
very
drinkable
its
a
belgian
tripel
with
a
solid
hoppiness
o
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
wouldnt
say
its
perfect
but
its
amazingly
good
in
the
bottle
it
tastes
every
bit
as
good
as
a
dryhopped
ipa
on
tap
better
in
most
cases
the
candylike
aftertaste
gives
it
a
character
i
find
appealing
o
simply
a
phenomenal
beer
apparently
its
a
tripel
blended
with
a
belgian
ipa
that
uses
some
american
hops
it
works
incredibly
well
highly
recommended
will
drink
again
overall
delicious
beer
great
style
and
great
flavor
definitely
reccommend
o
really
good
more
flavors
develop
as
it
warms
but
its
refreshing
as
well
as
strong
best
enjoyed
as
a
sipper
dr
highly
drinkable
for
the
abv
in
spite
of
its
mouthfeel
problem
it
features
some
pleasant
flavours
that
are
balanced
well
and
feels
quite
experimental
but
it
never
reaches
a
level
of
being
unique
or
special
i
might
try
it
on
draught
in
belgium
but
its
not
anywhere
near
good
enough
to
consider
paying
a
high
price
for
as
an
import
again
this
brewery
has
better
beers
o
great
belgian
hop
offering
rare
as
they
are
im
not
one
for
hoppy
beers
generally
but
this
is
one
id
be
glad
to
see
show
up
in
my
glass
anytime
although
i
dont
know
that
ill
ever
run
out
and
buy
one
huge
fluffy
head
and
the
fluff
lasts
a
while
scent
is
hops
citrus
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
nice
bubbles
cloudy
taste
is
awesome
hops
taste
really
fresh
for
a
belgian
malty
backbone
good
citrus
hops
hard
to
describe
flavors
except
perfect
ipa
nice
belgian
yeast
flavors
and
wow
these
suds
stick
around
a
long
time
top
notch
and
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
belgian
ipas
i
have
came
across
and
the
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
o
its
an
alright
tripel
lacked
any
hop
presence
for
something
that
is
suppose
to
be
an
ipa
o
3
5
drink
a
very
big
beer
its
highly
peppery
yeasty
and
damp
dank
lemon
i
enjoyed
it
but
really
wish
this
one
wouldve
been
a
smaller
version
ill
probably
come
back
to
this
one
for
sure
o
where
has
this
beer
been
all
this
time
i
have
no
one
to
blame
but
myself
ive
probably
passed
this
on
the
shelf
hundreds
of
times
but
i
finally
decided
to
pick
it
up
and
im
glad
i
did
very
tasty
brew
well
done
o
i
am
normally
not
a
big
fan
of
dipas
but
this
one
has
my
attention
very
very
good
the
body
could
have
been
a
bit
thicker
though
if
you
can
procure
a
fresh
bottle
in
belgium
that
might
be
the
way
to
go
i
wasnt
as
wowed
by
this
bottle
as
i
was
over
there
but
there
still
isnt
much
of
a
fault
in
this
thing
even
after
months
and
months
of
sitting
around
in
transport
and
the
store
shelf
in
a
green
bottle
lots
of
sediment
that
rears
its
head
after
the
first
glass
the
tastes
very
distinctive
of
the
european
tradition
for
this
beer
i
shared
this
with
a
friend
who
thought
it
would
be
similar
to
the
american
ipa
i
had
to
correct
him
but
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
very
wellbrewed
one
there
was
not
any
odd
aftertaste
nor
was
it
too
overcarbonated
as
i
thought
it
run
the
risk
of
being
o
a
very
interesting
beer
and
the
first
actually
belgian
belgian
ipa
ive
tried
definitely
worth
a
try
its
very
cool
to
see
a
belgian
oldschool
response
to
a
style
that
has
become
so
dominated
by
the
west
coast
thebeeralmanac
com
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
a
belgian
ipa
can
accomplish
the
hops
didnt
step
on
the
yeast
and
vice
versa
balance
is
good
but
the
malt
bill
was
solid
and
complimented
the
hops
and
belgian
yeast
well
the
lacing
was
really
extraordinary
and
truly
reminded
me
of
the
lace
hanging
in
the
windows
of
shops
in
brugge
a
great
break
from
the
monotony
of
west
coast
ipas
achouffe
shows
another
flavor
in
the
spectrum
of
ipas
as
a
style
o
one
hell
of
a
beer
from
in
my
opinion
one
hell
of
a
brewery
great
taste
appearance
everything
is
top
notch
here
its
just
so
subtly
outrageous
and
awesome
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
and
is
so
well
received
that
this
is
what
a
brewer
looks
to
achieve
each
time
they
mash
in
a
beer
that
seems
to
be
in
harmony
with
itself
from
start
to
finish
this
is
balanced
and
enjoyable
o
its
ok
and
people
should
try
it
once
but
for
its
price
i
probably
wont
try
it
again
o
a
nice
brew
somewhere
between
a
bpa
and
a
tripel
with
a
decent
hop
showing
o
this
could
be
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
if
the
chouffebrewers
would
change
the
hops
a
tiny
bit
i
am
very
interested
in
that
last
improvement
d
one
of
the
better
bipas
ive
had
great
flavor
good
nose
very
hoppy
throughout
a
good
belgian
that
is
pretty
easy
to
find
go
get
one
o
in
the
end
this
is
a
great
beer
id
910
prefer
a
west
coast
ipa
that
being
said
its
a
really
interesting
amalgamation
of
a
tripel
and
an
ipa
a
touch
too
sweet
for
me
though
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
ale
i
am
happy
i
found
it
at
a
small
little
bottle
shop
by
my
place
i
will
be
picking
some
up
soon
probably
tomorrow
and
the
next
day
and
a
few
day
after
that
its
good
very
unique
beer
with
the
taste
of
tripel
yet
hopped
up
to
an
ipa
feel
the
hops
are
in
balance
with
the
citrus
notes
in
the
tripel
side
of
things
i
found
it
way
too
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
the
whole
beer
had
a
light
handed
touch
to
the
proceedings
almost
a
summer
beer
in
feel
i
will
buy
this
again
as
along
with
de
ranke
xx
this
is
one
of
fave
belgian
ipas
overall
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
this
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
the
flavours
are
not
as
in
your
face
as
i
thought
they
would
be
but
everything
is
well
balanced
and
tasty
my
bottle
says
best
before
end
of
2011
so
maybe
i
should
have
opened
this
a
little
sooner
to
see
if
the
hops
were
more
present
ill
buy
it
again
for
sure
good
brew
the
whole
ipa
tripel
name
threw
me
off
a
little
bit
hard
to
tell
what
style
to
compare
against
either
way
it
is
solid
lots
of
complexity
while
staying
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
is
nice
i
always
take
anything
listed
as
a
belgian
ipa
for
what
it
is
as
a
hop
head
i
prefer
the
american
ipas
the
hops
on
this
beer
are
presant
but
they
are
not
very
aggressive
the
banana
and
passion
fruit
are
more
dominant
than
the
hops
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
pale
than
an
ipa
but
that
is
just
my
opinion
i
am
a
typical
american
that
wants
the
hops
to
slap
me
around
a
little
still
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
drink
always
a
fan
of
dachouffe
pours
a
light
gold
color
w
a
two
finger
white
pillowy
head
excellent
carbonation
and
lacing
very
cloudy
in
appearance
the
carbonation
is
almost
like
a
little
tornado
in
my
snifter
a
life
of
its
own
the
nose
is
lemon
malt
yeast
hops
and
some
clove
not
as
strong
as
id
expect
but
still
a
masterpiece
from
the
smell
it
kind
of
smells
like
a
lemon
dessert
to
me
but
not
too
sweet
taste
is
hoppy
but
also
has
a
huge
malt
backbone
on
it
as
well
everything
on
this
beer
just
works
very
smoothbitter
aftertaste
as
well
overall
this
is
a
really
fantastic
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
huge
monster
head
that
threatens
to
overflow
my
duvel
tulip
body
is
hazy
golden
yellow
that
is
borderline
too
light
smell
is
heavy
on
the
belgian
yeast
bananas
aplenty
lemony
zing
and
juicy

the
juicy
grapefruit
is
quite
prominent
as
well
as
a
dose
of
peppery
notes
and
a
twist
of
banana
good
balanced
belgian
ipa
a
tab
bit
ofheat
hits
the
throat
o
very
well
crafted
belgian
ipa
or
should
i
say
tripel
whatever
you
want
to
classify
it
as
it
is
pretty
amazing
overall
this
is
an
exceptionally
well
balanced
beer
and
it
manages
to
flawlessly
blend
characteristics
of
a
good
belgian
tripel
and
and
an
american
style
double
ipa
fantastic
beer
revised
with
new
tasting
in
dec
2012
m
medium
body
fine
carbonation
and
sharp
bitterness
drinkability
quite
high
ive
had
this
before
from
time
to
time
and
enjoyed
it
but
in
focusing
on
it
for
purposes
of
this
tasting
im
incredibly
impressed
this
is
a
great
beer
o
a
great
tasting
beer
just
a
little
pissed
of
about
the
gushing
o
the
original
belgian
ipa
understandable
why
this
style
has
been
replicated
by
the
likes
of
flying
dog
and
hardknott
goes
well
with
chilli
con
carne
o
even
though
my
tastes
have
changed
over
the
years
this
is
still
pretty
much
the
beer
i
remember
it
to
be
this
was
the
strangest
ipa
ive
had
yet
it
was
the
most
complex
and
didnt
have
the
punch
from
the
hoppy
bitterness
anywhere
its
a
good
beer
but
different
a
tasty
belgian
ipa
and
one
i
remember
liking
more
than
this
variant
on
tap
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
love
both
ipas
and
belgians
and
this
is
a
perfect
combination
of
the
two
the
drinkability
is
high
and
the
taste
is
exceptionable
i
will
be
buying
more
as
soon
as
possible
also
has
one
of
the
best
beer
labels
around
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
i
dont
recommend
this
beer
after
drinking
something
sweet
but
a
solid
ipa
overall
best
ive
had
of
the
style
its
such
a
young
new
style
of
beer
that
i
hope
i
try
better
in
the
future
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
on
top
that
laid
on
top
of
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
colored
liquid
underneath
the
lacing
was
decent
here
leaving
to
scattered
bubbles
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
hoppy
blend
of
an
ipa
and
a
spicy
tripel
the
aroma
had
some
spice
some
hops
and
some
earth
to
it
the
taste
had
a
strong
bitterness
upfront
that
was
mellowed
out
but
the
earthy
spices
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
retty
nice
it
had
a
pretty
good
thickness
to
it
and
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
i
found
this
been
to
be
pretty
good
i
would
drink
this
one
again
side
note
id
be
interested
to
see
what
stonechouffe
could
do
if
they
collaborated
on
a
belgian
ipa
id
love
to
see
that
happen
overall
while
i
like
the
attempt
that
was
made
to
combine
belgian
and
ipa
flavors
in
this
case
the
result
was
less
than
perfect
overall
nice
to
drink
sometimes
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
appropriate
as
far
as
this
style
goes
its
really
the
only
game
in
town
just
the
best
hops
the
product
for
the
product
without
distorting
it
just
the
sublime
a
classic
ipa
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
i
will
be
back
if
i
can
brilliant
simply
brilliant
i
would
bring
this
beer
to
a
party
or
showcase
it
at
a
tasting
the
smell
is
of
belgium
yeast
esters
there
are
some
citrus
hops
the
mouth
is
medium
and
very
carbonated
the
taste
is
harder
to
describe
there
is
some
hoppiness
up
front
there
is
a
little
sweetness
mid
way
maybe
a
hit
of
some
spices
clove
or
cinnamon
some
funkiness
followed
by
some
alcohol
burn
and
a
little
dryness
and
bitterness
as
an
after
flavor
not
nearly
as
much
hops
as
i
expected
this
might
be
about
the
same
level
as
orval
hop
wise
side
note
i
recommend
drinking
this
beer
significantly
warmed
than
the
4045
degrees
that
is
recommended
for
this
style
as
the
second
glass
poured
from
this
bomber
was
infinitely
better
than
the
first
and
is
the
one
i
used
for
this
review
o
good
beer
last
time
for
me
though
pours
a
pale
yellow
nice
frothy
head
and
retention
aroma
of
resiny
pine
hops
and
a
muted
belgian
yeast
fruityness
and
some
lemon
in
the
flavor
a
nice
earthy
bite
from
the
hops
almost
piney
but
not
quite
the
ahtanum
hop
employed
leaves
a
big
bitterness
and
the
earthy
pine
note
pale
malts
and
a
fruity
yeast
presence
alcohol
is
very
light
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
crisp
smooth
and
a
good
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
above
average
belgian
ipa
lovely
stuff
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
color
with
a
tight
white
head
very
sweet
pilsen
malt
aroma
with
a
small
amount
of
hop
pushing
through
surrounded
by
yeasty
fruitiness
seemingly
light
body
for
9with
moderate
carbonation
and
heavy
lacing
citrus
hop
flavors
surrounded
by
candy
sweetness
decent
amount
of
alcohol
warming
at
the
back
of
the
tounge
and
throat
o
drinkability
is
very
good
no
alcohol
is
to
be
found
and
freshness
is
king
the
beer
though
lacks
both
the
complexity
of
a
classic
belgian
strong
ale
and
the
true
bitter
character
of
an
american
ipa
this
is
an
excellent
beer
complex
tasty
and
with
an
active
and
interesting
mouthfeel
it
was
a
pricey
growler
but
i
knew
it
would
be
worth
it
since
finding
this
on
tap
around
here
is
certainly
a
rarity
ive
never
had
bottled
though
ive
seen
it
in
the
store
and
will
make
sure
to
give
it
a
try
to
see
how
it
compares
to
this
beer
on
tap
d
excellent
drinkability
as
i
like
the
combination
of
tripel
spices
with
hops
a
solid
triple
with
extra
hops
was
tested
with
the
bottled
version
were
actually
quite
different
in
taste
the
ontap
was
better
o
extremely
interesting
beer
as
i
am
more
of
a
fan
of
hoppy
ipas
and
esbs
than
tripels
maybe
the
beer
could
have
been
a
little
tighter
with
the
flavors
but
possibly
the
beer
i
had
was
starting
to
pull
apart
flavor
wise
regardless
its
a
recommendable
beer
there
is
a
certain
smoothness
at
first
too
its
almost
like
you
are
drinking
a
fruit
juice
or
something
i
wouldnt
say
thick
but
close
regardless
this
is
a
great
beer
a
wonderful
addition
to
the
1001
bottles
list
and
one
that
i
will
totally
buy
again
i
wonder
if
they
make
this
on
draft
bottoms
up
everyone
overall
i
will
be
buying
this
one
and
the
rest
from
this
brewery
as
this
was
my
first
from
them
as
well
as
my
first
tripel
a
must
try
o
belgian
ipas
have
always
confused
me
a
bit
they
seem
to
be
a
hybrid
of
other
belgian
styles
that
said
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
taste
this
fresh
on
tap
must
try
good
appearance
in
its
houblon
glass
that
i
dont
find
having
the
right
shape
neither
i
like
it
very
much
good
head
even
if
it
does
not
last
very
long
the
goldest
gold
you
can
imagine
on
top
paler
on
bottom
since
the
glass
narrows
smell
and
taste
are
dominated
by
hops
and
it
has
a
dry
bitter
and
tart
finish
i
definitely
dont
like
very
much
probably
thats
the
point
it
has
a
so
hoppy
character
i
cant
deal
with
i
find
its
a
good
beer
and
two
slices
of
gouda
did
the
job
to
finish
it
but
ba
says
generally
belgian
ipas
are
considered
too
hoppy
by
belgian
beer
drinkers
im
definitely
a
belgian
beer
drinker
o
a
great
choice
if
youre
wanting
to
dabble
in
beer
from
belgium
i
was
expecting
to
find
a
citrus
bomb
and
got
a
pleasant
airy
saaz
bomb
i
love
the
springtime
feel
that
achouffe
has
to
their
beers
jd
o
nothing
interesting
about
this
one
i
wonder
if
the
floaties
mean
its
past
its
due
date
or
if
its
just
natural
for
the
beer
to
have
it
also
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
tripel
or
a
belgian
ipa
or
a
dubbel
or
what
definitely
wont
buy
again
overall
if
youre
looking
for
your
typical
outstanding
wellrounded
belgian
tripel
you
need
not
look
any
further
because
it
is
truly
incredible
if
you
see
ipa
on
the
bottle
and
you
are
a
hophound
and
youre
expecting
this
to
resemble
a
typical
american
ipa
with
some
belgian
flavors
mixed
in
thats
not
what
youre
going
to
get
i
love
tripels
so
i
highly
highly
recommend
it
enjoy
o
a
really
nice
beer
from
a
style
that
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
could
be
a
dangerous
beer
as
there
isnt
hardly
any
booze
for
a
9
beer
i
could
definitely
see
me
buying
this
again
or
having
it
at
a
bar
very
nicely
done
i
dont
know
why
this
is
considered
a
belgian
ipa
tastes
like
a
tripel
lemon
grass
flavor
that
is
smooth
to
the
mouth
but
high
carbonation
gets
extremely
better
as
it
warms
you
cannot
even
tell
this
is
a
9
0
beer
not
as
much
hop
characteristics
as
i
expected
although
the
hop
oil
is
visibly
evident
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
wurstküche
in
los
angeles
and
i
remember
the
hop
characteristics
to
be
much
more
evidentmaybe
this
is
because
of
the
bottle
conditioning
maybe
due
to
age
not
as
impressed
by
this
as
i
would
like
to
be
but
then
again
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
still
rated
to
style
though
overall
this
was
a
solid
pick
up
its
tasty
light
and
crisp
definitely
a
venture
out
of
the
typical
ipa
realm
but
not
an
unwelcome
one
edit
and
i
love
the
logo
on
the
bottle
caught
my
eyes
in
the
liquer
store
thats
for
sure
served
on
tap
in
a
stem
glass
poured
a
hazy
yellow
almost
reminiscent
of
a
witbier
citrusy
nose
with
a
bit
of
spice
light
taste
yet
fullbodied
slightly
citrusy
with
a
smooth
hoppiness
that
wasnt
too
strong
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
overall
is
excellent
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
beers
excellent
overall
clearly
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
had
d
4
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
it
grew
on
me
as
i
made
my
way
through
id
like
to
try
more
of
the
style
however
because
it
was
quite
different
from
other
ipas
that
ive
had
maybe
a
fresher
bottle
would
produce
more
of
the
hoppiness
that
i
expected
either
way
a
good
brew
overall
o
i
may
have
just
found
my
favorite
belgian
beer
this
will
go
great
with
a
spicy
dish
like
bbq
or
chili
oa
very
enjoyable
bottle
of
beer
i
picked
this
up
in
nashua
nh
for
something
like
8
99
what
a
deal
when
compared
to
other
750
ml
bottles
at
up
to
4
00
more
theres
a
reason
that
this
is
one
of
the
top
ranked
belgian
ipas
on
the
site
and
thats
because
its
damn
good
i
loved
how
the
fruit
and
spice
notes
from
the
yeast
were
very
subtle
here
almost
to
the
point
where
you
could
have
mistaken
them
for
hop
characteristics
and
the
overall
drinkable
nature
was
very
good
for
the
bigger
size
of
this
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
the
emphasis
on
the
hop
flavors
and
overall
clean
feel
really
won
me
over
here
in
a
big
way
i
think
having
this
on
draft
really
made
a
big
difference
here
cheers
overall
this
is
an
ipa
but
yet
the
hops
dont
make
me
forget
that
its
also
a
beer
a
malt
beverage
great
jobs
to
the
brewery
for
making
a
delicious
beer
and
not
just
catering
to
hopheads
o
im
buying
this
again
id
really
like
to
try
this
with
food
of
that
region
750ml

not

nevertheless
a
solid
brew
overall
notes
everything
is
in
good
balance
with
an
excellent

and
funky

md
light

medium

high

very
easy
drinking
an
interesting
mix
of
the
styles
would
very
much
like
to
give
this
one
another
go
in
the
future
could
this
beer
get
any
better
not
a
chance
its
bone
dry
finish
rounds
out
the
experience
to
make
this
a
beer
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
although
at
9
abv
i
certainly
wont
be
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
time
when
i
can
only
find
750ml
bottles
overall
this
is
too
dry
for
me
and
far
to
strong
for
more
than
a
glass
intersting
though
and
a
good
beer
to
add
to
flavour
experience
journey
poured
into
a
la
chouffe
chalice
the
beer
looked
perfect
a
hazy
golden
body
with
yeast
suspended
within
holds
a
puffy
head
that
reduces
to
a
filim
remaining
as
long
as
the
beer
strong
hop
smells
nice
use
of
tomahawk
amarillo
and
saaz
a
nice
blend
bready
yeasty
smells
produced
among
the
strong
alcohol
esters
the
taste
matches
here
with
the
peppery
phenolics
of
the
belgian
yeast
not
overbearing
a
full
body
with
excellent
carbonation
for
the
level
of
alcohol
and
body
of
the
beer
dont
pass
this
one
in
short
a
belgian
approach
to
ipa
with
perfect
interplay
of
hops
yeast
and
malt
libation
a
fantastic
and
might
i
say
unique
brew
experience
ive
never
had
a
beer
of
this
concoction
that
delivers
so
completely
very
drinkable
even
at
9
abv
and
most
certainly
a
beer
ill
return
to
with
some
regularity
usually
share
belgian
750ml
bottles
but
this
is
one
where
i
do
not
regret
my
greed
nice
to
see
that
the
green
bottle
didnt
let
me
down
too
d
its
got
a
lot
going
on
the
alcohol
is
too
apparent
for
my
taste
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
another
excellent
offering
from
la
dachouffe
the
cpj
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
and
one
i
return
to
now
and
then
but
i
rarely
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
t
light
fruit
flavors
and
a
lot
of
malty
smoothness
finish
is
where
the
hops
come
in
with
a
bit
of
pepper
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
one
but
its
not
terrible
very
well
constructed
and
overall
it
seems
to
be
exactly
what
it
intends
to
be
a
belgian
ipa
tripel
d
good
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
but
was
not
blown
away
would
probably
get
it
again
on
tap
but
wouldnt
pony
up
for
the
big
bottle
again
d
i
wont
be
spending
12
dollars
for
a
bomber
of
this
again
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
palate
a
tasty
belgian
ipa
for
sure
and
the
9
is
nearly
invisible
while
drinking
d
good
ipa
for
a
belgium
brewer
both
styles
tripel
and
ipa
are
wellbalanced
and
its
quite
drinkable
hop
bite
doesnt
linger
too
much
at
the
end
so
its
great
highly
recommend
and
best
for
this
specialty
style
i
really
love
this
beer
every
since
having
it
in
2006
for
the
first
and
even
having
the
opportunity
to
have
it
on
draft
that
summer
at
the
stumbling
monk
in
seattle
it
has
been
a
favorite
do
not
drink
it
as
much
as
i
would
like
because
i
kept
running
into
less
than
fresh
bottles
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
creamy
and
lacy
and
the
carbonation
does
a
good
job
of
keeping
it
that
way
the
whole
way
through
the
sip
drinkability
is
good
in
terms
of
texture
but
the
bananaspice
tastes
get
a
little
bit
too
strong
and
unbalanced
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
in
my
opinion
everything
else
about
it
is
great
though
impression
i
am
now
convinced
i
need
to
try
this
style
freshly
bottled
though
it
may
take
a
trip
to
europe
to
do
it
when
do
we
leave
big
hops
give
the
taste
ofgrapefruit
the
grapefruit
produced
an
interesting
sweet
vs
bitter
contrast
the
high
abv
showed
somewhat
which
is
okay
because
the
beer
remained
balanced
finishes
with
tart
dryness
and
black
pepper
a
tasty
and
unique
beer
that
was
excellent
with
fries
this
was
poured
from
a
11
2oz
bottle
into
my
founders
snifter
and
we
have
a
gusher
that
certainly
wasnt
expected
id
say
i
only
salvaged
about
6oz
of
the
bottle
by
the
time
i
cleaned
it
up
and
a
good
amount
of
foam
remained
in
the
bottle
anyway
it
poured
a
dirty
murky
and
darked
tinged
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
laced
the
glass
like
soap
water
the
aromas
are
very
sweet
yeasty
and
feature
an
ever
so
subtle
light
hoppyness
to
them
its
interesting
to
say
the
least
the
flavor
is
very
yeasty
very
bready
very
malty
and
pretty
sweet
it
has
a
honey
like
sweetness
the
hops
are
pretty
nonexistent
after
the
bottle
bomb
it
has
little
carbonation
left
and
drinks
pretty
smoothly
with
a
light
carbonation
that
tingles
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
just
ok
belgian
tripels
are
just
a
totally
different
style
in
my
opinion
its
a
hard
task
to
perfect
it
and
this
bottle
at
least
did
not
do
that
it
was
solid
just
ok
this
one
smaller
bottle
will
be
enough
for
me
carbonation
is
just
a
little
too
high
for
my
liking
this
is
a
very
interesting
complex
and
good
beer
dthis
is
a
great
belgian
ipa
goes
down
easily
i
wouldnt
mind
having
an
entire
750ml
of
this
one
d
very
drinkable
will
drink
again
d
not
the
best
belgian
ipa
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
not
incredible
d
moderate
drinkability
abv
on
the
high
side
for
the
style
slightly
filling
but
not
overwhelming
flavors
arent
as
potent
as
other
bipas
ive
had
d
medium
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
nice
dense
fluffy
head
served
pretty
cold
which
is
probably
contributing
to
the
fact
that
the
nose
is
reticent
theres
some
light
orangecitrus
white
floral
notes
and
belgian
yeast
not
particularly
hoppy
on
the
nose
for
those
used
to
american
ipasdipas
on
the
palate
this
hits
you
with
a
thwack
of
of
bold
bitter
hops
and
alcohol
the
hops
do
a
nice
job
of
masking
the
9
abv
so
the
overall
impression
is
strength
rather
than
booziness
this
is
fairly
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
refreshingly
clean
and
bitter
unlike
a
lot
of
high
gravity
american
hop
bombs
this
isnt
thick
and
sweet
a
dangerously
drinkable
belgian
ipa
an
odd
mix
of
styles
at
times
i
feel
polarised
within
myself
but
its
at
least
very
interesting
appearance
is
nice
and
smell
is
average
at
first
and
better
as
temperature
settles
into
the
zone
the
taste
to
me
is
very
temperate
and
seems
to
be
better
closer
to
the
50
degree
temperature
impressive
head
and
enjoyable
a
very
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
quite
a
value
at
my
local
store
drinks
well
a
very
nice
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
was
very
drinkable
pours
hazy
gold
with
medium
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
flora
taste
is
complex
fruit
flavors
including
dried
fruit
such
as
raisins
and
prunes
with
nice
and
strong
spicey
hop
balance
strong
hop
bitterness
that
leaves
a
very
smooth
finish
this
is
a
dry
beer
with
the
characteristics
of
an
ipa
but
the
complex
spicyness
of
a
tripel
a
good
belgian
style
ale
but
not
one
that
rocks
me
indeed
i
feel
like
the
extra
hop
additions
are
to
the
detriment
of
the
base
beer
and
not
intense
enough
to
really
rock
the
flavour
spectrum
poured
from
bottle
into
dimple
glass
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
a
nice
mixture
of
fresh
citrus
hops
yeast
spices
and
malt
thats
mainly
bread
and
some
light
citrusish
fruitiness
flavor
is
fairly
strong
but
flavorful
hops
up
front
mellowing
slightly
to
a
dry
yeasty
tartfruity
and
somewhat
spiced
tripel
but
finishing
with
quite
a
few
hops
also
as
advertised
its
a
hopped
tripel
but
somewhat
less
hopping
would
probably
have
brought
out
more
complexity
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
both
americanstyle
and
belgianstyle
beers
cant
say
im
a
big
fan
of
this
one
here
due
to
its
high
rankings
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
hope
to
try
fresh
sometime
i
will
be
buying
it
state
side
in
the
near
future
untill
i
can
make
that
happen
overall
i
was
happy
to
revisit
an
old
favorite
and
it
didnt
disappoint
a
benchmark
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
not
overly
sweet
and
the
dryness
accentuates
the
hops
i
grow
weary
of
these
damn
green
bottles
not
sure
of
the
last
time
ive
had
a
beer
in
a
green
or
clear
bottle
that
wasnt
skunked
in
some
manner
what
a
letdown
d
fantastic
everyone
raves
about
la
chouffe
and
now
i
know
why
mfd
chewy
for
the
style
alcohol
is
well
hidden
except
for
the
nose
smooth
with
low
carbonation
finish
is
of
belgian
yeast
mixed
with
citrusy
hops
d
oh
my
word
do
belgians
even
know
how
to
make
a
bad
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
excellent
beer
randomly
grabbed
this
at
trader
joes
seen
it
on
the
shelf
a
million
times
and
thought
nothing
of
it
until
now
poured
a
murky
golden
yellow
with
pale
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thin
bubbly
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
nice
and
malt
with
some
fruity
character
which
consisted
of
bananas
apple
and
pears
but
didi
have
grassy
hop
notes
as
well
the
taste
was
pretty
yeasty
and
malty
upfront
on
the
palate
wtih
fruity
citrusy
accents
and
a
good
grassy
hop
profile
that
really
surprised
me
from
the
belgians
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
malty
mild
fruity
citrusy
hoppy
slight
bitter
finish
the
brew
surprised
me
for
sure
i
honestly
thought
it
wasnt
gonna
be
that
good
but
was
damn
tasty
and
drank
good
poured
hazy
amber
pour
with
a
large
creamy
white
head
that
lasted
and
had
good
lacing
moderate
yeasty
sour

with
a
smooth
texture
and
soft
carb
onation
full
yeasty
sour
fruity
flavor
with
a
smooth
hop
finsh
of
moderate
duration
good
interesting
brew
d
a
darn
good
beer
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
presence
but
it
works
well
and
drinks
well
for
being
so
heady
the
carbonation
is
rather
mild
gives
a
nice
crispness
a
big
finish
leaving
you
little
depth
to
mask
the
next
sip
oh
so
nice
abv
is
high
but
you
can
neither
smell
it
nor
taste
it
watch
out
though
it
bites
anyway
after
the
citrusy
hops
you
taste
grain
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
yeastiness
good
head
retention
not
quite
duvel
eggwhite
fluff
but
the
similar
all
in
all
similar
to
duvel
green
with
more
graininess
a
bit
thicker
stronger
and
less
fragrant
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
tripel
a
golden
beer
like
a
duvel
had
this
bottle
at
a
moroccon
restaurant
in
san
francisco
i
was
expecting
to
go
with
wine
here
but
apparently
the
beer
list
at
every
nice
restaurant
in
california
is
great
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
colour
with
pillowy
white
head
some
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
strong
citrus
hops
with
the
belgian
tripel
yeastiness
quite
bitter
but
also
the
tartness
of
the
tripel
comes
through
i
love
belgian
ipas
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
for
sure
d
this
is
just
lovely
i
could
drink
this
for
hours
1
bottle
or
multiple
bottles
but
its
too
tasty
to
be
so
patient
or
hasty
d
just
discovered
the
belgian
ipa
format
this
is
one
of
the
best
around
in
that
style
i
encourage
everyone
to
try
this
beer
because
it
has
something
for
everyone
and
will
not
disappoint
everyone
has
to
try
this
beer
there
is
so
much
to
it
its
very
good
too
overall
a
decent
enough
beer
to
try
and
as
the
overall
score
here
shows
i
seem
to
be
in
the
minority
in
my
views
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
pairs
well
with
an
evening
of
conversation
and
music
appreciation
light
hopping
light
body
sweet
a
tad
tart
and
funky
enjoyed
more
with
each
sip
a
real
good
example
of
the
style
only
downside
is
that
its
real
expensive
and
that
definitely
affects
its
drinkability
d
its
good
but
very
bitter
and
grassy
it
think
it
would
be
better
with
a
little
age
on
it
to
allow
the
harsh
hops
to
settle
d
very
drinkable
for
an
abv
that
high
the
hoppiness
doesnt
overwhelm
you
d
this
is
the
best
bipa
i
have
had
including
poperinge
hommel
and
de
ranke
xx
i
was
so
intrigued
and
impressed
at
this
point
that
i
had
to
crack
open
a
duvel
only
for
comparison
i
understand
that
these
are
two
different
beers
but
i
really
wanted
to
see
how
it
stood
against
duvel
in
my
opinion
chouffe
is
a
hoppier
bspa
and
its
a
fair
comparison
i
found
that
while
chouffe
is
more
complex
than
duvel
duvel
is
better
done
but
they
are
equally
good
i
wouldve
liked
chouffe
even
better
had
the
bitterness
seemed
more
in
place
but
thats
perhaps
just
nitpicking
a
fantastic
beer
highly
recommended
i
will
seek
a
fresher
bottle
myself
d
a
wonderful
belgian
ipa
that
is
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
lots
of
yeast
and
spice
in
the
smell
and
taste
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
have
had
a
few
times
and
will
certainly
have
again
overall
a
supreme
example
taste
very
well
balanced
for
how
much
hop
flavor
is
in
this
beer
it
is
hardly
bitter
on
the
palate
the
belgian
yeast
character
and
hop
character
balance
very
nicely
as
well
which
in
some
beers
there
is
a
tendency
to
conflict
i
enjoyed
for
the
first
few
sips
an
intense
spearmint
flavor
which
my
palate
quickly
got
accustomed
to
it
was
absolutely
delightful
a
very
complimentary
complex
and
balanced
beer
light
bodied
beer
with
light
small
bubbled
carbonation
is
good
the
lingering
herbal
hops
on
your
tongue
encourage
you
to
savor
the
lasting
flavor
sipping
this
slowly
and
see
how
it
develops
drinkability
initially
i
was
not
an
ipa
fan
but
more
and
more
i
am
beginning
to
appreciate

is
a
very
good
take
on
a
recent
trend
of
making
very
hoppy
beers
from
traditional
belgian
ale
bases
and
yeasts
the
tripel
was
a
beautiful
but
not
their
best
offering
i
dont
think
there
are
also
some
better
examples
of
the
style
here
in
the
low
countries
makes
you
thirsty
and
behold
theres
a
refreshing
beer
right
in

of
you
plus
the
abv
is
a
fine
motivation
and
also
well

the

nature
of
this
brew
overallnotes
followup
to
my
lachouffe
i
must
say
this
was
the
better
of
the
two
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
its
really
unique
belgian
ipa
hm
ive
got
to
look
into
more
of
these
styles
great
balance
smooth
powerful
flavors
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
i
think
highly
recommended
to
both
the
ipa
and
the
belgian
crowd
d
this
one
is
quite
delicious
and
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
any
fan
of
belgian
beers
or
hop
heads
the
hops
are
tame
but
perfectly
balanced
with
the
belgian
flavours
making
for
a
tasty
beverage
the
only
caveat
is
that
you
enjoy
this
responsibly
as
the
high
abv
can
easily
creep
up
on
you
one
damn
fine
belgian
ipa
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
from
the
tap
looking
forwards
to
trying
this
as
i
never
have
and
have
heard
only
good
things
aboutit
pours
a
pale
murky
golden
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
nice
white
two
finger
head
and
sticky
lacing
here
and
theresuprisingly
enough
i
find
the
smell
of
this
brew
very
subtle
yet
on
the
nose
you
can
still
notice
the
hints
of
belgian
yeasta
touch
of
fruity
citrus
hopspale
malts
and
a
very
pepperygrassy
aroma
of
saaz
hops
aswell
suprisingly
and
they
really
stand
out
on
aroma
its
almost
like
im
about
to
drink
a
nice
german
pilsner
instead
of
a
bipait
has
a
really
nice
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
which
is
well
carbonated
and
very
sessionable
and
so
is
the
taste
of
this
with
touches
of
grassyherbal
saaz
hopspale
maltssome
bananna
and
a
nice
pale
malt
background
which
really
levels
this
brew
out
and
i
suspect
they
may
have
used
saaz
hops
in
this
brew
which
really
makes
for
an
interesting
ipa
of
any
description
as
its
not
in
your
face
at
all
which
i
usually
like
yet
it
is
very
drinkable
and
moreish
and
i
hardly
get
any
bitterness
at
all
on
finish
if
any
and
no
hint
of
its
9
0
abv
even
on
first
taste
and
this
is
my
first
beer
of
the
nightoverall
its
a
really
drinkable
interesting
moreish
brew
that
doesnt
leave
you
gobsmacked
but
makes
its
point
with
a
subtle
mix
of
aromas
and
tastes
and
will
always
have
a
place
in
my

even
reckon
its
probably
a

try

entice

and
focused
but
a
pleasure
to
drink
less
aggressive
than
i
remembered
it
being
but
damn
tasty
after
half
a
glass
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
9
until
the
alcohol
buzz
started
to
kick
in
near
the
end
of
the
first
glass
still
the
more
i
drink
the
better
it
is
well
worth
it
drinkability
is
excellent
for
9
very
crisp
and
refreshing
d
easily
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
to
date
i
would
say
this
is
a
great
belgian
beer
one
of
the
best
in
the
2
mentioned
categories
d
i
was
a
little
shocked
at
first
but
became
more
of
a
fan
with
each
gulp
after
750ml
the
9
had
be
buzzing
but
it
is
very
drinkable
an
interesting
and
attractive
brew
first
pour
turns
into
a
crystal
clear
golden
colour
with
the
second
glass
turning
into
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
some
floaties
in
the
bottom
of
the
duvel
glass
not
as
much
foam
on
the
first
pour
compared
to
the
second
its
like
marshmallows
are
in
my
glass
very
cool
the
taste
is
very
sharp
with
some
piney
hop
bitterness
with
the
yeasty
dark
fruit
taste
lingering
as
well
no
trace
of
the
9
alc
in
this
beer
at
all
goes
down
quite
smooth
would
definately
consider
another
bottle
of
this
d
this
started
off
kind
of
skunky
but
as
it
warmed
and
opened
up
it
got
a
lot
smoother
and
sweeter
it
had
nice
body
and
a
delicate
and
complex
taste
its
more
of
a
sipping
beer
but
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
overall
a
cool
beer
that
has
high
alcohol
yet
retains
a
light
mouth
refreshing
and
crisp
super
drinkable
and
smooth
extremly
enjoyable
beer
d
the
9
abv
nicely
masked
in
this
beer
will
definitely
creep
up
on
you
very
drinkable
for
a
large
trip
ipa
great
depth
awesome
bitter
finish
refreshing
yet
with
a
warm
finish
good
blend
of
styles
very
exceptional
beer
drinkability
devilishly
drinkable
crisp
refreshing
wellrounded
and
with
an
abv
that
is
dangerously
well
hidden
will
revisit
shortly
drinkability
this
is
an
interesting
mix
of
belgian
and
american
styles
and
ive
loved
every
sip
of
it
light
bodied
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
quite
a
complex
beer
with
many
wonderful
aspects
of
the
belgian
brewing
tradition
definitely
a
beer
to
savor
especially
since
the
abv
will
have
you
feeling
good
in
no
time
i
tried
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
before
this
and
there
is
no
comparison
but
i
didnt
expect
there
to
be
the
question
is
do
you
want
a
tripel
with
an
ipa
finish
if
you
do
then
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
have
preferred
a
cleaner
finish
which
spoiled
it
a
bit
for
me
i
understood
what
this
was
a
tripelipa
hybrid
when
i
bought
it
so
can
not
be
too
critical
if
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
want
it
delivers
d
enjoyable
to
drink
although
the
feeling
of
disproportionate
bitterness
wouldnt
make
it
a
session
for
me
tastes
like
hoppiness
sweet
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
crisp
mouthfeel
some
belgian
yeast
flavors
are
coming
though
as
well
ill
definitely
try
this
one
again
poured
from
the
750ml
bottle
into
a
snifter
thick
fluffy
white
head
with
a
straw
coloured
body
bit
hazy
from
the
yeast
smells
primarily
of
hops
bit
citrusy
some
alcohol
esters
some
yeast
nice
head
retention
lacing
is
thick
clumpy
and
sticky
taste
is
quite
hoppy
got
alot
more
of
the
alcohol
as
i
got
closer
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
definitely
the
belgian
yeast
coming
through
also
not
too
bitter
pretty
nice
for
an
ipa
almost
drank
the
whole
750
by
myself
save
a
bit
which
i
shared
but
i
probably
could
have
alcohol
really
stands
out
the
more
i
had
and
detracts
from
the
drinkability
however
overall
my
first
experience
with
a
belgian
ipa
and
was
pleased
however
calibelgique
and
le
freak
are
two
examples
of
this
style
that
i
like
a
lot
more
poured
a
very
light
straw
gold
with
frothy
head
that
died
quickly
but
left
some
lace
patches
a
mix
of
sour
and
tart
fruit
flavors
along
with
a
healthy
hop
presence
and
some
funk
makes
up
the
aroma
a
great
balance
is
in
this
beer
as
this
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
but
contains
a
good
sweet
edge
plus
some
sticky
caramel
malt
also
has
a
good
orangeyeasty
feel
with
citric
hops
for
a
dry
crisp
finish
that
is
bubbly
thanks
to
great
carbonation
a
decent
amount
of
biscuitcaramel
malt
work
their
way
into
the
beer
as
well
and
there
is
also
a
smalle
sourtart
edge
a
great
ale
that
is
easy
to
sip
with
wellhidden
abv
and
is
more
sweet
than
sour
but
still
has
a
good
hoppy
profile
quite
a
drink
easy
to
appreciate
but
offering
lots
eh
its
a
pretty
good
belgian
ipa
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
i
thought
the
amarillo
might
go
further
instead
it
had
more
grass
and
lemon
rind
than
id
prefer
also
surprisingly
boozy
it
looks
incredible
however
including
the
great
11
2
oz
bottle
one
of
if
not
my
absolute
favorite
belgian
ipasi
will
be
buying
this
again
a
hazy
bright
golden
color
pour
with
a
big
lasting
foamy
white
head
leving
lots
of
jagged
lacing
lively
carbonation
aroma
of
bright
citrus
hops
orange
and
lemon
a
little
like
fruit
punch
bananas
and
bread
dough
flavor
is
hoppy
up
front
with
a
nice
toasty
malt
backbone
yeasty
esters
of
banana
and
clove
nice
citrus
hops
nice
level
of
bitterness
a
bit
of
complexity
medium
body
with
a
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
and
a
long
hoppy
finish
very
drinkable
and
good
fresh
houblon
chouffe
on
tap
has
redeemed
the
entire
belgian
ipa
style
for
me
the
bottles
ive
had
in
the
past
must
have
been
too
old
because
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
a
belgian
ipa
to
be
minor
subjective
flaws
and
lack
of
complexity
are
all
that
kept
the
smell
and
taste
categories
from
being
5s
this
was
even
better
than
stone
calibelgique
the
other
belgian
ipa
ive
liked
dont
miss
this
if
you
see
it
on
tap
at
a
trustworthy
bar
d
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
and
drink
it
repeatedly
better
to
do
that
at
home
or
with
a
dd
absolutely
wonderful
brew
a
wellaged
belgian
ipa
i
was
beginning
to
fear
this
style
was
just
not
for
me
paired
professionally
i
need
more
of
this
in
my
life
d
this
can
definitely
hit
your
stomach
with
a
punch
due
to
the
high
carbonation
a
lot
of
this
wouldnt
be
desireable
but
it
is
a
great
beer
to
have
a
couple
off
complimented
with
maybe
a
good
american
ipa
and
a
belgian
tripel
this
was
a
really
unique
beer
not
quite
and
ipa
and
not
quite
a
tripel
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
golden
straw
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
bright
white
head
on
the
nose
i
pick
up
strong
notes
of
damp
wet
hops
and
pine
with
subtle
grapefruit
and
citrus
notes
the
palate
has
notes
of
wet
hops
some
what
reminisent
of
american
ipas
but
with
none
of
the
bitterness
great
carbonation
and
a
mouthfeel
that
reminds
me
of
the
st
bernardus
tripel
overall
a
delicious
example
of
the
style
excellent
in
all
aspects
just
a
bit
prominent
in
terms
of
noticeable
alcohol
d
absolute
great
madness
incredibly
balanced
and
drinkable
i
seem
to
have
run
out
of
superlatives
this
is
the
real
deal
d
tasted
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
than
a
belgium
although
you
can
certainly
pick
up
some
of
the
belgium
yeast
characteristics
underneath
the
hoppiness
still
very
good
and
worth
a
try
but
not
my
favorite
belgium
it
definitely
has
a
strong
taste
so
you
have
to
prepared
to
taste
some
strong
brew
d
exceptionally
well
balanced
with
all
the
traits
melding
together
almost
seamlessly
leading
to
an
extremely
refreshing
beer
without
the
skunkyness
this
would
an
excellent
beer
to
have
quite
frequently
the
balance
and
refreshingness
are
remarkable
for
something
with
9
alcohol
d
the
dryness
the
total
absence
of
alcohol
taste
and
the
not
overpowering
body
makes
it
quite
easy
to
drink
pours
a
nice
honey
golden
color
with
voluminous
thick
white
head
beautiful
lacinghead
great
retention
into
a
little
cap
smell
is
of
clove
with
some
lighter
malts
dancing
in
and
out
maybe
some
banana
too
pretty
light
though
taste
has
some
alcohol
in
it
but
the
clovefruity
tripel
is
nicely
balanced
by
some
slightly
bitter
hops
very
interesting
combination
definitely
what
i
would
envision
a
belgian
ipa
to
be
slight
bitter
finish
light
in
the
mouth
good
carbonation
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
for
9
it
drinks
like
5
delicious
beer
though
a
unique
one
i
feel
like
i
might
not
always
be
in
the
mood
for
one
of
these
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
pale
hops
slight
citrus
sweet
malt
and
slight
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
ipa
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
yeast
slight
wheat
and
hops
overall
good
body
blend
and
appearance
d
this
beer
is
a
classic
and
while
it
is
good
i
do
not
find
it
terribly
interesting
i
have
no
thoughts
on
buying
another
any
time
soon
overrated
in
my
opinion
for
drinkability
if
i
wanted
an
ipa
this
would
not
do
on
its
own
the
beer
is
fantastic
with
lots
of
character
and
great
balance
d
i
wish
this
bottle
wasnt
skunked
again
like
i
said
i
know
some
people
think
that
a
beer
shouldnt
be
reviewed
when
it
has
an
obvious
flaw
but
i
disagree
this
beer
wasnt
that
bad
when
you
look
past
some
of
the
flaws
but
even
under
that
it
just
isnt
that
great
had
a
fresher
version
and
i
have
updated
my
rating
overall
a
very
good
beer
highly
recommended
another
excellent
brew
from
dachouffe
cheers
lighter
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
some
alcohol
is
felt
but
still
hidden
pretty
well
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer

at

though

well
drinkability
overall
a
very
unique
beer
to
me
that
in
most
ways
reminds
me
of
alot
more
of
the
american
beers
i
have
tried
then
most
belgians
if
poured
for
some
of
my
american
ipa
fans
i
am
doubtful
blind
if
many
would
guess
this
as
a
belgian
beer
and
would
mostly
across
the
board
enjoy
this
the
finish
was
long
and
any
hint
of
the
alcohol
being
9
percent
is
extremely
well
hidden
served
as
great
yet
all
be
it
strong
aperitif
and
builds
a
nice
appetite
and
went
tasty
with
some
pizza
one
i
will
have
again
and
recommend
others
try
pours
a
pale
and
hazy

with
a
creamy
and
frothy
white

excellent
retention
smell
is
of
pale
malts
wheat
spicy

and
yeast
taste
is
of
earthy
and
spicy
hops
backed
by
a
nice
spicy
yeast
flavor
pale
malts
come
through
as
the
bitter
flavors
pass
light
bodied
fully
carbonated
prickly
and
drying
a
very
nice
belgian
ipa
maybe
a
tad
thin
and
prickly
for
the
palate
but
the
earthy
and
spicy
notes
were
very
welcomes
after
too
many
resiny
and
over
bitter
hoppy
brews
d
4
5
this
is
my
first
true
belgian
ipa
and
i
must
say
it
is
an
amazing
beer
the
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
i
want
to
drink
more
and
more
of
it
great
brewery
amazing
beer
long
live
belgium
so
impressed
with
this
brew
pours
an
impenetrable
copperyellow
with
a
very
lively
two
finger
white
head
even
when
attempting
to
open
the
bottle
foam
spewed
out
from
the
top
impressive
lacing
the
smell
is
world
class
dominated
by
lemon
zest
yeast
flora
tons
of
banana
and
hay
aromas
are
also
present
ending
with
a
leafy
hop
bite
absolutely
intoxicating
the
taste
is
lively
and
delicious
citrus
lemon
spice
and
banana
with
a
bitter
finish
crisp
light
and
beautiful
sight
malt
as
it
warms
definitely
the
best
of
its
style
im
going
to
stock
up
on
a
few
of
these
monsters
served
in
a
tulip
slightly
hazy
and
golden
with
a
rocky
head
smell
is
very
fruity
and
fresh
with
a
touch
of
spice
aroma
really
reminds
me
of
the
raspberry
bushes
out
in
front
of
my
parents
house
on
our
farm
the
taste
is
quite
complex
fruity
boozy
hoppy
spicy
herbal
quite
bitter
but
the
fruity
yeast
really
dominates
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
dry
but
not
too
dry
finish
the
strength
takes
away
from
drinkability
but
it
is
still
a
tasty
and
interesting
brew
o
strong
bubblegum
alc
too
harsh
like
the
mouthfeel
funk
mild
and
intriguing
notes
a
bit
less
hoppy
than
what
i
was
expecting
that
said
i
still
think
hop
flavors
are
the
main
part
and
attraction
to
this
beer
not
a
hop
bomb
but
rather
a
fairly
balanced
hopcentric
beer
enjoyable
and
definitely
worth
getting
but
not
amazing
d
a
bit
too
sweet
and
a
touch
of
booze
diminished
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
perhaps
the
style
is
just
not
my
thing
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
im
honestly
not
sure
why
this
exploded
maybe
i
inadvertently
shook
the
bottle
around
without
realizing
at
some
point
the
carbonation
was
not
huge
and
the
beer
didnt
taste
lightstruck
it
tasted
excellent
d
crisp
and
easy
drinking
is
the
way
i
could
explain
it
goes
down
easy
despite
the
high
abv
cant
even
notice
them
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
slainte
drinkability
easy
to
drink
delicious
leaves
you
wanting
more
great
beer
d
very
likeable
beer
a
crowd
pleaser
great
drinkablility
very
solid
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
it
is
a
nice
combination
of
two
styles
pretty
drinkable
and
something
i
would
definitely
want
to
have
again
i
recommend
this
one
belgian
ipas
have
a
long
way
to
go
before
they
can
stand
side
by
side
american
ipas
as
of
now
its
no
contest
had
this
one
on
tap
bright
and
clear
straw
colored
beer
fluffy
white
head
with
tight
bead
leaving
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
had
a
nice
citrusy
hop
smell
along
with
that
spicy
belgian
yeastiness
medium
bodied
crisp
and
dry
with
a
good
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
really
nice
chouffe
that
goes
donw
very
easy
considering
its
8
or
9
alcohol
overall
a
very
solid
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
i
liked
this
and
hope
to
have
more
great
smelling
and
tasting
brew
smells
of
a
ton
of
citrus
hoppiness
and
some
spice
taste
has
a
great
mixture
of
hops
with
a
lot
of
citrus
and
spices
delicious
brew
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
finish
is
a
pleasant
pine
resin
complex
and
nice
o
good
not
great
but
good
overall
not
a
bad
introduction
to
the
style
but
it
gets
points
off
for
being
in
a
green
bottle
pours
with
a
mountainous
white
fluffy
head
the
body
is
slightly
golden
amber
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
intense
the
nose
has
a
spicy
peppery
edge
to
it
with
an
underlying
hint
of
alcohol
that
provides
a
warmness
there
is
a
sweet
toffee
wheatiness
that
sit
alongside
a
little
grassy
hop
bitterness
the
first
taste
is
an
almost
yeasty
perfume
bitterness
with
a
slightly
white
wine
dryness
after
this
the
flavours
open
up
and
there
are
more
sweet
malt
flavours
ending
with
a
buttery
flapjack
taste
im
a
massive
fan
of
this
beer
really
love
the
mix
of
flavours
and
aromas
only
weakeness
is
mouthfeel
as
i
felt
this
was
too
carbed
a
little
distracting
but
i
know
many
bottle
conditioned
belgians
can
end
up
this
way
but
this
is
a
great
beer
a
wonderful
gateway
towards
belgians
for
hop
lovers
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
as
ive
been
a
chouffe
fan
since
i
got
into
good
beer
doesnt
disappoint
d
dangerously
good
at
9abv
i
usually
dont
like
the
floralgrassy
hop
flavor
but
what
can
i
say
this
is
an
amazing
beer
a
fantastic
way
to
start
off
my
weekend
d
as
others
have
stated
dangerous
because
of
the
smoothness
and
the
abv
definately
would
want
to
have
this
again
the
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
the
abv
should
be
respected
d
dangerously
high
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
but
catches
you
my
wife
who
had
not
had
a
beer
in
over
9
months
due
to
pregnancy
and
i
split
the
bomber
and
five
minutes
into
the
beer
she
said
whoa
whats
the
abv
of
this
drinkability
is
dang
near
dangerous
at
9
this
is
what
beer
was
meant
to
be
my
2
10
oz
pour
was
probably
the
best
beer
purchase
ive
made
in
a
long
time
f
pretty
dry
and
bitter
it
gets
a
little
more
bitter
on
the
finish
as
they
build
and
hit
at
the
finish
its
a
nice
grassy
earthy
spicy
hop
taste
and
bitterness
that
lingers
a
bit
a
little
alcohol
sting
and
warmth
and
slight
lingering
spice
this
is
a
simply
perfect
belgian
ipa
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
period
lemon
carries
forward
to
the
flavor
as
well
acting
as
a
dilute
sauce
upon
some
fresh
apple
and
pear
and
with
just
a
bit
of
spice
a
slight
coarseness
to
the
texture
provides
for
a
smooth
feel
and
keeps
the
apparent
sweetness
down
the
abv
is
well
cloaked
nonetheless
a
light
bitterness
concludes
after
a
final
flash
of
sweet
lemon
bread
farily
drinkable
given
its
size
quite
pleasant
yet
not
quite
the
showstopper
i
was
expecting
solid
beer
that
is
surely
worth
a
try
more
of
a
hopped
up
tripel
than
an
ipa
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
style
notes
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
cracked
this
open
for
new
years
instead
of
a
bottle
of
champagne
it
was
a
different
belgian
beer
since
not
many
belgians
are
ipas
i
highly
recommend
this
at
9
there
is
little
evidence
of
alcohol
it
is
creamy
and
deceptively
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
but
finishes
a
tad
bit
dry
i
could
drink
this
all
day
drinkability
while
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
i
was
hoping
to
be
blown
away
which
i
was
not
perhaps
i
shall
revisit
this
beer
after
exploring
more
belgian
ipas
out
there
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
was
good
definately
something
that
i
will
try
again
annnnd
this
review
gave
me
my
ba
initiate
mug
so
interesting
who
cares
how
strong
it
is
but
really
its
not
very
noticeable
at
all
until
about
the
halfway
mark
when
when
a
wave
of
boozy
warmth
hit
me
hoppy
flavors
were
stronger
at
first
but
about
halfway
through
im
not
even
thinking
about
this
is
as
a
hopforward
beer
anymore
but
the
bitterness
is
there
when
i
look
for
it
i
will
probably
buy
this
again
just
to
keep
exploring
really
intriguing
drinkability
quite
a
delicious
beer
very
enjoyable
especially
for
anyone
who
enjoys
belgian
style
beers
with
an
extra
hop
kick
pretty
tasty
stuff
but
dont
expect
to
be
bowled
over
by
a
big
ol
grapefruit
incredibly
well
balanced
though
i
actually
wish
it
wasnt
i
think
it
would
work
better
with
a
bigger
amarillo
hop
aroma
reminds
me
somewhat
of
boulevard
saison
i
think
i
prefer
whichever
one
happens
to
be
freshest
at
the
time
d
hig
even
with
the
higher
abv
flavor
is
bright
and
mild
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
relatively
balanced
against
the
belgian
spicy
yeast
character
and
the
malt
this
is
probably
the
best
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
ive
had
finishes
a
little
dry
medium
body
overall
drinkability
high
mouthfeel
high
overall
a
really
good
beer
taste
is
great
and
very
drinkable
not
too
bitter
to
ruin
the
belgian
tripel
taste
a
very
nice
contrast
lots
of
sweetness
that
remains
on
your
tastebuds
well
after
you
finish
a
great
beer
there
was
a
distinct
lack
of
head
but
the
colour
and
all
else
was
the
same
as
the
bottled
version
the
taste
was
very
well
blended
it
was
a
perfect
5050
split
between
a
triped
and
an
ipa
very
smooth
and
refreshing
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
bottle
but
a
bit
more
fragrant
and
explicit
in
the
flavours
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
from
a
solid
brewery
i
am
a
hop
head
that
loves
belgians
so
the
belgian
ipa
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
i
think
helped
put
it
on
the
map
i
have
to
say
though
that
the
urthel
hopit
i
enjoyed
a
couple
days
ago
was
a
clearly
superior
brew
in
my
opinion
i
hate
to
knock
the
brew
but
since
i
had
the
two
in
such
a
sort
period
of
time
its
easy
to
compare
them
still
this
is
definitely
a
tasty
beer
worth
trying
pours
a
massive
hearty
white
head
that
takes
an
eternity
to
diminish
hazy
golden
in
color
aroma
carries
pine
and
citrus
notes
lemon
and
orange
with
hints
of
grass
as
well
taste
is
an
excellent
balance
of
strong
hop
bitterness
early
on
with
a
sweeter
finish
to
follow
an
excellent
beer
all
around
im
learning
to
love
this
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
to
date
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
beer
after
all
of
the
very
excellent
reviews
perhaps
my
hopes
were
too
high
as
i
thought
is
was
a
good
beer
but
not
entirely
excellent
the
hops
balance
well
with
the
sweetenss
and
malt
base
but
the
finish
is
a
little
to
bitter
i
will
try
another
bottle
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
just
a
fluke
but
with
guarded
expectations
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
it
is
certainly
good
very
hop
forward
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
bready
yeast
and
estery
belgian
yeast
proving
a
lot
of
crisp
light
fruit
notes
the
strong
hop
presence
up
front
provides
an
excellent
dry
bitterness
that
lingers
throughout
into
a
long
dry
finish
there
is
also
a
nice
amount
of
citrus
peel
and
grapefruit
from
the
different
hop
varieties
providing
a
lot
of
complexity
strong
bready
yeast
character
comes
through
midpalate
with
some
more
citrus
peel
ripe
banana
and
peppery
spiciness
lots
of
estery
light
fruit
notes
especially
apple
and
pear
add
to
the
sweetness
and
the
abv
is
extremely
well
masked
making
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable
there
are
so
many
different
flavors
bouncing
off
of
each
other
making
this
beer
extremely
flavor
complex
and
quaffable
highly
recommended
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
a
belgian
ipa
so
its
difficult
to
make
a
proper
comparison
to
others
in
the
style
on
its
own
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
with
the
yeast
hops
and
carbonation
the
complexity
is
really
enticing
wish
id
had
a
bit
more
time
to
order
another
one
but
sadly
it
was
time
to
leave
ill
catch
up
with
houblon
chouffe
another
time
for
sure
d
pretty
drinkable
did
nothing
but
improve
as
it
warmed
conclusion
intoxicating
beguiling
heady
and
a
smack
upside
the
head
as
well
what
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
a
must
try
this
is
my
first
i
think
taste
of
the
belgian
ipa
style
and
i
am
enjoying
it
it
is
very
drinkable
despite
its
high
gravity
and
im
really
digging
the
dichotomy
of
hoppyfruity
tastes
and
they
both
are
distinct
and
do
not
step
on
to
each
others
toes
a
solid
beer
and
a
style
in
which
i
will
search
out
more
examples
33cl
bottle
hazy
dark
yellow
with
a
meringuelike
white
head
that
lasts
longer
then
the
beer
and
laces
liberally
fruity
and
yeasty
aroma
with
peppery
spice
and
lots
of
pineapple
the
flavor
has
lots
of
fruit
pineapple
and
citrus
that
seems
to
be
from
the
hops
hop
flavor
is
big
considering
but
the
sweet
fruitiness
definitely
dominates
it
sweet
and
full
with
a
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
hints
at
an
ipa
though
remains
very
belgian
alcohol
presence
is
minimal
full
and
chewy
mouthfeel
with
smooth
but
ample
carbonation
tripels
usually
arent
my
favorite
belgian
style
but
this
has
an
interesting
complexity
and
clash
of
influences
that
makes
it
very
tasty
i
how
an
american
that
is
used
to
ipas
would
find
this
much
more
appealing
than
a
typical
tripel
drinks
like
a
belgian
trippel
tastes
like
a
lambic
but
smells
of
strong
hops
and
bitter
caramel
malt
funkiness
of
the
yeast
comes
through
in
the
end
finishes
smooth
and
sweet
in
the
back
on
the
throat
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
abv
is
well
hidden
making
it
almost
too
easy
to
drink
worth
trying
sometime
if
you
get
the
chance
as
of
tasting
this
beer
is
chilling
at
the
bottom
of
an
illustrious
list
the
top
25
beers
from
belgium
ive
got
a
lot
of
belgian
beers
to
work
through
but
id
say
this
deserves
to
be
there
its
a
belgian
take
on
an
american
take
on
a
british
style
and
it
does
it
well
chouffe

pretty
consistent
eh
bitter

with
a
sweet

was

beer

while
having

this
beer
was
pretty
drinkable

albeit

refreshing
and
drinkable
even9abv
d
good
beer
will
not
buy
this
myself
though
despite
the
considerable
abv
this
is
a
beer
that
lends
itself
to
generous
quaffs
of
hoppy
phenolic
goodness
i
love
it
as
i
pour
the
beer
the
aromas
reach
out
the
body
is
topped
by
a
rather
rocky
head
that
gradually
fades
and
clings
to
the
glass
leaving
rather
nice
sheeting
the
aroma
is
superb
loads
of
sweetness
and
yeast
esters
just
make
me
want
to
continue
inhaling
until
my
nose
starts
to
lose
the
enthusiasm
for
the
new
smells
flavor
profile
is
equally
exciting
great
malt
sweetness
and
a
full
flavor
profile
from
what
must
be
some
awesome
yeast
balanced
by
a
reserved
bitterness
even
at
9
abv
this
is
an
extremely
enjoyable
beer
that
id
like
to
drink
more
of
this
is
great
this
is
a
prime
example
of
what
a
belgian
ipa
should
be
and
not
just
another
version
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
something
i
would
recommend
md
the
palate
is
refreshing
clean
and
moderately
carbonated
visàvis
an
elegant
flavour
profile
while
alc
on
the
palate
is
simply
nowhere
to
be
found
really
this
is
a
wellcrafted
hoppy
tripel
and
not
actually
quite
dipaish
in
any
departments
instead
the
overall
balance
integrity
and
cleanliness
sit
firmly
in
the
belgian
tripel
tradition
imo
and
proudly
so
the
taste
is
a
light
start
with
a
strong
finish
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
ok
the
taste
is
strong
hop
citrus
but
not
strong
bittering
from
those
hops
im
not
sure
why
this
is
as
the
malt
doesnt
seem
to
obtrusive
still
this
is
refreshing
good
light
spices
and
the
hops
makes
this
a
nice
summer
ipa
that
familiar
breadiness
makes
this
a
good
food
beer
perhaps
with
grilled
burgers
an
excellent
belgian
ipa
with
a
dominant
yeast
spiciness
and
enough
sweetness
to
make
things
interesting
this
is
the
second
time
i
try
chouffes
dobbelen
ipa
tripel
i
remember
being
blown
away
the
first
but
it
seems
a
bit
overthetop
the
second
time
around
regardless
its
a
hugely
complex
and
interesting
beer
d
would
be
much
better
without
the
head
but
still
ok
poured
from
bottle
into
a
goblet
pours
a
hazy
dark
straw
color
that
leaves
a
big
fluffy
white
head
this
one
smells
like
a
cross
between
a
tripel
and
a
pilsner
i
think
it
smells
great
fresh
saaz
hop
aroma
followed
by
banana
and
clove
in
the
background
upon
first
taste
there
is
a
strong
peppery
bitterness
as
this
one
warms
up
peppery
taste
is
less
evident
and
a
mild
sweetness
comes
through
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
creamy
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
beer
to
drink
but
not
overly
exciting
i
like
the
idea
of
a
belgian
ipa
but
the
flavors
seemed
to
fight
with
each
other
rather
then
mellow
out
golden
colour
small
white
head
lots
of
lacing
smells
of
grass
straw
and
yeast
although
less
than
is
usual
for
the
style
smells
almost
more
like
a
well
hopped
pilsner
than
a
tripel
flavour
is
also
hoppy
and
is
also
reminiscent
of
a
pilsner
more
than
a
tripel
although
the
yeastiness
is
there
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
average
with
small
crisp
bubbles
overall
more
interesting
than
well
tasting
i
dont
join
the
hype
but
it
is
still
worth
a
try
notes
i
know
that
my
profile
lists
the
irs
as
my
favorite
style
but
seeing
as
how
deciding
between
that
the
dipa
and
the
belgian
tripel
was
like
splitting
hairs
it
really
means
nothing
having
said
that
i
knew
i
was
going
to
like
this
beer
because
it
combines
two
of
my
favorite
styles
but
damn
this
is
a
grandslam
of
a
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
its
as
impressively
hoppy
fruity
spicy
alcoholic
dry
and
scrumptious
as
i
was
hoping
for
and
then
some
im
not
exactly
wellversed
in
belgian
ipas
but
one
thing
is
for
sure
this
one
is
my
favorite
of
all
the
ones
ive
tried
so
far
highly
recommended
nice
triple
not
to
harsh
but
could
use
a
bit
of
mellowing
not
much
of
an
ipa
imho
just
not
hoppy
enough
to
qualify
for
me
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
i
would
definitely
classify
it
as
a
hoppy
tripel
before
i
would
call
it
an
ipa
or
a
double
ipa
this
was
actually
a
very
good
example
of
a
style
that
has
not
worked
for
me
so
far
had
a
really
good
ipa
flavor
not
too
much
hops
not
too
much
belgian
character
good
golden
color
great
carbonation
very
good
at
this
abv
its
really
a
double
ipa
but
very
drinkable
at
that
abv
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
massive
white
head
smells
phenolic
and
like
alcohol
taste
is
earthy
bitterness
a
hint
of
spicy
belgian
yeast
and
a
sweet
malt
middle
finish
is
dry
and
sharp
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
high
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
this
is
a
good
beer
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
though
especially
considering
the
average
rating
of
this
beer
is
an
a
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
would
not
consider
it
great
imo
drinkability
very
its
sweet
yes
and
that
can
drag
in
the
longer
run
of
things
but
this
quenched
my
thirst
in
every
way
and
then
some
very
very
awesome
summer
beer
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
of
in
the
very
near
future
highly
recommended
i
poured
the
last
bit
of
the
bottle
into
the
glass
to
see
what
would
happen
now
its
cloudy
with
bits
of
yeast
floating
around
not
much
difference
in
taste
except
perhaps
for
a
touch
more
sweetness
be
very
careful
in
pouring
this
one
as
it
has
a
tendency
to
overfoam
if
not
poured
slowly
also
if
you
happen
to
see
this
beer
on
tap
i
would
highly
recommend
you
get
it
drinking
it
out
of
a
bottle
is
almost
nothing
compared
to
it
on
tap
its
like
comparing
a
plain
chicken
filet
to
a
chicken
club
sandwich
its
got
the
bacon
and
cheese
only
metaphorically
and
that
bacon
and
cheese
is
all
it
needed
to
be
absolute
perfection
the
beer
had
medium
body
and
was
sort
of
creamy
pretty
bubbly
as
well
all
in
all
it
went
down
nice
and
drank
the
whole
750
in
one
sitting
no
problem
drinkability
is
decent
the
alcohol
and
overlycarbonated
mouthfeel
do
hinder
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
aside
from
that
the
brew
is
quite
good
nicely
proportioned
with
a
hop
quality
that
works
quite
well
with
the
belgian
yeast
cheers
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
slightly
gritty
light
and
effervescent
very
drinkable
excellent
tripel
not
sure
if
i
could
even
say
it
can
be
identified
as
an
ipa
although
the
hops
are
definitely
more
prominent
than
most
other
belgian
beers
this
stuff
is
great
drinkability
this
is
great
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
had
yet
its
still
not
perfect
thoughthat
brief
unpleasant
bitterness
on
the
back
gets
a
little
old
overall
though
the
marriage
of
ipa
and
tripel
works
well
in
that
its
a
nice
balance
of
imbalance
if
that
makes
sense
as
i
eatdrink
the
last
chunk
of
fluffy
head
from
my
glass
and
look
at
my
empty
bottle
im
sad
that
i
dont
have
more
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
is
a
big
beer
for
sipping
but
its
just
about
right
for
a
little
dutch
cafe
d
if
you
find
this
on
the
shelfs
even
with
the
whimpy
gnome
on
the
label
you
must
be
on
the
wrong
website
if
you
dont
first
buy
it
and
secondly
drink
it
and
thirdly
enjoy
it
to
sum
it
up
buy
this
one
d
nice
but
not
great
definitely
would
not
turn
one
down
note
the
draft
version
seems
to
me
to
be
a
bit
more
harsh
showing
some
alcoholic
flavors
moreover
the
carbonation
is
less
refined
and
mouthfeel
isnt
as
good
this
one
is
definitely
superior
in
the
bottle
though
on
draft
its
still
quite
good
d
moderately
low
to
moderately
high
this
is
9
so
watch
out
still
for
us
hop
heads
this
beer
takes
beloved
hops
in
a
new
direction
without
compromising
the
integrity
of
the
essential
hop
flavor
we
all
know
and
love
truly
a
great
beer
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
made
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
would
have
liked
a
little
bit
more
of
a
bitter
hop
taste
to
it
as
the
alcohol
definitely
undermined
the
hop
presence
of
the
beer
one
finger
spongy
white
head
on
an
opaque
soft
golden

spotty

on
the

decent

is

sweet

heat
is
noted
with
an
excellent

perfect
carbonation
on
the
pallet
easy
to
drink
a
tasty
belgian
ipa
probably
the
most
americanstyled
of
the
belgian
ipas
in
a
good
way
smells
of
lemon
citrus
a
level
of
grassiness
and
herbs
plus
a
hint
of
spice
i
almost
thought
it
was
going
to
be
like
a
wiezen
or
saison
because
of
the
light
and
refreshing
aroma
taste
is
great
lemony
and
grapefruit
with
mixes
of
several
hops
and
a
bit
of
citrus
and
fruit
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
refreshing
feel
tingles
with
carbonation
and
ends
with
a
slight
bitterness
interesting
but
seems
a
little
bit
like
its
just
some
type
of
blond
or
tripel
with
some
extra
hops
thrown
in
for
the
heck
of
it
a
bit
of
a
chimera
yet
it
works
not
outstanding
but
its
also
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
and
very
fine
for
what
it
is
and
when
all
is
said
and
done
id
tuck
it
in
under
an
ambitous
tripel
thats
worth
revisiting
drinkability
is
dangerous
on
this
one
the
9
could
get
you
in
trouble
with
no
hint
of
alcohol
at
all
although
i
am
filling
up
quickly
with
the
heavy
carbonation
knock
out
offering
will
seek
out
again
drinkability
i
may
have
found
a
new
favorite
i
could
easily
do
a
session
with
a
few
of
these
even
though
its
a
higher
abv
its
easily
drinkable
and
very
tasty
excellent
it
smells
soft
some
spice
a
small
amount
of
hops
as
well
sipping
this
beauty
of
a
beeri
taste
grapefruit
banana
yeast
and
again
that
faint
dash
of
hops
mmm
the
taste
leaves
you
yearning
to
sip
again
why
not
the
mouthfeel
is
well
balanced
and
not
overpowering
no
bitter
or
dry
aftertaste
whatsoever
drinkability
is
exceptional
and
you
would
be
unlikely
to
assume
this
clocked
in
at
an
abv
of
9
if
you
had
not
been
privy
to
that
information
ahead
of
time
a
great
beer
with
a
clever
marketing
schtick
d
could
use
a
few
more
hops
but
overall
a
damn
tasty
belgian
overall
a
fantastic
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
t
david
the
gnomes
finest
hour
if
youre
expecting
something
similar
to
a
west
cost
ipa
prepare
to
be
disappointed
but
if
you
want
a
tripel
with
a
little
extra
kick
this
is
the
beer
for
you
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
tried
i
was
expecting
to
think
that
its
overpriced
at
9
25
for
a
750ml
but
i
dont
i
would
happily
pay
this
much
for
a
beer
this
good
i
could
easily
drink
two
of
these
back
to
back
though
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
to
because
of
the
abv
this
is
the
best
ipa
ive
had
so
far
in
my
experience
with
the
style
on
an
after
note
i
poured
the
rest
of
the
bottle
in
my
pilsner
and
it
foamed
over
bad
i
would
always
pour
it
at
45
degrees
and
not
let
up
at
a
90
at
the
end
or
you
will
get
the
drink
on
the
floor
table
alloftheabove
for
that
i
bumped
my
appearance
up
0
5
taste
is
very
smooth
grain
corn
sour
malt
hops
in
the
back
a
little
citrus
banana
pear
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
a
little
dry
d
wow
this
is
refreshing
an
idyllic
summer
brew
but
watch
your
back
as
its
9
abv
can
quickly
catch
up
with
you
when
you
are
under
the
blazing
sun
mouthfeel
nothing
to
complain
about
sharp
carbonation
and
a
thinner
body
than
you
would
find
in
a
american
ipa
of
this
strength
11
2oz
brown
bottle
instantly
foamed
over
the
top
of
the
bottle
when
opened
quickly
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
where
a
murky
golden
tangerine
ale
was
revealed
with
large
amounts
of
particulates
suspended
throughout
fluffy
offwhite
head
towers
over
the
rim
of
the
glass
and
is
not
quick
to
dissipate
eventually
leaves
sticky
chunks
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
side
of
the
glass
at
first
i
did
not
find
it
appetizing
to
see
all
the
particulates
but
the
stickiness
of
the
lacing
won
over
the
look
of
this
one
aromas
were
of
fruity
belgian
yeasts
with
hints
of
spice
mixed
with
the
familiar
scent
of
hoppy
citrus
tastes
dance
on
the
palate
as
the
different
aspects
interchange
belgian
yeast
grapefruit
mandarin
orange
maybe
rind
with
notes
of
spiciness
from
both
the
belgian
side
and
the
hop
profile
alcohol
is
well
concealed
although
still
present
finishes
tart
bitter
and
dry
this
is
nicely
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
a
new
style
for
me
and
one
i
would
try
again
d
fantastic
belgianinspired
ipa
with
equal
and
impressive
parts
tripel
and
ipa
definitely
one
of
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
to
date
the
beer
seemed
to
get
drier
as
the
tasting
progessed
and
the
final
third
pour
glass
was
a
lot
more
hoppy
than
the
first
two
so
the
sediment
must
be
heavy
in
the
hop
department
this
is
a
grand
beer
but
not
as
simple
just
bitter
as
other
belgian
ipas
that
i
have
had
before
d
lipsmacking
good
im
really
getting
into
ipas
with
belgian
yeast
and
this
was
a
fine
offering
what
a
ale
drank
the
whole
750
ml
bottle
quickly
and
felt
like
openning
another
overwhelmingly
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
beers
even
though
it
is
really
a
belgian
influenced
by
american
style
hop
profiles
what
a
keeper
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
d
very
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
hefty
9
abv
this
stuff
pours
a
cloudy
golden
some
of
the
sediment
got
mixed
up
during
transport
but
it
works
the
aroma
isnt
so
great
but
once
they
change
those
bottles
from
green
to
brown
i
expect
that
to
go
away
the
flavor
is
the
biting
bitterness
from
the
hops
both
the
europ
and
american
varieties
the
stuff
does
have
a
warm
mouthfeel
that
tastes
pretty
boozy
but
the
dryness
balances
this
out
drinkability
this
turns
out
to
be
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
but
with
the
9
abv
it
could
easily
sneak
up
on
you
and
thump
you
across
the
back
of
the
head
ill
definitely
want
to
have
more
of
this
beer
but
only
one
portion
at
a
time
pour
is
like
few
beautiful
and
with
a
nice
head
of
bone
white
with
a
condensing
head
turns
to
cotton
candy
in
about
five
minutes
nose
of
belgian
sugar
cane
honey
malt
and
candied
pineapple
taste
is
more
extravagant
honey
pollen
very
mild
musky
saaz
bitter
fruity
orange
juice
lemon
zest
pineapple
but
more
so
applesauce
hops
are
clean
but
the
beer
is
sweet
ill
be
honest
to
say
i
dont
like
it
out
of
the
tap
too
thin
too
sweet
and
mild
muskiness
is
in
the
bottle
the
sweet
is
nice
but
it
takes
away
from
the
beer
when
the
range
of
flavor
is
put
on
the
chopping
block
i
will
be
honest
as
to
say
that
i
dont
know
what
would
make
this
beer
a
better
example
of
its
style
besides
a
milder
sweet
d
ehhh
i
finished
my
first
glass
and
ill
finish
the
bottle
but
this
wont
be
something
i
will
bother
with
holy
calamity
is
this
thing
soft
medium
body
with
prickly
at
first
refreshing
carbonation
that
quickly
becomes
very
soft
that
really
sticks
to
your
teeth
and
tickles
your
gums
d
an
outstanding
brew
in
all
facets
abv
is
well
hidden
sophisticated
easy
drinking
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
and
over
again
d
two
of
my
favorite
styles
ipas
and
belgian
tripels
blended
into
one
fine
elixir
highly
drinkable
and
extremely
enjoyable
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
one
ontap
for
a
while
now
and
finally
came
across
it
at
the
charlotte
flying
saucer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
nice
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
frothy
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
slight
lacing
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
crisp
earthy
hops
and
spice
the
taste
seems
to
lose
a
bit
without
the
benefits
of
bottle
conditioning
the
hops
spice
and
sweet
malts
are
still
there
but
not
as
profoundly
as
from
the
bottle
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
some
alcohol
presence
this
one
seems
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
other
belgians
such
as
saison
dupont
that
are
much
better
from
the
bottle
i
can
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
top
5
belgian
ipas
on
the
site
good
balance
of
the
sweet
grassy
hops
meets
the
presence
of
malts
and
belgian
yeasts
to
give
off
that
slight
funk
that
i
find
to
be
intriguing
and
not
at
all
distasteful
definitely
a
world
apart
from
most
american
ipas
ive
tried
because
this
beer
overpowers
your
palate
with
a
multitude
of
subtle
flavors
rather
than
just
the
brunt
force
of
hop
bitterness
this
is
much
smoother
while
still
offering
those
bright
grassycitrusy
hop
aromas
and
flavors
to
enjoy
this
is
a
beer
unquestionably
worthy
of
an
a
wow
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
belgian
ipas
so
far
body
is
heavier
than
i
expected
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
super
creamy
and
smooth
pretty
easy
drinker
d
a
very
good
beer
but
something
was
just
missing
the
taste
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
the
nose
and
overall
id
say
that
i
definitely
prefer
piraat
to
this
one
d
its
an
interesting
complex
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
keep
coming
back
this
beer
is
a
solid
package
all
the
way
around
from
the
beautiful
head
through
the
smooth
well
balanced
delivery
the
pleasant
bitter
finish
and
the
carbonation
i
would
happily
drink
this
all
afternoon
this
beer
pours
a
nice
yellow
with
much
sediment
with
a
large
head
that
takes
a
while
to
go
down
it
smell
very
refreshing
and
spicy
it
tastes
very
hoppy
and
has
a
bite
to
it
this
is
a
very
distinct
taste
not
your
usual
ipa
but
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
d
the
carbonation
slows
you
down
a
bit
with
this
beer
and
thats
just
what
you
need
with
a
surprisingly
quaffable
9abv
belgian
ipa
tripel
bottom
line
try
this
beer
if
you
have
not
i
dont
care
how
much
it
costs
you
try
it
d
a
very
unique
and
drinkable
version
of
an
ipa
quite
inspiring
actually
i
really
liked
this
beer
in
the
bottle
i
do
think
it
is
nearly
perfect
on
tap
however
ill
have
to
seek
it
out
again
on
tap
and
update
my
review
until
then
ill
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
i
found
it
very
drinkable
slightly
filling
and
high
abv
will
keep
you
from
plowing
thru
it
d
i
had
2
of
them
last
night
but
i
couldnt
have
a
3rd
drinkability
suffers
some
from
the
hoppiness
for
me
and
the
sweetness
its
just
a
big
beer
and
i
can
only
have
a
couple
of
these
max
typical
heavy
body
for
the
belgian
ale
hoppiness
really
adds
a
little
to
the
mouthfeel
off
the
pour
has
strong
carbonation
that
settles
to
minimal
at
the
end
of
the
glass
typical
for
belgians
pretty
good
drinkability
just
gotta
watch
yourself
with
the
alcohol
go
out
and
get
this
one
now
in
short
belgium
is
weird
theres
a
gnome
on
this
bottle
and
im
not
sure
i
understand
what
theyre
going
for
with
the
beer
also
i
hate
gnomes
a
crisp
and
refreshing
but
also
spicy
tripel
a
good
amount
of
hops
add
a
citrus
characteristic
to
the
belgian
style
recommended
mouthfeel
is
crisp
well
carbonated
and
with
a
dry
finish
intriguing
and
very
complex
beer
absolute
masterpiece
d
i
really
liked
this
one
it
manages
to
blend
a
rather
aggressive
and
bold
hop
character
with
the
sweet
fruity
and
yeasty
character
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
in
a
great
way
highly
recommended
d
i
tend
to
lean
more
towards
the
hoppier
american
ipa
styles
but
i
thought
id
give
this
belgian
style
a
try
i
am
a
big
fan
of
other
belgian
styles
particularly
golden
ales
this
ipa
isnt
one
that
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
isnt
bad
im
glad
i
tried
it
the
high
abv
would
probably
limit
most
beer
fans
to
one
or
two
of
these
but
it
seems
like
a
fairly
wellrounded
beer
and
representative
of
the
style
foam
head
everywhere
extremely
foamy
even
opening
after
warming
for
a
bit
very
cloudy
golden
body
big
foamy
white

somewhat
lasting
belgian
flowery
aroma
some

slight
amount
of
alcohol
some
spices
watery
taste
light
flowery
taste
some
spice
weakish
for
9
very
light
flavor
watery
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
as
far
as
the
ease
with
which
this
stuff
goes
down
what
keeps
it
from
being
too
drinkable
however
is
the
fact
that
its
9
and
that
a
11
2
oz
bottle
clocks
in
at
about
four
and
a
half
bones
otherwise
this
shit
is
straight
out
of
sight
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
belgian
style
ipa
i
have
had
to
date
very
crisp
clean
hoppy
and
refreshing
not
to
mention
super
drinkable
great

note
to
self
ranked

when
i

it
d
very

how
this

masks
the
saaz
very
drinkable
each

gives
you
a
little
something
else
well
i
liked
this
even
though
im
lukewarm
to
tripels
the
hoppiness
is
more
evocative
of
a
pilsener
like
bohemian
lager
than
it
is
of
an
american
ipa
i
suppose
thats
because
it
uses
saaz
hops
worth
trying
at
least
once
d
excellent
example
of
the
style
a
true
belgian
ipa
i
had
this
once
quite
awhile
ago
and
just
revisited
it
now
the
nose
is
bursting
with
floral
citrus
hops
its
a
gorgeous
pour
straw
gold
in
color
cloudy
and
with
a
great
puddinglike
head
that
lasts
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
juicy
and
very
easydrinking
the
flavor
i
dont
want
to
gush
so
i
wont
but
if
i
did
id
say
wowww
its
loaded
with
citrus
honey
pine
white
pepper
and
nicely
malted
great
balance
i
didnt
detect
the
alcohol
so
much
so
this
went
down
way
too
easily
received
as
a
gift
for
christmas

i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
a
nice
complex
fun
ale
to
experience
in
good
company
i
really
liked
the
diverse
hop
notes
and
complexity
body
is
mediumlight
plenty
of
co2
in
solution
and
drinkable
refreshing
and
light
which
is
misleading
given
the
abv
not
too
bitter
or
sweet
palate
offers
an
interesting
balance
of
background
malt
with
citrusy
sweet
hops
and
the
light
fruitiness
of
the
yeast
is
at
play
also
nice
balance
and
complexity
without
being
hit
over
the
head
with
any
particular
component
of
the
experience
long
juicyfruit
finish
and
again
very
fresh
clean
d
solid
belgian
take
on
the
ipatripel
i
like
piraat
a
tad
better
the
taste
is
fruity
upfront
i
suppose
from
the
belgium
yeast
with
background
notes
of
citrus
its
well
balanced
tart
and
tangy
on
the
tongue
very
clean
refreshing
brew
extremely
drinkable
almost
dangerously
so
overall
the
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
with
tremendous
amounts
of
flavor
overall
i
just
started
getting
into
belgian
ipas
a
little
while
ago
and
have
tried
a
handful
but
this
is
they
very
best
ive
had
a
must
try
for
hopheads
and
belgian
fans
alike
notes
from
42706
d
a
wonderful
ipatripel
hybrid
something
id
like
to
see
more
attempts
at
the
bottle
was
very
easy
to
finish
and
if
i
had
it
i
could
see
myself
going
for
another
one
very
nice
i
had
no
interest
in
having
a
second
one
i
like
tripels
i
like
ipas
i
dont
think
they
mix
well
or
maybe
they
would
with
more
earthy
hops
instead
of
the
citrusy
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
to
a
degree
but
considering
the
competition
in
its
class
id
probably
spend
the
money
on
something
else
slightly
above
average
for
its
style
but
one
can
find
better
brews
out
there
d
due
to
its
tartness
crisp
carbonation
and
upfront
bitterness
i
thought
this
beer
was
quite
drinkable
i
mean
its
not
as
easily
quaffed
as
a
session
ipa
but
with
9
abv
thats
to
be
expected
i
reluctantly
finished
this
expensive
bottle
i
had
high
hopes
this
would
be
something
like
a
belgian
meantime
very
disapointing
drinkability
is
incredible
for
a
9abv
beer
incredible
beer
drinkability
this
one
was
fun
it
lived
up
to
its
hype
and
i
would
drink
it
any
chance
i
got
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
i
had
this
on
tap
at
high
street
grill
it
was
presented
in
a
chimay
goblet
the
beer
is
a
clear
yellow
with
a
moderate
white
head
mild
lacing
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
citrusy
hops
a
background
of
spicy
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
was
mildly
sweet
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
bitterness
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
it
went
down
very
easily
with
my
belgian
endive
salad
even
though
this
is
a
hybrid
style
i
felt
this
was
more
ipa
than
tripel
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
so
deceptively
delicious
that
i
had
not
idea
what
the
abv
was
its
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
as
the
palate
is
wiped
clean
begging
for
more
after
every
sip
this
does
not
scream
ipa
to
me
the
owner
of
6
save
said
its
more
popular
with
their
hopheads
i
didnt
find
it
overly
hoppy
the
hops
are
a
refreshing
breezy
prelude
to
that
sweet
creme
brulee
center
that
i
loved
d
i
half
expected
this
to
be
a
dipa
in
the
traditional
american
super4c
hops
tradition
but
these
belgian
madmen
have
taken
the
hop
craze
to
a
whole
new
level
this
is
one
of
the
strangest
brews
ive
ever
had
though
not
quite
as
oddball
as
rauchbiers
and
roggenbiers
i
would
totally
pick
this
up
again
its
a
nice
treat
to
take
a
vacation
from
the
endless
stream
of
ipas
porters
stouts
pale
ales
amber
ales
brown
ales
and
other
blah
brews
this
unique
brew
takes
it
to
the
edges
of
the
brewing
envelope
having
said
that
this
is
a
big
drink
great
for
one
but
the
alcohol
starts
to
really
come
through
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
the
belgian
ipas
are
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
style
of
beers
you
get
the
belgian
triple
style
with
a
nice
healthy
dose
of
hops
whats
not
to
like
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
of
triple
flavors
and
hops
without
being
to
aggresive
i
will
happily
drink
this
one
on
many
more
occasions
cheers
this
is
an
inspired
beer
poured
from
a
750cl
bottle
into
a
chimay
glass
very
cloudy
chunky
unfiltered
golden
liquid
fluffy
cloud

head
on

a
handsome

smell

yeasty
and
fruity
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
summer
fruit
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
going
down
nice
aftertaste
i
only
regret
that
i
lost
about
a
third
of
this
chilled
bottle
when
i
opened
it
i
had
not
shaken
it
and
i
was
very
careful
opening
it
the
gnomes
share
i
guess

this
beer
is
great
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
interesting
beer
definitely
a
blend
of
two
worlds
tastes
sort
of
like
what
it
is
a
belgian
pale
with
hops
however
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
mug
of
beer
as
it
would
be
something
to
try
but
not
something
i
would
drink
again
drinkability
is
incredible
all
around
one
of
the
hoppiest
yet
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
the
balance
and
extreme
flavors
make
this
brew
awesome
in
every
way
im
glad
my
local
just
got
a
case
in
now
i
will
really
be
able
to
enjoy
it
for
a
couple
months
at
least
this
brew
doesnt
exactly
jump
off
the
shelves
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
one
available
to
me
i
cant
believe
ive
never
seen
this
beer
in
pittsburgh
from
the
label
i
expected
a
confused
beer
trying
to
be
too
many
things
at
once
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
fine
brew
i
found
it
pleasant
drinkable
and
a
smooth
combination
of
flavors
not
usually
found
in
the
same
glass
d
ive
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
the
several
times
ive
encountered
this
beer
it
has
been
shared
with
friends
during
tastings
and
this
one
is
always
the
best
of
show
the
hybrid
style
seems
to
appeal
to
the
best
of
both
the
ipa
and
triple
crowd
and
both
camps
will
be
very
happy
poured
a
semi
hazy
yellow
golden
color
with
a
huge
super
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
citrusy
yeasty
and
a
fruitiness
especially
pear
and
apple
now
this
is
interesting
never
had
a
belgian
ipa
before
tastes
like
a
typical
strong
pale
beligian
but
with
hops
not
super
hoppy
though
just
enough
i
dunno
this
is
kinda
weird
but
i
think
i
like
it
might
be
the
bunk
ass
cheese
i
had
before
this
feel
is
kinaa
slick
and
sticky
with
some
carbonation
tingly
drinkability
low
i
dont
find
this
enjoyable
i
poured
it
out
and
will
be
complaining
to
the
guy
who
recommended
it
to
me
he
often
refuses
to
sell
beers
he
thinks
are
too
old
so
i
dont
think
this
was
a
skunked
bottle
t
velvety
smooth
all
throughout
lots
of
lemon
at
the
beginning
which
lasts
through
the
taste
a
nice
tartness
kicks
in
around
the
middle
with
some
bitter
malts
and
finishes
yeasty
but
nicely
d
so
easy
too
easy
drinkability
i
was
a
little
leery
at
first
but
this
combination
works
incredibly
well
having
imparted
the
finer
points
of
both
the
tripel
and
the
ipa
into
its
flavor
profile
md
i
expected
the
beer
to
feel
more
carbonated
than
it
did
the
beer
was
smooth
and
crisp
very
drinkable
and
one
that
i
will
most
certainly
pick
up
again
d
an
interesting
hybrid
a
triple
to
be
sure
but
with
these
fantastic
bitter
undercurrents
i
cannot
think
of
many
beers
i
like
better
than
this
pours
a
yellowy
cloudyunfiltered
straw
color
with
pillows
of
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
floral
with
a
nice
hoppy
smell
of
citrus
in
the
background
the
taste
follows
right
along
with
everything
from
hops
to
yeast
and
spice
just
a
fantastic
beer

faves
d
this
is
a
great
belgian

and
definitely
my
favorite
so
far
the
hop
bill
is
pretty
impressive
on
this
belgian
beer
this
really
seems
to
combine
my
favorite
ipa
and
bspa
aspects
well
to
make
for
one
awesome
beer
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
when
i
see
it
d
great
drinkability
despite
its
intensity
a
very
sophisticated
brew
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
light
amber
with
a
23
fingered
head
and
tons
of
lacing
the
smell
is
of
citrus
the
taste
has
some
orange
zest
flavors
some
grapefruit
all
coming
from
the
hops
with
a
wonderful
malt
base
to
contrast
to
the
huge
hop
flavor
a
wonderful
example
of
balancing
huge
hop
flavors
with
beautiful
malt
bases
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
just
a
little
overcarbonated
for
my
liking
the
only
thing
that
hurts
the
drinkablility
is
the
carbonation
level
as
for
a
9er
this
is
an
incredibly
easy
beer
to
drink
a
wonderful
layered
beer
massive
foamy
head
crisp
hops
with
orange
slices
balanced
by
a
bit
of
dough
and
a
fairly
malty
finish
malty
but
not
cloying
excellent
mouth
feel
with
plenty
of
carbonation
that
seems
to
release
the
flavor
without
distracting
from
it
very
drinkable
which
is
a
bit
dangerous

the
body
is
moderate
with
a
somewhat
sweet
finish
a
bit
hard
to
pick
out
with
the
bitterness
some
soap
finish
notes
but
ok
overall
the
hop
notes
are
a
little
off
specifically
bittering
hops
would
like
a
drier
finish
overall
and
some
cleaner
malt
flavors
but
still
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
pours
hazy
gold
with
an
uncontrollable
white
head
big
white
and
rocky
it
always
exploded
out
of
the
glass
with
the
slightest
pour
the
hop
aroma
is
nearly
identical
to
any
english
ipa
the
yeast
and
spice
are
there
but
drowned
out
the
same
goes
for
the
flavor
bitter
soapy
and
waxy
with
more
wood
pepper
and
pine
than
sweet
citrus
some
esters
and
tripellike
spice
in
the
end
but
unremarkable
its
a
good
beer
with
a
big
identity
crisis
dsurprisingly
enough
extremely
easy
to
drink
does
not
way
you
down
and
alcohol
does
not
make
its
presence
known
hardly
at
all
unbelievable
the
abv
is
exceptionally
well
hidden
in
this
dangerously
drinkable
brew
nicely
carbonated
medium
bodied
very
crisp
in
taste
and
feel
d
for
a
belgian
and
at
9
pretty
good
theres
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
with
some
good
carbonation
the
hop
spicyness
really
leaves
my
mouth
dry
though
the
alcohol
is
virtually
undectable
in
this
one
too
im
glad
i
spent
the
money
on
this
one
overall
it
is
drinkable
certainly
an
unusual
beer
that
is
a
good
thing
since
it
makes
it
interesting
but
it
is
also
a
bad
thing
since
the
various
flavors
didnt
quite
work
for
me
didnt
blend
well
the
sweetness
was
too
strong
picked
up
a
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
with
a
huge
foamy
head
almost
made
me
think
i
did
a
bad
job
of
pouring
the
head
lingered
for
quite
some
time
smells
of
yeast
and
hops
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
spice
not
an
overwhelming
aroma
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
texture
tastes
a
bit
hoppy
and
bitter
and
the
spice
and
fruit
is
subtle
its
a
smooth
and
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
presentation
of
this
beer
besides
the
gushing
there
were
little
particles
floating
throughout
the
glass
nice
beer
to
contrast
to
the
typical
american
ipa
counterpart
750
ml
bottle
acquired
via
trade
pours
out
an
insane
amount
of
foamy
white
head
every
pour
fills
about
70
foam
a
light
orange
color
the
aroma
is
pretty
light
lots
of
rich
malts
and
some
spices
the
flavor
is
interesting
like
a
belgian
strong
ale
combined
with
a
ipa
lots
of
spices
yeast
and
some
citrus
but
also
a
bitter
hop
finish
the
alcohol
is
fairly
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
full
quite
nice
but
not
amazing
drinkability
not
my
favorite
of
their
offerings
no
need
to
have
it
again
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the

hops
yeast
buttercream
honey
and
some
barnyard
taste
of
tart
citrus

leaf

toasted
dough

alcohol
and
heavy

d
while
im
failing
to
notice
the
9
abv
its
not
my
sobriety
that
will
keep
me
from
reaching
for
another
but
my
tastebuds
themselves
all
said
and
done
a
pretty
unique
beer
one
that
i
probably
will
revisit
a
few
times
a
year
when
i
see
it
on
tap
i
guess
belgian
ipas
arent
quite
my
thing
overall
another
delicious
brew
from
the
great
brewery
the
empty
bottle
now
sits
longingly
next
to
my
garden
gnome
in
the
vain
attempt
to
scare
off
snails
donce
was
enough
im
sure
there
are
some
out
there
that
would
love
to
sit
with
this
one
all
day
but
not
me
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
one
of
the
hoppiest
belgians
ive
ever
consumed
for
sure
and
something
i
will
surely
have
again
i
would
have
smoked
this
even
more
but
im
trying
hard
to
be
fair
despite
being
pissed
that
im
still
wiping
beer
off
me
and
the
rug
i
would
rate
this
as
one
of
the
better
triple
or
belgian
pale
ales
i
have
had
well
this
is
certainly
a
high
alcohol
beer
the
flavor
doesnt
hide
it
at
all
is
it
more
ipa
than
tripel
yes
in
fact
id
go
on
the
record
as
saying
this
has
all
the
elements
of
an
ipa
and
only
the
smells
of
a
tripel
interesting
if
ultimately
forgettable
notes
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
this
is
just
so
easy
to
drink
a
wonderful
concoction
and
something
i
really
looked
forward
to
having
the
taste
is
just
so
unique
world
class
brew
from
where
elsebut
belgium
the
mouth
is
thick
and
creamy
the
viscosity
of
this
one
leaves
a
mouthcoating
aftertaste
for
days
those
really
must
have
been
floaters
in
there
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
carbonation
medium
to
full
bodied
d
this
one
tastes
strong
prefer
the
urthel
hop
it
but
still
a
great
beer
love
the
style
superior
partner
to
some
mussels
poured
into
my
chalice
this
hazy
golden
liquid
produced
a
nice
white
two
fingered
head
an
eruption
of
bubbles
flow
from
the
bottom
of
my
vessel
to
the
surface
the
smell
of
hops
along
with
belgian
yeast
are
the
first
sign
that
you
have
a
unique
beverage
in
your
hand
nice
sweet
taste
up
front
than
the
presents
of
some
spice
and
fruit
white
pepper
then
the
finish
of
the
piney
hops
a
brew
just
begging
for
another
sip
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
those
little
bubbles
dancing
around
your
tongue
a
pleasure
to
drink
served
in
a
750
ml
delicious
very
surprising
and
fruitful
the
brew
dances
on
the
palette
wonderful
to
have
a
belgian
ale
that
is
ipa
rocknroll
style
this
is
what
will
turn
me
unto
a
belgian
drinker
if
there
is
any
it
looks
a
beautiful
cloudy
pale
wheat
good
looking
brew
the
smell
is
delectable
it
got
my
nose
too
close
and
i
was
not
cross
aside
from
the
have
sip
lost
the
taste
stays
with
you
fruity
and
well
rounded
with
an
aftertaste
that
sticks
to
the
gums
a
true
fine
wheat
taste
i
could
drink
it
all
day
well
a
good
two
but
would
need
a
mixitup
definitely
drinkable
for
two
to
a
few
but
wouldnt
feel
comfortable
drinking
all
night
a
must
try
for
sure
its
hard
to
drink
the
keystone
light
and
pbr
after
this
but
it
is
too
good
to
follow
it
with
a
home
brew
mine
are
really
good
this
is
a
great
beer
buy
it
try
it
and
enjoy
yourself
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
great
belgian
here
but
like
them
all
probably
would
have
to
limit
oneself
d
pretty
drinkable
for
the
bitterness
and
complexity
d
drinks
rather
easily
given
its
9
0
abv
could
have
probably
2
or
3
then
would
be
a
little
too
soused
to
want
to
keep
enjoying
its
a
nobrainer
that
if
you
like
belgian
and
belgianstyle
beers
and
you
like
american
ipas
you
should
try
this
i
feel
that
its
the
eccentric
cousin
of
the
american
ipa
worth
a
try
at
least
very
full
mouthfeel
and
very
little
alcohol
make
this
a
great
beer
to
drink
hard
to
believe
it
is
9
abv
d
this
is
a
big
spicy
hoppy
beer
the
flavors
are
robust
and
hard
to
ignore
especially
the
grapefruit
hop
flavors
reinforced
by
the
wheat
sourness
certainly
not
a
session
beer
but
a
complex
and
very
interesting
beer
that
would
go
great
with
seafood
or
maybe
even
dessert
notes
this
is
certainly
a
high
hops
beer
and
it
you
like
that
then
you
may
love
this
beer
it
is
certainly
superior
to
other
hopped
up
beers
that
i
have
had
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
overall
this
was
one
hell
of
a
belgian
ipa
tons
of
citrus
and
hop
flavors
that
i
will
be
getting
again
ill
be
back
for
more
very
good
very
drinkable
beer
well
balanced
a
very
interesting
new
beer
experiment
well
done
at
9
abv
and
alcohol
warming
does
not
make
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
a
nice
experiment
of
combining
a
belgian
beer
with
hop
aromas
and
flavors
very
very
nice
loved
this
beer
one
of
my
new
favorites
overall
dont
be
afraid
its
really
nice
d
at
9
0
abv
one
can
only
take
so
much
but
let
there
be
no
doubt
i
could
swirl
down
one
of
these
1
pt
9
4
ounce
bottles
with
no
problem
as
long
as
im
sitting
down
wow
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
huge
soft
white
head
that
wont
end
really
pretty
beer
smells
belgian
very
spicy
lemons
some
grassy
hops
taste
is
similar
i
liken
this
more
to
a
tripel
than
an
ipa
i
get
some
hop
bitterness
with
the
spicy
belgian
yeast
taste
but
not
as
biting
as
the
de
ranke
xx
bitter
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
9
abv
glad
to
split
with
a
friend
but
could
finish
a
bottle
alone
i
dig
it
its
in
my
little
black
book
of
go
to
brews
d
went
down
nicely
had
a
12oz
pour
and
i
could
have
had
more
really
nice
still
i
feel
this
is
better
in
the
bottle
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
had
this
on
tap
and
this
was
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
the
first
time
that
being
said
there
is
a
huge
variance
between
bottles
as
well
overall
i
deeply
love
american
ipas
and
am
a
big
fan
of
belgian
ales
too
i
thought
i
would
enjoy
this
one
more
than
i
did
it
seemed
less
a
cross
between
styles
and
more
its
own
form
altogether
still
its
a
tasty
beer
drinkability
absolutely
no
alcohol
note
but
you
can
definitely
feel
it
afterwards
this
is
a
truly
an
outstanding
and
complex
beer
and
ranks
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
you
really
cant
knock
it
for
too
much
and
stylistically
its
spot
on
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
if
you
enjoy
the
two
styles
not
overly
strongly
resembling
either
style
but
an
excellent
clash
of
the
two
one
heck
of
a
drinkable
beer
too
much
so
probably
if
it
wasnt
9
0
abv
i
would
have
a
new
sessioon
beer
very
delicious
brew
but
the
abv
a
limiting
factor
obviously
another
quality
showing
from
brasserie
dachouffe
could
drink
this
any
day
of
the
week
and
look
forward
to
the
next
time
d
this
beer
showcases
the
unique
balance
between
a
very
strong
ipa
and
a
very
special
belgian
tripel
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
finish
is
dry
carbonation
is
low
and
is
perfect
for
this
beer
body
is
mediumlight
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
one
that
id
not
be
opposed
to
drinking
all
night
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
one
up
again
very
soon
i
think
ill
go
with
the
750
and
keep
it
colder
than
38
f
when
i
open
it
hopefully
therell
be
less
chance
of
a
gusher
d
nice
to
sip
on
great
beer
all
around
d
very
smooth
and
spicy
in
nature
making
for
a
very
interesting
drink
a
definite
try
there
is
alot
going
on
behind
a
beautiful
seductive
appearance
a
billowing
bright
white
storm
cloud
head
grows
on
top
of
a
foggy
dark
orange
abyss
an
aroma
of
flowers
chamomille
bitter
peels
and
honey
suckle
carry
away
the
senses
initial
hit
taken
is
peppercorn
and
the
wind
is
knocked
out
of
me
second
attempt
reveal
bitter
flower
stems
and
peels
behind
the
spice
oil
streams
carry
herbs
downstream
to
paradox
bittersweet
complexity
is
key
translating
this
one
into
words
is
a
bit
of
a
struggle
whoa
a
trippy
beer
that
can
take
you
on
a
magic
carpet
ride
of
flavors
from
beginning
to
end
gorgeous
looks
of
golden
lions
mane
with
a
big
fat
head
that
makes
the
brew
look
picturesque
strong
scents
of
hops
wrestling
with
orange
peels
and
cloves
interrupts
the
match
for
a
quick
clothesline
on
this
great
acid
trip
of
taste
you
will
glide
through
orange
groves
sail
the
7
seas
with
captain
hops
have
some
lemonade
with
the
mad
hatter
talk
with
the
chouffe
in
a
field
of
cloves
and
arrive
back
home
eating
a
peanut
butter
and
chocolate
sandwich
hours
later
as
if
nothing
ever
happened
is
it
all
a
dream
or
is
that
the
9
0
abv
playing
tricks
on
you
the
alcohol
bite
is
there
and
then
not
there
depending
on
what
taste
you
concentrate
on
a
brilliant
illusion
in
this
hall
of
mirrors
so
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
lewis
carroll
creation
of
a
brew
drinkability
it
is
a
great
beer
the
combination
of
these
two
styles
are
awesome
m
lively
carbonation
helps
promote
the
bitterness
promotes
the
scent
to
be
notices
while
drinking
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
good
belgian
beer
crafting
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
that
ive
ever
had
from
our
belgian
friends
di
would
like
to
always
have
one
or
to
of
these
around
cause
when
the
itch
comes
nothing
goldenyellow
color
white
lacey
head
smells
of
banana
sweetness
and
spice
i
found
that
both
the
smell
and
taste
are
affected
by
which
point
you
are
drinking
from
the
bottle
if
it
has
been
cellared
upright
at
first
opening
it
has
a
light
banana
spice
smell
much
like
that
of
a
belgian
pale
but
those
scents
mingle
with
a
breadiness
and
citrusy
grapefruit
as
you
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
beer
has
an
exceptional
balance
of
flavors
with
a
tripel
style
sweetness
belgian
spice
and
hop
backing
the
same
flavors
also
create
an
interesting
refreshing
moutfeel
the
saaz
hops
create
a
mineral
astringency
on
the
sides
of
the
tounge
while
the
amarillo
adds
a
warming
bitterness
to
the
back
of
the
throat
and
the
light
fruit
sweetness
cools
the
palate
plenty
of
flavors
mingling
with
nothing
overpowering
as
i
continue
to
pour
this
and
near
the
bottom
of
this
bottle
flaky
yeast
and
haziness
accumulates
adding
breadiness
grapefruit
bitterness
also
increases
toward
the
end
of
this
bottle
a
beautiful
fairly
complex
yet
very
drinkable
brew
with
no
noticeable
alcohol
content
cloudy
and
lumpy
pale
orange
with
a
huge
white
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
smells
tripely
its
all
about
candy
and
light
caramel
it
smells
astringent
which
isnt
a
big
surprise
in
a
belgian
and
darn
it
it
has
an
astringent
flavor
to
it
as
well
it
tastes
like
a
cross
between
a
hop3
and
a
really
astringent
belgian
sweet
floral
hops
a
little
bitter
in
the
end
id
think
that
without
the
astringency
it
would
be
awesome
drinkability
as
a
phenomenal
tripel
this
one
more
than
holds
its
own
against
the
best
of
its
style
so
well
rounded
and
easily
sipable
belgian
brewing
at
its
best
d
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
extremely
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
this
would
be
even
better
on
tap
opinion
this
is
a
really
nice
tripel
i
am
not
sure
exactly
where
the
ipa
reference
comes
in
except
that
there
are
some
american
citrusy
hops
used
in
the
beer
rather
than
european
hops
other
than
the
fact
that
i
dont
get
the
dry
bitterness
that
you
expect
from
an
ipa
and
i
am
glad
that
isnt
the
case
btw
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
extremely
drinkabledangerously
drinkable
its
such
a
refreshing
and
seemingly
sessionable
ale
all
around
very
tasty
pours
a
murky
bright
yellow
with
a
hugh
beautiful
persistent
head
that
just
doesnt
go
away
aroma
is
mostly
herbal
hops
saaz
is
the
dominant
varietal
in
nose
the
bottle
says
saaz
is
one
of
the
hops
used
there
are
also
some
citrusy
notes
in
the
aroma
as
i
begin
to
drink
this
the
citrus
aroma
is
definitely
coming
out
more
oranges
taste
is
fairly
sweet
it
definitely
has
that
tripel
malt
character
must
be
the
yeast
there
is
that
distinct
belgian
phenolic
and
spicy
flavor
but
its
the
hops
that
are
the
real
story
here
mostly
citrusy
american
hop
character
oranges
again
definitely
a
more
herbal
noble
hop
note
is
present
as
well
pretty
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
finishes
somewhat
dry
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
dangerously
drinkable
this
is
the
first
belgian
ipa
ive
tried
and
im
definitely
a
fan
everything
works
together
incredibly
well
in
this
beer
awesome
stuff
md
nothing
wrong
here
its
good
it
was
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
since
i
didnt
think
the
belgian
yeast
character
would
mesh
well
with
increased
hops
but
it
actually
worked
ok
bitterness
was
fairly
low
but
the
taste
and
aroma
of
hops
were
increased
to
make
for
a
nice
experience
interesting
affordable
worth
a
look
if
you
can
get
it
d
awesome
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
can
definitely
see
grabbing
several
more
bottles
of
this
overall
despite
the
bottle
nearly
exploding
on
me
it
ended
up
tasting
great
very
nice
hybrid
type
beer
that
i
would
gladly
purchase
again
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
it
coats
the
palate
quite
nicely
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
im
glad
i
shared
the
bottle
with
my
wife
and
a
friend
i
wouldnt
have
wanted
the
whole
thing
its
quite
filling
bought
in
to
my
store
sold
half
a
case
in
one
day
pours
with
an
obscenely
huge
white
rocky
pederasts
head
and
lacing
lots
of
sweet
honey
and
fresh
pie
with
caramel
then
blended
on
puree
is
very
smooth
and
delicious
another
beuty
from
the
chouffers
broccoli
heads
poured
into
the
best
available
wine
goblet
this
beauty
poured
a
light
yellow
gold
color
a
bit
clouded
with
a
big
white
frothy
head
and
solid
lacing
the
aroma
is
wheaty
citrus
with
a
surfside
freshness
salt
air
sweetness
the
flavor
brings
on
more
of
the
same
with
some
bubblegum
highlights
and
light
citrus
over
a
mellow
sweet
malt
kind
of
grapey
fair
drinkability
nicely
carbonated
a
pleasant
viscosity
very
nice
fairly
unique
stuff
from
my
experience
my
thinking
was
that
too
much
hopping
would
diminish
the
complexities
of
the
belgian
yeast
this
can
be
true
in
some
beers
not
in
this
one
this
one
nails
it
to
produce
an
excellent
beer
it
took
a
few
years
but
im
hooked
upon
warming
a
bit
the
smell
hasnt
changed
that
much
as
i
should
have
figured
though
this
tastes
much
more
like
a
belgian
pale
than
an
american
or
even
british
ipa
lots
and
lots
of
spicy
yeast
very
little
alcohol
zing
or
burn
strong
nodes
of
spicy
european
hops
end
things
out
no
huge
complexity
no
giant
burn
of
hopiness
but
its
wonderfully
balanced
and
tastes
great
interesting
combination
of
styles
hoppiness
not
quite
what
id
expect
for
an
ipa
finish
out
a
little
drier
to
improve
drinkability
this
beer
was
tasted
in
a
wine
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
rocky
off
white
head
that
holds
wonderfully
and
laces
incredibly
obviously
the
belgian
yeast
and
massive
hops
combine
for
this
wonderful
head
the
smell
is
full
of
belgian
yeasty
spiciness
and
citrusyspicy
hops
very
nice
aroma
here
the
taste
is
up
front
with
hop
bitterness
again
citrusy
and
spicy
hops
a
nice
fruity
and
spicy
hop
character
with
a
toasty
malt
character
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
a
nice
way
to
combine
a
tripel
with
an
ipa
pours
an
effervescent
golden
hue
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
mountains
up
to
the
top
of
the
snifter
as
the
head
recedes
it
leaves
thin
tiny
bubbles
thickly
laced
in
spotty
patterns
across
the
walls
of
the
glass
smell
is
intense
ripe
pear
green
apple
orange
juice
banana
white
pepper
and
clove
taste
isnt
quite
as
intense
as
the
nose
however
it
is
very
balanced
and
very
unique
in
a
good
way
begins
with
sweet
banana
bread
and
transitions
into
a
citrus
orange
zest
with
a
tongue
tingling
peppery
finish
the
alcohol
slowly
warms
the
back
of
the
throat
but
is
never
overbearing
everything
balances
everything
out
no
doubt
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
glass
the
champagne
like
mouthfeel
certainly
helps
melt
it
all
together
and
dance
it
across
the
taste
buds
thanks
to
ba
member
onslow
our
local
brew
stocker
for
ordering
and
letting
us
know
that
he
had
it
this
beer
is
superb
i
like
the
hoppiness
and
how
the
belgian
influence
takes
a
backseat
give
this
a
try
definetly
md
mouth
feel
is
really
light
and
dry
from
the
high
carbonation
but
if
anything
this
makes
the
drinkability
really
easy
and
smooth
notes
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
and
was
slightly
let
down
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
an
aldebaran
but
got
an
overly
sweet
as
opposed
to
overly
hoppy
brew
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
on
tap
mouthfeel
is
initially
slick
moderately
carbonated
but
finishes
dry
and
crisp
and
tingly
pretty
drinkable
but
i
expected
some
juicier
hops
drinkability
an
unseasoned
palate
of
mine
might
not
have
appreciated
this
as
much
a
merryfeeling
combo
of
two
good
styles
thumbs
up
for
the
guys
in
the
ardennes
a
good
beer
tasting
pick
for
palates
in
the
know
taste
is
crisp
and
citrusy
almost
soda
poplike
and
really
refreshing
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
and
a
solid
herbal
bitter
hoppiness
that
balances
the
sweet
fruity
brew
contributing
mightily
to
topnotch
drinkability
this
beer
actually
has
some
heat
as
im
finishing
this
fine
unique
belgian
ale
im
feeling
some
heat
this
is
some
spicy
beer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
nice
big
white
head
with
a
great
lacing
color
is
cloudy
tangold
smells
like
a
belgian
floral
beer
very
interesting
a
definite
bitter
floral
smell
of
hops
is
present
taste
is
a
slightly
bitter
hop
flavor
hops
are
slightly
citrus
tastes
very
good
fairly
balanced
even
with
an
emphasis
on
the
hoppy
profile
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
but
i
just
let
it
sit
and
sip
on
it
while
swirling
it
overall
this
is
very
nice
good
drinkability
drinkability
way
to
really
jazz
up
the
tired
old
tripel
style
guys
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
strawyellow
with
an
enormous
white
fluffy
head
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
was
the
distinct
bubblegum
sweetness
of
belgian
yeast
the
taste
was
more
of
that
distinct
belgian
yeast
sweet
and
fruity
but
also
with
a
hefty
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
blended
in
as
well
a
nice
complement
to
the
candy
sugar
sweetness
a
bit
fizzy
mouthfeel
but
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
into
a
snifter
huge
fluffy
three
finger
head
lasts
for
days
leaving
a
thick
sheet
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
sediment
comes
in
the
last
third
of
the
bottle
clouding
the
brew
like
crazy
nose
is
sweet
fruits
spice
and
citrus
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
tripellike
with
sweet
fruits
sugar
the
hops
bitterness
hit
towards
the
end
creating
an
interesting
balance
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
insanely
drinkable
the
9
doesnt
show
at
all
a
very
unique
very
tasty
brew
one
to
ne
sought
out
for
sure
big
thanks
to
goodbyeohio
for
hooking
me
up
a
truly
spiritual
experience
chouffe
is
a
godsend
i
couldnt
imagine
enjoying
drinking
a
beer
any
more
than
this
if
i
were
to
ever
meet
the
brewer
i
would
most
certainly
need
to
give
himher
a
thanks
a
handshake
and
a
hug
thank
you
goes
down
like
water
is
the
major
complaint
real
smooth
where
id
like
a
beer
this
good
to
make
some
resistance
on
the
way
down
the
hop
character
here
is
downplayed
sort
of
has
this
nice
mix
of
spice
and
light
hops
and
belgian
sugar
sweetness
incredibly
fresh
tasting
beer
refreshing
amazing
the
body
is
silky
smooth
with
perfect
carbonation
this
was
my
first
experience
with
this
style
but
this
was
fantastic
a
fantastic
hybrid
between
belgian
and
american
brews
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
for
a
while
and
i
had
really
no
idea
what
to
expect
as
it
was
the
first
beer
for
me
to
try
in
the
style
i
was
surprised
by
a
lot
about
it
it
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
balance
in
this
beer
was
tremendous
with
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
that
was
very
wellhidden
i
shared
a
bottle
with
a
friend
and
we
both
found
it
highly
drinkable
bottle
exploded
lost
13
of
beer
pours
cloudy
gold
with
a
substantial
white
head
bready
byeasty
aroma
with
strong
notes
of
citrus
and
spice
taqste
has
initial
components
of
grass
and
citrus
but
spicy
hops
take
over
and
lead
to
a
peppery
bitter
finish
definitely
an
impressive
beer
wish
it
didnt
spill
over
a
great
beer
indeed
d
no
hint
of
the
9
which
means
dangerously
drinkable
first
time
ive
had
it
and
very
glad
its
readily
available
overall
pretty
drinkable
beer
a
refreshing
summery
ale
overall
a
great
drinker
my
tulip
glass
was
emptied
in
no
time
at
all
this
beer
was
absolutely
incredible
nice
golden
color
with
a
cloudy
appearence
with
a
masssive
foamy
white
head
that
coated
my
glass
wonderful
citrus
spiced
aromas
followed
by
a
crisp
and
spicy
hop
flavor
that
was
wellbalanced
at
9
abv
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
so
far
over
all
a
truly
fine
belgian
delight
this
beer
is
a
study
in
contrasts
both
sweet
and
bitter
without
coming
across
as
disjointed
or
confused
leave
it
to
brasserie
dachouffe
to
challenge
both
the
mind
and
the
palate
with
another
terrific
creation
whether
youre
a
fan
of
the
belgian
tripel
style
or
a
devotee
of
the
american
hopbomb
there
is
something
for
you
to
like
in
this
beer
far
from
a
session
beer
the
dobbelen
ipa
tripel
is
one
i
could
enjoy
with
great
frequency
if
not
quantity
well
done
da
awesome
and
complex
beer
balance
of
malt
and
hops
is
great
watch
out
for
the
alcohol
content
this
is
a
great
beer
i
do
not
really
care
for
ipa
but
this
is
in
the
top
for
me
will
drink
it
any
chance
i
got
d
quite
drinkable
for
9
very
tasty
well
balanced
and
more
importantly
intriguing
this
is
such
a
brilliant
blend
of
styles
that
it
blows
my
mind
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
9
and
an
experimental
style
to
boot
an
inspiring
beer
for
sure
good
beer
for
sure
fine
carbonation
adds
to
the
pleasure
of
this
beer
its
a
nice
beer
with
multiple
facets
to
it
being
my
first
belgian
ipa
i
dig
the
style
its
not
as
biting
as
an
american
style
ipa
and
its
got
more
personality
then
an
english
one
a
nice
one
that
i
am
sure
will
spur
on
my
beer
obsession
i
got
her
down
easily
enough
but
its
not
near
the
top
of
my
list
for
an
encore
although
this
is
one
great
beer
a
little
more
carbonation
in
this
brew
would
put
this
near
perfection
still
this
beer
in
a
word
yum
i
would
definitely
give
this
a
try
again
sometime
a
really
enjoyable
and
unique
brew
notes
this
was
a
good
choice
and
will
remain
with
me
forever
on
this
special
day
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
found
that
after
finishing
one
i
did
not
really
think
i
could
handle
another
the
big
strong
flavors
here
are
very
good
but
not
something
i
can
handle
a
lot
of
the
best
of
both
worlds
is
present
in
this
ipa
the
citrus
notes
of
a
classic
belgium
ale
are
followed
by
the
intense
hops
you
would
expect
from
an
american
ipa
with
a
clean
finish
thanks
to
the
alcohol
great
for
a
sipping
beer
but
it
is
best
cold
other
reviews
have
noted
the
lacing
and
head
retention
but
seeing
is
believing
for
this
one
definately
worth
your
time
all
in
all
another
tasty
ftom
the
chouffe
guys
this
is
one
i
will
try
again
totally
dig
the
mix
of
flavors
in
this
hybrid
only
thing
i
would
add
to
it
is
a
little
more
amarillo
otherwise
an
outstanding
brew
that
i
will
probably
never
know
how
to
pronounce
ive
never
really
had
anything
like
this
before
its
a
strong
belgian
with
lots
of
hops
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
or
any
others
by
the
same
brewers
houblon
chouffe
poured
a
hazy
and
bright
lemon
yellow
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
of
white
foam
i
thought
the
retention
was
ok
but
it
could
have
been
better
it
managae
to
leave
to
leave
behind
a
handful
of
foamy
white
rings
along
the
edge
and
spots
of
lace
here
and
there
the
aroma
was
a
bit
on
the
yeasty
side
with
spicy
citrus
hops
a
pinch
of
citrus
fruits
and
a
dash
of
pine
in
the
background
the
taste
started
of
gentle
with
yeast
and
fruit
esters
and
then
after
the
esters
have
passed
in
comes
the
dried
citrus
hops
a
drop
of
lemon
more
citrus
fruits
and
then
it
finished
up
with
fruity
yeast
the
hops
in
here
werent
as
aggressive
as
i
thought
they
were
going
to
be
it
was
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
contained
a
nice
aftertaste
of
citrus
hops
and
fruity
yeast
i
couldnt
help
but
notice
that
it
really
masked
its
high
9
abv
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
from
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
that
the
abv
was
that
high
overall
a
nice
not
too
overly
agressive
hoppy
belgian
beer
dmight
go
for
something
a
little
cheaper
but
its
a
great
beer
d
the
gnomes
always
seem
to
make
beers
that
require
you
to
take
your
time
and
this
is
no
exception
you
cant
swig
it
as
easily
as
most
american
dipas
but
nearly
all
serious
beer
lovers
are
gonna
be
happy
with
this
beer
hopheads
will
love
it
aficionados
of
belgian
beers
will
love
it
and
theres
enough
malt
and
interesting
spicy
yeast
stuff
going
on
to
satiate
those
who
like
their
beer
rich
and
malty
it
will
also
satisfy
those
who
love
a
good
hoppy
farmhouse
ale
like
me
not
for
the
neophyte
though
cut
your
teeth
on
american
dipas
and
bspas
and
then
get
back
to
this
this
belgian
ipa
thing
is
a
great
idea
and
the
brasserie
dachouffe
is
just
the
brewery
to
execute
it
to
nearperfection
the
level
of
craft
here
is
very
evident
if
i
ever
make
it
to
belgium
these
guys
are
tops
on
my
list
of
places
to
visit
this
might
even
be
their
best
beer
and
thats
saying
a
lot
all
hail
the
gnomes
d
drinkability
is
good
overall
the
beer
is
smoother
than
expected
alcohol
is
somewhat
hidden
which
makes
this
beer
go
down
even
easier
definitely
a
beer
i
would
have
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
cool
combination
of
a
belgian
ale
with
big
hops
definitely
worth
trying
my
first
belgian
double
ipa
who
would
of
thought
the
style
existed
very
few
exist
according
to
ba
so
here
goes
maybe
the
only
one
ill
ever
try
it
looks
like
a
hefe
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
tons
of
lacing
and
a
huge
huge
head
smell
is
like
a
hefe
aswell
but
with
more
hop
undertoes
taste
is
absolutely
magical
its
just
amazing
im
at
a
loss
for
words
its
like
heaven
came
down
in
the
form
of
a
beer
and
poured
itself
for
me
to
drink
its
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
its
a
very
mild
double
ipa
its
nothing
like
any
american
double
ipas
not
even
remotely
as
hoppy
as
most
american
ipas
but
has
a
more
malty
flavor
to
it
and
alot
of
carbonation
i
really
cant
formulate
any
words
its
just
perfect
the
flavor
is
also
quite
grassy
but
brings
along
other
notes
tangy
orange
pepper
lemon
dandelion
and
booze
a
nice
alcohol
bite
grips
the
back
of
the
palate
its
not
overwhelming
and
quite
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
bubbly
with
a
prickly
hop
grass
alcohol
finish
an
excellent
aftertaste
of
americanstyle
hops
is
left
behind
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
belgian
beers
around
even
at
9
abv
its
complex
tasty
smooth
refreshing
and
certainly
a
brew
ill
be
purchasing
again
very
good
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
im
going
to
slowly
enjoy
this
had
this
ontap
at
a
bar
in
amsterdam
in
december
i
had
never
had
it
and
i
chose
it
at
random
but
i
was
not
disappointed
it
was
served
in
the
chouffe
glass
pours
very
cloudy
with
a
thick
head
great
smells
of
citrus
lots
of
lemon
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
such
high
alcohol
content
very
complex
but
balanced
good
hop
flavor
balanced
by
the
citrus
overall
an
exceptional
beer
so
much
so
i
ordered
another
one
i
was
very
happy
to
find
it
in
my
local
liquor
store
on
columbus
st
in
boston
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
excellent
very
drinkable
despite
being
9
abv
i
could
drink
a
few
more
of
these
easily
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
d
superior
malt
to
hop
balance
very
complex
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
beer
lovers
dream
best
of
bspa
and
american
ipa
mcrisp
light
and
sweet
despite
high
alcohol
carbonation
is
just
right
and
balance
is
good
its
a
potent
brew
but
so
delicious
you
will
end
up
having
at
least
a
little
too
much
very
nice
beer
one
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
enjoy
anytime
but
my
favorite
ipa
of
any
variety
is
still
urthels
bought
this
beer
as
a
single
after
seeing
it
was
a
combo
of
two
of
my
favorites
belgian
tripel
and
an
ipa
poured
a
very
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
two
and
a
half
finger
head
which
lingered
a
half
a
finger
throughout
the
drink
aroma
was
of
a
lot
of
citrus
but
my
sinuses
have
been
acting
up
so
my
nose
is
really
not
up
to
snuff
taste
was
everything
i
expected
first
drink
there
was
a
lot
of
hops
up
front
then
mild
malts
with
a
dry
hopped
finish
after
that
it
was
strange
some
drinks
i
primarily
tasted
the
first
combo
others
were
a
rich
malty
taste
with
a
hoppy
finish
very
nice
and
different
mouthfeel
was
good
with
good
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
drinkability
was
a
little
too
goodif
thats
possible
because
i
found
myself
sipping
on
it
continuously
because
it
was
so
tasty
but
different
than
anything
ive
previously
had
i
will
be
buying
this
again
soon
clean
crisp
and
airy
to
the
nose
spicy
and
tart
to
the
mouth
saaz
dominates
with
the
amarillo
a
sombrero
on
the
label
and
tomahawk
feathers
bringing
up
the
rear
the
light
spice
of
a
triple
the
hop
presence
of
a
pale
ale
i
found
it
quite
intriguing
and
enjoyable
very
crisp
and
light
for
the
high
abv
and
very
easy
to
drink
these
could
get
you
in
trouble
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
massive
billowy
and
recedes
at
a
glacial
pace
into
thick
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
orange
peel
barnyard
and
hints
of
grapefruit
and
caramel
the
taste
begins
with
funky
barnyard
then
some
citrus
and
finishes
with
dry
lingering
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
like
how
the
aroma
and
taste
differ
i
would
drink
this
again
d
exceptional
my
first
belgian
ipa
and
i
loved
it
i
may
have
to
pick
up
a
couple
bottles
to
see
how
it
tastes
that
way
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
pure
pleasure
i
am
not
an
advocate
of
mixing
beers
but
if
you
could
perfectly
mix
a
orval
with
a
traditional
belgian
ipa
this
would
be
it
outstading
beer
overall
i
urge
all
fans
of
belgian
and
ipa
beers
to
seek
this
beer
out
at
all
costs
d
yes
if
i
werent
driving
a
rental
2wheel
drive
minivan
they
were
out
of
every
other
type
of
car
on
icy
maine
roads
i
wouldve
had
more
than
one
it
is
intensely
flavorful
and
i
dont
think
i
could
session
these
but
id
be
good
for
a
couple
and
given
the
high
abv
and
the
powerful
flavor
profile
that
says
quite
a
lot
d
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
recommended
very
interesting
for
the
palette
indeed
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
from
the
head
with
a
nice
dry
pucker
lingering
musty
after
taste
very
enjoyable
m
d
a
nice
body
smooth
and
almost
creamy
but
with
a
dry
finish
one
id
get
again
and
again
i
had
meant
to
get
more
chouffe
products
for
a
while
and
finally
had
a
fellow
make
the
recommendation
of
it
this
evening
so
i
decided
it
was
time
it
was
a
wise
choice
ill
have
to
buy
him
a
beer
next
time
around
a
nice
drinker
goes
down
very
smooth
the
touch
of
alcohol
warmth
serves
as
a
gentle
reminder
that
its
got
some
oomph
but
its
still
nice
for
a
little
beyond
sipping
must
try
this
again
at
the
cold
end
of
the
range
45
vs
the
warm
end
55
i
appreciate
the
quality
of
the
individual
components
of
this
deal
but
feel
like
the
guy
in
that
bad
snl
appalachian
emergency
room
skit
with
the
railroad
spike
through
his
head
my
head
aint
hurt
dis
bad
since
i
did
one
of
dem
sudoku
puzzles
i
really
want
to
have
this
without
the
saaz
and
replacing
them
with
something
like
dunno
columbus
this
is
very
well
made
but
stands
the
palate
on
its
end
something
fierce
impressive
had
on
tap
at
the
englander
in
san
leandro
poured
into
a
chouffe
tulip
glass
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
only
a
small
head
remaining
by
the
time
it
reached
my
table
smell
was
bubble
gum
hops
and
glorius
sweet
yeasty
funk
smell
the
taste
was
fantastic
it
had
a
distrinct
bubblegum
sweet
yeast
taste
that
was
balanced
by
an
underlying
bitterness
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
bunch
of
yeast
floaties
in
suspension
and
a
towering
white
head
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
thats
sweet
and
dry
with
a
slight
warming
effect
the
hop
aroma
is
excellent
it
blends
well
with
the
spicey
yeast
scent
and
the
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
great
as
well
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
complexity
the
malt
taste
is
solid
pale
with
a
dry
finish
the
yeast
component
is
wonderful
its
earthy
with
a
spicey
character
the
hops
provide
a
bitter
edge
but
they
really
work
well
with
the
yeast
the
spiciness
is
a
wonderful
companion
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
lived
up
to
the
hype
it
complex
and
flavorful
a
damn
good
drinker
d
delicious
and
keeps
me
wanting
more
it
is
strong
though
drinkability
is
fair
not
overwhelmingly
bitter
so
i
was
easily
able
to
finish
a
750ml
myself
however
i
recommend
drinking
this
brew
slowly
or
the
9
abv
will
catch
up
with
you
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
which
exploded
upon
opening
pours
an
electric
pale
orange
color
with
a
good
sized
pure
white
head
that
left
some
fantastic
rocky
lacing
and
chunky
cap
the
smell
is
excellent
nice
belgian
spices
light
banana
and
clove
candi
sugar
barn
yard
funk
yeast
combined
with
a
citrus
like
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
of
a
beautiful
golden
belgian
ale
definitely
tripel
like
with
the
candi
sugar
belgian
yeast
the
phenols
dont
stand
out
as
much
as
a
traditional
tripel
there
is
a
noticable
hop
presence
in
the
finish
stale
grassy
hops
with
a
light
piney
and
citrus
hop
combination
the
feel
is
moderate
with
tingly
carbonation
finishes
a
hair
slick
but
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
the
rest
of
the
night
good
beer
my
only
criticism
of
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
the
beer
exploded
upon
opening
leaving
me
with
only
a
portion
of
the
contents
and
pushed
the
yeast
into
suspension
other
than
that
this
beer
is
a
thing
of
beauty
hop
character
is
classy
yet
in
your
face
it
reminds
me
of
a
blend
of
duvel
saison
dupont
and
an
american
ipa
like
bridgeport
ipa
unique
highly
recommended
overall
a
very
convincing
belgian
ipa
had
this
before
on
tap
at
monks
and
teresas
next
door
but
today
i
am
having
this
at
home
overall
a
well
brewed
belgian
attempt
to
fuse
a
tradition
belgian
tripel
and
american
ipa
i
love
this
particular
style
because
i
love
hops
but
also
this
style
has
provided
me
more
familiarity
of
tripels
whcih
has
led
to
a
love
of
them
and
saisons
i
do
especially
like
the
yeasty
and
funk
notes
the
tripel
provides
and
the
subtle
european
hops
creep
through
a
bit
stronger
after
you
swallow
your
sip
i
love
the
fruity
character
of
this
beer
and
yeasty
beer
sediment
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
theres
always
lots
of
foam
with
these
tripelipa
hybrids
and
its
attractive
the
foam
is
almost
like
merange
sp
very
thick
i
fine
beer
to
drink
i
would
have
preferedd
more
of
a
hop
character
but
this
is
my
first
belgium
ipa
so
im
expecting
my
palate
to
change
as
i
seek
out
more
of
this
style
for
where
i
am
now
this
is
a
worthwhile
brew
though
i
prefer
american
ipas
and
belgium
well
belgiums
d
what
a
great
beer
this
was
a
serious
treat
and
im
going
to
have
to
pick
up
more
of
it
its
very
well
balanced
but
keeps
all
of
the
unique
elements
very
present
definitely
one
to
seek
out
if
you
havent
tried
one
rock
sings
the
fermentation
characteristics
of
a
tripel
spicy
yeasty
fruity
and
full
of
life
from
the
other
rock
sings
the
floral
high
notes
and
bitter
bass
of
a
dipa
but
somehow
chouffe
steers
clear
of
the
pitfalls
of
both
the
nose
is
spicy
and
fruity
with
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
in
there
its
hard
to
detect
whats
hops
and
whats
esters
the
flavor
brings
some
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
pils
malt
sweetness
slight
pineapple
and
a
finsih
that
allows
malt
yeast
and
hops
to
have
syncopated
solos
tastes
of
honey
are
left
on
my
lips
as
i
look
forward
to
another
bottle
brown
bottle
amen
mouthfeel
was
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
not
watery
at
all
very
light
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
outstanding
d
you
can
have
two
in
a
night
and
be
done
not
a
session
brew
but
youre
not
expecting
that
with
a
brew
of
this
stature
either
dawesome
i
love
this
damn
beers
hands
down
my
favorite
belgium
the
only
thing
i
wish
is
the
head
was
not
as
big
i
just
cant
wait
that
long
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
at
nikkis
in
np
ri
based
on
the
beer
advocate
ratings
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
simple
perfection
like
an
orval
but
with
a
lot
more
kick
the
flavor
is
very
crisp
clean
and
balanced
its
a
strong
one
not
to
be
rushed
so
you
can
enjoy
the
experience
i
plan
to
make
this
one
a
regular
nice
thick
mouthfeel
not
particularly
drinkable
poured
this
into
a
tulip
glass
looks
fantastic
transparent
golden
yellow
with
a
massive
fluffy
white
head
impressive
lacing
that
sticks
all
over
the
place
smell
is
very
hoppy
and
sweet
layers
of
yeast
lie
underneath
the
hops
very
fragrant
taste
is
both
bitter
and
fruity
at
the
same
time
lots
of
citrus
but
also
white
grapes
and
apples
tasty
nice
and
full
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
finishes
kind
of
dry
wellbalanced
very
warming
on
a
cold
winters
night
pairs
well
with
blue
cheese
a
close
friend
and
super
mario
galaxy
drinkability
is
just
ok
here
obviously
not
a
session
beer
because
of
the
abv
but
the
thin
mouthfeel
and
bitterness
at
the
end
affect
drinkability
my
firstever
beer
from
the
brewery
brasserie
dachouffe
and
i
was
completely
blown
away
by
the
overall
quality
and
outstanding
character
of
this
terrific
sample
from
a
1pint
16
fl
oz
large
green
bottle
pours
an
exceptional
appearance
with
a
cloudy
frothy
hazy
sedimentfilled
strawish
color
with
immense
bubbly
head
with
impressive
staying
power
smell
is
very
intense
with
a
distinct
bubblegum
aroma
pouring
out
of
the
bottle
with
fruit
and
slight
hops
smell
taste
was
superb
full
of
fresh
fruit
sweet
grapefruit
and
only
slight
hops
hardly
any
bitterness
detected
at
all
which
surprised
me
considering
the
logo
on
the
bottle
claimed
it
was
an
ipa
tripel
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
with
such
a
sweet
marriage
of
perfect
flavors
and
a
delicate
balance
of
amarillo
tomahawk
and
saaz
hops
as
far
as
the
9
abv
is
concerned
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
detect
with
such
strong
and
rich
flavors
outstanding
worldclass
brew
definitely
recommended
will
buy
this
one
again
if
i
ever
find
it
interested
in
cellaring
but
unsure
about
the
bottlecap
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
is
absolutely
delicious
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
nice
mix
of
belgian
tripel
and
more
american
hop
character
yet
different
enough
to
stand
on
its
own
pours
clouded
gold
nice
level
of
offwhite
head
nose
is
very
yeasty
flavor
is
full
of
funk
and
hops
earthy
aftertaste
like
a
deep
clay
yeast
is
definitely
there
as
well
robust
is
the
key
word
here
feel
has
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
a
good
liquid
feel
overall
very
good
extremely
hearty
and
robust
yet
consistent
this
poured
a
murky
gold
with
a
thick
big
rocky
white
super
longlasting
head
and
lacing
visible
large
floaties
and
sediment
towards
the
bottom
bouqet
was
powerful
and
very
complex
honey
hard
candy
resiny
and
citric
fresh
bread
dough
apricots
along
with
some
grassy
notes
and
musty
barnyard
aromas
taste
was
sweet
malts
with
a
smooth
prominent
hop
bitterness
with
some
sourness
present
mouthfeel
was
barely
mediumbodied
and
being
belgian
lighter
than
expected
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
would
be
more
drinkable
if
i
could
put
down
more
than
one
of
these
bigass
bottles
without
ending
up
on
the
floor
great
belgian
tripel
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
first
pour
into
my
tulip
yields
dare
i
say
it
perfect
appearance
this
is
one
nice
looking
beer
fluffy
frothhy
head
with
some
serious
staying
power
sticky
resiny
lacing
left
behind
color
is
a
cloudy
straw
blonde
faint
hops
presence
in
the
aroma
but
nothing
overbearing
some
yeastiness
and
barnyard
promise
a
belgian
treat
i
have
had
this
before
and
it
seems
as
though
the
hop
presence
was
stronger
than
this
may
be
that
this
bottle
is
not
as
fresh
no
matter
still
a
wonderful
beer
faint
hop
bittering
against
a
sweet
tripel
nice
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
luxurious
only
real
downfall
i
have
is
with
drinkability
this
is
jus
one
of
those
beer
that
falls
into
the
sipper
catagory
it
is
heavy
filling
and
full
of
warming
alcohol
a
bomber
was
almost
too
much
for
me
almost
and
the
best
news
this
wonderful
beer
is
much
more
available
than
my
other
favorites
seek
this
out
drinkability
is
good
this
scores
points
here
for
originality
and
complexity
a
very
interesting
beer
to
sip
i
like
it
and
i
am
glad
i
have
another
i
can
drink
at
a
later
date
bitter
flavor
up
front
hops
form
the
main
element
of
the
flavor
with
smooth
malt
a
hint
of
sweetness
though
it
doesnt
do
much
to
stand
up
to
the
complex
hop
profile
d
i
really
think
i
have
found
a
new
favorite
beer
style
as
i
am
in
love
with
belgian
ipas
at
the
moment
id
have
a
very
very
hard
time
choosing
between
either
this
or
a
piraat
this
is
a
clean
easy
drinking
refreshing
beer
that
is
very
complex
and
beautiful
to
look
at
if
i
were
in
on
a
hop
kick
id
take
this
if
i
were
looking
for
something
sweeter
id
take
the
piraat
if
i
had
a
wad
of
bills
id
take
a
case
of
each
this
beer
is
a
must
for
anyone
interested
in
mendelian
genetics
pours
a
beautiful
yellow
with
an
amazingly
fluffy
three
finger
head
i
love
it
when
you
take
a
sip
and
get
foam
on
your
nose
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
incredibly
strong
and
reeks
of
both
hops
and
bread
with
some
pleasant
spice
aromas
at
first
sip
i
thought
trippel
but
then
the
ipa
came
through
and
the
ardennes
hop
flavors
delight
but
only
for
a
moment
as
the
carbonation
and
creaminess
of
a
classic
belgian
trippel
finish
the
taste
incredibly
smooth
and
the
small
amount
of
bitterness
that
there
is
is
only
in
the
middle
which
is
an
incredible
feat
this
is
the
perfect
meld
of
a
belgian
ipa
and
a
classic
belgian
trippel
great
accomplishment
and
a
must
for
any
belgian
fan
drinkability
this
is
very
drinkable
though
a
bit
dry
it
is
nice
melding
of
two
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
a
pretty
unique
beer
there
is
almost
no
hint
of
the
high
alcohol
content
of
an
imperial
ipa
or
a
trippel
mellow
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
pour
that
doesnt
come
out
to
much
in
the
mouth
the
crispness
of
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
absorbed
by
the
yeastygrainwheat
feel
very
tasty
and
unique
im
not
one
to
give
straight
marks
but
this
one
is
superior
in
every
way
d
i
remember
the
big
ipa
hops
being
more
dominant
on
tap
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
i
didnt
really
care
for
my
first
european
take
on
a
uslike
hop
bomb
the
brooklynschneider
hopfen
weiss
but
this
is
much
more
up
my
alley
i
really
like
the
fact
that
one
can
taste
both
the
ipa
and
belgian
components
here
they
blend
very
well
together
but
are
distinct
at
the
same
time
from
the
smell
alone
i
would
think
ipa
but
the
belgian
yeast
figures
prominently
in
the
taste
curbing
what
might
otherwise
be
a
dryly
bitter
beer
the
taste
is
still
primarily
hops
though
with
complexity
added
by
malts
and
citrus
on
tap
at
lukas
in
oakland
dark
golden
pour
a
little
cloudyyeasty
looking
actually
definitely
unfiltered
nice
subdued
hop
aroma
more
yeastyesterybelgian
aroma
than
a
hop
aroma
awesome
hopyeast
flavors
some
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
some
from
the
hops
apparently
the
hop
flavor
is
from
amarillo
which
citrus
flavors
seems
to
work
very
well
with
the
esters
in
the
yeast
very
dry
extremely
drinkable
a
very
unique
marriage
of
the
double
ipa
and
belgian
brewing
indeed
an
excellent
beer
d
this
is
a
great
beer
from
the
chouffe
brewey
a
fantastic
mix
of
styles
each
part
lends
a
simple
elegance
to
a
tasty
beer
pricey
but
worth
it
great
on
tap
as
well
first
time
i
have
had
it
in
this
context
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
and
flavorful
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
its
definitely
worth
a
try
but
this
may
be
the
last
bottle
i
buy
for
myself
tastes
wonderful
the
label
does
not
lie
triple
ipa
for
sure
lots
of
bitter
hops
orange
pepper
yeasty
spiciness
once
again
more
powerful
when
the
sediment
makes
its
way
in
pale
malt
and
a
well
hidden
but
warming
alcohol
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
it
is
so
complex
and
i
was
amazed
how
much
it
changes
past
mid
bottle
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
huge
head

great
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
a
bit
fruity
the
taste
is
spicy
and
bitter
a
graincereal
taste
is
also
noted
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
it
has
a
dry
aftertaste
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
character
an
interesting
beer
but
having
tried
it
a
couple
of
times
now
i
think
i
can
safely
say
that
its
not
my
thing
bravo
this
is
made
for
big
important
meals
and
carries
the
complexity
and
dexterity
to
match
pretty
much
anything
it
is
paired
with
from
frozen
pizza
to
roasted
herbcrusted
grouse
to
rhubarb
pie
this
i
believe
would
shine
oh
and
it
shines
pretty
fucking
bright
on
its
own
too
in
the
absence
of
food
and
the
desire
for
more
once
the
750ml
is
gone
this
world
class
brew
im
a
big
hop
fan
and
i
really
appreciate
the
hybrid
approach
that
this
beer
appears
to
take
ive
only
within
the
last
couple
of
years
began
to
truely
appreciate
all
the
wonderful
beers
of
belgium
and
being
that
this
is
a
mix
of
two
of
my
current
favorite
styles
im
just
that
much
more
grateful
that
a
beer
like
this
was
made
a
heartfelt
thank
you
goes
out
to
anybody
and
everybody
involved
in
making
this
wonderful
beer
light
golden
color
slightly
chill
hazed
at
first
that
becomes
crystal
clear
a
late
arriving
white
head
overflowed
my
glass
and
stuck
around
in
big
clumps
looks
like
globs
of
shaving
cream
as
it
falls
leaves
sticky
globs
on
the
side
of
the
glass
nice
crisp
floral
hops
smell
with
a
nice
spicyness
in
the
background
very
interesting
combination
hops
up
front
in
the
taste
which
is
quicly
followed
by
a
spicyness
that
drys
the
finish
out
this
is
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
a
great
combination
of
hop
bitterness
and
yeasty
spiceyness
that
balances
out
nicely
pepper
spice
flavor
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
best
of
2
worlds
american
ipa
and
belgian
ale
presented
in
a
kinda
cutsie
bottle
with
a
cartoon
of
the
little
chouffe
but
it
is
a
great
brew
pours
a
yellowish
hazy
copper
with
a
massive
fourfinger
head
long
lasting
and
leaves
lacing
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
hoppy
and
spicey
tastes
fruity
and
citrusy
from
the
american
hop
bill
but
the
toasted
malty
flavors
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
add
a
pleasant
balance
bitter
taste
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
but
carbonated
well
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
hope
there
are
more
of
these
crosscontinental
hybrids
of
ipas
and
belgians
ive
tried
greenflash
brewing
co
s
le
freak
belgian
ipa
now
i
can
fix
my
craving
for
a
trippelgolden
and
an
american
ipa
at
the
same
time
wheres
my
rig
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
aromas
of
a
sweet
yeastiness
and
a
nice
presence
of
hops
as
in
the
taste
a
dry
yeasy
and
hoppy
with
a
small
belgian
sweetness
a
very
clean
mouthfeel
with
a
bitter
yeast
aftertaste
all
i
can
say
is
what
is
better
than
a
belgian
triple
that
is
actually
an
imperial
double
ipa
interesting
unlike
an
american
ipa
and
unlike
most
other
belgium
ipas
ive
experienced
thick
head
for
an
ipa
with
a
distinct
brownj
color
this
is
just
simply
a
kick
ass
beer
bursting
with
fruit
and
hop
character
without
being
to
belgian
and
leaving
odd
ends
on
the
palate
a
moderate
amount
of
sweetness
on
the
mid
palate
and
finish
9
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
as
this
taste
to
good
to
care
thick
with
passion
and
tropical
fruits
that
lead
into
clove
and
citrusy
hop
with
a
resiny
feel
to
them
a
near
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
just
a
solid
great
tasting
overly
drinkable
beer
very
drinkable
considering
the
strong
abv
the
coolest
part
about
this
beer
was
the
head
it
was
really
clumpy
and
thick
and
it
left
large
pieces
on
the
sides
as
it
fell
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
suprise
i
heard
good
things
about
the
belgian
take
on
the
ipa
and
was
not
disappointed
very
tasty
and
very
well
balanced
the
nice
sweet
malts
of
the
tripel
style
mesh
with
the
hops
of
the
ipa
style
beautifully
highly
recommended
at
first
this
gem
i
got
from
the
nepa
case
split
club
seemed
mislabeled
as
i
wanted
to
know
where
the
hops
were
hiding
but
they
are
in
the
aroma
and
have
a
pleasant
grapefruity
streak
in
the
flavor
but
the
almost
trademark
chouffe
yeast
and
malty
flavors
rule
the
day
even
though
i
have
to
say
both
hops
and
malts
are
well
blended
and
balanced
there
is
a
slight
sour
aftertaste
going
on
but
it
doesnt
diminish
the
overall
experience
heavily
d
the
flavour
is
big
bold
but
body
is
relatively
light
digestable
old
world
meets
the
new
world
with
a
wonderful
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
drinkability
golden
ale
with
a
heavy
white
foam
that
eventually
settles
down
to
a
long
lasting
fine
soapy
head
smell
of
grapefruit
and
spice
with
light
floral
tones
taste
begins
sharp
but
immediately
sets
sweet
and
lingers
to
the
top
hop
and
then
balances
to
semidry
and
finishes
with
a
hint
of
black
pepper
no
kidding
a
lasting
and
complex
flavor
event
kudos
to
the
makers
for
combining
the
best
attributes
of
belgium
and
north
america
to
create
such
a
delicious
brew
one
of
my
personal
favorites
for
sure
best
enjoyed
with
good
friends
outstanding
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
for
an
advocate
who
started
out
in
the
microbrew
scene
with
ipas
only
to
eventually
come
to
explore
the
belgian
crowd
this
is
definitely
a
welcome
hybrid
price
is
an
issue
however
as
this
style
doesnt
seem
readily
available
i
paid
7
99
for
my
bottle
not
too
pricey
but
just
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
a
regular
dinnerdrink
weekends
looks
great
in
the
karmelit
glass
nice
dense
white
head
and
a
true
golden
body
the
aroma
attacks
me
before
the
glass
even
gets
in
my
hand
candied
hops
and
spicy
yeast
bits
the
taste
is
a
hopped
up
but
with
gentle
citrus
and
noble
type
triple
and
the
alcohol
blooms
on
the
back
end
that
leaves
a
tang
of
wonderful
hops
and
yeast
nice
drinkable
body
and
this
is
something
i
will
drink
again
a
very
drinkable
beer
just
wish
i
had
someone
to
share
this
with
at
the
moment
being
an
aipa
fan
a
very
cool
spin
on
the
dipa
through
a
belgian
brew
i
look
forward
to
bringing
a
bottle
or
two
to
some
friends
house
over
dinner
glad
i
finally
stumbled
across
this
beer
drinkability
this
is
what
disappointed
me
i
love
ipa
and
all
though
i
have
little
experience
with
belgian
ipa
i
felt
that
the
brewer
was
just
trying
to
burn
my
palate
with
bitterness
that
came
off
harsh
and
didnt
tap
into
the
american
sense
of
flavor
aroma
and
bittering
that
make
ipa
so
wonderful
i
drank
the
bottle
but
with
the
high
alcohol
and
the
lingering
mouth
feel
i
wouldnt
have
had
any
more
wowzers
get
on
this
brew
now
an
amazingly
complex
and
refreshing
beer
both
physically
and
stylistically
its
good
to
see
the
belgians
embracing
the
high
aa
hops
lazy
gold
with
generous
white
headlacing
tons
of
suspended
yeast
adds
texture
not
much
carbonation
yeast
dominates
the
smell
with
honey
mild
citric
hops
and
alcohol
all
playing
their
parts
citrus
hops
make
way
for
a
sticky
malt
base
and
plenty
of
yeast
characteristics
adding
spicinesstropical
fruits
along
the
way
large
amounts
of
toasted
grain
make
an
appearance
towards
the
end
bitter
hop
finish
cleans
the
palette
while
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
sticks
around
on
the
tongue
solid
mouthfeel
it
borders
on
slick
at
times
but
is
pulled
back
by
the
bittering
hops
fairly
medium
bodied
but
does
lean
towards
heavy
this
isnt
your
everyday
go
to
beer
but
its
good
for
the
right
occasion
i
could
drink
this
one
with
on
the
first
day
of
a
threeday
hangover
smooth
as
silk
every
sip
gives
you
something
more
beautiful
product
d
a
very
tasty
unique
and
fascinating
brew
the
mix
of
flavors
of
a
belgian
tripel
and
an
ipa
works
very
well
together
its
well
balanced
complex
and
very
delicious
ive
never
had
anything
like
it
and
i
likely
never
will
except
of
course
when
i
come
back
to
this
great
beer
what
a
funky
cross
style
throw
the
rules
out
the
window
beer
this
is
combination
almostdouble
ipa
and
belgian
tripel
interesting
interplay
of
belgian
yeast
and
loads
of
hops
the
belgian
spirit
of
beer
adventure
is
evident
here
and
the
sum
effect
was
good
but
not
outstanding
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
loved
the
mix
of
belgian
with
ipa
it
was
a
good
experience
and
i
would
get
it
again
but
only
if
i
could
split
it
with
someone
25
4
ounces
it
a
lot
to
drink
in
one
sitting
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
massive
creamy
white
head
that
sticks
around
like
nobodys
buisness
im
not
sure
ive
ever
seen
a
head
like
this
one
nose
is
like
citrus
flavored
cotton
candy
comes
through
very
citrusy
and
just
straight
yummy
a
little
bitter
with
a
very
bubbly
mouthfeel
yes
please
id
like
another
great
beer
love
of
hops
and
belgian
ales
combined
led
me
to
purchase
this
brew
however
i
was
suspicious
that
the
long
trip
across
the
world
to
my
beer
glass
might
result
in
hop
degradation
with
plenty
of
sweet
yeasty
belgian
flavor
this
beer
is
nothing
like
the
us
idea
of
a
hoppy
beer
the
hops
managed
to
maintain
a
touch
of
aroma
noticeable
citrus
hop
flavor
and
a
nicely
balanced
bitterness
this
beer
is
easy
to
enjoy
and
a
nice
change
from
the
ordinary
yeah
an
interesting
experiment
doesnt
quite
have
the
hop
presence
in
aroma
or
taste
i
thought
it
would
but
thats
probably
a
good
thing
as
the
belgian
side
seems
to
be
the
focus
i
picked
this
one
to
see
what
a
belgian
ipa
was
this
was
a
cloudy
yellow
beer
with
lots
of
floaty
yeasties
in
it
the
smell
was
nondescript
the
taste
was
a
little
citrus
hops
but
still
mostly
belgian
yeast
in
flavor
interesting
concept
but
calling
it
a
dobbelen
ipa
was
very
misleading
there
is
nothing
dipa
about
this
beer
the
only
thing
this
beer
had
in
common
with
a
dipa
was
they
type
of
hops
i
think
ill
pass
on
hoppy
beers
from
belgium
they
need
to
leave
the
hop
bombs
to
americans
who
know
what
they
are
doing
pours
out
a
striking
brass
tone
with
lively
carbonation
a
wavy
fluffy
head
and
impressive
lacing
nose
has
a
lot
of
grain
alcohol
spicy
yeast
and
some
citrus
and
herbal
hops
tones
i
also
get
some
candyish
sweet
tones
and
light
stone
fruits
flavor
begins
sweet
with
a
hefty
amount
of
pale
malt
and
some
graininess
some
citrus
and
floral
flavors
come
to
the
fore
along
with
a
backing
of
yeast
spices
finishes
still
dry
and
with
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
grain
just
stays
on
into
the
aftertaste
sweetness
and
booze
just
seems
to
come
out
more
as
this
warms
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
slick
for
me
but
the
carbonation
is
pleasant
and
the
weight
of
the
beer
on
the
tongue
is
acceptable
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
dont
think
everything
meshes
well
id
much
rather
a
de
ranke
xx
wonderful
and
highly
recommended
i
enjoyed
it
best
at
about
45f
cheers
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
some
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
white
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
mostly
hops
slight
citrus
and
coriander
the
taste
follows
the
nose
this
is
a
clean
fresh
kind
of
ipa
tasty
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
twist
on
an
ipa
belgian
style
recommended
seems
pretty
light
for
a
9
brew
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
glass
it
subsided
very
slowly
coating
the
glass
with
latticed
lace
and
looking
much
like
a
soda
it
was
a
very
hazy
yellow
color
the
aroma
was
of
hops
yeast
and
lemon
the
flavor
was
of
hops
bread
citrus
and
pepper
the
finish
was
fairly
light
and
had
some
elements
of
the
hop
bitterniss
and
the
pepper
another
good
beer
from
chouffe
now
if
i
could
just
learn
to
pour
them
properly
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
quaff
big
thanks
go
out
to
mrburton55
for
the
bottle
d
an
interesting
interpration
of
the
style
this
is
definitely
a
belgian
creation
and
i
enjoyed
this
brew
quite
a
bit
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bigger
and
more
pronounced
hop
profile
considering
the
use
of
tomahawk
amarillo
and
saaz
hops
recommended
9abv
be
damned
not
only
could
i
drink
this
until
i
died
but
id
have
a
happy
stay
in
hell
as
long
as
this
was
on
tap
an
extraordinary
thing
this
at
least
to
look
at
gold
covered
in
snow
thick
thick
snow
head
is
fabulous
with
great
staying
power
and
topography
visible
carbonation
gorgeous
smell
is
coriander
and
hops
didnt
dig
on
the
taste
so
much
i
love
double
ipas
and
triples
but
two
great
tastes
dont
necessarily
always
taste
great
together
this
is
interesting
but
to
me
a
mess
of
sweet
malt
and
predictable
spices
along
with
a
hellacious
blast
of
hops
its
interesting
and
applaud
them
for
what
theyve
done
but
there
is
no
way
in
hell
i
would
shell
out
ten
bucks
for
another
bottle
of
this
except
mayber
to
lay
one
down
for
6
months
to
a
year
to
see
if
the
flavors
meld
a
little
better
mouthfeel
starts
smooth
but
ends
stingy
and
obtrusive
hot
actually
a
for
arrogance
unfortunately
an
c
for
cohesiveness
it
may
be
a
triple
dubbel
but
this
is
no
magic
johnson
i
apologize
for
that
pun
i
really
do
recommended
far
and
away
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
had
as
it
is
not
too
heavy
on
the
pepper
and
really
hides
the
alcohol
nicely
i
dont
care
how
hard
it
is
to
get
your
hands
on
do
it
drinkability
wonderful
balance
of
hopped
and
belgian
tripel
if
your
a
fan
of
either
get
this
i
would
drink
this
anytime
it
was
presented
to
me
very
nice
from
start
to
finish
the
almost
solid
chunk
of
head
leftover
after
the
liquid
is
gone
was
a
tasty
treat
this
is
an
interesting
brew
and
handsdown
beautiful
but
a
little
dry
in
the
finish
for
my
liking
dinteresting
for
sure
nice
blend
of
styles
but
for
me
this
does
not
rate
as
an
alltime
great
definitely
enjoyable
but
nothing
i
would
go
back
to
dthis
is
very
good
d
is
right
up
there
higher
abv
will
prevent
excessive
consumption
though
an
altogether
excellent
beer
overall
this
was
one
of
my
best
beer
experiences
a
delicious
beer
that
embodies
the
best
of
an
ipa
barlywine
and
trippel
all
in
one
a
remarkable
accomplishment
my
my
this
one
sure
is
neat
pours
a
light
gold
into
my
chalice
the
fluffy
white
head
exploding
from
the
glass
and
keeps
until
settling
down
to
no
thinner
than
half
inch
crazy
lacing
in
bubbles
streaks
foam
this
is
crazy
the
only
problem
is
all
that
sediment
which
is
my
fault
the
aroma
tips
me
off
to
whats
to
come
a
delightful
mix
of
citrus
coriander
yeast
and
it
really
wafts
of
saison
more
than
anything
and
gets
me
thinking
why
havent
i
tasted
anything
like
this
mix
of
ipa
and
saison
ever
its
wondrous
and
then
to
taste
just
brilliant
take
every
good
quality
of
ipa
and
saison
which
coincidentally
is
everything
and
roll
them
into
one
nifty
little
bottle
and
you
have
this
and
add
to
that
rich
mouth
smooth
and
creamy
and
carbonated
just
right
with
a
good
body
and
the
slightest
feel
of
alcohol
warming
and
you
have
yourself
something
very
special
an
absolute
delight
a
treat
and
a
great
introduction
to
chouffe
i
was
wondering
when
i
bought
this
beer
what
style
it
would
fall
under
i
had
no
idea
that
belgian
ipa
was
a
style
it
pours
a
hazy
slightly
brownish
yellow
with
a
beautiful
thick
head
that
lingers
aroma
is
at
first
just
that
of
a
belgian
triple
but
then
a
huge
fresh
hop
smell
comes
out
fitting
in
perfectly
with
the
yeasty
aroma
taste
is
sweet
pale
malts
with
a
major
bitterness
the
spicey
chalky
yeast
flavor
comes
through
in
the
finish
just
as
the
citrusy
hop
flavor
really
takes
hold
there
is
very
little
alcohol
flavor
i
am
really
impressed
this
hybrid
style
really
shows
off
the
best
of
both
worlds
and
despite
the
flavor
extremes
it
maintains
quite
a
balance
this
beer
hides
its
9
alcohol
very
well
ill
have
to
get
another
fresher
bottle
to
see
if
the
aroma
improves
this
is
a
fascinating
experiment
and
a
solid
if
flawed
brew
i
will
be
more
than
happy
if
i
can
make
a
belgian
ipa
that
enters
the
same
ballpark
as
this
brew
750ml
green
bottle
from
burby
and
bates
murky
yellow
body
with
chunks
of
yeast
floating
around
and
a
couple
inches
of
white
to
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
smells
citrusy
and
piney
with
a
hint
of
skunk
tastes
sweet
citrusy
piney
unfortunately
im
tasting
just
a
hint
of
skunk
is
also
there
making
this
pretty
good
tasting
i
bet
this
beer
is
phenominal
fresh
or
on
tap
damn
these
green
bottles
still
quite
pleasant
and
drinkable
d
overall
this
was
really
nice
i
could
see
myself
having
a
glass
in
front
of
the
tv
anynight
very
hoppy
and
really
bitter
and
well
done
very
dry
finish
only
served
to
cap
off
a
great
experience
loved
this
one
d
decent
this
is
pretty
good
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
like
so
many
other
people
will
have
to
buy
a
fresh
bottled
example
to
compare
not
remotely
a
bad
beer
perhaps
just
one
that
i
dont
appreciate
beer
was
a
hazy
pale
yellow
and
very
foamy
aroma
was
of
champagne
and
slightly
sour
but
not
detectably
hoppy
flavor
was
puckery
upfront
like
a
tripel
and
the
finish
was
bitter
but
not
in
a
conventional
ipa
kind
of
way
a
very
distinct
flavor
all
the
way
through
a
very
soft
and
billowy
mouthfeel
delicious
dry
underlying
sweetness
to
the
beer
with
a
spicy
hoppy
bite
grainy
with
a
slight
malty
background
citrus
zestiness
comes
across
from
the
beginning
medium
mouthfeel
finishes
very
smooth
and
more
drinkable
than
it
began
a
little
less
lingering
bitterness
might
be
appreciated
but
this
is
quite
a
unique
beverage
i
guess
the
hops
and
abv
make
me
think
of
american
double
ipa
but
that
part
of
the
flavor
seems
more
reminiscent
of
english
ipa
albeit
a
bit
more
complex
regardless
it
is
the
first
successful
mating
ive
seen
between
tripel
and
ipa
ill
definitely
have
another
d
this
was
a
fairly
refreshing
beverage
it
was
also
very
interesting
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
but
was
worthwhile
nonetheless
cloudy
but
vibrant
gold
with
a
small
white
creamy
quickly
diminishing
head
yet
still
has
some
good
lacing
fruity
and
fresh
smell
berry
herbs
and
alcohol
esters
hops
really
come
out
as
soon
as
the
first
drop
hits
your
lips
wow
this
is
my
first
belgian
ipa
and
i
have
to
say
im
impressed
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
first
but
once
i
settled
into
it
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
was
not
the
us
hopbomb
i
expected
but
it
is
a
very
good
beer
gnomes
make
great
beer
overall
and
great
and
unique
beer
the
color
was
lighter
than
i
thought
but
not
a
bad
thing
the
head
is
incredibly
large
and
sustains
through
the
whole
beer
makes
me
wonder
what
a
belgian
double
ipa
would
taste
like
and
how
much
alc
they
would
make
it
color
is
cloudy
amber
with
a
very
thick
head
that
persists
like
whipped
cream
more
than
beer
foam
the
smell
is
weak
and
soso
but
the
taste
is
superb
smooth
with
a
bite
as
well
as
plenty
of
hoppiness
and
fruity
undertones
a
very
tasty
brew
that
is
worth
looking
for
i
found
it
at
the
brick
store
pub
in
decatur
just
east
of
atlanta
georgia
6
a
glass
highly
recommended
if
you
get
the
chance
do
it
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
filling
hell
of
a
kick
to
it
but
i
found
this
beer
fell
short
of
the
hype
surrounding
it
ordered
online
poured
into
my
schiltz
chalice
this
belgian
ale
poured
with
a
monstrous
foam
of
good
density
forming
cool
shapes
as
it
fell
dried
herbs
with
hints
of
fruits
white
peach
and
pear
some
aroma
hops
herbal
and
dry
initially
until
the
midpalate
leads
way
into
a
deep
sweet
estery
fruitiness
with
hints
of
mint
finish
has
some
hops
lingering
herb
and
spruce
just
okay
not
very
magical
could
be
hoppier
hmm
i
think
my
bottle
was
a
bit
light
struck
it
initially
smelled
skunky
but
letting
it
air
out
helped
tremendously
at
any
rate
pours
a
very
cloudy
golden
straw
yellow
a
few
bits
of
sediment
suspended
perfectly
throughout
huge
reactive
head
that
resembled
really
airy
whip
cream
some
parts
of
the
head
stuck
to
my
snifter
and
never
dissipated
now
americans
should
not
get
their
hopes
up
because
this
isnt
anything
like
an
american
ipa
however
you
can
pick
up
the
grapefruity
scent
and
flavor
of
the
hops
it
smells
like
a
tropical
smoothie
with
light
booze
it
tastes
exactly
how
i
thought
it
would
yeasty
citrusy
with
a
sweet
malt
background
medium
to
medium
full
body
that
is
perfectly
smooth
great
beer
i
find
it
very
drinkable
ovr
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
a
perfect
blend
of
a
hoppy
american
ipa
and
a
belgian
ive
always
loved
fantome
brise
bon
bons
which
is
similar
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
even
more
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
with
some
very
interesting
flavors
sorry
to
repeat
myself
but
the
flavors
do
come
together
nicely
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
have
seen
well
done
on
tap
at
biergarden
portsmouth
va
as
id
expected
a
very
belgian
visual
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
airy
foam
topping
this
drank
extremely
smoothly
with
a
definite
alcoholspice
kick
a
bit
of
a
dirty
orange
peel
aspect
wonderfully
complex
yeasty
bready
grassy
barky
with
a
quite
bitter
finish
excited
to
read
the
description
of
this
as
a
cross
with
american
imperial
ipas
because
it
all
makes
sense
now

drinkability
the
novelty
of
the
beer
is
enough
to
warrant
a
look
the
flavors
though
never
mix
together
well
enough
to
really
enjoy
drinkability
is
decent
what
a
great
blend
of
ipa
and
traditional
belgian
characters
medium
copper
color
with
a
thick
thick
foam
head
pale
cream
color
highly
aromatic
and
pleasant
great
taste
and
smooth
feel
both
before
and
after
swallow
leaves
you
wanting
more
d
i
have
tasted
several
attempts
at
trying
to
make
a
triple
and
an
ipa
work
together
and
they
never
have
this
is
amazing
with
the
perfume
hop
smells
and
tastes
with
a
slight
sweetness
to
enhance
the
hops
while
showing
them
with
a
yeast
note
the
hops
have
nice
big
flavors
but
are
not
a
kick
in
your
teeth
like
other
beers
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
a
good
kickintheteeth
hop
monster
aswell
d
excellent
this
is
a
great
brew
the
alcohol
is
not
too
much
though
it
is
present
not
for
mass
consumption
the
sweetness
is
present
throughout
making
the
bitter
finish
not
so
abrasive
i
will
be
drinking
this
more
often
the
label
dont
lie
it
tastes
like
a
highqualty
tripel
melded
with
a
high
quality
subtle
ipa
amazingly
balanced
and
quite
inspired
something
about
this
beer
conceptually
would
lead
one
to
believe
it
would
be
very
showy
and
bold
this
is
not
the
case
at
all
making
it
easy
to
appreciate
its
flavors
without
being
overwhelmed
or
forced
to
concentrate
all
that
hard
on
it
a
beautiful
beer
if
you
ever
see
this
on
tap
try
it
i
did
also
have
a
bottle
a
while
ago
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
most
on
tap
it
transformed
it
from
a
very
good
solid
beer
to
an
absolutely
exceptional
beer
this
beer
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
and
my
cellar
outstanding
top
3
beer
for
me
d
hedouble
hockey
sticks
yeah
i
may
have
to
make
another
trip
back
to
chicago
to
find
this
beer
note
i
am
not
usually
an
ipa
hophead
but
this
belgian
take
on
an
american
classic
is
an
interesting
turn
high
on
the
spicy
hop
bitterness
without
the
excessive
grassy
or
vegetative
fresh
hop
flavor
from
dry
hopping
and
late
additions
gives
a
strong
citrus
and
gingery
bitterness
that
finishes
clean
and
helps
cleanse
the
palate
from
strong
and
spicy
food
strong
like
an
iipa
but
light
and
bubbly
like
a
tripel
fantastic
soft
supple
bottleconditioned
mouthfeel
deadly
drinkable
for
how
big
it
is
less
hoppy
than
on
release
and
not
better
for
it
drink
up
imo
this
is
a
real
afternoon
sipper
and
a
crowd
pleaser

big
beer
drinkers
and
crossovers
too
beautiful
silkscreened
750
ml
capped
champagne
bottle
brewed
with
amarillo
tomahawk
and
saaz
it
pours
a
medium
to
dark
gold
with
quite
active
carbonation
that
subsides
fairly
quickly
and
is
topped
with
a
2
inch
rocky
head
that
is
fluffy
on
the
bottom
and
dense
as
meringue
on
top
the
lace
is
extremely
sticky
and
subsequent
pours
release
yeast
and
floaties
that
turn
the
body
a
hazed
peach
the
smell
is
essentially
all
hops
spicyperfumy
floral
citric
lemony
and
grassy
freshlycut
hay
with
notes
of
dried
apricot
pear
pine
and
a
lightly
musty
character
the
flavor
has
additional
notes
of
apples
and
raw
leafygreen
hops
which
contribute
a
medium
bitterness
it
would
be
higher
but
there
is
a
hefty
malt
background
taming
the
hops
and
reminding
us
of
the
tripel
influence
however
at
times
the
malts
become
a
touch
too
sweet
the
body
is
nice
and
smooth
medium
to
full
and
very
balanced
with
a
carbonation
that
starts
high
but
mellows
near
the
end
overall
quite
an
interesting
blend
of
the
two
styles
slowly
progressing
from
a
hoppy
dipa
to
a
sweet
malty
tripel
would
definitely
try
again
but
i
wish
the
malt
bill
were
slightly
smaller
drinkability
so
i
shared
this
750ml
amongst
a
few
friends
to
their
great
enjoyment
they
may
not
be
so
lucky
next
time
it
hides
the
high
level
of
alcohol
so
well
it
is
unnoticable
that
this
could
easily
creep
up
on
you
and
i
feel
until
that
level
hits
i
would
indulge
in
this
will
certainly
return
to
this
one
a
job
well
done
d
an
allaround
tasty
offering
that
excels
9
abv
makes
it
one
to
savor
still
this
style
is
done
exceedingly
well
and
i
would
order
another
and
stock
up
on
several
this
beer
is
just
stupidly
drinkable
never
mind
the
bigassed
bottle
i
had
no
problems
draining
this
one
such
a
great
combination
of
flavors
and
aromas
i
must
get
several
more
of
these
when
i
venture
west
to
ohio
next
time
this
is
one
damn
fine
beer
poured
a
golden
but
somewhat
murky
champagne
coloration
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
shooting
up
to
the
top
heading
was
thick
and
white
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
holding
up
very
well
aroma
definitely
had
some
odd
yeasty
smells
reminiscent
of
some
of
the
crappy
euro
pale
lagers
the
hop
bitterness
could
also
be
detected
which
was
probably
what
was
balancing
the
strong
yeast
smells
taste
was
pretty
damn
bitter
up
front
then
became
pretty
fruity
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
was
medium
i
would
say
with
lots
of
carbonation
but
not
too
much
i
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
off
the
bottle
but
i
think
once
is
enough
for
this
one
i
guess
my
problem
is
that
i
love
ipas
but
im
not
too
crazy
about
tripels
oh
well
its
worth
a
try
for
sure
drinkability
is
excellent
the
flavors
and
mouth
presence
are
so
wonderful
that
this
beer
just
disappears
from
the
glass
a
beer
that
i
could
just
keep
sucking
down
delicious
poured
from
750ml
bottle
to
a
red
wine
glass
great
white
billowing
head
one
one
of
the
nicest
snow
white
heads
i
have
seen
very
nice
golden
pale
hue
smell
is
of
saaz
hops
the
nose
was
a
lot
like
a
fresh
czech
pilsner
taste
the
hops
have
really
blended
in
well
with
the
malts
i
dont
know
the
age
of
this
beer
it
may
in
fact
have
some
age
on
it
very
balanced
and
absolutely
delicious
there
is
not
hint
that
this
is
a
9
beer
i
have
quite
a
few
pints
of
this
but
alas
it
is
my
only
bottle
i
will
miss
you
little
gnome
if
only
i
could
find
you
close
to
home
very
creative
offering
and
an
outstanding
beer
the
mouth
is
pleasantly
puckering
with
low
carbonation
the
elves
outdid
them
selves
with
this
one
viva
la
chouffe
beer
was
poured
slowly
but
resulted
in
a
gigantic
fluffy
head
that
is
leaving
lacing
all
over
my
duvel
glass
it
is
pale
in
color
and
highly
charged
from
the
carbonation
my
nose
was
greeted
with
a
nice
aroma
of
belgian
hops
and
yeast
light
citrus
and
spices
taste
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
a
belgian
tripel
and
a
strong
pale
ale
styles
an
orange
peel
hop
fuels
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
classic
belgian
smoothness
crossed
with
a
fine
dry
champagne
feel
drinkability
is
very
enjoyable
alcohol
is
slight
in
the
background
with
each
sip
this
is
an
interesting
style
which
i
would
recommend
to
belgian
pa
and
tripel
fans
very
unique
brew
that
im
glad
to
finally
try
great
to
see
some
belgian
brewers
being
this
innovative
and
mixing
styles
overall
this
is
an
incredibly
unique
beer
and
definitely
pulls
off
the
combining
of
the
two
different
styles
pours
hazy
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
billowing
snow
white
head
lots
of
belgian
lace
wonderfully
spiced
aroma
with
plenty
citrus
hop
aroma
sweet
candy
sugar
as
well
the
tripel
character
comes
through
perfect
and
the
amarican
hop
bitterness
is
very
evident
the
palate
is
great
full
but
refreshingly
carbonated
get
ya
some
as
advertised
this
is
a
tripel
ipa
not
an
iiipa
of
course
but
a
geniune
belgium
tripel
style
with
an
ipa
delivery
of
hops
this
is
a
hopheads
dream
come
true
assuming
that
theyre
fans
of
belgium
beers
but
who
isnt
pours
and
smells
like
a
quality
tripel
i
smell
bready
yeasts
spice
apple
and
a
hint
of
banana
good
sticky
head
retention
but
once
on
the
tongue
its
obvious
that
somethings
different
the
hop
profile
leaps
out
almost
immediately
citrus
burn
and
peppery
zest
starting
like
a
tripel
and
ending
like
a
solid
ipa
this
offering
finally
leaves
that
lovely
lingering
earthy
fruity
after
taste
once
the
hopsburn
fades
and
then
you
burp
up
a
little
grapefruit
this
is
fantastic
drinkable
for
sure
but
at
9
00
is
rather
heavy
duty
get
your
hands
on
one
of
these
enjoy
with
fuji
apples
and
sharp
white
cheddar
d
very
drinkable
beer
just
blew
through
the
750
ml
and
could
easily
do
another
maybe
two
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
full
bodied
very
nice
combo
of
hops
added
to
a
great
tripple
base
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
dam
tasty
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
beer
not
quite
what
i
would
expect
from
and
ipa
or
from
a
tripel
but
this
is
one
damn
good
beer
no
matter
what
style
you
condemn
it
to
i
will
definitely
be
picking
more
of
this
one
up
since
its
now
available
in
omaha
thanks
to
beertopia
pours
a

wish
more
breweries
would
create
hybrids
like
this
whatever
you
want
to
call
this
guy
id
say
this
is
good
stuff
drinkability
this
one
went
down
surprisingly
quickly
not
as
noticeable
as
some
other
9
beers
before
i
knew
it
i
was
finishing
up
my
third
and
final
pour
of
the
bottle
craving
another
glassful
overall
drinkability
is
fine
this
is
a
very
unique
solidly
constructed
and
quality
beer
but
just
doesnt
have
the
right
balance
or
transition
for
me
drinkability
this
is
complex
and
pleasant
on
every
level
its
much
easier
to
drink
than
its
abv
has
any
right
to
be
938
drinkability
very
quaffable
but
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
this
beer
truly
is
one
of
a
kind
mouthfeel
is
extremely
carbonated
perhaps
too
much
so
and
rather
prickly
drinkability
is
good
but
slow
the
taste
and
drinkability
dont
live
up
to
the
head
and
nose
of
this
beer
drinkability
this
one
is
a
real
gem
i
have
to
brew
something
like
this
soon
dobbelen
ipa
tripel
a
british
ale
style
with
belgian
yeast
and
american
and
czech
hops
whod
have
thought
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
bodied
creamy
smooth
texture
it
was
interesting
but
i
dont
feel
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
warming
notes
of
alcohol
waft
up
through
my
nasal
ducts
as
i
sip
this
brew
it
is
not
sharply
alcoholic
and
in
fact
hides
its
alcohol
quite
well
but
there
is
that
warming
in
the
nose
that
lets
you
know
that
this
beer
will
bite
you
if
you
dont
watch
out
the
balance
that
this
beer
strikes
is
really
the
wonderful
thing
about
this
beer
soft
creamy
and
enticing
yet
at
the
same
time
bitingly
bitter
with
ample
hop
notes
and
the
ample
meringue
like
head
is
as
good
as
it
gets
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
is
quite
well
integrated
the
sum
of
its
parts
tasty
as
they
may
be
still
add
up
to
a
greater
whole
than
one
my
expect
because
of
the
9
abv
one
should
drink
this
slow
and
enjoy
one
at
a
time
well
worth
getting
again
and
again
if
you
can
i
think
its
hard
for
this
beer
to
match
its
aroma
in
taste
not
that
it
was
a
letdown
in
any
way
because
this
is
an
excellent
beer
eh
what
the
hell
ill
match
the
taste
and
aroma
scorewise
very
interesting
and
well
done
i
had
this
on
tap
at
pitchers
pub
in
cumberland
ri
and
ever
since
this
is
the
first
drink
that
i
ask
for
when
i
see
it
on
tap
the
apperance
is
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
flat
plain
the
taste
and
smell
are
both
exceptional
with
the
hop
and
citrus
prresents
well
known
with
9alc
this
beer
should
be
enjoyed
slowly
for
it
will
cetainly
put
a
smile
on
your
face
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
nose
is
all
about
hops
citrus
grapefruit
and
some
earthy
aromas
rounding
out
the
edge
the
taste
hits
you
over
the
head
with
hops
but
the
malt
balances
it
out
quickly
before
it
becomes
overbearing
finishes
citrusy
orange
grapefruit
and
a
bit
bready
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
long
finish
this
beer
is
quite
fruity
and
spicy
like
a
saison
it
has
a
nice
not
overpowering
hoppy
kick
to
it
as
well
very
nice
for
a
belgian
brew
slight
yeastiness
leasds
to
a
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
this
beer
goes
down
so
smoot
for
about
10
for
a
750
ml
bottle
this
is
a
beer
i
will
always
want
more
of
slightly
hazed
golden
bigass
white
crown
of
froth
it
becomes
quite
rocky
as
it
recedes
and
leaves
great
webs
of
lace
great
nose
not
exactly
an
ipa
nose
but
still
a
great
nose
i
can
pick
out
more
of
the
saaz
on
the
nose
than
the
rillos
doesnt
matter
i
love
the
smell
of
both
but
theres
also
a
nice
belgian
biscuity
malt
aroma
that
blends
in
nicely
a
very
warm
and
comforting
aroma
onto
the
flavor
nice
interesting
and
unique
unlike
any
beer
that
i
can
remember
off
the
top
of
my
head
its
got
the
great
hop
attributes
albeit
slightly
different
than
the
hop
bombs
of
america
but
also
this
great
underlying
belgian
matliness
and
yeastiness
bready
biscuity
warming
ive
heard
of
comfort
food
well
this
is
comfort
beer
a
beer
that
would
be
outstanding
on
a
cool
cloudy
late
autumn
day
with
a
fire
going
and
a
good
football
game
on
and
good
food
cooking
in
the
kitchen
this
would
be
the
perfect
beer
for
thanksgiving
i
may
have
to
get
some
more
d
damn
this
is
such
a
fine
beer
wow
id
drink
this
again
and
again
and
again
a
favorite
for
both
of
us
highly
recommended
among
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
regardless
of
style
next
challenge
homebrew
clone
of
this
this
belgian
double
ipa
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
white
foam
that
slowly
settled
and
coated
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
belgian
malt
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
and
some
grape
skins
together
with
a
nice
hoppiness
the
taste
was
a
basic
belgian
maltiness
with
a
touch
of
sugar
sweetness
together
with
a
vinous
grapeskin
flavor
and
layered
with
a
rather
strong
hoppiness
but
not
an
overpoweringly
bitter
hoppiness
overall
a
very
nice
flavor
combination
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
lightly
sweet
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
feel
the
finish
left
the
flavors
of
grapeskins
and
hops
lingering
pleasantly
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
reminiscent
of
deranke
xx
bitter
cheers
what
a
beer
this
has
so
many
flavors
and
smells
that
my
crappy
writing
cant
do
it
justice
but
i
will
try
the
body
is
slightly
cloudy
yelloworange
with
massive
creamy
white
head
the
head
itself
had
a
very
citrusy
and
piney
hop
taste
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
on
the
smell
is
a
lemon
pound
cake
i
also
smell
some
spicy
cloves
or
black
pepper
and
there
is
a
little
grapefruit
hidden
in
there
too
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
it
starts
with
citrus
then
bready
malts
with
a
nice
bitter
ending
the
bitter
ending
is
great
with
the
sweet
citrus
beginning
and
malty
middle
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
warning
stop
pouring
this
beer
early
as
i
got
2
inches
of
beer
and
6
inches
of
head
which
is
a
huge
foamy
off
white
body
is
a
yellow
hazy
straw
colored
hue
lace
is
left
thick
on
the
glass
as
the
foam
fades
at
about
an
inch
every
4
minutes
or
so
wow
nose
is
a
nice
wheat
and
soft
hop
mix
i
was
amazed
at
how
smooth
and
balanced
this
was
with
a
silkey
belgium
feel
mingled
with
a
nice
mix
of
hops
hop
heads
and
belgium
fans
unite
notes
of
vanilla
and
mellon
exist
finish
is
clean
mouthfeel
is
welcomed
very
surprisingly
drinkable
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
poured
to
a
bright
golden
color
with
possibly
the
thickest
most
pillowy
offwhte
head
i
have
ever
seen
head
lingered
thru
entire
glass
and
slowly
reduced
to
excellent
lacing
aroma
was
a
very
hoppy
citrus
lemon
and
grapefruit
taste
was
hoppy
citrus
bitterness
but
with
just
enough
malt
to
take
the
edge
off
palate
was
smooth
and
warming
as
9
alcohol
made
itself
known
this
beer
was
quite
a
treat
great
beer
what
a
unique
treat
no
doubt
ill
be
seeking
this
out
again
belgian
tripel
with
hops
yes
its
unusual
its
exciting
its
wellrounded
and
balanced
and
drinkable
superb
the
houblon
is
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
of
the
achouffe
line
magnificent
if
it
wasnt
9
i
could
drink
this
all
of
the
time
zum
wohl
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
which
looks
like
a
great
idea
as
the
head
on
this
one
is
huge
as
foretold
by
the
exploding
bottle
which
had
been
dormant
for
a
few
weeks
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
wit
a
giant
chunky
foamy
head
by
chunky
i
mean
not
level
aromas
of
banana
and
alcohol
are
dominant
taste
is
bitter
hops
with
banana
and
citrus
with
some
maltiness
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
but
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
alcohol
pours
a
hazed
straw
yellow
with
a
huge
head
of
white
foam
the
head
slowly
settled
into
a
very
weird
glob
of
thicker
foam
in
the
center
of
glass
it
looks
like
a
spoon
full
of
marshmallow
fluff
was
dropped
into
my
glass
that
eventually
faded
into
the
belly
of
the
beer
leaving
behind
about
4
inches
of
lacing
and
a
ring
of
foam
around
the
glass
with
pockets
of
offwhite
fizz
in
the
center
smells
of
cloves
creamy
malts
and
estery
banana
with
a
backbone
of
citrus
hops
starts
with
a
light
sweetness
with
some
spice
hops
come
out
in
a
bitter
finish
earthier
hops
than
the
ones
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
airy
and
light
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
definitely
not
as
weird
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
much
better
than
urthel
attempt
in
my
opinion
i
would
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
great
job
to
the
brewmaster
for
thinking
outside
the
norm
you
know
what
sucks
i
only
have
an
11
2oz
bottle
and
i
am
almost
finished
with
it
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
is
it
a
tripel
no
is
it
an
ipa
no
is
it
another
kick
ass
beer
from
achouffe
oh
yeah
i
love
this
brewery
and
this
beer
has
lived
up
to
my
internal
hype
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
american
hop
influence
but
this
beer
rocks
as
is

thank
you
bill
i
loved
every
drop
drinkability
the
alcohol
recognition
really
doesnt
come
into
play
for
me
as
the
quality
and
balance
of
this
brew
is
amazing
also
at
around
9
a
bottle
the
price
range
i
think
is
very
affordable
it
paired
very
well
with
my
spicy
shrimp
and
penne
pasta
and
made
me
feel
like
i
was
drinking
a
fine
wine
with
it
when
really
id
much
rather
have
something
like
this
brew
to
accompany
the
dish
i
waited
way
too
long
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
so
i
hope
i
can
find
more
and
stash
a
bunch
away
id
love
to
see
what
happens
after
some
time
in
the
cellar
but
damn
this
stuff
is
fantastic
and
i
cant
say
enough
about
it
d
very
good
i
think
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
for
any
acclimated
to
the
style
not
overwhelming
in
the
hop
sugar
or
alcohol
categories
like
some
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
from
a
tripel
very
effervescent
on
the
tongue
crisp
and
clean
i
could
actually
drink
this
all
day
i
know
its
9
but
i
couldnt
really
tell
a
good
showing
this
one
this
beer
is
excellent
although
it
is
strong
and
complex
the
bready
malt
makes
it
still
seem
lighter
and
the
mix
of
flavors
keeps
you
interested
making
the
drinkability
almost
dangerous
its
so
damn
good
this
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
yellow
color
with
one
of
the
largest
heads
ive
ever
seen
if
its
poured
with
any
vigor
this
beer
will
explode
in
a
white
foamy
head
and
will
not
stop
growing
the
smell
is
much
like
you
would
expect
from
a
tripelipa
mostly
a
sweetly
spiced
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
incredible
but
this
is
a
synthesis
of
my
two
favorite
beer
types
so
its
pretty
much
a
dream
come
true
for
the
first
34th
of
the
beer
its
just
like
a
lightly
spiced
tripel
but
toward
the
end
there
is
just
a
kiss
of
the
bitter
hops
that
you
would
expect
out
of
an
ipa
i
wouldnt
normally
equate
these
beers
together
but
they
are
able
to
seamlessly
take
the
best
qualities
of
both
and
make
one
incredible
beer
very
impressed
this
is
truly
a
outstanding
beer
perfect
for
savoring
with
a
cheese
plate
i
really
dig
the
uniqueness
if
this
beer
an
incredibly
balanced
be
for
what
it
is
a
little
pricy
but
worth
a
one
shot
without
a
doubt
notes
you
get
what
you
pay
for
sometimes
and
in
this
case
its
worth
every
cent
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
that
its
got
all
the
goodness
of
a
superb
belgian
tripel
w
an
american
hop
twister
on
the
frontside
that
actually
blends
well
uf
pours
clear
pale
yellow
with
showy
white
head
and
heavy
lace
aroma
is
a
strong
point
saaz
hops
and
chouffels
belgian
yeast
to
linger
over
before
moving
on
to
a
citric
lightmedium
body
featuring
a
balance
of
malt
with
the
typical
belgian
flavors
spiced
with
tangy
citrusorange
american
amarillotomahawlk
hops
after
a
little
competition
for
which
will
dominate
the
aftertaste
a
clean
hop
finish
ends
i
will
repeat
this
one
hazy
lemon
amber
towering
head
of
fine
creamlike
eggshell
bubbles
that
stands
for
a
long
time
before
settling
to
a
still
quite
tall
cap
the
foam
tastes
like
hop
cream
and
you
could
spoon
it
into
a
bowl
and
eat
it
by
itself
huge
thick
bands
of
lacing
grace
the
glass
there
are
a
few
stray
carbonation
streams
the
aromatics
are
distinctly
belgian
triple
with
crunchy
white
fruit
as
well
as
nicely
suggestive
of
a
double
ipa
with
spicy
citrusy
orangey
hops
there
is
also
a
bit
of
alcohol
that
shines
through
the
alcohol
edge
is
distinct
from
the
first
taste
but
it
meshes
well
with
a
the
fruit
crispness
of
the
triple
it
is
warming
and
slightly
sweet
before
the
hops
take
over
they
are
both
boldly
spicy
and
citrus
rindy
with
a
nice
long
lasting
finish
there
is
a
slightly
resinous
element
to
them
as
well
medium
body
with
a
light
mouthfeel
that
is
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
blend
of
a
triple
and
a
double
ipa
highly
drinkable
the
aromatics
were
top
notch
and
i
could
have
gone
through
several
more
bottles
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
next
release
of
this
fantastic
beer
this
brew
is
intruiging
difficult
to
discern
any
one
flavour
this
is
one
ill
come
back
to
time
and
time
again
as
my
tastes
evolve
overall
this
is
a
great
artisinal
beer
though
might
be
a
bit
too
raw
for
some
people
if
you
like
ipas
and
tripels
you
will
love
this
beer
which
combines
both
into
one
a
very
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
cheers
but
overall
a
pleasant
experience
nothing
id
really
seek
out
but
i
certainly
dont
regret
it
overall
a
very
drinkable
ale
remarkable
in
its
simplicity
and
in
its
complexity
outstanding
finally
got
my
hands
on
some
of
this
pours
outrageously
with
a
giant
rocky
head
of
fluffy
soft
white
body
is
pale
straw
lemon
with
a
faint
haze
the
glass
is
cobwebbed
with
lace
powdered
sugar
orvaltart
yeastiness
and
a
big
citrusy
seaair
wall
of
hop
juice
bitterness
interesting
and
inviting
sugary
fruit
sweetness
up
front
with
wheaty
malt
soft
moderate
feel
witha
very
dry
peppery
finish
hops
come
on
strong
but
not
american
dipa
strong
hops
are
citrusy
and
tart
refreshing
and
bitter
along
with
de
ranke
xx
bitter
perhaps
the
hoppiest
belgian
brew
ive
had
pretty
good
too
d
this
is
one
of
those
epic
ales
that
i
will
always
remember
and
want
to
go
back
to
right
up
there
with
xx
bitter
yet
a
boat
load
more
hops
got
this
item
at
maxs
on
caseys
advice
a
goblet
full
of
bright
golden
liquid
topped
with
marshmellow
fluff
not
a
very
bold
aroma
but
nice
super
flavors
and
great
balance
with
just
the
right
touch
of
carbonation
to
enhance
smooth
clean
and
complex
finish
with
the
alcohol
heft
neatly
masked
incredibly
drinkable
for
all
that
beer
wow
mouthfeel
is
loose
but
not
too
light
with
the
heavy
carbonation
it
makes
the
long
list
of
flavors
more
drinkable
nifty
and
a
little
dangerous
at
this
abv
lots
of
fun
and
a
good
recommendation
to
adventurous
nonbeersnob
types
i
went
out
the
next
day
and
bought
more
i
love
this
one
drinkability
is
great
the
hops
greatly
improve
the
style
for
me
anyway
medium
bodied
with
an
excellent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
that
makes
this
stuff
almost
dangerous
so
smooth
and
flavorful
you
really
dont
even
notice
the
alcohol
sneaking
up
on
you
a
tripel
for
hop
lovers
as
only
the
belgians
can
do
it
definitely
recommended
drinkability
enjoyable
to
consume
though
not
to
the
same
degree
as
a
traditional
tripel
fine
brew
i
love
the
hoppiness
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
with
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smell
is
fruitty
and
floral
with
a
nice
sweetness
taste
is
initially
like
an
ipa
with
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
nice
citrus
presence
followed
by
more
of
a
belgian
taste
with
a
little
carmel
and
fruit
this
is
great
i
love
the
combo
of
the
two
styles
it
is
very
drinkable
and
this
will
definitely
be
a
repeat
purchase
hoppy
chouffe
is
not
too
hoppy
these
hoppy
belgian
beers
havent
been
too
hoppy
as
far
as
i
can
tell
but
this
one
is
still
quite
nice
and
possibly
a
bit
better
than
the
urthel
affair
dark
golden
in
colour
with
a
nice
offwhite
fluffy
cap
of
foam
on
top
aromas
of
zest
floral
piney
hops
candy
sugar
sweetness
and
sugar
cooke
malts
all
blending
together
to
make
a
sweet
and
well
integrated
hoppy
belgian
beer
that
is
not
too
hoppy
taste
is
sweet
and
sugary
with
some
nice
piney
hop
notes
and
wonderful
malt
complexity
mouthfeel
is
zesty
and
spirtzy
not
too
thick
or
filling
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
just
wish
a
hoppier
belgian
beer
would
come
out
this
is
very
different
and
very
good
beer
i
love
it
when
a
brewery
can
make
something
altogether
different
edit
warning
the
wellhidden
alcohol
hits
all
at
once
when
youve
finished
the
750
ml
im
very
happy
now
the
name
and
the
bottle
intrigued
me
and
i
am
not
disappointed
that
i
purchased
this
brew
im
going
to
seek
out
as
many
more
as
i
can
purchase
tomorrow
truly
this
is
a
divine
nectar
that
is
worthy
of
praise
note
easily
in
my
top
ten
a
completely
unique
and
stunning
beer
makes
me
literally
want
to
shed
a
tear
thinking
how
much
care
went
into
producing
this
incredible
brew
from
a
large
corked
bottle
this
brew
pours
a
light
translucent
orange
color
yellow
at
the
edges
with
a
nice
thick
head
and
a
bit
of
haze
the
aroma
is
of
resinlike
and
cirtic
hops
backed
with
a
lot
of
esters
and
yeast
smells
theres
a
lot
of
grassiness
and
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
smell
as
well
mingled
with
bread
and
a
little
ethanol
the
alcohol
aroma
is
a
pretty
well
hidden
given
the
abv
the
first
sensation
when
you
drink
this
beer
is
the
high
carbonation
following
that
is
an
earthy
yeasty
flavor
backed
by
lots
of
grapefruitlike
and
pinelike
hops
the
alcohol
warming
sets
in
pretty
earlyon
in
this
beer
its
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
was
very
satisfied
with
this
beerlots
of
hops
in
belgian
garb
interesting
and
worth
having
again
750
ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
orange
color
with
a
huge
sticky
head
that
clings
to
my
glass
spicy
yeast
and
citrus
aroma
apple
honey
lemon
and
spice
flavors
full
bodied
with
nice
crisp
and
carbonated
mouthfeel
very
different
and
tasty
hard
to
believe
its
9
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
light
and
relatively
clean
a
strange
hybrid
style
this
offspring
of
a
mild
ipa
and
a
belgian
tripel
probably
my
favorite
of
the
chouffe
brand
to
appear
locally
i
have
never
had
anything
like
this
before
totally
unique
totally
quaffable
awesome
d
very
easily
downed
i
like
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
great
after
a
long
hot
days
work
drinks
too
easy
almost
a
perfect
beer
imo
tripple
purists
may
take
offense
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
treat
from
my
favorite
belgian
brewery
d
this
beer
is
a
something
else
triples
are
my
least
favorite
belgian
style
but
this
one
im
a
fan
of
quite
original
and
enjoyable
finally
traditional
the
belgian
style
and
contemporary
the
massive
use
of
hops
styles
come
together
and
create
something
that
isnt
awful
pours
a
light
honey
with
a
haze
two
finger
sudsy
white
cap
that
slowly
fell
into
a
low
rocky
top
aroma
is
fruity
esters
of
pear
and
banana
clove
light
biscuit
and
yeast
a
little
citrus
and
alcohol
is
in
the
nose
flavor
was
very
similiar
to
aroma
fruity
sweetness
of
banana
and
clove
light
grain
and
a
little
pepper
slight
sulpher
in
background
there
is
the
hops
in
back
of
the
throat
citrusy
and
grapefruit
body
is
medium
with
medhigh
carbonation
finishes
dry
interesting
combination
of
styles
but
blends
very
well
in
a
nice
quaffable
or
sipping
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
with
a
large
puffy
white
head
on
top
with
a
pale
golden
color
settling
in
the
glass
at
first
scent
you
think
where
did
this
beer
come
from
strong
hop
scents
start
out
nothing
to
overbearing
though
then
the
belgian
pale
malt
and
yeast
aromas
become
prevalent
and
assert
the
fruity
scents
typical
with
belgian
beers
the
taste
starts
with
those
hops
that
come
across
the
palate
bring
some
bitterness
but
it
soon
blended
away
to
the
wonderful
belgian
fruitiness
and
sweetness
at
the
end
it
is
light
in
the
mouth
not
to
watery
this
is
truely
a
unique
beer
a
great
experimentaion
in
flavors
and
yet
seems
very
easy
to
drink
a
must
try
in
the
end
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
this
style
i
think
this
beer
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
it
tastes
and
looks
great
but
it
is
just
a
little
high
in
alcohol
it
is
definately
worth
trying
though
poured
out
of
a
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
poured
slowly
still
creating
an
immense
frothy
whipped
creamy
head
unlike
any
other
head
i
have
experienced
even
more
frothy
thicker
than
an
old
ruffian
as
the
beer
was
going
down
in
the
glass
it
left
an
incredible
thick
creamy
lacing
all
over
the
glass
i
dont
know
if
id
even
call
it
lacing
as
much
as
a
complete
whiteout
of
the
glass
what
an
aesthetic
work
of
art
this
brew
is
appearance
was
pretty
cloudy
light
copper
color
smelled
of
belgian
yeast
tropical
fruitinesscitrus
honeydew
and
coriander
taste
was
complicated
unlike
a
lot
of
things
i
have
had
before
yet
all
too
familiar
i
guess
you
can
definitely
call
it
a
tripelipa
the
taste
reminded
me
of
westmalle
tripel
tropical
fruits
and
yeast
up
front
coriander
then
the
hop
bitterness
kicks
in
a
bit
but
nothing
overwhelming
my
only
beef
with
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
that
the
alcohol
presence
is
a
little
too
overwhelming
it
subdues
a
tad
bringing
out
the
fruitiness
of
the
beer
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
but
still
is
very
prevalent
perhaps
this
beer
would
be
better
aged
a
year
or
two
imho
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
velvety
very
refreshing
with
medium
carbonation
i
may
cellar
this
one
and
comparecontrast
my
views
mouthfeel
is
thick
liquid
velvet
decadentfeeling
and
yet
somehow
light
on
the
palate
though
the
overall
richness
makes
this
a
sippingbeer
alcohol
goes
almost
completely
undetected
which
is
dangerous
considering
the
abv
while
quite
good
the
9
plus
the
chewy
texture
makes
this
a
oneglass
beer
for
me
drinkability
great
bottle
poured
a
deep
dirty
and
hazy
yellow
color
ale
with
a
super
huge
pure
white
foamy
head
with
absolutely
perfect
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
floral
hops
is
quite
intense
with
what
i
think
are
saaz
hops
really
taking
over
this
wonderful
mix
taste
when
beer
is
slightly
below
room
temperature
is
akin
to
a
wonderful
triple
westmalle
moinette
with
some
added
floral
undertones
when
beer
gets
at
about
room
temperature
the
hops
really
comes
out
and
provide
a
bitter
finish
which
i
enjoyed
a
bit
less
nonetheless
this
is
a
great
experience
and
would
probably
try
this
again
even
though
price
is
a
bit
high
imo
for
this
beer
drinkabilityoverall
a
very
unique
americanbelgian
hybrid
created
with
the
utmost
style
and
grace
an
elegant
blend
of
fruity
esters
dry
yeast
and
juicy
yet
restrained
hops
that
show
all
of
their
flavor
without
an
astringent
bitterness
simply
a
delight
to
drink
drinkability
this
is
a
real
treat
all
the
wonderful
flavor
and
complexity
of
la
chouffe
with
a
wonderfully
balanced
hops
bristle
the
hops
are
a
little
light
for
the
dobbelen
ipa
end
of
things
but
this
balances
the
tripel
flavor
nicely
and
develops
a
truly
unique
beer
ill
be
sure
to
drink
more
of
this
while
i
can
drinkability
this
is
definitely
more
tripel
than
it
is
ipa
but
it
is
really
an
interesting
experiment
with
beautiful
results
highly
drinkable
but
be
careful
the
9
is
wellhidden
and
highly
recommended
and
it
matched
perfectly
with
this

htm200303
while
i
enjoy
the
beer
i
do
not
find
it
to
be
imminently
drinkable
although
it
manages
to
hide
the
abv
quite
well
as
i
mentioned
a
very
interesting
brew
and
although
im
not
sure
how
soon
ill
be
purchasing
this
one
again
it
is
great
to
see
other
countries
experimenting
with
styles
the
way
the
us
does
thumbs
up
to
the
gnome
drinkability
a
unique
melding
of
two
styles
certainly
more
tripel
than
ipa
but
i
like
the
results
the
high
alcohol
content
and
price
makes
this
an
occasional
beer
for
me
rather
than
a
go
to
brew
its
hard
drinking
this
not
thinking
youre
drinking
an
experiment
which
is
strange
as
it
so
very
subtle
a
good
tasting
beer
but
generally
in
the
10
range
for
a
750
ml
likely
one
i
wont
revisit
often
this
is
a
solid
and
entirely
unique
snifter
a
good
beer
and
one
to
try
for
someone
interested
in
something
in
a
league
or
style
of
its
own
d
went
down
easily
enough
a
good
beer
definitely
intresting
and
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
both
the
styles
like
myself
after
the
head
settles
and
i
can
get
my
lips
on
this
one
the
flavors
that
shine
through
are
only
mildly
hoppy
a
combo
of
saaz
amarillo
and
tomahawk
with
a
pleasant
fruity
backbone
alcohol
is
kept
nicely
in
check
and
just
barely
noticeable
in
the
dry
finish
a
quality
beer
though
not
truly
an
ipa
or
a
tripel
pours
clear
golden
straw
color
with
big
airy
white
head
very
persistent
lace
and
slow
carbonation
smells
of
earthy
yeast
some
barnyard
funk
tangy
hops
lemon
and
orange
zest
fruitiness
flavor
is
an
interesting
interplay
of
typical
tripel
fruitiness
with
american
hops
starts
with
coarse
graininess
builds
sweet
tropical
citrus
and
banana
flavors
in
the
center
finishes
with
pepper
yeast
rough
grapefruit
hops
and
quenching
mouthpuckering
dryness
lighter
easierdrinking
and
more
carbonated
than
expected
in
the
mouth
surprisingly
appetizing
and
successful
absolutely
gorgeous
beer
this
is
my
first
time
to
try
it
and
i
find
it
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
yum
a
huge
white
head
explodes
off
a
pale
straw
colored
beer
with
an
obvious
amount
of
carbonation
the
head
never
completely
disappears
leaving
a
remarkable
merenguelike
substance
that
clings
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
this
is
an
ipa
belgianstyle
which
is
to
say
extremely
interesting
loaded
with
amarillo
tomahawk
and
saaz
the
aroma
is
actually
dominated
by
the
typical
belgian
tripel
qualities
spicy
a
bit
fruity
with
that
lovely
yeastiness
that
defines
the
style
the
hops
are
there
but
in
the
background
the
taste
is
a
marvel
at
first
extermely
tripellike
sweet
and
yeasty
and
spicy
the
load
of
hops
quickly
comes
to
the
fore
with
a
dominating
bitterness
and
a
nice
hop
flavor
towards
the
finish
the
sweetness
comes
back
and
dances
around
the
hop
bitterness
very
drinkable
i
didnt
have
a
problem
finishing
the
750
by
myself
the
mouthfeel
is
bouyed
by
a
blast
of
carbonation
this
is
an
extermely
interesting
beer
im
not
sure
it
would
ever
be
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
when
in
the
mood
for
something
a
bit
experimental
its
great
the
drinkability
for
me
was
way
down
since
it
found
the
flavor
so
trying
i
appreciate
the
creativity
of
this
beer
but
i
just
felt
like
it
was
the
wrong
combination
of
styles
and
at
least
of
hops
i
want
to
try
a
something
like
this
with
more
citrus
flavored
hops
and
less
pinelike
ones
in
the
meantime
this
is
a
terrific
beer
from
a
classic
artisinal
ardennes
brewery
a
must
try
in
my
book
enjoy
houblon
chouffe
dobbelen
ipa
tripel
even
though
it
contains
at
least
three
different
styles
in
its
name
is
a
singular
creation
by
a
master
belgian
brewer
some
will
discount
overthetop
hoppiness
as
a
passing
fad
but
in
the
right
hands
and
the
hands
at
brasserie
dachouffe
are
some
of
the
most
capable
that
youll
find
it
turns
great
beer
into
transcendent
beer
houblon
chouffe
looks
like
a
masterpiece
and
drinks
like
a
dream
now
i
need
to
go
find
this
on
tap
it
goes
down
easier
considering
its
fullness
and
its
alcohol
content
but
its
made
to
savor
great
brew
if
you
ask
me
beer
is
good
happy
new
adventurous
beering
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
two
styles
from
this
brewery
that
are
available
to
me
after
its
disinterment
from
the
750ml
brown
bottle
it
sets
in
the
glass
a
bemused
golden
yellow
with
a
demonstrative
creamy
off
white
head
that
settles
slowly
forming
a
glutinous
coating
of
lace
nose
is
dominated
by
the
grassy
hop
floral
aroma
banana
like
pepper
and
orange
peel
citrus
like
in
its
crispness
start
is
sweet
with
a
delightful
grain
presence
and
the
top
moderate
in
its
feel
finish
is
prickly
in
its
acidity
the
hops
potent
with
a
desert
dry
aftertaste
that
welds
itself
to
your
palate
a
beer
with
multiple
personalities
i
found
if
quite
drinkable
different
for
sure
i
like
these
new
hoppy
belgian
beers
that
are
starting
to
come
out
this
still
has
a
lot
of
the
character
of
a
good
belgian
ale
and
the
twist
of
high
hops
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
easy
going
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
creamy
sensation
as
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
the
alcohol
is
not
at
all
apparent
in
the
brew
overall
this
is
a
tasty
unique
special
brew
from
achouffe
not
something
i
see
myself
drinking
all
the
time
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
its
fun
to
see
more
belgian
brewers
embracing
the
hops
check
this
one
out
if
you
run
across
it
for
sure
this
is
a
great
beer
but
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expect
i
really
enjoyed
this
for
a
great
belgian
though
and
ill
more
than
likely
revisit
this
one
750
ml
bottle
thanks
to
imstillthegman
and
bif
33
pours
with
a
merangue
head
and
its
huge
litereally
about
8090
of
the
glass
if
foam
overcabonated
aroma
is
nice
piney
for
a
triple
perhaps
leaning
towards
ipa
taste
is
sweet
piney
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
thin
carbonation
gets
in
the
way
its
plenty
interesting
but
ive
had
better
from
this
style
a
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
slight
haze
has
a
magnificent
huge
creamy
white
head
with
great
lace
the
aroma
at
first
is
piney
with
a
hint
of
lemon
in
the
background
the
citrusy
lemon
character
then
transforms
into
a
hard
lemon
candy
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
way
in
the
back
only
a
belgian
ale
could
make
your
tastebuds
do
the
jumping
around
that
this
beer
does
hoppy
malty
citrusy
peppery
every
mouthful
a
new
experiance
hints
of
sugar
candy
on
the
side
of
your
tongue
with
a
nice
sharp
dry
finish
taste
has
a
lemon
pithrind
character
and
old
hops
with
a
background
of
oil
of
bergamot
and
a
black
tea
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
has
a
tannic
bitterness
as
it
warms
i
get
a
bit
of
a
sweet
bubblegum
flavor
and
some
mintinessmarigold
smell
very
interesting
very
drinkable
poured
like
a
classic
belgian
beer
with
an
enourmous
pillowwhite
head
that
filled
a
good
half
of
my
tulip
glass
as
the
beer
began
to
breathe
crags
and
valleys
and
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
appeared
above
a
straw
wheat
gold
body
this
beer
looked
like
everything
a
beer
should
look
like
perhaps
the
weekest
part
of
the
dobbelen
was
the
nose
it
offered
little
in
the
way
of
creativity
with
perhaps
some
slight
whiffs
of
the
saaz
hops
and
a
bit
of
barnyardy
grass
but
nothing
really
overpowering
the
taste
however
was
crisp
refreshing
full
of
the
interesting
mixture
of
belgian
tripel
with
its
creamcicle
like
flavors
and
the
ipa
character
replete
with
a
hoppy
bite
and
a
bittering
finish
very
flavorful
and
worth
drinking
drinkability
what
an
interesting
beer
a
hopped
up
belgian
trippel
a
nice
blend
of
hop
bitterness
intermingled
with
a
fruity
and
flowery
sweetness
dry
to
the
bone
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
and
more
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
profile
but
you
can
feel
its
warming
effects
easy
to
drink
and
one
i
will
be
buying
again
very
unique
seek
this
very
interesting
take
on
a
tripple
and
enjoy
drinkability
this
is
good
goes
down
well
but
high
abv
limits
to
one
in
a
session
as
much
as
i
like
this
one
i
will
still
take
de
ranke
xx
bitter
as
my
favorite
of
hoppy
belgian
beers
nonetheless
this
one
is
highly
recommended
d
good
i
wish
i
had
normal
access
to
this
beer
this
brew
has
an
active
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
taste
is
slightly
peppery
with
a
hop
presence
that
is
quite
green
undertones
of
banana
and
citrus
are
evident
drink
ends
with
a
splash
of
prickly
bitter
hop
carbonation
while
yielding
a
dry
tonic
water
finish
not
too
bad
all
in
all
the
hop
bitterness
is
the
story
here
absolutely
no
help
from
constituent
ingredients
to
help
quell
the
bitter
beast
which
is
the
hop
balance
or
should
i
say
lack
thereof
still
this
brew
has
something
to
offer
as
the
nuances
underneath
the
hop
current
are
varied
and
interesting
well
worth
a
try
all
things
considered
the
750
did
drain
quite
quickly
overall
impression
it
is
slightly
annoying
after
awhile
to
wait
once
again
for
the
massive
head
to
slowly
drop
into
its
malleable
blob
but
in
the
end
its
worth
the
wait
i
really
enjoyed
the
citric
lemon
aspect
and
the
unusual
combination
of
worlds
this
is
a
solid
choice
for
review
600
recommended
but
with
all
the
talk
of
the
hops
factor
in
this
one
im
still
not
convinced
the
belgians
either
1
know
how
to
or
2
care
to
mirror
the
ultrahopped
ipas
that
this
was
apparently
inspired
by
no
matter
this
has
all
the
complexity
and
satisfaction
that
the
best
tripels
should
deliver
its
different
and
the
wellhidden
alcohol
and
creamyfruity
elements
makes
this
almost
too
easy
to
drink
would
be
great
to
try
this
on
tap
or
right
at
the
brewery
because
i
feel
like
im
too
new
to
houblon
to
glean
its
deepest
subtleties
a
beguiling
and
intruiging
ale
for
sure
an
interesting
concoction
to
say
the
least
the
alcohol
presence
seems
to
be
a
bit
heavy
with
a
lack
of
balance
at
times
this
is
probably
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
indulging
in
this
belgian
more
often
drinkability
another
quality
brew
by
la
chouffe
this
one
will
be
purchased
again
in
the
future
drinkability
is
decent
but
for
the
price
i
will
pass
on
this
one
next
time
there
are
better
hoppy
belgian
ales
out
there
this
one
is
an
interesting
effort
but
just
doesnt
work
for
me
malt
balance
is
lacking
doesnt
succeed
as
a
morphed
tripel
or
ipa
despite
that
i
detected
aromas
of
honey
hard
candy
yeast
and
freshly
cut
grass
the
taste
was
very
much
in
line
with
what
might
be
expected
from
a
tripel
with
subtle
bitterness
underneath
good
texture
with
a
slightly
astringent
finish
overall
this
beer
was
smooth
and
sour
with
a
rich
and
flavorful
profile
dominated
by
various
sweet
flavors
easy
to
sip
and
one
to
enjoy
with
cheese
some
healthy
body
that
gives
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
plus
a
nice
warming
from
the
high
abv
this
is
a
big
beautiful
brew
thats
real
easy
to
drink
but
best
enjoyed
slowly
and
it
aint
cheap
well
done
chouffe
you
win
this
time
you
rogue
this
beer
is
called
an
ipa
and
should
get
respect
for
that
since
evidently
as
the
story
goes
the
brewer
in
belgium
was
inspired
by
ipas
being
brewed
in
california
which
is
epic
but
this
is
not
really
an
ipa
its
a
belgian
saison
beer
the
ipa
reference
aside
from
the
name
comes
from
a
little
bit
of
cascade
aromatics
just
at
the
end
as
you
swallow
the
beer
all
the
same
i
guess
youd
say
that
this
beer
is
unique
among
belgians
but
the
brewer
has
not
created
a
great
new
style
rather
he
has
created
a
very
drinkable
hybrid
i
would
drink
about
12
oz
of
this
beer
but
not
a
full
pint
because
its
a
little
too
sweet
but
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
quaffing
a
stone
ipa
then
a
chouffe
ipa
then
a
pure
hoppiness
or
something
its
stong
enough
to
hold
its
own
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
a
little
dry
but
overall
a
medium
fading
flavor
from
the
tongue
lots
of
grain
and
hop
interplay
pretty
carbonated
but
not
too
thin
on
the
pallate
not
very
drinkable
as
this
bottle
is
being
split
with
my
lady
and
i
doubt
id
be
able
to
polish
off
an
entire
bottle
on
my
own
fine
drinkability
soft
yielding
delightful
and
yummyliscious
it
makes
a
slow
settled
sinking
impression
into
the
mind
with
wonderment
and
awe
as
it
makes
me
ponder
how
a
beer
so
good
could
be
so
dangerous
i
mean
it
made
me
say
something
along
the
lines
of
savoriness
cmon
thats
worth
something
isnt
it
wow
a
lovely
lovely
beer
a
real
winner
by
chouffe
achouffe
is
definitely
on
to
something
here
i
look
forward
to
version

this

great
enjoyed
a
750ml
bottle
on
a
warm
spring
evening
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
a
massive
head
that
lasted
until
i
was
done
i
didnt
get
much
aroma
predominantly
hops
with
some
citrus
taste
was
exceptional
started
slightly
sweet
then
the
hops
kicked
in
and
it
finished
with
some
spicepepper
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
excellent
despite
alcohol
content
i
drink
a
fair
amount
of
belgians
and
this
one
is
not
very
representative
of
the
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
however
it
is
classified
dangerous
beer
because
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
the
only
downfall
i
think
would
be
if
you
dont
care
for
very
hoppy
beers
because
this
one
is
definately
hoppy
a
big
thank
to
alexj
who
not
only
provided
this
beer
at
the
charlotte
beer
pairing
event
but
for
making
some
excellent
chicken
satay
with
homemade
thai
peanut
sauce
im
unsure
how
some
figure
what
to
pair
with
what
but
this
one
just
paired
beautifully
with
the
spices
nice
hazy
appearance
to
it
drinkability
was
good
enough
for
me
to
drink
four
in
a
row
and
i
very
rarely
drink
the
same
beer
twice
in
one
sitting
especially
when
im
at
a
place
with
a
great
selection
like
the
firkin
this
ale
hangs
tight
on
the
palate
sticking
it
out
giving
a
kick
every
inch
of
the
way
but
downable
and
delicious
im
liking
it
and
i
think
ill
like
it
again
and
again
but
then
again
ive
never
met
a
chouffe
i
didnt
like
edit
scores
adjusted
for
batch
2
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
this
beer
just
proves
that
there
couldnt
be
a
better
time
to
beer
a
beer
lover
in
america
not
only
is
the
selection
of
american
micros
seeminly
expanding
by
tenfold
each
year
but
the
brewers
of
the
old
world
are
following
our
lead
the
result
is
an
orgy
of
mouthwatering
american
hops
and
belgian
yeast
complexity
it
tastes
like
citrus
and
bubblegum
not
too
sweet
not
too
dry
just
the
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
which
seems
like
a
bit
more
than
batch
1
to
me
the
head
on
this
beer
is
phenomenal
and
the
lacing
is
amongst
the
thickest
ive
seen
this
is
easily
the
best
use
of
amarillo
hops
ive
had
as
many
amerikuhn
brewers
like
to
use
too
much
of
a
good
thing
in
our
typical
fashion
highly
recommended
to
anybody
if
you
see
the
gnome
bring
him
home
despite
its
strenght
very
very
drinkable
overall
a
superb
ale
it
bursts
with
fresh
hops
but
they
are
nicely
integrated
into
a
spicy
fruity
belgian
yeast
character
i
want
a
case
of
this
its
been
a
while
since
ive
declared
that
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
a
superior
triple
or
an
ipa
a
strange
beer
that
i
can
recommend
as
an
oddity
but
in
truth
the
normal
la
chouffe
is
just
plain
better
this
poured
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
thick
bright
white
head
clumpy
lace
was
left
behind
as
the
glass
was
emptied
the
aroma
was
spicy
bready
and
yeasty
with
a
little
bit
of
lemon
moderate
bitterness
with
plenty
of
bread
and
floral
hops
some
citrus
fruitiness
lemon
and
pleasant
spiciness
bitterness
grew
into
the
finish
a
bit
dry
with
a
lightish
body
supported
by
high
carbonation
mild
alcohol
warmth
pretty
good
thanks
biegaman
notes

this
is
classified
as
a
tripel
but
really
is
a
double
ipatype
of
tripel
as
it
states
on
the
label
i
think
if
i
were
to
rate
this
iaw
strict
belgian
tripel
guidelines
it
would
have
went
down
a
notch
or
two
but
as
long
as
they
are
proclaiming
their
intentions
right
on
the
bottle
i
threw
caution
to
the
wind
and
just
went
for
a
more
openmined
approach
p
s
in
terms
of
rating
grading
this
against
other
tripels
is
really
a
mistake
since
it
attempts
to
carve
out
a
pretty
new
niche
therefore
all
numbers
are
really
a
general
grade
as
are
most
of
my
reviews
i
admit
yet
another
hit
in
my
book
from
these
folks
overall
hmmmso
it
has
a
big
write
up
on
b
uniteds
website
but
i
am
very
surprised
to
see
that
this
new
houblon
chouffe
is
not
even
mentioned
on
the
achouffe
brewery
website
as
of
the
date
of
this
review
at
least
this
i
think
hints
big
style
at
the
target
market
for
this
brew
clearly
the
us
where
i
think
it
will
do
extremely
well
not
so
sure
back
home
though
sure
i
enjoyed
it
but
strip
away
the
fanfare
and
let
all
the
houblontalk
die
down
and
its
a
nice
hoppy
grapefruit
blonde
of
sorts
but
its
low
on
the
ipa
traits
and
its
no
de
ranke
xx
bitter
ill
stick
with
the
latter
for
my
belgian
hop
fix
i
might
be
biased
in
my
review
because
i
love
pale
ales
and
tripels
but
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
the
beer
has
a
beautiful
fluffy
head
that
reminds
me
of
lemon
meringue
pie
in
appearance
the
smell
is
complex
with
the
spicy
yeast
and
piney
hops
making
for
a
really
unique
nose
the
hop
flavor
of
this
beer
is
just
right
not
so
overpowering
as
to
diminish
the
traditional
tripel
flavors
but
its
definitely
there
the
flavors
mingle
with
each
other
with
each
taste
seeming
to
alternate
with
each
sip
sometimes
the
hops
stand
out
sometimes
the
yeast
a
really
great
experiment
by
the
chouffe
and
a
really
fun
beer
to
drink
pours
out
with
a
cloudy
yellow
body
and
a
huge
white
pillowy
head
of
foam
the
head
breaks
down
slowly
leaving
a
mountain
of
foam
in
the
middle
and
covering
the
entire
glass
nice
light
floral
hoppiness
comes
out
in
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
fruit
sweetness
some
light
notes
of
yeast
and
alcohol
a
bit
mild
but
interesting
the
flavor
starts
sweet
with
fruits
before
some
bitter
earthy
hops
and
spices
show
up
some
yeasty
notes
and
light
alcohol
very
interesting
overall
taste
that
was
good
but
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
thick
body
carried
the
flavor
well
it
started
off
easy
drinking
enough
but
by
the
time
i
was
on
the
last
half
of
the
bottle
it
took
a
bit
more
work
to
finish
a
unique
beer
thats
definitely
worth
a
try
and
has
some
interesting
things
going
on
in
it
it
was
drinkable
but
not
something
that
i
would
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
was
very
different
something
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
and
finally
got
a
chance
to
sample
it
it
was
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
thick
belgian
head
some
nice
lacing
fragrance
was
all
floral
very
pleasant
it
had
an
interesting
taste
there
was
a
sweet
citrus
taste
a
hoppy
taste
and
a
spicy
taste
i
thought
it
a
little
discordant
and
am
not
sure
the
ipabelgian
angle
works
that
well
will
have
to
try
it
again
drinkability
i
drank
this
first
in
the
night
and
didnt
feel
the
effects
of
the
high
abv
until
later
in
the
evening
be
warned
it
will
catch
up
to
you
fresh
fruity
esters
slightly
flinty
initially
quite
sweet
but
finishes
dry
and
masks
its
strength
very
well
mediumfull
bodied
robust
carbonation
but
still
soft
on
the
palete
a
unique
and
very
drinkable
take
on
a
tripel
d
this
can
be
imbibed
all
the
time
anywhere
anytime
no
matter
the
season
of
year
or
anything
d
nicely
balanced
unique
beer
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
above
average
good
but
not
something
im
going
to
seek
out
and
order
regularly
d
very
high
a
great
session
beer
especially
for
a
tripel
would
highly
reccommend
great
balance
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
an
unfreakinbelievable
white
head
looks
like
whipped
cream
filling
half
my
goblet
leaves
a
ton
of
lacing
and
a
few
chunks
hanging
onto
the
side
as
well
the
smell
is
of
yeast
slightly
sour
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
and
candied
fruit
lingering
in
the
background
taste
a
lot
like
its
name
perfect
blend
of
the
two
styles
starts
with
a
sweetness
quickly
followed
by
a
spicy
pepper
flavor
before
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
take
over
some
alcohol
warming
felt
on
swallowing
medium
bodied
smooth
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
you
can
tell
the
higher
abv
is
present
in
this
beer
quite
tasty
the
little
chouffe
came
up
with
a
fabulous
recipe
during
his
latest
journey
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
it
has
depth
a
myriad
of
flavors
the
only
flaw
is
that
it
is
slightly
over
carbonated
imo
but
none
the
less
fantastic
i
would
buy
this
again
but
its
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
i
just
dont
have
any
idea
what
to
think
about
it
it
is
definitely
not
what
you
expect
im
curious
to
see
what
this
may
do
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
ipas
shouldnt
be
aged
but
some
belgians
should
what
do
i
do
at
the
very
least
this
beer
gets
the
prettiest
beer
award
in
my
book
that
head
is
just
unbelievable
the
maker
of
this
beer
has
hit
a
bullseye
the
bitter
citric
american
hops
pair
well
with
the
fruity
esters
and
huge
malts
you
taste
the
fruit
for
an
instant
then
the
hops
fruit
hops
and
so
on
and
so
on
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
thick
creamy
and
foamy
the
alcohol
is
barely
perceived
drinkability
is
perfect
i
thought
about
buying
2
of
these
last
thursday
and
only
bought
one
guess
you
know
where
i
am
going
tomorrow
and
crossing
my
fingers
that
one
is
still
there
drinkability
handling
this
bottle
will
not
be
a
chore
this
beer
is
big
and
spicy
very
different
and
the
experimentation
is
welcomed
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
found
it
drinkable
but
in
carefull
moderation
it
nicely
combines
the
aspect
of
a
few
styles
while
maintaining
balance
and
character
the
aroma
is
a
touch
musty
up
front
with
belgian
ale
yeast
some
light
spices
and
a
good
bit
of
floral
hops
palate
is
well
a
hybrid
between
an
ipa
and
a
tripel
sweet
and
mellow
up
front
with
notes
of
light
fruit
and
black
pepper
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
hops
emerge
providing
a
nice
slightly
bitter
finish
along
with
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
body
is
very
nice
light
and
buttery
yet
substantial
enough
to
hold
the
complexity
of
the
palate
easy
to
drink
for
something
so
complex
and
strong
man
i
love
the
gnome
somebody
had
to
marry
the
two
of
the
most
popular
strong
pale
ale
beer
styles
in
the
world
brasserie
dachouffe
from
belgium
finally
did
it
and
the
result
is
a
hybrid
double
ipa
and
tripel
unlike
most
belgian
bombers
this
one
was
simply
crown
capped
with
no
cork
to
pull
as
i
poured
out
the
contents
of
the
green
bomber
into
a
tulip
a
massive
soufflé
like
head
formed
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
reminding
me
very
much
of
duvel
each
time
i
poured
more
liquid
the
head
reappeared
in
its
craggy
peaks
while
the
looks
were
pretty
much
all
belgian
the
aroma
was
more
or
less
balanced
between
the
two
styles
the
hops
were
easily
detectable
by
the
nose
but
were
most
apparently
of
the
floral
saaz
variety
and
not
so
much
the
citric
and
piney
types
found
more
commonly
in
the
dipas
there
was
also
a
yeasty
and
bready
smell
typical
of
many
tripels
as
the
head
died
down
i
could
taste
the
beer
and
the
taste
was
more
dominated
by
hops
than
the
smell
had
led
me
so
far
the
bitterness
of
hops
led
to
a
taste
sensation
that
was
unmistakably
influenced
by
modern
american
brewing
while
not
a
high
alpha
hop
bomb
this
was
clearly
closer
in
taste
to
an
apa
or
a
single
ipa
than
a
tripel
although
the
peppery
spiciness
and
candi
sugar
sweetness
poking
through
from
time
to
time
were
alien
to
those
styles
if
i
had
a
bone
to
pick
here
it
would
be
with
the
readily
apparent
9
abv
normally
its
not
a
bad
thing
for
a
beer
to
be
warming
but
that
is
not
a
typical
characteristic
of
either
of
the
two
styles
being
melded
into
this
concoction
the
mouthfeel
was
light
as
a
result
of
the
sprightly
carbonation
which
was
again
in
the
tripel
territory
this
beer
was
a
bit
underwhelming
to
me
as
a
dipa
as
a
tripel
it
was
a
ballsy
brew
the
seemingly
dual
nature
of
the
experience
was
not
a
problem
with
me
but
some
others
may
find
it
a
bit
incoherent
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
cloudy
golden
with
a
massive
rocky
white
head
and
thick
clumpy
lacing
nose
is
primarily
of
saaz
spiciness
and
typical
belgian
yeast
funk
yknow
green
apples
tannic
grape
skins
newly
mown
hay
etc
although
because
of
this
i
cant
say
its
anything
special
wow
this
tastes
exactly
like
the
name
makes
it
sound
like
it
would
taste
a
primarily
sweet
and
fruity
tripel
initially
then
followed
by
a
bitter
and
citric
hop
ballast
hop
flavors
also
range
into
grassy
and
medicinal
territory
as
well
medium
body
and
clean
juicy
and
full
mouthfeel
refreshing
in
an
odd
sort
of
way
not
bad
for
the
price
5
99
deposit
and
tax
at
consumers
in
kenmore
definitely
one
to
try
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
very
tall
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
floral
and
slightly
spicy
from
the
hops
interesting
the
flavor
is
full
of
hops
that
taste
like
noble
hops
i
really
dont
care
for
this
type
of
hop
flavoring
but
the
malt
character
is
strong
in
the
back
and
it
lends
a
little
caramel
flavoring
the
body
is
on
the
thick
end
of
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
good
highly
hopped
belgiumthe
second
in
as
many
days
bitterness
is
not
as
drinkable
as
was
the
uthel
hopit
i
e
a
character
of
malted
offsetting
like
a
double
ipa
its
got
musty

that
doesnt
right
hit
the
spot
with
me
ntonethelessmuch
creaminess
and
an
interesting
hop
profile
for
the
hophead
portion
of
me
fresh
from
knightly
spirits
in
orlando
summary
good
beer
but
i
hope
they
up
the
belgian
flavors
in
the
future
so
this
will
neither
emphasize
its
belgianness
nor
its
hops
for
a
hybrid
style
cheers
fabulous
beer
well
worth
getting
experimental
like
and
american
beer
but
belgian
in
character
quality
and
origin
a
great
combination
d
this
is
a
good
slow
drinking
beer
i
think
for
me
i
would
limit
it
to
two
good
and
unique
beer
though
kudos
for
chouffe
for
trying
something
new
and
shaking
up
the
establishment
im
trying
this
in
the
bottle
for
the
first
time
the
head
wasnt
as
nice
as
it
was
on
tap
but
it
was
still
damn
good
body
is
like
pooled
honey
in
my
glass
nose
is
honey
buggle
gum
and
cotton
candy
nose
is
leagues
away
from
what
it
was
on
tap
plus
on
my
first
sip
on
tap
all
i
could
taste
from
the
foam
was
the
hops
here
it
seems
the
flavors
have
meshed
not
that
i
thought
balance
was
a
problem
before
and
really
complement
each
other
props
to
chouffe
youve
made
what
i
imagine
will
influence
many
other
brewers
in
your
country
and
will
make
you
a
legend
this
pours
a
yellow
straw
with
a
giant
white
foamy
head
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
carbonation
the
smell
has
a
strong
hop
and
sugar
aroma
those
two
scents
are
the
most
dominantbut
there
are
also
some
pine
and
citrus
zest
aromas
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
pine
filled
this
beer
has
an
ipa
tastebut
with
a
sour
aftertaste
very
interesting
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
overallthis
is
a
quality
beer
that
should
not
be
missed
the
label
says
9
alcoholbut
you
cant
tell
by
the
taste
mmmm
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
of
fully
carbonated
brew
and
much
like
a
sweet
dessert
with
a
hoppy
pine
that
lingers
on
tap
at
the
gingerman
in
new
york
light
straw
gold
and
hazy
with
a
fluffy
white
head
nose
has
lemon
citrus
a
little
bread
the
flavor
really
reminds
me
of
a
triple
with
a
dump
of
hops
light
citrus
lemon
light
caramel
big
citrus
kick
in
the
middle
a
little
grass
a
lot
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
light
slick

feel
ok
drinkability
i
had
great
hopes
for
this
beer
it
really
is
what
you
would
expect
lachouffe
with
a
healthy
supply
of
hops
if
thats
what
you
want
youll
really
enjoy
it
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
different
power
and
elegance
are
both
on
display
and
with
remarkable
balance
its
not
a
rival
of
ipas
but
it
is
a
hopforward
belgian
beer
in
all
its
glory
i
taste
with
a
clean
pallet
id
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
since
reading
the
article
the
bros
put
out
on
this
beer
ipas
and
tripels
are
some
of
my
favorite
styles
so
what
could
be
better
than
a
marriage
of
the
two
it
poured
a
deep
golden
color
into
my
duvel
tulip
and
had
a
huge
rocky
head
that
took
forever
to
dissipate
it
left
tons
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
an
enticing
mix
of
sweet
malt
spices
and
candi
sugar
the
taste
was
a
wonderful
melding
of
sweetness
citrus
pine
and
peppery
spiciness
the
beer
finishes
quite
dry
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
smooth
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
makes
this
beer
a
good
thirst
quencher
i
could
easily
down
one
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
hophead
expecting
something
along
the
lines
of
an
ipa
might
be
disappointed
though
this
beer
leans
more
towards
its
belgian
roots
and
has
more
of
the
characteristics
of
a
tripel
i
cant
imagine
anyones
first
sip
of
this
being
anything
but
a
pleasing
surprise
its
the
merging
of
two
worlds
yielding
damn
near
the
best
of
each
the
abv
is
hefty
but
the
way
the
beer
dries
and
crisps
its
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
some
beers
suffer
by
trying
to
be
too
many
things
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
instead
it
has
its
own
happy
snappy
identity
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
straw
color
with
an
amazing
billowing
head
that
appears
to
continue
growing
to
a
massive
cap
over
top
clarity
is
moderate
with
a
bit
of
haze
in
there
massive
cascading
bubbles
help
maintain
the
head
this
one
is
going
to
take
a
long
tim
to
get
a
full
glass
poured
nose
is
hindered
a
bit
by
the
foam
i
get
most
notes
of
the
tripel
solid
pilsner
malt
sweetness
with
a
moderate
sugary
sweetness
layered
with
light
lemon
and
banana
creamyness
floral
noble
hops
are
definately
there
and
prevalent
but
seem
to
really
blend
well
with
the
tripel
aromas
i
just
cant
get
the
head
to
receed
enough
to
fill
the
glass
to
the
25
cl
mark
the
head
is
actually
bordering
on
solid
it
is
dense
flavor
is
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
its
got
a
very
nice
sweetness
with
just
a
kiss
of
banana
fruityness
and
lemon
with
a
interesting
combination
of
hop
flavors
that
break
through
after
swallowing
the
beer
the
hops
are
floral
slightly
soapy
and
moderately
bitter
its
tasty
yet
seems
like
the
hops
are
battling
against
the
base
beer
feel
is
moderate
with
a
very
nice
smoothness
about
it
carbonation
is
fairly
minimal
as
it
seems
to
all
have
bubbled
out
maintaining
the
head
overall
drinkability
is
good
on
this
brew
the
abv
is
not
apparent
in
the
nose
of
flavor
i
like
the
mouthfeel
a
lot
i
wonder
if
the
tap
variety
is
as
heady
poured
from
a
1pt
9
oz
bomber
into
a
tulip
first
thing
is
the
absolute
massive
duvelesque
head
that
forms
with
even
the
softest
pour
its
really
quite
beautiful
floating
atop
the
cloudy
peach
body
of
this
brew
and
though
it
does
dissipate
in
time
it
still
leaves
a
huge
dimple
filled
marshmallow
island
and
sporadic
lacing
everywhere
and
for
the
duration
of
the
session
the
smell
is
typically
belgian
pepper
lemon
hay
but
with
some
nice
sweet
citrus
hops
mixed
in
taste
is
just
really
awesome
the
slightly
sweet
candi
sugars
and
belgian
spiciness
mixed
with
the
tangerine
flavored
hops
and
their
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
as
well
creamy
fruity
and
tart
all
in
one
sip
the
marriage
of
the
two
styles
is
complete
when
my
favorite
aspects
of
them
meld
the
aftertaste
the
lingering
ipa
hops
and
tripel
spices
sit
on
the
tongue
and
leave
and
play
off
each
other
long
after
the
brew
itself
leaves
your
mouth
just
an
overall
great
offering
from
a
great
brewery
a
bit
different
and
daring
for
a
belgian
beer
but
i
think
it
was
done
to
great
success
here
well
there
is
alot
of
hype
that
comes
with
this
beer
but
it
was
what
i
expected
really
poured
a
hazy
light
golden
with
a
big
blooming
white
fluffy
headaromas
are
yeasty
somewhat
pneolic
with
herbal
notes
yeah
this
beer
is
pretty
hoppy
the
saaz
really
show
thru
quite
spicey
and
zippy
with
green
herbal
notes
and
somewhat
medicinal
the
belgian
yeast
is
very
prevelant
along
with
a
minerallike
qualityeh
its
ok
but
to
me
along
the
same
lines
of
urthel
hop
it
in
its
hop
character
just
not
my
thing
i
guess
but
a
solid
beer
none
the
less
this
is
easily
the
hoppiest
belgian
beer
ive
had
quite
the
unique
concoction
as
someone
else
pointed
out
its
like
if
you
took
la
chouffe
which
i
really
like
and
dumped
a
bunch
of
hops
in
thats
about
what
they
ended
up
with
here
pours
a
huge
lasting
foamy
head
almost
reminiscent
of
duvel
take
your
time
pouring
tangy
taste
dry
bitter
finish
packs
a
whollup
which
seems
bigger
than
the
9
abv
would
suggest
if
youre
a
tripel
fan
andor
an
american
double
ipa
fan
grab
this
up
quite
a
marriage
thanks
ron
the
mouth
is
alive
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
hop
dryness
that
help
clear
the
palate
save
for
some
lingering
hop
flavors
this
is
a
great
beer
i
will
buy
more
in
the
morning
before
work
ill
make
sure
to
keep
it
in
my
truck
in
the
parking
structure
down
the
street
but
who
knows
those
gnomes
have
a
history
of
causing
mischief
opaque
medium
yellow
color
with
a
dullish
brightness
good
head
rocky
and
rising
to
over
12
an
inch
laces
in
dripping
rings
nice
aroma
medium
malt
base
with
a
slight
sharpness
and
a
definite
amarillo
orange
cream
backbone
carbonation
is
high
but
still
the
mouthfeel
comes
off
as
medium
with
a
solidly
textured
impression
flavor
starts
with
a
pointed
tanginess
bittering
hops
seem
to
reinforce
the
aroma
in
a
onetwo
effort
nevertheless
by
mid
mouth
there
is
a
distinct
husky
and
slightly
oily
sweetened
apricot
tone
partly
maltderived
from
residual
sugars
and
perhaps
owing
to
the
the
finishing
mix
of
aroma
hops
a
pretty
big
mix
of
characteristics
perhaps
there
could
be
a
more
seamless
blend
of
the
dominant
qualities
really
good
ill
happily
try
it
again
if
someone
else
buys
it
otherwise
ill
be
careful
because
brasserie
dachouffe
keeps
bottling
the
750s
in
green
bottles
this
might
be
too
fresh
or
too
hopped
to
be
skunked
but
over
time
you
never
know
as
for
drinkability
this
was
offthechart
for
me
the
bottle
was
emptying
at
an
alarming
rate
until
i
reined
my
tastebuds
in
the
brewers
at
dachouffe
have
produced
a
sublime
brew
that
on
the
surface
doesnt
seem
to
possibly
work
however
the
elements
coexist
beautifully
and
make
for
a
standout
hybrid
i
wish
id
had
more
room
in
my
backpack
for
this
liquid
gold
not
as
hoppy
as
you
would
expect
my
wife
doesnt
like
belgians
but
loved
this
go
figure
basically
tastes
like
la
chouffe
kicked
up
a
bit
in
the
hop
bitterness
a
very
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinish
finishes
dry
very
refreshing
though
with
its
spiciness
and
crispness
from
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
superb
ill
really
struggled
not
getting
another
glass
of
this
tonight
hopefully
i
can
get
a
couple
bottles
to
enjoy
this
at
home
good
stuff
definately
worth
seeking
out
or
making
a
special
trip
drinkability
easy
drinking
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
could
sneek
up
on
you
this
is
a
unique
beer
and
it
grew
on
me
during
the
session
im
looking
forward
to
having
a
few
more
of
these
in
the
near
future
all
ipa
fans
must
seek
this
out
d
i
need
more
of
this
nectar
i
bought
4
bottles
i
hope
that
this
stunner
is
widely
available
all
year
round
go
get
some
and
enjoy
d
theres
nothing
here
that
you
wouldnt
expect
to
find
in
either
a
tripel
or
a
dipa
but
to
maintain
the
characteristics
of
both
of
these
styles
and
make
a
beer
this
good
truly
shows
the
artistry
of
the
brewers
drinkability
very
highly
drinkable
like
i
said
earlier
the
alcohol
content
goes
almost
unoticed
pretty
amazing
i
could
have
had
more
than
one
bottle
which
is
rare
for
me
being
im
a
bit
of
a
light
weight
with
bigger
beers
m
d
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
extremely
high
carbonation
is
pretty
big
but
still
doesnt
take
away
from
the
wonderful
flavor
high
abv
is
pretty
noticeable
as
it
burns
when
you
sniff
otherwise
its
kind
of
hidden
in
the
taste
definately
drinkable
but
only
one
a
good
and
different
tasting
brew
body
is
very
big
on
this
one
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slick
leaving
your
lips
hoppy
and
sticky
with
each
sip
i
bet
this
would
age
wonderfully
although
the
mighty
hop
character
would
lose
some
of
its
luster
hoppy
fruity
full
wonderfully
complex
and
different
i
love
it
go
buy
lots
right
now
overall
a
unique
blend
but
1
i
wasnt
too
crazy
about
the
strong
alcohol
almost
ruins
the
beer
i
have
been
anticipating
this
beer
since
i
saw
it
on
the
importers
website
i
love
both
the
other
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
it
pours
with
a
bright
straw
color
and
really
nice
head
into
my
16
oz
goblet
has
tons
of
bubbles
in
the
head
lots
of
aroma
mostly
sweet
malt
typical
of
a
triple
but
with
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
leans
toward
the
sazz
taste
is
truly
unique
different
from
other
hoppy
belgian
beers
i
have
tried
not
as
hoppy
as
the
deranke
xx
bitter
and
not
as
biscuit
as
la
rulles
triple
leaves
a
tingly
sensation
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
almost
like
licking
a
9
volt
battery
i
am
only
half
way
through
the
bottle
so
maybe
when
it
warms
up
a
little
the
flavors
will
become
more
distinctive
overall
i
would
say
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
would
really
like
a
chance
to
have
it
on
tap
starts
sweet
but
balanced
with
a
cleansing
bitter
floral
hop
finish
starts
like
a
belgian
blonde
and
finishes
like
an
american
ipa
nice
blend
of
flavors
to
make
a
balanced
drinkable
beer
overall
impression
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
not
as
offensive
as
a
classic
tripel
which
i
dont
usually
like
and
not
as
bold
as
any
american
ipa
i
dig
the
experimentation
a
nice
blend
of
both
styles
recommended
notes
much
hoppier
than
urthels
hopit
too
much
bitterness
not
enough
hoppiness
sweetness
good
experience
and
enjoyable

at
greenlife
in
asheville
nc
this
is
a
very
very
nice
beer
it
has
a
nice
hop
bite
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
taste
has
the
typical
belgian
fruity
yeastiness
and
in
this
case
i
get
a
bit
of
figs
and
prunes
what
sets
this
beer
apart
is
its
absurd
drinkablity
the
hop
finish
is
very
dry
as
if
the
only
thing
that
can
soothe
the
toungue
is
another
sip
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
would
if
it
were
a
bit
cheaper
coming
into
this
brew
blind
i
feel
like
i
had
a
unique
take
on
it
rarely
do
i
enjoy
a
beer
without
knowing
what
it
is
and
this
one
impressed
me
no
matter
what
the
style
i
was
definitely
confused
because
it
wasnt
exactly
spicy
like
coriander
but
it
wasnt
entirely
unlike
it
either
i
looked
like
a
witbier
and
smelled
like
it
too
so
i
just
assumed
it
was
another
crazy
beer
from
the
gnome
of
belgium
indeed
it
was
but
a
stronger
animal
than
i
expected
respect
the
gnome
because
i
felt
the
effects
of
sucking
this
bad
boy
down
very
good
i
loved
it
id
like
to
try
a
bottle
for
comparison
word
on
the
streets
that
its
not
quite
the
same
ive
been
anticipating
this
beer
for
a
bit
now
its
just
about
what
i
expected
the
hops
arent
perfectly
integrated
with
the
malt
but
its
a
good
effort
especially
in
a
style
that
most
belgian
brewers
arent
accustomed
to
making
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
brew
evolves
over
different
batches
but
even
now
its
pretty
damn
good
interesting
take
hope
this
is
more
of
a
oneoff
if
not
no
worries
ill
stick
with
the
original
though
messing
with
nearperfection
is
not
the
way
to
chouffe
enlightenment
although
it
is
a
nice
change
from
the
classic
norm
turbid
and
straw
yellow
with
a
sizable
white
foamy
head
quick
streams
of
carbonation
reinforce
familiar
chouffe
yeasty
nose
accented
by
large
this
is
belgian
you
know
doses
of
citrus
grass
and
candysweet
malt
nicely
balanced
hop
flavor
and
esters
sweet
malt
finish
hardly
a
hint
of
the
9
abv
bitterness
is
big
nice
and
big
perhaps
a
bit
out
of
whack
on
second
taste
hop
flavor
seems
second
compared
to
the
mildly
raw
bitterness
very
good
beer
in
a
bottle
even
better
draft
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
is
like
a
batch
or
two
once
they
nail
what
theyre
looking
for
worth
seeking
out
like
de
ranke
the
beer
was
hoppy
but
not
ipa
hoppy
there
was
a
lot
of
body
in
this
to
balance
the
somewhat
high
hop
levels
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
solid
triple
sampled
at
zbf
4306
nice
and
forever
lasting
white
head
and
a
witbier
like
pale
golden
beer
nose
is
nice
and
hoppy
anis
malts
and
backed
with
high
alcohol
damps
taste
is
rich
malty
bit
sweet
but
balanced
with
high
but
peaking
and
not
hanging
bitterness
and
warming
alcohol
great
brew
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
making
wanting
for
more
poured
a
lively
orangey
amber
a
big
foamy
white
head
takes
a
minute
to
settle
down
and
leaves
sticky
lacing
as
it
does
the
aroma
is
mild
with
just
light
hints
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
yeast
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
spice
but
not
much
funk
its
kind
of
bland
as
it
goes
along
the
mouthfeel
is
adequate
with
a
just
little
spicy
bite
it
cant
seem
to
decide
if
its
an
ipa
with
a
belgian
twist
or
a
belgian
wit
with
an
ipa
twist
in
the
end
its
muddled
and
not
really
either
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
belgian
ipa
but
certainly
enjoyable
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
saison
or
a
farmhouse
ale
im
reviewing
this
beer
but
still
not
quite
certain
about
the
style
or
my
affection
for
it
the
ale
pours
a
hazy
golden
copper
with
a
very
thick
white
head
that
is
quite
long
lasting
and
leaves
a
slight
white
lacing
behind
the
aroma
is
sour
and
earthy
with
notes
of
orange
bitters
grass
and
herbaciousness
it
sips
smooth
with
a
light
to
medium
body
the
flavor
is
quite
tangy
slightly
sour
and
has
a
slight
bite
of
alcohol
it
is
pleasing
on
the
palate
and
invigorating
on
the
brain
with
questions
of
what
all
is
happening
in
this
ale
ive
enjoyed
te
differences
in
this
ale
from
what
i
am
used
to
but
still
not
sure
if
it
is
a
beer
style
that
i
will
return
to
often
that
being
said
i
can
say
that
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
ale
which
at
the
very
reason
price
should
most
certainly
be
picked
up
and
tried
even
if
the
style
is
not
completely
your
cup
of
tea
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
ale
with
some
complexity
and
a
superb
integration
of
malt
yeast
and
hop
flavors
recommended
farmhouse
hatter
makes
great
use
of
saison
and
abbaye
yeast
as
well
as
american
hops
combining
them
all
with
rich
malt
to
create
a
super
agreeable
beer
that
is
layered
and
hearty
yet
super
approachable
and
ideal
for
casual
drinking
new
holland
arent
in
the
habit
of
making
crappy
beers
definitely
give
this
one
a
go
youd
be
mad
not
to
i
saw
this
sitting
for
the
past
few
years
on
shelves
and
never
bothered
picking
it
up
its
been
hit
or
miss
with
new

beers
but
it
seems
like
the
price
was
just
right
for
my
thirst
picked
up
this

bottle
and
i
am
very
glad
i
did
so

good
stuff
good
price
tag
a
very
tasty
farmhouse
belgian
from
new
holland
im
ready
for
another
the
farmhouse
hatter
has
a
definite
rustic
edge
and
a
mild
funk
to
it
which
is
welcome
in
this
day
and
age
of
massproduced
playitsafe
saisons
overall
glad
i
could
give
this
one
a
go
could
be
a
little
better
fresher
and
on
tap
but
still
tasty
nonetheless
good
for
those
who
like
things
a
little
funky
only
drawback
is
low
alcohol
content
otherwise
top
draw
stuff
very
nice
beer
the
nose
is
a
bit
subdued
for
the
style
but
it
has
plenty
of
complexity
and
a
decent
hop
bite
o
i
like
this
beer
and
especially
enjoy
the
prominent
yeast
though
the
finish
is
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
the
5
abv
makes
it
pretty
easy
drinking
and
the
lemon
and
grasspine
notes
are
enjoyable
still
it
doesnt
establish
itself
as
a
real
competitor
to
other
heavy
hitter
belgian
ipas
it
would
pair
well
with
savory
and
rich
soups
or
stews
where
the
lemon
and
hops
could
provide
good
contrast
this
beer
was
a
surprise
from
my
girlfriend
and
certainly
enjoyable
o
an
enjoyable
beer
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
at
a

being
very
happy

very

overall
with
some

and
a
good
feel
this
beer
pours
hazy
orange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
beer
has
a
lightly
hopped
nose
and
the
belgian
yeast
really
comes
through
this
beer
has
a
moderate
bitterness
and
a
very
piney
citrusy
hop
profile
that
is
on
par
with
the
other
hatters
the
belgian
yeast
really
gives
this
beer
a
unique
spiciness
there
is
flavors
of
clove
and
wheat
but
a
spicy
note
only
the
yeast
could
add
it
has
a
good
deal
of
feel
for
a
beer
this
size
and
its
not
super
quick
to
drink
but
makes
for
a
nice
paced
beer
overall
its
not
my
favorite
of
the
hatter
line
up
but
its
a
pretty
decent

ipa
drink
i
liked
this
one
a

more
than
the
oak
really
hoping
the
rye
will
be
better
mouth
feel
is
pretty
good
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
there
is
some
tough
competition
the
body
is
medium
moderately
carbonated
with
a
brisk
consistent
crispness
its
smooth
enough
to
keep
the
flow
moving
even
creamy

point

the
bonedry

oan
interesting
belgian

with
a
unusual

overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
its
a

the
belgian
and
the
ipa
side
middle
of
the
road
for
me
3
0
overall
3
5
to
me
this
beer
is
like
a
classic
saison
done
relatively
well
with
a
ton
of
bittering
hops
thrown
in
its
not
fantastic
as
a
belgian
style
and
the
ipa
side
of
it
could
use
a
little
more
malt
depth
grain
richness
some
solid
dryhopping
and
more
flavoring
hops
in
my
opinion
this
would
pop
with
a
richer
grain
body
and
some
serious
tropical
hop
flavor
its
pretty
good
for
sure
but
not
excellent
in
any
way
outside
of
the
appearance
which
is
damn
good
and
the
smell
not
quite
as
good
but
very
good
in
its
own
right
o
looks
and
smells
nice
and
i
like
the
tartness
but
the
hops
were
way
too
weak
in
the
taste
a
nice
americantwisted
belgian
ipa
very
drinkable
indeed
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
interesting
take
on
the
ipa
it
struck
me
as
a
good
american
ipa
that
just
happened
to
be
fermented
with
belgian
farmhouse
yeast
criticism
the
overall
beer
was
a
bit
thin
in
both
flavor
and
abv
while
a
fun
and
intricate
little
brew
they
could
have
amped
it
up
a
couple
notches
recommended
if
your
a
fan
of
the
style
or
are
looking
for
a
cheap
and
different
bomber
for
the
night
cheers
its
a
flavorful
brew
that
you
should
not
refuse
dont
expect
a
big
beer
because
it
is
understated
the
alcohol
is
pretty
low
for
anything
that
says
ipa
on
the
label
t
he
aroma
is
first
rate
and
almost
a
redemming
quality
do
while
yeast
qualities
are
true
to
the
farmhouse
label
this
beers
hop
flavors
unfortunately
distract
and
bore
the
palate
columbus
cultivar
qualities
stand
out
going
from
simple
pine
passing
through
dilute
chemical
plastic
and
finishing
with
harsh
unmodified
bitterness
as
a
straight
saison
or
even
with
a
more
judicious
handling
of
the
hops
this
ale
could
have
been
much
more
enjoyable
d
far
more
a
saison
than
a
belgian
style
ipa
or
pale
earthy
funky
a
bit
tart
rather
than
fruity
and
phenolic
and
hoppy
hops
while
substantial
are
not
in
ipa
territory
marketing
names
and
pigeon
hole
aside
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
a
fine
saison
too
very
tasty
the
drinking
leand
more
to
intereting
than
to
easy
and
quite
refreshing
too
o
a
decent
beer
with
an
easy
drinkability
belgian
qualities
are
present
but
are
not
overpowering
taking
the
farmhouse
ale
to
another
level
with
the
hopping

it

from

ipa

everywhere
once
it

you
have
a

with
still
massive

there
is
some
serious
farmhouse
funk
coming
off
this
thing
yeast

more

the
flavors
are
a

yeast
lots
of
light
hay
dry
some
grassy
hops
a
little
spice
pretty
good
not
great
this
is
quite
a
bit
more
enjoyable
than
i
was
expecting
the
mix
of
vibrant
hop
character
and
spicy
earthy
yeast
character
works
quite
well
overall
this
beer
is
alright
but
i
would
have
liked
more
hops
and
more
of
a
belgian
presence
kind
of
boring
but
not
bad
o
hv
found
at
cardinal
liqs
niles
il
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
and
dry
has
a
bit
of
a
peppery
aftertaste
well
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
however
i
dont
think
the
nose
or
flavor
profile
was
where
nhs
description
lead
me
to
believe
had
the
hop
profile
been
more
present
in
the
nose
and
the
belgian
notes
more
present
in
the
flavor
i
wouldve
enjoyed
this
even
more
this
is
like
a
saison
with
the
malt
drained
out
something
about
this
tastes
incomplete
and
used
up
the
belgian
character
is
there
with
a
touch
of
yeastiness
but
the
bacteria
seems
to
be
eating
whatever
malt
was
left
austerity
in
a
bottle
o
not
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
but
not
bad
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
earthiness
to
this
one
o
i
was
left
wanting
a
little
more
from
this
beer
but
was
left
a
little
empty
i
would
put
this
more
into
the
belgian
pale
category
than
the
belgian
ipa
this
still
was
a
decent
a
respectable
beer
o
nice
dry
belgian
ipa
light
and
wild
the
mouthfeel
is
very
bubbly
somewhat
dry
and
finishes
on
the
metallic
side
o
not
as
good
as
the
other
belgian
ipas
ive
had
its
decent
and
definitely
drinkable
and
refreshing
at
only

im
surprised
i
get
any
alcohol
in
the
taste
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
yellow
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
green
apples
small
earth
and
a
small
hp
in
the
taste
yeasty
earthy
and
ends
with
a
green
apple
fruitiness
a
small
sour
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
yeasty
green
apple
in
the
aftertaste
nice
tart
great
saison
qualities
i
can
dig
it
o
kind
of
funky
for
a
belgian
ipa
but
a
lot
going
on
and
some
nice
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
in
body
there
was
a
mouthfilling
fluffy
carbonation
nicer
than
i
had
expected
o
the
hops
are
nice
and
big
but
the
peppery
yeast
character
is
a
bit
to
bitter
and
hides
some
of
the
hop
depth
the
pepper
and
hop
bitterness
make
it
a
bit
to
harsh
in
the
finish
it
really
does
come
across
as
an
odd
hybrid
between
a
lighter
more
subtle
saison
and
an
ipa
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
saison
elements
sometimes
arent
strong
enough
to
shine
through
the
overlapping
ipa
citric
oil
if
only
there
was
more
funk
i
never
found
any
horse
blanket
funk
in
this
brew
only
a
faint
tartness
which
is
why
i
called
the
saison
subtle
maybe
about
20
more
raunchiness
would
have
worked
better
for
my
tastes
d
drinks
quite
nicely
ill
have
to
keep
this
one
as
of
my
regulars
it
tastes
like
i
imagined
it
would
a
cross
between
a
belgian
ipa
and
a
saison
and
a
harmonious
one
at
that
i
highly
recommend
it
o
i
was
excited
by
what
i
smelled
but
this
just
doesnt
come
together

the

now
for

taste
it
is
bold
with

you
pick
up
on
some

this
is
a
nice
drinking
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
but
clean
and
relishing
overall
im
giving

a
4
out

i
would
buy
this
brew
again
new
holland
brewing
company
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
there
is
also
some
things
floating
in
this
brew
but
it
a
nice
drinking
brew
floral
hoppy
aroma
and
flavor
great
with
spicy
food
but
to
hoppy
by
itself
for
my
taste
on

one
of
the
best
of
this
style
i
have
had
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
way
under
rated
on
this
site
great
tasting
beer
with
great
body
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
has
won
several
awards
for
good
reason
great
job
new
holland
overall
pretty
tasty
better
than
i
expected
to
much
sediment
in
this
big
turn
off
then
the
flavors
just
did
not
mesh
at
all
i
would
pass
on
this
one
overall
a
decent
belgian
ipa
not
bad
overall
but
nothing
super
exceptional
overall
definitely
an
interesting
combination
i
think
if
the
wheat
flavour
had
been
toned
down
and
the
hops
bumped
up
this
would
have
been
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
as
it
is
it
is
only
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
though
ill
drink
it
and
be
happy
heres
the
best
i
can
do
this
is
distinctly
indistinct
but
not
in
a
bad
way
i
said
it
hope
that
helps
tasty
and
more
malt
than
any
belgian
white
but
this
is
a
belgian
style
pale
ale
so
maybe
i
shouldnt
compare
refreshing
citrusy
a
bit
of
orange
and
grapefruit
yums
tasty
yum
yum
yum
drink
this
all
day
hey
hey
new
holland
makes
some
good
beers
this
is
not
one
of
them
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
snifter
not
a
nice
looking
beer
definitely
unfiltered
light
amber
with
very
little
head
great
carb
bubbles
though
looked
kind
of
like
grapefruit
juice
some
nice
floral
notes
on
the
nose
also
a
bit
of
orange
and
ironically
grapefruit
taste
was
v
nice
interesting
yeasty
and
crisp
malty
notes
bit
of
biscuit
strong
citrus
punch
much
better
than
the
aroma
dictated
rather
light
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
aftertaste
wasnt
super
excited
to
try
his
one
but
there
were
some
nice
surprises
anyways
unique
and
worth
a
go
o
i
appreciate
the
grains
of
paradise
and
the
more
tropical
notes
for
a
belgian
that
made
it
very
interesting
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
any
bite
made
it
pretty
mediocre
overall
a
nice
and
flavorful
citrusy
wit
the
bitterness
is
not
as
pronounced
here
as
it
has
been
in
other
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
this
is
a
beer
i
would
reach
for
if
i
wanted
this
style
i
agitated
the
beer
prior
to
my
usual
aggro
pour
and
as
such
i
stirred
things
up
real
good
it
came
rushing
out
filling
the
glass
with
a
pseudocascade
and
producing
two
fingers
of
mountainous
fluffy
bonewhite
head
that
slowly
fell
leaving
great
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
very
cloudy
orangishyellow
srm

nose
had
a
musty
citrusiness
kind
of
lemony
but
also
very
dry
and
dusty
like
newspapers
in
an
attic
mouthfeel
was
soft
caressing
my
poor
bruised
tongue
like
an
old
friend
this
was
like
hops
tea
it
was
really
mellow
with
loads
of
flavor
like
lemon
zest
mango
peach
pear
garden
flowers
and
some
black
pepper
i
felt
like
i
was
being
lulled
into
a
nap
the
finish
was
quite
dry
thanks
to
the
spices
but
on
a
hot
humid
afternoon
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
new
holland
beer
on
here
had
this
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
pale
golden
color
clearer
than
i
would
have
expected
subtle
malt
and
spice
flavors
neither
of
which
were
as
strong
as
i
expected
not
a
lot
of
the
flavors
youd
expect
to
get
from
a
wheat
come
through
soft
mouthfeel
didnt
have
a
ton
of
head
on
this
one
it
was
decent
just
a
little
hohum
final
word
sorry
folks
but
i
dont
recommend
this
one
im
always
reluctant
to
tell
people
not
to
try
a
beer
but
this
one
just
felt
like
new
holland
needs
a
bit
more
time
to
perfect
it
the
hop
and
wheat
flavors
countered
each
other
very
well
but
the
sticking
point
with
this
beer
was
the
bubblegum
fluoride
aroma
and
flavor
some
wheat
beers
have
a
bit
of
a
bubblegum
flavor
in
them
but
the
degree
to
which
its
present
in
this
beer
is
completely
out
of
balance
with
the
other
ingredients
it
doesnt
complement
nor
mesh
with
the
other
flavors
and
doesnt
seem
to
have
a
place
in
the
brew
i
dont
feel
like
this
is
a
problem
inherent
to
the
fact
that
its
a
belgian
style
white
pale
ale
but
instead
that
its
a
sub
par
batch
or
a
recipe
that
needs
perfection
if
youre
the
type
that
wants
to
try
something
new
id
wait
a
year
or
two
and
see
if
this
brew
is
still
around
as
by
then
id
say
theyll
have
worked
out
the
kinks
or
you
have
a
chance
of
getting
a
better
batch
than
i
did
but
otherwise
id
choose
many
other
wheaty
beers
over
this
one
if
i
wanted
that
fix
but
hey
if
you
love
bubblegum
fluoride
have
at
it
this
offering
makes
for
a
nice
smooth
session
beer
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
here
mouthfeel
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
flavor
and
great
body
i
am
quite
surprised
to
see
this
beer
rather
so
low
on
here
i
find
it
delightful
and
different
from
the
rest
the
belgian
yeast
isnt
nearly
so
ester
laden
not
so
fruity
and
dominating
its
just
drying
and
complimentary
to
everything
else
going
on
wheat
base
is
a
little
darker
than
most
with
a
bronze
hue
to
it
and
a
nose
propelled
primarily
by
the
orange
seems
like
more
than
just
orange
peel
but
flesh
too
especially
in
the
flavor
like
it
was
just
fresh
squeezed
right
in
the
chamomile
is
subtle
in
this
but
adds
another
layer
thats
accentuated
by
the
yeast
more
green
tea
bitterness
than
anything
else
herbal
fun
bright
its
hopped
more
like
an
american
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
to
me
not
subtle
but
not
huge
and
oily
and
bitter
either
its
in
the
middle
somewhere
with
hops
that
balance
and
add
backbone
to
the
citrus
of
the
orange
the
finish
is
clean
and
light
and
thats
where
i
taste
the
belgian
yeast
the
most
great
carbonation
thicker
body
for
the
style
too
which
makes
it
rather
satisfying
a
very
cool
take
on
the
style
and
i
think
this
beer
deserves
a
little
more
credit
than
it
currently
has
not
the
best
white
ipa
out
there
but
one
of
the
more
interesting
ive
had
lately
o
a
near
incredible
belgian
ipa
that
judging
from
previous
reviews
does
not
get
the
credit
it
deserves
really
well
executed
with
an
exceptional
malt
body
and
unique
hopping
i
love
the
combination
of
brewers
gold
glacier
motueka
and
crystal
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
not
my
favorite
but
an
awesome
summer
time
brew
im
happy
to
drink
any
time
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
wheat
beer
good
mix
of
spices
and
fruit
esters
with
a
nice
hop
kick
o
i
see
what
theyre
trying
to
do
here
a
wpa
blending
a
belgian
wit
and
an
ipa
seems
more
like
a
belgian
pale
to
me
no
ipa
characteristics
at
all
the
orange
peel
overwhelms
the
hop
character
im
not
quite
sure
what
the
reason
was
to
brew
this
beer
as
it
warmed
up
still
no
flavor
or
aroma
just
developed
a
more
lively
carbonation
for
me
this
beer
has
to
be
described
in
null
terms
it
was
cellared
by
a
sixpack
store
in
erie
under
low
light
conditions
at
about
29
degrees
c
at
least
it
was
not
offensive
kind
of
like
drinking
a
weak
sparkling
water
perhaps
i
should
have
been
more
careful
about
sediment
but
it
is
still
an
interesting
brew
overall
i
applaud
this
beer
for
being
highly
unique
the
interesting
combination
of
flavors
and
smells
along
with
that
distinctive
mouthfeel
make
for
a
very
memorable
experience
it
is
listed
here
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
which
it
is
not
but
i
honestly
dont
know
what
else
to
call
it
im
guessing
thats
what
the
brewers
had
in
mind
i
wish
that
my
bottle
had
been
a
little
fresher
as
i
would
really
like
to
like
it
more
ive
tried
to
neutralize
the
aging
flaws

with
a
thin
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
as
you
drink
smell
of
slight
lemon
grass
and
wheat
citrus
hop
aroma
fallows
taste
of
slight
malty
wheat
and
lemon
peel
the
hops
have
a
very
piney
quality
at
the
end
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
summer
months
a
fairly
overlooked
brew
with
a
unique
quality
although
this
wasnt
strong
it
felt
a
bit
more
potent
than
it
was
in
actuality
this
was
pretty
unique
but
only
because
ive
never
had
a
belgian
ipa
that
was
supposedly
brewed
like
this
the
bottle
says
that
there
were
notes
of
coriander
and
grains
of
paradise
here
along
the
lines
of
a
sam
adams
summer
offering
while
they
could
be
detected
to
some
extent
the
citrus
bite
faded
quickly
after
the
initial
kick
had
they
endured
longer
it
would
have
rounded
out
this
beer
nicely
and
complemented
the
belgian
aspects
of
this
take
it
for
what
it
is
its
a
fun
style
that
served
as
a
steppingstone
for
what
else
is
possible
and
still
went
down
relatively
easily
very
similar
to
new
hollands
monkey
king
initial
sweetness
fades
quickly
to
spicy
yeast
flavors
and
earthy
and
herbal
hop
flavor
the
bitterness
tends
to
mask
some
of
the
belgian
flavors
besides
a
lot
of
spicy
yeast
flavor
very
herbal
some
faint
fruit
underneath
it
all
almost
apple
like
bitterness
lingers
with
an
apple
like
sweetness
lingering
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
medium
bodied
with
prickly
mouthfeel
beer
gets
a
bit
better
as
it
warms
as
your
tongue
grows
accustomed
to
the
bitterness
as
well
lets
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
come
through
and
shows
off
the
complexity
of
the
beer
flavors
are
a
little
muddled
and
some
greatly
overpower
others
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
slightly
dry
finish
pours
into
a
tall
prima
pils
glass
with
a
turbid
glowing
orange
amber
hue
with
a
bright
light
off
white
head
forming
thick
you
can
see
proteins
and
yeast
sediment
suspended
in
the
body
aroma
is
full
of
citrus
spice
and
orange
peel
notes
a
nice
bready
yeastmalt
combo
going
on
almost
like
a
sam
adams
summer
ale
i
also
notice
grains
of
paradise
on
the
ingredients
listed
on
the
bottle
flavors
are
really
combined
into
a
spice
mix
pack
with
a
mediocre
ipa
with
citrus
forward
hops
very
dry
presentation
the
bitterness
comes
from
the
spices
orange
peel
and
hop
additions
somewhere
in
the
mad
mix
of
adjuncts
you
have
a
drinkable
beer
medium
bodied
spritzy
carbonation
dry
bitter
finish
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
much
better
than
some
of
the
other
white
ipas
i
have
tangoed
with
o
ok
beer
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
had
but
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
it
seemed
like
they
didnt
commit
to
which
of
the
two
characteristics
they
want
to
feature
it
wasnt
very
ipa
like
nor
belgian
like
sort
of
a
bland
mashup
of
the
two
easy
drinking
and
not
a
bad
beer
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
o
a
distinct
and
unusual
flowery
pa
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
as
expected
that
dissipates
quickly
orange
coriander
and
chamomile
in
the
aroma
light
crisp
and
very
refreshing
mostly
citrus
fruit
flavor
but
piney
hops
come
in
at
the
end
especially
noticeable
in
the
bitter
finish
this
is
a
sacchariferous
and
subtle
beer
with
balance
from
the
hops
to
keep
it
from
getting
cloying
clocks
in
at
just
5
5
abv
so
several
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
night
would
do
quite
well
overall
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
with
enough
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
but
not
overwhelming
pours
a
hazed
whiteyellow
with
a
white
sizzling
crackling
head
that
forms
a
pillowy
foam
laces
the
glass
expertly
and
looks
like
a
good
looking
witbier
smell
of
citrus
herbs
lemongrass
bread
in
the
taste
some
lemony
citrus
green
banana
coriander
orange
peel
and
pine
all
join
together
strongly
bitter
which
works
well
with
the
citrus
peel
and
lemony
wheat
notes
medium
bodied
feel
well
carbonated
and
finishes
with
citrus
and
hop
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
sometime
as
white
hatter
makes
for
a
refreshing
drink
poured
into
a
small
tulip
glass
a
slightly
orange
tinged
lemony
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
left
a
few
broken
chunks
of
lace
as
it
settled
pretty
quickly
spiced
phenols
and
tropical
citrusy
fruits
really
stand
out
in
the
nose
over
top
of
toasted
grain
very
citrusy
on
the
palatei
mean
the
citrus
really
jumps
out
at
yamild
phenols
and
again
toasted
grain
underneath
not
bad
with
its
big
citrusy
flavors
but
not
real
overly
complex
a
bpa
thats
a
stretch
ill
say
it
was
fun
i
havent
had
anything
that
ive
truly
really
enjoyed
from
new
holland
and
white
hatter
is
no
different
its
a
decent
beer
but
its
not
all
that
interesting
or
memorable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
a
nice
combination
of
both
styles
that
was
kept
very
balanced
which
worked
out
nicely
and
i
thought
the
hops
complemented
the
base
beer
nicely
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
refreshing
and
the
flavors
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
summer
day
the
taste
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
both
styles
were
represented
nicely
they
worked
well
together
and
seemed
to
complement
each
other
there
wasnt
anything
that
i
disliked
about
this
beer
it
was
fine
just
the
way
it
was
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
thought
it
was
good
and
priced
nicely
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
just
about
anyone
all
in
all
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
and
it
turned
out
better
than
i
expected
and
i
like
it
much
more
than
mad
hatter
this
was
another
good
beer
from
new
holland
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
coarse
soapy
white
head
good
lacing
on
the
glass
very
yeasty
nose
the
flavor
profile
doesnt
really
work
yeasty
funk
overwhelms
and
doesnt
allow
the
more
nuanced
flavors
and
spices
typical
of
a
wheat
beer
to
shine
through
not
terrible
but
it
clearly
misses
the
mark
wont
be
getting
this
again
not
a
bad
beer
with
a
desent
depth
of
flavor
o
would
definitely
recommend
if
you
like
mad
hatter
you
will
enjoy
white
hatter
really
hits
the
spot
if
you
want
some
hops
in
your
life
but
arnt
feeling
the
bitterness
of
an
ipa
o
good
american
made
bpa
o
nothing
overly
special
here
although
i
am
sure
it
could
be
used
to
great
effect
in
getting
blue
moon
fans
to
venture
out
into
the
beer
world
this
is
a
pretty
nice
well
balanced
drinkable
white
ipa
it
has
a
nice
herbal
hop
character
as
well
as
an
enjoyable
citrus
note
the
nose
was
tremendous
overall
very
enjoyable
its
definitely
worth
a
try
though
it
wont
appease
those
looking
for
something
dominantly
hoppy
or
dominantly
belgiany
decent
bpa
not
bad
but
nothing
special
this
would
be
nice
for
springsummerwarm
weather
overall
its
a
hopped
up
overly
spiced
witbier
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
almost
translucent
orange
lots
of
visible
carbonation
and
a
small
amount
of
white
head
that
disperses
quickly
smell
is
very
potent
out
of
the
bottle
dominated
by
coriander
and
citrus
but
it
fades
almost
as
soon
as
it
is
poured
into
the
glass
taste
is
similar
some
coriander
some
orange
and
lemon
flavors
and
a
lingering
bitterness
that
is
probably
the
hops
and
maybe
the
chamomile
flavors
mentioned
on
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
with
heavy
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
belgian
white
o
easy
drinking
belgian
pale
nothing
extreme
but
enjoyable
on
a
warm
day
overall
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
a
pretty
typical
new
holland
brew
nothing
mind
blowing
nothing
awful
nothing
shocking
ect
o
a
great
beer
for
a
summers
eve
more
complex
than
hoegaarden
and
blue
moon
not
too
overwhelming
nice
fruitful
light
beer
to
me
this
seems
to
lean
into
belgian
ipa
territory
the
back
label
basically
states
as
much
and
there
are
definitely
hop
tones
going
on
here
somewhat
earthy
with
spice
tones
on
there
and
the
typical
belgian
characteristics
it
works
for
me
and
i
like
it
o
this
beer
starts
of
pretty
tasty
but
it
falls
off
quickly
to
a
harsh
odd
hop
flavor
and
the
yeast
character
disappears
as
well
an
interesting
take
on
the
belgian
pa
from
new
holland
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
overall
disappointing
on
two
fronts
firstly
my
brother
who
got
me
a
few
hatters
said
it
was
his
favorite
secondly
compared
to
the
farm
house
hatter
consumed
the
previous
night
it
was
a
let
down
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
yes
meh
its
a
pretty
average
beer
that
doesnt
offer
much
o
enjoyable
and
mildly
memorable
would
order
another
only
possibly
will
buy
again
i
think
a
white
ipa
would
be
less
funky
and
more
hoppy
and
coriandery
overall
an
easy
drinking
white
ipa
and
i
liked
it
3
0
d
decent
beer
but
i
was
looking
forward
to
drinking
a
wit
oh
well
i
know
now
give
it
a
try
disappointing
ive
enjoyed
the
hatters
over
the
years
this
one
is
by
far
the
weakest
of
the
bunch
not
bad
by
any
measure
just
kind
of
there
there
hatter
present
hatter
mediocre
hatter
there
you
go
the
new
holland
white
hatter
is
very
nice
i
am
trying
a
2012
vintage
i
poured
the
beer
in
a
tulip
glass
and
it
is
light
copper
with
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
slight
lace
the
smell
provides
coriander
and
slight
pine
tones
the
taste
has
the
scent
plus
some
peppery
kicks
the
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
and
certainly
worth
a
try

awesome

extremely

fantastic
and
i
really
did
not
expect
it
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
a
welcomed
surprise
overall
refreshing
is
the
word
great
for
a
sunny
summer
day
only
drawback
being
that
its
not
really
a
sipping
beer
you
could
down
this
stuff
like
gatorade
at
four
times
the
price
and
alcohol
very
much
a
seasonal
beer
but
an
overachiever
in
its
own
right
strongly
recommend
yes
very
good
indeed
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
unique
flavor
but
on
reading
other
review
yes
i
think
it
is
grapefruit
rind
good
summer
brew
only
problem
is
that
its
hit
or
miss
on
whether
stores
have
in
stock
the
remainder
of
this
review
is
to
bump
me
up
to
the
250
character
minimum
this
beer
pours
hazy
orange
with
an
underwhelming
white
head
the
beer
has
a
ligt
fruity
aroma
from
the
hops
this
beer
is
all
about
the
hops
the
hop
profile
is
really
mid
country
there
is
a
lot
of
pineapple
orange
and
lemons
zestas
well
as
a
lot
of
other
fruity
notes
i
did
not
get
much
of
the
white
aspect
of
this
beer
but
i
bet
it
would
be
easier
to
differentiate
by
doing
a
side
by
side
with
the
classic
mad
hatter
drinks
really
easy
and
quite
refreshing
a
great
white
ipa
if
my
memory
serves
me
right
i
like
this
more
then
the
original
but
i
didnt
have
the
original
fresh
from
the
tap
o
very
enjoyable
belgian
pale
ale
really
enjoyed
the
aromatics
and
flavors
and
the
slight
hint
of
coconut
makes
this
brew
different
from
most
others
and
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
to
compare
o
nice
white
ale
almost
witbeer
like
malting
with
a
pale
ale
bitterness
that
was
smooth
tart
but
refreshing
as
a
summer
drink
o
this
is
an
interesting
ale
it
definitely
blurs
style
boundaries
overall
a
good
belgianinfluenced
wheat
beer
with
substantial
complexity
finish
was
a
bit
short
and
dry
o
new
hollands
white
hatter
is
a
harmonious
masterpiece
that
could
quite
possibly
be
my
favorite
of
their
offerings
this
delicious
treat
skillfully
blends
a
moderately
hopped
ipa
with
the
subtleties
and
drinkability
of
a
witbier
for
a
refreshing
supertasty
outcome

a
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
massive
frothy
head
when
poured
smells
a
bit
funky
with
definite
pine
hops
and
some
lemon
peel
equal
notes
of
ipa
with
the
pine
and
light
lemon
and
spicy
belgian
witbier
with
the
hint
of
honey
sweetness
and
clove
light
mouthfeel
and
plenty
of
carbonation
not
usually
big
on
this
style
but
though
that
this
was
nicely
done
but
somehow
i
rather
enjoyed
this
hastily
stitched
together
beer
i
still
feel
that
witbier
is
a
formidable
base
style
to
experiment
with
high
hop
character
although
its
alcohol
is
slight
and
and
the
support
is
sparse
i
rather
enjoy
the
complex
complement
of
spice
to
hops
and
feel
theres
a
lot
of
potential
if
the
witbier
part
were
more
authentic
but
not
a
bad
experiment
in
the
least
and
actually
what
do
you
know
but
halfway
in
the
best
of
its
parts
outshine
the
least
liking
it
more
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
is
slightly
hazy
and
very
faint
straw
in
color
thin
white
head
with
dense
bubble
has
nice
retention
and
a
considerable
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
very
spicy
with
significant
waves
of
coriander
cloves
orange
peel
along
with
plenty
of
earthy
hops
the
nose
is
incredibly
floral
and
fragrant
the
taste
matches
the
nose
with
flowers
and
spices
up
front
the
beginning
is
all
white
ale
the
finish
features
a
nice
wave
of
hop
bitterness
this
is
an
interesing
combo
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
other
belgian
pale
ales
with
more
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
wiith
a
nice
balance
overall
this
is
worth
a
try
not
the
best
of
the
hatter
variants
but
interesting
nonetheless
o
really
not
much
of
a
belgian
pale
with
only
a
light
amount
of
belgian
yeast
characteristics
and
just
not
a
whole
lot
of
anything
else
in
the
mix
simplistic
watery
and
in
the
end
just
a
fairly
average
beer
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
i
have
liked
the
other
beers
in
the
hatter
series
but
this
one
is
not
to
my
liking
trying
to
merge
a
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
witbier
is
a
bad
idea
hazy
light
golden
with
a
finger
of
persistent
head
leaves
copious
lace
smell
is
simply
faint
slightly
fruity
hoppy
i
suppose
but
thats
stretching
it
taste
is
lightly
hoppy
citric
fruity
tropical
refreshing
im
not
sure
if
its
belgian
or
a
pale
ale
but
its
pretty
tasty
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
but
it
fits
the
style
with
a
crisp
carbonation
not
much
on
the
nose
but
no
matter
its
a
tasty
beer
this
one
is
worth
checking
out
especially
if
you
are
not
a
style
purist
sort
of
person
one
of
the
hoppier
belgian
ipas

750
ml
bottle
into
my
grape
and
gourmet
store
tulip
hazy
apricot
color
with
a
big
delicately
bubbly
white
head
head
retention
is
better
than
average
and
the
head
looks
more
frothy
after
the
bubbles
die
down
aroma
is
citrus
and
floral
hops
not
much
in
the
way
of
belgian
beer
aspects
flavor
adds
some
belgian
yeast
and
some
light
fruit
to
the
big
hoppy
presence
the
yeast
is
fairly
prominent
and
adds
the
belgian
to
the
belgian
ipa
mouthfeel
is
crisp
bitter
and
fairly
rich
overall
an
interesting
and
well
crafted
beer
overall
delicious
feels
substantial
in
every
way
hop
profile
is
like
an
american
pale
ale
and
it
goes
well
with
the
belgian
style
yeasts
gives
it
more
depth
very
well
balanced
with
a
great
level
of
complexity
nice
rubyorange
hazy
coloring
with
a
huge
head
of
tight
aromatic
bubbles
fair
amount
of
citrus
and
melon
in
the
aroma
more
citrus
a
touch
of
pine
marshmallow
and
pith
in
the
taste
moderate
carbonation
yet
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
some
yeasty
funkiness
in
this
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
well
done

o
very
good
blend
of
american
ipa
and
a
belgian
tons
of
flavor
o
ive
been
meaning
to
try
this
one
for
awhile
and
i
wasnt
exactly
sure
what
to
expect
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
onebelgian
ipa
seems
to
be
a
style
with
a
lot
of
range
and
this
one
was
fruitier
and
smoother
than
many
others
ive
had
ill
definitely
have
it
again
when
its
on
tap
or
when
i
come
across
a
bottle
o
this
was
a
great
surprise
i
tend
to
not
like
the
belgian
flavor
profiles
to
be
strong
particularly
the
banana
notes
this
however
was
more
restrained
and
the
biterness
made
a
nice
balance
with
the
soursweetness
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
an
imperial
belgian
ipa
with
some
more
hop
and
abv
o
not
exactly
one
of
the
best
things
allagash
has
ever
done
nor
is
it
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
ever
had
but
its
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
revisit
it
if
given
the
chance
overall
an
intense
beer
that
the
flavors
are
a
bit
too
intense
for
me
the
dryness
eats
right
up
the
rest
of
the
flavor
allagash
has
yet
another
great
beer
with
the
hugh
malone
appearance
resembles
the
allagash
style
with
moderately
cloudy
but
very
nice
color
deep
orange
the
smell
was
very
good
but
not
outstanding
taste
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
i
was
very
surprised
with
the
citrus
mixed
with
a
little
bit
of
pine
taste
the
belgian
yeasts
adds
that
nice
belgian
flavor
and
keeps
you
coming
back
not
a
session
beer
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
highly
recommend
an
extremely
well
constructed
belgian
ipa
o
a
nice
belgian
ipa
from
allagash
plenty
of
hops
in
there
so
its
probably
better
off
drank
fresh
if
youve
got
some
extra
cash
and
enjoy
the
style
then
pick
some
up
overall
gash
never
disappoints
this
is
a
good
brew
but
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
allagash
is
one
of
those
breweries
that
never
disappoints
while
hugh
malone
is
far
from
their
strongest
release
it
is
a
nice
belgian
ipa
the
alcohol
flavors
a
little
strong
but
thats
the
only
real
complaint
i
have
pretty
solid
allaround
otherwise
worth
checking
out
for
sure

the
aroma
lots

yeast
hops
and
clean

upfront
malty

finally
hoppy
and
a

the
beer
finishes
quickly
and
is
dry
as
it
warms
on
the
2nd
pint
the
volatile
alcohols
come
out
stronger
overall
although
not
a
style
i
gravitate
towards
this
is
a
well
done
beer
with
loads
of
malt
hops
and
yeast
balanced
in
unison
for
a
drinkable
big
beer
o
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
belgian
ipa
with
good
smell
and
taste
the
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
dandelion
yellow
coloring
with
a
thin
small
bubbled
clingy
white
head
and
a
slow
steady
flow
of
carbonation
bubbling
aromas
of
floral
hops
jasmine
and
a
spiciness
imparted
from
the
yeast
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
toasted
grains
very
mild
well
blended
aromas
flavors
are
very
well
blended
riding
a
thin
sharp
body
roasted
and
resiny
hopped
forward
flavor
with
a
floral
and
bitter
component
as
the
brew
crosses
your
tongue
slight
buttery
biscuit
backbone
which
supports
the
hops
profile
a
touch
of
fruity
and
funky
highlights
can
be
gleamed
throughout
too
tart
fruity
and
hoppy
aftertaste
with
the
fruit
taking
over
into
the
finish
along
with
a
touch
of
resin
and
bitter
clean
crisp
finish
very
tasty
drinkable
brew
m
medium
bodied
overall
a
wellrounded
beer
maybe
a
tad
too
much
spice
flavor
but
the
mouthfeel
makes
up
for
it
o
you
get
a
clean
sense
with
each
taste
and
swallow
hop
presence
wasnt
where
i
would
like
but
than
again
im
a
hop
fiend
the
belgian
strain
sense
of
apples
and
carbonation
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
for
me
its
nothing
earth
shattering
but
its
a
pleasant
belgian
ipa
i
would
recommend
to
try
at
least
once
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
it
started
out
w
two
strikes
against
what
i
typically
enjoy
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgians
or
wheat
beers
but
this
is
pulled
of
nicley
and
if
you
a
fan
if
the
style
if
suggest
that
this
is
a
must
try
b
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
cooling
spicy
aroma
and
solid
flavoring
the
nose
was
so
inclusive
with
the
aforementioned
accolades
along
with
intense
bittering
hoppiness
and
graininess
that
makes
you
want
to
sip
it
again
and
again
the
taste
acts
only
to
confirm
this
drive
the
feel
does
so
doubly
this
is
the
reason
we
love
belgian
ipas
this
is
the
way
i
like
my
ipas
it
is
not
too
harsh
but
presents
itself
enough
to
satisfy
a
fine
tribute
to
an
early
pioneer
of
the
maine
brewing
industry
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
a
golden
yellowlight
orange
color
with
a
two
finger
white
cap
that
fills
the
tulip
the
nose
is
of
sweet
bready
malt
earth
and
citrus
with
astringent
fruity
notes
from
the
belgian
yeast
this
could
almost
double
as
a
hoppy
saison
on
the
palate
fruity
notes
up
front
with
an
astringent
feel
through
the
middle
earthy
notes
and
some
light
fruit
apple
come
out
in
the
finish
before
a
mild
citric
bitterness
a
little
bit
of
spice
dots
the
landscape
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
a
prickly
feel
solid
flavor
throughout
with
a
decent
dose
of
bitterness
wellbalanced
a
tasty
belgian
ipa
that
toes
the
line
of
saison
in
spots
i
love
a
good
belgian
ipa
and
while
this
one
doesnt
wow
me
it
is
definitely
welcome
in
my
glass
anytime
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
some
lingering
bitterness
on
the
end
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
and
should
try
to
grab
a
bottle
when
i
get
the
chance
pretty
solid
bipa
and
looking
forward
bto
more
in
the
future
i
downgraded
this
beer
because
it
really
falls
off
when
it
warms
you
get
a
lot
of
bitterness
and
a
little
metallic
taste
i
recommend
sharing
this
bottle
to
enjoy
it
at
the
best
temperature
o
quite
refreshing
drinks
smooth
lots
of
subtle
flavors
that
complement
each
other
leaves
a
piney
aftertaste
really
glad
i
tried
it
not
sure
it
is
worth
23750ml
but
uniquely
enjoyable
overall
a
great
beer
i
am
going
to
try
to
find
a
newer
bottle
and
compare
overall
this
brew
is
a
hop
lovers
belgian
dream
got
to
give
it
up
to
this
brewer
once
again
seems
everything
they
brew
is
quite
tasty
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
randomly
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
and
some
soapy
and
floral
hop
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
exactly
the
same
with
a
medium
level
of
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
belgian
take
on
an
ipa
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
another
wonderful
one
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
us
or
the
world
hugh
malone
is
a
warmweather
beer
that
would
go
well
with
fish
o
this
was
pretty
tasty
i
quite
enjoyed
the
balance
and
the
crispness
of
the
beer
for
my
personal
preference
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
on
the
ipa
side
than
the
belgian
side
but
i
certainly
didnt
mind
it
the
overall
does
have
to
take
a
bit
of
a
hit
from
the
price
sadly
which
is
simply
too
high
a
common
problem
ive
found
from
allagash
o
this
belgian
ipa
is
a
very
unique
ale
i
certainly
like
it
very
much
if
youre
an
ipa
fan
or
a
belgian
fan
youll
likely
enjoy
this
beer
i
recommend
it
for
sure
overall
this
one
reminds
me
of
going
in
to
a
bath
and
body
shop
really
soapy
still
thought
it
was
good
but
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
especially
given
the
price
of
a
bottle
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
the
bloated
price
tag
i
got
it
for
the
holidays
thinking
it
would
be
a
nice
treat
for
the
family
get
together
again
it
was
a
solid
ipa
but
not
worth
twice
the
price
of
similar
beers
o
im
turned
off
from
this
style
due
to
the
bitter
grassiness
that
i
mentioned
this
one
doesnt
have
that
quality
and
its
a
better
beer
for
it
drinkability
this
beer
is
so
smooth
the
sugared
grapefruit
flavor
really
grabbed
my
taste
buds
and
kept
me
coming
back
sip
after
sip
full
bodied
carbonation
and
a
palate
cleansing
bitterness
the
belgian
yeast
hold
things
together
really
well
solid
brew
o
pricey
beer
18
but
to
be
expected
with
allagash
quality
beer
despite
being
kept
for
longer
than
optimal
tasted
great
poured
into
snifter
o
its
a
good
brew
not
worth
the
price
at
meadhall
but
a
good
brew
none
the
less
allagash
is
always
top
notch
overall
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
i
have
had
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
and
the
hops
are
not
as
biting
as
some
belgian
ipas
this
one
is
really
smooth
and
super
easy
to
drink
i
could
definitely
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
o
usually
not
a
style
that
i
really
like
but
this
is
a
very
well
done
bipa
i
really
like
the
hop
combination
here
and
the
spicy
yeast
character
works
really
well
a
very
nice
beer
o
very
good
belgian
ipa
very
tastey
and
perfect
balance
on
this
brew
o
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
from
allagash
good
take
on
the
style
very
nice
spices
my
accidental
highway
to
hell
tour
begins
right
here
i
know
youre
pumped
it
pours
a
lightly
hazy
pale
yellow
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
mandarin
orange
syrup
wet
hay
light
pineapple
and
a
touch
o
banana
peel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
banana
peel
lemon
rind
orange
rind
light
orange
zest
very
light
clove
melon
grass
and
a
few
pinches
of
brown
sugar
and
nutmeg
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
bipa
though
nothing
overtly
special
or
outstanding
taste
if
full
belgian
hoppy
ipa
coats
the
tongue
of
alcohol
and
yeasty
fruit
very
tastey
and
a
satisfying
brew
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
get
again
although
its
a
pretty
good
beer
of
the
style
its
also
probably
the
most
expensive
version
of
the
style
ive
ever
seen
for
that
reason
alone
it
will
be
a
one
time
purchase
for
me
as
there
are
too
many
alternatives
for
a
fraction
of
the
cost
for
what
i
paid
i
could
have
probably
bought
a
dozen
raging
bitches
instead
the
golden
color
and
thick
alabaster
34
head
invited
me
warmly
into
this
potent
belgian
ipa
the
9
ounce
pour
had
a
nice
bubbly
appearance
with
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
its
nose
definitely
had
strong
pine
and
grapefruit
notes
which
also
came
thru
once
i
tasted
it
this
finish
was
crisp
and
my
food
match
choice
woule
be
fish
and
chips
overall
a
very
nice
beer
by
allagash
not
the
best
allagash
ive
had
and
definitely
not
the
best
ipa
or
belgian
ipa
for
that
matter
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
20
bucks
a
bottle
at
my
local
shop
however
would
make
me
run
away
i
probably
will
never
buy
this
bottled
on
tap
for
7
bucks
though
it
was
worth
it
good
job
once
again
allagash
overall
it
is
kind
of
a
pricey
brew
for
my
budget
now
but
i
spoil
myself
with
good
beer
here
and
there
and
this
is
well
worth
it
if
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
i
would
gladly
enjoy
but
i
believe
it
is
only
brewed
once
a
year
and
i
guess
that
is
factor
as
well
if
i
see
it
again
i
will
pick
it
up
i
suggest
if
you
were
interested
enough
to
read
this
review
then
you
should
try
this
ale
too
poured
into
an
allagash
stem
glass
this
ipa
was
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
frothy
puff
of
white
head
that
retained
well
and
left
some
decent
lacing
brilliant
aroma
of
herbal
and
citrus
hops
and
a
cornucopia
of
fresh
fruit
as
it
approached
my
lips
i
actually
got
the
sensation
of
a
west
coast
ipa
hops
and
more
hops
grassy
and
citric
orange
blossom
and
honey
all
overlaid
on
a
solid
sweet
malt
base
mellows
out
towards
the
end
and
leaves
a
nice
dry
finish
medium
mouthfeel
and
quite
the
quaffable
ipa
goes
great
with
food
i
will
try
this
one
again
a
hazed
but
glowing
amber
color
with
cap
of
dense
white
froth
good
lacing
scent
is
strong
on
juicy
and
fruity
citrus
hops
strong
orange
and
candied
sugar
notes
backed
by
a
faint
grain
whiff
light
spice
and
bready
yeast
taste
leads
with
the
orange
and
tangerine
notes
spice
and
bready
yeasts
come
through
before
the
beer
mellows
into
a
fresh
grain
backbone
medium
bodied
a
touch
of
oily
heft
bubbly
a
very
nice
surprise
good
fruity
belgian
ipa
overall
it
is
pretty
good
nothing
to
special
for
the
price
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
the
head
was
long
lasting
and
left
a
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
gave
off
plenty
of
hop
aromas
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
light
bready
flavor
to
it
with
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
this
had
a
good
strong
bite
to
it
with
each
sip
the
yeast
didnt
really
soften
this
beer
up
too
much
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
belgian
style
ipa
but
not
my
favorite
o
very
well
made
beer
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
allagash
o
looks
amazing
smells
amazing
though
good
this
tastes
like
a
typical
belgian
ipa
read
as
disappointing
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
was
a
bit
out
of
balance
for
my
taste
there
is
something
about
it
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
is
like
it
has
a
very
subtle
wild
character
but
not
enough
to
contribute
anything
but
an
anomaly
in
the
flavor
that
said
it
is
probably
just
an
earthy
hops
that
i
am
misinterpreting
or
something
either
way
i
will
certainly
drink
the
whole
bottle
but
they
make
others
that
i
enjoy
a
lot
more
than
i
have
this
one
jd
a
relatively
uninteresting
and
bland
belgian
ipa
what
flavors
that
are
here
are
pleasant
enough
but
theyre
hiding
1012010
pours
a
hazy
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
fresh
hops
and
not
to
incriminate
myself
kind
of
like
a
bag
of
weed
in
the
taste
dry
pine
hops
and
a
light
yeasty
presence
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
hop
and
yeasty
aftertaste
big
hops
and
mellow
belgian
like
qualities
quite
enjoyable
o
overall
a
pretty
good
belgian
ipa
though
i
feel
like
the
belgian
notes
get
a
bit
overwhelmed
by
the
hops
theyre
definitely
there
but
dont
balance
well
with
the
hop
flavors
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
abv
is
low
enough
were
i
can
take
down
an
entire
bottle
and
not
feel
to
buzzed
taste
is
pleasing
goes
down
smoothly
and
the
dryness
keeps
you
comming
back
for
more
this
must
be
one
of
the
first
allagash
brews
i
have
not
enjoyed
from
the
pour
the
beer
looked
amazing
a
murky
golden
orange
with
very
thick
foam
and
a
bitter
citrus
smell
i
was
pretty
excited
but
after
my
first
sip
i
realized
something
was
a
little
off
the
bitterness
i
smelled
turned
into
a
round
sour
taste
not
sharp
sour
like
a
flemish
sour
ale
but
round
sour
like
old
milk
im
not
sure
if
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
or
if
this
was
their
intention
but
it
didnt
work
for
me
the
orange
and
citrus
notes
redeemed
it
enough
to
make
it
drinkable
but
there
was
something
acrid
about
the
taste
that
really
put
me
off
all
around
im
a
huge
allagash
fan
so
im
hoping
and
guessing
this
was
just
an
off
bottle
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
considering
its
alcohol
content
my
first
allagash
and
it
wont
be
my
last
nice
foam
head
on
the
pour
it
is
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
dont
let
the
high
abv
scare
you
off
primarily
citrus
and
pine
taste
with
belgian
yeast
going
around
there
might
be
something
better
out
there
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
start
to
me
smooth
to
start
and
then
gentle
carbonation
hops
balances
the
sweetness
and
finishes
with
slight
bitter
smooth
and
clean
im
glad
to
share
this
beer
but
the
drinkability
is
so
high
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
all
to
myself
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
the
best
in
the
style
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
though
d
amazing
fantastically
refreshing
great
brew
the
yeast
flavors
are
very
prominent
bready
and
fruity
and
a
bit
sour
hops
blend
in
with
a
grainy
herbal
bitterness
that
is
quite
pronounced
listed
as
8
5
abv
here
but
my
bottle
says
7
8
on
the
label
either
way
the
alcohol
didnt
show
up
much
if
at
all
very
drinkable
a
decent
take
on
the
style
i
find
that
belgian
ipas
end
up
either
on
the
hoppy
american
side
or
the
yeasty
belgian
side
but
this
one
seems
to
walk
the
line
pretty
well
compared
to
most
d
excellent
representation
of
a
style
that
im
not
particularly
fond
of
leans
much
closer
to
belgian
than
american
drinks
well
but
i
dont
see
myself
making
a
repeat
purchase
for
b
beer
d
another
well
made
drinkable
beer
from
allagash
d
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
on
tap
that
from
the
bottle
the
hops
really
come
out
more
and
give
this
brew
a
freshness
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
d
one
of
my
favorites
from
allagash
although
ive
never
had
it
from
a
bottle
its
fantastic
on
tap
hops
are
really
put
on
display
on
tap
at
picco
live
review
poured
into
an
allagash
tulip
glass
golden
yellow
orange
color
with
thick
white
head
and
excellent
lacing
complex
smell
and
taste
which
are
quite
similar
combination
of
spicy
peppery
and
pine
which
ultimately
wins
out
combined
with
fruity
hints
which
are
there
but
fleeting
citrus
banana
keep
thinking
peach
pretty
smooth
feel
liking
this
one
but
wouldnt
go
for
more
than
a
couple
d
an
ok
belgian
ipa
but
there
was
something
in
the
smell
and
taste
that
seemed
like
mint
to
me
that
was
offputting
not
sure
exactly
what
it
was
decent
but
probably
would
not
have
again
not
the
easiest
one
to
finish
a
little
overwhelming
not
in
a
good
way
hmm
not
sure
this
was
worth
the
outoftowner
price
i
dropped
for
it
the
high
points
were
pretty
standard
for
the
style
which
is
still
to
say
good
the
low
points
were
a
turnoff
the
alcohol
wore
too
much
wasnt
justified
by
the
flavor
decent
enough
but
not
my
fave
by
a
long
shot
awesome
very
drinkable
complex
tasty
no
date
but
had
for
at
least
a
year
this
is
a
great
beer
with
some
age
on
it
drinkability
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
the
hops
were
subdued
enough
to
let
the
yeast
flavors
be
fully
experienced
not
sure
if
its
worth
buying
a
bottle
but
nonetheless
a
pleasure
2010
version
on
draught
served
in
a
nice
allagash
glass
bright
and
vibrant
orange
with
a
soapy
foam
head
lots
of
bready
aromas
and
a
nice
woodsy
hop
bouquet
in
the
nose
wow
lots
of
hops
moreso
than
i
remember
upon
sampling
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
maybe
they
have
stepped
up
the
hoppage
in
recent
years
to
follow
the
trends
citrusy
and
sharp
but
with
musty
earth
underpinnings
yeasty
and
doughy
all
at
once
a
pretty
darn
tasty
combination
nice
body
and
heft
on
the
palate
and
a
fun
one
to
drink
shooting
so
many
flavors
at
you
without
overmucking
the
beer
a
winner
a
well
made
beer
just
not
one
that
wows
me
d
this
was
a
great
beer
with
perfect
balance
and
bright
crisp
taste
it
was
a
delicious
mix
of
bitter
and
sour
and
funky
and
sweet
it
had
perfect
body
too
so
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
not
for
aging
but
very
nice
fresh
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
an
ipa
but
this
could
be
the
belgian
take
on
it
it
seems
more
like
a
belgian
strong
ale
but
there
is
hop
character
to
this
one
i
think
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
would
pair
well
with
pungent
cheeses
salty
meats
and
olives
decent
but
unlikely
to
go
back
to
this
at
19
per
bottle
a
great
beer
for
summer
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
citrus
fruits
mainly
lemon
with
some
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
belgian
yeast
as
well
as
lemons
and
oranges
the
hop
bitterness
is
there
but
it
is
not
front
and
center
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
this
wasnt
my
favorite
allagash
offering
not
bad
or
anything
but
not
particularly
interesting
and
certainly
not
what
i
expected
from
the
listed
style
of
belgian
ipa
drinkability
a
rather
large
bottle
with
the
alcohol
shining
through
makes
it
a
good
bottle
for
an
evening
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
more
hops
on
the
palate
mingling
with
some
of
the
spices
from
the
belgian
side
of
the
story
nonetheless
a
well
put
together
beer
thats
enjoyable
and
id
like
to
try
again
in
a
few
years
served
from
bottle
into
a
chimay
goblet
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
lacing
is
minimal
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
only
mild
hops
the
flavor
was
comprised
of
nice
spicy
and
sweet
hops
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
medium
carbonation
overall
this
brew
had
an
excellent
flavor
for
an
ipa
and
the
sweetness
aspect
was
a
welcome
change
from
typical
ipas
and
made
it
more
refreshing
this
was
a
nice
brew
with
bold
flavoring
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
complex
enough
that
one
single
meeting
cant
possibly
give
up
all
its
secrets
who
is
hugh
malone
and
whats
he
and
this
molecular
structure
doing
on
the
label
of
this
beer
time
for
some
research
i
reckon
fine
stuff
which
is
par
for
the
course
from
allagash
at
the
very
least
the
taste
is
filled
with
a
light
caramel
toffee
taste
there
is
a
belgian
yeast
flavor
that
adds
a
slight
sour
earthy
taste
but
is
not
in
your
face
at
all
there
is
a
citrusy
grass
flavor
as
well
the
taste
ends
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
though
it
is
light
bitterness
it
seems
there
is
a
mix
of
british
and
belgian
style
in
this
beer
it
is
quite
complex
and
smooth
the
carbonation
is
medium
overall
a
nice
belgian
ipa
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
price
but
it
is
very
nice
ale
taste
isn
too
hoppy
for
an
ipa
but
its
got
a
nice
bite
to
it
with
a
vey
fresh
clean
finish
makes
for
a
great
summer
beer
a
bit
of
bad
followup
one
night
at
lord
hobo
starting
off
with
some
rich
dark
ales
as
this
one
was
quite
the
transition
although
a
bit
a
palate
readjuster
for
later
brews
golden
yellow
with
some
haze
and
a
bright
white
fluffy
2
fingers
of
light
head
sticky
lace
the
aroma
was
somewhat
mild
evoking
a
peppery
lemon
yeast
the
flavor
likewise
did
the
same
in
a
creamy
but
still
quite
easy
to
drink
crisp
bubbly
refreshing
way
pretty
basic
but
a
nice
summer
beer
if
you
can
it
cheap
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
not
sure
how
often
i
would
order
this
but
not
lacking
personality
and
has
pretty
good
balance
lemony
hop
profile
could
be
more
interesting
and
more
yeasty
spice
or
malt
would
make
the
beer
less
direct
on
the
palate
and
more
interesting
slainte
d
damn
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
something
i
would
enjoy
sipping
on
again
as
its
quite
easy
to
drink
dangerously
so
for
8
59
5
a
close
friend
brought
over
a
750ml
bottle
to
share
poured
a
glowing
honeyorange
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
into
my
sa
glass
i
am
a
hop
head
and
the
smell
was
glorious
lots
of
resinous
piney
hops
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
whiff
of
belgian
yeast
taste
was
a
hop
explosion
with
lots
of
pine
notes
well
balanced
by
the
sweet
malt
and
yeast
notes
incredible
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
after
every
sip
i
am
indeed
lucky
to
have
a
friend
share
such
a
fabulous
beer
with
me
on
tap
at
brick
store
pub
poured
into
an
allagash
tulip
inch
of
white
foam
rests
atop
a
golden
body
aroma
is
fruity
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
funk
taste
is
unique
in
an
allagash
sort
of
way
the
allagash
funk
adds
an
interesting
twist
to
this
style
i
think
the
sour
actually
overpowers
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
not
in
a
bad
way
if
you
go
into
this
beer
expecting
a
beer
typical
of
the
style
you
may
be
let
down
go
into
it
expecting
an
allagash
version
of
a
belgian
ipa
youll
be
richly
rewarded
not
bad
solid
but
the
oily
and
soapy
hops
detract
a
little
to
much
for
me
overall
this
was
a
good
looking
belgian
ipa
but
in
terms
of
flavor
it
wasnt
quite
up
there
with
the
big
boys
still
its
worth
a
shot
overall
big
ups
to
a
great
trader
for
putting
this
in
my
hands
i
would
get
this
again
for
the
smell
alone
the
taste
is
no
deterrent
either
the
750
will
be
no
problem
for
one
sitting
good
the
feel
is
ok
decent
drinkability
d
better
when
fresh
one
glass
is
enough
quite
a
nice
beer
from
allagash
it
pours
out
an
even
brown
clor
with
a
bit
of
a
flimsy
lightly
colored
head
malty
flavored
beer
with
a
lot
caramelroasted
flavors
and
a
toffee
sort
of
tone
good
complexity
easy
to
drink
this
bottle
was
aged
for
a
couple
years
prior
to
drinking
ive
never
had
it
fresh
so
i
dont
know
if
the
complexities
change
at
all
over
time
a
pretty
nice
brew
though
the
price
is
a
bit
on
the
steep
side
drinkability
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
which
at
9
5
is
a
danger
if
the
hops
were
toned
down
a
hair
or
perhaps
if
another
more
floral
or
less
intense
variety
were
used
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
get
bumped
half
a
point
in
drink
and
taste
easily
excellent
brew
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
sometime
out
east
but
from
the
bottle
this
is
another
fine
beer
from
the
folks
at
allagash
ill
be
serving
the
other
bottle
at
my
birthday
tasting
party
sometime
in
january
i
suspect
hugh
will
go
over
well
with
those
who
are
not
craft
beer
nuts
overall
great
brew
showcasing
belgian
and
american
highlights
worked
great
with
the
spicy
chili
i
was
eating
tastesfeels
great
for
a
belgian
ipa
examples
like
stricklander
or
calibelgique
are
too
pale
and
thin
the
lack
of
filtering
really
does
it
some
good
i
usually
however
like
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
take
the
sting
out
of
the
hops
the
belgian
yeast
is
a
different
approach
and
isnt
quite
my
favorite
on
tap
at
the
church
key
in
dc
beautiful
orange
pour
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
on
top
that
leaves
perfect
lacing
as
it
drains
hard
to
top
lookswise
strong
hoppy
nose
big
with
fruit
and
citrus
all
over
the
place
flavor
is
huge
as
well
tons
of
caramel
malt
mixed
perfectly
with
that
big
citrusy
hop
backbone
actually
quite
similar
to
an
american
ipadipa
in
terms
of
that
monsterous
hops
presence
but
the
flavor
itself
is
a
little
bigger
even
than
your
standard
ipa
a
really
excellent
beer
another
tasty
and
unique
monster
from
allagash
this
is
what
i
dont
like
about
belgian
ipas
the
styles
of
belgian
beers
used
for
the
platform
for
the
bittering
and
flavoring
hops
are
delicate
beers
to
begin
with
they
are
actually
tripels
with
very
subtle
flavor
characteristics
that
end
up
completely
overwhelmed
by
bitterness
this
beer
is
no
exception
when
i
drink
a
beer
like
this
i
think
what
would
this
beer
be
like
without
the
hops
probably
a
belgian
strong
pale
another
beer
that
is
not
known
for
its
over
the
top
malt
character
or
fruity
spiciness
but
a
clean
bright
flavor
the
hop
bitterness
is
what
is
most
present
in
this
beer
the
citrus
flavors
almost
orange
peel
is
present
in
the
mid
and
some
in
the
front
there
is
moderate
to
mild
sweetness
at
the
front
but
overall
the
hops
mask
almost
everything
this
beer
is
bright
and
bitter
drinkability
moderate
mouthfeel
is
fine
beer
is
a
little
thin
for
my
tastes
drinkability
i
just
loved
this
beer
it
was
rich
flavorful
unique
and
exciting
i
dont
know
how
you
would
rate
it
to
the
style
but
for
me
this
was
excellent

i
will
certainly
be
picking
up

more
of

this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
had
to
date
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
thought
id
do
a
review
of
an
aged
bottle
over
a
fresh
one
should
people
want
to
keep
and
try
older
bottles
d
high
going
back
to
clear
out
the
stock
i
found
this
beer
to
be
more
complex
than
what
most
reviews
allude
to
i
also
noticed
the
number
one
complaint
about
this
beer
was
the
price
point
as
some
paid
1520
for
this
one
at
8
79
i
feel
like
i
hit
paydirt
this
beer
is
amazing
for
the
price
i
looove
this
beer
nothing
really
off
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
allagash
its
hard
to
compete
with
the
belgians
and
since
this
is
a
oneoff
product
it
may
have
been
rushed
a
bit
but
overall
its
a
solid
beer
but
weak
categorically
it
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
up
and
the
yeast
was
swirled
and
poured
in
in
the
second
pour
but
the
750ml
was
quite
enough
thank
you
overall
really
complex
stab
at
this
style
im
not
really
sure
exactly
where
it
fits
style
wise
i
guess
belgian
ipa
works
sort
of
a
style
defying
brew
in
my
opinion
worth
the
chance
to
try
if
your
into
beers
that
finish
really
dry
and
if
you
like
allagash
because
they
dont
make
many
hoppy
brews
which
this
definitely
is
overall
one
of
the
top
american
belgian
style
ipas
but
i
have
a
feeling
this
bottle
was
older
than
others
ive
tried
and
the
hops
have
mellowed
out
a
bit
im
cheating
a
bit
and
upping
the
score
a
bit
based
on
those
other
tastings
score
would
be
even
higher
if
i
had
taken
notes
the
times
ive
had
it
on
tap
hmmm
probably
not
in
the
upper
tier
of
brews
but
still
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
i
felt
that
the
sweetness
hindered
the
drinkability
for
me
and
if
that
could
be
reduced
this
could
be
a
real
winner
serving
type
bottle
d
this
is
an
extremely
pleasant
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
not
terribly
dynamic
but
its
wellrounded
overall
d
a
solid
example
of
the
belgian
ipa
style
the
only
problem
is
with
the
17
price
tag
im
expecting
something
exceptional
not
just
a
good
beer
which
this
is
if
its
ever
ontap
im
sure
to
revisit
it
hv
reviewed
on
06222009
i
had
this
on
draft
pours
gold
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
breadyyeasty
malt
with
spices
and
sweet
fruit
flavor
of
sweet
fruits
initially
with
a
yeasty
finish
pretty
tasty
although
i
dont
get
the
hops
good
bsa
though
d
this
is
interesting
and
complex
though
subtle
i
dont
know
if
its
something
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
especially
for
the
price
but
it
would
make
a
nice
afterdinner
drink
obviously
i
really
like
this
beer
but
it
makes
me
wonder
what
this
tastes
like
when
new
and
what
impact
the
aging
had
on
it
i
see
no
date
code
anywhere
on
the
bottle
so
hard
to
say
how
old
it
was
when
i
bought
it
frankly
i
expected
it
to
be
more
hop
intensive
and
i
suppose
the
aging
mellowed
this
somewhat
but
in
any
case
i
am
extremely
satisfied
with
the
results
everyone
complains
about
the
price
yes
i
think
i
paid
something
like
16
99
for
this
bottle
with
1
going
to
charity
it
is
still
expensive
but
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
it
well
worth
it
i
will
look
for
it
again
an
okay
belgian
ipa
seems
like
there
was
too
much
orange
peel
flavor
in
this
one
for
me
drinkability
is
very
good
this
belgian
ipa
is
great
and
i
am
very
happy
to
have
finally
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
it
very
nice
beer
and
worth
your
time
and
so
ends
another
round
of
the
t
u
i
see
you
again
tomorrow
morning
when
i
will
hold
a
breakfast
special
a
beligan
carbonated
american
ipa
pours
a
murky
orange
yellow
with
a
off
white
head
that
is
consistent
but
doesnt
hold
like
a
belgian
nose
of
lemon
zest
and
grapefruit
hop
peppery
palate
is
a
dry
lemon
sharper
acid
in
comparison
to
most
doesnt
have
a
compatible
malt
style
to
what
im
used
to
carbonation
is
a
bit
aggressive
on
the
tongue
goes
horribly
with
the
bitter
finish
of
the
beer
dont
waste
your
time
having
this
one
on
tap
i
think
i
mellows
out
a
bit
better
in
the
bottle
notes
this
is
good
beer
i
loved
the
citrus
and
pineflavored
hops
on
top
of
the
belgianinspired
base
for
this
brew
but
it
just
lacked
the
complexity
to
blow
me
away
all
of
the
flavors
seem
to
mingle
nicely
together
i
was
afraid
the
hops
would
outshine
the
competition
but
they
dont
because
they
seem
rather
subdued
and
muddled
in
the
midst
of
things
still
pretty
enjoyable
d
pretty
good
but
at
17
a
bottle
definitely
not
worth
it
pours
a
pale
amber
color
with
an
inch
and
a
half
of
pillowy
head
lacing
is
consistent
through
out
the
length
of
the
beer
slight
hops
aroma
which
diminishes
with
the
taste
where
a
slight
earthy
belgian
yeast
is
absorbed
by
the
tongue
mouthfeel
has
decent
carbonation
not
as
hoppy
as
some
other
belgian
ipas
but
definetly
hoppy
for
a
belgian
style
beer
nicely
balanced
and
i
was
surprised
at
the
drinkabilty
given
the
9
5
alcohol
d
wellbalanced
belgianstyle
ipa
wishing
for
more
of
the
belgian
character
and
the
hops
might
have
faded
a
bit
its
been
in
my
fridge
for
5
months
or
so
otherwise
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
brew
pours
up
a
murky
rust
color
with
a
quickly
fading
off
white
head
the
nose
is
light
fruits
smoothed
out
hops
cork
slight
slight
sourness
as
this
bottle
might
be
juuust
starting
to
turn
i
taste
light

again
mellowed
floral
hops
pretty
buttery
mouthfeel
full
bodied
heavy
carbo
this
brew
may
be
6
months
to
a
year
past
its
prime
still
good
but
better
fresh
wish
i
could
find
this
even
in
bottle
form
overall
its
relatively
easy
pleasant
and
sufficiently
fulfilling
d
a
very
complex
and
drinkable
bipa
this
has
great
hop
character
and
while
the
belgian
yeast
character
might
be
a
little
weak
it
is
detectable
enough
to
mark
this
beer
as
something
other
than
an
american
dipa
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
bad
like
many
of
the
allagash
line
the
price
is
up
there
glad
i
was
able
to
sample
it
for
free
thanks
joe
im
not
so
sure
why
this
only
has
a
b
rating
thus
far
i
love
the
belgian
ipa
style
and
this
is
either
in
spot
1
or
2
for
me
highly
recommended
nice
job
allagash
drinkability
highly
drinkable
it
went
down
very
quickly
this
is
an
allaround
good
beer
the
hazy
chilled
golden
color
stood
out
against
the
sunset
a
slender
head
perched
atop
in
a
bone
white
the
nose
was
hoppy
peppery
fresh
and
had
hints
of
sharp
belgian
yeasty
citrus
notes
the
taste
was
sweet
and
hoppy
with
a
nice
creamsicle
like
flavor
that
i
associate
with
a
nice
belgian
tripel
the
mouthfeel
was
sharp
and
carbonated
but
not
too
thin
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
d
easy
drinking
especially
for
8
5
abv
given
its
classification
as
a
belgian
ipa
its
disappointing
the
hop
profile
was
so
subdued
that
i
would
have
never
guessed
this
was
a
belgian
ipa
if
i
didnt
no
otherwise
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
allagash
brews
but
i
keep
trying
new
ones
an
always
seem
to
walkaway
unimpressed
d
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
allagash
one
that
i
enjoyed
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
recommened
overall
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
another
homerun
from
allagash
if
avail
here
brought
this
back
from
indy
this
would
be
in
main
rotation
a
less
hoppy
but
nonetheless
quite
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
mouthfeel
is
firmly
carbonated
medium
bodied
just
a
bit
oily
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
for
sure
d
bought
this
by
accident
pretty
much
knew
what
to
expect
this
bitch
is
expensive
at
18
its
a
decent
beer
a
good
belgian
ipa
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
which
i
dont
consider
very
drinkable
but
was
able
to
slowly
begin
to
enjoy
this
brew
for
what
it
is
and
its
not
bad
definitely
a
hoppedup
belgian
brew
but
ill
need
to
try
a
few
others
to
see
if
the
resemblance
to
an
ipa
is
warranted
medium
bodied
great
vivacity
and
creamy
richness
envelop
the
palate
with
flavors
of
citrus
golden
malts
and
a
nice
smooth
bittering
with
some
spice
at
the
end
alcohol
comes
through
just
a
tad
strong
after
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
but
the
flavors
are
awesome
and
very
well
balanced
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
a
bastard
hybrid
between
an
american
northwest
ipa
and
a
belgian
golden
ale
and
this
one
hits
a
home
run
after
12
glass
i
began
to
enjoy
the
unique
flavor
personally
ive
never
tasted
anything
quite
like
this
which
made
it
a
great
experience
this
is
coming
from
someone
that
hasnt
found
an
allagash
brew
that
id
buy
again
but
im
pretty
sure
ive
only
tasted
a
few
also
if
someone
had
an
allagash
id
definitely
want
to
get
a
taste
i
get
a
very
well
balanced
beer
belgian
throughout
yet
most
intense
at
the
start
with
the
hops
the
hoppy
finish
is
necessary
and
not
overwhelming
great
head
retention
could
finish
fatter
is
a
little
thin
real
nice
flavor
on
the
tongue
as
the
beer
warms
from
the
bomber
at
room
temperature
into
a
pint
glass
this
one
gives
you
a
cloudy
copper
brown
color
with
a
solid
but
thin
offwhite
head
and
excellent
lacing
i
smell
easter
ham
here
with
clove
and
champagne
grape
the
first
taste
brings
more
of
that
champagne
feel
and
flavor
plenty
of
mellow
clove
and
some
malt
belgianesque
in
taste
and
feel
but
relatively
mellow
and
easy
drinking
i
like
it
as
a
nice
change
up
refreshing
and
kind
of
unique
drinkability
is
fairly
good
the
high
carbonation
does
detract
slightly
this
is
a
confusing
brew
its
labeled
here
as
a
belgian
ipa
but
the
description
on
the
brewerys
website
makes
it
sound
more
like
an
englishamerican
ipa
hybrid
and
the
taste
has
it
borrowing
from
all
three
ipa
types
it
leans
mostly
to
the
american
side
with
higher
still
too
high
belgian
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
yeasty
twang
yet
not
enough
hops
to
satisfy
any
of
the
three
still
if
you
ignore
the
label
it
remains
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
brew
especially
once
its
had
time
to
breathe
and
allow
the
carbonation
to
settle
belgian
style
bomber
caged
and
corked

bargain

i

aroma
advertises
a
great
beer
hoppy
peppery
some
pine
and
a
fragrant
sweet
belgian
yeastiness
flavor
does
not
carry
through
soapy
unbalanced
hops
with
that
medicinal
herbalness
perfect
call
swoopjones
the
crystal
malt
goes
very
well
with
the
yeast
however
dont
get
me
wrong
the
flavor
was
good
just
not
great
probably
could
have
been
better
without
the
dryhopping
d
this
is
a
very
good
very
complex
belgian
ipa
due
to
its
i
probably
wont
trade
for
it
again
but
will
have
it
again
if
i
see
it
in
stores
another
great
brew
by
allagash
that
i
was
impressed
with
good
one
i
again
show
myself
that
i
love
belgian
ipas
good
not
great
notes
from
11508
d
this
is
a
nice
balance
between
an
american
ipa
and
a
belgium
tripel
solid
candidate
for
a
session
beer
for
ale
lovers
allagash
hasnt
always
delivered
for
me
in
the
past
but
this
guy
is
something
i
would
like
to
revisit
allagash
sets
the
bar
high
with
their
interpretation
of
this
emerging
style
surprisingly
this
is
more
belgian
tasting
than
examples
ive
had
from
belgium
but
now
that
i
think
of
it
maybe
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
at
all
since
allagash
is
probably
the
best
maker
of
belgian
beers
outside
of
belgium
the
aroma
has
lots
of
hops
compared
to
most
belgians
its
also
got
malt
yeast
pepper
herbs
and
spice
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
foamy
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
its
pretty
good
i
am
just
not
sold
on
belgian
ipas
for
some
reason
hugh
malone
is
all
about
humulones
ordinarily
that
sort
of
focus
would
be
right
up
my
alley
however
a
wellcrafted
belgian
ipa
is
much
more
than
belgian
yeast
and
a
huge
hop
load
the
best
versions
urthel
hopit
de
ranke
xx
bitter
and
houblon
chouffe
dobbelen
ipa
tripel
have
absolutely
nothing
to
worry
about
mouthfeel
is
very
bubbly
and
finishes
mostly
dry
with
a
slight
residual
sweetness
like
honey
very
easy
to
drink
and
no
real
alcohol
presense
dont
know
much
about
it
except
that
it
cost
17
for
a
750ml
bottle
24
times
what
i
normally
buy
pours
a
medium
brown
color
very
murky
offtan
head
big
lasting
big
bubbles
good
lacing
very
effervescent
light
floral
aroma
not
as
dark
or
heavy
an
aroma
as
a
belgian
strong
also
theres
a
sharp
smell
not
quite
metallic
but
kind
of
plasticy
uh
oh
i
think
that
usually
means
something
bad
sharp
strong
taste
with
that
same
plasticy
but
more
dull
spicy
aftertaste
warming
up
some
more
not
as
plasticy
and
the
flavors
are
a
little
more
muted
spicy
somewhat
hoppy
not
too
dark
or
heavy
more
perfumy
floral
goes
well
with
salty
chips
salsa
tasty
beer
d
well
at
8
5
abv
the
envelope
is
maxed
out
i
can
see
pairing
this
with
fish
n
chips
maybe
some
raw
shell
fish
or
preferably
on
its
own
year
round
drinkability
is
ok
pretty
good
but
overpriced
even
with
the
dollar
a
bottle
going
to
charity
i
better
be
really
blown
away
by
the
07
interlude
i
just
tracked
down
for
a
25
in
wa
as
it
stands
this
one
has
a
bit
too
much
of
a
bite
on
both
the
taste
and
the
wallet
now
that
we
get
allagash
in
georgia
were
even
getting
the
special
releases
nice
frothy
head
fully
dimished
body
was
hazy
amber
aroma
light
bread
hay
and
straw
light
hoppiness
with
herb
and
grass
moderate
yeast
aswell
kind
of
smells
like
their
tripel
also
banana
and
apple
very
much
like
the
tripel
but
not
as
malty
or
yeasty
ok
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
i
had
not
realized
that
this
beer
was
a
hopforward
ale
im
glad
i
didnt
try
to
cellar
it
sacrificing
the
hop
character
in
regret
a
little
headsup
on
the
bottle
would
have
been
nice
having
said
that
the
hop
character
though
pronounced
doesnt
give
the
bitterness
or
the
hop
flavoraroma
that
classic
belgian
hoppy
beers
do
like
derank
xx
popperings
or
houblon
the
hops
are
tucked
in
right
behind
the
dubbel
or
belgian
amber
ale
maltiness
those
malts
are
very
well
attenuated
firm
soft
creamy
rich
and
never
leaves
any
residual
sugars
on
the
palate
confectionlike
sweetness
evaporates
in
the
mouth
and
makes
the
beer
increadibly
drinkable
fruity
rumsoaked
peaches
pears
berries
apples
and
appricots
give
the
beer
a
lot
of
direction
figs
pecans
and
dates
also
contribute
a
richness
that
go
along
with
a
light
maple
syrup
flavor
finishes
with
an
earthy
pungent
hopherbal
note
that
flirts
with
the
candied
malts
well
into
the
finish
an
excellent
beer
but
i
needed
a
lot
more
hop
flavor
aroma
and
bitterness
especially
if
american
variety
hops
are
used
d
pretty
good
enjoyed
this
beer
and
5th
earl
and
wouldve
had
another
but
decided
to
jet
as
the
gf
didnt
want
anything
else
would
drink
again
allagash
keeping
it
real
as
always
the
beer
poured
a
very
nice
cloudy
orangeish
color
with
a
big
white
head
no
doubt
due
to
the
carbonation
the
beer
gave
off
a
nice
hopy
aroma
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
maybe
a
little
pine
the
taste
was
excellent
at
first
i
really
got
all
of
the
hops
and
then
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
really
kicked
in
and
it
just
brought
the
whole
beer
together
the
beer
was
carbonated
just
right
and
it
was
very
smooth
rich
and
highly
drinkable
i
will
be
going
back
to
get
a
few
bottles
to
keep
around
this
may
become
a
staple
in
my
beer
fridge
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
courtesy
of
brickstoredave
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orangey
golden
with
an
okay
head
nice
aromas
of
piney
hops
and
some
malty
sweetness
as
well
as
the
typical
belgian
yeast
this
is
a
style
that
i
often
think
can
be
too
far
in
one
direction
or
the
other
but
his
manages
to
get
it
right
on
tap
its
is
very
nice
the
taste
is
even
more
on
point
with
piney
spicy
hops
some
mellow
sweetness
that
serves
to
underscore
the
hops
and
that
nice
yeasty
belgian
tang
a
tiny
bit
prickly
in
the
throat
but
with
a
touch
of
lingering
sweetness
to
counterbalance
this
just
delicious
on
tap
alcohol
what
alcohol
taste
of
fruits
touch
of
sweetness
some
metallicness
to
it
some
hops
and
caramel
in
the
back
slight
dry
finish
i
tasted
it
at
the
bottle
shop
at
pizza
port
in
carlsbad
ca
and
loved
every
drop
had
my
first
hugh
malone
last
weekend
at
the
great
lost
bear
in
portland
me
excellent
flavor
and
taste
definitely
different
than
a
typical
american
ipa
a
sweet
faintly
fruity
beer
poured
a
cloudy
dark
copper
color
with
a
nice
head
hard
to
describe
the
unique
flavor
someone
else
called
it
piney
which
is
about
as
good
a
description
as
i
can
think
of
dont
go
into
this
expecting
it
to
taste
like
every
other
ipa
youve
tried
its
got
its
own
taste
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
as
for
drinkability
you
do
notice
it
is
an
8
5
beer
and
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
would
be
tough
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
doesnt
want
to
be
just
one
kinda
beer
this
is
not
a
wild
or
adventurous
beer
but
its
a
great
unexpected
combination
that
works
really
well
which
makes
the
experience
special
mind
you
this
is
my
first
belgian
ipa
it
definitely
got
me
to
investigate
more
edit
9
27
09
im
editing
my
review
and
giving
this
beer
all
5s
i
cant
find
any
flaws
so
yeah
its
perfect
d
not
quite
a
belgian
ipa
but
still
a
good
beer
for
the
price
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
like
la
chouffe
ipa
dont
think
i
can
recommend
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
golden
amber
with
a
big
puffy
white
head
that
lasted
the
duration
of
the
session
and
left
very
good
lacing
the
smell
is
subdued
and
balanced
for
an
ipa
with
some
citrus
hops
but
a
significant
sweet
bready
malt
aroma
as
well
taste
is
also
heavy
with
sweet
malts
with
the
hops
playing
a
supporting
role
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
with
good
carbonation
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
crisp
and
clean
this
is
an
extremely
nice
beer
and
the
lowkey
hop
profile
makes
it
more
drinkable
than
the
alcohol
indicates
recommended
drinkability
despite
not
being
as
hoppy
as
expected
it
did
taste
very
good
and
i
thought
it
was
one
of
allagashs
better
special
releases
even
though
it
wasnt
truly
to
style
certainly
not
worth
the
14
99
price
tag
when
i
can
get
hop
to
it
which
is
better
for
under
10
pours
a
rusty
muddy
amber
wth
a
slow
recedng
head
and
very
hard
to
see
bubbling
through
the
thick
haze
the
color
looks
just
an
ipa
with
ome
more
haze
tan
usual
the
aroma
is
a
medium
sweet
biscuit
with
a
touch
of
honey
a
spicey
touch
of
hoppy
earth
the
tate
starts
with
the
sweet
biscuity
toasted
malts
with
notes
of
grains
of
pardise
andhoney
the
hops
lend
a
light
touch
of
lemon
and
some
pine
forest
the
palate
is
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
the
finish
is
long
and
mildly
bitter
great
beer
worth
buying
again
and
again
over
all
this
is
a
nice
beer
great
packaging
and
nice
little
note
about
donating
a
buck
a
bottle
to
community
groups
in
maine
but
in
the
end
its
nothing
that
blew
me
away
and
i
can
only
look
forward
to
seeing
what
this
guy
has
in
store
next
july
13th
decent
body
and
seriously
carbonated
all
in
all
i
would
say
this
beer
is
interesting
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
though
a
far
cry
from
the
curieux
that
i
cant
get
enough
of
overall
this
beer
swings
more
towards
the
belgian
side
of
the
coin
and
that
is
not
my
bag
it
was
a
solid
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
belgians
just
are
not
my
thing
d
good
nice
spiciness
and
goes
down
nicely
get
a
bottle
and
support
mofga
today
although
the
hops
have
faded
quite
a
bit
compared
to
when
it
was
fresh
this
was
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
remember
it
being
a
good
interpretation
of
a
belgian
ipa
when
i
had
it
last
summer
and
it
was
interesting
to
see
how
this
developed
with
almost
a
year
in
the
cellar
it
has
a
belgianesque
sweet
and
sour
going
on
but
falls
short
of
a
really
good
bipa
more
hops
please
still
its
pretty
drinkable
and
pretty
good
though
not
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
750ml
corked
caged
and
what
on
earth
is
a
belgian
ipa
i
suppose
i
bought
this
one
to
find
out
it
hits
the
glass
murky
golden
tan
with
a
thin
but
determined
light
tan
head
and
a
hint
of
lace
the
smell
is
honey
coriander
caramel
seems
more
belgian
than
ipa
so
far
the
taste
is
floral
caramel
peppery
with
an
element
of
mown
grass
and
a
very
dry
finish
very
odd
mix
it
grows
on
me
though
the
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
silky
with
nice
carbonation
balance
drinkability
is
good
enough
to
polish
off
the
bottle
probably
wont
enter
the
regular
rotation
but
definitely
an
experience
to
have
750
ml
bottle
cellar
aged
for
a
year
poured
into
a
goblet
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
clear
amber
color
grapefruit
banana
and
pine
aroma
soft
round
flavor
with
hints
of
banana
and
a
slight
malt
sweetness
medium
body
and
high
drinkability
for
this
8
5
brew
thanks
steven
d
pretty
good
for
8
5
its
smooth
enough
and
intriguing
but
ultimately
i
didnt
feel
like
this
was
one
of
allagashs
best
efforts
at
15
bucks
a
bottle
you
can
do
better
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
dirt
brown
color
with
a
good
offwhite
head
that
left
some
nice
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
some
what
faint
i
pick
up
some
granny
smith
apple
lemon
and
very
light
spice
the
taste
is
light
bready
malt
tart
apples
and
some
dry
bittering
hops
not
much
in
the
way
of
belgian
phenols
or
candi
sugar
it
is
almost
hard
to
detect
the
belgian
style
the
hops
dont
really
standout
either
the
feel
is
moderate
and
quite
fizzy
a
bit
over
carbonated
actually
the
finish
is
dry
almost
puckering
the
beer
isnt
bad
but
i
believe
it
missed
its
mark
as
a
belgian
ipa
not
enough
belgian
flavors
and
the
hops
dont
standout
seems
to
be
more
malty
than
other
bipas
perhaps
this
is
the
reason
tastes
of
fruits
spices
sweet
malt
and
citric
hops
laid
back
though
the
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
thin
and
over
carbonated
imo
750ml
bottle
this
one
opened
with
a
loud
pop
but
fortunately
there
was
no
spillage
it
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
to
it
it
leaves
some
lacing
down
the
glass
there
is
a
bready
spicy
and
yeasty
nose
to
the
beer
as
well
as
some
citrus
mainly
grapefruit
and
pine
also
an
interesting
taste
some
breadiness
and
yeastiness
to
it
with
a
hint
of
apricots
in
there
there
is
a
hint
of
sweetness
despite
the
hop
presence
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
yet
there
is
still
a
perception
of
lightness
to
it
this
definitely
grows
on
you
i
like
this
beer
it
grows
on
you
as
it
warms
up
in
my
opinion
i
am
halfway
through
the
bottle
and
i
prefer
it
much
more
now
than
at
first
sip
its
a
relatively
light
although
not
in
abv
its
8
5
and
easydrinking
ale
smoother
as
it
warms
up
with
more
discernable
belgian
ipa
qualities
slowly
emerging
give
it
a
try
its
worth
it
pours
a
clear
fairly
dark
brown
with
a
good
sized
crème
head
nose
is
very
sugary
sweet
like
candy
or
even
cotton
candy
and
a
good
amount
of
wood
mixed
in
there
as
well
flavor
is
mild
slight
hops
pretty
big
sweetness
going
on
besides
that
maybe
a
little
wood
small
amount
of
spices
feel
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
it
but
i
have
to
say
i
think
the
liquid
is
a
bit
too
thin
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
for
the
price
hell
no
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
i
have
wanted
to
take
back
and
get
a
refund
16
99
are
you
joking
16
99
for
what
dont
bother
nicely
done
ipa
i
thought
it
was
an
irish
dry
and
yet
it
wasnt
overly
dry
yeasty
and
a
body
to
it
some
interesting
calmer
ipa
even
british
style
ipa
with
a
cloudy
peachy
colour
and
some
white
head
fruity
hoppy
malty
aroma
a
bit
dry
finish
otherwise
nicely
done
hoppy
ale
so
overall
the
beer
was
good
but
for
the
price
13
99
ive
had
beers
for
12
the
price
that
ive
enjoyed
much
more
i
like
allagash
beers
in
general
but
this
isnt
near
the
top
of
their
best
products
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
probably
suffer
from
it
at
first
glance
you
think
nah
cant
be
is
allagash
brewing
an
ale
in
a
funky
750ml
bottle
well
its
true
another
belgium
for
the
library
this
ale
has
that
belgium
character
but
hey
wait
a
minute
its
not
as
strong
as
some
others
ive
had
but
it
has
a
great
balance
of
sweetness
and
even
tier
of
abv
sitting
at
8
5
with
cloudyness
the
chemicals
swish
and
swoosh
around
in
the
mouth
and
it
lingers
enough
for
that
flavorful
aroma
it
makes
yah
respect
the
belgium
style
that
allagash
has
done
over
the
years
its
nice
maybe
could
use
a
little
hoppy
drive
have
it
over
dinner
and
experiment
jc
bottle
poured
a
mahogany
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
some
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
some
dry
with
some
dry
czech
hops
taste
is
also
dominated
by
those
sweet
malt
with
limited
dry
fruits
characteristics
or
oak
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
some
great
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
was
noticeable
d
an
interesting
offering
but
not
something
that
i
would
rank
too
highly
because
of
the
offthewall
flavor
characteristics
the
belgian
ipa
is
a
style
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
but
what
i
have
sampled
ive
enjoyed
this
one
seems
to
miss
the
mark
somewhat
but
would
still
be
worth
a
try
interesting
but
unfortunately
not
very
drinkable
if
laid
down
for
a
year
or
more
it
might
lose
enough
of
the
hop
edge
to
be
tasty
pretty
drinkable
but
you
have
to
think
belgian
beer
and
not
really
ipa
still
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
belgian
style
strong
pale
ale
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
fruity
pale
malt
and
belgian
yeast
aroma
there
is
a
light
hop
aroma
that
seems
to
blend
nicely
with
the
spiciness
of
the
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
warm
pale
malt
flavor
along
with
a
very
spicey
yeast
finish
the
hops
are
present
but
they
take
a
backseat
to
the
belgian
pale
ale
flavor
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
that
really
reveals
itself
in
the
finish
but
im
not
that
impressed
with
it
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
flop
by
allagash
ive
had
hybris
style
beers
like
this
before
but
this
one
falls
flat
i
like
the
idea
but
the
execution
lacks
i
prefer
more
ipa
character
this
tastes
like
a
saison
yeast
its
quite
peppery
they
should
use
a
less
aggressive
yeast
to
highlight
the
hop
profile
imo
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
has
good
retention
the
aroma
is
slightly
earthy
and
has
a
hint
of
alcohol
to
go
along
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
along
with
some
spices
there
is
also
a
strong
caramel
malt
profile
and
some
fruit
character
the
body
seems
moderate
but
a
little
more
thin
than
i
expected
the
drinkability
is
just
ok
as
the
spices
and
the
alcohol
present
them
readily
in
the
flavor
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
as
it
has
a
lot
of
character
but
i
dont
know
that
its
one
id
seek
out
again
unless
its
much
older
not
a
bad
beer
but
as
most
of
the
reviewers
so
aptly
stated
it
is
definitely
overpriced
16
dollars
for
a
750ml
is
steep
for
a
beer
yes
the
cork
and
casing
are
cool
but
it
ends
there
the
beer
is
a
well
carbonated
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
very
nice
off
white
head
that
retains
and
retains
there
is
a
goodly
amount
of
lacing
too
the
carbonation
doesnt
quit
with
the
little
fizzy
bubbles
streaming
to
the
top
well
after
the
pour
the
smell
is
very
subdued
and
not
very
enticing
i
little
more
dry
hopping
could
have
brought
something
out
in
this
department
but
alas
no
and
what
you
get
are
some
very
subtle
sweet
malts
candied
sugars
some
alcohol
notes
and
maybe
some
fruits
it
smells
like
a
weak
trippel
or
belgian
blonde
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
again
medium
bodied
creamy
consistency
a
little
pepperish
snap
in
there
but
it
fades
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
a
malty
caramel
flavor
more
than
anything
else
that
i
detect
there
might
be
some
currant
flavors
but
they
are
pretty
far
down
on
the
tasteometer
there
is
a
slightly
lingering
aftertaste
but
not
from
the
hops
more
from
the
candied
sugars
and
the
yeasts
if
you
let
it
hang
on
the
tongue
for
awhile
you
might
get
some
pine
resin
hoppiness
but
you
have
to
really
search
for
it
not
a
bad
beer
one
i
would
drink
again
but
why
is
this
one
priced
so
high
overall
this
beer
isnt
the
hoppiest
belgian
ipa
that
ive
had
nor
is
it
particularly
hoppy
the
hops
are
noticeable
but
are
dominated
by
the
fruity
characteristics
despite
this
im
giving
the
beer
high
marks
because
its
very
enjoyable
even
though
the
name
may
be
a
misnomer
drinkability
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
quaff
big
beer
this
is
why
allagash
is
a
brewery
that
i
respect
great
flavors
and
easy
drinking
i
think
that
a
lot
of
the
fruitiness
of
this
beer
comes
from
the
hops
interestingly
enough
the
simcoe
does
not
taste
as
it
does
in
an
ipa
some
how
it
is
much
greener
not
nearly
as
citruslike
though
that
is
here
and
quite
herbaceous
i
am
curios
if
a
belgiantype
yeast
strain
was
used
here
there
are
definitely
some
phenolics
higher
alcohols
that
could
be
attributed
to
this
or
it
could
be
some
combination
of
warmer
fermentation
temperatures
alcohol
and
green
hop
notes
though
i
wouldnt
guess
so
this
is
certainly
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
i
was
expecting
given
the
description
on
the
bottle
but
it
is
still
a
nice
beer
that
has
some
really
interesting
flavors
the
woodlike
almost
bourbon
notes
are
really
interesting
considering
neither
of
those
were
involved
in
the
making
of
this
beer
while
drinkable
even
enjoyable
this
beer
in
the
end
is
a
bit
too
harsh
hot
and
not
all
that
well
integrated
i
am
not
sure
what
happened
here
but
allagash
can
definitely
do
better
nice
body
and
carbonation
pretty
clean
and
crisp
i
would
happily
drink
this
if
offered
it
in
a
vacuum
but
otherwise
im
disappointed
drinkability
a
beer
very
unbefitting
of
its
pricetag
hazy

good
stuff
who
is
hugh
malone
was
he
a
bartender
on
cheers
nah
im
kidding
i
could
google
him
but
id
rather
just
drink
the
beer
the
interplay
between
hops
and
spicy
esters
forms
a
blended
skirmish
that
plays
out
enjoyably
the
abv
is
plenty
piggy
but
it
doesnt
dampen
the
pleasing
drinkable
nature

the

made
up

thanks
stan
wow
i
did
not
even
look
this
up
or
know
what
to
expect
when
going
in
which
is
the
way
i
prefer
to
try
new
beers
i
figured
another
allagash
tripel
maybe
with
a
twist
poured
a
very
hazy
amber
yellow
with
a
huge
three
inch
plus
head
of
white
foam
this
reluctantly
faded
after
a
few
minutes
and
left
behind
copious
amounts
of
lace
down
the
glass
lots
of
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
hoppy
which
quite
shocked
me
at
first
there
was
the
underlying
base
of
yeast
and
your
typical
tripel
smell
but
above
that
was
this
huge
aroma
of
citrus
hops
lots
of
orange
peel
and
sweet
tangerine
aromas
now
this
is
what
im
talking
about
the
taste
was
superb
lots
of
west
coast
hops
in
the
back
well
forst
great
feel
smooth
light
and
great
carbonation
went
down
real
easy
and
had
the
slightly
fizzy
feel
that
really
makes
the
flavors
pop
nice
bread
and
yeast
tones
earthy
grains
made
up
the
backbone
of
this
one
then
interwovern
were
extremly
frsh
cut
hops
very
nice
orange
and
grapefruit
tones
very
upfront
too
the
mixture
of
these
gave
it
a
very
unique
flavor
i
had
not
seen
before
i
actually
enjoyed
this
much
more
then
the
other
belgian
ipa
i
have
tried
i
felt
there
was
much
more
hoppiness
to
this
one
overall
this
was
a
great
great
beer
i
could
easily
see
myself
purchasing
this
again
however
at
15
99
a
bottle
not
too
often
but
if
you
are
gonna
splurge
this
is
definatly
worth
a
try
the
first
smell
is
a
little
phenolic
and
medicinal
the
head
is
creamy
looking
beer
is
reddish
and
cloudy
in
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
streaming
towards
the
top
of
the
chalice
the
taste
is
odd
and
slightly
harsh
my
novice
palate
cannot
seem
to
detect
a
hint
of
the
simcoes
used
in
this
beer
or
any
hops
for
that
matter
once
this
beer
starts
to
approach
room
temperature
it
gets
much
better
the
beer
starts
to
exhibit
hoppy
qualities
contradicting
my
previous
statements
and
is
actually
pretty
good
but
i
still
dont
know
how
my
amateur
palate
feels
about
this
belgian
ipa
thing
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
i
will
try
other
allagash
beers
since
this
was
my
first
i
think
i
got
a
really
good
deal
because
this
only
cost
me
8
99
and
i
think
it
is
supposed
to
retail
for
around
15
one
thing
i
do
love
about
this
beer
is
the
name
great
combination
of
the
history
of
a
great
brewer
and
a
play
on
words
for
cohumulone
i
also
think
its
really
cool
that
allagash
is
donating
a
dollar
from
each
bottle
to
teach
others
the
benefits
of
organic
farming
somewhat
muted
orange
color
huge
off
white
head
that
dissapates
rather
quickly
lactic
and
somewhat
solvent
like
aroma
quite
yeasty
very
malty
flavor
with
a
breadyyeasty
quality
sizeable
hop
presence
but
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
decent
enough
body
overall
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
from
the
card
i
read
on
the
shelf
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
hop
presence
a
notch
above
average
urthel
hopit
blows
this
away
certainly
not
within
the
realm
of
ipa
but
tasty
nonetheless
a
14
99
750ml
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
with
an
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
i
can
smell
hops
and
a
little
citrus
if
i
try
really
hard
but
mostly
i
smell
yeasty
bready
typical
good
tripel
smell
tastes
the
same
kind
of
like
a
good
old
tripel
belgian
style
beer
with
just
a
little
hop
and
malt
finish
no
doubt
a
decent
brew
but
i
felt
a
little
misled
by
what
id
been
told
by
the
brewery
about
what
to
expect
oh
well
its
cool
that
allagash
is
donating
1
for
every
bottle
sold
to
a
foundation
that
educates
farmers
in
maine
about
organic
farming
but
i
feel
violated
on
this
one
sorry
rob
d
very
rich
and
hoppy
definitely
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
who
love
hops
and
belgian
beers
drinkability
very
good
paired
well
with
the
seafood
shishkabobs
i
was
having
d
the
abv
is
a
little
high
to
make
this
a
goto
but
allagash
has
managed
to
create
another
winner
once
again
a
belgian
inspired
beer
that
also
attempts
to
include
an
american
hop
component
i
havent
tasted
a
one
yet
that
delivered
on
the
hype
poured
a
dark
dull
amber
with
a
flat
aroma
of
yeast
and
dusty
sweet
malt
tasted
yeasty
with
a
little
burnt
sugar
and
for
a
brief
fleeting
moment
i
caught
a
hint
of
those
ballyhooed
hops
then
they
were
gone
sharp
piercing
carbonation
and
a
kinda
foamylike
mouth
feel
i
just
dont
like
reading
a
brewery
sellsheet
about
how
they
get
all
jiggy
with
various
hopping
innovations
and
acclaimed
varietals
only
to
come
up
with
something
that
tastes
like
a
mediocre
tripel
it
makes
me
feel
misled
especially
when
you
pay
15
dollars
for
a
bottle
of
it
an
interesting
beer
but
overall
id
say
its
a
swing
and
a
miss
though
a
good
effort
its
clear
some
thought
went
into
this
the
fruit
dominates
throughout
with
a
decent
alcohol
warming
sensation
in
the
finish
as
well
as
some
herbaceousness
which
may
be
the
hops
peeking
through
though
they
have
no
bittering
to
speak
of
an
enjoyable
though
odd
theres
that
word
again
offering
from
allagash
im
relatively
new
to
this
style
so
im
not
sure
if
this
is
what
they
were
going
for
or
not
a
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
was
a
cloudy
redorange
color
with
a
thin
head
it
smelled
like
an
ipa
floral
and
piney
there
was
a
honey
background
to
the
aroma
however
the
first
sip
resembled
a
tripel
but
then
the
pine
and
citrus
hops
kicked
in
and
they
lingered
for
a
while
very
enjoyable
ill
have
to
try
more
of
these
belgian
ipas
pours
a
cloudy
carmelhoney
color
with
a
giant
tan
foamy
headand
i
do
mean
giant
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
carbonationso
be
careful
when
pouring
the
smell
is
lighter
than
i
expectedbut
i
could
make
out
sweet
malt
and
some
hops
the
taste
has
a
real
fruity
flavor
to
itlemonwoodycorrianderand
pine
hops
are
the
most
dominate
flavors
the
mf
is
light
with
the
flavors
mixing
pretty
well
not
a
bad
beerbut
i
expected
more
from
allagash
and
it
was
19
99
a
bottle
so
what
are
they
charging
for
a
bottle
what
pours
a
bright
dark
amber
with
a
grapefruit
pinkishred
tinge
and
a
soft
dusty
head
covering
the
liquid
wonderful
nose
of
caramel
malts
touched
by
belgian
fruit
esters
overlaid
by
the
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
of
simcoe
hops
its
a
truly
lovely
nose
a
hybrid
between
an
esb
and
a
belgian
ipa
on
the
palate
its
surprisingly
light
and
quite
citrusy
with
a
metallic
edge
thats
pure
hops
light
graham
cracker
malts
form
the
backbone
for
the
beer
big
sweetness
first
off
featuring
those
lightly
caramelly
malts
but
the
hops
present
themselves
throughout
with
that
simcoe
sweet
tropical
fruit
flavors
with
underlying
bitterness
character
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
with
carbonation
almost
overly
so
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
alcoholic
burn
overall
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
ipa
the
simcoe
hops
provide
for
some
very
soft
bitterness
which
goes
very
well
with
the
belgian
style
malts
and
overall
lesser
emphasis
on
hop
bitterness
quite
the
entertaining
and
beguiling
complex
brew
yum
the
beer
pours
a
very
nice
amber
brown
color
with
decent
head
and
lacing
not
a
lot
in
the
nose
maybe
some
spice
and
citrus
on
the
palate
the
beer
tastes
like
your
rather
typical
belgium
brown
ale
with
a
bit
more
hoppiness
then
normal
this
was
a
nice
enough
beer
but
i
have
to
say
it
seemed
a
bit
simple
and
one
dimensional
i
am
surprised
to
see
it
characterized
as
a
belgium
ipa
as
the
hops
were
not
very
noticeable
and
there
was
very
little
hoppy
citrus
flavor
nevertheless
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
probably
not
one
ill
order
again
any
time
soon
good
but
the
8
5
abv
is
present
pours
a
very
murky
orange
color
with
a
medium
head
of
tanoff
white
bubbles
aroma
is
very
yeasty
and
bready
with
only
a
hint
of
citrus
and
pineapple
taste
is
a
bit
oaky
is
this
barrel
aged
yeast
dominates
the
flavor
profile
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
homebrew

still
give

nice

more

tropical
hops
could
have
made
this

sticking

style

still
makes
this
one
heck
of
a
brew
overall
good
brew
honestly
i
will
buy
it
again
which
is

favorite
classics

sweet
thoughme
personally
would
like
more
big
brash
hops
but
its
not
bad
sweet
and
delicious
not
as
hoppy
as
i
was
expecting
with
the
triple

shared
with
the

bite
yeasties
basically
like
regular
piraat
with
a
slight
but
more
bite
medium
bodied
with
medium
plus
carbonation
overall
pretty
solid
whats
with
the
low
score
here
pretty
much
just
like
the
regular
version
but
a
bit
lighter
on
the
palate
with
the
hop
additions
its
literally
a
hoppier
piraat
that
means
its
just
as
good
as
regular
piraat
but
with
more
hops
if
you
think
that
sounds
good
youll
like
it
otherwise
you
probably
wont
id
personally
take
regular
piraat
over
this
but
at
the
same
time
this
is
quite
good
and
worth
trying
a
crazily
offkilter
beast
this
one
is
more
tripellike
in
its
base
malt
yeast
and
alcohol
bearing
before
the
anemic
attempt
at
hopping
it
up
even
has
a
chance
to
underwhelm
too
hot
and
throat
aggrieving
to
really
recommend
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
its
listed
as
a
belgian
ipa
but
really
different
from
others
in
this
style
ive
had
strong
somewhat

like
a
strong

many
ways

and
drank

this
was
really
good
the
hop
character
came
through
really
well
nice
apple
and
pepper
notes
in
the
nose
earthy
in
the
taste
with
some
malt
breaking
through
the
hops
hops
make
up
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
noticed
but
pretty
well
masked
here
really
good
beer
overall
a
great
interpretation
of
the
original
piraat
with
a
bit
more
hops
no
distinguishable
hop
aroma
at
all
could
smell
only
the
alcohol
taste
follows
the
nose
with
nothing
but
alcohol
one
of
the
booziest
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
couldnt
even
finish
it
overall
a
very
good
twist
on
the
piraat
ale
the
added
hops
arent
overpowering
but
add
a
nice
juicy
and
floral
kick
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
a
regular
piraat
so
i
at
least
expected
a
wave
of
hops
im
not
sure
if
it
arrived
but
i
will
say
that
this
is
one
enjoyable
beer
overall
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
it
just
misses
the
mark
tone
the
alcohol
down
a
bit
and
there
might
really
be
something
here
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a

not
much
herbal
hop
flavor
but
the
dry
hopping
is
apparent
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
nice
sharp
carbonation
piraat
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
belgain
ales
and
i
was
uncertain
how
i
would
like
this
hopped
version
no
concerns
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
belgian
base
ale
the
hops
and
the
traditional
belgian
spices
alcohol
is
surprisingly
well
covered
i
will
be
drinking
this
happily
along
side
the
regular
piraat
whenever
it
shows
up
o
im
guessing
im
drinking
the
second
release
of
this
ale
as
my
label
is
green
not
yellow
and
it
says
dry
hopped
ale
on
the
label
either
that
or
im
getting
the
us
version
of
it
real
good
stuff
retains
some
distinctive
piraat
flavors
and
aromas
features
the
following
hops
saaz
tetra
and
aurora
with
cascade
for
the
dry
hopping
fans
of
belgian
pales
and
ales
in
general
will
probably
be
pleased
an
interesting
if
not
superior
take
on
piraat
recommended
o
flavorful
and
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
abv
i
thought
this
was
balanced
and
well
executed
a
great
alternative
to
the
original
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
albeit
a
strong
one
id
recommend
trying
it
but
it
might
be
best
to
do
so
with
a
friend
its
onward
trek
toward
closure
turns
the
beer
bitingly
bitter
and
bracingly
spicy
while
its
carbonation
is
tempered
buffed
out
by
the
ordinate
residual
sweetness
that
lingers
on
hedging
on
fusal
taste
its
numbing
prickle
is
needed
to
slice
through
its
honey
liquor
aftertaste
and
texture
o
a
solidly
done
very
tasty
beer
definitely
drinkable
and
likeable
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
even
though
i
have
a
semitired
palate
from
belgian
beers
been
drinking
them
for
way
too
many
years
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
in
a
long
time
alcohol
could
be
hidden
a
little
better
but
still
a
nice
sipping
beer

not
as
big
and
bold
as
i
would
have
suspected
but
still
pretty
darn
good
pours
a
deep
dark

that
dissipates
down
to
an
oily
sheen
rich
aroma

dried

dark

taste

i
would
expect
but
still
a
good
belgian
nonetheless
the
toasted
biscuit
malts
and
fruit
flavors
are
there
but
muted
due
to
the
earthy
hop
character
that
roars
in
from
the
background
it

dry

a
bitter
memorable

alcohol
well
integrated
but
i
felt
it
by
the
time
i
finished
writing
this
review
o
great
great
beer
is
it
so
rare
that
nobody
rates
this
one
try
it
my
topper
of
2013
nice
moderate
carbonation
its
still
a
very
good
beer
but
i
had
hoped
for
more
of
the
ipa
goodness
i
was
thinking
initially
that
the
hops
were
winning
this
particular
battle
the
fruity
and
spicy
yeast
is
making
a
late
resurgence
though
as
was
the
case
for
the
red
ale
genre
deschutes
absolutely
kills
this
style
space
and
this
one
goes
down
as
a
personal
favorite
belgian
ipa
just
not
my
cup
o
tea
a
solid
ipa
which
looks
great
smells
good
has
a
strong
flavour
and
is
refreshing
however
its
bitterness
may
be
a
tad
strong
for
some
and
the
fruit
flavours
are
more
subdued
than
youd
expect
from
the
aromas
still
a
great
brew
overall
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
3
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
excellent
has
a
fresh
lemon
aroma
i
can
detect
grapefruit
and
small
amount
of
resin
as
well
malty
up
front
followed
by
a
strong
lemon
burst
of
a
hop
very
tart
there
may
be
some
grapefruit
thrown
in
but
there
is
mainly
a
lemon
tart
aftertaste
very
bitter
not
sure
what
to
make
of
the
lemon
tartness
of
it
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
belgian
flavor
either
it
is
good
but
different
probably
couldnt
drink
much
of
this
beer
in
1
sitting
there
is
something
wrong
here
the
interplay
between
yeast
and
hops
is
astringent
like
some
sort
of
abrasive
counter
cleaner
its
got
a
nasty
bitter
lemon
peel
thing
with
no
body
too
bad
it
is
really
pretty
beautiful
fluffy
white
head
and
a
floral
bouquet
to
go
with
it
smooth
taste
and
hops
are
dominant
but
pleasant
nice
offering
for
a
belgian
ipa
light
and
refreshing
citrus
the
balance
of
flavor
and
carbonation
were
very
good
nice
white
foam
at
the
top
overall
this
is
a
rather
nice
crisp
belgian
style
ipa
quite
refreshing
and
delicious
flavours
include
more
spicy
hops
with
some
phenolic
notes
derived
from
the
yeast
some
soft
booze
in
the
finish
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
very
good
somewhat
golden
in
color
with
a
good
persistent
head
i
was
expecting
the
belgian
style
yeast
to
dominate
but
instead
both
the
taste
and
smell
were
a
good
combination
of
fruity
hops
and
rich
malt
flavor
with
the
yeast
working
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
the
finish
good
im
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
try
deschutes
seems
to
have
played
it
safe
on
this
one
by
creating
what
tastes
more
like
a
belgianinfluenced
ipa
than
a
belgian
ipa
and
it
works
the
nonaggressive
belgian
yeast
works
well
with
the
fruity
floral
hop
profile
worth
drinking
again
i
thought
that
this
was
very
similar
to
zombie
dust
o
if
only
this
beer
tasted
like
it
smells
the
nose
is
wonderful
complex
just
what
im
looking
for
in
a
belgian
ipa
the
flavor
isnt
nearly
as
complex
but
i
still
like
it
they
really
fell
short
on
the
mouthfeelwhat
could
be
smooth
bready
and
juicy
is
very
dry
and
overcarbonated
it
smells
wonderful
and
the
taste
is
good
too
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
style
a
refreshing
and
tasty
brew
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
the
beer
was
neither
lacking
nor
full
of
character
it
had
a
good
balance
to
it
admittedly
i
dont
yet
fully
get
belgian
ipas
have
had
quite
a
few
but
not
a
ton
so
far
the
style
never
seems
to
quite
engage
me
but
never
disappoints
per
say
either
id
like
to
get
a
few
together
to
compare
at
the
same
time
this
one
was
solid
o
its
a
subtle
ipa
and
subtle
on
the
belgian
yeast
not
a
top
in
style
but
good
overall
almost
like
an
ipa
with
just
a
little
distraction
to
remind
you
its
a
belgian
ipa
wonder
if
this
was
properly
stored
if
only
i
knew
when
it
was
bottled
rather
than
best
by
date
it
might
have
been
better
if
i
purchased
this
outside
of
utah
state
liquor
stores
do
not
refrigerate
beers
strong
feel
it
after
a
few
great
bitter
after
taste
i
found
this
to
be
very
enjoyable
its
barely
an
ipa
its
highly
drinkable
and
crazy
mellow
and
subtle
just
is
a
deschutes
beer
and
thats
good
enough
for
me
foray
pours
a
medium
yellow
with
a
medium
foam
head
that
dissipates
in
a
few
minutes
it
leaves
a
light
laceing
as
it
is
consumed
it
had
a
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
the
taste
to
me
remained
fairly
consistent
over
the
45
minutes
or
so
it
took
to
drink
it
the
label
suggests
that
it
delivers
hints
of
apple
and
pear
i
never
really
got
the
hint
i
did
however
taste
bits
of
citrus
and
a
light
pepper
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
like
ipas
and
belgium
brews
and
this
was
neither
way
hoppy
nor
unhoppy
so
to
speak
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
for
sure
deschutes
comes
thru
again

initial
taste
of
what
is
it
pineapple
orange
ahhh
lemon
what
this
lacks
is
grapefruit
so
many
other
ipas
have
grapefruit
you
expect
to
taste
gf
but
no
peppery
aftertaste
and
the
head
still
clings
the
lightest
mouthfeel
you
will
ever
experience
overall
an
ipa
that
is
not
like
any
other
is
that
good
or
bad
you
decide
as

some

the

is

some

deschutes
does
not
make
bad
beer
this
is
just
another
rock
solid
offering
and
a
pretty
good
bargain
given
the
price
point
medium
body
the
above
average
carbonation
is
a
little
harsh
for
the
style
overall
a
very
nice
ipa
lacks
malt
balance
but
a
full
flavored
citrus
beverage
otasty
sweet
and
drinkable
reminds
me
a
little
of
chainbreaker
an
easy
drinking
brew
overall
a
very
good
buy
for
just
6
bucks
for
the
bomber
try
it
the
taste
is
sweettart
with
a
dry
finish
malty
and
a
slight
yeast
phenols
come
through
some
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
it
finishes
a
bit
gritty
a
pretty
desent

super

not
overly
belgian
but
enjoyable

brilliant
golden
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
amarillo
hops
very
dry
finish
slightly
piney
its
more
bitter
than
i
prefer
good
belgian
yeast
ester
character
though
nice
hoppy
finish
not
overwhelming
serving
type
bottle
trailing
dry
lightbodied
and
deeply
resinous
its
fastfleeting
finish
leaves
a
fresh
grassy
piney
and
juniper
character
attached
to
its
long
lingering
bitterness
refreshing
crisp
and
clean
its
quite
clear
that
the
belgian
aspects
of
the
ale
act
in
a
supporting
role
and
lets
the
hops
take
center
stage
very
nice
beer
especially
for
the
relatively
low
alcohol
not
sure
what
bottles
are
like
but
on
tap
this
was
a
fairly
dry
lightly
bitter
well
spiced
version
of
a
belgian
ipa
that
was
quite
easy
to
take
overall
just
another
great
beer
from
another
great
brewery
so
good
slight
mango
in
the
finish
definitely
taste
the
belgian
style
but
its
a
fresh
unique
beer
i
loved
it
id
love
to
get
a
six
pack
of
this
instead
of
a
22oz
which
was
my
only
option
deschutes
can
do
no
wrong
would
pair
well
with
chicken
salad
andor
white
fish
it
pours
almost
a
neon
yellow
color
and
slightly
hazy
aromas
of
apple
and
pear
hit
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
banana
the
hops
are
very
gentle
here
but
strong
enough
to
twist
the
yeast
to
an
awesome
cooperation
it
tastes
bright
and
fresh
with
citrus
and
fresh
cut
grass
overall
i
think
this
is
awesome
a
mixing
of
styles
thoughtfully
done
to
complement
one
another
another
excellent
brew
from
deschutes
enjoyed
in
the
new
belgium
snifter
and
poured
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
the
market
in
anacortes
mouthfeel
is
medium
somewhat
dry
overall
not
bad
mostly
just
not
my
style
o
yet
another
delicious
ipa
from
deschutes
definitely
recommended
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
bitter
enough
or
hoppy
enough
to
really
be
a
belgian
ipa
o
a
nice
ipa
that
was
clean
and
easy
to
drink
hops
were
exceptionally
juicy
definitely
a
citrus
bomb
and
not
overly
belgian
deschutes
can
do
no
wrong
and
while
they
may
have
overexploited
their
talent
with
the
citrusy
hop
varietals
in
a
lot
of
beers
with
similar
hop
complexions
it
really
never
gets
old
for
me
and
this
is
another
awesome
brew
from
them
really
pale
blonde
in
color
mostly
clear
and
sporting
a
luxurious
pillowy
white
head
with
nice
airy
lace
that
gets
more
elaborate
with
each
sip
the
nose
is
all
citra
for
me
maybe
a
little
leafy
greenness
to
it
but
its
real
fresh
and
clean
not
dissimilar
to
the
fresh
squeezed
hop
profile
but
much
much
lighter
in
the
grain
bill
in
both
color
and
body
almost
pilseneresque
like
a
belgian
yeast
lagunitas
day
time
or
something
similar
the
hops
are
definitely
close
the
flavor
is
really
clean
too
wight
he
malt
being
really
delicate
up
front
and
although
the
hops
are
heavy
handed
in
this
beer
they
arent
sticky
or
bitter
so
the
beer
drinks
awfully
easy
the
other
thing
i
dig
about
it
is
that
the
belgian
part
is
secondary
its
minimally
belgian
yeasty
not
dominated
by
the
fruity
high
notes
which
allows
the
hops
to
do
their
thing
an
appropriate
focus
so
many
belgian
india
pales
get
lost
in
their
yeast
this
one
doesnt
its
accent
flavors
of
green
apple
and
even
green
chestnut
its
real
cool
real
subtle
and
overall
an
exceptional
bottle
of
ale
especially
at
5
bucks
a
bomber
great
carbonation
and
supremely
refreshing
love
it
overall
i
was
skeptical
when
this
was
coming
out
because
of
deschutes
chainbreaker
which
seems
to
be
in
a
similar
wheelhouse
as
this
one
stylistically
however
theyve
done
a
great
job
of
separating
the
two
beers
and
ended
up
with
two
ipas
that
harken
to
some
classic
belgian
beer
characteristics
in
unique
ways
i
would
love
to
see
this
one
become
a
regular
seasonal
because
it
is
quite
a
good
summertime
ipa
the
foray
is
probably
one
of
the
best
belgian
style
ipas
that
ive
had
the
beer
poured
a
slight
hazy
yellow
with
floaties
and
white
head
that
left
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
carried
belgian
yeast
and
sugar
mixed
with
pine
like
hops
the
taste
followed
suite
started
like
a
white
belgian
then
finished
like
a
west
coast
ipa
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
ipa
and
worth
a
shot
overall
i
cant
help
but
be
disappointed
by
this
one
pretty
weak
flavor
much
less
flavor
than
the
paulaner
hefe
i
had
before
this
frankly
when
your
ipa
is
getting
outflavored
by
a
hefeweizen
you
might
wanna
go
back
to
the
drawing

22oz

very

my
girlfriend
said

but
i
didnt
get
that
at
all
flavor
is
citrus
hops
very
light

backbone
doesnt
really
have
a
strong
brlgian
yeast
flavor
at
all
almost
seems
like
a
variation
of
chain
breaker
definitely
a
summer
drinker
good
stuff
overall
its
a
solid
beer
one
id
certainly
drink
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
acquire
deschutes
is
one
of
the
most
reliable
breweries
in
the
country
imho
and
do
not
disappoint
here
though
i
dont
feel
that
they
necessarily
broke
new
ground
either
nothing
wrong
with
that
not
every
brew
has
to
be
insert
current
crazepopular
innovation
here
despite
what
the
forums
would
have
you
believe
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
belgian
style
ipa
good
mix
of
fruit
esters
and
spice
with
a
citrus
presence
that
almost
tastes
like
straight
mango
juice
overall
i
often
have
mixed
feelings
about
belgian
ipas
as
sometimes
the
yeast
and
hops
dont
seem
to
get
along
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
well
integrated
and
balanced
and
it
was
hard
to
tell
what
flavors
were
imparted
by
the
hops
vs
the
yeast
this
is
a
massive
win
for
the
style
however
the
taste
is
slightly
muted
vs
some
other
examples
so
i
guess
that
was
the
trade
off
regardless
i
really
liked
it
fairly
light
bodied
zesty
carbo
im
not
digging
this
much
i
have
had
a
few
of
this
style
before
and
this
brew
doesnt
hold
up
to
any
of
them
imho
not
for
me
but
if
you
like
it
enjoy
did
not
dig
the
flavor
and
one
of
the
very
rare
deschutes
letdowns
o
i
like
it
but
i
think
i
got
my
hopes
up
too
much
all
things
that
come
from
deschutes
are
good
and
that
was
still
well
worth
the
try
overall
another
damn
tasty
brew
from
deschutes
they
never
really
disappoint
my
first
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
from
deschutes
and
of
course
they
nailed
it
a
very
session
like
ipa
low
malt
low
hops
big
apricot
taste
you
get
the
belgian
yeast
effect
for
sure
as
advertised
a
very
good
ipa
not
great
but
one
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
the
aroma
is
tropical
fruits
and
a
slight
pine
very
little
bitterness
but
big
flavors
despite
the
low
amount
of
malt
and
hops

that

into
a

floral
perhaps
a
bit

orange
too
very
nice
refreshing
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
imagine
its
one
you
have
to
have
fresh
another
very
nice
belgian
offering
here
this
one
was
quite
bitter
but
as
i
suspected
not
quite
as
bitter
as
some
of
the
american
style
beers
ive
reviewed
on
here
there
was
a
lot
of
spice
and
background
fruits
to
this
one
that
balanced
the
beer
out
well
and
the
tart
flavours
started
strong
but
settled
down
was
the
beer
had
time
to
open
up
a
little
overall
a
decent
beer
and
one
well
worth
picking
up
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
prairie
artisan
ales
teku
glass
toasted
penny
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
the
nose
is
similar
to
a
saison
or
tripel
yeast
cloves
banana
and
apple
tastes
of
sweet
malts
banana
spice
and
a
very
slight
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
very
end
of
the
aftertaste
medium
mouth
but
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
dry
crispness
for
a
beer
with
a
fairly
mellow
taste
theres
a
lot
of
complexity
i
really
like
how
theyve
made
an
interesting
beer
without
a
lot
of
big
flavors
quite
a
fantastic
beer
and
cheap8
for
750ml
for
being
so
highly
rated
by
the
bros
the
pour
to
this
was
astounding
as
the
fluffy
head
dark
golden
hue
cloudy
appearance
and
bubbles
on
the
side
of
my
pint
glass
all
combined
for
an
extremely
pleasing
first
impression
the
lacing
was
up
to
snuff
as
well
as
lots
of
soapy
layers
made
themselves
felt
once
i
worked
my
way
through
this
not
a
strong
aroma
to
this
beer
but
there
was
some
yeast
and
apple
to
be
found
in
the
nose
both
of
those
were
present
in
the
taste
along
with
the
grassy
hops
pear
candied
sugar
and
booze
underneath
everything
else
beer
was
a
little
foamy
when
poured
from
the
bottle
suggesting
some
issues
with
the
bottle
conditioning
but
the
mouthfeel
was
not
negatively
affected
o
one
of
the
most
complex
yet
simple
tastes
i
have
had
from
the
region
as
my
last
name
is
hommell
from
the
root
hommel
i
might
have
bumped
it
up
a
point
however
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic
highly
recommended
a
true
belgian
classic
with
very
few
beers
like
it
anywhere
in
the
world
high
in
alcohol
for
its
body
depth
maybe
but
it
still
manages
to
hide
the
fact
it
sits
at

good
solid
belgian

reminds
me
a
little
of
duvel
cloudy

hoppy
rich
taste
goes
down
smooth
very
little
aftertaste
good
belgian
but
not
in
the
rarefied

class
of
a
westvleteren
brew
would
try
again
purchased
in
newton
ma
at
the
craft
beer
cellar
prost
a
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
a
discerning
enthusiast
othis
is
a
very
unique
beer
i
tasted
two
bottles
and
the
second
had
far
more
bitter
sharp
hops
than
the
first
but
both
had
a
strange
honeyherbal
sweetness
to
them
im
not
sure
that
i
actually
liked
this
beer
but
i
was
so
intrigued
that
i
was
left
wanting
to
drink
it
again
excellent
belgian
ale
overall
i
really
feel
like
i
could
drink
gallons
of
this
beer
all
day
it
is
really
that
good
a
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
combined
with
a
hefty
bitterness
makes
this
one
extremely
quaffable
and
well
put
together
brew
id
like
like
to
try
again
see
if
the
metallic
flavorcompound
is
less
present
i
really
like
this
beer
especially
since
i
drank
from
tab
sitting
outside
in
the
sunshine
after
a
bike
tour
through
the
hop
gardens
around
poperinge
very
drinkable
with
a
dangerous
high
7

i
would
say
this
leans
more
towards
a
powerful
belgian
wheat
than
the
weird
flavors
you
would
get
in
another
belgian
ipa
50
mouthfeel
good
belgian
carbonation
there
is
an
oily
feel
from
the
hops
the
nice
fizzy
and
oily
feel
gives
it
a
semicreamy
feel
lingering
floral
and
that
twist
of
lemon
rind
on
the
aftertaste
o
quite
an
excellent
memorable
beer
tastes
a
bit
highbrow
quite
moreish
a
little
more
malt
grain
flavor
and
depth
would
be
nice
however
its
plenty
balanced
and
solid
for
what
it
is
old
favorite
of
mine
recommended
zesty
and
spicy
in
an
elegant
way
and
with
a
high
drinkability
hints
of
orange
herbs
and
honey
dry
aftertaste
and
here
you
feel
a
little
bit
more
its
hops
i
am
mentioning
this
as
the
title
suggests
a
good
deal
of
hops
so
it
felt
to
me
more
like
a
belgian
blond
ale
rather
than
a
belgian
ipa
7

abv
is
unnoticeable
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
full
of
flavors
and
refreshing
excellent
really
enjoyed
this
little
bottle
of
beer
an
inspiring
brew
to
say
the
least
and
wishing
i
could
say
more
nice
belgian
ipa
borders
on
belgian
pale
ale
territory
o
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
and
i
would
for
sure
get
this
beer
again
so
good
and
glad
i
was
able
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
this
o
a
wonderful
beer
from
a
wonderful
little
town
either
this
was
past
its
prime
or
im
missing
something
underwhelming
along
with
lots
of
off
putting
metallic
flavors
o
overall
the
taste
and
smell
is
cheap
and
stale
im
shocked
by
all
the
great
reviews
on
this
because
i
was
disappointed
lager
yeast
is
more
prevalent
than
the
expected
belgian
style
pretty
disappointed
in
this
selection
and
i
really
want
my
money
back
dont
waste
your
time
this
was
a
great
treat
firm
and
balanced
it
is
a
good
composition
of
strong
yeast
firm
malt
and
bitter
hops
for
an
interesting
and
complex
beer
more
on
the
belgium
ale
side
of
the
spectrum
it
combines
a
good
amount
of
hoppiness
to
lend
a
nice
bitterness
that
works
well
overall
this
ipa
is
incredible
when
served
chilled
wellbalanced
and
yet
not
too
overpowering
this
is
a
delicious
belgian
gem
done
right
pours
a
bright
golden
wit
a
thick
foamy
off
white
head
that
loudly
dissipated
smells
of
assorted
citrus
peels
mainly
lemon
with
some
tangy
belgian
yeast
it
tastes
great
lots
of
lemony
op
flavor
with
a
hint
of
pine
banana
and
lots
of
yeast
the
beer
is
light
with
lots
of
soft
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
i
could
live
off
of
these
guys
overall
an
outstanding
beer
not
many
good
belgian
ipas
out
there
but
this
one
is
really
good
like
most
european
beers
the
tastes
are
very
subtle
as
compared
to
americans
that
tend
to
be
out
front
ive
had
it
a
few
times
and
will
definitely
be
back
id
like
like
to
try
again
see
if
the
metallic
flavorcompound
is
less
present
poured
from
bottle
into
its
own
hommel
tulip
at
a
cafe
in
a
small
town
in
belgium

with
nice
white
foam
great
yeasty

aromas
slight

notes
taste
is
slightly
hoppy
peppery
citrusy
yeasty
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
with
this
really
great
traditional
belgian
ipa
not
overly
hopped
but
you
get
the
full
flavor
and
characteristics
of
the
mellow
hops
well
worth
a
try
this
seems
pretty
ho
hum
i
was
hopping
for
some
brighter
hop
characteristics
with
a
crisp
and
dryer
body
i
have
had
pretty
hoppy
beers
from
belgian
breweries
this
seems
to
subdued
and
mild
even
for
a
non
hop
head
like
me
one
that
loves
bright
crisp
non
bitter
hops
that
can
be
a
great
asset
for
the
style
this
aint
it
pours
a
pale
cloudy
gold
fantastic
lacing
quarter
inch
fine
foam

that
doesnt
dissipate
scent
of
cloves
fig
citrus
and
fine

taste
is

gentle
but
prominent
hops
pepper
sweet
citrus

mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
thick
almost
creamy
just
what
id
expect
from
a
good
belgian
brew
very
well
balanced
too
and
it
has
a
very
fine
light
sort
of
carbonation
a
unique
ipa
overall
a
phenomenal
brew
highly
recommended
ill
have
another
o
good
beer
for
the
style
but
the
bit
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
really
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
unable
to
guess
from
the
bottle
what
it
is
i
e
how
descriptive
is
hommel
i
wasnt
sure
if
this
was
a
highly
hopped
belgian
strong
pale
or
something
even
more
experimental
it
was
a
nice
drink
and
would
be
a
great
warm
weather
beer
though
the
well
hidden
7

abv
pushes
it
a
little
out
of
the
session
zone
tasty
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
notes
as
well
as
some
spices
grass
and
citrus
which
i
guess
comes
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
very
similar
with
a
lot
of
grass
and
citrus
notes
as
well
as
some
spicy
and
slightly
funky
belgian
yeast

will
be
having
this

overall
good
i
find
it
tough
to
review
belgian
ipas
theyre
supposed
to
be
sweetish
but
i
dont
always
want
them
to
be
good
hop
profile
in
this
one
though
overall
a
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
superb
ale
not
ordinary
by
any
means
but
just
downright
delicious
and
refreshing
as
hell
just
another
reason
to
love
those
belgians
a
nice
little
beer
not
sure
i
call
it
as
epic
as
some
others
but
its
real
nice
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
and
a
little
different
beer
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
beer
that
could
get
me
in
trouble
the
abv
is
masked
by
the
body
and
citrus
flavors
from
the
hops
i
also
really
love
the
nose
could
smell
this
beer
for
hours
this
is
a
delightful
beer
i
am
enjoying
the
fresh
orange
expression
due
to
the
hallertauer
or
maybe
theres
some
additional
orange
rind
thrown
in
the
bready
malt
and
orange
flavors
complement
the
funky
yeast
really
drinks
smoothly
and
the
abv
is
just
right
at
7
5
although
this
beer
has
a
reputation
for
being
hoppy
it
is
only
mildly
hoppy
with
low
alpha
acid
hops
and
in
the
fruity
orange
hop
direction
that
i
find
increasingly
enjoyable
citra
i
think
this
is
a
top
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
brewed
in
a
traditional
hop
growing
area
of
belgium
whats
not
to
like
not
so
easy
to
find
in
ca
glad
i
went
to
the
bottle
barn
in
santa
rosa
now
i
hope
to
find
this
on
draft
sometime
quite
nice
but
definitely
not
hoppy
more
like
a
belgian
blonde
or
golden
ale
however
ive
come
across
other
reviews
comparing
ipas
to
this
beer
so
perhaps
the
example
i
have
has
faded
or
been
mishandled
ill
try
it
again
at
some
point
at
any
rate
it
has
a
subtle
wellbalanced
character
and
impressive
body
that
make
it
highly
drinkable
well
worth
sampling
750ml
corked
caged
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
with
a
frothy
sticky
head
that
settles
to
a
rocky
foamy
landscapy
thing
smells
of
medicinal
phenols
sugar
and
citrus
taste
is
crisp
apples
then
quickly
settles
to
a
very
pleasant
biscuity
earthiness
very
light
very
refreshing
wow
i
like
this
a
lot
mouthfeel
is
tingly
carbonation
followed
up
by
a
finish
slicker
than
a
snake
who
graduated
from
oil
wrestling
academy
they
have
that
overall
a
really
great
beer
im
not
sure
the
style
definition
of
a
belgian
ipa
but
the
hops
are
very
subtle
just
contributing
flavor
without
that
in
your
face
bitterness
i
exprected
it
is
light
refreshing
and
yet
substantial
im
adding
this
to
the
rotation
for
sure
the
beer
pours
an
effervescent
golden
with
no
head
or
haze
it
smells
disappointing
there
is
a
slight
indication
of
hops
but
nothing
that
would
lead
me
to
believe
it
was
either
belgain
or
an
ipa
the
taste
was
a
light
honey
sweetness
with
citrus
zest
but
still
no
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
initially
tolerable
but
became
syrupy
sweet
and
gross
after
awhile
i
would
probably
never
try
this
beer
again
on
tap
although
maybe
in
bottles
d
pretty
easy
drinking
but
certainly
not
an
ipa
a
little
bit
filling
due
to
the
hefty
carbonation
alcohol
is
strong
but
well
hidden
o
this
beer
is
rather
yeasty
but
its
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
tart
citrus
on
nose
fresh
hops
with
a
metallic
edge
the
mineral
character
continues
on
the
palate
sour
and
finishing
with
a
long
tart
green
apple
that
refuses
to
go
away
in
a
good
way
this
is
not
the
malty
belgian
ipa
you
are
used
to
but
rather
all
about
freshness
crispness
and
drinkability
pair
with
thai
or
indianfood
o
a
nice
moderately
hoppy
belgian
ale
houblon
chouffe
is
the
better
widely
available
offering
in
the
belgian
ipa
style
group
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
hazy
gold
color
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
the
retention
is
pretty
strong
here
where
the
lacing
doesnt
really
do
too
much
the
smell
of
the
beer
isnt
overly
hoppy
there
is
a
surprising
sweetness
in
there
actually
it
smells
rather
grainy
with
just
a
touch
of
citrus
in
there
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
metallic
side
in
the
very
beginning
of
each
sip
the
flavors
changes
nicely
as
it
settles
on
the
tastebuds
its
got
a
super
mellow
hoppy
bitterness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
very
smooth
but
has
a
really
nice
carbonation
to
it
also
overall
this
was
impressive
to
me
i
wasnt
sure
how
much
i
would
like
it
but
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
around
overall
i
received
this
for
volunteering
four
months
ago
at
the
bbf
and
what
a
treat
it
is
i
am
very
happy
to
have
gotten
this
in
my
volunteer
box
and
will
be
looking
for
more
of
it
in
the
future
label
may
look
strange
but
the
beer
is
far
from
strange
and
very
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
is
arguably
the
finest
part
of
this
beer
its
a
true
mediumbodied
beer
that
is
pleasant
to
swish
around
in
your
mouth
flavor
excluded
overall
though
this
is
a
disappointment
it
strikes
me
as
a
cluttered
indecisive
beer
whose
yeast
has
run
roughshod
over
everything
else
overall
a
delightful
beer
i
love
a
good
strong
belgian
pale
ale
and
this
fills
that
bill
as
well
as
bringing
in
the
bitterness
to
back
up
the
stylistic
sweetness
a
great
beer
not
cheap
but
i
dont
feel
ripped
off
this
ones
worth
a
try
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
chewy
sweet
with
a
semi
dry
finish
poured
into
a
stem
glass
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
cap
of
foamy
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
pale
malts
honey
light
fruity
esters
and
sunshowers
in
a
flower
garden
taste
of
honey
and
sweet

up

with
an
almost
instantaneous
blast
of
spice
and
citrusy
goodness
bready
belgian
yeast
pepper
cloves
pears
and
peaches
complex
and
tasty
and
quite
light
in
the
mouth
nice
and
drinkable
overall
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
had
actually
this
is
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
ever
had
a
decent
ipa
rendered
flandersstyle
though
not
as
zingy
as
some
of
its
brethrencompetitors
the
yeast
has
a
lot
to
do
with
that
as
does
the
hops
nature
i
would
imagine
oh
what
the
hell
ayeeee
chee
waaawaaa
and
according
to
an
encounter
with
marge
hes
belgian
aye
yi
yi
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
the
fact
that
it
pulls
some
surprises
for
a
belgian
beer
is
a
great
surprise
and
is
very
compatible
with
the
north
american
palate
this
thing
is
a
must
try
overall
a
decent
brew
but
unremarkable
in
my
opinion
i
think
this
style
bipa
has
so
much
to
offer
and
so
many
ways
to
go
around
and
try
and
find
something
unique
that
i
really
cant
in
good
conscious
say
that
i
see
this
as
a
anything
other
than
a
malty
hoped
up
brew
the
color
is
golden
yellow
hazy
nice
white
soapy
head
that
crowns
the
beer
nice
looking
the
aroma
presents
notes
of
belgian
yeasttypical
of
belgian
beers
some
floral
notes
there
i
would
have
thought
the
aroma
to
be
stronger
it
is
good
but
appears
to
be
weak
in
intensity
it
isnt
bad
tho
on
the
taste
the
first
sip
shows
notes
of
metal
the
finish
is
very
dry
with
belgian
yeast
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
i
like
this
and
it
isnt
heavy
has
belgian
beers
could
be
sometimes
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
stemmed
tulip
poured
a
murky
red
brown
with
a
three
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
bread
and
banana
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bread
dark
fruit
banana
and
subtle
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
the
flavors
on
this
one
were
really
well
balanced
and
refreshing
which
is
a
welcome
change
for
this
style
for
me
the
aroma
was
also
quite
inviting
and
pleasant
to
the
nose
really
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
buying
and
drinking
one
of
these
might
be
buying
a
few
more
to
keep
in
my
fridge
yearround
overall
this
is
an
excellent
ale
and
i
liked
the
inclusion
of
both
sweet
and
sour
notes
well
worth
trying
d
this
is
a
very
musty
example
of
the
style
with
a
thick
malt
base
it
seems
to
have
an
unusually
high
level
of
malt
flavor
and
sweetness
for
a
belgian
brewed
beer
and
it
is
barely
balanced
despite
the
strong
hop
character
not
bad
but
i
tend
to
prefer
belgian
ipas
that
are
brewed
with
american
character
hops
to
contrast
the
yeast
and
malt
those
with
grassy
continental
hops
are
a
bit
too
dull
for
my
taste
o
definitely
a
great
belgian
style
ipa
hoppier
than
other
belgian
ipas
ive
had
as
well
as
being
sweeter
pleasantly
surprised
dont
miss
out
on
this
one
overall
great
example
of
how
a
hoppy
beer
should
be
jd
time
to
try
a
belgian
ipa
thats
actually
from
belgium
instead
of
american
attempts
on
this
style
this
is
a
great
looking
brew
for
sure
it
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
color
crested
by
a
huge
fluffy
head
that
laces
well
the
aroma
is
entirely
dominated
by
sweet
bubblegummy
belgian
yeasts
try
as
i
may
i
cant
coax
out
any
of
the
other
wonderful
scents
other
reviewers
posted
sweet
belgian
yeasts
thats
it
the
taste
on
this
is
fairly
nice
the
hoppiness
comes
through
much
better
leaving
the
sweet
yeasts
as
a
backing
role
theres
also
a
nice
floral
character
but
all
this
is
let
down
by
a
fairly
strong
metallic
note
that
comes
through
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
fairly
light
and
creamy
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
perhaps
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
yeasts
especially
on
the
nose
but
otherwise
good
an
excellent
tasting
beer
well
balanced
with
a
nice
finish
definitely
give
this
one
a
try

dr
it
goes

theres
hardly

it
worth
trying
just
to
experience
this
strange

the
smell
is
absolutely

sadly
the

doesnt

which
accentuates
the
belgians
commitment
to
craft
not
just
extremity
this
is
a
top
notch
belgian
ipa
this
beer
improved
greatly
as
it
warmed
up
i
like
the
way
the
yeast
improved
on
the
flavor
in
the
last
pour
from
the
bottle
an
interesting
brew
to
me
it
was
lambic
meets
pils
and
actually
benefiting
from
both
sides
overall
this
beer
definitely
makes
my
top
ten
list
unbelievable
i
will
buy
this
every
time
i
see
it
the
flavor
matches
the
aroma
exactly
sour
malt
base
with
a
yeasty
bite
with
a
light
bittering
hop
interestingly
there
isnt
much
hop
in
the
aftertaste
again
its
mostly
sour
the
body
tilts
to
the
thinner
side
but
theres
also
a
lighter
than
usual
carbonation
overall
i
would
not
call
this
a
belgian
ipa
d
easy
drinker
could
sit
with
one
or
two
a
night
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
couldnt
decipher
the
date
markings
but
i
wonder
if
the
mustiness
was
due
to
age
as
a
belgian
ipa
and
supposedly
a
pinnacle
example
of
the
style
i
am
a
little
disappointed
in
what
this
has
to
offer
the
hops
were
too
mild
for
me
to
pick
up
much
hop
flavors
on
the
whole
this
felt
like
an
average
tripel
crossed
very
lightly
with
an
ipa
which
is
not
well
hopped
it
is
still
a
good
beer
nonetheless
but
im
not
so
sure
if
it
really
lives
up
well
to
its
style
md
medium
silky
mouth
with
a
great
fizz
to
finish
if
only
a
little
drier
i
would
have
scored
it
even
higher
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
honestly
i
expecfted
a
lot
more
from
what
people
said
about
this
beer
doesnt
even
begin
to
compare
to
houblon
chouffe
pours
a
orangish
body
with
real
good
frothy
head
that
dies
slow
with
lace
a
spicy
sour
grapetart
fruit
and
citric
hop
aroma
as
well
as
yeasty
something
like
apple
or
pear
in
as
well
little
bit
of
sugariness
for
sweetness
and
some
spices
come
in
as
well
great
balance
comes
to
my
mind
especially
for
the
belgian
take
on
this
style
slightly
smooth
and
creamy
the
beer
is
lightbodied
but
still
has
a
carbonation
that
makes
the
beer
sharp
and
pronounces
the
citric
hops
which
abound
great
balance
is
achieved
with
tart
fruit
tastes
like
grape
skin
apple
and
pear
clove
and
pepper
round
out
the
body
which
has
a
good
candisugar
and
caramel
sweetness
as
well
a
grainy
bready
touch
easy
to
drink
with
good
fruit
and
sweetness
while
still
maintaing
a
large
hop
edge
this
beer
finishes
real
crisp
and
is
a
must
for
anyone
who
appreciates
belgian
ales
d
very
refreshing
when
served
cold
delightfully
wild
when
it
warms
definitely
worth
a
repeat
poured
from
a
corked
and
caged
750
ml
bottle
into
a
chalice
at
around
4550
degrees
f
poured
a
soapy
white
head
about
an
inch
thick
eventually
forming
a
dense
cap
lots
of
lacing
the
beer
is
dark
straw
or
gold
with
small
bubbles
a
bit
cloudy
but
the
yeast
was
disturbed
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
grass
hay
and
perhaps
a
little
clove
or
spice
but
i
find
it
a
bit
muted
flavors
of
lemongrass
resin
and
citrus
seem
to
dominate
at
first
supported
by
honey
and
a
definite
graininess
the
beer
finishes
exceptionally
dry
almost
puckeringly
so
something
like
a
hoppy
saison
or
a
really
really
hoppy
tripel
carbonation
is
highly
evident
throughout
presents
as
a
light
bodied
beer
and
quite
refreshing
carbonation
is
too
high
overall
an
amazingly
good
beer
i
would
buy
it
by
the
barrelfull
frothy
offwhite
head
is
semiloose
with
a
fair
bit
of
larger
bubbles
quickly
brings
it
down
from
over
two
fingers
to
a
thin
coating
across
the
surface
the
lacing
is
wispy
but
there
light
orange
to
yellow
color
hazy
with
close
to
full
opacity
a
few
beads
here
and
there
visible
earthy
peaty
tarry
nose
with
lichens
tree
bark
black
tea
leaves
brown
rice
before
slowly
switching
gears
into
lemon
orange
pith
biscuit
white
pepper
and
a
small
core
of
apricot
white
peach
yellow
apple
white
grape
fruit
scents
lasts
well
fullbodied
the
carbonation
is
gentle
and
pushes
things
out
towards
your
cheeks
clove
pepper
yeast
and
country
style
multigrain
bread
trump
the
damp
earth
forest
floor
matter
components
still
the
grapefruit
orange
citrus
more
dry
pith
than
zest
or
juice
the
apricot
peach
apple
fruit
not
that
sweet
spiked
by
cinnamon
notes
then
maybe
witch
hazel
and
banana
as
it
warms
never
fully
loses
the
earthy
wet
grass
dimension
but
doesnt
seem
unclean
popperings
hommel
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
bit
of
head
but
not
too
much
it
is
the
taste
and
drinkability
that
it
truly
excels
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
try
it
please
do
so
eh
i
was
wrong
beer
is
weak
in
the
flavor
department
and
in
the
bitterness
department
medium
to
light
in
body
some
esters
on
the
mid
palate
but
the
finish
is
nonexistent
the
forward
flavors
are
weak
and
subdued
make
an
ipa
seriously
d
my
favourite
belgian
ipa
because
of
it
subtleness
and
balance
this
really
is
the
benchmark
of
the
style
that
non
belgian
examples
just
cannot
match
for
whatever
reason
d
easy
to
drink
no
alc
taste
a
good
beer
but
not
impressive
the
balance
of
the
flavors
of
this
beer
was
very
nice
very
drinkable
for
me
ive
had
a
few
of
these
at
the
monkey
d
an
above
average
offering
and
a
treat
from
the
tap
in
the
center
of
hop
production
in
belgium
best
matches
are
earthy
flavors
cheese
roasted
veggies
crusty
bread
or
crackers
salami
with
stout
mustard
exceptional
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
holds
up
to
the
hopping
some
lemon
from
the
hops
good
malt
sweetness
and
pleasantly
nutty
with
butterscotch
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
the
balance
of
complex
flavors
in
this
beer
definitely
something
i
will
come
back
to
enjoyable
beer
drinks
easy
not
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
but
a
greattasty
example
of
the
style
despite
the
green
the
bottle
the
taste
is
smooth
and
apple
as
well
the
7
5
abv
is
not
massive
but
for
how
easy
this
one
is
to
consume
id
take
this
one
every
day
the
large
price
tag
is
a
major
block
for
this
pours
a
hazy
bright
orange
color
with
visible
particles
and
a
great
two
to
two
and
a
half
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
lacing
up
and
down
the
glass
leaving
rings
after
every
drink
the
smell
is
of
belgium
hops
as
well
as
a
nice
sweet
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
clove
and
citrus
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
with
belgium
hop
bite
that
is
not
too
bitter
there
is
also
hints
of
yeast
clove
green
apples
and
cinnimon
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
full
the
drinkability
is
great
so
smooth
and
such
as
nice
flavor
you
can
easily
have
more
than
one
of
these
cheers
taste
makes
up
for
the
smell
very
nice
belgian
malt
and
mild
belgian
hops
so
easy
to
drink
it
is
somewhat
sweet
with
citrus
the
body
is
rather
heavy
alcohol
is
not
evident
and
this
beer
is
too
drinkable
for
my
own
good
very
nice
beer
i
think
fresh
is
good
with
this
one
drinkability
price
considered
5
per
11
2oz
bottle
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
believe
this
was
my
first
sample
of
a
belgian
ipa
and
it
was
a
decent
beer
worth
trying
this
is
a
big
belgian
ale
the
mixture
of
earthiness
almost
nutty
at
times
and
tartness
provides
a
unique
and
enjoyable
ale
from
belgium
drinkability
very
interesting
taste
for
a
belgian
ipa
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
could
have
several
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
beers
ive
had
it
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
it
seems
to
bottle
and
transport
well
d
nice
and
light
would
go
well
with
dinner
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
im
not
sure
about
this
beer
i
reviewed
it
well
as
it
was
a
good
beer
its
just
different
but
i
think
its
different
in
a
good
way
its
not
in
your
face
but
definitely
doesnt
disappoint
a
nice
change
from
american
ipas
ontap
at
monks
in
philly
served
in
a
tulip
went
great
with
my
bowl
of
mussels
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
but
this
was
still
a
great
belgian
ale
theres
a
mellow
spicy
flavor
that
never
overwhelms
the
character
but
certainly
defines
the
beer
with
subtle
pepper
dry
herb
and
lemon
peel
for
the
strength
the
body
is
still
easy
to
drink
like
it
should
be
for
the
style
overall
this
is
really
a
classic
worth
picking
up
i
looked
at
the
sediment
in
several
different
lightings
and
even
shone
a
flashlight
thru
it
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
heck
were
the
floaties
more
experienced
reviewers
should
probably
ignore
this
observation
but
i
found
it
rather
interesting
although
not
especially
appealing
d
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
it
is
a
wellmade
belgian
golden
beer
with
an
elevated
hop
level
hopheads
who
hear
of
it
may
be
disappointed
when
they
try
it
but
to
me
the
hop
level
is
enough
to
add
complexity
without
totally
knocking
the
beer
out
of
balance
m
d
with
the
body
of
a
tripel
but
drier
and
hoppier
on
the
finish
it
drinks
accordingly
co2
turned
out
fine
for
an
exuberant
gusher
and
the
abv
was
undetectable
i
went
out
and
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
after
reading
the
great
reviews
on
ba
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
flavor
maybe
my
expectations
were
too
high
but
definitely
worth
trying
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
it
laces
the
glass
color
is
yellow
with
slight
orange
hue
and
cloudy
with
lots
of
carbonation
aroma
is
very
pleasant
citrus
notes
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
alcohol
taste
is
decent
but
not
great
it
has
a
little
hop
bite
and
aftertaste
is
a
little
phenolic
mouthfeel
is
good
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
very
good
we
got
a
magnum
of
this
poured
into
a
wine
glass
a
hazy
golden
with
lots
of
white
head
the
smell
is
peppery
the
taste
is
almost
like
a
wit
but
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
more
of
the
continental
grassy
type
than
floral
american
good
overall
not
great
d
a
solid
brew
recommended
by
the
owner
of
my
local
bottleshop
comfortably
in
the
belgian
ipa
category
but
i
think
a
bigger
hop
content
would
not
only
solidify
that
designation
but
also
improve
the
rating
in
the
smell
and
taste
departments
definitely
worth
a
try
d
these
belgian
ipas
always
challenge
my
palate
and
this
was
a
drinkable
one
gotta
say
that
i
preferred
the
houblon
chouffe
d
a
friend
of
mine
recommended
this
to
me
and
i
would
gladly
recommend
this
to
anyone
had
it
with
a
big
pasta
dinner
went
with
it
wonderfully
quite
quaffable
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
flavour
the
body
is
full
and
creamy
carbonation
level
is
a
little
lower
than
id
like
a
little
slick
going
down
nice
earthy
bitter
flavors
in
this
one
no
sharp
hops
but
just
a
nice
subtle
bitterness
that
doesnt
last
long
and
is
not
grating
at
all
mild
honey
flavor
in
there
as
well
some
yeasty
aspects
noted
definitely
belgian
i
liked
this
offering
probably
one
of
the
better
of
the
styles
that
ive
had
recommend
d
the
beer
doesnt
feel
like
7
5
at
least
at
first
i
went
through
the
glass
rather
quickly
and
felt
it
in
the
long
run
overall
a
very
nice
earthy
hop
forward
ale
it
isnt
my
first
choice
for
this
style
but
it
isnt
bad
pours
a
simply
beautiful
but
slightly
hazy
goldenyellow
slight
orange
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
that
recedes
rather
quickly
to
a
white
fresh
looking
ring
with
nice
clinging
lace
on
the
side
the
smell
is
slight
clove
with
a
stronger
citrus
hop
and
spice
smell
i
also
smell
various
fruits
like
bananas
and
pears
the
taste
is
a
blend
of
hops
and
malts
and
citrus
and
yeast
not
bitter
at
all
as
it
warms
has
a
little
sour
taste
that
is
good
this
is
easy
drinking
it
is
a
little
sweetsour
it
changes
as
it
warms
and
syrup
tasting
unlike
the
smell
overall
its
a
great
ipa
nicely
balanced
crisp
and
clean
with
a
medium
mouth
feel
its
not
one
to
drink
alot
of
in
one
sitting
imo
but
one
to
try
i
enjoyed
this
one
f
finishes
slightly
pale
and
bitter
a
little
more
so
than
the
taste
a
little
dryness
comes
in
but
not
too
much
as
a
little
of
that
sweet
malt
flavor
lingers
as
well
as
syrupy
a
little
chewy
flavor
lingers
too
still
waiting
on
the
nice
hops
but
seeing
as
how
belgians
tend
to
sit
in
warehouses
and
shelves
for
a
while
and
being
an
ipa
it
may
be
contrasted
i
also
noticed
it
has
best
before
0909
so
its
older
than
it
should
be
ill
have
to
see
if
i
can
find
a
fresh
one
or
have
it
on
tap
somewhere
overall
i
was
very
happy
to
try
this
as
i
have
seen
it
many
times
but
never
consumed
it
due
to
the
no
frills
label
my
mistake
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
my
preferences
for
belgian
ipas
lean
towards
the
american
take
on
the
style
an
ipa
brewed
with
belgian
yeast
rather
than
a
tripel
with
some
extra
hops
but
this
is
good
nonetheless
this
beer
is
all
about
freshness
bottles
in
the
states
have
been
variable
but
one
time
i
had
it
on
tap
in
amsterdam
it
was
freshly
written
on
the
chalkboard
beer
list
and
the
waitress
said
they
had
just
tapped
the
keg
that
day
boy
what
a
difference
great
floralcitrusy
hop
aroma
along
with
a
grassy
yeastiness
the
beer
was
crisp
dry
slightly
sour
with
great
hop
flavor
a
fine
mousse
and
a
great
finsh
that
balanced
maltalcohol
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
tangy
acidity
outstanding
d
really
easy
drinking
for
the
style
really
i
finished
the
11
2
ounces
within
a
few
minutes
it
is
probably
too
expensive
to
drink
very
much
of
but
if
money
were
no
object
i
could
drink
3
or
4
of
them
4
0
great
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
flavors
of
honey
chamomile
tea
and
minerals
with
a
little
bit
of
middle
eastern
spices
lurking
bisuity
malt
with
well
intergrated
hops
and
a
refreshing
drinkability
earthy
dry
finish
this
beer
has
a
way
of
disapearing
quickly
d
excellent
like
the
complexity
despite
the
consistent
undercurrent
of
bitter
hops
i
usually
like
belgian
ipas
because
of
the
layers
of
flavor
you
can
peel
away
american
ipas
are
more
of
a
onetrick
pony
this
is
an
oustanding
beer
d
not
bad
but
the
flavor
is
not
for
me
if
you
like
belgian
ipas
then
this
is
right
up
your
alley
i
prefer
the
american
ipas
d
insanely
quaffable
classy
and
sophisticated
smooth
even
delicate
the
flavors
are
highly
hopped
and
can
feel
a
touch
of
honey
in
the
aroma
that
is
quite
characteristic
like
any
india
pale
ale
that
respect
we
also
find
the
purifying
force
of
hops
in
the
tasting
this
one
tinged
with
a
character
of
yeast
rather
pronounced
in
conclusion
an
archetype
of
the
strong
hoppy
beer
that
will
appeal
to
all
slightly
beaten
this
is
a
sipperotherwise
far
too
overwhelming
please
try
this
out
the
taste
is
slightly
meaty
with
a
lightly
fruity
warm
but
restrained
alcoholic
quality
a
light
but
firm
maltiness
with
some
grain
hint
of
coriander
citrus
but
otherwise
a
lot
of
grassyleafy
hops
some
spiciness
its
balanced
in
bitterness
and
sweetness
a
bit
on
the
drier
side
it
has
a
slight
oiliness
d
i
was
impressed
i
went
in
expecting
nothing
and
was
surprised
i
would
have
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
a
very
good
beer
to
me
which
i
always
find
well
balanced
full
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
a
definite
session
beer
and
a
recommendation
to
try
this
brew
as
its
good
on
its
own
and
very
good
with
a
meal
d
at
7
5
abv
this
is
probably
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
belgian
almost
too
drinkable
notice
that
i
said
almost
d
this
is
a
deceptively
strong
beer
which
seems
to
be
a
hallmark
of
this
style
it
goes
down
easily
my
glass
was
gone
in
what
seemed
like
record
time
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
an
excellent
pickup
wellput
together
brew
nice
palate
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
few
beers
are
this
light
with
this
much
flavor
another
goody
from
the
shelves
of
ohooves

extremely
cloudy
tan

color
with
a

white
fluffy
head
and
lots
of
splotchy
lace
the
aroma
is
bready
malt
with
light
citrus
orangelemon
pleasant
the
flavor
brings
a
bright
tart
lemon
yeast
that
bites
the
tongue
this
mellows
as
you
go
and
offers
more
malty
nutmeg
and
some
floral
edges
and
clove
well
carbonated
decent
drinker
refreshing
all
around
good
stuff
for
the
style
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
nice
hoppy
finish
medium
body
carbonation
is
appropriate
pretty
easy
drinker
and
a
really
interesting
beer
good
stuff
thanks
to
khiasmus
for
the
recommendation
soft
cushy
bottle
conditioned
texture
the
well
balanced
hoppiness
makes
this
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
it
helps
that
i
enjoy
a
heavy
dose
of
black
pepper
i
tend
to
love
ipas
so
a
great
bartender
recommended
this
to
me
smell
was
an
accurate
introduction
bold
floral
and
citrus
notes
in
the
taste
detected
a
hint
of
apricot
extremely
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
was
simple
and
light
and
let
the
balanced
taste
of
hops
be
the
hero
drinkability
was
supreme
i
wanted
nothing
but
this
beer
when
i
first
tried
it
d
the
numbers
in
this
review
may
be
somewhat
arbitrary
as
im
not
sure
what
constitutes
a
good
belgian
ipa
id
always
imagined
and
read
them
as
hopped
up
tripels
and
while
poperings
hommel
ale
exhibits
some
hoppy
characteristics
and
some
tripel
characteristics
it
isnt
a
simple
mix
of
the
two
furthermore
i
understand
that
this
brew
was
once
classified
as
a
bspa
though
the
hops
never
really
take
the
center
stage
its
extremely
well
balanced
even
if
not
a
standout
among
belgians
an
enjoyable
and
somewhat
challenging
beer
that
i
hope
to
revisit
when
and
if
i
understand
the
style
better
d
decently
quaffable
for
the
style
another
solid
belgian
ipa
though
for
the
price
id
probably
stick
with
houblon
chouffe
i
think
this
was
my
first
belgian
ipa
but
im
sure
ill
buy
this
one
again
this
beer
pours
a
lovely
amber
hue
which
leaves
a
distinct
creamy
two
finger
head
which
leaves
prominent
sticky
lacing
all
down
the
glassthis
beer
smells
of
beautiful
freshly
herbalrose
boutiques
with
beautiful
fresh
elegant
hop
aromas
like
it
they
have
just
been
harvestedthe
taste
of
this
beer
has
no
bitterness
at
all
to
it
and
could
def
not
be
classed
as
full
ipa
or
even
a
belgian
ipa
but
never
the
less
a
beautiful
floral
hoppy
showcasing
of
a
beer
with
a
sweet
finish
definately
not
bitter
at
all
and
very
easily
drinkable
skip
this
one
and
go
straight
for
the
piraat
not
the
typical
taste
you
would
expect
from
an
ipa
this
had
a
nice
crispness
to
it
lots
of
citrus
going
on
but
more
like
orange
than
grapefruit
and
while
the
hop
bitterness
is
present
its
not
overwhelming
you
get
a
lot
of
grassiness
with
this
beer
this
was
unexpected
in
a
good
way
a
nice
beer
to
have
while
sitting
on
the
patio
in
the
summer
edit
ive
tried
this
since
and
was
not
as
enamored
still
a
wonderful
beer
im
looking
forward
to
drinking
it
fresh
in
belgium
again
light
to
medium
body
quite
smooth
throughout
with
just
touch
of
resins
in
the
finish
prickly
spritzy
carbonation
is
otherwise
moderate
but
gives
moments
of
fluffiness
and
is
very
refreshing
drinkability
for
a
7
5
belgian
with
yeast
hanging
out
in
the
bottom
this
didnt
hold
up
well
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
bad
bottle
either
maybe
this
needs
to
be
consumed
fresh
but
like
i
said
i
thought
it
would
at
least
be
decent
maybe
ill
try
and
get
a
fresh
one
and
rereview
but
those
of
you
who
have
it
id
try
it
now
if
youre
thinking
of
holding
onto
it
because
it
was
an
experience
we
all
threw
off
my
third
floor
balcony
instead
of
finishing
our
small
amounts
in
the
glass

d
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
the
lack
of
hops
there
are
definitely
some
better
belgian
ipas
out
there
if
you
cant
find
them
this
is
worth
a
try
very
good
belgian
ipa
but
it
has
strong
style
competition
the
beer
pours
a
bright
hazy
gold
with
an
excellent
puffy
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
the
nose
is
a
very
sweet
aroma
of
candied
lemons
and
subtle
earthy
belgian
yeast
while
there
is
a
strong
hop
presence
in
the
beer
its
not
the
hoppiest
bipa
out
there
the
malt
contributes
a
flavor
of
wildflower
honey
the
hops
are
grassy
lemony
and
floral
its
an
interesting
flavor
profile
but
the
beer
doesnt
quite
grab
me
like
some
bipas
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
its
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
would
love
to
have
access
to
this
stuff
for
cheaper
d
good
overall
but
expected
more
hoppiness
ah
yea
um
if
you
drink
beer
if
you
respect
beer
the
journey
through
a
bottle
of
poperings
hommel
is
time
and
money
well
spent
this
is
a
well
balanced
dynamic
beer
has
a
tremendous
sweetness
of
malt
quickly
broken
by
a
soft
bite
of
hop
with
fat
bubbles
confusing
the
complex
blend
of
a
malty
sweetness
for
ale
lovers
and
fantastic
hop
aromas
and
bite
without
ruination
of
palate
for
hop
heads
a
must
at
least
oncetwice
and
more
drinkable
smooth
and
easy
i
went
into
this
one
knowing
nothing
of
the
beer
and
not
knowing
really
what
to
expect
i
poured
up
absolutely
beautiful
moderately
cloudy
yelloworange
body
with
a
gorgeous
tightly
knit
two
inch
thick
head
that
stayed
that
way
for
several
minutes
exceptional
head
retention
smell
was
mostly
spices
some
mild
cooked
fruit
and
little
else
taste
was
heavy
on
the
spice
and
had
that
metallic
after
taste
thing
that
some
belgians
have
but
i
really
did
enjoy
it
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
rather
assertive
on
the
co2
this
was
a
really
good
beer
that
i
am
very
glad
i
discovered

is
hurt
by
how
cloying
it
is
despite
the
atypical
amount
of
hop

and
bitterness
for
a
belgian
this
has
a
sweet
perfume
kind
of
thing
going
on
that
doesnt
necessarily
keep
you
coming
back
its
damn
tasty
for
the

two
though
ontap
at

served

the
taste
is

the
beer
has
a
nice
dryness
that
along
with
the
bitterness
leaves
you
craving
the
next
sip
this
is
a
very
refreshing
thirst

beer
the

is

malty
with
plenty
of

there
is

the

is

like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
not
even
average
i
would
not
drink
again
looks
much
better
than
it
ends
up
tasting
have
had
this
on
tap
much
better
m
bottle
conditioned
effervescent
carbonation
yum
more
like
a
hoppy
belgian
pale
ale
and
not
even
that
hoppy
a
very
nice
ipa
one
that
will
enjoyed
and
preferred
by
those
who
dont
like
their
ipas
to
be
overly
bitter
nevertheless
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
ipa
and
is
much
better
on
tap
then
it
is
out
of
the
bottle
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
could
drink
a
few
but
its
not
one
that
would
select
over
too
many
others
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
i
think
its
about
halfway
in
between
a
trippel
and
a
belgian
ipa
the
hops
are
there
but
not
as
crisp
as
i
was
expecting
worth
a
shot
d
notes
of
both
wit
and
belgian
pale
in
this
beer
tasty
drinkability
smooth
easy
to
drink
pairs
well
with
cheese
not
so
good
by
itself
i
bought
this
on
a
whim
and
had
no
idea
it
was
a
belgian
ipa
i
did
not
do
my
research
and
i
am
not
disappointed
d
you
could
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
great
for
the
style
really
a
solid
offering
drinkability
is
excellent
not
so
alcoholic
and
the
lighter
nature
of
this
beer
with
its
relative
lack
of
fruity
yeasty
esters
and
less
of
that
heavy
sweetness
make
it
easy
to
quaff
the
beer
has
a
lingering
aromatic
head
smells
beautifully
floral
hoppy
but
without
the
bitterness
unique
avec
les
bons
voeux
comes
close
and
is
probably
even
better
well
the
beer
is
better
overall
but
the
aroma
isnt
the
mouth
feel
is
lovely
a
good
mousse
tiny
bubbles
not
big
ones
like
in
a
carbonated
drink
but
like
in
a
fine
champagne
so
you
dont
need
to
burp
after
a
mouth
full
this
is
a
fine
bottled
beer
but
peerless
on
draught
truly
truly
one
of
the
worlds
finest
beers
definitely
different
from
the
first
bottle
why
recipe
change
wrong
batch
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissapears
arom
is
kind
of
bland
with
hints
of
light
crisp
fruit
and
a
strong
alcohol
presence
carbonated
up
front
tickling
the
tounge
with
a
sweet
light
crisp
fruit
center
and
dry
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
subtle
hop
and
apple
notes
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
balanced
and
i
love
the
sour
flavors
and
aromas
again
not
as
good
as
ive
had
in
belgium
but
still
a
fine
beer
this
beer
is
amazing
it
has
the
intangibles
it
needs
to
make
it
world
class
theres
not
one
thing
about
it
that
i
can
point
out
and
say
thats
awesome
but
the
whole
thing
comes
together
and
forms
this
i
might
could
drink
this
every
day
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
im
really
not
sure
why
a
pretty
good
abv
and
very
smooth
im
glad
i
finally
checked
this
one
out
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
gold
in
color
with
2
fingers
of
pillowy
white
head
that
exhibits
great
retention
and
leaves
behind
lots
of
lacing
great
aroma
somewhat
subdued
in
terms
of
intensity
but
very
complex
there
is
some
sweet
malt
some
herbal
hop
notes
a
smattering
of
fruity
esters
and
a
slight
phenolic
presence
taste
is
really
quite
good
good
herbalearthy
hop
flavor
a
moderate
bitterness
and
a
wonderful
drying
malt
character
that
is
present
throughout
yeast
character
is
relatively
restrained
but
characteristic
light
fruity
esters
and
lightly
spicy
phenols
are
present
good
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
boy
and
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
im
not
really
sure
if
id
classify
this
as
a
belgian
ipa
then
again
maybe
my
bottle
wasnt
at
its
freshest
but
this
is
one
fine
bier
this
brew
seems
to
transform
with
time
from
a
hoppy
ipa
to
a
more
mellow
and
balanced
belgian
bier
tasted
on
71808
d
drinkability
is
good
even
though
this
isnt
quite
what
i
expected
its
still
quite
good
flavorful
complex
fairly
smooth
all
things
i
look
for
in
a
good
beer
hops
are
just
not
there
given
this
is
an
ipa
of
the
belgian
variety
recommended
for
the
experience
but
i
probably
will
not
seek
it
out
agian
d
satisfying
ale
that
showcases
the
fresh
hops
and
wild
yeasts
of
the
belgian
countryside
its
not
one
id
like
every
day
but
its
an
excellent
sipper
now
and
then
near
the
top
of
the
heap
when
it
comes
to
the
evolving
belgian
ipa
style
d
very
drinkable
particularly
if
you
have
the
time
to
see
it
change
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
d
excellent
couldve
wouldve
just
didnt
have
another
too
swallow
definately
will
have
again
light
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
bit
of
yeasty
flavor
in
the
back
end
d
a
very
nice
version
of
the
style
hoppy
definitely
compared
to
a
belgian
pale
but
to
other
bipas
quite
light
the
flavours
are
real
good
a
definite
rebuy
i
had
previously
tasted
the
poperings
nunnebier
and
saw
this
on
the
beer
menu
at
a
philadelphia
belgian
tavern
i
decided
to
try
it
and
was
not
disappointed
they
served
it
from
the
bottle
in
the
appropriate
glass
it
looked
appealing
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
then
i
took
the
glass
to
my
lips
and
the
flavors
took
me
a
little
by
surprise
the
first
few
sips
were
malty
and
slightly
bitter
it
took
me
about
a
half
glass
to
get
used
to
the
originality
of
the
flavor
i
ordered
a
second
one
and
then
i
was
hooked
you
should
try
it
its
an
absolute
delight
poured
from
bottle
into
a
tulip
pours
a
very
pretty
light
orange
with
an
active
white
head
smells
of
light
citrus
hops
with
some
belgian
doughey
yeast
definitely
an
ipa
but
also
definitely
belgian
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
lots
of
sweet
hop
bitterness
some
grapefruit
and
orange
wit
a
spicy
kick
in
there
as
well
very
crisp
and
very
drinkable
wish
i
picked
up
a
few
more
of
these
the
drinkability
is
good
its
has
a
pleasant
unique
flavor
drinkability
is
very
decent
not
overwhelming
could
use
some
aging
but
if
you
have
the
time
and
money
to
do
so
check
it
out
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
the
benchmark
belgian
ipa
imho
a
great
balance
of
belgian
blonde
character
and
assertive
fresh
hops
in
aroma
and
flavor
and
not
just
bitterness
to
me
the
definitive
classic
of
the
style
regardless
of
what
piraat
may
claim
although
i
havent
had
one
of
those
in
several
years
either
again
only
on
draught
at
the
edge
will
have
to
revisit
soon
the
main
knock
on
the
drinkability
is
the
yeastiness
which
gets
a
bit
thick
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
which
is
not
something
i
recall
from
draught
mouthfeel
is
fairly
average
though
the
slight
carbonation
make
it
interesting
very
drinkable
beer
overall
very
refreshing
and
light
compared
to
most
of
the
other
beers
from
the
watou
area
d
probably
a
bit
too
stylish
for
my
tastes
other
than
having
one
but
i
definitely
having
at
least
one
to
experience
it
drinkability
pretty
good
one
of
the
most
impressiveappearing
beers
i
have
seen
served
in
a
tulip
it
was
an
orange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
there
was
a
thin
stream
of
carbonation
that
arose
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
which
persisted
the
entire
time
i
drank
the
beer
other
than
the
kudos
for
the
appearance
this
beer
was
only
a
little
bit
above
average
the
aroma
was
vaguely
fruity
and
floral
i
thought
the
taste
was
mostly
breadlike
with
only
a
hint
of
hops
pretty
good
beer
not
very
ipaish
deep
cloudy
blonde
appearance
with
a
fuzzy
head
that
retains
pretty
well
the
aroma
is
somewhat
phenolic
with
a
minty
kick
to
it
in
the
taste
its
not
very
hoppy
at
all
sweet
with
some
clove
and

hmm
still
not
many
hops
to
be
found
its
a
good
beer

it
doesnt

to
be

what
you

alcohol
is
moderate

are
simple

unimpressive
easy

lacking

d
i

it
just
didnt

on

levels
keeping
this
one
on
my
short
list
this
is
a
great
beer
and
it
brings
back
awesome
memories
thats
what
its
all
about
notes
a
bit
torn
about
this
one
it
has
its
qualities
but
is
fairly
flawed
overall
there
was
nothing
really
offensive
about
this
beer
nor
was
there
anything
particularly
memorable
except
for
that
slightly
metallic
and
earthy
taste
bottle
poured
into
a
orval
chalice
body
was
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
slight
white
head
but
solid
lacing
and
ring
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
nose
had
strong
citrus
and
grapefruit
hop
notes
the
taste
had
strong

and

notes
up

as
well

the
beer
is
well
rounded
and
dry
to
the
finish

sweet

very
sweet
residual

noticable
leaves
a
syrupy
taste
in
the
mouth
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
mostly
a
super
sweet
tripel
good
desert
beer
drinkability
is
decent
and
carbonation
is
lower
than
expected
d
not
really
a
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
slight
haze
has
a
huge
thick
white
head
and
nice
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
floral
and
herbal
reminded
me
dried
herbs
and
flowers
with
a
light
piney
note
in
the
background
the
taste
starts
with
a
light
grain
malt
character
with
hints
of
herbs
tickling
the
sides
of
your
tongue
the
finish
has
a
hint
of
piney
hops
and
then
goes
down
cool
and
refreshing
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
strong
golden
ale
with
a
taste
comes
a
rush
of
fresh
continental
hops
and
yeast
blended
to
grain
flavors
similar
to
fresh
french
baguette
straight
out
of
the
oven
caronation
helps
to
a
dryfeeling
finish
making
it
very
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
not
bad
note
to
self
try
it
again
sometime
i
would
consider
this
pretty
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
belgian
strong
pale
ale
more
than
anything
else
though
not
to
take
anything
away
from
this
great
brew
but
if
i
want
a
belgian
ipa
ill
first
reach
for
houblon
chouffe
great
beer
try
it
serving
size
330ml
bottle
poured
into
poperings
hommel
ale
glass
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
imho
the
benchmark
of
a
belgian
ipa
i
was
surprised
and
delighted
to
see
this
on
tap
at
many
establishments
in
belgium
i
certainly
imbibed
quite
a
few
drinkability
very
even
though
it
has
a
somewhat
high
abv
i
could
likely
drink
a
six
of
this
if
i
was
in
belgium
at
the
brewery
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
gold
with
some
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
very
unique
smooth
and
even
sweet
tone
though
not
over
done
mild
yeast
beneath
all
of
it
though
not
overpowering
it
all
flavor
is
totally
odd
not
your
typical
of
the
style
slightly
sweet
but
with
a
bitter
tone
and
a
strong
earthy
tone
that
hey
my
palate
just
isnt
experienced
enough
to
be
able
to
place
slight
alcohol
invasion
though
it
is
strong
in
a
unique
way
dry
edge
and
just
totally
interesting
if
you
want
something
different
to
try
this
is
one
for
ya
id
love
to
try
this
one
again
farther
down
my
beer
road
d
not
what
id
call
refreshing
in
any
sense
of
the
word
but
this
is
still
a
well
built
and
complex
if
a
bit
hoppy
belgian
ipa
body
is
medium
loosely
carbonated
and
airey
on
the
palate
with
a
slippery
smooth
texture
decent
but
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
pours
a
light
hazy
golden
amber
saison
color
with
a
delicate
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
less
forward
with
the
hops
than
some
belgian
ipas
and
seems
to
straddle
the
line
between
that
style
and
a
highly
hopped
saison
some
sweet
malts
compose
the
base
of
the
aroma
with
some
farmhouse
yeast
thrown
on
top
but
the
fruityminty
hops
are
a
great
topping
on
the
palate
smooth
malts
expertly
mixed
with
juicy
minty
hops
from
the
getgo
plus
a
wonderfully
full
bodied
yeast
element
that
grows
into
the
midpalate
the
finish
is
active
with
hops
and
yeast
and
envelops
the
palate
in
a
blanket
of
fruit
and
herb
flavors
delicious
mouthfeel
is
fully
carbonated
and
nicely
balanced
between
smooth
malts
and
some
rough
residual
hop
oils
overall
this
is
fantastic
stuff
i
dont
think
its
quite
hoppy
enough
to
be
a
belgian
ipa
but
regardless
of
the
category
this
is
a
tasty
balanced
expertly
executed
brew
more
please
hazy
pale
golden
with
a
really
foamy
white
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
tons
of
lace
smell
is
hoppy
but
not
as
hoppy
as
i
hoped
what
did
i
expect
from
a
belgian
beer
perfumy
minty
and
lemony
hops
ride
on
a
bready
malt
scent
that
is
just
barely
sweet
sweetness
is
faint
and
smells
like
unripe
pear
and
apple
hops
are
definitely
the
highlight
here
in
the
taste
department
reminds
me
of
herbal
lemon
mint
tea
riding
on
a
majic
pilsner
malt
carpet
just
a
hint
of
bitter
in
the
finish
the
medium
body
really
feels
medium
because
unlike
a
lot
of
bpas
this
one
is
not
supercarbonated
which
usually
gives
the
heavier
beers
a
lighter
feel
a
nice
beer
and
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
it
this
750ml
came
in
a
nice
tin
with
pictures
of
beer
and
hop
fields
on
it
i
just
fear
that
i
fell
prey
to
marketing
and
picked
it
up
for
the
tin
not
its
reputation
as
a
great
great
beer
fun
to
try
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
anytime
soon
give
me
a
chouffe
any
day
of
the
week
750
ml
green
corkncrown
bottle
best
before
a408
served
in
a
tulip
the
first
pour
reveals
a
translucent
orangeypeach
hue
with
lots
of
floaties
and
it
becomes
more
opaque
with
subsequent
pours
the
beer
has
medium
carbonation
and
two
inches
of
offwhite
head
that
deposits
lace
which
would
look
better
if
the
glass
were
spotless
and
if
i
werent
constantly
swirling
to
take
in
the
aroma
the
components
of
which
are
wonderful
noble
hops
spicyperfumy
and
greenpiney
notes
on
top
of
subdued
pale
malts
on
the
palate
there
is
a
toastybready
malt
base
but
this
is
quickly
overshadowed
by
a
substantial
perfumyfloral
and
piney
hop
dose
imparting
a
big
bitterness
that
increases
as
it
warms
but
never
overwhelms
there
are
also
medicinal
phenols
crisp
green
apple
and
hints
of
cork
on
top
of
a
nice
conditioned
mediumfull
body
that
has
lively
carbonation
from
start
to
end
and
leaves
a
medium
finish
i
love
these
hoppedup
belgians
and
this
is
a
fine
example
that
is
worth
revisiting
at
some
point
d
i
wouldnt
have
another
but
i
can
see
it
being
better
if
categorized
as
a
different
style
the
yeastiness
was
just
too
unpleasant
not
recommended
d
a
nice
beer
shame
its
so
hard
to
find
as
at
11
a
bottle
when
found
is
pretty
good
here
overall
an
outstanding
and
pretty
different
belgian
ipa
recommended
awesome
drinkability
as
with
most
belgians
the
flavor
is
not
very
powerful
or
overpowering
but
somewhat
light
and
balanced
i
will
have
to
get
more
of
this
beer
the
body
and
flavor
are
close
to
expectations
but
the
hop
presence
just
isnt
there
like
id
hoped
again
as
the
glass
shrinks
the
hops
show
more
and
more
id
love
a
750
of
this
still
an
excellent
all
around
beer
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
the
wow
beer
i
was
hoping
for
belgian
ipas
can
keep
their
tripel
characters
with
a
more
generous
dose
of
hops
foggy
golden
orange
beautiful
color
and
a
beautiful
head
too
tall
and
thick
becoming
clumpy
around
the
edges
and
leaving
generous
lacing
on
the
glass
flowery
peppery
hop
aromas
with
a
slight
sugar
cookie
maltiness
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
uncluttered
simple
herbal
hops
phenols
clean
dry
malts
honey
and
a
wellrounded
yeastiness
some
steely
qualities
here
and
there
but
no
big
deal
smooth
medium
body
very
mellow
in
many
aspects
a
little
grassy
in
the
aftertaste
tolerably
dry
and
moderately
bitter
laid
back
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
thirst
quenching
for
a
hot
summer
day
recommended
i
have
only
had
a
few
of
the
style
but
although
different
from
my
favorite
american
style
these
seem
to
have
found
a
niche
with
me
poured
into
a
small
tulip
glass
a
hazed
light
golden
with
big
blooming
head
leaving
globs
of

it
settled

slowly

and

easy
and
has

nice
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
amount

carbonation
and
a
dry
and
slightly
alcoholic
finish
really
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
a
nicely
crafted
ipa
which
is
a
bit
of
a
rarity
in
belgium
overall
a
very
impressive
brew
very
very
drinkable
i
look
forward
to
having
more
of
this
d
meh
this
beer
is
lacking
in
flavor
it
just
strikes
me
as
not
being
a
full
enough
flavor
more
like
water
with
additives
than
a
beer
i
dont
think
i
will
have
again

comming
to

a
little

here
along
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
first
taste
was
a
bit
metallic
but
this
subsides
yeasty
and
just
damn
good
slick
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
fine
brew
i
am
very
impressed
drinkability
even
though
im
pretty
disappointed
with
this
beer
its
still
good
certainly
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
all
the
hype
in
my
opinion
poured
into
a
hommel
tulip
goblet
pouring
a
nice
light
orangish
cloudy

with
a
nice
thick
fluffy

smells
of
sweet
malts
and
small
notes
of
hops
it
tastes
fantastic
a
bit
sweet
hiding
the
alcohol
notes
with
bitterness
i
guess
belgium
is
on
their
way
to
ipas
d
two
would
be
tops
for
me
on
this
one
overall
a
nice
brew
that
is

if
you
can
stand
the
initial

drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
the
hoppiness
makes
it
a
bit
distinct
from
others
of
that
country
also
a
good
balance
of
fruit
and
yeast
pleasant
if
not
the
most
fantastic
beer
for
the

id
definitely
buy
it
again
an
absolutely
wonderful

had

character
in
the
taste
along
with
nuanced

notes
along
with
a
very
nice
dry
finish
this
is
complex
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
crisp
theres
lots
of
carbonation
here
but
it
could
use
some
more
maybe
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
a
great
beer
this
is
my
first
belgian
ipa
review
i
am
totally
impressed
highly
recommended
drinkable
and
completely
forgettable
maybe
a
bit
past
its
prime
but
certainly
not
old
id
give
it
a
try
again
if
i
found
a
very
fresh
bottle
or
found
it
on
tap
d
off
the
chart
there
are
so
many
different
and
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
in
this
beer
almost
anyone
can
find
something
to
love
here
seriously
all
of
the
various
layers
of
this
beer
compliment
each
other
so

a
fine

nice

overall
a
fantastic
ale
its
got
all
the
qualities
of
a
graceful
triple
with
a
little
less
sweetness
thats
replaced
by
a
multi
dimensional
hop
ensemble
that
makes
this
ale
sing
its
quite
a
simple
and
subtle
hand
on
one
hand
yet
very
complex
and
ambiguous
on
the
other
whatever
face
its
wearing

im
in

with
it

a
complex
and
quite
different
belgian
ale
worth
trying
for
sure
overall
this
is
not
as
good
as
some
hoppy
belgians
chouffe
houblon
de
ranke
anything
but
this
still
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
beer
good
profile
the
whole
way
round
just
wish
is
was
cheaper
or
had
more
balls
either
or
really
mouthfeel
was
fizzy
with
a
body
falling
on
the
light
side
of
medium
very
nice
beer
this
brew
has
a
brilliant
white
head
filled
with
large
bubbles
and
a
longlived
consistency
the
beer
has
a
clean
and
slightly
sweet
smell
i
expected
a
more
pronounced
hop
aroma
given
the
label
theres
certainly
a
little
herbal
and
floral
hop
aroma
its
just
a
little
subdued
theres
a
little
citrus
yeast
and
certainly
a
little
caramel
in
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
clean
sweet
and
a
little
peppery
theres
some
yeast
and
a
little
fruit
as
well
the
spice
and
phenolic
character
stands
out
as
you
drink
this
brew
the
finish
is
a
little
more
hoppy
than
the
rest
of
the
brew
but
theres
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
this
is
an
interesting
and
straightforward
beer
the
hops
are
restrained
but
thats
okay
with
me
drinkability
this
is
good
but
not
great
this
beer
has
great
drinkabilty
despite
its
high
alcohol
content
its
pure
belgian
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
with
each
taste
to
be
lingered
on
and
pondered
i
definitely
want
to
try
this
one
again
before
i
return
to
the
u
s
as
where
i
live
beer
like
this
is
damn
hard
to
come
by
poured
from
the
330ml
capped
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
body
is
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
orange
highlights
topped
by
a
bubbly
stark
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
leaving
a
bit
of
pretty
lacing
in
its
wake
aroma
of
sweet
euro
malt
herby
belgian
yeast
and
spicy
euro
hops
notes
of
pineapple
grass
and
a
touch
of
clove
peek
through
palate
is
mainly
semisweet
lightly
fruity
pale
malt
with
a
muted
presence
of
euro
hops
and
a
touch
of
grass
hanging
around
somewhere
in
there
body
is
substantial
enough
to
firmly
hold
the
alcohol
content
but
can
be
foamy
on
the
swallow
if
youre
not
careful
i
dont
know
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
beer
not
bad
but
not
something
ill
go
for
very
frequently
a
nice
diversion
from
the
norm
light
and
easy
to
drink
will
enjoy
more
of
these
in
the
future
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
is
just
that
much
better
on
tap
or
if
my
palate
was
just
happier
making
the
adjustment
from
the
duchess
to
this
vs
coming
in
clean
but
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
despite
the
initial
attack
of
alcohol
and
pine
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavor
doesnt
really
suit
my
tastes
overall
a
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
brew
i
had
expected
more
flavor
and
complexity
from
a
belgian
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
well
maybe
not
as
great
as
i
remember
but
in
any
event
this
and
watou
triple
are
2
great
beers
imho
more
hops
than
im
used
to
in
a
belgian
and
though
i
loved
xx
bitter
i
didnt
take
to
this
one
quite
the
same
ill
definitely
need
to
try
another
the
head
is
white
and
fairly
thick
color
is
cloudy
and
brownish
gray
the
lacing
is
strong
the
smell
is
fruity
sour
has
apple
and
a
slight
lemon
and
wheaty
body
taste
is
a
lemony
sour
thats
not
too
sour
a
little
wheaty
and
a
little
bitter
feels
very
carbonated
and
not
too
impressive
overall
it
was
ok
to
try
and
i
could
get
used
to
it
but
its
too
expensive
to
get
used
to
it
right
now
the
taste
contained
a
little
hop
bitterness
that
combined
with
the
sour
yeast
carbonation
was
light
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
of
a
punch
with
this
strong
belgian
pale
ale
its
an
interesting
although
maybe
not
great
combination
of
flavors
present
in
this
pale
ale
wouldnt
call
it
bad
though
i
would
have
it
again
overall
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
ale
its
just
a
bit
too
light
for
my
liking
it
is
a
good
beer
however
but
far
from
the
best
yet
another
beer
that
gives
me
reason
to
hold
the
belgians
on
a
pedestal
above
all
others
and
one
of
the
more
unusual
ones
considering
its
very
hopped
up
yet
also
a
few
steps
leftofcenter
from
the
typical
hoppy
beers
we
know
and
love
250
ml
bottle
bought
in
frederikshavn
denmark
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
colour
large
head
nice
hoppy
aroma
some
yeasty
and
wheaty
notes
too
hints
of
citrus
and
pineapple
flavour
has
dominant
hoppy
notes
but
not
much
else
relatively
tart
and
bitter
finish
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
refreshing
beer
despite
its
strength
this
a
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
even
with
a
high
abv
poured
from
bottle
to
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
thick
white
head
that
lingered
with
good
lacing
throughout
the
glass
aroma
was
a
mix
of
floral
and
clover
with
hints
of
fruit
maybe
oranges
taste
somewhat
spicy
at
first
and
the
7
5
alcohol
was
well
hidden
as
beer
warmed
at
midglass
taste
became
more
honey
sweet
had
a
good
finish
surprisingly
good
smooth
tasty
beer
cool
stuff
maybe
not
worth
3
50
per
bottle
when
i
can
get
a
more
flavorful
st
bernardus
tripel
at
that
price
but
nice
anyway
drinkability
topnotch
great
belgian
flavors
but
the
dry
hoppiness
removes
any
cloying
sweetness
or
syrupy
heaviness
liked
it
the
mouthfeel
smooths
as
it
warms
a
bit
lots
of
body
for
a
pale
and
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
that
warms
gently
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
solid
belgian
strong
pale
ale
thats
a
treat
for
sure
very
very
crisp
and
pepperydry
is
that
a
hint
of
cumin
this
makes
a
nice
quaff
along
side
moules
and
a
a
wellspiced
steak
frites
theres
an
awful
lot
to
like
about
this
beer
another
beer
purchased
in
belfast
me
pours
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
a
thick
head
that
vanishes
slowly
smells
a
bit
citrusy
tastes
quite
different
like
dried
fruit
hops
a
bit
of
citrus
a
lot
less
sweet
than
ive
had
from
other
belgians
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
a
little
thin
but
not
watery
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
differnt
tasting
belgian
ale
only
1
99
a
bottle
must
get
more
soon
clean
and
refreshing
quite
impressive
this
is
consistently
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
ales
whether
from
a
tap
or
bottle
d
goes
down
easily
but
id
choose
several
other
beers
in
the
style
first
ill
try
it
again
at
a
later
date
the
mouthfeel
was
bitter
and
dry
at
first
and
faded
into
a
watery
and
bland
feel
mild
carbonation
at
first
and
none
later
takehome
message
this
ended
up
bitter
and
very
sour
therefore
drinkability
was
kinda
limited
poured
nicely
into
tulip
glass
nice
1
head
stuck
around
for
a
whilehuge
bubbles
pleasant
orange
color
aroma
was
nearly
nonexistant
good
mix
of
citrus
and
spices
just
a
light
flavorful
touch
interesting
and
sour
mouthfeel
a
good
beer
nothing
great
or
special
though
worth
a
try
easy
drinking

this
beer
pours
a
semi
hazy
orangish
yellow
color
with
a
medium
foamy
head
moderate
lacing
and
head
maintains
quite
well
aroma
is
belgian
spices
and
bitter
flowers
some
yeast
funk
for
sure
citrus
and
honey
round
it
out
i
can
tell
im
going
to
enjoy
this
beer
taste
follows
suit
i
get
some
of
those
bitter
estery
hoppy
flavors
right
away
they
maintain
themselves
nicely
and
provide
a
good
balance
to
every
other
flavor
that
comes
and
goes
english
toffee
pears
grapefruit
bananas
cloves
yeasty
funk
it
seems
to
come
in
that
order
and
the
flavors
will
mix
and
then
one
gets
cut
out
alcohol
comes
towards
the
end
and
drives
right
through
the
hops
and
yeast
nice
little
acidic
finish
rounds
out
the
experience
this
beer
has
a
semibitter
but
moreso
hoppy
base
and
sweeter
flavors
on
top
until
the
end
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
succession
medium
body
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
lively
mouthfeel
exceptionally
drinkable
i
would
like
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
this
and
la
fin
du
monde
highly
recommended
750ml
caged
and
corked
watch
those
eyes
very
wit
beirish
i
smell
and
taste
citrus
and
corriander
mixed
a
nice
hoppy
taste
full
head
that
lasted
through
half
the
beer
and
then
dissapated
to
a
nice
ring
around
the
rim
with
a
fine
lace
across
the
top
there
is
a
lot
to
this
beer
and
i
am
happy
i
have
tried
it
definitely
worth
another
look
or
two
from
notes
poured
a
brilliant
copper
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
sat
nicely
over
top
of
the
beer
through
the
drink
nose
was
spicey
noble
hop
over
a
light
spun
sugar
and
caramel
sweetness
that
i
thought
really
worked
well
together
flavor
was
light
orange
cirtus
and
spun
sugar
sweetness
with
a
solid
balance
of
herbal
and
spicey
hop
excellent
balance
and
very
clean
feel
was
moderate
with
an
amazingly
fine
carbonation
that
led
to
a
silky
smoothenss
that
i
really
liked
i
found
drinkability
to
be
excellent
balance
was
great
and
the
noble
hop
character
really
worked
well
in
this
one
id
like
to
see
more
hoppy
beers
made
with
this
hop
profile
surprised
that
its
taken
me
til
now
to
try
this
brew
a
perfect
summertime
refresher
a
lot
of
bold
witbierlike
flavors
with
the
wheat
corriander
orange
lemon
and
bublegum
flavors
and
soft
velvetey
texture
all
this
with
that
belgian
tart
twant
lightly
sour
musky
earthy
and
spicy
much
complexity
for
such
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
very
clean
and
crisp
ill
be
drinking
this
one
often
the
taste
is
fine
not
as
good
as
i
remember
but
better
than
the
smell
woul
indicate
hopefully
i
can
have
this
on
draft
again
soon
lucky
baldwins
belgian
beer
festival
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
goes
down
easy
and
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
i
wouldnt
complain
if
this
was
produced
in
750ml
bottles
a
hoppy
belgian
brew
thats
well
worth
tracking
down
and
trying
get
this
now
if
you
even
just
remotely
like
bpas
wicked
good
and
shows
belgianstyle
brewers
not
to
fear
the
hops
with
this
beer
it
seems
that
the
hops
serve
mostly
to
provide
bitterness
rather
than
flavor
this
is
fine
since
the
belgians
are
rather
adept
at
dosing
their
brews
with
all
manner
of
interesting
and
harmonious
flavor
elements
in
the
case
of
poperings
hommel
im
glad
to
see
that
van
eecke
has
managed
to
combing
strong
focused
bitterness
with
fruit
spice
and
a
lingering
sweetness
resulting
in
a
most
enjoyable
everevolving
beer
out
of
the
bottle
pours
a
pale
golden
orange
in
color
with
a
good
thick
lasting
rocky
head
a
little

good
belgian

in

crisp
hops
in
the
mouth
but
not
bitter
belgian
yeast
alcohol

theres
some

this
beer
came
in
330
ml
brown
bottle
with
a
notched
in
best
by
date
of
april
2006
after
popping
the
cap
i
immediately
noticed
how
active
the
carbonation
was
as
the
beer
formed
a
head
in
the
bottle
neck
after
pouring
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
the
head
was
tall
and
crowning
similar
to
duvel
with
the
underlying
beer
clear
golden
pale
amber
in
color
but
clouded
up
after
the
yeast
introduction
the
aroma
was
rather
mild
with
sweet
fruity
malt
banana
peach
sugar
earthy
yeast
and
spicy
and
floral
hops
the
taste
was
exactly
as
initially
indicated
by
the
nose
with
the
malt
sugar
yeast
and
hops
in
a
delicate
balance
taste
was
like
a
concentrated
witbier
with
above
average
level
of
hops
celery
and
pepper
like
spicy
hints
in
the
aftertaste
alcohol
was
quite
well
hidden
which
made
it
much
easier
to
drink
than
most
other
7
5
abv
beers
a
subtle
and
sneaky
pleasure
well
suited
for
a
hot
summer
day
tasted
like
it
smells
with
a
hint
of
hops
but
well
balanced
with
the
spiced
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
a
graindry
finish
killer
this
would
be
a
great
daily
type
beer
its
complex
enough
to
keep
your
interest
time
and
time
again
very
smooth
no
harshness
whatsoever
like
most
imports
the
price
can
be
too
much
for
daily
consumption
at
3
50
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
highly
recomended
if
you
can
find
it
large
bottle
caged
and
corked
that
my
wife
returned
from
belgium
with
nice
job
this
one
opens
with
a
burst
of
energy
and
pours
with
the
same
spirit
spritsy
and
livley
light
apricot
in
color
and
yeasty
cloudy
the
large
head
is
snow
white
dissolving
to
a

leaving

but
slippery
lacing
nose
here
is
citrusy
and
maybe
a
hint
of
pepper
this
is
a
fine
yeasty
lemony
tasty
and
lively
brew
fruity
and
crisp
up
front
and
then
balanced
by
citric
drying
hops
yum
fine
summer
sipper
well
worth
a
try
note
the
label
for
englishspeaking
europe
says
poperings
hommel
beer
as
apposed
to
hommel
ale
shown
in
ba
picture
otherwise
the
same
label
poperings
hommel
bier
is
different
and
is
a
better
beer
for
it
the
hops
play
a
much
more
prominent
role
than
they
do
in
most
bspas
of
course
to
a
hophead
that
means
that
its
in
perfect
balance
i
had
a
good
time
with
this
one
and
will
be
sure
to
look
for
it
again
this
would
be
a
perfect
hoppy
saison
actually
yum
mouthfeel
is
great
carbonation
doesnt
interfere
and
the
initial
smoothness
is
very
deceptive
with
regards
to
carbonation
drinkability
should
go
down
because
of
high
alcohol
content
but
really
this
is
a
marvellously
enjoyable
brew
three
hoorahs
for
belgiums
hoppy
beers
pours
a
dark
golden
color
that
never
seems
to
settle
with
a
generous
head
smell
is
tasty
like
grapes
and
a
touch
of
sweet
fruits
the
taste
is
also
really
pleasant
hoppy
is
the
best
way
to
describe
it
there
is
also
a
touch
of
sourness
like
grapefruits
or
wine
even
though
it
is
paler
than
most
belgians
it
is
really
enjoyable
and
easy
going
there
is
a
slight
peppery
sensation
at
the
very
end
of
the
beer
that
really
makes
it
nessisary
for
another
sip
this
beer
pours
from
the
tap
into
a
proper
glass
looking
all
golden
yellow
clumpy
settled
wispy
foam
layers
and
layers
of
sticky
lacing
are
present
before
i
have
a
chance
to
drink
and
its
not
going
anywhere
almost
no
carbonation
in
this
beer
still
appears
beautiful
in
the
chicago
sunlight
smells
sweetly
malted
with
candi
sugar
very
belgian
the
famous
belgian
hops
dont
come
through
in
the
nose
but
provide
a
nice
bitter
twang
in
the
flavor
the
hops
help
to
counteract
a
tart
lemon
and
heavy
blonde
maltiness
this
beer
finishes
smooth
nice
for
the
afternoon
mild
lingering
bitterness
is
nice
for
something
called
poperinge
this
is
rather
nice
it
probably
wont
appeal
to
a
belgian
beer
newbie
as
its
a
little
too
sharp
tasting
for
someone
whose
only
experiece
is
with
say
duvel
not
knocking
duvel
its
just
a
little
easier
on
the
palate
than
this
though
it
will
never
replace
st
bernardus
abt
12
as
my
alltime
favorite
belgian
beer
i
quite
like
it
mouthfeeldrinkabilty
not
bad
wouldnt
mind
having
another
d
this
is
a
nice
peppy
beer
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
bold
fruit
flavors
but
the
multiple
flavors
are
faint
compared
to
the
spiciness
i
would
like
to
see
a
hint
of
malt
or
alcohol
round
out
this
beer
and
give
it
a
little
more
depth
got
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
which
presented
the
beer
in
its
own
glass
nice
touch
this
hazy
golden
ale
had
a
wonderful
bright
white
delicate
head
of
foam
with
lots
of
facing
and
an
intense
herbal
aroma
that
was
hard
to
describe
a
combination
of
smells
some
mint
some
woody
hop
spice
maybe
even
a
slight
hint
of
eucalyptus
it
actually
reminded
me
of
the
the
combination
of
smells
that
indundate
the
sense
whenever
i
walk
in
the
the
apothecary
shop
my
wife
likes
to
visit
i
almost
enjoyed
the
aroma
more
than
the
flavor
of
this
beer
i
couldnt
keep
my
nose
out
of
my
glass
the
flavor
of
this
beer
echoed
the
aroma
in
some
respect
lots
of
sort
of
vaguely
herbal
flavors
backed
up
by
a
crisp
maltiness
but
nothing
that
i
could
really
pin
down
i
like
this
sort
of
complexity
in
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
absolutely
silken
and
the
body
was
just
about
right
overall
a
very
drinkable
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
would
have
downed
faster
if
hadnt
been
for
the
wonderful
aroma
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
little
better
than
average
but
not
deserving
of
some
of
the
more
enthousiastic
previous
reviews

into
a

it

a
very
light
copper
color
with
three
heaping
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the

the
smell
is
very
spicy
and
very
hoppy
lots
of
pepper
and
even
some
funk
under
a
bed
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
odd
some
spices
stick
out
like
pepper
and
ginger
then
theres
the
hops
which
give
it
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
theres
a
touch
of
funk
to
the
taste
as
well
on
the
finish
its
very
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
frisky
on
the
tongue
with
good
carbonation
and
thickness
the
drinkability
is
good
for
a
7
5
brew
as
well
a
unique
beer
that
everyone
must
try
at
least
once
i
could
spend
paragraphs
just
describing
the
funky
shriveled
white
morel
head
that
floats
upon
the
surface
of
this

ill
spare
the

readerif
there

to
be

the

the

before
the
velvety

washes
across
the

bringing
a
wave
of
maple
sap
supped
from
autumn
leaf
soothing
and
sensual
and
now
a
clot
of
foam
has
dislodged
from
the
liquid
to
adhere
on

i

there
is
something

ontap
at

it

in

i
could

and
i
think
after
i
bought
the
case
blind
today
at
the
beer
yard
im
not
going
to
be
shy
about
hitting
several
of
these
up
tomorrow
on
xmas
eve
drinkability
may
have
to
try
another
one
of
these
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
one
otherwise
a
decent
beer
with
a
bit
of
an
odd
taste
the
7
5
abv
was
non
existent
scary
drinkability
that
was
only
hindered
by
the
sweetness
great
job
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
to
a
steady
film
that
coated
the
glass
the
smell
was
fruity
and
spicy
and
malty
the
taste
was
sweet
and
sugary
with
some
spice
coriander
a
bit
of
hoppiness
and
a
good
malty
backbone
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
modest
carbonation
the
aftertaste
was
hoppy
with
a
sweet
fruitiness
this
was
an
interesting
beer
a
beer
from
which
you
can
drink
more
then
one
and
always
a
good
choice
in
a
bar
not
having
the
absolute
hoptouch
though
wich
it
gives
on
the

spiciness
to

with
a

boquet
moderatefull
in
the
mouth
slightly
creamy
in
texture
but
wellcarbonated
the
pale
malt
has
a
restrained
fruitiness
which
emerges
with
warmth
midpalate
develops
a
slightly
bready
character
which
when
combined
with
the
spicy
finish
gives
this
beer
just
the
slightest
hint
of
a
gingerbread
cookie
character
nicely
bitter
finish
spicy
hops
with
hints
of
orange
peel
a
fine

medium
in
body
and
seems
to
grow
as
it
warms
its
a
bit
gooey
towards
the
finish
though
its
airy
otherwise
nonetheless
this
is
a
fine
drinkable
ale
with
a
good
amount
of
flair
taste
went
down
really
crisp
with
a
little
coriander
and
maybe
cumin
and
a

this
is
about
the
hops
they
arent
overpowering
but
they
are
the
main
point
of
this
beer
some
bitter
citrus
notes
quite
enjoyable
and
quite
unlike
most
belgians
i
have
had
this
on
several
occasions
and
i
note
that
sometimes
i
like
it
and
sometimes
it
does
not
grab
me
i
think
this
one
is
either
an
aqcuired
taste
or
is
very
sensitive
to
ones
moodconditions
when
trying
it
but
i
do
recommend
it
if
you
can
find
it
pours
a
lightly
hazy
gold
color
and
is
topped
by
an
off
white
head
quite
a
floral
aroma
with
notes
of
various
herbs
and
spices
all
of
which
seems
to
be
hop
derived
the
beer
is
sharp
and
bitter
with
herbal
grassy
hop
notes
in
the
flavor
i
get
notes
of
bergamot
hay
and
a
hint
of
honey
in
the
finish
it
is
like
a
belgian
ipa
it
is
light
bodied
with
lots
of
good
hop
character
definitely
a
tasty
beer
i
was
highly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
had
it
on
tap
at
monks
in
philadelphia
and
brought
home
a
couple
of
bottles
to
try
if
the
bottles
drag
down
the
score
ill
come
back
and
rerate
the
aroma
is
strongly
floral
its
like
gardenias
minus
the
sickeningly
sweet
aspect
theres
a
good
bit
of
orange
fruit
mixed
in
and
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
color
is
a
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
stiff
white
head
overall
impression
this
is
the
fifth
beer
out
of
an
8pack
two
of
them
so
far
have
been
a
bit
skunky
not
sure
why
because
they
are
in
brown
glass
its
a
good
beer
though
and
a
great
loveletter
to
the
flavor
of
the
hop
sort
of
realaleish
a
fine
dense
head
on
a
beautiful
scintillating
golden
copper
color
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
and
medicinal
with
hints
of
weed
the
taste
reveals
the
floral
aspect
of
the
hops
very
thick
but
that
leave
a
dry
finish
yeasty
the
beer
doesnt
have
the
sweet
notes
that
are
often
found
in
strong
pale
ales
light
hints
of
citrus
too
the
hops
are
very
persistent
in
the
mouth
but
in
an
interesting
way
a
remarkable
brew
this
is
a
very
good
brew
reminding
me
of
a
hybrid
between
a
lambic
and
a
belgian
golden
the
cardboard
and
tannins
hurt
its
drinkability
however
its
still
quite
enjoyable
this
seems
more
properly
labeled
a
lambic
as
it
tastes
spontaneously
fermented
750
poured
at
delirium
cafe
in
brussels
this
is
a
nice
golden
colour
with
a
big
fluffy
head
of
white
foam
aromas
are
excellent
and
consist
of
freshly
cut
medicinalherbal
hops
light
bready
malts
and
other
belgian
yeasts
sugars
and
spices
the
taste
is
hoppy
up
front
with
a
nice
malt
precense
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
a
medicinal
finish
that
is
herbal
yet
not
astringent
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
is
very
very
good
hazy
peachyhoney
hue
the
white
head
was
rocky
and
massive
it
reached
an
apex
of
two
and
a
half
fingers
in
height
the
head
was
a
solid
as
concrete
it
took
a
long
moment
to
fade
to
half
of
its
peak
height
the
subsequent
lacing
was
minimal
that
is
disappointing
visually
this
is
an
impressive
ale
the
aromas
are
very
lively
pears
apples
a
hint
of
fig
raisins
orange
zest
lemon
grass
and
a
pinch
of
pepper
the
nose
is
impressive
and
inviting
the
palate
seems
a
bit
lackluster
in
comparison
to
the
bouquet
it
needs
to
be
noted
my
bottle
is
a
few
years
old
best
by
0102
and
maybe
the
hoppiness
has
died
a
little
the
remaining
flavors
are
pleasant
it
just
lacks
oomph
it
is
very
dry
like
orval
with
pear
fruitiness
apples
too
a
little
bit
of
lemon
grass
in
the
middle
some
candy
sugar
sweetness
and
a
hint
just
a
hint
of
bread
the
alcohol
punch
supplies
some
flavor
and
a
little
warmth
to
the
belly
the
aftertaste
is
a
dull
mix
of
sweetness
and
pepper
this
is
a
tasty
beverage
it
seems
to
be
a
little
under
reviewed
and
under
appreciated
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
and
ordinary
the
carbonation
is
big
and
full
as
to
be
expected
medium
in
body
this
is
also
highly
drinkable
and
quite
devilish
considering
the
abv
of
7
5
the
legend
of
duvel
strikes
again
i
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
locally
i
purchased
this
11
2ounce
bottle
in
iowa
city
i
want
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
in
the
future
this
one
has
aged
very
gracefully
but
id
like
to
do
a
comparison
drinkability
is
high
eve
though
i
cant
really
place
this
beer
in
specific
style
11
2
ounce
bottle
golden
in

with
a
billowy
large
bubble
head
that
settles
slowly
leaving
a
weak
lace
aroma
is
of
citrus
light
hops
and
fruity
esters
taste
is
quite
hoppy
for
a
belgian
with
strong
traditional
belgianhop
flavor
that
lingers
throughout
malt
base
is
sweet
overall
im
quite
pleased
coming
from
the
hop
capital
of
belgium
i
didnt
expect
this
brew
to
be
so
well
balanced
far
from
straightforward
a
european
beer
this
hoppy
is
strange
to
taste
especially
when
it
is
hoppy
in
an
american
way
yet
its
yeast
and
malt
backbone
are
undeniably
belgian
phenomenal
with
food
for
me
its
always
a
great
pick
at
monks
cafe

it
is

i
enjoyed
it

this
is
a
very
dry
ale
has
a
sort
of
champagne
like
quality
to
it
the
yeasts
and
the
carbonation
are
the
major
focus
of
this
beer
a
touch
of
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
never
having
this
before
i
figured
i
would
try
the
belgian
beer
labelled
as
a
pale
with
plenty
of
hops
the
beer
was
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
wispy
head
there
was
a
great
floral
aroma
with
some
citrus
lingering
around
the
first
taste
blew
me
away
with
the
fine
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
both
lasted
pleasantly
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
and
then
mellowed
slowly
away
my
second
taste
seemed
even
better
as
my
brain
was
realizing
this
is
an
incredibly
perfected
hopped
pale
ale
this
is
a
must
try
on
tap
for
anyone
that
can
find
it
i
had
two
which
eliminated
another
belgian
selection
for
the
evening
but
i
didnt
care
poperings
the
region
in
belgium
where
they
grow
hops
this
beer
dated
best
before
0903
should
be
pretty
good
for
a
connoiseur
of
ipas
and
other
hoppy
styles
as
well
as
belgian
lovers
only
expect
belgian
in
the
mix
of
the
flavors
hence
its
roots
malty
yeasty
hoppy
and
musty
all
describe
this
beer
clear
and
orangy
pilsener
gold
color
with
a
puffy
rocky
white
head
that
lasts
in
the
tulip
glass
very
lemony
peppery
vinous
aroma
once
the
entire
contents
sediment
and
all
is
in
the
mix
the
color
becomes
a
hazier
orange
hue
the
hops
are
beautiful
in
this
beer
zesty
and
zippy
and
i
think
they
are
subsued
so
well
by
the
offset
of
the
malt
blood
orange
sweetness
interlaced
with
a
gingery
dryness
that
leaves
you
wanting
the
next
sip
ive
had
this
beer
on
draft
and
in
the
bottle
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
ales
i
miss
it
being
on
draft
a
nice
belgian
in
every
sense
the
nice
balance
of
hops
and
grain
combined
with
the
definite
presence
of
the
belgian
yeast
creates
what
is
the
prototype
for
this
style
huge
bready
aroma
and
bubbly
palette
it
finishes
rather
nicely
with
dry
bite
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
is
just
starting
to
get
into
belgians
gotta
throw
out
some
props
to
longbeachbum
for
sending
this
one
my
way
though
thanks
thanks
to
pintofale
big
thanks
hazy
gold
with
yeasty
bits
floating
about
it
pours
with
a
relatively
light
head
compared
to
some
other
beglians
in
addition
to
some
pleasant
fruit
aromas
and
some
spice
hops
are
quite
assertive
a
nice
applepear
flavor
asserts
itself
up
front
with
the
hops
again
making
their
presence
known
along
with
that
funky
beglian
musty
flavor
the
mix
is
a
bit
surprising
but
comes
together
well
it
really
fills
the
mouth
and
drinks
easily
for
the
style
and
abv
appears
a
golden
tone
with
an
orange
tint
along
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
for
a
belgium
i
must
say
there
is
a
very
full
floral
hop
aroma
mixed
with
spices
and
hints
of
the
belgium
yeast
used
here
i
am
falling
in
love
with
this
beer
with
each
sip
taste
is
a
perfect
balance
of
flavors
going
on
with
herbal
spices
and
musty
yeast
tones
and
the
sweetness
characteristic
of
most
belgiums
mixed
with
tones
of
caramel
finished
off
with
a
healthy
amount
of
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
beer
that
dances
on
the
palate
with
a
high
carbonation
leaving
a
smile
on
my
face
drinkability
is
amazing
just
watch
out
for
this
one
at
7
5
it
could
get
you
without
even
noticing
medium
body
and
lovely
mouthfeel
extaordinarily
easy
to
drink
and
the
most
dangerous
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
brilliantly
clear
golden
hue
when
decanted
off
the
yeast
effervescent
champagne
esque
prodigious
streams
of
bubbles
support
a
sea
foam
like
thick
billowy
airy
white
head
that
collapses
slowly
into
a
rugged
stiff
layer
that
leaves
dense
muddled
lace
sweet
ripe
pear
and
tangerine
esters
upfront
in
aroma
followed
by
mildly
earthy
hops
and
must
granny
smith
apple
acetaldehyde
adds
a
tart
contrast
sugary
honeydew
and
mellow
alcohol
spice
emerge
as
the
beer
breathes
enticingly
aromatic
unique
yet
soft
on
the
nose
a
pleasure
to
inhale
mild
honeyish
sweetness
is
perceived
at
first
in
flavor
then
is
ensued
by
a
combination
of
sugar
dusted
lemon
and
juicy
melon
sweetness
is
then
tapered
by
both
mild
hop
bitterness
and
drying
peppery
ethanol
subtle
floral
and
ripe
fruit
melange
mid
palate
lends
a
perfume
laced
sweetness
light
in
body
and
perhaps
a
bit
underwhelming
on
the
palate
very
well
attenuated
perhaps
due
to
the
copious
use
of
sucrose
hop
and
fruit
character
fades
late
leaving
an
lingering
extension
of
simple
residual
sweetness
to
fill
the
near
void
finishes
sweet
thin
and
lightly
peppery
hommel
is
a
unique
enjoyable
brew
that
starts
out
rich
and
multi
faceted
in
character
but
slowly
peters
out
to
finish
lackluster
nonetheless
taken
altogether
this
is
a
fine
beer
well
worth
a
try
a
fine
looking
nebulous
golden
orange
color
on
the
pour
the
head
is
modest
creamy
and
an
off
white
in
color
the
lace
left
behind
a
nice
coating
on
the
glass
with
lots
of
dross
floating
around
in
the
beer

quite
evident

a
delicate

the

dry
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
a
quite
quaffable
beer
pours
a
cloudy
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
settles
to
a
good
12
inch
then
slowly
fades
to
a
14
inch
the
lacing
is
thick
and
barely
leaves
any
glass
showing
very
slight
aroma
of
sweet
fruits
and
spices
the
first
sip
is
creamy
very
smooth
the
carbonation
produces
an
unbelievable
amount
of
tiny
bubbles
enticing
on
the
tongue
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
hoppy
spicey
finish
that
suits
me
quite
well
thank
you
a
hoppy
belgian
very
different
very
good
very
drinkable
as
always
much
better
as
it
warms
pours
with
a
thick
frothy
head
matched
with
a
cloudy
gold
texture
the
grassy
odor
is
strong
you
could
smell
this
from
miles
away
wow
this
was
a
lot
smoother
than
i
anticipated
its
hard
not
to
appreciate
the
delicate
balance
of
malt
and
unique
hops
it
finishes
sugary
yet
not
too
sweet
absolutely
a
fantastic
brew
pale
straw
color
white

and

the

is
lasting
as
as
well
as
its
lace
effects
pungent
hop
light

nose
medium

upfront
smack
you
in
the
face
malt
taste
which
is
followed
by
a
wave
of
crispy

hop
flowers
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
very
hoppy
belgian
since
it
is
made
in
the
hop
growing
area
of
belgium
poperings
i
would
consider
it
their
tribute
to
the
hops
well
maybe
anyway
it
is
wonderful
and
has
a
persistant
hop
presence
it
is
very
drinkable
and
with
its
medium
body
and
well
rounded
flavor
i
could
drink
them
all
day
drinkability
notes
first
off
this
gets
to
be
a
beeradvocate
pick
this
is
an
odd
ball
of
the
bunch
as
far
as
belgians
go
being
the
amount
of
hop
character
that
is
there
i
for
one
love
it
last
trip
to
belgium
i
quaffed
many
of
these
in
antwerp
and
could
not
get
enough
not
heavy
or
alcoholic
tasting
there
is
a
finely
drawn
outline
of
dusty
spices
especially
white
pepper
that
surrounds
red
delicious
apple
citrus
pith
and
parsley
flavors
as
it
warms
honey
stones
pie
crust
baked
apples
and
dried
apricot
flavors
emerge
the
finish
is
incredibly
long
and
leans
in
a
dry
herbal
direction
as
it
suggests
peppery
nasturtium
flowers
and
kind
bud
terrific
stuff
a
great
beer
ambassador
for
the
hopgrowing
area
within
west
flanders
i
find
i
prefer
it
on
draft
if
you
ever
get
chance
try
it
from
the
tap
deep
in
its
homeland
at
the
palace
hotel
in
poperinge
then
have
a
hopflavored
genever
to
finish
with
a
light
golden
haze
in
color
with
a
smell
of
spices
but
after
my
first
sip
i
tasted
carmel
with
a
pleasant
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
together
the
bitter
after
taste
was
not
overpowering
i
would
try
this
beer
again
this
beer
poured
a
nice
light
golden
color
and
formed
a
nice
white
head
that
left
some
nice
lace
a
lot
of
carbonation
that
is
common
in
this
style
an
aroma
of
citrus
and
hops
a
taste
of
hops
and
citrus
with
some
foamy
aspects
probably
due
to
the
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
finish
could
be
better
sweetish
at
the
start
with
bitter
hoppiness
at
the
finish
i
kind
of
liked
this
beer
very
drinkable
especially
at
7
5
alc
bit
of
added
spice
in
there
aswell
a
rare
hoppy
belgian
beer
sweeter
than
an
orval
and
stronger
at
7
5
liken
this
to
a
hoppy
triple
but
easier
to
drink
and
more
refreshing
poperings
is
a
hop
region
and
this
brew
is
obviously
blessed
by
its
local
hops
the
area
is
known
for
its
role
as
one
of
the
largest
battle
fields
in
the
world
wars
so
i
was
told
when
in
belgium
i
found
my
summer
ipa
a
fine
hybrid
of
ipa
and
a
belgian
wit
very
interesting
combination
of
styles
another
beer
that
i
would
guess
the
style
but
is
really
good
this
one
does
not
have
the
amount
of
hops
that
i
typically
associate
with
a
belgian
ipa
what
it
does
have
is
a
big
burst
of
fruit
and
juiciness
taste
is
peach
coriander
wheat
belgian
spices
and
slight
earthy
hops
at
the
end
all
of
the
flavors
seem
to
pop
a
very
light
and
semisweet
beer
this
is
one
i
could
drink
several
of
especially
as
it
gets
warmer
really
well
done
lightly
yeasty
with
a
nice
crisp
citrusy
finish
a
beer
i
could
sit
on
the
porch
on
a
sunny
day
drinking
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
wheatipa
taste
this
beer
poured
a
nice
opaque
gold
with
about
a
half
a
finger
of
head
and
persistent
lacing
this
was
an
approachable
belgian
ale
not
overly
sweet
or
acerbic
but
balanced
with
a
refreshing
but
astringent
impact
on
the
palate
and
a
moderate
mouthcoating
feel
the
aroma
isnt
strong
more
characteristic
of
a
belgian
not
at
all
piney
or
hoppy
thoughts
of
lemon
white
raisins
coriander
and
mild
cloves
are
evoked
ipa
seems
a
misnomer
to
even
call
it
a
pale
ale
is
generous
but
regardless
of
genre
it
was
an
enjoyable
and
very
refreshing
brew
it
was
good
maybe
it
was
just
a
good
batch
i
dunno
but
never
mind
what
haters
say
it
was
good
o
worth
a
try
but
would
be
better
if
the
hops
were
more
forward
i
would
classify
this
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
not
an
ipa
a
refreshing
break
from
many
of
todays
over
hopped
ipas
lots
of
flavor
drinkable
year
round
great
flavor
lighter
in
color
taste
is
slightly
fruity
but
flavorful
feel
very
smooth
texture
and
easy
drinking
closest
thing
to
matilda
ive
had
so
far
i
really
had
only
tried
one
white
ipa
before
but
most
any
beers
from
deschutes
are
worth
a
shot
plus
it
was
on
tap
at
happy
hour
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
go
its
really
cloudy
a
lot
like
a
wheat
but
mellow
and
at
the
same
time
very
flavorful
which
isnt
always
the
case
with
straight
wheats
and
its
not
as
hoppy
as
most
straight
ipas
as
such
i
liked
it
a
lot
more
apparently
im
now
a
fan
of
white
ipas
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
always
a
go
to
in
the
beer
aisle
and
even
better
on
draft
notes
im
not
sure
exactly
what
to
compare
this
to
as
it
is
the
first
belgian
ipa
ive
ever
had
interesting
style
with
many
possibilities
hazy
golden
w
minimal
head
lacing
beautiful
floral
papaya
nose
light
crisp
fizzy
mouthfeel
tastes
kind
of
like
a
shandy
but
with
a
bit
if
hops
bite
in
the
back
end
it
was
kind
of
like
a
more
bitter
raddler
or
a
slightly
assertive
shandy
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
something
different
for
me
its
a
belgian
wheat
beer
with
a
bigger
hop
profile
the
hop
profile
is
not
as
much
as
most
ipas
but
it
was
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
smells
like
spices
particularly
cinnamon
and
a
little
citrusy
too
tastes
approximately
like
pears
sprinkled
with
cinnamon
its
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
kinda
blends
in
with
all
the
other
servicable
white
ipas
out
there
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
under
a
hot
sun
perhaps
better
suited
for
a
summer
day
but
no
major
complaints
on
this
chilly
evening
o
as
it
is
its
good
tasty
flavors
and
excellent
drinkability
no
flaws
by
whats
in
it
only
flawed
by
what
isnt
im
by
no
means
a
hop
head
but
i
still
would
have
thought
an
ipa
would
have
more
hop
character
otherwise
call
it
a
hoppy
belgian
white
still
if
im
looking
to
put
down
a
6
pack
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
will
be
a
top
contender
it
is
very
drinkable
with
a
citrus
overtone
that
is
not
hoppy
but
offer
substantial
flavor
crisp
little
hybrid
beer
here
evocative
of
a
witbier
mainly
on
tap
into
a
growler
nose
has
spice
coriander
hops
taste
is
light
and
spicy
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
rjt
delicious
and
would
highly
recommend
this
pours
a
semihazy
color
with
some
floaties
and
an
frothy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
citrusy
for
an
ipa
the
taste
is
light
and
very
clean
with
lots
of
herbal
and
citrusy
note
this
is
an
intriguing
brew
from
deschutes
with
a
very
unique
taste
for
the
style
that
either
be
a
hot
or
miss
with
the
drinker
overall
this
gets
the
style
right
with
a
sweet
wheat
beer
coupled
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
from
being
too
sweet
overall
3
85
its
hard
to
pull
off
a
wheat
ipa
it
really
us
i
appreciate
the
effort
put
forth
but
it
just
falls
short
a
bit
for
the
style
if
this
were
labeled
a
wheat
ale
then
i
may
have
rated
this
slightly
higher
it
is
a
fairly
clean
tasting
wheat
beer
but
something
about
it
just
misses
the
mark
for
me
i
love
deschutes
inversion
ipa
but
this
tastes
too
much
like
a
wheat
ale
to
me
with
some
citrus
notes
it
pours
kind
of
cloudy
yellow
and
i
picked
up
the
citrus
on
the
nose
will
pass
in
the
future
o
this
is
more
of
a
wit
for
me
than
a
a
bipa
but
will
quench
a
thirst
on
a
hot
day
and
is
recccomeneded
herbal
and
light
avg
beer
very
fond
of
this
beer
i
preferred
it
to
most
of
the
other
deschutes
ipas
nice
and
cloudy
white
nice
citrus
and
bitterness
contrast
hoppy
hoppy
hoppy
very
pungent
aroma
that
doesnt
come
through
in
the
flavor
very
smooth
ipa
overall
really
nice
very
fruity
and
smooth
would
buy
again
and
exited
to
try
more
deschutes
brews
o
i
think
belgian
ipa
is
a
tough
style
to
master
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
example
but
it
falls
flat
of
perfect
in
a
few
areas
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
very
refreshing
wheat
beer
interesting
combo
of
smoothness
and
carbonated
crispness
nice
combination
of
flavors

not
bitter
enough
to
mask
the
floral
taste
in
my
opinion
creamy
smooth
this
is
an
enjoyable
unique
brew
witbier
meets
american
ipa
and
it
works
overall
3
55
a
solid
white
ipa
but
one
i
wouldnt
feel
the
need
to
have
again
i
was
drinking
this
last
night
while
i
was
rewatching
the
3rd
season
of
breaking
bad
and
i
thought
to
myself
why
does
my
mouth
taste
like
i
licked
the
asshole
of
a
soap
monster
upon
further
contemplation
i
realized
it
was
because
of
the
sad
excuse
for
a
white
ipa
by
deschutes
why
bring
such
scorn
and
sadness
dishonor
to
the
oregon
brewing
scene
have
you
no
love
for
your
home
and
native
land
come
back
when
you
get
a
in
mathematics
glass
tulip
absolutely
delicious
beer
must
have
the
mouthfeel
was
light
which
makes
it
a
perfect
summer
beer
it
had
a
smooth
quality
that
was
refreshing
and
quite
satisfying
perfect
amount
carbonation
just
enough
to
quench
your
thirst
very
drinkable
and
fresh
overall
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
belgian
witbier
saison
or
even
a
german
hefe
because
of
the
spice
and
coriander
that
is
quite
common
in
those
beer
styles
i
think
this
particular
beers
style
is
interesting
it
lives
up
to
its
name
for
sure
the
combination
of
an
ipa
and
a
witbier
definitely
hits
the
spot
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
couple
of
these
at
a
summer
bbq
solid
beer
give
it
a
try
othis
beer
leans
more
toward
the
white
side
of
a
white
ipa
at
times
i
think
im
drinking
a
wit
beer
actually
as
a
result
the
score
suffers
a
bit
since
i
would
expect
a
bit
more
hops
to
make
this
a
true
ipa
styleguideline
criticism
notwithstanding
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
much
better
than
the
ratings
indicated
very
refreshing
not
normally
a
bughe
fan
of
belgian
ipas
but
this
one
hits
the
spot
the
balance
of
lemon
and
grassiness
is
sensational
chalk
this
one
up
as
a
very
pleasant
surprise
well
every
rose
has
its
thorn
they
say
deschutes
is
no
different
and
heres
the
weak
weakest
link
ive
found
in
their
generally
incredible
beer
assortment
not
bad
by
any
mean
but
just
not
as
balanced
as
im
used
to
with
this
brewery
its
not
about
the
bitterness
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
neither
about
the
belgian
thing
i
love
belgian
triples
too
but
i
feel
like
drinking
two
beers
in
each
sip
here
theyre
both
good
but
theyre
just
not
part
of
the
same
beer
i
guess
this
is
still
a
very
decent
score
though
nice
enough
drop
could
use
bigger
hop
notes
im
guessing
this
is
quite
frankly
not
my
cup
of
tea
it
seems
to
be
well
received
but
not
by
my
palate
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
which
to
me
tastes
more
like
a
belgium
witte
than
an
ipa
d
shushem
down
bro
a
pretty
decent
summery
ale
with
some
nice
flavor
and
full
body
its
not
super
great
but
it
hits
the
spot
on
a
warm
day
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
o
deschutes
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
for
awhile
now
and
chainbreaker
white
ipa
is
another
solid
offering
that
keeps
them
towards
the
top
while
im
not
wowd
by
it
it
offers
enough
to
keep
me
satisfied
throughout
the
duration
of
the
glass
including
ipa
in
the
name
feels
like
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
me
considering
the
hops
hardly
play
a
role
being
dominated
by
the
belgian
white
spice
influence
hairsplitting
aside
chainbreaker
white
ipa
is
a
refreshing
spinoff
of
both
the
witbier
and
ipa
respectively
and
could
easily
find
its
way
into
my
cooler
during
a
summer
bbq
overall
this
is
another
nice
example
of
the
white
ipa
a
beer
like
this
could
be
considered
the
american
answer
to
the
belgian
ipa
of
course
the
style
varies
considerably
there
are
still
many
similarities
pretty
good
stuff
from
deschutes
brewery
here
refreshing
one
disclosure
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
taste
is
definitely
a
spicy
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
hybrid
with
a
touch
of
sour
grapefruit
rounding
off
the
edges
but
its
subtle
taking
backseat
to
the
wheat
and
yeast
character
i
get
some
lemon
zest
in
there
and
orange
even
too
really
this
is
a
complex
and
welldone
belgian
wit
and
one
id
love
to
try
again
o
a
well
executed
brew
this
thing
screams
summertime
hazy
very
lemony
aroma
belgian
yeast
pear
flavor
is
more
wheat
with
a
cracker
finish
lots
of
lemon
pear
and
grain
with
floral
highlights
slightly
spicy
clove
and
a
touch
of
proper
citrus
pith
very
clean
yeast
character
notes
of
bubblegum
esters
surface
late
beyond
its
milky
yellow
hues
the
firmly
headed
ale
sings
praises
of
both
witbier
and
american
ipa
however
the
hop
influences
only
provide
a
slight
tilt
to
the
lupulin
where
ipa
should
be
strongly
commanding
with
hop
bitterness
aroma
and
flavor
pale
shade
of
yellow
nearly
looks
like
that
lemon
haze
that
hoegaarden
has
bright
egg
shell
white
head
with
fine
even
banded
lacing
it
smells
great
citrus
notes
slightly
spiced
not
overkill
like
some
of
the
east
coast
versions
ive
had
this
is
balanced
wheat
accent
combine
nicely
with
the
hops
in
this
brew
the
flavor
has
spices
bread
coriander
citrus
peel
bitterness
a
bit
of
candied
lime
soft
corianderlavender
notes
very
herbal
middle
and
the
sharp
wheat
notes
make
it
all
work
together
so
well
on
the
palate
great
food
and
beer
pairing
would
be
some
mahi
mahi
fish
tacos
off
the
top
of
my
head
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
bodied
slightly
creamy
texture
from
the
wheat
base
and
has
a
nice
dry
spiced
finish
nothing
over
powers
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
well
balanced
white
ipa
i
believe
chainbreaker
is
a
trailblazer
overall
im
happy
with
this
beer
in
every
way
poured
from
bottle
to
glass
hazy
light
yellow
strong
foamy
white
head
carbonation
lowered
quickly
smelled
slightly
fruity
and
flowery
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
soft
taste
not
aggressively
anything
lemon
sage
tiny
amount
of
bitterness
medium
mouth
feel
tasted
more
of
a
whit
or
wheat
beer
then
ipa
it
was
a
good
beer
a
very
mild
ipa
pours
a
hazy
very
pale
straw
color
with
big
soapy
white
head
great
head
retention
all
the
way
through
drinking
the
glass
any
hops
in
the
aroma
are
overpowered
by
your
normal
witbier
aroma
wheat
and
lemony
herbal
yeast
taste
is
similar
but
the
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
medium
body
and
higher
carbonation
nice
refreshing
brew
light
hazy
color
wrocky
white
head
the
nose
is
lemony
and
herbal
and
some
things
in
the
mix
that
are
hard
to
place
but
create
a
nice
aroma
profile
very
smooth
solid
wheat
base
with
notes
of
citrus
though
not
a
lot
of
specifically
belgian
esters
good
beer
approachable
and
drinkable
creative
yet
not
mindblowing
great
beer
its
definitely
a
unique
taste
for
a
white
ipa
has
a
great
smell
great
body
and
is
very
smooth
going
down
easy
sipping
beer
for
a
warm
day
when
you
dont
want
the
full
body
of
an
ipa
great
starter
ipa
for
anyone
not
quite
ready
for
the
full
hippiness
of
ipas
d
a
very
nice
refreshing
brew
this
one
walks
a
fine
line
between
belgian
ipa
and
witbier
insanely
quaffable
im
not
sure
why
this
one
doesnt
have
higher
ratings
on
ba
because
i
find
it
quite
enjoyable
i
can
recommend
and
will
likely
find
this
in
my
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
going
forward
o
not
a
bad
beer
not
what
i
expect
when
i
read
ipa
though
more
yeasty
its
decent
though
overall
a
solid
brew
nice
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
as
an
ipa
ill
rate
it
accordingly
however
i
must
say
weve
got
a
good
effort
overall
an
alright
but
overall
completely
overpriced
brew
i
wouldnt
call
it
an
ipa
either
not
very
hoporientated
more
spicedriven
too
expensive
and
not
interesting
enough
drinkable
i
am
not
sure
i
ever
had
a
white
ipa
from
a
bottle
before
i
prefer
my
beer
to
come
from
a
tap
over
the
bottle
in
general
but
this
chainbreaker
white
was
a
nice
change
from
my
usual
selection
of
beers
while
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
favors
in
beer
i
liked
this
beer
maybe
i
was
just
thirsty
and
maybe
the
nice
finish
let
me
appreciate
the
slight
fruity
flavors
o
smells
great
taste
not
so
great
too
bitter
tied
to
the
phenolics
doesnt
pair
o
not
bad
but
id
rather
have
a
wit
followed
by
an
ipa
than
have
them
in
the
same
glasd
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
and
extremely
hazy
with
a
pure
white
cap
aromas
of
herbal
tea
lemons
lemon
rind
earth
wheat
coriander
hops
really
this
brew
drinks
as
advertised
a
hoppy
witbier
essentially
refreshing
and
crisp
finishing
dry
prickly
carbonation
with
a
tangy
mildly
tart
grapefruit
finish
lingering
bitterness
and
coriander
a
cool
and
unique
beer
overall
a
really
nice
wheat
beer
i
thought
the
ipa
in
the
name
is
a
little
misleading
this
is
more
of
an
attempt
to
cross
a
wheat
beer
with
an
ipa
so
the
hops
and
abv
are
not
what
you
probably
expect
when
you
see
ipa
but
deschutes
balanced
the
characteristics
nicely
here
o
a
nice
compromise
between
a
witbier
and
a
pale
ale
overall
clean
and
flavorful
a
good
beer
for
any
spring
day
for
all
the
talk
of
a
new
style
very
wity
cascade
and
citra
but
they
are
mostly
missing
or
lets
say
ive
had
hoppier
belgians
falls
between
two
stools
badly
overall
i
enjoy
deschutes
beers
frequently
and
this
one
doesnt
dissapoint
this
is
my
first
mediocre
review
on
here
but
if
the
label
says
ipa
i
want
at
least
some
of
the
bitter
notes
of
the
hops
to
come
through
this
one
tastes
more
like
a
basic
wheat
beer
with
a
generous
dose
of
lemon
squeezed
into
it
its
not
a
bad
drink
but
not
a
particularly
good
one
either
i
like
this
beer
a
local
wings
joint
has
this
on
draft
less
lemon
and
more
creamy
mouthful
on
tap
than
this
bottle
but
still
a
favorite
of
mine
a
very
good
beer
deschutes
is
quickly
becoming
a
favorite
brewery
of
mine
to
sample
i
will
buy
again
preferably
on
tap
carbonation
is
much
too
high
o
this
beer
is
delicious
i
love
the
white
ipa
style
akin
to
a
belgian
ipa
but
spicy
ohas
a
differant
color
than
i
am
use
to
in
an
ipa
but
was
enjoyable
a
great
beer
style
done
very
well
tasty
a
very
nice
beer
enjoyable
and
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
if
it
were
easily
available
as
it
is
it
doesnt
hit
the
special
beer
note
very
drinkable

i
was
skeptical
at
first
but
this
ipawitbier
combination
is
not
bad
this
raises
one
question
how
good
would
the
wit
be
on
its
own
too
odd
and
really
doesnt
work
to
this
palate
to
me
it
is
a
standard
hefwit
with
added
lemons
and
a
little
extra
hop
bite
i
was
excited
to
get
this
started
especially
after
really
agitating
it
in
the
bottle
per
the
labels
instructions
this
resulted
in
a
lot
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
that
slowly
fell
leaving
so
much
sticky
lacing
behind
that
i
may
be
forced
to
break
out
the
jackhammer
despite
planning
to
run
the
dishwasher
later
nose
was
really
spicy
like
coriander
black
pepper
and
even
perhaps
some
saison
yeast
i
want
this
in
my
mouth
yeah
yeah
thats
what
she
said
ad
nauseum
color
was
a
cloudy
lemonyellow
srm

and
when
combined
with
the
head
atop
it
it
looked
like
a
slice
of
lemon
meringue
pie
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
and
the
melange
of
hops
and
spices
was
riotous
i
was
reminded
of
a
recent
law
order
svu
episode
in
which
a
woman
was
performing
fellatio
with
a
mouthfeel
of
pop
rocks
this
beer
is
probably
what
that
must
be
like
although
i
have
no
personal
experience
this
was
an
exciting
beer
for
this
selfavowed
hophead
because
it
gave
an
allnew
dimension
to
the
style
the
finish
was
dry
but
not
gasping
as
some
aipas
have
been
when
saturated
with
hops
i
like
them
but
this
was
new
and
different
by
comparison
this
is
my
first
ever
white
ipa
i
am
very
happy
with
this
beer
not
your
average
belgian
on
tap
at
southpaw
in
sd
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
small
white
head
bretty
aroma
with
hay
spices
honey
light
pine
flavor
follows
as
a
combination
of
wit
tripel
and
ipa
light
spice
and
bretted
wit
flavor
some
yeasty
honey
and
clove
and
a
crisp
pine
hop
finish
light
bodied
high
carbonation
really
crisp
this
turned
out
nicely
for
a
style
that
to
me
is
mostly
meh
not
bad
o
a
great
pleasant
and
relaxed
beer
with
plenty
of
hearty
and
fresh
flavors
and
a
wonderful
dry
feel
it
doesnt
quite
reach
a
transcending
balance
but
it
has
great
qualities
nonetheless
d
nothing
particularly
special
to
write
home
about
however
the
flavors
come
together
in
good
harmony
a
nicely
refreshing
warm
weather
brew
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bright
whiteyellowish
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
of
grapefruit
some
hops
taste
is
grapefruit
some
tartness
hops
a
bit
of
malts
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
little
different
but
a
solid
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
overall
this
one
did
win
a
gabf
medal
and
deservedly
so
i
like
the
style
a
lot
and
this
one
is
a
great
example
of
a
hoppy
wit
good
stuff
deschutes
o
in
some
ways
its
well
done
in
others
its
somehow
plain
overall
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
a
ton
of
in
a
row
and
not
get
tired
of
and
not
pass
out
either
recommended
to
beer
geeks
and
to
beer
novices
as
well
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
i
wasnt
sure
if
the
combination
of
wheat
and
ipa
style
would
work
at
all
but
deschutes
has
done
this
nicely
however
for
me
it
seems
like
a
light
ipa
maybe
additional
malt
and
hops
would
make
this
good
beer
a
great
beer
at
first
impression
this
one
seems
to
be
more
wit
than
ipa
though
as
it
warms
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bitterness
there
is
a
little
clash
between
yeatspices
and
the
hops
but
it
does
not
seem
to
be
as
distracting
as
some
other
belgoipas
i
have
had
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
carbonation
is
finebubbled
sweetness
is
moderate
its
a
fairly
decent
beer
and
a
little
different
take
on
the
begian
ipa
style
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
buy
a
sixer
anytime
soon
o
nice
beer
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
belgian
ale
that
an
ipa
still
an
enjoyable
beer
without
being
overstated
o
overall
has
some
yeastiness
spicing
is
moderate
though
a
bit
muted
and
hardly
wow
worthy
the
hopping
is
adequate
but
a
bit
linear
carbonation
could
of
used
some
snap
body
is
light
enough
for
summer
use
end
result
is
somewhere
between
ok
and
good
c
this
isnt
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
but
its
a
good
one
it
keeps
the
qualities
of
both
an
ipa
and
belgian
wit
at
even
par
until
the
taste
and
even
then
its
still
good
but
being
such
an
ipa
fan
and
seeing
white
ipa
written
right
on
the
label
i
wanted
the
tropical
fruity
goodness
of
the
hops
to
be
the
star
of
the
show
and
to
that
it
fell
short
although
it
didnt
meet
my
expectations
it
still
made
for
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
sessioning
in
the
summer
months
its
very
good
beer
pours
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
ample
white
foam
aroma
is
spicy
yeast
citrus
zest
sourdough
and
lemon
meringue
pie
sweetness
palate
is
lemon
orange
coriander
clove
and
a
touch
of
yeasty
funkiness
that
approaches
brett
more
lemon
meringue
sweetness
followed
by
a
dry
and
bitter
finish
a
strong
yeastiness
persists
on
the
palate
along
with
an
acidity
like
weak
lemonade
and
a
hoppy
somewhat
herbal
bitterness
although
the
overall
effect
is
much
less
hoppy
than
the
ipa
designation
would
suggest
more
of
an
extra
sour
and
bitter
witbier
refreshing
and
sessionable
overall
a
refreshing
summer
brew
that
should
be
called
chainbreaker
white
ale
not
really
even
a
pale
ale
amount
of
hops
this
is
a
fantastic
summer
beer
it
pours
so
clear
and
so
orange
it
just
invites
you
to
come
hither
and
drink
from
it
supple
core
the
aroma
promises
a
citrus
zest
of
orange
lemon
and
every
tangy
memory
you
could
ever
imagine
the
taste
is
crisp
and
will
wake
you
up
if
you
start
slumbering
into
the
late
dogdays
of
heat
and
despair
the
finish
is
smooth
like
getting
out
of
the
pool
and
walking
into
the
last
30
seconds
of
an
automatic
car
wash
i
love
this
beer
and
will
forever
treasure
it
on
a
warm
summer
day
deschutes
must
have
released
this
to
entice
light
beer
drinkers
to
its
demographic
good
beer
overall
extremely
drinkable
nice
refreshing
citrus
flavors
overall
as
a
big
fan
of
belgian
witbiers
in
the
summertime
i
love
this
beer
it
has
all
of
the
flavors
i
love
in
a
belgian
wit
but
with
the
added
bonus
of
some
nice
subtle
citrus
hops
this
is
another
winner
from
deschutes
and
has
become
my
favorite
beer
of
this
summer
i
love
white
ipas
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
but
it
kind
of
let
me
down
there
alot
better
eaples
of
the
style
out
there
o
refreshing
and
different
drinkability
a
good
beer
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
both
strong
and
enjoyable
chainbreaker
poured
a
pale
and
hazy
yellow
straw
like
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
the
aroma
was
well
balanced
with
a
slightly
floral
aroma
and
lots
of
citrus
the
taste
was
light
with
lots
of
citrus
notes
some
hop
flavors
but
rather
balanced
some
sweet
belgian
candies
come
through
too
a
bit
lighter
but
not
exactly
watery
but
still
flavorful
overall
a
lighter
example
but
tasty
and
refreshing
overall
very
good
value
but
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
if
youre
seeking
hops
a
nice
beer
if
youre
after
a
refreshing

a

a

another
solid
offering
from
deschutes
overall
i
really
tried
to
find
something
i
really
liked
about
this
beer
unfortunately
it
didnt
happen
i
really
like
deschutes
as
a
brewery
but
this
one
fell
flat
both
literally
and
figuratively
the
call
it
a
white
ipa
but
drinks
more
like
a
wit
without
much
bite
i
would
recommend
the
porter
and
stout
instead
as
they
are
world
class
brews
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
its
light
enough
to
drink
in
hot
weather
and
has
enough
complexity
that
i
can
drink
it
pretty
slowly
this
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
very
biting
it
refreshes
first
then
coats
the
tongue
with
a
thin
bitter
layer
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
flavorful
brew
overall
with
a
decent
blend
of
graininess
and
a
lemony
taste
although
slightly
low
on
the
hop
profile
for
an
ipa
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
really
good
quite
refreshing
pours
a
very
nice

very

with

medium

with

overall
this
is

brew
and
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
normally
dont
go
for
bipas
but
this
one
was
very
well
executed
crisp
and
refreshing
poured
a
nice
cloudy
yellow
with
a
halffinger
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
ring
of
white
that
left
no
lacing
it
looks
a
lot
like
a
witbier
but
with
less
head
and
lacing
scents
of
pine
slight
citrus
coriander
and
belgian
yeast
smells
a
lot
like
a
west
coast
ipa
at
first
and
then
the
witbier
like
scents
emerge
flavors
of
pine
orange
peel
slight
coriander
spice
and
belgian
yeast
funk
like
a
witbier
and
ipa
crossed
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderated
carbonation
easy
to
drink
its
an
excellent
beer
a
combination
of
two
great
styles
that
work
together
in
a
unique
beer
eh
its
a
completely
average
for
a
wit
and
subpar
if
its
really
any
variation
of
an
ipa
o
delicious
brew
whose
flavour
is
well
received
on
the
palette
well
worth
a
try
easily
sessioned
and
would
be
incredible
on
a
patio
another
brew
i
wish
we
could
access
in
ontario
but
know
we
will
never
have
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
on
the
regular
overall
mixed
and
matched
for
2
50
this
was
a
great
white
ipa
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
again
easy
drinking
wheat
based
ipa
o
good
bipa
not
a
whole
lot
goin
on
but
overall
just
majorly
refreshing
served
on
tap
at
the
blue
heron
in
coos
bay
or
poured
a
quite
hazy
yellow
like
fresh
lemon
flesh
with
fairly
small
head
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
though
no
light
penetration
really
the
nose
had
lots
of
mute
colors
mostly
fruity
esters
of
the
yeast
and
some
white
bread
there
were
some
subtle
citrus
hops
especially
lemon
and
grapefruit
the
taste
had
a
little
more
bright
notes
to
it
the
fruity
yeast
was
big
on
the
palate
and
the
lemons
and
grapefruit
really
came
forward
more
than
on
the
nose
there
was
a
strong
clean
bittering
to
the
beer
pretty
dry
and
bitter
finish
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
incredible
it
may
be
lacking
on
the
ipa
front
a
bit
and
calling
it
an
ipa
may
lose
it
some
points
in
judging
but
seeing
that
this
is
a
fairly
new
style
i
think
you
have
to
be
a
little
open
minded
in
judging
it
it
gets
a
solid
4
out
of
5
from
me
so
its
lacking
a
little
in
the
hop
department
and
lacking
a
little
head
as
well
as
the
high
alcohol
content
coming
in
just
below
6
those
are
the
only
bad
points
if
you
can
call
them
that
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
this
is
a
pleasant
refreshing
beer
to
have
in
the
spring
or
summer
its
more
of
a
straight
up
belgian
wit
than
an
ipa
although
hops
are
definitely
present
pretty
good
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
whitbier
if
you
are
an
ipa
head
you
will
be
disappointed
o
maybe
its
just
a
fruity
ipa
with
a
bunch
of
wheat
thrown
in
but
it
really
works
o
fantastic
in
my
eyes
and
on
my
tongue
wont
blow
you
away
but
it
has
an
indelible
overall
quality
when
you
see
it
you
have
to
have
one
i
dont
know
o
a
fresh
drinkable
summer
session
beer
with
a
slightly
weak
and
underwhelming
flavour
overall
drinkability
this
beer
definitely
found
its
niche
a
nice
wheatipa
hybrid
might
be
a
bit
too
much
for
your
average
wheat
drinker
and
a
bit
too
light
for
ipa
lovers
chainbreaker
white
ipa
is
a
tasty
beer
from
deschutes
brewing
and
it
seems
like
it
would
be
right
at
home
served
next
to
the
pool
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
reasonably
complex
but
still
light
and
refreshing
and
its
the
type
of
beer
that
most
anyone
will
find
at
least
likeable
enough
to
drink
on
occasion
probably
not
my
style
and
i
appreciate
the
willingness
to
be
creative
but
i
could
not
get
through
this
beer
o
good
change
of
pace
for
a
summer
brew
wish
i
could
get
a
bit
more
of
the
hops
coming
through
as
they
are
dominated
by
a
fresh
healthy
wheat
o
deschutes
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
and
while
this
definitely
isnt
one
of
their
best
brews
its
not
really
bad
in
any
way
its
pretty
light
and
not
too
complex
but
not
bad
in
any
way
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
and
was
very
intrigued
when
i
first
saw
it
on
the
shelves
but
it
quickly
disappointed
for
how
great
most
of
deschutes
brews
are
this
beer
was
a
huge
let
down
for
me
m
really
nicely
carbonated
easily
drinkable
and
possibly
the
best
part
of
the
beer
this
tastes
more
like
a
witbier
dosed
up
with
some
hops
and
more
citrus
the
interesting
tartness
is
almost
in
the
range
of
some
sours
but
it
lacks
the
vinegar
edge
quite
lemonlime
flavored
with
an
enduring
sharpness
maybe
they
just
use
a
lot
of
orange
peel
and
the
hops
do
the
rest
the
hops
are
listed
as
bravo
citra
centennial
and
cascade
thoroughly
fascinating
brew
but
i
dont
need
more
than
one
for
the
forseeable
future
from

at

make

quencher
since
we
have
that

here
in
phx
ill
be
going
through
alot
of
this
im
sure
overall
a
tasty
and
wellmade
brew
for
those
whod
like
a
bit
of
a
hoppiness
to
their
hoegaarden
experience
i
admire
the
light
use
of
hops
so
that
the
belgian
yeast
likeness
remains
on
center
stage
i
wouldnt
think
twice
of
knocking
down
a
few
of
these
on
a
soft
spring
day
the
chainbeaker
needs
to
work
on

this
beer
pours
a
cloudy

with
thin

head

is

a
nice

the
scent
has
a
slight
piney

mixed
with
belgium
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
scent
with
the
addition
of
a
pepper
type
spice
that
gives
it
a
nice
flare
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium

with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
an
ok
belgium
style
white
ipa
d
very
enjoyable
beer
this
example
of
the
white
ipa
has
grown
on
me
this
looks
pretty
good
on
the
poura
light
hazy
yellow
with
very
active
bubbles
and
an
impressive
two
finger
head
which
leaves
strong
lacing
unfortunately
the
smell
is
very
grassy
and
grainy
and
the
taste
is
very
sweet
lemon
wheat
lemon
theres
some
lingering
bitterness
from

mostly
this
tastes
like

beer
without
the
coriander

im
mostly
just
getting
sweetness
along
with
a
zippy
carbonationits
an
okay
beer
but
probably
not
something
i
would
try
again
meh
overall
never
had
a
belgian
ipa
that
went
for
basically
a
belgian
white
base
with
a
northwest
pacific
hop
profile
really
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
this
tastes
like
an
average
witbier
thats
been
hopped
opening
with
a
refreshing
blend
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
lemon
mango
hop
flavors
theres
some
citrus

some

a
little
earthymuddled
and
some

the
wheat
backbone
here
is
disappointing
lacking
in
structure
it
is
limp
and
lacks
that
bready
crisp
and
slightly
dextrinous
definition
that
great
witbiers
have
instead
it
is
rather
loose
and
soft
a
little
watery
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
crisply
carbonated
a
little
too
much
imo
and
has

here
decent
a
very
bright
and
refreshing

make
for
a
crisp
drink
o
such
a
well
constructed
beer
has
big
element
of
both
belgian
and
ipa
styles
but
melded
into
what
the
style
should
be
stoked
that
this
is
available
is
6packs
here
this
will
be
become
a
session
regular
for
me
a
cheaper
and
more
available
version
of
the
collaboration
but
not
as
fulfilling
overall
an
enjoyable
belgian
ipa
i
like
the
fact
that
the
flavours
are
cohesive
and
dont
compete
with
one
another
definitely
would
suit
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
is
the
first
white
ipa
that
i
have
tried
to
me
it
was
a
great
success
it
is
like
the
more
common
summershandy
but
really
seems
like
a
beer
that
is
sweet
instead
of
a
lemonade
trying
to
be
a
beer
for
hardcore
ipa
lovers
this
may
not
be
as
robust
as
you
are
looking
for
but
for
someones
looking
for
a
lighter
side
of
the
ipa
spectrum
that
will
brighten
up
your
pallet
this
is
a
great
route
i
foresee
picking
up
more
of
this
in
the
summer
time
overalli
like
it
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
has
a
lighter
feel
than
a
traditional
ipa
easy
drinking
and
tastes
good
a
great
summer
weekend
beer
while
grilling
out
would
go
well
with
grilled
fish
with
a
bit
of

me

it

up
overall
this
is
a

variation
to
the
ipai
wasnt

if
i
would
really
enjoy
a
white

but
this
is

only
enhance

is
super
drinkable

this
is
the
perfect
summertime
brewi
could
drink
several
of
these
while
watching
a
day
game
at
wrigley
field
or
hanging
out
on
the
disc
golf
course
over
at
hudson
mills
and
be

brew
came
to
me
highly

overall
im
impressed
with
this
style
bending
offering
this
is
going
to
be
a
go
to
quaffer
come
summer
time
its
got
sunshine
and
yardwork
written
all
over
it
yummy
stuff
here
overall
loaded
with
hops
and
still
fruity
and
refreshing
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
and
as
luck
would
have
it
i
wont
have
to
thanks
to
the
second
bottle
from
greg
cheers
dude
fairly
refreshing
i
could
do
this
in
warm
weather
but
otherwise
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
more
like
a
witipa
hybrid
to
me
im
going
to
offer
this
one
to
my
wife
o
this
was
a
delightful
drinkable
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
interpretations
of
a
white
ipa
ive
had
but
there
are
just
some
things
id
like
to
see
different
to
make
this
one
a
home
run
for
me
all
those
bicycle
enthusiasts
in
the
city
must
be
pleased
with
another
bikereferencing
brew
on
the
shelves
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
lightlyhazy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
leek
and
light
lemongrass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
leek
is
thankfully
absent
replaced
by
a
good
dose
of
lemon
zest
light
coriander
and
grass
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
beer
but
one
that
seems
more
like
a
slightly
grassy
wit
than
an
actual
bipa
it
aint
bad
but
its
pretty
forgettable
overall
this
is
a
great
lawnmower
beer
that
you
can
chug
huge
volumes
down
the
hatch
this
is
less
of
an
ipa
and
more
of
a
belgian
wit
another
winner
from
deschuttes
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
good
thirst
quencher
poured
from
a
355ml
bottle
pours
a
cloudy

the
nose
offers
up

notes
its
very
fresh
and
bright
smelling
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
light
mouthfeel
and
has
all
the
requisite
tart
citrus
and
coriander
flavours
to
complement
the
spicyfruity
hop
notes
perfect
for
summer
but
really
enjoyable
yearround
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hop
presence
from
deschutes
especially
since
ipa
is
in
the
title
there
are
better
offerings
of
a
similar
profile
out
there
but
still
a
pretty
good
beer
nonetheless
o
this
beer
is
a
nice
bright
hoppy
beer
with
lots
of
depth
both
in
the
hops
and
in
the
yeastspice
characteristics
that
support
it
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
very
sessionable
dry
chalky
palate
with
a
good
body
dry
bananas
and
sweet
lightly
toasted
wheat
intermingle
with
citrusy
and
earthy
hop
flavors
this
beer
is
great
and
easy
and
fun
to
drink
o
the
zest
complimented
the
esters
from
the
yeast
easy
drinking
i
would
definitely
have
again
even
though
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
i
like
this
i
typically
hate
the
belgian
ipa
label
because
like
most
of
these
new
style
breweries
dont
know
what
the
style
is
i
am
not
going
to
claim
that
i
know
what
the
style
is
either
though
this
is
close
to
what
i
have
in
mind
regardless
just
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
o
great
beer
if
deschutes
offered
only
seasonals
id
wouldnt
feel
bad
about
losing
the
regular
lineup
nicely
balanced
very
refreshing
im
partial
to
citrus
forward
hops
and
the
belgium
yeast
only
enhances
the
the
lemony
taste
overall
not
the
best
beer
i
have
had
but
i
can
see
why
they
were
going
for
and
i
am
probably
not
who
they
wanted
to
impress
with
this
one
o
i
like
this
take
on
the
style
its
got
good
character
and
complexities
to
it
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
a
hop
kick
this
is
a
solid
brew
taste
is
beautiful
creamy
wheat
with
super
fresh
fruity
hops
complements
eachother
perfectly
what
an
amazing
beer
this
will
be
my
go
to
beer
for
sessioning
from
now
on
o
fairly
disappointed
with
this
one
not
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
not
that
its
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
its
just
not
a
great
belgian
ipa
there
are
better
examples
out
there
probably
wont
buy
this
one
again
above
average
to
average
score
if
this
were
a
witbeer
but
the
lack
of
obvious
hop
features
in
this
beer
were
a
serious
let
down
belgian
yeast
spices
and
lemony
wheat
take
center
stage
here
nicely
crafted
but
give
me
my
hops
please
overall
id
get
this
again
as
a
nice
palatecleaning
beer
not
really
for
a
session
other
than
the
misleading
name
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
good
contender
enjoyable
and
something
different
in
the
ipa
world
overall
3

a
nice
quaffable
summer
beer
belgian
ipa
is
a
pretty
broad
style
with
a
few
subcategorieshoppedup
tripelsstrong
ales
ipas
with
belgian
yeast
and
hoppy
witbiers
all
seem
to
qualify
this
one
is
definitely
in
the
latter
most
category
with
the
spicing
and
wheat
grain
providing
far
more
characteristic
to
the
beer
than
the
hops
i
drink
this
one
every
summer
but
i
do
wish
there
were
a
bit
more
presence
from
the
american
hops
maybe
it
would
be
more
noticeable
if
this
one
were
a
little
fresher
based
on
deschutes
120day
time
between
bottling
and
enjoy
by
this
bottle
was
packaged
on
626
making
it
over
4550
days
old
that
said
the
nice
thing
about
this
style
is
that
even
after
the
hops
have
faded
a
bit
it
remains
a
good
refreshing
beer
o
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
my
first
deschutes
to
be
im
a
sucker
for
bipas
but
i
guess
i
should
have
listened
to
the
ba
score
on
this
one
not
bad
ive
just
had
better
overall
this
beer
stars
off
as
a
spiced
witbier
yet
without
the
yeast
notes
as
it
warms
it
offers
a
garlicky
yeast
aroma
with
good
agitation
otherwise
the
lemon
and
spice
crowd
out
such
things
a
decent
beer
though
the
ipa
moniker
seems
a
bit
brazen
on
tap
at
churchkey
pours
a
hazy
strawyellow
with
a
good
white
head
and
some
nice
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
some
light
witbier
spice
alongside
nice
american
hops
beautiful
notes
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
come
through
alongside
a
nice
backbone
of
wheat
flavor
has
a
nice
body
with
good
wheat
presence
and
a
nice
cascade
and
citra
punch
extremely
drinkable
light
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
moderate
bitterness
excellent
o
i
like
the
beer
i
dont
like
the
beer
tastes
great
but
less
drinkable
my
first
white
ipa
chainbreaker
is
very
pale
golden
color
ale
with
some
haziness
a
tall
fluffy
head
sits
on
top
with
plenty
of
lacing
aroma
is
akin
to
a
beligum
wit
but
is
balanced
out
with
a
citrus
hop
bouquet
that
lightens
the
wit
beer
aroma
smells
wonderful
in
all
honesty
taste
is
like
wow
light
and
refreshing
hints
of
wheat
malts
yeasty
esters
and
lemon
grass
hops
drinks
smooth
and
tart
with
a
bitter
finish
probably
will
be
a
hit
in
the
summer
no
doubt
which
would
be
prefect
for
that
time
of
year
o
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
this
would
make
a
very
nice
cook
out
beer
in
the
summer
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
another
solid
offering
from
a
dependable
brewery
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
seem
to
fit
into
any
particular
styleit
is
more
like
a
witbier
ans
less
like
a
belgian
ipa
o
interesting
mix
of
styles
but
with
the
ipa
designation
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hop
presence
to
it
o
all
and
all
a
decent
brew
though
my
least
favorite
of
the
deschutes
family
i
can
see
it
being
a
good
session
a
very
nice
brew
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
pours
a
very
light
yellow
color
that
remonds
me
of
sunshine
the
head
is
frothy
and
white
sticking
to
the
glass
on
the
way
down
nice
floral
aroma
with
a
ton
of
belgian
wheat
and
yeast
and
lots
of
nice
citrus
notes
from
the
hops
very
nice
smell
nice
bitter
lemony
flavor
with
wheat
yeast
and
some
banana
grassy
hops
it
has
low
carbonation
with
a
refreshing
finish
this
beer
is
really
good
nice
representation
af
a
belgian
ipa
high
c
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
the
best
white
ipa
ive
had
the
man
version
of
blue
moon
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
solid
deschutes
brew
stacks
up
nicely
against
all
the
other
new
hoppy
wheats
out
there
billed
as
a
belgian
ipa
this
one
pours
a
very
light
pale
yellow
with
big
head
and
extensive
lacing
smells
clean
and
lemon
and
light
malt
not
picking
up
lots
of
ipa
hoppy
goodness
tastes
a
bit
bitter
mostly
on
the
citrus
side
and
wheat
and
yeast
but
not
detecting
much
of
the
claimed
spices
added
might
be
coriander
but
really
noticing
this
much
mouthfeel
is
fast
and
wet
and
fussy
and
refreshing
not
heavy
like
some
ipas
i
think
the
hops
could
be
more
aggressive
and
complex
to
match
the
ipa
label
but
this
is
a
good
beer
may
be
sessionable
pours
a
pale
pale
bright
hazy
straw
color
with
a
tall
white
frothy
head
that
holds
excellent
retention
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
wheat
freshly
squeezed
lemon
juice
citrus
wheat
yeast
and
grass
tastes
are
equally
as
fresh
with
lemon
grass
wheat
and
yeast
dominating
the
palate
in
unison
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
on
the
resiny
side
finishes
sharp
and
crisp
and
semidry
leaves
a
prickle
on
the
finish
with
some
white
pepper
nice
and
fresh
with
a
good
balance
of
flavors
this
white
ipa
has
a
decent
light
wheat
beer
taste
overall
a
very
solid
brew
definitely
worthy
to
try
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
wheat
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
aroma
is
lemony
citrus
and
notes
of
belgian
yeast
light
crisp
wet
mouthfeel
with
a
mild
carbonation
burn
at
the
finish
flavor
is
comprised
of
belgian
yeast
lemon
and
a
bit
like
a
pilsner
a
little
like
a
white
belgian
and
some
like
a
pale
ale
decent
interesting
beer
pours
a
hazy
dirty
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
too
long
a
nice
sweet
and
fruity
aroma
lemons
and
clementine
some
pepper
with
just
a
touch
of
some
tartness
to
it
interesting
flavor
follows
suit
quite
well
very
bright
while
also
being
sweet
lemon
and
clementine
on
top
of
a
wheat
underbelly
not
much
bitterness
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
pretty
good
beer
however
i
am
not
a
wheat
fan
and
after
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
i
find
that
wheat
malt
starts
to
begin
creeping
up
on
me
good
beer
objectivelly
not
quite
for
me
subjectivelly
o
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
as
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
and
the
whole
thing
comes
together
really
nicely
a
great
summer
beer
adding
to
my
list
of
favorites
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
by
10513
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
which
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
belgian
yeast
esters
banana
cloves
light
hops
with
crisp
light
malts
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
decent
a
little
belgian
funk
some
banana
light
hops
not
ipa
hops
and
some
crisp
malts
enjoyable
drink
pours
out
cloudy
yellow
the
head
is
white
and
has
minimal
retention
there
isnt
much
lacing
but
all
in
all
the
beer
looks
healthy
the
nose
is
peppery
and
floral
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
i
get
lemon
flowers
and
black
pepper
plus
a
good
amount
of
piney
hops
the
taste
is
bitter
and
spicy
im
still
getting
that
lemon
and
pepper
the
finish
is
bitter
and
lingering
the
mouth
feel
is
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
the
beer
goes
smooth
and
crisp
a
fantastic
beer
no
doubt
im
extremely
happy
this
beer
made
it
down
to
texas
ill
be
purchasing
this
quit
often
at
least
as
long
as
i
can
get
it
overall
i
am
just
not
feeling
this
one
very
different
but
sort
of
not
working
out
for
me
and
i
just
dont
feel
like
wanting
this
again
either
overall
a
solid
beer
rounding
out
another
good
offering
from
deschutes
brewery
not
quite
my
ticket
a
little
too
earthy
reminiscent
of
a
farmhouse
ale
or
saison
but
well
done
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
its
crisp
without
being
too
light
and
the
added
hops
at
least
im
assuming
they
added
more
hops
to
fit
the
ipa
style
give
it
a
nice
amount
of
bite
it
goes
very
well
with
pizza
another
fine
specimen
from
deschutes
m
light
to
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
o
overall
what
a
nice
surprise
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
bottle
says
ipa
ba
says
belgium
ipa
but
its
pretty
unique
and
doesnt
fall
neatly
into
either
of
those
categories
in
my
opinion
i
enjoy
the
unique
qualities
this
would
be
a
great
summer
time
cook
out
beer
its
light
refreshing
but
really
tasty
id
drink
this
again
no
doubt
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
hoppy
witbier
a
decent
6pack
to
bring
to
the
beach
or
to
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
oa
nice
white
ipa
the
bitterness
is
there
and
the
blend
of
orange
and
lemon
is
nice
final
thoughts
on
the
one
hand
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
ales
and
on
the
other
hand
im
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
chainbreaker
white
ipa
presents
a
rare
case
where
a
negative
and
a
positive
put
together
make
a
positive
not
bad
deschutes
my
wheat
beer
friend
liked
a
lot
but
this
was
after
3
hours
of
digging
a
trench
so
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt
ive
only
had
two
wheat
beers
that
surprised
me
pleasantly
this
is
average
and
i
dont
see
any
reason
for
it
to
have
the
ipa
moniker
oone
of
my
favorite
styles
i
have
been
waiting
for
this
one
to
show
up
it
doesnt
blow
my
socks
off
but
it
doesnt
blow
my
wallet
out
either
i
would
recommend
fans
of
this
style
go
after
this
one
smells
and
tastes
of
lemon
and
orange
peel
coriander
white
pepper
and
just
a
touch
of
clove
banana
with
a
heavy
aspirin
sort
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
its
kind
of
middle
of
the
road
for
my
tastes
ive
seen
this
idea
done
with
more
complexity
and
better
balance
than
this
before
o
a
perfect
six
pack
belgian
ipa
nothing
too
strong
but
it
drinks
very
well
worth
a
shot
o
white
ipas
are
one
of
my
new
favourite
up
and
coming
styles
and
it
seems
deschutes
has
pioneered
this
like
a
mini
conflux
no
2
real
good
flavours
great
price
i
like
it
not
the
beer
i
thought
i
was
buying
but
probably
would
be
excellent
if
i
was
sitting
in
the
sun
belgian
ipa
isnt
really
apt
theres
belgian
wit
spicing
but
theres
no
discernible
belgian
yeast
funk
this
is
just
a
northwest
wit
and
as
all
things
northwest
should
be
there
are
too
many
hops
love
this
pours
cloudy
but
bright
sunny
colored
if
that
makes
sense
lively
white
head
on
top
smells
like
fruityspicy
yeast
above
a
nice
hearty
hopped
up
pale
ale
im
picking
up
caramel
and
wheat
malts
both
in
the
flavor
with
piney
and
acidic
hops
working
up
a
feverish
finish
to
an
otherwise
quite
relaxed
brew
i
love
the
fruit
notes
together
with
the
bitter
hops
and
this
is
the
first
white
ipa
ive
had
that
i
really
really
dig
wildly
drinkable
because
of
its
plentiful
carbonation
and
body
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
great
6pack
to
drink
ill
be
getting
this
again
oi
think
i
would
enjoy
this
a
bit
more
if
it
was
less
ipa
and
more
belgian
white
but
then
again
i
absolutely
love
a
good
belgian
white
and
am
not
a
big
fan
of
ipas
it
has
a
really
nice
belgian
wit
backbone
however
this
is
such
an
interesting
brew
i
can
see
this
one
becoming
quite
popular
given
its
uniqueness
deschutes
is
so
great
at
making
the
dark
beers
this
one
in
its
own
way
is
such
a
well
made
beer
i
might
have
to
give
their
other
lighter
beers
a
closer
look
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
breweries
im
going
to
have
to
find
a
way
to
visit
bend
well
done
moreys
bottom
line
pretty
good
summer
beer
for
sure
the
best
by
date
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
is
sept
21st
so
this
one
only
has
a
few
weeks
left
but
im
not
getting
a
ton
of
hops
still
its
pretty
refreshing
and
not
offensive
in
any
way
cheers
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
everything
about
it
is
pleasant
its
the
first
white
i
p
a
ive
ever
tried
that
in
itself
is
unique
it
doesnt
have
the
usual
hoppy
taste
that
most
i
p
a
beers
have
instead
it
has
more
of
a
crisp
citrusy
taste
with
notes
of
citrus
in
the
nose
of
the
beer
perfect
amount
of
head
and
body
overall
its
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
like
most
beers
ive
had
out
of
the
deschutes
brewery
light
bodied
with
fizzy
carbonation
not
much
aftertaste
and
finishes
somewhat
dry
basically
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
belgian
ipa
decent
but
not
memorable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
bipa
a
tad
quirky
but
nothing
unusual
of
the
style
that
said
theres
also
nothing
that
really
sets
it
apart
in
my
experience
from
the
rest
of
the
beers
in
this
relatively
new
style
i
much
prefer
stones
calibelgique
though
if
price
were
a
concern
id
probably
choose
this
o
its
a
good
easy
drinking
example
of
the
style
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
has
room
for
improvement
i
think
this
is
my
first
belgian
ipa
where
a
wit
is
the
base
beer
instead
of
a
belgian
pale
or
dark
i
havent
been
too
impressed
with
belgian
ipas
and
this
one
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
either
the
hops
showing
up
as
more
of
a
tartness
is
interesting
worth
a
try
an
interesting
light
brew
soft
bitter
with
an
underlying
sweetness
a
good
warm
weather
thirst
quencher
poured
into
tripel
karmliet
glass
appearance
is
hazy
and
yellow
with
a
layer
of
dense
soapy
bubble
which
stick
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
belgian
esters
come
first
tons
of
yeast
banana
lemon
and
orange
peel
this
is
followed
by
a
faint
pine
hop
background
the
taste
features
more
hops
than
the
nose
and
brings
out
the
ipa
side
of
things
pine
and
resin
on
the
finish
carbonation
level
is
appropriate
and
body
is
light
there
seems
to
be
more
white
ale
than
ipa
here
still
not
entirely
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
style
nose
is
yeasty
bread
notes
lemon
and
slight
tangerine
the
taste
is
very
white
bread
flavors
lemon
yeast
and
there
is
some
cirus
hoppiness
in
there
that
actually
compliments
the
beer
very
well
think
something
similar
to
lost
coast
great
white
with
a
wedge
of
orange
in
it
a
white
ipa
is
actually
a
really
great
idea
as
long
as
the
hops
used
are
citrusy
overall
a
refreshing
summer
beer
nicely
balanced
between
the
two
underlying
styles
not
bad
at
all
this
one
is
a
surprisingly
light
crisp
affair
while
they
market
it
as
a
white
ipa
i
find
that
the
white
part
overshadows
the
ipa
its
very
much
like
a
witbier
ala
namaste
or
allagash
white
mild
pine
grain
i
do
like
this
and
will
probably
keep
grabbing
bottles
here
and
there
i
think
its
one
of
those
situations
where
something
isnt
a
world
beater
it
presents
qualities
both
appropriate
and
experimental
to
that
style
austere
hops
replace
traditional
seasonings

a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
leans
more
towards
being
a
wheat
beer
than
ipa
but
with
flaws
that
i
cant
quite
get
past
not
one
of
the
better
things
ive
had
from
deschutes
but
they
set
the
bar
so

this
is
still
pretty

a
very
underrated
beer
probably
the
best
belgian
style
imperial
ipa
ive
drunk
so
far
in
my
life
nose
is
unremarkable
and
slightly
malty
has
a
great
fairly
balanced
bitter
hop
taste
finish
is
nice
and
clean
a
pleasant
surprise
o
im
generally
not
big
on
belgian
style
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
i
might
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
it
but
i
wouldnt
complain
if
its
put
in
front
of
me
clear
copper
pour
with
offwhite
foam
aroma
of
yeast
malt
and
some
citrus
hop
bitter
up
front
with
a
mellow
lingering
bitter
but
pretty
clean
finish
not
the
best
of
this
style
but
entirely
enjoyable
best
beer
hands
down
awesome
name
too
bitter
but
not
terrible
these
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
drink
more
than
3
dont
let
your
girlfriend
drink
these
its
called
raging
bitch
for
a
reason
overall
well
balance
and
tasty
but
slightly
pedestrian
the
mouth
feel
is
the
weakest
link
but
this
beer
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
of
a
let
down
given
the
hype
fruity
lots
of
grape
fruit
o
strong
belgian
ipa
probably
best
described
as
a
dipa
very
enjoyable
will
get
again
i
love
this
beer
one
of
the
best
imperial
ipas
you
can
find
on
the
east
coast
let
alone

absolutely
delicious
and
definitely
worth

try

but
from

delicious
nonetheless
definitely
worth
a
try

i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
curious
ipa
flavor
unfortunately
i
am
not
much
given
to
beers
ipa
too
heavy
too
thick
too
belgiany
great
abv
and
just
a
great
heavy
ipa
very
citrusy
and
hard
to
put
down
once
you
get
going
i
made
the
mistake
of
downing
six
of
these
in
a
few
hours
and
felt
it
all
day
the
next
day
no
hang
over
though
sweet
and
bready
up
front
with
some
resiny
pine
notes
on
the
finish
lively
carbonation
not
that
bitter
i
drink
alot
of
this
beer
i
have
noticed
that
the
taste
varies
quite
a
bit
depending
on
the
batch
alcohol
level
is
high
so
go
easy
but
overall
one
of
my
top
10
favorites
overall
good
good
ipa
and
it
is
ok
big
thumbs
up
for
this
tasty
treat
enjoyed
the
unique
and
very
different
passionfruit
and
mango
flavors
punching
through
the
middle
nice
balanced
finish
too
a
yummy
gulper
this
one
and
very
good
value
at
the
checkout
definitely
worth
trying
pretty
much
an
average
ipa
enjoyable
but
nothing
spectacular
this
is
a
hoppy
beast
no
much
else
great
taste
for
this
style
of
beer
very
easy
drinking
being
a
hop
head
i
like
the
bitterness
the
flavors
are
a
bit
muddled
no
distinct
grapefruit
or
pine
the
alcohol
makes
up
for
this
different
batch
proved
this
to
be
a
much
better
beer
then
previously
experienced
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
it
started
so
promising
it
poured
a
beautiful
combination
of
light
copper
amber
and
dark
golden
a
modest
head
dissipates
into
a
thin
lace
that
retains
throughout
the
aroma
was
my
favorite
aspect
it
smelled
of
malts
sugar
and
tropical
fruits
i
was
excited
to
taste
this
one
however
the
aroma
and
taste
did
not
really
correspond
althought
there
is
a
slight
bready
fruity
and
malty
backbone
the
intense
hops
finish
is
overpowering
the
bitterness
does
not
seem
to
render
this
a
very
balanced
drink
the
feel
is
good
however
a
stinging
carbonation
medium
body
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
not
mind
having
again
but
overall
not
my
favorite
o
4
00
this
is
a
solid
ipa
it
doesnt
try
to
kill
you
with
bitterness
but
still
highlights
nice
hop
flavor
with
a
good
balance
of
malts
the
beer
looks
nice
in
the
glass
all
around
a
really
solid
ipa
will
drink
again
very
dry
finish
not
bad
but
needs
food
this
is
a
marketing
gimmick
nice
relatively
light
ipa
with
a
mild
aftertaste
love
it
this
certainly
tastes
and
smells
like
a
belgian
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
it
adds
a
nice
layer
of
bitter
on
top
of
what
would
be
a
nice
belgian
style
ale
i
would
get
this
again
first
time
trying
this
beer
i
think
its
really
good
very
mild
ipa
a
great
mix
of
beer
styles
great
head
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
very
well
made

at

hum
nyc
on
tap
listed
as
an
imperial
i
should
have
known
what
was
in
store
as
an
unhoppy
guy
this
should
have
been
an
aggressive
assault
on
the
ol
taste
buds
but
it
wasnt
assertive
sure
but
it
actually
had
enough
manners
to
almost
i
emphasize
the
almost
assuage
my
abject
aversion
to
the
happy
in
hoppy
philosophy
this
is
an
extremely
tasty
treat
but
i
must
admit
the
4
oz
taste
i
had
was
more
than
enough
god
bless
us
one
and
all
a
bitter
one
but
shes
so
good
i
may
get
my
pleasure
from
a
variety
of
beers
but
i
go
home
to
her
pours
a
coppergolden
color
bitter
and
hoppy
flavor
with
a
bit
of
tang
pleasant
aroma
alcohol
content
is
up
there
but
not
high
as
to
overpower
the
flavor
delicious
and
soothing
a
solid
beer
that
is
hoppy
and
slightly
grapefruity
over
all
over
good
tasty
ipa
one
of
the
coolest
labels
i
have
seen
lol
o
this
is
certainly
not
for
everyone
but
i
like
it
a
lot
its
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
one
of
the
few
ipas
on
the
market
that
is
bold
enough
in
my
opinion
to
hold
up
to
the
colder
months
here
in
new
england
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
but
is
has
grown
on
me
orange
and
cloudy
at
floral
hops
yeast
woody
earthiness
banana
and
clove
very
yeasty
and
astringent
not
great
the
taste
seems
harsh
with
netiher
style
really
coming
out
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
style
rather
have
just
a
ipa
or
belgian
ale
not
mixed
together
i
love
ipas
and
i
love
belgian
style
beers
when
you
combine
the
two
they
are
awesome
this
beer
fell
really
short
on
the
belgian
side
i
didnt
really
detect
any
of
the
clove
or
fruity
esters
you
get
from
a
belgian
beer
the
ipa
side
was
great
hop
aroma
and
flavor
were
on
the
citrus
side
with
a
nice
hop
bite
at
the
end
i
would
rate
this
beer
a
little
higher
if
the
belgian
side
came
out
a
little
stronger
one
of
a
kind
in
quality
and
taste
great
ipa
too
much
hops
on
the
finish
for
a
belgian
overall
very
tasty
full
of
hops
and
belgian
yeast
has
very
bitter
after
taste
it
took
me
about
half
the
beer
to
get
used
to
the
taste
very
flavorful
o
i
enjoyed
the
touch
of
west
coast
hops
tasted
more
like
a
strong
ipa
seemed
like
more
than
the
60
ibu
claimed
this
is
on
my
maybe
try
again
list
although
i
did
buy
a
6pak
nice
tangy
taste
different
than
rest
change
of
pace
8
3
kicker
and
smooth
a
hint
of
citrus
smell
but
this
one
packs
a
punch
with
the
bitterness
a
bit
too
strong
of
a
taste
for
it
to
be
an
everyday
beer
good
beer
whoa
momma
it
packs
a
punch
smells
good
but
this
btch
will
bite
you
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
and
shes
a
bitter
one
my
brother
in
law
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
and
brought
it
to
the
hospital
following
the
birth
of
my
daughter
two
months
later
there
are
a
couple
of
them
still
sitting
in
my
fridge
that
about
sums
up
my
feelings
towards
this
beer
one
of
the
best
ipas
i
have
had
interesting
flavor
and
a
lot
of
hops
an
enjoyable
and
wellmade
version
of
the
style
the
yeast
and
the
hops
not
colliding
but
rather
working
on
their
own
towards
the
common
good
a
pleasurable
whole
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
into
this
sort
of
thing
i
did
not
love
this
no
subtlety
to
the
flavor
and
you
can
really
taste
the
high
abv
i
do
however
love
flying
dogs
labeling
and
general
attitude
towards
the
world
so
ill
continue
buying
their
beer
just
not
the
raging
bitch
awesome
pullup
a
stool
and
sip
beer
goes
great
with
a
bar
meal
or
if
youd
like
a
taster
beer
to
get
yourself
buzzed
at
happy
hour

for
the
right
person
this
is
definitely
an
extremely
great
beer
unfortunately
my
palette
wasnt
able
to
enjoy
the
intense
hoppy
taste
the
beer
has
it
is
enjoyable
but
its
not
something
i
would
consistently
pick
up
the
name
is
great
though
has
a
violent
taste
strong
but
good
pours
really
nice
reddish
brown
with
a
1
5
inch
white
head
minimal
hop
smell
can
really
smell
the
malts
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
kick
of
hops
i
like
it
will
need
to
try
some
other
belgian
ipas
o
very
good
beer
especially
for
summer
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
glasses
and
shared
with
friends
its
a
nice
clear
amberorange
with
a
finger
or
so
of
white
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
of
dried
fruit
caramel
molasses
most
of
the
elements
you
expect
in
a
big
belgian
taste
displays
the
same
dried
fruit
character
but
with
some
herbal
spiciness
and
substantial
but
not
overwhelming
bitterness
nice
mouthfeel
overall
an
interesting
beer
this
was
my
first
belgian
ipa
and
i
did
enjoy
it
but
its
not
a
style
ill
seek
out
the
ralph
steadman
graphics
and
quote
on
the
bottle
were
nice
conversation
pieces
interesting
beer
really
nice
belgian

still
a
hearty
ipa
another
winner
from

stuff

not
my
style
ok
not
bad
color
and
appearance
great
head
ok
flavor
is
good
nice
hops
and
such
bottle
is
awesome
and
i
assume
that
is
what
draws
a
lot
of
people
to
this
beer
and
maybe
even
helps
boost
the
ratings
nice
flavor
but
a
touch
sweet
at
the
end
other
than
that
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
a
great
brewery
i
am
a
big
fan
of
ipas
and
bitter
belgian
style
beers
so
this
was
a
perfect
match
for
me
color
was
absolutely
extraordinary
however
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
head
retention
i
also
tend
to
like
a
more
dry
finish
while
this
was
a
little
sweet
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
the
color
clarity
and
finish
of
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
i
want
to
like
their
stuff
but
i
just
cant
oi
think
it
great
mixture
of
a
belgium
golden
ale
and
a
east
coast
ipa
nice
beer
so
hoppy
its
got
a
bunny
in
it
and
my
personal
favourite
its
got
an
orange
aftertaste
but
its
still
bleeding
hops
makes
for
good
conversation
a
deeper
amber
color
pours
very
little
head
but
nice
lacing
s
citrus
and
caramel
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
ale
t
sweet
with
good
malt
backbone
bitter
aftertaste
almost
tart
m
medium
with
hops
lingering
decent
carbonation
o
with
the
intriguing
yet
almost
repulsive
artwork
on
the
bottle
this
delivers
for
me
a
good
hop
to
malt
ratio
with
belgian
yeast
pleases
my
taste
buds
and
is
very
drinkable
to
my
standards
you
want
a
belgaipa
yada
yada
go
with
the
ruination
heaven
poured
into
pint
glass
a
really
great
take
on
an
often
poorly
executed
style
flying
dog
delights
us
again
with
the
raging
bitch
great
dark
golden
color
the
bitch
pours
easily
into
room
temperature
pint
glass
leaves
behind
medium
lacing
with
a
rich
goldenwhite
head
easy
belgian
taste
up
front
followed
quickly
by
bitter
hops
the
hop
takes
over
the
flavor
and
lingers
for
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
overall
very
nice
notes
of
the
belgian
fullness
are
there
but
in
my
opinion
the
hop
bites
quickly
and
doesnt
let
go
good
beer
would
drink
again
pours

crystal
clear

caramel
marshmallow
and
spice
those
all
carry
over
to
the
taste
and
combine
with
the
hops
and
flowers
to
give
a
distinct
molasses
note
the
bitterness
begins
to
come
through
as
it
warms
a
bit
nice
medium
mouth
that
coats
the
tongue
without
being
too
oily
this
isnt
something
i
would
drink
frequently
but
its
a
really
nice
change
of
pace
ipa
overall
a
very
good
beer
clarity
is
outstanding
quite
hoppy
also
the
high
abv
makes
it
very
relaxing
o
really
not
sure
what
to
think
im
not
a
fan
of
the
sweet
tripel
style
beers
and
i
am
a
fan
of
ipas
and
this
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
those
two
im
not
sure
that
it
works
for
my
taste
the
tripel
style
is
just
a
little
too
overpowering
almost
like
i
poured
a
tripel
into
a
glass
after
drinking
a
pale
ale
and
didnt
clean
the
glass
out
or
get
a
new
one
interesting
concept
and
really
not
a
bad
beer
i
could
see
this
working
for
some
but
its
not
for
me
pours
a
nice
copper
colour
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
definitely
reminds
me
of
a
good
belgian
ipa
but
it
isnt
particularly
interesting
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
hops
its
very
bitter
and
you
can
only
detect
a
little
balance
from
the
malts
quite
piney
and
im
quite
sure
i
can
taste
the
belgian
yeast
in
there
as
well
slighty
oily
mouthfeel
lots
of
carbonation
overall
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
go
down
as
a
favourite
this
beer
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
ive
drank
plenty
of
belgian
beers
and
plenty
of
ipas
many
high
alcohol
beers
but
this
beer
was
not
enjoyable
not
sure
where
to
put
my
finger
on
it
and
i
wont
stoop
as
low
as
gross
but
id
almost
rather
have
bud
light
overall
very
drinkable
clean
finishing
beer
would
be
paired
well
with
select
mexican
or
thai
dishes
o
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
one
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
just
wasnt
great
however
if
you
are
new
to
craft
and
want
to
try
an
ipa
for
the
first
time
without
having
your
palate
be
bombarded
check
this
one
out
raging
bitch
is
decent
ipa
just
not
astounding
would
be
good
for
the
curious
but
not
too
crazy
beer
lover
overall
this
is
my
first
belgian
style
ipa
and
its
pretty
much
what
i
imagined
more
on
the
american
ipa
spectrum
with
undertones
of
belgian
yeast
and
spices
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
but
quite
decent
really
bitterness
lingers
wouldnt
pick
this
over
what
im
used
to
in
an
american
ipa
but
something
ill
consider
again
if
i
want
to
switch
things
up
and
in
the
mood
for
a
more
earthy
ipa
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
attracted
by
the
art
by
ralph
steadman
he
drew
all
the
illustrations
for
hunter
s
thompson
and
was
excited
to
find
a
very
nice
beer
a
nice
hazy
yellow
amber
pour
with
a
lasting
head
the
smell
had
a
lot
of
citrus
hops
to
it
upon
the
taste
though
you
get
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
within
the
hops
compliment
the
belgian
yeast
perfectly
and
i
found
the
beer
to
be
very
refreshing
a
beer
with
great
flavors
cool
name
awesome
artwork
i
thought
it
was
great
m
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
on
the
aftertaste
but
its
not
detrimental
at
all
in
my
opinion
its
a
very
good
sessionable
beer
with
8
3
abv
it
has
a
good
taste
only
downside
is
the
alcohol
can
creep
up
on
you
taste
after
not
being
all
that
impressed
with
the
smell
i
didnt
expect
a
lot
from
the
taste
but
it
is
actually
pretty
good
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
floral
taste
with
a
slight
hint
of
sweetness
that
finishes
off
bitter
but
not
too
bitter
nice
reddish
amber
color
slightly
brown
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
citrusy
orange
grapfruit
nose
smells
like
an
ipa
kinda
tastes
like
an
ipa
but
there
is
something
else
in
there
perhaps
a
burnt
flavor
not
sure
doesnt
make
it
a
completely
different
beast
it
just
makes
it
a
litte
different
ever
so
slightly
chewy
and
a
bit
sticky
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
good
very
refreshing
though
i
am
thirsty
its
high
alcohol
content
can
make
it
dangerous
guess
ill
find
out
yum
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
belgian
style
beers
but
the
added
hops
to
consider
this
an
india
pale
ale
are
a
nice
touch
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
not
too
heavy
but
it
is
very
strong
and
did
not
go
well
with
dinner
the
flavor
profile
was
slightly
confusing
all
in
all
a
really
good
beer
i
am
glad
that
i
only
purchased
a
single
bottle
of
this
one
this
time
around
i
dont
know
maybe
this
bottle
was
from
a
bunch
that
wasnt
stored
properly
for
awhile
before
being
refrigerated
at
the
retailer
i
am
willing
to
come
back
to
this
one
again
after
some
time
to
give
it
another
shot
o
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
is
a
high
octane
brew
with
regards
to
aroma
flavor
and
alcohol
for
its
proclaimed
status
of
belgian
ipa
i
think
flying
dog
has
absolutely
nailed
the
style
i
am
happy
that
this
is
a
yearround
offering
and
will
be
back
for
more
4
75
i
recently
tasted
this
against
loose
cannon
id
expect
a
belgian
ipa
to
be
a
little
heavier
on
the
pale
malts
rather
than
the
dark
caramel
but
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
americanbelgian
hybrid
ive
had
it
a
few
times
before
but
this
is
by
far
the
freshest
bottled
less
than
two
weeks
ago
and
it
seems
to
make
a
huge
difference
as
it
warms
the
aroma
and
flavors
come
alive
and
really
make
an
impression
do
not
drink
this
beer
too
cold
you
will
be
doing
both
it
and
you
a
disservice
overall
as
long
as
i
can
find
it
fresh
i
think
ill
be
buying
a
lot
more
of
this
o
this
was
probably
the
first
belgian
ipa
id
ever
had
when
i
first
tried
it
years
ago
and
loved
it
still
holds
up
today
but
ive
certainly
met
other
beers
that
attempt
the
same
thing
and
do
it
better
since
then
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
high
abv
beer
not
really
heavy
and
you
can
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
because
it
not
so
heavy
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
high
abv
beer
and
you
like
ipas
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
out
i
would
recommend
this
beer
pours
amber
brown
with
some
head
and
sticky
lacing
aroma
provides
banana
some
farm
and
citrus
flavor
spicy
with
lemon
peel
good
sweet
malty
finish
pretty
thick
but
goes
down
swift
had
this
a
while
ago
and
didnt
enjoy
it
had
a
cough
syrup
note
this
is
improved
overall
a
very
nice
beer
smells
funny
but
tastes
great
was
a
little
apprehensive
to
try
it
but
very
glad
i
did
one
of
the
first
belgian
style
beers
i
have
tried
and
like
this
one
best
so
far
nice
smell
good
flavor
bottle
os
cool
haha
very
good
beer
and
looking
forward
to
trying
their
other
offerings
very
nice
and
among
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
had
definitely
more
pa
than
belgian
ipa
as
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
while
present
stand
in
the
background
after
experiencing
the
hoppiness
of
this
beer
the
hops
are
more
prominently
featured
than
the
belgian
yeast
making
this
one
of
the
hoppier
belgian
ipas
ive
had
but
definitely
a
pleasure
as
it
is
fullflavored
yet
restrained
and
balanced
well
enough
o
really
good
but
i
dont
think
it
even
begins
to
touch
the
potential
of
the
style
still
definitely
recommended
taste
some
sweetness
some
grapefruit
and
some
malt
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
the
fact
that
this
is
supposedly
their
best
beer
i
had
high
expectations
and
this
fell
short
of
those
expectations
it
really
was
just
your
ordinary
beer
you
would
get
off
tap
at
any
local
bar
i
will
have
forgotten
the
taste
of
this
beer
by
tomorrow
in
this
day
and
age
where
breweries
are
really
stepping
up
their
games
this
one
would
fall
in
the
bottom
40
of
beers
that
are
not
worth
your
money
paid
13
for
a
6pack
really
should
not
have
exceeded
10
picked
up
a
6
off
a
whim
while
i
wait
for
bedlam
to
return
around
here
full
time
it
is
not
going
to
take
bedlams
place
in
my
fridge
but
i
will
certainly
grab
this
from
time
to
time
had
this
at
the
blind
tiger
ale
house
in
nyc
it
was
cask
poured
by
gravity
so
it
just
kind
of
slowly
pours
out
of
the
cask
once
poured
looks
like
apple
cider
very
cloudy
hazy
no
foam
or
any
kind
of
head
citrus
and
grassy
aromas
upfront
the
interesting
thing
about
cask
conditioned
ales
and
i
really
have
had
only
a
few
in
my
life
is
the
almost
absence
of
carbonation
there
is
some
to
let
you
know
this
is
a
beer
amazingly
smooth
to
me
given
the
hop
kick
which
is
immediate
the
dryness
hits
you
hard
grapefruit
like
any
other
ipa
but
the
yeast
has
sugary
like
flavor
that
lets
you
know
this
is
belgian
style
overall
an
experience
really
unlike
regular
tap
beers
because
of
the
lack
of
carbonation
it
is
easy
to
drink
quickly
and
at
high
etoh
it
will
catch
up
to
you
quickly
a
must
try
for
any
beer
connoisseur
or
anyone
who
wants
to
try
something
different

almost

the

expresses
itself
only
as
that
nice

the

is
smooth
and
lingers
with
a

an
outstanding
offering
from

easily
the
best
year
round
flying
dog
brewery
product
not
that
some
of
the
others
arent
good
its
just
that
this
beer
is
superior
its
wonderful
it
doesnt
matter
if
its
room
temperature
or
frosty
cold
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
you
with
an
aftertaste
that
makes
you
crave
another
one
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
it
has
a
rich
taste
and
a
slightly
bitter
hop
after
thought
on
your
taste
buds
every
restaurant
should
have
it
because
it
pairs
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
every
pub
should
have
it
because
you
dont
find
beers
this
smooth
for
the
abv
concentration
that
it
is
comprised
of
a
odefinition
of
okay
beer
expected
more
great
label
art
quality
brewery
smells
and
tastes
were
too
muted
there
was
too
much
bitter
finish
without
a
balance
of
quality
sweet
malts
juicy
citrus
to
wash
said
bitters
out
citrus
tastes
rotten
like
old
grapefruit
but
with
a
robust
beer
drinker
palate
this
isnt
nauseating
raging
bitch
has
enough
belgian
and
ipa
nuances
to
be
branded
a
belgian
ipa
an
affordable
introduction
to
the
style
packed
with
a
high
8
30
abv
raging
bitch
is
by
no
means
a
regret
with
few
bipas
out
there
to
drink
its
worth
a
try
and
thats
about
it
o
while
id
be
lying
if
i
called
this
one
worldclass
id
also
being
doing
a
great
injustice
if
i
didnt
give
it
the
praise
it
deserves
this
is
a
fairly
common
brew
at
least
in
my
area
that
delivers
everything
i
look
for
good
nose
fullflavor
and
exceptional
flavor
while
id
be
wary
to
session
with
this
ill
definitely
be
revisiting
it
in
the
near
future
and
ill
definitely
be
recommending
this
to
others
with
caution
of
course
because
when
you
trifle
with
a
raging
bitch
youre
bound
to
get
bit
o
this
was
a
strange
yet
very
cool
experience
for
me
i
love
belgian
ales
and
ipas
and
this
was
the
first
time
ive
had
or
even
thought
of
the
flavors
being
combined
it
was
like
delirium
tremens
mixed
with
an
ipa
it
took
a
few
minutes
to
accept
what
was
going
on
but
the
more
it
happened
the
more
i
realized
how
beautifully
the
flavors
complemented
and
balanced
eachother
ill
be
having
this
one
from
time
to
time
raging
bitch
pours
a
cloudy
bronze
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
harsh
and
very
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
has
sweet
belgian
candy
flavors
but
then
finishes
with
a
harsh
earthy
and
hoppy
flavor
full
body
full
flavors
weird
flavors
overall
its
a
very
strange
beer
it
doesnt
really
know
what
it
is
or
trying
to
be
i
feel
like
its
someone
mixed
an
old
ipa
with
a
belgian
strong
o
flavored
like
a
massively
overhopped
heffe
hop
flavor
is
just
one
dimension
bitter
overall
this
is
my
first
belgianstyle
ipa
so
my
confidence
in
this
review
is
rather
low
id
like
to
try
more
of
this
style
although
i
currently
like
malty
beers
which
this
style
isnt
accordingly
i
did
like
the
way
this
beer
sweetened
as
it
warmed
note
i
am
not
a
professional
beer
taster
the
opinions
in
this
review
are
mine
and
mine
alone
verdict
ok
beer
not
enough
for
me
to
go
back
to
if
i
had
other
good

a

this

around
great

very
smooth

sip
on
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
ive
had
raging
bitch
on
tap
and
never
face
it
a
proper
review
thought
it
was
about
time
not
bad
to
have
when
you
crave
something
different
not
bad
to
have
at
all
salud
o
this
must
be
a
bad
batch
code

i
cant
believe
people
drink
this
and
give
it
decent
reviews
if
this
is
consistently
the
beers
flavor
flying

raging
bitch
belgianstyle
ipa
45
overall
quite
a
tasty
belgian
ipa
with
a
balance
of
traditional
belgian
and
american
characteristics
this
particular
take
has
a
lot
of
things
in
common
with
the
trippel
style
like
many
belgian
ipas
if
it
was
easier
for
me
to
get
my
hands
on
flying
dog
i
think
i
would
drink
this
quite
often
good
belgian
style
ipa
not
to
hoppy
but
with
a
good
flavor
high
alcohol
content
good
taste
first
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
flying

brewery
i
think
the
art
work
in
the
bottle
makes
the
beer
appear
most
special
than
it
actually
is
bought
this
beer
at
the
world
of
the
beers
in
west
henrietta
o
enjoyable
and
a
bit
different
but
probably
not
special
enough
for
me
to
want
to
buy
this
again
too
many
other
brews
out
there
of
similar
quality
at
an
even
better
price
or
better
quality
at
a
similar
price
but
i
suppose
if
you
live
in
midatlantica
where
this
dog
flies
lowest
you
might
pick
it
over
say
green
flash
wcipa
sn
torpedo
or
lagunitas
ipa
and
not
feel
particularly
shortchanged
raging
bitch
appears
to
be
angry
because
she
cant
stand
stably
on
shoes
that
hurt
like
new
the
foundation
is
out
of
balance
unable
to
merge
styles
without
unpleasant
clash
i
wonder
what
she
might
do
if
left
in
the
bottle
for
a
whileperhaps
lay
down
a
bit
and
let
some
classier
spice
emerge

with

that
fell

some

is
funky
with
belgian

tropical

with
a

and
floral
hop
notes
and
a
generous
deep
and
bready
malt
underneath
to
round
it
all
out
theres
a
touch
of
skunk
in
the
nose
thats
outrageous
and
frolicsome
as
it
warms
the
fruits
come
out
banana
and
bubblegum
up

taste
is
malt
dank
floral
and
fruity
the
sour
hops
and
bitter
climb
in
mid
palate
for
a
delightful
expression
its
plenty
fruity
with
citrus
banana
and
tangerine
but
the
malt
stays
up
strong
well
into
the
drink
and
the
dry
finish
some
medicinal
alcohol
on
the
palate
but
its
agreeable
warming
mouthfeel
is
buttery
smooth
totally
enjoyable
finishes
bitter
with
a
plucky
aftertaste
this
is
a
vivacious
belgian
ipa
that
lives
up
to
its
reputation
in
every
way
in
the
end
this
is
quite
good
recommended
for
double
ipa
lovers
looking
for
something
different
for
belgian
ipas
i
think
this
goes
a
bit
too
far
with
the
ipa
qualities
sort
of
the
flagship
beer
for
these
guys
this
one
is
everywhere
but
somehow
i
missed
it
until
now
thick
like
all
the
flying
dog
beers
are
this
one
is
well
hoppy
but
more
bitter
hops
meets
mildly
red
malt
and
its
not
a
totally
perfect
fusion
but
the
belgian
yeast
helps
them
be
more
cohesive
i
like
the
creamy
feel
and
the
bitterness
but
i
dont
care
for
the
sharp
acidic
almost
sweetness
or
the
way
this
stays
filling
in
my
stomach
long
after
just
a
single
beer
the
8
3
is
also
a
little
excessive
although
i
dont
think
its
too
forward
or
interfering
with
the
intended
flavors
its
in
balance
but
its
just
not
fantastic
probably
overhyped
to
some
extent
and
like
i
always
say
still
waiting
for
a
flying
dog
beer
that
really
wows
me
o
pretty
sweet
and
the
hops
in
it
bounces
flavors
around
a
lot
but
i
love
the
complexly
and
the
bite
at
the
end
i
see
where
she
gets
her
name
from
this
is
my
first
belgainstyle
ipa
so
i
dont
really
know
how
to
compare
it
to
others
and
i
think
i
could
only
drink
one
at
a
setting
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
because
of
the
mixed
reviews
and
im
not
generally
a
fan
of
ipas
belgian
or
otherwise
that
being
said
this
beer
probably
wont
appeal
to
the
hopheads
but
if
youre
trying
to
get
into
the
style
this
might
be
a
good
starting
point
overall
some
crossover
styles
are
terrific
some
are
simply
awful
this
is
sort
of
a
blend
of
two
good
beers
but
the
result
is
just
ok
the
aroma
is
terrific
but
the
hops
just
overpower
any
belgian
character
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
at
that
but
the
aroma
is
such
a
tease
in
that
regard
i
dont
think
id
rate
it
as
low
as
the
bros
or
as
high
as
the
readership
had
this
at
the
half
pint
in
the
west
village
nyc
raging
bitch
pours
a
nice
toasted
orange
color
with
a
full
foamy
white
head
great
aroma
of
tropical
fruits
fresh
cut
flowers
and
pine
i
found
that
this
beer
benefits
quite
a
bit
from
being
on
cask
as
it
added
earthy
complexity
with
the
hops
still
very
prevalent
tasting
more
resinous
than
they
typically
do
on
standard
tap
or
our
of
the
bottle
there
was
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
funk
as
well
that
was
not
at
all
unpleasant
although
the
mouth
feel
was
moderately
light
i
felt
that
this
was
very
warming
on
its
way
down
overall
a
great
ipa
to
try
on
cask
will
not
buy
again
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
grassy
a
hoppy
belgian
ale
with
lots
of
bite
mouthfeel
is
creamy
for
the
style
high
carbonation
medium
body
a
funky
yet
hoppy
belgian
ale
delicious
all
around
this
brew
was
way
too
sweet
for
my
taste
my
favorite
brew
is
a
dipa
so
i
guess
that
i
am
a
hop
head
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
with
the
intriguing
name
and
gave
away
5
of
the
bottles
i
guess
i
will
never
again
try
a
beer
that
has
belgian
style
on
the
bottle
overall
this
is
a
great
brewnot
for
beginners
amateurs
posers
bmc
only
dullards
toddlers
dabblers
or
anybody
unaffiliated
with
serious
beer
this
would
be
too
good
for
them
at
first
sip
the
remnants
of
the
head
offer
up
zesty
notes
of
citrus
several
sips
later
its
clear
that
this
beer
tends
to
use
its
10
alcohol
content
punchup
its
flavor
profile
instead
of
letting
the
ingredient
speak
for
themselves
thats
actually
not
a
bad
thing
but
it
does
leave
something
to
be
desired
after
the
experience
is
over
id
revisit
this
review
after
a
heavier
meal
prior
to
consuming
another
bottle
on
its
own
it
doesnt
do
much
to
leave
a
lasting
impression
not
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
out
there
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
goblet
gave
me
a
finger
and
a
half
worth
of
head
that
wa
a
slightly
dark
orange
color
smells
like
an
ipa
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
but
mostly
taste
like
an
ipa
mouthfell
is
medium
gfs
le
freak
or
some
of
the
others
are
much
better
examples
but
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
my
third
review
and
as
i
said
in
the
first
two
please
bare
with
me
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
the
glass
this
is
a
pretty
beer
a
dark
transparent
copper
the
average
pour
produced
about
an
inch
of
light
white
head
and
as
i
drank
the
lacing
clung
to
glass
the
entire
way
to
the
initial
pour
the
smell
really
made
me
want
to
dive
right
in
sweet
biscuit
some
banana
a
touch
of
piney
hops
the
taste
closely
mimicked
the
smell
yet
only
sweeter
that
delicious
biscuit
is
up
front
but
the
sweetness
surges
forward
next
i
tasted
a
rush
of
banana
and
some
unique
candy
which
is
best
described
as
bubblegum
but
is
much
more
indescribably
unique
the
hops
dont
appear
until
after
the
brew
leaves
the
pallet
with
the
hoppy
aftertaste
i
get
a
nice
boozey
rush
as
well
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
watery
maybe
even
oily
for
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
but
the
sweetness
deters
from
the
style
and
may
prohibit
prolonged
drinkability
o
real
nice
aroma
otherwise
a
relatively
average
belgium
ipa
not
something
id
probably
purchase
again
but
worth
a
try
interesting
brew
i
think
the
recipe
mustve
changed
over
the
years
dont
recall
so
much
tropical
fruit
character
bitterness
is
a
bit
too
much
for
my
palate
but
love
the
flavor
overall
ill
tolerate
the
bitterness
for
the
flavor
complexity
o
delicious
i
really
really
love
the
combo
of
belgian
yeast
with
citrusy
american
hops
phenomenal
combo
somewhat
similar
to
what
ive
done
with
some
of
my
homebrews
saison
yeast
wheat
citrusy
us
hops
overall
this
is
a
fairly
nice
yet
easily
drinkable
imperial
ipa
with
a
good
blend
of
hop
and
fruit
flavors
overall
i
love
this
beer
pretty
good
and
i
am
very
happy
with
it
looking
for
more
in
the
future
the
taste
drops
hints
that
it
is
a
belgian
style
ipa
with
the
pale
malts
banana
and
bubblegum
like
the
aroma
and
moderate
hop
bitterness
lingering
on
at
the
finish
but
there
is
something
rather
off
about
it
it
has
this
graininess
or
something
i
cannot
quite
define
it
looked
and
smelled
good
but
it
slipped
on
the
taste
m
after
just
taking
sips
of
the
beer
tho
it
kinda
shows
you
the
complete
opposite
of
its
taste
allowing
you
to
leave
it
in
your
mouth
so
smooth
and
subtle
until
your
ready
to
swallow
it
whole
in
which
you
encounter
its
full
wrath
and
flavor
a
strong
beer
with
the
high
alcohol
content
not
particularly
well
hidden
but
the
beer
is
definitely
belgian
in
style
and
taste
it
certainly
reminded
me
of
duvel
a
lot
but
it
wasnt
quite
in
the
same
league
as
it
pretty
tasty
overall
this
beer
is
a
great
taste
testing
beer
other
then
that
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
2
or
3
bottles
before
my
taste
buds
are
shoot
from
complexity
and
the
bitter
after
taste
overall
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
great
and
i
would
like
to
have
it
often
however
with
an
abv
of
over
8
i
would
need
to
keep
an
eye
on
my
consumption
which
brings
this
rating
down
slightly
i
have
to
add
i
wonder
afterwards
if
this
beer
is
bad
i
just
opened
a
smuttynose
ipa
which
ive
had
before
purchased
at
the
same
timeplacetoday
and
it
is
obviously
bad
not
the
great
ipa
i
remember
at
all
o
i
was
unsure
about
this
brew
at
first
i
drank
one
and
decided
i
would
write
the
review
a
couple
days
later
after
i
had
the
chance
to
drink
a
few
more
of
these
ive
just
about
polished
off
the
6er
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
will
miss
this
when
its
gone
i
dont
pick
up
much
if
any
of
the
belgian
character
i
was
expecting
seems
like
a
pretty
straight
forward
ipa
very
hoppy
piney
not
my
favorite
style
im
a
porter
stout
guy
but
i
enjoyed
the
change
up
from
the
routine
i
also
had
fun
explaining
to
my
7
year
old
why
daddys
beer
had
a
bad
word
on
the
bottle
lol
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
half
finger
of
off
white
head
trade
fades
smell
is
full
of
hops
and
a
bit
fruity
more
hops
in
the
taste
has
an
east
coast
like
hop
bitterness
there
is
also
a
nice
fruity
note
good
amount
of
sweetness
to
balance
the
hops
there
is
also
some
belgian
spice
hanging
around
but
you
have
to
pay
attention
to
not
miss
it
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
very
light
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
funky
metallic
aftertaste
that
is
on
the
dry
side
i
hope
this
was
just
a
bad
beer
as
i
dont
think
this
was
meant
to
be
as
bad
as
this
brew
was
tonight
ill
have
to
try
another
one
since
i
like
flying
dog
overall
overall
an
enjoyable
complex
brew
with
a
variety
of
different
elements
sweet
sour
bitter
and
rich
its
hard
to
put
a
label
on
it
ive
been
drinking
this
for
a
few
years
and
have
never
thought
about
it
as
hard
as
i
did
tonight
would
definitely
recommend
and
im
curious
to
see
where
this
style
goes
in
the
future
cheers
d
a
style
that
is
a
bit
tough
to
hit
at
least
in
my
opinion
flying
dog
does
a
pretty
good
job
here
i
gotta
say
this
is
definitely
one
of
their
more
enjoyable
brews
and
worth
picking
up
certainly
quite
interesting
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
couple
loose
ends
some
of
the
belgian
style
eventually
shines
through
behind
the
strong
hop
character
interesting
take
but
i
think
some
of
the
other
examples
of
this
style
are
more
balanced
and
more
interesting
definitely
pleasant
to
drink
though
overall
very
nice
ipa
which
i
will
definitely
look
for
again
price
is
good
at
10
a
sixer
a
potent
brew
with
a
high
abv
has
decent
flavor
and
aroma
o
i
thought
this
beer
had
promise
but
i
just
cant
get
over
the
funk
o
flying
dog
can
do
the
belgian
thing
well
thats
for
sure
this
and
wildeman
are
enough
to
prove
that
now
its
not
the
most
funky
estery
satisfyingly
belgian
beer
ive
tasted
recently
but
it
definitely
hits
the
spot
if
i
could
guarantee
its
freshness
id
certainly
buy
it
again
overall
solid
brew
more
ipa
than
belgian
but
some
interesting
yeast
flavors
d
aroma
is
underwhelming
but
it
sort
of
pulls
itself
together
in
the
end
just
needs
to
be
more
robust
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
body
with
an
offwhite
cap
that
rises
to
fill
the
glass
some
sip
marks
appear
but
they
are
light
the
nose
is
of
citrus
and
light
bready
malt
some
pine
and
yeasty
esters
poke
through
with
just
a
faint
hint
of
booze
the
flavor
profile
follows
the
nose
citrus
and
pine
with
some
floral
hops
poke
through
up
front
some
bready
malt
through
the
middle
with
spicy
esters
from
the
yeast
the
finish
is
a
touch
spicy
with
bitter
citrus
and
some
faint
warming
medium
body
a
bit
oily
smooth
this
beer
is
a
little
all
over
the
place
brash
in
spots
and
not
congruent
from
one
layer
to
another
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
not
as
tight
and
smooth
as
the
best
in
the
class
this
beer
smells
fruity
with
a
higher
than
average
alcohol
content
of
8
3
the
beer
is
a
dark
amber
color
when
poured
into
a
bottle
with
a
heavy
amount
of
white
lacing
flying
dog
forces
carbonation
in
their
beer
so
there
is
heavy
head
on
this
beer
it
leads
to
a
smooth
crisp
heavily
carbonated
though
not
in
a
bad
way
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
due
to
the
belgian
yeast
but
neither
that
nor
the
taste
of
the
hops
linger
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
poured
from
a
bottl
into
a
pint
glass
deep
orange
pour
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
decent
amount
of
belgian
yeast
alon
with
pine
and
grapefruit
it
taste
like
it
smells
very
heavy
on
belgian
yeast
and
grapefruit
lingering
bittersweet
finish
the
body
is
fullmedium
moderate
carbonation
easy
drinking
for
abv
not
usually
a
fan
of
this
brewery
but
this
one
seems
to
hit
the
mark
imo
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
o
weird
beer
never
had
one
like
it
before
overall
this
was
a
complex
unique
brew
that
you
have
to
taste
to
describe
belgian
spices
with
an
ipa
hoppiness
complex
and
tasty
try
if
you
like
either
styles
o
not
buying
this
again
overall
i
like
the
beer
i
am
a
sucker
for
ipas
so
i
like
the
well
brewed
and
classic
combination
of
flavors
and
scents
i
also
like
stronger
beers
so
this
one
is
right
down
my
alley
if
you
like
ipas
are
a
fan
of
flying
dog
brewery
or
want
to
try
a
solid
ipa
then
this
beer
would
work
well
i
am
sure
they
know
how
to
brew
a
beer
i
just
think
they
got
carried
away
with
this
one
mouthfeel
is
all
right
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
a
little
syrupy
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
i
think
every
time
ive
had
it
its
tasted
different
sometimes
more
of
the
tea
taste
sometimes
more
resinous
and
hoppy
i
guess
its
worth
trying
i
was
more
impressed
with
this
beer
than
i
thought
id
be
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
flying
dog
beers
very
easy
to
get
they
even
have
it
in
711
i
thought
this
a
good
if
unremarkable
belgianstyle
ipa
o
a
decent
beer
that
seems
to
need
a
little
help
on
the
flavor
profile
the
hops
that
build
up
ruin
the
belgium
aspect
of
this
one
which
destroys
the
complexity
i
want
more
belgium
flavor
however
it
is
really
easy
to
dink
for
a
8
5
beer
cheers
cheers
tried
it
on
two
more
occasions
after
other
various
beers
and
found
a
unusual
wheat
beer
taste
to
it
will
have
to
investigate
further
last
thoughts
my
mouth
still
has
that
lingering
bitter
alcohol
chalky
ipa
residue
on
it
thank
goodness
im
home
for
the
night
if
i
were
driving
somewhere
after
drinking
this
beer
a
cop
would
be
able
to
smell
this
on
my
breath
for
hours
after
drinking
it
i
am
ashamed
to
write
this
review
as
i
genuinely
liked
this
beer
on
my
first
sip
i
really
like
this
beer
i
think
its
very
smooth
yet
hoppy
not
that
this
is
significant
but
the
illustration
on
the
packaging
is
pretty
cool
im
drinking
it
right
now
in
fact
my
friends
and
i
have
been
enjoying
it
this
week
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
it
isnt
too
expensive
o
huge
props
to
fd
for
being
able
to
make
this
so
balanced
the
malts
hops
yeast
and
alcohol
blend
so
extremely
well
and
makes
this
a
great
example
of
the
style
obviously
it
leans
more
towards
american
versions
but
it
is
relatively
tame
or
at
least
it
seems
like
it
with
the
way
everything
goes
together
worth
picking
up
to
the
point
damn
this
is
one
nice
ale
i
will
be
keeping
this
raging
bitch
around
too
this
is
worthy
of
a
six
pack
purchase
if
you
dont
like
it
send
me
the
other
five
o
ipas
and
dipasiipas
are
my
favorite
brews
in
the
world
i
cant
say
the
same
for
wheat
beers
whether
they
be
belgian
style
or
weizens
or
whatnot
however
flying
dogs
ragin
bitch
hybrid
is
absolutely
phenomenal
it
kicks
your
ass
and
leaves
you
refreshed
all
at
once
this
would
be
the
ideal
beer
to
cool
down
with
on
a
hot
summer
day
magnifique
overall
a
wonderfulipa
with
belgian
yeast
o
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
style
ipa
a
little
heavy
on
the
fruit
flavors
and
lacking
on
hops
for
my
taste
recommended
more
for
the
belgian
ale
drinker
than
ipa
o
very
nice
belgian
ipa
abv
is
hidden
well
o
great
id
love
another
and
will
buy
6
glad
this
one
finally
made
it
into
mi
on
tap
pours
orange
with
a
short
lived
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
ripe
fruit
citrusy
hops
body
is
full
and
very
tangy
huge
amount
of
citrusy
hops
caramel
and
bready
malt
peaches
and
cherries
fill
the
mouth
finish
is
huge
and
very
hoppy
awesome
brew
o
the
yeast
that
shows
up
is
all
to
similar
to
many
saisons
ive
had
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
hop
character
in
the
aroma
and
plenty
to
go
around
in
the
taste
the
body
is
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
great
interpretation
the
first
time
i
drank
this
beer
i
believed
it
to
have
some
soapy
aromas
to
it
but
maybe
it
was
just
one
bad
bottle
really
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
belgian
ipa
but
its
a
good
beer
overall
hard
to
score
it
too
low
because
i
really
am
enjoying
it
but
hard
to
score
it
too
high
because
it
isnt
a
great
representation
of
the
style
id
buy
it
again
the
higher
abv
goes
virtually
unnoticed
looks
good
the
nose
is
typical
belgian
in
character
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
tangy
for
the
style
certainly
there
are
some
spicy
hop
tones
on
there
but
there
is
a
soapy
sweet
tone
that
is
a
bit
too
much
this
is
decent
but
its
not
quite
there
really
especially
with
so
many
others
of
this
style
available
nice
beer
but
not
quite
the
belgian
ipa
id
hope
for
overall
flavorful
but
not
really
memorable
pretty
drinkable
but
the
odor
turns
you
off
a
bit
just
not
quite
belgian
enough
for
me
nice
brew
i
certainly
picked
this
brew
up
because
of
the
namelabel
and
the
controversy
that
surrounded
that
but
it
holds
its
own
fairly
well
m
medium
bodied
spice
coats
the
mouth
o
i
will
buy
this
again
a
nice
ipa
for
a
hot
summer
evening
it
would
go
really
well
with
a
sharp
cheese
overall
this
beer
strikes
me
as
an
underwhelming
attempt
at
a
style
becoming
increasingly
popular
flying
dogs
focus
seemed
to
be
not
on
the
beer
as
a
cohesive
whole
but
rather
on
making
a
voluminously
hopped
ipa
with
some
fancy
yeast
in
it
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
herbal
hops
spices
belgian
yeast
and
slight
banana
taste
is
of
belgian
yeast
and
herbal
hops
up
front
with
a
malt
finish
and
a
slight
banana
aftertaste
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
in
the
flavor
department
with
a
great
smell
that
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
experience
o
this
beer
has
a
unique
taste
to
it
thats
hard
to
describe
i
really
like
it
it
looks
really
good
in
the
glass
too
decent
price
decent
beer
there
are
more
balanced
ipas
and
ones
with
more
hops
but
this
one
gets
the
hops
down
but
leaves
me
wanting
some
characterdepth
overall
a
unique
beer
give
it
a
go
o
a
nice
take
on
the
style
more
so
than
i
was
expecting
the
mouthfeel
is
really
what
makes
this
so
enjoyable
for
me
as
the
belgian
yeast
is
toned
down
and
carbonation
levels
are
just
right
easily
the
best
flying
dog
brew
i
have
had
yet
d
quite
good
with
an
interesting
taste
profile
that
leans
towards
a
malty
base
with
belgian
qualities
more
subdued
ogood
a
slight
departure
from
normal
ipas
which
is
good
sometimes
overall
their
wildeman
farmhouse
belgian
ipa
is
far
superior
the
belgian
yeast
qualities
in
this
are
just
too
scaled
back
giving
it
an
average
ipa
feel
with
just
a
touch
of
sour
as
if
someone
added
a
small
squirt
of
lemon
to
the
beer
of
the
45
belgian
ipas
ive
had
this
one
is
easily
the
least
interesting
o
this
beer
is
too
over
the
top
for
me
note
to
brewer
tone
it
down
so
the
flavor
has
a
chance
taste
is
spicy
with
definite
notes
of
citrus
hoppiness
nary
a
hint
of
the
relatively
high
abv
8
3
this
is
a
welldone
spicy
hoppy
belgianstyle
ipa
thats
worth
revisiting
o
i
was
impressed
by
everything
up
until
the
taste
the
sour
note
i
described
above
just
doesnt
fit
with
the
style
or
really
help
to
make
it
a
drinkable
beer
at
all
i
know
this
beer
gets
much
praise
in
the
community
but
im
not
seeing
it
here
i
plan
on
trying
it
again
soon
to
figure
out
if
i
found
a
bad
bottle
or
if
im
just
not
aclimated
to
the
taste
notes
one
of
my
personal
go
to
beers
whenever
i
cant
find
anything
else
appealing
insanely
drinkable
for
how
alcoholic
it
is
m
thicker
side
of
medium
body
but
has
enough
carbonation
to
mitigate
this
gets
a
chalky
sort
of
mineral
accent
during
the
extended
finish
that
goes
on
and
on
and
on
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
belgians
and
was
a
little
hesitant
to
pick
this
one
up
im
happy
with
it
tho
the
high
alcohol
balances
out
the
fruity
banana
taste
a
normnal
belgian
would
have
it
does
call
itself
an
ipa
and
i
can
taste
some
hops
but
not
overpowering
maybe
a
little
on
the
back
end
a
very
good
beer
o
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
am
a
huge
ipa
guy
and
belgians
are
my
second
favorite
style
my
only
knock
the
beer
is
more
of
a
70
ipa
and
30
belgian
the
belgian
style
takes
a
backseat
the
the
aggressive
hoppy
flavor
the
first
beer
has
a
better
balance
of
yeast
and
banana
flavor
but
with
all
the
hops
alcohol
and
malts
the
belgian
style
gets
lost
with
all
that
being
said
i
would
drink
this
a
any
day
and
any
time
if
you
like
aggressive
ipas
then
i
would
recommend
this
fo
sho
o
this
has
definitely
surpassed
my
expectations
and
turned
out
to
be
a
very
nice
belgianstyle
ipa
that
packs
a
huge
hop
bite
yet
has
enough
room
for
the
yeast
and
the
malts
to
shine
recommended
o
great
beer
love
the
belgian
yeast
and
the
sour
notes
european
hops
are
great
here
everything
about
this
bitchin
ipa
is
aggressive
buy
the
ticket
take
the
ride
you
look
at
the
bottle
and
think
what
kind
of
postapocalyptic
nightmare
have
i
found
myself
in
today
as
you
pour
you
inleash
the
fury
of
the
raging
hounds
of
hell
they
first
assault
your
senses
with
a
subtle
and
spicey
smell
luring
you
into
thinking
this
clear
perfectly
carbonated
drink
might
not
be
the
violent
ride
thought
it
was
when
you
take
your
first
sip
all
doubt
is
put
to
rest
you
are
being
attacked
by
an
animal
of
a
beverage
its
already
got
you
in
its
jaws
its
going
for
the
kill
violent
hops
stinging
spices
strong
yet
masked
alcohol
this
beer
is
a
killer
when
its
over
the
only
thing
you
are
left
wondering
is
what
the
hell
just
happened
and
whats
a
belgianstyle
ipa
doing
being
so
american
then
you
do
what
hunter
would
do
and
have
another
giving
this
a
solid
4
in
everything
i
have
not
had
another
belgian
style
ipa
to
compare
it
with
yet
but
this
is
a
good
beer
aftertaste
to
me
is
rather
spicy
not
in
a
bad
way
though
tons
of
flavors
each
sip
with
this
beer
that
you
tend
to
notice
till
the
last
bit
at
48
a
case
and
14
a
six
pack
i
dont
get
much
of
it
one
of
them
beers
you
want
to
drink
at
home
with
some
friends
it
will
get
you
nice
and
toasty
lol
i
had
been
hearing
good
things
about
this
flying
dog
effort
and
found
them
to
be
mostly
true
this
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
between
those
bold
american
hop
flavors
and
belgian
yeast
notes
that
kept
them
quite
complimentary
to
each
other
this
drank
nicely
for
the
bigger
size
here
as
well
ill
be
returning
to
this
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
dissipates
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
aroma
of
peaches
plums
pear
and
belgian
yeast
tastes
of
same
fruits
belgian
yeast
and
a
slight
bittnerness
that
follows
in
the
aftertaste
but
doesnt
stick
around
medium
bodied
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
robustness
of
the
hops
and
the
funk
through
both
the
nose
and
the
flavoring
the
aroma
sets
up
the
tasting
beautifully
with
all
the
bittering
belgian
activity
that
one
might
hope
for
while
leaving
plenty
of
room
for
balance
from
equally
as
bittering
hops
and
a
sweeter
malt
base
one
criticism
is
that
the
booze
particularly
at
the
end
of
the
flavoring
could
be
a
bit
overwhelming
at
times
taking
away
some
of
the
balance
previously
lauded
poured
into
a
snifter
this
beer
pours
brilliantly
clear
copper
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
diminished
to
a
skim
but
leaves
some
bits
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
tango
of
spicy
yeast
character
fruity
esters
and
citruslemony
hops
nice
the
initial
flavor
is
largely
spicy
phenols
immediately
replaced
by
moderate
citrus
hop
flavor
the
beer
finishes
with
a
dry
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
and
welcomes
the
reemergence
of
the
yeast
character
the
body
is
moderate
and
carbonation
mediumhigh
overall
a
good
looking
good
smelling
and
tasty
brew
definitely
worth
trying
though
some
tweaking
with
hop
flavorbitterness
and
carbonation
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
this
beer
could
be
elevated
further
o
this
one
kicks
ass
the
fellows
at
flying
dog
sure
know
what
they
are
doing
ive
had
so
many
belgian
ipas
from
belgium
this
one
is
better
than
most
of
the
ones
ive
tried
cheers
overall
a
really
good
ipa
thats
different
than
your
average
one
its
more
flowery
and
has
a
bit
more
sweetfruity
notes
to
it
very
nice
coming
from
a
brew
so
named
i
didnt
expect
such
a
balanced
beer
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
white
one
inch
head
dissipating
into
nice
lacing
lots
of
visible
carbonation
on
the
nose
i
notice
the
aroma
of
belgian
style
yeast
and
some
pine
also
some
sweet
malt
i
am
also
getting
some
citrus
orange
peel
this
beer
begins
bitter
then
you
get
the
familiar
belgian
beer
flavor
then
you
get
the
hops
again
i
am
picking
up
notes
of
pine
and
citrus
some
grapefruit
although
this
beer
has
a
relatively
high
alcohol
content
though
it
does
not
taste
hot
i
would
say
that
is
of
medium
body
though
the
alcohol
does
catch
up
to
you
i
am
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
it
is
everything
that
i
would
expect
from
the
style
had
this
one
at
bierkraft
earlier
today
on
a
whim
and
was
impressed
this
is
the
first
flying
dog
ive
had
because
i
tend
to
find
their
schtick
annoying
but
coming
out
of
the
cask
this
one
was
a
winner
it
has
a
nice
cloudy
gold
and
amber
hue
with
lots
of
fruity
hop
aromas
the
body
and
taste
work
well
together
as
the
malt
is
present
but
soft
which
works
well
with
the
lower
carbonation
of
the
cask
and
the
mild
diacetyl
o
i
love
this
beer
because
it
opened
me
up
to
a
whole
new
world
of
styles
flying
dog
is
a
decent
brewery
if
you
were
going
to
try
any
of
their
brews
this
should
be
the
one
o
this
beer
was
pretty
decent
however
there
are
many
other
ipas
that
i
would
rather
drink
the
taste
wasnt
bad
however
the
yeast
spice
and
hops
didnt
really
balance
the
best
in
my
opinion
the
yeast
was
a
little
bit
too
overpowering
for
an
ipa
and
didnt
match
the
best
with
the
bitterness
i
also
prefer
a
little
bit
more
sweetness
and
flavor
other
then
that
it
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
at
8
3
there
is
something
in
the
flavor
that
i
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
the
beer
is
good
absolutely
beautiful
and
enjoyable
all
around
o
this
is
a
belgian
ipa
that
favors
the
ipa
side
of
things
slightly
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
but
i
like
the
bitter
hoppy
kick
this
one
gives
the
high
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
flavors
are
great
a
pretty
good
beer
tastes
more
like
an
american
barleywine
than
a
bipa
cant
complain
about
it
qualitywise
but
might
not
be
what
you
are
expecting
coming
in
worth
trying
though
and
would
have
it
again
d
a
good
bitch
more
nice
than
raging
but
that
is
just
fine
robust
and
complex
tons
going
on
with
good
depth
no
clash
as
can
happen
in
this
style
all
the
aspects
work
well
together
very
interesting
yet
pleasant
and
scarily
drinkable
for
the
abv
luckily
the
richness
of
it
slow
down
a
bit
overall
a
bold
fruity
ipa
that
goes
down
so
smooth
that
it
offers
no
notice
of
the
higher
alcohol
content
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
coppery
orange
amber
nice
one
finger
white
head
and
lacing
aroma
of
belgian
spices
light
and
exotic
fruit
light
sweet
malt
interesting
combination
of
hops
malt
citrus
and
light
fruit
to
start
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
and
abrupt
which
doesnt
present
the
residual
citrus
and
piney
hops
that
well
nice
medium
almost
creamy
body
i
really
like
the
subdued
well
integrated
flavors
of
the
start
and
middle
which
make
up
for
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
think
is
a
great
example
of
its
style
o
this
is
a
belgian
ipa
that
favors
the
ipa
side
of
things
slightly
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
i
appreciate
both
the
belgian
flavors
and
the
bitter
hoppy
kick
this
one
gives
i
dont
like
too
many
of
flying
dogs
beers
but
this
one
is
very
good
the
high
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
flavors
are
great
o
an
absolutely
beautiful
beer
that
is
excellently
drinkable
the
body
is
thin
enough
to
go
down
easy
but
a
wonderful
dry
and
short
lived
hop
taste
keeps
you
tasting
all
the
way
down
overall
not
bad
nice
aroma
but
too
much
malt
even
for
a
belgian
ipa
a
very
belgian
brew
pleasant
a
really
solid
belgian
ipa
one
that
id
gladly
pick
up
again
temp
40
f
id
call
it
an
ipa
with
some
belgian
flavors
but
its
a
wilder
ipa
than
a
lot
of
the
pack
apparently
they
jiggled
a
bottle
enough
for
ralph
steadman
to
notice
and
pontificate
about
it
12
oz
bottle
from
best
damn
beer
store
in
san
diego
mouthfeel
this
is
the
only
area
for
improvement
i
would
have
liked
a
heavier
mouthfeel
that
went
down
a
bit
smoother
oh
well
its
a
small
critique
on
an
otherwise
wonderful
brew
oreceived
as
a
gift
and
would
definitely
buy
this
one
for
myself
a
surprise
to
me
because
when
i
hear
belgian
i
think
sweet
which
this
is
not
the
case
at
all
this
is
right
in
my
round
house
as
far
as
ipas
go
reddish
copper
with
a
voluminous
white
head
big
chuny
and
sticky
lace
lines
the
walls
of
the
glass
and
relatively
dense
head
retains
atop
the
beer
nose
is
floral
and
juicy
with
a
light
herbal
quality
just
as
expected
from
an
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
style
big
hop
notes
amidst
a
generous
amount
of
belgian
yeast
notes
light
bready
maltiniess
and
hints
of
spice
alcohol
is
detectable
malt
and
yeast
take
over
on
the
palate
light
sugariness
and
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
finish
hop
notes
are
muted
and
there
a
slight
candy
note
gentle
and
understated
bitterness
in
the
finish
some
resiny
notes
come
through
no
alcohol
on
the
palate
smooth
carbonation
an
actually
quite
favourable
easily
drinkable
but
not
too
complex
or
desirable
i
could
revisit
this
o
good
beer
great
name
want
to
see
more
of
this
style
across
the
board
have
been
impressed
with
this
brewery
will
never
forget
how
this
helped
break
the
ice
with
the
girlfriends
mom
by
recommending
it
to
her
while
out
to
dinner
copper
colour
with
1
5
fingers
of
white
head
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
left
behind
as
well
smell
is
spicy
and
yeasty
some
citrus
fruit
fairly
big
malt
presence
as
well
the
mix
of
hops
and
belgian
yeast
give
off
a
ginger
spiciness
as
well
lightly
floral
taste
starts
of
dry
and
yeasty
spicy
bitter
and
fairly
hoppy
some
alcohol
heat
some
sweetness
at
times
earthy
and
citrusy
aftertaste
high
carbonation
quite
dry
nice
weight
and
fairly
full
bodied
though
at
first
i
really
couldnt
decide
if
i
liked
this
or
not
but
this
is
pretty
good
definitely
something
i
would
revisit
doverall
this
was
a
nice
ipa
i
think
id
like
to
try
more
from
this
style
this
was
not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
means
but
i
thought
the
yeasty
and
hoppy
flavors
had
a
nice
balance
give
this
beer
a
try
o
this
is
a
great
beer
now
one
of
my
favorites
well
balanced
and
moderately
priced
overall
this
is
some
really
delicious
nectar
i
wish
i
had
gotten
more
i
bought
it
because
im
curious
about
bipas
this
one
is
definitely
more
on
the
ipa
side
than
the
belgian
side
mostly
an
ipa
but
with
some
belgianbananasmelling
softness
within
the
style
this
is
sort
of
opposite
the
white
birch
hooksett
ale
from
nh
that
one
is
more
belgianey
less
hoppy
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
is
fun
to
drink
overall
i
am
trying
to
get
into
bipas
but
something
keeps
me
from
really
enjoying
them
as
much
as
i
should
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
isnt
the
most
gulpable
but
is
still
more
than
sippable
the
body
is
a
pretty
standard
density
for
the
style
but
is
a
bit
on
the
sticky
side
the
carbonation
is
certainly
doing
a
lot
in
the
background
but
is
not
really
noticeable
as
such
more
carbonation
could
definitely
help
to
increase
this
beers
drinkability
and
cut
the
stickiness
of
the
body
overall
a
very
nice
hoppy
ipa
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
pale
ales
but
this
one
brings
an
american
ipa
twist
that
makes
it
nice
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
and
will
definitely
have
some
more
in
the
future
like
the
smell
definite
grassy
hops
up
front
good
bitterness
somewhat
mild
sweetness
detect
some
light
sugary
candy
but
the
taste
consists
mostly
of
the
hops
with
a
definite
alcohol
presence
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
definitely
for
sipping
ipas
with
citrus
like
hops
are
what
i
tend
to
lean
towards
and
this
one
is
a
fine
example
cant
beat
the
price
either
i
paid
7
48
for
a
sixpack
oa
nice
ipa
of
this
style
and
good
overall
balance
overall
is
good
overall
seems
little
harsh
at
times
but
keep
going
back
for
more
sips
buying
this
overseas
i
was
worried
that
it
would
have
suffered
from
the
journey
but
i
found
it
crisp
and
hoppy
as
ever
with
some
really
interesting
highlights
better
than
the
other
belgian
ipas
ive
had
stone
north
peak
lagunitas
great
divide
i
would
buy
it
again
o
kind
of
reminds
me
of
stone
ruination
ipa
in
a
way
but
its
cheaper
more
satisfying
to
drink
and
just
as
ruinous
and
more
phenolic
cant
forget
that
a
definite
winner
in
my
book
though
be
warned
this
could
pass
for
a
dipa
in
terms
of
bitterness
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
and
i
think
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
wonky
but
its
a
solid
belgian
ipa
that
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
a
few
of
4
0
o
an
amazing
bipa
and
a
great
beer
i
have
no
qualms
with
this
whatsoever
except
maybe
the
head
and
head
retention
o
this
is
on
the
west
coast
side
of
a
belgianamerican
ipa
a
most
pleasant
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
very
refreshing
overall
a
very
well
done
balanced
beer
plus
it
comes
with
a
pretty
sweet
label
recommended
by
a
gentleman
in
watertown
wow
cool
beer
i
read
the
bros
review
but
i
must
disagree
an
excellent
beer
wonderfully
rich
hop
aroma
dry
hopped
for
sure
piney
taste
is
interesting
indeed
huge
hops
with
a
spicy
bite
peppery
perhaps
from
a
belgian
yeast
so
smooth
with
a
rich
mouthfeel
gentle
but
lingering
bitterness
high
marks
bros
try
this
again
o
great
beer
fresh
or
with
a
little
age
if
you
get
it
fresh
its
pretty
bitter
and
the
hops
shine
wait
a
little
and
the
hops
mellow
out
and
the
belgian
yeast
shines
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
ipa
whoa
a
most
excellent
beer
served
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
large
foamy
frothy
off
white
head
that
settles
to
a
light
cover
after
a
bit
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
medium
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
flavor
is
huge
hop
with
plenty
of
malt
dry
spice
carbonic
tang
a
little
banana
body
is
perfect
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
very
long
and
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
good
hop
head
brew
appearance
light
to
medium
amber
smell
is
refreshing
and
hoppy
with
hints
of
malt
mouthfeel
is
well
let
me
see
if
we
can
discribe
this
it
hits
the
tongue
with
sweetness
and
then
move
around
to
the
back
with
slight
bitterness
then
it
is
gone
nice
taste
is
great
overall
this
beer
is
very
fridge
worth
and
will
complement
ribs
very
well
overall
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
a
wonderful
complexity
of
flavors
here
not
exactly
balanced
here
as
there
is
a
definite
order
and
progression
but
i
love
the
progression
in
this
belgian
ipa
none
of
the
acts
in
this
play
stands
out
they
work
perfectly
together
i
love
this
beer
very
nice
light
yellow
amber
clear
with
good
lace
and
head
pleasant
hoppy
scent
with
flowers
in
the
background
flavors
are
a
battle
between
hoppy
ale
and
yeasty
floral
ale
that
never
reconciles
itself
with
balance
part
of
the
reason
is
the
differing
types
of
water
that
go
with
these
two
experiences
overall
an
o
k
brew
o
dangerously
drinkable
at
8
5
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
flavours
are
perfectly
matched
for
the
style
another
winner
from
flying
dog
o
im
not
a
huge
ipa
fan
but
this
one
blew
me
away
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
its
thirstquenching
and
tasty
if
it
werent
for
the
high
abv
this
would
a
great
session
beer
as
it
certainly
has
the
flavor
for
it
unique
brew
if
nothing
else
hv
o
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
bottle
of
beer
but
i
know
that
i
tend
to
like
my
beers
on
the
hoppy
side
do
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavors
are
all
spoton
but
the
most
detracting
aspect
of
this
beer
is
the
bitterness
it
brings
that
seems
to
overshadow
them
at
times
this
is
a
pretty
decent
easilyavailable
belgian
ipa
but
id
probably
have
to
give
the
edge
to
great
divides
belgica
in
terms
of
one
i
can
grab
off
the
shelf
while
its
actually
an
ok
ipa
its
not
really
belgian
in
any
way
aside
from
the
slight
belgian
yeast
smell
there
is
little
else
to
be
considered
belgian
here
so
if
this
was
just
an
ipa
id
give
this
a
bit
better
score
but
its
not
glad
to
grab
a
6
pack
while
they
are
still
available
head
is
short
lived
into
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
edge
copper
color
is
a
bit
darker
than
one
would
expect
given
the
taste
aroma
is
complex
but
dominated
by
hops
that
are
present
throughout
smell
and
taste
pronounced
bitterness
with
dry
finish
best
of
both
worlds
for
those
who
like
belgians
and
hops
moreys
bottom
line
while
im
not
a
fan
of
the
artwork
or
the
name
of
this
beer
i
have
to
say
its
whats
in
the
bottle
that
really
counts
and
whats
in
this
bottle
is
a
really
good
beer
cheers
o
this
brew
kicked
some
serious
butt
love
the
style
great
balance
and
superior
flavor
ogreat
belgian
ipa
one
of
the
hoppier
versions
i
have
had
manages
to
include
both
the
gentle
bananacitrus
taste
up
front
with
an
alcohol
kick
at
the
end
but
the
flavors
are
distinct
and
they
go
well
together
my
favorite
offering
from
flying
dog
had
in
a
12oz
bottle
on
8511
have
had
it
before
but
never
reviewed
o
most
definitely
an
interesting
beer
tasty
and
uniqie
worth
seeking
out
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
is
one
of
the
best
dipas
to
date
the
lower
alcohol
helps
and
i
found
the
spices
kept
me
coming
back
in
most
beers
they
keep
me
away
ill
probably
pick
up
a
4pk
next
time
i
see
this
i
suspect
some
this
dipa
would
be
good
fresh
or
old
and
anywhere
between
so
id
like
to
experiment
an
imposter
of
style
but
still
quite
a
lusty
offering
which
i
just
cant
ignore
could
happily
drink
another
six
maybe
seven
in
succession
o
as
a
belgian
ipa
this
misses
the
mark
as
just
a
dipa
it
is
pretty
good
but
not
among
the
top
tier
recommended
music
pairing
vince
guaraldi
black
orpheus
o
a
great
belgian
ipa
more
of
a
dipa
with
some
belgian
influence
this
is
a
great
unique
brew
worth
trying
very
complex
taste
but
not
confusing
overall
this
beer
really
blends
the
two
styles
of
tripel
and
ipa
together
beautifully
after
getting
an
idea
in
my
head
of
what
the
style
should
be
this
has
definitely
come
the
closest
to
that
idea
pretty
damn
close
in
fact
the
only
quip
about
it
that
i
have
is
that
while
i
think
it
is
pretty
much
stylistic
perfection
because
it
fits
my
definition
almost
exactly
it
just
doesnt
have
that
intangible
bliss
factor
that
comes
with
a
perfect
beer
it
is
because
it
so
closely
fits
the
definition
that
it
isnt
perfect
theres
just
no
feeling
of
bending
the
rules
to
make
something
unique
but
still
stylistically
accurate
i
will
most
definitely
be
buying
this
beer
again
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
ability
to
make
me
break
from
thinking
analytically
about
the
beer
like
an
a
beer
should
im
still
giving
it
a
4
5
overall
because
it
is
so
well
crafted
really
and
truly
just
a
technically
astounding
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
one
i
would
definitely
have
again
i
would
really
like
to
try
it
a
ontap
and
b
in
a
different
glass
however
were
i
in
the
mood
to
go
out
and
buy
another
belgian
ipa
on
which
i
intend
i
would
probably
try
out
something
else
poured
into
13
oz
tulip
pours
a
hazy
orangered
with
a
sticky
one
inch
white
head
smell
is
clove
pine
citrus
and
a
little
banana
taste
that
but
more
pine
and
citrus
than
the
others
more
ipa
than
belgian
that
is
why
i
love
this
beer
very
drinkleable
for
its
abv
great
body
with
plenty
of
life
wish
didnt
have
to
leave
state
to
get
it
overall
i
love
this
beer
it
is
interesting
complex
and
drinkable
i
feel
like
the
ipa
characteristics
and
the
big
belgian
characteristics
are
in
conflict
more
than
they
are
in
harmony
though
definitely
well
made
and
worth
a
try
though
o
i
didnt
really
get
much
of
a
belgian
taste
in
this
beer
the
only
other
belgian
ipa
i
have
had
was
by
terapin
and
that
definitely
had
that
belgian
taste
to
it
theres
better
cheaper
ipas
out
there
that
i
would
buy
before
i
buy
this
again
it
just
didnt
have
what
it
advertised
the
finish
is
hoppy
upfront
and
all
about
the
spicy
character
of
belgian
yeast
on
the
back
end
great
bready
aftertaste
lingers
o
a
good
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
could
easily
see
someone
enjoying
this
a
lot
o
if
high
alcohol
content
and
crazy
hop
bite
is
your
thing
then
go
for
it
but
if
youre
thinking
youll
be
getting
a
unique
complex
mix
of
the
subtle
flavors
of
a
belgian
and
the
balls
out
flavor
of
an
ipa
youll
be
a
bit
disappointed
o
cool
bottle
interesting
name
great
beer
very
interesting
beer
havent
tried
anything
like
this
and
it
sooo
good
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
very
hard
to
give
this
a
rating
if
i
could
i
would
give
it
a
4
25
for
taste
and
total
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
maybe
freshness
played
a
role
pours
orange
honey
color
with
nice
frothy
off
white
head
which
sticks
around
with
nice
lacing
bubbles
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
spices
with
hops
noticeable
spices
dominating
smooth
creamy
mouth
feel
with
slight
booziness
on
the
breathe
after
a
sip
warming
notes
of
eastcoasty
hops
floral
pungent
slightly
citric
with
belgian
spices
and
yeast
very
much
involved
hops
prevailing
on
the
finish
best
brew
i
have
had
in
awhile
very
glad
i
chose
this
o
overall
i
really
like
this
one
probably
enjoyed
it
more
on
tap
than
out
of
the
bottle
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
again
this
could
be
my
favorite
brew
from
flying
dog
besides
gonzo
oa
decent
beer
but
it
just
seemed
like
there
could
have
been
a
little
something
more
to
be
honest
this
one
is
bit
too
bitter
not
much
but
the
first
sips
are
bitter
after
that
the
beer
grows
on
you
and
the
bitterness
fades
away
on
cask
at
tap
and
mallet
this
beer
is
one
of
if
not
actually
my
favorite
belgian
ipas
super
hopforward
but
doesnt
overpower
the
belgian
flavor
the
bready
malts
provide
a
nice
backbone
to
all
the
flavors
bouncing
around
just
a
great
example
of
a
bipa
and
an
awesome
beer
allaround
o
flying
dog
makes
some
good
stuff
but
this
is
underwhelming
its
far
from
undrinkable
but
theres
no
single
redeeming
positive
either
id
like
this
to
either
assert
its
hopboozebomb
traits
or
aim
for
a
more
complex
blend
of
belgian
and
american
flavors
this
is
caught
unfavorably
inbetween
m
pretty
standard
carbonation
is
medium
initial
feel
is
very
smooth
medium
body
overall
on
cask
pretty
straight
forward
with
a
mild
body
and
big
chewy
malt
and
hint
of
hop
goodness
on
the
finish
to
give
a
sense
of
ipa
fun
this
is
a
lovely
beer
its
pretty
much
a
light
american
ipa
that
is
spliced
with
the
interest
and
roundness
of
belgian
yeast
to
give
it
something
surprising
a
very
clear
exemplar
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
overall
a
very
tasty
and
solid
take
on
an
ipa
the
spicy
yeast
and
american
hops
make
for
a
nice
combination
o
im
loving
this
beer
especially
as
it
warms
up
for
a
beer
that
incorporates
ingredients
and
flavors
that
can
easily
run
wild
and
take
over
a
delicate
balance
is
achieved
and
makes
this
one
very
memorable
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
a
pretty
good
beer
if
you
like
ipas
and
are
in
the
mood
for
one
with
a
nice
twist
to
it
definitely
worth
tasting
if
given
the
chance
smoother
than
expected
and
of
a
style
i
drink
rarely
this
is
a
good
brew
dry
finish
with
a
nice
grapefruit
linger
medium
bodied
though
leaning
fuller
lightish
effervescence
though
prominent
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
to
start
warming
in
the
throat
a
good
brew
to
be
sure
but
the
abv
says
just
one
son
overall
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
beer
and
it
made
for
a
pretty
good
first
experience
with
a
belgian
ipa
since
this
was
my
first
belgian
ipa
i
was
unsure
of
how
the
belgian
yeast
would
work
with
a
hop
forward
beer
and
i
was
pretty
happy
with
how
well
the
two
went
together
and
i
will
for
sure
be
looking
to
try
more
of
this
style
i
thought
that
the
alcohol
was
hidden
pretty
well
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
but
i
think
two
in
one
sitting
would
be
my
limit
the
things
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
its
appearance
aroma
and
mouthfeel
they
were
all
awesome
and
very
well
done
i
liked
the
sweetness
and
the
lesser
presence
that
the
citrus
hops
had
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
least
but
that
would
be
borderline
nitpicking
i
would
for
sure
buy
a
four
pack
of
this
sometime
its
a
nice
change
from
your
average
ipa
i
think
this
beer
is
for
sure
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
love
ipas
so
pick
this
one
up
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
it
seems
like
all
the
beers
i
have
had
from
the
canis
major
series
have
all
been
a
step
above
flying
dogs
regular
lineup
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
i
am
glad
flying
dog
stuck
it
to
the
man
and
got
their
beer
into
the
hands
of
the
people
in
michigan
that
want
it
i
admire
them
for
that
and
i
wish
more
brewerys
were
as
passionate
about
their
beer
as
flying
dog
is
overallthis
is
probably
not
what
most
people
are
looking
for
in
an
ipa
but
i
love
it
its
balanced
tasty
and
refreshing
if
youre
looking
for
something
outside
the
norm
in
ipas
this
is
it
this
is
a
good
ipa
if
youre
looking
for
classic
east
coast
qualities
blended
with
belgian
notes
the
beer
is
a
bit
extreme
borderline
imperial
and
i
know
of
a
few
states
that
have
banned
the
beer
because
of
the
bottle
artwork
overall
its
not
bad
a
lively
grapefruit
flash
up
front
leads
the
flavor
profile
with
a
nicely
married
hop
presence
accenting
the
grain
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
back
palate
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
well
balanced
ipa
that
is
so
smooth
on
the
tongue
the
high
gravity
is
hardly
noticeable
seems
almost
too
clean
though
and
not
so
raging
o
a
solid
take
on
the
style
i
was
actually
expecting
this
one
to
lean
more
towards
and
american
style
ipa
than
it
did
drinkability
is
good
4
0
overall
if
youre
still
new
to
belgian
style
ipas
i
bet
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
raging
bitch
dont
let
the
name
and
uh
anatomically
disturbing
dog
on
the
label
turn
you
off
this
dogll
hunt
im
glad
i
made
myself
give
this
a
go
before
flying
dog
disappears
from
the
shelves
in
my
hometown
raging
bitch
pours
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
copper
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
estery
with
some
nice
tropical
fruit
and
a
undertone
of
a
medicinal
phenolic
character
hidden
under
the
yeasty
aroma
is
a
nice
herbal
and
slightly
citric
hoppiness
the
spicy
sweet
esters
dominate
the
flavor
but
after
the
estery
sweetness
fades
quickly
and
the
hops
are
become
apparent
they
are
herbal
and
earthy
with
hints
of
pine
and
citrus
some
bready
malt
is
apparent
as
well
there
is
bitterness
and
phenols
linger
in
the
aftertaste
but
the
alcohol
is
hidden
o
different
not
sure
if
its
a
good
different
i
just
dont
think
that
the
belguin
flavors
and
the
ipa
flavors
go
together
that
well
especially
considering
the
very
affordable
pricetag
this
one
is
a
great
gateway
into
belgin
ipas
for
someone
who
doesnt
wish
to
spend
15
on
a
750
of
houblon
chouffe
or
8
on
a
small
piraat
o
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
a
while
and
it
is
about
time
i
got
around
to
reviewing
it
i
consider
this
my
gateway
ipa
please
flying
dog
keep
sending
it
to
texas
o
an
excellent
beer
tastes
amazing
and
its
always
nice
to
have
a
beer
whos
name
was
involved
in
a
court
case
take
that
mi
liquor
control
board
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
and
its
nice
to
see
some
innovation
in
the
style
oan
excellent
beer
the
best
one
ive
had
from
flying
dog
all
the
characteristics
fit
together
almost
perfectly
its
a
bit
pricey
but
if
you
can
fork
out
the
extra
change
it
is
totally
worth
it
overall
really
love
this
beer
fav
offering
from
fd
o
my
first
belgian
ipa
and
it
tasted
good
but
the
over
carbonation
of
this
beer
did
not
quite
work
for
me
i
would
love
to
try
more
of
this
style
though
and
would
be
interested
in
revisiting
this
one
sometime
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
alright
but
i
enjoy
many
of
their
other
beers
more
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
this
again
for
myself
maybe
for
an
ipa
party
it
is
pretty
interesting
all
in
all
this
beer
was
outlawed
under
our
michigan
former
governor
due
to
the
name
now
it
is
allowed
to
be
sold
again
and
i
have
to
say
it
is
wonderful
very
impressive
blend
of
2
unique
styles
be
careful
as
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
is
well
worth
the
while
o
nice
beer
to
shake
things
up
i
would
have
again
but
i
would
have
trouble
downing
a
6pack
of
this
in
an
appropriate
amount
of
time
the
beer
appears
amber
and
clear
atop
the
fermented
beverage
sits
an
inch
of
dense
head
that
leaves
copious
residue
about
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
brings
spice
pepper
yeast
hops
and
alcohol
the
flavors
are
a
bit
scattered
and
rough
with
too
much
alcohol
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
that
said
the
beer
offers
some
pleasant
spice
and
yeast
character
and
is
certainly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
perhaps
this
was
inspired
by
belgian
ipas
but
raging
bitch
is
not
in
the
same
echelon
with
duvel
tripel
hop
or
houblon
chouffe
a
couple
of
my
favorite
beers
of
this
ilk
overall
a
decent
brew
i
would
try
this
again
overall
a
solid
belgian
ipa
ive
had
this
several
times
before
and
im
sure
ill
have
it
several
more
times
in
the
future
m
carbonation
good
creamy
mouthfeel
present
all
told
not
bad
pours
a
clearish
copper
amber
color
thin
white
head
almost
no
retention
smell
is
initially
of
belgium
yeast
esters
some
banana
spice
oddly
i
dont
get
a
very
over
powering
hop
presence
the
feel
is
medium
some
alcohol
burn
a
little
more
hops
nice
sweet
belgium
yeast
taste
the
taste
is
a
little
different
it
starts
nice
with
some
banana
a
little
sweet
malt
and
ends
with
a
decent
hop
presence
and
an
okay
bitter
after
flavor
which
seems
slightly
off
overall
its
about
what
i
expect
from
flying
dog
ive
had
three
of
their
beers
none
were
great
none
were
bad
just
average
overallhavent
had
many
belgian
ipas
but
picked
up
a
bottle
of
la
freak
and
stones
calibelgique
to
drink
this
week
so
i
figured
id
have
another
belgian
today
definitely
not
as
harsh
as
an
american
ipa
but
nicely
balanced
and
refreshing
o
i
wish
the
hops
were
a
bit
more
prominent
but
the
yeast
does
add
a
nice
level
of
complexity
that
works
well
id
get
it
again
d
im
on
the
fence
here
there
are
some
nice
qualities
but
the
overall
flavor
has
some
issues
will
revisit
after
a
year
or
so
to
see
if
the
recipe
has
changed
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
is
a
near
miss
or
a
belly
flop
either
way
this
does
not
diminish
flying
dog
in
my
eyes
they
made
a
weird
beer
but
they
made
it
well
i
liked
most
of
what
this
beer
had
to
offer
except
for
the
aftertaste
i
just
cant
get
past
that
its
a
good
beer
but
not
at
the
14six
pack
price
point
if
you
dislike
the
idea
of
combining
a
belgian
and
an
ipa
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
i
hated
it
the
first
time
i
tried
it
now
my
fifth
or
sixth
combination
has
grown
on
me
taste
is
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
good
spicy
belgian
yeast
flavor
the
sweetnesa
is
a
bit
too
much
but
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
overall
its
quite
good
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
hops
very
well
balanced
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
for
an
ipa
o
the
abv
keeps
it
from
being
a
session
beer
but
dang
its
tough
not
to
keep
knocking
this
one
back
probably
the
most
drinkable
ipa
that
ive
gotten
a
hold
of
recently
o
i
like
raging
bitch
and
its
even
better
ontap
definitely
recommended
will
be
looking
for
it
ontap
again
roaring
out
of
the
bottle
you
can
immediately
smell
the
sweet
belgian
malt
but
wait
theres
something
else
there
why
it
is
the
strong
almost
cannibis
aroma
of
high
alpha
american
hops
barking
sharp
orders
to
your
palate
the
two
are
a
match
made
in
bitchdom
the
initial
swig
shows
sharp
resiny
hops
on
the
sides
and
back
on
the
tongue
but
the
candi
sugar
character
slowly
melds
with
that
character
and
settles
into
a
finish
that
is
both
malty
and
hoppy
at
the
same
time
fruity
yeast
esters
a
long
earthy
bitter
finish
round
this
one
out
complex
yet
refreshing
this
one
hides
its
8
attitude
well
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
hue
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
of
red
ale
a
very
stick
lacing
on
the
insides
of
the
pint
glass
it
smells
of
a
fruity
mix
but
i
can
pick
out
the
smell
of
tangerine
on
the
hops
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
is
rather
smoothedout
different
from
many
ipa
styles
the
bitterness
isnt
as
profound
here
rich
in
malt
flavors
the
traces
of
yeast
are
covered
very
well
very
happy
with
this
beer
runs
true
to
its
reviews
and
would
definitely
drink
again
give
this
one
a
try
while
a
bit
crude
and
definitely
from
deep
in
left
field
flying
dog
is
onto
big
things
with
this
one
overall
see
drinkability
m
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
the
bitter
on
the
end
really
builds
if
you
drink
it
relatively
quickly
overall
im
not
particularly
impressed
the
first
whiff
of
this
thing
was
amazing
but
by
the
time
i
actually
stopped
smelling
and
drank
it
i
was
sorely
disappointed
this
has
potential
an
american
ipa
with
belgian
yeasts
but
the
end
result
was
just
nothing
special
mouthfeel
euphoric
cant
wait
to
buy
more
of
this
stuff
and
am
left
wondering
how
thisd
escaped
me
for
so
long
o
surprisingly
drinkable
and
balanced
nothing
exceptional
in
complexity
but
balanced
o
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
and
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
another
bottle
to
try
tasting
the
beer
you
will
be
enjoying
some
banana
peach
and
honey
up
front
in
the
middle
this
flavors
will
be
joint
by
malty
notes
and
brown
sugar
while
towards
the
end
the
great
selection
of
hops
balances
and
finishes
this
beautifully
crafted
ipa
great
beer
must
taste
o
this
just
didnt
seem
to
be
an
ipa
to
me
belgian
or
not
not
very
bitter
very
spicy
rye
like
qualitiesnot
sure
if
it
brewed
with
rye
very
nice
easy
drinking
belgian
beer
slightly
hazed
brassy
amber
with
an
ivory
head
good
retention
very
fruity
like
applesauce
and
pear
juice
with
hints
of
overripe
banana
and
a
bit
of
peach
theres
also
something
distantly
spirituous
like
good
vodka
or
perhaps
limoncello
theres
a
strawberry
and
chopped
cucumber
note
in
there
that
reminds
me
of
pimms
as
well
a
good
mouthful
develops
big
sweetness
cut
off
by
a
quick
sharp
bitterness
of
hops
and
booze
quinine
and
bitter
lemon
musty
yeast
grapefruit
rind
baked
apple
and
burnt
orange
dominate
fading
into
a
green
banana
and
lemon
peel
finish
not
bad
almost
exactly
what
youd
hope
for
in
a
belgianamerican
hybrid
o
as
of
7ish
p
m
on
the
saturday
of
mem
day
weekend
i
have
a
new
favorite
easytofind
american
beer
way
to
go
dogs
i
support
the
brewerys
use
of
the
word
bitch
if
you
are
old
enough
to
buy
beer
then
you
should
have
the
maturity
to
be
okay
with
the
word
bitch
obviously
texas
and
michigan
lack
the
ability
to
see
the
ability
to
see
the
forest
for
the
trees
you
should
google
this
issue
to
understand
more
overall
id
buy
more
when
im
in
the
mood
to
drink
a
flavorful
beer
and
one
that
may
impede
me
pounding
several
more
you
know
when
youve
when
on
a
date
and
you
know
shes
going
to
be
bitch
and
you
got
to
drink
but
are
worried
about
the
drive
home
ooverall
this
beer
is
just
ok
wasnt
too
blown
away
by
it
the
drinkability
saves
this
one
for
me
o
a
very
decent
westcoast
hops
styled
ipa
not
sure
where
the
belgian
enters
in
great
for
the
hopheads
nice
for
an
ipa
high
overall
i
can
tell
this
beer
is
8
3
abv
just
wish
i
could
have
distinguished
a
bit
more
of
the
complexity
i
think
this
style
has
to
offer
o
there
isnt
much
in
the
way
of
depth
to
this
beer
but
it
does
go
down
well
for
a
hop
head
like
myself
alcohol
doesnt
overwhelm
but
i
wish
it
were
a
little
more
balanced
drinkability
fantastic
12
tops
though
8
3
not
a
terrible
beer
not
even
a
mediocre
beer
just
didnt
have
that
true
hybrid
flavor
as
the
name
would
have
suggested
the
beautiful
aroma
and
color
of
this
brew
were
the
highlights
worth
a
try
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
raging
bitch
was
amberorange
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
citrus
hops
with
some
spice
mixed
in
the
taste
was
citrus
hops
upfront
with
plenty
of
malt
and
some
peppery
spice
the
finish
was
semidry
with
residual
hops
pepper
and
throat
warming
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
medium
carbonation
overall
raging
bitch
is
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying
out
really
like
belguims
and
ipas
thought
it
would
be
a
match
made
in
heaven
too
much
asprin
in
the
flavor
the
belguim
aspects
did
not
come
across
great
good
beer
just
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
from
ratings
and
description
i
think
the
smell
was
good
but
it
didnt
impress
after
that
o
probably
the
best
belgian
style
ipa
from
an
american
brewery
that
ive
had
12oz
bottle
nice
pillowy
head
pour
smells
that
of
an
strong
ipa
but
without
the
entire
bitterness
bite
at
the
end
very
drinkable
without
the
big
bite
at
the
end
so
watch
out
on
this
one
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
belgian
influence
on
this
ipa
makes
it
very
enjoyable
one
of
my
new
go
to
beers
o
overall
i
felt
this
was
a
good
bpa
that
blends
the
aspects
of
an
ipa
well
with
elements
that
belgian
style
beers
will
offer
in
my
opinion
id
prefer
the
american
counterparts
but
this
was
good
od
definately
not
to
style
and
not
what
i
would
expect
for
a
style
i
enjoy
i
didnt
mind
it
at
all
but
it
wasnt
what
a
belgian
ipa
typically
represents
overall
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
and
for
the
money
it
is
and
breath
of
fresh
air
however
i
personally
believe
that
the
combination
of
the
two
styles
represented
as
the
hybrid
belgian
ipa
is
a
mistake
ultimately
the
subtleties
of
both
styles
are
lost
leaving
a
confused
beer
the
marriage
of
american
hops
and
belgian
yeast
strains
imho
has
not
been
accomplished
at
a
note
worthy
level
yet
i
hungry
await
the
union
o
overall
this
is
a
good
represenatation
of
the
style
the
noticeable
abv
doesnt
really
work
for
me
though
my
very
first
belgian
ipa
i
really
enjoy
this
one
o
i
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
and
is
what
i
drink
if
i
cant
decide
on
a
belgian
or
ipa
o
this
beer
was
alright
but
not
at
all
what
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
the
abv
really
stuck
out
and
not
always
in
a
good
way
a
nice
try
from
flying
dog
but
i
think
they
missed
the
mark
a
little
bit
i
wish
the
yeast
would
have
come
out
more
than
it
did
or
lack
there
of
o
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
is
a
good
quality
bipa
and
something
id
recommend
to
someone
looking
for
an
american
interpretation
of
the
style
better
then
expected
thumbs
up
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
a
pleasant
creamy
texture
to
it
overall
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
while
it
is
certainly
a
tasty
beer
to
drink
it
doesnt
quite
stand
out
from
a
crowded
market
of
belgianized
american
ales
overall
i
dont
really
care
for
belgian
ipas
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
quite
hoppy
for
a
belgian
style
ipa
in
fact
it
doesnt
remind
me
too
much
of
a
belgian
ipa
o
not
a
bad
brew
a
tad
bitter
for
my
taste
but
drinkable
considering
the
abv
the
appearance
was
nice
the
nose
was
fantastic
and
everything
that
followed
went
down
hill
i
would
have
really
liked
to
see
the
juicy
tropical
flavour
carried
over
into
the
taste
as
well
as
a
stronger
yeast
presence
without
either
and
the
mediocre
mouthfeel
all
thats
left
is
a
fairly
average
beer
its
sad
because
the
brewery
this
comes
from
is
good
and
the
style
is
great
this
didnt
meet
my
expectations
but
id
say
its
still
worth
a
try
seemed
very
similar
to
dubbel
cannon
at
first
sip
which
i
liked
so
i
liked
this
one
as
well
ipa
with
a
twist
poured
the
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
to
find
a
nice
clear
dark
orange
body
with
a
nice
one
inch
head
that
left
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
the
yeast
hops
the
taste
was
interesting
you
get
the
belgian
yeast
first
then
the
bitter
hops
the
drinkability
is
good
its
a
crisp
clean
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
welland
you
would
never
guess
that
the
abv
is
that
high
i
enjoyed
drinking
the
beer
it
was
something
different
but
it
was
enjoyable
this
beer
was
a
nice
treat
dont
think
i
could
down
more
than
two
or
three
in
a
sitting
and
thats
a
good
thing
will
definitely
purchase
this
again
opinion
well
this
is
one
of
the
more
intriguing
beers
i
have
had
from
flying
dog
it
is
an
unusual
mix
of
a
lot
of
things
that
said
it
doesnt
really
do
it
all
very
well
as
the
flavors
and
aromas
seem
to
not
really
get
along
all
that
well
perhaps
if
there
was
a
sour
component
to
it
as
well
that
would
make
it
world
class
to
bring
it
more
on
the
saison
side
of
things
which
is
more
like
what
this
beer
really
is
but
stronger
than
most
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
flying
dog
so
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
on
draft
or
something
but
this
wouldnt
be
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
regularly
but
i
bet
it
would
be
absolutely
excellent
mixed
with
girardin
1800
gueuze
with
about
2025
gueuze
that
dry
lemony
tart
thing
would
probably
really
compliment
this
beer
nicely
either
way
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
an
ipa
variant
that
doesnt
really
acheive
any
significant
belgian
content
im
not
sure
why
people
rave
over
this
one
maybe
its
the
hop
appeal
if
you
want
a
derivative
ipa
then
try
it
i
wouldnt
call
this
bitch
raging
a
little
dry
in
the
finish

didnt

it

i
found
myself
not

and
probably
wont
have
this
beer
again
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
beer
that
was
targeted
to
be
a
belgian
ipa
where
the
grains
worked
reasonably
well
but
the
hops
were

i
find
this
dangerously
drinkable
and
it
seems
like
there
is
a
hint
of
coriander
or
some
other
spice
deep
down
below
the
hops
the
sharpness
of
the
beer
hits
your

follows
up
nicely
with

bold

admit
that
i
initially
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
a
belgianstyle
ipa
i
e
wth
kind
of
marketing
ploy
is
this
it
also
packs
quite
a
punch
so
much
so
that
the
alcohol
is
the
reason
why
i
couldnt
down
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
im
confident
that
there
are
other
beers
that
are
at
the
forefront
of
this
style
but
to
say
that
this
took
me
by
surprise
is
an
understatement
to
warm
up
on
a
nice
fall
night
im
gonna
grab
another
one
of
these
again
and
enjoy
the
marriage
between
the
citrus
and
plum
like
flavors
that
this
beer
has
wonderfully
enjoined
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
new
brews
of
the
year
d
very
refreshing
overall
very
good
beer
overall
it
may
be
a
bit
bitter
for
some
but
i
enjoyed
it
recommended
for
the
hopheads
out
there
wow
i
wasnt
expecting
this
at
all
but
in
a
very
good
way
the
smell
is
over
the
top
hops
i
started
getting
really
excited
after
smelling
this
beer
it
pours
a
nice
copperish
brown
color
with
a
tight
compact
head
so
the
first
taste
is
absolute
ipa
heaven
heavy
grapefruit
pine
and
spice
flavors
the
malt
backbone
supports
the
hops
perfectly
but
still
stays
behind
the
scene
if
you
gave
me
this
and
i
didnt
know
what
it
was
i
would
just
say
it
was
a
fabulous
american
ipa
though
at
8
3
its
a
little
high
for
a
typical
ipa
i
dont
taste
the
alcohol
though
give
this
one
a
shot
it
is
excellent
d
extremely
high
light
tastes
great
cant
go
wrong
here
overall
i
might
be
biased
because
im
not
crazy
about
the
style
but
this
one
didnt
blow
me
away
its
a
good
beer
no
doubt
but
it
just
seemed
like
the
flavours
were
fighting
for
the
spotlight
instead
of
mixing
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
pass
it
up
either
i
dont
see
what
makes
this
a
belgian
ipa
it
is
american
through
and
through
it
is
very
enjoyable
however
what
ever
it
is
called
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
is
well
balanced
and
nuanced
highly
recommended
i
am
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
the
belgian
ipas
the
belgian
spice
and
strong
hops
dont
always
work
but
this
does
overall
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
while
but
didnt
want
a
whole
sixer
finally
found
it
as
a
single
and
jumped
on
it
im
still
not
completely
sold
on
the
style
i
mean
its
not
bad
beer
but
its
nothing
earth
shattering
an
emerging
style
for
sure
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
belgian
in
this
one
i
also
must
mention
that
this
is
the
first
flying
dog
beer
that
ive
considered
worth
repeating
mouthfeel
seems
more
like
a
much
smaller
beer
and
the
wellhidden
heat
seems
to
confirm
that
this
is
much
lower
in
alcohol
content
finishes
nicely
albeit
aggressively
with
the
high
carbonation
pulling
the
hotter
flavors
away
from
the
palate
well
done
and
in
the
upper
echelon
of
the
style
though
not
quite
elite
listed
by
the
brewer
as
an
american
style

the
add
of
belgian
yeast

holds
up
as
a

nice
from
beginning
to

very
drinkable
lives
up
to
the
hoppedup

ipa
expectation
too
harsh
to
be
very
interesting
and
not
really
the
balance
and
complexity
that
this
style
should
be
about
i
wish
belgian
ipa
was
an
official
style
this
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
even
though
it
is
high
in
alcohol
it
doesnt
have
that
alcohol
burn
to
it
its
amazing
how
simple
the
malt
bill
is
on
this
beer
and
yet
how
complex
the
flavor
is
thanks
to
the
el
diablo
yeast
i
think
the
hops
that
the
brewer
used
in
this
beer
pair
very
well
with
each
other
has
a
nice
american
ipa
citrus
flavor
and
aroma
to
it
awesome
beer
flying
dog
dont
go
into
this
beer
expecting
to
be
blown
away
the
aroma
is
a
great
mix
of
the
fruity
belgium
yeast
american
hops
slightly
sweetened
from
the
malt
and
perhaps
at
of
spice
apart
from
that
youre
looking
at
an
above
average
beer
priced
extremely
well
d
its
good
i
like
it
worth
having
and
worth
giving
it
a
try
pours
a
clean
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white

in
the
aroma
grapefuity
hops
and
quite
citrusy
in
the
taste
grapefruit
to
orange
citrus

a
nice
dry
belgian
like
yeast
presence
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
more
a
double
imperial
ipa
than
belgian
love
it
though
fairly
easy
drinker
but
the
high
abv
holds
it
back
a
bit
after
having
this
at
bww
on
tap
i
had
to
get
myself
a
six
pack
this
is
really
a
great
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
at
a
great
price
point
pours

bready

i
really
love
all
the
smells
going
on
here
taste
doesnt
fully
translate
though
on
tap
it
was
a
bit
better
taste
wise
but
theres
still
some
good
ipa
flavors
plenty
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
balance
out
the
sweetness
up
front
mouthfeel
is
good
not
much
to
write
home
about
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
drink
its
sweet
smooth
flavor
is
complimented
by
the
great
feel
of
this
beer
to
create
a
taste
that
i
would
love
to
purchase
again
big
buttery
smooth
mouthfeel
way
too
drinkable
at
over
8
and
totally
worthy
of
representing
flying
dogs
20th
anniversary
imagine
what
theyll
create
for
their
40th
copper
colored
with
a
finger
of
head
leaves
little
lacing
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
a
definitive
alcohol
overtonethat
i
cant
say
i
preferand
yeast
fortunately
the
taste
is
much
better
with
milder
hops
than
im
used
to
in
american
ipas
but
very
tasty
i
read
they
use
american
hops
and
perhaps
they
are
just
very
nicely
balanced
with
more
pale
malts
then
im
used
to
or
perhaps
they
use
the
candied
sugars
often
used
in
belgian
ales
to
increase
the
sweetness
the
yeast
taste
belgian
and
really
just
makes
everything
alright
with
me
when
cold
the
alcohol
is
less
noticeable
but
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
more
obvious
i
like
high
gravity
beers
but
i
prefer
the
alcohol
to
be
more
hidden
but
thats
a
minor
complaint
that
i
feel
a
little
awkward
even
mentioning
the
alcohol
is
more
pronounced
in
the
smell
than
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
or
even
a
little
beyondwith
low
carbonation
leaving
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
buy
this
again
for
sure
drinkability
for
all
its
apparent
bitterness
this
beer
could
easily
qualify
as
a
sessioner
at
8
3
abv
a
short
session
it
would
be
d
im
loving
this
beer
bipas
are
my
favorite
style
and
subtlety
is
my
preference
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
everything
you
could
want
from
an
ipa
and
a
belgian
is
there
blended
together
in
perfect
harmony
here
i
will
definitely
be
getting
another
sixer
of
these
soon
overall
a
killer
beer
would
definitely
have
one
again
when
i
get
the
chance
not
a
beer
you
want
to
start
a
night
of
drinking
on
but
a
great
one
for
a
tasting
d
i
enjoy
this
guy
not
my
fav
style
but
this
is
a
decent
rendition
of
it
nice
unique
mix
of
flavors
for
those
who
get
bored
of
hop
bombs
but
dont
wanna
venture
too
far
a
tasty
treat
d
this
beer
merges
my
two
favorite
styles
and
does
a
fabulous
job
at
it
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
a
great
belgianstyle
beer
just
experienced
stone
vertical
epic
10
and
to
be
honest
reminds
me
a
lot
of
its
taste
belgian
influence
smells
of
grapes
pears
bananas
and
apples
love
it
too
bad
its
just
an
anniversary
ale
good
job
flying
dog
as
much
as
i
enjoy
piraat
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
a
good
beer
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
i
find
ipas
are
hit
or
miss
with
me
d
this
one
is
scary
drinkable
at
its
abv
i
feel
like
i
could
handle
a
sixer
in
one
night
but
itd
also
probably
put
me
on
my
ass
before
i
knew
it
verdict
raging
bitch
is
a
solid
belgian
ipa
and
a
worthy
tribute
to
20
years
of
flying
dog
its
deceptively
drinkable
unique
and
enjoyable
throughout
one
of
the
best
beers
from
this
brewery
id
love
to
see
raging
bitch
make
the
crossover
to
yearly
visitor
sweet
citrus
up
front
followed
by
piney
hop
bitterness
finnishing
with
grapefruit
it
has
a
candied
sweetness
in
the
back
and
some
sweet
orange
this
beer
really
wrecks
your
palate
and
your
mouth
loves
every
minute
of
it
the
mouthfeel
of
this
offering
is
quite
pleasant
along
with
the
other
components
of
the
beer
there
is
a
smoothness
to
this
beer
that
is
carried
thanks
in
part
to
the
malty
parts
of
the
beer
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
ideally
be
present
in
this
beer
and
if
there
was
that
added
bit
of
carbonation
that
appears
to
be
missing
this
beer
would
be
just
all
that
much
better
d
great
drinkability
for
an
8
3
abv
deceptive
even
d
fair
to
good
this
is
a
rather
big
beer
so
i
would
have
only
one
or
two
3
5
it
is
very
drinkable
and
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
and
a
great
value
it
was
only
9
bucks
for
a
six
pack
i
will
drink
this
regularly
aroma
is
woo
wee
strong
seriously
hoppy
with
a
strong
citrus
tone
that
is
a
mixture
of
good
grapefruit
and
sweet
orange
it
pours
a
nice
clear
orange
amber
with
an
average
pale
tan
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
flavor
is
quite
hoppy
with
a
good
evergreen
tone
minimal
bitterness
and
an
undertone
of
grapefruit
with
just
a
whisper
of
sweetness
texture
is
rough
and
edgy
leaving
behind
a
fair
tingle
considering
my
bellow
average
review
im
thinking
i
maybe
got
a
bad
batch
overall
a
very
solid
beer
i
havent
had
a
flying
dog
beer
in
quite
some
time
but
thought
it
was
time
to
give
them
another
go
definitely
worth
a
go
cheers
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
kind
of
a
new
taste
to
me
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
bodied
bitey
bitter
sweet
pungent
and
sticky
d
great
beer
here
and
the
8
3
abv
is
practically
undetectable
enjoy
with
caution
impression
not
a
huge
fan
of
fd
but
this
one
is
quite
tasty
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
going
into
it
it
just
tasted
too
creamy
for
my
taste
i
got
a
lot
of
caramel
and
not
much
else
it
was
nice
and
smooth
with
very
little
hops
but
it
just
did
not
wow
me
like
other
flying
dog
beers
i
think
it
has
potential
might
just
need
to
open
up
a
little
bit
this
one
poured
light
and
auburn
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
it
definitely
smelled
more
like
a
belgian
than
an
ipa
it
had
good
yeasty
aromas
with
some
light
maltiness
it
didnt
feature
hoppiness
or
alcohol
at
all
the
taste
was
excellent
again
it
was
heavier
on
the
belgian
side
it
featured
a
good
mix
of
breadiness
with
sugars
and
some
light
alcohol
on
the
backend
the
mouthfeel
was
light
crisp
and
well
carbonated
i
really
liked
this
one
and
i
found
it
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
other
belgian
ipas
this
one
certainly
is
closer
to
a
belgian
than
an
ipa
d
this
is
a
extremely
drinkable
brew
light
on
the
palate
and
nonfilling
i
have
kicked
through
most
of
the
bottle
just
going
back
to
gain
a
new
light
on
the
complexity
of
flavors
a
tasty
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
good
hop
profile
pairing
with
yeast
worth
trying
raging
bitch
pours
a
deep
amber
color
without
much
of
a
head
the
hoppy
bite
is
apparent
from
both
the
nose
and
from
the
first
sip
however
the
hoppiness
does
wear
off
as
the
drink
goes
on
and
the
flavor
goes
from
biting
to
smooth
yet
strong
even
though
hoppy
beers
are
not
my
thing
this
is
still
a
very
solid
and
great
beer
and
have
no
complaints
try
it
if
you
can
the
alcohol
comes
through
more
than
the
hops
in
this
one
this
is
a
fairly
good
brew
but
maybe
an
acquired
taste
it
is
certainly
a
great
example
of
flying
dogs
ingenuity
and
great
to
celebrate
20
years
serving
type
chilled
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
all
in
all
not
a
bad
job
flying
dog
hopshappiness
i
wasnt
sure
about
the
hoppiness
at
first
but
a
few
sips
in
i
realized
it
want
as
overpowering
as
i
thought
the
8
alcohol
was
apparent
as
i
caught
a
buzz
a
few
sips
into
the
second
bottle
and
just
as
i
realized
what
a
good
taste
this
had
just
hard
to
drink
in
mixed
coed
company
with
a
name
like
raging
bitch
not
many
know
the
dog
reference
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
raging
bitch
is
a
clear
copperorange
color
almost
like
apple
juice
with
a
onefinger
soapy
white
head
the
nose
has
some
spicy
peppery
characteristics
as
well
as
some
piney
citrusy
west
coast
hops
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
belgian
characteristics
being
more
reserved
and
the
west
coast
ipa
flavors
being
dominant
fruitiness
like
apricot
and
grapefruit
along
with
resinous
pine
make
up
most
of
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
would
like
to
see
more
belgian
in
the
flavor
but
certainly
not
a
bad
attempt
d
i
didnt
really
expect
the
flavors
to
work
with
this
beer
but
it
really
does
very
balanced
the
alcohol
becomes
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
but
nothing
over
the
top
id
drink
a
glass
of
it
maybe
two
but
thats
about
it
because
the
alcoholic
flavors
would
get
to
me
a
bit
a
very
good
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
i
might
pick
this
one
up
again
sometime
cheers
despite
its
abv
its
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
what
it
is
im
liking
this
a
lot
well
done
beer
d
a
little
too
much
spice
to
drink
much
of
but
a
good
beer
and
interesting
style
nonetheless
nice
job
and
i
love
the
name
pours
with
a
deep
rich
goldenamber
color
with
a
surprisingly
small
amount
of
head
for
the
style
unless
i
just
did
a
crappy
job
pouring
it
not
a
very
big
hop
presence
in
the
aroma
but
i
do
detect
hints
of
vanilla
and
peach
the
peach
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
instead
of
a
citrusy
hop
character
the
finish
is
extremely
smooth
for
an
ipa
a
really
great
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
d
very
although
the
abv
is
high
went
by
pretty
much
unnoticed
this
is
a
very
good
bipa
full
of
hop
character
wiht
a
malt
body
and
yeast
profile
right
out
of
belgium
a
very
cloudy
burnt
orange
with
a
yellowish
off
white
head
a
good
size
head
and
considerable
lacing
smell
is
a
rich
pale
malt
and
belgian
yeast
some
funk
and
a
piney
hops
with
a
banana
tinged
fruitiness
taste
is
bam
bam
hoppy
with
a
grapefruit
and
pine
right
away
followed
by
an
oily
hop
leafyness
then
you
get
a
tripel
like
malt
backbone
and
a
return
to
grapefruit
with
caramel
sweetness
some
more
of
that
faint
banana
finish
is
very
dry
and
clean
with
an
astringent
touch
of
hop
oil
lingering
no
trace
of
alcohol
anywhere
feel
is
crisp
and
effervescent
with
an
almost
cream
like
quality
this
is
a
real
sneaky
one
to
drink
as
it
goes
down
like
a
milder
mannered
ipa
with
all
the
smooth
complexity
of
a
belgian
ales
a
real
gem
of
a
beer
and
one
i
plan
to
keep
on
hand
raging
bitch
is
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
better
than
usual
from
flying
dog
and
once
again
shows
like
gonzo
that
these
guys
can
really
put
out
a
solid
drink
when
they
want
to
id
love
it
if
they
made
this
a
seasonal
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
encountered
and
worth
the
trip
to
track
it
down
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
not
great
but
worth
trying
definitely
suits
a
belgian
ipa
category
d
a
nice
brew
highly
hopped
is
its
claim
to
fame
the
belgian
side
of
this
bitch
is
very
subtle
and
i
would
like
to
get
to
know
that
side
better
all
the
assertive
bitterness
seems
to
mask
the
yeast
decently
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
beer
but
im
not
sure
i
would
call
her
my
bitch
just
that
bitch
d
its
not
much
of
a
belgian
or
much
of
an
ipa
but
it
has
enough
of
both
to
make
it
worthwhile
very
drinkable
perhaps
too
much
so
at
8
3
you
taste
none
of
the
alcohol
d
you
dont
feel
the
alcohol
but
it
doesnt
mean
it
isnt
there
this
is
a
really
really
good
beer
and
if
i
wasnt
driving
id
defiantly
have
a
few
of
these
drinkability
great
d
can
i
just
leave
it
at
great
no
doesnt
hop
me
out
after
one
and
this
is
my
second
attempt
at
the
bitch
she
is
quite
the
partner
for
an
evening
and
id
love
to
tempt
her
company
once
more
cheers
drinkabilty
a
different
beer
a
nice
change
from
a
hop
driven
ipa
or
a
standard
tripel
not
sure
i
would
drink
a
whole
6pack
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
for
sure
this
one
trends
more
into
the
belgian
realm
than
many
of
these
newfangled
american
brewed
belgioipas
yeast
first
hops
second
i
like
that
both
are
assertive
though
and
are
draped
with
a
caramel
toffee
malt
backdrop
that
i
could
probably
do
without
almost
too
much
going
on
here
with
the
beastly
malt
does
not
seem
to
have
a
focal
point
throw
alcohol
up
in
there
and
you
got
a
fourheaded
bitch
on
your
hands
kerberos
watch
out
rough
around
the
edges
but
this
dog
is
ultimately
petable
when
all
is
said
and
done
pours
very
foamy
head
on
deep
yellow
yeasty
aroma
its
evena
little
funky
creamy
mouthfeel
major
bitterness
yet
somewhat
offset
good
for
the
belgian
ipa
style
the
palate
needs
some
time
to
recover
dcent
drinkability
orange
citrus
surprising
alcohol
that
hits
you
later
well
done
one
minor
complaint
some
of
my
family
is
a
little
too
politically
correct
and
i
would
feel
uneasy
bringing
this
drink
around
especially
if
kids
may
be
around
d
alcohol
content
is
higher
than
standard
ipa
but
its
not
present
in
the
taste
proper
glassware
and
temperature
give
a
certain
degree
of
balance
very
drinkable
considering
the
thickness
hop
presence
and
alcohol
content
ive
been
tempted
to
make
a
session
of
it
but
usually
talk
myself
out
of
it
on
account
of
the
high
abv
this
beer
had
the
pleasure
of
being
my
very
first
ipa
and
i
was
not
disappointed
beautiful
pour
with
a
nice
pillowy
head
i
could
not
wait
to
dig
in
has
a
really
great
fruity
aroma
that
just
permeated
through
the
whole
tasting
i
loved
the
lingering
bitterness
that
just
keeps
building
as
you
drink
it
flying
dog
has
a
winner
with
this
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
probably
flying
dogs
best
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
full
spicy
hops
flavor
with
a
great
depth
and
it
blends
well
with
the
saison
style
yeast
the
fizz
is
a
bit
overpowering
in
the
finish
but
it
does
enhance
the
hops
character
d
if
you
ever
want
to
try
the
perfect
example
of
a
belgian
ipa
this
is
it
great
taste
and
will
definately
get
again
i
actually
preferred
the
bottle
version
of
this
much
better
and
found
it
to
be
a
lighter
style
ipa
which
was
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
the
flavors
are
quite
complex
and
in
this
case
i
believe
the
belgian
yeast
and
american
hop
characteristics
meld
well
together
my
favorite
belgian
style
ipa
first
time
i
had
it
i
pretty
much
thought
it
was
a
american
ipa
labeled
as
a
belgian
ipa
just
to
garner
attention
after
trying
it
a
few
times
i
can
see
why
it
has
such
label
no
question
my
favorite
flying
dog
brew
pretty
cheap
too
this
beer
surpassed
my
expectations
a
great
beer
and
sure
does
go
down
easy
for
8
3
alcohol
d
my
favorite
six
pack
buy
for
the
price
hoppy
and
fruity
well
balanced
and
a
desirable
abv
one
of
my
favorite
beers
since
release
good
pricing
good
on
style
and
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
loved
this
beer
very
good
mashup
of
the
two
styles
good
maltiness
balanced
out
by
the
grapefruit
of
the
hops
the
belgian
spice
come
through
next
followed
by
the
yeasts
the
nose
is
pretty
great
too
again
a
blend
of
two
styles
paired
very
well
mda
little
light
in
the
body
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
dry
and
wanting
another
drink
i
sat
down
to
casually
drink
my
glass
and
it
was
gone
before
i
noticed
pours
a
nice
reddishamber
hue
aromas
of
grapefruit
and
piney
hop
mouthfeel
is
silky
with
a
dry
finish
nice
balance
with
a
bright
citrus
flavor
belgian
yeast
comes
through
with
just
the
right
sweetness
to
balance
the
amarillowarrior
hop
overload
overall
a
tasty
brew
dare
i
say
sessionable
at
8
3
abv
d
moderate
to
low
assertive
bitterness
chips
away
at
the
palate
while
the
abv
chips
away
at
your
mind
flying
dog
raging
bitch
is
a
super
clear
amber
ale
with
a
soft
thin
dense
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
leaves
thick
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
very
grassy
aroma
with
a
note
of
fresh
earth
it
smells
like
outdoors
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
with
a
dry
finish
it
has
a
nice
grassy
bitterness
and
its
very
fruity
with
notes
of
peach
and
stone
fruit
the
finish
is
bitter
and
phenolic
its
very
tasty
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
the
beer
pours
deep
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
is
prevelant
with
some
floral
hop
notes
taste
is
bready
malts
combined
with
the
belgain
yeast
and
grapefuity
american
hops
has
an
overall
dry
finish
with
a
little
alcohol
at
the
end
overall
a
goodbalanced
americanized
version
of
a
belgain
classic
that
is
very
drinkable
the
balance
between
hop
bitterness
malty
sweetness
and
the
spicy
yeasts
are
close
to
perfect
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
belgian
ipa
and
with
the
slightly
higher
abv
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
exactly
what
i
would
expect
a
belgian
ipa
to
be
the
fruitiness
of
a
belgian
golden
or
triple
ale
combined
with
the
similar
but
different
malt
aspects
of
an
ipa
and
a
nice
us
style
hops
kick
the
alcohol
esters
also
add
to
the
belgian
aspect
of
the
beer
it
is
pulled
off
as
well
as
any
hybrid
in
this
style
as
i
have
ever
tried
good
work
flying
dog
you
have
seem
to
gotten
over
the
quality
issues
i
used
to
associate
you
with
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
drinkable
beer
i
am
starting
to
warm
to
this
style
i
like
this
one
the
most
when
its
colder
it
keeps
more
of
the
best
flavors
present
the
intensity
of
the
bitterness
slows
the
drinking
some
and
limits
the
desire
to
indulge
in
the
next
having
said
that
this
is
unique
and
good
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
its
a
great
example
of
a
complex
ipa
which
i
really
wish
would
become
a
regular
in
their
lineup
however
the
abv
ensures
that
one
or
two
is
all
one
needs
at
a
time
raging
bitch
20th
anniversary
was
almost
too
good
and
i
was
not
let
down
at
all
while
drinking
it
hopfest
may
be
technically
located
in
madison
county
ny
but
yesterday
at
approximately
1239pm
it
was
in
my
glass
i
will
definitely
pursue
this
beer
in
the
future
orange
copper
body
thin
off
white
head
lacing
is
minimal
aroma
is
juicy
hops
and
cakey
belgian
yeast
flavor
is
balanced
nicely
with
resinous
and
grassy
hops
blending
in
with
the
bready
malts
and
estery
belgian
yeastiness
solid
flavor
and
a
bit
unique
compared
to
other
belgian
ipas
ive
had
in
the
flying
dog
line
of
exceptionally
middleoftheroad
brews
this
is
king
d
like
i
said
drink
this
sumbitch
with
a
hearty
steak
i
had
a
six
pack
between
3
people
over
some
nice
steaks
that
had
been
marinating
in
a
gingersoycitrus
marinade
for
a
day
damn
not
my
favorite
version
of
the
style
but
a
decent
beer
it
isnt
the
least
drinkable
ipa
ive
ever
had
but
its
certainly
not
the
most
either
one
of
these
per
session
is
plenty
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
the
herb
character
very
nearly
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
beer
if
that
was
toned
down
i
think
this
brew
would
be
a
real
winner
but
as
it
stands
i
think
one
six
pack
is
all
ill
be
buying
drinkability
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
a
belgianstyle
ipa
and
i
havent
had
many
but
this
is
what
i
think
an
ipa
really
should
be
this
has
mostly
very
unique
hoppy
flavors
though
they
arent
extremely
overwhelming
or
bitter
not
necessarily
balanced
but
this
is
very
hoppy
while
not
overwhelming
highly
recommended
very
drinkable
for
its
abv
though
the
hop
profile
makes
it
more
of
a
savory
beer
d
not
bad
for
a
belgium
ipa
definitely
worth
the
7
99
price
tag
ive
had
better
belgian
ipas
but
this
is
a
good
deal
for
the
price
fresh
and
bright
balanced
and
just
supergood
hell
yeah
no
need
to
say
more
d
amazing
for
an
ipa
i
want
ten
more
right
now
d
very
easy
to
drink
silky
smooth
definitely
picking
this
up
again
sometime
pours
a
dark
golden
with
little
head
and
what
head
there
is
fades
away
to
a
swirl
smells
peppery
dry
and
herbal
upfront
followed
by
a
little
belgian
yeast
clove
and
sweetness
more
pepperiness
and
herbalness
in
the
taste
plus
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
almost
spicy
a
little
too
austere
and
hot
but
not
bad
slightly
tangy
in
the
mouth
dry
and
herbal
pretty
decent
effort
here
this
is
a
very
drinkable
big
beer
this
is
my
second
go
around
with
it
and
i
genuinely
know
that
glassware
makes
a
big
difference
the
brew
looks
way
better
then
my
previous
review
the
brew
at
this
point
has
a
different
taste
as
well
not
sure
if
it
is
because
of
the
glassware
as
well
good
stuff
a
fine
example
for
the
style
and
drinks
wonderfully
well
hidden
alcohol
a
solid
brew
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
8
3
abv
is
hidden
well
drinkability
good
a
nice
hazy
amber
color
with
a
solid
white
foam
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
very
scrumptious
bready
pine
hop
with
a
floral
toasted
malt
complement
the
first
taste
says
yeasty
pine
hop
with
some
juniper
and
raspberry
highlights
medium
plus
bodied
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
and
a
light
syrupy
feel
its
very
drinkable
and
likable
with
the
vague
belgian
hints
presented
in
a
slightly
sweet
and
edible
form
would
gladly
revisit
any
time
nice
job
dog
drinks
very
easy
abv
is
well
hidden
i
do
find
the
belgian
aspects
of
this
a
bit
restrained
still
a
winner
d
it
wasnt
too
difficult
to
drink
this
beer
because
the
alcohol
was
well
masked
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
if
i
saw
it
on
cask
because
it
was
silky
smooth
d
delicious
beer
i
would
drink
a
barrel
12
oz
poured
into
a
stone
i
r
s
tulip
it
pours
an
astonishingly
clear
sweet
tea
red
with
a
small
head
the
nose
is
rather
funky
with
the
combination
of
belgian
yeast
and
american
hops
the
taste
is
floral
and
citrusy
with
some
sweetness
but
it
ends
dry
and
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
thick
and
lingers
this
is
a
tough
one
to
place
its
good
but
not
worthy
of
buying
a
whole
sixpack
raging
bitch
has
supplanted
gonzo
imperial
porter
as
my
new
flying
dog
favorite
pours
hazy
the
color
of
dull
apricots
with
a
big
offwhite
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
properties
an
interesting
nose
with
lots
of
grapefruit
and
general
fruit
basket
smells
up
front
giving
way
to
lots
of
bready
malts
and
cloves
the
full
heavy
body
pounds
the
flavors
home
initially
bitter
the
lemon
notes
slowly
sweeten
to
grapefruit
and
then
sweeten
more
to
reveal
multiple
layers
of
complex
fruit
spices
and
herbs
theres
a
lot
happening
here
perfect
food
beer
or
all
on
its
own
d
love
this
stuff
and
cant
believe
the
8
3
abv
an
amazing
beer
from
a
brewery
i
once
thought
average
at
best
be
prepared
it
does
go
down
easy
and
the
8
3
will
sneek
up
on
you
overall
a
nice
beer
would
not
mind
to
drink
it
again
another
great
beer
from
flying
dog
maybe
the
best
ive
tasted
from
them
im
a
hop
head
so
i
love
the
hoppy
flavor
of
the
beer
and
the
kick
it
delivers
is
great
smooth
strong
great
flavor
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
which
may
turn
off
some
but
for
me
i
dont
mind
at
all
i
find
myself
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
this
nearly
every
weekend
if
you
love
hops
and
love
a
good
kick
with
the
great
aroma
and
taste
of
hops
then
this
is
your
beer
overall
a
superior
example
of
the
style
things
area
bit
ragged
for
this
old
dog
more
ipa
than
b
elgique
an
american
in
brussels
the
daisy
miller
of
beers
caught
a
yeast
infection
at
the
coliseum
worth
it
for
the
money
enjoyable
if
un
cultured
shout
out
to
ryan
of
pleasant
ridge
for
the
bottle
this
could
easily
be
a
sneaky
snake
d
overall
i
usually
think
this
is
the
best
beer
fd
makes
however
i
dunno
if
the
bottles
old
or
what
but
im
not
feeling
it
as
much
this
evening
as
i
have
in
the
past
it
is
a
very
good
beer
and
a
great
mashup
of
a
belgian
pale
and
an
ipa
one
ive
enjoyed
greatly
while
its
been
available
this
needs
to
be
brewed
yearround
clear
orangeamber
colour
with
a
thin
layer
of
white
bubbles
coating
the
surface
of
the
beer
shortlived
streaky
lacing
and
decent
head
retention
caramel
and
toasted
bread
in
the
aroma
fruity
and
powdery
a
bit
yeasty
the
flavour
was
surprisingly
mild
and
balanced
i
was
expecting
something
more
bombastic
malty
and
fruity
up
front
a
bit
of
alcohol
some
citrus
and
spice
towards
the
end
along
with
sugary
sweetness
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
and
somewhat
quick
finish
pretty
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
light
peppery
warmth
a
bit
dry
medium
to
full
bodied
with
lowish
nearly
creamy
carbonation
i
liked
this
and
enjoyed
it
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
in
the
fridge
d
overall
a
good
beer
from
flying
dog
could
have
a
couple
of
these
before
the
sweetness
got
to
me
great
midamber
color
with
a
wonderful
aroma
it
has
a
very
good
hoppy
flavor
with
a
smooth
finish
that
is
neither
too
harsh
on
the
pallet
nor
to
light
for
a
good
belginstyle
ipa
very
drinkable
and
i
would
recommend
trying
this
one
out
this
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
flying
dog
drinkability
goes
down
fast
for
a
high
gravity
hoppy
dry
concoction
overall
pretty
much
what
i
expected
from
flying
dog
in
all
that
entails
t
very
intense
explosion
of
flavor
bitter
hops
has
an
almost
saison
after
taste
which
makes
sense
because
of
the
belgian
aspect
i
know
a
beer
should
be
judged
by
what
is
inside
the
bottle
but
ive
always
found
myself
turnedoff
by
flying
dogs
rather
frightening
label
art
and
general
attitude
the
name
and
label
art
on
this
beer
are
disturbing
but
with
the
beer
receiving
consistent
high
marks
i
decided
to
give
it
a
chance
pour
was
a
beautiful
vibrant
ambercopper
aroma
was
both
belgian
funk
and
hops
flavor
was
redolent
of
fruity
belgian
yeast
notes
carried
on
a
substantial
current
of
hops
a
big
beer
with
a
big
abv
to
match
etoh
was
moderately
evident
at
the
finish
the
belgianipa
marriage
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
tricky
proposition
like
paring
sweet
and
salty
the
balance
has
to
be
just
right
here
the
two
flavor
profiles
seemed
to
retain
a
consistent
distinction
like
drinking
a
halfandhalf
of
each
style
it
never
quite
came
together
for
me
done
of
fds
best
right
up
there
with
gonzo
for
a
brewery
with
a
lot
of
meciocrity
i
do
like
this
one
for
sure
most
evenings
when
i
have
a
raging
bitch
i
only
have
one
or
two
then
shift
to
a
lighter
flavor
but
this
unique
robust
brew
would
be
an
excellent
first
beer
on
most
any
evening
enjoyed
this
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
it
is
billed
as
a
belgian
ipa
the
color
is
copper
and
clear
and
the
head
was
average
aromas
included
mild
banana
and
a
somewhat
floral
hoppiness
the
taste
was
an
unusual
combination
of
strong
bananaclove
and
up
front
bitterness
there
was
some
maltiness
noticeable
underneath
but
it
was
not
a
large
component
of
the
taste
the
menu
claimed
an
abv
of
8
3
but
i
did
not
notice
an
alcohol
flavor
nicely
hoppy
stiff
hop
oils
some
leafy
freshness
peppery
phenols
and
spices
notably
menthol
and
perpaps
some
mustard
greens
mild
malt
noticable
through
hoppage
moderate
bitterness
finishes
hoppy
dry
tastes
good
feels
good
good
drinkability
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smells
of
freshly
cut
grass
and
heated
plastic
lol
in
a
good
way
taste
is
cinnamon
up
front
with
a
grape
juice
middle
and
a
phenolic
clovey
medicinal
finish
piney
hops
are
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
bitterness
that
clings
to
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
the
beers
lowest
point
though
as
the
high
alcohol
and
intense
flavors
make
this
a
sipper
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
though
notes
i
nor
brett
who
i
drank
this
with
as
we
brewed
a
pale
ale
can
say
a
single
bad
thing
about
it
i
follow
flying
dog
on
twitter
they
were
posting
like
mad
as
they
brewed
bottled
and
shipped
this
beer
and
i
wanted
a
pint
of
it
every
time
they
posted
and
after
all
of
that
it
lived
up
to
its
hype
great
beer
i
could
really
drink
a
couple
of
these
this
is
the
first
beer
from
flyin
dog
that
i
didnt
hate
perhaps
sampling
it
blind
helped
with
that
d
i
was
stunned
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
very
drinkable
beer
real
good
ipa
hope
it
sucks
around
for
awhile
fd
plenty
of
carbonation
and
fair
crispness
a
good
beer
over
all
but
really
only
one
at
a
time
a
real
palate
burner
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
crystal
clear
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
grapefruit
nose
flavor
is
grapefruit
some
sweet
orange
dry
finish
1
75
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
wow
what
a
great
find
had
heard
a
lot
about
this
one
and
finally
tracked
some
down
pours
a
pale
copper
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
but
leaves
good
lacing
nice
inviting
aroma
of
pine
and
a
little
bit
of
clovy
spice
first
sip
is
a
nice
bitter
crisp
ipa
then
it
turns
to
a
spicy
sweet
belgian
thing
its
really
a
great
combo
of
flavors
a
nice
clean
feeling
in
the
mouth
and
very
easy
to
drink
maybe
too
easy
given
the
8
3
abv
but
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
of
the
style
and
actually
one
of
my
new
favorites
overall
taste
more
hops
leans
to
the
american
side
thankfully
still
has
the
warming
alcohol
presence
and
yeast
fruitiness
on
the
belgian
tip
mouthfeel
rocks
alcohol
feel
fades
more
nuance
of
the
spice
come
on
all
the
right
points
from
both
sides
of
the
pond
11
a
6er
is
actually
pretty
good
for
this
high
quality
product
the
best
thing
flying
dog
has
ever
made
drinkability
for
all
of
the
alcohol
and
ibus
within
it
goes
that
fairly
smooth
while
horn
dog
and
the
seldom
seen
barrelaged
horn
dog
still
remain
the
best
of
show
winners
for
me
this
new
raging
bitch
surely
deserves
a
ribbon
of
its
own
im
knocking
the
mouth
and
drinkability
just
a
touch
for
two
reasons
first
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
much
and
two
these
flavors
just
dont
entirely
place
nicely
as
an
ipa
this
would
be
fantastic
as
a
belgian
ale
these
arent
the
yeastderived
esters
id
be
aiming
for
no
houblon
chouffe
this
but
tasty
drinkability
is
on
the
high
side
for
this
style
for
me
i
can
have
23
without
being
overwhelmed
and
wanting
something
to
reset
my
palete
comparative
to
others
in
this
style
where
i
have
one
and
no
desire
for
another
drinkability
a
sipper
if
not
just
due
to
the
super
bitter
finish
i
like
how
i
can
taste
both
the
belgian
part
and
the
ipa
part
of
this
beer
a
very
well
executed
beer
not
sure
if
it
is
totally
my
style
and
would
get
it
again
however
the
craftmanship
is
excellent
d
goes
down
easily
not
very
feeling
well
balanced
with
a
nice
kick
to
it
i
will
definitely
pick
this
beer
up
again
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
beer
theres
the
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
backed
by
the
perfect
amount
of
flavor
when
i
first
poured
this
beer
i
could
smell
its
aroma
in
the
air
for
anoyone
out
there
who
loves
an
ipa
style
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
enjoy
drinkability
is
surpassingly
high
for
a
beer
with
this
abv
beware
one
of
the
top
beers
from
flying
dogs
lineup
i
believe
very
sessionable
in
spite
of
the
abv
would
easily
pick
up
a
case
of
this
clear
amber
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
dense
head
that
eventually
disappears
honey
berries
and
bananas
comprise
the
sweet
aroma
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
also
noticeable
a
bit
of
carbonation
up
front
on
the
sweet
side
but
with
increasing
bitterness
starting
in
the
middle
by
the
finish
a
battle
ensues
between
the
malt
and
hops
in
the
end
the
hops
win
a
battle
of
attrition
mouthfeel
leaning
on
the
heavy
side
with
a
good
amount
of
body
still
not
convinced
of
this
style
but
yet
again
a
well
put
together
beer
radiant
orange
with
a
creamy
head
and
some
sexy
lace
the
nose
represents
the
belgian
ipa
vibe
well
but
i
cant
help
feel
its
a
clash
rather
than
a
harmony
of
ipa
hops
and
belgian
yeast
goodness
the
ipa
side
of
things
is
winning
over
and
a
nice
ipa
it
wouldve
been
its
a
good
beer
but
i
just
dont
know
when
the
time
is
right
for
this
type
of
beer
i
cant
help
but
wish
it
was
one
or
the
other
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
little
high
on
grapefruit
flavor
and
high
on
alcohol
this
may
not
satisfy
hardcore
belgian
beer
drinkers
consider
this
a
hopped
up
belgian
blonde
but
very
approachable
for
the
rest
of
us
d
the
alcohol
seems
a
bit
more
then
its
advertised
8
3abv
as
well
the
hops
of
60ibu
which
were
quite
dominant
spicy
hoppy
belgian
take
that
will
leave
you
with
a
good
impression
and
wanting
more
pours
a
very
light
clear
amber
color
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
the
smell
is
very
nice
its
definitely
unique
is
it
weird
that
after
i
smell
this
beer
for
the
first
time
i
think
of
the
way
that
saison
du
buff
smelt
had
that
beer
quite
a
while
ago
but
i
get
the
same
herbal
spiciness
to
this
beer
as
well
smells
like
an
herb
garden
with
a
bit
of
hops
and
sweet
malts
initially
i
taste
the
herbs
and
spices
lots
of
oregano
clove
thyme
and
pepper
then
it
gets
very
sweet
and
hoppy
this
beer
is
so
damn
tasty
very
unique
in
my
opinion
the
alcohol
is
extremely
wellhidden
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
perfect
for
this
style
i
could
drink
a
whole
six
pack
of
this
beer
but
would
not
remember
it
my
favorite
beer
flying
dog
has
to
offer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
rock
arts
belgoamerican
ipa
its
a
revelation
a
real
delight
from
flying
dog
pours
a
rather
luminous
dark
honey
color
with
generous
white
head
nose
has
a
bit
of
chalkboard
and
some
background
citrus
palate
has
the
same
chalkboard
like
powerdy
thing
going
on
almost
somewhat
medicinal
like
swallowing
a
tablet
some
dry
grapefruit
is
there
and
a
bit
of
wild
flavors
from
the
yeast
finish
has
that
powdery
taste
too
drinkability
4
out
of
5
other
beers
of
this
style
are
either
too
acidic
or
too
weak
raging
bitch
strikes
the
perfect
balance
its
solid
enough
for
the
serious
beer
drinker
yet
light
enough
to
still
be
enjoyed
by
people
of
more
petite
palettes
at
8
3
percent
its
definitely
smooth
enough
to
have
a
few
and
be
happy
d
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
is
the
tartness
at
the
end
its
otherwise
very
interesting
perhaps
too
interesting
for
drinking
several
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
flying
dog
and
it
has
made
me
want
to
try
some
more
dangerously
smooth
and
delicious
for
a
8
id
petition
to
make
flying
dog
keep
this
yearround
m
again
very
well
done
perfectly
balanced
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
of
this
before
it
goes
away
very
nice
beer
from
flying
dog
let
this
one
warm
up
for
a
while
before
judging
it
gets
dramatically
better
if
you
do
d
i
really
see
no
reason
why
you
couldnt
drink
a
few
of
these
if
you
had
a
ride
home
very
drinkable
but
very
big
at
8
3
i
love
this
bitch
this
is
completely
unusual
to
me
but
not
necessary
in
a
good
way
worth
seeking
out
if
only
to
try
something
new
drinkability
this
was
really
good
i
really
enjoyed
it
at
the
brewery
and
had
such
a
good
time
i
would
love
to
drink
it
again
flying
dog
is
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
dont
care
for
their
marketing
but
i
love
every
beer
i
have
had
d
super
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
complex
yet
accessible
flavor
profile
and
the
consistent
carbonation
d
pretty
damn
versatile
in
drinkability
the
bright
citrus
really
makes
it
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
and
slight
complexity
makes
it
sippable
d
this
is
pretty
good
definitely
different
tasty
refreshing
and
a
lot
of
flavor
notes
love
it
a
superinfusion
of
belgian
yeast
and
american
hopslamming
ingenuity
perhaps
the
best
in
the
style
overall
the
beer
is
pretty
decent
for
its
style
it
is
lacking
a
few
things
and
the
abv
shows
too
much
for
me
i
think
it
is
a
decent
brew
from
flying
dog
but
nothing
i
would
go
crazy
for
to
have
again
decent
drinkability
if
i
can
get
by
the
alcohol
showing
drinks
like
diplomacy
raging
bitch
takes
the
best
from
both
beer
regions
offering
an
interesting
and
welldone
blend
of
american
hops
and
belgian
yeast
md
mouthfeel
seemed
a
bit
thin
to
me
drinkability
is
pretty
good
despite
criticisms
generally
unoffensive
enjoyable
overall
but
not
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
pours
clear
copper
with
a
creamcolored
head
that
sticks
around
tart
yeast
and
some
spicy
dry
malt
on
the
nose
opens
up
quickly
with
lemony
hops
zesty
with
lemon
and
green
hops
over
a
fairly
soft
grainy
malt
bill
yeast
adds
spice
and
zing
finishes
clean
and
softly
bitter
with
lingering
leafy
hops
a
very
drinkable
clean
beer
with
bright
flavors
and
a
soft
mouthfeel
no
houblon
chouffe
but
very
well
done
overall
i
was
pretty
happy
with
it
though
i
didnt
fully
understand
it
id
put
it
above
calibelgique
but
below
houblon
chouffe
this
should
be
the
mold
of
what
belgian
style
ipas
are
made
from
theres
no
denying
this
is
a
strong
pale
ale
you
can
taste
everything
the
hops
malt
wheat
etc
flying
dog
usually
makes
things
strong
this
one
is
no
different
it
was
almost
too
much
ipa
though
but
i
did
have
two
of
them
at
the
bar
pours
a
clear
amber
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
earthy
malt
floral
hops
dark
citrus
slight
alcohol
yeast
and
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
ipa
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
the
mouth
feel
is
also
slightly
watery
tastes
of
sweet
malt
floral
hops
dark
citrus
slight
yeast
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
wood
overall
an
alright
belgian
ipa
good
appearance
aroma
and
blend
md
medium
body
average
carbonation
that
feels
a
little
soft
making
it
feel
smoother
over
the
palate
good
drinkability
since
it
finishes
dry
you
want
another
sip
right
away
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
abv
is
very
well
hidden
the
flavor
is
quite
spicy
as
it
first
hits
my
mouth
but
there
is
also
quite
a
bit
of
fruit
character
here
as
well
this
is
very
herbal
tasting
with
a
substantial
bitterness
and
lots
of
big
pine
like
flavors
the
american
hops
contribute
expressive
flavors
of
lychee
kumquat
and
tangelo
just
underneath
the
herbal
notes
the
finish
has
some
peppery
alcohol
ginger
flavors
and
phenolic
notes
that
lean
more
towards
turpenes
than
the
typical
clove
notes
the
hops
are
actually
heavy
enough
that
they
drown
out
the
fermentation
character
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
fermentation
character
changes
the
emphasis
of
the
hops
here
though
and
i
definitely
like
this
part
of
this
beer
overall
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
standard
flying
dog
lineup
i
do
like
gonzo
and
ba
gonzo
but
this
one
impressed
me
with
its
flavorful
palate
and
drinkability
i
rarely
drink
tripels
never
been
a
big
fan
and
this
certainly
has
a
whole
lotta
tripel
going
on
regardless
this
is
a
monster
of
a
beer
and
i
give
flying
dog
a
lot
of
credit
on
a
fine
brew
very
drinkable
and
not
bad
on
the
pocket
i
hope
this
becomes
a
yearly
offering
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
bottled
31010
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
a
clear
reddishcopper
with
a
nice
frothy
head
and
light
carbonation
fruity
aroma
with
some
phenols
and
light
caramel
taste
notes
of
light
mango
caramel
and
candi
sugar
good
creamy
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
very
good
example
of
the
style
that
i
will
have
to
try
again
conclusion
nowhere
near
la
chouffe
but
fairly
tasty
nonetheless
my
first
bottle
same
sixpack
of
this
was
terrible
like
a
completely
different
beer
i
think
there
must
have
been
an
infection
or
something
else
awry
i
didnt
review
that
one
as
i
was
at
home
wmy
family
and
just
drinking
and
hanging
out
i
almost
gave
the
remaining
five
away
im
glad
i
gave
this
one
another
shot
its
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
fd
a
brewery
im
not
usually
except
for
horn
dog
that
big
of
a
fan
of
d
great
american
hop
taste
combined
with
belgian
golden
ale
flavors
makes
for
a
great
beer
i
hope
flying
dog
decides
to
make
something
like
this
again
belgian
ipa
huh
havent
had
too
many
of
these
before
this
one
is
a
clear
golden
colored
brew
big
creamcolored
head
fluffy
really
bitter
hop
scent
oily
raging
bitch
is
an
apt
moniker
for
this
one
very
bitter
taste
seems
like
the
hops
are
some
that
you
might
find
in
an
american
ipa
but
the
yeast
is
all
belgian
gets
a
bit
spicy
from
the
alcohol
as
it
warms
up
other
spices
as
well
pepper
for
sure
pretty
active
mouth
cool
beer
well
done
d
one
of
my
favorite
in
its
style
i
get
a
few
of
these
every
time
i
go
out
d
very
different
have
not
been
really
big
on
the
us
belgian
ipa
style
as
belgica
was
a
total
letdown
this
is
quite
nice
think
the
mix
of
the
belgian
yeast
and
the
hops
pair
very
well
and
make
this
interesting
as
orange
peach
and
spicy
hops
work
really
well
in
this
abv
is
not
real
noticeable
in
this
until
finishing
the
750
a
well
done
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
current
favorite
of
mine
and
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
loves
hoppy
ipas
great
bright
orange
in
the
glass
the
head
is
fairly
thick
at
first
but
it
falls
somewhat
quickly
to
a
thin
film
the
lace
is
nice
though
the
smell
too
is
good
a
combination
of
west
coast
hops
less
of
the
citrus
and
more
of
the
pine
variety
with
some
belgian
yeast
character
and
spice
so
the
taste
there
is
a
malt
backbone
in
there
somewhere
but
this
beer
is
dominated
by
the
hops
the
belgian
character
is
a
bit
lost
behind
the
hops
which
really
dominate
id
say
there
is
a
small
lack
of
balance
but
its
a
great
ipa
the
body
is
good
and
the
carbonation
is
moderate
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
lasting
bitterness
overall
pretty
good
when
cold
this
beer
is
incredibly
refreshing
the
high
alcohol
and
high
bitterness
dont
detract
from
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
in
any
way
ive
never
tried
any
other
flying
dog
beers
but
have
to
say
that
im
pretty
impressed
by
this
one
a
solid
ipa
with
some
refreshing
belgian
character
overall
a
good
belgian
ipa
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
with
the
a
overall
rating
but
a
solid
beer
from
flying
dog
no
doubt
drinkability
was
good
for
a
strong
beer
i
could
have
enjoyed
another
this
is
what
i
expect
in
a
mixture
of
belgianstyle
beer
and
ipas
light
clear
amber
topped
by
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
thin
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
sweet
aroma
of
caramelized
sugar
apples
soaked
in
liquor
slight
raisin
bread
prunes
the
taste
isnt
as
exciting
as
the
aroma
faint
apple

that
fell
slowly
leaving
some
good
rings
of
lacing
and
had
a

cap
aroma
is
peppery
piny
and
full
of
belgian
yeast
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
a
touch
of
anise
presumably
from
the
yeast
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
evenly
first
thing
that
hits
are
the
spicy
peppery
hops
that
give
off
just
just
a
hint
of
pine
and
herbaceous
qualities
followed
by
a
good
dose
of
caramel
malts
which
are
bready
and
overall
pretty
balanced
i
gotta
say
im
not
a
fan
of
the
spicy
hops
nor
am
i
huge
fan
of
belgian
yeast
being
used
in
ipas
maybe
this
just
isnt
my
style
but
its
hard
for
me
to
really
get
into
this
beer
it
has
some
nice
qualities
but
could
use
a
little
more
citrustropical
hop
flavors
to
balance
the
spiciness
body
is
well
rounded
and
nearly
full
for
the
style
alcohol
isnt
as
present
in
the
taste
as
it
is
in
the
nose
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
favorite
either
still
searching
for
the
belgian
ipa
that
blows
me
away
pours
a
amberishorange
colour
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
like
a
belgian
tripel
that
is
hopped
up
as
youd
expect
with
the
style
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
at
all
nice
belgian
tripel
yeasty
with
the
american
hops
this
beer
is
truly
awesome
i
wish
i
could
get
it
in
ontario
goes
down
ok
the
smoked
meat
flavor
is
not
unwelcome
but
not
offputting
either
pretty
enjoyable
and
this
has
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
by
flying
dog
the
complexity
and
uniqueness
won
me
over
in
the
end
i
cant
see
myself
recommending
this
too
often
but
i
can
see
myself
buying
it
again
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
came
away
fairly
disappointed
it
looks
nice
amberorange
transparent
liquid
with
a
mess
of
fine
white
bubble
on
top
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
orangeyfloralcat
piss
hops
clean
wood
honeyed
malt
and
light
belgian
earth
its
actually
a
tad
boring
for
the
style
to
be
honest
the
taste
is
just
disappointing
theres
a
lot
of
bland
bitterness
from
both
hops
and
wood
ive
never
much
cared
for
amarillo
hops
so
that
could
be
to
blame
but
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
much
going
on
the
more
delicate
hop
notes
have
faded
the
wood
doesnt
provide
much
interest
and
the
yeast
is
understated
for
the
style
its
harsh
on
the
palate
and
drinkability
is
poor
drinkability
ive
had
more
than
one
of
these
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
me
this
is
like
an
american
ipa
fermented
with
belgian
yeast
more
so
than
a
hopped
up
belgian
pale
ale
which
is
good
but
just
a
really
different
kind
of
beer
overall
very
good
bipa
not
the
best
but
damn
good
cheers
to
flying
dog
for
this
one
bitch
please
this
poured
a
nice
gold
with
a
solid
white
head
pretty
clear
with
particulates
floating
around
pears
touch
of
apricots
and
lots
of
citrus
of
the
grapefruitlemon
variety
the
flavor
is
quite
similar
but
less
pears
perhaps
a
hint
of
white
grapes
in
the
finish
along
with
all
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
a
decently
bitter
belgian
beer
i
think
i
could
get
used
to
this
moderate
carbonation
though
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
i
have
to
retry
some
canis
major
beers
double
dog
gonzo
horn
dog
but
until
i
do
this
is
by
far
flying
dogs
best
beer
very
unique
and
good
beer
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
is
a
good
drinker
but
the
booze
is
very
well
hidden
beware
but
enjoy
a
great
brew
that
was
1
95single
good
value
easy
to
drink
good
balanced
flavors
terrific
and
people
have
an
issue
with
the
name
really
buy
this
this
is
my
plea
to
flying
dog
to
make
this
a
year
around
beer
definately
one
of
the
best
to
date
pouring
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a

its
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
it
gives
off
a
wonderful
very
bright
aroma
of
fresh
pine
that
promise
of
pine
certainly
lives
up
when
tasting
it
for
the
first
timeresiny
hops
fill
the
palate
but
it
subsides
into
a
malty
caramel
finish
with
a
deeply
satisfying
alcohol
undercurrent
its
a
wellbodied
beer
thats
neither
too
light
nor
too
heavy
it
may
not
be
entirely
sessionableit
can
be
a
bit
intensebut
its
certainly
a
rather
enjoyable
experience

this
is
quite
good
heres
to
another
20
years
from
one
of
americas
best
small
breweries
worth
checking
out
prefer
the
hopus
to
this
this
is
one
intriguing
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
dangerously
so
alcohol
does
not
make
an
appearance
in
either
taste
or
arom
but
the
head
feels
a
bit
twisted
after
a
few
and
then
you
realise
how
dangerous
this
beer
really
is
absolutely
loved
it
drinkability
is
good
on
its
own
but
this
really
should
be
paired
with
some
good
spicy
food
d
i
kind
of
like
it
im
not
a
huge
belgian
ipa
fan
but
the
beer
works
well
for
the
most
part
the
orange
flavor
is
a
bit
weird
but
its
not
a
dealbreaker
might
have
again
i
would
keep
drinking
and
drinking
and
drinking
this
lovely
the
high
abv
doesnt
bother
at
all
like
in
some
its
wonderful
raging
bitch
belgianstyle
ipa
is
flying
dogs
second
best
beer
horn
dog
barley
wine
style
ale
is
the
best
its
a
humdinger
of
an
ale
that
is
a
few
tweaks
away
from
being
amazing
heres
hoping
this
20th
anniversary
brew
becomes
a
yearround
release
d
really
nice
so
drinkable
i
would
definately
drink
this
again
this
is
probably
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
to
date
overall
raging
bitch
is
a
good
attempt
to
reproduce
a
belgian
take
on
an
american
style
i
have
to
admit
that
flying
dog
has
never
impressed
me
until
now
its
not
a
true
blue
belgian
ipa
but
its
hoppy
and
tasty
so
i
have
no
room
to
complain
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
one
that
is
certainly
worth
trying
most
days
i
would
prefer
a
sn
torpedo
but
this
is
enjoyable
for
a
unique
twist
pours
a
pretty
golden
orange
with
a
finger
plus
of
head
terrific
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
jump
out
of
the
nose
smells
like
one
of
the
really
good
ipas
lots
of
fruit
just
a
hint
of
the
yeast
coming
through
which
makes
this
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
the
hops
are
fresh
and
vibrant
some
caramel
sweetness
hints
of
esters
medium
bitterness
slick
mouthfeel
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
which
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
as
i
dont
particularly
enjoy
belgian
ipas
nor
have
i
been
overly
impressed
with
flying
dogs
offerings
outside
of
gonzo
would
gladly
drink
again
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
esters
that
dominated
the
flavour
remove
that
weird
astringency
and
this
could
be
a
worldclass
belgian
ipa
comments
a
beer
of
the
month
selection
that
i
received
in
special
limited
edition
750ml
bottles
this
beer
emphasizes
its
ipa
qualities
much
more
than
the
belgian
qualities
and
that
is
its
stylistic
shortcoming
for
me
d
this
was
a
very
nice
clean
and
crisp
belgian
ipa
it
had
a
nice
balance
of
bitter
and
sour
elements
with
some
sweet
malt
to
smooth
out
the
finish
it
had
good
body
and
was
easy
to
drink
among
the
best
flying
dog
beers
and
definitely
worth
a
try
aquired
taste
a
disappointing
beer
the
yeast
and
hops
are
not
integrated
well
and
the
bitterness
is
just
a
bit
too
high
what
a
wierd
beer
i
like
it
but
im
still
not
sure
what
to
think
of
it
will
revisit
at
a
later
date
md
the
bitter
end
is
a
little
offputting
but
the
beer
has
nice
carbonation
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
it
is
an
intense
beer
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
but
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
night
two
max
although
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
beer
initially
the
2nd
bottle
wasnt
as
bad
the
aftertase
is
a
real
negative
very
hoppy
though
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
one
again
good
drinkability
one
of
the
more
bitter
belgian
style
ipas
out
there
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
expected
hybrid
styles
not
usually
my
thing
but
the
belgian
yeast
is
toned
down
well
enough
to
meld
well
with
the
ipa
style
while
sustaining
its
uniqueness
this
is
a
cool
beer
its
highly
carbonated
like
a
belgian
but
very
americanized
with
the
hops
used
for
the
beginner
beer
drinker
this
would
be
the
beer
that
makes
you
want
to
try
them
all
poured
a
clearish
brown
with
a
slowly
dieing
frothy
head
and
a
light
airy
hoppy
smell
with
hints
of
citric
fruit
and
some
sweet
malt
a
easy
to
drink
ale
as
this
beer
is
lighttomedium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
good
hoppy
presence
that
makes
itself
known
with
sour
fruit
and
spiciness
some
yeasty
and
caramel
malt
mix
in
there
for
a
good
balance
not
the
tastiest
beer
yet
one
i
cant
help
but
keep
drinking
and
has
a
wellhidden
abv
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
one
of
my
first
belgian
ipas
and
id
say
a
good
introduction
into
the
style
easily
quaffable
for
the
alcohol
content
has
an
odd
sensation
of
flavorstaste
due
to
the
style
but
it
is
something
that
sort
of
grows
on
you
i
was
expecting
this
one
to
be
interesting
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
the
label
is
crazy
enough
but
the
flavor
backs
it
up
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
i
recommend
it
it
has
a
good
balance
between
the
hop
flavor
and
its
maltiness
can
get
a
little
overwhelming
at
times
but
a
nice
brew
nonetheless
oh
well
even
trying
to
get
away
from
getting
this
beer
an
identity
i
dont
think
ill
be
getting
it
again
just
a
bit
too
spicy
for
my
taste
d
the
alcohol
is
no
where
to
be
found
in
this
beer
raging
bitch
contradicts
itself
in
a
good
way
once
again
with
a
bark
thats
worse
than
bite
in
the
abv
regard
despite
the
nuances
of
this
brew
its
got
a
nice
clean
crisp
feel
and
east
of
drinkability
a
good
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
in
fact
from
flying
dog
drinkability
great
flavor
surprised
me
quite
a
bit
smooth
and
consistent
d
drinkable
with
nice
spicy
citrus
flavors
and
a
strikingly
authentic
belgian
yeast
character
d
a
bit
too
intense
of
an
aftertaste
to
score
mad
points
on
drinkability
but
after
a
few
of
these
i
might
not
notice
anyway
notes
this
one
is
just
plain
tasty
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
tried
from
flying
dog
and
i
must
admit
im
turned
off
a
bit
however
the
ralph
steadman
artwork
on
their
bottles
is
cool
enough
to
make
me
willing
to
give
some
of
their
other
beers
a
chance
overall
a
solid
stab
at
the
style
a
bit
too
dry
and
spiced
for
my
taste
one
is
enough
for
me
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
the
aftertaste
does
not
linger
and
the
filmy
sensation
i
mention
above
doesnt
hang
around
either
not
a
guzzling
beer
but
throwing
back
a
three
or
four
would
not
be
out
of
the
question
this
is
cripplingly
drinkable
flying
dogs
finest
moment
by
far
and
one
of
the
best
bargains
in
beerdom
while
it
lasts
for
being
an
american
version
of
this
style
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
overall
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
just
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
notes
sad
that
this
is
not
going
to
be
a
year
round
beer
for
flying
dog
seeing
as
it
the
beer
i
have
enjoyed
the
most
from
them
d
a
interesting
take
on
the
ipa
style
from
a
belgian
perspective
i
havent
had
a
belgian
ipa
before
but
this
is
exactly
what
i
would
imagine
it
to
taste
like
a
fruity
ipa
taken
to
the
extreme
with
that
characteristic
belgian
yeast
nose
and
flavor
id
definitely
have
this
again
but
its
pretty
middle
of
the
road
for
me
for
the
most
part
d
this
beer
would
have
been
rated
higher
if
the
flavors
would
have
combined
a
little
more
this
was
a
solid
beer
that
had
the
potential
of
being
awesome
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
flying
dog
well
done
d
i
was
certain
that
i
would
not
care
for
this
one
due
to
the
whole
belgain
ipa
thing
but
i
was
wrong
this
is
a
very
solid
and
easy
to
drink
brew
id
pick
up
more
of
this
one
if
i
could
find
it
recommended
for
sure
drinkability
is
good
one
could
easily
enjoy
several
glasses
of
this
concoction
feel
the
rage
ysee
in
public
speaking
courses
they
stress
attentiongetters
thats
the
best
i
could
come
up
with
here
speaking
of
attentiongetters
that
theres
a
transition
this
brews
got
quite
a
lovely
orangeamber
hue
to
it
capped
off
with
a
chapeau
of
white
suds
the
nose
comes
off
as
sugardipped
hops
steeped
in
some
funky
straw
and
garnished
with
some
parsley
not
only
does
it
add
a
bit
of
color
but
a
dash
of
spicy
aromatics
as
well
adding
to
the
whole
dining
experience
the
parsley
is
also
on
the
tongue
joined
by
some
mightily
bitter
hops
some
light
caramel
a
dash
of
soap
and
i
think
ive
got
a
pinch
of
paprika
in
there
too
something
like
that
so
and
here
im
connecting
with
the
audience
if
youre
lookin
for
a
tasty
light
and
nottoofizzy
beer
that
wont
leave
you
hanging
choose
raging
bitch
theres
an
overly
large
smile
on
my
face
at
this
point
i
think
i
may
have
stepped
into
commercial
territory
there
seriously
though
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
right
here
i
somehow
got
an
a
in
com
114
first
of
all
i
love
this
breweries
labels
definately
original
and
i
love
dogs
so
thats
a
big
plus
with
meanyhow
it
pours
a
deep
golden
hue
almost
bordering
on
copper
with
lovely
carbonation
that
leaves
a
creamy
two
finger
head
that
slowly
reduces
to
layer
of
froth
and
heaps
of
sticky
lacing
everywhereit
has
aromas
of
spicy
belgian
yeastpears
and
pepperoniit
has
a
nice
above
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
which
feels
quite
creamy
with
tastes
of
pearsapplespaw
pawboiled
candy
and
spicy
belgian
yeastoverall
this
is
definately
a
very
decent
brew
that
i
would
revisit
and
am
only
annoyed
at
the
fact
that
i
only
got
the
one
but
will
buy
more
of
tommorrow
without
doubt
overall
an
excellent
brew
and
one
of
the
best
of
these
belgian
ipas
that
ive
had
highly
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
sticky
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
i
could
down
a
couple
of
these
with
a
burger
and
fries
no
problem
however
im
not
sure
it
really
separates
itself
from
the
pack
enough
to
warrant
revisiting
drinkability
on
this
bitch
is
above
average
could
be
a
bit
higher
but
the
alcohol
content
will
sneak
up
on
you
and
bite
your
ass
consume
copious
amounts
of
water
during
or
after
having
a
few
of
these
as
you
might
wake
up
with
a
raging
bitch
of
a
headache
pours
a
lovely
orange
into
my
duvel
tulip
with
a
large
white
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lace
nose
is
a
nice
mixture
of
sweet
malts
belgian
spicy
yeast
and
floral
hop
notes
taste
doesnt
quite
match
the
sweet
malts
and
yeast
flavors
are
there
but
the
brewers
could
stand
to
ease
up
on
the
bittering
hops
and
ramp
up
the
late
additions
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
pretty
drinkable
as
well
not
in
any
way
hot
or
boozy
ive
learned
that
not
every
beer
is
for
everyone
and
thats
okay
i
like
this
beer
and
while
i
wont
go
crazy
over
stocking
my
fridge
with
any
collection
of
bitter
options
i
will
say
that
this
is
one
that
i
would
be
glad
to
have
around
dhugely
drinkable
i
have
had
a
number
of
very
good
brews
lately
but
the
profile
of
this
really
brings
a
smile
to
my
face
what
a
sweetheart
of
a
beer
after
a
few
sips
i
though
i
couldnt
imagine
a
better
beverage
this
was
packed
with
flavor
complex
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
was
only
my
first
belgian
ipa
i
will
certainly
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
of
the
same
a
really
decent
big
apa
that
is
too
drinkable
drinkability
if
you
dont
get
caught
up
in
the
belgian
aspect
which
im
not
this
is
a
damn
good
fruity
balanced
hoppy
dipa
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
more
of
these
one
of
the
best
flying
dogs
ive
had
a
tweaked
bolder
more
alcohol
more
belgian
version
i
could
see
phenomenal
as
a
corked
and
caged
future
part
of
their
series
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
while
the
smell
is
beautiful
and
enticing
and
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
not
overwhelmingly
bitter
it
is
not
quite
as
boundarypushing
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
that
and
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
is
pretty
high
on
this
one
means
that
it
is
easy
to
polish
off
a
pint
but
impossible
to
drink
a
sixer
i
wouldnt
invest
in
a
case
but
i
might
drink
it
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
d
love
this
one
great
ipa
with
some
kickers
unique
and
refreshing
wish
i
had
more
im
sold
decent
drinkability
well
made
beer
and
an
unusual
style
overall
this
is
my
first
beer
from
flying
dog
and
i
am
very
impressed
i
dont
know
if
they
went
all
out
on
this
one
since
its
their
20th
anniversary
beer
but
this
recipe
is
definitely
a
keeper
rich
ipa
flavor
mixed
with
beautiful
belgian
notes
if
this
beer
was
readily
available
in
my
area
it
would
have
a
permanent
place
in
my
fridge
damn
new
hampshire
for
banning
this
based
on
the
vulgar
name
definitely
pick
this
one
up
if
you
can
get
it
all
in
all
this
is
one
awesome
beer
the
first
belgian
ipa
ive
had
but
it
wont
be
the
last
12oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
coppery
color
very
clear
no
haze
which
is
a
bit
unexpected
1
of
offwhite
head
in
the
aroma
there
is
a
strong
hint
of
clovey
belgian
yeast
followed
up
closely
by
hop
bitterness
that
creeps
out
same
thing
in
the
palate
except
a
little
less
belgian
yeast
clovespice
character
more
hop
bitterness
that
makes
you
pucker
up
i
love
it
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
traditional
belgianstyle
ale
a
tad
thick
yet
soft
carbonation
very
dry
finish
the
mix
between
the
high
level
of
hops
belgian
character
is
wonderful
very
different
this
is
a
wonderful
ale
i
cannot
wait
to
get
more
d
a
nice
american
brewed
belgain
ipa
worth
trying
and
id
buy
again
shame
its
pretty
pricey
here
at
aus11
50
per
bottle
pretty
darn
tasty
though
8
oz
s
is
probably
more
than
enough
for
me
ultra
clear
light
golden
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
lacing
the
glass
i
really
like
the
smell
light
molasses
on
top
off
a
broad
but
light
tropical
fruitlike
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
good
too
i
get
an
increased
hop
presence
a
sweeter
grapefruit
base
and
underlying
malt
that
is
excellent
sharp
bitter
and
spicy
finish
a
bit
carbonated
the
alcohol
percentage
is
about
right
as
i
detect
but
a
small
amount
of
burn
on
the
end
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
one
of
these
every
once
in
a
while
belgian
due
to
the
yeast
but
really
this
is
a
solid
ipa
recommended
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
little
on
the
carbonated
side
but
still
a
delicious
brew
watch
out
for
the
abv
ive
had
raging
bitch
on
tap
and
from
the
bottle
it
was
definitely
better
fresh
on
tap
the
hops
go
a
long
way
to
temper
the
sickening
sweetness
that
made
the
bottled
version
a
disappointment
to
me
however
alltold
both
versions
suffer
from
being
too
obviously
a
fusion
where
the
whole
is
not
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
if
i
felt
like
an
ipa
id
order
a
better
one
than
this
so
too
if
i
wanted
a
belgian
ale
nothing
about
raging
bitch
draws
me
back
though
its
a
decent
beer
when
fresh
d
for
a
raging
bitch
abv
of
8
3
this
has
a
smoothness
you
can
appreciate
throughout
though
im
sure
the
well
hidden
alcohol
can
eventually
bite
you
in
the
arse
this
raging
bitch
is
actually
a
fine
and
sophisticated
lady
i
poured
this
bitch
into
a
12oz
goblet
id
put
in
the
freezer
for
about
15
minutes
dark
honeyamber
color
beautiful
head
and
fine
detailed
lacing
the
flavors
are
incredibly
well
balanced
and
rich
enough
to
hide
the
sturdy
abv
vanilla
oak
honey
minty
hops
with
a
creamy
silky
finish
and
a
slowly
fading
rich
welcoming
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
a
few
weeks
not
sure
about
the
belgian
appellation
here
since
it
doesnt
seem
akin
to
any
belgian
beer
ive
had
a
regular
ipa
title
would
be
fine
the
day
before
i
had
this
i
was
downing
some
bells
two
hearted
ale
and
this
is
clearly
better
even
though
the
bells
is
a
renowned
powerhouse
in
the
heavyduty
ipa
category
enjoy
and
please
my
friends
drink
responsibly
at
8
3
abv
drinkability
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
of
the
regular
flying
dog
lineup
though
it
doesnt
really
have
a
classic
belgian
ipa
character
not
crazy
about
the
finish
however
this
is
a
really
good
beer
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
flying
dog
and
much
better
than
expected
definitely
get
out
and
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
all
this
makes
for
a
robust
good
tasting
experience
did
i
mention
the
near
perfect
appearance
i
would
not
have
expected
a
lesser
brew
from
flying
dog
with
their
reputation
the
pressure
is
always
on
to
produce
great
product
my
first
try
at
a
belgain
style
india
pale
alewas
pleasantly
surprisedit
is

taste
very
simalar
to
some

india
pale
ales
the

5
alcohol
was
a
plus
for
me
also
not
exactly
my
favorite
but
definately
drinkable
and
not
like
anything
else
ihave
ever
had
with
belgian
in
the
name
also
pretty
creative
name
from
flying
dog
full
bodied
ipa
decent
mouth
feel
not
heavy
but
with
clarity
of
purpose
hint
of
spice
without
being
over
the
top
minor
bitter
in
the
after
taste
excellent
with
a
mild
cheese
nonsmoked
not
for
the
session
as
abv
is
high
enjoyable
worth
a
try
for
those
that
want
to
move
beyond
yellow
water
advertised
as
beer
i
had
this
a
few
months
ago
and
did
not
care
for
it
but
this
certainly
surprised
me
tonight
a
interesting
ipa
with
qualities
of
the
style
from
two
countries
perspectives
without
either
stepping
on
toes
it
packs
a
lil
punch
to
so
ill
stop
at
two
one
of
the
better
flying
dog
beers
ive
had
recently
happy
20th
guys
d
since
it
is
limited
i
may
grab
one
more
before
its
gone
but
i
did
like
it
and
the
price
was
very
affordable
very
solid
brew
pours
a
nice
shade
of
dark
orange
2finger
rocky
white
head
shrinks
but
covers
the
beer
the
whole
time
retains
quite
well
and
leaves
some
raging
lacing
definitely
smells
the
part
of
an
ipa
definitely
getting
the
citrus
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
alongside
with
scents
more
common
in
light
belgians
such
as
pear
and
yeast
a
strange
yet
intriguing
taste
it
seems
like
each
sip
varies
back
and
forth
between
styles
sometimes
it
is
ipa
sometimes
it
is
pale
belgian
but
these
dont
seem
to
mix
like
they
should
not
very
well
balanced
also
much
more
ipa
flavors
are
detectable
as
a
whole
rather
than
belgian
still
the
flavors
that
come
through
from
are
both
good
heavy
citrus
and
pine
slight
caramel
the
belgian
tastes
seem
to
focus
on
mostly
sugary
yeast
and
spice
a
bit
of
booze
mouthfeel
is
fine
carbonation
and
thickness
is
in
a
good
place
this
was
my
first
of
the
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
though
i
think
it
is
unbalanced
it
is
much
more
ipa
than
belgian
d
i
really
like
this
call
it
an
ipa
and
i
give
it
an
a
i
just
couldnt
taste
the
belgian
qualities
like
i
hoped
i
would
if
i
see
this
again
a
wonderfully
thick

great

this
is
a
powerful
beer
that
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
in

and
that
classic
belgian

smell
as
well
as
a
hint
of
piny

lots
going
on
on
the
nose
taste
is
more
ipa
pronounced
up
front
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
the
belgian
yeast
i
find
it
to
be
perhaps
a
little
too
intense
on
the
palate

insane
one
of
those
beers
like
nugget

that
will
disappear
on
you
extremely
easy
going
hoppy
spicy
brew
that
will
keep
you
wanting
more
and
more
once
you
try
it
out
i
used
to
love
frederick
brewing
company
when
wild
goose
beers
were
widely
available
to
me
and
their
average
offering
is
typically
a
quality
one
but
here
they
have
outdone
themselves
i
dont
know
if
the
controversy
with
the
name
and
design
of
this
brew
is
relevant
but
it
remains
a
great
and
very
welcome
offering
in
any
case

great
combination

ipa
a
winner
o
an
interesting
but
good
beer
well
balanced
and
different
from
the
norms
i
cant
remember
ever
trying
a
belgian
ipa
before
but
i
can
say
that
this
beer
doesnt
fit
any
other
category
i
have
tried
overall
very
good
beer
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
its
a
borderline
dipa
depending
on
your
palates
might
have
to
grab
more
for
some
sunday
football
grab
a
glass
and
hope
you
all
enjoy
salud
pours
a
big
frothy
white
head
atop
a
golden
body
with
some
haze
the
saison
yeast
provides
some
spice
while
papery
hops
give
grassy
citrus
flavors
of
clean
wheat
too
peppery
with
an
unbalancing
bitterness
the
hops
are
harsh
citrus
and
grass
leaving
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
of
steeped
vegetables
and
metal
high
carbonation
harsh
with
a
light
body
overall
an
interesting
tasting
beer
kind
of
like
a
belgian
ipa
mixed
with
a
saison
a
beer
that
i
wanted
to
try
but
not
something
that
id
rush
out
to
buy
more
of
the
forced
viral
video
marketing
for
this
beer
didnt
even
come
close
to
surpassing
the
true
persona
of
flying
dog
and
its
labeling
aggressive
but
drinkable
complex
but
still
approachable
for
most
beer
geeks
as
theyll
be
riding
off
the
hopping
this
makes
for
a
good
goto
beer
throughout
the
year
when
youre
looking
for
an
alternative
to
the
regular
rotation
of
pale
alesipas
it
sort
of
bridges
the
gap
between
a
saison
and
tripel
beer
is
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
esters
sour
banana
taste
is
sour
up
front
finishes
with
a
mild
wave
of
hops
followed
by
a
lot
of
spicy
notes
mouthfeel
is
ok
its
well
carbonated
and
light
on
the
palate
overall
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
the
beer
doesnt
do
too
much
for
me
it
is
sour
without
much
depth
or
any
interesting
notes
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
hybrid
saisonbelgian
ipa
style
and
found
it
quite
easy
to
drink
as
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
refreshing
overall
the
flavors
didnt
meld
nicely
for
me
with
the
tartness
the
most
disagreeable
element
it
has
an
interesting
character
though
i
dont
know
that
it
all
blends
in
together
to
make
this
an
excellent
brew
still
it
has
farmhouse
qualities
not
sure
about
the
ipa
part
though
it
is
relatively
hoppy
overall
not
great
but
decent
enough
i
prefer
the
raging
bitch
but
thats
just
my
opinion
o
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
but
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
saisony
ipa
with
some
decent
carbonation
and
sweetness
not
to
my
liking
but
i
believe
this
is
my
first
farmhouse
ipa
didnt
ralph
steadman
die
is
that
his
name
the
illustrator
that
guy
is
pretty
good
with
the
watercolors
ill
give
it
up
if
he
has
passed
away
his
estate
does
an
amazing
job
of
proliferating
his
artwork
oh
dang
maybe
it
was
just
hunter
thompson
who
passed
away
and
i
associate
the
two
of
them
closely
i
just
had
another
baltimore
beer
with
a
label
drawn
by
a
famous
artist
but
this
is
about
the
wildeman
which
was
pretty
good
the
hops
were
pretty
fresh
tasting
dadgum
bitter
and
a
little
bit
spicy
it
smelled
alright
looked
pretty
good
but
unfortunately
was
not
a
very
good
accompaniment
to
the
spicy
korean
style
noodles
i
was
eating
and
maybe
thats
my
own
fault
for
not
opting
to
drink
a
super
dry
something
or
other
and
ive
got
five
more
of
these
in
the
fridge
so
ill
be
sipping
again
under
different
circumstances
but
at
the
moment
am
inclined
to
say
solid
but
not
superlative
my
pour
created
a
massive
two
fingers
of
dense
french
vanillacolored
head
that
actually
resembled
the
top
of
an
ice
cream
cone
color
was
a
cloudy
lemonyellow
nose
had
both
a
citrusy
hoppiness
as
well
as
a
mustiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
interesting
hoppy
but
also
with
a
black
pepper
bite
plus
a
dry
mustiness
finish
was
quite
dry
between
the
spices
and
the
yeast
this
was
an
okay
beer
i
dont
really
dig
a
whole
lot
of
adjuncts
in
my
ipa
so
that
worked
against
this
one
sorry
overall
a
very
good
ipa
underrated
due
to
its
saisonlike
qualities
i
keep
telling
myself
i
wont
buy
any
more
belgian
ipas
then
i
buy
another
belgian
ipa
honestly
as
far
as
the
style
goes
this
isnt
that
bad
the
hop
profile
works
out
fairly
well
with
the
sweet
yeast
and
theres
a
lingering
hop
that
isnt
that
bad
at
all
i
still
dont
think
the
specific
combination
of
the
sweet
bananay
yeast
and
american
hops
works
out
though
ive
enjoyed
a
handful
of
belgian
ipas
but
theyve
all
strayed
away
from
the
overly
bananay
flavor
profile
if
you
actually
enjoy
belgian
ipas
you
might
like
this
its
obvious
that
the
style
has
done
great
for
flying
dog
since
this
is
their
second
belgian
ipa
to
get
bottled
but
much
like
raging
bitch
i
cant
recommend
it
smell
is
interesting
in
a
good
way
taste
is
interesting
in
a
bad
way
tastes
like
a
terrible
saison
mixed
with
a
even
worse
ipa
glad
i
only
took
one
bottle
from
my
brothers
fridge
he
has
not
even
tried
it
yet
i
hope
he
likes
it
more
then
me
i
hate
giving
bad
ratings
but
sometimes
you
just
gotta
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
medium
creamy
offwhite
head
massive
lacing
that
sticks
to
the
glass
like
glue
the
smell
is
of
of
fresh
apricots
and
a
hint
of
vinegar
taste
begins
with
some
apricot
followed
by
some
sweet
bread
then
some
honey
and
an
herbal
asprinlike
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
good
belgian
style
ipa
though
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
for
the
style
o
im
torn
here
it
seems
to
be
a
pretty
decent
belgian
pale
ale
but
doesnt
follow
through
on
the
promise
of
the
ipa
character
not
bad
though
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
citrus
hops
spices
taste
is
lots
of
spice
hops
citrus
some
malts
more
spice
a
lot
going
on
here
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
checking
out
overall
a
rather
pleasant
drinking
farmhouse
ipa
it
had
a
nice
blend
of
the
funk
and
hop
to
make
for
a
good
and
tasty
drinking
brew
pretty
good
tasting
though
i
would
need
time
to
aquire
a
taste
for
it
well
he
certainly
looks
pretty
wild
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
sunrise
gold
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
peel
light
grapefruit
zest
light
orange
peel
mild
flowers
light
dried
honey
and
a
vague
sense
of
bready
belgian
yeast
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
sharp
vein
of
grapefruit
peel
running
through
stabbing
the
tongue
from
time
to
time
but
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
most
of
the
time
anyway
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
dry
finish
overall
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
bipa
even
if
the
belgian
aspect
is
somewhat
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
good
times
o
overall
id
say
this
would
be
the
best
ipa
ive
had
and
my
first
belgian
ipa
i
nicely
brings
together
the
sweetness
of
most
belgian
ales
with
the
bitterness
of
ipas
being
that
its
half
what
i
like
and
half
what
i
like
and
half
what
i
dont
this
is
a
nice
synthesis
and
another
good
beer
from
flying
dog
i
recommend
this
beer
overall
a
solid
beer
interesting
flavor
that
i
found
slightly
intriguing
farmhouse
ipa
huh
well
it
works
good
balance
of
saisonlike
light
ale
elements
with
a
strong
but
restrained
hop
bitterness
the
two
pieces
fit
together
well
and
make
for
a
highly
drinkable
ale
with
a
refreshing
lighter
taste
in
the
package
of
the
heavier
body
and
potency
of
some
of
the
higher
abv
ipas
short
of
the
imperial
class
the
result
is
undeniably
worth
trying
for
fans
of
either
style
and
will
surely
appeal
to
many
in
both
camps

o
it
is
always
hit
miss
with
belgian
ipas
and
this
one
was
a
miss
not
poor
but
just
an
average
i
would
say
the
appearance
and
nose
saved
this
12oz

astringent

that
is

overall
nice
take
on
the
style
but
not
much
of
a
wow
factor
still
recommendable
though
o
very
good
but
i
couldve
sworn
that
this
exact
beer
already
exists
and
its
called
raging
bitch
luckily
for
flying
dog
im
not
docking
points
for
that
and
mislabeling
it
farmhouse
im
sure
they
care
overall
this
is
my
least
favorite
farmhouse
ale
that
ive
hadthe
floral
hops
dont
settle
well
with
the
higher
abv
in
this
brew
and
for
me
produces
a
flowery
antiseptic
taste
that
lingers
on
my
palette
its
too
bitter
for
a
belgian
and
not
hoppy
enough
for
an
ipathe
spices
are
a
bit
overdoneits
certainly
drinkable
but
nothing
that
is
overwhelming
or
something
i
would
get
again
25
look
is
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
head
smells
of
barnyard
lemon
coriander
clove
etc
taste
follows
with
pepper
clove
infused
wheat
small
blast
of
bubblegum
theres
a
slight
kick
of
herbal
hops
at
the
end
but
otherwise
its
very
unlike
an
ipa
how
have
i
not
reviewed
this
beer
already
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
the
past
year
let
me
start
by
saying
that
ipa
should
not
be
anywhere
near
the
name
of
this
beer
it
is
a
bottle
conditioned
belgian
style
ale
with
a
slight
touch
of
hops
at
the
end
it
pours
an
amazing
head
watch
out
it
will
foam
up
all
over
the
place
the
taste
is
complex
and
full
of
esters
if
you
swirl
the
last
bit
of
beer
in
the
bottle
it
will
produce
a
crazy
dr
seuss
like
foam
to
top
your
beer
off
with
the
flavors
go
in
every
direction
with
a
yeasty
sediment
cloud
lurking
right
below
the
head
an
amazing
american
version
of
a
belgian
farmhouse
beer
just
drop
the
ipa
from
the
name
please
what
a
fun
beer
nice
job
flying
dog
o
nice
big
hot
mess
of
flavors
some
interesting
some
a
bit
odd
but
none
of
them
are
really
offensive
perhaps
a
bit
shocking
but
pretty
tasty
all
the
same
o
overall
too
bitter
and
not
enough
hop
flavor
otherwise
good
flying
dog
continually
produces
beers
that
strike
me
as
quite
interesting
and
good
this
is
a
strong
example
of
a
belgian
style
beer
a
minimal
hop
influence
puts
some
spicy
tones
on
things
its
a
pleasant
and
easy
drinker
i
like
this
one
definitely
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
trying
it
again
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
super
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
citrus
zest
spices
and
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
smell
but
the
taste
is
not
as
good
in
my
opinion
overall
a
tasty
and
quaffable
belgian
ipa
i
like
it
i
would
have
loved
it
if
the
brewers
were
not
so
stingy
with
the
hops
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
perhaps
more
than
i
conveyed
above
it
is
balanced
tasty
and
just
appeals
to
my
palate
very
tasty
and
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
overall
very
light
drinkable
nothing
too
distinctive
no
dominant
flavors
overall
as
an
ipa
its
very
light
and
not
agressive
some
of
the
characteristics
of
wildeman
are
desirable
and
other
aspects
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
a
better
balance
in
the
flavor
could
make
this
one
a
memorable
experience
d
awesome
for
what
it
is
if
you
can
appreciate
something
thats
intentionally
off
balance
and
a
total
hop
bomb
then
this
is
a
brew
for
you
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
very
frothy
cream
colored
head
that
settled
after
a
bit
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
light
amber
with
plenty
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
slightly
on
the
mild
side
hop
lemon
other
citrus
and
fruit
and
a
little
earthy
yeast
flavors
like
nose
has
a
sharply
rising
bitterness
very
slight
sweet
and
somehow
a
perfectly
matching
carbonic
tang
body
is
full
and
has
lots
of
high
points
from
strong
bitterness
and
sharp
but
pleasant
carbonation
also
has
alcohol
warmth
almost
immediately
finish
is
like
flavor
with
lemon
and
sweetness
coming
out
a
bit
more
long
and
drinkable
poured
a
hazy
golden
with
white
head
it
looked
like
a
wheat
but
smelled
of
delicious
hops
it
had
a
definite
mediumheavier
body
with
solid
mouthfeel
it
tasted
strongly
of
bitter
hops
but
without
any
harsh
bitter
after
taste
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
that
id
consider
as
a
goto
session
ale
d
enjoyable
but
i
cant
imagine
sessioning
a
funky
beer
i
was
actually
disappointed
with
the
first
i
poured
seemed
to
be
infected
as
it
was
a
gusher
the
second
bottle
was
fine
though
o
a
very
good
beer
not
exactly
what
i
expected
but
tasty
o
not
the
first
belgian
ipa
ive
encountered
but
probably
the
first
one
that
utilizes
a
saison
yeast
definitely
imparts
the
farmhouse
aspect
as
advertised
along
with
a
very
americantype
bitterness
for
the
ipa
aspect
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
a
bitter
saison
or
funky
ipa
o
unique
but
a
really
weak
offering
that
i
wouldnt
go
to
again
if
i
wanted
a
belgian
ale
i
would
go
with
one
that
is
less
bitter
if
i
wanted
an
ipa
i
would
get
one
that
had
more
diverse
flavors
than
just
bitter
the
spices
are
overpowering
and
it
seems
more
like
a
bitter
version
of
a
belgian
ale
than
anything
else
overall
i
wasnt
overwhelmed
by
this
one
i
think
its
overcarbonated
not
memorable
or
one
i
would
have
again
i
would
like
more
from
the
hops
more
of
a
pale
ale
for
me
but
still
good
belgian
character
d
not
bad
the
aroma
is
more
promising
than
the
flavor
turns
out
to
be
there
is
a
lack
of
hop
character
in
the
flavor
despite
pine
and
grapefruit
notes
in
the
nose
and
the
clove
is
excessive
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
be
excited
to
have
again
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
pearlike
quality
that
slides
into
a
citrus
zing
and
ends
with
a
powerfully
floral
hopped
bitterness
that
makes
me
wince
with
its
pungency
at
first
but
then
lingers
to
a
fairly
nice
finale
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
liking
though
medium
body
excellent
drinking
slide
down
good
and
carefree
while
leaving
traces
of
bitterness
in
the
wake
you
get
the
feeling
of
a
saison
overcome
with
hops
and
damn
it
all
but
i
like
this
one
i
like
a
lot
o
this
is
a
descent
beer
in
its
own
unique
way
and
unlike
any
that
i
have
had
it
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
and
tends
to
make
you
thirstier
as
you
drink
it
if
you
like
funky
beers
and
ipas
you
should
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
cheers
d
an
interesting
brew
from
flying
dog
ive
enjoyed
their
recent
belgian
infused
offerings
unique
and
quite
tasty
not
something
i
would
drink
with
regularity
but
i
would
never
shy
away
from
either
a
nice
little
beer
pours
straw
gold
topped
with
a
pillowy
thick
bright
white
head
significant
splotching
lacing
as
the
head
recedes
and
the
brew
is
consumed
strong
aroma
of
farmhouse
yeast
and
mild
grassy
notes
on
the
nose
opens
with
funk
and
grass
fruit
perhaps
pear
and
apple
peel
midpalate
and
finishes
dry
with
some
notes
grapefruitrind
hop
bitterness
overall
a
successful
belgianamericanstyle
hybrid
an
overall
enjoyable
brew
easy
to
drink
a
nice
take
on
the
style
not
one
i
would
buy
again
but
worth
a
try
o
not
as
good
as
it
was
fresh
the
dry
hops
have
faded
in
the
bottled
version
but
still
a
wonderful
hybrid
beer
easily
one
of
my
fav
belgian
ipas
and
something
i
hope
to
see
more
from
so
cal
brewers
o
i
admit
im
partial
to
the
belgian
ipa
i
like
when
these
2
schools
come
together
this
is
a
very
good
beer
delicious
and
well
made
o
flying
dog
has
been
getting
better
and
better
lately
and
ive
been
enjoying
their
offerings
i
think
this
beer
falls
pray
to
appealing
to
the
masses
perhaps
an
introduction
to
the
style
but
is
lacking
for
those
already
familiar
with
it
drinkable
enjoyable
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
very
high
quality
offerings
available
elsewhere
o
funky
spicy
and
foamy
not
a
terrible
flavor
just
not
real
good
not
what
i
expected
from
an
ipa
ive
yet
to
meet
too
many
ipas
that
i
dont
like
belgian
style
or
otherwise
oanother
great
beer
from
flying
dog
it
strays
from
the
classic
farmhouse
taste
but
an
overall
delicious
ale
pretty
good
and
distinctly
belgian
in
nature
the
fruity
yeast
flavours
and
aromas
dominate
its
character
not
much
in
the
way
of
aromatic
hops
the
hints
of
citrus
are
light
and
easily
overpowered
though
stewed
hops
add
a
strident
bitterness
ultimately
it
comes
across
as
unbalanced
and
overly
yeasty
worth
trying
but
not
the
best
belgian
ipa
out
there
definitely
more
a
saison
than
a
belgian
ipa
citra
adds
an
interesting
finish
but
this
seems
to
put
ibus
over
aroma
in
making
this
an
ipa
like
other
fd
beers
which
adds
up
to
harshness
especially
on
the
astringent
finish
hard
work
in
de
wildeman
deserves
better
o
overall
funky
spicy
bright
hoppy
and
a
good
american
interpretation
solid
by
example
starts
off
with
a
wow
factor
and
holds
strong
til
the
end
of
the
experience
a
sixpack
worthy
buy
that
could
of
easily
been

although
a

taste
and
more

good
carb
not
too
bubly
like
some
saisons
light
on
the
tongue
but
nice
body
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
in
any
case
the
beer
was
well
crafted
however
not
he
one
that
would
ever
turn
me
on
to
the
farmhouse
style
a
worthy
attempt
though
throwing
truck
loads
of
hops
in
a
beer
doesnt
always
make
the
good
beer
having
said
that
i
would
buy
this

stuff
o
its
unfortunate
that
its
so
sweet
but
still
good
because
its
fairly
interesting
far
from
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
had
but
very
good
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
nose
the
coloring
was
gorgeous
with
a
solid
head
to
boot
the
nose
filled
with
a
cooling
and
inviting
aroma
this
was
however
a
bit
malt
heavy
for
the
style
and
surprisingly
very
much
like
a
witbier
these
vibes
also
poured
over
a
bit
too
much
into
taste
and
we
found
things
to
stray
a
little
too
far
from
the
stylistic
path
it
was
a
refreshing
beer
nonetheless
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
the
style
it
was
going
in
the
right
direction
but
this
beer
needed
much
more
balance
to
it
this
beer
didnt
have
the
greatest
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
smooth
and
the
flavors
have
a
hard
time
holding
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
aroma
they
were
both
pretty
damn
good
with
a
nice
complex
aroma
and
tons
of
great
head
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
lack
of
balance
less
overly
bitter
hops
and
more
farmhouse
flavors
could
makes
this
a
great
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
rather
have
a
raging
bitch
its
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
it
to
blow
your
mind
all
in
all
this
beer
was
solid
but
the
lack
of
balance
prevented
it
from
being
something
great
i
like
that
flying
dog
is
blurring
the
line
between
styles
but
i
think
it
could
have
been
executed
just
a
little
better
i
may
need
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
i
was
pretty
sure
this
beer
was
newly
released
and
it
just
showed
up
at
the
lager
mill
thats
why
i
am
surprised
to
see
it
was
a
week
away
from
being
out
of
date
i
dont
really
understand
that
i
was
really
digging
this
going
in
the
look
smell
were
pretty
admirable
but
that
steamroller
of
underbalanced
bitterness
dryness
were
too
much
for
me
to
really
enjoy
this
o
pretty
darn
good
farmhouse
ipa
a
little
bitter
and
dry
but
nice
stuff
overall
not
bad
i
was
kind
of
turned
off
at
first
but
it
definitely
grew
on
me
by
the
end
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
but
not
several
in
one
session
i
want
to
try
others
in
this
style
as
it
is
new
to
me
o
this
beer
was
a
nice
experiment
i
think
they
did
a
really
good
job
of
it
id
love
to
try
it
a
little
more
fresh
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
if
nothing
else
i
like
what
it
has
going
for
it
but
i
thought
it
could
use
a
little
bit
of
refining
by
perhaps
turning
the
bitterness
slightly
down
if
only
the
taste
matched
the
nuances
of
the
nose
more
id
enjoy
this
one
a
lot
more
than
this
do
i
never
thought
id
say
this
sarcasm
but
i
would
consider
this
this
flying
dog
offering
to
be
a
good
beginner
beer
for
its
style
that
said
its
not
bad
no
off
flavors
that
i
can
detect
just
doesnt
have
the
wow
factor
that
many
other
belgian
ipas
do
o
refreshing
and
clean
this
is
truly
a
great
summer
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
really
enjoyable
the
bitterness
is
pronounced
but
not
too
overpowering
this
is
a
great
mix
of
farmhouse
and
ipa
im
glad
i
grabbed
this
up
and
will
probably
purchase
more
soon

its
fairly
splotchy

all
that
the

is

there
are
some
bubble
gum
fruity
and
light

aromas
present
though
about
what
id
expect
for

the
flavor
is
a

more

shining
through
more
than
anything

there
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
some
citrus

present
as
well
as
a
brief
opening
of
crackerlike
maltiness
still
i
found
myself
checking
the
bottle
for
the
best
by
code
august
14th
because
of
the
relatively
tame
hop
presence
the
body
is
suitably
light
but
the
carbonation
is
a
little
too
dull
wildeman
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
its
just
a
little
light
on
the
hops
for
a
belgian
ipa
o
could
easily
just
label
this
a
saison
and
id
be
happy
nice
taste
id
get
it
again
bitter
and
astringent
from
start
to
finish
this
tastes
like
theres
very
little
belgium
inspiring
this
beer
this
is
maybe
a
hopheads
ipa
with
some
belgian
sensibility
not
that
thius
beer
is
bad
per
se
just
not
something
ill
buy
again
i
love
ipas
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
but
this
just
cuts
my
palate
in
the
wrong
way
dropped
my
overall
to
3
5
because
taste
matters
so
much
i
liked
this
and
i
think
this
is
a
solid
brew
from
these
folks
and
worth
trying
but
it
would
be
hard
to
have
more
than
one
o
belgian
ipas
are
swiftly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles

was

5
probably
below

0
definitely
overall
its
actually
not
a
bad
farmhouse
ale
of
the
classic
saison
variety
but
personally
i
think
theyve
somewhat
missed
the
mark
on
the
ipa
front
the
belgian
ipa
category
is
deceivingly
catchall
covering
superhoppy
bspas
many
of
which
are
excellent
tripeldipa
hybrids
hit
or
miss
but
can
be
huge
hits
white

hybrids
still
intriguing
still
not
sure
what
to
make
of
the
concept
and
saison
farmhouseipa
hybrids
love
the
idea
have
yet
to
see
one
knock
it
out
of
the
park
this
is
a
good
beer
no
doubt
about
it
and
id
drink
it
againbut
im
not
sure
it
helps
define
the
category
i
would
love
to
give
this
another
shot
though
especially
with
a
fresher
bottle
pale

color
with
a
massive
cap
of

awesome

farmhouse
yeast
funk
nose
grassy
wet

etc
the
taste
is
very
much
a
farmhousesaison
taste
dry
low
sweetness
high
funk
but
the
hops
add
some
fruity
notes
to
it
more
of
a
flavorful
farmhouse
ale
than
a
belgian
ipa
but
a
good
beer
overall
maybe
one
of
flying
dogs
finest
achievements
ive
had
yet
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
brews
from
flying
dog
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
olive
tree
market
in
san
diego
o
definitely
lives
up
to
the
farmhouse
part
of
its
name
i
feel
that
it
is
a
little
rough
around
but
that
is
what
i
like
about
this
beer
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
good
beer
cant
wait
to
find
a
nodcask
draft
version
overall
more
like
a
really
spicy
and
maybe
hoppy
saison
than
a
belgian
ipa
regardless
it
is
tasty
brew
overall
a
commendable
effort
from
flying
dog
nice
use
of
the
rye
to
help
intermarry
the
belgian
yeast
with
the
hoppy
ipa
character
alot
of
promise
but
falls
pretty
flat
in
the
taste
department
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
its
good
and
it
does
hide
the
abv
really
well
an
ok
beer
but
i
thing
raging
bitch
is
a
superior
beer
maybe
next
they
will
try
making
a
straightforward
saison
and
leave
the
extreme
out
of
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
huge
head
to
it
tons
of
bubbles
flowing
up
funky
yeasty
smell
taste
is
medium
bodied
pretty
good
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
flavor
nice
and
hoppy
with
some
great
spiciness
and
funkiness
somehow
still
manages
to
stay
pretty
balanced
and
drinkable
a
nice
variation
from
the
typical
ipa
the
belgian
yeasts
add
a
good
touch
of
flavor
while
the
hops
still
shine
through
solid
beer
o
good
stuff
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
decent
belgian
ipa
the
hops
are
bitter
enough
to
be
noticeable
and
fight
through
the
intense
yeasty
flavor
the
nose
is
contradictory
off
putting
and
pleasing
at
the
same
time
good
flavor
good
drinkability
its
worth
a
try
o
flying
dog
is
finally
starting
to
put
out
some
good
beers
i
havent
enjoyed
a
single
beer
from
them
until
they
put
out
kujo
which
was
freaking
fantastic
this
one
is
nice
and
a
cool
concept
but
its
nothing
all
that
special
i
look
forward
to
trying
flying
dog
brews
in
the
future
looks
like
theyre
finally
onto
something
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
id
say
its
more
of
a
saison
than
a
belgian
ipa
very
similar
to
sorachi
ace
but
not
quite
there
slightly
heavy
booze
taste
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
but
other
than
that
its
a
very
refreshing
beer
for
a
beautiful
night
like
tonight
o
really
well
done
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
love
the
mouthfeel
beautiful
looking
a
wonderful
floral
aroma
and
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
ill
definately
be
picking
up
more
of
this
overall
very
enjoyable
many
similarities
can
be
drawn
to
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
but
this
one
is
more
casually
drinkable
i
really
like
flying
dogs
brews
but
this
is
way
to
bitter
and
overcarbonated
for
my
liking
i
would
not
buy
it
again
in
contrast
to
their
red
sky
saison
which
i
really
like
very
nice
and
drinkable
beer
i
really
dig
it
this
has
more
saisonfarmhouse
qualities
than
ipa
qualities
its
a
nice
crisp
beer
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
crazy
over
raging
bitch
blows
this
out
of
the
water
imo
foggy
golden
yellow
a
big
chunky
head
rests
on
top
retaining
well
as
a
lumpy
covering
leaving
bits
of
lace
behind
sweet
yeasty
aroma
grassy
floral
hops
peppery
citrus
and
some
cakelike
malts
the
citrus
element
is
stronger
on
the
tongue
orange
grapefruit
and
lemon
bitterness
juicy
with
spicy
phenolics
and
more
green
floral
notes
i
want
more
smoothness
and
some
of
that
malt
to
come
through
but
this
is
solid
as
an
aggressively
hopped
saison
dry
medium
body
with
a
little
creaminess
decent
overall
but
im
glad
i
just
got
the
single
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
earthy
and
a
bit
sweet
with
notes
of
dry
hops
in
the
taste
a
sweet
earthiness
to
dry
yeasty
presence
with
some
orange
citrus
hops
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
yeast
and
small
orange
citrus
hops
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
yeast
presence
and
pleasant
orange
citrus
hops
to
balance
it
out
overall
i
wish
the
focus
had
been
more
on
flavoring
than
bittering
hops
they
dominate
the
interesting
farmhouse
and
belgian
yeast
esters
whats
wonderful
about
saisons
are
that
they
are
the
driest
fruitiest
and
spiciest
of
all
the
belgian
styles
it
makes
sense
for
this
base
beer
to
bear
the
brunt
of
american
hops
in
the
growing
belgianstyle
ipas
as
american
hoppy
ales
do
much
the
same
i
think
flying
dog
is
on
the
right
track
but
i
would
like
to
see
more
belgain
character
and
a
balance
that
doesnt
favor
the
spice
and
harsh
bitterness
quite
so
much
overall
eh
not
really
bad
for
the
style
think
i
am
just
burned
out
on
it
d
this
had
a
nicely
balanced
scent
and
taste
with
good
body
no
noticeable
alcohol
and
fairly
smooth
finish
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
nice
crisp
beer
although
nothing
too
special
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
nice
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
yeasty
spice
and
notes
of
floral
hops
definitely
drinks
more
like
a
saison
than
an
ipa
the
hops
being
subdued
by
the
huge
spice
profile
which
is
right
up
in
your
face
as
well
as
the
alcohol
which
seemed
unusually
hot
for
a
lighter
beer
lightmedium
body
and
fairly
drinkable
but
really
offbalanced
probably
needs
either
a
tweaking
of
the
recipe
or
more
likely
a
little
more
time
to
mellow
out
o
the
dryness
of
this
beer
makes
it
quite
refreshing
it
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
saison
and
a
belgian
ipa
the
alcohol
is
also
well
hidden
from
the
taste
soft
lightly
toasted
malts
up
front
mix
of
citrus
tropical
fruit
and
bitterness
come
on
strong
orange
marmalade
lemon
pine
and
grapefruit
all
come
through
along
with
a
little
pineapple
and
juicy
malt
big
bitterness
takes
over
near
the
finish
but
the
fruity
citrusy
flavors
stay
there
dry
earthy
funky
musty
finish
mediumbodied
with
a
creamy
feel
very
appetizing
and
delicious
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
straw
color
which
is
clear
with
tons
of
carbonation
from
the
belgian
yeast
that
makes
up
most
of
the
beers
profile
yeast
is
in
the
forefront
of
the
aroma
profile
with
hops
rounding
it
out
with
a
nice
citrus
and
piney
edge
the
flavor
is
yeast
as
well
with
hops
coming
through
as
mostly
bitterness
more
than
flavor
which
i
find
is
common
in
farmhousebelgian
ipa
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
overall
a
great
addition
to
the
flying
dog
arsenal
of
beers
that
always
bring
an
original
feel
to
a
style
of
beer
that
a
lot
of
breweries
are
putting
out
good
stuff
pale
yellow
in
color
with
an
orange
hue
through
the
middle
and
a
deep
haze
poured
with
a
huge
white
foam
that
almost
over
topped
the
glass
excellent
head
retention
belgian
yeast
banana
and
spice

up

with
grapefruit
and
citrus
hop
aromas
in
the
background
creamy
feel
despite
the
assertive
carbonation
yeasty
and
sweet
banana
flavors
up
front
that
transition
to
citrus
grapefruit
and
pineapple
hops
thru
the
middle
and
pine
flavors
toward
the
end
a
light
biscuity
backbone
beneath
and
a
spicy
peppery
flavor
that
rides
overtop
from
start
to
end
where
it
intensifies
finishes
with
a
spicy
pine
hop
aftertaste
nice
flavor
complexity
oraging
bitch
was
great
this
isnt
it
is
suppose
to
be
a
belgian
ipa
but
i
didnt
get
any
ipahop
notes
like
raging
bitch
but
with
a
more
saison
style
not
bad
but
i
think
i
prefer
raging
bitch
this
is
a
solid
belgian
ipa
even
if
it
is
a
tiny
bit
on
the
harsh
side
flavorful
tropical
fruit
from
the
hops
with
all
the
spiciness
from
the
belgian
influence
solid
on
all
fronts
this
beer
was
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
and
easy
to
drink
it
hides
the
abv
very
well
and
could
be
a
session
beer
at
a
summer
party
or
barbeque
for
me
definitely
worth
trying
cheers
o
a
nice
complement
to
the
flying
dog
lineup
raging
bitch
is
forever
one
of
my
gotos
but
this
nearly
holds
its
own
overall
a
kind
of
funky
beer
not
tart
just
musty
and
bitter
not
bad
for
a
belgian
ipa
certainly
drinkable
id
compare
this
to
ommegangs
bpa
but
with
a
stronger
tendency
towards
pineapple
and
a
little
bit
more
of
a
kick
to
it
overall
a
decently
strong
offering
by
flying
dog
and
one
that
im
glad
i
tried
this
poured
out
as
a
lightly
hazed
looking
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
full
of
belgian
farmhouse
aromas
not
funky
just
grainy
and
earthy
the
hop
aromas
were
a
little
muted
i
thought
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
lot
like
a
regular
saisonfarmhouse
ale
also
not
much
of
a
hop
kick
to
it
the
mouthfeel
had
a
sharp
carbonation
to
it
with
a
lighter
body
overall
this
beer
was
good
but
i
think
that
the
hops
could
have
been
a
little
more
pronounced
in
the
nose
and
taste
an
all
around
good
belgian
ipa
very
good
blends
of
flavors
here
great
brew
here
from
flying
dog
a
great
summer
brew
or
anytime
brew
really
i
like
the
masked
abv
as
well
good
stuff
good
worth
grabbing
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
clear
light
to
medium
golden
with
a
large
blooming
white
head
that
stuck
nicely
to
the
glass
leaving
multiple
rings
of
lace
as
it
settled
slowly
into
a
frothy
mass

of
tropical

yeasty
phenols
underneath

slightly

citric
hops
on
the
palate
but
they
seem
to
lose
some
punch
pretty
quicklyspiced
yeasy
phenols
play
a
small
role
the
flavors
lack
some
depth
and
complexity
but
this
is
a

similar
to
the
same
yeast
they
use
in

and
a
bit
funky
flavor
wise
this
hits
with
big
time
bitterness
from
both

additions
spicy
yeast
notes
black
pepper
qualities
and
something
i
cant
pin
my
finger
on
the
artwork
and
the
beer
are
pretty
crazy
i
like
how
the
new
sixpack
holders
proudly
state
that
this
stuff
is
being
brewed
in
frederick
md
something
us
beergeeks
have
been
in
tune
with
since
they
left
denver
years
ago
serve
it
a
bit
cold
it
masks
some
of
the
bitterness
that
i
found
kind
of
offensive
in
my
first
couple
sips
fade
a
bit
the
yeast
is
bitter
the
hops
are
bitter
and
there
seems
to
be
citrus
pith
that
is
bitter
with
minimal
sweetness
masked
by
the
belgian
yeast
strain
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
cluster
mouthfeel
is
cloyingly
dry
and
bitter
with
layers
of
hops
spice
alcohol
citrus
peel
just
downright
awful
texture
starts
to
make
me
want
to
gag
also
you
have
to
deal
with
the
high
level
of
carbonation
im
pawning
the
rest
of
these
beers
off
on
my
cousin
joe
who
pretty
much
loves
any
beer
from
flying
dog
overall
i
will
not
revisit
or
waste
my
time
on
such
a
harsh
beer
drinking
experience
i
like
belgianssaisons
ipas
white
ales
but
not
when
theyre
all
blended
together
fans
of
raging
bitch
will
love
this
similar
enough
yet
different
in
its
own
way
a
bit
too
tart
for
me
but
it
was
interesting
to
see
how
well
the
saison
and
ipa
flavors
worked
together
im
very
happy
with
this
mixandmatch
selection
would
snag
a
sixer
no

a
worthy

o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
a
very
nice
belgium
ipa
and
i
am
kind
of
glad
its
hoppy
since
it
makes
it
tasty
others
drink
like
a
belgium
pale
ale
o
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
different
than
what
id
normally
drink
but
a
nice
take
on
this
up
and
coming
style
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
has
a
good
hop
presence
with
the
citrusclove
profile
of
a
saison
that
keep
it
very
light
and
drinkable
very
refreshing
and
perfect
for
the
hotter
months
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
ipa
but
im
really
a
sucker
for
a
good
farmhouse
saison
this
was
about
as
good
as
it
could
have
been
to
my
mind
paid
about
1
80
for
the
bottle
i
love
this
beer
for
the
price
point
and
for
loving
flying
dog
but
i
wish
the
head
wasnt
so
extreme
and
the
appearance
had
more
power
the
taste
is
perfect
and
is
great
proof
of
a
reclassification
of
imperial
saisons
or
something
along
those
lines
the
taste
comes
off
as
strong
piney
flavor
at
first
with
subtle
belgian
yeast
which
gives
a
light
spice
and
it
is
slightly
obscured
by
the
hops
which
have
some
mild
citrus
tinges
and
the
yeast
adds
a
light
funkiness
to
the
middle
which
could
almost
be
mistaken
for
brett
with
light
barnyard
character
the
flavor
recedes
into
a
bitter
and
dry
finish
which
is
actually
refreshing
given
the
carbonation
overall
i
like
this
in
comparison
to
some
other
american
belgian
style
ipas
it
is
very
tasty
with
emphasis
on
hops
and
nice
yeast
augmentation
this
was
certainly
an
interesting
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
with
that
crisp
juiciness
of
the
hops
and
easy
feeling
body
wanting
this
to
go
down
quickly
yet
that
bold
spiciness
from
the
yeast
makes
you
hold
back
some
i
guess
in
the
end
i
could
have
used
a
bit
less
spice
here
but
i
didnt
let
it
ruin
my
experience
with
this
beer
as
its
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
different
beast
than
the
raging
bitch
and
i
liked
it
love
the
style
and
im
impressed
with
this
new
one
from
flying
dog
similar
to
what
a
raging
bitch
is
for
an
ipa
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
lively
level
of
carbonation
that
full
7
5
alcohol
is
felt
and
really
exaggerated
by
the
dryness
of
this
brew
and
the
herbal
hops
the
whole
idea
here
of
a
saisonipa
hybrid
was
well
executed
whereas
the
aroma
is
very
saison
forward
it
is
much
more
balanced
between
the
2
in
the
flavor
department
if
the
alcohol
was
tamed
down
a
bit
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
bunch
of
this
quite
effortlessly
however
asis
with
its
dryness
and
alcohol
punch
i
am
only
good
for
a
glass
or
2
at
a
time
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
disclaimer
tasted
from
6
ounce
tasting
glass
the
ale
still
poured
with
a
1cm
head
and
showed
thin
lacing
on
the
glass
body
is
medium
with
just
a
slight
chewiness
and
a
moderate
amount
of
bitterness
to
the
finish
dry
and
spicy
well
done
ill
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
this
and
raging
bitch
o
great
smelling
beer
with
an
pretty
well
executed
mix
of
hefeweizen
spiciness
and
ipa
bitterness
only
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
flavors
interesting
beer
to
try
but
probably
not
my
favorite
of
styles
notes
sure
enough
it
reminds
a
bit
of
their
recent
harvest
secret
stash
offering
and
works
in
a
similar
fashion
slightly
hoppier
pointing
to
their
raging
bitch
but
without
getting
there
glad
to
see
this
one
hopefully
making
part
of
some
regular
rotation
pricequality
ration
this
is
a
nice
sixpack
overall
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
about
saying
it
is
a
farmhouse
ipa
not
a
very
strong
hop
presence
at
all
tastes
good
though
o
overall
a
nice
belgian
style
yeast
and
some
nice
fruit
in
the
taste
very
nice
body
due
to
the
cask
would
like
to
have
it
again
especially
on
tap
to
see
the
differences
overall
a
very
unusual
tasting
beer
i
guess
it
would
be
better
to
call
it
a
hopped
up
saison
instead
of
a
farmhouse
ipa
i
like
the
dryness
but
as
with
belgian
ipas
i
think
it
is
better
to
leave
belgian
yeast
and
american
hops
separated
o
a
very
different
beer
for
me
i
would
like
a
bit
more
hoppyness
especially
if
they
are
going
to
call
it
an
ipa
iwould
have
it
again
and
as
always
love
the
label
o
color
me
impressed
it
isnt
perfect
but
its
a
solid
hybrid
of
a
saison
and
ipa
and
is
better
balanced
than
raging
bitch
too
recommended
m
on
cask
the
mustiness
is
amplified
a
musttry
if
you
come
across
it
knowing
that
its
been
bottled
ill
be
on
the
lookout
beer
is
light
in
body
airy
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
palate
strong
hop
garden
here
nice
finish
i
enjoyed
this
beer
drinks
a
little
like
a
saison
really
good
beer
here
lots
of
complexity
going
on
and
remeniscent
of
a
hoppy
saison
bold
flavors
dominate
for
sure
and
its
probably
not
for
everyone
but
for
those
who
like
complex
belgianstyle
beers
with
a
healthy
dose
of
hops
definitely
give
this
one
a
go
d
reminds
me
very
much
of
dachouffe
houblon
flavorful
but
a
high
drinkability
factor
wouldnt
hate
to
see
more
offerings
like
this
from
flying
dog
overall
this
has
alot
of
similarities
to
raging
bitch
so
if
you
like
that
beer
like
i
do
then
youll
like
this
one
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
when
it
was
described
to
me
and
i
think
flying
dog
did
a
nice
job
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
hop
bite
but
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
o
good
beer
unique
but
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
anything
else
i
dont
know
the
flavor
profile
in
this
beer
just
seems
kind
of
muddled
and
its
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
this
is
what
the
brewer
was
going
for
when
i
think
how
tasty
raging
bitch
is
i
just
cant
reconcile
that
with
this
beer
cant
see
myself
ordering
this
one
again
the
palate
opens
big
and
juicy
with
a
good
blend
of
citrus
hops
light
oranges
and
plenty
of
fruity
yeasty
phenols
papaya
mango
and
more
tropical
fruit
to
go
with
it
the
honey
and
sugar
aspects
from
the
malt
really
do
amplify
the
yeasty
phenols
bitterness
is
low
for
an
ipa
but
high
for
a
saison
the
more
rustic
and
barnyardy
characters
from
saisons
isnt
really
found
here
either
drying
and
fruit
on
the
finish
the
yeast
does
linger
on
with
plenty
of
tropical
fruit
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
beer
works
imo
this
is
overall
a
great
beer
that
combines
two
hard
hitting
styles
saison
and
ipa
it
is
a
must
try
for
lovers
of
both
a
real
nice
ambush
beer
it
has
a
sense
of
something
fruity
coming
but
not
hoppy
then
it
hits
with
a
surprising
bitter
nice
and
surprising
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
if
you
like
saisons
and
other
lighter
belgian
styles
this
will
hit
the
spot
again
i
find
it
to
be
very
similar
to
secret
stash
but
with
a
higher
abv
and
slightly
more
of
a
hop
profile
not
a
fan
of
that
yeast
strain
whatever
it
is
maybe
im
a
little
biased
being
from
just
an
hour
outside
of
cleveland
but
this
is
a
spectacular
brew
overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
great
even
belgianstyle
pale
ale
lots
of
belgian
yeasty
funkiness
toasted
malt
and
spices
delicious
highly
recommended
overall
a
good
ipa
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
belgium
ipa
a
great
mix
of
hops
with
mild
yeasty
spice
flavors
and
subtle
earthiness
up
front
with
sweetness
from
the
malt
adding
a
grainy
base
bu
mostly
dry
and
herbal
in
flavor
with
a
mix
of
hop
and
yeast
flavor
augmented
by
some
mild
alcohol
and
spice
in
the
finish
which
lasts
a
long
time
overall
a
very
good
belgian
from
the
style
standpoint
with
a
nice
degree
of
drinkability
for
the
strength
i
probably
should
have
tried
this
the
first
time
i
saw
it
for
sale
as
i
like
it
a
lot
and
it
would
have
been
fresher
perhaps
an
earlier
reviewer
said
this
brew
seemed
suspiciously
reminiscent
of
a
tripel
and
i
wholeheartedly
agree
as
soon
as
i
took
my
first
swig
i
got
that
aftershave
bite
that
i
associate
with
tripels
sorry
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
however
that
said
i
am
not
going
to
judge
this
beer
simply
on
the
fact
that
i
dont
like
tripels
the
spacewalker
was
served
to
me
on
tap
and
it
had
a
nice
ambergold
color
with
a
lovely
but
quickly
dissipating
white
head
the
smell
was
of
rich
spices
mixed
with
aftershave
the
taste
being
extremely
similar
however
it
was
also
fairly
smooth
and
i
could
quickly
forgive
the
awful
aftershave
aftertaste
i
wont
be
having
this
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
just
to
say
i
wont
3

o
overall
a
strong

yeasty
attribute
funky
dry
big

very
good
worthy
a
try
complex
full
flavored
belgian
style
with
noticeable
hop
finish
i
wish
i
could
get
this
all
year
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
however
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
try
belgium
style
to
me
soe
spice
and
sourness
almost
drinks
like
a
heffenwiezen
i
hope
to
see
this
again
great

does
excellent
work
with
their
seasonals
and
this
is
no

horribly

totally
alters
the
flavor
overall
a
rather
tasty

with
a
good

still
somewhat

not
the
best
out
there
but
a
nice
try
and
rather
enjoyable
overall
for
just
10
bucks
a

i
could
see
getting
this
again

no

i
really

love

some
great
lakes
right
off
the
bat
poured
from
a
12oz
into
my
snifter
pretty
standard
poured
a
translucent
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
pinky
of
white
head
some
banana
funk
and
maybe
a
bot
of
nutmeg
or
similar
spice
note
on
the
nose
tasted
funky
with
some
interesting
spice
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
discouraging
metallic
note
in
there
too
kind
of
faded
as
the
glass
warmed
light
to
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
the
metallic
aftertaste
interesting
overall
but
not
a
great
experience
on
this
one
shouldnt
kill
my
love
for
gl
though
the
aftertaste
similarly
is
better
on
the
warmed
up
version
this
may
not
be
my
favorite
belgian
far
from
it
and
great
lakes
isnt
really
known
for
this
style
but
this
is
worth
drinking
just
warm
it
up
a
bit
i
like
what
great
lakes
has
done
here
complex
with
plenty
going
on
the
white
pepper
gets
intense
but
it
doesnt
linger
and
there
is
still
a
good
dose
of
hops
for
the
hop
heads
t
grassy
biscuit
and
green
apple
work
at
low
levels
but
they
seem
very
prominent
here
good

i
liked
it
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
is
good
im
not
sure
that
id
buy
it
again
though
ive
had
other
white
ipas
ive
enjoyed
more
than
this
one
and
this
didnt
meet
expectations
served
from
the
tap
the
beer
is
a
transparent
gold
with
a
onefinger
head
along
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
includes
some
belgian
funk
as
hoped
along
with
some
spice
the
taste
follows
but
with
the
addition
of
citrusy
hops
in
the
end
the
hops
prevail
including
a
grapefruity
aftertaste
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
i
would
get
it
again
whenever
im
in
a
hoppy
mood
the
belgian
yeastiness
is
out
of
control
on
this
and
i
cant
say
that
i
enjoyed
it

maybe
this
is
a
stunning
looking
ale
with
a
beautiful
bright
orange
color
and
stiff
foam
head
pepper
clove
and
spice
dominate
the
nose
as
the
belgian
yeast
components
are
at

the
flavor
is
almost
all
yeast
with
peppercorns

and
floral
tones
apple
pear
apricot
and
hop
bitterness
are
also
found
this
is
an
acquired
taste
but
very
flavorful
for
the
style
after
the
first
sip
i
knew
i
was
right
i
was
punched
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
i
thought
that
overall
it
was
a
worthy
selection
overall
i
cant
understand
all
the
negative
reviews
of
this
beer
great
belgian
notes
with
a
high
but
very
nice
bitterness
wish
i
wouldve
picked
up
more
than
one
absolutely
wonderful
im
a
sucker
for
american
belgo
beers
and
tend
to
rate
them
way
over
the
rdev
ive
noticed
i
can
see
why
some
would
be
turned
off
with
this
as
it
sort
of
tastes
like
a
hefe
or
wit
ipa
but
i
like
that
funkiness
its
unusual
as
hell
and
i
absolutely
love
it
weird
thing
is
i
dont
usually
care
for
standard
hefes
or
wits
but
when
those
flavors
are
put
together
into
a
beer
like
this
i
find
it
truly
outstanding
i
often
get
turned
off
for
12oz
beers
that
are
3
a
single
but
this
is
a
beer
id
not
hesitate
having
again
final
thoughts
belgians
may
not
be
my
favorite
family
of
beer
styles
but
that
doesnt
stop
me
from
recognizing
a
great
beer
when
i
taste
one
the
assertive
hop
bitterness
paired
with
the
earthyfruity
belgian
yeast
esters
create
a
multidimensional
flavor
that
just
doesnt
quit
nicely
done
by
a
brewery
thats
renown
for
its
great
lineup
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
not
but
id
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
belgian
ipa
d
this
was
a
decent
tripel
but
not
very
american
nice
scent
and
taste
and
great
body
the
finish
was
a
bit
hot
so
not
the
easiest
to
drink
nice
to
try
once
o
buzz
your
girlfriend
woof
thats
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
great
lakes
is
quite
possibly
my
favorite
brewery
and
i
could
not
be
more
disappointed
in
the
cleveland
boys
for
this
effort
extremely
imbalanced
and
oppressively
dry
yeasty
boozy
and
plasticky
on
the
flavor
profile
i
cannot
believe
this
is
what
glbc
set
out
to
do
and
im
wondering
how
the
hell
this
got
past
qc
this
is
a
black
eyed
embarrassment
for
a
brewery
that
puts
out
such
a
typically
top
notch
product
god
bless
you
if
you
bought
a
whole
4
pack
of
this
i
barely
got
through
5
sips
hello
drain
not
quite
a
4
but
close
and
highly
original
a
bit
too
much
going
on
for
may
palate
overall
drinkability
a
very
good
blend
of
two
styles
of
ipa
an
belgian
pale
ale
distinct
flavors
of
the
two
which
seem
to
compliment
and
not
clash
with
one
another
im
definitely
glad
i
bought
a
4
pack
of
this
and
i
look
forward
to
having
more
of
these
over
the
next
few
weeks
easily
drinkable
with
a
well
hidden
alcohol
but
i
find
its
more
of
a
savoring
beer
rather
than
one
to
be
drank
quickly
the
hops
are
strong
enough
that
theyll
slow
you
down
ale
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
that
lightly
dissipates
to
a
very
thin
white
pool
with
excellent
lacing
nose
of
bittering
hops
light
bread
light
clove
light
candy
malt
and
light
banana
from
the
belgian
yeast
taste
is
almost
a
cross
between
a
farm
house
ale
a
triple
and
a
bitter
ipa
hops
up
front
very
light
sweetness
from
candy
sugars
and
light
clove
hidden
amongst
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
is
on
the
high
side
of
moderate
carbonation
with
a
citrusy
dry
aftertaste
i
would
personally
like
to
try
this
in
a
bottle
to
compare
notes
it
misses
the
mark
from
the
highs
of
triple
dog
dare
which
was
true
to
the
mark
this
is
a
hoppy
mess
i
am
sorry
but
as
a
lover
of
belgian
style
ales
the
over
abundance
of
hops
wrecks
this
brew
a
shame
since
i
am
such
of
a
fan
of
this
brewery
a
rare
miss
from
great
lakes
for
me
the
ester
complexity
is
lacking
and
the
bitterness
overwhelms
reminds
me
of
a
farmhouse
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
and
finishes
nice
and
dry
it
keeps
you
coming
back
for
another
sip
each
time
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
that
will
blow
you
away
it
is
another
enjoyable
brew
from
gl
overall
this
is
basically
a
really
hoppy
triple
which
i
guess
is
different
than
a
belgian
ipa
excellent
beer
if
i
pace
myself
really
slowly
i
dont
like
having
to
think
about
how
to
drink
the
beer
so
much
so
i
really
am
stuck
on
how
to
score
this
overall
a
pretty
solid
twist
on
a
belgian
style
ale
pretty
hoppy
and
bitter
for
the
style
but
it
works
well
for
me

great
lakes
though
i
prefer
much
of
the
rest
of
their
brews
better
a
bit
less
bitterness
on
the
finish
would
improve
it
this
is
a
bold
beer
but
not
as
refined
as
id
expect
from
great
lakes
the
over
the
top
bitterness
hurts
its
solid
but
nothing
crazy
i
would
describe
it
as
an
imperial
belgian
pale
ale
and
makes
me
wish
i
could
have
this
beer
minus
the
belgian
yeasts
id
drink
again
but
i
hope
this
gets
a
tweaking
for
next
release

o
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
hoppiest
beer
in
belgium
but
the
hops
are
there
as
much
for
flavor
as
for
bitterness
the
bitterness
is
rounded
and
not
harsh
very
easy
to
drink

hops
become
the
center
of
attention
while
this
still
drinks
like
a
belgian
ale
due
to
its
distinct
yeast
flavor
with
some
peppery
spices
towards
the
finish

an
almost
herbal

handle
the

well

the

wasnt
much
to

of
the
taste
was
a

quite
clean
and
bitter
nothing
really
stood
out
for

other
than

maybe
i
was

lacks

thank
you
jester
king
this
beer
reminded
me
why
i
got
into
and
enjoy
drinking
craft
beer
it
reminded
me
of
the
first
time
i
had
a
good
european
lager
in
the
mid
80s
golden
hardy
unroasted
malt
backbone
strong
bitter
hop
finish
while
the
malt
takes
first
billing
the
hops
provide
a
perfect
supporting
role
citrusy
slightly
acidic
what
balance
beautify
look
golden
with
a
healthy
white
head
what
really
impressed
me
though
was
the
aroma
a
wonderful
combination
of
malt
and
fruit
fresh
dry
a
masterpiece
sharp
initial
flavor
with
lemon
pith
and
more
peppery
notes
nice
subtle
pilsner
malt
characters
that
blend
well
with
the
sharper
hop
and
yeast
character
spicy
noble
hops
and
some
citrus
notes
from
what
i
would
imagine
are
american
hops
there
are
some
slightly
tart
characters
and
horse
blanketbarnyard
but
this
isnt
overwhelmingly
sour
it
seems
just
a
touch
which
just
rounds
out
this
beer
and
helps
it
finish
dry
leaving
just
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
palate
on
the
spicy
side
for
the
genre
not
bad
not
that
good
but
as
i
said
this
bottle
may
be
past
prime
enjoyed
a
pint
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
a
belgian
ipa
actually
from
belgium
this
brew
presents
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
just
under
an
inch
of
white
foam
on
top
looks
much
like
duvel
or
another
strong
golden
ale
aroma
presages
the
tart
dry
bitterness
to
come
tons
of
styriantype
hops
and
an
astringent
green
apple
pear
and
orange
fruitiness
counterbalanced
by
a
doughy
yeast
sweetness
although
a
subtle
candi
sugar
sweet
note
is
detectable
on
my
palate
this
brew
registers
largely
as
tart
dry
bitter
and
rather
woody
medicinal
hops
leading
the
way
and
closing
out
the
show
with
a
tannic
dry
gooseberry
and
grape
finale
once
the
palate
acclimatizes
to
said
bitterness
you
will
notice
the
fruit
elements
from
the
nose
pear
apple
orange
and
a
classic
belgian
yeast
character
but
this
requires
some
perseverance
if
you
are
unfamiliar
with
this
style
did
i
mention
that
this
beer
is
dry
wellattenuated
body
and
rather
heavy
carbonation
truth
be
told
i
prefer
many
north
american
takes
on
this
style
where
the
fruit
is
more
ripe
and
prominent
on
the
palate
but
this
obviously
has
its
merits
and
is
a
good
benchmark
for
a
classic
genuinely
belgian
hoppy
ale
i
wasnt
too
sure
about
this
one
really
i
quite
enjoyed
the
aroma
how
the
taste
started
out
but
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
incredibly
bitter
finish
to
the
beer
despite
the
fact
that
the
name
should
have
been
an
indication
nothing
in
the
smell
prepared
me
for
just
how
bitter
the
taste
of
this
one
would
end
up
drinkable
but
not
one
ill
go
back
to
prost
medium
body
high
carbonation
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkable
despite
the
bitterness
didnt
last
too
long
in
the
glass
overall
a
good
belgian
ipa
which
i
preferred
with
the
yeast
poured
but
very
good
both
ways
belgian
golden
meets
english
bitter
to
me
here
its
got
the
dry
belgian
yeast
and
great
carbonation
but
also
that
english
grain
profile
and
body
it
has
a
nice
golden
color
cloudy
and
with
some
lingering
yeast
floaters
as
well
as
a
tall
and
bright
white
head
it
smells
like
the
all
too
common
euro
green
bottle
skunk
its
not
old
at
all
but
has
that
stink
to
it
that
is
in
so
many
of
these
behind
that
though
is
a
summery
belgian
yeast
and
what
appears
to
be
a
primarily
wheat
malt
base
the
flavor
has
a
great
grassy
hop
finish
to
it
bitter
and
robust
but
pleasing
and
refreshing
the
malt
is
bigger
than
it
looks
and
has
a
nice
frothy
texture
to
it
combined
with
such
frantic
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
near
perfect
for
the
style
i
wish
i
could
try
it
without
the
staleness
to
it
but
i
like
it
more
as
i
drink
it
more
and
i
can
see
what
its
supposed
to
be
even
through
this
simple
beer
really
but
a
nice
balance
between
yeast
and
hops
the
two
main
flavor
agents
of
this
brew
overpriced
at
about
13
bucks
on
shelves
but
a
tasty
brew
nevertheless
picked
this
up
at
a
great
little
beer
store
in
arlon
belgium
miorge
mihoublon
cloudy

pour
with
a
two

with

and

the
nose
is
herbal
and
grassy
with
hints
of
lemon
grapefruit
subtle
yeast
and

the
taste
lives
up
to
the
name
with
loads
of
bitter
hoppiness
along
with
hints
of
grass
lemon

white

grapefruit
and
subtle

sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
light

sharp
and
tangy
with
a
refreshing
crisp
bitter
dry
finish
overall
this
was
about
what
i
had
expected
considering
that
i
had
already
had
the
xxx
bitter
extremely
bitter
but
quite
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
and
you
cant
beat
the
price
for
a
beer
of
this
quality
wondering
why
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
poured
a
cloudy
yellowish
golden
body
with
great
carbonation
that
gave
a
very
large
foamy
head
that
died
slow
and
left
lace
patches
everywhere
with
a
mild
bitter
hop
aroma
i
mostly
picked
up
some
funk
and
a
little
belgian
yeast
smooth
lighter
bodied
has
this
yeastiness
on
the
edge
that
makes
it
pass
easy
on
the
tongue
and
gives
a
touch
of
sweetness
there
seems
to
be
sourtart
fruit
flavors
like
green
apple
or
pear
and
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
barnyard
funk
some
minor
citric
hop
bitterness
adds
a
little
spice
to
the
beer
mainly
the
finish
and
once
in

while
i
get
some

overall
a
different
take
on
the
ipa
with
approximately
equal
contributions
from
the
yeast
hops
and
malt
i
didnt
enjoy
this
nearly
as
much
as
some
other
belgian
ipas
this
isnt
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
still
damn
good
nice
hop
flavor
with
low

and
plenty
of
belgian
flair
xx
bitter
in
my
opinion
is
one
outstanding
ale
absolutely
delicious
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
feel
like
running
to
the
store
and
picking
up
more
of
these
right
now
two
thumbs
up
im
anxious
to
try
others
from
de
ranke
what
a
superb
beer
refreshing
with
an
assertive
and
elegant
hoppiness
and
still
very
well
balanced
and
with
high
drinkability
and
it
is
not
overly
sweet
which
in
my
opinion
is
an
original
sin
of
several
belgian
brews
and
it
is
much
more
fun
given
the
adequate
hopping
with
a
mild
tartness
o
everything
about
this
beer
is
ok
except
for
the
flavor
yes
it
does
say
that
the
bottling
date
is
five
years
prior
to
the
best
before
date
so
that
means
its
over
a
year
and
a
half
old
but
it
also
says
that
it
will
be
good
up
until
2016
which
i
disagree
with
they
should
just
put
a
bottledon
date
this
beer
is
so
darn
complex
and
refreshing
but
interesting
at

abv
im
maybe
influenced
with
my
rating
based
on
how
much
american
ipas
ive
had
i
love
how
belgian
and
funky
this
beer
is
this
truly
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
having
had
it
again
overall
extremely
dissappointing
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
wasnt
this
do
not
recommend
to
be
honest
im
not
seeing
what
the
big
deal
with
this
beer
is
implications
seemed
to
be
that
this
would
change
my
mind
about
belgian
ipas
its
a
little
different
maybe
and
perhaps
a
bit
more
cohesive
but
it
still
strikes
me
as
quite
a
middleoftheroad
drop
overall
a
solid
belgian
ipa
that
had
more
of
a
belgian
feel
than
a
hoppy
one
that
i
get
with
american
versions
of
this
style
the
beer
has
a
super
dry
finish
left
me
wanting
to
have
another
one
yet
there
are
others
in
the
style
i
would
go
to
first
i
really
do
love
this
beer
despite
its
bittered
excessiveness
theres
a
lot
of
wonderful
fruity
esters
and
a
dried
citrus
finish
that
makes
it
really
unique
and
sublime
this
pairs
with
spicy
food
like
a
charm
as
well
as
fried
fish
with
lemons
and
pesto
pasta
which
is
what
i
had
this
with
fans
of
tripels
and
colorful
bitter
beers
must
try
this
for
sure
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
yeast
and
some
peppery
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
grain
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
flavors
dont
match
up
to
the
smells
i
am
getting
on
this
one
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
white
cap
trails
of
lace
all
over
the
glass
as
i
drank
this
down
spices
and
earthy
grassy
hops
come
through
the
nose
as
a
touch
of
light
pale
malt
and
honey
wafts
through
as
well
very
light
citrus
tone
too
the
flavor
is
of
crackers
earth
nutty
yeast
pears
and
other
lighter
fruits
golden
raisins
spice
a
medium
body
with
a
fair
amount
of

very
nice
o
i
find
this
beer
disappointingly
onedimensional
there
is
a
bit
of
brettanomyces
character
in
the
end
of
a
swallow
but
there
is
a
lack
of
malt
to
round
out
and
balance
the
strong
hops
im
not
a
hophead
so
i
find
this
one
disappointing
appearance
many
white
foam
mostly
inconsistent
there
remains
a
layer
thickness
of
a
finger
for
several
minutes
passes
before
stabilizing
at
a
thickness
of
half
finger
many
brands
irregular
foam
from
the
maximum
height
reached
to
serve
hazy
blond
color
mse
gaseous
seen
intense
activity
coming
from
the
background
as
if
boiling
the
boil
is
very
curious
aroma
in
the
first
instant
herbal
flavor
that
gives
way
after
a
bitter
notes
that
smell
becomes
final
i
like
taste
no
shades
or
is
especially
attractive
i
expected
a
very
intense
bitterness
but
is
moderate
very
ordinary
except
for
the
bitterness
that
again
is
present
and
is
intensifying
but
without
being
excessive
easily
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
nothing
more
okay
to
accompany
nibbles
like
some
fries
or
a
rough
and
in
that
sense
is
a
good
alternative
to
the
plague
of
european
lager
but
nothing
more
overall
rating
not
rated
i
think
its
okay
to
consider
it
more
like
an
orval
for
example
for
me
there
is
more
than
a
good
quality
lager
i
said
if
your
budget
allows
alternative
to
a
common
european
lager

its

its
still
surely
drinkable
still
a
must
have
for
any
burgeoning

beer
enthusiast
o
this
beer
is
growing
on
me
certainly
worth
trying
for
a
change
amongst
belgian
beers
id
compare
to
orval
trappist
beer
and
russian
rivers
damnation
tip
o
truly
outstanding
a
beer
that
i
have
do
will
continue
to
aspire
to
brew
as
a
homebrewer
overall
i
am
pleased
im
always
excited
to
try
something
from
de
ranke
as
its
fairly
difficult
to
come
by
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
this
beer
did
not
dissapoint
and
for
the
price
would
happily
buy
it
again
o
has
grainy
and
big
belgian
character
definity
interesting
and
well
worth
a
purchase
just
make
sure
you
have
some
time
to
sit
and
let
the
head
settle
o
definitely
for
advanced
beerheads
this
being
my
first
a
big
part
of
the
enjoyment
was
the
novelty
this
is
a
very
original
beer
that
like
a
lot
of
belgians
doesnt
neatly
fit
into
any
style
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
xx
bitter
has

at

i
now
realize
is
something
closer
to
a
crowd
pleaser
if
one
is
already
inclined
towards
belgians
and
craft
beer
that
is
overall
a
very

bipa
i
will
add
this
one
to
the
list
very

pepper
clove
herbal
floral
pineapple
and
yeast
spices
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
great
flavor
balance
and
complexity
no
cloying
flavors
at
all
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
crisp
and
lightly
prickly
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
at
all
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
belgian
ipa
great
flavor
balance
and
complexity
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
highly
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
very
good
beer
at
13
a
bottle
i
expect
a
little
more
because
of
the
price
ill
probably
stick
to
the
le
chouffee
ipa
which
i
prefer
this
beer
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
duvel
triple
hop
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
belgian
ipa
nice
hop
flavor
profile
and
a
nice
aroma
give
it
a
go
o
very
interesting
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
although
it
seems
to
be
more
of
an
experimental
brew
very
good
overall
its
a
nice
beer
but
still
in
doubt
how
to
judge
this
one
i
like
the
hoppy
dry
grapefruit
bitter
together
with
the
more
wet
and
easy
fruity
sweet
flavors
i
love
the
effect
and
development
of
the
flavors
in
your
mouth
but
it
does
feel
just
a
tad
too
much
to
the
bittergrapefruit
side
to
really
enjoy
any
day
i
really
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
just
lacks
the
final
word
in
balance
but
im
sure
if
youre
a
fan
of
these
flavors
youll
love
this
one
overall
surprised
that
i
havent
tried
this
before
as
i
have
tasted
many
other
belgian
ipas
over
the
years
this
apparently
is
the
original
and
is
well
worth
seeking
out
handsome
paperwrapped
corked
and
caged
bottle
but
the
price
tag
is
a
tad
steep

750ml
washed
down
my
gullet
in
less
than
60
minutes
a
worldclass
belgian
pale
o
highly
enjoyable
and
thirstquenching
despite
dominant
bitterness
not
very
complex
but
at
least
im
finally
tasting
a
belgian
ipa
that
has
some
distinctive
character
not
just
a
random
strong
pale
ale
with
a
bit
more
hops
than
usual
d
what
seem
to
be
pils
malt
and
noble
hop
creates
a
lot
of
similarity
between
this
one
and
a
pils
yeast
is
understated
and
the
beer
isnt
too
ale
fruity
belgian
ipa
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
poured
into
a
gulden
draak

a
cloudy
light
orange
amber
two
finger
medium
white
head
with
nice
lacing
aroma
of
funky
herbal
hops
light
sour
fruit
interesting
belgian
yeast
light
fruit
starts
as
a
belgian
light
ale
quickly
followed
by
hop
bitterness
that
has
a
strong
floral
component
finish
is
semisweet
malt
and
hop
bitterness
quite
different
and
tasty
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
nicely
made
and
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
it
had
a
nice
hoppiness
to
it
with
the
yeast
spice
and
pale
malts
complimenting
well
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
of
the
style
overall
o
a
drinkable
beer
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
a
bit
overdone
also
wished
they
would
have
used
less
earthy
hops
to
bring
more
focus
on
fruity
yeast
flavors
would
drink
again
if
readily
available
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
obtain
it
cheers
beertracker
o
seriously
this
is
a
beauty
i
have
walked
past
this
on
the
shelf
so
many
times
before
giving
it
a
shot
if
you
like
belgian
flavours
do
yourself
a
favour
and
pick
one
up
at
next
opportunity
pretty
fun
beer
and
nice
to
have
a
hoppy
belgian
for
a
change
really
enjoy
this
one
11
2oz
bottle
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
poured
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
couple
of
fingers
of
white
head
plenty
of
carbonation
bottle
conditioned
citrus
hop
aroma
with
an
earthiness
that
seemed
a
little
off
imo
sweet
malt
up
front
with
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bitterness
for
a
belgian
beer
a
little
belgian
yeast
profile
fairly
drying
finish
from
the
hops
o
kind
of
onedimensional
thanks
to
the
bitterness
but
still
delicious
and
very
drinkable
thanks
to
the
bitterness
good
stuff
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
looking
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
head
left
behind
some
good
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
lots
of
belgian
hop
aromas
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
earthy
and
very
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
dries
out
the
mouth
really
quick
overall
this
brew
is
pretty
good
i
like
that
they
are
attempting
the
hoppiest
beer
in
belgium
i
think
thats
pretty
cool
poured
a
2
white
head
body
is
a
clear
light
lemon
color
kind
of
pretty
smell
and
taste
both
bring
the
hops
in
clean
fruity
sweet
bitter
expressions
the
label
claims
this
is
the
hoppiest
beer
of
belgium
yeah
its
hoppy
but
im
not
sure
their
claim
would
stand
up
in
the
us
this
would
be
a
more
midrange
ipa
for
a
6
2
beer
this
is
a
behemoth
an
uncompromising
bitter
tart
and
slightly
funky
brew
that
lies
somewhere
in
between
a
saison
and
a
lambic
poured
into
a
gouden
carolus
goblet
the
beer
is
a
hazy
honey
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
nice
hop
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
hoppy
as
well
as
the
beer
leans
on
the
bitter
side
with
a
nice
belgian
yeast
flavor
while
finishing
dry
a
good
velvety
feel
to
it
the
carbonation
assists
the
bitterness
o
after
the
great
looks
and
smells
i
hoped
for
a
little
bit
more
i
bit
too
hoppy
for
me
but
can
i
blame
the
ranke
the
warning
was
xxbitter
o
a
really
good
beer
that
went
down
exceedingly
quickly
i
like
the
refined
earthiness
with
nice
herbal
tones
and
a
solid
underlying
bitterness
on
a
biscuity
malt
foundation
i
will
be
looking
out
for
more
of
this
without
a
doubt
overall
this
is
a
style
i
could
really
get
behind
but
it
lacks
the
intensity
i
was
expecting
perhaps
im
too
used
to
americanstyle
iipas
this
one
is
quite
easy
to
drink
while
still
having
a
very
distinctive
hop
character
and
a
fantastic
aroma
drink
it
was
a
nice
little
beer
to
start
the
day
but
the
flavors
just
didnt
work
all
that
well
for
me
o
in
my
opinion
this
beer
has
the
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
despite
being
named
xx
bitter
the
bitterness
is
there
but
it
doesnt
overpower
any
of
the
other
unique
facets
such
as
the
belgian
yeast
strain
complex
mix
of
spices
i
wont
even
pretend
that
i
know
these
and
overall
funky
saisonlike
character
according
to
my
coworker
who
is
friends
with
the
shelton
brothers
they
both
quit
their
jobs
and
starting
importing
belgian
beers
after
tasting
de
ranke
xx
bitter
thank
you
sheltons
o
i
would
absolutely
have
this
beer
again
it
is
the
first
i
have
had
of
the
style
and
it
sure
wont
be
the
last
maybe
i
will
stop
practicing
law
and
start
importing
beer
havent
reviewed
many
belgians
but
this
was
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
for
an
ipa
drinker
jd
an
outstanding
ipa
mostly
because
of
what
it
is
not
overall
see
my
notes
on
taste
if
offered
this
vs
an
average
american
ipa
theres
no
question
id
choose
an
american
ipa
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
od
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
i
was
already
a
fan
of
belgian
golden
ales
and
ipas
and
this
is
an
excellent
combination
of
the
two
if
youre
an
ipa
fan
that
is
thinking
about
trying
some
belgians
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
this
one
up
the
palate
opens
beautifully
balanced
with
a
blend
of
bretty
clove
phenols
moderately
resiny
hop
flavors
with
some
mint
herbaceousness
and
a
little
pine
and
a
delicate
cotton
candy
malt
backbone
the
malt
is
really
simple
here
a
light
mildly
doughy
mildly
honeylike
sugar
drying
and
bitter
on
the
finish
with
lingering
clove
and
bretty
phenols
this
beer
is
light
in
body
and
highly
carbonated
despite
this
it
feels
just
right
on
the
palate
a
little
creamy
even
drying
refreshing
and
wellcrafted
what
more
could
one
want
o
great
classic
beer
pours
hazy
orange
gold
with
a
frothy
sizeable
head
that
recedes
slowly
aroma
of
yeasty
funk
floral
hops
and
sweet
malts
with
citrus
accents
inital
taste
of
grass
pine
and
citrus
followed
by
an
overpowering
bitterness
that
lasts
through
the
finish
into
sometime
next
tuesday
hops
taste
real
fresh
i
guess
they
dont
call
it
xx
bitter
for
nothing
this
is
one
of
the
bigger
belgians
ive
had
but
isnt
truly
balanced
it
is
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
is
bitter
and
tasty
o
this
bottle
was
like
a
slightly
skunked
fresh
saison
it
was
enjoyable
but
the
skunk
thing
was
just
a
little
distracting
to
be
honest
im
not
sure
if
its
actual
skunking
or
its
supposed
to
be
this
funkymustyslightly
almost
spoiled
but
the
first
rush
of
aroma
was
like
a
skunk
walked
by
my
window
its
an
interesting
beer
if
it
is
indeed
skunked
and
old
i
could
see
how
this
could
be
solid
when
fresh
as
is
i
would
probably
be
a
little
upset
if
this
was
my
home
brew
hazy
yellow
slightly
orange
and
the
pour
formed
a
big
bubbly
offwhite
head
biscuit
malt
aroma
along
with
a
big
burst
of
floralfruity
hops
tangerine
and
mango
faint
amounts
of
fresh
hay
a
strong
aroma
of
champagne
yeast
blends
in
as
well
compared
to
the
nose
the
flavor
is
very
different
the
fruity
side
of
the
hops
has
been
masked
and
it
has
become
a
lemon
bite
with
an
earthy
hay
finish
a
lot
of
bread
slightly
wheat
malt
which
has
a
subtle
sourness
make
up
the
body
the
yeast
adds
a
spicysour
fruit
character
and
gives
the
creamy
body
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
and
not
a
lot
of
bitter
bite
most
likely
the
hoppiest
belgian
beer
ive
had
so
far
im
a
malt
man
normally
but
this
was
fine
for
me
any
more
hops
however
and
id
not
be
so
generous
with
my
review
or
scores
overall
good
beer
not
a
big
belgian
fan
but
the
heavyhanded
hops
in
this
one
made
me
happy
overall
this
beer
is
good
easy
drinker
very
refreshing
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipa
ive
tasted
so
far
o
i
kind
of
expected
more
from
this
beer
since
it
is
touted
as
a
world
class
beer
and
is
offered
throughout
different
beer
stores
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
one
again
whether
that
is
a
matter
of
freshness
or
not
i
am
not
sure
as
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
tried
this
beer
but
it
said
on
the
side
that
it
should
be
consumed
by
march
21
2015
so
i
guess
this
isnt
the
case
a
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
and
light
bodied
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
from
the
flavor
but
not
bad
id
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
sometime
o
overall
it
is
well
executed
but
overall
not
that
memorable
drinks
well
for
the
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
what
makes
it
for
me
o
a
very
solid
bipa
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
not
as
carbonated
as
i
was
expecting
but
good
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
a
bit
pricey
for
a
daily
drinker
but
worth
coming
back
to
again
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
ive
had
pale
straw

into
my
snifter
glass

with

good

carbonation

too
opens
the
door
to
a
subtle
kind
bitterness
in
your
mouth
well
balanced

dry
bitterness
will
remain
in
your
palate

excelent

refreshing
sensation
may
i
have
one
more
please
finish
is
heavy

bitter
character
d
abv
becomes
apparent
from
the
bitterness
of
the
phenols
although
inherently
i
think
it
wouldnt
have
been
felt
some
sips
were
very
tasty
others
just
bothered
me
from
the
phenols
good
though
the
hops
are
overwhelmed
by
yeastderived
phenols
in
the
flavor
which
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
although
the
slight
plasticy
phenols
detract
from
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
beer
the
best
belgian
ipa
i
have
had
so
far
certainly
will
buy
and
enjoy
it
again
dnicely
balnaced
and
very
easy
and
tasty
to
drink
mild
yet
pleasant
flavors
nice
belgian
yeast
presence
and
a
well
integrated
hop
profile
d
good
if
you
like
a
bitter
beer
otherwise
that
bitterness
will
slow
you
down
surprisingly
aggressive
pungent
hoppiness
on
par
with
a
wellhopped
american
ipa
hoppiest
nonus
brew
ive
ever
had
the
focus
on
european
hops
is
a
really
nice
change
of
pace
the
earthy
herbaceous
hops
are
held
up
by
sweet
malts
with
lots
of
light
fruit
esters
its
sort
of
a
cross
between
an
ampedup
english
ipa
and
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
reminds
me
of
houblon
chouffe
dobbelen
ipa
tripel
except
this
one
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
very
good
beer
overall
a
very
nice
very
drinkable
beer
will
definitely
try
this
one
again
drinkability
rates

wish
it
was

and
the

was

mouth
dry

very

somewhat

again
a
touch

but
its

could

from

i
was

to

more

quite
belgian
if
you
like
belgian
beers
youll
like
this
this
bottle
was
dated
april
2009
so
its
a
year
and
half
past
its
best
by
date
it
poured
a
dirty
burnt
orange
with
a
lot
of
sediment
and
a
one
finger
off
white
head
it
smells
great
for
its
age
it
is
very
heavy
on
the
orange
very
heavy
there
is
some
malty
sweetness
but
the
defined
hops
have
faded
the
flavor
is
very
interesting
its
a
sweet
orange
flavor
with
little
hops
or
malt
it
has
slight
yeastiness
it
drinks
light
to
medium
bodied
and
is
pretty
tasty
id
love
to
see
what
its
like
fresh
if
it
was
this
good
six
years
old
unless
it
is
so
well
balanced
that
i
am
undercutting
the
hoppiness
i
would
rate
it
about
55
65
ibus
but
im
believing
that
it
is
the
well
rounded
profile
causing
me
to
shoot
in
that
range
still
as
they
claim
hoppy
for
a
belgian
d
pretty
good
as
far
as
these
things
go
a
bitter
belgian
with
the
trademark
de
ranke
funk
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer

probably
one

spiciness
smells
light
and
dry
may
just
be
my
bottle
but
picking
up
a
slightly
skunky
smell
cant
remember
the
scientific
chemical
name
right
off
hand
but
i
assume
that
it
is
intentional
high
carbonation
the
spice
and
cloviness
smelled
in
the
aroma
is
barely
present
in
the
taste
some
bready
notes
dry
hop
finnish
dryness
later
joined
by
citris
aftertaste
very
light
and
refreshing
not
quite
as
bitter
as
i
was
expecting
to
have
it
so
advertised
on
the
bottle
but
still
good
dcertainly
nice
stuff
and
while
the
hop
profile
isnt
quite
my
cup
of
tea
for
the
style
i
cannot
deny
its
goodness
a
very
well
done
beer
for
sure
this
is
the
closest
thing
to
an
acrid
west
coast
american
ipa
that
i
have
experienced
of
the
belgian
variety
of
course
in
this
case
the
hop
flavour
profile
differs
as
it
should
but
the
bitterness
remains
along
with
yer
typical
pervasive
yeastiness
im
used
to
maltheavy
belgian
offerings
nice
to
see
one
more
given
to
the
hoppy
side
of
the
coin
d
a
very
nice
belgian
ipa
if
you
never
had
one
before
try
this
one
d
with
a
tame
abv
like
this
and
a
complexity
that
deserves
a
devotion
of
time
this
could
definately
be
a
session
beer
if
you
could
both
afford
it
and
find
it
t
much
more
balanced
than
in
the
nose
in
fact
very
nice
of
course
the
hops
are
the
focus
piney
slightly
floral
but
there
is
a
light
sweetness
and
a
bready
malt
character
there
to
balance
also
paired
with
a
uniquely
belgian
yeast
character
this
beer
is
really
unmissable
i
was
expecting
5
0
drinkability
but
i
have
to
knock
it
a
couple
notches
i
find
that
the
flowery
bitterness
almost
becomes
tiresome
as
i
progress
through
the
bottle
still
this
is
a
very
solid
extrahopped
belgian
blonde
would
have
gladly
have
another
but
next
time
im
splitting
it
with
someone
so
this
is
the
beer
that
spawned
all
the
belgian
ipas
cheers
it
would
seem
to
me
that
every
ba
should
drink
at
least
one
bottle
of
this
d
a
good
drinker
xx
bitter
leaves
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
that
makes
you
want
more
the
hops
are
slightly
more
prevalent
than
the
fruits
and
flavorings
but
give
a
good
bouquet
if
youre
looking
for
hops
this
is
the
right
direction
i
can
see
the
orval
comparison
many
other
writers
are
commenting
on
will
definitely
aim
to
have
both
in
a
session
sometime
soon
to
compare
the
two
this
is
a
really
great
belgium
ipa
nice
floral
nose
with
notes
of
yeast
and
wheat
extremely
balanced
almost
makes
me
crave
the
unbalance
of
a
dipa
nice
notes
of
wheat
hit
the
palate
with
a
phenolic
finish
a
very
drinkable
and
surprisingly
refreshing
beer
ah
a
great
brew
here
i
prefer
the
american
hops
in
most
of
the
newer
belgian
ipas
but
this
brew
is
a
classic
d
high
refreshing
the
low
abv
helps
a
lot
and
the
bitterness
is
a
must
highly
suggested
to
bitterness
lovers

of
white

that
leaves
minimal
stick
a
nice
ring
around
the
glass
scents
dont
exactly
burst
out
at
you
obviously
there
is
some
hops
and
very
low
traces
of
malt
sweet
backing
some
warming
brings
a
fuller
bouquet
with
small
citrus
grass
clippings
and
the
bitterness
deepens
a
bit
first
swigs
im
just
like
eh
but
overtime
this
did
turn
out
to
be
quite
bitter
but
not
overpowering
not
really
tropical
more
down
to
earth
small
lemons
and
grass
light
malt
sweet
back
light
as
can
be
pretty
bitter
on
the
mouth
this
lives
up
to
its
name
the
low
abv
makes
for
less
malt
and
sugars
used
so
this
is
on
the
hoppy
side
i
liked
it
alot

hard
to
believe
it

the

per
the

nonetheless
quite
easy
drinking
for
the

d
easy

pleasant
balance
of

i
wouldnt
pick
it
over
a
good
amerian
ipa
but
thats
just
my
opinion
lacks
the
hop
complexity
that
i
love
so
much
slow
progression
of
some
really
unique
and
interesting
flavors
strong
bitterness
but
it
fits
into
the
range
of
flavors
like
a
puzzle
piece
balanced
and
suiting
every
sip
tastes
better
i
keep
noticing
new
complexities
clean
citrousy
hops
spicy
not
very
scorching
to
the
palate
i
like
american
ipas
more
but
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
worth
trying
d
this
was
not
super
clean
but
it
was
definitely
a
hoppy
belgian
ale
body
was
ok
and
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
aside
from
the
lasting
bitterness
but
im
generally
not
impressed
with
this
beer
330ml

light
with

some

this

beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
d
really
good

making

this
beer
tastes
exactly
like
one
wouldshould
expect
from
a
belgian
ipa
the
hops
are
quite
present
and
taste
really
nice
especially
paired
with
the
heavy
belgian
yeast
component
the
carbonation
level
is
solid
and
the
beer
has
a
decent
feel
overall
this
is
a
wellcrafted
brew
and
a
solid

of
the
style

in

in
the

there
isnt

up

the

rather
subdued
drinkability

overall
its
a

thin
and
a
little
too
dry
update
i
had
this
a
second
time
and
it
was
very
weird
every
time
i
took
a
sip
it
exploded
into
fizz
so
it
wasnt
actual
flowing
liquid
it
was
actually
had
to
drink
i
will
have
to
try
again
to
see
if
this
was
a
oneoff

and
a

of

as
the
beer
warmed
the
taste
starts
upfront
with
a
firm

backbone
not
too
sweet
may
be
pilsener
malt
a
really
hoppy
middle
a
bit
grassy

floral
leading
to
a
quite
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
decent
effervescence
leading
to
a
fairly
dry
finish
probably
attributable
to
the
belgian
yeast
may
have
lost
a
bit
of
the
hop
presence
due
to
a
bit
aged
of
a
keg
but
this
was
certainly
one
of
the
best
belgian
ipas
ive
had
recommended
brewers
gold
and
hallertau
dont
really
do
it
for
me
hopwise
but
i
could
see
if
thats
youre
thing
this
is
a
great
beer
this
is
a
classic

drinkable

sessionable

in

light
for

overall
its

drinkable
and
the

augment
as

but
not
the
tastiest
bipa
ive
ever
had
especially
for
the
price
wanted
to
try
this
one
glad
i
did
will
buy
again
and
would
love
to
have
on
tap
overall
as
bitter
as
it
says
it
is
i
can
believe
that
this
at
least
competes
for
the
most
bitter
beer
in
belgium
enjoyable
enough
but
a
little
one
dimensional
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
d
its
not
nearly
as
big
as
other
belgian
ipas
and
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
flavors
some
of
them
offer
but
i
can
definitely
appreciate
something
that
isnt
going
to
sink
me
after
one
its
hot
and
humid
out

de
ranke

bitter
manages
to
be
refreshing
while

the

and
a

more

with

proper

goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
nicely
balanced
and
i
could
certainly
have
a
few
of
these
d
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
have
had
much
better
belgian
ipas
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out

some

a

smelled
hoppier
when
i
opened
the
bottle
though
was
big
when
i
popped
the
cap
taste
is
hoppy
but
fairly
balanced
the
spices
are
right
there
too
quite
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
really
dry
stinging
finish
as
i
gulp
this
pretty
good
belgian
ipa
only
my
second
ever
though
so
im
not
one
to
judge
d
very
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
one
of
my
new
favorite
styles
this
one
brings
some
real
bite
can
wear
after
a
little
but
still
delicious
if
anything
its
overcarbonated
the
tingle
of
the
carbonation
gets
in
the
way
of
the
bite
but
its
still
good
malty
too
finished
it
rather
quickly
regardless
of
hopbeaten
tongue
id
say
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
found
this
at
a
fine
foods
shop
across
from
my
new
apartment
and
i
think
it
may
get
a
spot
in
the
regular
rotation
if
you
come
across
it
grab
it
immediately
d
this
is
a
really
good
belgian
ipa
after
drinking
so
many
north
american
ipas
its
nice
to
go
to
the
belgian
style
to
realize
not
every
ipa
has
to
knock
you
out
with
the
hops
very
subtle
and
enjoyable
d
too
drinkable
can
not
wait
to
find
on

750ml
decanted

a
cordendonk
tall
tulip
glass
hazy
straw
pour
with
a
stiff
though
short
lived
head
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
smell
and
taste
were
vastly
different
overall
its
good
but
not
great
another
good
one
so
far
all
my
favorite
belgian
ipas
are
the
ones
made
in
belgium
this
is
no
exception
easily
drinkable
despite
its
complexity
nothing
special

finish

very
dry
carbonation
is
fairly
high
and
body

interesting
brew
id
like
to
revisit
again
quite
a
nice
beer
this
plenty
of
character
but
still
light
enough
to
leave
you
waiting
for
the
next
sip
d
a
sophisticated
and
worldly
sipper
not
my
favorite
but
a
highly
recommended
and
much
appreciated
belgian
ipa
none
the
less
a
brew
the
a
wine
drinker
may
truly
appreciate
this
one
is
going
down
fairly
easy
and
without
any
complains
d
extremely
sessionable
pairs
as
well
as
a
pairing
can
be
i
drink
this
a
session
beer
when
i
can
and
hope
i
never
tire
of
it
a
deliciously
dry
belgian
ipa
a
it
may
be
the
hoppiest
but
it
isnt
the
best
belgian
ipa
though
it
is
solid
drinkability
i
liked
it
but
mostly
because
it
was
interesting
and
different
its
not
going
to
make
my
top
10
list
of
beers
i
cant
wait
to
drink
i
might
have
one
again
sometime
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
different
and
a
bit
funky
slainte
d
i
need
to
seek
out
more
belgian
ipas
what
a
unique
flavor
profile
in
this
one
a
very
bitter
pale
ale
more
than
any
kind
of
ipa
all
ibus
over
hop
flavor
notes
most
bitter
and
probably
the
hoppiest
belgian
ipa
i
have
tried
that
said
it
is
definitely
a
belgian
yeast
good
every
once
in
a
while
beer
especially
if
you
are
craving
hops
and
a
bit
of
funk
d
a
very
nice
belgian
ipa
very
clean
and
refreshing
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
certainly
isnt
and
shouldnt
be
a
belgian
ipa
this
seems
to
strike
what
the
brewery
is
seeking
to
do
nonetheless
it
could
be
refined
a
bit
further
to
round
out
some
edges
which
grate
a
little
bit
while
my
review
differs
quite
substantially
from
others
the
bottling
date
on
my
bottle
indicates
that
this
beer
is
under
a
year
old
so
freshness
shouldnt
be
an
issue
o
mild
but
very
smooth
lots
of
bitterness
great
hoppy
belgian
beer
golden
color
with
greenish
reflections
probably
due
to
a
resinous
hops
the
nose
is
hoppy
and
mouth
following
the
same
path
is
to
be
both
safe
tough
and
bitter
the
palate
is
intense
and
shows
the
power
and
quality
of
hopping
the
holding
of
mouth
is
also
impressive
it
also
presents
similarities
with
orval
where
visàvis
the
latter
it
gains
in
power
hop
what
it
loses
in
complexity
a
beer
of
high
quality
i
love
hoppy
beers
and
since
the
abv
is
low
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
most
enjoy
this
in
the
warm
summer
months
while
sitting
on
the
deck
pours
with
a
cloudy
yelloworange
body
with
a
big
rocky
white
head
and
very
heavy
carbonation
very
floral
aromas
with
a
heavy
citrus
slant
slightly
soapy
and
an
unmistakable
belgian
yeastiness
the
taste
is
like
the
nose
with
a
clear
floral
character
upfront
followed
by
a
bitter
hoppiness
there
is
a
sweet
malt
back
bone
which
has
a
butter
popcorn
taste
and
a
light
caramel
really
great
beer
very
light
and
drinkable
completely
missed
the
brett
its
nothing
like
orval
as
the
description
suggests
750
ml
bottle
best
before
the
end
of
may
2014
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
aroma
is
lemon
peppery
spice
belgian
yeast
and
a
bit
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
a
nice
lingering
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
well
carbonated
and
finishes
dry
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
its
very
enjoyable
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
id
definitely
buy
this
again
pours
cloudy
yellowcopper
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
okay
lacing
soapy
herbal
earthy
aroma
some
funk
but
it
may
be
from
the
yeasthop
mix
effervescent
mouthfeel
dry
finish
very
hoppy
bitter
earthy
bite
with
faint
belgian
funk
and
spice
kind
of
a
weird
blend
reminiscent
of
urthels
hop
it
i
dont
know
it
just
feels
unbalanced
an
exceptionally
drinkable
brew
and
one
which
highlights
what
the
belgians
do
best
ive
recently
been
drinking
huge
and
flavoursome
us
craft
brews
and
this
beer
puts
them
in
context
it
shows
what
you
can
do
with
a
more
moderate
taste
profile
by
blending
disparate
elements
flawlessly
and
providing
impeccable
balance
this
is
a
big
winner
good
drinkability
for
a
belgian
pale
i
like
the
bitternessfrom
midtaste
through
the
finish
and
aftertaste
theres
a
good
malt
base
lots
of
ground
pepper
spritzy
but
with
a
good
body
d
superb
it
has
the
smooth
perfectly
balanced
taste
of
an
english
bitter
with
the
added
complexity
of
a
belgian
ale
and
the
moderate
abv
makes
it
very
sessionable
a
classic
bitter
near
the
top
of
the
style
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
this
is
my
first
review
so
bear
with
the
perhapsshaky
evaluation
language
i
may
have
poured
the
beer
a
wee
bit
too
cold
because
flavors
became
more
complex
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
bottle
one
of
the
better
belgian
ipas
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
will
give
it
another
chance
in
the
future
pours
a
very
cloudy
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
some
spotty
lacing
is
left
that
seems
characteristic
of
belgian
style
beers
cloudyness
is
accpeted
in
this
style
so
no
points
can
be
docked
for
that
however
it
does
not
appear
all
that
appetizing
smells
like
belgian
malts
and
yeast
the
nose
is
not
huge
for
me
here
some
citrus
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
here
is
great
i
wasnt
sure
it
would
be
this
way
after
the
nose
a
very
complex
taste
and
a
bitterness
you
will
not
find
in
most
american
beers
it
is
as
if
they
extracted
the
hop
bitterness
and
removed
a
lot
of
the
hop
flavors
this
is
probably
the
most
bitter
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
just
a
straight
up
bitter
slam
with
no
huge
hoppy
notes
some
pine
and
earth
but
not
overpowering
very
cool
also
in
here
is
the
belgian
malts
yeast
and
citrus
lemon
and
lime
peel
can
be
tasted
giving
the
beer
even
more
great
flavor
this
beers
taste
is
probably
the
most
unique
ipa
taste
i
have
sampled
thus
far
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
mf
suits
the
flavor
very
well
and
feels
nice
no
warming
in
this
beer
at
all
a
nice
bitter
coat
left
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
the
amazing
taste
is
something
that
shouldnt
be
overlooked
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
and
the
bitterness
will
certainly
get
overpowering
after
a
while
if
i
see
this
on
tap
again
i
will
probably
have
another
but
wont
be
buying
the
rather
expensive
bottle
anytime
soon
which
i
have
had
and
must
say
i
prefer
the
tap
version
by
a
long
shot
d
crisp
flavors
and
low
abv
this
is
very
drinkable
ill
give
de
ranke
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
assume
i
had
a
lightstruck
version
light
to
medium
body
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
enjoyable
all
around
not
very
strong
making
it
one
of
the
more
sessionable
belgians
around
taste
is
awesome
screw
miller
this
is
the
champagne
of
beers
dry
and
smooth
quite
carbonated
but
still
very
smooth
very
sharp
an
tasty
an
awesome
beer
d
ehh
o
k
but
i
am
disappointed
in
this
expensive
import
which
features
a
taste
that
is
close
to
many
that
can
be
found
stateside

grapefruitgrass

tropical

make

the

theres
also
some

slightly
funky

in
the
mix
medium

and
mediumhigh
carbonation
feels
about
right
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
hop
flavor
in
this
belgian
beer
it
was
not
as
dominate
as
some
hop
flavors
in
american
ipas
which
i
like
but
it
was
great
to
try
a
belgian
with
hop
flavor
not
as
bitter
as
i
expected
from
the
label
but
still
a
very
tart
citrusy
hopped
brew
decent
carbonation
but
not
quite
a
session
ale
a
nice
sipper
though
d
could
drink
a
bunch
based
on
abv
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
should
not
be
passed
by
d
very
nice
overall
i
cant
believe
those
wa
breweries
would
make
such
an
obvious
ripoff
of
xxxx
and
make
it
so
obviously
worse
xx
bitter
is
the
most
pathetic
excuse
for
a
beer
ever
d
definitely
not
a
session
style
but
not
nearly
as
trying
to
drink
as
other
beers
of
this
caliber
i
could
definitely
see
going
for
another
but
obviously
not
too
many
after
that
a
very
good
beer
but
better
when
fresh
in
belgium
the
bottle
i
had
at
the
cafe
across
the
road
from
the
mannequin
pis
was
to
die
for
d
very
refreshing
good
balance
great
taste
d
this
really
is
orval
turned
up
to
11
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
for
an
ipa
of
this
strength
with
a
sharp
carbonation
well
done
pour
is
golden
with
a
beautiful
head
tight
white
and
with
time
contracted
head
smell
is
a
minty
pine
and
lavender
palate
so
crisp
its
soapy
quite
clear
and
very
bright
strong
floral
that
clears
the
tongue
dry
mint
lavender
a
light
bitter
and
thyme
definitely
wonderful
hop
quality
drinkability
is
very
much
here
and
with
an
abv
at
6
you
could
certainly
indulge
in
more
than
one
of
these
delicious
d
this
was
a
top
beer
ive
actually
had
this
sitting
around
for
a
few
months
and
it
probably
wasnt
at
its
freshest
to
begin
with
id
love
to
try
this
fresh
it
was
still
very
good
and
im
so
tempted
to
go
put
the
2nd
bottle
in
the
fridge
now
but
this
heres
the
original
drinkability
is
good
except
for
the
price
i
payed
5
49
for
the
11
2oz
bottle
pouring
in
the
sediment
it
pours
an
extremecy
cloudy
brownyellow
colored

a
very
big

but
not
very
lasting
very
hoppy

full

not
watery
kind

some

dry
somewhat
acidic
kind
of
like
a
sweet
pale
ale
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
prickly
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
one
often
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
to
drink
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
belgian
sweetness
and
hops
i
dont
think
the
price
is
quite
justified
12
99
if
i
remember
correctly
houblon
chouffe
is
cheaper
and
better
and
gouden
carolus
hopsinjoor
is
nearly
as
good
and
is
9
at
most
still
a
very
good
beer
though
future
outlook
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
exactly
my
cup
of
meat
and
not
something
im
likely
to
revisit
anytime
soon
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
january
2012
so
i
guess
this
is
about
two
years
old
nice
hazy
yellow
billowy
head
smells
like
earthy
hops
and
tastes
like
a
nice
belgian
pale
very
easy
to
drink
but
when
i
think
of
hoppy
i
think
of
copious
amounts
of
american
hops
overall
i
liked
this
but
i
still
would
not
call
it
hoppy
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
id
have
this
again
for
sure
as
its
a
very
balanced
beer
and
very
tastey
but
at
4
99
for
a
11
2
oz
im
not
sure
i
will
be
back
for
another
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
was
of
honeyed
grain
lemon
and
very
floral
hops
the
taste
was
very
tart
during
the
middle
of
the
sip
but
finished
pretty
dry
i
probably
drank
this
during
the
wrong
time
of
the
year
because
this
beer
would
be
great
during
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
was
good
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
in
the
summer
d
very
drinkable
d
brewed
to
be
a
more
extreme
version
of
orval
xx
bitter
helps
set
the
bar
for
belgian
ipas
i
would
rather
have
orval
but
this
is
still
an
excellent
beer
i
could
drink
this
all

overall
impression
although
this
beer
wasnt
as
funky
as
id
typically
expect
from
a
belgian
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
would
be
a
fun
session
beer
if
i
could
afford
it
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
and
formed
a
huge
foamy
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
an
aroma
of
yeasts
medicinal
and
hops
the
flavor
was
of
hops
pepper
and
bread
the
body
was
medium
light
and
the
finish
bitter
yet
sprite
pours

clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
thin
foamy

that
settles

nice
balance
of

quaffable

and
light
crisp

you
ask

it
on

lemony

mintish
hops
all
abound
in
a
really
lovely
brew
mouthfeel
leaves
a
tiny
bit
to
be
desired
and
super

kind
of
puts
this
one
in
the
appertif

if
you

high
to
the
point

i

id
enjoy
it
more
after
a

of
letting

some
of

lovely

d
overall
a
very
good
bitter
belgian
though
would
be
hard
to
drink
in
multiples
d
its
a

bit
filling
but
still
great
ill
be
seeking
out
more
belgian
ipas
in
the
future
for
sure
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
disappointed
that
i
dont
have
any
left
to
enjoy
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
like
cobwebs
d
this
is
actually
quite
refreshing
and
at

is

different
but
excellent
overall
this
is
an
interesting

the
belgian
characteristics
were
not
really
there
but
the
ipa
flavors
were
enjoyed
on
tap
at
novare
res
in
portland
me
this
brew
was
a
hazy
yellow
gold
color
with
a
scant
but
bubbly
white
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
clove
with
wheat
breadiness
the
taste
is
crisp
rye
bread
and
lemony
sweetness
it
had
a
very
fine
carbonation
and
was
quite
drinkable
lively
in
feel
with
bitter
grass
hoppiness
pours
a
clouded
orange
brown
with
a
frothy
creme
head
nose
is
very
earthy
with
some
yeasty
funk
in
there
too
flavor
has
an
earthy
bitter
tone
i
cant
say
its
very
complex
but
its
definitely
robust
feel
has
a
fairly
full
carbonation
to
it
liquid
is
smooth
enough
this
is
quite
the
robust
belgian
ipa
distinct
because
of
its
rugged
earthiness

in

slightly
cloudy
with
a
small

smells
of

hoppy
the
malty
backbone
nicely
compliments
the
strong
hops
strong
yeasts
also
add
to
this
beers
intense
flavor
a
strong
bitter
with
above
average
carbonation
a
fine
showing
this
beer
was
so
much
better
than
i
had
expected
it
had
everything
that
you
would
expect
from
a
great
belgian
ale
with
a
significant
amount
of
hoppiness
where
i
had
this
i
usually
only
have
one
of
each
beer
so
that
i
can
try
a
variety
but
in
this
casei
had
to
have
a
second
xx
bitter
so
good
a
very
solid
beer
if
not
exactly
my
style
of
belgian
ipa
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
tmd
wow
very
hoppy
and
bitter
it
starts
off
a
bit
sweet
again
a
faint
reminder
of
a
triple
and
then
the
hops
kick
in
tsa
bit
oily
and
the
bitterness
lingers
on
it
is
a
nice
departure
from
what
i
normally
expect
from
my
belgian
friends
ill
definitelt
try
this
one
again
the
more
belgian
ipas
i
have
the
more
i
like
them
more
subtle
than
american
ipas
and
a
completely
different
flavor
profile
than
either
american
or
british
ipas
great
change
of
pace
and
highly
recommended
glowing
golden
color
under
a

the

a
delicate

just
as
it
does

this
was
a
treat
overall
this
is
a
very
very
smooth
beer
and
its
less
sweet
than
other
belgian
ipas
that
ive
had
definitely
worth
a
try
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
ontap
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
served
in
a
de
ranke
glass
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
very
nice
white
rocky
head
that
leaves
some
beautiful
lacing
smells
of
fairly
light
earthy
hops
with
some
decent
lingering
bitterness
but
not
a
hop
monster
the
taste
has
aa
beautiful
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
slightly
sweet
malt
up
front
that
segues
nicely
into
a
soft
creaminess
and
then
into
big
earthypiney
hop
flavors
with
a
long
pleasant
bitterness
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
delicious
this
is
particularly
good
on
tap
and
lacks
some
of
the
sharpness
of
the
bottled
version
and
seems
more
finely
balanced
while
preserving
the
earthy
bitterness
very
nice
d
fairly
easy
drinking
the
bitterness
really
cuts
down
on
the
drinkability
for
this
one
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
for
the
price
stick
to
the
mcchouffe
pours
a
bright
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
lingers
throughout
the
session
leaving
generous
lacing
the
smell
starts
with
the
lemon
and
floral
hops
but
is
fairly
sweet
with
belgian
yeast
and
some
sugar
in
the
background
there
are
definitely
some
spices
tickling
the
noses
as
well
the
taste
is
less
sweet
than
the
aroma
and
brings
more
bitterness
to
the
table
the
floral
hops
are
big
up
front
with
lemon
zest
and
some
grapefruit
and
the
belgian
yeast
and
sweetness
are
much
more
in
the
background
with
the
bitternes
lingering
through
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp
but
with
the
obvious
bitterness
and
lots
of
carbonation
this
is
decent
belgian
ipa
though
theres
nothing
really
differentiating
this
one
from
the
rest

comments
xx
bitter
is
a
fantastic
beer
in
the
bottle
when
i
passed
the
foreign
beers
bar
at
gbbf
this
year
and
i
saw
it
on
cask
i
just
had
to
try
it
it
certainly
has
some
interesting
elements
and
is
also
good
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
bottled
one
pours
a
nice
looking
golden
clear
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
moderate
lace
nose
is
a
bit
of
farm
funk
with
some
euro
hoppage
and
mucho
belgian
yeast
taste
follows
some
barn
spice
hops
and
belgian
yeast
and
a
touch
of
wheat
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
i
think
it
could
be
a
bit
thinner
drinkability
is
good
but
not
amazing
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
for
those
who
have
not
yet
been
exosed
to
it
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
brew
not
too
thin
decently
smooth
then
some
hoppy
tannic
texture
in
the
finish
prickly
carbonation
can
also
be
fluffy
pours
a
nice
cloudy
dark
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
white
creamy
head
with
lots
of
nice
thick
creamy
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
maltyhoppy
laundry
soap
with
some
yeast
tones
the
taste
is
maltyhoppy
yeasty
some
sourness
and
bitterness
medium
body
slightly
drybitter
drinkable
but
would
not
drink
again
different
though
definitely
recommended
this
is
one
of
the
weaker
belgian
goldens
ive
tried
and
it
shows
the
low
abv
means
that
there
isnt
that
slow
alcohol
burn
that
adds
another
layer
to
many
goldens
it
also
means
that
this
one
goes
down
smooth
as
hell
and
probably
isnt
as
dangerous
to
throw
back
in
quantity
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
mix
of
the
berkshire
steel
rail
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ever
and
something
like
a
duvel
possibly
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
im
definitely
enjoying
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
it
again
however
it
just
misses
the
cut
of
superelite
bevs
poured
from
a
capped
and
corked
750ml
bottle
best
by

2012
so
i
guess
this
was
a
young
buck

a
very
nice
dark
amber
with
billowy

that
leaves
nice

and
moderate
retention
smell
is
lite
hops
and

some
belgian

immediate
and
nice
hops
on
the
tongue
sweetness
in
middle
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
finish
lingers
and
is
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
a
joy
this
is
rich
buttery
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
another
great
offering
from
de
ranke
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
big
frothy
pure
white
head
that
disappeares
rather
quickly
with
little
lacing
smell
is
spicy
lots
of
hops
showing
up
yeast
and
breadiness
as
well
and
some
fruity
hints
taste
is
very
nice
bright
and
hoppy
with
citric
notes
unique
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
crisp
fullbodied
of
the
belgian
ipas
that
i
have
tasted
i
would
rank
this
one
of
the
best
excellent
drinkability
and
very
smooth
interesting
presentation
with
a
few
flaws
that
are
more
interesting
than
offputting
ive
only
had
this
brew
one
other
time
and
then
the
cork
was
shot
and
it
tasted
very
musky
this
time
i
am
very
impressed
although
i
wont
likely
buy
again
unless
i
am
brewing
a
belgian
style
ipadipa
too
pricey
for
my
every
day
enjoyment
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
mild
creamy
texture
from
the
persistent
head
this
is
a
good
one
for
hot
summer
nights
tastes
of
hops
german
types
yeasty
spice
fruit
and
lightly
acidic
this
is
one
interesting
and
delicious
beer
with
help
of
water
after
each
few
sips
this
is
pretty
drinkable
for
how
bitter
it
is
the
aspirinlike
taste
does
fade
a
bit
as
it
progresses
overall
it
is
reminiscent
of
campari
and
would
serve
well
as
an
aperitif
though
a
whole
750
is
a
bit
much
overall
a
delicious
and
unique
ale
a
must
try
for
those
love
belgians
with
hops
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
capped
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
beautiful
sudsy
white
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
phenols
and
candi
sugar
that
nice
tart
funk
earthy
saison
aroma
i
pick
up
some
banana
green
apple
corriander
white
pepper
and
a
light
grassy
hop
the
taste
definitely
has
more
of
a
hop
presence
some
grassy
hops
flavors
and
dare
i
say
a
slight
citrus
hop
the
hops
are
paired
with
a
nice
honey
malt
flowers
spices
and
belgian
candi
sugar
out
of
all
of
the
belgian
ipas
that
i
have
had
this
is
one
as
the
most
bitter
hop
profile
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
finishes
bitter
another
excellent
bipa
this
is
becoming
a
favorite
style
nice
combination
of
sweet
spice
and
bitter
had
on
tap
at
moan
and
dove
murky
cloudy
gold
appearance
with
a
nice
thick
head
and
eventual
patchy
lacing
strong
floral
hops
that
were
to
die
for
a
little
bit
thin
smelling
but
with
its
strength
it
helped
hinder
it
from
being
too
overpowering
bready
and
wheaty
to
the
max
it
was
so
deliciously
hoppy
and
wrapped
in
woody
forest
overtones
a
soild
medium
body
helps
explicit
the
taste
overall
really
really
good
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
mashup
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
one
thats
flavorful
and
interesting
and
refreshing
i
do
wish
some
of
the
belgian
fruitiness
came
through
more
but
it
comes
through
enough
to
set
it
apart
from
your
average
ipa
d
drinkability
is
good
balance
of
flavors
is
good
for
the
style
alcohol
is
low
which
lets
the
other
flavors
show
some
character
very
nice
overall
i
would
pick
this
one
up
agian
very
well
balanced
and
extremely
delishous
cant
wait
to
pick
up
some
more
d
a
very
unique
and
excellent
beer
i
enjoyed
it
i
have
noticed
that
the
bottle
reviews
are
scoring
much
higher
than
the
tap
reviews
i
am
going
to
have
to
find
a
bottle
of
this
somewhere
and
do
some
comparing
xx
poured
a
hazy
lemon
with
some
orange
highlights
blended
into
it
on
top
of
this
beer
was
a
1
finger
head
of
white
foam
that
had
great
retention
that
left
behind
a
small
white
film
and
a
fair
amount
of
white
streaks
of
lace
the
aroma
was
truly
unique
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
dry
with
spicy
citrus
hops
a
drop
of
perfume
brett
yeast
a
slice
of
lemon
a
pinch
of
grapefruit
and
then
it
ended
with
an
aroma
that
smelled
like
hay
or
something
you
would
smell
on
a
farm
i
read
a
brief
description
of
the
beer
and
they
said
it
was
going
to
be
very
hoppy
instead
it
wasnt
overly
hoppy
but
it
still
had
a
nice
high
level
of
hops
to
it
it
started
off
lightly
hopped
and
as
it
progressed
it
got
hoppier
but
it
ended
with
a
mildly
aggressive
hoppiness
besides
all
the
hops
in
here
there
was
also
citrus
fruits
citrus
hops
grapefruit
brett
yeast
lightly
toasted
malts
a
dab
of
lemon
and
a
slight
touch
of
hay
it
was
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
light
dry
hoppy
aftertaste
of
citrus
fruits
citrus
hops
and
a
touch
of
yeast
overall
a
nice
not
overly
hopped
belgian
beer
it
is
hoppy
for
a
belgain
beer
but
compared
to
what
the
americans
can
dish
out
its
mild
update
i
had
a
chance
to
pop
another
bottle
in
early
2011
it
really
is
an
incredible
beer
full
of
life
with
a
unique
hop
flavor
for
firm
for
the
style
and
a
terrific
drinker
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
chalice
yellow
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
vaguely
fruity
with
some
hops
and
malt
present
flavor
is
a
little
odd
initially
it
tastes
like
a
typical
belgian
ale
with
spices
but
then
resiny
and
floral
hops
kick
in
and
overpower
the
other
flavors
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
im
not
entirely
sure
what
to
think
about
this
beer
i
like
the
two
flavor
profiles
by
themselves
but
mixed
together
it
doesnt
work
well
on
my
palate
verdict
an
interesting
take
on
an
ipa
i
wouldnt
classify
it
as
such
and
its
more
of
a
belgian
xpa
to
me
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
glad
i
finally
did
the
bitterness
is
very
nice
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
remind
me
orval
a
lesson
in
terms
of
bitterness
rich
malt
up
front
is
immediately
balanced
out
by
an
herbalearthy
hop
character
toasted
grain
blends
in
with
the
finish
there
is
a
very
pleasing
rind
type
bitterness
that
sits
on
the
tongue
and
melds
so
well
with
any
lingering
sweetness
from
the
malt
great
carbonation
and
a
light
to
medium
body
im
almost
done
with
this
and
its
only
been
about
5
minutes
should
have
bought
a
case
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
maybe
my
absolute
favorite
750
ml
bottle
head
is
just
soso
and
the
brew
itself
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
but
things
get
bitter
with
the
aroma
being
a
combination
of
citrusy
hops
american
hops
and
belgian
yeast
taste
was
in
line
with
the
aroma
being
a
hybrid
between
two
styles
it
might
be
the
bitterest
beer
in
belgium
but
compared
to
real
ipas
its
not
so
bitter
at
all
best
to
let
it
warm
up
to
near
room
temperature
lest
it
be
far
too
dry
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light

it

bitter
this
is
my
alltime
favourite
belgian
answer
to
a
hoppy
bitter
a
marvellous
drink
highly
recommended
this
is
what
a
belgian
ipa
should
be
try
this
with
some
spicy
spiced
that
is
not
habanero
spicy
cheese
nice
pairing
of
course
this
also
stands
on
its
own
just
fine
d
this
is
a
nice
and
fresh
and
certainly
very
bitter
take
on
a
belgian
ipa
personally
i
think
i
enjoy
piraats
version
better
but
the
two
seem
almost
like
completly
different
styles
the
piraat
tasting
much
sweeter
and
this
one
a
great
deal
more
bitter
but
really
this
is
a
very
nice
representation
of
belgian
style
by
far
the
hoppiest
beer
ive
had
from
belgium
yet
its
fairly
easy
drinking
an
11
2
ounce
bottle
wasnt
enough
for
me
next
time
im
going
for
the
corked
750
ml
bottle
not
a
bad
beer
but
inferior
in
style
to
hopit
in
my
opinion
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
goldenyellow
with
a
big
frothy
pure
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves
fabulous

taste
is
very
nice

hoppy
with
lots
of

leafy
notes
alongside
cloves
and

its
unique
and
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
crisp
well
carbonated
and
full
of
body
and
drinkability
is
excellent
topdrawer
beer
d
one
of
the
few
belgian
ipas
i
have
ever
had
one
of
the
most
idiosyncratic
flavours
i
have
ever
had
in
a
beer
a
nice
experiment
but
i
dont
know
if
ill
have
it
again
very
pricey
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
by
blending
the
complex
yeasty
fruit
character
of
a
belgian
ale
and
the
bone
dry
body
of
a
good
ipa
this
superb
hybrid
truly
delivers
served
on
tap
in
a
large
unibroue
tulip
at
brasserie
v
in
madison
wi
appearance
is
a
bit
disappointing
on
tap
as
there
is
no
head
this
is
partially
the
result
of
an
overly
generous
and
poorly
executed
pour
but
still
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
of
lace
at
least
i
dont
recall
having
this
problem
when
ive
consumed
it
out
of
the
bottle
body
is
light
orange
and
clear
aroma
is
clean
and
spicy
with
hints
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
and
touches
of
fruity
yeast
taste
contains
a
pale
malt
backbone
but
that
is
just
an
afterthought
hops
dominate
this
beer
sharp
citric
flavors
and
feel
hit
the
front
of
the
palate
while
dry
spicy
notes
pound
the
back
all
the
while
a
generic
fruity
think
cotton
candy
yeast
flavor
balances
and
rounds
everything
out
the
superb
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
fun
to
drink
and
the
peppery
dry
finish
makes
it
easy
a
great
beer
d
i
only
bought
one
bottle
but
i
will
seek
out
more
as
this
beer
is
unique
in
my
experience
dmeh
this
just
doesnt
quite
meld
like
the
piraat
a
good
beer
to
try
i
suppose
d
quite
an
interesting
beer
the
overall
impression
is
of
a
german
style
pilsner
but
this
beer
is
much
more
complex
than
a
pils
some
of
the
flavors
are
very
surprising
considering
the
beers
color
this
is
not
a
sessionable
easy
drinking
beer
but
under
the
right
circumstances
it
could
be
spectacular
perhaps
with
a
cigar
drinkability
high
d
this
beer
has
nice
big
hops
that
are
not
american
in
flavor
supported
by
some
nice
belgian
yeast
notes
the
crazy
head
kept
me
mesmerized
while
drinking
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
stick
with
but
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
slightly
hazed
golden
colour
with
a
bright
white
head
that
settled
quickly
to
a
short
cap
the
fine
bubbles
formed
solid
sheets
of
lace
on
my
glass
very
hoppy
aroma
earthy
floral
perfumy
woody
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
fruit
character
bitterness
was
very
strong
and
lasted
through
the
finish
it
had
a
sweettart
fruitiness
and
a
mild
malt
presence
hops
were
earthy
and
then
spicy
in
the
finish
light
bodied
with
considerable
carbonation
that
gave
it
an
airy
texture
slightly
soapy
yet
still
with
some
dryness
quite
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
but
too
bitter
to
really
throw
back
to
many
of
them
even
one
started
to
really
build
up
on
my
tongue
by
the
end
i
still
prefer
the
chouffe
houblon
wow
very
impressed
fro
the
hoppiest
beer
of
belgium
not
strong
like
an
american
ipa
creamy
head
very
light
and
crisp
which
makes
it
a
great
summer
beer
and
something
that
you
can
drink
over
and
over
again
it
is
not
bitter
like
the
name
of
it
might
suggest
not
as
carbonated
as
some
bottle
conditioned
belgians
this
one
is
a
very
nice
hoppy
import
recommended
for
all
to
try
with
this
low
of
an
abv
it
is
truly
worthy
of
being
a
session
beer
must
have
more
this
750
will
be
gone
sooner
than
i
wish
a
classic
i
gave
this
beer
the
highest
score
because
i
am
a
combination
belgian
beer
and
hop
lover
this
combines
the
best
of
both
worlds
a
solidly
bitter
beer
unlike
the
appelation
given
to
the
british
style
with
belgian
ancestry
nino
explained
to
me
that
he
wanted
to
start
a
brewery
that
brought
belgain
beer
back
to
its
roots
hoppy
and
dry
over
the
years
with
the
conglomeration
of
breweries
in
the
world
and
in
belgium
many
beers
have
lost
their
character
and
it
has
been
replaced
with
a
sickly
sweet
one
nino
hand
picks
his
hops
and
a
larger
quanity
is
added
to
the
kettle
than
you
could
imagine
but
because
the
hops
are
lowalpha
european
varieties
the
effect
is
something
completely
unlike
the
superhopped
american
styles
if
you
havent
already
tried
this
award
winner
you
are
seriously
missing
out
the
mouthfeel
was
impressive
light
body
but
huge
profile
the
hops
i
mentioned
which
dries
right
up
however
i
let
my
buddies
finish
this
bottle
up
while
i
moved
onto
a
sixpoint
growler
as
i
found
it
way
too
unbalanced
disappointment
belgian
pale
ales
and
ipas
are
both
some
of
the
most
drinkable
styles
around
and
so
it
makes
sense
that
a
hybrid
of
the
two
would
be
just
as
drinkable
and
it
is
had
this
at
the
hopleaf
served
in
a
small
tumblertype
glass
poured
a
very
hazy
orangelight
amber
nice
creamy
tight
head
and
lacing
aroma
was
phenomenal
i
swear
it
was
dominated
by
apricots
also
some
vegetal
grassy
aromas
as
it
opened
up
along
with
some
doughymalty
notes
a
bit
of
bready
sweetness
upfront
is
quickly
followed
by
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
a
touch
less
ibus
than
a
big
american
ipa
finish
is
long
and
complex
and
mouthfeel
is
medium
nice
carbonation
in
this
one
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
4s
across
the
board
what
can
i
say
no
deficiencies
to
speak
of
and
its
a
nice
blend
of
styles
recommended
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
big
fat
longlasting
white
head
on
top
and
gorgeous
sparkling
lace
down
the
glass
smell
is
grassy
floral
spicy
and
lemony
very
noblehopppy
with
nice
bready
malts
and
faint
yeastyfunkiness
taste
is
fantastic
following
suit
from
the
smell
but
with
more
sweetness
from
the
pale
malt
and
surprisingly
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
slave
to
the
champagnelike
carbonation
but
as
a
celebration
drink
this
beer
is
fantastic
highly
recommended
if
not
a
bit
pricey
d
a
hoppy
and
bitter
beer
thats
not
ridiculously
over
hopped
awesome
though
i
could
live
with
out
that
lemon
flavor
id
pass
on
another
for
now
but
i
can
see
this
brew
and
me
in
the
future
for
what
it
is
it
sees
and
raises
the
ante
on
us
ipas
very
balanced
and
tasty
exceptional
drinkability
if
it
were
a
750ml
bottle
it
would
disappear
just
as
fast
this
is
a
bit
dry
for
my
taste
but
i
think
that
is
true
to
the
style
the
bitterness
is
just
not
the
kind
is
was
hoping
for
it
is
not
balanced
by
any
real
malty
body
or
alcohol
taste
at
13
for
a
bottle
i
will
probably
never
buy
this
again
although
i
will
certainly
finish
this
one
pours
a
hazed
gold
with
a
big
bubbly
head
at
first
but
then
subsides
head
clings
a
bit
to
the
glass
on
the
sips
but
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
to
speak
of
but
some
scattered
spots
some
sweet
pale
malts
up
front
in
the
nose
and
some
mild
esters
pretty
clean
for
a
belgian
hops
take
on
an
herbal
and
floral
presence
in
the
flavor
a
malty
sweetness
is
presented
at
first
which
is
then
followed
by
herbal
and
grassy
hops
i
somehow
get
a
flavor
of
caraway
in
the
middle
what
follows
the
hop
flavors
is
a
bitterness
that
lingers
on
past
the
finish
while
bready
and
nutty
malts
come
to
the
forefront
in
the
aftertaste
overall
hop
character
in
this
hoppy
belgian
reminds
me
of
an
assertive
pils
body
is
pretty
lightweight
with
a
carbonation
that
tingles
the
tongue
which
i
think
is
right
on
considering
what
this
is
going
for
in
the
flavor
profile
11
2
oz
is
not
enough
of
this
if
you
cant
decide
between
having
a
belgian
pale
or
an
ipa
this
could
fill
both
cravings
certainly
worth
checking
out
this
beer
is
very
hoppy
and
dry
compared
to
most
other
belgian
ales
hence
the
name
right
interesting
layered
and
complex
though
subtle
and
not
overpowering
very
light
and
refreshing
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
there
were
adjuncts
dont
get
me
wrong
because
i
really
like
it
tiny
bubbles
like
a
champagne
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
if
i
lived
in
belgium
i
might
drink
this
like
i
drink
big
daddy
ipa
now
cheers

freshness
date
clearly
printed
on
the
paper
which
tells
me
that
the
beer
will
be
good
until
may
2011
that
means
it
was
bottled
may
2006
enjoyed
in
large
bulbous
wine
glasses
pours
a
beautiful
golden
straw
color
with
a
bit
of
cloudiness
as
some
yeast
sediment
spilled
into
the
glass
big
fluffy
white
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
well
guess
what
it
smells
like
hops
wow
big
strong
hop
aroma
here
fresh
grassy
slightly
piny
hops
with
hints
of
that
fruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
medium
bodied
with
refreshing
tiny
bubbled
carbonation
starts
out
with
those
fruity
flavors
im
getting
a
little
bit
of
banana
and
tart
apples
just
a
little
though
that
is
followed
by
the
super
crisp
hop
flavors
not
resinous
like
american
ipas
but
clean
and
dry
with
a
strong
bitter
finish
oh
and
underneath
it
all
is
a
subtle
dry
biscuity
malt
flavor
this
has
possibly
the
most
enjoyable
bitterness
ive
ever
had
my
only
gripe
with
this
beer
is
that
i
dont
find
it
very
drinkable
due
to
its
strong
bitterness
the
more
i
drank
the
more
the
bitterness
seemed
to
numb
my
palate
to
the
other
flavors
other
than
that
this
stuff
is
just
amazing
and
hard
to
believe
that
it
comes
from
belgium
really
good
and
completely
original
and
interesting
basically
if
you
dont
like
hops
obviously
the
hoppiest
beer
in
belgium
isnt
probably
something
you
would
be
interested
in
trying
in
the
first
place
so
assuming
you
do
this
is
a
gem
for
sure
it
has
the
usual
golden
ale
characteristics
with
a
supercharged
hop
makeup
definitely
worth
a
shot
or
two
or
ten
the
bitterness
is
the
selling
point
and
a
true
strength
but
its
the
busy
organizedfrenzy
blend
that
makes
this
so
refreshing
and
enjoyable
its
so
clean
that
each
sip
asks
for
another
making
it
gladly
drinkable
if
you
like
its
traits
its
pretty
involved
and
worth
the
measure
of
attention
it
demands
ive
been
working
my
way
through
the
belgian
ipa
offerings
and
this
beer
has
been
on
my
radar
for
quite
some
time
this
is
a
unique
treat
that
really
sets
the
benchmark
high
for
hoppy
belgian
beers
this
belgian
ipa
poured
a
hazy
light
amber
color
with
strong
fine
carbonation
and
fluffy
offwhite
stiff
meringuelike
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
strong
aromatic
noble
hops
very
nice
the
taste
was
dominated
by
the
hops
strong
bitter
and
floral
hoppiness
this
was
combined
with
a
nice
dry
maltiness
a
wonderful
marriage
of
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
with
medium
body
and
strong
carbonation
it
had
a
light
airy
feel
on
the
tongue
the
hop
flavors
lingered
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
d
tasty
hops
and
nice
complexity
coupled
with
6
2
abv
make
the
drinkability
good
on
this
one
if
you
get
a
good
bottle
my
experience
with
this
beer
has
been
hit
or
miss
to
say
the
least
both
in
bottles
and
on
draft
ive
had
bottles
of
this
from
the
same
case
that
have
been
very
good
like
this
one
to
almost
drain
pour
the
whole
bottle
tasted
like
mouthfull
after
mouthfull
of
dirt
i
had
it
on
draft
at
map
room
once
and
it
also
tasted
like
dirt
strange
this
beer
is
incredibly
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
wish
i
could
afford
a
few
hundred
bottles
of
it
it
would
make
for
many
great
food
pairings
and
enjoyable
moments
a
classic
mouthfeedrinkabiity
as
i
said
above
at
first
this
was
a
bit
harsh
with
the
carbonation
but
that
settled
down
to
become
pretty
smooth
with
medium
body
the
drinkability
ends
up
pretty
very
good
on
this
one
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
an
orval
glass
the
head
is
big
carbonation
and
white
the
color
is
a
murky
orange
much
like
a
julius
etcher
hefe
unfiltered
but
no
big
particals
floating
around
the
taste
is
a
clean
bitterness
that
is
the
hoppist
belgian
beer
is
maybe
true
there
is
a
rawness
in
the
body
and
flavor
that
is
sweet
smooth
texture
the
flavors
are
the
hops
and
the
yeast
variety
the
body
is
medium
and
i
finished
the
bottle
myself
and
thats
all
i
need
in
a
sitting
of
this
brew
drinks
fairly
easy
says
its
the
hoppiest
ale
in
belgium
to
my
knowledge
they
might
be
right
granted
they
cheated
by
going
low
on
the
abv
6

profile
by
belgian
standards
i
liked
this
wished
it
wasnt
so
expensive

a
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
orangish
yellow
under
a
slightly
offwhite
two
finger
head
that
fades
quite
slowly
but
doesnt
leave
much
in
the
way
of
lace
the
nose
is
very
floral
reminiscent
of
carnations
with
a
bit
of
spice
the
mouth
is
surprisingly
light
and
very
prickly
the
taste
opens
with
a
more
traditional
francophone
fruitiness
with
hints
of
coriander
and
cassis
the
hops
kick
in
fairly
quickly
though
overwhelming
the
fruit
and
turning
the
lighter
spices
into
a
pretty
sharp
espresso
bitter
the
hops
are
not
overpowering
by
any
means
but
they
are
insistent
into
the
finish
then
fade
fairly
quickly
in
the
aftertaste
leaving
just
a
faint
memory
of
their
bitterness
an
interesting
hybrid
of
traditional
belgian
and
new
age
hoppiness
i
like
it
what
a
wonderful
beer
just
had
to
get
that
out
of
the
way
before
i
started
750
ml
corked
crowned
and
wrapped
in
paper
very
elegant
presentation
the
wrapping
tells
me
that
is
it
best
before
june
2010
making
june
05
the
bottling
date
and
the
label
mistakenly
identifies
the
bottle
as
11
2
oz
it
pours
a
bright
unfiltered
yellowgold
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
beautiful
fluffy
four
finger
bonewhite
head
that
leaves
big
clumps
of
lace
on
my
tulip
subsequent
pours
make
the
beer
more
and
more
transluscent
the
aroma
has
noble
hops
aplenty
with
oily
soapy
grassy
and
spicy
notes
along
with
some
medicinal
phenols
on
the
palate
it
is
a
showcase
of
spicy
floral
perfumy
piney
and
grassy
hops
with
clean
pale
malts
in
the
back
giving
only
enough
flavor
to
balance
the
medium
bitterness
in
addition
there
are
phenols
and
notes
of
green
apple
melon
rind
and
yeast
on
top
of
a
medium
body
that
retains
medium
carbonation
all
the
way
through
leaving
a
medium
to
long
finish
i
really
like
the
way
they
hopped
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
wellcrafted
pilsner
but
so
much
better
there
is
a
huge
hop
presence
but
the
bitterness
is
wellcalibrated
and
although
it
is
heady
its
light
enough
in
alcohol
to
make
it
a
session
beer
amazing
to
say
the
least
the
only
downside
is
the
price
tag
13
but
im
willing
to
splurge
on
this
beauty
at
least
once
more
this
poured
a
golden
straw
color
thats
very
clear
many
columns
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
a
1
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
fruitiness
floral
and
slight
spicy
noble
hop
saaz
like
presence
the
taste
seems
to
have
the
same
citrus
floral
and
spice
hop
flavors
melded
with
a
nice
pale
belgian
malt
profile
the
malt
adds
nice
sweetness
that
tries
to
balance
out
the
hops
but
it
fails
to
do
this
perfectly
theres
isnt
a
overpowering
belgian
yeast
flavor
and
thats
good
light
bubbly
carbonation
in
the
mouth
and
it
finishes
nice
and
dry
this
is
low
in
alcohol
great
tasting
and
has
a
crisp
refreshing
quality
to
it
well
done
this
isnt
as
much
like
orval
as
i
was
anticipating
its
paler
less
funky
and
has
a
very
different
mouthfeel
that
is
irrelavant
though
because
its
still
a
damn
good
beer

color
with
a

white

there
is
a
lot
of
yeast
on

and
i
found
that
it
just
intensifies
the

when
included
in
the

beautiful

i

digging
the

it

that
finishes
dry

spicy
not
much
in
the
malt
department
but
that
is
not
what
this
beer
is
about
overall
this
instantly
climbs
the
ranks
as
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
simply
a
superbly
crafted
brew
the
yeast
pour
thickens
the
beer
but
doesnt
do
much
to
lower
the
hop
bite
drinkability
wonderful
belgian
pale
ale
that
can
almost
be
considered
a
session
beer
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable

the
tastebuds
a
very
good
brew

the

its

then
after

i
just
realized
it
was
more

than
i
am
accustomed
to
for
the
style
not
sweet
like
a
blegian

more
bitter
like

packing

id
call
it
an
artful
rendering
of
hoppy

the
hops
are
there
i
tell
ya
they
know
how
to
brew
beer
in
belgium
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
at
redbones
and
now
i
am
wondering
what
took
me
so
long
anyway
nice
cloudy
yellow
when
poured
no
head
but
a
nice

aroma
taste
was
a
mix
of
a
sweet
start
finishing
with
a
bowl
of
grapefurit
at
the
end
there
was
some
bitterness
but
its
so
refined
would
get
again
and
think
i
could
sneak
this
in
under
the

maybe

at

fest
i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
this
is
a
cloudy
yellow
brew
w
a
nice
bitter
taste
very
full
mouthfeel
its
quite
drinakable
its
a
nice
palate
cleaner
which
is
quite
usefull
during
a
day
of
beer
tasting
the
hoppiest
beer
of
belgium
according
to
the
bottle
i
dont
think
so
bottle
conditioned
and
a
careful
pour
managed
to
leave
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
resulting
in
a
golden
yellow
decant
a
little
sweet
and
dense
no
more
than
average
for
the
style
hops
bittering
seemed
no
more
pronounced
than
the
average
belgian
golden
or
pale
ale
moderate
yeast
phenol
flavors
with
a
slightly
off
finish
overall
my
experience
was
neither
particularly
good
nor
bad
a
hop
heavy
belgian
ale
life
is
good
and
this
sure
helps
the
pour
was
perfect
massive
blocky
head
formed
over
a
clear
golden
brew
and
remained
clinging
in
clumps
to
the
side
of
my
gass
and
floating
on
top
steady
streams
of
carbonation
release
strong
citrus
and
damp
straw
aromas
with
yeast
notes
and
some
astringent
phenols
initial
sip
is
light
and
slightly
metalic
but
then
hop
flavors
of
resinous
pine
and
lemongrass
kick
in
tastes
and
smells
like
a
blend
of
german
and
british
hops
malt
richness
fights
to
make
this
a
fuller
bodied
beer
but
loses
its
battle
with
the

at

the

people
must
have
been
reading
my

a
caliginous
orange
color
the
head
massive
in
size
and
the
consistency
frothy
with
fine
sheets
of

smother
the

the
aroma
plums

and
a
bit
sour
or
tart
if
you
like
winish
also
slightly
floral
the
start
is
mildly
sweet
the
top
skimpy

purposeful
in
its
acidity
the
hops
masterful
in
their
spicy
bite
and
the
aftertaste

the

allow

eek
into
the

is
unique

if
you
cant
choose
between
assertively

and
a

you
can
have
your
cake
and
eat
it

this
brew
delectably
bitter

not

the

that
starts
out

shifts
gears
to
a

unique

quite

floral
nose
hazy

colour
kind
of
like

very
very
dry
herby
slightly
spicy
and
bitter
on
the
palate
i
thought
it
was
quite
interesting
and
quite
unique
and
i
like
my
beers
on
the
drier
side
a
great
little
find

14
inch

after
40
seconds
or
so
very
aromatic
in

and
hop
zazz
wow
this
stuff
is
bitter
lots
of
hops
in
the
middle
and
back
of
the
tongue
other
notes
are
definitely
of
citrus
rinds
and
a
little
sweetness
in
the
attenuated
finish
good
but
not
excessive
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
something
different
and
something
not
as
vinous
its
a
tad
plastickly
phenolic
as
many
belgian
styles
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
in
that
despite
its
yeast
and
old
world
hops
its
a
lot
like
a
brewpub
super
ipa
nice
small
batch
brew
but
not
sure
if
it
was
worth
10
a
bottle
how
is
this
not
a
witbier
good
taste
but
the
finish
was
a
little
blandempty
easy
drinking
lacking
a
big
flavor
punch
and
is
just
middle
of
the
road
nice
color
and
head
aroma
is
very
nice
and
refreshing
with
hints
of
citrus
and
a
little
spice
flavor
is
the
same
with
an
ever
so
slight
orange
bitterness
and
a
little
spice
and
hop
flavor
blends
nicely
together
good
carbonation
clean
very
very
light
finish
refreshing
o
needs
some
more
hops
is
they
want
to
stamp
ipa
on
the
side
of
their
can
hazy
golden
hued
with
almost
an
orange
like
tint
brussels
lacing
a
thin
layer
of
white
foam
mostly
covers
the
top
of
the
beer
hints
of
coriander
and
a
stronger
smell
of
citrus
hops
is
what
i
get
out
of
the
aroma
the
body
is
lightfairly
crisp
and
refreshing
the
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
hops
and
some
gently
added
coriander
this
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
refreshing
a
straw
colored
crisp
ipa
with
a
modicum
of
sweetness
and
a
nice
balance
between
citrus
bitterness
and
tangy
belgian
notes
id
say
this
is
more
of
a
highly
hopped
wit
or
white
ipa
than
strictly
belgian
ipa
very
clean
and
mostly
dry
and
refreshing
overall
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
a
can
is
great
for
summer
activities
in
fact
this
was
one
of
my
goto
beers
over
this
last
summer
hits
just
the
right
notes
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
not
being
too
light
or
bland
a
well
made
beer
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
lot
i
am
not
a
real
hop
head

this
beer
was
in
the

room
at

i
am
a

salesman
it
smells
great
taste
is
really
good
i
am
guessing
the
ibu
are
around
75
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
will
be
looking
for
more
of
this
in
the
breakage
room
i
love
being
a
beer
salesman
overall
i
love
some
white
ipas
they
take
the
best
aspect
of
a
witbier
and
hop
it

to
really
add

great

of
nicely
robust
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
the
flavor
of
this
belgian
ipa
is
more
on
the
wit
side
than
ipa
which
is
decent
with
some
subtle
pepper
and
lemony
notes
which
seem
hop
initiated
but
there
is
a
mild
wheat
element
which
seems
to
slightly
dampen
the
hop
bitterness
and
bring
a
more
toasted
wheat
taste
to
the
forefront
the
hops
and
spices
combine
to
add
a
mild
soapiness
which
is
not
offensive
but
doesnt
enhance
the
flavor
overall
a
good
wheat
but
less
of
an
ipa
which
seems
to
be
the
case
when
you
hybridize
a
wit
and
ipa
one
style
has
to
take
precedence
i
dislike
the
name
ipa
because
you
expect
a
lot
more
hops
a
case
of
marketing
over
flavor
i
suppose
overall
very
good
brew
would
buy
it
again
in
a
heart
beat
i
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
will
salud
a
cloudy
yellow
gold
color
with
a
very
healthy
white
foam
on
top
and
luscious
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
pleasant
vinegar
citrus
kind
of
a
neat
skunky
hop
the
flavor
comes
on
with
an
oaky
citrus
bite
and
yeasty
lemon
bread
its
got
a
light
body
but
offers
a
smooth
well
carbonated
feel
a
tasty
easy
hop
drinker
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
well
worth
trying
one
of
the
best
white
ipas
ive
had
so
far
picked
up
a
6pack
at
euromarket
the
cans
were
stamped
july
but
the
beer
tastes
plenty
fresh
this
is
a
lighterbodied
ipa
with
a
lot
of
the
same
earthy
spice
youre
used
to
in
other
belgian
ipas
the
hops
bring
a
juicy
mix
of
apricot
tangerine
and
mild
pine
mmmm
a
mighty
fine
pale
ale
heredrinkable
and
satisfying
i
found
this
beer
to
be
really
interesting
initially
but
its
one
of
those
that
dissipates
quickly
and
becomes
less
interesting
not
more
as
it
opens
up
a
bit
something
about
the
flavor
in
particular
is
a
bit
shallow
although
the
yeastiness
lingers
on
a
bit
more
so
than
the
hops
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
canned
ipa
unique
and
very
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
make
a
priority
to
try
or
buy
again
a
very
refreshing
ale
very
tasty
and
as
far
as
the
brewerys
releases
go
this
is
one
of
their
best
nice
hazy
gold
with
a
nice
head
and
good
retention
some
lace
on
the
sides
and
some
light
carbonation
to
go
with
a
thin
covering
smell
is
is
quite
full
of
pine
and
a
belgian
yeast
doughiness
with
some
big
sweet
dinner
rolls
a
touch
of
pepper
and
citrus
taste
has
a
malt
body
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
tripel
with
a
nice
pine
hoppiness
on
top
sweet
pearl
and
crystal
malt
with
a
healthy
wheat
component
makes
this
super
easy
on
the
tongue
nice
compliment
of
belgian
spice
in
the
mix
clean
dry
hoppy
finish
with
a
touch
of
hop
oil
lingering
feel
is
crisp
and
dry
with
a
lovely
quenching
character
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
weight
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
giving
this
brew
high
sessionability
an
artful
interpretation
of
the
style
and
i
will
be
looking
for
this
one
near
me
great
brew
to
have
around
the
house
much
love
to
my
good
friend
harry
smith
for
bringing
me
a
few
cans
of
this
good
stuff
o
a
great
melding
of
citrusy
ipa
and
yeasty
spicy
belgian
easy
to
drink
hence
the
choice
of
a
can
container
making
it
possible
to
down
a
sixer
in
one
sitting
but
still
flavorful
enough
to
know
youre
drinking
a
bipa
o
light
and
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
nice
hot
weather
beer
and
is
very
sessionable
d
it
is
described
as
a
belgian
ipa
but
i
get
the
impression
is
might
be
intended
to
be
something
more
like
an
ipawit
hybrid
the
hops
work
relatively
well
though
they
arent
as
strong
as
i
would
like
them
to
be
but
the
yeast
is
where
everything
falls
apart
the
is
just
too
much
clove
and
a
flat
malt
flavor
with
grainy
notes
not
something
i
would
drink
again
overall
had
higher
expectations
after
the
aroma
the
beer
isnt
bad
just
has
a
lot
of
the
musty
dry
soda
flavor
i
will
say
that
for
the
white
ipas
out
there
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
what
a
hop
bomb
the
hops
were
exploding
everywhere
i
thought
the
choice
of
herbal
spicy
hops
complimented
the
peppery
yeast
notes
the
only
real
downside
to
this
beer
is
palate
fatigue
the
hops
are
intense
and
they
will
quickly
mess
with
your
taste
buds
even
so
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
the
crack
and
inverted
glug
came
off
without
a
hitch
and
i
was
off
and
running
the
thick
dense
massive
head
had
an
odd
shade
to
it
slightly
yellow
but
not
enough
to
qualify
it
as
many
shades
of
white
to
which
i
usually
allude
lets
call
it
eggshell
white
with
great
retention
and
move
on
color
was
an
ohsoslightlyhazy
goldenyellow
the
nose
had
a
peppery
spiciness
to
it
and
following
my
last
such
beer
i
literally
began
to
sneeze
i
was
glad
that
this
one
was
to
be
tonights
finale
as
i
am
getting
my
fill
in
this
case
it
was
more
the
spice
than
the
yeast
driving
everything
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
while
it
had
a
definite
spicy
bite
on
the
tongue
i
did
not
sense
it
in
the
same
way
as
the
coriander
of
the
previous
beer
was
my
palate
becoming
desensitized
did
they
use
less
coriander
than
upslope
i
do
not
know
but
this
was
more
baby
bearstyle
in
my
estimation
just
right
as
opposed
to
papa
bearstyle
too
much
in
the
upslope
or
i
could
be
misidentifying
the
spice
in
this
altogether
no
matter
i
was
really
enjoying
this
one
and
when
the
spice
coupled
with
the
hops
i
was
in
ecstasy
to
say
that
this
was
dry
would
be
to
do
it
an
injustice
this
was
the
zephyr
winds
blowing
across
the
sahara
desert
dry
and
i
was
all
for
it
i
am
not
sure
how
it
would
be
at
the
beach
but
on
hula
in
the
coola
day
01
feb
annually
it
would
be
fantastic
o
ambitious
effort
by
a
solid
brewery
it
will
not
change
my
world
however
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
insanely
robust
super
complex
nose
there
was
huge
fruit
fresh
juicy
hops
bold
plastics
and
bright
clovey
phenols
the
flavoring
was
almost
as
robust
with
equally
as
deep
complexity
this
is
not
an
everyday
beer
but
it
was
great
for
the
style
if
we
had
one
complaint
it
is
the
look
as
we
always
like
to
see
that
massive
belgian
ipa
head
of
foam
which
was
sadly
absent
here
o
really
enjoyed
getting
a
draft
of
thus
it
was
a
perfect
thirst
quencher
after
a
long
day
odwas
expecting
a
bit
more
muscularity
with
the
hops
this
beer
is
complex
and
unique
but
balanced
between
all
the
beers
aspects
a
nice
take
on
the
white
ipa
not
a
bad
price
tag
either
a
thanks
goes
out
to
woodychandler
for
keeping
me
in
canned
beers
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
citrus
hops
and
spice
taste
is
the
same
citrus
and
spices
hoppy
and
bitter
a
touch
of
malts
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
well
done
o
this
is
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
this
beer
would
taste
like
nothing
too
over
the
top
but
a
very
solid
beer
this
and
the
toasted
lager
are
the
two
first
beers
bluepoint
canned
and
i
cannot
wait
to
find
this
in
a
can
as
i
think
it
will
taste
much
better
than
it
already
does
o
a
good
tasting
refreshing
beer
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
makes
for
a
good
selection
if
you
cant
decide
on
an
ipa
or
something
lighter
im
not
sure
what
makes
it
a
white
ipa
i
suppose
i
have
some
research
to
do
however
this
was
a
wonderful
complex
beer
that
would
be
great
in
the
summer
or
really
anytime
this
beer
really
lets
you
appreciate
the
hops
as
an
ipa
should
but
balancing
that
with
the
yeast
my
favorite
belgian
ipa
i
hope
this
becomes
a
yearround
offering
overall
a
very
nice
hop
forward
example
of
the
style
on
tap
at
the
mellow
in
greensboro
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
peachlike
color
with
a
12
finger
white
head
atop
fresh
floral
hop
aromas
with
some
citric
edge
as
wellmild
spice
wich
was
more
pronounced
on
the
palate
spiced
notes
along
with
citric
hop
flavorsthe
spice
might
be
a
bit
much
but
its
still
got
a
good
hop
profile
i
really
like
the
aromas
of
this
beer
and
the
big
use
of
american
hopsmaybe
just
tone
down
the
yeastyspiced
notes
a
tad
nice
new
brew
from
blue
point
i
hope
this
one
is
widely
available
come
summer
time
o
incredibly
drinkable
with
stellar
balance
and
a
great
flavor
profile
this
is
definitely
my
surprise
beer
of
2011
imho
this
is
the
best
beer
bluepoint
has
ever
put
out
and
the
style
is
a
totally
new
direction
for
them
a
great
beer
that
i
will
look
forward
to
having
a
bunch
of
times
in
the
future
o
overall
this
is
pretty
solid
very
refreshing
and
great
for
the
warm
weather
i
was
fairly
impressed
with
this
beer
seems
to
fit
best
in
the
ba
category
of
belgian
ipa
or
belgian
pale
ale
but
the
description
at
the
growler
station
listed
it
as
a
wit
ipa
hybrid
a
belgium
white
ipa
if
that
sounds
good
to
you
you
may
enjoy
i
didnt
care
for
the
taste
but
belgium
whites
and
ipas
are
not
my
favorite
styles
good
strong
spiced
fruit
aroma
follows
into
the
front
and
turns
into
a
good
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
nice
boozy
kick
at
the
end
pours
hazy
gold

with
a
small
white

aroma
and
taste
is

overall
a
good
refreshing
session
belgian
style
ipa
o
nice
enough
and
on
the
better
end
for
a
white
ipa
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
call
this
one
but
white
ipas
are
really
confusing
an
underrated
beer

an
underrated

i
envisaged
the

here

assreamed
by

and
this
is
the
result
i
have
to
say
its
turned
out
well
theres
just
enough
ipa
to
satisfy
me
and
the
belgianness
isnt
halfhearted
in
execution
i
was
pretty
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
had
on
tap
at
sticks
and
stones
a
few
days
back
came
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
hazed
orange
infused
lighter
golden
with
a
somewhat
creamy
bone
white
head
that
really
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
like
glue
as
it
settled
into
a
frothy
mass
light
citrusy
hops
and
yeasty
spice
in
the
nosethe
yeast
is
bigger
in
the
aromas
than
flavor
wise
tangerine
notes
really
stand
out
on
the
palate

didnt
seem
as
big
as
it
is
either
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
alcohol
sweetnessmild
yeasty
spiced
notes
in
the
finish
not
a
bad
bipa
its
not
overly
yeasty
and
a
nice
fresh
fruity
hop
profile
the
taste
is
good
with
slight
hint
of
pear
and
slight
peppery
element
with
mild
herbal
flavor
leading
to
hint
of
sugar
and
mild
tinge
of
tropical
fruit
more
of
a
muted
pineapple
type
presence
with
subtle
malt
and
more
alcohol
as
it
finishes
with
good
yeast
flavor
not
as
intense
as
the
nose
lets
on
overall
i
enjoyed
this
however
it
is
more
of
a
hoppy
triple
than
white
ipa
the
hops
balance
so
imperial
wit
might
not
be
appropriate
but
it
seems
like
just
another
beer
trying
to
jump
on
the
ipa
bandwagon
to
sell
rather
than
market
it
as
a
belgian
wheat
which
might
not
be
as
popular
i
believe
this
beer
to
be
slightly
underrated
its
really
smooth
well
balanced
and
drinkable
you
get
some
of
the
citrusy
topicalness
along
with
a
slight
funky
spice
note
like
youd
get
in
a
witbier
its
clean
refresing
perfect
alcohol
content
not
quite
chuggable
but
you
dont
need
to
sip
it
either
poured
a
slightly
cloudy

with
a
creamy
white
head
the
head
has
decent
albeit
thin
head
and
some
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
their
loose
cannon
but
slightly
milder
due
to
the
wheat
in
the
grain
bill
the
taste
is
similar
this
is
like
loose
cannon
light
which
is
in
no
way
a
bad
thing
a
little
thinner
on
the
body

nice

fairly
high
abv
to
american
standards
is
not
evident
in
the
mouthfeel
or
taste
o
looks
great
but
disappointed
after
that
probably
doesnt
help
that
i
have
recently
had
a
few
other
white
ipas
that
knock
this
one
into
the
dirt
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
flavorful
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
overall
decent
pretty
standard
for
the
style
not
great
not
bad
nothing
new
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
not
overboard
with
flavors
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
o
a
very
interesting
ale
i
think
this
may
be
the
first
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
and
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
in
the
future
od
definitely
tastes
like
a
slightly
hopped
up
wit
age
might
be
holding
this
back
though
hop
character
is
a
bit
generic
with
no
real
flavour
characteristics
coming
out
decent
though
overall
a
pretty
solid
brew
but
nothing
all
that
exciting
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
again
but
it
was
still
worth
trying
once
o
decent
ipa
nothing
i
would
grab
again
overall
an
okay
summer
offering
not
something
i
would
seek
out
outside
the
summer
months
would
be
interesting
trying
closer
to
its
bottling
date
to
see
how
the
hops
affect
the
taste
although
in
my
experience
and
perhaps
i
dont
care
for
that
style
more
hops
have
not
necessarily
meant
a
better
beer
had
this
at
the
dog
duke
of
gloucester
in
williamsburg
va
street
pub
on
cask
it
starts
out
the
color
of
a
belgian
wit
starts
out
like
a
witbier
but
them
the
hops
kick
in
unlike
any
cask
ale
ive
had
to
date
i
tend
to
rate
this
beer
a
little
high
but
anyone
who
makes
cask
ale
in
the
states
deserves
all
the
support
they
can
get
kudos
to
heavy
seas
and
their
cask
program
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
rather
interesting
as
it
seems
like
a
hybrid
between
a
witbier
and
an
india
pale
ale
tastespicy
yeast
citrus
hop
notes
a
bit
unbalanced
to
my
taste
a
valiant
effort
that
almost
works
overall
this
wasnt
what
i
expected
hoping
for
more
bitterness
balanced
with
the
sweetness
but
if
im
craving
a
belgian
ale
this
is
a
decent
option

really
enjoyed
this

this
is
a
good

beer
that
is
easy
drinking
compared
to
most
belgians
but
the
flavor
is
something
to
be
desired
for
me
overall
my
search
for
a
tasty
ipa
continues
ipa
fans
may
like
it
but
i
just
couldnt
come
to
terms
with
the
bitterness
pours
a
slightly
hazy
lighter
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
mellow
citrus
hops
in
the
taste
lighter
pine

mellow

all
the
way
through
a

and
a

lighter

mouthfeel
with
a
dry
and
minty
pine
hop
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
mix
of
hops
quite
nice
and
pleasant
overall
i
am
still
more
of
a
fan
of
the
loose
cannon
the
belgium
yeast
really
does
take
the
bitter
edge
off
this
great
ipa
may
be
best
since
some
really
love
it
this
is
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
and
buy
again
it
is
recommended
for
when
you
want
a
full
flavored
american
version
of
one
of
these
without
the
over
the
top
syrupy
taste
what
a
delectable
beer
its
spirited
rambunctious
but
not
overly
forceful
or
conceited
its
the
happy
collision
of
two
fantastic
worlds
where
the
characteristics
of
an
ipa
meet
a
proper
belgian
poised
and
unique
this
is
my
first
white
ipa
and
i
love
the
style
its
graceful
but
fun
loving
odbelgian
ipas
are
really
hitormiss
with
me
this
was
pretty
close
to
a
miss
spicy
and
sweet
with
not
many
redeeming
factors
smells
like
a
witbier
drinks
like
a
cross
between
a
witbier
and
an
apa
interesting
characterful
brew
thats
fairly
refreshing
d
overall
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
however
i
think
it
is
missing
the
mark
a
little
regarding
being
a
bipa
drinks
more
like
a
belgian
golden
or
a
lighter
abv
belgian
tripel
bring
some
more
hop
component
heavy
seas
and
you
will
have
a
solid
offering
o
pretty
much
just
as
good
as
dubbel
cannon
only
a
touch
less
zesty
it
seems
like
at
least
in
my
experience
that
the
only
heavy
seas
beers
that
are
any
good
are
the
ones
where
hops
are
involved
otherwise
they
range
from
terrible
to
okay
i
would
recommend
this
one
though
overall
a
good
bipa
more
tripel
characters
like
others
would
be
nice
but
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
one
food
pairings
banana
gelato
a
juicy
mid
rare
cheeseburger
with
that
really
thick
american
cheese
on
a
potato
bun
with
ketchup
mayo
and
butter
lettuce
grilled
chicken
over
an
apricot
salad
beef
satay
with
a
spicy
peanut
dipping
sauce
gotta
be
one
of
the
best
white
ipa
o
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
this
is
a
great
blend
of
belgian
whitewheat
and
a
mild
ipa
dont
come
into
this
beer
expecting
wild
bitterness
but
a
beer
thats
bursting
with
a
truck
load
of
flavor
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
has
changed
my
mind
not
the
best
white
ipa
ive
ever
had
that
belongs
to
dc
brauunion
yonder
cities
but
a
damn
good
one
that
ill
be
happy
to
sip
on
this
summer
fresh
release
into
ohio
from
cavalier
distributing
pours
a
glowing
orange
golden
hued
slightly
hazed
as
the
yeast
sediment
disperses

cigar
smoke

the

this
is
produced
in
nicaragua
by
don
pepin
garcia
at
the
my
father
cigar
factory
wrapped
with
a
beautiful
mexican
san
andres
wrapper
im
in
love
with
the
pairing
and
intrigued
by
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
brewed
in
baltimore
yet
carries
ipa
and
witbier
characteristics
that
have
been
formed
from
a
love
of
west
coast
ipa
and
belgian
artisanal
ales
what
a
hybrid
of
pairings
anyways
on
to
the
flavor
of
the
uber
fresh
white
ipa
heavy
handed
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
hops
with
bready
yeast
and
spice
laying
down
the
law
it
leaves
a
lingering
bitterness
catching
those
hops
and
house
belgian
style
yeast
together
but
leaves
an
impeccable
complexity
of
tropical
fruit
including
mango
and
pineapples
with
tones
of
passionfruit
the
spices
come
off
very
perfumey
like
walking
through
a
womens
dressing
room
after
a
hoard
of
single
females
prepare
to
go
out
for
a
night
on
the
town
it
catches
me
with
some
balance
but
the
extreme
contrast
of
flavors
that
appreciate
in
a
format
that
turns
the
volume
up
this
loud
is
a
bit
distracting
from
what
the
base
beer
could
actually
provide
to
the
drinker
without
all
of
the
background
noise
i
know
its
a
trend
to
blend
these
two
styles
and
this
isnt
a
horrible
version
of
it
it
is
just
one
that
im
not
so
keen
on
the
smell
is
beautiful
even
some
green
onion
notes
from
the
big
hop
barrage
makes
in
through
to
my
nares
its
just
the
clash
of
belgian
yeast
and
spice
with
the
ipa
that
leave
me
wanting
more
cohesion
and
less
clash
know
add
in
the
cigar
with
earthy
wood
and
sweet
tobacco
with
black
pepper
spice
and
we
have
ourselves
a
magnificent
pairing
mouthfeel
is
very
forgiving
with
a
dry
spice
lingering
bitterness
and
floral
earthy
pepper
notes
that
linger
kicking
in
but
tasting
rather
good
between
sips
the
mango
fruitiness
is
complex
because
it
limits
the
concentration
of
malt
sweetness
due
to
the
fact
that
its
mainly
derived
from
the
hop
varieties
used
in
this
beer
overall
im
happier
with
my
session
with
this
beer
than
the
flavor
description
details
indicated
a
very
fine
ale
from
hugh
sisson
and
company
of
baltimore
keep
bangin
out
these
beautiful
complex
ales
and
i
will
keep
trying
them
this
is
a
solid
belgian
ipa
i
like
this
much
more
than
dubbel
cannon
which
was
their
other
bipa
which
they
recently
retired
this
isnt
quite
the
belgian
equivelant
to
loose
cannon
which
ive
been
waiting
to
see
from
heavy
seas
its
enjoyable
but
leaves
me
wanting
more
all
aspects
of
this
beer
work
not
exactly
the
easiest
style
to
tackle
but
heavy
seas
prevails
long
live
the
white
ipa
overall
a
definite
must
try
beer
for
anyone
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
belgian
ipa
that
is
an
easy
drinker
full
of
typical
belgian
flavorings
and
just
enough
pop
in
the
finish
for
hop
heads
warm
to
close
the
beer
carries
with
it
a
soft
covey
minty
and
somewhat
vanilla
taste
thats
overshaddowed
by
grain
character
thats
very
charming
if
you
can
get
past
the
husky
bite
its
a
complex
ale
that
has
good
intentions
but
are
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
o
i
honestly
am
not
familiar
with
this
style
so
really
have
no
base
with
which
to
compare
it
was
an
ok
beer
although
its
not
something
i
would
return
to
again
and
again
still
it
was
really
interesting
and
fans
of
this
style
may
enjoy
this
is
a
decent
bipa
there
is
a
nice
herbal
hop
character
here
which
makes
this
pretty
enjoyable
unfortunately
this
beer
is
simple
and
borders
on
boring
after
a
while
its
definitely
a
nice
addition
to
the
heavy
seas
lineup
but
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
visit
often
thanks
again
to
dan
low
carbonation
sweet
belgiantype
hop
bitterness
relatively
easy
to
drink
easy
for
the
abv
nothing
really
special
but
the
typical
expected
flavor
and
quite
ordinary
for
the
style
pretty
good
lots
of
hops
the
way
i
like
it
delicious
i
liked
it
a
lot
but
be
aware
that
this
a
bitter
hoppy
belgian
ipa
great
complex
taste
though
imagine
a
slightly
boozy
bipa
w
good
fruitypeppery
character
i
think
the
abv
is
closer
to
8
5
than
7
5
shorts
website
lists
this
as
a
8
4
abv
im
not
a
huge
ipa
guy
but
this
was
very
good
glad
i
picked
it
up
overall
this
beer
was
quite
complex
the
aroma
had
so
many
things
going
for
it
yet
the
taste
was
only
able
to
capture
a
few
of
those
characteristics
and
probably
my
least
favorite
ones
work
some
of
the
lemon
grapefruit
and
coriander
into
the
taste
and
this
beer
would
really
blast
off
a
yeasty
estery
beer
with
not
much
hop
character
the
spicy
phenols
and
restrained
use
of
hop
aromasflavors
dont
balance
the
yeast
out
like
id
like
them
to
shorts
doesnt
do
belgian
pales
very
well
in
my
opinion
despite
having
a
really
firm
grasp
on
many
traditional
european
and
american
beers
o
best
belgian
ipa
that
ive
had
most
are
either
not
hoppy
enough
or
too
yeast
or
too
sweet
this
one
has
a
great
balance

on

for

is

present
on
the
way
down
nearly
puckering
big
heavy
and
slick
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
pretty
unique
and
very
nice
i
absolutely
did
not
care
for
it
doug
and
i
agreed
that
this
beer
was
a
drainpour
and
acted
accordingly
tastefeel
well
not
being
the
biggest
fan
of
clovecoriander
i
dont
love
this
beer
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
and
its
just
not
what
i
had
expected
really
at
all
given
the
style
its
slightly
belgian
i
suppose
but
i
guess
im
just
used
to
those
walloping
belgian
ipas
brought
on
by
brewery
vivant
a
floral
spice
like
clove
is
the
first
thing
i
notice
then
it
turns
into
a
sweet
sort
of
citrus
and
by
the
end
theres
a
nice
malt
balance
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
and
i
dont
find
that
floral
sort
of
flavor
overpowering
so
this
is
something
i
really
enjoy
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
i
was
lead
on
to
believe
it
would
be
gargle
blaster
slowly
grew
on
me
as
i
worked
my
way
down
the
glass
o
decent
offering
from
shorts
wouldnt
turn
down
but
wouldnt
seek
out
o
outstanding
definitely
worth
a
sixpack
purchase
if
youre
seeking
it
out
overall
a
well
crafted
and
strong
hoppy
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
very
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
it
all
came
together
very
well
with
some
great
balance
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
clean
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
it
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
i
could
see
myself
being
pretty
happy
drinking
a
few
of
these
and
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
summertime
beer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
aroma
they
were
both
very
good
and
i
couldnt
stop
smelling
and
tasting
it
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
theres
not
a
single
thing
that
i
didnt
like
or
would
change
its
great
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
i
bought
my
limit
of
three
and
if
theres
any
left
next
time
i
go
to
the
beer
store
im
sure
i
will
get
my
limit
again
and
i
will
for
sure
be
getting
it
when
they
release
it
again
next
year
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
or
anybody
who
likes
hoppy
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
just
as
good
as
i
remember
and
so
far
i
think
its
my
favorite
of
the
style
i
like
it
a
little
more
than
brewery
vivants
trebuchet
i
like
the
hop
profile
in
this
beer
just
a
little
more
this
made
for
a
great
700th
review
it
was
a
nice
treat
to
celebrate
this
milestone
with
such
a
great
beer
when
i
was
at
shorts
i
told
the
bartender
that
i
really
think
they
should
bottle
it
and
apparently
i
wasnt
the
only
one
since
my
wish
came
true
thanks
a
lot
for
continuing
to
give
the
good
people
from
michigan
exactly
what
they
want
theres
no
doubt
shorts
is
my
favorite
brewery
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
pours
a

that
fades
slowly
with
great

smell
has
a
hint
of
belgium
yeast
with
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
notes
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
medium
to
lighter
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
great
ipa
without
to
much
of
the
belgian
flavors
that
would
mask
the
hops
flavors
o
this
is
a
solid
ameribelgo
dipa
i
usually
dont
prefer
the
belgian
style
ipas
but
this
is
nice
because
the
robust
american
style
hops
take
center
while
the
belgian
flavors
are
secondary
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
shorts
this
is
the
best
of
the
bunch
in
my
book
pleeaaase
bottle
it
this
was
brewed
exclusively
brewed
with
galaxy
hop
they
supplied
a
amazing
citrus
tropical
flavor
and
nose
i
didnt
get
a
ton
of
belgian
flavors
but
i
beg
they
bottle
this
one
o
not
my
favorite
to
much
hop
bitterness
for
me
just
the
right
hint
of
orange
and
not
overly
hoppy
nicely
done
serving
type
bottle
only
ever
so
slightly
grassy
on
the
finish
andbut
by
and
large
crisp
easy
drinking
nothing
special
but
ok
not
as
advertised
try
long
trail
farmhouse
white
ipa
instead
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
one
of
my
favorite
styles
witbier
combined
with
ipa
from
the
brewery
that
already
brews
my
favorite
ipa
to
date
i
would
like
to
stock
up
on
this
stuff
while
its
around
cuz
its
an
anytime
drinker
good
good
stuff
very
subtle
ipa
clean
and
crisp
great
to
pair
with
some
good
food
meringuelike
head
recedes
in
clumps
with
very
nice
residual
lacing
aroma
is
floral
but
faint
the
beer
tastes
good
but
this
estimable
flavor
is
also
too
mild
its
lemony
maybe
a
hint
of
fresh
asparagus
the
hops
character
is
subdued
in
keeping
with
the
belgian
style
refreshing
but
not
memorable
overall
great
taste
love
when
this
beer
is
out
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thin
foamy

head
retention
is
not
that
great
lacing
is
decent
more
of
a
grapefruit
and
lemon
aroma
with
hints
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
more
of
a
bready
malty
taste
at
the
beginning
there
is
a
good
hoppy
bite
hint
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
at
the
end
decent
beer
a
little
different
but
good
the
taste
is
very
good
with
a
orange
peel
flavor
that
dominanates
the
initial
taste
and
some
coriander
adding
that
tangy
lemony
brightness
followed
by
a
slight
herbal
and
citrus
type
hop
profile
with
malt
sweetness
balancing
the
taste
into
a
lightly
bitter
and
semidry
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
ipa
the
hybrid
character
of
wit
and
ipa
is
achieved
but
i
have
had
some
that
are
pull
it
off
with
more
hop
focus
this
is
a
solid
ipa
a
little
cloudy
light
on
mouthfeel
but
good
flavor
way
underrated
as
far
as
im
concerned
everyone
who
i
give
one
to
really
likes
it
it
is
very
well
balanced
with
not
the
strongest
hop
profile
i
will
admit
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
that
is
excellent
hop
profile
is
pretty
weak
pretty
good
beer
not
too
hoppy
our
too
white
a
good
balance
excellent
burger
and
tots
beer
like
a
lighter
bodied
version
of
their
ipa
very
pleasant
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
slight
wheat
notes
thats
a
quality
beer
dudes
its
not
as
bitter
as
most
ipas

color
had
a
bubbly
quickly
dissipating
head
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
sweeter
then
it
tastes
as
you
drink
this
beer
the
inside
of
the
glass
is
coated
in
foam
i
love
the
taste
and
feel
of
this
beer
it
is
thick
but
not
too
thick
a
very
mild
thickness
the
taste
is
initially
sweet
with
a
bitter
orangey
finish
you
gotta
try
it
the
feel
is
light
and
has
a
great
smooth
body
that
helps
it
go
down
easy
there
is
a
silky

what
you
are
going
to
get
that
said
when
a
beer
incorporates
spices
and
coriander
i
would
imagine
that
it
will
hold
up
nicely
i
got
a
massive
finger
of
dense
bonewhite
head
from
my
pour
that
slowly
fell
leaving
great
lacing
in
its
wake
nose
was
grassy
lemoncitrusy
and
with
a
tinge
of
pepper
nothing
wrong
there
and
my
mouth
was
beginning
to
water
as
a
result
nose
was
a
slightlyhazy
sunshine
yellow
srm

it
looked
like
sunshine
in
a
glass
which
would
have
been
more
appropriate
on
a
cold
overcast
day
but
i
pressed
on
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
almost
creamy
and
the
peppery
flavor
of
the
coriander
was
immediate
on
the
tongue
it
slowly
gave
way
to
a
lemony
taste
that
reminded
me
in
total
of
a
lemon
muffin
finish
was
semidry
and
very
refreshing
actually
this
could
be
a
summer
beer
for
that
mattter
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
an
unfiltered
appearance
with
sediment
one
familiar
with
beer
could
indicate
this
is
a
wheat
beer
others
might
say
cloudy
the
aroma
is
big
on
hoppy
and
wheat
citrus
kind
of
smells
like
cleaning
product
with
the
yeast
and
wheat
notes
meshing
with
a
firm
hoppyness
the
flavor
is
quite
good
with
more
citrus
notes
lemongrass
and
pine
moderate
bitterness
but
sticks
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
as
the
citrus
hits
the
taste
buds
the
body
is
light
with
a
prickly
medium
to
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
hoppy
ipa
like
an
american
hop
spiked
hoegaarden
o
normally
i
never
think
much
of
harpoon
but
every
so
often
they
surprise
me
this
is
one
of
those
pleasant
surprises
its
almost
great
in
fact
its
rather
simple
so
i
cant
break
out
any
4s
still
id
definitely
drink
this
one
again
this
one
goes
into
my
glass
with
a
2
finger
white
head
semi
hazed
golden
apricot
body
with
fine
speckled
lacing
as
the
head
fades
aromatics
bring
out
spicy
yeast
notes
citrus
peel
herbalcitric
hop
combo
this
one
actually
tastes
quite
nice
with
the
first
sip
thoroughly
enjoyed
hints
of
tangerine
oranges
on
the
palate
bitter
spicy
yeast
components
citric
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
combine
with
some
coriander
spice
and
wit
characteristics
along
with
elements
of
a
decent
ipa
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
and
bitter
between
hops
and
the
spice
mix
medium
bodied
sturdy
carbonation
it
really
works
for
me
im
a
fan
so
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
great
mix
of
different
styles
offered
in
some
of
harpoons
mixed
packs
overall
one
of
the
better
harpoon
beers
ive
had
so
far
as
i
continue
to
drink
through
their
offerings
i
like
the
strong
hop
presence
and
the
mellow
flavors
provided
by
the
spice
and
the
unfiltered
yeast
a
good
entry
level
standard
belgian
ipa
o
a
nice
refreshing
take
on
the
white
ipa
plenty
of
fruity
and
citrus
goodness
with
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
lightly
sweet
with
a
black
pepper
finish
closer
to
ipa
than
white
with
a
definitive
hop
bite
in
the
swallow
the
body
is
richer
than
expected
neutral
carbonation
creamy
finish
o
a
good
brew
a
profile
that
ushers
in
a
new
season
hazy
gold
with
some
sediment
floating
around
in
the
beer
thin
white
cap
of
fine
bubbles
some
lacing
decent
head
retention
citrusy
aroma
zest
and
grapefruit
fruity
rather
than
pithy
hint
of
resin
the
flavour
was
a
bit
sweet
up
front
a
little
malty
not
much
to
get
excited
about
i
enjoyed
the
finish
much
better
lingering
hop
bitterness
and
citrus
fruitiness
showed
up
once
the
malt
faded
spiciness
hung
around
for
a
while
too
hint
of
sourness
and
slickness
moderate
to
high
carbonation
with
mediumlow
body
interesting
and
pretty
good
poured
from
a
refrigerated
bottle
and
poured
into
a
over
sized
wine
glass
pours
a
beutiful
golden
color
looks
alot
like
a
pilsner
lager
smell
is
fruity
pineapple
and
mango
sweetness
from
the
hops
a
faint
belgian
yeast
note
and
a
biscuity
malt
background
with
faint
pineyness
the
taste
is
citrusy
bitter
hops
up
front
almost
a
dank
pine
resin
hint
cracker
breadyness
on
the
back
of
the
pallate
the
coriander
is
barley
present
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
the
carbonation
cleans
the
pallate
well
pretty
dry
overall
this
is
a
great
white
i
p
a
not
the
best
but
an
above
average
offering
in
my
opinion
cheers
im
a
big
fan
of
white
ipas
in
fact
i
think
its
my
favorite
style
and
my
favorite
beer
outright
is
accumulation
white
ipa
from
new
belgium
this
my
second
beer
from
harpoon
has
made
me
a
big
fan
of
what
they
do
this
beer
pours
excellent
without
too
much
spiciness
something
a
lot
of
wipas
over
do
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
o
not
a
bad
white
ipa
easy
to
drink
with
well
hidden
alcohol
i
could
easily
put
a
couple
of
these
back
in
a
session
nothing
great
but
a
solid
brew
overall
i
guess
they
need
to
brew
a
better
hefeweizen
before
tackling
such
a
complex
style
it
just
come
up
average
feel
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
decent
not
great
wouldnt
recommend
this
too
many
better
alternatives
wasnt
a
drain
pour
but
i
can
stomach
some
rough
beer
haha
drank
from
a
bottle
smells
good
tastes
great
a
really
good
seasonal
beer
from
harpoon
a
sharp
fruity
aftertaste
you
can
definitely
taste
the
coriander
goes
down
smooth
and
sits
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
nicely
definitely
makes
a
cold
day
enjoyable
try
this
brew
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
a
crisp
and
drier
ipa
that
is
on
the
more
refreshing
side
overall
a
decent
ipa
i
like
the
title
long
thaw
its
an
acknowledgment
to
how
much
winter
sucks
after
the
holiday
cheer
i
got
no
major
problems
with
this
brew
really
i
like
the
overall
effort
a
nice
change
of
pace
o
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
wish
this
was
available
for
more
than
just
the
spring
because
it
is
so
good
o
refreshing
beer
today
was
pretty
warm
and
the
evening
is
still
unseasonably
above
average
this
beer
just
feels
right
with
it
nice
rendition
of
a
belgian
ipa
the
taste
also
highlights
the
zesty
citrus
character
with
some
vague
spices
and
a
quickly
lingering
dry
finish
overall
very
good
ipa
overall
not
bad
better
than
i
expected
for
a
white
ipa
esp
from
harpoon
but
still
nothing
too
special
a
bit
too
thin
hops
arent
as
good
as
they
could
on
the
taste
spices
are
interesting
but
kept
mild
which
is
nice
just
been
drinking
this
beer
on
draught
in
a
wetherspoons
pub
it
was
absolutely
gorgeous
looked
good
and
tasted
superb
i
didnt
realise
it
was
so
strong
as
it
does
not
state
the
abv
on
the
pumpclip
so
it
made
a
mess
of
me
recommended
overall
not
that
impressive
as
far
as
harpoon
offerings
go
its
perfectly
drinkable
but
i
think
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
its
my
first
white
ipa
so
maybe
this
is
typical
of
this
style
a
very
nice
ipa
that
the
wheat
gives
a
nice
mouth
feel
i
would
buy
this
one
any
day
of
the
week
3
735
00
o
a
good
beer
and
interesting
in
that
it
combines
wheat
flavor
with
the
hoppy
bite
normally
associated
with
all
malt
ipas
this
wont
ever
be
my
go
to
beer
but
its
worth
a
try
and
an
occassional
6pack
o
incredibly
refreshing
bright
and
drinkable
i
am
not
a
hop
head
and
being
only
45
ibus
this
ipa
is
very
approachable
if
you
arent
big
on
more
hopforward
ipas
you
have
to
give
this
one
a
try
honestly
i
dont
understand
why
its
not
rated
even
higher
just
a
great
beer
my
review
does
not
seem
to
do
this
beer
justice
while
i
would
not
call
it
great
it
would
be
a
great
go
to
when
out
dining
or
at
the
bar
easy
drinking
has
a
pleasant
character
all
the
way
around
damn
smooth
drinking
brew
if
you
see
it
out
on
tap
grab
some
i
think
this
will
be
a
nice
addition
to
my
summer
brew
lineup
as
a
change
of
pace
nicely
made
overall
i
am
really
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
so
called
white
ipa
beer
style
of
late
but
this
one
is
very
unique
compared
to
others
i
have
had
anyway
we
had
singles
of
it
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
to
be
able
to
tell
customers
how
it
is
the
appearance
is
hazy
yellow
1
finger
white
head
plenty
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
all
nice
aspects
of
a
white
ipa
except
points
off
for
zero
lacing
aroma
seemed
very
faint
to
me
with
hints
of
orange
and
pineapples
in
there
somewhere
if
you
searched
for
them
the
flavor
outweighed
the
scent
by
a
long
shot
nice
burst
of
tropical
fruits
and
a
firm
but
not
overwhelming
hop
bitterness
lemons
or
limes
in
the
aftertaste
i
feel
like
theres
a
sort
of
tartness
or
sour
flavor
that
lasts
on
the
tongue
but
since
no
one
else
said
that
i
feel
kind
of
crazy
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
from
harpoon
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
six
pack
when
the
weather
starts
getting
a
bit
warmer
cheers
o
its
an
easy
going
ipa
with
nice
flavors
respectable
and
easily
approachable
whitebelgian
styled
ipa
worth
a
try
poured
into
my
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
best
by

pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
two
inch
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
webs
of
lace
smell
is
clove
mango
oranges
fresh
cut
grass
and
some
hints
of
banana
taste
is
all
of
that
a
nice
pucker
of
grapefruit
that
hangs
on
the
tongue
a
while
body
is
not
quite
medium
great
amount
of
life
a
little
dry
and
easy
drinking
for
sure
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
love
so
many
of
the
cross
breeds
toss
extra
hops
in
any
beer
and
i
like
it
rjt
overall
a
solid
refreshing
beer
that
also
has
body
and
might
serve
as
good
training
wheels
for
somebody
looking
to
venture
into
ipas
cheers
just
got
this
into
the
store
this
week
opened
the
bottle
to
a
great
smell
of
hops
mixed
with
citrus
poured
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
and
the
smell
got
even
better
small
white
head
and
a
cloudy
orange
copper
color
to
the
body
taste
of
hops
hit
first
then
the
citrus
and
spices
take
over
finishes
nicely
tangy
and
tart
at
the
end
very
refreshing
ipa
this
is
a
nice
white
ipa
this
has
an
intense
citrus
character
similar
to
their
ufo
beers
but
this
has
a
nice
herbal
piny
hop
character
that
rounds
out
the
flavor
nicely
there
is
good
balance
and
drinkability
here
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
so
today
is
my
birthday
and
we
ran
by
our
local
costco
to
get
some
beer
to
bring
to
a
friends
house
bought
a
case
of
harpoon
and
tried
to
share
they
were
drinking
pbr
and
would
not
partake
enjoying
my
third
beer
of
the
evening
and
really
enjoy
the
white
ipa
i
can
taste
the
orange
described
on
the
front
page
of
the
beer
but
cannot
taste
the
coriander
come
to
think
of
it
i
dont
know
what
coriander
tastes
like
the
beer
is
a
little
hoppy
but
i
tend
to
like
that
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
inexpensive
but
good
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
feel
is
lively
uplifting
and
very
easy
drinking
the
ipa
portion
of
this
blended
style
is
much
more
focused
than
the
white
aspect
having
never
had
a
white
ipa
before
i
was
not
really
sure
what
to
expect
i
think
this
was
done
pretty
well
and
would
not
mind
trying
other
examples
of
this
if
given
the
chance
thanks
again
matt
the
flavor
is
great
it
has
the
orange
zest
and
slight
tangy
citrus
from
the
hops
with
a
mild
pine
accent
and
slight
tropical
taste
with
yeast
adding
a
light
peppery
phenolic
element
and
wheat
giving
a
gentle
tanginess
which
adds
to
the
citrus
from
the
hops
overall
i
loved
this
all
the
best
elements
of
an
ipa
combined
with
the
belgian
wit
style
a
very
nice
hybrid
from
harpoon
taste
starts
with
sweet
pale
citrus
in
the
middle
and
sedate
pine
hops
character
feathers
into
the
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
nice
brew
too
bad
label
says
it
is
limited
o
this
one
surprised
me
im
not
a
huge
wit
fan
though
i
enjoy
a
good
belgian
ipas
who
doesnt
like
em
this
is
a
perfect
melding
of
the
two
i
picture
my
self
on
a
tropical
beach
drinking
these
down
all
day
long
harpoon
white
ipa
pours
out
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
laces
well
the
aroma
is
big
on
citrus
hops
that
are
very
well
rounded
by
the
belgian
yeast
the
taste
follows
with
a
very
nice
hop
character
for
the
style
that
actually
works
with
the
yeast
as
opposed
to
against
it
as
tends
to
happen
with
belgian
ipas
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
the
drinkability
goes
as
far
as
belgian
ipas
go
i
actually
like
this
one
its
basically
a
solid
ipa
with
just
a
little
bit
of
belgian
character
odthis
harpoon
brew
is
stellar
quirky
and
complex
this
is
one
of
harpoons
best
hoppy
offerings
this
one
should
be
a
yearrounder
toasted
grains
and
herbal
bitterness
up
front
hops
become
peppery
and
spicy
as
sweetish
fruit
juice
malts
fill
in
slightly
tropical
with
a
bit
of
strawberry
and
banana
grassy
herbal
slightly
citrus
hops
into
the
finish
lingering
spiciness
and
juicy
fruit
medium
to
moderate
body
another
nice
ipa
iteration
from
the
harpoon
mix
pack
d
very
complex
brew
and
i
have
to
say
its
pretty
damn
good
both
the
wit
and
ipa
styles
are
so
distinct
that
it
almost
clashes
at
times
but
is
still
so
interesting
that
you
cant
put
the
glass
down
definitely
worth
a
try
i
think
its
a
pretty
desent
beer
and
easy
drinking
has
summer
written
all
over
it
overall
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
belgian
ipa
as
its
listed
as
on
ba
but
regardless
its
a
great
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
apa
with
some
nice
fruity
notes
id
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
o
a
nice
refreshing
take
on
the
white
ipa
plenty
of
fruity
and
citrus
goodness
with
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
quite
easy
to
drink
as
well
so
far
this
is
a
nice
pack
of
ipas
onto
the
black
o
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
harpoon
and
actually
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
very
refreshing
beer
prefer
it
to
the
regular
ipa
o
great
pronounced
citrus
and
tropical
aromas
with
a
well
balanced
flavor
profile
very
refreshing
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
the
100
barrell
series
overall
a
tasty
ipa
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
might
be
a
little
biased
because
of
the
fact
i
am
a
huge
ipa
fan
but
maybe
it
works
for
me
in
me
telling
you
that
there
is
no
failing
when
making
this
beer
a
purchase
grab
a
glass
and
drink
salud
o
im
glad
i
got
it
for
under
ten
bucks
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
its
the
first
100
barrel
series
that
hasnt
particularly
wowed
me
served
from
growler
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
coriander
spice
citrus
and
citrus
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
citrus
earth
fruit
and
coriander
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
really
like
what
i
found
on
this
brew
if
i
am
honest
there
was
a
nice
touch
of
complexity
and
balance
going
on
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
the
coriander
note
i
got
was
a
really
nice
touch
for
the
style
but
the
citrus
notes
were
what
made
the
beer
for
me
it
added
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
to
the
brew
to
keep
me
smelling
and
tasting
it
as
long
as
my
sample
lasted
could
easily
crush
a
pint
of
this
and
maybe
a
few
more
while
i
was
at
it
i
suggest
you
take
a
chance
on
this
one
as
well
o
a
great
take
on
a
white
ipa
they
should
make
this
a
regular
poured
into
a
small
tulip
glass
a
slightly
hazed
peach
tinged
lighter
golden
with
a
half
finger
lacey
white
head
atop
the
aromas
really
dont
jump
out
at
ya
but
the
citric
hops
are
therelemony
and
orange
notes
over
top
of
a
healthy
yeast
shot
lemon
oil
and
grapefruit
flavors
give
a
bright
and
sharp
flavor
some
breadiness
underneaththe
lemony
notes
linger
nicely
the
yeast
is
held
in
check
well
and
the
hops
are
brighta
solid
bipa
o
definitely
not
your
typical
beer
its
kind
of
a
hybrid
of
an
ipa
and
a
witbier
but
it
seems
to
work
very
well
drinkable
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
easy
to
consume
and
refreshing
well
worthy
of
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
the
wit
components
were
more
evident
in
the
appearance
and
smell
than
the
taste
in
which
the
wit
was
simply
an
accent
to
a
bright
ipa
overall
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
the
backbone
of
a
more
foresty
pine
sort
of
thing
it
goes
down
smooth
and
with
a
lot
of
flavor
the
bitterness
is
well
balanced
much
better
than
the
last
100
barrel
series
i
had
damn
no
fruit
i
guess
it
was
just
juicy
juicy
hops
this
whole
time
even
now
i
know
theres
not
fruit
in
here
but
i
still
taste
it
weird
i
enjoyed
and
am
still
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
harpoons
bwhite
ipa
pours
a
very
cloudy
tangerine
with
three
fingers
or
so
of
fluffy
white
foam
rising
to
the
rim
of
the
glass
head
retention
is
pretty
good
and
the
foam
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
and
leaves
lacing
pretty
well
the
nose
has
a
little
bit
of
spice
to
it
but
otherwise
just
lots
of
juicy
citrus
aromas
wafting
up
from
the
glass
theres
a
lightly
appreciable
wheat
graininess
right
at
the
open
before
a
sturdy
bitterness
makes
itself
known
the
hoppy
finish
has
some
orange
tinted
citrus
flavors
but
its
not
quite
as
pungent
and
in
your
face
as
i
would
have
liked
the
body
has
just
a
little
bit
of
the
chewy
quality
that
i
sometimes
associate
with
wheat
the
carbonation
its
matched
with
though
is
just
not
lively
enough
harpoons
newest
entry
in
the
100
barrel
series
is
a
good
take
on
the
new
white
ipa
trend
but
it
could
stand
to
be
a
little
bit
hoppier
pretty
mellow
maybe
more
of
a
wit
than
an
ipa
very
enjoyable

d
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
100
barrel
series
ive
tried
to
date
its
got
a
little
bit
of
everything
and
worthy
of
a
try
a
hazy
orange
body
with
a
foamy
twofinger

the
cap
fades
slowly
revealing
some
spider
web
lacing
the
nose
is
of
oranges
wheat
candied
grapefruit
and
some
spicy
pepper
on
the
palate
candied
grapefruit
and
oranges
dominate
the
palate
a
clean
bed
of
hay
and
spicy
pepper
with
some
soft
apple
and
grape
laying
low
even
some
sweet
vanilla
and
grassy
notes
in
the
finish
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
the
finish
is
sweet
and
dry
white
ipas
work
if
they
are
clean
and
tight
the
candied
grapefruitorange
and
sweet
malt
are
just
too
dominant
to
let
the
base
wit
flavors
poke
through
decent
but
nothing
special
o
this
is
a
fine
white
ipa
im
giving
much
of
the
credit
to
the
citra
hops
though
the
bottle
says
there
are
others
i
think
simcoe
and
cascade
in
the
mix
as
well
i
treated
this
one
like
a
session
brew
gulp
gulp
gulp
but
its
nice
n
complex
and
well
worth
sipping
this
is
easily
of
the
very
best
from
the
small
batch
collection
overall
this
is
good
fare
and
certainly
an
interesting
mix
of
witbier
and
ipa
by
themselves
each
of
these
styles
are
well
represented
in
here
and
would
make
for
a
delicious
beer
together
they
have
great
potential
to
become
something
greater
and
do
for
the
most
part
but
in
the
end
the
grapefruit
zest
from
the
hops
simply
overpowers
everything
and
makes
the
aftertaste
messy
traditional
ipa
flavor
i
cant
detect
the
wit
portion
of
this
beerno
wheat
in
the
flavor
this
is
a
dry
beer
also
i
dont
detect
any
belgian
styled
yeast
still
this
is
a
good
ipa
the
body
is
predictably
average
the
carbonation
slightly
elevated
im
glad
harpoon
seems
to
be
doing
some
more
interesting
experimental
things
with
the
100barrel
series
again
black

spruce

white
ipa
do
more
like
these
and
ill
pay
attention
i
didnt
bother
to
try
the
ginger
wheat
and
maple
wheat
that
theme
is
old
and
busted
o
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
within
the
style
ill
second
the
bland
part
it
just
doesnt
feel
right
but
that
could
easily
be
carbonation
level
etc
frankly
im
blown
away
at
the
level
of
hop
aroma
and
flavor
coming
out
of
this
beer
the
grapefruit
notes
really
give
the
beer
character
while
the
lingering
orange
flavor
adds
a
little
something
extra
with
each
sip
quite
simply
excellent
im
fairly
new
to
the
style
though
i
guess
the
style
is
new
in
general
but
i
like
it
my
unbiased
pick
as
the
father
vs
son
beer
battle
winner
more
complex
than
i
anticipated
a
lot
going
on
with
the
hop
profile
and
as
it
bounces
off
the
wit
side
of
the
brew
it
does
well
but
comes
back
in
a
different
way
as
it
was
to
compliment
and
somewhat
clash
at
the
same
time
the
most
interesting
white
ipas
brewed
that
i
have
tried
the
ufo
brand
should
take
this
beer
on
it
is
that
good
overall
this
is
definitely
the
best
white
ipa
ive
ever
had
and
absolutely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
ill
definitely
buy
a
few
more
of
these
while
theyre
still
around
m
lightly
carbonated
just
thick
enough
really
pleasant
not
bad
i
like
it
dont
love
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
12
inch
head
that
stays
for
a
little
bit
moderate
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
aroma
is
hoppy
with
citrusgrapefruit
being
the
most
overwhelming
characteristic
very
pleasant
slightly
sour
finish
but
overall
very
solid
and
enjoyable
a
orangey
citrus
ipa
with
spice
aroma
which
is
very
unusual
it
doesnt
work
100
but
is
not
altogether
objectionable
either
so
not
a
great
ipa
but
not
bad
bevmo
had
a
these
for
half
off
at
8
for
a
12pack
i
filled
my
fridge
with
this
very
decent
and
drinkable
if
a
bit
unconventional
ipa
the
verdict
good
beer
this
is
a
mild
blonde
brew
with
plenty
of
citra
hops
well
balanced
with
a
nice
citrus
flavor
bonus
i
picked
it
up
from
bevmo
at
a
great
price
overal
this
beer
is
ok
not
something
id
actively
seek
out
again
but
not
something
id
be
disappointed
in
seeing
again

there
is
nothing

the

smooth
the
bitterness
is
not
overpowering
in
this
brew
it
is
a
nice
touch
you
pick
up
on
some
citrus
brew
but
not
much
the
mouthfeel
is
an
clean
saranac
white
ipa
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
all
spring
and
summer
very
enjoyable
beer
from
saranac
who
kind
of
drifted
away
from
me
in
the
craft
beer
market
over
the
years
this
beer
will
make
me
want
to
come
back
again
as
this
is
one
of
their
better
beers
ive
had
in
many
years
like
i
said
a
very
cloudy
beer
which
at
first
i
attributed
to
the
initial
pour
from
the
keg
the
second
and
third
pour
gave
me
the
same
cloudy
results
not
in
a
bad
way
but
a
little
unexpected
since
this
beer
is
a
mixture
of
two
equally
distinct
styles
if
you
like
the
belgian
witbier
ipa
style
this
beer
is
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
overall
a
3
75
for
saranac
white
ipa
from
matt
brewing
company
i
think
they
did
a
pretty
good
job
with
this
fusion
style
of
brew
its
not
outrageously
awesomebut
i
like
it
all
the
same
ill
probably
pick
this
up
again
o
no
nonsense
well
made
would
drink
again
pours
a
cloudysmokey
offwhite
copper
smells
fruity
taste
is
not
overpowering
overall
i
am
gonna
have
to
say
its
nothing
special
perhaps
its
needs
a
little
more
bite
for
my
taste
its
not
an
unpleasant
beer
but
its
nothing
so
memorable
that
it
deserves
any
special
praise
either
this
is
actually
pretty
decent
for
a
belgian
ipa
carries
a
lot
of
the
trademark
characteristics
the
one
detractor
is
the
almost
soil
flavor
to
it
i
cant
quite
say
its
too
earthy
because
its
more
like
dirt
really
but
overall
its
consistent
and
pretty
well
done
a
good
one
from
saranac
part
of
an
assorted
sixer
called
an
adirondack
trail
mix
popping
the
top
this
brew
has
a
citrusy
and
piney
hop
smell
pours
into
a
handy
glass
to
a
cloudy
faded
yellow
with
an
off
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
a
bold
sourness
upfront
then
gets
a
little
spiced
malt
sweetness
followed
by
a
bitterness
of
the
hopping
that
then
fades
into
the
finish
kind
of
a
unique
flavor
odd
indeed
used
to
like
this
better
still
pretty
clean
tasting
but
too
dry
the
hops
arent
there
like
i
remember
its
too
perfumey
still
a
clean
drink
and
i
can
go
through
a
sixer
and
not
mind
getting
it
again
in
fact
all
saranac
beers
have
agreed
well
with
me
just
not
always
blowing
my
mind
with
flavor
a
very
nice
ipa
i
really
liked
this
one
overall
its
okay
like
many
saranac
beers
the
better
ones
at
least
it
just
falls
a
bit
short
o
this
would
be
a
really
great
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
and
it
is
going
down
pretty
well
on
this
warmer
fall
evening
here
in
nc
light
hybrid
style
of
beer
with
attributes
of
belgian
ipa
and
witbier
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
get
it
again
overall
an
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
imo
first
time
trying
a
white
ipa
and
im
not
dissapointed
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
its
crisp
and
initially
its
not
quite
smooth
the
medium
body
titlts
to
the
lighter
side
and
its
definitely
refreshing
smoothness
kicks
in
toward
the
middle
and
finishes
it
out
this
is
a
cloudy
blondemuddy
brew
it
has
a
thin
quickly
disappearing
head
the
brew
is
average
looking
at
best
light
brown
at
the
edges
with
yellow
fringes
the
smell
is
spicy
with
citrus
peel
for
an
ipa
the
beer
has
a
very
subtle
hop
scent
the
taste
is
equally
unremarkable
spritzy
balanced
and
a
bit
hoppy
with
a
moderate
bitterness
medium
in
body
overall
this
is
reasonably
tasty
stuffits
certainly
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
regularly
i
dont
feel
it
really
does
all
that
could
be
done
with
the
style
but
its
interesting
enough
in
its
way
im
pretty
happy
with
it
overall
a
very
well
done
whitebelgian
ipa
from
saranc
great
flavors
and
mouthfeel
with
very
nicely
done
smell
o
i
like
the
idea
but
im
not
sure
it
works
the
citrus
comes
in
too
late
too
light
and
too
flat
peel
vice
pulp
the
spices
dont
seem
to
complement
the
overall
flavor
of
the
beer
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
and
refreshing
for
a
warm
day
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
o
a
very
pleasant
surprise
ive
had
saranac
offerings
that
were
run
of
the
mill
this
stands
out
it
holds
its
own
as
is
and
compares
well
or
better
to
others
in
this

pops
like

looks

white
foam
sits
on
top
stiff
pine
opening
nose
murky
citrus
in
nose
as
well
taste
is
a
blend
of
malt
citrus
yeast
and
a
light
hop
some
bitter
sticks
out
at
the
finish
really
smooth
with
enough
kick
to
leave
a
mark
quite
good
actually
o
what
a
great
example
of
what
this
now
popular
style
can
be
amazingly
drinkable
overall
picked
up
in
a
sampler
but
dont
think
i
would
actually
buy
a
pack
of
it
itself
good
to
have
but
wouldnt
say
it
i
would
keep
having
it
still
satisfies
salud
it
looks
like
a
creamsicle
in
color
the
cloudiness
is
thick
but
its
pretty
the
smell
predominately
reminds
me
of
grapefruitflavored
cough
drops
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
orange
and
tangerine
is
quite
nice
the
taste
is
only
slightly
less
enjoyable
than
the
smell
but
its
a
good
taste
the
carbonation
fills
the
mouth
entirely
this
is
an
interesting
ipa
especially
its
appearance
i
like
it
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
but
itd
be
because
it
came
in
a
sampler
looking
at
this
you
ask
yourself
this
is
an
ipa
unfiltered
opaque
golden
almost
orange
color
with
bit
more
head
than
usual
the
stream
of
carbonation
adds
a
nice
touch
fruity
floral
citrus
notes
you
can
definitely
discern
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
used
in
tasting
youre
hit
with
an
intense
orange
citrus
note
and
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
consistent
over
the
palate
good
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
unfiltered
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
some
sediment
throughout
and
a
sparse
filmy
white
surface
coating
aromas
of
subtle
banana
and
clove
with
a
solid
resiny
and
green
overtone
cut
grass
is
in
the
nose
too
flavors
of
resiny
hops
and
lemon
on
a
sharp
crisp
body
first
with
more
of
the
clove
and
cardammon
spicing
at
the
end
a
bit
sharp
from
the
carbonation
and
light
body
but
tasty
lemon
zest
and
resiny
hops
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
sharp
crisp
slightly
drying
finish
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
low
to
moderate
carbonation
smooth
drinking
and
good
spice
mix
good
beer
would
drink
it
again
tired
of
people
saying
its
bitter
its
an
ipa
youre
supposed
to
taste
the
hops
if
you
cant
handle
this
one
then
i
probably
dont
trust
your
opinion
about
beer
anyway
i
saw
it
at
the
brewery
in
utica
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
have
been
kicking
myself
ever
since
for
not
buying
one
or
two
all
six
varieties
are
versions
of
ipas
including
a
dry
hopped
new
one
this
has
a
huge
sticky
head
that
stays
and
leaves
a
clumpy
covering
and
chunks
on
the
sides
super
cloudy
withs
a
dusky
golden
straw
color
wow
is
there
a
lot
going
in
the
nose
of
this
one
citrus
is
big
but
there
is
a
ton
of
other
aromatic
excitement
belgian
spice
melange
of
coriander
funky
yeast
and
bread
notes
pine
hop
bed
show
a
light
caramel
taste
is
hoppy
with
grapefruit
and
sweet
pine
spicy
notes
of
pepper
and
a
lemony
tartness
feel
is
crisp
with
good
active
carbonation
great
overall
a
hybrid
of
a
wit
and
an
ipa
with
a
unique
flavor
way
too
bitter
and
unpleasant
for
me
overall
i
enjoyed
this
american
ipa
similar
in
tasteappearance
to
a
blue
moon
but
a
refreshing
ipa
with
a
nice
fruityspicy
taste
i
would
happily
drink
this
ipa
again
good
job
by
matt
brewing
company
overall
i
think
this
is
past
its
prime
but
its
still
drinkable
its
very
much
though
reminding
me
of
blue
moon
just
with
more
bitterness
and
an
obvious
hop
presence
its
alright
i
would
like
to
try
one
i
know
is
fresh
this
beer
poured
with
a
fluffy
white
head
and
a
hazy
amber
body
its
not
the
richest
hoppy
belgian
ale
but
its
an
admirable
stab
at
the
style
id
call
it
a
belgianamerican
pale
ale
the
aroma
has
a
mix
of
bready
creamy
malts
mixed
with
sharp
fruity
and
citrus
rind
hops
the
flavor
picks
up
more
on
the
hops
but
they
roll
subtly
through
to
the
finish
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
good
mix
of
berry
fruit
and
grapefruit
with
light
spice
nice
beer
wow
hands
down
the
best
saranac
beer
i
have
ever
had
will
buy
again
a
hazy
golden
body
with
a
huge
billowy
paper
white
cap
good
retention
and
moderate
spider
web
lacing
some
stray
bubbles
find
their
way
to
the
top
the
nose
is
full
of
bright
orange
rind
coriander
pine
perfume
doughy
yeast
and
banana
seem
to
round
things
out
solid
aroma
my
first
venture
into
white
ipas
and
the
nose
on
this
is
pretty
enticing
the
flavor
profile
follows
the
nose
bright
orange
rind
throughout
with
coriander
banana
doughy
yeast
and
some
pine
in
the
finish
there
is
a
lingering
citric
bitterness
that
intermingles
with
the
spice
and
yeast
flavors
medium
body
with
on
point
carbonation
this
has
some
real
solid
qualities
and
is
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
there
is
a
nice
hop
imbalance
with
a
sturdy
wit
underneath
this
was
a
nice
surprise
o
i
have
enjoyed
every
beer
that
ive
tried
of
this
style
and
this
one
is
no
exception
bold
citrus
flavors
and
balanced
evenly
by
the
wheat
and
the
spiciness
leaves
a
pleasant
finish
one
if
the
next
ive
had
from
saranac
so
happy
i
picked
up
a
single
of
this
because
now
i
know
to
go
back
and
buy
a
full
sixpack
this
is
a
fantastic
wheat
ipa
so
full
and
rich
on
flavor
the
only
other
beer
that
is
similar
to
this
and
either
rivals
or
bests
it
is
sam
adams
whitewater
ipa
and
i
say
that
because
they
take
the
apricot
flavor
further
which
i
like
o
extremely
satisfied
with
this
beer
looking
forward
to
many
more
as
these
are
available
in
a
limited
release
12pak
for
only
ten
bucks
down
the
street
from
me
cheers
overall
i
cant
track
down
a
freshness
date
on
my
bottle
but
this
one
tastes
a
little
stale
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
but
there
isnt
any
vibrant
flavours
overal
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
beer
o
i
love
the
white
ipa
there
are
not
many
examples
of
this
style
that
are
less
then
10
for
a
4
pack
being
a
midwesterner
this
is
a
new
brewer
for
me
new

to
be
a
belgian

hot

golden

lots

o
this
is

i
could
see
myself
stocking
up
on
this
affordable
brew
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
was
my
first
take
on
the
style
and
it
has
been
my
favorite
so
far
i
hope
to
see
more
brewers
take
this
approach
nice
job
appearance
is
a
hazy
orange
tone
with
1
finger
of
an
offwhite
head
its
nose
contains
hops
citrus
spice
and
caramel
the
taste
is
pine
coriander
grapefruit
hops
some
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
the
carbonation
is
moderate
an
easy
drinking
white
ipa
that
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
i
have
tried
from
saranac
i
sensed
that
clarity
may
not
be
their
object
on
this
one
so
i
went
with
a
highly
aggressive
pour
resulting
in
a
finger
of
french
vanillacolored
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
downright
cloudy
orangishamber
like
freshly
squeezed
grapefruit
juice
nose
had
a
wild
melange
of
spiciness
and
hoppiness
going
for
it
the
coriander
was
big
followed
closely
behind
by
the
minty
hops
the
utica
boys
are
becoming
mighty
innovative
in
their
third
century
of
brewing
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
exactly
unlike
the
nose
i
caught
the
hops
initially
followed
by
the
orange
peel
then
the
coriander
on
the
tongue
very
nice
and
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
finish
was
bonedry
just
the
way
i
like
my
ipas
i
ight
have
thought
that
there
was
going
to
be
too
much
trying
to
happen
here
but
this
was
mighty
tasty
o
not
really
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
necesarily
seek
out
i
do
appreciate
matt
trying
things
like
this
though
overall
i
liked
the
flavor
but
i
cant
get
over
how
much
sediment
was
in
the
bottles
i
got
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
a
little
disjointed
i
bet
it
works
better
from
the
tap
than
the
bottle
o
on
the
whole
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
saranac
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
and
a
little
more
wheat
on
the
nose
two
styles
blended
together
and
i
think
the
matt
brewing
company
has
done
a
great
job
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
bright
golden
almost
orange
body
with
a
thick
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
leaving
a
white
lace
around
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
a
good
hoppy
ipa
but
the
wheat
does
not
provide
enough
of
a
base
for
the
hoppiness
it
is
a
good
beer
but
the
hoppiness
is
not
quite
balanced
as
it
sits
for
a
little
while
the
hoppiness
mellows
out
and
more
of
the
citrusorange
flavors
become
prevalent
making
it
taste
more
like
a
wheat
beer
a
different
style
that
was
fun
to
try
but
will
not
replace
any
of
he
favorite
ipas
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
nice
orange
straw
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
of
very
sweet
grain
and
flowery
hops
very
pleasant
tastes
of
a
belgian
in
terms
of
grain
with
floral
hops
very
nice
combination
and
balanced
this
light
bodied
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
goes
down
real
easy
overall
a
very
good
beer
pours
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
yellow
brown
as
foggy
as
it
gets
with
nice
white
lacing
a
solid
inch
worth
smell
is
orange
wheat
clove
and
a
hint
of
pine
taste
is
much
larger
with
some
assertive
grapefruit
to
finish
the
flavors
from
the
nose
body
is
large
for
the
abv
nice
carbonation
not
dry
and
very
drinkable
it
is
a
nice
beer
and
unique
even
for
this
new
style
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
but
it
isnt
an
entire
failure
hey
at
least
they
tried
to
do
something
interesting
and
thoughtful
it
just
didnt
turn
out
so
great
for
the
most
part
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
doesnt
taste
good
ill
probably
finish
the
bottle
o
light
spicing
but
strong
orange
component
in
this
very
drinkable
ipa
back
off
on
the
orange
peel
or
at
least
add
later
for
less
astringency
mayber
needs
more
of
a
dry
hop
approach

996pk
the
body
is
medium
and
a
little
sticky
soft
carbonation
on
this
overall
this
one
surprised
me
i
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
if
youre
looking
for
an
ommegang
or
duval
like
belgian
with
a
little
more
ipa
characteristics
i
dont
think
this
is
what
youre
looking
for
its
too
much
like
a
regular
ipa
in
my
opinion
a
decent
example
of
an
increasingly
popular
style
i
am
glad
they
made
this
one
more
ipa
than
witbier
saranacs
put
out
a
pretty
interesting
beer
in
their
white
ipa
now
thats
not
exactly
a
new
idea
but
theyve
done
it
pretty
well
and
i
think
to
a
certain
extent
its
because
of
the
way
they
did
it
a
lot
of
the
beers
ive
seen
like
this
have
started
by
bumping
the
white
ale
up
into
a
beefier
ipa
style
but
you
get
a
lot
of
wheat
malt
that
way
more
bodymore
fillingmore
malt
flavor
saranac
started
the
other
way
around
adding
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
to
an
already
decent
ipa
in
fact
the
citra
hops
are
so
bright
in
the
nose
id
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
it
straight
fortunately
theyve
kept
the
hops
a
bit
more
restrained
in
the
flavor
and
the
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
are
noticeable
as
well
they
appear
after
the
hops
theres
no
doubt
about
that
but
then
they
lend
it
another
interesting
component
that
helps
to
keep
it
pretty
drinkable
well
worth
trying
cheers
to
be
honest
labeling
this
an
ipa
seems
to
be
a
tad
generous
but
it
certainly
is
worth
checking
out
and
i
would
not
mind
if
this
became
a
yearround
beer
from
saranac
cheers
the
floaties
are
not
the
most
appetizing
part
of
this
beer
and
unfortunately
knock
the
appearance
down
a
couple
pegs
the
aromas
are
spot
on
for
the
style
with
a
good
emphasis
on
the
malts
the
flavor
is
decent
but
lacks
the
strong
hops
flavors
one
would
expect
to
find
in
an
ipa
if
anything
this
beer
is
more
like
a
belgian
pale
or
hoppy
witbier
on
the
plus
side
the
body
and
carbonation
are
spot
on
making
this
a
great
warm
weather
beer
saranac
white
ipa
is
a
very
cloudy
dull
golden
ale
with
a
frothy
bubbly
white
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
very
citrusy
aroma
like
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
it
has
a
very
smooth
medium
light
body
fluffy
in
the
mouth
with
a
dry
finish
it
tastes
citrusy
throughout
theres
lots
of
wheat
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
and
then
resiny
hop
flavor
takes
over
orange
peel
seems
to
be
ever
present
and
brings
everything
together
it
finishes
like
an
ipa
but
the
aftertaste
has
a
little
wheat
and
something
doughy
in
it
this
is
a
very
clever
beer
an
ipa
and
a
wit
work
together
very
well

tight
thin

rings

as
the

expresses

grapefruit

and

however

by
the
nose
mouthfeel

with
a
lively

and
a
light

overall
a
decent
albeit
lackluster
belgian
ipa
definitely
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
from
saranac
great
variation
of
the
style
easily
the
first
saranac
beer
ive
been
impressed
by
4
0
this
is
a
nice
twist
on
an
ipa
it
takes
many
of
the
traditional
characteristics
of
a
witbier
and
combines
them
with
an
intense
hop
character
the
flavors
come
together
quite
nicely
to
make
this
easy
to
drink
smooth
enjoyable
beer
hmm
a

interesting
mix
lets
give
it
a
whirl
pours
a
cloudy
faint

color
nice
head
to
it
medium
body
to
it
nice

bit
of
an
interesting
taste
upfront
is
the
white
aleish
part
get
some
lemon
notes
finishes
with
a
nice
hop
bite
and
smooth
and
clean
somehow
blends
together
quite
well
and
makes
for
a
tasty
brew
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
its
definitely
an
above
average
beer
worth
checking
out
o
its
not
a
bad
beer
i
wont
be
searching
this
out
again
however
id
like
to
see
a
wheat
ipa
with
some
more
hops
if
youre
looking
for
a
witbier
with
touch
of
hops
this
is
a
good
choice
o
is
this
the
best
value
in
craft
beer
7
for
a
sixpack
says
it
might
just
be
ive
avoided
saranac
in
the
past
but
if
this
ends
up
being
the
rule
from
them
instead
of
the
exception
in
the
near
future
ill
gladly
give
them
the
time
of
day
d
interesting
brew
a
malted
up
hopped
up
belgian
wit
like
i
said
above
i
wish
the
grain
made
a
little
bit
more
of
a
showing
saranac
the
floral
notes
the
complexity
of
the
spice
in
the
aroma
and
taste
the
wellformed
carbonation
all
mean
that
this
is
truly
well
done
o
very
interesting
beer
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
saranac
overall
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
like
the
combination
of
styles
witbier
and
ipa
it
works
well
i
almost
get
a
citrus
overload
from
it
i
recommend
trying
it
one
of
saranacs
better
beers
enjoy
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
of
this
style
unless
you
count
little
sumpin
sumpin
which
hides
its
wheat
roots
not
sure
its
quite
my
thing
but
id
try
another
id
like
to
see
more
of
this
style
but
it
definitely
needs
some
work
lots
of
hops
hearty
and
not
too
heavy
one
of
the
better
saranac
brews
that
ive
had
very
interesting
and
would
totally
have
it
again
overall
i
was
quite
surprised
how
well
balanced
this
beer
is
nothing
mind
blowing
but
very
solid
offering
from
saranac
my
favorite
saranac
to
date
o
this
is
a
unique
style
of
beer
that
manages
to
combine
the
refreshing
properties
of
a
wheat
beer
with
the
strong
citrusy
hop
aromasflavors
and
bitterness
of
an
ipa
it
would
be
the
perfect
beer
for
ipa
fans
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
absolutely
delicious
combo
for
witbeer
and
ipa
lovers
saranac
has
always
been
ok
for
me
but
this
one
really
competes
you
hear
that
matt
keep
it
overall
easily
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
matt
wasnt
expecting
this
but
lets
be
fair
this
beer
is
a
keeper
o
welp
its
probably
the
best
or
second
best
brew
ive
had
from
saranac
still
not
very
impressed
by
this
brewery
though
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
whiteishgolden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
alive
with
hops
and
citrus
taste
is
good
hops
spice
citrus
a
touch
of
wheat
well
done
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
sometimes
these
merging
of
styles
fail
but
saranac
got
it
right
with
this
one
sampled
on
february
25
2012
from
the
what
ales
you
mixed
12pack
the
pour
is
a
hazy
milky
lemonpale
yellow
with
a
quick
burst
of
fizzy
head
that
diminishes
almost
as
quick
as
it
erupts
there
are
aromas
galore
in
this
including
coriander
pineapple
other
spices
and
floralrich
hops
the
body
is
thin
to
medium
but
that
is
appropriate
to
the
style
the
taste
is
as
vibrant
as
the
aroma
with
hops
and
citrus
if
you
are
looking
for
malts
they
are
deemphasized
still
a
pleasant
beer
o
a
good
different
take
on
an
ipa
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
variation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppy
wheat
beer
wow
this
is
maybe
matt
brewingssaranacs
best
a
case
worthy
brew
that
looks
tastes
feels
and
drinks
great
great
stuff
here
for
anytime
of
year
especially
summer
oan
interesting
beer
my
first
tasting
of
this
type
is
enjoyable
as
an
alternative
to
usual
ipas
o
i
didnt
particularly
love
this
the
mouthfeel
was
just
too
much
to
overcome
for
me
too
thick
and
the
great
flavor
couldnt
save
it
for
me
i
wish
the
citrus
held
on
throughout
and
didnt
drop
out
towards
the
end
okay
saranac
brew
o
not
a
terrible
representation
of
this
relatively
new
style
its
still
a
saranac
product
when
saranac
tries
a
trending
style
i
shy
away
this
is
likely
the
best
they
could
do
with
a
product
that
hasnt
proved
its
full
worth
yet

interesting
ipa
is
a
cloudy
yellowish
iced
tea
color
with
a
modest
white
fringe
of
head
and
similarly
weak
lacing
the
aroma
captures
swampy
citrus
and
herbal
hop
qualities
with
a
nice
hoppy
bite
a
remarkable
but
this
one
just
didnt
sit
right
with
me
citrus
hops
the
white
ipa
definitely
has
a
place
in
todays
beer
world
interesting
flavored
brew
but
not
overly
so
hints
of
lemony
spice
then
a
big
stinky
marijuana
scent
follows
up
some
citrus
tones
found
in
the
smell
as
well
easy
on
the
tongue

each

has

i
can
see
the
white

spice
a
touch
of
clove
coriander
with
big
green
hops
bringing
the
citrus
clove
bitterness
this
one
seems
to
wear
its
orange
peel
on
it
sleeves
and
the
label
mouthfeel
despite
the
harsh
feel
and
medicinal
spices
left
on

theres
still
a

hops
supposedly
have
a
short
life
in

of
bitterness

personally
i
think
their

flavors
are
enjoyable
in
their
own

great
white

yeasty

pine
hoppy
flavor
is
akin
to
