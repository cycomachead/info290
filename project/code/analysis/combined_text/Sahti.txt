NA
b
o
overall
a
pretty
solid
interesting
beer
i
dont
think
this
is
my
favorite
style
but
out
of
the
4
sahtis
i
have
tried
so
far
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
i
liked
it
much
better
than
the
dfh
one
lots
of
sweet
fruits
and
spices
it
is
an
interesting
beer
worth
checking
out
ontap
at
the
clybourn
brewpub
although
i
think
it
was
more
of
a
67
abv
clear
amber
nice
finger
of
foam
good
lacing
nose
is
grain
and
very
present
juniper
which
is
also
present
in
the
tasteits
like
a
wonderful
ginryebeersour
hybrid
tart
on
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
a
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
ive
actually
never
had
this
style
before
so
i
dont
know
quite
how
to
judge
but
i
would
definitely
have
more
sahtis
if
i
saw
them
not
enough
sahtis
out
there
seriously
this
one
pours
a
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
vague
wood
and
sour
rye
bread
the
taste
holds
notes
of
biscuit
rye
spice
light
mint
juniper
berry
and
light
balsa
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
oily
feel
overall
a
very
nice
sahti
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
examples
ive
had
in
a
long
time
o
im
always
pumped
to
try
a
beer
in
an
outoftheordinary
outoftheeveryday
style
but
this
one
illustrates
why
the
sahti
style
hasnt
caught
on
gi
should
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
make
this
brew
a
big
fu
to
the
man
you
may
not
like
this
beer
but
your
palate
will
certainly
remember
how
it
was
wrecked
by
our
draconian
spice
bomb
lightly
tart
with
mild
astringency
that
suggested
apple
very
crisp
with
ample
carbonation
vague
spice
that
seems
derived
more
from
rye
than
juniper
nice
and
crisp
feel
the
overall
simplicity
and
easy
drinkability
begs
for
warmer
weather
it
would
have
been
better
with
more
noticeable
juniper
or
some
level
of
herbal
presence
overall
a
great
change
of
pace
to
much
tea
for
me
to
make
it
drinkable
what
some
would
find
refreshing
i
find
as
medicinal
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
goes
down
smooth
there
is
a
bit
of
a
dry
feel
to
this
beer
that
is
an
interesting
feature
but
leave
my
mouth
a
little
flat
this
would
go
well
with
the
properly
paired
food
that
might
compliment
this
beer
well
pours
a
kind
of
clear
straw
yellow
color
a
very
thin
head
leaving
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
according
to
the
style
description
this
isnt
very
accurate
as
far
as
the
clarity
goes
but
otherwise
just
looks
like
a
pale
lager
or
something
i
think
some
kind
of
spiced
ketchup
was
interfering
with
my
sense
of
smell
because
i
was
smelling
pumpkin
pie
spice
on
and
off
i
think
ill
write
it
off
as
something
in
the
room
because
when
i
tried
i
could
only
smell
the
beer
i
mostly
get
a
kind
of
herbal
smell
with
quite
a
big
pilsener
malt
backbone
but
also
a
bit
of
caramel
smell
or
toffee
like
little
suckers
whichever
kind
they
are
a
big
sugary
if
you
ask
me
almost
not
tartness
is
detected
here
which
i
would
expect
and
very
little
juniper
apart
from
the
kind
of
light
herbal
woody
floral
smells
mentioned
this
isnt
too
spicy
in
the
taste
but
i
get
it
as
i
pull
the
glass
from
my
lips
a
kind
of
sticky
woody
kind
of
spicy
taste
the
malt
has
a
pilsener
taste
no
hops
no
bitterness
just
sweetness
there
is
really
nothing
exiting
about
this
and
i
can
only
hope
that
it
isnt
an
accurate
representation
of
the
style
i
mean
it
doesnt
need
to
be
exiting
but
it
shouldnt
taste
like
some
kind
of
an
imperial
lite
beer
which
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
kind
of
a
good
balance
between
thin
and
full
like
a
more
syrupy
verison
of
some
very
light
adjunct
type
lager
theres
a
nice
bite
of
carbonation
which
may
be
about
the
most
interesting
part
of
this
and
it
drinks
kind
of
refreshing
and
light
but
there
is
very
little
of
interest
in
here
i
was
exited
to
try
a
new
style
but
i
highly
doubt
that
this
is
accurate
i
wouldnt
try
it
unless
its
your
only
shot
its
like
a
summer
beer
without
any
wings
not
a
sahti
according
to
what
ive
learned
about
it
at
all
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
mild
head
of
white
an
odor
of
a
very
large
amount
of
protein
yeast
almost
like
burn
hair
but
obviously
not
on
that
scale
or
that
displeasing
palate
is
quite
yeasty
and
a
juniper
fruit
sweet
the
beer
is
also
earthy
as
well
a
musky
twig
quality
something
i
find
quite
interesting
but
the
protein
make
the
earthy
seems
like
biting
fingernails
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
something
i
have
to
drink
up
on
a
bit
more
the
protein
doesnt
seems
to
make
for
a
hardier
beer
but
something
more
biological
in
this
case
i
will
have
this
again
in
a
few
month
in
the
face
of
another
of
this
version
light
to
medium
in
body
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
worth
a
revisit
if
i
have
a
chance
my
wife
just
tried
some
of
this
and
reminded
me
that
i
have
had
this
on
tap
at
goose
island
clyborne
6
to
7
or
so
years
ago
the
juniper
character
was
more
fresh
then
and
there
wasnt
any
real
tartness
to
that
beer
if
my
memory
isnt
failing
me
still
i
like
the
extra
tartness
in
this
beer
it
is
a
nice
clean
sourness
and
it
goes
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beers
character
perhaps
not
the
most
complex
of
beers
but
it
is
certainly
tasty
enough
this
would
definitely
be
a
great
hot
weather
beer
d
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
a
bizzaro
brew
but
it
really
isnt
this
could
be
marketed
as
a
light
and
slightly
fruity
beer
for
the
masses
sahti
is
fine
nothing
really
bad
about
it
but
its
not
entirely
interesting
either
i
cant
say
that
ill
be
looking
for
it
again
even
though
there
is
nothing
to
complain
about
d
very
enjoyable
and
dare
i
say
sessionable
when
i
first
tried
this
years
ago
i
remember
it
being
very
harsh
and
prickly
maybe
my
palate
has
evolved
maybe
the
beer
has
more
than
likely
its
a
little
bit
of
both
i
will
revisit
this
on
draft
at
clybourn
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
pretty
light
but
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
enough
to
make
me
want
more
update
june
2009
new
brew
the
nose
is
still
fresh
and
spicy
with
the
juniper
still
there
but
the
taste
of
this
one
is
quite
sour
not
as
balanced
this
time
lower
the
taste
score
by
12
some
less
drinkability
as
well
drinkability
is
good
there
is
a
solid
grouping
of
flavors
and
aroms
here
which
results
in
a
brew
bolder
than
most
others
this
light
cheers
very
drinkable
but
i
wanted
this
to
be
more
interesting
than
it
was
i
got
this
beer
on
tap
and
it
came
out
a
translucent
tarnished
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
didnt
really
stay
aromas
were
piney
and
yeasty
i
thought
his
was
a
very
interesting
brew
but
didnt
taste
much
like
beer
it
tasted
much
more
like
white
wine
to
me
i
would
liken
it
to
a
big
fat
chardonay
that
has
been
hopped
or
otherwise
bittered
i
definately
tasted
the
juniper
but
it
didnt
really
jump
out
at
me
mouthfeel
was
a
little
flat
and
thin
i
sucked
this
down
quickly
drinkability
this
is
good
but
not
great
which
holds
down
sesssionability
for
me
but
ill
visit
this
from
time
to
time
d
this
beer
is
unique
and
interesting
but
that
is
what
i
would
expect
from
a
traditional
sahti
not
that
i
have
had
very
many
the
pine
and
juniper
flavors
had
an
interesting
quality
that
comes
through
more
in
the
cask
than
in
the
keg
it
is
possible
that
the
sweet
and
tart
notes
were
off
flavors
but
i
think
they
gave
more
depth
and
interest
to
this
mysterious
style
and
i
think
they
were
designed
in
the
beer
this
incarnation
was
6
2
served
in
a
tulip
pours
a
hazy
golden
medium
white
head
forms
good
retention
and
some
lacing
smell
is
sweet
lots
of
rye
and
berries
wheat
pretty
mild
but
neat
taste
is
nice
and
malty
rye
has
a
strong
presence
grainy
with
citrus
and
juniper
berry
in
the
finish
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
has
a
bit
of
sourness
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
dry
beer
i
enjoyed
this
on
the
lighter
side
tastewise
but
an
interesting
and
tasty
brew
would
try
again
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
bringing
me
a
growler
of
this
one
pours
a
golden
color
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
packed
with
rye
notes
slight
juniper
aroma
as
well
but
the
rye
is
everywhere
on
this
one
i
dont
care
much
for
the
ryejuniper
mix
the
flavor
was
just
as
the
nose
described
lots
of
rye
with
hints
of
juniper
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
very
much
grabbed
a
growler
of
this
for
clvand0
and
hes
sharing
the
beer
pours
a
very
slightly
goldened
yellow
color
with
minimal
head
the
nose
is
full
of
rye
spiceyness
and
juniper
we
made
a
homebrew
over
the
summer
that
had
juniper
in
it
so
ive
been
exposed
to
it
the
flavor
is
definately
different
from
anything
i
have
ever
had
definately
a
lot
of
rye
flavor
going
on
in
there
it
has
a
slight
sweetness
on
the
swallow
and
the
juniper
hits
on
the
finish
hmmm
interesting
never
having
had
a
sahti
before
im
not
sure
what
to
expect
or
how
this
stacks
up
the
feel
is
shy
of
moderate
i
think
the
flavors
keep
it
from
being
highly
drinkable
this
would
be
a
good
beer
served
in
10
oz
glasses
definately
not
a
beer
if
you
dont
appreciate
the
rye
pours
dark
golden
with
very
little
head
and
no
lace
aroma
is
pale
malt
very
faint
citrus
hops
notes
and
a
slight
hint
of
the
juniper
berries
taste
is
a
bland
pale
ale
with
just
a
hint
of
the
berries
ive
had
this
in
past
years
and
it
was
excellent
but
the
2003
batch
just
isnt
very
tasty
taste
is
somewhat
dominated
by
the
rye
malt
used
very
dry
finish
and
low
carbonation
makes
it
very
dull
in
the
mouth
it
was
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
would
surely
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
enjoy
barrelaged
beers
bottle
poured
a
clear
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
offwhite
head
with
ok
retention
aroma
of
roasted

is
mostly
dominant
with
some
vague

notes
taste
is
dominated
by
roasted
malt
notes
with
light
dry
caramel
and
some
distant
spices
notes
body
is
light
with
medium

i
thought
this
was
short
on
character
and
not
something
i
would
seek
again
a
very
pleasant
surprise
for
me
i
will
search
this
one
out
again
great
winter
ales
this
beer
looks
good
and
smells
great
where
is
let
me
down
was
on
the
taste
while
it
is
a
decent
beer
it
does
not
taste
like
any
traditional
sahti
i
have
had
and
i
think
that
is
what
i
was
expecting
my
wife
is
finnish
and
every
summer
i
wind
up
drinking
sahti
homebrew
arctic
circle
seems
harsh
by
comparison
just
my
two
cents
worth
it
might
be
a
regional
thing
or
local
ingredients
but
i
have
not
had
a
sahti
that
tastes
this
bitter
if
this
beer
sounds
different
from
anything
else
on
the
market
its
because
it
is
arctic
circle
ale
is
bound
to
be
a
true
discovery
for
most
people
a
real
tough
one
to
properly
assess
without
much
experience
with
sahti
the
only
opinions
i
can
really
share
are
that
i
enjoyed
it
and
found
it
a
deeply
interesting
ale
this
one
is
absolutely
worth
the
adventure
and
exploration
final
grade
4
07
a
solid
a
huvila
arctic
circle
ale
is
a
stellar
herbed
beer
though
having
had
no
other
sahtis
i
cannot
provide
much
perspective
on
how
it
compares
to
other
examples
of
the
style
this
brew
manages
to
maintain
an
ideal
balance
between
syrupy
malty
sweetness
and
the
spicy
herbal
features
imparted
by
the
juniper
english
hops
and
rye
malt
great
stuff
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
at
all
a
fan
of
traditional
herbed
beers
gruits
etc
overall
definitely
a
different
experience
than
my
first
with
a
sahti
but
this
is
delicious
easy
drinking
and
potent
enough
to
warm
you
up
a
bit
on
a
cold
winters
day
pleasant
and
complex
this
is
my
first
sahti
and
this
is
a
delightful
and
well
made
beer
interesting
combination
of
caramel
malt
with
a
touch
of
juniper
resin
and
flavour
kept
in
really
nice
balance
with
some
rustic
yeast
characters
and
fruitiness
apples
and
mulled
peach
a
pleasant
herbal
finish
with
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
quality
but
artfully
balanced
with
the
lingering
malt
wellrecommended
what
a
special
and
unique
beer
tastes
like
some
of
the
ones
ive
had
done
with
birch
syrup
but
different
from
any
beer
on
the
market
its
a
deep
ruby
to
caramel
color
clearish
until
the
yeast
cake
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
starts
to
break
up
and
add
some
sediment
to
it
not
muc
light
getting
through
it
viscous
and
not
much
head
even
as
i
try
to
raise
it
up
where
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
less
appealing
in
looks
it
makes
the
beer
in
mouthfeel
love
the
density
of
it
carrying
the
pine
notes
of
the
juniper
and
the
sweet
malt
as
long
as
possible
and
its
heaviness
makes
it
a
perfect
winter
warmer
i
really
love
the
malt
in
this
its
so
deep
and
rich
caramel
and
toffee
and
butter
cream
in
a
good
way
the
juniper
is
less
intense
than
anticipated
especially
in
the
nose
where
it
only
adds
a
layer
rather
than
dominating
but
it
does
have
a
sappy
element
in
the
feel
which
works
smells
and
tastes
like
a
traditional
english
ale
yeast
and
therefore
makes
it
seem
just
a
little
like
an
english
barleywine
in
style
the
aftertaste
is
amazing
and
the
more
i
drink
this
and
let
it
warm
up
the
more
i
like
it
my
first
beer
from
these
guys
and
one
of
my
first
from
finland
if
not
the
very
first
i
would
love
to
travel
here
and
see
whats
out
there
in
terms
of
beer
this
is
so
different
from
anything
else
wonderful
o
an
intriguing
flavourful
beer
give
it
a
shot
overall
great
aroma
big
flavour
easy
drinking
and
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
when
it
could
easily
have
been
could
still
treat
this
like
a
dessert
beer
though
it
gives
a
delightful
sense
of
sticky
toffee
pudding
coffee
coloured
under
a
moderate
head
that
settles
to
a
full
cap
only
spotty
lace
nose
is
all
burned
caramel
malt
comes
across
as
fairly
sweet
whiff
of
alcohol
and
indeed
sweet
to
taste
with
some
sort
of
interesting
funky
smoky
thing
happening
good
that
way
but
sweetness
means
this
is
just
a
one
off
the
smokefunk
is
what
im
assuming
is
the
juniper
and
that
makes
it
kind
of
an
interesting
brew
despite
the
sweetness
noticeable
alcohol
as
you
go
worth
a
try
but
be
prepared
to
find
your
way
past
the
sugar
to
see
what
else
is
in
there
serving
type
bottle
overall
meh
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
meh
even
for
the
style
very
different
bitterness
on
this
one
very
different
ale
in
general
i
guess
its
a
sahti
rye
is
nice
very
nice
mouthfeel
a
bit
fruity
feel
to
it
quite
a
bit
bitterness
but
nicely
balanced
and
the
malt
gives
very
interesting
new
flavors
that
i
dont
really
resemble
with
beer
or
classic
malt
but
soy
maybe
butterscotch
and
some
leather
feel
to
it
taste
is
really
full
overall
a
really
tasty
balanced
well
made
beer
very
unique
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
this
will
never
be
the
most
popular
of
styles
but
i
think
it
has
its
place
on
a
cold
day
when
you
want
something
besides
a
barleywine
poured
a
brownish
body
some
red
tint
with
voluminous
head
and
lace
and
contains
an
aroma
of
some
sweet
malts
pick
up
a
little
rye
in
there
sweetness
is
carameltoffee
variety
along
with
touch
of
citric
hops
and
that
floral
spicy
juniper
smell
is
noticeable
light
easy
to
drink
body
as
i
get
some
of
the
rye
which
helps
smooth
it
out
and
gives
off
a
touch
of
bread
and
there
is
some
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
the
juniper
is
noticeable
and
adds
a
snap
to
finish
but
the
balance
is
there
and
nothing
is
overpowering
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
warmed
up
ever
so
slightly
as
i
nursed
it
o
im
definitely
glad
i
tried
this
and
would
suggest
you
do
the
same
but
i
will
probably
not
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
still
pretty
cool
no
head
on
a
murky
brown
with
golden
hues
body
aroma
of
dark
fruit
mostly
fig
red
apple
raisin
and
plum
with
some
caramel
and
candy
sugar
as
well
flavors
are
a
little
bittersweet
with
more
dark
fruit
initially
including
sour
cherry
fig
and
raisin
with
a
toffee
chocolate
and
caramel
finish
which
is
more
bitter
and
sharptart
than
sweet
the
base
is
bready
throughout
light
to
moderate
carbonation
with
a
relatively
thick
body
that
coats
the
mouth
nice
to
try
one
of
this
genre
from
the
area
for
which
it
is
known
well
balanced
and
becomes
more
drinkable
as
its
enjoyed
d
a
big
heavy
malty
beer
that
is
bready
and
rustic
in
the
way
that
you
would
expect
a
sahti
to
be
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
but
well
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
overall
although
this
is
different
than
i
expected
after
reading
the
description
on
the
bottle
i
now
see
what
they
meant
the
juniper
was
extremely
subtle
but
i
definitely
see
why
this
a
winter
ale
a
malty
brew
with
a
fairly
light
body
this
beer
delivers
what
it
promises
i
just
wish
the
juniper
was
a
bit
more
pronounced
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
sticks
around
a
little
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
rich
and
malty
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
malt
dark
bread
herbs
and
some
dark
fruit
the
herbal
and
caramel
flavors
are
strong
in
this
brew
it
also
tastes
like
nuts
dark
bread
and
some
dark
fruit
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
syrupy
and
slick
with
lowmoderate

i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
i
liked
it
8

a
bottle
i
think
its
worth
trying
at
that
price
beers
body
is
mediumheavy
to
heavy
bodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
the
result
being
a
mouthfeel
that
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
full
does
not
close
dry
but
there
is
a
bit
of
stickiness
across
the
palate
and
lips
this
is
alright
the
juniper
is
fairly
muted
had
way
better
fresher
american
versions
for
much
cheaper
o
pretty
good
but
nothing
to
fly
to
finland
for
it
is
refreshing
and
simple
overall
i
have
zero
experience
with
the
style
my
first
sahti
i
think
it
is
ok
as
a
beer
no
real
idea
how
it
rates
as
a
sahti
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
but
also
very
smooth
lingering
finish
is
a
little
bit
sweet
and
boozy
and
also
a
little
bitter
nice
beer
very
complex
different
and
interesting
o
very
interesting
flavor
profile
and
aroma
with
so
much
of
the
juniper
presence
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
something
i
would
call
sessionable
conclusion
this
is
a
pretty
awesome
beer
almost
all
the
way
through
the
first
glass
i
wasnt
that
impressed
but
then
the
unique
qualities
of
it
began
to
shine
out
there
are
flavors
and
feels
in
this
beer
that
are
seldom
found
i
recommend
this
if
you
are
the
type
that
is
always
searching
for
new
forms
and
manifestations
of
beer
drier
than
the
smell
lets
on
but
still
very
sweet
theres
some
nice
balancing
toastiness
to
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
surprisingly
astringent
like
gin
with
a
mild
kick
of
alcohol
kicked
in
wonderfully
different
and
remarkably
drinkable
full
bodied
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
poured
into
a
stone
brewery
flute
glass
pours
a
medium
to
dark
ruddy
orange
amber
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
the
slowly
dissipates
into
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
leaving
lacing
nice
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
dark
fruit
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
interesting
mellow
flavor
of
caramel
malt
a
light
sharp
sourness
from
the
rye
and
a
earthy
piney
flavor
from
the
juniper
finishes
with
resiny
juniper
bitterness
and
residual
caramel
malt
somewhat
subdued
flavor
but
very
pleasant
and
interesting
medium
to
full
bodied
a
very
nice
sahti
and
one
i
hope
to
try
again
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
light
tan
two
finger
head
that
has
fairly
nice
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
a
dark
fruit
mixture
on
top
of
a
spicy
rye
malt
and
some
aroma
of
dry
campfire
wood
flavor
is
ginlike
from
the
juniper
twigs
at
first
and
morphs
into
an
earthy
noble
hopspiced
rye
note
that
sweetens
up
in
the
finish
to
more
of
a
standard
caramel
malt
profile
the
rye
falls
away
from
the
barley
albeit
with
tannic
and
gin
accents
throughout
luscious
smooth
and
heavy
mouthfeel
lightly
carbonated
truly
an
excellent
sahti
remarkable
for
being
so
dark
and
rich
compared
to
other
sahtis
ive
had
this
one
is
a
musttry
if
you
can
locate
a
bottle
easy
to
consume
from
a
pint
glass
this
worked
well
as
a
sipper
and
equally
well
with
a
steak
finish
is
a
bit
hot
and
pepperminty
but
not
really
has
that
herbal
spice
to
it
the
juniper
cannot
be
ignored
and
the
reveal
is
arctic
circle
ale
by
malmgårdin
panimo
style
is
actually
a
sahti
not
a
barleywine
whoops
very
nice
beer
and
a
want
definitely
reminded
me
of
a
barleywine
as
i
got
a
lot
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
i
didnt
get
any
juniper
berries
at
all
which
is
a
good
thing
as
i
normally
dont
like
that
in
a
beer
too
much
very
cool
thanks

9

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
i
think
this
is
a
nice
sahtitype
beer
im
no
huge
fan
of
sahti
so
i
dont
get
specially
excited
from
this
either
sahti
fans
like
this
probably
very
much
that
i
can
say
medium
body
here
and
this
is
a
mostly
still
beer
very
light
carbonation
is
noticeable
on
the
finish
a
lot
going
on
here
this
is
also
my
first
of
the
style
this
is
enjoyable
but
i
dont
see
how
often
i
would
want
to
drink
something
to
this
nature
good
for
a
change
of
pace
and
i
wouldnt
mind
sampling
some
other
sahtis
pouring
out
like
a
still
beer
hmmmm
wondering
if
theres
a
problem
no
head
at
all
got
some
molasses
on
the
nose
and
of
all
things
brennivin
the
black
death
national
drink
of
iceland
yeah
go
figure
i
like
the
flavor
but
it
seems
muted
my
second
sahti
dfh
being
the
first
and
that
beer
was
friggin
over
the
top
im
going
to
let
it
warm
a
bit
and
see
what
happens
well
not
alot
of
change
after
waiting
10
minutes
or
so
its
decent
and
im
enjoying
it
but
if
i
find
yet
another
sahti
to
try
ill
move
on
no
need
to
come
back
to
this
one
definitely
not
as
herbal
and
raw
as
the
other
that
i
have
had
seems
more
like
a
wheat
old
ale
needs
more
juniper
at
a
minimum
this
is
my
first
sahti
style
ale
but
it
was
quite
enjoyable
the
flavor
profiles
described
in
the
style
guidelines
seem
to
be
all
present
in
this
ale
i
would
have
like
the
juniper
to
come
out
a
little
more
but
other
than
that
this
beer
was
really
good
beer
is
nice
overall
interesting
sweet
up
front
a
little
dry
on
the
back
almost
a
peat
quality
to
it
earthiness
mild
spice
a
good
little
beer
id
like
to
try
it
again
some
day
poured
a
fairlydart
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
receded
quickly
without
leaving
too
much
lacing
the
nose
carried
a
bit
of
juniper
and
darker
malts
plus
a
faint
herbal
quality
flavor
has
a
touch
of
roast
and
some
darkened
malt
plus
juniper
and
miscellaneous
spicing
not
over
the
top
in
any
direction
lightmedium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
pretty
nice
brew
do
rated
to
style
after
trying
arctic
circle
ale
its
no
wonder
its
currently
the
number
one
rated
sahti
in
the
world
this
was
my
only
want
on
ba
for
the
longest
time
and
i
just
stumbled
upon
it
at
a
binnys
last
weekend
d
it
seems
like
every
sahti
i
have
is
quite
different
and
this
one
is
no
exception
quite
enjoyable
although
the
500ml
bottle
would
probably
be
best
split
between
two
people
if
you
like
ryewines
give
this
one
a
shot
i
appreciate
the
delicate
touch
with
the
juniper
too
im
a
fan
of
juniper
and
therefore
of
sahti
not
a
lot
of
examples
around
so
its
nice
to
find
one
i
havent
tried
this
one
is
billed
as
having
been
brewed
with
juniper
branches
pours
a
slightly
murky
brown
with
a
medium
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
smells
malty
but
with
a
delicate
juniper
note
the
taste
is
nice
very
malty
and
with
a
little
bit
of
a
vinous
fruity
note
perhaps
prunes
and
a
nice
note
of
juniper
clean
and
light
in
the
mouth
not
the
resinous
explosion
of
juniper
im
looking
for
but
very
pleasant
nonetheless
and
it
is
billed
as
an
arctic
ale
rather
than
as
a
traditional
sahti
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
redish
looking
ale
with
some
darker
brown
shadows
in
it
the
lacing
is
pretty
good
the
smell
is
very
herbal
and
has
a
little
bit
of
an
earthy
booze
aroma
too
the
taste
to
me
seemed
a
lot
more
like
a
barley
wine
than
anything
else
to
me
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thick
but
not
oily
the
overall
take
i
have
on
this
is
that
it
really
wasnt
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
glad
i
tried
it
but
found
it
to
be
a
little
too
much
for
me
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
caramel
and
toffee
malt
i
dont
get
the
juniper
in
the
aroma
that
being
said
the
juniper
is
present
in
the
flavor
i
also
get
some
smoked
malt
and
and
toffee
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
all
of
the
flavors
meld
well
together
and
make
an
enjoyable
beer
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
taste
is
spicy
fruits
with
caramlised
rich
toast
raisin
woodyspicy
bitterness
with
some
balancing
sweetness
the
spicywoody
bitterness
just
dominating
the
finish
and
a
bit
too
sharp
and
lingering
though
fairly
fullbodied
with
some
good
flavour
it
ends
up
being
almost
onedimensional
dominated
by
a
fairly
flat
caramelised
toast
character
with
woodyspicy
bitterness
its
good
but
not
great
and
is
less
unique
in
character
than
id
expected
if
you
like
rye
beers
or
odd
flavors
this
one
is
both
intriguing
and
well
made
im
at
a
loss
for
words
to
describe
how
odd
it
is
but
thoroughly
drinkable
it
would
be
worth
comparing
with
other
juniper
flavored
beers
i
definitely
want
to
try
this
again
and
ill
be
looking
to
see
if
there
are
any
others
in
this
style
out
there
o
a
very
unique
taste
really
cannot
compare
it
to
any
other
beer
that
i
have
tried
might
be
able
to
drink
two
at
one
sitting
verdict
decent
and
unique
but
a
little
pricey
d
this
is
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
because
the
juniper
flavors
do
not
overwhelm
the
palate
pours
a
creamy
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
turns
into
lace
rich
yeast
herbal
aroma
very
close
to
a
belgian
brown
ale
sweet
a
little
gummy
the
juniper
twigs
come
through
nicely
as
well
very
pleasant
aroma
pretty
full
body
very
smooth
the
juniper
twigs
really
come
through
in
the
flavor
but
its
definitely
not
a
bad
thing
its
almost
a
nice
replacement
of
the
hops
which
you
can
hardly
taste
theres
a
noticeable
sour
taste
but
it
comes
second
to
the
juniper
as
if
to
compliment
it
very
nice
it
almost
create
its
own
herbal
bitterness
this
beer
is
nice
because
its
not
a
belgian
beer
but
has
elements
of
one
i
definitely
like
this
brew
a
lot
the
scandinavians
definitely
have
a
way
with
herbal
drinks
very
enjoyable
if
you
can
find
this
try
it
it
is
awesome
mouthfeel
is
much
heavier
than
i
was
prepared
for
but
i
enjoy
that
especially
on
a
chilly
rainy
night
such
as
this
i
have
seen
this
before
and
merely
passed
by
it
im
very
glad
i
chose
to
try
it
out
while
definitely
strange
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
everything
is
balanced
perfectly
for
me
and
it
goes
down
way
too
smooth
considering
the
7
9
abv
yeah
heavy
but
it
has
all
the
right
flavours
and
in
good
proportions
an
interesting
style
to
which
i
have
no
comparison
point
but
its
a
nice
beer
anyway
very
interesting
brew
ive
not
had
a
dark
sahti
before
but
i
can
see
now
that
it
works
sahti
seems
like
such
an
odd
style
to
me
but
every
time
i
have
one
i
get
more
and
more
enamoured
with
it
taste
a
nice
warming
maltiness
with
more
juniper
flavor
then
the
smell
hints
the
hoppiness
tends
to
distract
from
the
beer
for
my
personal
taste
but
an
overall
excellent
winter
beer
even
if
its
not
quite
winter
yet
d
a
bit
of
a
change
of
pace
for
me
i
havent
had
a
winter
warmer
for
a
while
this
one
was
almost
like
an
imaginary
blend
of
anchor
osa
and
the
aforementioned
avery
old
jubilation
quite
an
interesting
brew
even
in
the
heat
of
late
september
different
than
i
expected
and
much
different
than
another
juniper
beer
ive
had
this
one
reminds
me
of
a
softer
easier
chewy
porter
or
stout
poured
with
a
fine
light
tan
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
cover
and
some
lace
color
is
a
a
cloudy
brown
with
dark
amber
highlights
aroma
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
rye
fruit
roasty
and
the
juniper
flavor
is
the
same
but
with
lots
more
going
on
roast
comes
out
more
very
well
balanced
texture
is
like
i
said
chewy
and
full
with
great
carbonation
nice
finish
session
drinkability
good
d
ok
drinkability
warming
with
a
wintery
booziness
and
dried
sweetness
ones
enough
though
at
any
given
sitting
the
flavor
was
good
enough
but
just
about
every
other
aspect
was
barely
above
par
all
in
all
a
unique
concoction
that
has
elements
of
some
american
amber
ales
as
well
as
some
components
of
an
english
bitter
all
filtered
through
a
finnish
prism
subtle
but
worth
seeking
out
dark
reddish
brown
color
and
a
massive
dense
light
tan
head
that
lasts
light
does
not
pass
through
this
beer
sweet
and
peppery
smell
carmel
molasses
rye
and
spicey
pepper
i
would
bet
from
the
juniper
are
the
most
notable
scents
that
i
detect
very
smooth
texture
and
nice
low
carbonation
great
blend
of
bitter
spice
to
counteract
the
sweetness
taste
very
much
reflects
the
aroma
ive
had
these
types
of
beers
before
when
they
were
too
sweet
and
syrupy
and
this
beer
does
an
excellent
job
of
avoiding
those
characteristics
a
little
alcohol
warmth
is
present
after
it
goes
down
the
throat
very
good
beer
significantly
better
than
the
last
suomi
beer
i
had
d
the
nice
caramel
flavor
taste
like
the
wort
had
a
long
boil
with
some
nice
spice
finish
that
is
not
hoppy
but
balances
the
sweetness
nicely
unique
and
delicious
its
a
malty
winter
warmer
with
a
sahti
spicing
influence
a
great
sipper
to
have
on
hand
in
the
winter
abv
shows
just
enough
to
give
it
a
warming
touch
that
is
welcomed
look
for
this
one
for
a
winter
treat
d
i
was
honestly
a
touch
disappointed
when
i
first
started
this
too
fizzy
and
too
subdued
in
its
flavor
as
it
warmed
and
breathed
however
it
got
much
better
overall
it
comes
across
to
me
as
a
sahtirye
beer
hybrid
thats
quite
unique
a
fine
winter
pickup
arctic
circle
ale
is
damn
good
beer
and
has
a
finnish
sahti
vibe
that
is
irresistible
its
a
sad
shame
that
this
brewerys
lineup
isnt
more
widely
available
and
less
expensive
since
they
clearly
know
their
way
around
a
mash
tun
recommended
sweet
malty
and
spicy
with
a
tinge
of
juniper
i
really
like
juniper
and
sahti
so
i
just
wish
that
there
was
a
stronger
juniper
character
if
anything
the
beer
pours
a
purplish
brown
translucent
but
quite
dark
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
malty
with
notes
of
hops
and
juniper
its
more
along
the
lines
of
an
english
strong
ale
with
a
bit
of
holiday
spice
the
malt
has
a
really
nice
flavor
like
a
good
barleywine
there
are
fruit
notes
raspberries
and
plums
mixed
with
brown
sugar
and
rum
the
juniper
is
light
and
woody
the
hops
or
maybe
its
just
bitterness
from
the
juniper
twigs
are
relatively
strong
theres
a
fair
bite
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
a
very
enjoyable
little
nightcap
m
d
a
nice
full
body
its
even
a
bit
chewy
it
has
a
bit
of
a
thick
feel
going
down
which
is
slightly
exaggerated
by
a
soft
warming
of
alcohol
an
interesting
brew
though
i
cant
quite
place
it
into
a
specific
style
category
drinkability
is
good
here
too
even
though
this
is
a
7
3er
it
has
a
great
finish
and
makes
you
want
more
right
away
d
very
drinkable
if
it
werent
11
a
bottle
it
would
be
part
of
my
regular
rotation
way
to
go
finland
d
overall
this
beer
was
ok
but
nothing
special
i
thought
the
taste
was
a
little
bland
and
lacking
and
the
bitterness
wasnt
that
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
look
to
try
this
again
m
d
a
lightermedium
sparkling
body
with
a
refreshing
semidry
finish
one
of
the
better
offerings
i
have
come
across
from
south
street
in
recent
memory
its
a
shame
it
is
a
seasonal
offering
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
very
different
from
what
i
remember
the
juniper
is
much
more
pronounced
here
than
it
used
to
be
at
least
iirc
and
its
an
interesting
tastingsmelling
combination
if
not
crazy
complexbalanced
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
an
interesting
brew
a
sahti
with
a
winter
character
unique
this
one
has
a
winning
flavor
and
nose
but
needs
work
on
the
carbonation
and
head
issues
NA
o
my
first
experience
of
the
style
but
based
on
the
flavour
profile
and
mouthfeel
and
the
ba
description
with
the
exception
of
abv
i
certainly
feel
that
this
brew
lives
up
to
the
true
characteristics
of
the
style
a
pleasure
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
as
mentioned
my
first
of
the
style
so
have
no
reference
point
to
compare
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
and
therefore
has
become
my
personal
measuring
stick
overall
for
my
first
go
at
the
sahti
style
this
is
definitely
a
refreshing
brew
with
a
pleasant
juniper
berry
pepperiness
and
a
spicy
hop
profile
good
on
wild
rose
for
expanding
their
profile
from
my
limited
experience
with
the
style
and
one
of
them
was
from
dogfish
head
which
as
much
as
ya
gotta
love
them
wasnt
all
that
adherent
to
traditional
style
despite
their
effective
marketing
to
the
contrary
it
seems
like
the
fictional
albertan
midnight
son
did
well
in
dredging
up
the
goods
in
suomi
what
comes
after
that
is
simply
a
pleasant
assembly
of
the
constituent
ingredients
and
a
small
tickers
orgasm
can
now
be
heard
murmuring
across
wild
roses
distribution
area
gotta
give
wildrose
props
for
trying
new
things
and
this
was
an
interesting
brew
that
left
me
a
little
confused
im
going
to
remember
this
one
because
ive
now
tried
every
style
of
beer
listed
on
ba
it
could
be
a
world
class
version
of
a
sahti
for
all
i
know
NA
NA
body
seems
rather

to
me
quite

and
creamy

heres
where
i
get
some
caramelized

its
an
interesting
brew
to
be
sure
wickedly
different
from
wild
roses
recent
take
on
the
style
brewed
with
weizen
yeast
for
a
radically
different
flavor
insert
cross
reference
here
and
i
am
left
wondering
if
anyone
here
in
this
country
truly
knows
what
a
sahti
tastes
like
i
certainly
do
not
not
with
any
real
degree
of
certainty
doesnt
really
matter
if
these
attempts
enrich
our
beer
scene

is
what
it
takes
to
be
a
veritable
sahti
then
a
veritable
sahti
this
is
more
westcoast
ipa
or
esb
i
know
in
its
overall
bearing
the
extra
ingredient
is
like
the
pea
to
the
storybook
princess
not
all
that
detectable
at
first
but
somehow
you
just
cant
help
noticing
it
after
a
strangely
short
amount
of
time
worthy
of
checking
out
if
youre
into
what
native
suomi
are
all
about
sahti
was
the
last
style
i
tried
on
ba
and
it
took
me
over
5
years
to
find
my
first
and
only
a
couple
months
to
find
a
second
both
were
from
western
canada
strangely
enough
im
keeping
my
eyes
out
for
a
classic
finnish
version
o
good
beer
wellbalanced
the
juniper
really
works
well
with
the
hop
flavor
not
much
malt
flavor
in
there
which
is
fine
it
seemed
a
little
light
for
having
7
7
alc
not
a
typical
sahti
this
is
a
hopped
up
pnw
version
of
the
finnish
style
the
higher
abv
and
the
big
hops
make
this
taste
more
like
a
dipa
the
juniper
comes
up
in
the
nose
and
the
finish
but
mostly
this
a
tasty
ipa
that
has
some
darker
undercurrents
from
the
sahti
profile
im
sure
it
is
not
to
style
but
the
original
style
is
normally
infected
and
brewed
with
juniper
branches
so
given
that
i
say
this
is
a
welldone
beer
mouthfeel
is
intersting
almost
thick
and
oily
but
balanced
with
the
intense
dense
carbonation
o
very
complex
and
intriguing
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
and
is
well
worth
the
price
serving
type

overall
decent
nice
balance

and
acidic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of

on
the
palate
with
each

this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty
refreshing
and
quite
sour
the
high
abv
is
not
detectable
at
all
i
could
see
this
growing
on
some
as
they
drink
it
but
this
had
me
from
the
moment
i
smelled
it
thank
you
bourbonbob
for
sharing
very
very
neat
beer
here
unlike
anything
ive
encountered
before
apparently
fermented
in
an
old
hollowed
out
tree
trunk
thats
the
word
and
its
very
cool
if
its
true
the
beer
ha
cloudy
but
bright
just
darker
than
golden
with
a
fluffy
and
lasting
muted
white
head
lots
going
on
with
the
nose
from
intense
pine
tree
aromas
to
softer
birch
syrup
and
floral
notes
its
different
almost
ancient
or
medicinal
or
for
some
other
healing
or
ceremonial
purpose
than
beer
it
just
has
that
vibe
the
flavors
are
even
more
alive
than
the
nose
with
a
spruce
or
pine
complex
taking
the
lead
but
an
interesting
wood
profile
too
that
isnt
oak
its
much
more
musty
and
less
familiar
the
yeast
is
also
unconventional
not
sure
if
its
brett
or
not
but
it
definitely
has
some
funkiness
massive
body
and
carbonation
levels
makes
this
extremely
strong
beer
seem
like
a
session
ale
its
remarkable
how
much
of
an
afterthought
the
booze
is
for
me
here
its
just
so
interesting
i
never
notice
it
there
at
all
although
im
not
sure
its
particularly
well
hidden
i
love
beer
that
is
new
to
me
that
brings
something
else
to
the
table
that
reinvents
what
we
all
think
we
know
beer
to
taste
like
this
is
one
of
those
beers
once
in
a
life
time
mix
of
flavors
what
a
treat
overall
this
is
worldclass
not
sure
it
is
a
beer
that
can
tickle
anyones
fancy
but
the
use
of
spruce
fresh
wine
barrels
hops
and
yeast
selection
make
for
an
effervescent
drinking
delight
a
nice
sourness
that
can
please
sour
heads
juicy
citrus
hop
character
that
would
appeal
to
hopheads
and
spritzy
body
that
can
get
the
attention
of
cider
and
champagne
drinkers
alike
beware
though
as
the
spruce
is
definitely
upfront
and
lends
an
astringent
woodsy
character
not
like
oak
that
is
the
one
detail
that
could
turn
some
off
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
effervescence
of
carbonation
initially
this
was
a
little
hard
to
stomach
with
a
borderline
abrasive
pinesolvent
nose
but
as
it
warmed
up
and
breathed
it
really
grew
on
me
overall
a
world
class
beer
ale
apothecary
killed
it
overall
another
fantastic
beer
from
taa
very
unique
and
high
quality
stuff
o
very
unique
the
flavors
are
well
matched
together
overall
easily
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
really
good
and
like
nothing
ive
had
before
o
a
ton
of
pine
flavors
form
the
spruce
tips
that
were
used
in
brewing
this
very
refreshing
and
even
with
all
of
the
pine
i
would
have
this
one
again
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
age
and
see
how
this
one
develops
overall
its
okaythe
sweetness
really
sticks
around
when
you
dont
want
it
to
but
theres
certainly
some
interesting
stuff
going
on
at
the
very
least
its
another
beer
that
proves
once
again
after
divine
manchu
last
year
that
young
henrys
dont
do
gabs
by
halves
and
thats
a
great
thing

not
my
style
great
label
average
beer
very
drinkable
but
unlikely
to
make
it
a
point
to
purchase
this
beer
again
taste
is
a
little
more
on
the
grainy
rye
end
of
the
spectrum
with
more
bubblegum
yeast
steamrolling
in
not
sure
where
the
juniper
comes
in
to
be
honest
but
i
trust
its
a
component
in
the
mix
medium
bodied
lightly
sweet
at
first
and
finishing
dry
overall
worth
a
try
would
have
liked
more
juniper
flavor
but
a
drinkable
clean
beer
nonetheless
i
am
mistaken
o
my
first
time
having
a
sahti
and
i
gotta
say
i
like
it
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
ipas
and
stouts
that
i
love
so
much
this
is
a
nice
chill
beer
i
think
it
would
be
great
with
a
ceasar
salad
or
an
olive
oil
based
pasta
dish
speaking
of
salad
would
probably
make
a
great
vinaigrette
this
is
a
nice
delve
into
the
style
and
i
will
look
for
more

style
i
dont
know
much
about
but
if
this
is
a

then
i
may
avoid
it
as
id
much
rather
be
drinking
a
stout
or
ipa
the
vikings
may
have
enjoyed
it
but
with
the
current
craft
beer
movement
id
rather
spend
my
time
on
better
styles
me
and
my
friend
were
required
to
brew
a
sahti
for
a
home
brew
competition
we
were
entering
so
we
saw
this
on
the
shelf
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
i
must
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
awful
it
pours
in
a
dark
gold
murky
color
that
is
somewhere
in
between
good
and
ugly
i
really
did
not
like
the
smell
it
was
funky
as
hell
mediumlow
head
which
is
actually
too
much
head
for
this
style
which
is
supposed
to
be
served
flat
taste
was
of
malty
juniper
with
maybe
a
little
spice
from
some
rye
grain
it
was
surprisingly
refreshing
and
left
a
clean
feeling
in
your
mouth
this
beer
goes
down
super
easy
for
something
with
a
7
abv
there
are
some
subtle
hops
detected
i
think
a
noble
verity
which
i
enjoyed
and
obviously
increased
the
shelf
life
but
again
traditionally
there
is
supposed
to
be
no
hops
and
the
beer
drank
within
a
month
after
it
is
brewed
but
i
realize
that
would
be
a
money
losing
endeavor
for
anywhere
outside
finland
also
i
think
the
flavor
got
better
as
the
beer
warmed
give
this
beer
a
try
it
is
totally
different
and
pretty
good
o
certainly
an
odd
duck
of
a
beer
but
i
liked
it
im
not
sure
if
i
will
be
buying
it
again
but
i
am
really
glad
i
triedreviewed
it
overall
this
is
a
tasty
mix
consisting
of
a
sorta
amber
ale
and
oaky
gin
boozy
brew
that
really
warms
you
even
while
only
at
7
abv
a
very
interesting
and
rather
enjoyable
brew
o
interesting
brew
taste
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
utopias
wouldnt
have
this
one
frequently
but
nonetheless
would
have
it
again
the
aroma
was
mostly
sweet
malts
with
a
light
spicepine
scent
the
taste
was
nearly
identical
but
the
spiciness
seemed
a
bit
more
noticeable
the
body
was
nicely
full
although
a
bit
sticky
drinkability
was
ok
but
this
would
be
1
at
a
time
beer
for
me
mostly
due
to
the
sweetness
overall
a
nice
enough
example
would
probably
be
a
decent
introductory
brew
overall
its
an
okay
brew
a
bit
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
so
glad
i
chose
to
enjoy
it
now
the
only
other
sahti
ive
had
is
dfhs
sahtea
and
i
definitely
liked
that
one
better
overall
a
rather
disappointing
sampling
from
sam
adams
its
the
first
sahti
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
so
i
cant
completely
rate
to
style
but
this
seemed
to
lack
the
body
and
the
tartness
that
supposedly
comes
with
this
style
based
on
my
guess
at
the
bottling
date
i
am
over
a
year
late
to
this
beer
so
if
i
found
fresh
bottle
i
might
try
it
fresh
to
see
if
it
was
any
better
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
foamy
head
and
some
persistent
lacing
nose
is
sweet
characteristics
only
with
very
little
malt
or
grain
earthy
with
sweet
raisin
bitter
licorice
and
a
noteworthy
whiskey
flavor
syrupy
and
thick
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
a
bit
of
woody
taste
a
bit
earthy
a
bit
of
bite
at
the
end
from
the
citrus
and
maybe
a
bit
of
frozen
alcohol
since
it
was
frozen
from
what
i
can
tell
it
seems
pretty
good
and
i
would
try
it
again
but
maybe
next
time
with
one
that
does
not
explode
in
a
bath
of
foam
all
over
the
table
and
computer
nearby
then
i
may
be
able
to
more
faithfully
review
it
overall
glad
i
bought
and
tried
it
and
would
try
again
o
an
interesting
and
solid
beer
overall
sahtis
are
hardly
my
specialty
so
its
difficult
to
compare
it
to
other
examples
of
the
style
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
have
to
include
this
in
the
rotation
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
as
you
pour
it
out
is
the
sharp
aroma
of
brandy
strong
and
sweet
with
plenty
of
fruit
undertones
raisins
and
light
breads
smells
also
come
through
and
there
is
that
slight
definitive
smell
of
alcohol
it
pours
out
a
dark
murky
brown
color
and
is
topped
off
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
forms
a
small
ring
around
the
glass
the
lacing
is
thin
but
very
covers
every
inch
of
the
glass
it
taste
is
rather
surprising
its
light
and
tart
very
refreshing
it
bitter
around
the
edges
of
the
mouth
and
you
can
pick
up
some
woody
flavors
mild
berries
this
is
a
very
refreshing
find
and
ill
definitely
be
buying
this
one
again
bottle
opens
with
a
huge
crack
and
bubbles
immediately
try
to
escape
luckily
my
cat
like
reflexes
got
the
bottle
top
into
the
glass
before
any
product
was
wasted
deep
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
huge
off
white
head
that
takes
forever
to
recede
the
aroma
is
spicy
no
shit
huh
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
much
different
from
a
belgian
strong
dark
honestly
dark
caramelized
and
brown
sugars
with
some
dark
fruit
and
a
virtual
spice
rack
of
aromas
that
range
from
nutmeg
to
coriander
to
mint
juniper
berries
perhaps
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
lots
of
dark
sugary
flavor
theres
an
earthy
spicy
woody
component
in
there
that
i
can
only
assume
comes
from
juniper
somehow
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
light
syrups
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
brew
but
honestly
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
is
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
and
is
rather
enjoyable
in
the
winter
if
youre
a
dark
beer
lover
or
samuel
adams
fan
give
this
one
a
shot
you
wont
be
disappointed

overall
its

but
better
than
expected
ive
only
had
1
other
sahti
to
compare
this
to
so
its
a
tough
style
for
comparison
purposes
as
a
beer
its
weird
but
not
too
bad
at
all
ive
got
friends
in
finland
so
i
was
very
interested
in
trying
this
one
i
get
what
they
were
going
for
here
but
it
definitely
isnt
authentic
as
far
as
ingredients
go
but
i
can
look
past
that
odfhs
was
better
balance
needs
to
be
improved
but
still
then
nothing
in
this
beer
sticks
out
taste
is
like
a
sour
version
of
an
irish
red
ale
actually
very
off
putting
i
was
expecting
something
more
ginlike
this
tastes
like
it
was
dredged
up
from
a
thousand
year
old
viking
ship
caveat
to
the
reader
i
never
drank
a
sahti
before
so
i
may
not
be
the
best
guide
to
this
brew
but
this
brew
makes
me
sure
not
to
drink
one
again
d
im
not
sure
where
the
sahti
character
was
since
no
juniper
was
really
noticeable
the
scent
and
taste
were
like
a
red
ale
or
oktoberfest
not
unpleasant
at
all
but
way
off
for
the
style
and
therefore
disappointing
did
i
just
sit
on
this
too
long
and
all
the
uniqueness
already
faded
its
an
easy
drinker
with
a
unique
flavor

i
really
enjoyed

this
beer
definitely
gets
better
as
it

im
not
sure
how
authentic
a

it
is
though
there
was
zero
sediment
in
my
bottle
i
havent
had
a
sahti
before
that
i
can
remember
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
the
style
i
was
expecting
something
more
rustic
cloudy
and
more
complex
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
really
need
to
have
this

nh
o
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
of
my
first
sahti
but
i
think
i
like
it
would
drink
again
had
some
at
my
parents
for
the
holidays
the
drink
had
a
dark
brownamber
appearance
with
a
decent
head
that
became
thin
lacing
eventually
aromas
had
a
solid
malt
flavor
with
some
vanilla
and
bread
hints
the
drink
was
tasty
with
a
strong
butter
flavor
and
a
slight
cherry
aftertaste
medium
body
and
decently
creamy
overall
pretty
good
for
the
holidays
well
this
is
a
conundrum
beer
for
me
do
i
rate
this
as
for
what
the
brewer
intended
or
do
i
rate
it
as
to
whether
i
like
the
beer
in
respect
for
this
website
i
will
rate
as
brewer
intended
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sahti
style
beers
the
beer
poured
clear
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
scent
is
a
very
i
nice
breeze
of
berries
the
taste
is
very
fruity
perhaps
the
reason
the
vikings
averted
scurvy
there
is
a
nice
malt
base
that
balances
the
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
decent
a
little
to
fruity
for
me
but
solid
offering
by
sammy
a
a
nice
start
to
my
3
day
weekend
onothing
special
here
reminded
me
of
a
reddish
amber
with
a
hint
of
berries
in
the
background
will
only
buy
again
if
on
sale
and
then
only
for
aging
o
this
is
certainly
not
one
of
the
better
of
the
small
batch
series
produced
by
boston
beer
company
the
absence
of
other
spice
components
make
this
fairly
basic
and
onedimensional
the
yeast
used
here
isnt
very
interesting
as
well
not
enough
funkiness
i
dont
know
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
juniper
and
pine
character
where
all
i
got
was
a
strong
malt
sweetness
overall
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
something
i
would
look
at
as
more
of
a
scottish
ale
or
even
a
wee
heavy
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
its
tasty
would
i
consider
this
a
fine
example
of
the
sahti
style
no
at
least
based
on
the
style
description
on
ba
i
find
very
little
in
this
beer
that
fits
that
profile
maybe
norse
legend
sahti
doesnt
meet
my
expectations
of
what
the
beer
should
be
its
still
a
nice
beverage
to
kick
back
with
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
although
i
think
i
like
it
more
for
its
novelty
than
as
something
id
want
regularly
the
juniper
creates
a
good
bitterness
but
the
overall
woodiness
is
a
bit
much
for
any
kind
of
session
drinking
overall
drinkability
ive
never
had
a
sahti
before
so
its
hard
to
rate
this
one
on
style
if
i
read
the
beer
advocate
description
is
has
some
features
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
juniper
but
not
others
turbidity
in
appearance
so
let
me
instead
state
what
i
think
of
this
as
a
beer
the
juniper
works
well
as
a
hop
substitute
although
there
are
times
where
i
think
im
drinking
a
beer
spiked
with
gin
could
be
im
not
a
big
fan
of
juniper
nice
looking
beer
feels
good
going
down
not
really
great
in
taste
and
smell
interesting
yes
a
great
beer
no
drinkability
i
could
not
finish
off
the
bomber
myself
even
over
2
hours
corked
the
bottle
and
kept
it
in
the
fridge
while
i
finished
the
first
glass
and
so
one
big
glass
is
more
than
enough
i
think
i
would
give
the
style
a
try
again
but
with
food
and
not
this
particular
beer
again
a
good
beer
to
try
but
not
good
for
a
repeat
strong
ale
with
juniper
that
is
all
we
have
here
no
rawness
or
tart
character
refined
and
too
sweet
i
want
to
cook
with
this
beer
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
i
want
to
drink
it
its
an
interesting
beer
i
only
have
one
other
example
of
the
style
to
compare
to
so
its
hard
to
say
whether
this
is
a
great
sahti
or
not
however
its
certainly
tasty
in
my
glass
my
first
new
rating
for
a
sam
adams
in
a
long
time
big
fan
of
the
company
and
the
presentation
of
the
small
batch
collection
pack
not
a
bad
beer
overall
i
may
have
homered
it
a
little
bit
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
mediumintensity
carbonation
that
results
in
a
slightly
prickly
at
first
but
quickly
foamy
and
smooth
afterwards
closes
semidryly
o
im
glad
i
was
introduced
to
this
style
of
beer
after
doing
my
research
i
learned
that
sam
adams
did
a
few
things
differently
in
the
brewing
process
than
people
who
have
made
more
traditional
sahti
using
juniper
berries
instead
of
branches
and
hopping
the
beer
im
not
saying
this
is
a
bad
method
because
im
sure
it
is
much
more
conventional
for
mass
production
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
a
more
traditional
sahti
someday
i
like
norse
legend
it
is
nothing
spectacular
but
it
is
a
fine
tasting
beer
it
has
also
reminded
me
that
there
is
so
much
out
there
that
i
dont
even
know
and
that
my
beer
tasting
journey
has
barely
begun
o
overall
not
bad
but
this
beer
was
lacking
a
little
for
me
you
cant
fault
the
way
boston
makes
all
the
elements
work
and
packages
this
with
nice
foam
and
beery
substance
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
litickers
in
san
diego
update
opened
a
bottle
that
was
six
months
old
from
purchase
date
this
has
mellowed
quite
a
bit
and
the
ginlike
component
is
pretty
subdued
still
present
but
more
an
afterthought
than
it
was
sweet
and
malty
flavors
carameltoffee
more
forward
sweet
but
not
stickysweet
still
a
decent
beer
to
drink
in
my
opinion
but
id
rather
have
it
fresh
with
the
juniper
more
prominent
more
brown
in
color
versus
original
notes
d
not
as
awful
as
it
could
have
been
not
as
great
as
it
could
have
been
either
i
would
have
liked
more
juniper
and
less
metallic
taste
a
bit
on
the
boozy
sweet
side
so
not
exactly
sessionable
overall
not
mind
blowing
but
certainly
not
terrible
an
interesting
style
and
worth
a
repeat
sampling
o
the
malt
and
the
juniper
remind
me
of
a
christmas
beer
o
as
above
i
expected
this
to
be
much
more
in
your
face
smacked
with
a
tree
type
of
thing
im
glad
it
was
not
my
first
sip
impression
was
not
so
bad
witch
for
something
off
the
beaten
trail
can
be
an
ok
impression
i
wish
my
attempted
at
a
gruit
had
rated
that
high
i
find
this
an
enjoyable
beer
i
would
not
have
more
than
one
in
a
night
and
i
may
never
grab
this
again
but
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
my
friends
i
would
say
treat
it
like
a
barley
wine
a
sipper
around
the
fire
split
with
a
friend
cold
winter
night
kind
of
thing
intensely
sugary
sweet
molasses
brown
sugar
figs
ginger
and
only
a
modicum
of
juniper
aroma
with
a
nuance
of
buttermilk
and
leafy
hop
aroma
on
the
side
hmm
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
juniper
wood
in
the
nose
than
this
the
flavor
however
has
some
of
that
woody
splintery
bite
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
sahtis
unfortunately
its
just
too
pastrydoughsweet
overall
for
the
herbal
and
leafy
hopping
to
match
for
my
personal
tastes
and
to
reiterate
not
to
style
but
a
nice
stab
at
making
it
perhaps
more
approachable
to
a
less
exploratory
populace

light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
syrupy
feel
overall
this
doesnt
come
off
so
much
as
a
sahti
to
me
rather
a
spruceflavored
amber
ale
or
something
either
way
it
aint
that
great
overall
an
interesting
malty
beer
honestly
i
cant
imagine
any
reputable
norseman
characterizing
this
beer
as
legendary
its
just
okay
in
about
every
respect
frankly
the
flavor
needs
something
to
liven
it
up
a
bit
if
youre
looking
to
simply
try
a
sahti
its
worth
grabbing
a
bottle
there
are
far
better
representations
of
the
style
though
overall
this
brew
my
first
of
this
style
is
rather
peculiar
the
taste
is
almost
offputting
at
first
but
as
it
warms
up
and
i
get
used
to
it
it
becomes
rather
enjoyable
overall
this
is
good
fare
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
sam
adams
limited
release
series
i
did
wish
for
a
bit
more
body
and
potency
in
the
beer
the
7
abv
and
the
concomitant
lower
sugar
levels
making
for
less
strength
and
more
wateriness
than
i
would
have
preferred
still
the
flavors
here
are
unique
and
nicely
developed
offering
excellent
interplay
and
nuance
worth
trying
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
one
of
sam
adams
better
beers
because
it
is
interesting
and
i
enjoy
drinking
beers
that
arent
really
traditional
beers
in
the
german
sense
of
the
word
and
it
was
great
to
finally
get
to
try
it
on
draft
i
remember
about
five
years
ago
they
had
it
on
rotation
but
i
was
never
able
to
try
it
there
are
so
many
other
beers
out
there
that
i
have
to
try
and
my
regular
drinking
beers
ipas
mostly
so
im
not
sure
ill
be
drinking
it
again
but
maybe
if
it
goes
away
ill
miss
it
and
want
to
try
it
again
next
time
around
o
my
first
sahti
and
i
feel
that
this
may
not
have
done
an
adequate
job
of
defining
the
style
it
seems
a
lot
more
like
a
belgian
double
or
a
quad
than
anything
else
enjoyable
overall
i
am
totally
unimpressed
with
this
one
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
the
mouthfeel
this
is
the
first
beer
from
samuel
adams
that
i
wish
i
wouldnt
have
bought
overall
decent
brew
glad
i
tried
it
probably
will
not
have
it
again
i
tend
to
think
of
sam
adams
beers
are
generally
overrated
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
beer
has
something
ill
just
call
it
a
pleasantness
to
it
its
easy
to
drink
and
has
moderate
alcohol
a
very
good
beer
good
effort
but
the
flavors
just
dont
work
personally
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
o
it
was
a
solid
beer
not
something
i
buy
over
and
over
but
not
a
bad
beer
it
was
a
good
beer
for
a
lazy
sunday
afternoon
at
the
house
im
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
going
into
this
beer
but
im
not
disappointed
its
very
malty
and
a
bit
earthy
the
berries
are
there
and
play
nice
with
the
malt
bill
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
ill
probably
buy
another
bottle
this
is
a
chestnut
colored
brew
slight
head
wood
malt
and
citrus
are
present
in
the
aroma
im
not
sure
that
i
discerned
juniper
but
it
does
have
a
resin
character
the
taste
has
some
toasted
malt
character
and
a
solid
bitterness
wood
and
resin
in
the
finish
not
overly
hoppy
full
mouthfeel
and
lingering
aftertaste
nice
22
ounce
bottle
batch
1
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
reddishamber
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
the
head
stays
around
a
while
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
berries
caramel
bready
malt
sweet
spices
and
some
tea
and
herbs
it
tastes
like
caramel
and
bready
malt
slightly
bitter
herbs
toffee
berries
and
a
bit
of
apple
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
a
bit
thick
and
chewy
and
has
moderate
carbonation
i
liked
this
brew
its
worth
a
try
but
not
is
all
lost
the
boston
beer
company
is
only
inspired
by
sahti
and
isnt
making
an
attempt
at
replicating
authentic
versions
but
the
only
resemblance
to
me
is
a
barely
noticable
juniper
character
o
ok
so
i
like
this
beer
good
appearance
good
smells
decent
taste
and
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
but
i
have
nothing
to
judge
it
on
im
pretty
sure
id
have
it
again
but
probably
next
time
id
buy
two
of
them
just
so
i
can
age
one
and
taste
one
fairly
immediately
in
the
meantime
im
most
likely
going
to
seek
out
some
other
sahtis
just
to
compare
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
in
a
style
unusual
to
the
day
bbc
does
a
respectable
job
here
overall
not
too
familiar
with
the
sahti
style
but
this
one
is
alright
in
my
books
it
could
seem
to
me
a
little
cleaner
and
maltier
still
a
good
brew
though
dark
amber
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
herbal
with
lots
of
spruce
a
touch
of
juniper
and
maybe
some
pine
a
nice
fruitiness
of
apples
and
berries
but
there
is
a
definite
rubber
and
metal
aroma
that
is
offputting
light
notes
of
smoke
on
the
palate
with
the
same
herbal
character
light
malt
sweetness
hints
of
fruit
and
only
a
minimal
juniper
flavor
the
metal
and
rubber
is
also
pronounced
which
is
what
really
ruins
the
beer
o
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
the
juniper
clearly
add
some
interesting
and
enjoyable
features
to
the
beer
o
this
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
but
seems
like
the
taste
could
use
a
bit
more
flavors
of
juniper
berries
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
which
is
not
filled
with
easy
drinking
beers
but
not
the
best
example
i
like
the
combination
of
the
spiceherbal
notes
but
i
likely
would
not
get
this
one
again
pours
a
beautiful
light
brown
caramel
color
with
a
tinge
of
foam
that
evaporates
very
quickly
aroma
is
of
sweet
and
sugary
grains
and
hops
tastes
sweet
but
not
overdone
leaves
a
nice
zip
on
the
tongue
as
it
goes
down
a
beautifully
decorated
bottle
as
well
o
its
not
a
stunning
beer
but
id
buy
a
bomber
again
for
6
50
and
would
recommend
it
to
friends
you
can
really
feel
its
potential
perhaps
the
bottle
just
needs
to
be
aged
a
little
longer
or
would
be
better
on
draft
at
the
very
least
i
think
this
would
be
a
tremendous
baseline
for
homebrewers
who
are
considering
their
own
sahti
simply
because
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
just
right
on
target
while
theres
room
for
improvement
in
terms
of
taste
sweeter
and
spicier
please
o
im
actually
pretty
impressed
im
a
sucker
for
peppery
beers
and
this
one
is
funky
but
its
rubbing
my
the
right
way
id
drink
this
again
but
im
not
going
to
buying
a
ton
of
it
at
my
local
bottle
shop
drinkability
pretty
good
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
full
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
it
leaves
a
pretty
heavy
coating
on
the
tongue
and
palate
i
cant
say
if
this
is
good
bad
or
just
utterly
normal
for
the
style
the
beer
was
a
handsome
auburn
color
with
a
generous
white
that
showed
a
decent
level
of
retention
the
aroma
was
a
pleasant
lemony
tea
scent
with
a
spicy
aspect
to
it
in
the
initial
taste
one
picks
up
the
pepper
which
is
followed
by
a
strong
sensation
of
black
jelly
beans
there
is
a
certain
degree
of
earthiness
to
the
taste
the
peppery
sensation
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
as
does
the
tartness
the
beer
is
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
with
a
better
taste
this
could
be
an
easy
drinker
i
have
a
had
several
sahtis
which
i
have
greatly
enjoyed
i
feel
such
a
strong
level
of
dislike
for
this
one
because
it
lacks
the
expected
sweetness
there
is
not
much
of
a
tea
flavor
but
there
is
big
black
jelly
bean
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
redamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
toffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
a
good
dose
of
juniper
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
a
good
amount
of
juniper
and
some
the
toffee
and
bread
notes
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
pretty
good
beer
although
not
as
heavy
on
the
juniper
and
ginlike
notes
as
some
other
sahtis

have
tried

enjoy
it

the

glad
i
tried

on
taste
its

theres

flavor
not
on
an
anchor
osa
scale
certainly
the
yeast
character
is
more
in
line
with
a
standard
ale
slightly
fruity
but
generally
pretty
clean
what
we
have
is
a
strong
malty
beer
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
finnish
sahti
id
have
guessed
it
as
a
scottish
wee
heavy
actually
judged
as
a
wee
heavy
id
probably
give
it
a
higher
rating
an
average
if
somewhat
unusual
beer
worth
checking
out
as
long
as
you
dont
expect
it
to
knock
your
socks
off
o
this
is
a
tasty
beer
although
not
as
much
of
the
herbs
and
juniper
and
twigs
and
stuff
that
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
sahti
pours
a
clear
amber
color
14
inch

of
an
offwhite

decent

decent

of
a
sahti
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
juniper
sweet
malt
slight
dry
hop
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
overall
the
juniper
was
weaker
than
expected
but
still
a
good
beer
mouth
feel
and
aroma
were
the
strongest
aspects
of
this
brew
o
to
be
fair
the
sahti
style
is
not
the
easiest
to
get
right
however
this
beer
is
just
too
thin
to
enjoy
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
easily
drinkable
but
a
tad
watery
not
bad
at
all
an
enjoyable
summer
brew
that
has
a
lighter
taste
than
its
color
lets
on
well
balanced
malt
and
no
sign
of
bitterness
a
bit
hard
to
tell
if
this
a
beer
or
not
o
this
beer
goes
down
easily
enough
but
isnt
particularly
memorable
for
me
ill
remember
it
as
being
mostly
sweet
with
an
indiscriminate
bitterness
on
the
finish
nonetheless
it
was
nice
to
be
able
to
try
this
semiobscure
ancient
style
i
wrote
this
review
with
a
caverage
in
mind
so
my
final
score
indicates
that
this
beer
is
just
beneath
average
in
my
mind
not
as
bad
as
it
may
look
when
compared
to
its
other
scores
if
this
is
around
in
the
future
ill
certainly
revisit
it
once
i
have
greater
sahti
experience
to
make
a
better
attempt
at
reviewing
to
style
poured
a
half
inch
opaque
naples
yellowbeige
head
with
a
relatively
short
life
the
body
is
a
lovely
clear
amber
both
in
masstone
and
held
to
the
light
it
smells
like
rich
and
malty
is
to
come
taste
isnt
quite
as
bold
as
the
smell
hints
but
yes
its
still
rich
theres
still
malt
and
a
fairly
long
finish
id
call
this
similar
to
a
scotch
ale
but
richer
nice
product
odpretty
cool
sam
aams
usually
falls
short
with
their
more
unique
and
ambitious
brews
this
one
was
actually
pretty
legit
very
unique
gotta
respect
taking
a
shot
at
this
style
of
beer
overall
pretty
good
beer
you
will
see
a
few
better
sahtis
out
there
but
this
especially
for
the
money
is
just
right
salud
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
i
anticipated
more
complexity
o
im
very
impressed
by
this
sahti
perhaps
it
is
the
fact
that
it
is
a
more
commercial
version
of
the
style
and
thus
isnt
as
aggressive
on
the
juniper
which
my
palate
tends
to
not
agree
with
quite
happy
overall
not
bad
decent
juniper
decent
malts
not
too
bitter
and
not
overpowering
with
juniper
flavor
not
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
a
flavorful
sahti
a
little
too
big
too
sweet
nice
name
for
a
beer
3
5
overall
for
the
3
of
the
style
ive
had
this
is
not
bad
not
quite
what
it
could
have
been
but
not
a
disappointment
either
worth
a
try
and
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
with
a
lot
going
on
here
i
am
bad
at
breaking
down
this
genre
which
typically
is
complex
as
this
beer
is
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
the
spices
and
wood
are
a
nice
balance
to
the
sweet
malts
nice
to
see
a
old
style
kept
alive
d
very
drinkable
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
balance
is
pretty
nice
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
juniper
flavor
this
beer
pours
out
a
nice
red
color
with
plenty
of
bubbles
and
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
interesting
this
one
uses
the
sam
adams
house
yeast
note
found
in
many
of
their
beers
right
away
but
is
boosted
up
right
away
by
a
huge
hit
of
juniper
and
rye
the
taste
is
really
quite
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
malt
and
yeast
base
tasting
rather
similar
to
a
sweeter
boston
lager
but
with
a
lot
of
juniper
and
rye
coming
in
and
bashing
around
the
tongue
the
finish
is
a
bit
rough
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
highly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
about
average
its
another
interesting
entry
in
the
sam
adams
small
batch
series
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
i
dont
regret
giving
it
a
try
of
the
few
sahtis
ive
had
i
havent
had
any
that
have
really
impressed
me
this
seems
like
an
ok
version
of
the
style
but
is
oddly
diacetly
and
astringent
o
i
really
like
what
the
rye
does
with
the
juniper
in
this
beer
the
berry
flavors
although
mostly
juniper
provide
enough
sweetness
to
go
great
with
the
spiciness
of
the
malt
not
sure
how
some
reviewers
are
calling
this
weak
in
the
smell
and
taste
its
pretty
damned
aromatic
and
flavorful
solid
job
by
sa
on
this
one
o
really
surprised
by
this
one
definitely
the
best
sa
beer
ive
had
very
nice
impulse
buy
it
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
nothing
id
race
back
for
the
biggest
highly
for
me
was
probably
the
aura
of
the
brew
being
a
throwback
i
really
connect
to
those
ideas
and
value
attempts
to
honor
these
more
classic
styles
of
various
historical
cultures
but
while
this
may
have
been
dead
on
balls
accurate
sam
adams
other
attempts
at
this
like
dark
depths
are
just
more
bold
and
satisfying
overall
as
others
have
pointed
out
this
doesnt
much
taste
like
the
other
sahtis
i
have
had
though
admittedly
the
sample
size
could
be
counted
on
one
hand
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
palate
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
amber
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
lighter
wood
spice
and
a
citrus
note
in
the
taste
woody
dry
citrus
and
a
mellow
spice
a
spice
like
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
citrus
and
licorice
in
the
aftertaste
lots
of
flavor
and
quite
enjoyable
o
look
ive
only
tried
2
sahtis
this
one
and
dogfish
heads
and
both
admittedly
took
some
liberties
with
the
traditional
formulation
i
really
liked
the
bright
light
craft
of
the
dfh
sahtea
and
was
ready
for
this
to
fall
short
but
it
doesnt
its
clearly
just
a
darker
take
on
the
same
idea
and
notfornothing
i
think
this
may
be
more
representative
of
a
traditional
sahti
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
and
would
love
to
do
a
sidebyside
overall
so
intriguing
nothing
to
compare
to
this
feels
and
tastes
like
something
other
than
beer
although
it
looks
like
beer
my
first
of
this
style
definitely
worth
a
try
i
love
it
for
its
unusualness
and
earthyoutdoors
taste
and
feel
d
not
bad
but
really
lacking
in
the
classic
sahti
flavors
first
stab
at
this
style
and
yes
i
had
avoided
dfhs
had
this
at
peles
in
jax
fl
on
draft
poured
nice
and
dark
with
fliffy
head
seems
of
bitter
berries
and
wood
dominate
it
also
has
that
elderberry
type
of
flavors
hop
profile
is
low
which
is
great
so
you
can
taste
the
earth
and
berry
flavors
nice
job
sa
for
introducing
me
to
this
style
overall
i
admit
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
shatis
to
compare
this
with
but
it
is
damn
tasty
very
interesting
and
complex
one
of
the
better
small
batch
brews
sam
adams
has
come
out
with
i
wish
the
bitterness
was
left
off
the
end
but
i
would
grab
this
again
o
there
really
isnt
much
to
this
ale
compared
to
traditional
finnish
sahtis
it
is
lacking
in
flavor
and
complexity
not
a
great
effort
o
tastes
like
a
mead
and
a
scottish
wee
heavy
had
a
baby
honey
sweet
and
caramel
rich
with
earthy
characteristics
the
juniper
berry
flavors
arent
quite
there
but
its
interesting
nonetheless
o
a
refreshing
and
unique
taste
this
was
my
first
in
the
style
and
id
like
to
try
more
md
thick
and
viscous
this
flavors
of
this
beer
remains
on
your
lips
after
a
sip
and
you
get
another
burst
of
flavor
when
you
lick
your
lips
the
viscosity
lends
a
smoothness
that
makes
the
unique
flavors
of
this
brew
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
of
this
unnamed
sam
adams
series
rjt
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
dont
feel
like
there
is
a
whole
lot
that
you
can
do
with
this
style
but
i
feel
like
sam
adams
did
it
well
if
anything
this
is
worth
trying
just
to
try
out
a
sahti
its
summer
and
this
thing
is
making
me
think
its
christmas
is
this
christmas
who
cares
god
jul
skol
overall
this
is
just
odd
i
like
the
taste
but
the
aroma
is
a
little
out
of
whack
also
while
i
have
never
had
a
truly
traditional
sahti
i
am
sure
this
is
not
it
shouldnt
a
sahti
be
turgid
with
some
wild
yeast
characteristics
this
just
seems
like
a
stronger
amber
ale
with
some
juniper
and
rye
overall
i
like
it
alot
it
is
the
best
sahti
i
have
tasted
however
i
am
not
sure
about
how
authentic
they
did
it
i
know
they
did
not
strain
hrough
juniper
and
i
have
not
read
anything
about
usinghot
rocks
otherwise
great
beer
norse
legend
hits
upon
the
requirements
from
the
style
but
doesnt
venture
very
far
from
that
norse
legend
is
more
soilwork
than
kalmah
if
you
know
what
i
mean
pours
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
copper
color
with
white
edging
there
is
a
slight
amount
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
starts
out
with
a
floral
hop
aroma
as
the
beer
warms
the
juniper
aroma
comes
out
along
with
a
hint
of
tea
at
the
end
of
the
aroma
the
taste
follows
suit
closely
before
the
beer
warms
there
is
a
floral
hop
taste
up
front
as
the
beer
warms
the
floral
hop
taste
gives
way
to
a
nice
juniper
flavor
at
the
back
end
there
is
a
black
tea
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
the
beer
gets
much
better
as
it
warms
the
flavors
come
out
much
more
with
the
warming
poured
into
a
brandy
snifter
pours
dark
amber
wtih
an
eggshell
colored
head
plenty
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
and
the
side
of
the
glass
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
there
are
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malts
alcohol
juniper
and
citrus
there
is
a
solid
malty
backbone
with
juniper
and
hops
coming
through
in
the
flavor
its
mildly
sweet
but
also
pretty
well
balanced
with
citrus
hop
bitterness
and
the
juniper
flavor
adds
nicely
to
this
beer
i
can
also
taste
some
of
the
alcohol
in
this
one
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
adequate
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
certainly
a
quality
beer
from
the
boston
beer
company
ive
had
real
sahti
before
and
this
is
nothing
like
it
but
its
still
a
really
good
exceptionally
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
came
in
6
packs
the
subtle
juniper
in
the
finish
makes
you
come
back
for
more
always
wanting
more
juniper
that
is
unfortunately
not
there
pours
a
dark
brown
color
fine
clarity
off
white
pillow
fluff
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malts
pine
juniper
and
citrus
in
the
flavor
rich
and
malty
with
caramel
toffee
and
even
cocoa
notes
upfront
there
is
a
nice
pine
and
citrus
profile
from
the
use
of
juniper
and
possibly
a
good
dose
of
hops
the
level
of
bitterness
was
light
to
moderate
small
alcohol
presence
and
overall
this
brew
was
very
tasty
stood
up
pretty
well
to
a
brick
oven
pizza
overall
i
am
quite
pleased
i
dont
really
have
anything
else
to
compare
it
too
but
the
flavors
work
quite
well
and
add
a
nice
complexity
something
i
would
definitely
have
again
a
mediumbodied
beer
it
lacks
many
of
the
characteristics
that
are
common
in
finnish
sahtis
the
hazy
orange
or
deep
yellow
color
a
slight
sour
note
a
more
detectable
rye
spiciness
in
the
grain
bill
and
a
stronger
juniper
aroma
and
flavor
again
malt
sweetness
dominates
with
a
whisper
of
juniper
in
the
finish
especially
as
the
glass
warms
hallertau
mittelfrueh
hops
offer
a
welcome
if
atypical
orange
rind
quality
to
the
taste
well
made
for
sure
but
slightly
disappointing
for
lovers
of
sahti
i
am
really
liking
the
sam
adams
small
batches
this
one
is
great
and
it
is
great
to
find
new
styles
of
beer
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
it
is
pretty
light
and
fruity
it
packs
a
punch
essentially
norse
legend
drinks
like
a
really
wellmade
red
ale
with
some
herbal
primarily
juniper
elements
added
it
for
those
of
you
in
the
boston
area
there
are
some
overlapping
features
with
the
ontapinbostononly
boston
brick
red
also
from
the
boston
beer
company
norse
legend
is
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
that
has
taken
a
rarity
in
the
beer
world
and
made
it
into
an
immensely
drinkable
treat
its
quite
enjoyable
and
would
be
appreciated
by
a
variety
of
beer
drinkers
this
is
a
beer
worth
your
time
o
not
completely
tradtional
especially
with
what
ive
had
from
finland
but
i
did
quite
enjoy
it
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
frothy
light
low
profile
offwhite
head
that
slowly
settles
into
a
filmy
coating
aromas
of
roasted
caramel
and
maple
sweetness
with
some
citrus
and
fruity
highlights
and
a
woody
earthy
tone
throughout
flavors
are
rich
and
malty
with
a
caramel
and
chocolatey
backbone
giving
rise
to
some
roasted
and
earthy
characteristics
as
well
as
a
bittersweet
fruit
highlight
solid
smooth
bodied
with
a
roasty
and
sweet
fruit
aftertaste
the
finish
is
light
but
solid
with
some
green
and
earthy
character
giving
a
linger
on
the
tastebuds
interesting
brew
mouthfeeloverall
pretty
light
bodied
and
smooth
but
a
bit
light
on
carbonation
and
not
too
lively
overall
very
interesting
but
not
a
favorite
worth
trying
though
drinkability
is
real
nice
on
this
beer
a
very
nice
balance
of
malt
and
fruit
the
juniper
berries
have
a
nice
undertone
and
dont
overpower
like
some
fruit
beers
the
undertones
make
this
beer
very
refreshing
this
would
be
a
great
beer
in
spring
or
summer
and
i
would
definitely
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
this
beer
like
nothing
i
have
ever
tried
before
sam
adams
never
disappoints
well
done
o
no
bad
or
off
putting
flavors
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
i
like
the
fact
the
sam
adams
is
trying
different
styles
and
they
should
keep
trying
new
things
with
the
single
batch
series
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
again
this
beer
is
certainly
different
and
it
is
also
reasonably
tasty
but
it
perhaps
isnt
a
great
sahti
instead
of
tasting
like
a
juniperpreserved
rustic
ale
it
tastes
sorta
like
a
topnotch
amber
ale
with
significant
botanical
adjuncts
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
though
a
bit
different
for
my
taste
solid
beer
and
worth
trying
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
too
exciting
to
get
worked
up
about
unfortunately
overall
this
is
pretty
unique
worth
a
shot
for
sure
once
again
great
to
see
bbc
experimenting
and
diving
into
the
weird
styles
after
tasting
dogfish
heads
sahti
norse
legend
just
seems
like
an
attempt
at
creating
another
style
to
flood
the
market
place
with
flavors
arent
there
and
neither
is
the
merit
at
its
best
its
drinkable
with
some
flavor
for
7
abv
paired
with
some
norwegian
goat
cheese
excellent
on
tap
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
zero
lacing
aromas
of
berries
tea
and
cola
smells
somewhat
like
a
fruity
tea
tastes
like
tea
but
not
as
fruity
as
the
aroma
but
more
of
an
earthy
tea
flavor
a
bit
floral
peppery
light
mouthfeel
i
know
its
not
a
high
abv
but
this
doesnt
really
taste
all
that
boozey
almost
tastes
like
drinking
peppery
iced
tea
i
like
tea
so
this
one
is
ok
by
me
but
it
might
not
be
for
everyone
overall
i
would
drink
it
every
so
often
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it

this
poured
out
as
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
was
a
little
bit
on
the
floral
side
with
some
herbs
in
the
mix
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
good
but
really
becomes
interesting
in
the
finish
with
the
herbal
notes
really
come
out
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
soft
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
beer
was
rather
impressive
this
is
something
id
like
to
see
sam
adams
do
more
with
beer
had
slight
ring
of
a
head
and
an
amber
body
minty
smell
not
strong
resin
taste
was
very
sweet
slight
mouthwash
flavor
but
the
sweetness
really
pervades
this
beer
little
carbonation
i
cant
say
i
am
a
real
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
have
not
had
very
many
authentic
examples
of
this
style
but
it
really
doesnt
taste
anything
like
i
think
it
would
not
very
piney
at
all
overall
i
had
to
drink
this
in
about
10
minutes
so
while
it
wasnt
enjoyed
to
the
fullest
extent
it
was
definitely
a
brew
i
would
purchase
again
if
accessible
i
also
had
no
idea
what
is
was
when
i
purchased
it
but
was
intrigued
so
this
was
my
first
foray
into
the
sahti
style
oone
of
the
few
commercially
available
examples
of
sahti
available
outside
of
finland
this
beer
is
based
on
a
shared
style
brewed
in
finland
gotland
and
the
estonian
island
of
saaremaa
the
name
koduõlu
mean
literally
homebrew
which
is
synonymous
in
the
baltic
and
scandinavia
with
farmhouse
style
beers
which
showcase
bold
and
funky
flavors
many
of
these
beers
incorporate
juniper
but
not
all
this
was
a
pleasant
and
mild
interpretation
of
the
style
and
very
approachable
for
someone
not
used
to
these
beers
without
being
dumbed
down
to
the
point
of
being
unrecognizable
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
possible
sahti
gateway
drug
drinkers
will
eager
to
explore
this
style
more
o
this
beer
defied
all
my
expectations
heavily
spiced
and
aromatic
sweet
and
warming
a
perfect
beer
for
christmas
time
theres
even
a
reindeer
on
the
bottle
too
sweet
and
heavy
to
be
sessionable
not
to
mention
the
9
abv
more
of
a
dessert
beer
highly
recommended
outstanding
complexity
definitely
a
trading
beer
delicious
spiced
brew
artfully
brewed
with
excellently
balanced
ingredients
sweet
but
not
cloying
light
nice
aftertaste
hazy
straw
color
the
nose
is
sweet
much
like
a
fruity
herbal
tea
the
two
dominant
flavors
are

and

finish
upon
my
first
smell
of
this
beer
i
was
hesitant
if
it
was
going
to
taste
good
or
not
the
aroma
was
very
malty
and
typically
im
not
a
fan
of
malty
tasting
beers
but
upon
my
first
sip
i
was
pleasantly
surprising
i
definitely
taste
the
chai
spices
and
tea
i
dont
get
much
of
the
juniper
this
beer
also
feels
lighter
on
the
palate
than
i
expected
this
was
a
draught
servingand
its
golden
color
reminded
me
of
a
belgian
wit
but
the
flavors
reminded
me
of
a
nice
gin
if
you
like
gin
and
weissbier
seek
this
out
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
in
which
the
chai
and
juniper
balance
and
complement
each
other
this
never
tastes
like
gin
and
the
alcohol
is
totally
hidden
o
interesting
just
when
i
think
ive
had
my
last
sip
im
drawn
back
for
another
impressed
and
well
done
sam
probably
my
favorite
from
the
ancient
ales
line
from
dogfish
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
almost
a
rose
hue
to
it
the
smell
was
full
of
spice
mint
sage
as
well
as
a
ton
of
clove
the
taste
was
really
nice
in
my
opinion
starts
of
mild
and
herby
and
seems
to
grow
till
there
is
a
bite
of
mint
at
the
end
which
made
for
a
much
more
refreshing
beer
than
i
had
anticipated
overall
i
found
it
quite
the
enjoyable
find
bleedsblu
recommends
drink
it
o
damn
good
liberal
in
the
additives
but
carefully
meted
and
balanced
by
one
another
surely
not
a
typical
style
but
if
you
have
an
open
mind
you
will
at
least
be
able
to
appreciate
this
one
and
if
not
send
it
to
me
pours

overall
an

good

body

o
i
appreciate
dogfish
immensely
for
what
they
do
i
often
love
what
they
do
here
i
appreciate
the
concept
but
am
underwhelmed
by
the
execution
its
clearly
a
wellbrewed
beer
and
i
appreciate
every
element
theyve
incorporated
id
like
to
access
the
sahti
backbone
a
bit
more
the
combination
of
resiny
juniper
and
intrinsicallystrong
sweet
spices
overwhelms
the
subtlety
and
renders
the
beer
too
complexly
sweet
to
put
it
simply
i
do
stand
impressed
by
the
wellcloaked
nature
of
the
high
abv
and
if
youre
looking
for
a
sweet
alcoholic
carbonated
iced

look
not
a
drop
further
than
here
just
noticed
the

my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
5242013
onot
for
me
thankfully
a
2
oz
sample
goes
away
quickly
o
one
of
my
favorite
low
alcohol
beers
on
the
planet
if
you
like
chai
tea
you
have
to
try
this
i
also
think
its
got
a
little
similar
taste
to
the
noble
rot
so
if
you
like
that
you
should
at
least
try
this
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
but
its
very
sweet
and
flavorful
and
i
imagine
it
is
best
shared
with
friends
perhaps
in
a
snifter
on
a
cold
night
very
interesting
stronger
beer
with
big
spicy
flavors
that
shroud
the
booziness
somewhat
nice
orangy
light
color
and
smells
boozier
with
clovey
citrusy
sour
notes
light
balanced
mouthfeel
but
the
lingering
chai
and
spice
afternotes
leave
me
a
bit
befuddled
pretty
good
o
one
of
my
favorite
dogfish
beers
but
i
also
am
a
sucker
for
chai
overall
great
beer
easy
to
drink
with
the
sweet
and
spicy
characteristics
of
the
chai
tea
deceitful
considering
the
9
abv
disclaimer
i
am
a
fan
of
chai
tea
and
would
enthusiastically
encourage
all
of
those
who
also
enjoy
that
beverage
to
investigate
this
beer
however
if
you
are
indifferent
or
better
yet
dislike
chai
tea
altogether
you
may
not
necessarily
enjoy
this
offering
but
would
always
welcome
those
to
challenge
their
palates
as
you
just
might
surprise
yourself
o
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
that
work
pretty
well
together
somewhat
like
an
orange
with
cloves
stuck
in
it
dipped
in
chai
tea
with
wheat
and
berries
not
exactly
sure
what
a
traditional
shati
beer
tastes
like
but
this
one
is
complex
and
interesting
like
most
dogfish
head
beers
o
overall
i
find
this
a
clean
but
not
entirely
great
beer
i
dont
care
for
the
mix
of
juniper
and
other
spices
although
interesting
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
tastefeel
tea
with
a
tangy
belgian
characteristic
berries
somebody
mentioned
cinnamon
and
i
got
that
as
well
not
bitter
in
the
slightest
sort
of
refreshing
but
at
the
same
time
theres
a
slight
warmth
of
alcohol
interesting
tasty
beer
i
believe
it
was
12
for
the
bottle
which
isnt
too
bad
at
all
for
such
a
unique
tasting
brew
its
not
for
everybody
it
has
a
good
bit
of
funk
to
it
in
the
taste
and
aroma
but
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
lot
worth
a
pick
up
this
is
an
interesting
one
it
has
a
unique
flavor
the
chai
is
prominent
in
the
aroma
but
not
in
the
taste
overall
enjoyed
this
beer
a
nice
pairing
with
some
thai
food
but
if
the
food
had
been
spicier
selections
the
beer
may
have
been
overpowered
a
nice
sippin
beer
with
the
right
food
combination
interesting
flavor
combination
complicated
and
nicely
blended
flavors
worth
contemplating
again
it
would
have
been
easy
to
push
this
one
over
the
top
but
it
is
nicely
done
its
hit
or
miss
for
many
with
beers
as
daring
as
this
brewer
pushes
out
immediate
hit
in
my
book
its
very
flavorful
with
the
cinnamon
and
spice
noted
i
do
get
that
vanilla
chai
taste
and
the
flavor
just
keeps
on
building
and
being
interesting
i
get
pumpkin
from
this
too
yet
this
still
comes
off
as
a
farmhouse
type
of
effort
it
just
works
medicinal
neccowaferish
my
first
sahtea
but
at
least
my
second
ancient
recipe
the
1st
being
this
brewerys
midas
touch
i
much
prefer
this
one
an
above
beer
but
merely
par
for
the
course
from
dogfish
there
are
better
options
in
their
750ml
offerings
o
my
finnish
wife
spotted
this
one
at
our
trip
to
the
bottle
shop
she
suggested
it
based
solely
on
her
heritage
im
glad
she
did
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
found
it
full
of
flavor
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
think
what
i
liked
most
was
the
spiciness
of
the
beer
i
also
think
that
the
low
carbonation
was
nice
too
but
i
found
that
i
did
get
a
bit
of
a
headache
after
the
second
small
glass
a
rather
pleasant
teainfused
big
belgianstyle
beer
which
is
obviously
not
the
intent
here
but
hey
its
dfh
so
you
never
really
know
the
nods
to
finnish
brewing
history
are
tangential
at
best
especially
after
the
guest
ingredient
quickly
runs
its
course
so
the
best
i
can
say
about
this
is
forget
preconditions
and
premonitions
this
is
a
tasty
teabagged
strong
ale
all
without
the
immediate
alcohol
heat
conditions
one
might
readily
expect
taste
follows
suit
for
the
most
part
but
citrus
is
more
the
main
player
with
the
tea
bringing
up
the
rear
as
well
as
some
banana
some
black
pepper
and
clove
spiciness
too
and
a
touch
of
honey
not
much
of
the
rye
to
be
found
feel
is
light
tart
and
refreshing
not
sticky
and
not
boozy
very
good
beer
if
your
are
looking
for
something
different
gives
you
a
bunch
of
great
flavors
but
its
balanced
an
d
delightful
making
this
just
yet
another
great
brew
from
dfh
o
different
interesting
o
this
brew
is
not
in
my
normal
category
that
i
would
rate
highly
there
is
a
lack
of
hops
dryness
that
i
miss
however
i
usually
order
this
for
one
glass
when
i
am
at
a
dfh
overall
i
only
wish
it
had
more
juniper
berries
in
the
flavor
but
its
still
a
great
beer
overallnice
sweetspiced
beer
i
will
definitely
try
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
especially
as
an
after
dinnerdessert
offering
i
have
not
had
a
traditional
sahti
so
id
be
interested
to
see
how
this
compares
i
e
if
it
would
be
as
sweet
or
if
dfh
just
wanted
to
compliment
the
chai
tea
addition
in
general
i
wonder
if
other
positive
reviewers
have
been
seduced
by
what
the
brewers
indicate
they
did
to
create
this
beer
instead
of
focusing
on
what
has
actually
been
created
there
are
other
things
it
could
and
should
be
based
upon
the
general
description
of
recipe
but
there
is
little
opportunity
for
juniper
and
other
scandinavian
herbs
to
contribute
as
they
might
perhaps
due
to
the
choice
of
malts
and
high
dose
of
alcohol
as
a
result
even
time
and
warmth
dont
make
it
stylistically
on
target
even
if
its
curiously
drinkable
complex
and
unique
pretty
good
overall
solid
beer
it
does
exactly
what
i
expected
from
the
style
description
and
the
bottles
label
not
an
everyday
or
session
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
a
must
try
for
anyone
looking
for
something
different
and
a
bit
exotic
awsome
brew
loved
it
such
a
rich
beautifull
beer
loved
all
the
flavors
that
just
kept
coming
with
every
sip
it
cant
get
much
better
than
this
folks
im
a
fan
flavorfull
beers
and
this
one
hit
a
home
run
its
kinda
ornagey
twang
light
sweet
floral
notes
as
it
warmed
up
this
is
one
you
can
just
keep
drinking
and
drinking
and
drinking
and
never
get
tiered
of
it
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
dont
think
ive
ever
tasted
anything
like
it
due
to
the
price
i
probably
wont
ever
drink
it
again
but
i
did
enjoy
it
ive
yet
to
have
a
weird
concoction
like
this
from
dogfish
and
this
really
is
quite
interesting
not
something
i
would
really
need
to
go
back
to
but
surely
worth
trying
definitely
recommended
for
tea
lovers
the
aroma
is
bigtime
acidic
fruit
spices
sweet
and
savory
very
aromatic
the
flavor
follows
but
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
very
good
mix
of
sweet
and
salty
flavors
big
malt
presence
with
lively
yeast
esters
various
spices
that
show
up
at
different
times
this
would
obviously
pair
excellent
with
indian
food
or
other
curry
dishes
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
mckenzie
seasonal
special
apple
cider
that
is
brewed
with
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
great
summer
fall
beer
overall
sahtea
is
the
second
of
the
ancient
ales
produced
by
dogfish
that
ive
had
the
first
being
theobroma
and
i
have
to
say
so
far
dogfish
is
2
for
2
i
really
liked
this
beer
though
not
as
much
as
theobroma
and
ill
certainly
get
it
again
looking
forward
to
the
other
editions
of
the
ancient
ale
series
this
shatea
has
a
pretty
amazing
flavor
the
juniper
berries
and
black
chai
really
push
through
this
beer
the
smell
is
super
packed
with
the
chai
smell
it
does
have
chunks
in
it
and
i
know
that
some
beers
have
chunksbut
personally
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
however
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
so
exotic
and
complex
that
ill
take
em
this
beer
is
the
reason
i
love
dogfish
crazy
beers
that
when
they
hit
the
mark
are
a
hug
success
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
all
around
i
would
love
to
get
this
year
round
if
i
could
o
this
reminds
me
of
gulab
jamun
but
with
more
natural
earthy
essence
and
a
dialed
down
syrupy
sweetness
super
complex
brew
that
has
layers
upon
layers
building
an
ever
evolving
flavor
profile

o
i
really
like
this
one
and
find
it
redemptive
of
many
of
dogfisheads
history
based
brews
which
i
found
disappointing
this
one
is
packed
with
taste
and
leaves
me
wanting
to
drink
more
taste
is
bold
spiced
and
malty
sweet
even
almost
syrupy
theres
a
clearcut
chai
tea
spice
finish
with
relatively
little
dryness
or
heat
at
all
very
smooth
and
complex
this
is
a
real
treat
and
very
enjoyable
high
marks
here
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
gold
almost
muddy
water
brown
with
a
lovely
little
fourth
of
a
fingers
width
head
of
tight
small
eggshellwhite
bubbles
the
beers
body
is
very
hazy
and
opaque
with
some
chunks
floating
in
it
though
the
carbonation
bubbles
can
clearly
be
seen
racing
to
the
surface
the
lacing
on
the
beer
is
spotty
and
thin
leaving
haphazard
patches
across
the
glass
the
smell
is
tremendous
on
this
beer
it
starts
with
a
huge
banana
bread
bouquet
clearly
showing
the
beers
weizen
yeast
but
then
the
smell
spices
up
with
peppery
notes
and
a
lovely
milky
herbalspice
from
the
chai
this
beer
smells
big
and
complex
there
are
even
hints
of
souring
lactic
acids
and
maybe
even
a
slight
tart
cherry
fruit
leather
note
on
the
tongue
this
beer
tastes
soft
sweet
and
spicy
the
beer
begins
with
big
banana
flavors
of
a
weizen
beer
and
strange
enough
the
lactic
cherry
sour
flavors
of
a
flanders
red
before
it
opens
into
spicy
notes
and
then
hits
the
palate
with
light
cinnamon
ginger
and
cloves
the
finish
is
stronger
with
the
chai
and
herbal
notes
while
green
pepper
flavors
hint
at
the
tongue
the
aftertaste
returns
to
a
sweet
banana
linger
alongside
the
lactic
tart
cherry
while
all
other
flavors
fade
off
the
tongue
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
its
nine
percent
rating
but
you
definitely
feel
it
in
the
face
after
a
glass
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
and
fluffy
in
body
with
a
nice
jelling
as
it
washes
over
the
tongue
and
a
slight
cloying
nature
from
the
sweetness
of
the
drink
the
mouth
is
left
dry
on
the
tongue
but
wet
on
the
sides
leaving
the
mouth
confused
but
asking
for
more
overall
this
is
a
hugely
complex
beer
im
actually
curious
if
i
got
an
infected
batch
or
if
the
beer
is
supposed
to
have
an
almost
flanders
red
style
taste
in
its
opening
and
in
its
smell
the
beer
is
hugely
tasty
for
its
high
alcohol
percentage
and
quite
complex
a
winner
for
sure
o
just
like
everything
that
dogfish
head
makesthis
was
unique
great
sipper
was
too
heavy
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
glasses
full
so
1
big
bottle
was
absolutely
perfect
i
would
get
it
again
some
time
probably
after
having
a
basic
sahti
to
compare
it
to
overall
another
extremely
interesting
brew
from
dogfish
head
cant
say
ive
really
had
anything
comparable
to
this
one
really
enjoyable
stuff
its
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
all
the
time
but
ill
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
in
the
future
it
would
be
a
great
christmasholiday
beer
o
im
not
really
sure
what
a
sahti
is
supposed
to
be
like
but
i
think
this
may
come
close
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
the
stuff
thats
listed
on
the
bottle
would
have
brought
it
farther
away
from
the
mark
if
i
could
taste
or
smell
them
by
that
i
mean
the
cinnamon
ginger
and
rye
thats
the
gripe
that
i
seem
to
have
with
most
dogfish
head
beers
they
list
a
ton
of
ingredients
and
i
can
only
appreciate
a
few
of
them
nevertheless
this
was
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
as
the
9
abv
was
nowhere
to
be
found
this
is
an
interesting
introduction
to
sahtis
a
style
that
i
think
id
like
to
explore
more
pours
a
hazy
but
vibrant
gold
color
thick
pure
white
rocky
head
looks
alive
aromas
of
oranges
and
alcohol
with
just
a
touch
of
resin
very
inviting
clean
smell
starts
with
a
sort
of
tart
orange
juice
type
flavor
then
the
alcohol
flavor
makes
itself
known
finishing
with
spicy
pepper
notes
not
really
sweet
but
not
bitter
at
all
no
hops
flavors
have
read
that
sahti
is
not
traditianally
hopped
at
all
very
smooth
and
fairly
refreshing
dry
finish
light
to
medium
carbonation
i
dont
really
pick
up
the
juniper
which
is
too
bad
i
think
juniper
would
be
delicious
in
some
beers
but
i
havent
been
able
to
taste
it
in
the
beers
that
advertise
it
enjoyable
and
interesting
for
sure
o
nice
sweet
tea
yummy
very
drinkable
o
man
what
a
beer
it
really
comes
across
with
a
lot
of
spices
pours
amber
yellow
in
color
with
a
good
amount
of
sediment
in
the
glass
head
is
good
at
pour
but
disappates
quickly
to
almost
nothing
and
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
doesnt
impact
the
mouthfeel
which
is
still
quality
a
pop
of
bitter
on
the
front
sweet
throughout
most
of
the
body
to
the
end
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
boot
taste
is
sweet
with
the
tea
detectable
but
not
over
the
top
almost
could
be
classified
in
a
strong
witbier
category
o
its
an
interesting
taste
not
for
everyone
but
i
like
it
in
moderation
o
an
enjoyable
tasty
offering
from
dogfish
head
i
love
the
combination
of
spices
mixed
with
the
chai
tea
and
berries
alcohol
is
masked
well
lending
a
high
drinkability
to
this
brew
this
is
one
of
the
most
memorable
unique
and
flavorful
beers
ive
had
this
year
even
halfway
into
the
bottle
chunks
of
visible
yeast
were
getting
into
my
glass
its
a
paler
orange
color
with
okay
head
retention
and
no
lace
the
nose
brings
a
lot
of
juniper
berries
honey
and
even
tea
the
taste
feeds
off
the
aroma
which
again
is
led
by
juniper
berries
tingles
of
orange
tea
and
theres
even
a
slight
tartness
to
the
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
to
this
low
carbonated
medium
bodied
beer
a
surprise
for
me
as
this
sahti
is
relatively
easy
to
approach
definitely
interesting
and
rated
based
on
my
level
of
enjoyment
sometimes
these
dogfish
ales
are
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
is
a
hit
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
simply
a
great
combination
of
beer
and
tea
the
spices
are
strong
but
in
no
way
overpowering
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
draft
as
i
have
only
had
the
bottles
the
color
is
a
rich
amber
and
the
nose
is
personally
my
favorite
part
if
yankee
candle
would
make
this
scent
id
have
one
in
every
room
o
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
a
special
treat
to
beer
drnikers
that
like
orange
flavors
and
citrusy
weizens
hefeweizens
and
flavorful
wheats
a
sweet
treat
indeed
o
this
brew
would
be
great
from
spring
to
fall
hot
days
very
easy
to
drink
as
one
reviewer
mentioned
if
you
like
chai
tea
you
need
to
try
this
one
will
consume
more
of
these
for
sure
unique
beer
basically
an
avoid
if
you
dont
like
chai
tea
or
a
must
if
you
like
it
like
i
do
another
wacky
idea
dogfish
head
successfully
pulls
off
overall
this
is
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
pun
intended
glad
i
split
it
with
a
buddy
because
it
would
have
been
a
chore
to
try
to
consume
this
solo
flavors
are
just
not
what
i
want
in
a
beer
and
even
for
this
style
the
palate
seems
a
bit
heavy
and
muddled
osahtea
was
pretty
nice
i
paired
it
with
a
heavier
salad
and
it
proved
to
highlight
the
better
notes
of
both
the
meal
and
the
brew
i
would
highly
recommend
this
as
opposed
to
drinking
it
alone
as
some
of
the
undertones
can
be
easily
masked
by
the
alcohol
without
it
not
bad
but
may
not
purchase
again
review
from
notes
all
in
all
sahtea
comes
across
as
a
decent
tripel
with
some
ginlike
overtones
wouldnt
be
mistaken
for
a
traditional
sahti
perhaps
by
mellowing
the
fermentation
taming
the
alcohol
and
lowering
its
octane
a
couple
notches
better
balance
would
be
achieved
id
like
to
think
ive
had
an
example
of
this
from
them
where
all
the
elements
where
in
more
ideal
accordance
nice
to
try
at
least
once
and
best
on
draft
medium
body
slightly
creamy
moderately
carbonated
a
refreshing
ale
with
a
nice
offbeat
twist
to
it
funky
at
times
sweet
and
zesty
overall
its
worth
a
try
i
picked
this
up
for
the
second
time
after
years
of
not
having
it
its
like
having
it
for
the
first
time
all
over
again
overall
very
interesting
brew
and
great
to
try
one
of
the
older
styles
a
really
nice
beer
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
hands
down
simply
fantastic
if
you
have
ever
had
and
enjoyed
a
chai
tea
this
is
a
must
try
i
poured
this
22oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
it
has
a
nice
murkey
yellow
gold
color
body
with
no
head
but
a
thin
lace
around
the
edge
the
smell
is
very
inviting
of
chai
and
black
tea
with
some
malt
coming
through
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
chai
right
up
front
and
the
juniper
flavor
come
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
well
balanced
in
flavor
nice
mouth
feel
and
overall
a
really
interesting
good
beer
couldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
but
im
glad
i
tryed
this
one
review
from
72010
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
cloudy
orange
amber
thin
head
and
no
lacing
spicy
sweet
malt
aroma
with
pine
and
belgian
spice
elements
a
clove
spice
flavor
reminiscent
of
belgian
ales
with
a
light
sweet
malt
body
medium
malts
and
spices
slight
hop
and
spicy
finish
with
a
hint
of
the
tea
interesting
and
satisfying
worth
a
revisit
overall
quite
different
not
sure
if
its
something
i
would
pick
up
again
for
the
price
but
it
was
definitely
tasty
well
this
is
one
of
those
beers
to
which
i
really
have
no
comparison
to
base
it
on
stylewise
it
pours
a
light
gold
color
and
clear
like
a
crystalweiss
almost
i
get
juniper
and
some
menthol
noteswhich
does
but
shouldnt
remind
me
of
menthol
cigarettes
since
the
aroma
is
nothing
like
that
more
herbal
piney
eucalyptus
more
like
the
smell
of
evergreens
after
a
spring
rainfall
a
complex
finish
that
lingers
and
takes
some
getting
used
to
an
interesting
beer
from
an
interesting
brewery
ill
have
to
try
more
sahti
and
see
how
this
compares
overall
i
have
heard
this
one
is
better
bottled
the
flavor
is
full
and
there
are
no
off
putting
notes
this
one
becomes
more
and
more
drinkable
as
it
is
enjoyed
o
i
would
recommend
this
beer
the
high
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
so
be
careful
but
it
is
quite
tasty
i
will
be
stocking
up
o
this
beer
is
mediocre
at
best
its
too
boozy
and
too
spicy
all
at
once
i
dont
think
its
bad
but
its
not
all
that
good
either
o
another
excellent
beer
from
dogfish
head
enjoyable
for
the
summertime
o
a
pretty
refreshing
brew
for
a
warm
july
afternoon
at
the
brewpub
the
9
abv
isnt
fully
detected
and
the
tart
fruitiness
is
a
nice
reprieve
however
most
of
these
ancient
ale
recipes
all
veer
too
close
to
midas
touch
for
my
taste
it
was
good
but
im
unlikely
to
get
it
again
o
this
is
certainly
unique
and
i
like
it
but
the
spice
is
so
intense
im
having
trouble
finishing
a
glass
let
alone
the
bottle
overall
it
was
an
interesting
and
tasty
brew
one
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
after
having
this
and
doing
some
research
on
sahti
ive
realized
that
sam
adams
norse
legend
cant
even
hold
a
candle
to
this
thing
while
not
being
part
of
the
19th
century
i
feel
some
how
brought
back
by
this
beer
very
very
good
good
shiz
o
this
is
my
first
sahtea
and
i
like
it
definitely
a
change
of
pace
especially
for
an
ipa
drinker
it
might
be
a
sessionable
beer
for
some
but
for
me
it
will
remain
a
changeup
pitch
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
great
selection
in
the
winter
to
lighten
up
from
all
the
heavier
winter
beers
without
losing
that
warming
holiday
spice
taste
is
very
sweet
pine
but
obviously
juniper
hints
of
spice
and
citrus
as
well
slightly
overly
sweet
but
nice
mouthfeel
although
booze
is
present
overalla
very
unique
brew
and
something
i
hope
to
have
again
maybe
even
aged
o
as
my
first
experience
with
the
style
i
would
say
this
a
pretty
well
crafted
brew
and
hits
on
the
intentions
of
the
style
juniper
is
present
throughout
although
i
did
not
find
much
of
the
black
chai
tea
taste
that
is
mentioned
on
the
label
d
very
drinkable
lots
of
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
mixed
in
but
the
overall
beer
comes
together
quite
nicely
i
like
the
juniper
especially
pours
a
mild
brown
with
a
slight
tan
head
smell
has
mild
malts
with
a
nice
spice
backbone
the
first
sip
is
mild
malt
forward
with
spice
notes
and
a
smooth
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
this
beer
goes
down
super
easy
for
a
9
beer
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
traditional
finnish
sahti
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
originally
reviewed
11292010
weird
one
pours
quite
hazy
orangeish
light
brown
with
a
short
white
head
that
dies
off
after
a
few
minutes
smells
like
spices
of
the
far
east
ginger
even
flowers
very
strange
but
tempting
flavor
has
quite
a
bit
of
the
tea
flavor
come
through
which
is
smooth
and
earthy
ancient
interesting
malt
profile
as
well
amber
malts
rye
malts
interesting
combination
feel
is
good
fuller
bodied
boozy
and
has
average
carbonation
overall
this
isnt
anywhere
my
favorite
dogfish
brew
but
it
is
an
example
of
why
they
are
like
no
other
what
other
brewery
would
attempt
something
like
this
and
execute
it
so
well
this
belongs
in
a
museam
somewhere
d
a
very
unique
brew
with
a
lot
of
aromas
and
flavors
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
and
will
seek
out
more
of
the
ancient
ales
from
dfh
overall
this
is
not
quite
like
the
other
more
traditional
version
of
the
style
ive
had
in
fact
side
by
side
they
seem
like
2
very
different
styles
but
i
am
rating
and
reviewing
what
is
in
the
glass
not
the
tradition
id
have
liked
more
juniper
or
nettles
that
said
this
was
still
very
tasty
brew
my
wife
who
does
not
drink
beer
at
all
liked
the
aroma
and
actually
tried
this
i
could
drink
this
was
her
quote
they
did
something
right
o
knew
id
love
this
beer
dogfish
head
makes
amazing
stuff
their
big
beers
burton
baton
midas
touch
ww
stout
120m
ipa
etc
are
all
topnotch
and
this
beer
is
right
there
especially
recommended
for
lovers
of
midas
touch
didnt
expect
to
find
this
beer
hope
im
equally
lucky
with
others
in
their
ancient
ales
line
of
beers
doa
overall
quite
tasty
as
with
dogfish
head
alot
of
flavors
first
few
sips
i
wasnt
digging
it
but
after
i
got
used
to
it
i
started
enjoying
it
the
lemon
and
banana
flavor
overpowers
this
a
little
wish
there
was
more
berry
flavor
overall
good
and
different
not
sure
id
buy
again
but
id
try
on
tap
for
sure
o
an
interesting
beer
and
an
interesting
style
plenty
of
flavor
and
complexity
and
enjoyable
to
drink
somewhat
like
a
saison
and
a
heffe
had
a
baby
id
recommend
it
both
my
favorite
and
least
favorite
version
of
the
style
just
being
funny
this
is
the
only
sahti
that
ive
ever
had
its
not
bad
like
i
said
i
enjoyed
it
more
the
first
time
around
3
5
overall
a
lot
going
on
here
and
i
am
not
disappointed
and
neither
should
you
salud
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
have
been
very
hesitant
to
try
any
of
dfhs
ancient
ales
but
after
drinking
this
phenom
i
will
have
to
change
my
approach

what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
flavoring
and
the
aroma
they
were
both
robust
with
all
the

very
reminiscent
of
a

i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
but
need
to
share
it
with
a
few
friends
maybe
a
little
too
sweet

tastes
a

like

tea
or
chai
with
a

banana
sweetness
to
it
the
spicy
aftertaste
stick
around
for
a

not
a
bad
brew
i
find
mostly
based
on
propensity
towards
herbal
beers
with
a
different
bitterness
than
hops
lend
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
pleasant
experience
its

to

are

the

the

of
belgian
beers
that
bars
push
during
the
summer
months
all
of
these
other
beers
cause
sahtea
to
lose
some
of
its
unique

gets

i
prefer
the
more

because
this

is
just

the

it
does
have
enough
malt
to
make
it
recognizable
as
a

enough
juniper
to
make
it
a

the
yeast
makes
it
more
like
a

lambic
i
dont
get
much
in
the
way
of

the
taste
is
like

with

a

a

of

are
its

worth

buy

this
reminds

soured

acidity

flavors
that
dont

it

a

that
i
highly

drinkability
is
good
because
its
so
unique
and
light
its
not
exceptionally
good
because
the
beer
is
so
weird
though
you
could
certainly
wonder
about
and
enjoy
this
beer
all
the
way
thru
a
serving
i
dont
think
this
is
one
you
pound
in
one
sitting
to
discover
like
you
might
an
abyss
or
some
other
complex
ris
its
no
doubt
another
extraordinary
dfh
concoction
worthy
of
any
craft
brew
collection
dfh
your
750s
are
amazing
ive
got
a
couple
stored
away
and
will
keep
doing
so
if
they
keep
being
this
good
a
good
beer
like
a
heavy
wit
but
heavy
in
a
flavor
way
the
ginger
and
some
clove
remind
me
of
a
christmas
ale
very
light
in
color
decent
head
that
didnt
hang
around

evrything
i

still
comes

spice
its

very

easy

at

very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
dont

id
always
have
it
in
my
fridge
but
once
in
a
while
it
would
be
a
nice
treat
if
you
have
the
chance
give
it
a
try
its
a
very
strange
and
complex
beer
but
not
everyones
cup
of
tea
pun
intended
i
liked
it
and
thought
it
was
decent
but
its
not
an
all
nighter
pure
white
microfoam
head
which
diminishes
swiftly
thick
streaks
of
lacing
slides
down
quickly
glowing
golden
haze
in
the
glass
more
orange
bronze
in
the
middle
widely
dispersed
bubbles
appear
throughout
juniper
wood
smoke
orange
peel
persimmon
to
peach
fruit
and
clove
stick
forceful
in
the
nose
whereas
the
individual
scents
have
considerable
intensity
youre
more
impressed
by
the
collective
lift
into
a
wet
perfumed
cloud
fullbodied
thick
foamy
carbonation
makes
it
denser
and
more
blocklike
so
while
theres
air
pockets
present
you
get
more
of
a
totally
full
sensation
cheektocheek
lemon
grapefruit
citrus
like
meringue
pie
the
clove
and
juniper
add
muskiness
to
the
floral
touches
persimmon
peach
apricot
pear
fruit
close
to
kiwi
or
papaya
without
the
juiciness
the
light
smokiness
is
sweet
throughout
the
breadiness
like
a
warm
waffle
the
sour
tea
leaf
comes
through
doesnt
add
much
sweetness
in
turn
the
strength
in
the
flavors
ensures
an
extended
finish
overall
a
unique
experience
fun
to
try
but
not
an
everyday
beer
that
i
would
expect
many
to
want
on
a
daily
basis
interesting
beer
with
interesting
ingredients
unorthodox
but
very
drinkable
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
a
the
color
of
wet
straw
minimal
head
ever
so
slightly
on
the
side
of
opaque
3
50
s
the
juniper
berries
mentioned
on
the
label
dominate
the
nose
a
slight
woody
aroma
what
i
perceive
as
ginger
4
00
t
there
is
an
unusual
sweetness
to
the
beer
that
i
cant
pinpoint
similar
to
pureed
raisins
though
that
could
very
well
be
the
juniper
possibly
a
little
honey
in
the
beer
i
read
that
the
beer
was
fermented
with
a
weizen
yeast
and
that
definitely
imparts
some
clove
flavors
a
touch
of
alcohol
is
evident
also
a
hint
of
wood
in
the
beer
3
50
m
slightly
syrupy
3
50
d
this
is
my
first
sahti
beer
so
i
dont
have
much
to
which
to
compare
but
i
must
say
i
find
it
quite
enjoyable
at
the
same
time
the
sweetness
factor
is
a
little
on
the
high
side
which
means
it
has
its
limits
in
my
book
3
75
d
a
slightly
creamymalty
example
w
plenty
of
spiciness
of
chai
and
earthy
seed
like
qualities
a
very
quaffable
brew
quite
a
tasty
version
of
a
sahti
i
am
glad
i
got
the
bottle
which
i
preferred
over
the
draft
version
d
did
not
like
this
one
at
all
d
for
a
9
brew
this
is
super
drinkable
none
of
the
taste
aspects
ever
get
out
of
hand
sweetness
medicinal
spice
etc
and
the
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
which
is
hit
and
miss
with
other
dfh
brews
while
the
carbonation
is
a
little
burning
it
never
gets
bloaty
i
think
all
of
us
were
sad
when
the
bottle
was
emptied
and
i
strongly
considering
walking
over
the
armanettis
to
get
another
one
until
i
realized
it
closes
early
on
sundays
cool
label
as
is
expected
from
dfh
pours
a
hazy
orange
brown
color
with
a
large
fluffy
peach
colored
head
nice
lively
aroma
chai
tea
corriander
clove
honey
banana
and
a
unique
bitterness
very
sweet
honey
notes
again
some
low
laying
smokiness
some
spice
slightly
bitter
and
herbal
on
the
late
finish
viscous
but
soft
in
body
with
no
alcohol
heat
nothing
screams
juniper
except
for
that
late
bitterness
and
its
more
twiggy
than
fruity
not
sure
if
this
one
was
worth
the
hyped
up
waiting
period
but
a
damn
fine
beer
none
the
less
better
have
friends
with
you
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
sweet
beers
more
so
picture
a
sweet
hefe
with
9
abv
ahh
after
months
of
waiting
sahtea
is
finally
here
by
far
one
of
the
most
creative
unique
though
of
course
something
is
unique
or
it
isnt
there
isnt
a
gradient
of
uniqueness
and
interesting
beers
from
dogfish
yet
to
the
extent
that
assuming
youve
done
just
a
basica
level
of
research
into
the
beer
before
trying
it
the
level
of
anticipation
is
fairly
huge
the
pout
is
a
surprisingly
vibrant
orange
with
a
slight
whitish
head
looks
sort
of
like
orange
soda
moreso
than
say
dayquil
with
some
deeper
hues
in
the
center
the
aroma
is
spicy
very
complex
the
chai
has
a
strong
presence
there
is
a
hint
of
maybe
smoke
from
the
hot
rocks
the
flavor
is
also
extremely
complex
strong
chai
presence
though
i
dont
like
chai
tea
really
and
i
do
like
the
beer
a
bit
of
fruitiness
from
the
juniper
and
a
lot
of
complex
spices
in
it
not
spice
like
black
pepper
in
a
belgian
style
just
a
strange
tealike
spice
complexity
mouth
and
drionkability
are
typical
of
dogfish
ales
mouth
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
fullbodied
and
is
somewhat
reminiscient
of
a
hefeweizen
as
is
its
drinkability
it
is
very
very
easily
drinkable
i
could
see
drinking
2
bottles
and
it
hides
the
abv
quite
well
all
around
it
isnt
mindblowing
but
it
is
very
good
and
extremely
interesting
certainly
not
like
anything
else
ive
ever
had
overall
i
was
slightly
disappointed
dogfish
head
is
my
favorite
brewery
but
this
and
the
theobroma
despite
the
unique
ingredients
and
history
behind
them
have
not
had
the
punch
that
their
other
rarer
beers
have
sahtea
is
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
for
hefeweizen
lovers
but
the
taste
wasnt
anything
exceptional
ontap
at
the
brewpub
served
in
a
small
pilsner
glass
appeared
a
bright
but
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
i
know
sam
put
a
lot
of
work
into
this
but
to
me
it
really
just
tastes
like
an
overspiced
wit
theres
a
hit
of
sweet
fruity
berries
and
juniper
spice
plus
a
not
of
black
pepper
but
this
beer
comes
off
like
a
mess
and
its
hard
to
understand
the
layers
that
were
put
into
it
for
what
its
worth
id
suggest
dialing
the
recipe
back
a
bit
and
letting
more
individual
flavors
standout
d
i
can
tell
this
is
good
i
am
not
sure
if
it
my
stlye
but
good
first
sammy
c
digs
out
the
old
odense
ale
in
a
collaboration
with
nb
now
this
nothing
like
playing
old
bsides
people
havent
heard
in
a
while
or
ever
this
is
a
fine
offering
that
drinks
quite
well
maybe
the
heft
and
viscosity
make
it
at
least
somewhat
of
a
sipper
but
its
enjoyable
all
the
way
through
nice
job
i
liked
this
beer
and
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
however
at
ten
bucks
a
pour
it
is
not
easy
to
afford
light
body
creamy
but
crisp
carbonation
very
nice
poured
a
hazy
straw
gold
with
thin
bright
white
head
good
retention
and
some
nice
sticky
lacing
smells
of
fruits
citrus
wheat
honey
yeast
spices
and
some
musty
attic
tastes
of
oranges
melon
and
pears
up
front
then
honey
wheat
yeast
banana
and
clove
along
with
some
other
spices
like
coriander
and
ginger
some
funky
earth
notes
make
an
appearance
before
some
lemon
zest
finishes
off
the
flavor
palate
medium
in
body
with
great
carbonation
very
light
but
poppy
smooth
and
crisp
very
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
and
unique
bottle
this
and
put
it
in
the
right
hands
and
youve
got
a
great
rival
to
wine
for
something
to
drink
alongside
food
please
somebody
tell
them
to
put
this
in
a
champagne
bottle
and
let
us
all
have
some
more
of
what
might
be
the
most
wellbalanced
thing
to
ever
flow
from
our
friends
at
dogfish
head
this
stuff
is
great
bartender
poured
it
for
me
kind
of
looked
like
a
weizen
at
first
smelled
like
a
weizen
kind
of
tasted
like
one
ive
never
had
a
saison
before
this
one
is
really
drinkable
wonderful
sweet
taste
drink
this
one
before
its
gone
or
tell
dogfish
head
to
make
this
the
beer
that
makes
it
out
of
the
rehoboth
brewpub
into
production
i
guess
i
wasnt
that
far
off
i
googled
to
find
the
serving
temperature
recommendation
and
it
said
about
40
degrees
but
based
on
the
thick
rich
sweetness
of
it
i
figured
it
would
be
better
closer
to
room
temperature
so
i
left
he
last
third
to
warm
up
for
once
i
think
i
was
wrong
i
think
it
was
actually
a
good
bit
better
colder
the
taste
is
so
strong
it
doesnt
get
wiped
out
by
the
cold
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
cloudy
color
with
a
soft
white
head
the
head
dissolved
rather
quickly
to
leave
a
white
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
the
aroma
one
immediately
notices
the
juniper
making
me
think
of
a
gin
and
tonic
at
the
same
time
the
nose
also
reveals
a
strong
dose
of
honey
that
puts
a
sweet
edge
on
the
juniper
this
is
not
like
the
sahtis
i
have
tasted
in
the
past
on
the
initial
taste
honey
and
biscuit
come
to
the
forefront
with
the
bubbles
quickly
brushing
this
away
a
mild
sense
of
fruitiness
is
detectable
as
the
carbonation
mellows
the
juniper
sours
the
honey
in
the
aftertaste
in
the
bigger
sense
the
carbonation
might
be
too
aggressive
as
the
sweetness
fades
too
quickly
into
the
sour
at
the
same
time
the
sour
of
the
juniper
at
the
end
is
the
best
aspect
of
the
taste
i
am
unable
to
saw
that
this
is
my
favorite
sahti
but
it
is
among
the
best
o
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
order
another
or
buy
again
but
i
fairly
enjoyed
it
500
ml
bottle
into
snifter
no

dating
gusher
upon
opening
pours
very
cloudy
reddish
orange
color
with
a
small
1
finger
off
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
very
thin
cap
some
light
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
big
honey
grape
pepper
molasses
raisin
herbal
cherry
floral
citrus
peel
and
yeast

beautiful
aromas
here
with
great
balance
and
complexity
taste
of
caramel
honey
molasses
pepper
grape
raisin
earth
herbal
floral
citrus
peel
banana
and
yeast
spices
lingering
notes
of
caramel
molasses
herbal
floral
grape
pepper
and
yeast
spices
on
the
finish
for
a
while
great
balance
of
flavors
with
absolutely
no
cloying
at
all
medium
carbonation
and
full
bodied
with
a
very
nice
creamy
slick
and
thick
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
at
11
with
only
a
warming
after
the
finish
noticed
definitely
a
slow
sipper
overall
this
is
a
great
sahti
it
felt
a
bit
unbalanced
at
first
but
it
smoothed
out
as
it
reached
room
temperature
really
well
done
o
popped
my
sahti
cherry
i
believe
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
not
drink
often
i
would
drink
again
consumed
from
a
fisheye
pint
glass
this
was
a
nice
surprise
purchased
purely
out
of
curiosity
but
well
worth
finding
again
sahti
probably
goes
well
with
a
rich
meal
but
was
good
on
its
own
overall
probably
more
interesting
fresh
brings
a
lot
of
consistency
and
flavor
somethin
like
an
imperial
sahti
overall
this
was
drinkable
although
a
bit
sweet
but
fairly
unremarkable
and
unmemorable
i
generally
try
to
rate
with
style
in
mind
but
in
the
case
of
sahti
i
am
completely
clueless
o
tough
one
to
judge
i
wanted
to
like
this
but
the
smell
had
me
dry
retching
i
just
couldnt
get
past
it
so
i
had
to
drain
pour
about
half
and
quickly
open
something
else
i
cannot
see
myself
going
for
another
sahti
in
the
future
and
certainly
not
this
one
o
this
is
the
second
real
sahti
ive
had
kataja
olut
was
the
first
and
im
still
intrigued
by
the
possibilities
of
the
style
this
one
is
sweeter
and
a
little
stronger
than
most
but
has
an
absolutely
wonderful
flavor
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
into
quirky
offbeat
ales
overall
nice
honey
brew
and
excellent
complexity
while
i
appreciate
everything
that
is
going
on
in
this
beer
im
not
sure
if
this
is
something
that
i
would
open
every
night
honey
for
the
most
part
masks
the
incredible
strength
of
the
beer
drinkability
this
was
a
phenomenal
experience
certainly
a
winner
here
that
deserves
lots
of
contemplation
a
complex
brew
that
dignifies
old
world
brewing
upcoming
craft
breweries
and
the
inventive
attitude
that
brings
us
there
very
nice
honey
brew
cloaks
the
alcohol
damned
well
poured
a
murky
amber
with
some
brown
in
the
body
minimal
head
which
falls
to
a
white
collar
no
lacing
is
left
behind
nose
has
some
honey
cidery
qualities
notes
of
alcohol
as
well
some
herbal
suggestions
likely
provided
by
the
juniper
twigs
and
artemis
maritima
not
like
i
know
what
they
actually
smell
like
although
the
bottle
indicates
they
were
employed
in
this
brew
taste
has
bigger
notes
of
honey
and
spcing
some
alcohol
and
is
less
cidery
than
the
nose
suggested
berries
come
in
midway
through
the
sip
and
work
with
some
light
grapey
notes
as
well
sweet
all
around
with
some
brown
sugar
as
well
flavour
is
what
ive
been
able
to
identify
as
suitable
to
the
style
but
doesnt
feel
as
pungent
as
dfhs
sahtea
slightly
sticky
feel
pretty
full
in
the
mouth
some
alcohol
comes
in
at
the
end
but
not
at
a
strength
like
the
11
dictates
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
medium
brown
color
with
some
hazy
to
it
the
head
was
pretty
nice
looking
white
thin
and
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
things
going
on
here
the
juniper
is
actually
picked
up
on
the
nose
which
i
like
a
lot
the
other
herbs
in
the
mix
really
work
well
together
to
benefits
this
beer
the
taste
has
a
nice
sweetness
from
the
honey
upfront
which
is
followed
up
right
away
by
many
different
herbal
flavors
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
a
slick
and
a
little
on
the
heavier
side
overall
i
really
like
it
id
like
to
have
it
again
someday
i
enjoyed
this
and
it
went
well
with
a
five
guys
grilled
cheese
and
pomme
frites
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
golden
with
a
somewhat
slight
head
lots
of
honey
in
the
aroma
and
a
touch
of
woody
herbalness
the
taste
also
exhibits
some
nice
honey
notes
up
front
followed
by
a
bitter
juniper
woodiness
the
honey
comes
back
and
moderates
the
juniper
a
bit
but
i
dont
get
the
feeling
that
the
flavors
are
all
that
well
integrated
smooth
and
a
bit
waxy
in
the
mouth
this
seems
a
touch
too
thin
to
me
a
decent
sahti
but
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a
more
harmonious
whole
here
not
familiiar
with
this
style
i
am
left
to
review
the
beer
strictly
as
it
stands
on
its
own
certainly
there
is
nothing
to
complain
about
in
its
appearance
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
crazyhoney
honey
honey
ive
not
had
a
mead
with
as
much
honey
aroma
as
this
no
juniper
or
pine
in
there
as
i
expected
given
the
description
of
the
style
but
no
fusel
or
other
alcohol
flavors
either
at
11
this
beer
is
ridiculously
quaffable
the
only
drawback
is
the
honey
sweetness
not
sure
id
want
a
full
bottle
to
myself
but
i
enjoyed
my
sample
with
some
creamy
goat
cheese
which
made
the
beer
all
the
more
enjoyable
id
recommend
this
paired
with
with
some
rich
creamy
cheese
or
other
fatty
food
to
play
off
the
sweetness
interesting
in
its
own
right
id
love
to
try
some
other
sahtis
to
see
how
they
compare
a
unique
floral
and
perfumy
brew
strikes
me
as
a
good
dessert
beverage
i
wanted
more
juniper
a
decent
brew
but
not
what
i
expected
for
the
style
notes
my
first
sahti
and
it
was
interesting
plenty
of
heather
honey
and
juniper
i
enjoyed
it
but
only
as
a
this
is
fun
to
try
and
drink
not
a
i
want
this
all
the
time
kind
of
beer
it
does
have
a
slight
refreshing
aspect
though
cheers
do
not
being
accustomed
to
the
style
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
going
in
i
wasnt
turned
off
by
any
means
it
was
just
really
sweet
i
definitely
would
like
to
try
others
interpretations
nøgne
ø
sahti
is
a
cloudy
very
lively
amber
brew
with
a
thick
soft
smooth
off
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
strong
honey
aroma
yeah
just
honey
really
strong
its
quite
light
bodied
and
very
lively
with
a
very
clean
dry
finish
it
has
lots
of
honey
flavor
its
lightly
sweet
and
quite
bitter
it
tastes
estery
like
a
belgian
ale
and
a
little
soapy
the
juniper
is
pretty
strong
at
the
finish
theres
a
hot
alcohol
aftertaste
ive
never
tasted
anything
like
this
so
i
have
no
idea
how
to
gauge
it
its
pretty
bizarre
it
kind
of
tastes
like
thunder
blue
snus
o
like
many
nogne
o
beers
the
balance
is
memorable
overall
this
isnt
comparable
at
all
to
the
only
other
sahti
ive
hd
dfh
im
thinking
more
likely
than
not
i
just
got
an
odd
bottle
of
this
sigh
maybe
ill
be
able
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
that
isnt
so
wacky
certainly
a
good
sipper
by
anyones
scale
a
great
latenight
dessert
brew
however
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
and
i
guess
disappointed
that
i
still
have
yet
to
taste
my
first
true
finnish
sahti
sigh
nognedugges
sahti
joins
dogfish
head
sahtea
and
malmgardin
panimo
arctic
circle
ale
as
the
finest
versions
of
this
rather
odd
style
that
have
ever
entered
my
glass
i
would
never
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
but
what
a
mind
and
palate
bending
ride
this
has
been
4
0
d
good
nose
good
taste
and
well
hidden
alcohol
account
for
a
very
drinkable
brew
theres
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
but
it
never
becomes
cloying
this
juniper
thing
might
be
something
worth
looking
into
at
a
homebrewing
level
anyway
no
flaws
and
good
all
around
drinkability
i
appreciate
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
but
im
a
little
disappointed
by
it
the
alcohol
is
so
rich
in
it
that
its
almost
unbearable
i
usually
love
all
of
nøgne
ø
stuff
but
this
collaboration
doesnt
rank
as
high
as
others
i
guess
you
cant
win
them
all
creamy
carbonation
but
could
be
higher
to
help
cut
through
the
sweetness
d
if
this
is
what
all
sahtis
i
have
been
missing
out
a
pleasant
beer
for
the
senses
with
some
unusual
flavoring
in
the
taste
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
d
dangerous
thanks
to
bigdank
for
this
in
a
trade
d
i
like
thios
style
and
this
beer
i
would
definitely
have
another
if
someone
handed
me
the
glass
and
didnt
let
me
taste
it
id
swear
this
was
a
mead
big
honey
smell
with
a
faintness
of
juniper
berries
maybe
some
clove
taste
is
fairly
big
on
the
honey
too
but
you
can
also
taste
the
juniper
and
clove
like
spices
as
well
starts
out
honey
but
fades
out
to
the
other
tastes
it
hides
the
11
very
well
which
is
great
for
cold
nights
it
could
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
definitely
a
great
beer
for
the
holiday
season
actually
i
could
drink
this
in
the
summer
too
probably
get
me
another
bottle
sometime
soon
its
my
favorite
sahti
thus
far
d
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
pours
a
peach
color
with
a
white
head
and
some
nice
spotty
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
citrus
caramel
and
light
spicing
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
a
fairly
large
amount
of
stone
fruit
and
some
tropical
notes
there
are
some
miscellaneous
spices
in
there
toonothing
really
stands
out
the
body
is
medium
and
a
bit
cloying
ultimately
affecting
drinkability
beer
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
it
is
quite
sweet
though
medium
bodied
and
coating
on
the
palate
for
as
high
abv
as
this
beer
is
it
hides
it
well
the
finish
is
a
little
thin
and
moderately
dry
but
overall
its
a
decent
beer
not
as
herbal
as
some
of
the
other
sahtis
ive
had
d
drinking
this
beer
is
an
interesting
change
of
pace
but
theres
no
way
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
due
to
the
amount
of
honey
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
doesnt
taste
anything
like
11
percent
drinkability
is
high
and
it
hides
its
alcohol
content
very
well
over
all
i
think
this
is
a
great
showing
of
the
style
and
of
what
it
was
when
people
first
started
brewing
it
very
drinkable
considering
the
herbal
components
but
at
11
youd
be
wise
to
watch
the
pace
or
things
could
get
out
of
control
before
you
could
say
im
sahti
another
interesting
interpretation
of
a
sahti
one
of
these
days
i
am
going
to
have
to
track
down
a
good
traditional
one
but
until
then
i
continue
to
not
really
be
able
to
get
into
the
interpretations
that
i
can
find
enjoy
one
of
the
better
light
emphasis
on
the
quotes
beers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
and
my
next
bottle
will
not
be
shared
d
holy
crap
this
is
11
wouldve
never
guessed
until
clicking
onto
ba
thats
not
to
say
this
is
especially
drinkable
or
even
likeable
outside
of
a
rare
craving
but
quite
impressive
and
yes
enjoyable
in
its
own
way
not
too
interesting
nor
drinkable
spicey
aroma
floral
cloudy
fruity
colour
yeast
in
taste
with
a
mild
pepper
and
mildly
astringent
juniper
taste
even
moderated
by
the
honey
subdued
fruit
passable
easy
average
mouthfeel
little
carbonation
odd
d
a
little
too
sweet
and
expensive
in
australia
at
least
to
be
sessionable
in
my
opinion
but
would
work
well
as
a
dessert
beer
a
very
flavorful
and
interesting
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
very
unusual
beer
enjoyable
thanks
nick
medium
amber
body
lightly
hazy
with
a
halfinch
cap
sweet
honey
aroma
herbal
and
botanical
floral
rich
smells
pretty
good
very
sweet
on
the
tongue
upfront
honey
with
floral
and
herbal
notes
juniper
is
present
but
resides
behind
the
honey
sweet
and
botanical
finish
with
light
lingering
fruitiness
not
bad
i
couldnt
drink
a
ton
of
this
but
its
fairly
enjoyable
as
i
said
before
this
drinks
like
an
ipa
in
no
way
would
i
guess
this
is
eleven
percent
alcohol
i
really
think
this
style
would
be
more
popular
if
it
was
more
readily
available
and
a
little
cheaper
in
price
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
i
would
have
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
odd
but
not
bad
i
get
notes
of
honey
flowers
and
perfume
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
lot
of
honey
in
the
beer
the
flowery
and
spice
notes
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
probably
from
the
juniper
but
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
plant
so
i
cannot
be
sure
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
sure
how
this
compares
to
other
sahtis
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
slainte
d
with
flavor
like
a
tripelmore
complex
mead
and
only
a
small
alcohol
presence
i
could
drink
these
all
night
unfortunately
have
neither
the
beer
nor
the
alcohol
tolerance
to
do
so
d
while
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
just
dont
think
its
a
style
that
ill
be
looking
to
get
my
hands
on
anytime
soon
again
its
an
interesting
beer
but
ill
pass
next
time
overall
an
interesting
beer
experience
full
body
alcohol
present
but
not
overpowering
glad
i
split
this
one
3
ways
notes
for
me
this
beer
was
absolutely
outstanding
mouthfeel
is
hearty
to
say
the
least
and
even
as
peculiar
as
this
odd
creation
is
i
think
it
drinks
nicely
all
things
considered
drinkability
nice
d
too
high
alcohol
and
heavy
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
its
definitely
complex
and
interesting
enough
to
enjoy
again
i
think
this
style
is
really
interesting
as
an
experiment
at
least
the
traditional
method
of
producing
a
sahti
is
quite
interesting
i
recommend
sharing
this
ale
with
friends
as
a
celebration
of
obscure
brewing
it
has
a
strong
flavor
with
honey
and
juniper
that
is
quite
intriguing
it
would
be
more
risky
but
i
would
have
liked
this
to
be
unhopped
and
100
spiced
with
juniper
the
taste
is
sweet
and
there
is
sugar
honey
juniper
and
various
spices
present
which
work
together
very
nicely
medium
bodied
somewhat
sticky
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
this
is
my
first
sahti
and
i
like
this
one
a
lot
i
saw
a
few
more
bottles
on
the
shelf
when
i
grabbed
this
one
i
should
go
back
and
clean
them
out
d
although
the
alcohol
isnt
necessarily
noticeable
this
style
isnt
really
for
me
the
flavors
are
certainly
interesting
but
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
decent
body
and
enough
carbonation
to
make
this
drinkable
ive
never
had
this
style
before
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
except
my
palate
preferences
no
off
flavors
at
all
so
very
much
worth
exploring
if
you
want
to
try
something
new
if
you
expect
to
quaff
this
with
a
pizza
forget
it
of
the
odder
unique
styles
ive
had
i
like
this
one
the
most
not
something
for
regular
consumption
but
worth
experiencing
i
think
what
kept
me
coming
back
was
the
unique
array
of
flavors
which
are
definitely
fun
to
catalog
sip
after
sip
for
all
those
afraid
to
make
the
jump
this
rare
style
is
definitely
worth
it
this
isnt
an
everyday
beer
by
any
means
but
im
a
fan
its
thought
provoking
and
complex
d
i
didnt
notice
the
alcohol
at
all
but
its
stated
at
11
so
id
have
to
rate
this
dangerously
drinkable
i
had
this
together
with
lebanese
food
and
the
pairing
absolutely
blew
me
away
the
spices
in
the
beer
picked
up
the
spices
in
the
food
better
than
i
had
anticipated
while
the
carbonation
and
sweetness
cut
through
the
heat
of
the
dishes
d
rather
good
drinkability
the
smooth
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
it
not
difficult
to
throwing
a
few
back
the
only
thing
that
might
stop
you
is
the
abv
but
not
in
smell
or
flavor
since
it
is
not
overpowering
at
all
in
those
regards
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
on
any
occasion
that
i
can
d
this
beer
is
delicious
but
the
honey
taste
gets
a
little
overpowering
the
honey
alone
gives
it
the
impression
of
being
very
heavy
and
the
carbonation
preempts
guzzling
its
a
great
beer
for
a
glass
every
so
often
because
nogne
has
definitely
made
a
quality
brew
but
i
couldnt
have
a
lot
in
one
sitting
and
probably
couldnt
finish
an
entire
bottle
before
feeling
a
little
sick
of
it
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
as
a
fun
drink
to
try
and
enjoy
with
loved
ones
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
as
of
late
d
the
flavors
are
so
pronounced
that
i
cant
see
this
being
something
that
i
would
come
back
to
more
than
once
in
awhile
it
is
pleasent
but
not
subtle
at
all
i
could
see
cloyingness
being
an
issue
for
some
d
the
high
abv
is
hidden
but
the
body
and
sweetness
of
this
one
doesnt
earn
extra
drinkability
points
i
like
this
i
want
more
of
this
inside
me
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
the
bottle
says
11
abv
really
theres
hardly
any
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
or
feel
in
here
its
a
surprising
and
pleasant
drinking
beer
this
beer
is
full
bodied
thick
slightly
carbonated
and
a
bit
syrupy
it
has
the
candied
sugars
of
a
belgian
with
lots
of
honey
lots
of
herbal
grassiness
loads
of
sweet
malts
the
brewer
uses
belgian
yeasts
which
are
no
surprise
given
the
slight
prickliness
on
the
tongue
and
there
is
juniper
and
heather
used
as
well
there
is
very
little
hop
in
this
beer
and
it
is
a
strong
and
close
relative
to
a
belgian
tripel
or
quad
there
is
a
slight
tanginess
to
the
beer
maybe
a
touch
of
tangerine
it
is
a
very
good
sipping
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
there
is
some
warming
abv
on
the
back
end
but
zero
throaty
burn
and
no
real
aftertaste
or
aftershock
with
this
one
the
rye
and
wheat
add
to
the
pricklishness
without
detracting
from
the
sweetness
you
can
taste
a
hint
of
some
rye
dryness
on
the
back
end
but
it
really
buried
underneath
lots
of
sweeter
malts
this
is
a
real
find
and
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
a
little
weird
and
probably
closer
to
a
traditional
sahti
than
the
dfh
version
which
is
the
only
other
one
ive
had
but
good
in
general
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
if
you
are
looking
for
something
unique
and
different
give
it
a
try
you
will
not
be
disappointed
i
had
a
full
halbe
of
this
so
the
11
do
become
noticeablr
though
you
cannot
really
taste
them
as
such
fullthrottle
honey
spiked
with
bitter
juniper
and
bitter
lemon
dominates
the
flavor
quick
and
simple
hot
and
dry
weirdly
herbal
and
floral
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
my
first
sahti
and
therefore
i
have
no
real
frame
of
reference
by
which
to
judge
it
but
i
will
say
that
if
all
sahtis
taste
like
this
then
i
very
much
enjoy
the
style
d
this
is
my
first
foray
into
the
world
of
sahti
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
so
i
guess
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
is
the
best
sahti
i
have
ever
tasted
in
my
whole
life
of
course
its
also
the
worst
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
try
more
nøgne
ø
and
dugges
ale
did
a
nice
job
with
a
style
that
continues
to
intrigue
me
id
say
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
im
still
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
it
nonetheless
this
is
good
beer
the
nose
could
use
more
strength
but
thats
about
the
only
constructive
comment
i
have
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
am
surprised
that
it
is
11
abv
it
doesnt
seem
anywhere
near
that
strong
if
you
havent
experienced
sahti
the
style
this
is
a
fine
place
to
start
easily
recommended
i
am
truly
not
sure
where
to
rate
this
beer
im
going
to
err
on
the
side
of
the
beer
though
because
i
did
enjoy
it
the
sahti
turned
into
a
real
sipper
toward
the
end
wow
this
beer
really
changes
a
lot
as
it
warms
i
may
have
this
again
just
because
i
am
so
unsure
friend
but
i
like
it
a
lot
da
very
interesting
beer
the
taste
is
potent
which
lessens
the
drinkability
somewhat
but
the
unique
taste
makes
this
well
worth
trying
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
though
i
have
to
admit
i
am
not
sure
how
well
this
conforms
to
the
style
overall
an
extremely
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
i
really
liked
this
and
it
didnt
cost
me
an
arm
and
a
leg
either
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
glad
to
knock
another
style
off
the
list
sahti
check
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
but
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
with
a
little
more
carbonation
and
at
11
the
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
taste
is
also
unique
somewhat
sweet
with
a
medicinal
finish
first
time
with
a
sahti
so
descriptions
are
failing
me
i
like
it
though
nice
presence
on
the
palate
with
an
excellent
drinkability
at
11
d
sahti
isnt
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
im
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
this
unique
style
of
brew
drinkability
this
was
my
first
ever
sahti
ive
wanted
to
try
one
but
couldnt
ever
find
one
until
this
day
it
was
a
very
unique
beer
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
if
you
ever
want
to
try
something
for
the
old
days
and
unique
at
the
same
time
then
crack
open
your
wallet
and
try
this
beer
like
most
nøgne
beers
it
will
get
pricey
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
very
interesting
beer
to
the
senses
i
like
it
on
this
cool
night
an
interesting
beer
and
one
well
worth
drinking
a
curious
style
too
which
i
would
like
to
find
more
of
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv

a

stiff
foam
over
a
cloudy
peach
colored
brew
wow
the
nose
is
fresh
honey
yeasty
funk
herbal
notes
but
little
apparent
carbonation
the
flavor
is
rich
malts
up
front
dark
honey
again
and
a
crazy
juniper
hoppy
herbal
tea
aftertaste
mouthfeel
starts
round
trending
toward
a
bit
of
astringency
with
that
herbalhops
mixture
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
theres
a
bit
of
a
gin
kind
of
thing
coming
up
in
the
burps
the
big
surprise
for
me
drinking
this
was
the
freshness
and
presence
of
the
honey
itself
usually
its
been
metabolised
by
the
yeast
and
its
contribution
to
the
mix
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
a
lot
of
white
wine
style
dryness
this
isnt
for
everyone
but
it
is
interesting
and
it
does
grow
on
one
now
that
hops
are
a
little
over
and
sourness
is
the
next
big
thing
maybe
itll
be
weird
botanical
infusions
waiting
in
the
wings
if
you
see
some
of
this
you
really
ought
to
try
some
drinkability
is
decent
like
a
dipa
in
intensity
with
a
solid
pine
and
alcoholic
character
well
done
but
not
all
that
drinkable
due
to
the
richness
and
intensity
d
drinkability
was
average
but
guessing
decent
per
style
the
taste
is
quite
odd
but
does
get
more
manageable
as
the
drink
progresses
but
still
comes
with
a
little
fight
going
down
honestly
this
is
quite
an
odd
style
of
beer
that
was
intriguing
but
may
be
a
little
much
to
consume
at
one
time
both
volume
and
alcohol
wise
11
i
would
recommend
splitting
with
a
friend
and
you
might
enjoy
the
experience
a
bit
more
pours
a
hazy
medium
orangeyamber
color
with
generous
white
head
nose
is
quite
assertive
with
herbs
honey
and
a
medicinal
quality
honey
is
up
front
on
the
palate
as
well
with
some
malt
sweetness
fruity
berry
flavors
in
the
middle
and
the
finish
is
moderately
long
with
herbal
flavors
d
a
drinkable
beer
though
ill
admit
this
is
the
only
sahti
ive
ever
tried
so
i
have
no
frame
of
reference
still
a
solid
beer
overall
i
thought
this
one
was
very
nicely
done
rich
and
smooth
with
a
really
well
done
profile
i
really
enjoyed
nearly
every
sip
of
it
and
think
the
juniper
and
berries
added
in
the
mix
really
rounded
out
the
flavor
quite
nicely
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
this
one
again
pours
a
hazy
honey
brown
color
with
a
dense
khaki
colored
head
that
settled
a
chunky
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
herbal
and
floral
honey
malt
with
lavendar
talc
banana
grass
and
hints
of
lemon
quite
unique
the
taste
starts
off
quite
herbal
talcum
powder
basil
rye
light
juniper
and
transfers
into
a
more
floralfruity
flavor
banana
lavendarwild
flowers
apples
and
lemon
all
of
this
is
wrapped
up
with
a
raw
honey
sweetness
the
feel
is
quite
thick
but
is
heavily
carbonated
so
it
drinks
fine
sweet
overall
a
touch
sticky
a
very
unique
brew
i
appreciate
the
herbalfloral
characteristics
quite
flavorful
the
brew
is
a
tad
thick
and
sticky
not
sure
but
i
figure
the
herbalfloral
character
while
tasty
could
become
cloying
though
i
think
12ozs
are
safe
abv
is
well
hidden
well
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
but
if
you
dont
like
gin
or
a
strong
essence
of
honey
in
your
beer
i
would
definitely
steer
clear
this
isnt
a
simple
brewed
with
spices
beer
no
no
the
botanicals
are
not
relegated
to
a
supporting
role
here
highly
suggested
for
fans
of
honey
gin
or
absinthe
id
like
to
have
this
as
a
sahti
staple
in
my
fridge
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
honey
sweetness
and
the
herbal
juniperness
dont
really
notice
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
do
feel
it
a
little
i
have
no
idea
how
this
compares
to
a
traditional
sahti
i
am
glad
i
have
tried
this
but
i
will
have
to
think
about
it
before
deciding
i
want
another
bottle
complex
with
unique
flavor
profile
for
sure
drinkability
is
so
so
too
much
honey
for
me
and
if
i
want
some
funk
i
would
go
drink
an
orval
d
wow
this
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
wow
the
juniper
is
quite
subtle
enhancing
and
contrasting
the
dominant
and
extraordinary
honey
and
malt
flavors
but
never
coming
to
the
front
there
is
a
great
deal
of
complexity
here
and
a
richness
that
lends
this
beer
to
sipping
and
reminds
me
in
a
strange
and
very
positive
way
of
some
of
the
better
english
old
ales
and
barleywines
i
have
no
idea
if
this
would
age
well
and
likely
no
opportunity
to
find
out
but
it
does
make
me
wonder
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
malt
tea
and
i
know
this
because
during
a
batch
of
homebrew
i
tried
some
of
the
mash
from
a
heavy
2
row
malt
backed
beer
the
honey
tastes
natural
and
is
a
nice
touch
to
the
beer
im
assuming
this
is
characteristic
of
the
style
there
really
isnt
much
more
to
the
taste
but
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
yet
highly
carbonated
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
i
am
under
the
impression
that
this
was
a
dying
style
id
like
to
try
others
offerings
for
comparative
purposes
a
sipping
beer
i
got
through
a
full
bottle
with
no
difficulty
which
i
think
is
as
best
you
can
say
for
a
beer
of
this
nature
wont
be
a
regular
but
im
glad
i
gave
this
a
go
overall
i
have
only
had
two
sahtis
in
my
life
this
and
dfh
and
i
seem
to
enjoy
dfhs
version
more
this
one
is
just
too
spiced
up
for
me
it
isnt
bad
and
definitely
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
would
buy
often
d
this
beer
was
certainly
a
whole
new
experience
for
me
id
never
had
a
sahti
so
i
had
no
idea
what
id
be
getting
outside
of
reading
the
style
guidelines
even
with
its
high
abv
this
beer
goes
down
easily
a
truly
unique
experience
that
im
glad
i
didnt
pass
up
d
i
think
the
problem
with
this
beer
for
me
while
well
made
and
interesting
is
that
they
tried
to
make
a
sahti
11
the
flavours
in
the
beer
just
cant
stand
up
to
that
much
alcohol
even
with
the
meadlike
characteristics
of
the
honey
nevertheless
i
think
its
worth
a
purchase
since
it
is
a
very
rare
style
and
the
complexities
are
intriguing
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
im
not
going
to
go
back
to
it
especially
at
the
9
pricetag
the
aroma
refreshing
making
each
sip
is
such
a
delight
and
11
i
would
have
never
guessed
edit
jesus
seriously
11
i
never
never
would
have
guessed
i
was
thinking
78
wow
im
impressed
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amberorange
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
herbal
juniper
and
lavender
with
a
solid
meadlike
character
it
is
a
very
strong
aroma
and
has
nice
complexity
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
herbs
honey
and
a
considerable
alcohol
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
the
first
sahti
ive
tasted
and
i
really
like
it
i
would
really
like
to
see
some
american
craft
breweries
tackling
this
rare
style
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
amber
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
that
forms
into
a
thin
layer
across
the
top
of
the
glass
and
staysit
has
a
dominant
aroma
of
honey
laden
flowers
almost
like
u
have
just
put
ur
nose
to
a
daffodil
flower
the
dominant
floral
aroma
is
definately
the
strongest
i
have
smelt
everand
the
taste
is
definately
different
with
flavours
of
honeyflowers
and
spicy
grainish
yeasts
def
a
new
taste
for
me
it
has
an
average
mouthfeel
and
suprisingly
enough
the
abv
is
well
hidden
for
a
beer
of
11glad
ive
tried
a
true
sahti
just
prefer
my
hop
driven
beers
and
the
floral
aromataste
is
very
dominant
i
think
so
drinkability
for
me
is
average
a
surprising
nose
of
some
sour
definite
berry
golden
tone
wtih
a
substancel
amount
of
murky
sediment
nose
is
sour
berry
and
earth
chalky
earth
some
alcohol
palate
is
an
intense
pollen
flower
and
honey
heavy
sweet
like
that
of
honeysuckle
ends
fresh
and
syrupy
but
back
with
a
nice
earthy
quality
sort
of
mineral
sort
of
woody
pilsner
almost
m
d
easy
sipping
with
the
big
alcohol
content
and
a
rather
full
body
quite
thick
and
just
slightly
syrupy
an
intriguing
beer
but
one
i
would
most
likely
stick
to
sharing
with
company
drinkability
at
11
nothings
really
terrible
drinkable
this
one
has
enough
downsides
due
to
the
high
alcohol
and
not
lessthanevident
alcohol
to
take
it
down
a
few
pegs
but
it
also
has
enough
interesting
and
unique
aspects
to
somehow
make
me
keep
coming
back
for
a
few
more
thanks
to
nøgne
ødugges
for
helping
to
revive
a
nearly
forgotten
style
and
thanks
to
mom
for
her
100
swedish
ancestry
to
which
ill
give
huge
credence
to
for
making
this
so
damn
likable
d
e
l
i
c
i
o
u
s
d
a
slow
drinking
beer
very
enjoyable
the
entire
time
certainly
could
have
had
another
but
probably
no
more
after
that
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
unique
beer
i
really
do
not
understand
how
this
beer
has
a
b
granted
i
feel
bad
saying
how
much
i
disliked
it
especially
considering
that
i
often
like
nogne
a
lot
but
the
flavors
and
aroma
to
this
beer
were
just
soo
weird
that
i
found
it
quite
unpleasant
the
smell
was
like
flowers
and
ammonia
like
urine
honey
fruit
flowers
and
urine
the
pour
is
nice
an
ambercopper
with
thin
white
head
taste
is
very
complex
and
interesting
but
very
flowery
very
strong
juniper
and
sye
not
floral
like
hops
just
flowery
like
fragrance
also
quite
sweet
its
very
strange
mouth
is
fairly
avg
with
a
moderate
body
drink
isnt
heavy
or
such
and
bodywise
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
just
cannot
get
past
the
aroma
and
flavor
and
i
drainpoured
it
taste
with
a
smell
like
that
youd
think
this
beer
would
be
cloying
as
hell
not
at
all
at
least
not
to
the
level
i
expected
the
rye
is
what
really
comes
on
strong
and
gives
flavors
of
baked
goods
especially
when
the
flowery
come
play
around
your
tongue
its
like
a
slice
of
some
kind
of
east
european
dessert
bread
for
such
a
rich
and
complex
brew
i
was
astonished
by
how
well
it
drank
but
what
really
floored
us
was
the
11
abv
very
interesting
beer
from
a
brewery
that
seldom
dissapoints
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
this
one
got
me
to
expand
my
review
wordage
by
a
large
margin
so
something
is
going
on
here
true
to
style
i
am
believing
it
is
not
the
big
abv
and
almost
10
bottle
lowers
drinkability
this
really
struck
me
as
more
of
a
braggot
than
a
sahti
although
ive
only
had
a
small
sip
of
dfhs
and
didnt
take
a
lot
of
notes
but
recalled
it
being
more
junipery
i
could
drink
another
one
of
these
and
would
seek
it
out
but
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
was
11
it
is
not
imo
something
youll
down
several
of
during
the
course
of
an
afternoonnight
this
is
definitely
a
unique
drop
definitely
has
an
odd
flavour
to
it
almost
tastes
darker
than
it
looks
and
feels
a
little
unbalanced
maybe
i
should
say
it
just
feels
untamed
but
its
absolutely
worth
a
drink
a
very
pleasant
refreshing
and
surprisingly
drinkable
brew
i
particularly
liked
the
thickness
in
the
body
which
just
makes
you
have
to
appreciate
all
the
different
flavours
as
you
chew
your
way
through
it
you
know
i
was
expecting
to
say
something
akin
to
not
a
beer
for
everyday
earthy
ive
certainly
never
tasted
a
brew
anything
like
this
very
woodsy
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
winter
beer
and
to
have
a
little
taste
of
my
swedish
heritage
well
done
shareanevadajun
16
lots
of
em
strawberry
stems
particularly
as
its
not
everyday
one
comes
across
a
sahti
enjoyable
interesting
stuff
its
11
abv
and
it
shows
at
first
the
smell
is
much
like
a
belgian
spontaneously
fermented
beer
and
perhaps
the
honey
is
a
little
too
much
in
some
sips
also
warming
and
alcoholic
the
flavour
has
loads
of
honey
too
much
and
malty
sweetness
notes
of
juniper
too
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
flat
looking
amber
color
with
no
head
on
top
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
herbal
with
some
other
odd
aromas
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
is
interesting
lots
of
herbal
juniper
flavors
and
other
things
that
i
cant
honestly
say
ive
tasted
before
i
cant
really
describe
it
the
mouthfeel
was
flat
and
rather
bland
overall
i
think
if
the
carbonation
wasnt
so
low
on
this
one
itd
be
easier
to
drink
and
more
enjoyable
all
around
anyway
good
and
interesting
served
with
a
large
bubble
sudsy
head
the
color
of
the
brew
which
was
a
hazy
dark
amber
aroma
was
spice
licorice
malt
flavor
is
similar
but
butterscotch
is
present
also
plus
a
bit
of
tang
body
and
carbonation
are
true
to
style
finish
is
like
flavor
and
quite
long
seems
to
be
what
a
sahti
is
all
about
except
for
the
butterscotch
which
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
on
cask
at
the
one
pint
pub
this
is
a
2
day
old
cask
straight
from
the
lammin
brewery
this
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
with
almost
no
carbonation
whatsoever
the
owner
of
the
bar
and
one
of
the
brewers
of
the
beer
explained
that
traditional
sahti
should
have
almost
no
carbonation
the
aroma
contains
quite
a
bit
of
banana
caramel
and
just
a
slight
bit
of
juniper
berries
also
just
a
tiny
tartness
is
starting
to
come
through
on
the
backside
of
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
banana
bomb
wow
i
always
thought
that
juniper
should
take
the
first
seat
but
in
this
its
definitely
banana
juniper
comes
through
with
a
bit
of
caramel
the
tartness
is
a
bit
more
pronounced
then
in
the
aroma
for
as
much
emphasis
as
the
brewer
put
in
telling
me
that
it
is
fermented
with
bakers
yeast
and
not
brewers
yeast
i
really
dont
taste
that
much
of
a
difference
overall
its
a
bit
to
much
banana
for
me
i
wish
the
juniper
was
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
it
really
is
a
experience
to
drink
2
day
old
cask
sahti
od
not
a
great
one
by
any
means
mouthfeel
is
weird
and
too
light
seems
like
it
should
be
a
little
syrupy
but
it
comes
as
watery
taste
is
too
mild
imo
wouldnt
seek
it
out
at
all
and
probably
not
a
good
example
of
the
style

it
was
served
but
i
must
assume
that
the
beer
i
sampled
was
farbeyond
the
recommended
freshness
date
overall
this
is
probably
the
most
authentic
sahti
ive
had
the
other
being
nogne
os
interpretation
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
an
obscure
style
for
a
reason
worth
a
shot
for
the
curious
pepper
juniper
and
what
i
can
only
describe
as
pitch
dance
across
your
taste
buds
in
the
finish
while
a
pleasant
tartness
clings
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
long
after
youve
drained
your
last
swig
of
this
rustic
brew
a
good
example
of
a
unique
style
dthe
lack
of
carbonation
takes
away
from
what
is
a
really
interesting
beer
fun
to
try
11
2
ounce
bottle
4
99
deciccos
in
ardsley
ny
they
said
this
only
has
a
shelf
life
of
about
2
weeks
and
they
had
received
it
just
a
few
days
ago
pours
murky
darker
brown
next
to
no
head
no
lace
no
carbonation
no
bubbles
no
nothing
interesting
nose
with
notes
of
spruce
mint
bubble
gum
and
white
wine
in
the
mouth
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
quite
evident
notes
of
jam
more
spruce
mint
white
wine
and
bubblegum
a
distinct
sour
notes
come
through
loud
and
clear
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
in
the
glass
quite
dry
in
the
long
finish
interesting
to
try
but
i
highly
doubt
i
would
reach
for
this
one
again
my
first
of
the
style
i
was
told
great
lengths
were
engaged
to
keep
this
cold
in
transit
as
it
goes
bad
quickly
guess
i
have
to
drink
it
right
away
an
interesting
look
like
an
orangish
ice
tea
some
bubbles
on
the
top
quite
cloudy
smell
is
sweet
and
bubble
gum
like
with
a
hefe
like
wheatiness
taste
is
much
like
a
flat
hefe
with
a
thicker
feel
banana
and
clove
with
a
wheaty
twang
and
more
bubble
gum
some
alcohol
as
well
there
is
a
light
tingly
carbonation
as
it
sits
on
your
tongue
still
this
has
a
somewhat
syrupy
feel
to
it
goes
down
pretty
nicely
on
a
cold
winter
night
not
bad
not
what
you
think
when
you
hear
beer
but
not
bad
at
all
for
6
it
was
a
bit
of
a
novelty
and
a
letdown
dark
ruddy
muddy
orange
brown
no
head
to
speak
of
looks
like
darty
swamp
water
in
the
glass
big
ginberry
junipero
in
the
aroma
juniper
and
spiciness
berries
and
almost
a
suica
like
alcohol
presence
tasteis
similar
a
bit
hot
refreshing
cool
and
unique
twigs
berries
and
other
interesting
flavor
hints
are
there
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
muddled
and
drinkabilityis
decent
but
i
would
not
have
this
style
consistently
mouthfeel
is
quite
syrupy
it
is
very
fruity
sahti
with
some
traces
of
bakers
yeast
finish
is
bit
cloying
still
it
makes
you
want
to
have
another
sip
11
2
ounce
bottle
thanks
mabz
and
as
such
i
rated
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
quite
low
the
mouthfeel
is
as
i
mentioned
earlier
puckery
sour
it
finishes
mildly
dry
but
the
alcohol
is
not
detected
nor
is
a
noticable
hop
bite
i
dont
know
if
this
style
of
beer
even
uses
hops
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
will
probably
try
to
seek
this
stuff
out
fresh
if
im
ever
in
finland
but
if
not
ill
probably
have
to
pass
i
am
very
glad
that
i
was
able
to
endure
this
fearsome
beer
however
it
definitely
worthy
of
seeking
out
for
you
lambic
heads
and
otherwise
exotic
beer
connoisseurs
i
have
to
be
honest
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
this
beer
fresh
as
hell
as
it
was
i
recieved
this
from
mentor
who
tried
it
in
feb
so
who
knows
how
old
this
really
is
now
that
being
said
underneath
all
of
the
funk
is
a
beer
that
had
fresh
i
am
sure
it
a
thing
to
behold
the
color
on
it
is
like
store
bought
ice
tea
mixed
with
a
little
oj
no
head
or
lacing
and
hazy
as
hell
with
lots
of
yeast
sediment
it
smelled
of
citrus
funk
my
first
taste
was
like
biting
into
a
fresh
pinnaple
it
hurt
and
then
smoothed
out
i
drank
this
beer
slowly
and
as
it
got
warmer
more
flavors
evolved
i
could
taste
the
pineyness
mixed
with
some
spice
that
i
have
gotten
to
know
as
rye
the
citrus
flavor
is
like
lime
and
pinnapple
and
a
little
tangerine
the
funk
is
all
over
this
beer
it
has
a
solid
body
despite
all
the
funk
and
is
not
overly
carbonated
cold
and
fresh
is
probably
the
way
to
drink
this
beer
if
i
had
this
not
knowing
what
i
was
drinking
i
could
be
in
a
world
of
taste
bud
hurt
hazy
coppery
tawnygold
in
hue
the
liquid
has
a
lovely
tint
to
it
the
head
was
white
and
active
at
the
apex
the
foam
reached
a
shortlived
half
finger
in
height
in
a
loud
moment
the
head
faded
to
a
fairly
thick
bubbly
collar
animation
was
passing
which
might
help
explain
the
head
development
or
lack
thereof
the
subsequent
lacing
was
very
spotty
i
can
count
the
residue
clumps
on
one
hand
overall
the
appearance
is
admirable
the
nose
is
amazingly
rustic
lammin
kataja
olut
smelled
nothing
like
this
i
liked
the
ale
yeast
better
than
the
bakers
yeast
at
least
in
the
nose
it
starts
off
raw
and
pungent
with
minty
with
methanol
qualities
that
are
very
loud
decayed
leaves
barnyard
funk
grass
hay
pine
needles
melon
juniper
apple
vinegar
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
it
is
very
complex
and
frankly
overwhelming
the
potency
is
high
the
combination
of
smells
is
scary
this
beer
is
some
hardcore
shit
i
cant
call
the
nose
inviting
i
fear
this
beer
and
im
not
ashamed
to
say
that
the
aromas
are
so
far
advanced
over
anything
that
ever
came
out
of
belgium
think
of
the
funkiest
tartest
lambic
youve
ever
smelled
lammin
sahtia
outshines
it
hands
down
however
the
bouquet
in
the
whole
is
not
put
together
all
that
well
the
palate
is
an
odd
mix
of
flavors
just
like
the
nose
the
acidity
is
massive
and
it
reaches
the
belly
and
starts
churning
away
upfront
is
plenty
of
sweetness
but
the
puckering
tartness
raw
juniper
twigs
and
leaves
decaying
fruitgrasshay
overwhelm
this
by
the
middle
overripe
melons
mint
at
the
finish
methanol
and
sour
cherry
candy
and
then
comes
some
red
apples
and
cider
vinegar
with
a
kiss
of
citrus
at
the
very
end
of
the
sip
the
aftertaste
is
tart
and
warm
with
hints
of
orange
peel
and
horse
blanket
if
you
have
grown
tired
of
lambic
and
you
find
even
the
most
adventurous
belgian
creates
tame
now
you
must
drink
this
beer
it
will
blow
your
mind
i
cant
solve
this
beer
it
is
like
staring
at
a
mc
escher
drawing
i
take
a
sip
and
think
about
it
i
detect
more
feelings
that
flavors
maybe
i
can
recognize
the
feelings
easier
after
i
swallow
my
throat
becomes
raw
and
i
feel
like
i
have
the
onset
of
heartburn
my
mouth
feels
sweet
like
i
was
sucking
on
cheap
fruit
candy
but
sour
like
i
had
a
sweet
tart
there
is
acidy
like
really
raw
lemonade
and
then
there
are
all
the
organic
flavors
that
baffle
my
brain
because
they
dont
belong
in
anyway
to
the
previously
mentioned
categories
im
worn
out
medium
in
body
moderate
carbonation
but
at
no
point
does
that
negate
any
aspect
of
the
mouthfeel
or
help
either
if
fact
the
mouthfeel
seems
very
sturdy
at
this
point
of
my
review
i
like
to
add
a
food
pairing
not
for
this
review
i
cant
think
of
anything
that
could
hang
with
this
beer
funky
cheese
maybe
i
didnt
find
this
beer
to
be
drinkable
i
respect
it
thoroughly
i
loved
lammin
kataja
olut
and
i
would
drink
that
again
in
a
heartbeat
i
cant
say
the
same
for
this
sahti
maybe
im
not
worthy
maybe
i
need
to
try
this
beer
again
i
dont
know
if
im
that
brave
i
purchased
this
bottle
from
a
cooler
in
iowa
city
ia
it
is
worth
a
try
for
the
novelty
of
it
unusual
and
different
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
11
2
oz
bottle
obtained
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
in
feb
2005
and
consumed
that
same
evening
no
freshness
date
which
is
a
concern
because
sahti
is
suppose
to
be
served
fresh
well
thats
what
the
ba
article
says
pours
thick
with
noticable
sediment
flowing
into
the
glass
cloudy
and
copper
colored
in
fact
it
looks
exactly
like
fresh
pressed
apple
cider
no
head
formed
only
a
small
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
noticable
piney
yeasty
and
fruity
notes
eminate
from
the
glass
before
i
even
lift
it
for
a
sniff
smells
whoa
funky
belgian
funky
like
beire
de
garde
with
citrus
and
apples
some
alcohol
can
be
detected
with
searching
there
are
many
many
other
scents
in
here
some
of
which
are
familiar
but
which
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
incredible
depth
in
the
smell
i
hope
the
flavor
holds
as
much
character
tastes
sour
tart
fruity
early
on
this
settles
into
a
slightly
less
tart
citric
and
cherry
and
ends
with
an
interesting
woody
and
pine
needle
character
at
this
point
a
stable
neutral
yeasty
flavor
rises
up
to
add
a
new
dimension
below
the
tart
and
the
pine
very
interesting
the
aftertaste
is
yeasty
apples
like
cider
thats
just
beginning
to
harden
and
faint
pine
carbonation
is
low
except
for
a
strong
burst
of
fine
and
acrid
bubbles
on
the
flat
of
my
tongue
as
i
prepare
to
swallow
whoa
the
sour
beer
and
acrid
carbonation
make
for
a
potent
explosion
while
sweet
this
beer
is
quite
dry
later
tastes
as
the
beer
warmed
allowed
the
piney
character
to
be
detected
earlier
and
the
aftertaste
became
less
pleasant
my
mouth
is
getting
tired
of
this
beer
there
is
no
way
i
can
drink
the
other
sahti
i
purchased
this
evening
imagine
a
very
tart
lemonade
on
a
hot
summer
day
how
refreshing
that
first
cool
gulp
is
but
how
old
that
gets
in
a
hurry
the
mouthfeel
is
really
thick
and
i
felt
small
chunks
of
debris
on
my
tongue
too
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
trying
my
other
sahti
tomorrow
kataja
olut
definitely
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
to
hit
my
palate
and
once
you
get
past
the
initial
shock
of
something
so
different
it
really
does
grow
on
you
and
those
theres
sahtis
brewed
outside
of
finland
maybe
are
merely
interpretations
and
not
really
sahtis
fantastic
but
not
for
those
without
an
open
mind
and
palate
drinkability
notes
very
lambic
like
perhaps
the
oddest
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
not
sure
if
i
should
drink
it
or
to
clean
my
hard
wood
floors
with
it
obviously
you
have
to
have
an
acquired
taste
to
like
it
that
is
something
i
dont
have
for
this
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
hardcore
lambic
drinker
like
walleye
in
the
review
before
me
this
was
purchased
at
merchants
fine
wines
in
dearborn
mi
this
was
one
of
the
worst
tasting
beverages
i
have
ever
drank
it
poured
out
to
a
brownish
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
was
that
of
sourdough
bread
but
with
a
off
characteristic
the
taste
was
wretched
sour
beyond
belief
and
totally
undrinkable
the
experience
was
so
bad
i
feel
bad
giving
the
appearance
a
3
5
when
the
beer
itself
was
disgusting
enough
to
be
rated
1s
throughout
this
mustve
been
an
off
batch
for
whatever
reason
terrible
one
of
the
few
complete
drain
pours
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
bought
at
merchants
in
dearborn
was
told
by
the
person
working
the
beer
section
that
the
beer
was
going
to
be
sent
back
not
a
good
batch
stupid
me
i
bought
a
bottle
anyway
poured
copper
with
a
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
aroma
like
the
pickled
turnips
you
get
at
a
mideastern
restaurant
had
a
hard
time
getting
past
that
as
the
nose
was
pulled
away
got
a
hint
of
sweetness
flavor
not
as
bad
as
the
aroma
vinegar
sourness
let
this
sit
and
warm
up
to
see
if
flavor
would
change
it
didnt
the
lammin
sahti
is
a
brilliant
example
of
the
style
thats
a
musttry
you
might
not
like
it
but
you
should
try
it
you
should
also
note
that
because
sahti
is
microbiologically
alive
and
will
not
keep
long
once
it
reaches
its
top
condition
in
less
than
two
weeks
it
should
be
bought
cold
kept
cold
and
consumed
shortly
thereafter
as
they
say
in
finland
kippis
im
glad
i
bought
two
bottles
this
confused
the
living
hell
out
of
me
interesting
ponderous
stuff
i
can
only
guess
how
thrilling
this
would
be
with
thin
slices
of
moist
vollkorn
rye
bread
fermented
seafood
and
beets
o
nasty
it
may
only
be
from
2008
but
its
terrible
this
is
a
straight
drainpour
i
cant
bring
myself
to
take
another
sip
this
sounded
so
cool
with
juniper
im
a
fan
of
gin
and
i
greatly
anticipated
trying
it
but
alas
its
just
not
to
my
taste
poured
only
a
few
soap
suds
bubbles
of
head
and
they
popped
immediately
the
body
is
a
hazy
apple
cider
brown
or
muddy
water
take
your
pick
smells
so
weird
not
at
all
like
the
gin
smell
i
expected
id
say
it
smells
more
vegetal
the
taste
is
like
pickle
juice
only
more
sour
quite
unpleasant
i
dont
know
maybe
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
sahti
style
first
ive
had
of
it
but
i
couldnt
stand
this
it
was
a
pricey
drain
pour
kataja
olut
ivb
is
a
very
clear
solid
caramel
colored
liquid
with
no
head
to
speak
of
it
has
a
sweet
aroma
of
juniper
berries
and
a
host
of
herbs
that
my
nose
cant
identify
theres
something
like
soy
sauce
in
the
background
it
smells
like
a
fortified
wine
not
a
beer
its
medium
light
bodied
flat
and
abrasive
it
kind
of
hurts
my
mouth
this
tastes
like
beer
gone
bad
oxidized
and
infected
its
salty
and
it
burns
i
dont
know
if
this
is
intentional
but
i
suspect
not
down
the
drain
it
goes
theres
no
indication
as
to
when
this
was
bottled
but
it
probably
wasnt
recently
thanks
to
beersack
for
the
share
the
brew
pours
a
murky
and
rustic
deep
caramel
hue
and
is
totally
devoid
of
head
or
signs
of
effervescence
the
rustic
aspect
saves
the
score
i
smell
sweet
caramel
oxidized
vinous
notes
and
perhaps
suggestions
akin
to
plum
wine
the
flavor
is
surprising
as
is
just
about
everything
with
this
brew
the
first
anomaly
is
that
i
do
not
detect
any
trace
of
juniper
or
spruce
i
am
not
sure
whether
this
is
an
older
faded
bottle
or
if
it
always
tastes
like
this
the
taste
is
more
like
an
english
barleywine
as
if
executed
by
a
belgian
brewer
and
is
replete
with
heavy
suggestions
of
toffee
and
dark
fruit
oxidized
vinous
notes
like
a
marsala
wine
some
concord
grape
sweet
fruitiness
that
i
often
find
in
flanders
reds
small
nuances
of
mulled
spices
and
tea
and
a
slightly
lemony
finish
very
complex
the
feel
is
more
lively
than
its
appearance
suggests
and
is
mediumbodied
silky
and
pétillant
enough
to
carry
the
flavors
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
my
first
real
sahti
juniper
and
caramel
with
some
copper
in
the
background
thick
and
sweet
with
a
tangy
aftertaste
not
tart
though
not
bad
think
ill
do
a
little
more
investigation
within
this
style
you
know
just
for
shitz
overall
this
is
superneat
its
kind
of
a
sipping
beer
and
as
a
sahti
this
is
different
than
what
a
lot
of
beer
drinkers
would
expect
not
as
off
the
wall
in
terms
of
sourness
as
a
flemish
beer
but
definitely
exciting
and
worth
a
try
this
beer
was
a
little
too
unique
for
me
i
think
this
beer
pours
from
the
bottle
as
a
hazy
brown
color
and
it
has
a
ton
of
sediment
in
it
the
aroma
is
very
intriguing
its
got
a
lot
of
juniper
and
other
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
but
the
flavor
is
really
strong
the
beer
didnt
have
much
carbonation
at
all
i
just
wasnt
feeling
this
one
too
much
the
cpj
d
not
much
to
recommend
about
this
beer
what
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
really
really
interesting
and
very
very
different
the
body
was
medium
in
density
but
it
had
almost
no
carbonation
i
will
not
seek
this
one
again
but
i
would
like
to
try
other
sahtis
beer
is
thin
and
has
an
odd
dry
finish
ok
it
has
a
very
odd
dry
finish
its
a
little
sweetness
and
not
much
else
to
it
not
a
very
good
beer
could
be
something
totally
different
different
for
sure
and
not
in
all
the
great
a
way
poured
with
almost
no
head
which
is
now
totally
gone
color
is
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
lots
of
sediment
aroma
is
a
pungent
malt
juniper
yeast
wet
cardboard
resin
flavor
is
like
aroma
with
a
tart
edge
almost
no
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
with
a
long
lingering
tartness
and
a
little
alcohol
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
d
this
is
my
first
and
last
of
this
beer
after
first
taste
i
almost
drain
poured
it
but
its
getting
slightly
better
as
i
keep
drinking
it
had
a
dfh
sahti
but
traded
it
need
to
get
a
hold
of
another
to
try
something
that
is
better
in
style
dthis
is
my
first
of
this
style
and
im
not
sure
what
to
measure
it
against
its
simply
an
average
beer
overall
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
some
carbonation
tiny
offwhite
head
with
basically
no
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
nice
spice
notes
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
pretty
tart
with
some
cinnamon
notes
medium
body
drinkable
not
too
bad
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
being
my
first
sahti
i
rated
this
one
based
on
what
i
have
read
to
be
typically
characteristic
of
the
style
as
well
as
subjective
criteria
that
said
this
was
an
interesting
experience
though
i
look
forward
to
hopefully
trying
more
traditional
examples
of
the
style
to
have
some
basis
for
comparison
overall
this
one
is
too
heavy
and
cloyingly
sweet
to
be
very
drinkable
or
enjoyable
pours
a
murky
amber
orange
with
no
head
to
speak
of
precluding
any
discussion
of
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
a
mixture
of
sweet
gingerbread
cinnamon
brown
sugarvanilla
tart
fruity
sour
orange
brett
and
earthy
juniper
pine
spruce
maple
lots
o
stuff
happening
here
thoroughly
whetting
the
appetite
for
some
tasty
stuff
here
goes
remember
all
of
that
sweetness
from
the
nose
forget
most
of
it
as
only
a
bit
of
the
gingerbread
and
cinnamon
remains
the
sour
farmhousestyle
elements
are
there
in
surprising
abundance
with
a
good
amount
of
the
earthy
juniper
and
spruce
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
filling
up
the
back
of
the
tongue
again
theres
a
good
amount
colliding
here
but
its
not
as
pleasant
as
the
nose
the
body
is
deceptively
in
the
medium
range
with
pretty
much
no
carbonation
whatsoever
and
a
texture
mostly
akin
to
water
in
fact
this
brew
really
feels
ver
similar
to
a
kind
of
grainbased
tea
than
a
beer
but
i
suppose
thats
how
this
style
is
meant
to
feel
overall
this
brew
stands
as
a
unique
experience
with
a
fair
drinkability
which
itself
could
increasedecrease
based
on
continued
exposure
to
the
style
and
evolving
feelings
regarding
its
feel
drinkability
interesting
to
say
the
least
will
pick
up
another
to
compare
if
i
ever
see
it
again
my
first
sahti
and
definitely
not
my
last
if
i
can
find
more
an
interesting
beverage
to
be
sure
definitely
oldschool
with
the
forest
floor
flavourings
replacing
those
of
the
hops
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
just
the
one
is
good
this
is
interesting
and
i
do
like
what
the
juniper
brings
to
the
table
but
this
really
isnt
engaging
enough
to
keep
my
interest
this
brew
pours
up
a
murky
rust
color
with
a
couple
individual
bubbles
on
top
not
a
real
head
per
say
the
aroma
is
apples
yeast
mellow
lemons
musky
the
taste
is
slight
juniper
and
slight
malts
and
thats
about
all
the
body
is
terrible
its
just
thin
and
is
the
same
consistency
as
water
no
carbo
just
throws
this
beer
over
the
bridge
for
me
this
is
the
only
sahti
style
beer
ive
ever
had
so
i
cant
really
compare
it
to
anything
except
for
my
urine
and
right
now
my
urine
is
in
the
lead
a
downright
weird
style
of
beer
perhaps
the
folks
at
jolly
pumpkin
could
give
this
a
try
as
an
americanized
version
kataja
olut
is
very
interesting
its
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
i
honestly
believe
id
like
this
beer
with
more
bubbles
the
earthy
juniper
flavor
has
promise
ultimately
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
just
too
big
of
a
problem
for
it
to
overcome
id
be
very
interested
in
giving
another
sahti
a
try
though
it
is
unique
and
is
very
much
worth
checking
out
feel
is
thin
and
watery
with
a
teeny
bit
of
body
to
it
drinkability
is
very
low
flavors
need
to
be
cleared
by
the
nonexistant
carbonation
thats
a
lie
there
is
carbonation
just
hardly
any
at
all
this
beer
pours
out
with
no
head
at
all
my
kids
apple
juice
has
a
more
full
and
frothy
head
no
lacing
at
all
but
it
has
a
nice
color
like
an
old
penny
and
theres
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
floating
around
like
a
weak
snow
globe
smells
sweet
and
fruity
like
maple
syrup
and
lingonberries
tastes
sweet
like
spiced
carmel
and
brown
sugar
no
hop
presence
very
unusual
beer
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
this
before
its
totally
flat
no
carbonation
i
want
to
open
another
one
to
see
if
this
ones
a
fluke
being
of
finnish
decent
i
wanted
to
give
this
beer
an
outstanding
rating
but
i
can
not
lie
its
decent
but
not
great
its
hard
to
find
suomi
beer
the
more
i
drink
the
more
sisu
i
get
taste
is
like
the
aroma
sweet
honey
slightly
earthy
notes
tea
hard
to
detect
any
juniper
mouthfeel
is
light
no
carbonation
at
all
but
doesnt
necessarily
detract
from
drinkablity
overall
its
okay
recommended
for
those
out
to
try
traditional
styles
but
i
wouldnt
spend
the
money
on
this
one
again
this
is
my
first
sahti
i
really
liked
this
it
had
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
but
it
also
had
a
bit
of
a
tart
taste
too
i
am
starting
to
like
the
sour
type
beers
more
and
more
lambics
saisons
and
now
sahtis
you
can
taste
the
subtle
juniper
taste
in
the
finish
but
up
front
its
more
of
the
fruit
character
there
wasnt
much
of
a
head
if
any
but
the
body
was
a
cloudy
amber
ill
probably
go
get
some
more
before
i
leave
va
drinkability
is
moderate
it
tastes
decent
but
its
not
awesome
d
this
beer
has
lots
of
flat
qualities
to
it
that
i
cant
tell
if
it
is
old
or
just
bland
the
cider
was
a
bit
odd
but
added
an
interesting
touch
if
only
there
were
other
flavors
to
it
this
was
a
pretty
unpleasant
drink
no
sound
when
the
cap
came
off
and
the
underside
of
the
cap
was
a
greyish
tint
splotchy
and
resembled
zombie
flesh
murky
orange
brown
pour
no
head
smelled
musty
and
sweet
no
discernable
aromas
flavor
not
much
really
herbal
and
tealike
but
so
muted
that
there
was
little
to
take
away
from
it
especially
not
any
clear
juniper
flavor
zero
carbonation
flat
and
watery
yet
it
still
had
an
unpleasant
weight
in
the
mouth
no
hint
of
7
thats
good
i
guess
this
may
have
been
an
old
bottle
forgotten
on
the
shelf
at
friar
tuck
in
central
illinois
the
sharp
looking
red
label
will
always
serve
as
a
reminder
to
the
horrors
lurking
in
that
bottle
avoid
d
i
suppose
that
given
the
choice
between
this
and
water
in
16th
century
finland
id
have
to
go
with
this
d
while
i
am
glad
someone
is
still
making
this
style
i
have
only
had
two
examples
so
it
is
hard
for
me
to
judge
definately
different
and
worth
trying
at
least
once
thanks
bill
d
glad
to
try
this
one
doubt
id
seek
the
style
out
actively
again
though
poured
an
11
2oz
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
this
beer
pours
a
copperish
red
with
exactly
7
bubbles
i
counted
just
kidding
but
seriously
there
was
just
a
tiny
bit
of
escaped
gas
when
i
popped
the
top
so
im
pretty
sure
its
mostly
flat
whether
or
not
this
is
par
for
the
style
i
dont
know
no
lacing
at
all
is
present
but
a
several
heavily
coagulated
participates
did
join
the
beer
in
the
glass
when
i
poured
it
i
dont
know
if
it
was
yeast
or
proteins
the
aroma
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
harsh
grain
aroma
floating
around
in
the
background
the
taste
is
interesting
but
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
the
taste
is
sweet
vaguely
orangey
with
again
that
harsh
grainy
think
ethanol
without
the
burn
flavor
also
a
slight
piney
taste
is
noted
on
the
very
end
of
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
astringent
as
for
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
will
be
drinking
it
again
unless
i
can
for
sure
guarantee
it
is
a
fresh
bottle
having
said
all
that
its
actually
easy
to
drink
and
i
give
it
credit
for
that
not
thrilled
with
my
first
sahti
but
maybe
thats
because
i
dont
know
the
style
good
marks
for
drinkability
i
could
have
gone
for
another
as
soon
as
i
was
done
drinkability
is
decent
this
brew
is
not
bad
provided
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
flat
apple
juice
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
somewhat
flabby
in
profile
without
enough
richness
to
sustain
the
malts
edit
after
writing
my
review
i
read
the
brothers
review
and
it
doesnt
seem
like
the
same
beer
at
all
i
bought
this
beer
at
bruisin
ales
in
asheville
right
after
they
got
it
in
i
suspect
that
my
example
is
what
a
fresh
example
tastes
like
and
what
the
bros
drank
is
more
what
it
turns
into
after
it
has
been
in
the
bottle
awhile
which
way
is
it
supposed
to
be
drunk
who
knows
but
im
pretty
sure
id
prefer
it
fresh
d
an
interestng
beer
from
finland
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
taste
and
its
lightness
made
it
real
easy
to
drink
it
lasted
all
of
5
minutes
certainly
would
like
to
try
another
example
of
this
style
d
its
a
little
odd
and
im
not
entirely
sure
its
to
style
ill
have
to
seek
out
another
example
medium
bodied
smooth
due
to
lack
of
carbonation
and
slightly
syrupy
as
well
i
am
torn
with
this
one
i
kind
of
like
the
flavor
and
it
grew
on
me
but
a
couple
of
sips
was
enough
i
think
if
it
had
more
carbonation
and
crispness
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
something
different
to
give
a
try
average
beer
nothing
else
murky
orange
in
color
with
no
head
whatsoever
not
what
id
call
an
attractive
beer
but
perhaps
its
at
least
true
to
style
the
taste
and
aroma
are
both
quite
syrupy
and
herbal
bringing
to
mind
candied
fruits
toffee
and
gin
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
still
interesting
stuff
but
i
cant
say
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
the
beer
itself
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
mellow
malt
and
juniper
aroma
the
taste
doesnt
change
much
but
a
slight
tang
reminds
me
of
a
strong
euro
lager
basically
this
is
a
simple
beer
a
bit
of
a
novelty
but
worth
trying
if
like
in
my
case
its
the
only
sahti
you
have
access
to
pours
a
hazed
amber
brown
with
no
head
nose
is
like
an
old
ale
a
bit
beyond
that
a
bit
yeasty
and
sugary
but
just
a
touch
kind
of
a
floral
character
there
as
well
flavor
is
again
kind
of
like
an
old
ale
with
a
touch
of
belgian
sweetness
a
bit
unique
feel
is
low
on
bubble
and
slightly
thicker
with
a
syrup
like
feel
very
drinkable
yes
mouthfeel
very
very
little
carbonation
syrupy
full
bodied
finish
is
short
dissipating
quickly
not
much
going
on
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
from
the
33oml
bottle
head
is
smallish
evaporates
quickly
leaving
a
patchy
bit
of
lace
nose
is
sweet
earthy
with
a
musty
aroma
start
is
quite
sweet
top
is
medium
in
feel
finish
is
flat
sweet
dry
and
different
first
of
this
style
i
have
tried
drinkable
7
percent
abv
do
not
quite
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
this
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
i
think
ill
have
trouble
finishing
this
one
aroma
was
a
pleasant
whiff
of
caramel
with
the
piney
undertones
but
then
the
quaff

a
sweet
sugary
caramel
blend
almost
like
a
soda
the
flat
and
watery
body
doesnt
add
anything
of
benefit
somewhat
like
a
sweet
and
weak
barleywine

but
this
is
one
style
i
wont
be
headed
back
too
anytime
soon
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
that
is
very
unique
similar
to
a
lambic
but
with
no
carbonation
with
that
being
said
my
preference
is
to
have
that
carbonation
i
find
myself
taking
little
sips
as
it
feel
odd
in
my
mouth
without
the
carbonation
plus
the
flavor
being
so
different
than
most
other
beers
this
is
certainly
one
i
am
glad
i
got
to
explore
but
the
style
is
just
not
for
me
my
first
sahti
i
suppose
since
i
have
never
had
another
sahti
to
know
what
is
representative
of
the
style
this
review
was
interesting
pours
a
coppery
brown
with
little
to
no
head
vinous
aroma
with
a
hint
of
cidery
tartness
and
freshly
cut
apple
slices
caramely
booziness
lurks
in
the
background
fruity
flavors
aboundwith
hints
of
pear
and
macintosh
apple
mingling
with
a
caramelized
sugar
sweetness
topped
off
with
a
slight
tartness
strangely
viscous
yet
thin
mouthfeel
with
an
extremely
clean
finish
not
what
i
expected
and
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
bad
way
could
benefit
from
a
little
more
carbonation
opinion
well
obviously
this
beer
could
have
been
better
presented
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
if
it
was
a
fresh
example
because
what
i
have
here
is
in
no
way
indicative
of
what
the
brewer
intended
a
welcome
addition
to
pazzos
lexington
ky
maybe
my
first
sahti
the
beer
opens
with
a
surprisingly
viscous
appearance
heavy
malty
rusty
and
quite
hazy
in
appearance
head
retention
was
lacking
compared
to
most
wee
heavys
and
scottish
ales
which
have
similar
appearances
aromas
are
very
malty
bready
and
fruity
dehydrated
figs
plumbs
pears
raisons
grapes
and
berries
mild
tartness
touches
a
bit
on
a
vineous
side
flavors
of
heavy
sweet
malts
prevail
maybe
marris
otter
malts
richly
bready
and
yeasty
the
dark
fruits
gain
intensity
throughout
the
session
and
as
the
beers
warm
becomming
tart
spicy
and
estery
late
the
balance
remains
heavy
toward
the
sweetness
with
a
complementary
juniper
berry
flavor
and
woodiness
constant
in
the
background
the
feel
is
weighted
but
not
as
heavy
as
the
appearance
suggests
the
alcohols
thin
the
body
a
bit
and
add
complexity
to
the
tart
berry
character
finishes
expectedly
sweet
with
a
long
woody
lingering
very
complex
and
rich
even
with
light
hop
additions
if
any
hops
were
used
at
all
a
wellrounded
complex
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
not
the
cleanest
tasting
of
beers
but
no
obvious
offflavors
certainly
worth
a
try
for
any
bold
english
scottish
ale
lovers
who
may
want
a
touch
of
belgian
ale
characteristics
pours
out
a
still
dark
marmalade
with
no
head
smells
extremely
malty
and
worty
with
some
toasty
breadlike
qualities
juniper
is
really
far
in
the
background
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
good
amount
of
fruity
esters
again
the
juniper
is
pretty
understated
but
overall
this
is
pretty
flavorful
almost
has
a
tealike
quality
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
flat
and
the
body
is
moderate
tasty
all
around
but
id
be
interested
in
trying
other
interpretations
of
the
style
to
see
if
i
could
find
more
with
a
bigger
juniper
character
this
beer
pours
a
pretty
bland
ambergolden
color
with
absolutely
no
head
the
minimal
amount
of
bubbles
that
it
does
have
seem
to
swirl
in
the
center
of
the
glass
for
a
while
after
poured
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
grains
and
has
a
strong
earthy
punch
to
it
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
as
well
very
monolithic
and
almost
reminds
me
of
a
malt
beverage
as
there
is
no
hop
character
or
real
grain
distinctness
the
absence
of
any
kind
of
carbonation
again
makes
me
think
of
a
malt
beverage
and
really
makes
this
a
boring
beer
to
drink
the
only
good
part
is
there
is
no
taste
of
alcohol
even
though
its
around
7
not
much
going
on
here
flavor
doesnt
exactly
jump
out
at
you
interesting
but
thats
about
it
bottle
into
snifter
a
no
head
whatsoever
hazy
amber
color
s
sweet
berries
caramel
malts
honey
t
citrus
notes
very
malty
and
sweet
a
slightly
bitter
finish
with
the
juniper
coming
through
m
watery
no
carbonation
d
at
first
its
a
little
offputting
with
the
thin
mouthfeel
and
complete
lack
of
any
carbonation
but
the
juniper
flavor
is
really
interesting
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
the
katalja
olut
ivb
is
the
first
sahti
ive
ever
tried
and
all
i
know
of
the
style
is
whats
published
on
ba
it
pours
semiclear
copper
and
looks
and
smells
a
little
like
a
spicy
cider
the
smell
is
definitely
unique
and
enticing
but
with
no
head
and
little
carbonation
its
hard
to
even
think
of
this
as
beer
the
barely
perceptible
carbonation
was
a
significant
detractor
in
the
overall
experience
it
makes
this
medium
bodied
brew
seem
almost
syrupy
like
a
half
glass
of
barley
wine
that
was
left
in
the
fridge
overnight
the
taste
is
pleasant
moderately
sweet
followed
by
a
drying
finish
and
a
hint
of
tartness
not
bad
but
for
the
4
11
2
oz
price
tag
i
expected
something
a
little
more
complex
cloudy
almost
opaque
orange
body
with
no
head
dark
bits
of
junk
floating
around
in
the
beer
aroma
is
very
malty
but
from
a
distance
slightly
piney
notes
can
be
discerned
flavor
is
pretty
sweet
with
slightly
roasted
notes
atop
thick
biscuit
malt
flavors
the
maltiness
is
nearly
like
sampling
wort
just
a
slight
bit
of
bitterness
comes
through
but
its
not
bitter
like
hops
astringency
may
be
a
better
term
but
it
balances
out
the
malt
really
well
and
cleanses
the
plate
somewhat
almost
like
adding
a
slice
of
lemon
to
water
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
luscious
this
is
really
an
enjoyable
beer
its
a
malt
lovers
dream
drinkability
is
also
great
because
even
though
its
malty
it
never
gets
cloyingly
sweet
due
to
the
juniper
i
was
prepared
to
be
turned
off
by
this
beer
but
im
really
digging
it
might
have
to
go
buy
a
sixer
and
then
try
to
make
some
myself
highly
recommended
for
those
who
appreciate
malt
and
for
those
who
want
to
experience
different
styles
of
beer
dont
bother
if
youre
purely
a
hophead
pours
halfway
clearandcloudy
with
pretty
much
no
head
and
very
little
carbonation
color
is
medium
amber
with
a
bit
of
muddy
brown
and
little
in
the
way
of
highlights
smell
is
very
fruity
and
interesting
compelling
caramel
malts
apple
fruits
honey
and
some
fruity
sharpness
that
i
have
to
assume
is
from
the
traditional
juniper
berries
it
reminds
me
of
the
aroma
of
an
english
old
ale
actually
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
still
and
very
smooth
with
unfermented
sugars
flavorwise
a
bit
watery
first
off
coupled
with
a
sharp
herbal
juniper
taste
before
thin
caramel
notes
licorice
and
apple
come
out
midway
in
drier
finish
with
some
acidic
fruity
elements
sticking
around
the
palate
for
a
while
overall
this
is
very
interesting
its
the
first
sahti
ive
had
so
i
cant
really
comment
on
its
relative
merit
but
i
can
say
that
i
found
it
enjoyable
over
one
glass
murky
dark
orange
colour
with
a
bit
of
coarse
foam
not
much
lace
but
whats
there
is
fine
and
spotty
very
malty
aroma
with
some
brown
sugar
and
bread
crust
notes
also
very
light
juniper
berry
fruitiness
malty
flavour
but
not
sickeningly
sweet
some
breadiness
brown
sugar
and
caramel
throughout
a
bit
earthy
as
well
and
the
juniper
really
comes
out
towards
the
end
giving
it
an
herbal
medicinal
quality
and
mild
tartness
that
lingers
slight
warmth
and
dryness
in
the
finish
slick
mouthfeel
full
bodied
with
very
low
carbonation
i
found
this
quite
easy
to
drink
which
surprised
me
a
bit
tasty
and
out
of
the
ordinary
thanks
go
out
to
wintermute
for
putting
this
in
my
shopping
basket
so
ive
heard
a
lot
about
this
style
most
notably
that
otter
creek
was
brewing
one
but
since
that
wasnt
available
i
decided
ide
get
the
real
thing
with
this
one
cool
looking
red
label
with
a
helmet
on
the
front
pours
a
nice
pumpkin
orange
color
with
absolutely
no
head
at
all
smell
was
very
interesting
almost
mead
like
with
honey
floral
characters
sweet
candy
sugar
and
alcohol
taste
was
a
bit
duller
with
some
lemon
and
almost
an
english
ale
like
characteristic
also
mouthfeel
was
sort
of
flat
and
clunky
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
have
balanced
things
out
somewhat
i
think
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
but
i
cant
promise
that
ill
be
picking
it
up
again
maybe
the
otter
creek
offering
sampling
this
beer
was
an
interesting
and
unique
experience
but
at
5
a
bottle
i
do
not
think
i
would
try
it
again
im
glad
that
i
gave
kataja
olut
a
chance
even
if
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
it
again
i
like
exotic
and
different
as
much
as
the
next
ba
but
a
beerlike
beverage
has
to
be
good
in
order
to
warrant
a
repeat
purchase
interesting
only
works
the
first
time
around
notes
i
went
into
this
not
knowing
what
to
expect
but
it
turns
out
i
like
sahti
at
least
this
one
i
found
it
to
be
quite
pleasant
even
without
much
carbonation
the
aromas
and
flavors
blended
nicely
and
the
alcohol
content
was
nice
and
warming
on
a
cool
fall
day
i
hope
to
run
into
this
again
some
day
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
shortlasting
fizzy
head
herbal
and
spice
medicinal
aroma
medium
cherryish
sticky
medicine
herbal
like
little
carbonation
mildly
tarty
and
sweetish
residue
aftertaste
dry
warm
warming
in
a
word
cough
medicine
a
pint
is
too
much
drinkability
reading
through
the
reviews
here
i
am
struck
by
the
variety
of
descriptions
i
didnt
get
much
of
the
lambic
or
geuze
flavors
at
all
and
i
suspect
that
may
be
because
my
beer
was
a
fresher
sample
somebody
noted
that
sahtis
can
turn
quickly
and
when
they
do
they
become
sour
than
others
have
tasted
its
far
from
my
favorite
style
but
i
did
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
taste
this
ancient
brew
first
sahti
ive
ever
tried
maybe
the
last
got
this
at
ebenezers
in
lovell
me
as
part
of
my
ongoing
beer
education
it
was
an
amber
color
with
virtually
no
head
it
smelled
like
malty
gin
taste
was
sweet
fruit
juniper
berries
a
little
malt
not
terribly
exciting
i
didnt
want
to
try
another
and
i
pretty
much
always
want
a
second
serving
of
a
new
to
me
beer
poured
a
light
copperamber
with
no
head
to
speak
of
looked
flat
to
methe
aromas
on
the
other
hand
have
plenty
of
life
very
juicy
and
fruity
with
orange
really
sticking
out
with
some
wet
grain
underneath
flat
feeling
in
the
mouth
just
not
impressed
in
any
way
therequite
sweet
the
flat
feel
just
makes
it
unineresting
to
even
finish
there
is
a
little
fruitiness
to
it
but
nothing
can
save
it
for
meill
stay
away
from
this
in
the
future
straight
up
pour
has
a
bubbly
white
head
that
vanishes
immediately
leaving
no
lace
murky
brown
amber
color
no
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
tart
apple
cider
nose
starts
and
finishes
as
sour
apple
cider
no
noticeable
hops
or
malt
if
this
is
what
juniper
does
to
beer
i
can
skip
it
waaay
overpriced
at
4
95
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
liquid
solutions
tigard
or
mighty
interesting
and
not
unpleasant
but
not
one

would
come

for

interestingquite
barleywineold
ale
like
last
swigs
first
sahti
i
ever
tried
interesting
worth
a
try
to
chalk
up
another
style
like
a
watered
down
root
beer
drinkability
the
unique
taste
of
the
juniper
limits
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
despite
that
i
like
it
if
only
for
the
uniqueness
of
the
beer
hazed
copper
no
head
at
all
i
guess
thats
normal
for
the
style
sparse
bubbles
sitting
at
the
bottom
bready
malt
aroma
kinda
like
rye
bread
hints
of
paper
bag
and
juniper
think
gin
almost
like
a
stale
english
beer
estery
pearlike
booze
comes
through
as
it
nears
room
temperature
the
flavor
starts
sweet
caramelly
and
very
doughy
with
a
distinct
sugariness
hints
of
sweetened
english
tea
cider
earth
and
sweet
potato
pear
and
banana
really
come
through
with
warmth
highly
unusual
rye
bread
and
paper
bag
rides
out
sweet
and
earthy
caramelly
the
juniper
fairly
mild
very
minimal
carbonation
nearly
still
medium
body
finishes
fairly
dry
without
a
trace
of
alcohol
based
on
flavor
i
would
have
guessed
this
to
be
in
the
34
range
interesting
but
i
dont
think
this
will
ever
be
my
favorite
style
kinda
reminds
me
of
very
old
english
beer
thats
been
sitting
on
a
warm
shelf
for
years
very
much
an
antique
rural
experience
this
beer
was
very
interesting
although
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
in
this
case
i
would
drink
it
again
or
if
i
come
across
a
different
brand
to
see
if
there
is
any
noticeable
difference
in
flavor
ps
she
brewed
a
version
with
birch
bark
that
she
didnt
ferment
and
it
seemed
to
take
care
of
my
allergies
wild
drinkability
not
bad
as
this
is
a
very
different
style
and
you
need
to
look
at
it
from
the
definition
of
what
a
sahti
is
i
need
to
try
some
others
if
i
can
find
any
to
compare
to
this
an
exceptionally
unique
creation
here
pours
out
to
a
hazy
tea
orange
color
with
no
head
no
carbonation
whatsoever
different
aromas
are
of
slight
orange
peel
rye
bread
and
tea
leaves
goes
rather
well
together
at
this
point
i
became
genuinely
interested
taste
is
quite
different
than
i
expected
as
when
i
read
juniper
bush
on
the
label
i
nearly
cringed
smooth
flavors
of
orange
dry
malts
subtle
sweetness
mixed
with
sour
and
tea
notes
interesting
mouthfeel
was
bland
and
smooth
but
not
watery
had
an
almost
light
oil
feel
to
it
if
you
will
drinkability
is
ok
i
could
go
for
one
of
these
every
once
in
a
while
it
had
this
thick
viscusy
body
with
and
orange
hue
with
a
sweet
aroma
bit
phenol
and
funk
tones
to
it
i
though
some
beer
elf
had
switched
the
label
on
me
could
of
sworn
it
was
a
zatte
from
tji
in
holland
but
there
was
this
freaking
wierd
funk
to
it
i
guess
thats
what
juniper
tastes
like
either
way
i
was
stoked
to
cross
that
beer
of
my
styles
drunken
no
pup
intended
list
if
you
see
try
it
but
be
where
of
the
beer
demons
very
interesting
to
say
the
least
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
although
one
of
the
rarest
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
slim
opportunity
to
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
even
though
it
isnt
the
best
i
would
love
to
have
a
fresh
pint
on
this
on
tap
in
its
motherland
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
there
wasnt
anything
i
really
enjoyed
about
this
beer
11
2
ounce
bottle
thanks
mabz
since
sahti
is
a
live
product
it
will
change
quickly
fresh
examples
are
sweet
and
not
tart
at
all
but
bottles
that
have
been
around
for
a
while
can
become
quite
sour
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
odd
while
it
isnt
entirely
flat
its
much
more
lightly
carbonated
than
im
used
to
and
it
somehow
manages
to
coat
the
tongue
hmmm
who
would
have
thought
about
body
from
such
a
clear
beer
and
while
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
price
is
too
prohibitive
to
make
this
a
habit
5
clams
for
the
bottle
ouch
well
pretty
boring
to
me
i
have
no
interest
in
ever
drinking
this
again
it
tastes
like
an
english
ipa
without
the
hops
hard
to
finish
no
redeeming
qualities
a
complete
waste
of
4
49
drinkability
definitely
not
worth
the
money
i
spent
on
the
bottle
around
5
if
i
remember
right
the
beer
was
ok
overall
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
againl
poured
into
a
tumbler
no
head
cloudy
brown
smell
was
weak
i
was
expecting
a
little
juniper
hit
in
the
nose
but
nothing
was
present
taste
was
pleasingly
sweet
but
with
the
lack
of
any
juniper
bite
its
as
if
they
brewed
this
for
export
thinking
that
nonfinns
wouldnt
be
able
to
handle
anything
overthetop
or
complex
damn
marketing
firm
mouthfeel
was
dominated
by
the
sweetness
with
some
surprising
carbonation
because
bubbles
were
tough
to
spot
of
course
if
you
like
somewhat
sweet
beers
this
is
an
easy
to
imbibe
fell
way
short
of
expectations
and
certainly
not
worth
the
premium
price
that
i
paid
for
it
had
to
order
a
draft
goudenband
to
recover
my
taste
buds
did
not
happen
what
i
did
get
was
a
sour
tasting
somewhat
malty
brew
with
little
carbonation
and
no
real
head
to
speak
of
was
it
awful
no
was
it
a
unique
taste
experience
hardly
too
bland
and
characterless
i
would
have
preferred
a
lambic
or
gueze
to
this
one
again
not
bad
but
nothing
worth
seking
out
this
was
a
different
and
interesting
brew
i
find
it
curious
that
my
sample
bottle
was
characterized
by
such
a
big
carbonation
when
other
reviewers
longed
for
such
i
was
pleased
with
this
refreshing
selection
this
fragile
brew
has
a
short
shelf
life
so
be
sure
to
get
it
as
fresh
as
possible
11
2
oz
bottle
obtained
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
in
feb
2005
and
consumed
a
couple
evenings
later
no
freshness
date
which
is
a
concern
because
sahti
is
suppose
to
be
served
fresh
well
thats
what
the
ba
article
says
hard
poured
to
get
almost
a
thin
layer
of
white
head
over
a
cloudy
apple
cider
colored
liquid
smells
piney
with
mild
cherry
sour
raspberry
and
rhubarb
tastes
sour
with
notable
piney
flavors
at
first
fruity
flavors
appear
momentarily
including
apples
like
hard
cider
raspberry
and
strawberries
its
quite
dry
which
makes
it
a
bit
difficult
for
me
to
pick
out
additional
fruits
although
there
clearly
are
more
than
i
listed
above
the
end
during
the
swallow
has
a
chalky
kind
of
bark
flavor
that
persists
well
into
the
aftertaste
which
also
includes
tart
grapefruit
this
is
sour
but
not
as
sour
at
the
lammin
sahti
i
had
a
couple
nights
ago
it
also
doesnt
have
as
much
depth
in
scent
and
flavor
carbonation
is
very
mild
and
with
its
counterpart
it
does
share
a
late
burst
of
of
fine
bubbles
that
form
on
the
flat
of
my
tongue
and
tear
it
apart
with
an
acrid
ummph
overall
it
leaves
me
with
an
impression
of
a
dry
and
barky
hard
cider
medium
mouthfeel
fairly
drinkable
i
could
certainly
handle
another
which
i
couldnt
of
the
lammin
sahti
the
other
night
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
bevereage
one
evening
in
preparation
for
the
lammin
sahti
the
next
evening
this
was
a
challenging
beverage
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
and
would
eagerly
have
another
in
the
future
i
am
now
a
sahti
fan
drinkability
notes
weird

i
sort
of
like
the
flavor
it
has
grown
on
me
after
several
sips
if
the
carbonation
had
a
nice
sharp
spike
of
crispness
to
it
id
probably
love
it
subjectively
it
is
certainly
interesting
but
objectively
nearly
impossible
to
score
due
to
lack
of
experience
o
some
interesting
flavours
but
it
could
be
described
as
tasting
like
a
cheap
version
of
a
jw
lees
barley
wine
and
if
it
were
to
be
judged
as
barley
wine
it
would
fare
very
badly
not
bad
but
not
something
id
have
again
especially
for
8
stinking
euros
oreally
unique
beer
the
juniper
is
very
subtle
it
tastes
really
fruity
and
the
banana
flavor
is
really
at
the
forefront
could
use
more
juniper
for
balance
overall
really
surprised
how
sweet
this
was
i
didnt
expect
sahti
to
be
sweet
quite
liked
it
nice
to
try
finally
a
sahti
o
very
interesting
complex
but
still
stale
this
is
probably
a
style
that
you
love
or
hate
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
sample
a
sahti
this
one
would
be
a
nice
choice
od
tough
call
for
sure
i
like
this
beer
a
bit
but
it
would
have
to
grow
on
me
very
different
interesting
and
complex
but
hard
to
finish
aromatic
as
hell
and
something
like
ive
never
had
before
but
that
doesnt
make
it
good
recommend
it
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
genuine
finnish
sahti
