overall
since
this
beer
is
now
retired
it
can
be
hard
to
find
im
going
to
source
another
23
4packs
and
enjoy
this
one
for
years
to
come
i
love
the
dubbel
style
and
this
is
a
fantastic
example
from
a
world
class
brewery
this
beer
screams
cellar
me
i
have
not
tried
a
fresh
example
but
the
cellared
ones
are
worth
every
penny
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
i
have
a
hard
time
giving
perfect
scores
so
i
toned
the
scored
back
a
lot
but
im
going
to
see
if
i
can
track
down
another
one
of
these
i
doubt
there
are
too
many
around
which
is
a
shame
cloudy
caramel
pour
with
a
light
creamy
head
that
lingers
as
a
khaki
ring
around
the
glass
the
nose
really
sings
of
yeast
malt
and
sour
punch
straws
sorry
i
couldnt
resist
but
it
is
true
loved
those
things
candied
fruit
is
at
the
front
of
the
flavor
profile
as
well
with
a
warm
smooth
boozy
finish
goose
island
brings
it
again
for
me
strong
and
interesting
brew
malty
overtones
would
make
an
excellent
dessert
beer
carmel
in
color
sweet
on
the
nose
with
a
warm
maltiness
the
flavour
is
rich
malty
and
sweet
this
has
become
a
favorite
at
least
the
2012
bottle
from
july
2012
poured
into
tulip
glasses
and
shared
beautiful
clear
chestnut
brown
color
with
half
finger
of
slightly
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
nice
dried
fruit
and
belgian
candy
aroma
taste
is
delicious
and
perfect
to
the
style
raisins
currants
dried
apricot
candy
and
a
slight
sharp
bitterness
to
offset
the
sweet
mouth
feel
was
dryer
than
i
expected
making
the
beer
seem
thin
for
style
but
actually
probably
makes
it
more
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
belgian
dubbel
albeit
a
bit
pricey
in
this
case
9
50
for
22
oz
caramelized
malt
and
maple
sugar
great
roundness
and
no
trace
of
alcohol
long
sweet
bitterness
and
hint
of
hops
very
nice
delicious
creamy
honey
caramel
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
and
smooth
and
overall
aged
wellm
abbeys
arent
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoy
one
every
now
and
then
i
prefer
a
tripel
or
a
saison
im
aging
a
couple
of
2013s
though
to
see
how
they
develop
o
great
dessert
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fans
of
belgians
so
i
had
been
sitting
on
this
bottle
for
awhile
i
cracked
it
open
when
my
brother
in
laws
came
over
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
was
sweet
smooth
beer
that
i
can
only
imagine
aging
helped
make
more
subtle
the
yeasty
flavor
was
there
but
it
was
in
the
background
and
also
subtle
overall
a
nice
beer
overall
pours
cloudy
brown
with
a
medium
beige
head
aroma
and
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
yeast
and
some
sweet
dark
fruit
notes
with
light
bitterness
palate
is
a
medium
body
mild
carbonation
with
a
sweet
yeast
and
light
sticky
mouth
feel
sweet
caramel
malt
yeast
with
light
bitterness
on
the
end
a
smooth
flavorful
and
tasty
brew
poured
from
76ml
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
beautiful
mahogany
color
like
nothing
ive
seen
before
with
a
tan
2
finger
head
and
modest
lacing
one
of
the
best
pours
ive
had
yet
aroma
is
exceptional
as
well
at
first
you
can
smell
the
8
alcohol
but
then
it
opens
up
to
some
fruitiness
notably
raisins
or
bubble
gum
and
then
a
slight
matly
smell
to
finish
taste
is
not
as
great
as
the
aroma
still
pleasant
though
first
upon
entering
my
mouth
like
the
aroma
first
taste
was
the
alcohol
content
but
as
it
sits
in
your
mouth
the
fruitiness
comes
to
life
and
the
after
taste
is
that
of
smoky
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
which
is
deceptive
as
it
looks
like
a
very
thin
bodied
beer
overall
a
good
beer
could
be
one
of
the
best
ive
had
if
the
flavor
was
a
bit
better
id
have
it
time
and
time
again
though
for
sure

poured
into

a
deep
amber
touching
on

one
finger
white
head
with
good
lacing
oak
banana
and
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
aroma
yeast
presence
is
strong
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
akin
to
mellon
going
on
fairly
viscous
with
a
nice
bitter
after
bite
this
is
the
2012
batch
for
this
brew
right
on
target
for
a
belgian
ale
taste
color
and
aroma
are
all
reminiscent
of
a
real
belgian
abbey
ale
nice
job
and
well
done
delicious
o
a
wellcrafted
beer
full
of
sweet
flavors
but
i
had
hoped
for
something
a
bit
more
i
guess
i
was
just
left
wanting
more
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
pay
as
much
as
i
did
for
it
great
beer
delicious
complex
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
repeatable
and
worthy
of
stocking
in
your
beer
fridge
now
owned
by
a
international
big
brother
beer
conglomerate
picked
up
a
12
ounce
bottle
from
the
local
bottle
shop
took
a
try
on
a
2013
thought
it
could
handle
the
age
well
not
expecting
be
knocked
out
but
wanting
to
give
another
goose
island
a
try
poured
into
my
tulip
glass
nothing
tremendous
on
appearance
unfiltered
thats
ok
12
finger
of

was
gone
quickly
interesting
mahogany
hue
the
aroma
was
awesome
raisins
and
dark
fruit
apples
or
pears
molasses
and
of
course
belgium
aside
from
the
presence
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
all
of
the
aromas
were
strong
in
the
flavor
profile
not
a
ton
of
the
funk
and
overall
a
great
flavor
balance
velvety
mouthfeel
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
i
have
tried
for
mouthfeel
overall
this
was
excellent
great
balance
to
this
beer
and
a
pleasant
surprise
as
a
big
ipa
and
stout
guy
before
long
i
might
be
drawn
to
more
of
the
belgian
styles
pick
one
up
really
enjoyed
this
one
would
have
it
again

sure

enjoyable
offering
2012
edition
overall
this
was
a
solid
but
not
spectacular
beer
but
one
of
the
better
goose
island
beers
i
have
had
the
quality
of
these
beers
continues
to
impress
me
and
it
is
a
brand
i
am
happy
to
support
goose
island
im
delighted
that
bud
hasnt
killed
your
goodness
remarks
very
tasty
overall
good
ester
character
but
the
malt
is
a
bit
too
sweet
alcohol
is
more
overwhelming
than
i
would
like
this
a
fairly
basic
interpretation
of
a
belgian
dubbel
nothing
overwhelms
yet
nothing
disappoints
d
this
was
a
nice
bsda
with
enjoyable
scent
and
taste
and
decent
body
the
finish
was
smooth
although
it
was
a
bit
hot
so
it
was
easier
to
sip
nothing
amazing
about
this
beer
but
a
fairly
solid
brew
age
would
likely
really
help
it
has
a
reddishbrown
iced
tea
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
settles
quickly
sweet
clean
malts
show
up
on
the
nose
with
some
green
apple
skin
toast
and
some
low
peppery
notes
it
has
a
sweet
maltforward
flavor
with
raisins
figs
fresh
bread
slight
yeast
and
slight
clove
spiciness
it
has
no
bitterness
but
is
not
overly
sweet
either
goes
down
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
the
nicest
dubbel
brewed
in
the
u
s
that
ive
had
yet
the
two
to
three
year
mark
seems
to
be
the
magic
time
for
this
beer
each
progressively
older
beer
drank
smoother
than
its
predecessor
i
wish
i
would
have
had
a
2009
to
delve
further
into
my
findings
but
i
am
happy
that
i
got
to
taste
a
progression
of
a
beer
through
three
years
of
aging
i
based
my
rating
on
the
2011
since
it
was
the
median
overall
a
magnificent
beer
from
gi
and
one
that
really
showcases
their
brewing
skill
would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
dubbels
or
doppelbock
beers
a
pretty
tasty
and
great
ale
that
goes
down
smooth
and
is
enjoyable
not
especially
belgian
feeling
though
that
gripe
aside
worth
trying
final
grade
4

a
very
solid
a
goose
islands
p√®re
jacques
is
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
in
my
8
years
on
this
site
its
not
perfect
but
its
still
a
very
highquality
beer
that
manages
to
justify
its
hefty
price
point
at
least
in
this
province
where
it
is
priced
about
the
same
as
a
bottle
of
midtier
wine
all
belgian
ale
aficionados
should
consider
this
one
worth
at
least
one
purchase
as
it
makes
for
an
excellent
warmer
for
the
fallwinter
months
strongly
considering
picking
up
another
bottle
for
cellaring
purposes
upon
warming
a
bit
each
sip
tasted
a
little
different
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
coming
more
to
the
forefront
a
very
elegant
sipper
that
aged
quite
gracefully
a
worththewait
little
treat
o
as
an
abbey
ale
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
is
flavorful
and
rich
and
it
is
among
the
best
examples
of
an
american
take
on
a
dubbel
i
have
tried
so
far
i
would
and
do
recommend
this
beer
to
others
and
i
will
seek
it
out
again
overall
impression
very
good
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
point
i
would
purchase
again
abbey
ale
style
sure
ill
try
it
out
poured
into
a
glass
chamay
goblet
and
wow
it
looks
fantastic
rich
amberbrown
hue
although
not
a
lot
of
head
with
minimal
lacing
smells
aromatic
enough
to
pass
for
a
belgian
taste
is
pretty
well
in
line
as
well
really
good
attempt
and
one
that
wouldnt
mind
having
again
definitely
a
reccomendation
cheers
excellent
looking
beer
not
clear
looks
rich
and
tasty
not
a
lot
of
head
or
lacing
excellent
smell
sweet
and
rich
taste
not
quite
as
good
as
it
smells
very
good
but
not
excellent
overall
it
is
an
outstanding
beer
but
not
excellent
and
for
the
cost
there
are
to
many
that
i
prefer
more
overall
not
bad
a
good
dubbel
but
nothing
special
about
it
if
you
could
buy
this
or
westmalle
for
example
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
why
you
would
ever
choose
this
one
this
not
an
easy
ale
to
make
and
maintain
the
flavors
presented
here
nice
work
complements
again
to
the
brewmaster
o
good
dubbel
complex
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
and
probably
easy
to
obtain
now
worth
a
try
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
very
rooty
and
toasty
malts
deep
and
dark
carbonation
was
on
point
this
was
a
small
cup
from
a
bottle
at
a
tasting
sweet
malts
give
way
to
a
relativly
dry
peppered
hops
hits
you
way
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
almost
a
sour
bitter
finish
the
beer
leans
to
the
toasted
peppery
side
of
things
and
dries
out
a
little
bit
but
there
is
still
complexity
with
in
that
area
that
it
resides
i
really
love
the
hop
profile
goose
island
has
its
subtle
and
large
at
the
same
time
not
over
done
and
thats
always
welcomed
o
drinking
it
is
a
delight
but
id
be
just
as
happy
sniffing
it
all
night
i
wasnt
expecting
this
nuanced
and
complex
of
a
beer
i
love
it
but
not
quite
my
favorite
still
recommended
reinforced
my
faith
in
goose
island
o
overall
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
liked
this
one
very
well
done
o
one
of
the
best
from
goose
island
at
least
its
one
of
the
best
that
they
distribute
to
ca
o
dark
belgian
spices
and
some
cola
pere
jacques
pours
a
hazy
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
dry
fruit
aroma
with
hints
of
belgian
candies
the
taste
has
a
nice
sharp
malty
backbone
with
good
hints
of
candy
flavors
and
strong
dry
fruit
flavors
good
strong
flavors
strong
body
nice
feel
overall
its
a
nice
bold
dubbel
thats
very
full
and
a
nice
warm
aftertaste

d
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
with
a
standout
and
diverse
set
of
aromas
but
not
necessarily
a
dubbel
i
would
seek
out
again
o
an
uneven
beer
in
many
ways
but
not
without
its
merits
drinkable
a
nice
example
of
the
style
offering
good
examples
of
traditional
style
character
i
love
this
beer
really
love
this
beer
overall
a
slightly
subdued
dubbel
flavors
are
a
great
blend
and
aroma
is
interesting
as
well
will
come
back
to
this
brew
again
aroma
put
me
off
a
bit
at
first
but
it
is
really
a
nice
brew
after
that
well
worth
trying
a
great
example
i
think
the
body
was
the
typical
lightmedium
of
the
style
and
the
finish
was
clean
and
semidry
drinkability
was
very
good
i
would
happily
drink
a
few
more
of
these
overall
a
very
nice
brew
certainly
worth
your
time
if
you
see
it
prost
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
that
says
2012
vintage
into
a
tulip
pours
copper
red
very
cloudy
with
a
tiny
white
head
smells
of
berries
and
apples
very
nice
tastes
of
raisins
and
berries
nice
combination
beer
is
carbonated
really
nicely
medium
body
goes
down
nicely
overall
a
very
good
beer
odubbels
have
become
my
favorate
type
of
beer
great
color
smell
taste
and
feel
devolops
in
the
bottle
for
5
years
i
will
wait
a
year
and
try
another
it
was
great
overall
this
beer
was
enjoyable
and
though
probably
better
fresh
ive
had
it
fresh
too
it
was
very
good
aged
and
mellowed
poured
a
brownish
body
with
auburn
tint
with
decent
headlace
on
top
aroma
is
yeasty
sweet
like
caramel
figs
toffee
dark
fruit
not
much
hop
bite
or
citric
orange
one
might
expect
smooth
sweet
a
fuller
body
that
is
slightly
chewey
i
get
some
some
sweet
malts
liek
carameltoffee
and
dark
fruits
like
figs
maybe
raisins
and
a
touch
of
citricorange
although
i
find
the
beers
sweetness
overpowers
any
fruit
flavor
complexity
finishes
crisp
with
a
bite
and
is
a
strong
hearty
beer
that
is
enjoyable
serving
type
bottle
2013
run
o
very
nice
one
ill
be
drinking
again
on
tap
so
far
my
favorite
of
the
goose
island
higher
end
beers
pepe
nero
is
next
o
interesting
beer
had
a
lot
more
alcohol
presence
than
some
higher
beers
that
ive
had
gonna
pick
some
more
up
and
let
it
celler
for
awhile
and
see
if
it
balances
out
has
a
good
flavor
but
the
alcohol
kinda
of
overpowers
it
for
me
at
the
moment
think
it
has
potential
still
oa
pretty
good
dubbel
not
as
complex
as
most
but
the
flavors
are
very
robust
o
enjoyable
beer
for
the
style
this
is
probably
best
suited
to
go
with
food
or
as
an
after
dinner
drink
like
union
jack
did
for
me
with
ipas
pere
jacques
has
done
for
belgian
ale
im
now
a
big
fan
o
very
nice
offering
flavors
mix
very
nicely
together
o
nothing
stands
out
as
a
key
feature
it
is
a
very
nice
looking
beer
but
is
lacking
in
complexity
and
balance
though
with
minor
adjustments
can
be
a
solid
abbey
will
age
a
bottle
and
see
if
it
lends
itself
better
with
time
overall
i
enjoyed
this
slightly
strange
tasting
for
a
belgian
dubbel
but
a
unique
exerience
a
pretty
nice
dubbel
i
tend
to
lean
towards
quads
but
this
had
some
nice
dark
sweetness
to
it
worth
a
go
if
its
available
but
nothing
id
recommend
hunting
o
a
little
too
hot
with
the
alcohol
which
is
not
as
well
hidden
as
other
examples
in
the
dubbel
style
slightly
too
boozy
for
my
personal
preference
this
beer
needs
to
be
slowly
sipped
to
be
enjoyed
overall
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
and
the
price
is
awesome
as
well
i
paid
9
50
for
a
1
pint
9
87
oz
bottle
overall
decent
but
not
outstanding
id
buy
an
ommegang
before
getting
this
again
a
little
too
tart
for
me
o
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
brew
but
i
honestly
dont
remember
this
beer
being
this
damn
good
this
vintage
is
drinking
beautifully
right
now
and
definitely
plan
on
aging
a
few
more
of
these
pretty
good
not
quite
on
par
with
say
ommegangs
abbey
ale
but
this
is
well
worth
a
try
o
interesting
one
here
very
barleywine
esque
with
less
hops
lots
of
strong
dark
fruit
and
grape
must
notes
o
too
sweet
to
finish
tastes
more
like
an
imperial
amber
than
a
dubbel
theres
probably
an
audience
for
this
beer
but
im
not
a
member
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
nothing
which
really
stands
out
here
there
are
better
dubbels
than
this
overall
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
barleywine
taste
wise
it
has
a
nice
well
balanced
flavour
and
is
very
drinkable
maybe
just
a
touch
too
sweet
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
id
buy
a
few
more
of
these
to
see
how
they
age
o
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
a
hit
for
goose
island
id
definitely
recommend
it
to
a
friend
and
would
love
to
have
another
o
very
good
and
to
style
quite
drinkable
and
well
crafted
i
havent
delved
deeply
into
the
style
but
this
was
a
very
nice
introduction
o
very
drinkable
good
chicago
dubbel
overall
a
reasonably
good
beer
very
sweet
and
malty
o
another
excellent
brew
by
goose
island
o
i
wasnt
superbly
impressed
by
this
but
it
is
fairly
fresh
and
i
can
feel
the
potential
im
interested
in
popping
the
next
one
open
down
the
road
eventually
ill
rereview
kickass
dubbel
from
a
kickass
brewery
pere
jacques
is
very
much
recommendable
overall
i
enjoyed
pere
jacques
perhaps
a
higher
score
would
have
been
warranted
if
the
nose
was
brighter
but
i
am
not
really
complaining
i
can
see
how
the
syrupy
sweetness
may
become
overbearing
with
a
second
bomber
but
overall
i
thought
it
was
tasty
had
it
out
of
a
bottle
didnt
pour
it
out
so
dont
know
what
appearance
it
has
but
i
significantly
enjoyed
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
i
ever
had
its
a
very
smoothjuicy
tasting
beer
i
cant
believe
its
8
alcohol
that
could
be
dangerous
because
they
go
down
easy
would
highly
reccomend
spending
the
extra
dollars
for
it
because
its
worth
it
was
always
wanting
to
try
it
and
know
i
have
leaves
a
good
finish
it
your
mouth
o
i
rarely
drink
dubbels
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
very
complex
with
loads
of
fruit
and
a
nice
grainy
bread
background
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
nice
example
of
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
overall
this
beer
just
doesnt
suit
me
there
are
several
ways
to
go
about
a
dubbel
and
while
this
seems
a
wellcrafted
beer
it
mostly
hits
each
of
my
least
favorite
elements
of
the
style
overall
i
think
this
is
flat
and
that
has
impacted
the
whole
beer
in
a
negative
way
so
i
will
revisit
with
another
one
and
update
my
review
do
not
hesitate
to
enjoy
an
aged
bottle
of
pere
jacques
it
certainly
improves
in
my
opinion
o
a
solid
dubbel
that
makes
great
use
of
the
malts
yeast
and
alcohol
to
make
a
nicely
simple
yet
complex
beer
not
as
complex
as
a
few
belgians
but
still
nice
dangerously
drinkable
as
well
worth
a
drink
o
this
beers
was
continually
evolving
as
it
warmed
up
and
the
more
complex
flavors
came
into
play
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
at
first
to
me
but
then
it
got
a
bit
cleaner
in
the
finish
as
it
warmed
and
settled
a
nice
dubbel
from
goose
island
and
very
good
fresh
and
i
expect
will
age
well
too
i
would
drink
this
one
again
if
i
find
another
one
i
might
age
it
for
a
year
or
so
in
anticipation
of
even
more
flavor
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
the
8
abv
is
well
and
the
drinkability
is
also
pretty
good
if
i
come
across
another
2010
version
of
this
ill
probably
buy
it
again
i
recommend
it
to
those
who
like
a
good
3
00
a
bottle
dubbel
o
fruity
and
slightly
sour
quite
delicious
o
a
little
sweet
but
definitely
fits
the
style
im
really
enjoying
this
brew
sweetness
makes
is
a
good
beer
to
take
your
time
with
and
savor
great
looking
beer
that
smells
even
better
a
definite
must
try
if
curious
about
dubbels
im
curious
to
see
how
it
will
age
as
this
was
a
fairly
young
beer
again
good
job
goose
island
m
medium
bodied
wow
what
a
great
beer
poured
a
very
hazy
amber
with
a
nice
3finger
head
head
stays
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
smells
very
fruity
not
too
much
though
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
malts
to
make
it
a
wonderful
sniffer
very
sweet
tasting
at
first
nice
and
malty
with
hints
of
grape
and
raisens
on
the
finish
it
smoothes
out
and
the
alcohol
really
shines
through
nice
bubblegum
taste
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
hops
abound
the
aftertaste
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
high
alcohol
content
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
need
to
try
a
fresher
one
again
now
to
see
the
difference
not
the
most
amazing
dubbel
from
the
us
but
a
contender
o
just
a
hair
above
average
a
fine
beer
but
doesnt
resonate
particularly
well
with
my
palate
22
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
073011
served
in
a
goblet
the
beer
pours
a
reddishorange
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
didnt
stay
around
for
very
long
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
bready
malt
and
some
caramel
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
nuts
and
toffee
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
syrupy
and
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
not
a
bad
brew
overall
id
buy
this
one
again

a
bomber
o
i
had
this
beer
a
week
ago
on
tap
when
i
was
thirsty
and
it
knocked
my
socks
off
the
bottle
is
a
little
less
impressive
but
still
a
straight
down
the
middle
representation
of
a
good
dubbel
as
with
most
bigger
belgians
this
beer
finds
its
sweet
spot
pun
intended
as
it
warms
a
little
in
the
glass
i
just
wish
i
could
drink
it
slow
enough
to
get
there
o
i
think
its
a
good
balanced
beer
not
really
getting
any
hops
but
i
wasnt
expecting
that
mostly
malt
but
its
balanced
out
with
the
dark
fruit
tastes
a
little
lighter
than
it
looks
o
a
pretty
good
brew
deffiantly
better
then
my
initial
reaction
to
it
overall
a
solid
dubbel
taste
is
lightly
sweet
berries
iron
whole
wheat
bread
hint
caramelised
whitebread
crust
like
nut
tree
white
bread
a
personal
reference
probably
meaningless
to
most
it
is
smooth
and
flavourful
wellrounded
engagin
highly
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
excellent
o
for
a
8
7
dubbel
this
brew
drinks
really
easy
and
could
get
dangerous
with
not
a
trace
of
alcohol
on
it
a
rather
nice
refreshing
unique
dubbel
that
comes
in
unusually
dry
a
must
try
for
a
fan
of
the
style
because
its
unlike
any
that
i
have
had
so
far
cheers
o
an
interesting
brew
from
the
first
of
a
trilogy
of
the
aged
belgium
style
ales
purchased
yesterday
very
nice
medium
bodied
beer
easy
to
drink
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
a
descent
drink
but
no
their
best
overall
a
quite
decent
and
rather
easy
drinking
dubbel
give
it
a
go
if
you
have
the
chance
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
scent
is
mostly
that
of
toasted
malts
with
some
sweet
nutty
tones
the
taste
is
rather
bold
and
complex
the
yeast
and
malts
create
a
unique
toasted
flavor
that
is
caramelized
and
dry
with
a
touch
of
sugary
sweetness
with
a
lot
of
flavor
to
the
taste
this
makes
for
a
good
sipping
beer
d
nice
i
like
this
one
a
lot
one
of
goose
islands
best
bomber
from
lets

a
beautiful

4
odnot
my
favorite
style
i
am
very
inexperienced
with
the
style
too
this
one
doesnt
have
anything
that
jumps
out
to
me
bland
the
beginnings
of
a
nice
beer
definitely
need
to
mature
in
the
bottle
going
to
put
the
rest
in
the
cellar
and
break
open
next
year
o
pretty
tasty
dubbel
this
is
a
super
complex
belgian
brew
thats
pretty
drinkable
and
tasty
overall
a
decent
balance
where
i
feel
others
lack
in
this
category
recommendable
overall
i
really
like
the
strong
yet
soft
presentation
its
hard
to
compare
it
to
belgium
counterparts
since
its
not
as
complex
but
it
was
an
overall
enjoyable
drinking
experience
whatever
this
was
a
letdown
not
the
best
domestic
dubbel
certainly
not
bad
but
not
praiseworthy
o
so
you
want
to
produce
a
belgian
well
tough
category
with
of
ocourse
real
belgians
to
compete
with
pere
is
a
good
beer
i
would
have
liked
more
carbonation
as
i
found
this
beer
too
flat
ill
try
it
again
and
revisit
my
review
o
enjoyable
but
could
be
a
lot
more
with
more
flavors
and
mouthfeel
would
have
again
a
very
pleasant
surprise
for
a
boring
night
without
internet
or
tv
very
tasty
very
sweet
this
is
really
nice
i
find
it
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
other
than
that
is
true
to
the
style
i
would
recommend
this
beer
it
shows
some
nice
complexity
and
while
not
as
refined
as
some
belgium
dubbels
it
is
worth
trying
out
o
not
all
that
impressive
id
take
one
if
offered
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
in
the
future
dvery
tasty
beer
lots
of
dark
fruity
sweetness
hints
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
big
sweet
malts
and
a
huge
syrupy
feel
this
is
an
interesting
dubbel
im
glad
i
finally
bought
a
bottle
i
think
im
going
to
have
to
buy
another
and
age
it
to
see
what
happens
o
the
high
complexity
makes
this
one
a
bit
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
few
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
gives
the
brew
just
a
pinch
of
warmth
throughout
i
would
be
happy
to
return
to
this
one
granted
it
is
not
one
i
would
enjoy
on
a
weekly
basis
ommegang
abbey
is
cheaper
and
better
this
tastes
like
that
but
with
20
water
the
aspects
of
a
great
dubbel
are
there
fig
stickiness
and
an
addictive
tanninlike
leathery
bluntness
it
just
lacks
punch
the
booze
is
there
but
i
dont
drink
dubbels
for
the
booze
o
a
decent
dubbel
for
somebody
looking
to
get
into
belgian
ales
nothing
over
the
top
good
but
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
overall
im
unimpressed
with
this
bottle
i
wouldnt
have
cellared
this
beer
had
i
noticed
it
was
a
screw
top
on
the
other
hand
i
can
tell
this
brew
should
be
great
ill
just
have
to
get
another
one
and
try
again
o
this
is
a
great
dubbel
i
think
its
on
par
with
many
of
the
belgian
ones
i
have
had
only
this
one
is
cheaper
and
more
accessible
than
any
rivals
o
3
5
a
very
nice
balanced
flavor
with
good
sweetness
refreshingly
clean
finish
with
just
a
bit
of
a
sticky
linger
a
good
allaround
dubbel
i
dont
remember
the
last
dubbel
i
had
it
was
probably
affligem
because
it
was
cheap
at
the
time
but
it
was
good
but
this
beer
was
sort
of
an
eye
opener
as
far
as
dubbels
go
aroma
took
me
completely
by
surprise
for
a
beer
i
bought
months
ago
and
pushed
to
the
back
of
the
cellar
the
taste
follows
through
very
nicely
from
the
aroma
and
its
quite
drinkable
basically
this
beer
reminds
me
that
i
need
to
expand
my
pallete
however
you
spell
it
and
try
some
more
dubbels
as
well
as
buy
some
more
of
this
to
age
overall
no
strong
aroma
or
finish
but
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
very
good
tasty
balanced
drinkable
cant
complain
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
ever
had
o
wondering
a
bit
about
the
storage
prior
to
my
obtaining
this
as
some
of
the
tastes
should
have
been
bolder
and
they
seem
faded
decent
effort
i
think
pours
a
murky
copper
color
similar
to
apple
cider
with
a
meager
tan
head
that
disappears
in
short
order
aroma
is
largely
of
caramel
with
some
alcohol
and
a
mild
fruitiness
the
caramel
malt
dominates
the
flavor
profile
though
the
considerable
alcohol
is
even
more
pronounced
than
in
the
nose
some
belgian
yeast
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
can
be
found
as
well
the
carbonation
could
be
a
little
higher
to
help
augment
the
sweetness
but
this
is
a
minor
grievance
dubbels
arent
exactly
my
favorite
style
but
as
far
as
dubbels
go
this
is
pretty
good
though
the
alcohol
could
be
concealed
a
little
better
goose
island
continues
to
demonstrate
a
skillful
hand
at
belgian

o
decent
dubbel
from
goose
island
reminds
me
of
an
old
ale
in
some
respects
particularly
because
of
the
heavy
malt
presence
and
vanilla
notes
still
this
is
a
tasty
brew
worthy
of
repeat
purchase
i
couldnt
believe
that
this
was
only
average
in
the
alcohol
department
as
i
could
feel
the
booze
well
before
i
finished
off
the
contents
this
servring
was
bottled
back
in
may
but
like
others
on
here
id
love
to
get
another
and
let
it
age
for
a
while
while
this
wasnt
cheap
it
was
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
and
id
certainly
give
this
another
go
in
due
time
o
the
combination
of
the
dark
fruit
yeast
and
light
mouthfeel
make
this
an
excellent
beer
and
very
approachable
o
a
very
good
domestic
dubbel
not
as
big
on
flavor
and
aroma
as
some
of
the
top
scoring
examples
but
priced
right
i
would
serve
this
without
hesitation
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
decent
sized
beige
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
brown
sugar
caramel
dark
cherries
raisins
and
prunes
with
a
nice
melanoidin
thing
going
on
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
quite
well
dark
sugars
and
fruits
with
burnt
raisin
thing
going
on
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
i
was
worried
that
i
had
sat
on
this
one
too
long
but
it
all
worked
out
nice
brew
that
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
aged
barleywine
or
a
dopplebock
maybe
now
i
should
try
a
fresh
one
an
excellent
example
of
a
dubbel
complex
elegant
sweet
and
chock
full
of
candycoated
dark
fruits
the
alcohol
is
deceptively
hidden
another
score
from
goose
island
on
par
with
st
bernardus
prior
8
i
was
hesitant
in
cracking
this
one
open
after
holding
onto
it
for
so
many
years
but
it
seems
to
have
aged
great
a
nice
year
round
offering
from
gi
i
usually
dont
like
this
style
and
thats
why
i
put
drinking
this
beer
off
for
so
long
but
this
is
one
of
the
few
rare
ones
that
really
works
for
me
glad
i
always
kept
thinking
about
it
more
win
for
the
goose
overall
a
pretty
solid
american
take
on
a
dubbel
could
of
been
a
little
more
yeasty
but
the
fruits
were
very
good
a
great
experience
from
my
first
goose
island
brew
one
that
foments
the
seeking
of
more
goodness
from
this
bunch
onice
dubbel
im
excited
to
see
goose
island
doing
some
more
elaborate
beers
deinitely
going
to
pick
up
another
bottle
to
age
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
very
little
amount
of
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
its
a
little
yeasty
too
and
really
quite
inviting
the
flavors
of
candi
sugar
and
fermented
dark
fruits
swarm
the
mouth
on
this
one
there
is
a
very
subtle
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
this
tastes
much
nicer
than
a
lot
of
dubbels
ive
have
in
the
past
the
mouthfeel
isnt
too
carbonated
its
a
heavierthick
beer
than
i
expected
too
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
really
quite
good
i
would
drink
it
again
i
enjoy
dubbels
a
great
deal
and
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
with
a
little
bit
of
tweaking
or
possibly
some
aging
this
would
really
be
sublime
pere
jacques
pours
a
deep
unpolished
mahogany
maybe
two
fingers
of
cream
colored
foam
crown
the
beer
but
head
retention
and
lacing
are
far
too
brief
and
clean
respectively
the
nose
is
fantastic
lots
of
plum
layered
with
other
dark
fruits
a
little
bit
of
pepper
and
clove
come
through
as
well
just
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
unfortunately
that
nose
doesnt
fully
translate
to
the
flavor
profile
as
the
estery
portion
of
the
beer
fades
rather
quickly
just
a
flash
of
sweet
plums
and
raisins
the
dominant
phenol
profile
is
a
bit
less
spicy
than
in
the
aromavery
little
pepper
and
just
a
lot
of
clove
the
body
is
suitably
light
but
the
carbonation
falls
dull
on
the
palate
dubbel
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
styles
but
pere
jacques
is
just
a
bit
off
would
pair
well
with
lighter
chocolate
plain
unsalted
nuts
and
grilled
pineapple
o
definitely
a
good
beer
an
excellent
dubbel
will
be
interested
to
see
how
the
bottle
in
the
cellar
ages
and
compare
o
this
is
a
2012
version
so
i
will
say
this
much
keep
these
amazing
brews
coming
again
i
dont
have
access
to
much
goose
but
wow
i
am
impressed
with
another
great
beer
from
them
dont
change
a
thing
about
this
brewery
please
very
drinkable
easy
to
sip
on
this
all
evening
one
of
the
better
selections
from
goose
island
impressive
this
has
superb
balance
with
the
flavouraromas
meshing
perfectly
the
body
is
fantastic
with
creamy
smoothness
and
restrained
carbonation
a
hard
beer
to
fault
yet
i
cant
help
getting
the
impression
that
something
small
is
missing
the
malt
not
quite
dark
or
rich
enough
perhaps
an
element
of
depth
is
absent
nonetheless
this
is
a
top
tier
brew
that
is
very
tasty
and
well
worth
sampling
grab
one
if
you
see
it
o
definite
mustbuy
i
will
revisit
this
beer
every
time
it
comes
out
into
my
local
store
not
hugely
overpowering
so
a
more
drinkable
beer
for
summer
o
havent
had
this
fresh
or
aged
in
a
while
but
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
when
i
did
doubt
itll
improve
with
more
time
but
it
developed
nicely
over
7
years
pours
a
murky
honey
brown
with
a
beige
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
and
brown
sugar
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
some
slight
herbal
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
smells
mine
says

abv
and
22012
poured
into
a
20
oz
duvel
tulip
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
huge
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
smell
is
clove
dark
fruits
banana
brown
sugar
and
marshmallow
taste
is
similar
clove
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
are
the
main
attraction
body
is
large
nice
amount
of
life
not
dry
and
easy
drinking
for
what
it
is
not
a
belgian
fanatic
but
this
is
very
good
notes
kind
of
bland
not
bad
flavor
wise
and
it
delivers
the
dark
sweetness
and
fruit
but
i
just
dont
really
want
to
drink
more
decent
but
there
are
so
many
better
beers
and
dubbels
o
a
sipper
and
a
decent
dubbel
with
nice
belgian
flavors
the
only
downside
is
the
alcohol
aftertaste
is
a
little
harsh
originally
reviewed
11082010
o
i
think
this
beer
rocks
and
should
get
more
credit
really
good
served
on
draft
in
a
goblet
lace
quickly
dissipates
but
the
color
is
nicealmost
garnet
good
carbonation
and
distinct
banana
something
i
found
interesting
for
a
belgian
dubbelstyle
ale
not
a
particularly
long
finish
but
a
nice
malty
sweetness
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
seasonal
from
these
guys
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
bottle
states
this
beer
can
age
up
to
5
years
but
is
drinking
just
fine
after
10
months
of
cellaring
overall
a
really
nice
belgian
ale
and
a
solid
sipper
could
hold
up
fairly
well
but
this
is
nice
as
is
pours
a
nice
ruby
tinted
amber
with
one
finger
of
head
that
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
no
remnant
of
its
existence
the
smell
is
a
nice
balance
of
bready
malts
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
and
just
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
the
caramel
and
the
yeast
character
combine
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
to
give
off
a
nice
okay
vanilla
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
really
coats
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
really
interesting
dubbel
the
oaky
vanilla
almost
implies
a
light
barrel
aging
but
instead
seems
to
come
from
the
ingredients
themselves
overall
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
especially
fresh
if
i
get
the
chance
pours
a
cloudy
redish
color
with
a
very
active
rising
white
head
has
that
funky
sourish
yeasty
smell
to
it
and
an
overload
of
malty
sweetness
flavor
is
interesting
if
a
bit
out
of
balance
not
sure
id
call
this
a
proper
dubbel
more
of
a
belgian
style
amber
ale
caramel
malts
conflict
with
the
tart
yeast
and
the
result
is
not
amazing
like
the
matilda
plenty
of
residual
sugars
around
as
well
the
most
dominant
taste
to
me
especially
on
the
front
end
is
unfiltered
fresh
apple
cider
which
is
fine
but
im
not
confident
it
belongs
in
a
dubbel
feel
was
good
though
robust
carbonation
lightens
it
up
a
bit
and
a
fairly
full
body
for
the
style
is
appreciated
here
overall
a
slighly
off
attempt
in
my
book
the
other
beers
in
this
series
are
far
better
but
the
fruity
tones
make
an
interesting
autumn
feeling
drink
the
beer
was
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
and
it
appears
a
dark
rubybrown
coloring
with
only
a
hint
of
filmy
coating
on
the
surface
of
the
brew
aromas
of
rich
layered
sweetness
including
dates
raisins
plums
and
a
slight
sugary
highlight
flavors
are
light
and
slightly
sharp
on
the
crisp
body
and
lead
off
with
a
tangy
slightly
sour
sweetness
with
all
of
the
fruit
profiles
blending
together
earthy
notes
accent
all
of
the
sweetness
to
keep
it
from
cloying
the
beer
transitions
to
a
darkly
sweet
rich
aftertaste
of
roasted
sweetness
a
smooth
rich
finish
that
stays
light
with
an
increased
carbonation
decent
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
this
was
a
sweet
mediumbodied
dubbel
easy
to
drink
on
tap
at
south
park
abbey
in
san
diego
served
in
a
leffe
globe
decent
foam
on
the
amber
brew
nothing
special
overall
i
have
not
had
this
for
a
few
years
and
it
seems
not
to
have
made
an
impression
on
me
then
for
some
reason
the
matilda
tasted
really
sensational
to
me
on
tap
last
time
mvery
heavy
and
syrupy
flat
so
not
my
fav
but
i
will
pretend
it
is
more
carbonated
as
i
am
sure
it
was
at
one
time
past
its
prime
on
this
one
d
id
swear
this
was
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
if
it
wasnt
and
this
developed
this
character
on
its
own
then
wow
not
super
complex
but
very
rich
and
tons
of
depth
not
super
belgian
but
it
has
enough
of
the
expected
aspects
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
with
a
well
disguised
abv
o
very
nice
really
enjoyed
this
one
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
mostly
clear
golden
brown
with
a
fingers
breadth
of
fluffy
white
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
ample
streams
of
bubbly
carbonation
aroma
of
bready
yeast
bubblegum
banana
esters
dried
fruits
taste
was
a
little
offputting
at
first
with
perhaps
just
more
earthy
funk
than
i
expected
otherwise
thick
sugary
sweetness
yeast
raisins
pears
overripe
bananas
medium
mouthfeel
pretty
chewy
a
decent
drink
overall
but
not
something
id
want
to
drink
regularly
poured
a
brief
whisper
of
a
head
which
vanished
immediately
the
body
is
a
hazy
apple
cider
appearance
theres
not
a
lot
of
smell
to
it
but
there
are
hints
it
may
taste
of
malt
and
dried
fruit
and
voila
yes
there
is
some
in
the
taste
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
belgian
originals
although
i
respect
goose
island
tried
to
replicate
the
belgian
experience
alas
in
this
sample
they
fell
far
short
o
good
dinner
beer
one
of
the
most
drinkable
gi
brews
ive
had
a
nice
dubbel
this
is
a
decent
american
take
on
the
belgian
dubbel
style
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
lacks
the
depth
that
i
want
in
this
style
its
good
but
not
exceptional
overall
i
think
it
is
a
pretty
good
dubbel
easy
to
drink
and
quite
pleasant
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
belgian
ales
overall
a
sophisticated
and
restrained
had
a
2011
bottle
of
pere
jacques
and
it
was
a
decent
beer
the
appearance
was
a
clean
amber
with
vitrually
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
to
me
was
one
of
apple
wine
the
taste
had
an
almost
barley
wine
zeal
with
apple
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
in
body
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
it
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
it
seemed
to
grow
on
me
2010
bottle
properly
cellared
poured
into
a
caracole
small
snifter
pours
a
medium
to
dark
coppery
orange
amber
half
finger
fine
offwhite
head
and
lacing
nice
continual
carbonation
keeps
a
thin
head
active
mild
aroma
of
dark
fruit
and
caramel
malt
one
year
has
mellowed
the
flavor
to
a
pleasant
well
integrated
blend
of
dark
fruit
sweet
and
caramel
malt
the
hops
have
largely
attenuated
pleasant
light
oxidation
elements
medium
bodied
with
some
creaminess
very
nice
more
of
a
dubbel
flavor
now
than
the
original
sidebyside
with
a
2011
the
fresher
bottle
has
more
intense
flavors
of
fruit
and
hops
this
older
one
more
integrated
both
are
very
nice
obesides
the
poor
appearance
a
nice
dubbel
doa
overall
keep
drinking
more
definitely
not
enough
lets
be
honest
the
goal
is
to
find
it
so
you
can
keep
handy
in
your
fridge
salud
a
fairly
good
beer
and
one
of
the
more
complex
abbey
ales
that
ive
ever
had
o
a
very
nice
belgian
dubbel
i
think
it
will
be
better
when
the
malty
sweetness
diminishes
with
age
a
bit
i
did
a
little
cellar
cleaning
and
decided
to
crack
one
of
these
open
i
had
it
fresh
at
a
beer
tasting
and
bought
some
to
put
in
my
cellar
its
a
nice
beer
but
i
think
i
liked
it
better
fresh
the
next
time
i
make
a
conscious
decision
to
put
an
abbeystyle
ale
in
my
cellar
for
a
year
or
more
im
going
to
make
it
a
real
abbeystyle
ale
still
this
stuff
is
not
bad
single
finger
head
with
a
little
retention
and
nice
lacing
on
a
brownish
amber
hazy
body
very
nice
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
aroma
near
perfect
flavor
is
a
nice
musty
dried
dark
fruit
mostly
raisins
and
fig
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
with
a
semi
dry
finish
overall
a
very
good
beer
more
on
the
belgian
dark
strong
side
wish
i
could
get
this
one
in
florida
o
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
dubbels
ive
had
going
to
set
one
down
for
a
few
years
and
see
what
happens
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
reddish
highlights
a
very
bubbly
one
finger
cocoa
head
in
my
snifter
glass
very
uneven
fairly
clear
in
appearance
even
with
the
darker
color
the
smell
rated
to
style
is
very
weak
i
get
earthy
malts
and
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
and
small
amount
of
spice
its
really
on
the
weak
side
almost
watered
down
fortunately
the
taste
is
better
i
get
belgian
yeast
caramel
dark
fruit
malt
and
mild
spices
its
just
a
little
too
clean
tasting
for
me
compared
with
the
best
belgians
dubbels
the
feel
is
very
light
little
carbonation
and
goes
down
very
clean
id
like
a
little
more
meat
in
the
feel
overall
this
is
a
good
dubbel
but
there
are
better
choices
out
there
to
try
cheers
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
wouldnt
go
seeking
it
out
there
are
better
dubbers
out
there
that
are
far
more
complex
o
good
sweet
and
tasty
overall
the
flavor
is
a
little
onedimensional
maybe
also
a
little
too
sweet
lacks
complexity
and
depth
there
are
plenty
of
other
better
dubbels
out
there
to
choose
from
pours
a
medium
brown
with
some
red
highlights
good
solid
cap
of
foam
diminishes
into
a
circle
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
scent
leads
with
sweet
notes
of
toffee
light
breadyness
and
hints
of
fruit
like
cherry
and
raisin
taste
a
touch
more
aggressive

sweet

of
cherry
raisin

hint
of

a
nice
take
on
the

ridiculous
super

not
too
carbonated

like
something
god
has
in
his
cellar
superb
o
i
liked
this
dubbel
but
it
never
wowd
me
at
any
certain
point
i
thought
it
was
good
and
true
to
style
throughout
but
never
excellent

for
the
style
more

pretty
smooth

down
a
solid
offering
from
gi
and
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
this
is
a
really
good
take
on
the
belgian
dubbel
it
is
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
not
only
because
of
the
alcohol
but
also
because
each
sip
brings
something
new
to
the
palate
due
to
its
complexity
verdict
in
all
honesty
i
dont
think
this
beer
really
benefitted
from
aging
its
still
a
good
beer
and
was
pleasant
to
drink
but
not
overwhelming
and
a
bit
over
hyped
o
well
done
pretty
decent
brew
with
some
age
on
it
was
it
worth
waiting
18
months
meh
not
really
o
a
well
crafted
beer
and
very
enjoyable
not
quite
as
exquisite
as
some
other
abbey
styles
that
i
have
had
like
st
bernardus
8
but
that
wont
stop
me
from
picking
up
more
of
this
overall
a
nice
dubbels
and
one
that
will
make
me
revisit
the
style
more
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
dubbels
but
this
one
gives
me
reason
to
reconnect
with
a
previously
discarded
style
passed
on
from
my
brother
cloudy
dark
brown
pour
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
smell
is
sugary
with
a
caramel
and
malty
smell
sticking
out
toffee
sweet
and
bready
dark
fruit
and
yeast
really
stick
out
in
this
beer
not
something
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
enjoyable
overall
overall
a
nice
american
dubble
it
didnt
start
off
strong
but
it
finished
well
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
however
not
the
best
belgianamerican
ive
had
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
decent
amount
of
stuff
going
on
here
ultimately
its
losing
a
little
in
the
long
run
spices
and
sweetness
are
overpowering
after
half
a
glass
shows
the
usual
depth
and
nuance
expected
from
goose
island
o
this
has
a
lot
going
on
with
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
these
are
mostly
good
things
the
alcohol
come
through
nicely
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
and
balances
out
everything
else
that
is
going
on
the
flavor
is
similar
with
notes
of
candied
fruits
and
crusty
bread
its
pleasant
but
heavy
on
the
palate
and
with
a
strong
alcohol
kick
8
this
ones
a
sipper
i
like
pere
jacques
but
wonder
what
it
would
taste
like
with
a
few
years
of
aging
to
smooth
it
all
out
o
this
brew
really
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
the
more
subtle
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
started
to
come
out
from
the
year
of
aging
and
really
helped
to
round
the
body
out
honestly
ive
never
had
this
fresh
but
i
cant
imagine
it
being
better
than
this
1yr
old
bottle
mouth
sharp
tight
carbonation
but
not
too
much
of
it
medium
heavy
body
syrupy
sticky
drink
for
dessert
overall
a
very
drinkable
take
on
the
style
id
like
to
compare
this
vintage
with
a
fresh
bottle
to
see
how
the
carbonation
and
head
retention
differ
a
good
one
this
was
an
acceptable
dubbel
i
enjoyed
components
of
each
category
but
together
this
isnt
anything
special
particularly
when
higher
quality
belgians
are
available
from
belgium
at
a
similar
price
point
its
more
one
delicious
beer
to
come
from
goose
island
overall
really
flavorful
and
rich
and
still
easy
to
drink
more
malty
then
most
dubbels
and
that
adds
to
a
change
of
pace
session
beer
would
be
a
great
beer
to
age
but
still
good
to
drink
fresh
i
like
it
of
all
of
the
dubbles
that
i
have
tried
so
far
its
currently
the
best
intersection
of
price
availability
and
quality
i
plan
to
keep
a
4
pack
of
it
around
pretty
much
all
the
time
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
imagine
it
would
age
very
well
excellent
dubbel
perfect
for
a
rainy
night
overall
a
nice
belgium
ale
with
an
8
alcohol
level
is
a
have
one
and
enjoy
and
move
on
the
mouthfeel
is
leaning
towards
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
the
malty
caramel
and
dark
fruit
flavors
were
very
nice
in
it
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
and
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
overall
there
is
a
good
beer
in
here
i
just
think
it
is
going
to
take
some
age
to
get
it
to
come
out
o
not
the
best
ive
had
for
the
style
but
better
than
i
expected
o
i
really
like
the
taste
even
though
it
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
it
manages
strong
malt
flavors
and
balanced
yeast
flavors
without
off
notes
fix
the
appearance
and
perhaps
add
some
hops
to
add
spicy
notes
and
we
have
a
westmalle
contender
overall
drinkability
pretty
mild
unchallenging
for
a
dubbel
i
wanted
to
love
this
beer
but
it
just
has
too
much
stiff
competition
in
the
style
maybe
a
candidate
for
aging
the
sugars
might
mellow
out
making
this
thing
drinkable
o
a
nice
dubbel
with
surprising
flavours
given
the
relatively
muted
smell
profile
o
wow
what
a
find
i
really
enjoy
dubbels
and
this
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
really
smooth
and
pleasant
to
drink
overall
a
very
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
the
richness
and
strength
make
this
a
sipper
best
shared
very
well
done
abbey
ale
by
goose
island
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
i
probably
need
to
try
this
one
before
ive
had
an
ipa
but
still
the
sweetness
is
more
that
i
like
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
regularly
but
im
not
mad
that
i
tried
it
disappointing
a
little
to
me
as
i
thought
that
this
would
stronger
with
better
flavor
but
it
was
too
sweet
and
bordered
on
sour
like
a
warm
red
wine
cooler
maybe
that
was
too
harsh
but
i
love
most
of
goose
islands
other
beers
and
this
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
it
was
ok
but
didnt
blow
me
away
ill
try
it
again
next
year
when
the
next
batch
is
released
good
dubbel
complex
and
tasty
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
id
rather
take
a
true
belgian
dubbel
its
decent
but
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
it
again
itd
be
interesting
to
try
aged
longer
i
am
definitely
a
fan
of
this
one
and
have
had
it
numerous
times
at
various
stages
of
agingfreshness
would
love
to
grab
a
4
pack
and
stash
it
in
the
cellar
sometime
just
havent
gotten
around
to
it
yet
im
not
the
hugest
dubbel
fan
but
this
one
grabbed
my
affection
from
the
start
simply
put
delicious
it
was
good
but
honestly
if
it
sat
on
the
shelves
at
my
local
beer
station
i
would
probably
pick
something
else
up
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
prefer
it
a
little
more
fresh
i
have
had
it
on
tap
a
few
times
and
prefer
that
the
flavors
in
this
2009
seem
a
little
muted
now
i
gotta
get
back
to
the
bottle
store
and
get
a
fresh
one
to
compare
i
gotta
remember
to
check
dates
next
time
lol
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
not
sure
if
the
age
has
contributed
to
the
how
prevalent
the
sweetness
is
but
it
seems
like
this
beer
is
a
dubbelbarleywine
hybrid
overall
its
a
decent
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
bit
of
slickness
that
is
perfectly
balanced
by
ample
carbonation
o
a
good
beer
though
not
at
the
top
of
its
class
o
belgian
dubbels
arent
really
my
favorite
style
but
i
like
to
revisit
things
and
i
want
to
try
reviewing
different
style
beers
as
well
overall
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
the
stronger
points
of
the
beer
personally
i
got
alot
of
licorice
and
dried
fruit
which
i
just
dont
enjoy
i
understand
its
part
of
the
style
of
beer
a
good
take
on
the
style
and
a
well
crafted
beer
just
not
my
thing
will
like
to
revisit
again
once
they
are
aged
seems
like
a
pretty
standard
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
style
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
the
style
o
what
a
complex
beer
amazing
easily
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
so
far
being
my
first
aged
beer
i
am
very
excited
for
all
the
other
beers
i
have
aging
d
great
dubbel
shitty
pourbottle
handling
are
my
biggest
complaints
overall
great
aroma
and
flavor
probably
quite
good
for
the
style
and
a
good
sipping
beer
although
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
d
smooth
warm
and
wet
pours
a
see
through
amber
very
nice
smelling
belgian
yeast
is
very
noticeable
first
and
foremost
smells
like
a
caramel
apple
light
hops
taste
is
similar
love
the
yeast
very
fruity
dark
fruit
slight
tinge
on
the
finish
no
dryness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
thickens
up
a
bit
as
it
warms
solid
beer
overall
just
became
one
of
my
favorites
from
goose
island
hopefully
not
just
in
time
for
ab
to
kill
them
o
a
pleasant
take
on
the
style
only
have
one
in
the
house
but
would
gladly
have
another
if
it
were
here
would
likely
buy
it
again
they
were
pouring
the
2010
vintage
at
julios
belgian
fest
on
august
14
2011
the
color
was
a
medium
to
dark
amber
with
a
nice
foamy
head
up
top
that
lingers
for
a
spell
the
aroma
was
surprisingly
sweet
and
while
dubbels
can
be
sweet
this
seemed
a
bit
like
overkill
there
was
a
vague
hop
note
on
the
backside
except
for
the
sweetness
it
seemed
fairly
wellbalanced
the
body
was
medium
the
taste
was
also
a
bit
more
sweet
than
i
might
have
liked
and
there
was
little
to
the
finish
a
slight
letdown
but
not
bad
smell
taste
the
aroma
is
spicy
including
cloves
with
malts
but
not
sign
of
hops
excepting
a
slight
bitterness
that
is
largely
overwhelmed
by
both
sweetness
and
tartness
dark
fruit
aroma
abounds
but
is
even
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
lightly
earthy
with
hints
of
cinnamon
raisins
and
root
beer
plenty
of
flavor
and
more
complexity
than
my
first
impression
indicated
id
like
to
try
an
aged
bottle
down
the
road
o
found
it
to
be
an
incredible
representation
of
the
style
not
as
intense
as
i
had
expected
and
much
smoother
than
anticipated
two
thumbs
up
here
o
glad
i
found
this
never
have
heard
of
or
seen
before
so
i
bought
a
4
pack
i
wouldnt
put
it
with
a
rochefort
but
not
that
bad
all
in
all
will
get
again
and
share
with
buddies
who
respect
the
craft
beer
i
mistook
this
beer
for
a
lighter
saisonstyle
just
by
the
front
label
alone
i
was
so
anxious
to
try
what
i
thought
was
a
fresh
saison
i
got
a
little
concerened
when
it
poured
such
a
dark
color
of
well
its
90f
outside
but
im
inside
where
the
ac
is
kickin
so
a
warming
belgianstyle
dubbel
isnt
so
outofplace
after
all
great
rendition
of
the
style
kudos
to
goose
price
3
25
at
the
new
beer
distributors
nyc
carbonation
was
lacking
it
was
a
bit
watery
felt
like
it
needed
more
body
to
substaniate
the
intense
flavor
of
this
dubbel
salud
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
dubbel
that
was
slightly
above
average
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
in
the
right
direction
but
there
were
too
many
things
that
made
it
rough
around
the
edges
i
thought
it
was
weird
that
the
aroma
had
such
a
dominating
spice
aspect
to
it
but
when
it
came
to
the
taste
the
spices
take
the
backseat
to
all
those
sweet
and
fruity
flavors
from
the
malts
i
felt
that
it
was
just
a
touch
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
could
have
been
hidden
better
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
its
nice
and
complex
aroma
and
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
its
high
amount
of
sweetness
and
how
much
the
8
showed
up
this
beer
doesnt
have
good
drinkability
it
took
me
a
while
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
and
it
was
a
bit
of
a
struggle
towards
the
end
i
would
never
want
to
drink
more
then
one
of
these
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
it
just
didnt
impress
me
i
would
much
rather
have
the
dubbel
from
bridge
brew
works
if
dubbels
are
your
thing
you
might
want
to
give
it
a
try
but
dont
expect
to
be
wowed
this
has
been
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
goose
island
but
that
still
doesnt
make
it
a
good
beer
i
have
come
to
grips
with
the
fact
that
i
am
just
not
into
this
brewery
but
their
line
of
belgian
beers
always
catches
my
attention
maybe
i
will
give
some
of
their
other
beers
a
chance
but
with
their
track
record
i
doubt
it
i
enjoyed
this
beer
would
have
preferred
less
sweetness
and
a
little
more
carbonation
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
the
style
overall
an
average
dubbel
notes
this
is
a
good
brew
but
to
me
it
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
an
old
ale
with
a
belgium
twist
and
in
that
regard
while
pleasing
it
did
not
quite
do
it
for
me
overall
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
but
ive
had
way
too
many
better
dubbels
then
this
one
if
the
carbonation
level
was
a
little
higher
i
bet
that
this
brew
would
have
tasted
less
sweet
to
me
i
would
have
most
likely
bumped
this
up
the
overall
from
3
5
to
a
4
overall
what
we
found
to
be
the
most
exciting
aspect
of
this
brew
was
the
way
that
all
of
the
flavor
components
blended
together
while
it
had
sweetness
as
well
as
serious
malt
activity
the
two
were
married
in
the
most
harmonious
fashion
it
can
be
easy
to
sway
the
entire
flavor
profile
towards
one
way
or
the
other
with
a
dubbel
but
this
beer
finds
a
gorgeous
balance
d
good
flavor
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
ill
stop
at
one
o
pretty
decent
i
feel
like
the
raisindate
flavor
is
a
tiny
touch
overpowering
but
otherwise
this
is
quite
a
nice
dubbel
alcohol
is
a
little
too
present
in
smell
and
flavor
despite
the
relatively
low
abv
not
too
bland
like
dubbels
can
be
at
least
o
overall
i
think
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
style
ales
i
really
liked
the
caramel
and
nuts
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
and
the
feel
of
the
beer
was
great
to
me
the
only
thing
that
would
get
to
me
after
about
15oz
of
it
would
be
the
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
taste
but
not
too
much
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
to
belgian
beer
fans
cheers
the
taste
vaguely
reminds
of
red
wine
minus
the
rich
malt
character
some
pepper
and
clove
from
the
yeast
again
lots
of
grape
date
and
kiwi
the
finish
is
malty
but
alcoholic
and
gives
the
sensation
of
menthol
overall
a
bit
overwhelming
as
far
as
alcohol
body
is
thick
and
flavor
is
intense
at
8
abv
im
surprised
that
the
alcohol
isnt
better
integrated
in
this
beer
pours
a
ruddy
amber
with
orange
hues
dirty
white
cap
lingers
long
after
a
gentle
pour
smells
of
brandy
tangerines
dates
spiciness
candi
sugar
light
fruit
taste
is
brandy
caramel
sugar
dates
raisins
sweet
breadiness
not
excessively
spicy
which
is
something
i
appreciate
and
dont
enjoy
much
a
plus
for
this
one
mouthfeel
is
thick
yet
smooth
carbonation
is
medium
with
large
slow
bubbles
afterfeel
is
surprisingly
clean
and
smooth
there
is
a
nice
melding
of
flavors
here
pretty
high
residual
sweetness
but
it
is
well
balanced
with
alcohol
very
friuty
and
malty
as
advertised
i
must
get
some
more
of
this
stuff
to
age
o
enjoyed
the
bottle
very
much
would
definitely
have
more
i
would
say
it
is
right
in
with
style
and
better
than
most
out
there

2009

taste
however
more
than
makes
up
for
the
flat
smell
loads
of
dried
fruity
things
leather
and
an
old
rope
or
two
lively
body
with
a
good
amount
of
fizz
but
not
overly
so
piles
of
sediment
at
the
end
which
i
know
people
say
youre
supposed
to
leave
in
the
bottle
but
thats
stupid
drink
the
schmutz
youll
be
much
happier
for
it
lets
hope
that
the
recent
acquisition
of
gi
by
abinbev
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
or
the
brewery
it
pours
very
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
notes
and
a
light
brown
head
nose
is
fruity
brown
ale
but
the
taste
is
a
step
up
from
thatincredibly
complex
with
layers
of
toffee
nuts
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
allspice
rum
apricot
its
on
the
sweet
side
i
suppose
but
has
so
many
layers
of
sweetnessand
a
healthy
amount
of
spicethat
its
a
really
great
beer
for
dessert
i
imagine
it
would
also
pair
well
with
cheese
or
with
a
warm
loaf
of
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
really
creamy
and
full
with
a
spritely
carbonation
that
keeps
it
from
weighing
you
down
im
going
to
go
rush
out
and
buy
myself
some
as
soon
as
i
finish
writing
this
review
o
really
good
beer
for
the
style
and
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
its
easy
to
find
in
upstate
ny
and
fairly
price
nothing
i
would
crave
however
so
i
wont
be
rushing
out
anytime
soon
and
grabbing
more
overall
great
beer
all
around
drinkability
was
the
only
downer
and
was
very
full
afterwards
im
hoping
i
can
get
my
hands
on
one
of
these
and
age
it
for
a
few
years
very
good
quality
brew
and
one
of
my
favorites
from

not

easydrinking

completely

quite
tasty
and
a
good
value

a

an

the

is
of
caramel
and
rich
malts
as
well
as
some
dark

taste
is
clean
and
spicy
a
bit
of
earthiness
and
a
warm
toastiness
all
the
while
a
sweet
and
sticky
afterfinish
lingers
along
with
some
pleasant
hop
bitterness
all
in
all
a
very
refined
and
tasty
dubbel
very
good
a
very
good
beer
with
a
amble
ivory
head
and
a
nice
amber
clear
color
aroma
is
slightly
floral
but
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
warming
in
the
mouth
with
a
slight
thickness
and
a
creaminess
sweet
taste
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
went
well
with
my
very
hot

at
croxleys

in
franklin
square
ny
couple
fingers
worth
of
frothy

to
the

too
slick
to
stick

brightness
given
the

loosely
organized
but
active
bubbles
percolate
throughout

you
start
pouring
the
bottom

imagine

nothing

biting
fullbodied

on
the
heavy
side
the
carbonation
has
the
texture
of
cotton
candy
more
gluey
than
lifting
in
spite
of
this
theres
more
room
for
more
focused
clove
ginger
and
pepper
spice
quinine
and
earth
this
forestalls
the
eventual
onslaught
of
caramel
toffee
molasses
maple
syrup
chocolate
and
so
on
the
orange
to
lemon
citrus
retains
that
syrupy
and
candied

yeastiness

with
that
bubblegum

nice
mix
of
darker

booziness
elevates
as
it
warms

all

the
cpj
o
certainly
a
solid
beer
but
not
my
favorite
dubbel
nor
the
best
of
the
goose
island
offerings
pours
a
murky
dirty
brown
with
a
slight
rosy
hue
around
the
edges
its
unfortunate
that
the
first
impression
is
peres
lessthanattractive
presentationcolor
but
its
all
uphill
from
here
the
smell
is
like
holding
a
fine
cigar
right
underneath
your
nose
and
the
taste
is
of
rich
tobacco
and
sweet
licorice
the
live
yeast
while
adding
to
the
beers
cloudy
pour
and
murky
looks
holds
its
own
in
the
flavor
profile
while
it
did
some
work
over
the
past
2
years
in
the
bottle
to
continue
the
fermentation
process
theres
still
plenty
of
residual
sugars
that
linger
overall
another
excellent
goose
island
belgian
style
within
the
truly
elite
lineup
sofie
matilda
etc
once
again
an
american
version
of
a
belgian
style
that
is
far
too
sweet
well
done
but
does
not
talk
to
me
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
excellent
representation
of
style
beginning
to
enjoy
goose
island
with
each
of
their
beers
i
try
o
i
wish
i
could
get
some
of
this
to
celllar
for
23
years
this
is
a
superior
dubbel
with
dark
fruit
qualities
that
are
toptier
and
drink
as
smoothly
as
any
belgian
dubbel
i
have
had
i
like
malty
belgians
so
this
one
fits
my
likes
as
well
as
any
brew
in
the
style
great
job
goose
island

narrative
he
twisted
the
tuning
keys
backstage
hearing
the
crowd
chanting
and
awaiting
him
to
open
with
his
new
hit
single
however
the
only
thing
that
he
would
provide
would
be
a
soft
melodious
performance
his
fingers
lithely
fingering
the
fretboard
with
threadbare
precision
mediocre
in
style
but
with
precision
in
the
mediocrity
od
probably
the
tastiest
dubbel
ive
had
to
date
very
drinkable
very
tasty
very
aromatic
and
i
would
love
to
have
a
case
of
this
for
home
o
excellent
american
dubbel
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it

update
back
to
this
beer
after
2
years
in
the
cellar
similar
appearance
as
the
freshie
but
with
plenty
of
sediment
aroma
is
a
hint
sweeter
ripe
grapes
predominant
now
vs
the
initial
caramel
toasty
malt
character
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
heavy
on
sweetness
which
covers
up
the
alcohol
bite
that
was
initially
present
and
no
astringency
here
either
anymore
the
mouthfeel
has
definitely
gotten
thicker
with
just
a
bit
of
cloying
sweetness
still
plenty
of
carbonation
here
overall
i
think
this
beer
has
improved
with
age
as
it
is
more
like
the
good
belgians
id
give
it
a
solid
3
75
now
glad
i
held
these
as
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
fresh
probably
time
to
drink
more
i
think
its
at
its
peak
and
about
to
become
too
sweet
and
cloying
ill
hold
a
couple
to
see
o
i
really
liked
everything
about
this
dubbel
i
may
have
to
start
buying
this
each
time
it
comes
out
if
youre
into
dubbels
belgian
beers
or
malt
check
this
one
out
overall
its
almost
as
expensive
as
a
fine
belgian
dubbel
and
not
quite
as
good
so
it
doesnt
make
it
into
my
fridge
very
often
however
it
is
a
respectable
beer
as
far
as
belgian
style
beers
from
american
breweries
go
mouthfeel
is
meduim
to
light
im
torn
about
how
much
i
care
for
this
one
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
driknkability
is
about
a
5
or
6
out
of
10
for
me
prosit
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
some
interesting
flavours
i
wasnt
expecting
a
touch
sweet
but
still
solid
definitely
looking
forward
to
my
other
bottles
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
great
but
very
good
too
sweet
to
be
considered
a
true
dubbel
but
i
really
dont
care
about
style
to
be
honest
o
this
is
far
better
than
i
remember
it
being
ontap
it
is
in
fact
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
had
d
nice
drink
i
the
love
the
job
goose
island
has
done
with
their
supreme
line
of
specialty
beers
the
triple
attack
of
matilda
favorite
sofie
and
pere
jacques
goes
unmatched
for
consistency
and
flavor
could
make
a
great
dessert
or
after
dinner
beer
as
well
texture
and
taste
were
quite
complementarysickeningly
sweeet
and
sticky
to
the
max
quite
frankly
the
absolutely
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
i
will
not
come
this
way
again
and
will
avoid
the
style
in
the
future
o
the
more
this
beer
warms
up
the
more
i
love
it
this
is
usually
the
way
with
belgians
and
belgianadjacent
beers
i
wonder
if
this
axiom
holds
true
with
belgian
people
as
well
if
you
are
looking
for
an
american
belgianstyled
beer
that
is
not
too
funky
yet
has
a
tremendous
amount
of
flavor
and
attitude
i
recommend
this
heavy
and
flat
for
a
dubbel
so
more
a
sipper
but
a
nice
one
at
that
surprisingly
fruity
top
notes
begs
for
food
has
the
big
round
body
that
comes
from
giving
a
beer
some
age
so
im
glad
i
waited
drank
this
cool
not
cold
just
below
room
temperature
and
i
feel
that
the
temp
really
exposed
a
lot
of
the
layers
of
the
beer
rich
and
complex
but
not
overly
ambitious
or
pretentious
a
fine
outing
from
the
gang
at
goose
island
cheers
heres
to
greg
hall
overall
one
of
the
better
sweet
beers
out
there
ive
had
better
and
worse
would
like
to
age
one
for
a
year
though
and
rereview
great
aroma
and
good
flavor
though
the
flavor
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
so
i
have
to
knock
it
there
a
bit
still
very
yummy
mouthfeel
is
full
and
chewy
this
looks
and
tastes
better
than
most
belgians
from
belgium
thats
worth
something
the
biggest
competition
for
this
may
be
from
other
domestics
well
done
this
was
much
better
than
i
remember
it
being
two
or
three
years
ago
maybe
the
best
american
version
of
the
style
ive
had
d
i
was
relly
impressed
by
this
offering
from
goose
island
this
is
easily
the
best
dubbel
made
on
this
side
of
the
pond
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
i
had
this
with
about
11
months
of
age
on
i
could
see
this
going
for
much
longer
highly
recommended
none
of
the
flavors
are
overbearing
which
makes
all
of
its
complexities
understated
and
interesting
while
working
well
and
in
tandem
with
each
other
a
little
too
sweet
and
boring
with
a
strong
boozy
finish
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
dubbel
d
this
is
extremely
easy
drinking
but
the
boozy
smell
does
translate
to
a
boozy
feeling
and
with
8
abv
that
makes
sense
a
bit
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
price
wise
its
a
pretty
good
value
so
i
would
probably
buy
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
to
cellar
and
see
how
it
changes
over
time
wouldnt
go
nuts
with
it
though
another
hit
from
goose
island
drinkability
im
really
liking
this
brew
dubbels
really
havent
been
a
style
that
i
frequently
drink
however
this
one
may
have
changed
my
mind
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
of
this
the
next
time
i
can
cheers
d
a
decent
brew
while
a
touch
out
of
balance
on
the
sweetness
there
are
a
lot
of
good
things
going
for
it
worth
a
try
if
nothing
else
but
to
compare
to
their
other
offerings
drinkability
a
good
solid
dubbel
not
as
classic
as
a
true
belgian
but
at
half
the
cost
per
bottle
something
i
would
drink
regularly
again
served
a
little
bit
colder
than
i
like
but
a
tasty
take
on
a
dubble
nonetheless
d
moderately
drinkable
but
not
too
enjoyable
due
to
the
overwhelming
sweetness
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
total
lack
of
carbonation
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
goose
island
offerings
ive
had
appearance
is
reddish
brown
with
a
small
head
smell
is
a
mix
of
bread
dried
fruits
sweetness
as
well
like
caramel
taking
a
sip
of
pere
jacques
it
it
tastes
of
malt
more
dried
fruit
some
hops
brown
sugar
mf
is
a
bit
like
syrup
pere
jacques
drinks
good
this
is
a
nice
dubbel
one
of
the
better
ones
from
the
u
s
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
little
to
no
alcohol
presence
whatsoever
lacks
in
the
taste
department
but
everything
else
is
great
drinkability
is
high
on
this
there
is
no
taste
of
alcohol
and
it
is
very
smooth
md
pretty
creamy
for
a
belgian
still
pretty
fizzy
though
easy
to
drink
with
zero
alcoholic
burn
as
it
goes
down
not
as
interesting
or
complex
as
i
remember
from
previous
sessions
with
this
brew
but
still
a
solid
offering
good
beer
but
not
seasonable
not
too
rich
decently
smooth
with
a
spot
of
food
could
be
easy
for
another
way
offbalance
with
the
hot
dry
alcohol
becoming
a
definite
turnoff
man
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
too
im
having
a
hard
time
getting
through
the
glass
i
have
kind
of
dread
the
idea
of
another
halfbomber
waiting
for
me
in
the
fridge
id
be
willing
to
try
this
again
sometime
but
this
was
not
a
pleasant
experience
db
pretty
solid
for
an
american
take
on
a
dubbel
the
only
thing
that
gets
to
me
is
the
growing
presence
of
alcohol
flavor
with
time
but
it
still
remains
enjoyable
bottle
bottled
on
071410
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
slightly
hazed
copper
orange
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
off
whtie
head
the
aroma
is
a
very
sweet
cereal
type
with
some
fruit
type
esters
like
pear
and
some
spice
i
am
sort
of
wishing
the
nose
had
a
more
pronounced
aroma
as
it
is
rather
subtle
medium
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
an
aftertaste
of
belgian
abbey
flavors
along
with
some
breadiness
nice
lace
as
i
drink
this
down
ends
rather
dry
with
a
lingering
boozy
flavor
decent
d
a
solid
and
satisfying
malt
bomb
not
the
best
dubbel
but
one
i
would
gladly
recommend
and
seek
out
again
in
the
future
hides
its
8
abv
fairly
well
deeply
satisfying
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
gi
is
producing
some
great
belgian
style
beers
and
this
is
another
one
i
like
dark
amber
in
color
with
fragrant
spicy
notes
upon
first
pour
there
is
definite
carbonation
but
the
foamy
head
quickly
subsides
and
the
pint
glass
resembles
a
glass
of
root
beer
appearance
does
not
impress
first
taste
is
slightly
sweet
but
a
good
mouthfeel
that
carbonation
is
definitely
present
when
drinking
after
taste
is
a
bit
overwhelming
with
the
alcohol
taste
but
it
is
a
high
abv
belgian
and
i
bet
this
gets
much
better
with
age
the
bottle
was
filled
only
6
weeks
ago
so
it
hasnt
had
time
to
mature
yet
very
drinkable
family
beer
over
21
great
with
cheese
pasta
burgers
you
name
it
had
this
with
pizza
and
chicken
wings
this
was
the
2010
vintage
i
realize
they
change
every
year
slightly
though
but
as
long
as
god
the
pope
and
pere
have
any
say
in
this
beer
its
going
to
be
astounding
no
matter
what
year
cheers
the
flavor
matches
the
smell
wellsugary
with
some
alcohol
warmth
very
rich

with
an
equally

the
aftertaste

me
of
toffee
theres
an
element
of
fresh
baked
biscuits

is

it
very
well
made
looks
and
tastes
more
like
a

better
than
an
ommegang

d
good
goose
island
beer
not
my
favorite
style
and
have
not
had
many
dubbels

a
good

only
one

to
be

an
amber
color
with
just
a
slight
off
white
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
smell
is
of
caramel
belgian
yeast
and
alcohol
taste
is
slightly
metalliclike
more
caramel
in
the
malt
some
dark
fruit
mouthfeel
is
flat
and
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
decent
this
isnt
a
mindblowing
beer
but
a
solid
yet
different
dubbel
poured
from
the
bottle
a
deep
ambercopper
color
with
a
bit
of
the
sediment
and
yeast
from
the
bottom
the
head
is
a
nice
thick
pillowy
off
white
that
disapated
into
nice
lacing
for
the
remainder
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
quite
pleasant
dark
fruit
fig
cherry
with
a
good
bit
of
malt
and
earth
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
raisin
fig
cherry
upfront
with
a
good
sweet
brown
sugar
and
malt
backbone
wiht
a
finish
that
is
slighty
dry
and
yeasty
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
not
as
creamy
as
expected
but
still
very
clean
drinkabily
for
this
beer
depends
on
the
drinker
i
found
it
to
be
a
nice
complex
belgian
that
could
use
some
tweaking
but
did
leave
me
wanting
more
and
for
a
high
abv
it
hides
its
alchohol
well
contains
live
yeast
sediment
may
form
yep
but
thats
expected
with
the
style
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
plenty
of
sediment
floating
about
thin
head
is
gone
quickly
nose
is
caramelly
malt
molasses
apples
raisins
a
faint
whiff
of
alcohol
carbonation
strong
up
front
crisp
and
malty
sweet
throughout
from
the
caramel
malt
to
the
dark
fruit
to
the
bready
aftertaste
slight
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
drinkability
one
and
done
but
a
good
dubbel
very
similar
to
the
2009
slightly
less
cloudiness
very
similar
malt
and
yeast
profile
caramel
raisins
and
dates
yeast
complexity
a
bit
subtler
still
quite
good
we
just
call
him
pappy
jack
anyway
it
pours
a
hazy
tawn
topped
by
about
a
halffinger
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
frankly
it
borders
on
a
pumpkin
spice
aroma
but
somethings
missing
from
that
formulation
overall
the
taste
also
leans
toward
this
pumpkin
spice
idea
but
adds
some
banana
and
cedar
allowing
for
some
of
the
belgian
character
to
really
shine
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
dubbel
but
not
something
i
can
rave
too
much
about
to
me
theres
just
not
enough
belgian
quality
for
me
to
really
feel
all
dubbely
bubbly
about
it
the
aroma
has
a
rich
malty
sweetness
that
only
comes
about
in
aged
barleywines
and
belgian
beers
it
is
partly
the
good
kind
of
oxidation
flavor
is
full
complex
again
very
rich
and
without
a
hint
of
alcohol
overall
this
easily
becomes
a
great
dubbel
just
great
d
pere
jacques
has
aged
well
a
very
solid
dubbel
with
nice
complexity
and
ample
carbonation
this
one
wont
blow
your
mind
but
its
very
solid
in
every
aspect
a
good
sipper
during
any
time
of
the
year
d
it
goes
down
easy
and
nothing
prevents
me
from
wanting
more
d
out
of
the
specialty
belgians
from
goose
island
i
would
go
with
one
of
the
others
overall
another
solid
offering
from
goose
island
here
very
good
rendition
of
style
here
extremely
drinkable
and
tasty
not
too
heavy
or
cloying
but
very
full
of
flavor
my
sample
is
the
2010
release
this
beer
pours
with
a
hiss
of
carbonation
in
the
glass
that
settles
fairly
quickly
the
smell
is
sugary
and
grainy
mouthfeel
is
coating
and
slick
flavor
profile
is
somewhat
fruity
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
background
overall
this
is
a
very
sweet
dubbel
though
not
cloying
it
masks
the
8
00
abv
very
well
given
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
this
is
a
onebottle
treat
the
taste
is
a
bit
bland
as
there
really
arent
any
complexities
showing
through
and
there
is
just
a
generic
dark
malt
and
fruit
combination
without
much
more
there
mouth
is
a
bit
creamy
on
a
medium
body
drinks
okay
but
this
is
a
bit
less
than
the
type
of
belgianstyle
ale
than
i
expect
from
goose
nice
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
medium
appropriate
carbonation
smooth
and
drinkable
recommended
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
dubbel
but
seemed
somewhat
subdued
compared
to
many
others
its
almost
like
a
wine
and
it
hangs
in
the
mouth
i
dig
it
but
its
not
one
to
drink
a
lot
of
would
be
a
bit
much
i
bet
its
great
paired
with
the
right
meal
though
now
time
to
get
a
case
of
this
and
throw
it
in
the
basement
d
very
drinkable
for
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
but
nothing
that
really
sings
or
is
that
inviting
its
intriguing
there
are
some
very
good
flavors
here
and
its
like
the
best
ones
are
hiding
under
the
surface
maybe
another
batch
in
the
future
but
for
now
my
imagination
is
better
than
the
actual
product
other
bottle
develops
in
the
next
couple
of
years
d
very
nice
example
of
a
classic
belgian
dubbel
very
flavorful
skillfully
balanced
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
more
of
the
goose
island
offerings
o
the
price
is
on
the
level
of
better
examples
of
this
style
and
id
have
to
say
that
id
probably
turn
to
the
belgians
before
this
one
again
overall
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
beer
the
first
time
i
drank
it
unaccompanied
at
room
temperature
the
8
0
abv
was
painfully
obvious
and
made
it
slightly
difficult
to
finish
this
time
i
enjoyed
it
slightly
chilled
with
a
full
dinner
spicy
pasta
alla
carbonara
and
greek
salad
and
the
flavours
of
the
beer
were
perfectly
complimented
and
balanced
by
the
meal
trust
me
accompany
with
this
with
a
fullflavoured
meal
it
is
an
entirely
different
experience
pours
a
tree
bark
brown
with
a
about
a
half
inch
head
smells
very
much
like
a
dubbel
really
not
much
to
write
home
about
except
that
it
is
a
good
attempt
at
making
a
belgian
style
dubbel
it
is
very
drinkable
but
does
however
feel
very
sticky
in
the
mouth
a
good
session
beer
nonetheless
a
little
pricey
in
my
opinion
and
is
probably
my
least
favorite
from
the
series
d
quite
a
surprising
little
beer
that
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
presence
but
nothing
that
slowed
me
through
the
bottle
poured
on
a
pint
glass
and
it
had
an
amber
brown
tones
along
a
yellow
medium
crown
a
little
foggy
on
the
glass
nice
carbonation
nice
body
sweet
malts
on
the
aromas
along
with
some
raisins
fruits
and
some
floral
hints
pretty
much
the
same
taste
as
on
the
nose
with
very
little
alcohol
present
which
is
nicely
concealed
in
the
explosion
of
flavors
due
to
the
light
yeast
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
lively
theres
a
creamy
texture
and
a
bit
of
booze
in
the
finish
its
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
but
it
lacks
the
personality
id
like
a
bit
more
character
spices
from
the
yeast
and
alcohol
masking
would
make
this
a
much
better
beer
still
worth
a
try
for
any
belgian
beer
lover
d
good
to
very
good
pere
jacques
was
orangebrown
in
color
and
a
little
hazy
it
had
a
short
beige
head
that
didnt
last
terribly
long
with
very
little
residual
lace
the
smell
was
sweet
malt
and
yeast
aromas
the
taste
was
malty
with
some
fruity
yeast
flavors
and
spices
with
some
alcohol
becoming
noticeable
towards
the
finish
the
finish
was
dry
and
lingering
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
nice
carbonation
sort
of
creamy
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
good
dubbel
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
before
i
notice
the
glass
is
half
empty
so
it
must
go
down
rather
well
a
tad
boozy
but
not
excessive
for
the
abv
a
decent
american
take
on
the
belgian
style
but
for
the
money
id
take
an
authentic
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
some
copper
highlights
thin
tan
head
with
fine
bubbles
sweet
malty
nose
with
notes
of
toffee
caramel
red
fruit
and
banana
the
palate
is
full
bodied
loaded
with
sweet
malt
flavor
accompanied
by
red
fruit
nuts
baking
spice
and
banana
d
i
think
this
was
a
very
good
malty
dubbel
lots
of
fruity
and
bready
malts
but
it
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
for
9
abv
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
other
bottle
of
this
i
have
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
too
sweet
and
a
little
unbalanced
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
with
a
dark
caramelmahagony
color
ample
head
of
an
offwhite
color
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
has
a
spicy
nature
with
a
very
malty
background
taste
is
similar
witha
bit
more
spiciness
feel
is
quite
carbonated
a
a
but
on
the
dry
side
overall
a
good
beer
which
i
will
have
again
with
the
opportunity
poured
from
22
oz
into
chalice
clear
and
mahogany
in
color
some
beige
head
retention
and
lacing
minimal
smell
is
of
candy
sweet
malt
with
some
booze
taste
like
lots
of
sweet
malt
some
caramel
some
ripe
fruit
lil
raisin
mouthfeel
was
full
but
smooth
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothin
great
especially
when
compared
with
others
in
this
style
d
drinkable
enough
for
the
style
but
i
find
the
finish
slightly
offputting
though
not
quite
cloying
even
though
this
beer
is
named
for
a
modern
abbot
pere
jacques
is
a
worthy
carrier
of
its
1945
namesake
who
hopefully
will
become
more
well
known
as
a
result
of
the
tribute
this
beer
provides
very
disappointing
brew
ill
try
again
just
in
case
i
had
a
bad
bottle
very
easy
to
drink
with
rather
syrupy
mouth
feel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
i
will
be
interested
to
see
what
the
2010
version
tastes
like
or
will
i
age
it
jd
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
poured
a
very
thick
amber
brown
with
a
somewhat
tan
head
very
cloudy
liquid
with
a
continual
stream
of
small
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
which
keep
a
small
ring
of
foam
around
the
edge
of
my
glass
after
the
head
has
gone
smell
was
very
mild
and
nothing
i
noticed
about
it
stands
out
taste
was
almost
too
sweet
but
with
a
small
taste
of
hops
at
the
end
the
malts
didnt
stand
out
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
pleasantly
thicker
than
i
expected
and
fairly
smooth
over
all
a
decent
enough
beer
i
just
didnt
find
the
same
feel
other
posters
here
have
tastes
more
american
than
belgian
to
me
which
is
ok
i
agree
that
this
is
one
for
sipping
but
nothing
wrong
with
that
is
there
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
the
only
thing
that
wold
make
it
better
is
if
the
body
was
fuller
but
its
still
worth
a
try
sometime
my
favorite
of
goose
islands
belgium
beers
but
not
a
beer
ill
buy
every
year
i
have
one
me
bottle
ill
save
for
the
5
year
mark
and
maybe
ill
pick
a
few
more
up
then
good
stuff
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
like
me
and
want
a
spin
on
a
style
youre
not
a
huge
fan
of
without
a
doubt
improving
with
age
d
this
is
a
solid
brew
one
i
would
certainly
recommend
i
have
always
had
respect
for
gi
but
go
to
their
website
and
check
out
the
video
about
this
brew
itll
give
you
a
whole
new
perspective
about
both
this
brew
and
the
brewery
i
just
opened
a
bottle
dated
3808
with
the
same
labeling
at
the
sample
picture
it
poured
satiny
smooth
with
no
head
at
all
and
a
rich
cloudy
dark
amber
it
featured
a
massive
amount
of
sediment
which
didnt
take
away
at
all
the
smell
was
subtle
and
of
candied
fruit
and
slightly
sweet
with
slight
alcohol
aromas
the
taste
was
exceptional
it
was
both
yeasty
and
sweet
somewhat
like
candied
fruit
the
mouthfeel
was
extremely
smooth
with
little
carbonation
and
had
a
medium
body
the
aging
definitely
smoothed
this
one
out
quite
a
bit
this
was
exceptional
at
almost
2
12
years
old
the
pere
jacques
is
a
top
notch
belgian
dubbel
2010
bottle
pours
a
caramel
brown
with
hints
of
dark
amber
and
an
offwhite
head
nose
has
some
holiday
cake
aromas
that
lead
me
to
anticipate
something
sweet
with
dessert
spices
on
the
palate
theres
a
toffeebready
sweetness
up
front
along
with
some
of
those
holiday
spices
i
was
anticipating
medium
body
and
modest
carbonation
lead
to
a
sweet
finish
that
has
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
the
pour
is
a
caramelamber
color
with
a
very
slight
head
perhaps
using
caramel
as
a
color
descriptor
is
a
product
of
the
smell
which
is
rich
in
caramel
and
dried
dark
fruits
the
figs
and
raisins
really
show
themselves
in
the
taste
along
with
vanilla
and
again
a
touch
of
caramel
its
really
malty
and
sweet
i
was
hoping
for
a
hint
of
banana
or
some
bubblegum
but
it
was
not
readily
apparent
felt
really
nice
with
some
decent
viscosity
id
like
to
get
another
bottle
to
have
sit
around
for
a
year
or
so
to
tame
the
booziness
but
this
is
the
only
one
ive
got
for
now
o
same
as
before
dont
drink
a
bunch
of
these
md
full
bodied
carbonation
is
low
very
drinkable
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
maybe
not
as
complex
as
you
might
expect
from
a
dubbel
but
very
good
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
and
produced
a
nice
fluffy
off
white
head
the
color
was
solid
brown
with
amberred
hues
when
held
to
the
light
the
scent
was
fruity
with
raisins
and
a
bit
of
apple
and
some
nice
direct
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
was
malty
and
rounded
with
just
a
bit
of
toastiness
and
deep
fruity
plumraisin
flavors
a
little
bit
of
a
crackle
of
spice
is
evident
as
well
the
carbonation
is
lively
spirited
and
the
beer
finishes
just
ever
so
slightly
dry
and
a
medium
body
a
pretty
competent
version
of
a
dubbel
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
real
sense
d
this
is
a
deep
brew
very
layered
and
complex
i
love
the
way
it
paired
with
these
cheeses
and
was
just
a
lovely
drink
d
decent
but
it
is
pricey
and
did
not
strike
me
as
anything
special
for
the
price
ill
try
it
again
if
i
ever
run
across
it
in
the
hopes
that
i
got
an
off
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
brown
color
with
a
restrained
head
that
gives
off
nice
lacing
as
it
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
delicious
dark
fruits
figs
cherries
soaked
in
bourbon
ameretto
cookies
and
biscotti
comes
through
burnt
caramel
and
raisins
too
taste
is
very
good
has
a
lot
of
booze
on
the
backend
but
asked
a
bit
by
the
quality
of
the
dark
stone
fruits
semi
dry
finish
but
has
a
sticky
sweet
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
high
in
carbonation
i
would
like
to
see
this
a
touch
less
carbonated
also
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
for
me
though
the
flavors
are
still
there
drinkability
is
decent
as
well
because
its
delicious
but
the
thinness
of
this
is
just
not
appealing
still
great
and
would
reccomendstions
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
little
head
nose
is
bready
with
dark
fruit
and
hints
of
vanilla
taste
is
dominated
by
dark
fruits
and
vanilla
rum
just
enough
hops
there
to
keep
the
sweetness
at
bay
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
viscosity
and
smoothness
would
love
to
have
a
bit
more
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
style
glad
to
have
tried
and
would
sample
again
if
the
opportunity
arises
picked
up
a
12
oz
bottle
from
princeton
liquors
labeled
2010
in
the
light
its
a
beautiful
ruby
red
with
a
dash
of
amber
the
aroma
smells
of
caramel
syrup
and
dates
with
a
hint
of
rum
that
same
juicy
flavor
continues
but
theres
no
syrupy
feel
this
belgian
is
light
and
drinkable
for
the
style
without
being
too
thin
it
also
hold
hints
of
clove
and
vanilla
under
the
date
and
rum
raisin
tastes
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
check
it
out
if
you
dig
dark
belgians
even
though
this
ale
is
a
healthy
eight
percent
alcohol
i
was
surprised
at
the
heat
following
its
smooth
mouthfeel
i
also
found
the
pere
jacques
to
be
lightly
carbonated
for
this
style
as
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
champagne
feel
but
neither
of
these
factors
adversely
impacted
this
very
enjoyable
brew
by
this
time
i
should
have
known
to
expect
the
unexpected
from
goose
island
they
havent
yet
let
me
down
if
you
are
in
the
distribution
area
for
this
beer
it
may
be
the
best
american
example
of
the
style
balanced
with
a
deep
malty
nose
spicy
and
smooth
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
pillars
of
this
style
flows
across
a
bit
flat
and
unexciting
full
bodied
and
rich
with
a
sold
drinkability
if
you
were
held
to
the
american
side
for
dubbels
this
would
be
a
solid
choice
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
from
belgium
of
course
overallsolid
solid
dubbel
unique
doesnt
knock
it
out
of
the
park
for
me
but
i
enjoyed
it
worth
a
try
drinkability
its
a
sipper
but
a
good
one
lets
just
say
belgian
doppelbock
shall
we
given
that
i
can
buy
chimay
red
at
this
price
all
day
long
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
d
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
easy
sipper
for
the
abv
also
the
flavors
are
all
very
pleasant
and
are
blended
nicely
i
will
buy
more
of
these
to
age
and
see
how
they
develop
with
time
a
very
rich
and
drinkable
dubbel
december
2011
and
it
was
still
thick
and
rich
dark
and
sweet
certainly
had
not
lost
anything
though
i
am
not
certain
if
it
improved
either
not
disappointed
recommended
d
very
drinkable
each
sip
is
very
enjoyable
as
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
to
explore
in
this
beer
i
would
recommend
aging
this
one
as
i
tried
a
2007
pere
jacques
recently
which
was
phenomenal
i
hope
this
one
ages
just
as
well
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
is
not
that
complex
and
too
phenolic
there
a
bunch
of
dubbels
out
there
that
i
would
buy
before
this
one
this
is
a
great
beer
i
appreciate
drizzams
hospitality
tonight
with
this
offering
i
have
a
bottle
im
cellararing
i
plan
to
drink
it
in
the
year
2014
ill
be
sure
to
invite
drizzam
d
between
the
heat
and
the
syrupy
feel
its
a
definite
sipper
id
be
curious
to
try
it
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
but
there
are
better
dubbels
for
the
money
d
this
was
actually
a
very
tastey
dubbel
but
im
really
glad
that
i
had
it
fresh
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
a
whole
lot
and
will
definitely
try
to
get
more
d
very
drinkable
considering
the
alcohol
content
due
to
the
light
carbonation
its
syrupy
goodness
chock
full
of
sweet
malt
drinking
this
while
i
eat
a
steak
goes
great
with
it
d
pretty
easy
going
and
fun
to
drink
i
havent
had
too
many
beers
of
this
style
but
it
is
tasty
d
a
little
cloying
but
nice
second
time
i
tried
this
and
its
scored
improved
d
this
is
true
to
style
but
something
seems
to
be
missing
i
like
it
but
dont
love
it
it
is
an
excellent
way
to
finish
off
a
night
good
afterdinner
drink
i
am
not
sure
i
would
reach
for
another
immediately
following
this
one
but
i
will
definitely
have
another
one
in
the
future
worth
seeking
out
d
the
boozy
nature
of
this
beer
makes
this
one
a
little
hard
to
put
down
but
still
drinkable
i
feel
like
this
could
become
better
with
some
age
on
it
its
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
really
drinkable
for
me
i
crave
a
dry
finish
in
my
belgian
styles
and
this
is
the
opposite
of
that
i
feel
like
the
fg
is
way
too
high
and
i
have
been
rather
disappointed
with
the
entire
line
of
belgian
style
beers
goose
island
has
done
their
yeast
choice
is
likely
to
blame
edit
going
back
to
this
i
see
that
goose
island
themselves
call
this
beer
a
dubbel
only
the
abv
differentiates
this
and
a
great
quad
d
a
little
disappointed
following
the
sofie
with
this
both
are
belgians
from
gi
but
pere
jacques
seems
a
little
amateurish
smell
is
faint
and
flavor
is
not
as
balanced
looks
great
and
comes
in
a
classy
bottle
now
has
a
different
label
in
the
style
of
sofie
however
at
7
50
a
bottle
i
expect
better
okay
for
a
dubbel
but
more
on
the
belgium
strong
ale
side
for
me
d
goes
down
ok
definite
kick
to
this
beer
sits
somewhat
heavy
in
the
stomach
and
a
touch
too
sweet
its
an
ok
dubble
but
not
one
that
i
would
have
again
t
very
fruity
acidic
has
a
ciderish
aftertaste
well
carbonated
appley
in
the
the
beginning
has
a
slight
hop
ipa
taste
mixed
with
cider
sweet
but
crisp
flavor
is
fairly
well
balanced
but
its
lacking
both
in
malt
character
and
doesnt
compensate
with
fruit
esters
instead
the
off
notes
carry
the
day
its
as
undercarbonated
on
the
palate
as
it
looks
in
the
glass
and
overall
this
is
just
a
very
disappointing
beer
hopefully
just
a
bad
batch
overall
very
impressed
with
the
nose
and
flavors
present
interested
to
try
this
out
of
a
bottle
to
see
how
it
compares
to
the
draft
version
a
well
made
dubbel
me
thinks
d
this
is
a
fairly
good
attempt
at
the
dubbel
stlye
it
hits
most
of
the
marks
deadon
but
there
is
a
long
way
to
go
if
they
are
targeting
the
legendary
brews
offered
by
the
trappists
this
is
worth
a
shot
but
i
would
like
to
see
the
price
come
down
a
bit
for
the
quality
that
is
offered
for
a
buck
more
i
could
get
some
superior
offerings
from
belgium
2009
vintage
tasted
from
a
22oz
bottle
pours
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
nose
of
caramel
malt
raisins
brown
sugar
and
some
cherry
the
flavors
are
a
little
more
reserved
than
expected
but
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
some
banana
the
palate
is
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
medium
finish
that
is
sweet
the
alcohol
is
a
little
hotter
and
out
of
balance
than
i
would
like
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
poured
this
from
a
22oz
labeled
2010
it
poured
out
almost
like
a
translucent
red
wine
not
much
of
a
head
and
no
lace
on
the
first
sniff
i
get
fruit
cherry
mainly
candy
sugar
and
alcohol
it
smells
a
bit
like
cough
syrup
though
a
bit
more
natural
it
tastes
a
bit
better
than
it
smells
but
there
is
still
a
medicinal
quality
to
it
that
i
cant
ignore
it
goes
down
alright
but
the
taste
gets
in
the
way
i
love
beers
in
this
style
and
this
one
just
didnt
seem
to
fit
on
my
i
really
like

this
was
a
weird
beer
i
could
not
tell
if
it
was
a
dubbel
or
just
a
weird
belgian
strong
ale
it
smelled
yeasty
but
the
flavor
had
citrus
and
spice
like
a
tripel
but
then
also
raisin
like
flavors
that
i
get
from
dubbels
and
belgian

it
was

cover
of

is
a
perfume
like
white

sweet

and
some
other
dark
fruits
emerge
as
well
with
some
sweet
honey
like

i
taste
a
light
glazed

flavor
with
a
maple
sugar
glaze
like
a
vermont
pastry
some
woody
yeast
flavors
with
an

aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
nowhere
near
a

but
it
does
the
job
lacks
the
silky
smoothness
in

dubbels
some
mild
carbonation
with
continuous
bubbles
rising
interesting
attempt
at
a
dubbel
from
goose

but
the
american
flavor
is
there
definitely
try
this
one
and
see
how
it
puts
up
against
the
true
belgians

ive
only
had
a
couple
of
dubble
style
beers
and
this
so
far
has
been
my
favorite
deep
dark
color
with
a
fruit
and
caramel
aromas
the
taste
is
consistent
witht
he
aromas
i
even
tasted
a
hint
of
banana
and
chocolate
a
very
pleasent
experience
overall
and
this
beer
keeps
me
interested
in
pursuing
other
dubbels
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
warm
alcohol
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
as
well
as
fruity
yeast
esters
it
smells
of
figs
and
dates
it
appears
quite
dry
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
very
warm
crystal
malt
flavor
its
full
of
fruits
and
yeasty
esters
this
is
just
a
little
too
much
alcohol
flavor
for
me
its
right
there
no
hiding
it
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
got
excellent
yeast
character
but
its
way
too
bold
with
alcohol
it
needs
more
specialty
malts
this
may
not
be
the
best
dubbel
available
but
is
up
there
with
other
american
made
dubbels
i
will
try
and
age
my
last
bottle
and
see
how
it
ages
this
was
almost
a
year
old
and
i
will
try
and
get
some
of
the
07
version
to
age
with
it
lacking
complexity
and
depth
and
being
a
veritable
candycane
beer
the
only
thing
going
for
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
here
is
that
there¬ís
alcohol
contained
within
letdown
mdlow
carb
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
complex
well
rounded
and
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
i
found
it
way
to
easy
to
drink
for
something
so
high
in
alcohol
i
could
not
drink
many
of
these
but
then
dubbels
are
not
exactly
session
beers
that
said
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
dubbel
distinctiveness
is
one
of
the
most
important
criteria
for
me
and
theres
nothing
else
quite
like
pere
jacques
at
least
nothing
fresh
i
e
brewed
in
the
u
s
it
pours
a
deep
amber
with
more
than
a
little
gold
tinge
not
much
head
not
a
problem
for
a
sipping
beer
in
my
opinion
the
aroma
is
molassesy
malt
with
the
alcohol
coming
through
nicely
it
has
a
big
sweet
fruity
malt
taste
complex
and
bordering
on
decadent
its
reminiscent
of
a
cross
between
a
belgian
golden
ale
and
an
old
ale
or
some
other
malty
style
it
has
an
almost
perfect
degree
of
alcohol
warming
it
finishes
just
a
little
sticky
with
little
evidence
of
hops
incredibly
satisfying
without
being
filling
drinkability
probably
the
most
sweetness
i
have
gotten
out
of
a
dubbel
before
9
abv
seems
a
bit
on
the
higher
side
for
a
dubbel
though
drinkability
the
9
abv
is
well
hidden
a
real
nice
drinker
pere
jacques
held
up
well
after
two
years
im
impressed
pours
a
cloudy
brown
some
orange
highlights
thick
off
white
head
nice
lacing
good
retention
smell
is
sweet
candi
bubblegum
citrus
bread
little
bit
of
white
wine
nice
taste
is
sweet
candi
bubblegum
again
some
banana
very
fruity
in
the
finish
touch
of
alcohol
light
spice
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
but
has
an
almost
rough
residual
sweetness
that
kills
the
finish
for
me
still
a
nice
example
of
a
dubbel
color
is
a
dark
orangetinged
amber
substantially
hazed
by
particulate
capped
by
a
good
amount
of
thick
tan
head
with
decent
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
were
good
right
after
the
pour
but
really
opened
up
shortly
after
the
substantial
malts
and
alcohol
in
the
nose
soon
share
the
air
with
surprisingly
delicate
fruit
and
spice
notes
the
taste
is
likewisea
sturdy
malt
backbone
complemented
by
alcohol
warmth
spice
hops
and
again
the
unexpectedly
delicate
fruit
notes
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
substantial
as
well
without
being
too
clingy
what
started
out
as
a
decent
beer
ended
up
being
a
welcome
surprise
the
aroma
was
a
bit
sour
woodycardboardish
and
a
bit
like
goodbeergonebad
however
undaunted
i
took
a
sip
and
was
quite
surprised
the
beer
is
quite
spicy
up
front
with
a
warm
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
stickiness
and
alcohol
esters
up
front
this
beer
was
served
in
a
longstemmed
glass
looked
like
a
wine
or
martini
glass
and
it
definitely
drank
more
like
a
really
nice
spirit
than
a
beer
mouthfeel
was
quite
smooth
like
a
beer
that
has
been
secondary
fermented
dont
know
if
it
has
or
not
to
me
goose
island
beers
are
a
bit
hitmiss
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
that
is
hampered
by
just
a
little
too
much
booze
i
think
a
year
in
the
bottle
would
do
quite
a
bit
for
it
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
14
beige
head
over
the
lightly
cloudy
dull
burgundy
brew
head
falls
to
a
layer
of
swirly
bubbles
pretty
quick
with
an
admirable
lace
presence
aroma
is
lightly
spicy
over
the
sweetness
with
some
grassiness
taste
starts
with
a
touch
of
citrus
quickly
giving
way
to
the
malt
sweetness
close
finds
the
vegetal
again
along
with
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
alright
but
this
just
needs
bit
more
zing
to
make
it
worth
my
trouble
to
find
pours
a
dark
honey
color
with
a
medium
head
smells
is
dominated
by
fruit
smells
very
similiar
to
some
of
the
great
belgians
ive
had
in
the
past
taste
is
awesome
again
fruity
but
with
a
alcohol
presense
that
is
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
i
can
tell
i
am
drinking
this
too
cold
cause
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
full
bodied
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
great
gi
makes
alot
of
great
beers
but
this
is
something
i
didnt
know
they
were
capable
of
doing
well
done
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
easy
to
quaff
beyond
the
higher
alcohol
content
if
you
see
an
aged
bottle
of
this
pick
some
up
overall
an
enjoyable
americanbrewed
belgian
style
the
9
alcohol
is
on
the
high
end
for
a
dubbel
but
it
fits
in
seamlessly
with
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
remarkably
smooth
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
good
balanced
interesting
and
enjoyable
all
around
a
pleasing
beer
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
pours
a
three
finger

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
ia
im
torn
as
i
know
this
bottle
may
have
just
been
bad
since
i
dont
remember
the
sharp
alcohol
characteristic
when
i
drank
the
first
three
bottles
a
couple
months
ago
however
given
the
price
on
this
one
ill
probably
skip
it
if
i
see
it
again
overall
a
very
good
beer
very
similar
to
letrappekoenigshoeven
quadrupel
same
yeast
perhaps
interesting
enough
for
me
as
i
do
like
the
style
however
not
anything
too
fantastic
for
me
to
seek
this
out
thanks
wadsey
for
the
chance
to
revisit
as
above
but
i
appreciate
more
balance
here
soft
and
smooth
the
sweetness
balanced
perfectly
by
just
enough
bitterness
i
dont
know
it
the
bottle
brew
or
my
palate
changed
but
i
have
adjusted
my
ratings
and
like
it
more
pours
a
cloudy
brownishamber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tannish
head
which
stuck
around
for
a
little
while
some
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
alcohol
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweetmalty
with
a
warming
effect
and
a
dry
caramel
finish
medium
body
drinkable
a
very
nice
brew
from
gi
but
not
really
a
dubbel
in
my
book
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
brown
sugar
and
sweet
malt
mixing
with
general
fruitiness
i
also
get
a
bit
of
cloves
mixed
in
the
background
very
smooth
and
super
easy
to
drink
with
no
hint
of
the
abv
a
tasty
brew
for
sure
that
i
would
enjoy
drinking
again
d¬óit¬ís
good
i¬íd
have
it
again
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
upon
initially
hitting
the
tongue
this
seems
like
it
will
be
one
of
those
thick
syrupy
beers
however
relative
to
the
style
this
is
fairly
light
in
fact
the
mouthfeel
may
be
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
evaporates
off
the
palate
just
leaving
the
aftertaste
behind
really
special
in
this
regard
dubbel
usually
arent
your
overlydrinkable
style
but
i
find
this
one
to
be
easy
to
take
really
good
d
quite
drinkable
its
9
abv
but
the
alcohol
is
as
well
hidden
as
its
belgian
counterparts
this
years
batch
seems
to
taste
better
than
last
years
last
years
seemed
much
sweeter
than
this
possibly
due
to
my
evolving
palate
a
noble
effort
bring
on
the
2007
version
mouthfeel
is
fine
even
with
low
carbonation
feels
full
in
the
mouth
but
light
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
have
multiples
of
in
a
row
high
alcohol
controls
pace
it
has
a
nice
deep
red
color
or
dark
cloudy
brownish
color
small
head
with
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
it
almost
looked
like
wine
by
the
time
it
reached
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
sweet
of
caramel
malts
and
some
alcohol
it
tastes
sweet
of
malt
in
the
front
and
finishes
with
some
yeast
and
hints
of
the
alcohol
low
in
carbonation
also
this
is
a
descent
brew
but
nothing
exciting
the
story
on
the
label
is
very
interesting
its
always
interesting
where
brewers
come
up
with
the
names
for
their
creations
the
alcohol
content
is
a
bit
much
to
have
this
as
a
session
beer
but
it
is
still
a
nice
drink
pours
a
muddy
medium
brown
with
a
fast
attenuating
tan
head
carbonation
is
coarse
some
citric
esters
in
aroma
light
carbonation
on
the
tongue
with
mild
citrus
and
caramel
with
almost
no
hop
finish
nice
assertive
malt
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
extremely
good
for
this
abv
definitely
not
to
style
as
a
dubbel
maybe
it
should
be
slotted
as
a
dark
strong
poured
out
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
a
very
thin
off
white
head
decent
lacing
the
nose
offered
lots
of
yeast
ripe
fruit
and
caramel
the
tastes
was
just
like
the
nose
malty
sweetness
with
notes
of
banana
rum
brown
sugar
and
fresh
bread
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
fine
bubbles
nicely
balanced
but
a
bit
cloying
and
harsh
with
the
alcohol
bottle
courtesy
of
tpaliga
poured
a
cloudy
deep
brown

ale
with
a
medium
dirty
white
foamy
head

big
strong

and
subtle
yeast
characteristic
can
be
detected
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
lots
of
candi
sugar
and
some
dry
figs
characteristics
body
was
definitely
fuller
then
average
with
some
well
concealed
alcohol
very
reminiscent
of
gouden
carolus
keizer
though
probably
not
as
complex
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
beer
nothing
was
terrible
about
it
it
just
wasnt
interesting
at
all
for
me
the
smooth
taste
was
slightly
hindered
by
the
sweetness
which
was
a
helpful
pointer
on
other
qualities
of
the
ale
i
thought
about
fruit
flavors
and
how
this
ale
would
taste
great
with
a
sweet
and
sour
pork
very
little
head
nice
lacing
color
is
dirtclay
brown
and
cloudy
smells
malty
and

like
overripe

watermelon
cloves
pretty

nose
taste
is

and
sweet
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overbearing
cloves
and
red
fruits
abound
sweeter
take
on
a
dubbel
than
im
used
to
i
like
it
but
im
not
blown
away
smooth
and
well
balanced
sticky
easy
to
drink
at
first
but
harder
ass
it
warms
a
bit
and
almost
becomes
too
sweet
and
sticky
poured
into
chalice
a
musty
deep
reddish
brown
its
got
decent
retention
and
tiny
bubbles
the
head
dissipates
fast
and
lingers
around
bottom
but
with
a
dubbel
i
never
really
expect
too
much
head
any
way
so
thats
fine
smells
of
sweet
malt
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
there
is
tinge
of
wine
or
port
like
smells
to
the
nose
with
some
nice
dark
fruity
esters
definitely
the
sort
of
musty
malty
smell
of
a
dubbel
tastes
of
both
sweet
and
toasted
malt
with
apple
and
plum
esters
maybe
even
a
tinge
of
anise
the
hop
character
here
is
extremely
minimal
which
is
what
id
expect
with
a
belgian
style
dubbel
the
longer
i
sit
with
this
beer
the
more
i
like
it
for
me
its
not
the
immediate
gratification
of
one

their

in
the
back
of
the
brew
really
if
they
just
coreected
the
finish
it
lacks
the

zing
of
some
of
its

it
also
doesnt
look
as
pretty
as

when
served
in

missed
the

but
had
a
chance
to
try
the
2010
it
has
mellowed
a
lot
over
the
iterations
and
i
noticed
that
the
abv
went
down
from
9
0
to
8
0
it
lost
a
lot
of
the
harsh
character
that
i
noted
five
years
ago
which
is
great
although
i
though
this
years
effort
lacked
proper
carbonation
for
the
style
all
in

still
a
very

lacking

though
benign
and
mostly
nonoffensive
couldve
just
been
that
the
bottle
was
past
its
prime
but
i
dont
see
why
a
beer
like
this
couldnt
hold
up
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
pretty
average
overall
not
very
tasty
but
not
undrinkable
overall
a
very
good
dubbel
that
stands
up
to
the
belgian
originals
overall
an
interesting
dubbel
i
prefer
it
to
your
overcaramel
or
overbiscuity
dubbels
but
the
alcoholic
and
phenolic
characters
are
just
a
little
bit
overcharged
overall
a
nice
brew
i
actually
enjoyed
the
sourfunk
but
not
very
representative
of
what
we
all
know
as
a
dubbel
im
thinking
this
is
most
likley
what
a
dubbel
used
to
taste
like
centuries
ago
although
it
pains
me
to
say
this
but
its
a
good
brew
goes
well
with
garlic
olives
for
no
particular
reason
o
ive
heard
some
good
things
about
this
one
and
ive
heard
some
bad
however
im
throwing
all
that
shit
out
the
window
by
saying
i
dig
it
and
will
stand
by
that
overall
i
really
did
not
like
this
too
much
yeast
induced
spiciness
and
yeasty
esters
overpowering
the
fruity
date
malt
profile
o
an
interesting
and
unique
dubbel
not
bad
by
any
means
though
a
little
unusual
for
the
style
o
kind
of
a
let
down
appearance
wise
it
looks
excellent
and
the
aroma
was
rather
impressive
for
an
american
brewed
dubbel
but
the
flavors
and
mouth
feel
just
fell
flat
watery
thin
unbalanced
flavors
and
a
harsh
aftertaste
the
pour
is
amber
in
color
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
heavy
on
the
grape
very
vinous
and
fruit
with
some
sweet
toffee
and
bready
malt
the
flavor
is
perhaps
even
moreso
than
the
aroma
this
also
has
a
touch
of
lactic
tartness
which
i
think
is
probably
unintentional
not
really
all
that
dubbellike
onot
sure
if
the
funk
is
suppose
to
be
there
but
the
mesh
of
flavors
isnt
where
it
should
be
an
easy
and
unexpected
beer
given
the
flavor
combination
while
i
am
not
sure
this
fits
the
dubbel
style
it
was
well
enjoyed
while
watching
the
super
bowl
if
this
were
a
sour
style
id
rate
this
much
higher
as
it
is
the
look
and
feel
are
the
only
reason
the
crack
the
bottle
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
a
winner
in
the
dubbel
category
missing
the
characteristic
depth
dark
candi
sugars
and
yeasty
roundness
captain

st

pours
a
very
dark
and
deep
purple
with
very
faint
ruby
highlights
theres
about
a
finger
of
tan
foam
sitting
atop
the
beer
and
its
dissipation
is
a
slow
one
lacing
is
essentially
nonexistent
though
the
nose
is
surprisingly
buttery
there
are
some
plum
and
clove
present
but
they
are
by
far
secondary
aromas
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
same
if
anything
theres
more
of
a
buttery
toffee
presence
than
in
the
nose
it
tastes
like
a
bunch
of
english
brown
ale
got
poured
into
my
dubbel
once
again
the
dark
fruit
and
spicy
phenol
notes
can
be
found
but
they
are
a
bit
tough
to
appreciate
underneath
all
the
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
rich
but
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
bubbly
its
not
that
i
didnt
enjoy
what
was
in
my
glass
its
just
that
i
ordered
a
beer
called
st

and
what
i
got
isnt
much
of
a
dubbel

up

near
the

a

adds
a
different
aspect
to
this
with
lingering
notes
of
chocolate

spices

finish
is
excellent
not
too
dry
leaving
a

for

and

with
a

and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
definitely
an
outstanding
dubbel
with
tons

flavor
and

improved
a

a

american
dubbel
o
this
is
a
great
beer
but
not
very
close
to
style
maybe
a
little
closer
to
a
flanders
oud
bruin
drank
too
cold
this
beer
will
not
come
off
as
malty
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
loves
belgians
not
much
more
i
can
add
to
it
very
good
among
the
better
dubbels
in
my
opinion
overall
a
great
complex
brew
will
have
to
check
out
more
of
the
captain
larry
for
sure
seems
like
realy
craft
brews
for
sure
a
pretty
tasty
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
with
dark
fruit
and
caramel
coming
out
as
it
fades
worth
a
try
as
i
need
to
have
this
again
to
get
a
better
feel
for
it
and
really
appreciate
this
creation
a
decent
stylized
take
on
the
style
would
buy
this
again
if
available
overall
it
drinks
nicely
but
seems
a
bit
off
for
the
style
a
person
who
likes
dubbels
may
enjoy
this
or
they
may
feel
it
misses
for
style
i
enjoyed
it
but
not
enough
to
buy
a
bottle
has
elements
of
an
old
ale
in
addition
to
a
dubbel
which
makes
this
an
unusual
and
some
will
say
unpleasant
example
of
the
style
one
that
doesnt
stand
up
to
its
belgian
predecessors
d
capt
lawrence
was
due
for
a
dissapointment
i
loved
their
noreaster
5
year
and
extra
gold
but
this
one
is
not
so
good
im
visiting
this
brewery
soon
enough
and
will
try
this
beer
again
im
wondering
if
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
the
palate
is
a
bit
of
a
strange
beast
opening
fruity
tart
and
vinous
theres
a
suggestion
of
an
accidental
inoculation
of
souring
culture
with
a
blend
of
lactic
sourness
and
a
very
earthy
leathery
brett
character
this
renders
the
fruity
and
the
malt
character
secondary
but
it
also
does
help
in
drying
this
beer
out
theres
a
definite
plum
character
as
well
as
a
blend
of
spices
with
anise
and
a
little
black
cardamom
theres
also
a
very
nice
flavor
of
toffee
cocoa
and
burnt
sugar
drying
and
tart
with
a
little
bit
of
leather
and
spice
on
the
finish
this
is
quite
enjoyable
light
in
body
and
excessively
carbonated
this
is
highly
unusual
for
the
style
but
still
very
enjoyable
as
a
beer
especially
when
colder
as
it
warms
up
it
does
grow
increasingly
disjointed
but
i
am
going
easy
on
my
scores
here
overall
i
love
this
offering
from
the
cpt
they
have
yet
to
let
me
down
even
with
a
little
higher
price
i
will
continue
to
buy
this
and
age
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
thanks
to
shogokawada
for
this
gem
body
is
fairly
full
with
low
to
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
was
on
the
low
end
of
the
spectrum
for
me
i
just
couldnt
get
past
that
strange
sour
flavor
i
would
like
to
try
one
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
those
flavors
are
still
there
perhaps
this
was
a
bad
bottle
i
had
it
once
before
and
dont
remember
the
extreme
sourness
i
had
in
this
bottle
in
addition
captain
lawrence
usually
nails
their
beers
this
is
off
target
poured

appearance

with
a

and
some

power
nose
is

fruits
toast
and
a
bit
of
spicing
the
flavor
is
malty
with
some
dark
drugs
and
yeast
good
body
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
heat
drinkability
is
good
though
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
complexity
d
slightly
above
average
but
would
not
recommend
it
edit
it
tastes
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
with
the
yeast
mixed
in
but
the
bottle
didnt
state
to
do
that
so
the
scores
stand
all
that
being
said
it
is
a
fairly
drinkable
dubbel
its
just
on
the
lighter
more
simple
side
of
the
spectrum
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
a
very
nice
dubbel
with
some
very
good
malty
flavors
to
it
along
with
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
very
nice
beer
overall
to
enjoy
on
this
sunday
afternoon
full
bodied
with
a
lot
of
dark
roasted
maltiness
balanced
by
some
plumraisin
dark
fruit
notes
chocolate
spicy
and
alcohol
heat
nice
balance
of
sweetness
from
the
dark
fruit
and
dry
finish
pretty
drinkable
d
its
not
as
drinkable
compared
to
other
dubbels
given
the
amount
of
hop
flavors
you
really
need
to
warm
this
beer
up
d
probably
would
be
much
better
if
there
wasnt
so
much
sediment
but
it
was
still
a
gentle
pour
showed
some
promise
though
d
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
noticeable
after
the
halfglass
and
unfortunately
the
sediment
offsets
the
rest
of
the
dubbel
being
good
its
still
got
potential
and
decent
drinkability
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
large
head
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
legs
the
nose
is
mostly
malt
with
some
sweetness
and
yeast
slightly
metallic
mostly
malty
with
a
little
fruit
and
even
less
spicy
yeast
mouthfeel
and
body
are
fine
not
overly
impressed
above
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
decent
but
not
one
of
captain
lawrences
better
offerings
at
least
it
wasnt
infected
though
d
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
with
a
hoppy
undertone
i
prefer
darker
dubbels
but
this
would
be
great
for
a
fan
of
the
hoppier
beers
full
body
on
this
and
carries
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
as
most
belgian
styles
do
flavors
of
roasted
apples
other
dark
fruits
and
rounded
out
with
a
slight
yeasty
twang
on
the
finish
this
was
a
pretty
good
dubbel
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
a
treat
a
thick
frothy
head
that
is
dropping
precipitously
to
leave
a
rocky
layer
on
top
the
color
is
primarily
an
opaque
brown
with
a
hint
of
ruby
what
appears
to
be
decent
lacing
along
the
edge

it
but
it
just
did
not
seem
to
hold
up
well
for
me
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
brewery
and
this
is
really
the
only
thing
i
have
no
liked
split
the
bottle
and
it
was
plenty
for
both
of
us
pours
an
orangish
brown
with
a
silky
tan
head
nose
has
figs
plums
cherries
toffee
bready
malts
cloves
and
peppery
yeast
taste
is
not
quite
as
nutty
and
earthy
as
i
like
to
see
mostly
ripe
pitted
fruitsfollowed
dark
candy
cocoa
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
medium
body
is
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
settles
down
nicely
as
this
opens
up
another
fine
ale
from
captain
lawrence
a
pretty
straight
forward
and
enjoyable
dubbel
this
is
probably
the
best
version
of
svd
to
date
still
it
cant
hold
a
candle
to
the
trappists
but
its
leaning
in
a
more
traditional
and
even
handed
direction
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
enjoyable
thanks
to
romanw70
for
bringing
this
one
to
the
sunday
night
tasting
poured
a
hazycloudy
caramel
with
a
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
slick
nose
reveals
hops
nutmeg
coriander
and
a
peppery
quality
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
some
chocolate
prunes
and
an
earthy
quality
comes
out
with
hops
bittering
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
fizzyprickly
too
much
carbonation
on
this
one
really
nice
complexity
in
this
beer
definitely
improves
as
the
carbonation
levels
subside
and
the
brew
warms
d
i
drank
the
two
snifter
glasses
in
no
time
at
all
the
alcohol
got
to
be
a
bit
much
during
the
second
glass
with
the
increased
warming
but
the
dark
fruit
action
also
increased
putting
a
smile
on
my
face
this
was
my
1st
time
with
this
brew
and
i
think
two
years
in
the
bottle
will
do
this
dubbel
justice
even
though
its
real
nice
right
now
for
a
style
i
dont
actively
seek
out
this
one
is
worth
repeat
purchases
thanks
to
my
wife
for
bringing
a
bottle
home
from
a
trip
the
beer
is
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
light
beige
head
that
recedes
slowly
slick
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
malt
ripe
fruit
and
yeast
with
some
spices
medium
body
with
flavors
of
malt
dark
fruit
and
yeast
along
with
some
hops
the
finish
is
smooth
and
fruity
with
a
mild
spice
and
yeast
aftertaste
pretty
good
overall
d
a
fantastic
beer
very
balanced
not
as
sweet
and
a
tad
drier
than
other
dubbels
but
it
made
up
for
it
in
many
other
ways
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
nice
puffy
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
nice
cap
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
candi
sugar
and
a
bit
metallic
or
rusty
from
the
dark
belgian
malt
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
belgian
candi
sugar
a
slightly
nutty
toasted
malt
and
some
raisinfig
fruitiness
everything
is
in
balance
one
of
the
better
dubbels
that
i
have
had
in
a
long
while
a
moderate
body
with
very
fizzy
carbonation
starts
off
sweet
but
actually
finishes
dry
one
of
the
better
dubbels
that
i
have
had
either
us
or
belgian

to
hit
the
style

some

notes
too
from
my
recollection
of
last
years
batch
this
doesnt
seem
as
complex
its
a
touch
sweet
and
weaker
in
the
palate
maybe
its
the
tap
vs
bottle
difference
i
dunno
but
im
not
loving
it
as
much
as
i
did
last
year
d
alcohol
is
detectable
in
the
taste
but
its
not
off
putting
there
is
not
much
after
taste
but
the
sweetness
and
stickiness
bring
down
the
drinkability
slightly
bug
spray
drinkability
as
someone
whos
definitely
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
quite
a
bit
the
part
that
i
hate
is
the
sweetness
and
somehow
this
brew
still
retains
its
dubbel
quality
just
an
all
around
enjoyable
beer
from
an
even
better
brewery
thanks
much

large
dense

resting
atop
a

malt
smell
with
the
definitive
belgian
yeast
providing
a
dark
fruit
hint
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
there
is
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
or
tartness
to
the
smell
this
carried
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
a
rich
caramel
sweetness
upfront
that
is
followed
by
that
tart
back
end
maybe
i
want
to
say
a
spicy
finish
to
it
because
the
alcohol
is
not
so
high
to
cause
that
sensation
in
my
mouth
a
bit
tart
as
it
rests
in
your
mouth
that
spiciness
i
guess
you
could
say
there
is
a
nice
warming
effect
as
you
enjoy
it
definitely
a
nice
sipping
beer
with
a
few
different
things
going
on
in
it
the
alcohol
may
be
a
little
too
apparent
for
my
taste
overall
a
tasty
brew
happy
to
have
tried
it
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
started
to
get
a
bit
cloying
by
the
end
still
a
decent
beer
drinkability
this
was
an
interesting
strange
brew
it
almost
tastes
like
it
was
bretted
though
that
cant
possibly
be
the
case
can
it
either
way
its
a
dry
quenching
spicy
fruity
dubbel
and
i
sort
of
kind
of
maybe
like
it
so
yes
im
gonna
recommend
it
though
be
wary
of
the
barnyarditude
m
d
moderate
carbonation
heavier
body
though
it
has
a
dryness
that
i
can
go
for
the
funk
flavours
a
re
a
little
much
for
me
i
thought
i
would
love
it
but
cant
say
i
do
quite
as
much
as
some
others
still
worth
trying
out
and
id
be
interested
in
more
theres
a
definite
dopplebock
characteristic
to
this
one
as
well
almost
like
a
dubbelbock
clean
where
it
should
be

there
should

medium
body
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
very
drinkable
i
like
this
one
di
love
belgians
but
the
dubbel
is
one
style
from
the
belgian
line
up
that
i
have
not
found
and
example
that
i
could
drink
over
and
over
again
this
is
that
example
this
is
an
excellent
dubbel
though
the
abv
is
a
bit
higher
than
expected
and
is
everything
that
i
find
good
in
that
brew
very
well
done
by
captain
lawrence
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
brews
from
this
great
brewing
co
the
body
is
moderate
a
bit
sweet
with
a
somewhat
under
attenuated
feel
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
for
style
but
ok
overall
a
little
disappointing
some
off
notes
and
big
phenolics
really
distract
this
is
a
top
notch
brew
and
a
great
surprise
because
i
usually
find
dubbels
to
be
so
uninspiring
loads
of
flavor
here
though
and
definitely
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
notes
from
112306
d
this
beer
has
nice
complexity
with
a
big
alcohol
heat
that
would
be
better
after
some
age
it
is
pretty
dry
for
a
double
but
has
big
good
malt
flavors
coming
through
which
is
a
nice
change
nice
pale
chocolate
looking
beer
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
on
top
moderate
amount
of
funk
and
yeast
in
the
aromadried
fruits
come
to
mind
good
solid
malty
flavor
with
a
decent
yeasty
and
fruity
flavor
to
go
with
ever
so
slight
spicyness
to
it
finish
is
rather
sweet
good
mouthfeel
very
good
beer
overallmy
first
from
captain
lawrencei
look
forward
to
more
dyet
another
nice
brew
from
the
captain
i
am
not
really
sure
why
i
sat
on
this
for
so
long
but
i
did
the
aging
might
have
done
it
well
as
it
most
likely
toned
down
the
alcohol
which
can
be
felt
yet
is
not
distracting
d
the
bottle
went
down
very
smooth
tried
this
one
recently
based
on
the
reviews
served
in
my
chimmay
chalice
unfortunately
it
just
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
i
was
hoping
to
find
a
home
brewed
capt
lawrence
is
about
15
miles
away
belgium
that
i
would
really
enjoy
but
i
was
disappointed
flavor
wise
it
was
close
but
something
was
missing
it
really
didnt
have
that
rich
deep
taste
a
true
belgim
dubbel
has
dhit
the
spot
if
it
werent
such
a
large
bottle
1
9l
it
would
be
very
drinkable
nonetheless
quality

got
some

up
in
here

is
full
nice
earthy

smooth
sweetness
and
a
nice
level
of
figs
and
matured
fruits
a
bit
hot
with
the
booze
but
it
doesnt
matter
so
much
nice
feel
and
nice
to
drink
a
pretty
tasty
american
version
of
a
belgian
style
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
dubbels
ive
had
so
far
even
though
you
can
taste
a
little
alcohol
thats
not
going
to
stop
you
from
drinking
an
entire
bottle
of
this
fine
brew
it
didnt
stop
me
another
winner
from
captain
lawrence
its
pricy
but
well
worth
every
cent
another
lovely
drinking
belgium
from
this
brewery
yeasty
and
malty
aroma
full
bannana
consistency
mouthfeel
sweet
whipped
up
maltinesscarmel
sugar
with
building
waves
of
moderate
bitterness
fruity
but
thats
only
a
hint
a
it
softer
carbonation
would
be
welcome
d
extremely
drinkable
and
i
think
it
would
be
even
moreso
with
some
age
on
it
another
good
one
from
cl
another
winner
from
captain
lawrence
very
nice
highly
recommended
d
this
ones
complex
meant
to
be
enjoyed
d
very
drinkable
but
it
took
me
quite
a
while
to
get
through
my
share
the
abv
is
low
by
big
beer
standards
but
the
flavor
is
right
up
there
i
love
when
breweries
can
get
this
massive
taste
out
of
lower
abv
beers
scott
has
struck
gold
again
maybe
it
was
the
year
this
bottle
had
on
it
but
it
really
surprised
me
at
how
good
it
was
as
a
side
note
one
thing
i
really
liked
about
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
as
it
warms
up
a
more
noticeable
smoky
flavor
becomes
gradually
apparent
d
a
borderline
good
dubbel
but
falls
short
in
some
aspects
per
style
and
when
compared
to
their
other
beers
st
vincents
dubbel
is
a
real
disappointment
from
captain
lawrence
everything
else
ive
sampled
from
them
has
been
top
notch
unfortunately
this
offering
falls
far
short
bottom
line
a
very
tasty
dubbel
that
grew
on
me
during
the
session
so
id
put
it
firmly
in
the
id
drink
it
again
category
very
tasty
and
drinkable
but
some
cocoa
notes
would
add
some
depth
drinkability
excellent
version
everyone
should
get
their
hands
on
easy
to
drink
and
more
than
one
bottle
can
be
consumed
in
a
session

medium

body
is
full
with
a
creamy
texture
and
some
pretty
good
carbonation
i
thought
this
was
a
bit
too
boozy
overall
to
really
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
thought
pours
a
dark
orange
rusty
amber
color
slightly
hazy
and
effervescent
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
resists
fading
solid
sheets
of
lacing
in
its
wake
an
aggressive
dark
fruit
and
sweet
earthy
aroma
highlighted
with
a
spicy
coriander
character
well
carbonated
the
tongue
immediately
becomes
preoccupied
with
a
spicy
tingle
and
sense
of
the
alcohol
for
me
most
of
the
flavor
was
sensed
in
the
back
and
with
the
swallow
and
finishing
breath
quite
a
bit
more
spicy
than
fruity
but
the
flavor
does
linger
well
giving
it
a
lot
to
consider
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
to
this
one
than
the
interlude
that
i
just
poured
out
rich
and
flavor
and
pretty
intense
this
is
a
nice
warming
sipping
brew
that
hits
the
style
well
enough
drinkability
i
usually
can
go
either
way
with
dubbels
but
i
cant
help
but
find
saint
vincents
dubbel
to
be
pretty
likeable
this
is
quite
tasty
it
has
quite
a
bit
more
darker
grain
notes
in
it
than
is
typical
especially
towards
the
finish
but
these
notes
mostly
add
another
dimension
to
this
brew
while
the
aroma
is
not
overly
so
the
flavor
definitely
has
some
heavy
spiciness
to
it
though
i
wouldnt
guess
this
is
anything
more
than
fermentation
character
fairly
rich
tasting
yet
the
overall
experience
of
this
beer
remains
surprisingly
light
either
dubbels
are
finally
beginning
to
grow
on
me
dubbels
have
been
one
of
the
few
belgian
styles
i
have
not
really
been
exited
about
or
this
is
just
enough
different
from
the
typical
example
that
i
am
really
enjoying
this
right
now
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
burnt
toffee
scent
along
with
a
light
yeast
fruitiness
its
warm
with
a
wonderful
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
sweet
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
roasted
and
caramel
malts
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
a
nice
warming
effect
there
is
a
mild
yeast
fruitiness
that
blends
well
with
the
crystal
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
delicious
beer
its
warm
and
malty
with
just
the
right
amount
of
yeast
esters
this
is
a
great
dubbel
the
best
american
dubbel
i
have
had
in
years
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
highly
recommended
not
bad
but
not
for
me
this
offering
from
captain
lawrence
pours
an
unfiltered
dark
brown
beauty
the
nose
is
dark
ripened
pitted
fruit
plums
raisins
prunes
with
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
followed
by
just
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
of
tart
unripened
fruit
as
suppose
to
citrus
to
help
balance
the
malty
sweetness
the
finish
is
a
bit
rough
at
8
it
is
not
too
hot
and
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
young
and
a
bit
raw
for
a
dubbel
i
think
age
would
do
this
dubbel
some
good
but
it
is
still
a
nice
sipper
i
should
note
that
the
bottle
cap
on
my
bottle
just
came
off
too
easy
and
that
i
would
have
preferred
a
cork
or
a
twist
off
for
securing
the
beer
side
note
my
wife
whose
favorite
beers
are
witbiers
and
weisbiers
made
a
this
is
disgusting
face
after
trying
it
poured
into
a
heavy
glass
chalice
formed
a
skim
of
beige
head
above
the
slightly
cloudy
brownish
burgundy
brew
head
is
quickly
down
to
just
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
with
limited
delicate

upfront

nicely
into

dark

in
the
middle
and
then
alcohol
warmth
turns
on
the
afterburners
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
a
little
lacking
the
carbonation
area
and
drinkability
is
somewhat
limited
by
the
alcohol
which
seems
to
feel
stronger
than
the
advertised
8abv
actually
had
a
little
bit
of
gum
numbness
going
for
a
bit
nonetheless
and
nice
brew
and
glad
i
got
to
enjoy
it
taste
carbonation
felt
a
little
too
lively
but
it
actually
worked
out
well
as
it
mingled
with
the
alcohol
that
tingled
my
face
all
the
way
to
my
nose
like
drinking
sparkling
wine
too
fast
solid
malt
presence
but
had
a
touch
of
ash
in
the
end
that
spoils
the
sweetness
in
the
end
still
a
good
beer
in
a
style
where
im
sort
of
hard
to
please
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
yeasty
with
cocoa
clinging
to
the
semidry
palate
as
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
hit
the
spot
very
very
nice
the
8
is
evident
but
also
enjoyed
interesting
warming
not
really
too
unlike
chimay
premiere
in
a
way
but
bigger
very
nice
this
is
the
latest
just
released
selection
from
the
captain
rum
overall
this
is
a
serviceable
brew
but
nothing
special
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
not
too
much
spice
still
tastes
like
beer
tasted
stale
like
old
bud
light
overall
nice
domestic
interpretation
of
a
dubbel
malty
and
roasted
flavors
were
smooth
and
enjoyable
very
easy
drinking
winter
ale
on
a
cold
evening
overall
a

may
or
may

great
beer
that
i
could
care

what
the
style
is
or
what
it
is
trying
to
be
its
just
a
great
beer
some
spicy
notes
but
not

overall
deep

of

actually
quite

taste
is
strong
up

with
malt
and
roasted
malt
also
a
little
alcohol
burn
as
it
settles
in
and
some
dry
spice
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
ok
carbonation
is
right
on
and
balance
is
good
great
look
and
smell
to
this
winter
ale
taste
is
a
little
buttery
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
hoppy
and
malty
dubbel
i
dont
normally
care
much
for
this
style
but
i
would
drink
this
again
somewhat
similar
to
a
dark
belgian
ale
nice
malt
mouthfeel
a
taste
of
dried
raisins
that
fades
into
dark
espresso
and
then
into
belgian
chocolate
this
is
definitely
a
nice
winter
warmer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
when
you
are
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
in
a
lightly
dimmed
room
overall
a
great
beer
with
an
original
label
nobody
gave
this
beer
a
narrative
review
not
a
good
sign
smuttynose
can
make
good
beer
ive
had
many
of
them
however
if
their
winter
offering
is
a
5
83
trappist
ale
that
nobody
will
take
the
time
to
write
anything
about
that
tells
you
something
this
may
be
due
to
smutty
fans
not
wanting
to
badmouth
their
brewery
which
is
admirable
and
understandable
however
a
belgian
dubbel
for
the
cold
season
at
5
83
was
a
mistake
they
would
have
been
more
honest
to
make
a
diet
cola
instead
what
a
waste
of
kettle
space
yes
session
beers
are
in
but
not
for
the
winter
and
certainly
not
belgian
dubs
the
caption

yeah

should
have
been

o

this
wasnt

on
slamming
you
with
a

trappist
inspired
8
dubbel
this
is
a
creation
of
its

and
one
smuttynose
can
be
proud
of
one
we
can
sit
down
during
the
cold
winter
months
and
drink
all
night
long
with
friends
and
family
yes
a
tasty
treat
during
these
brutally
cold
months
but
still
allowing
for
a
cadillac
of
a
brew
easy
going
and
flows
perfectly
these
were
smuttys
intentions
and
i
look
forward
to
this
for
years
to
come
smuttynose
does
a
consistently
good
job
again
consistent
love
this
brewer
one
of
the
best
winter
ales
ive
tried
in
a
long
time
smooth
mellow
taste
very
drinkable
no
weird
flavors
like
many
winter
ales
these
days
the
only
problem
is
it
is
disappearing
fast
along
with
the
winter
but
this
beer
could
work
all
year
long
i
hope
they
can
repeat
taste
is
pleasant
as
well
and
complex
to
boot
i
get
some
fruity
malts
and
yeasts
that
collide
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
touches
this
is
an
easy
to
enjoy
ale
that
works
perfectly
on
a
wintry
snowy
morning
prost
pours
a
brown
color
with
copper
edges
the
finger
of
head
dissipated
rather
quickly
and
only
left
a
trace
of
lace
behind
the
nose
is
distinctly
malty
the
flavor
profile
is
rather
malty
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
sticky
this
offering
is
not
quite
fullbodied
but
certainly
not
thin
at
all
if
not
for
the
metallic
character
this
would
be
superb
i
will
certainly
need
to
give
this
a
few
more
tries
to
see
if
it
is
just
an
off
bottle
i
think
smuttynose
is
right
on
target
using
a
belgian
dubbel
base
recipe
for
its
own
winter
warmer
the
problem
is
that
the
trappist
belgian
monks
got
there
first
the
smuttyversion
is
denser
richer
and
heavier
a
far
departion
from
the
drier
zestier
and
exuberant
examples
from
those
monasteries
o
quite
flavorful
and
much
easier
to
drink
than
a
lot
of
others
in
the
style
considering
the
rather
low
abv
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
and
one
i
would
definitely
grab
again
an
interesting
take
on
the
winter
beer
with
the
introduction
of
the
belgian
yeast
kind
of
a
hybrid
styled
beer
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
the
beer
increase
in
intensity
complexity
as
the
beer
warms
up
o
i
get
some
of
the
belgian
dubbel
connection
but
i
wouldnt
go
that
far
not
too
bad
mine
may
have
been
served
too
cold
the
mineral
feel
holds
it
back
notes
very
good
beer
my
first
review
of
a
smuttynose
sort
of
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
was
a
little
strange
hoppy
flavor
with
maybe
some
coffee
notes
nice
amber
color
full
body
some
dark
fruit
and
sugar
aromas
comes
through
on
the
nose
nice
beer
to
enjoy
by
a
fire
good
stuff
wolf
this
is
nasty
reminds
me
of
state
watered
down
ommegang
abbey
dubbel
the
flavors
are
there
dried
fruit
caramel
toffee
but
it
was
thin
and
bitter
it
was
a
pour
i
just
couldnt
drink
it
im
normally
a
smutty
fan
but
i
think
they
severely
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
i
was
hoping
time
to
warm
would
help
it
brings
out
more
yeast
character
unfortunately
it
also
brings
out
diacetyl
and
vegetal
notes
though
the
metallic
character
subsides
just
seems
stale
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
winter
beers
ive
tasted
in
quite
a
while
id
be
more
than
happy
with
a
sixpack
of
thisand
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
realize
i
could
say
that
about
any
of
the
smuttynose
beers
ive
tried
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
dark
fruits
a
bit
bready
taste
is
some
hops
up
front
then
malts
a
touch
of
caramel
not
as
much
fruit
as
the
smell
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
feel
holds
a
lot
of
dryness
with
a
slight
astringency
the
carbonation
is
less
than
moderate
as
it
has
a
thinness
but
its
not
weak
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
bodied
o
not
necessarily
something
id
search
out
regularly
but
very
solid
overall
id
definitely
drink
more
smuttynose
winter
ale
3
55
d
not
sure
about
the
stye
classification
i
would
consider
this
one
a
brown
ale
with
some
faint
belgian
characteristics
rather
than
a
dubbel
regardless
its
an
interesting
and
satisfying
brew
not
world
class
by
any
means
but
its
slightly
different
and
interesting
enough
to
impress
me
a
nice
take
on
the
winter
seasonal
overall
does
what
its
aming
to
do
and
id
certainly
buy
it
again
not
something
id
pick
up
all
the
time
but
as
a
winter
seasonal
its
a
solid
offering
o
okay
but
nothing
special
smutty
certainly
does
better
beers
creamy
warm
smooth
with
a
suttle
kick
im
thinking
the
abv
is
a
little
over
6
went
in
for
the
omb
dunkel
and
after
some
prodding
by
the
sales
rep
i
came
out
with
the
smutty
winter
st
one
straight
from
the
bottle
second
one
i
poured
jus
to
get
a
better
look
good
aroma
and
nice
red
head
really
has
body
and
hugs
the
glass
after
3
i
had
to
rest
my
eyes
a
good
solid
representation
of
the
holidaywinter
ale
class
but
not
mindblowing
this
beer
has
a
great
brown
color
the
smell
is
malty
with
some
wafts
of
caramel
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
bitter
and
there
is
almost
a
blackened
quality
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
there
but
not
much
as
the
smell
promises
i
havnt
had
many
beers
from
smutty
nose
but
this
isnt
bad
at
all
and
i
may
be
inclined
to
buy
some
other
of
their
beers
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
hit
its
mark
for
the
most
part
the
aroma
and
flavor
try
to
survive
on
caramel
malt
alone
with
some
esters
trying
to
help
out
in
the
flavor
unfortunately
a
few
off
flavors
creep
in
that
detract
from
what
this
beer
could
have
been
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
but
in
my
opinion
there
are
better
winter
offerings
and
better
dubbels
on
the
market
hayward
abbey
rating
77
overall
decent
not
great
i
wouldnt
call
this
remotely
a
dubbel
more
like
a
winter
brown
some
interesting
flavorsbut
a
bit
too
syrupy
and
too
much
of
the
not
so
great
hops
overall
a
nice
blend
of
malt
sweet
fruit
and
sugar
tastes
it
is
a
rather
balanced
winter
style
ale
that
is
well
worth
a
try
a
light
yet
very
enjoyable
session
beer
much
less
abv
than
most
dubbels
yet
it
has
many
classic
features
of
that
style
including
the
beautiful
color
and
head
smooth
yeasty
smell
and
taste
and
good
balance
it
might
be
a
little
light
for
some
but
the
taste
is
still
appealing
its
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
or
more
very
enjoyable
descent

better
what
this
is
a
belgian
dubbel
hey
a
good
winter
warmer
this
would
make
but
a
dubbel
no
dice
grandma
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
brownishred
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
fades
slowly
leaving
a
thin
ring
of
foam
with
beautiful
lacing
that
cascades
down
the
side
of
the
glass
after
holding
for
a
few
seconds
the
smell
is
remeniscent
of
a
glass
of
red
wine
grape
with
some
plum
cocoa
vanilla
spices
roasty
malts
and
finally
hops
the
aroma
is
terrifically
complex
it
has
a
rich
thick
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
the
taste
starts
off
light
and
fruity
but
turns
into
a
hoppy
spicy
earthy
brew
for
the
finish
the
malt
comes
through
a
lot
more
in
the
taste
it
finishes
semidry
with
some
dark
cocao
and
coffee
notes
along
with
a
sweet
yeastiness
to
round
it
all
out
definately
a
homerun
from
the
smuttynose
brewery
pours
a
murky
reddish
brown
with
two
fingers
thick
tan
colored
foam
settles
slowly
to
a
thin
ring

cheers
the
color
of
this
one
is
deep
copper
redish
pretty
clear
with
a
few
inches
of
finely
laced
tan
foam
the
nose
is
richly
malty
complex
ranging
from
american
amber
to
english
caramel
and
beyond
there
is
a
toffee
sort
of
sweetness
too
and
more
alcohol
hanging
around
than
the
abv
gives
away
the
flavor
confirms
that
this
is
definitely
a
malt
heavy
beer
which
is
nice
in
this
context
without
all
the
usual
spice
that
typifies
the
style
like
a
christmas
cookie
or
loaf
of
bread
rummy
tasty
the
sweetness
does
not
linger
on
in
the
finish
and
it
actually
ends
on
a
dry
note
the
flavors
a
good
but
they
all
seem
a
little
muted
to
me
not
the
depth
of
flavor
i
am
used
to
in
these
often
very
robust
beers
lots
of
body
and
an
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
not
my
favorite
of
the
winter
releases
but
an
easy
drinking
brew
nevertheless
pours
dark
reddish
brown
thick
retained
head
of
white
foam
sticky
strong
dark
fruity
nose
some
spices
strong
fruity
taste
somewhat
of
a
masked
hop
at
the
close
mellow
malty
flavor
almost
a
red
wine
flavor
too
really
flavorful
nice
spin
on
winter
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
clear
hazelnut
coloring
with
a
sparse
filmy
white
coating
on
the
surface
aromas
of
roasty
nut
and
biscuit
in
the
backbone
with
a
solid
spicing
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
rounding
out
the
sweet
rich
flavors
some
fruity
highlights
in
the
back
of
the
nose
also
flavors
of
deep
dark
old
world
fruit
including
prune
and
date
with
an
earthy
undertone
that
keeps
the
richness
in
check
spicing
takes
a
backseat
but
is
present
enough
to
perk
the
taste
buds
out
of
the
sweetness
shock
by
the
end
of
the
palate
sweet
and
spicy
blend
on
the
aftertaste
which
is
fairly
shortlived
despite
the
robust
initial
flavors
the
beer
is
smooth
and
round
but
the
spicing
and
carbonation
does
well
to
keep
it
light
in
mouth
frothy
slightly
sweet
lingering
finish
very
tasty
like
i
said
id
probably
have
this
for
the
family
if
it
was
more
widely
available
in
my
market
i
can
imagine
this
being
a
good
holiday
beer
for
average
drinkers
i
like
it
well
enough
either
way
this
beers
worth
drinking
several
times
over
the
holidays
overall
doesnt
seem
really
winter
like
but
i
enjoy
the
unique
flavors
the
flavor
and
smell
on
this
beer
might
have
been
the
most
difficult
for
me
to
id
but
it
is
very
tasty
oi
dont
like
this
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
good
dubbel
its
an
odd
dubbel
even
for
an
american
brewery
i
expect
more
from
smutty
it
almost
tastes
adjunct
to
me
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
winter
warmer
seasonals
ive
had
to
dateoutstanding
flavor
mixed
it
just
right
and
i
have
to
say
i
like
the
darker
malts
used
herenothing
is
overdone
and
everyone
seems
to
know
their
rolesthe
nose
could
awaken
a
bit
more
and
if
it
were
a
little
heavier
this
would
be
an
unbeatable
brewas
it
is
its
highly
recommended
for
your
next
christmas
party
and
with
its
relatively
low
abv
i
certainly
could
drink
this
all
night
and
be
merry
and
competent45
o
decent
would
have
again
but
wouldnt
seek
out
o
a
pleasant
brew
o
a
nice
americanstyle
dubbel
with
a
nice
belgian
flair
nothing
outstanding
about
this
but
it
is
a
nice
winter
beer
it
is
also
readily
available
through
the
colder
months
so
that
helps
as
well
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
i
do
most
it
is
beer
duh
and
im
ready
for
another
very
easy
to
drink
albeit
one
dimensional
but
i
wont
hold
that
against
it
i
did
expect
more
for
a
winter
brew
but
was
not
disappointed

an

it

a

light
slight
tart
apple
raisin

with

of

lacing

odd
beer
from

that
i
normally
put
way
up
on

felt
like
it
never
really
grabbed
an
identity
the
oddly
buttery
diacetyl
note
killed
it
for
me
without
that
add
another
letter
grade
at
least
final
thoughts
i
keep
changing
my
thoughts
on
smutty
nose
this
beer
is
wonderful
definitely
different
from
some
of
the
winter
offerings
smutty
nose
i
am
beginning
to
love
you
more
and
more
every
day
i
wonder
how
many
smuttys
have
been
consumed
in
alaska
this
one
was
honored
by
being
poured
into
a
midnight
sun
goblet
where
it
looked
very
inviting
it
was
medium
brown
but
deep
copper
when
held
to
light
and
clear
decent
tan
head
with
retention
faded
to
a
film
and
ring
spotty
lacing
smell
is
of
a
bunch
of
things
at
once
sweet
caramel
malty
lightly
roasty
grainy
nutty
fruity
esters
and
it
has
some
legs
taste
is
smooth
and
balanced
sweet
caramel
malty
flavors
are
backed
and
balanced
by
a
respectable
hop
presence
it
is
a
bit
boozy
nutty
and
fruity
tasty
and
fairly
complex
feel
is
moderately
strong
tingling
early
on
too
much
i
thought
it
seemed
to
fade
later
body
is
medium
full
with
a
pleasant
rich
texture
emerging
before
the
clean
finish
with
some
restrained
bitterness
and
dryness
overall
yum
very
easy
to
toss
this
one
back
many
of
the
categories
were
close
to
being
scored
one
step
up
i
liked
it
alot
d
i
could
sip
on
a
few
of
these
i
dont
know
if
a
dubbel
is
the
proper
classification
for
this
but
it
is
tasty
i
really
have
enjoyed
this
beer
thanks
john
very
good
i
would
definitely
try
again
as
with
most
smuttynose
brews
i
have
tried
interesting
beer
not
sure
its
one
id
seek
out
if
i
wanted
a
dubbel
but
i
could
see
ordering
one
after
shoveling
snow
for
a
couple
of
hours
d
unassuming
dubbel
with
good
easy
drinkability
without
being
overpowering
nicely
balanced
dubbel
by
an
american
brewery
the
color
is
a
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
respectable
offwhite
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
grassy
oatmeal
malt
sour
mash
sort
of
deal
the
taste
is
a
relatively
smooth
wheat
with
some
charcoal
under
a
fine
carbonation
a
medium
drinkable
brew
with
a
dry
paper
edge
alcohol
is
medium
and
overall
i
give
this
one
an
average
grade
not
bad
loads
of
sweet
malts
and
piney
flavors
very
smooth
with
fairly
low
carbonation
various
spice
notes
are
abundant
but
not
quite
identifiable
maybe
some
ginger
snaps
and
sugar
cookies
very
enjoyable
brew
my
first
smuttynose
i
do
believe
i
will
be
seeking
them
out
in
the
future
overall
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
reminded
me
an
awful
lot
of
the
mad
elf
which
is
a
completely
different
style
but
has
many
of
the
same
tastes
d
a
different
take
on
a
winter
ale
good
just
not
great
sweet
but
do
not
think
it
should
be
classified
as
a
dubbel
at
all
overall
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
other
smuttynose
products
ive
tried
theres
a
bit
too
much
unblended
alcohol
in
the
finish
at
6
8
it
shouldnt
be
that
harsh
in
my
opinion
overall
maybe
this
brew
has
been
changed
over
the
years
but
i
found
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
it
seems
to
be
rated
a
bit
low
imho
but
then
again
within
the
style
of
dubbel
there
are
certainly
much
better
brews
out
there
very
enjoyable
winter
brew
d
a
solidly
balanced
beer
that
gets
my
thorugh
the
new
england
winter
nights
this
is
decent
recommended
if
you
like
the
style
its
all
around
a
little
weird
but
dont
let
that
stop
ya
from
trying
one
d
very
different
than
other
winter
ales
i
have
had
in
the
past
perfect
on
a
cold
day
12
oz
bottle
a
dark
redamber
pour
but
a
good
amount
of
light
can
get
through
miniscule
white
head
sweet
malt
raisin
biscuity
aromas
tastes
a
bit
more
red
fruity
than
the
nose
but
still
with
some
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
spicyness
light
medium
bodied
finishes
with
a
hoppy
cleanliness
drinkability
is
solid
the
slight
uptick
in
abv
could
make
that
a
bit
dangerous
really
not
sure
how
this
is
a
dubbel
but
for
me
that
is
good
since
i
dont
care
for
them
not
a
bad
little
winter
warmer
at
all
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
procrastinating
it
is
slow
complex
and
makes
you
feel
warm
and
cozy
a
good
winter
ale
just
what
i
needed
before
going
out
to
shovel
or
maybe
i
will
sip
a
bit
slower
and
savor
this
one
as
long
as
i
can
d
a
unique
beer
thats
difficult
to
pin
a
style
on
i
suppose
dubbel
fits
it
well
enough
but
its
definitely
much
softer
and
much
more
mild
great
mix
of
flavors
going
on
here
and
extremely
drinkable
d
i
prefer
smuttynoses
sweet
winter
ale
to
the
other
spicy
or
hoppy
versions
the
beer
is
a
combo
of
true
belgian
yeast
with
west
coast
american
hops
to
continue
to
redefining
of
beer
in
america
smuttynose
has
some
gosh
darn
good
talent
near
their
vats
dpretty
much
average
all
around
a
decent
winter
ale
but
nothing
too
memorable
for
a
dubbel
it
lacks
the
belgian
kick
pours
a
dark
mahogony
and
puts
up
a
rich
2finger
off
white
head
smells
of
bread
malts
and
yeast
with
dark
fruits
taste
of
cherry
figs
dates
and
maybe
some
oats
a
smooth
sipper
and
an
easy
drinker
medium
bodied
a
good
winter
warmer
cheers
tastes
fine
i
was
expecting
a
winter
warmer
not
a
dubbel
but
hey
still
good
for
a
winter
offering
worth
trying
na
zdravje
carbonated
but
not
mouth
clearing
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
a
beer
that
doesnt
have
a
direction
to
go
in
almost
as
if
it
is
not
sure
what
it
should
be
ok
but
not
great
drinkability
probably
my
least
favorite
style
of
beer
not
complex
at
all
and
very
little
aroma
i
dont
see
a
reason
why
you
would
reach
for
this
beer
over
another
d
all
around
good
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
overall
its
easy
sippin
goes
down
easy
and
refreshing
if
youre
thirsty
its
nothing
too
complex
though
if
thats
what
youre
lookin
for
so
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
that
aspect
the
drink
is
heavymedium
in
body
with
a
fine
spritz
of
carbonation
an
inoffensive
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
appearance
deep
dark
chestnut
not
much
head
or
lacing
probably
shouldnt
have
poured
into
imperial
pint
just
see
now
it
is
a
dubbel
malty
with
boozey
earthy
finish
though
mild
okay
mouthfeel
nothing
more
than
average
body
and
carb
which
makes
it

sweetness
is
balanced
out
well
with

is
very
high
due
to
the
good
balance
and
tolerable
abv
overall
i
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
although
i
am
unfamiliar
with
the
style
a
good
introduction
to
smuttynose
offerings
a
very
enjoyable
brew
during
the
holidays
a
bit
more
complex
and
enjoyable
as
it
gets
warmer
i
really
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
because
a
ive
been
impressed
by
everything
else
from
smuttynose
and
b
the
label
hands
down
gets
my
vote
for
most
awesome
but
i
was
left
wondering
if
this
was
actually
a
dubbel
or
a
hopped
up
brown
ale
or
i
dunno
a
belgian
dark
maybe
just
call
it
a
winter
warmer
and
be
done
with
it
the
taste
will
not
disappoint
this
is
medium
bodied
beer
modestly
carbonated
with
a
nice
heavy
fruit
flavored
base
some
roasted
maltiness
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
throughout
and
just
enough
of
a
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
top
this
very
good
beer
off
there
is
a
nice
malty
and
hop
balance
to
the
beer
there
is
almost
a
sweet
nutty
partially
roasted
quality
to
the
beer
that
is
complemented
very
nicely
by
the
character
of
the
hop
i
had
this
beer
a
few
weeks
ago
and
i
specifically
sought
it
out
to
review
im
glad
i
did
a
great
beer
out
of
smuttynose
brewery
lchaim
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
leaning
to
the
lighter
side
not
a
lot
of
complexitybelgian
howdidtheydothat
bt
nonetheless
a
decent
dubbel
if
youve
never
tried
this
style
of
beer
give
this
a
shot
to
experience
a
solid
american
brewerys
take
on
a
belgian
classic
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
drink
it
again
this
winter
season
d
very
drinkable
not
overpowering
too
overpowering
a
nice
winter
beer
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
but
im
glad
i
did
this
is
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
assuming
thats
what
it
actually
is
low
on
the
phenolics
tastes
more
like
a
winter
warmer
or
something
drinkability
warming
and
balanced
good
showing
for
this
years
winter
seasonal
d
this
is
very
drinkable
for
6
8
im
a
big
fan
of
the
smuttynose
products
love
the
labels
d
overall
a
pretty
solid
warming
winter
beer
i
wish
that
it
were
less
carbonated
because
it
could
be
much
better
if
so
i
could
have
a
couple
on
a
winter
night
not
my
favorite
offering
from
smuttynose
but
a
good
brew
nonetheless
that
im
sure
i
will
enjoy
throughout
the
season
at
first
this
tasted
like
a
homebrew
gone
awry
but
it
mellowed
out
and
came
together
as
it
warmed
up
i
recommend
this
one
out
of
the
cellar
instead
of
out
of
the
fridge
i
thought
of
it
more
as
a
winter
warmer
type
than
the
style
it
is
listed
asbut
no
disrespect
as
it
was
good
d
i
got
really
excited
about
this
beer
when
i
picked
it
up
i
got
even
more
excited
when
i
learned
it
was
similar
to
a
dubbel
unfortunately
this
beer
does
not
approach
the
level
of
richness
complexity
and
class
of
a
dubbel
big
deductions
for
mislabeling
this
one
in
all
i
have
enjoyed
many
smuttynose
beers
but
this
is
certainly
one
exception
i
gotta
be
honest
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
that
fact
that
smuttynoses
website
calls
it
stylistically
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
abbey
double
bothers
me
i
dont
care
what
kind
of
yeast
it
has
it
simply
does
not
rise
to
level
to
of
a
dubbel
it
lacks
the
complexity
and
finesse
on
every
level
that
said
its
really
not
bad
in
and
of
itself
it
pours
an
attractive
clear
brown
with
little
in
the
way
of
foam
it
has
a
faint
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
cloves
and
tastes
like
a
sweetened
brown
ale
its
finely
carbonated
medium
body
and
pleasant
flavor
make
it
eminently
drinkable
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
brew
almost
porterstoutlike
burnt
flavor
but
more
malty
and
sweeter
i
will
definately
buy
more
of
these
pours
a
nice
brown
minimal
head
and
lacing
kind
of
a
slightly
burnt
sweetness
in
the
aroma
sweet
malt
was
the
first
phrase
that
came
to
mind
the
taste
is
smooth
and
balanced
the
balanced
taste
and
smooth
finish
make
this
highly
drinkable
another
solid
brew
from
smutty
a
solid
winter
brew
from
smuttynose
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
im
happy
to
be
drinking
really
nothing
amazing
given
the
number
of
great
beers
that
fit
within
this
style
but
nothing
wrong
with
going
local
poured
a
dark
redbrown
with
a
thin
coco
brown
head
that
went
away
almost
immediately
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smelled
of
sweet
malts
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
taste
starts
off
slightly
tart
with
sweet
malts
and
traces
of
dark
fruits
present
maybe
raisins
or
prunes
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
in
between
a
standard
amber
and
belgian
with
the
tiny
bubbles
in
the
carbonation
sneaking
in
there
drinkability
seems
like
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
this
evening
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
stuff
but
it
is
much
better
the
average
beer
i
must
say
pours
a
nice
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
nice
head
to
it
smell
is
faint
which
is
a
tad
disappointing
taste
is
great
though
very
smooth
with
a
nice
touch
of
the
belgian
sugars
at
the
end
and
its
all
smooth
and
makes
for
a
nice
drinkable
winter
brew
this
is
6
8
abv
that
should
be
a
crime
tastes
like
a
tasty
soda
for
its
heft
this
drinks
mightly
well
its
getting
very
difficult
to
be
disappointed
by
any
smutty
offerings
these
days
d
decent
drinkability
and
a
nice
winter
warmer
treat
dgood
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
very

i
would
buy
again
winter
ales
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
alright

disappointing
appearance
subtle
semisweet
nose
of

some

sort
of
like
a

how
apropos
to
the
season
flavors
are
of
dark
fruit
hops
in
the
middle
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
long
malt
finish
a
robust
winter
red
reminiscent
of
an
irish
red
medium
body
seems
a
little
light
for
a
winter
beer
medium
carbonation
good
mouthfeel
good
but
really
not
the
beer
i
would
turn
to
for
the
dark
and
frigid
vermont
months
pours
reddish
brown
and
clear
with
a
short
lived
tan
head
smell
is
nutty
dark
fruitiness
caramel
with
a
faint
belgian
yeast
character
perhaps
taste
is
dark

caramel
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
is
pretty
good
full
body
with
a
light
to
medium
carbonation
pretty
solid
for
a
style
i
dont
particularly
care
for
normally
nice
winter
brew
m
d
a
little
bit
of
a
sting
of
carbonation
it
could
have
gone
a
little
smoother
for
my
palate
otherwise
a
reasonably
decent
take
on
the
style
it
comes
across
to
me
as
something
of
a
little
more
relaxed
style
of
dubbel
and
that
its
not
meant
to
be
viewed
as
the
same
as
those
coming
over
from
belgium
and
the
like
looking
at
it
that
way
its
a
decent
brew
and
something
about
it
kind
of
does
have
that
yuletide
feeling
worth
a
shot
oelergud
drinkability
is
nice
it
is
not
too
strong
for
a
dubbel
so
that
helps
a
very
average
offering
for
a
dubbel
i
guess
it
would
not
have
been
that
bad
as
a
starter
dubbel
for
someone
who
had
never
tried
the
style
before
decent
stuff
from
smuttynose
and
a
good
wintertime
brew
not
what
one
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
and
a
rather
simple
beer
but
i
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
one
night
this
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
medium
bodied
but
tall
tan
colored
head
that
laced
the
glass
all
the
way
down
it
smells
of
very
sweet
roasted
malts
some
spices
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
good
with
a
deep
roasted
but
sweet
malt
base
followed
by
some
spices
like
cinnamon
and
some
others
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
then
some
fruity
taste
and
finally
a
very
slight
hoppy
finish
with
a
nice
aftertaste
of
chocolate
not
much
detection
of
the
alcohol
i
was
expecting
from
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
good
very
fresh
and
smooth
and
warming
on
the
way
down
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
and
i
would
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
i
dont
really
think
that
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
overall
i
believe
this
beer
has
been
classified
incorrectly
it
tastes
much
more
like
a
bock
than
a
dubbel
still
an
amazingly
tasty
and
strong
winter
brew
smutty
continues
to
make
really
decent
brews
this
is
no
exception
i
like
the
mouth
feel
its
a
bit
thick
but
smooth
and
the
extra
alcohol
picks
it
up
a
bit
i
think
it
would
be
nice
on
a
cold
night
with
friends
and
potatoes
sausage
cheese
etc
standing
by
its
self
though
id
like
it
to
be
a
bit
more
exciting
i
found
this
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
also
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
others
had
indicated
overall
average
2
6
verdict
nice
and
drinkable
has
the
hallmarks
of
the
style
as
well
i
think
its
solid
drinkable
this
wasnt
bad
i
liked
the
full
rich
tastes
of
the
malt
and
spices
that
leant
themselves
well
to
winter
imbibing
and
that
nearly
7
abv
was
very
well
hidden
and
kept
things
fairly
drinkable
a
solid
effort
from
smutty
d
i
would
have
another
and
buy
again
the
belgian
characteristics
just
arent
as
pronounced
as
they
should
be
but
still
a
very
good
beer
this
one
certainly
warms
you
up
and
could
drink
several
in
a
row
but
would
probably
opt
for
some
lighter
fare
after
2
or
3
anyway
its
an
ok
brown
ale
interesting
faint
caramelchocolatebisccuit
nose
and
mouth
interesting
but
well
not
that
interesting
it
says
winter
ale
i
want
it
to
be
hearty
with
this
thin
mouth
its
far
from
that
its
closer
to
what
i
drink
when
its
really
hot
out
whatever
i
guess
to
each
their
own
smutty
never
fails
to
deliver
a
quality
brew
very
drinkable
hides
the
alchohol
pretty
well
considering
the
abv
while
not
my
favorite
winter
selection
i
could
definitely
session
this
one
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
carbonation
is
fine
fairly
drinkable
but
the
spices
wear
on
me
not
bad
but
not
smuttynoses
finest
altogether
a
strange
mix
and
a
mash
up
of
a
winter
warmer
and
dubbel
i
would
have
preferred
more
of
a
yeasty
flavor
and
less
of
a
spiced
flavor
di
hade
no
idea
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
dubbel
when
i
reviewed
it
however
it
does
explain
the
yeastiness
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
would
expect
a
larger
creamier
long
lasting
head
but
of
course
i
already
dinged
ot
for
this
in
the
appearance
overall
it
is
a
nice
beer
winter
warmer
or
debbel
not
too
bad
for
a
seasonal
but
there
are
better
dubbels
out
there
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
rubybrown
with
cranberry
colored
highlights
when
backlit
twofingered
offwhite
head
settled
into
an
oily
skim
of
foam
lacing
consisted
of
concentric
rings
adhering
to
the
glassware
as
the
brew
was
consumed
smell
of
malt
and
subtle
scent
of
candied
darkfruit
not
sure
what
though
and
yeast
taste
similar
to
nose
with
more
pronounced
dark
fruit
flavors
plums
prunes
raisins
present
but
not
particularly
sweet
nice
mouthfeel
but
somewhat
more
watery
than
other
dubbels
i
have
sampled
ending
with
a
pleasant
malty
finish
a
nice
seasonal
although
at
6
8
abv
a
little
on
the
highside
for
a
session
brew
however
i
could
definitely
quaff
2
or
3
in
a
sitting
drinkability
definitely
a
good
winter
brew
and
a
good
experiment
with
both
the
belgian
flavors
and
the
hoppiness
to
combine
into
something
really
interesting
and
refreshing
i
like
to
have
it
a
few
times
each
winter
and
i
hope
they
keep
making
it
for
the
season
d
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
this
beer
so
i
really
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
as
i
mentioned
above
it
seems
too
boozy
for
an
under7

very
much
pours
a
clean
clear
ruby
with
brown
color
into
a

glass
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
dissipates
quickly
aroma
of
nutmeg
and
maple
mix
with
a
spiciness
from
the
hops
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
malt
as
a
good
winter
ale
should
be
and
again
the
spiciness
comes
through
more
maple
and
brown
sugar
flavor
finishes
with
a
malty
sweetness
becomes
increasingly
drinkable
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
also
quite
malty
but
not
in
a
sweet
way
now
the
spice
kicks
in
touches
of
fruit
decent
carbonation
can
make
out
the
alcohol
a
bit
could
have
benefited
from
being
more
sweet
though
nice

color
very
little
carbonation
a
fairly
hard
pour
left
a
half
finger
of
head
that
dissipated
quickly
there
is
a
strange
sharpness
in
the
smell
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
body
was
very
weak
at
first
but
came
out
more
as
the
beer
warmed
hints
of
maple
and
caramel
finishes
very
clean
with
little
aftertaste
very
smooth
mouthfeel
almost
too
clean
heavier
carbonation
would
be
appreciated
not
a
bad
brew
nice
winter
beer
for
sure
and
an
interesting
take
on
a
dubbel
it
seems
to
me
like
a
cross
between
a
dubbel
and
a
winter
warmer
but
without
the
spice
of
either
dfor
a
winter
beer
this
was
very
drinkable
if
i
was
at
any
other
bar
i
would
have
had
a
second
had
this
one
on
tap
at
mahars
poured
to
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
good
sized
tan
head
nice
retention
left
a
lot
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aromas
remind
me
of
berries
caramel
malts
with
a
slight
yeast
quality
the
flavors
seem
to
revolve
around
the
malt
flavors
giving
it
a
toasted
feel
with
a
yeast
like
biscuit
taste
when
looking
up
this
brew
it
really
surprised
me
to
see
it
as
a
dubbel
as
the
characteristics
of
a
dubbe
did
not
come
out
for
me
even
with
this
being
said
this
was
a
good
brew
very
nice
flavor
and
quite
easy
drinking
i
would
get
this
one
again
without
question
very
very
interesting
and
certainly
one
of
the
more
thought
provokeing
winter
ales
around
pours
a
hazy
nut
brown
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
slight
cap
the
smell
is
light
i
pick
up
some
nut
and
slight
fruit
aromas
the
brew
has
a
steely
roasted
malt
base
which
has
some
nutty
characteristics
there
is
also
some
dark
fruit
notes
that
sweeten
up
the
taste
if
this
is
truely
a
dubbel
it
is
definitely
not
as
sweet
as
its
belgian
counterparts
i
cant
say
that
i
pick
up
any
belgian
candi
sugar
sweetness
the
feel
is
moderate
with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
well
balanced
a
very
enjoyable
brew
and
a
good
winter
brew
to
try
it
is
not
spiced
up
like
some
winters
and
it
is
nice
and
balanced
d
drinks
well
i
could
easily
put
down
34
in
an
evening
this
will
be
a
good
one
for
parties
i
poured
this
brewsky
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
mahogany
color
with
a
fine
tan
head
unfortunatly
that
did
not
last
very
long
it
did
lace
well
though
the
smell
was
slightly
sweet
as
was
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
toffee
i
really
liked
this
beer
as
it
was
a
nice
dark
beer
but
not
thick
like
tar
i
think
it
is
a
great
beer
for
folks
wanting
to
break
into
the
dark
realm
i
will
buy
again
for
sure
this
beer
has
a
decent
auroma
although
it
is
slightly
lacking
in
flavor
there
just
isnt
really
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
the
alchol
is
strong
in
this
one
so
is
the
carbonation
the
sweet
malt
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
here
texture
is
creamy
and
drinkable
but
the
taste
is
still
pucker
inducing
some
spice
maybe
nutmeg
certainly
has
some
flavor
but
not
really
my
style
ill
stop
at
one
pours
a
chestnut
color
with
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
to
the
beer
some
lace
to
start
with
that
also
quickly
fades
away
some
aromas
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
and
a
sharp
scent
of
alcohol
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
slight
caramel
with
some
brown
sugar
slightly
oily
slick
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
body
with
a
carbonation
that
sort
went
flat
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
beer
again
i
love
a
good
dark
winter
ale
and
ive
always
enjoyed
smuttynose
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
what
but
it
seems
that
this
one
could
be
better
than
it
was
it
has
a
lovely
dark
brown
hue
and
a
nice
smell
but
it
seemed
a
tad
undercarbonated
although
it
had
a
great
complex
flavor
the
somewhat
low
fizz
took
away
from
the
enjoyment
im
chalking
it
up
to
bad
luck
im
going
to
give
this
one
another
try
stick
this
one
in
a
chalice
or
snifter
i
figured
it
was
a
typical
winter
warmer
and
put
it
in
a
pint
glass
probably
losing
something
on
the
nose
i
was
never
really
all
that
interested
in
trying
this
beer
as
i
tend
to
gravitate
toward
the
belgian
examples
of
this
style
but
the
other
night
there
was
nothing
very
interesting
at
the
store
up
the
street
and
the
label
art
is
quite
charming
pours
a
average
looking
chestnut
brown
color
with
little
head
but
a
nice
looking
ring
lace
around
the
glass
smell
had
brown
sugar
chocolate
various
spices
and
a
bit
of
fruity
alcohol
taste
was
largely
characterized
by
fruits
mainly
plums
cherries
strawberries
with
a
backbone
of
malt
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
in
the
middle
i
would
say
not
too
much
hop
usage
but
the
little
that
is
there
helps
to
balance
the
malt
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
dubbels
i
have
tasted
in
a
while
if
i
was
to
have
it
in
a
blind
tasting
i
would
probably
guess
that
this
came
from
belgium
another
very
good
beer
from
smuttynose
a
nice
brown
color
but
very
little
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
carmellike
a
complex
taste
of
sweet
bitter
and
toasted
malt
the
aftertaste
is
a
definite
smoky
malt
taste
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
nice
even
carbonation
the
aftertaste
lingers
in
the
mouth
with
the
smoky
malt
flavors
a
good
beer
to
serve
on
a
cold
day
but
the
complexity
of
flavors
and
smoky
aftertaste
make
this
too
much
of
a
beer
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
ill
have
a
few
more
this
winter
this
beer
seems
to
have
characteristics
of
a
brown
ale
a
winter
warmer
and
a
belgian
dubbel
but
doesnt
strike
me
as
being
distinctly
any
one
of
the
three
whatever
it
is
it
exhibits
typical
smuttynose
quality
and
is
quite
delicious
ill
be
buying
more
the
fruitiness
has
emerged
and
made
this
a
better
beer
with
a
little
time
but
with
the
green
apple
tartness
rearing
up
even
though
what
it
has
added
is
generally
pleasant
so
far
i
think
it
will
likely
go
downhill
quickly
with
additional
time
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
decent
representation
of
style
it
might
not
be
your
prototypical
winter
seasonal
but
its
still
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
could
certainly
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
i
nice
mellow
dark
belgian
the
flavor
isnt
too
rich
or
complex
but
its
fairly
spot
on
for
the
belgian
basics
just
sweet
fruit
candy
and
malt
flavors
its
at
least
as
good
as
leffe
brunebrown
if
you
can
find
it
for
a
reasonable
price
i
recommend
it
very
nice
beer
this
beer
seems
to
have
characteristics
of
a
brown
ale
a
winter
warmer
and
a
belgian
dubbel
but
doesnt
strike
me
as
being
distinctly

is

cheers
d
was
nice
to
see
a
brewery
do
a
winter
ale
thats
not
just
a
cinnamon
nutmeg
bomb
and
this
is
pretty
solid
its
a
nice
stab
at
the
style
but
it
obviously
wont
displace
chimay
red
or
westmalle
in
the
dubbel
camp
pretty
good
very
drinkable
reminds
me
of
anchor
osa
a
bit
2006
not
as
spicy
though
a
hoppy
brown
ale
with
spices
some
nice
lacing
present
the
flavor
is
malted
and
balanced
it
ends
nice
and
clean
without
lingering
the
6
8
is
buried
but
not
lost
not
offensive
i
will
actually
enjoy
finishing
this
one
damn
what
a
little
find
this
is
i
wish
i
would
have
been
drinking
this
all
winter
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
as
well
i
knew
that
a
dubbel
was
a
very
atypical
choice
for
a
winter
seasonal
but
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
some
nice
cheddar
would
be
great
with
it
this
will
definitely
become
an
annual
part
of
my
winter
cellar
and
i
highly
recommend
this
little
sleeper
a
great
bang
for
the
buck
for
those
belgian
fans
definitely
check
this
out
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
fruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dry
hoppy
flavor
that
is
laid
over
a
malt
bill
of
belgian
pale
and
crystal
malts
its
robust
with
some
roasted
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
seasonal
brew
its
tastey
and
highly
drinkable
drinkability
not
quite
as
strong
flavors
as
many
other
dubbels
but
still
pretty
good
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
dark
amber
bordering
on
burgandy
with
lots
of
lacing
and
pretty
nice
light
tan
head
down
to
a
thin
film
with
the
aroma
and
taste
its
quite
malty
yeasty
biscuts
fruits
and
clove
a
little
honey
perhaps
everything
a
good
dubbel
should
have
but
as
winter
ale
would
imply
it
leans
a
bit
more
on
certain
spices
that
give
it
that
warmer
quality
there
is
a
mild
warming
good
body
really
a
good
beer
and
a
easy
quaffer
this
beer
is
cherrywood
colored
with
a
lot
of
fine
head
the
beer
has
a
hoppy
smell
taste
is
very
spicy
like
lakefront¬ís
holiday
beer
but
not
like
a
dubbel
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
the
taste
is
very
good
with
strong
malts
and
mild
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
very
mild
alcohol
flavor
i
also
detect
a
bit
of
graininess
the
mf
is
medium
bodied
and
is
both
spicy
and
tangy
poured
a
medium
brown
with
the
slightest
red
hue
small

of
large
carbonation
bubbles
spicey
nutty
malty
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
closer
to
5
very
creamy
despite
its
watery
appearance
fulfilling
on
the
palate
bit
of
sweetness
and
very
moderate
hops

color
with
a

big

of

notes
some
bitter

good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
another
wonderful
brew
from
smuttynose
that
hit
the
spot
on
a
cold
winter
night
d
no
question
great
tilted
dark
with
significant
white
head
some
brown
flecks

cardamon

more

not
that
strong

medium

crossstyle
belgian
and
winter
warmer
neither
hits
the
spot
of
either
but
certainly
not
unpleasant
thanks
jb
quite
nice
i
am
enjoying
this
more
than
i
have
some
authentic
belgian
dubbels
pours
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
dark
mahogany
in
color
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
and
some
nice
sticky
lacing
nice
smell
sweet
malts
and
some
earthy
hops
as
for
the
taste
nice
sweet
caramel
malts
a
hint
of
breadiness
and
nice
earthy
hops
nice
mouthfeel
medium
amount
of
carbonation
solid

drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
winters
night
poured
into
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
redbrown
very
little
head
that
quickly
disappeared
very
little
aroma
slight
sweet
maltyness
hiding
tasted
of
medium
spice
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
isnt
very
noticable
carbonation
could
be
tasted
despite
the
lack
of
head
tasted
ok
in
the
mouth
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
expect
a
winter
beer
to
be
slightly
spicier
but
other
than
that
its
a
solid
beer
overall
a
drinkable
beer
with
some
very
interesting
merits
and
something
id
probably
buy
again
to
test
out
but
not
something
im
crazy
about
drinkable
for
sure
just
not
great
overall
a
decent
dubbel
and
a
good
winter
brew
the
drinkability
is
average
based
on
some
of
the
off
flavors
d
not
bad
but
nothing
special
either
d
this
on
the
low
point
of
a
winter
ale
not
to
crazy
about
it
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
poured

seem
a

dumbed
down
somewhat
yeasty
with
colalike
flavors
and

but
they
really
dont

themselves
much
the
sharp
mouthfeel
becomes
more
assertive
as
i
drink
more
really
making
it
less
drinkable
eh
not
my
thing
here
i
dont
drnk
many
of
the
style

i
look
a
well
made

sorry

this

by
minimal

some

and
a
slightly
bitter

finish
moderate
carbonation
and
fairly
easy
drinking
for
a
big
beer
pleasent
but
not
outstanding
this
is
a
nice
seasonal
from
one
of
my
favorite
locals
had
i
rated
this
to
the
dubbel
style
i
think
i
may
have
scored
it
lower
however
i
think
smuttynose
is
successful
in
creating
a
truly
unique
winter
ale
drinkability
is
okay
but
nothing
too
spectacular
a
somewhat
disappointing
effort
from
a
good
brewery

a

be
drinking
this
again
this

also
would
like
to
cellar
a
few
done
of
the
better
winter
offerings
out
there
certainly

never
feels
like
a
huge
sipping

beer
but
there
is
no

this
has
some
depth
to
it
overall
not
a
bad
winter
ale
definitely
more
on
the
sweet
side
than
i
like

not

the
palate
a
pretty
poor
offering
for
a
winter
ale
from
smuttynose
or
at
least
like
it
a
lot
but
what
a
great
idea
perhaps
a
bit
high
in
the
phenols
but
the
spicy
quality
balances
it
out
they
should
kick
up
the
complexity
and
move
it
to
the
big
beer
series
wedgedec

and
a
low
hop
character
and
i
swear
and
its
their
take
on
the
style
theyre
not
trying
to
be
but
the
alcohol
would
be
too
much
would
prefer
this
as
part
of
a
winter
sampler
rather
than
a
whole
six
pack

just
hit
milwaukee
so
i
was
excited
to
try
this
not
sure
what
style
this
was
when
i
bought
it
bittersweet
and
long
a
nice
surprise
this
one
wasbeerluvrnov
09
and
a
good
take
on
a
spiced
winter
seasonal
that
probably
contains
no
actual
spices
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
schooner
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
vibrant
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
thin
low
profile
offwhite
head
aromas
of
sugary
sweetness
roasted
nut
tangy
caramel
and
some
old
world
fruit
sweetness
very
heavy
and
cloying
sweetness
flavors
are
very
sweet
forward
with
a
blast
of
date
fig
cherry
and
berry
notes
that
border
on
sugarysyrupy
candi
sugar
in
there
too
making
this
a
real
sweet
tooth
brew
wow
the
body
is
light
but
a
bit
chewy
from
all
the
sweetness
the
aftertaste
is
all
the
berry
and
cherry
again
and
that
lingers
through
the
slick
slightly
oily
finish
this
one
leans
far
too
sweet
and
sugary
for
me
for
the
style
i
popped
the
cap
and
began
the
pour
which
resulted
in
a
lot
of
rocky
lighttan
head
coming
up
as
if
i
were
pouring
a
bottle
of
pop
it
fell
as
quickly
as
it
rose
but
it
left
a
bunch
of
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake

i
picked
this
up
for
my
wife
who
has
a
gluten
allergy
relative
to
other
gluten
free
beers
this
is
not
bad
relative
to
everything
else
o
not
bad
at
all
rather
surpriseddelighted
that
alternatives
exist
for
those
that
cant
have
gluten
i
wouldnt
swap
it
for
chimay
or
ommegang
but
itll
do
in
a
pinch
aroma
of
sherry
wine
vegetal
dirt
taste
dry
vinous
faint
cherry
coke
prunes
not
a
dubbel
another
undrinkable
gluten
pours
a
pretty
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
almost
black
with
a
good
3finger
thick
foamy
beige
head
that
last
a
good
while
before
settling
down
to
a
good
23mm
head
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
and
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
rice
and
sweet
dark
molasses
the
label
sayswater
milletbuckwheat
rice
sorghum
hops
and
yeast
lots
going
on
with
the
taste
as
you
can
taste
the
ingredients
listed
including
the
water
lol
goes
down
easy
with
a
very
slight
dry
bitter
finish
that
doesnt
last
also
a
slight
different
aftertaste
is
noted
not
bad
but
different
overall
a
different
but
decent
brew
wonderful
gluten
free
ale
but
expensive
i
cannot
believe
that
anyone
rated
this
gluten
free
delight
poorly
even
though
it
wasnt
easy
to
discern
the
alcohol
was
spoton
and
the
somewhat
creamy
aspect
of
the
mouthfeel
led
this
to
go
down
easy
would
gluten
have
added
more
body
to
this
beer
probably
but
even
with
that
it
would
have
still
been
light
i
wouldnt
trash
this
like
others
have
on
here
but
at
the
same
time
this
wasnt
anything
special
a
good
beer
should
enhance
a
meal
and
with
the
bread
and
seafood
that
i
enjoyed
this
paired
just
fine
worth
a
try
once
for
anyone
who
wants
a
light
belgianstyle
beer
with
dinner
without
being
overwhelmed
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
colour
very
fruity
nose
with
scents
of
pearpear
skin
port
and
dried
plum
flavours
of
cherry
and
cola
on
the
palate
with
a
tart
dry
finish
its
not
as
heavy
as
an
abbey
ale
but
has
nice
similarities
flavour
wise
light
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
just
as
nasty
as
the
other
two
greens
beers
i
picked
up
thankfully
i
am
done
with
these
putrid
beers
now
and
can
get
on
to
something
better
i
should
have
know
better
than
to
buy
all
3
of
these
greens
beers
without
checking
any
ratings
first
overall
an
ok
beer
for
being
gluten
free
oh
my
god
i
bought
this
because
i
had
a
friend
who
had
allergic
issues
it
taste
like
a
dark
corona
its
barely
drinkable
and
franky
for
the
calories
i
might
just
drain
pour
and
open
something
decent
to
get
this
aweful
taste
out
of
my
mouth
ick
o
one
of
the
better
glutenfree
offererings
ive
had
the
flavors
almost
remind
me
of
lindemans
faro
at
the
beginning
while
not
strictly
adhering
to
the
flavors
you
would
find
in
a
traditional
dubbel
it
is
still
quite
good
for
what
it
is
my
wife
who
has
been
searching
for
a
decent
gluten
free
beer
for
a
while
says
that
this
is
her
absolute
favorite
o
as
a
dubbel
its
really
off
the
mark
as
a
dubbelflanders
red
hybrid
this
is
very
good
overall
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
dubbel
but
as
a
gluten
free
beer
its
the
best
ive
had
and
ive
tried
most
of
them
a
beer
brewed
with
millet
rice
buckwheat
and
sorghum
i
would
also
like
to
add
no
redeeming
value
for
a
beer
drinker
if
i
had
siliacs
disease
i
would
do
my
best
to
make
this
beer
work
that
being
said
i
do
not
so
i
wont
and
i
recommend
you
do
the
same
to
me
this
seems
more
like
an
alcoholic
cola
rather
than
a
dubbel
its
like
a
sparkling
red
wine
with
some
yeast
thrown
in
not
as
good
as
quest
and
not
a
great
dubbel
but
it
has
a
huge
disadvantage
being
gluten
free
for
some
reason
it
reminds
me
of
christmas
i
could
drink
this
while
decorating
the
christmas
tree
onot
a
great
dubbel
when
compared
to
barley
based
gluten
beers
but
as
a
gluten
free
beer
this
is
very
good
greens
has
produced
the
best
bottled
gluten
free
beers
on
the
market
i
wish
more
brewers
would
enter
the
game
o
a
fine
and
distinct
belgian
dubbel
little
hampered
by
the
gluten
free
goal
while
this
makes
a
fine
sipper
it
is
exceptionally
drinkable
and
can
disappear
quickly
less
than
world
class
but
not
actually
disappointing
well
like
many
of
the
other
glutenfree
beers
ive
had
this
just
seems
to
be
sorely
missing
the
right
grain
backbone
conversely
however
it
does
a
decent
job
of
providing
some
of
the
other
flavour
characteristics
inherent
in
the
proclaimed
style
and
hides
its
elevated
alcohol
well
enough
overall
though
one
out
of
two
and
a
half
just
doesnt
cut
it
im
afraid
drinkable
i
suppose
but
this
is
not
the
dubbel
youre
looking
for
ahhh
the
belgians
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
very
tall
light
brown
fluffy
head
not
bad
lace
smell
reminds
me
of
rum
and
coke
and
dark
fruits
with
the
sweetness
of
the
coke
and
a
light
bite
of
rum
in
the
aroma
it
also
tastes
a
little
like
rum
and
coke
with
a
bit
earthiness
put
into
it
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
id
like
to
have
seen
my
face
in
the
mirror
after
having
that
1st
sip
interesting
different
not
necessarily
bad
but
probably
not
again
however
i
dig
this
concept
and
there
is
definitely
a
skill
level
involved
to
the
brewing
consider
for
a
second
for
either
situation
a
you
are
allergic
to
nearly
everything
on
earth
but
would
love
to
drink
beer
or
b
your
conscience
or
boss
says
to
make
a
beer
without
malt
wheat
or
anything
not
hypoallergenic
yes
it
is
generously
mentioned
that
there
is
no
fish
eggs
celery
or
mustard
involved
either
way
you
would
have
to
be
pleased
with
this
offering
especially
if
it
were
more
dry
final
notes
its
worth
a
shot
if
you
just
absolutely
cant
have
real
beer
that
said
its
not
as
good
as
the
real
thing
but
no
glutenfree
beer
will
ever
be
d
ultimately
the
drying
metallic
tang
from
the
brown
rice
renders
this
a
oneoff
for
me
im
going
to
try
others
since
i
do
have
celliac
friends
and
id
like
to
find
something
we
can
all
enjoy
together
this
is
my
first
foray
into
gluten
free
beers
not
impressed
my
scores
actually
might
be
too
high
the
only
other
gluten
free
beer
i
have
tasted
was
an
ab
product
and
it
wasnt
bad
this
was
reviewed
on
01212010

i
would
not
recomend
this
as
an
alternative
for
those
who
cant
enjoy
regular
beer
types
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
slightly
translucent
beer
with
a
thick
frothy
head
made
up
of
large
bubbles
most
of
the
head
disappeared
quickly
leaving
some
bubbles
clinging
to
the
sides
with
a
thin
layer
on
top
aroma
was
slightly
alcoholy
with
some
bitterness
bananas
and
also
some
burnt
sugar
sweetness
contradicting
the
acidic
bitter
taste
was
bitter
and
astringent
with
a
very
small
amount
of
banana
aftertaste
felt
watery
in
the
mouth
along
with
extra
amounts
of
carbonation
not
easy
drinking
and
the
abv
definitely
hit
stronger
than
it
should
have
for
glutenfree
beers
this
is
probably
the
cream
of
the
crop
interesting
and
somewhat
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
poor
and
this
is
not
drinkable
overall
im
sure
if
i
had
celiac
disease
id
be
glad
to
be
able
to
drink
beer
at
all
so
perhaps
i
shouldnt
expect
too
much
from
the
endeavour
dubbel
it
pours
a
mahogany
brown
with
glistening
ruby
red
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
about
two
fingers
thick
and
quite
puffy
the
aroma
is
a
powerful
blast
of
darker
malts
and
sorghum
syrup
medium
mouthfeel
after
the
impressive
first
glance
and
whiff
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
letdown
with
chocolate
hops
and
wheat
and
the
obvious
stench
of
alcohol
it
leaves
a
bit
of
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
i
cant
its
just
not
good
at
all
edit
drain
poured
it
the
taste
is
umm
sweet
to
the
max
mixed
in
with
a
lime
soda
like
tartness
wow
so
this
is
what
gluten
free
does
for
a
beer
umm
no
thanks
its
thin
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
for
me
is
almost
totally
undrinkable
no
way
im
going
to
finish
the
bottle
d
not
so
much
im
afraid
will
steer
clear
of
this
one
it
has
a
strong
malty
and
alcohol
like
aroma
it
has
a
fruity
liquor
smell
to
it
as
well
that
is
a
little
roasty
the
head
starts
off
even
and
beautiful
but
quickly
becomes
foam
there
is
a
lot
of
crazy
lace
it
has
a
dark
brown
body
with
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
and
little
bit
of
a
reddish
hue
it
has
sort
of
an
odd
sweet
melon
taste
with
strong
alcohol
tones
there
is
a
mild
metallic
and
roasty
aftertaste
there
is
not
much
for
body
just
not
something
id
ever
want
to
drink
i
think
that
folks
with
a
gluten
intolerance
can
do
much
better
than
this
avoid
it
its
hard
to
believe
that
glutenfree
beer
has
to
be
this
bad
i
sure
do
feel
for
anyone
who
has
to
drink
this
stuff
truthfully
if
left
no
other
choice
id
do
without
bottom
line
less
than
one
and
done
for
me
pours
brownblack
with
a
fizzy
sodalike
head
that
leaves
a
thin
patchy
film
it
smells
of
sulphur
molases
maybe
with
a
bit
of
raisins
in
the
background
taste
is
metallic
bitter
sour
and
not
good
it
goes
through
a
phase
where
it
almost
has
a
fruity
sweetness
then
it
descends
into
a
medicinal
esters
finish
that
devolves
into
burnt
metal
finish
im
not
sure
if
you
can
burn
metal
but
i
think
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
ok
on
carbonation
but
i
really
cant
focus
on
anything
past
the
taste
not
drinkable
sorry
i
admire
their
creation
of
a
beer
for
the
glutenallergic
and
i
admire
their
effort
to
do
it
in
a
belgian
style
im
just
glad
im
glutenok
not
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
will
finish
this
bottle
but
will
not
seek
it
out
again
d
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
low
alcohol
but
not
very
exciting
in
flavor
profile
bottle
poured
a
deep
pitchbrown
ale
with
a
light
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
no

aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
some
distinguishable
alcohol
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
overly
sweet
malt
which
are
kind
of
gross
with
some
hot
alcohol
ester
light
body
with
average
carbonation
no
subtlety
or
complexity
and
not
something
i
am
looking
for
ever
drinking
again
is
it
better
than
your
other
gluten
free
options
probably
is
it
better
to
the
tune
of
probably
34x
the
cost
of
your
other
options
i
dont
think
so
give
it
a
shot
if
youre
missing
belgians
but
their
blonde
tripel
is
better
man
am
i
glad
im
not
forced
to
drink
gluten
free
beers
all
the
time
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
its
not
terrible
but
it
doesnt
exactly
meet
the
usual
belgian
dubbel
ale
standards
average
drinkability
here
because
in
my
opinion
ive
had
worse
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
except
those
of
you
who
are
seeking
something
totally
different
that
what
youre
used
to
this
beer
will
satisfy
that
craving
if
nothing
else
taste
is
very
sour
and
tart
sour
grape
fruits
and
berries
some
cocoa
licorice
malt
slightly
bitter
for
any
of
my
celiac
brethren
out
there
at
least
the
looks
is
appealing
forms
a
large
thicket
of
light
tan
head
that
dwindles
at
a
decently
quick
pace
body
is
ruddy
with
deep
amber
highlights
lacing
is
apparent
although
not
evenly
strung
aroma
is
very
vinous
in
nature
and
label
says
this
one
is
good
until
050509
thats
awesome
i
know
its
7
but
that
doesnt
scream
that
the
beer
should
last
smells
deep
like
a
red
wine
mild
peppery
feel
with
grape
peels
after
being
aged
on
barrels
spicy
belgian
yeast
strain
touch
of
raisin

apple
tartness
as
well
flavor

grape

red

flavors
a
decent
amount
of
acidity
can
be
noted
here
as
well
im
not
getting
much
hop
flavor
definitely
a
hybrid
belgian
styled
dubbel
i
admire
the
creativity
and
i
will
confess
this
is
not
bad
at
all
definitely
drinkable
i
will
have
to
compare
it
to
the
red
bridge
brew
tomorrow
the
last
gluten
free
beer
i
had
was
utter
shit
yep
that
brew
was
the
passover
honey
beer
from
ramapoo
valley
you
would
have
thought
they
could
have
pulled
of
some
wine
like
flavors
in
their
version
of
a
gluten
free
beer
but
sadly
that
wasnt
the
case
mouthfeel
does
sit
a
bit
heavy
some
shades
of
cloying
sweetness
and
acidic
dryness
with
grape
tartness
and
yeast
cake
powder
notes
i
will
definitely
pass
this
one
on
to
celiac
patients
as
a
nurse
i
run
into
this
disease
pretty
frequently
this
brew
will
have
to
get
my
approval
as
reccomendations
for
alternative
brews
that
these
poor
folks
can
go
for
gigantic
brown
head
towered
over
the
brew
even
after
i
tried
to
pour
it
carefully
settled
down
to
a
chunky
head
that
laced
my
glass
intermittently
the
color
is
a
deep
brown
like
the
bottle
aromas
are
strange
candy
sugar
and
packing
plastic
flavors
are
equally
unpleasant
for
an
all
natural
beer
it
tastes
awfully
unnatural
and
astringent
plastic
again
alcohol
vinegar
the
mouthfeel
is
also
off
thin
for
a
dubbel
the
color
i
really
the
only
thing
right
about
this
beer
i
expected
much
much
more
from
a
belgian
while
i
liked
this
beer
i
must
issue
a
warning
it
is
not
like
any
dubbel
ive
ever
had
before
and
i
doubt
it
really
fits
under
that
style
what
it
really
is
and
not
a
bad
one
is
a
decent
cross
between
a
flanders
red
and
an
unblended
lambic
if
you
like
naturally
fermented
beers
with
a
strong
winelike
quality
give
it
a
try
i
dont
know
what
the
brewers
intended
with
this
beer
but
thats
what
they
achieved
if
youre
not
fond
of
those
styles
avoid
it
poured
into
a
chalice
with
an
aggressive
pour
got
a
one
finger
thick
tan
head
that
was
very
fluffy
but
it
quickly
thinned
out
and
with
little
lacing
this
is
a
dark
brown
beer
with
hints
of
red
hues
and
some
very
active
carbonation
it
has
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
to
it
some
cranberries
and
lemon
zest
soy
sauce
too
just
a
weird
sour
and
complex
aroma
it
has
a
medium
body
leaning
on
the
light
mildly
sweet
and
dry
throughout
it
tastes
very
much
like
greens
discovery
not
really
a
dubbel
taste
at
all
it
is
semismooth
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
leaves
a
slightly
smokey
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
will
not
be
buying
it
again
i
have
2
more
greens
beers
in
the
fridge
i
hope
theyre
not
this
bad
aroma
is
fruity
and
more
like
a
brandy
than
a
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
translucent
brown
with
a
beige
head
that
is
thick
but
does
not
stick
around
for
long
flavor
is
rather
like
brandy
or
cider
very
apply
not
like
a
beer
at
all
but
still
tasty
texture
is
exceptionally
smooth
this
hardly
seems
like
a
beer
at
all
but
that
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
a
clear
miss
if
trying
to
imitate
a
belgian
dubbel
unless
your
allergic
to
the
real
stuff
id
avoid
this
flavour
is
also
radically
different
no
raisin
or
plum
notes
no
candi
sugar
nothing
to
make
this
taste
like
a
real
belgian
dubbel
its
not
bad
it
has
a
unique
cereallike
flavour
that
i
find
pleasant
but
its
just
not
a
dubble
flavour
is
wrong
scent
is
wrong
too
much
carbonation
id
have
it
again
but
not
if
i
want
a
dubble
taste
very
medicinalalcoholic
vinegar
green
apple
and
unripe
berries
very
thin
dry
and
astringent
with
a
harsh
sourboozy
finish
not
a
beer
id
recommend
to
anyone
d
ughghgh
unless
you
are
gluten
intolerant
i
do
not
recommend
trying
this
beer
d
this
is
my
first
gluten
free
beer
and
i
am
quite
impressed
i
came
into
it
expecting
something
pretty
bad
based
on
reviews
of
other
gf
beers
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
if
you
can
get
past
the
somewhat
unfortunate
body
the
flavor
is
a
good
imitation
of
a
barley
based
dubbel
and
the
smell
is
so
good
that
it
gives
no
clues
that
the
beer
is
gf
the
best
compliment
i
have
for
this
is
that
i
had
no
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
and
i
even
enjoyed
it
overall
impression
interesting
definitely
different
than
other
gluten
free
beers
ive
tried
not
the
best
but
its
nice
to
see
some
variety
pours
a
three
finger
rocky
light
tan
head
that
goes
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
little
lace
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
opaque
black
color
nose
is
very
slight
spice
flavor
is
sweet
and
sour
orange
and
dark
chocolate
very
smooth
but
something
is
missing
here
hops
more
like
a
fruit
drink
5
95
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
drinkability
i
wouldnt
sample
this
beer
again
as
far
as
gf
beers
go
i
would
probably
steer
clear
of
it
while
i
really
enjoy
all
belgian
styles
i
felt
that
this
beer
missed
the
mark
this
one
was
the
biggest
hope
of
the
bunch
a
merchant
du
vin
rep
told
me
that
it
was
the
best
of
the
three
and
that
it
relied
heavily
on
caramelized
sugar
for
its
dubbel
character
the
color
was
encouraging
and
the
aroma
was
not
unlike
some
standard
dubbles
with
the
fruity
estery
yeasty
sweet
nose
but
then
crash
it
all
went
to
hell
in
my
mouth
too
much
thin
phenolic
sweetness
the
sugar
was
almost
all
that
revealed
itself
aside
from
lightning
flashes
of
fruit
and
malt
flavor
that
appeared
and
disappeared
so
fast
that
my
repeated
sips
to
catch
this
elusive
flavor
only
amplified
my
disillusionment
imagine
that
the
only
somewhat
satisfying
glutenfree
beer
most
people
tell
me
they
like
is
made
by
ab
what
an
ironic
fate
5
99
per
halfliter
bottle
of
this
stuff
are
you
kidding
me
its
time
for
those
with
gluten
intolerances
that
love
beer
to
quit
waiting
for
the
market
to
find
a
solution
and
start
brewing
up
their
salvation
at
home
a
new
brewline
offered
to
central
kentucky
bas
who
prefer
glutenfree
beers
in
fact
this
beer
fares
much
better
than
any
other
glutenfree
beers
that
i
have
tried
thus
far
starts
wit
a
stable
dubbel
look
solidly
brown
with
some
mohogany
purple
colors
mixed
in
a
loosely
knit
typical
belgian
head
and
retention
and
highly
carbonated
scents
deliver
a
heavy
plumb
grape
apple
estery
quality
along
with
a
sugar
syrup
sweetness
and
a
lot
of
fermenttype
spices
the
tastes
also
deliver
heavy
candied
fruits
found
in
the
aromas
pile
on
a
deep
boozelike
flavor
and
the
brew
takes
on
serious
port
winelike
flavors
mixed
with
mr
pibb
soft
drink
quite
nice
and
flavorful
but
lacks
depth
and
complexity
however
as
with
most
glutenfree
beers
the
body
suffers
the
beer
has
a
light
airiness
that
leaves
the
beer
void
of
texture
and
depth
yet
with
a
whisp
of
pepperiness
finishes
with
a
colalike
flavor
in
the
glass
this
all
natural
dubbel
dark
beer
looked
like
a
champ
a
richlooking
cloudy
brown
it
produced
an
offwhite
head
of
foam
that
lasted
until
the
last
drop
leaving
plenty
of
lacing
to
coat
the
inside
of
my
tripel
karmeliet
glass
unfortunately
those
are
the
last
good
things
i
can
say
about
greens
endeavor
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
asian
grass
jelly
drinks
as
far
as
smells
go
this
one
isnt
particularly
foul
in
fact
it
is
reasonably
pleasant
but
it
is
quite
offputting
when
the
drinker
knows
that
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
belgian
dubbel
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
both
mediocre
at
best
watery
and
tasting
like
an
unsweetened
herbal
soda
more
than
a
beer
the
aftertaste
is
fleeting
but
what
there
is
of
it
is
unpleasantly
medicinal
the
abv
is
listed
at
7
and
ill
give
them
credit
for
hiding
it
well
but
thats
just
lipstick
on
a
pig
and
at
6
for
a
500
ml
bottle
i
will
not
be
getting
a
second
one
nor
will
i
accept
a
freebie
okay
maybe
there
is
one
more
good
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
according
to
the
label
it
does
not
contain
crustaceans
celery
or
sesame
seeds
thats
a
good
thing
right

meditation
beer
i
savored
mine
well
made
the
alcohol
was
present
after
i
polished
this
off
but
not
via
the
taste
and
the
slight
mineral
hardness
of
the
water
was
what
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
once
the
yeast
booze
and
flavors
wore
off
if
it
was
possible
to
brew
a
mountainstyle
beer
without
the
grain
and
with
a
good
european
influence
it
would
taste
a
lot
like
this
not
anything
to
rush
out
and
buy
but
those
looking
for
a
light
dubbel
would
be
wise
to
start
here
there
was
enough
to
like
here
without
an
overriding
sweetness
and
this
stayed
true
to
form
from
start
to
finish
fun
stuff
o
well
constructed
and
easy
to
drink
doesnt
compare
to
the
world
class

but
definitely
worth
a
try

ooverall
great
beer
was
quite
surprised
this
the
first
beer
ive
had
by
bmb
very
impressed
i
wanted
to
put
together
a
virginiaheavy
box
for
a
trade
so
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
with
the
convenient
ulterior
motive
of
being
able
to
try
it
myself
it
pours
a
clear
goldengarnet
theres
a
combination
for
ya
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
belgian
candi
sugar
light
fig
graham
cracker
a
pinch
of
clove
and
an
undercurrent
of
dark
tobacco
the
taste
does
away
with
the
greenery
and
maintains
the
rest
on
cruise
control
theres
an
addition
of
some
extra
clove
and
a
hint
of
banana
peel
as
well
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
a
subpar
dubbel
one
that
lacks
a
lot
of
yeasty
characteristics
i
enjoy
from
the
style
and
one
that
just
comes
across
too
muddled
for
its
own
good
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
persists
a
bit
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
walls
aroma
is
sweet
belgian
candi
sugar
and
maybe
a
hint
of
caramel
fairly
light
on
the
tongue
for
a
dubbel
flavor
is
pleasant
with
sweet
flavors
dominating
from
front
to
back
candi
sugar
maybe
on
the
front
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
on
the
back
o
nice
amounts
of
complexity
and
traditional
dubbel
flavors
are
present
in
this
brew
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
in
most
aspects
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
suggest
that
it
is
worth
trying
for
most
folks
i
like
the
spice
elements
with
the
cinnamon
and
clove
though
i
might
have
detected
a
hint
of
cardamon
but
that
was
really
buried
in
the
aftertaste
and
well
after
i
finished
the
beer
not
bad
a
little
sweet
for
the
style
but
decent
flavors
all
around
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
american
attempt
at
a
complicated
to
duplicate
belgian
style
i
tip
my
hat
to
blue
mountain
i
thought
this
was
quite
impressive
effort
and
well
crafted
o
blue
mountains
evil
8
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
dubbel
style
ale
its
not
a
true
dubbel
but
is
well
worth
your
time
and
effort
a
nice
sixpack
to
pick
up
o
goes
down
easy
very
tasty
somewhat
filling
decent
kick
nice
representation
of
style
not
a
typical
dubbel
and
not
what
i
expected
but
was
surprising
pleased
and
could
have
easily
had
a
few
more
of
these
o
certainly
different
from
any
other
dubbel
that
ive
tried
it
is
not
very
true
to
the
belgianstyle
flavor
profile
the
malts
are
really
darkly
roasted
the
brew
is
generously
hopped
its
like
a
belgian
an
ipa
and
a
stout
had
a
love
child
not
great
by
any
means
but
good
and
worth
checking
out
not
very
drinkable
aftertaste
of
bitter
oatmeal
tastes
worse
the
more
you
drink
pours
a
rich
chestnut
brown
with
minimal
rings
of
offwhite
lacing
scent
is
yeasty
with
notes
of
prune
fig
and
peppery
spice
brown
sugary
sweetness
taste
starts
off
sweet
and
bready
dark
fruits
come
through
along
with
mild
notes
of
roast
finishes
with
a
good
bit
of
peppery
spice
medium
bodied
lightly
coating
sweetness
a
nice
beer
that
differs
from
other
dubbels
in
a
few
different
areas
o
a
very
good
beer
probably
a
better
beer
than
it
is
an
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
taste
is
right
on
for
this
and
i
appreciate
that
they
resisted
adding
too
much
caramely
sweetness
that
seems
to
be
the
achilles
heel
of
american
dubbels
however
they
obviously
do
not
bottle
condition
as
evidenced
by
the
lack
of
yeast
sediment
also
would
appreciate
more
carbonation
to
be
a
true
dubbel
given
these
criticisms
still
a
very
pleasant
beer
and
worthy
of
drinking
more
in
the
future
its
the
best
va
beer
ive
tried
so
far
its
fine
but
heres
me
hoping
that
theres
better
out
there
ogreat
probably
the
pinnacle
of
the
current
blue
mountain
lineup
and
an
excellent
beer
all
around
overall
overall
the
beer
was
a
nice
drinking
beer
with
a
strong
abby
sweet
flavor
to
it
with
a
litter
bit
more
of
a
bitter
flavor
this
beer
could
have
gone
to
a
higher
level
overall
its
a
decent
belgian
style
beer
d
a
nice
belgian
style
dubbel
some
nice
spices
and
dark
fruits
in
the
nose
and
taste
would
have
again
the
evil
8
is
a
fine
dubbel
ale
that
earns
its
best
rating
from
me
for
the
smell
it
smells
lovely
off
the
tap
and
teh
aroma
brings
a
very
satisfying
drinking
experience
that
being
said
i
think
more
than
2
or
3
of
these
in
an
evening
would
be
way
too
much
for
me
the
evil
8
carries
a
light
head
and
laces
a
little
in
the
glass
the
taste
is
certainly
belgian
but
not
too
overwhelming
i
think
it
is
a
good
entry
to
the
world
of
american
made
belgian
style
beers
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
it
at
home
in
the
bottle
as
well
overall
another
winner
from
blue
mountain
totally
drinkable
and
blends
in
the
alcohol
and
malt
profile
beautifully
medium
bodied
with
an
odd
combination
of
flavors
for
the
style
srprisingly
hoppy
with
sme
breadyeast
flavor
that
i
wasnt
expecting
slightly
tartsour
with
a
prominent
dark
fruit
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
hints
of
dark
cherry
plum
raisin
nd
fig
as
well
as
some
candy
sugar
and
alcohol
sweetness
the
odd
bitterness
lingers
throughout
although
it
becomes
less
prominent
toward
the
end
of
the
swallow
when
the
fruit
and
alcohol
flavors
become
evident
theres
also
an
unpleasant
medicinal
cough
syrup
flavor
that
i
find
really
offputting
f
finishes
still
mostly
sweet
a
hint
of
dryness
more
of
the
lingering
bitterness
and
weird
briny
tastes
that
i
cant
really
describe
otherwise
they
both
seem
to
peak
on
the
finish
too
and
overpower
almost
everything
else
not
much
left
in
the
way
of
fruits
but
i
do
get
hints
of
leftover
syrupy
sticky
caramel
molasses
and
candi
sugar
so
okay
not
exactly
a
doppelganger
for
the
real
belgian
dubbel
but
a
cool
american
approximation
all
but
the
most
insane
stylefascists
will
get
something
out
of
this
how
is
it
ive
lived
in
virginia
for
9
years
and
am
just
discovering
this
rather
excellent
brewery
rhetorical
question
people
i
dont
expect
you
to
have
the
answer
i
sure
dont
pours
a
deep
redish
brown
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
fruit
and
some
light
medicinal
notes
tastes
of
thick
roasted
malty
goodness
chocolate
covered
fruit
and
toffee
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
affected
by
the
the
carbonation
i
like
my
dubbels
smoother
but
this
is
a
solid
american
rendition
not
too
shabby
id
drink
it
again
i
do
hope
they
make
some
improvements
though
it
has
a
ton
of
potential
to
be
much
better
bottle
conditioning
might
help

d
not
a
bad
brew
great
interpretation
of
an
earthier
dubbel
d
i
had
this
ontap
at
the
brewery
yesterday
but
liked
this
bottle
more
probably
because
cooler
as
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
bottleconditioned
very
tasty
dubbel
now
that
i
know
they
arent
bottle
conditioned
i
will
dig
in
here
and
there
for
sure
as
this
is
a
nice
treat
a
solid
dark
brown
color
with
a
full
tan
fine
bubbled
head
and
lots
of
lace
the
aroma
is
spiced
apple
cider
with
a
subtle
malt
undercurrent
the
flavor
offers
more
nutmeg
cinnamon
on
top
of
a
crisp
but
malty
apple
cider
base
maybe
a
hint
of
clove
with
burnt
sugar
carmel
its
smooth
a
spritzy
midbodied
brew
pretty
drinkable
and
unique
from
my
experience
there
is
a
biscuit
hop
that
grows
near
the
end
very
enjoyable
another
thanks
to
ohoove
drinkability
while
not
among
the
belgian
greats
for
the
style
this
presents
a
nice
american
hoppy
twist
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
good
pour
a
dark
reddish
muddy
brown
with
a
1
5finger
white
head
that
stayed
forever
and
left
lace
down
the
glass
had
a
strong
yeasty
smell
that
overpowered
a
strong
sweet
malt
presence
caramel
brown
sugar
and
light
fruit
notes
like
orange
a
heavy
malt
taste
like
bread
caramel
syrup
makes
for
a
fuller
sticky
body
that
goes
down
somewhat
chunky
thanks
to
some
spices
and
sour
fruit
tastes
this
is
a
somewhat
hard
beer
to
describe
it
has
all
the
necessary
components
of
a
dubbel
and
is
good
but
not
great
i
enjoyed
it
but
wouldnt
say
its
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
good
nightcap
type
of
beer
very
sweet
though
this
was
solid
nothing
really
earth
shattering
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
did
like
that
this
was
a
little
more
hop
forward
than
you
would
expect
for
the
style
a
pleasant
sipper
d
this
bad
boy
is
heavy
but
light
on
abv
it
is
very
filling
and
one
or
two
of
these
would
be
enough
but
you
wouldnt
be
drunk
id
buy
a
sixer
of
this
for
a
weekend
if
this
is
your
style
then
this
iw
well
well
worth
a
try
drinkability
very
drinkable
its
really
fun
its
not
even
close
to
great
compared
to
really
good
belgian
or
amerobelgian
dubbles
but
its
a
really
cool
interpretation
from
a
brewery
that
likes
hops
so
much
that
they
grow
their
own
another
nice
brew
from
a
nice
brewery
that
im
glad
is
close
to
me
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
though
there
are
some
interesting
malt
and
hop
characteristics
that
are
not
too
common
with
a
dubbel
id
definitely
recommend
this
to
folks
as
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
very
drinkable
if
you
appreciate
a
hops
presence
in
a
dubbel
edit
very
nice
belgian
funky
burps
a
good
representation
of
a
belgian
dubbel
not
the
best
but
a
solid
one
at
that
i
drink
it
again
and
say
it
is
worth
the
try
one
is
enough
at
a
sitting
due
to
the
heat
on
this
one
drinkability
theres
a
more
rougharoundtheedges
aspect
of
this
brew
that
i
just
cant
get
around
its
almost
overhopped
or
there
was
some
kind
of
charred
or
roasted
malt
that
was
used
that
doesnt
seem
to
let
the
seemingly
authentic
belgian
flavor
through
glad
i
only
got
a
single
bottle
overall
maybe
some
age
will
do
something
nicely
crafted
take
on
the
style
well
balanced
and
tasty
without
anything
crazy
going
on
12oz
bottle
forgotten
in
a
beer
box
from
a
previous
trip
to
virginia
poured
into
a
corsendonk
tulip
this
one
pours
a
dark
muddy
brown
that
shows
some
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
beer
is
topped
by
a
nice
frothy
khaki
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
beautiful
lacing
aroma
is
a
great
amount
of
dried
fruits
and
brown
malts
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
molasses
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
dark
malts
dried
fruits
and
spice
with
slight
coffee
and
bitter
cocoa
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
well
hidden
alcohol
this
one
surprised
me
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
unless
the
mood
hits
and
am
especially
not
a
huge
fan
of
american
brewed
ones
but
this
one
was
quite
respectable
single
bottle
from
grape
gourmet
virginia
beach
va
ive
really
been
enjoying
blue
mountains
stuff
since
they
started
making
it
around
the
northern
part
of
the
state
and
look
forward
to
visiting
the
brewery
sometime
in
the
near
future
id
say
this
should
be
at
the
end
of
your
tasting
session
to
keep
from
thrashing
your
taste
buds
nice
aroma
of
floral
and
spice
lets
me
know
it
is
a
belgian
style
but
taste
is
more
malty
and
there
is
plenty
of
bitterness
at
the
end
everything
in
balance
very
drinkable
perhaps
to
much
so
for
the
alcohol
so
is
that
the
evil
part
d
i
enjoy
the
fact
that
this
dubbel
is
more
hoppy
than
the
usual
style
so
for
me
personally
it
goes
down
real
smooth
and
compliments
most
of
my
richer
cuisine
notes
from
22508
pours
a
dark
oily
brown
almost
black
like
exceptionally
rich
coffee
little
in
the
way
of
head
it
has
a
strong
porterlike
malt
backbone
and
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
raisins
and
red
wine
on
the
tongue
it
has
a
light
phenolic
character
and
a
rich
satisfying
mouthfeel
that
grabs
the
tongue
from
start
to
finish
a
very
good
beer
that
would
be
a
perfect
match
with
a
robust
meal
of
beef
or
pork
i
poured
this
nice
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
had
a
hellacious
head
that
was
fluffy
and
tan
the
lacing
was
really
good
as
was
the
smell
though
i
could
not
describe
it
the
taste
was
roasted
and
malty
and
very
nice
i
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
overall
i
felt
this
was
a
nicely
balanced
belgianstyle
dubbel
and
my
hat
is
off
to
brewmaster
taylor
smack
drinability
is
good
its
enjoyable
enough
wouldnt
replace
my
st
bernardus
but
worth
a
shot
in
my
opinion
dnice
representation
of
style
made
with
a
real
trappist
yeast
strain
a
quality
american
version
of
this
belgian
style
drinkability
is
fine
for
what
it
is
its
a
sipper
but
most
dubbels
are
and
although
this
one
isnt
a
standout
example
of
the
style
its
a
good
attempt
d
this
is
a
good
effort
from
this
newcomer
brewery
perhaps
not
quite
as
spectacular
as
their
others
but
still
a
decent
abbeystyle
ale
nonetheless
for
its
class
it
has
quite
the
competition
but
it
comes
out
alright
im
glad
i
got
6
and
look
forward
to
it
again
on
tap
as
well
o
buy
this
one
again
a
nice
drinking
beer
probably
a
good
choice
for
people
who
dont
like
hardcore
craft
beers
not
sure
id
call
this
thing
a
dubbel
though
overall
a
rather
easy
drinking
dubbel
overall
all
in
all
it
is
pretty
good
but
is
noting
too
outrageously
good
it
just
doesnt
have
the
same
ring
to
it
that
the
visuallyimpaired
rodent
trio
does
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
ambergarnet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
rich
caramel
dark
fruits
light
molasses
and
a
bit
of
belgian
candi
sugar
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
some
extra
candi
sugar
a
couple
black
cherries
and
a
twinge
of
green
apple
way
in
the
back
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
a
decent
dubbel
at
best
one
that
just
doesnt
fully
sit
right
with
me
maybe
its
a
bit
sweet
maybe
its
the
fruit
on
the
tongue
im
not
fully
sure
all
i
know
is
that
i
wont
be
demanding
another
any
time
soon
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chimay
glass
pours
a
dark
amber
with
little
head
this
is
the
first
dubbel
that
ive
had
so
im
not
sure
if
its
consistent
with
the
style
smells
of
dark
fruit
and
malt
the
taste
is
the
same
its
a
very
drinkable
got
to
say
i
was
surprise
by
the
beer
wasnt
as
dark
i
thought
it
should
be
but
has
a
great
taste
goes
down
smooth
heavy
in
acl
so
i
wasnt
going
to
drink
a
4
pack
if
i
had
to
get
up
in
the
morning
but
a
good
tasting
beer
smell
of
friut
and
citris
give
it
a
shot
on
a
long
weekend
i
like
it
not
bad
would
recommend
poured
into
a
stem
glass
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
i
actually
inquired
if
i
was
poured
the
correct
beer
because
the
appearance
and
aroma
seemed
very
deviant
from
a
typical
dubbel
aroma
rich
with
caramel
molasses
and
cocoa
taste
was
well
really
good
actually
though
totally
not
what
i
expected
rich
and
velvety
smooth
with
dark
malts
and
chocolate
up
front
almost
reminiscent
of
a
sweet
stout
mellowing
out
midpalate
to
reveal
more
of
the
molasses
and
sweet
dark
sugars
present
in
the
aroma
with
touches
of
bready
yeast
cherries
and
plums
surprisingly
complex
and
very
tasty
mediumbodied
and
very
drinkable
my
friend
who
was
with
me
ended
up
ordering
3
in
a
row
and
i
wouldve
done
the
same
but
i
like
to
diversify
when
im
at
the
bar
bottle
poured
a
deep
hazy
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
caramelized
sugar
with
very
subtle
fruity
ester
is
ok
taste
is
overly
sweet
for
style
with
notes
of
caramelized
sugar
and
light
dry
fruits
with
some
notes
of
fruity
ester
body
is
quite
full
with
ok
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
this
one
is
kind
of
average
for
the
style
but
definitely
lacking
some
of
the
subtlety
that
makes
dubbel
such
a
great
style
to
being
with
the
two
blind
monks
ale
was
medium
amber
in
color
a
little
malty
at
7
0
abv
a
little
tart
from
the
yeast
a
little
residual
sweetness
from
the
belgian
candy
sugar
very
interesting
this
is
a
good
beer
for
any
season
and
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
hazy
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
banana
yeast
taste
is
good
lots
of
fruits
some
spice
a
bit
malty
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
worth
seeking
out
o
solid
beer
a
classic
representation
of
the
style
nothing
too
special
but
not
one
to
turn
down
either
the
7
0
abv
is
well
hidden
and
this
is
drinkable
brew
just
wish
it
stood
out
form
the
crowd
a
little
more
i
could
have
easily
had
another
one
of
these
after
i
finished
this
since
it
was
that
mellow
this
isnt
a
session
beer
but
for
someone
whos
never
had
a
belgian
beer
before
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
a
dubbel
no
spice
here
means
that
this
is
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
and
certainly
a
step
up
from
the
previous
boaks
beer
that
i
had
nice
to
see
new
jersey
finally
toss
their
hat
into
the
ring
in
brewing
this
style
mthin
and
very
little
carination
make
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
wish
there
was
more
intense
flavor
from
belgian
yeast
good
beer
and
well
made
happy
to
support
a
local
brewery
especially
one
that
makes
so
many
great
beers
cheers
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
too
interesting
but
it
was
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
it
sort
of
tasted
more
along
the
lines
of
a
brown
ale
overall
this
beer
struck
me
more
as
an
american
amber
than
a
dubble
worth
trying
but
not
worth
seeking
out
d
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
that
i
feel
like
im
drinking
sweetened
liquid
pennies
this
wouldnt
be
such
a
disappointment
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
ive
had
this
once
before
on
tap
and
found
it
to
be
drinkable
yet
unremarkable
but
this
time
around
it
has
a
mildly
offensive
finish
d
the
flavors
were
good
but
the
high
amount
of
dryness
will
likely
keep
me
from
trying
this
again
d
this
is
a
solid
dubbel
belgians
not
really
my
bag
but
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
d
a
bit
gassy
which
may
limit
multiples
distinctly
malty
and
yeasty
providing
a
full
drinking
experience
where
one
should
be
enough
to
fill
you
up
and
satisfy
this
is
a
pretty
solid
dubbel
here
from
boaks
interesting
smokiness
going
on
in
this
beer
which
for
the
style
is
probably
a
lovehate
kind
of
thing
i
think
its
interesting
and
overall
pretty
good
no
not
really
its
not
great
its
not
a
particularly
inspiring
dubbel
but
its
not
awful
overall
decent
but
not
worth
12
and
change
i
paid
for
a
fourpack
d
a
bit
heavy
but
a
decent
belgian
beer
for
an
american
brewery
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
spicy
sweet
dry
and
yeasty
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
is
clear
amber
in
color
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
very
estery
up
front
it
finishes
very
spicey
it
is
medium
in
body
and
well
carbonated
the
styles
are
kinda
mashed
up
imo
this
is
a
tripledubbel
that
does
not
work
for
me
d
unfortunately
i
cannot
say
i
will
be
picking
up
any
more
of
this
i
did
use
one
of
the
six
pack
in
a
splitpea
soup
and
it
did
enhance
the
flavor
a
bit
there
overall
a
decent
american
dubbel
overall
it
is
a
shame
this
is
a
hometown
brewery
for
me
and
i
have
liked
what
i
have
tried
in
the
past
this
one
was
just
a
mess
though
i
would
avoid
overall
a
good
example
of
a
dubbel
pours
dark
dark
brown
that
looks
deep
copper
when
held
up
to
light
there
is
a
small
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
only
hints
of
lacing
aroma
has
sweet
candied
sugar
and
caramel
malts
on
top
of
the
belgian
yeast
backbone
dark
fruits
come
through
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
lots
of
yeast
and
sweet
caramel
malts
candied
sugar
figs
and
raisins
also
come
out
in
the
flavor
odd
sour
taste
that
i
wasnt
expecting
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
with
the
sweetness
and
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
representation
of
a
dubbel
and
quite
enjoyable
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
mahogany
brown
with
a
big
offwhite
head
but
spotty
lace
the
aroma
included
maple
syrup
molasses
black
cherry
and
blackberry
the
taste
certainly
featured
dark
fruit
but
also
included
dark
chocolatecocoa
and
dissolved
into
a
tartsweet
finish
overall
fairly
impressive
flavor
variety
but
the
feel
was
surprisingly
thin
for
a
dubbel
however
the
thin
body
makes
for
a
good
session
dubbel
if
such
a
thing
exists
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
maredsous
chalice
the
dubbel
appeared
a
murky
deep
chestnut
color
with
about
an
inch
of
quickly
fading
of
white
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
dark
fruits
such
as
figs
dates
and
raisins
quite
sweet
with
notes
of
candi
sugar
molasses
yeast
some
caramel
hovering
above
medium
bodied
and
adequately
carbonated
slightly
above
average
across
the
board
imo
it
was
a
good
take
on
a
belgian
dubbel
but
i
dont
think
the
taste
should
have
been
so
dry
the
fruits
were
good
but
that
dryness
has
to
be
lowered
i
think
a
six
pack
of
this
would
be
too
much
but
a
single
or
two
would
be
good
enough

is
mellow
at

some
sweetness
there
and
plenty
of
carbonation
despite
the
lack

almost
a

im
on
the

with
this
one
something
is
missing

wise
not
sure
if
its
too
much
carbonation
on
the
palette
or
if
it
needs
to
tone
down
maybe
tweak
the
yeast
a
bit
has
more
of
a
german
bock
mouth
feel
to
it
than
belgian
alewhich
i
think
is
what
was
implied
notes
i
didnt
bother
to
finish
the
beer
next
to
a
solid
traditional
dubbel
this
beer
really
doesnt
compare
plenty
of
other
beers
to
spend
my
money
on
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
others
unless
you
are
looking
for
a
good
beer
for
a
beer
pong
tournament
i
have
no
trouble
drinking
this
beer
but
since
i
have
a
case
of
it
i
think
i
will
let
the
remaining
bottles
hang
out
in
the
keller
and
try
it
again
in
a
few
months
poured
a
really
nice
copperlight
brown
with
a
darker
brown
center
the
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
and
malt
and
taste
pretty
much
follows
suit
although
with
a
bit
of
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
easy
drinkability
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
its
beautiful
appearance
in
the
glass
a
chestnut
colored
thin
layer
of

quite
clear

quite

a

you
might

from

it

this

the

yielded

pretty

actually
kind
of

whatever
its

i
guess
at

try
it
once
kind
of
tastes
like
a
weird

your

might

you
it
could

it

now
lets
talk
about
the
branding
it
sucks
the
packaging
at
first
glance
gives
the
impression
of
a
cider
or
light
beer
the
name
suggests
a
genetic
abnormality
but
it
is
an
organic
beer
the
whole
branding
is
an
oxymoron
so
maybe
this
is
a
hipster
beer
and
intended
to
be
ironic
either
way
it
is
worth
a
try
im
glad
i
tried
this
different
take
on
a
dubbel
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
especially
during
the
summer
months
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
that
seems
to
fit
the
style
well
crazy
beer
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
picking
out
spices
and
like
the
belgian
malt
liquor
vibes
uncommon
brewers
is
right
this
is
a
terribly
interesting
take
on
a
classic
belgian
style
who
knows
how
the
monks
would
feel
about
this
twist
but
i
say
hear
hear
though
far
from
an
outstanding
offering
in
many
ways
siamese

full
which
was
a

an

a
suppose
but
a

watery
and
a
little
boring
i
expected
more
flash
from
all
the

advertised
on
the

can

that
this

is
made

a
b
grade
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
dubbels
and
siamese
twin
ale
hasnt
really
altered
my
opinion
much
the
kaffir
lime
leaves
and
lemongrass
compensate
somewhat
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
just
too
sweet
and
boozy
to
be
something
i
want
to
consume
very
much
of
in
fact
this
tallboy
is
probably
a
little
excessive
that
being
said
it
still
tastes
quite
good
and
this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
might
be
worth
a
look
if
youre
into
belgianspiced
ale
hybrids
still
ill
be
happy
to
stick
with
chimay
red
the
next
time
i
have
a
dubbel
craving
a
creative
passable
selection
for
my
500th
review
on
ba
cheers
to
500
more
i
wouldnt
want
to
keep
this
as
my
right
hand
but
its
not
bad
at
all
a
unique
adaptation
of
the
style
and
it
works
the
lime
and
lemongrass
add
a
nice
dimension
worth
trying
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
in
the
future
first
sip
is
bomb
of
sweet
sugary
malts
molasses
and
toffee
flavors
dominate
but
it
is
cloyingly
sweet
lime
coriander
and
lemongrass
all
take
a
back
seat
credit
for
trying
something
out
of
the
ordinary
but
this
misses
the
mark
with
me
too
sweet
and
not
refreshing
not
my
favorite
but
still
very
interesting
uncommon
brewers
does
an
excellent
job
of
putting
interesting
twists
on
old
styles
might
grab
one
more
for
the
cellar
an
rereview
later
o
a
high
quality
base
dubbel
regardless
of
the
unusual
additions
the
lemongrass
and
lime
are
either
so
well
or
so
lightly
used
that
its
tough
to
pick
them
out
but
a
nice
background
contributor
expected
a
gimmick
but
found
a
really
nice
beer
pours
nice
and
toasted
brown
with
some
central
light
etching
smells
of
lime
some
sweet
syrups
a
little
bit
of
belgian
yeasts
some
coriander
and
the
lemon
grass
taste
is
lightly
tart
some
alcohol
some
bitterness
some
candy
medium
on
full
body
with
hi
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
not
a
good
beer
really
yes
this
was
strong
but
it
never
tasted
that
way
while
i
was
enjoying
this
while
the
spice
wasnt
as
present
here
as
in
other
beers
that
ive
had
of
this
style
a
little
ginger
would
have
provided
a
nice
kick
to
this
regardless
this
was
a
different
take
on
a
dubbel
that
worked
well
and
was
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
its
nice
to
see
the
envelope
pushed
on
this
and
uncommon
did
it
well
to
the
point
where
this
may
end
up
being
popular
enough
to
prove
the
brewers
name
to
be
an
oxymoron
of
sorts
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
brown
color
its
got
an
interesting
yellowish
colored
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
spicy
citrus
notes
there
is
some
caramel
and
even
some
booze
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
dark
fruit
flavor
with
some
caramel
in
there
as
it
warms
up
the
flavors
become
more
earthy
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
interestingly
soft
carbonation
dry
finish
too
overall
this
beer
is
decent
not
my
favorite
dubbel
o
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
although
it
is
not
as
sweet
and
complex
compared
to
other
dubbels
o
enjoyable
with
the
addition
of
the
thai
spicesherbs
but
the
alcohol
is
just
not
well
enough
hidden
for
me
not
sure
i
would
get
this
one
again
as
it
deviates
a
little
too
much
from
the
traditional
dubbel
style
for
me
this
beer
smells
like
hairspray
im
sure
there
is
some
very
technical
term
that
would
impress
everyone
but
hey
i
dont
know
it
anyways
this
doesnt
really
work
for
me
i
could
have
done
without
it
unfortunately
that
seems
to
be
the
theme
for
this
brewery
for
me
yep
weird
sums
up
this
beer
quite
well
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
fairly
mild
and
is
of
malt
asian
peanut
sauce
and
some
herbal
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
peanuts
and
some
herbal
and
citrus
flavors
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
flavor
wise
but
there
are
some
odd
aromas
coming
from
this
one
an
impressive
dubbel
in
the
sense
of
those
new
world
flunkies
having
a
bit
of
fun
and
um
innovation
with
the
style
the
specified
adjuncts
add
their
own
subtle
intricacies
to
a
one
and
the
overall
toastiness
does
well
to
rein
in
any
overly
saccharine
tendencies
no
booze
makes
itself
known
which
is
an
achievement
on
its
own
quite
enjoyable
and
worthy
of
seeking
out
another
another
can
offering
from
these
guys
this
makes
number
three
with
one
hit
and
one
miss
so
far
and
love
the
list
of
added
ingredients
anyway
it
pours
a
hazy
copper
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
head
that
stays
and
nice
lacingthe
smell
is
belgian
candyaniseedhumbugscinamonnutmeg
and
herbal
hopsthe
mouthfeel
is

and
finished
with

and

its
nice
and
bittersweet
with
a
belgianthai
flair
but
as
they
state
its
an
uncommon
brew
and
not
that
true
to
style
but
would
be
nice
with
a
spicy
asian
meal
or
indian
curry
cheers
some
time
might
make
this
one
even
better
i
didnt
expect
much
from
a
dubbel
in
a
pint
can
but
it
worked
for
me
and
once
again
im
well
above
the
average
c
overall
rating
is
quite
high
i
love
that
this
beer
of
such
high
complexity
is
available
in
a
can
d
very
drinkable
nice
balance
of
dark
sweet
flavors
spices
and
body
i
like
the
lemongrass
and
the
kaffir
lime
wow
what
a
mouthful
of
unexpected
flavors
this
is
technically
a
dubbel
in
that
it
more
or
less
looks
like
a
dubbelnice
ruddy
brownishred
colorand
is
strong
like
a
dubbel
but
beyond
that
this
is
an
entirely
different
beast
the
nose
has
recognizable
belgian
yeast
aromas
but
there
is
a
ton
of
exotic
spice
in
there
as
well
the
palate
is
a
whole
other
adventure
the
thai
flavors
actually
work
surprisingly
well
with
the
belgian
yeast
its
like
a
ripe
funky
slightly
savory
tropical
fruit
salad
delicious
very
rich
syrupy
malt
dominated
palate
heavily
toasted
and
lightly
roasted
with
just
a
hint
of
coffee
theres
maybe
a
hint
of
something
herbal
but
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
tell
that
there
was
coriander
lemongrass
or
lim
leaves
in
this
brew
unless
told
fruity
and
yeasty
on
the
finish
and
linger
well
integrated
abv
heat
poured
from
a
can
into
my
trusty
snifter
the
appearance
was
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
moderate
head
erupting
toward
the
top
of
the
glass
the
belgian
notes
are
the
most
apparent
characteristic
in
the
aroma
which
gives
an
understated
impression
before
the
taste
the
initial
taste
is
somewhat
spicy
or
peppery
with
notes
of
corriander
and
pleasant
lime
hints
that
nibble
at
the
sour
taste
buds
on
the
tongue
thankfully
the
lime
is
realistic
unlike
the
lime
flavoring
in
certain
macrobrews
all
of
these
unusual
traits
are
set
against
a
malty
backbone
the
unusual
flavors
in
this
beer
along
with
a
thinner
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
an
odd
impression
of
the
style
yet
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
creates
an
enjoyable
experience
overall
the
beer
is
quite
good
and
i
was
very
thankful
to
find
that
the
strange
kaffir
lime
leaf
lemongrass
and
coriander
additions
worked
well
with
the
brew
meshing
nicely
with
the
malts
and
hops
and
providing
new
and
funky
layers
of
sugar
and
peppery
spice
instead
of
overwhelming
it
recommended
and
excellent
light
fare
for
a
hot
day
overall
this
is
an
ok
dubbel
not
sure
if
its
something
id
seek
out
again
personally
though
o
damn
impressive
i
dug
the
not
traditionally
canned
style
that
they
chose
to
release
ill
keep
my
eyes
on
these
guys
o
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
i
thought
the
nose
was
a
bit
metalic
the
taste
was
a
little
too
sweet
and
the
body
was
a
little
too
carbonated
overall
not
a
great
beer
and
something
i
wouldnt
seek
out
again
or
recommend
drinkability
this
is
a
sipping
beer
not
one
id
want
for
a
session
beer
two
would
be
tops
for
me
while
easy
to
drink
and
having
a
good
price
point
the
beer
suffered
from
some
deficiencies
not
least
of
which
was
that
it
didnt
taste
much
like
a
dubbel
its
described
as
unique
and
uncommon
and
ill
give
them
that
and
points
for
creating
an
original
brew
but
i
doubt
that
ill
buy
it
again
it
just
wasnt
that
outstanding

its

for

brown
sugar
dark

and
some
lemongrass
it
tastes
like
caramel
and
bready
malt
lemongrass
lime
coriander
herbs
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
theres
also
a
lingering
bittersweet
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
sticky
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
this
is
an
interesting
brew
i
liked
it
its
worth
a
try
im
pretty
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
was
excited
when
i
found
a
store
selling
single
cans
of
it
because
i
was
unwilling
to
buy
a
4pack
of
it
where
i
normally
buy
all
my
beer
unique
and
uncommon
indeed
i
give
them
credit
for
an
original
brew
but
this
is
not
something
i
would
choose
to
buy
again
admittedly
im
not
a
big
belgian
fan
but
i
like
interesting
ingredients
i
really
wanted
to
be
able
to
give
this
one
an
a
based
on
concept
alone
but
it
just
falls
a
bit
short
a
bit
sweet
a
bit
cloying
a
bit
muddled
and
kind
of
murky
but
still
interesting
and
pretty
damn
drinkable
given
everything
ill
probably
drink
another
one
or
two
o
uncommon
yes
different
yes
great
not
really
more
toward
good
i
would
say
at
a
minimum
give
this
a
try
i
dont
know
maybe
this
beer
was
kept
in
a
hot
warehouse
for
a
month
or
something
went
wrong
between
santa
cruz
and
pennsylvania
but
i
dont
enjoy
it
theres
an
odd
grassy
not
like
hops
caramel
taste
theres
a
hint
of
the
kaffir
lime
thats
added
i
can
pull
out
of
the
aftertaste
but
thats
one
of
the
few
bright
spots
frankly
this
smells
a
bit
like
an
indian
buffet
with
the
coriander
and
lemongrass
additions
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
but
i
dont
want
another
can
overall
ok
beer
a
little
thick
and
sweet
not
nessasarily
my
cup
of
tea
3
55
really
a
pretty
good
beer
its
just
out
of
control
bludgeons
whatever
the
base
beer
is
into
a
quaking
unset
jelly
nice
effort
id
rather
brewers
went
too
far
than
made
another
bland
pale
or
ipa
id
try
another
from
them
medium
body
the
alcohol
isnt
as
evident
as
i
expected
based
on
the
smell
good
carbonation
i
could
of
handled
more
lime
i
think
not
enough
quality
lime
beers
out
there
dont
be
shy
edit
while
cleaning
out
the
can
i
noticed
the
packaged
on
sticker
on
the
bottom
of
the
can
saying
it
was
packaged
on
3192010
this
would
make
it
10
months
old
tomorrow
not
sure
i
would
have
bought
it
had
i
noticed
that
when
buying
it
overall
this
drinks
smoothly
and
tastes
pretty
good
it
isnt
something
i
would
want
every
day
but
i
would
have
it
again
darker
than
expected
and
very
cloudy
a
solid
brick
redcinnamon
with
very
little
head
to
speak
of
not
particularly
nice
for
a
dubbel
the
aroma
is
intriguing
appropriately
fruity
and
tinged
with
thai
spices
the
fusion
seems
to
work
at
least
in
the
nose
lychee
sweetness
and
delicate
malty
notes
of
muscovado
sugar
and
honey
combine
with
banana
and
bubblegum
yeast
to
create
a
nice
foundation
for
the
kaffir
lime
lemongrass
and
coriander
there
is
a
hint
of
orange
soda
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
subtle
and
quite
tasty
more
belgian
than
thai
but
thats
probably
a
good
thing
the
coriander
accentuates
the
earthy
spiciness
of
the
yeast
while
the
kaffir
lime
and
lemongrass
wed
nicely
to
the
natural
fruity
and
citric
flavors
from
the
hops
a
bit
thin
overall
stronger
than
it
needs
to
be
and
a
bit
vague
but
in
general
a
successful
and
tasty
experiment
medium
bodied
creamy
mid
level
carbonation
a
little
dryness
pretty
smooth
drinking
and
the
flavors
all
seem
to
work
fairly
well
despite
my
initial
skepticism
although
it
was
a
little
sweet
towards
the
end
this
is
definitely
an
uncommon
beer
roughly
medium
bodied
beer
hid
its
alcohol
nicely
to
make
the
beer
nicely
drinkable
d
really
damn
good
beer
and
not
a
trace
of
alcohol
the
only
thing
that
might
prevent
me
from
having
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
row
is
the
fruity
sweetness
it
may
get
to
be
too
much
however
the
one
and
only
i
have
is
going
to
be
very
much
enjoyed
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
light
brownamber
color
with
about
3
fingers
of
foamy
light
brown
very
quickly
dissipating
head
smells
like
belgian
yeast
maybe
some
spice
and
chocolate
taste
and
heres
where
it
gets
weird
definitely
a
sourish
lemony
something
spice
a
medium
light
hop
bitterness
and
i
dont
know
what
i
guess
probably
the
kaffir
lime
puckering
my
mouth
nice
light
crisp
bubbles
very
drinkable
for
8
5
but
then
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
another
i
very
much
like
how
different
this
is
but
i
dont
know
if
i
actually
like
it
get
back
to
you
on
that
one
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
for
me
the
flavors
just
did
not
work
all
that
well
together
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
d
hmmm
im
a
fan
of
curious
beers
ones
where
brewers
push
boundaries
and
craft
originality
in
whatever
they
brew
this
one
has
successes
and
shortcomings
while
i
think
the
introduction
of
asian
ingredients
is
an
intriguing
concept
they
twist
the
dubbel
that
i
know
and
enjoy
in
a
way
that
i
dont
think
i
need
to
have
again
a
try
or
two
is
fine
but
ultimately
im
not
sold
on
the
repeated
drinkability
of
this
experiment
uncommon
oh
hell
yeah
just
not
as
enjoyable
as
id
hoped
but
it
did
start
growing
on
me
and
with
warming
things
began
coalescing
a
little
better
still
every
now
and
then
my
palate
was
rocked
by
the
odd
ingredients
just
as
i
was
starting
to
decipher
and
feel
the
dubbelness
of
this
thing
ultimately
even
though
i
might
never
crave
another
its
hard
to
dislike
when
i
know
ill
remember
the
flavor
forever
theres
no
other
beer
out
there
like
this
one
as
far
as
i
know
edit
21913
had
this
again
not
sure
why
its
listed
here
as
dubbel
but
whatevs
i
found
the
blend
of
flavors
and
spices
here
to
really
be
a
weird
mess
the
body
had
a
sharp
harsh
bite
at
the
back
it
wasnt
an
easy
beer
to
drink
i
suggest
avoiding
this
one
a
gift
from
my
friend
marty
another
canned
beer
and
one
that
i
had
never
heard
of
pouring
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
results
in
a
cloudy
orangebrown
pour
with
merely
a
suggestion
of
light
tan
foam
an
interesting
nose
on
this
one
though
not
unexpected
after
reading
the
can
lemon
lime
belgian
spices
on
the
palate
i
get
a
little
of
that
citrus
along
with
yeast
bready
malt
and
some
caramel
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
d
refreshing
yes
but
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
due
to
the
strong
flavors
and
syrupy
finish
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
wanted
a
nice
flavorful
hot
weather
sipper
taste
of
strong
belgian
yeast
lime
is
pretty
strong
on
a
level
by
itself
i
would
say
kaffir
lime
is
strangely
similar
to
a
chemical
lime
i
have
tasted
in
the
past
although
just
entirely
coincidental
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
relatively
light
carbonation
coriander
and
lemongrass
also
make
this
a
little
bit
of
a
sipper
the
flavors
go
together
well
and
would
probably
be
tasty
even
on
a
hot
day
although
i
usually
do
not
think
of
a
dubbel
as
a
brew
i
would
be
sipping
out
on
a
beach
etc
maybe
i
should
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
lemon
and
lime
with
some
sugar
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
lime
with
caramel
malt
lemon
and
some
sweeter
dark
fruit
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
twist
on
a
dubbel
while
i
cant
really
say
that
this
absolutley
worked
for
me
i
do
have
to
give
props
on
the
innovative
angle
these
guys
took
on
a
belgianstyle
dubbel
just
a
bit
too
much
going
on
with
the
spices
here
and
i
wish
that
this
had
held
the
alcohol
in
check
just
a
bit
more
as
well
i
will
say
that
this
does
make
me
interested
in
trying
some
more
offerings
from
these
guys
uncommon
indeed
d
one
per
session
is
enough
for
me
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
the
flavor
profile
and
the
abv
hold
this
one
back
a
bit
for
me
d
just
okay
too
much
going
on
everything
seems
to
be
a
bit
in
excess
too
much
lime
too
much
spice
too
much
booze
in
the
finish
ehh
not
the
most
memorable
beer
ive
had
the
overall
flavor
isnt
doing
the
trick
and
it
seems
a
little
thin
and
overspiced
in
the
mouth
maybe
dubbels
arent
ideal
to
have
added
spices
d
im
not
entirely
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
the
brewers
have
certainly
lived
up
to
their
moniker
uncommon
and
its
an
interesting
twist
on
a
classic
style
notes
i
really
liked
this
beer
unique
but
not
strange
and
very
very
drinkable
you
have
to
love
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
so
outside
the
box
on
packaging
and
complexity
but
manages
to
be
a
solid
beer
and
a
classic
representation
of
the
style
in
the
end
it
poured
flat
but
no
worries
kind
of
like
a
hand
pump
the
beer
shows
its
true
flavors
taste
was
rustic
and
sweet
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
not
overpowering
drinkabilitywise
i
would
recommend
this
and
say
you
could
get
into
some
serious
trouble
sipping
on
these
at
a
raider
tailgate
smooth
and
highbooze
bad
combo
but
very
good
have
to
break
this
head
up
so
i
can
taste
it
beer
has
a
slight
metallic
taste
to
it
overall
the
beer
is
sweet
and
has
nice
malt
character
has
the
nice
belgian
yeast
spiciness
that
is
associated
with
belgian
ales
second
taste
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
thats
unfortunate
beer
is
a
little
thin
no
real
bitterness
drinkability
moderate
hurt
by
alcohol
flavor
its
a
decent
beer
siamese
twin
ale
is
a
fascinating
and
uncommonly
delicious
ale
that
adheres
to
the
belgian
brewing
tradition
of
adding
all
sorts
of
interesting
ingredients
to
beer
it
works
out
well
in
the
end
which
is
the
only
thing
that
matters
id
love
to
lay
my
hands
on
some
more
canned
goods
from
uncommon
brewers
d
im
not
quick
to
write
these
guys
off
because
they
obviously
have
some
mad
scientist
tendencies
that
could
pay
off
with
some
excellent
beers
down
the
line
this
just
isnt
their
magnum
opus
yet
d
interesting
and
not
as
weird
as
it
sounds
like
but
still
its
a
bit
edgy
and
unbalanced
perhaps
this
is
the
result
of
poor
quality
control
next
time
im
in
santa
cruz
id
like
to
see
how
this
does
ontap
at
which
point
ill
rereview
but
this
sample
may
as
well
have
been
chugged
straight
from
the
can
lightly
sweet
citrus
at
the
very
front
then
an
intesifying
fruitiness
with
apples
and
raisins
comes
along
and
intensifies
leading
to
a
quite
spicy
belgian
yeast
redux
long
spicy
finish
ends
with
a
bit
of
earth
tropical
twist
on
the
fruitiness
of
a
dubbel
and
surprisingly
spicy
in
general
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
refer
to
as
interesting
though
probably
would
not
go
for
again
lightly
bodied
with
a
very
big
dose
of
carbon
dioxide
much
too
much
of
it
enough
to
damage
the
score
overall
very
impressed
so
drinkable
for
a
dubbel
and
8
5
alc
i
originally
tried
this
beer
a
year
or
so
when
it
first
came
out
in
the
area
wasnt
too
impressed
seemed
a
little
funky
spicy
unrefined
at
the
time
heard
it
had
changed
a
bit
since
conception
so
decided
to
give
it
another
go
and
rate
it
unbelievably
good
a
lot
going
on
santa
cruz
is
known
for
surf
hippies
and
liberals
but
the
microbrewery
dept
has
been
lacking
i
predict
these
guys
will
change
that
if
they
keep
moving
in
this
direction
i
also
hope
they
will
start
putting
out
more
cans
of
their
lineup
as
this
is
the
only
one
i
think
they
are
canning
at
this
point
a
couple
other
choices
locally
on
tap
but
thats
about
it
at
this
point
look
out
for
these
fellas
bought
a
can
of
this
in
berkeley
recently
at
ledgers
this
is
much
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
the
can
gives
the
impression
that
its
going
to
be
a
cheap
lager
bud
light
lime
clone
in
particular
with
the
prominently
displayed
lime
on
the
front
and
the
gaudy
silver
and
green
colors
of
course
its
really
a
belgian
dubbel
that
is
surprisingly
and
delightfully
spiced
with
kaffir
lime
lemongrass
and
coriander
the
spicing
is
aggressive
and
the
lime
is
noticeable
but
restrained
enough
to
work
pours
a
sort
of
murky
dark
amber
with
a
fair
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
heavier
on
the
lime
and
lighter
on
the
spices
while
the
taste
is
the
other
way
around
the
sweetness
and
richness
of
a
respectable
dubbel
blends
well
with
the
thai
flavors
not
only
would
this
go
well
with
curry
it
tastes
a
little
curried
itself
surprisingly
delightful
and
not
just
a
gimmick
change
your
packaging
to
reflect
the
seriousness
of
your
endeavor
siamese
twin
is
truly
an
uncommon
beer
and
that
is
what
makes
it
so
great
i
truly
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
as
i
am
absolutely
loving
it
beachshore
this
or
ten
fidy
each
are
going
to
do
some
damage
but
here
you
have
a
fighting
chance
plus
the
taste
is
probably
going
to
have
a
wider
appeal
than
a
ris
i
still
say
that
mamas
little
yella
pils
is
the
best
candidate
but
this
could
certainly
be
afforded
some
cooler
space
best
case
scenario
my
cousin
cans
sculpin
and
you
blend
the
two
in
a
recyclable
cup
the
tropical
flavors
might
be
enough
to
give
you
an
apoplectic
fit
can

murky
brown
with
a
thick
light
tan

aroma
of
belgian

sweet

light

apple

and
light

sweet

with

in
the
finish
sweet
but
drinkable
and
tasty
d
with
flavors
this
bold
i
couldnt
see
myself
throwing
back
more
than
a
couple
of
these
despite
the
flavor
oddity
its
certainly
tasty
enough
to
finish
a
glass
with
no
issues
drinkability
is
crazy
combining
the
amazing
taste
and
the
alcohol
level
this
one
could
make
a
fool
out
of
any
ba
i
wish
i
had
more
this
is
brewery
will
rock
the
industry
this
is
just
a
little
to
weird
to
really
be
all
that
drinkable
d
you
know
when
i
read
that
this
was
an
asian
inspired
dubbel
i
didnt
know
what
to
think
after
sampling
it
i
have
to
say
it
works
the
flavors
are
really
big
and
that
does
take
away
from
the
drinkability
to
me
because
it
really
weighs
on
the
palate
with
that
said
its
still
an
enjoyable
brew
and
there
is
very
little
wrong
with
it
imo
the
flavors
are
interesting
and
enjoyable
sure
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
and
the
flavors
can
be
a
bit
heavy
but
screw
it
damn
impressive
take
on
the
style
and
a
hell
of
impressive
brew
coming
out
of
that
can
hell
yeah
d
after
hearing
a
lot
about
these
brewers
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
on
tap
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
deep
redamber
with
a
modest
creamy
looking
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
light
acidic
notes
and
some
spice
the
flavor
is
quite
malty
like
caramel
and
cookies
moderately
sweet
with
less
spice
than
the
aroma
and
a
pronounced
lime
aspect
coming
in
towards
the
end
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
richly
flavored
dubbel
although
quite
drinkable
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
the
lime
is
definitely
a
starring
flavor
component
i
think
that
these
guys
have
succeeded
in
being
exactly
what
they
claim
to
be
uncommon
that
being
said
this
one
is
a
bit
more
on
the
interesting
side
than
the
awesome
side
but
i
would
gladly
have
another
when
this
becomes
more
available
3
5
rerate
canned
less
head
more
alcohol
less
lime
still
uncommon
this
might
not
be
what
you
think
of
when
you
think
abbey
dubbel
but
it
goes
really
well
with
foods
that
have
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
the
lime
wasnt
overpowering
like
the
draught
pint
i
had
a
few
months
back
but
it
still
gives
a
nice
complexity
along
with
the
lemongrass
and
coriander
i
really
like
this
reminiscent
of
a
saison
from
the
spicey
and
yeasty
qualites
but
with
the
malt
backing
of
a
dubbel
some
caramel
deep
in
the
middle
before
the
finish
with
earthy
spicey
components
nice
hop
bitterness
more
corriander
and
clove
lemon
lime
other
citrus
flavors
very
nice
and
appetizing
d
an
unique
tasting
brew
from
uncommon
the
2
beers
ive
had
from
them
have
really
been
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
a
weird
and
enjoyable
take
on
the
dubbel
pick
it
up
drinkability
not
too
bad
the
smell
is
really
nice
and
very
interesting
although
its
not
very
belgium
the
taste
however
isnt
as
spicy
and
much
more
belgium
like
granted
it
does
open
some
as
it
warms
overall
very
interesting
and
i
did
enjoy
it
thanks
tim
drinkability
is
ok
unique
is
an
understatement
when
describing
this
beer
its
very
odd
yet
strangely
refreshing
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
im
not
sure
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
overall
not
a
bad
beer
especially
at
10
bucks
for
4
16oz
cans
but
not
my
favorite
probably
wont
buy
another
4pk
d
8
5
is
dangerous
but
i
like
this
beer
what
we
have
here
is
a
hoppy
belgian
dubbel
with
thai
spices
especially
coriander
said
nor
cal
bobby
java
coriander
chewy
one
of
the
weirdest
dubbels
i
have
ever
tasted
bananas
certified
organic
and
a
bit
spicey
a
little
banana
wonderful
flavor
big
malt
small
off
white
head
on
a
beautiful
ruby
red
brown
body
aroma
of
toasted
grain
raisins
and
lightly
oxidized
caramel
lots
of
toasty
malt
and
raisins
in
the
flavor
with
a
lingering
oddly
licorice
note
a
fairly
thin
body
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
bottle
may
have
been
a
little
on
the
old
side
but
nonetheless
an
unusually
well
made
interpretation
of
the
style
for
an
american
brewery
to
the
beer
deep
brown
copper
with
a
tight
beige
head
that
left
some
impressive
lacing
that
lasted
the
entire
glass
a
subdued
aroma
where
spice
dominates
the
nose
some
malty
sweetness
suggestive
of
dried
fruit
and
a
hint
of
earthy
yeast
the
flavor
expands
greatly
on
the
aroma
spice
becomes
cinnamon
clove
pepper
with
a
dash
of
lemon
zest
dried
fruit
flesh
out
to
dates
figs
and
mainly
raisin
yeast
maintains
its
earthy
character
certainly
not
as
big
as
the
belgians
that
inspire
this
feel
high
level
of
carbonation
a
bit
acidic
very
good
ale
raisin
notes
present
o
i
wasnt
sure
id
like
this
but
its
quite
pleasant
o
well
im
reediting
my
review
the
longer
i
drank
this
the
more
it
opened
up
nice
mix
of
dark
fruits
spice
sweet
malt
and
bready
yeast
still
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
but
its
an
ok
maltdriven
brew
picked
this
up
at
a
local
wine
and
beer
store
here
in
socal
on
a
whim
was
not
disappointed
at
all
was
not
overpowering
but
still
had
a
great
flavor
stands
up
to
its
description
i
tasted
some
dried
fruits
along
with
a
little
bit
of
banana
bread
and
im
a
sucker
for
banana
bread
this
is
definitely
something
i
would
pick
up
again
o
lacks
the
complexity
and
well
hidden
abv
of
fine
belgian
versions
taste
is
where
this
beer
kinda
loses
me
nothing
standout
here
good
balance
but
nothing
to
bring
it
to
the
next
level
ooverall
great
dubbel
wish
i
had
more
very
dark
brown
in
color
and
only
a
bit
of
light
gets
through
brussels
lacing
a
quarter
inch
thick
head
of
khaki
covered
foam
rests
on
top
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
and
dark
belgian
candy
sugar
is
what
im
getting
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
of
dark
belgian
candy
sugardark
maltands
bit
of
tart
belgian
yeast
on
the
finish
mouth
is
a
bit
chewy
and
sticky
overall
yeah
this
is
tasty
stuff
if
not
as
complex
as
it
might
have
been
theres
plenty
of
body
which
is
good
and
a
nice
about
of
spice
some
extra
sweetness
would
help
but
overall
its
still
a
really
nice
beer
a
great
tasting
beer
but
the
flavors
and
taste
are
thin
and
washed
out
o
4
25
overall
i
aged
this
beer
for
two
years
and
i
do
not
feel
rewarded
for
my
patience
a
very
surprising
beer
i
really
expected
this
to
be
beyond
sweet
and
it
has
turned
out
to
be
a
tremendous
well
crafted

and
very
smooth

on
a
highly

offering
nicely
done
glad
i
found
the
lost
found
overall
its
so
well
balanced
that
its
something
i
definitely
will
have
again
tasty
highly
drinkable
dubbel
one
thing
that
did
really
stand
out
however
was
the
incredible
amount
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
even
after
swirling
a
bit
it
was
a
bit
like
mud
and
very
thick
still
a
great
vessel
for
getting
a
good
8
dose
in
your
system
the
color
was
a
medium
dark
brown
and
a
two
finger
of
tan
foam
with
a
load
of
lace
on
the
side
of
a
tulip
glass
the
smell
was
a
little
weak
but
there
was
a
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
fruit
aroma
the
taste
was
of
the
roasted
malts
with
a
sweet
fruity
finish
along
with
and
nicely
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
on
the
palate
overall
its
a
decent
beer
to
have
with
a
steak
or
a
hearty
dinner
a
good
but
not
great
lost
abbey
offering
i
really
liked
the
texture
but
the
taste
and
smell
let
it
down
a
lovely
dubbel
really
it
pours
a
rich
spiced
rum
color
with
a
bone
white
head
light
as
a
cloud
the
nose
is
straight
raisins
and
booze
both
of
which
i
happen
to
enjoy
there
is
a
nutty
element
to
it
as
well
really
earthy
like
a
walnut
but
mildly
sweet
like
an
almond
the
flavor
takes
on
more
of
a
middle
eastern
flare
than
a
belgian
one
with
flavors
of
dates
and
figs
sweet
and
naturally
complex
and
the
raisins
are
there
too
i
love
the
fact
that
this
isnt
as
sweet
and
thick
as
some
dubbels
though
its
quite
drinkable
for
what
it
is
the
body
might
be
a
little
thin
but
i
appreciate
the
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
genre
and
the
finish
is
fruity
and
quick
but
not
sugary
or
caramel
heavy
the
spice
component
is
subtle
which
i
also
like
good
carbonation
as
well
overall
an
outstanding
beer
from
the
lost
abbey
one
im
glad
i
got
to
try
on
tap
a
very
unique
take
on
a
dubbel
a
welcome
change
overall
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
good
mix
of
flavours
while
not
cloying
or
over
boozed
id
be
happy
to
make
this
a
go
to
beer
if
readily
available
to
me
overall
a
flavorful
double
with
a
bit
more
complexity
than
average
there
is
a
bit
of
alcoholic
warmth
the
raisins
add
a
nice
dimension
to
this
note

an
underwhelming

dont
know
if
i
could
kill
a
pint
the
body
was
pretty
good
full
and
smooth
like
what
you
look
for
in
the
style
but
that
bit
of
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
was
distracting
drinkability
was
decent
the
alcohol
taste
reduced
how
much
i
would
drink
of
this
overall
a
decent
take
on
the
style
not
great
but
not
terrible
either
at
10
for
a
750
you
can
find
other
examples
as
good
and
better
for
less
cash
still
worth
trying
though
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
deep

and
syrupy
lots

overall
this
is
a
good

with
some
solid

that
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
o
not
bad
but
the
lost
abbey
hype
machine
is
at
work
here
i
just
didnt
find
this
up
with
the
solid
belgian
dubbels
out
there
its
worth
trying
but
nothing
special
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
its
a
little
less
intense
than
other
dubbels
ive
had
and
i
was
a
little
disappointed
to
not
get
a

more
dark

with
the
addition
of
the

its
still
quite

beer

com
overall
a
beer
i
rarely
drink
but
a
good
dubbel
a
decent
beer
at
a
great
price
nicely
carbonated
the
flavour
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
but
i
dont
mind
this
overall
quite
good
the
aftertaste
does
not
work
for
me
but
otherwise
quite
enjoyable
o
overall
a
nice
drinking
smooth
and
easy
going
down
dubbel
overall
a
god
easy
to
drink
winey
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
o
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
very
good
light
fruit
taste
well
done
b
d
a
pretty
good
dubbel
though
ive
definitely
had
better
good
quality
high
price
fairly
easy
drinker
id
probably
have
it
again
o
not
terribly
impressive
and
one
of
the
most
disappointing
lost
abbey
beers
ive
ever
had
i
wouldnt
speak
out
against
it
but
i
probably
wont
have
another
one
if
you
want
a
dubbel
stick
to
the
belgian
versions
havnt
had
a
beer
from
here
i
didnt
like
o
a
super
interesting
beer
with
lots
of
depth
the
fig
type
flavors
are
something
i
enjoy
this
is
my
first
lost
abbey
beer
and
i
can
say
im
a
fan
and
that
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
overallenjoyed
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
o
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
there
might
be
just
a
little
too
much
woodiness
and
not
quite
enough
sweetnesssugars
in
the
beer
not
an
unenjoyable
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
running
out
to
get
again
o
this
beer
is
a
little
too
woody
for
my
taste
and
could
use
more
sugar
and
sweetness
undated
bottle
to
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
color
with
a
decent
34
finger
head
some
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
that
of
malty
sweetness
raisin
hint
of
the
belgian
yeast
and
earthy
hops
the
nose
is
sweet
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
an
initial
malty
sweetness
the
light
belgian
character
comes
through
as
it
warms
the
raisin
fruitiness
begins
to
dominate
the
palette
in
the
middle
along
with
a
mild
bitterness
finishes
clean
and
smooth
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
good
but
isnt
my
favorite
i
had
shied
away
from
it
so
long
due
to
the
raisins
a
flavor
i
dont
care
for
as
such
i
found
the
flavor
too
powerful
with
the
fruit
though
this
could
be
due
to
my
preference
it
was
good
and
i
would
recommend
it
just
not
my
favorite
offering
from
the
lost
abbey
overall
a
nice
belgian
style
ale
that
has
a
nice
balanced
flavor
somewhat
refreshing
from
the
crispness
slow
sipping
o
nice
belgian
if
you
are
looking
for
something
a
bit
different
or
if
you
are
a
fan
of
red
ales
not
as
sourfruity
as
it
looks
overall
good
but
for
the
price
id
take
most
belgian
dubbels
over
it
overall
great
beer
tastes
similar
to
chimay
rouge
would
definitely
drink
again
semi
dry
feel
medium
tingle
and
a
faint
tannin
like
that
of
a
red
wine
but
much
more
subdued
o
an
interesting
beer
with
good
complexity
and
an
earthy
balance
solid
beer
at
first
a
malty
rich
brown
brew
with
a
tan
head
its
not
a
typical
belgian
style
sweeter
not
as
aromatic
as
most
there
are
some
pepper
phenol
and
yeast
notes
but
they
sit
behind
the
malt
the
flavor
has
a
malt
forward
character
as
well
some
fruit
and
pepper
the
phenolic
attributes
come
out
more
in
the
midtaste
nice
the
finish
is
abrupt
fuller
and
a
little
sweeter
than
i
expected
full
in
body
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
overall
happy
with
the
purchase
ive
been
trying
to
branch
out
of
my
funky
saisonsour
lambic
fixation
and
revisit
styles
i
drank
more
often
in
the
past
decided
to
try
the
lost
abbey
lineup
totally
due
to
the
flack
they
get
on
this
website
overall
very
good
beer
and
am
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
lost
abbey
lineup
d
good
dubbel
representation
here
flavors
work
well
and
the
bottle
conditioning
is
really
solid
definitely
an
enjoyabledrinkable
brew
delicious
and
beautifully
complex
brew
i
just
wish
the
cork
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
off
o
this
is
a
good
brew
but
overall
im
not
too
impressed
theres
a
great
delicate
balance
to
this
though
with
a
nice
complexity
o
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
dubbel
style
but
this
left
me
a
little
hunderwhelmed
none
of
those
bright
phenolics
still
a
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
quite
fit
the
style
for
me
mouthfeel
good
but
not
sticky
beer
needs
more
sugar
overall
a
good
beer
but
lacking
and
it
hurts
me
to
say
this
because
these
beers
have
been
in
our
dreams
for
a
long
time
here
on
the
east
coast
o
a
very
subtle
dubbel
with
some
nice
dark
fruits
and
hints
of
molasses
nice
bouquet
of
spices
in
the
finish
i
expect
more
flavor
from
a
dubbel
but
still
a
very
good
beer
o
nice
dubbel
but
not
outstanding
im
not
a
fan
of
dubbels
let
me
be
clear
thats
probably
why
im
not
giving
this
a
stellar
review
i
can
tell
that
they
spent
a
lot
of
time
developing
this
beer
as
the
malt
is
very
toffee
centric
but
its
not
too
sweet
and
it
definitely
doesnt
let
the
belgian
yeast
turn
that
toffee
into
a
tart
unpleasant
taste
that
lingers
in
the
back
of
your
throat
like
most
other
dubbels
for
this
i
commend
them
however
i
would
like
to
see
some
belgian
yeast
as
that
is
one
of
my
favorite
flavors
to
enjoy
seeing
as
how
i
didnt
get
that
aforementioned
unpleasantness
in
my
throat
i
have
to
overlook
that
a
good
dubbel
but
could
be
a
little
more
complex
i
would
reach
for
an
abbey
ale
by
new
belgium
first
but
this
is
second
for
american
made
dubbels
750
ml
bottle
bottled
on
date
of
112310
served
in
a
dfh
signature
glass
the
beer
pours
a
murky
ruby
redbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
the
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
the
brew
smells
like
dark
fruit
mostly
raisins
along
with
some
cherries
and
figs
nuts
brown
sugar
and
toffee
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
a
bit
of
spice
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
has
moderate
carbonation
its
also
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
this
is
a
solid
overall
brew
and
at
8
99
a
bottle
id
buy
it
again
the
next
time
i
see
it
certainly
worth
a
try
medium
toast
nutty
and
dry
malt
flavor
rise
to
the
forefront
while
zesty
tartness
of
red
wine
slightly
vinous
orange
zest
underrippened
berries
apples
and
grape
contribute
much
needed
complexity
but
to
support
the
malt
sweetness
and
not
to
compete
with
them
early
sweetness
evaporates
into
dryness
then
leaving
the
impression
of
malt
and
fruit
flavor
but
without
the
associated
sweetness
a
whimsical
delight
that
finishes
with
the
mild
peppery
bite
of
alcohol
and
black
peppercorn
it
certainly
rivals
authentic
belgainbrewed
varieties
such
as
grimbergen
dubbel
wouldnt
recommend
other
than
if
youre
all
about
this
style
or
you
just
want
something
different
to
try
like
so
much
of
las
stuff
more

a
hazy
dark
copper
with
a
small
very
light
tan
head
that
has
very
good
retention
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
caramel
candi

a
bit
of
banana
and
some
bready

the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
some
candi
sugar
then
some
raisin
caramel
and
a
bready
yeast
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
fairly
enjoyable
beer
o
good
stuff
i
think
it
needed
a
more
bold
flavor
but
good
nonetheless
d
not
bad
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
would
have
liked
to
see
more
dominant
dark
fruits

a
rich
clear

color
off

and
little

taste
raisin

alittle
peppery

a
hint
of
brown
sugar
along
with
caramel
and
bready

medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
even
finish
overall
a
very
tasty
dubbel
with
good
juicy
malt
flavor
and
moreish
finish
o
im
not
sure
how
much
this
costs
in
the
store
but
i
dont
think
i
would
pay
too
much
for
it
as
it
was
i
thought
this
was
pretty
solid
pours
a
dark
purplishbrown
color
with
a
large
lighttan

that
diminishes
slowly
scent
has
a
ton
of
raisin
and
prune

a
hint
of
booze
and
sweet

as
well
taste
is
just
as
it
smells
predominate
raisin

dark

flavors
a
lot
of
caramel

flavors
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
wellcarbonated
drinkability
is
fairly
high
out
of
dubbels
tripels
and
quads
dubbels
are
my
least
favorite
this
one
happens
to
be
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
i
am
a
big
fan
of
dubbels
and
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
a
domestic
one
i
have
passed
this
on
the
shelf
numerous
times
and
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
finally
try
it
overall
its
a
solid
beer
its
not
my
favorite
from
the
lost
abbey
nor
is
it
my
favorite
dubbel
but
solid
nonetheless
over
all
not
my
favorite
lost
abbey
but
worth
the
price
tag
overall
its
a
tasty
dubbel
that
thankfully
doesnt
hit
hard
with
any
cloying
sweetness
or
enameldissolving
ethanol
bursts
sadly
i
havent
had
it
since
that
very
first
saints
club
shipment
all
those
many
long
years
ago
overall
this
isnt
as
complex
as
some
other
dubbels
ive
had
recently
the
aroma
in
particular
is
a
little
disappointing
just
not
much
there
medium
mouthfeel
but
not
too
sweet
not
a
dry
finish
as
in
some
belgians
an
excellent
brew
overall
o
great
sipping
beer
not
to
much
not
to
little
nice
attempt
at
the
style
d
this
style
of
beer
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
am
warming
to
the
idea
more
and
more
lost
and
found
is
a
big
reason
why
i
like
how
the
sweetnessfruitiness
are
balanced
by
the
spice
the
complexity
of
flavors
masks
the
alcohol
enough
to
make
this
a
rather
drinkable
beer
drink
its
easy
to
drink
but
was
looking
for
bigger
flavors
i
think
i
mostly
find
this
to
be
a
big
beer
and
not
overly
sweet
but
could
be
just
a
bit
more
dubbel
forward
without
the
raisin
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
hazy
dark
orange
brown
color
the
head
is
pretty
big
at
first
but
then
it
settles
down
into
just
a
thin
tan
line
over
the
beer
the
smell
was
a
little
earthy
with
some
dark
fruits
and
spices
mixed
in
there
the
taste
wasnt
too
bad
at
first
while
it
was
still
cold
i
found
this
beer
to
become
a
little
gross
as
it
warmed
up
not
sure
why
usually
thats
not
a
problem
with
beers
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
here
overall
the
smell
and
look
of
the
beer
are
the
only
good
thing
about
it
this
brew
pours
a
darkmurky
orange
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
one
finger
head
that
stays
and
leaves
a
nice
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
raisinsfigsspices
and
herbal
hopsit
has
a
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
has
tastes
of
raisinsfigscandyliquorice
and
finished
with
a
spicy
herbal
hoppyiness
but
not
overly
bitter
just
bitter
enough
to
counteract
the
sweetness
first
encountered
and
overall
a
nice
enterpretation
of
a
belgian
ale
o
i
like
lost
abbey
this
one
has
been
sittin
for
a
little
while
as
i
had
forgotten
about
it
either
way
it
was
as
tasty
as
the
others
ive
had
from
them
o
i
like
this
beer
very
nice
aroma
and
flavor
the
finish
could
be
a
little
bit
less
bitter
but
it
is
still
an
excellent
beer
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
quite
drinkable
sweet
mildy
fruity
no
bitterness
come
across
a
little
like
a
barleywine
and
less
like
a
dubbel
or
whatever
this
is
suppose
to
be
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
lost
abbey
sorry
the
lost
abbey
beers
ive
had
that
wasnt
barrel
whatevered
id
have
it
again
i
believe
this
was
an
extra
in
a
trade
mf
the
beer
is
flavorful
thick
and
borderline
syrupy
though
it
pulls
it
back
just
enough
pours
a
deep
murky
brown
color
with
red
hues
throughout
with
a
thick
brown
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
awhile
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
raisins
and
dark
fruit
and
a
good
malt
character
overpowering
malts
throughout
the
taste
with
raisin
grape
brown
sugar
and
nutmeg
not
a
fan
of
the
nutmeg
at
all
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
oily
and
it
has
a
nice
light
carbonation
overall
i
think
the
flavor
is
very
complex
with
a
few
notes
i
dont
care
for
i
think
it
is
a
great
representation
of
its
style
and
the
raisin
really
shines
through
a
good
beer
d
drinkability
is
moderate
its
an
easydrinking
beer
but
the
flavors
are
unfortunately
kind
of
bland
an
okay
representation
of
the
style
but
too
malty
for
my
taste
o
this
was
a
miss
for
me
kind
of
a
letdown
the
flavor
profile
is
just
meh
imo
didnt
go
down
all
that
easily
and
the
lingering
flavor
wasnt
very
appealing
update
they
say
you
should
finish
a
growler
1
2
days
after
opening
it
this
is
one
of
the
growlers
you
should
finish
the
day
you
open
it
i
finished
mine
off
on
the
2nd
day
and
could
taste
oxidation
setting
in
4
0
d
well
what
can
i
say
for
as
much
as
i
hate
tomme
arthur
he
can
make
a
pretty
good
brew
when
he
can
get
it
carbonated
this
is
right
up
there
with
most
of
its
native
counterparts
if
i
could
trust
that
every
bottle
would
be
this
good
read
carbonated
i
might
even
be
willing
to
pay
the
premium
that
lost
abbey
commands
great
taste
and
good
overall
except
for
the
lack
of
body
pours
a
semitranslucenthazy
amber
to
dark
brown
very
thick
beige
head
lingers
for
awhile
very
rich
and
complex
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
of
figs
and
raisins
with
a
contrast
of
citrusy
lemon
or
lime
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
the
carbonation
did
seem
a
tinge
too
high
wow
a
four
finger
head
of
medium
dense
foam
of
light
brown
this
head
has
some
staying
power
and
leaves
a
thick
clinging
lace
color
is
a
29
on
the
srm
beer
chart
smell
are
many
and
seem
to
be
ever
changing
with
each
draw
there
are
aromas
of
raisins
figs
chocolate
banana
caramel
toffee
apple
pear
and
citrus
taste
is
as
complex
as
the
smell
and
i
am
glad
this
is
a
big
bottle
for
with
each
sample
i
detect
something
new
there
are
flavors
of
raisins
banana
fig
nutmeg
apple
chocolate
coffee
pear
malt
black
pepper
lime
peel
caramel
toffee
and
licorice
there
are
others
but
i
am
starting
to
get
a
buzz
and
it
hinders
my
taste
buds
talk
about
creaminess
in
my
mouth
maybe
just
a
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
and
some
drying
and
sticky
feel
on
my
upper
palate
but
overall
very
good
this
will
be
a
great
desert
beer
and
not
bad
with
sharp
cheese
to
set
off
the
sweetness
i
will
have
another
please
theres
still
a
few
lost
abbeys
for
me
to
try
but
this
is
my
favorite
to
date
strong
aroma
is
malty
and
a
little
fruity
with
a
yeasty
underpinning
and
hints
of
caramel
it
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
a
thick
pale
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
flavor
is
malty
slightly
sweet
slightly
sour
with
hints
of
caramel
and
fruit
the
latter
mainly
grapes
and
apple
it
goes
down
the
hatch
smoothly
yet
leaves
a
firm
persistent
tingle
behind
im
glad
that
this
lost
abbey
has
been
found
the
taste
is
sweet
which
matches
the
fruity
aroma
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
and
has
layers
of
flavors
the
thing
about
this
beer
that
sets
it
back
is
the
last
flavor
that
sits
on
your
tounge
is
an
odd
one
its
like
an
off
alcohol
flavor
that
just
wont
go
away
d
this
is
a
lighter
and
fruitier
version
of
the
style
well
done
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
but
nothing
was
present
to
really
knock
it
out
of
the
park
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
the
style
adequately
carbonated
and
finished
silky
and
creamy
this
beer
overall
is
pretty
good
it
is
my
first
lost
abby
beer
nothing
outstanding
or
epic
but
good
looking
forward
to
sampling
more
in
the
very
near
future
d
excellent
right
on
for
the
style
very
well
executed
tasty
stuff
taste
is
where
this
beer
comes
out
delcious
to
say
the
least
very
fruity
tasting
dates
pear
and
raisin
go
on
a
tear
as
light
notes
of
chocolate
malt
give
me
the
feeling
that
this
is
like
dessert
in
a
glass
the
alcohol
goes
nearly
unnoticed
making
an
already
appetizing
beer
even
more
addicting
d
an
ok
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
la
the
raisins
are
very
strong
and
the
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
taste
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
again
not
my
favorite
la
offering
but
la
is
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
a
decent
dubbel
though
a
bit
too
raisiny
for
me
surely
better
than
on
tap
and
would
surely
benefit
from
a
more
lasting
carbonation
but
then
thats
old
news
best
served
and
enjoyed
rather
warm
about
60
degrees
or
so
i
would
guess
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
i
really
think
that
tomme
and
co
should
just
stick
to
belgianstyle
beers
and
sours
because
he
hasnt
pulled
off
a
germanstyle
beer
that
ive
actually
liked
nor
do
i
think
hes
all
that
interested
in
the
outcome
anyway
pours
rubyish
calico
brown
without
too
much
foam
i
get
figs
licorice
faint
wood
and
cinnamon
on
both
the
smell
and
tastes
alright
more
of
a
spiced
brown
if
you
ask
me
d
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
would
like
to
space
them
out
between
servings
d
very
good
tasting
beer
that
is
sucking
me
into
the
world
of
belgian
beers
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
copper
with
a
solid
foamy
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
sweet
and
caramelly
a
little
tang
to
the
palate
mild
fruits
bread
caramel
malts
and
just
a
smudge
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
medium
body
with
nice
carbonation
somewhat
dry
and
sticky
very
drinkable
dubbel
i
may
have
given
this
higher
marks
if
it
had
delivered
on
the
promise
the
smell
makes
or
it
could
have
been
just
like
it
smells
and
i
could
have
panned
it
for
not
tasting
like
beer
im
never
happy
jd
chestnut
brown
pour
with
little
head
spritzy
bubbles
almost
cokelike
at
first
this
seemed
like
some
kind
of
bock
it
was
really
malty
and
smoky
lacked
the
spiciness
i
expected
grew
on
me
as
the
glass
wore
thin
solid
just
heavy
on
the
malt
and
had
a
kind
of
smoked
toasted
character
fruits
like
figs
dates
and
bananas
shined
throughout
had
the
feel
been
thicker
it
would
have
been
very
nice
m
d
nice
in
fluffy
well
carbonated
and
very
complex
beer
very
drinkable
and
delicious
overall
its
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
still
a
solid
brew
cheers
d
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
drinkable
not
overpowering
in
sweetness
but
it
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
the
best
lost
abbey
beer
ive
tried
to
date
pours
dark
redalmost
brown
in
color
with
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
aroma
of
dark
fruit
syrup
spices
cloves
and
burnt
sugar
flavors
of
spices
dark
fruit
slight
hops
sugars
molasses
apples
dipped
in
alcohol
raisins
and
prunes
light
in
body
with
mild
carbonation
a
pleasant
slow
sipper
to
be
savored
this
is
a
complex
and
tasty
brew
the
sweetness
from
the
raisins
and
darker
malts
was
not
overpowering
but
contributed
a
lot
to
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
a
great
sipper
by
the
fire
i
would
say
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
enjoyed
with
a
mild
dessert
as
the
sweetness
will
combine
very
well
enjoy
poured
a
dark
brown
with
orange
highlights
with
a
thin
head
that
left
very
little
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
consisted
of
slight
belgian
yeast
notes
figs
raisins
slight
spice
and
brown
sugar
with
some
underlying
booze
notes
there
also
seems
to
be
faint
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
upfront
the
dark
fruits
and
candy
sugar
strike
first
on
the
palate
with
chocolate
slight
coffee
and
malty
accents
which
also
had
a
little
booze
on
the
back
end
the
brew
was
medium
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
sweet
silky
and
slight
boozy
finish
it
drank
quite
well
but
wasnt
as
potent
on
the
flavor
as
i
thought
it
would
be
for
a
dubbel
it
also
seemed
to
be
a
little
thin
for
the
style
as
well
i
honestly
think
the
bottle
version
is
better
imo
an
interesting
twist
inspired
by
a
traditional
style
results
in
a
kickass
beer
we
dig
it
extremely
complex
and
immensely
enjoyable
this
beer
would
be
an
excellent
candidate
for
a
cigar
pairing
lost
and
found
is
a
nice
rendition
of
the
style
but
maybe
a
little
light
overall
pretty
easy
sipper
for
the
style
as
it
doesnt
get
so
dark
fruit
sweet
and
sticky
d
this
is
a
quite
tame
dubbel
an
easy
one
to
get
started
on
abbey
ales
with
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
and
carbonation
is
moderate
to
low
drinkability
isnt
as
high
as
a
lot
of
lost
abbeys
beers
for
me
the
alcohol
shows
a
bit
too
much
in
the
finish
and
the
raisin
flavor
wasnt
one
of
my
favorites
interesting
beer
though
d
likely
a
oneanddone
beer
first
half
is
pretty
nice
but
gets
too
heavy
throughout
sweetness
a
little
too
overhwhelming
d
a
very
easydrinking
750ml
could
drink
plenty
of
this
and
enjoy
it
goes
down
well
though
glad
i
tried
it
this
beer
need
some
tweaks
to
find
it
identity
perhaps
a
yeast
change
and
some
more
carbonation
with
a
push
towards
a
quadrupel
drinkability
complex
for
the
style
and
it
took
me
a
bit
of
time
to
warm
up
to
this
beer
it
is
different
from
other
dubbels
i
have
had
i
like
the
raisin
and
bread
combination
not
sure
if
i
would
rush
to
get
this
as
much
as
other
lost
abbey
beers
but
would
not
pass
it
over
pours
a
nice
coppery
almost
pennycolor
with
a
big
head
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
aromas
of
belgian
spices
raisins
figs
and
brown
sugar
nicely
carbonated
which
contributes
nicely
to
its
drinkability
fairly
sweet
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
initially
and
spices
and
a
hit
of
drying
alcohol
heat
on
the
back
end
d
not
good
luckily
i
had
a
friend
that
will
drink
anything
otherwise
this
would
have
been
a
drain
pour
cant
imagine
this
is
how
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
that
being
nearly
flat
if
so
i
now
know
why
this
abbey
was
lost
very
disappointed
after
looking
forward
to
this
brew
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
astringent
carbonated
and
edgy
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
beer
overall
is
pretty
good
it
is
my
first
lost
abby
beer
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
was
hoping
that
is
was
going
to
be
better
overall
i
give
this
an
a
i
really
enjoyed
the
overall
complexity
and
the
sweetness
was
not
overpowering
great
job
lost
abbey
overall
was
another
solid
offering
from
lost
abbey
but
it
failed
to
really
stand
out
to
me
in
the
style
worth
a
look
taste
was
very
malty
enjoyed
it
banana
clove
yeasty
and
bready
mouthfeel
was
quite
smooth
a
tad
of
bitterness
to
boot
d
fairly
drinkable
flavorful
and
complex
not
as
harsh
as
some
of
these
beers
f
a
little
alcohol
warmth
comes
through
still
pretty
sweet
though
some
bitterness
with
a
lingering
sweet
syrupy
taste
and
some
alcohol
tingle
as
well
as
some
candi
sugar
taste
the
roasted
flavors
also
linger
honestly
while
this
is
a
great
drinker
at
the
end
of
the
day
since
you
can
get
raisin
flavors
in
dubbels
without
using
raisins
why
brew
one
with
raisins
that
said
this
is
better
than
a
number
of
belgiumbrewed
dubbels
i
have
had
good
stuff
not
a
terrific
beer
but
i
liked
it
lost
and
found
is
one
of
the
better
american
dubbels
out
there
well
i
sure
cant
go
with
the
flow
on
this
after
the
bottles
cracked
the
beers
happy
to
see
me
it
overflow
its
ok
poured
with
a
big
off
white
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
nice
rich
mahoganey
aroma
is
a
little
raisiny
but
not
as
rich
as
id
anticipated
flav
is
decent
but
not
as
big
as
id
figured
good
body
and
carbonation
a
little
boozy
at
the
end
not
one
of
my
favs
bot
not
bad
had
this
on
tap
at
pb
taproom
while
visiting
in
san
diego
tapped
into
a
goblet
beautiful
dark
ruby
beer
with
thick
white
head
the
nose
is
raisins
caramel
fig
really
nice
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
touch
of
sourness
to
balance
the
slightly
sweet
flavor
of
roasted
malts
chocolatecaramel
figraisin
kept
sticking
my
nose
in
the
glass
to
smell
it
marveling
after
each
sip
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
crystal
clear
december
afternoon
excellent
cali
abbey
ale
a
good
beer
that
could
use
some
champagne
like
liveliness
d
a
unique
take
on
the
style
and
a
good
one
from
an
american
brewery
i
would
say
it
drinks
about
right
for
the
abv
and
style
not
super
memorable
but
a
decent
first
beer
from
lost
abbey
for
myself
d
this
is
absolutely
spot
on
for
the
style
probably
the
best
american
version
of
an
abbey
dubbel
ive
ever
had
spice
and
carbonation
make
this
beer
seem
like
a
time
tested
belgian
classic
draught
at
the
brewery
brown
with
a
tan
head
fruity
almost
tart
berry
aroma
with
some
light
caramel
as
well
dry
and
vinous
flavor
witha
light
fruity
tartness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
this
was
a
big
surprise
a
lean
dry
tart
dubbel
i
could
have
drank
a
lot
more
of
this
d
not
overpowering
could
have
a
few
if
i
didnt
get
very
bored
the
cork
flies
off
and
almost
busts
a
light
bulb
like
some
shit
out
of
das
boot
the
head
is
enormous
that
is
basically
all
there
is
to
this
beer
a
creamy
cream
coloured
head
the
body
is
a
deep
slightly
turbid
brown
im
going
to
bump
up
the
appearance
grade
a
small
bit
because
the
head
is
so
amazing
in
texture
and
colour
the
nose
is
boozy
slightly
dry
and
not
very
spicy
or
fruity
sweet
the
taste
is
a
sharp
bitterness
of
hops
and
booze
being
balanced
out
by
sweet
malts
body
is
too
carbonated
just
moved
to
the
area
and
i
made
my
first
trip
to
holiday
wine
cellar
in
escondido
ca
and
it
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
beer
store
i
have
ever
been
to
it
was
heaven
i
am
a
fan
life
is
good
d
wouldnt
want
to
finish
a
bottle
of
this
alone
1012oz
would
be
plenty
for
me
i
would
definately
drink
this
again
and
i
bet
when
fresh
from
the
brewerey
this
beer
would
really
shine
a
hazy
brown
colored
ale
with
a
very
nice
puffy
light
brown
to
yellowish
tan
colored
head
one
of
the
nicest
looking
dubbels
i
have
seen
in
a
while
smell
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
lot
of
coriander
in
there
lots
of
phenols
in
this
one
there
is
a
distinct
banana
and
an
apple
aroma
this
hits
the
nose
quite
hard
after
a
while
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
are
discernible
the
taste
begins
woody
and
spicy
a
lot
like
chewing
on
cinnamon
bark
sticks
quickly
the
fruitier
aspects
of
this
beer
make
themselves
known
cinnamon
bark
apple
banana
and
brown
sugar
about
sum
up
the
taste
the
coriander
is
there
but
not
so
strongly
as
in
the
scent
wow
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
poured
out
of
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
small
sniffer
was
very
impressed
imediately
smelled
of
raisons
from
the
getgo
very
strong
and
pleasant
smell
the
color
is
definately
cloudy
and
carmel
dark
brown
rainsons
and
dates
come
to
the
tastebuds
imediately
a
belgian
style
dubbel
i
will
definately
have
again
soon
drinkability
a
solid
interpretation
of
a
classic
belgian
trappist
ale
but
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
the
port
however
i
still
think
the
belgians
have
the
edge
in
this
style
if
you
can
find
it
not
easy
outside
the
us
then
you
should
damn
well
try
it
overall
a
good
if
pretty
standard
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
definitely
worth
a
try
though
poured
a
medium
brown
with
tan
head
into
a
chalice
aroma
is
dark
fruit
with
maybe
a
touch
of
alcohol
flavor
is
similar
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
a
little
malt
and
sweetness
plus
a
little
alcohol
warming
as
it
warmed
i
got
a
little
chocolate
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
that
lived
up
to
the
hype
d
this
is
a
very
nice
dubbel
very
unique
flavor
combinations
this
one
tastes
very
dense
relatively
sweet
those
characteristic
belgian
sugars
very
high
alcohol
in
this
one
i
can
detect
the
raisins
and
a
mix
of
other
fruit
flavors
pretty
good
beer
but
strong
so
bee
careful
the
taste
is
very
light
of
flavor
but
its
a
very
fullbodied
taste
and
mouthfeel
very
well
executed
and
easily
the
peer
of
the
majority
of
authentic
versionsbrewers
of
the
style
tap
the
local
poured
deep
mahogany
with
ruby
edges
very
brown
small
offwhite
head
and
no
lacing
nutty
caramel
malt
aroma
that
is
sweet
raisins
and
dates
are
also
present
but
in
a
nonsweetened
state
flat
mouthfeel
with
very
little
carbonation
kind
of
heavy
but
not
syrupy
dense
dark
fruit
tastes
with
caramel
however
there
is
a
nice
separation
of
the
two
and
it
avoids
a
candy
flavor
some
occasional
roasted
malt
and
brown
sugar
taste
pop
in
and
out
fig
date
and
plum
flavors
waft
in
and
out
as
it
warms
its
kind
of
strange
drinks
predominantly
like
a
dubbel
but
has
the
hint
of
a
doppelbock
overall
this
brew
was
way
too
carbonated
i
lost
the
majority
of
this
brew
blowing
off
the
excessive
head
into
the
sink
after
that
each
swig
foamed
like
mad
and
made
it
very
hard
to
drink
the
flavor
wasnt
bad
but
this
onewas
kind
of
a
miss
the
only
complaint
that
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
i
think
it
was
under
carbonated
for
the
style
it
almost
felt
flat
to
me
d
delicious
beer
highly
drinkable
drinkability
good
taste
is
tangy
a
little
thin
nutty
malt
raisins
prunes
spice
and
some
cocoa
this
isnt
the
best
dubbel
i
have
tried
but
still
a
solid
beer
750ml
bottle
into
2
dfh
signature
glasses
shared
with
rtratzlaff
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
is
loads
of
dried
fruits
and
burnt
malts
with
slight
spice
the
taste
is
a
decent
amount
of
dried
fruits
and
dark
malts
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
slight
dryness
this
one
is
descent
but
not
as
good
as
the
other
lost
abbey
beers
ive
tried
so
far
this
would
be
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
but
its
close
to
being
even
more
drinkable
than
that
great
taste
and
wellhidden
alcohol
make
this
one
a
keeper
mf
full
big
body
ample
carbonation
very
heavy
overall
good
thing
if
you
love
to
drink
boxes
of
raisons
this
is
for
you
i
like
the
unique
aspect
of
the
beer
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
thin
feel
will
stop
me
from
purchasing
this
again
overall
this
is
not
the
style
for
me
i
can
see
how
people
could
love
a
beer
like
this
but
i
just
do
not
have
the
pallet
for
it
im
usually
a
sharing
person
when
it
comes
to
beer
but
this
beer
created
in
me
an
intense
animal
protectiveness
i
think
i
snarled
at
my
roommate
when
he
went
in
for
a
sip
color
is
a
deep
amber
with
a
big
creamy
and
frothy
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
aroma
was
that
of
belgian
yeast
with
some
light
raisin
notes
flavor
was
that
of
candi
sugar
slight
chocolate
malt
and
sweet
malt
and
caramel
with
a
light
spice
also
apparent
full
bodied
and
good
carbonation
not
as
good
as
some
other
lost
abbey
beers
but
still
pretty
well
done
overall
another
great
release
from
this
san
diego
microbrewery
d
overcarbonation
is
a
hallmark
of
belgian
beers
and
to
my
surprise
lost
abbey
lands
on
the
right
side
of
the
carbonation
spectrum
for
once
this
is
a
very
good
belgianstyle
ale
and
i
can
see
myself
picking
it
up
again
provided
theyve
got
their
consistency
down
and
their
prices
in
line
with
similar
offerings
from
other
breweries
theres
nothing
here
that
makes
it
stand
out
against
say
unibroue
or
even
the
trappist
ales
a
very
well
made
belgian
style
beer
flavor
is
robust
and
intensely
fruity
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
coming
back
definitely
a
worthwhile
find
drinkable
and
delicious
lost
abbey
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
unique
take
on
these
great
belgian
styles
nose
is
of
caramel
and
fruit
from
the
raisins
and
hints
of
biscuits
color
was
clean
and
vibrant
with
little
head
retention
and
lacing
taste
was
mouthfilling
and
delicious
could
have
a
few
glasses
of
this
one
for
sure
but
better
to
share
with
a
friend
1
more
down
on
my
quest
to
drink
the
whole
lost
abbey
line
westsiiiide
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
light
and
fluffy
really
delicious
yeast
is
at
just
the
right
level
to
mesh
with
the
other
flavors
instead
of
dominating
them
perfectly
executed
drinkability
good
though
i
cant
see
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
not
drinkable
in
the
sessionable
sense
but
its
a
beer
that
would
make
an
excellent
nightcap
it
makes
me
wish
i
was
using
it
as
one
for
some
reason
this
beer
makes
me
think
it
would
pair
up
really
well
with
some
plum
pudding
with
lots
of
hard
sauce
still
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
take
the
edge
off
an
annoying
day
at
work
on
a
rainy
sunday
mmmmm
tastes
like
sweet
candied
plums
or
sugar
coated
raisins
whatever
its
sweet
fruity
and
delicious
super
smooth
mild
alcoholic
swallow
intensely
flavorful
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
smooth
drinkability
solid
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
detracts
somewhat
if
this
was
carbonated
even
half
as
much
as
a
normal
belgian
it
would
be
close
to
fantastic
i
wish
to
keep
this
beer
on
hand
it
was
a
crowd
pleaser
for
sure
this
bottle
was
at
least
a
year
old
am
im
not
sure
if
more
time
would
have
mellowed
and
helped
the
cause
very
nice
but
seemed
to
suffer
a
bit
in
the
drinkability
category
solid
brew
a
and
i
were
fairly
far
apart
in
our
assessment
of
this
a
solid
brew
my
first
shot
at
lost
abbey
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
not
a
knock
your
socks
off
experience
but
a
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
its
a
little
too
fizzy
for
me
quite
drinkable
solid
beer
a
fine
american
made
belgian
style
dubbel
plenty
of
other
examples
i
enjoy
more
just
didnt
seem
to
come
together
for
me
lost
found
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
even
if
you
are
in
pa
and
must
get
a
case
do
so
as
you
will
not
regret
it
as
i
finish
the
bottle
im
content
to
sit
in
tranquility
and
reflect
on
the
words
printed
on
its
label
a
life
worth
living
is
full
of
discovery
and
we
are
reminded
everywhere
there
is
opportunity
i
do
raise
this
glass
in
a
toast
to
patience
perseverance
and
all
the
things
we
have
lost
along
the
way
and
were
somehow
lucky
enough
to
find
once
again
i
enjoyed
this
in
its
very
own
glass
for
sinners
and
saints
alike
unwavering
threequarter
finger
mocha
head
small
bubble
carbonation
liberal
in
circumference
with
staying
power
looks
good
so
far
i
can
see
yeast
spots
in
the
glass
bottom
and
the
colour
is
somewhat
lighter
than
a
prune
nectar
raisins
in
the
nose
also
coriander
and
yeast
very
smooth
mouthfeel
strikes
an
appreciative
chord
velvet
texture
alcohol
hardly
noticeable
in
my
cellar
tempurature
brew
taste
is
spiced
apple
and
raisins
but
mostly
mincemeat
tart
perhaps
a
dash
of
pepper
but
softer
maybe
a
lemon
pepper
flash
here
and
there
delightful
and
very
much
reminiscent
of
its
belgian
cousins
what
a
treat
thanks
to
my
beer
buddy
for
a
taste
of
this
one
that
he
acquired
in
a
trade
amen
i
was
on
the
fence
about
dubbels
havent
really
been
my
favorite
style
as
they
always
seemed
a
bit
messy
to
me
in
terms
of
flavor
profiles
given
a
bit
more
time
and
more
experience
with
this
style
i
like
to
think
that
my
tastebuds
are
maturing
to
this
style
as
this
one
i
enjoyed
and
could
readily
appreaicate
some
of
the
subtler
nuances
of
this
beer
d
its
ok
not
sure
that
i
would
seek
this
out
again
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
its
all
there
was
the
head
fades
quickly
to
a
sturdy
surface
layer
leaving
some
tight
lattice
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
with
plums
and
red
grapes
and
raisins
mixing
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
fine
tingly
carbonation
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
dark
fruit
plums
and
raisins
and
a
bit
of
doughy
yeast
on
the
finish
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
with
no
hints
of
hops
or
abv
quite
a
nice
rich
enjoyable
brew
this
isnt
the
cloudsopenupandcry
beer
ive
been
hoping
for
from
the
abbey
but
its
another
id
happily
have
again
good
dubbel
with
a
unique
flavor
profile
an
interesting
enough
brew
one
that
i
would
have
been
glad
to
split
but
was
able
to
gradually
slowly
sip
away
a
nice
enough
attempt
at
the
style
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
smelling
more
than
drinking
there
is
a
rawnessgreenness
to
it
unfortunately
another
lost
abbey
that
falls
too
far
from
style
guidelines
which
could
be
ok
but
flavors
do
not
integrate
well
at
all
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
deliver
the
last
blow
d
this
one
grew
on
me
quite
a
bit
as
i
was
drinking
it
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
fizzy
inch
of
biscuity
tan
head
fades
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
body
is
a
very
deep
consistant
prune
like
brown
in
color
you
get
some
crisp
dark
fruit
up
front
on
the
nose
then
comes
the
toffee
malts
all
wraped
up
in
spicy
yeast
that
same
spicy
yeast
feel
is
the
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
take
first
sip
this
is
a
more
dusty
dry
spice
feel
though
there
is
a
consistant
dark
fruit
sweetness
full
of
fresh
raisens
and
plum
on
the
back
of
the
palate
this
brew
really
does
get
better
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
very
yeasty
thick
with
some
even
sweetness
sweetness
is
lingering
and
hurts
the
drinkability
slightly
flavor
is
sweet
and
tart
indeed
raisinlike
tastes
good
although
kind
of
delicatelight
nice
balance
of
malt
to
fruit
feels
pretty
good
full
side
of
thin
bodied
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
red
purplishprune
color
with
nice
sized
offwhite
foam
head
that
settes
into
a
lasting
lacing
aroma
is
dominated
by
dark
fruit
with
a
nice
alcohol
presence
perfect
blend
of
maltiness
and
sweet
dark
fruit
flavors
such
as
raisin
date
prune
and
fig
with
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
amazing
beer
sipping
reveals
plenty
of
dried
dark
fruits
such
as
fig
and
raisin
comes
of
less
sweet
than
anticipated
given
the
scent
finishes
with
a
semi
dry
spiciness
paired
with
a
warming
alcohol
presence
and
tobacco
medium
bodied
and
less
carbonated
than
some
of
its
belgian
counterparts
this
unique
dubbel
comes
off
as
an
interesting
mix
of
dubbel
and
old
ale
i
had
hoped
for
a
little
more
from
this
famed
brewery
but
it
is
surely
a
beer
worth
trying
good
beer
ive
been
looking
forward
to
drinking
a
lost
abbey
beer
for
a
long
time
this
is
my
first
one
and
although
it
is
a
good
beer
i
expected
it
to
be
better
i
do
taste
the
raisins
and
it
does
have
a
unique
flavor
but
after
visiting
dogfish
head
i
dont
think
its
as
complex
or
tasty
as
some
of
their
beers
has
a
great
flavor
and
a
great
after
taste
i
was
just
hoping
for
more
improves
as
it
warms
and
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
most
dubbels
ive
had
which
i
feel
it
shares
color
and
some
of
the
flavor
profile
my
expectations
were
probably
unreachable
and
it
met
about
80
of
it
drinkability
couldnt
have
more
than
one
or
maybe
two
in
a
sitting
this
one
is
a
slow
sipper
notes
from
91808
overall
quite
unimpressive
and
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
lost
abbey
beers
ive
had
not
quite
a
drainpour
but
absolutely
not
something
id
buy
again
i
have
to
wonder
at
the
ratings
on
this
beer
and
whether
it
gets
some
high
ones
due
to
a
certain
degree
of
beer
geek
adoration
that
la
enjoys
hv
drinkability
is
okay
a
pretty
good
dubbel
a
bit
sugary
for
the
style
but
it
suits
my
taste
nicely
great
esters
and
well
made
a
rusty
amber
pour
with
a
big
creamy
head
that
seems
to
remain
forever
light
refreshing
scents
of
sweet
fruits
slightly
dark
some
raisin
and
fig
of
course
with
a
brown
and
candy
sugar
presence
caramel
and
a
light
spice
also
apparent
flavor
is
very
rich
when
compared
to
the
nose
much
more
full
than
expected
big
and
malty
with
the
fruits
and
lots
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
also
some
chocolate
light
yeast
and
spice
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
as
well
creamy
full
mouth
with
a
spicy
finish
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
again
decent
drinkability
seems
like
an
after
dinner
drink
to
me
nothing
spectacular
here
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
tons
of
flavor
and
another
great
beer
by
lost
abbey
d
another
solid
beer
from
lost
abbey
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
beers
this
style
and
this
is
a
fantastic
domestic
version
of
the
dubbel
style
recommended
a
very
enjoyable
dubbel
and
i
will
certainly
pick
it
up
again
when
lost
abbey
hits
chicago
poured
a
burnt
orange
color
on
the
pour
with
a
small
tannish
head
nose
was
sticky
w
dried
fruitsprunes
raisinsfigs
lots
of
caramel
and
candied
fruits
brown
sugar
taste
was
sweet
and
rummy
lots
of
dried
fruits
and
sweet
candy
i
found
it
hard
to
drink
and
not
tasty
at
all
i
thought
the
taste
was
ob
noxious
and
unpleasant
i
am
not
sure
how
anyone
could
finish
a
bottle
of
this
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
was
missing
a
solid
flavor
to
it
id
recommend
if
you
can
easily
get
but
dont
kill
yourself
getting
it
excellent
depiction
of
the
genre
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
sampled
period
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
brews
from
portlost
abbey
d
not
the
best
dubbel
but
boy
that
aroma
pours
darker
than
i
was
expecting
with
a
reddish
hue
to
it
smell
is
dark
fruits
but
to
my
pleasant
surprise
there
was
a
bit
of
sourness
to
it
this
has
a
huge
mouthfeel
and
is
very
pleasant
there
are
plenty
of
juicy
dark
fruits
in
this
offering
this
may
be
my
favorite
lost
abbey
beer
to
date
you
never
notice
the
abv
the
complexity
in
this
beer
is
very
nice
and
everything
works
wonderul
together
very
well
done
d
a
decent
dubbel
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
better
ones
on
the
market
and
slightly
bland
and
boring
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
demonstrating
that
americans
are
coming
into
their
own
capable
of
brewing
a
superior
belgian
while
hinting
at
possibilities
of
the
us
turning
the
style
into
its
own
as
it
has
with
so
many
other
styles
drinkability
is
very
good
as
well
and
if
it
were
lower
in
alcohol
i
could
drink
it
all
night
im
glad
i
tried
the
bottle
which
more
than
made
up
for
the
disgusting
tap
experience
not
sure
why
all
that
sediment
was
in
that
one
i
would
have
taken
it
back
but
the
toronado
bartenders
are
so
surly
they
probably
would
have
kicked
me
out
of
the
bar
for
complaining
reviewed
this
before
out
of
the
bottle
this
time
im
reviewing
it
on
tap
at
toronado
in
san
francisco
pours
a
murky
brown
with
no
real
head
but
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
but
there
is
some
earthiness
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
rich
and
chocolaty
with
typical
belgian
yeast
flavors
of
clove
herbal
flavors
pear
and
banana
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
extremely
easy
to
drink
doesnt
come
as
well
as
in
the
bottle
as
far
as
appearance
or
aroma
goes
but
perhaps
superior
in
smoothness
and
flavor
on
tap
d
very
drinkable
i
normally
nurse
belgian
styles
but
this
was
going
down
quite
easy
smooth
as
silk
and
a
very
satisfying
body
and
level
of
carbonation
easily
drinkable
and
an
amazing
beer
easily
one
of
if
not
the
best
belgianstyle
beers
in
america
in
fact
it
could
possibly
be
that
the
capital
of
belgium
is
located
not
in
flanders
but
north
county
sd
d
pangs
of
regret
filled
me
when
the
bottle
was
emptied
luckily
this
one
is
easier
to
find
that
a
lot
of
the
lost
abbeys
offerings
a
good
dubbel
d
this
a
nice
beer
and
i
recommend
it
to
someone
who
has
never
tasted
a
beer
that
has
been
brewed
with
raisens
in
it
pours
a
murky
mahogany
color
average
sized
tan
head
fades
into
a
14
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
a
few
stray
spots
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
raisins
brown
bread
some
sweet
molasses
taste
is
very
rich
malt
sweetdark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
just
a
nice
hint
of
alcohol
mediumbodied
relatively
fizzy
carbonation
some
nice
lingering
spice
this
is
tasty
nothing
too
overwhelming
and
this
would
pair
really
nicely
with
food
would
like
this
at
port
brewery
on
tap
next
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
an
opaque
reddishbrown
color
there
was
a
decent
sized
tan
head
on
the
pour
but
it
dropped
away
rather
quickly
very
nice
nose
raisins
rum
caramel
slight
spiciness
a
mix
of
some
other
fruits
and
some
other
unidentifiable
sources
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
good
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
there
but
you
can
pick
out
some
raisin
caramel
dark
fruits
and
i
believe
a
touch
of
roastiness
just
trying
to
peak
out
very
nice
d
excellent
i
cant
wait
to
break
out
my
next
bottle
and
will
be
ordering
more
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
style
abv
one
you
could
savor
all
night
if
lucky
enough
to
find
it
in
quantity
a
good
bordering
on
great
dubbel
nuff
said
would
happily
drink
again
not
a
mindblowing
dubbel
but
a
pretty
good
one
in
my
opinion
and
a
good
first
experience
with
the
lost
abbey
d
nice
beer
after
older
viscosity
it
went
down
a
little
to
easy
perfect
example
of
the
style
spot
on
actually
nice
beer
too
bad
it
is
hard
to
come
by
in
ny
750ml
bottle
from
south
bay
pours
a
deep
copper
amber
with
a
beige
head
that
leaves
only
minimal
lacing
as
it
recedes
smell
is
huge
with
dark
fruits
plums
and
figs
also
spicy
and
bready
taste
is
big
with
figs
and
raisins
also
some
nice
bready
malt
finish
is
sweet
with
a
fruity
aftertaste
really
delicious
mouthfeel
is
good
but
to
nitpick
id
like
a
little
more
carbonation
to
help
clean
off
some
of
the
sweetness
as
a
result
drinkability
suffers
but
only
slightly
great
brew
yet
again
from
lost
abbey
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
belgian
dubbel
not
quite
world
class
but
still
very
solid
and
worth
a
try
thanks
to
tradehops
for
this
one
my
bottle
reads

interesting

the

cinnamon
toast
nuts
raisins
sweets
root
beer
candies
and
maybe
some

slightly
spicy
flavor
and
the
raisins
are
present
d
i
expected
a
little
more
out
of
this
one
and
felt
it
could
have
been
a
winter
wheat
wine
the
esters
were
not
very
apparent
either
if
i
lived
where
this
is
sold
it
would
find
its
way
in
my
dbf
with
regularity
pours
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thin
creme
head
that
falls
to
nothing
pretty
fast
nice
sugary
and
spicy
nose
i
really
do
wish
i
knew
my
spices
better
because
i
feel
like
i
should
be
able
to
pinpoint
this
somehow
flavor
is
smoothly
sweet
though
a
tad
of
tang
is
there
spices
are
clearly
evident
but
dont
overpower
its
got
some
nice
character
to
it
feel
has
a
fairly
full
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
decent
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
there
is
some
good
character
on
it
and
its
definitely
not
boring
mind
blowing
no
nice
to
drink
sure
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
from
lost
abbey
there
was
a
nice
touch
of
dark
fruit
and
a
really
great
light
profile
this
was
just
another
in
a
long
series
of
solid
brews
from
tomme
and
company
i
was
again
just
thought
this
was
wonderful
definitely
one
of
the
best
dubbels
i
have
had
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
in
light
of
the
fact
that
i
will
be
doing
a
trade
soon
for
another
lost
abbey
brew
pour
is
interesting
in
that
there
is
little
to
no
heading
but
the
look
of
it
is
still
worth
noting
looks
very
thick
and
murky
color
is
a
reddish
brown
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
at
the
same
time
with
essences
of
dark
stone
fruits
cracked
pepper
and
an
appealing
boozy
character
taste
really
shows
off
the
raisin
puree
created
for
this
beer
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
other
fruits
lingering
in
the
background
feel
is
on
the
medium
side
and
is
just
about
right
for
this
style
one
bottle
was
far
too
easy
to
suck
down
i
like
the
fact
that
despite
this
is
a
sweet
dubbel
it
is
not
overkill
with
lots
of
other
complexities
to
consider
a
good
american
interpretation
of
this
style
bring
on
gotm
d
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
lost
abbeys
ive
had
d
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
beer
i
wonder
if
this
is
one
that
would
grow
better
with
a
little
more
time
in
the
bottle
very
good
beer
overall
md
full
bodied
other
then
a
dry
quality
the
alcohol
is
hidden
carbonation
right
on
spot
fair
drinkability
as
well
overall
a
solid
beer
a
little
different
then
most
dubbles
i
have
had
im
a
huge
fan
of
port
brewing
companythe
lost
abbey
and
am
not
about
to
hold
a
less
than
optimally
carbonated
beer
against
them
rest
assured
that
i
will
locate
another
lost
found
abbey
ale
one
of
these
days
and
will
no
doubt
increase
the
scores
to
their
rightful
places
soon
thereafter
pours
a
muddy
caramel
color
with
some
yeast
in
the
glass
nice
beige
head
smell
is
oddly
refreshing
and
minty
with
some
alcohol
presence
taste
is
rather
mundane
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
light
malt
flavor
and
again
an
alcohol
presence
that
comes
through
as
almost
minty
again
drinkable
and
not
really
offensinve
as
the
flavor
is
so
mild
but
nothing
really
screamed
great
beer
about
this
one
to
me
i
need
to
grab
a
few
bottles
and
let
them
sit
for
3
to
6
years
then
this
will
be
perfect
when
it
really
shows
up
its
winelike
qualities
dark
brown
small
head
settles
down
quickly
easily
revived
with
a
swirl
of
the
glass
good
retention
as
well
raisin
in
the
aroma
dark
malts
dark
sugars
very
fruity
with
dark
fruits
dominant
a
dark
dubble
true
to
style
but
for
me
it
doesnt
add
up
to
anything
overly
impressive
mouthfeel
and
carboantion
levels
are
both
good
drinkability
is
not
the
best
for
me
as
i
just
kinda
find
this
one
of
the
more
boring
example
of
the
style
now
benediction
on
the
other
hand
d
drinks
pretty
easy
for
a
dubbel
and
the
lower
abv
helps
that
the
brew
was
tasty
but
not
as
as
potent
at
most
are
though
the
alcohol
was
more
so
haha
weird
i
know
since
there
are
better
and
readily
available
dubbels
in
my
area
i
probably
wont
go
back
to
this
glad
i
could
try
it
and
was
definitely
worth
my
time
thanks
again
chris
i
picked
up
a
bottle
at
the
table
vine
in
springfield
ma
by
every
sense
i
employed
i
would
have
guessed
this
to
be
ommegang
in
a
blind
taste
test
thats
a
good
thing
just
not
too
original
and
a
lot
pricier
from
the
lost
abbey
the
beer
is
dark
brown
colored
hazy
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
dark
fruits
figs
plums
raisins
and
some
sweet
esters
the
taste
is
the
same
possibly
a
hint
of
anise
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
water
but
not
overly
so
easily
drinkable
nice
overall
but
ommegang
is
a
better
price
and
similar
experience
good
flavor
throughout
but
just
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
came
through
which
prevented
this
one
from
ranking
higher
on
the
drinkability
meter
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
a
reddish
brown
smell
is
sweet
fruits
cloves
and
molasses
taste
was
more
the
same
but
a
little
muted
this
was
a
good
beer
but
whenever
i
drink
it
i
get
the
feeling
it
is
missing
just
a
little
something
to
make
it
great
and
that
it
would
be
good
blended
with
a
sour
beer
i
therefore
am
not
surprised
to
learn
that
this
serves
as
a
base
for
some
other
great
lost
abbey
beers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
forward
carbonation
that
works
really
well
into
the
overall
beer
an
easy
drinking
dubbel
that
is
nice
and
flavorful
this
is
another
enjoyable
brew
from
lost
abbey
if
you
can
get
this
locally
and
easy
you
should
feel
lucky
as
this
is
one
i
would
definitely
drink
again
in
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
im
somewhat
surprised
to
see
so
many
distinct
ingredients
in
other
reviws
unlike
most
lost
abbey
brews
i
find
this
beer
is
decidedly
onenote
and
that
note
is
pureed
raisins
mixed
with
roasted
malt
thats
about
it
maybe
a
hint
of
something
lighter
perhaps
grapefruit
or
pine
needles
beer
pours
a
pleasant
enough
reddish
hue
but
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
lost
abbey
pours
a
hazed
brownish
red
almost
rust
coloured
thin
off
white
head
forms
leaves
a
solid
ring
some
lace
spots
on
the
glass
smell
is
caramel
raisins
some
citrus
nice
malts
grains
figs
yeasty

light
chocolate
nice
taste
is
similar
very
raisiny
caramel
some
alcohol
light
chocolate
citrus
some
wood
dark
fruits
yeast
smooth
flavours
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
nice
to
drink
a
solid
dubbel
needed
to
try
this
so
i
could
compare
it
to
amazing
grace
when
i
crack
it
open
soon
not
great
but
a
decent
dubbel
would
pick
other
lost
abbey
beers
before
it
in
the
future
worth
a
try
though
d
very
drinkable
i
would
like
another
please
overall
a
nice
dubbel
with
a
great
nose
and
taste
lost
abbey
knows
what
they
are
doing
when
it
comes
to
belgian
brews
and
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
class
defiently
worth
the
try
overall
this
is
a
great
abbeystyle
ale
and
the
use
of
raisins
is
a
real
highlight
easily
the
best
dubbel
that
ive
had
from
a
us
brewery
d
this
is
really
an
excellent
dubbel
it
has
all
the
elements
of
a
good
belgian
and
the
raisin
compote
gives
it
an
added
dimension
that
you
dont
always
see
probably
tlas
best
yearround
brew
one
bottle
has
me
pretty
buzzed
so
i
dont
know
that
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
but
it
can
be
sipped
or
drank
a
little
faster
awesome
stuff
im
glad
i
can
find
this
locally
decent
mouthfeel
i
wish
i
could
recommend
it
more
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgians
i
can
see
how
people
would
really
like
this
for
a
beer
style
im
not
to
into
it
does
have
a
lot
of
flavor
beer
poured
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
quickly
dissapated
nose
is
of
molasses
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
of
those
belgian
yeast
molasses
candied
sugar
and
perhaps
a
dark
fruit
mouthfeel
is
nicely
conditioned
by
the
yeast
strain
as
it
glides
easily
across
my
palate
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
not
an
overly
complex
brew
for
the
style
but
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
nice
representation
of
style
the
subdued
character
which
works
so
well
as
a
base
for
other
lost
abbey
blends
seems
almost
here
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
chose
over
most
of
the
other
lost
abbey
line
pours
a
cloudy
deep
amber
color
with
a
light

the
aroma
sour

just
a

quite
high
a
very
good
belgian

dubbel
i
am
impressed
with
my
first
taste
from
the
lost
abbey
this
left
me
looking
for
and
wanting
more
the
lost
abbey
truly
is
the
perfect
name
wow
tasty
treat
dupple
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
pillowy
offwhite
one
finger
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
everlasting
bubbles
stickiness
is
mediocre
but
there
smell
is
sweet
caramel
apple
with
a
rich
raisin
aroma
full
of
thick
malt
in
the
nose
very
enjoyable
not
too
yeasty
in
the
nose
just
how
i
like
my
belgians
a
faint
floral
perfume
scent
tickles
the
senses
as
well
creamy
dark
fruits
up
front
on
the
tongue
raisin
dates
plum
and
cherries
some
biscuit
flavors
and
walnuts
as
well
caramel
sweetness
throughout
with
a
mild
vanilla
aftertaste
solid
belgian
flavor
brewed
in
the
good
us
of
a
fluffy
cloud
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
carbonation
very
close
to
the
westy
8
in
texture
damn
good
amazing
how
this
one
goes
down
for
8
lost
abbey
clearly
knows
what
their
doing
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
looking
forward
to
trying
the
amazing
grace
this
one
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
cream
coloured
head
the
cap
was
a
bit
thin
and
made
up
of
fine
bubbles
it
eventually
settled
to
a
ring
and
produced
some
sticky
lace
the
aroma
was
full
of
cakey
doughy
malt
and
dried
fruit
raisins
mostly
there
was
also
some
yeast
character
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavour
was
a
combination
of
malt
and
fruit
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
sort
of
like
a
fruitcake
it
was
quite
bready
with
mild
chocolate
and
cocoa
notes
along
with
sweet
prunes
cherries
and
sultana
raisins
in
the
finish
mediumlight
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
the
bubbles
were
wellintegrated
and
quite
fine
the
texture
was
quite
good
with
a
little
warmth
throughout
very
tasty
overall
even
though
the
alcohol
was
always
present
it
was
never
distracting
or
hot
i
really
enjoyed
the
rich
dried
fruit
character
too
definitely
a
winner
d
nice
dubbel
with
a
decent
kick
pleasant
flavor
and
reasonably
complex
profile
i
will
keep
a
couple
in
my
stash
for
tasting
in
a
year
or
so
this
one
will
improve
with
age
edit
with
the
last
pour
the
appearance
immediately
became
cloudy
due
to
the
sediment
and
that
always
means
for
me
a
better
score
in
appearance
for
the
style
also
all
of
the
flavours
seem
to
have
intensified
bringing
much
more
goodness
to
my
palate
why
is
it
that
the
bottom
third
of
a
bottle
of
a
belgian
or
belgian
style
ale
always
is
the
best
part
of
the
bottle
anywho
ive
adjusted
my
rating
accordingly
d
glad
i
had
some
help
from
alhrabosky
for
this
one
while
i
enjoyed
this
well
enough
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
the

thats
sweet
and
full

as
well
as
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
the

provides
a
wonderful

as
the

passes
onto

with

your

your

detect
something
very

10
commandmentsjudgment
day
this
is
a
very
solid
belgianstyle
dubbel
from
a
highly
respected
socal
brewery
i
would
definitely
recommend
picking
this
up
i
believe
lf
is
the
prototypical
l
a
beer
and
look
forward
to
reviewing
10
commandments
shortly
i
think
this
is
the
best
u
s
dubbel
style
i
have
ever
tried
now
that
ive
tried
thisi
will
pick
up
some
more
la
beers
next
time
i
need
my
belgian
fix
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
from
drinking
this
beer
fast
is
typing
this
review
its
very
drainkable
and
i
dont
feel
the
effects
yet
and
im
on
my
first
glass
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
interpretation
of
the
style
while
being
unique
highly
recomended
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
clear
but
dark
brown
slightly
red
with
an
airy
but
dense
thick
head
the
head
formed
very
easily
on
this
the
smell
is
almost
winelike
probably
because
of
the
raisins
alcohol
might
be
there
slightly
the
taste
is
very
good
malty
with
a
dark
fruity
sweetness
at
the
start
finishing
with
an
earthiness
reminiscent
of
belgian
beers
thanks
ppoitras
for
the
opportunity
pours
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
foamy
offwhite
head
that
starts
off
about
an
inch
thick
with
very
good
head
retention
and
an
almost
continuous
lace
up
the
back
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
lightly
malty
and
sour
with
clear
ripe
fruit
overtones
though
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
a
specific
fruit
also
maybe
a
little
bread
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
where
this
one
really
shines
nicely
balanced
slightly
bitter
initial
flavor
that
has
the
expected
yeast
sourness
of
a
belgian
style
ale
interesting
warm
fruity
aftertaste
that
reminds
me
of
rum
the
aftertaste
morphs
into
a
more
sour
malty
flavor
that
is
a
little
bitter
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
it
is
nice
and
fullbodied
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
sudsy
in
texture
though
it
didnt
bother
me
until
i
got
to
considering
it
for
the
review
overall
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
that
should
definitely
be
tried
the
yeast
sourness
and
ripe
fruit
aromas
and
flavors
are
clear
but
there
is
an
interesting
flavornose
between
initial
flavor
and
aftertaste
that
i
had
trouble
describing
like
every
lost
abbey
brew
i
have
had
this
is
well
worth

up

but
the

simply
i
wanted
more
of
what
the

brought
to
the

the

is
chunky

very

does
its
part
to
limit
the
drinkability
it
once
was
lost
and
now
its
found
i
guess
and
im
okay
with
that
but
im
surely
not
awed
4
or
5
on
tap
definitely
bottle
poured
a
deep
cloudy
brown
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
dry
fruits
and
candi
sugar
is
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
sweet
malt
with
candi
sugar
and
some
notes
of
dry
figs
and
raisins
are
also
noticeable
body
is
quite
full
with
some
good
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
was
discernable
i
thought
this
was
well
done
overall
but
lacked
some
complexities
to
take
it
to
a
greater
level
a
great
dubbel
only
limited
in
my
view
by
the
purchase
price
of
11
65
a
nice
dubbel
but
a
bit
excessive
in
the
alcohol
flavor
department
the
aroma
is
wonderful
but
it
could
benefit
from
having
those
differing
flavors
mirrored
to
some
extent
in
the
taste
im
not
sure
if
ill
pick
up
this
one
again
but
this
has
piqued
my
interest
in
trying
other
lost
abbey
beers
the
beer
is
a
bit
simple
and
one
dimensional
on
the
palate
but
the
flavors
are
very
nice
making
this
a
fun
beer
to
drink
another
solid
effort
from
port
brewing
the
beer
is
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
one
finger
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
and
raisins
and
is
very
sweet
there
is
a
bit
of
spice
to
the
flavor
along
with
the
malt
and
raisin
flavor
it
is
a
bit
too
spicy
for
my
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
it
is
fairly
light
bodied
it
is
a
good
decent
overall
strong
spicy
flavors
up
front
almost
gingery
the
flavor
settles
into
nice
brown
malts
im
thinking
dark
crystal
and
some
chocolate
malt
strong
alcohol
oiliness
which
is
surprising
given
the
content
good
body
with
very
high
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
a
little
too
sweet
on
the
finish
but
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
the
very
complex
flavors
are
balanced
and
smooth
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
nice
attempt
at
the
style
i
will
have
a
chimay
premi√®re
and
westmalle
dubbel
over
the
next
week
or
so
in
order
to
compare
the
beer
arrived
in
a
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bomber
and
looked
brownish
orange
in
color
when
poured
the
head
atop
it
was
beige
a
little
shy
of
two
finger
thick
and
craggy
the
smell
was
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
with
a
floral
and
soured
fruit
profile
the
taste
was
sweet
and
rummy
and
not
quite
as
dry
as
the
true
belgian
examples
ive
sampled
before
the
carbonation
was
prickly
in
the
mouth
as
result
of
the
thinner
than
normal
body
and
the
alcohol
was
also
quite
evident
despite
some
of
these
flaws
making
this
a
little
abnormal
for
the
style
i
found
it
was
an
overall
enjoyable
beer
750
ml
bottle
color
of
reddish
mahogany
with
a
thick
small
bubbled
tan
head
nose
of
spices
orange
cloves
yeast
bright
red
fruit
brown
sugar
malts
and
beef
broth
¬ñ
taste
of
red

cloves

red

and

body
is
medium
smooth
and
with
high
carbonation
¬ñ
aftertaste
of
red
fruit
molasses
and
light
hops
dnot
bad
for
the
style
though
something
appears
to
be
amiss
here
not
quite
sure
what
it
is
i
would
try
this
again
though
drinkability
hits
reall
hard
for
a
dubbel
and
has
the
most
flavor
ive
ever
had
per
style
besides
maybe
westy
8
nice
company
for
sure
as
that
was
my
favorite
dubbel
matched
if
not
better
than
my
previous
favorite
amercian
dubbel
rr
benediction
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
thats
worthy
of
a
beer
purchase
and
a
good
beer
over
all
its
not
one
of
the
top
beers
for
the
style
though
all
in
all
a
strong
brew
especially
for
a
california
dubbel
however
it
really
lacks
confidence
the
flavors
are
all
enjoyable
but
perhaps
too
well
rounded
nothing
stands
out
the
color
is
moderate
even
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
long
enough
to
enjoy
it
definitely
has
some
potential
for
aging
but
it
wont
ever
be
spectacular
something
which
i
have
no
doubt
this
brewery
is
capable
of
producting
drinkability
this
is
tough
while
i
could
drink
more
of
these
because
its
relatively
easy
to
drink
theres
not
manyt
reasons
why
i
would
want
to
maybe
to
see
if
the
second
is
better
than
the
first
what
a
great
tasting
beer
poured
into
my
tulip
glass
with
a
dark
raisin
color
topped
off
with
a
fairly
decent
lingering
tan
head
this
is
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
yet
with
banana
bread
hitting
you
right
away
followed
by
malts
and
brown
sugar
this
beer
could
be
made
into
incense
tasted
of
dark
fruits
the
raisin
mixture
they
add
contributes
to
some
great
flavoring
malt
and
again
subtle
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
fresh
wheat
bread
the
mouth
feel
was
fairly
substantial
but
the
beer
is
so
good
that
two
22oz
bottles
wouldnt
be
a
problem
pairs
with
the
usual
dubbel
suspects
mild
flavorful
cheeses
though
it
would
be
a
great
after
dinner
finisher
enjoy
mouthfeel
is
full
with
the
massive
tiny
carbonation
altogether
a
solid
effort
by
the
wonderful
folks
at
lost
abbey
this
was
one
of
the
sweetest
belgium
beers
i
ever
had
on
tap
at
solena
beach
i
declined
a
bottle
purchase
it
is
amber
red
with
lots
of
lace
very
fresh
fresh
yeast
aroma
will
it
get
less
candy
after
ageing
that
would
help
good
body
but
only
sweetness
dominates
and
it¬ís
cloying
this
offering
from
the
lost
abbey
pours
a
clear
auburn
with
small
carbonation
bubbles
throughout
that
leave
a
thick
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
funky
sour
horse
blanket
caramel
vanilla
some
pepper
and
nice
herbal
spices
throughout
the
nose
the
taste
starts
sweet
upfront
caramel
malt
bomb
dark
pitted
fruit
plums
raisins
followed
by
a
sour
unripened
twang
in
the
finish
this
overall
beer
is
good
a
little
alcohal
strong
for
7
that
could
mellow
possible
with
age
sampled
from
bottle
at
the
monks
cafe
lost
abbey
dinner
the
other
night
this
was
paired
along
side
the
amazin
grace
brew
the
beer
poured
a
deep
amber
colored
body
with
a
medium
thickness
tan
head
the
nose
has
a
malty
sweet
character
with
some
fruits
notes
to
boot
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
nice
malt
profile
and
some
dried
fruit
characters
as
well
d
low
abv
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
soft
on
the
palate
an
excellent
dubbel
even
at
the
price
well
worth
the
it
glad
i
snagged
this
when
i
did
drinkability
is
excellent
one
of
the
better
lost
abbey
beers
and
a
quite
authentic
belgian
dubbel
d
this
is
a
very
tasting
brew
and
glad
i
got
one
for
myself
nearly
didnt
i
will
be
picking
more
of
this
up
next
time
i
go
down
to
cali
one
bomber
of
this
is
more
than
enough
beer
for
one
night
and
while
the
beer
is
definitely
above
average
and
especially
worthy
of
praise
for
a
californiamade
dubbel
i
dont
have
any
burning
desire
to
try
it
again
any
time
soon
however
given
that
the
alcohol
burn
is
the
main
deterrent
this
may
be
the
perfect
candidate
to
go
into
hibernation
for
6
months
to
a
year
or
so
and
see
how
it
ages
the
body
is
thick
and
creamy
with
a
fairly
sharp
and
prickly
carbonation
very
enjoyable
could
be
more
drinkable
without
the
slight
bitter
aftertaste
of
pennies
poured
in
a
heavy
glass
chalice
formed
a
12
tan
head
over
the
clear
burgundy
brew
head
dwindles
quickly
and
loudly
not
unlike
a
sodas
froth
with
no
lacing
whatsoever
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
sedate
dark
fruitiness
taste
is
malty
upfront
with
spicing
coming
on
strong
in
the
middle
carrying
on
to
the
close
where
the
fruit
enters
the
picture
as
well
mouthfeel
seems
carbonated
to
a
fault
hard
to
get
a
handle
on
the
flavors
around
all
the
bubbles
on
the
tongue
and
reasonably
nice
and
drinkable
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
a
sturdy
representative
of
the
style
highly
recommended
beer
is
good
happy
dubbel
beering
very
effervescent
on
the
tongue
and
perfect
for
the
upcoming
holidays
ill
be
aging
several
bottles
of
this
to
see
how
it
comes
out
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
some
of
this
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
ruby
red
in
appearance
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
nose
is
spicy
and
bready
with
hints
of
figgish
fruit
my
first
impression
of
the
flavor
was
that
it
was
big
and
nicely
wellrounded
slightly
sweet
and
bready
with
toasty
caramel
malts
hints
of
molasses
and
a
cinnamon
and
balanced
hop
finish
substantial
but
not
overwhelming
in
mouthfeel
a
good
beer
with
decent
complexity
mouth
very
malt
forward
yet
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
imply
actually
a
little
strange
its
somewhat
dry
up
front
and
has
a
wet
finish
roast
malt
flavors
touched
up
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
give
this
one
a
lasting
after
taste
up
front
theres
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
though
its
really
enjoyable
and
drinkable
also
mouthfeel
though
it
enters
quite
aggressively
but
the
time
it
reaches
the
back
its
settled
and
feels
a
bit
weak
d
nice
beer
good
drinkability
a
bit
too
sweet
which
might
chill
out
with
age
still
worth
trying
of
the
two
i
purchased
the
avant
garde
was
the
winner
but
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
a
firstrate
dubbel
which
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
cellar
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
but
far
from
the
best
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
weak
in
comparison
but
decent
overall
definitely
worth
a
try
or
two
although
i
probably
wont
buy
this
one
again
notes
this
is
right
down
the
description
line
for
the
style
and
comes
through
with
flying
colors
rich
malts
with
some
fruity
tones
and
enough
roasted
characteristics
to
keep
things
somewhat
in
check
and
with
depth
good
overall
whilst
i
felt
a
little
let
down
by
the
earlier
¬ëavant
garde¬í
the
¬ëlost
found¬í
is
a
far
better
offering
and
has
the
background
and
depth
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
port
brewing
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
in
fact
i
just
may
tomorrow
something
tells
me
that
this
will
be
better
fresh
though
i
wouldn¬ít
leave
this
one
in
the
cellar
drinkability
¬ñ
this
is
not
a
big
monster
belgian
it
goes
down
well
and
quite
easy
and
is
a
good
one
for
sharing
maybe
with
someone
new
to
the
style
this
goes
down
easy
but
i
am
having
more
fun
sipping
it
slowly
nice
to
have
a
flavorful
belgian
clocking
in
at
a
mere
7
i
can
quaff
this
infinitely
into
the
evening
one
bottle
left
and
its
gonna
sit
for
a
few
months
given
time
and
a
few
adjustments
overall
this
beer
will
be
world
class
pizza
port
edit
the
last
reviewer
said
the
same
thing
fuck
it
i
agree
cheers
to
lost
abbey
head
and
shoulders
above
the
painfully
mediocre
avant
garde
i
think
this
beer
might
make
a
decent
session
beer
it
dosent
seem
to
be
too
high
in
alcohol
and
the
flavor
is
not
too
aggressive
i
think
it
is
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
as
port
brewing
progresses
plenty
of
body
and
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
this
has
a
nice
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
cant
wait
to
go
back
and
have
another

what

should
taste
like
a
nice
dubbel
with
a
beautiful
brown
color
and
fair
amount
of
carbonation
bubbles
and
good
head
smell
was
fairly
neutral
with
nothing
really
standing
out
apart
from
some
bready
and
malty
aromas
very
little
sugar
tastes
or
sweetness
in
general
like
a
lot
of
dubbels
some
spicy
coriander
flavors
and
touch
of
dryness
but
the
taste
was
still
very
solid
and
enjoyable
if
not
a
tiny
bit
different
from
many
others
in
this
style
not
always
a
bad
thing
mouth
was
fairly
thin
but
still
fine
couldnt
figure
out
the
alcohol
content
but
it
seemed
to
heat
up
just
a
tad
as
beer
warmed
a
very
solid
belgian
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
again
mid
pack
beer
at
beligian
dubbel
prices
look
elsewhere
would
definitely
include
in
a
taste
off
and
id
try
again
still
a
midbelgique
is
still
a
decent
beer
overall
not
sure
of
the
age
but
the
sediment
really
kills
the
experience
of
this
beer
its
actually
a
very
drinkable
but
the
price
point
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
revisit
bottom
line
worth
a
look
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
good
taste
and
interesting
to
think
about
i
would
buy
this
again
and
may
even
pick
up
a
case
at
the
price
i
paid
still
highly
impressed
by
this
the
yeast
character
is
really
strong
but
super
pleasant
incredibly
impressive
beer
of
course
it
must
be
drunk
and
it
is
pretty
smooth
a
litle
dark
and
the
aftertaste
reminds
you
that
you
singed
up
for
belgian
this
really
is
a
great
experience
to
drink
a
great
belgian
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
still
well
carbonated
leading
to
a
really
pleasurable
overall
experience
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
a
real
nice
surprise
eric
enjoyable
and
good
to
very
good
but
certainly
not
world
class
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
mfd
feel
is
a
little
prickly
due
to
higher
carbonation
the
finish
is
belgian
yeast
and
a
esters
interesting
beer
which
was
tasty
and
very
easy
to
consume
i
liked
it
and
would
have
it
again
so
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
d
this
beer
has
a
darker
than
average
malt
profile
for
its
style
there
are
some
nice
toffee
and
brown
sugar
notes
but
they
might
work
better
in
an
english
porter
or
old
ale
than
they
do
in
this
dubbel
the
real
issue
with
this
beer
is
the
lack
of
carbonation
it
leaves
the
beer
seeming
thick
and
lifeless
on
the
palate
not
an
awful
beer
but
it
has
some
serious
flaws
and
it
is
a
disappointment
after
drinking
their
vastly
superior
witbier
drinkable
but
not
an
overly
exciting
beer
d
pretty
good
the
raisin
like
sweetness
is
pleasing
enough
and
i
found
the
bottom
of
the
goblet
without
too
much
problem
at
all
4
0
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
hit
the
spot
tonight
if
i
was
looking
for
a
dubbel
with
huge
flavor
i
would
pick
up
something
else
but
if
i
just
wanted
a
drinkable
dubbel
this
one
fits
the
bill
id
recommend
letting
it
warm
a
bit
before
drinking
it
though
straight
outta
the
fridge
its
not
at
its
best
d
a
very
drinkable
belgian
i
think
though
im
just
not
crazy
about
it
myself
d
i
could
have
several
of
these
very
sessionable
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
something
id
have
again
because
of
the
mouthfeel
howeverm
it
is
an
ok
representation
of
the
sytle
fairly
cheep
for
a
bottle
as
well
sterkens
dubbel
is
easily
above
average
and
almost
good
allaround
the
nose
and
the
body
could
use
a
little
attention
but
the
flavors
not
bad
at
all
a
little
more
noise
from
belgian
yeast
would
certainly
improve
that
aspect
a
little
but
its
muted
presence
doesnt
hurt
it
too
bad
theres
still
enough
flavor
to
go
around
all
in
all
its
pretty
good
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
spot
a
bottle
great
find
this
one
would
be
good
with
a
nice
porkchop
or
hearty
meatloaf
love
the
smell
color
and
taste
picked
up
a
4
pack
on
my
way
to
austin
and
just
tried
the
beer
just
now
overall
it
is
a
pretty
impressive
beer
wish
i
could
get
it
here
in
oklahoma
god
willing
i
will
one
day
smooth
beer
and
imagine
the
abv
is
on
the
higher
side
but
nothing
in
the
flavor
to
indicate
that
with
solid
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
this
beer
would
be
an
excellent
food
pairing
option
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
easy
to
drink
and
not
extremely
expensive
which
is
nice
ruby
brown
off
white
head
i
was
looking
for
something
a
little
darker
the
slightest
hop
aroma
dark
fruits
sweet
malt
an
almost
bitter
flavor
malts
come
afterward
some
green
vegetables
sort
of
boozy
good
mouthfeel
small
fizzy
bubbles
the
flavor
is
not
quite
right
for
me
but
fairly
drinkable
nice
tight
carbonation
at
least
date
consumed
19
nov
2008
d
these
are
drinkable
feel
like
some
decent
belgians
without
the
high
price
tag
here
you
go
im
guessing
this
is
about
a
6
abv
and
would
make
a
nice
session
belgian
to
be
followed
by
a
st
b
12
for
dessert
d
a
good
drinker
and
the
only
thing
that
stands
in
the
way
is
the
rather
light
featherweight
flavor
for
this
type
of
beer
not
bad
though
maybe
that
means
i
can
make
room
for
a
few
more
in
the
belly
interesting
dubbel
not
sure
how
old
it
is
but
it
popped
up
as
a
single
at
the
local
world
market
so
if
i
had
to
guess
id
say
it
has
been
around
the
block
a
few
times
rich
sweet
aroma
grainy
and
slightly
sour
light
brown
pour
decent
head
and
nice
lacing
solid
on
the
palate
easy
finish
flavor
is
sugary
and
warm
with
a
nice
malt
content
fresh
baked
breads
and
dark
fruits
are
reminiscent
not
too
bad
this
is
one
of
the
worst
examples
of
the
style
ive
experienced
even
gave
me
a
headache
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
though
i
dont
think
its
as
interesting
as
others
from
belgium
not
without
its
good
points
though
the
smell
is
grassy
herbal
and
sweet
the
taste
was
caramel
malts
and
was
smooth
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
hop
presence
it
was
lightly
spiced
but
didnt
make
itself
known
it
was
well
carbonated
and
that
little
bit
of
spice
hit
you
on
the
way
out
overall
an
excellent
dubbel
which
i
would
buy
again
mmm
juicy
but
with
smooth
caramel
candy
and
toffee
to
match
the
juice
reminds
of
welchs
grape
juice
with
tart
cherries
strawberries
and
a
hint
of
green
apple
thrown
in
this
one
finishes
with
a
neutral
not
really
sweet
or
bitter
aftertaste
and
a
touch
of
lingering
cutgrass
and
black
pepper
hops
flavors
the
body
is
medium
weight
and
theres
just
enough
carbonation
to
provide
a
refreshing
feel
worth
trying
and
underrated
imo
similar
to
grimbergen
dubbel
but
better
looking
at
the
bad
reviews
i
could
not
believe
we
drank
the
same
beer
my
guess
is
the
storing
condition
are
very
important
as
i
did
not
detect
any
skunkiness
no
fluffy
floating
stuff
either
another
thing
ive
noticed
is
that
all
bad
reviews
are
dated
last
year
maybe
a
bad
batch
strong
and
a
tad
sweet
but
still
tasty
subdued
aroma
is
earthy
with
a
wet
paper
tinge
taste
is
good
a
slightly
citric
introduction
melds
to
ripened
figs
prunes
and
other
dark
fruit
musty
citric
hop
bite
immediately
gives
way
to
some
darker
malt
flavors
prickly
alcohol
tinge
on
the
palate
with
an
almost
steel
like
edge
not
too
overpowering
though
slick
body
with
an
almost
watery
mouthfeel
feels
at
home
overall
a
pretty
solid
drinkable
beer
cheers
d
decent
overall
but
the
flavor
was
muted
and
drank
only
moderate
per
style
have
had
this
brew
in
the
fridge
for
a
number
of
months
and
thought
i
would
give
a
try
today
brew
pours
to
a
russet
brown
color
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
has
amazing
retention
but
lust
only
slight
lacing
the
aromas
of
this
brew
are
inviting
nice
malt
smell
wrapped
around
a
core
yeast
smell
some
fruit
smells
give
off
the
idea
of
sweetness
though
with
a
little
alcohol
also
in
the
mix
is
a
nice
spice
aroma
the
taste
is
quite
good
as
well
very
malty
up
front
giving
a
slight
toasted
like
flavor
slight
caramel
flavor
wrapped
in
with
the
toasted
flavors
very
good
carbonation
which
plays
with
the
hop
presence
to
tingle
the
back
of
the
mouth
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
imo
a
very
good
brew
while
i
am
not
sure
i
would
go
looking
for
this
as
it
is
not
so
outstanding
that
i
would
really
remember
it
i
would
be
happy
to
have
another
this
beer
poured
with
nearly
zero
head
and
yeast
clumps
were
rampant
despite
leaving
a
bit
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
there
is
a
nice
spicy
aroma
from
this
beer
but
perhaps
subdued
due
to
know
head
with
popping
bubbles
adding
to
the
pungency
first
taste
seems
to
be
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
does
lend
a
slight
spicyyeast
balance
but
unfortunately
its
seems
off
in
the
distance
again
the
watery
taste
also
reflects
in
the
mouthfeel
and
it
just
seems
too
light
for
a
dubbel
which
is
the
top
of
the
styles
i
like
due
to
the
lackluster
experience
the
drinkability
suffers
as
well
pours
a
dark
amberlight
brown
with
an
okay
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
strong
aroma
of
honey
quite
sweet
and
even
a
tiny
touch
of
smokiness
big
malt
presence
here
floral
as
well
taste
is
similar
this
is
a
malt
bomb
ther
is
a
bit
of
woodiness
and
some
more
of
the
floral
honey
notes
a
bit
sweet
and
light
for
a
dubbel
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
not
especially
creamy
or
full
decent
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
style
and
lacks
a
bit
of
depth
there
is
something
disjointed
with
the
sweetness
bitterness
and
maltiness
i
am
sure
this
could
be
a
good
beer
but
i
have
no
qualms
about
writing
a
review
when
i
get
an
off
beer
a
quality
control
review
if
you
will
if
you
get
this
beer
in
tallahassee
it
may
be
flat
or
either
it
is
always
flat
d
i
wont
finish
it
because
of
the
taste
the
smell
isnt
all
that
appealing
either
but
its
average
for
the
style
maybe
if
i
liked
drinking
hard
liquor
straight
i
would
enjoy
this
but
thats
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
beer
this
ended
up
being
pretty
drinkable
towards
the
end
in
spite
of
my
terrible
first
impression
still
it
has
an
off
taste
that
i
dont
care
for
and
i
will
probably
never
bother
with
this
again
thanks
for
the

it
has
a
rather
tame
flavour
profile
that
opens
up
only
slightly
as
it
warms
a
bit
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
pricky
due
to
the
medium
carbonation
the
overall
body
is
a
bit
light
for
the
style
too
drinkability
is
good
just
because
it
goes
down
easy
and
there
isnt
much
to
ponder
as
i
drink
it
very
average
to
below
average
id
say
for
the
style

from
the
330ml

glass
beautiful
color

with

a

this
beauty
and
lingers
for

as
the
ample
carbonation
continues
to
emanate
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
of
dry
funky
belgian

is
a

airy
and
dry
which
is
kind
of
incongruous
for
this
usually
heavy
style
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
one
the
wonderful
appearance
belies
its
rather
hohum
qualities
11

the

is

bready
with

much
like

smell
the
taste
is
sweet

with
dark
fruits
with
some
spice
and
hops
rounding
out
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
odd
dubbel
but
not
odd
in
a
bad
way
there
certainly
are
better
dubbels
out
there
but
i
have
had
worse

d

this
is
a

sipper
to
be

not
quaffed
but
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
i
couldnt
really
enjoy
this
one
the
beer
isnt
bad
its
just
not
in
my
range
i
feel
i
have
had
much
better
dubbels
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
i
wish
i
had
read
a
few
of
the
reviews
before
i
poured
because
now
there
are
a
few
chuncks
of
sediment
floating
in
the
glass
that
aside
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
copperfaint
red
with
no
head
and
very
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
but
seems
to
consist
mainly
of
the
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
suprisingly
alot
like
apple
cider
dark
fruit
flavors
with
a
little
spice
interesting
but
not
what
i
expect
from
a
dubbel
nonetheless
a
good
beer
light
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
quite
enjoyable
and
a
welcome
beer
during
a
session
i
was
slightly
surprised
how
cloudy
this
beer
was
for
a
dubble
it
had
a
good
brown
color
though
the
aroma
is
great
very
biscuity
and
malty
with
a
very
smooth
light
body
there
is
some
sweetness
but
it
is
overpowered
by
the
maltiness
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
it
isnt
the
among
the
best
dubbles
ive
had
poured
into
my
ommegang
chalice
from
the
bottle
there
isnt
much
head
to
speak
of
and
the
beer
is
rather
cloudy
the
beer
is
a
translucent
lighter
brown
very
yeastybready
aroma
other
notes
in
he
smell
include
sweet
cane
sugar
and
a
lightly
toasted
malt
the
taste
is
pleasant
round
sweet
with
fruity
and
nutty
undertones
definite
chocolate
maltiness
everything
is
great
except
for
the
fact
that
it
tastes
watered
down
there
isnt
a
full
rich
flavor
although
the
flavor
is
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
like
the
taste
rather
watery
leaving
it
thin
this
beer
would
be
so
much
better
if
it
was
more
dense
and
rich
this
is
drinkable
but
it
isnt
close
to
being
as
enjoyable
as
other
dubbels
ive
had
d
despite
the
watery
mouthfeel
and
just
above
average
scoring
for
the
other
areas
of
this
beer
its
pretty
easy
on
the
mouth
is
it
my
favorite
dubbel
not
even
close
but
it
disappeared
rather
quickly
from
the
glass
pours
a
deep
spoced
apple
cider
decent
carbonation
good
film
throughout
in
my
wide
mouth
gosse
island
wine
glass
lots
of
very
thick
clumpy
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
my
12oz
bottle
that
i
dumped
before
pouring
into
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
muted
toasted
and
very
lightly
roasted
malts
with
some
fainty
sweet
spices
the
taste
is
a
little
strained
for
a
dubbel
not
enough
in
the
adjective
of
dark
i
like
a
dark
tasting
dubbel
this
would
be
a
nice
everyday
dubbel
flavor
compared
to
most
just
not
up
to
par
for
a
better
than
just
good
dubbel
drinkability
one
of
the
top
beers
i
had
tried
so
far
not
sure
of
the
abv
but
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
over
and
over
and
i
think
i
shall
do
just
that
the
pour
delivers
a
copper
coloured
brew
with
no
head
to
bolster
it
it
has
a
few
random
bubbles
of
chubby
stature
that
pop
off
here
and
there
the
smell
is
terrific
caramel
candy
maybe
some
soured
dark
fruits
atypically
lacking
in
yeast
character
the
taste
is
light
and
caramel
slathered
a
bit
of
creaminess
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
the
drinkability
is
good
this
feels
like
a
belgian
macro
or
something
a
good
entry
level
belgian
hell
this
is
weird
not
bad
just
a
touch
unexpected
is
all
seems
a
bit
subdued
pours
reddish
brown
with
white
head
it
recedes
quickly
but
leaves
some
lace
smells
malty
with
fruits
taste
is
malt
moderate
to
light
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
alcohol
not
evident
like
it
is
in
a
lot
of
dubbels
not
bad
i
would
probably
drink
this
again
if
it
is
available
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
the
only
thing
i
found
offensive
was
it
smelled
of
alcohol
but
tasted
pretty
good
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
feel
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
and
a
decent
head
had
some
nice
belgian
candied
flavor
and
slight
pluminess
really
worth
a
try
and
fairly
priced
drinkability
this
beer
has
some
nice
elements
but
overall
i
am
underwhelmed
with
an
average
mouthfeel
of
fuzziness
id
love
this
beer
with
picnic
of
fried
chicken
and
a
side
of
beans
and
potato
salad
yummy
stuff
d
good
easy
down
sweet
and
nice
but
the
sediment
is
a
little
much
didnt
realize
how
thick
it
was
appearance
is
brownish
with
minimal
head
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
quite
light
maybe
a
touch
of
tartness
in
there
i
also
get
a
little
malt
on
the
palate
mild
raisin
malt
and
some
slight
spice
the
flavor
profile
is
good
but
altogether
i
find
it
a
little
held
back
this
is
a
decent
if
unspectacular
belgian
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
belgian
beer
chalice
an
absolutely
filthy
thin
beer
its
not
really
that
awful
but
its
far
from
a
quality
dubbel
the
hamms

i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
sterkens
white
ale
sterkens
dubbel
is
in
the
same
ballpark
likeabilitywise
from
first
sip
to
last
it
strikes
me
as
a
secondrate
dubbel
in
a
country
thats
brimming
with
plenty
of
firstrate
ones
i
get
no
comfort
from
the
fact
that
its
readily
available
in
my
quality
beer
starved
state
because
it
isnt
that
good
and
wont
be
entering
my
chalice
again
poured
out
to
a
cloudy
cherry
hazelnut
color
with
a
nice
18
inch
foamy
head
wads
of
sediment
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
mountains
of
lace
amid
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
malts
nuts
berries
earth
dough
and
sweet
grain
are
present
taste
was
not
as
intense
as
the
smell
but
still
quaffable
flavors
of
mild
spices
dough
grains
and
sweet
tea
not
bad
mouthfeel
was
accentuated
by
the
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
making
for
a
nice
edium
bodied
brew
decent
drinkability
this
brew
simply
lacked
enough
flavor
for
me
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
pours
out
a
reddishmahogany
color
with
a
light
head
atop
it
nose
is
fruity
lightly
malty
perhaps
a
tad
musty
first
taste
is
malty
somewhat
breadlike
with
a
plum
fruitiness
bitterness
is
a
little
higher
than
most
dubbels
but
well
within
the
style
with
a
piney
resinous
hop
flavor
finishes
simple
and
fairly
clean
neutral
texture
with
a
moderate
body
really
a
fairly
ordinary
belgium
beer
simple
and
uncomplex
but
still
drinkable
this
beer
is
usually
9
50
per
6
at
metzlers
here
in
denton
but
today
i
lucked
out
and
found
4
of
these
on
their
6
singles
for
6
rack
which
usually
is
loaded
w
budweiser
select
corona
light
and
something
called
thin
ice
which
looks
suspiciously
like
zima
again
ive
no
idea
as
to
what
the
abv
of
this
is
but
if
its
way
up
there
then
they
did
a
hell
of
a
job
hiding
it
big
smooth
malty
beer
ill
revisit
this
at
some
point
in
the
future
i
could
drink
another
but
would
rather
not
it
is
an
okay
beer
and
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
and
i
wouldnt
pay
a
premium
price
either
and
dont
buy
a
bunch
until
you
try
one
and
confirm
it
is
for
you
this
was
drinkable
but
disappointing
pours
with
one
finger
of
head
its
a
nice
golden
brown
color
and
mildly
hazy
theres
very
little
sediment
in
the
glass
the
flavor
is
almost
watery
the
aroma
is
made
up
of
sweet
malt
sugars
and
plum
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
toffee
tart
fruit
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
also
fairly
watery
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
decent
pours
a
cloudy
brownish
amber
color
with
lots
of
flakes
of
sediment
floating
throughout
the
beer
nose
is
sweet
dark
malts
and
toffee
along
with
a
tart
fruitiness
taste
begins
with
sweet
and
buttery
caramel
followed
by
some
earthiness
the
alcohol
becomes
more
pronounced
towards
the
finish
with
spicy
and
peppery
notes
blended
with
a
bitter
hop
twang
a
decent
enough
dubbel
but
nothing
really
remarkable
more
dark
fruit
caramel
and
molassas
a
slight
sting
from
the
carbonation
accompanied
by
a
bit
of
spice
all
in
all
a
decent
dubbel
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
overall
i
would
buy
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
to
drink
a
lot
of
belgian
beer
and
i
planned
to
start
with
something
better
first
not
an
awful
beer
by
most
standards
but
a
modest
one
by
belgian
standards
very
good
dubbel
for
the
price
picked
up
for
8
99
a
sixer
pours
a
medium

very
smooth
well
balanced
notes
of
chocolate

maybe
a
little
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
full
very
drinkable
beer
not
in
the
upper
echelon
of
dubbels
but
a
great
beer
for
the
price
that
i
will
continue
to
buy
and
enjoy
tastes
of
malt
hops
bit
of
caramel
and
hint
of
coriander
very
good
mouthfeel
the
malts
and
hops
dance
around
the
edges
of
the
tongue
with
the
adequate
carbonation
some
unpleasant
off
flavors
though
that
are
hard
to
pinpoint
pours
orange
brown
with
a
thin
white
bubbly
head
smells
of
very
sweet
candy
sugar
and
a
subtle
fruityness
tastes
of
candy
sweetness
nutty
and
a
little
bit
citric
lacking
any
of
the
fruityness
that
i
was
expecting
from
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
perhaps
overly
carbonated
very
uninspired
and
lacking
everything
i
would
expect
of
a
good
dubbel
head

the
bottle
is
full
of

the
beer
is

theres
a

i
first
had
this
brew
at
a

in
yocumtown
pa
its
become
a
tradition
for
me
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
every
time
i
go
there
they
have
over
600
different
bottles
at
this
place
that
should
tell

for

12oz
bottle
from
hoosick
street
discount
bev
troy
ny
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
off
white
foamy
head
the
head
was
massive
in
size
and
it
took
awhile
for
it
to
diminish
all
i
could
really
smell
was
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
really
sweet
in
the
nose
the
flavors
were
lacking
in
this
beer
the
thin
body
hurt
it
from
having
anything
that
i
would
call
depth
there
was
some
caramel
and
fruity
undertones
but
there
also
seemed
to
be
a
sour
medicinal
flavor
in
there
yuck
the
finish
was
dry
and
chalky
not
really
enjoyable
this
wasnt
really
a
dubbel
and
it
wasnt
really
a
good
or
even
average
beer
either
poured
a
nice
darker
brown
color
with
a
huge
head
of
offwhite
sea
foam
smelled
of
cloves
berries
and
definitely
hops
taste
was
fairly
delicate
to
begin
with
but
finished
strong
with
alcohol
and
hops
i
definitely
wanted
another
bottle
of
this
when
i
was
done
it
was
an
excellent
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
with
some
spicey
undertones
the
yeast
gives
it
a
refreshing
fruit
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
malty
core
that
is
enhanced
with
spices
and
fruity
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
creamy
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
dubbel
i
would
buy
this
again
twelve
oz
brown
little
with
a
simple
silver
label
of
a
monk
pouring
a
beer
the
beer
poured
out
dark
ruby
red
with
a
very
lively
carbonation
that
reminded
me
of
cola
a
two
inch
thick
offwhite
head
formed
rapidly
and
then
receded
to
a
quarter
inch
line
of
foam
there
were
lots
of
yeast
floaters
around
the
aroma
was
sweetsour
reminiscent
of
honey
and
caramel
with
faint
and
distant
hops
tastes
like
it
smelled
sweet
yeasty
and
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
plums
and
toffee
slick
with
a
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
carefully
poured
even
an
aged
bottle
delivers
a
clear
deepcopper
bordering
on
russetbrown
colored
body
with
a
fairsized
head
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
and
although
it
doesnt
hold
particularly
well
it
does
drop
slowly
and
leaves
some
very
nice
spotty
lace
throughout
the
goblet
the
aroma
offers
juicy
dark
fruit
amidst
a
candyish
sweetness
backed
by
a
delicate
caramelish
malt
and
subtle
spiciness
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
some
additional
candyish
sugariness
and
more
spice
and
the
malt
reveals
a
gently
toasted
character
in
addition
to
its
caramelized
sugars
its
very
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
nicely
cloaked
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
lightly
tingly
creamy
mouthfeel
and
it
finishes
with
a
gently
lingering
sweet
maltiness
that
fades
to
reveal
some
spice
and
bitterness
leaving
the
palate
refreshed
and
ready
for
another
sip
an
enjoyable
and
satiating
beer
sterkens
dubbel
ale
kind
of
a
curious
taste
i
guess
i
was
anticipating
more
of
a
yeasty
tartness
to
this
beer
but
it
has
really
got
a
lot
of
candy
like
sweetness
the
color
is
a
deep
amber
with
a
very
white
head
for
the
style
and
nice
belgian
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
candy
like
although
not
cloying
as
already
noted
the
taste
is
driven
by
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
perhaps
a
wee
bit
too
much
rock
sugar
it
is
lacking
that
blazing
alcohol
warmth
that
so
many
of
its
cousins
in
the
style
have
all
in
all
it
is
probably
a
poor
example
of
the
style
but
i
like
it
damn
me
to
¬ìbeer

i
like

toasted

aroma
melded
with
a
nutty
almost
metallic
nose
not
much
to
speak
of
in
the
hop
department
but
i
didnt
expect
much
there
very
sweet
malty
texture
with
a
minimal
copper
penny
in
the
mouth
acidic
twang
to
it
i
suppose
id
say
it
was
drinkable
for
its
light
feel
but
its
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
to
go
the
long
haul
the
beer
pours
deep
amber
to
brown
color
hazy
and
the
head
modest
in
size
frothy
texture
and
a
light
beige
color
the
lace
forms

a

caramel
actually

comes
to

not

thanks
to
garymuchow

a

in

that
sweetness
becomes
defined
as
a
candylike
taste
mixed
in
with
some
fruitiness
noncitrus
more
like
dates
and
maybe
a
little
plum
herbal

also
present
in

and
are

something
is
a

off
in

finish
a
slight
chalkiness
left
on
the
tongue
feels
good
drinking
but
declines
with
the
swallow
disappointing
in
the
end
this
beer
makes
my
glass
look
like
a
pretty
glowing
orb
firey
amber
colored
the
head
isnt
too
impressive
very
thin
and
spotty
smells
of
cherries
and
spice
tastes
nice
but
weak
theres
not
too
much
going
on
here
a
little
bland
on
the
tongue
tasty
enough
to
enjoy
this
one
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
cardboard
flavor
with
a
hint
of
fruit
light
body
for
a
dubbel
with
a
dark
brown
color
nothing
exceptional
for
a
belgian
dubbel
the
foam
was
not
there
possibly
and
old
case
but
the
taste
was
very
drab
and
not
exciting
as
far
as
belgians
go
not
up
to
their
standard
sweet
malt
nose
with
a
slight
soapy
smell
cherry
colored
with
a
slight
white
head
malt
flavor
seems
a
little
watery
with
a
predominant
paper
like
sterile
flavor
you
also
get
traces
of
raison
edgy
yeast
and
a
dry
kicked
up
abv
finish
on
the
tongue
the
beer
also
seems
light
on
the
mouth
side
as
well
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
that
really
impressed
my
tastebuds
that
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
is
pretty
sweet
overall
with
a
big
malty
character
the
fruits
are
very
subtle
at
first
but
they
come
in
later
and
you
are
left
with
an
aftertaste
of
dry
black
cherries
i
picked
up
some
bready
flavors
near
the
end
along
with
a
touch
of
yeast
this
is
definitely
not
an
amazing
beer
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
nut
brown
in
color
with
amberreddish
hues
the
head
was
big
rich
thick
and
creamy
and
tan
in
color
it
lasted
very
well
and
left
a
chunky
lace
behind
that
stretched
all
the
way
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
i
also
noticed
that
this
beer
seemed
to
have
good
carbonation
as
the
bubbles
could
be
seen
through
the
clear
liquid
the
aromas
that
came
from
this
beer
were
of
caramel
malts
fruits
hops
flowers
fresh
grass
some
spices
and
a
slice
of
bread
all
these
seemed
to
come
out
after
each
sip
some
more
pronounced
then
others
and
some
not
until
the
end
the
tastes
were
of
hops
caramel
dried
flowers
sweet
malt
fruit
fresh
and
sour
and
a
yeasty
bread
flavor
which
was
slight
the
beer
had
a
bite
and
was
tangy
in
the
front
some
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
ended
with
a
slight
dry
felling
of
the
hops
all
flavors
seemed
pretty
well
balanced
all
through
the
glass
delicious
and
tasty
but
very
soft
on
the
palate
nothing
too
much
but
nothing
too
little
a
pretty
decent
dubbel
this
beer
pours
a
clear
redbrown
with
a
rockybubbly
off

head
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
very
average
the
smell
is
caramellike
and
somewhate
grassy
the
taste
is
cookielike
with
mild
herbalgrassy
hoppiness
and
a
slight
warming
alcohol
this
beer
while
not
bad
made
me
wonder
if
this
was
a
belgian
version

if
so
can
we
trade
it
for

a

dubbel
and
a
nice
one

a

very
thin

mostly
grassy
with
just
a
scent
of

prominent
bitter

it

an

the

watery
i
guess
it
really
did
not
live
up
to
my
expectations
this
beer
is
like
free
jazz
a
medeski
martin
wood
tune
youre
taken
aback
by
what
seems
to
be
a
cloddish
attempt
at
art
but
you
hang
in
there
because
there
is
something
about
it
something
right
initially
the
nose
seemed
a
pronounced
armpitlike
odor
that
was
not
good
but
as
you
drink
and
the
aromas
seperate
you
notice
the
earthiness
of
it
the
connection
to
something
foreign
the
way
the
spicy
hops
edge
a
transient
sweetness
the
heady
phenolic
and
alcohol
skin
unique
and
good
hazy
dark
amber
in
color
almost
no
head
at
all
lots
of
sediment
in
bottle
even
when
poured
slowly
malty
toffee
like
aroma
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
tartness
spice
and
malt
blend
very
well
together
and
a
hint
of
hops
gives
this
a
slightly
dry
but
very
well
balanced
finish
with
a
gingerbread
cookielike
aftertaste
mediumlight
body
very
drinkable
brilliant
brown
liquid
and
honeycombpatterned
white
head
neutral
nose
of
autumn
leaves
and
oreos
some
gaps
appear
in
the
aromas
and
flavors
revealing
chaff
metal
and
simple
sugar
flavors
otherwise
there
are
nice
spicy
gingerbread
and
tangy
floral
nuances
definitely
a
downable
dubbel
and
not
too
intense
in
a
crossover
kind
of
way
still
quality
is
universally
appreciated
so
why
not
choose
another
initially
a
sweet
malt
aroma
followed
by
more
malt
richness
finally
settling
into
a
phenol
quality
with
sweetness
and
some
cloves
nice
full
head
in
biege
color
that
settled
to
a
rocky
look
with
lacing
trails
nice
amber
color
and
clear
taste
has
nice
blend
of
mild
malt
richness
with
phenols
this
combines
quite
nicely
some
warmth
and
alcohol
taste
but
exceedingly
strong
some
dryness
but
not
bitter
on
the
finish
and
rather
short
maybe
a
little
thin
on
mouthfeel
quite
tastey
and
enjoyable
deep
red
color
with
an
initially
good
head
that
drops
to
lace
very
quickly
a
little
compost
to
the
smell
earthy
and
woody
pleasant
flavor
heavily
malty
with
some
sense
of
caramel
mediumbodied
hops
are
peppery
at
the
close
mostly
there
as
a
balancer
the
smell
promised
more
than
i
tasted
here
a
little
unidimensional
and
could
have
used
a
vague
atringency
and
dried
leaf
flavor
found
in
some
doubles
still
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
cooler
months
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
really
thin
shortlived
head
that
leaves
hardly
any
lace
the
nose
is
of
roasted
malt
with
somewhat
of
a
nutty
characteristic
the
taste
is
of
the
malt
with
almost
no
hop
flavor
penetrating
through
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
and
weak
for
the
style
drinkability
wasnt
poor
but
i
wasnt
in
a
hurry
to
grab
another
one
this
is
one
of
the
few
belgian
beers
with
which
ive
been
disappointed
although
its
certainly
not
bad
its
overpriced
and
rather
average
for
its
style
certainly
a
wellbalanced
ale
slightly
damp
aroma
nice

of

leavesmouthfeel
was
a
little
light
for

taste
but
offered

drinkability

at
one
of
the
local

so
i
will
have
to
try
it
again

mild

a

rich

with

of
the
better

the

detrimental
to

overall
score
the
flavor
isnt
bad
just
weak
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
darks
but
this
was
certainly
worth
a
try
and
its
in
a
cool
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
reddish
hue
the
scent
had
belgian
sugar
peat
and
slight
roast
the
taste
was
most
belgian
leaning
with
touches
of
toffee
and
earth
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
not
much
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
worth
a
try
for
those
that
enjoy
dark
belgians
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
the
flavors
develop
nicely
as
it
warms
up
o
great
beer
full
bodied

flavorful

not
overwhelming
i
could
drink
one

several

that
is

all

we
are
pretty

clearly
a

for
the

happy
as
well
to
see
this

us

my
oh
my
what
a

dark
belgian
ale
i
poured
this
into

noticed
the
large
frothy
head

dark

nutty
flavor
very
refreshing
i
need
to
try
the
other

did
not

mixed

the

creamy
almost
chewey
with

than
other

i
have
had
i
did
not
pick
up
on
bubble
gum
notes
as
i
have
in
other
dubbels
which
was
nice
it
was
a
good
dubbel
but
dubels
are
not
my
thing
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
very
interesting
to
taste
and
given
the
purity
law
pretty
amazing
in
the
quality
and
complexity
involved
there
may
not
be
much
variety
in
the
taste
but
this
is
one
of
the
most
friendly
dark
beers
youll
find
goes
extremely
well
with
food
comforting
nutty
flavor
pleasant
smell
great
mouthfeel
and
pleasant
appearance
well
worth
the
world
class
rating
it
gets
from
the
bros
if
you
drink
this
while
not
eating
ymmv
doa
mouthfeel
as
pretty
light
considering
the
style
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
it
has
a
very
light
character
i
would
drink
it
again
and
would
recommend
it
it
would
go
well
with
a
number
of
dishes
such
as
a
lightly
seasoned
steak
or
a
light
dessert
desert
st
sebastiaan
is
very
approachable
as
a
good
relaxing
beer
it
would
also
work
well
with
mild
foods
o
just
the
perfect
beer
it
was
a
christmas
present
from
last
year
and
after
sitting
there
for
so
long
i
thought
i
should
probably
drink
this
im
so
very
glad
i
finally
did
this
is
by
far
one
of
if
not
the
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
st
sebastiaan
is
on
the
thin
side
which
really
doesnt
let
the
flavors
stick
to
the
tongue
like
i
would
hope
but
it
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
the
slight
tartness
definitely
holds
the
sweet
malts
in
check
overall
not
too
bad
but
ive
definitely
had
better
belgian
dubbels
its
very
high
in
alcohol
theres
a
maltyness
that
pervades
throughout
and
a
dark
fruit
taste
of
grape
thick
and
very
heavy
yet
smooth
in
short
doses
interesting
m
low
to
medium
carbonation
provides
barly
enough
balance
for
the
medium
attenuated
beer
pretty
drinkable
o
very
good
dubbel
that
i
highly
recommend
o
good
dubbels
not
worth
the
12
bucks
drinkability
is
certaintly
high
a
bottle
that
have
been
abused
a
bit
but
this
beer
has
a
thin
metallic
body
to
it
that
is
not
the
pleasing
and
more
fusels
than
this
reviewer
like
in
belgian
dubble
thankfully
big
ass
porcelain
bottle
was
gift
becoming
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
up
but
not
enough
for
me
to
change
my
numbers
definitely
not
the
first
dubble
i
would
reach
for
but
definitely
not
the
last
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
because
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
as
good
as
the

might
suggest

flavors
make

this
beer
is
more
about
the
yeast
the
body
is
light
perhaps
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
not
a
bad
beer
overall
nor
a
great
one

threw
my
back
out

the

its
hard
to
keep
picking
it
up
unless
of

i
need
more
bottles
for

notes
overall
very
average
not
very
complex

personally
not

enough
for
me

very
foamy
in

up
the
whole
experience
the
caramel
butterscotch
brown
sugar
notes
are
obvious
but
hardly
sweet
in
an
enduring
fashion
in
fact
its
a
fairly
dry
beer
orange

mostly
quiet
classy
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
more
depth
of
flavor
couldnt
hurt
though
d
really
nice
drinkable
beer
nice
depth
of
character
fills
me
with
desire
for
another
one
complex
a
really
great
beer
that
very
accurately
depicts
the
style
a
solid
belgian
ale
but
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
for
a
beer
its
strength
i
found
this
highly
delectible
really
enjoyed
the
subtle
complexities
d
a
great
example
of
how
unique
this
style
can
be
definitely
one
i
will
be
revisiting
in
the
near
future
this
stuff
is
dece
on
a
rainy
night
while
my
little
one
sleeps
gently
in
his
crib
i
search
frantically
through
the
entanglement
of
kitchen
wares
i
call
a
top
drawer
and
after
many
guffaws
and
sighs
i
finally
procure
my
bottle
opener
sit
down
on
the
terrace
and
crack
open
one
of
the
finest
brews
i
have
ever
had
life
is
glorious
d
an
excellent
belgian
dark
ale
with
6
9
alcohol
you
could
enjoy
a
few
and
still
remain
cognizant
s
not
very
hoppy
smells
mostly
like
malt
a
little
sweet
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
with
mineral
notes
found
in
some
of
the
better
belgian
beers
this
is
a
good
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
dark
beers
and
i
will
purchase
more
in
the
future
very
enjoyable
sipper
this
beer
does
not
rank
up
there
with
the
trappist
versions
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
but
still
is
very
nice
d
this
was
on
sale
and
i
couldnt
pass
up
the
super
cool
stone
bottle
im
very
glad
i
grabbed
this
perhaps
too
pricey
to
buy
more
than
once
a
year
but
well
worth
the
investment
oil
feel
to
it
slick
caramel
aftertaste
little
punch
or
bite
to
it
seems
very
flat
too
a
dark
beer
that
has
a
slightly
sweet
flavor
to
it
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
prunes
in
the
nose
no
hop
flavor
at
all
and
not
much
of
a
flavor
overall
really
absolutely
no
carbonation
at
all
when
poured
looked
like
brown
water
not
a
good
beer
flat
but
would
like
to
try
again
if
carbonated
properly
if
that
is
how
it
is
supposed
to
be
as
is
would
not
reccomend
especially
at
around
9
a
bottle
a
dark
and
syrupy
beer
slightly
sweet
not
particularly
hoppy
or
flavorful
zero
carbonation
upon
pouring
into
the
goblet
as
in
no
bubbles
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
common
problem
but
if
it
is
id
be
hesitant
to
try
it
again
its
not
good
flat
but
i
see
that
it
could
potentially
be
good
with
the
proper
carbonation
i
might
try
it
again
and
update
my
review
i
poured
a
16
ounce
bottle
into
a
tupip
glass
this
pours
a
beutiful
dark
color
with
hints
of
red
a
big
fluffy
head
forms
then
fades
quickly
leaving
little
streaks
of
lace
when
i
held
it
up
to
a
light
there
are
lettle
yeasty
floaters
the
nose
is
of
a
sweet
brown
sugary
alchohol
the
first
sip
is
sweet
and
the
finish
is
of
a
lingering
complew
alchohol
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
the
beer
is
an
enjoyable
sipper
a
damn
fine
beer
d
not
to
bad
but
i
wouldnt
bother
picking
up
another
bottle
unless
i
was
sure
it
was
actually
carbonated
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
theres
also
a
musty
cave
flavor
that
is
hard
to
describe
very
pleasing
a
solid
beer
if
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
an
enjoyable
dubbel
but
not
quite
as
exciting
as
i
was
hoping
for
still
i
recall
the
price
being
pretty
good
and
would
recommend
it
for
fans
of
belgian
beers
bottom
line
buy
a
few
a
nice
belgium
dubble
one
i
would
drink
again
and
recommend
this
style
is
always
hit
or
miss
with
me
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
probably
my
favorite
to
date
if
i
remember
correctly
this
can
be
had
for
a
very
decent
price
too
especially
considering
the
cool
ceramic
swingtop
bottle
it
comes
in
although
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
was
not
completely
dissatisfied
it
is
getting
better
as
it
warms
and
requires
sipping
at
slower
intervals
enjoy
slowly
and
limit
your
intake
drinkability
this
is
good
stuff
i
was
surprised
by
the
roasted
malt
flavors
i
was
detecting
if
i
had
to
recommend
a
dubbel
id
recommend
it
to
a
friend
i
recieved
this
beer
from
cape
fear
wine
and
beer
i
was
drawn
to
the
dark
ceramic
bottle
with
the
picture
of
the
monk
on
the
front
my
barkeep
popped
it
and
poured
into
tulip
glass
for
me
as
i
prepared
to
drink
i
was
taken
aback
by
the
amazing
head
that
erupted
from
the
glass
the
next
aspect
of
the
beer
i
took
notice
to
was
the
beautiful
raven
color
of
my
glass
the
lacing
of
this
beer
was
as
if
someone
had
draped
a
doilie
across
my
glass
in
the
pour
now
to
the
smell
a
massive
roasted
malt
caramel
breath
drew
my
face
into
the
glass
to
embibe
the
color
of
this
beer
being
somewhat
deceptive
it
is
amazingly
drinkable
i
am
tempted
to
chug
but
restrain
myself
and
sip
this
nectar
away
drinks
easy
a
nice
clean
tasting
unassuming
dubbel
d
a
disappointment
looks
like
more
money
went
into
the
presentation
ceramic
bottle
than
the
beer
too
bad
500
cl
ceramic
bottle
dark
brown
colour
aond
no
head
at
all
at
first
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
bad
from
travel
but
no
delicious
aroma
of
pears
peaches
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
how
can
this
be
made
according
to
the
german
purity
law
sweet
silky
flavor
but
a
lighter
body
than
expected
taste
of
fruits
again
peaches
port
wine
spices
and
chocolate
its
great
the
only
weakness
is
the
shy
body
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thick
persistent
head
it
exhibited
excellent
lacing
when
i
swirled
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
sour
with
some
malt
undertones
the
taste
is
quite
malty
with
some
hints
of
sourness
and
perhaps
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
shy
of
chewy
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
brew
that
works
well
tasted
nice
if
a
bit
bland
for
a
dubbel
rich
and
malty
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
but
nothing
like
other
dubbels
ive
had
a
bit
of
a
shame
too
nice
packaging
maybe
the
german
influence
is
to
blame
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
to
step
out
of
the
norm
this
is
a
good
way
to
get
a
newkie
brown
drinker
to
try
new
things
poured
a
dark
brown
brick
color
with
a
tan
creamy
head
that
left
a
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
earthy
some
spice
tinge
of
dark
fruit
bit
of
metallic
aroma
the
taste
is
fairly
complex
with
a
lively
carbonation
chewy
sweet
caramel
maltiness
at
first
then
some
dark
fruit
tinge
of
steely
crystal
malt
some
earthy
spice
and
maybe
a
small
bit
of
bitter
hops
to
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
and
creamy
from
the
carbonation
definatly
a
drinkable
dubbel
imo
this
one
is
on
the
earthier
side
belgian
dubbel
recommended
the
taste
of
toasty
toffee
with
a
caramel
nose
with
layers
of
soft
malts
and
hops
a
big
beer
without
being
overly
heavy
extremely
wellbalanced
again
i
hope
i
got
a
bad
bottle
luckily
the
taste
is
good
enough
to
warrant
drinking
the
whole
thing
this
brew
has
a
very
slick
and
wet
presence
on
the
palate
almost
zero
carbonation
very
subdued
taste
notes
with
toasty
nutty
nuances
all
i
can
say
is
wtf
i
was
expecting
more
i
think
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
one
but
for
the
price
i
paid
i
dont
think
this
one
will
be
getting
a
second
shot
others
are
reporting
foamy
heads
and
i
got
nothing
this
beer
is
so
faint
i
think
that
it
would
be
best
saved
to
be
paired
with
a
meal
so
that
the
flavors
of
the
meal
could
take
prominence
over
this
brew¬ís
mild
and
timid
nature
ruby
colored
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
dried
fruit
and
malt
sweetness
as
well
as
alcohol
in
the
aroma
flavor
profile
included
dried
cherries
and
prunes
malt
and
too
little
spice
to
provide
any
oomph
to
the
melange
of
sweet
malt
and
fruit
decent
but
not
something
i¬íd
look
for
again
large
glass
bottle
differant
then
whats
shown
above
caged
and
corked
opened
with
a
lot
of
energy
the
cork
went
flying
pours
the
typical
dubbel
dark
brown
clear
with
a
noisy
tan
head
with
medium
sized
bubbles
and
moderate
retention
lacing
was
blotchy
but
generally
unimpressive
nose
of
vanilla
cola
toffee
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
dubbel
perhaps
its
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
spectrum
for
the
style
more
cola
caramel
and
sweet
candi
sugars
smooth
finish
adds
up
to
a
tasty
and
drinkable
sipper
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
i
like
how
the
flavor
profile
has
changed
as
it
warms
and
it
is
turning
out
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
there
may
be
a
hint
of
oxidation
here
but
it
only
adds
complexity
as
the
flavors
come
out
of
the
warmer
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
presentation
packaged
in
a
sixteenounce
earthenware
crock
served
in
a
belgian
chalice
drinkability
unlike
some
of
the
more
famous
dubbels
this
is
not
as
complex
nor
is
it
as
sweet
nevertheless
it
has
its
merits
and
is
worth
seeking
out
blah
drinkability
probably
need
to
find
another
bottle
but
at
11
each
i
wont
be
giving
this
one
a
retry
anytime
soon
a
classsic
belgian
beer
with
an
accent
of
alcohol
recommended
like
a
appetizer
and
with
snacks
no
more
serving
in
a
pilsner
glass
high
in
carbonation
high
in
hops
and
malt
taste
and
aroma
appearance
is
deep
brown
good
for
me
smell
like
a
extreme
beer
mouthfeel
is

drinkability
awful
not
recommended
750
ml
bottle
cork
caged
and
primed
to
explode
on
opening
dark
maroon
color
little
bits
of
carbonation
clear
body
head
is
very
ragged
from
the
beginnning
it
came
up
a
lot
on
the
pour
due
to
the
explosivity
lots
of
diacetyl
in
the
nose
dark
fruits
and
carmel
taste
is
dark
yet
sharp
and
well
hopped
the
belgian
funk
is
noticeable
and
welcomed
acidity
is
pretty
high
this
may
be
an
old
sample
but
the
bottle
has
an
unitelligable
batch
code
on
it
pretty
good
although
a
fresh
sample
might
be
better
i
like
the
ceramic
bottle
i
guess
that
i¬ím
a
sucker
for
interesting
packaging
this
beer
is
an
earthy
brown
color
fairly
clear
and
has
a
soapy
white
head
fisheye
bubbles
and
moderate
lace
are
notable
in
the
foam
the
smell
is
sort
of
subdued
for
a
belgian
dubbel
with
just
a
bit
of
yeast
sugar
and
malt
present
it¬ís
alright
but
i
would
have
appreciated
a
more
pronounced
and
complex
aroma
the
taste
makes
up
a
little
ground¬Öpeppery
a
bit
of
alcohol
malt
in
the
front
yeast
and
brown
sugar
fairly
light
bodied
for
a
dubbel
but
it¬ís
very
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
it¬ís
not
worth
the
price
however
to
have
another
one
beautiful
very
dark
brown
smell
of
toffee
and
roast
and
alcohol
a
hint
of
sourness
and
dryness
and
sweetness
yet
none
of
the
above
complex
in
every
sip
yet
simple
and
very
drinkable
very
much
liked
a
surprise
at
volo
cafe
outstanding

that
my
drinking
buddy
kept
for
his
wife
this
beer
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
burgundy
tint
thick
beige
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
and
nutty
but
has
some
characteristics
of
a
flemish
sour
too
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
flavors
of
burnt
malt
raisin
sour
fruit
and
yeast
the
finish
is
on
the
thin
side
and
is
rather
fruity
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
belgian
at
times
it
is
well
balanced
and
at
others
it
is
not
but
more
often
than
not
it
is
pretty
good

for
a
16oz
bottle
from
hoosick
street
discount
bev
troy
ny
first
i
noticed
in
the
smell
that
it
would
be
sweet
some
hops
were
there
but
overal
malty
tasting
it
afterwards
it
was
malty
sweet
the
more
i
drank
the
sweeter
it
got
and
after
a
promissing
start
at
the
end
it
turned
out
to
be
quiet
disappointing
for
a
belgium
dubbel
caramel
colour
with
a
fizzy
head
malty
with
a
ton
of
fruity
flavours
ranging
from
banana
to
apple
fantastic
this
is
a
brew
that
balances
and
improves
throughout
overall
decent
from
a
flavor
and
looks
perspective
but
in
the
end
it
left
me
wanting
more
and
with
so
many
wonderful
belgians
out
there
i
doubt
ill
be
visiting
this
particular
brew
again
the
beer
departs

a
burgundy
color
that
is
somewhat
hazy
with
a
portly
head
creamy
in
texture
and
a
nice
light
tan
color
with
the
lace
forming
a
velum
like
curtain
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is
malt
dominated
but
has
pleasant
over
ripe
fruit
aromas
quite
nice
the
start
is
sweet
with
a
decent
malt
presence
and
the
mouth
feel
moderate

is
minimally
carbonated

like
pertinently
hopped

dry
somewhat
tart

nice

feel
is

gets
a
bit
of
a
pick
up
toward
the
middle
and
into
the
finish
its
not
watery
more
or
less
just
thin
or
perhaps
weakended
it
lacks
some
depth
and
thickness
thats
usually
attributed
to
a
good
dubble
finishes
dry
but
works
at
it
in
a
tenuous
manner
this
was
pretty
average
notes
the
bottle
is
very
interesting
i
was
excited
to
drink
this
based
on
the
bottle
alone
i
was
not
let
down
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
this
brew
is
a
murky

color
with
a
excellent

the
scent
is
malty
with
some
fruits

a
little
alcohol
spice
the
taste
has
a
nice
chewy
malt
backbone
with
hops
and
dark
fruits
intermingling
nice
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
the
beer
pours

color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
boasts
of
pale
and
roasted
malts
which
give
it
a
nice
brown
toasted
scent
the
taste
is
good
its
smooth
with
a
dry
roasted
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
it
says
dark
but
it
fits
more
of
a
brown
style
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
this
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine

smell
musty

i
say
i
iike
it
the

is
again
a
musty

providing
the
background
to
a
light
sweet
raison
yeast
faint
hops
and
a
barely
noticeable
alcohol
it
is
light

it

and
a

bite
a

feeling
as

down
tastes
pretty
good
especially
on
the

unique
is
the
word
i
would
use
to
describes
its
flavor
fruity
and
well
hopped
lots
of
cherries
raisins
dates
some
clove
on
the
midpalate
with
a
well
balanced
smooth
character
tastes
great
hard
to
believe
it
is

to
the
fact
it

this

visually
unfortunately
the
bubbly
offwhite

didn¬ít

it
faded
quickly
from
the
zenith
of
a
finger
disorganized
head
remnants
tried
to
cap
the
beer
it
did
not
sparse
lacing
the
nose
was
pleasant
and
typical
of
a
belgium
dubbel
soft
toasty
malts
with
good
amounts
of
bread
yeast
too
the
fruitiness
is
secondary
apples
and
raisins
distant
earthyspiciness
i
prefer
more
potency
but
it
was
still
inviting
i
found
the
palate
to
be
exceedingly
dry
which
i
really
enjoyed
this
is
not
the
most
challenging
dubbel
i¬íve
run
across
by
know
means
is
this
simple
tasting
stark
crystal
malts
upfront
cleaner
than
need
be
in
the
middle
there
is
a
mildly
toothy
alcohol
bite
mixed
with
a
subtle
hops
spiciness
followed
quickly
by
a
note
of
fruitiness
the
finish
is
lightly
peppery
malty
but
clean
and
slick
the
carbonation
is
almost
completely
absent
which
is
nice
medium
body
respectable
mouthfeel
i
think
this
is
too
easy
to
drink
i
want
to
have
to
sip
my
¬ìgood
beers
¬î
i
forked
out
9
00
for
a
16ounce
ceramic
jug
here
in
omaha
it
is
far
too
costly
to
drink
again
especially
considering
it
was
not
that
outstanding¬Ö
a
solid
offering
this
poured
a
nice
deep
dark
color
with
a
nice
sized
head
that
left
nice
sized
lacing
the
smell
was
of
a
sweetness
almost
similar
to
a
berry
drink
flavor
lacked
complexity
that
a
belgian
should
have
too
sweet
and
not
enough
hops
or
spice
finishes
a
little
wetter
than
most
belgians
which
isnt
always
bad
decent
tasting
but
not
much
more
and
not
worth
the
7
99
for
16
oz
drinkability
¬ñ
this
went
down
fairly
well
the
aftertaste
though
was
a
little
dry
so
i¬ím
thinking
maybe
more
hops
than
needed
for
the
style
overall
a
good
ale
but
at
7
99
for
a
16
oz
bottle
its
a
stretch
i
found
this
in
a
neighborhood
moscow
grocery
store
it
came
in
a
lovely
grayishred
ceramic
16
ounce
bottle
with
both
a
bottle
cap
and
a
resealable
fliptop
it
poured
a
wonderful
clear
orangebrown
color
under
a
tannishbeige
head
that
was
both
firm
and
long
lasting
mine
gave
beautiful
lace
rings
all
the
way
down
the
nose
was
big
and
malty
announced
its
presence
with
authority
the
mouth
was
a
touch
on
the
heavy
side
and
not
too
tingly
although
a
bit
more
than
i
expected
the
initial
taste
is
very
complex
caramel
citrus
grains
the
finish
is
a
tad
too
sour
with
the
lurking
presence
of
alcohol
somewhere
deep
down
inside
buried
even
more
deeply
were
the
hops
they
are
there
but
you
sure
have
to
look
for
them
hops
do
come
out
in
the
sweetishsour
aftertaste
leaving
a
mishmash
that
i
did
not
actually
find
all
that
appealling
this
brew
was
a
tad
too
sour
not
bitter
enough
for
my
taste
still
definitely
a
quality
brew
nice
malty
full
flavored
aroma
a
welcome
break
from
the
poor
quality
bees
i
have
rated
recently
it
poured
a
huge
head
of
light
brown
small
bubbles
when
it
receded
it
left
little
or
no
lacing
it
has
a
cloudy
dark
brown
body
its
flavor
is
different
it
was
smooth
and
no
after
bite
or
remarkable
fore
taste
all
in
all
it
was
a
good
brew
to
watch
the
war

on
the

is

this
is
about
as
exciting
as
watching

the
aroma
is
fruity
with
some
medicinal
characteristics
the
flavor
is
sweet
at
the
beginning
it
then
flows
to
a
fruity
medicinal
flavor
this
beer
finishes
off
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
a
bit
astringent
too
it
is
mediumfull
in
body
not
to
bad
on
the
ease
of
drinking
this
one
was
better
than
i
expected
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
a

like
finish
makes
this
bubbly
brew
quite
memorable
if
you
like
your

more
earthy
and
less
sweet
give
this
one
a
try
cherry

flavor
starts
off
smooth

caught

then
some

very

this
beer
poured
a
very
dark

color
and
formed
a
nice
very
light

bubbly
head
that
subsided
quickly
and
left
some

the
aroma
was
of
malt

fruit
very
sweet
the
flavor
was
of
malt
fruit
and
some
spice
the

was
a
medium

the
finish
had
elements
of
both
the
fruit

the

the

was
detectable
but
not
distracting
notes
relatively
sweet

with
odd
complexities
that
are
well
drawn

embrace

o
ive
had
this
beer
lots
of
times
but
its
just
the
second
dubbel
ive
had
the
other
one
was
maredsous
8
and
that
one
was
pretty
neat
as
well
i
really
like
trappist
beers
and
this
one
is
a
good
start
into
this
kind
of
beer
overall
this
is
very
decent
stuff
i
tend
to
be
quite
a
fan
of
dubbels
in
any
case
but
im
happy
to
say
that
the
la
trappes
dubbel
is
the
best
of
their
standard
range
ive
yet
had
with
the
quad
to
come
nice
stuff
certainly
a
nice
beer
a
straightforward
dubbel
it
is
nicely
drinkable
and
offers
a
pretty
nice
interpretation
of
this
malty
belgian
style
it
doesnt
have
many
noticeable
flaws
but
i
didnt
find
much
terribly
exciting
either
just
a
really
wellconstructed
malty
and
dry
ale
that
has
nice
balance
there
are
trappist
beers
that
are
a
lot
more
interesting
but
this
is
quality

at

though
a

but
by
no
means
is
this
a
world
beater
just
a
quality
beer
that
i
would
welcome
again
anytime
o
ive
had
the
quad
and
the
tripel
before
this
dubbel
the
quad
is
world
class
the
tripel
is
not
very
good
and
this
dubbel
is
every
bit
as
good
as
the
quad
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
its
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
more
than
just
one
overall
very
drinkable
but
bland
for
the
style
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
o
fantastic
really
well
rounded
perfectly
balanced
and
expertly
crafted
its
rare
to
taste
something
so
good
almost
great
but
lack
of
some
crisp
however
its
leverage
by
nicely
balance
aroma
and
flavor
also

aroma
of

taste
is
bitter
at

like
a
bitter
chocolate
at
the
end
bittersweet
a
bit
of
caramel
there
thick
in
body
and
average
carbonation
overall
a
really
great
beer
in

a

into
a

with
a
smallish

smells
like

and
belgian

flavor
is
not

as

not

its

nice

with

overall
a

and
very
drinkable
at

abv
but
its
quality
and
excitement
lag
well
behind
the
la
trappe
quad
notes
maybe
the
fruity
and
soft
sour
touch
shines
more
than
what
is
typically
expected
of
a
trappist
dubbel
but
this
is
a
pretty
pleasing
and
quality
brew
within
this
bracket
given
the
rest
of
the
selection
in
most
common
spots
in
spain
it
is
rather
nice
to
have
this
one
waiting
on
the
shelve
not
so
sure
i
would
reach
out
for
it
again
in
the
states
but
a
good
one
to
have
around
and
share
o
i
say
god
bless
the
trappist
monks
and
no
doubt
he
does
there
are
better
out
there
but
this
one
is
good
indeed
well
worth
the
visit
o
3

i
always
want
to
like
dubbels
more
but
i
always
get
left
wanting
something
more
in
this
case
i
think
it
is
a
nice
soft
cheese
o
this
is
a
top
notch
dubbel
right
up
there
with
westmalle
and
ommegang
and
way
beyond
most
others
overall
a
good
dubbel
but
nothing
outstanding
for
me
i
dug
the
carbonation
level
a
solid
dubbel
but
a
bit
cloyingly
sweet
better
widely
available
options
o
a
solid
easy
to
drink
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
o
i
love
trappist
ales
good
dubbel
a
very
interesting
brew
definitely
different
from
other
dubbels
ive
had
and
contains
a
different
yeasty
taste
from
other
trappist
ales
however
it
is
quite
reminiscent
to
rochefort
6
if
that
gives
me
any
idea
what
it
tastes
like
spicy
malty
slightly
boozy
yet
not
too
thick
or
sweet
in
character
definitely
recommended
o
a
dubbel
is
always
a
dubbel
nice
especially
if
brewed
by
trappistmonks
mnice
mouthfeel
not
to
difficult
to
drink
starting
mild
with
some
sweetness
changing
slowly
to
some
medium
bitterness
d
drinks
as
good
as
other
monkly
dubbels
although
flavor
is
lacking
just
a
bit
for
me
even
after
a
couple
years
as
trappist
brews
generally
break
the
4
5
mark
in
my
book
this
one
is
welcome
in
my
chalice
any
time
o
good
beer
m
medium
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
conclusion
this
is
an
outstanding
dubbel
and
one
that
i
consider
a
benchmark
for
the
style
tasty
and
complex
certainly
worth
your
money
and
time
murky
brown
with
a
small
to
near
nonexistent

airy
froth
which
surrounds

swirly
sea
of
small
aimless

aroma
up

with
a
little

dry

and

at
the
end
more
grape
and
grain
to
the
tongue
with
taffy
and
plum
finishing
it
off
noticeably
airy
but
still
satisfying
and
perfectly
balanced
consummately
refined
and
more
straight
forward
than
bold
if
they
served
this
at
communion
instead
of
grape
juice
i
still
might
be
going
to
church
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
very
drinkable
solid
offering
this
dubbel
pours
out
as
a
earthy
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
head
lasts
for
a
little
while
the
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
earth
and
yeast
the
taste
follows
up
with
the
same
qualities
as
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
not
much
carbonation
but
had
a
good
medium
body
to
it
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
dubbels
but
this
one
worth
trying
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
dark
highalcohol
beer
for
people
who
like
that
taste
od
not
a
bad
dubbel
not
too
full
of
those
yeasty
notes
most
likely
because
its
filtered
a
nice
drink
in
a
small
alley
with
people
passing
tasty
and
worth
a
try
overall
a
great
representation
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
dubbels
out
there
from
the
corked
big
bottle
marked
1015k11010
sampled
on
april
12
2011
a
dynamic
looking
ruby
red
when
held
to
the
light
and
do
hold
it
to
the
light
because
out
of
the
light
it
looks
a
bit
brown
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
aromas
of
yeast
smoky
malts
and
dark
fruits
like
plum
the
body
settles
comfortably
on
the
tongue
while
the
head
delicately
tickles
the
lips
the
flavors
abound
with
moderate
malts
with
a
hoppy
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
interesting
and
engaging
burns
a
tad
too
much
but
otherwise
great
balance
between
complexity
and
drinkability
what
makes
this
style
great
o
overall
a
very
nice
dubbel
and
would
try
again
very
drinkable
brew
good
carbonation
and
freshness
i
would
buy
this
definitely
again
d
very
sweet
milkshakesweet
but
nice
all
the
same
it
disappeared
before
i
realised
it
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
the
inviting
aroma
and
the
complexity
to
the
taste
from
the
first
whiff
of
the
beer
you
are
drawn
in
and
want
to
sip
it
right
away
once
you
finally
do
you
are
met
with
a
straightforward
dubbel
with
some
inherent
complexities
through
the
finish
of
the
taste
what
was
most
surprising
about
this
drink
was
how
quenching
and
cooling
it
was
to
sip
the
drinker
is
left
refreshed
and
wanting
more
d
very
drinkable
the
dr
pepper
flavor
takes
a
little
getting
used
to
but
once
i
adjusted
to
the
maltfest
a
good
malty
malty
malty
beer
i
feel
like
i
just
drank
a
vitamin
shake
overall
a
very
solid
dubbel
and
one
that
is
probably
just
a
little
better
on
tap
d
not
much
drinkable
since
the
perfume
and
oil
taste
but
i
can
bet
other
bottles
or
tap
beer
will
be
lot
more
better
d
the
added
sweetness
increased
sweetness
and
the
taste
of
redcurrant
berries
made
this
beer
something
distinct
as
opposed
to
a
lesser
version
of
the
quadrupel
very
refreshing
and
bit
of
a
summer
beer
even
if
it
is
a
serious
beer
altogether
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
chalice
glass
golden
orange
colour
with
a
foamy
white
head
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
spices
fruits
and
alcohol
the
flavour
is
malts
spices
alcohol
and
some
fruitiness
with
a
bitter
finish
mediumbodied
and
smooth
mouthfeel
pretty
decent
dubbel
but
not
the
best
a
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
with
a
drier
finish
good
for
christmas
drinkability
was
low
as
this
beer
was
just
too
sweet
for
me
o
i
like
the
fruity
and
chocolaty
flavors
however
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
very
drinkable
see
westmalle
and
not
complex
enough
to
make
for
a
good
strong
dark
see
maudite
chimay
blue
the
warming
feel
from
the
alcohol
and
spectrum
of
flavors
hurt
drinkability
a
bit
but
overall
a
pleasant
brew
d
a
little
one
dimensional
likme
other
la
trappe
beers
very
nice
worth
a
try
a
really
solid
dubbel
but
for
the
price
there
are
better
to
be
had
achel
bruin
is
far
better
this
is
just
lacking
all
respects
the
bottle
is
similar
to
the
tripel
label
and
not
like
what
the
picture
shows
here
it
also
states
7
0
abv
not
6
5
but
lets
not
get
wrapped
up
in
petty
details
it
pours
a
wonderful
deep
amber
brown
color
with
approx
1
inch
of
head
and
some
mild
lacing
smell
is
wonderful
the
banana
bread
laced
with
rum
jumps
out
of
my
chalice
and
punches
me
lightly
taste
is
sweet
fruity
bready
some
cherry
and
banana
taste
and
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
present
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
almost
like
eating
a
banana
nut
bran
muffin
laced
with
rum
drinkability
is
fine
i
will
hunt
these
down
again
cheers
drinkability
its
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
good
but
not
the
most
complex
or
interesting
d
its
a
fine
beer
good
but
not
great
i
would
drink
it
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
im
not
really
into
dubbels
but
this
one
rather
satisfied
me
it
has
that
typical
la
trappe
sweet
dark
malty
caramel
toffee
taste
i
like
you
can
find
it
in
the
quadrupel
oak
aged
as
well
but
you
have
to
like
it
went
down
really
well
fresh
and
warmed
up
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
had
this
on
tap
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
in
branded
glassware
pours
a
mahogany
brown
with
a
finger
or
two
of
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
smells
of
strong
brown
sugar
and
candied
cherries
i
cannot
overstate
how
sugary
this
smelled
flavour
is
incredibly
sweet
my
friend
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
so
i
basically
had
2
glasses
of
this
in
a
row
i
enjoyeded
it
but
prefer
a
bit
less
of
the
sweetness
overall
not
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
by
a
long
shot
i
would
buy
it
again
if
it
were
at
a
discount
price
but
id
buy
some
nice
cheese
to
go
with
it
of
course
jd
d
great
dubbel
i
dont
find
myself
diggin
dubbels
as
much
as
i
like
this
one
really
a
winner
d
a
very
nice
dubbel
and
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
i
found
it
had
a
very
good
balance
to
it
very
drinkable
at
a
medium
to
slow
pace
has
a
warming
effect
on
the
stomach
which
gets
a
bit
coarse
if
you
drink
it
to
fast
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
it
really
didnt
excite
me
much
would
drink
it
again
though
overall
impression
classic
dubbel
but
not
overly
exciting
watered
down
and
lacking
appropriate
carbonation
its
a
very
nice
belgian
smooth
and
good
flavor
the
flavor
seems
to
drop
off
leaving
very
little
aftertaste
there
is
a
syruplike
coating
felt
after
drinking
definitely
one
of
my
favourite
belgian
poured
into
a
koningshoeven
chalice
a
ruby
black
with
a
one
finger
white
head
no
lacing
and
little
retention
the
scent
is
strong
of
carmeled
raisins
and
grapefruit
the
taste
is
a
malt
bomb
with
more
raisin
flavors
and
a
little
hop
bite
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
give
a
little
bit
of
dryness
overall
this
beer
is
a
succes
will
definately
buy
again
notes
think
i
might
like
this
better
than
the
quad
and
am
going
to
lay
some
down
for
aging
dont
usually
like
dubbels
but
this
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
great
example
of
a
dubbel
which
in
this
case
results
in
a
higher
rating
poured
a
dark
brown
with
onefinger
tan
head
that
leaves
lace
down
glass
on
top
of
a
yeasty
orangeish
smell
with
citric
hop
notes
along
with
some
sugary
sweet
malt
and
there
are
offshoots
of
sour
and
tropical
fruit
like
grape
pear
and
apple
a
little
less
sweet
than
i
like
but
good
carbonation
leads
to
a
crisp
lighttomedium
body
thats
smooth
with
citric
and
grapefruit
fruit
flavors
along
with
a
little
bit
of
sour
and
tropical
splash
balances
with
bready
caramel
malts
plus
hints
of
cocoa
and
roasted
along
with
mild
abv
so
the
beer
is
both
fruit
and
sweet
flavored
and
it
all
has
chance
to
shine
as
i
sip
there
is
a
lil
bit
more
of
sticky
syrupy
sweetness
in
the
malts
and
a
touch
more
dryness
in
the
finish
i
have
to
preface
this
with
the
fact
that
i
dont
particularly
like
belgian
style
beers
but
i
like
this
one
no
head
at
all
on
draft
great
amber
color
not
much
aroma
but
real
great
taste
what
aroma
there
is
is
sweet
and
spicey
taste
is
great
not
too
sweet
perfect
i
will
seel
this
one
out
again
for
sure
the
monks
know
what
they
are
doing
d
this
is
a
great
balanced
and
complex
malt
forward
beer
that
has
everything
in
balance
there
are
some
oxidative
notes
that
get
in
the
way
a
bit
but
still
this
very
drinkable
poured
an
11
2
ounce
bottle
into
a
chimay
chalice
great
reddish
brown
color
nice
head
but
it
disappears
within
a
few
seconds
lacing
is
nonexistent
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
trappist
ales
good
but
not
great
plenty
of
sweetness
and
caramel
the
dubbel
style
is
not
among
my
favorites
when
it
comes
to
belgian
ales
but
this
beer
is
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
maybe
its
the
cola
and
ice
tea
that
balances
the
sweetness
so
well
but
whatever
this
is
just
a
very
fine
beer
pours
a
strong
tea
colored
brown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
smells
malty
spicy
and
it
has
a
little
undercurrent
of
alcohol
initial
taste
is
of
i
guess
i
would
call
it
fruit
not
the
dark
pruneraisin
of
a
porter
but
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
lighter
fruit
i
cant
think
of
a
fruit
that
would
describe
this
but
ill
simply
call
it
light
finish
fruit
aftertaste
is
a
very
solid
burned
sugarcaramel
flavor
taste
and
beer
lingers
for
a
short
bit
though
not
so
long
as
to
detract
from
the
experience
m
d
nice
fluffy
feel
and
great
drinkability
with
the
relative
lower
abv
body
is
surprisingly
light
for
the
flavours
the
carbonation
is
unsuitably
high
after
chimay
red
this
is
probably
my
favourite
double
actually
a
type
of
beer
i
havent
been
overly
fond
of
in
the
past
but
with
this
and
the
chimay
im
starting
to
love
this
style
slightly
soured
cherry
taste
less
sweet
on
the
tongue
rich
sugary
body
good
carbonation
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
one
can
tell
it
is
well
made
complex
fruity
esters
are
felt
on
the
nose
this
course
provides
a
mishmash
of
different
flavors
of
fruit
where
there
cue
mostly
red
and
black
fruits
the
palate
is
quite
heady
with
a
body
busy
in
toasted
malt
that
is
quickly
boosted
by
a
good
spicy
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
body
is
initially
soft
almost
like
water
but
it
becomes
more
complex
very
quickly
very
similar
to
the
st
bernardus
prior
but
perhaps
more
focused
on
the
maltyfruity
red
fruit
typically
on
the
exotic
fruits
of
his
cousin

a
nice
dubbel
that
is
very
well
balanced
a
bit
more
on
the
vinous
side
of
dark
fruit
flavors
and
has
a
bit
more
of
a
mineral
than
i
expected
overall
a
solid
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
again
this
is
a
damn
good
example
of
a
dubbel
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carb
but
it
did
not
damage
the
overall
beer
thumbs
up
on
this
one
d
its
a
fine
easy
drinking
dubbel
i
just
feel
the
whole
beer
is
subdued
from
the
aesthetics
to
the
flavouraroma
experience
certainly
smooth
drinking
with
a
nice
flavour
profile
if
you
look
hard
enough
for
it
but
thats
the
problem
it
had
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
was
sweet
and
fruity
the
taste
was
sweetness
and
finished
with
a
bitterness
it
has
a
medium
body
that
went
down
easy
with
no
real
hint
of
alcohol
enjoyable
brew
to
finish
the
day
with
drinkability
very
high
alcohol
content
means
this
is
never
going
to
be
drink
to
enjoy
for
a
whole
evening
probably
would
go
best
with
a
meal
taken
slowly
and
savoured
creates
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
in
the
stomach
bottle
poured
into
a
large
snifter
purplish
brown
fizzy
with
a
slight
tan
head
smells
like
purple
candy
or
artificial
grape
flavoring
along
with
cherries
and
other
dark
fruits
taste
is
a
milder
version
of
the
smell
with
a
strong
initial
burst
of
the
grape
that
mellows
out
quickly
fairly
watered
down
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
decent
drinkability
but
not
that
exciting
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
probably
sip
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
given
the
sweetness
ill
enjoy
this
beer
while
i
drink
it
but
im
not
sure
ill
get
it
again
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
dubbel
fn
if
it
werent
for
the
wet
dog
smell
id
have
rated
higher
i
dont
know
if
its
from
the
aging
but
this
beer
is
just
flat
out
a
work
of
art
bottle
dark
pour
with
thin
white
head
very
winey
grape
aromas
dry
fruity
and
sweet
taste
is
quite
fruity
lots
of
plums
and
grapes
some
alcohol
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
alcohol
presence
a
very
interesting
dubbel
which
is
not
my
favourite
style
d
nice
and
easy
to
drink
abv
is
noticeable
but
it
is
mostly
once
it
opens
up
still
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
nice
appearance
nose
and
taste
a
drinkable
beer
that
can
be
done
any
time
of
the
year
d
for
me
its
a
sipper
but
a
darn
good
one
take
your
time
and
enjoy
d
good
rich
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
and
very
satisfying
wouldnt
have
a
session
on
it
but
will
definately
drink
again
drank
this
one
in
a
hotel
in
the
south
of
holland
on
tap
it
was
served
in
the
original
la
trappe
chalice
its
a
beer
as
can
be
expected
from
one
of
the
abbey
brewers
delicious
double
with
a
very
nice
dark
colour
and
a
nice
head
in
the
glass
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticable
but
with
65
thats
to
be
expected
this
one
can
be
bought
in
holland
in
every
liquorstore
d
very
good
dubbel
overall
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
overall
this
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
did
serve
as
a
good
representation
of
the
style
even
if
it
was
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
worth
a
shot
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
very
bubbly
i
could
make
a
night
of
this
beer
but
probably
would
choose
something
over
this
o
not
as
good
as
the
trippel
in
my
opinion
but
would
do
it
again
d
like
a
fine
wine
la
trappe
dubbel
is
well
worth
savouring
a
great
find
on
tap
certainly
one
ill
go
for
again
great
stuff
the
beer
is
very
smooth
its
great
if
you
want
a
couple
more
and
want
to
try
a
medium
complex
and
very
well
balanced
beer
d
this
was
my
last
attempt
in
the
future
i
will
focus
on
their
quad
and
the
isidor
if
they
keep
producing
it
i
usually
will
not
comment
on
how
other
members
rate
their
beers
because
everyone
is
entitled
to
their
own
opinions
but
with
that
said
how
can
some
rate
this
a
c
or
even
worse
a
c
i
understand
there
are
better
dubbels
out
there
but
come
on
now
seriously
i
wish
some
would
just
give
this
beer
a
little
bit
of
the
respect
that
it
deserves
damaging
ratings
ought
to
be
withheld
for
gardenvariety
americanstyle
lagers
while
a
very
nice
beer
there
are
plenty
of
better
ones
that
are
pretty
easy
to
get
drinkability
the
alcohol
hotness
harms
the
drinkability
the
residual
sweetness
most
likely
needed
to
help
counter
balance
the
hotness
ends
up
being
a
bit
cloying
its
true
to
style
and
interesting
but
has
some
aforementioned
flaws
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
biting
carbonation
corked
and
cages
750ml
bottle
clear
deep
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
reddish
hue
a
generous
cap
of
dark
beige
foam
fell
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
and
left
a
few
islands
of
bubbles
floating
on
top
of
the
beer
malty
aroma
bready
toffee
light
dried
fruit
character
slight
alcohol
but
fairly
mild
overall
bitterness
was
higher
than
i
was
expecting
but
still
on
the
low
side
malt
sweetness
and
toffee
up
front
followed
by
fruit
cherry
plums
sugar
light
alcohol
in
the
finish
carbonation
was
higher
than
average
which
gave
it
a
lighter
texture
slight
warmth
pretty
tasty
overall
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
enough
but
it
lacks
overall
depth
and
interest
to
make
this
a
beer
to
come
back
to
more
than
once
a
nice
dubbel
light
with
a
good
belgian
fruity
phenolic
sweetness
this
beer
pours
a
dark
mahogany
translucent
without
the
murkiness
i
was
expecting
the
head
dissipates
quickly
but
sprouted
nicely
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
and
at
least
a
fair
ring
around
the
outside
of
my
goblet
the
aroma
has
a
strong
phenolic
bandaid
note
although
its
not
unpleasant
there
are
also
strong
belgian
stone
fruit
flavors
a
touch
of
earth
and
a
splash
of
rum
its
a
fruity
sweet
beer
like
a
quad
without
depth
and
punch
again
that
sounds
critical
and
thats
not
entirely
meant
i
dont
always
want
to
drink
big
heavy
quads
but
i
still
prefer
them
in
terms
of
ratings
while
its
more
drinkable
than
a
quad
it
still
tends
to
make
my
mouth
turn
when
i
take
a
large
sip
if
nothing
else
koningshoeven
deserves
an
award
for
packing
this
much
flavor
in
a
6
5
abv
beer
it
might
not
be
the
most
complex
belgian
flavor
but
its
a
big
assertive
sweetness
drinkability
like
i
said
probably
my
favorite
dubbel
a
sipper
and
great
for
dessert
cloudy
muddy
amber
body
caramel
and
sweet
dark
fruit
on
the
nose
caramel
chocolate
spice
earth
and
that
classic
yeastiness
on
the
palate
medium
body
a
good
dubbel
from
the
only
trappist
abbey
outside
of
belgium
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
compared
to
some
of
its
trappist
counterparts
this
beer
is
unremarkable
perhaps
that
comparison
is
unfair
but
when
the
phrase
authentic
trappist
product
is
on
the
bottle
the
bar
is
set
pretty
high
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
ths
on
tap
at
novare
res
it
was
poured
into
my
uprising
chalice
te
beer
is
a
great
colordark
red
like
a
glass
of
port
it
lost
some
appearance
point
because
of
the
disappointing
head
there
were
some
bubbles
atop
my
glass
when
it
was
poured
but
by
the
time
the
glass
was
brought
to
me
it
had
largely
disappeared
not
even
a
skim
was
left
and
i
was
sitting
at
the
bar
the
aroma
is
rich
and
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
you
can
pick
up
some
alcohol
in
the
taste
as
well
along
with
sweet
grapes
there
is
a
lingering
feeling
of
sourness
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
but
much
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
the
amount
of
carbonation
and
fruit
flavors
remind
me
of
a
grape
ginger
ale
im
not
sure
if
that
is
a
good
or
bad
thing
overall
its
a
decent
beer
although
there
are
both
trappist
and
nontrappist
dubbels
i
enjoy
more
drinkability
paired
well
with
the
1920
silent
film
the
parsons
widow
directed
by
carl
th
dreyer
still
though
its
not
exactly
the
best
belgian
dubbel
on
the
block
as
its
beaten
out
just
barely
at
least
for
me
by
both
the
rochefort
6
and
chimay
red

reviewed
from
notes
april

a
nicely
done
belgian
dubbel
but
could
use
a
bit
more
in
the
nose
and
flavor
departments
the
head
was
also
a
bit
modest
but
retained
nicely
overall
a
good
beer
i
have
had
better
and
worse
the
la
trappe
offerings
seem
to
get
treated
as
the
black
sheep
of
the
trappist
world
but
its
a
little
unfair
this
dubbel
is
good
sample
of
the
style
and
worthy
of
anyones
consideration
addendum
after
the
yeast
is
swirled
in
nose
becomes
noticeably
creamier
and
the
head
gets
a
quick
revitalization
taste
becomes
a
little
more
raisiny
and
the
finish
gains
a
touch
of
added
tartness
overall
a
decent
brew
but
the
taste
was
just
a
little
too
sweet
to
make
it
a
real
winner
as
such
this
one
didnt
drink
away
all
that
easily
one
id
have
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
therell
probably
be
something
better
at
the
bar
ill
enjoy
more
d
a
nice
sweet
treat
the
alcohol
may
be
low
but
the
sweetness
makes
this
a
bit
of
a
sipper
a
very
clean
and
enjoyable
dubbel
a
very
tasty
dubbel
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
especially
to
people
looking
to
get
into
trappist
ales
or
to
have
around
as
a
beer
for
those
guests
you
have
over
who
can
be
impressed
by
more
artisan
beers
and
just
need
someone
to
show
them

way

a

light

creamy
and
smooth
one
of
the
better
dubbels
ive
had
not
up
there
with
the
westy
or
the
westmalle
the
aroma
became
a
bit
more
pronounced
as
i
progressed
into
the
beer
but
for
what
i
payed
for
this
but
one
of
these
is
enough
for
the

i
may
have
had
an
unusual
experience
but
there
is
inconsistency
between
bottles
some
are
closer
to
a
sour
than
an
ale
and
with
the
sour
bottles
the
carbonation
is
overwhelming
on
draft
it
is
much
better
and
is
closer
to
the
dubbel
in
flavor
drinking
this
beer
as
i
review
very
good
my
favorite
from
db
amazingly
close
to
chimay
its
a
good
substitute
very
good

very
drinkable
cant
find
it

trying
it

a

on
the
sweet
side
but
impressed
by
how
its
so
easy
to
drink
o
overall
a
decent
beer
for
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
nice

belgian
style

very

inconsistent
carbonation
from

to

this
is
my
new
favorite
spicing
is
fruity
slightly
punchier
alcohol
kick
than
expected
too
much
on
the
with
spices
side
and
not
enough
on
the
ale
side
and
not
nearly
carbonated
enough
for
a
belgian
style
loving
this
brew
looks
like
a
dubbel
so
we
are
squared
away
there
sweet
nose
of
dark
malts
raisins
caramel
and
spice
with
a
kick
of
alcohol
sweet
palate
dried
plums
slightly
warming
balanced
spicing
mild
phenols
dark
sugar
mild
broth
modest
hopping
show
a
quite
complex
brew
well
within
the
style
and
a
great
sipper
picked
this
up
as
part
of
mixed
six
to
give
a
try
i
tend
to
like
belgians
but
have
little
experience
with
devils
backbone
so
not
sure
what
to
expect
love
the
color
i
will
call
it
deep
purple
very
little
head
or
carbonation
excellent
smell
you
definitely
get
the
belgian
in
the
nose
mixed
bag
with
the
taste
interesting
and
tasty
balanced
pretty
easy
to
drink
which
gives
it
a
little
bonus
overall
due
to
alcohol
content
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
gladly
drink
again
and
would
probably
buy
depending
upon
the
cost
o
a
surprisingly
poor
effort
from
db
not
a
lot
here
and
the
lack
of
body
and
carbonation
makes
it
even
more
unimpressive
o
decent
but
without
amazing
qualities
sip
or
skip
sip
yes
sir
overall
would
say
its
an
easy
drinking
dubbel
when
you
are
not
looking
to
analyze
every
sip
might
be
purchasing
this
again
for
a
sessionable
ale
with
some
dubbel
flavors
after
finishing
the
6
pack
i
think
my
review
has
to
stand
i
had
a
couple
that
were
ok
but
46
being
unpleasant
isnt
good
enough
to
change
the
review
inconsistent
bad
processes
bad
distributor
or
store
who
knows
but
ill
steer
clear
of
this
brew
for
a
while
maybe
i
was
swayed
by
the
7
5
abv
but
this
beer
just
hit
the
spot
for
me
its
not
horribly
complex
and
yet
it
left
me
feeling
utterly
satisfied
id
definitely
try
it
again
o
not
bad
but
not
quite
a
dubbel
o
some
good
flavors
going
on
but
it
seems
to
fall
off
at
the
end
i
enjoyed
the
dark
cherry
notes
but
wish
they
would
have
stayed
to
the
finish
pours
into
a
goblet
an
amber
hued
chesnut
brown
with
a
thinner
slight
off
white
head
atop
maybe
the
cleanest
aroms
of
any
dubbel
that
i
have
come
acrosssome
light
fige
and
raisin
but
its
really
light
lightly
carbonated
and
a
little
thinner
than
most
of
the
style
i
have
come
across
flavors
are
on
the
lighter
side
with
dark
fruit
and
sweet
alcohol
notessome
phenol
spiciness
plays
a
small
role
i
have
really
liked
the
other
db
offerings
i
have
hadthis
not
so
much
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
particularly
good
it
seems
that
you
can
only
get
so
much
flavor
out
of
a
belgian
style
beer
without
bottle
fermenting
the
beer
is
heavily
frontloaded
and
the
end
could
use
some
more
hop
character
that
being
said
it
has
some
good
flavors
is
sweet
without
being
cloying
and
is
quite
drinkable
overall
an
ok
dubbel
although
a
little
to
bitter
and
tanniny
in
flavor
for
me
i
also
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
one
or
two
would
be
fine
o
a
really
fine
belgian
ale
from
db
i
thought
azrael
was
pretty
good
too
so
they
are
starting
to
hit
their
stride
in
a
style
besides
lagers
if
you
like
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
yeast
character
in
your
dubbel
this
is
a
great
beer
for
you
o
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
slowly
sipped
but
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
with
belgian
breweris
being
the
benchmark
for
this
style
this
is
a
great
example
from
the
other
side
of
the
pond
well
done
one
of
the
best
american

almost
exactly
like
my
homebrew
from
a
belgian
strong
ale
kit
a
bold
and
earthy
dubbel
this
is
definitely
a
worldclass
brew

i
respect
this
beer
more
than
i
love
it
theres
a
unique
grabbag
of
flavors
and
aromas
here
but
i
think
maybe
the
floral
perfumelike
characteristics
are
a
tad
too
prominent
overall
though
a
good
classy
brew
this
is
one
of
the
best

in

im
in

sipping

down
my
favorite
beer
one
great
american
example
of
the

style
dubbel
being
a
belgian
fan
this
is
definitely
a
must
try
regularly
now
one
of
my
go
to
dubbels
overall
this
one
is
definitely
worth
buying
good
beer
for
a
good
price
working
off
old
notes
will
update
with
more
details
ifwhen
i
have
another
o
well
executed
dubbel
good
and
drinkable
its
okay
not
my
style
of
belgian
overall
a
rather
nice
abbey
style
ale
overall
with
a
nice
drinkability
and
a
good
blend
of
fruit
booze
and
yeasty
spice
a
rather
well
done
dubbel
that
is
quite
nicely
priced
a
good
go
to
dubbel
style
ale
an
excellent
dubbel
that
really
rivals
the
belgians
spot
on
job
by
new
belgium
bringing
an
authentic
belgian
flavor
while
still
being
inexpensive
very
good
just
not
too
smooth
dark
amber
like
honey
with
creamy
head
and
moderate

smells
fantastic
like
banana

taste

overall

really

this
would
go

with

clear

light
tan
head
of
decent
size
spots

the
excellent

malt
front
figs

raisins
flow
next
herbaceous
biting
bitterness
gives
a
bit
of
a
jolt
but
it
works
so
well
a
light
coffee
lingers
with
mocha
notes
as
it
fades
to
hops
feel
is
to
notch
full
and
smooth
with
a
creamy
carbonation
not
a
session
ale
but
quite
easy
drinking
a
superb
dubbel
period
love
this
one
overall
very
nice
smooth
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
night
in
colorado
smells
fantastic
looks
like
a
beer
and
it
tastes
too
good
to
be
mass
produced
from
new
belgium
i
love
it
and
will
drink
it
until
the
springtime
comes
around
a
beautiful
deep
dark
goldenbrown
bubbles
bubbles
bubbles
nice
tan

with
pretty
nice

is

fresh
baked
muffins
with
hints
of
banana
and
candy
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
nor
an
expert
on
this
style
of
beer
but
i
will
have
to
say
this
is
one
nice
brew
taste
is
spectacular
with
fresh
baked
pastry
and
sweet
malt
notes
i
also
get
some
banana
and
molasses
also
feels
light
on
the
palate
with
some
minor
alcohol
twang
but
thats
ok
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
basically
i
cant
think
of
anything
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
i
dont
believe
in
perfect
hence
my
unwillingness
to
hand
out
5s
and
im
sure
ill
probably
find
beers
i
like
more
eventually
but
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
thats
really
amazed
me
so
farand
even
better
than
that
it
was
still
amazing
the
second
time
i
had
it
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
darker
belgianstyle
ales
and
having
this
one
again
in
the
future
pours
a
dark
copper
almost
brown
color
with
a
thick
head
that
dissipates
to
ring
like
lace
great
aroma
maple
syrup
bannanas
a
boozy
liqueur
like
feel
and
even
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
is
fruity
malty
sweet
and
with
a
dry
boozy
finish
good
feel
lively
carbonation
that
settles
as
the
drink
warms
this
is
my
first
foray
into
new
belgium
brewing
co
and
am
thus
far
impressed
a
good
interpretation
of
belgian
dubbel
i
love
the
belgian
malt
aroma
and
taste
the
subtle
yeast
flavor
gives
it
that
classic
dubbel
feel
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
new
belgium
brews
overall
a
wonderfully
complex
tasty
drinkable
dubbel
and
what
a
bargain
new
belgian
never
ceases
to
amaze
by
putting
out
delicious
flavorful
yearround
beers
like
this
at
amazing

overall
i
really
like
belgians
and
belgian
style
beers
and
after
steering
away
from
this
beer
for
a
while
i
found
it
is
really
good
and
pretty
darn
close
to
style
not
sure
what
could
be
improved
here
just
a
really
nice

take
on
the

be
sure

color
is
right
on

money
as
it
is
a

i
thought
the
head
was
a
little
thin
and
it
didnt
persist
as
long
as
i
thought
it
should
it
may
be
slightly
under
carbonated
and
if
i
were
to
grade
it
down
in
one
area
in
particular
it
would
be
mouthfeel
that
said
it
is
very
clear
dont
think
this
beer
is
bottleconditioned
and
is
in
the
right
ballpark
as
far
as
the
complexity
of
flavor
you
would
expect
from
a
belgian
dubbel
raisin
clove
spiciness
etc
it
leaves
scattered
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
maybe
the
slightest
taste
of
alcohol
but
very
subtle
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
come
back
to
it
again
it
was
half
the
price
of
a
chimay
red
4pack
which
while
superior
is
not
an
everyday
beer
poured
a
copper
body
with
good
head
and
lace
ring
along
with
an
aroma
of
dark
fruits
and
hints
of
caramelcandi
sugar
malt
sweetness
and
touches
of
spice
rather
light
bodied
maybe
medium
with
a
smoothness
that
belies
the
dark
fruit
and
sweet
tastes
bc
there
are
some
raisins
and
figs
in
here
possible
other
fruits
like
tropical
but
cant
get
a
handle
on
them
but
there
is
also
a
great
underlying
sweetness
to
this
beer
that
i
can
only
describe
as
really
sweet
caramel
the
figs
toffee
candi
sugar
sweet
fruit
just
cant
pinpoint
it
a
rather
light
and
easy
to
drink
belgian
style
ale
that
is
quite
enjoyable
one
thing
it
has
that
almost
no
other
dubbel
ive
tried
has
is
a
cool
nutty
flavor
it
shows
up
at
different
times
and
might
be
most
present
in
fresher
bottles
this
one
has
been
in
the
fridge
a
month
and
the
nut
flavor
is
not
showing
up
much
its
fantastic
when
its
there
though
its
not
part
of
the
style
overall
it
is
a
decent
interpretation
of
authentic
dubbels
but
i
dont
really
agree
with
the
outstanding
ratings
good
but
not
amazing
new
belgium
abbey
belgian
style
ale
3

borderline
bb
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
belgian
that
has
bod
flavors
of
banana
yeast
spices
and
pear
and
white
grape
really
nicely
complex
and
balanced
and
a
pretty
impressive
offering
from
new
belgium
take
your
time
with
this
one
and
enjoy
the
flavors
that
build
and
transition
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
recommend
and
great
price
point
o
a
pretty
tasty
dubbel
which
is
saying
something
since
its
hard
for
me
to
greatly
appreciate
the
style
overall
one
of
my
favorite
year
round
offerings
from
new
belgium
just
a
really
great
beer
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
the
only
surprise
is
that
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
one
nice
i
am
immediately
reminded
of
the
new
belgium
trippel
i
had
earlier
today
both
of
these
beers
have
a
huge
belgian
yeast
presence
adding
fruitiness
to
the
beer
unlike
its
brother
abbey
doesnt
have
much
tartness
at
all
the
malt
body
reminds
me
of
a
dopple
bock
makes
sense
seeing
as
this
a
belgian
dubbel
a
lot
of
specialty
grains
went
into
the
mash
for
this
chocolate
and
sweet
sugars
are
very
prevalent
this
is
really
smooth
and
drinkable
especially
for
7
abv
all
the
flavors
come
through
cleanly
and
in
full
force
the
hop
presence
is
negligible
this
is
my
first
abbey
its
great
ale
with
lots
of
body
after
my
first
sip
i
thought
that
this
was
a
typical
ale
but
after
about
three
swallows
the
flavor
exploded
and
i
immediately
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
drink
i
highly
recommend
great
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
every
aspect
of
this
beer
vast
array
of
flavors
and
aromas
make
this
beer
fascinating
presence
of
alcohol
is
alluring
this
beer
evolves
as
you
drink
it
overall
3
25
better
than
ok
thats
the
best
way
to
describe
it
this
brew
has
a
very
nice
nose
a
far
better
than
average
taste
but
the
other
elements
thats
where
the
macro
is
obvious
and
throws
the
average
score
of
the
beer
off
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
strictly
amateur
sorry
to
be
so
harsh
but
those
are
the
breaks
pours
out
fairly
dark
brown
but
still
clear
to
some
extent
not
dark
brown
but
had
a
tiny
halffinger
head
i
think
the
head
was
fairly
white
but
missed
it
looking
at
the
color
of
the
beer
if
i
had
to
make
an
educated
guess
it
was
white
with
just
a
tiny
tinge
of
brown
smell
is
definitely
belgian
sweetness
that
i
havent
smelled
in
a
while
been
a
while
since
i
drank
belgians
really
sweet
banana
yeasty
smell
that
is
just
heaven
to
the
nose
maybe
its
just
cause
i
havent
drank
a
belgian
lately
but
just
smells
amazing
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
definate
belgian
yeasty
taste
like
bananas
and
cloves
really
tasty
mouthfeel
is
a
lighter
medium
and
definitely
fits
the
style
overall
i
am
really
surprised
how
much
i
like
this
beer
just
got
a
mixed
12er
for
session
beer
tonight
and
thought
id
give
this
a
try
glad
i
did
because
of
this
beer
o
overall
a
nice
beer
nothing
special
but
certainly
worthy
of
a
drink
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
flavors
and
aromas
were
very
well
balanced
im
not
a
hug
fan
of
the
style
but
if
i
were
i
would
probably
buy
this
from
time
to
time
i
have
always
enjoyed
the
new
belgium
beers
and
the
abbey
along
with
the
trippel
is
my
favorite
of
their
regular
lineup
it
pours
a
deep
transparent
amber
with
a
decent
creamy
head
and
a
generous
amount
of
carbonation
the
aroma
hits
you
instantly
with
the
sweet
belgian
yeast
that
follows
through
to
the
taste
there
are
also
hints
of
banana
caramel
and
fruity
malt
in
the
smooth
full
bodied
mouthfeel
there
is
definitely
a
lot
going
on
in
this
complex
and
well
balanced
beer
especially
for
a
regular
offering
from
a
brewer
o
great
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
spicy
yeast
notes
a
very
flavorful
and
affordable
abbey
style
ale
othis
was
a
complex
beer
that
has
many
things
going
on
as
the
beer
warms
it
seems
to
bring
more
flavors
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
i
must
say
and
still
so
enjoyable
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
likes
dubbels
and
belgian
styles
o
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
new
belgium
was
going
for
authentic
with
abbey
and
theyve
succeeded
in
my
opinion
i
think
it
hits
all
of
the
right
notes
in
terms
of
aroma
and
flavor
for
the
style
is
it
the
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
no
but
its
one
of
the
better
examples
outside
of
belgium
without
a
doubt
new
belgium
is
new
to
delaware
and
from
the
handful
of
their
brews
that
ive
tried
this
has
been
the
best
one
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
by
new
belgium
i
almost
always
have
a
few
in
the
fridge
i
find
this
to
be
a
great
beer
for
friends
who
may
be
new
to
craft
beer
its
got
a
solid
abv
and
is
really
delicious
i
paired
this
with
cheesecake
and
the
two
couldnt
have
gone
better
together
this
is
an
absolute
must
try
overall
excellent
beer
balanced
smooth
yet
high
flavored
and
easy
to
drink
seriously
you
can
put
this
american
brewed
ale
right
up
against
any
belgian
brewed
dubbel
and
it
will
hold
its
own
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
worth
seeking
out
o
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
good
beer
i
just
prefer
my
dark
belgians
to
have
more
of
a
dark
fruit
character
to
them
and
i
just
dont
find
that
here
also
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
overall
this
could
be
a
daily
drinker
pours
a
nice
mahogany
with
noticeable
carbonation
an
ambertinged
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
smells
of
complex
malt
nice
but
not
something
i
seek
out
the
taste
is
really
nice
even
on
a
hot
day
this
tastes
good
this
will
be
a
great
late
fall
brew
or
after
a
day
on
the
slopes
im
not
a
belgian
ale
drinker
but
this
is
a
nicely
done
beer
overall
another
damn
good
beer
from
new
belgium
its
good
to
see
that
the
brewery
while
following
the
path
blazed
by
a
lot
of
the
california
and
oregon
breweries
with
multiple
ipas
and
numerous
other
hopforward
beers
that
when
they
turn
back
to
their
belgiuminspired
beers
they
can
still
produce
some
of
the
best
in
the
country
i
love
this
dubbel
overall
a
great
beer
for
after
a
modest
meal
3
of
these
aftereats
will
put
you
in
bed
sooner
than
you
expected
unless
you
are
used
to
dubbels
and
trippels
keep
it
coming
new
belgium
brewery
o
i
thought
that
this
dubbel
was
a
good
represention
of
of
the
style
and
wasnt
overly
sweet
let
me
state
upfron
that
belgian
style
offering
are
not
my
favorite
but
i
loved
this
it
pours
a
deeep
amber
with
a
small
head
great
retention
and
lacing
taboot
taboot
the
nose
is
mostly
bananas
but
i
also
get
some
clove
and
spices
taste
is
very
sweet
upfront
maybe
apples
bananas
and
asssorted
other
fruits
the
finish
is
dry
and
yeasty
but
not
bad
ive
had
a
few
other
belgian
ales
where
the
finish
was
so
yeasty
i
just
didnt
like
it
here
it
is
more
restrained
i
like
the
mouthfeel
lots
of
carbonation
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
just
too
yeasty
and
bubblegummy
typical
new
belgium
pours
to
a
nice
white
head
moderate
lacing
and
brown
amber
color
aroma
is
a
complex
blend
of
fruits
spices
vanilla
clove
and
specialty
malts
flavor
is
a
complex
blend
of
caramel
like
flavors
complex
sweet
spicy
and
fruity
refreshing
clove
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
overall
this
beer
rocks
my
palate
and
totally
owns
my
nose
overall
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
since
new
belgium
made
a
great
trippel
this
one
was
just
slightly
lacking
in
all
aspects
overall
a
decent
attempt
at
a
dubbel
by
new
belgium
and
i
really
think
they
pulled
it
off
it
is
still
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
for
the
availability
and
price
it
is
hard
to
beat
bottom
line
good
beer
worth
drinking
over
and
over
new
belgium
abbey
ale
comes
so
close
to
selling
the
authentic
belgian
character
to
me
but
alas
it
reveals
too
much
caramel
sweetness
and
earthen
yeast
character
that
i
expect
from
americanmade
belgian
beers
where
those
are
overly
simplistic
and
sweet
this
one
doesnt
go
that
far
but
approaches
the
dubbel
ale
taste
with
somewhat
timid
character
pours
a
clear
amberbrown
with
a
medium
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
toasted
grain
taste
begins
with
some
fruit
sweetness
then
some
toasted
grain
and
finishing
with
some
tart
clean
earthiness
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
not
the
best
nb
beer
ive
had
a
little
bit
dissapointing
overall
a
good
example
of
this
style
ill
have
it
again
o
i
could
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
its
got
a
very
nice
pronounced
flavor
but
with
the
body
and
level
of
carbonation
leaves
you
able
to
continue
on
without
getting
fatigued
id
pick
up
a
6
pack
any
day
o
a
good
example
of
a
malty
belgian
really
impressed
by
this
sampler
offering
definitely
a
good
beer
for
the
dubbel
style
especially
for
the
price
and
availability
o
okay
beer
good
representation
of
the
style
but
couldnt
help
but
feel
that
something
was
a
little
off
a
very
very
good
beer
overall
that
was
easy
to
drink
true
to
the
style
and
got
better
and
more
flavorful
as
it
warmed
an
excellent
american
version
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
produced
stateside
which
i
highly
recommend
trying
overall
a
very
nice
dubbel
i
wish
we
could
get
new
belgium
here
i
try
to
get
some
of
their
beer
each
time
i
travel
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
spices
belgian
yeast
and
a
very
nice
banana
bread
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
banana
bread
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
and
some
tasty
flavors
tasteplumapple
spicy
yeast
a
bit
subdued
but
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
a
nice
take
on
the
style
thats
very
approachable
personally
i
was
surprised
at
how
lovely
tasting
and
reasonably
priced
this
beer
was
now
and
then
we
all
deserve
a
nice
surprise
even
a
drinkable
surprise
in
a
tulip
glass
a
very
well
done
dubbel
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
enjoy
having
it
again
mouthfeel
thin
light
bodied
nice
mellow
carbonation
o
malt
bomb
very
good
and
artfully
balanced
must
try
everything
a
belgian
is
supposed
to
be
dark
fruits
banana
chocolate
caramel
coffee
and
roasted
malts
perfectly
balanced
and
complex
and
still
very
smooth
i
sacrificed
my
last
bottle
to
a
pot
of
chili
i
think
its
time
to
reload
the
appearance
is
much
more
attractive
than
the
traditional
murky
brown
dubbel
the
body
is
clear
and
almost
a
glowing
shade
of
brown
the
smell
is
full
of
dry
fruits
like
fig
raisins
and
apricots
and
provides
a
great
preview
of
what
is
to
come
the
taste
is
very
good
in
terms
of
showcasing
fruity
esters
but
the
overall
flavoring
s
short
of
what
is
hinted
at
by
the
aroma
there
is
a
bit
too
much
simplicity
and
dilution
in
the
flavor
department
the
feel
in
the
mouth
is
slippery
oily
and
smooth
the
beer
goes
down
easy
but
i
want
to
find
out
if
this
has
ever
been
recast
as
a
quad
because
thats
what
it
is
aspiring
towards
i
like
even
more
malt
than
this
in
a
dubbel
but
this
is
still
a
tasty
brew
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
would
recommend
everyone
give
it
a
shot
at
least
once
in
the
top
10
american
dubbels
fantastic
drink
all
my
favorite
attributes
in
a
beer
great
taste
drinkability
and
a
high
abv
thats
well
hidden
dont
hesitate
to
grab
some
i
only
wish
this
was
available
in
12s
where
i
live
this
is
all
coming
from
someone
who
isnt
a
fan
of
the
style
we
bought
a
bunch
of
this
drank
my
first
1
on
the
bus
up
to
vail
yesterday
this
one
is
served
more
properly
and
it
looks
real
nice
in
the
glass
lots
of
lace
the
aroma
is
ok
but
a
little
weak
its
very
smooth
and
not
very
yeasty
the
aftertaste
is
pleasant
we
have
some
good
regional
beers
to
drink
this
week
so
far
we
seem
to
have
made
good
choices
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
really
wasnt
a
true
example
of
a
dubbel
it
just
had
to
many
aspects
that
you
dont
find
in
the
traditional
dubbels
that
are
from
belgium
while
it
may
not
be
true
to
style
its
still
an
all
around
good
beer
i
think
it
should
be
listed
as
a
belgian
dark
ale
instead
so
im
not
going
to
hold
that
against
them
especially
when
new
belgium
doesnt
say
anything
about
it
being
a
dubbel
on
the
label
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
and
the
flavors
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
when
in
the
mood
but
the
sweetness
might
become
too
much
after
that
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
well
rounded
it
was
and
how
complex
the
aroma
was
those
seemed
to
be
highlights
of
this
beer
i
also
really
like
the
heavy
banana
aspect
to
this
beer
there
wasnt
really
anything
that
i
really
didnt
like
about
this
beer
but
the
sweetness
did
seem
to
get
a
little
out
of
hand
in
the
aroma
but
i
guess
that
wasnt
that
big
of
a
deal
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
in
fact
i
can
see
another
six
pack
in
the
near
future
to
keep
on
hand
for
when
people
come
over
for
the
holidays
i
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
all
in
all
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
banana
aspect
of
this
beer
and
it
reminded
me
of
one
of
my
favorite
wiezenbocks
it
almost
tasted
like
a
lighter
version
of
it
good
job
new
belgium
this
is
up
there
as
one
of
the
better
brews
i
have
had
from
them
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
o
overall
it
meets
my
expectations
and
more
its
what
i
was
hoping
for
and
i
was
not
disappointed
it
was
not
too
expensive
either
great
value
another
testament
to
nbs
greatness
recommended
by
me
of
course
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
that
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
if
not
ever
love
it
dubble
has
never
been
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
styles
but
this
one
is
comparable
to
most
dubbels
worth
seeking
out
othis
was
a
solid
representation
of
the
dubbel
style
and
perhaps
the
best
u
s
version
i
have
had
in
a
while
the
spices
are
great
the
fruit
is
there
and
the
alcohol
is
nicely
integrated
it
was
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
spice
and
sweetness
it
reminded
me
of
a
holiday
brew
actually
but
it
made
for
a
nice
dessert
overall
if
its
accessible
to
you
give
it
a
try
i
liked
it
a
lot
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
you
will
be
drunk
after
three
the
pour
was
magnifique
resulting
in
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
and
loads
of
co2
bubbles
in
evidence
nose
was
earthy
with
scents
of
dark
dried
fruits
accompanied
by
root
and
leafy
vegetables
do
people
still
have
root
cellars
it
reminded
me
of
my
paternal
grandmothers
basement
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
approaching
a
creaminess
that
it
did
not
quite
achieve
the
initial
sip
was
quite
hot
making
me
wish
that
i
had
let
this
continue
to
age
once
i
got
past
that
it
tasted
very
much
like
dried
dark
fruits
prunes
raisins
blackberries
black
raspberries
my
grandmother
was
one
of
the
last
people
i
knew
that
did
home
canning
and
this
could
have
been
a
liquid
version
of
any
of
her
fruit
preserves
finish
was
semisweet
with
the
yeast
taking
a
lot
of
the
sugar
out
of
the
equation
good
stuff
pours
a
deep
copper
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
long
lasting
with
good
lacing
smell
is
very
fruity
cherry
and
plum
notes
slightly
alcoholic
smelling
definitely
a
lot
of
sweetness
to
the
aroma
very
light
hop
aromas
taste
is
very
belgian
alcoholic
and
yeasty
theres
a
fruity
sweetness
right
up
front
with
some
caramel
malt
character
slight
earthy
bitterness
in
the
finish
low
to
medium
carbonation
with
a
full
body
and
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
strong
belgian
ale
a
little
too
fruity
and
sweet
for
my
personal
tastes
but
still
good
very
nice
nose
lots
of
ripe
bananas
and
dark
chocolate
along
with
fruits
taste
follows
nose
dry
finish
this
is
a
good
imitation
of
a
real
belgium
trappist
and
much
less
expensive
as
soon
as
we
here
in
america
learn
to
produce
the
complexity
and
perfection
of
a
true
trappist
beer
we
might
graduate
to
world
class
until
then
i
will
spend
the
money
for
the
real
deal
my
score
does
not
represent
a
comparison
to
a
true
belgian
it
represents
how
close
we
are
to
obtaining
it
oa
decent
dubbel
but
belgians
have
done
it
better
and
there
are
better
american
examples
as
well
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
deserving
of
the
name
if
you
can
not
pull
something
off
the
shelf
that
is
from
belgium
than
this
is
your
next
best
bet
i
have
a
feeling
i
would
not
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
in
a
blind
tasting
ok
i
know
im
not
the
most
well
versed
beer
geek
on
here
and
that
i
can
seem
to
be
a
hillbilly
from
the
hills
who
just
had
his
first
real
beer
but
this
is
my
second
all
time
favorite
that
i
keep
in
my
fridge
as
my
go
to
beer
the
cost
factor
makes
this
the
beer
i
drink
weekly
if
i
didnt
have
to
pay
3
dollars
plus
a
bottle
for
ommegang
abbey
and
drive
an
hour
to
get
it
i
would
keep
iit
but
this
one
i
feel
like
for
an
american
made
beer
really
captures
the
spirit
of
the
style
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
small
1
5
finger
head
with
small
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
very
pleasant
and
the
taste
starts
sweet
and
finishes
a
little
on
the
dry
perfect
combo
for
me
you
can
buy
a
dubbel
from
one
of
the
trappist
that
are
better
i
know
but
6
bucks
a
bottle
or
10
bucks
a
six
pack
at
the
price
range
this
one
is
about
as
good
as
i
can
find
o
appearance
was
good
but
lacking
substantial
head
smell
showed
no
alcohol
nor
malts
but
had
a
nice
estery
profile
taste
was
by
far
its
best
feature
with
wonderful
complexity
could
use
a
bit
of
carbonation
o
new
belgium
makes
it
easy
and
relatively
inexpensive
to
experience
the
joys
of
belgian
ales
an
excellent
abbey
very
good
beer
rjt
o
with
a
brewery
name
like
new
belgium
a
belgianinfluenced
beer
should
be
no
surprise
abbey
from
new
belgium
takes
the
already
potent
complex
belgian
yeasts
and
makes
them
explode
in
this
beer
filling
the
senses
with
deep
esters
of
fruit
and
earthiness
that
pairs
well
with
the
sweet
malt
and
mildly
earthy
hops
this
beers
strength
both
in
alcohol
and
flavor
pushes
it
towards
being
a
coolerweather
sipper
oi
challenge
you
to
find
a
better
dubbel
for
this
price
its
pretty
awesome
doesnt
taste
what
i
expect
from
an
american
dubbel
either
it
doesnt
taste
completely
authentic
but
definitely
not
artificial
either
i
do
recommend
glad
i
got
the
6pack
o
a
solid
brew
and
an
accurate
representation
of
the
style
in
fact
i
think
i
like
this
one
a
bit
more
than
some
of
the
belgian
dubbels
for
the
simple
fact
that
the
malts
seemed
to
have
been
tamed
a
bit
on
this
one
allowing
more
of
the
complexity
to
show
through
new
belgiums
abbey
ale
pours
a
fairly
clear
redorange
with
just
more
than
two
fingers
worth
of
white
foam
capping
the
beer
head
retention
is
just
ok
and
lacing
is
har
to
come
by
the
nose
has
a
nice
balance
between
esters
and
phenols
lots
of
banana
plum
and
fig
are
the
primary
aromas
but
theres
a
healthy
undercurrent
of
spice
and
clove
the
whole
thing
could
stand
to
jump
out
of
the
glass
a
little
bit
more
though
the
flavor
profile
isnt
as
well
balanced
especially
on
the
colder
side
the
beers
a
bit
of
a
phenolic
mess
with
very
little
else
coming
through
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
though
the
more
fruity
aspects
of
the
beer
start
to
take
on
more
prominence
the
beer
still
tastes
a
little
bit
too
heavily
of
pepper
and
clove
for
my
taste
but
its
definitely
better
the
body
is
solidly
lightweight
but
the
carbonation
doesnt
have
the
liveliness
of
the
best
belgian
style
brews
new
belgiums
abbey
ale
is
an
alright
take
on
a
dubbel
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
im
not
a
fan
of
new
belgium
but
this
is
an
impressive
beer
i
normally
buy
singles
of
beers
but
am
considering
buying
a
sixer
or
more
of
this
relatively
easy
to
drink
will
give
most
belgian
beers
a
run
for
their
money
right
up
with
the
best
american
brewed
dubbels
poured
at
the
brewery
a
clear
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
creamy
ecru
head
lots
of
dark
fruit
notes
with
plum
raisin
and
cherry
most
prominent
balancing
spicy
notes
of
cinnamon
vanilla
and
coriander
add
depth
good
dryness
despite
the
creamy
mouthfeel
touch
of
herbal
hop
flavor
but
little
bitterness
seriously
good
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brownamber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
yeast
malts
taste
is
good
dark
fruits
a
good
bit
of
malts
a
touch
of
alcohol
lots
of
flavor
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
beer
worth
seeking
out
o
new
belgium
does
the
dubbel
justice
an
ale
that
id
buy
again
especially
at
this
price
excellent
quality
memorable
flavor
o
a
very
wellrounded
american
take
on
the
belgian
dubbel
drinks
pretty
nicely
considering
the
alcohol
content
and
richness
cheers
o
whereas
something
like
rochefort
8
invites
sips
purely
so
one
can
pick
out
its
subtleties
and
storylike
progression
of
flavors
this
invites
sips
simply
because
its
likable
and
easy
to
drink
not
incredible
but
a
decent
nofrills
dubbel
after
my
less
than
thrilling
experience
with
my
last
new
belgian
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
i
was
pleased
to
find
a
strong
and
inviting
nose
but
initially
disappointed
with
a
somewhat
harsh
taste
and
finish
by
the
second
fill
of
my
wine
glass
the
taste
seemed
to
have
mellowed
out
more
and
i
found
myself
enjoying
the
red
caramel
apple
notes
all
and
all
i
pretty
damn
good
example
of
an
american
brewed
belgain
that
due
to
its
availability
and
low
cost
will
most
likely
become
my
staple
of
the
style
in
my
beer
fridge
overall
a
pretty
good
tasting
take
on
a
dubbel
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
the
style
but
the
fruit
presence
is
very
good
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
americanized
belgian
traditional
flavors
with
excellent
drinkability
delicious
and
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
overall
good
not
great
the
taste
is
nice
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
needed
sweetness
its
just
a
tad
too
blandthin
for
me
still
a
good
beer
that
id
have
no
issues
drinking
again
a
decent
ale
though
admittedly
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
dubbel
style
the
sweet
fruitiness
is
cut
by
the
spice
of
the
hops
to
make
it
interesting
in
the
end
however
it
is
simply
too
sweet
for
me
deep
amber
2
fingers
off
white
head
aromas
of
sweet
caramel
roasted
grains
vanilla
rum
very
subtle
caramel
taste
with
a
hint
of
orange
zest
the
boozy
rum
aroma
isnt
as
up
front
on
the
taste
medium
bodied
with
fizzy
carbonation
slight
creaminess
not
a
bad
abbey
ale
at
all
nothing
spectacular
but
its
nice
to
taste
so
many
subtle
flavors
that
blend
well
together
o
a
little
fleeting
for
an
abbey
ale
with
more
phenol
than
it
should
have
feel
is
good
and
in
line
with
the
product
though
i
think
a
more
robust
bottle
conditioning
would
improve
things
from
many
a
perspective
like
their
trippel
this
is
solid
and
lacking
only
in
the
nuances
of
things
good
product
and
a
great
value
o
a
good
beer
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
good
for
a
change
i
like
it
o
a
little
better
than
average
the
carbonation
is
a
turn
off
compared
to
other
belgium
style
ales
but
definitely
a
better
than
average
beer
o
this
is
a
fairly
solid
dubbel
and
the
spiciness
is
nice
but
the
banana
and
sweetness
begin
to
overwhelm
poured
this
dubbel
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
brown
color
produced
a
off
white
head
nice
retention
and
decent
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
dubbel
reminds
me
of
ripe
banana
and
peppercorn
medium
in
body
this
brew
featured
malted
grain
fresh
brown
bread
ripe
banana
with
a
kick
of
dry
alcohol
finishes
semidry
overall
great
session
beer
and
by
far
my
favorite
dubbel
that
i
have
had
to
date
awesome
beer
prost
new
belgium
is
such
a
great
brewery
yes
they
have
some
brews
that
dont
quite
satisfy
the
palate
but
for
me
most
do
and
this
blows
itself
out
of
the
water
if
you
like
the
style
you
will
love
this
brew
very
well
done
excellent
dubbel
i
really
do
like
this
one
completely
a
class
in
itself
compared
to
the
trippel
by
nb
which
is
ok
but
nothing
of
this
standard
this
is
an
alright
beer
for
the
style
the
yeast
is
a
bit
spicy
reminding
me
more
of
a
tripel
the
malt
character
is
a
bit
a
toasty
and
burnt
for
my
liking
i
will
probably
aim
for
something
a
bit
more
malty
and
less
yeasty
in
the
future
burgundy
color
with
a
decent
head
and
lace
nose
full
of
fruity
esters
bubblegum
sweet
malt
some
yeast
characer
medium
bodied
bubbly
fruity
sweet
but
not
overly
so
hints
of
caramel
banana
spices
slight
yeasty
dryness
in
finish
along
with
a
hint
of
sourness
very
drinkable
o
my
favorite
beer
from
new
belgiums
regular
lineup
very
tasty
and
complex
and
true
to
style
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
thicker
but
besides
that
great
beer
new
belgium
continues
to
deliver
in
their
explorer
line
of
beers
this
is
a
fairly
hearty
beer
and
could
work
well
with
the
right
dish
and
certainly
some
desserts
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
come
to
mind
o
a
nearly
perfect
beer
at
an
incredible
value
here
in
wichita
i
buy
6
packs
of
this
for
7
99
basically
unheard
of
when
the
product
is
this
wonderful
i
highly
recommend
picking
some
up
and
sampling
it
for
yourself
you
wont
regret
it
o
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
so
these
may
just
be
the
traits
of
the
style
i
find
this
beer
to
be
too
delicate
for
my
tastes
the
tastes
are
good
but
i
like
them
to
be
more
pronounced
so
i
had
to
grade
it
at
average
on
the
taste
however
this
beer
appeals
to
the
other
senses
very
well
d
id
definitely
have
this
again
its
high
quality
and
given
its
availability
and
price
point
itd
be
hard
to
beat
one
of
nbs
best
beers
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
and
a
good
value
for
the
money
but
could
use
some
more
flavor
in
my
opinion
one
of
new
belgiums
best
and
though
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
but
when
i
am
there
are
few
as
good
pours
amberruby
in
appearance
with
a
big
head
smells
malty
sweet
yeastya
touch
of
alcohol
flavor
is
really
sweet
hit
me
like
raisin
bubblegum
which
i
really
did
not
like
at
all
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
i
would
not
bother
with
this
one
again
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
if
for
no
other
reason
than
its
pricepoint
but
next
time
i
have
a
craving
for
an
american
abbey
style
ale
i
will
stick
with
ommegangs
reviewed
on

overall
disappointing
for
me
too
sweet
and
a
little
bit
light
in
the
flavour
department
not
to
say
that
it
is
a
bland
beer
it
clearly
is
not
but
i
dont
think
it
has
the
heft
that
really
good
dubbels
have
o
absolutely
wonderful
very
drinkable
smooth
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
i
really
enjoy
the
sweet
malts
and
clove
notes
i
will
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
hopefully
its
going
to
be
a
regular
at
growler
town
appears
mostly
dark
brown
in
color
but
has
reddish
highlights
around
the
edges
comes
equipped
with
a
nice
sand
colored
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
all
around
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
smells
mostly
of
lightly
clovespiced
bananas
and
caramel
malt
tastes
mostly
of
raisins
mixed
with
more
cloves
and
just
a
hint
of
figs
at
the
end
not
too
shabby
if
i
have
to
criticize
something
it
would
be
that
there
is
not
quite
enough
emphasis
on
yeastiness
spiciness
or
tangy
belgofunk
flavors
and
aromas
especially
compared
to
how
much
care
and
attention
all
the
other
aspects
of
this
brew
have
obviously
been
assembled
with
other
than
that
detail
this
brew
is
pretty
amazing
pours
a
transparent
redbrown
hue
head
is
almost
tan
at
the
pour
it
stands
about
12
inch
in
a
pint
glass
after
anout
a
minute
it
has
receeded
to
a

smell
is
of

esther
notes
taste
starts
sweet
then
i
get
some
of
those
belgian
yeast
notes
i
also
catch
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
alcohol
becomes
present
in
the
taste
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeel
is
heavy
slight
carbonation
overall
an
approachable
dubbel
i
think
this
is
spectacular
grocery
store
beer
especially
considering
price
i
think
this
will
be
worth
a
6
pack
this
winter
overall
i
guess
i
dont
match
others
on
this
it
was
ok
but
nothing
more
then
that
honestly
i
didnt
finish
it
oa
great
dubbel
for
the
price
im
glad
new
belgium
makes
this
beer
as
this
style
is
a
go
to
beer
during
the
nonsummer
months
not
as
good
as
some
other
more
expensive
dubbels
out
there
due
to
lesser
bodymouthfeel
and
stronger
alcohol
finish
but
a
really
nice
beer
to
drink
in
place
of
many
alternatives
another
solid
beer
from
new
belgiumwhat
a
great
brewery
notes
balanced
complex
and
full
of
flavor
this
is
one
awesome
american
take
on
a
dubbel
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
making
this
a
brew
that
is
dangerously
easy
to
drink
by
far
my
favorite
of
all
of
new
belgiums
everyday
releases
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
even
though
i
think
some
belgian
ones
are
definitely
better
i
think
this
style
seems
to
let
me
down
i
always
expect
it
to
be
extremely
flavorful
but
it
comes
across
more
watery
than
i
would
like
overall
i
like
it
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
but
a
decent
dubbel
and
so
far
my
favorite
offering
from
new
belgium
great
carbonation
and
mouthfeelimpressive
dubbel
especially
at
this
price
point
i
will
definitely
buy
again
o
a
really
nice
beer
with
good
belgian
character
just
more
belgianness
is
that
a
word
is
needed
to
crank
this
up
to
great
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
had
that
comes
in
a
six
pack
ive
always
felt
the
belgium
part
of
new
belgiums
name
left
a
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
because
theyve
never
really
demonstrated
their
proficiency
with
the
belgian
yeast
strain
well
this
along
with
their
tripel
shut
me
up
this
a
dubbel
that
stays
true
to
the
style
while
still
adding
its
own
flavor
its
probably
the
best
american
made
dubbel
and
it
brings
something
new
to
the
table
i
love
this
beer
and
the
bang
it
gives
you
for
the
buck
thank
you
nb
for
proving
you
can
be
creative
and
please
release
more
widely
accessible
great
beers
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
while
it
doesnt
try
to
claim
your
attention
by
doing
something
strange
it
does
catch
you
by
creating
a
well
balanced
beer
good
example
of
the
style
while
a
bit
on
the
light
side
its
still
a
really
nice
beer
nor
light
not
really
heavy
a
great
session
beer
for
a
great
price
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
its
a
refreshingly
light
yet
just
heavy
enough
beer
new
belgium
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
session
and
readily
available
and
amazing
prices
considering
how
great
it
is
i
will
be
buying
this
in
6
packs
with
some
frequency
luckily
here
in
colorado
its
so
easy
to
find
im
not
a
certified
beer
connoisseur
however
i
have
tried
many
brands
and
i
do
know
what
i
like
new
belgium
abbey
is
one
of
my
favorite
craft
beers
it
goes
well
with
foods
such
as
pasta
and
meat
the
subtle
caramel
chocolate
toffee
flavors
are
enjoyable
and
the
aftertaste
is
clean
and
satisfying
overall
a
very
good
craft
ale
oi
really
like
this
beer
after
one
im
left
with
a
very
balanced
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
on
my
pallet
after
a
second
i
feel
like
i
really
could
enjoy
it
on
a
regular
basis
overall
a
very
pleasant
tasting
dubbel
not
to
sweet
with
a
mild
alcohol
finish
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
very
well
balanced
brew
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
reminds
me
of
an
ommegang
abbey
ale
only
with
half
the
markup
follows
the
abbey
ale
styles
nicely
without
much
flaw
overall
a
well
brewed
enjoyable
beer
and
with
a
price
tag
of
only
8
something
per
six
pack
a
decently
priced
beer
too
definitely
a
new
frequent
buy
for
me
beer
is
thin
with
a
mild
roasty
ashy
finish
on
the
back
end
with
some
grain
bitterness
the
forward
and
late
midpalate
are
cidery
with
a
mild
apply
sweetness
overall
the
beer
is
decent
but
not
great
id
have
it
again
but
the
flavor
is
the
most
disappointing
this
about
this
lose
the
ashy
finish
and
you
have
a
really
nice
dubbel
here
o
a
very
good
brew
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
dangerously
drinkable
but
i
never
really
could
fault
a
beer
for
that
real
happy
with
this
one
new
belgium
is
really
impressing
me
might
need
to
move
to
a
state
in
which
they
distribute
can
i
have
another
overall
this
is
the
best
session
beer
to
me
i
love
to
buy
this
or
the
trippel
from
new
belgium
just
an
all
around
solid
beer
a
high
quality
beer
i
am
normally
not
a
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
but
i
was
given
this
by
a
connoisseur
friend
of
mine
and
i
greatly
enjoyed
it
goes
down
well
good
strong
taste
and
no
bad
after
taste
one
of
the
better
beers
that
i
have
had
in
a
while
now
i
just
hope
that
they
will
start
shipping
this
further
east
so
i
dont
have
to
drive
all
the
way
to
chicago
to
get
it
overall
nice
brew
sweet
and
fruity
just
mildly
bitter
not
sure
if
id
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
day
but
its
a
good
savory
brew
this
is
a
good
widely
available
starter
beer
for
the
style
the
finest
of
the
conventional
new
belgium
offerings
in
my
opinion
pours
a
dark
brown
darker
than
i
was
anticipating
with
a
fluffy
white
head
an
inch
or
so
think
smell
is
malt
and
alcohol
with
that
belgian
yeast
present
and
some
clear
bananna
vibes
happening
notes
of
toffee
and
subtle
roasted
nuts
in
the
taste
with
a
faintly
spiced
finish
a
very
quaffable
brew
for
7
percent
abv
bravo
o
3
75
nice
flavor
profile
but
nonetheless
seems
like
a
clear
step
down
when
sampled
soon
after
enjoying
one
of
the
great
true
belgians
improves
with
warming
mandatory
and
aging
overall
extremely
balanced
and
well
crafted
beer
a
very
delicious
beer
that
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
oits
good
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
you
can
get
one
a
pretty
good
value
at
ten
dollars
for
a
sixer
m
thintomedium
body
quite
dry
and
crisp
has
a
clean
but
slightly
sweet
finish
abbey
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
almost
a
purple
with
a
little
bit
of
a
lacing
head
the
smell
is
very
full
sweet
a
tad
malty
but
a
strong
grape
almost
wine
like
aroma
the
taste
is
on
the
maltier
side
deffently
sweet
a
nice
grape
like
flavor
that
is
very
balanced
good
strong
flavor
a
bit
warming
too
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
dubbel
its
almost
like
a
barley
wine
but
still
its
disticnalty
not
i
wasnt
expected
that
much
out
of
this
beer
deffently
surprised
me
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
but
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
new
belgium
so
no
surprise
there
o
id
recommend
this
to
people
that
want
to
try
belgian
style
beers
without
having
to
pay
as
much
for
the
real
deal
from
across
the
pond
good
rendition
of
a
great
style
this
is
a
pretty
decent
drink
for
the
price
actually
quite
easy
to
drink
im
half
way
through
the
six
packnot
all
today
this
abbey
poured
in
to
a
snifter
pours
a
clear
very
deep
redbrown
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
that
quickly
diminished
to
a
thin
skim
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
lots
of
dark
fruits
raisin
figs
and
cherries
along
side
the
dark
fruits
are
spicy
peppery
phenols
nice
the
flavor
is
a
nice
blend
of
spicy
phenols
and
cherry
raisinlike
dark
malts
the
beer
finishes
rather
dry
with
some
lingering
malt
and
definite
spicy
yeast
character
delicious
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
mediumhigh
overall
a
very
flavorful
well
crafted
dubbel
recommend
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
dark
barely
transparent
honey
brown
with
a
thick
pale
tan
head
rich
aroma
fills
the
snout
with
earthy
malty
and
grassy
tones
earthy
malty
flavor
has
a
nice
alcohol
bite
and
nutty
and
caramel
hints
texture
is
fizzy
and
fullbodied
leaving
a
tingly
and
earthy
finish
a
good
one
o
this
is
fast
becoming
one
of
my
staples
this
is
a
great
tasting
versatile
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
without
losing
my
taste
for
it
or
i
could
drink
one
in
a
night
and
be
perfectly
satisfied
having
not
really
delved
into
the
new
belgium
lineup
this
one
will
certainly
encourage
me
to
try
a
few
more
d
decent
i
went
in
highly
skeptical
given
the
shoes
it
had
to
fill
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
drinkability
things
i
didnt
like
were
the
fartoothin
body
the
nail
polish
and
the
headlessness
not
much
hop
presence
but
thats
to
be
expected
one
of
the
probably
no
doubt
the
best
outside
trappist
ales
the
best
abbey
ale
of
all
time
and
i
mean
that
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
didnt
think
new
belgium
brewery
was
capable
of
producing
a
true
belgian
style
ale
fat
tire
hoptober
etc
but
this
beer
lives
up
to
expectations
t
very
grainy
taste
up
front
quite
sweet
as
well
taste
is
unique
and
has
a
lot
to
offer
even
tasted
some
banana
in
there
this
is
an
ale
that
can
be
sipped
very
slowly
over
a
long
period
of
time
so
that
you
can
enjoy
the
lingering
aftertaste
or
it
can
be
drunk
at
a
normal
pace
to
enjoy
the
intricate
mix
of
malts
and
hops
this
ale
seems
to
be
the
perfect
compromise
between
price
and
quality
at
around
1
50
a
bottle
from
the
store
it
packs
an
enormous
amount
of
drinkability
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
wished
that
it
came
in
bottles
smaller
than
12
ounces
like
a
good
port
i
find
that
even
a
small
quantity
can
be
highly
satisfying
a
very
good
american
take
on
the
dubbel
i
would
probably
give
the
nod
to
chimay
or
st
bernardus
but
this
is
still
a
quality
brew
a
fairly
nice
pour
with
a
nice
dark
chestnut
color
with
good
clarity
a
decent
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
some
banana
clove
and
bubblegum
in
the
nose
but
there
is
also
a
tout
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
that
interferes
a
bit
with
the
other
lovely
aromas
the
taste
is
more
integrated
and
lacks
that
alcohol
heat
but
does
pick
up
some
breadiness
along
with
the
banana
clove
and
bubblegum
full
in
the
mouth
and
a
bit
thick
but
overall
a
very
nice
beer
o
it
isnt
very
complex
but
it
tastes
okay
total
3950
excellent
example
of
style
o
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
a
good
brew
and
nice
rendition
of
the
style
o
pretty
good
dubbel
brewed
in
the
us
easy
drinking
with
no
sign
of
alcohol
delicious
and
enjoyable
another
winner
from
new
belgium
not
the
best
belgian
style
ale
by
any
means
but
definitely
among
the
better
ones
brewed
this
side
of
the
atlantic
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
i
would
seek
this
out
again
o
this
is
a
tasty
beer
complex
aromas
and
flavors
and
the
reasonable
price
will
probably
lead
me
to
buy
this
again
sometime
the
light
body
and
spicy
dryness
make
this
one
easytodrink
brew
perhaps
less
complex
than
some
of
the
originals
from
the
continent
as
well
as
some
originating
here
in
the
states
a
bit
of
bottleconditioning
would
also
be
welcome
though
not
really
necessary
to
make
it
enjoyable
an
easydrinking
interpretation
of
the
style
with
a
wellhidden
alcohol
content
that
keeps
it
accessible
yet
enjoyable
o
alright
definitely
not
my
go
to
but
im
at
my
dads
and
here
it
is
either
this
or
old
raspy
given
the
95
degree
heat
ill
go
with
this
and
save
the
raspy
for
later
or
at
all
good
brew
and
solid
representation
of
the
style
by
the
colorodians
well
done
drink
it
monks
this
is
definitly
a
great
step
in
for
a
person
tring
dubbles
but
doesnt
want
to
break
the
bank
rich
caramel
and
cocoa
aroma
with
a
light
and
suttle
sweetness
deep
amber
almost
copper
color
nice
creamy
head
and
a
great
and
delicate
finish
and
unlike
many
other
dubbles
not
that
filling
pours
translucent
light
golden
brown
with
rich
creamy
tan
head
persisting
relatively
long
with
residual
lacing
a
bit
peppery
pungent
aroma
when
opened
no
noticable
hoppiness
this
brief
odor
must
have
been
due
to
the
type
of
yeast
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
an
ale
at
all
the
taste
was
softer
biscuity
slightly
sweet
not
malty
at
all
in
the
sense
of
stout
and
absolutely
none
of
the
citrus
frequent
in
hefweizens
but
very
smooth
and
creamy
due
to
the
persistent
foaminess
with
lightly
spiceyness
a
bit
similar
to
mothership
witbeer
but
none
of
the
fruitiness
of
some
hefweizens
perhaps
a
little
banana
esther
detectable
a
sweeter
moderate
weight
savorable
beer
much
better
than
i
expected
compared
to
some
light
mineral
british
ales
probably
comparable
to
an
imperial
ale
and
desireable
now
that
the
prices
of
those
have
risen
tasty
beer
o
nothing
special
a
decent
effort
that
ultimately
falls
far
short
of
its
belgian
brethren
drinkable
but
not
recommended
o
ive
only
had
this
one
a
few
times
and
i
probably
should
drink
it
more
its
very
available
to
me
and
is
at
a
reasonable
price
overall
this
is
the
best
new
belgium
ive
had
so
far
highly
recommended
o
great
beer
and
good
example
of
belgian
dubbel
alcohol
is
masked
which
could
lead
to
a
dangerous
time
if
consuming
a
few
of
these
guys
having
it
as
a
summer
sipper
good
times
o
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
though
still
enjoyable
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
also
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
the
usual
overwhelming
yeast
and
sweet
characteristics
in
many
dubbels
is
balanced
very
well
in
this
by
some
much
welcomed
nutty
and
bready
malt
profile
my
burps
now
smell
like
yeast
o
its
a
really
good
brew
and
nice
to
be
able
to
pick
up
something
of
this
quality
so
readily
i
often
seek
it
out
in
stores
with
lesser
selection
very
solid
beer
from
new
belgium
there
are
some
very
intriguing
notes
to
it
that
keep
me
going
back
to
the
glass
sip
after
sip
its
very
complex
for
a
dubbel
most
enjoyable
pours
a
glorious
deep
garnettinged
amber
color
with
a
thick
creamy
sticky
creamcolored
head
on
top
the
aroma
primarily
features
a
yeasty
earthiness
but
there
is
also
a
dull
musty
hop
presence
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
the
flavor
is
satisfying
but
muddled
with
a
primary
characteristic
of
caramelized
bananas
along
with
a
bid
of
earthiness
and
a
faint
sugary
sweetness
the
microfine
carbonation
is
a
bit
prickly
but
the
overall
texture
is
actually
quite
creamy
overall
this
beer
cant
quite
stand
up
to
the
depth
and
complexity
of
the
heavyweights
of
the
style
but
it
is
still
a
smooth
and
flavorful
dubbel
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
12oz
bottle
poured
into
an
ommegang
goblet
pours
a
chestnut
brown
with
some
ruby
hues
and
it
looks
a
bit
murky
capped
with
some
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
and
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
very
strong
with
a
bit
of
a
burnt
malt
leading
the
way
belgian
yeast
spice
raisins
and
banana
perhaps
a
bit
more
burnt
than
i
would
like
but
nice
taste
is
also
strong
with
similar
notes
to
the
aroma
but
the
burntness
is
toned
down
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
spot
on
with
ample
carbonation
a
nice
easy
drinking
dubbel
o
d
yeah
this
is
pretty
good
it
just
doesnt
seem
properly
belgian
overall
dubbel
perfection
no
but
its
certainly
one
of
the
better
americanborn
dubbels
available
and
has
been
for
quite
some
time
taste
yeast
is
present
but
thankfully
not
as
dominant
as
it
is
in
the
aroma
dry
and
creamy
and
finishes
dry
not
what
i
hooped
for
my
200
beer
on
beeradvocate
poured
a
mostly
clear
red
color
with
a
fairly
thin
cream
colored
head
glorious
smells
of
dark
fruit
clove
belgian
yeast
and
bananas
woahh
malty
flavor
is
dominated
by
malt
raisins
fruit
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
certainly
tastes
like
an
abbey
but
this
is
on
the
verge
of
cloyingly
sweet
feel
is
moderate
a
slightly
better
than
average
attempt
mouthfeel
is
light
very
easy
to
drink
goes
down
w
no
problem
after
pouring
the
rest
of
the
beer
into
the
glass
it
is
apparent
that
this
is
a
very
carbonated
beer
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
its
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
it
does
seem
to
be
appropriate
for
the
style
sweeter
than
some
of
the
other
dubbels
ive
had
a
good
americanbrewed
abbey
dubbel
particularly
for
the
price
and
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
a
6pack
not
the
biggest
fan
of
bubblegumforward
beers
so
ill
probably
be
skipping
past
this
for
ommegangs
abbey
ale
in
the
future
this
is
a
seriously
enjoyable
dubbel
though
its
very
sweet
with
the
fruity
esters
and
belgian
yeast
dominating
that
said
one
of
the
better
american
made
dubbels
i
can
remember
recently
do
right
before
i
popped
this
one
i
had
second
thoughts
on
putting
it
back
in
the
fridge
to
save
for
another
night
in
the
far
off
future
im
glad
i
didnt
while
im
not
sure
i
will
go
out
and
buy
a
bunch
more
of
this
sooo
many
other
beers
to
try
i
will
mark
it
down
as
one
i
very
much
enjoyed
and
will
be
sure
to
have
down
the
line
somewhere
hats
off
new
belgium
ive
been
going
off
nb
for
a
while
notable
exceptions
include
some
of
their
lips
of
faith
collection
but
this
offering
is
going
to
keep
me
interested
for
some
time
if
they
distribute
their
abbey
grand
cru
in
georgia
id
love
to
sample
it
at
9
for
a
six
pack
id
definitely
pick
this
up
again
as
a
regular
bevy
d
overall
a
well
done
beer
drinkable
a
good
dubbel
is
i
feel
pretty
tough
to
pull
off
this
one
is
enjoyable
enough
but
doesnt
necessarily
stand
out
in
any
way
i
wont
pass
this
one
up
again
blended
terrificly
with
some
sharp
cheddar
wheat
crackers
and
a
spicy
mustard
with
horseradish
d
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
it
would
be
a
superb
session
beer
if
not
for
sheer
price
that
comes
with
the
territory
of
microbrews
though
good
thing
i
have
a
six
pafive
pack
this
confers
with
other
new
belgium
brews
ive
had
enjoyable
and
technically
correct
but
a
bit
mechanical
and
lacking
in
heart
and
soul
this
is
the
random
beer
chosen
to
see
the
finish
to
mlbs
opening
day
it
pours
a
clear
ruby
brown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirtycream
foam
the
nose
comprises
raisins
nutmeg
dark
wheat
cinnamon
belgian
yeast
clove
fig
and
a
few
drops
of
light
maple
syrup
the
taste
follows
pretty
closely
with
the
additions
of
black
pepper
red
grapes
very
red
winey
thing
goin
on
here
and
a
touch
of
darklytoasted
rye
bread
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
dubbel
though
it
doesnt
warm
all
too
well
so
long
as
the
temperature
is
controlled
this
aint
too
bad
at
all
poured
an
amber
brown
into
a
chalice
smells
sweet
and
malty
unfortunately
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
people
gave
it
its
sweet
and
malty
up
front
with
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
a
not
a
really
good
beer
it
tastes
like
you
took
a
good
dubbel
and
added
water
to
make
it
drinkable
disapointed
overall
drinkability
great
beer
good
breakfast
beer
for
a
hot
morning
overall
fat
tires
best
the
aromas
of
dark
fruit
were
first
and
foremost
in
this
brew
raisin
and
figs
came
to
mind
as
i
inhaled
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
towards
the
sweet
side
i
expect
the
few
years
of
age
might
have
something
to
do
with
that
it
had
a
medium
feel
in
the
mouth
with
good
carbonation
all
around
this
was
a
nice
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
brewed
in
the
states
the
yeast
strain
was
spot
on
for
me
and
it
was
well
worth
the
try
overall
not
bad
herbal
hops
are
meh
malts
are
nice
decent
beer
d
nice
and
tasty
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
nbb
clean
tasty
and
very
repeatable
clear
like
crystal
clarity
sunburst
gibson
guitar
in
color
wall
of
lacing
looks
perfect
in
my
goose
island
glass
aroma
gives
off
a
generous
amount
of
spices
along
with
yeast
and
bananas
flavors
are
packed
of
bright
and
zesty
spices
and
a
platter
full
of
assorted
fruits
i
am
enjoying
this
one
and
the
price
makes
it
a
no
brainer
for
its
style
great
buy
d
this
is
a
great
brew
one
of
my
favorites
from
new
belgium
i
feel
it
would
be
more
fitting
to
call
this
a
dunkel
than
a
belgian
abbey
ale
i
dont
think
id
purchase
this
beer
but
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
the
flavor
improves
noticeably
when
warming
a
rich
flavorful
brew
likely
nbs
best
sweet
tasty
even
keeled
pretty
and
completely
unexpected
surely
this
beer
makes
me
respect
new
belgium
more
than
any
of
their
offerings
have
ever
made
me
do
so
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
a
chance
at
having
off
flavors
and
spices
this
is
very
drinkable
the
beer
is
a
very
handsome
deep
garnet
color
crystal
clear
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
laces
a
bit
on
the
way
down
strong
scent
of
banana
the
taste
is
fruity
and
malty
theres
a
touch
of
dryness
from
roasted
malts
which
is
a
little
dissapointing
i
dont
think
those
belong
in
abbey
style
beers
still
this
is
an
easy
to
find
and
very
enjoyable
abbey
style
beer
from
a
domestic
brewer
whats
not
to
love
about
that
geef

abbey
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
deep
amberred
color
very
thin
head
that
disappeared
quickly
smells
hit
me
as
soon
as
i
started
the
pour
sugary
toffee
and
banana
jump
out
reminds
me
of
a
good
sticky
bread
pudding
taste
follows
the
line
started
by
the
aroma
just
a
little
bitterness
up
front
but
then
the
sweetness
sets
in
quickly
toffee
with
an
almost
rum
like
molasses
being
most
prevelent
just
barely
taste
and
feel
the
alcholol
as
well
that
surprised
me
a
bit
at
7
i
figured
it
would
be
hidden
fairly
well
pleasant
mouthfeell
as
well
nice
carbonation
up
front
with
a
nice
smoothness
without
being
heavy
could
see
having
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
beyond
that
the
sweetness
might
become
a
bit
much
d
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
interpretation
of
the
style
it
had
exceptional
appearance
and
smell
it
had
betterthangood
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
it
had
good
taste
like
i
said
smokey
and
delicious
for
my
first
review
i
decided
to
do
my
beer
of
choice
this
winter
nbs
abbey
is
a
sleeper
hit
for
me
it
pours
into
a
leather
brown
with
two
fingers
of
a
tan
head
it
smells
of
holiday
spice
at
first
tasting
are
hints
of
bananas
paired
with
these
spices
this
beer
is
great
for
a
sipper
or
knocking
back
5
or
6
mad
props
to
nb
this
is
the
beer
that
opened
my
eyes
to
the
craft
pours
transparent
brown
with
generous
thick
head
nose
is
very
aromatic
of
brown
sugar
bubble
gum
in
a
good
way
fresh
brown
breads
and
yeasty
esters
extremely
appetizing
before
the
taste
on
the
palate
is
a
complex
spice
dark
roasty
sweet
flavors
again
with
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
a
good
bubble
gum
component
finish
is
medium
with
more
malt
sweetness
fresh
breadiness
and
leaves
with
a
teasing
note
that
makes
you
want
another
sip
very
good
d
very
nice
drinkability
some
alchohol
taste
but
a
bit
sneaky
different
from
other
beers
in
this
class
but
quite
enjoyable
amazing
what
those
monks
in
belgium
came
up
with
my
first
intro
to
belgian
style
ales
was
leffe
brune
in
brussels
what
an
experience
amazing
richness
in
a
glass
the
new
belgium
abbey
ale
is
the
most
accessible
us
brew
to
recreate
that
experience
it
is
my
standard
dessert
beer
literally
when
i
skip
the
chocolate
cake
i
treat
myself
by
pulling
out
the
leffe
glass
i
brought
back
from
belgium
and
pour
in
the
deep
dark
elixir
brewed
in
ft
collins
it
has
a
wonderful
malty
aroma
and
superior
head
the
flavor
is
a
deep
malty
sweetness
to
be
savored
slowly
there
is
a
touch
of
bitter
that
adds
complexity
to
the
mix
not
your
every
day
beer
but
a
wonderful
treat
when
a
treat
is
in
order
a
deliciously
drinkable
treat
thats
going
to
be
repeated
for
sure
drinkability
awesome
beer
from
new
belgium
they
have
always
had
great
beers
but
this
one
really
put
them
out
there
as
an
a
for
me
one
of
the
best
dubbels
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
d
dangerously
easydrinking
d
good
but
abv
will
impede
a
session
for
sure
still
quite
delicious
d
i
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
on
nice
winter
nights
and
it
so
readily
available
which
makes
it
great
for
anytime
makes
me
think
of
rochefort
meets
fat
tire
i
like
it
the
body
is
a
bit
sweet
but
isnt
full
bodied
overall
i
would
like
more
estersphenols
but
an
easy
drinking
beer
overall
a
really
good
dubbel
that
i
highly
recommend
one
of
the
best
american
versions
out
there
avail
here
in
tx
rotation
in
more
of
a
hop
bomb
mode
this
days
but
this
one
deserves
a
couple
a
year
for
sure
oy
picked
up
in
a
mixed
six
poured
from
the
bottle
a
medium
hazy
brown
with
a
good
rocky
offwhite
head
aromas
of
light
toffee
brown
spices
and
belgian
yeast
medium
bodied
spicy
and
wellcarbonated
flavors
of
light
brown
sugar
bubble
gum
yeast
and
cardamom
d
not
as
heavy
as
some
dubbels
very
easy
drinking
d
im
really
disappointed
in
this
my
friend
had
this
a
few
weeks
ago
and
loved
it
i
also
see
i
am
in
the
minority
among
my
fellow
bas
again
i
hope
this
is
a
bad
batch
as
it
wasnt
easy
to
finish
d
the
yeast
character
is
very
nice
and
it
blends
with
the
malt
flavors
and
dried
fruit
there
is
some
very
nice
depth
but
it
is
subtle
and
flows
together
d
not
very
complex
but
a
very
good
session
beer
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
i
get
a
lot
of
cherry
and
candy
sugar
notes
as
well
as
some
toffee
belgian
yeast
and
chocolate
notes
the
chocolate
is
faint
and
is
only
present
occasionally
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
toffee
and
dark
fruit
the
cocoa
is
also
more
present
in
the
flavor
than
it
was
in
the
aroma
the
beer
is
a
lot
drier
than
i
expected
and
i
think
this
is
a
little
bit
of
a
turn
off
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
americanmade
dubbel
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
new
belgium
drinkability
this
is
a
really
nice
dubbel
from
new
belgium
i
feel
like
ive
been
hitting
spot
on
beer
after
spot
on
beer
with
new
belgium
lately
i
could
definitely
go
for
another
one
of
these
but
alas
this
was
my
only
bottle
d
very
drinkable
definitely
one
of
the
more
approachable
representatives
of
this
style
d
drinkability
is
high
flavors
are
bold
and
enjoyable
no
sign
of
alcohol
and
a
great
mouthfeel
all
help
compensate
for
a
relatively
lacking
pour
great
beer
d
simple

unimpressive
overallnotes
tonight
i
drank
this
and
watched
the
snow
fall
outside
it
was
kind
of
a
cool
experience
this
is
a
very
good
brew
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
it
out
if
its
in
your
area
another
good
job

very

i
like
this
beer
realistically
there
are
much
better
representations
of
this
style
while
i
wont
say
ill
never
buy
this
one
again
i
also
wont
commit
to
buying
it
again
nice
taste
fruity
apples
pears
just
not
up
to
what
i
want
from
a
dubbel
good
beer
though
overall
a
very
yeasty
and
thin
tasting
dubbel
i
personally
like
a
little
more
malt
sweetness
and
a
fuller
body
this
is
one
of
new
belgiums
heavier
tasting
beers
it
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
long
lasting
head
as
you
take
in
a
slight
scent
of
malts
it
is
very
rich
in
flavor
that
is
also
slightly
bitter
its
fairly
strong
taste
makes
this
a
good
sipping
beer
final
notes
this
is
a
banana
lovers
beer
lots
of
delicious
ripe
banana
flavor
to
go
around
with
other
flavors
to
balance
it
out
its
sweetness
would
lend
it
well
to
pair
with
many
desserts
drinkability
8
sixer
7abv
with
good
flavors
seems
like
a
no
brainer
to
me
it
tastes
like
bubblegum
it
has
solid
belgianstyle
flavors
otherwise
but
the
overpowering
bubblegum
flavor
is
sickening
i
wish
i
had
more
to
say
about
this
beer
but
all
that
really
matters
to
me
is
that
it
has
a
bubblegum
flavor
and
thats
never
what
im
going
to
want
in
a
beer
the
finish
is
nice
and
fairly
clean
it
will
go
well
with
a
cheese
or
a
creamy
soup
not
a
bad
thing
to
have
in
the
fridge
but
im
really
more
of
a
sucker
for
the
belgian
or
trappist
versions
ive
had
this
is
likely
to
be
my
replacement
for
my
favorite
new
glarus
year
round
beer
stone
soup
that
theyre
discontinuing
next
year
its
a
little
richer
than
the
ng
beer
and
has
more
alcohol
but
its
otherwise
a
good
matchup
and
should
pair
well
with
virtually
any
food
overall
a
very
nice
beer
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
d
this
was
a
surprise
for
me
from
nb
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
not
the
greatest
abbey
ale
i
have
had
but
still
not
the
worst
alcohol
was
pretty
well
hidden
from
the
front
of
the
beer
i
would
buy
this
one
again
and
drink
it
if
given
to
me
d
this
suffers
for
two
reasons
there
is
a
slight
booze
taste
mixed
within
the
sweetness
and
the
cloves
are
very
strong
this
beer
taste
beautiful
and
complex
i
hate
knocking
it
down
but
we
loved
it
so
much
it
was
our
pick
to
buy
a
case
if
you
drink
one
it
is
an
a
but
if
you
try
to
drink
it
as
a
goto
ie
buy
a
case
it
gets
more
difficult
to
down
too
spicy
to
drink
more
than
three
also
a
bit
too
strong
the
aroma
of
this
beer
smells
what
you
would
expect
from

style
ale
has
a
very
belgian
aroma
to
it
the
head
was
white
which
didnt
last
very
long
may
be
an
unclean

definetly
taste
the
belgian
candi
sugar
it
is
a
very
sweet
tasting
beer
ends
with
a
fizzy
almost
burning
carbonation
which
can
be
expected
from
this
style
there
is
a
hint
of
roasted
almost
burnt
flavor
which
is
probably
from
the
chocolate
malt
that
is
used
or
possibly
from
some
of
the
caramel

malt
all
in
all
a
good
abbey
style
ale
pours
an

with
a
light
tan
head
good

brings
forward
some
spice
with
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
bread
taste
brings
some
fairly
strong
yeast
characteristics
to
the
front
with
some
dates
and
raisins
slight
alcohol
presence
good
body
with
a
bit
of
heat
drinks
fairly
well
fresh
but
could
probably
use
some
time
a
very
nice
rounded
and
enjoyable
dubbel
the
booze
certainly
doesnt
show
in
any
real
way
making
this
a
decidedly
easy
drinker
if
thats
your
thing
a
solid
offering
from
new
belgium
this
one
is
almost
always
in
the
fridge
at
the
inlaws
and
a
very
good
go
to
beer
for
sure
drinkability
high
not
as
good
as
most
dubbels
i
have
had
maybe
it
needed
more
time
in
the
bottle
as
this
was
a
very
fresh
dated
bottle
d
not
a
bad
beer
good
enough
ill
drink
the
rest
of
the
sixer
im
glad
they
threw
in
the

not
sure
how
it
would
have
tasted
without
it
d
incredible
drinkability
considering
how
much
is
going

with
every
satisfying
sip
we
really
like
the

explore

abbey
was
a
very
tasty
dubel
surprising
drinkability
for
a
belgian
style
ale
an
exceptional
american
dubbel
in
the
trappist
ale
tradition
d
i
would
have
no
problem
knocking
down
a
few
of
these
if
i
enjoyed
the
taste
more
im
not
an
expert
in
belgian
style
ales
but
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
hefeweizen
thats
been
skunked
has
way
too
much
banana
or
was
otherwise
mishandled
however
if
you
remove
the
banana
aspects
by
switching
yeasts
to
a
more
standard
ale
yeast
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
belgian
its
on
the
malty
side
but
with
a
balanced
hop
presence
if
you
like
banana
youll
love
this
one
its
just
not
for
me
wont
finish
the
6
pack
its
going
on
my
i
need
to
offer
a
beer
to
someone
to
be
polite
but
i
really
dont
know
if
youre
worth
a
good
beer

have

in

right
next

bluemoonswoondec

jbogan
though
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
its
still
pretty
drinkable
if
mildly
underwhelming
d
this
is
a
decent
dubbel
but
perhaps
not
the
best
example
it
lacks
some
depth
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
introductory
belgian
style
beers
nb
gets
a
lot
of
flack
for
its
flagship
beer
but
abbey
ale
is
quite
a
gem
that
seems
to
get
forgotten
perhaps
this
is
due
to
its
limited
distribution
but
im
glad
to
say
i
am
able
to
purchase
it
again
since
my
move
from
mo
to
il
the
drinkability
factor
is
dangerous
as
the
7
is
hard
to
detect
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
fresh
head
and
lacing
smells
of
apples
and
pears
and
melons
with
hops
and
malts
the
taste
is
of
typical
dubbel
with
the
proprietary
yeast
from
nb
that
we
all
know
this
one
has
the
bananasclove
coriander
and
yeast
strains
but
it
is
thin
on
all
fronts
and
just
average
it
is
fruitier
interpretation
of
the
style
but
with
a
nice
maltiness
that
doesnt
become
too
sweet
drinkability
most
dubbels
do
not
taste
good
to
me
since
my
taste
buds
have
not
learned
to
enjoy
astringentharsh
flavor
so
i
will
rate
this
one
high
because
it
has
a
mild
flavor
and
tastes
good
there
is
a
dubbel
for
everyone
even
me
its
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
for
the
style
not
sure
if
this
is
really
a
dubbel
more
like
a
single
soft
and
creamy
offsets
the
slight
wateriness
but
a
nice
beer
at
this
abv
very
drinkable
sippable
nothing
wrong
here
just
maybe
a
better
fit
as
a
belgian
middark
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
an
off
white
two
finger
head
which
leaves
a
nice
sticky
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
bananas
pears
apples
and
phenols
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
and
is
lightly
sweet
medium
bodied
with
high
tingly
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
d
i
really
like
this
beer
highly
drinkable
there
are
so
many
good
qualities
to
this
beer
did
i
mention
that
i
was
distracted
by
the
banana
too
bad
cuz
the
rest
of
the
package
is
good
good
representation
of
a
dubbel
very
tasty
and
definately
repeatable
drinkability
yes
very
easy
drinking
with
a
moderate
abv
so
this
one
is
very
easy
to
session
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
a
nice
american
interpretation
of
the
belgian
dubbel
style
god
its
great
to
be
in
a
state
home
to
brewers
like
new
belgium
that
can
produce
fine
brews
that
are
fitting
to
its
name
sake
colorado
love
i
usually
dont
like
the
banana
flavors
associated
with
some
belgian
yeast
strains
however
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
the
bread
nuts
and
clove
flavors
keep
everything
balanced
and
in
check
definitely
not
a
bad
brew
d
not
too
bad
but
the
taste
just
keeps
throwing
me
off
this
isnt
tasting
like
the
average
dubbel
but
my
throat
is
a
little
soar
so
that
could
be
it
d
excellent
a
truely
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
most
anytime
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
be
quite
content
for
the
night
a
fine
entry
from
new
belgium
this
would
be
insane
with
grilled
red
meat
nice
charred
lamb
i
want
more
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
dubbels
i
have
had
however
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
dunkelweisse
still
pretty
drinkable
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
beer
is
a
deep
rubycrimson
color
with
a
thin
dissipating
head
the
smell
is
a
fruit
bouquet
a
sweet
malty
backbone
slightly
biscuity
mixed
with
tropical
punch
the
fruitiness
is
still
present
in
the
taste
but
takes
on
more
of
a
malty
licorice
flavor
rather
than
the
fruit
punch
in
the
nose
no
pun
intended
no
real
hops
to
speak
of
this
one
is
slightly
sweet
from
start
to
finish
the
alcohol
is
covered
well
only
a
slight
mouth
warming
sensation
is
present
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
mild
yet
active
carbonation
that
feels
heavy
on
the
tongue
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
fine
job
by
new
belgium
this
is
a
very
solid
dubbel
nice
aroma
and
quite
tasty
however
and
a
solid
brew
that
id
certainly
have
again
d
i
nice
belgian
true
to
form
and
tasty
overall
if
looking
for
a
strong
american
example
of
a
classic
belgian
style
youve
found
it
drinkability
this
one
went
down
quick
and
easy
compared
to
some
other
dubbles
very
tasty
beer
worth
trying
and
having
a
few
bottles
in
one
sitting
worked
for
me
great
beer
new
belgium
brewery
is
a
great
stop
anytime
you
are
in
fort
collins
co
d
definitely
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
probably
my
second
favorite
nb
brew
a
really
good
drinker
and
genuinely
enjoyable
overall
the
beer
was
pretty
good
i
easily
and
happily
fought
past
my
cinnamon
aversion
to
drink
this
tasty
brew
i
couldnt
have
many
of
these
at
any
one
sitting
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
push
it
away
if
an
unsolicited
abbey
came
my
way
lighter
than
most
dubbels
but
not
in
a
bad
way
at
all
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
a
quality
take
on
the
style
from
a
solid
brewery
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
steady
carbonation
goes
down
smoothly
enough
and
is
pretty
drinkable
a
little
on
the
mellow
side
but
overall
a
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
other
than
the
1554
which
is
also
somewhat
thin
and
maybe
the
mothership
wit
i
may
be
done
with
new
belgium
they
are
not
bad
beers
by
any
means
i
can
just
get
much
better
in
the
same
styles
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
chimay
goblet
this
ale
appears
a
medium
amber
chestnut
color
with
an
inch
of
lingering
ecru
foam
aromas
and
flavors
are
of
sweet
floral
fruits
caramelized
bananas
apples
dates
candi
spicy

approaching
full

and
certainly
amply
carbonated
great
stuff
quite

easy
i
could
have
a
bunch
of
these
had
this
sucker
in
the
fridge
for
a
while
now
why
not
poured
inta
my
pint
nice
caramel
color
with
a
red
tinge
head
was
moderately
frothy
about
a
two
fingers
with
some
lacing
kind
of
fruity
on
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
spice
not
as
full
as
i
would
expect
a
dubbel
to
be
fairy
mediocre
super
freaking
sweet
but
enjoyable
with
a
fruity
uber
sweet
deviation
of
that
belgian
yeasty
taste
up
front
sweet
malts
in
the
after
taste
overall
its
ok
thats
about
it
mine
slid
down
the
hatch
pretty
easily
but
definitely
not
something
to
lose
sleep
over
overall
really
good
drinkability
the
flavors
are
a
little
light
for
an
abbey
but
really
good
the
sweet
fruity
and
nutty
flavors
combine
nicely
very
good
beer
overpowering
sugary
taste
hurts
it
a
bit
but
hey
there
are
worse
things
you
can
say
about
a
beer
amber
in
color
with
red
edges
the
tan
head
fills
the
goblet
thin
but
sizeable
a
stripe
of
slightly
broken
lace
runs
around
the
glass
smell
is
thick
with
malts
which
are
topped
off
with
extra
ripe
bananas
and
oranges
some
phenolic
activity
exists
toward
the
very
end
taste
fruity
up
front
with
an
undercurrent
of
sweet
malts
and
taffy
leaving
everything
creamy
and
silky
going
down
very
nice
a
bit
innocuous
but
in
no
way
disappointing
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
double
maybe
not
as
spicy
or
earth
as
some
but
still
has
some
good
qualities
a
very
strong
brew
from
new
belgium
quite
impressive
im
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
instead
of
a
couple
of
singles
at
trader
joes
medium
body
but
it
drinks
lighter
than
that
refreshing
and
flavorful
this
is
a
nice
yearround
beer
d
this
ale
would
go
great
with
a
meal
its
complexity
would
only
complement
a
myriad
of
foods
as
heavy
as
it
is
i
would
not
sit
and
drink
more
than
one
in
a
session
a
beer
to
respect
and
savor
d

very

this

the
taste
again

ive
had

garbage
would
be
a
good
way
to
describe
it

pleasant
and
very
drinkable
dubbel
from
nb
drink
by
date
was
aug
2009
pours
a
crimson
red
almost
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fell
quickly
only
leaving
behind
some
splotchy
lacing
lots
of
fine
sediment
floating
around
and
plenty
of
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
is
sweet
fruity
spicy
yeasty
and
grassy
some
banana
aand
clove
are
present
in
the
nose
and
smells
almost
like
sugary
dark
belgian
wit
with
hints
of
chocolate
taste
has
that
familiar
new
belgium
toasty
maltiness
they
must
have
used
copious
amounts
of
biscuit
malt
in
this
one
as
it
tastes
almost
like
a
richer
version
of
fat
tire
only
fermented
with
belgian
yeast
which
gives
it
a
fruity
spicy
herbal
flavor
with
hints
of
bubble
gum
and
apple
very
nice
i
might
say
particularly
wellbalanced
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
the
fruitiness
of
the
yeast
and
lightly
bitter
herbal
hoppiness
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
goes
down
easy
a
tasty
beer
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
good
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
poured
a
burgundy
color
with
a
nice
lievly
fizzy
head
which
dissipated
in
a
minute
or
two
smelled
of
bananas
yeast
and
other
unidentified
fruits
taste
was
excellent
and
smooth
similar
to
the
smell
fruits
slightly
dominated
by
banana
but
mild
excellent
total
mouthfeel
as
expected
with
this
style
drinkability
is
excellent
very
tasty
and
refreshing
without
being
overbearing
in
any
way
great
stuff
im
almost
sad
that
new
belgium
doesnt
distribute
here
as
this
would
be
a
nice
goto
drink
extremely
easy
going
down
and
good
to
drink
great
stuff
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
could
almost
be
a
session
beer
because
it
is
very
light
tasting
for
a
dark
belgianstyle
beer
theres
a
nice
creaminess
also
this
is
the
budget
beer
along
with
the
nb
tripel
for
belgian
ale
fanatics
up
front
i
taste
a
nice
sweetness
and
malt
flavors
this
is
then
followed
by
raisins
black
cherries
or
plums
i
definitely
can
taste
the
darker
fruits
here
there
is
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
it
finishes
off
dry
with
just
a
slight
feeling
a
warmth
from
the
alcohol
d
as
with
all
higher
abv
beers
this
is
a
crapshoot
i
like
this
beer
complex
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
but
not
too
weird
d
carbonation
is
a
bit
strong
in
this
one
and
though
the
abv
is
7
feels
like
more
in
the
taste
and
finish
its
a
good
sipper
ok
after
waking
up
the
next
day
i
have
to
come
back
and
lower
the
drinkability
its
a
great
value
but
man
im
not
used
to
7
abv
in
such
abundance
normally
7
abv
and
up
comes
in
a
bomber
around
here
i
had
five
out
of
the
six
pack
and
mixed
a
couple
of
other
brews
i
ended
up
blasted
still
highly
recommended
for
an
american
brewed
belgian
overall
good
cheery
dubbel
good
price
and
good
quality
for
a
dubbel
that
comes
in
a
6
pack
drink
ability
is
above
average
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
no
problem
well
balanced
complex
brew
that
is
one
of
my
top
six
for
style
d
decent
drinkability
the
carbonation
bite
is
strong
enough
to
weigh
heavily
on
the
palette
abv
is
strong
and
deceptive
but
manageable
pours
a
brownamber
colored
body
with
a
good
sized
head
very
fine
bubbles
and
offwhite
has
an
aroma
of
perfume
sweetness
and
alcohol
a
taste
of
malts
some
perfume
sugar
and
an
aftertaste
of
malt
smells
looks
like
a
dubbel
but
tastes
like
a
browndouble
good
american
recreation
of
a
belgium
ale
only
downside
is
that
for
being
only
7
percent
abv
the
alcohol
is
more
present
than
it
should
be
still
it
is
one
of
the
cheapest
belgium
style
beers
on
the
market
would
buy
again
coram
deo
mt
jealous
i
dont
have
access
to
nb
as
i
would
gladly
buy
this
again
d
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
dubdel
but
for
the
price
and
availability
a
fine
choice
overall
its
an
ok
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
anything
with
a
chocolate
or
caramel
taste
can
taste
the
alcohol
too
easily
as
well
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
great
in
my
book
overall
i
am
very
surprised
by
this
beer
for
it
not
being
belgium
it
is
really
good
there
is
very
nice
malt
complex
that
gives
the
beer
some
umph
the
mouth
feel
is
coating
with
an
alcohol
warming
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
very
tasty
finish
that
last
for
a
few
minutes
i
like
this
beer
and
enjoyed
very
much
this
is
the
beer
that
made
me
fall
in
love
with
new
belgium
i
absolutely
hate
fat
tire
and
i
was
reluctant
to
try
any
of
nbs
other
beers
this
beer
had
a
nice
small
head
and
it
is
a
medium
dark
brown
color
the
smell
is
typical
for
the
style
now
for
the
taste
this
beer
is
as
good
or
better
than
any
belgium
dubbel
ive
tried
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
t
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
active
carbonation
that
makes
the
lighter
body
still
feel
creamy
and
full
strong
malt
body
generally
sweet
with
a
slightly
bready
finish
body
also
has
strong
peppery
spice
flavor
and
slight
nuttiness
very
good
american
take
on
this
style
definitely
let
this
warm
up
before
enjoying
it
id
be
happy
to
have
regular
access
to
this
dit
has
a
nice
smooth
drinkability
that
is
a
little
deceiving
there
is
no
harshness
or
fusal
alcohol
to
it
i
highly
suggest
this
brew
pours
a
beautiful
redamber
brown
color
with
a
small
beige
head
that
leaves
lots
of
web
lacing
ripe
fruit
candy
sugar
caramel
malt
and
cakelike
sweetness
much
is
the
same
with
its
taste
a
bit
of
nuttiness
brown
sugar
and
a
nice
twang
of
hop
paired
with
good
lively
carbonation
on
the
finish
great
drinkability
and
damn
traditional
overall
in
my
opinion
a
benchmark
example
of
a
belgian
style
ale
brewed
here
in
america
d
this
beer
is
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
id
definitely
recommend
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
very
nice
tan
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
is
heavily
fruity
with
bananas
dates
and
maybe
mango
yeast
is
prominent
as
well
along
with
some
lowerkey
malt
it
doesnt
disappoint
upon
tasting
with
malt
and
fruit
coming
through
first
followed
by
some
earthystony
yeast
medium
body
fitting
for
the
style
a
pleasant
take
on
a
dubbel
it
has
a
bold
dark
tan
head
and
thick
lace
dark
and
deep
reddish
brown
colored
body
it
has
an
amazing
aroma
it
smells
of
coffee
toffee
and
sweet
caramel
malts
it
does
have
a
slightly
beany
aroma
the
head
has
a
lot
of
staying
power
and
you
have
to
work
around
its
creaminess
to
get
to
the
actual
beer
it
has
an
incredibly
smooth
roasty
taste
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
it
has
full
body
and
is
very
drinkable
d
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
eatreamly
drinkable
but
for
7
it
is
good
smells
and
tastes
earthy
sweet
start
a
little
hops
in
the
middle
and
a
nice
balanced
tail
end
that
makes
me
want
another
sip
and
another
and
so
on
jk
probably
not
a
beer
id
down
a
ton
of
but
very
enjoyable
the
most
authentic
stab
at
a
great
belgian
style
by
a
nonbelgian
brewer
that
ive
had
as
always
price
and
availability
factor
in
my
drinkability
score
this
one
does
pretty
well
in
both
respects
especially
if
you
find
it
on
sale
excluding
la
folie
the
best
ive
had
from
new
belgium
but
more
to
try
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
when
i
first
moved
to
colorado
so
i
thought
id
give
it
another
try
im
glad
to
say
its
as
great
as
ever
one
of
new
belgiums
best
bottle
offerings
but
still
nothing
compared
to
la
folie
what
is
though
would
like
to
try
the
grand
cru
version
someday
and
see
the
differences
have
not
seen
this
around
too
much
but
a
few
times
recently
on
draft
at
various
locations
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
down
the
road
recommended
t
malty
beer
that
has
a
low
hop
taste
with
a
good
citrus
initial
reaction
yet
as
an
aftertaste
there
is
a
distinct
banana
taste
and
the
clove
and
fig
comes
out
i
would
say
theres
drinkability
to
this
one
due
to
its
good
taste
and
cheap
price
third
best
new
belgium
ive
had
and
a
definite
addition
to
regular
rotation
d
a
nice
beer
my
of
my
favs
that
ive
had
from
new
belgium
good
drinkable
tasty
dubbel
the
taste
is
not
as
great
but
still
good
with
dried
fruit
and
fresh
juicy
fruit
leaves
bread
crust
a
little
sweet
at
first
to
a
drier
finish
its
tasty
easy
to
drink
but
still
a
little
on
the
bland
side
especially
with
food
pours
dark
with
a
nice
big
white
head
that
gets
smaller
but
doesnt
fall
off
completely
laces
strongly
and
uniformly
held
to
the
light
its
a
deep
crimson
colored
body
with
some
nice
carbonation
strong
nose
of
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
with
some
nice
sweetness
in
there
too
flavor
is
a
fruity
nutty
malt
tastes
of
sweet
prunes
alcohol
caramel
malt
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
nutmeg
finish
is
a
little
flat
but
the
malt
and
fruit
stick
around
long
enough
medium
to
full
bodied
holds
up
extremely
well
with
the
best
of
the
belgian
abbey
ales
better
than
most
even
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
really
nice
beer
wish
i
could
get
more
of
it
this
isnt
chimay
by
any
means
but
it
would
be
an
acceptable
substitute
at
a
cheaper
price
when
finances
dictate
di
would
have
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
very
good
dubble
there
be
pirates
after
that
beer
another
winner
from
this
brewery
get
yourself
to
jersey
please
pours
up
a
dark
brown
color
with
crimson
edges
a
nice
big
bubbly
tan

with
great
lacing
the
nose
is
delicious
notes
of
cocoa
chocolate
malts
sweet
belgium

subtle
brown

slight
belgium

as
the

you
get

from
the

medium

carbo
pretty
dry
finish
definately
my
favorite
readily
available
new
belgium
beer
hands
mutha
effin
down
drinkability
ive
had
a
few
dubbels
and
i
must
say
this
a
great
one
at
8
for
a
6
pack
how
can
you
go
wrong
if
you
can
find
it
try
it
on
tap
at
papagos
in
scottsdale
az
its
a
purplebrown
color
with
halfinch
of
offwhite
head
smells
weakly
of
fruit
and
wine
tastes
moderately
of
figs
raisins
with
a
wineline
aftertaste
a
decent
flavor
just
not
that
much
of
it
which
is
the
problem
with
dubbels
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
id
recommend
it
if
a
true
belgian
isnt
available
d
since
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
one
i
will
drink
it
but
its
not
an
enjoyable
one
md
med
to
full
bodied
and
nice
crispness
to
it
a
great
dubbel
for
the
price
i
have
read
that
the
original
house
yeast
was
cultivated
from
the
dregs
of
a
bottle
of
chimay
red
this
is
quite
similar
and
there
is
no
doubt
abbey
belgian
style
ale
is
meant
to
mirror
the
great
trappist
examples
of
the
dubbel
it
has
this
new
belgium
ale
offers
every
bit
of
quality
and
craftsmanship
as
the
great
breweries
of
old
belgium
drinkability
i
thought
this
offering
from
new
belgium
was
a
pretty
nice
american
belgian
styled
dubbel
if
i
do
say
so
myself
d
not
a
session
beer
in
the
least
this
is
a
beer
i
cap
at
two
even
though
it
is
delicious
enough
to
drink
a
few
it
really
makes
for
a
fine
after
dinner
beer
and
pairs
well
with
most
sweet
things
this
is
really
a
special
beer
from
new
belgium
and
definitely
my
favorite
of
their
offerings
other
than
la
folie
of
course
overall
i
must
admit
this
is
one
of
my
top
probably
ten
favourite
beers
so
its
not
exactly
an
unbiased
report
but
it
is
a
tasty
report
one
for
whose
research
i
will
go
back
to
again
and
again
three
big
fingers
of
fat
bubbled
tan
head
that
has
nice
retention
leaving
some
scattered
lace
body
is
a
bold
brown
with
ruby
tones
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
yeasty
with
very
soft
spicey
tones
with
hints
of
clay
and
some
dark
fruit
flavor
is
spice
led
from
the
front
but
very
sessionable
the
dusty
almost
phelonic
spices
are
so
consistant
that
they
almost
become
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
banana
bread
develop
also
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
it
is
good
drinkability
a
great
example
of
belgian
brewing
in
the
us
an
excellently
crafted
brew
a
well
executed
dubbel
great
beer
really
intense
and
truly
belgian
style
however
its
not
something
im
going
to
pick
up
on
every
beerrun
no
single
aroma
or
flavor
is
incredibly
overpowering
and
every
sip
makes
you
want
even
more
everything
just
kind
of
remains
in
this
stasis
of
excellence
the
only
way
that
it
fails
to
remain
there
is
when
you
realize
that
the
bottle
is
empty
this
is
definately
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
new
belgium
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
my
only
regret
is
that
i
didnt
get
the
6pack
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
sticky
finish
a
respectable
dubbel
d
not
a
session
beer
but
it
is
delicious
a
sweet
slighty
tangy
beer
that
you
can
definitely
sense
its
high
alcohol
content
very
well
crafted
and
a
great
dubbel
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
zesty
medium
to
full
in
body
solid
all
around
dubbel
this
pours
and
looks
like
one
of
my
homebrews
thick
creamy
head
and
rich
deep
amber
color
feels
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
caramel
and
rich
malt
flavors
well
balanced
definitely
able
to
notice
7
alcohol
content
not
distracting
or
detracting
but
noticeable
very
very
solid
brew
definitely
a
good
choice
within
the
belgian
style
ale
category
drinkability
is
great
this
is
possibly
my
favorite
new
belgium
beer
and
ive
sampled
many
of
them
its
a
nice
clear
mahogany
in
the
glass
and
keeps
a
nice
ring
of
bubbles
to
the
end
i
smell
spice
dried
fruit
and
some
tropical
fruit
along
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
banana
and
clove
definitely
jump
out
from
the
fruity
malty
flavors
followed
by
some
toffee
and
then
warming
alcohol
lovely
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
was
craving
but
that
probably
helps
its
high
drinkability
hopefully
i
can
get
my
hands
on
more
at
some
pointcome
east
new
belgium
worth
a
try
if
you
dig
the
style
this
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
rendition
of
a
dubbel
d
a
nice
beer
to
drink
without
food
works
well
as
an
accompaniament
to
cheese
dark
fruits
and
hearty
bread
d
good
refreshing
dubbel
an
enjoyable
beer
brought
this
back
from
omaha
as
we
dont
get
this
in
the
twin
cities
yet
this
and
ommegang
are
dubbels
that
i
have
enjoyed
in
this
case
i
liked
the
feel
of
this
beer
other
dubbels
have
seemed
somewhat
watery
this
is
another
exceptional
beer
from
new
belgium
i
poured
into
a
glass
and
it
was
truly
a
beautiful
sight
it
had
a
crystalline
3
finger
foam
that
quickly
fell
into
a
thin
line
the
color
is
a
clear
coppery
tan
and
is
gorgeous
normally
i
dont
use
the
word
gorgeous

finish
on

mouthfeel
is
fairly

although
the

keeps
it
from
scoring
higher
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
this
is
the
7
abv
is
hard
to
detect
a
nice
american
replication
of
a
classic
style
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
i
just
wish
new
belgium
products
were
widely
available
in
my
state
source
liquid
solutions
flavor
is
slightly
spicy
and
sour
with
a
drawn
sweetness
that
drops
under
an
sourness
that
succumbs
to
a
chocolate
plum
flavor
very
enjoyable
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
generous
tan
head
that
rapidly
dissipated
although
it
never
quite
vanished
not
a
whole

of

had
a
mild
spicy
fruity
smell
felt
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
less
hopiness
than
most
beers
ive
drank
of
late
the
taste
is
of
banannas
cloves
as
many
others
have
said
i
felt
there
was
also
a
little
caramel
in
the
mix
in
general
it
has
a
mild
yet
interesting
flavor
this
doesnt
seem
like
a
lot
of
beer
after
youve
finished
the
first
bottle
but
its
relatively
high
alcohol
content
of
7
would
probably
catch
up
to
you
if
used
throughout
an
evening
ive
never
had
fat
tire
and
what
ive
read
on
ba
tells
me
thats
been
a
good
thing
my
brother
calls
it
chick
beer
but
if
new
belgium
makes
more
beers
like
this
id
drink
them

hops
pale

ibus
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
good
thanks
to
jeffboo
for
the
bottle
a
very
good
belgian
style
beer
the
only
thing
id
like
to
see
with
this
brew
is
more
yeast
in
the
bottle
but
that
is
a
very
small
complaint
if
you
see
this
one
in
your
local
beer
store
give
it
a
try
you
won¬ít
be
disappointed
definitely
a
good
beer
not
as
sweet
or
light
as
other
belgian
style
ales
but
this
one
definitely
carves
its
own
niche
in
the
style
at
this
price
i
could
see
this
beer
becoming
one
of
the
mainstays
in
my
fridge
new
belgium
consistently
impresses
me
with
their
belgian
style
beers
keep
up
the
good
work
not
bad
at
all
but
more
interesting
belgians
abound
good
in
the
mouth
and
altogether
a
rather
good
a
american
belgian
style
ale
if
this
is
just
the
american
version
i
look
forward
to
my
first
chimnay
or
other
often
mentioned
belgian
dubbels
slight
head
and
a
purely
peachy
color
aroma
is
magical
delightful
a
veritable
fruit
salad
in
the
nose
tropical
fruits
mango
banana
great
hop
presence
and
a
delicious
spark
on
the
tongue
light
in
texture
and
body
but
full
of
flavor
medium
carbonation
and
again
a
beautiful
little
ballet
by
hops
on
the
palate
an
excellent
dubbel
one
of
the
best
stateside
versions
ive
ever
encountered
if
not
the
best
an
awesome
reddish
brown
color
with
the
perfect
head
the
lacing
was
the
best
part
this
was
the
first
abbey
i
tried
and
i
was
impressed
i
was
not
expecting
the
fruity
aroma
which
was
pleasant
mixed
with
the
aroma
of
the
alcohol
bananas
dominates
the
smell
but
is
very
faint
in
the
taste
the
malts
dominate
the
taste
which
is
well
balanced
with
the
sweetness
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
however
unlike
what
it
is
says
on
the
bottle
i
think
this
beer
is
better
cold
than
cool
as
it
sits
the
taste
thins
out
a
great
deal
i
believe
it
is
best
to
drink
this
beer
quickly
i
have
mixed
feeling
on
this
one
an
excellent
example
of
belgian
style
ales
the
color
is
beautiful
and
golden
brown
with
a
tinge
of
redness
to
it
the
bouquet
is
perfect
hops
with
alcohol
and
fruity
accents
the
flavor
does
not
match
the
bouquet
i
was
expecting
a
taste
that
rivaled
chimay
based
on
the
nose
and
the
thickness
of
the
head
but
was
let
down
by
something
that
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
the
beer
starts
off
well
and
starts
to
peter
out
on
flavor
on
the
finish
the
balance
seems
to
get
lost
after
exposure
to
air
for
more
than
say
10
minutes
so
drink
this
one
fast
dont
linger
on
it

flavor
the
best
american
for
this
style
a
great
brew
pours
a
deep
reddish
amber
color
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
banana
peel
with
hints
of
citrus
and
honey
the
taste
is
of
ripe
bananas
apples
and
figs
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
new
belgium
brewing
inc
great
americanized
version
of
a
belgian
ale
very
appealing
amber
color
with
a
very
thick
beige
head
and
good
lacing
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
some
spillage
that
may
have
been
the
result
of
shipping
thanks
to
the
gentleman
who
traded
for
it
nice
spicy
and
fruity
aroma
nicely
complex
flavor
consisting
of
bananas
alcohol
and
some
other
fruits
this
is
definitely
a
worthy
effort
at
the
belgian
style
from
a
stateside
brewer
i
have
always
found
this
beer
interesting
but
the
acidity
and
spicyness
wear
on
me
and
i
cant
drink
a
lot
of
it
which
is
suprissing
since
the
much
spicyer
and
tart
saisons
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
just
dont
think
the
combination
works
as
well
with
this
dubbel
update
41403
same
batch
as
previous
two
reviews
this
time
i
get
more
caramel
some
lingering
banana
aftertaste
no
bubblegum
now
taste
is
more
syruppy
and
doppelbocklike
i
think
i
liked
the
taste
a
couple
months
ago
best
before
march
8
2003
maybe
45
months
is
optimal
cellar
time
a
nice
beer
though
perhaps
a
bit
light
dare
i
say
americanized
for
the
style
still
congrats
to
new
belgium
for
putting
out
beers
of
this
quality
this
bottle
is
a
little
over
2
years
old
so
im
looking
forward
to
the
changes
the
pour
is
a
deep

the

hazy

with
a
2
12
finger
offwhite
head
smells
delicious
revealing
a
combination
of
fruits
with
banana
being
very
apparent
with
traces
of
alcohol
as
well
very
warming
alcohol
taste
with
pungent
fruit
flavors
with
a
trace
of
yeast
and
tapers
to
a
slight
cough
syrup
finish
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
very
well
cheers
after
tasting
4
new
belgium
brews
over
the
past
few
nights
i
have
come
to
the
conclussion
that
they
are
a
high
quality
brewery
aroma
consists
of
dark
fruits
and
spicy
clove
notes
somewhat
like
a
hefeweizen
taste
begins
with
clove
and
banana
flavors
gives
way
to
strong
alcohol
finishing
with
rather
bitter
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
though
less
than
spectacular
a
very
nice
beer
well
worth
a
try
although
i
would
not
choose
it
for
a
session
brew
as
there
is
something
a
bit
overpowering
about
it
this
is
another
sock
knocker
from
new
belgium
much
like
but
a
bit
lighter
than
the
ommegang
brew
of
the
same
style
this
beer
pours
with
a
deep
dark
amber
color
and
a
foamy
tannish
head
the
extra
yeast
from
bottle
conditioning
adds
a
fruity
malty
yeast
aroma
than
is
very
inviting
the
initial
tanginess
of
the
yeast
is
quite
a
nice
touch
to
a
well
balanced
very
tasty
beer
with
a
clean
finish
chestnut
colored
with
a
nice
amount
of
thick
tan
head
belgian
yeast
aromas
are
evident
from
the
start
and
continue
into
the
mouth
i
found
this
to
be
a
relatively
bland
and
subdued
version
of
a
dubbel
but
nothing
was
truly
off
just
toned
down
i¬íve
had
beers
that
i
thought
that
where
all
most
as
good
as
sex
never
before
have
i
had
a
beer
i
might
be
willing
to
give
up
sex
for
what
should
you
expect
from
a
new
belgium
product
nothing
but
the
best
a
sediment
packed
mahogany
presentation
alcohals
paradise
grains
clove
and
bananas
on
the
palate
thinner
bodied
than
the
titan
ommegang
ommegang

a
flavor
that
is
not
as
enduring

this
is

deep
mahogany

spicy

warming
hints
figgish
flavor
with
very
dry

substantial
hop

alongside
a
yeasty
flavor
very
pleasant
as
it
warms
and
the
bitterness
subsides
some
fruity
spicy
flavors
balance
with
dark
malt
very
complex
and
a
great
offering
from
nb
at
first
i
was
ready
to
criticize
this
beer
for
being
too
clean
and
a
little
thin
but
as
the
beer
warmed
and
especially
after
a
dose
of
yeast
the
complexities
really
began
to
come
out
a
solid
abbey
not
as
rustic
as
our
east
coast
version
allagash
double
thats
not
a
criticism
just
a
comparison
thanks
to
jaybeerman
for
the
sample
spicy
with
a
very
pronounced
yeast
presence
pours
out
to
a
very
dark
ruby
color
definetely
gets
better
as
it
warms
very
good
but
not
outstanding
i
wouldve
preferred
just
a
little
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
spiciness
thanks
to
jaybeerman
for
sending
this
my
way
hazy
light
brown
in
color
with
an
attractive
and
persistent

when
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
huge
bubblegum
esters
dominate
the
aroma
but
slight
green
apple
acetaldehyde
is
in
the
background
fruity
belgian
yeast
contibutions
comprise
the
forefront
of
nb
abbeys
taste
banana
and
bubblegum
borderline
on
being
overbearing
but
thankfully
are
ensued
by
a
pleasant
slightly
roasted
and
raisinlike
special
b
dark
belgian
caramel
malt
flavor
its
medium
bodied
and
the
smooth
mouthfeel
helps
accentuate
the
subtle
caramel
flavors
it
finishes
slightly
sweet
w
special
b
burnt
toffee
flavors
on
the
tongue
although
this
is
certainly
a
flavorful
brew
it
lacks
the
complex
belgian
yeasty
notes
that
are
integral
to
a
dubbel
it
was
a
bit
too
clean
to
balance
the
very
strong
bubblegum
and
banana
flavors
theres
nothing
offputting
about
this
beer
however
o
the
appearance
and
aromas
are
outstanding
but
the
flavors
are
good
but
not
great
great
floral
and
fruit
notes
in
taste
even
a
sweet
nose
on
it
fantastic
balance
and
dry
finish
an
unimpressive
dubbel
in
my
opinion
and
thats
that
if
was
on
draught
at
the
abbey
brewing
co
in
miami
beach
fl
one
of
their
house
beers
if
im
drinking
a
9ter
i
want
to
be
taken
on
some
sort
of
a
journey
this
one
just
fell
flat
on
its
face
thank
god
for
samples
had
their
triple
and
it
was
better
but
unimpressive
as
well
overall
i
think
in
the
class
this
beer
is
too
chocolaty
syrupy
and
sweet
it
is
missing
spice
complexity
litefruits
fruityyeast
complexity
bitterness
and
hop
complexity
overall
it
is
off
in
taste
for
a
belgian
double
i
wouldnt
consider
it
a
belgian
double
in
a
blindfolded
taste
test
it
tastes
more
like
a
lite
perhaps
fruitier
and
spicier
seasonal
sweet
chocolaty
stout
to
me
but
definitely
misses
the
mark
on
a
belgian
style
double
the
sweetness
is
too
overpowering
and
cocacola
tasting
and
this
really
kills
the
beer

nice

3

a
very
good
dubbel
bordering
on
outstanding
the
maltiness
in
this
beer
is
way
too
much
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
taste
is
also
distracting
and
way
off
the
mark
this
beer
is
also
far
too
big
for
a
dubbel
9
abv
is
probably
from
where
most
of
the
taste
problems
can
be
traced
nonetheless
this
is
a
darn
good
beer
and
is
well
worth
the
purchase
its
just
that
it
is
not
the
best
example
of
a
dubbel
on
the
market
even
if
it
was
brewed
using
solar
power
as
per
the
bottle
cap
i
liked
this
and
for
a
domestic
dubbed
pretty
good
it
took
me
a
while
but
i
finally
pulled
the
trigger
on
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
rubybrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
wan
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
brown
sugar
dried
maple
sugar
light
cardboard
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
and
a
twinge
of
banana
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
contingent
of
dark
fruit
and
banana
and
a
pervasive
feeling
of
cardboard
and
old
nuts
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
slick
feel
overall
this
dubbel
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
im
hoping
its
past
its
prime
considering
the
strange
and
unappealing
flavors
but
i
have
my
doubts
oa
perfectly
acceptable
but
nonwow
inducing
dubbel
i
think
its
good
value
for
the
price
if
nothing
else
but
there
are
always
more
exciting
enticing
options
where
belgian
beers
are
concerned
i
doubt
id
buy
another
considering
its
9
for
the
bomber
one
of
those
brews
i
dont
feel
ripped
off
but
have
no
reason
for
a
second
strong
aroma
has
earthy
malty
and
caramel
notes
with
a
hint
of
hops
it
pours
a
dark
coppery
brown
with
a
thick
and
rather
persistent
light
tan
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
scrumptious
flavor
has
caramel
malty
nutty
earthy
and
subtle
maple
syrup
notes
not
too
sweet
very
slightly
hoppy
rich
texture
has
plenty
of
tingle
and
fizz
smooth
yet
lively
very
satisfying
an
excellent
party
to
brother
davids
tripel
o
it
is
definitely
unique
for
the
style
in
all
aspects
very
reminiscent
of
a
rich
red
wine
definitely
tasty
but
some
minor
deductions
relative
to
the
style
i
like
it
a
solid
dubbel
style
ale
a
decent
enough
dubbel
the
fruit
and
fervent
malt
in
accordance
with
some
real
deal
belgian
yeast
render
a
pleasant
warming
tipple
especially
as
the
18proof
booze
remains
very
well
obfuscated
in
the
unusually
positive
sense
of
the
word
another
bahl
hornin
offering
from
this
nocal
institution
amber
in
color
with
a
khaki
colored
head
nose
is
really
quite
boozy
some
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
toffee
and
mild
spice
a
little
bit
of
banana
and
bubblegum
too
the
flavor
isnt
bad
as
far
as
the
sugar
and
sweetness
goes
good
date
fig
and
raisin
fruit
notes
mild
banana
and
a
hint
of
spice
but
the
beer
is
just
far
too
boozy

really
be

is

also
to
note
i
had
this

while
it
was
in
the
55f

range
so
it
really
opened
up
i
suspect
a
lot
of
the
lower
reviews
came
from
bas
who
may
have
downed
it
at
fridge
temp
o
its
a
decent
belgian

dubbel
some
good
flavors
but
may
be
a
little
too
sweet
overall
my
first
anderson

hope
the
rest
are
as
good
as
this
tripel
or
dipa
up
next
the
flavor
has
more
bubblegum
notes
to
it
along
with
some
nice
caramel
malts
and
a
pleasing
finish
its
nicely
rounded
sweet
without
being
cloyingly
so
enjoyable
medium

and
a
bit
of
an

decent
dubbel
not
to
the
standards
of
a
real
belgian
but
tasty
overall
overall
disappointing
though
i
keep
giving
anderson
valley
a
chance
ive
never
come
across
a
beer
from
them
that
i
really
dug
saddened
this
isnt
better
than
what
i
expected
reviewed
on
03252011
012317
i
though
this
was
an
excellent
beer
i
was
referred
to
drinking
it
by
a
classmate
at
a
beer
class
at
total
wine
i
actually
thought
there
was
a
plethora
of
flavor
that
came
to
the
surface
upon
first
drink
i
did
notice
that
this
is
one
belgian
style
ale
that
is
better
not
sipped
if
you
are
thinking
about
trying
this
one
get
about
one
solid
mouthful
before
you
judge
it
i
dunno
love
the
american
style
anderson
valley
so
maybe
im
not
the
best
source
for
a
review
of
this
beer
but
ill
be
avoiding
this
one
for
the
near
future
this
isnt
great
but
is
enjoyable
enough
if
one
doesnt
mind
its
boozy
bite
overall
i
like
the
spicy
kick
but
the
9
abv
is
too
much
for
the
style
and
the
body
and
malt
is
not
big
enough
to
hide
it
i
reasonably
enjoyed
it
but
wont
be
going
back
soon
nothing
wrong
but
a
bit
unharmonized
and
simple
a
nice
american
version
of
this
style
not
the
best
not
even
close
but
still
nice
od
quite
cloying
no
a
great
dubbel
sweet
and
hard
to
finish
but
not
offensive
but
too
much
of
something
i
dont
particularily
like
o
overall
this
isnt
bad
i
think
if
they
pumped
up
the
flavor
a
little
bit
with
some
caramel
or
coffee
or
something
it
would
be
a
stellar
beer
dr
the
thickness
and
fullness
of
body
slow
down
ones
drinking
pace
but
the
tradeoff
is
flavour
its
a
flavourful
luscious
beer
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
the
price
could
be
better
even
here
in
california
id
recommend
this
to
any
fan
of
the
style
or
to
fans
of
winter
warmers
but
its
not
exemplary
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
dark
fruits
dominate
the
aroma
not
too
authentically
belgian
flavor
is
more
dark
fruits
caramel
and
yeast
slightly
metallic
medium
on
the
palate
pretty
decent
overall
o
id
opt
for
a
real
belgian
for
what
i
paid
for
the
22oz
i
could
have
had
a
real
belgian
dubbel
i
like
avb
but
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
them
ill
probably
steer
clear
of
their
belgianesque
offerings
from
now
on
o
a
decent
dubbel
its
worth
a
try
but
the
alcohol
is
probably
a
bit
overdone
o
a
decent
dubbel
nutty
fruity
boozyit
loses
a
bit
of
the
flavor
on
the
back
end
but
a
decent
beer
overall
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
i
came
across
more
beers
from
this
brewer
as
i
like
most
of
what
they
make
o
decent
for
the
price
believe
i
payed
about
5
but
not
something
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
especially
given
the
higher
alcohol
content
for
the
style
jd
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
with
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
and
little
retention
the
aroma
is
strong
with
caramel
notes
and
some
maltiness
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
almost
brown
aleish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
and
nicely
balanced
but
fairly
average
overall
an
ok
beer
but
im
not
sure
it
really
fits
the
style
to
me
this
beer
is
more
of
a
quad
than
a
dubbel
the
intense
heat
is
not
in
keeping
with
a
style
that
is
known
for
masking
its
strength
id
consider
buying
this
in
a
bottle
again
and
i
would
order
it
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
in
a
heartbeat
this
beer
comes
out
a
ruddy
and
rugged
brown
i
went
with
a
vigorous
pour
for
this
but
still
ended
up
with
very
little
in
terms
of
head
cloudy
with
some
light
carbonation
pulling
the
beer
right
out
of
the
fridge
the
aroma
is
very
muted
with
hints
of
raisin
as
the
beer
warms
i
get
more
hints
of
dark
fruit
with
figs
and
plums
to
go
along
with
the
raisin
theres
some
nice
brown
sugar
sweetness
in
the
background
almost
like
molasses
very
enjoyable
just
from
smell
alone
taste
is
very
fruity
with
that
sweetness
from
the
nose
helping
to
balance
things
out
in
the
end
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
certainly
comes
out
especially
in
the
finish
but
isnt
obnoxious
like
others
can
be
this
beer
is
very
well
rounded
and
smooth
from
beginning
to
end
very
enjoyable
poured
from
a

densely
bubbled
tancolored
head
aromas
of
dark
fruits
including
prunes
and
dates
as
well
as
spices
and
sweet

the
flavors
are
very
smooth

and
a

over

spices
are
present

and
it
tastes
a
bit

the
flavors
are
unbelievably
smooth

the
aftertaste
is

spicing

i
had
the
rochefort
10
last
night
and
this
is
not
nearly
as
complex
this
is
a
very
good
american
beer
but
not
great
edit
when
i
first
submitted
this
the
numbers
came
out
to
d
and
i
guess
i
think
it
is
not
a
good
beer
but
it
probably
isnt
a
d
on
the
scale
beers
are
measured
on
here
at
ba
so
i
am
going
to
adjust
the
numbers
up
a
slight
bit
darker
than
some
tripel
abbey
ales
ive
seen
and
drank
in
the
past
its
almost
brown
in
its
shade
even
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
was
modest
and
faded
out
fairly
quickly
but
a
good
bit
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
notes
of
caramel
apples
along
with
a
big
blast
of
alcohol
show
up
in
the
scent
there
are
the
banana
spices
and
hint
of
honey
thing
in
the
flavor
that
are
common
for
the
style
but
they
seem
to
get
bossed
around
by
too
much
of
a
grainy
malt
as
it
warms
the
malts
do
step
away
somewhat
but
what
seems
to
be
left
is
something
slightly
lacking
as
far
as
a
complexity
as
well
as
a
little
thin
as
far
as
the
body
is
concerned
too
one
thing
i
did
find
interesting
is
that
though
the
alcohol
comes
on
quite
strong
in
the
scent
it
is
hidden
very
well
in
the
taste
til
you
get
almost
to
the
very
end
almost
because
there
is
a
hotness
that
comes
out
right
at
the
tail
that
will
bite
you
if
youre
not
ready
for
it
review
based
on
notes
from
a
tasting
on
jan
26
2011
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
the
flavor
profile
seemed
almost
artificial
as
though
the
yeast
didnt
add
enough
character
initially
not
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
even
though
this
is
made
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
wont
buy
it
again
id
rather
try
other
belgian
ales
i
will
give
boonville
credit
for
the
low
price
of
699
for
a
22
oz
bottle
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
challenging
there
is
very
little
yeast
character
or
anything
other
than
malt
for
a
big
malty
onesided
monster
it
drinks
well
and
isnt
necessarily
boring
for
all
that
on
a
night
as
cold
as
this
its
welcome
d
abv
is
almost
spot
on
for
9
pretty
well
hidden
through
34ths
of
the
bottle
then
it
hits
you
problem
is
cost
20
for
a
bomber
is
a
lot
when
i
get
get
belgians
for
much
cheaper
here
still
would
get
again
when
and
up
with
cash
and
want
to
try
our
american
attempts
at
belgian
styles
overall
impression
excellent
flavor
for
a
belgian
but
lacking
the
body
and
mouthfeel
worth
a
try
or
two
very
good
brew
nice
complexity
alcohol
well
hidden
fruits
are
up
front
with
nice
balance
of
yeasts
and
hops
would
not
turn
one
down
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
drinkability
not
bad
for
a
cheaper
dubbel
nice
smells
and
decent
flavors
however
it
does
become
a
bit
sickeningly
sweet
and
the
abv
would
be
a
tad
high
for
too
much
pours
a
burnt
red
bordering
on
brown
with
an
off
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
sticking
lacing
smell
is
cherries
chocolate
caramel
and
nuts
a
bit
of
spice
taste
brings
forward
some
dark
fruits
as
well
as
dark
cherries
and
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
coats
the
palate
drinks
quite
well
and
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
american
versions
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
d
good
with
smell
and
taste
just
not
much
to
look
at
carbonation
and
body
both
seemed
a
little
low
disguised
the
abv
pretty
well
goes
down
very
easily
a
pleasant
sipper
a
rich
brown
chocolate
color
with
a
thin
taupe
head
that
poured
less
than
on
finger
thick
disappointing
a
lot
of
malt
i
love
the
hints
of
leather
and
tobacco
the
first
sip
brings
out
some
fruit
apricots
and
black
cherries
and
a
bready
feel
its
almost
like
drinking
a
liquid
fig
newton
there
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
and
a
burnt
finish
that
shows
up
after
the
heat
disappears
this
beer
is
almost
to
complex
it
would
probably
do
well
in
a
cellar
for
a
little
while
1
year
max
it
is
similar
to
a
belgian
but
defiantly
americanized
with
the
overwhelming
flavors
and
high
alcohol
funny
how
many
of
the
elements
seem
to
be
in
place
for
this
to
be
good
but
somehow
it
doesnt
quite
work
as
well
as
it
should
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
one
of
anderson
valleys
better
offerings
and
nowhere
near
the
best
in
the
style
d
the
beer
is
rather
drinkable
considering
its
level
of
alcohol
content
although
this
is
one
that
is
better
sipped
d
im
glad
i
tried
this
it
follows
the
basics
of
a
dubbel
pretty
well
just
needs
to
be
refined
fuller
mouthfeel
and
a
slightly
higher
carbonation
would
do
wonders
with
this
beer
relatively
high
abv
hinders
drinkability
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
nonetheless
nothing
outstanding
but
fairly
drinkable
and
tasty
its
not
a
bad
dubbel
but
it
seems
like
they
made
the
most
common
american
craft
brewer
mistake
amping
it
up
and
losing
the
point
of
the
style
a
dubbel
is
a
relatively
strong
beer
but
9
seems
a
bit
steep
plus
the
flavors
should
be
more
rounded
and
complimentary
instead
this
beer
almost
seems
to
fight
with
itself
good
effort
definitely
worth
trying
well
this
one
is
better
than
the
tripel
version
just
because
it
aint
so
dang
sweet
still
not
a
lot
to
it
other
than
well
with
an
aggresive
pour
got
a
little
light
tan
to
cream
colored
head
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
mahoganey
aroma
is
vanilla
malt
fruit
flavor
is
the
same
and
not
awfully
complex
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
i
wont
finish
the
bottle
only
a
few
sips
actually
be
good
for
cooking
not
drinking
meh
ive
had
this
bottle
a
few
months
and
just
got
around
to
it
just
a
short
review
this
a
typical
if
a
bit
above
average
example
of
the
style
the
reddishbrown
color
the
fruity
yeasty
aroma
and
taste
the
full
but
not
heavy
body
and
nice
drinkability
combine
to
make
a
beer
that
would
make
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
and
a
nice
revisit
for
fans
of
the
style
like
me
worth
drinking
if
the
brewery
was
closer
id
get
another
bottle
a
very
good
american
take
on
a
belgian
classic
overall
not
the
best
and
not
really
worth
it
d
a
very
well
done
american
take
on
the
style
drinks
nicely
i
would
be
willing
to
wager
that
if
this
were
more
expensive
and
from
a
small
european
brewery
this
would
have
much
higher
ratings
d
tasty
almost
candy
like
easy
to
drink
but
the
dark
sweetness
might
be
a
bit
too
much
also
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
night
cap
for
me
it
is
hard
to
define
drinkability
i
think
this
would
make
a
great
companion
with
any
beef
dish
and
even
a
spicy
dish
in
addition
i
could
see
myself
getting
saucy
on
a
few
of
these
as
if
that
helps
your
decision
i
recommend
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
lightly
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
residual
candi
sugar
taste
is
not
overly
complex
with
some
bland
caramel
malts
with
some
easily
noticeable
candi
sugar
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
style
with
ok
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
lacking
some
complexity
and
character
with
too
much
sugar
notes
altogether
a
delightfully
balanced
and
enjoyable
brew
but
just
not
at
the
top
of
the
heap
in
terms
of
complex
flavors
i
enjoyed
brother
davids
dubbel
a
great
deal
my
favorite
dubbel
to
date
it
was
plenty
complex
for
me
and
the
fact
that
it
was
not
over
carbonated
was
a
plus
d
not
a
bad
flavor
fairly
drinkable
beer
for
the
burn
at
the
end
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
but
i
doubt
this
will
be
the
last
time
i
buy
this
beer
nothing
to
see
here
move
along
drinkable
but
just
ok
could
be
better
if
it
were
balanced
better
it
seems
to
be
both
too
sweet
and
too
bitter
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
spicy
profile
and
sweet

character
dark
fruit
notes
mostly
plum

and

with
subtle
hazelnut
and
earthy
hops
nice
alcohol
warmth
in
the
dry
finish
drinkability
this
is
not
a
refreshing
beer
it
goes
well
with
indulgent
foods
like
sausage
the
taste
is
similar
to
a
chimay
blue
except
i
always
want
more
chimay
blue
not
so
here
d
just
too
sweet
to
do
anything
but

good

there

would
pick
first
this
is
a
decent
belgianstyle
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
d
this
is
a
nice
dubbel
looks
great
and
is
very
drinkable
poured
a
lightly
veiled

smooth

that
rapidly

sweet
up

a
strong

flavor
dominating
from
the
first

alchohol
and
a
very
slight
hops
presence
come
in
very
late
a
bit
too
late
imo
some
interesting
flavors
that
never
seem
to
come
together
in
a
balanced
whole
mouthfeel
is
think
with
carbonation
that
seems
a
bit
light
for
the
style
combined
with
the
sweetness
it
gives
the
beer
an
initial
syrupy
quality
which
is
a
bit
unusual
for
the
style
altogether
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgianstyle
doubles
this
is
worth
trying
but
will
likely
fall
short
of
your
favorites
conclusion
i
paired
this
with
some
dried
figs
and
some
good
pumpernickel
bread
the
combination
was
really
nice
and
the
beers
pretty
good
but
it
doesnt
really
go
beyond
that
its
somewhat
onedimensional
and
a
bit
simple
if
still
pretty
tasty
this
is
by
no
means
my
favorite
belgian
style
beer
but
i
did
enjoy
it
maybe
it
just
doesnt
have
the
complexity
i
was
looking
for
or
expecting
it
seemed
to
be
lacking
a
little
too
much
to
review
it
as
an
outstanding
beer
syrupy
but
not
unpleasantly
as
i
usually
find
such
a
feel
nothing
really
stands
out
about
the
feel
though
restrained
but
consistent
co2
prickliness
more
sweet
than
i
expectedcloser
to
a
barley
wine
in
terms
of
taste
theres
the
lightest
of
prickly
hop
in
the
backgroundnot
really
balancing
rich
body
with
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
short
warming
alcohol
in
the
swallow
but
not
noteworthy
in
the
taste
while
other
dubbels
may
be
much
more
full
than
this
one
this
is
a
good
product
most
dubbels
have
more
going
on
than
this
product
more
raisin
more
plum
more
alcohol
bite
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
belgian
dubbels
without
scaring
the
crap
out
of
them
worth
it
to
down
a
few
but
not
on
a
favorite
list
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
quite
come
off
as
a
good
dubbel
overall
its
a
decent
double
thats
worth
a
try
anderson
valley
makes
several
other
beers
that
are
better
in
their
class
and
if
you
ask
me
the
belgians
they
are
attempting
seem
to
be
lacking
something
of
course
if
you
get
a
chance
check
out
the
brewery
and
take
the
tour
its
worth
it
drinkability
decent
beer
and
a
slow
sipper
one
bomber
is
enough
for
one
session
d
a
little
too
much
alcohol
for
me
but
could
age
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
chalice
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
thin
tan
head
plenty
of
carbonation
fruity
spicy
aroma
medium
bodied
with
a
rich
mouthfeel
dark
sugar
and
fruit
flavors
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
i
found
this
to
be
lacking
when
compared
with
a
belgian
rendition
as
well
as
many
american
versions
this
is
good
session
drinking
if
you
are
into
belgians
and
dont
want
to
bust
the
bank
a
solid
rendition
of
a
dubbel
dark
brown
pour
with
no
head
aroma
of
prunes
yeast
and
raisins
the
taste
is
really
strong
and
the
alcohol
is
not
masked
at
all
prunes
and
malt
dominate
the
beer
the
heavy
mouthfeel
makes
it
even
less
drinkable
the
spice
was
nice
but
everything
else
is
a
bit
overwhelming
and
lose
the
fake
wax
it
makes
the
bottle
really
hard
to
open
my
expectation
where
met
its
drinkable
but
its
just
very
ordinary
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
though
if
it
were
the
only
belgian
style
on
the
menu
id
try
it
not
recommended
since
there
are
more
readily
available
doubles
out
there
that
are
better
drinkability
i
woud
certainly
serve
this
to
my
friends
d
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
luckily
i
had
this
at
the
brewery
so
i
dont
think
ill
have
any
trouble
finding
something
else
to
drink
d
the
drinkablility
suffers
a
little
from
the
higher
abv
but
this
is
a
pretty
decent
dubbel
nonetheless
that
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
the
overall
impression
is
pleasant
and
mostly
authentic
although
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
out
again
as
there
are
enough
belgian
beers
that
are
much
more
complex
and
rich
not
bad
at
all
for
the
price
and
abv
would
be
nice
to
sip
on
with
the
fam
around
the
holidays
not
everyday
not
for
me
poured
into
a
chalice
not
much
for
head
retention
or
production
color
is
a
nice
brown
syrupy
with
a
little
haze
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
raisins
the
taste
is
sweetiness
coming
through
but
not
exactly
to
the
beligum
style
still
a
good
beer
but
i
would
go
with
an
authentic
dubbel
when
in
the
mood
the
alcohol
warms
you
throughout
the
session
medium
body
with
a
sticky
coating
all
over
your
mouth
dried
dark
fruits
come
to
mind
as
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
d
this
beer
is
great
excellent
balance
not
overpowering
in
any
category
wish
that
i
lived
in
ca
to
enjoy
it
more
i
like
this
much
more
than
their
tripel
good
american
version
of
a
belgian
dubbel
drinkability
not
entirely
too
bad
i
honestly
enjoyed
it
d
notes
i
like
this
beer
good
balance
between
malt
and
esteryeast
compliments
drinkable
with
nice
alcohol
warmth
a
good
beer
this
broadly
fits
into
the
style
a
bit
different
fruitier
for
one
thing
and
not
quite
up
to
par
as
a
classic
dubbel
but
a
nice
beer
on
its
own
imo
d
this
has
a
high
abv
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
so
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
not
notice
in
terms
of
taste
though
i
would
buy
something
different
d
overall
great
complexity
and
example
though
the
high
alcohol
will
certainly
limit
drinkability
but
not
enjoyability
a
good
american
example
worth
a
second
try
in
the
future
this
poured
a
clear
burgundy
with
thing
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
wild
yeast
and
floral
hops
with
some
prunes
and
dark
chocolate
it
tasted
strongly
of
wild
yeast
mixed
with
a
blend
of
floral
hops
and
bitter
chocolate
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
very
clean
but
had
that
typical
belgian
taste
that
i
dont
particularly
care
for
not
so
great
for
a
dark
ale
overall
to
me
this
is
a
fair
dubbel
but
too
sweet
and
fairly
plain
not
bad
but
not
anything
memorable
either
the
beer
poured
a
brownishamber
with
a
rocky
tan
head
into
a
12oz
pilsner
glass
the
smell
was
of
belgian
yeast
and
alcoholic
esters
a
fairly
nice
flavor
combination
of
the
belgian
yeast
byproduct
flavors
plum
date
etc
and
the
sweet
candy
sugar
with
significant
alcoholic
esters
as
well
a
nice
abbey
ale
but
there
was
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
which
while
not
overwhelming
was
a
bit
bothersome
good
carbonation
and
lacing
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
id
like
to
get
another
bottle
and
hold
onto
it
for
a
bit
see
how
it
compares
to
next
year
not
a
bad
dubbel
but
perhaps
cellering
it
will
help
a
lot
decent
mouthfeel
with
an
equally
good
level
of
drinkability
despite
the
hefty
9
abv
not
bad
from
anderson
valley
although
ive
certainly
tasted
better
both
in
the
style
and
from
the
brewery
d
not
a
bad
dubbel
but
there
are
plenty
of
others
id
rather
have
for
the
price
just
like
the
saying
goes
you
get
what
you
pay
for
though
quite
affordable
for
a
dubbel
its
really
not
worth
it
looks
and
smells
nice
but
something
is
just
wrong
with
the
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
the
taste
was
really
spicy
i
could
grab
a
orange
flavor
in
the
front
with
a
maltiness
throughout
in
the
mouth
is
gave
off
an
odd
flavor
on
the
finish
which
was
not
that
pleasing
it
was
an
okay
brew
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
the
flavors
were
average
and
the
spiciness
was
overwhelming
d
absolutely
delicious
alcohol
is
subtle
for
the
abv
better
than
some
belgian
dubbels
i
have
had
loads
of
flavor
so
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
this
was
a
great
christmas
present
thanks
rob
drinkability
i
would
call
the
drinkability
ok
this
bomber
is
drinkable
but
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
more
of
these
ive
had
brother
davids
dubbel
a
bunch
of
times
over
the
years
and
it
always
strikes
me
as
a
this
could
have
been
brewed
in
belgium
brew
suprising
complexity
for
an
american
take
on
such
a
tough
style
to
pin
down
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
dry
slightly
sweet
and
tart
and
drinkable
with
nary
a
touch
of
detectable
abv
oelergud
a
malty
vinously
fruity
dubbel
mellow
and
rounded
for
9
abv
reserved
and
enjoyable
compared
to
its
bulkier
high
octane
older
brother
brother
davids
tripel
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
will
definately
try
other
dubbelor
double
styles
before
i
decide
if
this
is
good
or
not
seeing
as
its
my
first
of
this
category
worth
a
try
for
sure
pours
clear
and
dark
brown
with
toffee
colored
highlights
and
a
thin
huskcolored
head
that
forms
a
collar
on
the
beer
aromas
are
not
terribly
interesting
some
vanilla
and
coconut
alcohol
fumes
and
rich
malts
with
a
demerera
edge
its
pretty
but
not
too
evocative
on
the
palate
though
its
more
interesting
as
things
start
with
some
tangy
fruits
before
moving
to
some
phenolic
notes
and
then
some
sweet
smooth
and
nutty
malts
very
smooth
and
well
integrated
mouthfeel
is
excellent
for
the
style
with
carbonation
that
effectively
lightens
things
but
otherwise
doesnt
assert
itself
overall
im
impressed
this
is
not
the
most
flavorful
or
worldbeating
example
of
the
dubbel
style
but
it
is
drinkable
rich
without
being
heavy
and
delectable
which
strikes
me
as
a
pretty
good
description
of
what
youd
want
a
dubbel
to
be
d
meh
high
octane
double
with
a
flavor
that
is
mediocre
at
best
the
smell
is
virtually
nonexist
it
does
look
nice
though
it
is
easy
enough
to
drink
in
spite
of
negatives
i
dont
think
i
will
have
this
one
again
ovefall
a
nice
dubbel
you
can
find
better
butgive
it
a
try
i
wouldn¬ít
pay
over
7
for
the
bomber
don¬ít
know
the
price
but
if
in
the
56
range
grab
one
for
a
try
with
the
wax
top
methinks
its
a
pricey
beer
yet
maybe
its
because
i
know
what
im
drinking
but
in
going
after
a
distinctly
european
style
it
fails
as
many
other
things
american
do
it
lacks
the
depth
of
character
the
slight
nuance
that
the
old
school
tried
and
true
dubbels
have
but
in
going
after
that
mystique
its
a
noble
failure
if
ever
so
slightly
in
the
end
its
still
a
lovely
beer
and
aside
from
unibroue
or
ommegang
who
specialize
in
these
styles
i
cant
think
of
another
american
make
dubbel
or
double
that
almost
pulls
it
off
as
well
comment
this
is
my
second
disappointing
beer
from
anderson
valley
i
will
be
highly
unlikely
to
grab
another
highly
drinkable
for
something
that
has
enough
sugar
in
it
to
be
candy
d
an
easydrinking
dubbel
that
is
impressive
for
an
american
brewery
not
particularly
complex
but
solid
enough
however
i
dont
think
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
another
bottle
given
other
options
in
this
category
the
taste
has
the
caramel
malt
in
big
abundance
ie
its
up
in
your
face
after
another
sip
or
2
the
fruit
gets
more
assertive
with
plum
and
fig
and
i
get
some
chocolate
as
well
not
what
i
would
expect
from
an
abbey
dubbel
swishing
the
brew
in
my
mouth
theres
also
a
touch
of
sourness
and
id
have
to
say
its
a
pretty
good
tasting
interpretation
of
a
belgian
dubbel
at
this
point
but
it
could
use
a
bit
of
tweaking
a
few
more
sips
in
and
the
alcohol
becomes
more
noticeable
but
its
not
intusive
just
warms
my
tummy
a
bit
it
finishes
on
the
semi
sweet
side
and
the
aftertaste
is
on
the
short
lived
side
not
a
bad
brew
but
when
i
think
of
other
dubbels
that
ive
tried
and
enjoyed
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
the
style
by
a
fair
bit
i
think
its
the
lack
of
spiciness
flavour
was
wellbalanced
and
restrained
on
the
fruit
with
toastysmoky
malt
flavours
playing
a
large
role
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
some
strawberry
or
ripe
cherry
in
there
as
well
with
a
roasted
finish
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
brown
somewhat
cola
colored
head
which
settles
very
quickly
has
a
faint
sour
citrusy
aroma
with
hints
of
coffee
and
or
toffee
maybe
even
some
molasses
taste
is
a
bit
harder
for
me
im
detecting
possibly
some
licorice
maybe
rye
malt
a
bit
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
right
where
id
expect
it
to
be
just
the
right
amount
of
aftertaste
a
bit
sticky
perhaps
a
really
nice
mellow
not
too
sour
dubbel
a
bomber
is
probably
the
most
id
like
to
drink
in
a
sitting
but
yeah
its
good
give
it
a
try
bottle
2
a
few
months
later
revision
to
aroma
which
got
a
little
funkier
but
otherwise
the
review
stands
drinkability
its
a
good
deal
at
the
price
point
overall
a
good
dubble
but
for
a
couple
bucks
more
i
can
get
a
couple
more
oz
and
an
outstanding
dubblebelgian
strong
dark
an
easy
drinker
that
suits
the
style
well
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
a
welldone
interpretation
of
a
dubbel
worth
grabbing
next
time
youre
at
the
liquor
store
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
is
coupled
with
notes
of
chocolate
raisins
and
bready
yeast
slight
alcohol
notes
cause
the
mouth
to
pucker
just
a
bit
an
admirable
double
not
the
best
interpretation
of
the
style
nor
the
worst
anderson
valley
dubbel
eh
it
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
small
white
heading
smell
was
a
bit
musty
with
some
banana
aromas
going
on
very
dunkelweizen
esq
taste
was
a
bit
on
the
creamy
side
with
some
powdery
notes
and
more
on
the
light
fruit
good
enough
for
me
on
the
mouthfeel
medium
and
highly
drinkable
this
one
doesnt
quite
compare
to
other
examples
of
the
style
such
as
from
allagash
or
some
of
the
other
greats
but
having
said
that
i
love
this
style
and
this
one
is
satisfying
as
far
as
i
can
tell
i
can
also
say
for
sure
that
anderson
valley
is
one
of
my
favorite
west
coast
breweries
cheers
drinks
easy
enough
an
allright
dubbel
not
much
complexity
or
funkyness
note
after
i
started
looking
at
some
more
reviews
i
noticed
that
the
newest
ones
tend
to
be
higher
for
this
beer
maybe
they
made
some
recipe
or
process
engineering
changes
in
the
production
of
this
one
maybe
you
should
give
it
another
try
peoplewhosaiditwashorrible
pours
a
darker
brown
color
with
ruby
hues
its
clear
and
also
appears
flat
with

at
all
an
aggressive
whiff
of
alcohol
leaves
the
glass
at
first
followed
by
figs
and
raisin
beneath
the
sweetness
of
the
first
layer
you
can
really
smell
rich
malt
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
is
immediate
and
slightly
overpowers
the
creamy
malt
flavor
there
is
a
slight
hop
and
a
bit
of
carbonation
to
the
mouth
feel
this
is
one
im
going
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
a
respectable
beverage
for
the
price
drinkability
there
are
some
pros
and
cons
to
this
beer
and
that
is
disappointing
from
a
brewery
as
good
as
anderson
valley
if
they
cant
pull
off
a
top

belgian
they
should
stick
with
what
they
do

it

a
noticeable
warming
due

one

you

doesnt

a

its

minimal

flavor
is
a
heavy
malt
taste
with
some
sweet
grape
on
top
i
detect
very
little
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
very
tangy
and
has
some
nice
touches
of
warming
alcohol
the
carbonation
is
fizzy
and
everlasting
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fine
example
of
the
style
pretty
authentic
for
an
american
take
on
an
abbey
brew
i
think
the
problem
is
that
is
lacks
consistency
one
sips
great
while
another
is
average
definitely
worth
a
buy
not
as
huge
a
fan
of
this
beer
as
i
was
initially
but
still
would
pick
it
up
again
drinkability
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
yard
house
in
long
beach
last
weekend
and
loved
it
ill
review
it
on
tap
next
time
to
compare
because
this
doesnt
seem
like
the
same
beer
at
all
based
upon
that
as
well
as
wild
fluctuation
in
the
other
reviews
of
this
beer
im
led
to
believe
there
are
some
issues
with
consistency
regardless
its
very
good
and
living
in
a
mighty
shadow
it
costs
half
of
what
a
real
trappist
does
and
tastes
about
half
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
at
least
not
bad
but
not
great
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
mouth
chocolate
and
bananas
mmm
some
warmth
in
the
exhale
that
leaves
a
lasting
tart
cherry
flavor
behind
finishes
with
a
bubble
gum
taste
carbonation
is
nice
and
fizzy
all
the
way
through
this
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogny
with
a
smallish
white
the
smell
is
weak
with
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
malt
the
taste
is
all
alcohol
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
not
bad
but
i
expected
more
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
mix
pretty
wellnot
great
this
is
an
ok
beer
average
double
i
really
expected
more
from
a
brewery
like
anderson
valley
i
really
didnt
like
this
one
too
much
ive
had
a
few
belgian
dubbels
and
have
enjoyed
them
all
immensely
so
even
though
this
one
is
not
actually
brewed
in
belgium
i
expected
to
get
something
similar
nope
this
one
pretty
much
sucked
picked
this
up
along
with
the
a
four
pack
and
a
750
of
thelonius
monks
ale
for
only
15
bucks
cant
beat
that
once
again
people
go
buy
beer
at
the
six
pack
store
in
moon
if
your
in
the
pittsburgh
area
not
the
most
in
depth
selection
but
deals
are
everywhere
bottle
is
rubber
sealed
with
black
wax
looking
polymer
and
it
pours
a
deep
caramel
ruby
tone
with
a
lucious
tan
head
leaves
fine
streaks
of
lacing
aroma
contains
hints
of
coffee
and
anise
notes
with
an
overall
vinous
appeal
touch
of
powdered
cocoa
and
some
caramel
toffee
malt
tones
as
well
taste
has
a
great
mix
of
tart
apple
raisin
going
on
with
soft
chocolate
and
toffee
sweetness
herbal
hop
bitterness
is
mild
and
blended
well
bready
tone
not
the
best
overall
american
brewed
dubbel
ive
had
but
it
does
the
trick
tasty
22oz
portion
mouthfeel
is
creamy
carbonation
is
smooth
but
by
no
means
effervescent
smooth
going
down
even
coats
the
palate
definitely
classified
as
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
solid
not
something
i
would
go
for
over
a
true
belgian
but
definitely
something
that
i
enjoyed
taste
is
on
the
simple
side
but
carmel
yeast
and
fruit
creates
a
nice
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beverage
raisinlike
sweetness
is
pleasant
without
fatiguing
the
pallete
body
could
be
bigger
and
some
extra
complexity
would
make
for
a
delicious
beer
on
the
palate
is
an
offtoffy
taste
with
a
caramel
chew
flavor
some
unpleasant
alcohol
is
present
and
this
finish
is
on
the
weak
side
for
an
abbey
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
appetizing
worth
trying
if
presented
before
you
but
not
worth
seeking
out
especially
at
the
premium
price
for
the
large
waxed
bottle
disappointing
overall
a
decent
double
that
wasnt
too
adverturious
i
nice
dinner
sipping
beer
drinkability
its
a
good
5
dubbel
and
a
fine
example
from
boonville
d
high
id
almost
call
this
a
dubbel
light
if
it
had
the
yeast
sediment
it
would
have
a
lot
more
character
but
as
it
is
it
pairs
quite
nicely
with
some
bbq
chicken
very
approachable
i
think
it
was
worth
the
try
not
bad
and
i
finished
the
bottle
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
d
good
but
not
great
easy
to
drink
despite
the
sweetness
but
not
terribly
interesting
drinkability
was
very
good
for
8
50
abv
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
whole
bottle
a
nice
break
from
the
superhopped
beers
i
usually
go
for
the
taste
brings
to
mind
those
same
dark
berries
a
dash
of
wine
nuttiness
a
bit
of
coffee
like
bitterness
followed
by
a
slight
sourness
id
like
to
add
that
in
many
cases
when
american
breweries
try
and
brew
a
belgian
style
it
seems
to
be
a
clone
of
another
beer
in
this
case
this
beer
is
very
unique
and
i
applaude
that
the
taste
is
good
not
great
but
i
score
extra
just
for
the
boldness
in
trying
to
give
us
bas
something
new
i
wouldnt
mind
aging
one
of
these
and
seeing
what
unfolds
taste
wise
strangely
sugary
to
the
nose
and
fairly
lopsided
in
flavor
it
has
its
perks
but
lacks
a
desireable
amount
of
mysterious
complexities
brother
davids
is
a
more
than
respectable
attempt
at
a
true
belgian
dubbel
in
fact
i
dont
remember
too
many
other
american
versions
that
ive
thought
as
highly
of
anderson

has
a
winner

oaky
came
to
mind
at
first
but
as
i
continued
to
sniff
i
sensed
burnt
sugar
and
malt
as
for
taste
sweetness
predominated
reminding
me
of
burnt
sugar
molasses
and
raisins
though
the
alcohol
was
also
up
front
and
there
was
a
slight
hop
tang
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
after
swallowing
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
noticed
that
alcohol
warmth
as
for
the
mouthfeel
i
thought
it
felt
a
little
bit
slick
with
below
average
carbonation
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
tremendously
drinkable
it
took
me
awhile
to
finish
half
the
bottle
i
split
it
with
a
friend
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again

finds
with

brooklyns

drinkabilitywise
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
brew
alcohol
is
way
sneaky
and
its
just
so
tasty
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
a
pretty
good
job
mouthfeel
drinkabililty
this
is
a
full
bodied
lightly
carbonated
beer
the
alcohol
seemed
well
incorporated
in
the
beer
this
was
definately
better
than
the
triple
all
in
all
i
would
recommend
a
try
and
another
good
product
from
a
quality
brewery
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
creaminess
and
stable
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
with
no
real
note
of
the
9
alcohol
content
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
tasty
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
a
nice
job
on
an
american
brewed
dubbel
thanks
to
goodbyeohio
for
the
opportunity
here
not
at
all
craveworthy
i
saw
this
on
the
shelf
at
my
local
store
and
grabbed
it
as
i
had
never
seen
it
before
i
was
hoping
to
have
found
a
deal
on
a
belgian
style
brew
for
a
fraction
of
the
cost
but
alas
was
disappointed
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
as
this
was
far
too
unbalanced
for
my
palate
very
sweet
but
with
zero
complexity
to
balance
it
out
very
little
carbonation
this
was
very
close
to
drinking
soda
fountain
syrup
cant
recommend
this
at
all
this
isnt
awful
but
its
not
good
for
the
style
the
offtastes
and
alcohol
dominate
still
a
good
beer
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
in
a
quality
style
from
a
quality
brewery
maybe
the
triple
will
be
better
not
my
favorite
of
this
particular
style
but
its
still
pretty
decent
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
their
triple
d
very
drinkable
would
buy
again
and
again
another
excellent
brew
from
anderson
valley
its
a
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
live
up
to
the
style
the
verdict
situational
if
i
were
reclining
in
a
generic
pub
in
times
square
in
a
state
of
refined
intoxication
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
and
savor
a
brimming
goblet
if
however
i
happened
to
be
relishing
westmalle
tripel
at
vol
de
nuit
i
wouldnt
want
to
remember
this
milquetoasts
ale
existed
ciao
drinkability
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
makes
it
a
bit
to
much
for
a
regular
goto
beer
but
worth
a
try
i
like
this
beer
gonna
have
to
get
some
more
lovely
smooth
dark
and
good
lace
yeastylots
of
chocolate
malt
and
carmel
and
toffee
not
too
sweet
apple
cocoa
and
moderate
use
of
spice
suitable
carbonation
an
ale
that
could
convert
ones
mates
to
craft
beer
very
quaffable
medium
mouthfeel
the
taste
was
sweet
with
carmel
and
fruitiness
some
spice
flavors
not
as
much
as
i
would
have
liked
i
expected
some
more
in
a
dubbel
it
did
have
a
nice
hop
bitterness
to
it
that
was
blended
well
with
the
alcohol
flavors
and
wamring
taste
of
brown
sugar
as
well
not
as
complex
as
some
other
dubbels
ive
had
but
not
bad
or
undrinkable
by
anymeans
it
had
a
slightly
watery
consistency
to
it
as
well
overall
not
true
to
style
but
a
decent
beer
this
belgian
dubbel
poured
into
a
tulip
formed
a
dark
brown
with
some
lacing
and
moderate
head
spicy
phenolic
with
a
huge
alcohol
splash
fruity
but
subtle
mostly
rasinplum
i
enjoyed
the
bitterness
in
the
profile
this
one
lingered
more
than
most
the
sweet
balance
was
laid
back
and
welcomed
light
mouthfeel
i
was
impressed
with
the
body
nice
its
a
shame
i
like
barney
flats
a
lot
its
a
classic
american
oatmeal
stout
belgian
beers
are
not
this
brewerys
specialty
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
redbrown
color
with
a
12
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
some
roasted
barley
and
maybe
some
chocolate
malts
its
warm
and
yeasty
zing
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malty
flavor
that
has
hints
of
raisins
and
figs
it
has
multiple
malts
including
pale
crystal
and
roasted
along
with
slight
chocolate
hint
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
great
i
like
the
malt
bill
and
aroma
as
well
as
the
warmth
notes
first
tastes
were
not
impressive
i
guess
as
the
alcohol
sinks
in
since
it
becomes
much
more
drinkable
its
drinkable
but
not
very
extraordinary
after
dropping
almost
5
on
this
bottle
i
dont
know
when
or
how
often
ill
be
reaching
for
this
one
drinkability
well
if
you
like
waking
up
naked
in
a
ditch
in
mexico
great
just
so
massive
basically
an
imperial
dubbel
this
is
the
baddest
dubbel
around
just
a
bad
muthascratcha
still
quite
true
to
the
style
and
so
much
better
than
the
accident
with
fatalities
that
is
their
tripel
if
you
think
youve
had
dubbels
this
is
the
dropped
gauntlet
good
luck
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
if
i
were
committed
to
drinking
dubbels
for
a
night
i
would
order
something
with
a
more
traditional
mouthfeel
for
the
next
round
a
lot
more
balanced
and
palatable
than
the
triple
at
best
the
drinkability
of
this
is
average
it
is
an
ok
beer
but
not
worth
the
7
i
paid
for
the
bottle
save
your
money
and
find
a
la
chouffe
after
drinking
the
david
tripple
a
few
weeks
ago
this
one
is
a
bit
lesser
in
profile
it
looks
similarly
maybe
a
little
darker
brown
with
some
burgundy
highlights
light
tan
head
rises
up
above
active
carbonation
smells
malty
lightly
toasty
raisoney
and
pruneey
tastes
similarly
but
add
in
dates
figs
hazel
nut
cloves
cinnemon
and
other
sweet
spices
low
hop
flavor
but
moderate
esters
from
fermentation
is
my
guess
tingly
to
the
palate
because
of
carbonation
and
warmingphenolic
alcohol
sweet
and
dry
to
the
finish
nice
beer
overall
but
try
this
one
before
the
tripple
a
little
sweet
but
without
the
usual
belgianiness
that
counteracts
it
so
overall
a
disappointing
beer
i
usually
love
anderson
valley
but
this
is
a
disappointment
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
xmas
beer
very
sweet
not
exactly
what
i
would
expect
for
a
double
but
extremely
enjoyable
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
come
across
it
too
bad
i
didnt
opt
for
a
growler
size
oh
well
theres
always
next
time
the
taste
is
one
of
sweet
dark
crystally
sugary
malt
it
is
probably
the
sweetest
dubbel
i
have
ever
had
even
so
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
bomber
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
coating
much
like
the
tripel
from
this
brewery
that
i
just
reviewed
i
would
gladly
have
another
if
my
budget
would
permit
i
will
seek
more
of
this
to
cellar
for
a
short
time
i
would
definitely
put
one
of
there
beers
away
for
a
year
and
see
what
happens
i
think
it
would
make
a
world
of
difference
well
this
is
better
than
their
tripel
at
least
overall
a
pretty
good
effort
at
the
style
but
the
achievement
is
just
that
poured
a
slightly
murky
dark
brown
some
yeast
phenols
in
the
aroma
candy
sugar
sweetness
in
reasonable
context
wants
to
go
syrupy
but
hangs
back
fortunately
abv
is
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
no
harsh
or
hot
alcohol
notes
finish
is
mild
with
lingering
bittersweetness
pours
with
a
onefinger
light
tan
head
fades
slowly
but
leaves
little
lace
deep
clear
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium

starts

with

finish

actually
competes
with
a
good
belgian
double
6

for
a
22oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
it
feels
good
a
little
dry
a

thin
but
still
soft
pours

dark

mahogony
out
of
a
1
pt
6
oz
bottle
little
head
taste
is
of
raisins
bread
and
a
burning
alcohol
sensation
very
sweet
and
sugary
almost
reminicient
of
a
paulner
salvator
or
celebrator
brown
sugar
alcohol
taste
is
very
prominent
making
this
very
difficult
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
alcohol
makes
this
a
sipping
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
for
this
heavy
taste
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
one
again
this
is
much
better
than
the
horrible
triple
from
avbc
but
its
still
quite
rough
around
the
edges
its
too
potent
for
the
style
it
feels
like
a
chore
drinking
this
one
the
herbal
hops
have
no
place
in
this
style
of
brew
and
throws
it
completely
out
of
balance
the
body
is
full
rich
malt
in
the
mouth
but
it
also
seems
at
bit
watery
when
i
swallowed
odd
theres
some
orange
zest
and
a
light
spicy
bitterness
but
not
in
any
abundance
a
bit
more
hoppiness
would
go
a
long
way
to
improve
this
brew
a
taste
and
breath
of
dark
rum
lasts
throughout
ended
up
being
a
drain
pour
and
upon
reflection
the
aftertaste
reminded
me
of
vulcanized
rubber
like
a
tire
or
something
seemed
similiar
to
the
smell
from
the

there
must
have
been
some
sort
of
contamination
there
from
their
packaging
im
picky
when
it
comes
to
dubbels
i
prefer
tripels
so
its
not
outstanding
by
my
book
decent
enough
and
would
serve
well
as
a

on
a

i
have
no
idea
when
this
thing
was
made
but
i
would
say
skip
it
it
is
cool
to
find
this
on
tap
in
a
beer
bar
in
bellingham
pours
raisin
brown
with
that
nice
old
fruit
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
big
and
slighlt
young
with
an
odd
metallic
twang
to
the
finish
i
would
love
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
to
put
down
in
the
cellar
as
all
the
requisite
construction
is
there
for
a
very
good
double
i
do
think
that
it
is
a
great
sign
that
brewers
who
have
no
previous
belgian
brewing
experience
can
make
these
styles
well

with

the

clean

drinkable
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy

mostly
thin
for
the

hops
bring
some

it
is

not

nice
stab
at
the

pretty

deep
amber

mahogany
in

it
poured
very
clear
from
the
very
slight

that
settles
to
virtually
no

the
nose
has
roast

a
distinct
licorice
character

a
mild

the
taste
is
a
toffeefiggy

the
licorice

is
very
slight
almost
non

the

are
just
an
accent
more
citrus
in

profile

there

the

that
is

aroma

malt
develops
a
biscuity
character
in
the

followed
by
more
dark

and
a
nice

alcohol
contributes
a
bit
of
spice
to
the

fairly
wellcarbonated
leading
it
to
feel
a
bit
light
in
the

all
in

a
pretty

if
not
terribly
exciting
definitely
a
step
up
over
their

the

the

its

flows
almost
silklike
across
the

once
it
warms
the

almost
exactly
as
the
nose
indicates
it
may
be
it
starts
with
a
combination
of
dark
fruit

malt
warms
a
little
to
reveal
some
sweeter

as
some

a
very

try

belgian
style
by
anderson

i
want
to
try
their
tripel
now
its
a
nice
dubbel
not
to
bad
and
quite
drinkable
for
the
9
alcohol
drinkability
¬ñ
this
one
wasn¬ít
that
bad
but
it
certainly
needs
a
lot
of
work
it¬ís
a
complicated
style
though
so
kudos
to
av
for
taking
a
decent
stab
at
it
22oz

a
dark

with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
long
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on

the
aroma
is
chocolate

coffee
with
some
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
the
chocolate
and
coffee
being
the
most
prominent
with
some
raisin
in
the
back
has
nice

drinkability
is
good

this
one
poured
an
amber

the
nose
is

sweet
raisins
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
the
background
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
a
nice
blend
between
chocolate
coffee
and
raisins
not
a
flavor
combination
i
would
have
put
together
myself
but
not
bad
at
all
the
feel
is
right
at
moderate
with
a
little
bit
of
creamy
texture
the
beer
is
built
well
a
really
nice
take
at
a
dubbel
by
an
american
brewery
bang
zap

it¬ís
interesting
that
the
label
spells
the
word
¬ëdouble¬í
a
departure
from

incredibly

just
¬ìso

notes
i
think
this
beer
would
be
well
served
by
aging
for
six
months
to
a
year
to
balance
and
mellow
out
the
alcohol

out

still

seem

fairly
tasty
nice

could
it
be
a

that
i
liked
i
did

this
brew
it
poured
a

head
retention
was
good
and
lacing
just
o
k
typical
spicy

taste
was
very
complex
started
off
very
smooth

malty
after
that
the
spicy

started
to
appear
not
overpowering
like
some
belgians
though
hints
of
plums
and
raisins
maybe
prunes
good
malt
base
tingly
mouthfeel
drinkable
due
to
the
complexity
of
this
ale
i
guess
dubbel
is
my
favorite
belgian
style
not
bad
sugars
are
definitely
present
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
a
little
plain
but
solid
its
a
relatively
heavy
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
too
sharp
for
my
tastes
but
the
beer
hides
its
alcoholic
content
well
and
stays
pretty
drinkable
taste
hrmm
this
is
a
bit
disappointing
theres
an
unremitting
sourness
that
takes
over
the
malt
there
isnt
the
luxurious
softness
and
malty
depth
i
expect
in
a
dubbel
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
and
a
little
metalic
tasting
the
sugaryness
isnt
even
that
striking

could
be

bad

i
screwed
up

and
got
a
decent

cake
floating
in
the
glass
but
not
a
big
deal
aroma
very
fruitforward
fresh
grapes
plums
and
oranges
along
with
sweet
bread
and
spicy
phenols
that
evoke

and

palate
complex
and
includes
some
interesting
flavors
even
in
the
world
of
ester
and
fusel
hurling
belgian
yeast
strains
starts
fruity
with
the
aforementioned
grapes
citrus
and
something
even
sweeter
like
classic
belgian
yeast
bubblegum
blackcurrants
a
hint
of
sour
cherry
then
moves
into
dark
dried
fruit
territory
with
dates
and
raisins
marmalade
cola
and
anise
spice
flavors
emerge
and
the
whole
package
is
backdropped
by
brown
sugar
thickish
but
smooth
body
that
is
maybe
a
bit
lighter
than
some
other
dubbels
moderate
carbonation
that
allows
the
flavors
to
all
peak
though
and
overall
impression
is
lowkey
sweet
malts
fruit
and
some
unique
spice
flavors
solid
offering
onot
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
still
a
very
solid
beer
this
a
warm
fruity
and
spicy
little
dubbel
it
has
a
the
rich
flavor
of
anise
but
it
doesnt
overpower
the
dark
fruits
are
rich
but
not
too
sweet
and
the
brown
sugar
in
this
is
terrific
and
restrained
the
body
of
the
beer
is
firm
with
plenty
of
bread
and
the
lightness
it
has
in
the
malt
is
deceptive
to
the
palate
you
are
expecting
a
huge
heavy
sweetness
and
then
it
glides
like
as
if
on
air
instead
worthwhile
and
smart
pours

on
the

there
is
a
mild
amount

bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
solid
dark
fruit
and
spice
presence
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
overall
not
as
good
as
the
big
trappist
dubbels
but
this
is
unique
in
its
own
eay
and
can
hold
its
own
as
a
belgian
i
would
reccomend
especially
if
you
like
te
really
overripe
fruit
and
cherry
taste
very
good
dubbel
this
one
seemed
to
have
evolved
nicely
overtime
to
be
more
complex
and
round
it
has
just
5
months
before
expiration
date
good
beer
for
your
buck
o
i
wish
that
this
beer
could
have
delivered
on
the
flavor
what
it
does
on
the
aroma
it
was
much
less
intense
than
i
was
expecting
and
the
flavors
overall
all
feel
a
bit
muddles
and
muted
that
being
said
it
is
a
very
decent
beer
and
worth
picking
up
really
good
goes
down
almost
too
easily
but
im
complaining
about
that
o
very
good
but
then
what
do
i
expect
with
a
belgian
beer
one
of
the
better
dubbels
i
havent
paired
this
one
with
food
yet
but
i
imagine
it
would
go
well
with
a
summer
or
an
italian

more
refreshing
than
other
abbey
ales
and
with
great
balance
sweetbitteralcohol
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
feel
rewarded
to
have
chosen
out
of
the
many
other
great
belgian
doubles
on
the
shelf
balanced
lively
full
of
flavor
and
easily
drinkable
for
the
abv
nice
work
affligem
i
will
look
for
your
name
in
the
future
sweetness
up
front
which
gives
way
to
the
dark
fruit
theres
a
medicinal
quality
to
the
taste
which
is
eh
a
good
but
not
exciting
flavor
on
this
dubbel
it
is
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
o
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
ever
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
dubbel
pours
reddish
brown
and
hazy
thin
head
smells
sweet
like
bread
taste
has
a
mild
sour
note
and
low
hop
profile
body
is
light
not
watery
but
light
and
with
decent
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
the
finish
and
the
body
are
limiting
factors
here
d
a
traditional
belgian
dubbel
that
tastes
and
feels
just
like
it
should
ive
always
enjoyed
dubbels
ever
since
i
first
got
into
craft
beer
and
this
is
yet
another
i
enjoyed
a
great
deal
this
brew
offers
up
a
degree
of
complexity
drinkability
and
flavor
that
i
really
enjoyed
o
a
pretty
good
dubbel
not
the
best
ive
had
by
a
long
shot
but
still
worthy
of
a
purchase
doa
o
not
even
close
to
the
best
dubbels
i
have
had
affligem
dubbel
750ml
bottle
storm
chasers
get
ready
for
the
thunderhead
of
suds
that
will
form
on
top
of
translucent
mahogany
brown
brew
just
as
big
as
the
head
the
aroma
lets
you
know
there
is
a
big
dubbel
waiting
for
you
as
things
settle
when
you
finally
venture
to
take
the
face
shot
of
foam
searching
for
some
beer
below
you
will
be
greeted
with
big
caramel
and
brown
sugar
flavors
and
a
smooth
drinking
experience
this
is
as
fine
a
dubbel
as
any
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
that
is
more
of
a
comment
on
dubbels
in
general
rather
than
of
the
affligem
which
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
overall
a
concoction
that
is
developed
to
satisfy
every
taste
bud
that
appreciates
what
fine
beer
is
supposed
to
be
made
treat
yourself
grab
a
glass
and
watch
little
tv
youll
will
definitely
not
be
disappointed
salud
o
a
great
dubbel
the
nose
was
the
highlight
for
me
but
everything
about
it
is
solid
impressively
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
definitely
something
to
seek
out
overall
an
addictive
beer
the
taste
is
so
interesting
and
yet
undefinable
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
a
super
large
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
very
good
lacing
aroma
of
caramelized
sugar
and
fruity
ester
is
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
caramelized
sugar
with
solid
malt
backbone
and
some
fruity
ester
there
was
a
light
metallic
taste
that
i
could
have
done
without
but
it
was
quite
subtle
body
is
about
average
with
nice
creamy
texture
and
great
carbonation
with
no
apparent
alcohol
not
the
most
overly
complex
example
of
the
style
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
my
god
in
true
belgian
style
this
beer
just
bursts
with
smell
and
flavour
it
also
pours
beautifully
leaving
a
nice
thick
head
that
has
great
retention
although
no
lacing
its
a
reddish
brown
that
screams
malt
and
this
is
exactly
what
you
get
when
you
smell
it
mixed
of
course
with
the
characteristic
belgian
yeast
smell
maybe
even
a
hint
of
cherry
damn
this
stuff
is
tasty
the
cherry
really
shines
through
in
the
taste
as
does
the
malt
which
is
almost
perfectly
balanced
by
the
light
hops
it
has
a
nice
dry
wellcarbonated
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
overall
this
has
a
unique
tasteconsistency
to
it
its
a
nice
switch
up
from
all
the
overdone
american
crafts
ive
had
lately
decently
priced
alright
availability
i
think
if
this
were
aged
for
at
least
6
months
to
a
year
it
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
to
mellowbalance
the
booze
taste
d
i
like
this
one
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
o
i
was
thrown
off
by
the
reviews
on
this
site
but
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
i
will
get
again
for
its
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
st
bernardus
prior
8
and
the
westmalle
dubbel
each
to
their
own
i
guess
d
a
tasty
dubbel
that
im
finding
quite
easytodrink
result
of
lighter
body
maybe
not
quite
brown
sugar
forward
but
more
of
a
refreshing
tropical
fruit
focus
would
definitely
recommend
o
not
your
standard
dubbel
and
actually
quite
a
complex
brew
showing
that
industrial
bewing
does
not
necessarly
means
flat
and
boring
nicely
drinkable
maybe
just
a
bit
too
much
on
the
malty
side
to
be
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
very
nice
pricequality
ratio
o
a
tasty
dubbel
and
certainly
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
would
need
to
pack
a
bit
more
flavour
into
this
one
to
make
it
world
class
overall
just
a
run
of
the
mill
dubbel
for
me
not
much
complexity
to
the
beer
at
all
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
definitely
lighter
than
a
quad
but
not
so
light
that
you
feel
something
is
missing
or
lacking
reasonably
priced
ive
had
this
a
few
times
before
but
tonight
is
the
first
time
reviewing
it
and
i
have
to
wonder
why
dont
i
buy
this
more
often
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
poured
a
dark
rubymahogany
with
a
lighter
brown
to
offwhtie
head
decent
clarity
in
the
body
moderate
lacing
and
some
retention
of
good
thickness
nose
has
some
lightly
dried
and
dark
fruits
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
taste
is
fairly
dry
as
well
dark
breads
mild
vinous
notes
and
more
dried
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
again
with
pronounced
spice
and
yeast
notes
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
chewiness
moderate
and
restrained
carbonation
that
works
well
for
a
beer
of
this
style
decent
if
a
somewhat
plain
dubbel
not
exemplary
but
pleasing
overall
good
beer
definantly
pick
one
up
and
add
it
to
your
cellar
o
i
taste
quality
but
its
a
strange
one
weird
mix
of
flavors
and
weird
flavors
more
interesting
than
enjoyable
o
ive
never
encountered
a
dubbe
like
this
maybe
its
me
who
knows
but
the
licorice
is
definitely
a
new
flavor
for
the
style
o
okay
but
leaving
a
flat
impression
overall
its
a
decent
take
on
the
style
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
much
and
it
will
be
a
little
hard
to
remember
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
of
these
but
ill
likely
opt
for
other
dubbels
first
o
quite
nice
beer
but
a
poor
excuse
for
a
dubbel
the
overall
impression
is
really
good
ive
had
many
a
dubbel
and
though
my
favorite
is
still
probably
the
chimay
red
this
one
really
gives
it
a
run
for
its
money
complex
and
rich
with
a
great
spicy
phenol
profile
and
a
much
more
substantial
feeling
body
less
carbonation
not
a
session
brew
but
a
near
perfect
coldnight
beer
in
my
books
lively
biting
carbonation
feels
fairly
light
fairly
complex
enjoyable
dubbel
overall
enjoyable
but
not
particularly
good
dubbel
pales
in
comparison
to
a
westmalle
or
an
ommegang
decent
beer
but
no
reason
to
buy
it
if
you
can
get
one
of
the
others
an
agreeable
enough
dubbel
a
little
too
cozy
with
the
sweetness
perhaps
but
with
plenty
of
things
going
on
otherwise
to
render
this
nice
and
drinkable
and
more
than
enjoyable
after
all
the
thinkin
and
appraisin
is
well
and
done
od
could
do
with
less
spice
and
more
fruity
malt
notes
its
an
alright
dubbel
but
not
a
hair
raiser
respectable
but
not
world
class
in
any
way
overall
a
very
well
crafted
beer
but
the
flavours
werent
my
favourite
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
but
there
are
many
other
beers
in
this
style
that
id
rather
be
drinking
rich
smooth
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
glasses
of
beer
ive
had
in
a
few
months
this
is
an
incredible
beer
that
i
would
describe
as
worth
a
try
if
not
a
musttry
to
anyone
who
purports
to
enjoy
belgian
brews
my
first
dubbel
but
definitely
not
my
last
m
viscosity
from
alcohol
is
downplayed
by
the
sugars
carbonation
is
mediumlow
overall
achieves
a
silky
feel
that
is
pleasant
even
luxurious
nice
dubbel
accessible
though
not
nearly
as
bold
in
the
flavor
department
as
i
would
like
still
nice
pickup
im
going
to
age
a
couple
bottles
see
what
happens
reddish
brown

one
finger
of
dense

sticky

nice

comes
through
also

come

moderate

soft
and

fairly

nice

good
weight
this
is
a
very
nice
dubbel
not
the
most
complex
but
its
very
flavourful
and
complimentary
good
stuff
i
am
glad
i
came
across
this
at
the
lcbo
and
will
certainly
grab
it
again
like
the
others
i
have
tried
from
this
brewer
it
is
not
overly
complex
but
it
is
certainly
a
well
crafted
brew
that
is
very
easy
drinking
really
similar
to
the
tripel
a
very
good
beer
not
quite
on
par
with
some
of
the
worlds
best
but
just
a
notch
below
them
o
this
is
just
really
really
good
a
rich
and
satisfying
dubbel
that
doesnt
come
off
the
least
bit
heavy
or
cloying
bravo
o
no
real
quirks
here
about
this
one
just
not
a
beer
that
will
take
you
over
or
turn
your
head
good
flavor
mix
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
but
nothing
to
put
it
in
a
class
of
its
own
either
try
it
if
its
convenient
for
you
from
the
wirecaged
corked
750
ml
bottle
marked
1017314
the
pour
is
somewhere
between
amber
red
and
brown
the
head
is
softly
floating
on
the
top
and
slowly
fades
away
the
belgian
sugar
and
crystal
malts
shine
on
the
nose
the
body
was
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
but
still
quite
nice
it
is
sweet
up
front
and
then
the
malts
are
clean
on
the
tongue
and
the
hops
are
soft
and
dry
nice
beer

tried
this
beer

at

mouthfeel

the
flavour
was
roasted

fairly

good
as
their

and
i
actually
prefer
dubbels
in
general
there
are
other
abbey
ales
that
i
prefer
but
it
was
well
worth
the
price
the
finish
left
something
to
be
desired
for
me
but
i
would
certainly
be
well
satisfied
if
this
was
the
only
option
available
for
an
abbey
ale
notes
great
pricequality
ratio
at
least
on
this
occasion
and
while
i
am
slightly
more
pleased
by
some
of
their
seasonal
offerings
this
affligem
is
a
good
addition
to
any
shelve
got
damn
this
stuff
has
really
mellowed
out
not
that
it
wasnt
fantastic
before
this
is
a
quintessential
belgian
dubbel
nothing
really
bowls
you
over
the
head
or
kicks
your
behind
but
it
is
really
solid
and
really
drinkable
to
tell
you
the
truth
nothing
really
blows
me
away
here
the
characteristics
of
a
belgian
dubbel
are
there
very
very
solid
not
sure
if
the
aging
has
really
done
anything
to
this
beer
however
nothing
too
discernible
paired
with
a
nice
grouyere
however
it
really
paired
well
with
the
belgian
yeastiness
of
this
beer
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
but
there
are
much
better
dubbels
readily
available
alot
of
carbonation
and
with
a
full
flavor
of
that
typical
yeast
strain
found
in
the
belgium
abbey
ales
some
floral
hints
with
a
bready
toasted
flavor
it
makes
you
want
to
stay
their
for
another
only
this
time
accompanied
by
good
conversation
to
talk
about
its
complexities
and
warm
nature
cheers
nice
drinkable
and
smokecentred
dubbel
with
an
rather
unbalanced
finish
d
yes
yes
its
decent
abv
would
make
you
think
this
is
a
sipper
but
i
could
have
a
few
its
on
my
list
for
ones
to
enjoy
more
very
appealing
without
being
overly
complex
the
dryness
does
more
for
this
beer
as
it
is
able
to
separate
itself
from
the
sweeter
dubbels
a
bit
of
an
underdog
within
its
style
and
should
be
given
at
least
a
chancewe
are
glad
we
did
picked
this
up
in
a
two
style
sampler
with
chalice
at
the
french
version
of
walmart
carrefour
in
puerto
i
liked
the
chalice
which
i
poured
the
33
l
bottle
promptly
into
and
appreciated
the
two
fingers
of
head
the
colour
is
a
tawny
brown
apparition
of
my
former
self
from
the
summer
the
smell
is
of
malts
yeast
and
berriesreminds
me
of
cranberry
bread
taste
is
sweet
with
a
background
of
warmth
from
the
6
8
abv
not
sure
when
the
7
came
in
to
play
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
effervescence
from
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
fine
but
i
have
only
found
this
in
a
four
pack
sampler
with
chalice
at
abt
10
00
usd
not
too
bad
d
pretty
good
even
though
its
not
that
strong
id
still
probably
call
it
a
sipper
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
but
the
spiciness
might
get
to
you
dnot
a
big
multilayered
brew
but
easily
drinkable
and
a
decent
example
of
the
style
notes
really
glad
that
i
kept
this
bottle
and
that
it
survived
the
trip
so
that
i
could
enjoy
it
this
evening
finishes
with
a
long
sweet
but
semi
dry
with
lots
of
lingering
belgians
malts
and
sugars

dubbel
comes
in
a
750ml
bottle
topped
with
a
champagne
style
cork
it
poured
a
hazy
honey
brownish
tan
the
head
was
a
rich
light
cork
color
the
nose
was
earthy
but
a
little
sweet
maybe
a
hint
of
hazelnut
and
some
yeast
nice
the
first
sip
is
soft
and
sweet
it
was
defiantly
hazelnut
i
was
smelling
because
it
hit
the
tongue
like
a
freight
train
there
is
some
apricot
and
tartness
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
that
add
some
balance
to
this
sweet
dubbel
some
lingering
leathery
feel
finishes
out
this
nice
belgian
beer
this
would
be
great
paired
with
a
glazed
ham
and
stuffing
maybe
a
side
of
mashed
sweet
potatoes
or
carrots
with
brown
sugar
perhaps
i
should
keep
this
beer
in
mind
for
thanksgiving
dinner
bought
this
in
a
czech
grocery
store
for
1
50
pours
out
a
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
chunky
head
that
sits
on
top
for
quite
a
while
leaving
lacing
all
over
the
glass
the
nose
is
pretty
unremarkable
malts
faint
cloves
caramel
and
a
off
putting
metallic
smell
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
more
alcohol
and
spice
bitterness
and
a
metallic
taste
that
is
a
bit
overwhelming
and
pretty
much
ruins
it
for
me
nothing
special
here
but
not
bad
for
1
50
drinkability
a
tasty
solid
and
drinkable
dubbel
this
is
a
beer
i
would
gladly
have
again
overall
this
ale
is
almost
too
drinkable
worth
a
try
at
the
very
least
im
keeping
this
as
one
of
my
favorite
belgianstyle
ales
overall
a
good
if
pretty
standard
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
definitely
worth
a
try
though
this
was
a
classic
abbey
dubbel
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
think
i
can
brew
a
better
one
myself
d
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
stand
out
among
dubbels
given
the
limited
amount
of
complexity
in
the
taste
d
subtle
and
restrained
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
very
average
dubbel
im
glad
that
ive
tasted
it
but
dont
need
to
revisit
it
when
westmalle
is
sitting
right
next
to
it
on
the
shelf
a
fairly
laid
back
dubbel
pretty
good
but
theres
nothing
here
to
really
blow
you
away
kinda
weird
kinda
pleasant
it
fails
as
a
dubbel
but
succeeds
as
an
interesting
beer
so
its
a
bit
hard
to
review
ill
say
this
im
enjoying
it
at
the
moment
but
will
probably
never
go
back
to
it
drinkability

very

nice
addition
to

d
not
a
bad
dubbel
at
all
but
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
finished
dry
i
love
it
could
easily
drink
this
for
the
rest
of
my
life
d
the
price
is
right
the
flavor
is
great
this
is
a
regular
in

rotation

drink
a
bottle
but
after
that
i
might
switch
on
to
something
elsenot
a
session
beer
huge
drinkability
potential
huge
flavor
and
fantastic
lasting
flavor
makes
this
a
dubbel
that
is
a
cut
above
others
not
to
mention
the
price
its
hard
to
beat
affligem
double
is
a
rich
shade
of
reddishbrown
as
i
pour
it
from
the
bottle
it
forms
a
thick
soapy
offwhite
lather
on
top
this
head
is
very
wellretained
but
doesnt
leave
much
lace
behind
it
smells
medicinal
also
showing
hints
of
banana
pear
raisin
and
plum
caramelized
sugar
sweet
overripe
fruit
and
an
unexpected
lemonytartness
in
the
finish
slightly
medicinal
mediumbodied
with
sharp
spritzy
carbonation
feels
light
but
not
thin
i
found
it
easy
enough
to
put
this
one
back
d
i
would
not
bother
again
good
beer
with
nothing
extraordinarily
remarkable
the
cork
is
very
nicely
decorated
but
ill
save
that
review
for
later
overall
average
beer
i
mean
considering
the
fantastic
dubbel
out
there
though
others
reviews
say
otherwise
i
believe
this
to
be
the
best
of
the
affligem
offerings
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
that
belongs
in
the
discussion
with
the
chimay
reds
and
westmalle
dubbels
d
great
beer
its
my
first
dubbel
and
i
really
enjoy
it
i
would
like
to
see
more
brought
on
in
the
flavour
department
but
it
is
good
none
the
less
also
its
worth
noting
the
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
hidden
quite
well
mouthfeel
as
stated
is
impaired
by
the
strong
carbonation
i
find
this
impacts
the
drink
and
reduces
its
drinkability
overall
yeah
this
is
good
but
far
from
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
i
have
one
more
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
well
make
it
past
the
second
date
the
body
seemed
weak
and
watery
for
6
8abv
pleasant
enough
but
lacking
in
richness
and
body
for
me
theres
definitely
some
great
things
going
for
this
beer
but
somehow
a
great
aroma
masks
a
middling
flavour
i
was
going
to
buy
a
few
to
cellar
but
i
think
ill
give
it
a
miss
d
a
very
good
dubbel
that
i
wish
had
toned
down
the
carbonation
for
better
feel
but
the
herbal
lemony
hoppiness
is
a
welcome
and
unique
characteristic
of
this
widely
available
brew
rather
straightforward
in
flavor
without
a
great
deal
of
depth
some
plum
and
black
cherry
notes
are
supported
by
a
steady
release
of
fine
champagne
like
carbonation
from
the
bottle
conditioning
the
light
color
on
the
pour
shows
itself
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
this
is
decidedly
light
in
body
for
the
style
yet
rather
pleasant
drinkabillity
is
consistent
with
the
overall
presentation
by
the
brewery
a
good
but
not
great
beer
and
not
the
best
from
the
brewery
drinkability
nothing
stands
out
on
this
beer
very
plain

d
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
nice
flavors
and
relatively
easy
drinking
pours
a
mahoganybrown
with
a
large
sandy
head
and
some
lacing
as
others
have
noted
not
much

nose
mouthfeel
is
good
but
not
great
hoppier
than
other
beers
of
this
style
finish
is
a
tiny
bit
bitter
with
some
alcohol
present
on
the
tongue
overall
slightly
disappointing
wouldnt
buy
again
as
there
are
similarly
priced
dubbels
which
are
more
satisfying
not
bad
though
as
far
as
the
taste
i
can
see
why
this
beer
gets
so
many
b
ratings
it
has
a
very
standard
dubbel
taste
maybe
even
a
little
muted
compared
to
some
still
tastes
good
though
and
is
easily
drinkable
i
dont
know
if
i
would
get
this
again
lacks
a
lot
of
the
flavors
of
other
dubbels

okay

expect

the
flavors
were
a

of
a
letdown
the
initial

was
good

there
was
some

dried

in
there
too

this

heres
a
pretty
common
belgian
its
good
but
pretty
average
my
mom
got
me
this
for
a
present
and
by
no
means
is
it
a
bad
beer
in
any
way
just
not
that
complex
however
right
now
im
pairing
it
with
some
cheeses
which
knocks
the
taste
up
to
a
4

really
which
i
why
with
this
review
i
wont
really
bother
describing
the
beer
as
others
have
done
that
this
my
i
cant
believe
how
much
the
cheese
changes
the
beer
post
some
simple
goganzola
was
amazing
with
this
as
were
some
limburger
and
french

cheese
but
the
gorganzola
paired
best
i
have
gobbled
many
of
these
and
they
get

the

i
was
surprised
that
there
was
not
more
of
a
crispness
to
this
beer
but
overall
a
good
beer
served
from
a
750ml
brown
caged
and
corked
bottle
this
poured
out
a
very
hazy
brown
with
a
supercondensed
creamy
head
that
would
not
disappear
it
reminded
me
of
something
out
of
a
nitrocan
the
aroma
had
lots
of
malt
with
a
strong
raisin
back
the
taste
mimmicked
the
raisin
aroma
and
there
was
a
really
dry
finish
i
dont
want
to
critique
this
beer
beyond
this
glass
because
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
is
a
bad
bottle
overall
since
i
am
not
a
huge
veteran
of
dubbels
this
one
will
make
me
steer
clear
of
this
style
for
a
little
bit
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy

the
moderately
sized
head

mild
aroma

tart
yeastiness
and
peppery
phenols
was
immediately
noticed
there¬ís
a
little
alcohol
present
as
a
background
aroma
but
overall
the
smell
is
faint
and
easygoing
the
taste
is
fruity
with
a
solid
malt
foundation
it¬ís
a
little
sweet
up

but
a
tartness
kicks
in
by
the
midtaste
finishes
with
a
biting
peppery
finish

enjoyed
it

think
this
was

as

impression
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
abbey
dubbels
maybe
even
better
than
some
of
the
trappists
to
me
but
very
respectable
none
the
less
perfect
for
a
crisp
autumn
night

overall
very
nice
and
refreshing
there
is
definitely
a
difference
to
the
one
without
sediment
this
one
seems
more
robust
to
the
palate
with
fruit
not
stealing
the
show
this
brew
is
just
averagely
impressive
i
was
more
impressed
by
the
unique
packaging
i
think
it
has
been
the
only
brew
i
have
drank
that
was
wrapped
in
a
paper
package
and
had
a
wire
tied
cork
on
the
bottle
thedmjul

and
spicy
alcohol
medium
to
full
in
body
and
very
smooth
and
velvety
in
texture
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
up
front
with
some
raisin
notes
followed
by
a
flavor
similar
to
chocolate
covered
cherries
some
notes
of
caramelized
sugar
and
alcohol
come
across
towards
the
finish
a
very
nice
and
complex
abbey
dubbel

good

with

of

perhaps
left
a
fine
lattice
of

i
like
the

these

use
it
might
not
be
a
top
notch
dubbel
it
is
enjoyable

say
the

the

still
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
a

big
fan
of
this
dubbel
for
the
price
a
great
dubbel
the
finish
is
odd
almost
too
bitter
but
the

is
only

so
perhaps
the
flavor
im
getting
is
something
else

flavor

malt
strong
earthy

aftertaste
with
a
combination

and

an

taste
overall
great
job
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
the
smells
and
flavored
are
tuned
up
strongly
and
in
a
good
way
it
isnt
overt
balanced
but
unique
and
delicious
it
isnt
that
often
that
i
am
impressed
enough
by
one
beer
to
be
motivated
to
check
out
a
brewerys
other
offerings
this
is
one
of
those
times
rjt
if
you
can
find
this
beer
i
would
suggest
trying
cheers
picked
this
up
to
fill
up
a
mixed
six
so
had
no
expectations
just
giving
it
a
run
decent
looking
beer
with
an
excellent
smell
the
taste
is
very
good
but
not
overly
strong
or
interesting
overall
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
sure
if
i
will
buy
in
the
future
it
will
really
depend
upon
cost
sorry
but
this
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
total
molasses
bomb
supposed
to
be
a
dubbel
but
didnt
taste
like
any
dubbel
ive
ever
had
this
was
unfortunately
a
drainpour
for
me
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
but
just
wasnt
happening
sorry
crown
valley
you
make
good
wine
but
im
still
not
sold
on
your
beer
appears
lighter
in
color
than
expected
dark
copper
colored
nice
head
of
fine
bubbles
that
stays
awhile
good
head
retention
earthy
malty
aroma
a
little
burnt
sugar
and
caramel
same
flavors
in
the
taste
good
balance
neither
sweet
nor
dry
medium
body
and
carbonation
body
could
be
fuller
overall
not
exactly
to
style
this
beer
is
a
good
take
on
the
style
although
it
tastes
a
little
young
it
is
tasty
without
being
too
heavy
overall
i
like
this
beer
mostly
malty
with
a
little
hop
i
did
find
it
a
little
thin
and
fairly
close
to
the
style
an
enjoyable
tipple
but
the
dubbel
aspect
is
getting
steamrolled
by
the
barrel
aging
easily
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
these
guys
i
only
bought
this
because
freddy
the
proprietor
at
the
biergarten
endorsed
this
he
did
me
right
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
wouldnt
classify
it
as
a
dubbelhowever
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
poured
this
new
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
amber
color
and
poured
a
really
nice
tight
packed
head
that
was
tan
in
color
the
beer
smelled
a
little
sweet
but
did
not
taste
so
alcohol
while
over
7
did
not
affect
the
taste
of
the
beer
like
sometimes
can
happen
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
for
sure
no
date
fizzy
head
leaving
some
splotchy
lacing
fairly
subdued
on
the
nose
some
sweet
dark
malty
breadiness
flavor
is
stronger
with
dark
dried
fruit
and
caramel
not
unbalanced
mouthfeel
is
bit
fizzy
but
i
may
be
drinking
this
beer
too
warm
still
a
nice
creaminess
overall
not
a
bad
dubbel
i
judge
this
one
delicious
overall
a
malt
centric
beer
that
is
pretty
straight
forward
and
easy
to
quaff
i
can
see
having
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
session
overall
4

excellent
beer
refreshing
and
at
the
same
time
nourishing
and
deeply
enjoyable
tastes
light
enough
to
be
a
pleasurable
session
beer
but
strong
enough
to
end
your
session
a
bit
early
if
you
are
not
careful
this
beer
is
delicious
and
is
highly
recommended
much
more
of
an
amber
hue
than
i
was
expecting
not
really
sure
what
i
was
expecting
actually
i
may
just
be
tired
and
thought
hey
that
is
quite
amber
nose
is
very
much
like
cheap
apple
juice
though
that
settles
and
it
is
more
candy
like
flavor
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
though
it
isnt
so
far
out
there
that
its
completely
ridiculous
there
is
a
dough
tone
to
it
that
comes
in
as
an
accent
belgian
ales
are
hard
to
pull
off
this
one
is
okay
a
bit
out
there
some
ironing
of
the
wrinkles
and
a
bit
more
definition
would
do
it
well
o
drinks
more
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
which
i
love
anyway
great
with
pringles
sour
cream
and
onion
chips
dipped
in
sour
cream
and
onion
dip
what
a
taste
sensation
i
was
gonna
kick
things
off
with
a
parody
of
spinal
taps
big
bottoms
and
some
semblance
of
brown
sugar
and
clove
finally
coming
through
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
translucent
toffee
brown
with
a
fingerlength
offwhite
head
the
carbonation
appears
to
be
immense
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
visible
from
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
head
recedes
but
a
little
remains
on
top
to
form
a
nice
cap
over
the
beer
the
lacing
seems
to
stick
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
breadiness
from
the
malts
with
some
toffee
sweetness
rising
to
the
nose
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
dark
fruit
aroma
that
is
typical
of
the
style
the
dark
fruits
that
come
to
mind
are
raisin
and
prune
the
expected
dubbel
flavor
notes
are
there
the
strong
bready
malt
backbone
is
accompanied
by
some
nice
toffee
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
flavor
i
get
notes
of
prune
and
raisin
that
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
theres
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
to
help
balance
this
beers
flavor
the
alcohol
is
pretty
wellhidden
in
the
taste
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
strong
carbonation
the
beer
finishes
very
dry
this
is
an
excellent
beer
taste
has
deep
flavors
of
raisin
and
plum
very
nice
malty
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
spicy
yeast
at
the
end
there
was
a
strong
maltiness
with
a
touch
of
yeasty
spice
a
touch
of
alcohol
warmth
a
great
sipper
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
body
crisp
and
dry
finish
despite
the
sweetness
a
very
enjoyable
brew
my
first
from
crown
valley
the
crown
cap
came
off
of
the
crown
valley
brewing
bottle
and
i
was
off
and
running
the
big
malty
nose
was
immediate
upon
commencing
my
pour
i
initially
had
two
fingers
of
tawny
head
but
it
fell
pretty
quickly
leaving
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
bright
copper
like
a
new
penny
or
one
of
my
exs
hair
with
nequality
clarity
i
really
leaned
in
for
the
nose
and
it
smelled
like
christmas
fruitcake
talk
about
truth
in
advertising
not
only
did
i
fully
get
the
raisin
and
plum
but
the
bready
malt
and
the
yeast
pulled
together
to
make
liquid
bread
in
a
way
that
i
have
not
experienced
in
some
time
mouthfeel
was
dense
and
full
and
the
dark
fruit
flavors
were
lovely
in
the
mouth
i
really
wish
that
i
could
get
some
more
of
this
one
for
the
upcoming
holiday
season
finish
was
semisweet
fruity
but
not
cloying
i
have
to
admit
that
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
and
highly
recommend
it
to
others
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12

is
strong
of
dark
fruits
taste
is
good
dark
fruits
spices
malts
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
beautiful
dark
brownamber
pour
filtered
and
clear
minimal
head
and
retention
bottle
indicates
raison
and
plum
smells
more
like
a
prune
and
the
taste
definitely
brings
that
flavor
strange
bitter
aftertaste
different
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
have
preferred
other
beers
flavored
with
raisins
extra
dry
with
a
bitter
bite
excellent
ale
one
of
my
favoites
but
at
12
00
a
six
pack
i
wont
buy
very
often
overall
not
immediately
identifiable
as
a
dubbel
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
bits
of
lacing
aroma
of
dark
fruit
including
plum
and
raisin
with
a
trace
of
spice
also
some
roasted
malt
and
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
flavor
of
plum
and
dark
fruits
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
and
touch
of
spice
medium
body
smooth
with
a
rich
feel
there
is
a
nice
warming
effect
that
goes
well
with
the
winter
season
interesting
beer
from
a
small
regional
brewer
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
seems
to
be
off
style
a
very
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
perfect
on
a
cold
winter
day
and
it
doesnt
take
to
many
before
inebriation
o
ive
had
an
entire
growler
over
the
last
few
nights
and
do
enjoy
this
beer
not
something
to
seek
out
but
worth
trying
if
you
ever
stumble
across
it
and
its
reasonably
priced
its
very
easy
to
drink
for
7
2
so
bee
careful
if
knocking
back
a
6pack
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
as
nice
to
sip
as
it
is
to
look
at
id
like
to
have
one
again
on
a
cool
night
with
a
plate
of
cheeses
the
beer
is
decent
though
it
could
use
more
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
it
also
seemed
to
have
a
hint
of
diacetyl
which
appears
to
be
a
theme
in
their
beers
but
if
it
was
there
it
was
low
enough
and
masked
by
other
flavors
that
it
wasnt
overly
offensive
one
of
their
better
offerings
but
still
not
that
impressive
o
unique
interesting
complex
great
beer
worth
a
few
more
tries
so
easy
to
put
down
the
alcohol
is
almost
indetectable
rich
in
flavor
and
aroma
an
excellent
belgianstyle
brew
o
this
beer
was
pretty
good
nothing
over
the
top
which
makes
it
a
good
everyday
drinker
the
abv
can
sneak
up
on
you
a
nice
drinker
but
i
think
it
might
be
a
little
light
for
the
style
overall
worth
trying
and
you
just
might
find
a
good
easy
going
go
to
ale
drinkability
this
was
our
first
belgian
style
beer
at
our
place
and
even
though
it
didnt
sell
worth
shit
i
would
buy
and
drink
any
night
of
the
week
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
belgian
styles
but
if
not
dont
bother
clear
pumpkinamber
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
coriander
toffee
and
fark
fruit
in
the
aroma
mildly
fruity
with
nougat
and
cocoa
powder
notes
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
and
pleasant
all
around
brew
as
ive
described
before
this
beer
sets
me
up
to
be
epic
but
then
slightly
disappoints
not
bad
though
its
pretty
drinkable
despite
the
astringency
finish
is
simple
bitter
coffee
d
the
box
it
came
in
didnt
state
what
kind
of
beer
it
was
most
breweries
that
have
big
in
the
title
usually
refer
to
its
flavor
this
one
being
a
dubbel
fell
a
little
short
not
to
say
i
dont
like
dubbels
but
i
have
to
try
one
that
really
truly
delivers
this
one
was
good
but
i
think
it
was
a
little
over
priced
12
at
afees
drinkability
if
the
price
is
right
and
it
was
for
me
then
this
beer
would
be
a
great
companion
on
a
snowy
night
i
drank
mine
while
watching
my
favorite
football
team
its
not
too
heavy
but
also
not
too
light
rather
it
settles
in
a
perfect
balance
could
easily
drink
four
or
five
without
feeling
full
d
a
very
interesting
beer
that
i
would
drink
more
of
if
i
had
it
i
stand
behind
my
assessment
that
this
belgian
dubbel
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
scottishscotch
ale
it
has
me
wondering
if
they
fermented
it
with
a
scottish
strain
of
yeast
instead
of
a
belgian
strain
either
way
its
tasty
and
malty
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
higher
abv
a
typical
american
attempt
at
a
belgian
classic
that
falls
short
in
quality
and
execution
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
crown
valley
so
far
overall
not
a
bad
beer
though
it
does
stray
from
traditional
belgian
dubbels
in
a
few
aspects
not
as
sweet
or
yeasty
as
the
classic
belgian
examples
a
little
hoppy
for
the
style
and
its
too
light
although
it
does
miss
on
these
points
its
still
a
beer
worthy
of
my
fridgespace
and
my
pallate
who
would
have
thought
a
belgian
would
come
from
a
craft
brewery
in
missouri
12
ounce
bottle
i
really
like
the
label
on
this
one
nicely
done
pours
a
rich
mahogany
with
little
to
no
head
great
color
aroma
is
of
raisin
and
fig
the
beer
presents
itself
in
a
straightforward
manner
roasted
barley
up
front
mild
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
light
bitterness
at
the
end
some
heat
in
the
finish
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
some
spiciness
abounds
throughout
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
etc
honestly
it
feels
like
it
could
benefit
from
an
infusion
of
ampedup
belgian
yeast
its
usually
one
of
the
first
things
i
taste
that
makes
a
belgian
a
belgian
and
its
just
not
here
at
least
not
a
strong
enough
presence
dont
get
me
wrong
it
tastes
good
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
i
like
in
beers
of
this
style
drinkability
is
not
good
this
makes
me
not
want
to
drink
anything
else
from
this
brewery
pretty
balanced
dubbel
but
the
palate
was
missing
a
little
carbonation
and
a
longer
lasting
malt
bill
all
in
all
pretty
good
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
of
these
as
i
wont
be
going
back
for
more
although
like
i
said
at
the
top
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
if
this
was
a
fresh
bottle
this
is
their
better
beer
pours
unfortunately
a
filtered
brown
color
the
aroma
implies
sweet
raisin
spice
and
caramel
the
taste
reveals
a
pleasant
sweet
caramel
maltiness
with
a
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spice
note
while
i
would
consider
this
a
lackluster
example
of
a
dubbel
its
still
a
good
beer
i
guess
these
guys
have
a
whole
line
of
beers
too
im
looking
forward
to
quite
a
bit
more
sampling
poured
with
a

it
this
beer
did
not
quite
meet
my
definition
of
a
belgian
dubbel
but
it
does
not
have
any
significant
faults
has
an
enjoyable
flavor
profile
and
has
a
sneaky
alcohol
heft
i
feel
like
i
have
downgraded
it
based
on
the
style
but
overall
a
nice
job
from
a
brewery
i
have
not
heard
of
d
i
found
trouble
getting
to
the
bottom
of
this
one
and
i
dont
know
what
ill
do
with
the
rest
of
my
six
pack
the
cinnamon
smelltaste
kind
of
ruined
it
for
me
smells
like
dried
fruit
and
cinnamon
tastes
similar
some
vaguely
belgian
yeast
a
little
light
on
the
aftertaste
sort
of
smokey
with
stewed
fruit
body
is
fairly
light
dry
and
spicy
in
the
finish
its
not
exactly
belgian
stylewise
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless

to
try
it
watch
out
for
the
7

its
well
hidden
overall
textbook
example
of
the
style
dubbelbsd
and
its
easy
to
see
why
it
would
rise
to
the
top
of
the
list
well
built
across
the
board
with
excellent
interplay
between
bubblegum
sweetness
spice
and
bready
malts
what
makes
this
beer
stick
out
to
me
is
the
toasty
bready
malt
finish
with
the
residual
sweetness
of
cherries
and
chocolate
it
also
helps
that
the
beer
is
not
too
sweet
like
others
in
the
style
i
made
the
mistake
of
serving
this
too
cool
at
50
degrees
serve
just
slightly
chilled
instead
so
hm
what
to
say
ive
gotten
to
the
point
where
i
dont
really
dig
malt
bombs
without
something
else
to
keep
my
interest
this
is
a
good
beer
obviously
but
it
just
doesnt
have
anything
to
balance
out
the
sweet
maltiness
and
that
isnt
my
thing
some
of
the
best

ive
ever
gotten

romania
probably
too
old
good
beer
not
worth
the
high
price
great
malt
profile
but
the
yeast
character
was
not
the
star
i
anticipated
o
this
beer
is
certainly
getting
into
the
pricey
category
for
an
11

but

is
it

had
i
wondered
why
i
never
had
reviewed
this
and
its
possible
that
i
always
went
for
its
bigger
brothers
8
and
10
if
so
my
loss
this
is
as
flavorful
and
interesting
as
those
ales
an
exceptional

from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
a
total
pleasure
to
drink

mostly
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
thick
layers
of
lacing
is
seen
that
slips
back
down
the
glass
after
the
sip
this
is
a
sipping
brew
and
not
a
chugging
type
lots
going
on
with
the
aroma
and
what
i
can
pick
out
is
spice
dark
fruits
sweet
malts
and
bread
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
taste
with
even
more
going
on
which
i
cant
really
figure
out
very
tasty
and
actually
gets
better
while
warming
up
some
smooth
with
a
slight
sweet

with
perfect
carbonation
a
pricey
brew
but
if
you
want
a
great

brew
for
this
style
then
this
is
it
its
a
10
and
is
as
good
as
it
gets
prosit
possibly
got
faulty
bottles
o
a
very
satisfying
and
appealing
beer
a
complement
to
the
style
in
a
very
positive
way
honestly
i
feel
as
though
the
complexity
here
could
be
a
bit
more
manifest
and
the
beer
itself
could
be
a
little
more
rich
and
dark
but
overall
an
outstanding
beer

overall
i
think
this
beer
could
benefit
from
softer

its
a
classic
beer
thats
been
made
the

way
for
ages
so
perhaps
its
just
not
my
cup
of

nothing
was
wrong
flavorwise
and
it
actually
paired

character

though
i
did
preferred
their
other
brews
overall
a
quality
belgian
style
i
will
continue
to
drink
it
is
not
the
8
or
the
10
but
an
outstanding
beer
very
easy
to
drink
it
went
down
very
quick
as
my
beer
guru
said
if
he
were
a
rich
man
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
in
quantity
overall
that
is
the
biggest
drawback
great
beer

maybe
not
great
enough

the
cost

not

as
the

the

bite
throws
it
off
a

and
overpowers
the
flavors
i
simply
could
not
believe
how
good
this
beer
is
it
is
so
tasty
that
i
could
only
sip
it
a

at

to
make
sure
that
it
lasted
its
like

its
amazing
to
me
how
so
many
elements
of

beer
can
be
accentuated

deaccentuated
so
much
so
in
either
way
that
it
becomes
a

in

case
of
this
beer
the
bubbles
are
out

and
dominate
way
too
much
of

a
shame
this
beer
has
many
unique
and
appealing
characteristics
but
they
are
all
overshadowed
by
that
one
thing
that
we
take
for

with

carbonation

has

some

and
overall
while
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
is
a
solid
beer
o
i
think
the
aging
has
really
improved
this
beer
not
that
i
dont
like
it
when
its
new
this
has
a
delightful
sourness
to
it

well
as
a
very
pronounce

cake
kind

taste
the
yeast
really
blends
nicely
with
all
of
the
other
flavors
this
was
just
delightful
i
wish
i
had
more

a
quickly

obviously
perhaps
the

of
the
rochefort
trio
the
balance
and
interplay
of
soft
malty
flavors
is
terrific
overall
a
good
dubbel
on
par
or
slightly
below
the
westmalle
dubbel
i
think
largely
overshadowed
by
its
bigger
brothers
rochefort
6
is
a
good
dubbel
but
falls
short
of
other
top
examples
like
westmalles
and

certainly
smell
nice

there
is

some

belgians
are
some
of
my
favorite
beers
and
this
doesnt
ever
disappoint
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
and
recommend
to
friends
i
hope
i
can
find
the
8
and
the
10
as
well
a
true
classic
for
the
style
rjt
one
of
the
three
or
four
best
dubbels
i
have
ever
tried
right
up
there
with

o
i
really
enjoyed
this
had
it
with
an
apple
and
parsnips

will
have

body
is
full
and
crisp
taste
is
of
bready
malt
spicy
yeast
plums
cherry
drying
alcohol
and
herbal
hops
finish
is
long
spicy
and
dry
wonderful
complex
brew
but
a
little
bit
too
spicy
for
me
o
decent
beer
but
not
worth
the
5
49
i
paid
for
a
single
looking
forward
to
trying
the
8
and
10s
i
have
staring
at
me
o
to
my
pure
side
this
is
missing
a
little
more
dry
bitterness
but
really
more
to
the
style
is
a
nice
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
classic
offering
that
can
be
enjoyed
and
allow
the
taste
buds
to
savor
rather
than
survive
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
some
salty
peanuts
and
fresh
kettle
corn
i
would
buy
this
again
i
just
would
have
liked
more
aroma
cheers
to
the
monks
i
know
the
beer
is
legendary
but
in
this
house
this
is
what
we
call
a
good
solid
dubbel
might
be
the
standard
that
all
others
are
judged
against
but
we
need
those
waypoints
dont
we
overall
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
gives
more
range
to
my
conception
of
the
dubbel
definitely
worth
a
try
even
if
i
might
not
return
to
this
beer
for
sometime
a
great
beer
and
pushes
my
appreciation
of
rochefort
even
higher
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
it
does
not
leave
a
coating
on
any
part
of
the
mouth
overall
very
good
dubbel
and
my
favorite
of
the
3
rochefort
beers
definitely
worth
an
occasional
purchase
o
those
monks
do
good
work
having
had
10
and
8
this
feels
quite
like
a
different
animal
8
is
much
more
fruity
and
spicy
whereas
this
has
that
drying
drinkability
a
really
nice
brew
o
i
was
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
the
aroma
was
promising
with
lots
of
fruits
and
classic
belgian
sugars
but
the
flavor
was
weak
and
lacked
complexity
admittedly
this
isnt
a
style
i
usually
enjoy
but
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
dubbels
i
generally
find
them
to
be
oddly
bland
this
has
that
same
bland
character
but
its
got
enough
complexity
and
flavor
to
rise
above
possibly
my
favorite
dubbel
in
fact
no
data
on
the
bottle
date
very
refreshing
for
750
abv
it
has
copper
colour
and
rich
long
lasting
white
head
smell
and
taste
of
caramel
cloves
candy
sugar
oranges
and
apricots
very
light
for
a
dubbel
but
i
wouldnt
say
watery
nice
beer
i
would
love
to
try
it
with
food
someone
said
lamb
stew
with
carrots
and
risotto
with
fungi
would
go
great
with
this
one
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
sizable
frothy
head
and
a
slight
beer
ring
woody
with
some
tea
and
butterscotch
woody
malt
with
plenty
of
butterscotch
and
a
little
bittersweet
licorice
earthy
and
hearty
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
now
for
the
8
and
10
odnot
really
in
my
wheelhouse
too
sweet
heats
up
the
cheeks
always
worth
trying
the
classics
but
i
didnt
really
like
this
too
much
delicious
brew
i
love
belgian
ales
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
very
dark
appearance
some
good
head
and
fruity
flavors
made
it
quite
delightful
serving
in
a
goblet
i
need
to
try
the
other
rochefort
trappiste
ales
like
number
8
and
10
for
comparison
overall
a
tasty
and
rather
enjoyable
dubbel
it
is
renowned
for
good
reason
and
one
to
go
to
from
time
to
time
o
great
full
flavor
profile
i
especially
like
how
clean
and
crisp
it
finishes
very
good
yet
i
feel
something
is
missing
to
make
this
a
great
beer
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
definitely
not
my
favorite
in
their
line
8
and
10
being
a
couple
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
but
still
very
good
no
alcohol
presence
detected
and
very
easy
drinking
a
warming
delight
overall
a
beer
that
kind
of
slips
through
your
fingers
in
a
good
way
very
complex
with
flavors
and
aromas
that
present
themselves
then
dissipate
quickly
overall

rochefort
6
does
the
name
proud
this
is
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
ever
hadtons
of
character
subtle
and
complex
beautiful
to
look
at
and
a
joy
to
have
slide
over
the
tongue
and
down
the
hatch
the
6
puts
together
the
classic
components
of
belgian
dark
alesbrown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
flavors
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
complex
yeasty
spicinessin
a
way
that
distinguishes
it
from
others
my
guess
is
the
house
yeast
used
by
rochefort
bottom
line
excellent
beer
dont
die
before
having
one
o
a
far
above
average
beer
but
id
still
classify
it
as
really
good
not
excellent
this
brew
is
savory
it
has
a
peppery
smell
and
taste
that
is
warming
interestingly
the
alcoholic
smell
calms
a
bit
as
the
drink
warms
sadly
the
drink
continues
to
mellow
and
almost
takes
on
a
watery
taste
as
the
cold
leaves
it
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
great
drink
however
its
one
of
the
few
that
ive
enjoyed
more
when
it
was
colder
i
would
probably
get
this
again
well
i
would
probably
get
the
8
or
the
10
before
this
any
day
buckeye
is
right
no
shock
there
in
that
this
is
a
lighter
example
of
the
style
no
figs
but
very
well
done
for
that
i
gotta
get
over
to
belgium
stat
if
youre
not
ready
to
dive
in
with
bigger
beers
like
westy
12
chimay
blue
and
the
like
this
is
a
good
starting
point
i
was
able
to
buy
this
doll
for
less
than
6
at
my
local
bottle
shop
absolutely
worth
checking
out
if
youre
curious
about
genuine
trappist
ale
pairs
well
with
smoked
cheeses
and
green
grapes
along
with
smoked
duck
andor
goose
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
appearance
is
probably
the
low
point
just
because
it
is
so
murky
not
to
mention
the
yeast
on
the
bottom
came
right
off
and
most
of
it
ended
up
in
the
glass
the
biscuit
and
bread
go
well
with
the
raisin
and
rum
that
start
to
show
as
the
beer
warms
o
pleasant
beer
no
more
no
less
o
great
beer
complex
pick
up
something
different
with
each
drink
o
solid
beer
very
drinkable
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
it
feels
like
a
tamer
version
of
the
10
which
is
a
favorite
overall
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
as
ive
now
had
a
10
and
an
8
while
it
lacks
the
flavor
and
intensity
of
its
older
siblings
this
is
a
damn
good
well
crafted
beer
i
could
find
myself
probably
reaching
for
a
6
more
often
though
i
still
think
the
8s
and
10
are
overall
better
beers
this
one
is
just
really
smooth
and
refreshing
lots
of
bready
malt
and
plum
this
is
a
delicious
beer
o
what
else
can
be
expected
here
its
definitely
the
lightest
of
the
rocheforts
and
knows
this
fact
yet
it
can
easily
stand
toe
to
toe
with
the
other
two
in
terms
of
complexity
just
another
excellent
trappist
offering
really
o
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
ton
of
complexity
while
staying
quite
drinkable
a
bit
too
carbonated
though
it
is
a
bit
prickly
a
great
dubbel
though
othe
bottle
i
had
was
aged
about
6
months
from
best
by
so
ill
have
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
as
this
one
seemed
a
little
off
i
really
appreciate
how
a
very
high
end
beer
is
so
readily
available
these
monks
do
an
impressive
job
with
their
brews
smells
of
juicy
dark
dry
fruit
figs
and
dates
cherries
caramel
malts
and
candy
malts
overall
just
like
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
beer
i
went
into
it
expecting
something
good
and
it
did
not
disappoint
condor
recommended
and
approved
very
good
example
of
a
good
belgian
brew
of
any
style
those
monks
know
what
they
are
doing
another
very
nice
trappist
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
i
could
easily
drink
more
of
this
but
i
only
have
one
bottle
i
love
trappist
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
o
a
musttry
remarkable
flavor
for
7
5
this
stuff
was
gone
faster
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
it
was
a
great
way
to
consecrate
my
rochefort
chalice
another
great
beer
from
rochefort
o
a
fine
belgian
dubbel
strong
and
rich
rather
bitter
not
as
good
as
the
8
or
10
but
still
pretty
tasty
prost
lampertland
at
7
5
abv
and
almost
50
cents
an
ounce
its
a
little
too
much
to
use
for
a
session
beer
duh
but
i
bet
a
bomber
of
this
would
make
for
a
damn
good
hour
or
more
if
you
could
show
the
patience
to
savor
it
honestly
im
sure
im
overrating
it
but
its
awfully
damn
good
beer
is
medium
weight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumhigh
intensity
resulting
in
a
beer
that
gradually
creates
a
mass
of
foamy
bubbles
across
the
palate
so
mouthfeel
is
foamy
and
smooth
finishes
with
a
flash
of
ethanol
heat
in
the
nostrils
leading
to
a
semidry
close
with
fairly
intense
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate

generally
a
light
bodied
fairly
dry
brew
an
excellent
dubbel
that
finishes
dry
with
plenty
of
subtle
complexity
o
a
unique
brew
with
the
herbs
and
medicinal
qualities
becoming
much
more
noticalbe
as
it
warms
its
a
sipper
and
a
terrific
stand
in
for
an
aperitif
the
carbonation
compliments
the
herbal
flavours
well
and
lends
to
the
mineral
flavours
overall
its
a
unique
drink
and
one
unparalleled
by
anything
else
ive
tried
this
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
decent
beige
head
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
sweet
malts
in
the
scent
with
yeast
and
citrus
the
taste
is
sweet
smooth
and
flavorful
there
is
the
taste
of
sugar
plums
and
other
hints
of
fruit
in
the
flavor
as
well
well
made
complex
yet
very
simple
glad
to
see
a
brewery
that
concentrates
on
just
3
beers
and
makes
them
to
perfection
i
simply
fell
in
love
for
the
rochefort
6
an
inviting
aroma
but
a
vigorously
carbonated
taste
i
was
ready
to
come
up
with
criticism
if
necessary
but
in
the
end
i
had
a
joyful
experience
that
will
definitely
be
repeated
and
in
fact
expanded
with
other
trappist
beers
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
sweet
barley
malts
dark
fruits
and
a
roasted
finish
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
o
overall
a
superb
dubbel
nothing
out
of
place
fitting
the
style
perfectly
easily
one
of
the
best
that
unfortunately
gets
overlooked
by
the
rarer
examples
probably
the
best
damn
dubbel
ive
ever
had
you
better
believe
im
buying
this
more
often
and
why
arent
you
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
it
couldnt
have
come
at
a
better
time
over
the
past
year
ive
been
trying
as
many
beers
as
i
could
get
my
hands
on
recently
ive
actually
been
getting
kind
of
bored
with
trying
different
beers
as
many
of
them
have
started
to
taste
the
same
ive
been
getting
more
and
more
underwhelmed
by
a
lot
of
the
ones
ive
tried
and
so
ive
become
more
interested
in
drinking
a
small
rotation
of
beers
that
ive
tried
and
loved
this
beer
right
here
has
shown
me
something
new
and
wonderful
and
has
given
me
a
new
sense
of
purpose
in
going
out
and
drinking
as
many
different
beers
as
i
possibly
can
i
have
a
feeling
im
going
to
be
going
through
a
lot
of
trappist
beers
in
the
near
future
ol
am
a
fan
of
dubbels
and
this
one
fell
solidly
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
for
me
the
smell
and
flavor
profiles
were
nicely
balanced
and
unique
but
a
little
underwhelming
compared
to
some
of
my
favorites
the
carbonation
was
also
a
little
heavyhanded
and
distracting
at
first
but
when
it
faded
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
the
brew
got
a
little
watery
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
high
in
light
of
the
rochefort
8
and
10
which
i
love
but
this
6
is
merely
serviceable
for
the
price
i
think
there
are
better
options
o
my
favorite
rochefort
yet
nutty
and
fruity
and
earthy
its
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
the
only
negatives
i
can
think
of
is
the
almost
nonexistant
head
and
the
high
crispy
carbonation
other
then
that
shes
glorious
o
this
is
a
great
beer
well
rounded
delicious
great
mouthfeel
cant
ask
for
much
more
cant
belive
i
never
reviewed
this
someone
strip
me
of
my
i
wanna
be

monk
card
pours
dark
brown
with
a
very
noisy
frothy
light
tan
head
that
settles
quickly
without
much
lace
smell
is
caramel
malt
some
citrus
fruits
and
a
hint
of
wood
taste
is
plums
followed
by
a
dry
woodiness
there
is
some
citrus
up
front
but
when
the
wood
hits
this
just
sounds
wrong
somehow
it
dries
out
completely
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
touch
sharp
imho
it
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
dubbel
tastes
like
the
mouthfeel
is
aggresively
carbonated
and
seems
a
bit
lighter
than
youd
expect
from
the
taste
or
the
look
overall
its
fantastic
its
only
held
back
by
the
yeast
strain
constantly
reminding
me
of
the
10
which
has
the
same
flavor
notes
but
more
complexity
but
this
is
a
great
great
example
of
the
style
o
a
light
extremely
drinkable
belgian
ale
the
flavors
blend
together
quite
nicely
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
subtle
yet
complex
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
belgian
beer
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
anything
special
at
the
end
i
could
smell
what
was
left
in
the
glass
and
i
liked
that
so
i
gave
it
a
similar
4
5
anxious
to
sample
the
10
version
from
this
series
which
is
in
the
queue
o
excellent
beer
pours
murky
copper
beer
with
excellent
absolutely
resistant
fizzy
offwhite
head
rich
aroma
of
yeasts
caramel
toffee
dark
fruits
very
good
flavour
quite
similar
to
aroma
fruity
zesty
not
very
sweet
of
course
lighter
than
other
rocheforts
good
carbonation
full
body
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
an
effervescent
level
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
dried
out
but
surprisingly
carries
plenty
of
malty
flavorings
without
the
residual
sugars
for
more
than
7
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
snappycrisp
into
the
finish
the
hop
flavoring
here
is
herbal
to
earthy
and
well
utilized
to
keep
the
alcohol
and
malt
flavors
balanced
this
is
rochefort
no
surprise
to
the
quality
here
i
couldwouldshould
drink
this
on
a
more
regular
basis
i
feel
like
this
is
a
little
less
exciting
than
the
8
and
the
10
it
pours
hazy
hand
redish
brown
not
dark
and
not
light
kind
of
dense
looking
a
very
very
robust
tan
head
than
doesnt
subside
at
all
the
nose
is
real
spicy
from
the
yeast
and
the
malt
profile
is
big
and
sweet
the
only
problem
is
the
the
flavor
doesnt
really
come
through
from
the
nose
to
the
taste
and
every
thing
is
sort
of
muted
on
the
palate
there
is
a
nice
fruity
element
to
this
one
but
all
the
flavors
are
faded
except
for
the
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
great
really
light
and
airy
for
a
beer
of
such
size
its
real
easy
drinking
and
dangerously
so
at
this
abv
im
not
sure
i
had
the
freshest
bottle
in
the
world
but
i
wasnt
amazed
by
this
overall
i
really
like
this
one
its
very
drinkable
yet
has
a
great
character
and
most
important
for
me
it
feels
really
fresh
and
not
too
sweet
a
very
balanced
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
goldencopper
color
with
a
good
sized
bubbly
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
cap
on
top
smells
of
caramel
brown
and
burnt
sugars
dark
fruits
and
yeasty
phenols
the
flavor
is
just
what
the
aroma
described
it
would
be
light
and
fruity
with
lots
of
dark
and
brown
sugars
with
some
yeasty
flavors
medium
body
with
an
insane
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
sugary
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
nice
flavorful
belgian
strong
ale
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
less
carbonation
but
i
say
that
about
a
lot
of
belgian
beers
poured
out
a
nice
mahogany
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
retained
very
well
smells
of
breadyeast
yeast
with
some
fruit
and
raisin
notes
taste
has
a
slight
breadyness
to
it
with
the
alcohol
being
hidden
very
well
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
with
a
wet
finish
not
my
favorite
would
prefer
the
10
but
still
a
great
drink
mhas
a
little
breeze
in
it
i
love
it
great
trappist
brew
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
the
flavor
profile
while
complex
worked
together
nicely
the
sign
of
a
belgian
beer
done
correctly
another
topclass
brew
excellent
profile
great
taste
incorporating
a
dynamic
and
refreshing
complexity
with
the
pleasant
maltiness
seek
it
out
o
this
is
pretty
drinkable
for
a
bsda
perhaps
a
bit
misleading
in
the
style
given
i
do
not
particularly
consider
an
apple
as
a
dark
fruit
this
is
one
to
savor
o
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
beer
with
a
steak
i
would
like
to
try
the
12
not
an
everyday
drinker
but
i
could
definitely
enjoy
this
on
a
rainy
day
o
very
easy
drinking
but
still
has
the
complexity
of
a
belgian
i
think
i
like
this
better
than
8
but
not
quite
as
much
as
10
though
the
styles
are
distinct
o
definitely
has
that
classic
trappist
ester
profile
but
this
ones
a
bit
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
overly
fizzy
overall
i
found
the
taste
to
be
more
too
onedimensional
for
me
to
rate
it
as
a
great
beer
as
opposed
to
just
a
good
one
overall
i
wish
i
liked
figs
because
this
would
be
my
favorite
beer
if
i
did
i
thought
it
was
an
exceptional
belgian
ale
and
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
recommend
it
drink
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
rocheforts
had
to
review
all
3
though
i
need
to
buy
more
10
to
sit
on
o
excellent
beer
would
be
rated
higher
if
not
for
the
head
and
lacing
problem
perhaps
i
will
reevaluate
with
a
different
bottle
at
a
later
time
i
shouldnt
have
waited
so
long
to
try
this
considering
its
price
its
not
something
i
will
have
often
but
when
i
do
it
will
certainly
be
a
treat

color
with
a
thin
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
foam
atop
the
ale
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on

but
is
still
nice
to
look
at
aromas
are
rich
with
ripe

bready

its

are
earthy

raisin

nice
meld
of

is
on

allows
the
ale
to
cover
the
palate
while
the
alcohol
warms
with
a
tingle
its
been
a
long
time
coming
but
i
finally
got
around
to
picking
this
one
up
quality
brew
from
a
quality
brewery
just
as
expected
t
opens
with
a
lot
of
malt
sweetness
freshly
baked
dark
bread
plum
and
raisin
cola
nut
banana
and
a
good
amount
of
belgian
yeast
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
definitely
not
up
there
with
the
10
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
overall
this
is
a
very
well
put
together
belgian
ale
although
this
one
is
a
tad
lighter
than
the
trappistes
8
10
from
this
brewer
now
dont
get
me
wrong
i
truly
think
they
are
all
exceptional
brews
overall
great
stuff
preferred
over
the
8
and
very
close
to
the
10
overall
a
light
and
very
drinkable
beer
given
the
abv
it
might
be
just
a
touch
too
carbonated
but
the
tastes
are
well
balanced
and
you
can
taste
the
quality
ingredients
the
rochefort
10
is
still
my
favourite
by
a
mile
though
all
in
all
a
fantastic
beer
that
still
has
room
to
improve
originally
reviewed
11082010
overall
a
very
solid
beer
from
another
brewery
this
might
be
a
flagship
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
rocheforts
other
offerings
overall
meh
ive
had
many
better
belgian
dark
ales
this
one
is
unimpressive
to
me
overall
a
very
good
authentic
dark
belgian
ale
great
mix
of
fruits
and
spices
manages
to
feel
light
without
sacrificing
taste
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
may
it
a
point
to
try
if
you
have
not
had
one
before
overall
great
trappist
beer
very
bubbly
overall
overall
rochefort
is
my
favorite
trappist
brewery
and
the
10
is
my
favorite
dark
belgian
beer
this
one
is
a
bit
lighter
particularly
for
the
bsda
style
but
it
is
still
an
exceptional
product
overall
wow
this
is
it
this
is
my
beer
the
flavors
the
cohesion
it
all
really
comes
together
to
surprise
and
delight
its
fitting
that
this
is
made
at
a
monastery
because
its
as
close
to
religion
as
i
get
sadly
heaven
aint
cheap
and
at
almost
6
a
bottle
rocheforts
only
losing
point
vanquishes
it
to
only
special
occasions
if
youre
feeling
special
spend
the
cash
and
delight
yourself
o
a
nice
trappist
offering
i
do
enjoy
the
8
and
10
better
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
o
its
a
great
beer
a
sipper
a
treat
and
an
absolute
classic
this
is
my
first
of
the
rochefort
series
this
beer
pours
a
nice
mahogany
reddish
brown
color
with
some
nice
carbonation
streaming
from
the
bottom
the
head
is
off
white
fluffy
with
big
bubbles
but
recedes
very
quickly
and
leaves
a
few
spots
of
bubbles
on
the
top
of
the
headless
beer
aroma
is
of
nice
caramelized
figs
a
bit
of
dark
stone
fruits
and
some
nice
raisin
spicy
like
notes
pretty
complex
and
interesting
perfect
with
my
short
ribs
i
prepared
earlier
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aromas
a
tad
thin
for
me
but
very
true
to
the
style
the
plum
fig
and
roasted
caramel
notes
play
nicely
but
its
a
touch
thin
for
me
so
this
feels
a
little
fake
i
also
get
a
touch
of
grape
maybe
some
red
wine
like
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
maybe
a
bit
too
over
carbonated
for
me
actually
but
refreshing
with
each
sip
the
best
part
of
this
is
that
you
can
drink
it
slow
and
it
will
flatten
out
so
it
does
get
better
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
nice
addition
of
red
meat
dishes
grilled
pork
and
even
with
some
ice
cream
this
would
work
i
would
avoid
fish
shellfish
and
poultry
at
all
costs
with
this
as
its
a
strong
flavored
brew
adding
the
yeast
diminishes
the
fresh
fruit
aspect
making
it
more
earthy
and
cuts
the
carbonation
definitely
better
without
the
yeast
o
this
is
a
delightful
beer
more
so
because
its
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
i
guess
i
was
thinking
something
more
malty
and
robust
and
less
fresh
and
light
and
delicate

stuff
overall

good

unique
flavors
everything
i
love
in
a
belgian
brew
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
traditional
bsda
everything
seemed
to
be
right
where
it
should
be
for
the
style
this
beer
had
very
good
drinkability
it
went
down
very
smooth
for
the
style
and
the
flavor
did
a
good
job
at
keeping
my
entertained
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
drink
with
dinner
what
i
liked
most
about
this
bee
was
pretty
much
everything
all
aspects
seemed
be
on
par
for
the
style
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
price
if
this
was
3
50
i
would
buy
it
much
more
often
i
would
be
this
beer
again
but
only
for
special
occasions
because
of
the
price
and
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
belgian
beer
and
this
may
be
a
good
beet
to
get
someone
into
the
style
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
will
for
sure
be
trying
their
other
beer
shortly
to
me
this
is
the
benchmark
for
the
style
and
really
good
beer
pours
lighter
than
the
8
with
a
light
brown
murky
color
one
finger
offwhite
head
smells
of
dried
dark
fruit
and
spice
light
yeast
funk
to
boot
flavor
seems
lacking
with
slightly
watered
down
figs
and
spice
and
some
lingering
yeast
on
the
finish
thinner
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
medium
high
carbonation
easy
drinking
i
guess
only
okay
does
not
live
up
to
the
other
rocheforts
one
of
the
better
bsdas
i
have
found
an
outstanding
beer
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
but
perhaps
the
flavor
is
not
quite
strong
enough
to
support
the
high
carbonation
nevertheless
it
is
a
world
classic
oi
cant
identify
the
dark
fruits
that
i
taste
but
i
know
that
i
like
them
this
is
one
real
beer
smooth
and
flavorful

is
no
easy
task
harmoniously
well
round

lively
but
not

harsh
very
drinkable
of
course
o
fair
beer
but
not
really
special
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
it
has
lived
up
to
its
hype
one
i
will
definitely
be
having
again

dated

it

hazy
brown
due
to
sediment
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
head
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
a
little
bit
of
white
head
on
the
top
bubbles
can
be
seen
meeting
the
head
indicating
high
carbonation
the
aromas
of
caramel
fig
roasted
malt
and
belgian
yeast
hit
the
nose
i
can
also
detect
a
small
amount
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
the
flavors
of
caramel
and
fig
go
a
long
way
towards
covering
up
the
alcohol
content
but
the
faint
taste
of
alcohol
is
there
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
the
carbonation
prepares
you
for
the
next
drink
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
o
another
excellent
brew
all
three
i
tried
6
810
were
exceptionally
really
enjoyed
drinking
these
brews
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
goblet
bottle
date
of
080915
this
pours
a
hazy
tea
color
with
a
massive
fizzy
head
which
dissipates
faster
than
i
can
type
this
sentence
the
smells
are
wonderful
very
fruity
lots
of
dark
fruit
a
little
belgian
yeast
esters
some
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
the
feel
is
medium
high
carbonation
the
taste
is
wonderful
a
little
fruity
some
peach
strawberries
apricot
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
some
brown
sugar
very
nice
quality
beer
that
could
present
problems
because
if
its
session
quality
o
a
great
beer
just
the
like
8
10
highly
recommended
for
anyone
who
hasnt
enjoyed
a
great
trappist
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
amber
with
a
big
two
finger
offwhite
light
coffee
colored
head
aroma
of
dark
fruits
mostly
also
grapes
caramel
and
hints
of
clove
and
spice
really
smooth
caramel
malt
to
start
one
of
the
better
highlights
of
this
flavor
in
a
beer
that
ive
had
not
huge
caramel
flavor
per
se
but
taste
amount
of
sweetness
and
mouthfeel
combo
is
perfect
moves
to
dark
fruit
notes
before
a
lighter
finish
of
white
grapes
and
a
pinch
of
spice
not
the
biggest
or
best
flavor
profile
but
very
cohesive
and
excellently
crafted
taste
is
smoooth
banana
belgian
hops
mixed
with
bready
biscuity
malts
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
yes
its
a
belgian
yes
everyone
should
take
note
its
delicious
simply
a
perfect
blend
loved
the
10
meh
on
the
8
huge
head
on
the
pour
with
close
to
zero
lacing
dark
amber
hue
with
a
cap
of
foam
a
few
minutes
after
the
head
subsided
i
get
dark
fruits
on
the
nose
blueberries
raspberriesl
some
raisin
fig
fruitcake
aromas
too
clove
bread
kola
nut
light
cherry
and
a
mineral
water
like
aftertaste
a
bit
different
taste
profile
from
typical
belgian
dark
ales
i
dig
it
o
complex
and
well
balanced
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
very
good
flavors
but
just
a
hint
too
much
for
this
to
be
sessionable
i
really
felt
satisfied
after
the
one
the
smell
and
taste
of
alcohol
is
well
hidden
o
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
offering
rochefort
8
is
a
very
good
beer
and
rochefort
10
is
world
class
this
isnt
even
in
the
same
ballpark
im
glad
i
had
it
to
complete
the
rochefort
trifecta
but
i
will
not
have
this
one
again
i
also
have
the
rochefort
8
and
10
and
am
looking
forward
to
trying
thank
you
barbara
for
this
ale
o
most
definitely
worth
picking
up
and
trying
nothing
to
really
complain
about
just
more
subtle
then
the
8
and
10
doa
o
this
is
the
second
rochefort
beer
that
ive
tried
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
at
all
the
aromas
and
flavors
have
a
lot
going
on
and
are
really
quite
good
on
top
of
that
the
plentiful
carbonation
and
fairly
light
mouthfeel
make
this
very
enjoyable
to
drink
i
would
love
to
have
some
more
of
this
as
well
as
try
some
other
available
trappist
offerings
o
very
smooth
very
crisp
although
the
taste
may
be
a
bit
underwhelming
especially
after
subsequent
tastings
lack
of
overwhelming
alcohol
taste
a
definite
plus
although
a
bit
on
the
light
side
of
flavor
it
is
nonetheless
a
very
good
beer
the
last
of
the
three
rocheforts
poured
from
bottle
to
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
nice
2
finger
offwhite
head
looks
great
good
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
a
mild
yet
delightful
mix
of
yeast
clover
raisin
licorice
fig
nice
fruity
character
the
flavor
is
complex
and
full
figs
toffee
prunes
licorice
toast
coffee
raisins
very
nice
and
developed
well
balanced
very
smooth
with
a

amount
of
carbonation
overall
terrific
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
finish
off
the
trio
recommended
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
color
not
black
looks
like
a
true
dubbel
not
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
scents
of
honey
brown
sugar
molasses
very
sharp
sweetness
on
the
initial
scent
not
much
lacing
taste
is
absolutely
bold
sweet
belgian
sweet
candy
on
the
wash
massive
molasses
on
the
front
but
of
course
with
great
brewers
not
cloying
absolutely
magnificent
tasting
very
light
plummy
taste
also
damn
i
wish
i
could
afford
this
every
session
the
taste
is
delicious
and
memorable
easy
drinking
with
a
medium
mouth
feel
very
smooth
and
a
joy
cheers
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
have
to
give
it
credit
for
remaining
more
subtle
to
the
taste
which
perhaps
allows
it
to
appeal
to
a
broader
audience
a
great
introductory
to
the
blue
and
green
cap
no
doubt
almost
all
of
the
ingredients
used
are
virtually
the
same
you
can
definitely
tell
that
with
each
fermentation
period
trappistes
rochefort
continually
add
more
of
the
same
ingredients
used
to
conjure
this
tasty
little
treat
plus
more
not
my
favorite
but
a
superb
beer
nonetheless
onot
everything
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
but
good
nonetheless
fresh
bottle
within
a
year
old
if
i
remember
delicious
treat
yourself
that
was
also
true
for
the
alcohol
i
could
feel
the
buzz
when
i
was
done
with
everything
but
not
at
all
when
i
was
enjoying
this
beer
while
this
isnt
flashy
or
has
a
sparkling
appearance
this
was
extremely
enjoyable
and
easy
to
down
although
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
sediment
here
this
had
every
characteristic
of
a
classic
belgian
beer
and
anyone
looking
for
an
appreciation
of
a
malted
barley
beverage
will
find
this
quite
enjoyable
o
a
nice
beer
smooth
and
complex
drinks
really
nice
o
would
like
it
better
if
the
alochol
were
better
hidden
o
not
really
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
as
i
found
the
beer
to
be
limited
in
its
esters
that
i
have
come
to
love
in
a
belgian
glad
i
tried
it
though
not
worth
the
6
price
tag
associated
with
it
as
id
rather
have
a
new
belgium
dubbel
egad
o
this
is
decent
but
theres
nothing
that
really
stands
out
here
its
a
very
delicate
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
unfortunately
the
price
of
this
is
a
bit
high
though
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
finely
crafted
belgian
ale
with
no
real
flaw
my
experience
with
the
rochefort
offerings
ive
had
is
that
their
richness
comes
in
the
feel
and
weight
of
the
body
moreso
than
the
flavour
if
that
were
adjusted
a
bit
where
the
flavours
were
made
bolder
they
would
be
exceptional
beers
including
this
one
in
front
of
me
now
well
worth
a
try
but
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
o
not
bad
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
nice
beer
that
goes
down
easy
notes
my
first
trappistes
definitely
good
stuff
although
not
one
of
the
best
bsdas
i
have
had
i
look
forward
to
the
8
10
later
today
o
finally
we
get
rochefort
in
texas
that
makes
five
out
of
the
seven
accredited
trappist
breweries
i
dont
expect
to
see
that
other
one
beginning
with
w
any
time
in
the
foreseeable
future
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
8
and
the
10
o
a
nice
dark
belgian
lots
of
fruity
earthy
flavors
balanced
malt
would
drink
again
o
a
good
brew
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
a
little
more
flavorful
as
it
seemed
to
be
a
bit
watered
down
compared
to
some
other
belgian
strong
dark
ales
while
its
a
very
very
good
beer
it
frankly
isnt
as
flavorful
as
the
rochefort
8
still
good
though
ill
experience
this
again
overall
it
is
a
very
good
belgian
strong
with
an
excellent
mouthfeel
it
is
not
as
dyanamic
as
the
other
rocheforts
so
no
real
whoah
features
other
than
the
mouthfeel
o
great
beer
will
definitely
buy
again
o
a
damn
fine
example
of
the
style
o
overall
much
lighter
in
flavor
and
body
compared
to
the
8
or
the
10
but
still
very
good
the
flavors
are
all
very
well
balanced
and
play
well
off
of
each
other
the
flavors
and
smell
werent
all
that
exciting
and
i
was
picking
up
more
alcohol
than
i
would
have
expected
at
7
5
d
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
with
nice
characterisic
to
the
flavor
but
there
didnt
seem
to
be
the
richness
and
complexity
that
i
have
tasted
in
other
from
this
style
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
alcoholic
heat
is
very
present
but
not
hot
or
fusellike
overall
it
is
a
little
light
bodied
and
light
flavored
for
my
taste
but
that
is
where
rochefort
8
and
10
step
in
o
another
solid
beer
from
the
brewery
o
this
beer
shows
promise
but
i
would
bypass
this
one
for
the
8
or
the
10
o
just
became
available
in
texas
so
i
had
to
try
it
the
taste
and
aroma
were
not
as
pronounced
as
expected
the
aroma
was
a
bit
hard
to
detect
and
the
flavor
was
only
a
bit
stronger
that
aside
the
beer
is
still
very
enjoyable
but
i
dont
see
the
hype
for
this
beer
i
guess
i
just
need
to
try
it
a
few
more
times
overall
a
decent
little
brother
of
the
excellent
rochefort
10
d
like
most
strong
ales
this
is
a
sipper
for
me
i
like
to
savor
every
bit
of
it
that
i
can
its
very
drinkable
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
and
taste
awesome
beer
a
really
really
good
beer
pretty
obvious
its
from
belgium
as
the
flaws
are
miniscule
i
am
surprised
that
i
did
not
like
this
beer
more
given
my
fantastic
experience
with
10
but
the
toffeeoxidized
flavors
just
dont
do
much
for
me
o
very
good
beer
great
as
it
warmed
worth
the
money
pours
out
a
hazy
dark
brown
beer
roughly
a
2
inch
head
and
this
sounds
funny
the
head
crackled
loudly
as
it
dissipatesmuch
more
so
then
other
beers
smells
of
licorice
malt
taste
is
extremely
hard
to
describe
its
sweet
has
a
very
mild
licorice
taste
tastes
of
spices
like
winter
beers
but
none
i
can
describe
a
very
interesting
beer
no
hops
whatsoever
mouthfeel
is
slick
mild
carbonation
o
beer
must
be
refreshing
this
is
a
complex
beer
but
as
shostakovich
is
complex
but
not
nice
in
my
view
i
think
this
one
is
the
shostakovich
of
belgian
beers
books
can
be
written
about
it
but
does
it
invite
to
buy
another
one
brrr
high
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
of
course
a
high
bar
o
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
have
had
before
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
and
unique
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
have
another
overall
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
of
the
rocheforts
it
is
still
an
excellent
beer
in
its
own
right
and
i
would
have
one
of
these
again
in
a
heartbeat
2004
bottle
seven
years
old
i
probably
shouldnt
be
rating
such
an
old
bottle
but
ill
adjust
it
accordingly
pours
a
dark
pumpkin
with
a
medium
head
ppretty
persistent
carbonation
nose
is
a
lot
of
raisins
dates
very
sugary
slight
cardboard
mouth
is
fruit
forward
honeysoaked
figs
and
dates
toffee
pleasantly
yeasty
and
a
lightly
cardboard
finish
a
bit
aggressive
on
that
malted
dark
fruit
but
its
pleasant
in
its
way
certainly
over
the
hill
i
need
to
drink
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
so
im
gonna
bump
the
scores
up
to
adjust
for
that
this
beer
is
just
so
phenomenal
i
saw
that
it
is
listed
as
a
bsd
it
seems
like
more
of
a
dubbel
to
me
but
whatever
it
had
a
nice
amber
color
almost
red
with
an
offwhite
head
that
had
great
retention
and
lace
the
aroma
is
strongly
of
caramel
and
medium
dark
fruits
not
so
much
plum
and
prune
on
the
tongue
it
is
very
malt
forward
but
it
doesnt
finish
anything
close
to
being
sweet
despite
what
the
aroma
lead
me
to
think
it
would
it
has
a
medium
high
carbonation
which
helps
the
finish
fuckig
epic
beer
dry
finish
the
carbonation
is
lively
and
crisp
i
liked
this
one
but
its
definitely
a
step
down
in
deliciousness
and
profundity
from
the
legendary
10
the
8
is
still
on
my
musttry
list
the
favorite
rochefort
of
this
not
big
rochefort
fan
overall
very
tasty
and
smooth
still
a
sipper
mosty
from
the
alcohol
at
the
end
not
as
complex
as
10
but
its
a
great
selecting
if
10
was
simply
to
much
for
you
to
handle
with
all
its
flavors
high
alcohol
etc
world
class
beer
here
do
the
best
test
of
any
beer
is
would
you
have
another
the
answer
here
is
yes
id
have
another
right
after
i
finished
this
one
if
i
could
very
good
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
head
about
a
finger
thick
the
aroma
is
full
on
yeast
and
sweet
malt
which
follows
the
taste
of
toasted
malt
and
molasses
there
is
some
fig
and
big
dark
wheat
bread
the
body
is
light
medium
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
really
pleasant
and
well
balanced
poured
a
massive
almost
all
head
of
offwhite
color
the
body
has
a
hazy
apple
cider
appearance
smell
is
very
mild
in
my
sample
with
just
a
little
dried
fruit
reminding
me
of
fig
and
some
caramel
taste
is
more
of
the
same
flavors
mild
and
with
a
buttery
texture
theres
a
subtle
long
tingly
finish
this
is
probably
one
of
the
mildest
of
the
trappistes
a
fine
beer
overall
not
as
incredible
as
rochefort
10
but
still
one
of
the
top
belgian
dark
beers
for
sure
a
welcoming
complex
beer
that
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
all
i
need
to
do
is
try
rochefort
8
and
see
which
one
of
these
holds
the
longest
redrinkability
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
big
yeasty
aroma
to
it
with
some
darker
malts
giving
off
a
little
sweetness
the
taste
was
a
little
smokey
i
thought
i
found
that
to
be
a
little
interesting
the
other
flavors
of
bread
and
caramel
were
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
in
my
opinion
though
that
the
beer
had
a
good
softness
to
it
overall
not
a
bad
belgian
brew
at
all
quite
enjoyable
o
a
very
good
belgian
ale
this
is
one
you
could
sip
all
night
o
a
good
beer
of
medium
complexity
a
bit
light
to
my
taste
very
much
like
the
8
but
more
watery
takes
on
the
same
malt
character
and
fruit
obviously
the
same
yeast
strain
a
little
thinner
in
the
middle
makes
the
alcohol
show
through
too
much
but
still
very
delicious
tastes
like
the
aroma
with
a
large
variety
of
dried
fruits
nutty
and
dry
in
the
finish
quick
and
abrupt
o
a
great
aroma
nice
taste
and
very
drinkable
and
smooth
a
nicely
crafted
beer
i
like
this
beer
but
i
was
expecting
to
be
a
little
more
impressed
i
actually
thought
its
nose
was
its
strong
suit
i
guess
i
need
to
try
the
8
and
the
10
o
extremely
drinkable
and
pleasant
belgian
strong
dark
ale
if
this
was
easier
to
come
by
in
my
area
i
would
make
this
a
mainstay
of
my
beer
fridge
overall
definitely
a
good
beer
but
not
a
gem
the
way
the
8
and
10
are
i
am
trying
to
review
it
on
its
own
merits
which
are
notable
rather
than
size
it
up
against
the
others
but
it
is
hard
to
ignore
the
comparison
entirely
i
certainly
like
this
beer
but
it
is
merely
good
rather
than
outstanding
from
notes
8111
pours
a
deep
amberbrown
with
good
clarity
and
a
fizzy
head
there
are
some
floaties
but
i
could
have
avoided
them
with
a
better
pour
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
floral
brown
sugar
bready
malt
fruit
raisins
peaches
apricots
plums
and
earth
theres
little
that
i
can
easily
ascribe
to
hops
it
smells
kinda
like
a
fresh
hunk
of
cinnamon
raisin
bread
topped
and
honeysuckle
the
taste
is
also
quite
nice
lots
of
sweetness
that
quickly
blossoms
into
earthy
complexity
the
feel
is
a
bit
fizzy
for
my
taste
but
not
bad
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
plenty
of
belgian
yeast
flavor
just
like
with
my
previous
orval
it
did
not
matter
how
gentle
my
pour
the
head
was
forming
at
an
incredible
rate
it
settled
into
a
rocky
finger
of
tawny
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
thanks
in
part
to
my
pour
nose
was
very
malty
toffee
caramel
fresh
baked
bread
dried
dark
fruits
and
even
a
light
must
mouthfeel
was
silky
gliding
over
my
tongue
on
its
way
to
my
throat
but
i
held
it
in
my
mouth
to
swirl
it
around
as
a
selfavowed
hophead
the
sugary
sweetness
of
the
malt
really
hit
me
wow
the
finish
had
a
bit
of
heat
to
it
and
i
had
to
sit
back
and
collect
myself
before
taking
a
second
sip
double
yoi
now
the
heat
and
sweetness
gave
way
to
a
melange
of
flavors
including
the
aforementioned
carameltoffee
and
raisin
bread
wild
i
just
worry
that
i
am
not
the
intended
audience
for
this
style
of
beer
but
i
hope
that
it
suffices
to
say
that
i
did
enjoy
it
all
in
all
the
beer
is
brown
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
yeast
malt
caramel
toffee
the
flavor
is
great
with
yeast
and
caramels
leading
the
way
not
nearly
as
bold
or
flavorful
as
rochefort
10
the
body
is
thinner
than
is
customary
for
the
style
smooth
on
the
palate
this
brew
is
highly
drinkable
i
would
have
this
again
o
not
a
bad
beer
has
the
misfortune
of
being
compared
alongside
the
rochefort
8
as
well
as
other
notorious
belgian
strong
darks
will
try
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
batchbottle
d
ummm
struggling
to
sum
this
beer
up
really
probably
because
i
found
it
so
bland
carbonation
and
dryness
levels
on
the
tongue
were
right
for
a
trappist
dark
ale
but
there
was
just
no
complexity
in
the
nose
or
on
the
palate
really
forgettable
will
need
to
hunt
down
a
fresher
example
d
there
is
definitely
something
wrong
here
the
expiration
date
is
060213
so
im
assuming
this
bottle
is
about
3
years
old
should
have
had
plenty
of
time
to
develop
but
maybe
the
yeast
ate
up
everything
and
just
left
me
with
bubbles
i
was
very
excited
about
this
beer
and
feel
hugely
disappointed
at
least
i
can
rely
on
the
couple
bottles
i
have
of
8
and
10
and
i
will
rereview
this
6
when
i
get
a
better
perhaps
younger
bottle
o
a
very
multifaceted
flavoursome
and
warming
ale
its
all
there
but
the
combination
of
flavours
just
doesnt
hit
the
spot
for
my
palate
rochefort
6
is
so
different
than
8
and
10
that
you
might
be
tempted
to
think
less
of
6
because
of
it
forget
about
8
and
10
6
holds
its
own
against
the
best
bsdas
in
the
world
i
avoided
buying
it
for
the
longest
time
because
i
thought
itd
be
too
much
like
a
dubbel
a
style
that
i
am
routinely
underwhelmed
by
as
it
turns
out
this
is
like
a
superdubbel
it
has
the
narrow
scope
of
a
dubbel
but
simultaneously
achieving
a
complexity
matched
by
few
dubbbels
this
would
be
a
perfect
pairing
with
rabbit
and
a
mushroom
risotto
it
would
likely
perform
marvelously
at
the
thanksgiving
table
dont
make
the
mistake
that
i
did
in
avoiding
this
beer
for
so
long
i
honestly
dont
understand
how
beers
like
this
score
so
highly
all
i
tasted
in
this
beer
was
alcohol
there
was
nothing
beery
whatsoever
that
i
was
able
to
pull
out
i
might
as
well
have
been
drinking
rum
or
scotch
it
poured
dark
brown
with
tanish
head
aroma
was
alcohol
taste
was
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
completely
over
carbonated
and
after
a
sip
from
the
bottle
it
almost
exploded
in
my
face
overall
not
impressed
whatsoever
my
3rd
rochefort
had
8
and
10
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
popped
the
top
and
a
loud
pop
and
hiss
followed
smokey
cloudy
vapor
just
swirls
around
the
top
of
the
bottle
crazy
cool
slowly
poured
into
brooklyn
tulip
glass
pours
a
murky
brown
color
very
little
head
but
visible
small
bubbles
come
up
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
dark
fruit
raisins
prunes
some
alcohol
detectable
brown
sugar
winter
spices
a
lot
going
on
here
taste
super
rich
carbonation
definite
raisin
presence
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
the
aroma
but
i
guess
i
didnt
expect
this
to
be
as
rich
and
flavorful
as
the
10
the
carbonation
is
crazy
its
almost
too
much
making
it
almost
acidic
from
the
sharpness
of
the
bubbles
its
a
little
bit
of
a
knock
of
this
one
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
me
of
its
bigger
brothers
8
and
10
the
lightest
of
the
three
and
i
would
say
the
most
savory
granted
this
still
have
all
the
belgian
ester
notes
they
just
dont
come
in
as
huge
as
the
others
pour
is
a
murky
beige
with
a
nice

as
retained
but
still
quite

voluminous

low

perfect
for

a

yams
or
as
an
accompanyment
to

starchs
a
wonderful
marriage
of
belgian
yeast
sweet
fruits
caramel
and
bready
malts
delicate
and
delicious
o
one
of
the
more
disappointing
rocheforts
i
had
this
many
years
ago
along
with
the
8
and
10
and
remember
enjoying
it
much
more
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
has
a
great
level
of
carbonation
very
high
overall
a
good
belgian
brew
that
goes
down
easily
and
is
very
tasty
this
is
definitely
enjoyable
no
matter
what
style
youre
looking
for
not
overthetop
great
but
definitely
something
to
try
at
least
once
o
i
have
not
had
the
8
or
the
10
but
i
would
like
to
try
them
after
having
this
beer
i
would
not
turn
the
6
down
down
but
i
probably
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
again
fairly
well
balanced
for
a
beer
clocking
in
at
7
5
abv
i
love
the
typical
belgian
characters
so
overall
i
am
pleased
with
this
beer
carbonation
seems
a
bit
heavy
but
it
eases
off
as
it
warms
good
thick
body
rich
wellbalanced
taste
good
beer
to
finish
the
evening
with
very
good
im
not
sure
ive
ever
had
the
6
before
but
it
seems
like
a
great
lowalcohol
and
i
use
that
almost
comically
to
most
belgian
dark
strongsbringing
much
of
the
same
aromas
and
flavors
to
the
table
with
a
mere
7
5
alcohol
as
with
most
belgians
this
is
strong
enough
and
sneaky
enough
to
knock
you
out
so
be
forewarned
but
this
would
be
a
great
belgian
dark
strong
to
pair
with
lamb
or
duck
kind
of
ordinary
but
unique
but
really
not
grabbing
my
attention
carbonation
is
too
off
putting
and
not
much
distinctiveness
i
say
meh
overall
i
expected
far
more
from
rochefort
overall
a
very
pleasant
drink
quite
complex
and
exciting
rich
and
fruity
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
oa
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
really
liked
trappistes
rochefort
10
and
hope
the
8
i
bought
at
the
same
time
as
this
6
will
be
better
i
wont
buy
the
6
again
overall
great
beer
not
just
a
watered
down
version
of
the
8
and
the
10
o
the
younger
less
talented
brother
still
very
nice
though
4
pp
price
point
4

an
imported
trappist
beer
is
fair
considering
what
some
u
s
brewers
charge
for
a
12ozer
7
2
is
very
nice
mid
range
you
decide
a
very
pleasant
extremely
well
done
beer
rochefort
6
is
almost
like
the
restrained
sibling
to
the
more
assertive
8
or
10
nicely
balanced
and
complex
to
the
end
i
could
easily
drink
another
o
i
had
high
expectations
based
on
my
love
of
rochefort
8
my
high
expectations
were
surpassed
although
i
believe
i
like
the
r8
better
and
more
eager
than
ever
to
try
it
and
the
6
again
overall
a
unique
beer
but
not
something
id
commonly
go
back
to
o
very
high
drinkability
some
faint
alcoholic
notes
might
be
detected
but
they
mostly
bring
a
nice
warming
feel
a
beer
with
no
flaws
and
a
very
much
classic
belgian
feel
to
it
not
as
amazing
as
most
trappist
beers
though
o
loved
this
really
cant
go
wrong
with
rochefort
they
know
what
theyre
doing
o
i
like
this
one
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
its
biggest
brother
in
terms
of
complexity
and
overall
awe
but
its
not
meant
to
a
very
enjoyable
albeit
lighter
overall
belgian
dark
from
the
legendary
trappistes
rochefort
overall
really
a
good
all
around
late
night
sipping
brew
this
beer
enjoyed
in
a
chalice
glad
at
the
abner
pub
in
norman
ok
pours
a
thick
brown
with
a
slight
amount
of
tan
head
with
not
much
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
with
hints
of
figs
and
plums
as
well
as
some
smoke
and
nuttiness
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
fig
and
cherry
notes
with
some
maltiness
added
in
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
overcarbonated
and
dry
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
pay
12
for
it
again
overall
this
is
a
nice
belgian
dark
ale
i
would
definately
have
again
if
i
ever
come
across
it
in
a
tradeunfortunately
rochefort
isnt
available
in
tx
yet
its
the
first
of
the
31086
ive
recently
aquired
and
very
much
looking
forward
to
the
others
overall
very
balanced
in
many
ways
not
a
mind
blowing
beer
but
a
sort
of
beer
where
you
just
wont
be
disappointed

floating

smells
of

i
also
get
a
very
subtle
hint
of
funk
and
vinegar
taste
is
of
caramel
dark
fruits
spices
and
belgian
yeast
lots
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
bubbly
and
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
way
better
all
around
based
on
reviews
and
information
i
have
read
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
per
se
but
i
guess
its
just
not
up
my
alley
o
overall
a
very
solid
brew
pretty
much
anything
that
can
handle
a
sweet
addition
overall
a
really
hard
beer
to
describe
but
its
good
so
well
blended
and
mild
i
wouldnt
take
anyone
elses
word
on
it
a
must
try
tasty
beer
and
enjoyable
in
its
own
regard

i
do
prefer

i
have

very

of

now
i
am
tasting
the

not
much
carbonation
in
this
one
so
the
broken

dissapears
after
a

a

which
is
very
drinkable
a
nice

if
you
want
to
try
a
belgian
beer
without
being

you
will
have
to
buy
this
one
d
excellent
drinkablity
rochefort
6s
balance
of
flavors
excellent
carbonation
and
smooth
finish
make
this
a
recommendation
for
a
beginners
belgium
beer
id
recommend
this
brew
to
the
novice
all
the
way
up
to
the
champions
of
beer
if
you
like
this
brew
and
want
something
bigger
bolder
and
much
more
stunning
go
for
the
10
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
but
it
is
certainly
light
in
fact
too
light
to
really
enjoy
all
of
the
flavors
id
take
a
rochefort
8
over
this
anyday
but
i
could
certainly
drink
this
all
night
d
i
think
the
beer
style
for
this
one
is
wrong
because
this
is
a
perfect
double
i
would
love
this
to
be
my
go
to
beer
it
is
highly
drinkable
could
drink
4
with
ease
unfortunately
at
5
bucks
a
bottle
that
will
not
happen
so
when
i
reach
for
a
rochfort
it
will
be
the
8
or
10
due
to
the
fact
one
is
satisfying
this
is
one
of
the
best
doubles
i
have
ever
had
had
it
is
better
than
chimay
rouge
too
bad
its
so
expensive
drinkability
tasty
and
creamy
overall
a
good
experience
which
i
just
know
could
be
a
little
better
if
it
were
cheaper
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
rotation
of
bsdas
not
bad
but
i
prefer
rochefort
8
and
10
over
this
for
a
few
reasons
theyre
both
easier
to
enjoy
and
deceptively
drinkable
i
cant
quite
say
the
same
for
this
appears
very
dark
cannot
see
through
at
all
semi
aggressive
pour
results
in
a
very
good
head
that
holds
up
a
finger
thick
even
in
the
wide
snifter
smells
of
fruit
mostly
cherry
and
some
raison
even
a
little
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
very
good
just
enough
sweetness
for
an
evening
beer
a
lot
of
malt
flavor
and
little
to
no
hop
presence
is
detected
this
is
not
a
heavy
beer
for
dark
belgian
ale
and
as
such
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
ive
tried
very
carbonated
and
light
in
the
mouth
i
taste
a
sort
of
bananalike
quality
up
front
a
lot
of
spiciness
bit
of
grape
very
tangy
but
also
refreshing
good
beer
cant
say
much
more
than
that
just
have
one
pleasure
to
drink
feel
is
good
small
bubbles
provides
a
creamy
and
soft
carbonation
that
is
really
pleasant
drinkability
overall
its
a
nice
belgian
ale
but
not
over
top
like
i
thought
it
could
be
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
finishes
nice
and
dry
high
carbonation
leads
to
high
drinkability
very
good
beer
recommended
d
smooth
yet
warm
the
alcohol
shows
in
this
one
its
a
really
good
warming
sipper
from
one
of
the
best
belgian
abbey
breweries
the
nose
is
yeasty
with
caramel
and
a
mildly
bready
character
brown
sugar
a
touch
of
earthy
spice
this
is
quite
delicate
but
also
underwhelming
the
palate
fares
no
better
opening
quite
yeasty
and
very
delicate
with
brown
sugar
sweetness
bready
and
caramellike
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
very
understated
light
in
body
high
in
carbonation
the
finish
is
decent
with
yeasty
and
spicy
character
this
is
not
particularly
impressive
while
i
had
no
problem
drinking
this
im
not
enjoying
this
too
much
nonetheless
i
will
buy
this
again
to
figure
out
exactly
how
wrong
i
am
this
was
my
first
from
rochefort
and
it
was
good
although
not
my
favorite
of
the
trappists
so
far
d
this
brew
has
it
all
from
the
looks
to
the
mouthfeel
this
was
hard
to
drink
slowly
d
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
the
alcohol
does
not
hit
you
until
you
throw
down
4
or
5
lol
notes
if
it
wasnt
for
this
beers
price
and
limited
availability
id
never
be
without
it
highly
reccomended
overall
outstanding
beer
id
highly
suggest
this
to
you
and
yours
heres
to
another
beer
cheers
drinkability
i
love
the
buttery
fruit
combo
i
could
have
several
of
these
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
in
the
style
md
light
bodied
good
carbonation
but
a
dry
feeling
in
the
palate
enjoyed
this
beers
smell
and
taste
md
slightly
lacking
drinkability
is
crazy
3
75
years
old
the
alcohol
is
undetecable
i
could
sip
on
these
all
day
long
drinkability
is
good
a
great
tasting
beer
very
well
hidden
for
a
7
5
abv
i
think
i
have
found
a
new
favorite
a
simply
outstanding
beer
cant
say
much
more
than
that
amazing
d
a
great
balanced
beer
great
to
drink
by
itself
or
i
could
see
pairing
this
one
with
some
lighter
fare
drinkability
pretty
good
brew
the
finish
is
a
med
body
with
tingly
carbonation
bouncing
along
the
sides
of
the
tongue
while
the
dulled
down
sweetness
lingers
with
the
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
considerably
different
from
it
8
and
10
counterparts
this
was
a
great
beer
to
get
your
hands
on
and
well
worth
the
search
d
this
stuff
is
excellent
i
wish
it
was
available
in
texas
because
this
would
be
a
semi
regular
purchase
worth
finding
to
try
d
higher
abv
dark
and
clear
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
aroma
of
caramel
nuts
and
raisins
flavor
of
dates
malt
dark
cherries
and
vanilla
a
slightly
sweeter
and
less
complex
version
of
the
8
nonetheless
very
nice
flavor
and
reasonable
complexity
should
age
well
d
not
too
shabby
at
all
great
for
a
slower
easier
drinking
night
overall
very
good
but
doesnt
touch
the
8
and
10
it
is
however
very
close
to
the
8
medium
bodied
with
a
hard
carbonation
feel
is
pleasant
as
the
carbonation
is
firm
and
resilient
if
a
good
swirl
yields
a
flat
spot
then
the
fruity
sweetness
that
results
is
light
on
the
tongue
fairly
drinkable
no
obvious
flaws
yet
no
great
compexities
the
color
was
extremely
dark
reminded
me
of
a
strong
black
tea
smelled
very
fruity
and
full
of
citrus
nice
not
to
overpowering
spicy
flavors
with
a
hint
of
semisweet
chocolate
i
also
got
some
apples
and
bananas
at
the
finish
very
fullbodied
beer
but
have
a
nice
creamy
finish
bottom
line
doesnt
compare
to
the
8
or
the
woldclass
10
it
was
worth
a
try
but
if
im
going
to
spend
the
money
on
a
rochefort
its
going
to
be
a
10
from
now
on
cheers
i
dont
typically
like
belgian
beer
because
they
tend
to
have
so
much
of
that
strong
raisin
kind
of
flavor
that
usually
turns
me
off
here
suddenly
that
became
interesting
to
me
mouthfeel
is
deferent
less
fruity
then
the
nose
figs
and
caramel
carbonation
is
a
perfect
representation
of
the
opening
high
almost
fizzy
but
this
tends
to
fade
in
after
a
few
minutes
a
capped
11
2
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
basic
tulip
glass
appears
a
cloudy
chestnut
color
with
about
an
inch
of
dense
light
rust
colored
foam
nice
retention
flavors
and
aromas
consist
of
prunes
raisins
molasses
bruised
apples
sweet
malts
spices
yeast
nearly
full
bodied
for
the
style
with
ample
carbonation
little
to
no
alcohol
heat
tasty
and
complex
this
beer
is
unique
to
say
the
least
based
on
the
aroma
i
thought
this
would
have
been
my
favorite
of
the
three
rochefort
beers
its
a
decent
tasting
beer
but
there
are
some
flavors
that
dont
mesh
well
overall
i
think
the
8
is
the
best
got
the
best
flavor
balance
without
tasting
too
much
like
a
fine
wine
i
would
recommend
it
but
just
dont
expect
it
to
match
up
to
the
8
or
10
drinkability
like
the
two
stronger
ales
from
the
monks
this
is
brilliantly
balanced
and
drinkable
this
is
probably
more
drinkable
than
the
other
two
with
the
lower
abv
brilliant
drinkability
is
good
the
most
approachable
of
the
rochefort
line
up
however
the
lesser
complexity
makes
the
phenols
a
bit
heavy
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
bite
of
carbonation
cheers
although
this
beer
pales
in
comparison
to
the
10
and
8
this
is
still
a
very
very
solid
beer
from
rochefort
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
this
beer
in
a
minute
impressive
see
my
8
and
10
review
not
my
favorite
this
deserves
a
revisit
someday
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
which
surely
has
something
to
do
with
the
lower
abv
at
the
same
time
in
comparison
to
style
ive
had
other
belgian
darks
that
were
better
while
im
willing
to
give
their
lineup
a
retry
i
just
wanted
to
include
a
note
regarding
the
fact
that
the
rochefort
line
didnt
impress
me
all
that
much
theyre
good
but
nothing
mindblowing
jordan
update
feb

i
would
add
that
the
beer
has
plenty
of
carbonation
a
good
bit
of
yeastiness
the
head
has
a
slightly
foamy
and
fizzy
head
the
nose
is
quite
nice
subtle
but
still
nice
i
would
add
points
here
there
are
some
definite
phenols
in
this
beer
lots
of
prickly
mouthfeel
a
slightly
sourish
fig
or
raisiny
flavor
too
d
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
often
but
an
occasional
dark
belgian
perhaps
i
think
it
is
very
nicely
nuanced
and
the
abv
is
not
noticeable
to
me
overall
a
great
trappist
ale
im
split
between
this
and
the
8
coming
out
of
rochefort
being
my
favorite
great
brewery
great
beer
followup

a
year
later
opened
one
of
my

it
improved

in
just
about
every
category
lots
more
distinctive
earthyfruit
notes
on
both
the
nose
and
the
tongue
definitely
one
for
the
cellar
d
i
really
like
it
if
a
beers
from
the
same
brewery
are
not
a
topdown
dilution
from
their
strongest
delivery
this
rochefort

stays
clearly
on
its
own
when
compared
to
the
8
and
10
simply
great
pours
a

though
quite

at

for
a
11
2oz
bottle
i
probably
wont
have
this
too
often
d
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
belgian
strong
ale
fits
all
the
characteristics
for
the
style
but
is
a
bit
on
the
lighter
end
not
quite
as
complex
and
flavorful
as
the
8
and
10
but
who
expects
it
to
be
definitely
a
more
sessionable
strong
ale
with
its
subtle
flavors
and
light
body
ill
have
this
again
hopefully
in
a
vertical
tasting
with
the
6
then
the
8
then
the
10

to

sweet

leaves
you
wanting

this
is
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
thank
you
jebus
drinkable
but
i
made
the
mistake
of
serving
too
cold
took
awhile
to
warm
up
so
i
could
smell
and
taste
it
even
so
i
had
a
hard
time
picking
out
much
in
both
categories
ill
have
to
try
this
again
and
give
it
another
chance
but
i
suppose
that
maybe
its
just
not
for
me
despite
its
reputation
a
very
well
rounded
belgian
dark
ale
complex
warming
and
inviting
a
brown
body
with
good
tan
head
with
lace
running
down
the
glass
a
good
sweet
malt
smell
along
with
some
minor
fruity
hops
a
puckering
sweetness
in
the
mediumbody
with
some
breadiness
as
well
for
balance
as
this
is
a
sweet
belgian
that
finishes
dry
and
has
hints
of
hops
bitterness
on
the
end
as
well
as
dark
fruits
classic
belgian
that
anyone
should
try
very
smooth
a
nice
sharp
flavor
thats
quite
malty
lingers
for
a
bit
very
bready
and
spicy
on
the
way
down
kind
of
a
light
body
but
good
for
the
style
d
rich
and
malty
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
dubble
the
yeast
profile
is
a
bit
dull
but
the
malt
especially
in
the
finish
makes
up
for
it
cheers
id
love
to
try
this
beer
iover
in
belgium
im
sure
it
would
be
very
different
this
one
pours
a
nice
reddishbrown
hue
with
ample
foamy
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
and
eventually
settles
into
about
an
18
inch
manhole
cover
over
my
beer
it
smells
of
dark
fruit
and
breaded
malts
tastes
a
little
bit
of
figs
but
mostly
of
dark
fruit
with
an
underlying
sweetness
that
im
unsure
how
i
feel
about
probably
just
because
what
ive
been
eating
today
it
drinks
surprisingly
well
poured
into
becher
glass
huge
tall
head

dissipates

and
you
can
drink
as
much
of
this
as
you
want
again
a
very
very
good
beer
this
is
the
one
that
is
produced
the
least
with
regard
to
the
8
and
the
10
so
some
retailers
tend
to
charge
more
than
the
8
im
glad
i
tried
it
however
given
the
chance
to
have
this
or
the
8
id
take
the
8
every
time
my
anticipation
for
the
10
is
now
even
greater
d
the
world
of
belgians
is
sort
of
a
new
thing
to
me

it
would
seem
im
off
to
a
good

be
great
with

other

food
to
balance
the
acidity
on

overall
a
very
drinkable
belgian
and
one
that
should
go
well
with
cheese
pairings
it
is
good
in
the
fact
that
it
is
simple
and
not
overly
complex
i
think
it
is
a
beer
that
almost
calls
for
food
especially
since
it
seems
to
be
a
rather
dry
beer
that
reminds
me
a

not

perhaps
a

it

color

caries
through
to
the

with
hints
of
apricot

in
the
finish
a
bit
of
banana
this
beer
seems
to
be
sweet
but
is
in

fairly
dry
the
general
fruitiness
helps
to
build
up
the
perception
of
sweetness
no

this

hides
it
well
quite
a

rochefort
6
is
an
exceptionally
balanced
soft
beer
that
awakens
and
sits
lightly
on
the
palate
its
inherent
tameness
works
well
an
ideal
evening
would
be
a
progressive
tasting
of
the
rochefort
6
then
8
then
10
i
bought
the
6
8
and
10
a
couple
days
ago
and
decided
to
try
them
in
that
order
at
5
99
a
pop
for
33cl
these
better
be
some
damn
fine
beers
and
the
6
was
not
a
disappointment
aromas
of
plums
and
raisins
with
a
malty
backbone
hinted
at
what
was
to
come
the
dark
red
brown
body
was
well
carbonated
but
produced
very
little
head
the
taste
was
of
dark
fruits
chocolate
and
toffee
with
a
nice
dry
bitterness
really
a
very
good
beer
but
not
good
enough
for
me
to
make
a
habit
of
everyone
should
try
it
but
there
are
many
beers
every
bit
its
equal
for
half
the
price
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
an
appealing
beer
on
the
palate
it
is
creamy
easy
and
just
suggestive
of
french
roast
cherries
and
frothy
milk
give
it
to
your
friends
who
suckle
boddingtons
they
might
come
around
as
for
me
ill
take
a
living
beer
brewed
by
monks
every
time
even
if
it
wasnt
so
darn
gosh
silky
this
was
the
first
of
a
rochefort
trilogy
at
a
recent
beer
tasting
the
6
o
g
is
mahogany
or
old
brown
leather
in
color
a
big
foamy
and
fizzy
beige
head
lasts
trails
of
sticky
lace
cling
in
places
and
bits
of
yeast
float
in
suspended
animation
after
gently
rolling
the
bottle
before
opening
a
damp
earth
malt
and
slightly
sour
aroma
prevail
not
overly
malty
or
hoppy
notes
of
caramel
light
cloves
and
a
hint
of
pine
finish
this
rather
dry
trappist
this
brew
poured
a
very
envigorated
large
creamy
head
of
fine
offwhite
bubbles
that
left
a
good
lacoing
and
a
carbonated
cloudy
yeasty
opaque
brown
body
its
flavor
is
comparatively
complex
like
its
bretheren
the
8
and
the
10
but
it
is
much
thinner
the
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
spices
and
in
there
just
like
its
kin
but
not
as
silky
smooth
as
the
8
and
with
less
bite
than
the
10
still
an
excellent
brew
this
abbel
dubbel
poured
a
large
invigorating
tan
long
lasting
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
there
was
good
lacing
on
all
sides
of
my
glass
the
aroma
was
somewhat
fruity
the
body
was
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
and
it
was
thin
and
watery
it
had
a
tingly
taste
to
it
and
i
prefer
the
rochefort
trappistes
8
to
this
one
a
surprisingly
aromatic
brew
i
caught
whiff
of
light
alcohol
aromas
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
bottle
poured
out
with
colors
like
a
big
malted
milk
ball
dark
brown
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
head
really
looked
like
a
big
kitchen
sponge
thick
and
porous
aroma
was
almost
that
of
some
sort
of
red
wine
with
prunes
and
alcohol
lemon
pine
sol
and
melon
too
kind
of
light
and
breadlike
up
front
with
a
reasonably
strong
alcoholic
and
bitter
finish
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
balanced
and
under
control
smooth
no
extremes
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
as
do
the
other
rochefort
beers
the
aroma
is
very
much
the
same
as
the
others
too
the
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
the
8
or
the
10
but
it
has
a
very
strong
hint
of
coffee
which
i
did
not
care
for
i
recommend
the
8
over
all
others
f
quite
stunning
in
appearance
the
color
of
autumn
leaves
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
huge
lace
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
bready
though
a
bit
weak
these
two
characteristics
dominate
the
flavor
as
well
midpalate
gives
way
to
a
deepfruitiness
giving
me
the
impression
of
something
like
raisinbread
very
smoothlyblended
and
gentle
with
a
creamy
body
and
a
finish
which
is
just
barely
sweet
what
drying
effect
there
is
seems
to
come
more
from
the
alcohol
than
the
hops
which
are
fairly
mild
a
really
really
nice
beer
drinkability
im
not
so
sure
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
as
i
can
name
several
other
trappist
brews
that
are
head
and
shoulders
above
it
pretty
good
but
not
great
small
330
ml
bottle
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
huge
frothy
and
creamy
offwhite
head
that
lasts
light
malt
and
somewhat
spicy
aroma
very
mild
fruity
and
bready
flavor
medium

with
very
lively
carbonation
nice

a

watery
palate
very
smooth
and
drinkable
alcohol
is
well
hiddin
lighter
than
the
8
and
10
still
a
great
brew
the
beer
pours
a
bit
of
a
hazy
purple
to
dark
red
color
with
the
head
pertinent
in
size
frothy
in
texture
and
the
lace
fine
long
lasting
sheets
vinous
lots
of
malt
fruit
sweet
quite
pleasant
to
sniff
with
the
start
ambrosial
and
the
top
skinny
in
feel
finish
is
astringent
pleasantly
hopped
and
a
nice
dry
lingering
aftertaste
a
good
beer
not
as
good
as
the
810
but
still
a
top
notch
beer
nonetheless
drinkability
notes
this
beer
is
too
highly
seated
to
be
all
alone
some
soft
cheeses
and
crackers
are
an
excellent
union
to
take
the
taste
buds
to
a
higher
level

this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
and
formed
a
huge
sudsyfoamy
off
white
head
that
circular
lace
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
spice
a
flavor
of
of
malt
and
spice
with
some
sudsy
aspect
to
the
mouthfeel
no
doubt
due
to
the
carbonation
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
a
a
touch
weak
compared
to
others
of
this
style
pretty
good
but
the
8
and
10
are
way
better
this
was
a
bit
sweet
and
lacked
a
bit
of
character
this
however
was
very
good
im
only
really
comparing
it
to
the
8
and
the
10
nice
spicy
chocolate
flavour
but
not
as
aromatic
or
as
tasty
as
the
other
two
weak
coffee
look
creamy
head
nice

smell
smooth
well
balanced
malty
taste
can
taste
a
banana
and
light
alcohol
at
the
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
good
looking
dark
brown
ale
with
malty
sweet
aroma
great
dark
fruits
taste
along
with
malts
and
caramel
there
is
a
burnt
essence
in
both
the
finish
and
aroma
there
is
some
alcoholic
quality
in
the
taste
but
it
is
masked
well
by
the
other
favors
full
bodied
creamy
and
quite
drinkable
i
will
definitely
get
again
prune
and
dark
dried
fruit

the

with
some

yeast
flavors
with
prune
over
ripe
fruit
spicy
malt
and
dark
sugars
medium

medium
full

and
medium
high
carbonation
the
carbonation
tones
down
the
malt
and
yeast
flavors
not
very
malty
in
the
smell
or
taste
but
of
a
hugh

nevertheless
bitterness
and
carbonation
are
at
good
level
bought
recently
at
the
lcbo
in
ontario
based
on
beer
connoisseur
mags
listing
this
as
one
of
the
best
of
2014
poured
it
into
a
chalice
shaped
glass
the
beer
is
brown
with
a
rich
foamy
head
and
some
lacing
going
up
the
glass
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
and
caramel
sweetness
this
is
a
complex
delicious
beer
that
is
enhanced
as
the
beer
warms
in
the
glass
its
velvety
smooth
final
grade
4
6
an
outstanding
a
westmalle
dubbel
makes
for
an
excellent
introduction
to
this
oftlauded
trappist
brewery
this
is
the
first
westmalle
product
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
and
im
already
pining
to
try
more
its
spicy
complex
flavours
are
both
enticing
and
wholly
satisfying
making
this
definitely
one
of
the
better
dubbels
that
i
have
tried
over
the
years
keeping
in
mind
that
this
is
probably
my
leastfavourite
of
the
major
styles
of
abbey
beer
i
am
still
convinced
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
dubbels
in
the
world
and
it
would
be
welcome
in
my
glass
to
celebrate
any
occasion
overall
a
lovely
sipper
that
would
be
perfect
for
christmas
drinking
in
my
opinion
lots
of
fruits
and
spices
overall
really
like
this
dubbel
as
it
has
great
dark
fruit
flavors
and
an
interesting
spicy
hop
profile
in
the
finish
only
complaint
is
the
finish
which
can
be
overbearingly
dry
other
than
that
its
a
great
beer
enjoy
a
bubbly
and
buoyant
dubbel
the
yeast
really
manages
to
cut
a
unifying
line
throughout
this
beer
to
deliver
a
highly
complex
and
refreshingly
tasty
trappist
ale
not
overly
weighted
in
any
one
flavour
group
it
is
simultaneously
rich
and
playful
between
the
groups
of
floral
spicy
fruity
and
malty
notes
delicious
beer
and
a
real
treat
one
of
the
top
belgians
available
heavy
on
the
banana
bread
flavour
and
dryer
than
most
in
this
style
this
is
a
beer
you
reach
for
when
you
are
out
of
all
other
trappist
beer
still
i
am
happy
that
the
lcbo
is
carrying
it
for
a
limited
time
here
in
toronto
laguardia
airport
at
the
crust
overall
a
wonderful
dubbel
thats
right
up
there
with
st
bernardus
pater
6
as
the
best
ive
ever
tried
just
pure
awesomeness
o
what
an
incredible
beer
such
massive
aromas
and
flavours
the
carbonation
could
be
toned
down
a
notch
but
its
not
like
its
offensive
the
way
it
is
o
i
cant
believe
i
put
off
trying
this
beer
for
years
based
on
a
previous
disappointment
by
the
same
dubbel
style
a
new
goto
for
me
when
im
craving
a
belgian
dark
sweet
and
full
of
esters
and
dried
fruit
will
buy
this
one
again
and
again
lots
of
flavor
mostly
fruity
pours
a

westmalle
hits

generally
speaking
i
prefer
their

but
this
is
a
stunningly
drinkable
dubbel
even
if
it
seems
to
be
lacking
in
the

department
stunningly
smooth
and
well
worth

ruikt
niet

lekker
en
de

its

i
feel
i
should
have
postponed
this
beer
a
few
days
and
cracked
it
on
thanksgiving
with
some
turkey
as
it
would
have
paired
well
ill
probably
have
to
cop
another
boo
hoo
these
monks
make
good
beer
my
favorite
trappist
beer
d
the
alcohol
is
very
well
maskedany
limit
on
drinkability
is
because
of
the
relative
body
of
the
drink
pours
from
the
bottle
a
cloudy
ruby
color
and
maintains
a
nice
head
well
into
drink
plus
the
foam
lacing
on
the
glass
has
a
nice
sweet
fruit
aroma
tastes
as
good
as
it
smells
if
not
better
not
quite
as
spiced
as
some
other
dubbels
but
very
enjoyable
all
the
same
warming
dark
soft
and
tender
a
touch
bland
as
no
single
one
of
the
numerous
great
qualities
is
overbearing
or
out
of
balance
with
the
others
its
easy
to
fathom
westmalles
excellent
reputation
the
body
and
alcohol
content
of
it
is
also
quite
manageable
so
this
is
a
belgian
that
can
be
enjoyed
on
easydrinking
occasions
recommended
for
any
lover
of
great
beer
and
a
great
place
to
start
in
the
world
of
trappist
or
belgian
beer
in
general
o
a
great
dubbel

not

of
a
dark

and
much
better
than
the
rochefort
offerings
this
beer
is
very
pleasing
with
wellrounded
balanced
flavour
so
in
all
conscience
i
cannot
give
this
less
than
4
5
for
me
it
only
loses
marks
on
the
appearance
as
it
has
rather
disappointing
head
i
had
this
on
draft
in
the
village
it
was
made
in
and
it
was
fantastic
delicious
but
this
review
is
based
on
the
bottle
i
had
in
brighton
and
it
was
average
a
little
bitter
and
had
an
unpleasant
burnt
after
taste
well
rounded
complex
really
beautiful
poured
from

first
impression

quenching
overall
first
trappist
dubbel
and
a
very
good
one
world
class
belgian
dubbel
simple
as
that
d
this
is
a
great
brew
i
think
if
it
were
a
little
thicker
and
had
less
carbonation
it
would
have
scored
even
higher
for
me
im
sure
the
carbonation
fades
with
time
will
stick
a
couple
bottles
in
the
cellar
and
forget
about
them
for
5
years
overall
this
is
in
my
top
10
this
is
the
third
time
ive
had
this
and
it
has
been
incredible
each
time
obviously
it
is
pricy
but
then
again
it
is
not
something
id
drink
just
any
day
purchased
a
single
12
ounce
bottle
from
michiana
minimart
on
1232014
for
4
49
taste
tested
on
1262014
bottle
had
a
best
before
end
date
of
150613
medium
hard
pour
resulted
in
two
fingers
in
the
tulip
glass
appearance
and
smell
were
definitely
above
average
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
excellent
aftertaste
held
well
and
was
also
excellent
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
dubbel
o
overall
a
good
dubbel
a
good
example
of
the
style
not
exactly
exciting
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
o
i
have
a
winner
i
am
bowled
over
by
this
dubbel
i
will
set
all
others
by
this
example
it
really
impressed
me
i
can
only
hope
that
others
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
have

com

a
cervejaria

o
its
not
the
best
ive
had
but
i
love
dubbels
and
i
love
this
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
the
authentic
trappists
work
im
missing
some
of
the
yeasty
flavor
you
often
get
from
a
good
dubbel
but
im
not
missing
it
much
i
could
drink
this
anytime
anywhere
and
be
100
happy
so
much
good
fruity
sweetness
mouthfeel
a
very
dry
after
taste
which
initially
was
surprising
to
me
and
the
carbonation
made
my
mouth
tingle
pours
out
dark
brown
really
dark
brown
with
a
three
finger
beige
head
with
nice
retention
and
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
dark
fruits
some
dark
malts
and
just
that
smell
of
a
blegian
dubbel
taste
is
much
the
same
as
the
nose
really
no
difference
except
maybe
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
and
belgian
candy
sugar
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
as
one
would
like
it
and
it
great
overall
one
of
the
greatest
belgium
beers
just
really
nice
the
feel
stops
short
of
sweet
spices
and
the
very
light
hops
character
balancing
it
expertly
a
little
dryness
is
pulled
out
of
the
medium
almost
full
body
almost
the
whole
of
every
sip
is
creamy
smooth
flowing
on
the
tongue
like
velvet
as
spiciness
and
alcohol
play
into
the
finish
o
a
handsome
brew
that
is
excellent
for
sipping
i
cant
comment
on
the
availability
but
something
i
would
like
to
enjoy
again
a
good
winter
beer
that
is
warming
and
highly
delectable
something
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
again
will
have
again
worth
searching
for
holy
moly
brilliant
self
evident
inexhaustible
and
vital
this
beer
exemplifies
the
style
and
is
worthy
of
your
utmost
attention
thick
frothy
white
head
sits
on
top
of
a
dark
redbrown
beer
that
is
almost
opaque
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
i
smell
white
wine
citrus
raisin
bread
some
cinnamon
flavor
is
out
of
this
world
caramel
grapes
more
of
that
raisin
bread
brown
sugar
with
a
perfectly
balanced
but
slightly
chocolateybitter
finisha
lot
going
on
the
carbonation
is
really
nice
on
the
tongue
slight
warming
from
the
alcohol
exceptional
outstanding
go
get
it
overall
this
is
a
great
trappist
brew
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
i
guess
i
have
to
get
another
bottle
because
i
dont
see
what
all
the
excitement
is
all
about
i
got
none
of
the
malty
yeasty
sweet
flavor
you
expect
from
a
dubbel
actually
it
was
not
full
flavored
at
all
i
would
compare
it
to
a
becks
dark
very
disappointed
overall
ba
or
a
solid
4
i
will
have
to
try
it
again
if
to
see
if
the
gush
significantly
effected
it
i
could
see
this
being
a
4
25
or
close
taste
is
dark
fruit
candied
sugar
and
to
use
a
term
someone
else
previously
used
and
is
totally
on
mark
refreshing
refreshing
is
a
great
adjective
for
this
its
easy
to
drink
not
too
bitter
not
too
rich
like
belgians
often
can
be
and
very
flavorful
with
raisins
and
figs
some
cherry
rjt
overall
this
is
an
excellent
dubbel
every
bit
as
good
as
westy
8
yet
cheaper
and
easier
to
get
o
nice
balance
of
fruitsmalts
without
being
abnoxious
probably
to
sweet
for
me
personally
to
have
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
but
one
i
will
have
again
overall
it
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
but
is
a
little
drier
then
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
dubbel
if
you
are
looking
for
a
crisp
belgian
style
with
some
good
fruit
flavors
and
nice
roasted
malt
taste
then
this
is
a
good
go
too
but
if
you
want
something
slightly
more
on
the
sweeter
side
then
this
is
not
what
you
want
it
is
certainly
good
and
something
to
try
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
drier
o
overall
quite
nice
though
i
think
ive
had
more
complex
wellcrafted
dubbels
certainly
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
though
any
day
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
o
a
great
example
of
a
matly
complex
strong
belgian
dubbel
o
a
very
pleasant
brew
overall
im
glad
i
picked
one
up
but
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
oalong
with
the
other
westmalle
offerings
this
brew
is
pretty
easily
obtainable
across
belgium
including
at
my
hotel
restaurant
which
is
were
i
had
a
bottle
for
dessert
one
night
last
week
this
is
undoubtedly
a
good
beer
with
decent
looks
and
aboveaverage
smell
and
taste
but
there
is
nothing
here
that
stands
out
and
makes
me
say
wow
i
cant
wait
to
drink
that
again
o
this
is
a
really
good
sipper
the
dark
fruits
are
amazing
pairs
well
with
street
tacos
dark
meats
and
ice
cream
especially
pralines
and
cream
ice
cream
its
a
damn
good
dubbel
o
a
little
underwhelmed
especially
for
the
price
but
it
is
an
import
this
would
be
my
cheap
session
beer
if
i
lived
in
belgium
and
it
was
indeed
cheap
unfortunately
it
is
not
at
least
here
in
the
states
very
complex
yet
well
balanced
beer
that
was
quite
rich
from
the
get
go
and
dominated
by
dark
fruits
and
sweet
malts
throughout
a
really
nice
one
that
takes
a
while
to
open
up
but
once
it
does
there
is
no
looking
back
overall
a
quality
beer
but
maybe
bot
quite
on
par
with
other
trappist
offerings
o
if
you
search
for
a
real
complex
beer
try
a
trippel
or
a
quadruppel
but
if
you
look
for
a
really
good
beer
even
if
it
is
simple
a
westmalle
dubbel
will
serve
enough
the
first
and
one
of
the
best
a
premier
trappist
ale
that
can
work
as
an
introduction
or
as
a
expertlevel
representation
of
traditional
belgian
ales
spiegelau
tulip
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
i
would
say
this
would
be
a
good
starting
point
for
anyone
wishing
to
get
into
trappist
beers
and
dont
want
to
start
with
a
heavy
quad
and
need
something
more
accessible
but
not
lacking
in
the
complexity
and
flavor
dept
i
will
be
buying
this
again
and
again
as
its
a
lot
cheaper
than
its
rochefort
cousins
like
i
say
with
every
trappist
beer
i
try
i
alwasy
have
high
expectations
and
they
never
fail
to
dissapoint
its
not
just
hype
its
quality
craftsmanship
monks
make
damn
good

this

this

is

well
balanced
with
notes

banana
and
something
that
makes
me
think
of
almondflavoured
liqueur
decent
i
might
get
it
again
im
not
too
crazy
about
the
hops
dominating
the
other
flavors
bottom
line
a
must
try
brew
i
tasted
a
litte

which
persist

the

is
average
beer
is
mediumlight
to
medium
in
body
with
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
that
work
well
for
its
weight
the
result
is
a
mouthfeel
primarily
smooth
with
slight
foaminess
which
flows
across
the
palate
quite
easily
closes
quite
dry
with
a
medium
amount
of
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
much
much
better
tasting
than
the
ordinary
less
dark
version
this
beer
is
very
rich
and
even
better
tasting
than
its
appearance
would
suggest
as
usual
with
me
anyway
the
first
taste
wasnt
very
gratifying
but
the
second
and
every
thereafter
were
very
good
tasting
with
that
full
taste
ever
present
the
more
you
drink
the
more

is
its

a

that
is
still
the
quintessential
dubbel
a
real
old
world
treat
its
our
duty
to
keep
buying
this
beer
prost
lampertland
great
things
are
happening
here
i
usually
prefer
their
tripel
to
this
one
but
if
you
match
it
with
a
meal
the
dubbel
can
compliment
food
nicely
overall
i
would
get
again
but
probably
not
very
often
great
beer
though
fantastic
beer
with
a
beautiful
dark
brown
appearance
and
a
powerful
aroma
i
was
absolute
amazed
with
it
the
taste
is
very
good
although
i
had
other
trappist
dubbels
that
were
slightly
more
delicate
but
dont
understand
me
wrong
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
full
of
character
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
seen
in
the
review
scores
o
a
complex
malty
beer
overall
much
preferred
this
beer
at
room
temperature
flavors
and
smells
came
out
another
sipping
beer
prefer
the
rochefort
6
over
this
but
nice
dubbel
westmalle
says
this
beer
will
improve
for
up
to
for
years
mine
was
bottle
7
14
11
but
knowing
my
palette
id
like
a
newer
bottle
still
it
shows
lots
of
highlights
and
the
sum
of
those
highlights
is
better
than
any
individual
part
in
some
respects
this
reminds
me
of
the
putrid
sweetness
of
a
barleywine
with
loads
of
sweet
barley
malts
at
first
followed
by
a
pungent
potent
bitter
hop
finish
it
burns
a
little
on
the
end
but
not
in
a
bad
way
this
is
quite
a
beer
o
a
nice
dubbel
that
could
be
more
bold
the
biscuity
base
limits
all
that
this
beer
can
accomplish
given
this
basis
they
did
a
fantastic
job
o
a
great
subtle
but
flavorful
belgian
complex
and
delicate
loads
of
dark
fruit
and
earthy
aromas
deceptively
drinkable
this
is
a
spectacular
dubbel
o
decent
drinkability
a
really
nice
dubbel
o
one
of
the
better
dubbels
available
smooth
rich
and
tasty
bless
those
monks
poured
into
a
snifter
this
beer
has
a
dark
earth
brown
color
to
it
with
some
fermentation
floating
around
with
the
carbonation
and
its
all
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
slowly
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
surrounded
by
some
really
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
complex
brown
sugar
plums
figs
and
raisins
all
come
up
apple
and
wine
smells
also
come
through
slightly
bitter
overall
the
flavors
is
just
as
complex
the
hops
are
present
as
you
swallow
mild
grapefruit
zest
dark
fruits
and
some
raisin
are
all
mixed
in
it
has
a
mediumtofull
body
and
is
filled
with
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
ill
be
drinking
this
one
more
often
westmalle
dubbel
is
another
trappist
gem
it
must
be
tried
if
you
even
remotely
favor
belgian
ales
a
beer
that
evolves
as
you
drink
it
loved
both
the
dubbel
and
the
tripel
i
will
chase
more
brews
from
westmalle
o
really
nice
dubbel
probably
the
best
ive
ever
had
of
this
style
better
than
the
chimay
imo
o
very
tasty
and
delicious
really
love
the
weatmalles
both
this
and
the
tripel
are
delicious
mouth
feel
was
great
and
full
ive
had
this
before
with
a
bad
pour
and
it
seemed
overly
carbonated
but
this
time
it
was
perfectly
balanced
a
great
beer
that
is
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
a
nice
example
of
a
trappist
ale
a
style
i
continue
to
seek
more
examples
of
ill
have
to
grab
this
brewerys
tripel
next
time
bottle
from
belgianbeershop
com
head
beige
thick
stable
nice

color
dark
red
brown
very
beautiful
aroma
filled
with
roasted
malts
chocolate
coffee
caramel
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
with
a
fantastic
full
mouthfeel
notes
of
caramel
and
banana
very
long
finish
this
is
one
of
the
best
trappist
ales
almost
as
good
as
the
westmalle
tripel
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
with
lighter
amber
highlights
fluffy
creamcolored
one
and
half
finger
head
candi
sugar
and
a
hint
of
almond
on
the
nose
complex
flavors
of
caramel
chocolate
nutty
grains
raisin
and
date
mild
spice
throughout
drying
from
midpalate
through
the
finish
crisp
carbonation
balances
the
syrupy
medium
body
lightening
it
a
bit
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
a
landmark
brew
o
a
very
enjoyable
brew
its
dark
roasty
nutty
and
caramel
mixed
with
light
citrus
fruits
and
crisp
carbonation
its
very
unique
and
very
enjoyable
o
not
a
bad
dubbel
somewhat
thin
though
and
the
fruitiness
is
borderline
sour
all
depends
if
that
sort
of
thing
is
your
bag
for
me
meh
very
smooth
medium
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
an
excellent
beer
in
nearly
every
way
highly
recommend
it
appearance
is
a
hazy
brown
and
very
i
mean
very
foamy
definitely
good
to
look
at
aroma
of
malts
and
wood
mostly
to
my
nose
taste
is
very
longlasting
with
dark
fruits
at
first
ending
with
wood
and
dry
notes
mouth
feel
is
not
light
but
not
heavy
carbonation
either
falls
in
between
the
aroma
is
not
as
complex
and
nice
as
the
taste
so
dont
let
the
first
impression
fool
you
definitely
worth
trying
glad
i
did
overall
perfect
equilibrium
good
trappist
beer
long
in
mouth
maybe
the
aroma
is
not
so
fine
as
the
later
taste
but
in
mouth
is
an
amazing
ale
classic
flavor
is
date
lightly
bitter
cassis
perhaps
smells
sweeter
than
it
tastes
i
love
that
very
slight
tang
at
the
finish
overall
this
beer
is
balanced
nicely
i
will
definitely
be
buying
some
more
in
the
near
future
overall
a
truly
complex
and
amazing
beer
there
is
really
so
much
going
on
here
and
the
flavors
change
as
the
beer
warms
one
of
the
classics
o
just
stellar
god
blesses
this
brew
overall
i
think
my
expectations
were
to
high
or
the
best
buy
date
is
accurate
as
it
tasted
like
its
best
days
are
behind
it
i
will
try
again
as
i
want
to
taste
what
i
can
smell
overall
very
nice
friday
night
dinner
beer
very
good
rating
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
very
drinkable
beer
but
the
taste
is
slightly
unbalanced
and
a
bit
to
sour
to
become
a
favourite
o
how
the
dubbel
is
done
of
course
onpoint
for
the
style
classy
enough
brew
for
the
novice
or
adept
a
good
baseline
for
evaluating
other
dubbels
light
to
medium
body
carbonation
is
slightly
high
its
a
great
trappist
brew
as
most
are
old
faithful
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
i
usually
go
for
this
a
rochefort
or
abt
12
when
i
want
a
good
abbey
brew
ive
tried
quite
a
few
times
trippel
version
of
westmalle
and
was
blown
away
each
time
thats
why
i
decided
to
go
for
dubbel
too
it
has
awesome
dark
color
nice
head
malty
taste
and
dark
fruits
aromas
alcohol
is
well
hidden
although
it
does
hit
hard
overall
would
go
for
this
one
anytime
again
i
see
it
as
suitable
in
the
evenings
and
in
the
winter
period
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
one
and
trippel
i
would
still
go
for
the
last
a
classic
example
of
the
style
that
every
beer
fan
should
try
at
least
once
or
twice
it
is
not
overly
rich
or
sweet
and
has
a
nice
complex
blend
of
flavors
i
have
been
harassed
for
years
for
turning
my
nose
to
dubbels
dont
ask
me
why
they
just
didnt
sit
right
with
me
always
seemed
like
the
shitty
little
brother
to
my
lovely
quads
not
the
juicy
quads
on
these
foreign
girls
that
raid
my
nest
but
the
herculian
brew
we
all
raise
a
glass
to
those
spectacular
beverages
that
push
the
double
digit
mark
on
the
abv
scale
for
the
second
time
in
my
life
i
have
been
proven
wrong
avoiding
dubbels
meant
that
i
was
avoiding
westmalle
dubbel
and
this
beer
happens
to
be
one
of
the
most
finely
tuned
brews
on
gods
green
earth
the
perfect
balance
exceptional
taste
and
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
the
breasts
i
had
in
my
mouth
this
past
weekend
this
in
turn
reminded
me
of
the
third
time
in
my
life
i
had
been
proven
wrong
right
after
discovering
this
special
beer
i
was
approached
my
a
looselipped
dutch
girl
at
a
hostel
i
was
spending
the
night
in
during
conversation
breast
size
was
brought
up
and
my
friend
guessed
that
she
was
a
bcup
i
laughed
at
the
notion
that
she
was
a
b
since
that
chest
was
going
nowhere
but
inward
so
leaned
closer
for
further
inspection
with
the
westmalle
dubbel
in
one
hand
i
used
my
free
mitt
to
size
up
the
specimen
he
was
right
bcup
i
then
finished
my
westmalle
and
convinced
her
to
fetch
more
beers
i
then
went
to
sleep
she
could
not
trick
me
into
sleeping
with
her
since
that
night
i
have
realized
that
when
guessing
bra
size
the
bcup
is
the
goto
cup
size
that
guess
will
win
you
more
battles
than
you
lose
there
is
also
such
a
goto
when
it
comes
to
world
class
beers
this
is
westmalle
dubbel
it
may
not
be
the
peoples
champ
like
the
overhyped
ccup
but
it
is
always
the
goto
when
you
need
something
to
bring
home
i
am
now
a
dubbel
man
and
westmalle
is
my
girl
final
verdict
if
you
havent
had
this
ale
buy
it
it
wont
let
you
down
it
is
more
like
champagne
in
consistency
and
in
flavor
than
any
beer
i
have
had
otherwise
im
not
a
large
fan
of
champagne
i
once
bought
a
bottle
of
dom
perignon
and
moet
et
chandon
white
star
to
see
if
it
would
make
a
difference
it
didnt
but
this
isnt
a
putdown
of
the
beer
it
does
what
champagne
could
not
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
westvleteren
tulip
thick
twofinger
tan
head
dissipates
to
thin
lighter
tan
head
chunky
lacing
dark
redbrown
color
looks
good
to
me
aroma
is
light
on
the
nose
there
is
sweetdark
fruit
but
also
the
typical
crispness
its
not
overwhelming
but
the
smell
is
fresh
and
light
taste
is
similar
to
smell
except
less
sweetness
more
dark
fruit
it
does
have
a
nectar
flavor
to
it
but
again
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
fresh
and
crisp
almost
like
a
champagne
with
medium
carbonation
and
relative
smoothness
overall
i
do
really
like
this
beer
perhaps
more
than
westmalle
triple
but
certainly
not
as
much
as
rochefort
10
or
westvleteren
xii
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
cheers
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall

westmalle
dubbel
is
one
extremely
tasty
beer
it
packs
a
ton
of
great
yeasty
fruity
flavor
into
a
relatively
low
abv
package
for
the
style
despite
being
a
bit
flawed
its
one
of
the
classics
of
the
beer
world
and
it
is
a
special
occasion
whenever
its
in
the
glass
youre
holding
superb
hmmm
not
sure
about
this
one
perhaps
i
let
it
get
too
old
the
sweet
fruity
character
that
i
would
expect
from
a
dubbel
is
present
but
seems
muted
the
stewed
hopcardboard
notes
on
the
other
hand
are
excessive
and
taint
the
flavour
the
phenolicalcohol
hints
also
seem
disproportionate
im
not
loving
it
but
i
suspect
its
gone
stale
andor
oxidised
ill
try
and
rereview
when
i
get
my
hands
on
a
fresher
example
bottle
from
tipples
in
gainesville
pours
a
deep
purple
brown
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
aroma
of
figs
raisins
spice
yeast
flavor
follows
with
big
fig
and
raisin
flavors
some
light
pears
spicy
yeast
sweet
brown
sugar
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
medium
high
carbonation
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
lingering
sweet
dark
fruit
on
the
palate
only
complaint
is
that
id
like
a
little
more
body
on
this
one
very
nice
beer
overall
this
is
another
classic
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
not
my
favorite
or
the
best
example
from
belgiam
if
you
want
my
opinion
but
tasty
not
too
filling
and
readily
available
not
as
good
as
the
tripel
but
close
o
completely
satisfying
to
be
honest
this
is
beyond
my
palate
but
i
did
my
best
i
used
to
avoid
dubbels
but
it
has
rapidly
become
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
dont
know
if
i
was
drinking
the
wrong
ones
or
just
not
paying
attention
but
i
plan
to
investigate
further
with
warmth
and
each
sip
this
one
just
opens
up
so
nicely
which
i
find
is
the
case
with
great
beers
amazing
example
of
the
style
and
what
i
look
for
from
a
strong
yeast
belgian
beer
has
that
nice
edge
but
doesnt
kill
you
with
spice
esters
and
alcohol
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
very
nice
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
o
pretty
boring
maybe
i
dont
like
dubbels
i
think
the
westmalle
goblet
is
too
domineering
for
this
light
tipple
this
was
the
first
belgian
dubbel
i
ever
had
and
i
loved
it
so
much
that
i
spent
months
seeking
out
other
highlyrated
dubbels
but
in
the
last
four
years
i
have
yet
to
find
a
dubbel
that
i
like
more
than
this
its
not
mindblowing
but
its
nearly
perfect
for
what
it
is
this
is
always
a
treat

as
the
tripel
pours
deep

with
a
foamy

decent
retention
and
falls
to
a
foam
atop
the
ale
not
much
for

on
the

and
the
ale
does
have
quite
a

somewhat

warming
as
it
goes
down
overall
excellent
example
of
the
style
exceptional
quality
and
even
though
this
one
was
3
years
old
its
still
in
great
condition
i
love
that
about
belgian
ales
d
worlds
apart
from
the
westmalle
tripel
which
was
one
of
the
most
disappointing
tripels
ive
ever
tried
this
one
the
other
hand
after
many
dubbels
quads
and
bsdas
still
stands
out
as
a
remarkable
beer
a
truly
classic
trappist
beer
that
should
stand
as
a
benchmark
for
what
this
style
should
be
deep
rich
and
complex
drink
its
a
good
dubbel
nice
flavors
a
little
compact
in
places
one
of
the
better
dubbels
but
still
doesnt
wow
me
overall
this
is
good
fare
but
suffers
from
a
lack
of
any
extraordinary
characteristic
to
set
it
apart
from
its
peers
the
flavors
here
are
good
but
the
beer
feels
like
it
needed
more
of
somethingsugars
would
be
a
good
place
to
startto
bring
out
a
lovely
bouquet
the
slight
staleness
to
the
latter
half
of
the
mouthful
and
aftertaste
is
also
unsettling
its
still
a
good
trappist
ale
but
simply
needed
to
be
more
aweinspiring
more
grains
than
rochefort
but
not
as
much
as
westvleteren
this
is
much
more
slick
than
the
others
with
a
nice
prune
and
cherry
sweetness
carbonation
really
makes
the
flavors
pop
and
disappear
finishes
exceptionally
clean
and
smooth
o
very
disappointing
i
had
saved
this
towards
the
end
of
a
huge
haul
with
the
other
special
belgians
thinking
it
would
be
a
special
belgian
but
its
not
its
unattractive
and
faint
the
best
you
could
say
about
it
is
that
its
kind
of
light
and
refreshing
if
youre
ever
in
the
mood
for
something
innocuous
that
doesnt
really
get
you
involved
or
bogged
down
like
if
youre
meeting
someone
for
a
drink
but
dont
really
want
to
and
just
want
to
drink
up
and
get
out
but
youre
left
wanting
after
each
sip
wanting
flavor
and
richness
and
body
its
hard
to
believe
its

id
have
guessed

if
id
never
heard
of
this
beer
id
rate
it
average
i
thought
i
had
heard
it
was
really
good
so
its
extra
disappointing
thats
not
extra
points
off
just
context
its
not
offensive
just
weak
i
feel
kind
of
robbed
given
what
it
could
have
been
will
not
buy
again
and
if
you
offered
me
this
at
a
party
i
might
abashedly
ask
if
you
had
anything
else
overall
i
had
this
shortly
after
i
turned
21
and
it
blew
my
mind
drinking
it
now
its
still
pretty
tasty
a
lot
less
mindblowing
but
wellbalanced
and
nuanced
a
touch
too
carbonated
for
me
in
the
long
run
flavors
are
on
point
though
o
satisfying
and
complex
this
trappist
ended
up
giving
me
a
memorable
experience
it
wasnt
an
incredibly
satisfying
palate
but
it
was
nice
and
wellrounded
id
buy
it
again
especially
if
i
could
find
it
really
fresh
somewhere
ovr
a
very
drinkable
beer
quite
complex
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
i
find
the
balance
between
the
sweetness
of
the
roasted
malts
and
the
acidity
sour
of
the
fruitiness
just
a
little
off
the
only
reason
it
scored
lower
in
certain
areas
overall
a
pretty
good
dubbel
typical
of
the
style
good
example
of
the
style
im
just
not
generally
a
fan
id
drink
this
again
if
someone
offered
it
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
because
i
really
enjoy
dark
belgians
of
all
kinds
i
feel
the
bottle
i
had
must
have
been
past
its
prime
as
its
very
close
to
the
bestbefore
date
on
the
bottle
ive
never
had
it
before
now
but
will
give
it
another
go
if
the
opportunity
arises
330ml
bottle
poured
into
leffe
chalice
dark
brown
thick
one
and
a
half
finger
head
reasonable
retention
smelled
pleasant
fennel
but
not
much
else
tasted
roasted
maris
otter
style
malts
and
fennel
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
citrus
hop
at
the
very
end
mouthfull
was
coarse
not
what
i
expected
overall
i
was
slightly
disapointed
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
would
probably
benefit
from
aging
overall
a
great
authentic
belgian
dubbel
great
fruity
taste
with
a
nice
spicy
kick
o
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
there
is
a
nice
complexity
to
the
flavors
definitely
one
to
get
again
this
is
a
complex
brew
that
has
many
layers
of
flavors
but
lacks
a
good
home
feel
that
i
like
out
of
dubbels
still
very
good
i
could
certainly
feel
the
effect
of
the
alcohol
when
i
finished
the
bottle
along
with
the
influence
of
dark
fruit
no
spice
or
lambiclike
sourness
here
just
a
wonderfully
warm
and
inviting
beer
that
called
for
a
slow
drinking
session
to
enjoy
it
no
doubt
that
this
deserves
to
be
called
one
of
the
classics
and
a
musttry
for
all
who
love
a
wellcrafted
and
enjoyable
brew
highly
recommended
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
trappist
dubbel
ales
o
this
is
a
classic
for
a
good
reason
in
this
case
its
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
rich
and
decadent
extremely
pleasant
to
be
sipped
slowly
at
the
end
of
the
night
poured
from
bottle
slowly
into
my
chimay
chalice
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
translucent
color
some
dark
orangebrown
hues
appear
as
the
light
hits
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
nice
rich
fluffy
off
whitetan
head
fills
the
glass
and
stays
around
for
awhile
covering
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
thick
lace
and
leaving
a
creamy
1
finger
of
head
when
its
done
receding
beautiful
looking
beer
smell
dark
fruits
like
raisins
some
aged
cherries
brown
sugar
not
all
that
much
going
on
with
the
aroma
taste
wow
cognac
cherries
brown
sugar
raisins
this
is
an
incredibly
creamy
and
rich
ale
perfectly
carbonated
and
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
my
night
has
been
much
improved
having
had
this
ale
tonight
the
yeast
westmalle
uses
is
legendary
and
deservedly
so
amazing
o
i
have
not
had
too
many
dubbels
before
but
this
one
is
superb
will
be
buying
more
westmalle
for
sure
mouthfeel
slightly
sour
a
little
bitter
easy
to
drink
again
with
a
little
citrus
but
as
opposed
to
the
aroma
this
is
definitely
stronger
on
the
yeast
end
overall
an
amazing
beer
a
truly
great
dubbel
overall
excellent
dark
belgian
dubel
will
return
the
33cl
bottle
is
not
big
enough
i
want
to
drink
this
all
night
pours
a
cloudy
rich
brown
with
a
red
tinge
great
foamy
tan
head
with
good
retention
rich
aroma
with
emphasis
on
the
malt
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
darker
roasts
and
a
fruity
ester
taste
is
the
highlight
here
orgy
comes
to
mind
rich
caramel
and
darker
malt
chocolate
and
nutty
fruity
esters
also
play
a
big
role
date
and
raisin
entertaining
to
the
last
drop
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
hint
of
alcohol
overall
a
fantastic
beer
make
sure
you
serve
this
at
the
right
temp
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
the
smell
and
flavour
of
the
westmalle
dubbel
leave
me
wanting
more
and
more
but
dubbels
are
easy
to
come
by
here
in
vancouver
so
theres
a
lot
of
competition
for
it
id
usually
pick
a
dubbel
with
a
less
aggressive
fizz
o
very
good
overall
not
too
sweet
with
a
nice
bread
and
spice
presence
o
so
far
the
hype
of
the
trappists
has
not
done
the
beers
favor
in
my
opinion
they
are
all
great
but
im
always
expecting
more
going
in
still
a
fantastic
beer
very
tasty
but
not
stupendous
overall
a
trappist
monastery
in
belgium
shines
again
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
for
the
style
second
behind
rochefort
8
for
me
havent
had
westy
8
to
compare
so
this
is
second
in
my
book
overall
excellent
world
class
for
style
unfortunately
not
cheap
in
the
u
s
a
great
sipper
engaging
flavorful
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
the
look
smell
flavor
and
feel
all
seem
just
right
for
each
other
highly
recommended
pours
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
retains
well
plenty
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
of
chocolate
and
maybe
a
bit
of
fig
the
first
sip
feels
creamy
i
pick
up
flavors
of
roasted
malts
sugar
and
fig
the
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
theres
a
mild
spiciness
to
it
the
flavor
profile
is
well
balanced
its
not
too
sweet
its
not
too
dry
the
carbonation
is
definitely
present
but
its
not
overwhelming
this
hides
its
alcohol
content
very
well
and
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
possibly
sour
from
either
light
or
heat
exposure
unfortunately
thats
the
major
taste
profile
i
get
initially
and
its
a
turn
off
even
though
the
secondary
and
finishing
notes
are
so
strong
im
going
to
rate
this
well
regardless
of
its
sourness
because
it
was
in
fact
still
good
not
great
not
perfect
not
up
to
par
with
its
older
brother
westmalle
triple
this
beers
age
and
improper
storage
may
have
led
to
the
bottles
accelerating
decline
these
usually
have
a
great
cellaring
history
well
regardless
i
would
still
recommend

a
pleasant
dubbel
but
nothing
particularly
stood
out
to
me
the
taste
is
together
with
the
drinkability
what
makes
this
beer
a
difficult
one
to
make
ones
tatse
buds
to
it
way
too
carbonated
even
for
a
belgian
brew
i
shall
give
it
a
try
leaving
it
at
least
a
couple
of
months
in
the
cellar
thats
why
it
is
that
high
my
overall
grade
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
a
fine
example
of
a
true
belgian
abbey
dubbel
if
youve
never
had
this
beer
you
are
missing
out
bitter
taste
medium
thick
body
bitterness
stays
in
your
mouth
quite
carbonated
overall
not
bad
quite
average
mouthfeel
has
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
very
nice
medium
carbination
easy
to
drink
overall
i
would
opine
that
this
is
certainly
a
classy
trappistbelgian
dubbel
im
surprised
that
its
taken
me
so
long
to
get
around
to
sampling
this
and
the
tripel
slightly
underwhelmed
but
not
disappointed
definitely
yummy
stuff
i
tried
this
beer
a
week
ago
over
all
a
great
beer
had
a
malty
and
hoppy
feel
taste
and
smell
slightly
bitter
with
a
smell
of
omami
had
a
medium
hold
on
the
glass
the
texture
and
taste
was
creamy
with
a
hint
of
coco
and
dried
fruits
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
a
beer
that
is
not
to
bitter
or
sweet
rather
perfectly
balanced
have
fun
pours
a
slightly
murky
dark
brown
with
a
3
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
craggy
cap
a
nice
pattern
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
bready
malt
dark
fruits
especially
grapes
and
sweet
candi
sugar
taste
is
of
slight
candi
sugar
and
dark
fruits
plum
prune
grape
raisin
up
front
with
a
bready
malt
aftertaste
there
is
a
slight
earthy
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
dubbel
and
one
of
the
best
trappist
beers
i
have
tried
so
far
o
my
first
dubbel
and
i
am
not
disappointed
nice
drink
that
is
sold
at
every
supermarket
single
finger
head
with
no
real
retention
with
some
lacing
cloudy
maroon
body
nice
sweet
cherry
and
strawberry
with
yeast
esters
more
dark
fruit
in
the
flavor
mostly
raisin
and
cherry
belgian
yeast
and
mild
spice
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
i
like
how
the
aroma
is
more
than
a
generic
dark
fruit
aroma
with
individual
flavors
noted
11
2
ounce
bottle
into
chalice
bottled

pours
hazy
and
cloudy
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
fairly
dense
khaki
head
with
fantastic
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thick
cap
that
lasts
some
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
well
with
plenty
of
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
creating
a
creamier
head
than
on
the
pour
aromas
of
huge
raisin
caramel
molasses
prunes
biscuit
roasted
nuts
light
chocolate
and
yeast
spices
big
malty
aromas
here
with
good
strength
and
balance
taste
of
big
caramel
molasses
pepper
chocolate
roasted
nut
biscuit
dark
fruit
and
spicy
yeast
lingering
notes
of
biscuit
caramel
chocolate
pepper
and
yeast
spices
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
nice
malty
flavor
with
no
cloying
and
less
spiciness
than
i
was
expecting
from
the
yeast
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
drinks
incredibly
easily
with
the
high
carbonation
as
well
alcohol
is
essentially
non
existent
with
only
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
dubbel
style
as
i
would
have
expected
great
balance
of
flavors
and
dangerously
drinkable
so
far
this
westmalle
and
the
rochefort
8
are
the
two
best
dubbels
that
i
have
sampled
so
far
i
hope
one
day
to
give
each
of
the
trappist
dubbels
a
try
but
until
then
this
still
remains
one
of
my
most
favorite
beers
complex
malts
on
the
tongue
plenty
of
raisin
fig
brown
sugar
and
pleasing
warm
alcohol
only
ding
is
a
bit
of
bite
on
the
back
end
not
sure
it
was
even
taste
so
much
as
being
what
i
consider
slightlyovercarbed
regardless
a
spectacular
beer
always
enjoy
revisiting
this
one
o
a
nice
dubbel
pretty
well
rounded
best
ive
ever
had
no
still
good
tho
overall
this
is
tasty
dubbel
thats
not
too
heavy
and
quite
drinkable
probably
the
best
dubbel
out
there
definitely
my
new
favorite
o
i
havent
tried
the
dubbel
in
about
5
years
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
the
drinkability
is
better
than
i
remember
but
maybe
that
is
also
its
downfall
as
there
is
nothing
too
complex
in
the
taste
and
is
the
reason
i
do
not
grab
one
of
these
very
often
overall
a
very
good
beer
needs
some
time
to
develop
into
a
sweeter
less
bitter
complex
and
interesting
beer
not
so
interesting
when
young
but
i
now
its
full
potential
overall
i
think
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
one
it
has
tremendous
balance
and
is
very
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
wow
factor
still
worth
a
try
though
o
a
great
belgian
that
i
just
want
plot
be
more
estery
in
the
body
oanyone
looking
to
make
a
dubbelthis
would
be
a
good
one
to
try
to
mimicfantastic
beer
great
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
love
this
onemy
favorite
of
the
style
loved
the
price
and
availability
in
belgium
toowish
i
could
have
brought
cases
of
this
stuff
home
with
me
o
good
flavor
but
i
will
probably
do
without
buying
anymore
not
my
thing
mediumbrown
milky
appearance
light
brown
head
that
was
solid
and
longlasting
plenty
of
champagnestyle
bubbles
nose
was
herbal
perfumy
some
citrus
notes
taste
was
mildly
hoppy
with
herbal
and
spicy
notes
mouthfeel
was
smooth
not
thin
not
heavy
wellbalanced
robust
flavor
o
overall
a
nice
belgian
dubbel
and
very
good
for
the
price
and
availability
some
nice
dark
fruits
in
the
nose
and
something
id
certainly
buy
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
dubbel
overall
pretty
much
a
flawless
example
of
what
these
trappist
monasteries
put
forth
in
their
splendid
dubbels
it
has
everything
that
this
kind
of
beer
is
supposed
to
have
and
adds
a
nice
twist
with
a
more
grapey
character
than
you
would
normally
see
it
goes
wonderfully
with
cheese
and
by
itself
very
easy
to
enjoy
about
the
only
bad
thing
i
could
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
not
the
very
best
i
have
had
but
with
that
said
it
is
certainly
up
there
with
many
other
great
ales
a
smooth
and
pleasant
dubbel
m
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
its
a
little
too
watery
an
a
little
overcarbonated
overall
westmalle
dubbel
is
a
trademark
depiction
of
the
style
and
is
a
superb
dry
belgian
brown
ale
artfully
crafted
and
truly
remarkable
overall
westmalle
never
fails
to
deliver
being
such
an
incredible
belgian
brewery
for
so
many
years
makes
it
hard
for
anyone
to
complain
about
this
brown
ale
wonderfully
complex
and
consistent
every
time
a
dark
stern
dubbel
with
a
plethora
of
flavors
to
be
enjoyed
taste
is
fruity
and
yeasty
dark
fruit
berries
and
even
a
tad
sour
a
little
funky
and
musty
too
superb
and
wish
these
were
more
widely
available
and
a
little
more
inexpensive
as
it
is
a
treat
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
a
tasty
dubbel
but
not
my
favourite
maybe
this
one
was
a
bit
overripe
but
certainly
a
complex
flavour
profile
any
fan
of
the
style
would
not
be
disappointed
by
this
brew
but
comparatively
ive
had
better
o
a
classic
dubbel
this
wasnt
the
best
one
ive
had
but
i
cant
really
find
anything
that
wrong
with
it
either
i
would
drink
this
again
any
day
im
glad
this
opened
my
eyes
to
what
dubbels
should
really
be
i
imagine
sitting
in
a
craftsman
house
designed
by
frank
lloyd
wright
with
a
fire
blazing
after
a
light
and
tasty
dinner
on
a
friday
night
in
the
winter
i
just
leaf
through
an
old
magazine
while
listening
to
some
acoustic
music
like
john
cages
compositions
for
string
quartet
or
larry
coryells
bolero
cd
pours
a
beige
allhead
which
leaves
a
lasting
floating
merengue
hazy
rusty
brown
body
smell
has
malt
caramel
and
fig
taste
repeats
the
smell
but
also
adds
some
sour
rye
body
is
lighter
than
i
expected
medium
weight
at
best
alcohol
seems
even
higher
than
the
7
reported
on
the
bottle
all
in
all
a
good
dubbel
but
on
the
hot
side
mouthfeel
is
rich
what
you
would
expect
in
a
dubbel
overall
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
restrained
i
dont
see
it
as
a
top
100
beer
of
fame
beer
d
overall
im
not
really
in
love
with
this
a
bit
weak
as
far
as
dubbels
go
i
would
look
elsewhere
for
solid
examples
not
bad
by
any
means
just
not
great
overall
just
a
classic
beer
that
will
always
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
o
good
example
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
off
for
me
and
some
of
the
flavors
are
a
bit
tough
to
pick
out
part
of
the
fun
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
imo
4
overall
very
enjoyable
it
definitely
stands
up
even
more
considering
its
price
and
availability
if
i
have
any
caution
with
this
beer
it
is
to
be
concerned
with
what
food
you
pair
it
with
it
can
be
overwhelmed
by
strong
spicy
food
to
the
point
where
you
might
miss
the
complexities
of
this
beer
take
my
advice
and
order
simply
or
better
yet
enjoy
this
beer
with
an
open
chalice
allowing
the
aroma
to
breathe
take
it
slow
and
enjoy
it
on
its
own
youll
be
glad
you
did
overall
i
am
wishing
i
could
say
more
about
how
this
tastes
but
it
tastes
like
drink
club
soda
and
nothing
else
pretty
darn
disappointing
cause
the
nose
is
fantastic
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruits
and
a
small
note
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
dark
fruits
a
small
caramel
like
presence
and
just
a
note
of
alcohol
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
and
lightly
sticky
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
almost
quad
like
caramel
is
sticky
sweet
and
a
nice
coffee
note
very
nice
o
good
dubbel
but
nothing
earthshattering
but
maybe
i
am
missing
something
here
o
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
its
by
far
my
favorite
dubbel
and
i
dont
think
anything
else
ive
tried
even
comes
close
sadly
its
taken
me
several
years
to
get
around
to
reviewing
this
just
as
im
lagging
behind
on
reviewing
everything
else
ive
tried
but
i
decided
to
pop
one
open
tonight
and
share
my
thoughts
the
price
is
very
reasonable
as
well
particularly
when
considering
the
pricier
offerings
that
cant
manage
to
come
close
as
far
as
quality
solid
dubbel
this
has
all
the
elements
of
why
i
love
belgian
beer
its
fruity
and
spicy
and
has
that
nice
candy
sugar
flavor
i
have
come
to
like
it
does
seem
more
like
a
cold
weather
beer
but
one
i
would
happily
try
any
time
of
year
good
stuff
a
complex
flavorful
treat
o
its
like
fine
art
that
you
can
take
out
of
the
fridge
and
enjoy
i
look
forward
to
more
of
these
in
the
future
llove
this
beer
underappreciated
slow
drinker
like
your
suppose
to
drink
beer
for
the
mature
drinker
classic
dubbel
with
dryness
like
champagne
goes
well
with
cheese
pastries
my
wife
makes
expensive
even
if
you
can
find
a
deal
three
is
usually
all
i
can
drink
this
is
not
for
the
chugger
dont
leave
in
your
freezer
more
than
an
hour
or
you
have
a
slushywhich
still
tastes
awesome
ive
discovered
that
if
you
wait
till
you
get
close
to
the
expiration
date
on
the
back
it
becomes
sweeter
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
enjoy
please
try
with
patience
o
a
beautiful
complex
beer
that
can
easily
be
enjoyed
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
almost
6
a
bottle
i
was
expecting
much
more
seems
to
be
lacking
the
richness
and
fuller
body
typical
of
the
style
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
but
i
doubt
i
would
buy
this
again
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
red
highlight
to
it
and
a
tan
colored
head
the
lacing
was
light
but
stuck
fairly
well
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
slightly
sweet
the
taste
of
some
earthy
malts
and
dark
sweet
fruits
take
over
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
really
quite
nice
its
very
smooth
had
a
creamy
body
to
it
and
goes
down
really
easy
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
a
style
that
im
not
overly
crazy
about
but
i
find
this
one
to
be
an
exception
o
somewhat
clean
straight
forward
beer
but
very
drinkable
and
inviting
beer
i
like
the
non
sweetness
classic
overall
this
is
an
extremely
wellmade
dubbel
and
should
be
the
model
for
all
others
in
its
category
o
a
pretty
nice
ale
but
i
would
stick
with
much
better
belgian
offerings
maybe
im
not
a
fan
of
the
dubbel
style
or
maybe
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
overall
a
triumph
of
a
beer
so
many
flavours
and
aromas
to
mull
over
not
to
mention
how
easy
it
goes
down
this
was
truly
well
worth
the
wait
believe
the
hype
simply
delicious
pours
a
dark
brown
variably
cloudy
depending
on
your
pour
with
a
cap
of
foamy
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
and
laces
moderately
well
dark
sugars
and
dark
dried
fruits
in
the
aroma
taste
is
woody
bready
yeasty
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
caramel
dried
fruits
raisins
figs
and
the
like
some
banana
and
spice
moments
slip
in
once
in
a
while
mediumbodied
and
very
nice
to
drink
though
i
prefer
its
elder
sibling
the
tripel
overall
pretty
interesting
and
a
good
brew
in
general
worth
the
try
o
im
not
generally
a
dubbel
fan
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
excellent
dubble
complex
medium
bodied
and
interesting
easy
and
enjoyable
drink
o
a
very
nice
beer
still
just
scratching
the
surface
in
terms
of
dubbels
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
soon
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
one
stacks
up
to
chimay
rochefort
etc
o
a
very
well
crafted
trappist
dubbel
however
i
still
prefer
the
chimay
premiere
red
over
this
but
this
still
is
a
class
brew
outside
the
rochefort
brews
both
this
and
the
chimay
are
2
of
the
best
dubbels
available
and
are
fairly
easy
to
find
in
the
small
populated
area
i
live
in
remember
you
cant
go
wrong
with
belgian
trappists
they
are
brewed
with
quality
in
mind
and
this
one
is
no
different
it
goes
right
in
line
as
another
world
class
trappist
the
cpj
scores
are
for
the
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
to
tan
colored
head
the
smell
is
rich
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
a
slightly
belgian
yeast
smell
the
flavor
follows
suit
but
is
fairly
mellow
and
well
blended
together
bthe
carbonation
is
medium
and
a
medium
body
to
it
noverall
this
is
a

to
a
beer
its
only
competitor
in
its
class
would
be
trappistes
rochfort
number
8
both
are
great
beers
and
for
the
cost
in
my
area
you
wont
find
any
better
unless
you
want
to
up
your
price
extremely
solid
dubbel
although
for
the
price
id
usually
pick
a
rochefort
8
instead
overall
very
good
dubbel
definitely
will
be
drinking
this
again
nice
complex
flavor
and
the
abvs
are
hide
nicely
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
just
have
to
try
at
least
once
very
very
nice
overall
a
bit
more
body
a
little
less
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
little
more
sweetness
and
it
would
have
been
a
5
o
this
gets
big
point
for
having
all
the
peripheral
qualities
of
a
dubbel
but
bringing
in
a
unique
flavour
profile
that
makes
it
more
interesting
than
the
typical
offering
i
see
a
repeat
purchase
in
my
future
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
decentsized
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
raisins
and
cherries
with
some
nice
brown
sugar
notes
i
also
get
some
yeast
notes
the
flavor
is
not
as
fruit
as
the
aroma
i
get
some
raisins
and
plum
notes
but
what
is
more
prevalent
is
the
toffee
from
the
malt
the
yeast
is
also
present
in
the
flavor
there
is
some
brown
sugar
flavor
but
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
overall
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
world
classic
beer
that
never
disappoints
do
remarkably
drinkable
its
balanced
light
bittersweet
and
enjoyable
i
would
gladly
follow
this
beer
up
with
another
overall
worth
a
shot
but
i
have
to
wonder
if
sitting
for
a
couple
of
years
may
ease
the
sharpness
of
the
body
which
is
easily
my
least
favorite
aspect
of
this
beer
my
favorite
regular
belgian
beer
and
definitely
my
favorite
dubbel
westmalle
dubbel
pours
a
typical
dark
purplebrown
ruby
red
highlights
shine
through
with
some
exuberance
when
the
beer
is
held
to
light
the
light
tan
colored
foam
maxes
out
at
over
four
fingers
in
height
and
shows
some
solid
retention
lacing
isnt
nearly
as
widespread
as
it
should
be
though
the
nose
doesnt
have
quite
the
amount
dark
fruits
than
id
like
and
the
result
is
an
aroma
thats
a
little
too
phenol
heavy
to
really
appeal
to
me
the
flavor
has
a
similar
dark
fruit
deficiency
but
unlike
the
nose
its
at
least
replaced
somewhat
by
a
toffee
note
the
clove
spicy
phenol
notes
on
the
back
end
are
intense
and
threaten
to
overwhelm
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
at
least
has
the
excellence
ive
come
to
expect
from
trappist
beers
the
body
is
beguilingly
light
for
a
beer
with
a
definite
sweetness
in
its
flavor
profile
at
the
same
time
the
carbonation
even
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
is
active
enough
to
give
the
beer
a
vibrant
energy
westmalle
dubbel
is
a
solidly
brewed
beer
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
fruity
ester
vs
phenols
balance
in
this
one
overall
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
floral
fruit
flavors
really
add
bold
sweetness
each
drink
is
balanced
sweet
with
mild
yeast
in
the
background
the
beer
is
affordable
widely
avaible
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
overall
a
fantastic
beer
the
best
dubbel
that
i
have
had
a
classic
ultimately
this
beer
ends
with
a
well
balanced
blend
of
chewy
and
almost
leathery
malts
the
balance
tips
towards
the
maltalcohol
side
but
the
hops
dash
around
in
the
background
giving
this
beer
a
bright
spunky
spark
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
beckons
for
another
taste
this
beer
is
wonderful
in
all
aspects
the
flavors
are
distinctive
and
each
sip
is
a
pleasure
this
would
pair
very
well
with
desert
foods
it
is
a
perfect
evening
beer
o
a
great
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
moderate
and
balanced
not
too
high
in
alcohol
not
too
sweet
or
too
sour
this
pours
a
hazy
brownish
color
with
a
large
light
brown
head
with
large
bubbles
which
quickly
goes
away
which
seems
to
be
different
than
most
reviewers
here
the
smell
is
nice
very
fruity
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
thickness
lots
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
good
different
than
i
expected
there
is
a
hint
of
sweetness
maybe
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
some
malts
but
then
it
finishes
dry
and
spicy
good
stuff
dr
relatively
high
abv
very
fairly
priced
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
its
very
commercially
available
and
its
high
quality
its
a
shame
people
may
try
to
make
counterfeit
westvleteren
with
the
bottles
but
the
beer
isnt
to
blame
shes
certainly
worth
a
go
if
you
like
beer
o
absolutely
lovely
overall
an
excellent
beer
though
heavier
darker
and
more
of
a
wintercold
weather
beer
than
the
tripel
overall
a
nice
beer
very
easy
to
drink
never
lets
you
down
taste
was
spicy
with
a
hint
of
fruits
like
raspberries
caramel
sweetness
on
the
end
there
were
different
flavors
developing
constantly
and
it
combined
with
great
a
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
very
impressed
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
which
isnt
my
favorite
but
im
gaining
a
new
appreciation
for
it
pours
dark
brown
with
a
light
beige
head
has
a
nice
sweet
plumraisin
aroma
the
spiced
fruity
flavor
is
coupled
with
wonderful
abbey
yeast
compliments
you
would
expect
from
this
brewery
the
body
was
very
smooth
and
went
down
far
too
easy
left
me
wanting
another
od
basic
dubble
imo
not
spectacular
but
a
nice
gateway
to
belgian
styles
i
suppose
obviously
the
beer
lost
something
on
draught
compared
to
the
bottle
but
it
was
still
alright
o
easily
the
most
enjoyable
dubbel
ive
had
to
date
the
berry
and
custard
flavours
are
really
juicy
and
vibrant
4

the
end
build
to
a
very
nice
taste
that
stays
with
you
ooverall
this
is
a
subtle
but
impressive
dubbel
itll
satisfy
any
craving
for
a
good
belgian
i
enjoyed
this
all
the
way
through
it
tastes
better
every
time
i
get
it
in
all
good
especially
with
a
ripe
goat
cheese
and
bread
this
was
sampled
and
compared
with
the

cl
bottle
pours
a
light
cola
brown
with
a
very
big
very
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
raisin
plum
some
light
licorice
some
spicy
yeast
and
very
light
alcohol
the
initial
taste
is
raisin
and
plum
this
then
goes
into
some
very
light
molasses
with
some
spicy
yeast
on
the
finish
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
pretty
dry
overall
light
body
medium
carbonation
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
a
strong
example
for
the
style
and
balances
the
candy
sugar
and
fruits
with
the
malt
backbone
very
well
the
aroma
was
nearly
spot
on
as
well
rich
notes
of
spice
dark
fruit
plums
raisins
mostly
in
the
front
as
a
nice
grainy
and
bread
like
aroma
started
to
peak
through
as
it
really
warmed
up
along
with
a
light
hint
of
a
spiced
pear
or
apple
at
the
first
sip
i
was
in
love
i
am
not
normally
a
fan
of
the
style
as
it
is
usually
rather
plain
for
me
sitting
somewhere
between
the
sessionable
and
the
extreme
but
a
whole
new
life
was
brought
forward
for
me
here
key
word
in
this
beer
was
smooth
it
was
simply
breathtakingly
smooth
and
subtle
rich
notes
of
raisins
and
plums
hints
of
light
spice
pears
great
yeast
notes
here
there
was
just
such
a
smooth
subtle
flavor
here
i
really
am
at
a
loss
as
i
rarely
find
a
beer
this
drinkable
the
long
aftertaste
was
rich
with
a
ripe
fruit
flavor
that
left
an
almost
funky
note
that
was
only
detectable
after
a
few
minutes
after
the
sip
just
a
wonderful
expierence
o
very
good
beer
very
good
dubbel
as
compared
with
chimay
premier
westmalle
is
less
fruity
drier
more
hop
bite
depends
on
your
preference
but
both
excellent
i
loved
this
one
and
once
again
another
great
trappiste
lovely
nobel
hop
aroma
with
estery
fruit
notes
many
flavors
present
bubblegum
clove
and
a
very
slight
pineapple
tartness
with
a
dry
caramel
finish
light
phenolics
and
heavy
carbonation
give
an
exuberant
mouth
feel
to
the
beer
as
expected
with
a
true
trappist
style
dubbel
very
drinkable
indeed
can
have
this
over
and
over
all
in
all
its
a
quality
dubbel
that
wont
leave
you
feeling
like
youve
just
had
a
quality
dubbel
odessert
in
a
bottle
a
great
after
dinner
beer
o
overall
a
very
solid
dubbel
that
i
would
certainly
recommend
to
a
friend
a
dark
cola
brown
with
red
highlights
and
an
espresso
cstyle
thick
creamy
head
the
belgian
yeast
is
all
over
the
place
fruity
esters
sweet
alcohal
and
warm
bread
scents
then
almost
a
candy
apple
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
medium
roasted
malts
and
warm
alcohal
notes
there
is
some
spice
and
a
bit
of
walnut
with
a
touch
of
bitter
smokiness
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
with
some
heavy
carbonation
i
feel
like
i
should
throw
on
some
flip
flops
and
a
brown
dress
the
monks
have
done
themselves
proud
this
is
a
good
european
brew
and
i
feel
quite
distinguished
drinking
this
aromatic
concoction
overall
a
good
belgian
ale
to
drink
in
the
warmer
months
o
a
must
for
belgium
dubbel
lovers
11
2oz

pours
dark
browndark
mahogany
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
khaki
head
aroma
has
candied
sugar
dark
fruit
and
sherrylike
notes
taste
is
a
sweet
malt
backbone
with
a
little
sour
and
some
hops
on
the
end
thin
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
finish
is
a
bit
dry
but
smooth
some
effervesence
not
the
best
trappist
beer
out
there
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
o
i
will
seek
this
beer
out
again
in
the
future
wont
find
it
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
unfortunately
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
about
average
for
the
style
the
real
draw
of
the
mouthfeel
is
the
thick
and
creamy
head
that
you
get
on
each
sip
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
nice
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
overall
drinkability
the
whole
is
better
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
i
really
like
this
beer
but
its
a
trappist
so
is
that
really
so
surprising
overall
despite
my
reservations
with
hyped
beers
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
actually
ordered
another
at
the
end
of
the
evening
for
a
dubbel
this
one
ranks
at
the
very
top
for
me
sets
the
bar
very
high
for
strong
ales
without
a
doubt
taste
is
surprisingly
mild
muted
cocoa
caramel
crisp
and
dry
with
a
bitter
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
one
of
the
better
dubbels
ive
had
unfortunately
the
aroma
is
a
little
better
than
the
taste
o
a
delicious
trappist
dubbel
worth
every
second
to
savor
took
the
better
part
of
an
hour
to
work
my
way
through
this
one
and
i
am
left
wondering
where
that
hour
went
a
great
journey
mediumfull
creaminess
and
a
dryness
a
great
trappist
beer
ah
now
that
i
think
about
the
mouth
feel
of
the
drink
i
can
understand
the
claim
to
high
attenuation
it
has
actually
gotten
better
as
it
warmed
but
still
not
my
ideal
trappist
choice
enjoyed
on

in
a
chalice
glass
burnt
sienna

cloudy

beige
close

low

very
well
balanced
very
soft
dry
bitterness
in
mouth
perception
of
high
level
of
alcohol
under
your
tongue
crisp
subtle
chocolate
on
the
aftertaste
surprising
beer
even
not
being
my
favourite
one
of
the
style
suggested
for
a
long
paused
drink
overall
excellent
i
think
i
might
like
this
even
more
than
chimay
grande
r√©serve
would
absolutely
love
to
have
this
on
a
regular
basis
unfortunately
it
isnt
too
common
and
isnt
cheap
either
one
of
my
top
beers
o
what
a
great
beer
a
very
complex
and
flavorful
brew
that
goes
down
smooth
not
a
bad
drop
but
ive
had
better
dubbels
and
better
trappist
dubbels
as
well
the
style
is
a
good
basis
whatever
happens
but
i
feel
this
could
have
been
better
very
complex
and
heavy
in
the
mouth
but
with
a
smooth
warm
finish
some
remaining
tartness
and
hops
coat
the
palate
hard
to
describe
this
one
just
a
master
of
the
style
and
worth
a
try
d
trappists
do
it
better
very
good
overall
d
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
as
good
in
bottle
form
as
on
tap
this
dubbel
has
a
large
billowing
white
fluffy
head
the
liquid
is
ruby
colored
and
the
head
leaves
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
belgian
yeast
all
the
way
fruity
esters
and
spicy
notes
are
at
the
forefront
kind
of
light
the
flavor
is
subtle
as
well
mimicking
the
aroma
not
as
full
and
rounded
out
as
i
would
appreciate
but
still
very
good
mouthfeel
is
great
belgian
candi
sugar
lightens
this
one
right
up
with
good
carbonation
levels
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
with
awesome
drinkability
it
is
a
pleasure
to
split
a
bomber
of
this
beer
big
deep
dark
amber
pour
not
much
on
top
head
was
prettty
thin
but
still
appealing
smell
was
a
massive
caramel
malty
sweetness
on
to
the
taste
and
well
very
malty
sweetness
as
the
nose
but
a
nice
dry
fizziness
to
finish
it
off
at
first
i
was
not
that
impressed
but
that
was
based
on
the
hype
but
as
i
drank
a
few
more
sips
it
warms
up
to
you
and
the
fizziness
on
the
end
cleans
the
pallate
and
your
ready
for
more
a
true
classic
amesome
to
pair
with
cheese
overall
i
much
prefer
this
to
the
tripel
offering
of
westmalle
trappists
this
is
probaly
largely
a
stylistic
preference
overall
this
is
just
an
amazing
beer
very
drinkable
throughout
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
o
to
me
this
was
a
good
beer
not
as
great
as
some
of
the
other
trappist
beers
out
there
but
it
holds
its
own
i
would
drink
this
one
again
a
fantastic
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
slowly
overall
another
world
class
dubbel
that
i
find
to
be
enjoyable
but
does
not
quite
knock
my
socks
off
not
sure
why
as
i
like
quads
and
belgian
strong
dark
ales
a
lot
d
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
i
just
wish
i
liked
the
flavor
more
md
medium
bodied
but
a
clean
balanced
finish
its
actually
a
challenge
to
savor
the
beer
because
it
is
so
drinkable
poured
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
tan
fizzy
head
that
was
fully
diminishing
and
had
poor
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
of
roasted
malts
and
molasses
light
resin
hops
and
a
moderate
scent
of
a
horse
blanket
yeast
it
tasted
slightly
malty
and
extremely
bitter
at
first
and
ended
with
a
bitter
acidic
flavor
that
layed
in
the
back
of
your
throat
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
overall
an
ok
brew
but
nothing
special
md
this
beer
was
a
gusher
but
it
was
not
overly
carbonated
just
the
right
amount
to
capture
the
smooth
and
creamy
nature
of
this
beer
a
lot
going
on
kept
my
interest
the
whole
way
through
highly
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
of
medium
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
will
look
for
this
again
but
the
taste
is
wonderful
with
cocao
and
coffee
notes
but
not
nearly
as
over
bearing
as
stouts
and
porters
usually
are
with
those
flavors
with
an
amazingly
creamy
mouth
feel
and
no
off
notes
anywhere
in
my
experience
with
the
beer
absolutely
wonderful
drinkability
as
a
huge
dubbel
fan
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
could
drink
this
guy
all
day
that
being
said
it
may
be
a
tad
too
sweet
for
more
than
a
single
bomber
in
one
sitting
dvery
drinkable
done
with
me
taste
in
no
time
pours
a
yellowish
brown
a
good
amount
of
offwhite
head
dissipates
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
sweet
and
floral
lots
of
yeasty
smells
as
well
tastes
sweet
and
floral
the
yeast
blends
well
with
malty
sweetness
thick
solid
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
incredibly
tasty
a
pleasant
surprise
i
was
expecting
to
like
doubles
less
than
i
like
triples
but
quite
the
contrary
very
drinkable
considering
the
sytl
d
drink
this
beer
pours
a
lovely
amber
brown
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
remains
as
a
layer
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
smell
is
mostly
malts
and
fruit
with
a
bit
of
yeast
but
smooth
taste
is
lovely
with
gentle
sweet
malts
up
front
with
medium
fruit
that
smoothly
blends
into
a
nice
light
hop
bitterness
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
but
nicely
coating
extremely
drinkable
could
drink
this
stuff
for
hours
the
taste
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
on
this
one
less
rich
than
other
dubbels
ive
had
overall
a
fantastic
beer
but
not
my
favorite
dark
trappist
worth
seeking
out
though
overall
wonderfully
mild
but
tasty
dubbel
another
great
belgian
creation
pours
very
dark
brown
and
clear
with
an
impressive
offwhite
head
smells
of
malt
and
light
yeast
with
some
green
applelike
scents
tastes
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
plum
and
very
light
alcohol
notes
and
the
noble
hops
trademark
touch
of
bitterness
without
the
offputting
pine
needle
cut
soft
and
nice
carbonation
with
a
great
drinkability
factor
due
to
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
my
personal
favorite
dubbel
style
in
the
solar
system
if
only
they
were
all
made
this
way
d
quite
a
nice
change
from
the
hop
bombs
i
usually
drink

think
this
would
pare

as

exceptionally

d
a

not

i
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
brew
d
nice

balance
a
touch
boozy
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
very
good
beer
here
its
about
time
that
i
finally
put
my
thoughts
of
this
beer
down
on
paper
digital
paper
it
pours
out
a
dark
brownmahogany
color
with
a
beautiful
head
that
leaves
a
great
ring
of
lace
the
head
retention
is
unreal
the
smell
is
wonderful
raisin
plum
slight
alcohol
and
a
slight
sweet
spociness
the
taste
is
similar
super
complex
yet
still
delicate
it
has
a
mediumfull
mouthfeel
i
dont
want
this
beer
to
end
drinkability
great
sipper
one
of
those
beers
that
really
demands
your
attention
to
enjoy
not
a
casual
beer
drink
above
55
degrees
in
my
opinion
and
pay
attention
to
the
subtleties
as
it
warms
to
near
room
temperature
youll
be
glad
you
did
d
good
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
definitely
is
good
wouldnt
session
this
beer
but
for
the
price
it
is
to
acquire
that
wouldnt
be
an
option
for
me
anyway
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
sweet
and
subtly
robust
aroma
the
notes
in
the
nose
complexly
blend
together
to
leave
much
to
be
desired
in
the
taste
here
it
was
a
bit
underwhelming
and
the
feel
was
surprisingly
light
as
you
sip
however
it
is
quite
creamy
right
off
the
edge
of
the
glass
making
you
want
to
go
back
for
another
satisfying
sip
on
the
lips
my
favorite
trappist
to
date
d
train
could
drink
this
brew
all
the
way
down
the
line
the
drinkabilty
is
superb
for
it
gets
better
and
better
with
every
sip
and
as
it
gradually
warms
further
enhancing
the
flavor
trappist
should
be
its
own
group
on
the
food
pyramid
despite
the
cost
and
trouble
to
find
it
in
the
states
i
wouldnt
mind
having
one
every
day
i
have
not
experienced
a
beer
quite
like
this
it
is
different
than
other
dubbels
ive
had
yet
possesses
recurrent
similarities
that
make
it
unmistakably
belgian
the
beer
would
pair
nicely
with
a
variety
of
foods
because
it
offers
complexity
yet
balance
and
therefore
would
not
detract
heavily
i
liked
the
beer
at
a
slightly
cooler
temperature
4550
degrees
fahrenheit
recommended
but
i
wonder
how
room
temperature
would
have
suited
a
year
past
its
declared
bb
date
the
westmalle
dubbel
is
mainly
distinguished
from
his
above
reviewed
younger
brother
by
more
pronounced
sweetness
enhancing
the
maltperception
absence
of
fruity
tartness
and
poorly

less

d
flavour
is
rather
stronger
than
expected
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
some
other
dubbels
definitely
no
chocolatetype
flavours
here
only
a
touch
of
sweet
sugar
but
dominated
by
a
darker
bockstyle
taste
my
first
evidence
that
not
all
trappist
beers
are
nectar
from
god
after
recently
acquiring
a
job
bartending
at
a
belgian
bar
in
new
york
i
have
been
delighted
with
my
exposure
to
new
beers
and
with
a
full
immersion
of
the
belgian
styles
i
have
since
taken
a
new
favorite
westmalle
dubbel
everything
about
this
beer
is
amazing
i
love
the
mouthfeel
and
could
drink
this
beer
alone
with
food
on
a
cold
day
or
in
an
alley
and
i
would
be
happy
i
feel
that
the
carbonation
combined
with
the
subtle
notes
of
chocolate
and
malt
just
make
an
explosion
of
flavor
that
surprised
me
the
first
time
i
drank
one
i
was
a
huge
fan
of
the
triple
and
randomly
tried
the
dubbel
and
soon
found
a
new
favorite
the
proper
pour
in
the
proper
glass
just
gives
me
a
happy
feeling
every
time
i
return
to
it
combine
this
with
the
traditional
belgian
carbonnades
flammandes
for
an
exceptional
dinner
d
very
drinkable
beer
one
of
my
personal
favorite
dubbels
well
balanced
no
overwhelming
flavors
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
setting
drinks
very
well
ill
definitely
have
this
one
again
o
a
great
dubbel
that
lacks
the
sharp
often
peppery
spiciness
of
others
in
this
style
very
drinkable
with
mild
pleasing
flavors
and
drymoderate
finish
malt
is
accentuated
due
to
low
spiciness
for
the
style
my
favorite
dubbel
at
the
moment
d
this
is
truly
a
gem
and
being
the
original
dubbel
it
certainly
sets
a
high
benchmark
for
what
should
be
expected
from
the

that

i
will

again
a

beer
to

ponder
life
or
have
with
an
excellent
steak
opinion
thus
far
i
have
not
been
a
big
fan
of
dubbels
i
keep
trying
them
because
i
assume
that
i
will
find
the
right
one
this
beer
is
probably
one
my
favorites
so
far
it
isnt
too
estery
which
is
my
contention
with
most
of
the
others
i
havent
tried
that
many
yet
so
i
dont
have
nearly
the
opinion
on
dubbels
as
tripels
this
is
still
a
mighty
fine
brew
and
one
that
i
am
sure
i
will
be
drinking
again
in
the
future
pours
an
opaque
dark
mahogany
with
a
light
tan
head
that
gushes
up
to
fill
the
glass
excellent
retention
that
leaves
patchy
lacing
the
dark
fruit
aroma
is
strongest
raisins
and
plums
coupled
with
chocolate
malt
and
traces
of
noble
hops
roasted
malt
and
sharp
fruit
esters
make
the
flavor
both
acidic
and
sweet
but
never
astringent
a
crisp
hoppy
aftertaste
balances
the
pronounced
malt
flavor
and
dries
out
the
residual
sweetness
for
a
clean
finish
the
complex
flavors
complimented
by
a
velvetly
smooth
mouthfeel
provide
a
more
than
adequate
drinkabilty
despite
the
full
body
and
alcoholic
strength
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
soft
and
luscious
changes
character
quite
a
bit
as
it
warms
a
little
this
one
is
worth
setting
out
for
a
few
minutes
a
very
nice
dubbel
one
of
the
best
ive
found
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
im
glad
my
first
experience
with
it
is
a
fresh
version
that
i
can
tell
has
been
handled
well
ill
definitely
revisit
this
one
as
dubbels
go
its
hard
to
beat
something
like
this
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
pours
out
a
deep
rubytinted
brown
with
a
halfinch
of
solid
tannish
head
nose
is
gorgeous
a
sweet
fruity
scents
with
a
full
malt
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
unboiled
wort
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
rich
dark
malt
unusually
malty
compared
to
most
dubbels
caramalized
fruit
raisins
plums
along
with
lightly
spicy
phenolic
notes
the
finish
is
somewhat
roasty
balancing
things
out
nicely
full
even
bodied
with
a
neutral
texture
drinkability
is
simply
some
of
the
best
stuff
on
earth
i
am
going
to
go
drink
the
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
i
am
not
joking
about
that
poured
into
a
chalice
and
had
a
nice
dark
brown
slightly
reddish
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
smell
was
mostly
caramel
with
hints
of
alcohol
smell
was
a
sign
of
trouble
ahead
did
not
care
for
the
taste
at
all
caramel
flavor
was
overpowering
and
did
not
mask
the
alcohol
taste
needs
a
bit
more
body
and
complexity
felt
harsh
on
the
mouth
and
actually
struggled
to
finish
it
i
just
may
not
be
a
fan
of
dubbels
so
take
this
for
what
it
is
worth
overall
a
phenomenal
beer
drinkability
the
alcohol
punch
is
not
hidden
well
this
inhibits
the
drinkability
a
tad
and
this
is
one
to
savor
nicely
done
decent
belgian
not
as
tasty
as
i
hoped
but
rather
easy
to
drink
id
buy
this
in
a
store
but
probably
not
at
a
bar
again
as
it
set
me
back
eight
bucks
worth
it
once
westmalle
dubbel
oozes
quality
patience
and
focus
is
required
to
plump
the
depths
of
its
beer
soul
but
the
effort
will
be
rewarded
this
is
a
more
than
worthy
member
of
the
canon
of
great
belgian
dubbels
very
approachable
drinkability
only
suffers
because
there
is
so
much
flavour
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
enough
dubbel
the
smell
is
wonderful
and
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
live
up
the
the
expectations
set
by
the
nose
on
this
one
pured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
thick
foamy
head
had
a
really
good
dark
fruity
raisinplum
matly
sugar
and
a
little
alcohol
smell
was
expecting
more
from
the
taste
after
how
good
it
smelled
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
had
a
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
worth
trying
atleast
once
this
is
good
drinkability
is
good
as
well
there
is
some
noticable
alchohol
but
this
is
a
rare
treat
that
will
get
the
job
done
of
fulfilling
the
craving
for
a
dubbel
an
inch
of
bubbly
tan
sticky
head
caps
a
nice
dark
brown
beer
with
red
edges
holy
smokes
what
a
complex
nose
sweet
malty
yeasty
bubblegum
bready
goodness
delicious
before
ive
even
tasted
it
the
front
is
a
buttery
spicy
yeastorama
fruity
in
the
middle
with
bubblegum
vanilla
icing
and
dark
caramel
yeasty
bready
fruity
finish
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
woody
with
alcohol
quite
red
winelike
absolutely
delicious
sweet
but
not
cloying
bubblegum
malty
yeasty
vanilla
icing
wow
again
the
smell
is
of
yeast
and
sweet
malt
and
caramel
and
toffee
there
is
not
extreme
complexity
but
enough
to
keep
the
drinker
interested
the
inital
taste
is
of
sweet
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
honey
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
aftertaste
is
superb
there
is
absolutely
no
hint
of
alcohol
here
this
is
simply
amazing
as
you
swirl
this
around
your
chalice
you
think
to
yourself
why
is
god
so
cruel
that
this
does
not
come
in
pints
perhaps
in
heaven
the
only
con
for
me
was
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
biting
in
the
middle
but
hardly
a
complaint
highly
reccomended
a
delicate
yet
strong
beer
one
to
enjoy
during
a
quiet
focused
time
overall
at
last
fresh
westmalle
is
now
available
in
the
usa
i
had
experienced
way
too
many
old
bottles
in
the
past
over
here
old
musty
aged
mishandled
and
poorly
transported
¬ñ
this
alone
has
the
been
the
single
reason
why
i
never
submitted
a
beer
review
for
either
the
westmalle
dubbel
or
tripel
since
joining
ba
simply
because
i
knew
how
good
this
could
be
i
find
merchant
du
vin
are
a
little
pricey
at
times
but
that
said
i
had
no
problems
paying
a
little
extra
for
a
good
fresh
bottle
in
short
in
the
us
if
it
doesn¬ít
say
mdv
on
the
reverse
label
my
advice
would
be
to
put
it
back
on
the
shelf
if
it
does
say
imported
by
mdv
on
the
reverse
label
¬ñ
pick
it
up
and
remind
yourself
how
good
this
one
is
i
think
i¬íll
pick
up
another
westmalle
goblet
when
i
see
one
to
celebrate
the
return
of
fresh
westmalle
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
small
crispy
bite
from
the
carbonation
chocolate
dates
and
hints
of
spice
collaborate
to
engorge
the
toungue
hidden
underneath
is
the
alcohol
sweet
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
underneath
overall
one
of
my
favorite
belgiums
great
offering
from
the
monks
at
trappist
pours
a
wellcarbonated
clear
mahogany
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
leaves
a
small
film
and
good
lace
considering
the
abv
smells
sweetly
malty
raisins
and
bananas
on
a
grainy
and
spicy
base
a
nice
progression
of
flavors
ride
strong
carbonation
and
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
starts
sweet
and
slightly
sticky
with
plenty
of
chocolate
and
raisins
builds
into
a
drier
and
more
grainy
middle
notable
spicy
hops
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
extremely
dry
and
crisp
much
drier
more
strongly
hopped
and
more
quenching
than
i
remember
from
previous
samples
excellent
brew
too
bad
it
cost
me
5
bucks
for
330
ml
bottle
incidentally
one
of
the
2
bottles
i
drank
had
a
raised
relief
writing
over
which
the
label
was
applied
think
its
probably
an
earlier
bottle
so
i
hung
on
to
it
sad
i
know
dark
cherry
brown
body
with
a
tan
head
that
faded
but
laced
a
bit
of
sediment
that
looks
like
coffee
grinds
even
a
stronge
and
somewhat
surprising
bakers
chocolate
on
the
nose
the
abv
came
through
too
but
not
nearly
as
strong
as
some
other
trappists
ive
had
very
pleasant
on
the
nose
a
mix
of
black
cherry
bits
of
chocolate
cane
sugar
and
a
very
light
sensation
of
lemon
zest
on
the
tongue
no
acidity
to
speak
of
but
a
creamy
and
thick
feeling
with
a
slight
oily
aftertastefeel
very
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
poured
out
of
a
11
2
oz
bottle
with
a
112505
best
by
date
into
a
tulip
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
tinges
of
purple
and
a
mammoth
beige
head
moderate
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
bubblegum
plums
apples
hay
and
of
musty
yeast
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
reminded
me
of
cherry
flavored
gum
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
towards
the
finish
alcohol
is
more
evident
than
it
needs
to
be
for
7
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
and
effervescentit
hardly
feels
like
your
drinking
anything
not
a
bad
beer
my
any
stretch
but
for
the
high
price
of
a
trappist
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
few
i
tried
that
just
isnt
worth
it
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
more
sweetness
and
bursting
flavors
still
worthy
of
some
praise
cascading
from
its
distinctively
shaped
westmalle
bottle
this
dubbel
sits
before
me
enticing
me
to
learn
its
secrets
hazy
deep
amber
brown
is
its
hue
and
it
is
filled
with
free
floating
solid
matter
khaki
colored
head
crops
up
huge
and
then
dies
down
to
a
manangeable
level
the
head
is
composed
of
small
and
distinct
tightly
knit
bubbles
malty
aroma
hints
at
dark
fruit
and
apples
below
the
bread
surface
at
first
i
am
taken
aback
by
the
huge
crisp
carbonation
concentrating
on
this
ethereal
tasting
experience
i
am
confronted
by
a
metric
ton
of
bready
malt
at
the
beginning
of
the
taste
going
deeper
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
are
revealed
to
me
leading
into
luscious
ripe
fruits
some
nuttiness
graces
my
palate
all
of
this
amid
streaks
of
a
woody
smokiness
herbal
and
earthy
notes
frolic
about
setting
the
stage
for
some
spicy
and
biting
citrous
hops
that
boldy
make
a
stand
finish
is
toasty
malt
mixed
with
very
bitter
lemon
and
orange
peel
hop
glory
there
is
a
pronounced
acidity
in
the
finish
as
well
lending
a
vinous
quality
as
stated
before
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
moving
this
taste
along
with
brisk
carbonation
fantastically
complex
this
brew
is
meant
to
be
sipped
and
analyzed
not
quaffed
as
i
reflect
upon
the
greatness
that
is
westmalle
i
am
content
with
a
single
glass
of
this
liquid
alchemy
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
generously
sharing
this
fine
beer
a
3
5
for
drinkability
because
its
good
but
not
a
session
beer
and
at
4
99
a
bottle
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
for
a
long
while
too
many
others
to
try
too
hazy
murky
light
chocolate
brown
with
a
large
head
the
foam
fell
to
a
table
after
a
minute
or
so
some
lace
smell
is
dark
fruits
and
not
much
else
not
a
big
nose
either
taste
is
all
bubbly
candi
and
malt
up
front
with
some
candied
yeast
following
finish
is
creamy
slick
and
carbonic
medium
mouthfeel
pleasant
drink
but
at
5
per
330ml
this
is
nowhere
near
a
bargain
im
thinking
those
boys
at
unibroue
got
something
going
on
that
i
like
better
than
what
the
monks
are
doing
and
theyre
doing
it
a
whole
lot
cheaper
330
ml
bottle
conditioned
best
before
72006
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
chimay
chalice
the
body
is
a
deep
brownishred
and
the
fluffy
tan
head
peaks
at
1
inch
leaving
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
wonderful
aroma
figs
plums
cherries
molasses
yeast
bananas
bandaids
lots
of
phenols
with
a
candy
sweetness
the
flavor
has
all
this
plus
a
mild
bitterness
warming
with
a
full
body
that
starts
off
fairly
carbonated
but
becomes
smooth
very
nice
ale
wish
it
didnt
cost
5
a
bottle
this
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
deep
brown
in
color
slightly
hazy
with
mild
copperorange
highlights
it
was
topped
by
a
tan
head
composed
of
dense
bubbles
the
nose
has
a
great
yeastdough
character
backed
by
the
malt
in
the
form
of
caramel
and
an
earthy
finish
the
flavor
has
the
same
caramel
malt
and
the
earthy
tones
are
even
more
enhanced
towards
the
finish
some
characteristics
of
wine
come
in
with
some
cabernet
and
black
cherry
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
up
front
but
a
sharp
finish
as
some
citrus
hop
kicks
in
dubbel
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
drinkability
its
five
times
the
price
of
new
belgiums
version
which
i
think
blows
it
away
you
tell
me
thanks
to
stonecrusher
for
the
trade
new
to
reviewing
but
i
had
to
say
this
about
this
beer
wow
i
was
given
a
bottle
and
now
i
cant
wait
to
find
more
definitely
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
tried
and
the
one
thing
that
i
can
say
to
describe
this
lucious
nectar
is
balance
330ml
pours
ruddy
brown
with
a
swiftly
dissipating
possibly
due
to
the
pint
glass
head
which
has
variedsize
bubbles
of
very
light
tan
scent
is
lightly
alcoholic
phenolic
perhaps
raspberryno
blackberry
smooth
malty
esthery
taste
all
over
generally
light
i
look
forward
to
the
tripel
for
more
intensity
nice
but
not
the
best
i
was
not
displeased
with
this
double
i
was
however
caught
off
guard
by
the
excessive
alcohol
taste
but
after
a
few
sips
from
my
westmalle
chalice
i
quite
enjoyed
this
brew
from
notes
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
the
nose
was
molasses
sweet
wtih
some
grape
rind
and
fig
characters
with
a
slight
sugary
sweetness
the
flavor
was
figgy
slightly
souring
on
the
finish
and
a
little
light
on
the
flavor
for
me
the
feel
was
moderate
and
bubbly
the
flavor
and
the
nose
were
really
nice
i
will
definately
have
to
visit
this
one
again
highly
recommended
this
brew
is
a
murky
darkbrown
color
big
tan
head
on
top
leaves
behind
some
lace
sweet
malts
on
nose
as
well
as
some
dark
fruits
sweet
caramel
malt
front
candies
fruits
alcohol
spiciness
some
bittering
effects
from
the
hops
mouth
is
full
and
round
beer
is
sweet
and
delicious
overall
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
im
really
enjoying
gonna
have
to
get
some
more
pours
a
garnet
red
into
the
westmalle
chalice
with
a
creamcoloured
head
that
diminishes
to
bubbles
along
the
surface
little
yeasty
bits
floating
about
as
well
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
in
the
nose
nice
and
complex
taste
dark
fruits
with
some
definite
nutty
hints
coming
in
before
going
back
to
the
dark
fruit
and
finishing
with
a
gentle
warming
alcohol
finish
nice
mouthfeel
and
rather
drinkable
i
approached
this
one
cautiously
after
having
sampled
an
off
tripel
but
this
was
very
tasty
and
will
be
buying
this
again
along
with
giving
the
tripel
another
go
very
nice
kind
of
a
thin
head
that
died
quickly
the
smell
of
alcohol
was
very
strong
reddish
color
with
decent
mouthfeel
it
could
maybe
use
a
few
more
bubbles
good
flavor
i
need
to
take
a
bee
tasting
classs
casue
i
cant
tell
ya
what
the
heck
the
flavors
are
definitely
a
good
representation
of
a
dubbel
i
would
buy
this
again
this
went
down
pretty
easy
but
theres
just
enough
dark
fruity
bitterness
to
keep
me
from
saying
it
went
down
like
candy
a
novice
craft
beer
drinker
might
find
it
too
bitter
for
them
but
thats
not
saying
much
for
me
its
just
fine
made
a
nice
beer
for
christening
my
st
bernardus
goblet
too
since
i
cant
find
any
st
bs
around
here
at
the
moment
body
is
medium
and
thirst
quenching
easy
carbonation
creamy
texture
finish
with
some
dry
oaky
sherry
notes
and
spicy
hops
a
delightful
dubbel
in
every
respect
a
benchmark
of
the
style
appearance
is
dark
brown
and
poured
a
fine
3
finger
head
not
leaving
much
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
so
very
interesting
primarily
detecting
the
sweet
fruits
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
vanilla
taste
is
of
sweet
wonderful
malts
and
finishes
with
a
ever
so
subtle
dry
hop
and
hint
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
full
and
pleasantly
lively
on
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
near
perfect
easy
to
take
in
all
the
complexities
it
has
to
offer
overal
i
think
this
scores
a
4
0
not
a
dubbel
i
would
seek
out
but
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
very
good
dubbel
beer
is
good
happy
beering
this
dubbel
is
very
enjoyable
but
after
having
the
tripel
i
expected
a
bit
more
depth
and
some
bold
flavors
a
tad
understated
but
still
a
nice
quaff
drinkability
not
cheap
and
relatively
hard
to
find
in
this
area
but
it
has
good
drinkability
and
if
it
werent
so
damn
pricey
id
drink
this
a
lot
more
often
great
belgian
offering
i
probably
wont
buy
any
westmalle
again
even
though
i
quite
enjoyed
this
and
the
tripel
i
simply
feel
that
there
are
much
better
products
on
the
market
for
the
money
whether
they
are
authentic
trappist
products
or
not
this
should
not
discourage
you
from
trying
it
anyway
though
if
you
are
seeking
out
information
on
the
trappist
ales
you
are
likely
going
to
try
seek
them
all
out
regardless
happy
hunting
to
you
hightly
enjoyable
simply
fantastic
complex
flavors
keep
your
mouth
interested
no
way
to
put
this
down
thinking
youve
got
it
completely
figured
out
this
is
a
beer
i
cant
even
break
down
into
categories
what
makes
this
beer
so
special
to
me
is
that
everything
works
together
so
brilliantly
the
deep
brown
color
capped
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
taste
and
smell
of
apples
and
bananas
its
all
here
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
and
i
think
its
one
of
the
best
trappist
beers
available
highly
highly
drinkable
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
apparent
alcohol
negatively
affects
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
overall
a
decent
but
underwhelming
brew
the
pour
is
a
rusty
brown
tea
color
with
some
haze
from
the
yeast
the
rich
and
ample
head
lives
well
within
the
glass
sturdy
lace
adds
to
the
perceived
elegance
the
nose
is
vinous
and
caramel
with
a
touch
of
sweet
tea
and
slight
alcohol
this
product
bowls
me
over
in
the
taste
department
i¬ím
literally
¬ëdubbeled
over¬í
with
its
quality
its
fruity
prune
and
grapes
a
bit
spicy
with
some
earthen
tones
and
a
solid
body
that
ends
clean
dry
and
crisp
with
slight
alcohol
and
malts
this
is
smoother
than
barry
white
doesnt
really
have
enough
to
keep
me
interested
and
this
harshness
in
the
finish
is
discouraging
poured
into
my
chimay
chalice
with
a
thick
slightly
tan
head
that
subsided
slowly
atop
a
deep
hazy
brownish
red
brew
the
aroma
was
aparant
immediatly
upon
pouring
as
the
fruity
esters
and
dark
fruits
seemed
to
jump
from
the
glass
upon
closer
inspection
a
slight
malt
could
be
detected
along
with
an
alcoholic
touch
the
taste
was
very
balanced
and
complex
with
an
initial
rush
of
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
flavors
which
quickly
segued
into
an
effervescent
rush
of
carbonation
which
seeme
do
have
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
it
as
well
finishing
dry
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
as
this
ale
had
a
delicate
creamy
texture
to
it
and
the
effervescent
carbonation
created
a
very
delicat
balance
an
excellent
trappist
ale
i
would
definely
include
this
ale
if
i
were
hosting
a
belgian
beer
tasting
as
it
is
approachable
and
also
indicitive
of
belgian
brewing
abv
is
moderate
but
i
was
really
felling
it
even
after
the
first
few
sips
very
warming
very
smooth
extremely
enjoyable
a
very
good
and
drinkable
beer
not
my
favorite
has
a
very
dry
spicy
flavor
alchol
is
big
and
present
not
enough
extra
stuff
going
on
to
mask
the
alcohol
looks
nice
in
the
glass
nice
head
and
all
but
thats
about
it
as
far
as
postives
go
maybe
i
just
dont
like
belgian
beers
i
did
not
really
care
for
this
one
oh
sure
it
looked
decent
when
first
poured
into
the
westmalle
goblet
nice
warm
brown
creamy
offwhite
head
but
it
left
no
lace
in
a
beer
clean
glass
smell
was
yeasty
with
hints
of
alcohol
and
some
fruit
taste
was
a
disappointment
may
have
turned
on
me
not
sure
it
was
not
sweet
like
i
expect
a
dubbel
to
be
and
was
not
syrupy
in
the
way
of
mouth
feel
too
dry
and
yeastydoughy
with
some
hints
of
coffeecocoa
in
the
finish
i
enjoyed
this
one
on
a
sunday
afternoon
from
a
large
tulip
glass
the
color
is
a
deep
mysterious
chestnut
brown
topped
with
an
astounding
off
white
head
there¬ís
not
so
much
lacing
as
a
thick
growth
of
foam
trailing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
appearance
of
this
brew
is
exceptional
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
sugars
toasted
malts
yeast
and
spice
taste
is
grain
ripe
fruit
sugar
and
malt
esters
and
spice
and
sweetness¬Öat
times
it
seemed
almost
colalike
a
characteristic
that
i
didn¬ít
really
enjoy
full
mouthfeel
with
a
creamy
texture
and
only
moderate
carbonation
it¬ís
a
fine
brew
but
somehow
not
up
to
expectations
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
never
disappoints
this
is
a
great
beer
you
really
dont
have
to
read
any
more
than
that
go
get
yourself
one
it
has
a
dark
opaque
orangebrown
color
and
a
mamouth
creamy
head
the
aroma
was
quite
nice
sweet
malty
goodness
i
smelled
some
apple
and
citrus
too
the
taste
is
in
a
word
sweet
some
noticable
hops
but
the
overiding
taste
and
the
one
that
lingers
is
one
of
sweetness
great
beer
the
smell
is
nice
containing
candy
sugars
and
hints
of
alcohol
its
only
weakness
is
that
its
a
little
too
weak
the
taste
is
quite
good
flavors
bring
malt
behind
more
candy
sugar
alcohol
is
barely
detectable
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
while
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
overall
its
very
good
and
worth
a
try
not
a
bad
drink
still
quality
but
not
something
ill
be
searching
for
again
this
was
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
large
persistent
light
tan
head
there
was
a
lot
of
dark
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
has
a
great
spicy
yeasty
smell
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
spicy
good
but
i
was
expecting
better
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
drinkability
is
not
great
pours
a
cloudy
impenetrable
ruby
under
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
but
does
fade
to
thick
film
leaving
a
bit
of
lace
fairly
distinct
caramel
and
plum
nose
quite
pleasant
very
prickly
and
fairly
light
in
the
mouth
nice
subtle
brew
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
from
both
the
fruit
and
the
malt
a
bit
like
carbonated
grape
juice
but
with
enough
malt
to
give
it
some
backbone
there
are
hops
here
too
even
deeper
in
the
background
lending
just
an
echo
to
the
taste
as
the
liquid
goes
down
the
aftertaste
is
ever
so
slightly
bitter
with
a
more
ample
dose
of
fruity
sweetness
very
pleasant
perhaps
even
classy
product
this
is
a
really
good
and
musty
beer
very
fruity
and
delicious
worth
every
penny
hehe
first
sip
reveals
average
body
and
fine
yet
prickly
carbonation
flavor
is
complex
and
starts
fruity
sweet
with
berry
and
cherry
flavors
mixing
with
biscuity
yeast
almost
like
a
scone
some
tart
astringent
flavors
as
well
which
make
me
pucker
just
a
bit
i
get
peppery
spicincess
and
a
drying
finish
allowing
a
white
grape
flavor
to
come
through
a
very
interesting
brew
that
is
not
overwhelming
could
be
a
good
crossover
brew
the
drinkability
is
good
for
this
type
of
beverage
drinkability
pretty
good
but
despite
its
relatively
low
alcohol
content
i
want
to
drink
this
slowly
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
just
too
strong
in
flavor
for
that
but
i
will
definitely
try
this
again

has
a

on

the
label
is
different
than
that
pictured
not
the
most
complex
of
the
trappist
dubbels
more
alcoholic
than
most
yet
still
maintaining
a
nice
complexity
of
flavors
a
nice
dubbel
but
not
the
best
drinkability
wellstructured
beer
complex
and
satisfying
would
be
better
with
a
more
complete
finish
overall
a
darn
good
dubbel
here
im
definitely
going
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
near
future
although
the
price
while
not
too
high
isnt
exactly
cheap
either
deep
dark
red
brown
beer
with
a
nice
full
white
head
full
horsey
barnyard
yeast
aromas
dominate
with
some
sweet
malty
notes
in
the
back
good
rich
mouthfeel
with
excellent
carbonation
the
tastes
are
at
different
times
citrusy
breadlike
and
spicey
with
apricot
and
grape
flavors
finishes
clean
and
dry
well
balanced
a
beer
i
will
enjoy
again
a
deep
garnet
ruby
colored
body
with
a
big
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
dried
fruit
with
some
fig
and
a
light
underpining
of
spiceyness
there
is
a
distinct
chocolate
characteristic
at
the
start
of
the
taste
followed
by
a
fizzy
burst
of
carbonation
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
then
there
is
the
light
fig
sweetness
on
the
finish
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
maltychewy
and
syrupy
but
with
a
dry
finish
only
the
good
expensive
beers
are
able
to
do
this
this
is
another
of
the
good
ones
oooh
i
should
buy
more
than
one
next
time
dark
muddy
red
color
and
tall
beige
colored
head
made
this
an
attractive
looking
beer
the
aroma
was
spicy
and
malty
with
notes
of
cocoa
cinnamon
and
plums
the
taste
was
sweet
and
fruity
with
cherries
apples
and
pears
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
hollow
and
was
clearly
the
weakest
point
of
this
beer
very
light
and
drinkable
for
a
7
abv
ale
but
not
the
best
dubbel
i¬íve
had
dark
brown
in
hue
with
a
tawnyruby
influence
i
could
see
a
few
chunks
of
yeast
floating
in
the
liquid
oops
still
i¬íd
say
the
beer
is
largely
clear
the
head
is
offwhite
in
color
almost
beige
at
the
apex
the
head
reached
one
finger
in
height
and
it
quickly
faded
to
a
half
finger
cap
this
remained
for
the
entire
consumption
impressive
subsequent
lacing
was
splotchy
and
it
clung
poorly
still
this
is
a
goodlooking
beer
largely
because
the
head
held
like
cement
the
nose
is
very
enjoyable
the
potency
isn¬ít
as
loud
as
i¬íd
like
but
i¬ím
picky
the
aromas
included
a
fantastic
malty
base
rich
and
chocolately
like
a
cookie
nutty
toffee
if
this
was
all
the
bouquet
offered
i¬íd
be
happy
but
i¬ím
elated
because
there
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
fruity
aromas
including
cherries
dates
raisins
grapes
yes
there
is
a
difference
between
raisins
and
grapes
apples
infused
with
figs
coriander
and
brandy
nice
as
a
whole
the
nose
is
a
malty
harvest
the
palate
doesn¬ít
live
up
the
nose
it¬ís
not
close
really
the
bouquet
told
me
¬ìbig
malty
backbone¬Ö
rich
flavorful
¬î
it
was
not
i
found
the
malt
to
be
thin
and
not
that
flavorful
sure
it
is
good
but
not
that
yummy
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
naked
as
well
this
hurts
the
fruity
qualities
which
is
a
shame
i
can
find
some
nuttiness
bitter
chocolate
that
is
not
very
rich
there
is
some
astringency
that
is
vague
and
aimless
it
can¬ít
find
a
partner
to
dance
with
clovey
fruitiness
is
a
mix
of
bananas
with
a
very
weak
kiss
of
grapes
and
apples
on
the
whole
the
palate
is
good
but
nothing
more
it
lacks
pizzazz
for
one
thing
but
the
weakness
of
the
malt
is
really
disappointing
for
a
dubbel
it
is
average
decent
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
again
more
malt
please
mediumlight
in
body
with
zesty
carbonation
the
bubbles
feel
small
but
active
this
aspect
of
this
beer
is
satisfactory
i
don¬ít
really
care
for
the
tacky
aftertaste
sure
this
beer
is
drinkable
i
found
it
quite
pleasant
and
enjoyable
i
have
to
mention
a
bottle
in
omaha
runs
5
00
with
that
in
mind
it
is
not
that
drinkable
i
can
buy
a
sixpack
of
new
belgium¬ís
much
tastier
dubbel
for
6
50
it
is
a
nobrainer
as
to
what
beer
i¬íd
select
in
the
future
bottom
line
it
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
and
nothing
i
think
i
will
seek
out
again
unless
it
is
much
cheaper
at
john¬ís
in
iowa
city
pours
a
dark
mahogany
the
head
is
nice
and
lacy
sticks
around
a
good
long
while
smell
is
exquisite
scents
of
currant
anise
and
chocolate
truly
a
decadent
whiff
taste
is
awesome
both
full
and
spicy
creamy
mouthfeel
an
overall
excellent
beer
taking
a
better
look
in
the
beercellar
i
saw
that
there
were
still
6
bottles
left
of
westmalle
dubbel
that
went
over
the
best
before
date
off
course
i
decided
to
open
up
1
and
find
out
how
they
were
aging
opening
it
carefully
i
found
out
that
it
had
a
little
gushing
but
with
the
glass
nearby
no
problem
for
the
rest
the
beer
best
before
21504
was
still
in
a
perfect
condition
great
hoppy
smell
and
a
great
taste
of
candice
sugar
fermentation
malts
and
hop
altogether
it
came
very
hamonic
i
realy
enjoyed
drinking
it
and
i
wondered
how
it
could
be
that
i
didnt
drink
one
earlier
cause
its
just
a
great
beer
probably
its
because
i
love
their
triple
so
much
that
i
forgot
how
good
the
double
is
and
am
sure
the
rest
of
my
stock
westmalle
double
wont
last
that
long
strong
carbonation
and
flavour
residual
spice
great
lacing
in
chestnut
brown
sweet
and
spicy
cocoa
berries
that
seem
and
smell
like
wine

only
a
small

three
years

it
was

good

a

slight
suggestions
of
husk
spice
and
sundried
dark
fruit
head
retention

even
in

initial

finishing
clean

further
tastes
include
notes
of
sweat
yeast
plum
skins
and
a
metallic
twang
that
comes
from
an
active
carbonation
and
coincides
well
with
the
evident
huskiness
faint
woody
esters
come
into
play
very
nice
and
pleasurable
to
drink
taste
is
also
fruity
but
also
metallic
caramael
and
nutty
some
molasses
and
barnyard
funk
but
the
flavors
are
tame
and
the
mouth
is
thin
watery
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
a
light
metallic
and
sticky
aftertaste
its
not
even
that
tasty
very
disappointed
in
this
one
enjoyed
the
tripel
really
did
not
care
for
the
dubbel
at
all
not
bad
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
monster
fluffy
sandy
coloured
head
that
stayed
for
a
long
time
plenty
of
thick
sticky
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
wasnt
very
impressive
it
wasnt
terrible
it
just
didnt
seem
to
me
to
have
a
smell
worthy
of
a
4
rating
a
little
hoppy
little
raisin
like
thats
it
perhaps
its
just
this
particular
bottle
the
taste
however
was
very
good
indeed
a
little
bit
of
cooked
apples
a
little
bit
of
raisins
plenty
of
yeast
hey
its
belgian
very
smooth
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
over
all
pretty
damn
tasty
oh
yeah
and
my
bottle
says
7
0abv
not
6
5
slight
change
in
recipe
perhaps
new
discovery
made
at
the
brewery
just
a
mistake
hmm
interesting
but
not
impressive
i
love
their
triple
even
though
i
dont
really
care
for
triples
now
i
am
not
impressed
by
their
dubbel
although
i
love
dubbels
i
am
left
thinking
that
either
this
bottle
has
had
a
rough
life
or
other
people
will
worship
any
monk
droppings
i
will
try
this
again
at
a
later
date
and
hope
for
better
things
pours
a
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
massive
invincible
head
that
lasts
to
the
bitter
end
and
gobs
and
gobs
of
lace
theres
apples
cinammon
raisins
dark
chocolate
and
passionfruit
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
remarkably
complex
like
the
smell
its
replete
with
the
fruits
detected
on
the
nose
as
well
as
berries
and
an
alcohol
twang
its
extremely
refreshing
my
only
fault
with
the
taste
is
that
the
alcohol
is
a
little
strong
tasting
for
its
low
abv
many
belgian
brews
with
much
higher
abvs
conceal
them
better
than
this
thats
a
very
minor
imperfection
and
this
beer
is
still
excellent
very
refreshing
though
as
far
as
dubbels
go
maudite
is
still
the
best
berries
when
poured
it
was
a
medium
dark
brown
with
loads
of
off
white
foam
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
the
flavor
was
of
toasty
toffeecaramel
with
soft
malts
and
hops
well
balanced
and
very
pleasant
to
the
palate
in
the
end
this
dubbel
was
darkm
fullbodied
with
hints
of
toffee
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
with
a
rich
redbrown
color
crowned
with
thin
tan
lace
that
leaves
sticky
swirls
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
it
has
a
full
nose
of
sweet
malted
barley
and
of
carmel
the
taste
is
divine
sweet
carmel
and
molasses
intertwine
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
nutmeg
raisin
cherry
prune
and
sweet
bread
pudding
this
is
decadent
and
satisfying
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
because
it
is
not
as
heavy
as
youd
expect
for
all
these
rich
flavors
this
makes
it
easily
drinkable
and
a
wonderful
example
of
a
belgain
dubbel
meh
not
crazy
about
this
i
have
waited
too
long
to
try
this
beer
pours
out
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
huge
beautiful
off
white
head
the
smell
is
amazing
soft
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
fruityness
wow
the
taste
is
not
what
i
expected
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
had
raisins
figs
earthyness
and
some
citrus
coming
through
carbonation
is
sharp
in
the
beginning
then
gives
way
to
a
big
warming
feeling
at
the
end
so
smooth
and
so
balanced
i
am
guessing
the
alcohol
notes
would
mellow
out
with
a
bit
of
aging
even
after
some
time
the
head
stays
creamy
smooth
and
fully
entacted
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
i
cant
wait
to
try
more

post
dessert
would
go
great
with
a
nice
rich
cigar
sitting
on
the
deck
with
old
friends
a
tasty
treat
not
as
good
as
the
triple
but
holds
its
own
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
an
awesome
pale
and
belgian
crystal
malt
scent
with
a
tart
yet
fruity
belgian
yeast
finish
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
creamy
brown
ale
flavor
with
a
tart
fruity
belgian
yeast
finish
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
creamy
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
it
has
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
a
fine
sessions
brew
this
was
the
first
trappist
beer
i
ever
tried
when
i
was
in
belgium
last
year
and
so
it
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart
l
but
i
waited
a
year
and
tried
some
other
dubbels
and
belgian
brown
ales
before
i
reviewed
this
puppy
presentation
11
2
oz
bottle
pours
a
medium
brown
somewhat
clear
but
thats
because
i
kept
the
inch
that
much
of
yeast
sediment
from
pouring
into
the
glass
head
was
a
surprising
mix
of
large
and
small
bubbles
offwhitetan
that
looked
more
like
a
soda
pop
head
than
a
beer
head
aroma
is
the
best
feature
of
this
beer
bready
with
a
light
sweetness
malty
pleasant
gentle
chocolate
aroma
follows
through
into
flavor
here
some
pepper
also
comes
through
however
the
alcohol
isnt
hidden
as
much
as
i
would
like
thus
negatively
affecting
the
balance
in
my
humble
opinion
still
very
good
and
i
will
gladly
drink
more
but
would
like
it
toned
down
a
bit
as
it
warmed
it
seemed
there
was
almost
some
smokiness
coming
through
i
dont
think
this
is
quite
right
but
i
cant
find
a
better
descriptor
maybe
a
bit
of
aging
helps
mellow
and
balance
it

bit

poured
a
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
dense
head
and
looking
very
inviting
aroma
is
both
fruity
and
spicy
with
a
peppery
note
flavor
is
slightly
vinous
malty
and
notes
of
burnt
sugar
the
body
is
quite
effervescent
and
with
a
lively
carbonation
i
was
surprised
at
the
vinous
characteristics
this
dubbel
had
overall
a
complex
one
for
sure
maybe
the
most
complex
i¬íve
had
thus
far
pours
a
very
sexy
brown
with
a
big
tan
full
head
very
smooth
with
a
wonderfully
well
crafted
sweet
malt
flow
over
perfect
balance
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
with
a
full
flavor
profile
all
should
try
this
brew
it
is
a
shame
that
these
beers
are
oh
so
very
hard
to
find
in
the
states
smooth
and
candy
sweet
with
a
scotch
like
flavor
due
to
the
alcohol
very
well
balanced
one
of
the
best
doubles
ive
had
uniqueness
is
redefined
a
beer
that
begins
its
existence
in
the
shadow
of
its
world
reknowned
big
brother
has
its
standards
set
high
before
the
bottle
is
even
opened
eager
this
one
is
to
prove
its
worthiness
as
i
crack
the
top
of
the
signature
westmalle
bottle
a
volcano
erupts
reaching
for
the
heavens
catching
me
off
guard
and
making
for
a
sloppy
beginning
to
the
pour
let
it
be
said
now
that
this
if
any
was
the
only
flaw
i
could
find
with
this
beer
the
final
pour
resulted
in
a
deep
earthy
reddishbrown
body
with
a
lively
light
beige
head
that
calms
quickly
as
if
to
show
reassurance
in
my
snifter
being
its
final
resting
place
the
smell
dominately
sweet
but
beyond
that
nearly
indescribable
imagine
smelling
every
fruit
in
existence
exclusively
and
all
together
at
the
same
timefruitopia
of
the
gods
the
taste
reflects
the
nose
with
a
symphony
of
sweetness
which
is
obviously
the
masterful
combination
of
malts
with
the
trademark
belgian
touch
of
sugar
and
spices
the
sweetness
is
not
out
of
control
and
there
is
a
hint
of
yeast
and
a
slight
bitterness
and
crispness
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
and
very
smooth
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
with
or
without
food
in
a
pub
or
at
home
and
with
a
fox
or
in
a
box

in

its

that

tells

tale
i
found
this
nice
but
dull
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
was
not
exciting
as
i
expected
or
the
price
suggested
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
as
a
winter

its
versatile
enough
to
be
consumed
virtually
anytime
of
the
year
what
a
suprise
to
find
a
case
of
this
sitting
in
my
local
beer
store
today
i
love
the
tripel
in
my
top
5
so
i
grabbed
one
of
these
up
to
try
in
the
middle
of
a
750
of
val
dieu
brown
an
excellent
brew
in
its
own
right
i
drank
this
it
is
fantastic
tastes
as
much
like
a
dark
belgian
as
a
dubbel
better
than
the
val
dieu
and
better
than
chimay
red
or
maudite
imo
nice
dark
fruity
taste
wonderful
balance
and
taste
a
little
expensive
at
4
99
a
bottle
but
ill
be
buying
1
or
2
of
these
each
time
i
go
to
that
store
and
i
asked
him
to
get
the
tripel
also
no
advocates
the
numbers
dont
lie
i
friggin
liked
a
belgian
this
beer
was
a
dark
amber
brown
with
a
big
thick
head
chunks
of
lace
clung
here
and
there
to
the
glass
aroma
was
strong
and
yeasty
but
lacked
the
spicy
clovy
notes
that
have
turned
me
off
to
other
beers
from
this
country
taste
was
very
smooth
had
a
yeasty
bite
but
was
not
riddled
with
cloves
bananas
and
spices
i
detected
a
solid
malt
base
with
a
yeast
presence
some
slight
raisiny
fruitiness
was
good
at
7
it
has
a
bite
but
not
overpowering
i
found
this
very
drinkable
enjoyed
this
as
an
after
dinner
drink
and
is
a
belgian
ale
i
will
be
sure
to
have
again
finally
though
not
quite
as
good
as
the
tripel
this
is
still
a
damn
good
beer
nonetheless
a
nice
plum
sweetness
makes
this
a
beer
that
ill
certainly
be
having
in
the
future
co2
bubbles
stream
to
the
surface
of
this
crimson
colored
brew
at
a
very
rapid
pace
the
body
of
this
beer
is
topped
of
with
a
gigantic
mousselike
light
brown
head
the
retention
is
excellent
there
are
nice
aromas
of
chocolate
yeast
must
chalk
and
candy
the
flavors
are
a
little
bready
chalky
and
dry
alcohol
presence
is
really
kept
in
check
some
bubblegum
makes
an
appearance
as
well
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
the
body
is
lightmedium
this
is
enjoyable
a
fine
dubble
one
of
my
favorites
actually
will
have
again
the
aromas
are
of
concentrated
very
ripe
fig
plum
and
wild
berries
joined
by
nutmeg
toffee
and
malt
the
flavors
are
bold
and
stately
with
a
glycerinpacked
texture
that
reveals
hints
of
seasoned
wood
brandy
grape
skins
and
currants
balanced
to
perfection
between
boozy
brandied
fruits
and
finely
milled
papery
tannins
loads
of
fruit
here
along
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
quite
tasty
soft
medium
bodied
intense
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
the
not
so
much
in
your
face
flavors
lead
to
outstanding
drinkability
dark
sludgy
brown
with
rusty
tawny
reddish
edges
great
cap
of
fluffy
firm
tan
foam
ever
so
tall
and
present
creepingly
settling
to
an
ever
present
murky
skim
and
finely
stitched
lace
sticks
aroma
is
intially
soft
and
ripe
of
fruits
giving
a
blend
of
mango
grapes
passion
and
pear
skins
a
nice
earthy
dusting
of
dry
yeast
and
bread
crusts
settles
across
the
top
after
a
bit
with
ever
so
present
gleams
of
candied
sugars
taste
is
plump
and
a
bit
overcarbonated
which
gets
in
the
way
for
me
with
every
sip
as
soon
as
i
begin
to
get
something
out
of
it
taste
wise
the
carbonation
wipes
it
away
far
to
quickly
a
bit
too
sharp
for
my
tastes
perhaps
an
aged
bottle
of
a
year
or
more
would
help
as
this
was
bottled
2004
what
is
there
for
tastes
are
some
dullish
fruity
malts
in
a
darker
realm
of
plum
raisin
and
dry
figs
mixing
a
bit
inbetween
some
pear
and
cherry
pieces
slight
cocoa
and
a
firm
earthy
yeasty
dryness
with
just
a
pinch
of
spice
and
walnut
skin
dryness
finish
it
out
very
nice
finish
body
is
full
with
a
bit
much
on
the
carbonation
scale
which
has
a
scratchychalkylike
coat
on
the
way
down
which
sorta
blends
into
the
complex
drying
qualities
in
the
finish
after
awhile
which
i
actually
liked
so
that
made
up
for
some
of
my
dissatisfaction
in
the
carbonation
dept
overall
this
is
one
to
come
back
too
with
age
i
think
this
might
round
or
smooth
out
and
be
one
fun
and
fine
ale
to
behold
pours
a
darker
shade
of
brown
with
a
nice
fluffysticky
head
you
can
tell
this
well
made
by
the
pour
alone
anyways
i
get
a
deep
brown
sugar
aroma
a
red
wine
hint
almost
like
a
port
wine
taste
of
spiced
cake
and
raisinsvery
rich
tasting
a
little
harsh
in
the
mouth
though
wasnt
as
smooth
and
creamy
as
expected
aroma
and
flavor
wise
a
real
top
notch
brew
but
in
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
it
lacks
in
my
opinion
pours
a
huge
light
brown
five
fingerhead
leaving
just
traces
of
lace
pour
slowly
deep
ruby
color
good
carbonation
medium
bodied
starts
malty
and
sweet
finishes
with
a
good
mix
of
hops
and
malt
but
a
slightly
hoppy
aftertaste
my
100th
belgian
and
not
a
bad
one
in
the
bunch
the
abv
is
7
0
5
39
for
a
330ml
bottle
this
is
one
of
my
first
belgian
brews
excuse
my
lack
of
experience
in
this
area
i
drank
this
beer
within
the
posted
freshness
date
and
noted
no
telltale
signs
of
spoilage
i
can
only
conclude
that
on
the
whole
this
is
a
rather
hohum
brew
from
the
good
brothers
at
westmalle
whose
reputation
for
excellence
is
not
upheld
by
this
rather
uninspired
twicefermented
ale
these
belgian
ales
are
all
so
different
the
dubbel
and
trippel
classifications
dont
even
tell
you
that
much
just
be
ready
to
sit
and
sip
and
enjoy
this
one
is
definitely
a
winner
really
a
superb
dubbel
this
is
simply
the
blue
print
by
which
all
other
dubbels
are
based
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
the
packaging
may
have
set
me
up
to
expect
too
much
raised
embossed
bottle
with
paper
label
overlay
probably
to
meet
export
label
standards
the
hallmarks
of
a
quality
imported
belgian
ale
i
suppose
ive
come
to
expect
all
belgian
trappists
to
be
really
good
beers
so
this
was
a
letdown
when
it
came
in
at
a
bit
above
average
the
flavor
was
rather
blunt
and
simple
not
much
in
the
way
of
spicyness
or
depth
of
the
malt
and
yeast
interplay
some
rough
dark
orchard
fruit
and
a
bit
of
caramel
to
the
malt
sharply
fizzy
with
good
head
retention
bottle
¬ñ
poured
a
redbrown
quite
opaque
brew
with
a
huge
head
with
standard
retention
great
carbonation
with
strong
body
aroma
is
very
spicy
with
no
alcohol
noticeable
taste
is
great
with
the
usual
belgian
style
mix
of
malts
and
hops
with
some
added
roastiness
to
that
one
the
spice
mix
is
a
bit
stronger
then
expected
but
overall
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
something
greater
from
this
well
known
trappist
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
yeasty
with
fruits
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
quite
sweet
and
filled
with
caramel
tones
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
its
a
great
beer
but
it
cant
hold
ground
against
others
in
the
same
category
we
finally
can
get
this
again
in
the
us
the
last
time
i
had
this
was
on
tap
in
london
anyway
this
one
is
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
dense
tan
head
smell
is
dense
and
of
bready
malts
and
fruity
esters
mixed
with
some
yeast
and
sugar
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
with
touches
of
vanilla
chocolate
and
great
belgian
yeasts
amazing
one
of
my
favorite
beers
goes
great
with
moules
and
frites
the
flavor
here
is
a
simple
smooth
blend
of
basic
tasty
elements
the
malt
goes
through
a
progression
of
flavor
phases
and
they
end
up
leaving
a
very
good
impression
overall
at
the
same
time
and
in
a
smaller
way
the
simplicity
doesnt
do
a
lot
to
make
it
stand
out
drinking
it
is
easy
enough
and
certainly
not
disappointing
yet
im
just
okay
with
the
idea
of
having
another
not
all
moony
faced
and
gaga
in
a
nutshell
im
not
floored
but
theres
nothing
that
puts
a
true
black
mark
on
its
permanent
record
so
lets
face
it
its
not
bad
at
all
westmalle¬ís
dubbel
is
a
nice
brew
that¬ís
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
the
rather
heavy
sweetness
wouldn¬ít
have
me
drinking
much
more
than
one
before
i¬íd
feel
kinda
full
all
in
all
a
good
beer
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
the
caramel
and
bread
tones
last
long
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
the
alcohol
not
noticebale
at
all
this
is
an
exceptional
drinking
dubbel
ontap
at
lucky
baldwins
belgian
festival
its
a
somewhat
murky
brown
with
traces
of
red
ripe
fruit
is
present
in
the
smell
and
taste
althought
its
a
very
nice
beer
my
expectations
were
a
bit
elevated
and
the
taste
didnt
quite
come
through
like
expected
everything
works
nicely
together
but
its
not
a
worldbeater
a
bit
blander
than
i
recall
lack
or
flavour
and
aroma
too
fizzy
and
not
as
smooth
a
rage
of
activity
here
intense
carbonation
produces
a
volcanic
like
oooze
of
foam
as
it
rests
in
glass
awaiting
tasting
the
head
is
stiff
and
aliveit
has
taken
on
a
soft
serve
ice
cream
appearance
and
it
seems
i
will
have
to
lick
my
way
to
the
beer
aromatics
are
difficult
to
peg
through
the
mountain
of
thick
foam
some
warm
malty
banana
raisinet
creamy
dark
chocolate
blue
cheesequite
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
dry
rather
complex
full
bodied
and
quite
creamy
malty
flavors
and
fruity
dark
chocolate
flavors
dominate
much
like
eating
a
very
fine
dark
chocolate
with
a
raspberry
filling
bitter
chocolate
dusty
malt
notes
and
a
very
fine
champagne
like
bubble
make
for
a
charming
and
memorable
finish
ill
try
this
one
again
fer
sure
poured
very
carefully
into
a
goblet
still
produces
a
large
billowy
beige
head
on
top
of
a
mahogany
body
nice
belgian
aroma
of
vanilla
prunes
bananas
coriander
and
allspice
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
silky
taste
begins
with
a
spicy
earthiness
plenty
of
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
figs
are
in
a
constant
battle
with
the
yeasty
woodiness
and
spice
array
sheets
of
belgian
lace
are
all
over
the
goblet
alcohol
is
concealed
very
well
seems
overly
carbonated
for
a
belgian
dubbel
or
maybe
its
my
imagination
very
nicely
balanced
otherwise
and
another
fine
smooth
satiny
belgian
dubbel
ale
that
is
ideal
on
a
cold
winter
evening
highly
carbonated
providing
a
huge
head
and
releasing
a
very
nice
caramel
aroma
with
underlying
dark
fruits
the
flavor
is
very
complex
begining
with
chocolate
before
a
spicy
middle
and
followed
by
a
cherry
finish
very
interesting
with
many
more
flavors
than
i
can
hope
to
name
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
world
class
this
beer
exploded
with
a
frothy
head
i
should
have
poured
more
carefully
i
am
new
to
this
style
of
beer
but
i
am
very
impressed
as
i
should
be
for
5
dollars
a
single
appearance
is
deep
ruby
with
a
yeasty
haze
and
a
thick
overwhelming
head
very
bubbly
smells
fruity
and
intense
taste
is
mostly
of
tart
cherry
grape
and
raisin
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
alcohol
warmth
complex
and
bursting
with
great
flavor
mouthfeel
could
be
silkier
but
altogether
everything
wet
together
to
make
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
am
hiding
one
in
the
basement
to
try
in
a
few
years
cheers
to
monks
at
westmalle
for
creating
this
masterpiece
sampled
at
from
the
vine
beer
tasting
jan
9th
2004
this
brew
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
foamy
light
beige
head
very
thin
lacing
it
has
an
aroma
of
fruit
malt
and
toffee
mediumbodied
and
rather
smooth
with
lively
carbonation
the
flavor
consists
of
fruit
plum
was
very
noticeable
malt
and
nuts
the
flavors
did
not
seem
to
play
very
well
together
though
the
finish
has
a
nice
dark
fruit
character
to
it
though
this
beer
is
decent
but
i
have
had
better
dubbels
flavors
of
caramel
light
chocolate
fruity
esters
and
yeast
sprites
plenty
of
nice
coarse
complexity
smooth
full
body
and
crisp
edges
at
the
finish
wonderfully
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
beer
poured
a
dark
red
color
and
formed
an
off
white
thick
foamy
head
that
left
circular
lace
when
it
finally
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
and
some
sediment
present
an
aroma
of
malt
and
fruit
with
a
trace
of
breadyeast
a
flavor
of
malt
and
some
fruit
but
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
overpowers
it
the
finish
is
light
for
the
style
and
sprite
not
as
good
as
the
tripel
they
make
truly
amazing
beer
really
sets
the
standards
for
dubbels
to
follow
nevertheless
a
nice
brew
worth
buying
im
really
starting
to
dig
the
abbey
dubbel
style
more
and
more
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
ruby
colour
with
an
offwhite
moderate
sized
head
that
lasts
but
settles
in
quite
quickly
to
a
thinner
head
smells
of
alcohol
caramel
grapes
cherries
all
with
a
hint
of
maltiness
the
malt
is
more
dominant
in
the
taste
along
with
the
caramel
but
the
other
smells
are
present
in
taste
here
as
well
and
present
a
nice
balance
which
ends
with
a
slightly
dry
hop
finish
this
is
quite
a
smooth
brew
that
is
creamy
but
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
from
the
carbonation
at
the
end
quite
enjoyable

this
beer
was
quite
dry
and
at
first
not
nearly
as
complex
as
i
was
expecting
the
color
was
solidly
amber
without
much
in
the
way
of
haze
as
it
warmed
up
a
bit
it
began
to
open
up
and
show
what
it
had
to
offer
it
picked
up
a
hint
of
sweetness
which
helped
to
boost
the
malt
perception
there
was
a
bit
of
raisin
the
mouth
as
well
as
a
finish
that
was
sweet
from
the
alcohol
the
aroma
too
had
an
alcohol
component
to
it
as
well
as
a
bit
of
woodiness
quite
estery
tasting
without
being
particularly
fruity
tasting
there
seemed
to
be
some
higher
alcohols
in
here
as
well
wow
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
gigantic
frothy
tan
head
i
used
a
brandy
snifter
since
i
dont
have
a
chalice
caramel
fruity
aroma
the
one
thing
that
struck
me
about
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
that
its
extremely
comforting
for
some
reason
figgy
fruity
taste
with
understated
chocolate
tones
the
mouthfeel
is
out
of
this
world
its
just
so
smooth
while
this
isnt
one
to
pound
down
night
after
night
this
beer
is
just
so
drinkable
im
seriously
in
heaven
drinking
this
beer
spectacular
i
managed
to
resist
temptation
somewhat
successfully
and
age
this
bottle
for
about
one
year
before
succumbing
right
from
the
crack
of
the
cap
the
beer
gives
off
a
pleasant
sweet
prunelike
aroma
undergirded
by
a
distinctively
belgian
yeasty
maltiness
this
dubbel
is
quite
an
attractive
beer
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
the
flavor
starts
off
quite
sweet
characterized
largely
by
a
deep
figgy
fruitiness
combined
with
the
bready
body
this
gives
me
the
not
unpleasant
impression
of
fig
newtons
toward
the
end
light
chocolatey
and
toasty
notes
are
noticeable
in
the
background
and
the
beer
finishes
with
a
mild
alcohol
spiciness
quite
full
and
body
and
luxuriously
creamy
in
mouthfeel
very
very
yummy
i
stand
by
my
ratings
from
the
initial
taste
and
didn¬ít
actually
change
the
score
of
this
beer
but
i
will
say
after
trying
over
200
belgian
ales
since
the
first
review
it
really
is
one
of
the
best
offerings
of
the
style
on
the
market
small

cool

and
an

with
a
fluffy
bubbly
biege
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
covering
very
quickly
lots
of
candied
fruits
on
the
smell
carmelized
like

bottom

bananas
foster
super
smooth

very
good
flavor
soaked
yeasty
belgian
goodness
hints
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
just
ever
so
dry
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
real
treat
this
one
came

of

originally
sampled
on
8
march
2003
at
pizza
ports
belgian
beer
fest
i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
this
is
a
dark
brown
beer
with
a
lot
of
fizz
in
the
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocked
fruit
with
notes
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
trappist
pours
a
rubybrown
color
with
a
huge
beige
head
excellent
head
retention
leads
to
excellent
lacing
down
the
glass
nose
includes
hints
of
sweet
malt
spices
and
chocolate
notes
of
the
sweet
malt
very
subdued
hops
yeast
and
raisins
introduce
themselves
to
the
palate
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
dubbel
perhaps
the
best
ive
tried
so
far
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
but
hard
to
pinpoint
definitely
worth
seeking
out
nice
distinct
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
and
a
nice
tan
head
the
head
goes
away
not
much
lace
some
vanilla
and
malt
in
the
nose
good
carbonation
malt
chocolate
hint
of
fruit
more
hops
than
a
lot
of
belgians
the
finish
is
different
and
overall
the
beer
comes
off
as
a
little
watery
musky
hoppy
this
is
very
good
beer
the
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
with
dried
cherry
and
chocolate
and
some
leather
tones
in
the
fore
palate
the
beer
quickly
transitions
into
cinnamon
and
clovey
spices
the
beer
finishes
with
a
brown
sugar
smack
and
a
warming
glow
of
alcohol
in
the
throat
if
i
had
to
sum
it
up
it
tastes
like
spritzy
newspaper
soaked
in
cola
and
smeared
with
butter
and
cherry
jam
i
love
dubbels
and
have
had
hundreds
of
them
but
honestly
this
is
probably
one
of
the
worst
that
ive
had
drinkability
give
me
more
and
more
and
more
mouthfeel
highly
carbonated
bubbles
multiply
and
expand
in
your
mouth
lots
of
alcoholic
warmth
fairly
light
body
for
a
dubbel
its
a
runoff
between
the
westie
and
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
in
my
book
but
i
think
the
westie
eeks
out
ahead
it
is
perfectly
balanced
with
subtle
fruit
tones
in
the
bouquet
unlike
corsendonks
winelike
aftertaste
the
westmalle
leaves
you
savoring
its
complexity
and
wanting
more
be
sure
to
air
it
out
as
it
gains
more
character
just
below
cellar
temp
also
be
sure
to
serve
it
in
the
proper
glassware
presentation
and
aroma
are
everything
with
a
beer
this
good
definately
a
costwise
alternative
to
abbaye
des
rocs
offerings
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
maybe
not
in
one
setting
thou
abv
was
7
bottle

an
enormous
lasting
head
cloudy

lovely
aroma
of
oak
leather
and
spices
well
balanced
spicy
flavour
slightly
bitter
finish
aftertaste
could
have
lasted
a
bit
longer
but
this
is
still
a
thoroughly
well
made
beer
this
ones
about
average
for
a
trappist
brew
which
means
its
aboveaverage
when
compared
to
most
others
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
brew
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
who
havent
tried
it
i
will
most
definately
buy
it
again

with
quite
a
bit
of

candy
sugar
and
cloveyness
come
across
in
the
nose
same
flavors
are
present
in
the
mouth
as
well
where
a
nice
medium
bodied
beer
goes
down
quite
easily
other
flavors
include
some
fruit
and
a
slight
spicy
twang
burgundy
in
color
with
an
offwhite

excellent

when
sipped

and
somewhat

herbal
spicy
and

it
is
mediumfull
in

with
a

overall
another
excellent
belgian
beer
i
will
definitely
drink
this
one
again
this
beer
poored
with
a
good
frothy
headand
had
some
nice
sweet
aromas
flavors
of
banana
and
sweet
malt
were
good
and
made
this
beer
enjoyable
had
some
yeast
hints
on
the
body
of
this
beer
which
was
nice
and
rich
this
beer
overall
was
a
good
dubbel
and
would
drink
it
again
such
as
plum
and
rasions
medium
body
with
a
light
bubbly
mouthfeel
it
finishes
rather
dry
which
is
a
good
thing
not
the
best
trappist
but
still
great
westmalle
trappist
double
from
a
very
cool
old
bottle
with
westmalle
embossed
in
the
side
cloudy
brownish
beer
that
leaves
a
huge
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
hints
of
the
huge
malts
to
come
the
taste
was
a
very
pleasant
malty
taste
with
chocolatemolasses
overlying
a
biscuity
base
very
nice
warmth
makes
this
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
decking
out
the
tree
the
pour
a
murky
brown
color
with
modest
sized
dark
beige
head
that
is
frothy
in
its
texture
and
the
resultant

fine
velum
like
sheet
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
lightly
tinted
with
banana
slightly
sour
hints
of

front
is
malt
laden
and
somewhat
sweet
with
the

fair
to
middling
in
its
feel
on
the
palate
finish
has
a
prickly
acidity
and
the
hops
pleasing
and
delightfully
spicy
in
their
bite
the
aftertaste
is
desert
bone
dry
and
long
lasting
a
long
favorite
and
one
that
has
a
permanent
home
in
my
dbf
brown
coloring
with
a
fine

very
very

all
over

active
carbonation
taste
is
nowhere
near
as
syrupy
and
cloyingly

as
the
smell
leads
you
to
expect
i
find
this
to
be
a
positive
thing
that
said
the
flavor
is
primarily
more
on
the
sweet
side
although
its
surprisingly
well
balanced
a
worldclass
dubbel
persistent
beige

sits
atop
a

complemented
by

slight

special

and
mellow

sweetness
is

and
is

on
the

all
around

in
the
otherwise
neutral

westmalles
double
is
surprisingly
understated
and
shy
in
malt
and
yeast
character
but
is
nonethless
very
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
a
semi
dark
brew
with
a
light
brown
head
that
stayed
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
some
banana
aromas
mixed
in
with
sweet
dark

aromas
initially
this
has
a
sweet
dark
malty
flavor
of
caramel
and
chocolate
followed
by
a
prune
and
banana
fruitiness
ends
dry
with
barely
any
hop
flavor
not
as
big
flavored
as
i
was
expecting
but
it
still
left
me
wanting
more
maybe
this
is
too
young

nevertheless
i
just
dont
see
the
flavors
here
to
hold
out
much
prospect
pours
with
a
foamy
head
and
a
deep
dark
amber
color
the
earthy
alcholic
belgian
aroma
is
strong
stronger
then
the
flavor
for
sure
the
heavy
malty
flavor
and
obvious
trappist
yeast
character
give
way
to
an
earthy
brush
with
a
ciderapple
flavored
finish
the
bottle
conditioning
has
left
the
carbonation
level
of
the
beer
a
bit
too
high
leavy
a
harsh
mouthfeel
but
that
is
the
only
downside
to
this
tasty
offering

i
found
this

along
with
several

fine
belgians
in
a

needless
to

i
stocked
up

to

a

offering
really
good
beer
but
for
the
price
there
are
some
american
versions
of
dubbels
that
are
better
pours
very
cloudy
aroma
is
nice
but
the
taste
is
excellent
lives
up
to
its
reputation
perfection
the
standard
that
others
are
held
to
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
havent
had
a
lot
of
belgian
dubbels
but
i
can
see
why
people
are
so
high
on
the
belgian
stuff
at
this
point
in
my
beer
journeys
i
think
its
the
yeast
that
is
used
i
really
have
come
to
enjoy
from
belgians
good
stuff
and
when
i
get
the
chance
ill
pick
up
the
yellow
and
blue
bottles
wow
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
i
sampled
it
on
tap
at
the
craft
beer
market
in
calgary
it
has
a
nice
yeasty
nose
caramel
malt
and
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
this
was
my
dessert
beer
and
it
suited
the
purpose
nicely
a
great
belgium
beer
can
definitely
taste
the
water
used
in
this
one
i
dont
think
the
flavors
of
this
beer
work
together
particularly
well
when
the
flavors
are
subtle
such
as
they
are
in
this
one
i
think
a
certain
synergy
is
required
to
elevate
the
beer
overall
a
really
balanced
beer
the
heavier
body
hides
the
alcohol
it
could
be
dangerous
my
only
knock
is
the
metallic
taste
i
got
it
tasted
like
ironblood
it
wasnt
always
present
but
even
i
got
some
it
was
not
very
appetizing
great
dubbel
and
better
than
their
blue
in
my
opinion
the
dark
fruits
character
come
through
nicely
cheers
carbonated
with
a
very
faint
taste
alcohol
is
only
present
in
the
aftertaste
mild
and
drinkable
but
lacking
flavor
and
spice
o
nice
but
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
expected
more
good
balance
between
smoothness
and
maltiness
very
well
balanced
and
well
made
o
very
nice
dubble
hits
many
positive
notes
o
not
bad
but
not
worth
the
price
imo
several
american
attempts
at
the
style
are
far
better
chimay
red
has
a
nice
dark
brown
color
and
smells
yeasty
overall
i
didnt
get
much
fruitiness
in
the
taste
the
alcohol
is
present
on
the
back
end
and
i
like
the
carbonation
on
the
tongue
it
has
a
nice
medium
body
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
much
for
me
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
over
and
over
but
once
in
a
while
its
fine
i
prefer
the
blue
o
spicy
fruity
and
delicious
mouthfeel
is
great
and
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
had
overall
i
like
belgian
beers
and
the
chimay
variants
are
right
up
there
amongst
my
favourites
if
youre
looking
for
supercomplex
flavour
profiles
then
youre
probably
in
the
wrong
place
but
if
youre
looking
to
dip
your
toes
into
the
complex
waters
of
belgian
trappist
beers
there
are
far
worse
places
to
start
this
beer
is
outstanding
its
in
my
top
10
of
all
time
a
style
i
sometimes
run
hot
and
cold
with
but
trappist
monks
in

are
hard

argue

excellent
beer
overall
but
i
feel
that
there
are
better
dubbels
on
the
market
dont
get
me
wrong
i
would
not
turn
this
beer
down
i
just
do
not
feel
that
a
bomber
of
it
is
worth
over
10
us
which
is
what
it
is
going
for
in
some
places
this
is
a
super
high
quality
beer
perfect
in
every
way
complex
tastes
great
presentation
comes
out
a
bit
darker
than
expected
a
little
hazy
but
looks
solid
taste
is
a
little
sweet
with
some
bitterness
goes
down
smooth
but
stays
with
you
in
the
end
reminds
me
of
a
nice
caramel
flavor
along
with
hints
of
fruitiness
overall
this
beer
looks
and
smells
better
than
it
tastes
and
feels
it
is
not
bad
but
for
the
style
it
is
not
the
best
you
will
ever
come
across
and
for
my
money
i
feel
westmalle
do
it
better
by
a
clear
country
mile
overall
obviously
this
is
an
iconic
ale
i
was
little
surprised
at
how
subtle
this
beer
is
very
delicious
blueredwhite
serving
type
bottle
solid
and
smooth
from
draft
overall
this
brew
gave
me
goosebumps
when
i
popped
its
top
this
brew
is
sweet
yet
refined
so
its
not
cloying
sweet
the
nuttiness
adds
a
level
to
the
brew
making
it
more
hearty
that
works
well
with
the
fruitiness
and
the
oats
the
dryness
also
makes
the
brew
easy
to
drink
aching
you
for
another
gulp
theres
nothing
negative
i
can
really
say
about
this
brew
dont
take
my
word
for
it
try
it
for
yourself
this
brew
is
recommended
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
easy
to
find
i
prefer
chimay
blue
to
the
red
but
this
hits
the
spot
for
a
great
belgian
dubbel
average
decent
beer
o
a
wonderful
solid
beer
and
even
though
it
seems
a
bit
obvious
a
great
example
of
the
dubbel
style
it
isnt
flashy
isnt
overwhelming
just
very
very
good

to
me
lots
of
flavours
nice

retention
cloudy
super
refreshing
tasty
but
not
one
of
the
best
trappist
beers
the
king
overall
a
true
belgian
it
is
of
good
quality
and
is
pretty
complex
not
outstanding
but
still
smooth
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
beautiful
loosethick
beige
head
that
dissipates
to
a
film
on
the
top
after
a
couple
of
minutes
apricots
slight
clove
and
bready
yeast
ride
the
forefront
of
the
bouquet
with
a
hint
of
booziness
in
there
somewhere
a
long
sip
led
to
a
smooth
unctuous
mouthfeel
filled
with
sweet
dried
fruit
great
unfiltered
yeast
and
a
sweetness
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
non
bitter
chocolate
with
an
abv
of
7
there
is
an
aftertaste
of
alcohol
but
not
over
powering
by
any
means
a
great
beer
this
beer
is
fresh
and
soft
there
is
no
sweetness
it
is
completely
fermented
its
has
a
fruity
feeling
like
a
south
african
dry
riesling
im
not
sure
if
this
is
the
autolyzed
yeast
for
a
spice
in
the
ingredients
it
has
a
great
dry
wine
taste
at
the
end
nothing
like
the
american
cascade
hops
the
bitterness
i
would
interpret
as
dryness
it
has
a
very
wine
feeling
that
would
seem
more
than
only
the
7
that
it
is
o
great
beer
best
to
appreciate
on
its
own
without
food
overall
a
really
wonderful
beer
delicious
everything
ive
had
from
this
brewery
is
really
pretty
exceptional
i
prefer
the
premi√®re
over
the
chimay
tripel
but
i
still
like
the
grande
r√©serve
the
best
now
i
just
need
to
hop
on
over
to
belgium
to
try
the
dor√©e
really
enjoyed
it
nice
late
night
beer
update

forgot
i
had
half
a
growleralcohol
abuse
cracked
it
open
still
had
carbonation
head
obviously
not
as
pronounced
but
still
one
finger
it
still
tasted
great
something
to
be
said
for
the
craft
beer
bottle
conditioned
belgian
stuff
tasty
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
very
well
balanced
dubbel
not
tiresome
complex
actually
quite
versatile
you
can
drink
this
cold
or
warm
lay
back
or
sensory
hunting
the
big
bottle
for
this
one
is
not
to
be
shared
o
the
benchmark
dubbel
o
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
solid
dubbel
o
best
strong
beer
but
not
the
top
trappistes
beer
i
hope
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
or
old
bottle
because
otherwise
i
cant
see
the
rating
being
so
high
for
this
one
overall
id
say
damn
so
freaking
good
its
good
cold
and
as
it
warms
up
cant
wait
to
drink
more
belgian
beers
in
the
future
a
overall
i
am
not
really
into
dubbels
but
if
i
had
to
drink
one
this
would
be
it
it
is
certainly
a
sweeter
beer
than
i
normally
drink
and
is
almost
liquid
candy
i
can
see
why
many
call
this
the
gold
standard
of
dubbels
ooverall
its
the
standard
that
has
been
set
for
dubbel
overall
i
think
i
would
have
had
different
experience
witha
different
bottle
i
noticed
that
it
was
bottled
in
may
2012
and
while
i
have
heard
that
you
are
supposed
to
age
these
beers
you
can
overage
them
i
think
a
fresher
bottle
would
have
given
me
better
results
maybe
next
time
i
can
get
a
different
feel
on
this
brew
just
enough
bitterness
late
to
even
all
the
sweet
fruit
alcohol
doesnt
hurt
in
that
regard
either
much
preferred
over
the
blue
imho
bubbly
and
fizzy
on
the
tongue
but
taste
was
somewhat
average
with
malty
caramel
and
some
clovelike
spice
mixed
in
but
very
faint
i
was
expecting
to
be
wowed
with
its
almost
legendary
quality
but
its
just
very
good
i
drove
22
miles
to
find
it
but
i
wont
go
to
that
trouble
again
o
not
my
normal
style
of
beer
but
this
is
excellent
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
i
have
been
meaning
to
try
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
just
never
ended
up
picking
it
up
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
will
probably
buy
again
very
good
beer
o
one
of
the
standards
of
the
style
not
nearly
as
good
as
westy
8
nor
is
it
as
good
as
chimay
grand
reserve
but
very
well
done
nonetheless
a
must
try
for
any
craft
beer
aficinado
widely
available
in
the
united
states
d
as
i
mentioned
above
this
one
seems
to
improve
as
you
drink
maybe
its
the
mix
of
sediment
into
the
beer
either
way
i
want
more
o
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
ive
enjoyed
other
belgian
or
belgian
style
beers
ive
tried
id
have
it
again
overall
a
classic
abbey
ale
with
a
yeast
blend
you
wont
find
anywhere
else
smell
slightly
underwhelming
and
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
the
grande
reserve
but
a
fantastic
ale
and

the
flavor
is
light

complex
now
i
see
why
this
is
the
model
the
other
brewers
try
to
copy
the
spicy
but
i
am

been

many

and
american
versions
of
that
style
over
the
last

and
this
is
one
of
the
best
its

of
the
perfect
belgian
dubble
if
you
dont
already
know
what
a
belgian
trappist
tastes
like
then
my
review
slim
as
it
is
isnt
going
to
help
you
anyways
so
either
trust
me
or
dont
so
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
it
again
so
well
balanced
in
fact
that
a
quick
sip
would
lead
one
to
think
this
is
one
dimensional
well
in
that
case
a
touch

this

this
brew
was
a
very
cloudy
chestnut
brown
color
with
tons
of
floating
sediment
in
it
the
head
was
twofingers
of
khaki
bubbles
that
displayed
good
retention
and
excellent
lacing
in
curtains
the
aroma
was
also
excellent
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
a
bit
foamy
a
very
good
beer
and
a

very
rich
complex
beer
its
a
sipper
for
sure
i
personally
would
prefer
more
malt
tastes
and
carbonation
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
a
little
more
subtle
than
other
dubbels
ive
had
its
worth
a
try
but

i

any

the
beer
is

the
brew
is
fairly
quaffable
for
a

a

provide

belgium
ale
style
crisp
and
fruit
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
nice
tight
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
an
excellent
beer
what
you
would
expect
from
an
iconic
brew
like
chimay
the
smell
is
very
rich
with
a
strong
maltiness
and
a
slight
trace
of
yeast
that
made
it
smell
very
much
like
freshbaked
bread
to
me
the
taste
was
very
earthy
with
a
finish
that
reminded
me
very
much
of
the
smell
outside
after
a
rain
during
the
fall
i
know
these
are
very
esoteric
descriptions
but
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
that
was
like
this
so
i
have
very
few
benchmarks
to
go
by
i
could
imagine
enjoying
a
whole
bottle
or
two
with
a
good
meal
so
i
would
consider
it
to
be
fairly
drinkable
overall
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
and
i
think
it
may
have
become
my
new
beer
for
special
occasions
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
two
types
of
chimay
not
at
all
what
i
expected
left
me
pleasantly
surprised
with
my
first
belgian
brew
d
not
a
beer
to
pound
down
all
night
but
very
enjoyable
if
savoured
slowly
for
an
evening
a
good
brew
but
something
i
might
pass
on
later
i
am
now
really
looking
forward
to
trying
the
beer
i
have
set
aside
for
later

d

11
2
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
the
color
is
of
strongly
brewed
tea
reddish
brown
with
bubbles
constantly
climbing
the
sides
of
the
chalice
the
beer
looks
like
it
has
some
substance
to
it
not
thin
at
all
decent
but
not
great
head
retention
with
initial
head
slightly
foamy
the
beer
may
still
be
too
cold
took
out
of
fridge
about
10
minutes
ago
which
may
explain
the
lack
of
retention
the
smell
is
sweet
and
biscuity
with
some
alcohol
the
taste
has
some
sweetness
and
bitterness
that
mix
very
well
with
the
alcohol
very
present
but
not
overpowering
the
mouth
feel
is
surprisingly
light
with
perfect
carbonation
this
is
my
first
chimay
red
but
definitely
wont
be
my
last
i
like
it
pours
out
a
brown
hazy
beer
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
esters
very
subtle
smell
taste
is
extremely
smooth
mostly
a
dry
beer
very
little
in
the
way
of
hopsit
seems
the
yeast
makes
most
of
this
flavorand
being
7
youd
never
know
mouthfeel
is
nicetiny
bit
creamy
a
really
enjoyable
beer
it
pours
a
nice
brown
with
a
moderate
foamy
white
head
better
than
average
head
retention
the
aroma
of
this
is
what
draws
me
in
its
a
slightly
fruity
smell
taste
is
great
as
well
and
is
very
smooth
drinkability
is
high
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
more
after
this
one
probably
more
towards
thin
but
it
was
never
watery
and
it
has
a
refreshing
and
smooth
touch
to
it
goes
down
real
easy
generally
i
prefer
such
beers
thicker
and
richer
with
sweet
malts
to
balance
the
fruits
this
was
light
on
malts
and
high
on
sweetness
but
i
agree
that
it
is
aimed
at
delivering
a
different
punch
altogether
still
a
good
to
great
beer
way
to
go
chimay
pours
a
clear
brownish
copper
with
a
tightly
packed
tannish
white
head
lacing
left
all
over
and
lasts
through
the
finish
looks
very
inviting
and
appealing
aroma
is
of
mainly
of
toasted
malts
some
caramel
and
a
pleasant
fruitiness
as
it
gets
warmer
taste
is
excellent
very
belgianlike
with
hints
of
banana
and
clove
but
not
too
overpowering
some
fruitycirusy
hop
flavors
start
coming
through
with
warming
very
good
on
the
palate
oily
but
rather
thin
on
the
tongue
perhaps
due
to
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
goes
down
very
smoothly
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
superior
belgian
beer
true
to
style
and
highly
recmmended
ive
only
been
able
to
find
the
chimay
blue
and
red
the
red
is
my
favorite
ill
try
to
drink
one
of
these
at
least
once
a
month
this
is
also
a
favorite
of
my
wife
who
isnt
big
on
beer
you
have
to
drink
this
in
a
trappist
chalice
to
enjoy
the
great
aroma
and
creamy
head
this
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
while
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
and
letting
your
mind
wonder
a
truly
great
beer
in
my
opinion
it
has
expressive
carbonation
its
a
good
medium
body
its
not
what
i
was
expecting
flavorwise
but
its
still
a
treat
not
since
drinking
rochefort
10
has
a
few
degrees
of
temperature
so
greatly
affected
my
enjoyment
of
a
beer
once
it
had
warmed
a
little
after
its
30
minutes
in
the
fridge
this
became
quite
delicious
like
most
belgians
it
is
expensive
and
there
are
beers
that
are
nearly
as
good
available
for
much
less
definitely
worth
trying
though
smells
of
raisins
allspice
yeast
an
alcohol
taste
is
front
and
centre
with
bitterness
especially
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
better
with
a
smooth
full
bodied
texture
and
lively
carbonation
continuing
hoping
the
taste
would
improve
with
air
and
warming
the
aftertaste
became
even
more
overpowering
i
wondered
just
how
much
fermentation
was
still
going
on
with
this
one
the
big
alcohol
and
overly
bitter
astringency
took
away
from
the
drinkability
factor
in
my
experience
maybe
this
should
have
been
cellared
a
bit
longer
ill
have
to
try
that
and
see
d
an
amazingly
smooth
beer
almost
perfectly
done
enjoyed
this
after
my
dinner
as
a
treat
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
i
can
see
why
the
big
bottles
are
popular
this
is
my
first
time
drinking
this
out
of
the
11
2
oz
bottle
instead
of
the
large
bottle
dark
red
color
with
a
slight
haze
unless
you
pour
out
the
sediment
then
it
gets
quite
hazy
obviously
great
head
that
retains
well
mild
phenolic
aroma
with
a
hint
of
clove
followed
by
caramel
malt
notes
smooth
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
very
low
hop
bitterness
sweetness
dominates
at
first
and
is
then
followed
by
a
tad
of
caramel
malt
and
complex
peppery
belgian
yeasty
flavors
this
is
much
better
in
the
11
2
oz
bottle
this
is
easily
the
most
balanced
belgian
trappist
ale
ive
had
lots
of
flavors
but
it
wont
kick
your
ass
like
the
other
two
chimays
i
could
go
for
a
couple
more
of
these
this
ale
is
objectively
very
good
definitely
worth
trying
but
its
probably
my
least
favorite
of
chimays
big
three
and
not
one
im
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
when
a
lot
of
variety
is
available
md
body
and
modest
carbonation
somewhat
drinkable
but
isnt
knocking
my
socks
off
this
is
my
first
taste
of
chimay
ive
previously
sampled
all
the
other
trappist
products
except
for
la
trappe
for
whatever
reason
i
find
that
most
dubbels
just
sorta
bore
me
and
this
is
no
exception
despite
it
being
a
finely
crafted
beer
im
looking
forward
to
sampling
the
white
and
blue
caps
shortly
thin
across
the
lips
but
fizzy
and
coating
on
the
tongue
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
the
sweet
taste
covers
up
the
higher
alcohol
content
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
its
only
7
abv
but
im
pretty
sure
the
first
sip
had
my
head
spinning
thank
you
trappist
monks
aroma
is
rich
and
fruity
mainly
malty
with
strong
apple
or
pear
component
and
a
hint
of
spice
it
pours
a
dark
brownish
amber
that
is
somewhat
cloudy
and
has
a
thick
but
not
too
persistent
head
flavor
is
rich
and
satisfying
mostly
malty
strong
fruity
hint
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
or
clove
smooth
and
lipsmacking
it
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
in
the
aftertaste
strongly
recommended
drinkabilty
nice
robust
recommended
malty
aroma
tastes
of
caramel
malt
and
raisins
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
another
beer
shared
with
my
brother
this
tasted
great
as
did
every
beer
we
drank
that
night
another
great
beer
oelergud
poured
a
dark
brownreddish
color
with
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
that
lasted
a
while
the
attractive
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
fruit
the
flavor
is
malty
up
front
with
the
taste
of
dark
fruit
and
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
another
one
i
have
to
thank
my
brother
for
introducing
me
to
outstanding
near
perfection
in
a
bottle
to
me
let
this
one
warm
before
you
drink
it
as
the
flavors
are
best
at
cellar
temperature
d
a
nice
beer
thats
worth
trying
wouldnt
be
a
regular
in
the
line
up
though
d
very
drinkable
despite
the
carbonation
enjoyable
beer
leaving
little
reason
to
stop
at
one
however
not
as
good
as
its
reputation
i
guess
belgians
just
dont
do
it
for
me
after
trying
several
and
of
different
types
im
going
to
just
stay
away
from
now
on
worth
a
try
though
split
a
bottle
over
dessert
made
a
great
pairing
with
tiramisu
and
white
chocolate
cake
the
aroma
was
a
bit
weak
but
not
surprising
for
a
traditional
dubbel
it
smelled
of
the
carmelized
candi
sugar
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
dates
came
out
more
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
very
smooth
caramel
malt
with
a
touch
of
spice
as
my
glass
warmed
subtle
grassy
hops
came
out
not
amazing
but
pleasant
and
tasty
give
this
beer
a
little
time
to
breathe
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
harsh
at
first
d
this
is
a
great
beer
complex
balanced
and
wonderfully
drinkable
bottle
opens
with
a
loud
pop
pours
medium
hazelnut
orangebrown
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
of
belgian
candy
wheat
and
earthy
hops
earthy
hop
taste
hints
of
molasses
faint
malted
wheat
flavor
the
cellared
bottle
taste
a
little
dull
compared
to
the
fresh
one
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
very
good
but
id
not
bother
holding
onto
one
hoping
it
will
mature
futher
the
fresh
one
was
exploding
with
wheat
sweet
candy
balanced
hop
bitterness
d
this
beer
seems
to
suffer
a
bit
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
im
just
not
digging
the
sickening
sweet
aftertaste
that
coats
your
mouth
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
with
lots
of
crimson
head
leaves
something
to
be
desired
no
lacing
to
speak
of
kind
of
weak
in
the
nose
some
toasty
malts
some
dates
some
booze
nothing
bad
about
it
just
lackluster
flavor
is
a
big
improvement
over
the
smell
starts
off
with
toasted
and
roasted
malt
which
leads
into
a
fruit
and
brown
sugar
middle
with
just
a
whisper
of
yeasty
phenolics
finish
comes
back
with
some
more
of
the
higher
kilned
malts
and
a
kiss
of
the
hops
the
weight
of
the
beer
in
the
mouth
is
about
moderate
but
the
carbonation
is
harsh
decent
drinker
but
really
the
weakest
of
the
3
chimays
surprised
to
see
this
on
tap
at
the
liberty
taproom
myrtle
beach
served
in
proper
chimay
chalice
and
a
reasonable
temperature
the
beer
seemed
under
carbonated
especially
for
a
belgian
trappist
and
was
evident
in
the
thin
foamstand
and
the
more
dull
texture
the
aromas
are
candy
sweet
malty
fruity
tart
and
berry
like
flavors
bring
the
same
characteristics
as
the
aromas
and
add
dark
dehydrated
fruits
syrup
sweetness
bread
yeast
and
cherries
the
body
was
firm
and
moderate
despite
the
light
caronation
finishes
quite
sweet
with
a
hop
bittering
true
to
trappist
quality
this
is
one
fine
brew
d
ok
dubbel
a
little
less
exciting
than
i
thought
decided
to
buy
a
case
12
of
the
75ml
corked
bottles
probably
the
first
trappist
that
i
ever
had
about
3
years
ago
pours
a
nice
dark
ruby
red
has
a
nice
off
white
head
but
it
does
not
last
that
long
some
nice
lacing
though
hints
of
fruit
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
well
rounded
fruity
malty
and
the
hops
are
just
noticeable
i
really
enjoy
this
one
although
the
blue
is
my
favorite
d
this
is
a
beer
you
break
out
to
break
away
from
the
norm
i
would
not
reccomend
drinking
a
lot
at
one
time
if
only
so
you
can
savor
it
when
you
do
have
a
bottle
the
bottle
goes
quick
and
you
will
feel
it
a
little
but
youll
feel
better
knowing
you
had
a
classic
brew
its
an
earthy
beer
malts
yeast
spices
banana
a
touch
off
sweetness
and
loads
of
complexity
excellent
i
could
drink
it
all
day
pourd
an
opaque
murky
brown
with
a
hint
of
copper
head
is
a
creammy
soapy
tan
lasts
halfway
through
the
beer
aromas
if
that
of
fruit
and
lovely
yeast
more
like
wine
than
beer
flavor
is
incredable
with
balanced
hop
bitterness
and
a
perfect
sweetnes
all
balanced
in
a
mastered
blend
of
unfiltered
bliss
heavy
body
great
mouth
feel
and
perfect
with
my
steak
the
ceamy
finish
lasts
and
paired
well
with
the
rich
fatty
steak
i
thought
i
had
died
and
gone
to
heaven
for
a
minute
a
tru
winner
if
you
appreciate
real
beer
this
beer
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
all
chimay
products
seem
to
be
my
recommendation
is
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
its
fantastic
d
dangerously
easy
to
drink
a
complex
beer
with
good
balance
and
body
i
am
beginning
to
appreciate
the
belgian
ales
for
what
they
are
true
brewing
art
recommened
very
good
belgian
ale
overall
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
i
had
a
small
bottle
of
this
a
few
months
after
the
original
bomber
and
liked
it
a
lot
more
both
the
aroma
and
flavour
were
more
complex
than
i
recalled
with
a
lot
more
dark
fruits
prunes
plums
a
little
bit
of
molasses
not
sure
where
i
got
the
light
or
unripe
notes
in
my
original
review
as
there
was
none
of
that
in
this
bottle
and
it
wasnt
grainy
at
all
really
enjoyed
it
having
not
had
a
trappist
beer
in
a
while
and
will
grab
some
more
if
its
available
at
the
lcbo
again
very
easy
and
not
complicated
this
is
my
favorite
chimay
a
wellrounded
trappist
ale
with
great
malty
and
yeasty
aromas
looks
nice
in
a
chalice
with
a
small
but
creamy
head
leaving
a
small
lace
tastes
of
bread
malt
mild
bitterness
in
the
end
alcohol
and
mild
carbonation
make
for
an
interesting
taste
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
awesome
great
for
those
winter
days
when
all
you
want
is
to
get
warm
and
drink
something
heavy
a
classic
pours
out
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
12
inch
head
that
dies
to
a
small
ring
brown
sugar
and
fruitiness
everywhere
sweet
with
a
champagne
like
carbonation
light
in
the
mouth
yeasty
with
a
dark
fruitbanana
nose
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
favorite
dubbel
of
mine
it
looks
as
good
as
it
tastes
pours
a
nice
looking
mediumdark
brown
color
with
some
amber
red
hints
as
well
alright
head
that
goes
away
and
leaves
a
little
circle
of
foam
on
top
just
a
touch
of
lacing
nose
is
good
although
fairly
mild
sweetness
a
little
ripe
fruit
malty
goodness
taste
is
good
although
again
pretty
mild
raisins
chocolaty
malt
some
spices
too
feel
is
good
and
pretty
thick
full
body
but
not
cough
medicine
syrupy
overall
this
is
a
good
one
the
bartender
told
me
it
was
far
superior
to
the
white
i
have
to
say
i
totally
disagree
with
her
however
this
one
is
definitely
a
good
and
tasty
buy
d
very
drinkable
due
to
the
smooth
and
not
complex
flavors
and
low
level
of
alcohol
at
7
my
least
favorite
of
the
3
chimays
the
color
was
orangish
brown
as
it
poured
from
the
bottle
and
a
very
attractive
reddish
orangey
brown
in
the
bottle
not
completely
clearsomewhat
hazy
the
head
was
offwhite
very
thick
bubbly
and
foamy
on
the
top
the
smell
was
subtleweak
but
pleasantly
sweet
and
malty
there
were
some
nice
malt
flavors
and
a
pleasant
earthy
aftertaste
the
flavor
is
good
but
pretty
understated
i
thinkid
even
call
it
a
bit
weak
up
front
i
expected
it
to
be
stronger
than
the
chimay
white
so
i
had
the
white
first
today
but
if
anything
i
think
the
white
was
stronger
and
richer
in
flavor
than
the
red
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
drank
this
from
the
11
2
fluid
oz
bottle
with
no
discernible
bottling
date
on
it
poured
this
into
a
tulip
glass
its
a
very
cloudy
reddishbrown
color
a
little
sediment
in
the
glass
a
couple
fingers
of
head
at
first
although
it
settled
down
into
a
thin
offwhite
layer
very
nice
retention
smells
first
of
bread
and
yeast
hints
of
fruit
apples
bananas
and
something
tangier
like
cherries
rich
floral
fragrance
flavors
are
a
little
darker
than
i
expected
opens
up
nicely
in
middle
with
dark
toasted
bread
and
apples
ends
on
a
flat
slightly
metallic
note
but
it
picks
up
with
a
good
aftertaste
like
the
skin
of
a
red
apple
mouthfeel
is
very
light
tiny
bubbles
that
fizz
on
the
tongue
like
a
cola
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
theres
still
a
good
complexity
of
flavors
aromas
and
textures
i
look
forward
to
exploring
it
again
overall
a
great
beer
this
one
is
going
to
go
into
the
books
as
my
snobby
beer
the
one
i
brag
about
and
always
have
on
hand
incredible
taste
and
drinkability
coupled
with
a
damn
good
appearence
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
rustic
brown
in
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
recedes
quickly
and
does
leave
a
bit
of
lace
not
much
though
smell
is
of
fruit
and
honey
also
a
bit
of
orange
peel
taste
is
pretty
impressive
each
sip
brings
a
bit
of
a
different
flavor
to
me
the
sip
has
a
bit
of
a
sweet
fruit
with
a
bit
of
bready
yeast
aftertaste
next
sip
has
a
bit
of
alcohol
plum
taste
this
is
a
pretty
impressive
tasting
brew
i
enjoy
drinking
this
thinking
of
how
its
made
impresses
me
i
do
enjoy
drinking
trappists
beer
and
reading
the
history
of
their
fine
products
i
purchased
this
a
few
months
ago
and
it
probably
aged
some
on
the
shelf
i
didnt
get
much
of
a
lasting
head
and
it
was
a
little
overcarbonated
for
my
taste
and
i
believe
it
is
because
it
might
have
slightly
overaged
the
carbonation
reminded
me
of
some
of
my
homebrews
i
forgot
about
and
discovered
well
after
it
should
have
been
consumed
the
aroma
was
nice
with
a
malty
smell
and
slight
alcohol
it
is
dark
reddish
brown
and
lots
of
floating
yeast
from
the
bottle
carbonation
the
flavor
is
a
wonderful
malty
flavor
that
leaves
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
is
like
fresh
yeasty
bread
a
slight
bitterness
is
lingering
also
which
is
pleasant
great
beer
overall
i
love
it
you
must
try
it
if
you
havent
already
d
the
chimay
beers
set
the
standard
for
drinkability
if
surrounded
by
an
unlimited
supply
i
could
drink
myself
into
oblivion
if
i
am
dying
please
surround
me
with
a
substantial
supply
of
chimay
red
and
blue
i
would
not
regret
anything
long
live
the
very
able
monks
who
continue
this
tradition
got
this
at
a
smallchain
barpub
called
the
fox
and
hound
ordered
it
without
knowing
they
no
longer
served
it
in
chimay
glasses
wtf
still
got
a
gobletstyle
glass
but
it
just
wasnt
the
same
needless
to
say
it
was
the
best
beer
they
had
available
there
they
carry
a
lot
of
shit
pretty
much
every
macro
and
macro
import
you
can
think
of
but
sadly
very
few
good
beers
anyways
this
poured
a
deep
beautiful
dense
ruby
brown
but
still
had
some
clarity
very
nice
thick
offwhite
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
dark
stone
fruit
and
floral
aromas
also
some
caramel
and
toffee
notes
underneath
has
some
red
wine
characteristics
in
the
nose
exceedingly
complex
i
could
smell
this
all
day
just
trying
to
figure
it
out
taste
starts
out
with
some
dark
malt
sweetness
and
is
as
complex
as
it
smells
hops
are
underneath
there
somewhere
providing
balance
ample
carbonation
also
serves
this
mediumthick
bodied
beer
well
finishes
sour
again
reminiscent
of
wine
drinkability
suffers
because
this
seems
so
much
like
a
very
complex
wine
something
you
want
to
sip
only
small
amounts
of
and
enjoy
the
long
finish
i
happen
not
to
particulary
enjoy
sour
or
winey
characteristics
in
a
beer
and
that
is
why
the
taste
and
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
in
my
scoring
also
the
relatively
high
abv
prevents
you
from
having
too
much
of
this
one
definitely
something
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
but
hopefully
in
a
more
relaxed
environment
to
really
appreciate
this
one
d
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
nice
dessert
beer
would
try
again
nice
and
complex
taste
profile
didnt
wow
me
but
i
would
happily
have
again
drinkability
very
good
beer
not
the
best
belgian
dubbel
but
it
is
a
nice
drink
to
share
amoung
friends
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
ale
elegance
to
the
last
sip
as
far
as
drinkability
bring
it
a
great
quality
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
chimay
goblet
it
was
somewhat
cloudy
with
a
big
persistent
head
and
very
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
sour
the
taste
was
sour
and
malty
¬ñ
there
were
some
cereal
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
full
boied
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i¬íd
consider
pretty
drinkable
it
is
a
good
standby
if
you
simply
want
a
belgian
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangebrown
with
a
onefinger
head
vigorous
jets
of
carbonation
at
first
but
then
settles
down
smell
is
fruity
and
a
little
spicy
the
taste
is
malty
and
slightly
spicy
there
is
some
sweetness
but
its
not
too
much
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
rather
fizzy
drinkability
is
decent
but
id
probably
stop
at
two
of
these
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
but
not
my
favorite
belgian
i
had
this
before
an
american
stout
this
one
really
wakes
up
the
taste
buds
followed
a
bit
of
cold
water
nice
deep
brown
red
orange
depends
on
how
the
light
hits
the
glass
gentle
white
head
laces
the
glass
and
coats
the
top
of
the
beer
indefinitely
aromas
of
french
toast
maple
syrup
clove
caramel
malts
dusty
book
pages
fresh
fruit
how
can
all
of
those
things
smell
good
together
this
is
how
the
flavors
are
all
of
the
above
with
the
addition
of
exotic
spices
and
sweet
liqueur
so
many
flavors
and
yet
the
beer
is
so
smooth
and
refined
and
unassuming
in
the
palate
tastes
of
a
recipe
that
was
long
ago
perfected
and
is
no
longer
being
experimented
with
because
the
efforts
would
be
in
vain
solid
chimey
pours
a
cloudy
deep
red
with
a
fizzy
head
aroma
is
rich
dark
ripe
fruit
with
a
slight
yeast
aroma
taste
is
a
caramelized
maltiness
with
a
nice
yeasty
flavor
tart
and
slightly
chalky
the
beer
is
a
little
hoppier
than
i
expected
but
i
really
like
it
its
dryer
than
i
expected
but
still
rich
and
creamy
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
ill
definitely
have
to
pick
this
one
up
again
i
was
thinking
that
it
was
a
bit
pricey
at
6
50
but
for
750ml
its
actually
quite
reasonable
not
my
favourite
style
but
definately
an
enjoyable
treat
my
wife
liked
it
too
so
hopefully
ill
be
able
to
stock
the
fridge
with
it
more
often
drinkability
its
not
bad
not
great
overall
still
recommended
i
just
dont
like
the
carbonation
levels
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
trappist
beers
dubbels
included
this
bottle
just
seems
to
leave
a
lot
on
the
table
d
very
sessionable
taste
mild
but
slightly
strong
in
abv
this
pours
an
deep
dark
with
a
good
solid
off
white
head
that
retained
exceptionally
well
it
has
some
nice
and
spicy
fruit
aromas
and
is
quite
pleasant
raisins
are
very
prominent
very
fruity
flavor
but
not
too
sweet
raisins
are
there
along
with
a
bit
of
banana
strong
alcohol
too
a
nice
silky
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
color
with
some
big
bubbled
head
that
fades
away
pretty
quickly
leaving
a
thin
layer
that
laces
the
glass
smells
spicy
and
fruity
sort
of
orange
raisin
tastes
sweet
and
malty
with
that
strange
yeast
flavor
you
get
from
belgian
ales
some
nice
hoppy
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
finishes
clean
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
scrapes
the
tongue
not
too
bad
though
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
but
i
havent
tried
too
many
belgian
ales
that
i
didnt
like
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
left
some
spot
lacing
the
smell
is
of
dark
raspberries
plums
juicy
the
taste
kind
of
goes
in
the
other
direction
the
initial
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
carob
the
ale
is
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
it
takes
away
from
the
taste
a
bit
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
quite
drinkable
if
ye
wallet
allows
a
super
beer
and
good
example
of
a
dubbel
although
i
generally
favour
tripels
this
will
make
think
next
time
i
am
perusing
the
shelves
recommended
a
hearty
beer
which
tastes
lighter
than
expected
however
for
the
price
i
am
not
sure
its
something
one
would
get
on
a
regular
basis
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
very
filling
it
has
a
good
kick
but
not
too
strong
that
it
catches
up
to
you
too
quickly
i
only
had
a
small
bottle
but
i
could
have
polished
off
a
large
bottle
with
ease
well
its
not
the
first
chimay
option
ill
likely
avail
myself
of
but
id
never
complain
if
this
is
in
my
glass
and
i
think
if
you
looked
up
dubbel
in
the
dictionary
youd
see
the
red
label
for
the
definition
its
a
warm
quaff
with
the
abv
far
from
extreme
but
it
has
its
way
with
the
senses
if
left
unchecked
and
its
nicely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
its
been
around
so
long
and
certainly
longer
than
most
belgians
that
its
easy
to
look
past
but
this
is
one
more
good
reason
to
get
back
to
the
heritage
from
time
to
time
pours
a
clear
burnt
orange
with
a
medium
head
that
leaves
almost
no
lacing
the
smell
is
pretty
strong
with
bread
yeast
cinnamonroasted
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
full
of
roasted
malt
bisquity
flavor
and
some
winter
spices
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
making
this
a
good
beer
that
should
be
triedbut
really
isnt
all
that
exciting
d
quite
drinkable
due
to
its
low
abv
and
inoffensive
aromas
and
flavors
unfortunately
those
traits
help
the
drinkability
score
but
hurt
the
smell
and
taste
scores
i
was
hoping
for
more
adventurous
qualities
to
this
dubbel
but
i
was
taken
aback
by
how
average
and
pedestrian
it
was
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
a
legendary
brewery
i
just
hope
that
someday
chimay
decides
to
tinker
with
the
formula
to
fully
elevate
this
one
to
legendary
statusto
match
the
reputation
of
excellence
that
chimay
posesses
i
dare
say
i
ejoyed
this
almost
as
much
as
one
of
my
favourites
leffe
brune
theres
just
a
persistant
class
and
quality
that
come
with
chimay
beers
and
this
is
definately
no
different
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
but
i
am
not
too
big
on
this
style
it
really
is
a
whole
lot
more
refreshing
than
i
remember
the
bottle
doesnt
have
an
exact
date
just
2006
but
it
does
seem
to
taste
young
i
need
to
get
this
more
than
i
do
totally
luxurious
in
its
mouthfeel
creamy
but
carbonated
and
then
disappears
off
the
tongue
extraordinary
in
this
area
still
it¬ís
not
something
i
would
have
more
than
one
bomber
that
is
of
given
that
it
is
sitting
much
heavier
than
i
would
like
nevertheless
a
beautiful
beer
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
not
get
tired
wellbalanced
would
go
with
most
meat
dishes
probably
a
nice
pairing
with
my
stew
this
evening
od
a
nice
dubbel
that
i
will
probably
try
a
few
more
times
just
to
make
sure
ive
caught
everything
that
this
beer
has
to
offer
personally
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
beer
but
thats
just
me
by
all
means
if
you
havent
already
give
it
a
try
cheers
quite
a
tasty
dubbel
and
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
too
very
enjoyable
and
it
works
great
on
its
own
or
with
a
variety
of
foods
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
wanting
more
i
think
there
are
much
better
dubbels
out
there
for
your
buck
of
the
three
chimays
ive
had
this
is
clearly
my
least
favorite
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
soon
drinkability
always
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
reasonably
nice
beer
drinkable
but
with
time
the
candy
sweetness
became
all
that
i
was
tasting
this
onedimensionality
would
get
tiresome
brownish
red
color
nearly
opaque
it
looks
like
i
have
treasure
inside
my
glass
large
large
head
decent
head
retention
a
thin
layer
remains
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
scent
is
nutty
and
spicy
with
the
malts
coming
through
as
well
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
barley
slight
smell
of
ethanol
the
taste
is
where
is
this
beer
starts
to
really
shine
initially
the
barley
comes
w
a
slight
hop
bitterness
very
fruity
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
apples
and
raisins
with
a
slight
trace
of
ethanol
the
alcohol
hides
behind
the
hops
the
aftertaste
is
dominated
by
the
hops
but
not
too
strong
also
with
a
potassium
like
taste
the
kind
of
feel
you
get
from
tasting
bananas
and
dates
this
one
has
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
and
is
thick
bodied
what
a
treat
going
down
i
swear
i
could
drink
these
all
day
a
lively
pop
from
the
cork
got
about
2
and
a
half
good
pours
into
my
duvel
tulip
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
nice
creamy
head
that
gives
way
to
a
decent
lacing
smell
was
sweet
but
not
obnoxious
taste
was
more
of
the
same
a
very
mild
sweetness
with
some
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
spices
but
only
hints
very
sturdy
beer
i
had
this
chilled
and
intially
the
carbonation
struck
me
as
too
high
and
the
mouthfeel
was
off
as
the
beer
warms
the
carbonation
goes
down
the
sweetness
intensifies
and
the
drinkablity
increases
alcohol
is
not
appearant
a
damn
good
all
round
beer
and
one
that
is
much
easier
for
me
to
get
my
hands
on
than
the
beloved
st
bernardus
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
is
drinkable
widely
available
and
enjoyable
dubbel
i
quite
like
this
a
nice
one
to
bring
out
on
special
occasions
i
become
more
intriqued
and
impressed
with
belgian
styles
with
each
example
i
try
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
would
gladly
purchase
it
again
a
freebie
for
me
thanks
to
my
great
son
¬ìstudying¬î
overseas
in
amsterdam
i
was
sent
this
for
the
unique
chance
to
enjoy
wow
aged
this
bottle
nearly
a
year
and
the
results
were
killer
a
yeasty
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
frothy
thick
head
results
smell
is
of
yeast
multiple
fruits
hoppyness
and
an
alcohol
pungency
taste
is
thick
dark
flavorful
smacks
of
fruit
surround
the
toungue
and
stay
afterwards
superb
for
sipping
after
a
long
day
a
kicker
of
a
beer
and
a
great
dubbel
even
greater
when
aged
dang
pours
a
nice
brownishred
color
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
head
light
body
full
of
flavor
bursting
with
chocolate
plummy
cherries
smell
is
somewhat
metallic
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
really
one
of
the
best
dubbels
out
there
i
like
it
better
than
westmalle
or
any
of
the
other
authentic
trappists
a
good
beer
if
you
can
afford
it
price
is
very
steep
found
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
local
pizza
joint
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
1
12
inch
head
smell
was
very
yeasty
not
all
that
pleasant
taste
was
much
better
slightly
sweet
yet
a
tad
sour
with
a
peppery
finish
a
hit
of
clove
and
other
herbal
notes
came
through
as
well
medium
to
low
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
not
more
than
one
or
two
pair
with
a
nice
red
meat
or
a
mild
soft
cheese
appearance
is
a
dark
rusty
orangeamber
in
color
smells
consists
of
slight
yeast
with
some
apparent
spices
carbonation
is
above
average
head
is
an
off
whittan
in
color
and
lasts
until
the
beer
is
gone
lacing
is
moderate
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
to
it
and
goes
down
quite
well
with
a
slight
aftertaste
to
it
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
the
chimays
and
after
sampleing
the
red
i
will
try
the
other
styles
i
will
be
going
back
to
this
and
have
some
availbale
for
just
sitting
back
and
enjoying
a
really
good
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
helps
to
break
up
the
sweetness
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
this
is
one
of
the
beers
i
crossed
over
into
good
beer
with
it
seems
strange
that
i
waited
until
about
my
250
beer
review
to
review
this
one
a
dam
fine
beer
that
i
will
have
again
a
masterpiece
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
modest
head
that
dissipates
quickly
has
a
great
spicy
sweet
aroma
taste
is
magnificent
this
is
so
much
better
than
their
tripel
i
could
drink
these
for
hours
something
i
wouldnt
try
with
the
grand
reserve
well
carbonated
and
very
well
balanced
drinkability
this
is
decent
but
not
great
good
mouthfeel
great
drinking
beer
definitely
a
nice
belgian
beer
the
taste
is
super
smooth
and
well
balanced
its
not
the
sort
of
beer
that
will
kick
you
in
the
face
its
on
the
milder
side
but
wow
is
it
ever
tasty
and
drinkable
smooth
mouthfeel
with
those
supertiny
bubbles
that
you
occasionally
find
in
a
belgian
this
is
a
darn
fine
beer
a
wow
talk
about
a
foamy
head
you
cant
even
control
the
head
on
this
one
it
is
inevitable
once
the
head
subsides
it
laces
throughout
the
entire
glass
auburnbrown
w
a
tan
head
s
i
smelled
some
scotch
like
hints
and
floral
tones
some
sweet
scent
as
well
t
malty
w
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
there
is
some
sweet
taste
in
there
as
well
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
slightly
above
average
beer
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
its
still
pretty
decent
and
i
would
drink
it
again
of
course
im
more
of
the
porter
type
of
drinker
but
this
is
still
good
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
almost
saisonlike
in
its
delicate
complexity
and
profound
drinkability
d
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
it
almost
forces
you
to
savor
every
drop
this
is
another
wonderful
beer
from
chimay
a
nice
righ
amber
with
a
solid
head
that
lasts
big
caramel
flavors
very
smooth
with
a
hoppy
biscuity
end
not
the
alcohol
bit
that
the
blue
has
which
i
think
is
the
ingredient
that
places
the
blue
above
the
red
incredibly
drinkable
a
tremendous
beer
small
brown
bottle
dark
brown
body
with
fairly
thick
slowly
dissipating
tan
head
smells
malty
and
slightly
sweet
tasty
but
not
as
overwealming
as
some
dubbels
fairly
wellbalanced
definitely
can
taste
the
hops
and
fruit
influences
fairly
heavybodied
very
tasty
a
decent
beer
definitely
can
see
me
drinking
this
again
750
ml
corked
and
bailed
bottle
i
very
much
enjoyed
my
first
trappist
beer
and
look
forward
to
try
all
of
the
rest
although
the
many
amazing
beers
ive
sampled
since
joining
ba
have
cut
into
the
holy
shit
factor
of
this
beer
it
remains
a
nice
choice
and
im
happy
to
return
to
it
from
time
to
time
not
bad
but
not
the
best
dubbel
good
drinkability
for
me
this
is
an
excellent
textbook
representation
of
the
style
with
nothing
thats
going
to
bowl
you
over
but
with
certainly
nothing
wrong
either
pours
to
a
hazy
reddish
brown
with
offwhite
head
that
lingers
thru
most
of
the
glass
and
reduces
to
decent
lacing
had
a
nice
pleasant
aroma
of
dark
fruit
and
malty
sweetness
taste
was
marked
by
just
enough
carbonation
to
add
some
zing
to
the
malty
sweet
dark
fruit
about
34
thru
the
7
alcohol
began
kicking
in
and
this
all
led
to
a
long
warming
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
had
a
rough
day
today
and
wanted
a
religious
experience
didnt
have
one
its
ok
but
westmalle
kicks
the
bejeesus
out
of
it
as
do
many
american
microbrew
versions
its
a
great
example
of
a
dubbel
it
is
hefty
enough
to
be
a
winter
warmer
but
subtle
enough
to
drink
anytime
also
a
great
food
beer
that
will
work
with
spicy
grilled
or
chocolate
very
complex
beer
chimay
master
of
its
craft
has
made
a
good
one
better
coser
to
50
degrees
farenheit
i
enjoyed
it
but
wasnt
thrilled
i
know
there
are
better
trappist
beers
and
these
are
certainly
the
most
marketed
and
available
worth
a
taste
from
any
beer
lover
seems
a
bit
tired
chimays
premiere
is
a
pleasant
beer
if
somewhat
unfulfilling
it
looks
great
pouring
a
nice
reddish
orange
with
a
huge
head
very
appetizing
in
appearance
the
nose
is
a
stunner
its
a
great
mix
of
spice
malt
and
fruit
with
a
touch
of
bread
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
look
and
smell
would
have
you
beleive
its
got
everything
you
can
get
from
the
nose
in
the
flavor
but
sweeter
and
somewhat
thin
it
goes
down
very
easily
but
its
more
like
drinking
a
soft
drink
than
a
beer
da
a
good
looking
great
feeling
ale
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
at
7
abv
bottom
line
very
nice
dubbel
that
should
not
be
overlooked
i
recommend
it
this
beer
pours
to
an
amber
red
orange
with
a
nice
head
enough
to
get
my
mouth
watering
the
scent
was
good
but
nothing
extraordinary
the
taste
was
where
this
beer
lost
me
it
had
a
bit
of
a
sour
or
tart
taste
i
prefer
something
a
bit
smother
mouth
feel
was
good
very
similar
to
a
hefe
overall
to
me
this
seemed
like
an
average
beer
overall
its
not
nearly
as
complex
as
say
a
richefort
or
a
westvleteren
but
then
what
is
but
that
makes
it
a
whole
lot
more
drinkable
overall
d
oh
man
this
is
just
terrific
stuff
the
malt
is
balanced
with
a
bunch
of
other
flavors
and
the
finish
is
just
dry
and
bitter
enough
where
you
get
some
beerlike
qualities
so
you
know
you
arent
drinking
a
sweetmalt
soda
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
not
too
malty
not
too
fruity
very
warming
and
comforting
beer
a
personal
favorite
get
my
buzz
on
y
overall
the
quality
aspect
of
this
brew
is
its
balance
i
am
also
especially
fond
of
tasting
a
little
bit
of
what
i
am
used
tothat
being
the
crisp
and
bitter
hop
character
i
have
come
to
love
in
american
microbrews
it
is
true
to
its
belgian
style
though
with
definite
notes
of
spice
and
some
floral
and
fruity
notes
throughout
this
is
actually
probably
going
to
become
one
of
my
main
session
beers
because
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
three
or
four
of
these
and
not
feel
like
you
ate
a
thanksgiving
dinner
or
be
dead
drunk
recommended
for
certain
drinkability
is
good
it
hides
the
alcohol
really
well
and
is
quite
nice
drinkabilty
would
drink
it
again
but
it
doesnt
have
the
most
compelling
complexity
d
drinkable
but
i
was
expecting
to
be
blown
away
by
this
chimay
not
a
bad
dubbel
though
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
has
an
incredbile
crispness
on
the
palate
its
a
nice
beer
to
drink
while
its
raining
outside
i
wish
i
was
richer
so
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
glistening
with
condensation
as
i
had
left
it
sit
out
and
come
up
from
7c
up
to
about
13c
it
poured
a
wonderful
hazy
cloudy
burnt
orange
colour
with
lots
of
yeasty
debris
floating
about
in
this
particular
bottle
lots
of
sweet
malts
and
yeast
present
in
the
nose
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
dank
basement
sourness
that
is
very
very
faintly
present
that
reminds
me
of
a
saison
its
very
deeply
buried
but
there
nevertheless
the
taste
is
mildly
bitter
with
very
very
faint
hops
sweet
roasted
malt
dominates
with
some
yeast
making
a
bready
appearance
very
quickly
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
wonderful
with
its
pleasant
level
of
carbonation
indeed
one
of
my
all
time
favourite
i
think
the
drinkability
is
hurt
somewhat
due
to
the
feel
still
an
overall
impressive
beer
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
spicy
and
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
aroma
was
light
malt
bread
yeast
and
a
little
roasted
taste
was
thin
and
there
really
wasnt
much
to
it
not
much
matliness
that
i
wouldve
expected
carbonation
was
still
lively
but
it
had
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
i
think
i
need
to
find
a
freash
one
of
these
and
compare
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
pleasantly
tingling
with
carbonation
not
a
challenge
to
drink
complex
yet
approachable
drinkability
good
but
light
for
the
style
a
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
a
night
though
there
are
better
options
within
the
style
and
for
the
price
drinkability
well
i
dunno
as
i
would
have
more
than
1
in
a
night
but
i
will
definitly
have
this
again
a
good
representation
of
the
style
drinkabilityoverall
nearly
as
drinkable
as
the
blue
and
white
but
nowhere
near
as
much
character
complexity
or
development
the
most
boring
of
the
9
but
a
nice
lowkey
nonintensive
way
to
finish
another
epic
madison
style
session
this
is
definitely
a
beer
thats
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
been
able
to
get
your
hands
on
it
you
may
be
missing
out
chimay
premiere
is
simply
a
treat
simply
put
one
of
the
best
damn
beers
ive
ever
had
the
original
chimay
the
way
it
looks
ohhhh
how
i
wish
there
was
a
10
option
fantastic
offwhite
head
with
the
cloudy
orangered
sunset
looking
body
head
recedes
quickly
however
never
does
become
a
ring
the
smell
is
awesome
with
raisins
sugar
molasses
caramel
and
lots
of
other
aromas
id
never
even
dreamed
of
smelling
in
beer
the
taste
is
the
aforementioned
last
sentence
except
the
yeast
kinda
makes
it
metallic
tasting
in
a
way
alcohol
is
well
hidden
although
sort
of
prevalent
at
times
kind
of
like
a
smooth
more
refined
arrogant
bastard
the
mouthfeel
isnt
5
0
but
its
damn
smooth
a
running
trait
of
this
beer
the
drinkability
is
awesome
youll
probably
be
toasted
after
one
bomber
bottle
in
my
case
3
goblets
full
but
damn
is
it
good
wish
it
lasted
longer
and
i
had
a
tap
of
this
in
my
house
smooth
and
sweet
perfect
or
in
another
case
brilliant
cant
wait
to
try
the
blue
label
dubbel
might
be
my
new
favorite
style
of
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
quite
thin
but
nicely
carbonated
a
very
easy
drinking
dubbel
for
the
style
it
doesnt
interest
me
nearly
as
much
as
st
bernardus
or
westmalle
but
it
certainly
isnt
bad
this
is
a
classic
not
a
sipping
beer
a
mouthfull
gives
the
best
taste
and
mouthfeel
best
served
not
very
cold
all
in
all
you
want
to
drink
lots
of
this
trappist
concoction
drinkability
could
use
a
little
bit
more
in
the
flavor
department
but
drinkability
is
good
absolutely
drinkable
picked
this
up
at
the
local
grocery
store
after
53
hours
of
work
this
week
i
deserved
a
trappist
d
i
got
the
corked
bottle
and
poured
it
into
my
tulip
glass
a
nice
frothy
head
typical
of
most
belgians
formed
upon
the
pour
i
was
suprised
to
see
the
head
fall
almost
immediately
this
is
very
possibly
due
to
the
fact
that
i
havent
used
this
glass
in
awhile
and
my
mom
was
the
last
to
wash
it
color
is
reddish
copper
and
alittle
hazy
very
sexy
aroma
is
strong
and
has
the
honeyfruit
aroma
that
is
present
in
many
trappist
ales
taste
is
initiated
with
a
blast
of
honeyfruitiness
i
want
to
say
plum
but
i
dont
really
eat
them
so
im
not
sure
the
flavor
leaves
with
a
sweet
bitterness
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodies
with
a
nice
carbonation
you
can
feel
the
bubbles
forming
on
your
tongue
with
every
sip
drinkability
is
good
for
a
trappist
ale
if
i
had
the
money
this
would
be
a
good
sessions
beer
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
a
very
fine
brew
great
for
a
special
occasion
when
you
cant
spring
for
rochefort
this
is
alot
better
than
ommegang
and
a
tad
bit
better
than
unibroues
la
fin
du
monde
which
i
feel
tastes
alot
like
this
another
corked
beer
vintage
jan
2006
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
thick
head
that
settles
quickly
leaving
some
lace
around
the
rim
its
got
a
very
light
carbonation
with
creamy
undertones
very
clear
and
light
almost
a
thinned
out
version
of
grand
reserve
with
its
darker
color
and
fair
amount
of
sediment
and
as
mellow
and
smooth
as
this
beer
is
youd
never
guess
its
a
7
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
nice
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
molasseslike
aroma
as
well
as
some
fruit
it
tasted
sweet
not
too
sweet
dark
fruit
and
maybe
a
little
chocolate
nicely
carbonated
i
could
sit
and
drink
this
beer
for
hours
on
a
personal
note
i
have
been
finding
that
dubbels
are
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
though
i
still
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
might
wanna
keep
that
in
mind
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
how
easy
this
is
to
consume
very
laid
back
and
mellow
alcohol
is
there
but
not
in
your
face
at
all
great
beer
by
chimay
shared
a
big
bottle
with
a
fellow
beer
lover
pours
out
a
dark
amber
or
even
brownish
color
good
size
head
3
fingers
at
least
it
smelled
of
yeast
fruit
and
you
could
detect
the
alcohol
as
well
it
had
a
much
more
malty
flavor
and
it
had
a
spicy
kick
also
it
had
a
crisp
mouthfeel
the
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
little
heavy
overall
chimay
proves
they
know
beer
as
one
of
the
six
trappest
ales
this
marks
a
great
start
to
our
flight
of
chimay
ales
next
up
cinq
cents
my
first
chimay
white
was
special
because
it
was
the
first
big
beer
i
purchased
in
nc
after
they
popped
the
cap
my
second
one
blue
hit
the
spot
because
i
brought
it
to
share
on
a
cruise
at
my
brothers
bachelor
party
plus
it
tasted
reallll
good
i
picked
this
one
red
because
it
was
3
50
and
the
place
had
cimay
glasses
to
drink
them
out
of
the
coolest
part
of
this
was
all
the
bubbles
that
floated
only
to
the
middle
of
the
glass
taste
was
nothing
special
notes
of
fruit
and
caramel
but
served
way
too
cold
this
is
a
wonderfultasting
beer
but
its
a
little
too
heavy
to
get
a
higher
mark
as
far
as
drinkability
aside
from
that
its
very
solid
and
one
of
my
favorites
ill
usually
pick
up
either
this
or
the
blue
when
i
cant
decide
what
else
i
want
to
get
slightly
hazy
dark
copperishred
with
a
mediumsized
offwhite
frothy
slowly
diminishing
head
hardly
a
speck
of
lacing
smell
is
of
some
yeast
some
light
grain
and
lots
of
woodsy
spice
clove
banana
vanilla
grape
alcohol
and
cassis
the
taste
is
all
about
the
clove
from
the
second
it
hits
your
lips
until
after
almost
all
other
flavors
have
dissipated
on
the
mediuminduration
finish
this
looked
and
smelled
like
a
worldclass
beer
but
the
taste
didn¬ít
wow
me
and
the
mouthfeel
i
thought
was
a
little
thin
and
too
carbonated
but
still
definitely
very
good
and
very
drinkable
it
smells
fantastic
goes
down
smooth
a
little
head
from
the
bottle
going
into
the
glass
and
it
settled
perfect
just
an
all
around
great
tasting
beer
i
passed
it
to
several
friends
who
arent
big
beer
people
and
they
all
raved
about
it
and
couldnt
believe
it
was
7
btw
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
especially
at
7
enjoy
d
i
do
like
this
as
mentioned
before
its
a
heavier
beer
so
too
much
wouldnt
work
for
me
very
tasty
though
i
have
no
complaints
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
another
of
but
i
do
tend
to
prefer
slightly
less
sweet
beers
and
the
alcohol
content
although
not
ridiculiously
high
at
7
did
sort
of
sneak
up
on
me
i
think
two
of
the
11
3
oz
bottles
would
be
enough
for
me
most
nights
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
mediumbodied
with
rather
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
tasty
with
a
reasonable
abv
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
would
be
great
with
a
meal
its
so
smooth
and
sweet
just
overall
surprisingly
drinkable
for
being
somewhat
complex
and
flavorful
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
traditional
belgian
dubbel
easy
drinking
flavourful
with
malts
dominant
and
spice
characteristics
there
to
keep
you
interested
loved
this
beer
and
will
certainly
have
it
again
overall
an
excellent
dubbel
give
it
a
try
flavors
were
a
hybrid
of
exotic
spices
good
ol
pepper
obvious
but
noncloying
alcohol
raisins
wild
yeast
subtleties
and
a
solid
maltherbal
presence
that
indicated
a
topnotch
grain
bill
super
enjoyable
just
about
a
quintessential
belgian
ale
much
better
from
the
tap
than
any
bottle
ive
had
it
is
a
delicious
beer
though
i
prefer
the
white
chimay
a
bit
more
and
the
blue
chimay
much
more
i
cant
seem
to
find
a
lot
maltbitterness
or
chocolaty
flavor
in
general
this
is
a
bit
disappointing
i
drank
this
beer
before
and
then
i
was
very
happy
with
it
not
that
it
is
bad
now
but
for
sure
less
interesting
overall
this
is
chimays
best
offering
in
my
opinion
or
at
least
the
one
they
really
shine
best
on
however
with
the
alcoholic
content
you
cant
really
drink
too
much
of
this
otherwise
youll
be
taking
a
pleasant
nap
i
love
the
blue
chimay
but
the
red
one
is
just
not
glass
of
beer
at
all
mouthfeel
is
smooth
caramely
sugary
with
creamy
vanilla
sliding
along
the
tongue
very
clean
with
sugary
vanilla
esters
and
light
caramel
standing
up
to
the
challenge
this
is
an
excellent
beer
those
with
more
exposure
to
dubbels
might
have
more
sophisticated
comments
to
make
for
those
like
me
i
think
you
should
go
for
it
this
is
a
very
refined
experience
youll
enjoy
it
immensely
drinkability
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
certainly
one
ill
keep
drinking
again
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
i
will
have
to
try
this
one
again
just
to
compare
notes
but
i
didnt
enjoy
this
chimay
nearly
as
much
as
the
hype
in
fact
i
didnt
enjoy
it
at
all
one
of
the
better
belgian
beers
on
the
market
it¬ís
also
easy
to
find
which
is
certainly
a
plus
my
only
complaint
is
that
it¬ís
a
bit
pricey
like
the
other
chimays
the
price
isn¬ít
outrageous
but
there
are
equally
good
if
not
better
beers
of
this
style
that
aren¬ít
as
expensive
otherwise
it¬ís
drinkable
complex
and
very
tasty
highly
recommended
d
its
decent
ill
drink
it
again
eventually
im
sure
but
overall
this
is
the
least
of
the
chimays
chimay
red
here
we
go
poured
a
lovely
dark
orange
close
to
amber
color
with
a
large
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
perfect
lacing
that
lasted
right
up
until
the
end
of
the
glass
in
the
nose
i
smelled
strong
alcohol
candy
sugar
a
bit
of
fruit
here
and
there
i
suspect
that
more
smells
would
surface
if
the
beer
warmed
up
a
little
bit
taste
was
excellent
with
figs
syrupy
sweetness
juicy
fruit
also
a
slight
medicinal
taste
to
it
as
well
im
usually
not
crazy
about
the
medicinal
sides
of
many
beers
but
this
one
wasnt
overpowering
at
all
in
the
end
made
it
a
better
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
mouthfeel
was
the
highlight
for
me
the
beer
was
just
perfectly
balanced
and
a
real
thrist
quencher
i
love
the
prickly
feeling
you
get
when
tasting
this
one
it
was
also
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
think
even
wine
lovers
would
have
appreciation
for
the
vast
complexities
within
this
beer
its
funny
i
always
used
to
see
chimay
sitting
on
the
shelf
at
the
atlas
liquors
back
home
all
the
time
and
never
even
considered
getting
it
guess
i
still
have
alot
to
learn
about
good
beer
cheers
mouth
this
beer
had
excellent
whole
mouth
stimulation
and
a
warming
alcoholic
exhale
after
the
swallow
tasted
of
sweet
fresh
raw
bread
dough
and
had
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
an
excellently
balanced
bittersweet
after
taste
very
quffable
a
good
starting
point
for
those
whove
never
tried
doubles
not
the
best
but
pretty
close
imho
overall
i
like
this
ale
it¬ís
well
balanced
and
lacks
the
metallic
notes
i¬íve
seen
in
many
others
given
its
price
however
i¬íd
keep
looking
worth
a
try
cheers
i
think
this
ones
my
favorite
of
the
regular
three
chimay
offerings
at
least
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
could
easily
polish
off
a
750
ml
of
this
not
terribly
complex
even
a
bit
simplistic
in
comparison
to
the
acclaimed
examples
of
the
style
but
its
good
and
easy
drinking
i
like
it
copper
in
colour
with
sweet
fruit
and
yeasty
aromas
coupled
with
faint
notes
of
darker
toasted
malts
flavor
wise
it
begins
quite
sweet
but
dries
quickly
and
becomes
bitter
with
some
earthyoaky
qualities
the
alcohol
is
also
very
upfront
which
was
a
bit
of
a
drag
still
a
reasonably
good
product
but
i
think
i
still
prefer
the
chimay
bleu
its
a
bit
more
complex
sampled
at
a
shared
tasting
in
venice
italy
light
ruby
unpleasantly
aromatic
with
notes
of
bread
medicines
seawater
salt
green
plants
and
dark
fruits
dark
fruits
reside
but
the
entire
front
and
midpalate
is
completely
nonexistant
the
finish
however
is
lovely
lingering
and
full
of
a
malty
sweetness
once
again
though
my
main
problem
as
with
all
the
chimay
beers
is
the
total
lack
of
body
gentle
overall
and
the
complete
lack
of
character
from
the
front
to
the
mid
is
what
disappoints
most
its
just
one
dimensional
especially
in
the
aroma
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
smell
and
taste
of
bananas
in
this
beer
i
truly
enjoyed
the
feel
of
it
it
my
mouth
smooth
and
sweet
and
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
the
taste
improved
as
the
beer
sat
in
the
glass
i
could
drink
this
the
whole
night
but
would
prefer
to
mix
it
up
for
an
extra
dollar
the
blue
label
chimay
makes
a
much
better
deal
in
my
opinion
burnished
orangebrown
body
with
a
generous
tan
head
the
nose
shows
herbal
almost
indian
spices
dried
fruit
and
malt
for
some
odd
reason
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
hot
dogs
yeah
hot
dogs
theres
malt
midpalate
with
a
mild
bitterness
in
there
too
this
one
drinks
soft
and
easy
its
perfectly
drinkable
but
im
not
sure
that
it
offers
too
much
poured
a
murky
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
creamy
tan
well
sustained
head
of
a
quarter
inch
smell
is
a
musty
mix
of
maltiness
yeast
bread
cheese
maybe
and
some
slightly
fruity
aromas
mouthfeel
is
ultra
smooth
and
creamy
carbonation
some
slight
ginger
medium
malt
profile
bit
of
medicinal
flavor
tinge
of
coriander
slight
spice
and
a
yeasty
dry
finish
that
seems
to
coat
the
back
of
the
throat
and
roof
of
the
mouth
with
a
powdery
feel
for
a
moment
a
very
creamy
and
well
balanced
dubbel
i
do
favor
the
other
chimay
brews
a
little
more
solid
belgian
dont
know
if
its
quite
worth
what
it
costs
but
its
still
pretty
darn
good
this
is
a
good
beer
but
for
the
price
there
are
many
others
that
i
would
rather
spend
the
money
on
chimay
premiere
poured
a
dark
red
color
with
a
frothy
head
that
left
a
nice
layer
of
lace
on
the
glass
there
wasnt
much
of
an
aroma
from
this
one
just
a
light
malty
smell
taste
was
more
impressive
however
with
a
rich
malty
chocolatey
flavor
this
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
had
a
portlike
character
to
it
very
drinkable
sort
of
the
little
brother
to
the
chimay
grande
reserve
there
are
better
dubbels
out
there
but
this
one
is
worth
the
5
99
i
spent
on
it
overall
very
rich
and
complex
much
more
so
than
im
able
to
comment
on
extremely
enjoyable
and
begs
inquiry
the
depth
and
refinement
of
this
beer
is
certainly
there
some
american
attempts
at
dubbels
fall
far
short
in
my
opinion
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
all
by
it
self
i
actually
wish
i
wasnt
having
this
with
a
meal
because
i
would
have
like
to
enjoy
the
varied
nuances
of
it
alone
well
sometime
in
the
near
future
im
sure
i
will
flavor
is
much
better
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
dates
figs
green
apples
and
even
a
tiny
bit
of
wintergreen
mint
ever
so
slight
bitter
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
but
one
sip
does
not
beg
for
another
drinkability
is
good
but
the
alcohol
does
make
itself
present
after
a
glass
deep
garnett
color
carbonation
bubbles
and
particals
of
yeast
can
be
seen
the
head
is
not
as
sticky
as
i
would
like
but
the
retention
is
awsome
the
aroma
is
slighty
fruity
and
bread
like
some
alcohol
sweetness
can
be
detected
in
the
backgrown
has
a
fruity
and
yeasty
taste
up
front
balanced
out
nicely
with
a
roasted
malt
the
aftertaste
is
slighty
sour
and
fades
away
slowly
once
again
a
great
ale
from
chimay
paid
2
07
euro
for
a
bottle
looks
ok
murky
dark
brown
with
touch
of
red
good
head
that
dissipates
smell
is
ok
healthy
malt
and
spice
but
lacking
greatness
taste
is
again
strong
malt
some
burnt
some
candied
sugar
a
bit
of
fruit
tough
to
get
past
the
carbonation
very
fizzy
nearly
overwhelming
and
definitely
interferes
with
the
enjoyment
of
this
otherwise
ok
beer
taste
is
nothing
exceptional
looks
fantastic
medium
non
trasparent
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
read
lot
of
particles
floating
around
in
there
which
i
love
to
see
in
a
brew
smells
good
too
sweet
fruits
and
melons
the
taste
is
very
nice
as
well
actually
despite
the
reviews
i
think
i
like
this
beer
better
than
the
chimay
blue
sweet
malts
are
followed
by
a
subtle
hop
profile
and
the
finish
is
a
little
smoky
to
me
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
nice
too
medium
body
and
very
smooth
drinkability
is
nearperfect
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
isnt
an
awful
beer
but
i
was
very
disappointed
as
i
know
chimay
can
make
some
great
brews
this
one
really
needs
to
lose
the
watery
blandness
i
will
try
this
again
perhaps
the
second
bottle
will
fare
better
a
very
enjoyable
beer
just
solid
in
every
aspect
nothing
that
blows
you
away
but
enough
there
to
give
you
an
appreciation
for
this
fine
brew
this
must
have
been
my
introduction
to
chimay
because
i
remember
tasting
it
for
the
first
time
and
saying
whats
the
big
deal
while
this
is
a
good
beer
i
still
feel
that
way
if
youre
springing
beer
this
fancy
you
can
do
better
my
friend
color
was
a
deep
orange
and
amber
with
hues
of
rose
a
little
hazy
even
the
cap
was
off
white
with
orange
hue
cap
started
off
nice
and
big
but
dissipated
quickly
to
a
quarter
inch
and
just
sat
there
waiting
aroma
is
grainy
yeasty
and
citrus
can
smell
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
green
apples
smell
was
very
strong
at
first
but
got
faint
by
the
time
i
was
ready
to
take
a
drink
my
taste
buds
filled
with
sweet
fruitiness
yet
still
light
and
refreshing
vinous
quality
that
blends
well
into
the
slight
bitterness
of
the
floral
hops
lightmedium
body
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
finished
slightly
dry
and
very
refreshing
wonderful
beer
and
will
definitely
have
again
damn
near
shot
my
eye
out
when
the
cork
just
wouldnt
budge
then
blammo
anyhow
appearance
is
a
very
dark
murky
orange
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
stuck
nicely
and
left
a
nice
lace
aromas
are
sweet
and
floral
but
not
real
intense
more
subtle
than
i
was
expecting
very
nice
taste
in
this
one
sweet
yes
as
others
have
noted
but
i
like
it
it
has
a
nice
fruity
malty
and
floral
taste
that
leaves
your
mouth
a
bit
sticky
feeling
overall
a
great
beer
i
think
ill
have
another

very
drinkable
could
have
easily
had
more
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
to
order
at
a
ski
resort
a
very
nice
way
to
reward
yourself
for
whatever
explosive
¬ñ
the
cork
literally
flew
out
of
the
top
of
this
bottle
as
soon
as
i
loosened
the
wire

color
with

it¬ís
a
very
murky
rustic
appearance
with
an
everpresent
beautiful
white
head
nice
looking
beer
there¬ís
no
doubt
about
it
the
aroma
is
a
little
muted
but
there¬ís
some
notable
esters
and
phenols
clove
and
raisins
there¬ís
a
little
malt
and
caramel
in
the
smell
both
of
which
show
up
in
the
taste
no
hop
presence
at
all
in
the
smell
and
just
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
yeasty
i
expected
to
sense
a
little
alcohol
but
it¬ís
very
well
hidden
despite
high
carbonation
this
one
is
extremely
smooth
almost
creamy

some

taste
is
rich
with

wellattentuated
toasted
crystal

andor
candi
sugar
raisins
and
dates
and
organic

the
aftertaste
holds
a
spicy
alcoholic
kick
coupled
with
very
mild
hop
bitterness
and
a
belgian
tart
and
slight
dryness
that
cleanses
the
residual
sugars
this
creates
a
wonderfully
balanced
flavor
while
preventing
any
lingering
sweetness
in
the
finish
and
thus
a
high
drinkability
the
alcohol
and
yeast
notes
are
detectable
but
more
of
a
pleasent
farewell
than
solvent
or
puckering
the
carbonation
and
body
are
at
a
medium
level
leaving
the
mouthfeel
both
textured
and
crisp
the
hansome
smoothness
complex
flavor
and
delicate
balance
of
flavors
make
this
a
real
treat
worth
waiting
for
cheers
this
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
thick
head
it
smelled
nicely
hoppy
its
flavor
was
of
subtle
hops
and
spices
and
very
smooth
though
almost
watery
i
felt
that
it
had
great
flavor
but
it
was
too
faint
to
be
properly
enjoyed
which
hurts
its
overall
rating
i
wish
to
try
this
one
again
to
give
it
a
second
chance
in
case
the
first
was
in
some
way
defective
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
a
huge
head
that
holds
fantastically
and
laces
great
the
beer
has
a
similar
smell
and
taste
the
most
discernable
flavors
that
i
can
distinguish
are
cherries
plums
and
raisins
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
and
the
carbonation
is
even
it
feels
fantastic
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
have
come
to
really
appreciate
the
chimay
line
this
is
the
best
chimay
imo
the
flavor
is
pretty
subtle
but
nice
and
the
feel
is
great
a
little
phenolics
a
little
malt
and
it
dries
out
in
the
finish
a
pop
beer
that
is
very
accessible
but
still
very
nice
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
and
exceptional
example
of
a
dubbel
quite
disappointed
theres
just
not
a
lot
to
this
has
a
crisper
feel
not
as
smooth
as
the
other
chimay
verities
the
finish
boasts
a
bitter
dried
fig
flavor
an
excellent
flavor
to
be
sure
though
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
another
comment
i
have
is
that
the
corked
and
crowned
version
although
the
same
beer
may
need
two
different
review
areas
as
they
seem
to
develop
in
the
bottle
differently
this
beer
was
very
easy
for
me
to
drink
it
is
nice
to
take
a
break
from
hoppy
beers
for
a
while
poured
this
beer
into
a
duvel
glass
i
do
not
have
a
chimay
glass
poured
with
a
nice
big
head
which
diminished
to
12
inch
nice
deep
orange
brown
deep
sweet
with
citrisy
notes
i
am
going
to
cut
this
review
short
the
seahawks
game
is
on
will
update
after
the
game
medium
body
with
a
crispness
and
carbonation
gives
this
a
nice
mouthfeel
overall
a
nicely
balanced
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
i
would
rank
this
as
good
as
the
blue
and
better
than
the
white
wonderful
stuff
pours
a
murky
reddish
brown
clorox
and
has
a
very
lively
carbonation
its
head
is
off
white
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lace
in
my
glass
it
has
a
very
spicy
aroma
and
i
swear
i
smelled
tobacco
in
there
and
a
hefe
like
clove
the
flavor
is
just
as
nice
with
a
terrific
blend
of
spice
and
nuttiness
and
again
a
hefe
like
clove
that
stands
out
from
the
sweetness
its
only
flaw
in
my
opinion
is
that
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
is
too
good
for
its
alcohol
content
i
could
drink
these
all
night
nice
reddy
brown
hue
coupled
by
a
sweet
malty
smell
the
taste
is
not
quite
as
sweet
or
syrupy
as
other
trappists
ive
had
well
balanced
malts
and
the
sugar
does
not
overpower
hops
add
a
decent
bitterness
to
it
id
love
to
try
blue
and
white
next
interestingly
the
first
thing
i
noticed
upon
drinking
it
was
the
alcohol
warmth
then
that
subsided
and
i
really
couldnt
taste
much
of
anything
a
rather
watery
beer
i
think
im
comparing
it
with
the
blue
with
which
i
am
more
familiar
been
drinking
that
stuff
on
occasion
for
over
17
years
i
was
expecting
the
thick
sweetness
of
the
blue
and
it
just
wasnt
there
not
an
utter
disappointment
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
carbonation
cuts
the
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
and
makes
the
mouthfeel
very
pleasant
looking
at
my
glass
the
beer
is
almost
gone
already
great
drinkability
overall
a
dssapointment
not
really
a
clear
taste
with
too
much
carbination
light
to
medium
in
body
and
quite
drinkable
d
wonderful
i
could
drink
this
belgian
ale
all
day
it
isnt
too
strong
and
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
it
would
go
well
with
a
lot
of
foods
pours
a
cloudy
orange
brown
with
a
white
1
finger
head
good
longevity
and
very
good
lace
smells
malty
and
yeasty
some
spicyness
and
brown
sugar
notes
yeasty
malty
and
sugar
tastes
with
some
lingering
bitterness
slightly
fruity
dry
and
highly
carbonated
i
know
thats
is
the
way
its
supposed
to
be
but
i
think
it
makes
it
harder
to
drink
as
it
makes
me
feel
more
full
a
good
brew
but
not
outstanding
pours
a
dark
orangebrown
and
forms
a
large
thick
head
that
is
slow
to
dissipate
smells
a
little
alcoholic
with
grains
and
earthiness
as
well
tastes
a
little
subdued
bready
and
sweet
with
some
orange
and
cherry
fruits
as
well
feels
creamy
but
a
little
thin
and
not
quite
as
warming
as
i
might
like
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
certainly
have
gone
for
another
after
i
finished
this
one
cork
popped
off
this
wonderful
brew
like
a
bottle
of
fine
champagne
poured
to
a
dark
amber
with
a
puffy
foamy
head
that
formed
very
quickly
likely
due
to
the
secondary
fermentation
in
the
bottle
smell
is
earthy
and
clean
the
taste
is
phenomenal
delicate
earthy
flavors
accompanied
by
a
nice
light
earthy
aroma
carried
by
the
carbonation
ever
so
delicately
throughout
the
palate
carbonation
is
sufficient
and
this
goes
down
very
very
smooth
very
drinkable
indeed
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
have
two
more
bottles
of
this
i
think
i
will
be
saving
them
for
a
special
occasion
overall
a
quality
beer
ive
had
it
many
times
before
and
recall
it
being
better
than
this

really
nothing
special
here
to
speak

i
honestly
think
the
whole
chimay
thing
is
overhyped
the
only
time
i
can
see
buying
this
again
is
right
at

theres
a

of

several

the

prevented

from

the

and
the

kept

the

has
a

altogether
this
remains
my
least
favourite
of
the
chimays
give
me
a
bleu
please
still
a
decent
beer
but
with
the
trappists
i
expect
more
will
rerate
when
i
personally
control
the
temperature
and
the
pour

what
else
can
you
say
these
monks
can
make
some
beer
i
have
yet
to
meet
a
belgiun
beer
i
didnt
like
and
chimay
rood
in
a
goblet
poured
from
a
bottle
is
so
right
on
i
love
the
color
the
smell
the
flavor
is
perfectly
balanced
for
me
i
have
always
loved
chimay
since
the
first
time
i
saw
michael
jackson
sipping
his
way
through
the
trappist
breweries
of
belgium
it
is
quintessential
a
must
try
notes
i
almost
gave
this
beer
a
mediocre
review
then
i
let
it
warm
up
more
this
needs
to
be
served
at
the
correct
temp
1015
degrees
below

i
think
its
a

of
fun
and
i
hope
to
try
some
more
and
the
rest
of
chimays
offerings
drinkability
and
overall
a
good

a

as

certainly
no
sloucher
though
could
be
earthshattering
to
one
who
has
never
tried
a
trappist
beer
before
i
found
this
beer
to
be
easily
drinkable
while
there
are
probably
better
dubbels
in
belgium
this
is
a
good
one
to
start
offf
with
it
also
helps
to
have
the
chimay
goblet
as
it
seems
to
add
something
extra
to
the
experience
this
is
one
of
the
best
allaround
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
is
a
beer
that
truly
reminds
me
why
beer
is
classified
as
a
type
of
food
pours
a
golden
color
with
slight
cloudiness
smells
of
belgian
grain
and
bread
tastes
malty
with
good
floral
hoppy
finish
yeast
predominates
throughout
the
drink
this
is
one
beautiful
beer
it
is
no
trouble
to
drink
a
750ml
bottle
like
it
was
a
12oz
not
overly
complex
but
surprisingly
good
really
had
a
great
memory
of
this
did
not
quite
live
up
to
that
though
i
much
preferred
the
chimay
red
over
the
blue
contrary
to
the
ba
avg
rankings
perhaps
the
bottle
of
blue
i
had
was
skunked
because
there
was
a
huge
different
in
yeasty
taste
as
i
took
a
step
down
the
ladder
to
the
red
the
yeast
in
the
red
was
present
in
the
taste
but
it
was
much
better
masked
by
the
typical
if
it
could
be
called
that
blend
of
spices
fruits
candy
flavored
malts
the
alcohol
content
is
significantly
lower
thus
making
this
much
more
drinkable
though
it
still
weighs
in
at
a
rather
hefty
7
even
though
this
beer
made
up
for
my
disappointment
with
the
blue
i
havent
been
completely
convinced
that
chimay
is
worth
all
the
hype
nonetheless
i
will
definately
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
when
money
permits
and
i
dont
necessarily
need
to
treat
myself
to
something
such
as
an
abt12
or
rochefort

i
have
already
lined
up
another
bottle
of

from
an
alternate
source
though
which
will
hopefully
produce
better
results

me

this

is
the
best
tasting
ive
ever
had

velvety
smooth
while
slightly
thinned
by
carbonation
i
would
drink
this

pours
mahogany
with
a
thick

head
aroma
of
cloves
biscuits
a
bit
winey
and
some
dark

taste
was
some
malt
and
fruit
up

with
some
spices
and
biscuit
in
the
middle
and
a
warming
finish
with
a
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
almost
crisp
at
first
but
grew
creamy
and
smooth
as
it
warmed
this
is
fine
brew
and
very
readily
available
sure
the
white
and
the
blue
are
even
better
but
this
is
a
fine
dubbel
the
drinkability
is
excellent
for
this
type
and
maybe
my
favorite
in
the
chimay
family
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
certainly
nothing
to
get
really
excited
about
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
it
really
could
use
a
boost
in
the
malt
intensity
body
department
though
it
just
seems
a
bit
thin
750
ml
bottle
poured
in
an
oversized
wine
goblet
i
was
able
to
get
the
whole
bottle
in
the
glass
with
room
to
spare
the
glass
is
supposed
to
hold
about
1000
ml
of
liquid
still
it
could
not
contain
that
head
huge
had
to
stop
let
it
settle
then
pour
again
ever
so
carefully
when
the
final
drop
falls
out
of
the
bottle
im
left
with
a
not
quite
brown
somewhat
orange
nectar
with
a
head
three
fingers
thick
and
creamy
when
held
very
close
to
a
light
the
beer
is
a
hazy
orange
and
i
can
see
little
bits
of
yeast
floating
around
oh
i
poured
the
yeast
in
smell
is
raw
malts
bread
honey
alcohol
and
some
floral
hops
very
faint
floral
hops
taste
immediately
starts
out
sweet
honey
and
bread
the
sweetness
grows
as
the
honey
becomes
more
pronounced
and
the
bread
changes
to
almost
a
pudding
flavour
bread
pudding
ive
had
bread
pudding
once
a
long
time
ago
this
flavour
reminds
me
faintly
of
it
aftertaste
is
sweet
with
a
mild
bitter
zing
throughout
this
flavourful
experience
the
hops
are
their
in
the
background
adding
just
a
mild
balance
for
a
terrific
beer
mouthfeel
is
excellent
cannot
be
improved
its
creamy
thick
coats
the
tongue
mouth
and
throat
and
yes
has
a
light
carbonation
that
teases
the
senses
highly
drinkable
i
can
sip
this
for
hours
in
fact
thats
what
im
doing
now
poured
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
3
inch
creamy
head
that
dissapated
quickly
nose
is
of
fermented
fruits
taste
starts
off
with
a
blast
of
double
fermented
malts
and
finshes
with
a
slight
subtle
hop
the
whole
trip
is
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
is
very
fulfilling
and
is
also
lively
enough
to
keep
things
very
interesting
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
head
is
almost
tan
but
not
quite
starts
out
big
and
full
and
dies
way
to
quick
smell
is
fruity
with
a
nice
yeast
kick
at
the
end
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
taste
everything
was
there
but
nothing
really
grabs
me
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
dry
one
bottle
is
plenty
for
me
there
is
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
ive
certainly
enjoyed
many
bottles
but
there
is
something
lacking
in
the
flavor
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
like
it
good
body
to
this
one
somewhat
chewy
a
good
dark
beer
for
a
winters
day
this
beer
pours
an
orange
brown
with
a
small
quickly
receding
head
leaves
decent
lace
aroma
is
mild
floral
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
very
smooth
a
bit
thin
minimal
bitterness
nice
belgian
yeast
character
alcohol
subtle
overall
a
little
thin
but
i
had
this
after
the
blue
9
quite
nice
i
could
and
will
drink
lots
more
of
this
moving
on
to
the
blue
and
cream
labels
later
the
smell
is
of
dark
malts
caramel
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
brought
more
of
this
with
some
amount
degree
of
esters
as
well
its
a
well
blended
and
balanced
brew
although
its
lacking
the
complexion
found
in
some
of
the
competition
reddish
brown
pour
dense
thick
head
very
small
bubbles
that
lace
well
slightly
fruity
musty
smell
smooth
and
creamy
start
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
good
dubble
but
not
great
flavor
is
a
bit
too
subdued
compared
to
other
examples
of
this
style
this
has
a
light
hint
of
carmel
flavor
and
is
just
delicious
rather
expensive
but
worth
the
money
you
will
love
drining
this
beer
for
its
taste
and
nouthfeel
you
will
appreciate
even
more
if
you
a
have
a
couple
domestics
lights
before
sampling
this
one
not
my
favorite
stylebut
a
decent
brew
nonetheless
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
good
balance
of
carbonation
and
body
though
not
a
beer
id
have
all
the
time
its
not
something
id
hesitate
to
buy
again
a
better
beer
than
say
milwaukees
best
but
not
a
match
for
st
bernardus
or
even
allagash
drinkability
oh
its
easy
to
enjoy
and
rather
common
nowadays
id
usually
look
to
the
white
or
blue
but
the
red
is
a
good
intro
to
belgian
beers
and
is
easy
to
enjoy
as
with
all
imports
the
price
is
a
consideration
especially
with
more
interesting
items
to
pick
from
but
chimay
is
a
tasty
brand
and
one
that
keeps
its
products
rather
consistent
nice
beer
overall
i
personally
didnt
care
for
the
flavor
at
all
pear
and
champagne
i
really
dont
like
champagne
and
this
was
way
too
similar
for
me
it
was
pretty
well
made
and
did
get
a
little
better
as
it
warmed
but
i
was
already
tuned
into
the
flavors
i
didnt
care
for
pricy
but
definitely
worth
drinking
sparingly
unless
youve
got
a
sixfigure
salary
or
a
trust
fund
pick
one
up
every
once
in
a
while
savor
it
and
then
forget
it
exists
i
didnt
see
a
vintage
date
on
this
if
i
recall
the
bigger
bottles
have
it
on
their
cork
but
the
little
ones
lack
a
cork
the
beer
poured
a
clear
goldenamber
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
lasted
very
nicely
the
aroma
was
a
touch
wortymalty
with
some
slight
mustiness
and
a
touch
of
melon
and
spicy
vanilla
but
not
really
strong
i
expected
more
esters
for
the
style
and
complex
raisin
notes
but
the
aroma
was
nice
the
flavoer
was
superb
fully
malty
robust
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
as
well
as
some
toasted
bread
the
bitterness
was
not
dominant
and
was
easy
to
miss
meaning
it
blended
well
with
the
malty
profile
of
the
beer
also
the
alcohol
didnt
dominate
either
and
was
almost
not
noticable
this
one
could
get
very
dangerous
very
fast
wonderful
now
for
something
else
a
bruindubbel
apearance
good
but
little
light
to
my
taste
and
not
completely
clear
smell
hops
and
some
caramel
so
ok
taste
gets
more
sweet
while
i
drink
the
033
l
bottle
but
doesnt
get
over
the
sweet
edge
that
with
some
caremelmalty
taste
in
it
makes
it
in
my
eyes
a
good
bruin
beer
monstrous
foamy
chimay
head
that
diminished
well
but
left
behind
a
thick
cottony
lacing
sweet
floral
and
yeasty
fragrance
also
aromas
of
stone
fruit
bubble
gum
and
cotton
candy
flavors
of
citrus
and
candysugar
alcohol
is
noticeable
lively
champagnelike
mouthfeel
but
mediumbodied
and
silky
smooth
very
nice
pours
a
medium
reddish
brown
with
a
large
slightly
off
white
head
that
lasted
a
good
while
smell
is
fruity
with
a
touch
of
white
pepper
sharpness
and
what
seemed
to
be
just
a
touch
of
camphor
taste
is
malty
and
fruity
strong
at
the
beginning
the
spicyness
seems
to
come
in
just
when
the
beer
might
seem
to
be
getting
too
sweet
some
tartness
at
the
end
but
not
a
lot
over
all
a
steady
offering
i
would
drink
it
again
but
at
the
price
i
might
choose
something
with
a
bit
more
personality
though
i
prefer
the
chimay
cinq
cents
best
of
the
line
i
do
try
to
get
in
a
few
reserves
and
grand
reserves
a
year
when
i
first
tried
it
about
12
years
ago
i
found
it
shocking
and
nearly
undrinkable
now
its
just
one
of
a
number
of
trappist
and
abbey
beers
i
drink
regularly
and
though
its
not
the
most
interesting
one
out
there
its
still
a
classic
very
enjoyable
not
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
but
definitely
worth
a
try
the
heavy
alcohol
aromapresence
isnt
hidden
well
at
all
and
could
limit
the
amount
of
pints
consumed
otherwise

character
most
of
the
aromas
carried
through
into
the
flavour
with
much
less
spiciness
and
a
little
boost
to
maltiness
additionally
there
was
a
slight
alcohol
warming
the
fruitiness
was
reminiscent
of
plums
and
there
was
a
light
bitterness
providing
some
balance
the
finish
was
more
malty
with
little
bitterness
coming
through
mediumhigh
carbonation
adds
to
the
medium
body
to
produce
a
very
smooth
texture
all
in
all
it
seems
like
a
very
good
beer
for
one
of
my
early
ventures
into
the
style
this
is
a
cloudy
dark
amber
brown
ale
with
a
small
beige
head
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
a
spicey
hop
characteristic
the
fruity
sweetness
tantilizes
the
tip
of
your
tongue
at
first
then
a
smooth
spicey
hop
presence
perculates
on
the
middle
of
your
tongue
and
the
finish
leaves
a
great
tasty
coating
in
your
mouth
boom
i
popped
the
cork
and
poured
this
garnet
or
darker
wheres
my
home
depot
color
match
liquid
there
was
little
head
formation
but
the
aroma
of
candied
sugar
and
raisins
was
enticing
the
brew
was
light
bodied
and
well
tempered
as
dubbels
go
it
seemed
mild
but
employed
a
palate
of
flavors
to
create
subtle
and
shifting
moods
the
sugars
and
raisons
were
the
dominate
flavors
but
some
hints
of
banana
and
maybe
even
close
made
their
way
into
the
flavors
each
taste
seemed
slightly
different
but
always
enjoyable
this
beer
is
much
of
what
i
expected
very
flavorful
and
complex
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
blue
and
tripel
ales
pours
a
redish
brown
with
a
off
white
headthat
doesnt
last
long
aroma
is
good
sweet
fruity
and
malty
with
light
wiff
of

tastes
is
malty
with
light
fruit
flavor
and
light
yeasty
bread
flavors
followed
by
lightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
drinkability
is
good
but
honestly
for
the
price
you
can
get
so
many
better
beers
i
know
lots
of
people
think
highly
of
chimay
but
i
fail
to
see
why
still
have
the
blue
to
go
hopefully
it
will
live
up
to
the
hype
the
only
improvements
that
could
be
made
to
this
beer
would
be
to
make
it
a
little
less
carbonated
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dry
other
than
that
a
topnotch
beer
that
was
very
enjoyable
cant
wait
to
try
the
chimay
blue
drinkability
good
i
could
go
through
a
bottle
or
2
in
a
night
aged
for
two
years
a
bottle
of
this
beer
takes
on
an
even
better
aroma
which
is
hard
to
believe
now
strong
pineapple
aromas
strong
meat
smells
not
the
roasted
aromas
of
a
burnt
malt
such
as
in
a
stout
or
porter
but
a
much
cleaner
spiced
meat
smell
i
cannot
get
enough
of
the
aromathere
are
so
many
nuances
massively
strong
fresh
breadyeast
notes
dominate
nuts
pine
woodit
goes
on
and
on
ageing
has
also
created
a
smoother
mouthfeel
with
more
phenolic
warmth
upon
my
word
you
have
not
truly
tasted
this
beer
until
you
have
aged
it
for
a
few
years
this
makes
me
want
to
go
out
and
buy
12
of
these
and
cellar
them
to
save
for
very
special
occasions
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
reddish
caramel
color
with
a
large
off
white
head
the
smell
is
fruit
and
yeast
reminds
me
of
red
wine
the
taste
is
good
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
was
expecting
something
more
complex
i
tasted
a
nice
cider
and
wine
taste
along
with
yeast
hop
flavor
was
almost
non
existent
this
beer
is
smooth
and
the
carbonation
is
good
this
beer
is
absolutely
better
than
most
but
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
price
it
commands
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
it
do
so
patience
is
key
grasshopper
at
first
this
beer
comes
off
as
a
bit
overspiced
and
too
upfront
however
as
it
warms
and
decants
it
really
reveals
itself
and
provides
layer
upon
layer
of
unique
flavors
this
is
a
beer
to
savor
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
otherwise
i
think
much
of
what
it
offers
is
lost
complex
and
rewarding
for
those
with
the
time
and
selfcontrol
to
do
it
right
excellent
beer
here
enough
said
the
appearance
and
aroma
were
a
perfect
example
of
a
belgian
abbey
nice
thick
head
that
remained
until
the
last
wonderful
sip
the
only
way
to
enjoy
one
of
these
is
with
the
silver
tipped
chimay
chalice
i
am
very
excited
because
i
had
this
at
a
new
barclub
so
they
may
have
just
found
my
weakness
for
their
business
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
very
drinkable
pours
a
murky
cola
brown
under
a
reddish
brown
two
finger
head
that
settle
a
bit
too
quickly
lacks
contour
and
leaves
no
lace
the
nose
is
mild
with
a
hint
of
sweet
fruit
raspberry
and
yeast
the
mouth
is
light
and
quite
prickly
the
taste
is
disappointingly
thin
theres
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
and
a
healthy
portion
of
yeast
but
little
else
and
nothing
particularly
noteworthy
theres
a
touch
of
hops
once
it
starts
to
warm
but
this
is
remarkably
bland
for
the
style
its
not
bad
but
compared
to
its
siblings
and
cousins
this
is
definitely
a
weak
sister

this
is

the

meant
to

savored
like
a
fine

wine
those
monks
know
what
theyre
doing
id
call
this
a
dinner
beer
it
goes
better
with
food
than
just
about
anything
ive
had
it
even
went
well
with
chilidogs
theres
something
about
that
initial
sweetness
and
food
that
made
me
savor
every
sip
and
bite
the
finish
is
drying
with
a
bready
sweetness
and
herbal
after
taste
this
is
a
wonderful
ale
brewed
with
care
and
just
begging
to
be
served
with
a
rich
festive
dinner
i
like
to
buy
the
large
bottles
and
let
them
cellar
a
while
to
bring
up
some
more
complex
flavors
pretty
decent
beer
easy
enough

really
fun
drinking
this
one
out
of
the
proper

i
just
drank
four
pbrs
so
im

that
my

are

be

im
glad
i
tried

but
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
i
buy
it
again
split
a
750
of
this
with
a
friend
over
the
weekend
it
was
my
first
chimay
product
it
poured
a
deep
orangishbrown
color
with
a
billowing
white
head
into
my
guulden
draak
tulip
glass
smell
was
loaded
with
spice
taste
was
nice
but
not
overly
complex
hints
of
clove
complement
the
strong
yeast
character
of
this
trappist
mouthfeel
was
a
little
bit
thin
thus
it
didnt
pair
well
with
the
taste
drinkability
would
be
one
of
this
beers
strong
points
i
could
sip
on
these
all
night
notes
an
amazing
beer
this
is
a
good
example
of
how
monks
made
thier
reputations
the
apperance
of
this
is
almost
perfect
i
must
say
i
was
a
little
underwelmed
the
competition
is
very
tough
in
the
belgian
teritory
i
found
the
taste
really
hard
to
define
it
is
such
a
great
and
smooth
balance
of
all
the
ingredients
the
yeast
is
fairly
present
and
i
detected
some
citrus
aspects
grapefruit
lemon
and
oranges
the
lemon
gives
the
beer
a
refreshing
aspect
balanced
with
the
hops
hops
come
afterwards
but
in
a
very
natural
way
like
the
normal
following
of
the
malts
and
the
yeast
its
more
about
the
flower
and
fruit
aspect
of
the
hops
than
about
mere
bitterness
a
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
not
my
favorite
among
trappist
beers
but
stilla
very
good
brew
over
all
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
first
experience
with
this
brew
and
will
have
to
try
the
750
ml
next
and
then
on
tap
at
mahars
also
will
open
my
eye¬ís
to
try
some
of
the
other
offering
from
bi√®res
de
chimay
it
is
a
rust
brown
color
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
soft
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
fruity
with
some
bread
quality
to
it
it
is
malty
and
is
balanced
by
the
spicy
phenols
and
alcohol
there
is
a
slight
metallic
tinge
in
the
taste
as
well
it
finishes
drier
than
i
would
have
expected
for
such
a
malty
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
but
again
these
beers
are
so
infinitely
better
out
of
the
750ml
bottles
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
definately
a
good
beer
although
i
feel
i
may
not
be
experienced
enough
to
recognize
some
of
the
complexities
here
the
lack
of
a
definable
hop
presence
also
puts
me
back
a
little
but
i
feel
i
could
grow
to
enjoy
the
style
in
time
a
solid
dubbel
not
really
up
to
par
with
the
smaller
trappists
an
excellent
trappist
ale
among
belgiums
finest
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
support
these
nice
monks
on
a
more
regular
basis
its
easy
to
forget
how
good
a
beer
is
when
you
havent
had
one
for
a
while
the
chimay
red
pours
a
brown
to
ruby
red
with
a
clean
white
head
and
some
lasting
lacing
it
has
a
crisp
aroma
with
hints
of
the
malt
and
clove
as
well
as
some
alcohol
accent
the
taste
is
simply
great
this
in
my
opinion
is
one
of
the
best
beers
made
it
has
a
multiplicity
of
taste
that
is
hard
to
find
in
other
beers
although
it
is
a
classic
abbey
beer
the
strongest
taste
is
of
malt
a
little
smoky
but
not
like
a
porter
or
stout
there
is
a
hint
of
clove
and
carob
but
just
a
hint
there
is
a
fruitiness
that
reminds
me
of
grapes
and
that
back
of
the
mouth
bitterness
of
hops
this
feels
great
in
the
nose
in
the
mouth
and
going
down
this
may
be
addicting
pours
a
rubygolden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
and
spicy
notes
and
a
yeasty
character
tickles
the
nose
very
sweet
smooth
taste
but
a
little
watery
in
the
feel
the
body
is
lacking
that
kick
spices
and
herbs
are
very
present
mainly
ginger
comes
to
mind
tastes
a
bit
of
candied
sugars
nice
sweet
aftertaste
but
its
missing
something
still
a
quality
brew
the
aftertaste
is
also
a
little
sour
but
otherwise
this
is
a
great
beer

overall
i
was
unpleasantly
surprised
after
all
the
good
things
i
had
read
about
chimay
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
trappists
that
i
have
tried
so
far
a
very
good
beer
to
have
around
and
my
second
favorite
among
the
chimay
beers
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
malty
yet
very
spicey
scent
it
smells
like
there
are
some
crystal
malts
and
ginger
used
it
has
a
strong
rootbeer
type
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
is
light
with
a
watery
finish
it
has
a
decent
belgian
brown
flavor
to
it
it
is
smooth
going
down
there
is
no
sign
of
an
elevated
abv
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
well
an
excellent

beer
the
big
bubbly
khaki
head
leaves
a
little

that
seems
to

extremely

definitely
not
overly
sweet

an
excellent
beer
note
seems
to
be
what
many
other
brewers
are
striving
for
that
is
complexity
without
hitting
you
over
the
head
american
micros
should
pay
attention
poured
cloudy
brownorange
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
actually
had
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
peppery
floral
with
undertones
of
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
fizzy
from
the
carbonation
with
almost
a
nettley
feel
on
the
palate
it
tasted
toasted
peppery
and
very
smooth
with
a
complete
lack
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
whole
brew
felt
regal
to
me
and
it
seemed
eminently
drinkable
very
pleasant
it
poured
a
wonderfully
cloudy
amber
with
a
thumbswidth
of
tan
head
it
had
a
very
fruity
smell
the
taste
is
a
strong
yeast
which
should
be
expected
from
a
sustaining
beer
such
as
this
a
very
satisfying
taste
it
mixed
well
with
cheese
and
bread
it
should
be
excellent
with
a
meal
or
as
a
meal
the
feel
was
superbly
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
an
oily
finish
this
beer
is

drinkable

this
chimay
poured
a
deep
red
with
a
good
head
that
lasted
till
the
last
sip
the
lacing
was
moderate
the
smell
was
of
a
very
spicy
and
fruity
nature
the
taste
was
inline
with
the
smell
a
slight
spice
to
it
with
a
fruity
almost
pear
like
taste
a
malt
flavor
was
also
present
but
much
less
than
the
other
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
moderate
and
very
nice
cheers
life
is
good
my
friends
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
my
first
chimay
it
isnt
as
good
as
expected
but
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
high
its
a
good
beer
and
ill
probably
drink
it
again
that
said
its
far
from
a
favorite
a
good
beer
above
average
mouthfeel
easy
finish
the
chimay
red
really
was
a
good
introduction
to
the
trappist
style
ill
be
sampling
more
drinkability
good
stuff
i
prefer
chimay
blue
very
good
no
evidence
of
alcohol
to
the
nose
or
taste
as
for
the
taste
although
it
is
very
nice
it
is
a
dryer
representation
of
its
sisters
where
the
basic
elements
of
wheatyness
hoppyness
and
maltyness
are
present
but
the
taste
fades
from
the
embracing
sweetness
of
the
others
to
a
stronger
bitter
feel
that
although
very
nice
doesnt
topple
my
bias
towards
grande
reserve
crown
capped
this
is
minimum
4
cork
is
between
3
and

5
maybe
its
just
me
but
the
red
just
isnt
condusive
to
a
cork
the
blue
gets
away
with
it
far
better
three
and
a
half
years
after
my
first
bottle
and
it
is
a
staple
when
i
take
a
nice
corked
750
ml
to
a
party
molasses
and
creaminess
in
the
yeast
keeps
on
drinkablity
well
that
was
pretty
good
at
7abv
the
alcohol
content
doesn¬ít
come
through
to
much
until
near
the
finish
a
complex
brew
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
ale
sadly
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
tangy
for
me
sampled
102303
a
decent
dubbel
but
i
think
there
are
better
out
there
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
setting
especially
if
with
dinner
a
bit
surprising
for
the
7
alcohol
otherwise
great
stuff
this
beer
is
amber
in
color
emphasis
is
on
red
with
a
reasonable
sized
tan
head
starts
somewhat
murky
but
progresses
further
as
more
and
more
yeast
is
poured
the
smell
is
rather
tame
for
a
belgian
abbey
style
beer
fruity
with
a
slight
nutty
aroma
are
noticed
in
the
smell
tastes
rather
malty
with
a
decent
hop
bitterness
this
beer
is
not
as
fruity
or
as
big
as
the
blue
label
malty
and
somewhat
spicy
subdued
fruit
flavors
particularly
banana
and
citrus
fruit
quite
crisp
and
very
drinkable
pourred
a
copperish
brew
with
a
nice
big
head
the
head
stayed
on
top
for
a
long
time
very
complex
spice
with
a
not
too
distinct
alcohol
taste
i
would
describe
the
taste
as
sweet
with
a
light
bitterness
aftertaste
very
firm
body
this
is
classic
and
can
never
get
enough
of
this
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
touch
of
fruits
soon
after
i
pick
up
a
nice
citrus
bite
followed
by
some
spices
there
is
a
lot
more
to
this
than
the
white
deep
malt
flavors
provide
a
solid
backround
for
the
finish
which
gives
way
to
a
nice
spicy
aftertaste
delicious
fruity
burps
really
add
a
nice
touch
i
picked
up
on
some
metallic
flavors
about
half
way
through
but
it
was
only
for
a
sip
or
two
wierd
this
is
a
pretty
good
drinking
belgian
i
think
the
blue
reserve
is
by
far
the
best
from
these
guys
but
you
should
give
this
one
a
whirl
quite
a
nice
brew
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
smaller
head
than
i
would
have
liked
but
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
yeast
sediments
flow
freely
throughout
my
glass
i
smell
lots
of
sweetness
and
some
other
nondescript
flavors
the
initial
taste
reminds
me
of
some
sweet
candy
ive
had
before
not
sure
what
though
as
i
continue
more
flavors
show
a
complex
mix
of
bready
yeast
and
spices
create
wonderful
complexity
deeper
malts
also
come
through
maybe
caramel
quite
nice
not
extremely
complex
but
still
was
a
great
multidimensioned
brew
its
very
warming
but
not
treacly
like
a
lot
of
other
highalcohol
beers
its
7
it
does
have
a
fruity
aftertaste
and
goes
down
very
easily
i
could
drink
about
3
of
these
before
i
wanted
something
lighter
or
fall
asleep
im
not
sure
its
a
beer
to
accompany
a
meal
it
is
almost
food
in
itself
i
always
drank
blond
beers
when
i
was
eating
red
meat
or
mussels
in
belgium
i
never
really
considered
trying
a
heavy
beer
with
food
the
macro
of
the
trappist
ales
if
thats
possible
anyway
appearance
deep
amber
brown
with
an
fluffy
creamy
textured
tan
colored
head
very
nice
retention
lacing
is
trademark
belgian
lacing
tiny
webbed
even
patterns
aroma
mild
fruit
tones
of
apple
and
raisin
variety
are
evident
a
bit
of
a
musty
breadiness
their
im
guessing
product
of
the
yeast
and
a
mellow
malt
profile
is
here
with
hops
blended
into
the
harmonious
mix
taste
this
one
by
far
when
compared
to
other
belgian
ales
lacks
in
comparison
most
of
the
time
flavor
has
a
musty
finish
the
fruit
isnt
quite
as
apparent
as
in
the
aromatics
flavors
seem
dull
here
not
as
much
of
an
orgy
of
flavor
as
i
would
like
to
occur
there
is
however
a
breadiness
mixed
within
the
flavor
some
bittering
hops
here
in
the
finish
but
overall
overrated
on
reputation
alone
in
my
book
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
creamy
texture
nice
no
complaints
and
not
too
much
praise
drinability
yeah
its
clean
and
finishes
nicely
but
hand
me
a
bier
from
brewery
ommegang
anyday
before
chimay
red
premiere
poured
very
dark
fruity
hop
aroma
mildly
hop
fruit
taste
hard
to
distinguish
what
kind
of
fruit
alittle
carmel
sweet
in
the
middleand
seemed
to
get
sweeter
as
it
went
along
the
strenght
of
this
brew
sneaks
up
on
you
glob
of
foam
stays
on
top
till
the
end
poured
a
dark
brown
with
offwhite
head
smells
of
yeast
rich
malt
fruit
and
rum
tast
is
malty
and
evenly
spicy
hint
of
white
pepper
i
think
the
mouth
is
very
full
and
the
beer
is
very
filling
to
drink
dinner
in
a
bottle
this
was
my
first
chimay
and
part
1
of
a
3
part
vertical
chimay
tasting
this
beer
pours
a
brown
slightly
reddish
color
with
about
half
an
inch
of
white
head
or
so
the
carbonation
can
be
seen
from
the
constant
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
has
a
fruity
smell
of
plums
and
raisins
and
a
nice
malty
smell
the
first
taste
is
that
of
sweetness
like
caramel
and
then
it
goes
into
the
fruity
taste
the
malt
a
slight
alcohol
taste
is
also
pleasant
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
pleasing
to
the
mouth
it
has
a
heavy
mouthfeel
that
tells
you
this
is
not
your
run
of
the
mill
beer
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
brew
at
home
with
the
proper
glassware
this
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
find
and
it
will
cost
you
a
few
dollars
more
then
the
average
beer
but
it
is
well
worth
the
expense
pours
out
a
thick
and
luscious
dark
copper
amd
amber
colour
some
sediment
and
other
floaties
milling
around
a
rather
large
and
fizzy
head
appears
and
reduces
rather
quickly
stiff
musty
aroma
dark
ripened
fruits
and
yeast
somewhat
winey
in
nature
tastes
and
flavours
are
rather
subdued
malt
flavours
are
of
the
caramel
nature
with
slight
wooden
notes
followed
by
lots
of
ripened
fruits
i
like
the
flavour
and
its
quite
appealing
mouthfeel
is
best
described
as
full
and
rich
with
a
light
carbonation
that
produces
a
certain
crispness
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
more
tongue
tingling
rather
than
silky
smooth
absolutely
no
hint
of
the
7
abv
highly
drinkable
but
i
was
a
bit
letdown
by
the
overall
impression
of
this
abbey
dubbel
im
guessing
the
bottle
was
a
little
past
its
prime
although
my
limited
experience
with
belgians
tells
me
i
might
have
to
resample
this
again
which
i
will
gladly
oblige
an
enjoyable
brew
if
not
quite
as
enjoyable
as
a
westvleteren
nice
malt
back
with
the
plummy
raisiny
taste
from
the
candy
sugars
slight
alcohol
taste
but
nothing
overpowering
a
good
version
of
the
style
and
one
i
will
order
again
if
i
see
it
at
a
bar
for
home
consumption
i
will
buy
the
westlveteren
over
this
but
still
a
good
beer
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
white
head
your
typical
dubbel
sweet
a
spicy
nose
mediumbodied
but
with
a
very
sharp
carbonation
thats
slightly
distracting
and
not
really
pleasant
only
mildly
fruity
with
figs
and
plums
mild
on
the
hops
malt
is
also
present
but
only
in
the
background
overall
fairly
spicy
this
is
a
fairly
good
dubbel
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
ahh
a
nice

a
nice
medium
brown
with
a
slight

tint
with
a
huge

incrdible

is
fruity
and
slightly
smokey
the
flavor
starts
out
a
little
smokey
but
it
semmed
to
get
a
little
watery
in
the
middle
ending
with
a
nice
maltybready
flavor
lingering
a
very
nice
looking
beer
and
tastes
pretty
good
but
would
have
liked
a

this
beer
poured
a
medium

with
fine
sized
bubbles
yes
the
nose
did
remind
me
of
vomit
the
body

hue
was

of

the

that
i

in
no

drink
from
again
anytime
soon
not

not

lacks

still
highly
drinkable
for
the

overall
impression
its
worth
investing
in
some
glassware
for
this
i
own
a
chimay
goblet
called
a
gourmet
that
i
use
for
heavier
beers
with
the
gold
leaf
rim
its
about
5
but
if
you
are
serious
about
beer
pony
up
the
dough
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
drinkability
the
one
hefty
sized
bottle
has
me
feeling
quite
friendly
but
id
gladly
tackle
another
if
it
were
offered
this
is
an
abbey
beer
folks
a
little
slice
of
history
carefully
put
in
a
bottle
just
for
you
as
ben
franklin
said
beer
is
proof
there
is
a
god
and
he
wants
us
to
be
happy
i
think
the
monks
agree
red
brown
opaque

very

and
very
easy

mediumlight

and
amazing
easy
to
drink
where
the
other
chimay
beers
are
shooting
for
finess
over
intensity
i
believe
this
one
achieves
it
looking
at
this
beer
in
my
glass
reminds
me
of
the
charles
river
in
boston
from
the
swampy
color
to
the
tan
foamy
head
aroma
is
complex
fruity
malty
with
a
slight
floral
presence
crisp
and
effercescent
yet
smooth
and
medium
to
full
bodied
with
an
ever
so
slight
metallic
finish
very
drinkable
especially
at
55
degrees
good
sample
of
a
good
belgian
abbaye
what
is
really
nice
about
this
beer
is
how
well
balanced
it
is
its
never
overpowering
or
overwhelming
but
each
flavors
has
its
own
spot
and
compliments
the
other
flavors
a
very
nice

very

this
subsides

sticks

also

taste

it

would

this
would

very
nicely

game
meat
im
looking

to
trying
it

this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
hints
of
red
around
the
edges
it
has
a
minimal

the
alcohol
is
vaguely
apparent
but
just
to
the
point
that
it
adds
character
to
the

i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
as
well
as
the

aside
chimay
is
a
good
belgian
beer
but
there
are
many
others
that
are
far
better
its
a
light
amber
color
with
a
huge
head
of
white
frothiness
i
had
a
very
stuffy
nose
during
this
review
damn
spring
allergies
so
all
i
got
out
of
the
aroma
was
some
yeast
and
sweetness
the
flavors
were
easy
to
pick
up
though
dark
fruits
start
and
finish
with
some
yeast
character
in
between
very
enjoyable
i
had
to
pay
8
for
a
750ml
bottle
pretty
steep
to
me
id
rather
get
the
chimay
blue
for
that
matter
its
much
more
complex
and
rewarding
but
this
is
a
great
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
little
less
acohol
and
complexity
drinkable
certainly
but
like
the
other
chimays
a
bit
pricey
for
everyday
consumption
pours
a
slightly
hazed
raison
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
there
is
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
at
first
but
then
you
notice
the
fruit
and
spices
as
well
in
the
aromas
this
smells
great
at
first
taste
you
sense
the
hops
sliding
into
the
fruit
maybe
raisonlike
with
light
spicing
and
a
hint
of
yeast
this
well
blended
beer
is
medium
to
light
bodied
and
finishes
with
a
dry
spice
finish
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
would
pair

a
mild
hop
crispness
deliver
a
relatively
drinkable
brew
even
with
the
complexity
and
higher
abv
this
beer
gave
me
high
hopes
from
the
first
pour
and
it
did
not
let
down
the
color
is
a
deep
and
hazy
red
with
just
a
touch
of
brown
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
slowly
dissipated
to
a
wonderful
lace
that
remained
throughout
the
smell
was
very
spicy
with
a
fruit
dominantly
apple
background
the
spices
and
malt
character
blended
together
with
just
a
touch
of
yeast
and
hop
flavors
to
make
a
wonderfully
smooth
and
tasty
beer
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
having
it
again
apples
that
was
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
when
i
smelled
this
beer
it
tasted
fruity
and
a
little
tart
which
may
be
why
i
initially
thought
apple
instead
of
any
other
fruit
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
given
its
alcohol
content
mediumsized
head
that
settled
rather
quickly
deep
red
hue
great
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
though
at
9
a
bottle
on
my
college
budget
it
will
have
to
be
for
special
occasions
only
a
pretty
beer
when
poured
in
a
glass
and
the
aroma
of
fruits
was
a
pleasure
the
thick
head
was
probably
more
due
to
my
error
in
pouring
but
still
lovely
nonetheless
the
first
sip
was
fruity
and
slightly
hopped
but
very
smooth
i
was
happy
the
entire
glass
except
when
it
was
empty
the
overall
flavor
did
subside
some
with
each
sip
as
my
tongue
got
desensitized
to
the
bouquet
of
flavors
i
am
still
working
on
my
ability
to
properly
describe
what
i
am
tasting
in
beer
lingo
but
this
might
work
too
yummy
i
havent
had
red
in
quite
awhile
and
i
was
suprised
as
to
how
mellow
this
beer
is
compared
to
the
many
stronger
styles
ive
had
since
this
tastes
almost
like
an
english
ale
fullers
or
a
doppelbocksalvator
as
much
it
does
a
belgian
dubble
nice
wineylike
malt
smoothness
and
creaminess
some
spice
but
not
too
much
possibly
the
least
sweet
belgian
trappist
or
abbey
ive
had
head
disappeared
quickly
one
of
the
least
impressive
appearances
ive
seen
in
a
belgian
or
belgianstyled
beer
almost
no
lacing
on
the
other
hand
considering
the
stillpotent
abv
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
ale
nice
taste
nothing
to
put
you
off
high
quality
but
real
subtle
for
a
trappist
a
hazy
brown
colored
beer
slight
amber
in
when
backlit
small
tan
head
that
depleted
fast
the
aroma
was
figgy
fruity
and
spicy
yeast
the
taste
was
much
better
than
the
aroma
and
appearance
it
was
spicy
and
hoppy
with
a
soothing
malt
character
fig
or
grape
fruity
taste
it
was
very
light
body
with
a
light
and
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
very
easy
to
down
a
few
i
am
sure
the
lacing
was
great
just
as
i
expected
and
it
left
some
dazzling
rings
in
the
glass
sweet
raw
honeylike
malt
aroma
and
flavour
some
herbal
medicinal
flavour
clash
with
a
fresh
tasting
juicy
hops
ripe
tropical
fruit
is
vague
but
present
a
hell
of
a
lot
sweet
than
what
i
am
used
in
the
bottle
i
actually
prefer
the
bottle
but
would
certainly
order
this
again
aroma
had
an
original
quick
shot
of
raisin
like
fruitiness
then
moved
to
a
strong
phenol
and
cloves
nose
big
and
full
head
with
a
cloudy
orange
amber
color
with
obvious
sediment
minimal
lacing
ale
smoothness
alcohol
taste
notable
cloves
and
phenol
again
with
fruity
background
great
long
lasting
finish
of
both
flavor
and
dryness
lower
carbonation
which
helps
the
smoothness
mostly
an
enjoyable
adventure
of
flavors
but
a
bit
limited
others
have
described
it
well
and
better
than
i
my
bottle
may
have
been
a
little
old
because
it
lacked
the
complexity
as
i
would
have
liked
enjoyable
nonetheless
this
is
quite
a
wonderful
brew
pours
a
cloudy
orangebrown
color
has
a
rich
creamy
head
which
leaves
a
lace
that
clings
to
the
glass
for
the
entire
duration
wonderful
malt
aromas
emerged
with
a
spicy
hint
of
cloves
and
sweet
citrus
the
carbonation
seemed
to
dance
on
my
tongue
like
that
of
fine
champagne
this
brew
has
an
exceptionally
wellbalanced
taste
of
plums
raisins
and
touch
of
pepperlike
spiciness
this
is
a
wonderfully
complex
yet
balanced
beer
it¬ís
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
three
chimay¬ís
this
is
a
very
good
beer
although
i
put
it
last
among
the
three
chmays
however
thats
definitely
not
a
bad
thing
because
all
three
are
great
well
a
another
high
rated
beer
but
not
for
me
it
has
a
bit
too
high
alcohol
content
for
me
and
it
has
an
aroma
and
flavor
like
all
strong
belgian
ales
the
yeast
overpowers
as
is
typical
for
these
belgian
types
dont
really
care
for
this
one
pours
a
nice
red
almost
garnet
in
color
a
thick
off
white
head
that
wouldn¬ít
quit
slowly
gave
way
to
a
thick
neverending
lace
that
was
on
there
until
the
finish
mostly
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
plums
or
raisins
mixed
with
yeast
nice
very
nice
a
malt
sweetness
moves
over
your
tongue
with
the
hints
of
plum
raisins
and
yeast
very
smooth
and
creamy
feeling
in
your
mouth
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
so
don¬ít
let
the
rating
fool
you
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
i
like
to
leave
room
for
adjustments
where
needed
looking
forward
to
many
more
beers
of
this
style¬Öi
may
need
to
change
my
profile
this
beer
comes
across
much
better
in
my
memory
as
it
seems
much
less
flavorful
and
complex
as
other
examples
from
years
past
is
this
brew
being
dumbed
down
disappointing

being
a
belgain
weekend
i
had
to
try
this
beer
again
i
was
a
little
dissappointed
not
as
biting
or
outstanding
as
i
remembered
a
little
week
although
it
did
have
a
good
taste
to
it
i
find
myself
leaning
towards
the
north
american
belgians
such
as
allagash
unibrue
and
ommegang

a

ive
never
tried
this
beer
before

am
drinking
has
been
cellared
for
6
months
i
love
it
not
as
intense
wild

that
i
associate
with
belgians

very
complex

have
been

along

they
did

the

an
amber

brew
fills
the

and
a
very
large
offwhite
head
forms
on
top
stays
very
well
with
the
help
of
the
chimay
chalices
etched
bottom
which
creates
bubbles
that
rise
to
the
top
keeping
the
head
perfect

a

dots

as
it
levels
out
beautiful
spicy
aroma
dried
plum
and
raisin
dominate
along
with
a
little
yeast
in
the
background
maybe
a
bit
of
banana
as
well
definitely
a
dubbel
aroma
theres
a
characteristic
in
there
that
i
cant
quite
pinpoint
its
almost
like
a
soft
aged
cheese
aroma
maybe
a
little
bready
a
slight
belgian
pepper
tingle
greets
the
tongue
with
the
first
taste
clove
and
a
bit
of
banana
follow
rich
yet
delicate
malt
sweetness
supports
the
fruity
and
spicy
products
of
the
yeast
as
the
liquid
travels
around
your
palate
it
feels
almost
thick
like
whipped
cream
so
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
just
about
the
smoothest
creamiest
beer
ive
ever
tasted
or
felt
if
you
will
a
medium
to
light
body
but
the
complexities
and
malt
make
this
a
pleasure
to
savor
in
the
way
that
a
more
fullbodied
beer
would
be
i
can
definitely
see
this
one
holding
the
monks
over
during
a
fasting
a
delight
to
the
senses
another
musttry
from
chimay
dark
brown
color
which
is
actually
very
attractive
if
you
pay
attention
to
it

with
a
creamy
thick

has
a
light
smell
of
apricot

beer
by

style
pours
a
nice
deep
reddish
copper
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
white
head
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
with
hints
of
apricot
and
figs
i
also
read
another
reviewer
describe
this
aroma
as
¬ìbread
pudding¬î
like
which
i
have
to
say
is
right
on
this
is
a
mediumbodied
brew
with
a
somewhat
complex
taste
that
is
a
bit
fruity
and
malty
with
a
dash
of
pepper
the
fine
carbonation
creates
a
very
nice
mouth
feel
that
goes
down
extremely
smoothly
i
could
drink
several
of
these
a
very
fine
beer
the
least
favorite
of
the
3
chimays
for
me
but
that
said
it
is
still
a
highly
credible
classic
beer
honeycolored
with
a
frothy
rocky
creamcolored
headlarge
bubbles
its
unfiltered
and
there
is
some
visible
particulate
matter
suspended
in
the
beer
but
not
so
much
as
to
be
bothersome
very
naturallooking
aroma
is
of
dark
fruity
maltiness
very
ripe
apples
or
apricotssmells
very
sweet
vigorous
carbonation
lends
a
very
crisp
bite
at
first
notes
of
clove
on
the
tongue
the
taste
is
somewhat
less
complex
than
the
smell
and
its
definitely
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
leads
one
to
expectthe
balance
is
striking
and
it
benefits
from
not
being
real
sweet
and
syrupy
certainly
a
worldclass
belgian
pours
a
cloudy
deep
amber
color
with
a
generous
head

tons
of

aroma

body
with

rich
in

some
yeastiness
and
breadlike
taste
finishes
with
light
hops
that
balance
it
out
slightly
dry
with
a
light

easy
to
drink
but
slowly
enjoy
this
one
a
wonderful
belgian
ale
this
is
a
great
beer
it
pours
with
a
small
but
creamy
tan
head
and
is
a
nice
dark
reddishbrown
the
aroma
is
very
appealing
like
calling
you
to
taste
me
and
the
taste
is
so
smooth
not
very
hoppy
but
more
on
the
malty
side
imo
great
tingly
moutfeel
that
stays
with
you
and
contrary
to
somethings
i
read
as
to
drink
it
alone
i
had
it
with
a
fettucine
alfredo
and
it
went
great
with
it
my
wife
even
liked
it
and
she
is

that

it

semidry
with
a

lingers

it
may
appear
onesided
at

a
closer
examination
will
reveal
that
theres
much
more
going
on
thats
what
makes
this
beer
work
so
well
its
great
balance
and
finesse
the
flavors
and
aromas
dont
reach
out
and
grab
you
individually
but
rather
act
as
a
whole
which
gives
it
complexity
as
the
varied

are
slowly
revealed
at

that
races
to
34
of
an
inch
in
the
tulip
glass
bright
aroma
a
little
citrus
and
cantelope
mouthfeel
is
light
and
at
the
same
time
a
woodsy
leafy
cane
sugar
malty
flavor
is
pretty
evident
theres
a
lot
of
yeastiness
going
on
here
good
hop
bittering
but
at
the
same
time
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
complexity
and
a
little
more
fruit
to
the
overall
impression
still
obviously
a
respectable
brew
the
grande
reserve
appeals
to
me
more
its
got
added
depth
of
flavors
this
is
decent
at
best
leaves
alot
to
be
desired
pours
with
an
impressive
even
head
that
persists
longer
than
expected
effervescence
remains
in
the
dark
brownish
brew
which
intrigues
with
light
swirls
of
foam
below
the
head
aromas
are
smooth
though
rather
muted
until
the
beer
warms
a
bit
taste
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
wellbalanced
neither
overwhelmingly
sweet
nor
overwhelmingly
bitter
deliciously
drinkable
a
really
wonderful
beer
big
frothy
head
which
quickly
died
out
so
much
that
the
beer
looked
flat
smells
like
a
belgian
should
which
isnt
all
that
pleasant
but
it
tastes
very
good
my
personal
favorite
of
the
chimays
pours
a
bit
browner
than
ruby
nice
typical
belgian
head
nose
has
that
smell
thats
the
same
in
the
la
trappe
beers
its
like
the
taste
of
suger
in
the
raw
if
you
took
away
the
sweetness
maybe
its
from
the
sugar
they
use
to
start
fermentation
some
very
faint
citric
qualities
to
the
smell
with
some
other
vague
fruitiness
im
not
sure
how
many
people
here
have
done
this
or
have
this
weed
but
chew
on
the
bottom
end
of
a
stalk
of
y
grass
peel
away
the
secondary
leaves
and
chew
on
the
white
bottom
its
a
flavor
that
very
similar
to
one
of
those
in
this
beer
flavor
it
with
a
little
bit
of
red
grapes
minus
the
sweetness
with
the
faintest
hint
of
alcohol
and
youve
got
the
flavor
nailed
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
fuzzy
because
of
the
way
the
carbonation
is
okay
opening
this
was
akin
to
open
a
champagne
bottle
lovely
amber
color
with
nice
whitelight
tan
head
nice
taste
to
it
and
a
mouthfeel
that
most
macrobrews
brag
about
and
dont
even
come
close
or
actually
denegrate
i
love
it
but
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
pours
a
nice
shade
of
burgandy
with
a
bubbly
head
that
retains
nicely
very
sweet
candylike
aroma
with
yeasty
tones
evident
also
taste
is
nice
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
very
refiined
compared
to
some
of
the
other
belgians
ive
had
recently
like
scaldis
taste
consists
of
a
bready
yeastiness
subdued
sweet
tones
of
cotton
candy
and
slight
bitterness
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
one
of
the
more
easily
drinkable
belgians
ive
had
are
you
guys
kidding
some
of
the
reserved
reviews
of
this
beer
make
my
blood
boil
this
is
without
question
one
of
the
worlds
top
10
beers
and
everything
one
would
expect
from
a
trappist
big
intense
aromas
gorgeous
head
deep
and
rich
satisfying
flavours
if
you
dont
like
this
one
then
you
should
stick
to
you
coors
light
137
rougish
brown
complex
aroma
a
mix
of
spices
fruit
and
caramel
malt
this
beers
aroma
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
some
green
apples
and
bandaid
hints
this
is
a
smoothsipping
malty
dinner
beer
cloudy
and
yeasty
with
a
pleasant
vinegar
attack
round
cidery
fruity
middle
cleansing
appetizing
finish
the
yeast
is
the
highlight
and
balances
the
brew
perfectly
between
weighty
intensity
and
frothy
lipsmacking
refreshment
drink
this
beer
with
food
namely
meat
rack
of
lamb
would
be
ideal
but
this
beer
is
so
good
that
boston
chicken
would
probably
do
the
trick
poured
with
a
large
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
nice
offwhite
bead
nice
yeastyfruity
nose
very
effervescent
as
usual
with
a
lively
slightly
acidic
mouthfeel
drying
out
in
the
end
i
dunno
seems
to
me
that
this
once
had
a
bit
more
character
in
the
years
past
but
still
a
world
classic
brew
glad
its
become
widely
availiable
in
my
area
pours
with
a
small
light
tan
head
medium
brown
color
slightly
hazy
well
carbonated
smells
lightly
roasty
sweet
and
spicy
tastes
roasty
and
nutty
finishes
slightly
syrupy
some
fruity
yeastiness
throughout
medium
body
not
quite
as
good
as
the
white
in
my
opinion
this
is
my
first
time
drinking
this
out
of
the
11
2
oz
bottle
instead
of
the
large
bottle
dark
red
color
with
a
slight
haze
unless
you
pour
out
the
sediment
then
it
gets
quite
hazy
obviously
great
head
that
retains
well
mild
phenolic
aroma
with
a
hint
of
clove
followed
by
caramel
malt
notes
smooth
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
very
low
hop
bitterness
sweetness
dominates
at
first
and
is
then
followed
by
a
tad
of
caramel
malt
and
complex
peppery
belgian
yeasty
flavors
this
is
much
better
in
the
11
2
oz
bottle
this
is
easily
the
most
balanced
belgian
trappist
ale
ive
had
lots
of
flavors
but
it
wont
kick
your
ass
like
the
other
two
chimays
i
could
go
for
a
couple
more
of
these
the
more
subdued
of
the
chimays
still
fantastic
belgian
character
warm
yeasty
and
spicy
flavour
ive
never
had
a
problem
with
it
exceptional
chimay
red
was
the
first
chimay
i
ever
tried
it
is
my
favorite
of
the
line
beautfiul
reddishcopper
color
great
lacing
and
a
wonderful
taste
this
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
the
body
yields
a
head
that
is
initially
large
frothy
offwhite
mostly
diminishing
the
color
is
a
murky
dark
amber
dense
medium
body
the
aroma
is
moderately
malt
hoppy
and
lightly
yeasty
evident
are
complex
notes
of
maybe
banana
plum
peach
honey
clove
vanilla
licorice
and
cola
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
lightly
acidic
and
bitter
overall
a
excellent
brew
clearly
great
beer
by
any
standard
unique
in
taste
and
smell
subtle
sweetness
that
evens
out
into
a
smooth
and
rich
experience
strong
yeast
presence
becomes
even
better
as
it
warms
the
first
reaction
to
trying
this
was
wow
i
didnt
even
want
to
share
a
sip
with
the
wife
so
smooth
yet
very
complex
sweet
maltiness
fruit
ripe
plum
raisin
subtle
chocolate
full
luscious
body
although
not
as
complex
as
the
grand
reserve
or
cing
cents
its
still
one
of
the
better
and
most
drinkable
beers
out
of
belgium
very
mellow
and
smooth
as
dubbels
go
one
of
the
easier
to
drink
a
good
introductory
dubbel
for
someone
looking
to
try
the
style
i
have
seen
the
light
thank
god
for
these
monks
smooth
subtle
fruit
hints
tasty
what
more
could
you
ask
for
from
a
beer
notes
we
can
die
now
its
okay
drinking
this
beer
has
made
the
cylce
of
life
complete
pours
a
deep
clear
brown
with
a
slightly
ruddy
tint
to
it
the
head
barely
hangs
on
after
pouring
but
still
leaves
some
nice
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
true
to
form
with
nice
dark
fruit
and
deep
caramel
sweetness
a
little
hint
of
spices
and
a
little
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
even
bigger
than
the
aroma
and
full
of
all
the
aroma
characteristics
the
body
is
a
nice
weight
maybe
not
quite
as
full
feeling
as
others
but
great
all
the
same
with
just
a
little
hit
of
carbonation
on
the
finish
pours
dark
brown
leaving
a
great
lace
which
stayed
on
the
glass
throughout
the
drink
loved
the
rich
and
nutty
taste
as
it
paired
nice
with
a
large
slice
of
lasagna
awesome

itself

the

again

overall
id
get
this

myself
if
even
better
quads

strong
darks
werent
also
available
at
the

price
it
was
an
excellent
experience
though
and
i
cant
thank
my
wife
enough
for
buying
it
for
me
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
this
style
and
i
think
this
is
the
best
one
that
i
have
ever
had
and
that
to
me
says
all
i
need
to
know
great
brew
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
hard
to
beat
dubbel
that
is
generally
overlooked
very
complex
with
perfect
execution
and
consistently
good
world
class
to
be
revisited
with

the

overpowering
the
taste
in
places
the

seeming

occasionally
it
is
definitely
up
there
with
some
of

the

let

down

swears
by
maredsous
he
says
it
is
o
e
of
his
favorites
from
when
he
grew
up
in
belgium
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
became
even
more
enjoyable
as
it
came
up
in
temperature
as
it
warmed
i
found
the
flavor
improved
the
spice
came
out
and
the
sweet
finish
became
more
prominent
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer

its
a
decent
ale

not
as
sweet

i
was
expecting

for
the
alcohol
level
and
slightly
lacking
in
depth
of
flavour
i
think
this
might
help
to
give
me
a
hangover
in
the
morning
water
next
very
good
with
strong
belgian
dishes
like
stoemp
the
body
of
this
beer
is
soft
and
yet
its
full
without
heaviness
the
alcohol
is
sturdy
so
be
careful
because
it
drinks
so
easily
there
is
the
faintest
hint
of
smoke
in
the
finish
and
you
will
take
three
or
four
more
sips
before
your
are
sure
the
anise
on
this
is
spectacular
i
was
expecting
chocolate
and
when
i
realized
the
anise
lightly
permeating
the
drink
i
was
delighted
this
beer
is
like
a
gentle
breath
the
bready
quality
of
the
malt
increases
as
it
warms
and
this
is
one
fabulous
dubbel
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
this
on
tap
at
meadhall
in
cambridge
ma
i
wasnt
aware
that
it
was
made
by
duvel
but
after
learning
that
it
was
no
surprise
top
quality
dubbel
malty
strong
and
delicious
a
comforting
belgian
beer
not
overpowering
or
weak
a
good
measure
of
the
belgian
styles
a
welltodo
dubbel
for
style
wellbalanced
and
supple
booziness
is
kept
atbay
for
the
most
part
o
some
kind
of
licquor
beer
very
well
suited
for
winter
time
11
2
oz
bottle
into
porter
glass
caramel
color
with
1
head
nice
color
for
a
brown
ale
ok
smell
surprisingly
lemony
at
first
also
some
notes
of
cedar
much
better
with
a
sharp
cheese
than
a
mild
one
great
with
a
manchego
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
expect
dark
with
a
medium
head
nondescript
smell
strong
peat
taste
creamy
finish
in
the
mouth
starting
out
with
strong
malt
flavor
but
ending
up
with
with
a
nice
bitter
edge
definitely
as
you
would
expect
not
a
light
refreshing
summer
beer
but
very
good
on
a
cold
night
great
with
manchego
not
bad
o
initially
somewhat
unrefined
but
opened
up
as
it
warmed
it
was
probably
best
at
just
below
room
temperature
never
been
bowled
over
by
the
dubbel
style
and
this
was
no
exception
great
flavour
but
too
light
and
frothy
for
my
liking
also
take
into
consideration
the
temperature
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
more
it
warmed
up
take
it
out
of
the
fridge
a
decent
while
before
drinking
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
the
taste
roars
back
and
gains
back
my
confidence
in
this
beer
with
its
dark
fruit
dark
malts
and
sweet
character
but
there
is
this
kind
of
moderate
bitterness
that
sneaks
up
on
the
backside
resulting
in
a
fine
balance
by
far
one
of
the
top
dubbels
i
have
ever
had
mouthfeel
malty
feel
and
highly
carbonated
o
good
beer
defiantly
european
by
which
i
mean
they
are
not
trying
to
knock
your
head
off
with
a
bitter
kick
that
being
said
still
too
sweet
for
my
taste
this
beer
looks
good
smells
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
let
me
down
a
bit
to
be
sure
it
is
a
really
good
beer
but
i
maybe
expected
touch
more
complexity
coming
through
and
a
more
satisfying
mouthfeel
it
has
a
lot
of
flavour
but
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
rich
per
say
a
good
double
and
refreshing
but
there
are
better
examples
a
great
example
of
what
brown
malts
can
do
in
a
beer
without
needing
to
be
roasted
or
dark
i
like
the
brown
malts
paired
with
the
phenols
pleasant
beer
very
belgian
round
and
balanced
overall
the
aftertaste
kind
of
kills
this
for
me
it
just
doesnt
taste
that
nice
and
has
an
overt
tone
of
beer
i
realize
how
ridiculous
that
sounds
and
not
of
the
other
flavors
that
similar
darker
belgians
have
for
me
this
is
probably
my
favourite
of
the
three
in
this
gift
pack
give
it
a
try
o
nice
beer
its
like
a
light
porter
mellow
and
fresh
mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervescent
overall
i
like
this
beer
brew
tastes
good
has
full
body
and
had
the
looks
you
want
in
this
type
of
brew
this
is
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
o
strange
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
then
it
just
falls
flat
on
its
face
has
a
kind
of
plainjane
blandness
to
it
its
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
just
oddly
thin
and
simple
not
what
i
expect
from
this
brewery
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
the
other
two
of
the
maredsous
family
but
i
dont
remember
them
impressing
me
as
much
as
this
one
a
really
great
beer
and
as
it
warms
up
becomes
better
has
now
got
rid
of
the
metallic
aftertaste
and
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
i
will
recommend
and
buy
again
m
this
is
where
i
had
the
most
trouble
with
this
beer
its
handcrafted
by
authentic
godfearing
belgian
monks
in
a
stone
abbey
according
to
12th
century
tradition
into
a
rich
liquid
too
rich
for
my
tastes
i
took
one
sip
and
realized
this
is
going
to
be
a
long
beer
if
god
forbid
they
let
me
run
the
show
id
lighten
things
up
why
so
serious
maredsous
on
tap
at
cheeky
monk
in
denver
pours
amber
with
a
shortlived
white
head
and
much
lacing
aroma
is
of
raisins
plums
caramel
malt
body
is
full
and
smooth
taste
is
dark
fruit
spices
toffee
and
brown
sugar
finish
is
long
and
spicy
excellent
brew
i
would
definitely
consider
buying
this
by
the
keg
but
only
if
the
price
was
such
that
it
was
less
than
other
quads
like
la
trappe
or
dubbels
like
westmalle
that
i
prefer
more
overall
this
is
a
very
good
duvel
review
from

notes
pours

a

with
a

that
settles
to
a
film
on

of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace

around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
yeast
spices
and
dark

taste
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
yeast
and
some
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
feel
this
one
was
too
thin
without
the
yeast
character
i
want
aroma
forebodes
more
than
the
taste
yielded
d
this
is
a
well
made
dubbed
that
reminds
me
how
subtle
the
yeast
character
should
be
in
a
properly
made
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
probably
more
so
than
any
version
brewed
in
the
new
world
has
managed
to
be
at
milltown
not
really
sure
about
the
vintage
looks
and
smells
like
a
good
dubbel
dark
body
with
a
white
head
smell
is
loaded
with
more
raisins
figs
and
plums
than
cherries
but
the
cherries
are
there
less
boozy
smelling
than
the
others
at
first
it
tastes
exactly
like
westmalle
dubbel
but
the
yeast
really
came
out
as
i
drank
it
and
i
didnt
like
it
i
wanted
more
cherries
and
fruits
and
less
like
eating
a
yeast
packet
medium
bodied
and
as
smooth
as
possible
for
such
a
carbonated
beer
overall
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
version
of
a
dubbel
the
dark
fruits
and
dark
malts
play
off
each
other
well
nice
dubbel
and
weathered
the
years
decently
highly
carbonated
but
deceptively
smoothe
and
clean
on
the
palatte
for
its
size
this
beer
is
best
when
available
from
the
tap
but
it
is
still
great
in
the
bottle
this
is
such
a
great
beer
and
very
consistent
it
was
a
staple
at
my
favorite
european
style
bar
here
in
the
states
it
has
fruity
notes
and
no
bitterness
it
is
amber
to
slightly
dark
with
a
little
head
very
refreshing
cheers
overall
complex
flavour
and
well
balanced
with
good
mouthfeel
a
great
all
around
beer
o
a
pleasant
belgian
dubbel
and
one
that
packs
a
hidden
punch
as
the
alcohol
is
not
prominent
on
the
palate
but
it
makes
its
presence
known
through
a
gradually
rising
warming
sensation
deep
within
definitely
a
beer
to
savor
as
more
than
a
glass
or
two
will
have
you
firmly
in
the
alcohols
grip
what
we
have
is
a
quality
belgian
dubbel
on
par
with
the
likes
of
those
offered
by
st
bernardus
this
is
made
even
better
by
the
fact
that
it
is
wednesday
night
at
obannons
and
that
means
halfprice
pint
night
so
this
8
beer
is
now
only
4
and
you
cannot
beat
that
rich
rich
dubbel
pours
last
last
possible
shade
of
red
before
it
becomes
a
velvety
chocolate
brown
color
nice
lathery
white
head
smells
like
sweet
toffee
and
malts
almost
like
a
heathbar
cookie
molasses
and
a
aromatic
belgian
yeast
flavor
is
also
very
complex
and
layered
with
that
same
toffee
tone
and
a
delicate
dried
fruit
sweetness
the
yeast
is
the
shiny
penny
in
this
beer
though
huge
bouquet
reminds
me
of
late
summer
slightly
tart
and
dry
too
feel
is
lovely
good
carbonation
fuller
body
and
a
very
well
hidden
alcoholic
element
just
picking
up
a
bit
of
warmth
as
it
goes
down
and
settles
this
is
a
great
beer
on
tap
ive
heard
mixed
reviews
about
the
bottled
version
but
my
specimen
was
exceptional
330ml
bottle
poured
into
leffe
chalice
dark
mahogany
colour
medium
tanned
head
hazy
clung
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smelled
rasins
and
grape
tasted
notes
of
red
wine
had
strong
hints
of
dark
chocolate
long
slightly
bitter
finish
the
8abv
was
well
hidden
smooth
texture
good
beer
but
needs
ageing
to
reach
its
full
potential
beer
is
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
it
could
have
been
a
bit
more
thick
okay
not
a
bad
beer
by
far
but
i
just
dont
get
that
much
complexity
beyond
a
very
wine
like
flavor
doa
i
didnt
mind
this
brew
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
any
aspects
i
think
you
could
buy
better
beer
with
less
money
overall
a
tasty
beer
and
a
very
faithful
example
of
the
style
almost
the
archetype
of
a
dubbel
there
are
better
dubbels
out
there
for
sure
but
there
is
really
nothing
wrong
about
this
one
good
in
every
respect
this
is
a
nice
sipping
beer
to
be
enjoyed
and
savored
yeah
paying
cover
sucks
but
the
stamp
tonight
is
at
least
interesting
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
mahogany
topped
by
a
bit
less
than
a
finger
of
creamkhaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
fig
brown
sugar
light
orange
zest
toffee
and
belgian
candi
sugar
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
clove
light
cinnamon
honey
and
very
light
cocoa
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
waterystyle
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
easygoing
dubbel
something
i
could
see
throwing
back
a
few
times
at
the
bar
but
not
necessarily
something
i
would
consider
in
the
upper
echelon
of
belgian
beers
final
thoughts
while
not
as
good
as
the
blonde
this
is
another
exceptional
brew
i
still
have
the
tripel
to
drink
and
i
regrettably
get
the
feeling
that
it
is
going
to
disappoint
in
any
case
youll
want
to
give
this
a
shot
i
think
it
would
go
really
well
with
a
montreal
style
steak
dr
v
v
good
stuff
after
dinner
sippy
beer
overall
wife
says
this
is
the
perfect
christmas
beer
husband
says
i
agreeor
perfect
winter
beer
a
wonderful
beer
overall
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
like
this
stuff
a
lot
complex
wellcrafted
and
very
tasty
i
expect
nothing
else
from
someone
who
has
made
a
vow
of
celibacy
overall
this
was
a
gem
honestly
well
crafted
and
not
overly
complex
and
might
just
need
to
have
another
here
at
the
waterzooi
hope
you
enjoy
as
much
as
me
best
before
07
2012
so
i
assume
this
is
a
couple
years
old
pours
dark
brown
with
a
very
tan
head
that
holds
and
leaves
splotches
of
lace
nose
is
cola
spice
licorice
anise
and
mildly
burnt
toffee
taste
is
cola
spice
toffee
brown
sugar
overripe
plum
date
wood
and
a
touch
of
roast
and
booze
which
translates
rum
and
cokeish
a
bit
big
for
what
i
like
in
my
dubbels
but
full
of
flavor
and
seems
like
it
has
come
together
quite
nicely
medium
full
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
yet
it
somehow
drinks
soft
and
smooth
alcoholic
dark
fruit
aftertaste
with
a
slight
chocolate
roast
kick
in
the
finish
quite
good
but
a
little
hot
and
lacks
real
personality
excellent
dubbel
overalli
will
make
sure
i
keep
going
back
to
get
the
same
old
bottles
overall
i
was
kind
of
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
fuller
in
mouthfeel
as
well
as
taste
after
pouring
and
smelling
i
thought
the
taste
would
be
bland
but
it
was
not
still
a
little
more
dark
fruit
would
make
this
much
better
i
also
think
the
hoppyness
is
one
of
its
saving
graces
3
55
o
solid
stuff
here
enjoyable
and
tasty
o
this
is
fantastic
dubbel
that
has
its
own
character
with
the
added
malty
flavours
of
caramel
and
nuts
an
easy
drinker
that
could
quickly
sneak
up
on
you
and
put
you
on
your
ass
a
great
holiday
brew
o
a
nice
brew
scent
wasnt
where
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
but
everything
else
was
pretty
much
in
line
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
for
me
the
carbonation
is
too
much
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
with
a
big
aroma
and
flavor
to
match
worth
checking
out
fr
sure
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
very
fine
carbonation
gives
this
a
creamycrisp
texture
that
matches
perfectly
with
the
flavours
the
taste
is
more
sweet
dark
fruits
and
sugary
malt
sweetness
with
only
a
touch
of
hoppiness
belgian
yeasts
come
through
here
too
for
an
8
abv
i
was
surprised
it
didnt
have
a
thicker
mouthfeel
this
is
deceptively
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
it
wasnt
so
awesomely
good
that
id
want
several
this
was
a
very
delicious
beer
that
can
serve
either
as
a
nice
sipper
or
can
be
quaffed
with
a
vengeance
an
excellent
cold
weather
drink
a
good
dubbel
but
it
is
a
bit
strong
on
the
raisin
and
somewhat
medicinal
for
me
not
as
carbonated
as
i
would
expect
either
just
not
as
smooth
as
many
similar
ales
aftertaste
i
like
the
aftertaste
but
it
doesnt
last
long
it
is
there
somewhat
sweet
and
then
is
gone
before
you
know
it
what
does
stick
around
is
the
dryness
that
you
get
in
the
nose
the
dryness
in
the
nose
is
that
copper
note
that
i
was
talking
about
you
never
get
the
copper
flavor
though
which
is
nice
like
i
said
before
not
a
huge
fan
of
beers
made
by
monks
but
i
would
order
this
one
again
its
solid
deep
rubynear
brown
colour
ring
of
white
head
little
lace
left
smell
is
yeasty
and
full
of
dark
fruit
dark
bread
and
raisin
scents
mild
funky
scents
as
well
taste
is
quite
dry
and
yeasty
initially
dark
bready
malt
fruity
dark
berries
and
over
ripe
plum
medium
bitterness
earthy
with
a
lightly
sweet
finish
medhigh
carbonation
full
body
great
weight
solid
stuff
here
very
drinkable
and
quite
nice
not
the
most
over
the
top
dubbel
but
quality
stuff
all
the
way
overall
this
is
a
funny
little
beer
i
certainly
enjoy
it
it
is
very
well
made
looks
fantastic
easy
to
drink
and
plenty
interesting
but
it
is
not
really
a
dubbel
with
all
those
roasted
malts
and
i
frankly
have
a
problem
with
that
very
strong
belgian
dubbel
smells
fantastic
tastes
delicious
and
is
boozy
enough
to
provide
some
nice
warming
and
a
drying
finish
without
becoming
overpowering
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
bit
more
fruit
on
the
palate
but
its
a
minor
concern
the
palate
opens
mildly
sweet
with
a
blend
of
dark
brown
sugar
a
little
bit
of
dark
honey
and
some
fruit
raisins
in
particular
the
yeast
expression
is
a
blend
of
sweeter
cinnamon
and
some
doughy
and
yeasty
phenols
i
like
the
blend
of
raisins
and
cinnamon
here
its
quite
enjoyable
especially
with
the
rum
and
brown
sugar
the
initial
sips
reveal
a
mild
metallic
note
but
that
fades
dying
on
the
finish
with
a
mild
hoppy
undernote
an
earthy
bitterness
this
beer
has
some
sweeter
flavors
while
remaining
relatively
dry
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
fine
creamy
carbonation
this
beer
feels
pretty
good
on
the
palate
fruity
mildly
spicy
and
mildly
alcoholic
on
the
finish
this
is
a
very
nicely
done
dubbel
sweeter
than
some
of
the
best
but
very
nice
flavors
here
o
great
brew
that
i
have
walked
by
many
times
glad
i
finally
tried
it
it
is
delicious
overall
a
great
beer
highly
recommeded
listed
as
maredsous
bruin
belgian
amber
at
the
blind
lady
in
san
diego
glad
i
was
able
to
taste
this
on
tap
bottles
have
not
been
so
impressive
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
like
other
belgians
better
but
this
is
a
good
fallback
beer
that
is
readily
available
a
pleasing
and
wellrounded
brew
an
excellent
choice
for
the
cooling
of
the
season
the
8
abv
certainly
doesnt
hurt
it
overall
great
reasonably
priced
quality
belgian
abbey
brew
that
can
be
easier
to
find
than
some
other
offerings
great
introductory
brew
for
new
converts
i
assume
this
is
the
dubbel
as
it
was
designated
on
tap
thin
sweet
aroma
flavor
was
overly
sweet
with
an
unpleasant
bitter
hop
finish
grain
and
sugar
throughout
really
stretched
myself
to
drink
most
of
the
glass
never
again
its
a
solid
beer
all
around
its
good
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
just
not
quite
great
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
very
nicely
done
the
subtlety
is
appreciated
honestly
pretty
disappointed
the
booze
is
obvious
and
up
front
not
even
close
in
terms
of
interesting
flavor
as
a
chimay
or
rochefort
6
or
8
there
are
many
better
true
belgians
to
be
had
also
like
st
fuellien
and
monette
unibroues
darks
and
delirium
nocturnum
also
much
more
subtle
and
flavorful
an
absolute
musttry
for
anyone
who
enjoys
dubbels
and
ales
of
this
kind
very
highly
recommended
what
a
nice
treat
this
one
was
i
picked
a
bottle
up
at
my
local
giant
eagle
the
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
caramel
and
toffee
malt
with
some
dark
fruit
and
candy
sugar
notes
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
i
get
some
nice
raisin
and
prune
notes
as
well
as
some
brown
sugar
caramel
and
some
belgian
yeast
there
is
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
detectable
in
the
flavor
but
it
is
fairly
faint
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
dubbel
this
beer
arrives
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
white
foam
that
recedes
slowly
leaving
rings
of
lacing
all
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
raisins
dates
and
bubblegum
but
it
is
quite
weak
given
the
strength
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
more
bubblegum
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
i
will
pass
on
this
beer
next
time
it
is
decent
but
there
are
so
many
great
belgian
beers
out
there
that
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
again
when
other
options
are
available
overall
too
sharp
in
the
alcohol
not
too
balanced
this
is
not
the
dubbel
for
me
o
it
tastes
good
and
sweet
i
like
it
hides
alcohol
well
but
not
entirely
which
detracts
a
little
of
the
bitter
aftertaste
6

tried
it
again
still
about
the
same
but
the
metallic
is
more
medicinal
this
go
around
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
it
would
have
scored
higher
this
time
decanted
from
a
bottle
to
a
duvel
tulip
a
deep
redbrown
body
voluptuous
foam
filling
the
glass
aroma
is
kind
of
sweet
and
boozey
alcohol
aroma
is
strong
flavor
is
actually
very
sweet
and
candylike
a
balancing
act
of
dryness
sweetness
and
sourness
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
wine
in
a
sense
pleasant
albeit
a
tad
overbearing
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
and
syrupy
astringent
at
the
same
time
overall
this
is
a
decent
dubbel
d
good
smells
solid
drink
one
step
above
6
this
is
very
nice
brew
the
dry
part
is
a
bit
perplexing
as
is
the
lack
of
nose
i
am
generous
in
my
ratings
but
this
one
flat
out
lacks
a
big
piece
sorry
but
jamie
farr
wouldnt
be
able
to
get
anything
out
of
this
one
trying
to
think
of
a
way
for
this
to
work
with
food
and
i
cant
having
this
with
a
black
and
blue
burger
and
it
is
ok
for
cutting
thru
the
fat
and
cheese
and
pepper
but
not
a
great
pairing
maybe
a
pear
and
blue
cheese
tart
i
dunno
this
is
one
you
sit
with
at
night
and
sip
over
time
and
stretch
out
the
enjoyment
i
have
a
bomber
here
and
i
must
say
that
the
8
is
already
catching
up
to
me
and
the
value
9
is
so
very
worth
it
o
tasty
smooth
and
a
well
balanced
dubbel
poured
from
bottle
into
snifter
glass
pours
dark
amber
brown
with
a
medium
beige
head
with
thin
lacing
that
lasts
throughout
the
drinking
session
aroma
of
raisins
plum
grape
caramel
malt
toffee
and
light
floral
notes
thick
creamy
mouthful
reveals
flavors
of
caramel
malt
dark
fruits
plum
figs
raisins
and
considerable
hop
balance
which
is
most
pronounced
on
the
dry
bitter
finish
overall
a
decent
dubbel
the
cpj
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
small
tannish
head
that
dissipates
to
a
think
film
of
bubbles
caramel
malts
in
the
nose
with
dark
fruits
and
dark
sugars
taste
is
of
caramel
and
spice
fruitcake
with
a
bitter
alcohol
finish
for
a
drying
sensation
complex
and
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
dubbel
but
would
not
rank
it
amongst
the
best
belgians
but
definitely
in
the
pack
d
a
good
dubbel
especially
for
the
price
point
nothing
extraordinary
but
it
fits
the
bill
for
the
style
overall
decent
representation
of
the
style
yet
this
didnt
get
me
excited
enough
to
try
it
again
very
easy
to
drink
a
couple
would
go
down
good
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
still
very
good
o
a
nice
dubbel
not
as
rich
or
sweet
as
other
bruns
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
nice
one
its
surprisingly
light
for
the
alcohol
and
kind
of
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
but
i
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
overall
this
is
an
amazing
dubbel
that
is
wonderfully
sweet
and
complex
it
is
a
wonderful
beer
to
spend
an
evening
sipping
on
dirtybeerguy
com
pours
an
amberbrown
color
with
a
small
bit
of
off
white
head
the
smell
is
of
raisins
brown
sugar
and
brandy
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
an
alcohol
warmth
at
the
end
of
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
a
touch
too
much
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
with
some
interesting
flavors
to
it
it
was
brown
with
red
hues
and
an
average
sized
filmy
off
white
head
smells
great
i
got
aromas
of
raisin
molasses
fig
and
caramel
the
tastes
consists
of
some
nutty
and
dark
fruity
flavors
along
with
toffee
and
caramel
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
soft
feel
i
thought
maredsous
8
was
a
world
class
beer
that
i
would
love
to
revisit
on
a
more
sober
note
overall
a
very
complex
beer
with
a
whole
lot
of
different
tastes
going
on
the
beers
flavours
continued
to
change
as
it
approached
room
temperature
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
and
it
has
a
truly
beautiful
appearance
once
poured
in
a
glass
worth
seeking
out
an
excellent
belgian
dubbel
i
hope
to
try
it
head
to
head
with
my
old
favorite
belgian
dubbel
westmalle
and
the
very
similar
i
think
st
martin
d
not
very
smooth
due
to
the
carbonation
kind
of
airy
doesnt
go
down
extremely
smooth
but
not
unpleasant
still
id
have
to
say
my
limit
is
2
at
most
d
probably
not
one
id
try
again
if
this
is
the
way
it
is
supposed
to
taste
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
but
until
i
try
another
this
review
will
stand
if
the
second
bottle
is
different
i
will
update
this
reveiw
3
my
wife
said
it
tasted
like
the
yummy
part
after
biting
a
toffee
apple
bright
tart
sour
green
apple
flavors
followed
by
a
nice
candycoated
burnt
sugar
crunch
fairly
onedimensional
but
classic
in
its
appeal
i
wouldve
expected
a
deeper
or
more
complex
mouthfeel
but
as
a
washingdownlunch
beer
this
worked
out
quite
well
d
good
dubbel
with
roast
qualities
and
well
priced
would
buy
again
4
o
quite
complex
and
drinkable
at
the
same
time
overall
very
well
balanced
a
very
nice
winter
beer
maybe
just
nothing
really
special
its
drinkable
i
guess
but
im
not
finding
much
here
to
make
me
want
to
purchase
this
stuff
again
when
i
think
of
a
belgian
dubbel
this
is
not
what
i
think
of
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
bad
beer
and
it
is
in
fact
a
dubbel
from
belgium
but
when
i
feel
like
cracking
open
a
dubbel
i
dont
think
ill
have
this
one
in
mind
in
the
future
out
of
the
6
8
and
10
from
the
gift
pack
this
oen
takes
the
cake
ive
got
a
real
liking
for
dessertlike
belgians
and
this
one
fits
nicely
into
that
category
drinkability
very
good
this
is
an
easy
but
tasty
brew
if
anything
it
is
a
bit
too
sweetsugary
but
mighty
enjoyable
nonetheless
creamy
mouthfeel
an
highly
pleasant
experience
with
this
one
poured
from
a
tap
a
kickbacks
beer
is
a
deep
dark
orange
borderline
brown
very
low
carbonation
for
a
belgian
which
leads
to
no
head
and
no
lacing
smells
very
sweet
but
the
taste
is
well
balanced
very
drinkable
for
8
very
good
example
of
an
belgian
amber
d
a
great
dubbel
d
a
great
sipping
beer
not
to
be
taken
in
quickly
fairly
high
abv
so
you
wont
drink
too
many
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
but
i
dont
have
any
urges
to
hurry
back
to
the
store
and
restock
d
decent
to
good
dubbel
better
beer
at
same
price
point
i
think
a
little
too
strained
and
taut
for
my
liking
though
the
booze
is
well
hidden
it
is
perhaps
another
strong
indicator
that
this
isnt
something
i
will
be
revisiting
anytime
soon
wellmade
but
just
not
for
this
belgian
brew
heretic
o
very
drinkable
a
clean
beer
with
a
charming
toasted
quality
prevailing
i
would
put
this
on
the
level
of
westmalle
pours
a
deep
violet
hints
of
hazelnut
at
the
edges
light
creamy
head
leaves
great
lace
and
chunky
retention
ideal
subtle
nose
of
dark
fruits
and
slight
vinous
notes
fruit
esters
dark
bread
minor
chocolate
taste
is
just
the
same
dark
fruits
acidic
with
some
green
grapes
skins
here
and
mild
chocolate
notes
yeast
leaves
some
lingering
dryness
reminiscent
of
orval
high
carbonation
and
full
mouthfeel
definitely
a
sipper
yum
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
tastes
of
subtle
dark
fruits
with
a
slight
molasses
like
lingering
finish
with
the
brown
sugar
almost
there
drinks
pretty
smooth
for
the
8
alc
and
it
doesnt
register
in
the
taste
at
all
decent
dubbel
d
good
drinkability
but
i
would
choose
a
number
of
other
dubbels
over
this
that
said
id
have
another
no
problem
this
is
a
great
beer
only
wish
is
could
get
this
in
the
330ml
bottle
i
poured
into
a
snifter
to
an
inch
of
tan
head
it
looks
brown
but
when
held
to
the
light
it
is
more
of
a
copper
color
the
aroma
is
brown
sugar
and
molasses
of
course
there
is
the
spiciness
from
the
yeast
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
the
spiciness
and
the
molasses
come
through
but
there
is
a
bready
malt
taste
in
there
as
well
it
is
very
carbonated
it
leaves
kind
of
a
molasses
cookie
aftertaste
leaving
me
wanting
another
sip
its
a
solid
beer
d
very
good
beer
that
i
could
definitely
drink
more
of
o
does
not
hurt
my
impressions
of
belgian
beers
this
is
a
phenomenal
example
of
a
dubbel
i
could
have
another
750
ml
bottle
easily
drinkability
great
beer
to
sip
on
i
will
most
certainly
be
having
more
of
this
as
winter
comes
its
a
sipper
but
its
extremely
drinkable
drinkability
i
was
quite
surprised
with
this
beer
and
its
appeal
to
the
drinker
i
think
the
beer
is
a
great
session
beer
and
i
would
look
to
drink
it
again
i
was
very
impressed
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
will
definitely
need
to
get
another
maredsous
mix
pack
to
get
this
again
i
would
buy
multiple
bottles
of
it
in
single
form
if
they
were
available
but
this
justifies
my
first
set
jd
notes
if
you
have
this
in
your
regular
food
fridge
please
let
sit
for
atleast
45
mins
before
trying
deffinitely
better
as
the
beer
warms
if
i
didnt
have
a
750ml
bottle
this
might
have
had
a
worse
review
my
second
glass
was
deffinitely
better
than
the
first
the
body
is
creamy
smooth
and
rich
this
is
one
beer
not
to
pass
by
but
the
taste
is
phenomenal
your
mouth
will
be
filled
with
a
surprising
freshness
of
banana
chocolate
coffee
and
other
fruits
a
great
balance
of
bittersweet
hops
at
the
end
which
invigorates
for
more
great
prickly
mouthfeel
asks
for
more
beer
very
drinkable
one
great
beer
drinkability
i
think
the
8
is
hidden
quite
well
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
too
much
rich
brownmahogany
hue
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
cream
colored
head
that
sticks
around
till
you
reach
the
bottom
of
the
glass
earthy
smell
with
clove
banana
caramel
dark
dried
fruit
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
excellent
caramel
and
roasty
bitter
chocolate
up
front
followed
by
a
slightly
spiced
combination
of
cherry
fig
and
prune
the
banana
is
very
faint
but
always
there
velvety
smooth
feel
despite
a
pretty
fair
amount
of
carbonation
seemed
less
sweet
than
other
dubbels
ive
had
which
was
a
big
plus
really
happy
to
have
come
across
this
one
excellent
d
thoroughly
drinkable
a
nice
beer
a
good
dubbel
a
really
nice
afterdinner
beer
should
work
nice
with
many
desserts
dnot
a
bad
beer
seems
to
have
a
few
issues
but
does
offer
a
nicely
balanced
approach
with
a
great
malt
flavor
blending
with
very
ripe
fruits
d
i
dont
know
if
this
was
a
bad
keg
or
not
but
this
beer
was
not
all
that
impressive
which
goes
against
what
people
usually
have
to
say
about
this
beer
perhaps
ill
need
to
revisit
it
later
carbonation
is
almost
text
book
perfect
in
terms
of
how
it
balances
the
aroma
and
taste
profiles
alcohol
is
only
just
noticeable
and
the
beer
most
certainly
settles
into
itself
as
it
warms
up
towards
room
temp
very
good
am
awesome
nose
but
the
taste
is
too
dry
and
bitter
to
be
a
good
dubbel
d
blown
away
at
how
well
this
one
hides
the
abv
as
previously
mentioned
it
does
become
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
but
it
is
not
offensive
i
could
actually
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
session
though
that
could
end
up
being
rather
disastrous
highly
recommended
to
anyone
looking
for
a
dark
malty
belgian
d
a
strange
combination
of
sweet
and
sour
a
great
beer
but
not
one
i
would
drink
often
recommended
its
good
in
a
cold
shaker
but
imagine
it
served
in
its
own
unchilled
glassware
this
is
recommended
drinkability
maredsous
8
is
a
darn
drinkable
beer
im
finding
that
my
appreciation
for
dubbels
grows
with
each
example
of
the
style
i
have
and
this
is
a
good
example
indeed
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
left
a
little
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
i
really
enjoyed
the
aromas
on
this
brew
which
consisted
of
belgian
yeast
cloves
dark
fruits
caramel
toffee
roastiness
and
faint
chocolate
notes
very
complex
upfront
the
belgian
yeast
come
thru
first
on
the
taste
alongside
chocolate
plum
caramel
roasted
malts
and
spice
accents
there
was
also
some
faint
clove
and
booze
notes
as
well
the
beer
was
medium
body
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
creamy
slight
spice
but
boozy
finish
maredsous
8
drank
very
good
and
was
complex
acroos
the
board
and
was
a
very
delicious
beer
taste
is
very
light
super
dry
and
malty
with
a
bunch
of
iron
on
the
finish
carbonation
is
light
and
the
body
is
even
lighter
maybe
ive
been
spoiled
by
westy
8
but
this
isnt
even
as
good
as
my
friend
nates
homebrew
dubbel
drinkability
it
good
alcohol
is
wellconcealed
although
it
smelt
great
i
still
didnt
find
this
any
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
others
of
similar
style
ive
tried
but
im
sure
its
me
and
not
the
beer
smells
better
than
it
tastes
not
enough
flavor
to
back
up
the
burn
disappointed
pours
a

next
comes
some

malty
mouth
feel
is
medium

lots
of

its
on
the
sweet
side
and
is
best
served
50
degrees
the
fruit
and
spices
expand
with
flavor
as
it
warms
i
will
say
i
liked
10
and
6
better
then
this
one
nice
full
aroma
of
yeasty
banana
and
cinnamon
high
carbonation
and
a
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
especially
on
the
finish
brown

and
a
bit

and
drinkable
drinkability
a
nice
belgian
ale
would
buy
again
respect
this
beer
quite
literally
disappeared
from
my
glass
dangerously
drinkable
considering
the
8
abv
im
definitely
going
to
seek
out
more
of
this
d
very
drinkable
beer
bottle
was
split
perfectly
between
two
of
us
1
pint
9
fl
oz
bottle
others
dont
have
to
agree
with
me
but
i
consider
this
one
of
belgiums
finest
dubbels
this
has
everything
i
love
in
this
kind
of
beer
a
painters
tray
of
colours
a
captivating
aroma
and
a
rich
succulent
disposition
that
encourages
slow
appreciative
sips
there
isnt
anything
that
belgiums
other
abbeys
authentic
or
otherwise
have
over
maredsous
d
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
taste
worth
picking
up
sometime
to
try
d
an
affordable
abbey
ale
if
there
ever
was
one
it
may
not
be
the
best
one
out
there
but
it
is
still
quite
enjoyable
750ml
bottle
in
a
tulip
a
thick
dark
brown
great
looking
taste
is
bright
at
first
tough
to
sort
through
the
carbonation
but
there
is
some
date
and
other
dark
fruit
sweetness
along
with
some
roasted
characteristics
as
it
warms
it
gives
way
to
lots
more

4
very
solid
dubbel
as
it
should
be
d
ive
had
a
couple
of
these
now
and
ive
enjoyed
them
very
much
each
time
a
very
nice
dubbel
that
provides
a
great
range
of
flavors
and
aromas
d
really
the
first
abbey
i
have
tried
but
the
hype
made
me
buy
it
and
it
was
kind
of
disappointing
cover
art
has
also
changed
from
the
cool
black
and
red
to
some
plain
jane
white
and
blue
which
made
it
hard
to
find
so
someone
should
really
update
pictures
on
this
site
a
beer
that
bears
its
degree
of
alcohol
in
the
name
served
in
a
duvel
tulip

look
very
dark

color
the
foamy
head
is
thick

with
excellent

and
purple
grapes
like

and
pine
hops
taste
roasted
breadymalts

and
spicy

mouthfeel
hot
bitter

the
finish
is
bittersweet
show
its
alcohol
strenght
passing
through
the
throat
robust
body
with
medium
carbonation
very
similar
to
wine
drinkability
sometimes
i
thought
i
was
drinking
a
glass
of
wine
but
was
belgian
beer
d
its
very
easy
to
drink
as
theres
neither
too
much
sweetness
nor
too
much
alcohol
overall
decent
nothing
special
d
a
delicious
brown
ale
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
notes
pairs
excellently
with
sharp
cheddar
cheese
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
good
body
without
being
too
thick
just
enough
carbonation
maredsous
8
is
one
of
my
favorit
brews
quite
drinkable
and
always
delicious
d
balanced
and
finishes
clean
without
any
one
flavor
over
dominating
this
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
its
worth
trying
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
d
despite
a
few
criticisms
and
an
8
abv
this
beer
is
highly
quaffable
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
6
and
10
tastes
all
fab
and
whatnot
damn
near
a
5
but
not
quite
starts
with
burny
fruit
raisins
prunes
and
seared
bananas
moves
into
a
middle
of
aggressive
effervescence
the
fizziness
leads
to
a
spriteish
kind
of
bland
sweetnes
though
thankfully
soon
afterwards
theres
a
backend
blend
of
schwarzbier
ash
dubble
fruit
and
pleasantly
alcoholic
belgian
yeast
overall
impression
another
authentic
dubbel
brewed
in
belgium
very
nice
much
better
than
their
tripel
d
i
think
that
it
really
depends
on
what
you
are
doing
too
sweet
for
an
all
nighter
postreviewing
note
after
reviewing
this
beer
i
read
through
some
other
reviews
and
i
have
to
thank
davejanssen
for
using
the
term
metallic
in
describing
the
flavor
this
is
right
on
with
the
rochefort
10
experience
i
described
above
d
i
tried
it
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
try
the
others
in
the
series
d
obviously
an
expertly
crafted
brew
the
combination
of
the
hops
and
the
effervescence
in
this
one
make
it
a
very
refreshing
beerdrinking
experience
and
add
a
dryness
to
the
taste
very
drinkable
very
delicious
notes
the
flavors
mix
really
well
and
although
is
is
more
sweet
than
anything
else
no
specific
flavor
really
outweighs
another
really
good
tasting
beer
ideas
from
fellow
taster
happy
i
tried
it
it
does
pack
a
punch
i
liked
it
but
i
had
to
almost
push
myself
to
finish
the
10
oz
pour
drink
is
good
i
was
blown
away
by
this
beverage
and
i
think
one
of
the
very
best
dubbels
ive
had
yet
not
my
favorite
but
a
quality
brew
filmore

carbonation
is
stingy
at
a
little
hard
lowto
mid
bodied
very
easy
to
drink
one
after
the
other
for
a
dubble
overall
too
sticky
sweet
and
boozy
to
want
to
drink
two
also
carbonic
bite
dimished
drinkability
the
mouth
which
inevitably
recalls
the
roasted
malt
however
is
very
strange
it
collects
suspicion
of
alcohol
especially
whiskey
some
even
see
the
cola
in
the
same
suspicions
and
more
whiskey
the
nose
evokes
the
same
strange
combination
of
flavors
similarly
to
the
finish
in
warm
alcohol
however
this
unusual
mouth
that
resembles
a
mix
between
beer
style
dubble
and
style
quadrupel
is
full
of
generosity
and
pleasure
found
this
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
in
charlotte
nc
it
shows
a
deep
nearly
opaque
blackbrownroot
beer
color
with
a
fair
light
brown
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
simple
light
malt
clean
and
crisp
wheatlike
the
first
mouthful
brings
a
well
carbonated
malty
molasses
with
a
pleasant
herbal
hop
background
this
is
a
subtle
blend
with
nice
complexity
in
a
medium
to
light
body
and
lively
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
get
some
belgiumesque
clovelike
qualities
in
the
balance
a
quality
brew
very
much
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
little
thin
with
a
biting
carbonation
a
different
flavour
profile
to
most
dubbels
ive
had
and
an
interesting
deviation
from
the
norm
this
could
be
the
dubbel
i
reach
for
when
im
after
something
less
sweet
drinkability
easy
to
drink
an
looking
forawrd
to
having
another
reminds
me
of
the
chimay
styles
this
beer
pours
a
much
fuller
head
than
the
10
it
turns
frothy
after
some
time
and
collects
as
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
darker
pour
with
some
amber
tints
tastes
of
some
cocoa
grains
spice
smoke
sweet
transgresses
to
a
sour
fruit
finish
sweet
spice
is
heavy
on
the
tip
of
the
tounge
i
had
this
beer
once
before
in
brussels
but
this
bottle
was
a
750ml
import
it
poured
a
beautiful
brown
with
a
touch
of
red
with
a
creamy
head
that
outlasted
the
beer
it
had
a
wonderful
aroma
of
raisins
and
roasted
nuts
the
different
tastes
in
this
beer
are
subtle
dark
stone
fruits
with
a
touch
of
sour
like
black
cherries
there
are
some
floral
notes
in
the
middle
that
appear
when
the
carbonation
releases
it
feels
quite
fizzy
in
your
mouth
to
start
but
quickly
dissipates
pours

clearish
red
colored

side
note
had
it
on
draft
at
the
saucer
last
night
completely
by
coincidence
i
forgot
this
was
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
and
i
can
safely
say
that
i
prefer
it
on
draft
i
remember
it
being
more
crisp
less
fruity
and
tasting
less
alcoholic
at
the
bar
but
i
was
a
few
deep
at
the
time
so
its
hard
to
say
definitively
hard
to
go
wrong
with
maredsous
though
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
someone
who
seeks
a
yeasty
unripened
fruit

a
dry

a

a

drinkable
belgian
brew
i
found
this
at
the
morton
williams
in
nyc
have
never
seen
it
before
quite
tasty
overall
a
nice
dubble
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
personally
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
in
the
unfiltered
form
great
stuff
that
should
be
tried
by
the
belgian
lovers
dark
copperred
with
an
inch
of
brown
foam
mixed
bubbles
nose
is
sweet
caramel
malt
hints
of
grape
and
ripe
fruit
ever
so
light
toast
wineygrape
flavour
up
front
with
a
big
medicinal
kick
too
much
i
think
lots
of
bitterness
and
sharp
carbonation
on
the
sweet
side
which
is
a
welcome
balance
to
the
other
flavours
body
feels
light
given
the
intensity
of
the
flavour
profile
i
dont
love
this
one
750ml
corker
at
fox
and
the
hound
dark
brown
beer
with
belgian
yeast
in
the
nose
and
brown
malt
dark
fruit
like
figs
and
dates
nothing
purple
and
molasses
in
the
taste
was
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
which
is
new
to
me
in
a
belgian
beer
molasses
and
coriander
thick
and
a
beer
to
be
savored
i
liked
the
lower
carbonation
it
complemented
the
big
flavor
and
did
not
detract
from
the
beers
overall
character
cheers
smooth
thick
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
drinkable
overall
im
somewhat
disappointed
was
expecting
more
not
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
was
given
this
by
another
nonbelgian
guy
with
high
recommendations
very
surprised
and
appreciate
it
diamond
in
the
rough
overall
pretty
good
dubbel
here
not
my
favorite
example
of
this
style
but
definitely
worth
trying
d
a
nice
dubbel
from
a
great
brewery
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
if
you
get
your
hands
on
the
75
cl
bottle
youd
be
a
fool
if
you
wont
buy
it
poured
into
a
maredsous
glass
with
a
couple
inches
of
light
bubbly
head
at
least
part
of
which
stuck
around
for
the
whole
show
smell
was
interesting
dark
fruity
malts
a
bit
of
spice
and
some
tangyness
that
i
wasnt
crazy
about
sipping
on
this
confirmed
that
worry
there
were
nice
fruity
malts
plum
raisin
and
some
interesting
spice
anice
clove
but
the
the
tangy
kinda
medicinal
background
kept
me
from
really
loving
this
one
definitely
a
complex
and
interesting
beer
that
i
liked
trying
but
not
something
i
plan
on
trying
to
hunt
down
in
the
future
poured
an
medium
brown
with
a
generous
head
that
was
retained
throughout
the
drink
the
aroma
had
a
medicinal
quality
along
with
alcohol
and
malty
sweet
the
taste
was
somewhat
sweet
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
grapes
were
the
only
other
thing
i
could
pick
out
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
fairly
high
carbonation
drinkability
was
ok
not
a
fan
this
beer
went
down
way
too
quickly
and
i
must
commend
it
highly
overall
this
one
kick
ass
beer
with
almost
undescribable
flavors
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
and
am
sure
i
will
be
having
it
again
sometime
this
is
a
strange
dubbel
compared
to
what
ive
had
so
far
very
malty
with
elements
of
chocolate
caramel
and
dark
fruits
a
much
darker
look
and
flavor
than
your
standard
dubbel
alcohol
is
pretty
much
undetectable
very
slight
yeast
notes
which
i
found
to
be
unusual
for
this
style
of
beer
this
brew
is
good
but
not
great
drinkabilty
certain
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
dubbel
alcohol
is
a
little
hot
but
not
overwhelming
definitely
a
nice
example
of
the
style
though
there
are
surely
some
out
there
that
shine
a
bit
brighter
with
more
complexity
and
richer
finish
worth
trying
and
respectable
belgian
trappist
brew
overall
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
sipper
very
drinkable
and
solid
reminds
me
of
a
dubbel
with
a
lot
of
porter
qualities
to
it
drinkability
oh
yeah
highly
drinkable
ill
buy
this
again
dark
chestnut
color
filmy
head
looks
pretty
good
the
smell
is
a
nice
malty
raisin
type
piece
and
screams
dubbel
unfortunately
the
taste
is
heavily
dominated
by
alcohol
and
the
mouthfeel
is
astringent
making
this
hard
to
drink
actually
i
am
disappointed
in
this
beer
the
alcohol
was
just
not
well
integrated
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
hazy
tawny
amberbrown
colour
there
was
a
fine
beige
collar
and
islands
of
bubbles
coating
the
surface
of
the
beer
sticky
spotty
lace
malty
fruity
aroma
plums
and
raisins
bready
toffee
slight
alcohol
fairly
spicy
toasted
malt
i
like
it
on
to
the
flavour
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
malts
and
fruit
but
the
spice
was
more
pronounced
and
lingered
on
the
palate
along
with
sour
cherry
and
toffee
the
body
was
oddly
thin
and
the
carbonation
was
a
little
higher
than
average
which
made
for
a
decent
texture
light
alcohol
warmth
this
beer
was
a
really
nice
surprise
the
spicy
character
was
unexpected
but
was
quite
good
not
a
bad
offering
but
there
are
many
others
of
this
style
id
recommend
further
in
line
md
easy
drinkable
carbonation
a
bit
thin
alcohol
is
as
should
be
drinkability
is
great
for
such
a
big
complex
beer
id
have
another
one
it
gets
some
extra
points
for
being
both
big
drinkable
very
enjoyable
but
not
overwhelming
d
a
nice
beer
overall
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
i
think
the
maredsous
10
tripel
is
incredible
this
is
merely
very
good
i
have
no
problem
with
that
and
will
have
no
problem
savoring
the
rest
of
this
goblet
notes
interesting
to
find
and
enjoy
on
tap
but
i
believe
that
prefer
the
bottle
it
is
bottle
fermented
afterall
pretty
drinkable
brew
this
is
one
i
might
like
better
in
a
bottle
also
overall
a
good
dubbel
lacking
in
the
mouthfeel
reviewed
on

bottle
pours
a
somewhat
translucent
brown
with
thick
light
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
raisins
flavor
of
more
of
the
same
booze
raisins
sweet
malt
ick
this
was
very
bland
and
too
sweet
yep
this
was
a
disappointment
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
colored
head
the
head
is
retained
nicely
and
it
leaves
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
a
very
nice
strong
roasted
malt
raisin
molasses
aroma
with
some
belgian
yeast
and
spice
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
very
close
to
the
aroma
a
nice
bready
roasted
malt
fig
raisin
molasses
taste
with
a
touch
of
clove
spice
the
warming
alcohol
feel
and
flavor
is
apparent
at
first
and
then
fades
nicely
as
you
drink
there
is
a
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
dry
other
than
that
the
mouthfeel
is
generally
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
and
maybe
a
little
bit
on
the
thin
side
drinkability
is
great
a
great
aroma
and
delicious
taste
make
this
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
d
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
well
worth
a
try
drinkability
probably
the
second
most
favorite
beer
ive
ever
tasted
complex
without
being
overpowering
and
the
grain
takes
precendent
with
hops
almost
no
where
to
be
found
this
this
is
the
beer
i
was
looking
for
when
i
said
theres
gotta
be
something
other
than
lagers
drinkability
due
to
its
sweetness
i
could
tire
of
it
in
a
session
but
as
a
single
brew
or
two
its
a
very
tasty
double
style
served
from
a
bottle
to
a
weizen
glass
only
actual
beer
glass
i
currently
have
d
this
was
a
great
dubbel
almost
on
par
with
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
westmalle
very
complex
and
packs
a
punch
yet
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
a
dangerous
combination
for
sure
poured
into
a
goblet
for
onefinger
soapy
tan
head
that
left
lace
patches
all
over
the
glass
with
a
dark
brown
hue
a
wonderful
smell
of
caramel
cocoa
malts
along
w
yeast
and
some
heavy
fruits
like
grape
smooth
and
creamy
yet
has
a
shaprness
due
to
good
carbonation
also
a
little
bready
and
chewey
has
some
sweet
caramelized
malt
in
the
beer
that
gives
off
some
bitter
chocolate
taste
and
finishes
dry
and
husky
thanks
to
roasted
malts
comboed
with
hop
bitterness
and
some
spices
and
fruit
flavors
like
orange
a
complex
beer
that
is
well
worth
the
money
and
was
great
to
sip
on
a
bomber
bottle
beer
smoothes
as
it
warms
p
s
keep
your
eye
on
the
cork
and
away
from
it
just
my
personal
experience
cheers
i
got
this
in
a
gift
pack
with
the
glass
and
i
unfortunately
cant
buy
it
separately
here
i
may
go
back
for
another
gift
pack
just
to
have
another
one
of
these
pretty
much
a
perfect
drink
the
taste
is
port
sweetsour
plums
fermented
fruit
strawberry
and
cherry
jam
hints
of
licorice
and
cola
sweet
toastiness
but
otherwise
it
soon
falls
a
bit
flat
in
character
and
feel
after
the
initial
great
start
pours
brown
in
color
clear
with
some
copper
notes
very
big
light
tan
head
great
retention
smell
nutty
caramely
malty
alcohol
slightly
showing
taste
bready
nutty
some
fruitiness
is
there
as
well
alcohol
is
coming
through
but
in
the
nice
way
great
balance
very
smooth
brew
very
drinkable
great
beer
all
around
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
nice
fruity
and
malty
component
i
like
this
one
and
can
see
it
getting
even
better
with
a
little
age
d
a
drikable
beer
not
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
but
still
a
well
crafted
beer
d
a
solid
dubbel
but
nothing
spectacular
very
drinkable
but
wont
overwhelm
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
this
will
get
you
messed
up
quickly
d
it
was
easy
to
put
this
down
but
i
didnt
get
much
out
of
it
wont
really
seek
this
out
in
the
future
at
least
on
tap
i
may
consider
a
bottle
but
theres
nothing
in
this
experience
that
makes
me
feel
compelled
to
do
so
drinkability
before
i
realized
it
this
thing
was
almost
gone
i
like
dubbels
i
love
this
light
flavorful
and
very
aromatic
will
definitely
buy
again
a
good
dubbel
to
be
sure
one
of
my
favorites
especially
at
6
for
14oz
a
pretty
good
deal
drinkability
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
a
dubbel
that
ill
return
to
in
the
future
i
could
sit
and
sip
my
way
through
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
at
8
abv
that
is
probably
not
a
good
idea

d
this
is
one
of
the
least
boring
beers
out
there
you
need
to
sip
it
though
to
appreciate
it
but
i
must
say
i
would
mind
sipping
the
hell
out
of
a
4pack
smell
was
pretty
much
non
existent
but
which
was
made
up
for
by
taste
which
had
a
nice
full
flavor
not
complex
but
satisfying
with
heavy
malt
taste
not
too
much
yeast
though
a
hint
and
enough
to
be
a
good
but
not
great
example
of
the
style
no
westmalle
here
but
certainly
drinkable
d
it
drinks
quite
easily
but
it
wasnt
that
great
the
taste
was
somewhat
of
a
letdown
considering
the
smell
ive
had
this
one
served
in
bottle
as
well
and
the
bottled
version
is
far
better
than
this
one
pours
a
rich
opaque
light
chocolaty
brown
with
a
fine
fluffy
pale
tan
head
appetizing
aroma
is
fruity
and
slightly
smoky
with
some
yeasty
hints
sharp
flavor
is
strongly
fruity
and
has
undertones
of
malt
and
yeast
and
it
goes
down
with
a
smooth
lively
texture
it
is
a
well
balanced
dubbel
but
not
terribly
exciting
salud
an
opaque
brown
pour
is
topped
with
a
twofinger
somewhat
airy
tan
head
retention
is
excellent
with
a
slow
fade
and
sheets
of
lacing
left
to
and
fro
smells
of
dark
fruits
grapes
and
figs
sweet
bread
grain
and
vinegar
tastes
grainy
and
malty
underneath
that
are
some
more
light
fruits
and
subtle
hops
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
the
aroma
but
works
well
it
goes
down
crisp
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
from
my
limited
knowledge
of
belgians
i
can
say
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
from
my
personal
taste
all
thoughts
on
style
etc
aside
i
can
say
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
overall
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
the
palate
was
a
little
weak
for
me
but
the
rest
of
it
was
simply
a
tasting
enjoyable
treat
a
drinkable
brew
id
definitely
get
again
d
very
tasty
well
balanced
complex
perhaps
a
bit
too
astringent
for
me
but
otherwise
very
good
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
bubbly
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
glass
of
this
at
a
time
theres
just
too
much
going
on
i
like
it
as
a
special
occasion
beer
revisited
on
91809
served
in
tulip
glass
this
time
i
mostly
stand
by
my
original
review
but
have
added
to
the
score
in
taste
and
drinkability
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
d
very
drinkable
considering
its
style
the
thickness
makes
it
take
a
while
but
its
certainly
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
very
prominent
after
half
a
glass
but
isnt
bad
at
all
a
hugely
complex
beer
i
echo
the
other
bas
in
suggesting
you
let
this
warm
a
bit
before
giving
it
a
shot
cooling
it
too
much
will
allow
the
alcohol
to
take
over
completely
drinkability
its
tasty
and
enjoyable
enough
to
hold
my
interest
throughout
each
of
the
11
2
ounces
well
that
was
a
fairly
fine
dubbel
i
ought
to
be
damned
ashamed
of
myself
for
waiting
nearly
four
years
since
the
last
one
recommended
notes
a
really
solid
pleasantly
rich
rather
sweet
dubbel
that
proves
to
be
quite
complex
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
highly
recommended
drinkability
a
firstclass
brew
truly
one
of
the
classics
of
the
style
you
wont
want
to
put
this
one
down
good
tasty
beer
decent
but
not
very
exciting
best
by
sept
2010
on
label
all
in
all
the
beer
was
highly
enjoyable
the
flavors
are
so
complex
and
interesting
that
i
felt
it
was
really
designed
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
sip
by
sip
savor
this
one
take
it
slow
and
it
will
be
a
wonderful
experience
over
all
beer
is
good
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
apparent
than
most
8
beers
this
is
also
the
case
with
duvel
imo
so
maybe
its
something
to
do
with
the
brewery
still
is
a
decent
brew
and
wouldnt
mind
having
acouple
more
drinking
from
the
bottle
tonight
it
pours
a
very
deep
red
with
a
brown
hue
the
head
is
thin
and
has
a
tinge
of
beige
initial
smell
of
oats
and
cinnamon
perhaps
theres
sweet
taste
behind
a
light
flavor
of
smoke
a
hint
of
fruit
cherries
i
think
but
not
very
define
definitely
a
different
taste
from
the
tap
not
as
distinct
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
as
not
to
distract
from
the
flavor
not
the
smoothest
beer
ive
ever
had
but
theres
no
problems
taking
it
down
off
the
tap
at
american
flatbread
this
belgian
offering
was
a
deep
chestnut
color
the
head
was
a
thick
cap
of
tan
bubbles
that
displayed
excellent
retention
and
left
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
complex
mix
of
semisweet
malt
with
chocolate
ripened
fruit
assorted
dry
grains
and
some
alcohol
the
flavors
were
equally
complex
rich
malt
caramel
light
chocolate
fruity
alcohol
esters
belgian
yeast
and
a
slightly
grainy
note
towards
the
end
along
with
some
floral
hops
that
offered
balance
as
it
warmed
up
the
alcohol
came
forward
and
began
to
quash
the
complexity
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
watery
but
exceptionally
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
delicate
future
outlook
very
good
drink
but
i
cant
see
myself
running
out
to
get
more
anytime
soon
the
beer
pours
a
dark
cherry
color
with
a
small
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cover
rapidly
to
me
the
smell
is
the
8s
strong
suit
there
is
a
complex
mixture
of
sweet
malts
with
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
that
comes
through
more
prominently
in
the
taste
the
taste
seems
to
minimize
the
positives
of
the
nose
while
amplifying
the
negatives
the
alcohol
and
upfront
bitterness
are
a
little
too
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
notices
a
high
carbonation
that
lasts
throughout
a
beer
i
spent
an
hour
drinking
it
will
be
something
that
i
revisit
from
time
to
time
but
not
something
that
i
would
drink
backtoback
overall
tastes
great
and
highly
carbonated
throughout
makes
this
very
drinkable
this
is
almost
ideal
of
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
dubble
only
downfall
is
its
a
bit
pricey
drinkability
absolutely
recommend
this
one
feel
is
medium
bodied
it
has
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
carbonation
and
also
enough
to
coat
the
tongue
creamy
psilo
very
impressive
overall
and
a
great
example
of
this
classic
belgian
style
very
tasty
belgium
brew
i
could
go
for
a
4
pack
of
these
and
do
a
side
to
side
with
nb
abby
ale
overall
a
very
good
belgian
dubbel
easily
paired
with
food
nice
beer
overall
and
makes
me
want
to
try
the
siblings
6
10
overall
sweet
fruity
and
warming
make
it
a
decent
dubbel
interesting
and
drinkable
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
if
you
can
get
it
try
it
its
worth
it
this
is
a
great
dubbel
very
complex
malt
profile
with
a
good
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
high
a
great
beer
that
goes
down
really
easily
and
hides
the
abv
very
well
the
fact
that
its
a
reasonably
priced
and
widely
available
for
an
abby
style
brew
dosent
hurt
either
this
is
good
stuff
its
not
something
you
want
to
set
down
a
kill
a
six
pack
of
but
take
your
time
and
savor
maybe
with
a
good
smoke
andor
an
antipasti
plate
d
yuck
i
wish
i
wouldnt
have
gotten
the
bomber
to
tart
and
to
much
of
a
plastic
type
taste
dgreat
drinkability
i
look
forward
to
purchasing
a
bottle
of
this
and
maredsouss
other
offerings
in
the
future
very
smooth
extremely
complex
flavor
d
hohum
went
well
with
garlic
bread
not
so
much
with
steak
has
a
nice
orange
color
to
it
this
is
the
2nd
of
a
sampler
i
got
and
as
the
first
i
cant
really
give
it
a
fair
review
for
its
smell
damn
smokers
taste
is
great
a
spicy
malty
brew
with
a
suptle
hop
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
is
good
has
a
rich
full
mouthfeel
to
it
a
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
in
illinois
dark
mahogany
pour
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
deep
heavy
aroma
of
malt
peat
smoke
and
molasses
creamy
mouthfeel
heavy
malt
caramel
and
dark
fruits
in
the
taste
occasional
popthrough
of
the
peat
but
not
consistently
long
aftertaste
very
nice
d
one
is
enough
in
a
single
sitting
good
stuff
but
the
alcohol
can
be
a
little
hard
to
stomach
d
a
very
nice
beer
one
of
my
favorite
a
classic
bottle
from
winking
lizard
pours
a
lustrous
rubybrown
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
has
good
retention
patches
of
lacing
on
the
glass
bouquet
of
fruits
and
spices
as
well
as
some
yeast
and
malt
mediumbodied
with
roasted
malt
yeast
and
spice
flavors
dark
fruit
and
hops
undertones
as
well
the
finish
is
fruit
and
oak
with
a
spicy
yeast
aftertaste
solid
all
around
drinkability
this
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
dubbel
that
is
quite
drinkable
however
i
really
was
expecting
a
bit
more
especially
on
tap
d
good
drinkability
at
first
but
after
3
the
strong
alcohol
taste
will
stop
you
a
very
complex
dubbel
rich
fruity
and
spicy
this
is
quite
a
tough
balancing
act
to
accomplish
but
duvel
pulls
it
off
without
many
flaws
take
my
advice
and
let
this
one
warm
to
room
temperature
before
enjoying
the
spices
and
fruity
esters
really
come
through
overall
this
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
dubbels
in
my
opinion
and
the
light
tartness
is
a
nice
surprise
worth
a
shot
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
thick
dense
head
that
settles
into
a
puffy
cap
wine
like
aromas
dominate
but
are
not
overly
strong
a
bit
of
a
metallic
twang
and
a
sugary
sweetness
the
taste
starts
of
with
red
wine
flavors
which
is
cut
by
slightly
roasted
malt
a
metallic
twang
follows
finishes
with
a
nice
sweetness
the
feel
is
firm
with
prickly
carbonation
sweet
throughout
though
crisp
not
sticky
rounds
out
with
a
light
bitterness
a
very
sturdy
dubbel
hits
all
of
the
main
flavors
spot
on
could
use
a
touch
more
zest
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
the
flavor
does
not
quite
meet
the
expectations
promised
from
the
wonderful
aromas
and
appearance
perhaps
some
age
would
help
with
that
i
would
certainly
try
this
beer
again
there
are
enough
complexities
to
suggest
many
different
experiences
to
be
had
from
resampling
excellent
taste
multidimensional
and
intriguing
just
slightly
sweet
with
some
dark
fruit
subtle
raisin
chicory

of
wine
you
can
definitely
sense
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
as
well
slippery

with
pretty
strong
carbonation
a
delicious
brew
i
would
have
again
and
again
overall
a
very
complex

wonderful
dubbel
well
disguised
strong
beer
beware
very
well
balanced
with
a
great
body
and
a
strong
personality
a
must
have
d
certainly
would
take
another
but
this
is
not
as
good
as
chimay
and
not
close
to
westmalle
or
st
bernardus
d
this
is
easily
becoming
a
favorite

mine
it

nice
stuff
ive
enjoyed
this
one
for
years
just
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
tasted
like
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
some
nice
phenols
with
a
yeasty
backbone
and
plenty
of
esters
a
touch
of
roasttoast
in

and
fig
that
added

mouthfeel
was
smooth
refreshing
but
warming
nice
amount
of
carbonation

warmth
overall
a
great
dubbel
not
the
best
ive
had
and
not
terribly
unique
but
very
well
done
delicious
and
succulent
maredsous
dubbel
is
fullish
in
body
with
a
fine
sizzle
of
carbonation
great
feel
and
excellent
drinkability
smells
drinkable
but
im
disappointed
by
the
way
the
alcohol
dulls
the
other
flavors
upfront
possibly
with
some
aging
this
may
improve
however
im
just
not
impressed
with
the
overall
taste
d
its
a
bit
of
an
asskicker
with
the
abundance
of
alcohol
and
huge
strong
flavors
not
a
bad
sipper
but
one
is
enough
mouthfeel
has
a
very
creamy
quality
from
the
carbonation
there
is
an
alcohol
warmth
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
will
be
getting
more
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
delicious
brew
very
complex
wish
i
had
more
perfect
appearance
with
a
reddishburgundy
color
with
yellow
edges
perfect
belgian
head
forms
great
shapes
and
lasts
and
laces
well
really
light
aromas
with
out
much
to
describe
nice
flavor
balance
with
a
touch
of
cherries
mocha
caramel
and
dough
clean
but
not
vibrant
light
mouth
feel
decent
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
great
sipper
or
diner
beer
crisp
effervescence
almost
tangy
bite
not
expected
a
cola
kind
of
bite
to
it
light
bodied
good
but
kind
of
odd
for
a
belgian
brune
this
was
indeed
an
exceptional
beer
and
a
benchmark
for
other
dubbels
im
eager
to
find
out
how
much
difference
there
is
between
the
tap
and
bottle
versions
there
is
something
about
this
style
that
hits
me
these
are
more
like
fine
wine
im
by
no
means
complaining
by
the
high
marks
you
can
see
md
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
a
little
light
hence
the
drinkability
is
high
and
the
abv
is
hidden
very
well
excellent
beer
but
can
be
savoured
only
in
small
quantities
i
would
call
this
more
of
a
dubbel
than
a
belgian
strong
ale
but
in
any
case
it
was
very
good
the
head
is
very
good
and
so
clingy
that
its
almost
concave
in
the
glass
hearty
flavors
of
fruit
and
spice
with
a
sharp
satisfying
finish
a
good
dessert
beer
though
id
have
it
any
time
fairly
nice
most
likely
will
drink
again
considering
its
1000
am
i
probably
shouldnt
be
drinking
this
at
all
but
even
with
its
heavy
dubbel
belgian
body
it
goes
down
surprisingly
well
d
easy
to
drink
alcohol
a
bit
too
prominent
though
overall
a
good
dark
beer
to
sip
on
probably
the
best
offering
from
maredsous
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
dubbels
out
there
great
complex
blending
of
flavors
taste
is
richstarts
with
the
sweetly
spiced
fruits
some
malt
in
the
middle
and
ends
slighly
creamy
no
alcohol
is
present
even
in
the
bouquetmaking
this
a
deceptive
8
in
the
mouth
this
is
very
smooth
with
flavors
melding
together
very
well
highly
drinkable
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
appearance
is
murky
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
head
for
the
duration
aroma
has
moderate
esters
of
black
cherry
and
other
dark
fruits
as
well
as
some
malt
a
hint
of
flowery
european
hops
and
that
familiar
spiciness
of
belgian
yeast
taste
has
some
moderate
bitterness
upfront
with
loads
of
dark
fruity
esters
cant
decide
if
that
bitterness
is
due
to
the
hops
or
some
weird
dark
malt
or
what
regardless
its
overly
bitter
and
not
very
smooth
for
a
dubbel
im
a
bit
disappointed
but
maybe
it
was
the
dregs
of
the
keg
or
something
pours
dark
brown
but
very
clear
decent
creme
head
spicy
flavor
a
bit
minor
dough
its
mostly
spices
but
not
very
overpowering
at
that
the
carbonation
bites
quite
a
bit
liquid
feel
is
decent
enough
nice
to
drink
smooth
with
enough
bite
to
keep
it
interesting
had
this
one
on
tap
at
whistle
binkies
south
dark
amber
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
and
would
have
been
a
nice
amount
of
foam
had
the
bartender
not
filled
the
chalice
to
the
top
but
no
complaints
on
that
end
smell
of
some
dark
candied
fruits
yeast
and
apple
cider
taste
was
similar
dark
fruits
raisins
rumsoaked
fruit
spiced
apple
cider
sweet
and
only
the
slightest
bit
of
hop
bitterness
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
made
the
mouthfeel
slick
but
seemed
a
bit
watery
and
light
to
mediumbodied
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
d
good
with
a
really
pleasant
tartness
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
especially
if
you
want
a
belgian
with
some
substance
that
wont
try
to
hit
you
too
hard
there
are
are
better
beers
but
this
is
a
great
one
poured
from
330ml
bottle
into
one
of
my
trappiststyle
stemmed
glasses
immediately
noticed
the
rich
color
this
is
definitely
an
abbey
dubbel
head
set
up
very
nicely
but
not
too
thick
fairly
low
in
carbonation
then
it
hit
me
that
glorious
scent
of
caramel
malt
very
potent
in
scent
immediately
upon
pouring
about
10
minutes
of
breathing
time
and
the
scent
mellows
my
first
sip
of
this
beer
and
i
immediately
thought
wow
this
is
one
of
the
only
belgian
dubbels
that
i
have
had
that
wasnt
too
overpowering
on
the
first
sip
most
that
ive
had
usually
seem
too
sweet
on
first
sip
so
i
generally
gravitate
towards
the
tripels
which
have
more
bite
my
second
sip
and
i
knew
that
this
was
a
very
good
beer
mouthfeel
typical
of
most
topquality
belgian
styles
almost
fluffy
and
light
while
still
reminding
you
how
big
the
beer
really
is
while
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
8
abv
is
not
to
be
taken
lightly
if
this
had
been
a
750ml
bottle
it
may
have
been
too
much
for
a
wednesday
night
aroma
of
burt
caramel
cream
roasted
sugar
and
yeast
flavor
is
reminisent
of
a
creme
brul√©
served
with
cognac
rich
velvet
caramel
pungent
earty
yeast
esters
and
a
delicious
dark
roasted
malt
finish
absolutely
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
really
nice
and
complex
with
smooth
mouthfeel
and
great
drinkability
quite
a
nice
sipper
i
dont
want
it
to
be
over
drinkable
but
not
much
above
the
ordinary
especially
for
a
belgian
very
nice
head
decent
flavor
some
fruity
notes
high
alcohol
content
somewhat
tastable
expensive
for
what
you
get
good
but
not
great
other
belgians
are
worth
the
price
decent
drinkability
nice
drinker
in
a
snifter
would
buy
it
again
taste
followed
suit
although
the
sweet
elements
were
definitely
more
dominant
in
the
taste
body
was
a
bit
thicker
more
viscous
than
other
dubbels
ive
had
very
in
keeping
with
its
appearance
though
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
ale
but
with
very
little
in
the
stomach
prior
to
this
visit
one
was
certainly
enough
if
you
know
what
i
mean
will
definitely
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
and
compare
pours
very
dark
more
brown
than
russet
with
a
lovely
thick
cream
colored
head
that
sticks
the
glass
and
the
beer
aromas
indicate
that
this
will
be
a
rich
chocolaty
dubbel
with
sugared
figs
chocolate
malt
cloves
and
raw
alcohol
predominating
on
the
palate
rich
thick
flavors
with
bracing
countering
bitterness
for
the
sweet
malts
spicy
chocolate
malts
yeasty
fruits
and
finely
honed
bitterness
characterize
the
nicely
rounded
fulsome
palate
this
beer
really
hits
all
the
spots
in
your
mouth
mouthfeel
is
excellent
carbonation
is
full
but
not
harsh
hop
oils
present
but
purely
balancing
and
the
malts
tasty
overall
this
is
quite
a
well
done
dubbel
in
the
thicker
richer
style
d
a
very
good
beer
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
just
not
necessarily
in
large
amounts
appearance
is
a
dark
red
amber
in
color
with
a
thick
head
smell
has
the
dark
fruits
and
honey
taste
seems
a
bit
dulled
for
the
style
yet
still
complex
with
the
dark
fruits
malts
spice
and
the
alchohol
seems
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
a
crisp
viscous
medium
not
the
best
ive
tried
thus
far
but
also
not
one
to
pass
up
to
campare
one
to
another
drink
i
dont
really
think
that
i
would
go
past
one
bottle
of
this
but
that
one
bottle
is
very
gratifying
notes
excellent
brew
and
something
to
look
forward
to
purchasing
a
delight
to
drink
and
a
sadness
to
see
it
all
gone
a
lot
of
character
to
this
one
and
quite
a
treat
there
is
a
nice
warmth
from
the
abv
but
this
one
is
doesnt
taste
boozy
like
it
smells
a
fine
brew
very
nice
beer
i
find
dubbels
as
a
style
somewhat
boring
but
this
one
packed
a
good
amount
of
flavor
the
maredsous
10
is
better
but
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
line
d
pretty
good
something
i
could
have
a
few
of
id
recommended
it
to
anyone
who
might
be
a
fan
of
the
heavier
darker
malty
beers
drinkability
this
brew
hides
the
strength
well
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
absolutely
in
the
rarer
former
camp
very
well
done
made
by
the
same
brewery
as
duvel
this
poured
a
dark
burgundy
color
with
a
slight
amount
of
white
head
it
smelled
like
oak
and
raisins
mixed
with
malt
and
alcohol
it
had
a
very
clean
and
well
balanced
flavor
that
mixed
prunes
with
cultured
yeast
and
floral
hops
it
was
watery
with
slight
carbonation
and
it
had
a
sweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
unique
and
refreshing
beer
and
confirms
my
high
opinion
of
belgian
darks
fruity
smell
and
taste
with
a
strong
maltalcohol
finish
the
alcohol
taste
took
away
from
the
drinkability
some
i
always
look
forward
to
having
the
onei
dont
want
to
make
it
mundane
pair
this
brew
with
some
extra
sharp
cheddar
cheese
and
some
of
that
malty
sweetness
thats
lacking
really
pops
out
much
more
after
a
mouthful
of
this
the
mouth
feel
was
bitter
on
the
finish
fairly
thin
and
stayed
with
you
for
a
while
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
dubbels
i
have
tried
it
comes
recommended
for
sure
d
a
bit
different
but
not
terrible
price
was
nice
too
ill
still
probably
stick
with
others
but
hey
ya
never
know
when
ill
feel
a
little
squirrelly
this
was
the
beer
that
opened
my
eyes
to
the
world
of
belgian
ales
and
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
a
maredsous
hangover
for
me
is
not
something
to
be
ashamed
of
kudos
to
the
drunken
monks
at
maredsous
abbey
this
one
is
a
winner
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
of
its
style
wellbalanced
and
easy
going
down
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
good
nonetheless
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
i
couldnt
see
having
too
many
in
one
sitting
d
definitely
wanted
more
disappointed
i
did
not
order
this
bad
boy
first
much
better
out
of
the
tap
versus
the
bottle
though
with
belgians
i
usually
give
bottles
the
nod
over
the
tap
d
good
but
damn
its
strong
a
wonderfully
complex
and
rich
dubbel
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
a
pleasure
to
sip
on
id
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
after
a
friend
recommended
it
wasnt
disappointed
good
dubbel
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
really
only
apparent
in
the
nose
i
could
taste
it
and
im
barely
feeling
it
this
is
a
lovely
dubbel
with
great
character
d
i
enjoy
dubbels
from
time
to
time
and
this
is
a
good
one
enjoy
the
taste
is
quite
nice
with
caramel
raisen
or
prune
a
tad
sour
but
in
a
good
way
nice
carbonation
and
a
medium
wet
finish
this
is
a
truly
premium
beer
and
i
will
keep
this
on
my
list
will
try
again

the

its

i

i
can
tell
that
this

the

is
a

really
detracts

beyond

there
isnt

going

with
the
flavors
of

and
yet
its
damn
solid
indeed
for
a
dubbel
its
downright
fairly
sessionableparticularly
since
its
mouthfeel
isnt

sticky
for
its

all

not
incredible

credibly

and
the
alcohol
is
a

more
present
than
i
would
like
but
this
is
a
solid
and
well
brewed
beer
o
good
but
lacks
the
depth
complexity
and
balance
of
a
fine
belgian
dubbel
overall
i
like
it
o
a
very
tasty
dubbel
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
one
the
belgian
yeast
really
makes
it
pop
try
a
pint
despite
a
really
solid
cool
smell
and
a
wonderful
look
and
pour
straight
to
ales
dubbel
is
a
bit
fruitier
than
i
was
expecting
its
certainly
not
bad
but
not
necessarily
my
preferred
taste
i
suspect
their
ipas
are
so
prolific
and
popular
for
a
reason
straight
to
ale
might
just
be
a
brewery
more
geared
toward
american
ipas
like
monkeynaut
or
snakehandler
which
are
both
highly
recommended
o
a
nice
dubbel
enjoyable
to
drink
not
the
best
in
the
group
but
a
solid
choice
especially
for
a
local
brew
o
overall
a
little
to
sweet
not
as
creamy
as
i
like
and
heavyhanded
on
the
candy
o
the
sometimesspiciness
is
nice
but
the
fruit
is
a
bit
too
sour
and
the
flavours
are
a
bit
too
subdued
not
recommended
but
worth
a
try
i
am
having
a
hard
time
believing
i
am
the
first
to
review
this
one
but
its
the
only
dubbel
i
see
by
this
brewery
and
the
menu
cleary
said
straight
to
ale
belgian
dubble
so
it
was
a
great
interpretation
from
a
small
craft
brewery
on
a
dubbel
a
nice
dark
copper
with
a
thick
white
head
that
faded
fast
but
left
nice

the
smell
had
faint
belgian
yeast
on
top
of
a
caramel
and
honey
toned
backbone
with
some
spicy
elements
a
bit
of
a
watered
down
version
on
the
taste
for
the
style
but
very
drinkable
unmistakable
on
the
belgian
yeast
profiles
with
spicy
and
fruity
characters
coming
through
a
caramel
backbone
with
hints
of
cocoa
and
cinamon

good

to
down

in

very

crafted
beer
o
overall
this
was
an
excellent
local
dubbel
it
was
not
revolutionary
or
anything
but
it
hit
the
spot
o
so
proud
to
see
a
brewery
in
gr
making
belgian
style
beers
and
doing
it
well
this
is
another
great
beer
from
brewery
vivant
not
the
best
dubbel
you
can
get
in
the
us
but
for
a
truly
local
brewery
this
is
pretty
damn
good
feel

carbonation
is
lively
perhaps
too
lively
i
am
surprised
that
bv
did
not
have
better
quality
control

their
outgoing
product
perhaps
the
experience
of
a
costly
recall
caused
bv
to
reevaluate
their
quality
control

when

really

was

carbonation
seemed
differant
than
other
beers
i
have
drank
when
first
hitting
my
palate
the
flavor
was
ok
but
it
ended
up
having
a
musty
sour
taste
perhaps
i
got
an
old
can
but
i
think
the
beer
went

immensely
refreshing
and
drinkable
wish
this
were
available
to
me
in
ohio
the
flavor
just
hurts
the
overall
beer
here
off
flavors
abound
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
here
i
rarely
drainpour
beer
but
this
one
is
getting
that
treatment
fresh
purple
raisins
soaked
in
white
grape
juice
the
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
garnetbrown
with
a
slightly
cloudy
haze
swirl
the
last
two
ounces
and
pour
into
the
glass
to
accentuate
the
yeast
character
the
beer
is
a
lean
easy
drinker
with
a
great
saisonlike
lemon
and
ester
character
that
is
amped
up
by
a
healthy
dose
of
dark
fruit
notes
from
either
specialb
malt
or
dark
candi
sugar
really
enjoying
this
one
i
tend
to
think
of
it
as
a
fall
version
of
a
saison
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
being
belgian
i
was
expecting
a
funk
a
tartness
some
sort
of
weird
twist
i
didnt
really
get
that
solitude
is
definitely
a
solid
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
vivant
im
not
sure
how
long
this
can
was
sitting
since
theres
no
canning
date
but
that
may
explain
why
i
dont
get
many
of
those
belgian
characteristics
in
this
beer
i
recommend
it
aroma
taste
a
very
interesting
beer
contains
chocolate
and
nutty
notes
mixed
with
dark
fruits
the
way
the
chocolate
and
nutty
flavors
mashed
with
the
raisin
and
plum
flavors
was
quite
delightful
after
tasting
the
solitude
from
brewery
vivant
i
realized
it
did
not
fit
my
specific
flavor
profile
or
taste
bud
selection
the
beer
had
a
great
dark
color
that
resembled
a
coco
or
chocolate
brown
the
smell
to
me
was
very
unpleasant
and
almost
musty
the
flavor
was
also
musty
and
in
my
opinion
sour
i
think
that
many
darker
beer
drinkers
would
appreciate
this
beer
for
its
fullbodied
dark
flavor
but
it
unfortunately
did
not
fit
my
specific
pallet
solitude
pours
out
a
brown
color
with
a
massive
head
even
with
a
slow
pour
the
aroma
is
sweet
malty
and
slightly
sour
with
some
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
very
good
offering
a
bit
of
sugary
yet
dark
fruit
based
sweetness
over
a
slightly
tart
base
yeast
imparts
just
a
bit
of
spiciness
very
well
composed
and
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
gently
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
belgianstyle
beers
ive
had
from
the
states
it
stays
away
from
the
pitfalls
of
either
too
much
spicy
yeast
flavors
or
too
much
candi
sugar
that
too
many
american
brewers
of
belgian
styles
fall
into
o
this
beer
is
pretty
light
in
flavor
with
the
tartness
of
their
house
yeast
that
i
just
care
for
there
is
not
much
malt
flavor
or
yeasty
esters
that
make
a
good
dubble
but
more
than
that
it
just
has
a
lot
of
off
flavors
regardless
of
what
style
you
want
to
label
it
16oz

by

thanks
to

for

up

you
spelunky
for
your
addictiveness
and
pain
anyway
this

the

comprises

minus

thankfully
plus
some
light
bread
and
plus

carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
little
belgian
deal
nothing
spectacular
but
a
welcome
sight
in
a
can
round
here
dark
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
some
translucencethis
smelled
fairly
light
all
things
considered
but
the
taste
is
dark
malt
plums
raisins
tart
a
touch
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
sweet
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
in
its
class
o
so
far
i
am
really
liking
what
i
am
seeing
from
vivant
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
belgian
dark
ale
looking
forward
to
trying
out
their
other
beers
for
sure
o
the
nose
was
nice
but
the
taste
was
a
slight
let
down
i
was
expecting
a
fully
body
and
more
dark
fruit
flavors
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
its
not
overly
complex
for
a
belgian
dark
but
still
solid
dark
brown
almost
purplish
with
a
tanbeige
head
fluffy
retention
and
some
pretty
thick
lacing
nose
has
a
whole
load
of
belgian
yeast
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
an
herbal
note
a
bit
earthy
perhaps
a
bit
of
chalk
tastes
of
dark
fruit
a
bit
dateypruney
grape
juice
dry
earthy
some
metal
and
again
a
bit
chalky
yeast
in
the
finish
medium
body
but
a
bit
on
the
thinner
side
medium
low
carb
an
ok
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
this
beer
is
a
good
candidate
for
when
you
want
a
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
your
not
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppy
beer
its
meant
to
be
a
session
ale
no
doubt
overall
this
is
a
pretty
boring
beer
not
bad
for
what
it
is
trying
to
be
but
i
definitely
didnt
find
anything
that
would
make
me
come
back
for
more
m
very
nice
mouthfeel
with
good
roasted
malt
up
front
and
wellbalanced
hop
finish
a
bit
on
thinner
side
of
an
abbey
ale
but
too
off
creamy
texture
d
a
passable
usmade
belgian
dark
ale
but
suffers
from
some
problems
in
the
finish
hopefully
they
can
tweak
the
recipe
a
bit
so
that
the
taste
matches
the
smell
better
again
very
weird
drinking
a
belgianstyle
beer
from
a
tallboy
not
very
complex
but
not
too
bad
d
and
o
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
going
on
here
it
has
some
good
malt
sweetness
but
kind
of
lacks
depth
easy
drinking
and
another
quality
michigan
brew
yet
just
falls
short
the
cpj
thanks
surlytheduff
for
the
opportunity
this
is
a
very
good
brew
as
this
beer
is
from
the
nearby
metropolis
of
grand
rapids
mi
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
i
tasted
lots
of
malty
sweetness
and
raisins
neither
of
these
flavors
was
overbearing
and
there
is
a
good
balance
among
all
the
different
elements
head
was
foamy
and
quickly
dissipated
leaving
behind
some
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
again
poured
from
the
can
into
a
tulip
a
full
finger
of
tan
bubbly
head
quickly
settles
onto
a
burnt
brown
body
with
hints
of
red
around
the
edges
the
nose
consists
of
bready
malts
spice
maybe
clove
raisins
and
a
little
roasted
smokieness
taste
is
very
sweet
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
spice
the
smoke
really
comes
out
on
the
backend
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
and
watery
lacks
carbonation
but
goes
down
easy
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
better
as
it
warms
brings
out
tobacco
and
smoke
and
probably
just
as
good
from
the
can
as
it
is
in
a
glass
o
overall
this
beer
from
brewery
vivant
is
a
lot
better
than
some
of
the
other
beers
that
ive
had
from
them
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
there
top
ones
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
probably
the
most
belgian
of
the
three
brewery
vivant
beers
i
had
too
bad
i
did
not
find
the
taste
to
my
liking
roasted
malts
and
coffee
bitterness
up
front
roasted
coffee
flavor
carries
through
as
plummy
malts
and
sweetish
sugar
fills
out
the
palate
notes
of
chocolate
smoke
tobacco
and
earthy
mineraly
peat
near
the
finish
spicy
roasted
bitterness
lingers
moderate
body
with
a
slightly
bubbly
feel
could
use
a
little
more
sweet
plummy
maltiness
for
balance
as
its
a
bit
roasty
still
not
bad
dark
brown
color
with
this
tin
wispy
head
of
off
white
that
capped
the
top
only
for
a
slight
time
offering
little
in
the
way
of
side
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malts
light
smoke
and
hints
of
chocolate
nice
and
warming
but
lacked
the
punch
i
was
looking
for
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
not
bad
at
all
had
all
the
right
markers
there
with
light
peat
lots
of
chocolate
deep
roasted
profile
just
too
light
for
me
to
be
honest
thin
feel
all
in
all
this
is
an
interesting
and
impressive
brew
it
took
me
a
while
to
warm
up
to
the
characteristics
of
this
garnet
hued
gem
but
once
i
did
wow
impressive
interesting
and
different
definitely
wouldnt
turn
down
another
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
middle
but
fills
out
at
the
finish
a
nice
beer
o
a
good
beer
and
one
that
is
very
drinkable
however
it
just
seems
a
little
weak
in
all
categories
im
not
looking
for
this
beer
to
be
a
monster
but
i
also
shouldnt
have
to
search
for
the
aroma
and
just
as
the
flavor
presents
itself
it
just
falls
off
a
cliff
with
that
i
did
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
and
id
definitely
have
another
overall
this
is
another
vivant
beer
that
comes
off
as
very
hohum
i
really
want
to
visit
the
brewery
and
see
what
these
beers
are
like
on
tap
but
judging
from
the
cans
it
seems
that
they
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
if
they
want
to
be
a
quality
belgian
style
brewery
brewery
vivant
did
a
pretty
nice
job
with
solitude
its
a
pretty
solid
release
allaround
it
could
be
improved
with
a
stronger
nose
and
more
of
a
belgian
yeast
presence
but
its
pretty
good
as
it
is
for
a
recent
upstart
brewery
vivant
is
showing
some
promise
keep
it
up
guys
color
me
impressed
dubbels
are
one
of
my
very
favorite
styles
and
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
on
this
website
i
was
a
little
skeptical
so
i
didnt
buy
a
4pack
i
will
gladly
go
back
and
get
a
few
4packs
my
only
critique
would
be
that
the
body
is
a
little
thin
perhaps
if
they
adjusted
their
mash
temp
up
a
few
degrees
they
could
improve
that
overall
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
beer
this
is
my
first
bda
i
usually
go
for
the
bsdas
but
i
really
like
how
this
is
a
little
lighter
and
more
drinkable
version
that
still
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
makes
for
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
cool
summer
night
i
thought
this
beer
was
highly
drinkable
it
was
flavorful
easy
to
drink
and
the
body
was
lighter
if
i
had
another
one
i
would
drink
it
a
four
pack
would
be
great
to
take
to
a
bonfire
lots
of
good
flavor
but
it
wont
fill
you
up
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
the
combination
of
mildly
roasted
malts
and
belgian
yeast
was
really
nice
and
it
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
the
color
was
nice
but
it
lacked
having
a
nice
head
which
most
belgians
usually
do
i
will
for
sure
be
buying
this
again
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
pretty
much
anyone
you
got
love
a
well
done
belgian
style
beer
in
a
can
its
just
so
wrong
its
right
i
really
like
the
fact
this
comes
in
pint
cans
makes
itls
easy
to
take
outdoors
with
me
and
you
just
dont
see
belgians
in
cans
there
is
enough
traditional
belgians
in
oddly
shaped
small
bottles
bring
on
the
pint
cans
this
made
for
both
a
good
first
impression
of
this
brewery
and
of
the
belgian
dark
ale
style
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
and
more
of
this
style
good
first
impression
for
brewery
vivant
you
can
bet
i
will
be
back
for
more
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
not
awful
but
not
really
leaving
me
wanting
more
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
darker
belgian
ale
will
finish
the
few
i
have
but
would
probably
never
seek
out
again
the
crack
glug
in
this
instance
was
heavenly
producing
two
rocky
fingers
of
deeptan
head
with
moderate
retention
the
inherent
carbonation
allowed
the
head
to
lead
a
rich
full
life
before
moving
on
into
the
atmosphere
the
color
was
more
truth
in
advertising
although
i
might
have
said
garnet
or
ruby
as
opposed
to
mahogany
shower
or
bathe
only
occasionally
i
found
it
difficult
to
get
past
the
unpeasant
cigarettelike
flavor
grpunkjun
24
o
another
excellent
beer
from
st
bernardus
just
okay
three
more
words
serving
type
bottle
the
dubbel
almost
as
good
as
their
abt
12
almost
great
nose
smooth
finish
silky
mouthfeel
like
zero
aftertaste
a
belgian
great
dubbel
no
complaints
great
beer
final
thoughts
well
after
a
lacklustre
start
this
beer
pulled
itself
together
and
produced
a
genuinely
great
experience
scoring
in
my
eyes
where
it
counts
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
st
bernardus
beer
ive
had
thus
far
its
a
little
heavy
but
this
is
a
beer
you
save
for
a
special
occasion
two
thumbs
up
o
fantastic
brew
allaround
even
if
it
lacks
a
few
things
mainly
that
yeasty
pop
that
id
compare
to
almost
a
pizza
crust
that
some
dubbels
have
this
one
doesnt
so
its
very
sweet
and
would
definitely
be
an
easy
brew
for
the
abbey
ale
novice
to
get
behind
unless
they
hate
sugar
hard
not
to
like
and
way
too
easy
to
drink
i
could
chug
this
brew
its
so
light
and
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
trappiste
ales
that
is
as
good
as
the
best
quads
substantial
flavor
profile
character
my
favorite
of
the
st
bernardus
mixed
pack
so
far
still
have
the
abt
12
left
great
beer
more
like
a
flemish
sour
ale
one
of
my
all
time
favs
as
close
to
perfect
as
a
beer
can
be
flavors
flavors
flavors
o
holy
shnoikies
this
is
good
so
much
interesting
stuff
going
on
final
grade
4
5
a
remarkable
a
grade
dubbels
have
never
been
one
of
my
favourite
abbey
styles
but
this
right
here
this
is
a
good
one
st
bernardus
prior
8
is
probably
the
more
traditional
of
the
two
dubbels
included
in
this
pack
with
a
more
maltforward
fruity
flavour
that
includes
more
residual
sweetness
and
yeasty
spice
then
can
be
found
in
the
pater
6
theyre
both
outstanding
beers
that
all
trappist
beer
fans
should
consider
musttries
and
even
though
i
consider
this
one
to
be
objectively
the
better
of
the
two
the
pater
6
is
still
more
tailored
toward
my
tastes
and
probably
my
favourite
o
a
taste
between
a
prior
6
and
an
abt
12
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
this
is
a
nice
and
crafted
dubbel
good
spice
and
fruity
notes
doesnt
blow
me
away
though
good
incorporation
of
the
alcohol
a
good
spicy
dubbel
that
drinks
well
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
its
a
go
to
beer
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
smells
so
nice
taste
is
great
banana
candy
fruits
its
got
it
all
o
good
beer
with
some
drawbacks
would
have
if
it
was
offered
to
me
o
a
superb
dubbel
that
is
full
of
tasty
flavours
enjoy
poured
a
deep
and
murky
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipated
quite
quickly
the
smell
is
mild
but
with
some
light
dark
fruit
and
some
spices
the
taste
is
a
little
more
robust
and
with
a
nice
light
sweetness
on
the
finish
there
is
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
on
the
finish
but
the
body
has
a
nice
weight
and
feel
to
it
on
tap
at
the
yard
house
in
denver
great
beer
what
you
expect
from
a
belgian
but
very
smooth
and
nice
to
drink
fairly
nutty
taste
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
producer
just
considerably
less
interesting
than
the
tripel
and
abt
12
medium

foamy

bready

in
the
taste
plus
some
earthy
herbal
notes
medium

soft
smooth

very
nice
dubbel
a
prime
example
overall
excellent
brew
between
a
dubbel
and
a
bdsa
with
good
complexity
and
full
of
flavors
and
spices
well
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
as
several
other
belgians
can
be
ages
well
recommended
overall
a
great
grapefruity
flavour
mixed
in
with
the
belgian
spice
mix
make
this
a
delicious
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
almost
refreshing
in
a
way
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
as
well
pours
dark
cloudy
brown
amber
with
a
large
beige
lasting
head
some
mild
lacing

as

feel
with
good

dry

yeast
and

notes
with
mildly
toasted
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
on
the
end
a
very
well
made
and
nicely
balanced
brew
prior
8
is
a
real
delight
i
dont
know
how
so
much
time
in
beer
has
gone
by
without
me
trying
this
ever
but
it
must
have
somehow
slipped
through
the
cracks
shame
on
me
because
this
is
a
real
beauty
a
classic
dubbel
in
style
maybe
the
classic
version
not
quite
as
legendary
as
their
quad
i
dont
reckon
but
its
there
in
quality
dark
muddy
amber
colored
brew
hazy
with
yeast
sediment
and
a
speckled
off
white
head
thick
and
full
of
tiny
bubbles
that
keep
on
holding
up
notes
of
dried
fruit
dominate
here
raisins
and
plums
both
come
to
mind
even
figs
and
molasses
the
additional
sugar
here
is
super
raw
and
not
all
the
way
fermented
out
by
the
dusty
spicy
belgian
strain
not
a
ton
of
lingering
sweetness
appropriate
levels
for
the
style
but
there
is
a
real
richness
created
in
the
texture
of
this
beer
a
long
experience
yeast
and
grain
driven
equally
but
showing
a
higher
level
of
refinement
than
even
the
offerings
from
other
belgian
monastic
types
lighter
in
body
than
the
quad
but
still
big
maybe
a
bit
more
drinkable
the
fruit
tones
are
awesome
and
permanent
this
is
a
memorable
brew
drinking
well
easier
than
8
abv
worth
double
what
they
ask
for
it
in
my
opinion
very
good
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
quite
clear
with
lots
of
carbonation
a
nice
beige
head
forms
but
turns
into
spotty
lacing
barely
covering
the
chalice
very
fragrant
with
lots
of
fruit
such
as
figs
and
raisins
followed
up
by
bready
aromas
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
despite
its
sweetness
a
touch
of
bitter
is
present
making
this
a
very
refreshing
brew
the
taste
follows
through
on
the
nose
there
are
other
many
other
dubbels
but
this
is
a
solid
example
that
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
pass
up
overall
great
dubbel
that
didnt
disappoint
feel
medium
body
proper
carbonation
overall
not
too
bad
but
its
hard
for
me
to
get
excited
about
this
style
pretty
much
textbook
but
missing
lots
of
wow
factor
although
not
visually
appealing
this
dubbel
is
redeemed
by
the
overall
good
taste
and
palate
it
is
slightly
sweet
but
never
too
sweet
as
dates
often
are
overall
a
very
pleasant
brew
one
of
two
regular
dubbel
offerings
from
st
bernardus
single
bottle
snagged
from
a
mixed
6pack
and
poured
into
a
goblet
a
murky
light
cola
brown
brew
with
a
large
beige
head
aroma
is
intensely
spicy
and
fruity
but
with
a
rum
and
raisin
meets
chocolate
malt
undertone
smells
a
bit
darker
than
some
other
dubbels
but
with
a
pleasant
rock
candy
sweetness
this
translate
well
to
the
palate
and
i
am
enjoying
where
this
particular
belgian
is
going
brown
bread
clove
oil
perhaps
some
dried
apricot
or
papaya
and
a
unique
note
that
recalls
chocolate
macaroon
remains
only
semisweet
however
with
the
chocolate
coconut
and
colalike
brown
spice
flavors
remaining
on
the
dark
side
of
the
ledger
as
opposed
to
the
cloyingly
sweet
rather
brisk
carbonation
and
the
body
is
a
hair
heavier
than
other
dubbels
yet
the
drinkability
remains
high
like
chimay
red
finishes
on
the
dry
side
as
well
but
with
some
lingering
vanilla
and
dry
chocolate
wafer
notes
i
like
this
beer
as
a
bridge
between
the
lighterbodied
dubbels
and
some
of
the
heavier
belgian
dark
ales
great
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
an
impressive
dubbel
nice
aromas
and
flavors
with
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
o
refreshing
and
fruity
dubbel
highly
drinkable
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
highly
carbonated
tan
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
disappointing
as
there
really
wasnt
much
complexity
and
flavor
i
expect
from
belgian
beers
this
was
light
bodied
which
could
be
considered
good
to
some
but
for
the
style
im
expecting
a
fuller
beer
the
taste
i
did
get
was
a
little
bit
a
chocolate
and
slight
bit
of
dark
fruits
overall
this
is
an
solid
beer
but
i
wouldnt
take

a

thats
not

sweet
my
beer
guru
invited
me
over
to
split
a
few
beers
and
rolled
out
this
one
wow
great
looking
and
smelling
beer
with
an
even
better
taste
hard
to
be
critical
but
maybe
a
little
thin
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
one
i
hope
to
revisit
o
did
i
pour
it
wrong
did
i
get
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
what
is
with
all
this
yeast
like
whoa
otherwise
this
is
an
excellent
dubbel
with
a
subdued
character
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
i
was
impressed
by
the
spiciness
provided
by
the
yeast
that
said
i
apparently
got
an
ounce
of
yeast
in
my
330ml
oanother
great
dubbel
by
st
bernardus
o
only
slight
flaw
that
i
found
was
on
the
feel
and
that
may
be
fixable
i
have
had
some
truly
delicious
dubbels
lately
and
they
are
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
certainly
right
up
there
with
the
finest
examples
a
terrific
dubbel
definitely
preferable
to
the
prior
8
offering
it
has
more
of
a
malt
presence
added
sweetness
and
a
richer
flavor
definitely
recommended
for
those
who
enjoy
dark
belgian
strong
ales
in
the
abbey
style
peace
o
pretty
good
definitely
not
their
best
or
second
best
but
worth
a
try
i
suggest
the
small
bottles
unless
you
really
like
the
style
a

overall
fantastic
another

i
like
drinking
this
one
my
band
practice
its
a
fun
social
beer
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
just
more
subtle
with
a
tempered
personality
satisfying
and
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
more
solid
examples

a

that
faded
quickly
into
nothing

a
spacey

probably
however
a

once
o
very
easy
drinking
abbey
ale
which
is
my
favorite
style
in
belgians
besides
trippels
and
quads
perhaps
due
to
its
age
it
may
be
maltier
than
intended
but
as
it
appears
to
have
been
bottle
conditioned
one
might
expect
the
yeast
to
have
asserted
itself
more
as
well
only
price
puts
ommegangs
abbey
ale
and
sierra
nevadas
ovila
ahead
of
it
the
next
time
i
want
a
good
brew
of
this
style
2013
vintage
osmooth
and
great
flavor
solid
ale
another
outstanding
beer
after
abt
12
which
is
one
of
my
fave
beers
ever
not
as
strong
but
still
a
8
this
is
a
typical
abbey
ale
looks
dark
red
and
cloudly
abundant
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
strong
malt
flavors
with
some
sweet
perhaps
caramel
especially
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
me
perhaps
i
didnt
pour
it
correctly
but
the
foam
makes
me
thing
otherwise
this
beer
gives
its
best
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
o
stable
and
solid
albeit
a
wee
bit
on
the
anonymous
side
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
o
a
very
wellmade
abbey
style
dubbel
very
complex
spot
on
nothing
to
criticize
just
a
damn
good
beer
overall
a
little
sour
at
the
end
and
i
prefer
sweet
big
and
boozy
nice
old
feel
to
the
taste
but
just
a
little
stong
with
that
combined
with
the
slightly
sour
taste
robs
this
of
a
great
rating
overall
solid
very
good
beer
i
think
at
the
moment
westmalle
dubbel
gets
the
win
over
this
beer
but
its
close
definitely
worth
a
try
not
cheap
but
no
belgians
are
st
bernardus
hits
the
mark
with
their
dubbel

only

this
is

was

find
this
as

is
about
my
favorite
beer
in

world
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
expectations
flavor
is
decent

i
dont
care
for

overall
i
would

again

chalice
overall
pretty
solid
dubbel
and
one
of
the
originals
that
has
stood
the
test
of
time
delicious
overall
a
top
notch
dubbel
from
a
top
notch
brewery
so
far
ive
had
the
triple
and
the
pierre
celis
witbier
and
between
the
3
they
are
all
over
810
this
one
tends
toward
sweetness
rather
than
bitterness
but
still
the
belgian
yeasts
manage
to
just
even
out
the
odds
definitely
a
slowdrinking
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
power
through
these
particularly
as
it
is
8
and
over
au130
a
case
2013
o
a
great
dubbel
complex
malt
flavor
with
spices
to
balance
o
good
stuff
but
i
think
i
like
pator
6
better
good
balance
of
flavors
and
a
huge
dose
of
spice
echoing
the
other
reviews
appearance
is
hazy
a
bit
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
mine
is
showing
virtually
no
lacing
smell
is
fabulous
fruits
love
it
taste
is
more
of
the
same
only
issue
is
a
distractingly
prickly
carbonation
that
id
like
to
see
muted
a
bit
waiting
a
bit
after
the
pour
helps
here
very
cheerful
will
have
to
try
more
from
them
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
with
good
flavors
and
good
marks
for
hitting
the
style
a
bit
spicier
than
i
expected
but
not
bad
pairs
well
with
dark
meat
sandwiches
and
smoked
sausagesand
bacon
lots
of
bacon
overall
like
a
dark
hefeweizen
with
great
sweet
belgian
candi
sugar
spices
and
vanilla
thrown
in
a
great
beer
that
is
not
necessarily
the
easiest
to
drink
nor
something
that
i
would
want
to
have
all
the
time
however
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
o
i
prefer
the
abt
12
duh
but
dont
enjoy
this
i
would
have
liked
the
sweet
dark
fruit
to
be
a
little
more
prominent
but
not
a
huge
deal
as
its
a
dubble
also
there
might
be
just
a
touch
too
much
alcohol
in
the
flavor
for
me
d
lives
up
to
high
standards
of
other
st
bernardus
offerings
a
rock
solid
dubbel
just
a
notch
down
from
my
favorites
in
the
style
category
easy
drinking
and
highly
enjoyable
i
can
recommend
without
hesitation
and
would
gladly
drink
again
myself
in
the
future
dark
brown
in
color
with
some
chestnut
highlights
when
it
catches
the
light
big
frothy
and
dense
tan
head
swirls
of
lacing
strong
notes
of
yeast
and
caramel
notes
of
spice
dark
fruit
molasses
dark
bread
nuts
alcohol
not
as
deep
and
complex
as
the
nose
bread
caramel
and
sugar
make
up
the
malt
profile
yeasty
spice
fruit
medium
bodied
solid
all
around
this
is
one
o
he
most
balanced
and
best
tasting
belgian
beers
ive
had
to
date
a
very
enjoyable
bready
beer
overall
a
wonderful
dubbel
with
perfectly
melded
but
very
in
your
face
flavors
every
st
bernardus
beer
i
have
had
has
blown
me
away
and
this
ones
proves
no
different
o
quite
a
curveball
but
not
in
a
bad
way
there
are
multiple
layers
to
this
beer
and
all
of
them
are
fascinating
has
to
be
one
of
the
pinnacles
for
the
style
dangerously
drinkable
also
but
just
so
well
rounded
and
complex
that
this
is
one
that
does
not
disappoint
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
a
cold
night
a
little
warming
alcohol
makes
this
very
enjoyable
o
i
love
it
i
could
drink
great
quantities
of
this
if
i
kept
it
on
hand
if
i
were
in
belgium
that
may
make
for
more
of
a
quandary
as
it
is
it
is
too
dear
and
expensive
to
keep
around
as
an
everyday
drinker
but
who
knows
maybe
i
will
enter
the
brotherhood
midlife
and
enjoy
the
finest
ales
the
abbeys
have
to
offer
on
a
more
regular
basis
m
creamy
just
like
the
head
goes
down
very
smooth
hides
the
alcohol
well
o
one
of
the
better
dubbels
out
there
but
its
hard
for
anything
to
compare
after
youve
had
westvleteren
8
especially
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
still
definitely
worth
a
try
though
overall
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
better
belgian
ales
available
i
got
this
bottle
at
my
local
establishment
by
itself
for
3
99
and
i
consider
that
a
steal
such
an
easy
drinker
that
any
belgian
fan
will
appreciate
damn
i
was
definitely
impressed
with
this
one
after
having
the
pater
6
my
hopes
werent
that
high
for
this
one
i
mean
its
just
a
stronger
version
right
wrong
this
beer
is
great
and
in
my
opinion
severely
underrated
a
supercomplex
compound
of
fruit
malt
sugar
musk
hops
spices
and
yeast
this
is
a
must
have
for
lovers
of
the
style
and
even
a
good
choice
to
convert
people
who
are
hesitant
beer
is
mediumheavy
in
body
with
medium
to
mediumlow
intensity
carbonation
that
feels
slightly
fizzy
upon
the
palate
this
quickly
foams
the
beer
though
and
the
beer
ends
up
softly
moving
across
the
palate
closes
rather
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
one
of
the
most
gorgeous
aromatic
and
tasty
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
overall
ahh
st
bernie
you
done
good
real
good
id
reach
for
this
in
almost
any
situation
place
mood
weather
or
company
overall
nice
beer
probably
would
sell
this
beer
in
my
pub
othis
brew
lacks
the
complexity
of
my
favorite
dubbels
but
it
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
old
world
style
with
big
sweetness
and
subtle
fruit
characteristics
the
appearance
is
archetypical
and
mouthfeel
is
great
this
brew
made
for
a
nice
sipper
on
a
cold
january
evening
and
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
good
stuff
i
forgot
which
one
was
more
revered
this
one
or
the
tripel
both
beers
that
ive
never
had
before
went
with
this
one
needless
to
say
i
gotta
go
back
and
get
that
tripel
singles
are
the
way
to
go
as
i
dont
need
the
gift
pack
because
i
already
have
the
glass
o
very
good
beer
much
more
flavor
than
the
6
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
really
was
hoping
to
like
this
beer
given
how
good
the
12
was
but
instead
i
am
beyond
unimpressed
this
being
only
4
months
old
could
be
a
factor
in
my
score
perhaps
at
612
months
this
might
work
out
the
kinks
and
become
a
good
bit
better
sadly
a
review
is
just
a
snap
shot
in
time
for
the
bottle
being
opened
i
wont
go
as
far
as
to
say
avoid
this
beer
as
this
isnt
a
style
i
seek
out
normally
but
i
wouldnt
go
in
with
high
expectations
overall
impression
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
its
packed
with
flavors
that
meld
together
very
nicely
its
sweet
and
smooth
and
the
aftertaste
is
absolutely
delightful
i
really
think
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
love
me
some
st
bernardus
o
wow
this
is
an
awesome
dubbel
complex
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
all
at
the
same
time
o
this
is
a
sure
hit
sweet
and
deeply
toasted
malts
in
both
the
scent
and
flavour
with
plenty
of
creaminess
with
a
solid
foundation
of
deep
dark
copper
in
the
glass
get
some
and
enjoy
very
solid
brew
overall
maybe
not
as
impressive
as
st
bernarduss
higher
gravity
brews
but
still
a
great
beer
will
visit
this
again
overall
a
really
great
belgian
dubbel
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
great
mix
of
yeast
spices
and
complex
fruit
esters
o
call
me
crazy
but
this
has
a
very
similar
taste
to
the
abt
12
o
highly
drinkable
and
packs
a
lot
of
diverse
flavor
without
losing
balance
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
most
anyone
o
a
decent
beer
but
honestly
i
am
a
bit
underwhelmed
here
deffiantly
would
take
a
rochefort
8
over
this
one
overall
4
0
very
good
to
excellent
beer
this
is
an
easydrinking
dubble
double
and
would
be
fantastic
as
a
heavy
session
beer
for
those
nights
when
you
do
not
have
to
work
the
next
day
not
the
best
dubble
in
the
world
but
definitely
not
one
to
refuse
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
dubbel
with
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
in
comparison
to
the
other
st
bernardus
products
i
give
the
nose
on
this
one
a
slight
edge
over
the
6
but
the
flavor
of
the
6
is
a
little
better
than
this
one
still
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
it
came
in
a
fourpack
sampler
from
st
bernardus
and
well
see
how
it
compares
to
its
abbey
brethren
the
entire
experience
is
pleasurable
not
too
fruity
not
too
sweet
the
belgians
were
beginning
to
wear
on
me
with
their
richness
just
the
right
amount
of
quaffness
and
quenching
in
this
i
definitely
need
to
get
back
to
the
belgian
pub
and
have
a
few
of
these
on
tap
again
o
overall
definitely
not
as
good
as
what
i
was
hoping
overall
a
superb
example
of
a
dubbel
highly
complex
and
very
well
rounded
oa
really
solid
offering
from
st
bernardus
as
expected
but
doesnt
have
the
flavor
as
the
12
i
know
it
shouldnt
compare
but
its
simply
a
lesser
version
of
the
12
overall
i
truly
enjoyed
this
brew
a
complex
but
well
balanced
brew
with
a
delicious
taste
and
aroma
though
not
amongst
my
favorite
belgians
its
an
easydrinking
belgian
unique
indeed
i
love
you
belgium
final
thoughts
this
is
a
dubbel
done
right
those
who
enjoy
the
style
should
really
appreciate
this
one
would
i
drink
it
again
its
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
ive
tried
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
light
beige
head
good
retention
on
a
hazy
amber
body
soapy
suddsy
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
vanilla
raisin
biscotti
fig
feint
chocolate
taste
closely
follows
the
aromas
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
for
8
delicious
in
every
way
shape
and
form
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
in
its
wake
the
aroma
brings
brown
bread
yeast
brown
sugar
though
the
aroma
is
not
sweet
per
se
light
spice
the
flavor
is
light
and
easy
minimal
alcohol
presence
bread
yeast
malt
light
spice
a
stellar
example
of
a
dubbel
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
quite
like
though
i
expected
a
bit
more
of
the
taste
and
it
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
especially
in
the
aftertaste
and
the
mouthfeel
delicious
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
and
to
try
their
other
brews
smells
and
tastes
of
raisin
bread
and
waffles
with
a
touch
of
molasses
sweetness
and
a
smear
of
figgy
jam
on
top
of
fresh
baked
muffins
im
thinking
that
it
is
probably
the
blend
of
medium
yeastiness
and
mediumlight
sweetness
with
just
a
little
whisper
of
pseudocinnamon
allspice
blend
in
the
background
that
gives
me
such
a
nostalgic
sensory
rush
of
hearty
breakfasts
full
of
baked
goods
and
i
really
enjoy
it
a
lot
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
good
lacing
the
aroma
moderate
to
heavy
malty
brown
sugar
raisin
plum
and
hoppy
flavor
moderateheavy
sweet
and
bitter
in
good
balance
mediumfull
body
syrupy
soft
carbonated
moderate
in
alcohol
o
definitely
a
high
quality
dubbel
but
didnt
blow
me
away
i
would
have
it
again
though
o
a
really
great
belgian
thats
exceptionally
balanced
between
spiciness
alcoholic
bite
sweet
fruity
flavor
and
that
distinctive
yeasty
foundation
its
flavorful
and
strong
without
being
totally
overpowering
an
overall
very
well
crafted
complex
and
interesting
beer
ive
had
dubbels
with
more
striking
flavors
this
one
is
more
about
balance
and
drinkability
what
a
great
dubbel
pours
slightly
darker
than
the
6
with
a
thicker
mouthfeel
small
off
white
head
heavy
prune
notes
and
carbonation
is
just
right
a
little
chocolate
more
dark
fruits
and
plums
just
a
hint
of
yeast
medium
mouthfeel
with
still
plenty
of
carbonation
more
good
stuff
by
st
bernardus
for
some
reason
as
i
sipped
this
i
couldnt
help
but
think
that
some
aspect
of
it
reminded
me
of
an
imperial
soupedup
version
of
celebrator
doppelbock
maybe
its
the
chocolate
or
candy
aspects
of
the
brew
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
o
maybe
i
have
been
spoiled
by
the
other
dubbels
i
have
had
but
this
one
doesnt
particularly
stand
out
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
im
not
sure
if
i
like
it
or
not
its
not
bad
and
i
do
enjoy
it
but
its
just
not
a
wow
moment
i
had
with
their
triple
so
its
def
not
their
best
overall
a
tasty
brew
but
in
comparison
to
its
bigger
brother
12
it
is
nothing
to
really
pine
for
for
the
dubbel
style
it
is
more
towards
the
top
of
the
line
but
not
the
best
out
there
at
least
in
my
opinion
pours
a
molasses
brown
with
a
two
finger
light
beige
head
the
head
remains
as
long
as
the
beer
significant
lacing
coats
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
dark
fruit
fig
and
dates
sweet
cream
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
rises
from
the
chalice
notes
of
sweet
malt
caramel
spice
bread
and
almond
can
be
found
thoughout
this
brew
mediumbodied
perfect
carbonation
creamy
velvet
on
the
palate
an
exceptional
dubbel
from
a
fantastic
brewery
o
this
brewery
never
ceases
to
amaze
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
very
well
balanced
and
warming
overall
a
powerfully
rich
beer
an
excellent
slow
sipping
nightcap
treat
overall
i
get
a
lot
of
caramel
but
well
in
balance
not
much
alcohol
or
hop
character

drinkable

mouth
feel
and
carbonation
are
very
nice
a
great
dubble
although
the
flavors
are
not
as
assertive
as
id
expect
id
still
be
happy
to
drink
this
any
time
taste
its
absolute
strongest
point
i
sipped
on
this
over
the
course
of
a
half
hour
and
savored
every
drop
of
it
i
like
to
start
these
out
a
little
colder
than
recommended
and
let
the
taste
gradually
enhance
as
it
goes
on
and
this
even
cold
had
a
very
nice
flavor
i
had
one
of
these
the
same
weekend
i
had
a
rochefort
8
and
while
this
is
the
minority
opinion
i
found
the
prior
8
exceedingly
more
tasteful
ive
had
the
st
b
quad
but
this
was
my
first
time
with
their
dubbel
and
this
is
now
my
favorite
dubbel
hands
down
o
a
very
good
beer
light
enough
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
evening
not
as
powerful
or
as
much
of
a
sensory
overload
as
12
sort
of
like
12
light
not
quite
as
much
flavor
and
not
as
full
bodied
but
the
flavor
and
fizzy
character
matches
you
can
tell
its
st
bernardus
overall
this
is
as
fine
a
dubbel
as
ive
had
and
one
worth
seeking
out
i
probably
enjoyed
it
more
than
any
of
the
other
st
bernardus
offerings
though
they
are
all
worthy
overall
a
great
beer
at
the
right
temp
warmth
brings
out
the
finish
and
mellows
the
mouth
feel
will
drink
again
damn
tasty
rich
complex
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
highly
recommended
for
me
this
one
was
just
amazing
though
i
may
have
a
bias
toward
this
type
of
beer
hugely
complex
and
a
lot
sweeter
than
its
big
brother
better
looking
too
i
only
wish
i
had
a
750ml
instead
of
on
11
2oz
bottle
o
a
pleasant
fruity
dubbel
good
stuff
from
these
guys
still
liked
abt
12
better
but
i
guess
its
just
a
different
beer
all
together
st
bernardus
prior
8
22
oz
bomber
a
good
belgian
dubbel
is
an
amazing
experience
the
prior
8
has
a
dark
caramel
color
and
the
big
head
as
is
common
with
the
st
bernardus
products
the
aroma
is
good
but
could
be
bigger
and
have
more
of
the
belgian
yeast
that
i
expect
out
of
a
belgian
beer
good
flavor
but
overpowering
in
a
raisin
flavor
note
lacking
the
big
rock
candy
flavor
that
ruins
some
dubbels
in
my
opinion
but
too
much
of
the
raisin
flavor
and
not
enough
complexity
not
enough
belgian
yeast
coming
through
but
i
did
not
swirl
the
yeast
in
so
that
may
be
my
fault
so
the
rating
is
good
but
i
was
expecting
more
o
not
easily
drinkable
with
a
nice
aftertaste
overall
an
outstanding
dubbel
possibly
my
favorite
wish
there
werent
so
many
chunks
but
in
the
end
a
minor
detraction
o
decent
dubbel
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
dubbel
but
a
good
representation
of
the
style
its
well
balanced
and
dangerously
drinkable
as
well
as
easily
obtainable
worth
trying
if
you
havent
750
ml
bottle
into
signature
chalice
no

dating
pours
cloudy
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fairly
dense
2

reduces
to
a
thin

hardly
any

the
finish

this
is
an
absolutely
mind
blowing
dubbel

super
smooth

hands
down
the
best
dubbel
i
have
ever
had
palate
is
tighter
than
nose
temperature
is
a
bit
cool
but
citrus
and
spices
show
themselves
the
beer
is
lively
and
fresh
and
youthful
just
a
hint
of
bitter
very
nicely
balanced
with
malty
richness
and
nuanced
power
the
beer
finishes
long
and
with
high
complexity
this
is
far
superior
to
the
pater
6
i
had
from
the
same
gift
set
great
beer
great
beer
notes
fresh
by
4122013
drank
282012
the
mouthfeel
leans
toward
lush
in
a
rich
carbonation
flowing
through
a
big
malty
backbone
but
carbonation
is
so
heavy
it
becomes
extremely
filling
both
smooth
and
crisp
i
understand
the
love
of
so
many
for
the
mouthfeel
but
if
the
carbonation
could
be
moderated
it
would
make
for
easier
drinking
served
in
a
branded
goblet
poured
a
dark
walnut
colour
two
fingers
of
clean
head
smells
robustly
malty
is
lightly
carbonated
slightly
sweet
not
too
heavy
and
sickly
finishes
slightly
pruney
a
good
showing
for
a
belgium
representative
of
the
style
without
the
sickly
sweetness
sometiems
present
no
strong
alcohol
overtones
overall
a
real
disappointment
not
sure
if
this
is
an
off
bottle
or
just
a
really
young
bottle
but
i
expected
much
more
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
other
st
bernadus
beers
i
have
had
12
6
tripel
and
wit
so
i
am
surprised
by
this
will
definitely
try
it
again
to
see
if
i
have
a
different
reaction
next
time
o
nice
combination
of
full
dark
flavors
paired
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
beautiful
appearance
makes
this
a
great
brew
dark
brown
in
the
pour
some
ruby
around
the
edges
fairly
thick
tan
head
with
some
dense
lacing
and
somewhat
thin
retention
but
its
persistent
nose
is
chockful
of
rich
dark
fruit
notes
loads
of
plums
and
the
like
caramelized
and
candied
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
gentle
vanilla
some
grapeiness
that
sits
well
in
the
background
caramel
toffee
and
more
sweet
dark
fruits
vanilla
is
right
there
again
and
dominates
the
profile
for
the
better
part
finishes
sweet
and
somewhat
sticky
mouthfeel
is
creamy
as
can
be
and
the
alcohol
is
invisible
super
smooth
and
as
close
as
can
be
to
perfect
for
the
style
overall
a
fantastic
surprise
didnt
see
the
dating
when
i
got
this
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
had
in
a
while
doesnt
stand
far
at
all
from
a
westy
8
o
very
nice
beer
well
balanced
and
with
good
amounts
of
complexity
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
as
i
have
been
impressed
with
every
beer
i
have
had
from
st
bernardus
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
get
many
times
and
each
time
i
think
i
appreciate
it
a
little
more
o
i
think
all
six
bottles
in
my
variety
pack
are
going
to
be
a
winner
3
down
3
to
go
id
pair
this
with
a
tuna
pate
on
crackers
o
solid
offering
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
again
or
recommend
to
someone
who
is
looking
for
an
entry
beer
into
belgians
o
a
very
good
dubbel
from
a
world
class
brewery
happy
to
have
found
it
on
draft
look
forward
to
having
it
again
opretty
good
not
the
best
of
the
style
above
average
but
nothing
special
pours
a
muddy
cloudy
light
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
scent
is
of
dark
fruits
and
spice
and
makes
up
for
the
less
than
beautiful
appearance
the
taste
is
much
fuller
than
i
expected
and
follows
the
scent
this
brew
was
nicely
carbonated
and
quite
viscious
at
the
same
time
i
would
not
hestitate
to
buy
this
one
again
tasty
o
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
not
my
favorite
from
them
nor
should
it
be
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
seek
it
out
if
you
enjoyed
the
abt
12
but
didnt
enjoy
the
price
doa
overall
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
i
think
its
a
bit
too
much
at
times
too
strong
but
its
very
tasty
just
the
same
a
humdinger
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
if
anything
it
might
be
a
tad
sweet
and
tangy
but
overall
i
found
it
very
tasty
and
satisfying
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
dubbel
that
is
exactly
was
a
classic
and
traditional
dubbel
should
be
this
beer
really
epitomizes
the
style
with
great
balance
and
some
nice
complexity
this
beer
was
really
drinkable
at
first
i
didnt
think
it
was
going
to
be
because
of
its
sweet
aroma
but
it
wasnt
that
sweet
in
the
flavor
it
went
down
very
smooth
and
had
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
if
i
wasnt
sharing
this
with
my
brother
i
dont
think
i
would
have
any
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
i
liked
pretty
much
everything
about
this
beer
it
is
just
about
everything
that
a
good
dubbel
should
be
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
high
amount
of
prickly
carbonation
it
wasnt
that
bad
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
prickly
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
mainly
for
special
occasions
its
got
good
flavor
with
some
good
drinkability
to
go
with
it
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
it
has
all
the
aspects
that
a
good
dubbel
should
have
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
celebrate
my
birthday
with
it
had
some
nice
complex
flavors
without
being
too
big
and
boozy
if
i
had
more
i
think
i
would
be
content
with
drinking
this
all
night
those
monks
really
have
this
style
down
and
this
beer
showcases
what
years
and
years
of
hard
work
can
do
this
is
the
best
dubbel
i
have
had
to
date
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
their
tripel
and
quad
are
like
o
well
done
could
be
my
favorite
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
with
a
medium
sized
head
lacing
on
the
surface
smell
is
strong
dark
fruit
plums
raisins
brown
sugar
taste
is
complex
with
fruit
notes
apples
caramel
bitterness
in
the
finish
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
pretty
easily
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
overall
this
is
a
great
dubbel
o
good
beer
but
a
little
thin
fairly
easy
drinking
overall
after
sampling
the
pater
6
back
to
back
with
this
beer
i
think
i
prefer
the
lighter
example
because
the
flavors
seem
more
balanced
and
lean
toward
the
toastier
bread
compared
to
this
example
that
is
kind
of
crossed
between
a
dubbel
and
a
quad
flavor
wise
dark
fruits
are
most
dominant
in
the
abt
12
while
this
is
a
good
beer
it
not
no
exponentially
better
than
the
lesser
abv
example
and
i
would
lean
toward
that
one
so
i
can
imbibe
in
more
of
it
if
you
want
a
more
flavorful
darker
belgian
beer
opt
for
the
12
over
this
8
notes
sourness
plays
a
big
part
here
there
is
a
slight
bitter
aspirin
taste
and
a
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
not
sure
if
i
would
want
to
drink
more
my
second
one
out
of
the
gift
pack
pours
a
dirty
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
smell
is
of
raisins
prunes
roasted
malt
and
spice
taste
is
right
on
with
the
nose
except
that
the
spice
is
more
present
in
the
flavor
has
a
some
what
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
with
a
dry
spicy
finish
not
liking
this
one
as
much
as
i
did
the
pater
6
of
course
its
good
its
st
bernadus
d
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
while
working
im
not
a
particular
fan
of
dubbles
but
i
would
never
turn
this
down
though
multiple
would
be
tough
for
those
are
more
accustomed
to
lighter
beers
overall
it
is
a
nice
beer
not
too
heavy
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
just
like
their
pater
6
is
doesnt
stack
up
at
all
to
their
abt
12
o
i
had
just
tried
the
pater
6
and
thought
it
was
excellent
and
was
hoping
this
would
be
the
same
but
a
tiny
bit
better
but
i
actually
prefer
the
6
having
said
that
its
a
great
brew
overall
a
good
beer
and
similar
to
the
6
but
it
seemed
to
impress
me
slightly
less
still
a
really
good
belgian
beer
would
enjoy
it
again
without
question
o
very
good
dubbel
i
like
this
dubbel
much
more
than
the
prior
6
it
is
interesting
how
different
the
two
actually
are
within
the
same
style
overall
this
is
a
true
winner
can
well
be
considered
a
definition
of
the
style
along
with
greats
like
westmalle
la
trappe
sterkens
and
ommegang
a
quintessential
belgian
dubbel
in
my
opinion
and
one
that
all
dubbels
should
be
rated
against
highly
recommended
a
nice
dubbel
a
little
too
brut
for
my
taste
but
still
a
worthwhile
visit
wonderful
example
of
belgian
dubbel
without
the
ass
kicking
abv
if
you
have
a
taste
for
something
belgian
on
a
lower
scale
grab
one
of
these
getting
more
for
those
occasions
overall
impression
im
a
huge
fan
of
all
other
st
bernardus
brews
but
this
one
falls
short
for
me
should
have
more
body
carbonation
complexity
richness
and
many
more
attributes
nonetheless
enjoyed
but
would
push
you
to
get
an
abt
12
or
pater
6
before
this
one
i
dont
think
i
can
count
how
many
times
ive
seen
this
beer
around
but
i
never
got
around
to
trying
it
always
opting
for
its
bigger
brother
12
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
st
bernardus
clear
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
retained
and
laced
well
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
sugars
with
notes
of
dried
fruits
taste
was
pretty
much
what
id
expect
from
a
dubbel
candi
sugar
and
caramel
lightly
toasted
bread
tones
of
dried
plums
and
raisins
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
a
bit
of
noticeable
booze
medium
mouthfeel
and
pleasantly
drinkable
overall
a
good
brew
that
was
a
good
representation
of
the
style
recommended
o

o
a
really
good
beer
easy

and
smooth
solid
flavor
profile
spot
on
prior
8
is
another
stellar
ale
from
brouwerij
st
bernardus
nv
overall
drinkability
flavorful
balanced
but
a
little
bland
if
you
pay
attention
there
are
a
lot
of
subtle
flavors
that
come
together
in
this
one
its
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
goblet
this
pours
a
hazy
yeast
filled
tea
color
with
a
small
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smells
are
of
grapes
and
dark
ripe
fruit
the
feel
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
the
taste
is
of
grape
fruit
malts
with
a
dry
finish
and
a
little
alcohol
burn
overall
pretty
good
but
the
10
is
better
its
been
established
in
other
reviews
that
im
highly
sensitive
to
candied
sugar
and
this
one
does
it
to
me
i
guess
i
like
this
more
on
tap
than
in
a
bottle
good
to
know
overall
a
really
nice
tasting
beer
complex
smooth
creamy
excellent
example
of
a
dubbel
o
this
is
a
great
beer
has
the
same
qualities
as
the
trappist
ales
without
the
noticeable
alcohol
despite
the
8
abv
o
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
nothing
was
overpowering
things
just
seemed
to
mesh
together
well
in
this
beer
this
is
a
really
great
beer
almost
like
a
more
drinkable
apt
12
though
the
two
have
distincly
different
tastes
great
dubble
either
way
that
is
hard
to
beat
with
the
lack
of
rochefort
around
these
parts
popped
the
cap
on
this
brew
and
the
bubbles
started
coming
right
up
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
magically
stopped
right
at
the
top
of
the
bottle
poured
this
one
slowly
into
a
wine
glass
it
came
out
as
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
down
the
glass
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
soft
earthy
and
had
a
light
spice
note
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
smooth
with
some
subtle
dark
fruit
flavors
and
brown
sugar
the
other
flavors
of
some
yeast
come
through
also
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
to
it
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
overall
its
a
brew
that
everyone
should
try
m
easy
to
drink
at
the
beginning
turns
a
little
difficult
at
the
end
because
of
the
bitterness
that
remains
a
long
time
making
a
good
ending
some
alcohol
remains
on
the
mouth
but
not
disgusting
o
this
beer
is
clearly
quality
if
i
have
one
qualm
with
it
it
is
that
it
is
almost
too
unassuming
the
flavors
are
developed
and
sophisticated
yet
sometimes
are
so
delicate
and
understated
that
they
border
on
anticlimactic
the
prior
8
consistently
dazzles
you
but
never
quite
delivers
that
knock
out
blow
d
another
home
run
by
st
bernardus
as
i
mentioned
a
slight
step
below
the
pater
6
but
a
fantastic
and
flavorful
dubbel
nonetheless
if
it
wasnt
for
the
8
0
abv
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
nicely
balanced
fullflavored
and
completely
easydrinking
very
tasty
and
not
too
sweet
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
probably
my
2nd
favorite
from
waton
topped
only
by
abt
12
a
must
try
o
not
bad
but
not
something
i
get
excited
over
o
a
damn
fine
beer
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
recommended
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
especially
as
it
warms
up
because
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
detectable
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
im
not
crazy
about
this
dubbel
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
dont
imagine
ill
be
buying
another
in
the
near
future
o
i
love
this
style
and
i
love
this
beer
this
is
a
classic
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
drink
this
all
the
time
because
it
never
gets
old
i
cant
remember
if
i
like
this
more
than
the
pater
6
but
the
alcohol
does
seem
to
come
out
a
lot
more
in
this
one
this
is
a
solid
dubbel
and
a
nobrainer
to
try
out
the
drink
of
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
not
overpowering
in
flavor
for
a
belgian
abbey
overall
nice
dubbel
but
can
not
compete
with
westvleteren
achel
and
rochefort
when
i
first
had
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
truly
excellent
upon
a
rereview
i
found
it
to
be
less
than
perfect
its
less
complex
than
some
others
tasty
nonetheless
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
i
generally
prefer
a
bit
more
bitter
flavors
but
with
food
i
think
this
one
ll
do
overall
a
very
good
brew
mellow
yet
complex
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
addition
of
cheese
and
onion
crisp
not
recommended
overall
i
expected
a
bit
more
though
its
still
a
very
good
beer
the
clove
taste
is
more
evident
than
i
would
like
this
and
the
pater
6
while
very
different
beers
dont
compare
with
the
quality
of
the
abt
12
look
for
the
12
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
belgianstyle
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
but
its
not
quite
as
outstanding
as
some
other
beers
from
st
bernardus
othis
is
a
wonderful
beer
its
quite
different
than
the
other
dubbels
ive
had
not
as
sweet
this
seems
to
have
a
different
flavor
profile
to
me
this
seems
to
be
more
complex
and
sophisticated
to
me
than
the
others
every
time
i
go
to
take
a
sip
i
get
excited
i
definitely
wont
mind
getting
this
again
its
quite
tasty
and
goes
down
very
easily
dr
hides
its
high
abv
quite
well
but
is
nothing
special
especially
by
belgian
standards
wonderful
but
average
if
that
makes
sense
very
well
priced
in
belgium
pours
mahagony
with
a
decent
head
into
a
chimay
chalice
initial
smell
and
taste
sour
and
cidery
thinking
im
going
to
drain
pour
after
i
finish
the
chalice
but
i
give
it
a
chance
and
allow
it
to
warm
maybe
served
a
little
too
cold
smell
plums
and
raisinsdisclaimer
i
have
a
bad
sense
of
smell
tastes
very
sweet
perfect
level
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
light
and
smooth
head
retention
is
minimal
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
most
likely
wouldnt
try
this
one
again
if
i
did
i
would
allow
it
to
warm
to
correct
temperature
first
o
great
beer
but
i
wish
the
alcohol
wasnt
so
noticeable
id
grab
the
6
first
the
beer
is
medium
brown
colored
with
a
tannish
head
the
beer
is
hazy
and
you
cannot
see
through
it
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
molasses
mixed
in
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
full
of
caramel
belgian
yeast
candy
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
grapeother
dark
fruit
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
and
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
medium
full
body
with
creamy
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
warmth
one
of
the
finest
dubbels
out
there
330
ml
bb

into
tulip
awesome
beer
truly
a
hallmark
of
the
style
simply
impeccable
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
and
incredibly
briskly
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
especially
for
the
abv
could
all
the
trappist
and
trappiststyle
beers
be
this
good
have
i
been
writing
off
belgian
beers
entirely
due
to
american
breweries
poor
heavyhanded
use
of
belgian
yeast
in
styles
where
it
doesnt
belong
its
too
early
to
call
that
for
sure
but
this
is
a
great
beer
suddenly
im
looking
forward
to
my
tour
of
belgian
beers
medium
and
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
high
level
of
carbonation
that
works
well
excellent
brew
othis
is
a
solid
brew
from
st
bernardus
but
im
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
o
a
great
belgian
dark
ale
the
complexity
and
nuance
is
there
huge
toasted
malts
great
yeast
esters
o
a
great
dubbel
rich
and
very
enjoyable
something
to
take
your
time
with
and
enjoy
drinkability
its
a
great
dubbel
one
of
the
best
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
new
belgian
this
was
from
st
bernardus
so
i
was
hopeful
when
i
bought
it
and
it
was
not
their
best
but
it
did
not
disappoint
prior
8
is
somewhat
darker
than
abt
12
but
has
the
same
outstanding
characteristics
of
the
top
tier
belgians
the
appearance
was
dark
with
a
good
head
smell
was
underwhelming
but
fruity
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
taste
with
sweet
overtones
and
not
overwhelming
yeast
and
some
mild
bitter
and
heres
to
my
daughter
michelle
rachel
may
you
live
as
long
as
you
want
and
never
want
as
long
as
you
live
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
no
real
taste
of
alcohol
finishes
a
little
dry
i
could
drink
this
again
easily
another
great
beer
from
st
bernardus
with
plenty
of
authentic
character
for
the
senses
o
a
nice
choice
but
maybe
lacking
some
bigger
flavors
nice
and
smooth
but
a
milder
dubbel
very
drinkable
super
smooth
and
delicious
i
love
the
style
and
this
is
simply
a
good
example
of
it
if
this
was
more
widely
distributed
in
my
area
it
would
probably
be
in
heavy
rotation
in
the
beer
refrigerator
this
is
an
excellent
beer
well
done
and
well
made
though
lighter
in
the
alcohol
it
tastes
almost
like
a
quadruple
its
a
perfect
beer
to
have
if
you
want
the
fullness
of
a
quad
without
the
higher
alcohol
levels
that
accompany
it
brown
with
ruby
red
edges
and
a
dense
and
rolling
tan
head
that
has
staying
power
malts
and
dark
fruit
to
the
nose
with
a
slightly
metallic
edge
tastes
of
plums
cherries
brown
sugar
taffy
cinnamon
and
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
very
end
everything
is
very
well
blended
with
no
intrusions
smooth
with
a
subtle
graininess
going
down
and
a
little
syrupy
on
the
lips
after
a
bit
good
brew
from
a
great
brewery
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
with
some
chalkiness
at
times
and
a
finish
that
is
awkwardly
watery
chalky
and
slightly
bitter
at
the
same
time
drinkability
is
shoddier
than
expected
as
the
yeast
is
just
way
too
strong
at
the
start
and
the
finish
as
just
mentioned
is
weird
abv
is
not
utilized
in
the
best
way
possible
this
doesnt
mean
it
has
to
be
hidden
it
just
means
the
strength
is
too
much
for
this
beer
after
having
abt
12
and
tripel
from
these
guys
i
expected
a
lot
more
but
i
guess
everything
is
not
going
to
be
to
my
taste
d
umm
not
really
seeing
the
big
draw
to
this
one
its
good
but
its
nothing
special
it
does
not
compare
to
abt
12
or
really
anything
i
have
had
from
them
maybe
i
just
dont
like
dubbels
are
much
as
tripels
and
quads
idk
but
not
the
best
and
not
the
worst
right
in
the
middle
overall
a
superb
tasting
abbey
ale
with
a
great
drinkability
which
did
a
great
job
of
hiding
the
high
abv
pours
an
opaque
super
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
very
spotting
lacing
on
the
glass
floating
particles
are
present
in
the
beer
as
well
smell
is
of
dark
ripe
fruits
vanilla
brown
sugar
caramel
malt
tastes
like
it
smells
with
sweet
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
sweetness
ripe
dark
fruits
like
raisins
or
plums
somewhat
of
a
high
level
of
carbonation
good
drinkability
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
a
very
good
beer
but
im
not
diggin
it
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
the
jolly
friar
on
the
bottle
suggested
that
it
would
make
me
very
happy
and
i
while
i
have
a
smile
on
my
face
im
not
running
off
to
join
robin
hood
and
his
band
of
merry
men
pours
beautifully
and
after
15
minutes
its
still
holding
a
bit
of
head
lacing
is
french
vanilla
white
and
runs
up
the
entire
length
of
the
glass
malty
malty
malty
smelling
and
tasting
creamy
carbonation
is
very
high
which
may
be
putting
me
off
a
bit
its
reminding
me
of
seltzer
water
and
i
never
drink
seltzer
alcohol
taste
is
muted
but
it
does
give
me
a
nice
warm
burn
id
drink
it
again
but
there
are
other
trappists
id
put
way
ahead
of
it
feel
is
medium
smooth
and
easy
like
most
trappists
beers
alcohol
is
not
noted
carb
is
light
not
refreshing
but
satisfying
i
can
drank
a
bunh
more
of
this
why
not
a
deep
oak
brown
brew
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
considerable
head
standing
firm
after
the
pour
sediment
evident
throughout
which
is
typical
of
the
style
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
but
what
is
there
has
a
biscuit
and
caramel
tinge
moderately
full
bodied
flavor
with
caramel
molasses
some
fruits
such
as
apricot
and
pear
very
well
balanced
smooth
through
the
swallow
and
finishing
slightly
dry
no
rough
edges
mouthfeel
is
equal
to
or
slightly
better
than
the
12
but
has
a
letter
less
complex
character
may
vary
based
on
batch
storage
and
age
characteristics
another
great
brew
from
st
bernardus
d
a
great
dubble
to
say
the
least
and
surely
one
of
the
bench
marks
for
the
style
overall
a
wonderful
and
very
drinkable
brew
quite
tasty
very
enjoyable
nice
dubbel
little
bit
too
sugary
seems
like
the
high
sugar
levels
here
almost
stop
the
other
flavours
coming
through
you
could
probably
compare
this
to
cola
if
you
wanted
to
go
to
hell
verdict
prior
8
is
simply
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
yet
it
ticks
all
of
the
boxes
it
confirms
to
style
its
criminally
drinkable
and
its
tasty
as
hell
from
the
first
sip
through
to
the
dregs
really
a
classic
well
made
beer
first
thing
to
strike
you
is
the
creaminess
really
smooth
and
mellow
in
the
mouth
low
carbonation
which
fits
perfectly
dark
fruits
figs
raisins
with
a
pleasant
bready
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
and
cocoa
hint
of
cloves
somehow
both
drinkable
and
sumptuous
drinkability
i
had
this
after
a
chimay
red
tonight
and
this
was
the
hands
down
winner
no
contest
good
dubbel
dont
know
much
about
the
style
so
i
dont
have
much
to
base
it
on
yet
but
i
like
it
overall
basically
to
me
drank
back
to
back
it
tastes
like
a
slightly
stronger
and
more
complex
version
of
the
6
this
has
slightly
better
flavor
profile
but
not
quite
as
drinkable
with
a
more
full
feel
and
higher
abvs
price
4
99
at
whole
foods
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
firm
carbonation
and
a
smooth
coating
feeling
its
almost
chewy
with
a
warm
finish
that
stays
in
your
mouth
for
some
time
after
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
a
solid
average
one
simple
and
well
made
but
not
much
for
big
flavors
and
complexity
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
one
id
come
back
to
i
find
the
6
to
be
much
more
satisfying
d
again
solid
beer
as
its
brothers
solid
dubbel
i
preferred
the
prior
6
more
as
i
thought
it
was
a
touch
dryer
and
even
a
bit
more
complex
still
a
solid
beer
d
less
boozy
than
the
12
means
this
goes
down
extremely
easy
its
not
as
complex
but
still
a
beautiful
example
of
the
dubbel
d
a
very
nice
offering
from
st
bernardus
i
think
i
like
the
pater
6
better
but
this
is
a
great
one
too
quite
full
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
nice
dubbel
more
or
less
hits
the
prototype
of
what
a
dubbel
should
be
in
all
ways
except
maybe
aroma
very
nice
beer
what
could
be
better
besides
a
stiff
scotch
ale
on
a
snowy
evening
than
splitting
a
big
bottle
of
a
good
dubbel
with
ones
spouse
as
comfort
beers
go
the
prior
8
is
among
my
favorites
it
warms
but
does
not
overheat
it
doesnt
overwhelm
with
yeast
and
sugar
it
goes
well
with
anything
including
sushi
and
indian
food
and
its
affordable
a
fine
winter
treat
d
overall
a
tasty
offering
from
st
bernardus
and
worthy
to
any
fan
of
belgians
abv
is
not
overpowering
making
it
pretty
drinkable
a
great
bottle
to
share
with
friends
d
this
would
be
a
near
perfect
dubbel
with
higher
carbonation
and
lacing
yet
another
great
trappist
beer
feels
good
in
the
mouth
easily
drinkable
aroma
nutty
bread
caramel
with
belgian
yeast
maybe
some
raisin
and
vanilla
appearance
red
brown
in
color
hazy
to
clear
tan
head
taste
medium
sweetness
light
bitter
with
raisins
and
figs
but
lightly
palate
med
to
full
bodied
average
carbonation
good
finish
drinkable
beer
but
more
of
a
sipper
d
very
easy
but
rich
d
drinkability
is
moderate
its
a
bit
on
the
higher
side
of
the
scale
for
sweetness
and
alcohol
and
while
the
flavors
are
good
its
a
good
sipper
d
not
bad
this
is
a
classic
belgian
that
shows
exactly
what
a
kicked
up
stronger
alcohol
dubbel
should
taste
like
d
a
fantastic
dubbel
with
everything
in
the
right
place
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
dry
yeasty
earth
to
help
balance
out
the
ripe
and
creamy
fruits
far
superior
to
their
prior
6
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
imo
not
as
good
as
the
pater
6
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
a
good
beer
all
around
without
any
real
faults
to
speak
off
overall
this
is
just
another
wonderful
beer
from
st
bernardus
i
am
sipping
this
on
christmas
night
while
watching
it
snow
with
my
wife
on
the
couch
and
listening
to
christmas
music
making
it
a
near
perfect
moment
a
beer
and
moment
i
will
never
forget
d
a
really
solid
brew
that
i
will
be
buying
again
d
very
smooth
very
drinkable
very
nice
not
really
as
unique
or
as
interesting
as
i
had
expected
surely
not
bad
but
this
should
really
be
firing
on
all
cylinders
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
belgians
over
two
years
ago
prior
8
is
a
mighty
fine
dubbel
very
good
very
delicious
my
only
problem
is
a
cant
stand
cheeries
in
beer
and
as
this
beer
warms
it
comes
out
more
and
more
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
was
actually
the
first
beer
i
had
from
st
bernardus
and
i
have
yet
to
be
let
down
since
this
is
a
great
beer
to
curl
up
with
on
a
cold
winter
night
actually
strike
that
and
curl
up
with
your
significant
or
pet
and
drink
the
beer
beer
bottles
are
lousy
at
cuddling
just
didnt
strike
me
quite
right
i
liked
the
pater
6
and
the
abt
12
better
i
get
more
twang
than
the
sweetness
i
would
prefer
this
is
a
nice
dubbel
ive
certainly
had
better
but
this
ones
pretty
good
all
the
trademark
flavors
are
there
and
it
should
please
fans
of
the
style
recommended
an
amazingly
welcoming
even
delicious
heavenly
brew
straight
from
the
hands
of
that
goddamn
monk
no
wonder
the
prick
is
smiling
d
high
to
say
the
least
very
drinkable
for
8
im
drinking
from
the
11
2oz
bottle
but
i
could
see
myself
purchasing
a
bomber
for
sure
drinkability
a
solid
allround
belgian
brew
though
not
the
best
still
a
beer
i
would
love
to
have
again
and
something
i
would
recommend
drinkabilty
it
has
enough
alcohol
that
you
cant
slam
them
but
its
sweet
and
spicy
very
tasty
and
very
plesurable
to
drink
one
of
the
best
dubbels
out
there
d
very
sweet
in
flavour
melt
in
your
mouth
smooth
alcohol
is
there
but
not
too
intrusive
an
enjoyable
treat
d
very
drinkable
for
an
8
abv
this
is
a
fantastic
dubble
i
love
all
of
the
flavors
that
mingle
so
perfectly
together
and
that
dry
finish
is
fantastic
d
as
with
most
premium
belgian
brew
the
alcohol
is
welldisguised
and
the
flavor
is
amazing
with
a
very
notable
smoothness
definitely
an
impressive
dubbel
that
i
could
never
have
enough
of
5
d
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
but
i
find
the
carbonation
level
at
least
of
this
particular
bottle
interesting
initially
but
tiresome
as
i
work
through
the
bottle
and
therefore
a
bit
detracting
that
said
i
would
gladly
have
another
if
werent
going
to
cost
me
another
7
50
at
that
price
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
did
enjoy
it
but
i
will
venture
on
to
something
else
next
i
do
expect
to
return
to
this
beer
again
at
some
point
just
not
today
d
as
with
all
quality
beers
st
bernardus
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
at
masking
abv
in
none
of
their
beers
ive
tried
can
you
taste
the
alcohol
it
is
slightly
warming
but
no
taste
of
it
whatsoever
a
good
dubbel
most
definitely
a
classic
dubbel
in
that
it
is
less
about
the
sweetness
and
more
about
the
balancing
yeast
fruit
spice
and
alcohol
all
of
which
do
their
personal
best
to
keep
from
becoming
overbearing
monks
they
be
monks
whatever
their
particular
unimportant
denomination
and
they
brew
some
pretty
damned
sorry
pater
good
stuff
as
evidenced
here
live
and
subsequently
learn
pour
yields
foamy
1
finger
tan
head
and
very
very
sticky
lacing
dark
cocacola
coloring
not
quite
black
but
close
smell
is
sticky
sweet
candied
plum
and
burnt
cane
sugar
taste
is
brown
sugar
coated
fig
has
a
touch
of
plum
and
raisin
and
a
taint
of
hoppiness
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
tobacco
carbonation
is
toned
down
as
it
should
be
with
a
beer
like
this
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
bit
hot
on
the
throat
otherwise
a
stellar
belgian
as
a
dubbel
this
is
good
but
i
actually
prefer
the
pater
6
this
is
perhaps
closer
to
a
belgian
strong
dark
alequad
in
the
taste
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
abt
12
this
is
a
nice
dubbel
the
sweetness
could
be
toned
down
alittle
this
is
one
mellow
brew
very
complex
and
one
to
ponder
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
is
just
another
world
class
beer
from
a
world
class
brewery
drinkability
a
little
rich
and
strong
for
a
session
beer
sit
back
and
enjoy
while
it
still
last
very
easy
to
drink
in
spite
of
the
alcohol
very
smooth
drinking
for
8
abv
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
but
that
is
expected
from
this
line
i
could
sip
on
these
for
an
entire
evening
without
a
hint
of
boredom
d
if
i
could
purchase
it
for
less
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
i
think
this
would
do
well
with
cheese
in
particular
the
palate
just
needs
to
be
given
something
other
than
the
high
carbonation
right
now
the
carbonation
is
making
it
difficult
to
detect
even
the
flavors
i
wrote
a
moment
ago
as
my
tongue
is
suffering
d
loving
this
st
bernardus
mixed
4
pack
definitely
calling
it
quits
after
the
6
and
the
8
and
saving
the
tripel
and
12
for
another
night
fantastic
beers
for
a
great
price
plus
an
awesome
chalice
ive
only
had
one
dubbel
previously
chimay
red
and
this
is
impressing
me
more
less
solventlike
alcohol
would
make
this
a
great
beer
and
maybe
more
age
would
solve
that
haha
drinkability
is
great
the
delicious
smell
draws
you
in
and
the
taste
delivers
though
not
as
well
as
it
could
have
the
alcohol
that
shows
up
towards
the
end
doesnt
really
impair
the
drinking
experience
though
sipping
is
recommended
to
fully
enjoy
the
flavor
experience
of
this
quality
belgian
brew
for
a
dollar
more
for
a
750
ill
go
for
the
abt
12
any
day
but
im
not
dissapointed
in
the
9
99
i
spent
on
this
bottle
the
6
and
12
are
better
of
representations
of
their
respective
styles
medium
body
creamy
notable
carbonation
at
first
but
it
soon
calms
down
an
alcoholic
finish
very
drinkable
smooth
not
as
sweet
as
some
two
thumbs
up
hmmmm
expected
a
little
more
from
this
one
pours
a
slightly
murky
mahogony
color
with
a
half
inch
head
that
fades
to
a
few
islands
of
foam
no
much
lacing
at
all
kind
of
bland
aroma
but
there
is
some
spice
dried
fruit
leather
prunes
a
few
things
going
on
in
the
flavor
but
nothing
melds
all
too
well
complex
malt
profile
spicy
fruity
yeast
esters
and
a
combo
of
some
hoppyness
and
hotness
on
the
back
end
not
too
sweat
full
mouthfeel
and
a
little
slick
again
a
little
hot
on
the
backend
i
like
the
beer
not
sure
i
would
seek
it
out
again
real
soon
though
the
body
is
full
rich
and
creamy
i
loved
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
bready
cookie
joined
in
with
the
great
malty
characteristics
that
mimicked
the
nose
a
spicy
alcohol
flavor
appeared
in
the
finish
this
dubbel
delivers
offering
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
coming
back
and
enough
juxtaposition
to
keep
you
guessing
enjoyable
yet
i
managed
to
lose
interest
near
the
end
all
in
all
a
winner
of
a
beer
its
drinkable
smooth
and
is
a
good
beer
for
this
style
just
watch
out
for
the
abv
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
chestnut
coloring
and
a
nice
tan
head
with
some
good
legs
as
it
goes
down
my
tulip
smell
is
dark
fruits
with
a
good
amount
of
caramel
and
some
dark
candied
sugars
taste
is
not
quite
as
refined
with
yeast
character
really
beginning
to
dominate
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
rich
without
too
much
heat
quite
creamy
drinkability
is
quite
good
did
this
as
part
of
the
entire
st
bernardus
lineup
and
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
though
to
be
fair
i
suppose
all
of
them
were
quite
good
all
in
all
this
was
an
ok
brew
kind
of
overrated
imo
good
to
try
if
u
like
belgians
i
have
not
gotten
in
to
them
myself
my
first
st
bernadus
very
good
cannot
wait
for
the
next
one
d
pretty
good
and
easy
drink
this
is
something
you
treat
yourself
to
so
definitely
not
multiple
in
one
night
jd
this
was
unusually
very
easy
to
drink
since
it
was
very
rich
in
flavor
and
had
a
strong
alcohol
presence

opened
this
bottle
to
let
it
warm

breathe
before
pouring
unbeknownst
to
me
it
was
slowly
foaming
out
of
the
bottle
leaving
a
puddle
in
its
wake
luckily
it
didnt
hit

theres
also
a

quality
in
the

but
it
is
difficult
to
nail
down
the
precise
character

follows

pretty
much
the

character
with
the
residual

quality
lingering
between

mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
an
even
and
pleasant
background
carbonation
and
a

feel
a
very
solid
dubbel
with
very
good
complexity
but
not
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
or
with
any
frequency
dvery
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
will
look
for
again
a
true
dubbel
textbook
stuff
here
the
familiar
sights
and
smells
are
all
here
clumpy

with
good
lacing

i
really
like
dubbels
but
this
is
one
i
am
not
real
found
of
prefer
chimay
over
this
and
the
la
trappe
as
well
a
little
too
carbonated
for
me
and
left
me
bloated
lemon
taste
was
a
hindrance
in
this
for
me
i
will
stick
to
their
triple
and
abt
12
drinkability
was
okay
youll
definitely
be
crabwalking
after
three
or
four
of
these
drinkability
this
is
a
rather
heavy
beer
but
one
could
probably
have
three
in
a
night
although
you
would
be
quite
full
as
a
result
as
i
said
before
this
is
my
favorite
dubbel
very
well
balanced
not
overly
malty
or
punishingly
alcoholic
with
out
a
doubt
worth
trying
and
enjoying
beer
has
a
creamy
body
fine
bubbles
round
out
the
sweetness
and
the
minor
ester
character
beer
is
slightly
bready
and
nice
medium
overall
high
drinkability
a
great
obtainable
dubbel
d
super
drinkable
and
deliscious
d
a
really
tasty
and
unique
dubbel
and
a
definite
goto
for
the
style
the
candied
sugar
has
quite
the
presence
in
the
taste
and
really
shows
how
it
can
be
used
in
a
beer
the
strength
is
a
little
more
noticeable
but
it
might
be
that
its
a
fresher
bottle
once
again
the
carbonation
is
quite
assertive
and
cola
like
but
works
for
the
style
aftertaste
is
semisweet
but
not
sticky
or
cloying
cheers
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
a
fine
example
of
dubbel
well
done
st
bernardus
d
for
a
dubbel
the
taste
here
is
slightly
onedimensional
however
still
very
solidly
executed
and
incredibly
drinkable
good
mouthfeel
makes
it
go
down
easy
and
low
ibus
and
big
fruitiness
mean
that
my
palate
is
unlikely
to
be
saturated
by
this
one
widely
available
and
worth
a
shot
this
has
to
be
on
the
short
list
of
style
defining
dubbels
the
word
quintessential
comes
to
mind
further
proof
of
the
brewing
excellence
that
is
st
bernardus
pretty
good
kind
of
a
unique
fruit
sweetness
in
the
taste
ive
had
better
dubbels
though
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
d
another
good
beer
from
st
bernardus
the
alcohol
warmth
does
come
through
a
bit
as
the
beers
warms
up
a
little
bit
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
my
enjoyment
at
all
mouthfeel
is
delicate
and
unique
for
a
dubbel
and
while
the
finish
is
interesting
it
doesnt
convert
into
the
malty
saccharin
finish
characteristic
of
its
type
unique
and
very
good
for
a
single
bottle
still
i
dont
find
it
attractive
enough
to
want
to
down
another
one
in
fact
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
although
im
glad
i
tried
it
on
a
whim
d
not
my
favourite
st
bernardus
mayhap
but
very
good
despite
the
smell
it
didnt
taste
very
alcoholic
nor
did
i
realize
how
quickly
the
beer
was
flowing
from
my
goblet
until
it
was
gone
i
would
have
one
again
but
probably
would
choose
the
abt
12
over
the
prior
8
mouthfeeldrinkability
high
in
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
not
bad
overall
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
d
a
nice
strong
beer
that
doesnt
have
too
much
of
a
kick
very
tasty
an
eminently
drinkable
brew
with
a
nice
malt
richness
and
good
interplay
with
the
alcohol
overall
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
taste
quite
interesting
up
front
flavors
of
cherry
my
favorite
but
thats
soon
overtaken
by
deeper
malts
and
then
hops
the
defining
characteristic
for
me
of
this
beer
is
that
it
has
a
lovely
sweet
taste
the
cherry
but
its
ultimately
a
very
balanced
beer
first
time
ive
tried
this
and
im
in
love
served
from
bottle
into
a
chimay
goblet
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
minimal
offwhite
head
lacing
was
minimal
througout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
and
fruit
notes
the
flavor
was
full
of
fruit
slight
spice
and
minimal
alcohol
it
was
medium
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
that
was
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
was
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
it
is
definite
worth
a
try
for
any
belgian
fan
out
there
who
has
not
tried
it
o
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
belgian
ill
be
purchasing
more
of
this
i
believe
it
tastes
better
than
the
sb
abt
12
this
is
a
definite
recommend
its
not
much
above
average
dubbel
beer
though
im
disappointed
to
say
d
the
fisrt
time
i
darnk
this
beer
i
didnt
rate
it
i
muct
have
had
a
bad
one
becasue
this
is
the
best
dubbel
that
i
have
had
its
richness
and
fuller
body
sets
it
apart
such
a
mistake
in
only
buying
one
not
to
be
missed
d
smooth
and
very
sippable
sweetness
would
keep
me
from
having
a
second
in
the
same
sitting
a
wonderfully
complex
and
tasty
offering
fruity
nose
with
touches
of
malt
quite
complex
the
entrance
is
easy
on
the
palate
but
then
quickly
becomes
exhilarating
a
very
good
body
rich
toasted
malt
and
a
body
far
more
intoxicating
than
other
dubbel
one
senses
in
the
palace
of
keys
and
a
coconut
flavor
to
both
sparkling
and
full
of
flavors
especially
fruit
the
finish
also
has
the
slight
spicy
fruity
good
beer
at
once
heady
fruity
and
spicy
d
it
is
hard
to
shell
out
4
for
a
breweries
middle
beer
when
the
top
shelf
bottle
can
be
had
for
5
despite
this
i
strongly
recommend
that
you
try
this
brew
it
is
among
the
most
well
crafted
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
maybe
just
a
bit
overly
rich
on
the
late
mid
with
a
few
too
many
phenols
to
quaff
otherwise
excellent
throughout
a
rich
enjoyable
winter
ale
drinkability
i
actually
enjoyed
my
wifes
idea
of
an
orange
and
tried
it
as
well
i
couldnt
make
this
a
session
beer
only
because
of
how
special
it
is
this
is
to
be
enjoyed
on
an
occasional
basis
to
celebrate
something
apparently
this
is
what
the
monks
drink
for
dinner
in
watou
lucky
bastards
i
have
to
invest
in
a
cellaring
project
this
would
be
a
prime
candidate
pouring
a
slightly
opaque
rusty
brown
and
giving
birth
to
two
solid
fingers
of
lively
head
could
be
considerably
more
depending
on
your
pour
settling
down
with
light
lacing
featuring
a
thin
lingering
cap
of
tan
foam
throughout
the
full
imbibe
this
beautiful
concoction
throws
off
some
fruity
esters
a
sweet
almost
candylike
malt
aroma
alcohol
present
but
well
controlled
amidst
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
this
one
goes
down
smooth
and
delicious
somewhat
sweet
warm
and
very
easy
to
drink
well
done
bernardus
d
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
dtasty
beer
yes
its
less
complex
and
not
on
the
same
level
as
the
abt
12
but
its
close
carbonation
is
lighter
mouth
feel
is
lighter
but
its
flavor
is
strong
not
a
whole
lot
different
from
the
12
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
this
beer
is
just
as
great
but
dont
expect
a
huge
difference
notes
another
good
offering
from
a
good
brewery
solid
dubbel
that
is
well
spiced
well
balanced
and
complex
flavors
that
interplay
with
each
other
nicely
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
very
tasty
but
the
st
bernardues
tripel
and
abt
12
are
far
more
balanced
and
complex
cheers
this
beer
represents
st
bernardus
very
well
notes
very
good
mouthfeel
due
to
the
expected
high
level
of
carbonation
pours
a
nice
dark
chocolate
with
a
good
frothy
head
begins
with
a
beautiful
clovey
nose
and
a
bit
of
caramelized
banana
bubblegum
brandy
and
rum
flavor
is
more
burnt
banana
with
a
nice
clove
finish
a
thick
feel
with
the
right
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
an
appealing
drink
probably
the
closest
to
westvleteren
as
you
can
get
a
real
delight
drinkability
very
nice
very
much
like
the
pater
6
only
more
nuanced
and
flavorful
at
the
end
of
the
day
im
still
dont
care
for
the
high
carbonation
d
pretty
standard
for
a
dubbel
d
this
is
a
very
dark
yeasty
dubbel
that
borders
on
becoming
a
quadruple
there
is
a
chocolatey
roasted
grain
note
that
weaves
through
the
flavor
and
influences
the
other
flavors
significantly
without
quite
being
strong
enough
to
push
the
beer
out
of
style
it
becomes
most
prevalent
in
the
finish
where
it
combines
with
the
yeast
notes
of
clove
and
allspice
as
well
as
the
caramel
malts
to
produce
a
complex
almost
woody
rum
character
that
lingers
on
the
palate
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
well
worth
seeking
out
good
flavors
and
nice
body
make
this
highly
drinkable
not
to
big
well
balanced
d
a
decent
dubbel
at
best
just
missing
a
littler
personality
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
it
had
kind
of
an
unpleasant
hop
bite
to
it
it
is
quite
refreshing
but
the
alcohol
presence
tells
ou
to
slow
down
d
a
pretty
solid
dubbel
i
thought
it
smelled
a
little
better
than
it
tasted
but
good
and
worth
a
try
none
the
less
not
as
good
as
abt
12
but
something
i
would
try
again
if
you
want
something
that
has
many
levels
of
complexity
this
is
a
must
have
but
i
dont
visit
it
often
given
its
big
brother
is
my
favorite
i
had
the
peche
mortel
earlier
which
is
a
beautiful
beer
but
even
it
doesnt
touch
this
beer
in
complexity
for
this
reason
belgian
quads
are
the
most
interesting
beers
in
the
world
the
abt
12s
little
brother
wont
let
you
down
though
damn
i
knew
this
would
be
good
but
i
didnt
anticipate
just
how
good
a
fridge
staple
for
sure
you
could
do
much
worse
than
stocking
up
on
these
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
medium
brown
with
a
tan
foamy
head
aromas
of
banana
nuts
and
orange
zest
leave
you
wanting
more
the
palate
was
medium
bodied
malty
but
not
over
the
top
with
notes
of
orange
toffee
and
nuts
lead
into
a
malty
sweet
finish
that
really
likes
to
linger
good
beer
i
have
had
some
dubbel
that
were
a
little
bit
to
bitey
this
is
a
nice
even
medium
this
doesnt
have
the
most
robust
flavor
ive
ever
gotten
from
a
dubbel
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
has
a
nice
dark
maltiness
to
it
subtle
notes
of
brown
sugar
light
fruitiness
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
creamy
medium
body
that
is
excellent
with
noticeable
light
fizzy
carbonation
soothing
going
down
smooth
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
all
this
makes
for
a
incredibly
drinkable
dubbel
which
is
maybe
just
a
step
or
so
away
from
perfection
or
at
least
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
cheers
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
brown
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
disappated
to
a
small
little
island
of
foam
smells
of
carmelized
sugar
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
rather
light
and
smooth
the
belgian
yeast
really
brings
the
front
and
back
of
the
palette
together
with
a
sweet
malt
flavor
in
the
middle
the
mouthfeel
is
high
in
carbonation
which
is
really
tricking
my
tounge
into
not
really
knowing
what
the
initial
flavor
is
the
alcohol
isnt
noticable
drinkability
i
cant
believe
its
8abv
this
is
just
an
excellent
beer
very
easy
to
drink
d
overall
a
good
dubble
thats
nice
to
sip
rather
than
gulp
the
alcohol
is
buried
well
making
it
a
silent
killer
definitely
a
good
dubbel
even
a
great
dubbel
its
a
shame
it
smells
so
much
better
than
it
tastes
though
the
nose
does
enhance
the
experience
of
course
overall
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
without
any
real
flaws
i
prefer
a
perhaps
americanized
version
with
more
malt
influence
but
regardless
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
as
good
as
the
abt
12
it
is
so
close
m
t
deceivingly
drinkable
flavors
come
across
as
moderate
abv
will
poke
you
can
be
a
bit
filling
dvery
sweet
and
easy
drinking
a
hint
of
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
but
the
sweet
dark
fruits
and
high
carbonation
hide
it
well
it
had
been
too
long
before
i
tried
prior
8
it
wont
take
this
long
again
tremendous
d
drinks
well
enough
for
a
glass
full
of
sediment
may
have
to
reexamine
this
one
and
try
for
a
better
pourlet
it
sit
for
a
bit
after
grabbing
it
this
guy
pours
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
subjugated
in
the
crowd
the
head
is
bright
and
strong
beneath
which
float
disparate
flakes
of
yeast
or
such
is
my
assumption
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
hints
of
molasses
and
fruits
the
taste
is
rather
sweet
up
front
with
something
akin
to
banana
coming
up
behind
there
are
also
hints
of
a
wheaty
quality
possibly
from
the
yeast
flakes
but
tasty
regardless
the
body
is
medium
at
best
and
sits
nicely
on
the
tongue
with
only
an
iota
of
carbonation
very
nice
and
effective
dubbel
this
brew
poured
to
a
nice
mahogany
color
that
has
ruby
highlights
has
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
has
incredible
retention
and
has
left
a
ton
of
lacing
on
top
of
the
cake
of
bubbles
are
some
brown
specks
could
that
be
yeast
also
suspended
in
the
beer
are
some
floaties
that
i
would
also
imagine
is
yeast
from
the
secondary
fermentation
the
aroma
here
is
of
a
roasted
bready
and
a
biscuit
malt
profile
that
has
a
nice
fruit
scent
candy
caramel
is
there
as
well
the
flavors
of
the
malts
are
nice
my
palette
is
telling
me
the
same
as
my
nose
was
roasted
and
bready
malts
dark
candy
fruit
along
with
a
nice
yeast
presence
has
a
nice
warming
feel
but
in
no
way
has
and
alcohol
flavor
well
hidden
and
as
i
finish
this
really
sneaks
up
on
you
this
brew
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
all
i
can
say
is
i
am
so
happy
i
was
able
to
finally
track
this
down
not
sure
why
i
had
such
a
hard
time
in
this
area
finding
it
now
i
know
that
this
is
a
different
brew
than
the
quad
but
i
do
feel
that
this
brew
is
a
clear
step
down
from
that
one
overall
this
is
ok
not
a
great
dubbel
subpar
st
bernardus
beer
drinkability
this
beer
bears
a
family
resemblance
to
the
6
but
with
a
noticeable
increase
in
richness
and
complexity
of
the
flavors
but
it
retains
some
of
the
light
tart
character
of
the
6
and
is
also
quite
refreshing
to
sip
a
complex
subtle
and
wellbalanced
beer
that
ill
be
happy
to
have
again
drinkability
i
did
not
enjoy
this
as
much
as
the
6
but
liked
the
dark
fruit
that
being
said
i
will
search
for
this
again
and
would
not
pass
it
by
fantastic
dubbel
that
i
will
be
going
back
to
again
like
the
westmalle
double
it
beats
its
big
brother
in
every
way
drinkability
its
a
serious
brew
with
a
decent
abv
and
a
thick
body
it
makes
a
nice
dessert
beer
or
something
with
which
to
end
the
evening
anyone
can
approach
this
dubbel
its
only
mildly
bitter
if
at
all
and
has
plenty
of
familiar
aromas
fd
this
is
a
mouthful
but
savor
it
love
this
beer
and
quickly
becoming
a
huge
fan
of
st
bernardus
this
is
the
closest
think
ive
found
to
what
i
drank
a
lot
of
in
italy
a
couple
years
ago
they
were
big
on
this
style
in
the
pubs
not
perroni
d
an
excellent
dubbel
i
have
found
that
the
dubbel
style
seems
to
be
based
on
the
brewers
interpretation
of
it
there
are
some
that
are
sweet
with
little
malt
such
as
this
one
there
are
some
where
the
malt
dominates
with
little
sweetness
neither
interpretation
is
bad
per
say
its
simply
interesting
that
there
is
such
a
contrast
in
the
same
style
i
dont
think
this
is
noticed
in
styles
such
as
ipas
belgian
witbers
or
hefeweizens
for
example
overall
this
one
is
quite
an
excellent
beer
regardless
of
style
a
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
and
not
simply
quaffed
i
had
this
one
sven
months
later
again
and
now
the
smell
and
taste
of
orange
came
up
a
well
balanced
beer
d
a
good
dubble
thats
nice
all
around
and
nicely
drinkabile
as
a
deep
sipper
the
alcohol
is
buried
well
making
it
a
silent
killer
too
o
good
drinkability
great
beer
st
bernardus
quality
d
a
slow
sipper
here
thats
pretty
enjoyable
ill
probably
get
a
couple
more
of
these
and
check
them
out
in
about
a
year
the
drinkabilty
doesnt
get
much
better
great
flavor
and
well
hidden
abv
plus
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
all
add
up
to
another
winner
from
st
b
taste
the
taste
is
more
pronounce
in
the
malted
sweetness
but
there
is
also
a
slight
bitterness
which
is
more
alcohol
then
anything
good
drinkability
mouthfeel
slightly
thinner
than
expected
high
carbonation
levels
d
this
beer
manages
to
pull
off
the
belgian
candi
characteristics
with
great
balance
it
is
nice
that
there
is
no
stickiness
left
on
the
palate
following
each
swallow
the
abv
is
well
hidden
a
very
nice
belgian
ale
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
a
well
balanced
flavor
none
of
the
spices
or
fruity
notes
are
over
powering
its
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
overall
very
delicious
d
wow
i
will
have
another
i
liked
this
and
should
be
one
that
others
should
seek
out
excellent
and
i
expect
nothing
less
from
st
bernardus
this
a
great
beer
very
complex
but
insanely
drinkable
for
the
style
very
sweet
but
with
the
right
amount
of
toasted
character
and
spices
excellent
d
not
too
high
very
complex
full
bodied
beer
with
a
higher
abv
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
beer
its
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
rivals
its
big
brother
abt
12
overall
an
excellent
beer
it
seems
slightly
better
along
side
some
food
notes
an
outstanding
dubbel
one
of
the
best
i
cant
believe
i
waited
this
long
to
try
it
d
terrific
beer
and
another
stellar
st
b
its
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
no
reason
not
to
drink
this
though
taste
is
nice
and
creamy
malty
and
smooth
an
awesome
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
style
im
really
surprised
by
this
beer
its
really
good
conclusion
good
dubbel
its
not
mindblowing
but
it
is
rocksolid
very
traditional
and
tasty
though
at
1011
bucks
i
think
id
pick
ommegangs
abbey
at
78
over
this
8
times
out
of
10
kelly

it
warms

flavors
of

my
favorite
of
the
line
a
big
beer
complex
and
balanced
best
candidate
for
storing
for
a
few
years
d
quite
drinkable
especially
for
the
style
boozy
and
slightly
sour
the
latter
of
which
is
kind
of
a
shame
and
hurts
drinkability
but
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
youre
meant
to
have
a
bunch
of
and
youre
more
fool
than
me
if
you
try
find
me
a
better
dubbel
and
ill
be
pleasantly
surprised
overall
a
very
good
dubbel
and
one
that
i
would
pick
up
again
overall
i
suspect
it
may
not
of
been
up
to
its
standard
based
off
some
of
the
reports
here
but
i
bought
it
from
what
would
be
classed
the
best
fine
beer
stockists
in
brisbane
so
i
dont
know
id
imagine
this
on
tap
could
be
a
different
drink
altogether
d
although
dubbels
are
not
my
favorite
style
of
belgian
beer
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
will
definitely
drink
again
and
enjoyed
the
experience
d
very
drinkable
especially
for
its
alcohol
content
at
8
but
i
think
in
the
end
i
actually
have
to
give
the
edge
to
the
st
bernardus
6
not
that
i
think
about
it
much
but
brouwerij
st
bernardus
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
breweries
top5
at
least
and
maybe
even
top3
prior
8
is
the
second
best
dubbel
to
have
ever
entered
my
glass
and
is
an
easy
recommendation
to
pretty
much
everyone
this
is
outstanding
ale
from
top
to
bottom
and
from
side
to
side
this
brew
is
good
although
not
really
anything
you
can
session
or
at
least
not
me
it
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
the
alcohol
taste
is
too
apparent
d
excellent
dubbel
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
another
great
beer
by
st
bernardus
mouthfeel
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
notes
this
beer
is
another
solid
brew
from
st
bernardus
d
very
good
like
the
other
bernardus
beers
different
from
the
6
and
8
and
not
just
by
alcohol
percentage
more
lacing
was
laid
down
and
there
was
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
which
also
seemed
a
bit
thicker
all
of
the
flavours
were
amped
up
which
is
a
good
thing
and
joined
by
a
warming
finish
the
body
was
thicker
but
the
carbonation
kept
it
from
being
cloying
even
better
than
the
6
poured
a
medium
brown
with
a
generous
head
that
displayed
good
retention
the
aroma
was
a
musty
smell
to
me
the
taste
was
the
soursweet
of
dark
cherries
the
feed
was
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
ok
no
problems
with
750
ml
bottle
overall
this
is
much
more
than
just
a
lighter
abt
12
amazing
drinkability
is
pretty
high
given
the
dryness
and
wellhidden
alcohol
but
not
tasty
or
satisfying
enough
to
reach
for
another
at
this
price
there
are
many
more
dubbels
i
prefer
at
this
price
nice
malt
backdrop
on
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
well
complex
and
lingering
with
dark
cherry
and
dried
fruit
yet
not
too
much
raisin
perfectly
carbonated
for
the
structure
of
the
beer
giving
the
beer
a
smooth
feel
and
drink
a
masterful
dubbel
that
has
no
obvious
flaws
and
yet
doesnt
try
to
overwhelm
not
as
sugary
rich
as
many
of
the
style
offering
quality
over
quantity
in
that
regard
d
good
i
finished
the
goblet
without
any
problem
drinkability
despite
its
sweetness
and
relatively
high
alcohol
i
could
probably
quaff
this
stuff
all
night
long
medium
bodied
though
it
drinks
like
a
lighterbodied
beer
which
ill
attribute
to
the
carbonation
level
which
also
gives
a
nice
tingle
this
is
a
great
dubbel
3
in
my
st
bernardus
sampler
six
pack
poured
into
my
25cl
chimay
goblet
with
a
redbrown
body
that
is
dim
a
1
finger
head
that
fizzes
out
after
a
few
minutes
the
lacing
is
moderately
low
on
this
one
but
a
nice
coat
is
left
on
top
of
the
beer
smell
is
definitely
that
of
a
solid
belgian
got
the
malts
some
fruit
raisins
and
some
yeast
smell
is
kind
of
subtle
on
this
brew
tastes
of
raisins
a
sort
of
toasty
taste
in
this
one
some
sweets
fruits
apples
again
spices
and
a
decent
alcohol
presence
but
a
tasteful
one
it
is
definately
balanced
by
the
other
tastes
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
the
alcohol
warming
at
the
end
of
the
aftertaste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
might
get
to
me
after
a
while
the
spices
started
to
get
to
me
before
my
glass
was
finished
still
a
good
tasty
and
refreshing
dubbel
d
taste
is
great
and
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
d
extremely
pleasant
beer
but
it
never
quite
takes
off
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
it
has
a
great
array
of
flavors
just
none
of
them
really
wows
d
this
was
a
very
good
example
of
a
dubbel
not
as
awe
inspiring
as
my
favorite
the
abt
12
but
a
wonderful
beer
with
a
great
amount
of
complexity
st
bernardus
prior
8
is
a
dim
cloudy
leathery
brown
ale
with
a
big
fluffy
light
beige
head
that
leaves
tenacious
lacing
it
has
a
grainy
bready
aroma
with
notes
of
raisin
and
prune
it
smells
just
a
touch
sweet
its
medium
maybe
mediumlight
bodied
smooth
and
fluffy
and
quite
bubbly
with
a
clean
finish
there
are
dark
and
dried
fruit
flavors
notes
of
apple
plum
cherry
and
raisin
bread
its
not
very
sweet
almost
savory
with
no
noticeable
bitterness
its
warming
at
the
finish
and
has
a
clean
aftertaste
very
tasty
this
is
not
a
dubbel
to
drink
in
the
summer
more
of
a
fallspring
beer
not
as
easy
to
drink
in
succession
like
the
pater
6
overall
a
very
nice
beer
the
alcohol
starts
to
show
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
so
cant
see
having
too
many
of
these
in
one
night
but
definitely
one
to
have
if
available
poured
from
a
1
pt
9
4
oz
bottle
into
a
st
bernardus
glass
dark
amber
beer
beneath
several
fingers
of
tan
foam
pleasant
fruity
smell
barely
beer
like
tastes
like
a
cross
between
muscadine
wine
and
beer
very
fruity
taste
it
fills
the
mouth
with
a
flavor
that
isnt
exactly
what
i
call
beer
i
can
truthfully
say
that
i
have
never
tasted
anything
like
this
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
this
style
beer
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
the
entire
bottle
carbonation
helps
mix
flavors
doesnt
stand
out
which
is
nice
goes
down
well
but
perhaps
too
quickly
drinkability
a
sipper
but
a
very
enjoyable
one
the
way
the
flavors
blend
together
remind
me
of
christmas
the
gingerbread
and
the
fruits
i
liked
this
a
lot
this
would
be
great
to
enjoy
by
a
fire
on
a
cold
winter
day
too
bad
im
drinking
it
in
july
the
last
two
st
bernardus
beer
ive
had
have
been
over
carbonated
and
gassy
so
i
think
that
the
prior
8
may
actually
have
been
improved
by
gushing
much
better
than
the
pater
6
almost
as
good
as
the
12
in
my
opinion
a
great
beer
so
far
i
would
say
that
i
am
pretty
impressed
with
the
st
bernardus
beers
i
still
need
to
try
their
tripel
and
quad
but
this
one
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
ones
i
have
had
pretty
enjoyable
brew
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
belgian
ales
all
that
much
recommended
worth
seeking
out
but
not
the
best
ive
had
from
st
bernardus
go
big
and
get
the
12
slick
mouthfeel
good
high
carbonation
but
it
does
feel
slightly
watery
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
the
lovely
malt
character
may
not
be
for
some
that
prefer
a
little
more
hop
character
but
for
me
it
was
great
wish
i
had
grabbed
a
few
more
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
dubbel
it
has
a
nice
appearance
and
smell
but
a
little
dryer
bitter
than
i
like
d
8
abv
is
fairly
prominent
in
the
aroma
the
taste
and
the
warming
sensation
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
one
more
11
2oz
bottle
and
i
would
be
good
to
go
a
very
pleasant
belgian
dubbel
hard
to
say
which
i
prefer
the
prior
8
or
the
pater
6
its
a
tough
call
and
my
ratings
go
to
show
just
how
close
these
two
beers
are
what
i
can
tell
you
for
sure
is
that
both
are
fantastic
dubbels
in
their
own
respects
and
both
showcase
the
quality
beers
brewed
by
the
monks
at
st
bernardus
d
i
must
have
been
in
a
really
good
mood
last
night
to
me
this
beer
was
simply
amazing
rich
and
complex
i
found
myself
thoroughly
enjoying
every
sip
abt
12
is
up
next
as
the
last
stop
on
my
st
bernardus
beer
tour
prior
8
has
set
the
bar
pretty
high
heres
hoping
12
can
match
it
tm
lots
of
malts
and
fruity
goodness
raisin
and
plum
with
a
heavy
dose
of
carbonation
a
mild
medicinal
taste
in
the
back
from
the
alcohol
served
in
my
uprising
chalice
appears
very
dark
with
a
head
full
of
tiny
bubbles
the
bubbles
leave
a
fine
lace
all
around
the
glass
while
im
drinking
the
taste
is
malty
at
first
with
hints
toffee
at
the
end
there
is
a
hint
of
alcohol
to
the
flavor
but
not
nearly
as
strong
as
you
would
think
an
8
abv
beer
would
taste
there
is
a
bit
of
noticeable
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
but
it
isnt
distracting
in
the
least
overall
a
very
fine
beer
i
enjoy
a
darker
belgian
style
to
a
lighter
so
i
think
i
actually
prefer
thins
to
the
st
bernie
12
as
long
as
im
not
driving
i
could
have
a
number
of
these
wow
poured
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
a
huge
tannish
head
plenty
of
carbonation
on
this
brew
nose
is
sugar
candied
fruits
caramel
dried
dark
fruits
roastiness
and
all
of
this
is
in
the
taste
too
this
was
an
exceptional
dubbel
very
smooth
and
rich
easy
drinking
and
probably
one
of
the
best
dubbels
i
have
had
ever
4
0
d
pretty
good
not
spectacular
d
its
a
sipper
on
tap
at
oakmont
pub
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
millimeter
or
so
of
head
black
but
purpleish
color
bar
was
dark
smell
is
of
wine
and
raisins
the
taste
is
of
raisin
as
spices
as
well
as
alcohol
very
thick
beer
definitely
a
sipper
not
what
i
would
have
thought
as
a
dubbel
drinkability
not
great
but
worth
a
whirl
m
d
coats
the
mouth
with
its
full
goodness
but
clears
out
well
and
leaves
the
palate
with
a
brightness
that
invites
the
next
sip
d
very
drinkable
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
will
definately
enjoy
again
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
best
served
at
cellar
temp
and
take
your
time
and
allow
it
to
open
up
and
let
all
sorts
of
new
flavors
come
out
dexcept
for
the
carbonation
sting
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
will
definitely
go
back
to
this
one
in
the
future
with
a
more
thorough
review
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
body
w
twofinger
head
a
husky
thick
bitter
malt
smell
with
a
mix
of
grainy
roastedtoasted
malts
with
coffee
and
some
sweet
malts
like
caramel
a
sweet
creamy
sugary
malt
taste
as
i
pick
up
caramel
nuts
oat
as
well
as
some
chocolate
there
are
some
dark
fruitfig
tastes
for
balance
and
it
finishes
slightly
dry
thanks
to
some
roasted
malts
but
overall
this
a
medium
to
heavy
bodied
beer
that
is
sweet
i
must
add
that
i
noticed
some
fruit
notes
on
the
backend
with
the
dry
malt
feeling
could
be
some
hop
bitterness
although
it
had
a
slight
grape
tinge
this
is
a
great
dubbel
from
st
bernardus
drinkability
was
superb
at
no
point
did
i
not
find
myself
not
enjoying
this
beer
it
was
really
hard
to
put
my
glass
down
between
the
tasting
and
smelling
brilliant
drinkability
a
little
different
from
the
norms
of
the
style
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
strong
dark
flavor
and
high
alcohol
content
make
it
a
nice
sipper
i
found
a
preference
to
this
over
the
triple
and
would
drink
this
one
again
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
super
drinkable
brew
the
beer
fled
my
glass
quicker
than
id
expected
from
an
8
beer
doesnt
quite
fit
the
dubbel
style
very
nicely
what
with
the
roasted
and
smoky
qualities
but
nevertheless
this
is
one
excellent
brew
i
will
be
grabbing
again
the
near
future
id
say
this
is
my
favorite
in
the
st
bernardus
line
even
out
does
the
abt
12
for
me
recommended
for
sure
i
factored
the
drinkability
so
low
just
because
this
beer
is
to
be
sipped
the
flavors
need
be
appreciated
prior
8
is
a
very
nice
dubbel
its
every
bit
as
good
as
pater
6
though
neither
materially
distinguishes
itself
from
the
other
yes
this
one
is
a
little
stronger
and
has
a
more
substantial
yeasty
flavor
but
i
like
them
equally
they
also
suffer
from
the
same
fault
they
dont
have
that
special
something
that
drives
them
to
the
next
level
i
honestly
believe
its
a
stronger
spicy
flavor
thats
just
my
take
nonetheless
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
thats
easily
recommended
poured
from
a
bottle
in
to
my
st
bernardus
goblet
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
lively
huge
head
in
fact
upon
opening
the
bottle
foam
began
to
seep
over
the
top
smell
was
of
caramel
and
toffee
along
with
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
taste
was
amazing
subtle
fruits
along
with
toffee
and
caramel
similar
but
even
better
than
the
smell
this
is
very
delicious
and
makes
me
want
to
come
back
for
another
sip
soon
mouthfeel
was
good
nice
and
foamy
drinkability
was
high
due
to
the
incredible
taste
and
smell
a
true
gem
d
great
beer
only
issue
is
the
flavors
get
a
little
cloying
by
the
end
of
the
glass
md
rather
refreshing
with
a
decent
moderate
body
and
light
fizziness
this
big
brother
of
pater
6
shows
a
deeper
profile
of
dark
malts
yet
overall
lacks
a
level
of
complexity
that
is
supposed
to
be
built
upon
the
junior
ones
virtuosity
that
said
i
find
this
an
utterly
drinkable
sample
of
dubbel
for
its
elegant
integrity
on
the
flavour
and
a
total
absence
of
alc
feel
good
beer
had
it
as
a
sampler
from
st
bernardus
got
a
cool
glass
to
drink
it
out
of
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
seems
to
portray
the
dubbel
style
nicely
very
enjoyable
dark

another
great
one

another

pours
deep

in
color
with
some
sediment
big
creamy
head
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
dark
fruit
pear
and
white
grape
overall
very
sweet
taste
is
very
similar
some
sweet
bicuit
malt
with
apple
pear
and
other
sweet
fruit
some
earthiness
and
grass
mouthfeel
is
very
light
almost
champagne
like
on
the
first
sip
due
to
the
higher
carbonation
dry
sweet
aftertaste
overall
a
great
beer
and
easy
drinker
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
this
is
a
great
slow
sipper
at
warmer
temps
creamy
one
finger
head
on
the
pour
that
left
heavy
lace
upon
swirling
the
beer
appeared
a
dark
redamber
when
held
to
light
and
was
a
bit
clouded
due
to
the
yeast
sediment
remaining
from
the
bottle
conditioning
process
the
aroma
was
lightly
fruity
and
sweet
the
distinct
tart
odor
of
the
belgian
yeast
came
through
and
offered
a
complex
and
appealing
twist
to
the
blend
of
scents
present
the
carbonation
is
high
but
feels
good
to
the
inside
of
the
mouth
tingling
all
over
and
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
substantial
but
not
so
thick
as
to
linger
long
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
the
flavor
is
nice
true
to
the
name
of
a
dubbel
very
good
and
well
balanced
the
finish
is
there
but
dissipates
quickly
although
the
remaining
flavors
of
clove
and
malt
are
very
pleasant
while
they
last
would
definitely
drink
again
but
not
every
day
very
good
ale
this
is
yet
another
excellent
ale
from
st
bernardus
a
real
treat
when
and
if
you
can
find
one
apparently
st
bernardus
8
doesnt
crack
the
list
of
my
favourite
dubbels
nevertheless
its
a
beer
i
greatly
enjoy
in
an
ideal
world
this
would
be
present
at
more
dinner
tables
and
in
more
cold
cellars
than
is
currently
the
case
this
abbey
may
not
have
the
legal
rights
to
bear
the
trappist
logo
but
their
beers
have
every
bit
the
same
quality
and
historical
significance
there
was
a
big
fig
aroma
unmistakeable
with
air
an
aroma
of
walnuts
but
more
than
that
pumpernickel
loaf
taste
is
figs
dates
sweet
dried
prune
the
mouthfeel
struck
me
as
superb
nicely
balanced
bitterness
is
muted
but
in
the
mix
with
the
malt
and
yeast
slight
hints
of
dark
fruit
start
to
emanate
with
more
tilting
of
the
glass
green
or
dark
cherry
from
a
brandy
fruit
cake
but
with
sugars
well
in
the
background
so
the
sweetness
never
takes
on
a
life
of
its
own
or
becomes
cloying
overall
a
real
treat
for
north
american
tastebuds
beers
like
this
distinguish
the
true
beer
lovers
from
the
party
animals
and
the
uninitiated
i
could
use
a
few
more
of
these
to
remind
me
every
so
often
of
just
how
rich
the
beer
experience
can
be
d
very
drinkable
light
and
creamy
with
a
malty
backbonestrong
carmell
with
a
good
sharp
metallic
edge
dark
fruitiness
lightly
blended
through
the
mix
with
a
earthy
feel
well
balanced
with
a
nice
tart
woody
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
kicking
the
drinkabilty
up
a
notch
a
very
nice
belgianone
that
worths
keeping
on

along
with

and
fig
throwing
down
and
a
slight
hit
of
flavor
from
the
alcohol
very
fine
carbonation
but
creamy
as
well
this
is
just
delicious
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
beer
by
st
bernardus
it
is
super
complex
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
great
d
very
tasty
beer
i
prefer
this
one
to
the
pater
6
because
its
finish
isnt
quite
as
dry
d
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
1
or
2
due
to
the
carbonation
but
definitely
not
a
boring

perfectly

d
at

percent
and
being
this

not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
two
of
these
i
had
the
6
prior
to
this
which
i
thought
was
more
drinkable
but
the
8
is
much
more
complex
not
as
drinkable
or
candysweet
as
the
westy
8
but
still
a
very
good
beer
in
its
own
right
d
an
exceptional
dubbel
with
classic
earthiness
and
a
perfect
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
hard
to
beat
a
sweet
beer
overall
with
a
decent
abv
easy
to
savor
and
enjoy

with
a
small

me

d
not
my
favorite
of
the
st
bs
beers
so
far
pater
6
and
abt

come
with
much
higher
recommendations
amazing
beer
one
of
the
best
bottle
caramel
pour
with
slightly
red
tinge
and
a
bit
cloudy
nice
lacing
and
a
medium
tan
head
that
tasted
almost
as
good
as
the
beer
itself
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
taste
of
caramel
yeast
and
faint
orange
and
nectarine
with
sugar
and
spice
very
complex
smooth
yet
full
finish
d
an
incredibly
sweet
and
smooth
beer
per
style
full
of
rich
caramel
bread
ripe
fruit
that
was
superbly
brewed
to
produce
a
great
drinking

great
characterful
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
frothy
beige
head
aroma
of
dark
fruit
alcohol
and
chocolate
very
tasty
beer
with
lots
of
malty
chocolate
raisin
prune
plum
spice
and
alcohol
nice
soft
carbonation
up
front
with
a
sweet
malty
center
and
nice
dry
spicy
finish
this
is
a
musttry
if
you
like
sweet
dark
belgianstyle
ales
would
be
a
great
accompaniment
to
jerk
chicken
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
slightly
watery
not
a
stunning
dubbel
but
a
solid
representative
a
good
starter
for
those
not
familiar
with
the
style
not
a
bad
dubbel
but
i
have
had
much
better
not
very
complex
though
a
pleasant
enough
example
of
the
style
i
always
like
to
support
abbey
and
trappist
ales
as
well
drinkability
the
dark
fruits
arent
as
complex
as
with
other
dubbels
still
a
quality
brew
d
this
is
a
good
abbey
beer
its
not
the
most
striking
dubbel
in
flavour
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
distinctly
belgian
and
it
would
make
a
great
starting
point
for
those
just
beginning
to
get
into
belgiums
wonderful
and
diverse
brews
its
got
something
in
there
for
everyone
i
think
one
of
the
most
drinkable
high
gravity
brews
ive
ever
had
recommended
excellent
beer
overall
a
great
dubbel
finishing
slightly
sweeter
than
others
adds
to
its
drinkability
as
with
a
fair
amount
of
dubbel
offerings
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
this
ones
parts
quite
drinkable
with
wellhidden
alchohol
part
of
one
of
the
better
gift
sets
ive
seen
in
a
while
i
have
had
this
beer
before
and
i
dont
remember
it
tasting
like
this
this
is
not
to
say
i
am
disappointed
just
i
remember
this
beer
differently
i
wonder
what
aging
would
do
to
this
one
good
beer
just
not
what
i
remembered
this
poured
an
opaque
brown
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
creamy
sweet
yeast
and
caramel
malt
and
grassy
hops
it
tasted
like
rich
malty
caramel
and
creamy
yeast
with
orange
and
lime
hops
the
yeast
became
more
pronounced
as
it
warmed
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
very
nice
flavor
that
was
fairly
simple
but
very
clean
and
enjoyable
texture
was
good
too
and
alcohol
was
well
hidden
making
this
easy
to
rink
very
nice
dubbel
drinkability
is
good
but
its
special
enough
to
just
savor
the
one
small
serving
for
an
entire
evening
drinkability
is
relatively
high
its
a
nice
tasting
beer
and
a
nice
experience
i
prefer
the
12
and
tripel
but
would
certainly
buy
this
one
again
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
spicy
crystal
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
an
almost
peppery
set
of
spices
and
a
wonderful
alcohol
burn
the
feel
is
heavy
and
wet
i
liked
this
one
just
a
nice
smooth
spicy
beer
with
a
good
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
beer
and
apparent
in
the
taste
definately
one
ill
need
to
sample
again
in
the
future
nice
full
feel
and
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
sends
some
warmth
to
the
head
after
a
few
sips
not
my
favorite
dubbel
this
is
a
winner
for
me
very
tasty
satisfying
recommended
belgian
dubbel
d
good
beer
but
for
the
price
there
are
a
lot
of
better
beers
the
taste
was
not
overly
complex
but
a
nice
balanced
combination
of
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
super
smooth
giving
the
beer
a
great
finish
overall
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
but
i
prefer
some
others
i
have
tried
the
flavors
are
too
mild
and
powdery
compared
to
other
belgian
dubbels
in
the
land
worth
a
taste
d
i
dont
find
this
the
most
drinkable
dubbel
in
the
world
that
i
found
it
somewhat
buttery
like
an
english
brown
didnt
help
i
find
chimay
red
a
much
drier
more
elegant
example
pours
up
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
maroon
edges
when
held
to
the
light
fantastic
frothy
offwhite
head
with
great
retentive
lacing
the
nose
has
wonderful
spices
candy
sugar
my
girl
suggests
candy
red
apple
slight
alcohol
scent
subtle
caramel
dark
fruits
for
sure
strawberries
slight
dry
vanilla
as
it
warms
up
smells
like
a
very
festive
beer
the
taste
is
subtle
cocoa
darker
malts
subtle
sweet
malts
darker
fruits
plums
very
carbonated
dry
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
syrupy
taste
left
behind
in
my
mouth
nice
complex
brew
thats
why
i
love
st
bernardus
i
wonder
if
its
the
same
beer
as
st
sixtus
drinkability
whats
the
abv
on
this
puppy
eight
percent
flavor
is
pretty
strong
and
body
is
heavy
lump
that
together
with
a
fairly
big
abv
and
what
do
you
get
lower
drinkability
good
beer
but
im
fine
with
just
one
another
selection
from
a
st
bernardus
mixed
6
pack
i
recently
purchased
this
one
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
similar
to
the
last
one
the
pater
6
nice
foamy
head
that
does
taper
off
a
bit
aroma
is
slightly
malty
and
grainy
but
its
faint
theres
just
not
much
there
there
is
however
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
it
seems
relatively
fullbodied
too
the
taste
is
malty
quite
sweet
brown
sugar
with
some
fruit
and
caramel
it
all
blends
in
nicely
but
its
not
the
type
of
beer
i
would
drink
several
of
at
one
seating
good
thing
too
as
its
not
cheap
drinkability
paired
very
well
with
some
pinback
mp3s
a
delightful
dubbel
to
be
sure
ill
see
how
it
compares
to
the
abt
12
which
is
up
next
once
again
an
excellent
brew
from
st
bernardus
would
serve
this
up
any
day
of
the
week
but
be
careful
cause
the
moderate
abv
can
jump
up
and
grab
ya
this
beer
was
simply
amazing
i
had
high
expectations
for
it
and
it
surpassed
them
pours
a
deep
acorn
colour
with
a
nice
slightly
brown
head
that
reminded
me
of
cinnamon
baked
goods
plenty
of
chunky
yeasts
i
did
not
decant
i
like
the
yeast
the
scent
was
beautiful
plenty
of
baked
bread
yeast
malts
vanilla
grapes
apples
pears
it
was
like
a
nice
farmers
market
on
a
sunday
oh
god
the
taste
exquisite
not
overly
complex
but
a
blend
of
different
flavours
all
getting
an
equal
share
plenty
of
fruits
caramel
bit
of
honey
breads
even
a
bit
of
a
flavour
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
a
woody
flavour
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
a
bit
carbonated
drinkable
yes
i
could
sip
a
glass
all
day
and
not
tire
of
it
prior
8
is
supersmooth
and
fullish
in
body
with
vivid
carbonation
that
aids
this
drink
into
unmitigated
quaffability
d
very
drinkable
for
a
doppel
great
taste
really
enjoyable
gonnan
try
the
pater
and
abbot
for
sure
its
a
quality
beer
perhaps
a
little
overhyped
definitely
worth
a
try
maybe
two
or
three
nicely
put
together
i
really
like
dubbels
in
the
winter
for
they
seem
to
warm
me
up
as
this
one
did
could
not
resist
trying
it
on
tap
though
fairly
drinkable
but
one
is
enough
very
nice
beer
i
am
really
high
on
the
belgian
styles
overall
this
is
a
great
dubbel
and
deserves
the
praise
d
this
is
a
great
beer
but
you
probably
dont
want
to
hit
too
many
one
a
night
is
more
than
enough
this
beer
has
amazing
balance
and
feel
cant
wait
to
experience
the
other
brews
this
brewery
has
to
offer
i
picked
this
up
after
trying
other
belgium
styles
and
have
not
been
impressed
to
me
this
really
tastes
like
a
grape
soda
that
has
been
infused
with
alcohol
it
was
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
can
see
this
beer
appealing
to
those
who
dont
have
alot
of
experience
with
many
belgium
styles
drinkability
very
high
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
with
some
little
speckles
in
it
smells
of
dried
fruit
and
malt
and
tastes
very
mildly
of
figs
blackberries
and
some
other
assorted
spices
lots
of
little
hints
of
flavors
but
jsut
not
much
overall
quantity
of
flavor
i
got
bored
before
finishing
the
glass
just
not
that
interesting
overall
d
not
as
flavorful
and
complex
as
i
expected
but
a
very
enjoyable
dubbel
d
a
nice
dubbel
i
really
enjoyed
the
immense
pepper
d
low
but
only
because
this
is
so
amazing
i
want
to
savor
one
of
these
over
a
long
period
and
i
will
only
drink
this
on
occasion
highly
quaffable
beer
highly
recommended
top
notch
brew
highly
recommended
notes
decent
dubbel
ah
the
ocho
a
very
fine
dubbel
d
good
drinkability
and
better
than
the
6
but
still
not
a
great
dubbel
a
very
good
tasting
ale
this
one
can
creep
up
on
ya
glad
i
bought
a
4
pack
ill
have
more
tonight
but
keep
the
other
2
for
later
d
this
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
good
taste
id
get
this
for
someone
new
to
belgians
worth
a
try
poured
this
11
2oz
bad
boy
into
my
valdieu
goblet
pours
a
cherry
brown
with
mahogany
tones
when
held
up
to
the
light
poured
a
huge
creamytan
head
that
stuck
around
the
entire
length
of
the
beer
and
left
really
sticky
lacing
down
the
length
of
the
glass
this
is
a
really
pretty
beer
smell
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
there
are
definite
notes
of
figs
and
raisins
and
just
a
hit
of
cinnamon
not
much
else
this
has
a
very
straightforward
aroma
taste
is
interesting
there
are
the
definite
notes
of
a
normal
dubbel
but
there
is
an
after
taste
that
i
cant
quite
place
my
tongue
on
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
it
tastes
like
the
flavors
i
sometimes
see
in
my
homebrews
not
a
bad
taste
not
even
necessarily
off
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
that
finishes
dry
nothing
would
prevent
me
from
buying
this
beer
again
a
full
flavored
balanced
dubbel
probably
the
most
flavorful
authentic
version
of
the
style
ive
had
to
date
tough
to
find
flaws
overall
those
monks
at
st
b
sure
know
what
they
are
doing
love
their
quad
and
triple
and
the
dubbel
does
not
disappoint
either
there
is
a
reason
they
have
been
brewing
beer
for
as
long
as
they
have
and
this
is
one
of
them
an
easy
belgian
to
drink
d
smooth
with
a
lingering
of
alcohol
this
has
a
nice
dark
fruit
and
slightly
sweet
flavor
finishes
clean
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
sweetness
doesnt
hang
around
at
all
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
abv
is
not
detectable
a
very
nice
dubbel
and
a
benchmark
for
the
style
cost
high
abv
and
availability
hurts
drinkability
as
i
stated
earlier
i
like
a
beer
whos
head
stays
throughout
the
drink
this
beer
has
that
trait
it
is
also
a
dam
good
tasting
beer
overally
a
very
nice
beer
as
was
expected
from
st
b
pretty
easy
to
drink
fairly
complex
everything
a
belgian
should
be
really
drinkability
is
superb
but
i
need
to
watch
myself
it
goes
down
like
a
session
beer
but
beware
prosit
mk
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
mud
puddle
brown
color
with
a
nice
khaki
colored
head
that
left
some
spotty
lacing
all
over
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
brown
sugar
fig
and
raisins
sweet
and
a
tad
funky
the
taste
is
of
raisinsprunes
candi
sugar
sweetness
and
a
light
bready
malt
the
feel
is
moderate
with
prickly
carbonation
and
finishes
sweet
but
not
slick
a
very
nice
sweet
dubbel
which
is
very
drinkable
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
of
a
malty
presence
in
my
dubbel
to
distinguish
it
from
a
bsda
and
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
pours
a
rich
brown
color
with
a
nice
white
thick
fluffy
head
the
head
resides
after
sometime
and
leaves
a
thick
lace
film
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
smells
of
caramel
and
bread
with
a
bit
earthiness
to
it
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
fruits
biscuits
yeast
and
a
dash
of
hoppiness
towards
the
end
it
has
a
medium
body
and
finishes
incredibly
overall
extremly
well
executed
beer
very
well
done
drinks
too
easy
id
guess
this
at
a
bout
6
5
abv
if
i
didnt
know
easily
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
now
that
ive
tasted
it
nice
but
nothing
special
when
placed
next
to
other
st
bernardus
selections
nice
aroma
with
pine
caramel
malts
and
apples
appearence
is
a
muddy
brown
with
smallish
offwhite
head
lacing
as
always
excellent
from
st
bernardus
flavor
is
sweet
throughout
with
a
nutty
yeasty
finish
this
is
a
must
try
gotta
love
the
dubbels
st
bernardus
prior
8
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
short
cream
colored
head
it
gives
off
a
mild
smell
that
is
a
bit
yeasty
the
taste
is
mellow
with
hints
of
fruit
and
a
slight
yeast
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
also
highly
carbonated
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
to
drink
but
the
high
carbonation
and
yeasty
aftertaste
hinders
this
brews
drinkability
a
bit
for
me
drinkability
delicious
dubbel
easy
drinking
not
too
alcoholic
or
overwhelming
good
winter
warmer
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
about
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
exhibited
decent
retention
aroma
is
quite
good
malts
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
good
as
well
sweet
caramel
malts
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
huge
fruity
esters
some
fig
and
dark
cherries
with
tons
of
raisins
interplay
quite
nicely
with
just
a
touch
of
spiceyness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
overall
very
complex
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
good
mediumfull
body
with
medium
carbonation
quite
smooth
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
a
complex
and
interesting
brew
that
is
a
pleasure
to
sip
and
enjoy
a
good
beer
to
try
at
least
once
but
not
one
ill
seek
out
again
nothing
really
special
for
a
beer
of
its
type
bot
not
bad
either
i
could
drink
these
all
night
the
more
belgian
beer
i
sample
the
more
i
fall
in
love
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
i
like
the
12
a
bit
better
but
this
is
certainly
recommended
m
d
a
similar
lively
carbonation
that
comes
across
as
a
just
a
touch
harsh
on
the
tongue
as
with
the
pater
this
seems
perhaps
a
little
wetter
and
so
it
is
a
offers
some
rather
nice
gulps
from
the
goblet
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
would
lean
towards
the
lighter
6
simply
to
avoid
being
overwhelmed
with
another
poured
in
to
a
small
mug
because
the
bar
had
no
proper
belgian
glasses
oh
well
foamy
head
pretty
good
retention
lots
of
yeasty
hayfloral
sweet
candy
smells
coming
through
taste
is
very
sweet
bready
feel
a
little
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
very
sticky
mouthfeel
this
one
is
a
sipper
almost
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
i
could
definatley
enjoy
this
very
much
as
dessert
d
each
sip
begs
for
another
nice
red
slightly
cloudy
body
with
thick
head
and
sparse
lace
warm
leather
slightly
sour
smell
with
a
little
alcohol
and
spice
malty
if
with
sweet
alcoholic
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
active
carbonation
and
alcoholic
finish
good
overall
but
i
felt
that
the
alcohol
came
through
a
little
strong
very
nice
though
ill
admit
up
front
that
st
bernardus
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
prior
8
is
no
exception
though
i
admit
i
like
abt
12
a
little
more
it
has
a
somewhat
darker
appearance
common
to
dubbels
it
has
a
fruity
subtle
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
excellent
though
the
alcohol
does
creep
through
a
little
in
its
taste
like
other
st
bernardus
brews
it
has
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
lively
and
highly
carbonated
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
one
with
more
personality
than
most
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
good
dubbel
recommended
drinkability
had
no
problem
going
back
to
this
brew
great
beer
to
sip
on
and
really
appreciate
the
complex
flavors
the
flavor
was
strong
on
the
malt
with
a
bread
taste
in
the
front
it
was
sweet
all
through
out
the
mouthfeel
gives
you
a
well
rounded
carbonation
with
a
real
bready
taste
left
all
over
the
mouth
overall
one
of
the
better
dubbels
i
have
tried
from
an
11
2
oz
bottle
copped
singly
from
total
wine
and
more
in
union
this
belgian
staple
pours
a
gorgeous
rubyred
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
that
displays
good
staying
power
smell
is
very
malty
and
sweet
strong
aroma
with
a
rich
thick
and
full
flavor
to
match
taste
is
extremely
malty
with
a
distinct
sweetness
pulling
through
present
with
a
fig
and
prune
taste
filled
with
caramel
and
dark
notes
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
awesome
brew
slight
alcohol
presence
but
hard
to
detect
behind
a
great
conglomeration
of
flavors
topnotch
sample
that
was
worth
the
price
first
brew
from
st
bernardus
and
am
eager
to
experience
their
other
wellknown
styles
recommended
drinkability
dummy
me
i
opened
it
after
it
said
it
can
be
stored
for
10
years
i
saw
a
lot
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
and
i
have
a
record
of
keeping
beers
around
too
long
in
the
cellar
why
didnt
i
buy
this
before
d
i
am
not
a
particular
fan
of
dubbels
but
this
one
is
very
good
drinkable
and
complex
not
overly
sweet
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
in
new
mexico
if
i
could
it¬íd
probably
be
a
regular
taste
luscious
and
complex
taste
that
just
spreads
across
the
tongue
this
is
the
kind
of
taste
i
have
come
to
expect
from
st
bernardus
starts
with
a
nice
malty
character
toasted
as
well
as
caramel
then
comes
a
spiced
fruity
note
that
i
likened
to
cinnamon
and
plum
finishes
smooth
with
a
light
sweetness
exceptional
taste
for
a
dubbel
and
a
new
favorite
of
the
style
drinkability
very
drinkable
masks
its
alcohol
superbly
this
is
a
decent
brew
very
drinkable
high
abv
is
almost
unnoticeable
flavor
is
balanced
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
good
will
be
drinking
this
again
d
i
feel
like
the
prior
8
is
all
nose
little
bite
besides
carbonic
a
delicious
dubbel
but
with
such
rich
aromatics
the
flavor
in
the
mouth
leaves
more
to
be
desired
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
it
pops
open
just
like
a
belgian
should
no
weak
ass
apologetic
pop
like
some
pours
dark
brown
and
at
first
reminds
me
of
chimay
red
however
it
is
a
little
nuttier
and
not
as
plain
bread
and
spice
on
the
nose
good
dark
fruit
raisin
or
fig
on
the
initial
taste
and
lighter
fruits
on
the
finish
abv
is
well
hidden
smooth
and
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
or
very
dark
red
with
a
big
thick
head
and
it
has
a
big
malty
aroma
with
some
chocolate
and
faint
fruit
taste
is
a
tad
thin
some
dark
fruits
black
cherries
prunes
and
clove
fairly
sweet
with
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
a
good
beer
that
i
would
never
run
down
but
the
other
choices
from
st
bernardus
stand
out
a
bit
better
for
me
d
another
stellar
offering
from
bernardus
is
not
surprising
wellbalanced
and
complex
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
profile
flavors
open
upon
warming
and
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
this
one
is
not
as
good
to
me
as
the
abt
12
but
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
when
i
opened
the
bottle
and
i
am
very
pleased
just
another
a
from
these
guys
this
caps
off
a
memorable
evening
of
beerdrinking
starting
with
the
st
b
abt
12
then
the
tripel
and
now
the
prior
8
i
expected
the
first
to
be
best
and
then
down
in
scale
for
the
others
but
its
almost
the
reverse
these
st
bernardus
brews
are
incredible
all
of
them
d
to
be
fair
this
is
only
the
second
dubbel
ive
tried
and
it
puts
the
alagash
to
shame
that
is
for
sure
so
quite
a
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
aroma
is
strongly
malty
and
yeasty
with
hints
of
banana
and
fruity
sweetness
color
is
dark
brown
rather
chocolaty
with
a
fairly
persistent
head
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweet
and
some
fruity
and
smoky
undertones
finish
is
smooth
and
lively
and
has
a
ribbon
of
hop
bitterness
overall
a
very
satisfying
ale
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
slightly
doughy
very
enjoyable
milk
chocolate
brown
liquid
with
an
egg
white
head
that
doesnt
go
away
until
youre
done
drinking
hazy
sediment
appearance
malty
grain
smell
tastes
of
yeast
alcohol
bread
and
fruity
undertones
this
beer
has
ample
carbonation
in
the
feel
and
leaves
a
pleasant
bready
malt
taste
on
the
palate
it
warms
the
whole
way
down
a
wonderful
sipping
beer
to
have
with
a
few
friends
this
is
a
great
dubbel
but
i
actually
prefer
from
the
tap
over
the
bottle
it
seemed
to
have
more
depth
this
small
bottle
version
is
much
much
better
than
the
25
ouncer
imo
this
beer
is
completely
different
from
the
st
b
12
and
i
dont
know
if
i
dont
like
it
better
today
i
like
it
very
much
quite
impressive
d
a
solid
dubbel
very
enjoyable
lovely
chestnut
brown
with
a
creamy
dense
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
sublime
with
dark
fruits
roasted
malts
yeast
and
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
notes
of
chocolate
raisins
and
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
with
well
balanced
carbonation
this
is
the
best
dubbel
i
have
had
from
what
may
be
my
favorite
brewery
this
was
part
of
a
saint
bernardus
variety
case
which
was
pricey
but
worth
it
treat
yourself
almost
too
thin
of
a
mouthfeel
but
the
strong
belgian
carbonation
helps
create
an
unreal
smoothness
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
could
manage
much
beyond
the
twelve
oz
ive
consumed
i
admit
im
rarely
wowed
by
any
dubbel
but
this
is
a
great
job
from
an
amazing
brewery
a
very
nice
beer
it
manages
to
be
extremely
full
flavored
yet
very
smooth
i
will
have
to
try
westy
8
again
but
as
i
recall
i
like
this
beer
much
better
review
translated
from
french
10262008
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
but
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
more
than
2
in
one
evening
a
medium
dark
golden
brown
with
reddish
highlights
moderately
cloudy
and
produces
a
very
big
persistent
somewhat
sticky
head
carbonation
is
significant
somewhat
fizzy
like
a
weisbier
but
found
it
pleasant
smell
is
yeasty
and
balanced
taste
and
mouthfeel
slightly
caramel
yeasty
moderately
creamy
with
a
slightly
pepperish
tang
to
the
sides
of
the
tongue
alcoholic
dimension
is
noticable
but
not
unpleasant
taste
continues
to
evolve
for
several
moments
this
beer
makes
a
big
impression
coating
of
yeast
on
bottom
at
the
end
o
much
like
the
pater
6
this
beer
is
a
joy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easy
cheers
d
enjoyed
this
one
no
surprise
given
their
other
beers
balance
was
very
good
and
was
easy
to
drink
drinkability
good
beer
not
spectacular
but
very
good
the
rating
here
would
be
a
bit
higher
if
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
powerful
definitely
worth
a
try
though
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
a
nice
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
stays
forever
stickiness
well
the
head
is
enormous
and
stays
that
way
and
leaves
its
mark
on
the
sides
smell
is
complex
yeasty
goodness
dark
fruits
banana
brown
sugar
molasses
and
fresh
honey
very
rich
and
full
on
the
nose
i
know
i
couldnt
get
all
the
smells
because
there
are
so
many
but
hey
i
tried
taste
starts
off
a
bit
metallic
which
i
didnt
enjoy
that
much
once
that
goes
away
some
sweet
caramel
sweetness
takes
over
some
nut
bread
flavors
blend
well
with
the
fig
and
raisins
good
taste
but
the
westy
has
the
edge
in
taste
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
carbonation
not
as
pillowy
as
the
westy
8
but
still
pretty
good
im
drinking
a
750
ml
bottle
and
i
dont
see
a
probelm
finishing
it
at
all
good
dubbel
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelves
an
amazing
belgian
brew
from
st
bernardus
who
know
a
thing
or
two
when
it
comes
to
making
them
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
highly
recommended
overall
great
beer
not
as
good
as
the
abt
12
but
still
a
solid
brew
i
would
definetely
try
this
beer
again
had
this
one
at
a
beer
tasting
at
a
friends
house
he
claimed
to
not
be
a
belgian
ale
fan
which
i
dont
get
but
to
each
his
own
this
one
was
excellent
poured
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
fluffy
head
on
top
nose
was
lots
of
dried
fruit
raisins
in
particular
and
that
cookie
scent
common
to
a
lot
of
belgian
dark
beers
flavor
is
similar
lots
of
cookies
a
dose
of
chocolate
honey
butter
deliciousness
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
in
there
body
was
full
and
creamy
appropriately
carbonated
i
really
liked
this
one
not
quite
at
the
level
of
the
12
but
a
very
tasty
dubbel
decided
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
to
celebrate
the
arrival
of
the
ba
september
magazine
on
my
doorstep
and
their
profile
of
this
style
poured
in
to
a
large
red
wine
glass
a
brownish
red
color
with
a
beautiful
white
head
that
lasts
throughout
lots
of
tiny
air
bubbles
make
their
way
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
aroma
has
traces
of
buttery
sweet
bread
brownies
and
dark
fruits
such
as
plum
and
date
taste
reveals
tons
of
fruit
dates
and
figs
being
the
most
pronounced
of
the
bunch
sweet
honey
can
be
tasted
in
the
middle
followed
by
the
sweet
bready
character
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
medium
in
body
seems
like
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
abv
might
catch
up
to
me
after
this
glass
is
finished
a
lovely
dubbel
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
tried
in
a
long
time
would
pair
well
with
any
hearty
meal
i
am
sure
drinkability
i
can
drink
this
all
night
d
a
tasty
and
worthwhile
brew
i
do
prefer
the
pater
6
as
far
as
dubbels
go
though
in
summation
yes
yes
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
within
a
fantastic
style
and
i
couldnt
be
more
vague
and
specific
in
its
spectacularity
than
that
hazy
dark
crimson
hue
creamy
thick
beige
head
loose
lace
soft
yeasty
aroma
w
subtle
notes
of
fig
and
cinnamon
hints
of
chocolate
and
raisiny
sweetness
mellow
dark
caramel
and
banana
esters
as
well
in
aroma
bourbon
laced
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
nutty
malt
and
hints
of
toffee
dark
ripe
figs
and
prunes
add
a
dark
fruity
overlay
well
calculated
light
bitterness
leaves
a
pleasant
residual
sweetness
moderate
in
body
and
mearly
perfectly
smooth
in
mouthfeel
understated
banana
esters
and
clove
finishes
w
a
hint
of
buttery
malt
and
fading
yeast
must
prior

is
quite
a
tasty
brew
its
not
overly
complex
but
rather
soft
and
tremendously
balanced
akin
to
a
milder
version
of
rochefort

most
worthy
of
a
750

thanks
to
my
neighbor
across
the
way
for
sharing
this
belgian
delight
comment
i
must
confess
that
i
am
a
fan
of
the
magic
that
comes
from
brouwerij
st
bernardus
i
rank
the
quad
among
the
best
and
the
tripel
is
close
to
if
not
the
best
in
my
estimation
however
this
effort
is
admirable¬Öit
smells
great
tasks
wonderful
but
its
malty
sweetness
limits
its
drinkability
mdmedium
bodied
full
flavored
very
complexput
this
one
up
with
a
bottle
of
wine
and
moderately
clean
mouthfeel
for
a
such
big
beer
the
label
is
different
now
drinkability
a
nice
sipping
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
there
is
a
strong
alcohol
presence
that
can
sneak
up
on
you
due
to
the
malty
sweetness
good
stuff
beautiful
dark
bodied
pour
with
a
modest
head
that
has
great
retention
and
outstanding
presence
the
smell
is
the
weakest
link
yet
still
pleasant
with
some
noteworthy
spices
lacking
in
complexity
but
still
smoothly
simple
the
taste
is
remarkable
with
just
enough
of
a
dark
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
syrupy
flavoring
that
fades
quickly
but
would
make
a
delicious
pairing
with
sharp
cheeses
the
mouthfeel
could
not
be
more
balanced
if
it
tried
with
a
light
character
and
a
hint
of
dry
carbonation
delightful
and
delicious
prior

is
very
enjoyable
and
surprisingly
quite
drinkable
d
st
bernardus
knows
good
beer
nuff
said
drinkabilitynot
quite
the
abt
12
but
just
on
the
heels
and
good
enough
to
still
score
a
5
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
and
one
i
would
gladly
drink
everyday
of
my
life
nice
heady
beer
that
is
must
drink
especially
if
you
love
the
best
belgian
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
forming
a
thick
1
inch
head
medium
spots
of
lace
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
malt
dark
fruit
aromas
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
malts
dark

and
a
bit
of

very
drinkable

overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
dubbel
as
i
have
been
with
all
the
brews
i
have
tried
from
st
bernardus
full
complex
flavor
highly
recommended
overall
a
great
beer
these
abbey
brews
cant
be
beat
the
bottles
can
be
somewhat
pricey
mine
was
3
99
but
this
brew
is
well
worth
it
d
since
it
tastes
wellrounded
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
id
say
this
is
one
drinkable
beer
another
great
belgian
from
st
bernardus
flavor
was
a
superb
dubel
lots
of
rich
malts
belgian
sugars
provided
a
nice
solid
base
to
this
beer
dark
fruits
such
as
prunes
and
dark
cherries
bits
of
dark
grabes
and
dried
raisins
too
could
not
pick
out
any
heat
from
the
alcohol
at
all
but
it
sure
hit
m
pretty
good
vinuous
and
heavy
mouthfel
that
did
a
great
job
just
coating
the
cheeks

that
is
inhanced
by
the

active
carbonation
on

a
high
quality
beer
as
expected
drinkability
is
good
considering
the
high
abv
the
taste
is
strong
enough
to
take
notice
but
not
overpowering
or
so
sweet
that
it
becomes
annoying
after
a
while
not
an
everyday
beer
but
very
enjoyable
poured
from
a
corked
magnum
into
a
brandy
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
not
quite
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
great
head
that
lasted
and
left
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
dried
fruits
malts
and
some
candi
sugar
the
taste
was
dominated
by
dried
fruits
with
some
molasses
and
dark
malts
the
beer
was
rather
heavy
and
the
alcohol
was
present
this
one
took
me
a
while
but
i
did
enjoy
it
dark
brown
with
a
thick
dense
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
dark
candi
sugar
delicious
sweet
chocolate
and
treacle
flavours
with
berry
fruitiness
full
bodied
an
outstanding
complex
sweet
dark
ale
as
good
as
the
12
a
tasty
beer
to
savour
wouldnt
drink
lots
of
these
but
every
once
in
a
while
itd

pretty
good

murky
brown
with

small

to
a

floral
and
fruity
hops
balanced
by
sweet
malts
herbs
honey
brown
sugar
t
more
sweet

those
belgian

i¬íve
grown
to

d
this
one
just
has
a
good
overall
feel

flavor
i
enjoyed
it
d
i
really
like
it
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
fruits
and
less
malts
and
also
didnt
have
the
champagne
carbonation
feel
to
it
other
than
those
2
things
it
is
very
nice
i
do
think
i
prefer
their
triple
though
even
though
i
usually
prefer
dubbels
drinkability
is
good
given
the
abv
the
mouthfeel
is

and
the
carbonation

2fl
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
the
aroma
is
perfect
sweet
bready
malt
yeast
and
dark
fruit
make
up
the
rather
enticing
nose
the
taste
explodes
with
sweet
malt
dough
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
is
a
superb
representation
of
the
dubbel
style
that
is
highly
recommended
this
is
an
outstanding
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
if
there
ever
was
one
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
slightly
cloudy
with
some
yeasty
bits
floating
on
the
bottom
nice
head
great
lacing
the
head
is
an
off
white
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
fruity
sweet
somewhat
malty
aroma
and
the
taste
wont
disappoint
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
a
little
yeasty
wonderful
fruits
popping
through
not
too
much
hop
flavor
except
maybe
on
the
end
it
is
your
typical
belgian
in
that
there
are
plenty
of
candied
sugars
used
in
the
fermentation
and
that
is
what
makes
this
beer
what
it
is
the
after
taste
is
smooth
there
is
some
alcohol
notes
coming
through
too
but
mostly
on
the
end
but
not
really
that
much
for
a
beer
with
8
abv
it
actually
hides
its
rather
highish
alcohol
content
very
well
this
is
just
a
wonderful
beer
lchaim
beer
decanted
perfectly
into
my
duvel
glass
it
poured
a
ruby
brown
color
with
yeast
sediment
visible
with
a
perfect
long
lasting
off
white
head
nose
is
splendid
of
bananas
sweet
malts
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
nose
with
a
drying
hop
finish
the
alcohol
is
ever
so
slightly
warming
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
fairly
full
and
very
smooth
drinkability
is
near
perfect
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
representation
of
the
dubbel
style
drinkability
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
despite
the
big
abv
drinkability
is
good
nothing
wrong
with
putting
a
few
of
these
away
d
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
for
8
abv
a
superb
choice
in
a
belgian
the
12
is
still
superior
overall
but
this
is
a
worthy
alternative
a
very
nice
beer
i
like

poured
into
a
chalice
with
a
multicolored
head
thats
stained
several
shades
of
koolaid
interestingly
this
beer
was
much
much
darker
in
the
glass
that
it
was
in
the
bottle
a
simple
review
of
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
would
consist
of
two
words
beer
pez
sickeningly
saccharine
sweet
with
noticable
candi
sugar
priming
this
beer
has
many
similar
elements
evident
in
the
quadruppel
but
somehow
they
come
across
as
flaws
here
carmel
malt
pez
candy
is
the
obvious
one
sugar
in
the
raw
mouthfeel
is
too
chalky
for
the
body
another
flaw
i
dont
mind
with
the
12
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
too
much
flavor
and
not
enough
of
the
right
flavors
not
for
me
walnut
colored
body
topped
by
a
great
clinging
tan
head
aroma
is
sweet
with
nice
fruity
scents
a
touch
of
oaken
vanilla
and
caramelized
sugars
flavor
is
complex
with
cherry
fruit
vanilla
caramel
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
and
figs
a
slight
bitterness
shows
through
then
more
sweet
malt
and
fruit
flavors
come
through
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
pretty
much
perfect
carbonation
drinkability
is
superb
this
is
definitely
a
great
experience
the
pater
is
good
but
this
is
twice
as
nice
ill
certainly
have
to
try
it
again
and
as
good
as
it
was
it
was
not
quite
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
this
dubbel
is
thick
and
syrupy
lingering
on
the
tongue
for
a
bit
the
best
by
date
on
the
bottle
is
040810
if
only
i
had
the
patience
to
wait
that
long
before
trying
the
next
one

2

a
beautiful
huge
fluffy
and
rocky

maintains
a

throughout
the

quite
intense
and
pleasant
aromas
of
fresh

ripe

caramel
candies
toffee
along
with
faint
hints
of
buckwheat

is
full
and
round
combining
a
nice
spritzy
carbonation
with
an
enjoyable
chewy
texture
flavor
profile
seems
a
bit
more
reserved
compared
to
the

still
quite
good
notes
of

belgian
crystal
malts
light
brown
sugar
caramel

fresh

ripe

savored
finish

just
a
quick
hit
of
hops
and
alcohol

unfortunately
tends
to
fade
out
fast
leaning
toward
some
thiness
in
the
end
all
in
all
a
well
done
belgain
dubble
and
would
certainly
visit
this
again

cheers
poured
from
a
corked
and
caged
750
ml
bottle
into
my
ommegang
chalice
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
awesome
head
very
light
and
fluffy
sticking
to
the
sides
it
doesnt
erupt
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
but
it
doesnt
settle
quickly
either
perfect
the
color
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
had
expected
most
other
dubbels
ive
had
were
very
dark
brown
you
can
actually
see
the
carbonation
in
this
stuff
the
aroma
is
very
bready
im
a
little
worried
the
taste
will
be
the
same
nope
the
taste
is
awesome
very
sweet
like
brown
sugar
with
a
perfect
balance
of
bitterness
slight
alcohol
taste
that
is
smooth
and
rich
very
silky
mouthfeel
this
is
better
than
i
had
expected
minus
the
bready
smell
this
is
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
ever
had
fresh
pastry
dough
with
a
dash
of
yeast
faint
currant
flavor
with
hints
of
glazed
donut
this
is
like
a
glass
of
your
favorite
local
donut
shop
at
three
in
the
morning
when
they
are
cranking
out
the
next
days
pastries
i
recommend
that
you
drink
it
at
three
in
the
morning
or
at
least
before
bedtime
i
can
really
get
into
these
flavors
and
im
generally
over
dark
strong
bottled
conditioned
belgian
beers
good
job
solid
my
first
of
this
beer
and
i
must
admit
im
impressed
much
smoother
and
warmly
maltier
than
i
was
anticipating
a
great
beer
i
thought
the
hearty
ale
would
be
perfect
to
be
snowed
in
with
but
i
would

better
than

ive
tried

abt
this

is
a
rather
fine
dubbel
it
pours
from
the

a
nice
dark
color
with
a
minimal
head
which
sadly
does
not
last
the

is
of

was

the

of

taste
is
of

it
the

is
not

noticable

would
suggest

citrus

it

very
little

an
exceedingly
smooth
brew
with
a
slight
hint
of
carbonation
just
right
very
enjoyable
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
good
drinkability
the
carbonation
on
this
even
though
not
immediately
apparent
comes
out
in
the
flavor
making
for
a
slightly
more
crisp
beer
the
acidity
is
really
nice
i
can
totally
imagine
eating
cheese
and
crackers
with
this
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
way
to
start
a
dinner
with
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
especially
for
my
next
dinner
party
again
this
is
not
an
over
the
top
beer
i
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
not
a
punch
in
the
face
but
a
subtle
beer
you
can
eat
and
hang
with
not
that
i
dont
love
their
tripel

but
those
should
be
used

i
love

saint
bernardus
drinkability
good
but
not
exceptional
in
a
word
underwhelming
although
a
good
beer
i
found
nothing
to
brag
about
it
looks
like
a
nice
monk
brew
brown
with
generous
head
smell
didnt
do
much
for
me
some
fruit
and
caramel
but
it
was
faint
similarly
with
tastes
there
were
some
nice
subtle
complexities
but
nothing
grand
and
tasty
it
was
a
mix
of
tart
sour
berries
with
bitter
candy
i
had
a
hard
time
tasting
much
because
the
beer
was
over
carbonated
really
took
a
while
for
that
to
settle
down
still
a
very
smooth
drink
but
not
one
id
drop
good
money
on
any
time
soon
ill
stick
to
the
abt
12
a
nice
ale
though
a
bit
more
bland
than
some
of
its
other
family
members
this
beer
is
a
onetrick
pony
it
offers
one
taste
which
is
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
raisin
carob
molasses
im
not
sure
but
its
a
little
too
rustic
for
my
taste
ill
try
this
again
in
a
few
months
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
bottle
it
just
may
be
that
few
other
beers
so
typically
fit
into
the
dubbel
style
with
such
a
strong
pedigree
and
the
pedigree
is
well
earned
while
the
abv
is
healthy
its
also
a
nicely
incorporated
warming
component
and
it
drinks
so
very
nicely
so
this
is
on
more
impressive
offering
from
the
pride
of
watou
province
a
very
nice
abbey

like
this

for

this
is

drinkable
a
very
good

is
marginal

i
have
tried
this

both

to

that
ill
find

i
felt
somewhat
guilty
to
take
the
single
bottle
from

fridge
this
certainly
is
one
of
those
gems
that
you
come
across
once
in
awhile
lovely
dark
brown
color
full
head
slowly
receding
and
a
taste
that
i
hadnt
experienced
before
definitely
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
tried
slightly
murky
amber
color
slight
spicy

some

the

was

some

particles
good
thick
tan
head
that
lingered
throughout
and
excellent
lacing
aroma
was
strongly
dark
fruit
grapes
plums
figs
and
the
flavor
was
more
of
this
along
with
the
malty
sweetness
early
on
as
beer
warmed
at
midglass
alcohol
became
more
evident
in
both
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
pretty
much
what
i
expected
not
the
best
for
a
hot
summer
night
like
tonite
but
there
is
no
mistaking
the
good
aroma
flavor
and
overall
quality
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
also
earthy
the
yeast
adds
a
slight
sourness
that
combines
with
the
earthy
base
mouthfeel
i
would
place
on
medium
of
the
entire
spectrum
from
light
lager
to
stout
it
falls
in
between
overall
you
must
have
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
extremely
tasty
an
excellent
watou
ale
in
the
shade
of
its
older
brother
the
abbot
this
is
another
winner
from
watou
highly
reccomended
drinkability
is
very
nice
its
a
strong
beer
but
not
a
knockout
the
flavors
blend
really
well
together
im
thinking
of
a
ton
of
food
pairings
that
would
work
from
sweet
deserts
to
spicey
chilis
and
i
think
all
would
work
well
but
its
also
got
enough
heft
to
be
a
sipper
by
itself
this
is
the
star
of
the
st
bernardus
line
i
m
o
dubbel
light
is
the
best
description
of
this
beer
it
doesnt
do
much
for
me
it
looks
and
smells
nice
but
has
a
very
one
dimensional
taste
too
dry
and
it
has
minimal
residual
sugars
like
shiraz
that
is
steeped
in
tobacco
im
not
inclined
to
buy
it
again
quite
drinkable
for
an
8
brew
although
its
thickness
and
carbonation
hold
it
back
somewhat
still
for
pure
drinking
pleasure
this
one
is
fantastic
much
closer
to
the
abt
12
calibre
than
the
pater

sampled
with
the
witbier
while
watching
the
mlb
all
star
game
tonight
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
the
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
color
medium
tan
head
and
strong
lacing
the
nose
has
some
fine
tones
of
brown
sugar
and
raisins
maybe
plums
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
toasted
malty
kick
and
a
bit
bready
there
is
no
real
notice
of
the
abv
while
tasting
which
is
nice
but
it
eventually
shows
up
medium
body
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
muddy
brownish
purple
with
a
large
frothy
head
that
recedes
slowly
pleasant
sweet
cherry
cola
like
aroma
with
a
dusting
of
plums
and
raisins
dark
fruits
and
doughy
funnel
cake
or
whatever
greasy
fried
confection
you
prefer
sans
the
powdered
sugar
embody
the
flavor
the
dark
fruits
provide
a
subtle
tartness
balanced
by
bittersweet
toffeedark
chocolate
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
in
the
flavor
though
my
head
has
found
it
carbonation
nips
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
is
in
no
way
overdone
or
what
i
would
consider
overly
or
highly
carbonated
rather
its
quite
smooth
another
stellar
brew
from
this
master
belgian
brewer
poured
a
warm
tone
of
amber
head
was
smallish
with
furious
carbonation
i
smelled
the
nose
even
before
i
finished
pouring
the
dominant
tone
was
almonds
and
raisins
i
also
get
sweet
brown
sugar
the
smell
is
so
damned
rich
i
dont
know
what
to
compare
it
to
other
than
a
freshly
baked
home
made
pie
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
plus
an
added
pleasant
tartness
this
is
somewhat
highly
carbonated
making
for
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
one
that
would
certainly
please
me
when
i
thirst
for
a
dubbel
drinkability
ridiculously
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
and
the
copperymetallic
finish
to
the
malts
balanced
and
smooth
this
beer
would
be
a
great
session
beer
or
one
to
sit
on
for
a
while
highly
recommend
i
might
have
to
give
this
another
try
but
based
on
this
introductory
bottle
this
beer
is
easily
consumed
but
doesnt
taste
all
that
special
i
had
higher
hopes
considering
how
fantastic
the
12
is
still
looking
forward
to
the
trippel
a
highly
enjoyable
brew
and
certainly
ranks
right
up
with
the
best
dubbels
ive
had
my
first
experience
with
this
style
and
particualr
beer
was
very
good
aroma
was
nutty
yet
clean
taste
was
of
walnuts
and
slightly
buttery
very
drinkable
for
a
8
beer
i
can
normally
taste
the
alcolhol
of
any
beer
over
6
but
prior
8
was
different
great
head
and
head
retention
great
lace
on
the
glass
overall
very
enjoyable
and
i
will
definitely
have
more
in
the
future
well
compared
to
the
drink
til
you
are
dead
nectar
that
is
the
abt
12
this
is
utterly
forgettable
next
time
ill
be
sure
to
purchase
this
in
the
750ml
package
to
see
if
this
was
just
a
case
of
poorhandling
or
excessive
age
a
major
improvement
over
its
little
brother
pater
6
this
beer
has
a
good
reputation
and
really
lives
up
to
it
this
is
a
fine
dubbel
and
what
chimay
red
should
aspire
to
looks
great
smells
great
goes
down
smooth
i
have
to
admit
that
dubbels
arent
my
favorite
style
by
a
long
shot
but
i
enjoyed
the
prior
8
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
at
8abv
alcohol
is
in
great
balance
with
the
beers
flavors
overall
it
is
rather
similar
to
the
pater
6
i
liked
that
one
better
though
although
dubbels
are
hardly
one
of
my
goto
styles
quality
beer
such
as
this
shows
just
who
the
others
are
chasing
excellent
its
hard
to
put
into
words
the
overall
beauty
of
something
so
phenomenal
but
i
guess
the
numbers
will
have
to
speak
for
themselves
for
now
excellent
excellent
beer
i
cant
recommend
this
one
highly
enough
aged
as
this
one
was
this
is
an
interesting
brew
very
malty
slight
lacing
nice
fruity
smell
lots
of
apricots
and
plums
again
extremely
interesting
a
little
overpriced
almost
more
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
than
a
dubbel
for
me
a
little
too
strong
for
a
dubbel
but
still
a
tremendous
brew
nice
pillowy
head
little
carbonation
and
the
head
dissapates
quickly
hey
if
you
cam
find
a
single
go
for
it
d
tasty
and
drinkable
enough
just
feel
that
there
is
something
missing
when
comparing
it
to
others
in
the
style
just
what
i
look
for
in
a
dubbel
hard
to
beat
probably
my
favourite
of
the
st
bernardus
beers
ive
tried
including
the
abt
12
pours
out
a
cloudy
deep
amber
with
a
fatto
bo
batty
head
leaves
some
nice

smells
sweet
with
some
doses
of
alcohol
hovering
right
about
the
rim
taste

niiice
malty
oh
so
malt
doughybread
like
malt
dark
fruits
and
some
brown
sugar
crisp
lovely
carbonation
champagne
like
deadly
in
its
drinkability
this
stuff
is
the
real
deal
pours
a
two
finger
thick
cream
head
that
barely
fades
leaving
a
good

cloudy
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium

this

with
some

could

this
is
a

this

better

wins
again
the
strong
aroma
and
dark
color
leads
one
to
expect
a
fullbodied
malty
sweet
meal
in
a
glass
but
this
beer
is
instead
very
dry
and
subdued
on
the
palatetoo
subdued
for
my
taste
still
a
very
clean
and
balanced
beer
that
in
true
belgian
style
is
extremely
drinkable

its
powerful
punch
awesome

expected
mostly
a
bready
yeasty
with
hints
of
fruits
and
alcohol
fruity
tastes
up

maybe
green
apples
malts
and
spices
more
flavors
show
themselves
as
the
beer
warms
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
i
mean
very
smooth
leaves
you
wanting
more
even
with
a
8
abv
this
is
so
easy
too
drink
and
an
absolute
pleasure
my
second
offering
from
st
bernadus
and
a
definite
winner
pours
dark
reddish
thick

fruity
odors
almost
like
strawberries
whoo
very
strong
lots
of

peaty
flavor
alcohol
is
very
evident
which
makes
me
think
we
should
have
held
onto
the
bottle
a
bit
longer
i
had
this
problem
with
the
abt
12
too
a
bit
too
harsh
for
me
in
its
current
state
nice
full
mouthfeel
good
but
too
much
would
knock
me
flat

with
the
other
st

offerings
this
one
is
a
sipper
an
excellent
nightcap
which
is
how
i
am
enjoying
this
one
it
really
warms
the
body
as
i
sip

is
plenty

the
one
is
very
drinkable

is

a

anyone
not

this
just
ok
not
a

for

final
thoughts
all
in
all
a
solid
and
well
made
dubbel
that
might
have
gotten
off
to
a
bit
of
a
rocky
start
but
to
me
makes
up
for
it
where
it
counts
for

i
cant

think
it
would
go
well
with

up

very

one
of
the
hits
of

was

if

hadnt
tapped
this

so
quickly
i
think
i
could
have
finished
most
of
it
myself
full
of
flavor
but
not
so
strong
that
youll
regret
having
a
whole
bottle
to
yourself
i
think
this
would
have
paired
well
with
a
wide
range
of
food
as
well
ill
have
to
pick
this
up
again
and
savor
it
some
more
overall
delicious
and
a
great
dubbel
and
possibly
the
best
ive
had
for
the
style
the
prior

this

is

brew
that
all
fans
of
trappiststyle
ales
should
consider
well
worth
a
try
nothing
specific
about
this
beers
flavour
profile
jumps
out
at
me
instead
everything
blends
beautifully
into
a
harmonious
whole
one
that
can
seem
deceptively
straightforward
at
first
however
it
opens
up
as
the
glass
warms
and
reveals
itself
to
be
the
uppertier
dubbel
that
it
most
assuredly
is
great
stuff
ive
never
seen
this
available
in
single
format
locally
but
it
would
quickly
become
a
goto
dubbel
if
that
were
to
change
overall
a
very
pleasant
dubbel
easily
enjoyed
with
mild
cheeses
and
less
fatty
cuts
of
meat
a
solid
beer
and
one
i
would
enjoy
again
o
a
very
complex

with
a
very
well
hidden
alcohol
making
it
easy
to
drink
and
it
is

to
want
to

over

over

very
good
beer
my
first
time
trying
this
i
was
not
disappointed
the
feel
was
the
only
downfall
very
carbonated
other
than
that
i
cant
find
any
fault
with
this
beer

since
it

with
about
one
finger
of
offwhite

the
head
settles
down
to
a
thin
cap
that
lasts
well
into
the
beer
the
aroma
is
mild
with
both
sweet
malt
and
spice
like
a
christmas
bread
but
without
the
nutmeg
or
cinnamon
savory
the
taste
is
similar
but
a
little
subdued
the
body
is
lighter
and
lacking
in
the
unctuousness
of
others
dubbels
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
o
an
excellent
beer
sweet
and
loaded
with
flavour
but
has
an
ample
amount
of
bitterness
after
each
sip
a
very
well
rounded
dubbel
no
shortage
of
yeasty
spice
and
complexity
here
a
hefty
flavour
profile
that
has
a
strong
malt
and
caramel
profile
but
also
plays
well
to
the
yeast
delightful
beer
well
balanced
and
quite
approachable
quite
a
peppery
dubbel
and
one
i
will
look
forward
to
having
again
overall
a
classic
good
one
just
curious
if
it
is
always
this
carbonated
and
fizzy
the
rest
a
nice
solid
dubble
nice

just
a
hell
of
a
complex

with
great

none

i
found
the

to

then
some

aggressive
phenols
carry
through
right
to
the
end
the
alcohol
peeks
through
from
time
to
time
and
i
am
feeling
that
the
heavy
carbonation
might
be
muting
and
blending
the
flavor

together
somewhere
in
here
there
are
scottishlike

all
trying

for

which
is

well

either
quietly
stated
very

on

this
is
a

i

compare
it

i
would
select
the

out

10
times
ahead
of
this

very

the
high
carbonation
detracts
a
little
for
me
but
im
sure
it
is
good
with
some
age
on
it
classic
example
of
the
style
a
really
pleasant

it
was
definitely

really
well
done
you
can
tell
the
brewmasters
are
keen
on
quality
had
one
these
for
the
last
eight
years
and
i
have
never
been
disappointed
an
everyday
belgian
no
matter
what
season
of
the
year
overall
an
exceptional
example
of
the
style
it
has
that
nice
marriage
of
malty
flavors
dark
fruits
and
that
distinctive
puff
pastry
flavor
characteristic
of
belgian
yeast
i
generally
reach
for
quads
instead
of
dubbels
but
im
very
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
beer
it
is
outstanding
o
solid
well
made
true
to
style
and
very
drinkable
o
as
i
said
before
its
one
of
the
better
dubbels
ive
tried
thats
not
saying
much
but
it
is
good
and
well
worth
a
try
recommended
overall
a
good
dubbel
kind
of
toned
down
in
the
dark

id
drink
this
one

i
appreciate

it

this
is
one
of
the

pater
6
is
a
pseudoantithesis
to
the
aforementioned
you
dont
have
to
agree
with
the
profile
that
has
been
given
to
this
beer
but
i
have
led
many
beer
tastings
with
this
as
the
dubbel
of
choice
sometimes
and
no
one
has
ever
asked
for
their
dos
equis
amber
ale
back
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
fairly
high
intensity
resulting
in
a
beer
that
is
fizzy
at
first
eventually
creating
a
mass
of
foamy
bubbles
upon
the
palate
closes
semidry
with
moderate
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
overall
i
am
not
very
impressed
by
this
dubbel
it
really
lacks
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
along
with
a
weak
mouthfeel
i
feel
like
this
could
be
a
whole
lot
better
with
a
little
bit
of
work
its
an
ok
beer
jd
solid
dubbel
nice
balance
of
sweetness
earthiness
and
bitterness
although
i
think
it
may
slightly
be
overrated
i
prefer
the
prior
8
by
a
few
miles
over
this
one
so
if
youre
ever
in
a
pickle
between
the
two
go
for
the
8
this
is
still
a
nice
brew
to
try
once
though
and
the
lighter

tax
is
nice
o
good
beer
good
flavors
strong
dubbel
this
isnt
a
master
piece
like
their
12
or
the

this
a
very
nice
beer
if
the
price
werent
near

a

pack
on
this
6

beer
i
might
grab
one
from
time
to
time
othis
beer
is
unmistakably
and
deliciously
belgian
the
sweet
flavors
are
indeed
sweet
and
there
are
fruit
components
but
it
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
like
a
lot
of
the
strongerflavored
american
interpretations
of
a
dubbel
a
fine
example
of
restraint
in
beermaking
overall
impression
its
a
good
beer
but
quite
a
shock
at
first
taste
my
nose
and
my
tongue
went
in
opposite
directions
its
a
good
solid
brew
but
one
of
the
weaker
belgians
especially
considering
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
it
was
fun
to
try
but
to
honest
i
doubt
i
would
ever
buy
it
again
o
a
flavorful
balanced
dubbel
easy
to
drink
a
little
bit
lighter
body
compared
to
the
8
but
it
holds
its
own
great
brew

this

tastes

along
with

an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
nice
belgian
the
aroma
was
brown
sugar
smell
with
some
fruit
and
spice
the
taste
was
similar

a
solid

backing
with
a

carbonated

very

i
could

these
with

love

drink

drinkable
it
could

beer

still
has
great
flavor
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
treat
i
found
stashed
in

it
was
quite
good

may
have
been
even
better
had
it
been
a
fresh
bottle
another
heavenly
offering
from

overall
fantastic
surprisingly
my
second
favorite
behind
the
abt
12
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
d
a
nice
beer
indeed
not
something
id
drink
regularly
but
nice
on
the
odd

d
if
i

this

would

it

it

taste
is

spiced
the
carbonation
is

though
tasty
this
isnt
a
repeatedly
drinkable
beer
id
highly
recommend
one
cuz
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
drink
two
in
a
sitting
color
is
a
dark
cola
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
light
tan
head
with
a
few
speckles
in
it

mildly
of
apples
and
other
sweet
fruits
tastes

different
fruits
like
apple
grape
fig
berry
with
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
thrown
in
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
beer
just
a
bit
too
mild
for
my
tastes
d
this
brew
is
pretty
drinkable
has
some
great
flavor
and
a
low
abv
makes
this
a
very
accessible
brew
really
enjoyed
it
d
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
had
definitely
could
be
a

taste
is

followed
by

which
comes
out
in
the
taste
the
taste
is
overwhelmingly
dried
fruit
with
prunes
and
raisins
standing
out
over
everything
else
very
bubbly
mouthfeel
low
abv
makes
this
beer
drinkable
and
pretty
damn
delicious
if
i
do
say
so
myself
overall
not
st
bernardus
best
offering
but
worth
the
try
nonetheless
this
beers
superb
mouthfeel
is
defined
by
the
extremely
fine
carbonation
that
creates
a
luxurious
palate
without
a
heavy
body
d
better
than
average
but
i
expect
more
from
belgians
especially
st
bernardus
overall
quite
drinkable
enjoyable
not
a
great
dubbel
but
worth
a
try
this
dubble
has
a
medium
body
with
more
than
adequate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
but
it
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
st
bernardus
family
of
beers
this
was
the
first
st
bernardus
beer
that
i
have
tried
it
was
served
in
a
standard
beer
mug
at
first
the
head
was
about
1
thick
that
disappeared
pretty
fast
however
the
lacing
was
good
and
lasted
the
whole
way
down
the
color
was
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
it
smelled
sweet
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
did
not
really
reflect
the
smell
it
was
much
more
bitter
but
in
a
good
way
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
will
be
trying
more
of
st
bernardus
soon
all
in
all
a
mixed
start
to
my
evening
of
tastings
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
while
this
one
is
a
great
beer
on
its
own
i
expect
no
less
from
the
heavier
8
of
course
my
chalice
is
empty
but
thanks
for
another
great
time
bernie
overall
and
excellant
brew
with
great
drinability
will
be
sure
to
pick
this
one
up
again
st

6
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
almost
red
and
brown
at
the
same
time
the
aroma
is
sweet
malty
dark
fruits
with
a
mild
yeasty
phenolic
quality
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
bready
biscuity
malt
upfront
there
is
a
rounded
bitterness
that
balances
the
beer
nicely
the
finish
is
sharp
with
dark
fruity
esters
reminiscent
of
raisins
or
plums
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
addition
to
the
mix
pack
im
glad
to
get
the
chance
to
try
it
amazing
lacing
on
this
beer
color
wise
it
pours
similar
to
it
big
brother
abt
12
muddy
brown
with
an
amber
tinge
aroma
is
quite
nice
and
complex
flowers
are
the
first
note
that
hits
me
followed
by
vanilla
raisin
ginger
anise
cinnamon
and
some
yeast
and
very
very
slight
cereal
notes
flavor
is
pleasant
and
refreshing
but
nothing
to
special
has
a
nutty
finish
i
poured
one
glass
at
38f
and
one
at
the
recommended
48f
i
find
that
it
tastes
better
at
the
colder
38
but
the
aroma
really
comes
alive
at
proper
cellar
temperatures
d
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
for
the
winter
days
my
least
favorite
form
this
brewery
but
still
better
than
most
st

pater
6
pours
a
dark
amberish
brown
it
has
a
nice
fluffy
head
and
a
strong
smell
aromas
are
a
blended
mix
of
mild
fruits
yeast
and
malts
the
taste
offers
subtle
hints
of
fruit
along
with
a
slight
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
highly
carbonated
highly
carbonated
beers
usually
dont
impress
me
but
this
type
of
carbonation
is
different
rather
that
burning
the
mouth
and
bloating
it
gives
a
rather
unique
and
pleasant
tingle
in
the
chest
even
at
6
7
this
would
be
an
easy
one
to
session
i
never
noticed
the
alcohol
and
was
surprised
to
see
it
nearly
7
i
like
this
one
alot
and
will
find
myself
pickin
up
a
few
more
next
time
i
am
in
the
beer
store
a
very
good
dubbel
a
bit
light
at
times
but
refined
with
no
rough
edges
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
at
a
sittingalthough
it
is
meant
to
be
sipped
d
suitable
as
a
nice
sunday
afternoon
ale
a
bit
of
alcohol
punch
but
being
lighter
than
its
bigger
brothers
it
is
more
agreeable
for
casual
drink
without
being
overwhelming
cherry
colored
body
with
thick
offwhite
head
with
tiny
bubbles
and
striped
lace
malty
sour
and
slightly
moldy
smell
not
really
mold
more
like
basement
mild
malt
if
with
sour
aftertaste
that
is
long
lived
and
sits
on
your
tongue
light
to
medium
bodied
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
dry
finish
overall
eastily
drinkable
but
not
terribly
complex
tastes
of
behold
i
think
i
am
developing
a
taste
for
sourfunk
style
european
beers
notes
not
the
best
offering
from
a
usually
stellar
onei
of
my
personal
favorites
brewery
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
overall
this
is
an
unusual
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
may
take
a
bit
of
getting
used
to
worth
a
try
however
i
wouldn¬ít
get
too
excited
about
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
good
enough
that
i
would
seek
it
out
to
often
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
raisiny
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
there
is
little
yeast
fruitiness
present
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
very
dry
crystal
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
with
a
slight
fruitiness
and
finishes
extremely
dry
with
some
roasted
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
not
the
best
effort
from
this
brewery
this
beer
was
tasty
at
the
outset
and
like
many
belgian
ales
became
better
as
it
sat
and
warmed
a
most
enjoyable
beer
i
will
have
to
say
that
this
is
another
strong
brew
by
st
bernardus
these
guys
are
so
consistant
all
of
their
brews
set
the
tone
for
their
intended
style
i
enjoyed
it
tremendously
and
on
a
side
note
i
love
belgian
beer
d
a
nice
lighter
version
of
the
st
bernardus
dubbel
well
balanced
and
complex
and
highly
drinkable
after
another
go
at
this
one
i
still
feel
the
same
their
other
styles
are
so
far
superior
you
wouldnt
think
they
came
from
the
same
shop
after
a
night
of
sampling
st
bernardus
different
brews
its
easy
to
proclaim
this
brewery
one
of
the
worlds
finest
the
entire
line
is
rocksolid
and
imo
worth
the
price
premium
amazing
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
st
bernardus
beers
color
is
a
deep
honey
brown
translucent
and
attractive
aroma
is
strongly
malty
with
a
hint
of
banana
malt
dominates
the
flavor
which
has
a
ribbon
of
hop
bitterness
and
undertones
of
banana
and
cinnamon
texture
is
fairly
smooth
with
a
good
bit
of
tingle
finish
is
pleasant
malty
aftertaste
has
a
decidedly
fruity
tone
d
it
is
an
easy
smooth
creamy
and
low
abv
brew
however
knowing
there
are
much
more
appealing
dubbels
running
around
on
the
loose
would
drive
me
mad
and
limit
my
consumption
to
an
as
available
status
taste
is
dark
fruit
sweet
toasted
malt
berries
apples
caramel
a
little
spice
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
smooth
a
touch
heavy
on
the
carbonation
and
slightly
dry
easy
drinker
especially
for
the
style
purchases
as
part
of
the
holiday
gift
pack
along
with
the
8
trippel
12
and
the
glass
a
good
beer
and
a
very
nice
start
to
this
gift
pack
for
me
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
that
ill
surely
have
again
enjoy
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
orangebrown
with
some
suspended
particles
the
head
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
cap
the
smell
is
sweet
and
has
elements
of
cinammon
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
starts
with
candi
sugar
up
front
followed
by
tangy
belgian
yeast
brown
sugar
dark
dried
fruit

with

i
would
add
that
there
are
some
doughy
caramel
in
the
flavors
there
is
a
bit
of
a
banana
bread
hint
or
two
in
the
beer
less
coriander
more
of
the
doughy
malts
the
prickly
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
more
subdued
than
in
many
other
beers
of
the
style
the
aroma
is
also
better
this
time
around
d
a
beautiful
example
of
the
dubbel
brown
amber
color
a
huge
light
tan
head
foams
up
with
a
huge
burst
of
carbonation
the
head
then
drops
to
a
controlled
rocky
cap
that
has
great
staying
power
smell
is
very
inviting
slight
clove
nuts
and
deap
malt
bready
notes
taste
falls
right
in
to
place
behind
the
smell
very
slight
clove
but
the
standout
is
the
malts
nuttyness
and
dark
breads
with
just
a
hint
of
raisins
and
a
smooth
cocoa
powder
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
heavy
on
the
carbonation
side
but
that
is
to
be
expected
it
mellows
as
it
warms
and
the
smoothness
becomes
more
obvious
this
is
a
smooth
drinker
that
has
to
be
considered
one
of
the
models
for
this
style
cant
imagine
it
getting
a
whole
lot
better
than
this
medium
to
full
bodied
character
coming
out
the
ears
but
still
mighty
drinkable
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
one
finger
plus
creamy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
nice
islands
and
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
can
notice
some
plums
figs
and
raisins
the
taste
is
very
nice
mostly
malty
some
yeast
tones

dark

medium
body
a
very
complex
brew
and
well

indeed
a
drinkable
work
of
art
d
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
but
then
again
this
is
my
first
dubbel
i
am
impressed
and
am
slightly
curious
as
to
why
so
many
american
brewers
try
their
hand
tripels
and
not
so
much
with
the
dubbels
above
average
for
a
beer
in
general
but
given
high
standards
of
belgian
ales
this
one
disappoints
drinkability
whats
up
with
that
andobrew
huh
this
beer
pours
a
deep
reddish
copper
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
otherwise
it
is
a
deep
amber
color
it
is
lightly
hazy
and
is
topped
by
a
creamy
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
musty
complex
and
spicy
to
boot
a
definite
spicy
brew
the
carbonation
tingles
on
my
tongue
as
it
goes
down
this
beer
is
fairly
dry
though
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
here
a
hint
of
alcohol
character
is
in
the
finish
i
get
hints
of
bergamot
ginger
pepper
and
caramel
as
well
as
a
bunch
of
other
flavors
that
i
cannot
quite
pick
out
as
expected
from
this

the

interpretations
d
despite
the
strong
notes
of

it
is
a
nice

its
not

overall
it
was
enjoyable
but
i
think
it
could
be
improved
d
quite
drinkable
goes
down
well
watery
aspects
are
a
plus
the
dry

makes
this
brew
kind
of
special
when
you
expected
sweetness
and
fruitiness
a
nice
try
because
of
this
decent
beer
nice
drinking
this
is
much
better
than
the
zot
blonde
but
not
a
great
belgian
beer
by
any
means
d
pretty
drinkable
but
the
yeast
notes
become
a
bit
cloying
there
are
some
nice
spicy
notes
in
the
finish
and
the
malt
character
is
nice
but
not
too
much
complexity
otherwise
my
biggest
complaint
is
the
excessive
bubblegum
character
of
the
yeast
which
seems
to
be
common
to
this
brewerys
beers
still
it
is
a
pleasant
and
fairly
drinkable
dubbel
i
nice
little
find
that
i
picked
up
on

to

recently
worth
a
try
recommended
thank
you
nicolas
for
the
chance
to
try
this
way
too
easy
to
drink
that
is
for
sure
overall
great
dubbel
the
intial
taste
is
not
all
that
spectacular
but
the
rest
of
the
experience
is
great
very
drinkable
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
for
sure
highly
recommended
this
dubbel
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
though
and
if
you
ever

wonderful

this

it
it
easily
competes
with

and
imo
beats
out
chimay
and
maudite
even
though
its
a

it

is
common

the
style
so
that
makes
sense
and
the
quick
rising
bubbles
help
to
bolster
the
head
giving
it
great
head
retention
the
aroma
displays
dark
skinned
fruits
and
spiciness
with
a
little
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
thrown
in
to
round
it
out
and
the
flavor
follows
suit
simply
adding
a
touch
of
grassy
and
perhaps
spicy
hops
to
the
background
the
fermentation
seems
clean
other
than
producing
the
brilliant
dark
fruitiness
and
some
spice
and
its
wellbalanced
by
a
moderate
to
median
bitterness
its
kind
of
hard
to
tell
with
the
carbonic
bite
of
the
co2
not
a
lot
of
brewers
are
producing
this
style
of
beer
right
now
and
certainly
not
to
this
quality
this
is
also
a
very
fresh
bottle
and
i
think
that
a
few
months
of
aging
might
soften
it
and
open
it
up
a
bit
to
reveal
a
greater
depth
of
maltiness
impressive
im
going
to
have
to
seek
out
more
offerings
from
this
brewery
this
is

to

nothing
to

a

anything

i
could
have
a

without

burnt
out

overall
the

was
surprisingly
quiet
but
this
was
exceptionally
balanced
and
i
felt
pushed
to
the
limits
if
this
beer
had
more
spice
if
it
had
more
malt
more
sweetness
more
carbonation
more
of
anything
it
would
have
felt
overdone
but
this
was
great
this
was
really
great
kind
of
a
dream
dubbel
for
me
ive
had
dubbels
from
belgium
and
trappists
that
have
nothing
on
this
a
great
interpretation
to
the
style
i
will
be
getting
this
again
in
the
future
without
even
a
second
thought
o
one
of
the
niced
dubbels
ive
ever
had
overall
this
would
rate
much
higher
if
it
wasnt
for
the
carbonation
issues
glad
its
local
so
i
can
keep
trying
overall
a
decent
dubbel
but
too
conservative
in
my
eyes
severly
low
in
depth
its
more
protuberant
quality
is
the
alcohol
play
the
carbonation
abv
and
residual
sugar
ratio
proves
effective
and
very
enjoyable
in
allowing
for
a
smooth
buzz
that
pervades
without
much
notice
was
quite
impressed
with
this
example
seems
to
stack
up
with
some
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
the
balance
and
complexity
of
this
are
solid
and
it
makes
a
very
drinkable
and
interesting
beer

quite
different
i
would
like
to
try
other
ales
from
this
brewery
good
beer
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
smallish
foamy
tan
head
that
soon
settles
to
a
selfreplenishing
island
and
ring
and
no

a

some
tiny

flavor
is
like

plus
sweet
up

followed
by
carbonic
tang
little

body
is
full
and
round
and
has
the
right
carbonation
to
cut
the
sweetness
finish
is
like
flavor
average
length
and
boozy
o
a
good
beer
to
pick
up
and
give
a
try
you
might
like
it
a
lot
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
overall
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
double
with
a
rich
complex
nottoosweetness
that
would
go
great
with
dessert
not
a
beer
style
i
personally
choose
very
often
but
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
this
particular
one
overall
another
quality
beer
from
this
brewer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
its
got
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
that
leaves
it
flavourful
but
not
cloying
not
sure
id
pick
it
up
again
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
m
medium
body
with
a
nice
chew
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
once
this
warmed
up
a
bit
i
was
quite
impressed
with
it
i
think
a
smaller
bottle
size
would
be
best
however
as
the
dryness
did
add
up
a
little
but
aside
from
that
i
think
this
is
the
dubbel
id
choose
from
this
point
on
an
excellent
dubbel
that
is
a
must
buy
when
it
comes
around
d
a
great
dubbel
with
a
different
tasting
flavor
while
this
wasnt
exactly
what
i
expected
its
still
a
great
beer
and
as
with
any
good
tasting
beer
with
a
high
abv
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
quickly
i
like
it
but
a
500ml
bottle
is
enough
for
me
o
very
nice
not
the
most
complex
or
outstanding
dubbel
ive
tried
but
overall
a
very
solid
entry
id
happily
drink
another
if
i
had
one
browninsh
ruby
colour
one
finger
of
off
whitetan
head
good
lacing
left
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
dark
sugars
and
dark
fruits
raisin
figs
black
liquorice
mild
yeasty
presence
slight
alc
taste
is
of
dark
fruit
with
sopme
candy
notes
brown
sugar
raisin
jammy
dark
fruit
in
the
finish
with
some
herbal
notes
black
liquorice
is
pretty
present
throughout
medium
carbonation
soft
feel
delicate
and
creamy
medfull
body
not
bad
but
this
failed
to
wow
me
like
some
of
the
other
stuff
from
these
guys
quite
drinkable
but
a
little
put
off
by
the
herbal
flavours
after
a
while
fairly
good
for
a
dubble
i
found
the
malt
profile
a
touch
darker
than
my
favorites
of
the
style
also
i
found
that
the
star
anise
flavor
was
a
bit
unwelcome
for
me
but
thats
a
personal
preference
allinall
complex
and
interesting
solid
dubbel
overall
a
solid
beer
and
fair
representation
of
the
style
wish
i
had
one
to
age
for
18
months
or
so
id
be
interested
to
see
how
this
ages
o
there
is
no
doubt
this
dubble
is
a
good
choice
i
would
drink
it
again
however
the
caramelized
notes
in
addition
to
the
very
syrupy
taste
affect
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
to
me
these
are
the
major
downfalls
i
might
try
having
it
colder
next
time
lots
of
dark
fruit
like
esters
were
bouncing
around
with
it
as
well
but
there
was
just
this
tremendously
big
earth
malt
aroma
coming
off
some
raisins
and
figs
were
playing
around
in
there
as
well
lots
of
spiced
rum
like
flavors
coming
at
me
at
first
then
the
malted
bread
like
tones
sitting
in
behind
it
a
very
thick
flavor
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
this
big
lots
of
raisins
figs
plums
and
a
touch
of
apricot
playing
around
in
there
letting
you
know
the
yeast
was
doing
its
thing
as
i
let
it
sit
and
started
to
take
bigger
sips
it
got
a
little
bit
lighter
for
me
but
still
retained
its
very
nice
profile
nice
dry
finish
o
its
a
very
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
really
easy
beer
for
8
5
charlevoix
still
remains
one
of
canadas
best
pleasant
spiced
belgian
alei
find
it
hard
to
really
consider
it
a
dubbel
a
style
with
which
it
shares
few
characteristics
but
it
has
the
body
of
a
belgian
and
the
light
drinkability
it
is
odd
though
overall
a
decent
but
not
great
dubbel
enjoyable
but
a
long
way
of
say
a
westmalle
or
an
ommegang
d
overall
a
very
solid
dubbel
a
fine
dubbel
with
a
nice
spicy
sweet
taste
certainly
worthy
of
recommendation
i
could
certainly
drink
a
lot
of
this
over
the
course
of
the
evening
though
the
abv
is
probably
going
to
prevent
that
not
the
greatest
dubbel
ive
had
but
certainly
an
enjoyable
one
d
quite
a
different
take
on
the
style
if
that
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
nothing
to
special
overall
feel
is
pretty
smooth
and
moist
slight
dark
fruit
aftertaste
this
is
quite
easy
to
drink
not
quite
as
good
as
some
dubbels
i
have
had
but
still
a
solid
beer
pours
a
deep
redmahogany
with
a
few
fingers
of
creamy
tan
head
sweet
nose
hints
of
green
apple
but
some
syrupy
dark
fruits
too
fresh
with
a
sense
of
acidity
but
at
the
same
time
im
smelling
something
that
reminds
me
of
banana
walnut
cake
intriguing
taste
is
walnuts
more
allspice
light
and
tart
green
apple
and
some
dark
fruits
to
a
lesser
extent
overall
beer
is
sweet
with
a
good
tart
balance
smooth
creamy
and
warming
and
somewhat
spicy
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
masked
medium
carbonation
and
a
sipper
for
the
most
part
alot
to
digest
with
this
one
but
another
nice
effort
from
charlevoix
dominus
vobiscum
double
strongly
reminds
me
of
one
of
my
favourite
belgian
ales
rochefort
8
to
even
mention
its
name
in
the
same
class
is
a
complement
most
flattering
to
its
brewer
while
i
can
imagine
the
strong
notes
of
clove
and
anise
might
overpower
some
im
sure
most
people
would
agree
that
this
is
a
rather
voluptuous
sensual
offering
dominus
vobiscum
latin
for
the
lord
be
with
you
double
could
be
a
very
good
spiced
belgianstyle
dubbel
too
bad
ill
probably
never
find
out
for
sure
especially
since
this
sort
of
beer
if
done
right
is
usually
right
up
my
belgian
ale
lovin
alley
d
cant
say
id
like
more
than
one
of
these
decent
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
had
by
a
long
shot
somewhat
heavy
as
well
explodes
with
a
five
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
traces
of
lace
cloudy
deep
mahogany
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
dark
fruit
nose

is
dark
fruit
cloves
with

dry

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
d
very
complex
flavours
with
a
very
strong
feel
i
dont
really
think
the
strong
carbonation
goes
with
these
flavours
but
it
works
well
enough
the
strong
alcohol
is
well
hidden
youll
be
glad
you
tried
this
nice
to
see
this
some
of
the
offerings
from
this
brewery
in
the
atlanta
area
its
imported
by
shelton
brothers
so
it
should
see
widespread
if
spotty
representation
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
chestnut
with
a
nice
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
cap
lots
of
spice
and
vanilla
in
the
nose
quite
sweet
and
quite
creamy
the
star
anise
is
very
noticeable
the
taste
is
still
fairly
sweet
but
not
nearly
so
much
as
the
nose
suggests
it
will
be
nice
creamy
malt
notes
some
belgian
yeast
tang
a
fairly
big
hit
of
star
anise
and
dried
dark
fruit
quite
tasty
and
probably
better
as
a
digestif
nice
d
at
9
this
is
a
one
bottle
per
night
beer
but
really
excellent
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
the
finish
was
smooth
clean
and
warming
leaving
me
wanting
more
much
more
this
was
excellent
i
was
enjoying
it
with
some
friends
and
i
could
not
stop
talking
about
how
perfect
it
was
i
dont
think
that
microbrasserie
charlevoixs
beers
are
available
outside
of
quebec
so
if
you
are
ever
there
make
sure
you
find
some
i
have
their
triple
waiting
for
me
in
the
fridge
m
d
not
quite
as
sparkling
as
some
but
a
very
assertive
carbonation
it
helps
the
retention
of
the
head
as
well
decent
sipper
some
alcohol
warmth
peeks
through
pours
a
rubybrown
colour
with
huge
head
great
lacing
and
head
retention
smell
is
of
dark
malt
and
licorice
quite
spicy
too
i
suppose
this
is
the
anise
this
tastes
almost
like
a
winter
warmer
mixed
with
a
dubbel
it
is
quite
interesting
great
carbonation
level
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
have
to
think
that
it
could
benefit
a
bit
if
the
anise
notes
were
toned
down
still
a
solid
effort
and
worth
a
shot
to
see
for
yourself
d
as
you
might
have
guessed
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
an
excellent
drinkable
beer
very
nice
example
from
a
brewery
ive
never
heard
of
until
now
glad
to
see
more
quebec
microbreweries
getting
distribution
in
vermont
seeing
how
close
both
places
are
this
is
really
good
there
are
lots
of
complexities
that
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
and
unique
dubbel
something
i
would
highly
recommend
dont
notice
the
black
licorice
as
much
much
better
head
retention
and
general
look
this
is
a
serious
beer
back
when
i
was
first
getting
into
beers
i
bought
charlevoixs
triple
thinking
that
since
it
was
one
more
than
double
it
must
be
better
was
that
ever
stupid
i
realized
recently
that
i
didnt
ever
go
back
to
try
the
double
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
500ml
dominus
vobiscum
releases
im
kicking
myself
for
not
having
tried
this
a
long
time
ago
this
is
one
of
the
top
regularlybottled
beers
in
the
country
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
drinkability
this
is
a
sipper
taste
last
long
a
lot
of
diffentent
taste
high
alcool
level
make
this
brew
very
interesting
for
a
nice
winter
drink
this
is
the
second
beer
from
charlevoix
ive
tried
and
im
thinking
i
need
too
try
more
of
what
they
offer
these
just
came
too
alberta
and
im
better
off
because
of
it
cant
wait
for
more
of
these
beers
to
hit
the
shelves
out
west
im
slowly
ploughing
my
way
through
the
charlevoix
lineup
and
its
been
a
great
experience
so
far
they
seem
to
be
a
consistently
strong
brewery
and
some
of
the
beers
have
a
wonderfully
fragrant
flavour
along
with
the
blanche
i
think
this
is
one
of
their
better
beers
a
spicier
citrus
twist
on
a
traditional
dubbel
that
works
wonderfully
thanks
rob
all
things
considered
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
8
5
abv
beer
one
bottle
a
night
would
be
about
as
much
as
you
could
handle
but
it
is
definitely
one
to
buy
more
of
i
had
to
let
this
one
settle
in
the
glass
and
warm
up
to
see
where
they
were
going
with
the
style
it
is
really
a
spiced
belgian
dubbel
that
almost
tastes
like
xmas
ale
think
unibroue
17
not
the
most
complex
beer
it
also
suffers
from
a
little
too
much
sweetness
cellaring
may
be
a
good
idea
the
beer
benefits
from
the
spices
as
without
it
would
be
an
average
belgian
style
ale
i
found
it
a
beer
that
one
glass
would
suffice
due
to
the
spice
and
the
sweetness
interesting
how
quebec
leads
the
way
in
canada
in
terms
of
making
some
gutsy
brews
this
one
falls
short
of
the
belgians
but
compared
to
what
big
rock
has
dared
and
tried
lately
would
need
to
revisit
this
one
later
i
would
guess
my
beer
experience
is
too
young
to
really
appreciate
this
type
of
beer
overall
an
okay
dubbel
but
if
i
had
to
nitpick
id
say
its
a
little
too
high
on
the
abv
and
a
little
overly
phenolic
for
my
tastes
a
wellrendered
double
deftly
balanced
the
alcohol
certainly
obfuscated
i
would
cite
this
as
a
purely
easydrinking
version
of
the
style
eventual
booze
and
ingress
challenges
aside
of
course
d
high
very
balanced
brew
easy
to
drink
with
only
the
abv
to
slow
you
down
drinkability
is
good
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
higher
than
i
expected
but
its
pretty
tasty

thought
the

have
been
more

body

above

its

overall
good

i
think
this
is
my
first
from
st
fuellien
and
beyond
tasty
enough
that
it
wont
be
my
last
hope
you
enjoy
as
much
as
i
do
and
will
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
again
when
i
see
this
at
my
local
beer
spot
salud
overall
quite
a
good
brune
but
i
would
still
prefer
a
kwak
on
balance
and
kwak
is
a
bit
more
affordable
too
deep
brown
color
some
cloudiness
and
a
very
thin
tan
head
sweet
light
esters
in
the
nose
rich
malt
flavor
but
some
slight
alcohol
burn
some
decent
bitterness
on
the
back
end
there
was
a
little
too
much
carbonation
but
as
the
beer
sat
it
seemed
to
settle
down
full
bodied
flavor
the
beer
coats
the
palate
and
leaves
a
lasting
flavor
again
there
is
some
alcohol
burn
but
it
does
not
take
away
from
the
flavor
o
a
very
good
example
of
the
belgian
dubbel
basically
a
spot
on
example
of
the
style
something
i
really
enjoy
well
done
and
highly
recommended
food
match
difficult
match
as
im
afraid
my
sample
may
have
been
spoiled
will
know
when
ive
reviewed
the
other
two
st
feuillien
brews
i
have
that
being
said
i
normally
approach
a
dubbel
as
complimentary
of
desserts
in
this
case
possibly
banoffee
pie
or
contrasting
to
a
sharp
matured
cheese
an
ok
dubbel
i
guess
o
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
i
like
my
dubbels
a
little
sweeter
with
more
depth
of
flavor
overall
a
decent
beer
although
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
feel
this
is
a
respectable
representation
though
overall
a
very
good
brune
this
was
only
the
second
time
i
had
tried
this
beer
but
it
does
not
lose
any
of
its
flare
the
second
time
around
a
good
buy
highly
recommended
for
any
situation
same
bottle
but
mine
says
8
5
and
it
pours
a
clear
kola
beer
hue
which
leaves
a
frothy
two
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
raisins
soaked
in
brandyxmas
pudding
and
nutmegthe
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
creamywell
carbonated
and
sweet
and
has
tastes
of
chocolate
coated
cherriesraisinsgingerbananna
bread
and
finished
with
a
sweet
belgian
yeasty
bread
flavour
and
basically
like
liquid
food
and
after
you
get
past
the
look
of
this
it
really
isnt
that
bad
but
theres
better
out
there
each
element
of
this
beer
is
interesting
and
maybe
good
the
problem
is
this
at
best
good
in
places
beer
doesnt
work
together
completely
dont
recommend
this
one
beyond
a
24
oz
sample
and
what
beer
isnt
worth
doing
that
with
o
overall
a
decent
dubbel
but
nothing
mind
blowing
o
not
too
complex
but
a
highly
enjoyable
brew
nonetheless
as
dubbels
go
this
one
ranks
among
the
sweetest
ive
had
theres
enough
brown
sugar
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
to
satisfy
any
sugar
addict
in
fact
one
might
be
able
to
substitute
this
for
the
requisite
brown
sugar
one
likes
to
plop
onto
ones
morning
oatmeal
if
one
were
so
inclined
of
course
signs
of
other
sweet
things
are
everywhere
such
as
sugar
and
sugar
some
mushroom
oddness
makes
a
brief
appearance
but
mercifully
is
pounded
back
by
the
sugar
worth
a
try
for
the
pretty
label
and
the
attractive
price
but
otherwise
this
is
not
something
to
brag
about
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
dubbel
the
abv
is
completely
concealed
about
as
sessionable
as
they
come
for
a
belgian
dark
brown
the
nose
is
malty
flavor
and
spices
the
palate
is
heady
offers
roasted
malt
but
blackberries
and
grapes
these
flavors
are
propagated
in
the
palate
with
light
touches
of
clove
we
find
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
a
classic
dubbel
but
fantasy
o
nice
blend
of
sweet
flavors
here
a
certain
complexity
about
it
not
overwhelming
in
any
way
but
a
solid
brune
another
nice
beer
from
these
guys
this
is
pretty
pedestrian
for
this
style
boring
bland
kind
of
simple
but
doesnt
make
me
desire
to
drink
it
this
was
a
solid
enough
dubbel
i
suppose
with
a
decent
complexity
and
a
good
drinkibility
to
it
i
just
wish
that
the
flavors
had
a
bit
more
richness
to
them
to
help
make
this
a
little
more
memorable
this
was
a
tasty
sipper
but
there
are
better
out
there
for
the
style
yeah
decent
and
balanced
palate
with
good
characters
enjoyable
beer
d
feels
rather
strong
for
a
double
but
still
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
complex
with
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
nice
double
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
i
paid
roughly
46
and
do
not
think
that
i
would
spend
that
much
on
this
again
pours
a
perfect
brown
with
a
slowly
dying
tan
head
that
left
a
lace
ring
around
glass
a
tart
cherry
smell
along
with
possible
other
dark
fruits
permeates
most
in
nose
as
there
is
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
a
lighttomedium
body
with
a
breadyyeastiness
so
the
beer
has
a
dryish
edge
some
minor
caramel
and
something
like
vanilla
gives
off
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
there
are
also
some
dark
fruit
flavors
a
dry
crisp
finish
thanks
to
lively
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
seems
a
tad
less
sweet
and
fruity
for
my
liking
more
of
a
dry
beer
in
any
case
if
you
like
dubbels
this
is
a
nice
one
jd
d
the
beer
isnt
very
difficult
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
the
beer
is
best
sipped
so
the
alcohol
wont
quickly
catch
up
to
you
this
is
a
marvelous
dubble
that
i
have
no
problem
grouping
in
with
chimay
red
and
ommegang
abbey
ale
paired
with
a
veggie
wrap
roma
tomatoes
fresh
basil
mozzarella
and
schrosphire
blue
cheeses
black
olives
and
pickled
black
peppercorn
this
beer
had
great
interplay
with
the
pepper
blue
cheese
and
olives
a
later
snack
with
sugar
cookies
bakes
with
cranberries
raisons
and
macadamia
nuts
were
also
a
pleasant
pairing
but
this
beer
is
also
a
great
desert
and
delicacy
all
on
its
own
from
the
25
fl
oz
corked
bottle
sampled
on
july
19
2010
it
pours
a
wellcarbonated
mahogany
brown
with
ruby
red
tints
and
about
a
half
inch
of
silky
tan
head
that
stays
around
not
a
lot
of
lacing
but
it
does
not
matter
to
me
the
aroma
emits
a
fine
balance
of
roasted
malts
clove
and
sweetness
that
is
not
unlike
brown
sugar
overall
this
is
a
mellow
and
very
drinkable
beer
in
the
tradition
of
belgian
abbey
ales
with
its
malty
flavor
and
noted
hop
finish
likeable
all
around
decent
easy
drinking
brew
only
negative
is
the
metal
finish
but
overall
a
nice
beer
drinkability
a
nice
dubbel
i
would
drink
again
if
available
d
heaps
of
flavour
and
recommended
d
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
but
not
so
typical
for
the
style
has
some
features
that
reminds
of
an
old
ale
with
lower
abv
delicious
and
similar
to
corsendonk
dark
abbey
ale
or
st
feuilliens
cuvee
de
noel
for
the
sweetness
no
8394
on
the
cork
the
beer
pours
a
murky
dark
amber
color
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
malts
the
flavor
is
dark
fruits
with
a
lot
of
caramel
malts
the
beer
is
very
dry
medium
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
in
a
way
it
reminds
me
of
this
brewerys
tripel
but
with
a
caramelish
character
seems
a
cross
of
dubbel
and
tripel
anyway
it
is
a
lovely
sipper
malty
and
spicy
with
that
classic
belgian
flair
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
d
i
started
out
with
this
beer
way
too
cold
after
giving
it
some
quality
time
to
warm
up
i
came
away
quite
impressed
the
flavor
is
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
dubbels
ive
had
d
very
nice
example
of
the
style
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
very
bubbly
although
fairly
thick
drinkability
surprisingly
good
a
fine
enjoyable
dubbel
that
served
as
a
pleasant
aperitif
at
leons
full
service
in
decatur
very
drinkable
soft
finish
and
toffee
aftertaste
barely
any
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
the
carbonation
holds
to
the
very
end
overall
really
representative
of
the
style
and
i
cant
find
anything
off
about
it
very
nice
brew
but
not
the
most
complex
ive
had
in
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
though
pours
a
very
fizzy
offwhite
head
quickly
diminishing
body
is
ruby
brown
in
color
very
cloudy
cant
see
through
very
fruity
aroma
some
dark
fruit
like
plum
and
fig
and
some
raisin
aroma
of
seedy
fruits
like
berries
a
little
effervescence
and
dustiness
fruity
taste
floral
light
floral
aftertaste
soft
carbonated
mouthfeel
a
little
sourness
letting
warm
up
a
bit
more
fruit
present
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
okay
tasting
some
spices
but
a
little
bland
overall
mouthfeel
is
alright
only
decent
carbonated
and
a
lightmedium
in
body
drinkability
is
amazing
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
bottles
of
this
i
kept
sipping
this
one
down
and
before
i
realized
it
i
had
finished
the
glass
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
its
nothing
special
worth
a
shot
d
not
the
best
dubbel
or
most
complex
or
fits
the
style
the
best
but
a
very
nice
beer
drinkable
beer
taste
is
spicy
with
light
roasted
notes
the
spices
add
an
almost
bitter
sensation
to
the
beer
there
is
a
certain
roasty
taste
to
this
beer
that
is
just
balancing
between
right
and
too
much
together
with
the
spices
which
add
a
citric
exotic
spicy
element
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
not
overly
sweet
and
not
too
thin
d
not
a
bad
brew
and
a
wonderful
wafting
aroma
i
might
not
be
too
quick
to
pick
it
up
a
second
time
but
its
certainly
worth
the
shot
and
it
does
have
some
very
pleasing
qualities
that
would
have
me
consider
it
again
d
not
as
impressed
as
i
hoped
to
be
the
one
note
wet
cardboard
that
i
find
in
some
belgian
belgianstyle
and
french
ales
is
present
in
this
beer
and
basically
ruins
it
for
me
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
poured
a
hazy
brown
with
a
very
nice
head
that
eventually
fades
to
a
thin
cap
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lacing
classic
dubbel
look
smells
fresh
and
minerally
lots
of
coriander
and
banana
and
some
light
malt
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
similar
rich
malt
with
a
clean
minerality
and
slightly
herbal
fairly
good
body
but
fairly
light
overall
and
quite
smooth
easy
drinking
and
delicious
much
better
on
tap
in
my
opinion
a
great
brown
beer
abbey
style
like
what
was
really
appreciate
in
belgium
in
the
early
80s
good
alcool
taste
nicely
bitter
toffee
taste
nice
brown
color
its
just
a
great
beer
as
its
really
drinkable
congratulation
to
the
brewers
its
a
perl
date
on
the
bottle
is
151208
just
past
the
freshness
date
pours
and
opaque
brown
with
a
large
tan
head
that
recedes
slowly
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
rich
aroma
of
dates
figs
cherries
and
candied
sugar
also
get
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
dark
fruit
also
plays
a
major
role
in
the
flavor
hints
of
cherries
alcohol
cleans
the
palate
on
the
finish
just
a
little
warming
from
the
alcohol
medium
body
but
a
touch
overcarbonated
a
little
harshness
on
the
tongue
i
am
not
big
into
dubbels
and
quads
but
i
liked
this
one
easy
drinking
with
the
alcohol
well
hiddened
drinkability
it
has
actually
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
a
belgian
and
this
beer
helps
me
remember
why
i
like
them
so
much
complex
yet
easy
drinking
bold
and
flavorful
yet
thirst
quenching
a
winter
sipping
drink
that
also
does
well
in
the
hot
summer
overall
a
very
nice
beer
d
this
was
a
pretty
easy
drinking
dubbel
i
can
imagine
this
best
fresh
the
appearance
of
this
beer
was
a
very
dark
brown
as
is
the
case
with
most
bruns
and
dubbels
it
was
served
in
a
tulip
glass
so
the
head
was
a
pretty
generous
offwhite
long
lasting
layer
of
froth
the
smell
was
bready
dry
a
little
boozy
yet
not
too
much
so
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
it
had
the
richness
and
depth
of
a
dubbel
but
lacked
that
malty
sweetness
which
i
sometimes
dislike
making
it
more
drinkable
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
pretty
heavy
with
an
ample
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
the
head
is
large
rocky
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
thick
lacing
which
lasts
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
cloves
ginger
and
anise
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
some
nice
butterscotch
notes
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
belgian
ale
pours
up

and

good
brew
my
wife
and
i
went
to
our
neighbors
house
for
dinner
my
neighbor
who
knows
absolutely
nothing
about
beer
bought
this
beer
for
me
because
he
thought
i
might
like
it
i
think
he
made
a
great
choice
the
beer
was
a
light
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
was
pretty
sticky
it
had
a
fruity
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
taste
was
also
sweet
and
fruity
yeasty
nicely
carbonated
i
wish
my
neighbor
had
bought
two
of
these
drinkability
this
is
light
and
delightful
for
a
belgian
but
full
of
flavor
instant
favorite
here

pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
from
a
brown
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
the
aroma
at
first
is
musty
this
doesnt
last
malty
aromas
dominate
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
improves
as
well
as
the
beer
warms
its
dominated
by
malt
the
hops
arent
especially
noticeable
but
do
a
nice
job
of
balancing
this
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
an
intriguing
dubbel
hazy
brown
with
a
light
tan
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
rich
with
dark
fruits
this
immediately
reminds
me
of
fruit
leather
grape
and
cherry
with
raisins
too
theres
subtle
spice
with
vanilla
and
cinnamon
in
the
background
but
theres
mostly
a
wonderful
fruit
taste
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
toffee
its
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
so
keep
this
for
dessert
a
great
beer
overall
had
this
one
at
belgo
centraal
in
london
it
is
clear
ruby
redbrown
with
no
real
head
the
smell
reminds
me
of
leather
flowers
nutmeg
and
various
spices
very
appetizing
the
taste
is
dry
floral
sharp
and
oaky
the
mouthfeel
is
downright
watery
the
drinkability
is
fine
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
its
balanced
refreshing
but
not
fantastic
not
a
bad
one
but
not
a
great
one
i
had
this
from
a
bottle
at
d
b
a
in
new
orleans
a
good
dubbel
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
very
well
composed
not
a
favorite
dubbel
i
would
not
make
any
plans
to
try
again
just
a
bit
boring

the
explosive
carbonation
coming
from

of

quickly
replenishes
the
head
with
a
layer
of
fine
bubbles
the
aroma
is
sweet

yeasty
and
the
flavor
adds
to
this
a
big

kick
of

biscuity

apples
melons
and
perhaps
some
phenols
on

of
a

that
imparts
a

overall
a

dubbel
that
makes

a

i
didnt

i
really
like
that
in

it

and
a
lack
of
that

that
seems
to
be
so
prevalent
in

styles
the
alcohol
while
detectable
was
very
inoffensive

mild
this
was
pretty

very

the

you
really
have

there

also

was
a

isnt

begin
with

this
brew
snap
crackle
popped
its
way
onto
a
short
list
of
sessionable
dubbels
but
no
reason
to
make

drinkability
would
have
been
higher
but
the

at
nearly
8
becomes
a
little
much
pours
a
clear

dark
mahogony
with
a
giant

the
head
lasts
and
leaves
great

the

a
large
amount
of

making

an

for
my
taste
this

is
alittle

luckily
it
doesnt

too
much
even
though
it
could
be
better
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
id
like
to
try
this
again
some
other
time
a
good
abbey
dubbel
poured
out
of
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
an
average
tan
head
that
left
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
musty
dark
fruit
not
very
strong
the
flavor
is
of
dark
fruit
carob
a
bit
of
hop
at
the
end
with
a
slight
metallic
taste
this
ale
is
a
bit
fizzy
with
a
moderate
body
overall
a
good
dubbel
not
too
sweet
which
makes
it
quite
drinkable
d
id
love
to
try
this
one
on
draft
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
bottled
version
of
this
and
i
bet
the
draft
version
could
only
be
better
ive
had
better
dubbels
and
ive
had
worse
this
one
is
well
worth
trying
as
it
has
a
lot
to
offer
very
nice
pours
a

is

with
various
hints
of

hops
and
fruit
crosing
the
palate
at
times
mediumbodied
and
quite
drinkable
i
refilled
a
few
times
on
this
one
nice
and
enjoyable
no
matter
what
i
said
this
is
a
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
while
there
are
other
dubbels
that
are
¬ìbetter¬î
there
really
isn¬ít
anything
wrong
with
this
one
i
think
my
bottle
is
a
few
year¬ís
old
i¬ím
not
sure
maybe
it
doesn¬ít
age
well
i
purchased
my
750ml
bottle
in
des
moines
ia
i
will
drink
this
again
worth
a
try
decent
beer
overall
but
ive
definitely
had
better
brunes
id
buy
it
again
but
only
if
all
of
the
other
brunes
were
unavailable
dark
redbrwon
color

a

head
that
left

taste
is
of

dark
fruit
and
toffee
a
little
different
but
not
bad
plenty
of
carbonation
and
full
bodied
decent
didnt
have
trouble
finishing
the
glass
but
there
are
other
examples
id
probably
rather
have
worth
a
try
this
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
pillowy
head
that
falls
into
a
little
head
with
a
lacing
thats
stuck
to
the
glass
color
is
dark
and
clear
amber
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
and
strong
with
very
flowery
hops
it
has
a
slight
sugar
candy
smell
to
it
and
it
also
has
a
nutty
flavor
to
it
taste
is
fairly
hoppy
with
many
flavors
like
a
big
nutty
flavor
it
has
a
slight
scent
of
banana
for
a
flavor
but
that
is
overpowered
by
so
many
other
flavors
golden
brown
color
too
oily
to
leave
much
for
lacing
the
aroma
is
heavy
belgian
yeast
spices
which
carries
over
well
into
the
taste
this
one
has
a
big
malt
presence
and
the
spices
compliment
that
pretty
well
while
this
is
not
one
of
those
knockyoursocksoff
belgians
its
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
id
like
to
try
this
ontap
as
bottles
from
belgium
seem
to
be
kinda
hitormiss
a
better
than
average
dubbel
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
out
a
bottle
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
could
wish
for
a
bit
more
complexity
but
it
certainly
is
right
about
where
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
i
am
quite
happy
to
be
working
my
way
through
a
750ml
bottle
this
evening
750
ml
bottle
purchased
at
total
wine
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
fluffy
2
finger
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
creamy
mass
not
leaving
much
lace
behindheavy
spice
and
yeast
in
the
aromassome
clove
and
cinnamon
mainly
with
a
touch
of
smoke
i
may
have
poured
a
little
to
chilledso
it
took
sometime
for
the
flavors
to
start
really
showing
thru
but
they
eventually
did
nice
vanilla
pod
and
clove
flavors
over
top
of
dark
fruit
and
light
smoke
a
nice
dubbel
here
dont
drink
to
chilled
and
the
flavors
will
come
out
nicelyquite
warming
the
cost
of
this
far
outweighed
the
taste
it
cost
me
about
8
for
a
single
bottle
now
i
have
no
problem
paying
a
fairly
large
amount
of
money
for
a
bottle
of
beer
but
usually
expensive
beers
actually
taste
good
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
enjoy
can¬ít
believe
that
there
are
only
two
reviews
for
this
brew
but
i
suggest
if
you
see
it
grab
it
and
give
it
a
try
it
is
worth
it
now
if
i
can
figure
out
how
to
get
a
good
shot
of
the
bottle
for
ba¬Ö
medium
bodied
lightly
nutty
malty
finish
but
the
fizz
is
too
harsh
for
my
taste
and
spoils
the
flavor
make
the
body
feel
thinner
than
it
should
be
have
to
admit
it
im
not
crazy
about
this
one
and
still
have
most
of
a
750
ml
bottle
to
go
wont
be
trying
this
one
again
although
my
opinion
of
their
other
beers
still
stand
nice

assume
it¬ís
a
function

crafted
brune
but
the
chocolatey
mintlike
flavor
really
got
to
me
after
a
while
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
wellcharged
a

thick
spongey

lightly
leaflike
with
some

light

and
highly
carbonated
for
a

flavor
is
tinged
with
a
bare
chocolate
lots
of
grape
and
bittered
with
an
initial
light
coffee
and
maybe
even
molasses
sense
overall
this
one
had
a
bit
of
trouble
generating
a
lot
of
flavor
for
me
finishing
like
it
starts
with
a
touch
of
a
phenolic
sense
and
never
really
spreading
out
in
malt
profile
a
little
bit
of
alcoholic
heat
not
really
one
of
my
favorites
per
style
more
of
a
niche
player
to
my
tastes
served
way
too
cold
had
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
to
taste
anything
nice
flavour
caramel
spice
citrus
rich
yet
nice
soft
mouthfeel
a
touch
sticky
but
nothing
to
really
complain
about
some
sweetness
at
the
start
but
in
no
way
cloying
well
rounded
and
feels
like
its
well
made
nice
brune
the
dark
fruits
really
come
out
in
the
flavor
as
do
chocolate
spice
and
just
a
wee
bit
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
also
present
in
the
warming
finish
bubbly
carbonated

to
a
dry

the

is

that
caresses
the

the

starts
malty
and
lightly
earthy
with
notes
of
light
chocolate
and
toffee
then
expresses
notes
of
dark
fruit
raisins
prunes
as
it
crosses
the
palate
and
ends
with
another
note
of
creamy
chocolate
the
finish
is
exceptional
long
and
dryish
with
a
wide
range
of
flavors
that
alternate
throughout
the
glass
sometimes
chocolatey
sometimes
fruity
and
always
with
some
light
spiciness
and
mild
lingering
malt
its
sweet
but
backed
by
enough
hop

to
keep
it
from
becoming
cloying
really
nicely

highly

overall
i
tend
to
put
trappist
beers
into
their
own
category
while
the
intent
is
to
brew
a
good
beer
its
not
the
primary
purpose
of
the
brewers
given
the
beers
are
a
byproduct
of
another
process
and
the
consumption
of
them
donates
not
to
crass
commercialism
but
to
worship
and
self
sacrifice
i
tend
to
enjoy
the
beers
more
than
just
because
of
their
flavor
if
this
was
just
another
beer
i
doubt
i
would
revisit
it
as
it
is
a
trappist
beer
ill
gladly
get
another
when
i
get
the
chance
nice
beer
one
that
i
would
have
again
happily
hazy
orange

with
a
small
head
that
fades
soon
leaving
a
non
compact

of
dark

medium

creamy
and

good
carbonation
taste

lemon
is
more
perceptible
good
but
not
near
the
best
trappist
beers
came
off
a
discount
shelf
seemed
a
bit
skunky
with
limited
secondary
flavors
rjt
i
wish
i
could
say
i
loved
this
being
born
in
austria
and
all
but
i
can
only
say
i
like
it
its
brewed
by
monks
and
out
of
austria
benno
is
a
solid
beer
as
it
stands
though
in
my
opinion
doesnt
quite
hit
the
lofty
expectations
of
set
by
other
trappists
o
this
beer
is
very
interesting
even
though
i
disagree
with
it
being
a
saison
im
not
sure
i
would
label
it
that
way
it
is
refreshing
to
a
certain
extent
it
has
a
lot
of
dubbel
characteristics
the
maltiness
yeastiness
lot
of
belgian
hints
and
the
spiciness
very
good
brew
4
i
really
like
tasting
this
beer
too
it
has
a
fuller
body
thats
light
on
its
feet
i
find
the
texture
to
be
really
silky
underneath
that
silk
are
some
wonderful
flavors
of
honeyed
cereal
toffee
caramel
grapefruit
stone
fruits
with
a
bitter
grassy
hop
ever
present
through
the
long
flavorful
finish
i
say
that
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
beer
for
your
smoked
gouda
you
found
your
beer
do
your
self
a
favor
and
enjoy
this
little
beauty
o
my
first
from
this
new
to
the
scene
trappist
beer
producing
brewery
ive
now
tried
brews
from
all
8
of
trappist
breweries
and
this
is
the
only
one
ive
not
travelled
to
a
year
ago
id
heard
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
try
beers
from
there
aside
from
actually
travelling
to
austria
to
try
it
i
was
so
glad
to
have
found
two
from
this
brewery
in
the
us
it
really
is
a
well
done
brew
it
is
listed
as
a
saison
and
yes
i
can
see
that
it
is
unique
and
has
some
belgian
triple

love
the

this
may
be
the
only
saving
grace
when
it
comes
to
this
recently
dubbed
trappist
ale
not
much
to
rave
about
here
given
the
status
of
a
brewery
like
this
would
never
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
fairly
boring
fairly
bland
other
standout
saisons
in
this
style
that
far
supersede
this
are

from
usual
trappist

styles
not
a
bad
beer
in
and
of
itself
but
certainly
my
least
favorite
of
the
trappist
ales
more
bitter
than
expected
the
yeast
esters
are
pleasant
as
is
the
pepper
and
clove
but
bitterness
lingers
more
than
i
prefer
o
modestly
enjoyable
but
highly
interesting
abv
mostly
hidden
in
the
nose
but
not
in
the
mouth
this
was
my
first
taste
of
an
engelszell
beer
it
falls
short
of
the
refreshing
grounded
nature
i
expect
from
a
saison
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
the
initial
pour
left
yeast
in
the
bottle
the
second
pour
included
yeast
which
cut
out
the
sharp
aromas
and
flavors
as
well
as
metallic
notes
yeast
definitely
improves
the
overall
profile
of
this
beer
hazy
light
brown
colored
beer
with
a
half
inch
of
tightly
woven
khaki
colored
head
brussels
lacing
i
get
the
aroma
of
light
earthy
malt
and
honey
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
earthy
malt
and
is
quickly
followed
by
a
candidate
sugar
like
kick
and
then
more
gently
sweet
malt
the
body
is
moderately
carbonated
and
fairly
dry
a
good
ale
but
not
indicative
of
quality
belgian
saisons
or
unique
interprrtations
of
such
still
a
worthwhile
effort
overall
a
nice
trappist
beer
and
different
from
the
other
ones
out
there
there
is
a
lot
of
bubblegum
in
this
one
but
it
really
seems
to
work
a
nice

that
is
worth
picking

you

id
classify
this
as

they
used

much
more
a

to
me
this
was
actually
pretty

well
give
it

again
doops
a
decent
enough
dark
saison
everything
displaying
an
air
of
subtle
complexity
and
the
dryness
is
more
than
palpable
something
different
for
a
trappist
brewery
to
put
out
that
isnt
some
form
of
a
maltforward
belgian
dark
ale
interesting
but
other
than
trying
a
new
monkbrewed
beer
this
one
doesnt
quite
have
me
reaching
for
another
o
this
one
is
very
rough
on
the
palate
calling
it
a
saison
is
a
bit
of
a
stretch
too
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
ive
never
had
a
saison
leave
a
sticky
syrupy
malt
coating
in
my
mouth
no
cohesion
at
all
easily
the
least
enjoyable
trappist
ale
ive
had
to
date
overall
a
really
nice
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
nothing
that
rocked
my
world
but
id
drink
this
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
a
wonderful
one
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
but
otherwise
you
can
probably
skip
it
o
good
drinkability
nice
saison
better
than
the
gregorius
one
poured

that
tastes
more
like
dry
earthy

than
hops
medium
bodied
with
peppery
carbonation
a
nice
example
of
a
belgian
style
farmhouse
ale
with
both
dry
saison
components
and
belgian
spicing
the
honey
element
is
not
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
may
contribute
to
the
fact
that
this
isnt
a
very
dry
ale
the
earthy
spicing
is
unusual
and
rewarding
this
is
a
complex
beer
that
fits
very
well
in
the
saison
category
rather
than
the
light
dubbel
as
it
was
labelled
for
some
time
i
cannot
stop
smelling
it
getting
waves
and
waves
of
different
aromas
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sour
which
makes
it
interesting
as
well
as
tasty
all
in
all
much
better
than
the
gregorius
and
in
its
sourness
unique
in
austria
i
am
very
excited
to
find
out
if
they
keep
the
sour
touch
or
mainstream
it
in
the
following
batches
o
a
delicious
saison
i
tried
the
gregorian
last
night
and
promised
to
review
both
im
a
sucker
for
saisons
and
this
one
is
top
notch
but
the
gregorian
is
more
unique
with
its
midnight
plumraisin
i
would
recommend
the
gregorian
over
this
one
although
both
are
great
overall
not
too
bad
but
on
the
lower
end
of
the
trappist
family
oi
am
glad
to
have
tried
this
brew
it
is
a
unique
a
tasty
drink
but
im
not
sure
it
qualifies
as
a
proper
saison
at
times
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
bdsa
with
the
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
honey
playing
against
the
clove
spices
anyway
although
it
is
tough
to
categorize
this
brew
is
good
and
i
would
happily
drink
it
again
a
good
early
fall
option
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
malty
and
with
some
nice
deep
spices
but
then
it
evolves
into
a
musty
lingering
finish
while
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
really
smells
and
taste
like
a
dank
dark
cellar
but
perhaps
thats
the
point
flavor
is
rich
and
thick
somewhat
noticable
grain
tone
definitely
honey
going
on
here
probably
a
little
too
hearty
in
that
it
could
use
its
edges
smoothed
out
not
too
shabby
a
drinker
could
use
the
wrinkles
ironed
out
for
sure
though
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
ale
d
this
was
a
decent
saison
with
nice
scent
and
taste
but
nothing
special
the
body
was
pretty
weak
and
the
finish
wasnt
the
smoothest
so
not
super
easy
to
drink
an
average
brew
and
really
not
impressive
for
a
trappist
overall
a
fairly
nice
blend
of
flavors
my
first
impression
was
not
great
as
its
grainyness
is
a
little
reminiscent
of
some
macro
beers
but
theres
more
going
on
and
its
better
than
my
initial
reaction
worth
a
try
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
spice
yeast
and
slight
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
spice
and
yeast
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
for
the
style
o
nice
clean
easy
going
saison
i
noticed
that
the
label
said
the
beer
is
brewed
with
honey
i
didnt
get
any
traditional
mead
flavors
but
its
probably
too
delicate
to
stand
up
to
the
more
roasted
flavors
in
the
beer
it
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
an
alright
dubbel
but
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
here
in
my
opinion
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
seems
to
taste
like
it
is
a
hybrid
of
a
saison
bi√®re
de
garde
and
a
dubbel
far
more
bitter
than
the
smell
would
indicate
starts
with
a
sour
and
nearly
dry
malt
up
front
the
swallow
is
nearly
astringent
with
a
bitter
kick
the
aftertaste
has
some
of
that
cherry
show
up
again
a
bit
flowery
but
it
leans
to
the
bitter
full
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
level
overall
this
is
good
new
entry
into
the
world
of
trappist
beers
sorta
a
saison
but
the
fuller
fruit
and
honey
notes
make
this
a
little
more
distinctive
o
a
nice
beer
not
mindblowing
in
any
way
but
highly
enjoyable
its
great
to
have
a
farmhouse
style
beer
in
the
trappist
stable
and
im
happy
to
welcome
our
newest
trappist
brewery
to
my
experience
base
benno
is
a
wonderfully
crafted
ale
that
compares
very
favorably
when
considered
in
the
likes
of
unibroue
maudite
and
de
koninck
ale
it
simply
belongs
in
the
portfolio
of
time
honored
trappistine
history
regal
spirit
and
taste
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
hazy
copper
with
a
fingerlength
white
head
and
lots
of
tiny
visible
bubbles
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
retains
well
throughout
consumption
the
beer
smells
like
lemon
belgian
yeast
funk
sweet
and
bready
malt
and
coriander
the
beer
has
a
nice
malt
profile
thats
evidenced
in
the
taste
being
nice
and
bready
with
some
sweetness
i
get
the
lemon
and
coriander
as
well
as
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
end
the
body
is
medium
with
lively
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
aftertaste
coats
the
mouth
this
is
a
nice
drinking
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
meh
pours
amber
with
golden
highlights
capped
by
a
fluffy
white
head
great
retention
and
plenty
of
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
plenty
of
yeast
on
the
nose
however
different
and
not
as
strong
as
the
the
saisonfarmhouse
yeast
found
in
most
saisons
the
honey
does
come
through
as
well
as
hay
and
some
malt
touched
by
a
bit
of
toffee
yeasty
caramel
honey
maltiness
a
light
touch
of
citrus
throughout
smooth
mouthfeel
light
medium
bodied
with
moderate
to
low
carbonationmuch
lower
than
most
saisons
ive
had
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
well
worth
a
try
o
benno
is
a
solidly
made
beer
in
spite
of
some
bumpy
areas
drinkable
big
proper
taste
with
an
approacable
abv
complexities
that
i
expect
from
a
trappist
ale
i
have
two
remaining
going
to
start
looking
for
more
gregorius
is
next
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
maybe
my
favorite
saison
that
ive
had
so
far
it
looks
fantastic
is
very
tasty
has
great
depth
of
flavor
and
has
a
tremendous
creamy
mouthfeel
awesome
beer
from
the
newest
trappist
brewery
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
beer
number
2
from
them
has
to
offer
overall
this
is
really
solid
and
wonderfully
balanced
also
its
also
very
unique
tasting
this
a
great
execution
for
a
trappist
beer
i
am
getting
more
from
these
guys
if
i
can
overall
interesting
tasty
and
well
worth
a
try
somewhere
between
an
orval
and
a
belgian
saison
in
terms
of
flavor
profile
certainly
good
enough
to
pick
up
again
best
blue
moon
beer
when
i
see
it
i
buy
it
the
best
bm
offering
by
far
this
is
a
ghastly
beer
very
good
but
not
favorite
of
all
time
personally
dont
understand
the
bad
reviews
yes
its
produced
by
coors
but
i
dont
hold
that
against
it
nice
smell
nice
colour
great
taste
my
favourite
production
from
the
blue
moon
family
overall
hard
not
to
compare
this
to
the
standard
blue
moon
belgian
white
it
is
similar
but
more
spice
and
less
citrus
a
little
more
roast
something
is
missing
from
the
flavor
not
sure
what
overall
it
is
not
offensive
but
it
is
hard
to
get
excited
about
fairly
light
bodied
or
at
least
in
the
feel
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
not
what
i
expected
from
blue
moon
il
stick
with
the
regular
blue
moon
better
than
expected
but
did
not
expect
much
nice
brown
type
ale
not
too
spiced
smooth
nice
mellow
beer
that
will
not
seek
out
but
would
accept
if
offered
overall
this
beer
is
a
pass
too
sweet
for
my
palate
and
it
lacks
spice
and
depth
of
flavor
this
poured
a
nice
coppery
orange
the
nose
was
malty
along
with
a
brown
sugar
syrupy
smell
no
hops
to
be
found
the
taste
however
was
very
thin
i
was
expecting
some
of
that
malty
sweetness
to
come
through
but
it
ended
very
quickly
i
thought
the
mouth
feel
was
a
bit
too
bubbly
almost
soft
drink
fizz
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
it
was
however
average
beer
is
an
average
season
beer
not
my
favorite
for
a
double
its
pretty
thin
tasting
acidic
alcohol
finish
no
real
carmel
or
accompanying
notes
kind
of
disappointed
really
i
was
hoping
for
more
spice
and
flavor
solid
beer
my
go
to
winter
beer
besides
shiner
cheer
love
the
sugary
taste
its
simple
but
i
enjoy
it
no
real
complaints
its
winter
warmth
and
very
drinkable
i
am
just
struggling
to
taste
much
in
this
brew
that
said
loved
the
pumpkin
a
couple
months
ago
has
a
bit
of
the
taste
of
the
pumpkin
a
decent
beer
honestly
its
not
the
best
beer
out
there
but
i
like
it
its
great
for
the
cold
season
if
this
is
on
the
shelves
at
a
local
jewel
ill
buy
it
this
was
a
pleasant
dubbel
with
a
nice
balance
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavors
o
while
i
definitely
would
not
call
this
a
winter
abbey
ale
i
would
call
this
a
winter
ale
it
has
the
characteristic
spiciness
of
the
american
style
winter
ale
its
nice
and
spicy
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
typically
i
find
orange
in
the
mix
in
belgian
christmas
ales
recommended
worth
a
try
and
definitely
underrated
maybe
ill
have
a
coke
average
in
the
glass
it
is
a
clearish
dark
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
settles
quickly
and
laces
a
bit
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
in
the
smell
the
background
may
also
hold
some
belgian
yeast
character
as
well
but
if
anything
it
is
weak
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
caramel
as
well
its
a
bit
slick
with
maybe
a
touch
of
metallic
twang
in
there
as
well
really
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
as
this
beer
is
sweet
all
the
way
through
with
a
slightly
sticky
finish
that
really
doesnt
do
much
to
invite
the
next
sip
the
body
is
heavier
than
i
would
have
expected
but
the
weird
flavor
combinations
and
finish
prevent
a
higher
score
in
this
category
overall
this
isnt
very
good
i
see
how
this
may
appeal
to
hardcore
blue
moon
fans
but
ill
leave
it
for
them
d
a
so
so
at
best
beer
the
appearance
and
aroma
led
me
to
think
this
one
may
have
a
chance
of
surprising
but
the
flavor
profile
turns
a
bit
messy
a
few
minor
tweaks
could
go
a
long
way
not
terrible
but
in
its
current
form
it
is
not
anything
i
would
recommend
nor
revisit
damn
marketing
people
i
have
to
confess
that
the
label
sold
me
it
was
the
cozy
snowy
winter
cabin
but
its
basically
a
coors
banquet
beer
with
some
specialty
malts
added
ok
that
might
be
harsh
but
i
definitely
taste
the
coors
in
it
one
of
those
beers
that
you
buy
on
a
impulse
just
to
try
it
cause
it
is
on
sale
even
though
you
know
its
not
really
craft
beer
drink
the
6
pack
say
that
was
decent

5very
drinkable
o
could
be
an
excellent
beer
but
something
is
missing
excellent
ingredients
but
not
a
perfect
balanced
beer
if
im
generous
this
is
mediumbodied
effervescence
is
light
this
drinks
much
more
light
a
dark
lager
than
anything
else
its
not
an
offensive
beer
to
drink
but
not
one
i
would
ever
seek
out
again
overall
i
think
just
gets
a
bad
rep
cause
coors
is
so
heavily
associated
with
blue
moon
and
we
all
know
they
cant
make
beer
for
the
life
of
them
but
blue
moon
has
really
surprised
me
with
this
beer
and
their
pumpkin
seasonal
didnt
like
pale
moon
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
seasonal
beer
to
bring
to
a
party
or
sit
at
home
and
have
a
few
this
is
worth
trying
its
just
as
good
if
not
better
than
some
of
the
microbrewed
winter
seasonals
ive
had
so
far
and
i
work
at
a
liquor
store
so
ive
tried
all
the
ones
we
got
in
so
far
will
buy
again
for
the
right
occasion
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
reddish
brown
color
the
head
was
white
and
faded
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
very
light
belgian
aromas
but
nothing
too
true
to
the
real
belgian
dubbels
the
taste
is
very
weak
compared
to
most
real
dubbels
the
beer
has
some
sweet
flavors
with
some
earthy
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
too
light
for
a
winter
brew
overall
not
too
much
to
really
say
i
wasnt
really
impressed
on
this
brew
a
dryish
aftertaste
on
this
medium
bodied
beer
seems
to
be
the
highlight
of
this
beer
although
this
winter
abbey
has
some
spices
malt
and
fruits
coming
through
in
the
taste
they
seem
to
miss
the
point
or
not
fulfill
its
potential
o
in
all
fairness
to
the
beer
it
isnt
terrible
it
is
however
distinctly
not
a
dubbel
reminiscent
of
a
dubbel
related
to
a
dubbel
nor
does
it
have
any
other
connection
to
a
dubbel
so
as
a
dubbel
it
fails
miserably
in
all
categories
except
smell
as
a
beer
however
its
drinkable
but
still
not
very
good
overall
way
better
than
macros
but
not
really
good
i
wont
seek
this
out
again
soon
apparently
the
label
claims
it
has
a
toffee
finish
well
that
didnt
happen
amber
hue
into
my
chalice
minimal
head
little
retention
scent
is
clean
up
front
if
not
outright
dull
taste
is
a
blast
of
sweetness
with
dark
fruit
on
the
edges
a
bit
watery
but
sits
heavy
in
my
stomach
alchohol
is
rough
around
the
edges
even
with
the
lower
abv
this
is
by
no
means
a
more
seesion
able
belgian
style
blah
smells
mainly
of
malty
toasted
grains
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
and
fruit
at
the
edges
fruity
malts
are
the
first
flavors
to
come
across
on
the
tongue
blossoming
in
fruit
esters
such
as
orange
and
apricot
these
esters
are
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
tang
of
the
dark
belgian
sugar
mentioned
on
the
label
which
adds
a
nice
caramel
layer
to
the
fruit
light
vanillas
and
toffees
may
also
be
found
here
the
hops
dont
seem
to
really
kick
in
for
me
which
is
surprising
since
the
original
label
description
said
that
there
were
multiple
hops
present
either
the
recipe
has
changed
or
the
hops
are
simply
too
weak
to
be
immediately
noticeable
and
instead
constitute
a
slight
background
fuzz
for
me
the
ales
weakest
point
comes
near
the
end
all
of
the
fruity
caramel
flavors
fade
away
leaving
only
a
stale
beer
taste
on
the
back
of
my
throat
if
i
had
to
rate
only
the
first
half
of
the
mouthful
i
would
have
given
it
at
least
a
fourbut
the
aftertaste
is
only
a
one
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
shade
of
red
smells
of
malt
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
pretty
good
with
some
nice
malt
flavor
and
a
little
bit
of
sweet
brown
sugar
the
ending
is
very
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
it
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
quite
enjoyable
on
a
cold
night
overall
ill
admit
i
didnt
think
i
would
like
this
one
and
was
secretely
hoping
i
wouldnt
but
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
see
is
more
body
and
perhaps
a
bigger
overall
beer
i
would
drink
this
anytime
it
was
handed
to
me
still
prefer
the
traditional
blue
moon
belgian
white
to
any
of
their
seasonal
beers
i
have
tried
thus
far
for
being
a
coors
brew
this
beer
has
an
impressive
level
of
flavor
although
caramel
and
malt
dominate
most
of
the
taste
its
still
more
flavor
than
what
you
normally
find
from
similar
breweries
overall
i
was
happy
that
i
tried
it
but
will
not
be
counting
the
days
until
next
winter
to
try
it
again
d
this
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
great
either
i
would
pick
it
up
before
a
domestic
lager
any
day
i
would
say
its
a
hair
better
than
regular
blue
moon
but
thats
not
really
a
compliment
some
resemblance
to
a
killians
irish
red
which
stuck
me
as
odd
for
a
moment
before
i
realized
they
are
made
by
the
same
parent
company
in
any
case
this
is
not
a
dubbel
as
currently
classified
on
ba
its
more
of
a
red
ale
mixed
with
a
light
witbier
summary
this
is
a
below
average
beer
i
gave
it
6
810
or
d
this
beer
is
strange
to
me
it
looks
very
nice
smells
nice
but
tastes
like
something
im
not
familiar
with
maybe
like
a
light
ale
this
is
the
first
dubbel
ive
drank
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
the
taste
is
really
quite
bland
nothing
stands
out
here
that
could
be
how
its
supposed
to
taste
though
im
not
sure
im
really
impressed
with
the
head
and
retention
but
not
much
else
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
drink
often
drinkability
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
went
well
with
some
costa
rican
food
especially
a
rice
and
beans
dish
it
pours
a
dark
redbrown
color
when
held
up
to
light
it
is
transparent
head
quickly
recedes
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
with
a
slight
film
on
top
of
the
beer
smell
isnt
really
there
but
what
i
can
faintly
smell
is
alcohol
and
maple
syrup
so
far
unimpressive
taste
no
longer
is
repulsive
to
me
but
it
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
it
tastes
watery
there
is
a
slight
malty
sweetness
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
taste
gross
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
expected
for
a
winter
beer
overall
this
really
isnt
an
improvement
from
the
first
time
i
tried
it
overall
an
okay
beer
a
poor
mans
version
of
a
dubbel
its
as
though
it
was
watered
down
at
bottling
still
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
a
bmc
company
i
thought
the
brew
wasnt
bad
with
the
first
pint
but
the
taste
really
got
annoying
on
the
second
pint
i
noticed
the
weak
flavors
it
seemed
like
it
just
wasnt
mixing
well
i
think
if
the
flavors
were
a
little
more
in
your
face
this
would
be
a
great
beer
overalllacks
the
overall
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
a
good
dubbel
abbey
ale
probably
the
worst
abbey
ale
that
ive
had
ok
overall
given
the
price
this
beer
could
be
improved
this
is
a
fair
beer
the
lack
of
flavor
is
the
downside
to
what
could
be
good

really

i
wouldnt

a

more
of
these
great
winter
ale
overall
overall
pretty
good
tried
it
for
the
first
the
last
week
during
the
packers
game
didnt
like
it
at
first
but
i
kinda
grew
on
me
d
easy
to
drink
pretty
good
not
amazing
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
a
little
too
fullbodied
for
what
you
get
here
it
coats
the
whole
mouth
and
throat
on
the
way
down
which
is
not
really
what
a
simple
brew
like
this
should
do
its
fairly
drinkable
though
probably
due
to
the
fairly
low
abv
the
sweetness
can
be
grating
though
this
winter
seasonal
is
completely
average
nothing
to
really
make
it
stand
out
besides
the
extremely
inviting
appearance
nothing
to
love
here
d
smooth
goes
down
nicely
nothing
over
powering
or
overly
impressive
just
easy
to
drink
i
definately
could
have
a
few
of
these
overall
nah
i
will
pass
on
this
one
they
need
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
here
tastes
more
like
a
standard
winter
ale
as
expected
this
poser
coors
beer
does
not
live
up
to
the
abbey
dubbel
style
indicated
on
the
label
drinkability
a
middleoftheroad
beer
qualitywise
i
wouldnt
make
this
a
common
addition
to
my
beer
calendar
but
one
once
in
awhile
aint
bad
overall
a
rather
bland
dubbel
but
might
serve
as
a
very
basic
intro
to
belgian
brews
spiced
and
toffee
not
a
bad
combination
for
playin
dominos
in
the
winter
drinkability
easily
accessible
but
also
somewhat
restrained
it
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
but
there
are
abbey
style
ales
from
belgium
that
taste
exactly
like
this
and
there
are
some
that
are
even
lighter
so
its
actually
hard
to
fault
its
a
really
nice
easy
drinking
beer
its
tasty
and
charming
one
note
allow
it
to
warm
a
bit
to
display
its
full
range
of
flavor
d
as
for
the
drinkability
of
this
one
there
is
no
harsh
characteristics
that
tend
to
be
undrinkable
there
also
is
nothing
very
note
worthy
of
it
either
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
by
a
major
bmc
beer
ultimately
forgettable
and
disappointing
not
worth
going
out
and
getting
d
its
a
drinkable
beer
not
one
that
i
would
not
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
but
to
be
honest
i
would
rather
choose
another
beer
to
drink
more
often
than
this
one
brownish
or
perhaps
amber
color
with
a
head
of
about
a
finger
recedes
fairly
quickly
not
too
much
in
the
aroma
a
fairly
clean
smell
overall
some
sweetness
immediately
as
well
as
some
bitterness
at
the
end
maltiness
is
present
as
well
holding
the
beer
together
in
a
way
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
smoothness
to
it
overall
not
bad
at
all
but
probably
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
when
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
glass
it
had
a
nice
2
white
head
that
sat
on
top
of
a
nice
dark
brown
body
the
aroma
is
not
much
but
a
little
maltiness
the
taste
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
caramel
and
toffee
taste
this
beer
is
nice
and
smooth
not
much
else
to
talk
about
here
other
then
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
i
think
it
is
drinkable
picked
up
a
single
at
the
grocery
store
it
pours
out
a
nice
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
slight
quickly
fading
head
the
nose
is
very
bland
with
just
a
faint
maltiness
the
flavor
well
theres
absolutely
zero
belgian
yeast
character
instead
its
mostly
sweet
caramel
a
touch
of
toffee
little
else
if
it
had
a
little
more
bitterness
itd
make
a
nice
competitor
to
fat
tire
but
its
not
a
belgianstyle
beer
by
any
means
this
one
wasnt
too
bad
its
nice
but
nothing
special
its
a
dark
brown
with
fairly
low
carbonation
the
aroma
was
weak
producing
a
tine
amount
of
malty
spices
taste
was
decent
the
spices
and
a
touch
of
plumb
and
caramel
had
to
be
hunted
down
to
be
noticed
its
very
smooth
not
an
excessive
amount
of
character
here
but
its
nothing
to
turn
away
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
bit
thin
and
spritzy
in
the
swallow
pours
a
tawny
color
with
light
fan
head
looks
good
but
the
love
ends
there
nose
is
light
to
nonexistent
with
some
faint
caramel
artificiallike
caramel
toffee
candy
on
the
palate
through
to
the
finish
almost
sickly
nutty
aftertaste
too
with
heaps
of
that
god
awful
caramel
fail
verdict
im
thinking
that
the
potential
of
this
beer
has
been
overshadowed
by
the
malts
and
wheat
flavor
it
isnt
bad
tasting
but
needs
much
more
than
what
its
giving
to
carry
my
interest
it
isnt
too
sweet
but
due
to
there
not
being
much
else
here
it
might
be
hard
to
tell
otherwise
prepare
to
share
a
six
pack
with
a
friend
should
you
not
enjoy
this
brew

may
be
likely

a

being

it

my

its
actually
a
pretty
good

with
aromas
of

and

at
some
bars
this
is
the
best
choice
drinkability
its
no
dubbel
thats
for
damn
sure
but
i
guess
you
gotta
shove
it
somewhere
however
it
did
pair
well
with
the
flick
its
a
mad
mad
mad
mad
world
it
does
have
that
going
for
it
draught
this
one
poured
a
somewhat
reddishbrown
color
it
was
also
fairly
clear
unfortunately
it
was
poured
into
a
heavily
frozenfrosted
mug
so
i
cant
judge
or
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
bit
light
some
sweet
malts
and
spices
the
taste
was
a
little
light
it
was
a
little
tasty
and
certainly
not
offensive
to
anyone
some
sweet
caramel
malt
and
spices
not
bad
but
it
is
a
dumbdowned
dubbel
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
but
for
the
price
its
nothing
special
might
get
it
again
but
not
in
the
near
future
poured
a
weird
orange
colorwith
no
head
nose
smells
rather
weak
lightly
flavored
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
an
interesting
spicing
on
the
finish
the
body
is
very
thin
and
weak
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
some
malts
and
hops
and
a
tad
bit
of
caramel
bad
excuse
for
a
warmer
not
bad
reminds
me
of
a
watered
down
dubbel
pretty
sessionable
dubbels
are
not
really
my
gig
but
this
one
is
not
a
horrible
stab
at
the
style
by
an
american
macro
sad
to
see
this
guy
retire
a
nice
offering
from
blue
moon
and
formerly
available
even
where
most
other
offerings
were
quite
frightening
a
nice
dark
honey
pour
with
light
beige
head
that
clung
nicely
to
the
glass
dissipating
from
a
1
finger
width
a
nice
basic
spicedorange
nut
malt
aroma
that
opened
to
include
a
lemonhop
zesty
flavor
upon
tasting
a
good
decent
christmastime
ale
that
only
made
coors
wee
division
a
little
bit
better
drinkability
is
very
poor
im
debating
of
even
finishing
this
one
ultimately
a
beer
that
could
be
very
good
but
seems
like
it
is
just
too
weak
its
like
the
taste
was
siphoned
out
of
it
i
wont
be
having
another
this
year
but
i
might
revisit
it
next
winter
to
see
if
there
is
any
improvement
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
an
average
foam
head
that
stays
a
very
short
while
it
dies
quick
and
retains
no
lacing
its
weak
on
flavor
but
its
a
bit
better
than
i
antisipated
from
coors
a
very
mild
hop
bitterness
with
a
little
bit
of
spices
in
it
it
has
weak
mouth
feel
and
not
enoigh
carbonation
for
my
taste
no
real
high
class
body
this
ale
is
nothing
to
rave
about
ddecently
drinkable
not
a
spectacular
beer
not
overly
complex
especially
considering
the
style
but
still
an
enjoyable
drink
id
drink
it
again
in
the
future
though
i
wont
be
searching
for
it
sorry
i
do
not
recommend
this
is
an
atrocious
example
of
a
belgian
beer
i
feel
bad
having
enjoyed
previous
offerings
from
this
company
it
wont
in
any
way
influence
my
decision
to
have
another
beer
from
blue
moon
but
i
wouldnt
touch
this
one
again
even
if
you
threatened
to
make
me
listen
to
you
strangling
my
first
born
to
death
very
drinkable
not
to
bad
but
also
probably
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
it
was
worth
a
try
though
and
i
could
see
some
people
really
liking
this
a
lot
depending
on
your
taste
drinkability
would
be
through
the
roof
if
this
tastedhad
any
tastebetter
ok
so
this
is
about
what
i
expected
appearance
is
meh
straw
yellow
no
real
head
or
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
quite
similar
very
clean
tasting
a
touch
of
hops
and
barley
any
malt
taste
mouth
feel
is
too
weak
even
for
a
belgian
pale
drinkability
is
good
but
only
because
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
weak
i
cant
say
id
return
to
this
one
again
any
time
soon
but
points
for
the
effort
at
least
the
blue
moon
line
is
trying
something
new
to
appeal
to
the
masses
that
is
after
all
who
theyre
after
much
more
than
the
beer
geeks
who
might
have
issues
with
this
beer
posing
as
a
style
it
just
doesnt
match
d
i
like
this
a
lot
i
know
the
reveiws
arent
as
good
as
this
overall
but
i
like
it
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
little
overcarbonated
certainly
an
option
for
those
nights
when
you
have
some
leftover
after
your
parents
are
in
town
and
you
just
want
something
nice
and
light
me
by
the
way
i
cant
say
i
would
seek
this
out
but
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
if
given
an
opportunity
and
nothing
better
is
available
drinkability
not
wretched
but
not
great
ill
probably
not
buy
it
again
but
if
a
friend
offered
me
one
id
drink
it
d
can
probably
only
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
little
too
bitter
for
it
to
be
a
session
beer
drinkability
not
a
favorite
of
mine
nor
a
beer
that
i
would
actively
seek
out
it
is
easy
drinking
but
doesnt
have
the
complexity
nor
body
i
am
looking
for
in
a
winter
ale
of
the
twelve
this
will
probably
be
my
only
sample
the
rest
will
be
drank
by
my
girlfriend
or
at
a
party
drinkability
was
good
if
you
like
sweet
beers
tastes
like
many
of
the
winter
warmers
i
have
had
this
year
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
slightly
roasty
leaves
much
to
be
desired
d
not
too
bad
especially
for
coors
id
drink
it
if
i
was
in
macroville
drinkability
this
was
easy
to
drink
but
overall
there
was
no
wow
factor
not
recommended
i
liked
this
a
lot
the
first
time
i
tried
it
so
i
bought
a
couple
more
its
taste
isnt
different
from
when
i
first
had
it
i
dont
know
why
i
liked
it
so
much
its
not
bad
and
i
can
certainly
have
more
than
one
but
its
not
complex
enough
goes
down
way
too
well
with
very
little
flavor
worth
a
try
but
not
stellar
i
think
i
rated
this
fair
for
what
it
is
food
was
most
excellent
compliment
with
hearty
sweet
garlic
spaghetti
strikes
me
as
a
strange
mix
between
an
abbey
ale
and
a
blue
moonhuh
maybe
thats
cause
it
is
crazy
stuff
ok
ok
it
isnt
a
trappist
brew
and
it
would
shudder
in
the
presence
of
a
westmalle
or
a
rochefort
but
it
kicks
the
hell
out
of
blue
moon
that
being
said
there
are
much
better
ways
to
spend
your
hard
earned
cash
d
another
alright
blue
moon
seasonal
it
is
drinkable
and
just
slightly
more
alcohol
than
blue
moon
however
id
stick
to
other
beers
over
this
d
other
then
not
being
to
style
but
very
roughly
to
style
1
grain
sand
paper
rough
this
does
drink
well
for
a
beer
d
this
is
a
good
beer
to
share
with
friends
and
family
that
are
accustomed
to
drinking
macro
brews
the
mild
flavor
makes
it
easy
to
drink
a
few
but
dont
expect
a
lot
of
complexity
d
pretty
high
but
not
much
flavor
kind
of
falls
in
to
the
fat
tire
sam
adams
category
for
me
more
of
the
micro
impersonation
you
would
expect
i
grabbed
one
out
of
the
cooler
and
figured
why
not
try
it
not
horrific
but
not
great
pass
taste
like
a
brown
ale
with
a
sorta
brown
sugar
taste
not
bad
but
its
kinda
boring
and
not
very
complex
notes
fair
offering
from
coors
more
interesting
than
the
pale
moon
but
not
as
good
as
blue
moon
d
unlike
bmwheatsbeers
i
cant
drink
these
very
fast
or
do
more
than
two
of
them
too
sweet
or
something
else
just
not
as
pleasant
a
brew
still
not
bad
i
just
was
expecting
better
d
fairly
average
drinkability
the
presentation
is
mellow
and
uneventful
much
like
a
cheap
beer
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
macro
twang
corn
malt
brown
sugar
and
a
tiny
bit
of
toast
the
appearance
is
light
brown
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
the
aftertaste
is
cloying
yet
astringent
overall
i
dont
care
much
for
this
one
decent
is
the
best
way
to
sum
up
this
beer
good
balance
but
low
on
firepower
i
can
stomach
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
as
i
feel
the
need
to
try
almost
every
beer
i
see
but
i
wont
be
picking
this
beer
up
until
next
year
when
ive
forgotten
what
it
tastes
like
d
this
goes
down
easy
but
mainly
because
it
has
no
character
too
many
better
belgian
ales
out
there
full
moon
winter
ale
pours
a
dark
reddish
copper
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
mild
a
bit
malty
the
flavor
is
very
mild
sweet
and
malty
pleasant
enough
but
not
the
least
bit
challenging
better
than
a
standard
macro
lager
would
not
recommend
or
purchase
again
overall
average
dark
beer
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
was
not
expecting
that
from
this
beer
for
some
reason
i
expect
more
since
blue
moon
is
a
decent
beer
and
they
seem
to
try
but
just
cannot
seem
to
get
any
of
the
other
seasonals

it
is
nice
to
see
such
a
large
brewer
buck
the
norm
and
go
for
a
less
mainstream
style
mouthfeel
is
also
a
tad
weak
a
little
too
watery
good
carbonation
though
overall
ive
enjoyed
the
seasonals
from
blue
moon
and
this
is
no
exception
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
id
call
this
abbey
ale
light
they
need
to
put
more
of
everything
into
this
beer
d
its
not
bad
by
any
means
some
nice
flavors
are
present
just
in
a
waterymoderate
fashion
its
very
drinkable
and
certainly
sessionable
which
is
probably
what
they
were
aiming
for
you
could
do
worse
but
its
nothing
to
rave
about
drinkability
heavy
at
first
but
as
i
worked
my
way
down
the
glass
i
did
not
feel
the
same
way
between
1
and
3
is
how
much
i
would
probably
be
willing
to
drink
in
a
row
pours
a
hearty
looking
dark
black
and
has
a
sweet
smell
to
it
overall
flavor
is
a
bit
subdued
but
still
has
some
of
the
belgian
sugars
being
noticeable
and
the
mouthfeel
and
body
are
excellent
could
use
a
tad
more
in
the
actual
taste
department
but
this
beer
was
super
easy
to
drink
and
went
down
smooth
a
nice
winter
seasonal
not
a
bad
beer
overall
and
worth
the
purchase
it
was
a
bit
light
overall
for
this
style
but
a
good
beer
to
introduce
others
to
other
tastes
out
there
d
an
ok
brew
but
like
most
of
blue
moons
seasonals
it
falls
short
not
bad
but
entirely
forgettable
mouthfells
suprise
suprise
is
thin
as
hell
too
its
a
decent
tasting
session
beer
but
its
no
abbey
ale
drinkability
pretty
easy
to
session
but
the
taste
wouldnt
make
that
possible
alot
of
these
socalled
winters
should
just
be
left
untouched
because
years
ago
i
can
remember
this
beer
actually
being
pretty
quaffable
not
anymore
besides
the
appearance
this
beer
is
pretty
forgettable
coors
needs
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
fix
the
blandness
and
the
horrid
grassy
smell
this
beer
emits
pours
a
solid
brown
color
with
amber
highlights
at
the
edges
tight
offwhite
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
roasted
malt
and
sweet
candi
sugar
the
taste
is
of
light
roasted
malt
grainy
enough
dark
candi
sugar
to
balance
out
the
grainy
flavor
definitely
a
bda
in
2008
it
appears
that
they
may
have
changed
the
style
over
last
year
according
to
the
reviews
the
feel
is
moderate
with
prickly
carbonation
quite
balance
perhaps
tipping
towards
the
sweet
end
not
a
terrible
abbey
ale
has
some
roasted
flavor
and
sweetness
but
lacks
the
belgian
yeast
spice
easily
drinkable
poured
into
a
chalice
nice
clear
brown
look
with
a
tight
head
carbonation
is
fair
the
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
candi
sugar
caramel
malt
and
a
bland
brand
of
dried
fruit
the
taste
is
a
little
weak
with
the
first
couple
of
sips
but
then
after
half
a
glass
the
flavors
of
chocolate
sweet
malt
and
slight
tartness
come
through
the
body
is
a
little
weak
the
coating
of
the
mouth
and
slick
aftertaste
hide
the
body
after
the
first
brew
a
great
session
beer
that
i
would
drink
at
least
every
winterfall
dbig
time
certainly
an
entrylevel
beer
if
you
are
curious
about
climbing
the
belgian
ladder
at
5
6
abv
it
is
very
sessionable
smooth
and
enjoyable
not
a
challenging
beer
but
definitely
knock
some
back
watching
thanksgiving
football
notes
for
the
style
it
claims
to
be
inspired
by
it
does
no
justice
to
the
brew
not
nearly
enough
character
or
complexity
i
would
not
bother
with
this
one
again
and
not
because
it
was
horriblejust
because
it
lacked
soul
mfd
a
little
on
the
watery
side
but
not
bad
lacks
the
flavor
of
a
true
abbey
ale
but
not
bad
in
a
pinch
better
then
i
had
expected
it
to
be
i
would
drink
this
again
md
i
like
it
label
tells
of
a

the

much
like

on

side
there
is
some
roasted

with
just
a
hint
of

in
the

overall
this
is
a
pretty
weak
and
flavorless
seasonal
that
i
would
not
recommend
d
not
bad
a
descent
attempt
by
coors
at
a
belgianstyle
beer
d
not
a
bad
winter
beer
from
coors
interesting
that
they
made
an
abbey
style
beer
but
only
put
it
at
5
6
they
should
have
gone
for
a
more
alcoholic
brew
imo
all
and
all
a
fair
beer
but
not
something
ill
go
back
to
with
so
many
great
winter
warmers
on
the
market
good
for
coors
product
nice
and
sweet
aroma
also
detected
in
the
taste
that
belgian
brown
sugar
that
the
label
boasts
about
must
be
the
reason
not
too
thick
pleasant
consitancy
and
good
carbonation
nice

tastefortheprice
ratio
drinkable
enough
but
not
a

good
abbey
there
are
better
beers
out
there
for
the
money
the
label
on
the
bottle
is
what
drew
me
to
this
one
more
than
anything
all
cozy
in
a
snow
covered
cabin
the
brew
isnt
stellar
but
its
worth
a
look
like
the
other

with
a

amount
of
thick
and
creamy
off
white
head
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
dried
fruits
with
some
raisin
prune
type
scent
and
lots
of
grains
which
was
weird
for
this
style
taste
is
rich
in
grain
flavor
with
a
copper
like
strange
bitter
finish
watery
mouthfeeling
with
a
fruity
like
after
after
taste
pours
a
crisp
pale
orange
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
ring
aroma
was
some
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
spice
taste
was
caramel
with
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
even
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
beer
was
light
and
crisp
with
low
carbonation
this
one
is
somewhat
enjoyable
but
there
are
many
better
winter
brews
out
there
di
could
probably
drink
a
couple
but
would
not
purchace
again
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
even
though
the
abv
is
over
5
0
it
has
a
nice
finish
to
it
a
mellow
yet
lingering
aftertaste
and
is
neither
too
thick
nor
watered
down
im
not
sure
what
blue
moon
was
aiming
for
with
this
but
like
their
belgian
white
this
would
be
a
decent
choice
for
a
vast
majority
of
beer
drinkers
im
glad
i
gave
this
a
try
pours
with
a
decent
size
head
i
love
the
way
this
beer
looks
it
looks
very
warm
yellow
honey
color
it
smells
like
a
macro
lager
tastes
like
a
toastier
macro
lager
not
impressive
worth
a
try
and
only
buy
one
if
you
like
blue
moon
but
not
a
very
good
beer
initially
the
tan
head
is
full
of
life
but
quickly
lies
dormant
leaving
not
much
but
a
memory
atop
the
slightly
hazy
honeycoloured
body
it
offered
promised
but
is
a
letdown
much
like
the
nose
that
lacks
character
beyond
basic
wheat
and
sweet
the
flavor
profile
logically
follows
with
an
active
carbonation
leading
an
artificially
sweet
wheat
with
a
touch
of
citrus
bitterness
that
melds
together
in
a
rather
incongruent
way
read
into
it
and
it
comes
off
more
like
pear
than
berries
the
thin
and
watery
body
does
not
help
a
bastardization
of
blue
moon
not
a
winter
warmer
far
from
a
belgians
complexity
or
darkness
nor
interesting
in
a
good
way
reeks
of
marketing
capitalizing
on
a
brand
names
proven
formula
stick
with
the
original
hmm
at
first
sniff
and
taste
it
seems
like
a
toastier
version
of
blue
moon
sure
its
not
bad
but
there
isnt
much
abbey
about
this
the
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
and
theres
nice
lacing
but
its
a
little
heavy
on
the
spice
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
i
think
i
wouldnt
call
this
belgian
or
even
very
good
but
kudos
to
coors
for
making
a
decent
beer
since
i
had
not
sampled
a
coors
product
in
at
least
10
years
i
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
real
honest
shot
it
poured
great
and
had
a
nice
amber
color
that
reminded
me
of
a
darkish
maerzen
the
first
sip
wasnt
too
bad
either
because
i
could
detect
a
wisp
of
malt
it
was
all
down
hill
from
there
there
was
this
synthetic
or
artificial
mouthfeel
that
didnt
make
me
feel
comfortable
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
too
bitter
too
i
need
someone
to
finish
off
the
rest
of
this
six
pack
for
me
it
poured
well
a
nice
looking
golden
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
is
suprisingly
lacey
the
smell
wasnt
anything
special
no
hints
of
any
special
flavors
taste
was
mediocre
at
best
not
the
kind
of
thing
id
expect
from
blue
moon
nothing
special
again
mouthfeel
was
alright
again
nothing
noticable
drinkablility
for
this
was
average
this
is
an
average
beer
if
you
like
blue
moon
get
original
pours
a
darker
amber
with
a
moderate
cushy
head
smells
of
spice
and
malt
with
a
metallic
hint
tastes
warm
and
sharp
more
alcohol
than
spice
feels
moderate
with
a
lingering
spicy
metallic
finish
wouldnt
be
bad
to
drink
on
a
cold
day
there
isnt
much
more
to
say
screw
this
comment
length
pours
a
medium
amber
with
ruddy
brown
overtones
and
an
initially
fluffy
head
that
dissipates
in
no
time
dull
aromas
of
sweetness
and
cooked
grains
some
faint
doughy
spices
linger
in
the
background
but
the
overall
effect
is
shapeless
and
uninspired
on
the
palate
sweet
with
some
gingery
citrus
notes
first
off
before
offsweet
adjunct
flavors
take
over
the
midpalate
the
finish
sticks
to
the
palate
with
soursweet
tenacity
ugh
there
is
really
nothing
to
recommend
this
beer
if
you
want
a
belgianstyle
beer
i
assume
thats
what
theyre
going
for
since
the
label
calls
this
an
abbey
ale
there
are
many
other
places
to
go
if
you
want
a
fullbodied
winter
beer
the
same
applies
avoid
d
pretty
drinkable
stuff
i
could
easily
down
this
sixer
and
be
content
id
pick
it
up
over
the
regular
blue
moon
any
day
of
the
week
overall
not
bad
id
say
its
worth
picking
up
a
single
and
giving
it
a
try
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
flavor
rather
mild
not
too
much
of
a
belgianyyeasty
flavor
drinkable
and
smooth
not
incredible
but
decent
nonetheless
poured
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
georgeous
white
head
that
lasted
for
a
long
time
aroma
was
almost
nonexistent
and
nothing
was
really
discernible
the
taste
did
not
live
up
to
the
beautiful
appearance
very
bland
slightly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
lacing
on
the
glass
was
excellent
the
aroma
and
taste
were
severely
lacking
but
since
nothing
was
really
offensive
the
drinkability
is
average
bought
a
six
pack
of
full
moon
since
i
have
enjoyed
blue
moon
products
in
the
past
anyway
i
was
very
disappointed
after
i
had
one
smell
was
very
sugary
with
little
else
taste
was
bland
with
the
taste
of
you
guest
it
sugar
not
recommended
by
me
there
are
much
better
winter
beers
out
there
then
this
one
da
decent
winter
ale
for
the
person
who
drinks
a
basic
macro
as
his
go
to
beer
this
is
just
too
lightly
flavored
for
my
tastes
in
a
winter
ale
but
its
not
a
horrible
beer
by
any
means
full
moon
delivers
as
an
enjoyable
mild
belgianstyle
winter
warmer
worth
a
try
drinkability
personally
i
would
avoid
this
beer
is
so
hard
to
find
during
the
season
this
is
ok
stuff
next
edit
the
beers
taste
does
improve
a
little
after
it
warms
still
not
great
though
2008
version
update
much
better
nice
head
and
some
decent
lacing
good
crisp
scent
nice
hint
of
cherry
and
sugar
in
the
taste
goes
down
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
year
this
beer
looks
very
interesting
but
i
found
it
to
be
subpar
not
quite
sure
why
i
keep
pursuing
coors
blue
moon
brand
the
white
is
average
at
best
the
pumpkin
is
lacking
and
this
winter
offering
falls
short
also
i
keep
hoping
for
something
from
this
brand
that
just
never
really
materializes
like
most
selections
from
the
blue
moon
brewing
co
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
wonderful
seasonal
variety
thats
definitely
worth
a
try
the
distinct
taste
of
belgian
sugar
definitely
stands
out
and
a
nice
combination
of
oilysweetness
dominates
this
brew
although
released
in
the
late
fallearly
winter
i
would
enjoy
this
drink
year
round
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
blue
moon
and
winter
varieties
the
candied
sweetness
lingers
on
your
tongue
after
one
or
two
beers
can
be
enjoyed
with
just
about
anything
especially
sweets
i
really
liked
this
beer
tried
this
on
a
whim
as
it
is
not
really
cool
enough
yet
for
a
winter
ale
in
my
area
appearance
was
average
looked
a
lot
like
a
big
brewery
attempt
at
an
amber
nice
head
on
first
pouring
but
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
retention
the
aromas
were
a
bit
weak
to
my
mind
i
like
a
more
assertive
aroma
from
my
beer
light
hoppy
scent
just
the
merest
hint
of
spice
malt
seemed
to
come
through
the
strongest
taste
was
the
same
not
very
assertive
i
agree
with
some
of
the
other
reviews
that
this
is
less
an
attempt
at
crafting
a
good
winter
ale
than
it
is
an
attempt
to
garner
some
of
the
winter
ale
market
share
without
offending
anyone
a
little
better
than
most
large
brew
concoctions
but
no
need
to
worry
about
cluttering
your
walls
with
awards
on
this
one
the
fact
that
the
taste
is
so
inoffensive
makes
it
quite
drinkable
but
this
will
not
become
my
standard
ale
for
the
cold
weather
d
it
has
a
good
taste
and
is
smooth
i
think
i
could
drink
this
all
xmas
morning
while
opening
gifts
up
yea
ok
we
can
do
this
well
the
bottle
says
an
abby
ale
brewed
with
a
hint
of
dark
belgian
candy
sugars
as
if
they
are
passing
this
beer
off
as
a
true
abbey
in
all
actuallity
the
beer
begins
with
an
aroma
thats
chocked
full
of
raw
cereal
grains
and
with
a
peculliar
acrid
chalky
character
due
to
added
sugars
the
beer
holds
no
depth
into
anything
abbeylike
however
the
beer
does
have
some
underlying
malt
barley
flavors
and
aromas
decorated
with
a
dry
spiciness
and
light
fruitiness
apples
and
peaches
beyond
that
the
hop
character
may
offset
the
sweetness
but
offers
no
flavor
aromatic
qualities
is
the
beer
a
disaster
well
no
but
it
surely
falls
short
of
its
timid
claims
its
drinkable
because
the
flavors
are
quite
clean
but
its
a
far
cry
from
true
abbeystyle
beers
d
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
candidate
for
a
winter
session
with
a
few
friends
for
the
price
not
bad
at
all

my

bought
this
for
me
today
while
shopping
at
wegmans
man
i
love
my
wife
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
slight
hazed
bronze
color
with
a
tight
formed
12
finger
white
head
that
actually
held
some
decent
retentionfaint
toasted
malt
aromas
a
touch
of
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
as
well
as
a
touch
of
clove
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
flavor
wise
its
a
bit
toasty
with
some
residual
caramel
sweetness
that
vanilla
that
everyone
talks
about
to
me
is
faint
it
seems
a
little
spiced
but
not
overly
so
it
has
a
spicy
finish
but
not
overdone
anew
recipe
for
2007iam
not
flabbergasted
by
it
by
any
means
but
you
know
its
not
horrible
i
wouldnt
be
ashamed
to
serve
this
to
by
beerliking
friends
really
iam
serious
i
went
into
this
not
having
had
a
blue
moon
beer
in
years
and
with
an
open
mind
still
what
i
find
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
ultimately
a
very
short
journey
to
a
place
that
is
smack
dab
in
the
middle
of
mediocretown
if
they
can
manage
to
bolden
those
flavors
make
some
things
stand
out
and
replace
the
blandness
with
some
character
then
this
could
be
a
winner
until
they
do
that
though
its
drinkable
only
if
nothing
else
better
is
available
i
guess
not
everybody
wants
to
aim
high
labelled
full
moon
on
my
bottle
amber
beer
with
a
small
light
tan
head
that
does
not
linger
not
much
aroma
what
there
is
is
sweet
malts
and
maybe
some
yeast
taste
is
mostly
malts
sweet
touch
of
spice
especially
on
the
back
of
the
throat
and
some
yeast
ok
on
the
palate
i
found
the
highish
carbonation
cleaned
the
sugary
taste
out
fast
which
is
good
over
all
not
really
a
bad
beer
at
all
rather
drinkable
the
label
claims
this
is
abbey
ale
brewed
with
a
hint
of
dark
belgian
sugar
i
think
not
d
maybe
a
bit
to
sweet
to
drink
all
afternoon
but
not
overpowering
drinks
pretty
good
but
a
bit
of
a
weak
sister
of
a
winter
warmer
buck
this
up
more
with
malt
you
have
a

ontap

improper
this
is

more
than
a
spicier
english
winter
warmer
medium

sourish
not

for

but
a

beer
for
sure
im
not
sure
i
am
reviewing
the
right
beer
blue
moon
full
moon
is
the
winter
seasonal
for
blue
moon
it
is
a
completely
new
recipe
and
new
beer
from
last
years
winter
i
guess
we
have
kind
of
combined
the
two
of
them
on
this
website
this
years
version
is
an
abbey
ale
the
appearance
is
amber
and
strong
with
little
smell
the
taste
however
is
strong
dark
and
sugary
very
nice
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
as
good
as
it
gets
the
perfect
thickness
and
i
could
drink
a
lot
more
of
these
than
i
could
most
abbey
ales
the
beer
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
three
fingered
creamy
off
white
head
that
fades
leaving
a
decent
covering
of
lace
nose
has
a
nice
malt
sweetness
hints
of
spices
caramel
fresh
and
pleasant
start
has
an
adequate
grain
presence
the
spices
sweet
and
a
bit
tart
top
is
light
finish
has
a
nice
spice
presence
hops
acceptable
quite
dry
and
sweet
lingering
aftertaste
must
say
i
found
this
beer
quite
drinkable
and
the
best
of
all
the
¬ìblue
moon¬î
beers
this
is
essentially
a
sweetened
amber
ale
it
has
the
flavor
profile
of
an
amber
with
some
of
that
familiar
sometimes
off
putting
bitterness
the
hint
of
belgian
sugar
the
bottle
claims
is
in
here
tones
down
or
covers
up
some
of
the
potentially
less
appealing
characteristics
frankly
i
enjoyed
the
winter
warmer
that
was
released
directly
under
the
coors
label
it
struck
me
as
being
a
bolder
a
bit
spicier
and
a
bit
more
flavorful
this
stuff
aint
so
bad
though
when
consumed
straight
from
the
bottle
the
flavors
seem
more
concentrated
if
youre
looking
for
a
stronger
presence
out
of
this
winter
warmer
i
recommend
that
course
for
something
lighter
pour
it
in
a
glass
and
let
it
warm
drinkability
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
it
looked
interesting
and
i
wanted
to
see
what
they
could
do
with
what
they
tout
as
an
abbey
ale
turns
out
i
probably
shouldve
opted
for
something
else
not
too
bad
but
if
youre
thinking
of
a
belgian
which
should
probably
not
be
domestic
in
this
case
you
may
want
to
stick
with
something
you
know
and
like
aftertaste
is
slightly
cloying
and
unpleasantly
synthetic
looks
good
smells
good
but
umm
well
thats
about
it
this
does
not
taste
spititout
bad
and
its
okay
once
it
warms
up
a
little
its
too
sweet
and
sugary
which
may
appeal
to
some
people
but
not
me
this
definitely
has
some
potential
but
for
now
id
pass
unless
you
dont
mind
a
sweet
tasting
brew
oh
well
not
one
i
would
buy
again
overall
i
was
hoping
for
better
there
are
no
flavors
in
here
that
i
really
like
i
could
see
myself
only
having
this
one
time
a
night
sigh
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
medium
copper
forming
a
1
inch
slightly
tan
head
the
head
fades
to
a
14
inch
head
leaving
medium
spots
of
lace
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
sugar
and
spice
along
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
consists
of
a
light
vanilla
flavor
along
with
light
malt
and
maybe
a
hint
of
spices
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
notasintense
version
of
abs
vanilla
cask
ale
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
the
label
would
lead
you
to
think
go
figure
medium
mouthfeel
not
bad
for
a
holiday
beer
but
there
are
still
others
way
better
overall
worth
the
6
for
a
sixer
try
it
i
bought
this
beer
from
an
abc
liquor
store
a
couple
days
ago
winter
ale
in
october
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
brew
has
a
nice
smell
of
spice
and
winter
not
a
bad
job
from
coors
honestly
very
drinkable
the
spice
is
not
overpowering
but
i
believe
balanced
well
with
the
dark
sugar
picked
up
this
earlier
this
week
i
dont
know
why
its
already
out
now
called
full
moon
in
the
second
week
of
october
wheres
the
pumpkin
spice
very
nice
copper
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
with
a
tint
of
copper
sweet
malty
aroma
tastes
alot
like
a
darker
sweeter
version
of
the
original
blue
moon
very
malty
with
hints
of
light
hops
that
give
it
some
bitterness
the
aftertaste
isnt
bad
but
it
is
a
bit
dry
it
is
pretty
good
for
a
winter
ale
like
it
says
worth
a
try
d
barely
average
but
ill
give
it
a
3
based
on
a
gorgeous
look
a
goodinteresting
aroma
flavor
was
muddy
but
fair
and
mouthfeel
is
a
detractor
liked
this
the
first
couple
sips
then
the
novelty
wore
off
by
midglass
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
finish
and
even
considered
dumping
some
somewhat
fun
worth
a
try
then
move
on
i
was
somewhat
confused
about
a
seasonal
beer
from
blue
moon
is
it
a
wheat
beer
is
it
a
winter
ale
is
it
worth
trying
it
turned
out
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
not
much
of
an
aroma
to
it
but
the
caramel
kicks
in
on
the
first
taste
not
in
the
same
league
as
sam
adams
or
harpoon
but
definitely
worth
a
taste
d
there
is
something
just
not
totally
right
with
this
beer
lack
of
body
and
odd
vanilla
flavors
just
at
me
first
lack
of
real
malt
density
flavor
does
this
one
is
when
it
comes
down
to
it
take
this
one
back
to
the
chalk
board
drinkability
for
me
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
the
vanilla
flavor
doesnt
come
off
as
syrupy
or
cloying
to
me
keeping
this
beery
enough
for
session
consumption
i
can
say
that
id
rather
drink
this
than
icehouse
or
coors
light
interesting
because
coors
makes
this
but
thats
about
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
about
it
stay
away
from
this
one
or
just
buy
one
bottle
and
see
if
you
like
it
first
before
buying
a
whole
6
pack
d
although
this
beer
has
some
syrupy
flavors
they
are
not
overly
sweet
just
a
little
chemical
tasting
there
isnt
much
malt
flavor
behind
the
caramel
notes
but
the
finish
is
clean
so
the
flavors
dont
hang
on
the
tongue
d
kind
of
tasty
but
way
too
sweet
for
me
goes
down
easy
slightly
filling
i
definitely
would
not
drink
this
one
again
d
i
applaud
the
effort
but
i
cant
stand
this
i
can
see
where
some
people
would
love
it
and
if
it
gets
more
people
to
try
craft
beer
then
im
behind
it
in
theory
but
i
cant
drink
it
overall
this
is
a
quite
tasty
winter
warmer
perhaps
a
few
spices
added
into
the
mix
could
help
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
thin
bodied
otherwise
its
probably
one
of
the
best
coors
beers
ive
had
finish
is
short
with
touch
of
nutty
sweetness
but
not
much
else
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
printed
on
the
bottle
by
the
neck
label
describes
it
as
an
amber
ale
with
winter
spices
id
call
it
liquid
praline
it
poured
with
a
good
couple
finger
head
that
slowly
dissipated
it
was
a
solid
amber
color
and
had
good
carb
the
smell
was
deadon
praline
with
some
vanilla
in
background
great
smell
for
a
soda
but
not
for
a
beer
the
taste
was
basically
the
same
as
the
smell
and
again
great
for
a
cream
soda
but
not
a
beer
not
sure
what
they
were
trying
to
do
here
but
it
didnt
work
for
me
im
extremely
glad
that
i
got
this
as
a
single
instead
of
a
6ixer
highly
recommend
that
you
avoid
unless
you
are
looking
for
a
cream
soda
1
5
na
ml
n
personally
i
like
my
beers
to
tase
like
beer
not
cream
soda
then
again
thats
just
my
opinion
the
beer
had
a
nice
color
to
it
but
i
thought
i
was
drinking
mug
cream
soda
and
after
a
couple
of
sips
i
wanted
to
vomit
i
ended
up
giving
the
other
5
beers
away
i
would
only
recomended
if
you
like
sweet
candy
tasting
beers
but
otherwise
steer
clear
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
it
was
thin
and
had
an
artificial
taste
like
i
was
drinking
cold
runny
maple
syrup
also
the
smell
seemed
to
linger
long
after
the
beer
was
gone
it
was
not
a
pleasent
experience
whicb
is
a
suprise
because
i
am
fond
of
the
regular
blue
moon
this
however
was
not
a
good
effort
i
would
avoid
this
beer
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
its
not
very
balanced
but
still
delicious
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
drank
from
coors
ever
drinkability
didnt
finish
a
bottle
too
watery
drinkability
going
through
one
was
tough
now
ive
got
5
left
what
to
do
with
those
i
hate
when
this
happens
drinkability
a
halfway
approach
to
a
winter
beer
artificial
and
thin
tasting
pours
a
clear
mahoganyamber
with
an
offwhite
creamy
three
finger
head
decent
retention
but
minimal
lacing
vanilla
bean
and
ginger
in
the
nose
with
strong
caramel
and
toffee
notes
some
background
crystal
malt
aroma
pale
malt
and
crystal
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
mild
cinnamon
and
ginger
flavors
then
an
assertive
caramel
taste
the
semidry
aftertaste
shows
some
mellow
english
hops
mabye
fuggle
or
east
kent
goldings
the
caramel
taste
is
really
pronounced
and
kind
of
drowns
out
everything
else
but
the
flavor
remains
mostly
balanced
medium
in
body
with
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
its
smooth
and
has
some
texture
but
could
have
been
a
little
less
crisp
to
preserve
the
maltiness
finishes
mellow
and
drinkable
with
lingering
caramel
and
soft
english
hop
character
last
few
swigs
present
a
ghostlike
hefeyeast
notes
coors
has
produced
another
affordable
craft
beer
with
respectable
complexity
and
a
high
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
surprisingly
so
since
it
carries
the
blue
moon
label
but
i
suppose
that
underscores
the
thought
that
you
shouldn¬ít
prejudge
flavor
is
not
incredible
but
overall
this
is
a
very
decent
beer
worth
a
try
an
enjoyable
winter
brew
with
some
unique
spices
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
overall
come
to
think
about
it
this
is
a
lighter
version
of
the
style
just
like
regular
blue
moon
white
is
a
light
tasting
version
of
a
wit
not
bad
for
a
change
of
pace
type
beer
did
someone
say
crossover
beer
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
say
the
least
my
buddy
picked
up
a
few
and
immediatly
because
he
does
not
like
many
beers
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
either
exceptional
or
well
below
par
i
was
however
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
taste
of
familiar
winter
flavors
in
it
that
i
did
not
expect
and
a
smell
that
that
was
equally
pleasant
i
would
suggest
this
a
beer
to
appreciate
and
enjoy
but
i
couldnt
have
more
than
two
at
a
time
because
i
felt
as
though
i
was
being
selfish
or
spoiling
myself
bottom
line
though
if
given
the
chance
definatly
partake
in
this
one
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
blue
moon
winter
ale
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
good
sized
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
too
it
smells
sweet
like
caramel
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
fresh
baked
cookies
yeah
i
know
that
sounds
weird
it
has
a
nutty
taste
along
with
caramel
and
vanilla
it
does
have
a
slight
bittersour
aftertaste
which
gets
less
bittersour
as
the
beer
warms
but
overall
the
taste
is
mostly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
little
bit
creamy
the
drinkability
is
good
too
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
more
than
2
or
3
at
a
time
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
i
really
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
but
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
taste
is
the
best
out
of
all
of
the
blue
moon
family
i
have
ever
had
extremely
lavish
with
caramel
flavor
amongst
vanilla
and
almost
a
nutty
taste
finishing
up
each
sip
leaves
me
anticipating
the
next
drinkability
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
3
overall
impression
not
the
most
exciting
seasonal
out
there
but
not
too
bad
either
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
many
i
tried
this
beer
on
tap
at
sky
in
sudbury
ma
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
the
head
was
creamy
and
the
mouthfeel
was
full
it
has
a
gingerbread
aftertaste
that
i
liked
it
reminded
me
of
anderson
valleys
winter
solstice
of
several
years
ago
i
hope
this
is
available
in
16ths
mahogany
brown
in
color
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
bubbles
a
fingernail
of
khaki
head
surrounds
the
rim
and
forms
a
circle
in
the
middle
of
the
chalice
aroma
is
of
dates
chestnuts
and
dark
candy
sugar
the
taste
is
dark
malt
and
dark
candy
sugar
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
that
in
turn
prickles
your
tongue
it
is
also
dry
and
warming
to
your
throat
outstanding
dubbel
i
dont
care
if
i
was
star
struck
by
the
name
i
loved
it
o
this
was
a
pretty
old
bottle
in
review
can
you
say
plum
2012
bottle
very
smooth
subtle
carbonation
very
tasty
sweet
but
not
as
cloying
as
other
quads
wish
i
had
more
overall
not
a
style
i
love
but
its
really
well
made
another
amazing
beer
to
die
for
this
is
outstanding
the
more
i
drink
this
and
westy
12
i
am
convinced
that
they
reign
along
with
rochefort
in
the
trappist
ale
category
as
well
as
the
belgian
dark
category
in
general
beer
brewed
with
passion
get
some
drank
along
side
6
other
dubbels
in
a
blind
tasting
finished
top
3
but
not
overall
favorite
of
the
group
tied
with
rochefort
6
very
warm
alcoholic
malty
beginning
with
plums
and
raisins
fitting
carbonation
helping
the
beer
from
becoming
too
heavy
malt
in
comparison
to
other
brunes
isnt
too
sweet
gets
mixed
up
with
an
enjoyable
spicy
bitterness
earthy
bready
and
warm
malts
define
this
beer
wrapped
up
in
honey
as
the
beer
warms
up
great
balance
decent
complexity
smooth
mouthfeel
medium

and

safely
back

murky

that
sticks

aroma
is
dry
funky
barnyard
yeast
surprisingly
grassy
light
spices
with
low
sweetness
on
the
nose
but
for
some
raisins
and
figs
flavor
begins
with
a
punch
of
sweet
figs
and
pears
and
raisins
balanced
by
a
crisp
grassy
hop
finish
plenty
of
dry
barnyard
funk
here
from
the
yeast
medium
bodied
but
lightened
up
considerably
by
the
high
carbonation
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
definitely
lighter
than
its
12
counterpart
overall
a
very
nice
brew
but
maybe
not
quite
living
up
to
the
considerable
price
tag
worth
trying
but
dont
kill
yourself
over
it
if
u
can
find
it
buy
it
then
without
hesitation
drink
up
overall
another
solid
exceptional
example
of
what
a
belgian
dubbel
should
be
those
monks
know
what
theyre
doing
bold
and
firm
this
mohoganny
brew
shows
tremendous
complexity
and
focus
with
a
warming
full
body
supporting
notes
of
raisins
caramel
grape
chocolate
coffee
fruit
yeast
and
god
knows
what
else
no
joke
intended
the
finish
is
long
and
expressive
and
overall
the
beer
is
abound
with
stand
out
features
edit
tried
it
again
at
abbey
st
sixtus
along
with
the
12
and
the
blonde
and
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
three
definitely
better
this
time
around
loved
it
one
of
the
best
aromas
on
a
dubbel
ive
ever
had
but
not
one
id
make
a
particular
effort
to
seek
out
and
didnt
love
nearly
as
much
as
the
quad
or
the
pale
o
easily
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
very
complex
in
both
the
nose
and
palate
with
a
very
good
mouthfeel
reminds
me
a
lot
of
westvleteren
12
in
its
flavour
profile
but
quite
a
bit
more
drinkable
overall
really
good
beer
that
is
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
but
just
doesnt
quite
have
what
it
takes
to
be
one
of
the
great
ones
i
dont
even
really
understand
this
beers
placement
in
the
top
250
but
i
also
wasnt
terribly
impressed
with
12
either
im
sure
some
of
its
the
hype
and
some
of
its
differing
taste
buds
but
if
you
have
the
money
to
blow
i
would
say
give
this
a
try
at
least
youll
be
able
to
say
you
did
verdict
a
masterful
take
on
the
dubbel
and
perhaps
the
best
in
show
for
that
style
hard
to
find
another
contender
this
complex
and
well
rounded
the
balance
is
spot
on
and
the
depth
and
complexity
of
the
flavors
is
inspired
the
monks
certainly
know
how
to
make
a
fine
ale
o
not
quite
as
complex
or
intricate
as
the
quad
but
this
is
certainly
the
best
dubbel
i
have
tried
very
tasty
even
being
this
fresh
great
beer
whoa
this
beer
here
i
made
a
bad
decision
on
drinking
this
beer
after
pounding
down
some
st
bernardis
and
tripel
this
beer
has
an
intense
taste
strong
as
heck
this
beer
definitely
leaves
a
lingering
taste
in
your
mouth
cheerston
this
beer
take
your
time
with
this
one
12oz
bottle
pours
a
murky
amber
topped
with
a
thin
yet
bubbly
tan
head
this
retains
with
some
light
ringing
that
leaves
back
a
smattering
of
spotty
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
smells
of
ripe
fruit
spice
and
sweet
sugars
a
smidge
of
light
alcohol
roast
and
some
darker
fruit
character
add
some
edge
to
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
pretty
much
mirrors
the
aroma
with
a
rich
and
flavorful
mix
of
tropical
and
dark
fruits
toffee
and
brown
sugar
spice
works
itself
into
the
profile
effortlessly
giving
things
a
zesty
edge
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
crispness
to
the
carbonation
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
heft
sits
underneath
but
overall
this
is
extremely
smooth
in
the
mouth
for
an
8
beer
this
is
a
really
impeccable
dubbel
with
a
richness
and
smoothness
to
the
flavors
which
just
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
fantastic
beer
this
is
certainly
a
wellmade
solid
and
dry
beer
id
go
so
far
as
to
say
its
easily
one
of
the
best
bsdas
ive
ever
had
not
sure
it
quite
deserves
the
hype
in
relation
to
beers
of
certain
other
styles
however
ifwhen
i
drink
future
westys
i
will
try
to
get
them
with
more
age
on
them
as
that
is
supposed
to
improve
them
substantially
deep
chestnut
brown
a
bit
murky
aromas
of
sweet
malts
fruity
yeast
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
particularly
raisin
the
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
with
some
brightness
in
the
malt
from
the
creamy
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
with
an
oily
viscous
feel
the
only
mark
against
this
beer
is
some
slight
solvent
alcohol
flavor
on
the
finish
iso
i
had
an
open
mind
and
was
maybe
expecting
the
hype
train
to
be
in
full
swing
but
was
pleasantly
surpised
to
find
that
everything
folks
say
about
westy
is
true
top
stuff
pour
is
simply
beautiful
the
taste
has
to
be
as
close
to
perfection
as
i
have
had
although
i
readily
admit
i
rate
most
beers
higher
than
others
its
all
good
right
i
love
how
the
brew
is
light
and
fluid
yet
firm
enough
to
hold
the
still
floating
sediment
on
the
top
thin
layer
im
not
intimidated
by
the
degree
of
difficulty
in
obtaining
this
brew
or
at
least
not
reflecting
it
in
the
rating
i
believe
this
is
a
great
specimen
and
i
wish
there
were
more
available
whale
status
from
drlovemd87
this
has
been
a
long
time
want
i
have
to
say
i
was
more
impressed
by
this
than
by
the
12
not
that
its
that
much
better
or
anything
but
in
the
context
of
all
quads
westy
12
was
excellent
but
has
beers
in
the
context
of
all
dubbels
westy
8
stands
alone
at
the
top
in
my
mind
in
terms
of
quality
hazy
amber
color
to
this
dull
looking
really
with
a
fizzy
off
white
head
not
really
all
that
impressive
to
look
at
the
nose
on
this
is
great
though
its
just
exuding
a
wonderful
belgian
yeast
strain
that
i
can
say
has
no
equal
in
combination
with
a
sweeter
malt
profile
gentle
candy
sugar
and
raisin
type
fruitiness
i
can
say
that
this
is
one
incredible
aromatic
profile
the
taste
is
just
like
the
nose
very
straightforward
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
is
its
simplicity
not
that
the
flavors
are
not
complex
but
this
is
brewing
art
it
its
purist
clean
flavors
i
taste
the
grain
i
taste
the
sugar
burnt
caramel
like
is
how
it
comes
through
and
i
taste
the
yeast
which
may
be
my
favorite
strain
going
the
finish
is
sweet
indeed
but
its
a
pleasurable
sweet
and
one
that
feels
right
in
the
mouth
expressive
mouth
feel
very
lively
and
bright
for
the
style
not
weighed
down
by
either
its
sugars
or
its
alcohol
strength
a
really
splendid
beer
yeast
forward
and
perfectly
executed
this
is
the
standard
for
the
style
hands
down
i
should
also
mention
that
i
had
the
esteemed
privilege
to
drink
all
three
of
these
beers
in
one
session
and
the
8
was
the
pick
for
me
i
am
truly
blessed
o
well
its
a
great
pleasure
again
to
drink
and
review
this
beer
in
particular
on
xmas
day
still
one
of
my
favourite
beers
and
although
i
believe
it
is
inferior
to
the
12
it
i
s
still
a
great
complex
and
delicious
beer
to
consume
highly
recommend
excellent
but
not
head
and
shoulders
above
others
in
the
style
as
the
scores
would
suggest
with
the
robust
maltiness
and
restrained
sweetness
i
find
that
westy
8
is
quite
similar
to
ommegang
abbey
ale
m
medium
bodied
o
i
dont
smoke
but
could
see
a
cigar
pairing
well
with
this
beer
i
think
its
the
overall
composition
with
the
mouthfeel
head
retention
scent
and
taste
that
make
this
beer
one
of
the
worlds
most
sought
after
beers
i
went
to
in
de
verde
and
picked
up
a
case
of
6
less
than
2
weeks
ago
love
it
refined
classic
brew
that
will
keep
you
sipping
expectations
were
high
but
this
beer
was
higher
even
definitely
the
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
too
bad
its
hard
and
expensive
to
find
i
am
sure
this
is
a
great
beer
just
not
my
style
and
i
also
tried
it
both
times
pretty
young
i
bet
i
would
like
it
a
lot
more
with
some
age
on
it
it
was
fun
to
chase
down
but
i
will
probably
never
do
it
again
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
i
think
the
hype
is
bigger
and
better
then
the
beer
itself
again
i
think
it
was
made
stylistically
correct
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
anyone
needs
to
experince
sint
sixtusabdijs
and
the
dubbel
8
is
worth
the
trip
beer
is
medium
weight
in
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
levels
prickly
as
it
moves
across
the
palete
but
fairly
quickly
becoming
foamy
and
smooth
on
the
palate
closes
dryly
with
light
stickiness
on
the
palate
overall
a
very
good
beer
the
flavors
are
a
bit
more
like
a
small
quad
than
that
of
a
large
dubbel
the
dryness
took
me
by
surprise
a
great
belgian
but
its
much
better
on
draft
at
the
source
ov
a
very
tasty
brew
that
im
glad
i
purchased
and
got
to
try
the
flavours
while
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
are
very
well
balanced
and
blend
nicely
together
it
goes
down
very
easy
for
an
8er
a
really
good
sipper
o
im
disappointed
by
this
its
certainly
tasty
and
quite
balanced
but
its
not
mindblowing
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
a
great
experience
hope
the
12
holds
up
o
not
as
much
dark
fruit
or
complexity
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
style
but
its
still
a
great
beer
imho
it
drinks
like
a
fantastic
belgian
brown
ale
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
pretty
nice
maybe
better
than
westy
12
but
not
sure
tasty
beer
aside
from
the
oxidation
which
is
very
light
on
the
flavor
im
impressed
how
it
gets
the
sweet
characters
but
not
syrupy
at
all
poured
out
as
a
deep
amber
brown
color
with
a
quick
fading
tan
head
on
top
there
isnt
much
retention
or
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
give
off
some
belgian
spice
notes
with
some
cherry
and
vanilla
in
the
mix
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
bready
spicy
slightly
sweet
and
earthy
the
mouthfeel
is
very
well
carbonated
and
has
a
slight
booziness
in
the
finish
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
but
its
nothing
overly
special
i
believe
the
challenge
of
getting
these
beers
adds
to
the
hype
which
reflects
the
initial
score
of
them
its
good
just
not
as
good
as
the
score
on
here
shows
othis
is
a
very
good
dubbel
the
looks
in
particular
are
a
example
for
others
to
follow
the
nose
is
a
bit
too
aggressive
for
me
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
solid
interestingly
this
beer
is
much
less
sweet
and
more
peppery
than
the
xii
o
overall
i
was
happily
impressed
by
this
beer
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
this
is
easily
the
best
dubbel
that
i
have
ever
drank
its
just
wonderful
benchmark
for
the
beer
style
westy
8
is
as
good
as
they
say
it
is
ive
had
dubbels
which
ive
enjoyed
a
lot
westvleteren
just
topped
that
list
with
its
own
with
its
combination
of
great
taste
and
drinkability
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
westvleteren
family
o
im
really
impressed
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
westy
8
this
was
my
last
bottle
from
my
trip
to
belgium
3
years
ago
i
shed
a
few
tears
as
i
finished
it
but
really
enjoyed
it
at
the
cafe
de
verve
time
to
move
on
from
the
blond
and
move
up
one
step
to
the
dubbel
this
beer
is
dark
brown
cloudy
appearance
with
medium
sized
and
amount
of
co2
bubbles
roasted
malt
flavor
with
an
alcohol
end
note
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
present
missing
the
dark
ripe
estery
fruits
normally
found
in
dubbels
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
creamy
and
heavy
with
a
nice
smoothness
and
drinkable
this
beer
ends
with
a
dark
roasted
malt
quality
with
a
hint
of
spicinessmore
hoppy
than
yeasty
pours
a
dark
brown
copper
colour
with
a
big
creamy
off
white
head
with
great
retention
strong
aroma
of
dried
fruit
mostly
plum
also
a
bit
of
caramel
and
tobacco
notes
flavour
is
very
smooth
low
carbonation
light
dried
fruit
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
well
balanced
bitterness
also
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
excellent
beer
i
have
a
westy
12
in
my
refrigerator
and
i
have
never
had
that
one
absolutely
ecstatic
to
try
will
be
reviewing
that
beer
shortly
thanks
for
the
read
o
superb
complexity
that
develops
in
the
glass
and
highly
drinkable
i
prefer
the
8
to
the
12
purely
on
my
own
palate
both
are
truly
fantastic
beers
overall
a
great
dubbel
better
than
the
westmalle
i
dont
think
so
equal
probably
overall
really
good
beer
but
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
in
my
opinion
considering
the
great
effort
or
cost
that
goes
into
obtaining
this
ill
be
sticking
to
more
readily
available
options
in
the
future
o
an
incredibly
special
beer
incredibly
i
wasnt
blown
away
with
the
blonde
actually
disappointed
which
made
me
skeptical
about
how
this
one
would
be
but
this
one
lives
up
to
its
fetishized
name
with
that
said
im
not
jumping
up
and
down
saying
this
is
the
most
delicious
beer
ive
ever
had
dubbels
are
not
my
style
but
this
one
is
the
holy
grail
of
dubbels
magical
it
was
worth
the
10
euros
i
paid
for
it
please
dont
bash
me
o
i
thought
id
missed
the
point
with
the
westy
12
but
now
ive
been
similarly
underwhelmed
by
the
8
if
my
bottle
was
a
typical
example
of
a
two
year
old
bottle
then
it
tastes
very
ordinary
with
a
bit
of
age
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
one
because
all
these
people
cant
be
wrong
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
either
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
grape
juice
and
lots
of
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
and
some
really
tasty
flavors
o
a
very
nice
treat
on
my
birthday
so
thanks
for
the
bottle
dad
met
my
expectations
and
definitely
worth
acquiring
look
forward
to
trying
the
westy
12
some
day
o
very
balanced
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
beer
but
it
lacks
the
big
wow
that
would
make
it
a
true
titan
among
giants

version

overall
extraordinary
one
of
the
best
belgian
beer
i
have
laid
my
hands
on
i
thought
that
all
of
the
westy
beers
were
just
hype
machines
but
this
is
just
magnificent
i
cannot
imagine
that
westy
12
is
any
better
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
small
tan

that
retained
as
a
thin

absolutely
loved
the
aroma
on
this
rich
scents

sweet
raisins
figs
caramel
malts
brown
sugar
belgian
yeast
super
smooth
i
almost
want
to
give
it
a
5
0
the
taste
reflects
the
nose
dried
dark
fruits
mingled
with
smooth
malt
sweetness
dark
sugars
a
touch
of
cocoa
and
a
mellow
but
ubiquitous
booziness
throughout
the
session
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
complex
and
wellcrafted
o
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
no
flaws
every
aspect
is
appealing
if
i
had
a
wish
it
would
be
for
a
bit
more
body
and
complexity
but
now
im
splitting
hairs
o
a
wonderful
beer
in
a
wonderful
location
ill
have
to
call
it
a
tie
for
now
with
prior
8
o
ive
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
a
long
time
so
it
could
easily
have
been
a
letdown
but
it
was
worth
the
wait
this
is
a
wonderful
hand
crafted
work
of
art
the
body
was
crisp
full
and
smooth
drinkability
was
excellent
this
would
be
the
rare
beer
where
i
would
want
a
large
format
bottle
all
to
myself
overall
a
great
beer
worth
whatever
it
takes
to
get
your
hands
on
overall
just
terrific
truly
a
remarkable
beer
definitely
lives
up
to
expectations
i
basically
assumed
the
beer
would
be
good
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
and
it
was
not
in
the
slightest
o
4
cost
12
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
poured
from
bottle
into
westvleteren
glass
at
the
abbey
cafe
on
9812
not
sure
when
bottled
or
any
of
that
pours
a
deep
chocolate
brownie
looking
brown
with
slight
tan
rim
superb
fruity
yeast
aromas
taste
is
really
just
amazing
chocolatey
dried
fruit
and
some
spicevanilla
maybe
super
smooth
and
just
all
around
amazing
although
the
abbey
was
so
over
commercialized
its
still
worth
the
visit
to
try
them
at
the
source
obviously
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
because
there
really
isnt
any
other
choice
this
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
i
am
glad
i
finally
cracked
my
bottle
o
not
quite
as
complex
or
intricate
as
the
quad
but
this
is
certainly
the
best
dubbel
i
have
tried
very
tasty
even
being
this
fresh
o
it
lives
up
to
the
westvleteren
name
however
i
do
not
feel
it
is
worth
the
effort
required
to
seek
out
in
the
us
overall
my
first
westy
did
not
disappoint
i
think
this
is
the
best
dubbel
i
have
had
perhaps
this
beer
is
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
the
blonde
but
considering
the
increased
alcohol
content
it
is
still
fantastically
drinkable
the
flavor
profile
really
is
so
totally
different
its
a
toss
up
which
is
better
but
the
deep
color
and
unquestionably
the
fantastic
aroma
set
this
beer
apart
a
fantastic
dubbel
o
the
best
dubbel
i
have
had
to
date
and
i
dont
imagine
i
will
find
one
i
like
more
great
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
overall
not
usually
a
belgian
beer
fan
but
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
is
powerful
without
the
malty
sweetness
one
would
expect
from
a
higher
abv
full
flavored
and
good
for
sipping
fantastic
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
little
bit
sticky
overall
this
one
is
pretty
well
done
and
incredibly
drinkable
this
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
lively
mouthfeel
awesome
stuff
much
better
than
rochefort
in
my
mind
o
one
of
the
more
flavorful
dubbels
ive
had
the
sweetness
balances
out
the
dark
fruit
and
heat
really
rounding
this
one
out
immensely
ill
have
to
have
my
next
one
of
these
next
to
a
westy
12
since
i
cant
remember
enjoying
the
12
as
much
as
this
beer
this
beer
is
amazing
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
ever
tried
i
was
simply
blown
away
by
this
beer
rich
and
complex
taste
though
not
gamechanging
like
westy
12
finishes
dry
with
malt
and
spices
improves
as
it
warms
good
but
cant
touch
westy
12
arrives
at
the
table
with
a
dense
tan
head
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
but
definitely
not
black
there
are
aromas
of
figs
and
dates
and
a
noticeable
alcohol
presence
on
the
tongue
theres
an
explosion
of
chocolate
and
a
slight
bit
of
raisin
theres
moderate
alcohol
bites
although
the
light
body
belies
the
strength
of
the
beer
very
smooth
and
creamy
this
was
handsdown
our
favorite
of
the
three
westy
beers
o
its
a
good
abbey
beer
to
be
sure
but
is
it
considerably
better
than
something
like
a
westmalle
dubble
i
doubt
it
the
westvleteren
12
is
too
strong
and
not
much
more
complex
though
so
i
think
its
the
best
of
the
overrated
bunch
o
overall
what
a
fantastic
beer
hands
down
the
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
and
its
not
even
close
honestly
drinks
like
a
quad
and
a
great
one
flavors
and
aromas
are
a
little
toned
down
compared
to
the
westy
12
but
i
guess
thats
the
point
of
a
dubbel
no
doubt
the
epitome
of
the
style
world
class
not
your
average
abbey
dubbel
darker
fruits
than
in
other
doubles
no
muddled
flavors
westy
8
is
drinkable
thankfully
balanced
and
has
a
clean
finish
the
aromas
have
both
the
usual
brighter
notes
of
citrus
as
well
as
the
darker
cherries
and
figs
a
complex
blend
that
tastes
as
good
as
it
smells
not
my
favorite
overall
style
but
usually
i
pour
them
out
and
this
one
i
quaffed
with
enjoyment
thanks
to
chris
for
hooking
it
up
around
this
time
last
year
o
a
true
delight
i
really
tried
to
savor
this
one
as
long
as
i
could
o
a
great
beer
that
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
just
like
the
12
this
is
worth
the
hype
and
price
to
try
this
special
beer
got
this
in
a
trade
from
england
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
light
brown
foamy
head
aroma
is
huge
and
delicious
heavy
rich
malts
with
vanilla
and
dark
sweet
fruit
sweet
flavor
that
ends
with
light
bitterness
very
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
perfectly
balanced
throughout
allaround
fantastic
beer
i
love
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
if
it
werent
so
freaking
expensive
note
2
to
4
year
aging
of
this
beer
is
optimal
o
in
short
this
is
one
of
the
most
delicate
well
refined
brews
i
have
ever
had
i
was
unaware
that
a
dubbel
could
carry
such
a
taste
and
i
aspire
to
make
a
trip
to
belgium
soon
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
complex
flavors
and
aromas
o
not
quite
as
amazing
as
i
had
expected
but
that
is
a
common
problem
with
these
types
of
beers
they
tend
to
be
a
bit
overhyped
i
may
have
had
a
bad
bottle
but
this
just
didnt
blow
my
hair
back
like
i
expected
o
good
much
prefer
the
quad
12
but
this
aint
half
bad
didnt
like
some
of
the
vegetal
flavors
but
for
the
most
part
this
was
a
good
one
overall
awesome
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
younger
as
its
a
little
less
boozy
than
i
would
usually
age
but
it
certainly
held
up
fine
drink
a
very
nice
dubbel
very
smooth
and
drinkable
without
being
too
hot
or
too
spicy
as
some
tend
to
be
for
me
4
5
d
a
couple
categories
could
have
been
a
touch
higher
so
4
5
here
this
is
a
lot
like
the
12
super
well
integrated
subtle
and
infinitely
clean
but
unlike
the
12
this
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
subtle
and
you
really
have
to
concentrate
to
enjoy
it
still
good
beer
notes
what
a
treat
and
what
a
surprise
the
last
of
the
excellent
westvleteren
brews
to
try
was
quite
the
special
animal
almost
like
a
combination
of
the
best
of
the
blonde
and
the
10
but
with
its
own
character
the
sense
of
balance
and
change
of
rhythm
in
the
palate
without
losing
a
touch
of
its
structure
is
something
to
remember
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
its
very
flavorful
and
fruity
and
has
a
clean
finish
is
its
the
best
in
the
world
i
dont
know
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
i
was
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
would
not
trade
my
cellar
for
it
purchased
from
tanakaya
in
mejiro
tokyo
poured
into
an
also
newly
purchased
trappistes
rochefort
widerimmed
goblet
i
cant
even
begin
to
describe
this
wonderful
brew
in
words
that
conform
to
a
language
i
speak
a
lovely
caramelcolored
head
covered
the
blackbrown
brew
from
beginning
to
end
releasing
all
of
the
magical
scents
that
again
escape
known
words
i
drank
it
and
it
warmed
my
soul
then
i
drank
more
and
it
made
me
smile
i
continued
to
drink
and
continued
to
grow
more
and
more
in
love
with
it
if
you
have
the
chance
and
the
money
to
buy
this
beer
do
not
pass
on
it
it
is
worth
the
search
and
the
cash
overall
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
ever
had
a
serving
size
of
only
330cl
leaves
you
wanting
another
bottle
at
in
de
vrede
it
pours
murky
dark
brown
with
a
thick
fluffy
beige
head
and
soft
carbonation
the
nose
is
caramel
toffee
fig
date
liquorice
menthol
and
salt
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
full
of
dark
fruit
fig
date
prune
and
plum
as
well
as
wood
caramel
vanilla
mint
bread
charcoal
toast
liquorice
toasted
sesame
and
coffee
with
a
very
long
roastedbitter
finish
it
tastes
fresh
complex
and
is
very
well
balanced
but
still
very
drinkable
it
deserves
its
place
at
the
top
dthis
is
a
very
tasty
beer
with
some
interesting
things
going
on
great
mouthfeel
but
a
little
boozy
in
the
taste
compared
to
what
i
had
expected
with
such
a
renowned
nectar
still
extremely
good
would
love
to
compare
it
with
a
fresh
example
o
i
cant
believe
it
but
i
think
i
might
like
the
8
more
than
the
12
awesome
maltcaramel
complexity
with
the
belgian
yeastbready
aspect
again
one
of
the
top
five
beers
i
have
ever
had
a
treat
to
try
and
i
consider
myself
extremely
lucky
to
have
some
great
beer
buddies
and
the
chance
to
have
tried
this
o
an
absolute
treat
for
sure
im
quite
surprised
just
how
much
more
depth
there
is
to
the
taste
than
the
nose
lets
on
i
was
expecting
a
grapephenol
bomb
but
was
absolutely
blown
away
by
the
malt
depth
balance
and
smoothness
this
is
one
of
the
best
belgians
i
have
ever
had
and
would
greatly
recommend
the
westy
8
now
i
just
need
to
see
how
a
fresh
bottle
compares
to
this
matured
nearly
4
year
old
bottle
bottle
overall
this
is
hands
down
the
best
beer
that
has
ever
passed
through
these
delicious
lips
of
mine
if
i
could
only
drink
this
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
would
be
content
and
die
a
very
happy
man
perfection
in
a
glass
extremely
creamy
feel
medium
bodied
fine
carbonation
some
oxidation
notes
rather
bitter
and
oddly
metallic
some
nutty
malt
flavors
linger
bitter
walnut
and
grassy
herbs
taste
seems
a
bit
of
a
letdown
from
what
i
remember
years
ago
very
dry
and
attenuated
with
an
overt
alcohol
presence
probably
wont
seek
out
again
unless
its
known
to
be
very
fresh
o
one
of
the
best
dubbels
i
have
had
really
not
all
that
different
in
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
than
a
lot
of
quads
not
as
flavorful
or
as
much
mouthfeel
as
12
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
westvleteren
makes
3
very
excellent
beers
i
am
glad
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
all
3
o
an
astonishing
beer
ive
never
had
a
dubbel
that
can
even
compare
with
this
edit
enjoying
my
second
bottle
almost
a
year
later
the
smell
has
intensified
still
the
same
scents
only
theyre
stronger
and
work
together
better
the
taste
is
the
same
only
everything
has
meshed
along
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
making
more
of
an
appearance
its
without
question
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
o
disappointing
for
the
price
tag
but
must
be
tried
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
dubbels
so
i
wasnt
too
excited
to
drink
this
even
though
its
a
westvleteren
needless
to
say
it
blew
me
away
creamy
but
well
carbonated
leading
to
a
great
sipper
i
love
it
when
these
relatively
heavy
beers
are
carbonated
like
this
forces
you
to
enjoy
it
slowly
like
a
great
meal
top
notch
dubbel
which
sadly
is
mostly
unavailable
to
me
next
up
rochefort
8
and
st
bernardus
8
to
see
how
they
compare
hv
overall
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
belgian
dubbel
should
be
it
took
all
of
my
effort
to
not
devour
my
halfaglass
because
i
really
wanted
to
enjoy
this
is
it
worth
the
price
tag
probably
not
it
is
amazing
definitely
i
have
been
trying
to
track
one
down
for
a
while
and
when
it
if
offered
to
you
for
free
you
say
fyes
recommended
and
definitely
worth
tracking
down
as
long
as
you
dont
break
the
bank
or
trade
the
cellar
for
it
m
medium
boy
with
a
good

w
a
beautiful
two

fantastic
lacing
on
my

and
it
sticks
around
until
i
wash
the
glass
fantastic
for
the
style
nose
consists
of
caramel
raisin
figs
cinnamon
spice
other
fruits
and
yeast
super
complex
nose
and
constantly
improving
and
changing
by
the
time
this
beer
is
fully
warmed
the
nose
gets
bumped
from
a
4
5
to
a
5
the
taste
words
cant
describe
the
taste
its
constantly
changing
swirling
in
a
cauldron
of
awesomeness
the
profile
is
similar
to
the
nose
w
some
fresh
baked
bread
in
there
for
good
measure
i
cant
think
of
a
single
thing
to
improve
here
thus
the
perfect
score
feel
is
super
silky
and
smooth
with
different
amazing
things
happening
to
your
mouth
as
you
experience
this
brew
full
bodied
and
perfect
overall
i
was
blown
away
by
this
beer
major
props
to
ba
huhzubendah
for
sharing
it
w
me
cheers
found
this
at
a
bar
in
brugges
i
was
excited
to
try
it
it
poured
very
nicely
into
a
chalice
there
was
not
much
head
but
the
color
was
a
beautiful
brown
cloudy
with
particles
in
it
it
smelled
sweet
plum
sugar
and
faint
alcohol
the
taste
is
excellent
very
sweet
but
complex
fruit
and
sugar
with
slight
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
crisp
that
said
it
was
not
thin
i
actually
preferred
this
to
the
12
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
drinkability
very
nice
and
the
best
ive
tried
of
the
style
lots
going
on
in
here
and
it
all
works
well
together
glad
to
have
tried
this
o
a
very
good
beer
marked
with
its
trappist
seal
something
between
a
blue
chimay
and
a
rochefort
10
love
it
honoured
to
be
able
to
try
this
beer
great
o
12
and
6
were
fantastic
8
is
well
done
but
its
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
it
reminds
me
of
the
rochefort
lineup
unique
complex
and
deeelicious
o
hands
down
best
dubbel
out
there
that
i
have
had
glad
i
hauled
this
back
with
me
as
a
single
bottle
from
amsterdam
d
masterfully
crafted
and
delicious
i
really
doubt
ill
ever
taste
another
dubbel
this
good
obviously
not
the
easiest
beer
to
get
but
it
does
not
disappoint
nice
finish
nothing
gets
in
the
way
of
another
sip
superb
rich
deep
and
very
very
enjoyable
my
sweet
tooth
just
loves
this
i
thought
the
westmalle
dubbel
was
superb
but
this
knocks
socks
off
it
in
all
departments
a
wonderful
beer
from
start
to
finish
o
absolutely
world
class
i
think
what
pushed
my
rating
here
to
exceptional
was
just
how
unbelievably
drinkable
this
beer
is
go
find
it
just
shared
a
bottle
to
celebrate
a
friends
wifes
pregnancy
this
bottle
was
from
my
honeymoon
three
years
ago
so
it
had
a
good
amount
of
aging
it
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
smell
is
like
heaven
and
so
is
the
taste
i
just
wish
i
had
more
o
insanely
drinkable
delicious
balanced
phenomenal
a
fantastic
dubbel
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
drank
if
i
lived
in
belgium
id
have
these
in
the
fridge
nonstop
overall
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
dubbel
i
havent
had
many
that
didnt
leave
a
lot
of
banana
aftertaste
this
one
doesnt
and
thats
why
i
love
it
glad
i
have
2
more
saved
up
for
other
special
occasions
truly
an
amazing
beer
not
quite
as
funky
and
sour
as
westy
12
but
also
not
as
flavorful
drinkability
is
slightly
higher
but
quality
is
slightly
lower
im
wowed
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
deliberately
didnt
read
any
reviews
before
tasting
im
not
a
big
dubbel
drinker
but
this
one
is
definitely
worth
repeating
if
i
get
the
opportunity
overall
a
very
good
dubbel
but
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
expectations
which
were
admittedly
high
the
cherry
notes
were
very
pleasant
and
everything
blended
together
quite
nicely

even
though
this
is

a
favorite
style
of
mine
in
general
these
guys
know
what
they
are
doing
just
dont
ask
me
how
o
a
very
good
double
very
good
indeed
it
just
gets
better
after
each
gulp
you
take
d
very
drinkable
a
bit
sweet
and
pruny
but
dry
ale
yeast
and
peppery
notes
balance
it
out
o
word
class
one
of
the
more
pleasent
beer
experiences
ive
had
so
drinkable
worth
the
reputation
o
i
was
expecting
a
lot
here
and
thought
it
would
disappoint
it
did
the
opposite
this
is
a
delicious
dubbel
the
best
of

have
had

comments
one
of
the
best
prey
ive
catched
in
my
more
than
35
years
as
a
beer
hunter
pairingnothing
at
all
an
amazing
experience
should
not
be
cloudy
by
anything
nevertheless
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
more
than
one
of
this
fresh
bread
rolls
banana
will
match
pretty
well
o
absolutely
delicious
dubbel
easily
the
best
that
i
have
had
to
date
really
drinkable
for
8
abv
and
every
sip
is
packed
with
tons
of
flavor
wish
i
had
another
one
hallelujah
obest
dubbel
ive
ever
had
hands
down
as
i
see
it
this
is
the
one
to
beat
good
luck
with
that
thanks
caseyk
for
a
chance
at
this
one
bottle
is
from
1985
and
cap
says
extra
8
on
it
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
reddishorangey
tint
to
it
with
a
very
slight
head
nose
is
a
nice
collection
of
dark
fruit
and
caramel
breadiness
including
big
plum
the
taste
is
fantastic
a
lot
of
plum
pear
prune
with
a
bit
of
breadiness
crazy
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
light
carbonation
with
a
pretty
light
body
we
speculated
whether
this
was
brewed
with
plum
puree
this
dubbel
held
up
with
no
problem
at
all
and
just
blew
us
away
the
only
problem
was
that
i
only
had
a
few
ozs
would
love
another
to
compare
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
my
experience
the
westy
12
wasnt
worth
the
effort
relative
to
other
quads
still
good
though
this
beer
granted
it
has
a
ton
of
age
was
totally
worth
the
effort
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
finger
or
two
of
foam
in
the
maredsous
chalice
glass
tastes
of
breadybiscuit
like
malts
with
a
slight
dark
fruit
finish
to
it
the
8
is
masked
very
well
and
it
drinks
down
very
smooth
would
be
nice
if
westvleteren
beers
were
more
accessable
this
is
an
incredible
beer
i
have
one
stored
away
for
a
good
day
and
i
cant
wait
to
drink
it
with
a
little
age
on
it
toasty
deep
sweetbread
with
a
zesty
yeast
bite
not
hoppy
but
has
a
drying
effect
similar
to
a
spiced
winter
warmer
a
unique
bready
belgian
beer
that
i
would
happily
buy
again
were
it
more
readily
available
the
questability
and
rarity
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
for
me
though
to
actively
seek
out
thanks
again
dan
i
really
enjoyed
it
mouthfeeloverall
light
mouthfeel
but
the
carbonation
is
so
fine
and
so
abundant
that
it
results
in
a
pillowy
mouthfeel
very
nice
overall
like
i
said
the
far
and
away
the
best
dubbel
i
have
ever
had
many
dubbels
come
across
as
yeast
and
wet
cardboard
to
me
but
this
beer
does
much
more
than
that
extremely
impressive
32511
bottle
courtesy
joes
hazy
deep
brown
pour
with
a
small
fizzy
tan
head
thats
gone
fast
malty
aroma
with
yeast
caramel
and
a
hint
of
mint
reminds
of
me
of
a
ligher
version
of
12
grapey
yeasty
smooth
caramel
and
loveliness
you
can
tell
that
these
beers
are
very
well
made
nice
sublime
im
not
going
to
make
any
bold
statements
about
this
beers
status
as
the
best
ever
i
havent
opened
the
12
yet
but
rest
assured
this
brew
is
certainly
worthy
of
the
hype
and
is
certainly
amongst
the
very
best
brews
the
world
can
offer
worth
navigating
the
tricky
ordering
process
or
better
yet
a
fortuitous
trade
truly
fantastic
stuff
and
i
really
wish
i
had
more
of
this
another
cracking
belgian
from
the
little
masters
and
another
beer
worthy
of
seeking
out
i
was
thoughtful
i
might
like
this
even
better
than
the
12
being
as
though
the
dubbel
is
a
particular
favourite
of
mine
but
theres
no
doubting
the
superiority
of
the
quad
this
was
a
stellar
beer
the
12
was
phenomenal
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
and
silky
smooth
this
was
a
real
treat
picked
up
in
an
early
trade
with
alldaydrinker
i
would
rate
this
slightly
higher
than
the
westy
12
a
fantastic
beer
best
dubbel
to
date
no
surprise
its
a
westy
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
im
not
sure
if
ill
continue
to
dish
out
the
high
dollars
for
it
though
i
know
of
one
competitor
that
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
and
i
can
purchase
it
right
off
the
shelf
still
a
pleasure
to
have
jd
thanks
to
jason
for
bringin
this
along
with
a
westy
12
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
medium
tanwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
scent
is
full
of
dark
fruit
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
apple
aroma
not
nearly
as
much
going
on
as
the
12
has
taste
initially
a
tart
green
apple
flavor
which
is
immediately
followed
with
a
lot
of
lovely
chocolate
flavors
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
as
well
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
possibly
one
of
the
most
dry
dubbels
ive
had
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
dubble
ive
ever
had
i
do
enjoy
the
quads
and
tripels
more
but
this
is
great
for
what
it
is
very
tasty
beer
o
not
the
worst
dubbel
ive
had
where
it
disappoints
is
in
the
wrong
places
malty
candi
sugar
and
light
citrus
hops
raisins
bread
and
caramel
a
light
alcohol
burn
mild
carbonation
a
nice
sipper
a
very
enjoyable
beer
even
with
the
alcohol
burn
pours
dark
brown
with
some
sediment
the
offwhite
head
has
great
retention
leaves
a
little
lacing
very
fruity
aroma
with
pears
apples
dark
fruits
candi
sugar
and
spices
smells
really
nice
tastes
of
dark
fruit
malt
spices
and
earthy
hops
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
perfect
slightly
dry
overall
its
a
wonderful
beer
probably
the
best
dubbel
ive
tried
still
its
much
better
than
westvleteren
12
cheers
overall
if
it
was
more
readily
accessible
i
would
drink
this
fine
beer
daily
if
you
have
a
chance
to
buy
it
do
it
dr
ill
pound
it
all
night
like
its
megan
fox
not
as
good
as
the
12
but
still
an
amazing
beer
i
think
too
often
this
beer
gets
compared
with
the
12
unfavorably
which
is
so
difficult
to
avoid
taken
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
12
its
a
magnificent
beer
in
its
own
right
this
beer
can
almost
have
a
tendency
to
feel
like
its
a
step
on
the
staircase
towards
the
12
but
it
ought
to
be
considered
outside
this
context
as
in
terms
of
the
dubbel
style
its
hard
to
do
better
an
amazing
beer
all
things
considered
very
affordable
when
purchased
at
the
abbey
and
not
from
the
douchenozzle
ebayers
obviously
its
availability
is
a
constraining
factor
o
complex
and
delicious
beer
all
the
wy
around
world
class
and
phenom
dubbel
excellent
dubbel
probably
the
best
ive
ever
had
o
i
have
severely
underestimated
westvleteren
and
i
will
be
sure
to
seek
out
as
much
of
this
as
possible
this
one
is
definitely
the
benchmark
that
i
will
be
comparing
all
dubbels
to
until
something
else
blows
me
away
of
course
od
good
beer
nice
dark
fruit
flavour
mixed
with
other
well
represented
elements
i
think
this
is
the
weakest
of
the
westvleteren
beers
with
the
blonde
being
my
second
favourite
but
this
was
still
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
and
like
all
the
other
westy
beers
so
smooth
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
3
before
you
notice
you
finished
1
definitely
my
least
favorite
of
the
westy
bunch
thanks
to
my
gf
westys
for
my
bday
bottle
opens
and
a
slight
gush
occurs
pours
reddish
brown
with
an
auditory
tan
head
and
a
shade
of
lacing
an
island
of
foam
remains
atop
throughout
strong
aroma
of
raisin
dates
and
caramalized
candi
sugar
a
little
spice
on
the
nose
as
well
chewy
dark
candi
sugar
big
cara
malts
and
dark
fruity
flavors
somewhats
vinous
nice
estery
yeast
flavors
really
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
little
bit
of
nutty
quality
dryer
mouthfeel
than
anticipated
but
some
flavor
sticking
around
well
this
certainly
lives
up
to
the
hype
well
done
o
another
mind
blowing
beer
from
westvleteren
overall
only
downside
was
price
worth
it
for
the
experience
overall
juset
a
superb
beer
i
cannot
overstate
how
satisfied
ive
been
with
the
westvleteren
experience
tonight
i
know
overhyping
something
is
the
best
way
to
ruin
it
but
as
long
as
you
come
to
this
beer
with
the
proper
mindset
youre
sure
to
enjoy
them
id
started
righting
a
negative
review
beer
was
too
cold
school
girl
error
although
it
wasnt
really
that
cold
this
if
far
better
at
around
15
degrees
c
i
think
i
enjoyed
this
more
drinking
in
big
chewy
mouthfulls
rather
than
dainty
sips
as
well
d
drinkability
is
high
the
nose
is
a
little
underwhelming
but
the
taste
more
than
compensates
its
a
great
dubbel
but
not
as
much
as
a
standout
as
the
westvleteren
12
is
for
the
quad
category
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
get
the
chance
to
try
it
do
not
pass
it
up
a
true
world
class
belgian
worthy
of
its
reputation
such
a
great
beer
so
full
of
flavor
that
it
leaves
me
a
little
speechless
i
would
definitely
pay
another
30
for
it
again
highly
recommend
o
i
ca
see
why
people
prefer
this
over
its
big
brother
because
its
even
more
gentle
and
almost
as
complex
its
just
so
damn
smooth
and
like
the
12
takes
you
on
a
journey
of
flavours
drinkability
and
overall
impression
one
word
to
help
understand
this
beer
is
complex
another
is
smooth
the
drinkability
is
great
here
i
could
sip
on
this
one
all
night
and
would
hope
someday
to
have
more
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
beer
deserves
its
reputation
as
a
wellmade
dubbel
and
that
it
sets
the
bar
to
such
a
height
that
others
may
aspire
but
dont
really
achieve
o
a
very
unique
but
very
good
dubbel
wish
it
was
more
available
though
o
great
stuff
that
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
love
all
so
rich
and
powerful
but
still
so
delicate
this
is
a
beer
that
nears
perfection
overall
i
like
and
see
why
this
brewery
is
known
for
their
complex
beers
i
hope
i
get
to
try
the
12
next
time
pours
a
dark
murky
reddish
brown
not
much
head
at
all
aromas
of
dried
fruits
brown
sugar
caramel
flavor
follows
with
raisins
dates
sweet
port
and
lots
of
other
delicious
notes
each
sip
brings
all
of
these
to
the
front
of
your
tastebuds
its
also
a
very
light
and
crisp
dubbel
very
drinkible
while
not
quite
as
good
as
the
westy
12
still
an
outstanding
beer
the
cpj
excellent
beer
i
hate
comparing
but
this
is
much
better
than
the
blonde
pretty
damn
close
to
being
as
good
as
the
12
fruity
light
drinkable
different
enough
from
your
runothemill
dubbel
to
put
it
at
the
head
of
the
class
i
can
see
why
this
is
highly
sought
after
an
excellent
beer
subtle
and
complex
but
overall
flavor
did
not
jump
out
as
exceptional
enough
to
justify
the
ranking
to
me
i
am
new
to
the
belgian
beer
scene
but
personally
i
prefer
to
buy
one
of
the
good
north
american
made
belgian
style
beers
over
this
overall
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
trappist
beers
ive
had
its
well
balanced
but
much
hoppier
than
any
belgian
beerin
this
style
that
i
have
encountered
the
malt
and
dark
fruit
notes
really
start
to
shine
as
it
warms
so
i
highly
recommend
drinking
it
at
cellar
temperature
or
letting
it
warm
up
considerably
to
enjoy
it
at
its
fullest
potential
not
as
complex
flavorful
or
easy
to
drink
as
the
12
but
its
still
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
and
very
unique
it
tasted
much
fruitier
and
light
than
i
expected
i
really
appreciate
my
friend
for
sharing
part
of
a
bottle
with
me
truly
a
great
beer
drinking
experience
and
i
hope
to
get
some
for
myself
in
the
future
md
this
beer
was
pretty
light
on
carbonation
but
was
still
really
smooth
as
it
finished
poured
a
dark
maroon
opaque
with
a
finger
or
two
of
offwhite
head
nose
of
sharp
alcohol
initially
but
then
some
raisin
ripe
green
apple
skin
ripe
plums
and
some
date
appears
taste
kicks
off
with
a
quick
glimpse
of
the
alcohol
on
the
palate
mixed
with
some
stone
fruits
light
apple
comes
through
again
hints
of
brown
sugar
vanilla
alcohol
present
and
prevalent
throughout
each
sip
but
only
adds
to
the
complexity
of
this
light
tannic
finish
warming
mouthfeel
great
body
with
a
finish
that
lingers
forever
solid
drinkability
and
an
exceptional
beer
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
i
recieved
this
in
a
recent
trade
poured
into
a
goblet
from
an
11
2
ounce
bottle
pours
a
murky
brown
huge
4
finger
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
dark
fruit
is
primary
on
the
nose
some
spices
the
flavors
of
plums
dates
and
apples
meld
very
nicely
not
overly
sweet
the
beer
is
very
smooth
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
finish
the
body
is
medium
smooth
well
carbonated
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
i
can
see
why
it
is
a
classic
big
thanks
to
brad
amazingly
a
darker
pour
than
the
12
really
deep
brown
a
creamy
beige
head
aroma
of
prunes
figs
some
maple
syrup
not
really
a
massive
burst
of
fruits
and
sugars
like
the
12
flavor
has
that
really
rich
elegant
clean
alcohol
sugar
purity
fresh
and
exciting
there
are
a
lot
of
figs
and
a
slight
bittering
component
of
hops
on
the
back
end
that
isnt
necessarily
welcome
here
a
little
too
much
carbonation
but
still
creamy
and
smooth
overripe
bananas
play
a
role
as
the
beer
warms
the
comparisons
to
the
12
are
inevitable
this
is
less
of
everything
but
still
delicious
the
feel
is
moderate
and
spritzy
again
great
balance
sweet
on
the
palate
as
most
belgians
are
but
the
earthy
characteristics
keep
everything
in
check
abv
well
hidden
had
this
part
of
a
westvleteren
taster
at
volo
in
toronto
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
finger
of
white
head
really
nice
head
retention
i
had
this
after
the
taster
of
the
westy
blonde
and
the
head
was
still
there
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
plum
and
cherry
with
brown
sugar
and
candy
sugar
alcohol
is
a
little
bit
noticeable
in
the
flavour
quite
sweet
flavour
very
nice
very
nice
mouthfeel
i
think
this
is
easily
the
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
o
home
run
hands
down
best
double
ive
had
sorry
westmalle
it
has
all
the
awesome
grain
character
you
want
plus
even
more
amazing
things
happening
its
just
plain
delicious
this
beer
makes
me
wish
they
distributed
so
much
more
than
i
did
before
pours
mahogany
with
ruby
orange
and
brown
showing
up
in
the
light
nice
lace
on
the
glass
tight
white
to
off
white
head
smells
of
alcohol
burnt
sugar
dark
cherry
apple
caramel
raisin
dark
fruit
toffee
the
nose
on
this
is
extremely
complex
and
inviting
taste
is
dark
fruit
raisin
candy
like
sugar
apple
a
very
pronounced
sharp
warming
alcohol
is
present
upfront
that
pushes
this
along
but
isnt
overpowering
and
a
tannic
presence
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
solid
with
a
great
weight
and
a
subtle
but
present
carbonation
very
solid
drinks
really
well
starts
off
as
a
slow
sipper
but
as
it
opens
up
and
warms
it
drinks
much
quicker
truly
excellent
stuff
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
viscous
but
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
style
and
there
is
a
pleasant
dryness
westy
beers
seem
a
bit
more
attenuated
than
some
of
the
other
trappists
and
this
definitely
helps
drinkability
pours
a

with

little
bit
of
everything
in
the
aftertaste
it
might
be
the
most
complex
thing
i
have
ever
had
drinkability
is
very
good
the
flavors
were
great
and
it
had
some
nice
depth
and
complexity
the
dark
fruit
flavors
really
stood
out
and
added
some
very
pleasant
sweetness
very
nice
beer
overall
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
bottle
was
bought
in
brussels
about
a
year
ago
and
kept
in
my
cellar
beautiful
deep
brown
pulled
back
on
the
pour
for
clarity
my
preference
wonderful
sweet
smell
thats
hard
to
pin
down
its
just
awesome
tasted
slightly
sweet
with
full
flavor
mix
of
perfectly
combined
malt
and
yeast
again
very
hard
to
describe
accurately
without
going
too
far
down
any
one
road
plum
notes
show
up
in
the
flavor
but
dont
linger
too
long
very
nice
going
down
in
fullflavored
swallows
if
theres
a
downside
here
which
is
hard
to
find
it
might
be
too
sweet
to
drink
all
night
d
the
feel
of
this
one
makes
it
highly
drinkable
a
little
warm
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
limits
it
slightly
smell
was
fantastic
with
the
taste
only
leaving
me
wanting
slightly
more
but
i
guess
that
would
be
a
style
preference
d
pretty
good
drinkability
but
a
lot
less
interesting
than
the
12
it
was
nice
to
try
this
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again

as
well
the
taste
is
actually
a
little
more
subdued
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
carbonation
seems
a
little
high
for
me
as
well
and
detracts
from
the
flavors
overall
im
just
ok
on
this
beer
it
isnt
exactly
what
i
thought
it
would
be
and
isnt
as
good
as
i
wanted
skal
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
hope
to
have
this
again
poured
a
very
nice
pecan
brown
soft
hues
of
autumn
in
the
light
topped
with
an
offwhite
head
that
gave
wonderful
lacing
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
the
most
esteemed
belgian
brewerymonastery
in
the
world
lovely
caramel
of
a
darker
type
along
with
figs
and
bread
extremely
well
made
offering
caramel
touch
of
sweet
chocolate
dates
figs
and
yeast
no
alcohol
is
detected
at
all
well
carbonated
as
it
should
be
and
quite
smooth
maybe
too
smooth
in
fact
because
i
cant
seem
to
stop
pouring
more
samples
for
myself
this
is
a
great
dubbel
that
i
am
lucky
to
be
enjoying
on
my
bday
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
and
the
beer
is
so
delectable
and
smooth
that
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
bottles
werent
so
hard
to
get
ahold
of
this
is
not
just
a
good
tasting
beer
but
it
produces
a
warm
fuzzy
bodily
feeling
that
is
unusually
pleasant
as
well
this
beer
is
an
excellent
complement
to
its
better
known
brother
and
an
excellent
beer
all
around
once
more
deserving
of
its
reputation
quite
nice
i
would
compare
this
favorably
to
the
other
big
name
dubbels
mainly
on
the
strength
of
better
balance
and
less
sweetness
in
the
flavor
in
addition
to
an
excellent
mouthfeel
largely
due
to
more
active
carbonation
and
a
lack
of
cloying
sticky
sweetness
high
in
subtlety
and
a
great
mouthfeel
i
had
a
bottle
of
maredsous
8
yesterday
and
this
restores
my
faith
in
the
style
i
just
want
to
leave
this
in
my
mouth
and
swirl
it
around
for
a
while
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
one
that
i
dont
think
quite
lives
up
to
the
hype
westy
12
is
a
flatout
excellent
beer
but
i
worry
that
the
8
is
kinda
riding
the
coattails
of
its
big
brother
its
a
good
beer
but
not
one
thats
worthy
of
being
in
the
top
10
beers
in
the
world
if
you
ask
me
di
could
pound
these
puppies
but
i
am
also
excited
to
see
this
one
aged
for
a
few
years
to
see
if
it
becomes
more
complex
as
the
heat
dies
down
a
bit

abv
tasted
on
selfproclaimed
westy
day
010611
with
my
beer
aficionado
buddy
this
wonderful
dubbel
trappist
beer
was
bottled
in
2010
with
date
stamped
15
01
13
on
cap
after
pouring
the
beer
gave
off
a
cloudy
brownbronze
appearance
left
a
very
nice
foamy
head
the
smell
was
initially
subdued
probably
because
it
was
too
cold
then
the
flavors
started
coming
out
when
above
room
temperature
with
the
love
the
st
sixtus
monks
put
in
this
beer
this
is
a
definitely
complex
and
mysterious
beer
one
i
truly
embraced
it
gave
off
a
bitter
mouthability
then
soothed
out
at
the
end
this
smooth
taste
consisted
of
caramel
sweet
malts
subdued
raisins
belgian
candy
sugar
the
westy
8
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
and
one
that
i
will
gladly
drink
any
day
if
you
get
one
youll
be
happy
but
dont
pay
100
for
one
unless
you
are
rich
cant
wait
to
try
one
of
the
12s
i
always
wondered
if
it
would
live
up
to
the
hype
and
indeed
it
did
and
more
the
impression
i
was
left
with
was
the
unbelievable
robustness
and
complexity
yet
perfectly
balanced
and
smooth
so
does
it
live
up
to
the
hype
im
not
sure
but
it
is
a
great
beer
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
this
one
shows
that
you
dont
have
to
be
over
the
top
with
abv
or
ibu
to
be
world
class
very
understated
and
solid
in
every
aspect
i
would
put
it
at
the
top
of
the
style
id
take
one
of
these
any
time
i
get
the
chance
hopefully
some
day
ill
get
to
taste
it
at
the
source

the

pours
a
muddy
plum
color
with
a
hazy
clarity
head
was
a
rocky
and
creamcolored
and
half
an
inch
in
height
a
couple
large
swaths
and
a
few
residual
spots
of
lacing
adhered
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
during
the
tasting
head
was
refreshed
with
a
swirl
big
yeasty
nose
with
a
figs
prunes
and
a
bready
quality
following
behind
taste
follows
nose
completely
style
consistent
but
a
bit
dull
theres
also
a
slightly
herbalchemical
character
present
probably
attributable
to
the
yeast
strain
the
mouthfeel
kills
this
beer
for
me
carbonation
is
very
aggressive
and
the
burn
lingers
between
quaffs
consistency
is
lightmedium
but
closer
to
light
and
finish
is
semidry
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
perhaps
it
could
stand
some
aging
and
i
will
definitely
procure
another
bottle
if
the
opportunity
presents
however
the
carbonation
completed
detracted
from
the
experience
it
did
improve
slightly
by
gently
swirling
the
glass
to
dissipate
the
gas
making
it
an
almost
pleasant
sipper
however
i
suspect
it
might
be
too
young
d
too
smooth
very
easy
drinking
didnt
leave
the
lasting
impression
of
westy
12
but
definitely
not
a
disappointment
at
all
much
thanks
thjis
one
word
awesome
this
was
an
extremely
difficult
bottle
to
pour
there
were
lees
evident
along
the
sides
of
the
bottle
as
well
as
in
the
kick
my
gentle
pour
created
only
wisps
along
the
center
of
the
beer
color
was
a
deep
amber
almost
brown
and
with
nequality
clarity
in
the
first
glass
of
two
that
was
poured
the
second
glass
picked
up
some
of
the
less
despite
my
best
efforts
to
avoid
it
i
did
my
best
to
warm
it
from
the
refrigerator
to
get
the
nose
to
come
forward
the
first
thing
that
i
got
were
notes
of
dark
dried
fruit
raisins
plums
and
cherries
caramelbutterscotch
and
and
earthy
birch
beercola
scent
wow
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
with
a
minty
quality
to
accompany
the
hazelnutastringentdrying
taste
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
extremely
dry
leaving
me
literally
gasping
the
glass
with
the
lees
was
also
passed
around
and
that
had
a
quality
of
oily
sludge
with
a
taste
of
bitter
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
with
the
glass
nearly
empty
we
combined
the
lees
and
the
clarified
pour
for
another
different
taste
that
seemed
to
combine
all
of
the
flavors
previously
noted
zounds
d
the
booze
was
in
there
somewhere
but
i
certainly
couldnt
find
it
i
see
the
appeal
of
this
brew
and
am
a
true
believer
in
it
dm
crisp
and
good
weighted
beer
these
beers
always
give
me
the
sense
of
a
church
like
drinking
a
pew
or
something
not
bad
a
all
really
great
present
to
get
westy
8
is
balanced
and
subtle
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
the
way
the
12
did
but
it
deserves
its
reputation
understated
and
elegant
a
wonderfully
crafted
belgian
ale
with
lots
of
character
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
is
just
really
good
what
i
really
like
is
that
i
get
lots
of
the
notes
i
love
in
flanders
reds
in
this
without
the
sourness
which
makes
it
like
a
great
blend
of
flanders
and
dubbel
drinkability
is
killer
i
drank
my
half
of
the
bottle
in
around
ten
minutes
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
overt
complexity
but
that
was
mere
foolishness
and
this
was
a
bit
of
a
welldeserved
slap
in
the
face
masterfully
balanced
and
nuanced
a
reminder
of
what
beer
can
and
should
be
d
excellent
the
dry
and
clean
finish
make
this
beer
super
easy
to
put
down
tasty
and
satisfying
d
wonderful
wonderful
beer
i
would
have
to
concur
that
this
could
possibly
be
the
best
for
its
style
8
is
however
not
quite
as
decadent
as
the
12
hardly
anything
is
even
from
the
same
brewery
again
i
cannot
thank
you
enough
ipa247
for
letting
me
try
this
brew
this
is
a
highly
carbonated
offering
that
somewhat
exaggerates
the
alcohol
with
a
sort
of
evaporative
quality
when
it
hits
the
tongue
it
is
medium
bodied
super
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
have
only
had
this
brew
on
one
other
occasion
and
that
experience
was
better
than
this
one
perhaps
it
was
a
bottle
with
a
little
bit
of
age
on
it
regardless
a
fantastic
brew
overall
the
newer
beer
is
good
but
the
aged
beer
is
spectacular
put
this
one
on
your
shelf
for
a
year
or
two
and
taste
the
difference
older
beers
will
loose
a
lot
of
the
hoppy
tanginess
of
the
younger
beers
but
instead
develop
an
enveloping
raisiny
richness
overall
im
starting
to
believe
that
trappist
monks
are
proof
of
god
existing
seriously
this
beer
was
a
joy
to
drink
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
im
sad
now
that
my
glass
is
empty
i
want
more
oh
god
do
i
want
more
d
and
notes
ive
heard
from
many
people
that
this
is
better
than
the
12
i
dont
quite
agree
but
it
was
a
great
pair
with
the
pate
and
the
abbey
cheese
very
drinkable
for
the
strength
as
well
most
grateful
indeed
a
sacred
brew
worthy
of
sacred
appreciation
given
this
rare
opportunity
i
gotta
thank
matt
for
cracking
this
one
i
know
you
were
saving
it
for
some
time
now
overall
i
cant
wait
to
try
a
12
this
one
was
close
to
a
5
in
one
or
two
departments
if
a
4
75
was
a
option
it
would
have
been
dropped
here
d
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
pair
it
with
some
creamy
and
pungent
cheese
a
must
with
this
one
and
youll
experience
a
flavorgasm
this
beer
is
quite
deserving
of
the
respect
it
receives
and
it
a
stellar
example
of
the
style
cheers
to
the
st
sixtus
brothers
for
this
masterpiece
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
amazing
dubbel
i
thought
it
looked
and
smelled
amazing
and
the
mouthfeel
was
perfect
while
i
think
the
taste
was
very
enjoyable
it
was
probably
the
weakest
part
of
this
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
little
less
alcohol
in
the
taste
that
being
said
the
taste
is
still
great
its
just
that
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
are
pretty
much
perfect
would
love
to
get
some
more
of
this
wasnt
that
impressed
and
imho
this
one
is
more
undeservedly
hyped
than
the
12
my
friend
loves
this
one
prefers
it
over
the
12
but
i
dont
find
it
nearly
as
complex
full
sweet
and
creamy
as
the
12
but
to
each
his
own
dark
fruit
a
bit
on
the
light
side
and
a
bit
too
much
of
an
alcohol
taste
dont
get
me
wrong
it
was
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
then
again
it
was
a
fresh
one
if
i
can
age
a
couple
of
bottles
maybe
i
can
upgrade
this
one
found
this
on
a
shelf
in
a
beer
store
in
brussels
like
the
12
i
found
this
was
also
10
euro
and
i
had
to
but
it
i
know
about
the
monks
and
all
but
if
it
is
for
sale
and
i
cant
get
to
them
i
would
snatch
this
up
in
a
hurry
quite
good
and
tasty
but
not
blowing
my
mind
like
i
was
hoping
i
really
liked
it
but
maybe
because
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
it
did
not
seem
as
good
how
do
you
even
judge
this
its
like
an
orgasm
in
liquid
form
a
truly
exceptional
amazing
beer
hands
down
one
of
the
most
delicately
crafted
beers
ive
ever
had
just
shy
of
perfection
due
to
slight
booze
an
absolute
knockout
im
already
looking
forward
to
the
rematch
drinkability
while
the
booze
does
limit
the
drinkability
it
is
still
a
very
smooth
brew
i
have
two
more
bottles
of
westvleteren
8
that
ill
try
to
keep
and
age
until
its
best
by
date
and
try
one
in
a
12
years
and
one
in
3
years
looking
forward
to
it
it
has
a
brown
hue
like
caramel
and
is
translucent
there
is
a
good
tan
bubbly
head
i
can
smell
caramel
plums
brown
and
crystal
sugars
the
flavor
has
notes
of
a
fine
chocolate
but
also
some
plum
and
other
dark
fruits
the
yeast
imparts
an
interesting
aspect
that
is
hard
to
summarize
from
my
pour
i
have
a
bottle
of
this
in
my
cellar
that
i
hope
will
help
me
expand
this
review
overall
the
taste
is
sweet
and
effervescent
the
sweetness
lingers
it
has
a
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
the
coat
isnt
very
big
which
i
found
slightly
surprising
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
having
a
bottle
or
two
in
a
session
would
be
perfect
d
wow
this
is
perfection
in
a
bottle
i
prefer
this
to
the
12
as
its
more
drinkable
its
not
so
much
the
sipper
that
12
is
thus
i
have
to
score
this
higher
in
my
book
i
would
love
to
sit
down
with
a
few
bottles
around
a
fire
pit
on
a
cool
winter
evening
eh
maybe
someday
thanks
to
don
for
bringing
this
one
to
an
epic
tasting
poured
into
a
generic
tulip
nice
off
white
head
moderate
retention
ruby
body
aroma
of
dark
over
ripe
pitted
fruits
taste
is
raisins
brown
sugar
and
liquid
gold
greatness
everything
expected
and
a
little
more
smooth
as
can
be
with
no
abv
noted
perfection
d
without
a
doubt
would
drink
it
again
makes
me
want
to
try
a
fresh
one
bottle
marked
200910
pours
with
a
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
sticks
over
a
deep
hazy
amber
brown
body
great
lace
aroma
is
banana
licorice
light
alcohol
plums
yeast
dried
fruits
and
candi
sugar
a
bit
on
the
non
assertive
side
taste
is
rum
dark
fruits
plum
and
a
touch
of
wheat
water
like
consistency
light
bubbles
very
good
albeit
understated
beer
nothing
special
but
enjoyable
in
their
cafe
on
a
sunny
day
thanks
thijs
for
letting
me
get
this
great
beer
after
waiting
for
a
few
weeks
i
finally
decided
to
crack
this
open
served
into
a
wine
glass
since
i
just
moved
and
had
my
specialty
glasses
in
boxes
ohh
lots
of
head
creamy
and
rich
hints
of
caramel
but
not
too
sweet
perfection
on
this
style
overall
this
is
really
a
great
beer
glad
i
finally
got
the
chance
to
try
it
i
will
certainly
seek
it
out
again
in
the
future
thanks
thijs
a
real
treat
dexcellent
beer
not
as
heavy
as
12
still
has
complexity
and
far
from
a
disappointment
after
having
12
if
i
have
the
honor
of
drinking
this
again
i
will
d
very
complex
and
apparent
smells
and
flavours
stand
out
well
you
dont
have
to
go
looking
for
them
at
all
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
with
a
smoothness
that
gives
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
not
had
fresh
but
those
11
years
did
not
do
any
harm
clear
deep
burgandy
tone
nicely
whipped
head
of
light
beige
froth
adorns
the
surface
and
has
great
retention
and
lacing
ability
initial
blast
of
alcohol
on
the
nostrils
subsides
as
the
sweet
bubblegum
and
rock
candy
notes
take
over
theres
also
a
raisiny
rummy
characteristic
on
the
nose
very
nice
aroma
the
flavors
are
complex
yet
subdued
a
graceful
profile
of
dates
figs
plums
raisins
bubblegum
rum
toffee
and
chocolate
a
spicy
alcoholic
bitterness
resides
on
the
tongue
after
the
swallow
and
detracts
just
a
little
from
the
overall
drinking
experience
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
it
almost
melts
in
the
mouth
like
cotton
candy
carbonation
is
appropriate
good
dubbel
notes
i
usually
dont
like
dubbels
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
one
out
there
it
has
to
be
seriously
complex
but
doesnt
demand
your
full
attention
and
has
a
nice
balance
between
bitterness
and
sweetcreaminess
it
smells
of
fruits
and
spices
with
a
bit
of
grains
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
shines
it
hits
you
with
a
sweet
sugar
taste
right
at
the
beginning
then
followed
quickly
by
the
fruit
it
almost
taste
like
a
grape
juice
for
the
first
split
second
then
it
turns
grainy
and
that
beer
flavor
that
is
so
important
to
a
good
beer
is
there
the
thing
that
is
odd
for
me
about
this
beer
is
just
as
fast
as
all
these
flavors
hit
your
pallet
they
are
gone
again
this
beer
had
almost
no
after
taste
at
all
an
oddity
for
a
beer
of
this
complexity
pours
a
molasses
murky
brown
into
a
westvleteren
chalice
big
creamy
frothy
head
is
present
and
recedes
into
a
small
layer
of
thin
bubbles
smell
is
sugary
and
soapy
with
golden
raisin
and
dark
wheat
bread
present
taste
is
filled
with
notes
of
darkfruits
bready
and
its
slightly
smoky
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
a
carbonated
fizz
at
the
end
its
really
nice
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
wont
because
id
be
feeling
like
crap
cause
i
drank
them
all
so
soon
my
favorite
dubbel
ever
notes
best
before
300912
very
good
beer
and
right
at
the
same
level
as
the
12
very
complex
malty
beer
very
easy
to
drink
if
only
it
was
easier
to
get
overall
despite
the
hype
that
the
12
gets
the
8
holds
its
own
as
one
of
the
betterbest
dubbels
out
there
my
distaste
for
high
carbonation
aside
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
thanks
again
jeffrey
as
i
said
this
really
has
redefined
the
style
for
me
one
thing
that
normally
bugs
me
about
dubbels
is
some
feel
really
thin
in
the
mouth
where
this
really
fills
it
up
and
is
solid
through
the
sip
one
thing
that
hurt
the
beer
just
a
tad
is
the
amount
of
carbonation
just
a
little
too
much
as
this
beer
was
very
fresh
i
have
another
one
in
my
cellar
so
i
am
anxious
to
see
how
it
turns
out
if
it
is
anything
near
the
3
year
old
westy
12
i
had
i
am
in
for
a
treat
d
i
could
and
would
drink
this
beer
very
regularly
if
only
that
were
possible
this
is
a
truly
special
beer
and
absolutely
worthy
of
any
and
all
praises
big
thanks
to
billinlafayette

this
one

on

served
from
bottle
into
a
mcchouffe
goblet
pours
a
dark
brown
with
one
finger
off
white
head
that
contains
a
dusting
of
brown
sediment
on
the
top
maintains
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
mat
fruit
alcohol
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
of
big
fruit
alcohol
malt
and
a
smooth
creamy
followthrough
it
is
medium
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
is
phenomenal
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
good
but
wow
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
brew
is
beautiful
definitely
the
best
of
this
style
i
have
had
to
date
believe
the
hype
people
d
super
solid
belgian
with
incredible
balance
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
this
one
is
very
drinkable
with
a
feel
that
is
smooth
and
really
serves
to
both
meld
and
separate
the
complexities
of
this
beer
worth
the
trouble
without
a
doubt
m
d
very
nice
crisp
and
dry
great
fluffy
mouthfeel
with
almost
perfect
co2
content
good
full
body
with
great
overall
flavors
i
would
drink
this
all
day
everyday
even
with
the
abv
best
estimate
is
that
this
is
a
sweeter
version
of
a
westmalle
double
undated
bottle
assumed
to
be
brewed
in
09
had
at
cafe
gollem
in
midmay
d
wonderful
d
wow
very
awesome
i
think
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
upper
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
warming
an
enjoyable
dubbel
i
find
westy
8
to
be
the
finest
offering
by
this
trappist
monestary
and
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
belgian
double
style

there
is
a
nice

well
this
beer
is
highly
carbonated
at
the
start
but
calms
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
and
almost
chewy
coating
the
tongue
but
very
pleasantly
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
dubbels
but
this
truly
is
an
exemplary
beer
if
you
can
get
it
you
must
between
medium
and
full
bodied
smooth
easy
to
drink
with
perfect
carbonation
try
as
hard
as
i
can
i
cannot
find
a
flaw
with
this
beer
this
is
so
drinkable
it
is
insane
the
8

alcohol
is
perfectly
hidden
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
except
that
this
is
a
perfect
beer
overall
im
not
blown
away
by
this
beer
especially
when
it
comes
so
highly
rated
it
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
with
some
funky
trappist
notes
served

drinkability
i
expected
this
as
one
may
assume
to
be
pretty
amazing
and
though
it
was
good
and
i
enjoyed
it
ive
had
better
and
more
complex
and
nuanced
dubbels
in
the
past
did
i
wait
too
long
since
ive
had
the
bottle
for
five
years
or
more
i
thought
this
would
keep
for
many
more
years
im
glad
i
finally
tried
it
and
waited
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
it
just
feels
like
its
a
shadow
of
its
former
self
in
some
ways
or
that
its
lost
a
step
maybe
someday
ill
get
to
try
a
12
pours
a
chocolate
murky
brown
haze
with
an
off
white
foam
head
is
less
creamy
and
the
alcohol
comes
through
more
than
with
its
12
brethren
sweet
up
front
dark
fruit
throughout
nice
chocolate
notes
on
the
back
end
has
a
dry
sweet
finish
very
nice
beer
drinkability
tons
of
complexity
from
start
to
finish
easily
one
of
the
top
dubbels
out
there
drinkability
super
impressed
worth
the
anticipation
but
maybe
not
the
price
amazing
flavors
amazing
scent
and
huge
complexity
this
never
once
got
boring
only
made
me
want
more
the
8
is
well
hidden
this
is
a
treat
and
i
would
give
anything
for
another
its
lovely
and
warming
as
you
drink
it
just
as
good
as
its
big
brother
just
enough
character
to
distinguish
it
from
being
westy
12
jr
d
a
superb
dubbel
i
can
definitely
see
how
this
has
had
rave
reviews
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
and
a
joy
to
consume
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
a
more
regular
basis
if
it
was
not
so
hard
to
acquire
i
am
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
i
wish
i
had
another
it
was
well
worth
the
money
drinkability
is
endless
it
goes
down
so
smoothly
and
is
so
delicious
with
only
the
slightest
bite
from
the
alcohol
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
certainly
lived
up
to
the
hype
md
medium
body
with
a
semisweet
finish
not
dry
at
all
hardly
any
alcohol
flavor
and
the
flavor
combination
present
in
this
beer
makes
it
way
too
easy
to
drink
great
beer
as
amazing
as
westy
12
is
i
would
have
to
say
i
enjoy
this
a
bit
more
due
simply
to
the
fact
that
its
more
drinkable
this
brew
pours
a
beautiful
dark
caramel
brown
pure
belgian
on
the
front
end
and
roasty
sweetness
on
the
back
end
how
could
i
not
like
a
beer
that
cost
over
35
for
a
12
oz
bottle
since
it
was
a
gift
i
like
it
even
better
if
you
have
an
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
please
do
i
actually
like
the
12
better
though
pours
a
hazy
russet
with
lots
of
fine
bubbles
and
a
dense
cappuccinocolored
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
cap
the
smell
is
cherry
oak
papaya
and
honey
the
taste
is
complex
sweet
tropical
fruit
oak
some
nuttiness
and
a
bitter
mineral
finish
its
a
little
creamy
highly
effervescent
dense
but
light
at
the
same
time
dreamy
it
goes
down
easy
but
im
sipping
it
wish
i
had
another
part
of
the
reason
for
the
apparent
lightness
of
the
flavor
may
be
the
high
degree
of
carbonation
i
would
say
that
it
masks
some
of
the
flavors
trying
to
be
an
attraction
of
its
own
but
it
does
seem
to
energize
the
beer
deftly
concealing
the
moderate
alcohol
level
and
thus
helping
it
go
down
way
too
easily
as
the
carbonation
settles
out
a
bit
the
flavors
are
allowed
to
shine
a
bit
more
bringing
on
a
kind
of
second
stage
of
the
drinking
experience
overall
this
one
is
truly
interesting
unique
and
exceptionally
drinkable
d
it
gets
too
sweet
and
syrupy
for
me
to
session
but
could
drink
a
decent
amount
of
this
happily
great
brew
very
drinkable
with
its
8
i
put
this
beer
in
a
category
of
its
own
its
a
winner
and
clearly
a
champion
d
one
of
the
best
dubbels
i
have
had
for
sure
an
excellent
trappist
i
spent
some
time
savoring
this
but
would
love
to
see
what
it
is
like
fresh
i
think
it
might
rate
a
bit
higher
since
the
age
could
have
dried
it
out
a
bit
i
figured
i
should
pop
open
something
decent
for
my
birthday
and
i
figured
this
would
do
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thick
head
grape
caramel
malt
candi
sugar
and
tobacco
nose
flavor
was
very
similar
lots
of
dark
fruits
come
out
as
well
finish
was
thick
lots
of
stuff
going
on
but
not
something
i
really
cared
for
cheers
to
the
great
dubbels
of
belgium
drinkability
most
dubbels
ive
had
are
a
bit
thicker
or
richer
which
makes
this
one
stand
out
unbelievably
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
anytime
anywhere
o
complex
but
very
drinkable
lots
of
different
flavors
that
are
well
balanced
best
dubbel
i
have
ever
had
and
i
could
drink
a
6
pack
if
i
wanted
to
crappie
flop
all
over
the
place
as
the
alcohol
is
quite
high
get
this
beer
wow
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
that
hasnt
already
been
said
its
a
little
bit
sweet
with
figs
dried
plums
and
brown
sugar
throughout
a
brief
hint
of
hops
there
is
a
nice
chewiness
about
the
beer
and
it
has
a
spicy
dry
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
that
tops
the
whole
thing
off
making
this
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
and
agin
d
my
first
westy
didnt
disappoint
im
not
always
the
biggest
fan
of
dubbels
but
this
was
quite
complex
and
flavorful
i
understand
why
its
so
highly
regarded
d
the
carbonation
issue
and
the
associated
bloatiness
makes
it
hard
to
drink
in
volume
o
a
beer
that
is
worth
its
top
10
magical
status
but
ive
enjoyed
other
beers
more
the
pinnacle
of
dubbels
probably
d
any
day
absolutely
delicious
tasty
fruity
yeasty
and
a
perfect
beer
for
the
moment
whatever
the
moment
may
be
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
this
is
the
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
so
let
me
say
that
up
front
i
could
just
breathe
in
the
smell
all
day
like
putting
your
face
in
a
bag
of
sugar
but
balanced
by
apples
and
dark
fruits
this
bottle
was
2yr
old
and
the
flavor
had
synthesized
in
a
way
that
i
do
not
have
grammar
to
describe
there
is
a
subtlety
depth
and
smoothness
that
is
unmatched
by
any
dubble
i
have
ever
had
westmalle
is
a
close
second
but
this
is
the
ultimate
i
drank
the
8
last
night
july
30th
2011
after
i
drank
a
westy
12
there
is
a
big
difference
between
these
beers
always
has
been
the
one
i
had
yesterday
had
a
bit
more
sourness
in
it
than
i
could
remember
this
is
a
very
easytodrink
trappist
beer
i
prefer
it
to
the
12
d
amazing
such
a
complex
and
wonderful
beer
i
actually
think
i
like
this
better
than
the
12
at
least
while
they
are
relatively
fresh
pours
a
clear
amberbrown
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
a
massive
light
tan
head
out
of
this
large
head
bellows
the
aromas
of
fruit
spices
and
yeast
that
make
the
mouth
water
the
nice
blend
of
flavors
is
a
repeat
of
the
smell
but
with
more
complexity
my
first
official
beer
review
and
my
first
westvleteren
8
great
way
to
start
things
i
dont
usually
like
dubbel
but
theres
just
nothing
to
say
here
the
key
i
feel
is
that
its
so
wellbalanced
theres
nothing
extreme
in
this
beer
but
just
unquestionable
craftsmanship
overall
this
is
my
first
westvleteren
8
and
it
is
quite
good
its
not
a
top
10
beer
in
my
book
but
definitely
the
best
dubbel
i
have
ever
had
the
westvleteren
12
is
amazing
and
i
guess
the
8
fits
in
nicely
as
the
runner
up
to
westvleterens
flagship
beer
if
you
havent
had
the
8
its
worth
buyingtrading
for
an
excellent
belgian
both
in
taste
and
style
this
might
be
my
best
in
style
for
the
dubbel
if
only
it
were
more
available
a
lot
of
things
are
sayed
about
trappist
beers
and
i
am
positive
the
are
all
true
out
of
a
bottle
this
famous
and
highly
soughtafter
beer
was
a
deer
brown
color
that
was
approaching
black
some
ruby
highlights
could
be
seen
when
held
up
to
a
bright
light
the
retention
and
lacing
were
both
impressive
the
aroma
was
rich
and
bold
with
an
array
of
dark
elements
such
as
chocolate
plums
figs
and
raisins
some
earth
and
wood
coffee
and
caramel
malt
the
flavors
were
just
as
intense
and
varied
but
i
find
myself
compelled
to
add
a
caveat
here
having
tried
the
westy
12
i
thought
this
beer
the
8
to
be
great
yet
still
lacking
the
dimension
of
subtlety
and
finesse
that
the
12
developed
dont
get
me
wrong
many
of
the
undeniably
advanced
elements
that
the
westy
8
possessed
impressed
me
but
i
just
didnt
think
it
was
as
well
executed
as
it
could
be
the
mouthfeel
was
just
as
smooth
and
rich
as
one
could
want
however
and
the
body
as
full
as
one
would
expect
equally
the
carbonation
was
spot
on
a
very
very
good
beer
and
worthy
of
being
classified
as
one
of
the
worlds
best
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
this
same
brewery
produces
a
slightly
great
beer
than
this
one
one
would
indeed
be
inclined
to
say
it
is
the
best
in
the
world
no
doubt
as
far
as
the
dubbel
style
is
concerned
it
remains
an
undisputed
bar
by
which
others
are
measured
d
i
would
drink
24
of
these
if
it
wasnt
so
damn
hard
to
get

all
kind
of

that
is

into
lingering

silky
smooth

with

the
smoothest

ive
ever

perhaps
less

without
evident

and
a

but
nevertheless
equally
good
as
the
big
brother
this
is
yet
again
another
excellent
beer
a
little
more
restrained
than
the

an
excellent

peppery
with
a
slight
bit
of

of
plum
cocoa
lots
of

peppery
and
quite
a

of
prickly
carbonation
pours
a
murky
cloudy
opaque
medium
dark
brown
with

suffice
the

and
around

the

is
highly
cherry
plum
fig
and
other
dark
fruits
along
with
maybe
even
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
and
some
bread
the
flavor
is
also
cherry
fig
and
dark
fruits
with
a
yeast
bread
presence
not
overly
sweet
extremely
well
balanced
the
fruits
come
through
even
more
as
the
beer
warms
i
may
actually
enjoy
this
over
the
12
i
will
have
to
try
it
again
d
world
class
in
every
sense
of
the
word
superbly
drinkable
and
amazingly
flavorful
truly
a
brew
to
be
sipped
and
savored
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
less
thick
than
the
westvleteren
12
the
number
one
beer
in
the
world
this
one
is
actually
far
better
balanced
and
dare
i
say
it
actually
may
be
an
all
around
better
drinking
beer
but
this
is
my
first
one
i
have
3
more
bottles
to
go
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
not
a
top
15
beer
probably
not
top
100
its
just
not
super
special
m
silky
smooth
but
with
more
body
velvety
taste
is
also
not
a
letdown
very
sweet
carbonated
raisons
malts
wow
overall
very
good
clean
and
unique
gets
too
sweet
and
thin
as
it
warms
not
any
better
than
westmalle
dubbel
or
st
b
8
overall
a
decent
beer
i
suppose
nothing
ever
lives
up
to
the
hype
it
gets
this
one
wanted
to
it
just
didnt
make
it
for
me
i
will
have
to
try
it
again
fro
comparisons
sake
d
very
drinkable
for
the
percent
in
part
because
all
the
flavors
are
so
mellow
and
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
great
tasting
well
brewed
and
a
very
delicious
beer
i
would
welcome
any
opportunity
to
have
this
again
o
very
full
rich
caramel
sweetness
but
dries
nicely
complex
nice
hop
presence
unique
alcohol
becomes
a
bit
rough
with
warmth
this
one
had
the
unfortunate
case
of
a
gusher
due
to
bringing
it
home
in
my
backpack
after
miles
of
walking
it
pours
opaque
deep
redbrown
nose
is
raisins
cranberries
soft
cloves
flavor
is
more
of
the
dark
fruit
plus
perhaps
some
banana
and
finishes
with
a
hint
of
saltiness
and
well
balanced
phenols
the
feel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
a
bit
creamy
given
the
taste
of
course
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
if
we
are
allowed
to
factor
in
the
difficulty
of
acquiring
the
beer
i
know
to
take
my
time
with
it
and
enjoy
or
split
only
one
bottle
pours
very
dark
brown
with
almost
no
light
passing
through
a
thick
tan
head
forms
on
top
and
slowly
fades
it
never
really
goes
anywhere
its
lasts
as
i
drink
it
and
laces
beautifully
aroma
is
a
wonderful
mixture
of
dark
fruit
plum
raisin
fig
some
candi
sugar
and
belgian
yeast
round
out
this
gem
prickly
mouthfeel
from
the
high
carbonation
flavors
follow
the
nose
and
finish
semidry
alcohol
is
hidden
well
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
overall
great
drinkability
nice
sweet
fruity
and
a
little
nutty
character
not
overly
sweet
balanced
with
a
great
dry
roasted
flavor
a
small
alcohol
presence
but
that
is
expected
with
and
abv
of
8
all
of
the
flavors
blend
well
together
well
i
picked
this
one
up
because
they
were
selling
it
but
i
think
i
should
have
just
bought
another
bottle
of
the
westy
12
which
is
volumes
better
than
this
brew
either
way
for
me
personally
the
price
these
bottles
achieve
it
too
high
the
hype
and
exclusivity
keep
the
ratings
high
dont
get
me
wrong
they
are
excellent
belgian
beers
but
a
rochefort
8
or
abt
12
is
on
the
same
caliber
for
13
the
price
very
drinkable
too
bad
its
so
difficult
to
acquire
thanks
to
dbatch
for
sending
me
a
bottle
of
this
on
his
belgian
expedition
this
year
he
was
bummed
that
they
didnt
sell
the
12
for
takeaway
from
the
brewery
the
visuals
are
a
deep
brownred
hue
with
a
big
soapy
head
that
recedes
to
a
nice
foamy
cap
the
smell
is
very
crisp
and
clean
with
lots
of
belgian
yeast
and
malt
along
with
traces
of
nuts
fruits
and
spices
one
of
the
best
aromas
i
have
ever
experienced
in
the
taste
you
pick
up
dark
fruits
along
with
a
light
caramel
sweetness
with
a
return
of
the
roasted
malt
and
yeast
from
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
creamy
although
a
little
bland
at
the
finish
for
my
taste
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
and
definitely
worth
the
hype
although
wish
it
was
more
available
over
here
in
the
states
and
at
the
end
of
the
rochefort
westvleteren
challenge
its
rochefort
by
a
nose
the
mission
is
still
on
to
sample
the
westvleteren
12
deep
brown
color
with
a
strong
lacy
tan
head
malty
nutty
aroma
full
mouth
complex
malty
vinuous
nutty
flavor
with
hints
of
dates
raisins
and
dark
cherries
amazing
complexity
grows
with
each
year
of
storage
younger
brother
of
the
12
and
very
nearly
as
good
vintage
this
beer
was
bottled
on
august
27
2008
o
honestly
fantastic
beer
despite
of
the
hype
around
westys
theres
no
way
to
deny
that
this
is
a
just
another
perfect
beer
made
by
the
sint
sixtus
monks
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
its
easy
to
drink
on
the
other
hand
its
not
that
interesting
and
in
my
humble
opinion
unnecessarily
rare
and
expensive
md
when
reviewing
a
world
class
beer
like
this
it
seems
like
you
never
want
to
drink
more
than
one
for
want
of
being
mad
at
yourself
for
dipping
that
far
into
your
stash
however
the
clean
finish
on
this
beer
makes
it
exceedingly
drinkable
i
imagine
that
this
is
what
monks
kill
68
of
per
night
to
keep
the
faith
the
mouthfeel
is
basically
perfect
for
the
style
d
superb
a
very
nice
dubbel
perhaps
the
best
the
combination
of
profound
flavors
solid
carbonation
and
a
good
body
makes
this
a
very
pleasant
experience
good
beer
not
worth
the
trouble
to
obtain
though
drinkability
a
great
flavor
with
a
great
texture
despite
the
alcohol
this
is
supremely
drinkable
d
off
the
charts
for
the
style
for
those
interested
the
bottle
shop
a
few
doors
down
had
some
of
the
8
in
their
cooler
d
a
bit
too
prickly
really
tasty
though
just
behind
the
12
but
very
good
in
its
own
right
im
going
out
on
a
limb
here
and
saying
that
it
is
better
than
west
12
bye
got
a
westy
8
served
in
a
chimay
goblet
at
least
its
a
trappist
glass
thick
fine
brown
head
the
head
was
great
when
i
poured
it
and
has
lasted
as
i
drink
the
head
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
amazing
that
great
smell
of
belgian
yeast
like
on
the
air
the
carbonation
is
steady
with
tiny
bubbles
all
over
the
outside
of
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
i
could
drink
10
of
these
in
no
time
at
all
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
yeasty
it
is
a
great
example
of
a
style
that
i
am
not
usually
thrilled
with
dubbels
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
truly
one
of
the
great
beers
of
the
world
pours
garnetbrown
color
with
huge
light
tan
head
theres
some
yeast
murk
even
though
i
left
a
lot
of
it
in
the
bottle
even
10
minutes
after
pouring
theres
still
quite
a
bit
of
foam
sitting
on
the
surface
i
dont
even
know
how
to
describe
this
smell
since
i
havent
smelled
many
beers
like
it
fresh
apples
grapes
a
cornucopia
of
other
dark
fruits
yeast
theres
all
sorts
of
other
stuff
going
on
that
i
cant
identify
same
goes
for
the
taste
the
balance
of
fruit
malt
spice
and
candi
sugar
is
really
good
and
theres
a
very
slight
tartness
that
underlies
everything
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
because
of
all
the
hype
i
didnt
want
to
give
this
beer
a
high
score
if
i
could
help
it
but
the
acclaim
is
well
deserved
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
reminds
me
that
many
american
brewers
have
a
long
way
to
go
to
replicate
the
quality
of
great
belgianstyle
beers
overall
literature
varies
whether
this
is
a
dubbel
or
strong
ale
either
way
it
tastes
almost
like
nice
cream
ale
or
something
but
wunique
belgian
qualities
could
drink
all
day
and
would
if
i
could
buy
it
locally
delicious
bottled
in
september
of
2008
pours
thickly
veiled
brown
with
yellowtan
highlights
almost
like
the
inside
of
an
overripe
plum
modest
head
dissipates
to
a
fine
surface
film
smells
of
prune
plum
banana
a
little
bit
of
cherrytinged
funk
comes
together
to
smell
a
bit
like
unsweetened
purple
grape
juice
the
smell
is
a
true
harbinger
of
the
taste
deep
plum
and
light
caramel
flavors
form
the
backbone
as
banana
and
subtle
cherry
tart
notes
take
turns
the
light
tartness
builds
a
bit
and
ends
up
being
the
last
note
at
the
finish
line
lots
of
subtle
complexity
here
for
the
style
no
one
flavor
dominates
or
speaks
out
of
turn
very
drinkable
in
that
you
can
keep
discovering
new
flavors
over
multiple
servings
a
real
standout
in
the
belgian
brown
class
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
could
drink
these
all
day
an
excellent
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
maybe
not
to
the
level
as
its
revered
the
flavor
is
good
although
it
needs
a
little
more
complexity
for
me
to
really
be
amazing
at
face
value
the
flavor
is
just
too
predominantly
brown
sugar
caramel
and
i
wish
the
darker
fruits
would
have
come
out
more
mfd
how
do
you
describe
a
perfect
dubbel
the
feel
is
perfect
perfect
small
crisp
carbonation
combine
with
the
ample
body
to
make
a
completely
chewy
and
creamy
experience
the
beer
is
so
incredibly
creamy
from
the
carbonation
and
the
body
coupled
with
the
carbonation
makes
this
rich
chewy
kind
of
feeling
simply
superb
needless
to
say
i
would
drink
this
anytime
with
anything
i
just
cant
wait
to
see
what
the
12
has
in
store
d
wow
a
unique
experience
this
makes
me
want
to
store
beer
without
the
dusty
taste
of
course
these
beers
really
need
to
be
in
bombers
well
i
guess
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
dubbels
just
are
not
a
style
i
can
enjoy
this
is
the
highest
rated
dubbel
on
ba
in
the
top
10
overall
and
possibly
the
best
one
i
have
had
yet
i
still
cant
bring
myself
to
give
it
more
than
a
4
for
taste
i
was
hoping
that
this
one
would
break
the
streak
and
stand
out
like
its
big
brother
12
does
but
alas
it
ends
up
being
just
a
good
beer
for
my
palate
overall
really
a
fantastic
beer
pity
this
bottle
had
a
slightly
hidden
dusty
taste
a
previous
bottle
from
the
same
batch
was
better
i
think
i
will
rate
that
bottle
instead
of
this
one
anyhow
one
of
the
better
beers
one
can
have
get
it
get
it
get
it
i
will
drink
it
surely
again
the
unlabeled
bottle
looks
really
good
the
beer
in
the
glass
also
starts
modest
malty
a
little
bit
alcoholic
not
too
intense
finish
mild
notes
of
marzipan
warming
harmonic
aftertaste
really
good
but
not
as
good
as
exspected
thanks
to
henriksoegaard
for
the
bottle
delicious
d
this
went
down
really
easy
despite
its
big
beer
status
and
strong
flavors
a
testament
to
its
balance
and
craft
its
unfortunate
that
it
costs
so
damn
much
but
i
must
honestly
admit
id
buy
it
again
if
i
had
the
chance
d
great
this
sipper
is
amazing
truelt
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
its
a
style
i
usually
dont
enjoy
much
of
at
all
i
had
this
bottle
in
my
cellar
for
nearly
a
year
after
it
was
sent
to
me
from
abroad
it
poured
a
fairly
dark
hazy
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
dissipated
a
little
but
held
a
nice
thin
covering
even
after
a
few
sips
the
smell
is
amazing
rich
aroma
of
dark
fruits
malt
and
some
hops
at
first
the
taste
hits
with
sweet
caramel
and
dark
fruit
raisin
fig
and
then
some
slight
sting
of
alcohol
that
fades
into
gentle
bread
malts
i
had
to
stop
myself
from
drinking
it
too
fast
because
i
wanted
to
drink
it
down
in
one
gulp
it
was
that
delicious
even
the
the
belching
that
followed
tasted
delightful
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
big
foamy
light
tan
head
that
resists
fading
visibly
effervescent
the
collar
leaves
excellent
stringy
patterns
of
belgian
lace
the
smell
is
rich
and
earthy
dark
fruit
and
malty
cocoa
lively
mouth
feel
with
a
little
heat
and
a
lighter
body
that
works
with
the
full
rich
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
the
lingering
aspect
adds
complexity
that
gives
it
a
larger
presence
a
really
nice
drinker
gone
way
too
quickly
many
thanks
to
alen
for
the
opportunity
i
received
this
bottle
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
i
cant
remember
who
from
so
i
cant
give
you
credit
whoever
you
are
poured
an
active
murky
oily
redishbrown
body
with
an
off
whitetan
head
that
lasted
a
while
smells
of
cherry
raisin
very
floral
taste
was
amazing
with
dark
fruits
as
in
the
taste
the
8
come
through
in
the
end
as
it
warms
a
bit
medium
body
that
was
fairly
fizzy
d
a
good
beer
very
good
actually
complex
well
balanced
and
tasty
but
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
perhaps
not
in
my
humble
opinion
after
taking
my
last
sip
wheatman106
jimmy
and
i
cracked
open
the
westveleteren
12
and
to
say
the
least
we
all
were
blown
away
by
both
of
this
beers
kudos
to
the
trappist
monks
without
them
i
would
not
know
what
the
taste
of
perfection
would
be
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
i
was
almost
expecting
a
chewy
feel
based
on
the
look
but
its
really
pretty
smooth
drinkability
is
decent
i
still
think
the
westmalle
dubbel
is
better
as
far
as
wesvleteren
goes
i
think
this
one
is
better
than
the
blonde
but
not
as
good
as
the
12
very
happy
i
got
to
try
it
though
this
is
drinkable
brew
and
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
as
it
seems
its
not
the
easiest
beer
to
acquire
overall
this
beer
lived
up
to
its
billing
the
flavors
werent
the
best
part
of
the
beer
but
rather
how
they
entered
and
faded
at
just
the
right
times
though
the
solid
levels
of
carbonation
helped
things
along
nicely
however
ive
heard
many
people
say
they
liked
the
8
better
than
the
12
and
i
have
to
respectfully
disagree
though
just
by
a
hair
give
both
a
shot
if
at
all
possible
d
absolutely
a
wellcrafted
beer
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
id
definitely
drink
it
more
often
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
come
across
goes
down
very
smooth
and
surprisingly
light
great
drinkability
if
only
this
wasnt
so
hard
to
obtain
or
should
i
add
at
a
more
friendly
price
it
feels
slightly
blasphemous
but
i
was
not
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
do
have
a
few
more
bottles
and
i
will
happy
to
give
it
another
chance
every
opportunity
i
get
i
get
the
feeling
that
this
could
definitely
benefit
from
aging
for
a
good
while
and
ill
definitely
be
putting
that
theory
to
practice
given
the
young
age
of
this
particular
bottle
drinkability
wow
really
just
outstanding
low
apparent
abv
but
it
rocks
and
i
want
another
sip
and
another
and
another
i
want
to
marry
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
smooth
with
a
strong
biting
carbonation
a
million
thanks
go
out
to

a
dark

color
with
amber
highlights
a
thin
cap
that
stuck
around
throughout
and
little
lacing
lots
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
that
i
tried
to
keep
out

is
grassy
a
bit
of
dark

brown

herbaceous

a

a
bit
of
grassiness
and
a
hint
of
musty
sourness
the
aftertaste
lingers
for
quite
a
bit
and
theres
a
faint
roasted
coffee
and
burnt

flavor
that
sticks
to
the
tongue
tastes
fantastic
flavor
is
on
the
higher
side

but
still
medium
and
nice
crisp
carbonation
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
i
could
only
see
myself
having
one
at
a
time
but
it
was
great
to
be
able
to
sample
this
rare
treat
thanks
again
jason
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
offwhite
head
into
my
chimay
goblet
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
which
i
prefer
dark
fruit
plums
cranberries
raisins
etc
really
sticks
out
on
my
palate
along
with
some
alcohol
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
lightmedium
in
body
coats
the
mouth
well
i
prefer
this
dubbel
to
the
quad
and
will
drink
again
for
sure
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
lives
up
to
the
hype
really
fortunate
to
have
tried
this
at
least
once
and
i
really
hope
to
be
able
to
have
it
again
someday
really
is
a
shame
i
cant
access
this
regularly
wonderful
brew
p
s
i
appreciated
this
one
more
than
the
12
overall
a
let
down
for
me
a
good
beer
but
not
an
outstanding
one
from
my
point
of
view
it
really
felt
like
i
was
drinking
liquid
herbs
no
other
way
to
explain
it
and
really
overpowered
any
other
flavor
that
might
have
been
there
not
too
pleasant
still
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
to
give
it
another
chance
overall
this
one
is
definitely
worth
the
hype
easily
the
best
allround
belgian
dubbel
ive
had
and
ive
certainly
had
my
share
i
could
never
wait
for
the
next
sip
the
smell
and
especially
the
taste
profile
make
this
one
totally
worthy
of
its
top
10
spot
and
a
musttry
for
every
beer
lover
out
there
ill
certainly
be
picking
more
of
these
up
when
i
happen
to
see
them
recommended
very
good
standout
brew
great
beer
big
thanks
to
ygtbsm94
i
was
glad
to
try
this
with
a
little
age
on
it
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
try
a
benchmark
as
a
wellcrafted
dubbel
but
is
it
worthy
of
a
top
10
rating
on
my
list
probably
not
if
i
had
to
use
one
word
to
describe
this
beer
it
would
be
graceful
truly
worldclass
in
every
sense
d
very
smooth
very
drinkable
and
very
moreish
for
the
sweettooth
wonderful
pours
a
very
dark
brown
hazy
looking
with
a
cm
thick
offwhite
head
that
kind
of
falls
back
and
sticks
around
looks
about
right
the
smell
is
immediately
of
sweetness
there
are
notes
of
chocolate
mixed
in
with
just
a
note
of
coffee
there
is
a
tiny
note
of
alcohol
a
few
estery
smells
there
is
very
faintly
an
earthy
spicy
smell
the
taste
has
a
colacaramel
sweetness
but
is
backed
with
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
theres
chocolate
and
raisins
and
dark
roasted
malts
and
tamarind
with
a
pleasant
estery
finish
the
alcohol
warms
on
the
finish
but
is
barely
detectable
otherwise
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
more
chewy
but
there
is
a
bit
of
body
to
it
but
the
carbonation
provides
a
pleasant
tickle
on
the
way
down
the
drinkability
of
this
is
really
what
shines
i
just
wanted
to
chug
it
down
and
go
on
to
the
next
and
id
certainly
feel
that
one
on
my
wallet
but
i
knew
that
i
needed
to
wait
and
savor
this
one
overall
well
crafted
not
my
thing
a
very
nice
dubbel
the
best
ive
had
over
all
this
was
a
nice
beer
preferred
it
colder
over
room
temp
which
is
one
of
the
only
things
that
i
feel
brings
it
down
overall
this
is
above
and
beyond
any
of
dubbel
ive
had
a
must
try
cheers
everyone
should
try
this
beer
i
will
always
try
to
keep
one
if
these
around
for
a
special
treat
every
once
in
a
while
drinkability
is
great
perfectly
balanced
a
world
class
treat
i
am
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
tried
seek
it
out
obviously
notes
what
a
pleasure
to
have
this
beer
along
with
its
big
brother
the
12
tonight
12oz
bottle
big
thanks
to
deepsouth
for
sending
this
my
way
first
off
this
smells
pretty
amazing
light
hints
of
cherry
and
malts
but
just
a
real
nice
smell
raisins
the
flavor
is
a
nice
bready
dubbel
nice
beer
remimds
me
of
the
westmalle
dubbel
a
little
bit
very
good
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
just
incredible
its
strength
is
not
apparent
in
the
taste
just
in
the
aftereffects
i
have
no
desire
at
all
to
drink
this
one
quickly
but
i
feel
like
its
a
flavor
id
never
get
sick
of
absolutely
a
drink
to
savor
and
enjoy
i
will
look
forward
to
trying
the
12
drinkability
a
very
nice
sipper
and
if
there
beer
were
readily
available
i
would
purchase
it
often
i
was
quite
worried
when
i
decided
to
open
this
it
could
easily
have
been
utterly
foul
but
this
beer
has
aged
remarkably
well
i
suspect
itd
score
a
little
better
earlier
in
its
life
particularly
in
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
categories
but
im
very
glad
to
have
been
lucky
enough
to
score
such
an
ancient
bottle
gives
me
hope
for
the
1980s
westy
abt
and
westy
6
i
have
kicking
around
d
great
for
sipping
however
you
wouldnt
down
these
as
you
would
any
other
dubbel
mainly
because
youd
want
to
savor
the
flavor
and
work
out
its
complexities
drinkable
um
yes
exceptional
absolutely
exceptional
unbelievable
worth
every
bit
of
hype
youve
ever
heard
oh
drinkability
amazing
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
i
always
try
to
go
into
these
higher
ranked
beers
with
a
open
mind
and
not
let
any
hype
reflect
my
reviewing
as
a
huge
fan
of
all
beers
though
its
nearly
impossible
to
not
enjoy
this
beer
considering
the
availability
of
this
brew
and
of
rochefort
rochefort
definitely
makes
a
great
substitute
maybe
not
as
good
but
pretty
close
big
thanks
to
greg
an
older
bottle
this
time
it
seems
to
have
mellowed
and
improved
an
exceptionally
good
beer
though
not
quite
up
to
the
wow
factor
of
the
westie
12
more
bitterness
and
hop
flavour
than
the
rest
of
the
trappist
breweries
drinkability
one
of
the
smoothest
easiest
to
drink
8
abv
beverages
that
will
touch
your
lips
much
less
intense
than
the
12
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
time
to
enjoy
now
umm
incredible
thinner
than
the
12
well
see
if
a
12
pops
out
of
the
cellar
for
a
comparison
to
end
my
internal
debate
once
and
for
all
is
an
aged
westvleteren
8
better
than
a
fresh
westvleteren
12
d
highly
drinkable
and
unfortunately
very
rare
delicious
huge
thanks
to
isubsmith
for
hooking
up
his
fellow
rochester
bas
with
this
rare
beer
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
light
tan
and
recedes
slowly
into
firm
lacing
which
sticks
all
over
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
plums
anise
leather
and
hints
of
cranberry
and
dry
apple
cider
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
wtih
lively
fine
carbonation
and
a
silky
texture
overall
this
is
a
great
complex
belgian
dubbel
i
would
love
to
make
this
part
of
my
regular
drinking
rotation
drinkability
id
drink
nothing
but
if
they
werent
so
difficult
to
come
by
d
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
perhaps
this
beer
is
somewhat
overrated
but
there
is
no
argument
that
it
is
at
least
a
really
solid
dubbel
anyway
wow
is
this
ever
a
pretty
beer
head
on
the
bigger
side
of
medium
tiny
dark
bubbles
ridiculously
lasting
lace
opaque
brown
smells
of
grass
and
brown
sugar
ah
well
the
nose
doesnt
lie
brown
sugars
aplenty
there
only
sugar
in
flavor
and
not
in
sweetness
its
pretty
even
and
mellow
this
has
that
belgian
astringency
that
is
missing
in
the
12
its
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
md
i
would
barely
call
it
full
bodied
and
very
rich
feel
in
the
mouth
well
carbonated
incredible
dubbel
and
very
easy
drinking
i
think
id
take
this
over
a
westy
12
md
slightly
over
carbonated
full
body
drinkability
is
decent
as
well
not
really
wooed
by
this
beer
its
good
probably
not
my
favorite
dubble
very
balance
with
the
aroma
its
most
redeeming
quality
mouthfeel
was
lively
effervescent
but
not
overly
carbonated
medium
to
full
bodied
all
around
nice
beer
i
drank
this
one
entirely
too
fast
so
good
this
beer
just
didnt
seem
to
have
a
whole
lot
going
on
it
was
sweet
and
it
tasted
like
the
artificial
grape
flavoring
you
get
from
candy
it
wasnt
overwhelming
to
make
it
bad
but
the
beer
just
didnt
impress
me
a
whole
lot
that
doesnt
mean
i
didnt
like
it
but
it
was
just
weird
d
definitely
a
world
class
ale
i
still
cannot
decide
if
i
liked
the
westy
8
or
12
better
either
way
this
beer
is
worth
the
hype
but
not
necessarily
the
cost
as
it
warms
it
gets
much
better
same
character
just
better
pours
a
beautiful
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
frothy
inch
off
whitean
head
smells
of
rich
malts
fruity
hops
and
belgian
yeasts
first
sip
is
way
smooth
crisp
and
tangy
with
a
lovely
balance
of
malt
hops
and
yeast
sweet
and
then
slightly
bitter
with
pears
being
the
dominate
fruit
super
creamy
lacing
clings
so
happily
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
so
very
good
so
very
good
indeed
world
class
much
better
than
the
blonde
this
is
making
me
want
to
crack
the
12
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
d
could
do
a
few
d
overall
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
with
a
rich
maltiness
full
of
caramel
and
maple
syrup
sweetness
with
a
vast
complexity
of
dried
fruit
drinks
like
a
dream
leaving
a
sweet
malty
lacing
behind
believe
it
its
not
just
hype
truly
a
standout
beer
amongst
all
others
and
the
best
beer
in
the
world
drinkability
great
very
good
i
would
highly
recommend
this
overall
another
world
class
brew
from
brouwerij
westvleteren
although
i
think
a
little
more
age
on
this
would
have
made
it
even
better
outstanding
and
highly
recommended
overall
a
very
very
enjoyable
and
tasty
dubbel
very
very
rich
and
fruity
taste
really
alot
of
quad
like
flavor
in
here
with
the
dark
fruit
richness
another
hit
from
westy
12
will
always
be
their
shining
example
to
me
but
8
is
also
a
very
very
nice
beer
pours
a
murky
icedtea
color
with
some
nice
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
a
crazydense
beige
head
hangs
around
for
the
duration
diminishing
very
slowly
in
size
but
never
disappearing
lots
of
sediment
is
suspended
in
the
beer
and
some
yeast
spills
out
of
the
bottle
leaving
some
dark
brown
swirls
in
the
foamy
head
lots
of
fig
raisin
and
apple
on
the
nose
red
apple
flavors
come
through
a
lot
more
as
it
warms
light
brown
sugar
some
earthiness
very
finely
carbonated
really
creamy
as
it
hits
your
lips
but
the
carbonation
makes
this
one
almost
refreshing
this
would
pair
with
lots
of
dishes
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
im
thrilled
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
d
drinkability
is
great
for
a
sippingoriented
beer
i
found
myself
drinking
it
back
without
much
second
thought
easy
sailing
on
here
perhaps
moreso
than
some
other
dubbels
overall
a
wonderful
brew
able
to
drink
it
with
a
little
more
ease
than
the
12
but
in
terms
of
flavour
and
feel
the
big
brother
still
takes
it
for
my
palate
d
i
could
drink
a
case
of
this
and
not
blink
these
monks
know
what
the
fuck
is
going
on
this
beer
is
damned
near
perfect
i
want
more
and
i
want
to
move
to
belgium
if
you
get
the
chance
do
it
all
of
the
above
overall
a
pretty
good
dubbel
its
pretty
tasty
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
d
an
excellent
beer
just
slightly
under
the
12
tastewise
i
would
rate
this
one
as
more
drinkable
in
comparison
it
was
great
to
drink
and
with
the
lower
alcohol
just
makes
it
easier
to
have
multiples
and
enjoy
the
goodness
i
owe
thanks
to
abankovich
for
a
bottle
i
think
phawk
or
akorsak
also
sent
one
thanks
guys
drinks
easy
enough
this
must
be
a
younger
bottle
i
personally
was
too
paranoid
to
sit
on
this
bottle
for
too
long
if
you
have
a
safe
cellar
me
i
have
2
kids
under
9
then
age
this
to
your
hearts
content
this
is
not
close
to
my
favorite
dubbel
feel
very
fortunate
to
get
to
try
it
though
d
wow
very
awesome
i
think
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
drinkability
rich
punchy
and
packed
with
a
fruitastic
estery
character
although
it
lacks
the
depth
of
the
yellowcapped
twelve
or
the
drinkability
of
the
greencapped
blonde
still
recommended
though
i
tried
this
beer
after
doing
research
on
the
trappist
brewers
all
i
can
say
is
wow
amazing
beer
that
is
the
best
that
i
have
tried
thus
far
in
my
life
i
now
have
beer
that
all
others
will
have
to
measure
up
to
in
the
dubbel
style
my
only
regret
is
that
i
didnt
try
this
beer
earlier
in
my
life
westvleteren
8
is
one
hell
of
an
incredible
beer
frankly
its
slightly
better
than
the
12
just
my
personal
preference
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
the
nose
is
slightly
weak
other
than
that
this
is
an
extremely
complex
and
excellent
beer
simply
a
must
get
for
any
ba
359
reviews
as
of
this
writing
thanks
to
azurelimits
for
the
chance
to
try
this
fine
beer
since
there
are
so
many
reviews
ill
note
that
i
have
no
idea
of
how
old
this
one
is
for
the
rest
ill
say
wow
this
beer
is
good
thats
the
technical
review
i
am
impressed
at
how
the
westy
yeasts
combined
with
what
i
can
only
imagine
is
a
mineral
water
quality
creates
such
an
amazing
experience
it
is
that
good
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
has
a
chance
to
try
this
fine
beer
this
has
become
my
stranded
island
beer
that
is
the
highest
compliment
i
can
give
it
what
a
great
beer
i
think
i
like
this
better
than
westy
12
this
is
a
superb
beer
and
one
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
im
just
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
unique
and
rare
offering
its
a
really
good
beer
but
i
dont
believe
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
find
too
much
fault
in
the
thin
body
weak
aroma
and
noticeable
alcohol
to
give
it
a
perfect
rating
definitely
a
treat
to
try
in
belgium
though
tasty
and
interesting
quite
smooth
and
dangerously
easy
to
drink
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
flavor
is
mild
and
unified
i
will
drink
more
if
i
can
get
a
hold
of
it
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
belgian
would
be
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
if
it
was
readily
available
westvleteren
8
is
Ô¨Åne
aged
but
its
become
a
bit
too
dry
and
muted
for
our
liking
delicious
fresh
and
arguably
better
than
westvleteren
12
in
drinkability

reminsicent

my
thanks

krkearnyggaughan

joe
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
dubbel
ive
ever
had
and
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
big
thanks
again
to
jason
for
the
opportunity
to
try
all
of
the
westies
wow
i
spent
a
few
bucks
to
buy
this
beer
but
boy
was
it
worth
it
it
poured
amber
very
cloudy
with
lots
of
sediment
the
smell
was
amazing
just
like
any
other
well
crafted
beer
the
taste
was
amazing
the
flavors
meshed
very
well
with
the
overlying
malt
flavors
with
some
nut
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
a
littl
different
from
your
normal
beer
with
all
the
sediment
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
drink
this
all
the
time
wonderfully
complex
and
so
enjoyable
i
could
sip
this
beer
all
night
long
a
phenomenal
dubbel
overall
this
is
another
world
class
beer
from
westvleteren
highly
recommended
d
id
drink
another
if
i
had
one
d
feels
thick
on
the
tongue
but
smooth
drink
this
slowly
and
savor
every
sip
if
youre
fortunate
enough
to
acquire
it
its
like
drinking
the
worlds
greatest
dessert
at
cafe
in
de
vrede
pours
almost
black
with
a
thick
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
after
a
few
sips
the
lacing
iswell
not
even
lacing
more
like
a
sheet
of
foam
clinging
to
all
sides
of
the
glass
held
up
to
a
light
source
the
8
is
a
beautiful
dark
ruby
red
the
nose
is
fantastic
fruitiness
comes
through
first
banana
date
cherries
etc
incredible
malt
too
along
with
lots
of
earthy
and
floral
notes
the
taste
matches
the
richness
and
complexity
of
the
smell
and
then
some
once
again
fruitlike
hints
are
definitely
present
at
first
and
then
give
way
to
dark
complexity
hints
of
spice
hoppiness
at
the
end
quite
sweet
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
another
great
factor
this
is
what
beer
should
feel
likea
thickness
to
it
that
coats
the
mouth
though
its
not
syrupy
good
stuff
drinkability
as
much
as
i
could
see
myself
believing
that
this
beer
is
overhyped
i
surely
tell
you
it
is
not
i
could
definitley
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
but
it
probably
wouldnt
be
practical
nor
very
cost
effective
a
beer
to
savor
and
enjoy
while
relaxing
and
being
able
to
enjoy
the
complexity
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
which
isnt
exactlly
easy
or
cheap
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
obviously
great
beers
im
sad
to
see
my
only
bottle
go
but
im
thrilled
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
i
wasnt
disappointed
at
all
and
to
make
it
even
more
ezciting
i
still
have
a
12
to
drink
anyhow
the
beer
itself
looks
and
smells
excellent
extremely
dark
with
a
tan
head
definite
mix
of
darker
fruits
and
malts
goes
down
extremely
easy
especially
for
a
beer
with
8
alcohol
nicely
carbonated
and
like
its
big
brother
best
enjoyed
at
the
cafe
opposite
the
monastery
for
the
full
experience
fathead
so
i
finally
get
to
try
some
westvleteren
8
and
im
pleasantly
surprised
after
all
the
hype
i
was
sure
i
would
be
fairrly
let
down
even
though
i
had
a
good
experience
with
the
12
i
figured
that
this
beer
would
be
somewhat
ridding
on
the
coattails
of
that
beer
i
was
wrong
the
first
impression
upon
tasting
this
was
wow
this
is
so
fruity
and
lively
it
was
much
brighter
tasting
than
i
expected
extremely
floral
and
with
some
nice
hop
bite
in
the
finish
the
predominant
flavor
seeemed
to
be
honeysuckle
light
and
effervescent
in
the
mouth
this
was
unbelievably
drinkable
and
pleasant
the
pour
was
a
dark
amber
with
little
head
but
the
aromas
immediately
lure
you
in
with
fresh
fruity
and
floral
notes
with
a
bit
of
metal
underneath
really
a
classy
beer
and
if
it
were
more
available
one
that
i
would
probably
drink
more
often
than
the
12
as
much
as
i
love
that
beer
drinkabilitylast
word
highly
drinkable
although
not
as
much
as
the
6
though
still
for
the
style
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
was
more
drinkable
than
this
one
for
me
this
is
certainly
the
new
benchmark
when
it
comes
to
dubbels
as
with
the
12
and
the
6
the
hype
behind
this
beer
is
well
merited
great
drinkability
im
already
sad
this
is
my
only
bottle
def
worthy
of
the
hype
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
everything
you
expect
a
belgian
to
be
and
then
some
amazing
d
so
smooth
and
subtle
its
a
challenge
to
truly
appreciate
it
i
could
pound
it
but
i
know
itd
be
a
sin
wonderful
drinkability
is
moderate
great
flavors
make
for
easy
consumption
but
moderately
high
alcohol
limit
consumption
a
great
beer
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
could
definitely
drink
more
of
these
though
with
8
abv
i
might
limit
myself
to
one
per
occasion
i
was
a
little
skeptical
going
into
this
and
the
first
few
tastes
had
me
wondering
what
the
big
deal
was
now
i
get
it
a
very
nice
beer
but
just
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
it
was
good
but
i
kept
on
thinking
there
should
be
more
to
it
oh
well

did

the

blew
the

away
it
was

a

good

and
made
the
other
seems
boozy
which
they
were
not
definately
worth
holding
on
to
for
a
year
or
two
or
9
d
so
easy
to

its
so
wellbalanced
that
nothing
reaches

drank
this
right
after
i
drank
the
12
and
its
not
quite
as
good
as
the
12
is
but
its
still
a
very
good
beer
my
opinion
of
this
is
the
same
as
it
is
with
the
12
its
not
worth
the
price
to
drink
it
all
the
time
but
its
worth
the
price
to
get
a
couple
bottles
to
try
because
it
is
very
good
and
because
of
the
availability
id
definitely
recommend
this
to
others
to
try
this
is
very
nice
beer
that
is
easy
on
the
palate
and
i
could
drink
a
lot
more
of
if
it
were
more
available
exceptional
highest
recommendation
for
the
belgian
beer
lover
the
rochefort
8
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
holding
up
deeper
and
certainly
has
a
little
more
of
a
punch
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
more
with
the
rochefort
a
little
more
head
a
little
more
lacing
if
somebody
put
a
gun
to
my
head
and
said
choose
i
am
not
sure
which
direction
westy
by
a
nosehair
d
this
is
an
easydrinking
belgian
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
were
it
not
so
rare
i
would
quite
happily
drink
it
frequently
hype
factor
doesnt
live
up
to
it
in
my
book
but
for
me
hyped
beers
rarely
do
maybe
one
of
the
most
drinkable
belgians
ive
had
and
easily
the
best
dubbels
ive
had
i
just
had
the
allagash
dubbel
a
few
days
ago
and
while
a
very
nice
beer
i
found
it
a
bit
lighter
and
not
quite
as
pleasing
i
must
say
however
i
dont
think
with
is
worthy
of
being
considered
a
top
10
in
the
world
beer
now
this
is
a
great
belgian
it
had
miles
of
creamy
tan
head
that
lasted
for
a
couple
minutes
it
reduces
down
to
a
silky
foam
floating
on
the
top
the
beer
itself
was
a
dark
reddish
brown
the
taste
of
sweet
yeast
caramel
does
a
great
job
of
hiding
the
8
alcohol
that
sneaks
up
on
you
the
beer
is
thick
enough
to
cover
your
tongue
with
the
rich
taste
of
heavenly
trappist
ale
you
will
definately
remember
highly
drinkable
will
seek
out
again
i
am
enjoying
this
on
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
with
my
easter
dinner
as
a
tribute
to
the
monks
pours
with
an
offwhite
foamy
mostly
lasting
head
it
has
a
deep
amber
colour
lovely
fruity
aroma
palate
with
notes
of
caramel
raisins
and
roasted
malt
little
sweet
bitter
aftertaste
praise
god
who
inspirited
the
monks
to
create
this
little
miracle
excellent
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
just
might
be
better
than
the
12
imo
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
quite
a
treat
and
an
honor
to
be
my
beer
that
achieves
my
initiate
status
this
is
a
legend
what
else
can
i
say
about
it
poured
into
a
chalice
slightly
murky
deep
coppery
rust
colour
with
a
thin
cap
of
beige
bubbles
decent
head
retention
some
belgian
lace
looks
nice
fruity
bready
aroma
with
notes
of
plum
raisin
crust
faint
alcohol
some
caramel
and
a
hint
of
spice
very
mild
banana
appeared
as
it
warmed
light
alcohol
up
front
along
with
sweet
malts
this
dissolves
into
a
caramel
and
raisin
sweetness
dried
fruit
giving
way
to
malt
and
spicy
alcohol
in
the
finish
bready
malts
linger
on
the
palate
smooth
texture
generous
carbonation
that
feels
light
and
airy
rather
than
aggressive
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
though
the
alcohol
does
makes
itself
known
malt
sweetness
really
started
to
dominate
as
it
warmed
from
just
below
cellar
temperature
a
superbly
balanced
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
any
time
pairs
well
with
most
any
meal
fantastic
example
of
the
style
d
very
tasty
and
the
8
is
nicely
hidden
two
down
one
to
go
this
beer
is
world
class
and
worth
the
premium
paid
on
ebay
i
now
have
to
make
a
journey
to
the
monastery
in
order
to
fully
experience
this
beer
does
it
live
up
to
the
hype
yes
i
cant
wait
for
the
12
i
have
in
the
fridge
the
pour
is
very
dark
brown
with
some
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
head
started
bit
and
fizzy
then
settled
to
around
a
quarter
inch
of
khaki
foam
my
first
impression
of
the
nose
is
cherries
a
touch
of
chocolaty
raisins
some
dusty
yeast
character
very
subtle
flavors
here
light
cherries
banana
chips
roasted
nuts
raisins
hell
lets
just
call
this
liquid
trail
mix
medium
body
high
carbonation
creamy
well
this
is
certainly
a
good
beer
but
it
aint
all
that
taste
is
toasted
amber
malts
with
a
burnt
characteristic
that
mellows
into
a
slight
hop
finish
nice
double
however
not
as
impressive
as
the
12
is
for
a
quad
this
certainly
lived
up
to
expectations
im
trying
to
wait
a
bit
before
enjoying
the
12
but
well
see
how
long
i
can
hold
out
overall
theres
some
interesting
flavors
and
its
no
doubt
well
crafted
but
theres
nothing
really
grabbing
me
here
ill
give
this
a
rereview
if
i
make
my
way
to
belgium
one
of
these
days
but
dont
think
ill
go
to
the
trouble
of
tracking
down
another
bottle
stateside
not
my
favorite
dubbel
soft
and
expansive
textures
seem
to
explode
in
the
mouth
giving
an
airy
robustness
thats
somewhat
firm
and
whimsical
at
the
same
time
but
the
beers
ultimate
dry
and
powdery
warmth
causes
it
to
disolve
on
the
tongue
just
like
cotton
candy
and
when
the
beer
finishes
theres
nothing
there
to
swallow
only
an
impression
of
dry
fruit
and
spice
that
lingers
softly
in
aftertaste
but
easy
on
the
palate
and
stomach
d
as
good
as
i
remember
it
when
i
had
it
in
bottles
at
the
maproom
years
ago
this
is
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
if
someone
told
me
that
from
this
day
on
i
could
drink
only
this
beer
id
say
bring
it
on
my
favorite
beer
on
the
planet
bar
none
had
this
in
a
bottle
imported
from
belgium
to
me
from
a
good
friend
thats
the
kicker
is
the
shipping
cost
on
these
beers
the
trip
to
the
abby
and
the
cost
to
ship
is
extreme
but
the
beer
is
worth
it
light
brown
appearance
with
almost
a
sour
farmhouse
funk
to
it
very
appealing
to
the
palette
easily
drinkable
the
only
problem
was
i
had
1
bottle
the
other
2
busted
in
shipping
but
it
was
a
treat
to
be
able
to
drink
this
rare
beers
indeed
its
caramelized
malty
sweetness
is
well
balanced
by
the
same
peppery
spiciness
suggested
on
the
aroma
and
layer
upon
layer
of
fruit
comes
into
play
warmingly
alcoholic
at
times
it
is
still
quite
well
balanced
and
incredibly
pleasant
d
very
tasty
beer
the
beer
is
somewhat
light
but
full
flavored
great
beer
overall
appearance
is
a
beautiful
rich
clear
deep
brownamberburgundy
very
steady
head
retention
with
low
lacing
the
aroma
is
medium
strength
but
very
consistent
raisin
malt
and
some
alcohol
simple
but
effective
and
good
the
taste
is
nice
warm
and
malty
front
followed
by
a
balanced
fruity
middle
and
finishes
dry
with
subtle
aftertaste
of
caramel
and
some
nutty
chestnut
notes
mouthfeel
is
good
very
mouth
filling
carb
is
nice
in
the
middle
but
not
totally
present
water
is
soft
and
incredibly
drinkable
i
loved
the
taste
this
beer
well
balanced
and
not
too
much
alcohol
taste
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
tint
thick
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
and
somewhat
caramel
with
the
alcohol
becoming
noticeable
as
the
beer
warms
the
taste
is
malty
and
caramel
cherry
flavors
are
noticeable
i
also
picked
up
a
hint
of
chocolate
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
and
suites
the
flavors
this
is
simply
a
delicious
beer
d
so
smooth
and
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
i
dont
think
it
gets
much
better
than
this
thanks
unclejimbo
for
the
longawaited
experience
55f
into
a
tulip
poured
a
bit
lighter
and
with
a
more
aggressive
head
than
the
12
dissipating
head
cratered
from
the
middle
and
left
a
high
lacing
that
looks
like
its
going
to
stick
around
more
spicy
nose
than
big
bro
with
the
expected
candi
syrup
yeast
and
general
dark
earthy
goodness
carbonation
danced
nicely
on
the
sides
of
my
pallete
fanning
the
heavenly
fumes
back
into
my
nose
having
reviewed
the
12
first
i
now
understand
what
it
will
become
after
a
good
bit
of
cellaring
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
has
a
less
cloying
mouthfeel
than
12
but
does
not
carry
the
sublime
messages
to
my
brain
the
fruit
raisiny
slightly
phenolic
notes
are
there
and
make
for
an
intreesting
journey
this
is
a
beer
i
would
serve
to
my
father
in
law
as
my
best
brew
all
in
all
an
excellent
beer
but
not
truly
epic
got
from
belgium
shoppe
earlier
this
year
and
have
been
aging
it
for
special
occasion
so
opened
for
birthday
and
250th
review
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
with
26
08
09
on
the
cap
it
was
a
dark
ruby
color
with
lots
of
yeast
bits
it
had
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
smell
was
sweet
malts
and
dark
fruits
not
very
strong
the
taste
was
even
weaker
almost
watered
down
it
didnt
really
have
any
dominant
traits
and
for
a
dubbel
was
surprisingly
bland
really
had
no
bite
at
all
maybe
something
happened
to
it
during
shipping
but
this
one
is
definitely
overhyped
and
not
worth
the
high
scores
i
got
the
12
in
the
same
shipment
and
it
was
really
good
so
surprised
by
how
bland
this
one
was
will
try
again
during
my
trip
to
belgium
next
year
just
to
be
sure
but
for
now
wont
be
ordering
any
overseas
again
3
na
tie
n
poured
into
a
westmalle
goblet
with
a
good
head
and
great
lacing
i
did
see
a
small
amount
of
dark
yeast
fall
into
the
glass
before
i
could
stop
the
pour
dark
color
almost
like
a
light
american
normal
stout
but
it
lets
a
purplelike
color
come
through
all
over
not
just
the
sides
sweet
malty
and
candy
sugar
tones
waft
into
my
nose
still
smell
a
bitter
flavor
inside
of
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
gives
a
well
carbonated
but
smooth
feel
like
drinking
a
highly
carbonated
popsodacoke
without
the
bite
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
with
spices
and
a
lightly
sweet
cane
sugar
background
very
drinkable
beer
very
enjoyable
overall
if
i
lived
in
belgium
i
would
drink
this
more
often
its
so
good
this
is
my
second
time
having
this
beer
i
bought
2
bottles
around
3
years
ago
i
didnt
review
the
first
bottle
but
i
would
say
this
one
was
much
more
memorable
truly
a
world
class
beer
this
was
the
first
beer
i
have
drank
and
said
to
myself
that
it
was
way
overhyped
i
understand
the
beers
rarity
but
there
is
harder
to
find
beers
out
there
this
is
actually
quite
easy
to
get
now
in
online
auctions
i
much
rather
drink
a
rochefort
or
st
bernardus
especially
for
the
amount
of
money
you
have
to
fork
out
to
get
one
of
these
it
is
a
good
beer
but
does
not
deserve
to
be
in
the
top
five
in
my
honest
opinion
will
try
this
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
i
just
had
a
bad
batch
and
will
update
my
review
if
anything
changes
other
than
that
i
recommend
it
if
you
are
extremely
curious
like
i
was
but
you
will
most
likely
leave
disappointed
after
my
3
disappointing
tastings
of
this
beer
fresh
and
from
different
lots
i
really
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
not
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
ok
1
or
2
bad
beer
can
happen
but
this
taste
and
oxidation
is
just
in
the
beer
and
i
dont
like
it
thanks
to
tpd975
for
supplying
me
with
this
beaut
notes
different
but
nearly
as
good
as
westvleteren
12
this
is
probably
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
with
st
bernardus
coming
fairly
close
i
was
fortunate
to
have
a
friend
in
belgium
pick
this
up
for
me
as
it
demystified
one
the
most
storied
beers
i
had
read
about
in
recent
years
i
shared
it
with
a
good
friend
as
it
poured
majestically
into
a
trappist
glass
to
a
medium
dark
brown
visage
the
muscular
aroma
of
apples
champagne
coffee
came
through
in
the
first
taste
that
was
memorable
it
reminded
me
of
a
darker
version
of
orval
with
the
yeasty
elements
of
westmalle
and
the
medium
body
of
a
bier
d¬ígarde
the
dry
chocolaty
aftertaste
lingered
for
a
long
time
as
the
8
just
capped
a
wonderful
evening
good
drinability
due
to
its
unique
but
awesome
taste
the
peppery
flavors
at
times
sharp
carbonation
and
alcohol
take
it
down
a
couple
notches
but
not
enough
be
any
source
for
compaint
or
even
critique
d
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
would
i
pay
the
same
amount
to
drink
it
again
no
way
highly
recommended
if
you
can
obtain
one
cheers

i
was

disapointed

behind
this

yes
i
have
had
better
dubbels
st
bernys
comes
to
mind
that
said
it
is
very
true
to
the
style
and
a
very
good
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
if
you
can

this
beer
is
fitting
of
the
honor
of
150
cant
wait
for
200
when
i
will
review
the
abyss
decent
drinkable
beer
but
im
disappointed
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
blown
away
not
the
case
time
when
i
hardly
got
a
head
on
the
pour
i
did
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
the
last
time
though
it
was
just
as
great
except
for
the
more
pronounced
bitterness
comment
i
continue
to
be
amazed
at
the
skills
tucked
away
in
far
away
belgium
i
only
wish
i
had
discovered
this
rare
corner
of
the
world
thirty
years
ago
i
only
hope
my
wallet
can
continue
to
afford
me
the
pleasure
of
one
of
the
world¬ís
great
beers
pours
a
super
dark
rich
amber
hue
with
a
big
fluffy
two
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
slowly
dies
down
there
are
some
spots
in
the
head
that
are
darker
than
others
perhaps
some
sediment
i
should
have
let
in
the
bottle
stickiness
is
amazing
holds
on
to
all
sides
of
the
glass
and
doesnt
plan
on
letting
go
smell
is
a
huge
dark
fruit
aroma
of
mainly
dates
plums
and
raisins
theres
also
a
sweet
molasses
scent
mixed
with
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
pears
finally
some
fresh
honey
mixed
with
a
yeasty
scent
and
some
caramel
malt
wow
just
like
its
brother
westy
12
complex
on
the
nose
taste
starts
off
with
a
spicey
sweetness
which
is
followed
by
the
big
caramel
malt
flavor
all
of
those
dark
fruits
as
mentioned
before
come
into
play
again
on
the
tongue
thats
what
i
like
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
how
it
smells
i
also
sense
some
floral
flavors
on
the
tongue
as
well
mouthfeel
is
beyond
perfect
if
thats
possible
so
soft
so
balanced
so
fluffy
so
pure
the
head
lightly
flows
over
the
tongue
so
smoothly
i
think
i
just
had
a
beergasm
i
detect
no
alcohol
anywhere
with
this
brew
if
god
pissed
this
would
come
out
as
much
as
i
loved
the
westy
12
this
easily
beats
it
in
my
opinion
perfect
5
you
better
believe
it
bitches
i
need
more
of
this
stuff
now
greg
hook
a
brother
up
very
complex
and
nicely
balanced
hell
of
a
beer
improves
a
lot
as
it
warms
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
high
but
this
wasnt
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
pours
a
dark
cocoa
color
with
a
creamy
head
the
smell
is
a
raisin
creamy
malt
sweet
sugars
fruity
molasses
its
all
in
there
taste
is
dark
chocolate
rich
malt
cake
type
flavors
like
the
12
with
a
stronger
warming
alcohol
presence
slightly
less
carbonation
than
the
12
one
of
my
fellow
ba
buddies
said
after
his
second
sip
woah
i
could
drink
this
all
day
the
mouth
is
packed
with
flavors
some
fruits
malt
spice
caramel
the
alcohol
sneaks
in
as
it
warms
up
more
and
has
more
flavours
on
the
finish
pepper
and
the
fruits
come
back
to
mind
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
everyday
but
i
am
glad
to
have
two
more
in
my
cellar
they
will
certainly
be
enjoyed
a
gift
from
the
beer
gods
thanks
again
to
my
fellow
anonymous
ba
for
sharing
this
fantastic
beer
man
you
are
excellent
many
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
graciously
sharing
this
rare
example
d
i
really
like
this
brew
a
lot
i
think
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
very
nice
beer
but
not
as
nice
as
the
nose
a
little
burn
in
the
chest
as
well
even
at
8
not
as
complex
as
the
nose
but
big
and
meaty
nonetheless
very
dry
finish
with
a
dried
mixed
berry
end
again
fig
and
white
raisin
with
hints
of
mollasses
and
maple
nice
malty
mid
palate
with
dominating
toffee
and
caramel
dates
and
prune
fill
things
out
and
then
some
more
ripe
flavors
of
cherry
and
red
baked
apple
mouth
is
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
very
good
beer
but
not
as
complex
in
flavor
as
i
anticipated
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
i
had
expected
it
to
be
more
creamy
but
maybe
my
bottle
is
pretty
fresh
and
would
benefit
from
more
aging
quite
honestly
its
currently
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
want
to
drink
a
barrel
of
this
beer
overrated
no
overall
this
is
like
the
12
but
with
a
less
pronounced
alcoholic
aspect
the
8
seemed
a
bit
hoppier
too
great
balance
again
in
depth
strength
and
length
of
flavors
overall
excellent
stuff
thank
you
monks
an
absolute
privilege
to
drink
if
you
can
find
this
beer
take
the
time
necessary
to
enjoy
every
last
drop
blue
cap
brewed
in
2003
and
stamped
best
before
november
122006
savoured
slightly
later
on
may
26
2007
happy
to
report
while
it
may
not
be
at
its
supposed
best
it
was
still
amazing
a
dark
brown
colour
with
big
capping
head
aroma
of
chocolate
covered
raisins
dark
ripe
fruits
plums
grapes
rich
desserts
tiramisu
and
all
sorts
of
things
to
tickle
the
imagination
the
flavour
has
become
or
maybe
always
was
so
incredibly
mellow
notes
of
dates
and
chocolate
covered
raisins
foremost
with
no
indication
of
the
alcohol
and
so
rich
yet
mellowed
this
is
a
beer
you
could
sip
and
enjoy
all
night
tremendous
offering
thanks
again
viggo
drinkability
is
excellent
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
nearly
completely
hidden
its
obvious
that
this
is
a
lighter
version
of
the
12
but
its
very
nice
and
good
in
its
own
way
huge
thanks
go
out
to
eric
for
sharing
this
gem
d
how
does
this
compare
to
all
the
dubbels
in
the
world
or
beers
period
i
dont
know
but
i
do
know
this
is
delicious
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
it
appeals
to
all
the
senses
and
frankly
im
glad
this
one
lived
up
to
the
hype
suffice
to
say
i
look
forward
to
the
next
occasion
to
share
a
bottle
malted
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
up
front
slightly
rummy
fruit
notes
of
raisins
and
figs
develop
dark
candi
sugar
with
a
decidedly
caramel
character
swells
midpalate
perfectly
so
slight
woody
aged
port
quality
near
the
finish
toasty
yeasty
and
warming
with
lingering
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
fullbodied
with
rolling
rollicking
bottleconditioned
carbonation
that
does
a
great
job
of
lifting
the
dark
sugar
sweetness
off
the
palate
would
love
to
have
this
readily
and
easily
available
maybe
the
best
dubbel
i
have
ever
had
an
excellent
beer
and
a
must
try
for
all
advocates
i
think
this
beer
may
be
better
than
the
westy
12
malty
slight
fruit
taste
and
quite
the
big
beer
for
the
lower
alcohol
level
im
sure
this
beer
could
be
aged
for
a
few
years
and
still
be
delicious
medium
sized
head
with
great
lacing
this
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
dark
colour
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
chris
well
done
definitely
an
exceptional
beer
and
one
of
the
best
belgians
ive
tried
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
but
i
probably
wont
be
having
it
again
unless
in
belgium
rather
unimpressed
with
all
the
hype
but
its
still
pretty
good
the
dryness
makes
it
easy
to
drink
despite
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
rather
smooth
with
a
fast
paced
somewhat
aggressive
carbonation
quite
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
almost
too
easily
a
tasty
treat
of
a
brew
and
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
i
still
prefer
the
12
and
im
not
gonna
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
again
considering
the
cost
and
the
trouble
involved
if
i
run
across
it
or
find
myself
in
belgium
than
that
will
be
a
different
story
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
pours
a
fairly
clear
reddish
brown
some
floating
specks
of
sediment
but
nothing
too
severe
tiny
bubbles
float
up
regularly
dense
rocky
ivory
head
the
last
bit
of
the
bottle
pours
like
molten
chocolate
considerably
darkening
up
the
beer
making
it
entirely
opaque
aroma
is
rich
with
gentle
complexity
coming
across

medium
bodied
rather
sprightly
on
the
palate
very
rounded
in
texture
providing
a
full
experience
nutty
overall
the
chocolate
flavor
blending
masterfully
with
the
yeasty
characteristics
some
aged
flavors
mostly
dusted
papery
honey
works
very
well
with
the
nutty
hazelnut
and
almond
taste
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
the
12
excellent
this
bottle
was
labeled
best
before
6809
american
style
and
we
drank
it
on
33107
to
celebrate
my
girlfriends
birthday
i
poured
it
into
a
chimay
goblet
and
served
it
at
around
51
degf
it
has
a
thick
off
white
head
that
sits
atop
a
very
dark
brown
body
its
not
black
like
a
stout
but
light
doesnt
get
through
the
sides
either
its
kind
of
weird
like
that
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
but
it
isnt
very
strong
the
taste
is
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
granted
my
expectations
were
very
high
and
it
still
is
a
good
beer
it
is
very
malty
and
sweet
with
some
dark
fruits
in
there
but
there
is
a
slight
bite
from
something
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
dead
on
perfect
full
bodied
creaminess
the
drinkability
is
also
pretty
high
although
i
do
prefer
the
12
to
this
deep
brown
in
colorhuge
fluffy
tan
head
slight
aroma
of
raisens
and
dried
fruits
solid
malty
flavortrace
of
roasted
malt
again
with
the
dried
fruits
moderate
level
of
candy
like
sweetness
at
times
high
level
of
carbonation
makes
it
very
bright
on
the
tongue
quite
dry
in
the
finish
overall
a
good
beer
i
think
i
preferred
the
12
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
and
at
a
better
price
to
really
form
a
solid
opinion
poured
out
a
caramel
brown
color
murky
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
the
nose
has
some
toffee
sweetness
strawberry
hickory
mollasses
bbq
caramel
banana
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
bananas
anise
chocolate
caramel
alcohol
and
yeast
the
mouthfeel
had
some
tight
prickly
carbonation
theres
a
bit
of
cloying
to
an
otherwise
spectacular
finish
my
overall
impression
is
that
althought
this
is
an
amazing
beer
its
riding
the
cotails
of
the
12
to
its
high
rating
poured
from
a
bottle
handcarried
back
from
the
abbey
aged
1
12
years
it
is
a
very
cloudy
orangetined
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
comprised
of
microscopic
bubbles
that
create
a
light
tan
head
leave
beautiful
lacing
smells
of
oranges
plums
and
spices
nutmeg
cloves
it
also
has
a
hint
of
dark
maple
syrup
lurking
in
the
background
the
taste
goes
through
more
changes
than
i
can
count
dry
cocoa
gives
way
to
dark
fruits
rum
soaked
oranges
and
plums
then
a
nuttiness
that
melds
into
an
oak
aftertaste
and
then
a
finish
like
brown
sugar
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
smooth
substantial
and
lovely
a
bit
drier
at
then
end
than
id
like
if
im
splitting
hairs
from
split
hairs
the
drinkability
is
phenomenal
with
a
warmth
that
blooms
from
the
alcohol
but
not
a
hint
of
any
harshness
in
fact
the
smooth
melded
flavors
are
the
only
thing
that
linger
and
they
beg
to
be
repeated
seriously
this
ones
drinkability
is
only
limited
by
the
lengths
to
which
you
have
to
go
to
get
it
if
you
can
get
it
overall
thank
you
so
much
himerman
for
this
unexpected
but
definately
apreciated
beer
it
was
everything
i
expected
and
more
the
feel
on
this
is
extrodinary
so
alive
it
literally
is
popping
in
your
mouth
as
you
sip
so
smooth
and
the
taste
just
lingers
for
what
seems
like
an
eternity
simply
wonderful
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
up
just
at
the
least
to
see
if
it
lived
upto
the
hype
and
it
does
i
cannot
begin
to
imagine
what
the
12
must
be
like
the
one
in
my
fridge
will
let
me
know
soon
enough
scores
high
for
me
with
a
perfect
interaction
behind
the
yeast
and
malt
traditions
of
a
strong
belgum
ale
like
the
palate
with
a
smooth
delivery
but
not
soft
and
meaningless
tones
of
chocolate
caramel
and
you
name
the
fuit
are
a
nice
dry
complement
to
a
beer
that
continues
to
deliver
in
wide
temperature
range
an
absolute
top
50
beer
drinkability
is
about
as
perfect
as
a
beer
gets
this
without
a
doubt
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
truly
world
class
i
have
had
the
12
on
two
occasions
and
still
think
i
prefer
the
8
i
will
truly
miss
having
this
beer
on
hand
poured
from
my
bottle
to
my
snifter
a
dark
reddishbrown
and
unable
to
see
through
with
a
large
tan
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lace
around
the
glass
smell
has
some
fruity
notes
and
the
taste
is
very
rich
and
complex
with
somewhat
dried
fruit
flavors
of
raisin
and
prune
and
a
touch
of
carbonation
this
is
one
excellently
crafted
beer
and
is
highly
drinkable
but
only
having
one
small
bottle
of
this
brew
is
not
nearly
enough
time
to
explore
the
complexity
of
this
beer
drinkability
i
am
going
to
go
as
far
as
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
i
am
so
happy
that
i
came
across
this
gem
and
i
can¬ít
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
this
again
creamy
luscious
delicious
yes
delicioius
a
very
broad
word
used
to
describe
something
very
few
things
in
life
can
simply
be
described
as
delicious
this
is
one
of
those
special
things
overall
an
exquisite
example
of
the
style
not
just
worth
seeking
out
for
its
reputation
but
worth
seeking
out
if
only
to
have
a
dubbel
like
youve
never
had
before
if
you
see
it
trample
everyone
between
you
and
this
brew
youll
thank
me
d
no
doubt
about
it
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
a
bit
lacking
in
aroma
but
the
complexities
of
the
flavor
make
up
for
it
i
probably
wont
get
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
again
but
if
the
opportunity
is
there
il
gladly
take
it
used
a
chalice
for
this
one
as
it
deserves

awhile
leaves
some
nice
islands
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose

sweet
malts
yeast
grapes
figs
raisins
slight

the
taste
is
absolutely
delicious

and
grapes
very
tangy
a
nice
touch

fizzy
on
the

it
goes

50
wish
i
could
have
more
big
un¬ís
when
i
get
to
enjoy
brews
like
this
velvetty
smooth
mouthfeel
with
an
overwhelming
sensation
of
rich
ripe
fruit
that
only
intensifies
in
sweetness
as
this
liquid
gold
warms
upon
the
tongue
when
aerated
across
the
tongue
sherry
notes
burst
forth
along
with
some
subtle
tinges
of
chocolate
this
is
fantasticly
complex
and
perhaps
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
grace
my
lips
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
consists
of
bready
malt
cherrries
yeast
spice
and
brandy
the
taste
in
one
word
incredible
there
is
a
really
nice
malty
base
that
supports
some
dark
fruits
and
a
little
chocolate
the
taste
finishes
with
a
slightly
spicey
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
creamy
overall
this
is
truely
one
of
the
finest
beers
on
the
planet
it
definately
gets
better
as
it
warms
so
give
it
time
to
sit
out
before
serving
if
serving
cold
out
of
the
fridge
this
beer
deserves
all
the
hype
and
then
some
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
has
so
much
to
say
i
wish
it
would
say
hey
im
cheap
and
readily
available
this
one
also
was
sent
to
me
by
ba
dogfooddog
and
had
a
best
by
date
of
18
feb
2008
making
this
a
little
shy
of
two
year
old
the
beer
poured
murky
orange
brown
in
color
and
was
topped
with
a
three
finger
tall
head
that
simply
refused
to
die
needless
to
say
the
lacing
was
pretty
solid
around
the
entire
goblet
aroma
was
quite
a
bit
superior
to
most
other
dubbles
which
typically
underwhelm
me
with
their
yeast
driven
smell
this
one
seemed
much
brighter
and
fruity
in
comparison
the
yeast
was
certainly
detectable
in
a
dusty
undercurrent
but
the
overall
smell
was
not
dominated
by
it
the
taste
was
sweet
sour
bitter
and
spicy
but
not
complex
enough
to
detract
from
the
drinkability
the
primary
flavor
impression
was
that
of
dried
cherries
with
a
light
coating
of
chocolate
there
was
spicy
bite
to
the
flavor
and
surprisingly
there
seemed
to
a
clean
bitterness
in
the
dry
finish
not
a
hint
of
the
8
abv
to
be
found
at
all
a
superlative
dubbel
which
has
forever
ruined
the
other
more
typical
examples
of
the
style
for
me
notes
id
go
as
far
as
saying
that
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
planet
truly
a
masterpiece
33
cl
bottle
shared
by
the
house
wine
lover
himself
i
must
admit
that
before
we
even
tried
this
one
we
seriously
considered
dumping
this
out
and
in
its
place
pouring
fuller¬ís
london
porter
mixed
with
vodka
to
create
a
clone
then
we
had
an
even
better
idea
why
not
buy
a
bottle
of
la
terrible
and
add
water
to
it
to
bring
the
abv
down
wouldn¬ít
it
be
the
same
thing
deep
chestnut
pours
and
emits
a
thin
tight
bubbled
beige
skin
apples
plums
prunes
fig
pear
and
orages
give
way
to
spices
cinnamon
and
a
mildly
smoky
malt
with
subtle
hops
ohh
my
very
fruity
flavours
that
pretty
much
mimic
the
aroma
nutmeg
and
other
spices
very
earthy
and
full
dry
flavourful
lingering
finish
yes
i
like
it
thanks
mr
s
very
complex
as
the
proper
temperature
is
everything
with
this
beer
i
may
have
started
with
this
one
a
little
too
cold
but
it
really
gets
better
as
it
warms
very
drinkable
but
too
rare
big
full
flavored
creamy
brew
tastes
changed
as
i
sipped
and
it
warmed
at
times
it
was
just
about
everything
spicey
sweet
peppery
well
worth
having
several
and
very
nice
pours
a
ruddy
brown
color
and
murky
with
a
large
tan
head
that
barely
budges
aroma
is
very
light
and
has
traces
of
ripe
fruit
sweet
caramel
malt
and
belgian
sugars
a
little
bubblegummy
taste
shows
some
of
the
sweet
candy
sugar
and
fruit
flavor
up
front
along
with
a
little
rich
tobacco
like
flavor
these
are
cut
mid
taste
by
a
small
roasty
twang
and
a
decent
pepperiness
there
is
some
alcohol
flavor
and
some
tingly
carbonation
along
with
the
pepper
and
then
a
decently
dry
finish
this
beer
improved
vastly
as
it
approached
room
temp
the
aroma
and
taste
were
very
subtle
and
only
when
it
became
fairly
warm
did
the
flavors
start
to
come
out
still
were
subtle
but
a
nice
drinkable
beer
great
mouthfeel
okay
heres
the
deal
when
i
first
poured
this
it
was
too
cold
all
the
intensity
remained
but
it
was
confined
like
seventeen
pitbulls
in
a
shoebox
it
was
confined
now
thats
its
warmed
the
big
fruit
yeast
of
the
nose
comes
in
at
the
start
wonderfully
sweet
and
balanced
perfectly
against
a
dryly
sweet
malt
middle
and
a
kick
of
honest
to
god
hops
drinkability
hands
down
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
i
finished
off
this
bottle
in
no
time
each
sip
leaves
you
yearning
for
another
damn
near
perfect
brew
d
quite
good
considering
the
strength
it
is
quite
obvious
that
lots
of
care
and
skill
went
into
the
making
of
this
perfectly
balanced
ale
simply
the
very
definition
of
the
style
worth
seeking
out
cheers
d
i
want
another
but
i
assume
thats
the
usual
feeling
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
12
drinkability
goes
down
easily
except
that
you
are
continually
grasping
to
identify
the
complex
flavors
very
drinkable
if
you
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
enough
to
consume
inquantity
jebus
this
masterpiece
has
everything
going
for
it
heavanly
mouthfeel
perfect
balance
and
an
impossibly
light
dry
finish
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
giving
this
a
perfect
5
is
probably
the
same
thing
that
keeps
quadrupels
and
imperial
stouts
at
the
top
of
the
best
of
ba
list
8
abv
is
nothing
to
play
with
this
is
a
strong
ale
but
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
kick
your
ass
wow
factor
of
the
biggest
and
strongest
having
said
that
this
is
probably
more
drinkable
and
a
better
everyday
beer
than
the
much
stronger
ales
opinion
what
can
i
say
about
such
an
outstanding
beer
this
is
fabulous
as
i
drink
this
beer
for
a
while
and
i
am
taking
my
time
with
it
i
can
see
how
there
is
often
a
comparison
made
between
this
and
rochefort
this
beer
does
taste
a
bit
like
their
8
with
all
of
its
fruity
complexity
and
full
flavor
while
still
coming
across
as
well
attenuated
and
drinkable
i
think
that
rochefort
is
a
bit
more
dark
malt
driven
which
gives
it
a
tad
more
acidity
this
beer
is
a
bit
more
fruity
but
both
are
dangerously
drinkable
for
such
strong
beers
pours
a
dark
ruby

quickly
filled

even
a
bit
of
chocolate
taste
hits
strong
up
front
with
fruity
sweetness
and
rounds
out
with
the
dessert
flavors
mouthfeel
is
impecable
thick
yet
effervescent
and
tingling
highly
drinkable

from
the
difficulty
to
acquire

quite
vinous
with
a
bit
of
green
apple
sourness
lots
of
caramel
and
some
chocolate
surfaced
as
it
warmed
taste
was
a
roller
coaster
of
flavour
an
absolutely
amazing
ride
candy

sweetness
and
green
apples
up
front
changing
to
caramel
and
chocolate
maltiness
changing
again
to
a
mild
bittersweet
chocolate
peppery
finish
mouthfeel
was
amazingly
smooth
and
not
too
heavy
the
body
of
a
red
wine
in
a
way
this
is
very
drinkable
and
the
flavour
is
amazing
definitely
something
to
track
down
now
im
just
waiting
for
another
special
occassion
to
crack
open
my
first
12
i
can
respect
this
brew
and
ill
definitely
give
it
a
shot
again
once
i
age
it
for
a
good
while
a
bit
hyped
sure
but
im
not
totally
against
it

and
alcohol
memory
in
the
mouth
an
excellent
dubbel
in
every
respect
the
best
of
the
type
ive
tried
thus
far
d
balanced
and
quite
good
but
this
isnt
the
7
beer
in
the
world
creamy
and
soft
but
not
too
thick
goes
down
very
smoothly
along
with
the
rochefort
10
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
tried
after
this
i
cant
wait
to
try
its
big
brother
drinkabitly
of
this
beer
is
great
i
expect
it
to
improve
with
some
more
age
under
it
d
drinkability
is
exceptional
what
a
wonderful
complex
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
yet
definitely
believe
the
hype
on
this
one
a
special
thanks
to
xcjetta
who
sent
me
this
beer
as
part
of
secret
santa
05
i
have
been
looking
at
it
for
almost
9
months
it
was
worth
the
wait
finishes
with
a
medium
to
strong
vineosity
with
a
drying
cocoa
note
and
smooth
warming
on
the
throat
teh
flavor
was
supprisingly
light
though
it
had
a
gerat
mouthfeel
full
bodied
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
it
had
a
malty
body
with
a
slightly
tart
finish
and
some
hints
of
alcohol
at
teh
very
end
thi
beer
put
up
a
great
appearance
butt
eh
flavor
and
aroma
somewhat
left
me
feeling
let
down
it
was
still
quite
a
good
beer
and
very
drnkable
and
i
would
drink
it
again
beautiful
mahogany
body
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
with
nice
lacing
smell
is
dark
fruity
maybe
plums
and
caramel
sugar
taste
is
so
clean
and
smooth
it
all
comes
together
in
this
brew
i
cant
think
of
how
i
could
make
this
beer
taste
any
better
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
expected
and
incredibly
smooth
carbonation
is
almost
creamy
microscopic
bubbles
well
hidden
alcohol
makes
drinkability
outstanding
sounds
like
a
spikey
exotic
toosweet
beer
right
its
not
its
purely
a
wellcrafted
highlydrinkable
superenjoyable
indulgence
for
lovers
of
prime
belgian
beercraft
too
bad
the
monks
wont
let
us
enjoy
this
more
often
i
respect
their
ways
but
then
again
if
youve
got
a
great
thing
going
let
the
world
in
on
it
no
all
the
flavors
come
across
as
flat
and
lifeless
there
is
a
cherry
and
grape
flavor
but
very
subdued
caramel
and
molasses
toobut
like
theyve
been
in
the
cupboard
for
years
brown
sugar
but
as
if
it
was
mixed
and
diluted
with
water
medium
body
with
some
slight
heat
from
the
alcohol
kind
of
tangy
alright
for
what
it
is
but
not
sure
i
understand
how
it
has
scored
so
high
nice
creamy
and
full
mouthfeel
still
has
some
carbonation
after
3
years
the
finish
is
divine
and
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
particularly
considering
the
abv
if
it
were
even
the
least
bit
more
easily
accessable
or
cheap
i
would
probably
acquire
more
i
cant
wait
to
finally
travel
to
europe
overall
a
very
good
and
wellbalanced
beer
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
rich
and
deliciously
heavenly
md
the
mouthfeel
is
superbly
creamy
and
silky
smooth
matching
the
soft
body
just
perfectly
for
all
the
dubbelstyle
ales
ive
tasted
this
is
by
far
the
most
smooth
example
yet
showing
impressive
complexity
and
really
great
flavours
this
is
not
a
big
beer
to
make
drinkers
feel
small
but
a
beer
to
lift
up
both
their
souls
and
sensations
in
a
subtle
manner
having
tried
it
at
last
i
think
ill
keep
my
original
bottle
purchased
in
brussels
for
several
more
years
im
sure
itll
be
even
more
mature
through
the
test
of
time
cap
dated

probably
the
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
silentsabre
this
beer
poured
an
opaque
brown
color
with
creamy
light
brown
foam
that
was
slow
to
settle
and
clung
to
the
glass
coating
it
the
smell
was
modest
but
some
malt
came
through
the
taste
was
fruity
and
vinous
almost
like
blueberries
the
light
fruitiness
was
up
front
but
the
finish
was
dry
with
some
hops
coming
through
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
overall
with
medium
body
and
strong
carbonation
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
this
was
a
very
nice
bottle
and
probably
the
freshest
i
have
had
this
beer
the
only
weak
point
was
the
aroma
with
everything
this
beer
has
going
for
it
the
drinkablity
is
a
five
no
doubt
about
that
again
im
in
awe
of
what
the
brothers
can
do
its
no
12
but
its
a
solid
beer
wrapped
in
an
exquisite
package
worth
a
try
glad
i
did
the
appearance
is
dark
with
a
little
light
shinning
through
the
aromas
are
fruity
and
fruity
that
is
all
you
smell
at
a
young
age
this
is
a
excellent
beer
but
age
it
atleast
a
year
to
enhance
the
flavors
at
the
young
age
it
has
a
good
fruity
flavor
but
after
a
year
this
flavor
is
unbelievable
i
first
thought
that
it
was
not
worth
the
drive
across
belgium
but
now
after
tasting
a
couple
more
cant
wait
to
go
back
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
an
abundance
of
flavor
the
only
thing
i
marked
it
down
on
was
the
drinkability
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
packed
full
of
flavors
to
much
of
this
wonderful
brew
and
you
will
give
yourself
a
headache
enjoying
every
sip
but
it
is
the
only
way
to
drink
this
beer
enjoy
i
had
that
beer
in
my
cellar
since
a
year
in
a
half
waiting
to
drink
it
i
guess
i
was
disapointed
i
was
waiting
for
the
holy
grail
a
very
good
beer
not
a
great
one
to
jump
out
of
building
tho
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
more
tart
almost
sour
apples
in
the
flavor
bready
malts
and
a
crisp
dry
champagnelike
feel
alcohol
and
sour
in
the
finish
which
is
a
touch
unpleasant
surprisingly
straightforward
as
ive
come
to
expect
a
lot
more
complexity
from
the
trappists
then
again
i
far
prefer
the
rochefort
10
to
the
8
or
6
maybe
the
westvleteren
12
will
also
far
exceed
its
lesser
brethren
the
bloodhound
factor
yes
i
shared
this
heavenly
brew
with
my
angelic
pups
they
both
were
thrilled
with
it
even
though
they
got
little
more
than
a
cap
ful
bottle
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
light
tan
and
fizzy
head
the
head
lasts
a
good
while
but
doesn¬ít
lace
all
that
well
aroma¬ís
are
sweet
with
touches
of
raisins
plums
and
a
touch
of
cherry
has
a
strong
alcohol
presence
taste
is
very
refined
with
a
great
mix
this
is
not
real
sweet
or
bitter
or
malty
just
has
a
pure
beer
taste
a
very
crisp
refreshing
beer
no
real
noticable
aftertaste
but
it
has
a
solid
duration
definately
as
good
as
advertised
i
think
that
i
might
just
like
this
one
a
touch
more
than
the
12
the
8
has
lighter
aromas
and
flavors
a
softer
body
and
a
lighter
palate
the
reduced
alcohol
gives
the
beer
a
less
vinous
character
which
allows
more
delicate
components
of
the
nose
and
tongue
to
shine
through
this
is
certainly
more
subtle
but
i
don¬ít
think
it¬ís
lacking
anything
significant
on
the
12
it¬ís
just
a
different
beer
one
item
that
i
must
note
is
the
body
in
addition
to
being
generally
softer
the
8
seems
to
be
considerably
more
bubbly
the
head
is
slightly
more
aggressive
on
the
lips
and
tongue
and
the
more
assertive
carbonation
seems
to
do
a
better
job
of
cleansing
the
palate
between
sips
each
next
sip
is
therefore
closer
resembling
the
original
full
flavored
mind
blowing
sip
i
like
this
about
the
beer
i
also
like
that
it
looks
tastes
and
smells
just
uncannily
good
and
also
that
it¬ís
damn
near
impossible
to
find
what
a
treat
it
is
and
well
worth
every
penny
or
couple
thousand
pennies
that
one
must
drop
to
get
a
bottle
bottom
line
this
is
one
classy
and
classic
brew
if
you
ever
see
some
around
your
neck
of
the
woods
do
not
fail
to
grab
some
and
if
you
cant
find
any
locally
try
your
best
to
arrange
for
a
trade
or
buy
some
online
its
too
good
to
miss
out
on
body
is
right
between
medium
and
large
with
a
chewy
sticky
mouthfeel
and
creamy
soft
texture
nectar
of
the
gods
this
is
poured
a
deep
brownishred
color
with
chunky
slightly
offwhite
head
little
retention
but
nice
subtle
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
absolutely
fantastic
being
a
nice
combination
of
dark
fruits
raisins
prunes
figs
dates
tart
apples
and
wine
very
unique
and
supremely
enjoyable
the
taste
is
a
culmination
of
the
promise
of
the
smell
what
a
mixture
of
spiciness
fruitiness
and
toasty
malt
it
virtually
dances
in
the
mouth
finish
is
so
smooth
that
its
difficult
to
believe
there
is
8
alcohol
in
it
some
winelike
flavors
come
through
at
the
end
easy
to
drink
will
try
to
find
another
bottle
some
time
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
like
to
have
another
of
really
soon
i
think
i
will
drinkability
by
far
the
most
flavorful
dubbel
i
have
tried
i
usually
am
not
really
a
fan
of
dubbels
but
this
one
i
would
gladly
drink
all
the
time
if
it
was
readily
available
highly
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
and
leaves
a
12in
tan
head
the
smell
is
sweet
fruits
figs
plums
grape
juice
and
honey
as
i
tasted
this
beer
all
the
previous
fruit
flavors
come
out
this
has
a
great
malty
taste
on
the
palate
and
is
really
smooth
as
i
let
this
beer
continue
to
warm
up
i
can
really
begin
to
smell
and
taste
more
of
the
fruitiness
as
well
as
the
honey
and
cloves
and
it
just
compliments
each
other
so
well
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
is
well
crafted
and
would
pair
well
with
some
smoked
gouda
or
any
antipasto
dish
to
really
contrast
against
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
drinkability
high
alcohol
inhibits
session
drinkability
but
the
brew
is
delicious
not
as
good
as
the
12
but
close
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
dubbel
would
most
likely
be
a
good
beer
to
cellar
and
let
its
character
come
through
glad
i
have
some
more
drinkability
is
very
high
all
dubbels
should
be
this
graceful
yet
powerful
still
the
standard
bearer
for
the
style
an
entirely
worthy
beer
for
my
100th
review
i
just
hope
my
review
is
worthy
of
the
beer
a
shame
this
cant
be
legally
purchased
in
the
us
anymore
overall
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
ranked
as
the
number
5
beer
in
the
world
i
had
quite
high
expectations
as
good
as
this
was
i
was
still
hoping
for
a
little
more
i
have
two
more
that
ill
have
over
the
next
two
years
this
brew
is
prime
for
maturation
pours
a
very
deep
brown
color
with
ruby
hues
a
two
finger
head
sits
over
top
and
falls
to
a
finger
the
nose
is
brown
sugary
and
even
slightly
mapellike
sweet
dark
fruits
with
puffs
of
alcohol
abound
i
even
get
a
touch
of
cherry
in
there
too
very
nice
flavor
is
oh
so
nice
a
ton
going
on
here
light
dark
fruits
caramel
brown
sugar
slightly
creamy
shit
so
smooth
this
may
be
the
best
brew
i
have
had
hands
down
the
feel
is
velvet
smooth
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
its
moderate
in
thickness
i
could
sit
and
drink
this
brew
all
damn
day
no
hint
anywhere
of
the
8
everything
moves
seamlessly
into
each
other
in
the
flavor
aroma
and
mouthfeel
divine
absolutely
divine

a
very
murkey
iced

lots
of
fine

settles
in
a
ring
around
the

is
very

dark

some

a
rich

just
slides
down
your

excellent
beer
as
good
in
its
own
ways
as
westy
12
and
im
glad
i
have
another
bottles
kicking
around
d
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
in
the
smell
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
same
complexity
in
the
taste
very
nice
beer
notes
this
was
the
first
time
i
tried
westvleteren
8
i
set
up
a
sidebyside
comparison
with
st
bernardus
prior
8
served
in
another
watou
chalice
from
an
11
2
oz
bottle
the
prior
8
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
since
i
first
tried
it
last
december
now
i
can
happily
say
that
i
think
it
is
marginally
better
than
westvleteren
in
my
opinion
they
are
both
exceptional
but
the
alcohol
was
just
more
present
in
the
westvleteren
flavor
than
i
would
prefer
the
st
bernardus
seemed
a
little
richer
in
malt
flavor
also
pours
a
dark
brown
slightly
crimson
color
with
a
tan
creamy
looking
head
and
some
lacing
smells
mostly
of
raisins
a
sweet
and
lightly
floral
backgrounds
as
it
warms
i
get
more
powerful
raisiny
smells
taste
is
also
quite
raisiny
with
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
toffee
a
stouty
type
thing
going
on
very
dry
cant
sense
the
alcohol
at
all
very
sneaky
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
chewy
and
frothy
very
nice
drinkable
sure
to
some
extent
but
i
find
theres
something
in
there
that
would
prevent
me
from
being
able
to
have
a
few
of
these
a
solid
beer
to
be
sure
but
i
hope
i
can
get
another
one
and
hold
on
to
it
for
a
few
years
the
taste
is
much
more
dry
than
the
smell
indicates
though
there
is
a
sweetness
like
sweetend
coffee
perhaps
coffee
with
a
splash
of
raisin
syrup
theres
also
a
stoutycoffee
like
thing
in
the
mouthfeel
cant
really
detect
the
alcohol
in
the
flavor
though
i
imagine
it
serves
to
liven
up
flavors
very
complex
this
isnt
my
favorite
dubbel
out
there
but
its
nothing
to
sneeze
at
conclusion
very
dubbellike
in
character
its
a
good
and
solid
beer
but
world
class
meh
a
very
drinkable
brew
youd
guess
it
was
only
5
abv
these
people
obviously
know
what
theyre
doing
respect
final
thoughts
an
excellent
brew
but
dont
fall
prey
to
you
cant
find
it
it
is
sooo
good
there
are
other
dubbels
out
there
that
will
keep
you
happy
a
shame
that
it
cost
so
much
as
i
would
have
loved
to
drink
the
2nd
bottle
but
ill
save
it
for
a
little
cellaring
and
drinking
later
fantastic
i
prefer
this
over
the
12
actually
superb
drinkability
well
damn
hard
to
find
and
a
little
too
rich
for
session
drinking
but
would
i
have
another
if
the
opportunity
arose
hell
yes
i
would
buy
again
if
i
saw
it
for
sure
raisin
brown
with
a
thin
dingy
beige
head
that
coats
the
beer
to
the
end
aroma
is
of
fruity
esters
vinous
sugary
sweetness
and
tart
green
apples
nice
rich
caramel
sweetness
that
grows
as
the
beer
warms
the
nose
is
infinitely
complex
with
various
intertwining
aromas
grainy
and
grassy
malt
flavor
with
a
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
but
not
as
much
as
in
the
nose
some
spicy
peppery
hops
mixed
with
some
tarness
and
a
very
soft
lingering
vinous
quality
that
is
especially
evident
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
pleasant
with
some
mild
carbonation
tickle
overall
vinous
and
dry
a
little
sweetness
could
go
a
long
way
as
i
did
westvleteren
12
as
a
landmark
beer
so
am
i
doing
westy
8
as
review
700
i
bought
this
almost
a
year
ago
so
its
had
a
good
year
to
age
a
bit
and
i
like
the
results
as
a
nice
dubbel
this
is
a
fine
one
with
a
good
plumlike
sweetness
in
the
body
thats
just
barely
touched
by
hops
and
a
candi
sugar
sweetness
and
a
tartness
that
completes
the
complexity
of
the
beer
quite
nice
a
fine
beer
and
now
that
the
flow
of
these
bottles
are
slowing
down
a
bit
im
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
have
this
before
westvleteren
is
cut
off
to
the
us
taste
starts
with
alcohol
damn
and
i
cellared
this
in
hopes
of
clearing
that
up
a
bit
that
settles
to
caramel
and
toffee
some
phenolic
funk
appropriate
for
the
style
but
yuck
i
dont
like
funk
fortunately
the
funk
is
covered
pretty
well
by
candisugar
licorice
and
black
anise
beneath
and
a
still
present
gentle
alcohol
burn
what
a
great
aftertaste
yummy
chocolate
that
settles
to
a
delicate
alcohol
prickle
on
the
back
of
my
and
and
far
back
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
more
tastes
reveal
not
quite
a
molasses
but
more
of
a
brown
sugar
alcohol
mixed
with
this
has
a
sort
of
brandy
character
mdthick
body
and
a
bit
overcarbonated
purply
brown
cloudy
opaque
dubbel
with
a
monster
head
and
lots
o
lacing
smell
especially
as
the
beer
warms
is
a
heady
complex
mixture
of
fruit
pear
raisin
and
some
banana
and
belgian
yeast
and
malts
it
was
a
shame
to
consume
it
and
lose
that
aroma
taste
is
mellow
fruity
candi
mix
of
bubbly
goodness
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
and
very
satisfying
if
this
beer
were
reasonably
available
and
reasonably
priced
it
would
be
a
permanent
fixture
in
the
household
very
drinkable
worth
the
cost
yeah
sure
how
wonderful
that
such
a
little
piece
of
belgian
culture
can
find
its
way
all
the
back
to
alaska
and
be
enjoyed
with
almost
as
much
splendor
as
when
it
was
had
at
de
vrede
but
in
any
case
two
great
beers
over
the
last
serveral
months
my
tastes
have
changed
my
nose
has
yet
to
pick
up
all
that
passes
it
and
my
palate
follows
suit
but
overall
this
beer
is
sheer
nirvana
there
are
some
just
as
good
the
rochfort
8
which
i
am
openning
now
may
be
one
of
them
the
unibrue
11
which
i
finished
earlier
is
close
with
its
hit
of
plum
but
this
beer
is
a
punch
in
the
mouth
and
all
i
can
say
is
how
on
earth
do
they
do
it
enough
has
been
written
about
each
of
our
experiences
our
tastes
overall
i
get
plum
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
like
plum
wine
yet
subtle
nice
bubbles
with
a
short
creamy
head
a
very
very
subtle
brandy
aroma
and
somthing
sweet
that
stays
on
my
palate
like
syrup
delicious
beer
may
i
have
another
please
drinkability
is
fantastic
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
obtained
this
thru
a
trade
along
with
the
12
this
is
the
1st
one
ive
tried
and
well
worth
it
excellent
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
¬ñ
alive
with
a
rich
dark
red
color
and
a
wonderful
nose
that
makes
your
mouth
water
on
the
pour
it
left
a
dark
dollop
in
the
center
of
sediment
oh
what
a
great
first
taste
¬ñ
so
silky
like
it
was
on
nitrogen
the
alcohol
is
clear
and
present
and
leaves
a
lasting
burn
as
the
sweet
honey
bitter
chocolate
and
dry
hop
flavors
linger
on
your
palate
this
beer
is
a
world
class
and
fully
satisfying
in
one
glass
block
out
an
hour
of
your
life
and
enjoy
get
it
at
jacksons
in
lafayette
medium
bodied
and
quite
dry
very
drinkable
drinkability
and
overall
well
wouldnt
you
know
it
this
is
damn
near
as
good
as
the
12
if
not
better
its
smoother
and
more
balanced
while
not
quite
as
complex
this
beer
is
truly
one
of
the
worlds
best
westvletern
is
the
best
of
the
trappist
breweries
ive
tried
the
balance
and
complexity
they
achieve
is
unmatched
by
any
other
beer
on
the
market
this
is
a
remarkably
smooth
tasty
complex
and
delicate
beer
that
is
perfect
for
any
occassion
one
of
the
worlds
best
cheers
beertracker
a
dark
rich
malty
strong
ale
drink
what
you
will
saver
the
rest
enjoy
thoroughly
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
while
for
some
reason
since
having
other
dubbels
recently
i
decided
to
see
how
this
stacked
up
the
pours
out
a
dark
ruddy
brown
with
a
few
bits
of
sediment
floating
about
about
an
inch
of
frothy
tan
head
foams
on
tap
that
stays
for
some
time
leaving
little
bits
of
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
is
strong
with
rip
dark
fruits
and
an
underlying
sweetness
there
is
a
bit
of
candy
like
sugar
to
it
and
a
good
amount
of
spice
very
appetizing
aroma
you
could
sit
and
sniff
for
awhile
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
sugar
start
off
the
flavor
a
bit
hit
of
dark
fruitiness
really
carries
the
taste
a
nice
variety
of
spice
it
there
as
well
this
ends
on
a
spicy
fruity
note
very
flavorful
and
not
to
sweet
just
about
full
bodies
this
is
as
smooth
and
creamy
as
it
gets
simply
marvelous
feel
to
it
insane
drinkability
as
well
which
could
be
a
bad
thing
since
it
led
me
to
drink
it
quicker
than
expected
a
must
try
if
you
like
dubbels
pours
dark
brown
with
an
exeptional
head
filled
with
hills
and
valleys
the
aroma
is
the
most
remarkable
ive
experienced
very
earthy
brown
sugar
and
cinammon
the
flavor
starts
out
a
little
boozy
but
mellows
once
it
aerates
cinammon
apple
pepper
brown
sugar
butter
and
oolong
tea
with
musty
hints
the
bouquet
seems
to
fluctuate
between
a
almost
cleansing
edge
the
booze
numbs
the
tongue
but
oddly
this
one
is
far
from
a
palate
killer
im
deducting
the
drinkability
5
just
because
i
dont
think
this
one
is
perfect
but
it
is
damn
near
it
drinkability
this
blue
cap
is
similar
to
the
yellow
cap
however
it
is
more
balanced
and
less
sweet
this
pours
out
a
cloudy
dark
mahogany
the
head
is
stiff
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
at
first
upon
further
smelling
numerous
fruits
show
up
in
the
malt
profile
with
yeasty
esters
providing
a
very
complex
aroma
grape
juice
and
a
whif
of
alcohol
round
out
the
aroma
the
taste
is
right
up
there
with
the
aroma
it
is
smooth
complex
i
seem
to
find
something
different
in
every
sip
with
vinous
fruits
dominating
this
is
one
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
is
chewy
at
first
but
finishes
dry
leaving
a
nice
fruity
aftertaste
drinkability
is
insanely
good
for
a
beer
this
potent
first
sip
is
suprisingly
banal
maybe
the
hype
had
skewed
my
expectations
a
bready
malty
taste
with
a
hint
of
alchohol
and
good
hop
balance
i
served
the
beer
too
cold
but
as
i
warmed
the
goblet
with
my
hands
the
flavor
profiles
did
come
out
more
again
a
wonderful
malty
blance
with
hint
of
raisins
and
alchohol
i
found
the
balance
to
be
wonderful
and
suprisingly
the
aftertaste
to
also
be
exceptional
the
actual
taste
seemed
a
tad
flat
please
understand
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
i
honestly
have
enjoyed
others
more
the
st
bernardus
pater
6
that
ive
had
i
think
is
superior
i
also
enjoyed
the
chimay
i
had
during
the
postgame
chat
morechimay
blue
still
this
is
definitely
damm
good
i
will
try
this
beer
again
but
i
will
wait
till
i
visit
the
monks
in
person
god
willing
down
the
long
beer
drinking
road
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
and
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
to
be
honest
i
dont
get
the
hype
this
is
good
but
a
few
others
are
equally
good
or
better
in
my
humble
opinion
perhaps
the
most
ringing
endorsement
my
nonba
buddy
was
with
me
and
said
i
dont
really
like
belgian
beers
then
took
a
sip
and
said
i
enjoy
that
tastes
of
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
and
smokiness
the
middle
is
dominated
by
caramel
dark
berries

a
great
and
underrated
beer
from
flying
fish
i
have
had
this
on
multiple
occasions
and
i
think
its
one
of
the
most
drinkable
doubles
ive
had
maybe
because
the
abv
isnt
so
extreme
just
great
complex
flavor
body
and
feel
actually
not
bad
for
an
american
rendition
of
a
dubbel
great
belgium
style
dubbed
less
carbonated
than
imaging
and
equal
if
not
better
in
taste
easy
to
drink
smooth
finish
the
taste
is
very
good
with
malt
up
front
and
yeast
cohesion
in
the
light
spice
and
hint
of
dark
fruit
in
the
taste
the
light
toasted
grain
and
subtle
dried
plum
character
enhanced
by
subtle
caramel
and
mild
peppery
quality
lead
to
a
gentle
alcohol
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
with
very
drinkable
dry
quality
thanks
to
jc
for
sharing
first
real
go
at
a
dubbel
the
yeastiness
is
certainly
different
for
me
but
this
was
good
enough
for
me
to
try
others

this
is
a
very

winter
beer
for
the
price

for
a
six
pack
i
think
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
a
more
enjoyable
dubbel
for
the
7

abv
this
is
very
smooth
just
started
dabbling

it

has
been
the
best
i
have
tasted
ive
tried
a
lot
of
the
darker
microbrews
but
nothing
can
touch
the
abbey
overall
its
not
bad
to
drink
but
far
from
what
it
should
be
i
dont
enjoy
the
strength
of
the
roastiness
or
the
power
of
the
phenols
a
bit
bitter
ending
as
well
not
quite
what
i
would
look
for
as
an
abbey
dubbel
or
even
a
more
liberal
interpretation
of
the
style
but
overall
id
say
its
still
decent
and
drinkable
yummy
this
is
worth
a
shot
and
is
interesting
and
not
too
complex
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
sure
i
would
have
it
at
a
bar
it
is
worth
a
try
but
nothing
more
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
dubbel
overall
rather
easy
drinking
and
affordable
in
comparison
to
more
renowned
dubbels
it
is

still
a

when
having

payday

o

definitely
didnt
make
a
bad
brew
here
but
its
just
slightly
underwhelming
the
roasted

is
a
bit
too
pronounced
which
makes
for
a
very
burntsmoky
experience
this
might
be
good
at
the

or
paired
with
some
food
but
it
didnt
exactly
impress
me
as

on

a

this

drink

i
love
the
grainy

i
get
somewhat
nutty

completely
smooth
and
balanced
the
alcohol
is
way
too
sharp
when
chilled
in
to
the
high

low
40s
so
the
low
reviews
are
reasonable
if
serving
at

overall
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
because
of
the
high

1215

a

its
really
not

decent
dubbel
not
epic
by
any
means
but
pleasant
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
on
a
cold
night
o
not
much
of
a
proper
dubbel
but
not
bad
id
recommend
this
to
a
beginner
drinker
the
yeast
profile
is
both
subdued
and
very
basic
that
and
its
easy
to
drink
its
lowish
score
stems
from
the
fact
that
its
vapid
and
unfulfilling
to
someone
who
enjoys
this
style
done
well
there
was
enough
alcohol
here
to
be
sure
but
not
enough
to
make
me
think
that
this
was
purely
a
dubbel
it
just
didnt
feel
like
a
trappist
ale
and
almost
felt
like
an
imperial
brown
ale
because
of
the
stickiness
and
plain
nature
that
this
had
this
just
didnt
quite
measure
up
but
dubbels
are
full
complex
beasts
while
this
was
more
of
an
introductory
beer
to
that
style
if
youve
never
had
one
of
these
before
this
would
be
good
to
start
with
since
more
than
one
could
be
enjoyed
in
a
sitting
without
be
overwhelmed
had
this
warmed
me
up
a
bit
i
knew
that
it
would
have
been
more
on
target
in
the
taste
malty
sweet
with
some
light
dark
fruits
and
earthy
hops
nutty
and
hoppy
definitely
has
a
raisin
plum
pecan
thing
going
on
firmly
malty
but
nicely
balanced
caramel
raisin
toast
almond
pretty
complex
dubbel
medium
bodied
feel
with
a
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
overall
a
classic
american
version
of
a
dubbel
and
frankly
better
than
most
so
i
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
color
was
great
but
i
could
tell
from
the
pour
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
thin
dubble
i
know
theres
no
solid
numbers
for
abv
for
the
belgian
styles
but
7
2
seems
respectable
the
beer
looked
like
a
coke
in
terms
of
color
and
viscosity
the
nose
was
ok
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
other
than
the
yeast
but
the
taste
was
pretty
decent
dark
fruit
figs
raisins
it
was
very
carbonated
but
thin
would
i
have
this
again
probably
not
o
this
beer
tastes
a
little
lighter
compared
to
other
dubbels
and
doesnt
seem
to
have
enough
flavors
of
dark
fruits
pours
dark
reddish
brown
with
fast
settling
foam
raisin
plum
nose
sugary
malty
sweet
cola
taste
rich

black

flavor
firm
carbonation
a
touch
sweet
but
good
flavor
pretty
good
all
around
overall
an
easy
drinking
dubbel
thats
a
bit
too
light
for
the
style
but
right
now
im
drinking
it
on
a
hot
summer
night
and
its
simple
and
refreshing
enough
to
be
a
lawnmower
dubbel
o
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
definitely
not
at
the
same
level
of
real
belgians
but
a
solid
dubbel
from
jersey
this
would
be
good
for
the
beginning
dubbel
drinker
a
smaller
price
tag
to
sample
the
style
its
a
fine
ale
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
profile
o
not
up
with
the
finer
belgian
dubbels
but
certainly
respectable
and
far
less
expensive
in
the
us
pours
with
very
little
foam
but
nice
dark
brownamber
color
smells
like
bitter
fruit
mouthfeel
pretty
good
with
weak
coating
but
nice
carbonation
overall
with
7
2
alcohol
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
nothing
spectacular
about
it
average
but
good
definitely
flat
easy
to
drink
for
a
7
2
but
like
most
of
theri
beers
ive
tried
there
is
a
fishy
taste
to
it
i
just
cant
get
into
much
of
the
stuff
from
this
brewer
but
its
not
bad
maybe
its
just
psychological
pours
a
golden
orange
color
light
haze
soapy
head
scent
is
quite
yeasty
and
peppery
lacing
many
other
qualities
of
the
style
taste
follows
suit
mostly
yeast
and
spice
lacking
firm
malt
presence
and
fruitiness
moderate
carbonation
weak
sauce
nothing
too
bad
but
nothing
really
good
either
dark
fruits
pervade
fig
plum
toffee
bits
of
ginger
rounded
out
with
a
touch
of
spicy
yeast
this
isnt
overly
belgian
by
any
means
definitely
an
american
stab
at
it
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
a
good
representation
and
a
tasty
cap
to
my
evening
i
think
this
would
make
a
good
one
to
draw
someone
into
these
abbeystyles
nice
work
ff
o
i
think
this
was
a
good
offering
from
the
brewery
and
a
decent
shot
at
the

definitely
an
introduction
to
the

sorta
thing
to

tasty
and
satisfying
with

id
have
it

it

overall
just
kind

of
the

delicate

nicely

quite

than
either

i
cannot

that
alcohol
at

some

sugars
come
through
in

its
way
too
normal
and
smooth

tingly
creamy
mouthfeel
it
finishes
with
a
gently
lingering
sweet
maltiness
its
been
argued
that
this
beer
is
too
light
for
the
style
but
thats
not
true
it
ranks
admirably
side
by
side
with
many
belgians
a
very
nicely
done
and
quite
enjoyable
beer
extremely
malty
with
a
kick
in
the
pants
taste
of
alcohol
this
was
damn
near
undrinkable
i
had
liked
previous
belgianstyle
brews
but
this
one
was
just
to
malty
for
me
dark
auburn
color
with
a
rich
grey
head
very
carbonated
slightly
sweet
malt
nose
and
some
candi
sugar
sweet
taste
with
some
yeast
complexity
finish
has
hints
of
alcohol
dryness
it
also
has
some
smooth
mouth
and
good
body
to
the
brew
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
its
well
made
and
all
but
somthing
was
lacking
in
the
nosetaste
dept
i
do
like
the
style
i
think
when
it
comes
to
dubbels
belgium
has
it
locked
up
notes
not
a
bad
try
a
tad
too
much
roasted
malt
flavour
with
a
close
to
over
kill
phenolic
character
that
seems
too
clean
say
it
again
not
bad
but
not
close
to
a
real
belgian
dubbel
whether
abbey
or
trappist
or
just
from
belgium
from
the
first
pour
of
the
deep
brown
liquid
that
forms
a
longlasting
tan
head
to
the
last
swallow
this
beer
comes
as
close
to
perfection
as
any
american
beer
i
have
tried
opening
the
cap
reveals
a
fruity
aroma
which
is
followed
by
a
wonderous
first
sip
both
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
caramel
dates
and
biscuit
flavors
come
forward
the
brew
finishes
long
and
clean
though
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
biggest
drawback
is
that
it
does
not
go
well
with
snack
foods
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
molasses
malts
mild
spice
taste
is
fruits
yeast
malts
a
touch
of
spice
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
light
syrupy
with
slight
bitterness
burnt
amber
laced
fine
off
white
foam
boozy
heat
and
candi
sugar
peanut
shell
burly
malt
heavy
sweetness
upfront
gives
way
to
oat
well
balanced
nutty
flavor
great
finish
this
was
a
great
ale
smooth
rich
with
a
very
light
effervescence
just
the
slightest
bit
of
drying
but
a
whole
lot
of
warming
the
flavor
and
body
are
a
perfect
primer
for
the
thanksgiving
feast
in
two
weeks
wish
i
had
another
to
complement
that
meal
the
best
beer
from
abita
ive
ever
had
by
a
good
stretch
not
good
tasted
exactly
like
fresh
sweet
feed
that
i
put
out
for
deer
o
this
is
best
nonbelgian
belgian
style
ale
i
can
recall
most
of
the
imitation
belgian
fail
to
capture
all
the
elements
but
this
one
checks
all
the
boxes
4
25
ha
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
pint
superior
ingredients
to
other
abbey
ales
fruity
in
flavor
along
with
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
calming
in
its
effect
definitely
not
overwhelming
a
beautiful
brownish
red
in
color
the
marksmanship
of
a
true
abbey
delicious
at
its
tip
and
smooth
all
the
way
down
in
its
consumption
the
creaminess
of
the
body
gives
it
a
medium
full
feel
the
fine
carbonation
works
very
well
with
the
rich
malts
which
are
balanced
by
the
yeast
and
alcohol
flavors
o
delicious
dubbel
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
very
surprised
in
a
good
way
o
wonderful
beer
very
different
great
flavor
nicely
done
have
to
give
it
a
bit
of
credit
given
the
price
compared
to
other
brews
that
claim
to
be
abbey
type
ales
i
guess
a
nice
try
but
i
wouldnt
introduce
a
newcomer
to
the
style
with
this
brew
the
taste
brings
out
a
little
more
of
the
toasted
malts
but
it
is
the
almost
juicelike
red
grape
that
overpowers
everything
else
in
the
character
some
tart
bitterness
on
the
tail
end
not
on
my
buy
again
list
only
good
thing
i
can
say
is
that
the
proceeds
of
this
brew
are
donated
to
a
hospital
and
thats
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
ah
okay
so
lets
sit
down
to
some
abbey
ale
by
the
abita
brewing
company
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
brew
as
im
a
huge
fan
anything
that
says
ale
and
i
mean
from
all
ends
of
the
spectrum
from
indian
pale
ales
to
smoked
darker
ales
i
love
ale
so
without
furtherado
lets
crack
this
baby
open
on
pouring
the
brew
it
had
a
deep
reddish
orange
appearance
and
a
thick
foamy
creamy
brown
head
lasting
even
into
my
first
sip
i
drank
this
brew
at
room
temperature
to
give
everyone
my
full
experience
info
and
honestly
im
glad
i
kept
it
that
way
the
taste
had
apples
yeast
ginger
cinnamon
and
i
want
to
say
vanilla
its
a
very
interesting
brew
and
its
actually
growing
on
me
the
more
sips
i
take
i
feel
that
this
brew
was
very
pleasant
and
at
the
price
a
good
deal
its
not
among
the
world
class
beers
by
all
means
but
i
would
say
more
of
a
nice
autumn
time
brew
it
has
a
nice
fizz
in
the
mouth
that
lingers
after
letting
it
down
the
hatch
overall
if
youre
considering
this
brew
my
fellow
new
advocates
go
ahead
and
grab
a
bottle
youll
be
glad
you
did
thanks
for
reading
my
review
and
as
always
beer
on
my
friends
o
pretty
solid
beer
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
this
will
not
stop
me
from
drinking
it
again
not
a
true
abbey
ale
in
my
opinion
but
still
an
alright
beer
in
general
overall
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
dubbels
but
i
liked
this
one
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
abita
o
not
a
big
fan
of
abita
but
this
is
an
excellent
and
very
accessible
representation
of
a
belgian
dubbel
this
was
intense
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
smell
and
then
further
surprised
by
the
shock
of
yeasty
flavour
when
i
took
my
first
sip
this
is
an
interesting
foray
into
belgianstyle
beer
and
one
of
the
harshest
on
the
yeast
front
ive
ever
had
especially
for
a
dubbel
that
was
enjoyable
to
an
extent
but
definitely
a
bit
much
it
was
a
tad
sour
from
all
the
yeast
but
the
malts
tasted
delicious
and
the
alcohol
kick
was
very
discernible
on
the
finish
which
i
enjoyed
so
all
in
all
it
was
interesting
and
enjoyable
but
not
really
a
topnotch
dubbel
o
not
disgusting
but
i
am
disappointed
and
wont
seek
this
out
again
o
interesting
take
on
a
dubbel
from
our
cajun
friends
has
a
very
noursing
quality
almost
like
the
liquid
bread
mentioned
on
the
bottle
good
complexity
of
flavors
present
worth
trying
if
you
are
an
abita
fan
or
are
interested
in
domestic
dubbels
this
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
mild
malty
scent
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
toasty
mixed
with
hints
of
fruits
it
finishes
clean
and
refreshing
quite
a
well
made
abbey
ale
from
the
deep
south
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
can
find
it
in
your
area
pours
a
honey
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
spices
and
a
slight
fruit
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
toasted
malt
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
all
that
exciting
for
an
american
take
on
the
style
overall
i
found
this
to
be
quite
a
nice
beer
and
i
am
usually
hit
or
miss
on
abita
brews
for
4
99
this
is
a
pretty
good
bargain
and
a
very
enjoyable
beer
very
drinkable
in
a
holiday
christmas
environment
o
good
looking
beer
smell
seemed
a
little
disappointing
i
expected
a
little
more
dark
fruit
maybe
some
esters
huge
flavor
but
lacking
a
solid
red
fruit
quality
excellent
feel
from
sweet
to
dry
and
with
an
enjoyable
amount
of
alcohol
for
5
bucks
for
a
22oz
bottle
i
have
no
complaints
about
this
beer
have
i
had
better
abbey
beers
why
of
course
this
one
is
special
in
its
own
way
though
i
love
new
belgium
abbey
and
this
one
doesnt
compare
in
the
same
reasons
i
like
it
it
has
its
own
special
space
in
my
life
though
do
not
purchase
it
and
think
that
you
are
getting
a
high
end
superior
beer
but
if
you
want
to
bring
your
friends
along
who
think
bud
light
and
miller
lite
are
the
only
beer
made
this
might
be
the
one
to
introduce
them
to
in
my
opinion
i
could
drink
this
while
grilling
burgers
and
brats
and
just
enjoy
the
crap
out
of
life
o
abita
abbey
ale
is
enjoyable
if
not
challenging
i
think
abita
did
justice
to
the
dubbel
style
and
its
cool
that
they
donate
profits
to
a
local
abbey
in
sum
i
think
some
extra
work
with
the
recipe
could
tweak
this
into
an
amazing
beer
very
nice
blend
and
sounds
like
a
worthy
cause
to
boot
o
im
really
quite
impressed
abita
got
it
right
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
the
brewery
will
definitely
drink
again
o
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
abita
but
some
tweaking
is
required
to
bring
this
ale
up
to
snuff
the
nose
is
very
onedimensional
and
the
body
feels
a
bit
thinner
than
it
should
while
this
ale
may
taste
like
a
dubbel
it
doesnt
particularly
smell
or
feel
like
one
a
worthy
effort
that
has
produced
mediocre
results
overall
other
than
the
mouthfeel
the
beer
really
has
very
nice
characteristics
it
has
a
nice
sweeter
fruit
profile
mixed
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
a
fairly
good
sweeter
dubbel
crisp
and
prickly
up
front
with
toasted
notes
yeasty
sweetness
spicy
hops
clove
leaf
texture
very
smooth
hops
bitterness
washes
away
nicely
with
a
friendly
yeast
flavor
that
lingers
hangs
around
like
a
tasty
wine
only
better
grows
creamy
as
it
warms
depth
character
shines
through
this
one
o
pretty
offbalance
in
general
but
its
drinkable
and
there
should
be
something
to
be
said
for
that
right
poured
into
a
brandy
snifter
pours
deep
copper
with
an
offwhite
two
finger
head
the
smell
is
of
sugar
fig
and
malt
i
pick
up
malty
sweetness
in
the
taste
as
well
as
cinnamon
and
fig
it
has
a
dry
finish
and
this
is
not
much
bitterness
but
the
hops
are
definitely
present
the
bread
flavor
also
comes
out
in
this
beer
the
taste
is
complex
and
wellbalanced
the
alcohol
doesnt
come
forward
in
the
flavor
at
all
plenty
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
body
is
on
the
higher
end
of
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
moderate
making
this
a
very
drinkable
dubbel
i
have
to
tip
my
hat
to
abita
for
creating
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
dubbel
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
id
say
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
though
cheers
o
its
alright
nothing
to
write
home
about
out
of
a
bomber
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
khaki
colored
head
the
aroma
was
a
very
inviting
bouquet
of
vanilla
belgian
yeast
caramel
malt
nuts
and
hints
of
bread
the
flavors
were
similar
with
clear
notes
of
yeast
bread
and
caramel
sweetness
along
with
more
subdued
flavors
of
figs
pepper
plum
nuts
and
some
spicy
hops
on
the
finish
complex
but
drinkable
and
punchy
without
tasting
boozy
balanced
in
short
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
mediumlight
it
was
notably
sweet
for
the
style
but
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
so
this
appeal
to
me
enjoyable
and
worth
your
money
sampled
from
a
pint
glass
o
so
i
actually
liked
this
beer
i
might
not
recommend
it
but
i
certainly
dont
mind
finishing
the
whole
22
ounce
bottle
good
effort
average
result
overall
i
wish
this
beer
tasted
as
good
as
it
smells
but
its
pretty
good
for
a
5
dollar
bomber
not
bad
spent
5
for
this
badboy
at
bevmo
honestly
one
of
the
best
american
belgian
styles
i
have
tried
overall
as
a
student
of
st
josephs
seminary
this
beer
is
a
source
of
income
for
all
us
all
25
cents
of
every
bottle
goes
to
monks
here
at
the
abbey
in
st
benedict
la
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
benedictine
monks
of
the
catholic
church
have
learned
to
perfect
worldwide
it
is
meets
all
expectations
of
the
art
of
brewing
beer
at
monasteries
again
it
may
not
be
as
great
as
some
of
the
trappist
monastery
ales
of
europe
but
it
comes
close
at
a
better
price
vivat
christus
rex
overall
its
just
an
ok
dubble
my
first
beer
from
bayou
country
and
well
theyve
done
justice
to
the
belgian
tradition
is
all
i
can
say
the
sweetness
could
sure
use
some
further
counterbalance
but
for
the
time
being
i
sure
aint
fixin
to
complain
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
with
a
little
bit
of
excitement
and
curiosity
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
light
brownish
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
some
light
floral
aromas
belgian
yeast
and
some
grains
in
there
too
the
taste
is
soft
and
tasted
pretty
close
to
a
traditional
abbey
ale
the
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
smooth
overall
it
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
wouldnt
need
to
have
it
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
very
enjoyable
seems
to
be
straddling
the
dubbeltripel
line
as
there
is
a
midpalate
lift
and
esteryness
that
says
tripel
really
good
effort
and
one
i
will
return
to
alrighty
the
app
is
as
follows
a
deep
reddish
brown
clear
chestnut
color
with
a
ton
of
visible
carbonation
and
a
2
finger
head
that
lays
to
a
tightly
bubbled
ring
around
the
top
big
sugary
malt
on
the
nose
with
a
sour
fruit
scent
that
gives
it
a
salty
olive
kinda
smell
sugary
raisins
found
all
over
this
beer
the
taste
is
all
over
the
place
from
sweet
malt
to
biscuity
malts
to
wild
cherries
to
dark
fruits
back
to
sweet
malts
finishes
very
well
but
everything
in
the
middle
combines
to
a
big
sour
climax
then
back
to
a
sweet
finish
medium
on
the
feel
velvety
sour
high
carbonation
yet
smooth
overall
this
is
ok
i
couldnt
shake
the
olive
taste
though
nice
for
the
price
as
it
was
only
3
bucks
how
can
you
beat
that
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonated
bite
for
the
style
really
drinkable
and
satisfying
drinkability
very
good
as
a
fan
of
belgian
dubbels
and
bspas
i
like
this
one
a
lot
could
easily
session
with
it
and
the
big
bottle
was
gone
quick
i
would
buy
this
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
the
price
was
good
under
8
pretty
average
belgian
dubbel
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
abita
beers
but
i
like
this
one
and
i
enjoy
this
one
often
worthy
of
a
try
tmo
carmel
covered
dates
raisens
drenched
in
a
fine
dark
rum
with
a
blanket
of
warming
booziness
more
of
the
same
from
the
smell
is
in
the
flavor
alcohol
is
blended
well
very
deceiving
at
8
mouthful
is
a
bit
chewy
and
drinkablity
is
on
the
low
end
for
me
such
a
sweet
style
to
begin
with
one
bomber
is
good
enough
for
me
good
beer
not
great
but
worth
trying
very
nice
beer
would
be
ideal
with
cigars
overall
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
alcohol
well
hidden
and
very
tasty
nicely
balanced
o
overall
a
very
nicely
made
dubbel
at
8abv
not
too
boozy
tasty
pleasant
drink
this
is
a
rather
excellent
american
brwed
belgian
style
i
really
appreciate
this
one
because
this
was
the
very
first
style
of
beer
i
ever
brwed
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
its
worth
checking
out
if
you
are
attracted
to
the
bottle
art
and
description
this
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
i
was
not
a
fan
at
all
after
the
first
sip
as
it
warmed
up
so
did
i
a
little
at
8
abv
it
hides
the
alcohol
taste
very
well
not
bad
as
a
post
dinnerdesert
sipper
like
i
said
a
bit
harsh
right
out
of
the
fridge
though
y
extremely
sweet
smell
as
expected
of
a
sweet
smelling
beer
it
starts
off
malty
then
the
hops
kick
in
and
the
bitterness
offsets
the
malt
in
a
strong
way
its
not
very
distinct
in
any
special
way
overall
id
give
it
a
b
drinkability
as
this
beer
warms
the
alcohol
vanishes
and
it
becomes
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
a
bit
sweet
and
rich
so
i
might
not
make
a
night
of
it
its
still
very
good
and
worth
a
try
if
available
the
ease
of
drinkability
and
high
abv
make
for
a
dangerous
combination
at
first
but
as
i
go
along
i
started
to
sip
d
refreshing
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
its
a
dangerous
drinker
one
bomber
left
me
pretty
much
buzzed
this
ale
is
a
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
colors
with
a
stick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
sweet
raisins
prunes
with
a
noticeable
spicy
clove
character
from
the
yeast
the
flavor
closely
follows
the
nose
moderate
bittersweet
malts
with
peppery
spicy
yeast
character
the
body
is
mediumfull
silky
mouthfeel
and
nice
lingering
maltyyeasty
flavors
overall
a
tasty
wellmade
brew
worth
picking
up
a
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
medium
1
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
extremely
sweet
with
hints
of
apricot
and
plum
the
taste
has
a
nice
malty
caramel
flavor
along
with
some
sugary
sweetness
the
finish
brings
some
of
the
dried
fruit
taste
this
was
a
medium
body
brew
and
had
a
nice
malt
presence
one
of
the
better
abita
i
had
when
in
nola
glad
i
brought
back
to
share
d
another
tasty
offering
from
a
brewery
that
hasnt
let
me
down
so
far
its
not
the
top
example
of
the
style
but
certainly
worth
a
try
this
is
an
easily
consumed
brew
its
a
nice
drinker
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
others
d
solid
dubble
nothing
outstanding
but
a
good
brew
nonetheless
d
very
drinkable
all
in
all
very
good
balance
in
all
aspects
disguises
the
abv
well
too
d
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
very
drinkable
i
wonder
how
something
like
this
would
age
well
worth
the
price
i
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
md
hits
all
the
dubbel
notes
well
the
sweetness
lingers
for
a
long
time
but
never
gets
too
syrupy
or
cloying
best
abita
beer
ive
had
so
far
bottle
was
large
1
pint
6
ounces
i
recommend
drinking
with
a
friend
or
two
its
kind
of
much
alone
if
this
is
not
your
favorite
style
worthy
beer
d
would
recommend
giving
a
try
better
than
most
of
the
other
abita
offerings
i
appreciate
and
like
that
abita
is
trying
a
new
and
interesting
style
not
as
boozy
as
some
other
belgian
beers
in
the
same
arena
besides
the
price
is
right
at
4
99
imho
d
above
average
in
my
book
but
scores
a
exta
12
point
on
the
drinkability
scale
due
to
the
25
donation
abita
makes
with
every
bottle
sold
crisp
but
lush
with
a
fine
bubble
structure
almost
fluffy
on
the
palate
with
some
dry
warmth
lingering
booze
and
a
slight
acidic
twang
very
enjoyable
with
a
moderate
level
of
complexity
certainly
an
above
average
dubbel
d
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
go
at
a
dubbel
very
affordable
but
the
8
is
a
bit
of
a
holdback
d
drinkability
is
good
for
a
dubbel
im
not
going
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
this
trumps
a
st
bernardus
chimay
or
ommegang
but
it
can
hold
its
own
and
sufficiently
puts
the
belgians
on
notice
the
folks
at
abita
have
done
an
excellent
job
taking
the
dubbel
style
and
infusing
it
with
just
enough
american
craft
styles
to
stand
out
but
remain
an
homage
to
the
originals
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
at
again
but
probably
wouldnt
become
one
of
my
regulars
dwould
have
again
but
not
my
first
choice
for
an
abbey
style
was
ready
to
try
something
else
after
i
finished
the
tall
bottle
excellent
winter
bear
drinkability
one
and
im
done
not
bad
but
not
good
if
you
know
what
i
mean
as
always
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
d
despite
a
smell
i
dont
really
get
abita
presents
an
abbeydubbel
thats
plenty
drinkable
heck
i
wouldnt
be
a
repeat
buyer
if
there
wasnt
something
here
i
enjoy
not
an
equal
substitute
for
the
european
masterpieces
but
a
darn
good
buy
at
around
4bottle
remember
two
bits
goes
to
the
brothers
amen
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
the
yeast
also
gives
off
quite
a
bit
of
fruity
esters
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
dry
caramelroasted
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
a
good
deal
of
yeast
fruitiness
its
not
as
complex
as
i
would
like
and
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
the
best
dubbel
around
still
its
good
to
see
these
guys
branching
out
into
different
styles
could
drink
several
bombers
a
great
find
it
is
darker
and
maltier
but
not
heavy
i
can
see
why
the
website
recommends
it
with
dessert
foods
it
certainly
was
nice
after
dinner
drinkability
is

d
after
the
first
couple
sips
i
thought
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
it
seemed
atypical
for
the
style
but
that
doesnt
bother
me
but
the
further
down
the
glass
i
got
this
one
really
seemed
to
drag
this
was
largely
do
to
the
issues
in
mouthfeel
similar
to
abitas
andygator
this
beer
has
to
potential
but
there
are
significant
kinks
that
need
to
be
hammered
out
for
it
to
be
an
adequate
representation
of
a
dubbel
too
much
nutmeg
to
want
to
go
back
to
this
again

a

lasts
and
some

a
clear
medium

aroma
is
caramel
malt
earth
yeast
and
a
bit
of
funk
flavor
is
like

plus
some
definite
sweet
fruitiness
and
just
a
tad
of
bitterness
in
the
background
and
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
body
is
decent
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is

flavor
and
of

length
perhaps
a

sweet

my
sessions
the
abita

ale

deep
copper
almost
brown

with
a
nice
fizzy
off
white

smell
is
sweet
with
raisins

cloves
with

taste
is
very
nice
raisins
yeast
and

up
most
of
the
quaff
minimal
hop

noted
on
the
palate

i
would
like
to
see
how
this
one
develops
in
the
bottle
good
work
from
a
new
brewery
to
me
jd
pours
a
clear
brownamber
color
one
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
yeast
sweet
malt
clove
hint
of
citrus
banana
hint
of
alcohol
hint
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
wheat
fits
the
style
of
an
abbey
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
sweet
malt
clove
hint
of
wheat
hint
of
dark
citrus
and
a
hint
of
hops
only
complaint
is
that
the
feel
and
body
were
a
little
weak
it
poured
a
dark
auburn
and
a
bit
cloudy
i
was
surprised
by
how
dark
it
was
however
it
had
a
nice
thick
caramel
colored
head
that
left
rings
as
i
drank
it
the
nose
was
peanuts
and
cloves
it
has
a
malty
rich
mouthfeel
and
a
hint
of
apricot
im
not
a
big
fan
of
cloves
but
i
can
appreciate
the
big
part
it
plays
in
this
beer
the
finish
is
long
but
not
overwhelming
this
beer
has
a
nice
belgian
style
but
was
definitely
americanised
by
abita
they
did
a
great
job
and
i
can
see
having
this
beer
with
some
pork
chops
and
applesauce
given
the
foam
explosion
and
the
unfortunate
aftermath
its
obvious
that
this
bomber
of
abita
abbey
ale
isnt
as
the
brewers
intended
however
i
dont
believe
the
bottle
is
infected
maybe
youll
have
better
luck
but
its
probably
best
to
stick
with
the
belgian
brasseries
for
your
wellbrewed
dubbel
needs
d
i
could
drink
this
dubbel
for
a
long
time
if
it
was
not
8
abv
fantastic
a
rather
impressive
offering
from
the
brewery
i
first
became
acquainted
with
while
doing
recover
work
post
katrina
abita
did
a
very
nice
job
of
pegging
the
dubbel
style
with
a
very
authentic
yeasty
funk
going
on
overlying
some
moderately
sweet
caramel
and
prune
notes
a
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
and
the
8
abv
was
well
blended
into
the
flavor
profile
lending
a
touch
of
pepper
drinkability
is
pretty
good
enjoyable
not
the
best
dubbel
but
damn
nice
try
for
an
american
brewer
thats
not
know
for
great
brews
anyway
cheap
easy
drinking
nothing
really
over
distracting
certainly
worth
a
try
maybe
more
then
one
should
probably
try
again
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
done
quiet
well
and
worth
trying
lots
of
flavor
easy
to
drink
medium
bodied
long
finish
wonderful
dubbel
from
louisiana
who
would
have
thunk
it
pours
a
somewhat
murky
brown
with
a
fairly
decent
creamy
head
that
sticks
around
but
leaves
no
real
lacing
smells
very
sweet
with
lots
of
residual
sugars
and
a
bit
of
clove
tastes
softer
and
more
subtle
than
expected
after
the
nose
but
with
a
slightly
metallic
finish
soft
lightly
spicy
and
relatively
creamy
in
the
mouth
but
a
little
jagged
right
in
the
mouth
decent
and
drinkable
if
not
superlative
pours
a
reddish
brown
hazy
with
moderately
sized
offwhite
head
nose
has
some
bready
notes
whiff
of
bubblegum
not
in
a
bad
way
and
candy
on
the
palate
theres
plenty
of
the
candiedgummy
flavors
coming
through
with
some
bready
flavors
and
a
sweettangy
finish
not
bad
on
drinkability
did
not
enjoy
this
one
that
much
the
flavor
isnt
there
this
is
a
lot
like
chimay
blue
and
its
very
mild
to
mild
in
my
opinion
i
prefer
the
supposedly
inferior
chimay
red
much
more
flavor
overall
i
think
it
is
an
impressive
beer
especially
since
it
is
coming
from
abita
who
is
known
for
very
sessionable
beers
i
like
seeing
breweries
trying
things
off
their
normal
path
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
you
might
just
need
a
buddy
to
finish
it
with
you
a
good
solid
offering
from
abita
drinkability
is
okay
the
sweetspicey
aspect
begins
to
take
its
toll
about
halfway
through
making
the
bottle
a
bit
hard
to
finish
220z
bomber
pours
an
amber
color
topped
with
a
frothy
3
finger
head
with
good
retention
the
aroma
is
extreme
malt
accented
by
a
variety
of
sweet
fruits
it
sits
solidly
on
the
tongue
well
balanced
not
too
sticky
on
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overbearing
a
sold
effort
by
abita
the
taste
is
sweet
fruity
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
and
an
earthy
yeast
flavor
nice
smooth
and
thick
body
and
great
drinkability
d
its
good
but
not
great
you
can
handle
a
bomber
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
chewy
sweet
and
dry
taste
follows
suit
closely
as
the
belgian
yeast
presence
is
very
strong
contributing
doughy
bread
and
ripe
fruits
galore
some
tartness
is
in
there
as
well
as
plenty
of
candi
sugar
sweetness
to
give
it
some
depth
maybe
even
some
dark
brown
sugar
comes
to
the
party
it
seems
a
year
in
the
cellar
has
done
this
beer
well
surprisingly
there
is
still
a
noticeable
leafy
hop
and
toast
bitterness
on
the
finish
not
necessarily
complex
but
has
plenty
to
offer
flavorwise
abv
is
not
exactly
well
hidden
but
neither
is
it
offensively
brash
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
another
bottle
or
two
to
see
what
happens
especially
at
4
bucks
a
bomber
not
bad
at
all
for
abitas
first
foray
into
the
world
of
belgian
beers
i
recommend
they
try
some
more
decent
brew
and
worth
it
for
the
price
mouthfeel
is
thin
lacking
body
great
to
see
something
so
unexpected
from
abita
but
could
use
more
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
imo
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
great
one
either
doesnt
seem
to
hit
the
style
exactly
but
very
drinkable
an
interesting
yeast
culture
going
on
here
with
significant
exposure
the
beer
opens
up
to
become
rather
pleasant
a
light
malt
presence
for
the
style
yet
typical
for
abita
accompanies
a
decent
feel
bottom
line
for
me
is
that
the
aroma
is
an
insurmountable
obstacle
for
this
brew
bon
chance
this
was
a
good
one
overall
drinkability
4
0
a
good
solid
belgianlike
beer
this
is
almost
more
like
a
lightly
hopped
american
brown
to
me
than
an
abbey
ale
because
there
is
no
yeast
character
very
enjoyable
beer
just
not
the
full
abbey
experience
i
was
hoping
for
d
its
drinkable
but
would
not
purchase
again
its
on
par
with
abitas
other
brews
d
the
first
drink
i
accidentally
swallowed
without
tasting
something
about
this
drives
you
to
swallow
without
savoring
but
it
also
leaves
some
sort
of
odd
aftertaste
although
it
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
with
a
final
pleasant
aroma
something
is
a
bit
off
here
its
not
enough
to
ruin
the
overall
experience
and
is
still
a
worthy
beer
to
try
out
d
overall
this
was
a
decent
dubbel
i
thought
the
taste
was
a
little
too
sweet
but
the
smell
was
pretty
good
for
the
cost
i
paid
3
99
it
was
well
worth
it
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
well
i
paid
3
99
for
this
bomber
and
thats
about
what
i
got
out
of
it
i
loved
the
andygator
and
was
hoping
for
more
of
the
same
out
of
this
but
i
was
disappointed
here
drinkabilityvery
very
drinkable
although
i
couldnt
drink
it
al
night
long
rjt
i
was
excited
to
find
this
bottle
in
se
ct
since
id
only
heard
of
abita
but
i
found
this
beer
a
little
lacklustre
compared
to
other
abbey
style
beers
it
was
too
sweet
and
i
was
turned
off
by
the
initial
bready
taste
im
definitely
excited
to
see
what
else
abita
has
to
offer
taste
is
vert
trappistlike
has
some
nice
sweetness
light
raisin
hints
and
sweet
maltiness
nice
light
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
its
present
but
not
over
the
top
d
i
dont
know
i
didnt
find
this
enjoyable
and
i
find
this
especially
strange
for
the
style
please
pass
on
this
one
drinkability
overall
is
quite
enjoyable
and
for
anybody
with
an
interest
in
abita
its
nice
to
see
the
transformation
from
where
i
started
drinking
their
brews
almost
ten
years
ago
to
the
post
katrina
professional
machine
that
abita
has
become
with
effective
distribution
and
adventurous
new
big
beer
lineup
coming
out
this
is
the
second
in
that
classification
im
sad
to
say
that
i
missed
the
helles
doppelbock
andygator
abita
hits
you
with
a
22oz
abbey
style
ale
this
was
a
nice
rendition
of
a
long
time
personal
favorite
my
all
time
favorite
being
orval
poured
a
cloudy
orangybeige
color
the
nose
was
swimming
with
different
flavors
yeast
and
bread
dough
come
to
mind
the
taste
is
layered
in
complexity
with
banana
cloves
yeast
and
spice
a
hardy
beer
overall
a
good
smelling
and
tasting
beer
with
a
nice
abv
strength
definately
will
return
to
this
brew
at
a
later
date
notes
from
jan
4th
2010
this
isnt
extremely
complex
but
its
definitely
good
and
at
something
like
4
for
a
bomber
which
is
about
the
lowest
ive
ever
seen
for
a
larger
craft
brew
bottle
its
a
great
alternative
to
some
of
the
pricier
dubbels
out
there
i
will
be
getting
this
again
d
nice
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
love
to
sip
on
more
than
this
once
first
sip
had
a
strong
bite
slight
tartness
but
overall
drinkable
mahogany
in
color
and
quite
clear
out
of
the
bomber
and
into
my
glass
about
a
finger
of
beige
head
smells
of
over
ripe
bananas
cloves
and
raisins
also
a
touch
of
pumpkin
very
sweet
once
it
hits
your
mouth
lots
of
spices
present
as
well
almost
reminds
me
of
carrot
cake
it
has
a
sense
of
breadiness
to
it
the
banana
that
is
so
present
in
the
nose
is
more
subtle
in
the
taste
there
is
also
a
slight
citric
bittering
towards
the
finish
lending
to
a
relatively
dry
finish
this
got
better
the
further
into
the
bomber
i
got
id
probably
have
this
again
if
i
happened
upon
it
overall
its
a
solid
beer
i
prefer
abitas
other
big
beer
andygator
over
this
overall
its
not
a
great
representation
of
style
and
abita
has
many
other
brews
that
are
more
than
acceptable
and
rather
good
the
price
point
for
this
doesnt
do
much
justification
either
mouthfeel
was
not
as
carbonated
as
one
would
expect
medium
bodied
im
always
appreciative
of
an
american
brewer
trying
to
make
a
belgian
style
beer
sometimes
they
even
manage
to
nail
it
this
is
not
one
of
those
times
while
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
it
still
needs
some
work
to
be
mentioned
among
the
better
beers
of
this
style
comments
a
delicious
malty
sweet
beer
that
at
5
is
an
excellent
value
im
still
new
to
beer
reviewing
but
this
is
one
of
the
most
spiced
beers
ive
tried
recently
and
the
banana
flavor
is
quite
interesting
almost
like
a
dunkelweisen
on
steroid
malts
though
at
times
it
becomes
almost
cloyingly
sweet
drinkability
i
really
love
the
way
abita
tackles
bigger
beers
this
is
nice
and
malty
i
like
the
flavor
combos
it
is
a
very
clean
bready
beer
that
i
will
have
again
d
needs
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
i
think
abv
is
apparent
but
later
in
drinking
this
smell
is
very
good
but
the
rest
fails
there
are
better
us
attempts
in
dubbles
out
there
one
is
enough
not
bad
to
get
a
22
oz
bottle
for
5
in
ny
but
overall
this
beer
was
just
ok
id
grab
a
real
belgian
before
i
grabbed
this
again
especially
considering
that
i
really
like
some
of
abitas
other
beers
turbodog
purple
haze
jockamo
ipa
strawberry
harvest
lager
etc
good
example
of
style
but
not
one
that
id
necessarily
go
back
to
again
the
mouth
is
light
but
also
somewhat
syrupy
at
beginning
with
a
drier
finish
this
is
a
nice
sipping
beer
but
about
average
imho
sorry
to
those
who
enjoyed
it
but
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
beer
i
wont
be
having
it
again
next
time
i
see
a
bottle
i
will
try
it
again
but
this
was
not
by
any
means
a
stale
bottle
i
got
it
directly
from
the
distributor
so
it
hadnt
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
somewhere
for
months
again
i
will
give
it
another
chance
and
i
hope
to
change
my
mind
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
chalice
glass
pours
reddish
brown
with
no
real
head
smells
of
canned
peaches
molases
and
lilies
tastes
sharp
and
citrusy
up
front
with
a
nice
mellow
caramel
warmth
in
the
back
very
nice
definitely
the
best
abita
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
nicely
carbonated
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
low
alcohol
warmth
and
a
balanced
feel
maybe
a
bit
sweet
for
some
but
a
fault
i
can
easily
forgive
for
charity
of
course
drinkability
an
interesting
take
on
the
dubbel
style
there
are
better
and
there
are
definitely
worse
for
3
99
i
cant
complain
a
big
burst
of
bubbles
results
in
a
nicesized
dark
tan
head
that
sticks
for
a
bit
before
dying
out
and
leaving
a
thin
lacing
with
some
spots
strewn
above
here
and
there
color
is
ruby
red
with
some
reddishorange
hues
where
the
light
hits
sweet
bread
and
dark
sour
fruits
rise
to
the
nose
a
damp
earthiness
works
itself
into
the
mix
after
a
slight
shake
of
the
glass
tastes
malty
and
grainy
with
some
lighter
fruits
in
the
background
some
hops
and
a
boozy
alcohol
heat
work
into
the
mix
later
on
overall
the
taste
is
a
little
weak
and
theres
something
a
little
off
in
the
balance
but
its
not
so
bad
as
to
ruin
the
experience
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
as
is
the
carbonation
not
as
bad
as
expected
but
needs
some
refinement
in
some
key
areas
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
tan
head
over
the
clear
reddish
copper
brew
head
recedes
everso
slowly
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
heavy
on
the
fruits
and
some
light
earthiness
taste
mirrors
the
nose
but
the
close
is
alcoholic
and
harsh
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
but
limited
by
the
harsh
close
with
drinkability
being
alright
these
new
abita
22s
have
not
been
a
deal
sure
the
price
tag
was
nice
3
99
but
its
not
even
worth
that
pours
a
wonderful
redbrown
in
the
glass
with
relatively
little
head
obvious
smell
of
fruit
but
not
as
much
so
as
a
lot
of
other
dubbels
a
very
pleasant
tasty
beer
drinks
a
little
lighter
than
a
lot
of
dubbels
with
the
sense
of
alcohol
and
yeast
a
little
less
obvious
as
a
result
the
beer
isnt
as
complex
as
the
best
examples
of
the
style
but
is
still
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
though
perhaps
slightly
too
sweet
a
very
enjoyable
beer
though
especially
for
the
price
m
d
considering
the
style
the
body
comes
across
on
being
a
little
lighter
id
still
consider
it
to
be
of
medium
body
but
a
bit
milder
than
many
out
there
it
doesnt
have
the
shimmering
richness
that
many
classic
belgians
do
which
is
unfortunate
as
its
a
wonderful
feeling
over
the
tongue
alcohol
is
pretty
much
completely
hidden
however
which
makes
the
abv
seem
far
more
tame
white
it
doesnt
really
becoming
sickly
and
cloying
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
though
pours
a
beautiful
sunrise
red
with
a
good
looking
tan
head
that
takes
its
time
settling
smells
fruity
and
yeasty
a
bit
of
bubblegum
and
dark
fruits
not
as
fragrant
as
most
dubbels
but
not
bad
tastes
sweet
a
bit
like
prunes
with
a
finish
that
leaves
a
funky
prune
taste
lingering
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
does
not
rank
with
many
other
easily
accessible
dubbels
d
tasty
balanced
and
enjoyable
not
exactly
transcendence
in
a
glass
but
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
definitely
a
food
beer
not
a
standalone
sipper
called
abbey
ale
but
described
as
a
dubbel
on
the
bottle
at
8
abv
im
inclined
to
go
with
the
latter
ill
make
it
a
point
to
share
a
bottle
with
a
fellow
beer
dork
who
only
thinks
of
abita
in
terms
of
purple
haze
or
turbo
dog
as
i
most
certainly
did
prior
to
drinking
this
d
definitialy
one
of
the
better
beers
that
abita
is
putting
out
pretty
good
for
the
style
worth
trying
sometie
grab
an
abita
abbey
if
youre
looking
to
try
a
unique
abbey
style
ale
its
delicious
verdict
it
may
have
a
hard
time
competing
with
the
belgian
originals
but
abita
have
brewed
up
a
pretty
damn
decent
dubbel
here
just
watch
out
for
the
well
hidden
alcohol
punch
allinall
a
good
dubbel
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
not
overwhelming
alcohol
profile
id
get
it
again
but
i
cant
put
it
with
my
favorites
this
is
an
excellent
abbey
ale
the
color
was
a
deepgolden
with
hues
of
orange
the
smell
of
soft
malts
and
hops
had
a
magnificent
aroma
the
taste
had
a
sweet
maltiness
and
mild
hops
flavor
overall
fruity
aroma
soft
sweet
maltiness
and
just
a
pleasant
tasting
ale
one
of
abitas
better
beers
served
in
a
chalice
from
a
nicely
painted
bottle
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
thick

fruity
aroma
taste
is
also
dominated
by
a
fruity
raisiny
type
of
character
along
with
a
biscuity
malt
and
very
little
bitterness
not
the
most
complex
dubbel
ive
tasted
but
certainly
a
strong
effort
by
a
brewery
ive
never
associated
with
belgian
styles

nothing

just
an
easy

beginner
friendly
belgian

brew
with
a
well
hidden
8
jolt
a
fair
bit
of
character
to
this
one
perhaps
not
the
layered
complexity
of
some
of
the
better
examples
but
the
important
elements
are
there
its
got
the
pleasant
light
body
and
hidden
alcohol
of
a
good
dubbel
so
at
least
its
readily
drinkable
not
a
bad
drop
at
all
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
good
ale
and
i
enjoy
the
flavors
that
are
present
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
starts
out
great
and
finishes
alright
the
appearance
is
a
nice
dark
caramel
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
the
scent
is
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
just
average
thats
the
surprise
the
smell
and
appearance
lead
me
to
expect
a
full
bodied
malty
taste
this
brew
has
a
light
taste
that
has
no
hop
bite
or
any
other
flavors
that
hit
the
back
of
the
tongue
all
of
the
taste
is
felt
on
the
front
half
of
the
mouth
the
short
finish
makes
the
beer
an
easy
one
to
drink
you
wouldnt
know
that
it
was
8
overall
its
a
really
nice
abbeystyle
beer
a
little
bit
more
depth
of
character
to
the
maltiness
perhaps
a
stronger
hint
of
cocoa
or
soft
milk
chocolate
would
be
great
and
a
tighter
focus
on
the
balance
softening
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
smoothing
the
sweetness
at
the
outset
eliminating
the
minor
vegetal
note
would
make
this
quite
nice
drinkable
though
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
cloaked
worth
trying
drinkability
is
nice
decent
balance
unbalanced
towards
sweetness
but
hiding
its
alcohol
fairly
well
just
not
a
very
exciting

a
nice
amount

the

but
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
as
is
the
case
with
most
abita
beers
the
beer
is
medium

with
some

this
one
ended
up
being
just
about
what
i
expected

at
a
belgian
a
pretty
decent
dubbel
that
is
worth
a
try
nothing
spectacular
though
flavor
is
decidedly
better
than
the
aroma

with
notes
of
toasted

somewhat

overall
a
solid
belgian
interpretation
from
abita
recommended
but
ill
likely
pass
on
this
in
the
future
with
so
many
better
options

but
not
a

to

the
abbey
ale
pours
with
a
decent
head
and
looks
nice
the
aroma
is
a
bit
offputting
though
i
appreciate
the
phenolic
character
of
some
belgian
yeasts
and
theres
some
of
that
goodness
in
this
brew
but
theres
also
some
bad
phenols
as
well
for
reference
i
would
say
chimay
red
or
blue
has
a
very
good
phenolic
character
the
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
but
the
bad
phenols
are
still
there
this
is
an
interesting
attempt
at
an
abbey
ale
and
one
that
almost
works
but
ultimately
it
needs
more
finesse
much
like
the
andygator
the
flavors
in
this
brew
dont
quite
gel
and
makes
me
think
the
recipe
needs
more
time
to
work
out
the
kinks
well
to
be
honest
i
had
andygator
a
number
of
years
ago
when
it
was
still
draftonly
i
thought
it
was
odd
if
not
off
back
then
and
i
still
think
it
tastes
the
same
in
the
new
bottled
form
odd
whatever
the
case
this
abbey
ale
is
a
better
abita
beer
than
most
other
abita
brews
out
there
hey
abita
im
still
pulling
for
you
seriously
keep
trying
with
the
special
release
bomber
series
i
still
have
faith
that
you
guys
can
make
some
killer
brews
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
dubbel
especially
for
the
price

very
nice
malt
forward
example
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
copper
with
fluffy
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
strong
wild
belgian
yeast
and
salt
with
banana
and
apricot
and
vinegar
and
a
bit
of
earthy
caramel
it
tasted
like
sour
wild
yeast
and
salt
and
apricot
with
some
banana
and
nutty
malt
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
clean
flavor
but
it
wasnt
very
enjoyable
for
my
tastes
with
a
dominent
sour
character
to
me
dubbels
should
be
maltier
it
had
good
body
and
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
this
wasnt
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
fit
the
style
and
it
definitely
isnt
the
type
of
belgian
ale
i
personally
prefer
thanks
to
deepsouth
for
this
extra
in
a
trade
nice
painted
label
bottle
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
was
gone
quickly
leaving
sparse
lacing
aroma
is
belgian
yeast
clove
caramel
light
chocolate
notes
bready
warm
flavor
is
nice
good
amount
of
belgian
yeast
some
burnt
toffee
and
caramel
a
touch
of
chocolate
light
raisin
dark
fruit
light
spiciness
not
really
complex
but
cant
complain
it
tastes
good
alcohol
is
a
little
too
prevalent
though
a
bit
thin
on
the
tongue
alcohol
warmth
is
there
but
its
fairly
well
integrated
a
nice
take
on
the
style
this
isnt
a
bad
dubbel
i
find
most
beers
from
abita
to
be
pretty
average
but
this
is
a
solid
try
at
a
dubbel
and
i
liked
it
better
than
allagash
dubbel
overall
i
can
definitely
see
buying
this
on
occasion
as
something
of
a
treat
for
my
boyfriend
who
likes
the
sweet
belgianstyle
beers
a
lot
but
doesnt
have
the
worlds
most
discriminating
palate
in
fact
i
might
let
him
have
the
other
half
of
this
one
not
because
its
at
all
bad
but
because
i
suspect
hed
very
much
love
it
dgood
but
not
quite
sessionable
a
little
to
sweet
d
overal
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
has
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations
recommended
a
deep
amber
color
more
like
a
light
mohoganey
with
a
thick
half
inch
high
head
top
the
head
lasts
substatially
long
and
clings
to
the
glass
for
some
time
the
scent
of
malt
is
strong
with
bread
like
fragrances
the
yeast
brings
it
spiciness
and
fruity
esters
along
for
the
ride
the
taste
has
the
malt
at
the
front
almost
like
a
spicy
bread
touches
of
sweet
spices
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
dried
fruit
i
am
tasting
some
chocolate
dont
why
but
i
am
it
then
ends
mild
earthy
bitterness
a
creamy
texture
at
the
front
thinning
itself
out
as
it
rolls
across
the
palate
a
mild
dry
finish
on
the
back
end
with
slight
crispness
to
follow
the
flavors
do
not
seem
to
meld
together
though
the
look
and
feel
are
very
appealing
taste
is
what
makes
a
beer
there
are
just
to
many
things
going
on
in
the
taste
that
hamper
this
beer
from
becoming
a
very
good
one
hmmm
dont
quite
know
what
to
think
of
this
one
some
recognizable
dubbel
qualities
and
some
other
flavors
i
particuarly
care
for
considerably
better
as
it
warmed
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
yeasty
with
malt
the
appearance
is
amber
with
with
an
average
head
the
flavor
is
average
too
despite
tasting
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
overall
it
is
better
than
average
but
not
by
a
lot
this
is
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
too
much
again
abita
brews
a
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
could
have
been
better
while
i
cannot
say
i
wont
buy
it
again
it
wont
be
on
top
of
the
list
of
course
thats
a
moot
point
until
i
get
back
to
louisiana
overall
this
is
a
solid
dubbel
and
one
of
the
better
abita
brews
ive
had
worth
a
shot
d
ive
been
pretty
underwhelmed
by
most
of
abitas
brews
so
far
but
this
is
a
respectable
american
shot
at
a
belgian
dubbel
easy
to
drink
and
visually
appealing
for
3
99
a
bomber
not
too
hard
on
the
wallet
either
this
is
an
excellent
dubbel
on
par
with
the
best
belgian
ones
recommended
poured
out
of
its
22
oz
bottle
cold
into
a
nonchilled
chalice
glass
appears
a
very
nice
ambergolden
color
head
is
thick
with
a
creamy
texture
and
offwhite
pale
color
smells
like
a
yeasty
strong
dubbel
cloves
and
spices
dominate
the
scent
which
is
accompanied
by
a
hint
of
sweetness
you
do
smell
the
alcohol
also
the
taste
is
surprisingly
alot
like
the
smell
in
that
its
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
other
dubbels
out
there
which
was
a
bit
strange
to
me
but
not
at
all
offputting
alcohol
is
pronounced
as
well
as
the
yeasts
and
roasted
malts
has
a
real
hearty
earthy
quality
about
it
this
brew
also
has
a
nice
bitter
and
spiciness
to
it
with
some
subtle
fruitiness
though
not
really
in
a
sweet
way
i
thought
it
tasted
better
as
it
warmed
slightly
the
body
was
pretty
thick
medium
to
almost
heavy
i
liked
the
thickness
and
the
creamy
head
stayed
and
lazily
trickled
down
the
edges
of
the
glass
as
drank
it
despite
being
rather
thick
it
was
very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
belgians
of
any
style
i
would
also
agree
with
some
other
reviewers
in
that
this
seems
more
like
a
tripel
than
dubbel
a
fine
offering
from
abita
probably
the
best
specialty
beer
they
have
done
yet
easy
to
drink
with
the
8
alcohol
seeming
somewhat
tame
definetly
worth
a
try
for
the
style
and
the
price
first
time
with
this
brewer
poured
a
clear
copper
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
decent
lacing
sweet
yeast
and
herbal
aroma
with
a
malty
gingerbread
scent
thick
but
not
syrupy
mouthfeel
stronger
than
expected
in
the
spiciness
again
like
gingerbread
a
noticeable
clove
and
banana
flavor
as
well
turns
sweet
and
fruity
towards
the
finish
no
heavy
malt
or
sugar
flavors
i
expected
with
a
dubbel
leans
more
towards
a
trippel
in
spice
and
yeast
i
liked
it
pours
a
very
nice
two
finger
tan
head
but
it
disappears
pretty
quick
no
stickage
a
tawny
and
rose
colored
amber
brown
with
some
ok
tiny
bubbles
caramelized
sugar
toffee
yeasty
fruit
and
some
warm
alcohol
toasted
malts
with
a
little
caramel
and
a
some
hot
alcohol
that
cuts
through
yeasty
fruits
and
herbal
hops
the
malt
thins
out
quickly
and
finishes
on
moreof
a
boozey
note
than
any
thing
else
pretty
hot
palate
especially
as
the
beer
warms
this
one
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
belgian
style
it
is
surprisingly
sessionable
d
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
freind
as
a
drinkable
beer
pretty
decent
atmosphere
nose
is
complex
and
spread
out
but
really
balanced
with
a
nice
collections
of
malty
and
sweet
aromas
flavor
also
offers
complexity
and
great
balance
it
is
sweet
and
syrupy
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
balanced
with
a
spicy
pungency
and
mitigated
by
a
strong
alcohol
feel
aftertaste
stands
out
but
is
not
arresting
great
quaff
i
had
never
seen
an
abita
beer
in
a
22
ounce
bottle
before
my
only
experience
with
their
beers
was
the
turbodog
at
one
of
emerils
restaurants
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
would
like
to
see
what
else
these
guys
are
planning
to
do
drinks
great
for
the
style
abv
maybe
the
single
best
beer
ive
had
from
these
guys
i
always
thought
their
mainstream
stuffwas
well
too
damn
middle
of
the
road
this
one
rocks
well
done
abita
pours
a
huge
foamy
yellowish
colored
head
big
bubbles
very
clear
medium
brown
body
good
lacing
sticks
to
the
sides
very
bready
banana
some
clove
in
the
aroma
very
floral
strong
banana
and
some
spices
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
too
very
creamy
mouthfeel
some
light
sweetness
floral
taste
but
very
light
tasting
pretty
drinkable
letting
it
warm
up
a
bit
still
very
light
and
floral
very
typical
of
a
belgian
style
beer
they
hit
it
on
the
head
with
this
one
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
too
much
of
i
like
this
a
lot
more
than
ratings
may
indicate
it
needs
a
lot
of
warmth
to
fully
get
to
normalcy
but
this
like
the
drunk
absentminded
professor
on
speed
and
coke
trying
to
grade
a
bunch
of
finals
probably
not
a
styleperfect
example
but
this
is
entertaining
and
enjoyable
stuff
good
to
see
abita
do
something
a
little
over
the
edge
while
it
may
not
be
as
agreeable
as
its
belgian
counterparts
i
believe
this
may
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
an
americanmade
dubbel
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
pours
a
hazy
ruddy
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
very
slight
lacing
aroma
is
slightly
carmally
and
slightly
belgian
yeast
phenolic
taste
is
like
a
caramel
covered
prune
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
a
belgian
style
dubbel
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
beer
just
an
average
dubbel
with
not
much
character
hats
off
to
abita
i
did
not
expect
them
to
deliver
at
this
level
with
the
new
big
beer
series
they
have
done
a
very
nice
job
i
wish
there
were
more
dubbels
of
this
pedigree
in
the
us
yes
the
belgian
specialists
hit
well
but
too
few
others
try
this
is
an
americanized
version
of
the
style
but
it
works
quite
well
appearance
is
opaque
dark
amber
with
bright
red
hues
i
poured
a
2finger
tan
head
with
minimal
lacing
it
smells
of
caramel
malts
yeast
allspice
cloves
and
dark
fruitsperfect
smell
for
a
dubbel
unfortunately
the
taste
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
smell
the
flavor
is
dark
fruits
yeast
some
spice
but
theres
an
odd
bitter
medicinal
aftertaste
that
many
abita
offerings
have
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
acidic
kick
at
the
end
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
the
tastemouthfeel
just
dont
live
up
to
some
of
the
better
dubbels
d
would
be
ideal
with
a
cigar
a
nice
effort
by
abita
mouth
feel
is
thick
with
yeast
and
approaching
sticky

good
drinkability
a
solid
beer
over
all
this
might
not
be
the
best
dubble
ever
made
but
it
is
still
exceptional
probably
the
best
beer
from
abita
that
i
have
tried
something
i
would
recommend
a
decent
beer
that
comes
out
better
than
most
american
attempts
at
the
style
but
still
lacking
complexity
balance
and
restraint
that
make
belgian
abbey
ales
the
best
beers
in
the
world
the
taste
is
spiced
up
with
herbal
hop
notes
slight
roasted
character
and
peet
smooth
fruit
finish
with
some
faint
hops
in
the
finish
good
beer
drinkability
its
nice
typically
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
their
offerings
but
this
is
actually
an
admirable
shot
at
a
dubbel
by
abita
drinkability
a
pretty
good
dubbel
i
tend
to
like
em
a
little
less
olivey
and
a
little
sweeter
but
this
is
nice
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
with
slight
carbonation
the
alcohol
starts
to
become
more
noticeable
midway
through
bringing
down
drinkability
a
little
bit
still
this
is
something
i
would
like
to
have
again
overall
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
from
a
brewery
that
really
hasnt
produced
anything
all
that
special
in
my
book
this
is
easily
my
favorite
offering
from
abita
and
i
hope
theyll
take
the
hint
and
start
bottling
some
of
their
other
select
brews
in
the
future
drinkability
is
low
because
of
the
alcohol
taste
you
have
to
be
too
careful
with
this
when
the
flavor
isnt
up
to
par
nicely
done
abita
i
poured
the
abbey
ale
into
a
chimay
glass
it
is
an
amber
color
and
had
a
medium
sized
head
with
good
lacing
the
smell
was
decently
complex
it
seemed
to
be
a
nice
mix
of
sour
and
sweetness
i
could
smell
some
fruits
in
there
as
well
what
appeared
to
be
banana
and
plum
while
drinking
the
beer
i
noticed
it
was
a
bit
milder
it
is
a
bit
tangy
and
sweet
with
a
little
banana
coming
through
the
mouthfeel
is
better
than
in
most
abita
beers
its
still
just
a
tad
too
thin
but
the
carbonation
is
decent
it
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
and
the
best
abita
makes
d
this
is
a
good
american
attempt
at
a
belgian
comes
at
a
great
price
but
to
me
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
in
a
dubbel
but
still
a
good
stab
from
abita
rivals
the
ipa
as
my
favorite
beer
from
them
overall
i
plan
on
buying
this
one
a
lot
especially
with
the
price
i
got
it
at
being
at
3
69
for
the
bomber
it
is
a
refreshing
dubbel
that
still
carries
a
complexity
and
spiciness
to
it
i
dont
think
id
say
its
an
incredible
dubbel
but
it
still
is
pretty
tasty
i
am
finding
myself
drinking
this
one
rather
quickly
the
presence
of
alcohol
is
low
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
with
a
two
finger
tan
foam
cap
decent
retention
and
lacing
smells
strongly
of
yeast
and
bananadate
esters
as
well
as
a
good
bit
of
doughy
malt
and
some
spice
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
tangy
yeast
as
well
as
more
banana
and
quite
a
bit
of
spiciness
medicinal
phenols
are
almost
overwhelming
at
times
some
bitterness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
slightly
syrupy
the
phenols
make
it
somewhat
unpleasant
to
put
down
had
this
at
lagers
and
it
was
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
not
a
proper
pour
or
glass
so
rating
is
not
a
truly
proper
rating
they
will
be
bottling
this
in
january
2009
so
will
do
another
review
then
overall
though
the
beer
was
great
and
the
alcohol8
was
masked
extremely
well
perhaps
a
little
too
well
as
i
had
three
and
was
feeling
pretty
good
but
had
to
drive
home
i
made
a
recent
visit
to
the
brewpub
in
abita
springs
and
had
this
ontap
along
with
a
cask
doppelbock
and
satsuma
wit
this
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
instead
of
a
goblet
but
i
rarely
get
proper
glassware
anywhere
had
a
nice
aroma
of
dark
fruit
taste
was
similar
to
the
aroma
little
carbonation
head
or
lacing
and
mouthfeel
was
correct
for
the
style
hid
the
alcohol
fairly
well
good
beer
definitely
check
this
one
out
if
you
come
across
it
on
tap
in
s
la
and
look
for
the
bottles
in
2009
sometimes
nice
finish
great
balance
throughout
not
too
exciting
though
as
expected
good
beer
not
a
fun
of
beers
too
sweet
but
this
one
got
good
balance
poured
into
snifter
hazy
dark
brown
beer
with
a
ring
of
golden
head
spicy
aroma
with
prunes
toffee
candy
sugar
taste
of
dark
fruits
wheat
yeasts
medium
body
prickly
carbonation
decent
dubbel
o
overall
this
wasnt
too
bad
it
might
be
one
of
the
worst
dubbels
that
ive
tried
before
but
thats
only
because
i
have
high
standards
nonetheless
its
not
worth
the
price
to
me
for
a
few
dollars
more
or
a
few
dollars
less
unibroue
i
could
be
in
a
belgian
heaven
right
now
instead
im
only
content
overall
its
got
great
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
both
hit
and
miss
i
could
do
without
the
port
wine
notes
and
the
tartness
is
almost
too
much
at
times
almost
medicinal
so
for
a
dubbel
its
good
but
not
up
there
with
the
best
a
little
bit
disappointed
esp
with
the
world
beer
award
insignia
on
the
label
d
once
is
good
for
this
one
overall
4
0
this
is
another
unique
take
on
the
standard
belgian
dark
and
it
is
nonetheless
still
outstanding
balanced
smooth
and
very
refreshing
in
spite
of
its
big
abv
this
beer
is
excellent
for
sessioning
or
simply
trying
the
style
definitely
a
gateway
beer
into
the
wider
and
more
apocalyptic
realm
of
belgian
darks
the
path
hath
been

before
you
pilgrim
here
there
be
dragons
ugly
dark
purplebrown
beer
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
leaving
no
lacing
behind
the
fizzing
is
very
loud
pours
almost
like
a
soda
smells
like
sweet
raisin
bread
with
some
caramel
apple
notes
tastes
sweet
and
fizzy
strong
raspberry
soda
flavor
that
gives
way
to
the
more
bready
malt
character
that
has
hints
of
raisins
plums
dates
tangy
finish
surprisingly
dry
scary
drinkable
for
9
an
unusual
beer
to
me
as
it
warms
it
seems
to
get
thicker
with
a
dark
cherry
flavor
and
a
stronger
alcohol
bite
the
fizziness
is
very
distracting
and
makes
this
seem
almost
like
beer
soda
this
is
fairly
odd
and
would
dare
the
risk
takers
to
try
this
beer
with
bbq
tritip
this
is
a
decent
and
flavorful
dubbel
but
rather
coarse
and
weak
with
the
mouthfeel
certainly
not
bad
but
not
necessarily
a
musthave
overall
it
was
a
decent
brew
i
wasnt
very
impressed
but
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
murky

with
a
foamy
khaki

sugar
dark
fruits
and
spices
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
overall
a
little
too
sweet
although
i
like
the
sweeter
brews
normally
i
think
its
rich
and
filling
and
is
a
decent
brew
but

are

1

i
ever
spent
this
had
some
real
potential
the
nose
is
superb
i
think
i
could
have
gotten
more
out
of
it
if
i
hadnt
had
the
st
feuillien
wit
before
the
acidity
got
to
my
tongue
the
big
set
up
by
the
aroma
was
a
terrible
let
down
in
the
taste
as
the
metallic
aftertaste
really
just
stripped
any
complexity
or
richness
that
the
aroma
and
front
end
of
the
taste
promised
im
kinda
mad
a
this
beer
really
it
could
have
been
a
contender
im
going
to
try
this
from
a
bottle
to
see
if
maybe
the
lines
at
the
refuge
were
to
blame
im
staying
hopeful
i
guess
mvery
drinkable
which
could
be
dangerous
overall
the
elements
for
a
good
dubbel
are
here
but
the
execution
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
unfortunately
another
average
offering
from
st
martin
they
represent
the
styles
that
they
do
relatively
well
but
again
nothing
sets
this
one
apart
from
your
standard
dubbel
an
attractive
beer
that
reveals
a
slightly
simpler
side
when
you
get
to
know
it
but
never
lets
you
down
and
keeps
you
content
the
entire
time
you
are
together
which
is
something
you
really
cannot
find
too
much
fault
with
o
solid
but
honestly
a
bit
forgettable
lacks
some
expected
complexity
but
is
more
refreshing
as
a
trade
off
especially
since
the
finish
is
so
clean
a
little
age
adds
a
nice
character
to
the
finish

red
with
a
three
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
two

really
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
bread
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
bread
plum
raisins
and
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
really
liked
how
complex
the
flavor
was
on
this
one
for
a
dubbel
however
at
8
you
definitely
would
have
thought
it
was
much
higher
due
to
the
flavors
of
alcohol
you
got
off
of
it
the
aroma
was
a
little
weak
in
comparison
to
the
flavor
but
was
still
pretty
nice
a
definite
must
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
overall
this
isnt
bad
its
a
pretty
good
dubbel
but
not
spectacular
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head

the
color
of

the
aroma
is
candy
sugar
with
a
lot
of
toffee
malt
and
a
tad
bit
of
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
some
sweet
candy
sugarbrown
sugar
notes
as
well
as
some
caramel
and
toffee
the
alcohol
is
definitely
detectable
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
high
prickly
carbonation
a
decent
dubbel
but
not
one
of
the
best
abbey
st
martin
browns
first
taste
is
rich
roasted
malts
followed
closely
by
dark
fruits
which
are
relatively
restrained
the
beer
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
is
refreshing
for
a
dubbel
with
moderate
carbonation
its
eminently
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
if
its
been
around
since
1096

ma
im
not
so
sure
about
this
one
the
color
was
a
deep
murky
brown
color
the
taste
had
this
strange
sweetness
to
it
but
it
also
had
a
bit
of
a
dirt
like
flavor
too
this
dubbel
doesnt
really
hit
home
for
me
its
not
the
most
refreshing
abbey
dubbel
ive
ever
had
and
not
much
above
average
either
i
think
i
can
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
from
now
on
at
the
store
found
this
one
at
the
apparently
discounted
price
of
29
for
a
case
of
33cl
bottles
which
is
the
only
reason
that
i
tried
it
suspiciously

to
be

refreshingly
thin

dry
on

just
a
bit
meaty
and
metallic
not
unpleasant
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
despite
8
abv
considering
price
it
ranks
as
a
very
good
beer
although
probably
a
middle
of

road

a

thinner
than
the
norm
average
pours
a
dark

w
a
two

caramel
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
that
of
malt
fruit
sweetness
and
a
kind
of
metallic
smell
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
single
handedly
takes
the
smell
score
down
a
notch
or
two
fortunately
i
dont
taste
that
particular
thing
sweet

malt

alcohol
are
present
in
the
taste
a
little
thin
tasting
for
what
id
prefer
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
but
a
little
thin
for
me
malt
in
the
aftertaste
which
quickly
goes
away
drinkability
isnt
bad
ive
had
the
st
martins
tripel
and
i
think
thats
a
better
effort
still
not
bad
and
glad
i
got
to
finally
try
this
one
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
real
big
on
the
drinkability
score
in
the
final
analysis
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
beer
you
could
also
do
a
lot
better
colalike
as
opposed
to
the
creamy
fullness
of
the
better
belgian
dubbels
date
and
raisin
pecan
and
walnut
toffee
and
light
chocolate
notes
not
too
bad
but
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
i
gave
it
a
4
5
on
drinkability
just
because
it
is
8
if
it
was
4
which
it
kind
of
tastes
like
you
could
throw
these
down
all
nice
they
go
down
really
easy
not
as
deep
or
complex
as
expected
very
drinkable
though
worth
a
go
d
not
the
best
drinkability
could
be
much
more
flavorful
but
its
drinkable
when
i
reach
for
a
belgian
which
isnt
often
i
want
a
really
flavorful
tasty
one
this
fell
short
first
review
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
fizzy
amount
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
belgian
this
is
very
mild
and
slightly
watery
the
flavors
arent
too
complex
but
are
very
faint
got
this
the
same
day
as
the
tripel
a
while
ago
might
as
well
drink
em
the
same
day
today
this
one
pours

a
halffinger
of

the
nose

maple
syrup
dark
wheat
figs
brown

and
a

cocoa
the
taste
waters
down
the
syrup
does
away
with
the
cocoa
and
emphasizes
the
wheat
and
figs
some
raisins
are
thrown
in
for
good
measure
as
well
the
body
is
a
steady
almost
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
grainy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
dubbel
maybe
not
the
paragon
of

definitely
a
nice

drinker

light

a

the

unsatisfying
beer
from
the

wont
be

any
again

at
the
ridiculous

definite
belgian
funk
adding
some
dried
fruit
and
spice
a
bit
of
clove
maybe
cinnamon
to
a
whole
wheat
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
vapor
flavor
starts
out
with
brown
sugar
sweetness
that
is
cleansed
by
hop
bitterness
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
sour
the
beer
tastes
a
lot
less
full
that
it
is
probably
due
to
the
hops
touch
of
sour
and
the
significant
alcohol
presence
certainly
not
the
most
complex
belgian
style
brew
on
the
market
by
why
does
it
have
to
be
it
does
what
it
does
quite
well
and
scores
a

more
points
in
the

column
than

8

though
trying

the

a

in

it

a
dark
nutty
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
just
keeps
going
and
going
and
going
this
ones
a
bit
hazy
because
of
all
the
bubbles
encased
in
the
beverage
the
nose
is
a
bit
underwhelming
but
there
are
hints
of
that
familiar
belgian
dubbel
dark
fruitiness
along
with
some
dark
malt
and
sweet
sugary
characteristics
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
bit
odd
but
i
really
like
it
its
not
as
sweet
and
fruity
as
most
belgian
dubbels
instead
its
more
like
a
strong
american
brown
ale
without
the
overthetop
hoppiness
i
admit
its
very
refreshing
to
taste
this
and
i
clearly
want
more
like
it
it
is
a
tad
overcarbonated
for
my
tastesometimes
i
find
myself
fighting
through
the
bubbles
to
get
to
some
flavor
its
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
may
be
a
sort
of
gateway
beer
for
new
initiates
into
the
belgian
beer
experience
cheers
notes
though
it
is
by
no
means
rare
this
seems
to
be
the

beer
ive
reviewed
and
maybe
even
tried
in
fact
i
havent
had
a
legitimate
belgian
brew
before

from

by
the
way
the
aforementioned
dark
triple
was
definitely
a
notch
above
this
one
would
prefer
the
tripel
style
and
im
sure
there
are
better
readily
available
examples
of
the
dubbel
than
this
was
a
neat
experience
to
purchase
and
try
though
drinkability
an
interesting
belgian
good
for
what
it
is
simple
flavors
that
work
well
i
love
dubbels
but
there
are
much
more
desirable
examples
out
there
i
relate
st
martin
brune
to
a
lot
of
movies
ive
seen
it
was
worth
sitting
through
once
but
not
really
a
second
time
i
liked
it
alright
it
was
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
recommend
it
to
others
final
review
one
thumb
up
one
thumb
sideways
this
wasnt
bad
but
doesnt
really
compare
to
other
belgian
beers
for
either
taste
or
aroma
the
beer
has
a
nice
deep
copper
color
but
the
smell
borders
on
metallic
not
yeasty
like
a
typical
belgian
the
flavor
is
also
a
bit
one
dimension
and
thin
with
neither
the
yeastiness
one
expects
from
this
variety
nor
the
roasted
sweetness
typical
of
dark
beers
this
would
probably
be
fairly
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
have
too
many
of
them
based
on
the
quality
of
beer
for
the
price
flying
dog
even
does
belgians
a
lot
better
than
this
one
not
to
mention
chimay

saint
bernardus
duvel

the
flavour
has
notes
of

but
this
is
probably
the
driest
dubbel
i
have
ever
had
dust
in

very
moderate

the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
would
have
guessed
that

not

definitely
drinkable
but
far
from
exciting
d
good
for

nothing

about
it

not

i
would
look

to
buying
again

no

at
all
rather
quickly
nose
has
plenty
of
dark
fruits
and
strongly
suggests
it
will
be
a
dessert
beer
for
sure
on
the

the
dark

component
is

with
plenty
of

rather
nice

some

like
must

in
the

finish
is
sweet
and
reminds
me
of
figs
d
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
brag
about
but
that
being
said
it
is
quite
drinkable
a
good
beer
d
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
the

the

favours
the

the

certainly
would

it
isnt

the

this
is
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
but
i
dont
think
that
ill
be
coming
back
to
it
this
isnt
one
id
seek
out
just
nothing
all
that
great
about
it
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
7
2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
the
beer
poured
a
dark
cloudy
reddishbrown
colour
with
a
tan
coloured
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
some
yeast
and
raisins
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
highcarbonation
almost
champagnelike
the
flavour
was
also
sweet
malt
with
a
definite
alcoholic
taste
in
back
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
musty
aroma
that
i
find
all
their
beers
have

is
much
lighter
than
expected
mild

down

better
bruins
out
there
r
although
very
tasty
the
abbey
de
saintmartin
brune
just
did
not
impress
me
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
theres
something
about
its
cheap
packaging
and
its
overall
execution
that
doesnt
do
it
for
me
ill
still
judge
it
fairly
worth
a
try
poured
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
very
bubbly
but
not
much
flowing
towards
the
nose
i
couldnt
pin
down
anything
the
first
taste
is
of
raisins
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
it
right
away
i
hate
eating
raisins
and
havent
had
one
since
i
was
a
small
child
so
it
took
a
minute
to
figure
that
one
out
after
that
the
carbonation
took
over
and
the
flavors
were
muted
of
course
not
really
any
detection
of
alcohol
which
made
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
the
beer
was
good
but
in
my
experience
the
carbonation
in
this
style
has
usually
heightened
the
aromas
and
flavors
and
this
one
ended
up
being
flat
poured
an
orangey
light
brown
into
a
sampler

with
a
slightly
grey
fluffy
head
big
thing
with
this
one
is
the
excellent
mouthfeel
flavour
is
mild
chocolate
and
cocoa
quite
deep
and
dark
for
a
dubbel
but
very
nice
some
raisins
in
there
and
mild
sour
notes
as
it
gets
warmer
aftertaste
is
just
a
little
off
although
im
not
sure
if
i
can
describe
it
really
nice
although
im
biased
as
ive
never
found
a
dubbel
i
didnt
like
much
lighter
in
complexity
in
the
mouth
which
may
be
a
culprit
of
over
carbonation
the
beer
has
a
very
prickly
carbonation
that
blasts
the
tastebuds
and
makes
things
hard
to
comprehend
caramel
notes
with
very
minor
milk
chocolate
accents
with
much
less
pronounced
dried

mainly
dates
with

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with

solid

overall
another
rather

belgian
by
pike
i
have
had
some
good
beers
from
them
but
they
are
way
out
of
their
element
with
belgians
this
beer
would
be
better
classified
as
a
somewhat
hoppy
brown
ale
it
is
certainly
drinkable
but
lacks
the
complex
flavors
i
would
expect
in
a
dubbel
great
aroma
but
the
fruit
tartness
while
nice
seems
to
take
away
from
the
malt
nothing
complex
but
has
an
interesting
character
o
this
is
not
a
dubbel
its
a
hoppy
brown
ale
good
but
not
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
od
way
too
spicy
for
me
for
a
dubbel
this
doesnt
seem
to
work
at
all
yet
after
some
time
the
fruit
and
sugar
flavours
came
through
more
but
still
if
i
wasnt
bored
i
would
have
poured
this
out
pretty
quick
off
for
a
dubbel
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
sucked
it
down
a
little
too
fast
with
dinner
i
wouldnt
say
it
follows
the
belgian
dubble
style
perfectly
but
it
is
certainly
a
good
beer
there
was
a
strong
and
unpleasant
funky
aroma
thats
unlike
anything
i
have
smelled
ever
the
taste
was
terrible
i
couldnt
even
comfortably
drink
a
sip
without
grimacing
it
was
so
bad
that
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
poured
down
the
drain
taste
is
candi
sugar
dark
fruits
caramel
and
theres
a
very
smooth
slightly
sweet
finish
light
carbonation
and
a
fruity
finish
make
is
very
well
done
i
really
like
the
brewery
but
this
bottle
really
didnt
hit
the
spot
o
an
odd
little
dubbel
pike
did
a
pretty
good
job
though
i
suppose
some
nice
potential
here
but
the
beer
came
across
a
little
watereddown
would
have
been
very
good
with
a
little
more
body
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
with
a
rich

it

is

a
taste
if
you
want
something
close
to
it

a

and
a

to
me
a
little
on
the
light
side
taste
is
of
the
caramel
malt
and
some
dark
fruit
malt
may
go
as
far
as
being
slightly
roasty
little
if
any
yeast
notes
maybe
just
a
touch
of
ester
but
it
is
limited
mouthfeel
is
quite
lively
with
only
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
enough
to
balance
the
slightly
sweet
finish
overall
not
a
bad
dubbel
not
my
favorite
example
but
it
is
quite
accessible
and
enjoyable
o
overall
a
tasty
offering
and
worth
taking
for
a
spin
offers
some
unique
flavours
and
is
quite
drinkable
the
bitterness
that
lingers
alongside
the
spices
might
be
a
bit
much
for
some
people
but
i
quite
enjoyed
it
poured
this
and
has
the
look
of
cocacola
heavy
brown
that
is
not
transparent
thin

with
a

covering

and
toffee
are
noticeable
flavor
is
deep
with

warm
alcohol
toffee
and
an
oakiness
a
little
bit
of
spiceness
a
full
bodied
ale
that
is
chewy
in
the
mouth
overall
a
good
heavy
beer
that
is
worthy
of
another
purchase
opinion
overall
this
is
unusual
for
a
dubbel
thats
for
sure
it
isnt
a
disgusting
beer
or
anything
and
may
pass
for
some
version
of
an
american
brown
ale
in
the
aroma
while
really
just
ending
up
as
an
estery
unbalanced
mess
in
the
flavor
i
havent
cared
for
this
beer
to
say
the
least
i
really
think
that
it
is
just
an
american
brown
recipe
stepped
up
with
some
tworow
and
fermented
with
belgian
yeast
i
have
been
pretty
disappointed
with
this
beer
you
would
think
that
if
they
were
going
to
go
through
the
trouble
of
putting
out
a
belgian
style
beer
like
this
that
they
would
want
to
come
remotely
close
to
the
style
i
guess
this
is
a
beer
brewed
for
some
offthewall
category
in
the
gabf
with
no
intention
of
ever
holding
water
to
any
of
the
real
classic
examples
of
this
style
stay
away
from
this
beer
if
you
like
dubbels
if
you
like
hotlyestery
fermented
american
brown
ales
give
this
a
shot
drinkability
the
individual
components
of
this
ale
were
enjoyable
but
taken
together
i
thought
they
missed
their
mark
a
dark
brownish
orange
aroma
is
biscuitymalt
a
little
must
flavor
is
more
rich
malt
but
not
much
of
that
belgian
funk
or
spice
you
expect
from
a
double
there
are
hints
of
bakers
chocolate
and
maybe
some
died
fruits
but
its
more
malt
and
biscuit
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
drinks
well
and
can
be
sessioned
just
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
drinkability
good
and
likely
to
pair
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
reincarnated
into
a
dubbel
this
brew
is
dark
and
opaque
the
lacing
is
sufficient
enough
to
resemble
a
beer
my
nose
wafts
charred
wood
medicinal
herbs
and
vague
tropical
fruit
it
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
big
body
unsweetened
dark
chocolate
highly
toasted
bread
and
a
thick
biscuity
layer
appear
in
the
finish
and
really
show
what
the
malt
is
about
warming
fruity
alcohol
in
the
middle
with
an
herbal
phenol
character
throughout
bitterness
from
the
coriander
helps
to
balance
this
beer
it
ends
with
a
bit
of
burnt
bitter
and
malty
flavor
a
pretty
good
go
at
the
dubbel
style
but
a
bit
porterlike
a
decent
dubbel
actually
drier
than
the
usual
offerings
from
the
old
country
nicely
spiced
with
the
yeast
kept
well
in
check
good
and
drinkable
especially
as
the
yankee
juniors
get
their
asses
handed
to
them
in
buffalo
ontario
d
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
really
isnt
that
great
either
a
bit
rough
definitely
not
on
par
with
the
best
belgian
dubbels
thin
of
body
and
uneven
in
flavor
i
know
pike
can
do
better
but
this
was
still
interesting
and
satisfying
enough
that
it
was
worth
buying
drinkability
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
it
falls
short
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
dubbels
im
going
to
finish
this
bottle
without
complaint
but
i
wont
seek
this
beer
out
again
picked
up
this
bomber
at
tw
it
wasnt
thrown
to
to
me
like
a
big
fat
salmon
but
thats
ok
if
i
would
have
dropped
it
i
wouldnt
get
to
review
it
ok
then
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
huge
malt
smell
not
many
hops
mostly
fruity
esters
banana
mostly
and
backbone
poured
into
a
20
ounce
chalice
the
brew
is
a
barely
translucent
dark
red
with
a
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
lacing
is
great
for
this
abv
i
would
think
so
on
the
taste
the
big
belt
of
malt
continues
big
backbone
some
cloves
come
through
with
some
late
caramel
and
still
later
pumpkin
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
good
carbonation
and
viscosity
a
hint
before
syrup
this
is
a
beer
my
friends
and
for
the
price
its
a
weener
aroma
is
not
strong
but
fruity
with
an
undertone
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
caramel
it
pours
a
nice
dark
translucent
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
finebubbled
pale
tan
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
flavor
is
fruity
and
malty
with
caramel
and
nutty
hints
and
a
whisper
of
sweetness
texture
is
smooth
but
just
a
little
fizzy
not
particularly
distinguished
worthy
of
at
least
a
try
tandem
is
supposed
to
be
an
abbey
dubbel
but
it
doesnt
really
do
a
good
job
there
are
the
raisin
jammy
flavors
and
some
orange
but
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
spicy
clove
intense
fruitiness
and
overall
impact
that
good
dubbels
have
the
aroma
is
a
lacking
the
complexity
and
caramel
malts
but
appearance
is
fine
and
the
mouthfeel
good
not
a
style
i
go
to
often
but
i
like
the
pike
stuff
i
have
had
to
date
poured
into
a
goblet
a
slight
hazed
russet
brown
with
a
thinner
quick
to
fade
off
white
head
dark
fruit
and
phenolic
spice
are
the
main
components
in
the
aromasslight
sweetness
from
the
alcohol
as
well
after
the
beer
warms
alittle
big
dark
fruit
flavorsraisin
and
fig
like
others
have
notes
are
the
domianate
flavorssome
phenolic
clovelike
spice
and
even
a
hint
of
smoke
a
little
prickly
at
first
in
the
mouth
but
it
settles
down
after
a
bitits
not
bad
but
not
anything
to
go
search
out
in
my
opinion
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
drinkable
but
just
blah
not
something
i
would
probably
buy
again
d
belgianstyle
dubbels
are
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
so
i
always
get
excited
to
try
one
i
havent
before
this
one
was
a
letdown
not
horrible
but
it
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
some
of
the
top
beers
within
the
style
taste
is
woodyclove
fruitness
hint
of
toasty
grain
and
sweet
wine
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
but
pretty
balanced
the
flavours
though
not
too
complex
hold
up
well
and
it
is
a
lot
more
flaovurful
and
complex
than
quite
a
few
abbeys
that
ive
have
had
far
too
many
seeming
rather
onedimensional
this
guy
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
topped
by
a
couple
layers
of
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
brown
sugarcinnamon
light
red
grapes
and
a
touch
of
orange
flesh
the
taste
is
nearly
identical
with
a
bit
more
rye
bread
a
dash
of
pepper
and
a
smattering
of
greens
the
body
is
a
fair
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
decent
dubbel
nothing
special
but
a
nice
tasty
inexpensive
option
pours
deep
opaque
brown
with
a
dense
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
the
flavor
is
more
porterlike
than
anything
roasted
chicory
unsubtle
there
is
a
flatness
on
the
finish
the
label
promises
coriander
but
i
dont
see
it
the
mouthfeel
is
prickly
fairly
easy
drinking
and
s
nice
attempt
at
the
style
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
relatively
light
drinkable
but
not
impressive
very
drinkable
for
a
double
would
pair
well
with
food
particularly
cheese
pours
a
cloudy
mahogany
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
retains
ok
not
really
impressive
on
this
front
but
few
dubbels
are
the
aroma
has
a
bunch
of
dark
fruits
upfront
notes
of
black
cherry
raisin
plum
date
along
with
a
little
chocolate
some
caramel
and
toffee
yeasty
esters
and
a
little
alcohol
the
flavor
also
has
big
dark
fruit
notes
intially
raisin
plum
pomegranate
along
with
some
chocolate
molasses
toffee
funky
yeast
burnt
bread
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
stab
at
a
dubbel
but
lacking
the
complexity
of
the
best
iterations
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
actually
luscious
yet
at
the
same
time
seems
thin
watery
in
the
finish
visible
carbonation
is
low
as
is
the
sense
sort
of
wish
it
was
more
crisp
but
that
could
get
in
the
way
of
all
the
other
fine
points
of
the
taste
nonetheless
quite
drinkable
and
quaffable
recommended
for
yearround
celebration
and
rehydratiion
rituals
the
body
was
nicely
full
and
wellrounded
drinkability
was
very
good
ive
had
a
lot
of
these
on
tap
and
enjoyed
all
of
them
overall
a
nice
little
take
on
the

but
pike
has
done
nothing

here
d
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
it
had
a
boring
scent
and
taste
and
weak

it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
just
wasnt
rewarding
serving

drinkability
while
far
from
being
a
dumpy
dubbel
it
just
lacks
the
vibrant
maltiness
and

complexities
of
its
betters
still
at
a
modest
3
99

id
say
its
worth
a
go
drinkability
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
for
a
dubbel
mild
and
balanced
drinkability
decent
beer
but
i
would
probably
not
try
again
d
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
dubbel
other
than
westmalle
and
a
few
other
classic
examples
i
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
this
style
i
could
and
would
drink
this
one
all
the
time
if
i
lived
in
seattle
though
poured
a
deep

with
low
carbonation

a
very

with

and
light

taste
is

and
candy

half

the

is

i
did
find
some

maybe
even
green
apple
and
orange
peel
i
got
soome
booze
and
maybe
even
a

a

and
a

heavy
pretty
drinkable
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
a
solid
version
of
a
spiced
dubbel
well
worth
a
shot
the
flavor
has
a
pretty
nice
hop
presence
a
touch
tropical
and
a
bit
piney
but
the
caramel
maltiness
lacks
any
kind
of
creaminess
or
depth
the
flavor
is
not
bad
by
any
means
but
it
feels
a
bit
watery
and
just
generally
not
very
inspiring
one
nice
thing
about
this
beer
though
is
that
it
is
very
drinkable
and
hides
the
abv
well
maybe
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
on
this
beer
because
my
glass
emptied
pretty
fast
a
good
dubbel
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
pike
does
it
right
something
i
would
recommend
tandem
isnt
long
on
assertiveness
or
sustain
a
quick
bite
of
vanilla
cream
cake
easily
overtook
the
beer
for
flavor
but
tandem
is
still
worth
the
ride
interesting
beer
with
the
nose
of
white
wine
the
body
of
a
light
ale
and
all
the
funk
of
a
belgian
beer
floral
to
the
tastebuds
while
delivering
a
sensational
mood
great
beer
and
for
a
good
cause
not
terrible
but
will
not
buy
again
picked
this
up
at
the
liquor
outlet
in
boonton
i
was
expecting
a
fruity
beer
with
the
pink
label
and
plum
infusion
boy
was
i
disappointed
this
is
a
dark
heavy
beer
i
picked
up
no
fruit
notes
pours
a
dark
amber
color
good
retention
some
sediment
the
aroma
has
dark
fruits
very
much
like
a
belgian
dubbel
the
plums
used
in
the
brewing
process
are
slightly
evident
in
the
nose
and
taste
bready
malts
and
belgian
yeast
watery
dark
fruit
light
and
crisp
about
par
for
the
course
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
not
aweinspiring
but
worth
a
try
poured
a
beautiful
brown
with
garnet
hue
lovely
firm
head
nose
is
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
a
soft
bread
with
some
malty
sweetness
yeast
and
a
bit
of
pepper
plum
and
dark
fruit
like
date
floral
and
spices
too
theres
a
sour
scent
thats
just
faintly
under
the
nose
like
prunes
maybe
taste
is
light
peppery
and
fruity
the
fruit
is
sweet
but
theres
a
tartness
to
it
it
has
a
mouth
watering
quality
amidst
the
dry
yeast
it
has
soft
sweet
malty
bread
in
ti
but
its
melt
in
your
mouth
light
its
one
of
the
sweeter
dubbels
i
have
had
floral
and
brown
sugar
end
this
one
with
a
light
little
ticklish
bit
of
bitterness
to
linger
alongside
that
dry
malt
and
that
plum
o
happy
to
try
this
but
i
prefer
the
othr
beers
ive
had
from
wererbacher
o
the
yeasty
twang
midpalate
is
definitely
a
little
distracting
aside
from
that
its
a
solid
brew
that
supports
a
great
cause
overall
a
very
nice
dubbel
that
is
stylistically
not
out
of
place
its
a
little
watery
and
spicy
for
my
preference
but
it
certainly
represents
well
among
north
american
dubbels
at
first
the
plum
flavors
in
this
beer
completely
overwhelm
and
not
in
a
good
way
however
subsequent
sips
allow
for
the
greatness
in
this
beer
to
come
out
this
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
with
just
the
right
amount
of
fruit
to
go
along
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
surprisingly
it
pairs
very
well
with
a
meaty
lasagna

have

still
i
rather
enjoyed
it
but
these
issues
kept
it
from
being
top
flight
for
me
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
somewhat
enjoyable
but
only
after
it
warmed
up
and
the
aromas
and
flavors
of
plums
began
to
develop
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
perceptible
on
the
whole
a
respectable
dubbel
that
falls
just
short
of
being
excellent
a
little
too
syrupy
not
quite
dry
and
spicy
enough
in
the

and
the
omnipresent

is
a

jarring
still
a
solid
take
on

4
0
d
tasty
beer
that
i
recommend
picking
up
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
a
little
too
sweet
feeling
with
not
enough
malt
character
if
that
makes
any
sense
it
feels
too
much
like
candy
and
lacks
depth
the
spice
and
seemingly
a
melange
of
fruity
esters
just
isnt
enough
to
combat
the
sweetness
worth
trying
but
i
would
peobably
not
revist
overall
not
overly
blown
away
but
this
is
the
first
plum
based
beer
that
works
pity
its
8
dollars
a
bomber
or
i
would
get
another
nothing
really
special
but
i
can
get
down
with
this
what
with
all
of
the
bornems
and
ommegang
abbeys
i
still
approve
of
this
effort
overall
a
decent
dubbel
with
a
decent
fruitiness
rather
pleasant
drinking
and
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
a
dark
hazy
brew
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
a
little
malt
and
fruit
some
bubblegum
and
plenty
of
phenolic
scents
the
taste
is
where
the
fruit
rally
comes
out
plum
is
note
dont
eh
bottle
and
i
get
the
flavor
especially
as
i
work
through
the
beer
the
beer
is
semi
sweet
with
less
malt
flavor
than
the
smell
projected
lots
of
complexity
though
hop

not
enough
to
keep
from
downing
this
in
one
session
there
was
a
hint
of
raspberry
tartness
that
was
reflected
in
the
taste
and
syrupy
aspect
of
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
enough
to
help
overcome
the
shortness
of
this
this
would
be
a
great
introduction
to
this
style
for
a
neophyte
but
those
accustomed
to
heavier
examples
of
this
style
will
be
disappointed
to
a
small
extent
worth
a
go
once
to
enjoy
a
dubbel
that
feels
more
like
a
singel
overall
not
a
bad
dubbel
at
all
so
many
attempts
by
american
breweries
to
create
a
trappist
style
ale
end
up
as
failures
but
this
one
is
a
worthy
example
of
the
style
at
the
same
time
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
the
mood
for
a
dubbel
there
are
many
better
options
available
to
me
it
just
doesnt
do
enough
to
distinguish
itself
and
i
doubt
i
will
ever
get
althea
again

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
slightly
better
aroma
in
my
opinion
odecent
beer
but
just
misses
slightly
for
me
in
the
flavor
dept
o
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
it
has
its
merits
o
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
pretty
good
american
dubbel
with
some
of
the
proceeds
going
to
a
good
cause
this
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
poured
from
22oz
bottle
into
a

glass

a
good
deal
of

with
about
half
an
inch
of
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
bit
smells
good
with
malts
and
candy
sugars
and
a
nice

pours
a

with
minimal
light
penetration
tastes
very
sweet
even
for
a
double
notes
of
raspberry
and
bubble
gum
tastes
a
lot
like
a
weaker
quad
from
them
all
in
all
not
bad
not
great
but
definitely
for
a
good
cause
personally
it
lost
some
points
because
i
definitely
got
no
plum
notes
overall
a
very
tasty
belgian
dubbel
that
everyone
should
give
a
try
easy
to
consume
and
refreshing
from
a
maltforward
perspective
bottom

enjoyable
brew
from
th
easton
boys
o
good
beer
i
like
the
aromas
and
flavors
that
are
presents
overall
they
are
just
a
little
muted
though
definitely
worth
a
try

at
a
fairly
good

4
allagash
knows
what
theyre
doing
but
we
all
know
that
i
havent
had
the
dubbel
because
i
feel
itll
be
close
to
their
tripel
which
is
a
good
beer
but
doesnt
blow
me
awaybut
the
dubbel
reserve
is
cut
from
a
different
cloth
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
and
smells
of
fruit
and
sugar
it
tastes
of
fruit
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
with
a
little
bit
of
an
edge
to
it
that
makes
it
unique
it
says
its
aged
in
a
cellar
and
i
wouldnt
mind
taking
a
trip
to
that
cellar
to
thank
it
for
its
great
work

o
a
decent
beer
not
my
first
choice
of
belgian
styles
or
even
dubbels
certainly
not
the
worst
ive
had
either
new
to
belgian
dubbel
tasty
but
probably
not
a
regular
buy
best
thing
here
was
appearance
which
was
a
huge
rocky
creamcolored
long
lasting
head
some
lace
and
a
clear
buckwheat
honey
amber
color
aroma
is
mainly
yeast
some
malt
fruit
spice
flavors
similar
to
nose
somewhat
bittersweet
along
with
some
carbonic
tang
and
a
little
metallic
the
metallic
affects
the
body
leaving
high
points
that
dont
fit
maybe
this
beer
gets
a
lot
better
with
age
as
the
label
suggests
o
nothing
off
or
offensive
about
it
but
it
lacks
the
captivating
complexity
that
i
crave
of
the
style
perhaps
the
bar
is
set
pretty
high
in
my
mind
as
chimay
rouge
is
an
alltime
favorite
of
mine
delicious
beer
definitely
one
i
would
get
again
look
is
appealing
a
cloudy
amber
brown
color
aroma
has
hints
of
oak
taste
lacks
the
sweetsugary
fruitiness
of
other
dubbels
which
is
unexpected
not
sure
i
can
get
through
more
than
a
glass
mouthfeel
is
better
light
and
bubbly
with
the
expected
carbonation
but
i
still
cant
get
past
the
taste
perhaps
im
too
accustom
to
other
dubbels
but
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
does
not
have
that
lovely
mouthfeel
you
get
from
most
dubbels
very
light
mouthfeel
for
a
dubbel
much
more
carbonation
than
usual
very
powerful
spices
notes
almost
a
tobacco
flavor
no
real
dark
fruitcandy
syrup
flavor
apparent
due
to
heavy
spice
notes
overall
very
disappointing
flavor
is
bready
sweet
and
warm
some
dried
fruits
and
nut
on
the
palate
overall
a
mild
and
pleasant
representation
of
the
style
great
beer
must
try
got
this
at
local
bevmo
on
sale
o
tasty
well
put
together
let
it
warm
for
a
bit
to
get
to
temp
seems
to
help
it
open
it
up
some
decent
dark
copper
color
nice
khaki
head
and
thick
lace
faint
metallic
smell
mild
fruity
taste
medium
body
a
mediocre
dubbel
at
best
obviously
different
people
have
different
receptors
in
their
taste
buds
i
will
finish
drinking
this
but
i
cant
say
that
im
enjoying
it
an
outstanding
american
representative
of
the
belgian
style
faithful
but
memorable
in
its
own
right
this
one
stands
up
alongside
ommegangs
offerings
as
the
best
of
us
breweries
attempting
this
form
overall
this
is
a
solid
dubbed
a
belgian
style
that
i
love
i
have
thus
far
enjoyed
all
of
allagashs
products
and
this
one
is
no
different
good
beer
overall
3
38
eh
its
okay
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
unless
there
was
nothing
else
available
its
an
impressive
ale
but
nothing
world
class
and
nothing
especially
outstanding
very
simple
but
has
a
few
too
many
metallic
notes
going
on
in
the
flavor
profile
o
solid
flavors
but
most
importantly
wellbalanced
overall
very
good
american
dubbel
i
miss
a
strong
belgian
yeast
presence
which
holds
this
one
back
a
little
bleh
enough
said
overall
really
tasty
belgianstyle
ale
tons
of
flavor
nice
sturdiness
somewhat
winelike
in
its
complexity
allagash
can
do
no
wrong
i
just
dont
like
this
beer
every
bottle
ive
had
tastes
like
rubber
tires
and
disappointment
the
drafts
havent
been
much
better
i
love
allagash
but
this
beer
makes
me
sad
other
reviewers
says
it
cellars
well
creamy
smooth
medium
body
with
above
average
fine
soft
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
really
good
american
version
of
a
belgian
dubbel
malty
earthy
bready
fruity
funky
slightly
sweet
delicious
overall
this
is
an
ok
brew
the
only
weakness
this
provides
is
the
boring
carbonation
it
isnt
as
lively
as
i
would
have
liked
but
it
comes
together
nicely
this
is
worthy
malty
chocolate
flavor
with
a
nice
dry
finish
overall
not
my
favorite
from
allagash
but
it
is
a
decent
american
attempt
that
deserves
a
look
from
us
i
really
think
that
allagash
does
a
good
job
at
not
only
representing
this
type
but
capturing
the
whole
spectrum
of
belgian
ales
an
above
average
ale
no
shame
in
serving
this
or
ordering
i
will
go
back
again
a
very
nice
break
from
the
dozen
or
so
ipas
you
will
run
across
tonight
o
nice
dubbel
like
most
things
ive
tried
from
allegany
very
well
done
o
not
many
american
brewers
makes
a
great
dubbel
but
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
from
the
states
o
ok
beer
coriander
kills
it
for
me
but
if
you
like
coriander
give
this
a
try
a
decent
dubbel
will
have
again
well
worth
looking
for
lightly
hazy
brownish
amber
color
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
brown
sugar
clove
and
pepper
yeasty
esters
dominate
the
aroma
hints
of
dark
dried
fruits
round
out
the
nose
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
quite
well
medium
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
lightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
nice
light
easy
drinking
dubbel
pours
a
deep
cloudy
amber
with
a
nice
rich
head
inviting
smells
like
sweet
caramel
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
to
bite
the
nose
tastes
rich
with
sweet
biscuity
malts
clove
and
a
little
lemon
bite
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
resinous
on
the
tongue
overall
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
buy
again
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
dubbel
o
i
measure
most
belgian
beers
against
breweries
such
as
ommegang
and
chimay
and
this
surpassed
both
of
their
dubbels
in
my
book
complex
layered
dry
and
balanced
great
dubbel
ooverall
this
is
a
great
brew
away
to
go
allagash
this
dubbel
is
a
little
heavier
in
the
roasted
barley
malt
than
most
the
fruitiness
is
definite
but
lacks
the
flavor
complexity
of
the
greats
such
as
westmalle
a
super
easy
to
drink
dubbel
with
plenty
of
good
stuff
going
on
well
done
wish
i
could
get
allagash
easier
here
in
mn
would
be
drinking
the
hell
out
of
there
beersespecially
the
white
o
a
decent
dubbel
though
far
from
my
favorite
the
yeast
character
comes
off
similar
to
chimay
red
but
something
about
the
finish
seems
muddled
with
the
combination
of
dry
roast
and
sour
flavors
one
of
the
better
american
version
but
not
as
good
as
any
of
the
true
trappists
o
excellent
beer
i
picked
it
up
as
part
of
a
mixsix
so
not
sure
how
the
pricing
follows
ill
be
looking
into
it
again
my
sense
is
that
its
probably
going
to
cost
more
than
id
like
to
pay
on
a
regular
basis
but
hopefully
im
wrong
overall
was
really
pleasantly
surprised
i
excpected
a
strong
belgian
ale
where
i
got
something
that
had
the
flavor
profile
of
a
belgian
ale
but
was
much
smoother
and
more
drinkable
then
i
would
have
guessed
would
buy
sooner
then
i
would
other
strong
belgian
beers
overall
an
excellent
dubbel
different
than
belgian
brewed
and
with
more
a
strong
clove
spicy
character
overall
can
always
count
on
allagash
for
a
solid
brew
i
could
have
used
a
strong
malt
body
with
maybe
some
more
darker
fruit
accents
overall
very
good
though
overall
a
nice
brew
to
satisfy
the
mood
for
a
belgium
beer
and
an
ok
value
when
purchased
on
sale
now
this
is
a
damned
fine
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
into
the
official
kronenbourg
beer
reviewing
glass
tight
bubbles
more
resembling
foam
like
guiness
incredibly
smooth
mouthfeel
is
amazing
carbonation
is
perfect
some
fruit
light
oak
touch
of
smoke
great
balance
rich
yet
subtle
aroma
has
a
slight
wine
touch
to
it
and
a
little
wiff
of
alcohol
again
the
balance
covers
this
nicely
smoooth
the
alabash
brewers
are
the
master
craftsmen
this
would
make
a
nice
pairing
with
a
big
juicy
steak
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
excellent
feel
and
balanced
in
taste
i
am
no
dubbel
guru
but
i
would
recommend
trying
one
allagash
has
a
nice
dubbel
here
but
its
notably
lacking
in
pop
with
ommegang
also
readily
available
in
4packs
this
is
kind
of
a
hard
sell
overall
a
nice
beer
im
not
sure
if
im
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
again
but
if
it
pops
up
on
a
menu
somewhere
i
will
not
be
reluctant
to
order
it
up
cheers
very
light
for
a
dubbel
in
both
color
and
flavor
and
even
alcohol
it
pours
a
pale
muted
reddish
rust
color
with
a
prominent
cream
colored
head
of
big
bubbles
belgian
yeast
is
obvious
on
looks
alone
the
nose
agrees
dark
fruity
notes
from
the
malt
and
a
slight
spice
complimented
by
robust
belgian
yeast
that
has
fermented
basically
all
sugar
here
this
isnt
sweet
like
so
many
dubbels
its
almost
dry
subtly
flavored
and
then
disappearing
on
the
tongue
figs
and
honey
are
noticeable
in
the
flavor
as
is
rich
red
malt
it
finishes
especially
clean
for
the
style
owing
in
part
to
its
high
level
of
carbonation
only
medium
bodied
at
most
this
is
more
drinkable
than
many
versions
of
the
style
but
it
lacks
the
depth
that
makes
the
style
great
in
my
opinion
a
good
beer
especially
in
the
fall
but
allagash
has
proven
itself
to
be
capable
of
far
better
things
which
is
more
of
a
compliment
to
their
operation
than
a
knock
on
this
particular
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
my
first
allagash
review
but
definitely
not
my
first
allagash
beer
quality
stuff
but
theres
better
out
there
if
good
dont
mind
burning
ten
bucks
for
a
22
oz
bomber
give
it
a
go
salud
overall
i
have
had
this
before
but
i
think
the
bottle
aging
for
a
few
years
made
it
better
i
should
held
onto
it
for
a
few
more
oh
well
still
an
awesome
beer
overall
not
much
to
say
it
is
what
it
is
why
go
dubbel
when
you
can
go
tripel
still
a
solid
allagash
offering
o
this
is
a
reasonably
complex
dubbel
very
good
for
the
price
point
its
lighter
than
its
trappist
cousins
but
its
not
missing
anything
in
the
flavor
profile
poured
ontap
at
the
brewery
tasting
room
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
caramelbrown
coloring
with
a
thin
white
filmy
surface
coating
of
head
heart
aromas
of
nut
and
toffee
with
hints
of
booze
and
smoke
flavors
of
roast
and
smoke
initially
with
a
nutty
sweetness
forming
a
solid
backbone
subtle
tangy
sweetness
at
the
end
of
the
palate
and
into
the
aftertaste
smoke
rejoins
the
toffee
and
nut
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
blending
into
a
smooth
light
finish
despite
the
robust
palate
and
body
throughout
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
damn
tasty
o
pretty
good
but
not
the
best
i
like
ommegang
much
better
good
one
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
i
poured
this
yukky
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
cloudy
amber
in
color
and
poured
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
the
smell
was
nice
whispering
notes
of
creamy
caramel
and
nutty
goodness
that
makes
you
just
want
to
bite
it
then
you
drink
it
and
the
dream
is
over
sour
yuk
sour
beer
abbey
sourness
i
cant
stand
i
will
not
buy
again
browk
with
cherry
hues
some
central
foam
smells
of
traditional

medium
bodied
with
thigh
higher

forward
carb
with
a
semi
dry
fnish
id
drink
aggain
but
im
not
likely
to
order
again
in
a
pub
o
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
but
not
bad
either
flawless
smooth
and
quaffable
overall
not
too
impressed
with
this
glad
i
tried
it
but
was
hoping
for
a
better
offering
from
allagash
the
smell
and
taste
were
lacking
maybe
they
were
trying
to
understate
these
two
components
but
it
didnt
keep
my
interest
will
move
on
to
try
their
tripel
and
quad
soon
cheers
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
certainly
not
in
the
elite
of
dubbels
i
wont
avoid
it
in
the
future
but
i
do
prefer
allagashs
tripel
o
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
ever
had
if
not
the
best
o
the
flavor
profile
is
excellent
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
i
would
have
appreciated
a
little
more
thickness
good
representation
of
the
style
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
again

finish
body
is
medium
while
being
nice
and
creamy
overall
ive
had
better
from
allagash
but
this
was
decent
o
really
hard
to
complain
about
this
one
this
hits
a
nice
balance
between
being
clean
and
being
complex
an
excellent
example
of
a
subtle
beer
o
this
really
is
a
great
dubbel
i
find
that
many
in
the
style
are
over
the
top
malty
and
way
too
sweet
for
my
liking
im
struck
the
incredible
balance
found
here
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
see
on
the
shelf
all
of
the
time
and
just
pass
over
very
happy
that
somebody
gave
this
to
me
for
a
christmas
gift
otherwise
i
would
have
probably
continued
to
ignore
this
fine
beer
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
nuttiness
through
the
flavoring
it
really
added
seriousness
to
the
finish
contrasting
with
the
sourness
of
grain
and
bittering
phenolic
plastics
this
made
for
a
clean
and
clear
finish
to
the
sip
otherwise
the
aroma
and
flavoring
were
a
bit
subdued
and
not
quite
as
robust
as
we
would
have
like
for
the
style
or
the
brewery
overall
this
was
a
delicious
brew
with
a
clean
balanced
finish
i
didnt
expect
anything
less
from
allagash
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
a
solid
domestic
dubbel
wonderful
balance
but
lacks
a
bit
of
punch
still
very
enjoyable
this
brew
poured
with
almost
no
head
except
for
a
hint
of
white
capping
the
dark
orange
cloudy
body
mild
carbonation
was
visible
on
the
brew
the
nose
had
hints
of
spices
and
dark
fruit
a
bit
of
the
typical
belgian
smells
but
pretty
subdued
the
taste
was
definite
dark
fruits
with
some
booze
i
also
got
some
spice
and
breadiness
to
it
the
other
odd
thing
i
got
was
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
comes
out
towards
the
end
the
metallic
taste
really
lingers
with
the
finish
this
brew
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
wouldnt
rush
back
to
have
it
again
o
fine
stuff
i
havent
had
many
beers
of
this
style
but
it
seems
to
be
a
consistent
middleofthepack
example
the
rest
medium
bodied
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
standup
dubbel
o
i
would
definitley
drink
this
and
recommend
it
to
freinds
and
family
i
would
not
seek
out
this
beer
in
stores
though
a
bit
sweet
for
me
i
like
it
because
of
the
malt
profile
and
the
belgian
yeast
spice
but
again
the
sweetness
did
not
do
it
for
me
i
would
give
this
a
solid
b
overall
drinkability
i
wonder
if
this
one
was
past
due
i
cant
tell
since
the
batch
and
date
code
are
meaningless
to
me
its
not
really
wowing
me
but
its
not
bad
a
bit
weak
in
the
aroma
dept
and
the
blend
of
tastes
isnt
quite
doing
it
for
me
but
its
interesting
enough
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
dubbel
worth
picking
up
ogood
beer
with
a
depth
of
flavor
you
have
to
think
about
this
one
its
not
all
in
the
taste
there
are
layers
that
came
out
past
the
one
year
mark
seeing
as
i
have
had
one
fresh
from
the
brewery
this
is
a
delicious
beer
the
flavor
is
complex
yet
drinkable
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
overall
i
have
not
had
many
dubbels
but
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
need
to
try
more
of
this
style
utah
does
not
carry
allagash
so
i
will
try
others
but
will
certainly
have
this
again
when
i
have
a
chance
o
impressive
brew
nice
complexity
robust
flavor
very
true
to
the
style
o
was
worried
about
this
sitting
at
room
temp
for
so
long
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
id
choose
chimay
red
over
this
but
it
was
cool
to
get
allagash
in
texas
right
now
especially
a
style
that
should
hold
up
for
a
few
years
overall
this
one
is
a
little
too
thin
for
me
and
what
i
expect
from
the
genre
with
the
taste
seemly
held
back
i
have
had
better
dubbels
this
isnt
quite
up
to
par
with
the
other
allagash
brews
i
have
had
overall
i
guess
this
is
an
old
bottle
since
it
has
a
dark
layer
of
sediment
at
the
base
that
and
i
got
little
banana
flavor
but
old
it
seems
to
be
a
well
crafted
dubbel
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
it
shines
a
brilliant
garnet
red
in
the
glass
as
it
sports
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
which
laces
nicely
bananas
and
cloves
tickle
the
nose
as
a
rich
brown
sugar
scent
satisfies
the
taste
remarkable
the
spice
hits
the
tongue
immediately
followed
by
a
rush
of
light
sweetness
its
subtly
estery
belgian
yeast
is
at
the
forefront
that
is
for
sure
it
has
a
very
rich
malty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
herbal
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
creamy
and
all
too
spectacular
try
this
beer
tasty
blended
well
quite
good
o
deffinitely
had
much
better
dubbels
and
definitely
had
much
better
from
allagash
as
a
brewer
of
a
lot
of
belgian
styles
this
style
isnt
there
strong
suit
doesnt
deter
my
opinion
of
them
o
a
spot
on
tasty
american
dubbel
bravo
to
allagash
overall
the
flavor
profile
is
what
a
dubbel
should
be
although
it
doesnt
add
much
too
the
style
its
great
to
see
a
belgian
like
this
brewed
in
america
its
growing
on
me
but
i
just
wish
it
was
less
carbonated
its
a
twodimensional
beer
o
this
is
a
style
i
am
still
getting
acquainted
with
but
i
quite
enjoyed
this
offering

to
the
aftertaste
somewhat
more
spiced
and
more
reminiscent
of
a

in
some
respects
a
different
take
on
the
dubbel
that
works
well
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
34111018
sampled
on
leap
day
feb

2012
the
pour
is
a
slightly
cloudy
medium
amber
with
a
generous
fluffy
tan
head
it
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
alive
with
sweet
malts
yeast
coriander
and
other
spices
with
a
slight
hop
coating
the
body
is
medium
the
flavor
is
of
candied
malts
and
pepper
it
ends
fairly
dry
i
liked
it
good
beer
worth
a
try
overall
d
i
cannot
finish
the
12
oz
bottle
o
really
good
beer
a
good
start
for
my
first
allagash
b
its
easy
to
drink
but
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
o
a
bit
too
much
yeast
for
me
probably
wont
revisit
overall
the
look
was
perfect
smell
was
good
but
the
taste
i
just
couldnt
get
into
too
much
carbonation
too
light
on
flavors
and
has
a
very
off
putting
metallic
taste
i
have
had
this
beer
before
and
it
did
not
taste
like
this
hoping
its
just
a
bad
batch
im
still
trying
to
get
used
to
and
get
to
know
more
about
belgian
beers
i
have
had
quite
a
few
dubbels
before
this
is
tasty
and
reminds
me
of
the
ones
i
have
had
this
gets
more
complex
and
tasty
as
it
sits
the
smooth
carbonation
and
complex
character
of
the
taste
give
this
beer
a
high
mark
in
all
the
right
places
the
color
may
be
a
bit
dark
for
a
true
dubbel
but
the
malty
highlights
make
this
beer
a
winner
mouhtfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
textured
with
a
nice
creamy
finish
overall
allagash
dubbel
is
nice
affordable
american
made
dubbel
making
it
great
for
budget
conscious
beer
geeks
o
tasty
easy
drinker
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
would
definitely
have
this
again
the
taste
is
a
little
light
while
still
acheiving
a
complexity
the
malt
is
strong
and
acquired
a
spice
from
the
belgian
yeast
it
tastes
sweet
up
front
but
finishes
dry
not
my
favorite
from
allagash
but
thats
an
easily
quaffable
beer
a
very
good
dubbel
would
recommend
pretty
tasty
not
too
sweet
and
wellbalanced
worth
trying
at
least
once
oanother
very
enjoyable
offering
from
what
has
become
a
favorite
brewery
of
mine
every
beer
they
make
is
deeply
complex
and
rich
with
flavor
leaves
a
bit
of
warmth
as
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
an
ample
hopping
finish
it
off
overall
quite
impressive
brew
not
a
world
class
example
of
the
dubbel
style
though
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
nothing
outrageous
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
dubbel
maybe
a
touch
light
on
some
malt
sweetness
but
very
clean
flavors
i
still
dont
have
a
good
handle
on
this
style
of
beer
and
always
feel
hesitant
in
stating
if
what
ive
just
had
is
good
for
the
style
bad
for
the
style
or
simply
middle
of
the
road
i
know
that
i
liked
this
beer
though
im
not
heartbroken
that
it
may
be
the
last
time
i
have
it
in
a
while
due
to
its
unavailability
in
northeast
ohio
i
believe
that
theres
plenty
to
recommend
about
this
beer
nice
tasting
beautiful
in
appearance
and
it
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
i
also
am
not
finding
it
to
be
terribly
memorable
as
i
type
up
this
review
and
it
sits
in
the
glass
awaiting
further
consumption
i
guess
the
best
i
can
say
is
try
it
you
can
find
it
but
dont
stress
if
you
cant
find
it
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
fruity
with
notes
of
caramel
in
the
taste
fruity
and
a
small
tartness
and
dry
yeastiness
a
sour
like
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
to
tart
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
nice
sour
presence
that
came
with
age
and
a
nice
fruitiness
flavor
crisp
malt
with
small
influxes
of
apple
and
cigar
smoke
moving
through
the
incredibly
dry
texture
it
is
so
airy
that
sometimes
it
doesnt
even
taste
like
i
am
drinking
anything
the
small
flavors
coming
in
and
out
coincide
with
a
flavor
that
i
can
only
describe
as
a
plainness
that
i
am
guessing
has
arisen
due
to
it
being
in
the
fridge
and
not
a
cellar
for
a
long
while
this
allagash
would
go
well
with
a
steak
or
a
beef
stew
game
meat
pork
curriedspicey
foods
overall
i
found
it
to
be
a
rather
underwhelming
beer
the
dubbel
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
standards
that
allagash
has
set
and
reset
with
nearly
every
other
beer
they
produce
while
i
wont
shy
away
from
it
in
the
future
i
certainly
wont
be
seeking
it
out
ever
again
this
highly
drinkable
dubbel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
effervescence
it
becomes
slight
oily
and
slick
as
it
warms
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
o
the
bitterness
is
offset
by
the
wonderfully
light
mouthfeel
and
aroma
nice
beer
but
not

for

overall
this
is
definitely
an
excellent
dubbel
from
allagash
very
balanced
and
drinkable
i
plan
to
purchase
a
few
more
bottles
and
cellar
a
few
to
see
if
this
dubbel
changes
character
for
the
better
over
a
period
of
time
this
poured
out
as
a
typical
shade
of
brown
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
earthy
it
also
had
some
dark
fruits
and
yeast
aromas
in
there
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
some
nice
sweet
flavors
upfront
that
faded
into
a
dry
soft
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
and
very
smooth
overall
its
a
pretty
good
dubbel
i
think
i
wasnt
disappointed
by
it
at
all
pours
a
nice
slightly
hazy
tea
color
with
a
bubbly
off
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
is
a
little
musty
a
little
belgium
funk
with
some
sugar
and
grape
the
taste
is
pretty
great
this
might
be
aged
but
i
get
some
caramel
malts
some
grape
all
very
dry
on
the
way
down
along
with
some
almost
roasted
malt
hop
bitterness
this
beer
taste
wise
is
fantastic
feel
is
very
carbonated
with
a
medium
thickness
it
has
some
wateryness
to
it
made
well
possibly
stored
poorly
and
for
too
long
perhaps
a
touch
sweeter
than
classic
trappist
dubbels
but
allagash
dubbel
tilts
toward
the
maltier
side
of
the
scale
for
a
succulent
session
that
rivals
some
of
the
best
made
belgian
strong
dark
ales
this
beer
has
proven
to
cellar
with
grace
and
confidence
at
least
through
three
years
of
conditioning
opens

a
large
pop

large

and
a

appleskin
white

light
fig
and
some
faint
spice
it
could
be
the
peppery
belgian
yeast
or
it
could
be
muddled
coriander
but
there
is
a
small
spice
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
musty
yeast
grapes
and
malty
all
the
while
with
faint
caramel
there
is
a
subtle
growing
dryness
to
this
beer
and
time
has
evened
out
all
the
flavors
and
made
for
a
smooth
feel
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
light
at
that
overall
the
allagash
dubbel
holds
up
nicely
with
5
years
on
it
a
nice
treat
pretty
smooth
not
as
strong
as
i
thought
a
good
dubbel
nonetheless
overall
a
very
solid
dublle
especially
an
americanmade
one
if
i
come
across
this
brew
again
i
will
definitely
be
getting
more
of
it
overall
experience
a
nice
beer
fit
to
style
just
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
nothing
but
great
brews
from
allagash
d
overall
an
exceptionally
smooth
beer
that
i
can
thoroughly
enjoy
o
not
great
not
much
like
a
dubbel
3
do
yum
big
thanks
to
taturbo
for
this
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
sampled
today
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
but
i
dont
know
if
its
possible
to
be
better
than
this
wow
overall
a
really
good
dubbel
not
as
much
spice
as
others
ive
had
pretty
straightforward
but
solid
nonetheless
o
lets
face
it
this
is
one
tough
category
competition
includes
the
authentic
belgians
themselves
and
thus
even
an
average
score
is
an
achievement
overalleven
as
this
beer
warms
up
and
the
spices
and
malts
have
a
chance
to
shine
the
yeast
just
doesnt
allow
it
combined
with
the
hop
finish
which
is
nice
i
picked
up
a
lasting
note
ofthis
is
going
to
sound
nutsasparagus
this
is
an
interesting
offering
though
not
as
drinkable
and
balanced
as
i
usually
find
in
a
dubbel
o
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
id
buy
it
again
the
7
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
i
think
some
gouda
cheese
apples
and
a
hunk
of
bread
would
suit
this
beer
overall
pretty
good
good
for
a
different
take
on
the
classic
dubbel
style
not
as
much
flavor
as
higher
rated
dubbels
but
that
does
seem
to
give
it
better
drinkability
ommegang
abbey
is
better
but
id
probably
just
pick
whatever
is
available
in
4
packs
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
nice
representation
of
the
style
o
a
solid
dubbel
fits
to
style
very
well
pour
is
perfect
dark
brown
with
an
incredible
head
of
tan
that
just
comes
up
and
over
the
top
superbly
an
leaves
tons
of
lacing
and
coating
in
its
wake
aroma
of
dark
belgian
yeast
hints
of
brown
sugar
earthy
an
evil
dark
grains
and
hints
at
light
grasses
and
interesting
notes
of
malts
flavor
smooth
creamy
like
velvet
as
it
caresses
the
tongue
and
really
just
puts
on
an
amazing
show
of
flavor
creamy
and
subtle
finish
is
smooth
sugary
and
long
lasting
as
the
last
drop
is
just
as
good
as
the
first
o
i
am
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
it
starts
off
strong
but
just
doesnt
back
up
the
initial
punch
of
flavor
has
some
characteristics
of
a
good
belgian
but
it
doesnt
come
together
for
me
not
my
favorite
in
style
has
some
stout
characteristics
id
perfect
a
little
sweeter
or
spicier
in
a
beer
of
this
style
d
a
lot
going
on
not
that
familiar
with
style
but
very
good
nonetheless
allagash
does
belgians
extremely
well
o
very
nice
belgian
here
getting
the
reserve
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
was
expecting
something
really
off
the
charts
perhaps
not
worth
the
price
i
would
certainly
get
this
again
in
the
regular
likely
cheaper
variety
ill
still
enjoy
finishing
this
bottle
d
impressive
offering
of
a
belgian
style
from
a
domestic
microbrewery
allagash
has
a
winner
overall
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
the
750ml
though
i
will
probably
opt
to
try
a
few
other
dubbels
before
i
return
to
this
one
pours
a
dark
amber
copper
color
a
small
white
head
forms
but
doesnt
last
very
long
leaves
a
nice
ring
of
lacing
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
smells
of
toffee
caramel
fresh
bread
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
notes
of
sweet
caramel
bread
and
bananas
the
mouthful
was
average
with
decent
carbonation
present
overall
this
beer
didnt
do
it
for
me
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
but
there
are
much
better
dubbels
out
there
allagash
dubbel
is
much
differant
than
the
dubbel
beer
i
have
tasted
it
has
a
bolder
complex
taste
yet
balanced
and
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
pours
cloudy
amber
in
color
with
a
fair
head
and
lace
spice
and
hint
of
herbs
with
a
slightly
sweet
smell
malty
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
coffee
overall
very
glad
i
finally
got
over
the
pretense
and
grabbed
a
bottle
cant
wait
to
find
this
in
a
bar
pours
a
murky
brown
with
some
red
highlights
moderate
cap
of
khaki
head
little
retention
and
spotty
lacing
scent
is
dominated
by
the
bready
malts
lightly
toasted
moderate
yeastyness
candi
sugar
and
dark
fruits
on
the
back
taste
is
fairly
malt
forward
crusty
wheat
bread
lightly
toasted
grians
candi
and
brown
sugar
combine
with
some
fruit
notes
yeast
profile
lower
than
many
other
belgians
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonations
minimal
lingering
sweetness
a
nice
beer
quite
malty
yet
not
as
sweet
overall
a
decent
dubbel
even
though
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
it
was
really
drinkable
and
my
bottle
didnt
last
long
i
will
probably
end
up
grabbing
my
second
pretty
soon
here
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
good
dubbel
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
the
bitter
spike
does
enough
to
keep
this
one
on
the
edge
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
especially
on
a
cold
night
poured
into
my
snifter
and
i
am
met
with
a
darker
amber
colored
ale
and
big
frothy
massive
cream
colored
head
with
major
staying
power
throughout
the
session
nice
fruity
smells
with
a
malt
whiff
undertones
pear
and
red
apples
are
present
interesting
taste
there
is
an
almost
grainy
type
of
taste
followed
by
a
leatherydark
chocolate
powder
at
the
back
of
the
throat
big
maltbiscuit
taste
on
the
swallow
some
coffee
taste
lingers
well
after
consumption
just
stepped
away
from
the
beer
and
came
back
for
a
sip
and
got
major
campfire
smoke
in
the
taste
and
then
a
huge
dose
of
malt
a
lot
going
on
here
much
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
though
still
getting
bubbles
in
the
chest
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
a
lot
happening
in
the
this
bottle
for
a
dubbel
well
worth
trying
out
for
yourself
and
seeing
what
this
is
all
about
at
7
a
750
is
rather
easy
to
consume
though
i
could
see
the
taste
getting
tiresome
pours
a
nice
mahogany
with
a
red
hue
shining
through
a
pearl
white
head
absorbs
some
of
the
red
color
laces
all
the
way
down
the
glass
real
nice
looking
aroma
of
pepper
spices
yeast
and
dark
fruits
smooth
and
malty
flavor
profile
starts
off
with
just
a
hint
of
belgian
spice
and
pepper
before
the
sweet
dark
fruit
malts
take
over
this
beer
had
nearly
2
years
of
age
on
it
and
it
really
smoothed
it
over
more
malt
on
the
finish
a
bit
of
candied
sugar
sweet
bread
and
caramel
nice
sticky
mouthfeel
poured
from
a
corkedcaged
750ml
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
dark
brown
with
amber
highlights
good
clingy
offwhite
head
not
much
in
the
nose
clunky
flavor
of
earth
and
some
spice
with
a
dry
finish
something
sterile
about
it
maybe
eucalyptus
no
trace
of
the
fruitiness
expected
in
a
dubbel
generally
didnt
live
up
to
its
pricetag
this
beer
is
quite
cloudy
brown
in
glass
sort
of
muddy
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
has
good
retention
to
me
the
smell
is
a
bit
weak
and
somewhat
dominated
by
belgian
yeast
character
with
a
bit
of
clove
and
horse
barn
esters
coming
through
beyond
that
there
is
a
bit
of
bready
malt
and
maybe
some
slight
fruit
the
taste
too
is
classic
belgian
dubbel
im
actually
quite
impressed
fruit
molasses
bready
grain
and
cloves
are
all
present
but
well
blended
the
finish
is
tingly
and
dry
as
a
result
of
the
fine
and
lively
carbonation
slightly
sweet
but
not
cloying
despite
having
little
hop
bitterness
to
balance
overall
quite
good
but
i
expected
that
having
always
been
impressed
by
beers
from
allagash
they
have
definitely
mastered
the
classic
belgian
styles
o
its
enjoyable
but
not
allagashs
best
offering
tasty
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
less
sweet
and
fruity
poured
a
medium
hazy
brown
with
a
large
off
white
frothy
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
but
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
nutty
malts
a
sweet
leathery
yeast
with
hints
of
burnt
coffee
molasses
and
a
mild
odor
of
dried
fruit
it
tasted
lightly
bitter
in
the
beginning
and
finished
with
a
maltybitter
flavor
with
notes
of
nuts
and
coffee
with
the
flavor
lasting
an
average
amount
of
time
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
creamy
in
texture
with
the
carbonation
being
quite
flat
overall
a
tasty
dubbel
but
just
an
average
brew
its
a
little
thin
but
still
overall
a
good
beer
not
the
best
dubbel
ever
but
still
enjoyable
i
am
a
bit
disappointing
with
this
as
i
just
had
it
on
tap
and
it
was
sublime
in
the
bottle
it
doesnt
taste
nearly
as
impressive
oh
well
id
get
it
on
tap
in
a
heartbeat
but
wont
be
buying
this
8
99
25
ouner
bottle
again
i
will
try
the
trippel
though
for
the
same
price
still
hard
to
not
buy
the
cheaper
and
better
la
fin
du
monde
for
a
newworld
belgian
ale
treat
mouthfeel
is
really
good
as
the
beer
is
weighted
well
and
offers
a
diverse
array
of
sensations
smooth
creamy
chalky
and
thin
the
chalky
feeling
in
particular
makes
me
feel
like
i
just
chewed
on
raw
leaves
and
makes
this
beer
oddly
similar
in
some
ways
to
chewing
paan
indian
postmeal
breathmint
type
food
the
betel
leaf
feeling
is
very
nice
drinkability
is
aided
greatly
by
the
clean
finish
all
flavors
are
killed
off
allowing
the
cycle
of
tastes
to
begin
anew
with
each
new
sip
mouthfeel
however
is
not
refreshed
each
time
which
means
the
chalkiness
can
build
up
over
time
leading
to
your
teeth
to
feel
like
they
have
been
chewing
on
each
other
the
whole
time
nonetheless
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
cpj
pours
an
opaque
dirty
looking
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
lacing
is
spotty
rings
down
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
like
dark
fruits
plums
cherries
and
pineapple
tastes
of
the
dark
fruit
sweet
malt
and
yeast
there
is
a
biting
bitterness
to
this
beer
that
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
carbonation
is
a
little
flat
on
this
beer
drinkability
is
a
little
above
average
due
to
the
bitterness
and
carbonation
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
from
allagash
but
i
wouldt
get
it
again
d
good
smooth
drink
another
quality
dubbel
from
allagash
i
would
certainly
have
another
d
decent
drinkability
somewhat
bitter
and
slightly
cloying
this
is
drinkable
but
only
barely
drinkability
a
decent
belgianstyle
dubbel
while
its
certainly
not
the
best
dubbel
out
there
it
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
it
really
lacks
some
of
that
uniquely
belgian
flavor
to
it
but
makes
up
for
it
in
expressive
hoppiness
and
a
crisp
feel
worth
a
shot
overall
pretty
good
dubbel
overall
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
for
considering
the
reputation
of
allagash
but
still
a
good
beer
nonetheless
86
d
not
enough
spice
for
me
but
if
you
like
a
sweeter
taste
this
one
might
be
up
your
alley
rating
confirmed
and
description
tweaked
with
tasting
on
62711
this
was
chosen
for
me
at
random
from
the
beer
menu
by
my
80sloving
companions
they
didnt
do
all
that
bad
frankly
it
pours
a
hazy
ambergarnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
raisins
brown
sugar
and
light
rye
bread
the
taste
holds
notes
of
brown
sugar
figs
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
wheat
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
an
almost
chewy
feel
overall
a
solid
dubbel
nothing
too
fancy
but
tasty
and
enjoyable
d
pretty
disappointing
but
i
have
to
say
im
not
entirely
surprised
ive
only
really
enjoyed
a
couple
of
allagash
beers
and
this
is
not
one
of
them
drinkability
im
not
sure
if
i
want
a
more
powerful
flavor
or
not
allagash
always
executes
well
even
if
i
dont
agree
with
their
intentions
poured
into
a
chalice
deep
amber
mahogany
body
with
a
finger
of

that
quickly
fades
leaving
only
a
lace
ring
at
the
top
a
nice
sweetness
to
the
nose
caramel
molasses
brown
sugar
as
well
as
some
darker
fruits
getting
alot
more
of
the
fruitiness
in
the
taste
but
still
fairly
sweet
even
some
chocolate
flavor
also
some
earthy
woody
notes
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
seemed
on
the
higher
side
of
average
carbonation
drinkabilityits
on
the
more
drinkable
side

is

a
smooth

my

is
dark

with
a
freshness
and
attractively
mild

finishes
nicely
and
tastes
quite
good
all
around
the
label
states
that
it
has
a
remarkably
clean
finish
and
that
is
certainly
true
this
dubbel
is
crisp
pleasant
and
very
refreshing
i
found
the
body
a
bit
thinner
than
i
expected
still
this
was
nice
and
smooth
going
down
and
the
alcohol
hardly
noticeable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
recommended
d
drinkability
is
high
easy
to
drink
and
good
flavor
besides
the
slight
hiccup
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
overall
a
good
tasting
belgian
just
were
a
bit
more
solid
throughout
d
compared
to
other
dubbels
this
beer
isnt
quite
as
easy
to
drink
because
of
the
amount
of
dryness
and
spiciness
the
becomes
a
bit
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
up
i
got
this
in
the
750
ml
bottle
sherry
looking
in
color
it
is
very
foamy
and
the
off
head
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
the
smell
is
that
dark
fruit
smell
with
a
bit
of
booziness
the
taste
is
okay
but
pretty
plain
with
just
the
alcohol
taste
coming
through
the
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
this
leaves
a
malty
aftertaste
that
hangs
around
for
a
long
time
very
drinkable
but
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
again
i
bought
it
because
i
think
the
odyssey
is
fantastic
the
dubbel
just
didnt
measure

d
this

is

is

tasty
and
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
with
a
dry

and
a
light
body
throughout
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
for
a
style
i
only
crave
once
in
a
while
drink
id
like
to
try
it
again
paired
with
the
right
cheese
or
chocolate
smells
primarily
of
bananas
and
clove
reminds
me
of
an
extract
homebrew
made
with
stale
extract
twangbanana
esters
although
the
bananas
are
a
nice
fruity
smell
i
still
am
reminded
of
poorly
constructed
homebrews
good
malts
with
a
nice
hop
finish
would
definitely
drink
again
but
not
my
top
beer
from
allagash
medium
carbing
med
body
drinks
fairly
easily
id
take
this
one
any
day
of
the
week
drinkability
is
meh
im
not
finding
this
nearly
as
good
as
other
allagash
offerings
and
wouldnt
have
this
one
again
body
has
some
viscosity
and
the
finish
leaves
a
touch
of
dried
fruit
on
the
tongue
most
of
the
character
is
in
the
final
moments
cheers
overall
a
very
tasty
dubbel
a
great
american
version
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
but
id
like
to
try
the
classic
dubbels
from
belgium
to
compare
jd
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
between
moderate
and
high
drinkability
is
decent
it
had
some
nice
flavors
and
spices
to
it
everything
came
together
pretty
well
and
was
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
great
character
and
easily
available
this
makes
for
a
fine
beer
to
drink
while
reading
or
with
food
still
a
very
solid
effort
from
allagash
and
probably
one
of
the
cheaper
and
more
readily
available
dubbels
on
the
market
d
this
is
one
that
i
will
pick
up
from
time
to
time
especially
in
the
fall
the
two
of
them
seem
to
go
together
its
pretty
drinkable
since
its
kinda
simple
in
taste
and
feel
in
fact
this
pretty
much
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
for
the
style
now
that
i
think
about
it
allagash
does
belgian
right
surprisingly
here
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
fairly
enjoyable
not
much
carbonation
just
to
finish
it
i
found
it
scarily
easy
to
take
this
in
big
gulps
i
dont
know
whats
going
on
here
but
id
be
willing
to
give
this
a
shot
on
tap
however
never
from
bottle
again
though
d
tasty
for
sure
and
a
reasonably
price
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
d
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
brew
it
is
not
the
most
complex
dubbel
out
there
but
it
is
a
pleasant
sipper
with
a
reasonable
price
tag
notesthis
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
got
this
because
it
was
my
favorite
when
i
did
the
tour
at
allagash
i
think
this
has
inspired
me
a
little
seek
out
more
dubbels
pairing
simple
mole
of
duck
and
eggplant
d
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
belgian
would
reccomend
it
to
any
casual
dark
beer
drinker
note
corrected
review
as
this
was
initially
put
on
their
dubbel
reserve750
category
d
this
one
had
a
flavor
smell
profile
that
i
hadnt
experienced
before
overall
it
was
a
little
strange
to
me
but
certainly
not
off
putting
i
liked
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
not
highly
drinkable
to
me
i
could
finish
a
bottle
or
two
worth
a
try
maybe
as
a
single
if
possible
very
nice
dubbel
from
allagash
d
this
one
is
drinkable
but
not
great
per
the
style
allagash
has
done
themselves
proud
with
this
one
this
can
stand
on
its
own
with
most
belgian
dubbels
paling
only
to
some
of
the
best
it
is
appropriate
to
the
style
in

way

this
dark

ale
is
a
good
quality
ale
but
not
the
best
interpretation
of
a

beglian
it
does
have
a
slight

goes
down
but
nothing

the

is
incredibly
clean
just
as
is
advertised
on

all
in

this
is
a

not
worthy
of
the

praise
that

drinking

drinkability
not
the
most
complex
dubbel
out
there
this
is
much
better
than
their
regular
double
and
is
among
the
better
american
examples
of
the
style
as
it
is
neither
cloying
nor
overly
alcoholladen
d
moderately
drinkable
but
i
think
id
feel
like
an
asshole
if
i
drank
more
than
a
couple
of
these
because
theyre
so
delicate
and
posh
i
think
allagashs
market
is
weird
like
that
i
never
feel
like
im
supposed
to
drink
more
than
2
of
anything
they
make
nevertheless
dubbels
are
a
new
style
for
me
and
they
intrigue
the
hell
out
of
me
d
overall
a
pretty
decent
dubbel
that
is
worth
a
try
it
was
200
on
a
weekend
so
i
decided
to
have
the
lowest
abv
selection
they
had
the
double
was
actually
very
good
refreshing
while
still
having
a
good
malt
character
not
too
raisonny
but
interesting
enough
to
be
enjoyable
and
light
it
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
and
it
finishes
up
dry

pretty

doubbel

demonstrates
its
significant
skill
again
with
this

taste
is
where
this
was
disappointing
didnt
have
the
strong
belgian
sugar
or
dark
fruits
there
was
a
mild
chocolate
and
heavy
malty
flavor
to
this
light
carbonation
and
strong
medium
body
makes
this
mouthfeel
very
nice
overall
impression
we
felt
this
beers
flavor
was
a
bit
weak
for
the
style
but
he
flavor
was
reasonably
complex
and
balanced
a
good
american
made
example
that
should
go
over
well
with
newbeez
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
but
the
review
must
be
at

225
characters
a
good
beer
any
day
overall
i
thought
the
nose
gained
a
bit
from
the
cask
pour
but
the
flavor
suffered
a
bit
still
a
solid
beer
and
well
worth
a
shot
d
i
could
have
a
couplefew
of
these
d
a
solid
real
intro
into
this
style
the
american
examples
of
tripels
i
have
really
liked
but
the
dubbels
still
have
some
work
to
do
certainly
one
of
the
better
priced
750s
out
there
so
its
got
that
going
for
it
which
is
nice
overall
a
less
than
average
dubbel
d
highly
drinkablecomplex
flavors
i
drank
this
following
a
rochefort
10
which
was
not
a
good
idea
because
it
made
this
brew
taste
like
h2o
affordable
at
8
bucks
for
a
four
banger
would
buy
again
and
again
this
is
one
of
my
top
styles
and
is
a
tasty
brew
i

that
this
brew

than
i
am

to
and
i
feel

the

jumps
out
a

d
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
still
a
highly
drinkable
offering
from
allagash
d
seemingly
good
at
first
this
beer
ended
up
being
pretty
average
in
my
opinion
doesnt
drink
bad
but
there
is
a
lack
of
character
that
puts
me
off
d
if
this
one
came
in
six
packs
for
less
than
ten
dollars
then
i
would
consider
it
a
worthy
session
brew
for
the
colder
months
for
me
thats
both
good
and
bad
in
that
the
brew
could
be
more
distinguished
and
have
more
character
with
a
firmer
taste
and
perhaps
more
variation
in
the
ingredients
used

good
wouldnt

abv
overall
a
drinkable
complex
dubbel
the
medicinal
flavor
can
wear
thin
at
times
but
it
doesnt
detract
much
from
this
beer
d
a
pretty
easydrinking
dubbel
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
lives
up
to
the
high
allagash
standards
it
has
an
incredibly
smooth
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
that
is
satisfying
like
a
bite
of
bread
it
is
very
drinkable
despite
the
strangely
bland
taste
and
aroma
batch
45
yet
another
drinkable
beer
from
allagash
surprise
the
color
is
unspectacular
and
the
head
lasts
but
a
brief
period
even
if
you
work
hard
to
generate
one
but
the
aroma
is
generous
full
of
cinnamon
and
cloves
oranges
apricots
and
other
assorted
fruity
things
with
enough
bread
to
give
it
some
depth
the
body
is
reasonably
dense
and
as
youd
expect
full
of
fruit
theres
a
good
deal
of
spicy
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
even
a
bit
of
mossiness
the
carbonation
is
mild
but
enough
to
give
some
bite
a
family
favorite
d
this
is
easy
drinking
for
the
style
not
cloyingly
sweet
but
also
not
as
complex
as
others
of
the
style
are
this
one
falls
somewhere
in
the
middle
d
certainly
the
type
of
beer
i
like
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
thats
more
personal
preference
than
anything
else
taste
nothing
is
really
standing
out
or
distinguishing
it

than
a
weird
brown
sugar

comes

your
mouth

hint
of
cocoa

retained
the
malty

it

ill
have
to

the

try
to
see
how
it
stacks
up
first
a
bit
of
roasted

which
flows
right
into
the
complex

character
which
is
actually
kind
of
standard
and
not
so
complex
towards
the

of

taste
is
a
subtle
kind
of
roasted
nuttiness
and
the
sweet

on

this
taste
is
smooth
interesting
and
different
the

feel
is

not

ml

poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
generous
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
aroma
was
fruity
an
upgrade
from
the
other
dubbels
that
i
have
had
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
but
with
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
throat
the
taste
does
nothing
to
distinguish
itself
flavor
is
not
really
helped
as
it
warms
the
feel
was
light
bodied
crisp
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
d
ive
had
better
and
i
wish
i
was
drinking
ommegang
can
slug
it
down
though
seek
others
if
it
just
had
the
complexity
of
most
other
dubbels
ive
tried
or
something
other
than
the
hop
bite
which
seems
out
of
character
for
the
style
it
could
be
quite
good
d
pretty
good
i
like
this
one
nice
tasty
sweet
fruity
treat
needless
to
say
the
allagash
dubbel
is
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
very
pleasant
experience
indeed
d
very
drinkable
especially
for
style
however
im
more
a
fan
of
truetraditional
belgian
dubbels
serving
type
bottle
malts
are
upfront
with
citrus
hops
on
backend
it
has
a
watery
finish
with
good
bitterness
that
lingers
its
a
solid
brew
that
needs
food
to
bring
out
some
of
its
underlying
characteristics
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
d
pretty
good
all
around
but
pretty
good
doesnt
really
cut
it
for
the
price
i
have
been
a
little
let
down
by
the
allagash
lineup
in
general
their
tripel
was
good
but
easily
beaten
kind
of
like
this
brew
and
their
white
which
is
their
cheapest
at
8
99
a
4
pack
is
their
best
i
wish
i
liked
these
beers
more
because
they
are
accessable
and
not
out
of
bounds
for
price
not
too
happy
with
this
one
smelled
like
spices
and
surprisingly
a
little
boozy
as
well
in
the
flavor
i
was
getting
caramel
leather
tobacco
prunes
and
figs
a
little
touch
of
yeast
and
spices
tobacco
actually
stood
out
quite
a
bit
and
not
in
a
pleasant
way
first
letdown
from
allagash
but
i
wont
let
it
deter
me
from
trying
more
of
their
brews
in
the
future
this
is
not
too
bad
good
drinker
patience
required
as
this
beer
and
style
in
general
is
nuanced
and
subtle
then
you

and
a

allagash
has

better

not
bad
in
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
i
really
enjoyed
smelling
this
beer
more
than
anything
finish
acidic
and
hard
in
the
mouth
but
really
flows
well
to
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
dark
complexity
the
feel
is
creamy
and
not
that
fizzy
makes
this
very
easy
to
chug
down
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
considering
its
7
abv
sugary
as
hell
but
dark
enough
to
be
drinkable
overall
impression
a
good
complex
beer
a
good
example
of
the
belgian
dubbel
style
because
it
is
only
7
abv
it
does
not
have
to
hot
characteristic
that
many
dark
belgians
have
this
makes
it
really
easy
to
drink
if
i
could
buy
it
locally
this
would
for
sure
make
it
into
my
regular
buys
d
i
like
this
a
bunch
finished
the
whole
750ml
rather
quickly
a
wonderful
american
effort
not
very
complex
as
noted
is
many
reviews
but
i
could
tell
a
lot
of
thought
went
into
this
brew
from
my
perspective
a
bit
of
a
muted
dubbel
but
that
increases
the
drinkability
finishes
dry
enough
to
invite
another
sip
and
another
sip
drinkability
i
could
knock
a
couple
22ozs
back
in
a
night
drinkbility
is
very
good
abv
tucked
away
nicely
and
this
is
a
very
good
belgianstyle
and
another
great
beer
from
allagash
overall
good
drinkability
nice
fruity
sweetness
and
tart
flavoraroma
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
very
drinkable
and
keeps
you
wanting
more
overall
i
would
say
that
is
not
the
best
double
i
have
had
but
it
did
have
a
lot
of
good
things
going
for
it
in
particular
i
very
much
liked
the
appearance
aroma
and
mouth
feel
worth
trying
but
not
impressive
very
complex
and
flavors
all
over
the
place
that
shift
all
the
way
through
the
beer
once
again
allagash
impresses
me
with
their
take
on
a
belgian
classic
d
how
to
sum
this
one
up
hard
tellin
flavorful
to
say
the
least
and
not
the
tiniest
indication
of
alcoholic
content
certainly
not
what
i
expected
to
taste
but
quite
pleasing
overall
and
something
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
on
tap
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
and
too
little
flavor
make
this
a
not
so
enjoyable
beer
this
is
not
something
a
would
seek
out
again

head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
aroma
is
pretty
faint
but
i
get
notes
of
dark
breads
stone
fruit
and
clove
flavor
is
more
robust
than
the
aroma
but
its
still
not
as
deep
or
complex
as
most
authentic
belgian
dubbels
figs
burnt
toast
raisins
pepper
clove
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
watery
with
somewhat
rough
carbonation
lacking
in
aroma
flavor
finesse
and
fullness
tasted
some
chocolatycoffee
and
fruit
flavors
with
a
slight
hop
flavor
very
drinkable
with
a
smooth
light
carbonation
i
had
2
and
was
feeling
pretty
good
it
was
lacking
a
bit
of
that
belgian
punch
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
dubbel
but
the
variety
of
specialty
malts
and
dark
belgian
sugar
made
for
a
tasty
and
interesting
dubbel
d
very
smooth
beer
alcohol
is
present
but
goes
down
rather
easy
i
like
this
beer
allagash
dubbel
poured
a
cloudy
rubyred
with
all
most
no
head
showed
good
lacing
smell
was
loaded
with
dark
fruit
one
of
the
fruity
noses
i
can
remember
taste
was
of
dark
berries
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
was
good
right
for
the
style
drinkability
was
also
good
this
was
a
nice
beer
good
version
of
the
style
allagash
is
one
of
the
better
belgian
style
brewers
in
the
us
an
outstanding
offering
from
allagash
over
all
a
delicious
big
beer
id
drink
again
d
drinkability
is
good
but
the
7
abv
will
have
most
imbibers
cutting
this
one
off
sooner
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
this
is
really
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
really
enjoyed
this
brew
allagash
seems
to
be
quite
the
brewery
im
relatively
new
to
the
belgians
so
i
dont
really
have
too
much
to
compare
this
to
thought
however
after
looking
around
that
this
beer
seemed
to
be
spot
on
really
great
dark
color
with
a
beautiful
fluffy
white
head
great
sweet
fruity
wheat
smells
in
the
noise
the
taste
was
great
as
well
with
a
nice
warmth
from
the
alcohol
there
is
a
ligthness
to
the
taste
that
is
enjoyable
lots
of
nice
citrusy
fruity
flavors
offset
the
alcohol
and
wheat
malt
i
always
have
trouble
judging
dubbels
i
think
the
smell
is
great
but
the
taste
never
steps
up
i
dont
know
if
this
a
characteristic
of
most
dubbels
but
im
not
sure
if
i
like
if
i
didnt
know
the
alcohol
in
this
i
would
say
this
is
a
great
sessionable
belgium
that
said
im
very
happy
this
wasnt
overly
sweet
and
boozy
like
many
belgians
this
is
something
i
could
drink
multiples
of
pours
cloudy
brown
cokelike
color
with
pretty
big
light
tan
head
smell
yeast
rye
bread
a
bit
of
caramel
very
earthy
quite
nice
taste
yeasty
upfront
sweet
malts
some
bread
smooth
finish
very
creamy
very
rich
great
stuff
very
drinkable
for
abv
i
think
it
is
my
first
dubbel
and
im
liking
it
a
lot
comes
out
of
the
tap
an
opaque
light
chocolaty
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
pale
tan
head
rich
smoky
malty
aroma
has
a
yeasty
undertone
and
invites
a
taste
flavor
is
malty
with
hints
of
cinnamon
cloves
yeast
and
caramel
very
toothsome
texture
is
very
smooth
and
leaves
behind
a
nice
tingle
this
is
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
dubbel
good
flavor
but
not
too
overpowering
it
also
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
d
easy
drinking
dubbel
lacked
the
complexity
that
i
would
have
wanted
needs
some
tweaking
this
could
be
very
good
a
smooth
pour
from
the
750
ml
bottle
results
in
a
prominent
tan
head
which
fades
fairly
quickly
but
steadily
leaving
a
small
vertical
stripe
all
around
the
goblet
smells
of
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
sour
candy
some
yeast
and
alcohol
are
interspersed
as
well
tastes
of
very
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
and
some
phenols
the
taste
is
a
bit
austere
but
somehow
it
works
as
underneath
a
few
dark
fruits
and
some
grain
exist
making
things
a
bit
more
interesting
mouthfeel
moves
toward
the
heavy
end
of
medium
theres
not
a
lot
happening
with
the
carbonation
but
theres
enough
to
keep
an
openness
to
the
entire
experience
cant
complain
here
but
if
someone
put
a
gun
to
my
head
and
made
me
choose
one
allegash
brew
it
would
be
the
tripel
brown
ruby
edges
small
head
that
fell
quickly
no
lacing
smell
is
sour
and
yeasty
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
malty
sweet
some
brown
sugar
light
chocolate
yeasty
earthy
little
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
at
all
considering
its
only
7
i
have
no
idea
how
fresh
this
is
it
doesnt
taste
like
its
gone
bad
it
just
doesnt
taste
good
im
slightly
disappointed
with
this
one
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
it
was
letdown
this
is
good
for
an
american
dubbel
but
it
pales
in
comparison
complexity
to
something
like
st
bernardus
i
need
to
try
it
out
of
the
750ml
bottle
to
see
if
theres
a
difference
i
think
that
size
might
only
be
the
reserve
version
though
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
750ml

goblet
a
golden
brown
color
with
a
thick

sticky
head
a
sweet
aroma
sometimes
like
molasses
sometimes
like
maple
syrup
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
and
i
think
a
bit
of
fig
the
beer
was
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
nevertheless
enjoyable

beer
drinkability
is
excellent
the
dry

keep
it
from
being
too
rich
and
mouthcoating
would
be
excellent
with
sweet
grilled
meats
or
smoky
cheeses
recommended
the
mouthfeel

very
unique

delicious

quite
drinkable
however
i
would
probably
not
have
more
tha
one
md
medium
bodied
and
very
sweet
a
little
too
much
for
my
taste
although
not
a
bad
beer
i
just
dont
find
it
pleasing
to
me
d
a
great
interpretation
of
a
belgian
dubbel
dubbels
arent
really
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
appreciate
a
good
on
when
i
taste
one
cheers
d
nice
beer
overall
i
was
in
a
really
foul
mood
when
i
popped
this
open
and
it
cheered
me
right
up
i
liked
this
very
solid
and
drinkable
drinkability
well
actually
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
not
nearly
the
sweet
and
complex
belgian
i
was
hoping
for
i
had
planned
on
cellaring
the
remaining
3
of
these
for
a
few
years
to
see
what
happened
but
not
so
sure
now
the
allagash
dubbel
pours
a
deep
dark
slightly
cloudy
amber
with
a
thin
head
while
other
reviewers
are
noting
raisins
and
spices
i
primarily
tasted
a
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
easily
drinkable
and
not
too
thick
this
beer
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
that
i
will
keep
stocked
in
my
refrigerator
another
win
from
allagash
who
can
seem
to
do
no
wrong
notes
a
good
dubbel
but
definitely
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
compulsively
drinkable
man
i
love
allagash
d
medium
to
medium
high
drinkabilty
i
had
two
glasses
and
i
think
it
was
enough
a
nice
beer
to
share
with
another
the
flavor
was
a
bit
too
hoppy
it
is
an
interesting
brew
but
not
close
to
representing
the
standard
dubbel
brown
slightly
cloudy
thin
but
persistent
head
nice
candy
fruit
ester
taste
no
off
aftertaste
at
all
its
just
a
wonderful
beer
d
a
decent
take
at
the
style
this
is
not
a
go
to
beer
for
the
style
but
it
is
a
good
american
take
i
enjoyed
it
overall
i
like
allagash
but
im
not
terribly
fond
of
this
beer
their
tripel
is
amazing
but
this
one
falls
short
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
really
like
to
grab
a
six
pack
for
the
holidays

my
favorite
dubbel
no
but
very
good
nice
drinkability
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
pours
a
dark
mahagony
color
with
thin
white
head
pleasant
aroma
of
cherries
and
raspberry
flavor
is
similar
to
aroma
with
hints
of
cherry
and
raspberry
but
also
contains
an
awful
syrupy
medicinal
robitussin
taste
that
left
a
nasty
after
taste
poured
a
hazy
deep
amber
with
a
large
offwhite
light
brown
head
that
lasted
with
good
lacing
complex
malty
and
alcohol
aroma
medium
body
with
flat
carbonation
solid
complex
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
spicy
soft
alcohol
finish
of
average
duration
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
chocolate
coffee
tasting
with
a
slight
bitter
after
taste
some
light
yeast
i
wrote
down
that
this
was
somewhat
different
from
most
dubbels
ive
had
its
a
good
attempt
at
a
belgian
style
but
at
the
same
time
its
got
its
own
thing
goin
on
in
a
few
different
places
appreciated
both
for
its
uniqueness
and
its
loyalty
to
its
style
the
aroma
has
malt
spice
and
leather
the
appearance
is
reddish
brown
with
a
slight
hazing
and
a
nice
head
the
flavor
is
nice
it
has
the
same
elements
as
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thinner
than
expected
but
not
bad
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
somewhat
unique
d
the
7
60
alcohol
is
certainly
present
but
not
overwhelming
but
i
still
just
could
not
see
me
having
multiple
bottles
of
this
in
one
sitting
d
pretty
good
though
only
would
get
one
at
a
time
a
very
pleasant
brew
if
not
spectacular
well
worthwhile
and
easy
to
drink
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
an
aroma
of
spices
flowers
and
citrus
medium
body
and
warming
a
taste
of
floral
spices
but
slightly
acidic
and
slightly
bitter
good
taste
though
not
as
much
flavor
as
the
triple
d
easy
to
drink
for
me
but
the
alcohol
can
sneak
up
on
you
poured
into
a
narrow
snifter
dark
brown
with
lots
of
foam
head
on
the
top
a
sweet
raisin
and
caramel
smell
a
bitter
taste
void
of
the
sweet
flavors
i
was
expecting
it
is
drinkable
but
doesnt
compare
well
to
others
of
its
style
the
taste
i
notice
is
not
similar
to
other
dubbels
at
all
after
letting
it
get
to
room
temperature
i
could
detect
a
faint
raisin
aroma
and
the
taste
was
very
smooth
still
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
a
dubbel
dark
brown
colored
ale
with
a
very
rich
slow
fading
headaroma
is
fruity
taste
is
caramel
and
fruit
pretty
good
ale
that
is
very
drinkable
i
would
most
likely
buy
again
but
not
actively
seek
out
i
think
that
this
is
decent
enough
to
try
at
least
one
time
i
poured
a
bottle
from
batch
75
into
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
white
head
if
you
hold
it
up
to
a
light
it
almost
appears
orange
the
smell
is
bready
with
a
hint
of
cough
syrup
the
beer
is
very
smooth
a
slight
bready
taste
with
a
light
phenolic
finish
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
adequite
carbonation
i
imagine
it
would
match
well
with
most
foods
as
it
is
not
an
overpowering
brew
overall
an
enjoyable
belgian
ale
nice
thick
sticky
beige
head
on
a
muddy
brown
opaque
body
aroma
is
strong
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
not
overpowering
but
very
inviting
and
mysterious
taste
is
like
blended
unsweetened
chocolate
and
cherries
very
strongly
malty
with
enough
roastyness
in
there
to
hint
at
a
darker
beer
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
really
nice
clean
flavors
of
a
belgian
without
anything
too
tricky
id
be
excited
to
see
this
at
a
bar
on
tap
very
very
drinkable
but
a
little
simple
for
a
dubble
still
very
good
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
as
it
was
no
problem
to
finish
it
bottle
at
winking
lizard
pours
a
dark
brownishamber
color
with
a
medium
thick
and
foamy
beige
head
that
has
decent
retention
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
dark
fruit
and
light
chocolate
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
hops
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
a
faint
nutty
character
and
flavors
of
fruit
chocolate
and
malt
the
finish
is
lightly
spiced
with
a
malty
aftertaste
that
lingers
awhile
above
average
overall
this
is
an
overall
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
overall
its
a
decent
brew
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
but
unlike
their
white
which
very
nearly
puts
the
belgian
witbiers
to
shame
this
one
is
only
an
approximation
of
the
trappist
brewers
art
i
do
have
one
complaint
regarding
this
beer
a
fing
screw
cap
what
the
hell
is
that
prosit
mk
d
balance
and
absence
of
alcohol
warming
make
it
frighteningly
drinkable
d
pretty
average
abv
and
decently
easy
to
drink
just
not
very
impressive
ill
probably
look
elsewhere
d
this
dubbel
makes
an
excellent
apertif
it
got
me
drooling
and
would
be
great
with
a
medium
cheddar
or
rye
bread
cheers
this
has
some
really
strong
elements
but
somethings
missing
a
little
more
to
chew
on
if
you
will
or
some
tartness
to
counter
the
sweetness
although
the
faintest
tartness
is
presenting
itself
about
halfway
through
the
malts
may
be
the
story
here
a
beer
to
ponder
after
dinner
or
even
alongside
chicken
or
fish
came
from
its
beautiful
corked
bottle
appearance
was
wicked
good
dark
cloudy
amberbrown
with
a
thick
long
lasting
head
and
creamy
lacing
aromas
are
rich
but
not
overpowering
slight
dark
grape
fruit
flavors
mixed
with
malts
the
taste
was
slightly
more
complex
than
the
aromas
the
bittersweet
flavor
had
a
more
specific
grape
flavoring
with
a
slight
woody
texture
mouthfeel
was
a
good
body
mixed
with
a
silky
and
almost
creamy
texture
overall
a
great
treat
the
flavor
is
a
touch
watered
down
dark
fruits
are
there
but
the
spice
profile
and
malts
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
for
the
style
the
finish
is
quite
muted
almost
to
the
point
of
being
bland
poured
out
of
the
bottle
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
of
tan
bubbles
displays
broken
lacing
but
not
much
retention
alcohol
esters
and
wet
malts
dominate
the
nose
with
a
slight
nuttiness
the
flavors
were
similar
chocolate
bready
malts
yeast
a
hint
of
sweetness
towards
the
end
well
balanced
despite
the
lack
of
hops
character
distinctly
different
flavor
phases
long
malty
finish
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
d
very
nice
brew
it
has
a
great
look
and
flavor
the
feel
really
takes
away
from
this
beer
this
could
be
so
much
more
ah
well
cant
win
em
all
an
enjoyable
beer
especially
when
its
67
in
august
with
the
sun
setting
while
sitting
on
the
deck
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
more
of
these
d
easy
to
drink
its
that
simple
another
great
dubbel
right
along
the
lines
with
its
style
a
very
typey
dubbel
not
a
bad
dubbel
but
fairly
typical
a
good
example
of
the
style
by
an
american
brewery
d
this
is
a
good
but
not
outstanding
dubbel
i
appreciated
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
but
couldnt
help
thinking
that
there
are
a
lot
of
dubbels
that
i
like
better
and
that
this
beer
is
not
as
good
as
the
allagash
white
or
trippel
having
said
that
these
go
down
remarkable
well
and
the
abv
can
easily
sneak
up
on
you
d
a
decent
dubbel
not
as
belgianlike
as
others
ive
had
no
typical
belgian
yeast
aromaflavor
but
enjoyable
kindof
plain
overall
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
a
style
i
need
to
explore
in
further
depth
i
am
used
to
the
bolder
flavor
profile
of
trippels
and
quads
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
7
abv
is
on
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
for
a
dubbel
but
it
makes
this
beer
much
more
drinkable
the
subdued
alcohol
flavor
also
makes
it
drinkable
the
balance
between
yeast
and
malt
makes
it
drinkable
the
only
thing
slowing
this
beer
down
is
the
hefty
thickness
of
its
body
although
this
beer
was
easy
to
drink
it
isnt
anywhere
near
a
great
dubbel
very
nice
beer
that
could
be
from
an
abbey
in
belgium
while
ive
mostly
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
one
at
any
given
time
as
its
abv
and
its
flavor
are
not
things
that
remind
me
of
ideal
session
beers
as
u
s
versions
of
belgian
beer
styles
go
its
not
quite
there
but
its
close
pours
brown
through
the
middle
but
with
big
chunky
ruby
red
highlights
big
foamy
tan
head
fades
very
slowly
and
leaves
a
tremendous
amount
of
lacing
in
the
glass
smell
is
malty
raisin
some
brown
sugar
and
maybe
a
little
orange
is
detected
taste
is
rich
malty
more
raisin
and
brown
sugar
some
clove
spice
mediumbodied
and
dry
active
carbonation
and
ultimately
really
drinkable
d
high
but
id
quickly
trade
some
of
this
drinkability
for
more
flavor
overall
pretty
nice
i
have
always
been
pleased
with
allagashs
belgian
style
beers
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
outstanding
nice
beer
not
the
best
allagash
offering
ive
had
but
worth
tossing
down
the
hatch
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
nonic
glass
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
2
inch
off
white
head
and
leaves
lacing
on
the
top
of
the
beer
aromas
of
coffee
brown
sugar
raisins
and
malt
the
taste
starts
off
light
then
you
can
taste
the
sugar
chocolate
and
raisins
and
finishes
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
the
beer
is
nice
and
light
with
low
carbonation
and
finishes
dry
a
decent
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
drinkability
was
actually
pretty
good
on
this
one
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
and
the
lack
of
any
strong
flavors
prevents
it
from
becoming
cloying
taste
is
smooth
and
the
initial
flavors
seem
to
be
a
little
less
intense
definitely
a
lot
of
malty
sweetness
but
the
rich
fruit
flavors
are
a
lot
more
hidden
the
spiciness
of
the
yeast
makes
itself
present
along
with
the
burnt
sugar
and
toast
that
are
also
present
in
the
smell
feels
like
silk
in
your
mouth
very
easy
drinking
beer
poured
into
a
goblet
it
smells
like
a
dry
beer
with
hops
spices
rum
and
dates
its
a
dark
brown
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
it
does
have
a
nice
thick
lacing
its
fairly
clear
with
only
a
little
bit
of
cloudiness
in
it
which
may
be
my
fault
it
has
a
sweet
roasted
malts
flavor
with
some
spices
coffee
beans
it
is
slightly
dry
overall
it
is
medium
bodied
and
really
warms
up
your
mouth
and
has
a
mild
bitter
aftertaste
its
pretty
smooth
overall
and
leaves
a
dry
malty
taste
in
your
mouth
mouthfeeldrinkability
liquid
velvet
in
the
mouth
unbelievable
its
impossible
to
discern
the
bubbles
in
this
beers
texture
sip
after
sip
im
marveling
at
the
balance
and
eloquence
from
start
to
finish
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
enjoyed
over
the
last
twelve
months
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
light
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
maltiness
alcohol
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
banana
smokey
alcohol
up
front
taste
leading
to
the
fruity
yeasty
flavor
finishing
with
a
burnt
coffeebitter
chocolate
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
average
drinkability
if
it
finished
a
little
smoother
would
be
higher
final
thought
a
very
nice
showing
again
from
allagash
i
would
love
to
sample
their
beers
on
tap
someday
md
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
overall
a
nice
smooth
creaminess
a
passable
dubbel
but
not
one
of
the
better
examples
d
due
to
it
being
very
balanced
with
no
alcohol
warming
at
all
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
dubbel
d
got
better
and
smoother
as
it
warmed
up
from
teh
inital
hoppiness
would
not
go
back
for
this
one
but
would
recommend
to
pale
ale
blokes
d
a
very
fulfilling
beer
like
liquid
bread
that
really
hits
that
spot
i
can
tell
there
is
a
raisiny
sweetness
there
as
the
glass
is
drained
earthy
lovely
and
expertly
crafted
this
is
a
must
try
dubbel
m
d
a
foamy
richness
in
the
mouth
which
feels
quite
good
all
the
way
down
a
little
more
mild
in
overall
experience
than
some
other
belgians
or
belgianstyled
that
i
have
had
but
thats
not
a
particularly
bad
thing
i
would
have
it
again
though
would
likely
reconsider
location
this
bottle
was
ice
cold
and
took
forever
to
warm
up
final
thoughts
it
was
ok
form
me
not
really
my
style
of
brew
d
fairly
decent
for
a
dubbel
they
are
usually
harder
to
drink
but
more
enjoyable
this
is
closer
to
my
preference
than
a
fullblown
belgian
but
it
doesnt
match
the
traditional
flavors
of
the
style
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
without
the
heaviness
for
me
that
worked
well
for
others
it
might
not
but
id
buy
this
one
again
d
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
dubbels
but
im
enjoying
this
one
not
too
complex
and
malty
as
hell
though
i
wish
i
could
distill
some
hops
flavors
out
of
it
its
still
quite
a
decent
beer
d
not
terrible
but
not
a
dubbel
that
i
would
ever
seek
out
again
or
even
recommend
a
pleasant
double
but
nothing
special
a
little
too
watery
and
lacking
in
the
finish
an
interesting
and
different
dubbel
definitely
wellmade
and
worth
aging
a
bottle
for
a
year
or
two
to
see
if
it
changes
a
little
unbalanced
and
lacking
in
complexity
but
i
applaud
how
the
spiciness
and
lightness
keep
sweetness
in
check
and
keep
it
more
drinakble
than
many
american
takes
on
belgian
styles
overall
it
was
a
very
mediocre
dubbel
which
surprised
me
as
i
enjoy
most
of
what
allagash
makes
ill
have
to
try
a
few
more
of
these
before
my
mind
is
totally
made
up
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
malt
and
yeast
with
a
bit
of
perfume
and
alcohol
it
tasted
bland
at
first
with
malt
and
slight
wild
hops
flavoring
the
taste
grew
stronger
and
better
as
it
warmed
and
it
had
a
nice
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
it
was
watery
and
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
overall
it
started
out
boring
but
then
became
pretty
enjoyable
looks
a
dark
ruby
red
with
white
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
blackberry
and
plum
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
grains
the
taste
has
sweet
bready
malts
with
slight
date
and
raisin
flavors
there
are
also
mellow
caramel
and
toasted
notes
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
vanilla
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
light
for
the
style
but
very
drinkable
the
carbonation
is
also
a
bit
light
but
its
very
pleasant
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
dubbel
and
it
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
allagash
beers
thank
you
maine
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
with
a
lot
of
substance
to
it
i
could
drink
a
few
of
them
but
i
dont
think
its
one
that
id
want
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
deep
brown
and
amber
not
enough
foam
for
this
dubbel
or
bubbling
or
lacing
great
color
for
this
belgian
style
just
lacking
a
few
other
elements
the
aroma
is
awesome
full
of
nuts
cherries
hardwood
and
even
a
little
leather
very
complex
the
first
sip
is
a
deep
toasted
malt
the
middle
gets
a
little
more
fruity
cherries
mostly
then
a
woody
mlat
with
a
little
more
roast
coming
through
to
the
finish
along
with
a
few
nuts
and
some
pumperknickel
bread
the
palate
feels
real
good
sweet
toasty
and
just
the
right
amount
of
dryness
great
for
meats
with
a
brown
sauce
lots
of
garlic
d
drinkable
but
not
particularly
complex
the
flavor
comes
off
as
a
bit
weak
and
watery
the
roasted
flavor
is
a
bit
too
strong
for
my
taste
and
it
lacks
some
of
the
rich
caramel
and
fruit
notes
i
would
like
to
see
in
a
dubbel
d
overall
the
beer
was
very
cleanly
brewed
with
a
nice
toasted
caramel
sweetness
and
alcohol
warming
great
drinkability
poured
a
very
dark
amber
color
from
batch
number
68
aroma
was
very
sweet
and
mildly
fruity
flavors
of
dark
fruit
lightly
spiced
with
malt
carrying
throughout
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fizzy
but
welcoming
drinkability
is
high
given
the
7
abv
overall
another
good
offering
from
allagash
from
a
750
ml
cc
bottle
66
this
poured
the
color
of
cranberry
juice
with
a
nice
cream
offwhite

and
great
lacing
simply
beautiful
nose
iof
fruit
chocolate
nuts
and
caramel
malts
rich
and
smooth
mouthfeel
robust
flavors
with
a
long
dry
finish
wonder
if
aging
would
have
helped
this
but
this
is
the
only
bottle
i
had
this
brew
pours
dark
like
cola
a
1
finger
head
decent
lacing
scent
is
malty
spicy
perhaps
brown
sugar
slight
coffee
aroma
as
well
spicy
in
flavor
a
cookie
like
malt
nice
well
balanced
flavor
med
body
overall
a
rather
drinkable
brew
id
drink
this
again
d
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
effort
allagash
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
this
beer
does
not
stack
up
well
with
others
in
this
styles
its
an
easy
brew
to
drink
as
long
as
you
can
get
by
the
bite
of
the
over
the
top
carbonation
drinkability
is
medium
to
high
due
to
great
flavors
12oz
bottle
consumed
about
six
months
after
purchase
im
guessing
i
wasnt
sure
how
well
this
was
going
to
age
i
hadnt
realized
this
was
bottle
conditioned
until
i
just
looked
it
up
now
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
bit
of
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
spice
the
flavour
follows
exactly
the
same
way
but
with
the
spice
more
prevalent
than
was
on
the
nose
tastes
in
a
similar
vein
to
some
winter
seasonal
beers
that
ive
been
having
recently
enjoyable
stuff
if
the
traditional
belgian
brewers
make
the
best
beer
in
the
world
then
their
american
cousins
are
hot
on
their
heels
try
any
beer
in
the
allagash
lineup
and
taste
the
quality
and
craftsmanship
of
the
belgianstyle
in
american
hands
quite
pleasant
drinkable
overall
even
if
not
among
my
favorites
in
the
style
lots
of
flavor
on
every
gulp
making
this
one
a
sipper
still
a
lot
of
carbonation
going
this
one
would
go
great
with
some
beef
stew
or
oysters
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
head
into
my
chalice
what
little
head
there
is
stays
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
absolutely
fantastic
vanilla
raisins
sweet
malt
yeast
an
over
abundance
of
wonderful
aromas
taste
is
good
but
not
up
to
the
level
of
the
aroma
it
is
a
good
beer
has
a
good
full
taste
to
it
but
isnt
nearly
as
complex
as
it
smells
very
good
beer
could
of
been
great
drinkability
this
drink
is
very
drinkable
it
goes
very
well
with
steak
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
is
good
for
catching
up
with
a
good
friend
and
want
to
get
beyond
the
macro
brews
and
keep
it
local
this
was
out
of
a
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
jumbo
tulip
stella
artois
bottle
conditioned
batch
69
at
45
degrees
good
carbonation
and
nice
slow
pour
yields
a
brownpurple
beer
with
a
tight
bubbled
bone
white
head
which
after
finishing
maintained
thou
out
good
lacing
smells
fresh
bright
and
slightly
sour
with
a
hint
of
bread
very
dry
nose
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
something
malt
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
just
the
right
carb
to
lighten
it
up
tastes
of
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
burnt
as
well
as
a
bit
of
apricot
not
much
in
the
hop
smell
taste
or
bitter
a
little
on
the
latter
very
clean
dry
finish
probably
a
great
beer
with
spicy
food
or
a
peppercorn
steak
could
hold
up
to
just
about
any
hearty
foods
drink
ability
is
dangerous
luckily
the
abv
is
not
too
high
drinkability
medium
but
not
low
clearly
this
is
not
a
session
beer
but
the
rest
of
the
bottle
will
readily
fill
this
glass
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
there
isnt
too
much
by
this
brewery
that
i
frown
upon
a
good
one
to
have
in
the
rotation
in
general
this
is
a
decent
drinking
beer
i
think
that
it
might
do
a
little
better
with
some
further
aging
the
allagash
dubbel
had
a
dark
brownishamber
appearance
with
little
head
when
poured
there
was
a
slight
tinge
of
fruit
in
the
smell
but
not
as
obvious
as
with
other
dubbels
the
taste
was
okay
yielding
some
apple
flavors
and
other
fruits
despite
this
the
taste
was
a
little
underwhelming
with
an
inescapably
bland
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
too
tingly
and
carbonated
for
my
palate
overall
its
a
drinkable
beer
though
there
are
many
other
very
good
dubbels
straight
from
belgium
i
would
go
for
first
pours
a
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
very
tight
creamy
head
that
sticks
around
the
aromas
are
beautifully
balanced
with
a
slight
sourness
slightly
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
a
touch
of
almond
and
hazlenut
all
intermingling
very
nice
the
taste
is
very
nice
but
a
tad
too
subtle
gentle
flavors
dark
dry
malt
quite
attenuated
apple
brandy
flavors
with
a
touch
of
sweet
fruit
as
well
slightly
tannic
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
this
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
nice
easytodrink
dubbel
but
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
bottle
copped
singly
from
total
wine
and
more
in
west
orange
great
appearance
dark
rubyred
offcolor
brown
with
modest
head
a
prunecolored
beer
smell
is
sweet
reminiscent
of
figs
prunes
and
fruits
allagash
white
is
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
so
had
high
hopes
for
this
wellrespected
brewery
didnt
disappoint
really
good
taste
tastes
very
sweet
with
fig
flavors
some
cinnammon
sweetness
with
added
fruity
tones
similar
to
a
doppelbock
good
depiction
of
the
style
good
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
would
never
notice
teh
7abv
behind
a
palate
of
thick
rich
sweetness
definitely
recommended
drinkability
is
good
this
was
a
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
if
you
blindfolded
me
id
swear
it
was
a
brown
ale
and
a
nice
attempt
at
it
misses
the
mark
for
a
dubbel
but
still
enjoyable
perhaps
this
one
needs
some
time
to
age
and
develop
im
not
familiar
with
allagash
as
theyve
just
recently
begun
to
be
available
in
michigan
sadly
this
particular
beer
was
a
disappointment
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
very
nice
dark
amber
with
a
very
bright
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
ripe
fruit
maybe
raisins
and
brown
sugar
unsatisfying
in
the
best
way
to
describe
the
taste
watery
sweetness
with
very
little
balance
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
serviceable
eh
this
is
drinkable
i
guess
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
no
recommendation
either
way
hearty
full
and
even
its
smooth
with
clean
tones
almost
a
nutty
flavor
to
it
i
think
youd
want
to
drink
this
with
a
hearty
meal
a
meat
and
potatoes
kind
of
thing
but
hey
that
is
just
my
immature
palates
wild
guess
i
know
allagash
makes
a
lot
of
different
stuff
so
i
would
be
quicker
to
try
the
others
before
coming
back
to
this
one
nice
two
finger
head
on
the
pour
and
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
slightly
metallic
and
did
not
waver
me
one
way
or
the
other
pours
a
nice
dark
color
has
some
roasty
malts
with
a
nice
touch
of
belgian
yeast
a
crowd
pleaser
for
sure
a
bit
thin
on
the
body
but
can
be
viewed
as
a
session
beer
as
this
was
really
i
mean
really
easy
to
drink
d
very
approachable
and
drinkable
just
not
really
as
complex
as
i
would
care
for
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
very
good
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
as
to
drinkability
i
can
only
ask
one
question
i
spent
how
much
for
this
these
guys
sell
this
stuff
in
four
packs
and
command
a
princely
sum
but
theyre
insulting
the
style
with
their
limp
effort
wont
revisit
this
one
unless
its
offered
free
otherwise
its
time
for
allagash
to
give
this
brew
the
dirt
nap
well
its
drinkable
for
sure
not
more
than
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
though
put
it
next
to
some
of
the
classics
from
belgium
and
it
falls
short
imo
dnot
that
great
disappointed
in
this
one
poured
out
of
the
12oz
bottle
with
the
label
reading
dubbel
ale
with
a
7
0
abv
per
review
of
the
website
the
dubbel
reserve
only
comes
in
the
750ml
so
i
believe
i
have
the
correct
beer
here
the
appearance
is
a
murky
dark
ruby
brown
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
left
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
old
dusty
chocolate
a
little
spice
and
earthy
qualities
could
be
a
little
stronger
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
sweet
berry
flavor
which
is
quickly
subdued
by
a
complex
malt
profile
the
malt
has
musty
chocolate
characteristics
which
lead
into
a
sligh
belgian
spice
and
candi
sugar
flavor
the
feel
is
a
tad
thin
with
soft
carbonation
finishes
slightly
bitter
a
good
american
version
of
the
dubbel
nice
flavor
profile
very
drinkable
for
the
type
of
beer
it
is
with
its
high
abv
one
cant
drink
a
ton
without
some
serious
side
effects
d
at
only
7
this
is
exceptionally
drinkable
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
tulip
glass
dark
rubycopper
tone
with
nice
offwhite
head
about
a
thick
mostly
fruit
in
the
nose
taste
of
nuts
and
raisins
but
thin
and
almost
watery
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
from
all
the
hype
not
that
i
couldnt
put
back
a
few
but
id
probably
reach
for
something
else
had
the
fluxus
at
the
brickstore
and
was
much
more
inpressed
this
was
the
first
time
i
saw
allagash
anything
in
michigan
so
i
had
to
pick
it
up
im
not
sure
of
this
beer
being
considered
a
dubbel
if
i
did
a
blind
tasting
i
would
think
this
this
is
an
english
brown
fermented
with
belgian
yeast
the
smell
was
a
bit
yeasty
with
fusel
in
the
background
the
taste
was
overwhelmingly
chocolate
so
much
so
that
it
practically
hid
the
plumraisin
characteristic
i
expected
from
this
style
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
and
watery
overall
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
it
just
doesnt
go
down
like
i
think
a
dubbel
should
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful
caramel
scent
along
with
a
mild
yeast
fruitiness
its
dry
with
some
raisiny
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
dry
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
watery
with
some
yeast
esters
i
love
the
malt
flavor
it
has
a
nice
caramel
and
raisin
feel
but
its
a
bit
thin
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
got
excellent
malt
flavor
as
well
as
a
very
aromatic
yeast
presence
pours
rich
reddish
brown
with
thin
off
white
head
and
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
passing
up
through
the
body
interesting
wavy
lace
that
becomes
spotty
malty
smell
with
sweet
cookie
and
hint
of
sour
yeast
good
warm
malt
with
sugary
sweetness
for
the
initial
flavor
transitions
smoothly
to
a
slightly
acidic
and
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
good
complexity
and
very
enjoyable
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
creamy
texture
active
carbonation
and
a
dry
slightly
alcoholic
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
taster
that
is
pleasantly
complex
i
liked
it
much
better
than
their
tripel
but
that
is
probably
somewhat
of
a
style
preference
for
me
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
as
another
good
example
of
an
american
brewed
belgianstyle
dub
drinkability
a
solid
take
on
the
style
drinkability
enjoyable
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
an
individual
who
may
not
appreciate
the
excess
complexity
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
i
recommend
picking
one
up
to
enjoy
with
a
friend

this
dubbel
had
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
dirtywhite
head
floating
on
top
a
musty
smell
at
first
and
a
pleasant
taste
with
chocolate
and
estery
flavors
i
liked
this
beer
and
it
was
easy
to
drink
very
nice
dubbel
and
at
6
a
bottle
a
pretty
good
deal
d
this
beer
tricks
you
into
thinking
it
is
more
than
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
slightly
hazy
raisin
pudding
brown
body
with
coppery
edges
and
a
hefty
finger
of
thick
lacy
light
khaki
head
estery
bubble
gum
and
sweetish
fruits
on
the
nose
along
with
a
mildly
floral
edge
light
toasted
grain
up
front
before
toffeeish
malts
and
fruits
come
in
herbal
hop
bitterness
and
spices
anise
around
the
edges
figs
and
bubblegum
fruits
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
not
bad
but
just
missing
something
to
pull
it
all
together
and
the
bubblegum
is
a
little
strong
poured
from
a
fat
shortie
into
a
watou
chalice
the
beer
looked
real
nice
with
a
dark
reddish
copper
hue
tranlucent
and
a
thin
but
uncompromising
head
the
aroma
wasnt
as
enticing
as
my
favorite
dubbels
westmalle
st
bernardus
prior
8
pater
6
but
sweet
and
inviting
nonetheless
the
flavor
was
nice
but
not
really
complex
mostly
sweet
malts
and
possibly
a
little
bit
of
burnt
malt
as
well
nice
beer
a
little
simple
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
but
nice
d
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
but
it
leaves
me
wanting
more
more
sweetness
more
fruitiness
just
more
but
maybe
im
being
too
greedy
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
subtle
if
one
dimensional
dubbel
highly
drinkable
and
hides
it
abv
quite
well
this
poured
into
my
chimay
chalice
a
nice
dark
brown
disappointingly
with
little
head
most
dubbels
ive
had
are
exploding
with
head
not
this
one
smell
is
sweet
malty
and
fruity
taste
is
like
that
too
alcohol
is
undetectable
in
this
one
too
nothing
suggests
even
in
the
least
that
the
abv
of
this
stuff
is
7
6
there
is
very
little
in
the
way
of
belgian
style
dubbels
that
even
come
close
to
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
its
quite
good
and
considerably
less
expensive
than
the
genuine
article
id
recommend
it
pours
brown
with
hints
of
copper
and
just
under
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
little
lacing
aroma
is
a
bit
malty
but
mostly
dark
fruits
namely
plums
and
raisins
possibly
sour
cherries
aroma
is
good
but
a
bit
to
fruity
for
the
style
too
onedimensional
taste
is
reminiscent
of
the
aroma
at
first
the
dark
fruits
from
the
aroma
return
but
give
way
to
malt
flavors
mostly
toasted
andor
crystal
and
some
spiciness
that
reminds
me
of
cloves
coupled
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
good
mouthfeel
medium
body
medium
carbonation
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
warming
drinkability
is
ok
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
in
my
opinion
the
dark
fruits
are
just
a
bit
too
dominant
and
make
this
slightly
less
drinkable
than
it
would
have
otherwise
been
dubbel
reserve
isnt
the
equal
of
most
of
what
these
guys
brew
but
then
allagashs
best
is
some
of
the
finest
beer
in
the
world
anyone
looking
to
dip
a
toe
into
the
dubbel
style
could
do
a
whole
lot
worse
than
to
start
right
here
forget
toes
once
this
review
is
completed
i
plan
to
plunge
into
the
rest
of
this
750
with
reckless
abandon
i
reserve
the
right
to
review
this
one
again
someday
and
perhaps
reach
a
completely
different
conclusion
im
not
convinced
im
tasting
what
the
brewer
intended
not
sure
what
could
have
happened
to
this
batch
or
bottle
pours
a
nice
semiclear
mahogony
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tan
head
some
nice
slicks
and
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
yeasty
hint
of
raisins
figs
plums
and
some
caramel
the
tasty
is
malty
nice
dose
of
dark
fruits
just
a
slight
yeasty
feel
and
some
caramel
medium
body
but
a
little
watery
a
nice
complex
brew
though
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
dubbel
from
allagash
definitely
want
to
try
others
from
the
line
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
a
down
to
earth
interpretation
of
a
dubbel
overall
its
a
good
if
somewhat
pedestrian
double
not
a
bad
option
to
have
hanging
around
but
nothing
to
go
nuts
trying
to
find
either
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
and
the
7
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
one
that
i
will
probably
venture
to
have
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
smooth
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
good
among
the
best
usbrewed
belgianstyle
ales
ive
had
its
lacking
some
of
the
complexities
of
its
old
world
counterparts
but
its
still
a
really
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
works
well
on
its
own
for
many
occasions
ill
certainly
get
this
again
nice
creamy
light
tan
head
smells
of
delicious
yeast
and
malt
also
has
some
hints
of
sweetness
fruit
maybe
the
taste
is
a
little
different
theres
a
bitterness
to
it
that
isnt
in
the
smell
to
be
perfectly
honest
my
first
thought
was
doh
i
wish
it
tasted
more
like
it
smells
not
to
say
its
bad
just
a
tad
let
down
after
finding
out
how
good
it
smells
i
guess
i
can
kinda
smell
the
bitterness
more
now
could
all
be
in
my
head
cant
decide
if
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
or
if
its
spices
or
even
carbonation
could
be
carbonation
there
are
plenty
of
little
bubbles
still
going
up
to
the
top
as
with
many
beers
of
this
and
similar
styles
the
sweetness
seems
more
bitter
in
the
taste
have
warmed
up
to
the
taste
a
little
since
i
started
drinking
it
still
have
to
say
my
hopes
were
set
a
little
higher
after
having
the
allagash
white
head
is
still
sticking
around
some
lacing
too
fairly
complex
taste
overall
im
sure
im
missing
something
in
there
understated
with
less
yeast
character
than
most
belgians
but
very
tasty
a
subtle
offering
which
i
think
stands
out
more
because
of
its
tastefulness
than
most
american
interpretations
of
the
style
pours
a
deep
blackcherry
red
with
a
fair
head
classic
fruity
ale
aroma
the
taste
is
malty
but
clean
with
some
dried
fruit
maybe
a
little
peach
and
more
fruit
creeping
in
at
the
end
only
to
be
washed
away
by
a
solid
but
not
particularly
intense
hop
finish
i
would
love
to
try
this
after
its
had
a
chance
to
mature
because
right
now
its
a
good
solid
dubbel
but
its
just
not
distinctive
enough
to
grab
my
attention
overall
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
review
this
but
this
simply
isnt
for
me
my
other
one
will
most
likely
be
used
as
trade
bait
d
since
its
not
as
complex
as
many
a
dubbel
its
easily
drinkable
however
the
converse
is
true
its
not
as
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
not
much
carbonation
apparent
the
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
some
hints
of
fruit
mainly
raisin
and
some
coffee
characteristics
taste
isnt
far
away
from
the
aroma
with
more
of
a
malty
coffee
flavor
and
not
much
else
in
the
taste
definitely
a
strong
one
malty
but
definitely
not
chewy
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
uninspiring
not
bad
but
i
can
say
that
ive
had
better
a
4pack
of
12
oz
bottles
i
bought
from
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
aroma
yields
an
earthy
yeasty
smell
it
has
a
strong
malt
taste
with
raisin
and
date
tones
without
a
great
deal
of
sweetness
but
a
slight
hint
of
sour
the
tartness
of
the
alcohol
is
also
apparent
from
a
deep
sniff
not
very
hoppy
nor
bitter
but
a
thick
mouthfeel
lingers
on
the
tongue
and
the
back
of
the
throat
nice
drinkability
if
you
dont
mind
the
yeast
coating
your
tongue
it
goes
very
well
with
mediterranean
food
pours
opaque
coppertinged
brown
with
small
but
persistent
creamy
tan
head
the
smell
is
entirely
appropriate
for
the
style
full
of
candi
sugar
cherries
caramel
and
alcohollaced
tropical
fruit
in
flavor
the
beer
tends
more
towards
fruity
softness
and
toasted
malt
pineapple
and
pear
notes
lead
to
a
semisweet
caramel
and
cocoa
powder
center
finishes
with
drying
toasted
biscuit
and
coffee
malt
notes
and
some
warming
spicy
alcohol
fruitiness
the
mediumrich
body
is
heavily
slanted
towards
creaminess
becoming
increasingly
smooth
and
luxurious
as
the
beer
warms
a
very
good
dubbel
overall
drinkability
is
good
and
is
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
tasty
belgian
inspired
ale
of
quality
drinkability
very
good
this
is
an
easy
drinker
for
such
a
complex
beer
as
most
know
allagash
brewing
is
one
of
the
best
americanbelgian
breweries
in
the
states
the
beer
is
a
great
example
of
their
abilities
and
quality
over
all
this
wasnt
a
great
dubbel
but
it
was
still
good
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
unless
it
was
on
tap
someplace
i
think
allagash
played
it
a
little
too
safe
with
this
beer
fermentation
must
have
been
kept
too
cool
too
long
because
there
seems
to
be
a
huge
void
where
some
belgian
yeast
characteristics
should
be
im
being
pretty
critical
so
id
like
to
repeat
this
still
is
a
good
beer
just
not
fantastic
uninspiring
especially
considering
the
two
i
had
before
this
one
pours
a
chestnutty
redish
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
decent
lacing
tiny
bubbles
make
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
reveals
a
malt
forward
brew
with
a
chalky
candied
vanilla
aroma
with
some
definite
earthiness
taste
reveals
more
of
the
same
with
an
more
alcoholic
finish
than
expected
and
some
lingering
chalkiness
perhaps
some
oxidation
in
the
bottle
theres
kind
of
a
bitey
carbonation
that
im
not
too
fond
of
but
the
beer
is
pretty
creamy
feeling
other
than
that
im
going
to
leave
the
mouthfeel
as
an
average
rating
and
blame
it
on
oxidation
an
okay
beer
not
the
best
allagash
brew
ive
ever
had
but
still
drinkable
dark
amber
brown
in
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
creamy
head
smell
is
nutty
with
spiced
fruits
with
a
toffy
sweetness
taste
is
spicy
fruits
toffee
with
a
good
hop
bite
and
a
carbonation
zing
having
a
medium
mouthfeel
though
for
me
its
a
little
too
much
on
the
carbonation
side
i
would
like
to
try
another
batch
to
get
a
new
perspective
on
it
d
a
good
melding
of
flavor
and
fairly
subtle
masking
of
the
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
thanks
for
the
chance
jpagewatts
d
it
is
pretty
good
i
have
had
some
better
dubbels
the
fruits
dont
come
through
as
big
as
i
would
of
expected
the
flavor
is
also
very
soft
malty
fruity
balanced
subtule
not
any
flavor
over
powering
the
other
i
really
like
this
brewery
they
have
the
belgian
brewing
down
an
american
chimay
pours
a
deep
murky
tealike
brown
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
retains
fairly
well
aroma
consists
of
clove
raison
and
belgian
spice
taste
falls
right
in
line
behind
the
aroma
with
clove
and
raison
flavors
this
beer
also
has
a
pronounced
and
complex
malt
flavor
when
followed
by
the
alcohol
warmth
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
warm
bread
plum
and
yeast
flavors
are
on
the
back
end
before
a
pretty
clean
finish
body
is
somewhat
light
for
a
dubbel
and
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
but
this
beer
still
drinks
quite
easily
worth
a
try
but
too
pricey
for
what
it
is
in
my
estimation
batch
40
750
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
a
deep
mahogony
verging
on
somewhere
between
ruby
and
amber
through
a
light
a
hefty
off
white
head
develops
that
never
falls
thinner
than
an
eigth
inch
bubbled
lacings
spattered
here
and
there
the
aroma
develops
as
it
warms
yeasty
and
malty
herbal
hops
play
in
the
background
as
some
bananas
sit
around
and
play
cards
a
little
too
reserved
for
me
the
taste
is
better
though
still
mellow
just
better
developed
a
woodiness
that
pairs
well
with
the
fruity
esters
and
malty
goodness
some
chocolate
unfortunately
there
is
simply
too
much
carbonationhere
to
appreciate
everything
and
it
doesnt
fade
as
it
warms
and
sits
and
its
only
saved
by
the
decent
body
and
dry
finish
that
seems
to
counterbalance
everything
else
out
in
sum
id
like
to
love
this
on
but
i
continue
to
be
underwhelmed
by
allagash
mouthfeel
doesnt
redeem
this
one
this
is
a
good
quality
dubbel
from
allagash
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
thing
lacking
but
thats
just
me
being
picky
overall
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
this
is
ok
but
i
dont
really
like
this
one
very
much
there
is
just
something
about
this
that
i
just
dont
like
i
think
probably
it
is
the
clove
taste
that
kills
this
one
for
me
recommended
d
a
good
solid
interpretation
of
a
belgian
classic
easy
to
drink
while
providing
enough
to
ponder
in
particular
all
of
the
flavours
other
than
dry
bitter
minerals
in
this
were
very
very
understated
for
a
dubbel
with
no
unfermentables
on
which
to
ride
its
little
surprise
taste
comes
through
stronger
than
the
aroma
not
with
the
depth
of
a
belgian
but
still
good
sensed
dried
fruit
and
light
chocolate
hints
actually
its
taste
gives
it
a
better
drinkability
this
is
another
good
solid
offering
from
an
outstanding
brewery
this
pours
a
peasant
light
amber
with
a
decent
head
the
head
seemed
to
increase
in
size
and
retention
as
it
was
consumed
nice
the
smell
is
of
rich
dark
fruits
primarily
of
apples
pears
plums
etc
these
continue
into
the
taste
with
a
nice
backing
of
slight
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
weak
component
of
the
beer
as
it
is
very
watery
however
quite
drinkable
m
full
bodied
with
full
dextrin
textures
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
nice
and
the
finish
is
quite
dry
my
mouth
feels
the
way
it
does
after
eating
pancakes
with
syrup
only
drier
maybe
the
pour
into
a
dixie
cup
had
something
to
do
with
it¬Ö
i
guess
this
is
drinkable
but
i
will
not
be
buying
it
again
not
a
good
effort
from
such
a
great
brewery
poured
out
dark
cloudy
and
brown
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
sugar
molasses
bread
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
but
with
a
slightly
smokey
aspect
this
aspect
is
a
bit
much
but
the
molasses
and
alcohol
and
a
big
bite
that
balances
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
bit
of
carbonated
bite
the
finish
is
ever
so
slightly
on
the
huge
side
pours
a
hazy
brown
some
orange
thick
tan
head
forms
sticks
for
the
long
haul
tons
of
lace
smell
is
sweet
spices
yeast
toffee
fruits
minor
funk
taste
is
sweet
up
front
spices
and
yeast
hit
through
the
middle
with
malty
toffee
goodness
some
spice
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
great
balance
very
easy
to
drink
probably
my
favourite
nontrappist
dubbel
clear
deep
amber
with
ruby
highlights
it
poured
with
a
rocky
tan
head
that
left
clumpy
lacing
behind
malty
aroma
light
chocolate
yeasty
bread
fruity
with
some
raisin
and
plum
light
alcohol
same
in
the
flavour
with
lingering
malt
and
alcohol
warmth
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
high
side
light
dryness
pretty
nice
overall
another
allagash
beer
that
ive
enjoyed
d
not
really
sure
how
this
gets
categorized
as
a
dubbel
except
that
is
loaded
with
sugar
gets
a
bit
sticky
after
a
while
d
great
taste
im
sure
much
better
if
it
sat
in
the
celler
for
a
few
years
from
the
taste
of
this
im
sure
their
tripels
are
amazing
im
not
really
a
huge
belgian
fanatic
although
i
get
random
cravings
but
this
is
as
good
as
most
imports
at
12
the
cost
if
you
like
the
style
this
comes
highly
recommended
yet
another
enjoyable
offering
from
allagash
drinkability
first
chance
to
purchase
this
beer
never
seen
it
near
nebraska
im
glad
i
did
my
kind
of
beer
d
ill
finish
the
750ml
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
that
though
im
just
getting
back
into
belgians
but
overall
this
was
nice
much
more
crisp
and
way
drier
than
anything
ive
had
before
the
hard
candy
sugary
sweetness
was
barely
detectable
poured
a
muddy
dark
brown
color
with
a
whiteish
head
with
good
retention
smell
was
spicey
with
a
bit
of
clove
seemed
different
light
taste
of
brown
sugar
and
spice
and
a
little
clove
just
seemed
bland
light
bodied
high
carbonation
really
light
and
dry
on
the
tongue
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
just
a
little
let
down
i
may
try
it
again
sometime
to
see
if
i
was
missing
something
but
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
the
head
is
fairly
dense
and
retentive
with
a
very
very
sticky
lacing
color
is
dark
brown
to
black
the
smell
is
fruity
and
slightly
sour
with
some
clove
sticky
caramel
and
some
sour
plum
it
also
has
a
woody
smell
to
it
taste
is
light
and
fast
to
leave
the
palate
leaving
you
wondering
what
it
tasted
like
hard
to
tell
besides
the
help
of
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
and
smooth
overall
it
doesnt
hold
a
bold
enough
flavor
for
me
to
try
again
d
not
my
favorite
dubbel
its
not
trying
to
simply
copy
the
westmalles
and
chimays
of
the
world
but
the
result
isnt
terribly
complex
lots
of
malt
lots
of
burnt
sweetness
and
barely
any
yeast
contribution
at
all
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
ill
be
sticking
with
the
trappists
on
this
one
price
be
damned
poured
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
1
finger
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
aroma
was
malty
with
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
nose
other
than
that
not
much
smell
to
this
one
taste
was
of
sweet
caramel
malts
spicesclove
maybe
chocolatey
notes
and
almond
the
body
was
light
to
medium
in
the
palate
drinkability
was
slightly
better
than
average
not
a
bad
dubbel
but
not
a
great
one
either
given
other
choices
id
probably
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future

noted
on
the
label
pours
out
a
murky
dark
brown
that
reminds
me
of
the
color
of
dates
somewhat
thin
and
tannish
head
seems
to
hold
up
but
doesnt
impress
too
much
smells
of
toasted
and
roasted
malts
dried
fruit
and
a
little
like
rc
cola
phenolics
are
subdued
and
have
to
be
searched
for
some
alcohol
present
this
is
really
far
from
what
i
expected
when
i
think
of
a
dubbel
but
im
digging
it
starts
off
with
a
mix
of
cola
and
dates
which
reminds
me
of
a
malty
doppelbock
soon
the
toasted
and
roasted
malt
come
in
giving
me
flavors
like
that
of
a
porter
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
and
the
coffeelike
lingering
flavor
of
the
malt
phenolics
kind
of
get
run
out
of
this
beer
by
the
other
flavors
but
they
are
present
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
could
be
thicker
and
have
more
mellow
carbonation
for
my
tastes
this
weirdo
dubbeldoppelbockporter
tasting
thing
keeps
it
interesting
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
undercarbonated

little
slick

very
drinkable

almost
opaque
with
thick

is
at

a

spicey
yeasty

as
many

do

roasty

and
spicy

not

sweet
spicy
and
citrusy

notes
definitely
there
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
it¬ís
rather
good
though
allagash
has
an
incredibly
solid
dubbel
here
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
has
tons
of
complexity
and
never
gets
too
sweet
or
overwhealming

characteristic
of
dubbels
and
abbey
ales
easy
drinking
at
a
good
price
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
interesting
cascade
effect
and
a
huge
head
which
leaves
interesting
lacing
smell
is
faint
but
when
its
really
teased
out
there
is
almost
a
bit
of
coffee
too
it
with
of
course
a
good
amount
of
sweet
malts
the
first
25
of
the
taste
seems
to
be
neutral
then
it
explodes
and
develops
mostly
with
the
taste
of
sweet
malts
the
carbonation
is
perfect
making
the
taste
almost
dance
on
the
tongue
while
slowing
making
its
way
down
your
throat
very
clean
finish
with
only
the
malts
lingering
drinkabiltyoverall
an
easy
drinking
dubbel
nothing
jumps
out
at
you
and
nothing
offends
you
guess
that
means
its
wellmade
but
i
feel
like
i
did
back
in
high
school
when
my
soccer
team
tied
sometimes
a
result
even
a
loss
would
have
been
more
satisfying
drinkability
the
ale
is
quite
drinkable
although
it
is
a
little
too
heavy
for
a
scorching
august
day
very
mild
and
easy
to
drink
the
high
abv
is
completely
hidden
so
smooth
and
mild
you
will
wonder
where
it
went
poured
into
a
maredsous
chalice
the
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
very
little
head
the
smell
was
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
with
really
not
much
else
going
on
the
taste
was
much
like
the
aroma
with
not
much
complexity
and
a
dry
and
acidic
aftertaste
there
was
very
little
carbonation
and
the
body
was
decent
an
o
k
but
not
a
great
dubel
overall
it
was
a
tasty
beer
but
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
the
high
alcohol
also
makes
drinking
too
much
of
this
difficult
a
fairly
unique
dubbel
here
i
cant
help
but
think
it
will
take
on
new
facets
next
time
theres
something
in
its
depths
thats
eluding
me
but
i
do
know
this
it
tastes
very
good
and
i
hope
to
always
have
one
of
these
waiting
in
the
cellar
i
had
this
beer
from
the
bottle
labeled
batch
56
the
color
and
head
looked
great
deep
copper
with
ruby
highlights
under
a
persistent
creamy
tan
head
very
effervescent
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
with
some
pepper
spiciness
and
some
herbal
notes
the
spiciness
dominates
the
taste
probably
due
to
the
effervescence
it
is
really
biting
but
then
the
malt
takes
that
away
then
it
ends
very
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
i
would
like
it
more
if
it
was
a
little
thicker
this
seems
close
to
being
really
really
good
but
right
now
it
comes
through
as
just
a
fair
amount
of
various
tasty
things
still
quite
good
but
i
think
there
needs
to
be
greater
focus
on
something
to
give
this
dubbel
extra
character
surely
worth
a
try
or
two
750
ml
bottle
batch
52
mouthfeel
is
excellent
very
creamy
and
gritty
at
the
same
time
nice
touch
of
carbonation
at
the
end
this
beer
is
minorly
sweet
but
i
would
have
no
problem
finishing
this
myself
or
sharing
it
with
a
friend
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
out
of
it
from
some
chatter
i
had
heard
about
allagash
i
definitely
want
to
try
more
beers
by
them
and
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
even
though
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
it
up
again
in
the
near
future
cheers2beers
d
this
is
good
a
good
dubbel
but
this
is
no
westmalle
which
is
near
perfection
in
brewing
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
goes
down
easier
than
a
lot
of
dubbels
but
it
lacks
depth
id
love
to
try
it
as
a
saucemarinade
for
pork
though
drinkability
pretty
high
allagash
dubbel
pours
a
dark
brown
which
looks
like
ruby
throughout
when
holding
it
up
to
the
light
smell
is
fairly
disappointing
perhaps
it
was
too
cold
when
i
was
attempting
to
smell
it
taste
is
good
but
not
spectacular
for
a
belgian
style
ale
tastes
almost
like
a
brown
ale
definetely
worth
a
try
but
i
had
expected
more
an
easy
drinker
with
few
flaws
somewhat
on
the
boring
side
for
a
dubbel
but
this
is
certainly
worth
trying
again
and
again
i
might
cellar
a
few
to
see
what
other
flavors
develop
from
the
bottle
forgot
to
put
batch
number
down
but

it

the

came

and
a
small
amount
of

good
beer
drinkability
this
goes
down
decently
but
its
far
too
subtle
for
my
tastes
i
would
only
get
this
occaisionly
and
just
one
bottle
at
that
or
two
bottles
if
it
ever
came
in
12
oz
form
an
impressive
ale
there
is
a
nice
mixture
of
dark
roasted
flavors
as
well
as
erthy
and
spicy
notes
contributing
to
a
beer
that
is
overall
very
complex
yet
quite
smooth
and
quaffable
divine
thanks
mabz
for
this
one
good
alcohol
content
nice
beer
for
introducing
others
to
the
style
its
certainly
nothing
special
but
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
nonetheless
hazy
light
brown
with
a
thin
lame
head
that
does
manage
to
last
a
bit
smells
sweet
like
candied
caramel
sugary
frozen
mixed
berries
a
touch
of
earth
a
hint
of
nut
and
a
pinch
of
wood
come
into
play
too
watery
front
that
gets
a
little
better
as
it
warms
coffee
and
toffee
grow
in
the
flavor
aspect
of
things
too
abv
is
well
hidden
this
comes
across
as
sweet
and
light
not
strong
i
am
disappointed
but
utterly
this
does
not
compare
to
any
of
the
great
or
even
good
belgians
nice
attempt
but
lacking
body
and
complexity
i
want
more
more
nose
more
head
and
definitely
more
body
a
good
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
having
brought
it
all
the
way
home
it
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
minimal
head
it
smelled
mildly
of
berries
and
maybe
some
apple
the
taste
is
a
little
harsh
and
yeasty
up
front
but
finishes
very
nicely
and
sweetly
very
drinkable
this
is
not
the
greatest
attempt
at
a
belgian
dubbel
but
it
is
a
drinkable
and
economical
choice
for
session
drinking
its
a
good
lazy
sunday
afternoon
beer
cheers
the
flavor
is
sweet
sour
and
fruity
it
was
a
bit
surprising
at
first
taste
very
little
hop
flavor
but
there
are
good
amounts
of
sweet
malts
thrown
in
this
would
be
a
good
beer
with
bbqd
pork
or
grilled
chicken
bottle
courtesy
of
mynie
the
aroma
of
this
semihazy
brown
ale
is
surprisingly
malty
combined
with
brown
sugar
and
an
increasingly
roasty
aroma
flavors
of
yeast
and
fruit
appear
on
the
palate
swiftly
followed
by
malt
and
a
little
roastiness
that
lends
a
touch
of
astringency
but
the
big
feature
here
is
malt
on
the
palate
and
in
the
finish
too
this
beer
didnt
seem
as
typically
belgian
to
me
as
some
others
but
it
is
quite
good
nonetheless
d
enjoyable
not
too
strong
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
a
nice
dubbel
i
just
wish
that
the
odor
had
more
to
offer
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
smooth
with
a
mild
cocoa
powder
grittiness
that
doesnt
muddle
the
brew
i
liked
chimay
red
i
did
not
like
this
i
was
barely
able
to
finish
a
pint
of
it
overall
not
my
favorite
dubbel
but
still
an
excellent
selection
not
bad
more
drinkable
than
most
dubbels
but
not
quite
as
satisfying
either
still
recommended
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
it
has
a
very
well
rounded
flavor
there
is
a
bit
too
aggressive
of
a
roast
profile
in
the
flavor
for
my
taste
but
the
beer
still
remains
balanced
with
that
flavor
at
play
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
beer
again
drinkability
very
nice
im
setting
some
down
for
aging
in
the
cellar
but
mostly
for
ease
of
enjoyment
and
sharing
in
the
near
term
other
than
the
one
negative
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
no
alcohol
flavor
light
to
medium
body
and
clean
with
a
nice
bite
of
carbonation
no
problems
drinking
this
one
at
all
batch
52pours
a
cloudy
deep
mahogany
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
thick
beige
head
that
retains
well
the
aroma
is
striking
with
big
dark
fruit
notes
jumping
out
of
the
chalice
fig
prune
grape
cherry
and
blackberry
as
well
as
dark
candy
sugar
some
light
spices
corriander
clove
light
floral
and
herbal
hops
tobacco
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
flavor
starts
out
with
some
dark
fruits
fig
grape
cherry
followed
by
some
spices
corriander
clove
anise
some
chocolate
tobacco
candy
sugar
herbal
and
floral
hops
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
light
with
prickly
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
an
enjoyable
dubbel
american
or
not
definately
a
step
up
from
the
double
ale
nicely
done
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
goblet
murky
russet
brown
with
a
fizzy
sandcolored
cap
aromas
are
of
typical
belgian
yeasty
esters
tart
apples
green
grapes
etc
with
a
brown
sugarmaple
sweet
baked
goods
scent
dark
dried
fruits
come
through
in
the
taste
figs
and
dates
primarily
there
is
an
easygoing
vinous
quality
to
the
flavor
of
this
beer
somewhat
of
a
mineral
aspect
to
the
finish
as
well
barely
a
trace
of
some
sort
of
grassyspicy
hop
medium
body
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
just
a
bit
effervescent
not
so
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
pretty
nice
as
far
as
im
concerned
allagash
has
much
better
beers
out
there
and
there
are
also
much
better
examples
of
an
american
version
of
a
belgian
double
the
only
saving
grace
of
this
beer
imo
is
that
it
was
only
5
50
it
was
drinkable
for
the
price
and
i
managed
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
be
purchasing
it
again
perhaps
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
good
brown
appearance
with
decent
sized
head
and
a
little
lacing
good
dubbel
head
fruity
with
a
little
alcohol
some
yeastiness
the
taste
is
a
little
lacking
simliar
taste
to
a
good
dubbel
but
its
lacking
some
of
the
in
your
face
attitude
that
the
belgians
have
give
this
one
a
try
but
dont
expect
it
to
kick
the
shit
out
of
your
favorite
dubbel
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
but
it
seems
a
little
bit
different
from
dubbels
ive
had
in
the
past
maybe
my
palate
is
becoming
more
discernable
but
this
beer
didnt
taste
quite
as
foreign
and
esoteric
as
most
authentic
belgians
but
rather
it
seemed
like
a
good
american
ale
with
dubbel
characteristics
drinkability
the
sharpness
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
and
combined
with
the
taste
i
dont
think
i
want
to
drink
this
again
let
alone
more
than
once
in
a
sitting
d
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
has
been
mishandled
or
if
it
is
just
sort
of
bla
i
dont
taste
any
of
the
complexity
that
i
would
hope
for
in
this
style
the
bitterness
at
the
finish
might
be
hops
or
it
might
be
an
off
flavor
i
will
give
this
beer
another
shot
but
im
just
not
impressed
this
dubbel
is
mahogany
in
colour
with
a
minimal
head
and
no
lace
it
has
super
fast
little
carbonation
bubbles
the
nose
holds
spice
and
a
rich
malted
aroma
smells
somewhat
vinous
and
dark
fruit
charactered
with
yeast
inflections
the
flavour
is
that
of
a
dominant
malt
base
with
spicery
and
vinous
impressions
yeasty
tones
as
if
bottle
refermented
mouthfeel
is
not
overly
robust
and
tips
in
at
the
fat
end
of
lightness
approaching
medium
drinkability
is
good
as
this
is
quite
the
mild
little
creation
finish
is
super
clean
as
the
label
proclaims
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
designate
it
as
sessionable
if
one
were
to
see
fit
as
an
admirer
of
the
style
quite
pleasant
nothing
mind
blowing
at
all
but
solid
first
allagash
for
me
not
the
last
you
may
not
be
overwhelmed
but
youll
want
another
and
another
and
another
which
is
what
really
matters
overall
this
one
seemed
very
promising
to
me
but
let
me
down
its
not
bad
but
i
just
think
there
are
a
bunch
out
there
that
are
better
i
wish
i
was
drinking
the
tripel
right
now
d
the
ale
leaves
a
warm
impression
on
the
drinker
with
enough
characteristics
to
make
drinking
another
worthwhile
and
an
enjoyment
of
drinking
that
makes
it
easy
to
do
so
would
like
to
try
this
after
being
aged
will
most
certainly
buy
this
again
musings
for
the
uninitiated
go
to
ommegang
for
a
better
offering
in
an
american
belgianstyle
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
one
of
these
bottles
every
day
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
mild
body
i
would
have
liked
more
flavor
overall
the
acidic
aftertaste
washes
most
remnants
of
flavor
away
although
very
easy
to
drink
no
strong
phenol
tastes
it
needs
more
to
make
it
better
tell
that
to
the
bean
counters
a
classic
belgian
dubbel
yet
it¬ís
from
maine
a
really
perfect
example
of
a
dubbel
rich
flavorful
my
kind
of
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
beautifully
presented
in
a
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
the
allagash
dubbel
reserve
pours
into
a
chalice
light
brown
with
nice
ruby
highlights
a
very
thin
white
head
forms
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
pronounced
belgian
spiciness
theres
also
some
sweet
overripe
fruit
in
the
background
the
taste
begins
with
the
spiciness
and
a
fruity
sweetness
enters
quickly
a
nuttiness
seems
to
be
hiding
in
the
finish
all
this
is
supported
by
a
very
strong
and
interesting
malt
base
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
it
finishes
a
bit
watery
and
thin
the
drinkability
is
great
the
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
and
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
smoothly
i
had
no
problem
killing
the
750
ml
bottle
by
myself
on
a
snowy
friday
night
this
dubbel
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
cant
help
thinking
something
is
missing
there
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
anything
that
separates
it
from
other
very
good
dubbels
elevating
it
to
truly
great
status
pours
a
mediumbrown
color
with
a
thick
tan
colored
head
that
has
staying
power
and
leaves
behind
some
lacing
faint
aromas
of
dried
fruit
grapes
honey
and
bread
seem
to
come
out
somewhat
expected
for
this
style
but
interesting
nonetheless
the
taste
is
great
with
a
fruity
sweetness
paired
with
a
hop
profile
that
fluctuates
as
the
beer
warms
a
variety
of
flavors
dance
across
my
tongue
and
leave
behind
a
sweet
coating
that
is
really
very
nice
the
aftertaste
develops
into
a
rather
sour
flavor
in
the
back
of
my
throat
hence
a
deduction
in
points
for
mouthfeel
i
think
this
would
be
alleviated
by
aging
the
drinkability
is
good
for
this
beer
despite
its
high
abv
because
of
its
distinct
flavor
spectrum
and
its
complex
texture
a
totally
drinkable
brew
definitely
wanted
another
one
of
these
as
soon
as
i
was
done
a
lighter
dubbel
in
terms
of
body
and
abv
a
decent
brew
with
some
interesting
flavor
compliments
but
nothing
that
floored
me
drinkability
is
great
a
very
welldone
beer
on
par
with
the
true
belgians
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
highly
recommend
very
cloudy
mix
of
dark
reds
browns
yellows
and
oranges
much
darker
than
i
expected
smell
is
pretty
mild
maybe
some
pine
taste
is
exceptional
the
best
balanced
beer
i
have
tried
malty
fruitycherries
plums
sweet
earthy
rich
complex
and
smooth
feels
good
in
mouth
beer
has
some
hidden
kick
very
drinkable
very
solid
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
very
inviting
the
taste
is
possibly
like
canteloupe
or
some
other
weird
fruit
i
got
this
beer
in
a
trade
with
wcudwight
for
a
higher
alcohol
beer
this
one
is
par
i
would
probably
try
other
high
alcohol
beers
before
coming
back
to
this
one
but
i
certainly
would
not
turn
it
down
an
average
beer
a
drinkable
beer
it¬í
goes
down
easy
so
it¬ís
good
drinker
but
maybe
someone
who
likes
it
a
bit
more
would
find
that
to
matter
more
to
them
pours
a
hazy
brownishamber
color
with
plenty
of
offwhite
colored
head
the
head
lasted
right
down
to
the
last
sip
smells
of
malt
and
banana
subtle
tastes
of
banana
and
caramel
quite
surprisingly
smooth
for
a
7
abv
with
only
a
hint
of
boozyness
at
the
end
of
a
sip
which
increases
as
the
beer
warms
overall
this
beer
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
well
worth
giving
a
try
taste
mid
carbonation
caramel
malt
but
that
aged
cork
taste
took
a
little
too
much
space
id
have
to
give
this
one
another
shot
with
a
fresh
sample
in
order
to
enjoy
its
subtleties
wow
strong
performance
by
allagash
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
their
stuff
in
the
fairly
near
future
all
in
all
this
is
ok
for
the
type
of
beer
it
isits
not
my
favorite
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
coating
a
meaty
medium
and
very
creamy
a
nice
dubbel
much
better
than
i
remember
it
750

on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
finger
of
beige
head
that
subsides
to
a
lingering
spotty

quite
peppery
with
some
brown
sugary
sweetness
and
a
slightly
vinous
note
taste
was
a
very
nice
dark
earthy
malt
with
hints
of
slighty
roasted
coffee
figs
berries
and
brown
sugar
upfront
these
give
way
to
a
big
yeasty
center
and
a
nicely
spiced
finish
and
a
bit
of
surpising
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
an
excellent
carbonation
that
cleanses
your
palate
after
each
sip
i
really
liked
this
beernot
quite
as
complex
as
some
dubbels
but
does
have
nice
flavors
and
is
a
really
easy
drinker
a
disappointing
boring
and
forgettable
beer
i
wont
be
having
it
again
very
drinakble
and
enjoyable
the
flavors
are
balanced
and
blend
well
and
the
alcohol
although
noticable
far
from
inhibits
drinking
more
than
one
glass
decent
dubble
malty
is
right
the
malts
really
stick
out
on
your
palate
a
sweet
character
comes
through
also
the
finish
is
remarkably
smooth
though
picking
up
on
the
higher
alcohol
level
but
it
is
not
overpowering
a
nice
dubbel
served
in
a
750ml
bottle
with
cork
poured
a
dark
rich
brown
into
the
glass
with
a
thick
creamy
head
sweet
smelling
with
caramel
and
chocolate
aromas
flavour
is
much
of
the
same
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
and
earthiness
a
very
good
full
rich
tasting
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
average
on
this
one
taste
again
reminds
me
of
wine
with
some
malty
and
coffee
flavors
hidden
in
there
mouthfeel
is
chewy
full
bubbly
pretty
drinkable
but
could
be
too
sweet
after
a
while
a
good
dubbel
not
my
favorite
ever
but
a
good
brew
drinkability
id
definately
have
this
again
this
would
make
a
great
beer
to
start
off
somebody
on
belgians
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
attempt
at
a
style
that
is
hard
to
nail
down
well
pours
a
dark
brown
mud
color
unresponsive
to
light
capped
by
a
thin
offwhite
loose
head
and
somewhat
light
and
foofy
despite
its
darkness
aroma
is
typical
dubbel
evoking
candi
sugars
and
tart
berry
notes
on
the
fresher
side
with
the
slightest
hop
tinge
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
silky
without
diacetyl
malty
sweetness
is
bullied
by
bitter
dark
fruits
like
fig
and
prune
a
bit
too
obtuse
for
me
more
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
ala
creation
than
a
true
dubbel
licorice
and
clove
tap
you
on
the
shoulder
the
flavor
albeit
large
balances
nicely
with
the
lightness
of
body
fresh
cut
grass
and
slight
roasted
chestnut
and
charred
wood
hints
in
the
end
one
of
the
better
american
belgians
but
i
think
it
will
age
well
and
mellow
the
extreme
hilos
see
venoms
review
pours
a
nice
solid
murky
brown
color
with
a
3
finger
head
that
falls
slowly
to
a
solid
coating
over
top
leaving
some
big
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
nice
and
spicey
i
get
a
good
brown
sugar
sweetness
underlying
the
spiceyness
i
like
it
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
base
of
brown
sugaryness
overlayed
with
yeasty
spiceyness
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
i
like
the
interplay
of
the
flavor
and
the
feelcarbonation
overall
a
very
nice
brew
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
the
nose
or
flavor
i
like
hte
flavor
and
the
feel
nothing
to
knock
in
this
one
this
would
be
divine
with
freshly
churned
vanilla
ice
cream
if
it
was
a
blind
taste
test
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
tell
this
is
from
maine
instead
of
brussels
yes
keep
up
the
good
work
this
coming
from
someone
that
generally
prefers
dubbels
to
tripels
silky
looking
foam
head
and
deap
dark
body
aromas
are
sweet
and
caramel
like
with
biscuit
aroma
the
taste
is
good
but
looses
something
from
the
smell
the
beer
is
full
flavored
and
deceivingly
light
almost
to
light
their
is
a
distinct
latte
flavor
and
a
ever
so
slight
mineralmetalic
finish
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
belgian
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
reserve
bottle
not
bad
at
all
very
complex
poured
into
a
goblet
it
had
a
light
brown
color
with
a
small
to
medium
head
good
retention
not
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
great
malty
aroma
very
sweet
tons
of
caramel
and
maybe
some
roasted
malts
as
well
the
balance
weighs
heavily
towards
the
malts
some
hints
of
coffee
upon
tasting
but
sticking
strongly
to
the
caramel
malts
no
complaints
about
the
mouthfeel
or
drinkability
this
was
an
excellent
pairing
with
a
spaghetti
with
beef
and
mushroom
sauce
that
i
made
the
scent
and
initial
taste
of
malts
hits
you
hard
it
has
a
wonderful
malty
chocolate
smell
and
a
great
taste
to
follow
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
traces
throughout
the
whole
drinking
experience
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
which
resembles
the
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
you
taste
with
every
sip
there
is
a
very
slight
hoppyness
the
alcohol
level
although
high
never
effects
the
taste
excellent
dubbel
especially
for
an
american
brewery

is
one
of
the
better
american
efforts
that
i¬íve
had
of
the
style
it
lacked
complexity
for
sure
like
a
lot
of
the
other
reviews
pointed
out
but
overall
it
was
far
superior
to
some
of
the
halfwitted
hoppy
efforts
that
i¬íve
had
the
displeasure
of
trying
from
the
us
over
the
years
allagash
can
be
proud
of
this
one
this
beer
was
a
little
disappointing
after
have
some
of
the
other
allagash
line
it
smelled
really
good
and
looked
really
good
but
as
i
took
a
taste
of
it
it
was
just
bland
not
what
i
though
it
was
going
to
be
maybe
i
just
had
my
hopes
too
high
i
might
just
try
another
4
pack
just
to
see
if
maybe
like
i
said
before
my
hopes
were
too
high
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
so
far
i
have
not
been
disappointed
with
any
beer
ive
tasted
from
allagash
this
beer
is
excellent
all
around
i
particularly
like
the
strong
malt
presentation
that
develops
good
but
very
light
supporting
flavors
this
beer
is
not
overdone
with
distracting
flavors
but
it
is
simple
yet
complex
and
tasty
pours

a

classic
belgian
style
bottle
with
the
cork
and
cage
pours
a
nice
and
cloudy
brown
with
a
nice
head
leaving
lots
of
lace
the
smell
is
spicy
and
earthy
from
the
bottle
conditioning
very
smooth

not
a
lot
of
the

warmness
lots
of
crystal

biscuit
flavor
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
usually
the
bottle
conditioned
belgians
have
more
of
a
carbonation
tingle
this
is
a
great
belgian
style
beer
made
in
america
how
wonderful
dn
i
may
have
to
use
another
review
for
this
one
as
it
stands
this
is
a
subpar
beer
that
seems
overhyped
poured
a
red
brown
with
a
clumpy
head
the
nose
seemed
to
be
understated
which
ties
in
with
the
taste
the
old
fruit
lfavours
were
there
but
i
felt
the
midbody
was
a
little
thin
for
the
style
yes
it
was
very
smooth
but
i
kept
wanting
more
flavour
not
the
best
i
have
tasted
from
these
guys
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brownish
red
with
a
short
off
white
head
that
lasts
pretty
well
smells
of
raisins
and
plums
bubblegummy
spices
sweet
tastes
of
prunes
and
figs
surprisingly
close
to
medium
bodied
thought
it
would
be
heavier
light
carbonation
gives
it
a
very
smooth
and
pleasant
feel
good
carbonation
and
a
thick
body
you
must
sip
this
one
gulping
it
wouldnt
be
just
difficult
but
it
would
do
it
a
disservice
it
is
enjoyed
in
little
sips
awesome
beer
this
is
a
really
good
dubbel
but
i
can¬ít
help
feeling
it
is
too
clean
and
thus
too
americanized
it
is
on
par
with
new
belgium
abbey
maybe
a
tickle
better
both
are
sold
at
damn
good
prices
i
got
my
750ml
for
4
50
in
milwaukee
wi
if
i
see
this
beer
again
i
will
buy
it
good
stuff
worth
a
try¬Ö
but
i
enjoyed
the
allagash
tripel
reserve
much
more
slight
head
on
the
pour
reddish
brown
in
color
kind
of
like
a
garnet
when
held
to
the
light
the
aroma
was
yeasty
with
dried
fruit
the
flavor
was
very
rich
malts
notes
of
cherries
and
raisins
came
through
in
the
flavor
the
finish
was
fairly
dry
the
alcohol
was
at
first
not
particularly
noticeable
but
as
i
went
through
the
bottle
the
alcohol
became
more
pronounced
a
decent
enough
dubbel
still
prefer
tripels
for
a
night
with
a
find
beer
but
not
something
i
would
pick
over
a
tripel
any
day
drinkability
delicious
not
a
show
stopper
but
a
fine
sessional
dubbel
served
in
a
chalice
poured
a
nuttybrown
color
with
very
little
head
fairly
unpleasant
odor
not
sure
how
to
best
describe
the
flavor
unfortunately
the
best
word
i
can
come
up
with
is
fishy
overpowering
unpleasant
malt
flavor
with
a
bitter
skunked
aftertaste
i
have
so
wanted
to
like
allagash
beers
i
love
belgians
and
i
live
in
new
england
perfect
combo
but
after
trying
this
and
the
the
summer
ale
ive
been
very
disappointed
bottle
poured
a
deep
brownblack
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
excellent
retention
aroma
is
comprised
of
slightly
roasted
malt
light
funky
yeast
and
exotic
spices
warm
alcohol
taste
with
subtle
cherryfigs
with
full
body
and
light
carbonation
wow
i
didn¬ít
expect
this
to
be
this
good
probably
better
then
most
original
belgian
dubbel
murky
looking
iced
tea
with
a
light
tan
fluffy
cap
scattered
webs
of
light
lacing
the
nose
had
light
fruitiness
with
a
big
sweetness
caramel
and
sugars
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
back
this
seems
to
become
more
of
a
sweet
bomb
as
it
warmed
sugary
sweetness
upfront
with
some
dark
fruits
coming
in
on
the
back
of
the
taste
a
light
dusting
of
spices
a
tad
overly
sweet
in
my
opinion
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
lighter
body
drinkability
would
be
helped
by
the
sweetness
being
a
bit
more
balanced
but
overall
not
bad
solid
brew
but
the
sweetness
becomes
cloying
towards
the
end
i
found
this
beer
to
have
the
typical
blend
of
malts
and
spices
for
a
belgian
style
dubbel
but
the
flavor
was
well
balanced
and
smooth
the
spices
and
alcohol
did
not
dominate
as
in
other
dubbel
style
beers
ive
had
wow
this
was
pretty
damn
good
really
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
american
examples
of
this
style
and
well
worth
picking
up
this
allagash
tastes
of
darker
malts
with
a
rumraisin
flavor
i
cant
detect
much
hops
it
feels
medium
bodied
at
7
6
there
is
not
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
taste
wise
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
one
even
more
as
it
warmed
up
a
bit
12
oz
stubbie
bottle
this
is
not
the
abbey
dubble
of
the
750
this
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
off
white
head
aroma
is
of
rich
coffee
and
roasted
malts
taste
is
of
caramel
and
coffee
there
is
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
finish
as
well
no
hops
so
to
speak
this
seems
more
like
a
porter
gone
belgian
than
a
dubble
as
the
style
says
light
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
once
again
not
my
style
could
not
have
more
than
one
please
do
not
confuse
this
one
with
the
750
different
animal
all
together
pours
a
slightly
rich
brown
with
a
reddish
tinge
good
head
and
retention
smell
is
fruit
cherry
plum
malt
hops
and
dark
chocolate
taste
is
malt
hops
dark
chocolate
fruit
a
hint
of
spice
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
a
bit
rougher
than
expected
effervescent
all
over
the
mouth
drinkability
is
good
but
noticeable
abv
keeps
the
score
down
a
bit
after
tasting
curieux
and
four
i
expected
much
better
from
allagash
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
topped
with
an
immense
light
tan
head
that
lingers
quite
a
while
and
laces
nicely
a
potent
smell
punctuated
by
nosepunching
malty
and
medicinal
notes
as
well
as
yeast
taste
is
only
marginally
less
boldeminently
smooth
with
malts
complemented
by
a
winelike
astringent
taste
enjoyed
this
with
roast
pork
and
potatoes
and
they
played
pretty
well
together
next
time
ill
have
to
try
this
one
alone
it
is
worth
revisiting
john
many
thanks
to
brewguru
for
the
offering
d
nah
wouldnt
pick
this
one
up
again
i
will
sample
again
and
compare
results
one
of
a
few
dubbels
i
enjoyed
this
evening
and
another
great
example
allagash
can
nail
the
belgian
styles
like
very
few
breweries
in
north
america
can
this
is
the
third
beer
of
theirs
ive
had
and
i
must
say
i
feel
spoiled
to
have
tried
these
this
beer
is
an
absolute
luxury
and
one
i
will
be
getting
much
more
of
very
soon
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
which
i
will
try
again
and
soon
i
hope
i
can
find
more
complexity
as
in
the
other
allagash
reserve
beers
large
bottle
caged
and
corked
i
cannot
believe
the
low
review
numbers
for
this
brew
it
pours
a
dark
murky
and
mysterious
shade
of
darker
brown
head
is
tan
pillowy
then
a
18
inch
of
foam
and
it
leaves
very
nice
lacing
with
some
sheets
of
lace
as
well
nose
is
raisins
yeast
rum
alcohol
varnishhorse
blanket
this
is
a
smooth
as
silk
big
large
complextasty
buttery
double
that
is
pure
taste
refinement
and
pleasue
on
the
tongue
notes
of
rum
soaked
raisins
vanilla
cookie
dough
spices
cininimon
toast
yeeha
this
stuff
is
tasty
go
get
some
now
poured
from
the
big
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
was
deep
brown
with
just
a
touch
of
ruby
highlights
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
topped
the
glass
and
left
clingy
shafts
of
lace
as
the
head
settled
back
into
the
beer
the
aroma
has
subtle
roast
malts
sweet
malt
aromas
of
figs
and
ribbon
candy
followed
by
just
a
hint
of
spice
the
flavor
delivers
the
sweet
malt
character
first
followed
quickly
by
subtle
hop
fruitiness
the
spice
i
caught
on
the
nose
is
just
barely
there
a
bit
of
tanginess
shows
on
the
finish
a
good
rich
mouth
feel
with
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
feel
leads
to
a
good
drinkability
i
am
starting
to
sense
a
pattern
with
these
corked
and
cage
bottles
that
i
have
been
buying
lately
they
all
have
a
delicious
woodyearthy
flavor
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
sizable
light
tan
head
an
ok
beer
if
not
overly
flavorful
ok
malty
flavor
with
some
muted
hops
i
bought
this
bottle
which
was
probably
2
years
old
but
it
didnt
have
any
ill
effects
on
the
beer
it
just
happened
that
my
friend
and
i
went
to
beer
heaven
and
grabbed
a
4pack
of
this
unaware
the
actual
brewmaster
and
owner
of
allagash
was
standing
right
behind
us
and
said
nice
choice
thats
my
beer
i
thought
the
guy
was
blowing
smoke
up
my
ass
but
he
handed
my
friend
his
business
card
and
thanked
us
for
supporting
him
so
needless
to
say
that
was
pretty
cool
now
on
the
other
hand
this
beer
is
not
so
cool
i
love
allagash
products
and
was
shocked
by
this
brew
the
appearance
isnt
terrible
it
was
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
red
glow
in
the
light
the
head
was
pretty
small
but
held
on
for
a
little
bit
the
aroma
was
semisweet
with
malt
and
sugar
hints
the
taste
was
suprisingly
off
it
was
beyond
what
i
consider
to
be
dry
my
mouth
immediately
began
to
search
for
any
remaining
saliva
to
prevent
total
loss
of
all
taste
the
alcohol
was
very
evident
and
came
on
strong
along
with
the
dryness
now
let
me
clarify
dryness
is
not
always
a
bad
factor
but
this
was
just
not
a
favorable
presence
in
order
to
finish
it
i
will
have
to
struggle
still
have
love
for
allagash
though
i
was
being
too
nice
to
this
beer
because
i
love
so
many
of
allagashs
other
offerings
this
stinks
it
tastes
like
a
liquid
tootsie
roll
i
actually
poured
most
of
this
out
which
is
rare
for
me
i
would
be
doing
a
disservice
to
bas
who
might
read
this
to
give
this
anything
higher
than
a
3
0
pour
out
a
wonderful
deep
brown
with
a
huge
offwhitetan
headskie
tastes
sharp
and
floral
with
some
lingering
sweetness
a
decent
dubbel
but
not
up
to
snuff
with
the
imports
certainly
worth
checking
out
check
it
out
allagash
did
a
good
job
ok
i
read
the
other
reviews
and
realized
that
i
while
i
did
get
cherry
i
did
not
get
toffee
carry
on
a
very
good
dubbel
in
my
limited
experience
with
the
style
very
enjoyable
many
thanks
to
afatty
for
sharing
this
beer
with
me
theres
a
spritzy
carbonation
mouthfeel
that
i
didnt
lovebut
i
felt
that
it
lightened
the
brew
significantly
taking
the
burden
off
the
malts
and
the
booze
nice
brew
that
id
buy
again

dark

the

to
create
all
kinds

fruitiness
ranging
from
grape

currant
to
plum
and
passionfruit
and
finishing
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
like

theres
more
dubbel
characteristics
like

in

than
the
taste
a
good

its

unique

a
deeply
reddish

head
faded
to
a
layer
of
bubbles
rather
quickly
and
lacing
was
average
aroma
is
of
yeasty
cherries
it
seems
taste
is
lightly
of
belgianstyle
malts
followed
with
the
slightly
sour
fruitcherry
motif
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
for
a
dubbel
although
i
wish
it
was
just
a
bit
more
chewy
its
kind
of
thin
seemingly
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
do
these
folks
make
a
bad
beer
this
went
great
with
steak
and
shrimp
tonight
tangy
smooth
not
too
sweet
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
dubbels
ive
had
similar
to
thier
other
beers
and
excellent
as
always
ive
enjoyed
every
allagash
beer
ive
had
and
im
very
grateful
that
they
send
em
way
down
here
i
nice
enjoyable
ale
pours
a
deep
amber
color
there
was
a
minimal
head
but
this
did
not
distract
for
the
enjoyment
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
mixture
of
the
the
hops
and
malt
to
be
encountered
the
taste
is
good
a
malts
and
hops
nicely
mixed
neither
one
outweighing
the
other
pleasant
mouthfeel
definitely
worth
giving
a
try
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
i
am
guessing
due
to
the
aging
is
nearly
perfect
just
a
hint
of
spiciness
on
the
palate
leaves
this
fairly
dry
and
wonderfully
smooth
not
too
thin
but
not
syrupy
oh
so
nice
flavors
dont
assault
the
senses
with
complexity
but
it
is
rather
well
balanced
nice
malty
profile
that
leads
to
a
bittersweet
belgiancandylike
finish
alcohol
hides
itself
well
this
is
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
on
the
porch
when
its
about
60
degrees
in
october
looking
forward
to
a
comparison
against
a
fresh
version
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
half
a
finger
of
head
that
dies
away
quickly
no
lacing
left
on
this
one
the
smell
is
rich
and
malty
lots
of
sugary
sweetness
brown
sugar
honey
and
caramel
all
mix
together
for
a
great
aroma
a
hint
of
hops
in
there
too
the
taste
is
also
fairly
malty
and
sweet
some
molasses
and
toffee
flavors
in
there
under
the
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
light
the
drinkability
is
really
good
for
a
7
6
brew
another
nice
offering
from
allagash
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
an
opaque
brown
color
there
was
some
tan
head
but
it
dissapated
quickly
the
aroma
is
sweet
mainly
caramel
malt
possibly
a
hint
of
cherries
down
in
there
there
is
definitely
a
hint
of
fruit
somewhat
yeasty
too
the
taste
isn¬ít
as
good
as
the
nose
sweet
yet
a
bit
thin
in
body
caramel
fruits
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
to
the
taste
good
but
i
think
it
should
be
a
little
more
full
bodied
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
i
was
not
disappointed
it
was
a
nice
dark
amber
color
and
the
nose
was
a
lovely
blend
of
hops
and
complex
malts
almost
a
layered
scent
it
was
only
slightly
bitter
with
hints
of
roastiness
is
that
even
a
word
and
some
dark
flavorings
definitely
one
i
would
not
mind
having
again
perfect
for
sitting
and
sipping
while
watching
a
good
sports
show
on
the
tube
it
gave
me
a
nice
warm
feeling
not
so
impressed
by
this
one
maybe
the
fact
that
my
first
dubbel
was
a
westmalle
will
prevent
me
from
being
satisfied
with
anything
else
this
is
an
average
beer
but
nothing
that
i
enjoyed
much
i
could
gorge
on
many
of
these
fine
brews
from
the
wonderful
state
of
maine
while
this
is
certainly
a
high
quality
brew
i
expect
more
out
of
my
dubbels
this
was
unique
and
very
enjoyable
but
i
wanted
more
malt
body
and
a
bit
more
complexity
this
was
very
onedimensional
but
enjoyable
for
what
its
worth
a
big
thanks
to
noclueaboutbeer
for
hauling
this
one
out
to
kansas
all
the
way
from
connecticut
yea
i
liked
it
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
to
cherry
color
with
a
nice
thick
offwhite
head
which
settles
down
to
about
a
14
inch
head
sustaining
through
the
session
very
appealing
smell
that
wafts
of
a
bittersweet
scent
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
what
i
have
tasted
from
arrogant
bastard
which
was
surprising
i
love
the
mouthfeel
with
a
definite
sense
of
thickness
or
depth
i
like
the
brew
but
this
750ml
is
enough
for
me
a
fairly
average
dubbel
quite
dark
in
appearance
mushy
lemons
and
tart
creamy
aromas
a
bit
yeasty
flavor
is
similarly
musty
but
loaded
with
cookie
and
molasses
malt
flavors
along
with
some
ripe
fruits
alcohol
blends
well
but
you
can
tell
theres
some
booze
in
this
brew
the
label
notes
how
much
rather
how
many
varieties
of
malt
was
used
in
this
beer
and
you
can
tell
its
got
some
nice
complexity
to
it
and
theres
not
much
in
the
way
of
aftertaste
or
any
astringency
but
the
end
result
is
a
little
bland
especially
considering
what
the
style
can
be
no
one
thing
jumps
out
here
but
it
all
comes
together
smoothly
and
cleanly
the
slight
ashy
impression
is
the
sole
offnote
even
thats
minimal
its
very
basic
with
a
simple
straightforward
balance
the
solid
abv
gives
some
real
warmth
to
the
overall
picture
its
kind
of
a
wysiwyg
thing
delivering
at
face
value
and
that
makes
it
drinkable
but
id
likely
put
the
brakes
on
after
one
or
two
of
these
and
so
i
like
it
just
fine
and
certainly
enough
to
believe
that
if
it
has
maine
on
it
it
has
good
in
it
drinkability
i
loved
this
dubbel
i
will
go
back
for
more
poured
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
little
head
on
it
smell
consisted
of
some
spices
and
some
fruity
tones
taste
was
a
little
complex
at
first
some
brown
sugar
kicks
in
then
mixes
with
some
fruit
theres
some
chocolate
undertones
towards
the
end
once
this
beer
warms
up
the
spices
start
to
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
its
not
very
overwhelming
abv
is
very
well
hidden
granted
there
are
better
dubbels
on
the
market
but
this
could
do
it
is
a
lovely
rubybrown
in
color
the
aroma
smells
of
raisins
and
biscuit
malt
the
taste
is
almost
a
burnt
bitterness
and
is
slightly
spicy
it
should
be
sweeter
and
the
burnt
taste
is
a
turn
off
on
this
particular
style
nor
is
it
a
terribly
complex
beer
taste
great
mouthfeel
it
has
a
nice
aftertaste
which
doesent
linger
in
the
mouth
too
long
a
little
bitter
but
very
well
balanced
a
drinkable
ale
but
not
terribly
complex
ester
reminding
me
of
wheat
beer
but
much
more
malty
and
sweet
bit
of
fruity
hops
small
offwhite
head
atop
cloudy
medium
brown
beer
soft
carb
medheavy
body
silky
sweet
and
malty
bit
of
molasses
nutty
sweet
finish
and
after
tinge
of
sourbitter
yeasty
pretty
good
with
complex
profile
like
a
dark
wheatbock
mix
still
has
some
rough
edges
to
work
out
a
medium
bodied
nicely
warming
beer
but
not
up
to
an
abbey
dubbel
standard
in
its
25
4
oz
bottle
with
a
cork
and
wire
hood
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
slightly
burnt
chocolate
taste
is
very
thin
i
keep
looking
for
something
to
happen
with
each
swallow
but
nothing
doing
certainly
very
inexpensive
but
with
more
flavorful
offerings
from
ommegang
and
unibroue
available
ill
spend
up
for
the
taste
allagash
wit
and
summer
ale
seem
to
be
the
ones
that
are
winners
for
me
ill
keep
trying
this
brewerys
offerings
but
for
now
i
think
ill
take
a
ommegang
if
im
drinking
belgian
on
a
budget
big
pop
when
removing
cork
very
dark
mahogany
brown
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
huge
foamy
light
tan
head
that
recedes
quite
slowly
the
head
eventually
becomes
a
thick
bumpy
lace
¬ñ
thick
in
spots
and
thin
in
others
with
lots
holding
on
around
the
edges
some
carbonation
rising
from
the
sides
of
the
glass
nice
spicy
aroma
with
a
tiny
hint
of
citrus
good
mouthfeel
not
overly
full
maybe
a
bit
on
the
light
side
yet
it
still
goes
down
remarkably
well
nice
spicy
brew
yet
there¬ís
also
a
good
distinctive
malt
start
that
is
bready
and
a
bit
yeasty
becomes
smoother
when
additional
yeast
is
poured
in
from
the
bottle
spices
come
in
along
with
a
prickly
carbonation
towards
mid
swallow
and
last
through
the
finish
the
malt
is
sweet
but
is
never
overly
so
or
cloying
the
sweetness
peaks
through
again
in
the
aftertaste
not
surprisingly
this
is
yet
another
superb
brew
from
the
fine
folks
at
allagash
oelergud
pours
a
maroon
color
with
golden
highlights
medium
head
fades
fast
but
nice
lace
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
suspended
in
thick
potion
aroma
has
prunes
raisins
hint
of
chocolate
and
maybe
cassis
taste
was
very
piney
and
yeasty
reminded
somewhat
of
this
anchor
steam
xmas
secondary
tastes
were
some
and
a
lactose
type
taste
in
the
back
end
followed
by
a
short
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
very
lively
but
somewhat
shortlived
good
sipping
beer
poured
from
a
caged
and
corked
750
ml
bottle
its
an
eyepleasing
brown
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
a
bit
after
a
few
minutes
the
smell
is
bits
of
spice
malty
sweetness
and
traces
of
orange
this
is
not
the
most
complex
tasting
dubbel
in
the
world
despite
that
its
a
great
tasting
dubbel
thats
eminently
drinkable
rubylike

with
a

a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
like
the
fact
that
its
on
the
lower
end
of
the
scale
for
a
belgian
double
this
was
my
first
allagash
productvery
nice
indeed
i
could
see
going
thru
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
all
around
wonderful
for
sure
i
got
the
end
of
the
bottle
so
it
poured
out
cloudy
with
the
yeast
the
head
was
big
and
foamy
and
receded
although
it
left
little
lace
the
smell
is
a
bit
fruity
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
spice
with
a
raw
malty
and
yeasty
subtone
the
flavor
is
a
mildly
burnt
earthy
flavor
with
the
fruitiness
still
there
and
subtle
hints
of
malt
and
hops
that
bite
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
aftertaste
is
again
the
burnt
woodsy
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
full
of
sharp
carbonation
bubbles
and
the
bite
at
the
back
of
the
throat
quite
balanced
and
drinkable
all
together
second
pour
and
probably
warming
improved
the
flavor
considerably
a
bit
of
clove
and
nut
flavor
appeared
but
still
i
feel
this
could
do
better
against
other
american
belgianstyle
ales
a
little
too
boring
and
thin
pours
a
deep
brown
with
some
reddish
tints
with
a
light
head
that
is
gone
in
a
flash
the
aroma
really
sweet
and
slightly
nutty
with
some
alcohol
notes
taste
is
is
sweet
with
some
roasted
nut
flavors
with
a
light
hooy
note
not
in
the
background
a
really
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
i
have
to
saya
decent
brew
for
the
style
but
there
are
better
for
sure
out
there
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
belgian
style
dark
ale
with
a
complex
mostly
malt
profile
with
a
pleasant
punch
of
sweet
dried
apricots
and
enough
hops
to
bitter
it
out
just
about
right
excellent
pairing
for
a
sharp
cheddar
or
quality
blue
cheese
not
an
everyday
ale
but
one
that
i
would
love
to
keep
on
hand
in
the
cellar
i
bet
these
will
be
even
better
at
2
5
to
3
years
from
the
bottling
date
yummy
very
portsherry
like
character
spicy
with
notes
of
allspice
cinnamon
the
middle
is
big
round
and
fruity
with
hints
of
raisins
a
complex
dry
finish
medium
bodied
racing
carbonation
a
wonderfully
aged
masterpiece
a
more
angular
fizzy
slightly
more
dilute
take
vs
some
other
belgians
but
overall
very
true
overall
a
solid
offering
from
allagash
that
i
definately
started
to
enjoy
as
it
warmed
to
above
60
degrees
or
so
some
excellent
flavors
came
out
but
still
a
little
too
sweet
a
very
good
offering
it
says
it
is
brewed
with
7
malts
the
aroma
seems
to
back
that
up
a
nice
extremely
rounded
smell
of
malt
witha
hint
of
alcohol
presence
a
smooth
taste
follows
that
is
wellrounded
and
fullbodied
leaving
a
hoppy
presence
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
very
drinkable
and
smooth
for
such
a
high
abv
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
allagash
would
be
either
the
white
or
the
tripel
still
if
i
saw
it
somewhere
may
just
have
it
again
pours
a
dark
red
almost
ruby
brown
color
not
a
big
head
but
a
small
amount
remains
the
whole
time
its
in
my
glass
which
then
again
isnt
very
long
the
easiest
dubbel
to
drink
that
i
have
had
to
date
looking
forward
to
trying
other
allagash
offerings
good
brew
appearance
clear
thin
head
but
good
retention
aroma
some
malt
but
also
a
surpisingly
heavy
amount
of
spiciness
perhaps
including
coriander
taste
also
heavily
spicy
and
in
addition
the
malt
flavor
is
very
onedimensional
mouthfeel
thin
for
style
drinkabilty
not
hard
to
drink
but
not
particularly
close
to
style
im
quite
surprised
this
brew
is
rated
as
highly
as
it
is
on
this
site
the
appearance
is
really
nice
thats
about
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
about
it
im
hoping
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
something
but
im
afraid
i
didnt
it
smells
offensive
like
rotten
fruit
the
taste
is
like
a
weird
malt
lemon
juice
7up
and
vodka
along
with
more
rotten
plums
its
very
bitter
in
an
unpleasant
way
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
doesnt
really
do
much
good
when
the
taste
is
this
bad
im
struggling
to
finish
the
glass
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
medium
brown
theres
a
lot
of
esters
in
this
thing
it
almost
makes
you
think
of
a
dunkeweizen
nice
dry
foamy
head
good
bit
of
fruit
fairly
drinkable
for
what
it
is
but
the
sweetness
would
likely
get
to
you
before
too
long
batch
36
with
a
cork
in
the
top
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
thick
head
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
malts
with
some
sweetness
and
some
spices
the
flavor
was
very
similar
to
the
aroma
but
the
alcohol
was
only
partially
masked
the
taste
was
also
a
little
breadlike
and
some
spices
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
drinkability
was
about
the
same
there
are
other
dubbels
that
i
prefer
but
this
is
still
a
good
one
this
one
is
a
little
too
thick
and
smooth
for
a
dubbel
could
also
use
more
spices
in
the
flavor
dark
shiny
red
with
a
sticky
offwhite
creamy
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
an
amoeba
floating
around
for
the
rest
of
the
time
sweet
toasted
malt
and
yeasty
grassy
aromas
touch
of
plums
spicy
belgian
double
flavors
malts
dominate
very
smooth
and
clean
finish
extremely
thin
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
not
great
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
strong
dark
belgian
style
ale
a
bit
onedimensional
or
i
could
have
scored
it
higher
overall
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
brew
from
allagash
even
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
this
style
of
brew
you
must
give
this
one
a
try
the
head
is
huge
tan
and
dense
over
top
of
a
dark
redbrown
beer
sticky
clumps
and
spots
of
lacing
the
smell
is
faintly
peanutty
sweet
with
some
fruit
and
spice
front
is
tangy
nutty
spicy
a
little
chocolate
shows
in
the
malty
middle
leading
to
a
nice
bitter
finish
alcohol
is
a
little
transparent
this
is
pretty
good
but
a
little
more
plain
than
i
was
expecting
decent
tastes
not
bold
dark
garnet
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
nose
is
a
diverse
assortment
of
toasted
malt
caramel
sweetness
dark
fruit
and
herbal
hops
taste
features
notes
of
toasted
malt
candy
sugar
caramel
oatmeal
though
its
not
brewed
with
any
mild
fruitiness
and
an
herbal
dry
hops
finish
especially
smooth
on
draught
but
still
a
touch
too
thin
on
the
palate
fairly
fullbodied
but
loses
some
character
as
it
reaches
room
temperature
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
a
brew
of
this
size
with
its
sweetness
fruit
characteristics
and
balance
all
creating
equal
impressions
definitely
worth
trying
if
found
on
draught
when
poured
it
was
a
nice
medium
dark
brown
with
tight
tan
foam
and
medium
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
toasty
roasted
malts
filled
the
nose
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
mixed
with
toffeecaramel
was
pleasant
but
not
over
powering
i
really
wished
the
taste
was
as
good
as
the
aroma
but
no
ticket
disappointed
a
little
but
not
that
bad
of
a
dubbel
dayton
oh
alefestthe
appearance
consisted
of
a
small
sized
tan
head
with
fine
sized
bubbles
that
mostly
dissipated
its
body
was
clear
and
uncarbonated
with
an
amber
hue
i
detected
a
fruity
sweet
clove
and
malt
nose
with
this
beer
the

only
a
decent
attempt
at
a
double
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
just
seems
a
bit
lackluster
for
a
double
this
was
fairly
clean
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
that
was
accompanied
by
a
hint
of
fruit
and
just
a
tad
of
the
characteristic
spicy
belgian
notes
i
wonder
if
i
got
an
old
bottle
though
with
a
double
one
would
think
that
it
would
age
well
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
color
with
a
medium
off
white
head
slowly
dwindles
down
to
a
nice
lace
aroma
was
that
of
grass
twigs
and
yeast
this
had
the
taste
of
earth
twigs
yeast
chocolate
malt
raisons
or
prunes
really
didnt
like
the
taste
very
much
as
the
yeasty
taste
was
overwhelming
imo
im
glad
i
only
drank
one
dont
think
i
could
have
drank
more
than
that
not
as
aromatic
or
flavorful
as
the
tripel
but
very
smooth
and
balanced
very
enjoyable
and
great
to
share
this
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
brown
with
blood
red
hints
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
very
thick
and
creamy
with
an
off
white
to
tan
color
falling
away
slowly
to
leave
heavy
lacing
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
an
excellent
spicy
hop
laced
with
malty
and
smokey
undertones
the
flavor
is
exceptionally
dry
for
a
belgian
style
dubbel
although
lacking
the
fruity
undertones
like
a
native
belgian
this
one
has
some
very
strong
and
prominent
character
to
it
the
flavor
is
nutty
and
coffee
tinged
with
spice
coriander
very
satisfying
this
is
and
i
find
its
hops
come
on
strong
in
the
end
as
well
i
am
impressed
with
this
one
and
i
have
to
recommend
it
for
it¬ís
uniqueness
appears
deep
copper
amber
brown
with
a
full
two
finger
sized
head
complete
with
astonishing
lacing
throughout
my
session
with
this
brew
arom
is
very
nice
with
a
full
hop
arom
pine
cones
wrapped
in
brown
sugar
and
some
nice
layers
of
spicing
with
buttery
maple
syrup
malt
tones
great
flavor
and
pleasing
to
see
this
many
hops
in
a
dubbel
taste
is
slightly
harsh
from
the
dark
roasts
but
this
nicely
balanced
brew
throws
in
a
wonderful
hop
bitterness
earthy
and
pine
cone
tones
with
a
syrupy
sweet
full
flavor
another
reason
to
bow
down
to
allagash
as
a
premiere
belgium
style
brewery
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
high
in
carbonation
tickles
the
back
of
the
throat
goes
great
with
meat
and
potatoes
had
some
buffalo
meatloaf
and
mashed
potatoes
paired
with
this
awesome
brew
i
cuold
drink
a
couple
bottles
of
this
at
a
sitting
but
not
much
more
than
that
a
great
enjoyable
complex
ale
meant
to
be
enjoyed
and
not
overly
consumed
in
quantity
pours
a
spritzy
brown
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
tan
head
on
top
nose
has
those
wild
belgian
notes
i
identify
it
with
mustiness
and
leather
body
is
juiced
up
but
about
perfect
very
drinkable
sweetness
dominates
this
but
the
charged
up
mouthfeel
keeps
it
at
bay
the
taste
is
relatively
complex
sweet
dark
fruits
some
cotton
candy
like
sweetness
finishes
musty
and
leathery
i
rate
the
drinkability
high
because
id
love
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
a
very
good
dubbel
poured
looking
like
well
steeped
iced
tea
the
flavor
and
taste
didnt
differ
much
from
this
impression
either
dark
mahogany
look
with
virtually
no
head
no
lacing
and
very
little
nose
what
was
there
was
fairly
nondescript
just
a
bit
on
the
tasty
side
with
some
nice
sense
from
the
rich
malt
base
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
not
a
great
beer
by
any
sense
but
easliy
drinkable
in
a
piinch
watery
but
not
too
thin
of
a
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
real
easy
to
drink
because
of
its
mild
but
equitable
character
to
me
this
is
a
lighter
version
of
a
dubbel
for
its
not
as
thick
malty
and
spicy
as
others
good
nonetheless
and
would
probably
go
very
well
with
game
and
subtle
autumn
vegetables
small
bottle
carefully
poured
it
delivers
a
surprisingly
clear
mahogany
with
amberorange
highlights
and
a
short
cap
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
the
retention
is
good
and
it
leaves
some
thin
lacing
about
the
glass
the
aroma
is
delicate
but
fresh
clean
and
fairly
complex
with
notes
of
earth
and
wood
spice
grass
dried
straw
mild
chocolate
and
a
subdued
note
of
vanilla
in
the
mouth
its
very
fine
carbonation
lends
a
gentle
caress
to
the
tongue
against
its
mediumlight
body
the
flavor
starts
with
an
earthy
malt
as
the
spiciness
tries
to
work
its
way
through
it
displays
a
short
note
of
chocolate
and
then
becomes
a
bit
toasty
woody
and
biscuity
before
finishing
with
a
flash
of
dark
fruit
and
a
flourish
of
drying
spiciness
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
does
reveal
itself
a
bit
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
quite
nice
medium
brown
color
large
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
nutty
a
medium
bodied
double
malts
are
fairly
strong
nutty
and
a
touch
sweet
hops
are
a
touch
bitter
touch
of
fruit
and
clove
nicely
balanced
slightly
spicy
touch
of
anise
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and

aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
drinkability
beware
the

hidden
very
well
within
the
flavors
the
pleasingly
smooth
aftertaste
makes
this
one
quite
drinkable
my
first
foray
into
the
world
of
dubbels
was
this
allagash
which
poured
a
deep
cloudy
brownishred
with
a
light
chocolate
head
which
receded
rapidly
the
smell
was
a
balanced
mixture
of
sweet
spices
tartness
and
malt
and
the
taste
did
not
stray
much
from
this
balance
though
i
would
not
say
that
the
taste
was
as
complex
as
the
smell
there
was
carbonation
which
left
my
palate
refreshed
but
a
little
puzzled
the
finish
was
suitably
dry
a
worthy
ale
and
i
admit
im
biased
to
maine
beers
pours
a
murky
brown
with
hints
of
red
initally
sizeable
off
white
head
recedes
to
almost
nothing
leaves
a
decent
lace
in
the
tulip
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
a
musty
earthy
yeast
the
flavor
is
nice
dark
fruity
malts
peppery
spicyness
finishes
dry
my
only
complaint
would
be
that
it
feels
a
little
thin
overall
a
very
drinkable
well
crafted
american
version
of
the
style
recommended
admittingly
im
not
very
experienced
with
dubbels
but
having
said
that
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
it
poured
a
nice
cloudy
amber
with
a
modest
head
and
lace
that
remained
fairly
well
the
smell
was
very
malty
but
had
earthy
and
slightly
fruity
tones
the
taste
was
much
the
same
dominated
by
layers
of
malt
earthy
grainy
and
slightly
fruity
the
body
was
pleasant
but
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
on
the
light
side
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
very
solid
and
definitely
above
average
but
it
is
not
amazing
allagash
dubbel
starts
out
dry
and
crisp
and
finishes
with
a
port
and
nougat
character
brewery
workers
say
they
have
been
cellaring
different
years
since
they
first
bottled
the
dubbel
a
few
years
ago
and
found
that
it
peaks
between
one
and
two
years
i
found
less
of
the
port
of
and
nougat
and
more
the
crisp
fruit
hints
that
probably
come
from
being
a
younger
bottle
i
poured
this
one
in
my
orval
glass
and
it
looked
right
at
home
deep
brown
and
cloudy
with
an
impressive
lumpy
head
just
like
the
belgians
look
aroma
is
earthy
and
sweet
with
suggestions
of
fruit
mixed
in
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
effervescent
flavor
is
outstanding
yeasty
fruity
and
sweet
im
amazed
that
this
was
brewed
in
maine
it
could
easily
pass
for
a
fine
belgian
ale
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
that
borders
on
brown
moderate
off
white
head
fades
to
a
layer
of
thin
foam
the
aroma
is
a
light
malty
aroma
with
an
interesting
spicy
note
reminds
me
of
a
malty
cola
smell
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
good
roasted
notes
true
to
the
bottles
claim
the
finish
is
very
clean
for
such
a
malty
flavorful
beer
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
not
as
memorable
as
other
allagash
offerings
drinkability
is
good
but
this
is
a
good
one
for
me
to
have
purchased
one
of
too
many
other
beers
i
like
more
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
that
much
better
than
average
and
below
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
allagash
batch

finishes
dry
with
a

watery
feel
in

a
decent
dubbel
and
one
which
might
improve
with
age
but
it
didnt
wow
me
on
this
sampling

combination
of
coffee

and
hints
of
toffee
there
is
a
fairly
high
amout
of
bitterness
for
the
style
the
moutfeel
is
light
but
rough
this
is
an
odd
belgian
dubbel
and
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
allagash
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
dark
brown
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
it
forms
a
thick

the
aroma
is

with
a

the
flavor
is
also
medicinal
and
spicy
it
has
a
light
fig
raisin
flavor
not
as
much
as
other
dubbels
i
have
sampled
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
which
i
found
to
be
very
enjoyable
just
not
as
assertive
as
other
dubbels
complex
but
not
as
complex
as
most
of
the
belgian
dubbels
i¬íve
had
nor
as
some
of
the
other
american
dubbels
i¬íve
had
there
is
however
a
delicate
finesse
which
suggests
some
real
skill
in
the
brewhouse
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
if
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
some
other
interpretations
of
the
style
i
havent
had
many
dubbles
so
my
thoughts
are
quite
high
on
this
but
in
that
regards
no
matter
what
its
a
very
darn
good
and
drinkable
dubble
smooth
and
a
bit
sneaky
always
a
good
feature
to
have
in
any
beer
this
is
a
quality
beer
in
belgian
style
allagash
has
thus
far
lived
up
to
all
i
anticipated
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
tripel
while
many
of
belgiums
dubbels
seem
to
be
fullflavored
assaults
on
the
drinkers
tastebuds
this
one
is
quite
laidback
and
easygoing
pours
a
dark
hazy
amber
with
a
creamy
sticky
lace
typical
beligian
aroma
grassy
earthy
and
a
bit
tart
taste
is

earthy

i
did
not
detect
very
much

clean
aftertaste
quite
warming

not
one
of
the
best
dubbels
ive
had

750ml

poured
a

the
initial
taste
was
smooth
and
the
alcohol
taste
was
also
apparent
along
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
it
had
a
pleasant
aroma
and
excellent
lacing
on
the
glass
down
to
the
end
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
the
watery
mouthfeel
and
the
body
and
character
were
lacking
compared
to
other
dubbels
ive
tried
however
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
enjoyable
and
balanced
i
could
easily
finish
off

in
a

providing
i
lost
my
car
keys
i
cant
believe
how
surprised
i
was
by
allagashs
double
offering
after
being
totally
underwhelmed
by
allagashs
white
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
allagashs
double
boy
was
i
wrong
i
bought
a
single
of
it
as
a
throwin
with
a
purchase
of
westmalle
doubele
and
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
it
definately
held
its
own
deep
burgundy
hue
excellent
floral
aromas
i
was
in
love
i
just
bought
a
log
of
it
for
my

cant

try
it
on

the

aftertaste
is
droughty
and
long

another
winner
from
a

magnificent
brewery
that
just
recently
came
back
into
my
life
nice
looking
pour
here
from
a
750ml
bottle
dark
hazy
goldenburgundy
with
a
very
nice
white
frothy
head
the
aroma
is
strong
of
salted
peanuts
with
some
pear
frutiness
in
the
background
the
taste
is
also
nutty
with
a
very
mild
fruitiness
alcohol
is
almost
nonexistent
but
this
brew
has
a
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
a
nice
change
up
from
your
typical
belgian
ale
but
somewhat
lacking
in
overall
character
the
theme
here
is
definitely

my

it

it
poured
a

scarlet
almost

color
with

no

the

full

smells

those
of
grapes

taste
was
full
bodied

notes
and
a
little
bitter

flavor
it
definitely
had
some
typical
belgian
flavors
in

they
did
not

this

this
is
another
excellent
effort
from
the
allagash
brewing
co
drinkability
while
i
found
this
beer
to
be
an
admirable
take
on
the
belgian
style
i
wouldnt
call
this
an
everyday
beer
unless
of
course
you
are
spending

the
flavor
is
nice
and
roasty
it
is
filled
with
dark
malts
and
a
blend
of
hops
to
spice
it
up
a
little
bit
the
yeast
qualities
are
at
a
good
level
and
add
a
great
flavor
to
this
brew
at
the
end
you
will
pick
up
the
alcohol
which
is
faint
for
the
7
but
it
is
definitely
noticeable
the
finish
is
dry

the

hit
you
you
are
left
with
alcohol

a
bready

flavor
isnt
quite

malty

more

and
hops
balances
the
malt
nicely
finish
has
a
slight
tart
fruit
taste
as
well
as
a
faint
lingering
metallic
tang
still
has
a
pretty
strong

taste
fairly
lightbodied

good
brew
but
this
wont
be
my
top
choice
when
i
go
for
another
allagash
or
dubbel
i
cant
remember
the
batch
number
it
was
in
the
thirties
a
good
nice
dark
amber
color
nice
fruity
flavors
and
good
malt
seemed
like
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
after
we
were
pounded
by
another
foot
of
snow
was
not
disappointed

not

the

i
dont

for
more

it
has
a

is
a

its

not
a

at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
on
tap
as
a
big
fan
of
their
agnus
tripel
this
did
not
disappoint
a
full
rich
flavor
perhaps
more
suited
for
months
with
er
at
the
end
of
their
names
but
in
a
world
of
uncertainty
why
wait
if
you
find
this
as
a
choice
not
only
could
you
do
worse
you
will
a
great
dark
beer
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
dubbel
it
has
a
creamy
tan
head
that
lingers
and
has
an
excellent
earthy
aroma
that
is
a
great
match
to
its
rich
malt
flavor
overall
a
very
good
brew
that
wasnt
even
on
my
radar
very
nice
surprise
beautifully
gentle
bubbles
lovely
halfway
point
between
dark
ale
and

superb
balance
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
from
the
bottle
outstanding
example
of
a
dubbel
i
would
only
take
westmalles
and
a
few
others
over
this
lovely
brown
color
rich
toasted
flavor
nice
creamy
body
solid
beer
o
definitely
a
beer
with
some
character
but
easily
quaffable
a
decent
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
this
could
perhaps
be
improved
by
being
slightly
sweeter
but
its
pretty
good
as
is
750

weak
sense

some

nicely

down
the
throat
asking
for
more
some
field
plants
in
aftertaste
almost
like
liquor
very
favorable
o
a
well
crafted
dubbel
if
not
on
the
easier
side
of
a
dubbel
not
a
brown
ale
as
advertised
the
beer
pours
a
moderate
amount
of
light
cream
colored
head
that
lasts
quite
a
bit
and
does
not
dissipate
very
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
brown
with
some
dark
purple
notes
and
is
opaque
the
beer
smell
has
strong
sugar
and
dark
fruit
notes
the
hop
notes
are
also
strong
the
hops
are
closer
to
an
orange
smell
the
belgian
sugar
smell
mixes
very
well
with
the
dark
fruits
and
create
a
very
sweet
note
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
smell
the
beer
still
retain
the
sugardark
fruitorange
hop
taste
but
the
hops
are
a
bit
bitter
and
the
sugary
combo
give
it
a
slightly
artificial
taste
however
the
taste
is
still
fairly
good
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
bodied
but
on
the
lighter
side
the
biting
carbonation
give
the
beer
a
bit
of
texture
in
an
otherwise
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
good
beer
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
with
a
substantial
beige
head
that
has
plenty
of
staying
power
the
aroma
offers
a
big
dose
of
belgian
yeast
brown
bread
alcohol
very
tasty
beer
big
time
yeast
character
with
light
warming
alcohol
easy
drinking
with
a
great
feel
on
the
palate
bready
yeasty
malty
not
too
heavy
perfect
carbonation
level
overall
a
solid
beer
a
fine
example
of
the
style
this
beer
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
im
sure
i
will
be
enjoying
a
corsendonk
from
time
to
time
as
long
as
i
am
able
excellent
beer
not
a
heavy
dubbel
actually
felt
quite
modern
to
me
even
like
an
american
brown
ale
great
balance
on
complexity
and
drinkability
recommendable
poured
a
hazelnut
brown
with
a
ginormous
head
had
to
be
very
gentle
with
it
just
like
a
swedish
lady
in
order
to
pour
it
without
overflowing
with
head
but
it
is
impressive
very
classic
dubbel
characteristics
sweet
beginnings
with
hints
of
plums
and
raisins
light
caramel
and
brown
sugar
and
that
classic
belgian
yeast
touches
of
spice
and
herbs
possibly
cinnamon
and
clove
maybe
the
slightest
touch
of
cola
as
well
spritzy
on
the
palate
but
smooth
at
the
same
time
very
nice
an
interesting
beer
in
the
style
dont
expect
a
brown
ale
but
it
has
those
sweet
notes
but
also
with
a
belgian
fruits
yeast
and
fruits
update
this
beer
is
inconsistent
every
bottle
seems
to
taste
different
first
bottle
is
reviewed
above
the
other
bottles
smelled
like
wet
dog
and
each
bottlr
tasted
different
mf
great
balance
that
brings
tingly
spice
to
the
dry
finish
overall
this
classic
is
my
crowd
pleasing
belgian
beer
suitable
for
anyone
overall

an
excellent
beer
but
not
the
best
dubbel
i
have
ever
had
which
is
like
saying
this
bar
of
gold
is
somewhat
less
oblong
than
i
usually
prefer
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
its
dryness
would
lend
it
to
accompany
almost
any
type
of
food
you
can
think
up
it
is
also
fabulous
for
sessions
and
has
no
hint
of
a
alcohol
or
b
wet
dog
both
of
which
have
the
tendency
to
pop
up
in
some
dubbels

looking

just
my

personal
taste
good
but
seemed
to
be

brown
colored
with
an

hue
and
almost
clear
initial
head
is
frothy

tan
but
settles
down
to
a
thin

that
is

chocolate
with
a

also
a

mouthfeel
is

a

flavor
is

a

overall
one
of
the

dubbels
ive
had
poured
nice
hazy
amber
brown
from
750ml
with
fizzy
tanish
head
smelled
wonderful
fruity
wine
like
then
i
tasted
it
more
like
champagne
then
beer
carbonation
way
over
done
for
my
taste
wouldnt
call
it
a
brown
ale
at
all
hell
wouldnt
even
call
it
a
beer
if
i
just
had
bad
sample
someone
let
me
know
and
i
will
try
it
again
should
have
let
it
sit
overnight
and
gone
flat
probably
would
have
been
much
more
appealing
stronger
than
it
seems
espcially
from
a
750ml
very
drinkable
watch
out
for
the
way
the
abv
and
drinkability
interact
this
ale
pours
a
nice
shade
of
brown
a
very
thick
light
tan
head
was
on
top
and
never
left
there
is
a
yeasty
fruity
aroma
with
a
slight
bit
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
nice
malt
raisins
and
tones
of
bread
yeast
mixed
in
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
the
pale
ale
from
corsendunk
a
very
smooth
drinking
dubble
and
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
try
this
you
wont
be
disappointed
had
this
one
out
of
a
750ml
bottle
and
finished
every
last
drop
it
poured
a
dark
brownish
color
with
a
nice
head
that
settled
into
a
half
inch
pillow
on
top
of
the
beer
this
one
had
a
berryish
smell
and
kind
of
reminded
me
of
champaigne
the
flavor
is
also
champaigne
like
with
some
nice
spices
and
a
very
bubbily
mouthfeel
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
the
time
for
sure
but
i
can
definantly
respect
the
quality
and
the
flavour
of
the
style
this
was
a
really
easy
beer
to
drink
has
a
nice
variety
of
flavors
and
a
pleasant
aroma
thanks
to
the
propriator
at
lucky
baldwins
dave
farnsworth
for
the
great
treat
nicely
carbonated
zesty
carbonation
in
the
nose
picked
up
some
berry
scents
and
flavors
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
malt
and
the
sour
overtones
had
hints
of
some
of
the
st
bernardus
12
flavors
but
soft
as
velvet
will
drink
this
again
and
again
a
superb
beer
i
dont
think
ive
ever
described
the
flavor
of
a
beer
as
zingy
before
but
that
is
what
comes
to
mind
here
very
bright
with
sharp
carbonation
that
tingles
on
the
tongue
quite
pleasantly
tart
up
front
with
flavors
of
dried
cherries
and
cranberries
alcohol
is
in
the
mix
with
a
bit
of
white
pepper
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
white
wineish
bittersweetness
lingers
on
the
tongue
muddles
the
line
between
a
dubbel
and
an
oud
bruin
quite
nicely
corsendonk
poured
with
a
huge
head
that
made
it
difficult
to
pour
without
overflowing
the
glass
very
bubbly
rocky
top
color
was
a
dark
reddishbrown
that
was
almost
the
color
of
the
bottle
the
color
was
clear
until
the
bottle
was
emptied
and
the
remaining
yeast
was
poured
out
when
the
head
retreated
it
left
a
nice
think
foamy
lace
the
nose
was
of
malt
with
the
scent
of
alcohol
being
evident
some
citrus
and
yeast
notes
were
also
apparent
in
the
aroma
the
strong
carbonation
was
the
first
thing
to
hit
the
tongue
and
there
was
a
slight
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
but
it
wasn¬ít
overbearing
flavors
were
of
sweet
fruity
malts
and
yeast
with
some
citrusy
notes
as
the
beer
warmed
it
became
more
think
and
bready
some
spices
were
also
noticeable
on
the
tongue
not
much
hops
to
this
beer
but
there
was
a
slight
bitterness
towards
the
end
that
was
just
right
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
the
belgian
style
i
found
this
to
be
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
on
tap
poured
into
a
corsendonk
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
left
the
smell
is
fairly
malty
and
nutty
a
pretty
sweet
aroma
the
taste
has
a
very
strong
coffee
maltiness
with
bits
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
strong
and
heavy
the
drinkability
isnt
bad
for
7
5
a
good
brown
ale
nice
hazy
brown
color
with
a
plethora
of
head
that
doesnt
go
away
a
nice
sweet
belgium
style
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
raisons
once
you
get
through
the
head
there
is
a
great
sweet
and
full
taste
where
the
chocolate
and
raisons
really
come
out
there
is
practically
no
biterness
to
this
beer
as
expected
a
very
nice
taste
with
fruity
accents
the
rathskeller
wine
beer
festwhen
poured
this
beer
had
a
small
sized
tan
head
with
fine
sized
bubbles
that
fully
diminished
the
body
was
clear
with
no
carbonation
observed
the
hue
was
brown
and
the
aroma
was
fruity
spicy
malty
and
lightly
hopped
the
flavor
was
lightly
sweet
and
lightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
smooth
slightly
tingly
thin
and
light
bodied
this
beer
left
virtually
no
lacing
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
it
looks
likes
a
witches
brew
not
very
enticing
the
aroma
is
better
its
quite
spicey
and
reminds
me
of
a
weak
whiskey
smell
the
taste
is
good
again
there
are
a
bit
of
spices
here
it
tastes
like
a
strong
rootbeer
or
a
really
weak
whiskey
with
fruity
overtones
the
mouthfeel
is
good
the
carbonation
is
just
right
this
is
a
lightmed
bodied
beer
it
drinks
well
despite
its
appearance
a
nice
compromise
between
wild
and
domesticated
beer
styles
more
refreshing
than
ommegang
or
birra
di
rosa
less
challenging
than
goudenband
you
start
off
with
some
tingly
carbonation
sweet
malts
jump
in
grains
fill
the
backround
and
the
yeasty
flavor
kicks
in
later
there
is
no
real
bitterness
but
earthy
notes
add
complexity
roasty
and
chocolate
malts
come
in
the
finish
and
continue
to
hit
the
mouth
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
smooth
fullbodied
brew
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brownred
color
with
a
decent
head
and
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
a
weiss
beer
with
malts
also
present
the
flavor
did
not
correspond
with
the
aroma
very
well
as
the
flavor
was
malty
but
the
wheat
was
not
present
very
pleasing
taste
i
liked
this
beer
much
more
than
i
expected
i
would
flavor
is
mainly
belgian
sweetness
a
touch
roasty
and
cocoalike
with
lots
of
fruity
flavors
including
plum
raisin
and
sweet
pineapple
sort
of
syrupy
in
mouthfeel
full
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
but
sort
of
dull
its
got
all
the
belgian
flavors
you
come
to
expect
but
i
just
didnt
really
get
a
kick
out
of
it
i
had
to
try
to
finish
the
snifter
on
the
last
14
glass
i
was
trying
to
make
tasting
notes
and
nothing
was
standing
out
beyond
the
belgian
candi
sweetness
and
esters
i
guess
im
just
not
into
belgian
style
beers
particularly
this
one
pours
with
a
burgundy
color
and
a
huge
head
that
is
very
well
retained
aroma
is
of
ripe
plum
taste
is
of
plum
raisins
and
a
little
sour
cherry
im
very
impressed
with
all
the
flavors
in
this
beer
i
would
have
thought
a
beer
this
easy
to
find
would
be
of
lesser
quality
but
this
doesnt
suffer
from
the
massproduced
taste
for
some
reason
this
one
always
seems
to
hit
the
spot
for
me
i
love
how
all
the
ingredients
mix
so
well
to
create
this
fabulous
belgian
beer
quite
sweet
with
various
malts
lots
of
plums
raisins
and
other
fruit
in
it
tarty
apples
are
apparent
a
slight
alcohol
comes
in
the
middle
providing
me
with
a
comfortable
warming
sensation
the
belgian
yeast
is
noticeable
throughout
and
really
makes
for
an
interesting
if
not
great
mouthfeel
this
is
my
comfort
beer
as
is
the
case
with
their
triple
this
is
an
excellent
but
not
great
belgian
ale
dark
in
color
and
flavor
flavor
displays
notes
of
chocolate
maybe
some
cherry
not
overly
sweet
and
quite
smooth
maybe
a
bit
thinner
and
drier
than
the
best
of
the
style
but
this
would
always
be
a
good
alternative
this
poured
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
bubbly
white
campaign
like
head
we
drank
this
delightful
sparkling
beer
while
sitting
in
the
sun
and
brewing
a
california
common
this
beer
although
high
in
alchohol
made
a
great
sipping
beer
the
aroma
complemented
the
fine
light
taste
the
bubbles
tingled
the
tongue
and
the
tartness
made
me
thirsty
for
the
next
sip
it
was
a
nice
drinkable
beer
in
a
social
sitting
poured
a
medium
brown
color
with
medium
head
that
left
some
real
nice
lacingaroma
of
powdered
sugar
and
dried
fruit
with
a
bood
malt
accent
a
somewhat
fruity
taste
with
a
deep
malty
background
a
little
sweet
with
a
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
one
but
not
to
bad
on
tap
at
ale
marys
poured
a
deep
brown
with
some
scarlet
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
accompanied
by
a
deep
tan
head
about
a
fingers
width
thick
the
smell
was
not
very
complex
which
surprised
me
a
little
some
indistinct
malts
and
an
overall
yeastywheat
aroma
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
taste
was
sweet
but
heavy
with
notes
of
rasberry
and
cherry
witha
chalky
mouthfeel
even
though
this
did
not
get
an
extremely
high
rating
i
liked
it
a
lot
and
will
always
be
up
for
a
pint
not
too
expensive
even
for
pub
standards
a
very
good
looking
brew
that
pours
out
a
brownish
amber
color
with
a
very
robust
head
the
head
is
a
bit
lasting
and
laces
very
well
the
nose
gives
off
fruit
and
dried
fruit
aromas
this
beer
is
really
in
the
taste
as
it
starts
out
with
a
heavy
clovish
sense
and
modulates
into
a
more
enjoyable
spiced
fruit
flavor
there
appear
to
be
a
number
of
flavors
competing
for
dominance
here
the
feel
is
very
heavy
and
has
real
bite
to
it
this
is
more
a
sipping
than
a
gulping
beer
drinkability
i
wasnt
really
fond
of
this
one
it
was
ok
but
something
about
it
just
didnt
sit
well
with
me
i
didnt
find
myself
wanting
to
drain
the
glass
the
corsendonk
brown
poured
a
dark
brown
as
expected
the
smell
was
heavily
malty
this
beer
had
a
fairly
heavy
taste
almost
more
like
a
stout
still
an
enjoyable
taste
all
in
all
the
mouthfeel
was
very
heavy
heavier
than
most
other
dubbels
this
could
be
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
to
have
a
few
of
although
with
summer
coming
up
probably
somewhat
less
so
all
in
all
a
beer
id
certainly
have
again
super
appearance
bown
with
a
reddish
glow
to
it
and
a
potentially
masive
offwhite
head
that
has
little
lacing
effect
an
extremely
fruity
beer
apple
cider
and
some
grapelike
flavors
to
name
the
most
dominant
this
ale
is
sweet
with
some
alcohol
spice
to
balance
but
not
much
more
than
feint
hops
action
highly
carbonated
and
sweet
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
excellent
as
well
with
a
dryer
taste
than
the
nose
that
is
well
balanced
with
mid
level
hoppiness
that
settles
off
and
leaves
a
sweeter
malt
aftertaste
the
taste
is
busy
and
complex
with
smooth
transitions
very
satisfying
one
of
the
nicest
colors
in
a
beer
fun
to
examine
sort
of
a
cloudy
root
beerplumteak
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
which
fades
but
remains
as
a
thin
cover
then
reveals
a
runny
lace
fun
to
examine
the
aroma
is
complex
with
a
yeasty
clove
dominating
and
citrus
herbal
malt
and
alcoholic
fragrances
coming
into
play
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
oily
feel
and
citrus
bitterness
is
noticeable
woodpressed
apple
cider
comes
to
mind
thsi
is
indeed
a
cult
classic
corsendonk
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
breweries
this
brew
is
indicative
of
what
they
offer
a
very
spicey
and
nutty
aroma
and
flavor
the
appearance
is
something
to
behold
in
all
of
its
deep
dark
brown
glory
well
with
the
cost
to
try
prost
typically
belgian
foamy
head
hissing
and
fizzy
and
hard
to
contain
aroma
is
spicy
and
peppery
and
the
color
is
mahogany
brown
the
head
is
very
resilient
taste
like
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
peppery
with
an
echo
of
malt
interesting
mix
of
sweetness
and
spice
i
find
myself
coming
back
to
this
beer
im
editing
this
review
many
months
after
i
first
wrote
it
this
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
the
first
thought
that
came
to
mind
when
i
poured
this
was
¬ìit¬ís
alive¬î
upon
initial
pouring
a
huge
thick
offwhite
froth
arose
from
my
glass
it
took
what
seemed
like
an
eternity
for
it
to
die
down
leaving
a
nice
12inch
head
moderate
lace
was
left
on
the
sides
aromas
of
raisins
cherries
plums
and
malts
with
hints
of
chocolate
emerged
from
underneath
the
foam
the
taste
matched
the
aromas
quite
well
leaving
a
clean
dry
finish
all
of
the
flavors
were
exceptionally
balance
with
minimal
bitterness
i
definitely
can¬ít
wait
to
try
this
one
again
body
is
nice
and
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
i
may
seek
this
one
out
again
but
there
are
others
out
there
of
this
style
i
prefer
hazy
brown
with
a
coarse
tan
head
smells
like
sour
green
apples
and
white
raisins
baked
in
butter
and
spiced
with
cinnamon
the
taste
is
along
the
same
likes
with
additional
flavors
of
yeast
and
toasted
grains
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
too
prickly
for
me
but
i¬íll
live
somehow
a
clean
acidic
bite
was
able
to
cut
through
the
brew
without
being
out
of
place
or
inappropriate
tasty
beer
that
i
always
enjoy
enjoy
going
back
to
every
now
and
again
a
good
brew
they
have
on
tap
at
my
local
watering
hole
all
the
time
an
easy
one
to
fall
back
on
when
needing
a
dark
brew
12oz
bottle
this
one
isnt
too
expensive
for
a
belgian
bottle
it
was
6
50
at
eulogy
this
one
was
very
nice
after
two
lindemans
framboises
and
exactly
what
i
wanted
i
would
say
it
is
true
to
the
belgian
brown
ale
style
very
similar
to
kwak
the
end
tastes
especially
like
kwak
the
carbination
which
starts
off
mild
and
kicks
in
late
is
very
strange
to
my
american
taste
buds
i
like
strange
this
is
definitely
a
keeper
says
is
best
enjoyd
before
5

n
the
label
from
a
12oz
noncorked
bottle
it
pours
with
a
hazy
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
pink
toned
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
still
delivers
a
smokey
great
nose
of
apple
fig
raisins
and
possibly
other
fruits
very
sweet
in
the
aroma
not
a
lot
of
hop
character
there
the
taste
is
a
little
stale
and
i
am
going
to
get
another
bottle
it
is
still
enjoyable
but
the
flavors
are
not
present
which
usually
are
in
this
abbey
ale
the
fruity
sweetess
is
all
there
with
some
spicy
kick
to
it
but
it
has
mellowed
and
become
much
smoother
a
very
drinkable
creamy
robust
mouthfeel
is
still
here
however
the
drinkabiltiy
of
this
beer
unless
you
have
it
on
tap
is
kind
of
low
due
to
the
fact
that
its
flavors
are
so
complex
i
love
this
beer
and
the
first
time
i
had
it
was
at
fuel
and
fuddle
where
the
bartender
gaves
us
a
free
750
ml
corked
bottle
and
that
day
my
friends
and
i
learned
what
beer
is
capable
of
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
flavor
that
goes
down
much
too
easy
for
the
alcohol
in
this
somewhat
aged
beer
not
my
favorite
beer
but
definitely
one
that
i
found
full
respect
for
due
to
the
lesson
it
served
to
my
palate
of
being
so
complex
drinkability
good
this
bottle
may
have
been
a
bit
too
old
i
will
review
a
fresher
bottle
when
i
get
a
chance
taste
is
incredibly
complex
very
sweet
and
fruittasting
i
got
tones
of
apples
prunes
and
brown
sugar
the
antithesis
to
an
ipa
almost
no
hops
flavor
to
be
detected
but
very
very
tasty
its
better
at
room
temperature
or
just
slightly
chilled
so
many
flavors
working
together
this
is
a
beer
to
rival
grannys
best
baked
goods
cloudy
copper
color
huge
offwhite
head
which
slowly
diminished
to
leave
strong
lace
aroma
is
yeaty
doughy
bready
flavor
is
quite
sweet
and
fruity
raisin
cotton
candy
and
a
slight
bubblegum
and
banana
in
there
very
tingly
mouthfeel
there
are
many
belgian
ales
that
far
surpass
this
one
corsendonk
abbey
brown
ale
in
the
big
750
ml
bottle
with
a
cork
on
top
served
as
part
of
the
big
christmas
celebration
the
consensus
of
the
group
was
that
this
was
less
satisfying
than
the
allagash
double
when
i
poured
it
vigorously
into
the
chalice
i
managed
to
generate
some
head
but
it
was
rather
thin
and
did
not
last
too
long
this
beer
was
dominated
by
malts
which
tasted
to
me
anyway
like
a
bowlful
of
raisons
this
beer
simply
had
too
much
driedsweet
flavor
for
me
left
a
sweet
and
warming
alcohol
trace
in
its
wake
if
it
was
up
to
me
i¬íd
go
with
the
allagash
not
that
this
was
not
a
fine
beer
but
i
thought
the
allagash
was
better
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
but
nothing
exceptional
though
its
taste
is
its
strongpoint
they
also
detract
from
its
drinkability
somewhat
amazing
ive
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
corsendonk
pours
a
beautiful
white
head
that
is
one
of
the
largest
ive
seen
in
a
beer
to
date
and
it
stays
very
carbonated
throughout
the
glass
the
taste
is
frustratingly
complex
its
frustrating
because
its
nearly
impossible
to
place
all
the
flavors
what
i
detected
was
mainly
cherry
and
apple
with
about
a
million
other
fruit
and
malt
flavors
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
beers
that
can
hold
their
own
against
fine
wine
anyday
its
actually
more
complex
than
most
of
the
wine
ive
had
all
i
can
say
is
go
out
and
get
your
piehooks
on
a
bottle
of
this
asap
complex
and
really
enjoyable
beer
another
reason
why
i
keep
coming
back
to
the
belgian
styles
while
served
cold
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
good
if
narrowfocused
allowing
it
to
warm
brought
out
a
much
richer
vibrant
slightly
caramel
taste
though
oddly
enough
it
only
seemed
to
stimulate
the
forward
taste
buds
this
is
why
i
scored
the
mouthfeel
a
3
5
but
dont
let
that
dissuade
you
from
trying
abbey
brown
ale
out
i
dont
think
youll
be
disappointed
being
a
corsendonk
fan
imagine
my
joy
of
finding
it
on
tap
north
of
boston
it
poured
a
nice
chestnutbrown
with
a
tan
head
when
i
picked
up
the
glass
it
was
a
corsendonk
glass
i
almost
got
frostbite
served
as
cold
as
a
lager
after
holding
it
between
my
hands
for
ten
minutes
it
began
to
give
off
wonderful
floral
and
fruit
notes
plum
describes
this
aroma
very
well
the
taste
started
to
come
around
to
that
nice
malty
orange
peel
flavor
with
under
tones
of
alcohol
and
spice
once
it
was
above
50f
sadly
by
this
time
it
had
lost
the
effervescence
of
its
rich
yeasty
head
the
richness
of
corsendonks
complexity
from
its
yeasty
head
and
spicy
malt
was
lost
what
should
have
been
a
5
was
reduced
to
a
4
due
to
inept
serving
such
a
shame
it
was
still
a
good
ale
but
should
have
been
a
great
ale
406
pours
with
an
immense
towering
long
lasting
light
tan
head
settling
over
hazy
tawny
ruby
colored
liquid
featuring
a
powerfully
active
carbonation
the
nose
is
malty
chocolatey
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
in
the
back
has
a
taste
reminiscent
of
port
wine
with
hints
of
chocolate
malty
sweetness
and
estery
yeast
fruitiness
all
tasted
finishes
sweet
with
a
slight
tang
and
dark

notes
a
superbly
crafted
abbey
style
dubbel
pleasant
deep
brown
color
on
the
pour
with
a
benevolent
light
brown
head
oodles
of
lace
which
clings
mightily
to
the
glass
the
nose
is
fruity
plums
over
ripe
apples
maybe
front
sweet
malt
laden
with
the
top
moderate
in
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
middling
in
carbonation
tart
sparingly
hopped
which
leads
to
a
droughty
aftertaste
well
worth
a
sample
and
a
quite
decent
drinking
beer
poured
with
a
lot
of
light
brown
foam
and
the
color
was
of
a
reddish
brown
aroma
was
kind
of
a
malty
smell
along
with
the
flavor
after
tasting
this
beer
a
pleasant
tasting
beer
with
no
bitterness
on
the
after
taste
after
drinking
this
brown
ale
i
was
very
pleased
i
would
put
this
as
my
number
one
brown
ale
from
belgium
so
far
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
real
thick
white
head
super
complexity
a
multitude
of
flavors
super
smooth
super
balanced
i
am
at
a
loss
for
decribing
the
different
aspects
of
the
flavor
every
taste
brings
out
something
new
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
my
first
belgian
beer
thank
god
for
belgium
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
just
off
white
head
that
lasts
through
the
glass
with
good
lace
aromas
of
yeast
and
light
fruits
and
a
nice
full
but
not
overpowering
taste
nice
clean
dry
finnish
the
last
sip
was
the
best
as
the
beer
warmed
to
room
temp
so
good
i
ordered
another
traded
for
this
one
although
it
turns
out
you
can
find
it
in
ohio
after
all
thick
slowly
dissipating
head
that
lasted
pretty
much
the
whole
glass
rather
dark
amber
color
very
complex
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
and
fruit
was
that
really
raisin
this
one
definitely
improved
as
it
approached
room
temperature
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
the
pale
ale
very
enjoyable
top
notch
notes
quite
complex
between
the
fruity
yeasty
and
malt
chracters
an
obvious
cult
classic
pours
a
hazy
deep
mahogany
robe
topped
by
a
full
frothy
rocky
head
the
head
holds
extremely
well
keeping
a
creamy
18
head
throughout
the
glass
unfortunately
it
doesnt
leave
any
lace
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
very
rich
with
a
vibrant
sweet
malt
and
a
mellow
combination
of
fruits
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
very
fine
and
highly
effervescent
carbonation
giving
a
caress
to
the
tongue
and
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
offers
a
candyish
sweetness
with
bright
notes
of
ripe
fruit
the
alcohol
is
only
lightly
present
and
can
at
times
give
the
impression
of
fine
brandy
the
finish
is
surprisingly
semidry
with
a
light
flourish
of
hops
at
the
swallow
leaving
a
light
softly
lingering
sweet
maltiness
extremely
well
balanced
never
allowing
the
sweetness
to
become
cloying
an
exceptional
beer
that
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
classics
of
the
style
absolutely
enjoyable

start
to
finish

some

a

makes
it
an
after
dinner
beer
for
me
taste
was
more
subtle
and
improved
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
quite
nice
i
thought
it
was
more
sweet
and
less
bitter
than
the
pale
but
thats
probably
often
the
case
when
dark
malts
are
involved
not
that
im
saying
that
this
is
always
the
case
this
like
the
plae
has
a
lovely
soft
yeast
flavour
plus
they
hap
cool
bottle
designs
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brownish
amber
color
and
formed
a
light

that
left
little
lacemight
have
had
chilled
too
cold
some
degree
of
carbonation
the
aroma
was
of
grapesraisin
the
flavor
was
of
grapesraisin
spice
and
light
chocolate
the
finish
was
a
bit
tart
with
some
elements

i
was

more

in
the
taste
very
smooth
and
drinkable
nothing
here
is
overwhelming
just
smooth
and
silky
this
concoction
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
yeasty
fruity
bouquet
and
notes
of
port
raisins
and
black
chocolate
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
belgians
large
foamy
light
tan
head
the
body
is
a
deep
ruby
brown
its
a
very
aromatic
beer
right
after
i
poured
it
i
could
smell
the
floral
fruitiness
of
it
from
3
feet
away
even
with
mild
sinus
pressure
very
pleasant
aroma
i
may
have
picked
up
some
caramel
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
sharp
citrus
aspects
and
some
sweetness
there
was
something
else
that
i
couldnt
place
and
cant
seem
to
describe
it
was
a
little
bit
of
a
dissapointment
due
to
its
lack
of
complexity
compared
to
some
of
the
other
belgians
ive
had
good
beer
ok
belgian
i
love
this
brew
abbey
brown
ales
rule
corsendonk
makes
some
serious
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
pale
ale
and
their
christmas
ale
a
classic
and
delicious
abbey
brown
raisins
dark
plum
nuts
and
lovely
malty
sweetness
blend
together
for
an
awesome
brew
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
know
a
lot
of
folks
think
this
is
a
classic
but
the
flavor
is
too
weak
while
complex
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
definitive
in
its
taste
profile
does
have
a
stunning
appearance
though
o
this
is
an
exceptional
dubbel
and
the
best
new
beer
to
come
from
ommegang
in
some
time
not
that
others
have
been
bad
but
this
packs
so
much
uniqueness
and
keeps
to
dubbel
tradition
while
its
quality
is
top
shelf
the
best
of
this
series
ive
had
thus
far
and
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
getting
a
yearly
seasonal
bottling
delightful
beer
it
is
gorgeous
in
the
glass
full
of
promise
and
mystery
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
for
me
a
bit
thin
a
mix
of
yeast
and
fruit
basket
the
flavour
however
is
delightful
and
multilayered
caramel
cherry
cola
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
pop
up
in
various
places
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
are
exactly
what
you
hope
for
in
a
dubbel
fizzy
slightly
boozy
and
warming
add
the
game
of
thrones
reference
and
you
have
the
full
package
winter
is
coming
a
dark
burnished
copper
that
is
full
of
reddish
highlights
and
even
a
gentle
pour
yields
a
huge
persistent
layer
of
foam
the
smell
is
very
vinous
with
many
notes
of
dark
fruit
a
little
bit
of
dark
bread
some
caramel
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
some
yeast
character
the
taste
starts
out
with
the
caramel
and
overall
the
profile
is
narrower
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
it
would
be
cherry
is
fairly
heavy
in
the
taste
as
mentioned
by
other
reviewers
but
im
not
getting
as
much
yeast
or
malt
as
is
typical
from
a
top
notch
dubbel
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
only
a
little
tingly
as
there
is
no
significant
bitterness
and
the
carbonation
while
somewhat
high
is
so
made
up
of
such
fine
bubbles
that
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
heaviness
of
the
beer
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
not
great
but
quite
drinkable
and
flavorful
enough
to
make
it
worth
a
try
still
celebrating
at
liberty
craft
house
dark
ruby
body
with
a
halo
of
offwhite
head
plum
grapefruit
apple
with
caramelized
sweet
scents
to
add
to
the
allure
smooth
slightly
dry
and
rather
easy
drinking
but
syrupy
and
drawing
as
well
heavy
fullbodied
mouthfeel
warming
as
a
dubbel
should
be
sharp
and
hoppy
and
not
much
of
a
variation
from
their
normal
offerings
thus
not
worth
the
17
shoprite
was
asking
but
well
worth
the
6
glass
today
o
delicious
stuff
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
on
the
palate
but
thats
splitting
hairs
definitely
recommended
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
well
balanced
for
the
type
of
beer
that
it
is
enjoyed
it
reading
my
got
book
a
little
expensive
for
what
you
get
but
i
have
no
problems
with
buying
this
one
but
a
second
might
be
a
stretch
o
enjoyable
and
very
solid
for
an
american
representation
of
the
style
great
flavors
and
pretty
good
complexity
for
the
abv
ommegang
makes
some
great
beers
so
i
trust
what
they
put
their
name
on
i
now
want
to
drink
an
abbey
ale
and
see
how
that
one
stacks
up
o
an
acceptable
dubbel
but
overshadowed
by
stronger
examples
from
belgian
and
even
a
canadian
brewer
unibroue
o
quite
good
a
nice
sipper
and
a
solid
dubbel
i
really
enjoyed
the
many
flavors
that
this
brew
offered
cant
wait
for
the
next
one
would
order
again
but
limited
as
these
bottles
are
costing
c12
00
each
here
on
the
west
coast
of
canada
cant
say
ive
had
a
lot
of
american
made
belgians
but
this
is
true
to
form
definitely
worth
a
try
a
bit
more
transparent
than
i
like
in
a
belgian
style
ale
nice
aroma
but
only
after
it
warms
tastes
ok
but
no
match
for
the
great
belgian
dubbels
i
really
liked
this
beer
cherries
plums
lots
of
dark
fruits
and
this
overly
sweet
brown
sugar
that
throws
of
the
balance
not
as
malty
as
most
belgian
dubbels
light
fruitiness
with
flavor
of
dark
cherries
dry
overall
flavor
grew
on
me
fantastic
not
your
typical
dubbel
and
i
tasted
a
lot
of
nice
sweet
flavors
cherry
strawberry
was
refreshing
without
being
too
heavy
i
bet
this
would
come
together
with
a
little
age
caramel
sweetness
and
spicing
from
the
yeast
seem
to
be
fighting
to
dominate
the
palate
o
very
good
and
drinkable
dubbel
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
12
finger
fizzy
head
of
very
light
almost
white
color
smells
of
sweet
caramel
and
hints
of
nut
taste
is
initially
smooth
with
a
sweet
nutty
taste
on
the
backend
there
is
a
bit
out
carbonation
but
not
overwhelming
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
my
first
dubbel
ale
so
take
this
review
for
what
its
worth
the
taste
is
bready
at
first
with
some
raisin
in
the
middle
and
subtle
toast
and
nutty
flavor
from
the
malt
with
a
gentle
sweetness
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
slight
spice
quality
from
the
yeast
which
in
the
realm
of
phenolics
is
not
quite
medicinal
and
the
alcohol
is
almost
undetectable
for
the
strength
overall
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
expectations
were
met
and
exceeded
this
is
a
style
ommegang
has
mastered
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
so
far
in
the
game
of
thrones
series
overall
pretty
good
pretty
much
standard
dubble
with
nice
esters
and
phenols
booze
comes
through
as
expected
perfumey
booze
with
lots
of
nice
candied
dates
figs
and
brown
sugar
molasses
like
flavors
pretty
nice
by
far
the
best
of
these
game
of
thrones
wankfests
thus
far
the
resemblance
to
a
wellmade
belgian
dubbel
is
remarkable
easy
to
drink
not
as
sweet
as
i
might
have
indicated
over
and
again
here
and
with
a
decently
integrated
big
abv
im
not
drinking
this
out
of
a
pewter
mug
or
whatever
the
hell
they
use
on
the
show
but
that
wont
diminish
my
enjoyment
of
the
rest
of
this
big
boy
any
non
belgian
attempt
of
a
belgian
style
usually
falls
flat
but
not
this
one
a
nice
combo
of
belgian
dubble
and
local
flavours
make
for
a
decent
beer
overall
this
is
a
worthy
and
unique
dubbel
overall
ommegang
has
the
belgian
thing
down
pat
and
this
is
a
really
nice
dubbel
ommegang
just
flat

nose
with
some
subtle
bitterness
on
the
edges
there
was
a
bit
of
grassy
notes
on
the
tongue
with
the
malt
coming
through
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
mouth
feel
was
on
the
full
bodied
side
of
medium
this
is
my
favourite
of
the
game
of
thrones
series
good
starting
flavor
lace
initial
high
end
taste
with
limited
follow
thru
empty
on
the
backend
lacking
that
lasting
flavor
enjoyed
by
draft
my
favorite
beer
that
i
have
tested
boring
beer
overall
drinkable
but
not
memorable
mouthfeel
is
right
lighter
than
a
quad
or
bsda
but
still
rich
and
inviting
the
spiciness
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
overall
another
good
offering
from
ommegang
all
men
must
die
indeed
this
beer
has
a
woody
malty
scent
and
nice
bold
flavors
to
it
i
like
the
general
ruddy
quality
to
the
color
and
the
frothy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
the
taste
is
earthy
with
just
a
hint
of
fruitiness
in
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
though
a
bit
thicklathery
on
the
edge
of
the
tongue
but
the
quaintness
of
it
is
solid
this
may
not
transport
me
to
westeros
or
braavos
or
where
ever
im
supposed
to
be
going
but
overall
it
satisfies
serving
type
on
tap
although
i
dont
typically
care
for
the
classic
murky
brown
dubbel
look
this
beer
had
it
nailed
and
that
counts
for
something
the
smell
was
a
combination
of
cherry
brown
sugar
and
toffee
and
deeper
whiffs
revealed
a
pungency
associated
with
carbonation
the
taste
had
a
brown
sugar
flavor
featured
prominently
this
was
followed
by
cherry
and
caramel
and
finally
a
bite
of
carbolic
acid
basically
the
smell
and
the
taste
were
self
fulfilling
the
body
was
chewy
and
had
a
soft
silky
feel
to
it
this
was
a
quality
dubbel
but
as
a
special
release
it
was
a
bit
too
ordinary
great
dubbel
really
enjoyed
this
one
so
so
good
the
second
time
i
had
it
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
the
first
time
i
had
it
so
it
loses
a
tiny
bit
on
the
consistency
side
but
make
no
mistakethis
is
easily
the
best
game
of
thrones
beer
that
ommegang
makes
amber
rich
malty
slightly
smoky
just
ok
valar
morghulis
is
a
common
greeting
in
braavos
meaning
all
men
must
die
in
high
valyrian
it
is
meant
in
the
sense
of
all
men
must
eventually

overall
my
favorite
brew
from
ommegang
they
absolutely
nail
the
flavors
in
this
one
nice
nutty
flavor
with
some
spice
o
2
75
i
think
all
ommegang
beers
have
the
same
flavor
profile
and
i
dont
like
it
i
am
sure
it
is
some
peoples
thing
but
its
not
mine
this
one
looked
decent
in
the
glass
but
it
went
downhill
from
there
i
have
had
this
one
in
the
fridge
for
a
long
time
i
kept
passing
it
over
in
fear
that
i
would
not
like
it
i
was
right
the
belgian
flavor
profile
just
doesnt
work
for
me
lesson
learned
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
an
exquisite
beer
ommegang
knows
exactly
what
they
are
doing
when
it
comes
to
this
sort
of
beer
and
they
have
yet
to
disappoint
this
is
an
absolute
knockout
beer
that
i
have
as
of
yet
been
able
to
consume
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
definitely
seek
this
one
out
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
o
my
favorite
ommegang
outstanding
example
of
a
dubbel
im
still
learning
to
distinguish
one
taste
and
smell
from
another
but
i
drink
enough
of
these
things
to
know
when
one
is
good
and
one
is
not
haha
wow
such
a
well
balanced
abbey
mild
notes
of
fruit
hints
of
spice
and
yeast
backbone
are
just
right
too
me
there
is
not
one
negative
thing
to
say
about
the
tastes
from
start
to
finish
for
a
8

abv
its
only
noticed
with
a
slight
warming
tingle
will
buy
again
by
the
case
well
done
again
ommegang
wow
an
all
around
delicious
abbey
ale
smooth
and
well
balanced
one
of
the
better
dubbels
ive
ever
tried
beautiful
great
mouth
feel
and
very
complex
flavor
well
balanced
while
still
being
very
pungent
and
memorable
excellent
very
dark
sweet
flavor
exceptional
brew
ruddy
color
with
a
fluffy

that
lingers
nicely
seems
to
keep
the
aroma

up
swirled
in

it
conjures
the
sweet
dark
air
of
bananas
foster
feels
every
bit
the
abbey

moniker
going
down
but
with
a
very
complex
blend
of
malt

and
root

and

but
the
alcohol

overwhelming
very
well
balanced
has
a
yeasty

taste
found
in
traditional
belgian
abbey
ales
just
a
excellent
well
balanced
beer
i
am
biased
because
abbey
style
ales
are
my
favorite
brews
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
try
this
is
a
world
class
beer
imho
working
off
old
notes
will
update
with
more
details
ifwhen
i

overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
it
had
a
great
flavor
looked
beautiful
had
a
nice
aroma
the
weekest
aspect
i
thought
was
the
mouthfeel
the
beer
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
o
this
is
the
first
abbeystyle
beer
ive
had
ive
never
had
a
trappist
beer
yet
as
well
but
if
this
is
just
a
glimpse
into
what
the
style
is
i
like
it
the
original
from
the
best
belgian
brewery
in
the
country
o
this
might
be
my
favorite
of
the
ommegang
offerings
very
enjoyable
and
reasonably
priced
do
yourself
a
favor
and
let
this
one
warm
up
dont
drink
it
straight
out
of
the
fridge
the
flavor
is
rich
with
prune
and
date
some
crabapple
light
fig
and
a
touch
of
molasses
the
finish
is
just
a
touch
spicy
with
ginger
and
nutmeg
v
medium
value
got
in
large
corked
bottle
sticky
sweet
molasses
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
pours
amber
in
color
with
a
dark
crimson
hue
and
a
foamy
off
white
head
that
retains
nicely
aroma
has
notes
of
figs
dates
and
some
slight
spice
mild
alcohol
and
an
almost
savory
aroma
near
the
end
taste
is
more
phenolic
spice
forward
than
the
nose
notes
of
fig
plum
and
cherry
follow
before
a
big
dry
yeast
and
husky
malt
flavor
finishes
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
highly
carbonated
and
very
dry
o
pit
this
against
any
trappist
or
belgian
brewed
dubbel
in
a
blind
tasting
and
it
will
hold
its
own
just
fine
if
not
take
the
crown
this
is
truly
one
of
the
worlds
best
dubbels
as
i
see
it
great
pairing
with
rich
triple
creme
cheeses
hearty
dishes
like
beef
burgundy
or
even
sticky
desserts
like
fruitcake
or
bread
pudding
this
is
a
landmark
beer
for
americanbrewed
belgian
ales
and
it
set
the
bar
pretty
high
for
everyone
else
overall
really
delicious
i
would
love
to
drink
this
during
christmas
eve
as
it
has
a
lot
of
great
holiday
feel
to
it
outstanding
beer
exactly
what
ive
been
looking
for
dark
brown
pour
strong
at
over
8
but
masked
by
rich
malted
fruit
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
definitely
going
back
for
more
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
l
deep
hazy
amber
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
to
tan
i
have
to
pour
very
slowly
to
prevent
it
from
overflowing
my
snifter
glass
s
nice
fruity
smell
some
yeast
lightly
toasted
bread
figs
t
very
rich
complex
flavor
fruit
and
yeast
flavors
caramel
very
little
bitterness
f
full
body
lots
of
carbonation
alcohol
not
too
strong
o
an
amazing
beer
and
a
less
expensive
way
to
enjoy
a
perfect
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
extremely
delicious
tried
it
with
pizza
maybe
thats
what
threw
me
off
a
little
however
a
dark
well
rounded
beer
smells
great
and
tastes
good
just
a
little
heavy
for
me
and
a
bit
of
a
dull
after
taste
at
8
5
the
price
is
reasonable
and
being
from
the
u
s
its
a
must
try
abbey
ale
is
fantastic
in
the
safest
way
possible
it
looks
beautiful
when
its
poured
its
not
offensive
to
any
senses
and
it
tastes
rich
while
maintaining
a
smooth
finish
i
love
drinking
this
because
it
doesnt
really
have
a
weakness
its
just
good
big
frothy
foamy
head
wildly
carbonated
dark
amber
in
color
aroma
of
super
sweet
malts
yeah
thats
what
it
smells
tastes
like
add
some
caramel
dried
fruits
make
it
super
smooth
warming
full
bodied
noticed
a
little
spice
but
that
seems
to
take
a
back
seat
after
a
few
sips
finishes
dry
like
its
supposed
to
alcohol
strength
doesnt
show
until
later
and
then
it
grabs
you
so
you
grab
another
dang
this
is
good
another
great
one
by
ommegang
o
a
great
american
version
of
the
belgian
classic
loads
of
fruit
with
just
enough
of
that
real
trappist
monk
yeast
punch
o
ommegang
is
one
of
the
best
american
producers
of
belgian
styles
and
this
is
no
exception
straightforward
not
flashy
but
incredibly
flavorful
complex
at
the
same
time
a
phenomenal
beer
a
dubbel
that
would
make
the
monks
proud
real
nice
belgian
abbey
decant
balance
of
sour
dark
fruit
cherry
caramel
and
some
spice
i
dont
love
the
style
so
my
review
should
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
never
the
less
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
at
8
2
has
enough
malt
to
balance
out
the
sourness
great
dubbel
pours
a
bright
copper
color
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
from
the
alcohol
and
the
wheat
the
taste
was
excellent
with
rich
malt
and
bitter
hop
notes
throughout
the
finish
was
also
exceptionally
clean
i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
of
the
sweet
malt
flavors
such
as
banana
and
the
bitter
hops
and
spice
make
this
a
refreshing
beer
any
time
of
year
and
one
of
my
personal
mainstays
this
is
the
first
dubbel
ive
reviewed
and
quite
possibly
the
first
one
ill
have
ever
tried
in
my
life
certainly
the
first
of
its
style
since
ive
become
more
interested
in
craft
beers
and
coincidently
its
also
the
first
beer
that
ommegang
officially
brewed
i
was
going
to
get
a
foreign
dubbel
but
im
much
more
a
fan
of
american
sbeers
at
the
present
time
so
i
chose
the
domestic
route
and
having
seen
plenty
of
good
remarks
about
ommegangs
farmhouse
ale
i
figured
thatd
be
a
decent
choice
for
a
dubbel
also
since
their
specialty
is
belgian
style
brews
it
seemed
fitting
that
they
be
my
brewery
of
choice
in
trying
this
abbey
ale
it
poured
what
seemed
to
be
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
had
an
extremely
vigorous
3
inch
rusty
colored
head
with
some
pretty
decent
sized
bubbles
within
it
the
head
dissipated
rather
quickly
though
leaving
behind
a
touch
of
lacing
and
not
very
much
of
a
cap
but
the
hazy
red
hue
is
a
beautiful
tone
with
quite
a
bit
of
opaqueness
to
it
the
aroma
present
on
the
nose
immediately
is
the
almost
raisiny
malty
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
molasses
and
spice
as
well
as
a
touch
of
breadwheat
in
there
also
a
very
strong
nose
on
this
brew
not
aromatically
challenged
in
the
slightest
the
first
taste
is
full
of
the
dark
berry
sweetness
of
malts
while
the
spiciness
of
the
beer
gently
tiptoes
on
your
palate
as
well
after
a
few
sips
and
letting
the
beer
set
a
moment
as
i
wrote
this
the
licorice
became
more
pronounced
with
the
passing
of
time
the
finish
is
pretty
crisp
and
somewhat
drier
than
the
rest
of
the
beers
elements
this
is
also
where
youll
taste
some
faint
bread
elements
but
the
berry
flavors
are
still
the
most
prominent
the
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
fullness
to
it
with
the
effervescence
giving
it
a
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
pending
this
is
a
good
representation
of
this
style
the
beer
was
crafted
wellwith
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
to
it
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
spice
in
place
of
the
fruitiness
thats
contained
within
this
beer
but
regardless
what
i
would
have
done
its
far
from
a
one
note
song
that
being
said
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
but
that
could
simply
be
that
this
is
mores
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
as
the
flavors
all
worked
well
with
each
other
and
were
in
good
balance
another
good
brew
cheers
overall
its
a
decent
enough
dubbel
if
you
have
that
belgian
abbey
ale
craving
but
it
doesnt
quite
meet
the
mark
when
it
comes
to
some
of
the
more
diverse
flavors
that
are
available
on
the
market
i
wouldnt
say
dont
drink
it
because
is
is
a
lovely
beer
it
just
feels
like
a
beer
that
was
hurried
or
something
i
feel
like
this
beer
must
be
the
benchmark
for
all
american
beer
companies
seeking
to
brew
a
traditional
belgian
dubbel
everything
about
this
beer
is
practically
spot
on
from
the
beautiful
honey
brown
color
and
robust
head
to
the
complex
flavor
and
delicate
mouthfeel
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
overall
this
is
a
bold
and
flavorful
brew
that
isnt
as
decidedly
sweet
as
most
of
its
peers
its
balance
and
gorgeous
presentation
make
it
one
of
my
preferred
dubbels
even
though
it
isnt
an
archetypal
representation
of
the
style
22

and
12

its
this
beers
fault
that
i
really
fell
hard
for
craft
beer
before
that
it
was
something
fun
to
explore
but
now
i
am
hooked
on
the
heavy

stuff
thanks

almost

i
love
this
ale
and
yes
i
am
a
bit
bias
when
it
comes
to
the
abbey
ale
line
up
and
no
doubt
this
a
lead
contender
and
for
me
i
can
fairly
judge
a
beerwine
store
by
its
selection
of
abbey
ales
without
touting
my
love
any
further
this
ale
packs
a
delightful
punch
of
pure
malts
an
instant
salivation

when
the
froth
saturates

ever
hunger

bottle
from

at

although
i
found
this
interesting
but
it
was
not
to
my
liking
way
too
much
going
on
my
first
impression
was
a
slight
sourness
which
unto
itself
was
surprising
the
label
lists
many
flavors
the
only
ones
that
came
through
were
some
licorice
root
deep
on
the
tongue
some
burgundy
notes
rereading
the
ingredients
i
think
i
should
use
this
in
a
daube
de
boeuf
i
will
say
that
the
8
2
abv
was
undetectable
points
for
effort
but
just
not
for
me
not
a
style
i
seek
out
to
much
but
this
one
was
pretty
enjoyable
o
really
a
great
beer
i
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
on
a
really
cold
winter
night
the
spiciness
and
sweetness
of
the
beer
are
really
warming
and
pleasant
overall
a
fantastic
dubbel
style
ale
complex
and
well
balanced
everything
i
could
ask
for
great
beer
ill
definitely
repeat
and
recommend
you
give
it
a
try
believe
it
or
not
this
brew
pairs
perfectly
with
french
toast
flavored
goldfish
then
again
that
could
just
be
the
end

the

leaving

a
wonderful
example

and
one
that
ill
have
to
revisit
often
my
dad
passed
away
a
couple
of
years
ago
he
was
a
very
enthusiastic
fellow
about
many
things
one
of
which
was
fruitcake
yeah
i
know
in
the
fruitcake
family
at
least
the
way
he
made
it
was
pecan
whiskey
cake
even
people
who
hate
fruitcake
loved
his
pecan
whiskey
cake
this
beer
reminds
me
of
that
cake
dark
dried
fruity
accompanied
by
the
pleasant
presence
of
alcohol
etc
whenever
i
drink
this
beer
i
think
of
my
dad
and
his
enthusiasm
for
making
unusual
desserts
very
raisin
dominant
flavor
with
light
sweetness
and
more
bready
notes
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
alcohol
is
noticeable
honestly
i
expected
more
complexity
overall
a
good
beer
with
well
rounded
flavor
id
certainly
try
it
again
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
shaker
pint
this
is
an
excellent
ale
to
drink
and
relax
to
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
overall
a
fantastic
beer
but
not
the
complexity
i
dreamed
about
o
good
but
i
am
not
blown
away
by
it
still
rather
nice
totally
a
standout
belgian
ale
its
both
complex
and
quaffable
overall
great
brew
and
representative
of
the
style
ooverall
a
great
example
of
dubbel
highly
recommend
o
a
decent
brew
thats
rich
and
flavorful
it
just
seems
a
little
unbalanced
for
what
i
truly
want
out
of
the
style
the
spice
character
is
great
theres
just
too
much
of
it
absolutely
worth
a
try
though

i
get

maltdark
belgian
candy
sugar
and
belgian

in
the
flavor
profile
as
the
beer
warms
i
get
a
bit
of
some
nuttiness
and
spices
almost
like
cinnamon
it
seems
out
of
place
here
m
where
the
beer
loses
it
a
bit
as
i
think
its
too
carbonated
notes
from
after
the
fact
i
just
plain
didnt
jive
with
this
beer
the
licorice
ruined
it
for
me
this
beer
came
off
as
tasting
like
root
vegetables
with
potato
and
turnip
the
sweetness
of
the
chocolate
malt
flavor
and
the
twang
of
the
licorice
with
vegetable
notes
just
didnt
go
together
licorice
and
anise
spice
lingered
long
after
there
were
other
redeeming
qualities
like
a
great
body
and
a
nice
porterlike
woodiness
that
i
appreciated
but
i
couldnt
get
past
the
bad
parts
and
im
even
a
fan
of
licorice
an
anise
just
not
in
my
beer
apparently
overy
nice
beer
wish
it
was
in
12ozers
id
be
fine
with
one
of
those
but
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
corked
bottle
anyway
this
is
definitely
ones
of
those
beers
that
improves
as
it
warms
the
bottle
even
lets
you
know
to
serve
it
a
50
degrees
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
us
takes
on
belgians
ales
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
a
complex
but
very
drinkable
beer
just
beware
the
750ml
can
go
down
very
easily
and
the
8
2
abv
can
sneak
up
on
you
quickly
im
so
glad
i
tried
this
othis
beer
went
down
real
fast
i
could
not
just
sip
it
o
just
delicious
an
evening
reading
a
good
book
and
downing
a
bomber
is
blissful
sort
of
a
grape
bomb
little
cough
syrupy
might
be
a
hint
off
doesnt
fail
the
beer
though
is
reminiscent
of
belgians
same
body
bite
yeast
flavors
havent
had
many
ommegangs
had
this
at
a
local
bar
hope
to
see
some
of
their
other
stuff
on
tap
too
terrific
beer
that
i
really
need
to
stop
overlooking
in
the
beer
store
just
because
ive
had
it
before
liquid
bread
or
liquid
fruitcake
this
is
a
good
beer
and
enjoyable
but
very
disappointing
for
me
its
not
up
to
the
standard
im
used
to
from
ommegang
and
its
probably
my
least
favorite
dubbel
from
a
reputable
brewer
o
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
this
is
also
one
of
the
more
expensive
bottles
ive
purchased
in
a
while
and
im
strongly
considering
trying
to
find
a
way
to
get
some
volume
at
a
lower
price
highly
recommend
overall
i
was
pleased
with
ommegangs
take
on
the
dubbel
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
high
and
ultimately
made
this
brew
less
creamy
than
i
would
like
recommended
o
a
great
beer
i
revisit
often
by
an
american
brewery
doing
a
great
version
of
the
belgian
style
just
missing
a
bit
more
crisp
dryness
for
me
to
give
it
world
class
status
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
made
in
usa
will
have
again
well
worth
trying
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
if
you
like
sweet
beers
i
like
it
but
dont
love
it
if
the
sweetness
was
tamped
down
a
bit
and
the
booze
was
better
concealed
this
would
be
better
overall
poured
into
goblet
from
bottle
deep
brown
color
with
lighter
offwhite
head
great
retention
plenty
of
lacing
some
roasty
and
fruity
scents
on
taste
it
feels
full
and
rich
in
the
mouth
withso
many
flavors
that
after
4
of
these
i
still
havent
identified
them
all
theres
sweet
malty
flavors
as
well
as
fruity
and
more
chocolately
ones
everything
is
balanced
and
satisfying
o
an
outstanding
example
of
the
dubbel
style
overall
4
5
it
just
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
folks
its
been
quite
some
time
since
ive
had
a
dubbel
and
this
baby
makes
me
want
to
go
out
and
buy
up
every
bottle
of
ommegang
i
can
find
this
brew
is
smooth
balanced
refined
just
delicious
and
absolutely
no
hint
of
the
8
abv
in
the
taste
highly
recommended
wow
o
way
too
much
like
wine
for
me
plenty
of
the
same
style
i
enjoy
much
more
overall
a
good
american
attempt
at
a
belgian
it
was
6
at
a
grocery
store
so
i
will
certainly
pick
it
up
again
the
lacing
showed
itself
as
we
quaffed
our
beer
with
appetite
and
pleasure
however
the
head
had
nary
a
chance
to
subside
as
we
inhaled
our
ales
with
an
avid
fervor
like
the
way
one
drinks
before
dinner
on
an
empty
stomach
what
a
fine
delicious
beer
this
is
and
with
an
812
abv
cheer
and
clamor
filled
our
living
room
smells
great
tons
of
raisins
sticky
toffee
pudding
brown
sugar
and
a
little
molasses
tastes
like
it
smells
really
fills
out
nicely
theres
lots
of
that
nice
malt
sweetness
with
dark
fruit
flavors
it
does
seem
a
little
bit
over
carbonated
for
my
tastes
but
otherwise
a
fantastic
dubbel
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
some
dubbels
but
didnt
feel
like
shelling
out
for
rochefort
6
this
isnt
quite
as
good
but
it
still
hits
the
spot
and
is
a
fantastic
beer
o
a
nice
and
complex
dubbel
with
a
great
fruitiness
that
carries
depth
in
and
of
itself
the
spices
compliment
the
fruitiness
very
nicely
giving
the
orange
specifically
a
little
more
pop
dangerously
drinkable
for
8
2
and
definitely
recommended
from
a
12oz
bottle
pours
ruby
brown
with
a
huge
rocky
head
that
eventually
dissipates
to
a
nice
lacing
aromas
of
plum
raisin
and
chocolate
flavors
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
dried
fruit
finishes
with
clove
orange
peel
and
chocolate
wonderfully
complex
creamy
but
light
mouthfeel
deceptively
high
in
alcohol
this
drinks
like
a
6
ale
but
is
actually
over
8
abv
this
is
a
delicious
double
i
really
enjoyed
this
o
an
excellent
abbey
dubbel
carbonation
adding
zing
to
the
wellbalanced
malt
and
fruity
yeast
throughout
tasty
and
easydrinking
will
want
to
buy
a
bomber
to
age
o
a
nice
example
of
a
dubbel
i
found
it
a
little
less
fruity
than
some
of
the
belgian
dubbels
but
a
great
drinkable
beer
nonetheless
i
have
to
say
im
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
one
of
the
few
ive
tried
from
ommegang
despite
their
yearround
availability
here
in
albuquerque
this
beer
has
convinced
me
that
ommegang
is
adept
at
making
belgianstyletrappiststyle
beers
and
that
i
should
visit
more
of
their
beers
ommegang
has
done
the
style
well
with
their
abbey
ale
it
poured
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
substantial
head
that
remained
throughout
my
tasting
the
aroma
was
full
of
belgian
yeast
notes
cherries
and
dark
fruits
that
emanated
from
my
glass
as
i
allowed
the
beer
to
warm
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
one
and
many
different
flavors
revealed
themselves
with
each
taste
hints
of
cherries
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
caramel
along
with
a
slight
belgian
yeast
flavor
melded
themselves
with
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
to
create
a
magnificent
tasting
experience
overy
easy
drinking
considering
the
abv
great
representation
of
the
style
and
delicous
very
drinkable
and
overall
one
if
the
best
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
it
feels
more
like
a
belgian
pale
aledubbel
hybrid
than
a
true
dubbel
the
carbonation
dark
fruit
and
malt
complexity
is
lacking
while
this
style
shouldnt
be
a
real
taste
bomb
it
still
has
a
lighter
brighter
character
than
is
typical
such
an
ambitious
head
its
a
bit
hard
to
finish
a
pour
smells
of
caramel
and
a
little
like
my
dog
on
a
good
day
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
swear
i
taste
barbq
in
the
background
i
might
not
seek
out
this
beer
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
refuse
a
glass
deep
brownred
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
complex
fruit
aromas
with
a
layered
sweetness
honey
then
caramel
then
toffee
with
a
hint
of
licorice
and
chocolate
a
big
rich
abbeystyle
ale
that
dries
out
nicely
on
the
finish
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
i
think
that
i
have
had
better
dubbels
i
will
have
to
have
it
again
at
some
point
and
give
it
another
opinion
overall
pretty
good
abbey
ale
but
i
still
prefer
almost
all
of
its
authentic
belgian
counterparts
over
this
still
though
its
a
good
budget
option
if
you
dont
fell
like
shelling
out
a
premium
for
the
belgian
stuff
o
a
very
good
example
of
a
dubbel
fairly
consistent
with
traditional
belgian
styles
the
high
drinkability
combined
with
the
high
alcohol
is
fairly
amazing
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
if
you
said
that
this
was
imported
from
belgium
id
probably
believe
you
ommegang
has
created
a
very
good
very
accurate
version
of
the
belgian
dubbel
recommendable
overall
a
wonderful
concoction
mellow
tasty
and
classic
overall
quite
nice
pretty
much
the
staple
for
american
made
dubbel
that
is
really
well
done
like
one
would
find
in
belgium
o
excellent
example
of
the
belgian
style
dubbel
going
right
back
to
buy
more
o
another
ommegang
another
stellar
beer
abbey
ale
is
complex
super
tasty
and
an
excellent
american
interpretation
of
belgian
styles
exactly
what
you
expect
from
this
brewery
definitely
one
the
better
best
american
dubbels
out
there
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
but
very
good
i
like
bringing
the
750ml
to
family
events
for
sharing
affordable
available
authentic
drinkable
a
good
introduction
for
strong
belgians
methinks
my
favorite
ommegang
creation
a
really
good
and
tasty
example
of
a
dubbel
awesome
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
even
among
belgians
but
i
was
impressed
at
the
execution
the
flavor
of
the
beer
really
shines
through
with
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
not
quite
as
good
this
is
a
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
having
again
poured
into
a
chalice
deep
amberred
burgundy
as
the
bottle
describes
with
a
big
gorgeous
fluffy
tan
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
smell
is
sweet
dark
fruit
raisins
booze
dried
fruit
sweet
bread
and
some
attenuated
belgian
yeast
aroma
taste
is
spicy
big
sweet
malt
with
dark
fruits
cherries
and
raisins
abound
with
spice
notes
from
the
brewing
spices
which
the
bottle
lists
as
coriander
cumin
licorice
star
anise
and
orange
peel
very
carbonated
which
contributes
to
a
huge
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
just
awesome
overall
i
think
the
carbonation
mutes
the
flavors
a
bit
and
i
prefer
three
philosophers
to
this
but
its
a
great
beer
overall
i
much
prefer
tripels
to
dubbels
but
this
is
unquestionably
good
ommegang
has
a
good
record
of
producing
some
fine
ales
not
sure
how
much
longer
i
can
wait
to
open
its
older
brother
now
three
philosophers
high
bborderline
b
great
combination
of
darker
fruits
and
sweet
malts
with
a
lot
more
going
on
besides
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
particularly
the
smell
are
wonderfully
complex
and
very
good
from
start
to
finish
o
a
very
good
belgianstyle
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
was
very
solid
and
enjoyable
not
as
impressed
as
my
first
tasting
amazingly
this
tasted
less
strong
than
it
smelled
and
that
was
a
testament
to
the
strength
of
this
beer
its
easy
to
kick
back
with
a
few
of
these
at
once
even
though
the
alcohol
would
become
apparent
after
a
short
while
the
oily
coating
that
this
left
behind
on
my
mouth
was
so
subtle
and
slick
that
i
could
have
gotten
hooked
on
that
alone
but
theres
a
good
reason
why
this
has
so
many
positive
reviews
on
here
this
was
great
from
start
to
finish
and
worthy
of
its
lofty
rating
on
here
a
musttry
for
any
belgian
beer
lover
and
those
who
doubt
that
an
americanbrewed
offering
can
match
up
with
overseas
counterparts
did
not
score

at
that
time

those
scores
the

overall
this
is
an
excellent

deserving
of
its
place
on
the
beers
of
fame
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
as
soon
as
you
get
the
chance
if
this
is
any
indication
of
what
a
dubbel
can
be
ive
ignored
the
style
for
too
long
ive
had
a
few
within
the
style
but
ommegang
abbey
ale
is
a
thing
of
beauty
o
much
of
my
original
review
stands
although
i
have
expanded
upon
it
a
bit
the
look
has
improved
by
a
point
the
bottle
just
made
the
nice
head
smell
is
bumped
up
possibly
a
nod
to
the
tulip
glass
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
such
a
complex
beer
it
makes
me
picture
a
brewer
in
the
middle
ages
just
tossing
in
anything
he
liked
the
taste
of
with
it
happening
to
turn
out
wonderfully
definitely
will
chase
down
more
from
ommegang
a
fine
alternative
to
beers
that
do
their
talking
with
nothing
but
sharp
hops
a
great
great
beer
prefer
it
over
its
bigger
quad
brother
three
philosophers
i
want
to
compare
it
slightly
to
maudiate
by
unibroue
id
say
the
two
are
relatively
close
in
quality
with
maudiate
winning
on
more
interesting
flavors
the
finish
and
lack
of
alcohol
taste
overall
an
interesting
beer
to
be
sure
to
me
this
beer
taste
more
like
a
german
bock
i
liked
this
beer
but
im
not
quite
sure
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
the
rest
an
excellent
layered
dubble
lot
of
flavors
coming
and
going
keep
it
interesting
and
not
a
hint
of
boozyness
o
even
though
ive
been
drinking
craft
beers
for
years
this
is
my
first
brew
from
ommegang
ive
always
heard
good
things
about
their
beer
and
finally
had
the
opportunity
to
give
it
a
try
i
wasnt
blown
out
of
my
socks
by
this
beer
but
it
was
really
delicious
i
have
a
bottle
of
three
philosophers
that
im
saving
for
the
near
future
o
pretty
good
the
flavors
are
good
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
taste
with
all
if
the
added
spices
overall
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
dubbels
on
the
market
and
the
delicate
nature
of
the
added
spices
brings
lovely
layers
of
complexity
to
what
was
already
a
very
fine
beer
the
flavors
arent
overwhelming
but
nicely
balanced
and
cleverly
subtle
providing
new
nuances
with
every
mouthful
one
of
the
beers
only
weak
points
is
the
massive
level
of
carbonation
ive
had
champagnes
with
fewer
bubbles
than
this
and
the
beer
literally
foams
up
in
the
mouth
and
fills
the
stomach
with
air
had
i
a
second
bottle
i
would
let
it
sit
open
for
a
few
minutes
before
taking
my
first
sip
other
than
that
youre
not
going
to
find
much
better
trappiststyle
ale
anywhere
the
relative
ubiquity
and
value
of
ommegang
make
it
the
rare
beer
thats
both
a
good
introduction
to
a
style
and
one
of
the
best
representations
of
a
style
this
is
a
topnotch
abbey
dubbel
holding
its
own
with
belgian
offerings
while
being
less
expensive
o
very
well
done
and
a
year
round
offering
that
brings
a
taste
of
belgium
from
cooperstown
ive
passed
this
up
on
the
shelf
many
times
and
that
wont
be
the
case
next
time
when
im
in
the
belgian
mood
amazing
red
amber
color
beautiful
great
head
also
sweet
caramel
aroma
sweet
chocolatey
toasted
caramel
taste
with
great
complexity
amazing
flavor
bit
spicy
it
pretty
much
covers
every
facet
you
want
in
a
beer
this
beer
is
just
awesome
one
of
our
favorites
ever
a
friend
hand
carried
these
from
coopers
town
and
i
am
so
very
glad
he
did
odelicious
flavors
and
a
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
overall
very
well
made
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
i
would
order
another
i
would
pair
this
with
some
mild
cheeses
seasonal
fruit
and
i
think
ultimately
it
would
taste
really
good
with
a
fine
cut
of
red
meat
maybe
in
a
peppercorn
sauce
fits
the
style
to
the
tee
makes
me
a
fan
of
this
rich
and
complex
brew
o
very
good
and
recommended
but
not
up
with
the
best
belgians
overall
a
very
tasty
and
complex
ale
beer
is
mediumheavy
in
body
with
mediumintensity
carbonation
that
feels
slightly
aggressive
and
fizzy
upon
the
palate
with
time
though
this
becomes
comfortably
foamy
as
the
carbonation
does
its
trick
softly
moving
across
the
palate
closes
rather
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
solid
good
little
dubbel
o
awesome
dubbel
phenomenal
look
and
smell
and
a
taste
and
feel
that
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
pours
a
crystal
clear
ruby
brown
with
a
huge
tightly
bubbled
beige
head
that
persists
forever
the
aroma
holds
sweet
malts
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
huge
expression
of
what
a
belgian
yeast
strain
can
bring
to
a
beer
bubble
gum
bready
vegemite
with
a
hint
of
pepper
round
out
the
nose
nicely
the
flavor
is
sweet
malts
up
front
with
brown
sugar
toffee
and
a
hint
of
honey
light
dark
fruits
with
all
the
yeastiness
provides
a
great
balance
to
the
sweet
malt
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
the
other
day
o
this
is
a
solid
brew
dubbels
arent
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
drinker
of
a
beer
i
would
return
to
this
beer
if
i
was
in
the
dubbeldubble
mood
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
ommegang
they
have
not
made
a
beer
that
i
hate
but
out
of
their
regular
line
of
beers
this
is
perhaps
my
favorite
they
have
many
others
that
taste
better
but
the
abbey
blends
flavor
drinkability
and
high
alcohol
together
perfectly
overall
i
was
blown
away
by
this
beer
automatically
without
question
on
my
top
5
now
couldnt
believe
i
got
this
for
a
measly
2
29
and
at
8
2
im
feeling
great
tastes
like
a
6
bottle
beer
to
me
time
to
go
back
and
stock
up
on
this
gem
o
this
is
a
great
dubbel
also
affordable
overall
obviously
a
well
crafted
artisanal
belgian
dubbel
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
othis
is
an
impressive
dubbel
unlike
some
dubbels
which
are
fullon
sugar
bombs
this
one
dials
down
the
sweetness
and
lets
the
other
flavors
fruit
and
malt
do
the
talking
i
found
the
flavors
played
nicely
off
of
each
other
and
the
alcohol
really
integrated
into
the
beer
for
a
smooth
drinking
brew
great
dubbel
right
here
note
christy
liked
it
pretty
well
tonight
nice
belgianstyle
ale
a
repeatorder
kind
of
beer
o
excellent
american
representation
of
abbey
style
overallthis
is
a
goto
dubbel
stays
true
to
the
belgium
style
excellent
mouth
feel
floral
aroma
great
taste
without
being
overpowering
probably
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
o
it
is
a
very
good
dubbel
with
sweet
fruit
and
spices
that
are
well
balanced
a
rich
tapestry
of
deep
sweet
aged
flavors
although
this
quaff
is
an
infant
and
fresh
as
the
frigid
buffalo
air
it
is
altogether
familiar
as
something
that
was
always
there
this
is
a
fine
dubbel
decadent
sweet
but
with
a
timeless
underlying
rare
unreproduceable
addictive
flavor
kind
of
like
how
sambuca
romana
is
so
much
more
soulful
and
timeless
than
the
knockoffs
it
compares
favorably
to
gulden
draak
my
favorite
of
alltime
overall
very
tasty
beer
but
atypical
with
the
roast
a
dubbel
that
drinks
like
a
quad
this
sample
was
lightly
oxidized
i
think
o
one
of
the
best
american
made
dubbels
ive
had
and
one
ill
have
again
in
the
future
ommegangs
ability
to
craft
belgian
style
ales
is
unprecedented
to
the
american
craft
beer
enjoyer
and
time
n
time
again
deliver
at
a
top
shelf
rate
this
dubbel
is
no
different
and
after
having
this
i
can
see
why
its
a
flagship
for
belgian
inspired
american
brews
a
delightful
and
well
crafted
dubbel
straight
from
cooperstown
new
york
hats
off
no
sense
equivocating
this
beer
is
excellent
i
find
it
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
such
a
fine
brew
not
too
much
of
anything
that
disagrees
with
me
yet
bold
unashamedly
bold
i
see
that
this
ommegang
abbey
ale
has
been
reviewed
many
times
and
i
hesitate
to
review
one
of
our
fine
beverages
that
so
many
others
have
disected
and
nearly
unanimously
enjoyed
but
this
beer
is
special
a
fine
dubbel
the
flavors
have
hints
of
so
many
real
and
imagined
fine
assets
banana
caramel
molasses
alcohol
even
citrus
its
all
in
there
waiting
to
be
released
and
enjoyed
on
any
given
day
this
beer
can
deserve
a
100
score
but
that
would
be
perfect
and
until
you
try
it
ill
leave
perfection
at
98
and
i
would
be
happy
to
try
again
and
again
and
again
to
find
perfection
but
ommegang
has
found
a
close
fly
by
to
the
magical
elusive
perfection
highly
recommend
its
a
little
scary
how
drinkable
this
is
for
8
2
overall
worldclass
without
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
deliciously
fruity
without
nearing
pungency
a
score
for
anyone
who
loves
a
good
belgian
ale
just
30
minutes
and
it
was
gone
but
im
certain
to
be
back
notes
every
time
i
try
this
beer
my
opinion
of
it
declines
it
comes
up
short
in
so
many
ways
if
you
want
to
drink
an
american
dubbel
drink
pere
jacques
by
goose
island
medium
to
full
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
feels
somewhat
creamy
this
beer
is
so
well
made
it
is
hard
to
criticize
anything
about
it
a
lovely
american
dubbel
it
pours
a
rich
cherrywood
color
with
a
two
inch
tan
head
that
is
fizzy
and
lasting
the
nose
is
quite
yeasty
spiced
and
a
little
sugary
like
candy
there
is
a
ton
of
fruit
in
the
flavor
dried
and
a
little
sweet
but
totally
balanced
by
the
yeast
the
bubbles
and
the
alcohol
this
is
a
really
fun
brew
elegant
and
sassy
finish
is
sweet
but
quick
the
yeast
lasts
on
the
tongue
for
a
bit
this
has
infinite
culinary
potential
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
even
a
little
overcarbonated
its
so
bubbly
i
cant
always
taste
every
bit
of
it
it
doesnt
settle
down
at
all
either
medium
body
and
way
dinkable
for
over
8
abv
like
all
ommegang
beers
this
is
something
special
atmosphere
is
great
frothy
head
and
thick
lacing
nose
is
full
but
a
basic
combination
of
bready
malt
and
tea
leaves
flavor
is
again
basic
but
well
done
light
malt
with
pungent
sweetness
of
raisin
with
a
stronger
tone
of
honey
light
but
full
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
this
was
a
very
good
belgian
double
it
had
plenty
of
sweetness
and
complexity
with
its
fruit
and
licorice
notes
and
the
belgian
yeast
funk
is
fairly
restrained
and
remained
closer
to
bread
or
biscuit
with
only
a
bit
of
funk
i
might
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
but
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
anyway
overall
drinkability
ive
heard
a
lot
of
hype
about
this
beer
and
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
that
said
it
was
stil
a
very
very
good
beer
not
a
worldchanging
beer
but
i
highly
recommend
it
i
like
this
offering
but
not
the
best
ommegang
has
to
offer
and
personally
would
choose
allagashs
dubbel
or
a
true
belgian
or
from
ommegang
hennepin
or
rare
vos
personal
fav
rare
vos
o
another
great
ommegang
offering
right
up
there
behind
three
philosophers
for
me
o
this
is
a
great
beer
great
great
flavor
its
smooth
its
relaxing
its
complex
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
its
awesome
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
malty
flavored
brew
i
drank
this
a
few
years
ago
and
was
memorably
not
impressed
i
guess
i
have
gained
an
appreciation
for
ommegang
in
general
for
i
now
think
this
is
pretty
good
its
not
as
belgian
as
some
examples
of
this
style
but
sometimes
this
is
a
good
thing
this
is
pretty
clean
and
drinkable
although
it
is
a
bit
boozy
great
pour
nice
head
lacing
is
there
the
smell
is
wonderful
taste
is
outstanding
the
malt
and
spices
really
come
through
and
blend
together
perfect
and
the
feel
is
great
a
dry
finish
just
tops
this
beer
off
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
served
from
a
bottle
o
a
rich
complex
dubbel
with
dark
fruit
malt
and
spice
running
the
show
year
ago
this
ommegang
beer
introduced
me
to
the
world
of
flavorful
beers
with
layers
of
flavor
ultimately
saving
me
from
a
life
of
wine
snobbery
overall
very
well
done
for
the
style
o
nice
dubbel
glad
i
finally
took
the
time
to
enjoy
a
bottle
out
of
the
glass
instead
of
drinkin
out
of
12oz
bottles
a
great
beer
smell
is
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
banana
and
nuts
a
bit
spicy
too
typical
of
many
belgians
tastes
boozy
yet
smooth
i
get
dark
fruits
but
also
orange
caramel
and
spices
carbonation
mellows
as
the
beer
warms
overall
a
superb
dubbel
brewed
in
the
belgian
tradition
by
an
american
brewer
overall
this
is
a
good
belgian
dubbel
but
by
no
means
my
favorite
fairly
dark
fruit
forward
with
emerging
alcohol
and
a
strong
yeasty
spice
i
bet
all
these
flavors
would
mellow
out
with
age
but
there
are
also
higher
quality
examples
worthy
of
cellar
space
good
not
great
worth
a
try
to
emerging
fans
of
the
style
for
availability
and
fair
price
point
looks
nice
its
a
bit
heartier
and
spicier
than
i
would
have
guessed
carbonation
seems
a
bit
too
much
really
fairly
smooth
overall
though
i
would
have
anticipated
it
being
a
bit
more
considering
who
made
this
and
who
they
collaborated
with
interesting
to
see
my
perceptions
of
this
beer
now
as
compared
to
so
many
years
ago
smells
a
bit
piney
sharp
and
clean
first
taste
is
fruity
sweet
and
champagnelike
then
hits
your
throat
and
stomach
like
a
fine
whiskey
leaving
a
wonderful
glow
malt
woody
oak
flavors
linger
with
a
honey
sweet
aftertaste
this
is
one
fine
beer
most
highly
recommended
o
one
of
my
all
time
favs
and
for
8
at
the
local
heb
sign
me
up
taste
good
but
i
dont
think
i
really
like
it
its
to
thick
and
syrupy
too
sweet
it
doesnt
work
for
me
o
the
mouthfeel
knocks
this
down
for
me
a
bit
plus
it
didnt
seem
as
cohesive
as
the
westmalle
or
rochefort
however
the
fact
that
im
even
comparing
it
to
those
is
impressive
enough

on

for
my
taste
in
dubbles
but
well
made
and
pleasant
to
drink
medium

the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
heavier
side
of
the
style
with
carbonation
being
high
but
delicate
overall
its
a
great
version
of
the
style
it
comes
together
very
well
and
is
very
flavorful
great
beer
overall
a
classic
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
deep
caramel

dissipates
slowly
leaving
no

a
cap
of
head
retains
forever
and
leaves
some
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
the
beer
has
the
typical
belgian
dubbel
smell
it
has
the
smell
of
dark
candi
sugar
belgian
yeast
malt
and
dark
fruits
the
beer
tastes
like
an
authentic
belgian
dubbel
there
are
the
bready
malts
dark
candi
sugar
dark
fruits
prune
and
raisin
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
that
really
come
through
without
tasting
too
heavy
this
is
superb
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
as
well
the
body
is
full
with
adequate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
dry
in
the
finish
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
the
best
american
made
dubbel
ive
ever
tried
d
i
tried
it
and
enjoyed
it
basically
a
brown
ale
from
belgian
with
more
sweetness

than
hops

coming
through
more
on

there
is
a
pretty
high
amount
of

bitterness
on
the

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
was
not
expecting
the
sour
flavor
and
the
high
spice
bitterness
on
the
finish
however
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
this
is
a
complex
delicious
beer
its
rich
and
full
of
character
with
a
fantastic
malty
flavor
profile
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
o
awesome
appearence
to
this

good

characteristics
nicepleasent

great
complexity
to
its
flavor
o
complex
rich
and
sweet
at
one
point
i
was
thinking
of
dr
pepper
not
a
bad
thing
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
the
malt
profile
is
the
right
amount
and
it
captures
the
belgian
yeast
and
spice
character
you
think
of
for
this
genre
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
on
tap
this
beer
is
wonderful
pours
a
deep
dark
burgundy
color
very
dense
with
visible
particles
throughout
the
head
is
a
dark
khaki
about
2
fingers
and
leaves
delicate
lacing
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
the
highlight
of
this
experience
it
is
full
of
red
licorice
cherries
roasted
malts
and
toffee
i
spent
almost
twenty
full
minutes
just
smelling
the
beer
the
mouthful
was
very
full
with
a
dry
aftertaste
that
really
clears
off
the
palate
the
taste
was
again
lots
of
black
cherry
toffee
very
fruity
estery
and
complex
absolutely
a
beer
to
experience
sad
my
local
bar
tapped
out
of
it
hits
all
the
right
spots
and
hits
them
hard
this
is
one
rich
intense
yet
approachable
dubbel
that
is
huge
on
flavour
in
lieu
of
complexity
worth
going
back
for
more
o
a
very
enjoyable
sipping
beer
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
present
especially
in
the
taste
and
not
as
well
hidden
as
i
hoped
or
expected
there
is
a
very
nice
complexity
to
the
flavor
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
the
blend
of
sweet
and
spice
flavors
i
would
definitely
have
another
overall
i
was
obsessed
with
this
beer
when
i
first
turned
21
i
fell
out
of
love
for
a
good
bit
on
retrying
it
i
can
see
what
i
loved
its
nicely
balanced
and
the
american
spin
with
the
dusting
of
hops
really
makes
it
shine
its
not
the
best
but
damn
if
its
not
tasty
overall
a
really
good
american
take
on
the
belgian
dubbel
nice
complex
fruit
flavors
doa
it
is
medium
bodied
and
modestly
carbonated
not
a
bad
dubbel
it
has
lots
of
stuff
going
on
in
it
that
brings
out
different
dimensions
instead
of
just
yeast
and
malt
i
liked
it
but
i
think
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
take
over
this
if
given
a
choice
worth
a
try
for
sure
if
you
havent
had
it
this
ale
is
slick
on
the
palate
moderately
carbonated
and
a
delight
to
drink
if
you
enjoy
this
style
of
ale
then
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
smooth
flavor
full
mouth
not
too
biting
certainly
malty
with
a
hint
of
cream
in
the
head
a
dark
beer
that
definitely
pairs
well
with
roasted
meats
and
some
hearty
starches
original
review
on
07232010
o
a
tasty
full
flavoured
dubbel
with
loads
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
subtle
complexities
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
a
job
well
done
on
ommegangs
part
i
havent
really
had
to
sit
and
think
about
a
beer
like
this
one
in
a
while
looking
forward
to
my
next
one
all
i
can
say
is
just
try
it
for
yourself
you
wont
be
disappointed
o
a
complex
lovely
beer
i
love
the
way
it
hits
with
that
initial
stroke
of
lightness
only
to
slowly
let
in
a
wave
of
darkness
it
takes
a
special
kind
of
brewer
to
achieve
something
like
that
quite
simply
this
dubbel
is
really
oneofakind
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
not
even
big
on
belgian
styles
for
6
99
a
750ml
its
affordable
too
o
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
at
times
but
definitely
tasty
i
cant
believe
this
stuff
is
made
in
new
york
if
i
hadnt
known
better
id
almost
swear
it
was
belgian
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
as
good
as
3
philosophers
plus
its
cheaper
my
only
knock
on
it
is
that
theres
a
fair
amount
of
tartness
in
the
flavor
and
i
wish
it
was
just
a
little
bit
sweeter
o
a
great
example
of
what
an
abbey
ale
should
be
othis
is
very
well
balanced
beer
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
lacks
a
bit
on
the
smell
but
besides
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
really
enjoyed
this
this
really
hit
the
spot
today
after
taking
four
midterms
in
less
than
48
hours
kicking
off
spring
break
with
a
damn
fine
brew
like
this
is
just
what
i
needed
cheers
beautiful
color
and
great
tan
head
smell
of
carmel
malts
and
the
belgian
yeast
didnt
get
much
of
a
clove
smell
taste
of
toffee
carmel
and
a
little
chocolate
o
such
a
great
dubbel
delivers
time
time
again
smooth
but
bubbly
mouthfeel
and
a
crisp
finish
with
lingering
caramel
sweetness
and
red
fruit
notes
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
much
more
fruitiness
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
marries
well
with
the
caramel
and
malt
notes
never
had
a
beer
like
this
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
o
for
the
price
point
this
is
essential
belgianstyle
coolweather
drinking
made
in
the
usa
will
certainly
continue
buying
o
a
very
good
very
rich
belgianstyle
beer
thats
very
smooth
and
drinkable
despite
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
o
i
expected
something
a
little
sweeter
but
this
is
still
a
good
dubbel
with
so
many
good
beers
we
enjoyed
that
night
abbey
ale
the
one
that
started
it
all
might
be
our
handsdown
favorite
pouring
a
deep
ruby
almost
mahogany
this
brew
features
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
decent
lacing
a
powerful
bouquet
of
dark
fruit
figs
plums
and
raisins
mixes
with
licorice
and
chocolate
hints
all
sorts
of
flavors
erupt
on
the
pallet
including
belgian
candi
sugar
fig
honey
licorice
and
more
dark
fruits
this
amazing
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
a
somewhat
mediumlight
level
of
carbonation
simply
amazing
overall
this
is
certainly
a
world
class
beer
i
bought
tis
on
a
whim
at
my
local
bottle
shop
and
i
must
say
i
made
quite
the
find
will
buy
again
overall
quite
a
flavorful
and
drinkable
beer
very
reasonable
pricing
in
ny
state
have
always
been
an
ommegang
fan
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
hasnt
tried
it
before
pours
a
nice
ruddy
brown
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
it
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
like
molasses
with
some
dark
fruit
mixed
in
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
but
in
my
opinion
its
overpowering
both
in
smell
and
taste
this
is
the
first
world
class
beer
ive
had
that
i
dont
want
to
finish
i
might
even
need
an
adjunct
lager
to
help
rinse
the
rancid
taste
out
of
my
mouth
im
sure
this
is
a
quality
ale
brewed
with
top
ingredients
but
i
would
never
consider
buying
this
again
and
i
dont
recommend
it
to
any
of
my
friends
ommegang
abbey
ale
22oz
bomber
this
beer
has
a
very
dark
near
black
body
and
be
careful
when
pouring
because
is
grows
a
massive
head
tulip
glasses
not
recommended
go
for
a
goblet
shape
the
aroma
is
powerful
and
mirrors
the
taste
the
ommegang
bowls
you
over
with
flavor
of
burnt
sugar
and
oxidized
wine
no
subtle
mix
of
complex
flavors
here
overall
i
did
not
like
the
flavors
of
this
dubbel
and
i
would
prefer
a
more
subtle
presentation
the
ommegang
is
worth
a
try
to
experience
how
intense
a
dubbel
can
be
but
i
will
not
repeat
as
there
are
other
offerings
which
provide
a
more
subtle
array
of
flavors
to
the
palate
b
nicely
done
overall
but
a
bit
too
smooth
and
restrained
for
me
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
brew
it
has
great
belgian
style
qualities
and
is
one
nice
dubble
the
beer
is
crimson
colored
with
an
inch
of
lasting
beige
head
the
aroma
brings
toffee
fruit
cherries
yeast
malt
the
flavor
offers
a
sweet
fruity
yeasty
character
with
cherries
atop
a
malty
base
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
really
smooth
on
the
palate
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
even
with
only
a
upper
moderate
level
of
alcohol
this
is
closer
to
a
sipper
with
all
the
complexity
and
the
richness
ill
take
my
time
and
enjoy
this
among
the
best
dubbels
ive
had
so
far
and
ill
be
trying
two
st
bs
in
the
next
week
this
beer
was
a
top
choice
at
a
lake
restaurant
i
visited
one
evening
the
color
of
this
beer
was
a
beautiful
dark
gold
color
the
smell
was
just
as
appealing
as
the
color
with
cream
and
sweet
aromas
and
the
taste
is
about
the
same
as
the
smell
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
insane
creaminess
and
the
warming
fruit
qualities
to
the
taste
the
beer
was
also
very
yeasty
which
helped
to
downplay
the
sugars
and
make
this
a
nononsense
dubble
much
in
the
same
way
as
chimay
red
this
beer
stays
true
to
the
style
hitting
all
the
high
points
along
the
way
so
i
have
just
got
to
say
wow
impressive
drink
o
i
definitely
appreciated
this
beer
it
was
the
last
of
the
ommegang
mixed
pack
that
i
tried
and
it
definitely
lived
up
to
the
rest
it
was
nice
and
smooth
and
a
nice
level
of
sweetness
o
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
slightly
high
alcohol
content
rich
burgundywine
aroma
the
alcohol
definitely
there
raspberryred
color
a
little
like
a
nice
scotch
and
mediumlow
head
strong
honey
sweetness
on
the
nose
alcohol
rather
smooth
muted
burnt
caramel
a
bit
of
raspberry
fruitiness
richness
lingers
on
the
tongue
opens
up
a
lot
more
with
warming
definitely
a
solid
dubbel
o
an
excellent
beer
absolutely
one
worth
trying
and
i
will
defiantly
recommend
this
beer
to
others
overall
such
a
classy
well
brewed
craft
love
pairing
this
with
meats
and
love
cooking
with
it
as
well
strongly
reccommend
great
brew
as
majority
of
ommegang
beers
are
reccommendation
if
you
ever
try
this
at
the
brewery
take
a
sip
grab
a
piece
of
the
licorice
root
and
chew
on
it
until
the
sugars
release
and
take
another
sip
the
flavor
it
brings
out
is
incredible
overall
a
fine
expample
of
a
belgium
abby
style
even
though
it
is
brewed
in
the
heart
of
ny
state
a
very
nice
and
approachable
belgiun
beer
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
and
again
o
4
5
overall
this
is
the
final
beer
in
the
four
pack
of
this
brewerys
gift
pack
i
bought
back
in
august
while
we
were
moving
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
after
the
patriots
win
tonight
very
scary
that
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
i
love
when
a
beer
can
do
that
nice
rich
and
smooth
the
aroma
is
amazing
though
the
taste
is
less
balanced
too
much
alcohol
and
the
flavours
dont
blend
perfectly
nonetheless
an
impressive
and
tasty
dubbel
that
is
well
worth
seeking
out
o
really
good
offering
overall
i
could
definitely
go
for
a
few
of
these
it
has
a
very
nice
level
of
sweetness
and
tons
of
flavor
if
you
enjoy
a
fruity
sweet
belgian
ale
try
it
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
is
a
little
frightening
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
even
at
greater
than
8
abv
although
the
alcohol
does
provide
a
nice
warmth
to
the
beer
i
also
enjoyed
how
balanced
the
beer
was
in
the
way
that
it
presented
its
malt
profile
bronzyrubyish
appearance
with
a
thick
head
dark
fruits
plums
raisins
in
the
aroma
and
taste
you
cant
taste
the
8
5
at
all
the
dry
finish
is
excellent
this
beer
is
the
beer
that
made
me
start
looking
at
belgians
more
than
i
had
been
drinkability
subtle
smooth
and
very
tasty
it
is
solid
stuff
i
was
not
that
impressed
with
a
couple
other
ommegang
brews
but
this
is
good
stuff
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
one
that
i
will
keep
coming
back
to
again
and
again
flavor
is
out
of
this
world
good
on
par
with
all
the
belgian
greats
cellaring
some
12oz
bottles
of
this
will
rewrite
review
when
enjoyed
overall
impression
a
highly
drinkable
complex
dubbel
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
that
has
all
the
classic
elements
of
a
belgian
dubbel
seek
out
poured
from
a
brown
25
4
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
bronze
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
fruits
taste
is
very
good
lots
of
dark
fruits
alcohol
is
well
hidden
yeast
with
lots
of
flavor
scary
how
easy
drinking
this
is
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
top
notch
beer
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
filling
and
that
dark
fruitprune
flavour
is
quite
strong
check
it
out
if
you
like
that
kind
of
thing
but
if
you
dont
be
aware
that
it
is
prominent
o
very
nice
dubbel
a
great
representative
of
the
style
i
will
buy
this
again
thank
god
for
wegmans
pa
residents
know
what
i
am
talking
about
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
making
brewery
i
really
enjoyed
discovering
this
label
after
moving
to
new
jersey
i
recommend
all
of
their
offerings
o
very
good
beer
have
not
had
many
dubbells
but
this
is
a
very
good
effort
very
complex
and
unique
very
rich
dark
amber
color
one
fingered
tan
head
smells
like
ripe
pears
and
light
bit
of
banana
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
little
chocolate
and
some
ripe
plums
there
is
a
light
bitter
finish
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
think
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
would
definitely
buy
again
an
exceptional
dubbel
as
authentic
as
youll
get
them
in
belgium
although
far
cheaper
in
the
us
if
aging
the
beer
like
i
accidentally
did
makes
it
more
creamy
and
smooth
rather
than
bitter
and
allows
it
to
better
reveal
the
roasted
notes
i
recommend
a
shot
far
from
my
personal
favorite
of
the
style
but
still
pretty
great
overall
i
liked
this
brew
im
far
from
familiar
with
belgian
styles
and
i
havent
had
many
dubbles
and
i
must
admit
that
they
are
not
my
favorite
this
is
however
a
very
flavorful
and
complex
brew
that
is
clean
and
easy
to
drink
recommended
to
any
ba
looking
to
get
into
darker
belgian
ales
cheers
pours
a
twofinger
cream

that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace

color
good

saco
me
this
abbey
is
banging
certainly
among
my
favorite
beers
around
i
also
said
that
about
rare
vos
coincidence
overall
i
enjoyed
the
pere
jacques
a
surprising
amount
and
decided
to
revisit
the
dubbel
i
was
once
again
somewhat
disappointed
by
the
style
its
still
tasty
but
never
seems
to
be
what
im
looking
for
out
of
a
beer
am
i
not
drinking
good
dubbels
or
are
they
just
not
that
good
highly
recommended
just
make
sure
to
allow
this
beer
to
warm
properly
before
enjoying
not
my
personal
choice
of
style
but
a
world
class
example
thereof
overall
an
okay
dubbel
but
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
the
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
but
a
feeling
of
tannins
leaving
it
dryer
overall
its
outstanding
but
i
would
put
it
a
notch
below
similar
offerings
from
true
trappist
breweries
overall
great
beer
hard
to
believe
its
so
high
in
abv
but
the
malt
and
yeast
notes
keep
it
interesting
drinkability
this
is
definitely
an
easydrinking
repeatable
beer
though
i
wouldnt
recommend
more
than
two
unless
you
have
a
designated
driver
id
buy
it
again
serve
it
to
my
friends
entertain
with
it
anything
to
drink
more
complex
and
creamy
its
a
fruitymalty
hybrid
and
a
nice
exemplar
of
a
belgian
dubbel
a
big
dark
beige
head
made
up
of
large
bubbles
falls
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
of
a
clear
dark
mahogany
brown
beer
with
red
highlights
the
smell
is
of
dark
fruit
spices
and
a
bit
of
molasses
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
fruits
and
caramels
coming
through
fairly
strong
with
a
lot
of
yeast
character
in
there
as
well
bitterness
is
relatively
low
while
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
with
a
fine
dry
finish
overall
its
a
good
dubbel
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
o
a
very
pleasant
dubbel
i
really
enjoyed
it
very
refined
and
not
trying
to
get
crazy
or
aggressive
very
hard
to
tell
that
this
is
8
5
in
fact
i
would
have
guessed
it
around
6
a
testament
to
how
refined
this
is
o
nice
beer
becoming
a
big
fan
of
quads
so
the
dubbel
style
is
a
bit
underwhelming
but
this
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
to
imbibe
good
slow
sipper
to
enjoy
as
it
warms
would
recommend
to
someone
wanting
to
sample
a
good
representation
of
a
domestic
belgian
style
brew
do
another
exceptional
offering
from
ommegang
my
favorite
belgianstyle
brewery
here
in
america
rather
enjoyable
and
repeatable
not
their
strongest
offering
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
o
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
overall
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
ommegang
abbey
ale
and
honestly
can
only
think
of
one
other
dubbel
which
might
have
a
slight
edge
regardless
ommegang
abbey
ale
is
in
a
class
o
its
own
take
it
for
what
it
is
but
dont
take
it
for
granted
overall
this
is
gem
that
will
always
be
a
regular
on
my
list
of
top
beers
and
enjoyed
time
and
time
again
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
the
cherry
flavor
is
what
gets
me
every
time
with
the
perfect
balance
of
hops
the
color
is
also
one
of
my
favorites
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
a
couple
of
times
but
i
think
that
it
is
best
served
poured
from
the
bottle
in
a
low
baller
glass
o
not
bad
i
wish
the
smell
was
a
bit
more
elaborate
but
still
a
fine
ale
what
complements
this
beer
why
santanas
abraxas
just
look
at
the
album
art
thats
enough
this
is
not
just
beer
but
a
dark
beautiful
sexual
experience
i
prefer
a
slightly
sturdier
ale
feel
so
would
normally
lean
towards
a
straight
ahead
dark
ale
but
this
beer
makes
a
fine
autumn
seasonal
for
me
this
is
what
a
harvest
ale
should
be
imho
o
no
wonder
its
so
wellliked
a
truly
delicious
beer
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
but
unlike
most
of
the
bigger
maltier
beers
doesnt
have
that
terrible
sweet
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
too
long
good
beer
o
so
much
occurring
within
the
aroma
and
taste
alcohol
is
fairly
present
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
at
all
solid
beer
o
this
might
be
pretty
close
to
an
ideal
somewhat
sweet
and
yeasty
dubbel
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
unless
you
like
life
sour
and
bitter
o
very
tasty
it
is
not
overly
complex
heavy
alcoholic
sweet
or
bitter
overall
a
well
balanced
dubbel
i
like
some
dubbels
better
than
this
but
i
do
like
this
one
more
than
a
lot
of
others
o
one
of
the
better
dubbels
out
there
great
all
around
a
nice
beer
with
an
enough
of
a
slight
complexity
to
be
interesting
however
it
feels
just
a
smig
on
the
thin
side
and
lacks
the
omfah
of
other
dubbels
ive
had
it
the
past
i
think
that
it
would
pair
well
with
food
though
offering
enough
of
an
alcohol
presence
and
robust
flavor
profile
to
hold
its
own
mouthfeel
is
medium
smooth
brew
that
goes
down
easily
and
keeps
moderate
carbonation
i
like
having
this
one
from
time
to
time
i
really
enjoy
it
in
colder
weather
o
my
first
time
having
this
beer
and
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
it
again
i
will
have
to
enjoy
this
one
with
someone
that
has
a
better
palate
than
i
do
to
explain
the
complexities
im
tasting
in
this
beer
i
ate
dinner
with
some
family
on
saturday
night
at
the
elephant
walk
in
brookline
and
was
surprised
to
see
a
decent
draft
lineup
here
i
started
with
an
abbey
ale
it
was
served
in
an
ommegangbranded
stemmed
tulip
glass
dark
brown
color
with
a
slim
white
head
on
top
aroma
was
rich
with
cherry
plum
and
red
licorice
taste
was
also
quite
delicious
ripe
dark
fruit
really
stood
out
as
potent
flavors
it
was
also
sweet
at
the
end
like
they
used
belgian
sugar
to
brew
mouthfeel
was
a
slight
bit
hot
from
the
alcohol
at
the
end
of
the
sip
this
is
a
surprisingly
boozy
beer
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
the
ommegang
dubbel
and
i
almost
forgot
just
how
good
it
really
is
d
an
exceptional
tasting
beer
it
has
good
drinkability
though
the
high
alcohol
and
complex
taste
makes
this
a
perfect
sipper
really
impressed
with
this
one
d
this
is
a
real
treat
one
of
the
most
well
balanced
beers
relative
to
the
style
ive
encountered
so
much
flavor
going
on
yet
not
one
characteristic
tries
to
outshine
another
letting
the
pallet
experience
multiple
sensations
on
the
taste
buds
as
one
swishes
the
fluid
around
overall
4
5
great
looking
beer
emulated
the
dubbel
trappist
style
beautifully
the
lacing
was
fantastic
despite
being
an
abby
ale
and
generally
complex
ommegang
achieves
an
amazing
drinkability
while
still
keeping
complex
characteristics
a
definite
must
purchase
again
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
color
a
deep
dark
brown
with
golden
accents
the
head
is
nice
but
a
little
bubbly
the
smell
is
lacking
the
beer
is
not
particularly
hoppy
carbonation
is
a
little
flat
the
beer
is
in
it
for
the
finish
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
well
worth
the
buy
quite
a
nice
dubbel
this
is
a
very
well
done
dubbel
from
an
american
brewery
its
a
little
more
carbonated
than
i
would
like
but
it
makes
up
for
that
in
appearance
and
the
perfect
bready
notes
overall
been
wanting
to
try
this
since
it
came
to
louisiana
love
it
complex
and
creamy
a
very
fruitymalty
hybrid
that
warms
the
soul
ommegang
does
belgian
right
good
brew
i
would
almost
believe
it
were
european
highly
recommended
i
guess
thats
why
the
label
proclaims
true
belgian
dubbel
an
agreeable
enough
crossatlantic
effort
the
belgian
character
terroir
whatever
gives
this
some
decent
complexity
though
not
overly
so
drinkable
until
the
toosubtle
spicing
gives
way
to
the
burgeoning
heat
but
that
takes
a
while
and
this
is
indeed
a
generous
bottle
that
i
paid
for
once
and
seemingly
will
do
so
again
o
a
bit
of
a
let
down
expected
a
lot
more
form
this
beer
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
and
thought
that
the
carbonation
as
a
bit
high
m
this
beer
is
sweet
and
dry
at
the
same
time
with
the
warmth
of
alcohol
it
is
nicely
carbonated
that
will
not
go
unnoticed
a
good
tasting
beer
solid
for
the
style
convenient
in
the
12
oz
for
those
weeknights
o
great
beer
that
very
easy
to
find
not
something
i
would
want
to
get
every
day
but
a
nice
dubbel
nonetheless
definitely
one
of
their
better
beers
and
worth
the
try
appearance
is
a
murky
dark
burnt
orange
color
beneath
a
modest
eggshell
head
nice
dark
fruit
scents
come
through
strongly
upon
opening
the
bottle
dark
fruit
flavors
continue
through
the
taste
plum
raisin
along
with
caramel
malt
and
maybe
a
slight
coffee
taste
as
well
carbonation
seemed
very
high
more
than
i
like
and
the
finish
was
quite
dry
almost
like
drinking
a
sparkling
wine
enjoyable
but
not
quite
at
the
level
of
some
other
trappist
brews
yet
another
great
addition
to
the
shelves
here
in
alberta
im
pretty
stoked
i
have
several
ommegang
left
to
try
its
a
slightly
hazy
abbey
ale
gorgeous
red
in
color
with
a
tannish
white
head
that
sits
for
a
little
bit
then
disappears
the
flavor
is
all
in
the
yeast
these
suckers
poop
out
the
most
delicious
esters
you
will
ever
taste
and
the
soft
pallet
of
malt
and
hops
lends
beautifully
to
this
symphony
of
beer
deliciousness
light
enough
in
body
to
kick
a
few
back
and
stumble
to
the
bathroom
from
your
barstool
but
flavorful
enough
to
make
you
want
to
order
more
try
this
one
on
tap
somewher
near
you
or
me
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
but
cant
quite
compete
with
some
of
the
more
traditional
belgian
dubbelsquads
o
not
my
favorite
but
good
for
the
style
thankfully
not
super
sweet
but
it
wasnt
the
most
complex
ommegang
abbey
is
a
great
beer
for
sure
but
i
admit
i
dont
quite
understand
all
the
a
grades
thank
you
ommegang
this
is
a
good
brew
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
maturing
to
really
get
the
full
potential
out
of
it
as
it
warms
an
intense
dark
fruit
plum
skins
and
figs
mostly
loved
it
great
flavor
another
very
nice
beer
in
the
ommegang
family
a
nice
cloudy
brown
with
a
lasting
tan
head
on
the
pour
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
some
dark
fruit
raisins
plums
dates
taste
is
sweet
malt
raisins
dark
plums
dates
and
light
hops
a
nice
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
on
the
palate
finish
is
sweet
malt
some
yeast
dark
fruit
plums
a
light
toffee
raisins
and
dates
with
some
light
hops
for
balance
overall
a
very
nice
tasty
and
flavorful
brew
pours
a
hazy
ruby
color
with
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
i
notice
slight
taste
of
cherries
along
with
the
caramel
malt
and
yeast
unique
mouthfeel
it
was
creamy
and
thin
at
the
same
time
hard
to
explain
this
is
a
very
good
beer
worth
trying
overall
i
love
it
exceptional
beer
that
i
will
definitely
have
again
and
reflect
more
on
what
it
offers
od
its
a
solid
beer
all
the
way
through
but
just
gets
rather
boring
at
times
and
the
flavors
become
monotonous
i
have
found
my
new
standby
beer
oa
decent
dubbel
i
personally
felt
as
if
clove
and
banana
flavors
work
better
within
the
style
overall
this
is
a
superb
beer
though
a
little
stronger
flavor
and
aroma
would
make
it
still
better
i
only
wish
it
were
readily
available
in
12oz
bottles
around
here
o
a
suprisingly
great
domestic
dubbel
from
a
brewery
that
makes
solid
belgain
crafted
ales
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
the
appearance
is
fantastic
and
both
the
nose
and
taste
are
great
this
beer
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
considering
the
thicker
body
but
it
does
not
detract
from
this
beer
much
prost
o
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
provided
you
can
get
through
the
sweetness
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
belgian
dubbel
pored
a
nice
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
head
retention
was
average
and
it
produced
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
full
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
prunes
the
taste
of
this
ale
has
a
strong
malt
base
it
is
sweet
creamy
and
has
a
raisiny
and
spicy
notes
the
beer
was
sweet
from
start
to
finish
awesome
beer
best
american
version
of
a
belgian
dubbel
that
i
have
tasted
thus
far
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brown
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
mixed
in
the
beer
smells
about
like
a
i
expect
a
dubbel
to
smell
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
some
dark
fruit
mainly
cherries
and
plums
as
well
some
belgian
yeast
and
some
brown
candy
sugar
notes
there
is
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
noticeable
but
the
beer
is
still
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
americanmade
dubbel
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
this
demonstrates
why
i
should
be
getting
more
into
this
style
ever
belgian
style
dubbel
ive
had
has
been
really
good
but
this
may
take
the
cake
over
all
of
them
i
will
definitely
be
checking
out
more
in
this
style
and
i
owe
a
lot
of
that
to
this
beer
o
very
complex
a
bit
hot
but
some
aging
would
solve
this
worth
a
try
o
overall
im
surprised
im
reviewing
this
because
its
so
common
around
me
i
take
it
for
granted
all
of
ommegangs
beers
are
solid
im
fortunate
to
live
so
close
to
them
drink
overall
a
good
dubbel
nice
big
fruits
and
yeast
balanced
and
tasty
would
like
another
bottle
overall
a
solid
dubbel
i
would
have
this
again
this
beauty
appears
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
perhaps
mahogany
or
the
color
of
maple
sap
under
a
creamy
and
fully
committed
head
a
generously
deep
bouquet
of
toasted
candied
maple
brown
sugar
and
caramel
cookies
with
notes
of
ginger
and
raisin
fills
the
nose
body
is
a
full
yet
relatively
smooth
one
the
maltcentric
taste
notes
here
are
very
much
foretold
by
the
aroma
but
do
finish
differently
with
a
more
herbal
and
earthy
tone
than
the
expected
fully
sweet
one
with
its
ending
carbonation
the
finish
is
also
slightly
reminiscent
to
that
of
the
caramelnoted
cola
finish
in
a
soda
pours
a
cloudy
brown
very
big
head
that
settles
out
nicely
light
lace
pleasant
fruity
nose
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
so
much
going
on
its
hard
to
find
a
place
to
start
dark
fruits
soaked
in
a
alcohol
base
cloves
black
pepper
dark
sugar
malty
spicy
sweet
boozy
something
subtle
and
new
with
each
sip
smooth
light
to
medium
body
and
carbonation
holds
well
buy
it
try
it
you
will
like
it
m
carbonation
is
a
delight
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
pours
a
reddish
mahogany
color
with
a
fizzy
pinkishbeige
head
that
is
thin
despite
a
vigorous
pour
the
aroma
has
a
wonderfully
fragrant
combination
of
wine
grapes
candied
plums
and
dark
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
likewise
rich
and
complex
with
notes
of
leather
rumsoaked
cherries
raisins
brown
sugar
and
some
deep
underlying
earthiness
the
fine
active
carbonation
creates
a
texture
that
is
both
prickly
and
creamy
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
features
rich
flavors
without
being
syrupy
or
otherwise
heavy
o
not
bad
i
think
dubbels
just
arent
my
thing
theyre
not
quite
red
wine
but
they
seem
to
haunt
the
same
neighborhood
and
i
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
a
red
i
wouldnt
try
this
again
unless
i
had
the
right
food
to
pair
it
with
o
this
beer
isnt
my
favorite
from
the
guys
at
ommegang
its
high
notes
are
the
texture
look
and
smell
its
low
points
come
from
the
taste
which
might
be
skewed
by
light
exposure
i
will
find
another
one
of
these
beers
and
update
if
anything
changes
at
a
later
date
this
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
there
is
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
with
fruity
esters
and
a
nice
belgian
spiceness
is
present
as
well
its
really
a
perfect
balance
between
the
two
the
flavor
is
very
full
and
again
there
is
a
perfect
harmonious
balance
between
the
the
sweet
dark
fruit
flavors
and
the
spiceyness
from
the
belgian
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
for
the
style
and
overall
this
is
the
best
dubbel
i
have
ever
had
ommegang
knows
their
shit
d
pretty
big
dubbel
but
very
wellmade
gorgeous
looking
beer
follows
with
a
delightful
smell
and
taste
overall
a
really
nice
beer
and
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
find
dubbels
are
occasionally
too
sweet
and
this
one
is
not
really
enjoyable
this
is
a
really
good
beer
its
pretty
mild
for
a
dubbel
good
abv
thats
balanced
very
well
with
the
fruitiness
and
creaminess
glad
ive
got
a
couple
more
of
these
o
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
apparent
but
this
is
not
a
boozy
beer
o
this
beer
is
super
close
to
being
world
class
it
falls
just
a
notch
short
in
a
couple
categories
definitely
recommended
pickup
though
its
worth
drinking
again
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
cheers
overall
drinkability
good
beer
session
abbey
for
taste
and
price
d
4
this
is
a
fine
ale
and
im
hardly
surprised
given
the
brewery
ommegang
always
seems
to
be
solid
this
is
a
good
one
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
for
sure
it
packs
a
great
punch
of
aroma
and
flavor
and
isnt
all
that
heavy
at
its
abv
it
will
get
you
where
you
need
to
be
so
you
wont
need
a
whole
lot
its
nice
to
have
this
brew
readily
available
to
fall
back
on
occasion
overall
a
great
beer
has
a
nice
medium
body
with
some
great
flavor
and
aroma
combinations
would
definitely
recommend
o
a
very
complex
belgian
style
dubbel
just
the
right
flavors
play
throughout
the
whole
beer
this
is
absolutely
delicious
and
about
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
a
trappist
dubbel
smiley
face
overall
ommegang
rarely
disappoints
the
flavours
were
really
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
after
each
sip
i
kept
wanting
more
and
more
definitely
worth
seeking
out
pours
an
orange
tinted
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
cap
of
offwhite
cream
gone
quickly
scent
is
a
blend
of
brown
sugar
plum
raisin
with
touches
of
citrus
mellon
and
banana
a
lot
going
on
here
taste
mimics
scent
with
all
of
those
different
notes
going
on
it
was
really
hard
to
appreciate
as
it
came
off
as
unfocused
body
is
fuller
side
of
medium
creamy
but
with
highly
active
carbonation
lingering
burnt
sugar
and
alcohol
flavors
on
the
tongue
a
good
beer
just
a
little
too
much
going
on
and
it
never
comes
together
like
others
in
the
style
in
the
top
running
for
the
american
made
dubbel
very
complex
fruit
aromas
and
flavors
excellent
mouthfeel
as
well
a
go
to
dubbel
for
sure
overall
well
brewed
with
prounounced
elements
throughout
delightful
to
enjoy
be
wary
of
the
yeast
though
one
of
the
better
american
belgians
i
have
had
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
but
it
still
drinks
very
nicely
o
this
is
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
the
real
thing
it
looks
smells
tastes
and
feels
like
a
real
belgian
dubbel
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
and
will
be
coming
back
to
this
one
o
ommegang
really
outdoes
themselves
for
the
price
it
is
quite
satisfying
tastes
just
a
beautiful
as
it
looks
really
great
carbonation
that
just
gets
better
as
you
get
closer
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
is
a
delicious
version
of
a
style
thats
never
been
my
favorite
o
i
could
really
take
or
leave
this
one
its
far
from
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
and
it
is
imo
more
sweet
and
one
dimensional
with
the
sweetness
level
normallly
i
prefer
sweeter
beers
but
i
have
to
say
this
is
superb
a
well
matured
yet
light
dubbel
nice
raisin
flavours
d
drinkability
is
superb
on
this
puppy
rich
and
delicious
o
very
tasty
ive
had
three
philosophers
before
and
this
easily
proves
that
ommegang
isnt
a
one
beer
brewerynot
that
i
thought
they
were
definitely
makes
me
want
to
move
closer
to
cooperstown
to
be
able
to
get
their
brews
at
a
slightly
better
price
omy
favorite
beer
from
ommegang
this
one
matches
up
with
any
of
the
great
dubbels
out
there
the
alcohol
isnt
perfectly
hidden
i
guess
thats
my
biggest
knock
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
overall
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
pours
a
slightly
hazy
apple
cider
like
brown
color
with
hints
of
red
tinge
to
the
edges
there
is
a
big
off
white
almost
khaki
colored
head
the
head
is
frothy
and
just
about
four
fingers
in
size
the
head
stays
around
at
about
one
finger
and
leaves
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
candy
very
sweet
and
inviting
with
a
slight
earthiness
at
the
very
back
end
very
strong
aroma
that
you
can
smell
as
you
come
close
to
the
glass
the
taste
follows
suit
there
is
a
sweet
malt
backbone
with
a
very
nice
candy
yeast
flavor
there
is
also
a
slight
dark
fruit
presence
and
a
slight
balance
of
earthy
hops
at
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
overall
a
very
nice
very
good
beer
nothing
harsh
to
make
you
dislike
it
just
a
smooth
taste
and
an
inviting
aroma
to
make
you
want
more
a
good
representation
of
the
style
solid
beer
but
didnt
blow
me
away
years
back
the
only
dubbles
available
were
from
belgium
and
while
many
were
great
beers
freshness
was
always
an
issue
as
i
have
stated
before
the
usa
is
making
world
class
beers
in
every
style
we
are
currently
living
in
a
golden
age
of
beer
enjoy
it
while
it
lasts
overall
what
can
i
say
maybe
i
have
become
a
quadrupel
snob
with
the
likes
of
westvleteren
12
and
rochefort
but
i
like
a
sense
of
sweetness
and
fruit
in
my
beer
this
just
feels
like
a
semigood
imitation
beer
really
cannot
tell
the
big
difference
between
a
quadrupel
and
dubbel
o
a
very
rich
and
fulfilling
experience
im
sad
that
this
single
has
to
be
finished
moreys
bottom
line
im
no
expert
on
dubbels
ive
only
had
a
handful
within
the
style
but
this
one
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
its
easy
to
see
why
this
beer
receives
the
ratings
that
it
does
overall
a
staple
when
i
feel
like
something
belgian
style
bonus
points
for
being
available
in
four
packs
for
very
reasonable
the
aftertaste
on
this
beer
is
incredible
i
have
never
sampled
a
drink
beer
or
other
that
has
done
so
much
along
the
way
the
smells
are
intense
filled
with
those
spices
everyone
talks
about
then
the
initial
flavors
it
just
gets
better
and
better
this
beer
is
incredible
if
you
like
beer
any
kind
of
beer
grab
a
bottle
of
this
bottoms
up
people
this
beer
is
good
overall
an
excellent
dubbel
easily
comparable
to
the
best
from
belgium
o
overall
a
very
good
dubbel
and
better
than
many
belgian
attempts
at
the
style
it
balances
the
sweetness
nicely
with
the
bready
characteristics
and
is
highly
attenuated
so
that
it
doesnt
become
sticky
sweet
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
starter
for
the
style
if
youre
looking
into
dubbel
its
drinkable
and
after
a
few
sips
gives
a
nice
warm
in
the
stomach
feeling
too
o
pretty
good
beer
may
have
had
this
one
a
bit
too
long
dont
remember
when
i
bought
it
eitherway
i
enjoy
ommegangs
beers
and
would
never
turn
one
down
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
could
lend
itself
to
more
of
a
hop
character
the
flavors
open
up
more
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
definitely
a
sipper
for
me
and
more
of
a
dessert
beer
than
anything
else
poured
a
cloudy
copperbrown
with
a
small
beige
head
that
dissipates
quickly
dark
sugars
in
the
aroma
with
dried
fruits
and
sweet
malts
similar
taste
with
brown
sugar
molasses
raisins
peach
and
a
hint
of
clove
and
allspice
alcohol
comes
through
just
a
bit
complex
and
flavorful
wellbalanced
mediumbodied
and
a
pleasant
drink
the
only
real
downside
is
that
theres
no
huge
plus
its
good
in
all
regards
and
a
great
all
around
drink
but
i
cant
say
that
it
left
me
needing
to
get
more
i
know
they
did
a
great
job
on
another
belgian
brew
but
it
isnt
up
my
tree
perhaps
too
much
sweetness
for
me
overall
again
not
awful
but
not
what
i
would
call
a
good
example
of
a
dubbel
bears
some
similarity
to
millennium
ale
from
dominion
brewing
co
out
of
virginia
which
is
intended
as
a
barley
wine
if
that
helps
for
comparison
both
would
be
best
enjoyed
in
smaller
quantities
beer
is
light
in
body
heavily
carbonated
in
the
mouth
beer
is
pretty
dry
heavy
in
yeast
character
there
is
a
mild
metallic
flavor
to
this
beer
it
is
good
gets
better
as
it
warms
id
have
it
again
if
there
were
few
options
pours
dark
amber
with
a
huge
khaki
head
aroma
is
sweet
juicy
dark
fruit
a
touch
of
some
roastiness
that
gives
off
some
chocolate
spice
and
a
little
orange
flavor
follows
suit
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
overall
this
one
was
my
intro
into
american
made
belgian
styled
beers
and
it
was
a
great
one
great
beer
i
was
struck
first
by
the
head
which
was
plentiful
and
sticky
the
color
is
a
light
brown
with
tints
of
orange
i
did
not
get
an
overwhelming
taste
of
caramel
but
i
did
find
a
faint
taste
of
fruit
it
was
somewhat
sweet
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
the
thing
i
was
struck
by
most
was
the
carbonation
which
was
noticeable
and
lasting
overall
despite
the
alcohol
content
i
didnt
feel
as
overwhelmed
as
i
sometimes
am
with
say
dogfish
head
90
minute
ipa
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
a
great
introduction
to
ommegang
brewery
o
im
not
really
a
fan
of
this
style
but
im
enjoying
drinking
this
well
enough
i
wont
want
a
second
although
its
much
better
when
i
stop
thinking
and
start
drinking
ommegangs
selftitled
is
a
rich
complex
abbey
dubbel
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
outranks
many
of
its
belgian
counterparts
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
tried
a
12
oz
bottle
rather
than
picking
up
a
larger
750ml
bottle
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
a
larger
bottle
to
try
really
soon
a
fantastic
brew
that
has
enough
complexity
to
please
the
snobs
but
enough
friendliness
to
open
someones
world
to
belgian
style
beer
and
being
domestic
its
got
a
nice
price
tag
too
o
although
this
is
my
first
dubbel
ill
defintely
be
trying
more
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
true
style
delicious
o
i
like
it
about
the
only
dubbel
i
would
buy
another
four
pack
of
best
in
spring
or
summer
p
pairs
fantastic
with
chili
rubbed
pork
redeye
bbq
sauce
pulled
pork
and
steak
o
this
beer
is
a
good
rep
of
the
style
but
i
dont
see
why
it
always
gets
such
high
scores
a
clean
tasting
beer
that
i
would
have
a
couple
pints
of
but
it
is
a
once
in
a
blue
moon
kind
of
beer
for
me
abv
is
just
about
right
for
me
to
really
enjoy
this
but
yep
an
ok
beer
for
me
o
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
its
fantastic
mellow
yet
full
of
interest
worth
seeking
out
deep
crimson
and
amber
flashes
makes
this
brew
quite
refreshing
in
appearance
a
biege
head
with
great
retention
tops
it
off
smell
is
fruity
spicy
sweetoh
my
taste
is
fruity
but
has
a
noticeable
boozy
tinge
that
reminded
me
of
nail
polish
remover
though
i
find
that
is
common
with
higher
abv
alesthis
example
being
8
5
also
some
spices
peaking
through
in
the
finishi
e
cloves
most
of
the
flavor
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
palate
with
a
heavy
feel
and
medium
carbonation
a
quality
brew
but
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
florence
nj
one
of
the
best
belgians
ive
ever
had
very
complex
depth
and
variety
of
sweetness
satisfying
to
the
tastebuds
the
whole
way
down
i
like
it
with
anything
one
of
the
best
belgians
ive
ever
had
very
complex
depth
and
variety
of
sweetness
satisfying
to
the
tastebuds
the
whole
way
down
i
like
it
with
a
pepperyfruity
cheese
like
robusto
or
piave
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
slightly
muddy
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
the
head
sticks
around
but
does
really
give
us
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
yeasty
and
had
some
dark
fruits
in
the
mix
the
taste
of
the
beer
seemed
pretty
close
to
a
real
belgian
dubbel
this
was
one
of
my
first
ommegangs
i
had
ever
tried
and
was
surprised
that
they
were
based
out
of
ny
the
flavors
are
earthy
and
rich
some
yeasty
fruits
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
not
overly
carbonated
o
this
is
just
fantastic
all
around
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
relatively
cheap
one
compared
to
the
rest
of
their
offerings
recommend
ps
the
8
5
abv
is
noticeable
in
the
smell
a
bit
yet
is
well
masked
in
the
taste
d
very
nice
offering
worth
a
try
for
any
ambelgian
lover
and
also
worth
a
side
by
side
to
show
the
differences
between
this
and
an
import
m
certainly
a
drier
ale
but
that
is
to
be
expected
for
the
higher
abv
8
5
not
overly
chewy
and
the
carbonation
is
perfect
mfo
creamy
feel
to
it
despite
the
big
carbonation
prickle
easy
drinker
a
bit
sweet
overall
a
refreshing
beer

you
are
in
the
mood

some
big
time

monster
white

sits

lite
chocolates
grapes

strong
pungent
belgian
yeast
presence
as
would
be

with

taste
similar
to
a
dark

very
sweet
and
dry
extremely
complex
rich
fruits
tart
sugars
a
hop
bitterness
on
the
end
thick

presence
to

very
dry
and
sugary
on

tongue
a
nice
sweetness
that
opens
up
all
the
taste

this
is
a
fantastic
world
class
beer
cheers
o
this
has
one
of
the
best
heads
ive
ever
seen
on
a
beer
i
normally
dont
really
appreciate
sweet
fruit
flavors
in
my
beer
but
this
is
fairly
minimal
and
balanced
pours
a
nice
looking
crimson
tinged
brown
big
lucious
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
smells
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
earthy
must
palate
is
full
of
fruity
esters
giving
notes
of
plums
and
bananas
sweet
and
toasty
malts
and
a
kiss
of
earthy
hops
round
out
the
brew
medium
bodied
with
a
mildly
dry
mouthfeel
very
flavorful
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
o
overall
a
solid
brew
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
would
have
expected
from
the
rave
reviews
of
this
beer
i
would
have
hoped
for
more
estery
fruitiness
to
offset
and
mingle
with
the
spice
but
a
quality
representation
of
the
style
nonetheless
would
have
again
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
the
equal
of
some
belgian
dubbels
mf
moderate
to
full
creamy
body
the
flavors
linger
for
quite
a
while
on
your
palate
o
lives
up
to
its
reputation
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
to
date
very
drinkable
for
an
8
50
cheers
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
dubbel
style
and
truly
the
best
ive
ever
had
from
an
american
brewery
i
find
myself
consistently
impressed
by
ommegang
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
and
there
is
nothing
objectionable
here
the
only
reason
im
giving
it
a
4
overall
instead
of
a
4
5
is
that
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
but
only
imported
from
belgium
highly
recommend
this
beer
although
it
is
almost
as
expensive
as
the
belgian
brethren
very
tasty
dubbel
one
of
the
best
north
american
versions
ive
had
rich
and
robust
good
value
too
as
i
can
get
a
4pack
for
the
price
of
an
imported
750ml
and
this
is
just
as
good
had
this
a
number
of
time
in
the
past
just
never
reviewed
and
is
a
top
candidate
anytime
im
craving
a
belgianstyle
beer
at
first
sight
it
comes
off
as
being
a
sipper
as
it
is
a
dubbel
but
this
beer
is
so
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
dance
on
the
tongue
not
too
sticky
medium
body
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
i
think
that
i
will
have
many
more
of
these
had
to
love
this
as
a
dubbel
it
rates
right
up
there
super
treacley
goodness
and
a
great
carbonation
level
had
it
at
dba
in
williamsburg
chilled
to
perfection
love
the
rich
brown
color
too
if
anything
at
all
i
would
have
said
a
bit
light
on
mouthfeel
but
this
is
probably
just
me
as
i
like
a
bit
more
slickness
than
wateryness
and
this
is
probably
smack
on
for
the
style
four
finger
medium
foam
head
of
light
brown
lace
is
dense
but
very
little
cling
color
is
a
29
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
a
wonderful
complex
venue
of
fragrances
there
are
scents
of
plum
honey
pepper
ginger
peach
cinnamon
toffee
roasted
wheat
and
malt
flavor
is
just
as
complex
as
the
smell
with
tastes
of
honey
roasted
coffee
toffee
plum
raisins
dark
chocolate
green
apple
black
pepper
cinnamon
and
a
light
taste
of
lime
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
smooth
and
has
a
snappy
crispness
great
beer
overall
will
buy
this
again
and
recommend
it
to
my
deep
beer
friends
overall
i
dig
this
beer
not
on
the
regular
rotation
for
me
but
next
winter
ill
start
a
fire
and
enjoy
i
am
a
big
fan
of
ommegang
and
this
style
beers
but
this
wasnt
my
favorite
dubbel
the
reveal
ommegang
abbey
ale
great
stuff
although
i
prefer
their
quad
three
philosophers
a
bit
more
i
am
a
huge
belgian
ale
fan
so
i
think
that
biases
my
review
here
but
this
this
is
a
great
beer
it
has
a
very
dark
chestnut
look
with
a
fruity
smell
and
taste
the
taste
is
dark
and
sweet
slightly
slightly
bitter
with
a
good
finish
that
is
just
a
tad
alcoholic
i
think
this
beer
if
you
like
the
dark
belgians
is
a
real
winner
and
i
would
very
much
buy
this
again
all
in
all
a
textbook
dubbel
that
is
easy
to
obtain
i
commend
ommegang
for
doing
what
they
do
a
wellcrafted
dubbel
reddishbrown
body
topped
by
a
thick
tan
head
that
has
staying
power
nose
full
of
malt
and
yeasty
dark
fruit
character
flavor
is
true
to
the
aroma
with
a
bit
sharpness
from
the
alcohol
teaming
with
the
lowlevel
hop
bitterness
to
keep
the
malt
in
check
finishes
just
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
overall
a
very
flattering
take
on
a
classic
dubbel
d
highly
highly
drinkable
drinkability
i
would
drink
this
on
occasion
its
not
a
bad
thirstquencher
especially
for
being
a
mediumbodied
beer
duppels
arent
my
favorite
but
it
definitely
was
worth
the
experience
if
you
like
belgianstyle
ales
with
relatively
high
abv
and
rich
fruity
flavors
i
recommend
this
beer
dmaybe
a
little
sweet
for
sustained
drinkability
poured
a
hazy
brown
with
a
large
tan
rocky
head
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
toasted
malts
dried
fruit
a
leathery
yeast
and
had
a
moderate
alcohol
scent
it
tasted
slightly
sweet
yet
acidic
in
the
beginning
and
finished
about
the
same
with
a
mild
alcohol
flavor
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
with
the
texture
being
quite
creamy
overall
an
assume
brew
and
quite
satisfying
to
drink
d
to
the
extent
of
the
abv
some
extra
belching
that
might
be
a
detractor
for
session
bloating
in
fact
im
still
bloating
up
half
an
hour
later
a
lot
more
so
than
with
a
typical
belgianbelgian
dubbel
maybe
a
bit
too
carbonated
the
cpj
d
better
than
average
but
not
my
favorite
d
i
had
2
glasses
out
of
the
750ml
bottle
and
i
just
couldnt
finish
it
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
i
will
review
this
one
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
my
tastes
change
mouthfeel
was
great
it
was
so
well
carbonated
i
could
feel
each
bubble
burst
on
my
tongue
and
each
sip
left
me
wanting
more
and
more
and
more
great
job
ommegang
i
dont
know
what
went
wrong
with
me
and
this
beer
for
me
just
didnt
pique
my
taste
buds
as
a
great
dubbel
drinkability
very
delicious
relies
more
on
malt
than
yeast
character
but
its
hard
to
argue
with
results
this
tastes
good
d
quite
nice
easy
to
drink
lingering
flavors
are
pleasant
nice
to
have
this
on
our
side
of
the
pond
a
top
contender
in
this
style
a
must
try
from
ommegang
i
will
be
aging
a
couple
bottles
aswell
overall
a
good
dubbel
but
certainly
not
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
worth
a
try
though
and
well
worth
the
money
very
nice
beer
beautiful
dark
amber
color
came
in
a
four
pack
and
loved
every
sip
nice
mouthfeel
with
slight
cling
but
fresh
and
trailing
sweetness
taste
was
sweet
but
had
a
balanced
rough
almost
coffee
like
note
very
printable
even
though
you
can
really
feel
the
moderately
high
abv
highly
recommended
this
is
tasting
pretty
smooth
no
doubt
helped
by
cellaring
the
alcohol
is
quickly
warming
more
than
id
expect
from
a
8
5
abv
in
sum
id
say
it
is
a
bit
more
dry
roasty
than
many
dubbles
not
too
sweet
not
as
highly
spiced
and
pretty
drinkable
bottle
poured
into
a
dfh
tulip
glass
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
very
lively
and
think
light
tan
head
that
is
slow
to
settles
as
it
the
head
settles
it
leaves
a
nice
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
on
the
rather
light
side
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
very
slight
booze
dark
fruit
caramel
and
a
subtle
spice
all
play
in
the
flavor
lightmedium
mouthfeel
with
a
pretty
lively
level
of
carbonation
overall
i
lke
this
enough
to
drink
again
but
it
isnt
anything
id
go
running
out
to
grab
all
that
often
ends
with
a
lingering
slight
spiciness
and
mild
bitterness
overall
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
this
dubbel
a
bit
complex
but
well
executed
but
the
sweetness
is
can
be
cloying
after
a
while
beautiful
deep
brown
wonderful
sweet
smell
thats
hard
to
pin
down
its
just
awesome
tasted
slightly
sweet
with
full
flavor
mix
of
perfectly
combined
malt
and
yeast
again
very
hard
to
describe
accurately
without
going
too
far
down
any
one
road
plum
notes
show
up
in
the
flavor
but
dont
linger
too
long
very
nice
going
down
in
fullflavored
swallows
if
you
can
find
it
grab
it
it
had
been
a
long
time
and
this
one
actually
performed
similarly
to
how
i
had
remembered
it
as
a
very
good
beer
that
has
a
bit
of
a
distracting
bitterness
d
keep
these
coming
opinion
well
i
am
going
to
have
to
say
that
this
is
not
the
smoothest
dubbel
i
have
ever
tried
especially
upfront
the
dark
malts
are
just
too
assertive
for
the
first
few
sips
to
make
it
really
stand
out
as
a
beer
to
seek
out
as
it
is
it
is
pretty
decent
as
i
am
half
way
through
the
bottle
and
i
can
think
of
just
about
any
other
dubbel
i
would
rather
have
than
this
one
i
guess
this
would
be
an
alright
one
to
follow
up
an
imperial
stout
or
something
that
was
more
roasty
but
as
a
first
beer
it
was
a
bit
of
a
shocker
to
the
system
for
too
long
in
the
session
for
my
taste
d
i
would
get
this
again
i
slight
sipper
if
you
want
it
to
be
but
it
can
be
consumed
rather
quickly
this
is
one
of
the
best
dubbles
i
have
ever
had
d
i
would
def
go
back
to
this
beer
again
and
again
d
i
could
easily
drink
this
everyday
cant
get
tired
of
this
one
made
me
feel
really
sad
when
it
was
all
gone
i
would
most
definitely
go
back
for
another
and
would
suggest
this
one
to
quite
a
few
beer
fans
very
drinkable
and
just
a
really
great
beer
i
dont
know
much
about
dubbels
or
belgian
styles
in
general
but
i
know
that
this
is
a
wonderfully
enjoyable
beer
this
was
a
very
good
beer
there
is
lots
of
complex
flavor
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
heavy
chalice
glass
pours
a
mostly
clear
deep
reddish
mahogany
body
with
a
twofinger
width
fizzy
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
some
nice
lacing
that
stuck
around
very
nice
vinous
aroma
berry
honey
raisin
a
light
toffee
bread
malt
and
some
softly
spiced
yeast
the
flavor
is
more
malt
based
than
the
aroma
but
still
maintains
a
bit
of
a
vinous
quality
starts
with
some
toasted
caramels
and
a
bit
of
bubbly
berry
taste
lots
of
raisins
and
some
more
toasty
caramels
come
in
during
the
middle
while
still
maintaining
a
soft
bubbly
carbonation
some
candy
licorice
slightly
tart
dark
fruits
yeast
and
banana
bread
come
in
during
the
finish
where
it
dries
at
a
nice
pace
sweet
aftertaste
that
lingers
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
raisin
toasty
caramel
vinous
fruits
and
a
light
spicing
palate
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
nice
soft
carbonation
throughout
overall
a
pretty
solid
dubbel
just
a
tad
too
sweet
but
enjoyable
and
even
more
satisfying
at
the
backend
of
the
750ml
bottle
deep
reddishbrown
in
color
fruity
aroma
with
a
distinct
malty
undertone
initial
taste
was
sweet
with
lively
carbonation
a
medium
body
that
was
finished
with
a
nicely
rounded
bitterness
nice
complexity
i
enjoyed
the
noticeable
roasty
components
of
this
wellmade
dubbel
brownish
with
amber
red
color
in
chalice
style
glass
thick
off
white
head
smells
of
apple
toast

is
much
of
the
same
with
fruity
sweetness
apple
cider
fig
and
bread
toast
flavor
also
a
little
boozy
sourness
comes
through
on
the
backend
very
good
dubbel
overall
impression
a
solid
beer
on
all
fronts
ommegang
abbey
ale
possesses
a
rich
complex
character
i
would
consider
it
a
heavy
beer
in
light
of
its
richness
and
8
5
abv
making
it
a
wonderful
brew
to
sip
and
savor
the
beer
is
sweetier
and
earthier
it
tastes
dirtier
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
body
isnt
quite
there
like
it
is
with
a
fresher
bottle
some
of
the
fruit
flavors
have
mellowed
out
and
it
is
a
little
off
i
was
expecting
something
different
with
a
characteristic
belgian
like
this
we
did
however
pair
the
beer
with
a
lovely
havarti
i
cant
believe
how
much
i
am
starting
to
sound
like
martha
stewart
she
is
totally
invading
my
thoughts
might
want
to
have
that
checked
out
its
brewed
with
orange
peel
and
various
spices
you
can
easily
taste
the
orange
but
its
not
overpowering
and
is
perfectly
balanced
with
a
hops
taste
d
very
tasty
the
only
problem
i
have
is
the
telltale
hint
of
metal
d
this
concoction
is
very
drinkable
i
think
the
higher
carbonation
level
balances
out
a
lot
of
the
alcohol
presence
a
great
beer
poured
a
brownish
color
with
a
nice
1
finger
head
this
beer
has
a
flavorful
malt
smell
the
first
sip
was
very
smooth
and
stayed
that
way
through
the
whole
beer
tasted
of
sweet
malts
and
sugar
at
8
5
this
tasted
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
one
would
have
to
be
very
careful
if
they
are
hanging
out
for
the
day
like
i
was
a
great
beer
to
have
a
tap
and
something
i
would
have
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
not
different
enough
however
to
have
on
hand
all
the
time
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
has
a
big
foamy
head
high
level
of
bubbly
carbonation
a
very
pretty
beer
smells
fruity
malty
has
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
aroma
i
did
notice
a
cherry
taste
too
big
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
yeast
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
just
right
at
8
5
abv
its
more
of
a
sipping
beer
for
me
but
still
delicious
and
id
definitely
want
another
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
or
especially
a
dessert
the
taste
goes
well
with
fruit
or
chocolate
this
was
the
first
dubbel
ive
tried
and
im
impressed
dm
smooth
drinking
great
complexity
little
carbonation
tingle
overall
wonderful
notes
first
belgian
stlye
ive
tried
beside
blue
moon
saw
on
a
mix
and
match
rack
at
wegmans
and
decided
to
try
definatley
a
great
beer
drinkable
dubbels
are
great
beers
but
at
8
5
one
is
plenty
if
you
expect
to
be
able
to
taste
it
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
though
d
a
very
nice
dubbel
strong
on
the
cherries
as
it
warms
up
i
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
loved
the
taste
would
like
to
have
again
d
like
many
in
the
belgian
style
this
beer
is
way
too
drinkable
id
recommend
it
to
any
beer
lover
d
a
bit
heavy
and
high
in
alcohol
but
definitely
on
the
affordable
side
for
a
beer
of
this
caliber
i
finished
nearly
the
entire
bottle
by
myself
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
like
this
after
my
first
swig
i
took
a
shower
and
let
it
warm
up
then
everything
came
together
i
havent
had
many
dubbels
but
this
one
made
a
positive
impression
on
me
ill
keep
my
eyes
open
for
others
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
a
bomber
of
this
tomorrow
if
this
weather
holds
and
they
say
it
will
di
would
not
want
more
than
one
of
these
d
easy
to
finish
and
quite
the
bargain
at
7
99bottle
this
is
probably
my
go
to
beer
for
this
style
ommegang
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
on
north
american
soil
at
making
authentic
tasting
belgian
beers
this
is
a
classic
american
dubbel
fairly
reminiscent
of
chimay
red
to
me
from
what
i
recall
at
the
price
this
goes
for
it
is
hard
not
to
be
satisfied
even
if
some
of
the
belgians
trump
it
this
is
not
a
difficult
750
ml
to
tackle
solo
i
almost
bumped
the
flavor
higher
but
thats
probably
the
territory
for
the
belgians
to
occupy
still
very
nice
effort
d
a
good
sipping
brew
imho
the
best
beer
at
this
brewfest
a
very
enjoyable
beer
enjoyable
every
sip
d
extremely
rich
and
inviting
complex
interesting
and
delicious
had
in
a
22oz
bottle
admittedly
dubbles
are
normal
not
in
my
palate
so
i
cannot
rank
this
one
high
i
found
this
to
have
too
much
winey
taste
and
a
bit
two
thick
for
drinking
more
than
one
if
you
do
like
a
deep
rich
beer
you
may
like
this
one
give
it
a
shot
in
a
bottle
flavor
is
very
sweet
for
a
dubbel
style
taking
away
from
the
drinkability
but
bringing
a
more
robust
character
deep
fruits
and
sweet
malts
are
on
the
forefront
with
a
nutty
drying
finish
carbonation
is
moderate
and
body
is
full
and
sweet
overall
a
great
belgian
style
taste
for
56
ommegang
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
was
a
big
let
down
it
was
fruity
but
the
alcohol
bled
through
to
much
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
deffinatley
not
reccomend
it
the
three
philosiphers
is
way
better
d
low
due
to
the
sweetness
dont
see
myself
wanting
to
pick
this
one
back
up
at
all
my
hometown
isnt
terribly
far
from
cooperstown
maybe
an
hour
so
i
definitely
feel
a
connection
to
this
brew
well
done
d
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
sits
well
i
edited
this
after
having
a
pannepot
reserva
2008
as
well
as
other
dubbles
since
the
original
review
i
tried
my
best
to
focus
on
style
going
from
an
awesome
quad
to
a
dubbel
but
the
experience
did
open
my
eyes
a
bit
i
do
think
i
reviewed
this
a
bit
too
high
originally
i
was
nervous
about
this
one
because
a
lot
of
people
told
me
it
was
awful
but
i
love
ommegang
and
had
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
i
really
want
to
slap
myself
for
even
being
nervous
all
of
ommegangs
stuff
is
really
great
and
this
one
is
no
exception
d
a
good
beer
just
with
too
strong
an
initial
alcoholic
hit
to
be
moved
into
great
served
from
corked
bottle
into
goblet
at
fridge
temperature
carbonation
is
suitably
high
this
pours
with
an
excellent
head
that
remains
thick
the
lacing
is
excellent
the
flavor
is
of
roasty
malt
without
being
very
sweet
or
very
malty
the
hops
are
absolutely
perfectly
matched
the
bitterness
is
just
right
and
the
hops
never
take
center
stage
no
flavor
seems
to
take
center
stage
actually
in
the
orchestrally
harmonious
beer
this
is
well
done
this
will
definitely
be
a
staple
in
my
collection
beer
poured

rather
than
syrupy
overall
a
unique
brew
it
is
hard
to
pin
down

familiar

wonderful

i
would
like
to
see
this
beer
be
a
little
less
hot
given
that
it
is
bottle
conditioned
i
would
suggest
leaving
a
bottle
or
two
for
just
two
months
of
aging
a
great

palate
is
that
with
a
hit
of

sweetness
and
pollen
as
well
that
is
dissipated
on
the
palate
by
the
carbonation
at
first
then
the
sweet

comes
out
a

poured

tan

this
beer
is
murky
brown
in
color
the
aroma
is
browncaramelized
sugar
with
some
plumfig
the
taste
is
some
dark
fruit
up
front
and
finishes
with
some
roasted
caramel
malt
which
lingers
on
my
tongue
it
has
plenty
of
carbonation
i
really
enjoy
the
toasted
malt
in
the
aftertaste
it
keeps
me
wanting
to
take
another
sip
this
one
has
a
perfect
fruity
rich
taste
and
is
just
stunning
in
the
glass
perfect
light
brown
head
my
compliments
to
the
brewers
i
have
no
interest
in
ever
going
to
cooperstown
for
the
baseballl
hall
of
fame
we
have
the
football
one
nearby
and
it
is
just
ok
music
ones
are
good
though
check
out
our
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
in
a
beautiful
june
day
but
i
just
may
go
up
to
upstate
ny
to
make
an
ommegang
pilgrimage
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
belgian
dubbel
style
but
a
little
high
in
the
alcohol
content
i
think
this
beer
would
be
better
if
it
were
in
the
7
abv
range
instead
of
8

12oz

a
great
dubbel
while
its
not
as
good
as
some
others
chimay
comes
readily
to
mind
its
certainly
a
serious
contender
and
would
give
an
true
belgian
dubbel
a
run
for
its
money
definitely
worth
a
shot
and
definitely
something
ill
have
again
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
less
than
im
accustomed
to
paying
for
belgian
style
beers
6
99
for
the
bottle
at
trader
joes
often
i
go
for
tripels
or
quads
but
this
is
a
nice
change
a
bit
lighter
and
less
fruity
a
very
good
beer
notes
a
great
beer
too
drinkable
at

abv
notes
an
instant
classic
traditional
and
bold
at
the
same
time
pairs
really
well
with
food
as
well
i
try
to
keep
a
few
of
these
guys
around
at
all
times
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
dark
brown
almost
reddish
with
a
nice

predominantly
fruity
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
every

a
slight

keeps
the

buds
guessing
and
wanting
more
excellent
finish
silky
smooth
drinkability
is
excellent
the
abv
is
8
5
but
well
hidden
under
layers
of
flavor
a
beautiful
dubbel
highly
recommended
alcohol
is
a
bit
towards
the
foreground
but
is
well
balanced
against
the
rich
fruit
flavors
at
8
5
this
is
probably
a
solo
flight
verdict
decent
enough
and
wellpriced
drink
it
if
you
see
it
but
not
worth
seeking
out
the
body
has
a
good
thickness
without
seeming
too
heavy
the
carbonation
is
perfectly
crisp
yet
nonobtrusive
the
dry
dry
finish
yields
superbly
easy
drinking
great
beer
great
american
brewed
belgian
style
beer
overall
nothing
special
kind
of
disappointed
considering
to
the
average
ba
score
maybe
a
750
ml
is
a
better
format
d
a
complex
beer
flavor
wise
and
even
mouthfeelwise
but
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
the
beer
stays
fairly
drinkable
for
its
8
50
apv
d
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
session
one
in
a
evening
would
be
plenty
very
dark
amber
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
remains
thick
throughout
lacing
is
particularly
strong
very
strongly
carbonated
the
smell
is
very
weak
smells
like
pennies
with
a
malty
undertone
taste
is
also
metallic
with
some
dark
fruit
and
dark
but
not
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
and
creamy
from
the
thick
head
its
drinkable
but
unremarkable
for
a
dubbel
i
guess
its
ok
but
i
was
expecting
more
seems
like
a
safe
beer
d
this
fits
the
dubbel
style
quite
nicely
i
dont
think
its
perhaps
the
best
example
ive
had
but
it
is
pretty
tasty
and
quaffable
well
made
and
drinkable
although
a
bit
of
the
higher
alcohol
comes
through
in
nose
and
flavor
profile
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
caramelamber
color
there
was
a
good
bit
of
a
fluffy
tan
head
on
it
that
doesnt
completely
go
away
it
has
a
very
nice
nose
dark
fruits
and
carameltoffee
are
up
front
some
yeastiness
and
breadiness
in
there
too
the
taste
is
quite
good
there
is
almost
no
sweetness
in
fact
it
finishes
a
bit
dry
toffee
notes
some
of
the
dark
fruits
and
some
chocolate
a
nice
beverage
another
second
chance
at
another
ommegang
favorite
it
pours
a
hazy
auburn
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
slightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
figs
raisins
red
grapes
cloves
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
prunes
the
taste
follows
very
closely
with
the
addition
of
sourdough
pepper
banana
and
a
scraping
of
tangerine
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fizzily
thick
feel
overall
a
very
nice
dubbel
one
that
ill
be
sure
to
keep
revisiting
in
the
future
its
a
bit
on
the
fizzy
side
but
it
doesnt
overdo
this
flaw
and
makes
up
fer
it
with
a
great
taste
and
a
hefty
body
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
true
to
the
style
about
time
an
american
brwery
got
the
belgian
style
right
this
classic
belgian
pours
a
rich
dark
mahogony
and
has
a
creamy
tan
2
finger
head
its
aroma
is
filled
with
dark
fruits
figs
and
raisins
the
taste
is
terrific
with
dark
fruits
and
caramel
malt
very
impressive
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel

it
a
try
there
are
so
many
different
dishes
that
would
be
great
with
ommegang
abbey
duck
stew
with
mashed
potatoes
is
a
perfect
match
game
meats
roast
suckling
pig
lamb
chops
venison
sausage
and
almost
any
dessert
especially
those
with
chocolate
would
all
be
excellent
pairings
too
as
for
cheese
try
it
with
something
nutty
such
as
brie

hoch

or
piave

d
the
dry
well
blended
rich
toffee
flavor
has
some
yeasty
cidery
notes
that
are
just
a
bit
drab
perhaps
with
some
age
more
flavors
will
develop

some
reddish
hues
off

and
some
good
lacing

brings
forward
raisins
molasses
caramel
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
doesnt
quite
meld
everything
together
with
some
sugars
and
dark
fruits
coming
through
in
the
end
moderate
creamy
mouthfeel
with
lowish
carbonation
drinks
pretty
well
but
not
my
favorite
from
them
ddefinitely
not
for
sessioning
however
this
is
an
excellent
way
to
wrap
up
an
evening
d
um
not
exactly
a
session
beer
its
actually
pretty
drinkable
for
what
it
is
though
since
it
doesnt
have
one
flavor
that
overpowers
overall
very
solid
beer
overall
great
representation
of
the
style
definitely
worth
giving
a
shot
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
bit
of
ruby
red
showing
through
in
the
light
its
got
a
very
thin
head
that
leaves
tan
lacing
till
the
end
abbey
ales
aroma
has
hints
of
raisins
vanilla
and
dark
roasted
malt
in
it
the
flavor
has
notes
of
toast
grapes
sour
cherries
and
maybe
some
molasses
its
got
a
medium
full
mouthfeel
ommegang
abbey
ale
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
is
also
filling
this
beer
was
a
great
match
for
chunks
of
smoked
swiss
cheese
highly
recommended
d
high
nothing
wrong
with
this
delicious
d
since
i
dont
enjoy
the
finish
of
this
beer
i
dont
find
it
to
be
very
drinkable
it
is
definitely
drinkable
but
only
for
one
or
two
after
that
i
could
not
taste
it
or
anything
else
lots
of
fruity
malty
notes
in
this
dark
brown
delicious
dubbel
its
definitely
one
of
the
best
bargains
and
most
accessible
belgians
around
here
it
doesnt
pack
as
much
of
a
punch
as
their
quad
but
it
exemplifies
the
style
very
well
and
its
amazing
trader
joes
has
this
for
a
measley
8
or
so
drinkabilty
the
22
0z
would
be
perfect
for
one
person
any
more
then
that
and
you
would
spoil
yourself
and
miss
out
on
the
flavors
cause
you
would
expect
it
fantasic
cant
wait
to
get
more
m
not
nearly
as
dry
as
expected
but
im
not
complaining
at
all
has
some
good
body
to
it
before
the
mediumdry
finish
d
this
has
a
little
more
than
year
on
it
in
my
cellar
and
its
much
smoother
than
when
i
cracked
a
fresh
one
from
the
store
its
very
nice
for
the
style
deh
the
tastes
sorta
bland
together
alcohol
note
becomes
stronger
d
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
highly
rated
a
typical
dubbel
that
is
made
in
america
ive
had
more
flavorful
dubbels
no
doubt
but
for
an
american
dubbel
this
is
on
target
dry
and
a
little
more
rugged
and
this
would
be
the
real
deal
cheers
pours

of
the

with
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
cherry
raisin

nuts
with
the
sweet

the
flavour
is
really
nicely
balanced

the

through

is
quite
high
a
very
nice
dubbel
overall
impression
malty
and
sweet
this
is
unique
for
the
style
its
not
my
favorite
but
very
drinkable

quite
nicely
drinkable
for
this
abv

perhaps
a

too
sweet

end

this
ommegnag
never
disappoints
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
traditional
enough
to
fit
the
style
well
but
different
enough
to
be
unique
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
certainly
is
a
beer
that
one
can
feel
8
5
out
of
notes
overall
a
decent
beer
pretty
big
flavors
with
a
good
amount
of
spice
burnt
and
rum
flavors
that
make
it
a
bit
strong
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
not
a
bad
beer
overall
need
to
have
this
one
with
a
steak
cant
have
many
with
high
abv
a
pretty
solid
brew
from
ommegang
though
i
prefer
the
three
philosophers
i
like
the
flavors
better
in
that
one
as
i
prefer
the
cherries
to
the
prunes
and
figs
well
put
together
just
the
same
though
verdict
great
brew
notes
the
2nd
of
my
ommegang
8
pack
sample
i
liked
it
better
than
the
pale
ale
so
far
the
appearance
of
the
brews
has
been
2nd
to
none
served
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
wine
glass
sorry
but
i
was
at
the
inlaws
and
no
chalice
was
available
nice
head
that
remained
a
while
i
purchased
this
beer
after
doing
a
fair
amount
of
research
i
read
of
very
favorable
comparisons
to
trappist
offerings
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
good
product
it
is
complex
but
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
the
closest
trappist
i
can
associate
it
with
is
koeningshoeven
or
westmalle
this
restores
my
faith
in
american
brewing
you
will
be
pleased
enjoy
the
abbey
ale
on
its
own
or
with
so
many
varieties
of
food
try
soft
and
melty
cheeses
tomato
based
pastas
meat
pastas
like
lasagna
grilled
red
meat
roast
turkey
or
chicken
mexican
or
indian
foods
anything
with
chocolate
in
it
strawberry
cheesecake
and
on
and
on
drinkability
is
easy
on
this
one
can
barely
notice
the
8
5abv
d
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
it
grew
on
me
this
is
the
first
dubbel
i
have
had
as
i
normally
stick
with
trippels
but
this
could
change
that
only
thing
that
hurts
the
drinkability
is
the
high
abv
without
it
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
a
long
time
drinkability
if
it
werent
8
5
abv
i
would
drink
this
beer
all
night
expertly
blended
none
of
the
flavors
go
too
far
nor
are
the
fruity
sugars
remotely
cloying
everything
rounds
off
beautifully
in
each
sip
its
to
be
savored
if
you
have
the
patience
little
bit
of
warmth
in
the
finish
makes
this
a
smart
choice
as
an
afterdinnerdessert
drink

didnt
blow
me
away
but
a
good
dubbel
for
sure
poured
from
a
bottle
into
my
snifter
darker
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
tan
head
that
sticks
around
and
laces
well
smell
is
definitely
fruity
and
grapy
and
is
noticeable
as
soon
as
the
bottle
was
opened
taste
is
very
much
more
grapy
with
the
other
fruits
taking
more
of
a
back
seat
feel
is
nice
and
carbonated
well
with
some
crispness
overall
a
great
beverage
that
i
will
be
having
again
d
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
be
more
than
happy
maybe
even
too
happy
given
the
percent
alcohol
in
this
beer
i
recommend
it
also
this
was
my
first
beer
to
write
a
review
for
the
first
of
many
i
hope
drinkability
this
is
the
best
dubbel
i
have
with
a
strong
complex
aroma
and
taste
however
i
have
never
found
this
to
be
the
easiest
to
drink
style
even
quads
are
more
drinkable
for
me
d
high
alcohol
is
present
but
not
obviously
so
this
scrumptious
belgianesque
brew
comes
highly
recommended
although
for
what
its
worth
i
prefer
the
750ml
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
solid
brown
with
a
tan
microbubbled
head
that
washes
the
glass
like
a
wave
on
every
drink
smell
is
coffee
and
almond
rather
sweet
but
with
some
astringency
tastes
richer
and
more
toasted
than
the
smell
with
loads
of
flavor
and
complexity
while
the
feel
morphs
into
carbonated
spiciness
aftertaste
is
bitter
spiky
and
active
almost
no
alcohol
burn
to
note
remarkable
for
an
8
5
brew
definitely
a
filling
beer
as
well
the
750ml
bottle
is
plenty
for
me
at
one
sitting
imo
a
beer
that
looks
better
than
it
tastes
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
complex
enough
to
keep
you
guessing
and
mindful
of
each
sip
d
i
cant
drink
a
lot
of
these
to
expensive
and
filling
but
this
is
a
great
treat
one
of
the
finest
dubbels
produced
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
ill
definitely
be
back
for
more
of
this
well
done
ommegang
d
i
am
already
looking
for
a
place
that
carries
this
near
me
absolutely
awesome
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
incredibly
well
balanced
with
a
nice
malty
sweetness
that
is
not
overdone
ommegang
im
trying
to
give
myself
a
little
more
of
an
education
on
the
belgian
styles
this
was
a
nice
dip
of
the
toe
perfect
for
a
humid
summer
evening
nice
cool
and
crisp
with
a
fruity
taste
a
touch
of
sour
nicely
designed
on
the
pallet
id
recommend
it
certainly
a
nice
change
in
variety
poured
with
a
thick
head
a
nice
copper
color
this
beer
has
plenty
to
deliver
and
leaves
a
nice
rosiness
on
the
cheeks
ommegang
makes
solid
brews
and
this
is
no
exception
mouthfeel
is
light
well
carbonated
creamy
and
is
overall
very
drinkable
and
very
good
d
one
bottle
of
this
size
is
perfect
i
would
imagine
this
would
work
well
with
a
big
dinner
with
the
first
glass
during
and
the
second
after
as
a
dessert
will
definitely
try
it
again
and
would
recommend
it
drinkability
an
ideal
session
beer
to
an
enthusiast
with
no
prior
obligations
for
the
evening
drinkability
good
example
of
a
classic
style
flavorful
and
lively
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
again

it

more
carbonation

i
remember
the
last

i
had
this
in

too
much
imo
nonetheless

not
sure
i
could
sit
through
many
of
these
in

was

have
the

rather
be

ideal
for

a
good

lighter
and
sweeter
than
what
i

it
may

fans

also
catch

i
would
have
this

again
a
nicely
constructed
beer
which
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
boys
from
cooperstown
a
wonderful
rendition
of
the
style
with
all
the
earmarks
of
some
of
the
best
versions
it
loses
a
little
of
its
luster
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
enough
to
ruin
the
experience
of
a
wellcrafted
beer
all
told
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
price
point
of
6

makes
it
a
good
choice
when
im
feeling
in
a
belgiany
mood
id
like
to
check
out
their
trippel
overall
a
very
strong
choice
this
would
be
outstanding
with
a
nice
steak
served
hot
off
the

im
looking

to
my
next

rounds
this

high
marks
for
me
another
stellar
belgian
recreation
take
from

all
in
all
it
was
a
very
good
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
drink
more

i
could
have
a
few
of
these
d
very
smooth
and
deliciously
sippable

lovers

a

with

an
excellent
abbey
dubbel
authentictasting
for
americanmade
ommegang
strikes
again
a
very
subtle
flavored
dubbel
which
may
be
the
result
of
high
carbonation
washing
some
of
the
flavors
away
as
it
settled
it
certainly
got
better
lighter
body
but
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
some
warming
alcohol
but
not
overwhelming
very
enjoyable
i
decided
to
leave
the
taste
at
4
5
although
i
wish
the
rating
system
went
in
quarter
point
increments
lol
on
my
second
goround
i
could
taste
the
alcohol
more
but
that
didnt
lower
my
rating
it
just
kept
me
from
the
full
upgrade
to
5
i
appreciate
the
ratings
system
on
this
site
because
i
can
see
just
how
elusive
the
allperfect
55555
beer
will
really
be
as
others
have
said
surprisingly
drinkable
and
though
this
is
marketed
and
categorized
as
a
dubbel
id
say
it
would
make
a
nice
compromise
between
a
dubbel
and
trippel
looking
forward
to
trying
the
rest
of
their
beers
m
d
creamy
and
full
bodied
with
nice
frothy
and
crisp
body
high
drinkability
even
with
the
8
5
d
highly
enjoyable
and
very
tasty
beer
rich
enough
that
i
would
not
likely
want
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
though
abv
is
restrained
and
price
is
reasonable
as
this
is
a
domestic
take
on
the
style
and
a
great
one
at
that
d
well
one
and
done
i
didnt
like
the

much

from
the
glass
nice
dark
color
but
the
flavor
isnt
overwhelming
as
many
stouts
and
porters
the
smell
makes
you
think
it
will
be
overly
sweet
but
i
think
it
offers
subtle
raisin
and
plum
background
with
a
clovelike
nip
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
what
separates
this
beer
from
many
other
abbey
styles
very
silky
but
not
overly
coating
the
carbonation
cleanses
as
it
passes
over
the
tongue
all
in
all
a
delicious
hearty
beer
from
our
friends
at
ommegang
nice
work
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
crimsonredish
hue
and
a
lot
of
foam
to
top
it
off
about
3
fingers
worth
it
is
an
aesthetically
pleasing
beer
in
my
opinion
but
thats
just
a
personal
preference
and
you
can
only
do
so
much
nitpicking
in
this
category
on
the
nose
i
get
sort
of
a
musty
old
liquorice
mixed
with
some
dark
fruits
like
plums
or
raisins
possibly
cherries
too
its
pretty
complex
for
a
belgianstyle
dubbel
so
it
was
rather
difficult
to
pinpoint
all
the
nuances
in
this
one
in
fact
a
rereview
may
be
in
the
works
for
this
reason
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
but
not
entirely
overpowering
either
theres
a
decent
balance
of
taste
and
spicyness
on
the
palate
theres
some
maltyness
here
no
doubt
along
with
hints
of
nutmeg
caramel
and
maybe
even
tobacco
i
would
say
its
a
heavier
beer
i
believe
this
beer
would
make
a
great
pairing
for
a
nice
cut
of
meat
like
a
steak
or
some
pork
chops
perhaps
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
bitter
at
first
impression
but
this
beer
definitely
grows
on
you
and
that
bitterness
quickly
dissipates
into
a
sweeter
fullbodied
beer
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
would
like
to
have
this
beer
occasionally
probably
with
an
entr√©e
or
even
a
dessert
but
not
so
much
of
an
everyday
type
of
beer
however
it
suffices
to
say
this
beer
could
be
had
at
anytime
or
anyplace
with
enjoyment
but
better
suited
to
the
occasion
of
fine
dining
d
delicious
and
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
drinking
them
all
night
after
2
id
move
on
to
something
lighter
glad
i
only
had
the
one
but
glad
i
had
the
one
to
compare
it
with
others
drinkability
a
hearty
brew
well
constructed
complex
a
good
example
of
the
style
ommegang
does
belgian
beers
well
is
all
i
can
say
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
ommegang
it
is
on
par
with
some
of
the
better
dubbels
available
pepper
and
nutty
malts
peach
and
raisin
flavors
dominate
midpalate
the
finish
is
buttery
with
a
slick
yeasty
aftertaste
it
was
pleasant
enough
but
not
something
id
revisit
too
often
and
of
the
few
times
ive
had
this
ive
had
carbonationoxidization
problems
with
about
12
the
bottles
so
buyer
beware
this
one
creeped
up
on
me
unexpectedly
so
be
careful
will
definitely
have
again
probably
more
for
cooler
weather
another
fine
beer
from
ommegang
a
vigorous
pour
into
my
duvel
tulip
yields
a
gorgeous
murky
maroon
beer
with
a
voluminous
tan
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
few
minutes
before
leaving
some
nice
if
uneven
lace
down
the
side
of
the
glass
doesnt
smell
as
complex
as
i
had
hoped
though
the
nose
is
still
good
a
clove
spiciness
from
the
yeast
really
dominates
thankfully
the
ommegang
abbey
ales
taste
has
more
layers
to
it
the
previously
noted
yeasty
contributions
are
there
along
with
some
alcohol
soaked
dark
fruits
raisins
come
to
mind
first
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
lurking
in
the
background
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
has
a
suitably
full
body
though
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
rich
8
5
could
have
fooled
me
no
booziness
to
this
beer
whatsoever
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
that
abbey
ale
is
a
great
beer
ommegang
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
o
balance
is
the
noteable
characteristic
of
this
beer
definitely
recommend
md
the
flavors
go
together
relatively
well
carbonated
on
the
tongue
and
pretty
smooth
going
down
overall
a
good
beer
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beerwould
share
with
friends
and
drink
again
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
dubbel
but
i
think
the
brewers
went
too
far
with
the
abv
this
is
by
all
means
a
solid
dubbel
in
my
modest
opinion
i
think
this
beer
will
be
much
better
having
been
aged
awhile
good
thing
for
me
i
have
three
more
bottles
in
my
cellar
d
very
palletable
and
inoffensive
an
easy
drinker
with
fruity
complexities
d
very
drinkable
despite
the
8
5
abv
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
overall
abbey
ale
is
an
admirable
stab
at
the
style
but
doesnt
compete
with
the
best
that
belgium
has
to
offer
this
is
a
harsh
assessment
as
its
still
a
very
nice
beer
but
i
must
compare
an
american
take
on
a
belgian
beer
to
its
belgian
counterparts
still
this
a
tasty
beer
and
is
definitely
worth
trying
it
was
my
first
belgianstyle
ale
and
really
opened
my
eyes
to
the
world
of
belgians
so
for
that
it
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
drink
it
if
you
havent
in
conclusion
this
was
an
excellent
beer
it
remained
highly
complex
and
each
sip
yielded
a
new
flavor
i
must
say
for
the
price
you
cant
beat
this
beer
this
is
currently
my
celebratory
beer
of
choice
impressions
complex
its
hard
to
distinguish
exactly
whats
going
on
in
this
beer
i
feel
like
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
could
drink
dozens
of
times
and
notice
something
different
each
time
that
does
not
detract
from
the
fact
that
its
enjoyable
to
sip
and
at
only
6
for
a
750ml
bottle
this
is
definitely
a
nice
one
for
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
belgian
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
just
allright
i
am
decidedly
underwhelmed
with
this
one
as
i
had
much
higher
expectations
for
a
dubbel
of
this
price
and
roots
in
cooperstown
notes
ommegang
abbey
ale
is
a
wellmade
u
s
version
of
a
classic
belgian
style
however
as
far
as
dubbels
go
i
have
not
found
a
beer
that
equals
chimay
red
while
this
beer
is
certainly
tasty
in
its
own
right
it
is
not
as
complex
as
chimay
has
more
alcohol
bite
and
has
less
yeast
a
dealbreaker
for
me
for
these
reasons
i
would
not
be
likely
to
choose
ommegang
abbey
ale
over
chimay
ommegang
abbey
ale
is
a
decent
belgian
style
beer
it
pours
fairly
dark
with
light
colored
head
that
lingers
i
dont
find
the
smell
to
be
overly
appealing
but
it
isnt
bad
the
taste
is
a
little
sweeter
than
you
might
expect
but
lives
a
slight
bitter
after
taste
nice
carbonation
in
this
beer
not
the
best
belgian
stlye
beer
ive
had
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
ommegang
as
many
have
said
the
abv
is
not
noticeable
and
is
very
drinkable
d
surprisingly
drinkable
the
flavors
are
not
too
pronounced
like
they
can
be
in
some
dubbels
one
of
the
most
complex
flavor
combinations
ive
encountered
in
beer
high
abv
but
you
could
probably
drink
3
of
these
im
very
impressed
its
the
most
excited
ive
been
about
a
beer
in
a
while
drinkability
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
dubble
style
enjoyed
ths
very
much
fantastic
if
more
selfproclaimed
trappist
traditionalist
brews
were
like
this
i
wouldve
been
a
fan
long
ago
d
either
my
palate
has
changedmatured
or
this
is
getting
close
to
being
just
too
old
i
remember
this
to
be
awesome
when
i
had
it
very
early
on
when
i
first
started
getting
into
craft
beer
its
good
but
not
what
i
remember
its
much
more
earthier
than
fruit
driven
i
remember
more
fruits
in
this
i
will
seek
this
out
again
hopefully
find
a
fresher
one
ommegang
needs
to
start
dating
when
these
were
bottled
d
drinks
nicely
for
8
5
alcohol
nicely
concealed
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
that
i
would
never
turn
down
the
only
drawback
is
the
lack
of
nose
but
the
rest
of
it
makes
up
for
that
for
sure
this
is
a
very
imperfect
not
particularly
welldone
beer
overall
it
tastes
good
but
it
has
some
glaring
flaws
and
an
occasionally
unpleasant
flavor
for
6
its
not
bad
but
even
on
a
budget
id
usually
go
for
unibroue
or
the
lower
end
allagash
beers
over
this
or
just
drop
a
couple
dollars
more
for
a
far
superior
import
dominant
in
the
taste
with
a
nice
rich
earthy
flavor
following
up
feel
on
this
one
is
pleasant
lively
carbonation
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
score
this
one
above
average
on
the
drinkablity
scale
though
not
my
ideal
take
on
the
style
but
i
know
a
good
dubbel
when
i
get
one
farrmhousey
and
very
traditional
i
would
have
believed
it
came
from
belgium
rather
than
new
york
at
less
than
6
a
bomber
i
could
see
where
this
is
popular
with
the
follks
a
great
beer
definitely
one
to
age
if
you
have
the
space
as
it
is
good
to
drink
now
and
will
only
improve
with
time
overall
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
i
can
see
how
this
has
improved
over
the
fresh
version
as
its
mellowed
nicely
and
has
a
good
fruitiness
to
it
good
stuff
d
great
for
the
8
5
abv
d
a
very
rich
brew
far
better
suited
for
savoring
though
i
easily
made
it
through
my
two
glasses
i
may
have
even
been
game
for
another
has
a
pronounced
rasinprune
scent
to
the
beer
the
taste
is
dark
malts
fruit
and
an
alcohol
burn
surprisingly
easy
to
take
down
goes
down
smoothly
with
no
adverse
after
taste
drinkability
great
dubbel
alchol
is
evident
as
it
warms
but
its
contained
well
great
balance
and
drinks
like
a
nice
full
bodied
cabernet
would
pair
with
pot
roast
steak
and
anything
that
needs
a
big
bold
beer
to
stand
up
to
it
shortcomings
considered
this
is
a
great
belgian
dubbel
ommegang
makes
really
good
belgian
style
beers
at
typically
affordable
craft
beer
prices
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
theirs
tastes
like
a
mess
in
a
way
thats
not
horrible
but
im
having
trouble
picking
out
new
flavors
an
orange
taste
is
followed
by
something
thats
like
over
ripe
banana
and
barnyard
funk
and
also
a
spice
and
tart
layer
underneath
all
this
cherries
seem
to
be
pretty
strong
at
the
first
hit
or
flavor
but
subside
as
the
profile
lingers
there
is
also
a
bit
of
sherry
red
wine
but
its
real
slight
that
being
said
the
booze
is
untraceable
in
this
which
i
really
like
the
mouth
feel
is
full
enough
i
know
what
im
drinking
is
far
from
watery
i
want
to
say
i
also
taste
tea
and
something
very
like
lemon
as
well
this
is
a
beer
that
comes
into
focus
as
i
continue
with
it
the
malt
contains
caramel
and
chocolate
without
being
overt
with
either
of
those
flavors
overall
an
awesome
flavor
experience
notes
it
had
been
a
while
since
i
had
it
and
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
repeat
back
in
my
early
days
in
the
country
this
was
among
those
that
made
me
want
to
explore
and
appreciate
us
craft
beer
the
belgium
connect
at
that
time
was
of
great
support
not
so
much
anymore
but
that
is
me
while
i
may
not
seek
it
on
a
regular
basis
it
remains
pretty
solid
and
recommendable
nice
to
have
it
around
drinkability
great
beer
for
the
price
great
introduction
into
dubbel
style
it
is
amazing
how
well
it
hides
the
8
5abv
d
pretty
smooth
drinker
not
my
favorite
style
to
drink
but
i
am
enjoying
this
one
d
for
a
beer
this
strong
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
mighty
tastey
i
normally
dont
score
higher
abv
high
in
this
area
but
this
one
was
just
so
good
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
dubbel
robust
and
packed
with
flavor
yet
still
highly
drinkable
another
great
offering
from
ommegang
pours
a
clearish
auburn
brown
with
onefinger
head
that
gives
a
slight
bubbly
head
that
sticks
around
a
great
smell
that
is
typical
of
great
belgians
as
it
has
an
orange
fruit
smell
hints
of
yeasty
breadiness
and
some
caramel
sugary
sweetness
taste
follows
as
this
thicker
chewier
beer
is
full
of
sweet
sugary
malts
a
lingering
yeast
note
that
keeps
it
balance
and
even
lends
itself
to
a
slightly
dry
backbite
has
some
fruity
citric
notes
in
there
along
with
some
spicy
clove
to
furthur
enhance
the
beer
the
fruit

even
have
a
little
juicy
grapeapple
note
and
a
tad
tart
edge
classic

not
too
sweet
ommegang
brewery
recommended
a
hearty
meat
dish
with
this
beer
preferably
french
so
i
found
a
pork
chops
with

and
cream
recipe
thanks
to
foodnetwork
com
very
tasty
i
modified
a
little
email
me
for
my
substitutions
happy
to
respond
d
overall
very
good
for
the
price
its
hard
to
beat
d
drinkability
is
on
par
with
others
of
its
kind
but
dubbels
just
dont
seem
to
have
that
overly
drinkable
quality
and
the
alcohol
warmth
takes
away
from
this

with
an
ample

i
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
is

the
sweetness
would
keep
me
from
having
several
edit
this
a
beer
thats
simply
itching
to
be
accompanied
by
good
cheese
so
ive
broken
out
some
red
leicester
i
just
happened
to
have
standing
by
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
to
an
ommegang
chalice
this
is
a
dark
hazy
amber
almost
brown
produced
a
beautiful
off
white
two
finger
foamy
head
that
hung
around
the
duration
of
the
beer
brings
nice
hints
of
sweet
fruits
tastes
sweet
with
hints
of
fruit
and
a
slight
citrusy
finish
very
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
a
tremendous

of
a
belgian

alcohol
is
well
masked
in
the
bountiful

drinkability
very
drinkable
a
good
example
of
the
belgian
dubbel
style
another
winner
from
the
fine
brewmasters
at
ommegang
d
first
had
this
almost
seven
years
ago
before
i
had
a
full
appreciation
for
belgianstyle
beers
remember
it
knocked
my
socks
off
feeling
is
still
there
today
an
american
trappiststyle
dubbel
that
rivals
most
european
versions
d
not
my
favourite
dubbel
but
an
interesting
offering
and
turned
out
better
than
i
originally
thought
after
first
taste
value
i
finished
the
entire
bottle
by
myself
but
the
8
5
abv
will
definitely
come
back
to
kick
you
so
i
wouldnt
recommend
any
more
than
this
at
one
sitting
but
its
a
great
sipping
beer
many
reviewers
found
even
more
flavors
in
it
than
i
did
so
drink
it
slowly
and
see
how
many
different
tastes
and
smells
you
can
pick
out
this
beer
is
a
true
classic
my
personal
benchmark
for
the
style
and
thats
saying
something
for
sure
pours
a
deep
brown
with
orangered
highlights
and
a
medium
sized
tan
head
that
leaves
a
generous
amount
of
fine
lacing
on
the
rim
of
a
the
chalice
a
wonderful
bouquet
of
ripe
dark
fruit
dark
rich
malts
caramelized
sugar
a
lightly
spicy
yeast
note
and
a
slight
wave
of
alcohol
full
and
very
round
in
the
mouth
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
larger
quaff
rich
enough
without
being
to
filling
very
well
balanced
this
beer
has
endless
food
pairing
possibilities
d
its
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
me
with
complexity
which
for
a
dubbel
may
or
may
not
be
a
bad
thing
overall
this
beer
doesnt
disappoint
one
of
the
ubiquitous
offerings
from
ommegang
and
theres
a
reason
why
worth
a
shot
the
bottle
is
a
stately
75cl
corked
and
basketed
with
a
red
label
with
heraldic
lions
holding
aloft
an
o
this
is
sullied
by
the
instructions
for
pouring
on
the
side
upon
pouring
i
realize
how
translucent
the
glass
actually
is
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
indication
of
when
it
was
bottled
the
beer
pours
easily
with
a
rusty
colour
and
a
minimal
light
tan
head
it
smells
yeasty
with
hints
of
banana
and
pepper
the
odour
is
sweet
and
creamy
drinking
it
it
has
a
silt
like
consistency
on
the
tongue
the
creamy
texture
really
stands
out
here
as
well
as
the
mild
fruits
theres
mild
carbonated
bite
to
it
but
the
liquid
clings
to
the
mouth
coating
it
due
to
its
mouthfeel
it
suffers
from
lower
drinkability
you
must
pace
yourself
or
intersperse
glasses
with
either
water
or
cheese
because
it
becomes
overwhelming
otherwise
d
drink
is
as
good
as
it
can
be
smooth
this
is
one
of
my
top
styles
and
for
the
price
it
can
not
be
beat
overall
great
sipping
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
over
a
nice
fire
place
and
chatting
with
friends
i
think
this
one
shouldnt
be
paired
with
anything
just
enjoy
the
naked
unadulterated
flavors
overall
a
very
drinkable
belgian
put
out
by
americas
own
little
slice
of
belgium
ommegang
brewery
this
is
my
third
i
think
beer
from
them
and
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
d
its
a
big
bottle
with
a
strong
abv
so
if
you
can
get
past
that
youll
be
good
to
go
overall
very
good
a
cozydownrelax
beer
when
youre
winding
down
still
want
to
enjoy
some
complexity
the
beer
equivalent
of
a
good
book
buy
again
no
served
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
bottle
poured
with
a
nice
dark
amber
color
the
red
is
very
prominent
the
smell
was
most
prominent
with
scents
of
fruits
but
i
felt
the
smell
was
almost
non
existent
for
me
it
was
above
average
at
best
along
with
the
taste
the
beer
did
feel
good
in
my
mouth
gave
a
nice
bite
even
though
the
beer
had
that
going
for
it
the
taste
was
really
lacking
for
me
this
is
probably
my
favorite
ale
for
over
a
year
now
nothing
has
bumped
this
out
of
1st
place
for
me
i
love
everything
ive
had
from
ommegang
and
this
is
my
favorite
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
loves
an
amazing
abbey
ale
poured
a
dark
cloudy
brown
body
with
an
airy
khaki
head
nose
is
spicey
and
dry
taste
is
caramel
and
toffee
ride
over
a
light
burn
of
alcohol
its
a
bit
earthy
and
spicey
but
i
did
not
notice
much
belgian
yeast
characteristics
in
this
brew
recommended
overall
an
excellent
nighttime
beer
i
dont
know
if
id
be
prone
to
drink
this
with
meals
but
later
into
the
night
it
is
perfect
all
aroun
great
dubbel
particularly
as
a
warm
up
to
another
stronger
belgian
d
high
drinkablity
this
is
an
ideal
beer
for
a
wine
lover
but
also
has
plenty
to
offer
to
the
recovering
hophead
very
diff
then
most
beers
ive
tried
will
def
be
serving
this
at
a
future
dinner
party
chances
are
youve
had
this
already
if
you
havent
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
a
bottle
or
better
yet
a
4
pack
right
away
overall
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
not
a
good
one
a
very
average
belgain
dubbel
d
i
dont
think
belgian
dubbels
are
for
me
it
was
good
to
try
but
i
dont
think
i
could
have
another
one
my
palate
may
not
be
ready
for
dubbels
quite
yet
theres
more
complexity
in
the
beer
than
my
tongue
could
discern
i
have
also
had
it
from
a
bottle
which
wasnt
nearly
the
samw
experience
yet
still
a
great
drink
it
is
slightly
sharper
and
more
bitter
in
taste
than
the
standard
abbey
ale
but
significantly
more
complex
d
delicious
brew
but
i
dont
think
i
would
enjoy
more
than
a
few
ommegang
is
definitely
in
my
top
3
brewers
list
their
beers
carry
a
distinct
signature
flavor
to
them
and
you
can
really
feel
the
quality
in
all
of
them
from
their
look
and
smell
to
the
flavor
and
aftertaste
each
one
is
worth
a
try
for
any
fan
of
quality
made
beer
d
this
one
is
a
tough
call
because
while
i
enjoy
it
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
dubbels
and
darker
ale
but
do
like
them
i
think
there
are
other
brews
just
like
this
one
that
are
superior
in
quality
flavor
and
drinkability
trios
pistoles
would
be
one
example
d
a
delicious
dubbel
d
sweet
and
boozy
enjoyable
but
one
was
enough
this
was
pretty
much
the
brew
that
got
me
into
craft
im
not
sure
what
happened
maybe
my
tastes
just
changed
but
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
at
all
and
will
probably
scratch
it
off
my
list
of
favorites
it
just
fell
way
short
of
the
true
belgian
dubbels
wasnt
even
close
very
drinkable
great
abbey
ale
i
drank
24rds
of
this
big
bottle

found
it

with
a
generous
topping
of
foamy
tan
head
about
two
inches
deep
not
as
hazy
as
traditional

still
inviting
the

is
an
appetizing
balance
of
wheat
caramel
malts
and
yeast
with
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
in

distance
a

licorice
with

very
authentic
ommegang
gets
it
right

its

a
good

a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
your
typical
american
dubbel
just
ok
for
me
though
nothing
special
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
overall
a
decent
dubbel
worth
trying
this
is
a
fullbodied
beer
on
the
stronger
side
of
the
carbonation
scale
im
not
one
for
lots
of
fizz
so
thats
pretty
much
my
only
dislike
about
this
beer
this
brew
has
a
very
crisp
feel
to
it
as
it
goes
down
and
is
easily
sessionable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
two
year
old
bottle
classic
mahogany
pour
with
a
finger
of
bubbly
tan
head
decent
retention
and
lace
sweet
fruity
malt
aroma
lots
of
good
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
bsda
in
feel
some
yeasty
spice
in
the
tail
smooth
flavour
again
lots
of
dark
fruit
im
thinking
dates
figs
and
raisin
a
good
dose
of
caramel
and
a
nice
sweet
spicing
that
lingers
in
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
luxurious
carbonation
im
thinking
a
bit
of
age
on
this
works
well
as
the
abv
is
completely
absent
ill
crack
the
relatively
fresh
one
soon
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
to
a
standard
pint
glass
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
vey
light
tan
head
that
starts
out
thick
and
goes
slowly
into
a
thick
film
great
lacing
fruity
spicy
aroma
sweet
and
sour
in
taste
and
alcohol
is
very
noticable
a
very
complex
and
well
made
brew
drinkability
i
think
i
was
spoiled
by
the
cave
aged
version
or
perhaps
this
one
should
have
spent
more
time
in
my
cellar
i
purchased
and
drank
it
on
the
same
day
but
it
seems
to
lack
a
depth
of
complexity
still
quite
a
nice
dubbel
d
as
far
as
dubbels
go
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
another
winner
from
ommegang
these
guys
do
belgian
brews
just
as
well
as
the
belgians
do
drinkability
this
is
gorgeous
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
definitely
the
best
dubbel
abv
is
well
hidden
in
this
balanced
brew
toasted
sugar
and
caramel
roll
malt
up
front
yeasty
estery
bananas
and
rummy
fruit
sweetness
follow
some
plum
more
caramel
and
cocoa
near
the
finish
more
delicious
yeasty
spiciness
in
the
finish
with
lingering
estery
fruits
fullbodied
with
lively
bottleconditioned
carbonation
and
a
creamy
feel
a
delicious
classic
that
rivals
belgiums
best
im
very
impressed
with
this
id
place
it
in
my
top
5
easily
maybe
top
3
i
cant
believe
ive
never
reviewed
this
one
as
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
had
that
made
me
realize
beer
could
have
tons
of
flavor
it
used
to
be
one
that
i
had
about
one
every
week
or
so
and
started
my
love
affair
with
truly
great
beers
so
i
picked
one
up
to
have
with
thanksgiving
dinner
and
like
always
it
didnt
let
me
down
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
has
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smells
great
lots
of
sweet
dark
fruit
aromas
with
a
nice
bready
yeast
in
the
background
also
picking
up
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
well
taste
closely
follows
the
nose
nice
fruity
flavors
like
plum
and
fig
has
a
slightly
sweet
burnt
sugary
notes
as
well
and
is
slightly
alcoholic
very
carbonated
with
a
nice
clean
dry
finish
very
nice
beer
from
a
great
brewery
pours
a
cloudy
ruddy
amber
with
a
lighter
copper
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
one
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
dark
citrus
cherriesplums
sweet
malt
and
slight
tart
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
dubbel
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
citrus
tart
malt
sweet
malt
and
slight
yeast
overall
a
great
body
blend
and
appearance
update
this
is
a
world
class
brew
on
tap
draft
version
is
beautiful
sweet
but
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
not
as
cloying
as
it
is
from
a
bottle
last
had
at
ommefest
just
as
i
remember
it
being
such
a
great
all
around
beer
great
color
and
aroma
plenty
of
spices
and
slightly
sweeter
aromas
with
nice
dry
finsh
so
good
the
most
solid
brew
that
ommegang
makes
year
in
and
year
out
the
dark
brown
color
and
full
flavored
palate
makes
me
wonder
why
so
many
other
breweries
are
making
crappier
beer
for
more
money
truley
a
gem
i
think
we
all
overlook
future
outlook
very
good
drink
and
readily
available
i
can
easily
envision
crossing
paths
again
d
very
drinkable
imho
i
could
drink
2
of
these
and
be
all
set
at
8
5
certainly
a
very
respectable
beer
and
brewery
ommegang
is
doing
a
right
good
job
up
there
flavor
is
interesting
for
awhile
but
the
mouthfeel
really
detracts
from
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
think
i
may
tend
to
confuse
fusel
alcohol
flavors
with
belgian
yeast
flavors
miscategorizing
fusel
beers
as
belgian
tasting
while
i
dont
typically
prefer
beers
of
this
style
im
digging
this
one
maybe
i
need
to
try
some
other
good
belgian
style
beers
plus
who
the
fuck
quotes
montaigne
on
a
beer
bottle
d
a
very
smooth
drink
for
the
alcohol
content
but
still
not
the
type
of
beer
i
could
have
several
of
another
great
brew
from
the
crew
at
cooperstown
glad
that
these
beers
have
finally
made
their
way
to
oklahoma
i
would
stay
and
write
more
but
my
glass
is
empty
and
the
rest
of
the
bottle
is
calling
my
name
cheers
drinkability
is
pretty
good
on
this
even
at
8
5
cant
go
wrong
with
this
belgian
d
definitely
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
session
beer
its
a
decent
dubbel
especially
for
the
price
750
ml
for
5
50
i
just
wish
the
booze
wasnt
so
apparent
in
the
smell
and
taste
im
going
to
throw
the
other
half
of
this
bottle
into
the
fridge
for
an
hour
and
see
how
that
changes
the
experience
ill
edit
my
review
if
i
find
any
sgnificant
changes
dthis
is
a
beer
i
could
sit
buy
the
fire
and
sip
all
day
or
night
or
both
but
i
would
want
to
make
sure
i
had
nothing
to
do
cause
after
a
coupple
of
these
i
would
not
wanna
stand
up
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
somewhat
hazy
iced
teaish
brown
color
with
the
traditional
huge
belgian
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
thick
collar
very
active
carbonation
quite
a
few
bubbles
rising
through
the
brown
haze
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
my
nose
picks
up
hints
of
peach
apple
and
apricot
first
sip
is
almost
orgasmically
delicious
raisins
plums
peach
apricot
caramel
honey
all
soaked
in
a
rum
like
alcohol
backdrop
but
the
alcohol
acts
a
a
compliment
to
the
chorus
present
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
rich
creamy
tingly
with
some
alcohol
bitterness
on
the
swallow
but
again
nothing
overpowering
my
oh
my
simply
fantastic
now
the
baseball
hall
of
fame
drops
to
second
place
on
the
list
of
reasons
to
visit
cooperstown
medium
body
not
much
fizz
per
se
more
like
large
bubbles
that
bloom
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
almost
scarily
so
for
an
8
5
beer
drinkability
very
good
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughlywill
drink
it
again
overall
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
ommegang
abbey
ale
again
but
compared
to
the
rochefort
6s
i
have
hiding
in
the
closet
it
might
be
a
while
before
i
pick
up
another
750
of
this
beer
dubbels
are
as
drinkable
as
belgians
get
for
me
great
taste
and
nice
carbonation
without
the
heaviness
of
a
quad
makes
a
great
drinking
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
biting
carbonation
just
wonderful
d
tasty
delicious
in
fact
i
would
drink
another
and
buy
another
4pack
too
funky
and
too
much
late
booziness
to
be
perfectly
drinkable
definitely
a
tasty
brew
and
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
this
bottle
and
probably
another
but
not
quite
at
the
rare
vos
level
d
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
i
could
really
get
into
this
one
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
trappist
glass
poured
a
deep
brownmahogany
color
with
beautiful
head
and
lacing
aroma
reminiscent
of
sugary
fruit
and
toffee
the
sweet
aroma
does
not
disappoint
as
the
taste
brings
forward
a
nice
caramel
note
with
a
great
malt
sweetness
finishes
crisp
with
a
slightly
bitter
note
but
overall
an
excellent
mouthfeel
and
predinner
compliment
to
cheese
or
as
i
had
it
a
beautiful
compliment
to
chocolate
cake
the
mouthfeel
is
a
decent
medium
a
little
too
much
carbonation
results
in
a
thinner
feel
than
i
would
like
poured
with
a
fantastic
foamy
frothy
textured
offwhite
to
light
tan
head
and
infinite
lace
color
is
a
lovely
clear
coppery
amber
aroma
is
yeasty
and
malty
flavor
is
dates
figs
raisins
and
dark
bread
body
is
great
as
is
carbonation
finish
ditto
session
beer
mmm
dunno
drinkability
easy
to
drink
a
few
but
the
sweetness
makes
it
hard
to
have
too
many
d
very
nice
beer
very
dinkable
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
still
i
really
like
the
smell
of
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
a
few
of
these
an
excellent
us
version
of
a
belgian
style
d
its
a
tough
one
here
i
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
higher
drinkability
rating
but
given
its
sweetness
and
being
as
heavy
as
it
is
i
just
couldnt
make
it
through
more
than
one
im
actually
pretty
happy
i
didnt
go
for
the
magnum
bottle
finishes
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
a
nice
american
brewed
belgianstyle
ale
d
ive
yet
to
of
tried
a
bad
brew
from
my
boysand
girls
down
in
cooperstown
this
one
is
no
exception
easily
the
best
american
version
of
the
style
and
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
drinkability
sadly
this
was
my
last
last
one
ive
been
saving
it
for
quite
some
time
now
and
as
you
all
know
the
greater
the
wait
the
greater
the
reward
over
the
years
that
have
passed
since
i
first
tried
this
ommegang
its
certainly
gotten
more
pronounced
in
the
bitter
areas
the
same
as
with
humani
generis
i
guess
final
line
is
this
beer
holds
everything
you
could
expect
from
a
genuine
trappist
so
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
this
yankee
doodle
brewski
go
for
it
d
this
beer
is
complex
take
your
time
with
it
and
really
enjoy
the
flavors
simply
delicious
d
very
very
drinkable
a
perfect
fall
or
winter
nightcap
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
taste
is
delicious
burnt
raisins
brown
sugar
and
bakers
chocolate
dinner
roll
bread
notes
mix
with
fruity
and
spicy
yeast
esters
and
creates
an
almost
nutmeglike
flavor
that
is
quite
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
like
but
that
is
a
minor
complaint
this
is
a
damn
fine
ale
and
a
year
in
the
cellar
seems
to
have
improved
this
beer
by
a
good
margin
dtoo
sour
for
my
taste
an
amazing
dubbel
hard
to
believe
this
came
from
new
york
and
not
a
16th
century
abbey
d
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
am
going
to
have
a
lot
of
but
finishing
a
glass
is
no
problem
perfect
for
after
dinner
or
even
pre
diner
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
will
be
purchasing
again
poured
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
deep
malt
scent
hints
of
fig
and
alcohol
deep
flavor
very
strong
and
malty
hints
of
fig
that
were
nearly
overwhelmed
by
the
alcohol
flavor
very
warming
on
a
cool
day
but
i
wish
the
alcohol
flavor
wasnt
quite
so
noticable
after
all
an
8
5
dubbel
can
have
it
masked
still
think
this
could
go
a
bit
longer
would
like
to
see
it
mellow
down
a
little
more
the
pour
from
the
750
ml
bottle
produced
a
generous
head
over
a
deep
amber
brew
i
could
not
comment
on
the
smell
as
it
was
allergy
season
and
my
sense
of
smell
was
compromised
the
taste
however
was
exquisite
the
strong
malty
estery
tangy
flavor
included
apricot
and
toast
there
was
moderately
strong
carbonation
and
very
little
hops
presence
definitely
on
the
buyagain
list
an
excellent
dubbel
d
it
has
a
very
cloy
8
5
abv
i
plan
on
finishing
the
whole
750ml
a
very
good
double
not
too
sweet
or
heavy
just
right
dry
yet
fruity
a
complex
multigeared
beer
md
perfectly
carbonated
with
a
mediumfull
body
goes
down
so
smooth
as
it
warms
up
i
cant
taste
much
alcohol
even
at
8
5
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
could
do
a
whole
bottle
definitely
a
special
occasion
or
desert
beer
d
for
a
nice
big
dubbel
this
is
extremely
drinkable
balanced
if
not
slightly
muted
but
this
almost
makes
you
just
want
t
drink
more
to
enjoy
the
great
flavours
that
are
there
drinkability
its
very
good
however
the
fruit
attack
was
a
little
much
for
me
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
this
one
again
ommegang
has
done
an
excellent
job
with
this
beer
cant
wait
to
try
three
philosophers
and
hennepin
conclusion
will
have
to
let
the
rest
of
the
case
rest
until
the
first
snow
try
it
again
in
front
of
a
fire
and
see
if
it
gets
any
better
highly
recommend
good
complexity
a
nice
homage
to
the
trappists
that
stands
on
its
own
while
its
certainly
a
solid
offering
i
find
myself
not
sure
if
i
like
the
whole
be
like
a
red
wine
thing
its
done
with
class
but
i
think
its
distracting
i
broke
this
beer
out
at
a
barbecue
the
other
day
to
show
one
of
my
neighbors
what
real
beer
is
needless
to
say
he
put
down
his
miller
lite
and
wanted
to
drink
my
entire
bottle
brewery
ommegang
was
started
in
1997
in
a
traditional
belgium
style
farmhouse
located
four
miles
south
of
cooperstown
new
york
demand
became
so
overwhelming
that
in
2003
brewery
ommegang
was
sold
to
the
belgium
brewery
responsible
for
duvel
golden
ale
and
now
ommegang
brews
are
made
both
in
belgium
and
cooperstown
this
particular
brew
is
made
in
belgium
is
the
first
beer
produced
by
ommegang
and
was
inspired
by
the
ales
produced
by
the
belgium
trappist
monks
this
beer
pours
nicely
into
a
dark
red
brown
color
with
a
nice
fat
foamy
head
the
aromas
are
full
of
belgium
yeast
as
well
as
some
fruity
and
nutty
notes
the
palate
is
full
and
robust
with
breadiness
that
dissipates
to
fruitiness
as
you
reach
the
exquisite
finish
d
this
is
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
ommegang
abbey
is
a
great
example
of
the
dubbel
style
this
paired
quite
well
with
beer
breadchimay
cheese
and
drunken
goat
cheese
dthis
is
a
fine
example
of
an
abbey
dubbel
ale
deep
and
complex
heavy
yet
still
quite
drinkable
its
a
wonder
that
i
hadnt
stumbled
upon
this
brew
earlier
a
wonderful
belgian
dubbel
style
ale
i
got
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
local
bevmo
it
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
large
fluffy
head
that
lasts
its
has
a
nice
fruity
aroma
backed
by
a
super
sweet
malt
character
its
pretty
heavy
bodied
a
great
dessert
for
after
dinner
i
want
to
like
these
beers
dobles
to
belgians
are
like
browns
are
to
american
styles
not
my
favorite
too
much
malt
to
base
character
ratio
i
made
one
and
was
so
hapy
to
get
the
style
right
but
its
not
my
favorite
style
it
needs
to
be
lighter
higher
in
alcohol
or
both
every
other
style
of
belgian
not
a
bad
double
good
color
but
its
hard
to
like
these
maybe
its
that
sort
of
red
wine
characteristic
that
a
dubbel
should
have
no
business
involving
itself
with
i
think
ommegang
is
a
great
brewery
with
a
lot
to
offer
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
for
me
with
the
american
dubbels
ive
tried
so
far
maybe
i
should
go
back
to
belgians
for
this
category
this
beer
had
no
maltiness
to
speak
of
and
i
believe
that
a
dubbel
should
definitely
have
this
trait
i
must
say
this
is
an
amazing
beer
even
as
an
ipa
lover
this
has
really
turned
me
on
to
the
style
i
look
forward
to
trying
ommegangs
other
beers
in
the
future
this
is
my
first
beer
by
ommegang
overall
im
very
impressed
pours
a
thick
brown
and
lets
no
light
through
at
all
not
much
of
a
foamy
head
but
whats
there
laces
the
sides
nicely
taste
is
of
roasted
nuts
or
even
a
bit
of
chocolate
very
rich
and
powerfull
toffee
also
comes
to
mind
i
like
this
and
will
be
coming
back
for
more
of
this
one
this
is
a
top
10
beer
for
me
verdict
ommegang
abbey
is
a
thoroughly
tasty
proposition
and
nicely
authentic
for
an
american
brewerys
dubbel
well
worth
a
try
d
a
sipper
but
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
you
have
to
remind
yourself
not
to
guzzle
while
you
drink
it
d
a
delicious
dubbel
and
another
fine
beer
from
ommegang
d
very
drinkable
beer
alcohol
is
well
disguised
overall
good
drinkability
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
dubbels
usually
are
nice
fruit
character
in
the
smell
and
flavor
the
alcohol
smell
up
front
is
a
bit
off
putting
but
as
the
beer
warms
it
fades
to
a
strong
dark
fruit
smell
the
end
becomes
a
little
less
sweet
and
a
bitter
flavor
appears
which
helps
to
make
this
a
bit
more
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
better
doubles
i
have
had
i
really
like
aroma
and
the
fruitiness
of
the
flavor
get
this
beer
if
you
can
drinkability
is
high
a
very
tasty
dubbel
that
has
aged
beautifully
drinkability
while
the
flavors
are
amazing
and
the
mouthfeel
is
great
the
abv
really
packed
a
punch
and
therefore
i
have
to
say
its
moderate
a
bit
better
than
average
but
not
quite
mellow
enough
to
be
a
4
on
the
scale
overall
i
will
definitely
be
going
back
for
more
of
this
brew
though
i
really
enjoy
ommegang
beers
as
far
as
per
style
this
beer
hits
the
spot
for
me
personally
im
not
too
in
tune
to
it
notes
this
is
a
treat
fresh
and
i
am
aging
one
too
n
ot
a
knock
your
socks
off
great
but
still
a
nice
beer
bought
a
12
oz
single
of
this
for
about
2
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
with
a
nice
big
head
to
it
some
slight
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
with
aroma
i
pick
up
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
and
other
sweet
smelling
things
which
smell
good
but
cant
quite
distinguish
taste
now
great
mouthfeel
and
body
to
this
one
very
smooth
and
creamy
going
through
the
mouth
again
some
raisinfig
type
of
flavors
with
a
sort
of
spicy
finish
finishes
a
bit
dry
for
my
liking
but
for
its
abv
its
way
too
drinkable
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
good
red
wine
too
lots
of
flavors
going
on
here
and
very
well
balanced
might
be
the
best
american
belgian
ive
tried
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
very
crisp
and
mediumbodied
this
dubbel
is
so
inviting
which
makes
me
say
that
the
drinkability
is
definitely
high
two
thumbs
up
ommegang
cheers
very
good
drinkability
i
noticed
more
flavor
and
smell
come
through
as
it
warmed
i
paid
5
99
for
this
bottle
and
was
very
pleased
i
guess
i
would
buy
it
again
if
given
the
chance
not
an
everyday
drink
definatly
something
special
to
share
with
friends
drinkability
excellent
for
the
style
i
will
certainly
get
this
again
i
love
the
fruity
flavors
drinkability
very
nice
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
nice
stew
d
dangerously
drinkable
in
the
aspect
of
a
dark
strong
ale
try
it
it
will
not
let
you
down
purchased
from
rays
liquor
in
wauwatosa
wi
poured
into
a
snifter
this
beer
was
an
extremely
dark
brown
and
looked
a
bit
hazy
it
had
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
aroma
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
reminiscent
of
a
white
wine
full
bodied
with
flavors
of
molasses
and
brown
sugar
that
lead
to
a
pleasant
warming
aftertaste
in
the
back
of
the
throat
good
drinkability
in
spite
of
the
alcohol
content
go
usa
beat
brazil
a
potent
brew
i
can
only
do
one
glass
before
i
feel
the
effects
but
i
still
love
it
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
ommegang
great
beer
i
will
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
this
around
town
dark
aroma
smells
spicy
some
fruits
darkdried
and
some
sweetness
perhaps
a
carameltoffee
or
sugar
taste
flavor
is
similar
but
with
an
extra
sweetness
to
it
nice
medium
feel
with
a
sweet
taste
ending
with
a
bit
bitter
and
dry
good
feel
enjoyed
drinking
pours
dark
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
stays
the
aroma
is
faint
of
coffee
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
mildly
sweet
and
malty
balanced
well
with
mild
hops
more
sweetness
and
fruit
as
it
warms
very
pleasant
though
i
enjoyed
it
more
from
the
bottle
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
i
will
review
this
beer
again
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
definitely
becomes
more
noticeable
and
the
drinkability
decreases
d
very
high
i
would
buy
this
beer
by
the
case
the
brewmasters
at
ommegang
struck
gold
with
this
brew
prost
drinkability
much
like
a
crisp
and
refreshing
wine
extremely
drinkable
for
a
higher
alcohol
beer
and
for
one
with
such
a
fruity
and
alcoholic
flavor
d
good
drinkability
all
around
a
nice
dubbel
drinkability
for
such
a
complex
ale
to
be
brewed
in
new
york
and
offered
to
the
masses
for
less
than
8
per
bottle
is
a
blessing
if
youre
interested
in
trying
the
belgians
but
are
put
off
by
the
high
prices
try
anything
from
ommegang
it
wont
disappoint
overall
unreal
beer
one
of
my
favorites
thus
far
in
my
beer
adventure
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
yellowish
brownish
color
with
an
explodingly
tight
tan
head
i
still
havent
gotten
my
pour
technique
down
with
these
corked
bottles
just
cant
seem
to
keep
the
mountain
of
foam
away
smells
of
cherries
spices
and
citrusy
sticky
hops
tastes
like
cherries
and
the
malty
spices
come
through
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
on
the
lighter
side
and
hardly
a
hint
of
alcohol
drinkability
is
great
with
the
complexity
coupled
with
a
light
body
notes
this
is
obviously
a
wellmade
beer
that
features
some
good
flavors
that
i
enjoyed
but
this
is
just
way
too
sweet
for
me
very
good
representative
of
the
style
but
dubbels
just
arent
my
cup
of
tea
if
they
are
yours
however
seek
this
one
out
for
sure
of
all
the
flagship
beers
in
america
it
would
be
hard
to
convince
me
that
ommegangs
abbey
ale
isnt
one
of
the
best
it
is
sophisticated
layered
with
aroma
and
flavour
pairs
well
with
a
diverse
range
of
foods
and
above
all
else
is
an
absolute
pleasure
to
sit
down
and
get
to
know
over
the
course
of
an
evening
if
youve
yet
to
become
acquainted
i
suggest
you
introduce
yourself
d
very
drinkable
with
a
well
balanced
but
complex
malt
profile
the
yeast
contributes
the
necessary
fruit
notes
without
any
hot
alcohol
and
the
hops
never
assert
themselves
but
are
still
able
to
contribute
balancing
bitterness
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
the
price
is
pretty
much
impossible
to
beat
this
beer
seems
to
offer
the
sweetness
of
a
quad
but
with
only
the
complexity
of
a
dubbel
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
with
mix
results
sometimes
this
beer
was
way
too
hot
boozy
but
this
one
was
perfectthis
bottle
was
1
5years
old
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
750ml
bottle
split
with
brothecannon
poured
into
a
pair
of
chimay
goblets
this
ale
greets
the
eyes
with
a
hazy
crimson
red
color
with
a
full
inch
and
a
half
of
thick
bubbly
light
tan
head
the
head
lasts
until
the
bottom
of
the
glass
leaving
a
nice
lace
on
the
inside
of
my
glass
with
each
sip
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
fruity
figs
spicy
yeast
caramel
apples
plums
and
bread
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
but
lets
you
know
its
there
worth
a
try
a
few
tries
actually
ommegang
needs
to
start
putting
the
damn
date
on
the
bottle
an
extremely
tasty
beer
but
it
does
seem
to
enforce
limits
on
you
i
can
only
find
them
in
750ml
bottles
around
here
and
two
of
those
is
my
absolute
limit
by
that
point
any
more
is
just
wasting
a
good
beer
because
the
8
5
abv
will
kick
in
eventually
i
also
like
to
enjoy
this
one
with
food
actual
meals
rather
than
just
beer
and
nuts
t
very
fruity
and
malty
dark
fruit
like
figs
honeylike
sweetness
with
a
malty
underpresence
dr
oh
yeah
d
a
fantastic
sipping
beer
hard
to
believe
this
comes
from
a
us
brewery
great
representation
of
the
style
what
a
complex
and
delicious
taste
all
the
other
aspects
of
this
one
are
well
done
but
the
taste
is
something
else
so
smooth
so
tart
so
sweet
so
bitter
this
is
a
beer
i
regularly
buy
highly
recommended
for
any
occasion
very
drinkable
very
crisp
and
fluffy
on
the
palate
poured
this
one
out
of
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
goblet
poured
a
great
dark
red
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
i
really
love
the
color
of
the
beer
but
desired
a
thicker
head
to
round
off
the
appearance
the
smell
was
very
good
mix
of
a
little
tartness
maybe
citrusy
with
something
sweet
hiding
in
the
background
couldnt
quite
put
my
tongue
nose
around
it
though
initial
pour
into
the
mouth
brought
a
real
fruity
palate
swishing
it
around
really
changed
the
taste
stronger
on
the
tip
a
little
sweeter
near
the
back
what
i
really
liked
though
was
the
carbonation
this
beer
really
danced
around
on
my
tongue
which
i
quite
enjoyed
the
alcohol
felt
a
little
too
prominent
though
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
with
any
great
regularity
definitely
worth
checking
out
the
mouth
is
good
medium
body
high
carbonation
very
smooth
alcohol
is
nonexistant
nice
this
beer
goes
down
damn
smooth
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
d
extremely
drinkable
would
i
drink
more
hell
yes
i
believe
everyone
should
experience
this
one
i
would
even
say
you
should
share
this
with
a
friend
the
entire
750ml
bottle
weighing
in
at
8
5
abv
is
leaving
me
feeling
good
d
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
ommegang
is
a
good
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
deal
with
so
much
flavor
at
once
d
this
is
a
unique
take
on
a
dubbel
this
is
almost
a
cross
between
a
dubbel
and
a
flanders
redsour
ale
it
works
for
me
first
of
all
im
not
that
big
into
dubbels
however
i
had
to
give
this
beer
a
try
based
solely
on
what
a
fantastic
beer
hennepin
is
poured
a
chestnut
brown
with
maroon
highlights
visible
when
held
to
light
big
rich
and
creamy
head
smell
was
rich
with
malt
and
hinting
of
dried
fruit
and
spices
the
taste
confirmed
the
scent
dates
raisins
and
plums
were
most
prevalent
the
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
was
fantastic
and
carbonation
was
spot
on
i
liked
that
this
was
a
little
less
sweet
than
other
dubbels
ive
had
this
brew
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
it
again
a
very
fine
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
if
someone
asked
me
to
provide
them
an
american
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
i
would
have
a
hard
time
coming
up
with
a
better
one
had
this
in
a
bomber
at
white
dog
cafe
in
philly
poured
a
dark
amber
purple
color
with
a
nice
cream
colored
head
smell
was
very
malty
and
lightly
fruity
maybe
grapes
with
a
slight
bitter
hoppy
note
and
spices
as
well
taste
was
super
smooth
medium
body
with
perfect
medium
carbonation
faintly
fruity
taste
with
strong
malt
and
faint
caramel
notes
nice
balanced
hoppy
finish
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
beer
excellent
to
have
with
dinner
fantastic
beer
but
not
overly
complicated
so
as
to
complement
a
meal
d
good
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
able
to
drink
two
bombers
its
heavy
but
delicious
this
is
a
good
drink
this
beer
has
a
lot
to
offer
to
both
veterans
and
those
unaccustomed
to
dubbels
i
will
pick
it
up
again
if
im
in
the
mood
not
my
favorite
dubbel
brothers
thelonius
is
more
enjoyable
to
me
d
it
may
be
that
i
just
got
off
work
and
was
dying
for
a
beer
but
this
was
much
easier
to
drink
than
i
expected
its
something
that
id
have
to
remember
to
pace
myself
with
or
i
could
see
an
evening
with
these
ending
in
disorderly
conduct
unbecoming
of
a
lady
poured
a
deep
red
dark
and
clear
beautiful
thick
head
strong
fruity
aroma
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
beneath
taste
has
strong
cherry
undertones
and
is
surprisingly
sweet
strong
carbonation
detracts
a
little
from
the
mouthfeel
in
my
opinion
the
taste
remains
fruity
and
caramelly
true
to
the
scent
all
the
way
down
and
the
sweetness
remains
for
a
bit
after
the
beer
is
gone
quite
satisfying
pours
a
rich
dark
body
with
nice
lacing
smells
sweet
on
the
nose
with
honey
and
burnt
sugar
it
is
light
to
the
scent
with
deep
perfuming
scents
of
malt
on
the
taste
it
is
complex
and
smooth
with
deep
malts
and
a
good
bit
of
fruit
it
is
spicy
and
dry
on
the
finish
and
still
refreshing
great
carbonation
and
not
as
fullbodied
as
the
color
would
denote
i
paid
6
bucks
for
this
because
i
spent
the
rest
of
my
money
on
westmalle
tripel
with
that
being
said
it
is
a
tremendous
beer
notes
overall
pretty
mellow
dubbel
easy
drinking
and
certainly
delicious
in
my
opinion
not
quite
as
flavorful
and
brother
thelonious
an
amazing
beer
definitely
a
new
favorite
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
ever
had
i
dont
own
a
cave
but
maybe
i
better
start
storing
some
abbey
ales
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
a
memorable
beer
drinking
experience
from
the
bottle
this
pours
a
murky
carmel
color
thick
and
dark
with
a
scant
offwhite
head
and
bits
of
lacing
the
aroma
brings
spritzy
sweet
malt
and
root
with
some
chocolate
hints
pleasant
and
decided
and
very
nice
the
flavor
is
a
very
good
brown
bread
molasses
and
a
touch
of
clove
there
is
some
toffee
and
licorice
but
tons
of
malt
here
brown
sugar
sweetness
in
a
medium
body
drinkable
brew
fine
carbonation
very
satisying
as
a
substitute
for
dessert
but
may
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
some
situations
or
tastes
very
good
and
well
worth
a
try
like
most
ommegangs
no
issues
with
a
750ml
bottle
could
easily
continue
onto
a
second
very
drinnkable
highly
recommened
overall
you
should
be
drinking
this
right
now
go
buy
a
bottle
its
not
that
expensive
go
now
stop
reading
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
suprisd
its
not
overrated
smooth
and
easy
for
how
stong
the
abv
is
m
and
d
mediumbodied
with
tons
of
yummy
carbonation
though
the
beer
is
still
smooth
going
down
so
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
really
sneaks
up
i
look
forward
to
cracking
open
another
750
soon
d
tremendously
drinkable
not
something
that
you
would
want
to
drink
all
night
but
that
is
not
what
this
is
for
seems
to
me
to
be
a
perfect
desert
in
itself
or
something
to
accompany
a
rich
chocolatey
desert
maybe
topped
with
raspberries
mmm
now
im
hungry
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
complex
array
of
brooding
autumnal
flavours
although
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
finish
it
really
only
lingers
theres
nothing
unpleasant
flavourwise
on
the
back
of
the
palate
in
fact
the
more
i
drink
the
more
im
thinking
the
tartness
is
just
a
nice
fruity
character
i
might
mark
it
up
12
a
point
i
might
not
overall
a
good
brew
but
not
something
im
seeking
out
again
especially
with
allagash
dubble
on
the
market
which
slams
this
brew
in
my
opinion
the
flavor
only
confirms
my
suspicion
that
this
beer
passed
through
some
level
of
filtration
and
was
then
reinnoculated
it
just
seems
too
boring
for
a
truly
unfiltered
belgian
still
a
great
beer
and
worth
checking
out
if
you
have
not
d
high
a
good
dubbel
but
not
a
great
one
full
bodied
and
complex
with
good
carbonation
and
a
medium
finish
a
pretty
good
dubbel
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
definitely
worth
a
try
though
served
from
a
twenty
four
ounce
bomber
pours
nice
with
a
three
finger
head
that
dissipates
slowly
with
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
very
fruity
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
the
beer
is
fairly
carbonated
very
good
first
sip
with
fruits
and
malts
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mixes
well
with
the
fruitiness
and
keeps
the
beer
interesting
at
5
69
a
bottle
this
beer
is
very
good
value
for
the
price
considering
the
cost
of
other
abbeys
highly
recommended
the
price
of
this
at
6
along
with
the
general
solidity
of
this
beer
might
make
this
a
go
to
belgian
for
all
to
enjoy
recommended
all
and
all
a
great
beer
you
can
see
why
this
is
in
the
upper
echeleon
of
beers
final
thoughts
definitely
purchase
this
beer
and
give
it
a
try
my
favorite
of
the
dubbel
style
each
new
drinking
experience
provides
new
flavors
and
additional
character
very
affordable
at
66
50
for
750
ml
bottle
after
trying
hennepin
right
before
this
i
must
say
ommegang
has
something
really
good
going
they
create
brews
that
could
rival
true
belgians
this
particular
brew
was
very
dark
in
color
but
light
in
flavor
and
body
very
nice
and
complex
d
i
dont
drink
too
many
belgians
theyre
something
im
trying
to
get
into
more
this
was
pretty
well
balanced
very
intense
flavor
though
i
felt
it
was
too
boozy
overall
an
excellent
beer
ill
probably
have
to
give
it
another
try
smells
of
dark
fruit
and
sugar
tastes
not
far
off
plums
brown
sugar
and
almost
a
buttery
aftertaste
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
not
overly
carbonated
or
too
flat
good
mouthfeel
pretty
potent
stuff
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
drinkability
a
rich
enough
flavor
that
one
is
very
drinkable
but
one
a
night
is
enough
glad
to
see
an
american
beer
that
can
hold
its
own
with
the
belgians
i
can
see
why
this
brewery
has
received
the
accolades
it
has
and
it
deserves
them
taste
the
flavors
are
fairly
fruity
and
herbal
dried
cherries
cloves
and
more
raisins
this
beer
definitely
delivers
pours
a
cloudy
very
dark
burnt
copper
with
warm
reddish
edges
and
billowing
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
sweet
smells
of
raisins
and
molasses
with
a
nice
yeastiness
a
taste
that
makes
me
throw
both
hands
in
the
air
shoots
scores
this
beer
is
right
on
the
money
a
complex
array
multilayered
maltsrich
toffee
and
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
dates
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
body
is
very
finely
carbonated
and
holds
together
in
a
way
that
allows
you
to
appreciate
its
heft
whereas
some
dubbels
are
overcarbonated
and
practically
explode
on
the
tongue
without
giving
you
the
chance
to
savor
the
flavors
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
spicy
medium
body
and
warm
the
finish
slightly
bitter
and
medium
finish
the
beer
is
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
body
to
me
is
not
quite
there
it
has
a
nice
rounded
and
spicy
flavor
to
the
beer
like
this
one
a
lot
while
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sweetness
of
some
dubbels
i
feel
like
i
miss
it
a
bit
in
this
one
but
i
suppose
its
a
nice
break
from
the
routine
definitely
worth
a
look
ommegang
seems
to
consistently
have
the
best
beers
in
the
belgian
style
outside
of
belgium
d
4
0
its
a
rich
intense
dubbel
experience
i
like
the
higher
than
usual
carbo
but
this
one
is
a
sipper
given
its
dense
dark
fruit
notes
not
a
session
beer
in
my
book
but
a
solid
dubbel
for
sure
dark
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rich
slow
fading
head
aroma
is
dark
fruit
taste
is
the
same
dark
fruitsugar
cane
and
caramel
this
is
the
fourth
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
i
have
enjoyed
them
all
something
i
believe
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
recommended
and
i
would
buy
again
d
this
beer
goes
down
so
smoothly
and
so
nicely
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
hope
i
can
find
some
more
ommegang
around
here
drinkability
a
very
good
belgian
but
hardly
ommegangs
best
not
terrible
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
struggled
because
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
but
i
cant
forgive
the
weak
nose
a
truly
excellent
and
enjoyable
beer
quite
complex
but
very
smooth
and
drinkable
as
well
possibly
one
of
the
most
drinkable
dubbels
ive
ever
tried
this
one
yet
again
established
ommegang
as
a
topnotch
brewery
with
me
d
excellent
drinkability
as
with
a
friend
split
a
2
liter
growler
over
the
course
of
day
drinkability
is
high
and
i
could
enjoy
this
any
time
of
the
year
in
probably
any
situation
a
750ml
bottle
dark
brown
in
color
carbonation
evident
through
the
dark
color
small
cream
colored
head
which
fades
somewhat
quickly
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
a
rush
of
fruits
and
sweet
malt
very
syrupy
taste
like
maple
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
smooth
finish
not
very
drinkable
one
is
more
than
enough
to
be
sipped
over
an
extended
time
frame
almost
tastes
like
cough
syrup
after
awhile
poured
into
sturdy
chalice
poured
a
deep
dark
reddishbrown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
left
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
an
assertive
fruity
nose
with
a
slight
spice
aroma
the
flavors
follow
the
aromas
with
the
fruity
taste
prominent
on
the
front
of
tongue
and
a
lovely
spice
finish
a
full
balanced
wellrounded
body
that
wants
to
curl
up
and
snuggle
with
you
a
versatile
drinkability
if
youre
just
having
one
with
dinner
or
several
with
other
activities
an
absolutely
marvelous
beer
either
as
a
treat
or
a
daily
staple
poured
from
750ml
bottle
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
tons
of
frothy
off
white
head
smell
is
sweet
and
all
candy
malty
scents
taste
is
very
sweet
and
in
your
face
belgium
malt
yeast
and
cane
sugar
sweetness
taste
is
bold
but
leaves
the
palate
quickly
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
that
really
coats
the
mouth
this
is
extremely
drinkable
as
im
easily
putting
down
this
bottle
alone
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
very
good
belgian
style
ale
brewery
ommegang
says
every
bottle
is
worthy
of
celebration
i
concur
if
you
havent
tasted
this
get
one
now
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
huge
rocky
head
that
rises
about
a
half
inch
above
the
top
of
the
snifter
before
settling
into
a
thick
collar
that
sticks
a
lot
of
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
mascerated
fruit
candy
sugar
and
raisins
very
little
hop
in
the
nose
tastes
exactly
like
the
smell
with
a
good
hit
of
warming
alcohol
on
the
back
end
has
an
almost
vinous
quality
tons
of
seltzery
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
a
really
nice
alternative
to
the
pricey
trappist
brews
good
stuff
d
fine
dubbel
with
plenty
of
complexities
this
was
actually
my
first
ommegang
believe
it
or
not
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
1
12
finger
tan
head
smelled
the
malt
sweetness
upfront
with
a
strong
aroma
of
brown
sugar
and
some
raisins
taste
was
good
but
left
a
medicinal
aftertaste
that
was
overly
pleasant
beer
smoothed
out
as
it
warmed
carbonation
was
fine
and
the
body
was
as
expected
drinkability
was
ok
for
me
one
maybe
two
for
me
a
really
nice
take
on
the
style
though
i
would
like
to
see
just
a
shade
more
sweetness
and
a
hair
less
tangy
yeast
pours
a
dark
redbrownblack
tannish
white
head
very
fine
bubbles
creamy
looking
good
lacing
very
lasting
very
flowery
alcoholy
syrupy
sweet
strong
floral
taste
dark
fruits
like
plum
and
a
walnutty
taste
nutty
aftertaste
not
very
alcoholy
which
is
good
not
as
hoppy
or
floral
a
taste
more
malty
more
tempered
as
it
warms
up
dability
not
overwhelming
for
an
8
5
abv
beer
and
the
relatively
dry
finish
enhances
the
drinkability
better
then
the
bottle
i
thought
yes
sacrilege
i
know
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
i
feel
that
its
a
definite
down
grade
from
the
three
philosophers
that
ommegang
puts
out
but
still
this
is
a
great
beer
definitely
very
fruity
malty
and
tasty
goodness
worth
trying
and
worth
trying
again
this
brewery
puts
out
continuously
some
of
the
best
examples
of
american
belgian
beers
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
recommend
that
all
try
and
if
they
have
i
recommend
they
try
some
more
d
i
think
im
still
working
on
an
ideal
pour
even
pouring
slow
but
with
enough
speed
to
get
a
head
going
these
ommegang
bombers
seem
to
be
a
little
too
bubbly
for
my
taste
ive
also
tried
pouring
too
strongly
in
the
past
and
it
ends
up
flat
heres
to
continued
practice
all
that
said
i
think
a
bomber
will
be
a
fine
amount
and
go
down
quite
enjoyably
i
thought
this
was
ok
and
it
is
one
of
the
few
bargains
remaining
in
the
craft
beer
aisle
of
discount
liquor
but
id
still
be
reluctant
to
recommend
a
thick
and
rich
beer
with
a
strong
carbonation
to
complement
feels
awesome
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
at
8
5
the
flavor
has
some
rough
edges
but
its
pretty
accessible
even
through
its
deep
complexities
overall
a
wonderful
beer
to
have
around
at
a
reasonable
price
i
personally
love
it
md
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
ny
first
dubbel
so
i
can
not
raealy
compare
to
the
style
all
i
can
say
is
i
have
not
been
let
down
by
ommegangn
they
continue
to
impress
again
i
seemed
to
be
impressed
by
this
brewery
and
hope
to
visit
it
someday
with
such
stellar
beers
coming
from
them
a
deep
amber
to
a
red
color
with
a
beige
color
an
inch
thick
and
has
incredible
sustainablity
a
malty
sweetness
is
dominant
in
the
scent
with
touches
of
yeasty
bread
with
bit
of
sugary
sweet
fruitness
the
taste
starts
with
a
strong
malt
flavor
with
a
yeasty
fruitiness
a
dried
fruit
sweetness
and
finishing
with
a
mild
bitterness
a
creamy
teaxture
with
a
bit
of
chwiness
it
leaves
the
palate
dryand
clean
this
is
a
well
made
dubble
bring
that
maltiness
in
the
flavor
the
creaminess
in
the
feel
and
the
yeasty
esters
those
aspects
make
this
a
must
try
beer
from
a
great
american
brewery
if
you
like
this
style
youll
likely
love
this
beer
recommended
and
worth
the
price
deep
red
to
bronzed
color
mostly
opaque
the
head
comprised
of
lots
of
miniscule
bubbles
slow
to
fade
sits
there
like
moving
isnt
in
the
picture
mixture
of
fresh
black
fruits
and
glazed
fruits
in
the
nose
more
raw
brown
sugar
than
manipulated
sweetness
maybe
some
fresh
honey
the
roasted
malts
build
as
it
warms
scents
more
smooth
than
invasive
mediumbodied
very
balanced
for
its
weight
gives
it
a
semirelentless
character
here
the
red
cherry
raspberry
golden
raisin
flavors
ring
more
clearly
not
fruity
per
se
but
youd
have
to
be
a
moron
not
to
taste
the
fruit
as
a
result
the
roast
is
sweeter
with
more
caramel
notes
carbonation
level
is
average
more
upfront
dies
off
feels
like
a
wellworn
autumnal
blazer
nothing
fancy
anymore
but
moves
where
and
when
you
want
it
to
truncated
end
worrisome
though
this
beer
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorites
there
are
loads
of
flavors
to
be
explored
in
this
brew
it
seems
like
i
find
something
new
every
time
i
revisit
this
classic
standbeside
brew
worth
the
50
something
a
case
also
when
set
down
for
a
year
of
so
it
becomes
quite
divine
and
the
layers
of
flavor
really
develop
and
the
alcohol
taste
take
a
backseat
do
yourself
a
favor
and
go
pick
some
up
frankly
this
beer
is
fing
fantastic
the
beer
has
a
good
carbonation
level
to
it
in
addition
to
its
medium
body
the
beer
is
fairly
rich
creamy
and
smooth
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
but
the
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
and
it
is
noticeable
after
two
overall
this
is
an
excellent
if
not
exception
beer
highly
recommended
and
i
think
that
i
will
be
heading
to
the
beer
store
to
try
it
bottled
impressed
very
good
brew
and
one
of
my
top
six
by
style
drinkability
is
good
for
such
a
strong
and
complex
beer
a
lot
of
strong
tastes
that
all
balance
each
other
well
nice
beer
that
pairs
with
a
lot
of
different
foods
very
well
simply
superior
m
high
carbonation
very
high
decent
mouthfeel
crisp
and
very
dry
not
a
favorite
of
mine
trying
to
appreciate
the
style
but
thats
about
it
na
zdravje
mouthfeel
is
slick
crisp
goes
down
very
smooth
leaves
a
little
bit
of
an
oily
feel
on
my
palate
although
sweet
its
not
overboard
and
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
for
its
abv
an
excellent
dubbel
as
ommegang
never
ever
disappoints
d
decent
but
a
little
sweet
and
thick
to
be
sessionable
good
mouth
feel
with
a
warm
lingering
candy
taste
beer
was
true
to
style
for
an
american
abbey
ale
i
opened
a
bottle
and
poured
some
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
nice
burgundy
color
with
a
decent
pale
tan
head
the
head
didnt
last
very
long
and
there
wasnt
much
lacing
smelled
of
figs
and
dates
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
it
has
flavors
of
sweetened
dried
fruit
reminded
me
of
apples
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
abbey
ale
and
believe
it
could
go
down
a
bit
too
easy
t
a
delicious
dubbel
that
is
easy
to
find
and
a
decent
deal
at
5
99750ml
an
excellent
beer
at
a
great
price
drinkable
and
complex
an
exceptional
belgian
ale
as
for
drinkability
i
cant
knock
it
too
much
over
personal
taste
but
i
would
not
buy
this
one
again
at
6750ml
this
is
a
real
value
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
from
ommegang
might
be
worthy
for
the
carbonade
but
id
add
more
and
reduce
it
if
substituting
for
a
westmalle
double
no
worries
about
bitterness
building
when
cooking
with
this
id
like
to
put
some
down
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
if
the
complexity
builds
i
very
seriously
considering
getting
a
bottle
but
at
17
was
just
too
much
they
seem
to
have
plenty
of
it
so
if
its
still
available
in
a
few
months
ill
pick
some
up
they
also
said
they
are
getting
ready
to
retrieve
some
cave
aged
hennepin
soon
and
that
their
new
tripel
is
done
just
waiting
to
go
out
maybe
waiting
on
a
label
approval
taste
is
smooth
prunes
raisins
touch
of
cherry
some
cocoa
burnt
toffee
some
malt
ends
thick
somewhat
bitter
and
tangy
on
the
tongue
pours
a
deep
ruby
amber
hue
beneath
a
great
twofinger
beige
head
the
foam
linger
as
a
nice
film
herbal
toasted
malt
is
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
very
bready
with
some
belgian
brewing
spices
in
this
nose
pleasantly
sweet
caramel
notes
drizzled
on
sweet
wheat
bread
a
little
viney
towards
the
finish
great
carbonation
helps
enhance
all
the
flavors
of
this
beer
upping
the
complexity
and
drinkability
of
this
8
5
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
very
foamy
tan
head
smell
has
some
sweet
notes
and
fruity
characters
some
strong
spices
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
some
yeasty
smells
taste
starts
spicy
them
moves
to
many
fruity
notes
then
finishes
with
some
yeast
notes
and
alcohol
tones
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
a
subtle
fruit
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
nice
balance
of
many
flavors
a
medium
light
body
with
nice
carbonation
this
beer
has
nice
drinkability
a
higher
abv
might
be
a
reason
not
to
have
too
many
but
a
quality
beer
with
great
flavor
definitely
a
beer
to
check
out
this
was
one
of
the
first
u
s
microbrews
i
ever
had
and
i
remember
initially
picking
it
up
only
because
it
was
a
belgianstyle
alethe
kind
of
beer
that
made
me
turn
a
corner
and
the
sort
of
beer
i
was
obsessed
with
for
awhile
it
probably
tasted
more
exotic
to
me
in
those
greener
days
but
wow
this
is
still
wonderful
rated
aug

d
overall
a
sipper
brew
but
still
very
smooth
and
drinkable
this
is
good
beer
coolly
solid
across
the
head
like
planed
wood
shavings
on
a
workbench
made
from
something
heavy
but
in
this
context
easily
moved
with
a
light
puff
of
air
a
solid
brown
color
gives
way
to
shafts
of
ruby
and
amber
each
containing
a
defining
characteristic
of
the
beer
once
this
ceiling
is
broken
though
its
like
biting
into
a
piece
of
fleshy
fruit
dry
but
growing
juicy
seemingly
filling
your
mouth
with
carmelized
sweetness
light
airy
and
pretty
stimulating
and
deceptively
strong
with
only
a
mild
hint
of
alcohol
almost
an
undercurrent
enveloping
your
tongue
d
the
complex
flavor
is
enjoyable
but
the
high
abv
and
carbonation
mean
only
one
per
sitting
for
me
very
nice
brew
and
a
wonderful
introduction
for
me
into
the
belgium
ales
even
with
its
higher
abv
this
could
be
a
real
nice
beer
for
a
long
evening
overall
i
really
enjoyed
my
second
offering
from
ommegang
and
look
forward
to
sampling
more
had
this
750
ml
corked
bottle
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
a
couple
weeks
before
breaking
it
out
late
night
after
a
movie
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
in
a
tulip
glass
with
a
thick
almost
two
inches
thick
solid
foam
a
caramel
raisin
sweetness
on
the
nose
and
the
initial
taste
was
one
of
sweet
raisins
and
yeast
very
much
in
the
forefront
really
dominating
the
malt
and
hops
maybe
a
little
roasted
malt
in
there
the
flavor
was
a
also
a
little
bread
like
and
the
yeast
had
a
certain
zippy
spiciness
to
it
liked
the
complexity
to
this
one
and
really
enjoyed
this
one
d
i
dont
think
the
sweetness
is
overdone
there
is
a
nice
balance
though
it
is
a
strong
beer
ill
temper
this
review
with
a
disclaimer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
dubbels
here
we
go
pours
dark
burgundy
almost
opaque
the
head
is
huge
and
takes
a
while
to
settle
aroma
of
overripe
apples
and
sugar
taste
is
sharp
at
first
then
mellows
into
sweet
malts
and
the
baked
apple
and
honey
flavors
sticky
sweet
but
good
enough
d
all
said
and
done
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
as
the
bottle
states
it
can
be
cellared
and
i
think
a
little
cellar
time
may
do
wonders
to
balance
everything
out
the
8
5
abv
is
masked
remarkably
well
and
for
a
dubbel
this
drinks
very
easily
not
in
a
hurry
to
buy
more
but
definitely
a
worthy
candidate
for
cellaring
i
can
tell
its
a
good
beer
just
not
ready
yet
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
creamy
slight
beige
head
lots
of
yeast
floating
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
of
cherry

spice

nice
amount
of

tart

spicy

drink

many
of

while

abv
this
one
can
easily
sneak
up
on
you
d
ended
up
giving
this
average
drinkability
mostly
because
i
ended
up
confused
on
this
beer
it
is
very
distinctive
and
i
could
see
loving
it
and
wanting
to
come
back
again
and
again
at
the
same
time
i
am
probably
going
to
wait
awhile
because
of
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
below
average
not
too
different
from
delerium
nocturnum
if
you
like
that
but
way
too
sweet
for
me
drinkability
fair
no
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
but
not
sufficiently
impressed
to
want
more
d
well
i
do
know
that
i
probably
wont
get
through
all
750ml
of
this
beer
the
phenols
actually
make
this
a
little
sickening
here
during
my
second
glass
this
may
be
destined
for
a
drain
pour
i
will
def
try
this
one
again
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
rich
tasting
and
very
full
of
flavor
the
head
pours
about
1
5
inches
thick
and
it
stays
in
a
nice
cold
frosty
mug
for
a
long
time
it
is
the
best
bang
for
the
buck
beer
when
it
comes
to
pricetasteabv
when
i
want
to
impress
anyone
i
bring
a
4
pack
over
and
have
never
had
anyone
say
anything
negative
about
this
beer
when
it
comes
to
great
taste
and
value
this
beer
beats
them
all
if
you
have
never
tried
this
beer
you
are
missing
out
on
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
made
d
a
nice
belgian
style
ale
from
here
in
the
states
and
a
good
deal
as
well
acquired
this
highly
anticipated
brew
during
a
recent
road
trip
to
texas
a
deep
dark
brown
brew
sits
under
a
fluffy
tan
head
retention
is
excellent
as
the
bubbles
pop
and
the
head
slowly
fades
a
craggly
lacing
is
left
behind
nose
is
somewhat
unique
and
spicy
with
raisins
sugar
and
notes
of
taffy
present
tastes
of
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
grainy
at
first
with
an
earthy
essence
mixed
into
the
equation
a
slight
but
lingering
bitterness
resolves
things
in
the
end
this
one
isnt
too
big
on
the
carbonation
with
only
a
slight
burst
of
bubbles
upon
a
good
shake
this
brew
doesnt
weigh
too
much
on
the
palate
and
actually
floats
just
a
bit
resulting
in
a
tasty
yet
quite
drinkable
experience
well
done
pours
a
nice
ruby
color
thick
head
at
the
start
but
diminishes
and
almost
no
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
with
peppery
notes
flavor
is
similar
to
that
with
a
bit
more
of
a
metallic
tang
than
i
would
prefer
flavors
also
bring
out
some
fruit
i
prefer
the
3
philos
to
this
one
pours
a
reddish
cherry
with
low
transparency
on
top
sits
a
three
finger
tall
almond
cap

delicious
looking
froth
the

the
flavors
are
in
line
with
the
noseleaning
toward
the
caramelized
dark

and
alcohol
side
of
the
spectrum
i
taste
a
bit
of
spicy
pepperim
sure
its
the
yeast
the
body
is
medium
to
light
and
could
have
a
bit
more
assertivenessalthough
its
not
a
wimp
either
bubbly
carbonated
feel
with
a
very
softyet
lingering
sugary
stickiness
this
lacks
the
captivatingit
factor
for
my
tastes
a
very
good
abbey
none
the
less
drinkability
really
nice
warming
and
hearty
despite
a
lackluster
nose
a
really
fine
beer
one
can
easily
get
their
hands
on
i
popped
open
a
750
ml
bottle
and
poured
some
into
tulip
glass
it
pours
a
pleasant
burgundy
color
with
abundant
white
head
the
head
leaves
quickly
sans
lacing
this
abbey
ale
smells
of
drunken
figs
and
dates
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
it
has
flavors
of
sweetened
dried
fruit
with
a
phenolic
finish
a
crisp
and
dry
ale
a
nice
medium
bodied
sipper
that
if
you
do
not
watch
out
could
suprise
you
with
its
8

abv
d
a
marvelous
brew
that
is
enjoyable
as
a
nightcap
or
dessert
beer
and
probably
any
other
time
as
well
d
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
some
solid
flavours
notes
yet
another
great
offering
from
brewery
ommegang
and
a
great
way
to
honor
the
belgian
tradition
of
brewing
dont
drink
and
review
the
aroma
was
spicy
with
some
fruit
tones
coming
through
the
taste
was
full
of
brown
sugar
fruit
and
a
super
spicy
finish
it
was
less
than
average
carbonated
and
didnt
leave
much
of
a
mark
in
the
mouth
overall
i
thought
it
was
good
but
not
great
i
will
give
it
a
try
in
a
few
months
a
complex
offering
that
revels
so
many
different
flavors
and
a
joy
to
sip
a
little
boozy
but
not
overpowering
and
for
the
price
its
outstanding
ommegang
does
belgium
right
color
is
a
dark
brown
amber
with
a
thick
foamy
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
various
fruits
with
a
smoked
winteresque
feel
a
thick
lace
of
foam
retains
with
the
beer
long
after
the
pour
giving
the
beer
a
swill
more
volatiles
are
released
evoking
the
sweet
aromas
of
banana
and
fruit
pie
taste
produces
a
mouthful
of
wonderful
flavor
fruits
spices
and
hops
abound
the
palate
with
a
slight
alcoholheavy
aftertaste
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
becomes
alive
producing
an
entirely
different
feel
and
texture
the
one
downside
of
this
ale
is
its
8
5
abv
on
what
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
overall
a
fine
specimen
and
another
reason
why
ommegang
continues
to
live
up
to
all
the
hype
this
beer
is
totally
disappointing
its
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
but
aroma
and
flavor
are
just
largely
not
present
its
neutral
the
way
that
guinness
is
neutral
to
an
experienced
drinker
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
the
general
style
then
its
a
strong
flavor
but
i
just
expect
more
character
then
this
from
an
abbey
ale
there
is
a
slight
after
taste
of
pennies
which
is
annoying
but
even
that
is
so
faint
its
nearly
not
there
its
very
drinkable
because
its
neutral
but
not
actually
good
have
it
with
food
instead
of
diet
soda
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
tasty
looking
cashew
colored
head
a
little
too
cloudy
to
see
any
carbonation
etc
smells
malty
and
sweet
with
some
dark
fruits
and
spices
taste
reminds
me
of
a
good
ryewheat
bread
or
more
like
a
fruit
breadfruit
cake
youd
get
around
the
holidays
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
dubbels
ive
had
feel
is
a
tiny
bit
on
full
the
side
of
medium
and
a
little
sticky
i
am
consistently
impressed
with
ommegang
i
tried
all
of
their
beers
at
a
festival
once
but
it
was
late
and
inappropriate
setting
experience
the
magnificence
of
this
brewery
its
since
ive
joined
ba
that
ive
really
gotten
into
these
beers
hennepin
is
a
staple
in
my
kitchen
now
and
ive
had
fun
with
three
philosophers
too
had
some
with
sweet
potato
fries
once
great
pairing
i
think
im
gonna
go
scoop
up
some
ommegeddon
one
of
the
few
i
havent
tried
after
work
tomorrow
fantastic
beers
at
a
really
friendly
price
md
i
liked
the
level
of
carbonation
which
is
pretty
high
and
sticks
in
the
throat
during
swallow
should
be
expected
from
the
head
you
get
when
you
pour
though
this
beer
is
way
too
heavy
and
high
in
alcohol
content
to
drink
many
but
damn
is
it
good
ommegang
strikes
me
as
just
an
allaround
awesome
brewing
company
who
else
can
offer
6
750s
of
kickass
belgianstyle
beer
and
in
this
economy
no
less
ill
take
this
over
a
near7
sixer
of
domestic
swill
any
day
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
brew
another
tasty
offering
from
ommegang
my
favorite
brewery
at
the
moment
its
a
good
beer
specially
for
the
price
d
abv
is
8
5
could
have
a
couple
not
a
lot
though
what
a
beer
for
6
an
amazingly
complex
brew
i
dont
know
how
much
this
is
different
from
the
regular
non
caveaged
but
i
intend
to
find
out
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
three
in
an
hour
though
it
has
some
kick
d
finer
carbonation
would
help
drinkability
more
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
nice
flavor
wonderful
aroma
and
it
looks
great
its
an
affordable
domestically
produced
belgianstyle
beer
that
ill
be
buying
again
drinkability
for
this
is
pretty
high
for
me
nice
overall
beer
which
i
would
purchase
again
excellent
beer
pours
beautiful
dark
and
creamy
with
a
fantastic
head
smells
and
tastes
like
a
belgian
beer
what
can
i
say
that
means
its
good
excellent
balance
alcohol
is
blended
very
well
but
gets
to
you
after
a
whole
bottle
thats
okay
though
ill
be
getting
another
one
of
these
for
sure
to
put
back
to
back
with
the
chimay
blue
recommended
for
sure
to
this
point
it
is
my
favorite
ommegang
which
speaks
a
lot
went
beautifully
with
blue
cheese
covered
home
made
pizza
with
balsamic
fig
glaze
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
sipper
and
a
solid
treat
should
be
a
staple
in
anyones
fridge
it
does
everything
well
d
this
is
beer
is
like
dessert
to
me
while
i
could
drink
another
one
without
any
problem
it
seems
like
it
would
be
overkill
a
great
bomber
that
improves
as
it
warms
and
leaves
you
seeking
the
next
sampling
i
feel
like
i
drank
a
different
beer
than
everyone
else
reviewing
it
the
beer
that
everyone
else
describes
sounds
incredible
so
feel
free
to
ignore
my
review
but
i
can
only
go
on
my
own
experience
poured
into
my
chimay
chalice
this
deep
amber
brown
liquid
produced
a
shallow
off
white
head
the
smell
of
malt
and
bready
yeast
is
the
first
introduction
to
this
wonderful
brew
the
taste
is
up
front
maltwith
somthing
of
a
plum
type
naturefinishing
with
a
sourdough
yeast
like
bread
component
nice
carbonation
to
clear
the
palate
for
the
next
sip
no
apparent
alcohol
presents
for
the
8
5
its
hiding
dubbel
done
well
i
love
this
brewery
ps
i
was
drunk
when
i
wrote
this
another
reason
to
love
those
strong
abbey
ales
nice
beer
that
isnt
to
tart
or
sweet
but
very
balanced
and
full
not
my
favorite
dubbel
but
one
of
the
best
americans
dprobably
not
something
im
going
to
drink
a
ton
of
in
one
sitting
but
thats
not
the
point
a
single
bomber
poured
slow
and
savored
is
better
than
even
a
pot
of
tea
for
these
cooling
temperatures
and
the
color
show
they
bring
to
the
northeast
so
damn
satisfying
very
good
example
of
the
dubbel
style
well
done
ommegang
little
to
no
heat
for
such
a
strong
ale
the
drinkability
on
this
is
amazing
i
could
guzzle
it
easily
and
i
look
forward
to
each
sip
greatest
beer
for
your
dollar
deep
dark
red
color
with
a
small
head
that
clings
not
a
very
pungent
aroma
but
indeed
pleasing
some
citrus
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
earthy
and
medicinal
with
a
dry
aftertaste
theres
dark
sweet
notes
as
well
that
float
in
and
out
of
the
streams
of
alcohol
and
touches
of
black
pepper
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
could
do
very
well
accompanying
cuisines
with
lots
of
spice
think
asian
or
indian
a
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
drank
slowly
to
savor
the
flavors

alcoholic
kick

the
8
5
abv
is
not
a
factor
here
and
the
bottle
goes
by
very
quickly
tasty
complex
quite
drinkable
very
good
choice
here
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a

in

candy
sugar
and
a
small

in
the
taste
candy
sugar
stands
out
small
fruit
and
a
sweet
maltiness
a
smooth
and
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
fruity
banana
like
aftertaste
very
similar
to
a
true
belgian
although
heavy
on
candy
sugar
but
very
nice
this
was
not
a
beer
for
me
i
have
had
dubbels
before
and
enjoyed
them
but
this
one
had
too
much
going
on
for
my
tastes
the
cherry
flavor
was
too
strong
and
reminded
me
of
childrens
cough
syrup
i
had
to
force
myself
to
finish
the
glass
because
of
this
and
while
i
may
give
it
another
shot
to
be
fair
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
much
more
of
this
another
belgian
success
story
from
brewery
ommegang
this
dubbel
was
sweet
fruity
and
aromatic
just
as
described
it
paired
particularly
well
with
a
mild
orange
cheddar
pick
up
a
couple
of
bottles
if
you
can
and
be
sure
to
share
with
a
friend
deep
amber
color
topped
with
a
thick
longlasting
tan
head
roasted
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
fruits
taste
is
burned
blackened
roasted
malts
and
a
little
sweet
cherry
flavor
then
on
to
a
candylike
tangy
finish
fullbodied
and
rich
a
very
solid
brew
the
flagship
brew
from
this
famous
brewery
gorgeous
deep
mahogany
color
which
becomes
cloudy
when
the
bottle
is
fully
decanted
into
my
glass
tan
head
with
orange
highlights
thin
tiny
bubbles
good
lacing
head
quickly
reduced
itself
to
a
skim
sweet
malt
candied
fruits
and
fresh
bread
in
the
aroma
so
smooth
complex
flavors
of
toffee
floral
hops
alcohol
notes
and
a
long
finish
that
ends
on
a
caramel
note
truly
a
layered
beer
great
balance
mediumlight
carbonation
more
alc
as
it
warms
and
toasted
malts
as
it
approaches
room
temp
impressive
example
of
the
belgian
style
being
made
by
an
american
company
and
a
gratifying
experience
not
the
best
bottle
of
ommegang
i
have
enjoyed
so
far
the
best
has
come
from
corks
in
mansfield
but
still
quite
tasty
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
us
d
ok
in
small
doses
but
the
sweetness
would
make
it
hard
for
me
to
drink
much
of
this
a
nice
beer
to
sample
but
if
this
is
a
typical
example
of
a
dubbel
i
think
ill
rate
it
as
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
drinkability
is
moderate
good
flavors
make
for
easy
drinking
the
high
carbonation
really
ruins
it
for
me
though
drinkability
overall
it
is
a
gteat
beer
pours
a
cloudy
chocolate
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
smells
of
licoriche
and
honey
very
aromatic
taste
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
rasins
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
belgian
yeast
strain
flavor
as
well
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
carbonation
levels
medium
an
easy
drinking
dubbel
especially
for
the
abv
that
tastes
great
d
ill
finish
the
bomber
but
thats
only
because
its
there
drinkability
another
winner
from
ommegang
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
brewery
a
beautiful
affordable
dubbel
d
a
fantastic
dubbel
w
a
great
repeated
drink
score
this
is
big
8
5
and
smooth
which
is
a
great
combo
cant
go
wrong
w
an
ommegang
dubbel
like
a
festival
for
your
taste
buds
d
high
abv
dings
the
drinkability
a
little
bit
i
can
see
the
slight
harshness
catching
up
to
me
over
time
good
alternative
to
expensive
imported
belgians
but
lacks
some
characteristics
of
really
good
belgian
beers
i
will
buy
this
again
for
sure
d
pretty
good
i
hear
it
is
awesome
with
some
age
on
it
so
i
am
going
to
have
to
lay
some
down
good
beer
goes
good
with
pork
and
mashed
potatoes
definately
something
ill
try
again
mild
complexity
is
the
best
way
that
i
can
try
to
sum
up
this
bountiful
brew
pours
a
deep
rich
burgandy
color
with
more
than
ample
head
that
never
leaves
there
is
considerable
amounts
of
lacing
rounding
out
a
wonderful
appearance
the
aroma
is
a
bouquet
of
dark
fruits
and
spices
plums
raisins
figs
perhaps
swirled
around
some
cinnamon
and
cloves
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thinner
than
i
was
expecting
but
adequate
the
flavor
is
a
toned
down
version
of
the
aroma
lots
of
intricate
flavors
come
together
to
form
a
very
appealing
taste
finish
is
smooth
with
a
slight
alcohol
warming
nicely
done
d
a
damn
fine
american
example
of
a
belgian
style
ale
and
another
great
offering
from
ommegang
drinkability
nice
balanced
beer
would
purchase
it
again
it
does
come
in
big
and
small
bottles
a
great
introduction
to
the
abbey
style
highly
drinkable
with
nice
carbonation
light
on
the
bitterness
mouthfeeldrinkability
pretty
sticky
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
carbonation
is
well
balanced
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
good
because
i
like
this
style
but
i
would
say
it
is
not
my
favorite
i
think
it
lacks
sweetness
certainly
not
bad
and
definitely
worth
a
try
its
a
good
american
redition
of
a
belgian
dubbel
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
enjoyed
this
beer
nonetheless
not
as
heavy
or
as
sweet
as
other
dubbels
ive
tried
i
dont
go
crazy
for
the
style
but
this
was
nicely
done
very
solid
id
have
this
again
d
very
tasty
and
rich
in
the
fruit
and
yeast
a
brew
that
i
cuold
drink
all
day
in
moderation
though
this
could
come
up
in
and
bite
you
in
the
ass
after
4
or
5
a
nice
beer
to
play
poker
with
what
a
well
executed
brew
ommegang
sets
a
great
industry
standard
and
this
flagship
brew
really
bears
the
torch
d
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
the
8
5
abv
is
surprising
i
just
dont
get
a
sense
of
any
significant
alcohol
content
very
well
disguised
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
heavy
for
my
preference
overall
pretty
damn
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
darker
heavier
this
ale
was
a
meal
unto
itself
the
750
l
was
perhaps
a
little
too
much
for
me
to
drink
practically
on
my
own
a
delicious
meal
however
and
one
id
be
glad
to
have
again
these
two
beers
will
likely
become
staples
of
my
refrigerator
fullbodied
with
an
edible
biscuity
character
tastes
delicious
and
feels
nutritious
a
wonderful
american
version
of
a
belgian
dubbel
pick
this
up
if
you
enjoy
any
of
the
trapist
dubbels
i
love
this
with
some
dutch
blue
cheese
on
whole
grain
crackers
and
red
apples
poured
a
deep
orangebrown
into
the
glass
and
produced
a
good
looking
orange
tinted
head
that
hung
around
several
minutes
with
each
sip
a
tremendous
amount
of
lacing
followed
the
beer
it
smeled
wonderfully
light
like
a
subtle
sweet
maltiness
that
was
balanced
just
right
upon
first
taste
i
knew
i
wanted
more
a
very
well
balanced
slightly
sweet
perfect
example
of
the
belgian
abbey
style
mouthfeel
was
light
like
the
aroma
and
left
a
bittersweet
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
drinability
i
would
give
this
one
high
marks
great
to
share
with
a
friend
if
you
can
sacrifice
half
a
bottle
dark
coppermaroon
cloudy
and
opaque
with
a
generous
head
that
had
excellent
retention
and
nice
lacing
malts
and
dark
fruits
evident
on
the
nose
as
well
as
some
brown
sugar
flavors
of
dark
fruits
figs
and
cherries
some
cloves
and
spices
and
caramelized
sugar
very
soft
on
the
palate
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
dry
finish
drinkability
im
not
going
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
i
will
thoroughly
enjoy
every
sip
very
challenging
id
like
to
use
this
for
a
reduction
sauce
with
roasted
lamb
chops
and
of
course
pour
a
glass
alongside
d
good
drinkability
drinkability
is
what
it
is
i
felt
satisfied
but
did
not
want
another
overall
a
delicious
malty
treat
with
a
kick
milky
creamy
feel
a
bitter
bite
on
the
way
down
a
real
slowsipper
fizzy
and
bubbly
toward
the
end
this
is
a
very
strong
beverage
thick
and
chewy
sweeter
than
expected
quite
challenging
very
silky
mouthfeel
and
the
alcohol
burn
is
very
noticeable
i
would
definitely
have
another
for
such
a
sweet
and
alcoholic
beer
it
is
relatively
smooth
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
d
very
drinkable
however
the
abv
and
complexity
do
limit
the
sessionability
a
little
you
can
not
quaff
this
one
like
their
hennepin
but
sipping
and
enjoying
you
can
do
an
excellently
constructed
brew
and
highly
recommended
ommegang
is
consistently
putting
out
high
quality
beer
overall
came
in
a
nice
big
bottle
with
a
cork
like
its
cousin
the
three
philosophers
this
beer
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
goes
nicely
with
a
lamb
chop
or
filet
mignon
will
buy
again
when
they
were
fresh
from
the
fridge
i
preferred
the
belgian
it
was
more
wellrounded
and
the
fruity
esters
in
the
american
were
pretty
intense
but
as
they
warmed
to
room
temperature
i
preferred
the
american
when
the
alcohol
spiciness
in
the
belgian
really
came
forward
this
was
a
great
version
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
kudos
to
the
fine
brewers
at
ommegang
who
really
know
how
to
make
a
great
belgian
style
ale
good
american
interpretation
of
the
vaunted
dubbel
style
highly
recommended
if
youve
not
tried
it
the
price
alone
makes
it
worth
your
while
of
course
not
an
everyday
type
beer
more
like
once
a
month
with
some
beef
stew
or
chocolate
drinkability
here
is
good
ive
got
3
more
and
i
plan
to
cellar
2
and
drink
the
other
d
a
very
good
dubbel
with
a
few
little
suprises
here
and
there
nothing
that
i
can
easily
put
my
finger
on
but
the
subtlety
has
me
stocking
my
cellar
with
it
pours
a
deep
redbrown
with
a
finger
head
that
shrinks
to
a
ring
in
a
few
minutes
love
the
smell
sweet
toffee
caramel
and
raisins
the
taste
starts
where
the
nose
began
with
more
raisins
dates
and
overripe
plum
flavors
then
it
balances
out
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
that
reveals
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
warming
to
leave
with
you
a
really
solid
beer
that
stands
up
with
some
of
the
belgian
dubbels
ive
tried
d
good
but
it
does
seem
to
fall
short
of
the
belgians
id
like
to
do
a
blind
taste
test
one
day
to
see
the
american
belgians
are
certainly
getting
closer
d
enjoyable
brew
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
belgianstyle
brews
wouldnt
wanna
session
this
one
but
definitely
nice
when
the
time
is
right
sampled
on
tap
at
terrapin
restaurant
bistro
in
rhinebeck
ny
served
in
a
proper
ommegang
chalice
bar
stocks
a
good
selection
of
ny
beers
on
tap
and
bartender
is
quite
knowledgeable
beer
was
capped
nicely
by
a
light
tantoffee
toned
head
that
left
very
appealing
lacing
the
beer
displays
a
lovely
reddishamber
hued
tone
the
nose
is
fantastice
dried
fruits
some
belgian
yeasts
spicy
black
pepperclove
like
touch
of
malty
sweetness
in
there
to
balance
the
aroma
out
flavor
is
awesome
as
well
dried
fruits
agains
clovesmalts
yeasty
slightly
sweet
on
the
taste
but
cut
perfectly
by
a
great
dryish
finish
of
alcohol
and
spice
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
creamy
yet
biting
enough
to
keep
the
drinker
constantly
reaching
for
another
sip
yet
another
outstanding
brew
from
ommegang
d
its
a
good
beer
but
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
i
think
it
had
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
would
drink
it
again
will
try
it
in
the
bigger
corked
bottle
its
all
a
matter
of
personal
preference
but
if
im
having
a
dubbel
id
prefer
a
chimay
premiere
md
smooth
and
creamy
very
drinkable
dubbel
as
good
as
many
of
the
belgian
belgians
i
have
had
i
need
to
pick
up
more
of
this
delicious
notes
pour
this
in
the
right
glassif
you
dont
it
will
be
a
different
experience
this
beer
is
easy
to
find
and
a
good
reputation
overall
from
ommegang
in
addition
i
have
to
say
that
the
drinkability
could
be
better
as
the
alcohol
was
not
well
masked
md
lots
of
carbonation
and
the
spices
give
it
quite
the
kick
this
made
it
not
as
smooth
as
i
would
have
liked
poured
from
the
bottle
it
is
a
deep
reddishbrown
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
it
smells
very
sweet
with
some
fruity
scents
and
also
brown
sugar
tastes
fruity
and
spicey
with
a
little
caramel
brown
sugar
and
malt
it
was
pretty
smooth
going
down
a
tad
bit
of
carbonation
before
i
knew
it
the
entire
bottle
was
gone
and
i
was
ready
for
more
this
was
priced
very
reasonably
for
what
it
is
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
an
excellent
abbey
ale
from
an
outstanding
brewery
it
pours
a
dark
burgundy
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
body
is
dark
and
hazy
full
of
wonderful
flavor
and
aromas
the
aroma
is
filled
with
caramel
malts
fruit
and
spice
as
well
as
an
alcohol
kick
in
the
nose
the
palate
is
full
and
the
alcohol
has
a
nice
warming
quality
to
it
favors
of
sweet
caramel
dried
dark
cherries
prune
and
yeast
dance
on
the
tongue
these
favors
mingle
for
a
time
and
finish
slowly
ommegang
is
grate
as
it
is
and
could
be
even
better
with
cellaring
i
also
have
used
this
as
the
brew
in
making
beer
and
gouda
soup
and
it
worked
amazing
the
flavors
really
stood
out
in
the
soup
even
with
the
strength
of
the
smoked
cheese
the
boldness
of
this
could
still
be
tasted
yum
d
ok
overall
but
a
little
too
alcoholic
which
i
feel
takes
away
a
little
bit
from
the
beer
overall
i
feel
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
alcohlic
tastes
can
be
a
little
biting
which
takes
away
from
the
drinking
experience
overall
this
is
both
a
good
bargain
and
a
good
find
pour
carefully
otherwise
youll
wind
up
with
a
giant
head
and
very
little
liquid
the
head
itself
lasts
a
long
time
and
is
wonderful
to
slurp
color
is
a
shimmery
brownishred
nose
is
quite
yeasty
but
still
pleasant
flavors
are
very
fruity
and
summery
and
a
bit
bready
but
this
is
good
to
drink
yearround
especially
with
spicy
food
bonus
the
bottle
is
tall
heavy
and
thickwalled
and
comes
with
a
cork
rather
than
a
cap
nice
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
red
like
polished
wood
creamy
one
inch
thick
head
light
browntan
color
decent
head
retention
with
some
lacing
smells
of
dark
fruit
like
cherries
and
other
berries
put
on
top
of
bread
very
interesting
on
the
nose
theres
also
something
else
coming
thru
that
i
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
drinks
wonderfully
well
this
is
one
malty
brew
with
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
finish
lasts
pretty
well
really
enjoying
it
mediumlight
to
medium
body
with
good
dose
of
carbonation
that
you
can
really
feel
when
you
swallow
man
i
wish
i
had
some
cheese
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
pretty
thin
carbonation
is
high
but
not
offensive
relative
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
abv
is
a
tad
bit
high
at
8
5
which
hinders
drinkability
just
a
bit
no
way
id
tackle
more
than
one
750
in
a
sitting
it
lacks
characteristics
strong
enough
to
warrant
more
than
that
overall
its
a
very
solid
beer
certainly
one
ill
have
again
overall
well
worth
it
it
costs
significantly
less
than
the
actual
belgian
beers
and
does
a
good
job
representing
the
style
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
dark
red
color
with
a
dense
tan
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
with
cherry
and
prune
flavor
is
much
the
same
kind
of
like
three
philosophers
junior
cherry
and
dark
fruits
make
up
the
esters
while
yeast
creates
a
doughy
underpinning
malt
is
sweet
and
chewy
dry
finish
to
a
rich
palate
average
drinkability
this
belgian
dubbelstyle
beer
poured
a
dark
crimson
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
earthy
malt
mixed
with
slight
floral
hops
it
tasted
like
chalky
dark
chocolate
and
bitter
floral
hops
mixed
with
some
wild
yeast
it
was
watery
with
surprisingly
no
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
chocolate
aftertaste
overall
this
didnt
have
too
bad
of
a
belgian
taste
but
it
wasnt
very
clean
either
i
have
paid
12
a
bottle
for
lesser
beers
truely
a
great
one
the
very
first
sip
of
this
americanmade
beer
reminded
me
of
drinking
dubbels
at
brussels
delirium
cafe
this
beer
is
a
very
cloudy
amber
color
it
pours
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
layer
in
about
8
minutes
its
smell
does
not
jump
out
of
the
glass
and
is
a
bit
too
faint
for
getting
a
good
idea
of
what
to
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
good
the
carbonation
leaves
the
liquid
midsip
and
makes
for
a
filling
beer
tastes
offers
bits
of
yeast
dark
chocolate
caramel
dull
tones
of
honey
and
is
overall
on
the
bitter
side
but
its
a
delicious
bitter
side
the
true
belgianstyle
dubbel
marking
on
the
bottle
is
no
lie
but
honestly
its
deep
rich
honest
amber
color
and
its
sublime
honey
taste
truly
dealt
the
beauty
of
its
taste
i
say
most
americans
would
say
she
failed
but
i
say
hell
why
not
her
honey
tongue
lapped
at
my
wanton
organ
with
a
lust
that
is
unparalleled
with
the
rest
of
the
true
belgians
and
the
monks
must
be
in
upheaval
over
this
true
the
ommegang
lacks
the
veracity
and
the
luster
that
the
others
boast
but
its
the
style
were
interested
in
right
its
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
attributing
the
greatness
to
their
prowess
right
after
all
they
have
accomplished
this
feat
they
are
the
ones
we
are
after
well
after
all
as
they
do
what
we
cannot
do
they
have
managed
to
brew
a
perfunctory
brew
d
the
alcohol
and
malt
tastes
are
too
strong
the
aroma
is
a
little
harsh
and
unfinished
smells
like
wort
way
too
filling
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
new
belgians
version
is
much
better
imho
d
by
the
end
the
slightly
sour
finish
prevents
me
from
rating
this
higher
d
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
ive
heard
good
things
about
the
brewery
perhaps
this
just
wasnt
my
bag
ill
take
the
advice
of
others
and
give
the
rest
of
the
lineup
a
shot
however
as
for
this
one
i
suppose
its
worth
a
try
if
its
not
out
of
your
way
although
a
faintly
slick
mouthfeel
competes
with
the
otherwise
fullbodied
richness
of
the
brew
its
still
nice
to
see
an
american
brewer
doing
belgians
so
well
d
i
dont
think
ill
be
enjoying
the
rest
of
my
4
pack
of
these
this
was
a
task
just
to
finish
this
is
not
ogs
best
go
for
the
3
philosophers
instead
poured
a
deep
red
color
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
hung
around
and
left
some
heavy
lacing
smelled
of
sweet
fruits
with
a
tartness
on
the
nose
tasted
very
thin
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
it
got
fruitier
and
more
tart
this
is
a
good
staple
belgianstyle
ale
that
i
will
come
back
to
again
and
again
on
a
second
sampling
this
beer
seems
much
more
bitter
to
me
i
am
also
overwhelmingly
reminded
of
wine
the
winelike
character
really
seems
to
be
coming
through
this
time
too
cold
of
a
temperature
really
did
this
beer
an
injustice
when
it
reached
an
ideal
temp
it
had
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
without
being
too
heavy
very
drinkable
will
enjoy
again
poured
an
attractive
dark
burgundy
color
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
hung
around
a
while
aroma
is
quite
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
with
the
taste
of
dark
fruits
and
a
nice
dry
finish
nice
beer
that
i
would
definitely
explore
again
had
a
very
nutty
malty
flavor
that
sort
of
overwhelmed
the
flavors
of
the
esters
that
you
find
in
most
belgian
beers
the
esters
come
through
as
it
warms
giving
it
a
very
sweet
taste
throughout
has
nice
depth
of
flavor
but
the
sweetness
needs
more
hops
keeps
this
from
going
to
the
next
level
md
mouthfeel
is
awesome
utilizing
good
medium
body
and
carbonation
that
makes
the
whole
experience
creamy
and
smooth
the
whole
package
makes
for
very
good
drinkability
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
overall
a
fine
dubbel
especially
given
the
price
not
quite
great
but
certainly
up
to
par
and
at
the
price
you
can
stock
up
on
em
fine
job
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
great
that
there
are
belgium
style
beers
this
good
coming
out
of
the
u
s
final
thought
this
is
an
amazing
accomplishment
for
a
brewery
in
america
to
serve
these
belgians
at
still
an
affordable
price
thumbs
way
up
i
made
the
mistake
of
having
this
be
the
second
beer
i
drank
tonight
at
750
ml
it
was
very
hard
to
finish
in
one
sitting
but
i
managed
all
in
all
for
being
an
american
interpetation
of
an
belgian
abbey
its
a
fantastic
beer
if
you
like
belgians
you
will
love
it
and
its
very
affordable
i
paid
5
75
at
a
bar
for
750
ml
you
cant
beat
that
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
brewed
right
here
in
the
states
nice
a
great
dubbel
im
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
beers
and
ommegang
i
really
love
the
idea
american
brewery
devoted
to
belgian
style
beers
kind
of
like
the
american
version
of
unibroue
very
affordable
i
think
i
paid
56
i
would
like
to
see
ommegang
produce
a
tripel
in
the
future
notes
my
first
test
of
an
ommegang
brew
as
well
as
a
first
test
of
a
dubbel
and
i
have
to
say
i
am
quite
impressed
despite
being
more
of
a
malty
brew
i
would
go
out
again
and
buy
this
one
in
a
heartbeat
ommegang
has
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
had
been
hearing
definitely
recommended
this
is
a
fine
dubbel
clean
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
medium
body
deep
ruby
red
color
leads
into
a
light
apple
flavor
and
yeasty
fruity
scent
major
lacing
on
the
sides
of
a
large
red
wine
gobblet
really
even
flavors
that
arent
as
complex
as
other
belgian
style
beers
but
hold
up
on
their
own
easily
does
nicely
as
an
after
dinner
beer
didnt
take
me
long
to
finish
this
one
only
bought
a
12oz
single
drinkability
is
dangerous
considering
the
abv
proceed
with
caution
the
ommegang
poured
into
my
tasting
snifter
with
a
thick
head
that
immediately
disappeared
the
smell
was
overwhelmingly
sweet
with
a
deep
fruity
aroma
it
is
very
reminiscent
of
barleywine
style
ale
it
was
full
of
the
sweet
smell
dark
dried
fruit
the
color
was
a
deep
burgundy
the
taste
was
immensely
sweet
with
a
sour
finish
and
malty
chocolate
notes
im
assuming
that
the
fizz
at
the
end
is
due
to
some
type
of
champagne
yeast
regardless
it
is
a
truly
wonderful
beer
the
more
that
i
get
to
know
the
ommegang
beers
the
more
i
like
them
i
will
definitely
have
to
plan
a
trip
to
cooperstown
n
y
in
the
near
future
d
hard
to
put
down
the
glass
great
dessert
beer
very
drinkable
but
more
this
style
is
more
of
something
i
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
rather
than
constantly
drink
d
very
enjoyable
this
ia
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
taste
it
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
to
brown
color
head
is
1
finger
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
very
fruity
with
dark
malts
taste
has
a
lot
of
dark
malts
and
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
not
as
heavy
as
i
was
expecting
drinkability
is
not
as
much
as
sum
due
to
to
the
heaviness
and
the
sweetness
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
plus
tannish
creamy
head
which
leaves
some
really
nice
sticky
lacing
and
small
islands
the
nose
is
malty
slight
yeast
prunes
figs
raisins
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
at
first
some
nice
malts
dark
fruit
and
caramel
medium
body
a
well
roundedcomplex
brew
very
drinkable
this
is
my
second
ommegang
brew
and
its
delicious
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
better
than
some
of
the
dubbels
ive
had
that
are
actually
from
belgium
the
chaps
up
there
in
cooperstown
certainly
got
it
right
i
have
one
more
bottle
left
that
is
going
into
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
hopefully
it
gets
even
better
with
a
little
age
drinkability
im
sure
some
of
these
scores
are
brought
down
to
this
brew
not
meeting
my
high
expectations
this
really
wasnt
a
bad
brew
but
when
you
go
in
expecting
a
homerun
a
ground
rule
double
just
wont
do
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
tried
from
the
ommegang
brewery
and
i
must
say
im
impressed
a
very
good
bsa
with
plenty
of
malt
in
it
considering
the
low
price
this
is
a
beer
ill
gladly
come
back
to
poured

mildly
rich

a
relatively
short

presence
of
alcohol
is
known
but
not
overbearing
palate
is
sweet
and
rich
with
some
toastiness
but
is
tempered
by
slight
tanginess
carbontation
is
a
little
overpowering
silky
and
creamy

good
beer
to
have
on
a
quiet
night
with
a
book
in
front
of
the
fireplace
poured
into
a
snifter
the
abbey

a
beautiful
rich

a

drops
slowly

much

the
palate
goes
crazy

is
outstanding
high
carbonation
and
complex

make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
a
very
soothing
beer
with
a
great
complexity
of
dried
fruit
malting
and
spicing
and
drinks
like
a
dream
at
8
5abv
d
i
could
only
drink
a
couple
of
these
its
a
very
rich
brew
but
it
comes
in
a
4
pack
for
a
reason
great
pick
up
ill
definitely
try
this
again
overall
hell
yes
age
this
one
d
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
treat
certainly
a
one
to
be
enjoyed
by
it
self
it
drinks
very
nicely
if
youre
a
lover
of
belgian
style
ales
the
8
5
abv
does
its
thing
and
does
it
well
i
would
not
want
any
more
than
two
if
that
of
these
in
a
sitting
as
in
most
cases
this
is
certainly
not
a
detriment
of
character
just
an
acknowledgment
of
its
power
i
will
definitely
file
this
one
under
the
keeper
category
and
revisit
often
cheers
to
ommegang
for
such
a
masterpiece
pours
a
muddy
brown
reddish
color
with
a
good
beige
head
smell
is
somewhat
fruity
yet
rich
and
creamy
with
a
hint
of
the
clovey
hefeweizen
yeast
smell
taste
is
very
unique
and
somewhat
highly
carbonated
some
spiced
sweetness
at
1st
along
with
some
roasted
slightly
bitter
tastes
and
some
flat
licorice
like
taste
in
the
finish
after
drinking
half
of
it
i
still
hardly
know
what
to
think
after
it
warmed
a
bit
i
like
it
less
and
am
not
crazy
about
finishing
it
definitely
drinkable
but
not
something
i
particularly
care
for
this
is
obviously
liked
by
many
but
it
is
not
my
style
of
beer
cheaper
than
the
imports
but
similar
in
quality
with
some
of
its
own
unique
character
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
ill
stick
with
chimay
dthis
is
a
very
rich
tasting
beeri
would
not
call
it
session
beer
but
it
is
a
nice
sipper
though
this
beer
is
not
the
style
i
typically
like
it
is
a
fine
beer
a
bit
tarter
than
i
expected
has
strong
citrus
taste
and
is
carbonated
which
leaves
a
bubbly
feel
in
your
mouth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
those
who
dont
think
they
like
beer
as
it
is
not
very
hoppy
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
didnt
care
as
much
for
it
as
ommegangs
other
beers
i
e
rare
vos
or
hennepin
it
was
a
little
tart
for
my
taste
still
a
wellproduced
beer
pours
an
absolutely
beautiful
ruby
red
color
with
a
big
orange
head
it
laces
a
bit
more
than
most
belgians
ive
had
smell
is
good
fruity
aroma
with
lots
of
yeast
scents
too
taste
is
heavenly
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
that
was
a
stretch
from
bmc
i
had
it
about
3
years
ago
and
i
remember
thinking
how
could
anyone
drink
this
but
after
a
few
hundred
craft
brews
this
is
one
i
wanted
to
review
anyway
back
to
the
review
it
has
a
wonderful
alcohol
warmness
to
it
as
well
as
a
fruity
mixture
like
many
belgians
have
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
full
drinkability
is
a
little
hampered
to
do
its
high
abv
exceptional
belgian
imho
d
the
label
is
correct
when
it
says
this
is
a
beer
for
celebration
just
like
chimay
its
way
too
complex
and
would
be
a
shame
to
just
crush
64oz
of
this
stuff
that
being
said
it
was
no
problem
at
all
takin
this
bottle
to
the
capital
update
had
a
3
year
old
bottle
probably
held
on
to
it
a
little
bit
to
long
but
the
fruit
really
comes
out
nicely
with
tons
of
apples
the
malt
is
just
great
a
touch
of
oxidization
is
creeping
in
but
not
enough
to
detract
drinkability
for
a
high
abv
the
750ml
bottle
went
down
very
easy
definitely
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
for
a
whole
night
i
liked
ommegangs
witte
beer
but
this
one
right
here
proved
above
and
beyond
that
this
a
really
great
brewery
as
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
this
is
an
excellent
rendition
of
the
style
from
a
12oz
bottle
pours
a
rubyred
mahogany
prune
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
lingered
for
a
bit
smell
was
full
of
figs
prunes
and
dark
fruit
taste
complemented
the
aroma
strong
sweet
thick
creamy
rich
flavor
similar
to
a
doppelbock
wonderful
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
palate
very
fullbodied
and
malty
awesome
brew
hard
to
detect
the
8
5
abv
masked
by
awesome
combination
of
flavors
definitely
recommended
popped
open
a
3l
bottle
at
midnight
to
ring
in
the
new
year
it
poured
a
nice
dark
red
amber
color
with
a
tall
thick
head
that
came
stuck
around
for
a
very
long
time
it
had
an
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
some
fruity
flavoring
it
tasted
excellent
especially
for
this
kind
of
beer
it
had
a
very
sweet
malty
taste
with
hints
of
fruits
cherries
and
grapes
mostly
and
a
very
clean
finish
it
had
a
really
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
it
was
very
drinkable
which
is
good
because
i
had
3l
of
it
to
drink
of
which
i
had
more
than
a
few
definately
worth
a
try
if
you
like
belgian
beers
its
great
to
see
an
american
brewery
consistently
make
great
belgianstyle
beers
a
great
offering
from
brewery
ommegang
d
at
8
5
abv
this
isnt
a
session
beer
its
very
good
though
i
want
another
one
but
i
shouldnt
have
it
tastes
of
dark
fruits
a
little
tart
but
sweet
as
well
spices
and
caramel
this
brew
pours
to
a
brown
color
with
some
nice
amber
highlights
a
rust
like
color
is
how
i
would
explain
it
the
head
is
quite
foamy
color
is
tan
with
some
reddish
highlights
some
lacing
which
could
be
due
to
the
glass
as
i
would
expect
some
more
the
aromas
come
across
as
candy
slightly
burnt
brown
sugar
toffee
fruit
maybe
plum
andor
raisin
and
a
slight
alcohol
smell
which
comes
out
more
as
the
brew
warms
up
the
taste
is
very
good
malt
flavors
are
real
clear
sweet
flavor
also
there
is
a
fruit
like
flavor
hiding
in
there
that
seems
to
come
out
as
the
brew
warms
which
ties
it
self
to
a
more
pronounced
alcohol
flavor
while
more
of
a
sipping
brew
this
seems
to
be
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
scary
with
the
high
level
of
alcohol
definitely
a
very
good
brew
this
is
my
first
ommegang
beer
and
from
what
i
understand
they
do
excellent
belgian
style
beers
this
one
is
no
exception
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
this
is
a
great
sipper
that
i
would
gladly
sip
from
again
definitely
a
great
pick
notes
this
was
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
got
this
beer
to
celebrate
the
end
of
the
semester
with
and
it
just
didnt
have
that
belgian
flair
to
it
that
made
my
nose
and
my
taste
buds
go
wow
this
has
a
lot
of
freakin
flavor
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
hennepin
though
since
people
seem
to
be
more
impressed
with
that
beer
ive
heard
good
things
about
this
brewery
i
just
hope
that
theyre
true
this
is
a
decent
american
version
of
a
belgium
strong
aledubble
not
my
favorite
so
far
but
i
will
revisit
this
beer
soon
still
i
would
recommend
it
d
a
very
nice
beer
to
have
around
a
very
nice
drinkable
belgian
strong
ale
from
ommegang
this
is
a
meal
in
a
bottle
so
drinkability
is
based
on
the
fact
that
this
brew
would
be
enjoyed
slowly
over
the
course
of
an
evening
youre
not
going
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
most
likely
but
very
drinkable
on
its
own
right
update

a
ba
buddy
and
i
did
a
sidebyside
comparison
of
the
belgium
brewed
v
the
new
york
brewed
versions
of
this
beer
my
original
review
was
of
the
belgium
version
our
conclusion
is
that
the
belgium
version
had
a
darker
body
more
complex
flavors
and
creamer
mouth
feel
both
are
superior
brews
but
the
belgium
version
is
more
like
a
bdsa
and
the
new
york
version
more
of
a
dubble
d
this
is
a
little
on
the
rich
side
but
its
wonderfully
complex
it
is
nice
and
creamy
on
the
palate
and
not
sticky
it
is
hard
to
believe
this
wasnt
brewed
in
belgium
this
is
a
beer
which
i
have
found
the
aroma
profile
to
be
superior
when
younger
and
then
the
flavor
profile
more
appealing
with
age
this
particular
bottle
is
fairly
young
no
more
than
3
to
6
months
of
age
the
flavor
is
more
fruity
with
a
soft
but
impacting
mouthfeel
for
a
big
abbey
ale
this
drinks
very
smooth
the
alcohol
sits
well
under
the
malt
and
flavor
profile
serving
to
accent
the
key
notes
this
beer
pours
into
my
goblet
with
a
dark
amber
body
and
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
stays
nicely
leaving
some
leave
the
smell
is
full
of
sweet
caramelized
malts
and
ommegangs
proprietary
yeast
the
taste
is
up
front
with
sweet
caramelized
malts
and
the
same
yeastiness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
and
full
quite
nice
overall
a
great
beer
all
said
a
fantastic
americanbelgian
probably
one
of
the
five
or
six
best
americanbrewed
belgianinspired
ales
the
complexity
of
a
really
good
quad
the
smoothness
of
a
really
good
stout
the
craftsmanship
of
a
really
good
belgian
and
its
under
5
dollars
for
a
750
dollar
for
dollar
pound
for
pound
this
is
near
the
top
of
any
list
of
great
american
beers
absolutely
fantastic

ommegang
does
a
great
brewery
tour
if
you
are
in
cooperstown
ive
always
wanted
to
try
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
dark
garnet
color
w
a
fluffy
tan
head
which
dissapates
quickly
leaving
a
fine
lacing
throughout
a
rich

w
some
fruity
spiciness
bannana
w
coriander
perhaps
a
rich
tangy
complex
caramely
malt
flavor
at
first
then
blending
w
a
warm
alcoholic
fruitiness
simalar
to
the
aroma
to
finish
crisply
a
med
body
w
alot
of
carbonation
lingers
on
the
palate
enabling
one
to
savor
the
flavors
this
is
an
awesome
drinking
beer
im
glad
ive
got
three
more
to
go
i
cannot
say
enough
positive
about
this
beer
which
may
well
be
my
favorite
the
mona
lisa
of
belgian
strong
dark
ales
in
the
us
five
stars
hands
down
a
fav
amongst
this
style
flavors
of
caramel
sweet
malt
dark
fruits
and
yet
it
finishes
dry
asking
for
more
not
a
st
bernardus
but
close
a
prime
example
of
american
made
belgian
strong
drinkability
was
moderate
to
good
i
think
being
a
higher
abv
beer
i
think
the
beer
could
get
a
little
too
cloying
if
too
much
is
consumed
over
a
night
one
bottle
was
enough
for
me
d
pleasant
things
overall
easily
drinkable
and
definitely
worth
the
value
at
6
for
a
750ml
will
do
again
poured
from
bottle
into
a
glass
while
sitting
out
front
handing
out
candy
to
trick
or
treaters
lots
of
head
and
it
lasted
a
while
too
nice
looking
beer
smelled
fruity
malty
and
sweet
taste
was
smooth
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
very
enjoyable
opened
with
a
pop
and
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
smell
of
malt
and
dark
fruit
raisins
figs
plum
hits
the
nose
poured
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
the
color
of
mahogany
decent
head
retention
and
thin
lacing
adherence
during
the
tasting
subtle
and
consistent
carbonation
provides
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
astringence
with
flavors
of
malt
yeast
and
dark
fruit
pleasantly
drinkable
but
better
for
savoring
than
quick
consumption
enjoyable
but
not
my
favorite
from
ommegang
drinkablity
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
i
could
easily
see
my
self
kicking
back
with
2
or
3
of
these
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
central
market
while
traveling
in
fort
worth
tx
drank
from
a
wine
glass
as
i
didnt
have
a
chalice
handy
i
poured
the
yeast
right
in
as
i
like
belgian
style
beers
better
that
way
tastes
like
sugar
candy
but
not
overly
sweet
it
maintains
a
very
good
balance
the
alcohol
is
fairly
prominent
but
not
enough
to
knock
you
on
your
ass
this
beer
was
pretty
damn
good
i
may
have
to
pick
up
my
own
bottle
just
to
sample
it
further
ommegang
does
a
smashing
job
making
belgian
brews
in
america
and
this
is
a
good
example
d
this
is
an
excellent
and
complex
brew
by
ommegang
it
has
sour
sweet
smooth
and
spicy
characteristics
that
blend
together
very
well
the
8
5
is
not
hidden
hereand
my
12
oz
bottle
was
plenty
for
one
sitting
i
will
have
this
one
againas
ommegang
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
still
have
a
bomber
3
philosophers
left
in
my
fridge
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
it
then
i
shall
move
on
to
chocolate
indulgence
its
good
i
never
really
had
a
bad
ommegang
but
ill
opt
for
a
rare
vos
or
a
three
philosophers
anytime
the
problem
is
the
more
i
taste
the
less
i
like
it
there
is
a
medicinal
and
copper
metallic
flavor
that
comes
forward
as
the
beer
warms
stange
beer
to
me
i
taste
different
flavors
with
each
sip
but
i
dont
care
for
the
flavors
that
are
coming
to
the
forefront
as
when
i
tasted
it
at
first
good
elements
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
a
steal
though
at
6
bucks
one
more
note
on
this
beer
which
i
liked
when
the
bottle
was
empty
there
was
a
good
amount
of
yeast
sediment
left
around
the
bottom
ring
of
the
bottle
this
is
something
you
see
often
in
homebrews
but
little
in
commercial
beers
since
they
are
so
often
filtered
not
necessarily
important
overall
but
it
gives
the
beer
more
of
that
homemade
small
batch
type
of
feeling
d
though
the
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
this
beer
commands
you
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
slowly
one
caution
dont
eat
with
walnuts
something
about
walnuts
ommegang
gave
me
the
sensation
in
the
back
of
my
throat
of
having
just
done
a
shot
excellent
take
on
a
belgian
this
seemed
like
an
exceptional
deal
at

50

and
i
liked
hennepin
so
here
i
am
i
poured
this
into
a
snifter
but
i
bet
a
wine
glass
would
have
worked
as
well
the
color
is
the
darkest
red
i
have
ever
seen
but
not
quite
brown
the
head
is
a
craggy
rocky
fortress
of
creamcolored
bubbles
the
smells
are
like
squeezed
grapes
wine
alcohol
raisins
and
i
find
myself
sniffing
away
as
i
sip
the
flavor
is
strong
some
raisins
long
aftertaste
of
licorice
and
a
slight
tinge
of
alcohol
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
really
smooth
but
the
beer
does
coat
your
mouth
thoroughly
the
alcohol
starts
rearing
its
beautiful
head
towards
the
end
of
the
first
glass
and
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
feel
like
dying
i
drank
this
while
listening

just

the

not

else
the
taste
is
very

its
very

with
some
cork
tastes
its
like
tasting
a
piece
of

or
sucking
on
some
cardboard
mouthfeel
isnt
horrible
not
so
bad
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
the
taste
you
get
in
your
mouth
after
puking
overall
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
try
this
ever
again
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
did
not
enjoy
this
i
feel
almost
bad
about
dragging
down
the
average
but
im
almost
positive
it
wasnt
skunked
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
beer
being
outofdate
the
750
ml
bottle
poured
out
almost
like
wine
with
a
ridiculously
frothy
head
that
retained
for
several
minutes
the
smell
was
of
fruity
and
sweet
wine
without
the
blatant
alcohol
the
taste
followed
afterward
it
was
incredibly
sweet
and
almost
unbearable
to
finish
the
whole
thing
as
a
beerlover
im
not
sure
how
many
people
would
enjoy
this
brew
almost
no
signs
of
hops
or
balance
to
the
overly
sweet
brew
not
sure
if
id
be
willing
to
pay
another
7
to
try
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
little
sign
of
the
relatively
high
abv
it
makes
an
excellent
afterdinner
beer
but
would
probably
not
be
a
good
one
to
session
continuing
to
revisit
the
ommegang
brews
now
that
they
have
come
back
to
minnesota
i
first
had
this
beer
when
i
went
to
the
baseball
hall
of
fame
and
took
a
side
trip
to
the
brewery
i
brought
back
a
bunch
in
my
carryon
their
flagship
beer
is
very
good
a
strong
dubbel
is
how
i
would
describe
it
overall
the
price
of
the
bottle
was
a
bit
much
for
the
overall
feel
8
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
strong
this
is
a
well
done
heavier
brew
d
easy
to
finish
one
but
theres
something
about
this
beer
that
seems
a
little
more
filling
than
usual
i
kinda
feel
full
as
though
ive
just
eaten
still
a
great
beer
and
the
price
is
right
d
pretty
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
slightly
filling
very
good
representation
of
style
nice
kick
this
is
a
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
whole
evening
if
youre
in
the
belgian
mood
but
im
not
sure
if
id
be
able
to
go
past
the
one
large
bottle
without
getting
too
full
the
bottle
i
drank
was
purchased
in
spring
of
2007
so
its
been
at
least
6
months
not
counting
the
time
it
was
at
the
liquor
store
but
its
definitely
a
lot
better
than
the
time
i
had
it
fresh
at
tasting
a
while
back
only
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
it
a
very
satisfying
dark
mediumbodied
ale
d
good
for
an
ale
of
its
strength
the
only
downside
was
that
the
carbonation
sort
of
knocked
out
the
flavour
in
the
beginning
so
my
recommendation
would
be
let
this
one
sit
a
while
to
let
it
open
up
if
you
havent
yet
i
strongly
recommending
visting
ommegang
in
cooperstown
ny
and
picking
up
some
ommegana
abby
ale
at
your
local
beer
store
great
belgium
style
beer
out
of
cooperstown
have
had
this
one
in
the
past
but
this
bottle
was
bought
closer
to
the
sourceabout
an
hour
away
regrettably
i
did
not
take
notes
on
either
of
the
two
bottles
of
the
cave
aged
at
howe
caverns
ommegang
that
my
brother
and
i
had
if
memory
serves
correctly
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
less
present
and
the
beer
was
smoother
i
just
need
to
get
my
hands
on
ommegeddon
12oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite

the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
some
dark
fruits
and
spices
the
taste
is
rich
and
malty
with
some
spices
and
a
rather
dry
and
yeasty
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
suffers
a
little
from
the
high
abv
and
phenols
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
from
one
of
the
best
belgianstyle
breweries
on
the
continent
drinkability
not
so
high
due
to
the
higher
abv
but
still
allowable
2
or
3
and
you
are
feeling
rather
fine
d
delicious
rich
and
sweet
easy
to
drink
hides
its
alcohol
well
drinkability
is
above
average
for
the
style
pours
with
a
very
large
fluffy
head
nice
dark
amber
color
taste
is
complex
like
i
have
come
to
expect
in
a
belgian
style
slightly
sweet
tasting
with
spices
and
fruitiness
high
abv
and
complexity
limits
the
drinkability
but
is
quite
tasty
d
goes
down
way
too
easy
to
me
this
could
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
who
appreciates
flavor
and
impecable
smoothness
this
is
one
dark
brew
a
deep
garnet
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
fruity
pears
passion
fruits
plums
and
a
bit
of
pineapple
taste
is
dark
and
fruity
plums
and
pears
again
but
sweet
with
dark
caramel
slightly
peppery
as
it
goes
down
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bite
a
very
good
sipping
brew
my
taste
lends
more
towards
the
lighter
belgians
but
i
would
not
turn
down
this
brew
pours
dark
brown
with
a
good
initial
head
that
fades
to
a
cap
decent
lacing
the
smell
has
traditional
aromas
for
the
style
of
clove
and
banana
and
maybe
a
hint
of
cinammon
dry
malt
underneath
the
taste
is
pleasant
if
a
bit
subdued
from
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
aromas
the
flavors
are
still
similar
to
the
nose
but
there
is
less
banana
in
particular
spicy
and
dry
on
the
finish
and
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
there
is
a
good
body
to
this
beer
my
only
complaint
about
the
mouthfeel
is
that
maybe
its
a
little
spritzy
goes
down
smooth
quite
drinkable
a
well
priced
everyday
alternative
to
a
nice
belgian
an
interesting
experience
and
im
glad
i
got
it
but
i
probably
wont
bother
again
its
essential
ommegang
perhaps
more
pronounced
sweetness
and
cherries
in
error
some
are
under
the
impression
that
this
is
brewed
in
the
us
like
some
of
the
other
of
this
breweries
beers
it
is
actually
brewed
in
belgium
and
bottled
there
also
at
the
ommegang
brewery
then
sent
to
the
new
york
branch
poured
from
750
ml
bottle
with
cork
top
love
popping
those
corks
pours
very
very
dark
brown
but
upon
closer
inspection
its
actually
a
dark
amber
color
thick
dark
head
that
quickly
lowers
into
a
thin
layer
remaing
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
nice
lace
left
behind
smell
is
of
roasted
grain
some
caramel
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
very
similar
very
malty
with
a
roasted
quality
to
it
a
hint
of
caramel
and
i
swear
a
touch
of
coffee
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
slightly
lower
score
on
drinkability
due
to
the
punch
it
packs
but
overall
a
really
good
beer
very
good
beer
but
for
a
strong
dark
ale
it
seems
a
little
weak
nonetheless
this
is
definitely
worth
drinking
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
forming
a
12
inch
creamy
tan
head
leaving
very
light
spots
of
lace
the
aroma
is
not
as
strong
as
expected
consisting
of
a
strong
alcohol
presence
along
with
a
little
raisonprune
aroma
the
taste
is
also
not
as
expected
but
not
bad
strong

light
dark
fruits
noticeable
alcohol
and
maybe
some
light

thickness
very
complex
thick
mouthfeel
and
smooth

very
drinkable
belgian
overall
not
what
i
thought
it
would
be
like
but
interesting
nonetheless
smooth
mouthfeel
that
finishes
with
some
dry
carbonation
bite
making
it
a
highly
digestible
brew
this
american
brew
puts
a
lot
of
belgian
offerings
to
shame
well
done
highly
recommended
as
i
carefully
evaluate
all
the
ommegang
brews
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
easily
one
of
the
best
belgians
brewed
this
side
of
the
atlantic
d
this
is
a
great
nightcapsipping
beer
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
on
a
fairly
warm
night
and
think
it
would
be
more
enjoyable
to
come
back
to
this
fall
or
winter
overall
a
nice
abbey
ale
this
brewery
has
put
out
some
good
beers
and
this
is
not
an
exception
the
dark
fruit
malt
flavor
is
sweet
and
traces
of
the
8
5
abv
i
like
the
12oz
size
but
a
750ml
wouldnt
be
outrageous
pours
a
reddishbrown
colour
with
a
small
bubbly
head
sweet
aroma
with
some
floral
elements
to
it
and
a
little
bit
of
spicymoldypeppery
something
in
there
that
gives
it
a
unique
kick
flavour
is
dark
fruit
and
heavy
sweet
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
a
peppery
hop
undertone
good
balance
to
this
one
and
wellhidden
alcohol
liked
it
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
for
a
dark
ale
as
rich
as
this
but
i
dont
get
a
watery
sense
to
it
at
all
at
8
5
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
pours
a
nice
two
inch
head
on
top
of
a
brown
beer
with
solid
amber
highlights
a
pretty
good
looking
beer
although
the
bubbles
are
a
little
large
pretty
good
lacing
nose
is
strong
brown
sugar
and
molasses
some
quality
spices
good
although
maybe
not
the
most
complex
beer
ever
taste
is
good
some
dried
fruit
maybe
raisins
and
a
hint
of
apricot
lots
of
molasses
and
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
feel
is
a
little
thin
but
pretty
good
overall
a
solid
beer
kind
of
a
standard
belgian
dark
really
check
it
out
although
i
might
go
for
a
maudite
over
it
first
impression
of
its
taste
chocolate
and
caramel
almost
like
a
dessert
then
there
is
a
touch
of
spiciness
and
a
nice
hop
kick
followed
by
mellow
aftertaste
its
a
bit
chewy
but
very
smooth
and
drinkable
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
very
nice
sweet
smell
this
ber
gives
off
very
nice
very
dark
amber
in
appearance
with
a
huge
head
hazy
in
appearanceand
did
i
mention
darkslight
smell
of
alcohol
but
not
offensive
pretty
complex
beerslightly
tartmild
alcohol
feel
a
different
style
of
beer
that
i
havent
tried
yet
as
i
drink
more
of
an
underlying
sweetness
starts
to
take
shape
mouth
feel
is
ok
could
be
a
bit
beefier
definitely
a
once
in
a
while
beerbut
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
dthis
one
matches
up
quite
well
with
some
dubbels
from
belgium
i
think
this
is
more
like
a
dubbel
this
is
a
complex
beer
good
for
sipping
i
may
have
picked
the
wrong
month
to
enjoy
this
as
the
heaviness
is
a
bit
much
for
a
warm
day
in
nyc
very
good
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
interesting
and
very
good
thanks
again
jan
a
very
distinctive
and
contemplative
beer
and
quite
tasty
this
beer
kicks
butt
wish
i
had
more
thanks
for
the
bottle
demcorhip
ok
drinkability
i
started
this
bottle
with
a
late
dinner
and
continued
to
sip
it
through
the
evening
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
in
some
ways
like
a
liqueor
without
being
syrupy
or
having
that
cloying
sweetness
pours
a
brownish
color
aroma
is
that
of
a
belgianstyle
ale
fruity
with
raisin
tones
malt
aroma
is
apparent
the
taste
is
somewhat
malty
as
well
with
some
sourness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
smooth
but
the
flavor
leaves
me
wanting
more
then
again
id
rather
judge
a
beer
thats
been
proper
cellared
as
opposed
to
a
beer
thats
sat
on
shelves
for
months
a
wow
had
this
with
dinner
the
other
night
and
i
had
actually
not
had
it
before
poured
a
rich
deep
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
and
very
nice
retention
and
lace
smell
was
full
of
dark
fruits
prune
raisin
and
figs
with
lots
of
spices
nutmeg
and
a
hint
of
apple
taste
was
very
lively
full
bodied
smooth
and
very
crisp
alcohol
is
there
but
hardly
noticeable
as
there
is
soo
much
complex
flavor
overunning
it
overall
this
was
fantastic
a
great
belgian
ale
and
something
i
was
very
happy
to
try
i
would
defiantly
wanna
have
this
one
again
this
is
a
great
beer
the
pour
was
a
delight
to
watch
occur
the
smell
started
with
some
bright
green
apple
and
then
settled
into
a
lovely
yeasty
puff
the
first
taste
was
very
lively
on
the
tongue
like
the
citrus
youd
find
in
a
coffee
from
el
salvador
very
lovely
the
mouth
feel
is
amazing
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
lacing
is
constant
as
the
cup
goes
away
served
in
an
elongated
goblet
the
taste
is
very
nice
almost
a
honey
flavor
meets
a
dark
chocolate
highly
recommended
not
a
brew
i
was
overly
fond
of
ill
be
in
no
rush
to
drink
the
other
bottle
i
purchased
reminds
me
of
duvel
in
carbonation
and
essence
fun
to
try
but
i
don¬ít
need
another
for
quite
some
time

pours
a
dark
dark
red
brown
with
a
dense
rocky
head
the
beer
is
almost
black
and
the
head
is
a
medium
tan
nice
smell
is
fruits
with
some
esters
and
a
note
of
burnt
coffee
or
bitter
chocolate
or
both
more
subtle
than
i
would
have
expected
taste
is
very
roasted
not
fruity
at
all
it
has
a
bitter
component
that
comes
on
towards
the
end
just
before
a
very
dry
finish
interesting
but
not
what
i
expected
of
an
abbey
style
ale
mouthfeel
has
nice
carbonation
and
an
oily
texture
that
ties
it
together
well
drinkability
is
good
although
the
overroasting
the
dry
finish
keep
it
from
being
really
outstanding
i
like
this
one
but
it
really
could
do
with
being
a
bit
sweeter
still
a
great
product
from
a
great
brewery
nice
to
see
the
americans
can
do
these
styles
well
if
in
our
own
way
poured
a
dark
mahogony
color
with
carbonation
bubbles
always
flaoting
up
a
good
looking
beer
smells
great
rich
and
fruitl
not
like
the
light
wheaty
fruit
beer
this
fruity
taste
was
strong
and
heavy
and
so
was
the
taste
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
the
exact
fruit
flavors
in
the
smell
and
taste
but
im
thinking
it
was
a
darker
berry
like
grapes
or
cherries
a
well
carbonated
beer
which
balances
the
heavier
tastes
tastes
great
the
flavor
sits
well
in
the
mouth
and
the
beer
fills
the
belly
one
and
i
was
happy
and
done
easy
to
drink
and
highly
recommended
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
smell
is
sweet
with
raisons
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
of
sweet
malt
prunes
with
the
alcohol
nicely
hidden
medium
full
bodied
with
good
complexity
that
has
a
carbonation
spike
going
down
leaving
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
id
say
a
good
one
to
try
overall
an
outstanding
strong
dark
and
another
great
offering
from
ommegang
also
i
paid
only
5
99
for
this
750ml
bottle
i
had
to
look
twice
strongly
recommended
pours
out
cherrywood
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
khaki
head
that
thins
out
but
maintains
presence
nose
is
kind
of
thin
with
caramel
and
roasted
malts
some
mild
vague
fruitiness
alcohol
stands
out
flavors
come
out
very
fruity
in
the
front
with
hints
of
banana
apple
and
grape
middle
mellows
out
with
the
fruit
and
the
alcohol
comes
in
finishes
dry
with
some
astringency
from
the
roasted
malt
aftertaste
is
roasted
malt
and
dark
dried
fruits
mouthfeel
is
not
cumbersome
and
the
carbonation
makes
the
flavors
feel
lively
on
the
tongue
solid
take
on
a
belgian
but
really
not
the
most
interesting
beer
made
in
the
belgian
vein
im
watching
the
islanders
rangers
game
and
enjoying
this
brew
with
a
plate
of
gouda
cheese
and
wheat
crackers
very
drinkable
offering
i
have
to
run
my
goblet
is
empty
poured
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
slight
chocolate
aroma
with
some
red
wine
or
port
characteristics
a
tad
more
complex
than
a
dubbel
the
taste
is
a
roasted
malt
backbone
with
some
fruit
esters
prune
and
carob
definitely
some
wine
qualities
the
feel
is
a
bit
fizzy
moderate
body
finishes
dry
and
a
touch
bitter
good
drinkability
alcohol
is
hidden
well
popped
the
cork
on
this
a
nice
waft
of
smoky
effervescence
came
slowly
from
the
bottle
the
beer
is
a
dark
brownamber
color
with
a
thick
browncream
colored
head
that
leaves
small
gatherings
of
lacing
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
quite
sweet
and
complex
some
wine
characteristics
mostly
malt
fruitiness
possibly
raisins
or
dates
belgian
sugars
and
alcohol
are
all
apparent
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
also
very
winelike
with
a
warming
effect
from
the
alcohol
a
bit
of
spiciness
complements
the
belgian
sugars
and
helps
cover
the
alcohol
slightly
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
quite
a
bit
of
bubbly
creamy
carbonation
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
i
think
i
would
try
to
stick
to
a
single
750
ml
bottle
the
alcohol
does
hurt
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
slightly
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
exciting
carbonation
and
frothy
head
aromas
were
of
sweet
malts
dark
dried
fruits
and
definite
spiciness
yeasts
were
there
but
not
overpowering
brew
was
light
in
mouthfeel
though
it
had
layers
of
flavor
great
yeasty
spices
cloves
sweet
cinnamon
malty
finish
and
very
very
dry
carbonation
was
aggressive
throughout
making
the
beer
seem
lighter
while
allowing
more
flavors
to
come
through
the
high
abv
was
extremely
well
hidden
but
after
two
12
oz
bottles
i
could
feel
the
warming
effects
very
good
effort
ommegang
is
on
the
top
of
the
list
of
american
craft
brewers
as
far
as
belgians
go
pours
vry
dark
mine
had
very
little
head
there
was
a
suprising
amount
of
carbonation
the
aroma
was
not
particularly
strong
in
my
case
it
has
a
very
winelike
taste
this
wine
like
tatse
also
had
a
bittterness
too
it
its
not
a
bad
taste
could
just
be
my
own
personal
taste
but
i
do
not
find
this
brew
to
be
too
great
its
got
a
pleasant
enough
taste
but
seems
too
carbonated
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
in
the
body
very
mouthfilling
due
to
carbonation
overall
ommegang
is
very
good
right
up
on
par
with
some
of
the
best
belgium
has
to
offer
but
fresher
and
usually
cheaper
if
you
are
a
fan
of
belgian
ales
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
if
you
have
been
put
off
by
domestic
imitations
of
belgian
styles
this
will
restore
your
faith
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
mahogany
brown
with
ruby
tint
when
held
up
to
the
light
my
dt
tulip
glass
captures
the
aromatic
pleasantries
of
the
abbey
ale
quite
nicely
sweet
dark
fruit
scents
as
well
as
banana
caramel
and
maybe
some
chocolate
cherries
i
get
a
distinct
buttery
aroma
here
too
extremely
complex
and
well
done
this
smell
blows
me
away
taste
is
in
line
with
the
aroma
rich
and
malty
with
strong
fruit
flavors
plum
prune
apple
and
pear
a
very
sweet
noticeably
tart
taste
lingers
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
before
the
hop
character
finally
kicks
in
to
balance
things
out
dont
be
misled
by
my
comments
though
because
the
hops
are
here
purely
for
balance
they
play
a
bit
role
in
this
production
firm
mouthfeel
an
allaround
quality
belgian
ale
from
ommegang
very
tasty
serve
with
a
meal
or
with
dessert
d
given
the
8
5
abv
on
top
of
2yrs
of
cellaring
it
was
surprising
drinkable
still
just
dominated
by
too
much
unchecked
sweetness
to
be
highly
drinkable
really
like
to
drink
this
over
a
pretty
large
span
of
time
as
it
warms
and
transforms
a
nice
abbey
ale
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
works
well
as
a
sipper
needs
something
paired
with
it
but
im
not
sure
what
an
american
brewer
inspired
by
the
ales
made
in
belgium
brewed
this
one
to
mirror
their
inspriation
located
3624
miles
away
i
think
the
brewers
in
belgium
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
this
one
fruit
flavors
show
up
like
any
other
belgian
dark
ale
but
this
one
comes
equipped
with
a
touch
of
caramel
that
gives
it
its
own
delicious
characteristic
a
bargain
compared
to
other
imports
this
one
still
ranks
among
the
best
careful
with
the
alcohol
though
it
sneaks
up
on
you
after
a
two
year
absence
ommegang
has
returned
to
texas
this
is
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
it
pours
a
very
dark
redtinted
color
with
a
tan
head
of
foam
that
fades
pretty
quickly
nose
is
ripely
fruity
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
malty
but
not
sweet
in
flavor
with
a
touch
of
roastedness
plummy
fruit
notes
appear
after
a
moment
and
alcohol
becomes
apparent
in
the
finish
not
too
heavy
bodied
despite
the
strength
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
id
prefer
the
maudite
to
this
one
a
nice
one
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
big
beer
eric
one
dimensional
but
good
solid
4
a
well
made
fairly
drinkable
ale
that
does
a
decent
job
of
covering
up
its
alcohol
due
to
the
depth
and
richness
of
this
brew
a
good
choice
for
introducing
newbies
to
belgian
styled
brews
and
a
good
choice
even
if
not
outstanding
for
the
more
experienced
drinker
wont
be
rushing
out
for
more
but
can
see
myself
enjoying
this
one
again
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
with
no
dating
system
shipped
back
from
indy
during
xmas
before
i
heard
they
were
coming
back
to
the
texas
market
had
a
dark
cherry
almost
bloodish
color
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipated
was
tannish
the
aroma
was
sweetish
with
a
big
burgundy
front
with
a
hint
of
the
abv
the
taste
was
good
but
not
as
great
as
id
hoped
will
need
to
try
a
non
shipped
sample
now
that
they
are
back
mouthfeel
was
good
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
in
a
style
that
i
mostly
like
but
not
a
major
player
in
my
rotation
like
enough
to
have
again
in
the
12oz
size
couple
times
a
year
4
rb
t
o
quite
an
affordable
and
honest
attempt
at
a
belgian
ale
though
it
still
has
a
ways
to
go
but
if
you
like
belgian
ales
its
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
i
got
this
again
body
is
a
muddy
brown
color
with
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
topped
by
a
smallish
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
halo
rather
quickly
aroma
of
sweet
dark
malt
belgian
yeast
and
more
than
a
little
sour
acidity
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
sour
cherries
palate
is
a
complex
blend
of
dark
malt
and
candi
sugar
sweetness
offset
by
subtle
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
yeasty

finish
is
slightly
acidic

a
good
balsamic
vinegar
body
is
creamy
although
a
little
foamy
when
disturbed
drink
carefully
in
small

definitely
changed
this
beer
although
im
not
sure
that
two
years
is
not
the
optimal
age
for
it

gong
on
best
of
breed
no
very
good
yes
consistent
quality
as
good
as
i
remember
it
enjoy
i
dont
what
it
is
but
im
missing
the
boat
on
this
one
i
got
a
bottle
with
dinner
at
la
cena
just
outside
syracuse
to
go
with
some
mole
chicken
it
really
just
tasted
like
a
strong
extract
beer
to
me
tasted
of
carmelized
light
or
medium
extract
with
a
touch
of
unpleasant
hops
i
had
one
good
sip
where
i
tasted
chocolate
but
the
rest
was
nothing
to
savor
i
will
say
it
at
least
looked
the
part
and
hid
the
alcohol
someone
tell
me
what
im
missing
please
things
are
kept
lively
by
a
thick
body
with
crisp
and
strong
carbonation
alcohol
is
definitely
present
but
never
out
of
place
this
is
dessert
and
your
afterdinner
drink
all
in
one
good
stuff
this
poured
a
very
dark
ruddy
amber
with
a
34
finger
head
and
nice
lacing
some
extra
swirling
in
the
glass
brings
out
the
head
and
overall
appearance
as
well
as
the
fruity
aroma
this
is
rich
in
apples
plums
and
darker
fruits
again
rich
and
satisfying
the
taste
is
heavy
in
such
flavors
with
a
very
slight
bitter
and
an
ever
so
slight
dark
chocolate
flavoring
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
perfectly
balanced
with
a
nice
combination
of
smooth
crisp
coolness
that
pleases
the
palate
always
a
great
goto
especially
considering
the
price
d
i
dont
like
this
at
all
really
it
does
get
a
bit
better
with
more
sips
nothing
good
though
a
sea
of
sweetness
drown
more
intruiging
islands
of
delicious
earthy
malt
dark
fruit
butter
and
molasses
an
unfortunate
imbalance
because
this
beer
has
so
much
to
offer
the
smell
was
decent
but
unremakable
candy
sugar
plums
etc
the
taste
was
similarly
unimpressive
and
had
an
unbelievably
metallic
aftertaste
if
i
had
to
describe
this
beer
in
one
sentence
i
would
say
that
its
like
brussels
by
way
of
burtonontrent
i
felt
like
i
was
sucking
on
a
penny
and
poured
the
damn
thing
out
after
drinking
about
a
fourth
of
it
pours
dark
amber
with
a
creamy
head
looks
perfect
there
are
some
different
smells
going
on
honey
and
maybe
some
licorice
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
amazing
caramel
honey
notes
with
really
solid
mouthfeel
amazing
that
this
isnt
belgian
for
the
money
you
cant
get
any
better
id
pay
double
for
the
same
bottle
amazing
cant
wait
to
visit
this
brewery
like
other
ommegang
brews
too
carbonated
which
detracts
from
what
would
be
a
nice
heavy
feel
sweetish
tones
from
the
aroma
all
come
through
in
the
flavor
in
the
front
with
dark
fruits
and
a
toffee
sweetness
but
it
also
has
a
balancing
lasting
bitterness
in
the
finish
nice
balance
makes
for
very
good
drinkability
biggest
knock
from
me
is
the
excessively
fizzy
feel
taste
wow
i
have
not
had
a
complex
belgian
like
this
in
a
while
almost
wine
like
but
in
a
robust
way
lots
of
fruit
characterisitics
raisins
figs
and
a
little
nutty
yeasty
flavors
there
also
rather
carbonated
really
tart
and
i
think
mine
was
still
a
little
too
cool
as
this
warmed
up
it
got
much
richer
and
the
malt
was
a
little
more
present
hops
about
nonexistant
are
there
any
grapes
hidden
in
here
very
nice
and
it
was
much
more
inviting
as
it
warmed
up
i
like
rare
vos
a
bit
better
been
a
long
time
and
i
have
not
had
the
three
philosophers
yet
ommegang
is
a
very
good
beer
al
ittle
too
much
on
the
wine
side
for
me
but
a
tasty
treat
all
around
i
always
liked
the
jenlain
and
belgium
beer
i
move
to
the
us
and
could
not
find
a
beer
that
i
like
so
i
made
some
belgium
style
beer
this
beer
as
a
good
all
around
taste
i
love
it
i
even
went
to
the
brewery
in
cooperstown
ny
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
still
need
to
try
the
3
philosopher
from
ommegang
good
aftertaste
good
color
abit
pricy
for
a
4
pack
7
99
a
750
ml
bottle
priced
at
5
85
from
the
northcoast
coop
in
eureka
california
deep
rich
mahogany
color
with
a
light
brown
head
and
good
lacing
nose
is
very
complex
with
malts
yeast
honey
apricot
berries
prunes
caramel
and
chocolate
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
but
even
more
intense
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
somewhat
oily
dry
and
nicely
bitter
finish
excellent
overall
balance
while
not
inexpensive
this
is
really
an
excellent
belgian
strong
ale
drinkability
very
kingly
sophisticated
and
worthy
of
praise
i
look
forward
to
pairing
this
beer
with
a
meaty
dinner
or
cheese
plate
this
was
a
real
treat
at
a
great
price
i
will
be
back
for
more
mouthfeel
drinkability
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
great
beer
will
purchase
again
a
joy
to
drink
oof
i
opened
this
bottle
to
celebrate
the
day
we
brought
my
new
son
home
from
the
hospital
but
am
finding
im
too
knackered
to
do
a
decent
review
pours
a
dirty
brown
with
reasonable
head
nice
beer
complex
flavours
tastes
like
a
belgian
good
for
a
celebration
the
8
5
alcohol
and
sleep
deprivation
should
work
well
in
oh
about
10
minutes
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
from
a
top
notch
brewery
recommended
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
very
nice
deep
orange
to
red
in
color
with
a
large
amount
of
pillowy
tan
head
which
slowly
fades
into
lacing
that
continually
covers
the
surface
lots
of
dark
cherry
is
evident
in
the
nose
there
is
also
evidence
of
alcohol
taste
is
fruity
with
a
malty
backbone
and
little
caramel
there
as
well
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
although
i
think
less
carbonation
would
make
this
work
a
little
better
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
like
any
belgian
should
be
drunk
slowly
sipping
is
key
especially
because
this
warms
nicely
highly
recommended
i
love
this
beer
and
i
love
the
fact
that
its
4
99
for
a
750
at
trader
joes
and
its
perfect
with
breakfast
for
dinner
steak
and
eggs
for
me
this
evening
on
a
cold
night
when
youre
not
working
the
next
day
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
tinted
chestnut
with
good
clarity
tan
head
of
thick
fizz
quickly
fills
the
glass
showing
decent
retention
and
leaving
some
spotty
lacing
strong
raisin
aroma
also
vinous
and
fusel
are
present
but
mellow
toasty
dark
belgian
malt
and
faint
styrian
hop
scent
with
soft
lactobacillus
and
fruity
phenols
in
the
background
the
initial
taste
is
of
dark
munich
and
aromatic
malt
followed
by
a
maltdriven
raisin
flavor
a
solid
caramel
malt
base
and
appropriate
styrian
flavor
and
bitterness
the
afteraste
exhibits
some
medicinal
phenols
a
lambicesque
fruit
character
and
slight
vinous
alcohol
this
is
very
well
balanced
ale
with
plenty
of
complexity
that
represents
the
style
well
as
well
as
abbey
beers
in
general
the
medium
body
is
wellattentuated
but
retains
enough
malt
character
so
as
to
not
be
too
dry
the
medium
cabonation
is
extra
fine
adding
a
level
of
crispness
without
being
overly
fizzy
finishes
with
lots
of
residual
raisin
and
ripe
fruit
flavor
along
with
a
boozey
warming
sensation
but
still
holds
a
fair
drinkability
the
label
says
it
was
brewed
and
bottled
in
belgium
at
the
duvel
brewery
apparently
to
meet
demand
with
such
high
quality
at
the
affordable
price
its
obvious
why
ommegang
is
becoming
so
popular
pours
an
opaque
purplebrown
with
significant
tan
head
and
good
lacing
essences
of
blackberrycherry
taste
is
of
a
blackberryplum
with
some
light
grains
and
good
forward
hoppiness
mouth
feel
is
a
good
full
one
very
creamy
with
a
little
thickness
to
it
a
well
crafted
combination
it
finishes
dry
with
some
hints
as
to
its
8
5
abv
i
would
certainly
drink
again
the
taste
was
quite
enjoyable
nice
rolling
sweet
malt
flavors
mixed
with
the
light
fruit
mild
hints
of
dried
fruit
and
caramel
nice
chewy
raisiny
taste
quite
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
feels
smooth
and
silky
in
the
mouth
the
malt
flavor
was
balanced
with
a
light
dry
finish
the
fruity
esters
seem
to
cling
to
the
pallet
and
allow
for
a
nice
mixing
of
the
many
flavors
captured
in
this
brew
they
have
created
a
well
balance
beer
that
has
many
complex
features
from
the
nose
to
the
finish
the
tangy
flavors
jump
around
the
pallet
well
crafted
beer
and
i
certainly
will
try
again
it
has
a
nice
strong
smooth
taste
im
new
to
belgians
so
i
dont
know
that
many
but
i
know
that
i
like
this
one
and
i
often
have
one
in
my
refridgerator
again
most
drinkable
split
a
750ml
and
wish
i
had
more

slight

coats
the

at
first
with
a

but
ends
with
a
dry

medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
glad
this
one
comes
in
a
big
bottle
overall
a
nice
dubbel
ale
that
i
would
certainly
entertain
with
again
drinkability
lovely
definately
very
drinkable
great
flavor
overtones
really
make
this
beer
shine
md
again
bubbly
and
heavy
it
seems
to
have
a
little
more
of
a
bite
than
other
beers
in
this
style
that
i
have
tried
i
am
really
working
on
drinking
more
belgian
style
ales
to
get
my
vocabulary
and
description
up
im
sure
ill
get
better
as
i
drink
more
overall
a
wonderful
beer
and
very
affordable
dark
brown
almost
completel
opaque
body
with
three
fingers
of
head
that
slowly
dissipates
smells
chocolatey
with
some
fruit
and
alcohol
notes
tastes
fruity
maybe
of
grape
with
a
little
citrus
with
more
chocolate
at
the
finish
rather
wellballanced
between
the
two
alcohol
while
present
is
not
very
noticeable
on
the
higher
end
of
mediumbodied
with
a
pleasant
silky
smooth
texture
definitely
a
sipper
but
very
enjoyable
especially
for
cold
late
fall
and
winter
nights
like
tonight
the
alcohol
is
so
wellhidden
it
creeps
up
on
you
an
excellent
beer
and
a
steal
at
5
per
750ml
bottle
fantastic
worthwhile
ale
d
why
does
it
have
to
end
to
hell
with
its
8
5
abv
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
be
satisfied
to
be
stranded
on
an
island
with
i
would
drink
a
six
of
this
all
by
myself
or
empty
a
few
750s
casually
and
slowly
enjoying
every
drop
its
so
damn
tasty
and
so
easy
to
drink
few
beers
have
been
so
pleasing
decentsized
head
and
a
very
dark
brown
color
malty
spicy
belgian
aroma
with
some
alcohol
aroma
too
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
roasty
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
dry
finish
and
a
warming
feel
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
pretty
drinkable
but
has
some
strength
at
8
5
abv
pours
a
deep
red
mahogany
in
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
settles
down
to
just
a
coating
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
dark
dried
fruits
plums
and
cherries
come
to
mind
a
hint
of
yeast
and
some
dark
possibly
toasted
malts
not
overpowering
but
overall
very
pleasant
taste
is
of
the
dark
fruits
and
caramel
with
some
sweetnees
and
a
mere
hint
of
malts
the
malt
presence
was
in
my
opinion
lacking
all
of
these
flavors
hit
you
upfront
but
disappear
almost
immediately
good
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
a
little
bit
high
and
is
medium
bodied
as
for
drinkanbility
could
i
have
another
sure
why
not
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
and
its
an
ok
brew
but
really
nothing
special
a
great
ale
it
can
easily
run
with
and
even
pull
to
the
front
of
the
belgian
pack
from
across
the
pond
great
malt
complexity
balanced
by
equally
complex
hop
and
spice
additions
the
alchol
is
well
hidden
definitely
worth
a
try
if
not
regular
rotation
in
your
drinking
regimen
d
very
good
this
is
pleasant
in
the
mouth
but
absolutely
heaven
in
the
nose
i
would
buy
this
again
just
to
sniff
it
i
would
drink
this
again
in
a
new
york
belgian
brewery
minute
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
with
my
meal
and
as
itself
750ml
caged
corked
bottle
poured
into
two
medium
sized
snifters
dark
copper
in
color
as
it
settles
a
more
opaque
red
wine
like
appearance
smell
is
massive¬ókiwi
rum
soaked
raisins
some
caramel
and
toffeeish
notes
and
traces
of
alcohol
the
initial
sips
are
twangy
carbonated
sweet
malts
the
body
quickly
reveals
some
syrupy
and
cotton
candy
tastes
dark
chocolate
cherries
and
tinges
of
alcohol
are
there
easy
to
detect
raisins
caramel
malts
and
brown
sugar
round
out
the
end
an
american
grown
belgian
strong
dark
ale
available
in
my
area
say
it
ain¬ít
so
a
liquid
joy
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
finger
of
head
the
foam
falls
quickly
and
leaves
behind
a
ring
of
lace
the
aroma
is
toffee
and
fruity
estersphenols
the
flavor
is
fairly
malty
with
the
same
carameltoffee
flavors
with
8
5
alcohol
its
a
stong
beer
but
the
body
and
flavors
do
a
very
good
job
at
masking
that
strength
the
body
is
great
heavy
enough
so
you
know
its
there
but
not
so
high
as
to
make
the
beer
overly
sweet
its
quite
a
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
rich
mildly
boozy
with
a
jumpy
caramel
blast
of
richness
in
the
full
bodied
brew
doesnt
get
a
whole
lot
better
than
this
nice
sour
oak
flavor
citrus
fruits
yeasts
malts
alcohol
metallic
flavors
very
complex
good
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
a
solid
ommegang
offering
at
a
ridiculously
low
price
not
the
biggest
tasting
belgian
ale
but
very
drinkable
and
highly
enjoyable
bought
surprisingly
from
local
liquor
store
for
6
99
with
out
tax
poured
into
my
chalice
a
nice
dark
brown
with
some
warm
red
highlights
first
off
i
must
mention
that
the
head
which
was
quite
thick
and
pleasing
had
a
color
of
off
white
that
had
almost
a
neon
green
hint
to
it
when
i
look
at
the
lacing
on
this
beer
i
think
of
sea
foam
the
nose
is
of
raisons
brown
sugar
plum
dark
cherries
some
other
dark
fruity
esters
a
little
hop
funk
and
some
minor
yeasty
bread
notes
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
as
the
smell
tastes
a
bit
crisp
with
some
carbonation
there
are
some
nice
malt
characteristics
in
this
but
it
is
constantly
fighting
for
supremacy
with
bitter
belgian
maybe
saaz
hops
which
is
not
bad
at
all
but
could
be
better
i
could
denfinitly
drink
this
beer
theres
other
bsdas
i
like
i
think
i
like
better
but
this
is
damn
nice
try
it
worth
trying
in
the
larger
corked
bottle
i
think
drinks
very
easy
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
a
best
buy
at
5
50
for
750ml
this
beer
is
quite
fruity
and
for
those
who
dont
mind
a
decent
sugar
content
i
think
very
drinkable
a
very
solid
overall
ale
beer
poured
out
a
beautiful
dark
mahoganey
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
stuck
around
a
while
and
great
lacing
throughout
smell
was
good
with
nice
malt
scents
followed
with
some
nice
dark
fruit
aromas
great
tasting
beer
many
flavors
coming
through
some
nice
roasted
malt
as
well
as
raisins
caramel
and
a
nice
balanced
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
full
almost
frothy
beer
really
comes
to
life
in
the
mouth
top
notch
very
drinkable
exceptional
beer
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thinner
than
expected
and
a
bit
fizzy
initially
yet
still
rich
and
creamy
750
ml
caged
corked
bottle
says
brewed
and
bottled
exceptionally
in
belgium
nice
yeasty
dark
overripened
fruity
aromas
caramel

like
aromas
from
the
malts
nice
looking

handsome
i
would
say
murky
dense
brown
with
a
lovelly
tight

very
rich
deep
maltyfruity
taste
followed
by
a
very
noticable
alcoholic
strength
spicy
with
some
citric
aftertaste
tastes
also
of
darker
autumnal
berries
even
redcurrants
come
to
mind
the
palate
was
not
the
strongest
part
of
this
beer
though
some
may
like
the
drying
after
glow
i
did
not
its
my
preference
but
i
like
a
slightly
more
flavourful
and
¬íwet
finish
overall
a
good
beer
i
was
going
to
say
for
an
american
belgian
style
but
then
its
brewed
in
belgium
whatever
its
a
good
beer
and
very
good
value
at
4
50
a
750
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
tradition
of
belgian
brewing
quite
dissapointed
with
this
stuff
all
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
pretty
bland
the
spice
character
is
almost
unpleasant
the
malt
presense
is
utterly
weak
and
the
hops
offer
not
much
else
worth
a
try
and
ill
be
trying
another
bottle
in
the
near
future
hoping
that
this
was
a
bad
bottle
or
something
hennepin
was
such
a
fantastic
saison
that
i
guess
i
expected
the
same
quality
from
ommegangs
strong
dark
ale
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
thick
head
it
smelled
of
dark
roasted
grains
and
yeasts
the
taste
is
very
dark
and
chewy
it
has
a
great
feel
in
the
mouth
it
tastes
like
thick
dark
breads
my
roommate
compared
it
to
a
roast
beef
sandwich
i
find
this
to
be
an
excelent
beer
and
will
definatly
go
looking
for
it
again
devilly
dilectable
its
so
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
every
sip
when
the
bottle
was
gone
i
wanted
one
more
drink
overall
a
great
belgian
abbey
another
superior
product
from
upstate
new
york
im
damn
lucky
to
live
here
god
bless
america
¬Öand
only
5
99
a
bottle
exceptional
value
ommegang
continues
to
be
the
best
way
to
get
into
belgium
brews
on
a
budget
in
the
usa
but
don¬ít
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
these
beers
are
¬ìcheap¬î
for
they
are
not
they
are
high
quality
brews
sold
at
a
very
competitive
price
and
i
continue
to
pick
them
up
in
preference
to
many
socalled
belgium
style
beers
brewed
locally
often
at
half
the
quality
of
ommegang
and
sold
at
twice
the
price
this
is
still
a
benchmark
beer
don¬ít
let
familiarity
or
your
quest
for
new
beers
have
you
pass
it
over
the
complexity
compounds
when
it
hits
your
tongue
wow
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
bubbly
and
light
on
the
tongue
aromatic
bittersweet
aftertaste
warms
you
quickly
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
is
a
real
treat
to
enjoy
with
a
couple
people
not
too
expensive
either
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
a
very
good
abbey
ale
i
will
have
this
again
pours
a
rich
almost
garnet
brownish
red
with
a
thick
resilient
head
a
rich
fruity
aroma
and
a
taste
to
match
strong
esters
from
warm
fermentation
shine
through
the
malt
flavor
almost
tastes
raw
as
if
the
beer
were
brewed
with
antique
equipment
you
can
taste
every
element
of
the
beer
and
it
holds
up
sip
after
sip
fantastic
d
a
slow
and
steady
sipper
with
a
lot
of
nice
qualities
i
will
only
buy
this
in
750ml
packaging
because
it
seems
just
the
right
amount
for
my
enjoyment
4
99
cant
beat
that
d
strong
brew
best
to
sip
many
flavors
to
decifer
drinkability
definitely
something
to
sip
through
a
couple
hours
as
the
alchohol
is
very
up
front
in
this
brew
poured
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
of
fruit
and
caramel
maltiness
definite
honey
taste
upfront
some
sweetness
dark
fruits
turns
alittle
sour
with
a
malty
chewy
mouthfeel
slight
alcohol
burn
on
the
way
down
drinkablity
after
a
few
it¬ís
a
little
much
it¬ís
like
eating
too
much
pie
enjoying
every
bite
but
start
to
feel
a
little
overwhelmed
plus
with
all
of
those
bubbles
carrying
the
8
5
abv
to
your
head
it
might
be
wise
to
space
these
out
drinkability
and
other
notes
not
to
crazy
about
this
beer
possibly
i
have
a
bottle
that
has
seen
better
days
beautiful
dark
rubymahogany
color
body
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
settles
down
in
fairly
short
order
the
smell
is
sweet
but
sharp
alcohol
is
in
the
nose
as
is
burnt
caramel
taste
isnt
as
smooth
as
id
hoped
it
bites
you
back
and
has
a
certain
astringency
that
i
wasnt
expecting
its
good
but
could
use
a
little
more
malty
sweetness
up
front
to
balance
things
out
mouthfeel
is
medium
creamy
with
light
carbonation
pours
a
thick
brown
ale
with
a
firm
head
that
permiates
roasted
malts
and
caramel
heavy
carbonation
and
champagne
like
qualities
run
throughout
the
nose
is
filled
with
nuts
berries
and
bannana
they
reccomend
drinking
this
at
50
degrees
but
this
beers
is
awsome
from
start
to
finish
i
insist
on
pairing
this
with
a
steak
a
fabulous
belgian
beer
and
would
put
this
up
with
any
european
style
another
stellar
beer
from
ommegang
and
cant
wait
to
see
what
they
come
up
with
next
notesone
of
my
favorite
belgian
style
ales
i
think
its
right
up
there
with
the
imported
belgian
alesbut
for
a
fraction
of
the
price
i
first
had
this
one
at
a
beer
tasting
put
on
my
the
ommegang
brewery
at
the
pizza
plant
in
buffalo
ny
this
beer
is
becoming
easier
to
find
outside
of
new
york
ive
picked
it
up
at
a
krogers
in
raleigh
nc
and
at
total
wine
in
jacksonville
fl
at
around
4
00
for
a
750
ml
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
750
ml
poured
into
a
gold
rimmed
ommegang
chalice
initially
a
large
wall
of
foam
which
lends
way
to
very
carbonated
brew
with
little
foam
left
rather
quickly
nice
dark
fig
plum
and
dark
amber
brown
color
tastes
spicy
and
slightly
fruity
note
nearly
as
complex
as
some
true
belgian
monastery
ales
but
for
about
4
50
at
750ml
a
treat
for
the
price
this
is
a
super
sipper
perhaps
a
good
choice
to
bring
to
dinner
when
you¬íre
asked
to
bring
wine
a
wonderful
beer
to
stock
up
on
d
a
wonderful
beer
excellent
flavors
warm
and
enchanting
a
sipper
seems
most
appropriate
with
dessert
as
a
nightcap
or
a
winter
warmer
definitely
a
must
try
this
beer
pours
a
rich
mahogany

with
a
small
but
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
notes
of
raisins
and
plums
standing
out
the
most
and
a
slight
alcohol
note
in
there
as
well
taste
is
very
complex
with
sweet
toasty
malts
up
front
followed
by
notes
of
caramel
and
cocoa
finish
is
somewhat
dry
with
a
pleasant
alcohol
warmth
that
follows
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
very
smooth
for
a
beer
this
big
as
for
drinkability
abv
means
nothing
in
this
case
this
is
great
beer
and
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
this
available
drink
up
also
at
the
price
you
can
get
this
one
for
5

for
my
750ml
bottle
you
cant
go
wrong
drinkabilityoverall
a
year
and
many
hundred
beers
later
i
can
finally
appreciate
all
this
beer
has
to
offer
just
a
ridiculous
amount
of
flavor
development
for
one
beer
and
balanced
well
to
boot
a
steal
at
twice
the
price
the
pinnacle
of
american
belgianstyle
brewing
granted
this
was
actually
brewed
in
belgium
a
full
bodied
brew
it
came
across
like
a
sour
champaign
drinkability
awesome
complex
and
strong
without
being
overpowering
great
development
keeps
you
guessing
while
the
deftness
of
the
brew
leaves
it
well
within
its
style
and
at
the
price
this
is
a
steal
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
to
a
amber
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
was
that
of
malt
and
nut
early
but
as
the
glass
watrmed
the
aroma
became
more
dark
fruit
and
a
more
noticeable
alcohol
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
finish
at
first
in
that
it
was
slightly
watery
however
as
beer
warmed
at
midglass
palte
was
much
more
full
and
smooth
and
the
alcohol
gave
a
warming
sensation
on
the
way
down
id
feel
this
were
a
lot
more
drinkable
if
the
carbonation
was
less
intense
otherwise
a
well
balanced
beer
this
brew
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
creamy
and
long
lasting
the
aroma
of
caramel
pepper
and
other
spices
the
taste
has
a
bit
more
caramel
than
other
belgain
strong
darks
i
have
had
the
caramel
seems
to
dominate
the
spices
although
there
are
some
nice
yeast
tones
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
isnt
the
best
belgain
strong
dark
i
have
had
but
it
is
thoroughly
enjoyable

a
dark
copper
with
ruby

tremendous
thick
and
creamy
head
that
stays
throughout
the
entire
session
absolutely
beautiful
looking
beer
smelled
of
dark
fruit
ie
figs
raisins
etc
maybe
some
yeast
a
tad
of
bananas
mediciny
too
also
tasted
of
the
dark
fruits
along
with
hints
of
toffee
and
slight
yeast
taste
ends
off
with
a
burgundy
wine
tasting
alcohol
warming
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
creamy
extremely
bubbly
like
champagne
at
first
but
dies
down
after
10
minutes
or
so
fairly
drinkable
but
could
be
better
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
actually
i
feel
that
this
beer
would
be
immensely
better
after
aging
maybe
a
year
or
so
im
gonna
have
to
buy
a
few
bottles
and
approach
that
idea
very
excellent
and
highly
worth
checking
out
it
looks
dark
brown
at
first
glance
but
really
its
closer
to
a
deep
ruby
it
poured
with
a
generous
light
brown
head
that
left
behind
considerable
creamy
lacing
as
it
fell
aromas
of
sweet
dried
fruits
raisins
prunes
as
well
as
fresh
plums
with
a
hints
of
dark
nutty
malts
bready
yeast
and
spicy
alcohol
wow
nice
complexity
while
keeping
everything
balanced
plenty
of
malty
fruity
sweetness
to
start
followed
by
notes
of
plums
slight
bitterness
and
licorice
theres
also
a
bit
of
clove
just
before
the
alcohol
warmth
kicks
in
at
the
finish
dry
on
the
palate
mediumfull
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
creamy
mellow
texture
this
is
quality
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
had
no
problem
finishing
off
the
750ml
myself
over
the
course
of
a
couple
hours
d
the
complexity
of
this
beer
was
lost
somewhere
instead
of
my
palatte
not
knowing
what
wonderful
taste
to
concentrate
on
i
found
myself
just
trying
not
to
taste
the
sharp
alcohol
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
i
expected
more
from
ommegang
so
i
plan
on
grabbing
another
of
these
bottles
and
reviewing
again
drinkability
this
is
very
good
goes
down
well
but
it
is
more
of
a
sipping
brew
and
would
seem
to
require
drinking
with
a
meal
and
also
the
high
abv
limits
it
to
one
per
session
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
a
gorgeous
ruby
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
nice
fine
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
notes
of
fruit
and
chocolate
along
with
noticable
alcohol
also
a
slight
metallic
smell
that
fades
away
nice
and
sweet
with
plum
and
caramel
flavors
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
alcohol
velvety
and
rich
with
just
enough
carbonation
making
this
beer
impressive
and
enjoyable
to
drink
a
world
class
beer
from
a
us
brewery
having
their
belgian
style
ale
brewed
in
belgium
by
a
world
class
brewery
go
figure
pours
a
dark
garnet
color
with
just
a
modest
head
for
a
belgian
smell
is
very
sweet
and
fruitysmells
somehow
of
yogurtcovered
raisins
flavor
is
good
but
comes
off
immediately
as
somewhat
medicinal
nevertheless
it
still
has
that
fabulous
proofthatgodlovesme
strong
belgian
dark
ale
flavor
there
are
chocolate
notes
as
well
as
the
follow
up
rememberances
of
the
yogurtcovered
raisins
its
alrighti
would
choose
others
first
judged
against
others
of
its
style
truly
an
american
craft
beer
classic
this
beer
left
me
with
quiet
an
impression
very
dark
amber
pour
with
nice
creamy
white
head
looks
like
a
serious
beer
smell
is
stong
reminds
me
of
sweet
dried
fruit
taste
is
great
again
strong
malt
presence
with
a
raisin
like
aftertaste
it
has
a
smoothness
but
never
loses
its
edge
it
seems
the
more
sips
you
take
the
stronger
the
beer
becomes
a
big
brew
for
me
cant
really
drink
too
much
of
it
but
i
certainly
appreciate
how
well
made
it
is
i
have
to
say
good
as
this
beer
is
i
expected
a
little
more
complexity
more
layers
good
beer
complex
and
interesting
not
my
favorite
ommegang
that
honor
goes
to
hennepin
but
still
enjoyable
this
one
had
a
rather
large
hop
bitterness
which
i
thought
was
a
bit
too
much
otherwise
really
nice
poured
from
a
corked
and
caged
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
had
a
dark
reddish
brown
appearance
with
a
large
1
inch
light
tan
head
there
was
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
aroma
was
malty
and
caramelly
with
some
hop
aroma
in
the
backround
taste
was
of
malt
dark
fruits
maple
syrup
and
a
fruitiness
that
reminded
me
of
caramel
covered
apples
this
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
considering
the
8
5
abv
not
bad
for
the
price
either

maltsas
it
warmed
up
stared
to
get
a
semi
sweet

wine
like
quality
liked
the
finish
on
this
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
that
lasted
just
right
lively
carbonation
helps
it
slide
right
down
the
throat
and
leaves
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
mouth
a
great
example
of
an
american
belgian
it
doesnt
quite
replace
chimay
in
my
top
slot
but
its
a
good
affordable
amd
delightful
brew
i
had
a
hard
time
taking
more
than
one
glass
due
to
the
tart
and
bitter
alcohol
at
the
forefront
both
warm
and
cold
its
hard
to
focus
on
the
real
flavours
underneath
tmfd
everything
that
makes
the
regular
abbey
great
is
there
but
better
medium
bodied
but
rich
with
burnt
ripe
fruits
which
give
a
toasty
sweetness
caramel
and
alittle
spicecloves
is
in
there
too
slight
warming
alcohol
kick
this
is
a
mellowed
beer
with
any
rough
edges
from
the
original
smoothed
out
more
drinkable
than
the
regular
abbey
not
too
cloying
substantial
carbonation
but
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
in
fact
it
helps
leave
a
sharp
and
satisfying
conclusion
to
a
great
beer
did
i
say
smokey
yes
not
in
the
way
of
a
smoked
beer
but
a
nice
mellow
smoked
toastiness
to
the
sweet
malt
that
keeps
it
from
becoming
cloying
the
flavor
is
quite
darker
than
i
expected
extremely
smooth
and
slightly
smokey
figs
and
a
woody
smoked
tone
make
the
flavor
deep
and
rich
finish
is
dry
and
smokey
alcohol
is
virtually
undetectable
considering
it
weighs
in
at
8
5
i
came
back
to
it
after
a
few
minutes
and
it
didnt
strike
me
as
improved
with
time
or
air
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
ale
either
on
tap
or
with
a
fat
roast
beef
sandwhich
this
fall
as
the
winter
will
be
approaching
once
again
pours
a
muddy
reddish
brown
with
a
smooth
tan
head
that
lasted
strong
and
warming
with
the
promised
burgundy
notes
with
cherry
caramel
and
an
evident
breadiness
the
taste
showed
complexity
as
it
warmed
and
tasted
more
winelike
the
alcohol
was
evident
as
well
though
i
was
tempted
to
have
a
second
i
drank
it
with
a
mediumrare
rib
steak
which
was
a
very
nice
pairing
would
love
to
try
again
soon
preferable
with
another
steak
pours
dark
caramel
with
moderate
carbonation
and
an
impressive
rocky
buttermilk
head
suprisingly
weak
on
the
nose
but
with
spicy
hints
of
cinammon
and
caramel
malt
pretty
mild
for
what
i¬íve
come
to
expect
from
a
belgian
medium
heavy
body
lightly
carbonated
not
a
lot
of
kick
going
down
hopped
spices
and
vague
fruitiness
with
a
faint
hint
of
alcohol
to
finish
it
off
really
pretty
underwhelming
for
what
i
expect
out
of
a
belgian
maybe
i¬íve
just
had
too
many
sterling
examples
recently
to
be
impressed
by
something
that¬ís
only
chimay
caliber
scored
higher
overall
due
to
greater
drinkability
at
this
price
which
can
be
fully
half
what
you¬íd
pay
for
the
average
belgian
import
pours
very
dark
with
a
big
foamy
tan
head
holding
it
up
to
the
light
reveals
a
deep
burgundy
color
the
head
dissipates
slightly
but
retains
a
thin
lacing
right
through
the
finish
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
and
the
taste
is
the
same
very
smooth
and
balanced
the
taste
shields
the
8
5
abv
which
you
dont
much
feel
until
polishing
off
the
first
half
of
the
750ml
bottle
and
standing
up
to
get
the
second
half
i
prefer
the
taste
as
it
begins
to
warm
when
the
malty
flavors
really
come
out
and
a
bit
of
a
bite
that
is
evident
when
too
cold
really
smooths
out
quality
brew
that
makes
a
nice
treat
this
is
a
dark
dark
beer
rich
fruity
complex
and
just
really
full
all
around
oh
yeah
this
is
quality
stuff
right
here
this
is
a
good
beer
complex
and
enjoyable
for
sure
but
there
is
also
something
too
methodical
about
it
it
could
achieve
greatness
with
more
of
a
wild
side
pours
a
lovely
mahogany
crystal
clear
and
brownred
with
a
slight
fluffy
khaki
head
the
aroma
is
dark
and
caramelly
with
notes
of
sweet
malt
and
raisins
taste
is
complex
and
totally
delicious
rich
but
not
heavy
full
of
dark
fruits
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
round
spicy
finish
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
light
with
a
little
bit
of
heat
excellent
notes
overall
when
you
consider
price
per
quality
this
is
just
average
this
is
my
favorite
style
and
to
be
honest
this
comes
up
short
ommegang
abbey
ale
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
aroma
is
fruity
when
it
warms
it
is
more
malty
with
caramel
being
evident
taste
is
in
turns
fruity
maltycaramel
and
maybe
a
bit
of
sour
apple
its
also
a
bit
peppery
in
the
finish
although
the
alcohol
isnt
overpowering
it
is
noticeable
to
me
doesnt
knock
my
socks
completely
off
but
its
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
i
buy
a
lot
of
beer
and
this
one
is
probably
top
of
my
list
i
love
this
beer
all
in
all
i
would
buy
it
again
perhaps
in
the
availible
750ml
corked
bottle
i
will
also
be
trying
ommegangs
other
offerings
this
is
a
very
nice
and
complex
brew
i
definitely
recommend
it
drinkability
it
tastes
great
so
that
wouldnt
be
a
barrier
to
my
consuming
this
in
mass
quantities
its
the
alcohol
content
that
would
be
the
limiting
factor
a
session
with
this
would
probably
be
a
bad
idea
ommegang
abbey
is
one
of
my
favorites
great
beer
awesome
flavor
this
beer
is
certainly
a
contender
among
any
authentic
belgian
beer
and
for
us
americans
as
a
very
reasonable
price
tag
way
too
drinkable
so
smooooth
and
easy
overall
a
phenomenallooking
good
tasting
brew
another
example
of
wellcrafted
belgian
style
beer
made
in
north
america
if
youre
feeling
bold
and
adventurous
or
just
happen
to
like
very
sweet
fruity
dark
belgian
ales
give
it
a
go
had
this
at
the
blind
tiger
this
is
delicious
on
tap
absolutely
delicious
the
flavor
is
deeper
richer
meatier
complex
coffee
flavors
dark
fruits
bitter
espresso
just
delicious
chewy
and
creamy
and
a
sneaky
eight
and
a
half
percent
more
people
need
to
get
this
on
tap
asap
verdict
this
one
takes
the
strong
dark
ale
style
and
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
subtle
and
nuanced
yet
still
pleasantly
rougharoundtheedges
truly
world
class
drinkability
this
is
actually
one
of
the
most
drinkable
belgian
strong
ales
ive
had
the
label
says
not
to
disturb
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
i
found
that
i
prefer
it
with
it
actually
somehow
manages
to
mellow
out
the
beer
a
bit
pretty
interesting
brew
this
is
a
nice
beer
its
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
and
some
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
fruity
odor
as
well
as
some
malt
the
taste
is
great
a
sweet
fruitplumraisincitrus
with
some
caramel
and
hops
in
there
too
it
was
just
a
tiny
bit
too
carbonated
for
me
but
overall
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
this
tastes
more
like
a
dubbel
than
a
dark
ale
and
is
one
of
the
tastier
ones
ive
had
plum
cherry
and
even
notes
of
fig
are
present
smell
does
not
conceal
the
alcohol
at
all
plenty
of
phenols
here
there
is
a
slight
grassy
taste
to
it
similar
to
a
saison
that
seems
to
be
a
typical
feature
of
many
dubbels
could
be
the
hops
but
im
not
positive
overall
id
say
this
is
an
above
average
belgian
style
better
than
many
actual
belgians
ive
had
this
is
def
a
good
deal
at
5
69
will
i
drink
it
again
definitely
will
i
seek
it
out
probably
not
too
often
all
in
all
recommended
it
may
be
just
what
youre
looking
for
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
out
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
large
head
great
lacing
too
you
can
smell
the
hops
and
spices
instantly
the
hop
and
spice
taste
is
apparent
at
first
sip
it
also
has
a
slight
bitter
kick
to
it
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
it
is
very
drinkable
but
due
to
the
high
abv
i
would
only
have
one
great
american
belgium
brew
ss
another
strong
offering
from
the
boys
at
ommegang
not
as
good
as
heneppin
but
better
than
rare
vos
in
my
pecking
order
delicious
good
size
brownish
red
head
that
that
lasts
long
and
even
tastes
great
once
you
get
to
the
dark
amber
liquid
though
it¬ís
a
real
treat
taste
of
cherries
was
most
prominent
for
me
but
not
overpowering
i
did
note
the
chocolate
and
caramel
too
a
little
too
robust
to
drink
a
bunch
at
a
time
you
want
to
savor
it
like
a
fine
wine
after
fighting
with
the
cork
for
a
while
pours
a
flakey
bronze
into
a
stemmed
tulip
glass
small
bubbles
of
carbonation
make
up
the
great
tan
head
very
aromatic
musty
oak
and
flowery
with
hints
of
caramel
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
and
fruit
dance
on
the
tongue
while
the
slight
alcohol
burn
is
surprising
for
only
being
8
higher
in
alcohol
percent
and
mouthfeel
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
fine
product
from
ommegang
i
like
hennepin
better
but
this
is
also
good
poured
to
celebrate
my
acceptance
into
an
mfa
program
i
was
hoping
to
get
into
and
a
wonderful
celebratory
beer
this
is
i
have
had
my
eye
on
this
beer
in
particular
for
several
months
now
i
finally
ran
across
it
again
and
couldnt
help
but
get
a
couple
bottles
this
is
a
heavily
carbonated
beer
so
the
cork
goes
flying
when
you
pop
it
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
aroma
i
used
a
tulip
glass
which
supported
a
healthy
head
throughout
the
whole
experience
the
color
was
a
nice
brown
with
a
tint
of
red
it
was
alittle
cloudy
due
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
this
beer
has
a
great
taste
to
it
too
the
malt
is
obviously
the
center
of
attention
but
there
is
still
a
good
hoppy
flavor
in
it
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
for
ale
lovers
taste
is
piney
malty
with
a
shy
hoppy
balanced
note
that
comes
with
alcohol
flavors
and
end
with
some
cherry
feels
d
solid
brew
but
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
carbonation
for
my
liking
a
special
occasion
beer
if
ive
ever
had
it
is
meanty
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
thats
what
i
did
the
booze
and
the
flavor
keep
me
from
slamming
it
so
thats
a
good
thing
good
full
body
tons
of
flavor
and
plenty
of
alcohol
give
an
exquisite
mouthfeel
that
makes
the
tastebuds
sing
as
you
swallow
makes
you
want
more
but
this
one
is
a
sipper
not
a
sessioner
no
doubt
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
gulden
draak
chalice
beer
presents
itself
as
a
dark
burgundy
color
that
is
slightly
cloudy
thick
coffeefoam
colored
head
with
good
retention
and
delicate
lacing
inside
the
glass
nose
is
malty
spicy
and
nutty
sweet
mollasseslike
malts
are
predominant
with
mulled
cideresqe
spices
after
the
initial
alcohol
burn
and
malt
sweetness
you
can
detect
the
nutty
taste
as
well
this
is
a
mediumheavy
bodied
dubbel
with
high
carbonation
and
noticable
alcohol
content
a
good
example
of
the
style
from
this
american
brewery
sweet
and
very
warm
not
overly
spiced
or
cloying
though
well
crafted
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
after
having
been
cellared
a
year
or
two
a
great
brew
one
thats
becoming
more
prevalent
in
these
handydandy
12oz
bottles
overall
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
its
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
spicy
and
bitter
i
recently
toured
the
brewery
and
they
described
that
anise
is
used
to
flavor
this
beer
now
its
easier
to
pick
out
that
flavor
notes
hoping
this
is
a
bad
bottle
will
tryreview
again
i
prefer
the
other
ommegang
offerings
but
as
with
the
others
a
good
value
at
5
bucks
a
750ml
if
youre
looking
for
something
rich
and
different
on
a
budget
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
an
ommegang
glass
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brownamber
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
with
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
deep
caramel
and
malt
bomb
that
is
really
enjoyable
you
gets
hints
of
the
high
abv
but
it
is
masked
pretty
well
in
this
the
taste
is
more
of
the
malt
and
caramel
from
the
smell
and
with
some
good
carbonation
to
balance
it
out
the
beer
gives
you
a
good
aftertaste
and
i
find
it
fairly
drinkable
even
for
8
5
pours
carmely
brown
into
the
glass
inch
or
so
of
foam
and
nice
lacing
down
the
inside
of
the
glass
sweet
carmel
and
raisin
aromas
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
taste
is
as
i
suspected
raisin
licorice
and
maybe
a
little
nutty
very
very
nice
i
could
get
in
trouble
with
this
beer
definitley
recommended
figured
id
give
the
version
brewed
in
belgium
a
go
pours
a
brillant
crimson
amber
hue
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
retains
well
the
aroma
has
big
dark
fruits
plum
cherry
grape
and
fig
candied
sugar
belgian
yeast
spice
corriander
clove
pepper
and
a
slight
alcohol
presence
the
flavor
starts
out
with
some
dark
fruits
cherry
grape
plum
strawberry
some
spices
corriander
clove
pepper
dark
candy
sugar
slightly
funky
belgian
yeast
minmal
floral
and
herbal
hops
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
and
the
carbonation
is
on
the
light
side
but
appropriate
and
drinkability
is
good
an
excellent
dubbel
i
dont
care
what
ba
says
complex
and
dare
i
say
better
than
the
one
brewed
in
cooperstown
also
an
incredible
value
musings
at
5
99
a
bottle
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
best
this
even
then
i
will
drink
this
over
allagash
and
put
alongside
unibroue
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
other
ommegang
brews
but
this
is
a
winner
pleasant
mouthfeel
with
a
great
carbonated
feel
and
a
smooth
body
body
is
medium
heavy
alcohol
resides
in
the
afterataste
warming
and
pleasant
on
a
cool
super
bowl
sunday
in
the
south
five
more
hours
until
kickoff
if
poured
like
the
bottle
says
you
get
a
good
inch
or
so
thick
head
that
lingers
around
for
a
minute
or
two
and
falls
back
on
itself
into
a
dense
top
layer
the
beer
is
a
redish
brown
smells
of
cherries
and
raisins
with
some
flowery
sweetness
tastes
like
fresh
cherries
and
raisins
crisp
sweetness
up
front
with
lots
of
yeast
and
a
yeastbreadmalt
finish
feels
like
you
just
got
done
chewing
through
some
fresh
bread
a
very
good
beer
to
say
the
least
lots
of
flavors
that
blend
well
the
beer
could
have
a
little
bit
less
yeast
but
other
than
that
nothing
bad
at
all
about
this
brew
i
could
drink
this
all
night
as
long
as
i
watched
myself
im
feeling
a
buzz
after
downing
this
first
bottle
now
i
look
forward
to
the
white
of
the
same
brand
thats
sitting
in
the
fridge
served
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
stein
i
know
i
should
be
using
a
goblet
its
a
good
looking
beer
a
nice
rich
brown
with
a
considerable
1
light
brown
not
quite
tan
head
plenty
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
nice
definite
fruit
prescence
taste
is
where
it
all
goes
wrong
its
very
yeasty
and
a
bit
nutty
if
there
was
fruit
in
there
the
yeast
overwhelmed
it
i
couldnt
even
taste
any
malt
or
hops
mouthfeel
was
smooth
enough
but
i
couldnt
make
detailed
observations
as
the
yeast
taste
was
rather
unpleasant
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
maybe
this
is
the
style
of
belgian
ales
im
not
familiar
with
belgian
style
so
i
couldnt
say
ive
got
chimay
red
for
the
super
bowl
and
hopefully
it
will
be
better
than
this
which
i
entirely
disliked
needless
to
say
i
didnt
finish
the
bottle
drinkability
extremely
enjoyable
and
flavorful
beer
that
should
be
on
everyones
regular
rotation
of
belgianstyle
ales
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
in
an
evening
very
enjoyable
brew
uncorked
a
chilled
15
bottle
750
ml
aroma
in
the
bottle
is
molasses
cherry
and
raisons
poured
it
into
a
goblet
glass
nice
tan
head
great
lacing
very
deep
copper
color
wafting
the
glass
produces
a
sweet
yet
very
tangy
smell
that
dislays
the
high
ac
of
this
beverage
the
carbonation
is
excellent
the
taste
is
sweet
yet
sour
cherry
accented
by
lemon
the
mouthful
is
explosion
of
flavors
and
carbonation
the
finish
is
sweet
yet
tangy
a
delicious
and
very
robust
selection
a
bottle
of
this
and
let
the
good
times
roll
i
definitley
will
be
restocking
this
brew
this
beer
emerged
out
of
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
with
a
dark
brown
colour
and
some
crimson
tint
where
the
light
struck
the
edges
of
the
glass
a
giganstrosity
of
a
tan
head
volcanoed
up
half
the
glass
requiring
a
wait
in
finishing
the
fill
the
nose
was
layered
with
some
bizarre
perfumed
flowery
scent
that
struck
me
at
the
onset
of
sniffing
after
this
oddity
was
nosed
scents
of
heavily
candied
dark
fruit
and
caramel
followed
on
its
heels
plum
and
black
cherry
notes
came
to
mind
the
nose
was
surprisingly
light
on
yeasty
character
although
some
was
present
within
the
quite
pronounced
and
rather
complex
mix
of
sugary
fruitiness
the
taste
held
a
sweet
aspect
at
the
front
end
that
later
tailed
into
some
dark
fruit
skin
like
dryness
from
the
hopping
it
is
always
interesting
to
taste
beers
like
these
so
much
to
consider
and
revel
in
the
tones
remind
me
of
light
caramel
and
old
super
ripe
plum
a
lingering
rind
quality
in
the
finish
keeps
the
dark
fruit
flavour
alive
as
the
tongue
is
dried
out
this
tastes
of
richness
and
maturity
in
terms
of
the
fruitiness
that
is
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
speedy
and
small
are
the
bubbles
that
contribute
to
this
lightness
the
drinkability
is
good
plenty
of
pondering
can
be
had
through
the
course
of
one
glass
though
not
enough
the
earth
may
not
shatter
but
there
are
certainly
good
tastes
and
food
for
thought
here
colour
is
dark
reddish
brown
or
plum
has
a
nice
oneinch
head
that
retains
itself
well
aromas
of
rasins
bananas
and
belgian
yeasts
are
present
sweet
and
mildly
alcoholic
the
first
taste
begins
fruity
and
becomes
sweet
after
a
few
seconds
the
sweet
malt
flavors
then
seem
to
evaporate
into
a
dry
and
spicy
alcoholic
finish
the
first
few
sips
were
excellent
but
over
time
the
spicyalcoholic
character
begins
to
overpower
the
complex
malt
flavors
making
it
harder
to
distinguish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
medium
thickness
and
robust
carbonation
i
like
the
beer
but
the
drinkablity
seems
to
decrease
for
me
as
i
go
along
supper
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
tan
head
smell
is
dark
fruit
plum
cherries
dates
also
a
slight
musty
yeasty
smell
taste
is
full
of
fruity
flavor
and
heavy
dark
malt
moutfeel
may
be
the
best
part
of
this
beer
very
creamy
full
mouth
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
active
on
the
tongue
the
best
american
belgian
style
beer
ive
had
this
is
one
i
will
return
to
over
and
over
this
is
an
interesting
beer
im
still
getting
acquainted
to
belgian
style
beers
so
i
dont
think
im
able
to
fully
appreciate
this
yet
now
i
want
to
find
out
what
an
authentic
belgian
version
tastes
like
d
pretty
good
considering
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pleasant
drink
although
id
call
it
a
dessert
beer
for
sure
i
really
enjoyed
it
even
though
it
tastes
strongly
of
alcohol
and
has
a
bit
of
an
odd
mouthfeel
poured
a
rich
deep
crimson
ale
with
an
off
white
rocky
head
that
left
ample
lace
and
stayed
around
for
a
long
time
the
aroma
is
rich
with
dark
caramel
maltyness
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
like
figs
the
flavor
is
excellent
and
has
become
my
personal
favorite
abbey
dubbel
as
it
begins
with
an
effervescent
rush
of
sweet
malt
and
perfectly
balanced
dark
fruit
which
slowly
fades
leaving
a
dry
and
clean
finish
which
becons
the
drinker
to
partake
of
another
sip
the
body
is
perfect
for
an
abbey
dubbel
and
it
is
both
full
of
carbonation
and
has
a
nice
weight
when
held
on
the
tongue
yet
has
a
very
clean
finish
this
ale
is
very
drinkable
and
i
will
probably
buy
a
few
bottles
to
lay
down
and
see
what
an
aged
example
tastes
like
finished
the
750ml
bottle
without
much
trouble
very
drinkable
for
an
8
beer
a
fine
american
belgian
style
ale
and
a
bargain
at
5
a
bottle
not
a
bad
ale
great
bargain
compared
to
chimay
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
row
however
the
physical
characteristics
of
this
beer
are
well
documented
in
other
reviews
so
i
will
merely
record
that
this
is
a
great
beer
and
while
i
cant
rule
out
the
possibility
that
there
will
be
those
who
dont
like
it
i
think
that
for
the
vast
majority
this
will
prove
to
be
a
repeat
purchase
item
quality
value
convenience
what
its
quite
strong
too
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
am
enjoying
but
isnt
a
classic
that
makes
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
poured
out
of
the
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
into
an
orval
chalice
gorgeous
brew
pours
a
bloodshot
brown
with
creamy
lingering
lacework
after
the
luxurious
head
so
appetizing
nose
is
fruity
and
sweet
sugar
isnt
hidden
at
all
also
notes
of
cherries
bananas
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
dominated
by
fruit
with
red
winelike
grape
notes
followed
by
yeasty
twang
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
unfortunately
the
mouthfeel
here
isnt
quite
right
which
i
think
detracts
from
the
complexity
of
the
taste
a
bit
too
light
and
watery
keeps
the
taste
from
lingering
long
after
the
swallow
the
only
real
flaw
with
this
brew
a
very
nice
and
affordable
belgian
like
others
have
said
ill
try
and
get
my
mitts
on
some
domestically
brewed
versions
and
see
if
the
texture
problem
is
worked
out
ommegang
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
can
easily
find
locally
and
thank
god
it
is
wonderful
stuff
pours

15
minutes

man
this
beer
just
gets
worse
as
i
drink
it
and
it
warms
sickly
sticky
sweet
not
sure
if
ill
finish
this
one
and
i
never
throw
beer
out
unless
its
spoiled
also
no
sign
of
head
now
and
zero
lacing
just
looks
like
a
flat
brown
unappealing
liquid
drinkability
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
the
sweetness
was
very
subdued
and
made
this
a
refreshing
ale
on
a
side
note
maybe
its
time
for
ommegang
to
start
bottling
some
wild
ale
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
when
i
naively
say
i
dont
like
belgian
beers
boozy
berries
and
dried
fruits
smothered
in
vanilla
with
undercurrents
of
anise
the
taste
is

the
taste
isnt
as
complex
and
having
tried
hundreds
of
other
beers
in
between
but
i
just
dont
like
it
much
it
leaves
a
medicine
like

i
will
probably
never
drink
this
beer
again

will
try

see
if
it
was

double
to
have
it
aged
in

so
far
i
think
it
was
a
treat
of
a
beer

its

such
a

makes

alcohol
and
a
slight

the
alcohol
is
apparent
but
not
overwhealming
this
is
a
nice
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasant
smooth
and
rich
a
full
flavored
and
bodied
beer
that
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
styles
this
beer
was
served
in
a
corked
bottle
i
delicately
poured
out
a
dark
brown
brew
that
had
reddish
undertones
a
nice
2
inch
sustained
fluffy
head
appeared
the
nose
was
spicy
and
fruity
perhaps
a
hint
of
cinanmon
thrown
in
taste
was
of
caramel
malts
that
are
perhaps
slightly
toasted
and
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
slight
dry
hop
finishes
the
taste
the
high
alcohol
content
is
well
balanced
and
disguised
there
is
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
to
this
brew
it
is
highly
carbonated
but
noy
overly
lively
on
the
palate
the
overall
drinkability
is
good
but
one
is
definitely
enough
in
one
sitting
this
would
be
a
good
brew
to
serve
during
the
holidays
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
at
a
classy
restaurant
while
everyone
else
sips
on
their
wine
definately
not
as
filling
as
i
had
expected
my
750ml
bottle
of
ommegang
was
corked
and
crowned
pours
a
cloudy
deep
redbrown
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
aroma
is
spicy
with
coriander
and
some
sour
fruit
taste
is
complex
sour
fruit
with
coriander
clove
and
maybe
some
light
banana
against
a
backdrop
of
yeasty
sourdough
malt
ommegang
is
lightly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
warmth
from
the
alcohol
on
the
way
down
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
very
affordable
as
well
the
big
bottle
can
be
had
for
3
50
in
my
area
drinkability
is
good
but
high
abv
makes
it
a
one
time
per
day
beer
additionally
the
3
philosophers
was
a
much
better
offering
from
this
brewery
this
was
the
last
bottle
from
a
case
purchased
a
year
ago
yet
there
is
no
dating
to
be
found
on
the
bottle
the
aromas
are
quite
sweet
with
loads
of
molasses
maple
syrup
cocoa
and
an
alcoholfueled
perfume
of
allspice
dark
brown
the
liquid
passes
unsweet
flavors
of
burned
sugar
licorice
beef
broth
and
acorns
to
the
mouth
charred
applewood
demerara
rum
boysenberry
and
smoked
pepper
images
all
can
be
teased
from
this
beautiful
drink
the
texture
is
hurried
by
alcohol
and
reveals
more
complex
structure
than
i
can
recall
from
this
brand
angular
rustic
and
filled
with
humid
botanical
fragrance
taste
of
malt
foreign
spices
sugars
and
belgian
speciality
yeast
honey
and
hints
of
plum
on
the
finish
a
rich
tasting
beer
that
is
complex
in
flavors
and
smooth
nice
one
great
flavors
and
good
drinkability
oelergud
da
yeh
its
a
good
purchase
ill
buy
it
again
beer
is
good
happy
beering
the
beer
is
a
deep
crimson
brown
in
color
the
head
is
about
2
fingers
high
that
falls
to
a
quarter
inch
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
somewhere
between
a
dark
caramel
and
the
fig
i
get
from
a
good
belgian
its
kind
of
enigmaic
for
me
the
flavor
is
not
quite
as
strong
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
the
malts
are
present
but
they
are
not
n
my
face
this
one
is
also
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
drinkability
is
high
but
i
think
this
is
at
a
sacrifice
from
the
other
aspects
of
this
beer
i
had
this
quite
a
while
back
and
i
was
suprised
to
see
that
i
hadnt
reviewed
it
i
had
it
again
and
what
a
wonderful
unique
brew
this
is
the
maltiest
belgianstyled
beer
i
can
remember
having
reminds
me
of
scottish
ale
with
the
sweet
bisquity
malt
backbone
a
nice
foamy
head
sits
atop
a
dark
ruby
brew
full
and
creamy
bursting
with
fruity
flavors
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
better
than
i
remember
and
once
again
quite
unique
overall
the
beer
is
very
spicy
and
warming
a
nice
apertif
definitely
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
2
the
taste
was
wonderful
it
was
well
carbonated
and
dry
with
apple
and
banana
flavors
mingled
with
a
light
spicy
hoppiness
a
very
good
beer
to
end
a
night
of
sampling
with
its
a
good
beer
but
the
spices
and
the
bubbly
mouthfeel
make
it
a
little
less
appealing
to
me
still
very
drinkable
just
not
something
i
would
probably
enjoy
often
still
at
three
and
a
half
bucks
for
750
ml
its
a
good
buy
for
a
good
beer
this
beer
poured
a
deep
deep
brown
with
a
1
inch
head
of
mostly
fine
grain
bubbles
there
was
a
delicate
lace
but
it
did
not
retain
the
nose
is
just
a
faint
hint
of
malt
i
didn¬ít
get
much
of
the
aroma
the
taste
has
just
a
hint
of
a
black
cherry
the
malt
but
this
beer
is
definitely
defined
by
the
malt
i
don¬ít
really
feel
or
taste
the
hops
at
all
it
has
a
mediumlight
mouth
feel
surprisingly
and
a
mediumhigh
drinkability
this
is
a
god
attempt
at
an
abbey
style
but
i¬íve
had

hue
with

honest
light
brown
head
malty
and
yeasty
nose
rich
of

overtones

which
is
not

to
a

noticeable

undistracting

with

high

not
as

as

luckily
pretty
good
but
i¬íve
yet
to
be
truly
impressed
by
a
dubbel
and
i
must
say
that
ommegang
has
never
impressed
me
all
that
much
besides
three
philosophers
drinkability
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
few
but
good
for
the
style
as
i
see
it
highly
recommended

a

brew
that
sneaks
up

you
i
dont

more
to

superb
great
i
want
more
a
nice
treat
for
the
palate
due
to
the

complex
flavors
but
not
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all

with

character
that
is
more
pleasant
than
it
sounds
goes
sort
of
medicinal
in
the
middle
with
a
phenolic
character
that
is
there
for
balnce
yet
seems
just
slightly
offkilter
finishes
with
a
peppery
noble
hop
bite
that
quite
satisfying
alcohol
stays
mostly
hidden
and
this
is
easy
drinkin
for
such
a
big
bold
and
flavorful
ale
one
of
the
best
americanbrewed
belgian
style
ales
that
ive
ever
had
made
even
more
attractive
at
its
price
relative
to
other
beers
of
this
style
and
character
nice
job
served
from

a

effect
gives

sweetness
that
carrys
itself
well
from

to
the

to

down
it

to
envelope
the
body
preparing
and
paving
the

up

of

pours
a
brownish
red
but
primarily
red
with
a
frothing
head
unfortunately
it
doesnt
stay
but
the
ring
around
the
glass
keeps
me
company
for
a
while
the
smell
is
well
i
kind
of
want
to
say
plums
or
raisins
but
i
cant
really
remember
what
they
smell
like
the
smell
is
caramelly
with
hints
of
spiced
fruit
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
winter
holiday
season
even
though
i
dont
celebrate
its
grassy
and
sweet
almost
like
holding
hands
with
your
girlfriend
while
lying
on
a
cool
autumn
lawn
during
twilight
the
taste
of
spiced
fruit
but
with
a
strong
spice
backbone
and
that
sweetness
that
gives
it
a
slightly
spicy
body
without
being
too
cloyingly
sweet
or
full
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
though
i
like
this
one
carbonation
is
light
and
defers
to
the
taste
i
should
get
this
in
smaller
bottles
or
find
someone
else
to
split
it
with
though
definitely
not
my
favorite
a
good
strong
beer
the
price
as
well
is
quite
nice
overall
a
bit
unbalanced
due
to
the
strong
pepper
and
spices
and
slightly
thin
mouthful
but
not
bad
begs
to
be
aged
after
all
of
the
promise
intrigue
of
the
nose
the
actual
taste
turns
out
to
be
a
bit
of
a
let
down
everything
promised
in
the
nose
is
there
but
the
whole
thing
seems
muted
dull
nothing
really
pops
i
am
at
least
digging
the
way
the
licorice
flavour
lingers
on
after
the
finish
brewery
ommegang
is
one
of
my
favs
for
sure
this
is
a
very
tasty
belgian
style
dark
ale
that
cost
less
than
many
similar
imports
it
can
also
be
found
in
4
packs
of
12oz
bottles
for
those
times
you
may
only
want
one
glass
of
beer
flawless
in
appearance
this
one
is
indeed
burgundian
with
a
soft
head
and
slightly
transparent
body
it
smells
and
tastes
very
fruity
but
the
taste
shows
a
little
more
alcohol
the
taste
combines
some
appleish
and
red
grape
flavors
that
linger
pleasantly
in
the
aftertaste
if
the
alcohol
was
hidden
a
bit
more
this
would
be
one
hell
of
a
beer
as
it
stands
it
is
very
good
and
one
that
im
sure
ill
return
to
dark
burgundian
in
color
with
a
voluminous
offwhite
head
smells
of
dark
fruits
rich
malts
some
hint
of
yeast
and
cocoa
taste
is
rich
and
full
and
of
chocolate
covered
dates
raisins
or
plums
lots
of
different
peppery
spices
fill
the
palate
and
there
is
a
dry
winelike
finish
medium
carbonation
fullmouthfeel
and
malt
texture
and
oh
so
smooth
and
drinkable
an
all
around
fantastic
brew
an
okay
beer
but
not
the
endall
for
belgian
darks
the
strong
nuttiness
on
the
finish
was
a
nice
surpise
but
the
alcohol
could
have
been
hidden
a
little
better

and
creamy
in
the
mouth
smooth

carbonation
just
floats
around

cant
believe
ive
never
taken
notes
on
it
a
thankfully
ubiquitous
brewery
my
only
problem
is
the
widely
varying
beer
this
can
become
depending
on
its
storage
each
bottle
has
been
too
ranging
from
the
previous
dark
somewhat
cloudy
slightly
ruby
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
floral
smells
almost
like
lavender
along
with
brown
sugar
and
apple
and
pear
banana
also
as
it
warms
fruity
and
complex
taste
the
brown
sugar
and
pears
plus
clove
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
cherries
come
through
slight
breadiness
on
occasion
as
well
as
some
pepper
a
little
figprune
taste
as
well
but
its
subtle
finishes
with
some
hops
and
bitter
fruit
flavors
thicker
side
of
medium
mouthfeel
with
more
carbonation
than
expected
id
like
fo
rthis
to
be
a
bit
drier
a
really
good
belgian
style
ale
ill
be
trying
some
more
from
this
brewery
ommegang
abbey
ale
is
a
pretty
fair
representation
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
and
is
a
quality
brew
if
thats
your
thing
it
isnt
mine
at
least
not
at
this
point
in
time
but
i
respect
this
beer
all
the
same
this
is
a
great
american
belgian
it
is
exceptionally
affordable
and
very
well
worth
every
penny
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
again
this
is
a
fine
effort
and
immenently
drinkable
if
not
entirely
true
to
style
it
is
so
tasty
that
the
minor
transgressions
on
tradition
are
easily
forgotton
dark
brown
pour
with
a
rich
tan
head
nice
liveliness
and
lacing
the
nose
mildly
sweet
with
hints
of
prune
and
fig
and
there
is
an
evident
pinch
of
spice
in
the
mix
as
well
the
taste
starts
lightly
earthy
and
build
up
towards
a
semi
sweetness
that
includes
dull
black
licorice
molasses
and
pruneraisin
on
the
finish
there
also
seems
to
be
a
tart
woodiness
that
creeps
in
ever
so
slightly
a
good
mouthfeel
that
is
lively
and
medium
bodied
a
subtle
version
of
a
strong
dark
belgian
that
does
a
good
job
in
remaining
well
balanced
without
being
over
the
top
a
nice
tan
tan
head
resting
over
an
dark
amber
body
aroma
is
strong
with
hints
of
alcohol
fruit
and
other
sweet
notes
taste
is
definately
full
flavored
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
i
sense
pepper
some
raisins
and
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thinner
than
its
cousin
hennepin
but
still
smooth
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
as
this
is
one
fatiguing
brew
good
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
easy
to
quaff
brewery
ommegang
really
did
a
fine
job
with
this
ale
this
easily
matches
its
peers
from
across
the
ocean
theyre
not
merely
aping
the
style
theyre
building
their
own
complexities
into
this
beer
a
great
effort
this
stuff
is
among
the
most
drinkable
stuff
on
earth
wow
that
is
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
when
you
pop
one
of
these
open
and
see
what
lies
ahead
wonderful
dark
brown
with
orange
hues
when
held
upto
the
light
the
aroma
is
full
with
sweet
malt
and
yeast
the
head
comes
up
strong
and
slowly
disolves
into
a
scattered
heavy
film
with
fairly
heavy
lacing
the
taste
is
very
dry
at
first
and
a
taste
of
raison
hits
the
tongue
chocolate
follows
with
a
nice
finish
there
is
definately
a
rough
texture
in
the
finish
though
overall
this
beats
many
from
belgium
and
is
a
wonderful
wonderful
beer
rich
and
full
of
malty
fruit
flavors
that
works
with
hearty
dishes
or
dessert
or
all
by
itself
pours
a
brown
body
that
turns
the
deepest
shade
of
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
with
a
light
leather
colored
head
and
some
splotches
of
lace
the
nose
first
picks
up
huge
notes
of
alcohol
that
drift
away
slowly
into
banannas
and
dark
malts
the
alcohol
maskes
a
lot
of
the
scents
taste
was
of
dark
fruitiness
creamy
mellow
smoothness
slight
chocolate
flavors
and
tons
of
warming
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
spritzy
and
highly
carbonated
until
the
yeast
is
added
then
it
gets
mellower
in
fact
the
whole
taste
gets
much
more
palateable
after
the
yeast
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
promise
but
falls
well
short
the
alcohol
dominates
the
nose
and
the
flavor
which
is
a
shame
because
this
could
be
a
great
beer
this
could
do
with
some
serious
aging
and
in
my
opinion
is
the
weakest
offering
of
ommegangs
cheers
to
the
belgians
it
pours
a
dark
carmel
with
tints
of
red
it
developed
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
settled
to
a
nice
film
the
smell
was
very
complex
with
multiple
fruits
including
raisan
apple
and
grape
with
some
spicieness
a
very
winey
taste
with
a
lot
of
complexity
there
is
a
good
maltieness
up
front
and
a
distinct
alcohol
taste
this
is
rounded
out
with
a
viariety
of
fruit
and
spice
flavors
there
are
traces
of
vanilla
and
a
twist
of
hop
in
the
finish
the
feel
is
smooth
and
oily
a
nice
fresh
alternative
to
the
imported
belgians
but
unlikely
to
supplant
them
my
biggest
problem
with
ommegang
is
that
i
find
it
to
be
a
statement
of
intent
it
goes
down
so
easily
that
a
person
could
drink
a
couple
750s
without
thinking
about
it
of
course
at
that
point
thinking
will
no
longer
be
an
issue
i
also
feel
that
there
is
a
certain
bias
against
domestic
¬ìbelgians¬î
but
i
would
urge
everyone
to
forgive
ommegang¬ís
domesticity
and
compare
it
directly
to
its
heritage
not
only
is
that
fair
but
i
think
any
belgian
fan
would
be
more
than
impressed
with
what
can
be
produced
in
the
states
notes
the
alcohol
is
very
present
in
this
beer
it
may
or
may
not
ruin
the
fruits
and
wheaty
tastes
it
depends
on
what
you
like
poured
out
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
mediumsized
even
head
sweet
caramel
aroma
with
some
estery
notes
sugary
malt
taste
followed
by
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
and
just
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
to
it
mouthfeel
is
at
once
mellow
and
refreshing
not
bad
stuff
fairly
complex
fruity
and
malty
with
a
good
head
and
good
blackish
color
nothing
here
that
absolutely
wowed
me
but
then
again
nothing
at
all
to
complain
about
either
i
liked
the
three
philosophers
a
bit
more
but
a
decent
showing
from
ommegang
at
3
99750ml
this
is
easily
the
best
belgian
bangforyourbuck
a
mahogany
body
with
a
moderatelysized
pale
tan
head
a
lot
of
yeast
and
alcohol
in
the
nose
the
taste
follows
up
in
much
the
same
manner
with
faint
notes
of
chocolate
and
cider
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
once
you
get
into
it
and
i
can
see
myself
buying
many
an
ommegang
750
in
the
future
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
and
i
am
glad
i
finally
tried
it
it
is
smooth
and
drinkable
complex
yet
easy
to
enjoy
and
not
overanalyze
i
have
been
hesitant
to
buy
this
i
dont
know
why
but
i
have
been
it
pours
a
very
deep
amber
colour
with
a
copper
tint
the
head
was
very
big
and
hass
lasted
a
while
the
scent
was
the
fruitiest
smell
i
have
ever
had
apples
berries
and
a
hint
of
lemon
make
up
the
aroma
the
taste
was
also
equally
as
fruity
it
has
an
apple
taste
along
with
kind
of
a
bready
taste
it
is
finished
by
a
wonderful
hoppy
bitterness
though
it
isnt
the
most
carbonated
beer
in
the
world
it
sure
felt
like
it
it
goes
down
sharply
i
dont
know
what
everyone
was
thinking
rating
this
beer
in
the
top
50
this
beer
is
almost
disgusting
pretty
bad
as
soon
as
i
opened
it
smell
is
fruity
but
full
of
alcohol
smelled
like
propane
with
mashed
figs
taste
was
far
worse
than
the
aroma
not
really
malt
and
hops
but
more
like
chemicals
and
raw
alcohol
i
tasted
sweetnlow
and
a
stong
artificial
tangyness
there
was
a
cherry
aftertaste
but
who
would
go
through
all
those
nasty
ass
flavors
just
to
get
to
the
aftertaste
i
cant
see
anyone
enjoying
this
beer
sure
this
beer
is
strong
and
will
put
you
on
your
ass
but
if
that¬ís
what
you
like
why
not
just
drink
bud
ice
instead
it
tastes
better
than
this
crap
the
only
good
thing
going
for
this
brew
is
its
appearance
dark
red
body
the
taste
might
make
you
guess
it
was
red
40
with
a
huge
tan
head
after
about
4
or
5
sips
i
couldnt
take
it
anymore
and
poured
the
rest
of
this
sickening
liquid
down
the
drain
just
a
superior
overall
product
great
value
too
sells
for
as
low
as
3
50
a
bottle
here
taste
is
definitely
on
par
with
other
beers
in
its
style
a
classic
strong
dark
ale
i
highly
recommend
this
oak
fruit
citrus
flavors
after
a
malty
alcohol
fruity
smell
drinking
this
after
half
a
glass
of
old
horizontal
and
it
definitely
has
some
of
the
strength
of
oh
with
more
of
a
wine
like
taste
that
was
very
interesting
alcohol
presence
was
very
evident
extremely
dry
finish
that
was
very
nice
for
the
high
abv
a
sippable
drinkable
offering
different
brew
with
interesting
qualities
drinkability
reminiscent
of
chimay
blue
but
with
rougher
edges
perhaps
reflected
in
the
lower
price
point
a
750
presents
no
problems
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
amazingly
complex
fruity
and
bitter
amazing
hops
most
complex
beer
i
have
had
well
at
least
in
the
top
five
a
malty
complex
carbohydrate
sweetness
this
is
the
ultimate
belgian
big
malt
refined
sweetness
intellegent
use
of
hops
balanced
yet
big
i
love
it
this
beer
has
a
dense
and
rich
moutfeel
but
is
very
drinkable
altogether
a
quality
product
the
taste
orange
cherries
apricot
plums
every
once
in
awhile
i
got
a
slight
sweet
maltyvinegar
taste
complex
and
delicious
after
continuing
to
drink
i
started
to
notice
the
delcious
oily
mouthfeel
and
kept
drinking
more
its
8
5
abv
but
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
long
and
be
quite
happy
pours
with
a
light
brown
head
atop
a
hazy
amber
colored
beer
the
head
is
quite
thick
the
aroma
at
first
i
detect
raisin
and
a
bit
of
rum
then
i
get
some
subdued
notes
of
sherry
the
taste
is
a
bit
spicy
with
some
light
sherry
notes
to
it
this
beer
has
a
fairly
good
amount
of
body
to
it
as
well
the
finish
is
slightly
on
the
hot
side
spicy
this
aged
example
tastes
meaty
this
would
go
well
with
a
red
meat
dish
i
enjoy
the
belgian
brews
and
i
heard
this
american
take
on
it
was
very
nice
so
i
gave
it
shot
paid
only
4
89
for
the
750ml
bottle
chilled
it
until
dinner
and
poured
into
a
wide
mouth
glass
dark
brown
with
a
frothy
tan
head
great
lacing
as
the
head
settled
smelled
very
much
of
the
belgian
style
with
fruity
tones
over
a
nice
roasted
malt
aroma
tasted
excellent
very
fruity
spices
mixed
well
in
this
8
5
abv
so
it
warms
the
soul
quickly
an
excellent
american
take
on
the
abbey
style
ale
try
it
out
poured
a
hazy
rich
brown
with
a
good
sized
tan
head
that
retained
fairly
well
and
developed
into
a
thin
film
over
the
beer
aroma
of
rich
fruits
deep
malts
and
alcohol
taste
was
of
sweet
raisins
caramel
and
molasses
a
dark
liquor
consistency
with
a
slightly
dry
malty
finish
i
had
two
in
a
row
and
i
would
say
thats
the
limit
for
me
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
an
american
beer
i
truly
fell
in
love
with
the
belgian
abbey
style
after
this
beer
a
definately
eye
opener
and
an
exceptional
ale
very
complex
and
big
lots
of
chewy
mouthfeel
and
texture
with
this
one
at
my
wegmans
grocery
store
this
stuff
is
a
steal
about
4
25
for
a
25
oz
bottle
same
for
ommegangs
two
other
brews
id
better
buy
a
bunch
of
them
before
they
hike
up
the
price
for
session
drinking
or
everyday
meals
i
like
hennepin
and
rare
vos
better
but
this
is
great
with
a
special
occasion
meal
at
the
brewery
they
gave
us
some
semisweet
chocolate
with
it
that
really
enhanced
the
flavors
and
it
works
very
well
with
nottoosweet
desserts
a
cheese
plate
or
fruit
and
biscotti
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
amber
color
and
formed
a
medum
full
tan
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
spices
the
flavor
has
elements
of
malt
citrus
and
spices
the
finish
is
a
bit
bittersweet
with
some
astigency
no
a
bad
beer
3
99
for
750ml
much
more
of
a
winner
than
id
believed
fairly
cheap
too
this
will
regain
a
spot
in
my
rotation
this
beer
has
become
my
standby
for
the
dark
belgian
style
of
beer
brewed
in
new
york
the
price
is
half
that
of
my
favorite
imports
in
the
same
style
and
the
flavor
is
fully
their
equal
750
ml
bottle
no
date
on
bottle
surprisingly
i
seemed
to
detect
more
in
the
nose
before
pouring
the
yeast
in
i
initially
picked
up
grapes
peaches
coriander
and
alcohol
after
pouring
the
yeast
they
are
less
noticeable
and
a
more
spicy
clove
aroma
is
present
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
settle
as
well
post
yeast
and
is
less
carbonated
and
has
less
of
a
bite
to
it
flavor
has
a
good
deal
of
spices
in
addition
to
some
strong
grapewiney
notes
slightly
fruity
middle
finishes
dry
with
a
mild
alcohol
taste
update
¬ñ
after
having
a
few
of
these
over
the
last
year
i
decided
to
rereview
it
for
2004
i
seem
to
have
gotten
used
to
the
light
licorice
flavor
at
the
finish
of
this
ale
so
upped
the
¬ìdrinkability¬î
rating
from
4
0
to
4
5
poured
a
deep
dark
rootbeer
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
retained
at
a
small
film
aroma
is
strong
and
of
sweet
dark
fruit
caramel
and
alcohol
along
with
some
typical
belgian
characteristics
while
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
it
was
toned
down
a
little
in
the
flavor
taste
was
also
very
much
like
molasses
along
with
maple
prunes
and
malt
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
i
did
like
this
but
prefer
the
hennepin
as
this
one
is
not
as
light
and
drinkable
as
the
henne
all
in
all
this
brew
is
a
wonderful
example
of
this
style
as
all
ommegang
brews
tend
to
be
this
and
unibroue
trois
pistoles
are
currently
two
of
my
favorite
belgian
styled
dark
ales
very
nice
very
complex
flavors
here
impressive
indeed
a
slight
sour
pervades
through
a
gamut
malts
malted
to
the
hilt
all
around
strawberry
and
a
slight
hint
of
sugar
with
a
wonderful
wild
cherry
tart
and
earthy
malt
go
to
war
but
its
not
overplayed
in
fact
its
fun
to
witness
only
a
bit
of
spices
and
they
are
welcome
theres
actually
a
green
veggy
taste
on
the
finish
its
cucumber
and
some
bitter
herbs
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
heavy
chewy
although
i
liked
it
alot
i
wouldnt
term
it
as
super
drinkable
by
any
means
its
specialized
i
would
have
preferred
this
beer
if
it
had
a
little
more
carbonation
it
had
a
flat
appearance
and
taste
overall
though
it
is
a
thoroughly
drinkable
beer
but
not
quite
the
effort
of
ommegangs
hennipen
ale
while
the
head
dissapears
rather
quickly
the
beautiful
ruby
glow
of
the
liquid
more
than
makes
up
for
it
the
taste
is
mellow
alcoholic
and
a
bit
malty
it
may
take
half
a
bottle
but
after
a
while
you
can
feel
the
beer
dance
along
your
tongue
slide
down
your
throat
and
warm
your
belly
i
had
the
750
ml
cork
version
of
this
beer
it
poured
nice
and
thick
good
strong
head
with
plenty
of
flavor
when
it
settled
it
had
a
nice
brownred
color
with
a
medium
to
thick
body
the
aroma
was
a
little
spicy
but
not
over
the
top
a
good
strong
taste
of
sweet
carmel
and
spicy
fruit
nice
dry
finish
not
to
whiny
dark
brown
beer
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
sticky
belgian
lace
prune
rum
and
yeast
notes
were
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
very
malty
with
some
spiciness
and
rum
notes
had
a
very
heavy
mouth
but
wasnt
chewy
definitely
a
big
beer
this
is
about
the
best
looking
beer
i
have
seen
dark
brown
with
a
nice
long
lasting
creamy
colored
head
i
have
a
cold
but
i
can
smell
fruit
malt
and
raisons
the
taste
is
one
of
a
kind
smokey
hit
of
cherryi
think
cocoa
with
fruit
in
the
background
the
cocoa
sticks
around
after
you
are
done
drinking
this
i
did
not
notice
any
alchohol
i
bet
i
will
by
the
time
i
drink
this
big
bottle
cheers
a
very
bold
strong
belgian
ale
extremely
authentic
the
sweetness
along
with
the
alcohol
gets
to
be
a
little
too
much
and
one
or
two
glasses
is
all
i
can
take
in
a
sitting
the
price
is
also
impossible
to
beat
especially
for
the
quality
of
the
product
if
all
the
disgusting
aspects
of
robitussin
could
be
removed
and
replaced
with
tasty
beer
this
is
what
youd
take
for
a
cough
as
it
stands
it
cuts
through
a
stress
headache
quite
nicely
this
beer
smells
great
get
a
good
bit
of
alcohol
smell
but
is
blended
into
a
bunch
of
other
scents
as
well
im
definately
getting
an
intense
raisin
smell
and
some
other
stuff
too
that
i
cant
quite
pick
out
the
taste
however
isnt
outstanding
its
good
dont
get
me
wrong
with
some
of
the
same
raisin
notes
and
a
little
sourness
but
it
is
nothing
better
than
a
corsendonk
i
guess
that
isnt
much
of
an
insult
but
after
the
hennepin
i
was
expecting
more
from
their
beefier
beer
very
full
mouthfeel
almost
chewy
very
delicious

signature

the

smooth
taste
despite
8
5
alcohol
nice
beer
this
was
my
first
brew
from
ommegang
and
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
the
style
is
usually
a
bit
winey
but
in
this
case
is
was
less
so
in
palate
but
had
a
burghandy
nose
color
but
with
a
very
thin
head
the
finish
was
quite
lingering
and
moved
from
a
slight
prune
sweetness
to
a
dryer
finish
this
a
nice
style
that
is
well
captured
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
rather
strong
alcohol
content
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
not
one
id
sit
around
drinking
on
a
routine
basis
probably
best
to
have
with
a
good
meal
john
ng
overall
a
pretty
big
and
bold
beer
exceptionally
well
crafted
after
finishing
my
first
glass
i
got
a
real
desire
for
some
fries
with
mayonnaise
sauce
so
into
the
oven
they
went
and
out
came
the
evan
williams
bourbon
a
bit
of
bourbon
mixed
with
mayo
monks
cafe
style
that
second
glass
of
ommegang
and
those
french
fries
with
bourbon
mayo
and
i
was
loving
life
now
thats
a
good
pairing
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
light
tan
head
there
is
a
minimal
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
sweet
slightly
toasted
malt
and
alcohol
very
rich
and
powerful
aroma
the
taste
is
heavy
with
malt
ripe
plums
and
raisins
and
a
touch
of
hops
it
has
a
sweet
dry
finish
almost
winelike
the
mouthfeel
is
very
strong
and
heavy
the
drinkability
is
average
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
a
good
beer
to
be
slowly
sipped
amongst
the
driest
belgianstyle
brews
that
ive
had
and
though
i
prefer
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
my
beer
this
certainly
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
something
thats
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste
around
this
time
one
year
ago
i
was
living
in
socal
and
trying
different
beers
this
is
probably
the
first
dark
belgium
style
strong
ale
i
tried
but
at
the
time
i
had
no
idead
what
i
had
in
my
grasps
its
been
a
great
time
enjoying
and
experiencing
all
of
the
beers
i
have
sampled
but
it
sure
is
nice
to
revisit
this
amazingly
true
to
its
country
of
origin
ommegang
ale
appears
mahogany
brown
with
amber
hazed
hues
shimmering
through
matched
by
a
creamy
tan
effervescent
massive
head
coating
my
goblet
with
trickled
lace
very
nicely
some
true
eye
candy
in
my
hand
here
aromatics
are
this
beers
forte
fortified
with
robust
brown
sugar
coated
simmered
fruit
namingly
plums
a
rolling
malt
sweetness
so
gentle
and
perfect
this
beer
is
other
aroma
evident
are
the
slight
hop
aroma
delicate
and
light
but
evident
along
with
trace
of
alcohol
notes
to
finish
off
the
smell
taste
is
just
as
easily
a
winter
warmer
as
a
summer
sipper
wellmade
and
meaty
this
beer
is
packed
wtih
taste
slightly
nutty
quality
with
cream
laced
fruit
massive
complex
tones
so
good
you
just
have
to
try
it
for
yourself
my
my
hey
hey
belgium
style
beer
is
better
to
drink
than
to
piss
away
i
dont
know
what
that
was
but
what
i
meant
is
this
an
amazing
example
of
what
the
american
craft
brewing
seen
is
capable
of
it
speaks
volumes
on
so
many
levels
of
brewing
textured
with
silky
smooth
qualities
and
a
full
medium
body
astonishing
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
grade
a
as
far
as
after
i
finish
this
beer
i
indefinitely
want
another
taste
of
it
25
6
oz
is
enough
for
anyone
especially
8
5
percent
by
volume
however
this
beer
is
to
be
enjoyed
and
paired
with
great
food
deep
burgundy
hue
with
a
trifling
murk
covered
by
a
beige
thick
steadfast
head
exiguous
wandering
near
lace
remains
the
aroma
is
a
delicate
amiable
melange
of
stately
barely
ripe
banana
rich
nutty
carob
and
mild
herbal
phenols
after
a
deliberation
breezy
wafts
of
semisweet
cocoa
dusted
fermented
prune
provide
a
lightly
sugared
fruity
contrast
mellow
rounded
dark
toffee
sweetness
incipient
in
flavor
is
ensued
and
complemented
by
a
persistent
fruit
driven
combination
of
fructose
rich
raisin
and
tracely
tart
underripe
plum
as
the
beer
breathes
judicious
cocoa
and
a
subtle
earthy
hop
presence
emerge
facilitating
an
agreeable
bittersweet
contrast
to
the
residual
sweetness
dark
fruit
character
fades
late
but
banana
esters
remain
constant
and
couple
with
the
light
but
perceptibly
grainy
bready
malt
undertone
to
facilitate
a
chocolate
tinged
banana
bread
impression
after
the
brief
initial
carbonic
acid
bite
dissipates
the
mouthfeel
becomes
invariably
lightly
viscous
and
pleasantly
dextrinous
finishes
with
a
brusque
snap
of
clove
phenol
that
yields
to
fleeting
hints
of
sweet
british
digestive
biscuits
the
cellaring
has
completely
assuaged
the
light
but
perceptibly
phenolic
edge
of
regular
ommegang
which
was
already
a
fine
brew
chocolate
character
has
augmented
slightly
while
the
dark
fruity
esters
have
diminished
the
end
result
is
a
superbly
balanced
dubbel
esque
brew
with
superlative
drinkabilty
its
affably
soft
on
the
palate
and
certainly
delicious
i
wish
to
sincerely
thank
feloniousmonk
for
delivering
bottle
214
to
me
caramely
brown
with
amber
highlights
and
a
monstrous
fluffy
head
not
surprisingly
the
abundant
head
makes
for
a
rich
nose
with
fruit
notes
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
all
readily
detectable
reminiscent
of
some
red
wines
ive
had
very
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
is
offset
by
a
lightness
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
roof
of
the
mouth
sweet
full
malt
base
slowly
melts
away
to
leave
a
light
crispness
and
in
the
end
the
warmth
of
alcohol
the
scent
and
taste
of
alcohol
seemed
to
increase
as
the
beer
warm
or
as
i
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
other
flavors
it
had
a
strong
flavor
to
it
even
though
it
had
a
light
body
dark
fruits
were
noticed
dates
raisins
prunes
along
with
a
light
honey
taste
further
along
i
detected
a
woody
presence
in
the
beer
the
finish
reminds
me
of
a
red
wine
along
with
oak
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
but
if
you
have
the
money
i
would
recommend
getting
a
true
belgian
i
e
beer
from
belgium
a
decent
rush
of
carbonation
greets
the
opener
perhaps
surprisingly
then
this
brownishred
murky
beer
forms
only
a
mediumsized
head
that
dissipates
quickly
stirring
the
beer
brings
about
a
ressurection
of
foam
and
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
chocolate
covered
raisins
and
spices
in
the
aroma
with
an
tinge
alcohol
that
presents
itself
more
as
the
beverage
warms
flavors
are
deep
rich
and
fruity
ripened
plums
and
raisins
leading
to
a
an
unripe
plumskin
bitterness
despite
the
obvious
fruity
flavors
this
beer
is
hardly
as
sweet
as
some
other
abbey
style
ales
it
has
a
slightly
stronger
body
a
little
bit
more
of
a
grainy
base
very
drinkable
brew
hides
its
abv
well
deep
hazy
caramel
color
with
a
light
brown
head
of
small
tight
bubbles
the
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
is
light
a
bit
malty
and
a
bit
fruity
like
pear
but
also
has
a
slight
alcoholic
smell
that
almost
seems
metallic
taste
is
big
and
rich
heavy
malt
with
yeasty
highlights
and
a
bit
of
hops
and
fruit
a
hop
bitter
and
malt
sweetness
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
throat
a
metallic
alcohol
undertone
matches
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
a
very
tasty
beer
that
would
be
more
drinkable
for
me
if
the
metallic
notes
could
be
reduced
thanks
to
linc
again
for
this
one
to
quote
a
friend
the
aroma
was
of
whiteboard
markers
there
was
also
a
bit
of
fuel
raw
alcohol
and
caramel
in
the
aroma
the
palate
is
caramelly
and
candied
with
some
raw
alcohol
in
the
finish
a
bit
rough
and
short
it
didnt
really
taste
belgian
to
me
either
not
bad
palate
is
a
bit
too
sticky
or
something
the
beer
pours
a
dark
burgandy
just
as
the
label
states
the
head
thick
and
full
is
a
dark
whitetan
color
its
quite
hazy
but
no
bother
the
aroma
is
good
it
smells
of
liquorice
corriander
and
ginger
the
flavor
is
rich
and
powerful
the
8
5
abv
is
evident
as
it
slips
down
your
throat
its
a
great
beer
again
it
is
good
with
gourmet
dishes
great
beer
derserves
great
food
as
they
proclaim
on
the
bottle
the
star
anise
shines
through
on
the
taste
buds
its
spicy
but
calm
with
its
darkness
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
what
do
you
expect
dark
beer
bottle
conditioned
spices
it
is
plenty
drinkable
but
i
would
advise
not
to
drink
too
much
you
might
just
end
up
passed
out
early
i
gave
this
one
the
respectable
slow
pour
a
belgian
style
dubble
deserves
2
creamy
white
head
diminished
to
a
rim
and
fine
lacing
within
5
minutes
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
small
traces
of
light
through
the
glass
sweet
smell
of
ripe
cherrys
which
becomes
perfumelike
as
you
sip
taste
is
also
sweet
ripe
cherries
with
a
mild
apple
core
aftertaste
not
at
all
unpleasant
there
is
a
medium
body
and
very
smooth
mouth
feel
which
bring
increase
its
drinkability
already
my
favorite
domestic
belgian
i
am
very
partial
to
belgian
style
ales
and
this
domestic
brew
makes
me
fall
in
love
all
over
again
sweet
smooth
and
very
drinkable
despite
a
8
5
abv
the
way
a
belgian
should
be
f
the
cave
did
its
work
well
this
is
one
kick
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
perhaps
the
second
best
american
execution
of
the
style
after
the
allagash
with
any
luck
well
be
able
to
start
getting
it
out
here
on
a
regular
basis
the
color
was
a
nice
dark
maroon
color
with
a
fruity
smell
not
bad
the
taste
was
not
my
type
though
it
was
a
heavy
beer
with
almost
a
sweet
taste
almost
like
a
chocolate
the
aftertaste
was
very
smooth
and
dry
but
again
the
type
of
beer
is
not
my
type
those
who
like
the
style
will
enjoy
this
hearty
brew
have
a
few
of
all
brewery
ommegand
offerings
and
this
is
a
good
one
it
had
a
nice
caramel
color
and
a
nice
head
of
fine
bubles
that
disipates
reasonably
slow
it
has
a
a
dry
quality
in
the
middle
and
sweetness
all
around
the
most
stand
out
taste
for
me
was
of
pruines
and
gave
it
a
nice
rich
mouthfeel
this
one
is
a
great
deal
for
5
i
would
try
the
hennepin
if
you
like
this
one
i
think
it
is
their
best
offering
it
was
damn
good
and
left
me
wanting
another
once
i
had
finished
the
750ml
bottle
originally
sampled
on
23
january
2002
this
beer
is
chocolate
brown
in
color
w
a
light
foamy
head
the
taste
is
sweet
yet
tart
w
a
very
clean
finish
a
very
unique
beer
well
worth
the
price
ommegang
is
a
very
nice
american
version
of
a
belgian
ale
simply
phenomenal
if
this
is
what
i
have
to
look
forward
to
from
the
belgian
brews
then
i
am
rushing
to
them
is
this
the
finest
american
brew
there
is
a
great
beer
and
an
amazing
value
at
3
50
for
a
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
semiopaque
reddishbrown
with
a
nice
fluffy
sticky
beige
head
very
potent
smells
and
tastes
of
fruit
apples
raisins
dangerously
good
i
just
had
a
whole
bottle
to
myself
and
i
dont
particularly
feel
like
moving
poured
a
hazy
ruby
brown
with
a
cream
thick
brown
head
aroma
of
yeast
dark
fruit
alcohol
and
a
sweetness
head
flavor
was
slightly
tart
and
yeasty
alcohol
comes
across
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
belgian
yeast
and
dark
fruit
are
most
notable
on
the
tongue
a
slight
sweetness
and
lingering
tartness
are
also
present
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
am
happy
to
have
available
in
the
seattle
area
this
dark
ale
kicked
my
butt
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
ommegang
is
one
of
the
great
us
interpretations
of
a
great
belgian
style
ale
a
wonderful
beer
smells
fantastic
with
lots
of
fruit
and
malt
tones
mostly
citrus
with
some
melon
grape
raisin
and
fig
all
dancing
around
with
a
super
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
thats
soft
and
subtle
taste
is
pretty
much
in
your
face
with
a
whole
lotta
of
malt
thats
sweet
and
lends
into
the
the
tropical
feel
and
taste
of
melon
and
some
citrusy
bitterness
and
vanilla
feel
is
medium
bodied
silky
smooth
with
a
huge
bitterness
in
the
end
that
really
soured
to
much
for
me
it
started
nice
but
i
think
perhaps
a
little
more
aging
would
calm
the
bittery
end
down
some
not
bad
at
all
pretty
drinkable
is
darn
good
and
sip
worthy
as
it
warms
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
style
everything
exist
in
harmonious
bliss
what
can
i
say
but¬Öwow
pours
a
beautiful
rubygarnet
red
with
a
decent
sized
creamy
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
wonderful
aroma
of
plums
and
cherries
came
across
with
hints
of
sweet
caramel
had
a
very
nice
taste
which
complemented
the
smell
quiet
well
the
alcohol
seemed
to
send
a
burst
of
warmth
through
my
throat
and
stomach
a
sweet
aftertaste
of
plums
left
me
wanting
more
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
style
beer
and
very
affordable
for
those
of
us
on
a
seemingly
tight
budget
fruits
are
dominant
but
they
are
not
alone
the
darks
malts
are
blended
in
very
well
and
the
pale
malts
also
add
a
great
character
to
the
beer
i
get
a
strong
taste
of
celestial
seasons
wild
cherry
berry
tea
with
a
bit
of
sugar
in

is
in
perfect
balance
and
it
keeps
it
under
control
this
brweis
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
and
many
at
a
house
party
would
not
be
upset
by
this
brew
now
this
is
a
good
ale
the
750
ml
corked
bottle
has
a
classy
label
and
the
ale
pours
with
a
sparkling
deep
red
color
and
a
modest
dark
tan
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
complex
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
spice
licorice
and
the
glass
has
a
lively
dance
of
bubbles
that
keep
popping
away
throughout
this
carbonation
is
immediately
noticeable
in
the
mouth
but
the
taste
is
excellent
the
initial
tang
mellows
pleasantly
and
there
is
just
a
little
hint
of
the
high
alcohol
content

im
rapidly
becoming
a
convert
to
these
belgianstyle
ales
not
all
that
expensive
and
well
worth
it
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
and
fruity
and
good
the
body
itself
is
quite
large
which
is
somewhat
masked
by
the
fruity
smell
its
quite
filling
so
im
glad
i
didnt
purchase
the
large
bottle
this
is
a
treat
and
should
be
served
as
desert
or
as
a
way
to
surprise
your
wine

almost
my

0
this
should
be
sipped
but
its
not
lasting
very
long
in
my
glass
i
dint
think
id
like
this
one
that
much
but
i
am
impressed
worthy
of
its
highly
esteemed
reputation
over
an
hour
later
i
can
still
taste
it
in
my
mouth
but
i
do
not
revel
in
the
lingering
taste
i
wish
sincerely
that
i
loved
this
beer
but
when
i
drank
it
i
felt
like
a
tonedeaf
person
at
the
symphony
i
want
to
dance
with
my
beer
not
fight
with
it
its
the
beer
version
of
a
broadshouldered
red
zinfandel
wine
or
one
of
those
fillingrattling
cabernet
sauvignons
my
senses
were
definitely
engaged
but
they
did
not
like
it
too
sharp
too
harsh
too
peppery
i
am
impressed
this
is
one
good
beer
i
was
never
a
fan
of
belgian
styles
but
tried
this
one
anyway
nice
red
color
with
a
fair
bit
of
head
that
rapidly
fades
to
a
thin
nut
persistant
layer
with
no
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
with
alcohol
obvious
taste
mimics
aroma
vinous
and
strong
i
think
ill
give
this
style
a
second
look
and
this
beer
several
more
the
front
is
spice
and
apples
the
middle
is
just
a
little
sour
with
malt
and
more
apples
the
alcohol
shows
up
a
little
in
the
dry
bitter
spicy
finish
it
feels
a
little
thin
but
its
a
good
interesting
beer
thats
very
drinkable

and
powerful
even
a

the

has
some

to
it
also
some

quite
a

of
all
things

what
a
beer
for
the
price
im
a
broke
college
student
and
i
can
afford
a
yummy
belgian
style
this
is
most
highly
recommended
i
had
this
with
dinner
and
chocolates
and
a
couple
of
things
should
be
noted
do
not
have
this
with
spicy
foods
it
really
intensifies
the
spices
do
accompany
this
with
chocolates
as
it
complements
the
flavors
quite
well
real
nice
burgundy
in
color
with
a
great
headwith
nice
belgian
lace
left
there
somewhat
medicinal
in
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
showing
up
there
taste
was
sweet
the
some

in
there
as
well
incredible

alcohol
showed
up
fast
as

became
stronger
as
it
warmedabout
as
authentic
as
you
can
getthe
know
what
they
are
doing
up
there
in
cooperstown
ive
had
this
beer
in
the
12
oz
bottle
as
well
as
this
larger
size
although
i
didnt
take
any
notes
of
my
prior
tasting
this
beer
seems
to
be
slightly
more
powerful
in
the
larger
bottle
with
a
dryer
finish
excellent
overall
though
no
matter
the
container
too
much
fizz
looks
and
feels
like
7up
with
corn
syrup
nice
and
dark
but
doesnt
make
up
for
the
poor
head
tastes
pretty
good
but
im
definitely
done
after
having
one
no
desire
to
pop
another
one
right
away
sad
that
the
brewery
making
hennepin
considers
this
their
namesake
beer
drinkability
this
stuff
is
like
nectar
from
the
gods
but
the
8
5
abv
makes
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
a
rather
bad
decision
750
ml
corked
caged
bottle
the
cork
almost
pops
out
on
its
own
minimal
effort
needed
there
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
tinges
with
a
full
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
carbonation
fed
layer
after
a
couple
of
minutes
aroma
is
very
vinous
alcohol
fruit
on
the
nose
smell
of
red
wine
taste
is
very
much
in
line
with
the
nose
vinous
astringent
and
pruny
with
a
grapefruit
bitterness
mouthfell
is
slightly
sticky
carbonation
is
appropriate
for
the
style
although
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
i
wouldnt
rate
this
one
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
not
for
me
anyway
ill
go
for
the
hennepin
again
before
this
one
update
after
a
few
protests
from
people
ive
decided
to
try
this
brew
again
this
time
from
a
known
fresh
12
oz
bottle
the
head
was
not
a
problem
on
this
pour
making
me
think
that
my
last
bottle
was
contaminated
that
was
until
i
tasted
it
i
still
stand
by
my
original
review
i
think
this
beer
is
horrible
yet
i
will
make
a
few
additions
1the
aroma
i
notice
this
time
around
that
there
is
a
strong
tang
of
toffee
and
dark
candi
sugar
though
i
dont
think
it
is
brewed
with
it
2there
is
a
huge
pepper
note
on
top
of
the
potent
fusels
3the
lace
is
nonexistant
so
im
going
to
take
another
0
5
points
off
for
looks
4the
bittering
hops
are
rubbery
and
earthy
5it
took
me
20
minutes
to
get
about
6
oz
of
this
down
and
i
already
have
a
mean
headache
ugh
this
beer
really
chaps
my
ass
down
the
sink
it
goes
750
ml
bottle
oh
so
very
good
burgundy
in
color
with
a
nice
and
plentiful
white
head
fruity
with
what
seems
to
be
raisins
prunes
extremely
complex
and
extremely
good
alcoholic
tasting
definitely
one
that
you
have
to
respect
extremely
reasonable
price
4
50
for
a
750
ml
bottle
i
drank
the
entire
bottle
and
would
gladly
return
to
it
again
burgundy
in
color
with
a
light
brown
head
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aromas
i
get
are
of
alcohol
orange
peel
sweet
caramel
maltiness
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
flavor
is
spicy
and
medicinal
it
has
a
candi
sugar
sweetness
and
fruity
fig
or
date
flavors
it
is
medium
in
body
alcoholic
with
a
dry
finish
overall
a
very
complex
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
i
am
a
reliable
consumer
of
ommegangs
beer
theyre
local
the
price
is
right
the
love
is
in
the
beer
and
its
fresh
im
not
one
for
all
the
plummy
oakytype
descriptors
but
i
agree
with
the
bas
description
of
cloves
and
citrus
for
the
ommegang
otherwise
i
just
think
of
beer
flavors
and
whether
the
beer
is
balanced
and
multidimensional
this
beer
definitely
has
strength
a
malty
mouthful
of
flavor
and
character
a
good
winter
beer
to
drink
slowly
and
savor
i
usually
pour
a
couple
mouthfuls
at
a
time
from
a
liberal
height
to
set
the
head
off
nice
and
this
beer
holds
it
nice
and
the
gas
in
the
beer
makes
it
nice
and
creamy
an
excellent
blend
of
texture
assertiveness
and
flavor
gotta
do
these
guys
the
justice
of
buying
a
belgian
glass
cheers
pours
a
rich
burgundy
with
a
light
fruity
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
grapes
malt
and
a
small
woody
hop
finish
this
strong
ale
reminded
me
of
a
fruit
wine
without
any
of
the
offtaste
i
find
in
most
barley
wines
im
glad
a
belgian
of
this
quality
is
being
made
in
the
us
i
would
love
to
try
the
cave
aged
version
of
this
i
think
that
it
would
take
away
some
of
the
more
jagged
edges
not
that
there
are
that
many
i
am
not
a
huge
dubbel
fan
but
this
one
is
nice
the
burgandy
reference
in
the
description
is
what
caught
my
eye
this
was
a
promise
i
wanted
to
see
furfilled
i
was
not
dissapointed
very
fruitiful
with
great
wine
like
qualities
the
name
is
alittle
hard
on
the
tongue
but
everything
else
is
easy
on
the
pallette
i
love
the
pop
of
a
cork
slow
not
vigorous
pour
into
my
nbb
snifter
the
color
was
a
brilliant
ruby
red
much
like
cranberry
juice
with
a
nice
thick
small
bubble
head
of
light
tan
bought
12
inch
thick
which
slowly
disipated
as
i
drank
the
aroma
of
sourgrapes
and
sweet
malt
burst
through
the
rim
slightly
winey
taste
to
it
grape
and
banana
fruit
spicy
kick
it
was
medium
bodied
with
no
long
after
taste
just
a
slight
sour
note
all
in
all
pretty
good
little
too
sour
to
drink
more
than
one
750
high
carbonation
and
dry
finish
well
the
original
ommegang
is
quite
a
good
dubbel
on
its
own
right
so
when
i
visited
the
brewery
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
cave
aged
ommegang
supposedly
they
cave
aged
1716
bottles
in
howe
caverns
but
my
bottle
was
numbered
1742
where
the
original
ommegang
lacks
the
punch
other
belgian
dubblesdark
ales
maredsous
chimay
grand
reserve
etc
have
the
cave
aged
version
just
about
equals
them
it
was
much
more
chocolatey
and
smooth
almost
perfect
its
almost
as
if
this
was
the
beer
the
brewery
ommegang
was
attempting
to
create
instead
of
the
young
version
the
best
way
to
describe
it
is
its
depth
it
makes
the
young
ommegang
look
simple
in
comparison
and
rivals
belgian
dark
ales
if
for
some
reason
you
dont
like
the
young
ommegang
and
you
like
other
belgian
dubbelsdark
ales
try
to
get
your
hands
on
the
cave
aged
version
it
will
surprise
you
this
is
another
surprising
good
belgian
style
dubbel
from
the
good
ole
us
of
a
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
hops
are
stronger
than
most
of
their
other
styles
which
is
pretty
much
an
automatic
plus
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
blend
of
hops
is
smooth
with
a
hidden
bit
of
a
bite
the
are
contrasting
flavors
in
this
beer
and
it
leaves
the
palate
clean
afterwards
an
thick
and
creamy
head
that
resembles
shaving
cream
almost
if
you
have
not
had
this
one
i
recommend
trying
it
ommegang
wow
is
this
a
nice
beer
in
the
big
25
ounce
bottle
it
pours
a
very
nice
looking
reddishbrown
with
not
much
head
but
what
there
is
is
a
nice
offwhite
that
leaves
a
skim
of
lace
the
aroma
is
much
closer
to
wine
than
lots
and
lots
of
other
beers
out
there
on
the
market
very
fruity
with
a
hint
of
a
rich
red
wine
on
the
nose
the
taste
does
not
stray
far
from
the
aroma
with
a
very
prominent
fruit
flavors
with
a
hint
and
a
bare
hint
of
yeastbananas
over
a
crisp
dry
wineish
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
but
watch
out
for
the
alcohol
warmth
and
the
heat
very
nice
looks
delicious
a
deep
red
that
looks
brown
without
backlighting
should
be
poured
with
some
vigor
for
a
goodsized
head
to
form
oh
my
what
an
aroma
dark
and
dried
fruits
galore
raisins
grapes
and
grape
leaves
dominate
spicy
yeast
undertones
are
also
present
i
think
im
getting
slight
spicy
alcohol
as
well
im
noticing
a
trend
with
the
grape
aromas
in
brewery
ommegangs
beers
thats
why
i
mention
grape
and
not
just
raisin
its
kind
of
a
mixture
of
both
dried
and
fresh
grapes
i
think
its
great
not
so
winelike
in
that
it
well
doesnt
smell
almost
like
vinegar
anyway
on
to
the
most
anticipated
part
the
flavor
surprisingly
big
hop
character
here
but
not
at
all
too
much
that
hits
first
then
spicy
yeast
comes
in
these
are
the
two
most
noticeable
characteristics
fruitiness
here
is
quite
subdued
compared
to
that
of
the
aroma
but
still
present
in
a
little
raisin
and
plum
especially
in
the
back
spicy
alcohol
warms
the
mouth
soon
after
imbibing
is
commenced
maltiness
is
mostly
caramel
but
a
bit
bready
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
leafy
character
in
the
quality
as
well
this
is
my
favorite
dubbel
so
far
great
combination
of
ingredients
when
i
get
more
of
this
ill
have
to
make
some
belgian
frites
fries
to
eat
with
it
this
will
make
you
think
that
cooperstown
new
york
is
actually
part
of
belgium
highly
recommended
redishbrown
color
bannana
clove
fruity
aroma
light
foamy
head
leaves
a
thick

in
the
glass
full
and
chewy
mouthfeel
sweet
caramel
candy
malty
flavor
beautiful
lasting
finish
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
nice
when
poured
it
was
a
dark
hazy
brown
with
a
light
brown
foam
the
smell
was
of
hops
malts
and
citrus
with
a
hint
of
yeast
all
was
good
until
i
tasted
this
beer
although
the
taste
of
malts
citrus
green
apples
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
downer
was
the
sour
taste
that
i
got
in
my
mouth
and
palate
the
little
bitterness
was
well
balanced
that
could
have
made
this
beer
absolutely
great
except
for
that
sour
finish
if
the
sour
after
tase
was
gone
i
would
have
really
like
it
i
had
to
rewrite
my
review
for
this
one
when
i
had
it
initially
i
was
still
pretty
green
to
the
craft
beer
world
and
this
i
thought
was
the
pinnacle
of
what
it
can
offer
in
its
defense
it
is
absolutely
a
well
crafted
brew
that
i
can
appreciate
but
i
just
dont
like
the
flavor
its
very
heavy
on
the
cherries
and
raisins
but
no
interesting
malt
or
yeast
flavors
for
support
id
skip
this
one
and
get
hennepin
instead
drinking
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
enjoying
a
fine
vintage
port
with
its
sweet
yet
very
complex
bouquet
and
flavors
it
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
very
lovely
thick
offwhite
colored
head
a
very
nice
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
fruitiness
of
plum
raisin
and
banana
and
a
touch
of
molasses
the
taste
is
complex
with
notes
of
sweet
fresh
fruit
that
seem
to
diminish
somewhat
as
the
beer
warms
as
it
then
takes
on
more
of
a
sweet
malty
and
nutty
flavor
it
has
a
very
nice
creamy
feeling
in
the
mouth
and
is
quite
smooth
i
really
like
this
beer
and
as
others

that

its
not

insofar

the

a

sweetness
that
becomes
quite
cloying
as
one
proceeds
through
a

sour
at
times

the
overarching
effect
of

is
difficult
to
ignore
body
on

the

i
do
not
consider
this
to
be

some
fruitiness
is
pleasant
but
should
not

i
do
a
very
nice
belgian
beer
here
that
didnt
pour
great
but
started
to
pick
up
soon
after
that
it
was
malty
and
had
some
sweetness
in
there
giving
it
a
fairly
basic
but
pleasant
taste
that
was
well
balanced
and
went
down
quite
easily
there
was
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
but
this
didnt
seem
to
follow
through
to
the

way
a

i
wouldnt

found
this
at
a
tavern
while
on

in

recently
i
remembered
that
i
thought
it
was
fantastic

that
might
have
been
because
i
had
been
forced
to
drink
many
truly
pedestrian
pilsners
and
lagers
on
the
trip
it
seems
that
at

95
of
establishments
there
only
have
amstel
heineken
and
a
few
other
local
beers
almost
nobody
makes
an
effort
to
get
good
beers
into
the
country
this
looked

tasted
and
felt
great
and
yet
somewhat
lighter
that
i
would
have
thought
still
i
was
so
thankful
when
i
stumbled

the

that
had
it

great

i
think
though
this
needs
to
be
paired
with

meal
the
mrs
loved
it
by
itself
with
the
sips
she
had
but
i
kept
wanting
to
some
food
to
have
with
it
so
not
a
beer
to
stand
alone
and
therefore
not
very
drinkable
for
me
in
the
absence
of
food
but
definitely
a
very
interesting
beer
overall
to
pick
out
all
the
flavors
plus
from
what
i
read
this
one
is
very
close
to
style
so
i
have
to
give
it
good
marks
for
that
overall
this
looked
like
an
interesting
beer
but
it
didnt
deliver
not
bad
but
not
one
id
get
again
as
it
is
a
weak

of
this
style
the

with

otherwise

this

with

ring

held

sweetness
very

sweet
and
complex
with
a

character
as
it

more
prune
dominates
the
taste
its
quite
nice
a
bit
sweet
but
overall
very
good
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
somewhat
standard
for
a
dubbel
maybe
a
bit
low
on
the
carbonation
front
overall
its
a
very
good
dubbel
a
nice
surprise
the
fruity
flavors
are
pleasant
and
it
was
quite
complex
in
many
ways
worth
trying
at
the
very
least
o
a
solid
dubble
nothing
more
nothing
less
if
you
like
sweet
beers
give
this
a
shot
its
a
pleasant
drinker
with
nothing
offensive
about
it
still
average
dubble
it
may
not
be
great
but
its
enjoyable
a
dubbel
sure
but
in
a
rather
newbie
weakly
pandering
manner
complexity
seems
lost
on
this
one
and
the
adjunct
ingredients
while
not
overly
apparent
still
add
little
to
the
mix
if
at
all
easy
enough
to
drink
but
hardly
up
to
the
measure
of
almost
any
other
true
belgian
offering
of
the
sort
one
of
my
standby
ales
if
i
dont
know
what
i
want
in
the
liquor
store
i
know
that
ill
be
pleased
with
a
six
pack
of
this
in
the
refrigerator
allinall
this
beer
was
slightly
disappointing
to
me
due
to
the
flavors
within
the
beer
counter
acting
each
others
positive
qualities
however
the
latter
is
just
my
opinion
and
i
encourage
everyone
to
try
something
at
least
twice
once
for
curiosity
and
twice
for
the
hell
of
it
overall
a
fairly
nice
if
unremarkable
beer

of
the
best
beers
of
this
style
but
that
is
not
to
its
discredit
i
find
this
a
much
more
approachable
and
drinkable
dubbel
than
many
as
evidenced
by
how
easily
this
half
liter
slid
down
a
little
thin
on
the
body
for
me
but
that
works
fine
with
the
gentle
carbonation
its
got
a
sliky
smooth
texture
that
i
adore
and
to
me
this
is
the
best
of
the
grimbergen
beers
well
worth
it
espeicaly
on
tap
overall
i
think
its
a
great
beer
on
belgium
standards
however
its
not
up
to
par
i
love
belgians
and
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
out
of
the
mecca
o
i
think
i
liked
the
grimbergen
blonde
better
but
this
is
a
good
option
for
someone
to
dabble
in
when
trying
belgian
styles
makes
a
good
transition
to
the
style
this
is
a
pretty
simple
dubbel
i
like
the
clean
presence
on
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
23
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
slight
hop
slight
yeast
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
dubbel
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
slight
yeast
and
a
hint
of
hop
overall
good
appearance
and
aroma
but
body
is
a
little
weak
and
the
feel
is
too
carbonated
o
not
in
the
same
league
as
some
of
the
better
known
trappist
and
abbey
ales
but
was
a
pleasant
accompaniment
to
a
wood
fired
pork
chop
with
grilled
peaches
and
greens
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
do
this
is
good
i
liked
it
and
would
have
it
again
that
said
20
liters
is
a
lot
and
im
not
sure
if
i
would
enjoy
an
entire
keg
of
it
as
i
worked
through
the
glass
the
sweetness
began
to
overwhelm
the
sourness
and
what
little
bitterness
exists
on
the
back
end
is
woefully
inadequate
to
stand
up
to
the
other
flavors
here
in
summary
good
but
not
great
o
a
well
made
enjoyable
heavy
malt
beer
though
light
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
o
like
a
cousin
to
gouden
carolus
classic
this
tasty
dubbel
goes
down
easy
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
rich
coloring
it
initially
appeared
jet
black
but
as
it
warmed
and
when
held
to
light
more
maroon
hues
began
to
shine
through
otherwise
the
tasting
was
overly
sweet
with
this
style
the
sugars
should
come
from
the
malts
themselves
and
have
a
deeper
more
serious
cooked
caramel
flavoring
here
the
sweetness
came
from
additive
fruitiness
which
was
overdone
and
overpowering
o
rather
dissapointing
all
the
flavours
are
there
but
too
faint
sorry
food
match
desserts
of
course
and
when
it
comes
to
desserts
its
any
mans
or
womans
game
however
i
think
like
for
like
something
with
macerated
figs
would
go
well
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
my
favorite
but
it
wasnt
bad
unspectacular
belgian
ale
has
some
character
and
easy
drinkability

the

smell
is

aromas
taste
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
and
some
more
mild
brown
sugar
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
set
or
aromas
and
flavors
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
o
good
drinker
nice
for
the
style
o
this
is
a
dubbel
but
screams
winter
to
me
probably
because
of
the
ginger
notes
i
picked
up
i
really
enjoy
the
unique
flavors
here
not
found
in
every
dubbel
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
my
lunch
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
would
have
another
odecent
dubbel
ale
with
good
flavor
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
dark
toffee
brown
with
a
light
frothy
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacy
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
toffee
and
dark
fruits
its
the
typical
dubbel
smell
but
it
is
a
bit
faint
compared
to
some
others
of
the
style
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
the
smells
there
are
flavors
of
roasted
malts
and
toffee
the
dark
fruit
taste
is
there
as
well
its
definitely
a
bit
bready
from
the
malt
the
alcohol
is
not
strong
in
the
flavor
but
it
should
not
be
at
only
6
5
however
it
definitely
is
there
an
unfortunate
problem
with
this
beer
is
it
a
little
watery
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
there
is
moderate
carbonation
its
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
not
the
greatest
dubbel
ive
ever
had
but
its
certainly
worth
trying
it
is
a
little
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
o
not
terrible
but
a
hard
category
to
be
in
there
are
tons
of
better
dubbels
out
there
but
this
is
definitely
a
solid
entry
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
but
so
are
many
dubbels
overall
quite
sugary
quite
fruity
its
ok
o
this
was
a
nice
surprise
that
added
to
my
love
of
belgian
ales
o
an
ok
dubbel
at
a
good
price
liked
it
on
tap
an
easy
drinker
but
nothing
outstanding
a
nice
dubbel
a
bit
tired
this
one
though
o
very
enjoyable
once
i
go
for
frequently
but
like
many
grimbergen
beers
i
find
them
a
bit
too
sweet
i
find
myself
liking
dubbels
more
and
more
lately
mostly
americans
but
its
good
to
be
reminded
where
they
originated
in
beers
like
this
one
i
do
think
i
have
found
a
new
favorite
dubbel
overall
awesome
beer
notes
its
bready
and
nicely
hearty

after
trying
hard
enough
i
recognized

taste
is
quite

but
unfortunately

although
quite
unique
aftertaste
is
also
sweet
and
the

is
even
more
obvious
along
with
some
oplums
maybe
alcohol
is
not
so
traceable
thin
bodied
and
watery
for
for
a
dubbel

some
dryness

good

but
not
as
good
as

other

dubbel
3

d
simple
but
easy
to
drink
beer
o
great
had
this
beer
with
a
ruben
sandwich
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
overall
this
is
actually
a
very
nice
dubbeldouble
ale
whichever
way
you
want
to
pronounce
it
very
impressed
and
happy
to
have
scored
a
bottle
of
this
beer
the
beer
got
better
is
it
warmed
up
to
room
temperature
o
im
not
saying
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
definitely
not
satisfied
with
it
either
i
really
like
the
blonde
so
i
really
thought
this
would
be
on
par
with
it
there
just
didnt
seem
to
be
a
much
here
to
talk
about
it
was
okay
to
try
but
i
doubt
ill
be
trying
it
again
overall
first
time
i
had
heard
of
this
belgian
brewery
and
i
was
very
impressed
overall
not
bad
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
in
complexity
nothing
here
to
drive
me
to
want
more
i
found
it
to
be
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
on
par
and
the
doesnt
coat
the
tongue
very
much
the
mild
hops
near
the
end
leave
a
bitter
finish
not
interesting
overall
this
is
a
pretty
well
put
together
beer
it
is
somewhat
light
for
a
full
flavor
beer
but
it
is
a
beer
which
improves
with
the
time
you
take
to
drink
it
hope
you
all
enjoy
and
drink
with
pride
this
belgian
pours
redbrownkind
of
raisin
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
thin
skim
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
sweet
raisin
caramel
and
fig
with
fruity
esters
the
flavor
is
intensely
malty
mainly
raisin
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
warm
malts
linger
on
the
palate
the
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
and
body
mediumfull
overall
a
wellmade
flavorful
beer
best
after
warming
considerably
otherwise
it
is
a
bit
onedimensional
a
bit
lacking
i
vaguely
remember
trying
this
well
over
a
year
ago
back
in
my
nova
days
but
not
enough
to
sate
my
curious
brain
better
to
have
it
possibly
again
i
always
say
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
russet
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
light
molasses
sweet
figs
and
maple
syrup
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
keeping
that
sweetleaning
course
very
tightly
kind
of
odd
that
i
dont
get
too
much
of
the
usual
belgianness
on
the
tongue
but
this
lack
doesnt
hurt
things
very
much
at
all
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
dubbel
one
of
the
sweeter
ones
ive
ever
had
but
a
generally
enjoyable
drink
a
very
good
beer
thats
not
overly
heavy
or
sweet
it
walks
that
fine
line
perfectly
id
like
to
see
some
more
of
a
foamy
cap
to
pump
up
the
appearance
im
glad
i
had
the
trappistes
rochefet
10
before
writing
this
review
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
but
it
is
second
to
the
rochefet
10
at
this
point
lots
of
fruity
aromas
but
a
little
too
thick
and
sweet
my
favorite
part
is
the
chocolate
covered
cherry
flavor
carbonation
was
not
as
crisp
as
i
would
like
but
it
is
a
good
belgian
dubbel
decent
not
the
best
not
the
worst
dubbel
o
nice
sweet
but
not
overly
subtle
or
complex
the
only
problem
with
this
great
brew
might
be
that
there
is
too
much
going
on
none
of
this
is
bad
and
this
is
highly
recommended
and
i
will
buy
it
again
a
deep
rubybrown
beer
with
a
modest
opaque
head
on
top
it
smells
of
brandy
sherry
molasses
and
caramel
dark
fruits
as
well
are
present
in
the
aromamellow
but
rich
a
sip
reveals
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
hint
of
that
brandysherry
like
aroma
coming
through
in
the
flavor
it
has
a
pretty
clean
flavor
for
a
dubbel
but
with
a
tiny
amount
of
sharp
sourness
just
a
hint
though
it
balances
out
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
nicely
it
has
a
full
smooth
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
quite
a
pleasant
beer
and
a
bit
more
straightforward
than
most
dubbels
i
have
tried
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
which
i
consider
a
plus
very
nice
worth
a
try
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
and
belgian
yeast
sweet
in
the
mouth
delicious
better
in
the
taste
than
in
the
nose
so
easy
to
drink
almost
light
bodied
o
a
decent
double
one
of
the
best
from
the
supermarket
overall
its
ok
for
a
pleasant
beer
but
seriously
lacking
as
a
dubbel
theres
nothing
unpleasant
at
all
about
it
but
not
enough
on
the
plus
side
to
cause
me
to
buy
it
again
o
a
very
clean
and
pleasant
dubbel
but
not
as
complex
and
distinctive
as
the
best
examples
a
good
solid
belgian
beer
im
glad
i
can
get
it
in
the
beer
desert
of
spain
pours
a
brilliant
brown
malty
nose
i
found
it
refreshing
that
the
typical
smell
of
a
belgian
hop
strain
didnt
reach
out
and
smack
me
in
the
nose
this
one
is
definitely
chock
full
of
caramel
malt
and
a
tinge
of
smokiness
goes
down
real
smooth
hope
to
see
this
again
in
the
future
o
found
it
quite
appealing
esay
to
drink
nice
flavors
and
mouthfeel
a
good
dubbel
at
a
good
price
drink
a
pretty
decent
import
to
have
at
the
pool
in
laughlin
needed
a
better
glass
may
have
to
have
this
one
again
o
it
was
pretty
good
i
usually
make
a
judgement
call
on
the
first
smell
so
my
expectations
dropped
when
i
got
a
whiff
if
anything
the
beer
is
full
of
surprises
both
good
and
bad
o
a
pleasant
treat
the
moscato
of
beer
something
you
can
probably
serve
to
a
nonbeer
fan
and
theyd
probably
enjoy
it
smell
was
the
weakest
point
of
this
beer
it
was
typical
steel
barrel
and
that
was
it
nothing
else
taste
was
very
good
spicy
and
bready
while
having
a
subtle
cinnamon
and
banana
taste
mouthfeel
was
decent
but
nothing
special
having
never
heard
of
this
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
after
trying
it
at
a
local
bar
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
i
tried
this
beer
on
tap
on
march
24
2011
at
the
town
crier
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
reddishbrown
with
a
huge
tan
coloured
head
the
aroma
was
yeast
caramel
malt
nuts
and
fruit
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
sweet
malt
yeast
and
spices
feels
foamy
and
thick
in
my
mouth
good
body
to
it
maybe
a
bit
high
on
the
carbonation
very
fun
to
drink
and
had
alot
of
fun
breaking
this
one
down
another
great
belgian
that
i
highly
recommend
overall
excellent
craft
brew
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
hearty
meal
good
to
drink
casually
but
not
for
speed
good
taste
and
good
beer
this
is
the
sort
of
dubbel
i
like
overall
good
beer
pours
brown
ruby
hints
in
the
light
fluffy
white
head
slightly
sticky
with
some
lace
smell
is
dark
fruit
in
alcohol
plum
raisin
cherry
light
alc
and
yeast
taste
is
dark
fruit
ripe
cherry
yeasty
alc
that
comes
and
goes
brown
sugar
plum
and
yeast
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
medium
carb
and
medium
weight
overall
this
isnt
bad
not
stellar
but
can
hold
its
own
the
dark
fruit
character
is
quite
nice
here
a
very
good
dubbel
definitely
worth
a
try
a
very
elegant
and
complex
belgian
ale
and
a
beer
experience
worth
repeating
a
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
o
good
balanced
dubbel
and
quite
a
bit
better
than
the
bottle
from
what
i
remember
not
too
sweet
good
dark
fruit
character
roasted
malt
nose
with
a
subtle
touch
of
green
gooseberries
still
brings
a
bit
of
acidity
both
in
the
nose
or
in
the
body
in
the
mouth
the
body
of
the
dress
and
the
bitterness
is
balanced
by
a
subtle
fruity
touch
the
finish
is
bitter
not
too
exaggerated
with
the
presence
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
dr
all
in
all
its
poorly
priced
by
ibiza
standards
but
i
do
suspect
its
very
fairly
priced
elsewhere
especially
in
belgium
it
doesnt
hide
its
abv
well
but
its
the
best
beer
ive
had
on
ibiza
so
far
unless
you
count
guinness
skip
this
one
unless
youre
really
into
generic
abbey
beers
that
try
to
steal
trappist
marketing
poured
a
1
5
head
of
irregular
sized
bubbles
clear
dark
burnt
umber
brown
color
not
much
smell
coming
off
it
just
a
hint
of
the
hops
flavor
has
a
hint
of
raisins
and
caramel
but
really
not
a
very
powerful
or
complex
taste
theres
an
acidic
zing
in
a
moderate
finish
well
its
drinkable
but
this
is
a
dubbel
dubbel
what
mouthfeel
is
sublime
the
palate
opens
with
a
sharp
sweetness
with
a
blend
of
cherry
and
cola
along
with
a
healthy
dose
of
sugar
moderately
fruity
in
the
midpalate
theres
some
dried
figs
with
a
mild
nutty
bitterness
present
the
finish
is
a
little
disappointing
with
a
fruity
colalike
character
before
fizzling
out
as
it
warms
up
theres
some
spice
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
noticeable
the
spice
is
kinda
like
christmas
spices
and
a
little
bit
goes
a
long
way
ultimately
this
is
decent
and
on
the
sweeter
end
of
the
dubbel
spectrum
poured
rootbeer
brown
with
glistening
red
and
gold
decent
head
that
didnt
linger
much
fruity
nose
with
alcohol
evident
tastes
bubbly
yeasty
and
like
dried
figs
and
dates
good
vibrant
carbonation
and
not
as
creamy
as
some
other
dubbels
dry
finish
very
enjoyable
let
this
beer
warm
up
some
it
wasnt
until
23
of
the
way
through
did
i
realize
how
good
this
beer
actually
is
overall
an
ok
example
definetly
drinkable
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
but
it
was
rich
and
had
plenty
of
carbonation
this
one
is
better
than
most
particulary
as
an
import
d
very
glad
to
have
this
will
easily
do
in
the
6
pack
over
the
next
couple
days
d
delicious
not
world
class
but
quite
good
worth
trying
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
smoke
very
smooth
mouthfull
it
has
the
feel
of
cough
mixture
its
a
bit
sticky
so
i
wouldnt
want
too
many
but
overall
a
decent
double
d
despite
its
drawbacks
goes
down
nicely
on
the
palate
you
get
a
a
lot
of
deep
rich
malt
notes
that
trend
towards
chocolate
and
perhaps
a
slight
raisin
note
the
yeast
flavors
are
evident
but
not
overwhelming
it
has
a
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
lingering
finish
d
a
decent
dubbel
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
md
feels
very
smooth
good
carbonation
and
abv
pretty
drinkable
d
this
is
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
and
nice
example
of
the
style
da
bit
too
sweet
but
still
good
may
try
again
as
a
desert
beer
drinkability
is
awesome
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
does
not
fill
you
up
but
is
so
complex
with
flavor
it
is
now
one
of
my
new
favorites
and
this
bottle
is
going
on
my
wall
of
greatness
d
decent
beer
drinks
well
with
nice
sweet
and
mild
toffe
and
chocolate
notes
some
hop
dryness
and
some
bread
a
better
than
o
k
brew
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
two
inches
of
beige
head
it
is
copper
colored
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
plenty
of
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
malt
with
some
mild
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
has
some
moderate
viscosity
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
makes
this
a
remarkably
easy
drinking
beer
good
but
not
great
taste
is
fruity
with
an
odd
smartees
candy
and
sourskittles
sweetness
that
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
gives
the
mouthfeel
the
impression
of
being
thin
with
the
lack
of
a
dense
caramel
malt
backbone
that
usually
accompanies
a
dubbel
for
me
this
needs
more
malt
less
fruit
and
a
thicker
body
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
if
you
are
thinking
of
trying
it
dont
hesitate
pours
a
somewhat
dark
mahogany
with
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
and
some
pretty
good
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
brings
out
some
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
toffee
taste
is
some
hints
of
fruit
as
well
as
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
some
belgian
yeast
characteristics
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
slightly
creamy
decent
enough
beer
but
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
the
better
versions
of
this
style
this
beer
has
flavor
and
it
really
isnt
an
avoid
its
just
not
a
very
good
dubbel
on
a
recent
trip
to
france
i
became
quite
acquainted
with
grimbergen
blonde
in
the
50cl
cans
and
found
it
to
be
a
fairly
sweet
but
overall
enjoyable
beer
sorry
for
the
5second
review
the
dubble
is
in
the
same
league
again
quite
nice
in
its
own
way
and
certainly
exuding
a
distinct
personality
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
but
overall
its
not
the
best
example
of
this
style
jd
d
pretty
drinkable
might
get
this
again
although
there
are
cheaper
and
better
alternatives
served
on
tap
and
a
bit
too
chilled
i
believe
as
far
as
belgian
brews
go
the
smell
seemed
hardly
to
reach
my
nose
the
taste
though
malty
and
smooth
suffered
from
an
apparently
lower
level
of
complexity
brown
sugar
and
a
decentlyheavy
maltiness
were
my
predominant
impressions
again
im
thinking
that
the
overchilling
factor
subdued
a
lot
of
potential
in
the
flavor
department
but
big
thumbs
up
on
drinkability
id
love
to
try
it
again
if
not
simply
for
drinkability
then
in
hopes
of
finding
a
greater
complexity
the
second
time
around
picked
this
up
at
the
supermercardo
in
puerto
de
santa
maria
for
about
1
6
euros
worth
the
drive
and
poor
queuing
poured
into
a
coors
banquet
beer
pilsner
glass
and
got
a
rich
two
inch
white
head
which
was
surprising
due
to
the
tawny
red
colour
of
the
ale
nice
dubbel
nice
taste
not
too
malty
and
worth
a
session
of
two
or
three
enjoyed
it
with
my
stogie
on
a
warm
spanish
evening
adios
murky
dark
amber
almost
brown
in
body
topped
by
large
frothy
off
white
head
fragrant
aroma
of
alcohol
sweets
caramel
burnt
sugar
prunes
dark
fruit
slight
raisin
and
kiwi
and
some
spice
flavors
of
prunes
raisins
kiwi
sugars
sweets
slight
candied
apple
towards
the
finish
light
medium
carb
in
body
with
a
sour
aftertaste
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
the
flavors
gradually
become
less
irritating
as
you
drink
it
but
it
is
not
one
worth
purchasing
again
d
okay
this
isnt
a
dubbel
to
write
home
about
but
its
drinkable
belgians
arent
my
favorite
style
and
this
one
is
just
okay
d
an
average
dubbel
tastes
a
bit
mass
produced
for
nuance
and
complexity
look
elsewhere
drinkability
very
drinkable
ill
give
it
another
try
taste
was
a
mix
of
banana
clove
caramel
toffee
no
hops
pretty
much
true
to
style
dont
go
knockin
on
belgiums
door
lookin
for
hops
or
bitterness
more
alcohol
than
i
would
have
preferred
to
taste
finishes
thin
and
hot
not
for
hopheads
a
good
beer
but
a
little
lackluster
in
terms
of
having
dominant
features
for
the
nose
and
taste
i
will
most
likely
pick
up
another
from
a
different
batch
perhaps
some
time
in
the
future
as
a
test
d
despite
the
heavy
flavors
it
is
still
pretty
drinkable
although
i
would
prefer
maybe
a
slightly
drier
or
hoppier
finish
to
balance
all
of
that
toffee
out
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
apple
pie
or
cake
or
some
sweet
dessert
pours
a
deep
dark
ruby
brown
with
about
a
cm
of
creamy
tan
head
that
isnt
going
anywhere
in
a
hurry
smells
of
yeast
malt
some
banana
the
taste
is
actually
very
clean
for
a
dubbel
theres
a
lot
of
malty
sweetness
and
very
little
bitterness
but
it
finishes
fairly
cleanly
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
very
nice
overall
one
of
the
more
drinkable
dubbels
ive
had
d
good
i
personally
like
the
belgium
dubbel
style
and
grimbergen
represents
it
very
well
i
really
recommend
it
d
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
have
quite
enough
of
a
complex
taste
to
leave
me
wanting
to
drink
another
drinkability
superb
this
is
one
of
those
im
going
to
give
myself
a
present
brews
very
tasty
stuff
picked
this
one
up
at
j
barleycorn
in
nashville
tn
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
grimbergen
double
is
a
clear
rubyamber
color
with
a
huge
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
lots
of
chunky
sticky
lacing
must
not
be
bottle
conditioned
as
there
is
no
apparent
yeast
to
be
found
either
in
suspension
or
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
nose
is
very
malt
forward
toffee
and
caramel
a
touch
of
dark
fruitiness
and
yeasty
phenols
the
flavor
echoes
the
nose
with
the
fruitiness
dominating
more
than
i
expected
some
toffee
mild
chocolate
anise
and
hints
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
had
expected
and
with
a
beer
as
sweet
as
it
is
i
was
surprised
by
the
very
dry
finish
overall
a
drinkable
beer
seems
a
little
offstyle
but
still
very
good
actually
pretty
good
not
as
good
as
many
trappist
examples
of
the
style
but
for
a
beer
from
a
european
macro
brewery
they
have
done
a
good
job
d
this
is
pretty
good
but
im
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
on
a
regular
basis
a
solid
beer
though
i
feel
it
would
be
much
better
out
of
the
bottle
with
more
carbonation
to
cut
the
sweetish
finish
dthis
is
a
great
beer
a
wonderful
melding
of
malty
goodness
with
an
ever
so
light
hop
bitterning
at
the
finish
while
this
is
not
the
best
at
2
a
bottle
it
is
certainly
an
inexpensive
dubbel
fix
if
youre
strapped
for
cash
ill
be
sure
to
get
another
the
next
time
i
see
one
d
dangerously
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
d
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
and
there
is
almost
no
hint
of
alcohol
add
to
that
the
fact
that
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
and
it
scores
high
on
drinkablity
all
in
all
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
at
all
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
flavor
as
ive
even
had
some
domestic
expressions
that
were
superior
thick
viscous
mouthfeel
in
the
beginning
gives
way
to
a
decidedly
thinner
body
not
very
drinkable
due
to
the
intense
sweetness
and
lack
of
carbonation
and
hop
balance
id
have
no
problem
throwing
back
a
few
of
these
overall
im
diggin
this
no
cloying
sweet
raisin
and
rubbing
alcohol
elements
lower
in
alcohol
so
no
real
bite
you
could
put
a
couple
of
these
down
because
of
that
fact
alone
the
dryness
at
the
finish
impedes
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
not
much
try
this
still
worth
it
d
this
beer
is
packed
with
flavor
and
highly
drinkable
i
picked
this
up
as
a
single
but
wish
i
had
a
few
more
ill
definitely
grab
this
one
again
notes
overrated
maybe
because
it
is
so
common
these
days
at
least
in
most
common
markets
around
madrid
and
yet
it
is
a
large
scale
belgium
dubbel
that
remains
reliable
and
pretty
solid
despite
its
ubiquity
again
maybe
its
nothing
extraordinary
but
there
are
no
complaints
to
having
something
like
this
handy
next
to
some
of
the
local
swill
the
second
glass
was
better
kinda
like
the
more
you
drink
it
the
better
it
taste
definitely
will
be
visiting
again
grimbergen
dubbel
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
there
didnt
appear
to
be
a
very
strong
smell
it
tasted
rather
heavy
not
too
hoppy
and
strong
falvors
and
an
almost
sweet
taste
as
well
it
was
rather
easy
to
drink
and
there
were
no
really
strong
aftertastes
overall
grimbergen
dubbel
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
the
best
in
this
style
the
problem
is
carbonation
which
is
lacking
its
tough
to
glean
everything
interpret
on
the
palate
without
bubbles
breaking
it
up
its
not
too
heavy
but
its
mix
of
flavors
is
rather
muddled
after
having
it
a
few
times
this
is
becoming
one
of
my
favs
that
i
know
ill
keep
going
back
to
drank
it
during
my
dinner
which
was
a
good
companion
with
the
food
enjoyed
it
d
would
be
willing
to
drink
these
often
they
are
also
cheap
when
compared
to
other
doubles
goes
down
smooth
but
is
also
a
bit
lower
abv
than
the
norm
taste
is
of
sweet
toffee
and
chewy
candy
with
some
raisin
like
fruits
to
accompany
it
then
some
sweet
strawberry
fondue
chocolate
goin
on
there
as
well
feel
and
drinkability
light
on
the
palate
with
mediumlow
levels
of
fine
carbonation
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
its
aftertaste
doesnt
linger
as
long
as
id
like
but
its
a
decent
enough
beer
feels
just
a
bit
too
light
on
the
palate
a
little
to
smooth
and
slick
too
watery
more
body
would
beneit
this
beer
more
malt
and
a
bit
less
sugar
would
give
this
beer
a
more
interesting
flavor
and
feel
its
still
good
and
ill
enjoy
it
and
most
likely
but
it
again
i
like
this
beer
but
there
are
definitely
better
out
there
reasonably
priced
it
was
very
enjoyable
and
balanced
while
not
having
any
one
flavor
dominate
like
the
malt
a
very
nice
beer
thats
good
but
not
great
grimbergen
dubbel
has
a
medium
to
heavy
body
with
moderate
carbonation
the
texture
is
a
touch
syrupy
but
not

thought
this
was
a
pretty

dubbel
with
the
characteristics
i
would

with

beer
i
would
love
to
enjoy
this
with
a
nice
steak
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
as
the
abv
is
managable

medium

with

a
little
to

as
a

beer
its
very
good

review
translated
from
french
5242008
this
was
one
my
dads
favs
in
the
70s
i
dont
think
its
brewed
by
the
same
people
though
pours
a
clear
deep
reddishbrown
w
a
thin
offwhite
head
which
dissipates
quickly
huh
no
yeast
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
moderate
broken
lacing
a
sweet
fruity
caramelized
aroma
dates
maybe
a
hint
of
butter
maybe
a
crisp
sweet
brandyish
flavor
w
a
slight
metallic
taste
some
fruity
undertones
a
little
watered
down
tasting
actually
not
a
really
noteworthy
belgian
dubbel
definitely
not
the
grimbergen
i
remember
a
little
on
the
lighterbodied
sidetoo
but
the
co2
helps
cover
that
a
drinkable
one
but
i
put
this
one
on
the
bottom
of
my
style
list
so
far
d
very
drinkable
for
a
dubbel
not
too
malty
or
sweet
not
too
pricey
a
good
easily
accessible
belgian
looks
beautiful
in
the
glass
with
rich
crystalline
red
color
and
a
nice
head
not
much
aroma
a
good
amount
of
nice
dried
fruit
notes
with
more
of
a
brandyish
quality
coming
through
as
i
got
further
into
the
glass
more
dried
fruit
in
the
finish
particularly
some
cherry
and
prune
notes
i
wouldve
guessed
this
had
more
alcohol
surprisingly
clean
finish
for
such
a
sweet
beer
but
still
a
little
cloying
by
the
end
of
the
glass
still
overall
an
aboveaverage
dubbel
a
tasty
beer
with
a
fair
bit
going
on
all
be
it
in
an
almost
behind
the
scenes
way
some
residual
sweetness
assuming
its
from
dark
candi
sugar
but
very
well
attenuated
almost
managing
a
dry
finish
making
for
a
very
drinkable
ale
it
would
be
no
chore
to
knock
a
few
of
these
back
would
serve
as
a
good
approachable
belgiandubbel
thanks
to
my
wife
nicci
for
picking
this
up
for
me
an
enjoyable
belgian
double
overall
in
my
opinion
the
best
grimbergen
in
the
market
very
nice
body
and
perfect
level
of
sweetness
looking
forward
for
another
one
drinkibility
is
much
greater
than
most
belgian
dubbels
i
could
drink
three
to
four
of
these
where
normally
i
would
limit
it
to
one
or
two
i
think
this
is
an
underrated
dubbel
especially
for
its
price
i
found
very
little
to
criticize
to
tell
the
truth
not
world
class
but
a
very
solid
representation
of
a
belgian
that
is
highly
enjoyable
and
very
accessible
to
friends
who
you
may
be
trying
to
turn
onto
beers
that
they
may
otherwise
find
daunting
ill
be
getting
this
again
solid
but
ultimately
underwhelming
a
clean
tasting
dubbel
but
just
a
little
bit
low
on
flavour
and
overall
character
a
bit
dark
not
too
sweet
pomegrant
juice
a
bit
of
head
on
darkish
brown
malty
yeasty
aroma
balanced
bit
nothing
too
special
a
bit
raisin
wine
sourish
and
bitter
amidst
yeast
drinkable
brew
but
soso
for
a
belg
carmel
and
a
touch
of
toastiness
a
very
good
brew
and
one
of
the
first
dubbels
ive
tried
i
enjoy
this
style
and
will
look
for
more
pours
a
nice
medium
brown
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
that
fades
into
a
nice
thin
layer
on
top
of
the
brew
the
smell
as
the
head
retreats
is
a
nice
fruity
blend
of
raisin
apple
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
but
nowhere
near
overwhelming
with
a
slightly
bitter
undertone
that
tames
the
fruit
flows
smoothly
through
the
mouth
leaving
a
clean
and
filmless
feeling
very
tasty
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
to
have
too
many
in
one
sitting
a
great
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
some
nice
clear
ruby
highlights
and
a
pale
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
nicely
balanced
aroma
of
dark
fruits
baked
apples
and
an
earthy
hint
that
reminds
me
of
cigar
tobacco
some
nice
doughyyeasty
notes
in
there
too
on
the
palate
things
are
a
tad
too
sweet
but
still
dry
overall
light
raisins
and
rum
coexist
with
some
bandaid
elements
and
baked
apple
spices
licorice
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
for
a
dubbel
and
quite
well
carbonated
for
the
style
but
not
over
the
top
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
dubbel
especially
for
the
price
quite
decent
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
up
front
along
with
yeasty
doughy
goodness
raisins
and
caramel
duke
it
out
to
the
finish
im
tempted
to
bump
the
flavor
score
because
the
beer
really
does
nothing
wrong
trouble
is
it
does
almost
nothing
right
not
all

for

nh
tasty
brew
i
dont
drink
many
dubbels
but
that
may
change
soon
cheers
glad
to
have
tried
this
as
i
work
through
various
examples
of
belgian
brews
d
decent
drinkable
dubbel
will
probably
get
this
one
again
yeasty
and
full
plenty
of
dark
sugary
malt
and
minimal
hop
balance
nutty
and
pleasant
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
recommend
it
without
the
stigma
of
the
dubbel
its
an
okay
belgian
dark
poured
into
a
grimbergen
chalice
a
nice
dark
brown
and
a
light
tan
tan
that
left
a
good
lacing
on
the
glass
very
small
aromas
of
sweet
coffee
it
had
a
good
sweet
taste
with
hints
of
caramel
coffee
and
slight
dark
fruit
it
is
a
tasty
beverage
that
is
very
non
offending
i
like
the
color
and
appearance
of
this
beer
the
nose
smell
isnt
that
pronounced
theres
nothing
bad
but
its
just
not
particularly
strong
either
kind
of
bland
in
the
smell
department
the
taste
is
good
though
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
typical
dubbel
if
you
ask
me
mouthfeel
is
good
i
dinged
it
a
bit
on
drinkability
because
of
the
sweetness
the
sweetness
makes
it
hard
to
have
several
of
them
aroma
from
the
beer
was
definitely
the
highlight
a
fairly
decent
dubbel
but
there
are
definitely
better
around
this
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
it
is
a
bit
light
for
a
dubbel
there
was
a
rich
sweet
malty
aroma
full
of
dark
fruits
the
flavor
is
equally
rich
with
good
malt
and
the
same
dark
fruits
the
after
taste
has
some
sweet
toffee
in
it
this
beer
has
fairly
high
carbonation
so
it
accentuates
the
flavors
and
tickles
my
tongue
it
has
a
medium
body
which
is
perfect
for
a
dubbel
the
drinkability
is
really
good
on
this
this
might
become
a
standard
for
me
pours
a
deep
translucent
mahogany
almost
cola
but
redder
in
color
short
creamy
head
tuirns
into
consistent
lacing
throughout
whiffs
of
yeastiness
and

taste
is
very
subtle
i
was
expecting
more
intense
flavors
from
this
but
still
was
enjoyable
heavy
yeasts
are
well
balanced
with
strong
malts
and
a
slight
sweetness
is
present
from
the
fermented
fruits
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
though
the
flavors
start
to
falter
in
balance
and
the
alcohols
and
rotting
fruit
flavors
are
more
prevalent
altogether
a
pretty
drinkable

this
one
has
a

of
complex
flavors
but
just
didn¬ít
seem
to
balance
well
all
over
the
place
this
was
a
good
but
not
great
beer
overall
impression
a
dry
spicy
wellknit
abbey
ale
nothing
off
but
nothing
wow
either
a
solid
offering
poured
this
beer
from
bottle
to
a
50
degree
tumbler
the
beer
had
a
nice
mahogany
color
with
a
big
fat
tan
head
that
smelled
a
little
like
caramel
bready
but
like
sour
dough
bread
that
went
sour
the
word
yuk
comes
to
mind
and
i
poured
this
beer
out
if
you
like
sour
beer
go
for
it
i
will
not
buy
again
pours
a
dark
burgandy
with
a
frothy
white
head
with
heavy
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
with
some
yeast
and
fruit
notes
the
taste
was
sweet
with
the
yeast
fruit
and
a
toffee
flavor
showing
through
this
one
has
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
it
has
a
smooth
finish
and
is
easy
to
enjoy
this
is
a
good
belgian
with
unique
flavors
and
characteristics
that
are
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
are
looking
for
something
a
little
bit
different
enjoy
not
what
i
would
expect
from
belgium
the
tinny
characteristic
while
mild
is
annoying
the
caramel
aspect
isnt
bad
but
seems
too
little
too
late
to
really
help
and
its
rather
onedimensional
to
boot
the
spiciness
that
i
expect
were
muted
while
its
true
that
it
is
at
a
fair
price
for
a
sixpack
ill
be
skipping
this
one
and
splurge
for
something
with
more
character
taste
is
not
exactly
what
most
people
look
for
in
a
dubbel
but
i
stand
by
my
judgement
its
amazingly
good
notes
of
creamy
malts
cola
apricot
persimmon
citrus
and
grape
a
hoppy
finish
balances
it
all
out
its
my
second
time
trying
this
beer
first
time
reviewing
and
it
has
withstood
my
developing
tastes
mouthfeel
is
juicy
and
crisp
with
a
perfect
carbonation
level
the
aftertase
while
not
immense
is
definately
present
overall
its
a
decently
complex
great
beer
perhaps
lacking
the
depth
of
most
dubbels
though
in
my
opinion
however
grimbergens
dubbel
is
better
tasting
than
most
certified
belgian
abbey
ales
dont
sleep
on
this
one
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
firm
beige
cap
displaying
some
nice
stick
aromas
of
earthy
malts
toasted
hops
and
slight
acidic
alcohol
esters
dominant
malt
profile
is
nutty
toasted
burnt
caramel
and
dates
yeast
is
earthy
and
mild
and
the
hops
has
virtually
faded
with
just
hints
of
a
light
herbal
spice
remaining
in
the
middle
brown
sugar
maple
syrup
sweetness
throughout
the
end
of
the
swill
displays
some
heavier
dark
fruit
character
and
then
moves
into
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
between
a
light
airiness
and
creamy
alcohol
and
metallic
tones
are
noticeable
but
not
degrading
da
i
was
shocked
to
find
this
at
my
local
convienence
store
here
in
nh
along
with
the
blonde
this
belgian
ale
is
highly
drinkable
and
might
be
the
first
authentic
belgian
abbey
ale
ive
ever
seen
in
a
local
market
here
in
southern
nh
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
this
stuff
for
a
long
time
to
come
poured
an
opaque
and
ruddy
dark
brown
head
was
small
and
tan
taken
to
the
nose
aromas
are
dark
fruits
like
grape
and
plum
yeast
some
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
bready
malt
taste
is
is
nice
mix
of
sweet
malt
chocolate
some
more
fruitiness
on
the
darkred
side
tinge
of
metallic
flavor
near
the
finish
there
is
some
noble
hop
bitterness
and
a
light
spice
in
the
finish
and
the
aftertaste
is
of
fruit
yeast
and
slight
steel
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
overall
a
nice
drinking
dubbel
didnt
wow
me
but
it
was
definatly
well
crafted
i
wold
love
to
find
this
on
tap
to
reveal
its
malty
nature
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
seems
to
be
a
decent
dubbel
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
served
a
bit
cold
on
tap
in
australia
having
had
nearly
all
the
trappist
dubbels
colors
my
notion
of
what
a
dubbel
is
supposed
to
be
this
is
a
good
beer
but
lacks
the
amazing
depth
of
character
that
i
look
for
in
an
abbey
ale
for
starters
the
grimbergen
product
is
lower
in
strength
than
most
abbey
dubbels
and
appeas
to
not
be
bottleconditioned
and
probably
filtered
even
so
this
beer
has
wonderfully
rich
malty
sweetness
and
full
body
and
satsfying
grainytoasty
notes
i
would
happily
serve
this
alongside
a
roast
leg
of
lamb
or
a
braised
beef
dish
im
glad
i
have
a
few
left
from
the
sixer
i
got
i
have
some
cooking
to
do
strongly
reminiscent
of
tilburgs
but
arguably
more
balanced
a
good
quaffer
but
nothing
to
rave
aboutyou
can
always
find
something
better
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
fine
belgian
dubbel
and
its
quite
reasonably
priced
drinkability
overall
a
pleasant
beer
worth
having
thanks
to
my
great
son
¬ìstudying¬î
overseas
in
amsterdam
i
was
sent
this
for
the
unique
chance
to
enjoy
drinkability
good
beer
that
has
been
worth
drinking
i
wont
be
coming
back
to
it
though
too
thin
and
too
nutty
but
a
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
i
was
impressed
by
it
because
it
was
just
a
quick
pick
and
then
head
home
to
ba
it
its
a
good
berr
for
when
you
want
to
take
it
easy
from
the
optimator
and
stone
ipa
drinkability
is
nice
no
real
alcohol
bite
at
all
which
is
surprising
for
even
its
abv
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
drinkability
is
very
good
the
flavor
balance
is
good
and
this
goes
down
easy
enough
to
enjoy
more
than
one
at
a
time
double
ale
pours
rubybrown
with
a
nice

that
last
pretty
much
through
the
entire
beer
has
sort
of
a
grainy
smell
nice
sweet
dark
taste
with
no
real
hint
of
alcohol
feels
very
thick
in
the
mouth
almost
chewable
then
the
aftertaste
kind
of
dries
it
up
decent
beer
all
in
all
still
a
good
beer
mediumheavy
bodied
definitely
a
sipping
beer
maybe
with
a
sweet
chocolate
desert
otherwise
something
for
after
dinner
thumbs
down
here
for
just
the
flavor
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
looking
and
tasting
beer
i
dont
think
id
reccommend
drinking
several
in
a
row
but
if
youd
like
a
nice
sipping
beer
that
is
almost
winelike
this
certainly
fits
the
bill
d
not
too
strong
for
a
dubbel
althought
it
isnt
extremely
dubbelish
it
still
tastes
really
great
to
me
i
would
drink
it
anytime
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
head
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
light
and
not
very
noticeable
the
taste
was
sour
and
alcoholic
also
slightly
malty
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
full
with
a
carbonation
kick
this
beer
feels
very
bright
and
explosive
in
your
mouth
id
say
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
id
love
to
hae
on
any
number
of
occasions
i
usually
order
this
at
my
favourite
belgian
restaurant
overall
a
nice
dubbel
not
an
everyday
drinker
but
recommended
nonetheless

this
poured
to
a
dark
red
plum
color
with
a
finger
thick
head
and
lots
of
lacing
even
smells
like
a
malty
plum
mmm
the
darn
puff
bar
my
wife
likes
served
it
to
cold
so
i
let
it
warm
a
bit
while
she
worked
on
the
martini
mouth
feel
was
light
i
thought
it
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
it
may
have
been
do
to
the
serving
temperature
taste
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruity
undertones
plum
and
granny
smith
apple
very
drinkable
wish
i
didnt
have
to
drive
home
or
i
would
have
had
another
note
i
was
a
little
worried
that
this
was
old
since
it
had
2001
printed
on
the
bottle
i
might
have
misread
the
code
though
it
certainly
tasted
as
if
it
still
had
several
more
years
left
in
it
mouthfeel
is
dry
but
quite
good
drinkability
is
also
nice
but
not
outstanding
for
a
dubbel
d
this
is
really
really
nice
its
not
my
favorite
dubbel
hi
westmalle
hi
chimay
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
excellent
beer
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
fruity
malty
sweet
comforting
opinion
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
am
a
little
more
used
to
a
dubbel
being
heavier
with
more
syrupiness
but
i
am
enjoying
the
light
balance
that
i
am
getting
from
this
beer
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
put
away
quite
a
few
of
these
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
when
poured
it
showed
a
medium
dark
brown
with
a
fine
layer
of
tan
foam
with
a
form
of
lace
on
the
side
of
my
glass
also
i
got
a
since
of
toasty
toffee
and
caramel
with
layer
of
soft
malts
and
hops
also
a
hint
of
spices
a
big
beer
without
being
heavy
very
well
balanced
overall
im
quite
impressed
with
this
stuff
it
has
better
than
expected
complexity
the
flavors
are
rich
and
strong
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
definitely
recommended
a
solid
brew
here
hefty
body
with
a
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
lets
itself
be
known
it
truly
seems
like
a
9abv
in
flavor
and
in
effect
a
good
drinking
strong
brew
that
suits
its
style
well
recommended
cheers
grimbergen
good
but
a
little
too
much
of
something
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
of
at
a
sitting
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
pale
biege
head
of
three
fingers
excellent
retention
that
leaves
rings
of
silky
lace
mild
aroma
raisins
and
plums
with
some
weak
belgian
phenols
taste
is
sweet
with
crystal
and
toasted
pale
malt
a
pinch
of
smoked
malt
and
mild
plum
esters
the
aftertaste
is
semidry
with
very
mild
indistinct
hops
the
low
carbonation
and
medium
body
allow
a
slickness
that
gradually
becomes
more
pronounced
which
detracts
form
drinkability
finishes
residual
and
mildy
fruity
this
is
a
decent
abbey
ale
but
a
far
cry
from
the
better
dubbels
that
are
more
widely
available
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
liking
but
otherwise
a
quality
beer
drinkability
like
i
said
i
cant
have
more
than
one
of
these
without
getting
sick
of
it
its
actually
more
like
a
tripel
with
dark
malt
influences
poured
into
a
grimbergen
glass
deep
brown
color
cola
looking
body
with
a
ruby
red
base
topped
by
a
thick
tan
head
with
good
staying
power
the
smell
is
caramely
and
toffeesweet
barelynoticable
alcohol
subtones
tastes
like
belguim
i
got
a
hint
of
fruit
or
berry
and
a
light
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
still
on
the
sweet
side
and
alcohol
is
a
bit
noticable
mouthfeel
is
suprisingly
lightbodied
a
bit
astringent
on
the
swallow
and
this
hinders
drinkability
a
bit
d
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
not
too
many
at
one
sitting
because
it
is
fairly
heavy
grimbergen
is
a
quality
beer
very
enjoyable
at
any
time
of
the
day
and
with
or
without
food
to
pair
it
with
not
a
bad
beer
and
worth
trying
i
think
that
this
is
a
clean
yet
very
unremarkable
double
ale
i
find
that
it
lacks
any
kind
of
real
distinction
other
than
it
is
true
to
style
my
only
regret
is
i
only
brought
home
one
750ml
corkedcaged
bottle
when
i
should
have
grabbed
2
especially
at
only
5
euro
each
overall
a
great
dubbel
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
tasting
presented
in
a
grimbergen
chalice
a
34
light
tan
head
over
the
barely
translucent
dark
brown
with
burgundy
highlights
brew
which
laces
heavily
light
doughy
aroma
with
spicy
highlights
taste
is
balanced
lightly
spiced
with
a
sedate
sweet
aftertaste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
good
as
well
worth
your
trouble
it
took
me
three
or
four
times
of
trying
this
beer
to
get
a
feel
for
it
i
finally
drank
it
in
a
duvel
tulip
and
that
seemed
to
help
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
head
leaving
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
dried
sweet
plums
and
other
tangy
fruits
has
a
true
belgian
tangy
dubbel
fruit
taste
really
interesting
was
overpriced
in
florida
but
since
moving
to
ohio
this
belgian
beer
is
a
new
favorite
and
reasonably
priced
last
thing
is
not
as
strong
as
most
belgians
and
can
be
used
as
a
session
brew
a
decent
balance
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
a
little
bit
of
a
harsh
woody
aftertaste
but
not
overwhelming
a
middle
of
the
road
dubbel
many
better
out
there
very
dry
fairly
mild
for
a
dubbel
hints
of
pepper
behind
seltzer
when
swirled
very
creamy
and
drinkable
best
when
warmer
and
held
in
the
mouth
12
ounce
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
half
finger
head
aroma
is
of
malt
plum
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
with
good
carbonation
taste
is
much
the
same
of
the
aroma
with
plenty
of
dark
fruits
and
malt
overall
a
tasty
beer
but
it
just
seems
like
something
is
missing
in
this
brew
overall
this
goes
down
pretty
smoothe
and
is
a
great
beer
considering
i
got
the
sixer
for
six
bucks
this
was
a
great
buy
ill
give
it
another
shot
real
soon
a
good
solid
beer
but
could
be
a
much
more
drinkable
one
if
the
carbonation
level
were
lowered
d
moderate
to
high
a
great
beer
easy
down
d
a
decent
dubbel
but
ive
had
better
could
be
a
bit
more
invigorating
belgian
beers
always
have
some
of
the
best
appearances
so
i
can
be
pretty
critical
about
them
even
if
they
are
better
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
this
poured
nicely
and
formed
a
decent
head
that
just
kind
of
fizzled
away
instead
of
breaking
apart
in
nice
bubbles
the
smell
was
average
for
a
dubble
it
had
very
carmel
maltlike
flavor
the
finished
with
a
semisweet
apple
flavor
that
was
balanced
between
sweet
and
dry
there
was
a
slight
metalic
flavor
i
was
not
too
fond
of
the
drinkablity
was
just
ok
all
in
all
there
was
not
much
that
stood
out
about
this
beer
i
wouldnt
discourage
it
but
you
can
find
better
paid
only
1
35
euro
for
a
bottle
pours
a
dark
mahogany
wood
stain
color
very
clear
good
head
that
dissipates
fast
smells
fantastic
candied
fruit
and
malt
the
smell
seems
to
drift
in
the
air
you
notice
this
one
from
a
distance
taste
is
good
again
candied
fruits
and
malt
with
a
bit
of
maple
syrup
and
some
astringentsugary
taste
lingering
behind
mouthfeel
is
ok
heavy
foam
bubble
but
not
too
sharp
drinkability
is
good
good
taste
good
price
notes
nice
price
for
an
imported
belgian
style
brew
i
consider
this
pretty
average
compared
to
other
dubbels
meaning
its
damn
tasty
heavily
towards
the
sweet
malted
and
of
course
that
distinct
belgian
smell
that
i
get
from
a
distinct
yeast
dissapointing
nahhhh
great
nahhhh
damn
fine
brew
yupp
a
good
belgian
just
what
i
was
looking
for
right
now
drinkability
very
drinkable
dubbel
more
so
because
of
the
incrdeible
mouthfeel
though
flavor
is
above
average
if
not
on
the
better
dubbels
ive
had
but
overall
its
a
real
nice
package
deal
very
drinkable
and
would
pair
with
many
things
due
to
it
mildness
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
i
do
know
of
many
better
versions
a
mild
tasting
example
of
the
beer
style
i
guess
there
are
some
that
would
seek
this
out
as
dubbels
go
this
is
definately
in
range
not
outstanding
nor
exceedingly
complex
but
quite
good
allaround
seems
a
bit
big
in
the
mouth
a
tad
too
sugary
but
nonetheless
a
solid
beer
this
beer
started
good
but
couldnt
keep
its
promise
a
pity
i
would
buy
this
again
aside
the
maes
family
sent
their
kids
to
intern
in
marketing
at
the
miller
brewery
hq
when
i
was
their
in
the
mid
80s
maybe
at
the
price
i
paid
this
is
the
holy
grail
that
said
it
cant
compare
with
the
topshelf
varieties
such
as
st
bernardus
prior
8
la
trappe
dubbel
or
even
maredsous
8
but
not
bad
for
middle
tier
pous
a
nice
dark
amber
body
with
good
head
and
very
nice
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
weak
aroma
of
spicey
fruit
taste
would
be
good
if
it
wasnt
for
a
strong
and
unexpected
grape
character
the
grape
really
throws
the
beer
as
without
it
itd
a
respectable
dubbel
and
while
it
has
nice
mouthfeel
the
grape
permeates
the
aftertaste
and
really
takes
the
fun
out
of
drinking
it
this
brew
is
my
favorite
pub
beer
recently
the
local
pub
i
go
to
lost
his
distributor
and
it
is
really
killing
me
deep
brown
on
the
pour
with
an
off
white
head
with
good
lacing
smells
sweet
with
malt
and
fruit
and
taste
the
same
with
a
neat
finish
not
as
complex
as
your
high
end
trappist
but
the
easiest
drinking
beer
i
have
ever
had
much
better
on
tap
btw
really
good
stuff
im
surprised
i
havent
reviewed
this
before
its
much
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
fruity
and
tart
in
the
aromas
lots
of
malt
raspberries
dates
figs
and
a
tad
of
chocolate
looks
moderately
thick
and
well
carbonated
a
lightly
tanned
head
accompanied
the
beer
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
tastes
much
like
it
smells
with
emphasis
on
dark
berry
sweetness
and
tartness
sweet
and
spicy
notes
decorate
the
heavy
malt
structure
feels
full
and
rich
without
being
thick
or
cloying
finishes
strong
and
sweet
maybe
a
little
tacky
and
dry
from
the
alcohol
worth
drinking
from
time
to
time
easily
drinkable
but
just
an
above
average
dubbel
its
got
all
of
the
necessary
ingredients
but
just
falls
short
of
being
among
the
top
tier
of
the
style
sampled
just
shy
of
a
pitcher
of
this
beer
tonight
it
poured
a
soild
dark
brown
color
with
nice
ruby
highlites
a
finger
of
off
white
head
sat
atop
the
beer
nose
was
nice
and
sweet
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
maple
syrup
with
back
notes
of
raisin
and
fig
flavor
was
dominated
with
sweet
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
maple
most
likely
from
dark
candied
sugar
in
harmony
with
some
special
b
flavor
follows
the
nose
in
being
brown
sugary
and
maple
sweet
with
raisin
notes
hanging
in
the
back
light
alcohol
notes
find
their
way
in
but
not
offensively
and
well
melded
feel
was
moderate
with
a
full
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
aroma
and
flavors
worked
well
together
seemed
to
be
missing
the
typical
belgian
spicey
chartacter
but
it
didnt
take
away
from
the
brew
a
beer
i
would
have
again
not
drinkable
because
it
is
just
not
likable
for
a
dubbel
this
beer
is
thin
and
lacking
flavor
even
if
i
set
aside
the
style
this
beer
is
not
tasty
if
i
had
a
750ml
i
would
dump
most
of
it
thankfully
all
i
have
is
an
11
2oz
bottle
i
will
finish
it
but
i
will
not
revisit
this
beer
again
for
a
dubbel
this
beer
is
lousy
as
a
¬ìbeer¬î
this
beer
is
lousy
too
i
never
heard
of
this
beer
before
i
seen
a
few
bottles
in
lawrence
ks
so
i
bought
one¬Ö
you
can
skip
it
though
it
has
a
soft
medium
body
lots
of
foam
and
fizz
tealike
aftertaste
a
little
bit
of
that
root
beer
thing
a
modest
dubbel
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
massive
tannish
head
lacing
is
absolutely
beautiful
smell
is
an
excellent
mixture
of
malt
and
dark
fruit
plums
prunes
raisins
dates
excellent
mixture
probably
the
biggest
dissapointment
ive
had
in
a
beer
after
the
terrific
smell
the
taste
leaves
much
to
be
desired
its
difficult
to
describe
the
fruits
are
still
there
but
they
taste
spoiled
no
enjoyment
at
all
hops
are
too
strong
and
the
balance
is
missing
not
very
drinkable
at
all
poured
a
dark
garnet
with
a
few
fingers
of
offwhite
head
nose
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
yeasty
mustiness
taste
is
sugary
sweet
candied
fruit
and
some
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
my
liking
overall
a
tasty
dubbel
very
drinkable
and
very
sweet
probably
not
for
everyone
but
worth
a
try
almost
a
dessert
beer
very
sweet
nearly
cloying
and
fruity
not
as
juicy
as
a
lambic
but
brings
that
to
mind
not
bad
not
great
brownish
red
in
color
with
dark

chocolate
caramel

of
the

on
the
sweet
side
earthy
and
with
plenty
of
fruit
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
and
creamy
and
fluffy
quite
pleasant
and
drinkable
one
of
the
better
dubbels
ive
had
recently
color
is
an
interesting
crimson
topped
with
a
decent
amount
of
foamy
tan

and
somewhat
caramely
but
not
particularly
assertive
taste
was
nice
up

malts
that
impart
a
light
chocolaty
taste
but
this
one
suffered
from
a
toowatery
mouthfeel
and
metallic
aftertastes
not
a
bad
beer
mind
you
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
a
very
drinkable
smooth
and
delectable
beer
most
enjoyable
ill
seek
out
a
few
more
of
these
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
darker
sweeter
beers
small
bottle
sampled
dating
on
the
label
but
not
sure
what
it
means
oh
well
maybe
if
i
spoke
flemish
this
one
pours
dark
almond
mahogony
fairly
clear
and
supports
a
dark
tan
head
which
is
showing
good
retention
leaves
some
stringy
and
scattered
lacing
aroma
of
dark
berries
fruit
and
some
rum
raisin
medium
bodied
belgian
lots
of
fruit
and
smoky
raisins
and
earthy
woodyness
picked
up
fairly
sweet
but
quite
drinkable
decent
if
not
spectacular
dubbel
lacks
the
bold
flavors
and
complexity
of
the
monsters
of
the
style
still
worth
a
try
good
beer
just
not
a
great
dubbel
a
bit
pricey
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
this
still
remains
a
very
easy
to
drink
dubble
its
not
an
every
day
beer
but
for
special
occasions
or
just
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
different
this
is
a
pretty
good
choice
nice
carbonation
a
noticable
creamy
mouthfeel
definitely
a
drinkable
belgium
double
and
unique
not
sure
how
crazy
i
am
about
it
though
if
youre
new
to
the
dubbel
style
youd
probably
be
wise
to
start
elsewhere
this
bier
pours
a
nice
cloudy
brownish
color
and
it
came
violently
out
of
its
bottle
an
into
my
glass
probably
from
health
fermentation
in
the
bottle
it
has
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
tons
of
lace
and
it
lasts
until
the
glass
is
empty
it
has
a
nice
fruity
estery
yeasty
aroma
that
is
quite
complex
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
and
it
sometimes
overpowers
the
experience
it
certainly
is
drinkable
and
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
a
non
trappist
dubbel
so
on
one
hand
i
am
surprised
and
on
the
other
i
ask
myself
if
it
is
worth
the
price
i
had
to
pay
for
a
six
pack
13
i
say
not
when
there
are
far
superior
dubbels
to
choose
from
but
if
you
want
something
that
comes
close
and
will
get
you
drunk
faster
than
a
40
of
something
bad
and
there
is
nothing
else
better
to
be
had
then
this
beer
will
do
ok
probably
the
worst
dubbel
i
can
remember
having
this
showed
up
in
my
local
beer
store
this
week
so
i
grabbed
a
single
to
try
i
really
didnt
expect
much
and
i
was
right
thin
watery
with
a
strange
aftertaste
i
had
it
with
dinner
but
didnt
finish
it
ive
certainly
had
worse
beers
but
there
are
too
many
great
examples
of
this
style
to
settle
for
this
one
if
you
can
find
the
loterbol
you
can
see
what
a
great
dubbel
should
taste
like
or
of
course
the
westy
or
westmalle
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
shadowy
brownish
rust
color
the
head
is
a
thick
creamy
tan
foam
i
really
appreciated
this
aroma
sugar
and
malt
slight
ethanol
fruit
plums
and
an
intense
meaty
literally
yeastiness
the
taste
has
a
lingering
sweetness
and
a
round
fruitiness
that
fit
the
beer
well
nice
malt
flavor
as
well
peppery
finish
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
estery
and
yeasty
beer
my
wife
didn¬ít
like
it
for
those
reasons
but
i
thought
that
it
hit
the
spot
33
cl
bottle
coded

pours
a
nice
muddied
burgundy
shade
with
a
fluffy
greyishbeige
head
dark
roasted
candi
sugars
and
belgian
special
b
malts
with
some
fruity
esters
similar
to
candied
cherries
and
a
distinct
woody
sourness
present
in
the
nose
malty
and
sugary
sweet
with
a
lightly
hoppy
and
sour
finish
light
tealike
astringency
and
faint
flemish
red
sourness
is
quite
unique
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
dubbel
fruity
esters
abound
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
one
of
these
and
im
glad
i
decided
to
grab
one
when
i
saw
it
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
enjoy
now
if
i
could
only
find
their
tripel
taste
more
of
those
same
flavors
from
the
nose
here
in
the
flavor
dark
fruits
aplenty
deep
and
plentiful
this
is
a
nice
double
but
not
in
the
realm
of
the
transcendent
nutty
fruity
dark
and
just
a
little
yummy
fullbodied
with
a
long
fruity
finish
a
nice
drinker
easy
going
id
recommend
it
but
not
over
any
other
dubbel
plenty
of
other
tasty
beers
out
there
id
urge
you
to
acquaint
you
with
them
and
not
to
worry
about
this
one
ive
tried
it
time
to
move
on
to
the
next
pours
a
rich
brownish
amber
with
a
monsterous
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
warming
brown
sugar
presence
with
a
malt
hint
flavor
is
a
pretty
standard
for
a
dubbel
hints
of
toffee
and
raisin
overall
not
spectacular
but
a
great
example
of
a
dubbel
the
flavors
involved
were
very
average
fruits
do
come
out
in
the
fairly
sweet
smell
the
taste
was
mostly
of
malts
with
some
degree
of
fruit
the
mouthfeel
was
a
touch
too
thin
although
the
drinkability
was
good
poured
from
11
2
oz
squat
bottle
labeled

pours
a
clear
deep
dark
burgundy
with
a
dense
frothy
ecru
head
that
leaves
sticky
lace
on
the
chalice
yeast
and
fruits
in
the
nose
taste
is
plum
fruits
less
of
malts
and
sweet
grape
sweeter
as
it
warmed
moderate
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
easy
drinking
looks
like
a
cup
of
really
dark
iced
tea
with
a
medium
brown
body
semitranslucent
with
a
creamy
tan
head
smells
stickysweet
with
hints
of
bubblegum
and
raisins
and
sweet
citrus
taste
is
rich
and
malty
with
strong
raisin
and
bread
flavors
that
give
it
a
somewhat
grainy
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
present
but
not
evasive
a
very
good
beer
and
a
welcome
price
for
a
bottle
of
belgian
beer
this
brew
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
that
disappeared
pretty
fast
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
but
there
is
a
hint
of
sour
fruit
at
times
as
well
mediumbodied
with
a
vinous
character
malt
hops
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
don¬ít
seem
to
mesh
well
for
some
reason
the
flavor
is
decent
but
unbalanced
somehow
the
finish
is
fruity
and
sweet
overall
a
decent
dubbel
but
i
feel
it
could
be
much
better
attractive
mahogany
brown
body
with
a
sandy
foam
head
that
fades
into
a
grainy
satelite
photo
of
a
hurricane
eye
and
all
the
aroma
and
flavor
start
off
slight
with
mostly
a
bit
of
yeast
and
toffee
but
near
the
end
of
the
glass
you
start
picking
up
a
bit
of
artificial
grape
candy
and
at
the
very
end
that
grape
candy
starts
to
pick
up
a
bit
of
vinegar
not
bad
but
not
great

with

a
rather
simple
dubbel
that
grew
on
me
its
clean
in

to
esters

phenols

sits
softly
on
the
palate
middling
in

highly
drinkable

a

at
one
point
i
am
sure
i
tasted
green
table
grapes
hmmm
seems
a
bit
lacking
in
body
for
a
dubbel
a
bit
of
wellbalanced
acidity
on
the
finish
however
it
certainly
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
would
be
a
good
starter
for
those
interested
in
stepping
into
the
world
of
belgian
beersperhaps
from
the
nut
brown
realm
price
is
nice
could
this
be
the
the
belgians
searching
for
a
beer
more
favorable
to
the

a
quickly
dissipating

with

is

but
not
spectacular

is
fairly
light
with
a
good

very
cool

it
also
seemed
a
bit
plain
even
with
the
little
nuances
being
picked
up
nothing
really
stands
out
miraculously
subtle
but
was
missing
the
fruity
snap
and
character
i
like
to
see
in
a
dubble
something
seems
off
or
unbalanced
but
what
is
implies
an
undiscernable
impression
feel
is
quite
smooth
full
and
creamy
frothy
textured
malty
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
some
slight
dullishlike
drying
id
have
this
again
no
doubt
the
numbers
dont
show
how
much
i
actually
liked
it
a
bit
different
and
slightly
off
for
what
ive
come
to
know
as
a
good
dubble
for
my
tastes
but
wait
i
thought
it
was
good
so
i
guess
it
is
the
beer
as
it
sets
in
the
glass
a
dark
amber
to
brown
color
with
a
modest
and
somewhat
creamy
head
that
is
light
tan

the
resultant

of

other
dubbels
that
i
tend
to
like
more
is
it
worth
the
money
perhaps
perhaps
not
it
may
be
better
suited
with

that
matched
it

counter
the

the
flavor
was

in

to
a
true
belgina
dubbel
this
one
has
a
more
intense
flavor
more
like
a
quad
and
perhaps
is
slightly
less
aromatic
brought
the
bottle
back
from
oklahoma
city
a
year
ago
poured
in
a
chalice
lost
an
ounce
on
the
floor
as
this
is
a
gusher
minimal
head
quickly
disappeared
aroma
of
raisins
figs
dark
malt
caramel
moderate
carbonation
full
moutfeel
overall
quite
tasty
notes
of
raisins
caramel
dark
malts
galangal
root
and
a
subtle
alcohol
warmth
as
it
warms
up
more
melon
rind
notes
appear
small
sediment
floaties
at
the
end
nice
complexity
and
flavors
o
a
very
good
and
fairly
complex
representation
of
the
style
if
you
are
looking
for
a
dubbel
with
a
little
something
extra
then
this
beer
wont
disappoint
at
all
yet
another
quality
effort
from
the
little
brewery
from
ok
o
a
good
dubbel
brewed
in
ok
try
it
out
overall
a
surprisingly
good
dubbel
from
oklahoma
more
thoroughbred
belgianlovers
will
notice
the
differences
but
this
beer
is
all
about
the
malt
complexity
offering
a
surprising
and
highly
enjoyable
beer
i
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thicker
one
of
my
favorite
aspects
of
the
quaddubbel
genre
is
that
velvety
consistency
apart
from
that
though
this
beer
is
well
executed
overall
a
really
good
belgian
style
dubbel
from
a
local
american
brewery
highly
recommended

review

looks
like
belgium
has
indeed
come
to
the
land
of
the
sooners
right
on
this
bit
of
evidence
pours
a
deep
sunset
rubyauburn
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
clove
raisin
rye
bread
banana
fig
dark
toffee
light
nutmeg
and
a
nice
undercurrent
of
cocoa
the
taste
holds
notes
of
clove
banana
peel
light
orange
peel
brown
sugar
black
pepper
nutmeg
dry
caramel
and
lightlytoasted
wheat
bread
the
toastedness
and
spices
really
come
through
powerfully
taking
out
much
of
the
rest
luckily
enough
remains
for
things
to
nearly
balance
out
unfortunately
i
dont
get
the
cocoa
anymore
shame
really
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
morethansolid
dubbel
one
that
belgium
would
be
proud
to
have
birthed
herself
this
is
a
staple
december
beer
in
my
house
bold
flavors
that
are
delicately
interweaved
very
well
done
o
i
think
this
is
the
first
dubbel
i
have
tasted
at
least
that
i
can
remember
i
enjoyed
it
i
dont
really
have
another
dubbel
to
compare
this
too
but
i
liked
it
so
i
will
give
it
a
b
the
nose
brings
a
bit
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
some
bread
crust
there
as
well
faint
pepper
and
phenolic
the
dark
fruit
character
is
fairly
mild
though
id
say
it
is
the
most
dominant
the
flavor
adds
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
pepper
dark
fruits
throughout
medium
body
with
fair
carbonation
light
alcohol
presence
fairly
dry
in
the
finish
as
well
after
a
semisweet
palate
pretty
decent
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
o
dont
like
this
take
on
a
dubbel
too
thin
malty
boozy
and
carbonated
its
not
like
its
horrible
but
i
find
it
a
poor
and
weird
example
of
the
style
or
a
bad
take
on
it
drinkability
overall
drinkable
but
not
sure
it
would
be
my
first
choice
the
alcohol
content
is
8
but
didnt
feel
overpowering
to
me
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
weak
but
that
might
be
just
my
opinion
the
fruity
smell
and
taste
while
a
bit
strong
at
the
beginning
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
the
biggest
drawback
for
me
was
the
amount
of
carbonation
every
drink
felt
much
too
fizzy
in
my
mouth
and
made
it
a
bit
disappointing
even
though
the
taste
was
fine
onicely
done
dubbel
got
this
bomber
for
2
98
in
the
closeout
barrel
drinkability
the
alcohol
in
this
seems
higher
than
eight
percent
to
me
but
what
do
i
know
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
though
the
amount
of
sweetness
that
crosses
that
palate
was
a
bit
much
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
fruit
profile
which
i
wouldnt
change
but
id
lower
the
alcohol
thin
out
the
body
mostly
in
carbonation
and
i
think
this
would
be
a
more
drinkable
beer
o
it
seems
like
this
brew
doesnt
have
enough
of
the
belgian
characteristics
to
be
a
great
dubbel
and
it
seems
to
lack
body
this
is
a
fine
enough
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
its
one
of
the
better
dubbels
brewed
on
this
side
of
the
pond
while
i
cant
say
its
on
par
with
chimay
rouge
or
st
bernardus
prior
8
its
a
quality
dubbel
none
the
less
props
to
the
folks
north
of
the
border
for
crafting
a
tasty
brew
excelent
variation
of
a
belgiandubbel
poured
a
good
head
with
a
good
dark
amber
almost
burbon
color
this
beer
had
a
plesant
aroma
tasted
well
and
left
with
little
bitter
after
tase
highly
recomended
excelent
progress
on
the
part
of
oklahoma
based
choc
brewery
i
pretty
bad
dubbel
i
cant
recommend
unless
your
ticking
ok
dry
and
drinkable
yet
semicomplex
and
a
dryish
malt
bomb
nice
for
a
change
to
have
a
dubbel
that
does
not
rely
on
that
typical
sweet
alcoholic
combo
it
rivals
its
belgian
counterparts
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
alcohol
toffee
and
raisins
the
flavor
is
very
heavy
on
the
dark
fruit
specifically
raisins
i
also
get
some
apples
belgian
candi
sugar
toffee
and
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
to
high
carbonation
a
wellcrafted
dubbel
d
pretty
average
overall
too
thin
not
carbonated
enough
lacks
the
character
i
expect
in
a
dubbel
for
this
to
have
goldmedaled
it
must
have
been
a
bad
year
for
dubbels
d
ive
liked
the
majority
of
beers
that
ive
had
from
these
guys
but
this
one
was
a
miss
oh
well
you
cant
win
them
all
this
is
a
little
lighter
than
some
of
the
better
known
dubbels
out
there
but
is
welldone
especially
the
aroma
easily
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
choc
and
would
be
happy
to
drink
again
edit
a
few
months
later
i
have
continued
to
buy
this
beer
its
continued
to
be
great
theres
yet
another
bottle
in
my
fridge
at
this
very
moment
still
really
impressed
such
a
great
brew
came
from
ok
o
decent
selection
ill
be
interested
in
trying
more
from
this
brewery
poured
into
a
westmalle
chalice
a
dark
amber
with
a
very
thin
head
the
scent
is
very
strong
of
grapfruit
notes
and
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
also
strong
a
rather
nice
suprise
lots
of
carmeled
malted
front
end
some
of
that
grapefruit
flavor
is
in
there
also
with
some
raisin
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
the
style
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
pours
to
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
hazy
amberred
color
aroma
is
complex
fruity
and
spicy
with
caramel
vanilla
and
fruit
notes
flavor
is
belgian
all
the
way
with
fruity
and
malty
flavors
dominating
with
some
malt
sweetness
balanced
by
the
hops
and
the
drying
effect
of
the
8
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
effervescent
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
technically
flawless
and
totally
above
reproach
drinkability
when
i
think
of
the
best
an
abbey
dubbel
has
to
offer
i
seriously
doubt
chocs
offering
will
immediately
spring
to
mind
this
one
just
didnt
have
the
desired
body
and
stayed
sweet
til
the
end
still
its
okay
i
guess
and
works
in
a
pinch
especially
in
oklahoma
this
beer
pours
an
amberbrown
color
the
head
is
three
inches
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
star
anise
spice
box
dark
fruit
and
plums
this
is
a
very
interesting
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
is
a
lot
of
nice
spice
and
enough
malt
to
balance
things
out
without
getting
cloying
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
vigorous
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
dubbel
22
ounce
bomber
as
part
of
my
haul
from
midtown
in
tulsa
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
minimal
bubbly
head
that
quickly
fades
away
smells
of
fruitcake
and
other
spice
nutmeg
clove
kind
of
like
christmas
in
a
bottle
taste
is
of
fruitcake
and
figs
slight
malt
character
and
sweetness
in
the
finish
with
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
further
sips
yield
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
cherry
needs
more
malt
character
to
balance
out
how
sweet
it
is
its
highly
carbonated
but
has
a
disappoiting
body
for
a
beer
this
tasty
decent
example
of
a
belgian
dubbel
may
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
some
palates
nice
to
see
choc
expand
their
offerings
nothing
too
crazy
about
this
beer
just
a
for
the
most
part
well
made
to
style
dubbel
pours
a
dark
mahoganyamber
with
a
retentive
bubbly
light
brown
head
aroma
is
a
sweet
rich
toasted
blend
of
malts
fruity
esters
yeast
and
sugars
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
initially
sweet
with
caramel
malt
raisin
and
plum
before
a
slightly
more
toasted
malt
and
spicy
finish
medium
bodied
with
slightly
aggressive
sharp
carbonation
producing
a
relatively
dry
clean
finish
not
quite
the
class
of
the
style
but
an
excellent
american
interpretation
i
would
enjoy
having
this
as
a
local
ok
im
starting
to
come
around
a
little
bit
this
beer
has
more
to
offer
than
metallic
taste
though
i
still
cant
get
past
that
flavor
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
on
the
same
level
as
a
true
belgian
dubbel
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
enjoyable
but
not
as
good
as
an
authentic
id
say
its
still
worth
a
try
though
pretty
drinkable
and
solid
overall
well
what
do
you
know
a
belgian
dubbel
from
oklahoma
and
its
not
even
half
bad
crazy
very
solid
and
worth
a
try
though
it
is
not
among
my
favorites
of
the
style
or
chocs
signature
series
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
maybe
just
a
hair
on
the
syrupy
side
with
a
light
tingling
carbonation
that
really
works
well
nice
and
tasty
quite
drinkable
drinkability
despite
the
required
abv
for
the
style
this
is
certainly
easy
enough
to
drink
and
i
find
that
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
way
to
go
krebs
brewing
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
deserves
its
acclaim
only
strength
of
flavor
and
conservative
dryness
keeps
it
from
rivaling
chimay
red
and
rochefort

thanks
again
blueokie
noted
rereviewed
the
same
batch
a
few
months
later
and
the
carbonationmouthfeel
has
really
improved
with
the
additional
conditioning
time
ill
continue
to
enjoy
this
beer
over
the
next
year
as
long
as
its
still
around
as
i
think
it
will
continue
to
improve
drank
really
easy
for
the
style
not
spot
on
but
damn
close
artfully
executed
i
will
happily
buy
many
of
these
to
send
as
extras
in
trades
nice
for
me
to
finally
see
something
besides
their
biere
de
garde
i
can
crow
about
from
oklahoma
there
are
some
good
draft
beers
as
well
fantastic
value
for
6
a
bottle
this
one
needs
to
start
at
cellar
temp
not
any
cooler
a
very
good
offering
from
choc
was
excited
to
pick
up
a
bottle
and
this
is
definately
going
to
be
one
i
pick
up
often
since
it
is
a
local
its
also
a
great
value
at
around
5
bucks
for
a
22oz
bomber
for
the
money
and
the
taste
i
can
see
myself
picking
this
over
some
of
my
other
belgianstyle
favorites
ugh
unfortunate
volcano
effect
as
i
lost
a
good
deal
of
the
bottle
upon
opening
this
is
a
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
dark
brown
to
black
color
fizzy
and
well
carbonated
obvious
after
the
eruption
smell
is
very
sweet
a
combination
of
candy
sugar
and
grapes
taste
is
sweet
as
well
with
more
sweet
dark
grape
juice
pears
and
other
fruits
fairly
light
bodied
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
d
what
an
excellent
surprise
id
never
heard
of
this
brewery
before
last
week
and
now
im
totally
eager
to
try
more
from
them
subdued
sweetness
and
subtle
spiciness
plus
no
hint
of
alcohol
make
for
an
exceptional
experience
drinkable
and
a
very
nice
offering
from
choc
great
carbonation
and
appearance
perfected
for
what
it
is
overall
really
nice
dubbel
glad
this
one
is
made
locally
which
means
i
can
get
a
great
belgian
for
5
50
a
bomber
score
hv
oh
yeah
let
this
one
warm
up
people
d
good
i
will
enjoy
every
bit
of
this
bomber
myself
looks
smells
tastes
more
or
less
as
a
dubbel

amber
golden
body
with
some
white
head

yeast
and
tads
of
lace
medium
plus
mouthfeel
creamy

double
belgian

you
know
taste
was
hasher
in
first
half
of
body
a
spoton
dubbel
though
harsher
aggressive
on
palate
really
at
least
at
first
than
i
would
have
thought
drinkability
this
was
not
a
bad
dubbel
its
was
a
descent
one
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
was
overall
pleasantly
surprised
with
complexities
and
by
far
my
favorite
to
come
from
petes
place
so
far
a
pretty
good
dubbel
surprisingly
good
especially
for
a
brewery
in
oklahoma
no
off
flavors
whatsoever
definitely
worth
a
try
very
solid
and
spot
on
dubbel
a
very
good
american
version
of
the
belgian
classic

a
hint

strain
very
clean
tasting
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
smooth
carbonation
super
drinkable
for
8
abv
i
am
definately
buying
this
again
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
for
sure
drinkability
a
decent
beer
fairly
solid
all
around
and
with
wellhidden
alcohol
thats
of
a
reasonable
level
for
the
style
id
cut
down
on
the
medicinal
phenols
on
this
one
let
the
sweetness
and
the
fruity
flavors
shine
through
and
itd
be
a
definite
winner
as
ive
said
before
i
may
be
a
little
biased
since
this
is
a
local
brewery
but
you
cant
go
wrong
with
these
brews
and
nobody
ive
talked
to
about
them
has
been
dissapointed
seek
em
out
and
enjoy

eloquent
balance
found
this
in
a
gift
pack
of
belgian
ales
at
world
market
around
christmas
time
very
good
example
of
the
dubbel
ale
style
abv
of
8
but
drinks
very
smoothly
would
definitely
recommend
and
drink
again
full
bodied
and
flavored
dubbel
with
a
nice
tartness
and
old
ale
sweetness
like
most
ales
this
could
also
be
served
by
tilting
the
glass
and
avoiding
carbonation
to
be
released
in
that
case
this
beer
might
taste
stronger
this
review
was
based
on
a
strong
pour
and
not
much
carbonation
left
in
the
beer
a
preferable
pour
based
on
this
style
of
dubbels
to
my
opinion
overall
a
good
double
but
not
a
great
one
it
has
good
flavor
but
just
seems
a
bit
weak
feels
a
bit
watered
down
compared
the
the
best
of
this
style
where
the
competition
is
very
stiff
it
cant
quite
stand
up
to
the
big
boys
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
a
medium

aroma
and
taste

tartness
belgian

with
a
lingering
moderate

and

dark

ending
aroma
seemed
a
bit
light
overall
a
well
balanced
and
flavorful
brew
o
really
great
tasting
dubbel
if
anything
its
a
little
too
straight
shooting
with
out
a
huge
depth
regardless
i
really
like
this
for
the
smooth
mellow
drinkability
serving
type
bottle
o
ive
passed
this
by
so
many
times
before
actually
trying
it
and
its
a
shame
i
did
this
is
a
really
solid
dubbel
it
has
a
lot
more
going
on
than
i
would
have
expected
and
all
the
flavors
are
pronounced
yet
balanced
well
and
play
off
each
other
nicely
definitely
pick
this
up
and
give
it
a
go
the
one
thing
i
do
notice
that
brings
it
down
some
is
that
buttery
taste
in
here
its
just
a
hint
too
much
but
not
extremely
overboard
meh
a
passable
belgium
but
not
something
ill
seek
out
overall
a
darker
dubbel
with
more
roasted
flavors
then
i
was
anticipating
especially
at
the
end

odd
but
nice

it

this
one
doesnt
match
up
to
the
best
dubbels
out
there
but
its
a
decent
beer
in
and
of
itself
besides
that
great
head
retention
nothing
else
particularly
special
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
it
is
tasty
bornems
dubbel
is
enjoyable
and
refreshing
could
easily
be
substituted
where
champagne
would
otherwise
be

one
would
be
great
with

thick
on

slightly
more
bitter
in

overall
this
is
a
good
solid
dubbel
and
has
obviously
been
crafted
by
brewers
with
years
of
experience
this
is
a
very
good
beer
like
the
others
from
this
brewery
attention
to
every
detail
is
paid
to
this
beer
it
may
not
be
your
taste
but
it
certainly
wont
disappoint
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
it
seems
that
i
am
actually
liking
their
lower
gravity
beers
more
than
their
bigger
ones
gulden
draak
is
good
but
not
my
favorite
but
ranks
higher
than
this
beer
i
would
say
that
this
brewery
definitely
knows
how
to
make
a
quality
beer
as
long
as
you
can
get
a
fresh
example
which
i
obviously
have
with
this
variety
pack
i
may
prefer
other
examples
of
this
style
if
they
were
all
at
the
same
arms
reach
but
this
is
a
solid
offering
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
again

had
to
knock
it

would
fit
perfectly
for
that

was
a
welcome
suprise
in
the
dubbel
style
a
new
beer
and
was
easy
to
drink
o
near
or
above
average
for
a
belgian
dubbel
i
e
very
good
o
a
solid
dubbel
dubbel
is
a
category
i
tend
to
grade
very
strongly
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
efforts
ive
had
weird
to
think
i
havent
had
this
in
about
5
years
well
worth
the
revisit
a
decent
dubbel
maybe
a
little
on
the
dry
side
which
is
aok
with
me
as
nothing
is
out
of
balance
on
the
whole
not
overly
complex
but
drinkable
enough
for
this
doubting
thomas
acolyte
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
got
it
in
a
sampler
pack
and
this
is
one
of
the
first
that
didnt
wholly
disappoint
well
rounded
good
flavors
supported
by
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
very
drinkable
d
very
good
but
the
alcohol
will
catch
up
with
you
fast
overall
this
was
a
beer
that
surpassed
my
expecation
as
frankly
wasnt
expecting
much
but
this
is
a
good
entrant
into
the
category
one
that
i
would
gladly
revisit
this
brew
pours
out
like
a
pretty
typical
belgian
dubbel
the
color
is
a
muddy
looking
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
of
earth
and
some
darker
fruits
are
picked
up
in
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
funk
too
the
taste
is
surprisingly
different
than
some
dubbels
out
there
i
kept
picking
up
some
type
of
sourness
in
the
flavor
almost
like
it
was
aged
in
oak
or
something
not
the
standard
flavor
for
most
dubbels
i
can
see
how
some
may
enjoy
this
but
i
wasnt
really
digging
it
overall
it
might
have
just
a
touch
too
much
carbonation
but
it
is
still
an
above
average
beer
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
it
had
a
nice
taste
not
sure
id
pick
it
up
again
but
im
happy
i
tried
it
overall
the
beer
had
a
good
pour
and
an
interesting
aroma
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
never
showed
up
to
the
party
d
goes
down
really
smoothly
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
but
its
a
little
too
sweet
d
i
suppose
this
could
be
ranked
fairly
high
due
to
the
light
body
and
high
carbonation
but
the
flavor
fall
short
of
the
nosestyle
and
the
mouthfeel
isnt
what
i
enjoy
out
of
great
dubbels
i
cant
imagine
buying
this
again
pours
a
deep
reddish
mahogany
with
a
tall
retentive
head
that
will
knock
your
socks
off
i
poured
equal
head
to
beer
at
a
headreducing
angle
and
had
to
wait
a
while
in
order
to
top
off
my
glass
tastes
of
ripened
fruits
candy
some
esters
and
a
hint
of
caramel
round
out
this
dubbel
nicely
smooth
moderate
body
and
sweet
through
the
swallow
while
wet
in
the
finish
leaves
your
tongue
sweating
for
another
drink
an
experienced
craft
well
worthy
of
an
evenings
enjoyment
d
this
was
light
for
a
dubbel
very
easy
to
drink
ill
take
one
more
d
ehh
id
choose
most
other
dubbels
over
this
one
d
very
drinkable
kind
of
easy
and
fresh
jd
final
thoughts
all
in
all
an
above
average
dubbel
not
quite
as
good
as
the
trappist
offering
ive
had
but
given
the
right
price
i
could
enjoy
this
in
their
stead
give
it
a
shot
d
a
solid
dubbel
that
i
would
pick
up
again

but
good

maybe
with
apple
or
cherry
pie
dactually
a
really
good
smooth
dubbel
the
abv
i
wouldve
guessed
to
be
half
of
what
it
is
id
like
to
have
more
of
this
11
2
oz
snubby
duvel
style
bottle
into
a
snifter
darker
than
expected
this
is
a
dark
one
even
for
a
dubbel
head
just
keeps
climbing
and
climbing
ive
poured
entire
22
oz
chugs
into
this
snifter
and
this
dubbel
surged
almost
all
the
way
to
the
top
traditional
hops
and
belgian
pils
malt
and
caramel
malt
and
smoked
malt
come
through
much
more
than
the
yeast
which
i
find
to
be
the
dominant
flavor
in
many
dubbels
still
quite
a
good
funkiness
from
the
yeast
though
its
surprisingly
light
and
spritzy
on
the
tongue
its
also
quite
sweet
i
would
say
a
little
underbalanced
on
the
hop
side
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
does
it
compete
with
any
of
the
trappist
dubbels
not
quite
but
you
wont
be
sorry
you
tried
one
or
two
either
drinkabilty
kind
of
a
odd
flavor
for
a
dubbel
its
not
what
i
expect
but
overall
its
decent
has
enough
alcohol
to
were
1
or
2
is
good
i
prefer
spice
and
malt
heavy
dubbels
over
this
i
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
seek
out
medium
body
maybe
a
little
bit
more
not
bad
but
sometimes
a
bit
weird
or
off
yet
not
in
a
very
bad
way
interesting
curious
but
not
fascinating
drinkability
a
little
toned
down
for
the
style
making
this
a
not
too
bad
session
beer
the
alcohol
could
be
better
hidden
d
meh
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
measure
but
certainly
not
my
first
choice
an
underwhelming
brew
d
it
is
honestly
too
drinkable
for
the
beer
style
i
expected
it
to
be
something
i
can
relax
with
and
sip
slowly
d
good
but
not
great
an
average
example
of
a
dubbel
im
straining
to
pick
up
much
of
anything
from
the
nose
definitely
a
bit
of
yeast
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
big
whiffs
the
taste
is
dark
fruits
and
belgian
yeast
character
up
front
which
gives
way
to
a
light
roastiness
in
the
surprisingly
dry
finish
a
bit
too
thin
and
too
highly
carbonated
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
hides
its
abv
quite
well
but
is
not
really
anything
to
write
home
about
highly
drinkable
i
would
gladly
drink
again
not
the
best
dubbel
out
there
but
worth
a
try
nose
is
bready
hint
of
minerals
and
plums
very
light
belgian
yeast
esters
taste
is
similarly
light
on
what
i
would
call
the
belgian
yeast
profile
more
bready
and
caramel
quite
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
almost
bordering
on
chalky
in
the
mouth
light
cola
sweetness
light
phenols
perhaps
a
touch
too
much
carbonation
borderline
too
thin
mouthfeel
no
sight
of
the
abv
yet
everything
about
this
screams
average
or
just
above
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
specifically
d
a
good
example
of
the
dubbel
style
which
didnt
blow
me
away
but
earned
my
respect
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
but
would
also
be
fine
living
without
it
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
at
least
once
also
the
7
is
pretty
hard
to
pick
up
on
this
is
an
easy
drinker
very
light
body
good
carbonation
overall
the
flavour
level
is
quite
light
for
a
dubbel
due
to
the
lightness
and
the
well
hidden
alcohol
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
not
to
fancy
but
a
solid
drinkable
dubbel
purchased
as
bought
of
a
6
bottle
pack
from
the
control
board
in
ontario
pours
an
amberbrown
colour
with
huge
pillowly
head
with
some
lacing
smells
of
dried
fruit
and
caramel
flavour
is
pretty
mild
for
the
style
huge
carbonation
level
just
an
ok
dubbel
ive
preferred
the
other
beers
from
this
pack
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
nose
brings
some
bread
caramel
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
booze
the
taste
combines
the
elements
quite
well
with
some
dark
fruits
and
a
good
amount
of
lighter
belgian
yeast
characteristics
medium
creamy
mouthfeel
not
fantastic
but
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
a
fine
beer
d
would
not
reccomend
this
to
someone
to
try
for
their
first
dubbel
there
are
better
examples
out
there
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
again
kind
of
a
waste
you
can
tell
that
the
brewers
dumped
a
ton
of
caramelized
sugar
in
this
its
gross
avoid
it
wud
echo
todd
of
the
bros
on
the
sharp
chesse
though
nice
pairing
idea
d
it
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
this
beer
because
the
alcohol
is
completely
masked
and
the
amount
of
sweetness
is
subdued
pour
release
of
maple
syrup
then
a
nice
earth
and
brown
sugar
molasses
bittered
and
not
powerfully
sweet
a
nice
character
no
abv
evident
and
a
nice
coinciding
quality
of
ester
and
sweetness
a
dry
tingle
clean
on
the
tongue
and
not
syrupy
only
dubbel
ive
had
that
tastes
better
as
it
sits
expands
warms
a
very
approachable
dubbel
it
hides
its
alcohol
well
the
flavour
is
wellcontained
if
not
a
little
subdued
but
well
worth
revisiting
not
very
full
so
you
could
drink
several
without
being
too
full
pours
a
thick
light

fivefingered

poured

formed

are

by

ca
its

the
smell

became

pronounced

it
warmed
a
bit
an
assortment
of
fruit
flavors
swims
around
nicely
with
notes
of
plum

cherry
its
definitely
a
sweet
one
that
rounds
out
an
evening
nicely
pours
a
dark
reddish
colour
topped
by
a
very
impressive
thick
and
creamy
head
the
colour
of
the
head
is
light
brown
which
adds
to
the
overall
appearance
of
this
dubbel
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
good
carbonation
with
strong
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beautiful
dubbel
not
as
ragingly
spicy
as

not

notes
as

than

it
melts
in

with

taste
with

perfect
for
an
after

drink
very
nice
rich
beer
o
i
found
this
in
a
bottle
shop
marked
down
heavily
so
i
figured
what
the
hell
although
a
dubbel
is
usually
a
style
that
can
withstand
some
time
this
is
on
the
smaller
side
of
the
spectrum
at
7
abv
and
over
a
year
past
its
best
by
date
so
it
isnt
a
prime
candidate
for
cellaring
nor
did
the
brewers
intend
it
to
be
this
bottle
was
definitely
on
the
decline
but
its
still
hard
to
imagine
it
being
much
more
than
mediocre
even
within
prime
freshness
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
should
this
beer
ever
come
back
around
it
wasnt
intended
to
be
consumed
in
this
condition
so
it
may
be
worth
a
look
pours
a
slightly
murky
dark
orange
with
a
12
inch
fizzy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
balsalmic
vinegar
malt
and
some
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
pretty
sour
with
malt
dark
fruit
and
vinegar
flavors
all
mingled
together
there
is
an
acidic
quality
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
that
is
definitely
having
some
sort
of
issues
its
not
all
that
undrinkable
but
i
doubt
the
brewer
was
going
for
this
in
the
final
product
o
this
beer
dont
have
a
strong
malt
body
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
and
could
have
used
a
little
sweetness
o
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
think
you
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
but
i
might
not
personally
seems
like
the
malts
are
a
little
more
hidden
than
i
would
prefer
full
sail
products
are
known
for
their
ability
to
please
the
palate
and
to
offer
enough
taste
to
be
acceptable
to
most
anyone
without
going
to
extremes
full
sail
sanctuary
fits
this
description
quite
nicely
with
some
good
nice
pleasant
taste
characteristics
that
while
not
the
greatest
in
class
are
still
good
enough
to
make
the
beer
worthy
of
a
try
i
enjoyed
this
for
what
it
was
a
pretty
simple
basic
dubbel
nothing
really
worth
coming
back
to
but
it
was
very
drinkable
kens
bottle
overall
kinda
meh
quite
fruity
lots
of
esters
as
expected
somewhat
typical
belgian
yeast
components
but
a
bit
too
much
in
a
lot
of
aspects
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
worth
a
try
at
2
49
for
a
bomber
o
a
moderate
example
would
struggle
to
hold
its
own
against
finer
belgian
examples
st
bernardus
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
but
generally
not
bad
just
a
middle
of
the
road
example
too
clean
fermented
too
cool
boring
yeast
overattenuated
conclusion
i
think
the
only
reason
to
hate
on
this
beer
would
be
if
you
grabbed
it
out
of
the
fridge
and
knocked
it
back
without
letting
it
warm
true
to
the
delicate
belgian
style
this
needs
to
warm
up
to
about
50
or
else
everything
will
be
very
muted
and
flat
the
biggest
downer
for
this
beer
for
me
is
its
drinkability
basically
its
like
drinking
a
yeasty
winter
warmer
and
if
a
winter
warmer
is
too
sweet
and
rich
it
can
be
a
challenge
to
drink
22
ounceswhich
is
exactly
the
case
here
this
is
an
example
of
a
beer
that
belongs
in
a
6pack
not
a
22
it
tastes
great
but
a
22oz
just
gets
to
be
too
rich
for
one
person
towards
the
end
ok
you
can
do
better
a
rather
confusing
offering
from
full
sail
noting
really
seemed
to
gel
the
pieces
for
this
beer
are
there
just
not
the
unified
whole
one
would
hope
for
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
but
id
be
much
more
inclined
to
check
out
other
beers
if
given
a
choice
poured
amber
with
a
small
cap
of
white
head
bready
aroma
with
a
blend
of
sugars
and
malts
taste
of
caramel
malts
brown
sugar
bready
yeast
notes
of
fruit
esters
and
light
spice
gentle
hoppage
medium
body
slightly
chewy
an
average
moderately
drinkable
brew
overall
underwhelming
dubbel
neither
bad
nor
great
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentytwo
ounce
brown
glass
bomber
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
o
nice
beer
certainly
not
great
but
for
3
49
a
bomber
its
definitely
something
i
would
pick
up
again
i
have
been
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
specials
from
full
sail
for
the
most
part
and
this
is
no
exception
jd
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
dubbel
that
was
worth
buying
and
drinking
not
anything
special
but
worth
the
price
all
in
all
i
think
its
a
solid
above
average
dubbel
overall
while
not
inherently
bad
it
is
quite
lacking
all
around
never
hitting
all
the
right
dubbel
notes
full
sail
did
an
adequate
job
with
sanctuary
it
also
sells
at
full
sail
prices
at
3
99
for
the
bomber
a
relief
given
even
domestic
dubbels
are
selling
at
twice
that
price
this
might
be
a
good
one
to
break
a
newbie
into
the
world
of
dubbels
nice
belgian
yeast
cinnamon
and
dark
fruit
are
forefront
in
the
flavor
not
overly
complex
but
the
dubbel
flavor
is
surprisingly
well
done
here
there
have
been
a
few
full
sail
bombers
that
are
really
nice
especially
for
the
price
this
one
is
up
there
id
be
more
than
happy
to
buy
a
few
more
bottles
overall
this
is
an
average
interpretation
of
the
style
the
spice
character
is
a
bit
heavy
and
the
medicinal
qualities
really
hurt
the
flavor
kind
of
a
mess
that
needs
more
balance
poured
from
the
bottle
with
a
modest
egg
white
head
that
after
settling
still
managed
to
easily
cover
the
surface
of
the
beer
and
slid
off
the
glass
surface
with
no
hint
of
lacing
a
hazy
red
amber
beer
with
light
belgian
hop
and
straw
aroma
a
pleasing
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
carbination
up
front
a
malty
farmhouse
burst
followed
by
lemon
citrus
hop
finish
i
thought
it
was
good
for
its
style
although
the
7
for
a
belgian
dubbel
was
low
d
simple
and
quaffable
enough
slightly
aboveaverage
americanmade
dubbel
but
the
toffee
and
bitterness
quickly
clobber
the
other
flavors
going
on
the
alcohol
comes
through
with
a
few
sips
i
dont
get
this
why
a
reserve
is
this
really
a
dubbel
not
up
to
what
i
expect
from
full
sail
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
beer
does
a
fair
showing
for
a
dubbel
style
more
from
this
beer
is
needed
to
resurrect
it
from
doom
overall
nothing
extremely
special
slightly
sweet
full
bodied
drinker
its
smoothness
is
its
best
quality
flavors
are
nice
and
subtle
yet
not
enough
and
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
didnt
really
like
this
one
the
flavors
are
all
there
they
just
seem
a
bit
watered
down
the
mouth
feel
is
the
same
way
too
light
and
very
little
carbonation
this
is
disappointing
because
the
pour
looked
decent
not
recommended
only
5
dollars
for
the
bomber
it
was
still
drinkable
not
a
complete
loss
great
beer
rich
malty
aroma
has
notes
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
and
just
a
hint
of
apple
it
pours
a
clear
dark
coppery
brown
with
a
thick
and
rather
fluffy
cream
head
malty
flavor
has
notes
of
caramel
apple
and
pear
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
toffee
smooth
fullbodied
texture
has
a
fair
amount
of
fizz
and
leaves
a
very
satisfying
finish
o
good
tasting
and
easy
drinking
theres
better
belgian
stuff
on
the
shelves
for
a
comparable
price
but
still
a
nice
effort
sanctuary
isnt
a
world
class
dubbel
but
theres
no
major
missteps
this
brew
is
a
bit
light
all
the
way
around
the
lightness
adds
to
the
drinkability
with
out
detracting
too
much
from
the
complexity
props
to
full
sail
for
tackling
a
dubbel
properly
clear
dark
reddish
orange
with
thin
white
head
that
fades
instantly
with
nothing
left
on
the
glass
smell
lots
of
caramel
metallic
a
little
black
pepper
taste
caramel
mild
medicinal
hopping
a
little
alcohol
a
bit
fruity
but
mostly
just
sugar
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
not
enough
like
they
whiffed
on
their
target
gravity
meh
is
the
operative
reaction
here
2011
release
do
pretty
good
since
its
a
bit
lighter
than
the
average
dubbel
and
its
really
affordable
its
not
my
favorite
nor
is
it
my
least
favorite
of
the
style
but
the
price
is
right
on
this
one
so
im
glad
i
got
it
if
you
like
dubbels
youll
probably
feel
the
same
way
if
you
want
to
have
a
dubbel
on
a
budget
this
beer
is
a
great
pick
not
a
lot
of
complexity
or
strong
flavors
but
im
suprised
just
how
clean
and
drinkable
this
is
this
is
not
a
mindblowing
dubbel
but
its
solid
enjoyable
and
refreshing
o
generally
a
disappointment
makes
me
wondering
if
i
happened
across
a
bad
batch
or
an
old
bottle
but
i
can
only
review
from
my
experience
either
way
o
overall
i
must
admit
i
was
thoroughly
disappointed
in
this
one
i
think
it
even
turned
my
stomach
off
making
it
difficult
to
continue
our
beer
tasting
extravaganza
i
cant
fit
this
into
the
dubbel
category
so
i
have
to
give
it
a
lower
rating
for
that
however
its
not
at
all
bad
just
gets
into
insipid
territory
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
to
style
its
easy
drinking
with
a
good
taste
if
you
like
dubbels
this
is
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
consumed
928
overall
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
didnt
really
strike
me
a
standout
for
style
that
has
some
definite
heavy
hitters
the
tastes
were
a
little
to
inyourface
for
my
liking
i
tend
to
appreciate
more
complex
flavors
and
maltiness
in
dubbels
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
dont
know
if
id
look
for
it
specifically
drink
a
good
stepping
stone
into
the
style
for
the
price
worth
a
try
not
a
terribly
unpleasant
beer
but
outside
of
the
pleasant
aromas
nothing
really
going
for
it
either
not
a
beer
that
i
would
make
a
return
d
give
it
as
a
gift
dont
waste

im
a

this

not

dubbel
by
any
means
fiery
scarlet
red

thin
beige

adequate
amounts
of

as
i
drink
malty
aromas
of

and
nougat
accompany
some
sweet
candy
like
tones
on
the
nose
a
little
raisin
and
sherry
as
well
malty
and
somewhat
rich
on
the
buds
a
little
fig
and
raisin
thing
going
on
decent
enough
flavor
body
is
light
medium
and
the
alcohol
is
present
only
slightly
in
the
flavor
not
a
great
dubbel
compared
to
the
traditional
belgian
brands
but
a
nice
american
version
split
a
bomber
with
a
couple
friends
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
at
first
from
the
aroma
i
would
have
guessed
this
was
more
of
a
barleywine
from
the
fruity
malt
as
it
warmed
the
aroma
became
more
rummy
and
the
flavor
reminded
me
a
bit
of
dark
spiced
rum
from
the
additional
phenols
there
was
also
some
of
the
early
fruit
and
berries
character
it
was
a
smooth
mix
of
fruit
and
spice
but
my
one
complaint
is
that
the
forced
carbonation
throws
off
the
mouthfeel
d
very
enjoyable
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
but
flavorwise
it
is
a
bit
thin
not
as
malty
as
i
prefer
drinkability
is
good
heck
for
the
price
and
an
american
example
of
the
style
say
its
pretty
damn
good
might
not
be
world
class
but
worth
a
try
even
three
or
four
tries
perhaps
this
could
use
some
time
to
mellow
but
theres
not
to
much
redeemable
in
this
one
not
wholly
complex
or
enjoyable
this
just
seemed
like
a
simple
dubbel
with
a
fairly
hoppy
bitter
profile
the
bottle
says
its
lightly
hopped
perhaps
for
full
sail
it
is
but
it
really
stuck
with
you
over
the
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
akin
to
a
saison
or
a
sharply
carbonated
summer
beer
definitely
not
the
most
enjoyable
beer
for
this
style
but
not
bad
all
else
aside
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
almost
wish
they
had
not
dubbed
it
a
belgian
style
dubbel
and
just
let
it
stand
on
its
own
without
a
style
guideline
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
better
than
i
honestly
expected
from
this
brewery
certainly
worth
trying
when
you
see
it
flavor
sour
sweetness
from
a
heavy
malt
backbone
some
drinks
had
a
sharp
alcoholic
spike
at
the
finish
d
this
was
good
but
not
great
more
like
a
doppelbock
than
a
dubbel
to
me
it
had
a
decent
smell
and
taste
and
body
but
there
was
nothing
bold
or
complex
or
unique
about
it
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
passable
but
not
recommended
22oz
bottle

affordable
as
always
which

what
a

smells

knows
i
dont

the
taste
was
odd

i
feel
like
this
beer
will
be
overlypenalized
in
score
by
the
lowperforming
aroma
but
i
guess
thems
the
breaks
i
think
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
little
american
dubbel
id
have
this
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
had
no
belgian
varieties
around
there
is
no
way
that
sanctuary
is
even
in
the
same
league
as
a
belgian
dubbel
im
sorry
to
say
the
flavor
is
not
very
pushy
and
more
dry
than
sweet
the
fruits
are
mild
with
no
more
than
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
and
spicing
bittering
is
high
for
style
easily
forgivable
in
a
more
enticing
brew
overall
biscuity
and
not
very
complex
finishes
with
a
hint
of
cherry
but
not
enough
of
anything
malt
flavor
panache

try
this
recipe
again
d
pretty
good
beer
full

should
do
more
belgian

beers
both
ive
had
vesuvius
and

have

d
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of

something

i
wouldnt

to
drink
more
than
a
22
oz
bottle
of
this
at
a
time
primarily
because
it
is
such
a
sweet
beer
it
seems
like
i
would
get
too
used
to
it
and
not
enjoy
it
like
i
should
overall
an
okay
beer
maybe
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
better
had
it
been
labeled
a

because
thats

it

so
much
and
comparably
priced
this
brew
is
a
pretty
big
letdown
from
such
a
solid
consistent
brewery
other
comments
for
a
beer
calling
itself
a
dubbel
this
misses
the
mark
a
bit
i
expect
a
bolder
flavor
from
the
yeast
and
from
the
malt
profile
this
did
not
give
me
that
drinkability
is
pretty
dam
good
a
tasty
double
that
isnt
overblown
its
got
that
belgian
digestibility
that
makes
it
slide
down
too
quickly
a
little
better
then
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
very
impressive
offering
by
full
sail
body
is
smooth
but
not
quite
creamy
and
certainly
not
sticky
maybe
just
a
little
too
thin
for
a
dubbel
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
ale
with
definite
belgian
characteristics
but
its
still
a
bit
far
from
being
an
authentic
dubbel
d
no
to
bad
try
it
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
d
very
drinkable
everyone
this
is
a
great
brew
it
may
be
too
sweet
to
pour
into
6
packs
if
tweeked
maybe
but
i
like
it
as
it
is
and
id
be
happy
to
enjoy
a
few
22s
over
the
course
of
the
evening

near

thin

makes
this

overall
not
a
great

but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
poured
into
snifter

clear

amber
with
creamy

and
good

not
a

of

smell

of

almost
a

that

with

again
dark

with
a

it

to
it

the
look
is
somewhat
opaque
medium
brown
more
akin
to
a
belgian
dark
ale
vice
the
usual
dubbel
ale
the
smell
is
somewhat
mild
hardly
distinctive
in
any
way
the
taste
is
where
im
most
disappointed
seems
rather
plain
and
unremarkable
im
not
tasting
any
of
the
usual
distinctive
belgian
style
flavor
let
alone
any
of
the
fig
date
raisin
and
prune
the
label
claims
if
their
intent
was
to
make
a
mild
beer
then
they
were
successful
i
was
expecting
way
more
flavor
than
this
very
mild
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
no
complaints
there
but
again
nothing
special
either
overall
i
would
have
to
rate
this
a
big
disappointment
overall
will
have
to
say
that
this
beer
obviously
got
better
with
time
like
most
dubbels
nice
dark
fruit
flavor
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
flavor
too
booze
its
here
but
it
was
felt
and
not
tasted
thankfully
while
not
as
potent
or
as
deep
as
examples
from
europe
this
was
a
dubbel
that
was
true
to
form
and
bound
to
please
nearly
everyone
it
did
not
taste
like
the
other
beers
from
troegs
and
had
i
not
seem
the
label
on
the
bottle
i
wouldnt
have
been
sure
who
brewed
it
bright
for
this
style
this
was
chewy
and
full
enough
to
savor
and
something
that
id
want
to
picked
up
again
nice
job
by
troegs
on
this

quite

good

but
i
wouldnt

this
down
good

there
is

very
subdued
seems
like
raisin
there
is
also
a
wheat
yeasty
smell
with
what
i
would
call
toffee
o
this
is
a
decent
take
on
what
proves
to
be
a
very
challenging
style
for
american
brewers
to
nail
down
my
expectations
were
met
super
watery
not
much

very
carbonated
in
a

dont
rush
this
beer
and
your
patience

lacking
adjective
deficient
or
inadequate
everything
about
this
beer
is
off
in
my
opinion
i
like
the
taste
its
smooth
to
the
pallet
imo
overall
a
very
nice
dubbel
id
say
on
the
same
level
as
ommegang
or
at
least
very
close
overall
i
like
the
beer
a
lot
i
enjoy
the
american
style
belgian
flavors
keep
up
the
great
brewing
pours
a
nice
clear
brown
decent
creme
head
on
it
flavor
has
quite
a
belgian
thing
going
on
with
a
sugary
sweet
thing
with
mature
and
mild
fruits
smooth
and
consistent
flavor
well
done
carbonation
seems
a
bit
too
aggressive
as
its
really
nipping
at
my
mouth
kind
of
annoying
but
oh
well
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
have
no
clue
if
there
will
be
similar
beers
released
over
time
but
if
there
are
i
will
be
trying
them
flavor
is
semidry
with
some
malt
candi
sugar
sweetness
showing
up
midpalate
both
malty
and
fruity
hints
of
dark
fruit
underneath
a
toffee
malt
backbone
some
initial
harshness
in
the
carbonation
subsides
quickly
really
nice
dubbel
by
troegs
shockingly
bad
given
troegs
track
record
this
has
to
be
a
bad
batch
no
way
this
is
as
they
intended
it
to
be
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
lively
effervescent
carbonation
visually
this
brew
was
a
masterpiece
though
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
a
failure
this
brew
is
stylistically
flawed
and
they
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
for
releasing
this
to
the
public
there
is
no
desirable
belgian
flavor
to
this
which
makes
me
think
they
totally
bombed
it
on
the
fermenting
temps
taking
a
moment
to
read
the
labels
description
proves
that
this
beer
has
not
turned
out
the
way
they
intended
raisin
fig
date
prune
toffee
and
chocolate
nope
none
of
that
is
found
is
this
though
other
examples
of
the
dubbel
style
do
so
vibrantly
perhaps
i
got
a
bunk
bottlebatch
if
thats
the
case
i
would
not
mind
trying
this
again
though
im
not
wasting
more
money
to
potentially
buy
something
this
bad
amazing
beer
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
perfect
nothing
too
dynamic
or
experimental
going
on
so
it
may
lack
excitement
for
some
however
if
youre
a
fan
or
trappists
this
beer
is
will
not
disappoint
not
as
rich
as
westmalle
dubbel
but
has
it
has
the
same
velvety
luxurious
mouthfeel
of
an
orval
its
a
treat
to
drink
and
highly
impressive
that
troegs
was
able
to
produce
such
a
genuinely
tasting
belgian
brew
good
but
lacks
the
character
of
a
true
belgum
dubbel
like
corsendonk
or
chimay
maybe
it
will
get
better
with
age
the
best
knock
off
of
a
trappist
style
ale
i
have
ever
tried
the
look
smell
taste
mouthfeel
to
me
is
indistinguishable
from
chimay
premier
the
price
is
right
and
allows
me
to
enjoy
my
favorite
style
more
often
without
paying
astronomical
trappist
prices
i
will
be
buying
this
again
and
often
pretty
solid
head
nice
color
perfect
dubbel
taste
ive
had
plenty
of
dubbels
and
this
is
easily
in
my
top
3
i
love
it
no
complaints
at
all
perfect
5
for
me
the
taste
begins
with
mild
toasted
flavor
with
subtle
date
or
raisin
and
mild
woody
earthy
and
almost
prune
like
element
with
a
slight
pine
hop
accent
the
yeast
is
more
assertive
than
the
malt
with
mild
alcohol
coming
through
in
the
taste
and
nutty
flavor
as
it
warms
with
a
light
orange
zest
in
the
back
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
dubbel
with
a
bit
of
spice
from
the
yeast
an
dry
but
overall
a
nice
ale
with
belgian
yeast
character
and
moderate
alcohol
warming
amazing
time
to
drive
to
hershey
to
get
some
two
plus
fingers
worth
of
uneven
airy
crisp
slightly
offwhite
colored
audibly
fizzy
froth
with
a
bit
of
a
rocky
top
solid
to
excellent
retention
the
head
turns
much
creamier
and
smoother
as
this
one
starts
to
settle
a
little
more
than
a
moderate
bit
of
carbonation
most
of
which
is
tiny
in
size
and
rapid
in
pace
and
is
mostly
seen
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
the
color
is
a
murky
medium
brown
a
very
subtle
spiciness
to
start
next
is
a
slightly
more
dominate
array
of
dark
fruits
a
light
bit
of
belgian
yeast
well
rounded
good
depth
and
complexity
rock
solid
aroma
after
in
initial
kiss
of
sweetness
on
the
palate
an
array
of
new
flavors
present
themselves
a
pronounced
tobacco
presence
on
the
palate
also
a
touch
of
smokiness
and
char
the
finish
has
a
slightly
medicinal
cherry
quality
about
it
medium
bodied
sharp
carbonation
that
packs
a
good
bite
starts
lush
and
juicy
before
finishing
with
a
touch
of
dryness
overall
a
very
assertive
and
interesting
dubbel
lots
of
good
things
going
on
here
but
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
especially
in
terms
of
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
i
think
ill
let
the
rest
of
my
4pack
sit
for
a
bit
as
i
could
see
this
one
maturing
nicely

overall
i
had
my

about
this

but
it
turned
out
pretty
well
it
has
all
of
the
desired
flavors
and
it
remains
quite
drinkable
worth
a
shot
if
you
are
into

style

while
nothing
extraordinairy
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
from
troegs
and
one
i
was
happy
to
try
we
picked
this
up
at
the
brewery
and
brought
it
back
to
virginia
we
opened
it
on
a
beautiful
autum
day
and
really
enjoyed
the
cocoa
and
fruity
accents
i
have
one
more
bottle
i
will
taste
in
september
2015
very
nice
looking
burgundy
body
with
a
creamy
full
creamcolored
head
aromas
of
raisins
fruity
esters
toasted
malt
grains
very
belgianesqe
so
far
flavor
matches
the
aroma
to
an
extent
raisins
dried
fruits
grains
are
all
present
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
is
there
too
but
there
is
a
huge
medical
flavor
as
well
this
medicinal
taste
lingers
to
the
end
feel
is
good
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
overall
this
beer
would
be
very
nice
if
it
wasnt
for
the
medicinal
flavor
it
lingers
and
i
just
cant
get
over
it
this
one
definitely
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
more
than
lagrave
though
overall
good
dubbel
im
pretty
sure
id
have
again
though
a
bit
different
than
other
dubbels
i
get
it
for
the
most
part
initial
gush
of
foam
when
opening
bottle
pours
out
reddish
brown
with
very
small
oily
head
dried
fruits
runes
dominate
the
aroma
and
taste
overall
sweet
nature
on
this
more
fruit
and
some
yeast
on
the
finish
the
dark
flavors
of
medium
carmelazation
and
cold
coffee
are
what
i
expierenced
taste
burnt
caramel
and
coffee
the
alcohol
taste
is
very
pronounced
an
ok
dubbed
o
a
nicely
done
dubbel
the
slight
burnt
taste
is
taking
it
down
a
little
for
me
though
its
unique
unto
itself
and
certainly
not
the
worst
by
petrus
ive
tasted
drank
in
duncan
sc
july
2nd
2014
this
beer
was
not
all
that
bad
it
had
a
decent
taste
to
it
this
beer
was
not
too
heavy
or
too
light
it
went
down
smooth
the
taste
was
not
all
that
bad
it
was
not
too
strong
or
too
light
this
is
really
all
that
i
can
remember
about
this
beer
it
has
been
so
long
since
i
have
had
this
one
but
if
you
have
not
had
it
you
should
try
it
the
thing
that
i
remember
the
most
about
this
beer
is
that
i
liked
it
othis
is
a
pretty
simple
dubbel
and
not
one
that
i
would
go
searching
for
again
the
aroma
has
an
offputting
herbal
note
that
did
not
fit
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
while
this
low
point
is
not
as
prevalent
in
the
taste
the
beer
is
just
sort
of
uninspiring
nice
mouthfeel
for
what
that
is
worth
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
beer
glass
the
head
was
humongous
and
lasts
a
long
time
towards
the
end
of
the
pour
there
are
lots
of
dark
reddish
sediment
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
and
taste
it
very
heavy
carbonation
with
a
very
slight
sourness
that
ends
with
a
bitter
finish
nice
dark
reddish
caramel
color
not
a
smooth
beer
to
drink
has
a
very
woody
smell
and
taste
to
it
good
substance
overall
not
a
bad
beer
overall
well
balanced
and
complex
flavor
stays
around
a
bit
more
than
others
in
the
petrus
sample
pack
o
this
is
actually
a
really
great
dubbel
very
surprised
by
the
overall
review
of
this
one
but
i
guess
i
am
a
bit
different
on
my
opinion
of
it
not
too
many
dubbels
showcase
that
complex
of
a
fruit
flavor
profile
in
recent
memory
o
nothing
special
here
too
bad
it
deserved
to
be
more
complex
overall
at
5
dollars
a
bottle
its
not
an
everyday
kind
of
beer
but
an
exceptional
dubbel
pick
it
up
o
ok
but
compared
poorly
to
the
valdieu
dubbel
that
preceded
it
aside
from
a
few
complaints
its
an
otherwise
enjoyable
easytodrink
dubbel
and
another
wellcrafted
brew
from
petrus
this
is
really
an
impressive
beer
it
has
a
tremendously
malty
flavor
profile
it
has
an
intricate
range
of
flavors
that
keeps
me
interested
in
each
sip
there
really
isnt
anything
bad
to
say
about
this
one
it
was
definitely
a
good
find

that

this

my

he
was

to
me
this
was
pure
heaven
this
can
be

i
could
had
no

had
served
it

a

the

it

to
cover
all

standard
characteristics
there
is
dark

and
a
touch
of
spicy
character
but
the
sugary
notes
dominate
the
sweetness
leaves
it
feeling
a

flabby
but
it
isnt

bit
good
flavor
balance
and
complexity
not
as
complex
as
others
in
the
style
but
it
will
do
no
cloying
flavors
at
all
slightly
dry
on
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
barely
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
dubbel
not
as
complex
as
some
but
is
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
enjoyable
2nd
of
the
sampler
pack
i
think
its
just
old
stuff
from
total
wine
poured
it
into
the
petrus
sampler
pack
glass
and
saw
a
14
thick
black
sediment
stuck
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
took
several
rinsings
of
water
to
get
it
out
i
dont
know
if
this
stuff
is
old
sat
in
the
sun
very
low
quality
or
just
sets
out
to
be
a
strange
brew
pours
really
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
very
little
foam
atop
light
cola
malt
smell
some
candi
sugar
taste
is
a
full
flavorful
malt
loads
of
cola
taste
too
backed
by
a
mild
hop
dark
cherries
too
as
the
beer
warms
more
dark
fruit
surfaces
low
carbonation
quite
good
a
nice
bold
maltforward
beer
leaning
towards
the
sweet
side
of
things
perhaps
a
tad
too
sweet
but
still
tasty
o
its
really
not
bad
its
just
not
great
and
in
a
category
with
tons
of
amazing
competitors
the
finish
just
hangs
on
for
too
long
if
the
carbonation
could
be
a
little
more
lively
and
that
tanginess
could
hang
on
a
little
longer
this
would
really
be
a
pleasure
to
drink
an
interesting
dubbel
im
worried
i
got
an
off
bottle
because
no
one
else
mentions
it
has
a
tartness
in
their
review
but
it
actually
adds
a
nice
element
that
probably
made
the
beer
for
me
otherwise
the
dark
fruits
werent
nearly
forward
enough
and
there
wasnt
enough
carbonation
dark
in
color
with
strong
fingers
and
good
head
malty
smell
with
a
strong
raisin
and
hints
of
floral
very
pleasant
to
take
in
delicious
beer
all
throughout
caramel
raisin
malty
just
a
good
beer
to
drink
a
little
flat
for
a
dubbel
imo
but
still
good
thick
and
has
decent
carbonation
throughout
this
is
just
a
good
belgian
beer
and
not
recently
readily
available
in
the
us
take
advantage
as
long
as
the
price
range
stays
competitive
o
not
that
great
the
taste
profile
is
similar
to
a
beer
cola
as
for
characteristics
of
a
dubbel
this
brew
contains
many
of
them
from
the
hops
to
the
carbonation
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
strangely
but
its
not
like
most
dubbels
ive
had
still
unless
the
words
after
petrus
are
oud
bruin
i
am
probably
passing
on
anything
else
they
make
if
you
like
typical
belgian
dark
ale
sweet
dubbel
thatd
be
quite
good
choice
for
you
cheers
very
underwhelming
dubbel
this
mixed
gift
pack
is
all
over
the
map
some
good
some
not
this
started
out
really
well
and
had
the
signs
this
was
going
to
be
a
phenomenal
beer
its
still
a
very
good
one
but
it
ends
up
feeling
a
little
disappointing
just
because
it
promised
so
much
m
start
with
some
sweetness
but
changes
to
a
bitter
and
ending
that
remains
on
the
tongue
and
not
in
the
back
it
is
more
chewy
than
dry
petrus
dubbel
bruin
ale
pours
a
deep
murky
mahogany
with
some
red
highlights
shining
through
theres
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
khaki
colored
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
barely
there
this
is
one
of
the
less
impressive
belgians
ive
seen
the
nose
has
a
little
bit
of
clove
and
even
less
fruit
its
dominated
by
a
rummy
dark
sugar
sweetness
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
same
but
that
sweetness
is
even
a
bit
more
overbearing
theres
also
a
bit
of
out
of
place
bitterness
present
and
to
be
honest
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
cola
than
a
beer
the
body
is
just
a
touch
too
full
and
the
carbonation
a
little
bit
dull
but
theyre
both
pretty
close
i
may
have
to
go
pick
up
some
ommegang
abbey
ale
or
chimay
rouge
soon
because
between
this
and
a
soon
to
be
reviewed
st
vincents
dubbel
ive
had
a
mini
run
of
the
worst
dubbels
ive
ever
had
o
this
is
an
underrated
acessible
dubbel
probably
the
easiest
drinking

ive
had
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
too
sweet
too
thin
too
sticky
overall
it
is
a
bit
candylike
for
the
style
but
i
find
myself
rather
enjoying
this
beer
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
them
but
one
is
pretty
refreshing
and
tasty
overall
while
this
ale
pours
a
fairly
dark
brown
the
light
sugary
almost
airy
flavors
prove
an
unexpected
surprise
i
can
see
how
some
would
be
turned
off
by
this
expecting
more
robust
earthy
notes
but
the
flavors
work
well
for

i
have
two
bottles
but
for
me
it
was
a
little
offputting
i
didnt
even
feel
like
finishing
this
one
d
this
is
a
nice
dubbel
a
little
more
fruit
flavor
than
most
dubbels
d
a
very
easy
drinker
yet
very
flavorful
goes
down
almost
too
easily
aftertaste
in
the
end
is
a
little
much
but
does
not
detract
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
given
the
opportunity
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
smells
like
vinegar
taste
is
very
tart
vinegar
and
sourness
up
front
the
middle
tastes
like
your
average
dubbel
finish
is
sour
mouthfeel
is
better
somewhat
full
average
carbonation
levels
drinkability
isnt
very
high
both
of
the
beers
i
have
been
able
to
finish
at
different
settings
but
i
dont
find
them
to
be
particularly
pleasant
for
the
price
a
terrible
value
i
would
not
buy
this
again
there
are
much
better
dubbels
out
there
d
the
flavors
are
nice
but
its
so
sweet
that
it
seems
like
a
desert
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
average
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
fruit
and
clove
some
plum
smells
a
little
malt
the
taste
is
typical
belgium
its
fruit
forward
its
plum
and
apple
and
melon
its
different
for
me
but
enjoyable
to
try
the
moutfeel
is
full
and
fruity
and
is
easy
to
drink
its
different
for
me
and
ill
recommend
trying
it
but
i
wont
buy
this
one
very
often
but
was
glad
to
try
something
different
interesting
reddish
brown
color
with
thin
tan
head
smell
is
kind
of
like
grape
taste
is
almost
like
grape
soda
and
spices
and
maybe
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
it
has
a
crisp
light
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
and
its
not
to
heavy
alcoholwise
making
it
even
more
drinkable
had
it
with
some
lasagna
poured
a
brown
body
covered
by
a
slowly
dieing
twofinger
tan
head
that
died
quickly
malts
are
prevelant
in
the
smell
along
with
hints
of
that
belgian
yeast
strain
and
some
heavier
fruits
like
orange
nothing
grabs
you
but
this
beer
is
pleasant
to
drink
w
a
smooth
creamy
mediumbodied
texture
that
passes
easily
and
finishes
clean
despite
a
little
stickiness
good
balance
but
leans
more
to
malts
as
chocolate
caramel
hints
of
vanilla
roasted
and
something
akin
to
syrupmolasses
hold
a
slight
edge
over
some
floral
hops
and
flavors
like
orange
and
fig
this
is
a
beer
you
can
relax
with
at
dinner
d
with
so
many
other
more
enjoyable
beers
in
the
dubbel
style
this
is
just
not
in
the
cards
too
sour
for
its
own
good
i
tried
to
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
but
this
just
isnt
working
d
could
easily
have
had
more
if
it
werent
so
expensive
for
a
relatively
small
amount
since
it
was
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
for
68
months
poured
a
dark
mahogany
brown
color
reddishorange
hilights
when
held
to
the
light
big
bubbly
head
that
rose
up
quickly
then
gone
just
as
fast
aroma
has
lots
of
fruit
raisin
currants
plum
also
some
caramel
sweetness
followed
up
with
some
alcohol
taste
is
rich
and
complex
sugary
sweet
dark
fruits
with
a
tart
end
warming
alcohol
with
an
oak
barrel
like
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
maybe
lighter
expected
from
the
smell
low
or
no
carbonation
make
it
smooth
and
creamy
very
enjoyable
but
alcohol
starts
to
burn
is
it
warms
too
much
pours
a
very
hazy
color
between
amber
and
brown
with
a
kind
of
thin
offwhite
head
the
head
dissapates
quickly
and
leaves
just
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
almost
entirely
like
cola
with
a
bit
of
whiskey
mixed
in
maybe
the
taste
is
nice
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
there
isnt
an
amazing
amount
of
depth
which
hurt
the
score
because
its
not
outstanding
but
i
just
wished
that
i
had
this
at
hand
forever
it
just
has
the
right
amount
of
sugary
sweetness
like
candy
that
doesnt
make
me
sick
when
i
overindulge
and
there
is
not
a
single
offflavor
very
very
pleasant
and
i
only
regret
that
i
didnt
have
more
to
drink
if
this
sold
at
american
craft
prices
it
could
be
a
standby
beer
when
i
just
wanted
something
malty
and
sweet
really
worth
giving
a
shot
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
finish
on
this
brew
is
dry
like
certain
red
wines
not
merlot
or
cab
sav
dry
but
still
dry
as
previously
mentioned
it
has
a
very
vinous
character
feel
is
mediumlight
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
very
low
which
seems
to
work
very
nicely
for
this
beer
aftertaste
is
long
lasting
which
is
nice
this
is
one
that
drinks
easy
but
as
to
buying
it
again
it
really
doesnt
drive
me
to
do
so
it
is
an
average
beer
nothing
special
nothing
damning
sure
ill
drink
the
rest
of
this
beer
but
its
not
as
if
i
really
look
forward
to
drinking
the
rest
of
it
ill
drink
the
rest
of
it
because
it
is
here
and
because
im
still
trying
to
put
a
finger
on
what
it
is
about
it
that
intrigues
me
drinkability0
aside
from
the
taste
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
and
i
havent
really
had
enough
of
the
double
brown
style
to
really
know
how
to
classify
much
sweeter
than
others
with
more
upfront
fruit
notes
delicious
nonetheless
i
could
definitely
have
another
right
now
and
will
keep
my
eyes
open
in
the
future
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
well
made
example
of
dubbel
drinkable
drinkability
was
good
light
body
and
fairly
neutral
taste
notes
this
is
the
reason
that
i
enjoy
belgians
ultimately
interesting
beers
that
challenge
the
palate
and
provide
tastes
of
a
wide
range
they
also
tend
to
be
plenty
malty
which
is
much
to
my
liking
as
well
good
beer
poured
wth
a
nice
big
tan
head
no
lace
head
mostly
subsides
color
is
a
dark
brownish
amber
aroma
is
yeasty
malty
a
hint
fruity
and
sour
flavor
is
about
the
same
but
also
a
hint
of
caramel
interesting
relationship
between
flavors
body

thin

not

decent

satisfying
session
beer
clean
i
really
liked
the
aroma
very
inviting
i
wouldnt
call
the
flavour
sickly
sweet
but
it
needs
a
little
more
alcoholdryness
to
perk
things
up
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
certainly
worth
trying
to
see
a
different
take
on
the
style
just
dont
choose
it
as
your
first
sample
of
dubbel
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
could
probably
get
used
to
this
one
a
little
sweet
but
nice
overall
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
refreshing
and
comforting
pours
a
dark

color
with
a
thin

is
very
strong

of
tart

a

ps
1st
effort
at
review
forgive
me
if
it
stinks
not
too
bad
i
wouldnt
pass
up
a
bottle
glass
if
i
was
offered
one
again
first
beer
tasted
from
petrus
and
it
was
quite
unique
more
sweet
and
funky
than
i
thought
it
would
be
lack
of
carbonation
also
threw
me
off
a
bit
but
it
was
an
interesting
brew
that
kept
me
guessing
might
drink
again
if
i
ever
see
it
worth
trying
d
i
did
not
find
this
to
be
a
good
beer
i
am
not
sure
if
that
is
because
i
dont
like
the
style
or
if
this
is
just
not
that
great
the
alcohol
is
not
too
strong
but
the
beer
it
too
sugary
to
be
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
again
didnt
blow
me
away
in
the
good
sense
or
bad
this
is
an
average
good
beer
meaning
id
have
it
again
but
i
just
wont
rave
about
it
others
who
commented
about
the
head
thinning
fast
are
bang
on
i
drank
it
from
a
goblet
the
westmalle
one
if
that
detail
matters
seems
to
smooth
as
temperature
warms
though
but
still
feels
thin
not
a
bad
mouthfeel
but
nothing
great
it
has
a
smooth
carbonation
but
the
beers
finish
is
fake
its
too
sweet
and
tastes
more
like
a
poor
extract
homebrew
attempt
i
have
to
take
away
points
on
the
drinkability
this
is
like
cough
syrup
in
a
bottle
with
a
cool
beer
label
i
would
avoid
this
one
an
impressive
dubbel
from
petrus
i
would
happily
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
were
it
more
available
smooth

fullbodied
highly
recommend
this
beer
poured
into
a
chimay
glass
petrus
dubbel
is
fairly
dark
reddishtinted
brown
beer
the
foam
on
top
fades
pretty
quickly
though
leaving
a
smooth
surface
nose
is
light
though
pleasantly
fruity
with
a
tangy
edge
light
caramel
taste
yeasty
fruitiness
acidic
finish
its
not
well
balanced
though
i
think
itd
probably
make
a
good
accompaniment
for
food
but
its
just
not
a
very
complex
or
interesting
beer
for
drinking
not
the
most
appealing
dubbel
ive
ever
tried
it
kind
of
only
meets
you
halfway
and
then
either
gives
up
or
peters
out
smooth
bodied
with
a
little
less
than
average
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
lends
itself
to
hearty
sips
this
isnt
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
it
was
pleasant
tonight
d
a
touch
sweet
even
for
a
dubbel
but
satisfying
none
the
less
d
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
by
any
means
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
just
really
dont
want
to
lol
not
real
drinkable
in
my
opinion
if
you
want
a
dubbel
there
are
about
1000
better
ones
out
there
not
bad
for
a
dubbel
but
other
examples
are
far
superior
and
much
more
worth
seeking
nice
full
bodied
mouthfeel
and
generous
carboation
fairly
drinkable
but
kind
of
a
sipper
even
though
its
only
6
5
definitely
pretty
enjoyable
but
i
probably
wont
buy
another
one
for
awhile
too
many
good
beers
to
drink
worth
it
though
get
one
and
taste
it

a

appearance
with
a
dark
brown
purple
hue
with
an
attractive
foamy
and
frothy
head
that
lingered
for
a
bit
smell
was
very
rich
with
obvious
figs
and
prunes
pouring
through
taste
was
overly
sweet
and
thick
flavor
loaded
with
sugars
dehydrated
fruits
caramel
and
strong
sugars
very
very
sweet
taste
with
a
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkability
took
a
hit
due
to
the
ultrarich
and
ultrathick
slightly
cloying
taste
that
stuck
to
the
tongue
like
other
petrus
brews
ive
sampled
this
one
was
good
but
not
great
not
my
favorite
depiction
of
the
syle
but
not
a
total
waste
either
certainly
a
very
sweet
thick
and
fullbodied
brew
if
you
like
ultracreamy
and
rich
beers
this
one
is
for
you
alcohol
is
wellcovered
it
is
tasty
and
smooth
a
nice
malty
brew
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
cherries
plums
and
a
hint
of
anise
the
taste
is
of
tart
cherries
with
a
hint
of
caramel
i
even
think
i
detect
some
bretta
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
however
there
are
so
many
belgian
beers
out
there
which
a
lot
more
complex
that
i
cant
see
myseld
drinking
this
again
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
deep
amber
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
fruity
maltiness
in
the
taste
a
sweet
malt
and
quite
fruity
like
apples
and
white
grapes
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
bite
and
a
semidry
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
nice
decent
however
nothing
really
that
great
about
it
dark
brown
with
amber
edges
a
single
finger
of
light
tan
head
tops
this
beer
and
quickly
fades
to
a
fine
layer
smells
rich
and
malty
toffey
and
dark
fruit
silky
in
the
mouth
with
more
dark
fruit
malty
sweetness
and
a
boozey
finish
aftertaste
could
linger
longer
my
favorite
of
the
petrus
line
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
doesn¬ít
stay
around
long
molasses
nose
flavor
has
a
strong
hint
of
molasses
and
a
slight
bit
of
caramel
as
well
with
a
steady
and
even
flavor
slight
touch
of
malt
feel
is
slightly
higher
than
average
on
the
carbonation
and
it
feels
very
good
with
the
combo
of
flavoring
against
it
very
drinkable
another
from
this
6pack
i
could
down
many
of
in
a
sitting
tastemouthfeel
very
soft
and
sweet
flavors
notes
of
caramelized
fruit
nuts
and
brown
sugar
this
is
sweeter
than
most
dubbels
but
its
quite
good
finishes
clean
with
virtually
no
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
d
i
like
this
ale
and
will
drink
it
again
and
would
suggest
to
anyone
i
do
worry
that
if
i
had
more
than
two
at
a
sitting
this
could
end
up
really
hurting
me
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
orange
head
aroma
was
a
little
disappointing
just
mildly
malty
taste
was
fairly
sweet
compared
to
some
of
the
past
dubbels
ive
tried
but
quite
pleasant
with
a
taste
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
acidity
fairly
clean
drinking
didnt
blow
my
mind
but
quite
a
tasty
brew
overall
another
pedestrian
brew
from
petrus
this
one
comes
across
as
a
bit
overly
sweet
but
otherwise
not
bad
worth
a
try
if
not
for
the
excessive
price

delaneys
always
serves
their
belgians
in
proper
glassware
and
this
time
was
no
exception
this
lovely
dubbel
was
served
in
a
tall
long
stemmed
petrus
glass
its
deep
brown
color
modest
head
and
specks
of
yeast
made
for
an
interesting
introduction
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
candied
sugar
with
molasses
and
a
hint
of
malt
aged
prunes
and
like
fruit
was
also
clearly
evident
the
taste
was
bursting
with
sweet
raisens
and
candied
sugar
balanced
just
perfectly
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
sweet
just
a
solid
dubbel
and
one
i
will
be
sure
to
revisit
either
in
bottle
or
tap
thisis
one
smooth
belgian
and
very
worth
savoring
d
this
beer
is
subtle
but
still
complex
this
is
a
good
session
beer
if
you
like
wild
ales
but
cant
drink
a
monster
tart
beer
i
could
have
several
of
these
and
the
subtle
notes
make
we
want
to
taste
more
of
them
pretty
good
stuff
maybe
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
a
glass
d
this
would
make
a
very
good
afterdinner
drink
but
for
the
most
part
i
dont
know
if
id
come
back
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
palate
i
don¬ít
have
any
personal
vendetta
against
petrus
i¬íve
just
had
some
of
the
worst
beers
i¬íve
ever
tried
and
i¬íve
been
drinking
¬ìgood¬î
beer
for
15
years
taste
is
caramellic
molasses
and
candi
sugar
with
some
sour
notes
the
yeast
appears
to
be
quite
funky
and
not
very
fresh
i
found
this
taste
in
some
lambics
and
i
did
not
like
it
there
either
it
certainly
does
not
fit
in
a
dubbel
imo
aftertaste
is
sweet
but
the
beer
wasnt
sweet
but
dry
had
in
pittsburgh
after
trying
the
petrus
blonde
the
beer
poured
with
a
huge
head
similar
to
the
blonde
but
obviously
a
dark
brown
color
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
a
little
rasinyfiggy
and
the
flavor
was
sweet
and
dark
fruity
but
could
have
been
a
little
richer
it
was
pretty
good
nonetheless
but
not
in
the
top

mouthfeel

mildly
sweet
and

other
than
aged
pale
ale
which
i
think
is
their
finest
creation
ive
never
really
been
wowed
by
beer
from
this
brewery
dubbel
bruin
is
decent
and
is
easy
to
drink
but
compared
to
the
worlds
finest
versions
its
amateurish
at
best
oelergud
this
was
much
better
than
the
allagash
dubbel
i
recently
had
maybe
a
little
sweet
for
some
tastes
a
fair
dubbel
that
gave
me
no
real
problems
with
drinking
the
bottle
i
enjoyed
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
for
my
500th
review
has
it
been
that
many
already
wow
this
is
a
great
dubbel
but
rather
different
than
trappist
dubbels
i
have
had
i
am
not
sure
if
the
wortiness
is
true
to
style
but
it
was
very
unusual
and
strangely
delicious
i
think
this
is
a
must
try
even
though
it
is
not
a
trappist
or
abby
dubbel
notes
the
metallic
smell
was
hard
to
get
over
but
where
the
rubber
hits
the
road
this
brew
holds
up
well
the
petrus
line
from
bavik
has
been
hit
or
miss
to
me
and
this
one
is
somewhere
in
the
middle
such
a
magnificent
style
that
if
i
had
never
had
a
dubbel
before
id
be
impressed
since
that
is
not
the
case
this
one
stacks
up
to
be
about
average
server
on
draft
in
petrus
chalice
the
dubbel
was
dark
brown
with
a
very
small
white
head
which
quickly
dissipated
and
left
no
lace
the
was
no
noticeable
aroma
the
taste
is
rather
pleasant
however
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
it
was
sweet
malty
and
vinous
with
notes
of
toffee
and
brown
sugar
and
a
slight
bite
not
from
the
alcohol
i
think
but
the
minerals
the
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
a
bit
syrupy
from
all
the
malt
but
the
complexity
from
the
water
and
yeast
made
it
relatively
drinkable
drinkability
decent
but
cetainly
not
stellar
would
benefit
from
a
more
balanced
profile
this
dubbel
pours
a
medium
brown
that
looks
teasingly
translucent
smallish
head
that
fades
to
a
grey
dusting
nose
is
quite
nice
juicy
fruity
and
sweet
candi
sugar
in
the
nose
along
with
some
raisins
and
granny
smith
apples
initially
acidic
on
the
tongue
with
fruit
esters
of
apples
coming
out
turns
sweet
at
the
midpalate
with
slightly
caramelized
candi
sugar
the
focus
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
quite
varied
acidic
at
first
slick
next
but
never
too
heavy
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
drinkable
belgian
dubbel
not
as
heavy
as
many
of
the
abbey
versions
but
flavorful
and
interesting
nonetheless
dont
quite
like
this
one
from
petrus
but
i
will
try
again
smooth
mouthfeel
coupled
with
an
intensely
sweet
ripe
plum
flavor
characteristic
as
it
warms
a
rootginger
beer
flavor
emerges
not
overly
complex
as
one
would
expect
from
a
belgian
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
what
a
disgusting
beer
this
is
its
nowhere
close
to
being
a
dubbel
way
too
sweet
and
obviously
flavored
with
saccharin
yeast
choice
is
all
wrong
a
mistake
stay
away
blech
down
the
drain
this
goes
drinkability
notes
¬ñ
not
digestible
as
the
belgians
would
say
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
a
nice
summer
dubbel
relatively
light
in
alcohol
with
a
smooth
flavor
that
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
archetypes
of
the
style
d
good
easily
drink
one
or
two
a
session
more
would
be
pushing
it
fire
up
the
bbq
and
lets
braise
some
ribs
a
good
brew
that
would
be
nice
as
an
after
dinner
sipper
might
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
some
folks
drinkability
and
overall
half
of
this
beer
is
delicious
half
is
terrible
overall
the
terrible
half
prevails
turning
this
into
a
cloying
overly
sweet
unbalanced
brew
pass
pours
out
nicely
with
a
big
head
that
falls
into
a
good
strong
lacing
smells
different
and
therefore
very
good
from
what
ive
reviewed
lately
i
always
enjoy
a
new
taste
its
full
flavored
and
a
little
spicy
with
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
sour
in
a
good
way
i
would
definetly
have
more
of
these
nothing
outstanding
here
but
this
was
a
very
solid
brew
funny
how
i
have
picked
up
a
lot
of
petrus
bottles
to
date
yet
i
never
seem
to
see
this
one
draft
version
was
good
and
well
worth
trying
if
a
little
too
sweet
at
times
this
beer
came
a
very
dark
amber
with
slight
brown
and
burgundy
highlights
the
head
was
huge
uneven
and
a
dark
tan
smelled
of
sugary
sweet
malts
and
a
sweet
and
mildly
tart
over
ripe
fruit
tasted
clean
and
light
with
a
light
malt
and
candy
sweetness
that
collapses
into
a
powdery
dry
cherry
the
cherry
and
a
dry
chocolate
nip
at
the
edges
of
my
tongue
in
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
syrupy
feel
to
it
along
with
a
light
tingly
carbonation
i
gave
this
a
high
drinkability
because
despite
its
almost
overpowering
sweet
syrupy
character
this
comes
off
almost
a
desert
drink
and
i
found
myself
having
no
problem
in
drinking
it
the
beer
disembarks
the
330ml
brown
bottle
a
clear
deep
brown
with
a
perpetual
frothy
tan
head
that
lingers
on
but
after
its
depletion
to
nothingness
the
residual
lace
forms
a
tight
skirt
upon
the
glass
nose
is
musky
hints
of
caramel
with
a
nice
malt
sweetness
a
fine
sniffer
to
be
sure
start
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
pleasing
grain
presence
top
is
fair
to
middling
in
its
feel
finish
is
benignly
acidic
the
hops
present
and
pleasing
the
aftertaste
dry
and
a
fine
beer
to
end
the
evening
with
a
dark
brown
color
with
loads
of
foam
that
just
sits
there
indefinitely
when
the
head
begins
to
deflate
it
leaves
behind
excellent
lacing
aromas
of
caramelized
sugar
malt
and
candy
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
engaging
with
a
fruit
flavor
that
works
into
both
the
sweetness
and
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
a
very
delicate
beer
in
that
all
of
the
textures
and
flavors
collaborate
with
one
another
impressive
beer
for
its
lack
of
overpowering
dominating
characteristics
very
drinkable
especially
with
a
lower
abv
for
this
style

as
the
8

within
this
one
which
is
close

unnoticeable

and
straightforward
plenty
of
sweet
roasty

frothy

makes
for
an

the

at

i
was
concerned
for

what
the

surprisingly
it
had
lots

had

it

level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
fairly
tasty
but
the
smoke
presence
i
am
getting
is
unexpected
for
the
style
o
a
very
satisfying
and
drinkable
brune
the
8
abv
is
mostly
well
hidden
this
is
a
good
beer
but
with
decent
flavor
but
what
throws
me
off
is
the
sourness
like
one
might
taste
in
a
flanders
style
in
any
event
a
pretty
likeable

good

substantial
instead
of

you
know
its
there
but
it
isnt
a
burden
i
picked
up
some
nuttyness
brown
suger
and
some
alchol
i
got
this
one
on
a
whim
with
no
expectations
ill
get
it
with
malice

fore
thought

this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
slick
modest
amount
of
carbonation
that
was
perfect
for
the
style
overall
it
was
a
decent
take
on
the
style
with
the
aroma
being
a
bit
underwhelming
but
the
flavor
really
picking
things
up
my
only
gripe
is
that
the
flavor
and
residual
malt
character
almost
had
a
bit
of
piercing
sweetness
that
stung
the
back
of
the
throat
having
dried
this
out
just
a
little
bit
would
have
helped
to
increase
the
overall
enjoyable
and
drinkability
asis
i
almost
feel
guilty
like
i
should
go
take
a
shot
of
insulin
to
counteract
the
sweetness
of
this

this

this
brew
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
off

head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
there
is
a
decent
amount
of

left
on

on
the
nose
i
get
some

and
coffee
on
the
next
sniff
i
get
some
chocolate
on
it
and
a
hint
of
smoke
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
noses
that
ive
had
on
a
beer
on
first
sip
theres
a
decent
amount
of
sweetness
to
this
brew
with
a
very
subtle
hint
of
bitterness
i
get
dates
some
coffee
notes
and
chocolate
i
also
get
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
the
alcohol
despite
being
pretty
high
for
8
is
completely
hidden
there
is
also
moderate
carbonation
on
this
brew
i
also
thought
that
this
was
going
to
a
heavy
beer
due
to
the
color
but
this
is
a
lot
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
finish
on
the
brew
is
mildly
bitter
and
lingers
this
is
an
awesome
beer
that
is
full
of
complexities
and
nuances
i
will
definitely
be
trying
more
belgians
if
theyre
at
all
like
this
o
this
is
a
fair
brown
that
was
below
what
i
anticipated
it
may
just
be
the
bottle
i
received
but
this
is
far
from
the
better
dubbels
i
have
come
across
overall
i
was
positively
surprised
this
is
a
beer
to
take
your
time
with
and
it
doesnt
give
you
much
of
a
choice
in
the
matter
either
it
was
surprisingly
stoutlike
at
times
yet
always
smooth
and
subtle
valdieu
just
doesnt
resound
as
well
as
mon
dieu
does
it
oh
well
this
stuff
pours
a
somewhat
dingy
brown
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
and
populated
by
some
minor
floaties
the
nose
comprises
caramel
toffee
light
cardboard
light
walnut
and
light
white
bread
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
light
dark
fruits
light
cardboard
and
a
touch
of
rye
bread
methinks
oxidation
has
gotten
to
this
but
its
not
in
the
usual
way
so
thats
questionable
at
this
point
still
it
aint
half
bad
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
dubbel
but
nothing
close
to
exceptional
or
special
this
is
an
abbey
beer
brewed
with
great
craftsmanship
its
balanced
and
has
an
unexpected
taste
o
i
have
a
particular
love
for
this
brewery
though
i
still
prefer
the
blonde
to
the
brune
a
solid
dubbel
though
not
as
a
rich
in
malt
character
as
some
others
and
the
mouthfeel
could
use
some
cleaning
up
still
the
flavors
blend
nicely
and
the
yeast
character
is
particularly
interesting
o
very
nice
belgian
dubbel
had
no
expectations
going
into
this
one
happy
with
what
i
found
not
my
favorite
style
prefer
the
hoppier
stuff
but
this
works
quite
nicely
a
semislow
drinker
should
get
me
through
most
of
the
rest
of
the
night
good
lacing
and
fingers
around
glass
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
low
head
head
is
a
oatmeal
cream
color
rustic
oak
smell
strong
with
subtle
esters
of
alcohol
and
belgian
hops
subtle
taste
not
too
strong
in
any
one
area
a
slight
sourness
but
very
very
subtle
my
palette
cant
really
put
a
finger
on
the
taste
of
this
but
i
like
it
there
are
a
lot
of
complexities
going
on
with
this
beer
but
somehow
it
remains
subtle
carbonation
is
nice
right
in
between
a
very
good
beer
too
bad
i
bought
it
in
a
box
set
and
have
not
seen
this
anywhere
else
the
tripel
seems
to
have
even
better
reviews
cant
wait
to
try
that
poured
a
medium
brown
with
a
large
rocky
off
white
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
toasted
malts
a
leathery
yeast
and
a
slight
herbal
hop
with
notes
of
molasses
and
coffee
it
tasted
lighty
sweet
and
sour
at
first
and
ended
slightly
bitter
with
a
strong
hint
of
coffee
and
a
slight
alcohol
finish
that
lasted
a
short
time
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
oily
in
texture
with
a
flat
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
abbey
ale
d
goes
down
super
smooth
and
a
great
balance
of
flavor
perfect
for
a
chilly
night
overall
a
very
good
dubbel
although
still
not
one
of
the
best
a
good
value
and
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
the
style
pours
a
very
dark
cloudy
colour
with
lots
of
bubbles
strongly
carbonated
and
a
very
nice
creamy
tan
head
with
amazing
lacing
initial
smell
is
quite
weak
not
very
strong
dark
roasts
and
alcohol
with
toffee
taste
is
quite
the
same
with
a
hint
of
added
yeast
very
refreshing
this
is
the
second
bier
i
have
had
by
val
dieu
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
these
beers
are
two
of
the
finest
beers
i
have
ever
tried
d
must
slow
down
this
is
8
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
its
drinkable
meant
for
wet
cold
fall
evenings
nice
example
of
the
style
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
fruit
ester
and
candi
sugar
is
quite
enticing
and
enjoyable
taste
is
a
proper
mix
between
some
candi
sugar
with
notes
of
fruity
ester
and
a
medium
sweet
malt
backbone
body
is
a
bit
light
for
style
with
great
carbonation
and
light
creamy
texture
which
is
quite
good
with
no
apparent
alcohol
very
nice
for
the
style
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
often
d
very
good
beer
classic
belgian
dubbel
when
all
is
said
and
done
this
beer
is
at
least
as
good
as
triple
and
blond
only
winter
also
known
as
grand
cru
is
superior
if
you
have
a
hankering
for
a
classic
belgian
dubbel
valdieu
brune
will
scratch
that
itch
will
no
trouble
at
all
alcohol
is
hidden
and
this
is
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
dubbels
i
have
had
drinkability
close
to
being
really
good
but
just
too
much
alcohol
flavor
there
there
are
definitely
better
dubbels
out
there
drinkability
a
solidly
drinkable
dubbel
i
could
easily
go
on
quaffing
this
all
night
d
very
drinkable
but
id
say
one
or
two
will
do
it
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
one
d
good
balance
for
all
the
big
flavors
masks
the
abv
fairly
well
buy
it
d
fairly
drinkable
and
pleasant
d
i
drank
about
half
of
this
and
then
drainpoured
it
best
by
date
was
a
year
from
now
so
im
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
not
but
i
was
not
happy
with
this
one
this
one
is
very
drinkable
for
a
8
beer
may
or
may
not
finish
this
during
the
final
four
this
is
a
dubbel
that
i
was
pleased
with
at
for
the
price
8
99
it
is
good
value
would
revisit
this
easily
d
very
high
in
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
anybody
could
get
used
to
have
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
awesome
d
i
was
through
my
bottle
in
a
flash
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
the
beers
strength
cant
be
felt
until
a
warm
feeling
hits
at
the
end
of
the
glass
a
very
nicely
put
together
beer
d
very
good
and
easy
going
dubbel
would
like
to
have
more
in
the
future
overall
an
absolutely
phenomenal
double
this
one
ranks
up
there
with
the
best
doubles
in
belgium
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
make
sure
to
pick
this
one
up
if
you
see
it
recommended
d
good
easy
sipper
notes
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
which
strikes
me
as
an
english
brown
ale
but
not
the
dubbel
that
it
has
been
assigned
not
sure
id
drink
a
lot
of
this
as
i
finish
this
i
have
no
urge
for
another
which
im
going
to
rate
as
average
since
its
a
dubbel
and
ive
never
ordered
a
second
dubbel
despite
my
fondness
for
the
style
taste
is
mild
but
clean
and
crisp
very
smooth
and
satisfying
afterall
its
a
dubbel
but
looks
like
a
quad
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
a
specific
fruit
but
sweet
taste
from
fruits
goes
down
easy
great
brew
ive
been
listening
about
this
beer
for
a
long
time
so
i
was
able
to
find
it
in
my
new
favorite
beer
store
in
switzerland
au
grain
dorge
something
like
at
the
barley
beans
back
to
the
beer
its
a
classic
belgian
double
dubbel
beer
first
of
all
quite
good
one
it
has
a
brownred
amber
color
and
smells
like
coffee
chocolate
and
brown
malt
quite
good
taste
that
would
be
better
if
we
could
feel
less
alcohol
in
average
satisfying
beer
looking
forward
to
taste
their
quad
one
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
mahogany
with
lots
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
faint
cocoa
powder
and
creamy
yeast
with
some
brown
sugar
and
a
slight
amount
of
lemon
hops
it
tasted
like
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
bready
yeast
and
some
cocoa
powder
and
a
bit
of
coffee
and
alcohol
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
with
good
scent
taste
and
body
it
wasnt
very
complex
or
bold
but
it
was
a
bit
unique
with
hints
of
a
stout
it
was
easy
to
drink
almost
seeming
like
a
session
beer
despite
weighing
in
at
8
abv
im
not
sure
if
age
would
improve
this
one
the
beer
was
interesting
and
enjoyable
once
but
im
not
sure
if
it
was
quite
good
enough
for
me
to
come
back
to
it
again
this
is
very
drinkable
the
8
is
evident
straight
away
but
because
of
its
richness
and
fullness
of
body
the
alcohol
doesnt
take
over
and
ruin
the
experience
poured
into
a
goblet
for
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
tan
head
and
some
lace
patches
an
intense
malt
smell
with
some
roasted
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
along
with
a
little
yeast
and
some
dark
fruits
tucked
in
there
great
smooth
and
creaminess
in
a
medium
body
with
caramel
chocolate
toffee
coffee
roasted
malts
along
with
figs
for
a
sticky
sweet
and
dry
finish
the
malts
dominate
but
there
are
some
fruits
like
orange
and
apple
pie
crust
as
well
for
that
dryish
bready
taste
with
hints
of
fruitiness
overall
a
sweet
malty
double
with
a
plethora
of
flavors
that
i
am
not
doing
justice
one
of
the
better
belgians
ive
had
and
great

it
was
looks
had
me
thinking
it
was
going

be

this

i
could

dangerous

a

brew
and
probably
a
good
one
to
give

to

with
quite
a
bit
of
subtle
complexities
to
it
a
delicious
dubbel
with
a
great
feel
poured
into
a
valdieu
chalice
a
dark
amberbrowncrimson
red
color
with
a
small
amount
of
foam
that
fell
into
a
nice
cap
and
left
behind
plenty
of
thick
lacing
aroma
of
chocolate
and
dark
bready
yeasty
notes
taste
is
similar
to
nose
toasted
bread
hints
of
bakers
chocolate
a
dry
yeasty
finish
semisweet
delicious
and
goes
down
quite
easily
im
not
generally
a
big
fan
of
dubbels
but
this
one
was
great
p
s
i
found
that
this
had
a
best
by
date
of
13
months
ago
i
am
guessing
that
it
was
kept
in
a
good
place
and
is
likely
to
be
a
style
of
beer
that
ages
well
d
this
beer
is
a
sipper
but
quite
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
shocked
that
is
was
free
i
was
actually
expecting
this
to
be
crap
but
it
turned
out
to
be
great
really
enjoyed
this
beer
d
i
found
it
drinkable
but
i
didnt
find
a
flavor
profile
that
really
begged
for
more
drinkability
easy
drinking
but
at
the
same
time
you
know
that
it
is
a
strong
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
this
was
one
tasty
beer
very
easy
drinking
the
bottle
went
by
way
to
quickly
highly
recommended
d
great
drinkability
factor
very
rich
and
highly
recommended
if
you
like
brown
ales
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
its
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
brune
if
they
kicked
up
the
aroma
on
this
beer
it
would
be
all
the
better
a
great
all
around
beer
but
not
one
ill
dream
about
on
my
deathbed
overall
out
of
the
three
beers
in
the
gift
set
blondetripel
and
brown
this
is
the
best
and
most
complex
worth
a
taste
im
sure
you
will
enjoy
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
with
minimal
off
white
head
if
you
pour
the
whole
bottle
in
sediment
and
all
you
get
a
cloudy
ruby
and
the
nose
is
noticeably
more
yeasty
nose
is
a
cross
of
old
grape
skins
and
cherries
with
a
syrup
edge
flavor
is
pretty
interesting
starts
off
tangy
and
almost
bitter
in
a
way
constant
sweet
tone
with
a
doughy
edge
to
it
towards
the
tail
end
with
all
the
sediment
in
there
the
subtle
changes
are
less
noticeable
and
it
tends
to
stay
an
even
slightly
caramel
brew
feel
has
a
great
level
of
carbonation
on
it
pretty
drinkable
though
that
8
will
get
to
ya
quick
ive
spent
too
much
time
deliberating
over
the
age
of
a
beer
lm
overgeeked
is
it
at
its
best
now
geez
what
a
pain
this
is
fresh
stuff
and
its
really
good
its
great
to
have
something
out
of
the
kettle
and
great
to
taste
i
feel
liberated
from
the
annoying
deliberation
of
appropriateness
drink
it
now
this
is
good
really
good
fresh
no
waiting
is
required
d
this
is
a
really
good
beer
very
tasty
ontap
surprised
me
a
little
bit
of
how
good
it
was
ill
definitely
order
this
again
a
great
brown
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
that
you
cannot
penetrate
leaves
nice
lacing
and
pours
pillowy
head
which
follows
your
sips
down
the
tulip
smells
of
peaches
apricots
and
pears
taste
is
very
fruity
twingy
pears
and
apricots
pleasure
the
taste
buds
very
warming
nice
fallwinter
brew
pretty
drinkable
although
high
in
alcohol
does
have
a
slight
alcohol
taste
that
can
be
perceived
as
unpleasant
is
very
sour
as
well
a
decent
overall
dubbel
finish
is
medium
long
and
rather
sweet
more
cola
on
the
finish
very
nice
dthis
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
this
is
dangerously
good
not
really
sweet
it
was
more
bitter
with
high
quality
cocoa
beingn
the
dominant
flavour
very
nicely
done
good
redbrown
bodied
beer
there
was
a
bit
of
head
as
i
was
pouring
but
it
disappeared
quickly
leaving
no
trace
of
its
presence
nice
malty
aroma
there
is
a
bit
of
spice
in
there
and
some
breadiness
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
that
same
bit
of
spice
but
it
is
a
bit
think
and
lacks
the
intensity
that
id
like
the
spice
seems
to
take
over
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
body
is
also
not
quite
where
it
should
be
it
is
fairly
light
for
a
dubbel
a
decent
beer
all
around
but
not
among
my
favorite
dubbels
but
the
yeast
taste
was
not
as
strong
and
stinggy
like
many
belgian
blonds
dark
malts
and
very
subtle
sweetness
in
addition
to
a
slight
breadiness
was
detected
as
it
moves
into
a
grassy
yeasty
taste
on
the
finish
which
is
reminiscent
of
the
initial
smell
the
finish
was
also
very
slightly
bitter
i
did
not
think
i
detected
much
of
fruits
in
the
taste
but
in
the
after
taste
i
believe
i
pick
up
plums
and
grapes
with
some
breadiness
a
little
fruity
aroma
on
the
nose
as
well
beer
was
of
a
moderage
body
with
a
sufficiently
high
carbonation
level
it
was
smooth
but
instead
of
creamy
smooth
which
was
what
it
looked
to
be
it
was
more
of
the
watery
smooth
it
was
a
relatively
refreshing
compared
to
many
of
the
belgian
brunes
as
well
on
the
whole
i
find
that
this
beer
was
more
like
a
blond
than
a
brune
though
every
inch
of
it
looks
like
a
brune
quite
interesting
though
i
would
have
preferred
it
more
like
a
brune
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brasserie
v
in
madison
wi
a
new
restaurant
and
tap
room
really
a
great
place
a
constant
rotation
of
15
beers
on
tap
most
of
them
belgian
imports
served
in
its
own
goblet
this
beer
was
a
lighter
brown
color
and
smelt
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
overtones
a
solid
belgian
yeast
taste
with
a
bit
more
of
a
roasty
character
than
other
dubbels
ive
had
a
very
solid
beer
but
at
8
its
not
a
session
beer
very
tasty
wonderful
beer
750ml
bottle
served
in
a
goblet
dark
redbrown
in
color
with
a
thick
head
that
retains
very
well
dark
fruit
chocolate
and
caramel
in
the
aroma
very
yeasty
and
malty
taste
with
the
fruits
and
a
little
coffee
also
a
real
mouthful
but
a
great
beer
to
savor
alcohol
not
noticeable
cheers
i
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
from
garys
liquor
in
the
oc
oak
creek
wi
i
didnt
know
exactly
what
to
expect
although
i
was
anticipating
an
abbey
dubbel
that
would
be
spiced
with
coriander
and
clove
instead
i
got
a
beer
that
redder
in
color
than
i
anticipated
it
is
called
a
brown
on
the
label
more
earthy
and
cherryish
in
flavor
than
i
thought
and
to
be
honest
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
good
bit
more
than
i
thought
i
would
d
its
good
i
could
have
a
couple
but
not
for
the
four
bucks
i
paid
for
this
twelver
there
are
much
better
dubbels
out
there
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
the
aroma
was
malty
with
loads
of
dried
fruits
the
taste
was
greatly
complex
featuring
dried
fruits
molasses
coffee
with
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
as
well
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
the
alcohol
was
not
too
strong
at
all
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
d
a
very
good
dubbel
this
was
the
first
ive
had
from
valdieu
and
it
is
yet
another
good
belgian
beer
gave
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
and
was
not
disappointed
brew
was
poured
into
a
duval
glass
and
had
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
had
great
retention
actually
had
a
head
the
entire
time
and
left
sheets
of
lace
down
the
side
if
the
glass
aroma¬ís
of
toasted
and
roasted
maltsgrains
are
noticeable
right
away
but
also
tend
to
have
a
sweet
smell
while
also
picking
up
some
darker
scents
almost
like
fresh
ground
coffee
this
is
a
fantastic
aromatic
brew
the
taste
is
very
inviting
very
smooth
with
a
sweet
taste
upfront
that
seems
to
have
some
brown
sugar
properties
the
malts
really
seem
to
give
it
a
good
roasted
flavor
that
tends
to
be
quite
robust
giving
it
a
darker
feel
at
the
end
hops
are
slightly
noticeable
and
give
it
great
balance
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
i
really
wish
i
would
have
tried
it
a
long
time
ago
this
one
is
a
keeper
most
of
all
this
beer
has
a
blindingly
good
smell
that
changes
from
start
to
finish
but
stays
amazing
this
with
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
real
champagne
come
to
think
of
it
i
might
have
to
break
out
my
chisel
to
remove
the
dried
lace
from
my
glass
true
the
taste
could
be
fullerbodied
and
the
smell
could
hold
up
better
at
warmth
against
the
malts
but
really
this
is
what
belgian
browns
are
all
about
cheers
d
excellent
interplay
between
the
flavors
and
aromas
the
alcohol
presence
is
felt
but
its
not
intrusive
very
nice
balance
the
roasted
flavors
make
this
a
very
interesting
dubbel
d
smooth
easy
to
drink
lots
more
going
on
in
this
beer
than
ive
noted
here
but
definitely
worth
another
round
or
two
to
find
more
poured
this
out
of
a
bottle
immediately
noticed
a
dark
brown
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
surprisingly
average
i
would
have
expected
a
stronger
smoky
smell
as
for
the
taste
it
was
a
good
kind
of
bitter
it
had
an
intense
level
of
carbonation
it
was
so
strong
that
i
nearly
coughed
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
considering
it
was
8
abv
one
could
not
notice
it
i
would
be
able
to
a
few
in
one
sitting
i
would
have
it
again
overall
a
really
good
dubbel
a
bit
underwhelming
on
the
finish
or
for
longterm
drinking
but
quite
good
overall
recommended
served
in
my
valdieu
chalice
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
caramel
and
sweet
malt
it
tastes
like
caramel
nuts
dark
fruit
and
then
has
a
slight
fruity
sour
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
it
being
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
at
the
same
time
carbonation
is
moderate
not
too
high
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
easy
to
drink
and
the
8
abv
is
well
hidden
but
catches
up
to
you
after
a
while
overall
i
think
its
a
good
beer
id
drink
it
again
pours
a
deep
dark
dense
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
dissipated
all
too
quickly
nose
is
of
malt
and
fruit
taste
is
malty
sweet
leading
to
a
dry
fruity
finish
mediumbodied
and
good
carbonation
feels
good
in
the
mouth
a
very
drinkable
belgian
could
easily
have
a
few
perfect
drinkability
the
8
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
what
a
great
beer
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
head
the
smell
is
very
malty
and
caramel
like
the
taste
is
strong
of
malt
with
a
touch
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
balanced
with
high
carbonation
that
gives
an
interesting
sensation
in
the
mouth
id
never
heard
of
this
beer
before
today
but
must
say
im
very
pleased
and
will
be
looking
for
another
soon
this
ones
been
in
my
fridge
for
four
years
served
into
a
chimay
chalice
still
well
carbonated
the
cork
comes
out
with
a
pop
and
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
firm
tan
head
nose
is
malty
with
fruit
notes
like
apricot
and
a
subtle
spiciness
underneath
it
malt
is
lighter
in
the
flavor
than
the
nose
but
pleasantly
bready
tart
fruity
notes
amount
apricot
and
peach
like
to
my
tongue
bitterness
is
on
the
low
side
but
a
light
acidity
balances
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
body
feels
surprisingly
light
and
crisp
not
the
best
dubbel
i
ever
had
but
decent
in
a
small
goblet
forms
a
little
glass
ring
of
light
tan
bubbles
over
a
dark
rubybrown
body
the
nose
is
full
of
slight
tart
cherries
caramel
and
berries
taste
is
mildly
sour
with
a
bit
of
an
alcoholic
taste
the
flavors
in
the
nose
show
up
in
the
taste
but
to
a
lesser
extent
the
mouth
is
light
with
adequate
carbonation
a
mild
sour
dubbel
this
is
a
very
pretty
beer
it
pours
with
a
delicate
eggshell
head
that
sticks
and
sticks
and
a
body
of
layered
gradually
deepening
mahogany
heavily
phenolic
nose
with
some
dates
and
clove
in
the
background
on
the
palate
slight
light
sweetness
up
front
nuttiness
in
the
midpalate
and
slightly
sour
fruits
toward
the
end
the
finish
is
grainy
like
some
scotch
whiskies
lightness
in
mouthfeel
is
sustained
throughout
very
drinkable
with
light
not
syrupy
flavors
and
not
too
much
abv
drinkability
this
is
good
and
id
have
one
more
in
any
given
session
but
its
not
really
a
session
beer
and
anyway
high
abv
would
limit
drinkability
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
though
not
as
complex
and
fullflavored
as
some
other
belgians
ive
drunk
recently
slightly
lighter
flavor
might
make
this
good
summer
drinking
or
alternately
commend
this
to
those
people
who
like
craft
brews
but
not
big
beers
this
is
enjoyable
to
drink
with
a
slick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
not
typically
characteristic
to
this
style
a
unique
belgian
brown
second
only
to
leffe
brune
in
my
opinion
certainly
worth
buying
trying
a
few
given
the
opportunity
a
subtle
masterwork
poured
from
a
small
stub
bottle
this
beer
has
a
massive
quiltlike
head
thick
and
offwhite
the
head
leaves
an
enchanting
lace
the
color
of
the
liquid
is
a
deep
mahogany
small
bits
of
yeast
float
happily
in
the
brew
but
there
really
isn¬ít
any
¬ëcloudiness¬í
the
aroma
is
intense
and
multidimensional
lots
of
fruit
and
yeast
spicy
phenols
and
a
little
sugar
caramel
and
fresh
dark
bread
the
smell
has
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
mix
as
well
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
thick
doughy
quality
nice
bitterness
to
balance
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
beer
is
just
a
little
slick
on
the
tongue
mediumfull
body
soft
and
with
fair
complexity
this
is
a
satisfying
beer
brewing
returned
to
the
abbey
grounds
in
1996
making
this
the
only
nontrappist
monastery
in
belgium
where
beer
is
produced
however
no
monks
brew
in
fact
none
live
at
valdieu
christian
families
who
offer
the
grounds
as
a
place
for
retreat
manage
the
complex
presentation
packaged
in
a
22
ounce
brown
glass
bomber
with
a
cork
and
cage
closure
served
in
a
belgian
chalice
mediumlight
body
moderate
carbonation
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
to
me
taste
starts
off
with
dark
roasted
malts
choclate
and
caramel
and
just
a
bit
on
the
sugary
side
the
dark
fruits
come
out
nicely
but
melds
well
with
the
little
bit
of
alcohol
that
comes
through
theres
a
bit
of
spices
with
some
corriander
and
maybe
some
cloves
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
thrown
into
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
medum
bodied
even
with
the
sweetness
the
drinkablitly
is
pretty
high
on
this
one
pours
out
looking
like
suede
leather
with
a
miniscule
but
very
frothy
white
head
some
pleasant
lace
is
found
very
low
carbonation
aromas
are
spicy
and
smell
richly
of
fruits
banana
grapes
pears
theres
a
soft
sweetness
in
the
nose
that
reminds
me
of
fruitfilled
pastries
slight
alcohol
plays
well
with
all
that
im
smelling
i
dont
get
nearly
as
much
yeasty
spice
from
the
taste
as
i
did
with
the
aromas
which
is
good
im
not
too
fond
of
overly
phenolic
dubbels
tastes
very
much
like
that
pastry
scent
i
got
earlier
like
fruitfilled
sweetbread
also
tastes
strongly
of
grapes
not
so
much
vinous
as
of
the
unfermented
juice
the
alcohol
is
present
enough
to
offer
some
sort
of
balance
to
the
sweet
as
i
really
dont
pick
up
anything
in
the
way
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
as
the
visual
lack
of
carbonation
would
suggest
is
very
mellow
but
seems
kind
of
light
this
abbey
goes
down
quick
but
sits
a
bit
heavy
on
the
stomach
although
this
is
working
as
a
nice
digestif
if
i
was
forced
to
use
one
word
to
sum
up
this
beer
id
use
adequate
not
average
as
that
implies
toeing
the
minimalist
line
this
is
good
though
nothing
to
remember
pour
is
nice
murky
brown
with
a
minor
white
head
nose
is
floral
with
white
grapes
and
sugar
nothing
to
do
a
double
take
over
taste
is
pretty
good
brown
sugar
caramel
rose
petals
and
sugar
mixed
with
spices
good
but
not
one
youll
search
for
when
looking
for
a
good
belgian
mouthfeel
is
again
servicable
i
could
have
another
but
wouldnt
be
sad
if
the
answer
was
none
left
decent
brew
that
makes
little
impression
drinkability
if
easier
found
this
would
be
one
of
my
go
to
dubbels
worth
the
4
i
paid
for
it
poured
a
deep
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
few
small
floaties
swirling
around
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
lace
behind
as
it
settles
into
a
creamy
froth
aromas
are
spiced
like
that
of
cinnamon
and
phenolic
clove
a
touch
of
sweet
cookie
dough
as
well
a
smooth
creamylike
mouthfeel
lends
well
to
the
rich
flavors
of
this
beer
somewhat
clovey
and
light
sweet
a
touch
of
semisweet
chocolate
but
not
overbearing
finishing
with
a
slight
dryness
not
a
bad
dubbel
i
dont
drink
many
of
this
stylethis
one
i
enjoyed
drinkability
quite
good
a
bit
sweet
but
what
dubbel
isnt
but
very
robust
balanced
and
controlled
a
solid
offering
from
this
somewhat
obscure
brewer
body
hovers
just
below
medium
with
a
sticky
mouthfeel
and
expansive
bubbly
texture
no
trace
of
the
8
abv
rather
high
for
this
style
again
very
easy
to
put
down
a
750
meself
would
pair
nicely
with
a
burger
or
game
drinkability
hell
yes
i
can
have
another
and
maybe
another
the
alcohol
presence
is
hardly
felt
and
when
it
is
it
works
well
and
is
never
even
close
to
overdone
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
now
no
punches
are
pulled
with
having
everything
over
the
top
but
its
extremely
well
balanced
and
dangerously
drinkable
taste
is
like
winelaced
coffee
a
roasted
coffee
alcohol
isnt
too
overwhelming
but
definitely
present
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
a
bit
tooo
oily
for
me
overall
tasty
but
far
too
sweet
near
the
finish
and
alcoholic
to
drink
a
lot
of
a
bit
out
of
balance
this
one
as
i
sat
back
and
drank
this
i
got
a
feel
that
this
was
the
table
beer
for
a
belgian
monastery
not
a
grande
reserve
complex
celebratory
brew
or
seasonal
feast
beer
but
this
was
an
ale
that
was
to
eat
supper
with
to
drink
for
sustenance
and
everyday
fulfillment
that
being
said
this
was
absolutely
superb
fantastically
drinkable
the
only
detractor
at
all
was
some
of
the
citrus
or
funky
yeast
twang
but
as
the
glass
warms
and
oxygenates
that
as
well
is
forgiven
d
very
drinkable
in
the
end
i
thought
this
was
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
dubbel
i
enjoyed
the
smoothness
of
the
mouthfeel
alcohol
was
subtle
well
put
together
brew
the
best
part
was
that
the
label
said
brown
and
it
tasted
brown
if
that
makes
any
kind
of
sense
drinkability
decent
but
i
feel
it
is
lacking
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
complexity
to
be
among
the
very
best
dubbels
a
good
dubbel
and
although
there
are
better
beers
available
in
this
style
this
one
is
still
wellworth
a
try
cheers
medium
body
fruity
aftertaste
of
dark
fruit
thick
bodied
the
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
but
never
overwhelming
fitting
properly
with
what
isnt
too
strong
of
a
beer
either
quite
pleasant
either
way
this
is
a
really
bad
dubble
actually
one
of
the
worst
ive
had
boo
pass
on
this
one
aged
just
wonderfully
same
gentle
but
full
flavor
the
yeast
element
has
faded
out
a
bit
replaced
by
a
bit
of
cork
but
no
papery
oxidation
cant
say
that
its
gotten
better
but
certainly
held
up
nicely
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
the
mouthfeel
is
moderatefull
the
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
just
a
wee
bit
towards
the
finish
goes
down
easy
and
is
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
taste
is
good
and
strong
too
dark
caramelmalt
taste
sweet
full
and
litle
spicy
make
it
a
complex
taste
thats
balanced
and
i
can
apriciate
mouthfeel
is
as
good
as
the
taste
and
drinkability
is
also
good
if
you
want
to
enjoy
and
not
just
booze
good
brew
that
i
can
recomend
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
and
perhaps
having
again
with
the
right
meal
overall
its
slightly
above
average
i
then
drank
some
expecting
a
good
beer
but
wow
this
was
a
dessert
in
a
glass
no
hops
i
could
find
but
i
wasnt
looking
for
them
the
aroma
was
intense
from
the
pumping
action
the
taste
just
burst
through
with
malty
roasty
goodness
chocolate
and
dark
candied
fruits
not
too
rich
though
just
filling
and
pleasing
each
sip
getting
better
than
the
one
before
it
just
an
incredible
experience
an
incredible
beer
experience
i
was
really
sad
when
i
finished
this
one
because
i
knew
i
wouldnt
find
anything
else
i
liked
as
much
afterward
drinkability
definately
a
beer
i
could
consume
regularly
under
these
conditions
ie
the
hand
pump
a
decent
belgium
and
an
easy
drink
lots
of
lace
aroma
of
yeast
and
bit
of
spice
sediment
bittersweet
malts
and
balanced
with
hops
medium
mouthfeel
some
sugar
and
carmel
a
bit
complex
some
coffee
and
mint
i
have
had
better
in
this
style
but
this
is
satisfying
bottle
purchased
from
beermania
in
brussels
poured
into
chimay
goblet
really
wonderful
color
though
the
head
was
thin
and
short
lived
color
was
a
reassuringly
consistent
bronze
taste
was
light
and
fruity
but
then
fell
off
almost
immediately
second
and
third
sips
felt
weak
and
flat
i
may
have
chilled
it
too
much
but
even
after
letting
it
warm
to
something
closer
to
room
temperature
the
character
was
the
same
sad
to
say
that
i
wound
up
pouring
half
of
it
out
am
hoping
that
my
next
review
will
have
better
results
drinkable
but
unremarkable
i
see
thelongbeachbum
comments
and
i
might
have
gotten
a
bottle
with
a
bad
air
seal
or
something
i
will
have
to
try
another
bottle
from
a
different
store
recommended
drinkability
is
high
amber
brown
body
was
a
bit
hazy
the
head
was
small
in
size
and
short
lived
the
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
was
thin
but
sticky
the
aroma
was
typical
dubbel
with
spices
brown
sugar
roasty
malt
and
cookie
dough
the
taste
was
just
what
the
aroma
promised
with
a
sweet
and
spicy
front
a
dry
roasty
middle
and
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
alcohol
is
strong
at
8
but
is
not
apparent
in
the
flavor
profile
this
is
a
nice
beer
fitting
very
nicely
among
the
now
crowded
rows
of
belgian
style
bottles
lining
the
shelves
of
green¬ís
sharp
and
biting
at
first
then
warming
on
the
tongue
with
pear
like
quality
finishes
slightly
bitter
but
this
is
an
exceptionally
well
balanced
beer
very
good
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
mountainous
tan
head
that
very
slowly
dissipates
in
chunks
leaving
behind
a
rocky
head
of
lace
that
remains
until
the
very
end
nose
is
dark
bread
spicy
yeast
and
a
bit
of
earthy
tobacco
moderate
in
body
and
fairly
smooth
in
texture
taste
begins
with
caramelized
malts
and
molasses
followed
by
some
unsweetened
dark
chocolate
and
some
slightly
bitter
woody
and
leathery
notes
some
bitter
hops
and
traces
of
alcohol
are
present
towards
the
finish
pretty
nice
dubbel
though
i
prefer
their
tripel
served
at
cellar
temperature
in
a
chimay
chalice
the
cork
had
a
date
0904
for
what
thats
worth
it
poured
a
super
dark
maroon
with
a
beige
head
it
had
a
malty
aroma
laced
with
dark
chocolate
tastes
were
malt
lemon
leather
chocolate
clove
cinnamon
raisin
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
light
carbonation
as
i
drank
the
beer
left
dense
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
it
finished
with
malt
leather
lemonpeel
and
clove
maybe
not
the
best
belgian
ive
ever
had
but
well
worth
having
again
and
again
and
again
since
the
bar
i
tend
in
stopped
carrying
these
a
year
ago
i
end
up
getting
them
from
the
v
c
quite
often
and
thats
what
i
have
to
say
about
the
drinkability
chocolate
coffee
dark
fruits
and
frosting
were
all
around
this
was
pretty
well
hopped
belgian
as
well
however
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
to
thin
in
the
mouth
for
it
to
taste
great
sampled
at
from
the
vine
beer
tasting
jan
9th
2004
its
not
often
that
i
get
to
try
two
beers
in
a
row
with
the
word
dieu
in
them
the
beer
is
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
medium
thick
and
somewhat
creamy
white
head
decent
lacing
the
aroma
consists
of
faint
nuts
and
malt
medium
bodied
and
bubbly
with
lots
of
malt
and
alcohol
at
first
then
accompanied
by
hops
and
raisin
flavors
shortly
after
the
finish
is
mostly
fruity
alcohol
with
a
touch
of
sourness
not
too
bad
on
tap
at
lucky
baldwins
its
brown
with
just
a
trace
of
red
when
held
to
the
light
the
offwhite
head
sits
on
top
like
whipped
cream
every
time
the
glass
moves
waves
of
foam
work
their
way
up
the
side
of
the
glass
an
earthy
smell
and
aroma
are
backed
by
a
sugary
rush
that
has
undertones
of
banana
and
other
fruit
but
is
mainly
just
pure
unadulterated
sweetness
this
seems
a
bit
of
a
strange
combination
but
it
all
comes
together
very
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
reminiscent
of
a
milk
shake
this
is
one
fine
beer

9

with
lots
of

and
a

mouthfeel

alcohol
is
well
concealed
here
pleasant

maltiness
sustains
all
the
way
through
without
any

or
distractions
very
enjoyable
with
a
belgian
cheese
plate
sampler
finish
is
slightly
dry
with
a
green
apple
aftertaste
very
versatile
brew
and
nicely
balanced
lush
deep
brown
touch
of
red
color
with
a
thick
tan
colored
head
aromas
of
dark
malts
yeast
candi
sugar
and
some
complex
esters
sweet
malt
texture
turning
to
a
slightly
sour
taste
in
the
finish
and
a
dryness
perhaps
from
some
bittering
hops
a
little
raisiny
and
thin
but
overall
a
good
belgian
brown
i
sampled
this
one
from
the
33
cl
hopefully
the
75
cl
one
i
have
is
even
better
the
head
is
mediumsized
in
my
tulip
glass
its
dense
stable
offwhite
and
leaves
lots
of
sticky
thick
sheety
lacing
beer
is
a
clear
dark
redbrown
with
tons
of
carbonation
smell
is
nutty
with
fruit
and
some
dark
malt
front
is
spicy
with
loads
of
fruit
the
milky
sweet
lightish
middle
dies
off
with
grains
and
alcohol
theres
a
very
nice
bready
aftertaste
this
beer
is
very
very
drinkable
tasty
light
fresh
fruity
nutty
yum
the
flavor
is
fruity
that
lingers
long
into
the
aftertaste
the
malt
flavor
reminds
me
of
amber
malt
or
biscuit
malt
the
body
is
a
little
thin
maybe
due
to
the
higher
alcohol
the
drinkability
is
what
i
have
to
give
the
lowest
it
just
isnt
there
for
me
ah
shit
all
over
my
laptop
this
is
one
fiesty
beer
i
left
it
puking
its
guts
in
the
sink
for
a
minute
before
i
decided
to
just
pour
it
in
my
chalice
thats
better
so
what
do
we
have
here
a
belgian
that
doesnt
hold
its
head
oh
man
yeah
its
definitely
brown
pretty
dark
brown
and
a
little
cloudy
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
a
clear
belgian
i
smell
alcoholic
raisins
mellowed
by
a
light
coffee
aroma
it
really
feels
like
soft
fleece
on
the
tongue
not
quite
like
a
nitro
stout
but
damn
close
the
taste
is
hard
to
describe
there
is
definitely
some
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
definitely
a
lot
of
malt
not
much
hops
that
i
can
detect
maybe
just
a
little
bittering
from
some
hops
not
sure
i
just
cant
put
a
finger
on
the
taste
its
kind
of
like
a
brown
aleon
steroids
strong
and
complex
i
thought
this
beer
was
good
but
it
didn¬ít
blow
me
away
like
it
did
when
i
first
had
it
it
might
have
been
that
the
vintages
were
different
or
more
likely
that
i¬íve
just
developed
a
more
refined
palate
either
way
i
lowered
a
couple
of
the
scores
a
little
bit
and
actually
raised
the
smell
by
half
a
point
it¬ís
still
overall
a
4
0
beer
that
i
will
definitely
seek
out
and
buy
again
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
the
head
did
last
through
the
drink
there
was
a
slight
yeast
and
sweet
aroma
which
translated
into
the
flavor
components
there
seemed
to
be
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
this
sports
an
average
thickeness
making
this
extremely
drinkable
pours
with
a
fivefingered
plus
faint
brownthick
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves

this
is
one
decent
dubbel
in
my
opinion
dark
brown
and
cloudy
with
an
enormous
frothy
head
and
fantastic
retention
aroma
is
fruity
spicy
sugary
and
malty
has
a
great
full
body
and
goes
down
quite
smooth
with
none
of
the
8
noticable
at
all

although
not
as
complex
as
others
is
a
good
malty

sweet
yummy
brew
dayton
oh
alefestthis
beer
had
a
small
sized
tan
head
that
consisted
of
mostly
lasting
fine
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
cloudy
with
no
carbonation
observed
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
brown
with
a
nose
of
malts
and
some
hops
the
flavor
was
acidic
and
bitter
which
had
a
lingering
effect
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
very
tingly
thin
watery
and
light
bodied
there
was
good
lacing
with
this
beer
nice
enough
though
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
sized
thick
head
dies
flat
shortly
after
and
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
reminds
me
slightly
of
a
wheat
beer
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
and
spicy
but
very
smooth
it
is
very
malty
in
taste
and
it
finished
up
with
a
wheat
flavor
pretty
decent
belgian
brown
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
fluffy

head
approx

head
calms
down
in
a
few
minutes
and
lacing
is
consistent
throughout
the
beer
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
traces
of
light
can
be
seen
through
the
glass
but
this
is
definitely
darker
than
most
brown
ales
ive
had
the
smell
is
exceedingly
sweet
and
perfumey
two
of
my
favorite
worlds
collide
here
its
a
cross
between
an
english
brown
ale
and
a
belgian
artisinal
with
a
nice
sweetness
that
balances
perfectly
with
a
mild
hoppy
bitterness
aftertaste
is
sweet
this
one
stands
out
for
me
its
sweet
its
bitter
its
belgian
and
its
good
a
thin
mouthfeel
it
slides
down
awful
easy
and
is
lightly
warming
well
done
for
a
belgian
¬ìbrune¬î
but
not
a
commanding
presence
much
thanks
to
johnnyduvel
for
helping
a

out
the

this

solid
beer
nonetheless
oh

pours
a
medium
brown

benediction
is
an
interesting
beer
i
was
half
expecting
it
to
be
sour
based
on
the
name
but
its
a
thin
belgian
dubbel
but
only
loosely
its
maple
syrup
colored
and
with
an
inch
of
off
white
head
almost
nitro
looking
the
nose
is
not
as
belgian
yeasty
as
anticipated
more
of
a
slight
banana
fruit
thing
there
is
more
of
a
dried
rasion
thing
and
some
abbey
malt
in
here
on
the
taste
its
both
sweet
and
dry
one
than
the
other
but
it
seems
watered
down
by
normal
standards
for
the
style
in
both
body
and
alcohol
its
real
drinkable
which
is
cool
but
it
is
also
unsatisfying
for
the
same
reason
i
like
to
drink
these
slow
and
let
them
warm
up
and
warm
me
up
this
one
is
a
little
incapable
of
the
latter
good
beer
well
made
no
doubt
but
not
really
satisfying
the
elements
of
the
style
that
make
it
special
in
my
opinion
nice
abbey
style
with
good
yeast
color
is
true
to
fit
lacing
is
very
nice
lacks
a
little
on
the
flavor
side
but
is
well
made
and
finishes
good
probably
would
rather
have
a
better
beer
but
if
you
like
belgian
and
its
around
then
go
for
it

this
wasnt
my
favorite
at

but
i
thought
it
was
solid
nice
to
be
able
to
try
this
as
i
dont
think
this
makes
it
out
to
denver
and
it
certainly
isnt
bottled
tasty

simple

another
big
tick
on
my
russian
river
tion
quest
to
try
them
all
slowly
but
surely
working
my
way
through
some
of
the
stragglers
big
thanks
goes
out
to
bilbosnuts
for
this
one
served
from
growler
into
a
green
man
snifter
i
think
i
left
my
tion
glass
in
florida
at
aashers
wedding
opened
with
a
huge
pop
poured
a
deep
ruby
red
brown
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
dark
fruit
smoke
bread
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
smoke
fruit
bread
dark
fruit
subtle
earth
and
subtle
spice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
there
was
quite
a
bit
going
on
in
this
one
that
definitely
kept
me
guessing
throughout
each
sip
i
went
into
it
based
on
the
style
knowing
what
to
expect
but
this
one
actually
surprised
me
slightly
the
smoke
note
carried
on
throughout
the
glass
which
was
a
very
nice
touch
that
brought
another
level
of
complexity
to
my
palate
that
i
always
love
to
find
with
a
nice
touch
of
roastiness
going
on
with
dark
fruit
profile
this
was
definitely
one
that
im
glad
i
finally
got
the
chance
to
try
hopefully
i
will
get
to
try
the
rest
eventually
get
on
brewing
those
up
for
me
russian
river
i
will
be
waiting
it
poured
a
caramel
amber
color
with
a
malty
bubblegum
banana
aroma
some
raisins
join
the
gang
once
tasted
and
that
cloying
malty
aftertaste
appropriate
for
the
style
yet
just
not
my
thing
o
a
worthy
attempt
but
while
competent
uninteresting
perhaps
a
bit
stale
flat
dull
anyway
id
drink
another
but
probably
not
if
i
were
paying
for
it
eh
overall
im
unimpressed
this
is
a
dull
example
of
a
dubbel
and
even
taken
on
its
own
without
the
repertoire
of
the
style
to
compare
it
to
its
not
that
interesting
o
sweet
and
dark
not
overly
heavy
enjoyable
but
not
crazy
good
i
dont
normally
like
dubbels
but
im
a
fan
of
this
one
some
good
flavors
with
a
bit
of
spices
mixed
in
a
belgian
beer
is
brewed
well
by
rrbc
the
sun
rises
in
the
morning
i
like
beer
o
very
good
dubbel
and
better
than
i
was
expecting
smooth
too
and
not
too
sweet
great
spicy
hoppy
and
fruity
flavors
well
done
o
good
not
that
i
would
expect
anything
less
from
russian
river
however
its
not
crazy
good
jd
draft
russian
river
pliny
the
younger
2010
release
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgianstyle
ale
from
rr
but
its
a
bit
boring
particularly
for
the
brewery
its
a
orangeamber
beer
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
malt
flavors
bring
a
lot
of
fruitiness
to
the
beer
there
are
peaches
apricots
apples
dates
and
figs
however
despite
all
that
it
has
a
relatively
simple
flavor
and
not
enough
earthiness
or
depth
a
good
beer
but
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
o
very
drinkable
not
bad
overall
though
dont
come
looking
for
authenticity
or
slavish
adherence
to
tradition
notes
while
the
nose
isnt
the
best
to
me
this
beer
is
all
about
flavor
and
really
good
balance
between
sweetness
bitterness
and
spiciness
pours
a
clear
light
brownish
into
the
chimay
goblet
very
nice
fluffy
finger
thick
head
sits
atop
with
some
good
staying
power
smell
is
mildly
sweet
more
on
the
sugary
side
than
the
fruity
side
as
ive
noticed
in
many
other
dubbels
ie
grapes
the
taste
was
a
balance
between
bready
and
sweet
not
too
far
off
in
one
direction
super
easy
to
drink
if
not
a
taste
bud
blaster
in
any
way
mouthfeel
was
good
medium
or
on
the
heavier
side
of
light
could
drink
this
baby
all
night
and
not
have
a
problem
with
it
nicely
carbonated
fairly
light
bodied
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
love
belgian
style
beers
in
this
abv
range
since
they
afford
me
the
opportunity
to
have
several
servings
bottle
it
already
draught
at
the
brewery
dark
amber
with
a
white
head
lightly
yeasty
aroma
with
caramel
and
light
bubblegum
going
on
as
well
the
flavor
has
a
lightly
sweet
caramel
and
bready
crust
malt
profile
with
light
yeasty
flavors
and
a
spicy
hoppy
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
malt
yeast
and
hop
mix
is
pretty
tasty
d
goes
down
really
nicely
and
smoothly
id
like
to
have
this
again
the
taste
is
excellent
fairly
assertive
yet
restrained
wellrounded
balanced
and
fairly
complex
it
is
raisiny
with
stewed
caramelised
pears
a
hint
of
dried
fig
fruity
grain
toastiness
a
little
light
red
wine
raisiny
spiciness
and
hint
of
pepper
it
has
a
consistent
sweetness
balanced
with
light
bitterness
and
spicey
warmth
it
has
an
aftertaste
of
caramelised
toast
and
fresh
plums
the
elements
are
wellintegrated
and
wellrounded
and
overall
it
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
by
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
country
they
never
let
me
down
and
this
beer
kept
with
my
high
expectations
great
job
a
really
solid
dubbel
here
that
was
much
more
hoppedup
for
the
style
than
im
used
to
but
hey
its
russian
river
the
feel
and
drinkibility
are
what
really
made
this
for
me
though
nice

a
good
drinking
beer
have
liked
it
more
than
most
dubbels
that
i
have
tried
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
excellent
example
of
an
american
dubble

i
will
drink
this
again
for

i
would

drinkability
is
good
a
pretty
nice
dubbel
but
this
one
didnt
quite
meet
the
high
expectations
that
it
seems
to
come
with
every
russian
river
beer
still
definitely
a
solid
beverage
that
i
am
not
at
all
upset
that
i
got
to
try
taste
mouthfeel
malt
forward
without
being
terribly
sweet
detracting
and
somewhat
astringent
husky
grain
flavor
that
really
doesnt
fit
the
style
yeasty
nice
mix
of
fruit
and
spice
in
the
background
dry
finish
not
bad
a
little
underwhelming

with

of

dark
candi
sugar
various
other
dark
fruits
british
christmas
cake
and
clove
spices
and
various
yeast
tinged
esthers
of
goodness
this
is
pretty
much
the
best
american
dubbel
ever
made
in
fact
it
may
even
be
the
best
dubbel
ever
made
taste
follows
through
big
time
with
a
blast
of
yeast
flavor
and
a
great
malty
roastiness
going
on
in
the
back
that
just
mixed
fantastically
with
all
of
the
spicysweet
notes
that
are
dominating
the
front
pallate
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
very
refined
carbonation
drinkability
remains
phenomenal
totally
killer
i
wish
they
actually
brought
this
one
out
more
often
though
from
my
notes
on
recent
trip
poured
into
a
sampling
glass
arrived
a
brownish
amber
with
minimal
head
actually
looks
flat
and
dead
aroma
is
completely
different
bananas
and
clove
and
spices
and
plum
and
what
a
rush
taste
is
just
as
good
damn
i
love
dubbels
again
with
the
clove
and
banana
and
plum
and
malts
and
just
delicious
smooth
mouthfeel
yet
a
little
springy
on
the
tongue
actually
would
love
to
drink
this
all
night
long
though
yad
get
trashed
pretty
quick
and
wouldnt
even
realize
it
good
brew
drinkability
pretty
tasty
served
ontap
at
union
jack
on
the
manatawny
served
in
a
snifter
glass
presented
as
a
medium
amber
colored
beverage
with
moderate
light
brown
puffy
head
smell
was
extremely
pleasant
being
a
nice
fruity
mixture
of
bananas
and
dark
fruit
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
the
taste
surpassed
the
smell
with
the
cloviness
and
the
malts
being
extraordinarily
pleasurable
a
bit
of
hoppiness
also
present
finishes
as
smooth
as
silk
with
a
nice
creaminess
that
is
the
pwerfect
ending
to
the
beer
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
the
taste
is
even
more
impressive
than
the
aroma
i
get
the
banana
and
clove
taste
that
others
have
stated
they
get
this
is
such
a
good
dubbel
that
i
had
to
have
a
few
more
it
is
very
drinkable
as
the
sweetness
and
some
hoppy
backnotes
mix
well
in
your
mouth
and
may
for
a
very
enjoyable
drinking
experience
well
done
russian
river
well
done
drinkability
best
dubbel
i
have
had
hands
down
best
scent
and
best
tasting
incredible
how
all
those
flavors
get
in
there
overall
a
nicely
done
dubbel
not
quite
as
complex
as
some
but
immensely
drinkable
with
a
fantastic
nose
i
enjoyed
it
more
the
second
time
around
when
i
tried
it
on
new
years
day
in
the
company
of
ba¬ís
rapapoda
watermelonman
and
his
girlfriend
stacy
nicely
done
the
smell
had
a
ton
of
banana
flavor
with
some
malt
sweetness
the
taste
followed
that
up
with
solid
malt
content
esters
and
a
light
hop
touch
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
nice
while
drinkability
is
very
high
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
barrel
aging
on
a
dubbel
not
a
combination
that
i
have
had
a
lot
of
times
i
chose
the
rum
barrel
aged
beer
on
this
cold
evening
because
rum
reminds
me
of
the
caribbean
and
i
needed
some
warm
thoughts
and
the
alcohol
warming
as
well
o
lots
of
dark
fruit
flavors
mix
well
with
the
barrel
aging
i
nice
slow
sipper
that
opens
up
as
it
warms
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
very
nice
balance
the
flavor
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
they
kept
in
check
a
beer
that
could
get
crazy
sweet
and
boozy
o
the
dubbel
is
not
a
style
i
often
go
for
but
i
have
so
enjoyed
all
of
heavy
seas
uncharted
waters
release
in
2013
and
2014
that
i
picked
this
up
these
guys
are
doing
some
real
nice
work
with
barrelaging
and
this
was
an
enjoyable
ale
may
be
hitormiss
for
hardcore
dubbel
fans
but
for
the
curious
openminded
ba
a
nice
ale
for
sure
overall
if
i
wanted
to
taste
brandy
i
would
go
out
and
buy
a
bottle
the
booze
really
takes
over
on
this
one
i
would
probably
not
suggest
this
one
to
a
friend
worth
trying
this
is
a
very
good
barrelaged
beer
from
heavy
seas
i
really
like
it
they
used
the
brandy
barrels
appropriately
this
might
not
be
a
mind
blower
but
its
close
i
probably
couldve
given
this
an
even
higher
score
its
just
very
enjoyable
and
well
crafted

a
great
beer
definitely
worth
keeping
an
eye
out
for
o
the
base
beer
is
a
classic
example
of
an
americanbrewed
belgian
beer
thats
clearly
americanbrewed
though
certainly
isnt
bad
unfortunately
this
beer
seems
to
have
spent
very
little
time
in
the
barrel
probably
a
continuously
used
barrel
at
that
as
it
tastes
young
it
hasnt
been
given
the
chance
to
really
mingle
with
the
brandy
which
is
more
of
an
after
thought
overall
i
am
not
sure
how
the
base
beer
is
since
i
never
had
holy
sheet
but
it
seems
pretty
good
with
brandy
notes
not
bad
overall
overall
very
nice
beer
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
ill
look
for
more
o
i
have
a
hard
time
aging
something
once
it
hits
my
fridge
or
household
vicinity
this
one
is
in
line
with
my
previous
belgian
abbey
ale
experiences
and
damned
if
i
am
not
curious
what
this
one
would
taste
like
with
another
year
under
its
belt
as
of
now
a
decent
offering
worth
trying
especially
if
you
are
into
the
style
3
75
d
very
good
barrel
effort
here
barrel
flavors
complement
the
base
beers
flavors
quite
well
o
a
nice
twist
to
a
dubbel
brandy
is
tasty
i
will
pick
this
up
again
seems
like
it
will
be
nice
on
a
cold
winter
day
the
feel
doesnt
translate
as
well
in
this
beer
its
smooth
yes
but
really
seems
to
run
thin
theres
not
much
crispness
to
liven
it
not
that
i
want
more
than
just
a
little
it
simply
seems
like
the
brandy
got
to
the
body
and
brought
it
down
some
for
a
heavy
style
meant
to
be
a
meal
the
body
ought
to
be
there
still
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
barrelaged
belgian
the
brandy
notes
blending
perfectly
with
the
belgian
notes
and
setting
a
high
standard
for
others
to
follow
the
brandy
barrels
are
inspired
here
as
too
often
belgians
are
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
which
can
lend
far
too
harsh
of
an
alcoholic
kick
there
is
perhaps
an
overabundance
of
sugar
and
sweetness
as
a
result
and
licking
your
lips
can
seem
like
licking
brandysoaked
brown
sugar
pops
but
the
beer
is
nice
enough
that
this
isnt
much
of
a
problem
overall
a
bold
beer
definitely
not
shy
with
the
alcohol
and
big
flavors
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
choice
to
set
aside
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
to
see
what
happens
in
any
case
if
you
happen
to
be
an
afficiandao
of
mild
belgians
i
most
heartily
recommend
this
beauty
it
is
not
complex
it
will
not
overwhelm
but
it
is
most
assuredly
a
very
nice
expression
from
hugh
sisson
and
his
motley
crew
gotta
keep
that
pirate
motif
going
dontcha
know
to
the
point
overall
this
is
great
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
the
aftertaste
is
long
this
is
a
great
sipper
that
is
truly
tasty
and
super
smooth
be
careful
of
the
9
nice
dark
red
hue
that
was
very
cloudy
couldnt
see
light
through
the
glass
the
scent
of
vanilla
overpowered
most
of
the
other
smells
the
taste
had
hints
of
toffee
vanilla
with
a
brandy
undertone
that
seemingly
got
stronger
as
i
drank
but
never
became
overbearing
was
a
medium
bodied
beer
and
overall
this
beer
is
quite
good
and
worth
trying
o
interesting
beer
and
glad
that
i
tried
it
at
least
once
pretty
good
deal
for
its
price
nine
dollars

theres

added

also
as

some
tannic
notes
are
revealed
as
well
as
a
coldbrewed

character
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in

but
closer
to
light
with
a
mild
even
carbonation
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
dubbel
great
complexity
and
flavor
and
i
almost
get
a
cotton
candy
character
in
the
flavor
profile
truly
top
notch
i
cant
fault
this
beer
to
style
i
tend
to
like
my
belgian
strongs
a
bit
drier
but
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
worth
a
try
i
have
to
be
honest
i
do
not
particularly
like
this
beer
it
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
far
from
something
i
would
buy
again
especially
at
the
price
this
beer
goes
for
about
6
a
bottle
the
bottle
gushed
when
opened
it
wasnt
shaken
or
disturbed
prior
to
opening
but
got
most
of
the
bottle
poured
into
the
glass
the
overall
lasting
impression
was
of
the
boozy
burn
and
phenolic
character
some
decent
caramel
malt
flavor
and
feel
were
evident
along
with
a
ripe
fruit
tone
but
ultimately
the
beer
seemed
a
bit
out
of
balance
and
thin
in
the
depth
department
not
bad
but
hardly
stunning
overall
not
a
bad
bruin
i
would
appreciate
a
little
more
sweetness
but
it
does
the
trick
for
what
i
wanted
today
okay
beer
a
bit
more
on
the
malty
side
rather
than
yeasty
bread
small
sting
of
alcohol
in
it
not
thick
and
syrupy
not
my
favourite
trappist
medium
full
body
with
above
average
carbonation
warming
a
solid
belgian
dubbel
with
malt
dark
fruit
and
caramel
flavors
dominating
those
monks
are
doing
it
right
2nd
edit
and
the
title
of
best
trappist
has
fallen
to
rochefort
8
still
dont
let
that
dissuade
you
from
this
one
final
grade
4

a
superb
a
while
dubbels
are
probably
my
least
favourite
of
the
various
trappist
styles
achel
8
bruin
is
one
example
that
i
am
finding
very
easy
to
enjoy
wellbalanced
with
barely
a
peep
from
the
alcohol
content
this
is
the
sort
of
brew
that
comes
highly
recommended
to
any
and
all
belgian
beer
enthusiasts
is
it
the
finest
trappist
beer
in
the
world
probably
not
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
wont
be
seeking
out
more
of
this
at
some
point
hopefully
to
cellar
adam
from
tipped
mixology
o
gotta
be
one
of
the
best
trappist
ales
ive
had
looks
flavor
just
damn
refined
and
fantastic
o
my
wife
and
i
both
enjoyed
this
beer
its
been
in
our
fridge
since
2011
and
we
decided
to
finally
try
it
on
this
beautiful
spring
day
perfect
overal
a
very
good
dubbeldark
ale
really
excellent
beer
here
the
boozey
and
yeasty
character
are
there
but
behind
the
wonderfully
complex
fruityspice
character
very
rich
and
interesting
little
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
a
solid
interpretation
lively
and
complex
at
the
same
time
with
a
really
nice
and
pleasing
character
paired
very
nicely
with
a
rich
aged
cheddar
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
that
almost
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
cross
between
a
strong
dark
ale
and
a
dubbel
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
and
im
likely
to
try
this
one
again
while
its
in
stores
i
am
a
fan
of
belgian
dubbels
westmalle
has
always
been
my
favorite
and
has
been
the
standard
by
which
i
measure
dubbels
well
this
is
damn
close
a
fine
dubbel
that
would
stand
with
any
get

you
can

a

quite
a

is

raisins
not
too
sweet
though
the
aftertaste
is
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
with
some

and
coffee
in
it
the
alcohol
doesnt
come

i
would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
great
experience
for
a
decent
price
cheers
overall
a
great
double
it
is
to
me
a
typically
dark
trappiste
westmalle
dubbel
and
rochefort
beers
are
really
similar
in
aromas
overall
not
too
bad
im
glad
i
tried
it
the
flavor
is
a
bit
has
a
bit
too
much
dark
grain
bitterness
but
otherwise
a
good
beer
a
very
well
made
trappist
dubbel
complex
and
very
easy
drinking
overall
another
delightful
dubbel
oi
am
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
like
my
dubbels
on
the
sweeter
side
and
this
brew
delivers
that
sweetness
i
enjoy
but
it
also
provides
just
enough
balance
in
the
finish
to
keep
things
interesting
and
prevent
that
syrupycloying
feeling
i
also
think
the
feel
is
close
to
perfect
and
the
alcohol
while
noticeable
in
the
smell
is
concealed
well
on
the
palate
o
a
great
example
of
belgian
trappist
with
a
quite
complex
flavor
and
still
a
smooth
beer
despite
its
80
abv
which
can
make
this
a
tasteful
trap
if
you
drink
too
much
great
beer
d
lacks
a
little
complexity
compared
to
other
top
notch
dubbels
but
still
very
tasty
overall
i
would
pick
other
trappist
beers
first
but
for
2
99
this
is
a
weekly
buy
amazing
trappist
taste
and
craftsmanship
for
a
great
price
and
my
bottle
says
8
abv
however
it
has
also
the
bready
dark
fruity
notes
of
other
trappist
most
similar
to
a
westmalle
dubbel
or
rochefort
6
or
even
an
8
for
the
price
you
cant
beat
it
and
that
head
is
still
there
as
its
blond
sister
it
is
a
trappist
with
high
drinkability
not
overly
sweet
and
still
rich
in
flavor
overall
a
great
trappist
that
tastes
even
better
after
2year
storage
smooth
smokey
taste
and
a
nice
warm
feeling
afterwards
overall
a
very
nice
dubbel
that
it
became
even
better
when
it
warmed
up
a
bit
nice
warming
feeling
from
the
alcohol
which
is
not
that
notable
on
the
taste
maybe
its
because
its
been
cellered
for
2
years
but
this
is
definately
a
well
put
together
dubbel
overall
a
bit
less
sweet
than
i
expected
more
bitter
and
complext
notes
of
very
different
kinds
of
fruits
really
good
beer
with
a
unique
character
really
enjoying
this
one
o
quite
good
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
get
the
chance
i
might
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
im
glad
i
have
a
couple

for
the
bottle
but
totally
worth
it
to
try
try
pairing
this
with
mussels
in
a
red
sauce
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
thoroughly
recommend
finding
a
bottle
of
this
do
definitely
repeatable
in
fact
i
would
enjoy
having
another
one
consecutively
but
it
likely
would
not
be
my
first
choice
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
flavors
and
aroma
really
continue
to
improve
as
the
beer
warms
and
it
was
pretty
darn
good
just
after
the
pour
high
b
overall
a
wonderfully
complex
and
very
drinkable
beer
each
sip
is
interesting
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
scent
is
really
the
highlight
for
me
another
beer
that
falls
into
the
must
try
category
dthis
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
its
a
little
sugary
with
all
the
dark
candied
fruits
and
lacks
complexity
but
still
a
tasty
brew
and
nice
lively
feel
overall
good
a
pretty
traditional
version
of
a
belgian
dubbel
but
maybe
not
a
standout
i
have
yet
to
try
a
belgium
beer
that
i
do
not
like
this
dubbel
from
brouwerij
der
st
benedictusabdij
de
achelse
has
nice
color
with
a
fragrant
nose
of
green
apples
and
figs
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
by
the
brews
exquisite
taste
and
body
two
thumbs
up
for
trappist
achel
8
bruin
its
all
very
light
but
still
staining
carbonation
is
little
aggressive
but
not
offensive
better
paired
with
food
than
other
dubbels
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
dubbel
copper

some

this

very

incredibly

certainly
something
i
would
come
back
for
o
another
great
trappist
beer
drinkability
overall
a
very
good
beer
went
great
with
quiche
lorraine
but
i
could
easily
have
another
all
by
itself
great
looking
beer
with
great
mouthfeel
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
beer
with
this
good
of
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
in
quite
awhile
only
weak
in
the
aroma
department
but
with
the
other
great
aspects
i
think
its
still
fair
to
say
that
this
is
a
great
beer
o
one
of
me
favorite
dubbles
not
the
easiest
to
find
but
worth
the
search
o
overall
a
very
solid
trappist
dubbel
fullbodied
sweet
and
with
just
enough
other
elements
in
this
case
fruit
to
make
it
interesting
very
well
done
as
is
to
be
expected
overall
given
that
this
is
a
dubbel
i
am
very
impressed
with
how
many
taste
notes
are
present
in
this
brew
bordering
on
a
quad
at
times
this
is
somewhat
stunning
considering
i
believe
their
blonde
to
be
rather
dull
this
is
a
180
for
me
personally
nice
dark
sweet
and
chewy
flavors
really
bring
this
beer
to
life
an
excellent
dubbel
o
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
a
dubbel
didnt
have
the
maryjane
candy
flavor
that
most
others
have
on
my
palatte
seems
like
a
blend
of
an
oud
bruin
and
dubbel
and
it
works
once
the
super
carbed
head
dies
down
this
is
fairly
enjoyable
fantastic
fantastic
fantastic
it
all
i
can
say
this
trappist
was
not
quite
as
dark
as
its
belgian
trappist
counterparts
however
dont
judge
by
that
it
is
a
sweet
extremely
smooth
and
delicate
beer
it
gets
better
as
is
warms
and
is
a
beer
best
drank
after
a
meal
when
you
can
just
relax
with
it
the
head
was
not
anything
to
particularly
write
home
about
i
do
own
a
goblet
glass
for
these
specialties
however
the
caramelcoffee
smell
was
very
savory
and
hard
to
put
down
after
a
drink
it
is
a
strong
beer
but
the
sweetness
of
it
masks
the
alcohol
content
nicely
personally
i
think
it
is
the
best
out
of
the
trappist
breweries
and
is
not
overly
expensive
o
simply
put
this
is
perhaps
the
best
dubbel
i
have
ever
tasted
o
one
of
the
best
belgians
ive
ever
had
this
is
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
in
a
long
time
for
this
to
have
been
perfect
i
would
loved
to
have
seen
its
tart
fruity
qualities
amplified
and
the
chalky
finish
toned
down
a
notch
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
its
still
a
great
beer
not
sure
why
ive
never
had
this
one
before
as
its
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
here
for
some
time
now
price
is
right
and
ive
now
tried
something
from
all
the
trappist
brewers
theres
definitely
a
grapedark
fruit
taste
in
there
its
actually
very
fruity
but
not
overpowering
so
smooth
but
it
has
a
bitter
bit
lavender
the
most
unique
looking
head
and
a
very
nice
taste
o
great
authentic
dubbel
overall
a
very
enjoyable
dubbel
good
stuff
o
this
is
one
enjoyable
dubbel
the
smells
and
flavor
make
this
one
pretty
damn
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
complex
beer
with
great
dark
fruits
but
a
little
boozy
with
too
much
carbonation
for
mine
overall
though
pretty
good
big
spicy
chewy
malts
like
sunday
bakery
very
balanced
in
that
theres
an
impressive
amount
of
flavor
while
being
drinkable
yet
never
burning
or
heavy
kinda
really
what
a
dubbel
should
be
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
tremendously
it
is
a
bit
sweet
and
heavy
for
the
style
but
is
still
well
worth
a
go
excellent
trappist
if
you
have
friends
interested
into
trying
trappist
beers
this
would
be
a
good
start
this
beer
seems
to
me
an
excellent
representative
of
the
belgian
dubbel
it
sometimes
verges
on
being
too
sweet
but
never
quite
crosses
the
line
the
alcohol
at
8
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
silky
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable
though
the
sweetness
would
probably
keep
me
from
having
two
in
a
row
overall
an
excellent
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
authentic
dubbel
o
pretty
good
dubbel
alcohol
is
blended
and
masked
nicely
worth
the
taste
but
probably
nothing
i
would
search
our
for
again
overall
drinkability
this
beer
deserves
a
much
higher
score
but
unfortunately
the
bottle
im
using
to
base
the
rating
on
is
not
a
great
example
has
tons
of
negative
characters
that
wasnt
found
in
my
first
bottle
and
none
of
the
complexity
either
just
goes
to
show
you
ever
beer
deserves
a
second
chance
because
you
never
know
for
reference
the
first
one
i
rated
would
have
been
something
like
an
a
or
a
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
as
sweet
as
it
was
it
hit
me
right
in
the
face
malts
nuts
plums
the
sweetness
calmed
down
the
further
down
the
glass
too
harsh
tasting
and
bitter
to
be
an
easy
drinking
beer
o
a
very
good
double
rich
smooth
and
slightly
too
fizzyovercarbonated
awesome
aroma
and
flavors
a
delicate
decadent
sipper
overall
this
beer
is
great
in
a
lot
of
ways
but
i
feel
like
it
has
got
more
potential
than
it
is
showing
still
a
very
good
beer
and
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
dubbels
d
alcohol
is
tasted
and
felt
the
warmth
it
gives
is
comforting
and
nice
its
not
so
pronounced
as
to
be
a
nuisance
but
it
is
there
in
the
most
polite
way
possible
everything
else
about
this
beer
its
weight
its
aroma
and
flavor
is
just
remarkable
this
stuff
is
great
one
of
the
overlooked
trappist
ales
o
i
was
overall
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
its
very
much
in
the
trappist
tradition
of
quality
traditional
style
beer
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
taste
is
quite
nice
bready
with
a
dr
pepper
and
caramel
maltiness
dark
fruit
is
vague
at
best
lending
a
light
tart
undercurrent
yeast
is
prevalent
an
even
a
bit
spiced
mouthfeel
is
full
enough
for
a
dubbel
but
the
body
does
not
approach
fullon
quad
proportions
this
one
falls
in
between
a
dubbel
and
a
quad
in
terms
of
flavor
body
and
alcohol
presence
tastier
than
i
expected
this
is
certainly
worthy
of
the
trappist
designation
good
beer
a
simple
drinkable
dubbel
you
wont
find
any
surprises
in
this
bottle
overall
an
extraordinary
beer
and
easily
among
the
best
dubbels
ive
had
to
date
a
great
beer
that
has
the
dark
belgian
complexity
and
drinkability
if
not
to
a
slightly
lesser
degree
than
some
of
the
other
trappists
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
brown
color
the
head
is
big
and
foamy
the
lacing
is
pretty
good
along
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
earthy
sweet
and
had
just
a
touch
of
fruit
and
spice
on
the
nose
the
taste
had
most
of
the
same
elements
it
started
off
sweet
with
some
earth
in
the
middle
and
just
a
slight
touch
of
fruity
spice
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
but
im
still
partial
to
the
achel
extra
when
it
comes
to
these
trappists
the
ruby
tone
the
spicy
aroma
and
nearperfect
balance
mingle
to
create
easily
one
of
the
best
dubbles
ive
had
saving
ultimate
awards
for
later
as
i
have
a
westy
8
to
try
in
the
next
few
weeks
but
honestly
cant
imagine
a
better

i

good

without
depth
and
with
an
annoying
metallic
aftertaste
that
just
ruins
everything
a
bit
boring
on
the
palate
but
not
bad
it
lacks
a
bit
of
mouthfeel
for
a
dubbel
in
my
opinion
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
decent
beer
but
not
a
lot
more
than
that
drink
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
will
have
to
come
back
to
this
dubbel
very
tasty
and
well
crafted
o
meh
okay
drinkability
and
overall
impression
im
finding
this
one
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
than
i
thought
it
might
be
when
i
began
this
is
definitely
a
dubbel
to
drink
only
lightly
chilled
the
flavor
balance
is
different
than
i
recall
from
other
dubbels
but
is
quite
nice
one
way
to
describe
the
impression
it
leaves
is
that
it
is
austere
rather
than
lush
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
that
has
been
overshadowed
to
a
degree
by
other
trappist
dubbels
which
may
be
bigger
in
flavor
but
that
are
not
any
better
this
beer
is
worth
seeking
out
and
deserves
to
be
more
well
known
drinkability
nice
enough
but
no
wow
factor
would
choose
a
different
trappist
ale
over
this
one
but
if
it
was
the
only
one
available
i
might
try
it
the
bottle
label
is
very
poor
though
so
i
would
probably
pass
over
it
i
cant
help
wondering
if
this
bottle
was
a
bit
off
the
yeasty
notes
were
a
bit
offending
but
much
good
parts
around
there
palate
is
crisp
dark
and
fruity
clean
texture
with
clean
finish
tasty
and
higher
carbonation
than
other
trappists
d
not
really
a
session
beer
too
heavy
for
that
but
each
sip
leaves
you
wanting
more
quenching
too
d
pretty
high
considering
how
fast
i
polished
it
off
d
nicely
done
drinkable
and
enjoyable
however
kind
of
strong
so
be
carefull
not
too
fussed
about
this
as
a
dubbel
or
as
a
beer
ive
had
better
of
both
conclusion
a
good
head
is
of
major
importance
to
a
belgian
and
having
a
nice
head
like
this
is
just
great
also
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
balance
to
it
a
slightly
hazy
deerskin
brown
with
a
fine
persistent
white
head
fragrance
of
malt
and
fruity
yeast
like
an
orchard
in
the
late
summer
flavor
is
malty
leaning
toward
sweetness
with
more
yeast
character
suggesting
apple
pear
and
even
a
bit
of
grape
finishes
clean
thanks
to
an
appearances
by
the
hops
carbonation
and
ethanol
all
in
all
a
nice
brew
a
little
dear
in
price
for
what
it
is
lovely
brew
even
though
it
doesnt
have
the
brazen
and
intense
complexity
of
the
best
belgians
its
a
very
drinkable
and
very
classic
belgian
brew
a
reasonable
beer
underneath
the
apple
notes
and
easy
enough
to
drink
d
drinks
very
smoothly
seems
to
mellow
out
as
it
warms
and
the
more
you
drink
d
even
at
this
abv
nice
and
more
please
a
pretty
agreeable
dubbel
maybe
a
bit
sweet
up
front
but
hardly
a
runaway
sugar
or
booze
bomb
as
it
does
well
to
mask
the
8
abv
making
this
slide
down
oh
so
enjoyably
good
stuff
overall
d
drinking
the
achel
bruin
is
an
absolute
pleasure
it
may
not
be
the
best
dubbel
ever
made
but
it
is
one
of
the
bestmade
this
will
probably
become
my
goto
beer
for
introducing
people
to
the
style
fruity
lightly
spicy
incredibly
nice
part
of
my
rapture
may
be
the
result
of
being
slightly
beerstarved
of
late
but
nevertheless
i
highly
recommend
this
one
will
be
buying
again
and
again
easy

drink

this
style
i
can
throw
back
a
few
and
then
get
in
trouble
but
seemed
like
some
mildly
bittersweet
tannic
concoction
to
me
akin
to
a
lightly
sweetened
black
tea
unfortunately
theres
way
too
much
carbonation
seriously
ridiculous
cant
get
much
of
a
taste
because
of
it
light
to
medium
bodied
sweet
with
a
slightly
bitter

finishes

a
very

head
mild
aroma
with
some
malts
and
hints
of
sourness
a
tasty
beer
but
quite
mild
in
flavor
theres
some
light
sweet
malts
fruit
grape
apple
and
some
bitter
and
sour
undertones
as
well
particularly
towards
the
finish
into
the

with

easy

with
no
taste
of

pours
a

with

nice

spots
nose
brings
dark
sugars
with
a
tiny
amount
of
roast
as
well
as
spice
and
a
bit
of
booze
the
taste
is
raisins
dates
other
dark

as
well
as
caramelized
sugar
some
booze

with

quite

not
great
beer
o
im
beginning
to
suspect
8
abv
dubbels
arent
really
my
thing
prefer
a
good
strong
smooth
more
complex
sweet
quad
certainly
calls
for
more
but
could
not
drink
a
lot
d
this
is
a
really
nice
dubbel
it
is
fairly
easy
drinking
despite
its
high
abv
this
disappeared
quickly
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
if
i
can
find
it
again
complex
and
flavorful

i
can
see
how
this
ale
might
get
cloying
after
a
while
nice
mouthfeel
for
the
style
good
body
not
thin
these
beers
are
drinkable
but
too
me
really
only
in
the
fall
and
winter
months
d
a
very
good
dubbel
in
a
style
that
ive
seen
a
lot
of
mediocrity
in
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
as
much
as
the
blond
but
theres
a
lot
of
good
flavours
here
and
well
worth
a
pickup
jd
overall
its
really
an
exceptional
dubbel
great
aroma
and
flavor
even
after
having
my
first
westy
12
last
night
this
is
very
impressive
pours
a
ruby
brown
colour
with
huge
offwhite
head
with
a
careful
pour
the
cloud
of
head
hardly
dissipates
with
nice
lacing
smells
is
sweet
brown
sugar
dried
fruits
and
belgian
yeast
flavour
has
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
this
comes
together
very
nicely
and
may
be
the
best
dubbel
ive
ever
had
at
least
so
far
very
nice
carbonation
level
dthis
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
its
a
little
sugary
with
all
the
dark
candied
fruits
and
lacks
complexity
but
still
a
tasty
brew
and
nice
lively
feel
an
extraordinary
example
of
what
a
trappist
dubbel
is
all
about
d
this
is
a
great
beer
very
easy
to
drink
by
itself
or
with
food
in
fact
dangerously
easy
considering
the
8
abv
this
is
the
kind
of
belgian
beer
i
could
have
several
of
in
a
sitting
i
have
had
several
of
the
other
offerings
from
achel
but
this
is
the
best
ive
had
so
far
taste
follows
with
a
nicely
balanced
footprint
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
solid
and
without
the
defectsoverabundance
often
found
in
the
style
gets
better
with
a
bit
of
warming
bit
creamy
on
the
finish
given
the
carbonation
a
very
solid
beer
that
doesnt
overwhelm
with
either
excessive
fruitiness
or
sweetness
not
as
complex
as
a
few
of
the
style
but
very
nice
and
hides

the
color
is
a

gorgeous
the

the

i
am
a
huge
fan
of
belgians
that
are
nice
and
dry
this
is
an
excellent
trappist
ale
and
i
regret
not
trying
it
sooner
d
i
would
have
no
problem
having
one
of
these
from
time
to
time
but
there
are
better
dubbels
out
there
d
this
is
quite
simply
the
best
dubbel
ive
had
up
to
this
point
i
am
not
a
tremendous
fan
of
the
style
usually
especially
in
comparison
to
the
other
trappist
works
but
this
one
is
ridiculous
all
in
all
one
of
the
better
dubbels
for
me
d
really
scary
how
drinkable
this
is
a
little
sweet
and
carbonated
but
reminds
me
a
lot
of
la
chouffe
nice
and
their
brune
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
can
drink
a
750
without
even
thinking
about
it
more
i
think
about
it
does
remind
me
a
lot
of
carbonated
grape
soda
yum
d
a
nice
example
of
the
style
some
good
complexity
with
malt
domination
without
overpowering
the
semi
dry
finish
strong
alcohol
and
darker
malt
flavor
on
the
initial
sip
theres
a
bitterness
present
from
light
hop
overall
this
is
a
sweet
offering
the
aftertaste
is
short
lived
for
the
style
good
blend
on
the
swallow
of
sweetbitterness
rich
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
warm
alcohol
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
though
i
felt
that
the
flavours
could
have
been
more
panoramic
the
malts
more
assertive
and
toasty
anyway
its
definitely
there
with
some
of
the
great
dubbels
out
there
d
very
drinkable
due
to
the
wellbalanced
nature
and
also
sweet
fruity
goodness
in
the
taste
well
disguised
alcohol
content
definitely
adds
a
good
bonus
here
4

the
drinkability
is
average
there
are
lots
of
flavors
going
on
but
everything
is
kept
in
check
the
clove
could
be
a
bit
much
at
times
though
a
very
good
dubbel
d
top
marks
again
for
this
very
solid
bruin
this
is
so
incredibly
well
balanced
and
makes
it
very
complex
the
least
of
the
trappists
maybe
but
its
still
a
nice
tasty
dubbel
glad
i
tried
it
i
think
this
is
the
first
authentic
belgian
beer
i
have
rated
on
this
site
so
i
dont
have
a
huge
frame
of
reference
but
all
in
all
i
liked
the
beer
and
i
would
try
other
varieties
in
the
future
if
given
the
opportunity
o
an
very
good
belgian
brown
i
am
looking
forward
to
another
if
i
can
find
it
our
local
shop
stopped
carrying
it
definitely
recommend
it
is
warming
and
easy
drinkable
it
does
seem
like
a
seasonal
beer
though
good
on
colder
rainy
days
notes
a
nice
beer
and
good
example
of
a
dubbel
a
touch
thin
and
doesnt
have
that
much
in
complexity
of
flavor
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
not
amazing
although
it
does
look
very
nice
but
a
solid
beer
you
could
probably
find
dubbels
with
a
better
value
and
it
isnt
my
favorite
trappist
beer
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
d
overall
a
wellmade
beer
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
other
trappist
offerings
i
know
that
brewing
isnt
their
main
objective
but
a
little
time
in
the
brewhouse
instead
of
the
chapel
might
help
them
out
d
its
very
easy
to
drink
particularly
as
it
warms
up
any
traces
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
are
very
well
masked
d
very
good
especially
at
8
abv
overall
i
didnt
think
this
aged
all
that
well
ill
have
to
have
it
fresh
to
be
sure
but
it
seemed
to
be
only
a
milder
version
of
what
it
once
was
overall
a
decent
beer
but
doesnt
match
the
standards
of
other
trappist
ales
i
have
tried
there
is
alot
of
yeast
in
the
aroma
and
tastemore
than
i
like
for
a
belgian
ale
and
the
body
is
rather
light
worth
trying
but
nothing
exceptional
this
is
a
hugely
drinkable
beer
one
that
gives
the
palate
a
ride
with
each
sip
it
is
one
that
i
am
resigned
to
keep
in
my
cellar
drinkability
sipping
this
beer
was
rather
enjoyable
due
to
the
great
mouthfeel
i
really
just
wasnt
impressed
due
to
how
light
the
flavors
and
aroma
was
in
the
beer
dvery
drinkable
at
8
and
is
very

and
would
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
for

the

just
not
my
style
of
beer
d
good
drinkability
and
solid
for
style
a
pleasant
surprise
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
delicious
and
was
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
my
familys
easter
dinner
its
got
great
toasted
malt
dried
stone
fruit
spice
funk
and
hops
flavors
in
a
great
balance
that
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
recommended
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
it
came
in
a
can
which
is
great
to
reduce
light
absorption
the
beer
was
extremely
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
and
had
a
nice
finish
great
beer
from
a
great
local
brewery
a
little
thick
sticky
on
the
finish
overall
a
dubbel
done
very
well
oi
remembered
having
this
years
ago
and
how
great
it
was
and
now
with
how
much
other
great
beer
has
improve
my
taste
o
a
tasty
dubbel
if
i
had
another
can
id
drink
it
o
okay
for
the
style
od
a
decent
dubbel
complex
and
hits
the
requisite
flavour
notes
but
doesnt
go
to
crazy
nice
o
one
of
the
more
wellmade
domestic
dubbels
ive
had
the
flavor
has
an
element
of
fruit
with
semispicy
yeast
giving
the
ale
more
of
a
light
taste
with
toasted
grain
taste
in
the
background
the
flavor
has
fruity
yeast
with
an
herbal
tinge
of
hops
perhaps
but
the
malt
is
lacking
in
this
for
my
taste
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
if
you
want
a
dubbel
more
representative
of
the
style
there
are
better
options
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
poured

an
above

overall
a
slightly

maybe
headed
towards

more
so
than
dubbel
sweetness
and
yeastiness
d
besides
the
slight
metallic
notes
this
is
a
pretty
good
dubbel
good
sweetness
fruitiness
not
too
shabby
o
an
enjoyable
dubbel
and
a
good
effort
on
an
american
attempt
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
solid
american
take
on
a
belgian
dubbel
it
grew
on
me
a
bit
as
i
drank
it
but
it
never
wowed
me
it
seemed
a
bit
scattered
compared
to
some
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
but
it
was
still
enjoyable
o
really
a
great
beer
from
this
brewery
and
now
i
really
want
to
try
more
of
their
beers
overall
i
guess
i
had
high
expect
ions
coming
into
this
beer
it
was
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
for
this
style
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
out
of
this
world
when
it
comes
to
my
beer
palate
it
did
have
a
smooth
creamy
body
that
went
down
nice
and
hid
the
alcohol
well
i
would
try
again
only
if
it
were
on
tap
since
i
would
love
to
have
another
experience
from
a
different
side
i
would
recommend
to
a
friend
who
isnt
familiar
with
the
genre
but
looking
to
expand
i
would
recommend
at
least
a
bottle
cheers
overall
i
was
shocked
at
how
well
crafted
this
beer
was
made
and
its
taste
its
absolutely
worth
trying
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
many
times
to
come
overall
a
pretty
nice
dry
and
warming
dubbel
which
all
the
while
still
maintains
a
nice
fruit
flavor
profile
although
it
is
a
bit
on
the
boozy
and
biting
side
at
the
end
of
the
taste
it
is
still
rather
enjoyable
to
drink
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
opportunity
all
in
all
a
maryland
brew
to
be
proud
of
o
classifying
this
beer
as
a
double
doesnt
do
it
justice
its
unquestionably
offstyle
for
a
double
but
its
unquestionably
delicious
id
be
much
happier
calling
it
an
american
double
a
lighter
hoppier
version
of
its
belgian
cousin
and
to
that
end
id
argue
that
it
was
brewed
perfectly
tostyle
lol
no
matter
how
you
label
it
though
its
a
fantastic
brew
this
one
took
me
totally
by
surprise
and
i
was
quite
happily
blown
away
its
just
an
okay
beer
really
doesnt
taste
contrived
after
letting
it
warm
up
and
become
fullyrealized
i
can
admit
that
its
right
in
the
ballpark
after
all
a
uniquely
dry
dubbel
and
out
of
a
can
no
less
notes
recommended
to
me
by
the
midatlantic

news
baltimore
correspondent
alexander
mitchell
while
we
were
waiting
in
line
on
20121212
for
the
special
release
of
westvletereen
xii
really
cool
to
see
a
belgian
beer
in
a
can
judgment
still
out
on
how
this
will
hold
up
with
belgian
beer
fans
appearance
had
a
cherry
red
raisin
color
with
a
slight
blood
orange
hue
clarity
was
minimal
a
big
off
white
head
that
dissipated
somewhat
quickly
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
full
of
dark
candi
sugar
sweetness
some
toffee
notes
some
dark
fruit
notes
def
cherry
with
a
slight
citrus
and
caramel
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
not
exactly
the
same
though
some
raisin
notes
perk
up
in
the
front
the
middle
seems
to
present
the
moderately
strong
dark
sugar
character
that
is
similar
in
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
i
feel
is
a
bit
in
the
middle
for
a
belgian
style
ale
it
could
either
finish
quicker
or
hang
out
but
transits
while
it
hangs
around
i
believe
this
to
be
a
sessionable
style
belgian
beer
with
a
higher
than
average
abv
its
aroma
really
did
it
for
me
and
the
interesting
coffee
acridness
which
i
am
probably
confusing
for
a
higher
than
average
hoppyness
combined
with
the
malt
character
is
actually
very
enjoyable
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
clear
dark
ruby
red
color
that
produced
a
nice
white
head
that
left
a
thin
cap
the
beer
gave
off
a
nice
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
yeast
and
sugar
the
beer
had
a
really
good
taste
to
it
i
have
to
admit
that
the
style
is
not
my
favorite
but
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
bunch
that
i
have
tried
sweet
maltiness
with
hints
of
sugar
a
hint
of
alcohol
is
ever
so
noticeable
the
beer
had
a
nice
moderate
feel
to
it
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
very
good
beer
with
no
let
down
from
the
one
that
i
tried
from
a
can
i
will
have
this
beer
again
the
next
time
that
i
am
in
baltimore
not
bad
with
many
traditional
dubbel
characteristics
just
not
as
pronounced
as
some
of
its
style
counterparts
d
everything
but
the
taste
of
this
dubbel
is
a
winner
it
is
just
too
bitter
d
a
bit
bland
for
a
dubbel
the
yeast
character
is
mild
and
the
malt
is
not
quite
as
dark
as
i
would
expect
it
to
be
for
the
style
just
not
much
going
on
here
overall
its
definitely
very
drinkable
its
just
not
very
flavorful
almost
like
a
watered
down
dubbel
however
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
i
wish
the
feel
had
been
a
little
smoother
because
the
aroma
and
taste
are
both
quite
nice
ressurection
comes
to
me
looking
pretty
standard
doubleish
with
a
dark
brown
bordering
on
red
kinda
like
a
maroon
color
with
a
cream
tan
shaded
head
that
sat
on
top
leaving
minor
ticks
on
the
glass
nice
looking
up
towards
the
light
smell
is
real
bready
a
deep
dark
bread
not
overly
yeasty
like
most
smells
of
caramel
and
plums
with
raisin
plus
others
a
very
good
dubble
here
better
than
most
american
versions
ive
had
recently
dark
fruits
plus
plums
with
dark
bread
some
faint
cherry
notes
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
some
banana
and
hefeweizen
tastes
feel
is
a
step
down
from
medium
and
is
a
tad
thin
but
that
makes
this
even
more
drinkable
i
finished
a
12oz
and
contemplated
getting
more
for
a
style
thats
not
my
priority
get
a
hold
of
this
stuff
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
decent
head
on
top
of
a
spicey
and
sweet
malt
def
some
sugar
aroma
complete
with
a
touch
of
yeast
and
orange
found
in
belgians
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
nor
does
it
have
pronounced
fruit
flavors
but
overall
there
is
a
good
citricorange
fruit
quality
with
a
sweet
vibe
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
easy
with
a
nice
little
kick
at
the
end
and
you
can
sorta
feel
the
booze
as
you
keep
sipping
a
pretty
good
ale
and
def
worth
a
try
if
your
in
the
baltimore
area
as
far
as
the
can
version
of
this
beer
goes
dont
fret
there
is
quality
inside
the
can
too
its
not
that
often
you
find
a
belgian
style
dubbel
in
a
can
so
credit
to
brewers
art
for
taking
a
chance
o
this
is
a
bad
beer
tastes
like
a
macrolager
with
a
bit
more
malt
never
again
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
had
it
on
tap
awhile
ago
and
this
was
just
as
good
from
the
bottle
if
not
better
overall
a
decent
enough
dubbel
but
perhaps
the
real
magic
is
putting
a
belgianstyle
ale
in
a
can
something
id
love
to
see
more
of
fairly
pleased
with
this
brew
have
tried
brew
of
similar
style
body
has
been
thin
or
taste
is
astringent
common
dubbel
flaws
this
one
is
slightly
over
carbonated
which
could
be
attributed
to
the
age
would
put
this
on
par
with
proper
belgian
dubbels
would
get
this
one
again
wanted
to
save
longer
but
glad
with
the
result
temp
50f
o
overall
who
woulda
thunk
it
a
dubble
from
a
can
i
love
canned
beer
but
this
is
a
style
that
it
seems
the
canning
hurts
it
would
love
to
try
this
from
tap
or
perhaps
a
bottle
to
see
if
the
canning
of
a
dubble
just
doesnt
work
as
i
suspect
pours
a
light
brown
with
mahoganyish
highlights
and
a

that
hangs
out

a

taste

the
nose
translating
in
balance
and
with
a
touch
of
mustiness
medium
body
with
lower
than
what
i
expected
carbonationwise
i
think
i
needed
more
umph
and
a
little
more
carbonation
to
carry
things
through
spice
and
must
in
the
finish
minimal

good
beer
from
one
of
the
forerunners

i
loved
the
pour
from
this
can
but
i
cant
say
the
same
for
the
beer
a
classic
middleoftheroad
dubbel
i
like
seeing
a
belgian
style
beer
in
a
can
though
one
of
the
few
beers
in
this
style
brewed
in
the
us
where
i
could
distinctly
pick
out
the
tasting
elements
brought
in
by
the
malts
hops
and
yeast
in
most
of
these
one
or
two
dominate
and
the
malts
or
the
hops
are
typically
relegated
to
mouthfeel
duty
without
bringing
any
additional
flavors

muted
and

buy
this

drinkability

i
wouldnt
really
call
this
a
true
dubbel
style
but
its
good
and
consistent
o
a
great
local
staple
and
recommended
for
any
beer
fan
o
i
think
i
enjoy
trading
just
because
i
get
the
opportunity
to
try
beers
like
this
if
im
ever
in
the
area
ill
be
drinking
several
more
of
these
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
drinkability
very
well
done
complex
and
complementary
elements
decent
yet
not

very
drinkable
o

my
favorite

of
home

me
a

snifter
it
pours
a

bodied
nice
reddish
copper
in
color
with
a

soapy
cream
colored
head
the
aromas
are
of
aluminum
pale
malt
and
caramel
malt
its
hard
for
me
to
get
much
because
of
the
aluminum
the
flavors
are
of
slight
aluminum
caramel
malts
mild
yeasty
spice
with
light
dark
fruits
again
the
aluminum
is
a
little
too
prominent
and
takes
away
from
the
actual
flavors
of
the
beer
this
beer
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
has
a
near
perfect
body
overall
this
seems
that
its
a
beer
that
should
not
be
canned
and
should
remain
in
the
bottle
id
be
interested
in
trying
this
one
from
the
tap
or
out
of
a
bottle
overall
a
very
good
beer
to
be
taken
slowly
and
with
consideration
one
of
my
friends
who
digs
this
beer
said
it
best
its
an
unbelgiany
belgian
ale
for
people
who
typically
dont
like
belgian
ales
im
having
trouble
fathoming
that
this
is
from
a
can
so
good
so
good
it
might
not
be
a
world
class
dubbel
but
its
a
damn
good
one
and
in
a
can
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
the
flavors
blend
together
well
its
also
fun
to
drink
belgian
beer
out
of
a
can
d
impressive
rather
quaffable
dangerously
so
given
the
7
0
abv
a
solid
all
around
american
interpretation
of
the
dubbel
style
and
in
a
can
to
boot
a
pleasant
surprise
and
welcome
introduction
to
the
brewers
art
mouth
lots
of
spices
meets
a
mild
almost
esb
like
hop
presence
not
overly
sweet
like
a
total
americanized
version
of
a
dubbel
some
cinnamon
baking
spices
but
dry
hoppy
finish
strong
coating
mouthfeel
actually
quite
a
nice
marriage
of
old
new
world
brewing
glad
i
went
for
the
6pack
big
thanks
goes
out
to
lunch
for
this
in
a
past
trade
served
from
can
into
an
orval
goblet
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
half
finger
khaki
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
subtle
alcohol
and
subtle
wheat
it
had
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
from
a
can
it
was
fairly
complex
and
refreshing
as
well
the
dark
fruits
were
definitely
the
star
of
the
show
on
this
one
this
one
is
definitely
worth
trying
for
sure
this
one
surprised
me
im
happy
i
have
another
on
tap
at
a
beer
tasting
event
in
md
poured
a
dark
cloudy
orange
caramel
color
with
a
tall
creamy
offwhite
head
there
was
a
sweet
malt
aroma
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
the
initial
taste
was
sweet
with
a
light
taste
of
alcohol
present
there
was
a
little
bit
of
a
spice
and
nutty
flavor
as
well
after
the
initial
taste
there
was
a
bit
of
a
dry
mettalic
taste
that
deleoped
into
a
bit
of
a
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
liked
that
this
wasnt
overly
sweet
the
hops
on
the
finish
blended
well
through
the
sweetness
leaving
a
nice
feel
on
the
palate
d
i
love
having
a
beer
this
good
brewed
this
close
by
d
another
comforting
beer
from
brewers
art
rich
and
lush
even
with
the
higher
booze
content
d
for
7
this
is
pretty
drinkable
very
good
stuff
im
interesting
in
trying
this
again
dont
know
about
this
one
thin
taste
thin
mouthfeel
definite
sugary
quality
to
the
point
that
i
wouldve
mistaken
it
for
a
macro
actually
the
closest
reference
point
i
have
for
this
is
the
st
pauli
dark
i
had
on
super
bowl
sunday
very
similar
in
taste
in
character
decent
enough
but
i
dont
think
id
rush
back
for
more
its
my
first
review
a
nice
easydrinking
belgian
and
from
a
can
no
less
not
really
what
i
would
think
of
as
a
dubbel
and
nothing
overly
unique
about
it
but
a
nice
solid
brew
d
all
good
until
close
to
the
swallow
this
literally
just
falls
apart
from
a
decent
beer
into
somewhat
of
a
mess
perhaps
the
can
has
something
to
do
with
this
what
do
i
know
d
ugh
even
the
taster
was
too
much
theres
no
way
i
could
drink
750ml
of
this
even
if
i
was
desperate
takes
the
intense
sweetness
of
a
barleywine
adds
more
types
of
sugar
and
balances
it
with
fruity
belgian
yeast
not
much
of
a
dubbel
a
very
big
thanks
goes
out
to
grownfool
for
sending
this
extra
which
was
on
my
wants
list
resurrection
pours
out
a
clear
rose
color
with
a
quick
to
fade
white
head
bready
malt
in
the
nose
followed
by
some
mild
stone
fruit
such
as
grape
strawberry
and
some
cream
in
the
finish
big
and
juicy
up
front
as
far
as
taste
goes
with
the
fruit
that
was
mentioned
above
toward
the
end
it
gets
much
dryer
with
a
graham
cracker
like
bite
and
more
full
of
esthers
and
yeast
body
is
medium
and
although
the
alcohol
can
be
tasted
it
does
not
take
anything
away
from
the
drinkability
this
is
my
first
beer
from
a
brewery
i
have
wanted
to
try
for
some
time
i
am
not
the
least
bit
disappointed
as
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
complex
dubbel
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
these
guys
cheers
d
medium
to
light
bodied
not
too
expensive
notes
while
nothing
particularly
outstanding
this
is
a
nice
and
reliable
ale
good
for
an
uncomplicated
malty
sweet
offering
with
some
dark
fruit
touches
d
this
was
pretty
good
i
didnt
have
incredibly
high
hopes
after
having
some
other
canned
belgian
style
beers
siamese
twin
and
monks
blood
but
this
one
exceeded
expectations
note
resurrection
is
one
of
only
two
canned
belgianstyle
dubbels
currently
available
in
the
us
the
other
is
siamese
twin
ale
by
uncommon
brewers
in
santa
cruz
california
d
a
very
enjoyable
american
version
of
a
dubbel
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
of
things
in
overall
impression
flavors
and
aromas
are
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
but
still
quite
good
not
going
to
rival
the
best
from
belgium
but
a
worthy
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
overall
the
nose
was
solid
and
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
good
however
the
taste
just
didnt
put
up
the
flavor
this
one
is
not
very
drinkable
and
something
i
will
struggle
to
finish
my
12
oz
can
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
grapy
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
twofinger
plus
foamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
thickcreamy
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slight
yeast
note
grapes
slight
cherries
with
some
spice
note
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
nice
little
touch
of
yeast
grapy
some
cherries
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
fine
brew
so
far
2
for
2
with
them
recommended
hv
basically
this
beer
is
middle
of
the
road
in
my
opinion
i
believe
that
there
are
many
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
and
id
like
to
have
this
again
hopefully
i
will
have
a
better
experience
the
next
time
around
the
crack
of
the
top
exposed
yet
another
craft
can
filled
to
near
the
brim
we
certainly
get
our
moneys
worth
from
the
micros
in
a
can
my
pour
netted
me
a
finger
of
rocky
medium
tan
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
rubyreddish
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
rich
with
spices
and
dried
fruits
it
smelled
like
a
holiday
fruitcake
cinnamon
nutmeg
lemon
zest
prunes
apples
all
overlaying
a
general
yeasty
mustiness
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
approaching
a
creaminess
on
the
tongue
jeez
but
this
was
dry
the
spices
were
what
really
came
through
on
the
tongue
and
then
translated
to
a
breathtakingly
dry
finish
the
fruity
esters
on
the
nose
really
got
lost
in
the
overall
flavor
which
is
too
bad
overall
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
would
not
be
something
that
i
would
want
as
a
steady
diet
nor
would
i
want
it
in
my
cooler
in
the
summertime
maybe
on
hula
in
the
coola
day
d
an
excellent
dubbel
that
comes
in
cans
for
11
a
six
pack
i
love
the
american
craft
beer
scene
today
the
u
s
is
the
the
beer
capital
of
the
world
no
question
drinkability
another
tasty
beer
from
brewers
art
ive
had
several
of
their
offerings
and
theyve
all
be
very
solid
this
one
is
no
exception
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
while
i
could
sit
down
pick
out
the
individual
flavors
this
just
lacked
a
definition
to
it
which
hurt
the
overall
complexity
of
the
profile
instead
this
just
came
off
as
a
warm
sticky
mess
at
times
and
failed
to
keep
me
interested
during
the
duration
of
the
glass
its
a
shame
as
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
seeing
at
how
this
is
the
second
belgoamerican
ale
to
get
released
in
cans
that
i
know
of
i
think
that
ill
stick
with
a
monks
blood
next
time
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
aspect
but
a
rather
non
stand
out
from
the
crowds
im
confused
by
this
beer
the
smell
seemed
to
fit
the
bill
for
a
dubbel
different
than
many
but
still
within
the
ballpark
but
the
taste
is
out
there
the
bitterness
is
overdone
and
overwhelms
what
sweetness
there
is
which
is
not
enough
to
begin
with
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
think
this
is
just
off
and
out
of
balance
its
decent
but
in
need
of
tweaking
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
spices
and
yeast
taste
is
good
yeast
spices
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
decent
brew
drinkability
fine
d
taste
was
good
from
the
start
and
kept
getting
more
complex
and
interesting
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
its
depth
d
a
pretty
nice
dubbel
lots
going
on
in
the
taste
but
i
really
liked
it
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
smell
and
taste
and
thought
the
smell
was
very
balanced
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
little
less
carbonated
would
try
again
dquite
good
and
drinkable
for
7
i
cant
really
taste
the
alcohol
too
much
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
having
it
local
in
baltimore
is
a
plus
overall
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
belgian
dubbel
that
is
full
in
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
another
fine
beer
form
brewers
art
recommended
oh
well
it
was
worth
a
try
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
drinkability
is
very
good
a
nice
dubbel
for
my
taste
with
enough
sweetness
to
counter
the
spicy
esters
full
of
character
yet
still
highly
digestible
very
well
done
ive
been
really
impressed
with
the
four
brewers
art
beers
ive
got
to
enjoy
so
far
thanks
again
john
not
a
bad
beed
by
any
stretch
however
it
just
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
from
people
who
have
described
it
as
the
best
beer
of
all
time
had
a
frothy
head
and
a
big
white
head
taste
was
intense
with
wheat
i
was
overwhelmed
by
how
much
wheat
was
in
there
it
had
also
a
mixed
taste
of
spices
was
a
bit
dryer
then
i
would
have
expected
it
was
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
have
minded
having
another
of
however
it
wasnt
the
best
beer
i
had
that
night
review
from
notes
taken
on
121809
this
is
my
first
beer
from
brewers
art
and
i
dont
mind
saying
that
i
am
impressed
id
like
more
please
so
drinkable
i
had
two
despite
100
other
choices
available
ill
have
more
on
my
next
trip
to
baltimore
pours
clear
copper
with
an
out
of
control
head
smell
is
fruity
and
phenolic
with
apricot
pear
quince
flavor
is
fruity
apricot
all
spice
apple
a
little
vanilla
with
nice
bitterness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
slightly
clingy
but
way
overcarbonated
as
it
warms
strong
brown
sugar
and
toffee
comes
through
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
its
very
easy
drinking
and
has
an
amazing
mouthfeel
it
definitely
doesnt
have
the
intense
sort
of
big
flavor
that
most
dubbels
have
but
i
think
id
prefer
this
just
a
nice
beer
that
was
an
even
nicer
surprise
thanks
d
its
tasty
and
is
nice
to
drink
not
to
be
had
quickly
though
picked
up
a
bottle
at
state
line
liquors
in
md
for
about
10
this
is
a
dubbel
ok
the
brewers
art
website
calls
it
an
abbey
ale
i
can
live
with
that
the
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
the
flavor
falls
a
little
flat
for
my
liking
and
the
malts
remind
me
of
stale
bread
there
is
a
very
pleasant
dry
bitter
finish
that
bring
this
beer
back
from
the
edge
of
mediocrity
which
really
isnt
too
bad
in
this
style
its
very
drinkable
and
the
body
is
right
on
for
the
style
d
can
drink
these
all
night
but
beware
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
an
amber
color
small
head
it
smells
sweet
and
thick
like
molasses
upon
taking
a
sip
it
tastes
like
quality
tobacco
leaves
some
sugar
and
barley
too
in
the
mouthfeel
in
addition
to
the
aforementioned
flavors
i
come
across
vanilla
beans
drinkability
is
good
on
this
local
maryland
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
soft
not
quite
fluffy
a
bit
sticky
good
but
not
great
interesting
brew
had
travelling
in
baltimore
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
and
some
decent
lacework
on
the
glass
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
but
detected
a
little
fruitiness
but
then
i
have
a
weak
nose
the
taste
with
also
a
bit
fruity
with
a
cherry
like
tartness
a
little
clove
zip
and
a
little
yeastiness
finished
with
a
warm
resiny
hops
realy
enjoyable
progression
of
flavors
as
you
drink
has
some
complixity
but
very
drinkable
and
comes
across
almost
like
a
session
beer
for
the
dubbel
style
d
enjoyable
delicious
nostalgic
edit

had
another
bottle
of
this
also
thanks
to
my
brotherinlaw
this
past
weekend
bumped
down
the
mouthfeel
score
as
it
was
overlycarbonated
gentle
pours
still
resulted
in
geysers
and
it
had
an
impact
on
the
drinking
experience
otherwise
still
a
decent
effort
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
stays
for
a
while
smells
of
sweet
belgian
spices
just
as
any
other
belgian
ale
would
tastes
good
ive
had
this
beer
many
other
times
before
it
has
a
typical
dubbel
taste
nothing
too
special
sweet
citrus
hops
smooth
alcohol
flavor
and
good
maltyness
mouthfeel
was
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
the
same
went
down
well
d
this
was
the
second
bottle
that
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
i
must
say
they
do
a
very
good
job
at
making
belgian
style
beers
worth
trying
sometime
a
loads
of
carbonation
on
an
easy
pour
after
5
minutes
of
sitting
the
beer
is
still
settling
and
with
a
solid
centimeter
of
thick
foam
that
climbs
the
edge
of
the
glass
lots
of
fine
sediment
the
color
of
a
opaque
iced
tea

s
significant

d
im
happy
i
have
750
ml
and
not
12
ounces
nuff
said
d
excellent
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
in
the
baltimore
area
consider
this
their
goto
beer
pours
a
cloudy
deep
burgundy
and
amber
color
with
a
solid
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
aromas
of
pepper
and
clove
sweet
caramel
covered
pears
and
light
spicy
phenols
on
the
palate
this
one
continues
to
be
quite
spicy
with
a
moderately
large
body
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
creamy
and
smooth
contributing
to
a
high
drinkability
not
nearly
as
good
as
le
canard
but
still
a
really
nice
belgian
from
a
brewery
american
even
that
does
a
damn
good
job
of
making
belgian
beers
rerate
on
tap
at
brewers
art
bumped
up
the
numbers
a
little
bit
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
better
the
second
time
around
drinkability
a
really
solid
and
tasty
is
strange
dubbel
which
seemed
very
dubbelesque
at
times
and
not
so
much
at
others
and
it
definitely
took
a
while
to
get
used
to
when
id
grown
acclimatized
to
it
however
it
came
across
really
well
alcohol
is
reasonable
perhaps
even
a
little
low
for
the
style
and
wellhidden
and
everything
is
else
is
perfectly
pleasant
i
could
drink
this
all
day
its
a
pretty
good
beer
though
the
alcohol
might
be
a
little
to
high
for
that
i
dont
want
it
to
sound
like
its
too
sweet
but
it
is
quite
sweet
if
that
makes
sense
visited
the
brewpub
after
a
week
in
columbia
d
a
really
interesting
belgian
mongrel
with
a
lot
of
dry
flavors
pours
a
clear
amber
flavor
is
whoa
not
exactly
working
for
me
too
much
bite
and
too
much
acid
it
says
loads
of
sugar
have
been
used
in
this
one
but
i
cant
tell
at
all
feel
has
a
full
carbonation
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
too
leafy
earthy
unbalanced
and
lacking
character
its
a
decent
belgian
style
but
i
just
dont
dig
it
enjoyed
on
tap
at
mahaffeys
in
baltimore
thick
layers
of
lace
on
cloudy
amber
yeasty
aroma
including
some
funkiness
some
sourness
some
hops
balanced
not
too
sweet
alcohol
detected
of
palate
interesting
though
there
are
many
very
good
examples
of
the
style
d
a
very
enjoyable
dubbel
there
are
some
alcohol
flavors
there
that
remind
you
of
the
strength
but
the
flavor
profile
is
very
interesting
drinkabilityhides
its
high
alcohol
content
well
i
could
easily
drink
too
many
of
these
at
a
sitting
the
alcohol
hit
is
heavy
as
a
percentage
of
the
beer
but
its
completely
hidden
in
the
brew
so
take
it
easy
when
drinking
these
to
sum
it
up
brewers
art
resurrection
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
that
is
deceptive
to
the
palate
but
does
pull
a
strong
punch
while
this
is
a
fine
beer
from
an
imaginative
brewer
had
i
had
it
at
maxs
it
would
have
been
easily
overwhelmed
by
a
good
majority
of
the
many
fine
belgians
i
enjoyed
during
the
72
hours
of
belgium
i
recommend
an
occasional
stir
just
to
keep
the
flavor
alive
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
was
suprosed
with
the
alcohol
content
and
that
this
was
a
dubbel
it
seemed
like
more
of
a
brown
ale
with
stronger
fruit
and
malt
very
pleasurable
to
drink
long
story
short
a
very
tasty
beer
id
love
to
try
again
preferably
at
the
brewers
art
samir
office
space
drinkability
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
i
love
the
finish
cant
wait
to
try
more
brewers
art
beers
at
the
10th
anniversary
dinner
tomorrow
d
pretty
good
the
bitterness
started
to
get
to
be
toward
the
end
of
the
brew
but
nothing
severe
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
but
i
feel
it
is
vastly
inferior
to
the
proletary
decently
drinkable
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
drinkability
very
enjoyable
and
for
me
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
simply
a
must
try
if
it
is
available
this
beer
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
gate
fast
almost
spinning
its
wheels
a
bit
frantically
really
but
it
got
itself
under
control
and
at
the
end
of
the
pint
i
realized
i
enjoyed
it
the
abv
never
came
through
at
any
point
that
i
noted
anyway
and
that
was
a
good
thing
considering
the
sometimes
herkyjerky
flavor
ride
and
while
i
did
move
on
to
something
different
id
have
had
no
qualms
about
having
a
nother
of
these
because
the
end
result
is
tasty
it
might
have
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
but
its
enough
to
me
to
look
this
way
again
drinkable
is
that
even
a
question
here
highly
drinkable
should
have
ordered
this
first
best
of
the
three
i
tried
at
brewers
art
easy
going
down
tatse
was
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
and
the
aromas
come
through
in
the
taste
its
medium
bodied
smooth
and
finishes
sticky
sweet
in
the
mouth
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
a
dark
orangish
brown
with
a
big
lasting
beige
head
and
good
lacing
smell
is
plums
raisins
tofee
and
chocolate
the
same
flavors
come
through
in
the
taste
with
the
dark
fruits
dominating
and
a
nice
hops
taste
coming
through
on
the
end
full
bodied
and
creamy
this
is
an
easy
drinker
this
is
another
great
belgian
ale
from
the
brewers
art
and
theres
good
reason
its
their
most
widely
available
offering
browned
tarnished
copper
penny
in
color
with
a
half
inch
or
so
of
a
bubbly
semidense
head
alcohol
soaked
fruits
raisins
plum
skin
prunes
some
cocoa
and
some
nuts
fill
the
nose
some
nice
spiciness
as
well
similarly
fruity
flavor
with
a
sprinkling
of
cinnamon
or
allspice
and
a
more
solid
caramel
taste
a
bit
dry
and
maybe
woody
theres
some
clove
to
this
as
well
a
very
nice
rendition
still
very
drinkable
and
7
allows
for
more
than
one
glass
drinkability
is
really
good
really
nice
mixture
of
malts
spices
and
bitterness
well
made
beer
i
reviewed
the
regular
version
of
this
on
tap
previously
this
was
better
on
two
counts
first
the
blackberry
added
a
nice
tang
and
brought
the
color
level
from
brownish
to
a
nicer
garnet
secondly
as
cask
conditioned
the
mouthfeel
was
especially
pleasing
with
the
bubbles
softer
and
fewer
on
tap
poured
a
solid
dark
brown
medium
bubble
head
of
about
12
inch
and
left
some
basic
lacing
malty
nutty
nose
malty
brew
medium
bodied
and
average
carbonation
not
sure
why
this
is
characterized
as
a
dubbel
what
i
tasted
was
more
of
a
brown
ale
with
the
slightest
touch
of
belgian
spicing
in
any
event
this
is
a
pleasant
brown
brew
smooth
and
tasty
i
paired
this
up
with
an
appetizer
of
four
hour
port
wine
and
charm
city
sour
cherry
ale
braised
pork
belly
toasted
garlic
chips
poached
shallot
i
suppose
the
sour
cherry
ale
would
have
been
the
more
appropriate
choice
but
i
am
hardly
ever
appropriate
dark
amber
color
frothy
off
white
head
with
lasting
creamy
lace
slight
sweet
malt
nose
very
slight
small
bitterness
upfront
followed
by
sweet
caramel
malt
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
over
whelmes
a
little
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
slight
abv
sting
soft
finish
good
but
missing
a
little
something
i
must
say
on
1st
try
opf
this
beer
i
really
cant
detect
the
abv
presence
i
mean
w
something
like
7
i
would
expect
a
hint
of
something
but
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
my
nonba
loving
friends
really
got
into
this
stuff
so
when
we
went
out
we
had
some
not
much
hed
retention
and
almost
no
lace
dark
amber
hue
hints
of
indecernable
fruit
prescence
strong
malt
prescece
and
some
nice
hops
for
a
finish
smooth
and
clean
nice
crisp
beer
that
is
extrememly
drinkable
and
should
be
had
by
all
one
of
the
best
us
brewed
belgians
ive
had
they
bill
it
as
a
dubbel
but
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
dark
strong
ale
ive
had
this
both
at
the
brewery
and
from
my
own
tap
setup
here
at
home
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
frothy
silky
head
a
lot
of
malt
and
fruit
flavors
with
a
nice
sweetness
some
hints
of
rasins
too
well
balanced
for
its
abv
and
has
a
nice
crisp
finish
with
no
lingering
alcohol
taste
overall
a
very
solid
offering
from
this
excellent
brewery
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
goldhazelnut
color
that
was
visually
cloudy
that
when
held
to
the
light
you
see
red
and
orange
hues
through
out
it
produced
a
beigelemon
color
that
was
thick
and
creamy
in
nature
lasting
fairly
well
then
subsiding
to
a
small
covering
and
a
ring
along
the
edges
this
ring
helped
produce
a
thin
and
spotty
lace
down
the
glass
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
sweet
malt
big
sweet
dark
fruits
cherry
raisins
plums
spices
wood
and
some
alcohol
light
the
tastes
that
rolled
across
my
tongue
were
of
dark
fruits
cherries
plums
sweet
raisins
malt
sweet
and
dark
¬ñ
both
mixing
together
spices
licorice
cloves
deep
wood
like
an
aging
barrel
and
some
alcohol
it
left
behind
a
semisweet
spicy
flavor
on
the
tongue
that
was
very
pleasing
this
is
one
complete
and
balanced
beer
from
the
flavors
to
the
aromas
that
they
produce
pleasing
to
the
senses
and
packed
full
with
flavor
all
in
a
single
sip
or
wiff
very
enjoyable
and
will
be
looking
to
get
more
all
around
great
beer
i
recently
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
maxs
in
fells
point
its
a
very
impressive
ale
and
extremely
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
warning
i
found
it
somewhat
similar
to
the
s
n
celebration
in
body
and
impact
although
the
hop
content
is
far
less
stylistically
its
hard
to
placebelgian
in
origen
but
very
americanized
the
body
is
a
cloudy
deep
copper
mahogany
with
an
orange
cast
when
held
to
the
light
but
it
appears
much
darker
and
reddish
when
sitting
on
the
bar
its
creamy
yellowstained
ivory
head
holds
well
eventually
drops
to
a
nicely
creamy
collar
and
leaves
some
thin
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
bold
nose
expresses
lightly
sweet
and
fruity
raisins
prune
malt
with
a
touch
of
wood
and
spice
some
alcohol
adds
to
its
aroma
but
its
really
wellengrained
and
never
imposes
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
zesty
at
first
due
to
its
very
fine
and
gently
effervescent
carbonation
and
it
becomes
creamier
as
it
warms
enhancing
the
firmly
malty
body
the
flavor
is
rich
and
seductive
it
starts
with
soft
dark
fruit
and
sweet
malt
upfront
including
notes
of
raisin
plum
and
cherry
its
not
tart
at
all
and
the
fruity
notes
blend
flawlessly
into
the
sweet
dark
malt
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
some
woody
character
becomes
apparent
it
finishes
dry
with
a
mild
sweet
malt
followed
by
a
light
spiciness
some
clove
maybe
a
very
mild
touch
of
anise
and
then
some
residual
oak
extremely
wellbalanced
flavorful
and
complex
immensely
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
well
worth
seeking
out
for
the
lover
of
belgianstyle
beers
