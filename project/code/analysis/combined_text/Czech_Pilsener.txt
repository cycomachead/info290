pairs
well
with

like
if
a

and
a
czech
lager
had
a
baby
i
like
them
both
but
i
dont
like
their

this
was
a
surprisingly
good
beer
for
the
price
i
paid
i
had
a
good

was
very
drinkable
i
will
now
have
to
try
out
more
of

beers
used
this
one
for
cooking
beer
cheese
soup
decided
id
pour
it
in
a
glass
and
give
it
a
try
to
make
sure
it
was
worthy
to
cook
with

not
to

like
a

tastes
id
buy
this
again
if
i
were
ever
in
the
mood
for
a
pilsner
o
tjs
bohemian
lager
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
and
throws
serious
doubt
into
my
plans
to
start
homebrewing

when
this
can
be
purchased
at

a
sixer
rjt
for
the
taste
i
get
the
same
biscuit
and
malt
characters
up
front
along
with
the
butter
but
there
is
a
more
vibrant
clean
crisp
hop
finale
that
gives
it
a
new
lease
on
life
o
nothing
to
write
home
about
strictly
average
still
for
6
bucks
a
sixer
you
can
do
worse
good
enough
you
can
see
what
style
budweiser
is
trying
to
emulate
in
a
beer
like
this
clean
light
golden
yellow
with
a
great
head
quaffable
but
not
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
nice
pleasant
and
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
stock
up
the
fridge
the
powersthatbe
at
beeradvocate
com
might
do
well
to
reconsider
how
they
have
classified
this
beer
id
say
that
it
is
a
munich
helles
lager
not
a
czech
pilsener
one
can
easily
be
misled
by
the
words
crisp
and
refreshing
which
appear
prominently
on
the
bottle
but
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
for
a
decently

21
i
thought
this
beer
was
quite
drinkable
and
it
had
a
bit
more
upfront
flavor
than
some
pilsners
ive
had
i
tried
a
few
different
josephsbraus
since
you
can
make
your
own
sixpack
at
trader
joes
i
didnt
care
for
a
couple
of
the
others
so
my
expectations
were
probably
pretty
low
not
sure
if
ill
buy
it
again
but
i
would
certainly
grab
one
from
a
cooler
at
a
barbecue
or
picnic
for
a
pilsner
im
pretty
impressed
is
has
more
flavor
than
your
typical
mass
produced
pilsner
if
you
want
to
step
up
to
more
taste
without
taking
the
plunge
on
a
heavier
darker
beer
or
ipa
this
is
a
great
start
overall
a
solid
beer
all
the
right
components
but
rough
around
the
edges
this
doesnt
sit
well
up
front
but
has
a
nicer
finish
its
just
a
smidge
too
bitter
perhaps
not
hoppy
but
bitter
sparkly
honey
golden
yellow
overall
decent
pilsner
nothing
to
write
home
about
maybe
a
decent
gateway
beer
for
macro
drinkers
my
bottle
had
a
different
label
but
im
not
sure
if
that
means
i
had
a
newer
version
of
the
beer
o
plzner
is
another
highquality
lowpriced
tj
beer
that
really
delivers
the
value
a
few
little
tweaks
to
decrease
the
sweetness
and
moderate
the
bitterness
which
is
too
sharp
and
needs
to
be
softer
and
this
would
be
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
rjt
now
as
a
german
pils
its
again
not
bad
at
all
its
got
lots
of
noble
hop
bitterness
and
the
tartness
i
expect
but
its
lacking
enough
pils
malt
flavors
to
make
it
keep
it
from
being
a
one
note
wonder
its
definitely
a
a
celebration
of
noble
hops
yet
its
not
much
more
than
though
on
the
back
label
on
the
bottle
it
says
its
32
ibus
which
is
again
what
it
tastes
like
which
is
a
now
what
most
german
pils
are
again
its
not
bad
but
not
up
to
the
standards
of
the
beer
ive
been
drinking
from
franken
and
from
other
bayernbiere
a
3
5
of
5
overall
its
refreshing
enough
not
tjs
best
but
drinkable
best
before
date
52014
so
it
was
pretty
fresh
overall
sadly
i
only
had
one
at
my
disposal
or
i
probably
would
have
had
4
or
5
its
low
enough
in
alcohol
content
to
be
a
very
sessionable
beer
but
doesnt
overpower
the
palate
to
the
point
where
you
only
want
to
have
one
or
two
its
light
crisp
refreshing
and
has
a
perfect
balance
of
flavors
for
this
style
im
really
impressed
half
a
good
beer
with
a
good
price
ill
probably
grab
it
again
id
gladly
drink
either
of
these
tasty
beers
again
but
if
given
a
choice
between
the
two
id
reach
for
a
plnzr
overall
a
decent
enough
pils
as
always
trader
joes
has
a
great
pricevalue
for
their
store
brands
its
unbalanced
but
more
than
drinkable
not
my
favorite
czech
pilsner
however
it
is
refreshing
for
a
summers
day
o
very
mediocre
expected
more
even
from
trader
joes
brand
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
about
one
finger
of
paper
white
foam
that
fell
quickly
but
left
behind
some
sheeting
action
the
nose
is
of
cereallike
grains
and
crackers
with
some
floral
and
grassy
hops
over
top
floral
hops
pounce
on
the
palate
first
with
crackery
and
sweet
cereallike
grains
through
the
middle
a
little
bit
of
a
vegetal
character
before
a
finish
of
toasted
malt
and
grassy
bitterness
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
little
messy
moving
from
flavor
to
flavor
without
any
real
transitions
there
are
much
better
pilsner
options
out
there
this
is
largely
average
at
best
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
it
would
have
been
nicer
if
there
were
more
malts
in
the
taste
to
balance
off
some
of
the
hops
o
this
beer
seems
dark
for
the
style
at
least
much
darker
than
the
majority
of
the
others
in
the
style
i
have
tried
the
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
great
either
probably
a
decent
choice
when
you
factor
in
the
price
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
light
yellowish
golden
amber
with
a
thin
film
of
head
that
dissipates
immediately
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
mild
aroma
of
bready
malt
and
grassy
hops
flavor
is
mild
biscuit
malt
with
light
lemon
finishing
with
a
somewhat
astringent
dry
grassy
hops
not
a
particularly
pleasant
flavor
transition
nor
well
balanced
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
most
the
joseph
brau
beers
have
been
uninspiring
but
pleasant
to
drink
this
one
is
miss
for
me
much
more
bitter
than
expected
and
with
more
caramel
malt
character
theres
a
metallic
flavor
that
emerges
as
it
warms
a
bit
onenote
i
suppose
but
this
is
quite
a
refreshing
and
carefully
constructed
lager
and
an
excellent
value
taste
is
a
nice
combo
of
grainy
malts
with
a
herbal
grassy
hops
not
bad
this
is
one
of
the
more
affordable
pilsners
out
there
and
it
is
better
than
60
of
the
imports
that
are
more
expensive
i
like
it
but
unfortnately
a
tj
is
about
30
miles
away
d
not
great
but
definitely
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
as
well
light
body
moderately
full
carbonation
some
residual
sweetness
and
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
hell
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
for
6
49
a
sixer
and
even
not
considering
the
price
i
like
it
for
an
american
pilsner
ive
never
quite
been
able
to
put
my
full
support
behind
prima
pils
i
think
ill
get
this
one
many
more
times
considering
this
price
and
worthy
taste
offers
a
decent
feel
and
carbonation
bit
sweet
and
neutral
in
delivery
and
with
a
light
hop
presence
bit
nondescript
overall
not
a
bad
beer
overall
a
decent
refreshing
pilsner
great
for
the
summer
o
when
i
first
grabbed
this
beer
i
was
afraid
it
was
just
a
relabeling
of
the
josephsbrau
bohemian
lager
but
this
is
a
much
nicer
brew
while
not
so
much
czech
as
german
in
its
pils
character
its
a
great
rendition
of
the
style
from
a
us
micro
very
easydrinking
and
perfect
on
a
warm
summer
day
o
overall
its
not
the
greatest
czech
pilsner
out
there
but
its
pretty
hard
to
complain
when
a
sixer
runs
what
bmc
type
stuff
does
definitely
a
good
value
o
pleasantly
surprised
to
say
the
least
tastes
like
a
ten
dollar
a
six
pack
beer
instead
only
5
50
damn
the
body
was
mostly
the
expected
clean
crispness
of
the
style
but
the
finish
was
a
bit
on
the
sticky
side
drinkability
was
ok
id
have
a
couple
under
the
right
circumstances
overall
a
decent
enough
brew
especially
at
the
price
point
its
at
worth
grabbing
a
sixer
for
a
cookout
at
the
park
or
to
use
as
a
training
wheel
beer
to
get
someone
away
from
the
bland
mainstream
beers
d
not
really
the
best
pilsner
out
there
the
grain
flavor
is
flat
and
a
bit
sour
totally
lacking
in
pilsner
malt
depth
the
hops
have
a
significant
presence
but
they
are
almost
more
british
than
german
in
character
and
do
nothing
to
help
the
already
harsh
malt
character
not
one
of
my
favorites
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
lively
carbonation
with
the
trader
joes
label
one
automatically
thinks
cheap
but
this
is
a
solid
czech
style
pilsner
in
my
book
overall
nice
full
flavored
malted
beer
but
fairly
simple
i
really
think
this
lager
should
be
considered
an
american
adjunct
lager
it
is
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
just
reminds
me
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
there
is
a
lack
of
saaz
hop
spiciness
that
i
always
look
forward
from
this
style
of
lager
but
for
the
price
i
think
it
puts
most
american
adjuncts
to
shame
this
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
generous
cottonbillowy
layer
of
foam
looks
great
but
the
aroma
disappoints
its
there
but
nothing
stands
out
where
are
my
grassy
saaz
hops
flavor
is
more
er
less
of
the
same
its
all
sort
of
meh
middleoftheroad
not
horrible
but
not
something
id
pick
up
for
myself
again
seems
consistent
with
the
other
josephbrau
offerings
ive
tried
however
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
to
brag
about
it
is
not
the
beer
id
offer
to
my
best
friend
or
to
my
worst
enemy
however
it
is
rather
refreshing
its
a
good
beer
for
a
cool
evening
during
an
early
spring
when
youre
sitting
inside
unwinding
but
still
have
a
todo
list
to
conquer
by
the
end
of
the
night
overall
a
decent
take
on
a
european
pilsner
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
and
has
a
decent
body
for
the
style
this
is
a
nice
american
version
of
a
czech
pilsner
o
not
good
d
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
czech
pilsener
poured
a
golden
clear
color
produced
a
average
white
head
average
retention
and
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
left

the
aroma
consisted
of
sweet
malted
grain
moderate
body
this
pils
has
a
base
flavor
of
sweet
malt
baked
bread
and
hops
overall
its
merely
an
average
example
of
a
czech
pils
if
our
on
a
budget
its
a
nice
value
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
prost
o
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
of
czech
pils
out
there
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
i
would
not
turn
others
away
from
it
the
aroma
is
plain
with
just
malt
and
grassy
hops
the
appearance
is
golden
with
an
average
head
for
the
style
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
noticeable
bitterness
but
not
bad
at
all
the
palate
is
typical
for
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
o
despite
the
low
cost
about
1bottle
this
is
a
disappointing
offering
not
worthy
of
a
recommendation
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
maltgrain
and
some
slight
vegetal
aromas
taste
is
of
maltgrain
grassy
flavors
and
an
herbal
hop
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
light
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
pilsner
but
nothing
too
offensive
12

deep
golden
with
a
shortlived
white

nice
aroma
is
of
pale
malt
and
grassy
hops
medium
slightly
crisp
body
earthy
hops
are
balanced
by
biscuit
malt
and
grapefruit
on
the
palate
long
bitter
finish
well
done
pils
slightly
disappointing
as
dont
feel
as
though
it
is
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
josephbrau
offerings
but
at
66pack
not
a
horrible
value
o
while
there
was
some
diacetyl
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
it
was
within
the
style
guidelines
the
malt
aroma
and
flavor
was
pleasant
however
there
was
not
much
of
a
noticeable
hop
aroma
should
be
spicy
in
either
the
smell
or
taste
this
aroma
is
necessary
for
this
style
also
there
just
seemed
to
be
too
much
astringency
which
made
the
bitterness
sharp
the
astringency
can
be
avoided
by
making
sure
your
ph
does
not
get
too
high
when
sparging
also
the
astringency
could
be
related
to
leaving
the
hops
in
the
boil
for
too
long
overall
drinkability
a
nice
pilsner
good
flavor
and
smell
but
a
tad
disappointing
in
regards
to
appearance
nice
to
see
the
czechgerman
hops
typical
for
this
style
so
well
represented
with
this
beer
went
quite
well
a
meal
sicilian
corkscrews
beans
and
would
go
well
with
a
lot
of
other
food
as
well
good
drinkability
as
well
i
could
have
another
without
hesitation
o
disappointing
since
the
last
few
tjs
beers
ive
had
have
overperformed
this
is
ok
tastes
like
a
lower
end
import
in
the
end
is
it
a
great
beer
no
am
i
unhappy
that
i
spent
six
dollars
on
the
six
pack
nuhuh
will
i
buy
another
one
nope
apparently
a
gordon
biersch
product
ohio
state
liquor
board
lists
the
josephs
brau
beers
under
gb
reminds
me
of
gb
golden
bock
though
scratchier
t
very
smooth
bready
malts
upfront
with
a
trace
of
grassy
and
resinous
hops
in
the
back
a
faint
but
lingering
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
to
be
honest
this
beer
was
close
but
didnt
quite
have
the
style
down
the
malts
are
there
but
the
hops
dont
shine
enough
to
give
it
that
refreshing
bite
that
good
czech
pilsners
have
still
not
a
bad
beer
though
and
maybe
my
favorite
of
the
josephs
brau
offerings
overall
nicely
hopped
but
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
otherwise
expect
nevertheless
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
have
had
it
many
times
as
it
is
often
on
the
menu
at
local
restaurants
surprised
i
havent
rated
it
before
gets
better
as
you
drink
it
o
very
drinkable
pilsner
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
head
is
a
bout
a
finger
and
a
half
and
lacing
is
nice
and
slow
aroma
is
of
a
fine
pilsner
taste
has
a
nice
amount
of
hops
balanced
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
citrus
bitterness
balances
well
and
presents
a
very
nice
top
of
the
line
pilsner
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
gold
the
foamy
white
head
has
good
retention
and
lasts
well
into
the
beer
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
comes
with
it
mild
biscuit
aroma
and
the
taste
adds
just
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
just
an
average
pilsner
this
was
a
refreshing
pilsner
it
was
different
from
a
lot
of
pilsners
i
have
tried
which
is
a
good
thing
foothills
is
a
great
beer
maker
they
have
a
good
variety
of
styles
and
the
torch
goes
well
with
their
lineup
this
beer
complimented
my
dinner
well
i
had
a
great
burger
and
homemade
chips
o
one
of
my
very
favorites
recently
this
is
a
goto
for
me
it
may
be
obvioius
that
im
a
pilsner
guy
but
this
is
extraordinary
imo
and
when
its
on
sale
for
86
which
is
pretty
frequently
here
in
durham
nc
its
hard
for
me
to
choose
anything
else
i
love
torch
nice
it
has
dull
straw
gold
color
theres
a
bit
of
a
cloudy
haze
to
it
big
foamy
white
head
and
some
lacing
behind
wheaty
scent
to
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
some
malts
taste
is
grains
hops
some
malts
a
touch
of
lemon
smooth
and
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
o
overall
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
but
i
feel
like
the
bitterness
level
on
this
guy
is
a
little
high
for
my
tastes
i
want
a
crisp
and
clean
finish
that
this
one
falls
short
on
o
overall
a
decent
pilsner
not
a
ton
going
on
but
easy
to
drink
and
solid
good
session
beer
and
would
go
well
with
a
veggie
curry
light
golden
hued
with
great
clarity
just
a
faint
wisp
of
foam
partially
covers
the
top
aroma
of
saaz
hops
and
czech
lager
yeast
is
prevalent
mouth
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
a
nice
gentle
saaz
hop
bitterness
that
beckons
for
additional
sips
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
orange
straw
with
little
to
no
white
head
smells
of
nice
grain
profile
very
sweet
tastes
of
sweet
grain
nice
profile
beer
is
heavily
carbonated
nice
and
smooth
overall
an
above
average
beer
this
one
has
grown
on
me
it
is
a
typical
czech
pilsner
i
think
the
first
bomber
i
got
to
this
had
been
left
too
long
somewhere
either
on
my
own
neglect
or
the
store
i
purchased
it
it
pours
a
nice
straightforward
pilsner
the
color
is
golden
straw
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
which
for
this
style
is
perfectly
normal
and
something
i
look
for
the
smell
is
where
it
is
truly
at
its
best
it
s
great
smelling
beer
full
of
grainy
aroma
and
character
the
taste
still
doesnt
fully
do
it
for
me
it
is
bitter
and
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
i
expect
the
bitterness
in
an
ipa
and
some
ales
but
this
one
should
be
more
on
the
malt
side
of
things
when
i
think
of
a
pilsner
i
think
of
a
beer
that
is
highly
sessionable
but
i
wouldnt
do
that
with
this
one
overall
i
do
like
it
but
would
choose
another
one
to
drink
a
few
of
overall
i
do
like
this
beer
and
think
that
it
is
fairly
representative
of
the
style
i
would
like
for
it
to
be
a
little
less
of
that
hairspray
bitterness
and
more
of
the
grainy
goodness
that
comes
through
in
the
aroma
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
pale
honeygold
coloring
with
little
to
no
head
nose
of
floral
hops
highlight
a
subtle
roast
and
bitterness
throughout
flavors
are
floral
and
peppery
forward
with
a
heavy
roast
and
bitter
hops
character
at
the
end
some
richly
sweet
notes
of
honey
ribbon
throughout
the
palate
also
smooth
bodied
with
a
very
clean
aftertaste
the
finish
is
very
crisp
and
clean
an
interesting
twist
on
the
pilsner
and
tasty
o
a
decent
pilsner
could
have
been
great
if
the
malt
backbone
hadnt
been
so
shall
we
say
robust
worth
drinking
again
but
not
worth
getting
a
6
pack
of
again
o
pretty
ambivalent
about
this
one
also
proud
to
say
that
its
made
in
my
home
state
of
n
c
it
comes
off
almost
more
german
to
my
sense
with
not
much
noble
sensing
hop
character
but
still
an
enjoyable
pilsner
to
drink
with
its
thick
malt
presence
this
was
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
i
dont
think
ill
buy
this
beer
again
its
a
little
bitter
and
not
refreshing
enough
for
me
to
warrant
keeping
this
around
overall
easy
drinking
session
beer
mo
a
nice
beer
picked
up
a
six
on
a
road
trip
to
north
carolina
it
was
definitely
worth
the
purchase
overall
very
drinkable
beer
probably
would
have
again
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
sure
its
not
as
flavorful
or
as
crisp
as
some
other
versions
of
the
style
but
still
a
solid
choice
especially
in
the
warmer
months
a
good
pilsner
a
little
heavier
on
the
grainy
sweetness
than
i
would
like
good
spice
presence
just
settles
down
a
little
too
heavily
making
it
not
as
bright
or
refreshing
as
i
want
recommended
for
pilsner
fans
super
easy
drinking
pils
not
perfect
but
one
i
would
buy
again
if
i
could
get
it
here
i
liked
this
as
much
as
prima
pils
overall
4
25
this
is
an
excellent
pilsner
id
love
to
have
this
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
because
its
so
wellcrafted
for
the
style
that
itd
be
a
great
crossover
beer
for
those
who
arent
so
familiar
with
or
deep
into
craft
great
for
hot
weather
drinking
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
pilsners
or
looking
for
local
talent
when
in
north
carolina
overall
it
is
refreshing
and
relatively
crisp
with
a
decent
herbal
hop
profile
a
decent
and
pretty
easy
drinking
pilsner
o
a
really
nice
try
its
refreshing
crisp
and
feels
like
i
just
stuffed
my
mouth
with
wonderbread
and
butter
which
i
like
however
the
hop
schedule
needs
tweaking
to
finish
this
beer
im
going
to
try
it
again
in
the
summer
just
to
see
if
i
like
it
better
end
all
much
better
than
generic
pilsners
out
there
o
nice
and
refreshing
im
not
much
of
a
pilsner
drinker
but
i
could
drink
this
pretty
much
anytime
o
one
of
the
better
pilseners
that
i
have
had
from
nc
i
enjoy
the
additional
hop
flavors
from
the
citrus
hops
that
really
add
a
little
something
extra
to
the
taste
and
smell
very
enjoyable
and
quite
easy
to
drink
a
session
beer
the
combination
of
the
dryness
of
the
taste
herbal
tastehopiness
and
overall
appearence
make
this
pilsner
shine
excellent
overall
a
tasty
pilsner
better
than
most
o
real
nice
summer
beer
i
would
prefered
if
it
was
a
touch
crisper
but
i
could
see
drinking
this
as
a
warm
weather
thirst
quencher
overall
this
isnt
the
best
interpretation
of
a
czech
pils
out
there
its
nice
but
as
my
first
foothills
beer
it
was
underwhelming
this
is
has
to
be
the
most
balanced
and
refreshing
czech
style
pilsner
i
have
in
a
long
time
i
seriously
can
not
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
proud
that
it
is
brewed
in
my
home
state
nc
if
you
want
a
pilsner
with
a
kick
find
it
overall
not
bad
it
can
be
my
if
all
else
fails
give
me
one
beer
overall
good
stuff
not
quite
a
typical
european
pils
but
it
has
some
resemblance
to
urquell
pours
a
clear
glowing
gold
with
a
sudsy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
slight
haze
and
ring
nice
aromas
of
grainy
malt
lemon
zest
crackers
and
noble
hops
taste
is
mostly
dominated
by
the
grainy
cracker
malt
and
more
noble
saaz
hops
along
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
bread
dough
mouthfeel
is
properly
crisp
with
a
mediumthin
body
and
good
sharp
carbonation
overall
its
not
the
most
overthetop
beer
in
the
world
but
a
damn
fine
pilsner
that
is
perfectly
amble
after
a
days
work
o
this
was
a
solid
pilsener
that
would
be
divine
on
a
warm
summer
day
o
a
very
solid
bohemian
and
better
than
most
in
fact
torch
pilsner
is
a
super
clean
refreshing
quaff
that
begs
for
outdoors
and
a
hot
day
to
compliment
the
drinking
experience
happy
to
have
tried
this
one
pour
is
a
crystal
clear
golden
orange
with
a
rather
tight
creamy
white
head
the
nose
is
pretty
decent
a
little
heavy
on
the
grain
but
adds
notes
of
doughy
bread
and
and
some
leafy
green
hops
the
taste
is
slightly
more
balanced
but
still
a
touch
heavy
on
the
grain
grain
doughy
malts
some
sweet
caramel
and
honey
transitions
to
some
green
leafy
hop
notes
the
finish
is
faintly
dry
highly
carbonated
and
a
bit
rough
on
the
back
of
the
throat
solid
pilsner
overall
a
decent
pilsener
but
one
that
is
readily
surpassed
by
others
in
the
style
i
would
happily
drink
it
again
were
it
offered
but
would
take
no
great
effort
to
seek
it
out
o
solid
beer
id
def
purchase
again
one
of
my
favorites
from
foothills
thus

with
an
inch
of
pure
white
foam
pleasant
spicy

nose
slightly
sweet
pale

toasty
grain

faint

and
some

more

in
the

sweet
fresh
grain
and
a
lingering
peppery
bitterness
very
refreshing
and
chugdownable
body
is
a
little
better
than
light
and
is
crisp
ive
had
this
on
tap
a
number
of
times
and
its
nice
to
see
it
in
a
bottle
good
local
pils
arrived
a
clear
medium
yellow
with
a
decent
head
and
good
retention
had
more
caramel
malt
taste
that
a
lot
of
pilsners
i
have
had
bitterness
was
moderate
with
a
crisp
fairly
dry
finish
overall
an
ok
pils
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
pure
gold
with
thick
head
that
stays
around
nose
is
pure
strawwheat
taste
offers
light
malt
and
a
decent
balance
of
hops
after
a
few
sips
the
malts
become
a
little
sweet
light
bodied
carbonated
well
and
crisp
a
very
good
pilsner
flavor
was
similar
but
perhaps
a
bit
more
full
than
was
the
aroma
a
very
enjoyable
pilsener
crisp
in
body
a
perfect
summer
beer
quite
refreshing
beer
is
light
to
medium
in
body
lead
off
mild
sweetness
mild
bitterness
from
hops
at
the
end
between
is
just
sweet
and
wet
not
overly
sweet
its
a
nice
round
subtle
flavor
highly
drinkable
yum
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
and
slight
bitter
hops
the
flavor
was
of
bitter
malt
wheat
skunk
slight
bitter
hops
and
subtle
banana
on
the
followthrough
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
the
skunk
aspect
was
a
little
surprising
but
didnt
kill
the
brew
at
all
all
of
the
flavors
worked
really
well
together
on
this
one
but
it
just
wasnt
aweinspiring
aroma
was
a
little
weak
in
intensity
for
my
liking
but
still
decent
this
is
a
must
try
at
least
once
looks
the
part
of
a
typical
pilsener
with
a
rich
golden
color
and
a
thin
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
dull
earthy
bitterness
that
is
pleasant
but
a
bit
muted
the
flavor
is
more
potent
with
the
same
noble
hop
character
coming
through
on
top
of
a
decent
malt
base
the
texture
is
a
bit
thicker
than
a
typical
pilsener
being
more
resinous
than
crisp
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
impress
growler
station
was
limited
for
my
tastes
and
i
was
looking
for
an
ipa
settled
for
a
pilsner
instead
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
little
head
as
expected
grassy
and
grainy
with
a
slight
hint
of
noble
hops
as
a
pils
should
be
drinks
really
well
and
is
a
solid
offering
from
foothills
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
visible
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
white
head
without
too
much
lacing
as
it
goes
down
nose
is
some
light
grass
and
bread
with
a
few
hops
light
european
hop
character
and
grass
in
the
taste
light
and
crisp
bit
nothing
too
interesting
drank
many
of
these
at
the
carolina
ale
house
in
raleigh
pretty
pedestrian
draft
selection
but
this
was
a
pretty
solid
choice
mostly
clear
golden
color
clean
grassy
lightly
sweet
aroma
clean
crisp
nice
grassy
hop
flavor
with
a
pale
malt
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
lemon
and
a
modest
spicy
bitter
hoppiness
in
the
finish
not
on
the
level
of
the
very
good
pilseners
i
am
used
to
living
in
pa
but
a
solid
brew
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
an
inch
head
w
lacing
down
the
glass
mild
malty
aroma
assertive
lemony
malt
flavor
with
a
burst
of
hops
to
balance
light
bodied
crisp
and
very
drinkable
i
had
two
pints
and
wanted
more
this
would
be
a
great
hot
weather
beer
an
absolutely
great
and
authentic
pils
foothills
gets
better
and
better
as
the
days
go
on
and
when
they
can
brew
a
traditional
lower
alcohol
brew
like
this
and
have
it
impress
almost
as
much
as
their
much
more
limited
bourbonbarrel
experiments
you
know
theyre
doing
it
right
drinkability
easy
quaffing
pils
that
is
a
bit
light
on
the
flavor
profile
but
still
tasty
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
on
tap
d
i
enjoyed
this
but
there
are
a
lot
better
pilseners
out
there
to
be
sure
glad
i
tried
it
nonetheless
and
it
is
another
solid
foothills
product
keg
from
the
guys
at
charletson
beer
exchange
v
good
but
not
quite
gr8
beer

not

making
up
own
mind
having
tasted
lots
of
pils
in
russia
where
urquell
sp
was
pushed
on
people
and
was
of
low
quality
this
was
a
pleasant
upgrade
from
that
more
skunky
variety
had
never
thought
about
whether
beer
leaves
suds
down
the
side
of
glass
pours
clear
golden
with
a
fluffy
head
and
nice
carbonation
streamers
the
aroma
is
sweet
pilsner
malt
with
a
sting
of
noble
hops
the
flavor
is
malty
and
honeylike
with
a
pleasant
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
the
finish
is
fairly
crisp
the
downside
is
the
sourness
that
develops
late
with
a
peanuty
flavor
and
mouthfeel
overall
sour
finish
brings
down
the
drinkability
d
very
high
this
one
doesnt
last
very
long
this
started
out
a
little
rough
but
the
clean
taste
and
crisp
nature
of
this
ended
up
making
for
a
solid
pils
drinking
experience
at
least
enough
to
nicely
compliment
my
accompanying
12
lb
pub
melt
yum
the
beer
is
light
and
has
a
nice
dry
aftertaste
very
nice
active
carbonation
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
for
this
style
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
and
imo
has
been
very
much
underappreciated
by
the
reviewer
of
this
beer
thus
far
as
do
most
lighter
colored
beers
and
some
for
good
reason
overall
an
excellent

this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
thick
white

the
aroma
is
of
wheat
and
light
fruits
the
flavor
is
sweet

with
a

this
was

i

it
was
a

a

the

quaffable
this

have
another

adds
another
solid
if
a
bit
unexciting
brew
to
their
stellar
lineup
d
this
wasnt
a
horrible
brew
to
drink
but
if
i
wanted
something
more
id
pick
a
german
pils
or
an
apwa
if
i
wanted
something
less
id
opt
for
a
brooklyn
lager
or
even
pbr
not
particularly
suited
to
etiher
crowd
aside
from
the
simplicity
of
this
brew
it
is
quite
drinkable
drinks
very
smooth
and
clean
not
a
choice
id
pick
for
flavor
but
for
refreshment
this
is
one
of
the
hoppier
pilseners
ive
ever
tasted
that
said
its
not
really
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
i
absolutely
loved
the
taste
citrusy
pine
hops
balanced
by
a
light
note
of
biscuity
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
heaver
side
of
lightbodied
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
with
a
lingering
hoppy
bite
to
the
finish
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
by
the
good
folks
at
foothills
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
very
drinkable
and
would
go
great
with
any
light
fare
or
german
food
served
a
crisp
pale
orange
with
a
thin
head
that
diminished
to
nothing
there
was
almost
no
aroma
whatsoever
i
was
able
to
pull
a
little
with
a
good
swirl
of
the
glass
the
taste
had
a
decent
complexity
with
an
almost
ipalike
finish
the
beer
was
crisp
and
smooth
and
very
easy
drinking
this
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
but
theres
far
better
stuff
out
there
this
came
with
a
thick
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
throughout
the
nose
had
a
distinct
saaz
hops
aroma
the
color
was
a
deep
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
mouthfeel
was
lighttomedium
with
an
intriguing
light
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
did
experience
a
medium
hop
bite
on
the
finish
but
it
needed
to
be
hoppier
throughout
imho
torch
is
my
favorite
of
the
regular
rotation
at
foothills
but
that
is
more
a
result
of
my
taste
than
its
i
love
a
great
pilsner
and
can
make
do
with
an
average
one
unfortunately
torch
is
pretty
average
but
it
is
not
bad
by
any
means
just
average
the
individual
parts
of
the
beer
all
are
fine
but
seem
to
add
up
to
less
than
the
sum
making
the
beer
less
smooth
and
drinkable
than
it
should
be
the
beer
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
nice
darker
golden
body
underneath
a
white
head
that
holds
a
nice
film
and
laces
well
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
spicy
czech
hops
and
sweet
pilsner
malt
the
taste
is
also
very
hop
forward
balanced
by
the
malts
with
a
nice
bitter
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
great
for
the
style
enough
body
but
still
light
for
drinkability
overall
a
very
drinkable
pilsner
not
a
german
style
as
listed
on
this
site
but
a
nice
czech
style
one
while
its
forgivable
butter
character
provides
a
charming
sense
of
fullness
the
beer
doesnt
let
that
interfere
with
its
refreshing
and
hopforward
finish
with
elements
of
mint
leaf
and
stem
stewing
late
an
aftertaste
of
honeysuckle
reward
the
senses
one
last
time
overall
this
was
a
really
good
pilsner
and
totally
away
from
what
i
was
expecting
it
was
light
enough
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
or
in
large
numbers
but
at
the
same
time
had
enough
character
enough
profile
to
carry
its
own
weight
even
at
night
this
was
a
superb
choice
at
the
time
and
a
really
good
brew
i
would
definatly
order
this
up
again
prosit

snappy
crisp
hop
presence
with
clean
pilsner
malts
apparently
much
improved
over
my
previously
reviewed
version
near
the
top
of
the
nc
pilsner
heap
flavor
was
full
of
husks
and
grain
flavors
kind
of
like
digging
my
teeth
into
an
sevengrain
bread
that
was
flavored
with
alcohol
slight
hop
bite
that
was
more
citrus
than
pine
medium
body
perhaps
a
tad
too
much
hops
kind
of
threw
this
beer
out
of
balance
this
beer
was
a
good
lighter
beer
the
smell
was
macro
like
and
the
taste
was
too
but
ice
cold
this
sure
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
afternoon
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
average
for
the
style
this
could
be
a
session
beer
with
ease
i
wish
i
had
one
right
now
body
is
a
hair
below
medium
with
a
very
brisk
and
crisp
mouthfeel
with
some
light
minerality
in
the
finish
the
body
is
light
which
is
good
per
style
there
is
a
good
backing
but
some
lighter
sense
almost
gives
it
a
watered
down
taste
truthfully
i
didnt
notice
but
it
was
by
other
in
my
party
so
overall
it
was
a
good
american
pilsner
poured
a
little
deeper
golden
color
than
alot
of
pilsners
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
took
awhile
to
come
downaromas
of
lightly
toasted
grain
and
corn
husk
and
very
fresh
nice
and
well
rounded
pils
here
a
firm
dry
malt
base
holds
up
very
nice
to
a
lip
smacking
dry
herbal
hoppy
finish
very
clean
in
the
finish
a
nice
sturdy
pilsner
that
is
very
food
freindly
to
booti
really
enjoyed
this
one
an
acquaintance
brought
this
over
he
didnt
know
any
better
d
an
excellent
very
drinkable
but
sophisticated
beer
highly
recommended
this
is
a
very
typical
pilsener
bright
in
the
glass
easy
on
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
corn
sweetness
and
saaz
hops
at
the
end
of
the
tongue
an
enjoyable
alternative
to
pilsener
urquell
stale
smell
and
below
average
in
taste
not
my
style
of

bright
golden
color
white
frothy
head
from

it
fades
clean
earthy
aroma
taste
is
crisp
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
some
grassy
hops
thin
body

slick

easy
to
drink
pretty
good
overall
enjoy
this
isnt
all
that
good
i
dont
know
fresh
it
is
but
no
beer
of
this
kind
or
really
any
kind
should
be
put
in
green
bottles
great
even
taste
no
complexities
purchased
in
bratislava
from
a
store
typical
pilsnerlager
its
not
budweiser
o
nothing
overly
interesting
here
golden

are

of
a

there
are
certainly
better
ones
an
inoffensive
but
otherwise
not
very
interesting
euro
lager
now
that
ive
tried
it
i
dont
think
ill
need
to
have
another
one
pours
a
pretty
gold
in
color
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
that
lasted
a
while
decent
amount
of
lacing
was
seen
also
when
sipped
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
since
most
of
brews
that
come
in
a
green
bottle
is
on
the
skunky
side
for
some
reason
this
was
not
the
case
with
this
one
at
all
the
aroma
is
of
malts
and
hops
for
the
most
part
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
there
is
a
slight
nutty
flavor
in
there
also
because
the
malts
and
hops
a
very
light
hoppy
finsih
that
doesnt
last
great
taste
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
give
this
87
out
of
100
o
not
a
bad
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
its
far
from
being
my
goto
when
the
mercury
starts
to
rise
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
go
far
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
it
again
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
mind
you
i
just
think
that
there
are
better
offerings
out
there
12oz
pint
glass
a
nice
example
of
what
a
nice
pilsener
tastes
like
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
500
ml
green
bottle
fortunately
i
failed
to
detect
any
skunk
this
pilsener
is
a
honey
gold
hue
with
an
impressive
rich
white
head
around
five
inches
or
so
stands
out
from
many
other
pilseners
in
this
latter
regard
aroma
is
rich
pilsener
malt
and
a
subdued
noble
hops
spice
the
smell
was
middling
or
just
below
this
but
fortunately
the
taste
compensated
not
a
super
dry
or
bitter
pils
but
with
a
rich
malt
character
and
assertive
hopping
for
a
european
macrobrew
admittedly
much
better
than
i
expected
cracker
and
sweet
bread
malts
predominate
but
there
are
also
very
nice
noble
hop
spice
and
fragrant
hay
flavors
particularly
in
the
semidry
finish
along
with
sweet
honey
and
vanilla
notes
almost
evokes
raisins
for
a
moment
i
dont
get
much
of
the
characteristic
saaz
floralherbal
character
there
is
some
diacetyl
which
actually
works
well
contributing
to
a
somewhat
buttery
mouthfeel
that
fits
many
descriptions
of
the
czech
style
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
bit
chewier
than
a
german
pils
i
also
detect
a
mild
fruitiness
honestly
a
rather
impressive
czech
pils
straight
from
the
source
well
slovakia
i
dig
the
complexity
and
softer
sweeter
roundedoff
corners
your
mileage
may
vary
of
course
style
purists
might
consider
some
of
the
traits
i
enjoyed
here
to
be
faults
the
only
delta
i
could
see
was
that
it
tended
to
drink
a
bit
flat
and
not
crisp
like
i
was
expecting
but
really
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
say
i
must
agree
with
most
of
the
people
who
talk
about
this
beer
had
this
at
1
slovak
pub
in
bratislava
a
great
environment
the
beer
is
served
in
what
is
called
tankovar
in
slovakia
and
in
cech
republic
too
which
means
it
is
brought
in
unpasteurized
in
tanks
this
gives
the
beer
a
distinct
earthy
taste
that
is
not
found
in
the
bottled
version
in
slovakia
of
course
this
beer
is
far
cheaper
than
in
north
america
so
it
may
not
be
worth
buying
if
you
live
in
americas
instead
perhaps
try
another
more
widely
available
cech
pilsner
such
as
staropramen
or
pilsner
urquell
overall
a
step
above
from
the
other
euro
pale
lagers
that
i
have
tried
in
the
past
there
is
a
nice
grassy
hop
finish
that
stands
out
in
this
brew
in
comparison
to
its
competition
this
beer
pours
a
really
medium
yellow
not
nearly
as
pale
as
coors
light
or
that
kind
of
stuff
the
head
is
pretty
generous
at
3
fingers
worth
and
the
smell
is
really
hoppy
almost
like
a
proper
pilsner
the
taste
is
fantastic
for
a
euro
lager
it
is
much
more
hoppy
than
any
of
the
big
brands
with
a
smooth
finish
and
a
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
on
the
tongue
if
you
enjoy
a
good
pilsner
youll
take
well
to
this
definitely
grabbing
this
again
overall
a
solid
pils
that
is
enjoyable
accessible
and
is
a
bit
smoother
than
others
in
the
style
a
recommended
buy
for
pils
lovers
smells
of
pils
malt
sweetness
and
spicy
saazlike
hops
with
some
obvious
skunking
green
bottles
still
not
bad
though
the
flavor
is
right
there
also
first
the
malts
make
themselves
known
but
then
the
minerally
hop
bitterness
comes
in
and
gives
the
beer
a
drying
impression
overall
not
that
much
different
that
some
other
green
bottle
pils
but
maybe
not
so
onedimensional
as
urquell
and
a
bit
smoother
on
the
palate
probably
would
get
consistenly
higher
ratings
if
they
switched
from
the
green
bottles
overall
not
a
bad
pilsener
at
all
but
with
an
equivalent
of
au60
for
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
is
it
worth
it
i
dont
think
so
just
get
a
different
cheaper
equivalent
czeck
or
german
pilsener
which
are
just
as
good
this
simply
doesnt
have
the
cut
above
factor
that
would
make
the
extra
cost
worth
while
overall
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
this
style
which
is
generally
hit
or
miss
for
me
id
have
to
say
this
was
better
than
i
expected
a
descent
and
good
czech
pils
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
out
a
really
good
beer
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
a
good
representation
of
the
style
would
be
a
great
beer
for
the
islands
in
the
caribbean
very
drinkable
yet
still
nicely
flavorful
much
better
than
american
lagers
o
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
but
it
isnt
as
malty
compared
to
other
pilseners
o
this
beer
is
enjoyable
the
flavor
while
slightly
sweet
initially
there
is
a
pretty
good
balance
to
the
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
sessionable
o
a
classic
czech
pils
in
many
respects
not
best
in
class
but
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
brew
well
worth
a
try
or
two
o
refreshing
summer
beer
nice
example
of
the
style
500
ml
bottle
pale
yellow
with
foamy
white
head
skunky
smell
fills
the
air
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
top
taste
is
light
and
watery
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
that
hangs
around
after
swallowing
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
beer
no
off
tastes
very
easy
to
drink
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
this
is
a
classic
bohemian
pils
a
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
and
begs
for
more
tastes
its
lighter
in
mouthfeel
and
body
than
budvar
or
urquell
but
not
as
delicate
as
some
german
pilsners
very
nice
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
rich
golden
color
with
lots
of
rising
carbonation
and
two
fingers
of
foamy
yellowish
head
the
retention
was
good
and
the
lacing
consistent
the
aroma
was
of
macro
grains
corn
pale
malt
and
some
faintly
grassy
hops
the
flavors
were
less
macro
than
the
aroma
but
still
centered
around
the
dry
grainy
corn
and
pale
malt
i
also
tasted
some
sweet
malt
bread
and
a
touch
of
citrus
and
herbs
in
the
hops
clean
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
nice
a
good
example
of
the
style
even
if
not
a
great
stand
alone
beer
this
beer
was
given
to
me
from
a
guy
i
work
with
strangely
enough
i
havent
had
this
one
before
the
beer
poured
out
s
a
lightly
hazy
looking
yellow
color
the
head
was
white
it
had
a
decent
retention
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
earthy
and
gives
off
that
grassy
pilsner
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sharp
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
with
a
sweet
malt
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
clean
and
crisp
overall
its
a
pretty
good
pilsner
i
actually
enjoy
this
one
a
good
beer
all
around
and
one
that
might
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
overall
once
again
this
beer
put
a
smile
on
my
face
and
reminds
me
of
certain
memories
in
the
easten
block
a
good
pilsner
from
slovakia
that
i
will
enjoy
for
many
years
ahead

a

b
overall
a
great
pils
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
out
an
i
will
definitely
purchase
it
again
the
future
o
overall
incredibly
underwhelming
and
lackluster
beer
wont
buy
again
but
atleast
i
check
off
another
country

smell
is

grass
and
some

taste
is
of
grains
and
grassy
flavors
with
a
mild
herbal

quality
on
the
finish
a
very
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
carbonation
level
with
a
nice
crip
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pilsener
but
nothing
too
exciting
overall
similar
to
many
other
region
beers
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
slightly
layered
beer
a
pleasant
surprise
not
a
pils
however
dr
its
far
too
expensive
in
ireland
but
i
assume
its
affordable
elsewhere
its
a
garbage
beer
not
to
be
consumed
by
proper
beer
fanatics
500ml

snifter

head
with
decent
retention
on
top
of
a
clean
body
solid
lacing
for
the
style
aroma
isnt
quite
as
funky
with
the
yeast
as
i
like
in
this
style
but
its
well
balanced
and
also
very
clean
taste
is
balanced
smooth
highly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
too
i
am
using
that
adjective
a
lot
in
this
review
but
this
is
quite
simply
a
super
clean
beer
good
value
too
easy
call
to
buy
frequently
its
a
classic
of
the
style
overall
very
good
beer
would
definately
recommend
it
to
a
friend
or
stranger
slightly
on
the
expensive
side12
60
for
a
6
pack
but
the
flavor
is
worth
it
warning
though
if
you
are
a
fan
of
normal
pilsners
you
may
not
like
it
because
of
its
aforementioned
bock
taste
overall
not
recommended
leaves
a
bit
of
dryness
and
bitterness
but
which
i
like
but
there
is
too
much
negative
for
me
in
the
nose
and
the
style
is
not
very
ambitious
or
good
while
this
has
a
crisp
golden
bronze
color
it
had
basically
no
head
but
the
aroma
is
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
nice
bread
like
character
to
it
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
crisp
and
clean
and
again
rather
like
raw
bread
dough
in
flavor
i
will
say
i
like
the
fact
that
it
had
a
bit
of
an
effervescent
quality
to
it
d
a
solid
pilsner
here
just
be
careful
not
to
get
it
skunked
when
its
at
its
peak
its
a
nice
little
beer
pours
a
superclear
golden
yellow
a
white
head
laces
the
glass
smell
is
very
minerally
some
biscuity
malt
and
a
faint
bitterness
taste
is
way
more
round
than
the
smell
a
fair
amount
of
estery
back
end
and
a
nice
mellow
hop
finish
super
smooth
feel
with
some
zest
at
the
end
easy
to
drink

fine
pilsner
here

i
poured
the
half
liter
bottle
into
a
stella
artois
glass
the
beer
poured
a
nice
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
lacing
for
a
head
plenty
of
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
with
a
buttery
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
mellow
a
goes
down
smoothly
a
great
sipping
beer
and
even
better
for
long
sessions
pourd
a
5l
can
into
my
mug
appeared
gold
not
entirely
clear
with
a
short
head
the
bitterness
is
right
in
line
with
the
style
with
a
rounded
herbal
hop
finish
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
a
touch
ciderlike
at
first
but
the
spicy
dry
lemony
hops
quickly
take
over
not
a
bad
lager
to
session
d
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
tasty
euro
lager
that
would
bode
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
flavours
are
mild
but
i
would
definitely
prefer
this
over
some
of
the
canadian
large
scale
brews
the
beer
has
a
decent
grain
bill
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
cereal
malts
and
some
light
hops
giving
a
bit
of
bitters
character
overall
a
pretty
smooth
product
easily
consumed
with
a
nice
straightforward
label
and
well
rounded
flavor
profile
probably
would
pair
well
with
a
roast
pheasant
dinner
d
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
is
always
supposed
to
be
skunky
like
this
or
not
but
the
skunkiness
overpowered
the
aroma
and
taste
to
the
point
that
it
was
difficult
to
pick
them
out
d
very
nice
import
pilsner
fine
session
beer
not
phenomenal
but
worth
trying
just
wanted
to
try
something
different
this
was
an
impulse
beer
buy
d
not
bad
not
great
would
like
to
try
this
fresher
though
d
a
good
czech
pilsner
though
not
necessarily
standout
in
the
style
for
style
i
cant
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
the
tastes
are
just
a
bit
off
for
me
more
crispness
and
hop
character
would
have
been
welcomed
and
the
flavor
profile
is
a
little
odd
d
very
typical
of
a
czech
style
pilsner
and
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
beening
said
for
a
beer
i
have
to
search
all
over
and
fear
to
find
fresh
at
its
price
id
rather
buy
somthing
locally
and
just
as
good
a
great
beer
but
the
availability
takes
away
from
it
overall
this
is
a
simple
and
refreshing
beer
although
expensive
it
is
worth
drinking
all
night
drinkability
nice
tasting
beer
that
i
will
stock
again
overall
impressed
with
character
this
beer
brings
to
the
table
this
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
but
eventually
vanishes
the
aroma
is
of
faint
noble
hops
and
a
little
skunk
the
taste
has
some
nice
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
unlike
the
aroma
there
is
no
skunkiness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
doubt
ill
drink
it
again
i
did
not
get
any
floaties
and
the
head
was
bone
white
an
all
round
excellent
pilsner
rjt
d
this
is
flavorful
yet
different
but
has
the
overall
profile
of
a
czech
pils
its
fuller
but
refreshing
and
i
wish
this
was
available
on
tap
at
any
of
the
local
pubs
it
would
be
a
great
choice
i
would
have
no
problems
having
an
evening
full
of
this
brew
i
like
it
and
recommend
it
d
good
beer
easy
to
drink
only
this
in
a
sitting
drink
an
excellent
euro
lager
probably
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
the
category
id
compare
this
with
pilsner
urquell
a
definite
session
beer
hops
are
more
on
the
woodperfume
side
than
the
grassspice
not
hopped
up
to
budvar
but
a
good
clean
czech
pilsener
drinkability
not
a
gamechanger
by
any
stretch
but
i
found
it
to
be
pleasant
enough
its
more
or
less
on
par
with
the
rest
of
europes
macro
lagers
such
as
carlsberg
or
stella
artois
overall
if
youve
tried
other
czech
pilseners
this
is
worth
trying
my
pour
got
me
two
fingers
worth
of
fluffy
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
pretty
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
liquid
sunshine
nose
had
a
rich
saazhop
grassiness
up
front
with
an
underlying
lager
sweetness
in
a
can
i
have
been
missing
out
with
all
of
the
aals
that
have
been
part
of
this
process
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
had
a
pronounced
molasses
flavor
on
the
tongue
wild
finish
was
slightly
grassy
and
bitter
but
lingering
with
a
molasses
tang
i
have
this
as
a
gots
but
if
i
do
not
get
any
takers
it
will
be
going
into
my
cooler
nice
a
slovak
quasitallboy
doesnt
get
much
better
than
that
right
oh
wait
it
does
johnny
cashs
hurt
now
fills
the
air
about
me
right
on
this
bad
boy
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
quicktodeath
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
puffed
rice
and
a
field
full
o
fragrant
flowers
the
taste
rocks
all
o
these
elements
adding
a
slight
cornsyrupesque
sweetness
in
the
back
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
pils
i
may
not
be
that
big
a
fan
o
this
style
but
this
is
pretty
good
i
like
this
beer
poured
from
tap
to
a
05l
zwayt
bazant
glass
by
the
time
the
beer
got
to
me
there
was
no
head
so
i
imagine
it
fell
fast
to
the
thin
white
film
left
before
me
a
clear
golden
body
was
shown
with
a
good
amount
of
activity
smells
faintly
of
malt
and
hops
theres
a
sweetness
like
honey
in
the
beer
very
malty
and
a
bit
filling
with
slight
hop
taste
as
well
i
really
like
the
beer
though
slightly
filling
id
happily
make
a
few
of
these
my
meal
overall
a
good
drinker
not
a
hint
of
skunk
even
from
the
green
bottle
i
liked
this
as
a
rep
of
the
style
pleasant
and
enough
uniqueness
to
edge
this
up
worth
a
try
this
actually
surprised
me
i
have
to
admit
from
the
packagingstyle
and
smell
i
did
not
expect
to
like
this
one
oddly
enough
though
i
find
it
quite
drinkable
and
will
look
forward
to
having
it
again
to
many
golden
pheasant
may
be
just
another
mild
mainstream
lager
and
it
is
but
it
bears
noting
that
these
kinds
of
beers
are
so
often
emasculated
and
corrupted
with
adjuncts
that
to
brew
an
unadulterated
and
relatively
uncompromising
example
is
respectable
and
virtuous
in
its
own
right
dont
be
so
quick
to
call
this
one
for
the
birds
the
body
was
fairly
typical
for
the
style
as
was
drinkability
overall
except
for
the
skunk
this
was
a
decent
litle
example
of
the
style
id
like
to
try
a
nonskunked
one
sometime
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
the
touch
of
malt
in
the
nose
which
inevitably
reminds
the
czech
lager
is
pleasant
the
body
is
fairly
light
but
complex
flavors
but
it
offers
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
to
bring
the
drink
and
making
it
very
pleasant
to
drink
the
finish
is
not
powerful
just
a
slight
grassy
bitterness
probably
due
to
the
saaz
hops
where
the
side
joins
the
malt
side
more
invigorating
hops
overall
much
better
than
expected
and
i
will
admit
putting
this
one
off
for
quite
sometime
this
beer
has
alot
of
character
for
the
style
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
for
anyone
who
enjoys
a
tasty
pils
i
had
a
few
of
these
on
my
trip
and
it
was
never
really
disappointing
if
you
like
a
good
czech
pils
this
would
be
the
beer
for
you
i
really
like
the
taste
of
it
its
a
little
expensive
and
it
is
not
easy
to
find
most
stores
dont
have
it
d
drinks
quite
nicely
d
i
think
the
pint
0
9
ounce
serving
is
perfect
for
this
very
strong
flavor
and
big
body
but
still
very
drinkable
cheers
a
decent
beer
and
worth
trying
those
slovaks
know
how
to
make
a
decent
lager
d
another
fine
czech
pilsener
checks
all
the
boxes
and
refreshes
the
drinker
no
complaints
here
very
good
beer
clean
and
refreshing
the
czechs
and
slovaks
know
how
to
brew
like
this
a
little
better
than
budvar
maybe
not
quite
as
much
as
urquell
will
definitely
drink
again
will
search
to
find
this
on
tap
will
also
try
in
the
can
if
it
available
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
ive
always
seen
in
the
stores
and
wanted
to
give
it
a
shot
so
i
picked
one
up
last
night
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pilsner
urquell
stemmed
glass
bright
yellow
color
decent
sized
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
a
good
amount
of
lacing
also
then
you
notice
that
skunky
lightstruck
green
bottle
smell
never
pleasant
but
expected
taste
was
pretty
average
for
a
pils
clean
and
nondescript
mouthfeel
was
good
it
went
down
fairly
easily
beer
seemed
to
lose
that
skunky
smell
ever
so
slightly
as
it
warmed
up
to
room
temp
its
a
decent
pilsner
but
i
bet
it
would
be
better
on
tap
this
has
a
nice
dryness
that
is
very
but
is
also
a
bit
sweet
i
get
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
as
well
pours
pale
golden
with
medium
sized
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
rim
and
leaves
plenty
of
lace
nose
is
clean
with
a
whiff
of
fresh
white
bread
aroma
palate
is
also
somewhat
clean
with
a
subdued
malt
sweetness
and
crisp
hop
balance
very
approachable
and
easy
drinking
again
with
the
green
bottle
i
was
hesitant
but
it
didnt
taste
skunky
at
all
a
decent
session
beer
but
i
am
sure
the
slovaks
have
better
ones
they
keep
home
a
very
good
pilsner
crisp
and
fresh
i
think
i
must
have
opened
a
very
fresh
bottle
as
it
is
better
than
other
bottles
that
ive
had
in
the
past
green
bottle
twistoff
from
the
slovak
republic
and
of
course
the
jipped
me
of
8
of
an
ounce
of
beer
its
an
11
2
ounce
bottle
tarnished
brass
color
and
a
modest
creamy
white
head
good
clarity
and
few
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
of
the
glass
smells
like
good
quality
ingredients
were
used
to
brew
this
beer
smells
like
sweet
malted
barley
smells
just
as
the
best
german
lagers
that
abide
by
the
purity
law
smell
light
and
flavorful
sweet
carmely
malt
taste
good
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
in
the
aftertaste
excellent
beer
perfect
example
of
a
czech
pilsner
this
is
what
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
the
taste
for
this
style
can
not
be
improved
upon
a
fresh
tasting
pils
that
resembles
both
in
design
and
taste
pilsner
urquel
i
liked
the
clean
taste
of
the
finish
and
decent
hopping
level
of
this
beer
put
it
in
tall
boy
cans
ands
i
would
buy
it
again
most
euro
pils
come
in
cans
in
bc
not
a
world
beater
but
a
quality
lager
that
does
slovenia
proud
taste
is
a
little
flat
after
the
hop
zest
aroma
got
my
hopes
up
might
enjoy
this
more
next
time
if
its
sampled
in
the
summer
i
could
see
this
enjoyable
in
a
more
appopriate
season
its
got
the
lemon
tang
and
whatnot
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
but
nothing
particularly
noteworthy
either
overall
decent
beer
best
of
luck
with
your
beers
cheers
mouthfeel
was
ok
about
the
same
as
urquell
not
a
bad
little
pilsner
quite
drinkable
for
the
price
it
aint
bad
theres
others
i
prefer
but
every
once
in
a
while
ill
give
this
slovak
option
its
due
not
my
favorite
pilsener
but
its
alright
drinkability
this
isnt
bad
on
its
own
it
might
be
a
little
rough
for
me
but
it
goes
really
well
with
food
i
could
get
this
again
if
im
in
the
right
mood
pours
a
clear
golden
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
metallic
yeast
sulfur
and
euro
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
czech
pilsener
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
supfur
yeast
euro
pale
malt
and
slight
grain
overall
an
obvisously
lightstruck
beer
at
least
i
strongly
hope
so
bought
this
because
i
liked
the
label
very
glad
i
did
nice
and
bright
golden
color
with
plenty
of
rather
large
bubbles
streaming
from
the
bottomcenter
of
my
glass
a
typically
loose
and
fizzy
white
head
with
a
brief
but
happy
life
releases
a
nice
aroma
of
flowers
lemons
and
honey
clean
taste
and
light
body
make
this
very
enjoyable
again
lots
of
flowers
and
honey
with
citrus
in
the
taste
and
a
lightly
spiced
hoppy
sting
at
the
end
the
bubbles
left
little
pinpricks
in
my
mouth
nice
very
much
worth
your
while
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
and
its
worth
drinking
for
a
while
if
your
choices
are
limited
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
d
excellent
flavorful
and
refreshing
definitely
have
another
drinkability
is
average
clean
and
crackery
on
the
tongue
crisp
and
dry
at
first
a
touch
of
bready
malt
briefly
appears
midpalate
before
the
floral
herbal
hop
character
takes
over
in
the
finish
restrained
bitterness
and
i
must
emphasize
how
remarkably
clean
this
is
incredibly
quaffable
stuff
yet
subtly
complex
one
of
the
better
czechstyle
pilsners
ive
had
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
while
it
is
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
it
definately
makes
my
mouth
happy
very
drinkable
taste
follows
with
a
lightly
sweet
orange
malt
flavor
that
offers
a
lingering
carbonation
on
the
tongue
and
a
hint
of
peppery
spice
body
increases
over
time
however
as
the
carbonation
shrinks
somewhat
quickly
this
leaves
a
finish
that
becomes
richer
with
malt
flavors
though
it
does
refresh
nicely
with
a
topping
off
overall
pretty
good
but
slightly
heavy
on
the
finish
its
not
a
bad
lager
overall
it
doesnt
have
the
character
of
a
good
pilsener
which
is
a
shame
but
it
does
end
up
a
fresh
clean
and
easydrinking
beer
all
the
same
im
not
wowed
but
im
not
repulsed
either
conclusion
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
with
a
nice
sizzling
texture
across
the
tongue
perfectly
crisp
and
lagery
its
a
decent
pils
but
not
a
fantastic
one
more
hopping
to
eliminate
that
weird
sweet
peak
and
bitter
up
the
finish
would
be
more
than
welcome
drinkability
this
has
a
nice
drinkability
much
like
most
lagers
golden
pheasant
is
a
slovakia
pilsner
and
an
overall
good
example
of
a
pilsner
it
is
easy
to
drink
my
golden
pheasant
was
serves
in
a
tall
slender
golden
pheasant
mug
dont
you
love
proper
glassware
filled
to
the
500
ml
mark
it
is
aggressively
carbonated
but
did
not
form
a
persistant
head
easy
to
drink
interesting
malt
character
for
a
pilsner
you
can
taste
some
hop
flavors
too
overall
an
excellent
drinkable
wet
beer
i
order
it
frequently
and
enjoy
it
everytime
better
on
draught
than
in
bottles
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
has
a
mild
hoppy
aroma
taste
is
crisp
with
some
malt
and
hoppiness
feels
a
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
goes
down
very
smooth
and
easy
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
d
i
didnt
find
anything
all
that
special
about
this
still
its
fairly
well
done
and
a
fine
session
brew
definitely
a
solid
pilsner
even
if
it
doesnt
quite
compete
with
some
of
the
czech
offerings
well
not
better
or
worse
than
any
of
the
swedish
macro
lagers
an
unnecessary
import
d
not
the
best
pilsener
ive
had
to
my
taste
it
lacks
some
hops
but
in
the
summertime
its
a
great
thirstquencher
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
a
nice
clear
yellow
head
with
a
fresh
carbonated
head
that
retains
with
nice
lacing
til
the
end
the
smell
is
crisp
with
noble
hops
and
malt
and
biscuits
the
taste
is
a
bit
thin
but
it
is
a
easy
drinking
pils
with
a
crisp
noble
hop
flavor
it
finishes
with
some
sweet
malts
the
mouth
feel
is
crisp
an
you
can
drink
these
all
day
long
a
nice
summer
cookout
pils
or
lawnmower
beer
try
this
one
its
pretty
good
recommended
for
sure
for
the
summer
season
the
taste
gets
a
bit
thin
and
watery
as
the
beer
settles
right
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
was
quite
crisp
had
a
sharp
little
hop
spicy
bite
some
definite
graininess
husk
flavors
and
grassiness
the
beer
is
settling
in
and
it
is
getting
smoother
sweeter
a
little
less
spicy
and
less
interesting
the
beer
had
a
certain
crisp
refreshing
taste
and
has
evaporated
and
im
getting
too
much
bland
watery
sweet
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
drinkability
is
good
with
flavor
and
as
light
as
this
beer
is
thus
drinkable
enjoyable
bt
not
memorable
a
decent
example
of
a
veritable
czech
pilsener
from
their
former
admittedly
throwntogether
countrymen
with
the
normal
amount
of
offflavours
likely
due
to
the
stupid
green
bottle
i
can
see
you
under
there
my
friend
too
bad
about
that
other
stuff
eh
i
just
picked
up
this
beer
today
just
finished
it
not
too
bad
it
was
not
too
impressive
pouring
it
but
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tastey
beer
would
like
to
see
what
else
they
put
out
it
is
also
my
first
slovak
beer
overall
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
this
again
perhaps
with
a
good
hearty
meal
drinkability
a
very
good
session
beer
and
my
favorite
czech
pilsner
so
far
of
which
i
have
had
many
during
my
time
so
far
in
slovakia
i
do
not
let
this
affect
my
review
because
that
would
be
unfair
but
i
would
still
like
to
note
that
this
beer
improves
by
leaps
and
bounds
on
tap
the
taste
delivers
on
the
flavor
i
remember
with
some
biscuit
inspired
malt
balanced
nicely
with
the
saaz
or
hallertau
or
whatever
bitter
european
hops
theyre
going
with
the
aftertaste
is
pleasing
and
slightly
warming
a
solid
example
of
central
european
craftsmanship
in
their
signature
style
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
a
good
bit
of
flavor
in
this
beer
it
was
definitely
the
best
of
the
round
d
the
quality
as
well
as
tradition
is
evident
makes
a
good
refreshment
and
does
not
leave
you
thirsty
drinkability
pretty
solid
beer
a
good
representation
of
the
pilsner
style
highly
recommended
there
was
no
date
on
the
bottle
sorry
however
there
was
a
code
of
some
sorts
like
a
bottle
cap
but
im
not
sure
what
that
meant
maybe
i
won
a
hat
mouthfeel
was
zippy
and
medium
bodied
this
poured
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
a
thin
film
along
the
top
aroma
was
very
nice
without
a
trace
of
skunkiness
to
it
very
crisp
very
clean
a
very
well
done
czech
pilsener
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
sky
high
i
will
definitely
have
again
it
pours
out
a
nice
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
rather
thick
slightly
offwhite
head
the
head
stays
for
a
bit
a
point
in
this
beers
favor
crisp
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
has
a
fruity
hint
flavor
is
crisp
and
has
a
surprisingly
strong
bitter
bite
as
well
as
just
a
hint
of
sweet
fruit
texture
is
smooth
and
tingly
and
aftertaste
is
somewhat
bitter
but
not
nastily
so
one
of
the
better
pilsners
i
have
sampled
alright
i
finally
got
my
hands
on
this
one
so
onto
to
the
review
this
is
a
very
well
done
czech
pils
the
hop
bitterness
on
this
is
definatly
toned
down
when
compared
to
pilsner
uruquell
my
benchmark
for
this
style
but
none
the
less
this
is
a
terrific
beer
pours
out
a
deep
golden
yellow
color
that
is
nice
and
rich
with
a
small
ring
of
laceing
that
holds
pretty
nice
smell
was
a
bit
skunky
so
i
docked
it
5
but
otherwise
floral
hops
and
beery
smell
decent
pheasant
goes
down
smooth
with
a
nice
smoothness
and
the
perfect
carbonation
first
you
feel
the
carbonation
then
the
hops
finish
crisp
and
clean
no
aftertaste
i
would
of
given
it
a
4
5
but
i
really
like
a
lingering
hop
flavor
in
a
nice
czech
pils
but
this
didnt
so
it
gets
a
4
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
feels
like
velvet
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
amazing
with
this
one
when
you
want
a
beer
with
taste
and
something
that
is
refreshing
at
the
same
time
and
will
satisfy
you
after
your
done
and
you
can
session
it
all
night
long
this
is
your
beer
this
is
very
good
beer
and
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
and
what
i
had
been
told
by
friends
well
done
highly
recommended
pours
a
dark
gold
with
a
twofinger
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
and
decent
amount
of
bubbling
from
the
carbonation
smells
strongly
of
pilsener
malts
sweet
grass
and
light
floral
hoppiness
no
skunking
whatsoever
taste
is
similar
in
that
the
malt
is
dominantgrain
is
really
the
best
way
to
describe
it
the
light
sweetness
is
balanced
by
a
clean
slightly
bitter
finish
nice
thick
feel
for
what
it
is
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
from
a
beer
for
which
i
had
low
expectations
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
bright
wheat
color
with
a
12
clean
white
head
the
head
settles
very
quickly
into
a
thin
cap
leaving
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
dry
hops
clean
malt
with
a
wonderful
balance
and
a
crisp
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
moderate
but
tingles
in
the
throat
this
is
a
solid
czech
pilsener
coming
from
a
place
where
beer
is
simply
beer
d
not
bad
i
dont
like
the
focus
on
the
pepper
notes
but
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
and
it
might
go
well
with
something
that
compliments
pepper
like
maybe
a
ham
sammich
d
this
is
a
decent
pils
nothing
overwhelmingly
special
but
not
bad
either
i
have
had
pilsner
urquell
but
no
other
czechslovak
brews
czechvar
is
on
my
radar
very
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
crisp
feel
and
nice
carbonation
no
outstanding
taste
a
good
thirst
quenching
brew
very
tasty
balanced
and
drinkable
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
lot
of
honey
herb
some
apple
a
little
toasty
bread
that
becomes
more
prominent
near
the
finish
it
has
a
nice
very
czech
feel
oily
yet
spritzyzesty
but
is
not
as
oily
as
some
it
starts
off
lightly
sweet
but
this
is
increasingly
balanced
by
a
light
herballemon
bitterness
that
just
barely
takes
over
in
the
very
end
of
the
finish
its
flavours
are
fullbodied
and
solid
and
it
has
great
interplay
of
textures
flavours
sweetness
and
bitterness
a
nice
constant
balancing
act
in
the
mouth
the
flavors
are
clean
but
subdued
nothing
big
or
unique
pheasant
has
a
crisp
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
nothing
that
stands
out
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
refreshing
but
is
just
teetering
on
the
positive
side
golden
pheasant
poured
a
nice
golden
color
however
it
had
only
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
at
all
smell
was
full
of
strong
hops
followed
by
a
light
malty
sweetness
taste
was
crisp
malty
sweet
up
front
and
followed
by
a
slight
hop
finish
mouthfeel
seemed
ok
for
a
pils
drinkability
was
very
good
overall
this
beer
is
exactly
what
it
should
be
a
pils
with
some
good
flavors
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
buy
it
again
its
not
quite
stella
artois
but
it
is
from
slovakia
so
i
say
give
it
a
try
and
gain
bragging
rights
for
your
extensive
knowledge
of
slavic
beers
how
many
other
ones
can
there
be
drinkability
easy
to
down
sure
and
it
does
so
without
becoming
to
bland
but
on
the
other
hand
never
really
strikes
me
as
something
one
would
truly
long
for
either
d
easy
to
pound
this
beer
back
a
decent
sessionable
beer
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
the
average
bud
drinker
d
this
is
quite
a
nice
pilsner
and
definitely
worth
a
try
however
the
flavors
are
so
delicate
here
that
having
this
after
any
strong
flavored
beers
would
be
a
mistake
to
appreciate
it
fully
bottle
poured
into
chalice
thin
head
a
tad
soapy
in
some
areas
a
bit
hazy
golden
thatch
in
color
smell
fairly
clean
grain
some
malt
taste
surprisingly
malty
for
a
pilsener
hoppy
aftertaste
mf
a
touch
creamy
but
pretty
average
body
nicley
carbed
very
drinkable
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
czech
pilsener
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
with
some
salty
snacks
watching
a
ball
game
i
loved
in
czech
for
6
months
and
this
was
the
most
served
slovak
beer
great
example
of
a
fine
pilsner
like
may
beers
in
the
area
it
is
smooth
very
drinkable
and
has
little
aftertaste
the
translation
for
the
beer
is
zlaty
basant
even
though
i
liked
it
there
are
betetr
choices
from
the
of
the
month
selection
didnt
think
much
of
it
at
first
though
the
label
and
cap
band
is
a
nice
touch
poured
yellow
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
bubbly
clear
look
and
a
head
that
seemed
to
dissipate
quickly
grassy
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
was
surprisngly
balanced
and
refreshing
nice
rounded
even
a
touch
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
fruity
hops
presence
that
is
both
refreshing

drinkability
wise
and
avoid
at

a
heneiken
by

still
drinks
the

and
wouldnt
taint
my
toilet
water
with
this
ps
i
was
under
the
impression
heneiken
owned
and
operated
this
d
an
easy
drinking
pilsner
that
goes
down
like
water
but
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
more
than
one
because
halfway
through
the
bottle
i
am
already
bored
with
it
not
much
complexity
to
this
simple
and
light
lager
long
live
the
bohemians
pilseners
are
one
of
my
favorite
style
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
czech
pilsener
in
my
opinion
only
price
would
keep
it
from
being
a
regular
drink
not
bad
at
all
bland
watery
mouthfeel
but
overall
a
good
beer

tried
this
again
and
im
upping
the
mouthfeel
score
as
its
a
lot
better
than
that
crisp
yet
full
in
the
sense
that
it
brings
to
mind
some
pils
that
were

with
good
carbonation

a
tasty

thats
got
a
gorgeous

very

one
of
my
favorite
european
pilsners
poured
with

with
the
bitter

beats
the
crap
out

just
about
all
the

out
there
in

of

this
beer
wont
wow
you

if
youre
the
type
who
lets
a
little
skunkiness
ruin
the
drinking
experience
then
this
isnt
for
you
but
it
tastes
good
is
quite
refreshing
and
would
pair
well
with
just
about
any
meal
if
available
its
a
better
choice
than
the
more
expensive
pilsner
urquell
the
smell
was
a
bit
skunky
but
nothing
to
be
upset
about
overall
the

i
will
definitely
drink
another
one
of
these
in

100th
review
of
this
beer
cheers
golden
pheasant
isnt
anything
too
exciting
but
its
a
pleasant
drinker
particularly
on
hot
days
that
comes
at
a
good
price
and
will
not
leave
you
wishing
youd
bought
something
else
very
minor
foggy
tone
to
a
straw
color
crème
head
minor
cereal
nose
with
a
stronger
metallic
tone
flavor
is
tart
in
a
way
i
dont
consider
positive
metallic
edge
is
there
but
not
the
biggest
character
of
the
ride
feel
is
typical
overall
this
is
average
stuff
there
is
nothing
interesting
about
it
and
the
metallic
and
dirty
edge
just
kind
of
kills
it
from
ever
being
interesting
d
a
very
average
flavored
lager
almost
smooth
taste
w
subtle
european
yeast
qualities
and
slightly
mineral
malt
flavor
an
ok
lager
but
one
is
enough
for
me
havent
had
a
lager
in
months
a
pils
in
even
longer
minimal
head
and
lace
even
with
the
most
vigorus
pour
clear
faint
yellow
skunk
aroma
but
plesant
classic
saaz
hop
pils
but
very
refreshing
some
bitternessmetallic
as
palate
goes
along
enjoyable
lager
as
lagers
go
with
me
anyways
the
taste
totally
reminds
me
of
a
stella
perhaps
a
little
drier
and
more
bitter
the
bitterness
is
complimented
nicely
by
the
taste
of
sweet
malt
i
feel
as
though
this
is
a
cross
between
a
stella
and
a
victory
lager
this
beer
would
be
a
great
thirst
quencher
for
a
nice
summer
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
something
a
very
drinkable
beer
thats
worth
a
try
but
i
think
you
can
get
a
slighty
better
experience
from
stella
artois
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
simple
pilsener
pours
golden
with
an
okay
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
cap
the
smell
is
lightly
grainy
clean
has
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
lager
yeast
not
bad
taste
is
similar
quite
clean
with
a
crisp
pilsner
mouthfeel
slightly
soft
and
with
noticeable
floral
hops
not
as
robust
as
most
czech
pilsners
but
this
slovak
version
is
pleasant
enough
in
its
own
way
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
gold
colour
darker
than
most
north
american
lagers
the
head
was
quite
large
and
quite
dense
but
disappeared
quickly
leaving
a
little
lacing
on
the
side
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
some
yeasty
tinges
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
ample
carbonation
and
mediumbodied
the
taste
is
very
much
pilsener
like
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
common
czech
pilseners
in
my
opinion
poured
from
the
500ml
green
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
bright
golden
color
in
the
body
topped
by
a
smallish
creamy
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
very
long
aroma
of
sweet
lightly
bread
pilsner
malt
a
touch
of
spicy
saaz
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
skunk
palate
is
a
nice
balance
between
light
pilsner
malt
and
tangy
hops
with
a
lingering
bitterness
body
is
nice
and
wellcarbonated
but
a
strange
antiseptic
tinge
emerges
on
the
finish

decent
thirstquenching

the

by
a
nice

a
nice

overall
this
is
a
highly

brew
that
i
will
surely

in

recommended
a

i
dont
care
for
this

drinks
easy

a

although
i
do

than

urquell

nothing

at
all

clean
and
crisp
and
very
pleasant
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
taste
also
had
a
hint
of
alcohol
when
first
poured
but
again
that
changed
with
warming
some
hop
bitterness
coming
through
but
not
much
noble
hop
flavor
that
usually
accompanies
the
style
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
an
afternoon
but
its
flavor
is
pretty
basic
it
drinks
smooth
and
doesnt
leave
a
whole
lot
of
aftertaste
not
bad
decent
but
basic
all
the
pieces
are
in
place
probably
great
with
food
on
a
hot
thirsty
day
a
pretty
good
if
simple
pilsner
definately
fits
the
style

i
feel
it
could
use

a

ml

with
a
foiled
neck
and

the
smell
is
a
little
skunky
at
first
but
that
cleared
up
by
breathing
for
a
few
minutes
a
mild
hop
aroma
dominated
after
the
skunk
cleared
the
flavor
is
mild
not
unpleasant
but
not
exciting
either
fairly
well
balanced
its
hard
to
pick
out
any
flavors
better
than
a
lot
of
eastern
european
lagers
ive
had
its
a
solid
choice
when
looking
for
this
style
and
above
average
for
european
pilseners
for
the
past
few
years
ive
been
getting
this
occasionally
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
czechstyle
pilsener
and
its
never
been
a
disappointment
never
been
harsh
metallic
or
skunked
i
may
have
golden
pheasant
again
but
i
dont
think
that
it
will
ever
be
a
mainstay
in
my
beer
diet
a
fairly
straightforward
pilsner
worth
a
shot
guess
its
ok
stuck
in
the
czech
pilsner
sytle
i
would
have
said
euro
pilsner
because
of
the
earthy
character
with
a
noticable
but
mild
skunk
aroma
disguised
neatly
as
herbal
and
mustey
hops
the
beer
comes
across
characterful
but
dirty
a
common
light
yellow
and
neatly
clear
hue
with
adequate
carbonation
and
a
lacking
head
retention
moderate
malt
sweetness
with
a
grain
quality
expected
hoppy
for
sure
but
more
earthy
flavors
than
balancing
bitterness
feels
typically
grainey
carbonated
and
clean
but
just
slight
of
refreshing
and
crisp
just
a
little
to
muddy
with
the
hops
never
really
got
over
the
pungent
aroma
and
flavor
md
smooth
and
semiclean
not
crisp
on
the
texture
pleasant
enough
for
quaffing
in
quantity
yet
the
flavour
profile
is
slightly
too
boring
as
the
hoppy
entry
only
brings
aboard
its
body
rather
than
sufficient
flavours
hence
a
beer
feeling
better
in
the
end
than
its
overall
taste
an
o
k
pilsnerstyle
lager
i
have
to
sayneeds
more
flavours
would
be
highly
refreshing
if
chilled
on
a
hot
day
enjoyable
very
good
beer
certainly
the
best
from
slovakia
d
easy
enough
to
drink
not
particularly
interesting
or
tasty
but
not
bad
either
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
spot
this
one
out
of
a
lineup
of
pale
euros
and
pils
i
will
attempt
to
find
another
bottle
and
rereview
not
much
of
a
nose
but
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
beads
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
in
that
respect
not
acidic
however
not
much
flavour
as
the
farmer
said
thatll
do
babe
thatll
do
but
not
much
more
take
it
when
its
offered
but
dont
seek
it
out
this
poured
a
standard
pilsner
look
a
yelloworange
look
with
some
slight
lacing
smell
is
actually
really
good
for
coming
from
a
green
bottle
not
a
single
bit
of
skunk
in
the
nose
taste
is
pretty
good
fresh
grain
with
strong
bitter
hoppy
undertones
that
fade
quickly
this
is
not
overly
carbonated
which
makes
it
a
pretty
positive
drinking
experience
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
id
have
another
if
offered
would
go
well
with
spicy
food
not
so
bad
these
questions
and
more
will
be
answered
never
or
will
they
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
moderate
white
puffy
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
glass
smell
is
a
citrus
and
hoppy
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
finished
more
bitter
that
malty
with
a
touch
of
citrus
a
simple
yet
refreshing
beer

2
oz
d
this
is
a
better
pils
than
a
skunky
heineken
all
the
way
around
pilsners
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
once
in
a
while
ill
enjoy
one
id
drink
this
again
in
a
pinch
i
remember
while
living
in
hong
kong
someone
visiting
had
the
kindness
to
bring
me
a
bottle
of
this
and
i
truly
enjoyed
it
id
drink
it
again
overall
was
ok
for
a
sample
but
i
will
not
return
for
more
decent
light
copper
in
colour
and
well
carbonated
saaz
hop
type
aromas
are
dominant
with
some
light
honeylike
malt
playing
a
minor
role
the
body
is
somewhat
thin
and
watery
but
the
flavors
are
alright
with
notes
of
grassy
hops
minerals
and
light
malt
not
quite
bitter
enough
for
my
taste
and
a
little
on
the
simple
side
but
not
too
bad
at
all
it
compared
favorably
to
the
urquell
i
had
afterwards
to
those
days
when
we
were
young
and
the
birds
were
thick
in
the
cornfields
of
iowa
carpe
pheasant
seize
the
bird
its
pretty
easydrinking
stuff
but
i
prefer
topvar
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
herbish
green
noble
hops
and
complimented
by
a
simple
pilsner
malt
flavor
nothing
fancy
but
more
generous
in
flavor
than
a
typical
american
pils
color
is
golden
yellow
with
below
average
head
size
after
a
tiny
initial
whiff
of
skunk
the
aroma
is
of
doughy
malts
with
an
underlying
herbal
hop
smell
taste
is
mainly
of
malts
not
too
sweet
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
taste
is
probably
more
like
a
euro
pale
lager
than
a
czech
pils
mouthfeel
has
an
above
average
crispness
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
impression
a
decent
pilsner
nothing
outstanding
it
is
being
marketed
by
heineken
as
an
ultrapremium
and
the
price
tag
reflects
that
this
one
was
left
over
from
a
party
and
i
wont
be
seeking
out
more
golden
pheasant
is
pleasant
enough
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
balanced
dont
want
to
think
too
much
about
it
kind
of
pilsener
brewed
in
the
slovak
republic
and
who
isnt
this
just
might
be
your
beer

more
toward

with

not

either
i
dont
claim
to
know
a

about

i
like
this
brew
it
would
certainly
fit
in
as
a
session
beer
djust
average
or
worse
there
are
many
examples
of
this

that
are
better

in

smell

more

taste

i
would
classified
this
as
a
better
then
average
pilsner
without
any
watery
taste
and
no
skunk
taste
from
the
bottle
which
are
two
major
accomplishments

mouth
this
brew
isnt
horrible
but
i
cant
see
a
repeat
purchase
came
in
a
green
500
ml
bottle
gold
foil
around
the
neck
and
cap
small
pheasant
logo
embossed
around
the
shoulder
a
classy
enough
presentation
pours
out
a
deep
clear
gold
thick
foamy
white
head
with
good
retention
sweet
malt
blended
with
crisp
grain
on
the
nose
along
with
grassy
hops
this
is
an
okay
enough
tasting
pilsener
there
are
no
serious
defects
but
there
is
not
much
character
to
it
either
to
make
it
stand
out
husky
grains
at
first
mellowing
out
in
the
middle
with
a
brisk
herbal
hoppy
finish
quite
a
bite
on
the
aftertaste
as
well
the
mouthfeel
starts
crisp
but
becomes
a
bit
abrasive
throughout
after
that
the
palate
and
throat
feels
rubbed
raw
after
swallowing
very
akin
to
sandpaper
nice
looking
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
pick
up
another
for
casual
drinking
ill
be
passing
on
this
next
time
i
come
across
it
it
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
doughy
malts
and
a
fresh
mown
hay
grassy
hop
character
the
taste
is
some
what
watery
with
a
malty
beginning
and
a
more
hoppy
well
rounded
middle
the
finish
is
a
little
slender
with
moderate
bitterness
this
beer
is
a
lot
more
characterful
than
maintstream
imports
like
heinekin
grolsch
and
becks
this
is
probably
a
bad
bottle
but
it
smells
like
a
disturbed
skunk
on
a
hot
summer
night
and
the
flavor
while
not
skunky
is
not
winning
me
over
either
i
have
tried
other
czech
pilsners
and
they
were
nothing
like
this
beer
oh
the
tragedy
that
i
spent
money
on
this
beer
i
hope
my
liver
and
palate
forgive
me
light
crisp
and
actually
quite
refreshing
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
a
good
beer
either
drinkability
is
decent
but
not
outstanding
just
above
average
for
style
and
certainly
worth
a
try
darker
yellow
and
transparent
hugebubbled
head
that
has
no
chance
of
lasting
past
a
quick
photo
shoot
and
it
doesnt
laces
in
thin
tendrils
sugary
look
to
them
grassy
aroma
light
bit
of
white
pepper
flavor
is
skewed
in
the
malty
direction
smooth
and
suggestive
of
light
brown
sugar
with
some
slippery
graininess
that
approaches
wheat
starch
in
flavor
arid
hops
dried
autumn
leaves
and
a
little
underwhelming
in
balancing
the
first
impression
not
fizzy
superior
to
some
massmarket
lagers
in
that
sense
but
theres
not
much
else
to
say
other
than
it
is
drinkable
as
a
simple
brew
with
a
narrow
profile
another
unimpressive

import
lighty

i
dont
know
why
i
bought
this
just
the
name
of
the
beer
seemed
really
lame
the
green
bottle
didnt
fill
me
with
confidence
either
but
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
appearence
is
a
nice
pale
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
good
carbonation
smell
was
better
than
expected
and
the
beer
went
down
nicely
and
tasted
just
fine
a
slightly
above
average
brew
thats
great
for
summer
golden
pheasant
what
can
i
say
though
not
awful
i
wont
be
purchasing
it
again
the
pheasant
pours
a
light
pale
gold
colour
with
a
whopping
four
finger
head
after
a
while
the
head
creeps
down
to
two
and
is
finished
at
1
12
small
rings
of
lace
are
left
after
every
sip
smells
a
bit
funky
not
quite
lightstruck
skunkiness
but
off
definite
spicy
hop
aroma
didnt
care
much
for
the
taste
perhaps
i
just
dont
like
the
taste
of
saaz
hops
but
i
found
it
lightly
skunky
again
it
was
a
green
bottle
so
light
would
be
a
problem
but
i
just
find
saaz
hops
to
have
that
light
skunk
smell
and
taste
their
is
a
bit
of
spice
and
malt
even
citrus
overall
its
balanced
but
the
saaz
hopsskunk
is
in
charge
mouthfeel
is
lightly
crisp
and
thin
i
guess
its
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
upset
if
i
never
drink
another
while
not
the
best
czech
beer
ive
had
its
still
pretty
decent
the
head
retention
was
fairly
good
with
the
frothy
white
head
the
head
got
less
frothy
after
a
while
and
smoothed
out
to
a
laceing
that
was
still
pretty
thick
itself
the
initial
smell
was
a
little
bit
of
skunkiness
due
to
the
green
bottle
but
then
subsided
over
time
to
a
grainylight
wheaty
smell
the
taste
had
small
elements
of
skunk
in
it
at
first
but
it
went
away
as
well
this
gave
way
to
the
taste
of
mild
hops
and
citrus
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
too
so
i
liked
that
part
while
i
look
at
the
other
reviews
i
think
i
may
have
lucked
out
with
this
bottle
cause
its
previous
reviews
werent
that
great
i
really
did
enjoy
this
brew
nice
golden
color
with
slight
carbonation
and
little
head
slight
hop
aroma
and
a
slight
skunkiness
average
tastepleasant
enough
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
sweetness
somewhat
citrusy
decent
enough
mouthfeel
an
above
average
drinkable
beerthe
slight
skunkiness
detracts
from
what
would
otherwise
be
a
good
pilsthe
first
i
have
had
from
the
slovak
republic
light
gold
in
color
with
a
fizzy
shortlived
head
the
aroma
is
pungent
and
gross
skunk
yuck
i
was
hoping
i
might
get
a
fresh
bottle
aroma
is
telling
me
obviously
not
and
youre
an
idiot
for
buying
an
import
thats
in
a
green
bottle
again
the
skunk
isnt
anywhere
near
as
strong
in
the
flavor
as
in
the
aroma
its
still
drinkable
the
pilsener
crispness
is
there
with
just
enough
hops
for
a
slightly
fun
finish
i
imagine
this
beer
would
taste
pretty
good
and
refreshing
while
fresh
but
i
doubt
most
of
these
green
bottles
sitting
on
shelves
for
months
at
a
time
are
fresh
a
belgium
friend
of
mine
gave
me
a
can
of
this
claiming
it
was
12
abv
because
there
was
a
12
on
the
side
of
the
can
there
was
also
a
5
on
the
side
so
i
have
no
idea
what
the
12
meant
it
poured
extra
foamy
and
when
it
settled
it
was
a
mild
yellow
color
the
taste
at
first
was
nonexistant
but
after
a
few
sips
the
pilsner
style
was
reckognizable
quite
subtle
slightly
citric
this
was
a
beer
meant
for
hot
weather
or
just
as
a
quick
refreshener
the
color
on
the
pour
is
a
limpid
deep
gold
with
a
generous
bright
white
head
that
is
frothy
in
texture
and
the
residual
lace
a
quite
thin
sheet
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
citrus
crisp
fresh
and
clean
sweet
with
the
start
also
sweet
and
fairly
well
malted
top
is
middling
in
feel
finish
is
brisk
in
its
carbonation
and
the
hops
mild
but
pleasant
in
their
spicy
bite
quite
dry
aftertaste
drinkable
at
any
rate
well
judging
from
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
must
have
got
lucky
and
grabbed
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
beer
poured
from
a
halfliter
bottle
this
golden
pheasant
had
a
nice
fluffy
head
with
a
fairly
neutral
nose
crisp
and
fresh
with
a
fairly
assertive
hoppiness
backed
by
a
firm
maltiness
a
dry
and
just
slightly
bitter
finish
aroused
my
appetite
prior
to
dinner
i
would
fit
this
beer
somewhere
between
pilsner
urquell
and
czechbudvar
its
not
the
best
but
i
found
this
pheasant
to
be
worth
the
hunt
at
least
when
found
fresh
as
middle
of
the
road
as
you
want
to
get
this
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
relatively
quickly
the
smell
was
mild
biscuity
malt
and
some
floral
hops
the
taste
was
modest
biscuity
malt
and
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
with
medium
light
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
flavor
lingered
the
drinkability
was
good
a
decent
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
not
one
i
would
choose
to
drink
all
night
there
are
worse
euro
lagers
out
there
but
you
can
also
find
a
ton
of
better
ones
the
nose
does
compliment
the
taste
no
hop
presence
to
speak
of
nothing
special
worth
drinking
i
guess
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
fine
and
medium
sized
white
bubbles
it
has
a
transparent
dark
yellow
orange
body
i
sensed
a
nice
smooth
hoppy
flavor
that
finished
dryly
it
was
smooth
and
very
nice
for
its
style
but
just
an
average
beer
nonetheless
thx

it
had
a
smooth
creamy
taste
to
me
it
had
a
slight
aftertaste
as
well
just
a
soso
beer
just
another
average
pilsner
style
lager
i
would
not
miss
it
if
i
never
had
another
brightgold
color
witha
normal
hop
nose
but
ordinary
dry
hop
flavor
just
a
small
amount
of
malt
flavor
finishes
just
like
it
starts
with
a
medium
to
brief
dry
hop
aftertaste
good
but
lacks
the
complexity
found
in
outstanding
czech
beer
pretty
decent
with
crusty
rye
bread
and
sharp
cheese
the
aroma
was
quite
noticable
just
upon
opening
the
bottle
it
had
a
spicey
hoppy
note
that
wasnt
nearly
as
evident
after
pouring
that
was
more
flat
malt
with
hints
of
hops
big
full
head
brilliant
clear
gold
has
some
nice
qualities
of
many
european
versions
of
similar
style
but
some
unusual
and
less
pleasant
aspects
such
as
a
real
flatness
of
aroma
upon
taking
a
drink
like
drinking
water
and
the
finish
has
a
spiciness
that
ventures
into
sourness
grassiness
and
chemical
tastes
leaving
a
less
than
pleasant
aftertaste
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
too
flat
an
average
overall
beer
not
undrinkable
just
can
easily
do
better
straw
appearance
foamy
white
head
with
good
retention
carbonation
is
evident
aroma
is
a
subtle
mix
of
malt
and
hops
with
the
malt
winning
the
battle
if
youre
looking
for
a
european
pilsner
without
the
big
bitter
factor
this
is
it
its
a
very
pleasant
tasting
beer
nice
malt
base
very
subtle
hop
nuances
a
slight
citric
twang
and
maybe
a
little
metallic
thinnish
body
and
fairly
low
carbonation
very
easy
to
kick
this
one
back
gotta
love
the
name
too
brilliantly
clear
golden
in
hue
covered
by
a
persistant
thick
white
head
dense
lace
leaves
a
solid
ring
per
sip
the
aroma
is
mellow
overall
being
comprised
of
light
straw
like
pilsner
malt
and
a
soft
lemony
and
spicy
hop
nose
the
typical
saaz
grassy
spice
is
subdued
and
perhaps
blended
with
with
tettanger
residual
sweetness
and
light
bready
base
malt
notes
dominate
the
flavor
profile
as
a
result
of
the
subpar
hop
bitterness
although
mild
hop
flavor
is
a
touch
grassy
moderately
bodied
finishes
w
fading
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
dimethyl
sulfide
golden
pheasant
is
a
decent
pils
but
lacked
sufficient
hop
backbone
to
support
malt
sweetness
the
cooked
veggie
note
in
the
finish
hurt
the
drinkability
a
simple
lager
tasty
without
any
complexities
pairs
well
with
any
kind
of
smoked
sausage
i
had
mine
with
some
smoked
sausage
and
slaw
from
the
slovak
republic
half
liter
brown
bottle
golden
pheasant
is
a
golden
lager
with
a
nice
tall
firm
head
had
a
slightly
malty
taste
crisp
not
overwhelming
taste
ill
buy
several
more
as
this
is
what
an
american
macro
is
supposed
to
taste
like
good
basic
drinking
brew
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
a
while
drank
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
but
pour
a
little
for
color
which
was
amber
not
much
carbonation
after
the
initial
opening
of
the
bottle
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
typical
pilsner
in
bitterness
tasted
more
like
an
ipa
with
some
yeast
bready
brown
ale
flavor
o
more
american
west
coast
than
expected
dry
on
the
finish
more
of
an
apa
than
a
pilsner
in
my
opinion
bought
in
chiang
mai
drank
nov
24
2014
a
solid
american
craftstyle
lager
o
a
lager
apa
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
if
not
for
the
off
flavors
for
now
im
not
sure
what
the
lager
part
brings
to
the
table
the
only
yeast
driven
flavors
i
get
are
offflavored
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
by
good
flavors
and
aromas
do
not
understand
the
idea
of
a
bottomfermented
apa
but
its
also
something
that
i
like
about
this
kind
of
cocky
beer
dark
yellowbrown
and
barely
translucent
plenty
of
pleasant
hoppiness
on
the
nose
fruit
mostly
with
a
whiff
of
bitter
resin
the
taste
isnt
obviously
lagery
but
the
malt
base
is
certainly
there
smooth
crisp
and
surprisingly
bitter
its
accessible
drinkable
and
enjoyable
not
a
lot
to
criticisize
other
than
my
inevitable
quibble
with
the
malt
base
overall
a
good
beer
in
the
style
pilsener
very
tasty
a
big
maybe
too
big
plate
of
tasty
bitter
hops
havent
had
enough
of
mikkellers
yet
but
i
hope
his
brews
dont
rely
solely
on
hops
risking
to
be
too
similar
i
expect
a
bit
more
than
that
from
such
expensive
beers
overall
a
superb
brew
and
one
that
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
easily
highly
recommended
o
wow
as
someone
who
likes
heavy
beers
like
imperial
stouts
and
double
ipas
this
blew
me
away
i
never
knew
a
pils
could
have
this
much
flavor
the
perfect
amount
of
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
but
still
lighter
than
a
pale
ale
yum
i
will
definitely
be
trying
to
find
a
case
of
this
overall
really
nice
beer
that
while
retaining
pilsener
character
also
offers
a
crossover
point
with
hopheads
since
the
hops
are
quite
prevalent
here
a
delicious
beer
that
i
would
repurchase
but
only
once
in
a
while
given
that
even
better
beers
albeit
in
different
styles
can
be
purchased
for
less
overall
goes
down
easy
but
still
feels
like
a
proper
hop
packed
beer
very
well
executed
and
interesting
take
on
lager
i
hope
to
see
more
like
this
in
the
future
this
is
a
kick
ass
pilsner
it
has
a
unique
hop
profile
with
more
emphasis
on
citrus
than
the
average
pilsner
very
complex
and
quaffable
near
perfect
balance
a
must
try
mikkeller
can
really
do
no
wrong
finally
found
one
i
havent
had
i
know
there
are
millions
but
i
am
always
in
search
of
this
one
is
going
by
dream
pils
now
pours
a
darker
than
expected
almost
copper
shade
of
gold
with
an
inch
of
thick
white
head
it
smells
almost
funky
like
mikkellers
usual
belgian
yeast
groove
as
well
as
lighter
pilsener
malts
the
flavor
doesnt
have
any
of
that
yeast
to
it
though
and
is
quite
balanced
between
the
hearty
grain
bill
for
the
style
and
the
hops
which
are
bitter
and
prickly
carbonation
is
great
body
is
bigger
than
the
standard
and
the
finish
is
long
and
grassy
this
isnt
one
of
mikkellers
way
out
there
beers
but
more
of
a
regular
drinker
thats
very
well
made
i
wish
it
was
in
affordable
sixers
but
i
say
that
about
must
stuff
mikkeller
makes
when
will
that
be
a
reality
mo
refreshing
medium
bodied
the
flavour
profile
is
rich
and
colourful
accentuating
hops
of
course
a
wellcrafted
highoctave
hoppy
session
lager
ideal
for
any
occasion
in
my
opinion
excellent
execution
balanced
and
flavorful
an
improved
czech
pilsner
slightly
going
towards
an
apa
od
a
decent
pils
too
dry
though
in
the
middle
palate
seemed
to
take
away
from
the
flavour
a
nice
pils
otherwise
and
i
could
have
a
few
rjt
o
a
delicious
beer
that
is
balanced
quite
nicely
overall
just
about
a
perfect
pilsener
crisp
and
dry
with
a
little
more
hops
than
you
might
expect
fresh
and
pure
tastes
of
mineral
grain
and
pine
give
it
a
feel
of
truly
coming
from
the
land
amberblonde
colour
2
fingers
of
white
head
lots
of
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
a
mix
of
crisp
crackery
malt
citrus
and
an
earthy
floralness
hoppy
with
some
lemon
and
melonhoney
dew
and
a
bit
of
peach
taste
starts
of
with
a
crisp
malt
before
getting
into
dry
earthy
hop
flavours
lemony
citrus
fairly
bitter
med
drying
carbonation
lightly
oily
witha
crisp
medium
body
a
nice
hoppy
beer
but
seems
to
be
fairly
similar
to
most
eurodanish
ipas
i
have
come
across
overall
a
good
pilsner
that
unfortunately
didnt
meet
my
expectations
its
got
a
good
look
with
a
great
aroma
but
the
feel
of
the
beer
threw
the
flavour
off
a
lawn
cutting
beer
for
sure
but
not
one
to
form
a
judgement
on
mikkeller
overall
underwhelming
this
beer
is
not
well
balance
and
lacks
a
strong
enticing
aroma
overall
delicious
i
would
buy
this
again
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
say
its
underrated
for
the
style
a
decent
enough
beer
but
a
couple
of
disconnects
im
thinking
theres
no
way
this
is
a
pilsner
and
my
bottle
reads
canadian
dream
at
5
5
not
danish
dream
at
4
6
maybe
a
namingreviewing
template
mixup
mikkellers
canadianamericandanish
dream
is
nice
but
also
forgettable
a
reminder
that
beer
like
anything
else
can
be
a
numbers
game
brew
every
single
recipe
that
comes
to
mind
and
inevitably
a
few
will
turn
out
extraordinary
more
will
flop
and
most
will
end
up
somewhere
in
between
that
broad
allembracing
median
is
exactly
where
id
place
this
offering
a
very
pleasant
surprise
and
a
beer
id
highly
recommend
albeit
not
to
someone
looking
for
a
traditional
czech
pilsener
a
highly
enjoyable
unique
take
on
the
pilsner
style
not
the
bright
crisp
and
clean
brew
that
made
bohemia
famous
however
but
still
a
satisfactorily
bitter
flavorful
brew
overall
kind
of
like
an
english
ipa
taste
wise
this
would
probably
work
well
as
a
session
beer
not
terribly
exciting
but
a
nice
malty
flavour
and
a
good
amount
of
hop
bite
i
probably
wont
buy
more
but
worth
a
try
for
sure

d
this
is
very
good
and
very
easytodrink
and
yet
still
flavourful
enough
to
savour
after
making
the
entrance
that
it
did
all
is
forgotten
overall
not
bad
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
m
light
to
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
o
a
tasty
brew
but
its
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
pils
maybe
they
hopped
up
the
canadian
version
because
the
abv
was
restickered
as
5
5
dont
get
me
wrong
it
was
delicious
but
as
a
pilsener
its
not
really
the
flavour
profile
im
looking
for
i
like
a
sweet
citrus
note
to
complement
the
classic
grassy
pilsener
hop
profile
but
the
citrus
hops
completely
dominate
the
profile
ill
be
buying
more
but
not
something
i
would
recommend
to
someone
who
is
looking
for
a
pilsener
after
243
phantom
reviews
this
is
my
first
leap
into
the
world
of
text
scary
thanks
for
your
understanding
overall
its
a
good
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
im
really
glad
to
have
tried
it
i
definitely
might
say
this
is
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
pilsner
overall
a
great
appearance
and
aroma
but
a
bit
of
a
let
down
with
the
taste
which
just
too
sharp
and
bitter
this
might
be
a
good
beer
to
mature
a
bit
let
the
bitterness
settle
d
nice
hoppy
pilsner
good
overall
balance
i
am
used
to
but
good
none
the
less
any
category
good
one
but
claiming
to
be
a
pilsner
its
a
complete
failure
an
unconventional
take
on
the
pilsner
style
more
of
a
hybrid
between
a
pils
and
a
hoppy
pale
ale
unusual
hop
varieties
in
evidence
however
the
result
is
decidedly
tasty
and
goes
down
only
too
easily
a
fantastic
hop
aroma
and
flavour
with
lots
of
light
fruity
notes
nz
varieties
solid
caramel
backbone
that
keeps
its
distance
though
the
yeast
is
a
bit
full
on
superb
body
almost
too
thick
for
a
lager
a
wellcrafted
brew
that
is
certainly
worth
trying
the
only
thing
that
would
prevent
me
having
it
again
is
the
excessive
price
very
easydrinking
stuff
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
a
pretty
nice
nose
to
this
sweet
malt
and
bread
notes
with
a
touch
of
biscuit
nice
floral
hops
a
hint
of
citrus
peel
and
a
light
yeastiness
the
flavor
is
really
crisp
and
refreshing
good
hop
character
with
plenty
of
floral
notes
and
a
light
bitterness
the
malt
flavors
are
there
but
not
heavy
and
the
yeast
is
present
in
the
background
o
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
a
warm
day
during
the
summer
o
impressive
beer
for
only
4
6
tons
of
hops
that
bombard
the
palate
over
and
over
more
ipl
then
pils
but
its
good
so
who
really
cares
right
def
something
to
enjoy
during
the
hot
summer

caramel
mostly
and
not
really
typical
of

at

thorugh
more
pilsnerlike
on
the
palate
dry
grainy

but
still
some
caramel
malt
prevails
a
bit
grassy

in
terms
of

some
citrusy
american
hopping
resides
in
the
background
medium

and
higher

decent
and
a

of

i
wont
be
returning
to
this
when
my
local
brewery
knocks
out
a
far
superior
pils
at
half
the
cost
drinkable
but
the
2nd
most
disappointing
mikkeller
beer
after
the
wet
hop
keller
bier
for
me
if
this
came
in
a
12
6er
id
be
buying
it
daily
big
flavors
in
something
i
could
session
mikkeller
knows
a
secret
find
a
style
on
the
edge
of
popularity
and
add
a
shitload
of
hops
too
it
b
pours
a
two

that
fades
very
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
hazy
amber
color
medium

and
medium
bodied
grapefruit
nose
and
flavor
is
grapefruit
hops
hints
of
caramel
this
isnt
a
lager
or
a
pilsner
it
tastes
like
an
ipa
even
with
the
low
abv
label
is
dream
pils
expensive
at
6
49
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
o
this
is
a
solid
pale
lager
that
will
likely
be
welcomed
by
fans
of
hoppy
lagers
while
it
is
a
unique
and
likable
beer
in
its
own
right
danish
dream
is
still
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
in
the
sense
that
the
nose
could
use
some
more
depth
and
the
mouthfeel
could
stand
to
be
smoother
and
more
rounded
still
this
is
a
pretty
decent
little
lager
o
super
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
could
and
likely
will
enjoy
several
of
these
in
sitting
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
style
o
this
beer
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
lager
fucking
eh
i
dont
think
ive
ever
encountered
a
lager
as
relatively
ballsout
hoppy
as
this
is
not
too
big
of
a
surprise
given
the
source
but
all
the
same
this
is
a
zesty
enjoyable
tipple
a
solid
lager
base
and
the
rest
you
know
o
not
a
bad
beer
fairly
hoppy
for
an
apa
mostly
toward
the
grapefruit
and
citrus
end
good
euro
take
an
an
apa
definitely
a
unique
take
on
the
style
the
hop
and
malt
flavors
and
aromas
are
well
balanced
and
play
well
off
each
other
crisp
and
clean
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
if
the
price
tag
wasnt
what
it
was
itd
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
a
few
of
in
one
sitting
yeah
a
light
drinkable
brew
nice
flavours
but
clean
and
crisp
d
if
this
beer
werent
so
damn
expensive
itd
make
a
great
summer
session
lager
great
american
hop
profile
fullflavor
nice

no
real
complaints
here
im
really
glad
we
ordered
a
keg
of
this
for
zwanze
day
at
west
lakeview
liquors
a
good
sessionable
beer
very
decent
brew
its
a
mild
style
but
as
usual
mikkeller
has
loaded
it
with
as
much
character
as
the
style
can
possibly
support
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
if
a
lopsided
onedimensional
hopcentric
apa
became
a
lager
this
is
what
it
would
be
while
i
enjoyed
the
good
dose
of
hops
this
didnt
strike
me
as
any
remarkable
especially
for
a
pils
made
with
american
hops
there
is
no
harmony
or
cohesion
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
far
better
than
most
of
the
style
had
this
one
on
tap
on
the
bethlehem
speakeasy
on
12112009
when
i
read
that
this
was
a
pilsner
i
rolled
my
eyes
and
said
to
myself
oh
great
another
pilsner
i
went
with
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
ordered
a
different
beer
from
this
one
and
my
friend
desided
hed
try
this
one
im
so
glad
he
got
it
and
let
me
try
it
i
immediately
bought
myself
my
own
glass
of
it
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
golden
orange
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
nice
foamy
looking
white
head
upon
settling
the
head
left
a
wonderful
lacing
down
the
glass
it
looked
incredible
for
a
pilsner
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
strong
with
hops
some
nice
malts
and
even
a
little
touch
of
fruity
aromas
were
coming
off
this
thing
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
just
as
impressive
as
the
aroma
every
sip
was
just
as
good
as
the
one
before
it
if
not
better
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
had
a
crisp
sharp
finish
overall
this
beer
is
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
pilsner
i
cant
imagine
having
one
that
tops
this
i
would
love
to
have
this
beer
again
one
day
overall
this
was
an
easydrinking
crisp
and
lowabv
beer
something
of
which
id
like
to
have
a
lot
more
well
worth

not

this
beer
looks

and
tastes
a

like
a

it
drinks
a
bit
bigger
than
the
abv
would
suggest
the
beer
has
a
nice

that
leans
toward
american
hops
grapefruit
rind

pine
notes
theres
also
a

the
flavor

yeasty
with

is

that

this

from
its
home
very
drinkable
this
is
a
really
good
pilsneripa
hybrid
that
definitely
falls
more
toward
the
ipa
side
as
it
says
in
brackets
up
top
this
beer
is
called
the
american
dream
on
my
bottle
and
have
been
looking
forwards
to
trying
it
and
gotta
thank
the
boys
at
cellarbrations
carlisle
for
again
getting
their
hands
on
some
new
mikkeller
brews
as
he
has
definately
gotta
be
one
of
my
favourite
brewers
who
just
continues
to
push
the
boundaries
while
still
producing
top
quality
beer
anyways
onto
the
beerit
pours
a
light
copperorange
colour
quite
interesting
for
a
pilsner
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
frothy
two
finger
head
and
clingy
lacing
everywhere
very
impressive
lookingthe
aroma
is
very
citrusy
with
passionfruit
and
tropical
notesit
has
a
very
easy
light
mouthfeel
and
just
slides
down
so
easy
with
beautiful
tastes
of
tropical
fruit
and
a
passionfruity
bitter
finish
but
not
overly
bitter
but
in
my
eyes
too
bitter
to
be
called
a
pilsner
let
alone
a
double
pilsner
and
would
probaly
lean
towards
calling
it
an
american
pale
ale
but
netherless
this
beer
is
absolutely
top
quality
no
matter
what
style
it
comes
under
and
right
now
im
wishing
i
bought
way
more
big
thumbs
up
for
me
this
is
a
great
beer
at
just
4
6
it
isnt
particularly
strong
but
there
is
lots
of
flavour
my
only
criticism
is
that
the
bitterness
is
probably
just
a
touch
high
and
could
do
with
being
toned
down
the
nose
is
all
hops
big
pine
pungency
with
some
citrus
and
a
good
deal
of
bitterness
malt
character
is
practically
nonexistent
the
palate
opens
with
a
big
biting
bitterness
with
pine
and
a
little
grapefruit
theres
solid
hop
flavor
too
but
its
quite
dominated
by
the
bitterness
i
also
get
a
little
more
citrus
and
grapefruit
than
the
nose
would
let
on
again
the
malt
is
practically
absent
there
is
no
real
sweetness
or
anything
really
to
hint
at
the
presence
of
grain
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
resiny
grapefruit
and
pine
bitterness
thoroughly
enjoyable
its
something
id
love
to
try
again
and
it
also
has
me
intrigued
in
the
1000
ibu
beer
coming
up
this
was
an
absolute
treat
to
try
d
quite
possibly
the
perfect
session
beer
fantastic
aromatics
and

satisfying

an
incredibly

a

doesnt

up

sneak

then
make

pours
a
clear
golden

with
a
big
white

with
good
retention
and

aromas
are
big
on
freshly

with

an
initial
honey

sweetness
before
the
green

taste
blended
with
lemon
peel
dominates
the
middle
and
the
finish
id
like
a
pilsner
that
isnt
shy
about
its
taste
this
is
a
wonderful
summer
beer
white
bubbly
head
with
a
pale
straw
body
that
is
hazy
and
very
unfiltered
looking
hop
aroma
is
strong
with
citrus
and
grapefruit
and
some
herbal
notes
taste
is
lightly
bitter
with
crisp
bite
that
fades
to
an
ultra
clean
finish
best
beer
from
this
brewey
hands
down
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
poured
the
hazy
pale
yellow
with
white
head
that
is
leaving
some
lace
the
scent
carries
a
gin
like
flare
with
touches
of
mild
pine
and
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
has
a
great
czech
pils
base
with
a
neat
pinegin
twang
the
mouthfeel
is
m3edium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
straw
gold
very
light
with
a
wispy
head
of
about
one
finger
of
foam
leaves
a
few
strands
of
lace
musty
tropical
fruit
on
the
nose
as
well
as
citrus
and
light
malt
sweetness
taste
is
pretty
hoppy
without
much

backup
citrus
rind
light
resin
a
touch
chalky
pretty

actually
light
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
pilsnery
not
a
bad
summer
beer
i
guess
burp
very
pleasent
o
really
enjoyable
thirst
quenching
o
this
is
a
very
crisp
freshtasting
beer
and
i
think
an
excellent
example
of
a
germanstyle
pilsner
but
highly
americanized
the
bitterness
is
very
assertive
and
i
think
this
would
pair
well
with
a
lot
of
flavorful
richer
or
spicy
foods
no
something
id
drink
a
lot
of
on
its
own
but
i
have
no
complaints
onot
a
subtle
pilsner
more
of
an
over
hopped
blonde
ale
tastes
good
but
not
real
accurate
of
the
style
overall
this
was
an
extremely
impressive
pilsner
style
beer
and
one
that
really
shines
in
the
hot
summer
weather
very
refreshing
overall
experience
along
with
a
nice
cloudy
pale
citrus
colored
appearance
i
am
very
much
a
hoppy
ipa
guy
but
this
is
a
great
beer
very
impressed
o
not
your
average
pilsener
the
hop
profile
is
fantastic
great
session
beer
o
wow
this
one
blew
me
away
a
little
bit
was
not
expecting
so
much
hop
goodness
here
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
how
well
it
worked
since
it
makes
itself
quite
known
but
finishes
very
balanced
this
is
my
third
brew
from
this
wonderful
brewery
and
i
must
say
they
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
in
terms
of
pilsners
pilsener
urquell
has
always
been
the
benchmark
brew
for
me
and
this
one
satisfies
the
cream
corn
and
hopiness
of
the
former
while
adding
a
decisively
american
fresh
hop
characteristic
all
of
its
own
to
balance
out
the
mix
i
would
not
hesitate
to
seek
this
one
out
whenever
im
in
the
need
of
a
good
pilsener
and
i
will
now
pay
close
attention
to
what
this
brewery
releases
cheers
the
flavor
is
far
stronger
than
the
smell
indicates
starts
with
a
soft
pale
malt
taste
with
no
graininess
the
hop
comes
on
very
strong
and
quickly
more
neutral
bitter
than
anything
else
borderline
harsh
certainly
too
much
for
a
pilsner
full
bodied
for
the
style
but
not
too
rich
good
carbonation
i
will
buy
this
whenever
i
am
in
the
area
of
the
one
store
where
i
have
seen
it
at
8
bucks
per
six
pack
its
an
absolute
steal
now
i
just
wish
theyd
package
this
in
a
12
pack
for
16
or
so
to
save
me
buying
a
6pk
for
10
every
time
oi
would
consider
this
an
india
pale
lager
i
would
also
consider
this
a
goddamn
delicious
beer
peaks
best
by
far
i
will
go
hunting
for
this
sneaky
bastard
very
soon
the
ease
of
a
pilsner
with
the
hop
bite
of
an
ipa
sign
me
up
for
that
any
time
the
color
is
a
dull
straw
gold
semiopaque
with
a
good
foamy
white
head
and
some
lacing
a
bubble
here
and
there
very
very
weedlike
scent
strong
and
lovely
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
head
of
eggshell
white
bubbles
the
head
mellows
to
a
rocky
terrain
and
sits
approximately
a
fingers
width
above
the
glass
as
the
head
fades
it
leaves
fluffy
stringclouds
of
lacing
in
body
the
beer
is
clean
and
clear
except
for
a
slight
haze
that
clouds
the
other
side
of
the
glass
constant
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
can
also
be
seen
feeding
the
aggressive
head
of
the
beer
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
superbly
hoppy
moving
from
fresh
cut
grass
hence
the
name
to
juicy
citrus
lemon
peel
and
even
a
ghost
of
herbal
mint
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
decidedly
bitter
up
front
with
a
nice
mellowing
bready
sweetness
moving
in
with
the
middle
and
finish
of
the
sip
though
not
balancing
out
the
beer
the
bitters
taste
decidedly
grassy
with
only
hints
of
citrus
coming
through
acidity
is
light
in
the
mouth
but
does
give
the
beer
a
faint
pop
as
well
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
bitter
fresh
cut
grass
and
pine
this
moves
into
brief
grapefruit
before
the
crackery
malt
flavors
start
to
balance
out
the
sip
the
finish
is
of
bitter
grass
grapefruit
pith
and
just
a
touch
of
salinity
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
heavy
side
of
light
in
body
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
carbonation
definite
effervescence
and
a
mouthfeel
that
is
crisp
smooth
and
slightly
prickly
the
mouth
is
left
dry
and
astringent
once
the
beer
has
left
overall
this
is
an
aggressively
bitter
beer
which
i
both
appreciate
and
wish
for
a
little
less
of
they
captured
the
flavor
of
fresh
cut
grass
rather
well
but
the
astringency
is
a
little
too
high
and
the
pilsner
malt
character
is
a
little
too
light
for
my
taste
in
the
style
this
is
a
good
hoppy
pilsner
that
should
appease
many
a
hophead
but
as
far
as
the
style
goes
it
is
a
bit
unbalanced
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
spring
release
more
complex
than
some
of
the
traditional
offerings
in
this
style
courtesy
of
the
dry
hop
process
but
in
spite
of
that
it
remains
true
to
the
crisp
and
clean
pilsner
style
highly
recommended
o
this
beer
tasted
a
lot
more
like
an
ale
than
a
lager
and
seemed
like
a
hoppier
version
of
an
apa
its
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
like
hops
and
want
something
thats
lighter
in
body
but
i
found
it
unusual
that
it
had
lots
of
crispness
for
a
lager
which
seems
unusual
compared
to
some
of
the
imperial
pale
lagers
that
ive
tried
overall
meh
nothing
special
but
then
again
i
dont
expect
much
from
peak
organic
so
perhaps
its
more
on
the
good
side
for
a
beer
from
them
a
big
hop
presence
that
starts
nice
but
gets
too
lemony
and
astringent
decent
malt
just
wish
there
was
more
of
it
but
too
much
carbonation
and
that
lemon
astringent
character
is
too
much
overall
a
very
well
made
and
tasty
pils
o
very
good
pils
lots
of
fresh
flavor
like
its
name
proceeds
it
to
be
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
options
in
the
style
i
assume
this
is
what
they
were
aiming
for
though
with
a
name
like
fresh
cut
hop
heads
who
want
a
hopforward
low
abv
beer
thats
crisper
than
an
ipa
will
love
it
pilsner
fans
will
not
o
a
nice
hoppy
pilsner
easy
to
drink
and
quite
affordable
give
it
a
go
if
youre
into
the
style
or
lagers
in
general
simply
put
delicious
there
is
a
smooth
light
malt
to
back
up
a
grassy
slightly
skunky
hop
and
yeast
aroma
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
nice
sticky
lace
that
lasts
and
lasts
clean
bitterness
a
little
bit
of
spice
in
there
completely
and
utterly
drinkable
and
refreshing
on
a
cool
sunny
summer
day
this
is
going
to
be
my
always
have
a
sixer
in
the
fridge
beer
for
a
long
time
overall
a
delicious
dry
hopped
pilsner
tasty
chewy
and
delicious
only
3
weeks
old
and
very
fresh
not
traditional
to
dry
hop
a
pilsner
but
this
one
is
here
to
stay
folks
overall
better
as
it
warms
extremely
light
floral
would
not
buy
a
sixer
of
this

i
popped
the
cap
and
commenced
a
slow
steady
pour
so
as
to
not
rouse
any
lees
that
may
have
settled
onto
the
punt
during
my
bottles
stint
in
my
reefer
naturally
this
did
not
allow
for
the
formation
of
any
head
so
i
again
employed
the
bartenders
trick
and
wound
up
with
a
finger
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
that
quickly
fell
leaving
some
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
yellow
srm

with
nequality
clarity
nose
reminded
me
more
of
a
german
pilsner
with
its
biscuity
malt
presence
alongside
of
the
hops
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
the
taste
was
definitely
hopforward
with
a
grassy
lemony
flavor
accompanied
by
the
biscuit
maltiness
to
add
up
to
something
that
reminded
me
of
lemon
biscotti
mmmm
i
had
one
of
these
on
draft
this
past
summer
and
i
remember
it
being
highly
refreshing
i
really
enjoy
crisp
clean
czech
pilsners
on
hot
summer
days
and
this
really
fit
the
bill
that
time
finish
was
dry
clean
and
highly
refreshing
last
pour
cloudy
malt
more
pronounced
still
quite
dry
this
is
one
of
the
very
finest
czech
style
pilseners
ive
ever
had
its
an
exceptional
example
of
the
style
up
there
with
my
other
favorite
pils
mamas
little
yella
lagunitas
blue
paddle
summit
i
would
buy
cases
and
cases
of
this
and
have
it
as
a

in

it
were

still
a

this
is
interesting
it
smells
like
heaven
but
its
really
hoppy
and
bitter
not
a
great
take
on
a
pils
but
an
interesting
experience
carries
the
touch
of
both
breweries
its
easy
drinking
and
subtle
hops
give
it
a
little
life
and
work

dry
your
mouth
it
seems
very
grainy
at
moments
but
then
cuts
back
to
citrus
or
grassy
spices
and
is
quite
easy
to
drink
with
a
lot
of
muted
flavors
that
seem
so
interconnected
that
you
cant
differentiate
them
easy
to
drink
it
was
light
and
crisp
but
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
yet
still
a
real
nice
pilsner
with
above
average
flavor
for
the
style
figures
this
is
probably
the
allaround
best
thing
ive
had
from
the
beer
camp
mix
pack
hoppy
lagers
are
becoming
quite
popular
which
is
a
fun
trend
but
hoppy
iterations
of
czech

have
not
caught
on
yet
pretty
good
very
light
in

again
kiwi

i

there
was
more
this
beer
should
be
year
round
too
or
st
least
during
the
warmer
months
o
the
collaborators
did
a
great
job
at
not
diluting
the
style
too
much
just
a
change
in
hops
and
there
is
a
different
character
but
still
the
flavor
and
overall
beer
comes
out
to
be
a
nice
pilsner
the
nose
starts
with
light
grain
seasoned
with
spicy
hops
and
made
more
interesting
with

in
b
f
pennsylvania
i
really
do
get
some
damn
fresh
great
lakes
and
fat
heads
around
here
so
no
complaints
i
have
a
very
limited
fw
experience
and
this
will
not
sour
it
at
all
looking
forward
to
maybe
fresher
beer
camp
2015
overall
it
was
a
delicious
brew
not
sure
where
the
spice
was
coming
from
but
made
it
interesting
grainy
hoppy
and
forgettable
osadly
another
beer
sn
missed
on
for
the
pack
3
25
warts
and
all
ill
kill
this
entire
growler
in
a
sitting
or
die
trying
o
a
little
too
sulfuric
for
me
o
pretty
solid
but
nothing
spectacular
interesting
mix
of
an
ipa
and
a
pilsner
if
you
like
grassy
beers
this
might
be
the
beer
for
you
o
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
drinker
but
after
this
i
should
reconsider
perfectly
balanced
great
beer
o
it
might
not
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
a
well
done
brew
none
the
less
d
a
really
great
pils
that
is
super
hoppy
and
crisply
refreshing
but
not
all
that
much
of
a
deviation
from
the
regular
pivo
pils
in
my
opinion
i
think
the
regular
pivo
is
a
touch
more
refined
and
i
would
likely
lean
that
way
but
this
is
still
great
just
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a
double
torpedo
or
blindfolded
wookey
here
perhaps
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
big
rocky
bright
white
colored
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
not
so
much
hoppy
but
earthy
a
little
grassy
clean
taste
just
a
touch
of
grainy
malt
and
mild
hop
aftertaste
good
balance
easy
drinking
medium
body
medium
to
high
carbonation
appropriate
for
the
style
pale
golden
body
with
a
finger
of
white
head
bready
aroma
yeast
pils
malt
floral
notes
a
touch
of
citrus
pepper
average
flavor
following
the
aroma
a
bit
unbalanced
lacking
the
drinkability
and
ease
of
the
upper
tier
pilsners
o
im
not
a
consumer
of
many
pilsners
but
this
one
was
quite
good
and
fit
the
style
well
definitely
expected
more
hop
character
though
the
slight
hop
bite
made
this
beer
jump
up
from
meh
to
decent
overall
pretty
decent
like
the
concept
of
using
new
zealand
hops
in
a
pilsner
onice
crisp
summer
pilsener
easy
drinking
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
hop
palate
but
over
all
it
was
good
more
citrusy
then
expected
hmm
i
really
wish
i
knew
which
nz
hop
varietals
were
used
in
this
brew
i
get
a
lot
of
grassy
spicy
hop
notes
and
substantial
bitterness
but
not
much
fruity
and
floral
notes
mentioned
on
the
bottle
overall
it
is
a
well
made
pilsner
but
perhaps
i
had
too
many
expectations
from
the
hops
bottle
poured
a
clear
bright
yellow
color
pilsner
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
citrus
hops
with
some
pungent
notes
is
refreshing
taste
is
dominated
by
some
refreshing
pungent
hops
with
some
light
citrus
notes
with
clean
cereal
notes
from
the
malt
backbone
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
interesting
take
on
the
pilsner
style
but
hops
presence
is
not
as
dominant
as
advertised
this
was
good
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
it
again
a
bit
too
tanic
for
it
to
be
a
go
to
overall
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
given
the
mildness
of
the
smell
taste
and
abv
i
could
probably
crush
a
six
pack
and
not
even
notice
overall
solid
beer
overall
not
as
good
as
i
expected
from
firestone
walker
and
sierra
nevada
but
still
worth
trying
overall
interesting
that
is
minnesotan
for
i
didnt
like
it
but
am
too
nice
to
say
so
outright
the
sulfur
and
bitterness
is
just
too
much
for
me
not
well
balanced
for
a
pilsner
and
not
crisp
enough
the
worst
of
the
beer
camp
box
so
far
crisp
from
start
to
finish
and
very
refreshing
very
easy
to
consume
i
think
it
is
a
good
pilsner
o
a
very
nice
pilsener
hoppy
and
thus
fruity
as
advertised
could
easily
pass
for
someones
exceptional
summer
brew
this
is
the
third
or
fourth
collab
i
have
tried
from
the
bcaa
pack
so
far
and
they
have
all
been
good
if
a
bit
unusual
a
very
nice
malty
pilsner
45
ibu
that
has
a
bright
start
on
the
tongue
and
as
the
name
suggest
a
blast
of
hops
just
as
it
begins
to
finish
the
hops
do
not
linger
to
long
giving
this
wonderful
offering
the
job
of
thirst
quencher
to
bad
theres
only
two
of
them
in
my
case
because
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
summer
fun
i
thought
this
one
was
pretty
good
not
sure
why
so
many
low
reviews
its
not
as
good
as
an
authentic
pilsner
but
its
close
beer
is
extremely
clear
and
light
with
a
nice
czech
hoppiness
to
it
finish
is
a
little
harsh
but
not
bad
pilsner
generally
gets
a
bad
wrap
as
a
craft
beer
style
and
certainly
isnt
my
favorite
but
the
guys
at
sierra
really
hit
this
one
on
the
head
that
funky
smell
you
get
from
a
fresh
traditional
german
pils
is
apparent
great
balance
even
for
being
classified
as
a
hoppy
pilsner
by
the
brewers
clean
and
refreshing
sessionable
that
said
theres
a
level
of
excellence
this
one
doesnt
rise
to
maybe
its
the
stigma
of
the
style
but
this
one
gets
only
a
b
from
me
decidedly
above
average
but
no
real
wow
factor
excellent
bohemian
pilsner
wonderful
body
and
mouthfeel
hops
were
so
spot
on
felt
like
i
was
back
europe
drinking
glasses
of
fresh
hoppy
bitter
pils
agree
with
dim
stand
out
beer
camp
beer
this
needs
to
be
made
again
as
a
regular
beer
very
well
done
hoppy
aromas
of
pithy
citrus
wet
hay
and
a
touch
of
something
floral
big
hop

crackers
and
biscuits
shined
through
as
well

every
bit
as
good
as
it

slightly
resinous

punctuated
by
earthy
grass
and
flowers

in
the
form
of
mineraly

bone
dry

we
ith
3
to
go
this
is
the
best
of
beer
camp
so
far
taste
is
brightly
carbonated
and
clean
yet
thin
in
body
perhaps
over
attenuated
in
nature
warming
reveals
more
lemony
hops
and
a
touch
of
spice
on
the
aroma
yet
misses
the
mark
a
bit
as
for
flavor
intriguing
and
hoppy
nonetheless
spicy
feel
is
okay
but
drinkability
is
questionable
overall
cool
take
on
the
style

hops
worked
really
well
with
this

taste
is
snappy

light

easy

overall
well
put
together
something
id
drink
again
i
really
enjoy
a
west
coast
style
pilsner
so
i
was
excited
to
sample
this
overall
i
enjoyed
it
nice
combo
of
pilsner
body
with
aroma
and
flavor
hops
turned
up
to
11
my
favorite
from
the
beer
camp
collection
a
decent
and
refreshing
beer
but
among
the
least
impressive
to
me
from
the
beer
camp
series
o
probably
decent
for
the
style
but
again
not
my
favorite
style
and
i
dont
care
for
the
funk
overall
very
enjoyable
its
extremely
hoppy
for
a
czech
pilsner
up
front
but
i
appreciate
that
it
retains
the
characteristics
of
the
style
in
the
finish
this
is
a
light
bodied
offering
that
is
modestly
carbonated
it
is
crisp
and
easy
drinking
i
would
have
liked
to
felt
more
of
that
notorious
new
zealond
hop
profile
in
this
but
even
without
it
this
was
quite
enjoyable
overall
a
fairly
nice
tasting
pale
ale
that
had
a
good
hop
blend
and
a
more
moderate
dryness
and
drinkability
in
my
opinion
a
higher
carbonation
would
have
really
heightened
the
beer
overall
and
would
have
made
it
much
more
appropriate
for
style
but
overall
this
is
a
rather
nice
pale
ale
overall
a
pretty
good
twist
on
a
pilsner
good
upfront
kick
of
floral
and
juicy
hops
with
a
solid
pils
malt
backing
i
think
this
beer
would
have
benefited
from
canning
as
well
it
must
be
amazing
on
tap
though
terrific
pilsner
can
we
get
a
case
next
summer
wow
what
a
disappointment
o
nice
take
on
a
classic
style
nothing
extraordinary
here
but
it
is
well
crafted
happy
to
try
it
o
a
nice
pilsner
base
that
incorporates
the
extra
hops
nicely
doesnt
go
overboard
on
the
bitterness
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
solid
part
of
the
12pack
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
white
soapy
head
laces
the
glass
well
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
wet
noble
style
hops
coming
off
very
tea
like
pungent
and
herbal
in
the
taste
bread
cracker
and
high
alpha
zesty
new
zealand
hops
giving
of
distinct
flavor
just
like
the
aroma
fair
bitterness
but
just
very
fresh
tasting
clean
and
crisp
lighter
body
with
high
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
pils
with
distinct
hops
o
the
hops
are
a
nice
addition
to
an
otherwise
wellmade
pilsner
o
solid
nothing
more
its
stymied
by
a
slightly
honey
sweet
feel
when
i
really
like
more
of
a
floral
dry
bitterness
to
my
pilsners
still
its
fairly
good
if
unremarkable
this
beer
wasnt
at
all
what
i
expected
it
to
be
its
still
solid
however
it
isnt
exactly
my
style
i
get
notes
of
floral
hops
and
a
sweet
malty
taste
with
very
slight
notes
of
citrus
and
pepper
the
balance
of
this
beer
confuses
me
a
little
because
i
feel
like
i
am
hit
with
flavors
randomly
instead
of
it
having
an
overall
structure
all
together
its
still
a
good
beer
i
almost
wish
i
had
another
one
just
to
take
more
time
to
understand
it
more
taste
is
classic
pilsner
only
in
your
face
and
intense
like
billy
mays
however
not
annoying
a
crisp
hop
floral
bite
gives
way
to
clean
grain
biscuity
malt
flavor
with
a
dry
herbal
bitter
finish
this
is
a
seriously
pumped
pilsner
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
this
torpedo
pilsner
has
followed
the
general
suit
of
the
rest
of
the
beers
in
the
beer
camp
set
as
i
have
found
these
are
all
solid
beers
this
hoppy
pilsner
is
as
exactly
as
described
the
nose
has
some
medium
floral
notes
not
much
of
malt
can
be
found
here
appearance
was
of
a
clear
dark
golden
color
and
was
consumed
directly
from
the
bottle
so
lacing
and
finer
details
were
lost
upon
me
mouth
feel
was
excellent
and
light
with
plenty
of
carbonation
the
taste
of
this
beer
came
with
a
nice
bite
up
front
from
the
generous
hops
and
faded
quickly
to
a
light
sweet
malty
note
that
failed
to
linger
long
enough
for
my
tastes
overall
this
a
good
beer
and
if
offered
in
six
packs
i
would
happily
take
upon
the
chance
to
partake
o
a
hoppy
pilsner
that
is
easily
drinkable
and
quite
flavorful
the
body
was
mostly
crisp
but
did
have
a
slightly
stickysweet
finish
drinkability
was
very
good
the
bottle
was
gone
in
a
few
quick
gulps
overall
while
a
very
nice
brew
its
not
one
i
would
grab
over
the
multitude
of
other
fine
pilseners
out
there
these
days
certainly
worth
trying
though
overall
this
is
one
of
the
simpler
additions
to
the
beer
camp
12pack
but
it
proves
that
simplicity
goes
a
long
way
id
love
to
sit
on
a
porch
and
crush
four
or
five
of
these
while
the
sun
sets
the
flavor
is
very
mild
up
front
with
slight
spice
and
mild
grass
with
light
herbal
and
lemony
hop
flavors
with
secondary
malt
in
the
taste
addinga
bit
of
sweetness
to
create
a
near
perfect
level
of
balance
with
light
yeast
in
the
semidry
and
gently
bitter
finish
this
is
a
top
notch
pilsner
it
seems
more
german
than
czech
based
on
the
hop
flavors
which
are
less
spicyan
excellent
first
taste
from
the
beer
camp
case
and
enjoyable
lager
the
mouthfeel
was
zesty
with
plenty
of
carbonation
medium
bodied
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
one
i
would
likely
seek
out
again
i
have
to
be
honest
when
it
comes
to
beers
in
the
pils
style
id
just
assume
go
a
bit
more
traditional
where
that
clean
and
crisp
malt
profile
can
shine
if
i
want
lots
of
hops
im
more
than
happy
to
reach
for
an
ipa
or
similar
beer
d
i
think
this
is
another
solid
brew
from
the
variety
pack
really
hoppy
yet
remaining
a
true
pils
a
sort
of
americannew
zealand
pils
but
i
still
like
it
not
sure
where
this
will
end
up
in
my
final
rankings
but
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
it
were
up
there
overall
really
nice
beer
with
some
really
great
flavors
havent
had
many
pilsners
but
this
one
makes
me
eager
to
try
more
d
a
very
respectable
lager
and
introduction
to
this
years
beer
camp
across
america
but
nothing
remarkable
either
a
unique
color
and
assertive
aroma
highlight
this
offering
the
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
are
average
to
solidly
above
average
the
end
result
is
an
enjoyable
offering
though
im
hoping
for
a
bit
more
for
the
rest
of
the
beers
in
the
collection
pours
slightly
yellowgolden
color
with
half
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
is
mild
there
is
very
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
has
an
apple
aroma
with
a
funky
lager
malt
i
usually
get
from
lagers
malty
taste
up
front
with
a
grassy
hop
bitterness
to
follow
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
slightly
funky
difficult
to
discern
any
particular
flavors
to
the
malt
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
for
a
lager
it
is
just
not
my
style
a
pretty
good
pilsner
not
a
style
i
would
pick
for
a
collaboration
between
firestonewalker
and
sierra
nevada
but
not
a
bad
beer
either
not
as
hopped
up
as
promised
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
pilsner
o
really
like
this
style
of
hopped
up
pilsner
easy
drinking
but
with
some
more
flavor
than
most
pilsners
reminds
me
of
prima
pils
from
victory
i
like
this
hoppy
pils
much
more
than
firestones
pivo
pils
o
a
good
enough
beer
but
not
maybe
as
good
a
pilsener
lacked
some
of
the
crisp
lean
tightness
the
brisk
quality
that
ive
found
in
other
pilseners
shared
with
my
buddy
out
of
a
sierra
mascara
and
a
fw
tulip
brew
pours
a
murky
golden
with
streaky
lacing
nose
is
a
hoppy
pilsner
really
nice
taste
to
match
super
easy
drinking
and
well
executed
really
wish
i
couldve
tried
this
one
fresher
but
really
dug
it
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
aromas
and
flavors
of
grassy
hops
in
this
pilsener
the
dominance
of
the
hops
is
similar
to
what
you
see
in
ipls
o
overall
not
bad
but
i
would
challenge
the
hoppy
pilsner
description
a
bit
hops
are
there
for
sure
but
this
even
pales
in
comparison
to
a
good
german
pilsner
for
hop
character
misses
the
really
crisp
hop
bitterness
of
a
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
right
on
though
for
the
style
taste
is
sharp
and
with
a
definite
hop
snap
with
the
new
zealand
hops
taking
this
one
into
a
new
realm
of
extra
hoppy
lagers
a
delicious
brew
and
one
i
wish
i
could
revisit
the
verdict
not
bad
a
good
well
balanced
hoppy
pilsner
very
similar
to
fws
pivo
pils
the
new
zealand
hops
give
it
a
different
flavor
in
a
good
way
o
overall
this
is
another
solid
pilsner
for
us
to
enjoy
but
for
my
personal
tastes
it
is
just
a
bit
to
unbalanced
being
so
hop
dominated
overall
not
that
great
would
not
have
this
again
this
is
very
well
done
so
many
classic
qualities
for
style
and
then
perfectly
hopped
very
impressive
there
seem
to
be
2
entries
for
this
hopefully
they
get
merged
soon
an
interesting
and
wellmade
light
brew
that
captures
the
essence
of
a
pilsner
unfortunately
is
goes
above
and
beyond
in
the
west
coast
style
of
too
much
hops
is
better
from
the
12
oz
bottle
in
the
2014
beer
camp
twelvepack
purchased
at
litickers
in
ocean
beach
o
a
fine
pilsner
that
excels
in
many
criteria
and
is
a
fine
brew
o
of
the
4
ive
had
so
far
from
the
12pack
ballast
point
new
glarus
fff
this
is
easily
the
leading
contender
essentially
its
a
czech
pilsner
with
just
a
little
bit
extra
kick
that
is
very
wellexecuted
and
remarkably
easy
to
drink
pours
a
golden
hue
that
eagerly
catches
the
light
in
my
kitchen
thick
swirls
of
lace
cling
to
my
glass
minimal
sleepy
head
thats
easily
awakened
with
a
swirl
lots
of
bread
and
citrus
in
the
nose
wonderfully
grassy
with
a
thin
oily
mouthfeel
im
enjoying
watching
the
bubbles
escape
from
the
bottom
of
my
tulip
glass
i
think
folks
are
missing
it
on
this
brew
its
a
damn
good
pils
that
id
like
to
have
again
o
refreshing
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
a
really
nice
pilsner
with
a
touch
of
hoppiness
definitely
one
that
i
hope
gets
brought
back
again
a
big
hit
with
most
of
the
family
at
dinner
tonight
i
was
expecting
a
strong
hopping
but
it
isnt
the
full
force
i
anticipated
a
more
straightforward
pilsner
than
i
would
expect
as
a
collaboration
brew
but
it
is
still
very
good
o
very
well
done
to
begin
with
its
a
very
clean
technically
sound
pilsner
the
new
zealand
hops
bring
some
exotic
flair
but
dont
steal
the
show
hop
flavor
and
aroma
go
deeper
and
get
more
complex
than
the
average
pilsner
but
only
a
little
bolder
a
great
take
on
a
classic
style
accented
by
some
exotic
hops
and
sierras
patented
hop
torpedo
o
this
was
off
to
a
good
start
but
in
the
end
it
kinda
let
me
down
still
it
was
pretty
good
o
its
a
hoppy
pils
nothing
i
be
seeking
out
even
if
it
as
made
again
pours
out
a
rich
golden
body
with
a
thin
head
smells
strongly
of
herbal
floral
hops
and
crackery
grainy
malts
flavor
is
very
malty
bready
crackery
and
honeyed
hops
dont
offer
excessive
bitterness
but
they
provide
lots
of
floral
flavor
light
bitterness
and
dryness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
the
carbonation
is
moderate
a
great
pilsner
unsurprising
as
both
sn
and
fw
put
out
great
examples
this
one
is
more
summerfest
than
pivo
this
really
seems
to
be
missing
the
noble
angle
and
on
top
of
it
the
so
called
fruity
and
floral
new
zealand
oomph
is
nowhere
to
be
found
part
of
the
beer
camp
compilation
collaboration
between
sierra
nevada
and
firestone
walker
this
guy
pours
light
light
light
this
is
the
needle
in
the
haystack
because
it
would
blend
perfect
with
some
hay
not
the
biggest
nose
here
but
those
classic
pilsner
malts
come
through
after
taking
a
sip
the
flavor
makes
up
for
the
mediocre
nose
crisp
clean
pilsner
just
as
it
should
be
lots
of
dry
hops
on
the
back
end
really
tasty
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
out
of
the
beer
camp
maybe
the
best
of
the
lagers
the
fruity
new
zealand
hops
pair
so
well
with
that
pale
lager
flavor
a
little
citrus
a
little
yeasty
just
really
well
balanced
i
would
def
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
if
i
could
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
while
the
floralsoapy
element
isnt
necessarily
objectively
bad
it
just
doesnt
float
my
particular
boat
o
easy
drinking
overall
nice
beer
nothing
to
complicated
just
a
style
done
really
well
thats
smooth
low
alcohol
and
easy
to
enjoy
i
would
have
no
problem
buying
this
beer
for
the
summertime
when
i
want
a
little
more
kick
then
a
pilsner
but
not
a
ibu
monster
ipa
overall
a
decent
well
crafted
beer
the
hopping
choices
really
make
this
beer
stand
out
they
did
a
great
job
selecting
nz
hops
to
get
a
spicey
profile
in
line
with
noble
hops
omy
first
beer
of
the
variety
pack
and
this
one
was
a
hit
with
me
its
very
hoppy
but
i
still
equate
it
to
a
pilsner
as
opposed
to
the
new
trendy
india
pale
lager
firestone
nailed
their
pivo
pils
so
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
o
a
very
welldone
pilsner
would
enjoy
this
anytime
anywhere
o
enjoyed
this
variation
of
a
pils
low
expectations
going
in
but
pleasantly
surprise
by
the
brew
id
make
it
a
regular
pilslager
purchase
overall
the
type
of
pilsner
i
cant
wait
to
seek
out
again
and
again
especially
when
it
comes
to
over
hopped
light
lagers
like
this
is
impressive
beer
brewed
in
chico
ca
by
sierra

brewing
collaborating
with

overall
good
hoppy
lager
not
as
good
as

excellent

with

that
falls
just
shy
of

overall
a
good
pils
albeit
a
bit
sweet
im
also
not
getting
much
intense
fruity
notes
from
the
new
zealand
hops
o
a
very
nice
hoppy
pilsner
this
is
one
i
would
love
to
see
these
breweries
revisit
finishing
crisp
clean
and
highly
refreshed
its
bitterness
is
a
welcome
reprieve
from
its
floral
upstart
a
mild
detergentlike
taste
is
peculiar
but
never
really
interferes
with
the
balance
its
light
body
is
effortless
especially
after
contending
with
such
relative
complexity
o
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
pilsner
crisp
and
easy
drinking
but
nothing
mind
blowing
the
beer
pours
a
very
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
still
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
the
beer
itself
a
clear
straw
yellowish
gold
the
beer
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
and
hoppy
the
sweet
is
more
of
a
sweet
and
bready
malt
smell
while
the
hop
is
a
grassy
and
floral
smell
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
floral
notes
with
a
sweet
and
bready
backbone
to
take
a
little
of
the
hop
edge
off
other
than
that
the
beer
is
not
overly
complex
and
a
little
bit
more
hop
forward
than
the
average
pilsner
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
bodied
but
on
the
heavy
side
the
beer
has
biting
carbonation
but
a
little
heavy
when
compared
to
the
average
pilsner
overall
the
beer
is
decent
firestones
original
pils
is
much
better
and
just
adding
hops
to
something
you
already
feels
like
they
just
phoned
it
in
im
not
saying
its
bad
but
im
saying
that
firestone
probably
missed
a
good
opportunity
to
get
a
little
creative
o
one
of
the
sweeter
pilsners
ive
had
its
a
got
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
im
actually
digging
bottle
says
its
hoppy
but
i
didnt
pick
up
much
hops
its
an
easy
drinker
that
tastes
good
but
nothing
mindblowing
overall
i
love
this
and
expected
this
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
out
of
the
variety
pack
i
just
wish
sierra
nevada
would
produce
something
like
this
year
round
it
would
be
my
go
to
very
light
straw
brilliant
lighter
than
expected
very
floral
aroma
and
the
hop
flavoring
character
comes
across
more
minerally
than
expected
but
hop
bitterness
definitely
dominates
the
crackery
pilsner
malt
is
light
its
a
bit
more
bitter
than
id
prefer
o
im
not
a
pils
guy
but
i
would
drink
this
again
a
nice
summer
drink
and
a
definite
step
up
from
the
ones
ive
tried
a
good
start
to
the
12
pack
ive
arranged
them
by
abv
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
the
appearance
was
a
nice
pale
orange
the
smell
was
full
of
hops
with
floral
and
grapefruit
scents
the
taste
had
all
those
great
hop
flavors
which
were
nice
and
complex
but
also
had
a
nice
bit
of
toast
and
herb
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
still
had
a
good
body
to
it
i
liked
it

and
taste
mild
on
most
counts
with
a
light
floral

and
common
pils
palate
of
flavor
good
not
great
a
lot
of
friends
around
the
country
are
all
about
firestone
walker
so
i
havent
given
up
on
my
first
try
maybe
me
and
my
boy
will
update
after
we
get
through
the
2nd
12pk
of
the
beer
camp
this
beer
has
not
been
getting
much
love
but
really
for
the
style
which
i
had
little
interest
in
to
begin
with
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
good
its
not
worth
the
price
if
broken
down
into
a
12
pack
but
for
something
different
in
a
mixed
12
pack
this
beer
is
not
bad
i
did
enjoy
it
i
know
there
are
haters
out
there
but
for
a
style
that
isnt
all
that
great
to
begin
with
this
one
is
better
than
most
looks
like
a
pilsner
basically
a
clear
gold
a
bit
thicker
than
i
would
expect
for
the
style
bready
and
thick
yeast
tones
with
a
mildly
inky
thing
in
there
feel
is
a
bit
thicker
also
feels
like
it
could
use
some
filtration
regardless
still
a
pretty
nice
pils
o
while
i
have
used
light
a
lot
in
this
review
it
works
quite
well
for
me
for
the
style
i
think
its
a
decent
brew
a
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
pilsner
the
west
coast
hops
are
fantastic
here
they
retain
some
of
the
spiciness
of
a
traditional
bohemian
pilsner
while
also
adding
in
some
mild
citrus
and
melon
notes
white
foam
head
over
a
very
pale
gold
beer
decent
lacing
good
retention
smell
is
faintly
of
biscuit
and
crackers
there
really
isnt
much
there
taste
is
mildlybearthy
hay
biscuit
and
cracker
decent
pilsner
not
really
getting
the
intense
new
zealand
hops
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
quaffable
beer
clean
finish
nothing
exciting
here
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
my
first
out
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
pack
im
following
snbills
drinking
order
for
it
ive
heard
this
is
one
of
the
better
from
the
pack
and
so
far
it
is
a
nice
little
hoppy
pilsner
but
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
hopforward
i
guess
this
might
be
the
closest
i
get
to
trying
fws
pivo
pils
anytime
soon
but
i
cant
wait
to
try
that
o
if
this
was
a
regular
i
would
drink
it
frequently
this
is
on
the
same
plane
as
prima
pils
and
the
crisp
its
hard
to
call
it
a
german
or
czech
style
due
to
the
prominence
of
both
the
hops
and
the
malt
its
very
well
balanced
and
goes
down
so
so
easily
very
very
well
done
overall
4
25
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
be
dynamite
when
its
fresh
but
eight
weeks
is
about
as
young
as
i
could
have
hoped
to
have
tried
it
so
ill
take
it
for
what
it
isand
thats
still
pretty
damn
awesome
i
would
drink
beer
like
this
all
the
time
if
it
were
more
readily
available
crisp
lean
complex
punchy
but
not
aggressive
balancedits
just
all
there
excellent
and
itd
be
awesome
if
this
got
brewed
again
and
distributed
fresh
o
ill
admit
i
was
expecting
a
pilsner
hopped
in
the
american
style
but
in
actuality
this
is
a
beer
that
is
more
like
an
overhopped
traditional
pilsner
not
bad
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
light
to
medium
straw
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
grassy
european
hops
with
floral
notes
biscuit
malt
flavor
begins
with
biscuit
malt
and
light
floral
hops
developing
drier
crackery
malt
with
more
grassy
and
floral
hops
finishing
semi
dry
with
a
nice
balance
of
biscuit
and
grassy
floral
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
active
carbonation
a
very
nice
take
on
the
pilsner
style
covering
all
the
classic
flavor
notes
but
tasting
fresher
and
brighter
with
the
interesting
fragrent
hop
elements
very
nice
pilsner
o
this
is
very
enjoyable
there
is
more
to
the
beer
than
what
you
get
from
the
nose
and
first
sip
it
gets
better
as
you
drink
it
i
could
drink
this
all
day
while
at
the
beach
or
on
a
boat
probably
wouldnt
pick
this
up
again
but
if
it
was
offered
would
give
it
another
go
seems
best
for
high
summer
poured
a
beautiful
cloudy
rich
golden
yellow
with
two
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
a
gorgeous
looking
pilsner
scents
of
floral
jasmine
perfumelike
hops
a
faint
touch
of
tropical
fruit
and
a
honeygraham
cracker
character
from
the
pils
malt
a
crisp
clean
appealing
aroma
profile
most
similar
to
a
german
pilsner
with
a
bit
more
fruit
character
than
is
common
for
the
style
flavor
begins
nicely
bitter
with
crisp
floral
hop
flavors
and
a
low
yet
present
pils
malt
sweetness
and
an
extremely
faint
hint
of
citrus
peel
the
middle
is
dominated
by
floral
hop
flavors
with
a
moderate
bitterness
level
and
a
slight
presence
of
pils
malt
sweetness
finish
is
dry
with
floral
hop
flavors
most
reminiscent
of
jasmine
with
some
slight
herbal
hop
character
in
the
background
aftertaste
is
floral
hops
with
notes
of
jasmine
with
moderate
bitterness
and
a
slight
hint
of
graininess
a
good
german
pilsner
flavor
very
much
balanced
towards
floral
hops
with
malt
present
but
not
overwhelming
at
any
point
in
the
sip
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderatehigh
carbonation
and
a
crisp
drying
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
german
pilsner
that
brings
a
well
rounded
reasonably
dry
floral
flavor
balanced
against
just
enough
pils
malt
in
the
flavor
combining
with
a
nice
aroma
and
mouthfeel
not
the
most
daring
experiment
but
quite
good
regardless
to
be
honest
im
rather
let
down
that
this
is
the
best
a
safs
collab
could
come
up
with
this
was
more
than
just
meh
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
more
than
happy
to
know
it
is
a
oneoff
an
easy
going
interesting
take
on
the
style
not
that
different
from
any
other
good
well
hopped
pilsener
out
there
but
a
very
well
mad
beer
super
tasty
this
one
refreshing
it
needs
to
come
in
a
six
pack
for
firestone
walker
im
not
all
that
impressed
its
better
than
pivo
i
think
but
awfully
similar
in
terms
of
the
base
and
the
intensity
of
the
hops
the
only
real
distinction
for
me
was
a
little
more
grain
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
some
different
hop
varietals
in
the
recipe
but
other
than
that
its
real
close
to
pivo
we
all
thought
that
said
pivo
is
a
remarkable
brew
one
of
the
better
always
available
examples
of
the
style
so
not
complaining
here
just
a
little
samey
for
me
very
light
body
on
this
one
with
very
active
carbonation
the
right
feel
for
this
seasonally
appropriate
brew
hops
are
more
grassy
and
fresh
veggies
than
they
are
bitter
but
its
a
nice
complexion
on
the
end
to
balance
the
pils
malt
out
nothing
special
as
with
some
others
in
the
box
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
not
by
a
mile
this
is
great
pilsener
overall
a
nice
hoppy
pils
a
little
too
sweet
and
metallic
crystal
clear
pale
gold
beer
with
a
big
airy
head
the
nose
is
kinda
overthetop
hoppiness
for
a
pils
i
guess
thats
the
point
by
naming
it
torpedo
they
tend
fresh
pineneedle
scent
flavor
though
is
deadon
pils
though
on
the
far
bitter
side
clean
malt
and
the
hops
flavor
here
is
about
what
you
expectfloral
maybe
just
a
tad
piney
very
dry
finish
interesting
though
it
wears
on
you
through
the
whole
glass
the
bitterness
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
fortunately
this
is
the
only
one
in
the
case
overall
not
much
of
a
pilsner
fan
but
like
this
one
better
than
of
course
those
horrible
domestics
this
would
be
a
beer
that
would
be
good
for
drinking
on
hot
days
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
i
would
drink
this
anytime
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
grass
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
grass
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
refreshing
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
pilsner
has
big
hop
character
but
it
reminded
me
very
much
of
a
traditional
czech
pilsner
hop
character
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
new
zealand
hops
easy
drinking
summer
pilsner
but
i
actually
prefer
firestone
walkers
pivo
pils
and
sierra
nevadas
summerfest
to
this
joint
effort
pours
a
light
golden
straw
color
tranparent
with
lots
of
effervescing
and
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
hay
hops
an
citrus
light
and
mild
taste
shares
a
lot
in
common
with
some
of
the
american
adjunct
pilsners
lots
of
hay
and
mild
maltiness
but
with
some
citrusy
and
piney
hops
on
top
dry
with
some
subtle
black
pepper
spice
feel
is
light
refreshing
and
lively
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
good
refreshing
easy
drinker
o
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
czech
pilsner
going
into
this
i
was
initially
excited
to
try
a
hoppy
pilsner
that
firestone
walker
had
a
hand
in
making
because
ive
heard
so
many
good
things
about
pivo
pils
but
if
pivo
tastes
anything
like
this
im
personally
not
missing
out
on
anything
12
ounce
bottle
part
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
12pack
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
the
brew
smells
like
grassy
and
citrusy
hops
lemon
peel
grainybready
malt
and
a
bit
of
white
grapes
it
tastes
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
tropical
fruit
and
light
piney
hops
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
but
also
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
good
carbonation
i
thought
it
was
a
good
pilsener
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
cheers
o
again
i
found
some
similarities
to
summerfest
here
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
easy
drinking
on
a
warm
summer
day
id
go
for
this
again
overall
this
is
an
oddly
subdued
beer
given
that
it
is
a
collaboration
between
two
well
regarded
breweries
dont
really
know
what
they
were
going
for
here
but
the
end
result
is
underwhelming
a
very
well
done
hoppy
pilsner
as
i
would
expect
from
firestone
and
sierra
nevada
certainly
something
i
could
enjoy
more
than
one
of
simple
but
still
quite
tasty
perfect
for
relaxing
on
a
warm
summer
day
after
mowing
the
yard
as
i
work
my
way
through
the
pilsner
glass
the
flavor
evolves
somewhat
from
a
straight
up
toasted
biscuit
malt
taste
and
modest
hops
to
a
more
dry
hopped
finish
and
a
fading
biscuit
character
overall
a
solid
good
beer
that
is
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
pilsners
12oz
bottle
from
the
new
mixed
twelve
that
just
came
out
yellow
color
slight
hazy
good
head
aroma
was
a
hoppy
pilsner
flavor
was
good
crisp
definitely
had
a
nice
citrus
like
hop
aspect
to
it
i
would
actually
probably
buy
this
if
it
came
in
sixers
overall
nice
take
on
a
pilsner
despite
the
unique
hops
it
is
very
balanced
and
refreshing
overall
ultimately
not
that
different
from
other
very
solid
czech
pils
this
may
disappoint
some
but
i
am
fine
with
that
clear
straw
colored
pour
with
a
white
onefinger
head
grainy
aroma
and
initial
taste
the
light
to
medium
body
has
a
solid
grass
flavor
with
a
mild
hop
presence
at
the
end
drinks
easy
and
is
very
refreshing
good
but
a
bit
average
was
kind
of
expecting
a
stronger
hop
flavor
i
want
to
drink
about
six
of
these
but
alas
i
have
only
two
of
the
beer
camp
12s
and
i
will
share
overall
quite
reminiscent
of
the
fw
pivo
pils
in
fact
id
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
neither
of
which
delivered
on
the
hop
promise
of
their
labels
solid
beer
regardless
but
nothing
ill
miss
too
terribly
once
this
12
pack
is
no
longer
available
pours
a
somewhat
pale
gold
it
appears
to
have
a
touch
of
haze
but
its
bright
and
shiny
in
the
light
mediumsized
head
of
fine
foam
good
retention
moderate
lacing
good
looking
beer
the
aroma
has
lager
sulfur
fruity
hops
fresh
pale
grain
and
a
little
bit
of
that
lagery
yeastiness
hops
are
a
nice
mix
of
light
stone
fruit
tropical
notes
and
grapes
some
mint
in
there
as
well
that
said
hops
are
more
restrained
than
expected
the
underlying
pils
seems
solid
relatively
dry
moderate
bitterness
probably
would
seem
stronger
with
a
drier
crisper
pils
base
fresh
sugary
malt
good
lager
yeast
flavor
prickly
carbonation
recedes
relatively
quickly
fair
bit
of
hop
oiliness
for
a
pils
which
kinda
throws
things
off
for
me
i
like
this
beer
but
i
think
the
thought
was
a
bit
better
than
the
execution
id
love
to
see
how
these
hops
would
fare
in
a
crisp
bright
bohemianstyle
pils
o
a
solid
pilsner
overall
i
would
like
a
little
more
hop
presence
beyond
a
lingering
bitterness
o
high
ibu
45
for
a
pils
and
the
hops
are
not
the
normal
noble
types
it
provides
a
nice
change
for
the
pils
style
and
is
a
enjoyable
beer
it
comes
across
like
a
pale
ale
in
a
pils
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
big
soapy
white
head
settles
to
a
thin

i
am
normally
not
a
big
fan
of
the
pale
yellows
but
this
brew
is
certainly
more
interesting
than
most
its
greatest
asset
is
something
that
might
not
appeal
to
everyone
its
bitterness
i
think
that
what
happened
was
sn
used
their
torpedo
hop
rocket
using
noble
hops
and
the
result
was
more
straightup
hop
bitterness
than
people
are
accustomed
to
i
like
it
it
reminds
me
of
the
highly
rated
victory
prima
pils
without
the
metallic
taste
great
beer
for
sessioning
and
would
be
excellent
with
food
a
solid
pils
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
aroma
is
muted

not
up
to
sierra
nevadas
standard
very
refreshing
i
like
it
more
than
helles
because
its
got
more
hop
forward
aroma
and
flavour
too
bad
its
much
more
expensive
and
rarely
available
in
croatia
compared
to
german
and
czech
lagers
because
for
surely
id
buy
it
often
especially
in
summer
crisp
summer
lager
a
step
above
the
popular
macro
beers
not
enough
edge
for
a
really
high
rating
overall
a
tasty
pilsner
very
light
good
to
drink
with
food
or
in
the
early
afternoon
nice
carbonation
and
no
offensive
flavors
if
you
can
get
nooner
though
i
suggest
you
get
it
instead
i
honestly
cant
remember
when
i
last
had
a
pilsner
and
i
tried
this
after
an
afternoon
of
stouts
and
black
ipas
so
prolly
not
the
best
time
to
have
had
it
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
taste
is
better
than
your
average
pilsner
and
it
was
refreshing
enough
not
sure
if
i
would
purchase
again
but
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
drainpour
for
me
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
but
i
remember
it
being
crisp
like
a
summer
beer
should
be
and
just
bitter
enough
that
it
had
some
unique
character
to
it
to
set
it
apart
from
other
summer
brews
overall
a
better
example
than
most
american
breweries
make
as
far
as
pilsners
go
i
would
like
to
have
a
drier
example
with
less
honey
sweetness
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
again
but
i
know
now
that
it
is
not
going
to
satisfy
my
thirst
for
a
good
dry
hoppy
pils
tastes
like
a
summer
beer
a
good
and
citrusy
one
at
that
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
leaves
trails
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
light
but
with
scents
of
orange
peel
and
a
very
dry
hop
scent
the
taste
was
exceptionally
clean
and
refreshing
would
definitely
recommend
getting
another

really
you

buy
a

or
even
a

save

some

now
to

all
these

i
cant
believe

took
me
so
long
to
finally
try
this
beer
i
can
definatly
see
myself
having
one
of
these
outside
on
a
hot
day
overall
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
so
far
great
balance
and
flavor
between
pilsner
malts
and
the
nice
kick
of
floral
hops
at
the
end
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
thats

this
is
a
light
and
fun
beer
overall
very
fresh
and
crisp
and
it
goes
down
well
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
and
spotty
lace
the
smell
is
grass
cracker
funky
yeast
the
taste
is
sweet
pale
malt
corn
light
hop
light
body
this
is
a
nice
crisp
beer
but
really
only
slightly
more
flavor
then
budweiser
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
pilsner
style
and
this
isnt
a
great
one
pours
from
the
bottle
a
pale
gold
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
leaves
quickly
it
smells
of
hay
grain
and
spice
this
carries
over
to
the
taste
along
with
a
light
bit
of
citrus
some
sweet
notes
too
its
fairly
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
pleasing
amount
of
carbonation
its
not
quite
as
substantial
as
a
traditional
pils
but
is
nearly
perfect
for
a
summer
lager
overall
this
is
a
good
pilsner
i
would
call
it
another
winner
from
sierra
nevada
it
lacks
the
gritty
grainy
grassy
taste
you
get
at
the
finish
of
most
pilsners
but
that
might
be
a
positive
for
you
i
however
took
off
a
few
points
for
that
nonetheless
i
think
you
would
find
this
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
do
d
the
appearance
and
aroma
components
are
average
at
best
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
components
are
really
really
good
the
end
result
is
a
very
enjoyable
summer
offering
in
the
form
of
a
czech
pilsner
sierra
nevada
turns
out
solid
beer
after
solid
beer
and
this
one
is
no
exception
worthy
of
a
six
pack
each
and
every
summer
m
medium
to
high
carbonation
expected
from
this
style
finishes
very
crisp
but
starts
very
dry
overall
not
as
flavorful
as
mamas
little
yella
pils
but
certainly
better
than
heineken
aboveaverage
pilsner
though
i
think
it
should
be
rated
as
an
american
pilsner
not
czech
honestly
for
the
need
this
fulfills
a
part
of
me
would
rather
just
by
a
less
expensive
aal
i
am
from
germany
and
i
love
german
beers
this
one
for
me
is
probably
the
closest
usbrewed
beer
i
have
found
to
a
good
bavarian
beer
i
love
it
just
wish
theyd
switch
from
those
tiny
bottles
to
regular
0
5l
ones
too
bad
its
neither
easy
to
find
here
in
md
nor
particularly
cheap
but
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
bright
straw
colored
beer
with
soapy
head
really
bready
smell
some
caramel
and
malts
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
tones
of
biscuit
and
black
pepper
spice
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
creamy
buttery
i
actually
prefer
this
beer
to
any
of
the
classic
czech
pilners
and
look
for
it
every
year
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonals
overall
this
one
is
going
in
my
bar
as
my
lager
so
long
as
sierra
keeps
brewing
it
i
will
support
them
if
we
ever
want
to
challenge
the
inbevs
of
the
world
we
have
to
support
the
smaller
breweries
when
they
roll
out
a
lager
clean
taste
and
refreshing
i
wouldve
liked
a
bit
more
malt
backbone
in
the
beer
overall
a
very
good
summertime
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
o
a
decent
choice
for
a
lawnmower
brew
especially
since
it
now
comes
in
cans
however
not
one
of
my
favorite
sierra
nevada
beers
or
pilseners
ill
take
the
kellerweis
over
this
for
a
yard
work
libation
any
day
of
the
week
overall
this
is
a
terrific
pilsner
id
have
this
during
any
season
but
its
certainly
great
as
a
summer
seasonal
o
cant
say
id
try
it
again
unless
my
other
options
were
all
light
beers
thats
just
me
being
honest
overall
a
greatly
earned
3
5
for
sierra
nevada
summerfest
lager
from
sierra
nevada
brewing
co
this
is
one
the
easiest
drinking
nonmacro
lagers
ive
ever
had
which
is
certainly
not
to
say
this
brew
is
void
of
character
quite
the
contrary
this
is
gonna
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
the
rest
of
this
seasom
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
get
it
for
a
hot
day
as
it
is
better
than
other
similar
summer
beers
i
have
had
as
far
as
pale
lagers
go
this
beers
got
it
all
its
crisp
dry
chalky
lemony
with
hints
of
grass
theres
even
some
tangelo
mid
palate
perfect
balance
of
sweetness
and
noble
hops
both
of
which
are
lightly
done
delicious
and
refreshing
o
a
nice
summer
beer
itll
go
down
fast
not
complex
but
its
not
intended
to
be
a
nice
hot
weather
beer
o
surprised
how
pleasant
this
beer
is
most
american
attempts
at
a
czech
pilsner
that
ive
had
has
always
had
an
off
flavor
but
this
is
clean
and
very
similar
to
pilsner
urquell
forget
your
american
wheats
and
fruit
flavor
extract
beers
this
is
what
id
like
to
have
in
the
ridge
at
all
times
during
the
summer
wish
i
could
find
it
in
cans
o
eh
very
unoffensive
which
wins
it
points
in
my
book
since
a
lot
of
the
czech
pilsners
ive
had
in
the
past
have
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
while
this
one
certainly
isnt
super
satisfying
at
least
theres
nothing
there
to
turn
me
off
from
drinking
the
whole
thing
o
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
brew
thus
the
lower
scores
as
a
fan
of
sierra
nevadas
ipa
styles
i
think
i
will
stick
to
those
from
now
on
but
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
after
a
long
days
work
i
guess
one
could
call
it
a
starter
beer
for
someone
looking
to
get
into
microbrews
very
nice
well
balanced
lager
flavorful
but
not
with
the
skunkynes
or
bitter
that
you
expect
from
a
classic
czech
lager
hints
of
citric
add
a
nice
touch
of
summer
not
a
lot
of
co2
but
on
a
hot
day
you
would
drink
it
right
down
before
it
went
flat
actually
pretty
jazzed
ab
out
this
beer
and
will
make
it
my
summer
session
beer
overall
a
clean
refreshing
beer
with
all
the
right
pilsner
elements
awesome
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
hot
weather
its
90
degrees
out
today
and
this
sure
hit
the
spot
this
has
always
been
a
goodie
from
sierra
nevada
pours
a
medium
straw
color
wit
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
dissipates
to
wisps
of
foam
on
the
top
spicy
floral
hop
aroma
with
a
light
biscuity
malt
base
the
flavor
is
crisp
crackery
bready
malts
with
plenty
of
spicy
hops
to
counter
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
nice
hoppy
light
pilsener
beer
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
sierra
nevada
summerfest
another
offering
from
this
brewer
that
everybody
seems
to
like
but
i
just
havent
found
that
beer
they
make
that
tingles
my
toes
for
this
one
i
found
it
runofthemill
when
it
came
to
its
appearance
although
it
did
pour
a
nice
head
with
lacing
the
odor
was
okay
as
well
as
the
mouthfeel
having
a
decent
crispness
about
it
the
taste
was
definitely
the
best
part
of
the
beer
and
at
least
that
left
me
thinking
theres
probably
an
offering
to
look
forward
too
beautiful
golden
straw
color
on
the
pour
wispy
white
finger
of
head
nose
is
grassy
lemony
somewhat
herbal
but
im
not
getting
much
spice
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bite
to
balance
out
the
bready
malt
a
refreshing
american
lager
a
well
made
lager
with
great
characteristics
of
a
european
lager
if
you
enjoy
beers
like
stella
artois
heineken
try
out
this
great
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
oeasy
drinking
summer
beer
a
solid
draft
lager
choice
not
my
favorite
beer
i
like
bitter
beers
as
much
as
the
next
person
but
this
one
for
me
anyway
is
bitter
without
having
enough
flavor
the
smell
is
nice
looks
nice
but
is
just
too
bitter
for
me
i
love
dark
beers
and
i
love
a
deep
dark
flavor
but
i
found
this
to
be
just
bitter
without
too
much
taste
i
definitely
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
poolside
in
summer
o
a
great
czech
pilsner
incredibly
drinkable
and
well
balanced
would
love
to
see
more
pilsners
from
sierra
nevada
spot
on
bright
yellow
in
color
with
good
clarity
poured
with
a
dense
white
foam
that
reduced
to
a
creamy
cap
fresh
floral
hop
grass
and
light
lemon
zest
aromas
with
a
definitive
biscuity
malt
backbone
medium
bodied
with
assertive
refreshing
palate
cleansing
carbonation
fresh
light
citrus
hop
flavor
up
front
that
quickly
transitioned
to
floral
and
tangy
lightly
spicy
hops
through
the
middle
strong
biscuity
malt
backbone
throughout
spicy
hop
flavors
quickly
subsided
at
the
end
as
this
finished
crisply
and
dryly
with
a
lingering
biscuity
malt
and
hop
bitterness
overall
i
could
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
lot
of
these
i
normally
drink
ipas
and
belgian
styles
but
i
do
like
to
have
a
good
lager
on
hand
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
quite
nicely
win
overall
wow
this
is
such
a
great
freakin
beer
and
what
makes
it
like
so
many
other
great
beers
is
its
sublime
balance
between
the
hop
bite
malt
sweetness
and
creamy
feel
no
its
flavor
isnt
incredibly
complex
its
strength
is
in
its
subtlety
and
harmony
this
one
is
so
easy
to
knock
back
its
ridiculous
perfect
for
a
summer
day
or
hell
any
day
sn
killed
it
with
this
one
and
ill
definitely
be
bummed
when
its
gone
for
the
year
its
an
outstanding
beer
overall
this
beer
is
an
extremely
underrated
offering
from
sierra
nevada
primarily
due
to
the
style
the
czech
pils
style
like
other
light
lager
styles
showcases
subtleties
in
the
malts
and
hops
and
this
brew
does
just
that
youre
not
browbeaten
with
hops
but
the
beer
isnt
thin
and
bland
like
macro
lagers
this
is
an
extremely
wellcrafted
summer
beer
which
is
refreshing
and
flavorful
the
perfect
beer
for
grilling
would
highly
recommend
especially
for
fans
of
czech
and
german
pils
overall
most
excellent
compares
equally
with
czech
pilsners
overall
this
beer
screams
summer
one
cant
beat
the
price
so
every
year
ive
been
nabbing
at
least
a
sixer
of
it
for
a
good
long
time
of
my
beer
drinking
life
overall
i
love
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
perfect
beer
for
those
long
summer
days
spent
out
in
the
sun
very
approachable
and
sessionable
will
be
a
standby
for
me

expected

to

definitely
good
for
a
lager
i
was
expecting
more
citrus
notes
but
i
cant
detect
any
its
a

watery
but
i
guess
that
is
to
be
expected
of
this
style
found
at

a

a

a

a
small
amount

the
aroma
is
equally
mild
with
light
notes
of

the
taste
is
also
mild
but
not
lacking
in
any
way
nice
bread
with
a
mild
light
fruit
and
earthy
hops
it
has
a
light
body
and
a
crisp
finish
a
nice
lightbodied
fullflavored
lager
overall
a
highlyrecommended
u
s
based
lager
that
is
widely
available
i
look
forward
to
its
release
each
year
and
cant
wait
for
the
canned
version
to
hit
my
market
slowly
becoming
a
cantmiss
classic
in
my
book
pours
a
crystal
clear
very
light
amber
yellow
with
a
reasonable
head
laces
well
with
poor
retention
the
nose
is
almost
nonexistent
just
a
slight
yeast
fragrance
light
bodied
with
an
above
average
carbonation
level
the
flavor
profile
is
nice
but
not
complex
against
a
very
light
biscuit
background
sweetness
the
saaz
hop
is
noticeable
but
muted
the
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
with
a
nice
effervescence
that
flows
into
a
slight
bitterness
that
lingers
a
very
good
pilsener
but
not
in
the
same
league
as

that

this
is
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
though
with
a
decent

so
you
can
have
a
couple
without
getting
throwed
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
refreshing
no
overwhelming
or
out
of
balance
in
any
way
still
enough
oomph
to
stand
out
from
the
bmcs
yet
light
enough
to
fit
in
perfectly
well
at
a
barbecue
or
poolside
hooray
cans
ive
a
feeling
ill
be
drinking
plenty
of
this
all
summer
when
not
enjoying
home
brew
o
uncharacteristic
of
sierra
would
not
buy
again
but
overall
a
typical
pilsner
o
sierra
nevada
nails
the
style
i
could
drink
these
all
day
well
done
o
disappointed
with
the
brand
there
is
nothing
to
really
set
this
lager
apart
d
very
dirnkalbe
have
lots
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
working
for
it
yet
like
many
people
in
this
world
the
nose
needs
a
little
work
perhaps
it
was
this
certain
bottle
but
the
scent
was
not
very
appealing
but
the
other
characteristics
certainly
made
up
for
this
minor
issue
it
is
good
knowing
you
will
have
at
least
one
good
friend
to
spend
a
sunny
afternoon
with
this
is
a
very
good
american
pilsner
the
hop
profile
is
not
very
german
tasting
but
this
beer
gets
the
spirit
of
the
style
correct
regardless
this
is
because
the
mouthfeel
is
spoton
and
the
hops
function
in
the
same
way
as
a
traditional
pilsner
balancing
the
grassy
malts
with
a
spicy
but
never
overpowering
bitterness
another
good
offering
from
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
reliable
breweries
in
the
states
o
a
refreshing
highly
drinkable
lager
probably
more
suited
for
an
outside
summer
activity
quencher
than
a
sitting
on
the
couch
evening
beer
review
m
as
mentioned
before
starts
sweet
but
quickly
becomes
dry
and
crisp
at
the
finish
the
hops
provide
a
subtle
bitterness
that
is
easy
to
not
notice
since
the
beer
is
so
easy
to
sip
without
putting
much
thought
towards
the
taste
o
yeah
this
is
really
darned
good
every
part
of
this
contributes
to
a
whole
that
is
more
than
the
sum
a
very
good
expression

this
may
not
be
the
beer
geeks
dream
but
its
a
good
sessionable
beer
overall
not
a
drain
pour
but
not
a
great
beer
i
think
they
were
going
for
a
unique
complex
lager
but
the
flavors
just
werent
great
not
terrible
for
the
summer
but
i
wouldnt
buy
again
overall
very
drinkable
hits
the
spot
as
most
decentgood
pilsners
are
flavor
profile
was
nothing
to
beat
home
about
but
definitely
a
beer
id
bring
over
as
a
gateway
for
those
among
us
who
are
a
little
less
adventurous
overall
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
pilsners
i
have
had
in
a
while
but
that
is
coming
from
a
small
number
o
crisp
lager
with
a
good
bitter
hop
ending
a
quality
pils
that
would
fly
in
cz
overall
nicely
crafted
beer
with
some
good
citrus
and
hops
that
provide
a
good
refreshing
beer
but
there
are
other
summer
beers
that
i
like
much
better
o
an
easily
drinkable
beer
the
style
is
a
bit
americanized
but
nothing
wrong
with
that
o
solid
pilsener
that
is
great
to
have
around
during
the
summer
inexpensive
available
in
cans
clean
taste
what
more
do
you
want
wonderful
usually
im
a
pretty
big
sierra
nevada
guy
but
they
couldve
been
more
imaginative
here
for
a
summer
the
pilsner
is
good
as
far
as
pilsner
are
concerned
straw
golden
color
goes
down
very
easy
no
frills
there
is
a
very
clean
finish
that
is
nice
and
makes
it
easy
to
have
with
food
just
somewhat
boring
a
really
nice
summer
lager
and
thirst
quencher
the
hop
bitterness
aspect
really
shines
through
yet
the
light
grain
flavors
hold
their
own
in
the
background
this
all
makes
for
a
wellbalanced
easy
drinking
beer
o
keeping
in
perspective
its
purpose
its
just
fine
not
necessarily
a
memorable
experience
but
good
for
outdoor
hot
weather
when
heavier
stuff
wont
do
o
this
is
a
good
summer
drink
but
i
cant
see
preferring
it
over
a
hefe
for
my
palate
it
just
strikes
me
as
a
little
off
not
a
normal
lager
some
alelike
flavorings
but
a
pilsner
format
its
a
good
combination
but
not
my
favorite
o
this
summer
seasonal
goes
down
easy
my
number
one
beer
so
far
in
my
quest
for
the
ultimate
summer
beer
of
2013
this
is
what
all
those
american
adjunct
lagers
masquerading
as
pilsners
wish
they
could
one
day
grow
up
to
be
i
know
this
beer
is
listed
as
a
czech
pilsner
but
in
my
mind
it
is
a
classic
american
summer
in
a
bottle
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
was
an
enjoyable
drink
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
but
flavorful
enough
to
make
it
actually
worth
drinking
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
a
try
overall
a
solid
if
unremarkable
lager
great
for
a
warm
summer
afternoon
o
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
the
summer
im
enjoying
this
one
while
im
making
and
grilling
up
some
burgers
overall
little
low
in
the
taste
area
but
a
great
drinkable
summer
beer
the
actual
beer
was
good
othis
is
a
pretty
good
slambythepool
type
beer
and
a
wonderful
choice
for
those
who
think
they
like
macro
or
aal
and
are
scared
by
craft
my
complaints
include
a
lackluster
appearance
where
is
the
head
and
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
for
my
preference
in
a
pils
this
is
a
crisp
beer
with
subtle
hops
with
a
good
amount
of
drying
on
the
end
unfortunately
not
much
flavor
in
this
one
its
a
bit
toned
down
even
for
a
pilsner
i
do
prefer
the
true
german
or
czech
versions
of
this
beer
but
still
decent
overall
i
guess
i
just
cant
see
the
good
side
of
any
lager
unless
its
a
doppelbock
or
something
but
this
one
was
better
than
bmc
and
id
rather
have
had
this
than
a
glass
of
water
its
just
not
very
pleasant
or
enjoyable
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
crisp
smooth
and
clean
an
above
average
pilsener
which
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
im
not
sure
if
i
would
seek
this
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
either
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
to
lively
amount
of
carbonation
this
brew
is
light
crisp
refreshing
and
overall
clean
and
enjoyable
certainly
a
summertime
offering
worth
checking
out
that
is
fitting
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
fits
perfectly
with
its
summertime
label
smooth
clean
crisp
refreshing
all
good
qualities
in
the
midwestern
summer
heat
you
could
take
this
fishing
session
it
very
versatile
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
good
overall
a
nice
beer
i
might
buy
it
again
at
some
point
although
i
usually
go
for
something
a
little
darker
or
with
more
of
a
kick
but
this
was
refreshing
and
a
fitting
compliment
to
my
hot
humid
apartment
stm
just
a
solid
example
of
the
style
bright
grassy
herbal
hops
backed
up
by
a
bready
malt
backbone
and
finishing
crisp
and
clean
with
a
bit
of
spice
light
to
medium
body
lively
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with
plenty
of
flavor
i
will
continue
my
search
for
my
summer
beer
the
verdict
not
bad
as
advertised
it
is
a
crisp
summer
lager
but
theres
not
much
more
to
it
than
that
it
does
have
the
signature
sierra
nevada
quality
but
lacks
the
great
flavor
of
many
of
their
brews
in
this
one
case
i
prefer
winter
over
summer
their
celebration
ipa
is
worth
waiting
for
every
winter
shared
a
taster
ontap
as
part
of
four
flights
at
the
brewery
sierra
nevada
brewing
co
chico
usa
as
part
of
a
sixweek
west
coast
beer
tour
i
rate
to
taste
not
to
style
see
my
blog
for
more
details
carbeers
wordpress
com
of
all
the
summer
pilsenerkolsch
options
here
in
texas
im
not
sure
where
this
one
ranks
but
its
a
cantgowrong
choice
because
its
mighty
good
overall
theres
no
denying
that
this
is
a
goodquality
czech
pilsner
as
one
would
expectr
from
sierra
nevada
i
would
imagine
it
would
probably
be
worthwhile
in
the
u
s
too
but
at
over
au85
a
case
of
24
the
price
is
completely
unreasonable
o
a
decent
pilsener
that
i
will
certainly
sample
again
on
tap
probably
wont
buy
this
in
a
6er
but
will
certainly
enjoy
in
the
future
great
summer
beer
that
isnt
gimmicky
a
crisp
and
refreshing
pilsener
highly
recommend
o
great
summer
brew
m
nice
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
i
really
like
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
and
it
is
my
go
to
beer
when
i
want
something
with
a
little
bite
and
bitterness
i
think
they
should
stick
with
what
they
know
how
to
brew
and
stay
away
from
doing
a
lager
in
the
future
i
am
still
perplexed
though
at
what
so
many
people
find
appealing
about
this
lager
it
is
a
lot
more
consistent
in
taste
than
that
of
the
bottle
you
can
definitely
experience
more
of
a
full
flavor
whereas
the
bottled
version
is
a
lot
more
mellow
ive
had
this
beer
on
draft
as
well
and
being
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
lagers
i
was
also
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
in
any
of
its
forms
i
find
that
the
taste
is
too
bitter
as
if
licking
a
mahogany
wood
post
i
just
cant
grasp
the
bitterness
and
wish
that
there
was
more
to
offer
in
terms
of
its
flavor
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
summer
lager
looks
great
and
smells
great
the
flavor
is
very
balanced
and
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
would
session
this
easily
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
on
a
hot
day
this
would
be
tough
to
beat
overall
though
it
is
pretty
standard
for
the
style
has
some
light
lemon
and
citrus
notes
that
deviate
it
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
but
overall
it
is
a
nice
clean
refreshing
pilsner
perhaps
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
was
not
disappointed
but
i
would
be
interested
to
try
it
on
tap
it
appears
a
golden
yellow
carbonation
is
good
smells
a
of
cereal
and
barley
with
a
hint
of
citrus
background
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
regards
to
cereal
like
quality
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
balanced
bitter
finish
a
nicely
balanced
lager
on
the
palate
and
a
light
body
characteristic
to
lagers
being
the
third
year
ive
had
this
beer
in
a
row
i
feel
as
though
this
years
batch
is
a
little
more
bitter
than
before
but
the
balance
is
there
it
lacks
complexity
a
fine
lager
nonetheless
a
damn
good
pilsner
i
am
not
a
to
big
a
fan
of
czech
pilsners
and
have
always
shyed
away
from
them
this
one
is
an
exception
though
i
will
drink
these
over
any
mainstream
brew
any
day
of
the
week
flavorcrisp
and
satisfying
i
give
this
beer
a
good
grade
because
i
think
they
capture
the
style
well
without
going
totally
overboard
with
the
hops
o
i
happened
to
have
this
beer
on
a
relatively
cool
night
while
grilling
up
some
bbq
chicken
but
ive
also
had
it
playing
lawn
games
on
a
hot
afternoon
i
find
it
to
be
a
refreshing
break
from
my
ipas
and
always
look
forward
to
this
one
despite
my
hangups
on
the
style
overall
3
50
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
i
like
lagers
but
am
certainly
not
enamored
with
the
style
however
this
beer
is
thirstquenching
and
a
delicious
representation
of
what
a
lager
can
be
this
is
a
goto
for
the
warmer
months
a
beer
interesting
enough
to
enjoy
yet
simple
enough
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
overall
im
liking
it
a
lot
pick
it
up
at
your
local
grocer
for
13
99
a
twelve
i
you
can
o
a
crisp
refreshing
offering
from
sierra
nevada
doesnt
blow
my
mind
but
its
a
very
well
done
summer
lagerpilsener
excellent
to
drink
with
food
good
daydrinking
session
beer
not
my
favorite
from
sierra
nevada
but
appropriate
for
the
summer
overall
a
decent
pils
but
to
be
honest
they
all
taste
the
same
to
me
if
you
want
a
great
czech
pilsener
nothing
will
beat
a
staropramen
straight
from
prague
i
would
buy
one
of
those
of
this
or
any
other
light
lagerpilsener
anyday
with
that
said
this
is
a
well
balanced
brew
that
i
would
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
overall
a
tasty
pilsner
that
is
as
the
name
suggests
perfect
for
the
summer
a
lot
more
spice
than
i
had
anticipated
seems
to
come
from
both
the
yeast
and
the
hop
nothing
special
to
speak
about
a
subpar
czech
pils
best
way
i
can
describe
this
is
as
lemony
hops
corn
pops
subtle
grains
i
mean
this
in
the
best
way
possible
a
good
refresher
and
a
good
alternative
to
a
thicker
sam
summer
or
something
else
with
too
much
hoppy
dryness
making
the
refreshment
just
out
of
reach
overall
this
is
a
great
lawnmower
beer
perfect
for
those
hot
days
out
in
the
sun
if
your
looking
for
something
that
is
going
to
be
brimming
with
taste
this
one
is
a
little
subdued
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
though
edit
had
a
few
more
since
the
review
its
growing
on
me
the
summerfest
is
pretty
good
but
ive
found
that
like
a
fine
wine
you
need
to
let
it
breathe
so
the
yeast
oxigenates
and
mixes
its
lightly
carbonated

an
easydrinking
brighttasting
lager
complex
enough
to
please
my
palate
but
refreshing
and
light
enough
to
throw
back
a
few
recommended
to
be
continued
overall
not
a
bad
pilsner
but
the
bitterness
lingered
around
way
too
long
still
enjoyable
and
definitely
a
warm
sunny
day
beer
ok
beer
but
not
a
great
one
drink
fast
o
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
beer
o
good
summer
beer
just
not
for
me
this
is
a
tasty
very
easy
to
drink
beer
its
well
balanced
and
quite
refreshing
overall
this
is
one
of
the
few
summer
style
beers
that
i
still
enjoy
and
will
revisit
year
to
year
along
with
anchor
summer
and
harpoon
summer
it
is
the
perfect
pairing
for
anything
from
a
backyward
bbq
to
a
nice
dinner
of
asian
or
spanish
cuisine
not
overly
complex
but
above
average
flavor
wise
for
the
style
o
not
a
bad
summer
brew
at
all
def
noticeable
skunk
typical
of
the
czech
pilsner
but
with
a
slight
addition
of
citrus
would
def
get
this
again
o
a
great
summer
beer
from
sierra
nevada
crisp
light
flavorful
and
highly
drinkable
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
day
o
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
for
a
weekend
afternoon
preferable
with
90
degrees
temperatures
tasty
a
quality
lager
the
flavouraroma
is
subtle
but
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
good
malt
and
the
hop
aroma
has
a
citrus
edge
to
it
an
unmistakeable
sn
aroma
lurks
in
the
background
perhaps
the
yeast
strain
at
any
rate
worthy
of
your
time
grab
one
if
you
see
it
this
beer
pours
a
light
straw
with
a
massive
4
finger
soapy
head
that
never
quite
goes
away
substantial
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
smell
is
very
subtle
but
i
picked
up
apples
fruits
and
a
floral
aroma
mouthfeel
is
excellent
with
lots
of
carbonation
taste
is
malt
and
fruit
well
balanced
with
nice
hops
on
the
finish
i
recommend
this
one
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
great
session
beer
on
a
warmer
day
it
has
a
nice
lighteryet
pronounced
enough
hop
flavor
to
make
for
a
crisp
refreshing
flavorful
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
pilsner
style
lagers
i
have
ever
had
from
an
american
brewery
i
wish
that
it
was
a
year
round
offering
the
kick
back
on
a
summer
night
thing
i
think
is
more
about
marketing
than
anything
it
is
easy
drinking
but
still
quite
complex
if
you
are
accustomed
to
huge
ipas
or
stouts
this
may
seem
like
a
beginner
beer
however
this
can
stand
next
to
any
pilsner
in
the
world
and
command
respect
this
is
no
adjunct
lager
o
very
drinkable
but
complex
just
like
sierras
nevada
does
it
i
like
the
style
as
well
as
their
other
brews
too
bad
i
took
so
long
to
try
this
would
have
been
a
session
beer
for
me
a
very
unique
summer
ale
for
those
trying
to
deviate
from
the
norm
delicate
quietly
complex
not
outstanding
but
a
decent
and
refreshing
rendition
o
sierra
nevada
summerfest
is
an
enjoyable
summer
lager
that
will
quench
your
thirst
nothing
outstanding
but
solidly
put
together
o
a
solid
beer
to
stock
your
fridge
with
in
the
summertime
its
refreshing
quality
and
low
abv
mean
even
a
12pack
of
this
wouldnt
stick
around
too
long
o
this
is
a
decent
overall
lager
sure
there
are
many
lagers
i
would
rather
have
but
this
beats
the
big
american
beers
any
day
it
is
light
and
refreshing
to
drink
on
a
summer
day
if
you
had
them
lying
around
final
thoughts
i
cant
wait
until
summer
comes
to
an
end
and
breweries
start
pushing
their
fall
and
winter
seasonals
that
being
said
this
was
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
pilsener
style
in
fact
it
almost
tastes
like
more
of
a
summer
ale
which
is
definitely
what
they
were
going
for
poured
this
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
its
a
very
clear
gold
with
a
very
white
head
that
settles
down
into
a
cap
over
a
couple
minutes
carbonation
is
relatively
sedate
nose
contains
the
usual
suspects
faint
lemon
honey
grass
for
a
pilsner
the
nose
isnt
so
spicy
the
taste
is
great
floral
and
crisp
and
it
has
a
nice
bittersweet
balance
like
any
good
summertime
lager
very
crisp
and
leaves
me
wanting
another
sip
given
the
right
setting
hangin
out
on
the
roof
with
some
friends
and
lawn
chairs
on
a
sunny
day
for
instance
this
beer
would
be
absolutely
perfect
love
this
beer
in
the
summer
time
golden
color
light
crisp
hoppy
aroma
nothing
special
upfront
but
a
true
delight
to
drink
its
got
a
mild
hop
kick
to
save
it
from
being
an
ordinary
pilsener
and
goes
down
nice
and
easy
a
fantastic
session
beer
for
those
summer
nights
with
friends
this
is
an
underrated
beer
and
an
underrated
style
c
cheers
o
a
surprising
offering
from
sn
at
least
as
far
as
im
concerned
due
to
the
subtle
use
of
hops
rather
than
the
cascadian
avalanche
that
ive
come
to
expect
this
is
a
a
clean
refreshing
beer
that
is
great
fr
a
summers
day

the
beer
is
crisp
as
described
and
it
has
just
enough
citrus
to
make
it
interesting
this
beer
does
not
make
the
common
seasonal
mistake
of
overpowering
the
drinker
with
gimmicky
flavors
overall
it
is
a
light
and
refreshing
brew
that
has
good
carbonation
and
is
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
that
you
can
drink
during
your
bbq
or
on
your
pool
deck
and
not
get
sick
of
it
in
a
marketplace
full
of
crappy
breweries
looking
to
make
a
buck
during
the
summer
sierra
nevada
comes
through
with
an
offering
that
is
different
refreshing
and
never
lets
you
forget
that
you
are
drinking
a
beer
o
not
impressed
with
this
it
is
refreshing
though
it
delivers
on
the
promise
printed
on
the
label
crisp
summer
lager
good
thing
the
label
doesnt
say
outstanding
pilsner
flavor
like
you
have
never
seen
before
because
then
it
would
be
lying
it
tastes
fine
but
isnt
anything
special
easily
sessionable
and
if
i
went
to
a
friends
house
and
they
offered
me
one
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
o
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
have
this
again
oi
will
definitely
try
this
again
as
this
is
now
the
leading
candidate
for
my
summer
seasonal
beerlight
but
flavorful
o
good
summer
beer
goes
well
with
everything
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
easily
sessionable
and
drinkable
wellbalanced
and
easy
on
the
palate
a
great
summer
beer
with
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
behind
it
o
this
is
a
really
nice
pilsner
and
a
great
summer
beer
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
does
sierra
nevada
really
make
anything
less
than
good
beers
o
i
had
initially
gotten
bad
macro
lager
taste
and
cardboard
out
of
this
but
later
in
the
pack
i
got
a
pretty
good
flavor
a
sweetish
kind
of
malt
and
overall
was
just
pretty
tasty
i
wonder
what
the
difference
was
the
first
four
or
five
were
just
nothing
beers
but
now
im
on
board
weird
great
for
the
heat
wave
we
are
currently
stuck
in
as
this
is
refreshing
yet
full
flavored
o
i
love
this
beer
and
buy
it
by
the
case
in
summer
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
grab
some
even
my
sierra
nevada
hating
friends
like
this
one
this
is
a
beer
for
everyone
even
bmc
folk
will
enjoy
onice
clean
well
balanced
pilsner
go
to
beer
for
the
summer
time
o
not
quite
up
to
par
with
the
european
pilseners
but
a
good
effort
o
disappointing
translation
of
the
style
the
hops
really
dont
push
through
enough
to
give
this
beer
that
nice
crisp
edge
that
really
defines
the
czech
pilsners
i
dont
see
how
this
beer
gets
low
scores
when
comparing
it
to
other
beers
of
the
style
or
even
comparing
it
to
other
related
styles
its
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
awesome
smell
awesome
taste
just
great
all
around
i
do
have
one
major
problem
with
it
though
the
head
is
horrible
almost
as
bad
as
corona
ugh
it
is
only
about
14inch
and
dies
after
one
sip
i
am
pretty
unfamiliar
with
beer
but
ive
been
doing
the
45
degree
pour
and
keep
getting
horrible
foam
the
foam
is
one
of
the
things
i
love
about
beer
and
its
not
there
sad
because
their
pale
ale
has
an
excellent
head
and
is
my
favorite
beer
i
dont
know
if
pilseners
require
a
special
pour
or
what
but
this
is
still
a
favorite
slightly
above
average
an
easy
drinker
that
has
some
amount
of
flavor
to
it
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
very
good
beer
when
you
want
a
quality
pils
no
part
is
a
standout
but
together
they
all
mix
to
become
a
somewhat
unique
beer
its
like
voltron
for
your
mouth
sierra
nevada
summerfest
is
a
perfect
pick
for
those
who
seek
out
a
refreshing
lager
that
is
balanced
no
frills
no
thrills
just
a
clean
lager
with
a
nice
dry
spicy
finish
o
meh
i
wouldnt
buy
it
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
certainly
many
other
pilsners
out
there
i
would
rather
have
one
of
the
few
efforts
from
sn
that
underwhelms
onot
as
good
as
some
other
summer
beers
ive
had
but
as
a
refrigerator
staple
for
hot
summer
days
its
hard
to
beat
it
drinks
like
water
in
a
good
way
and
really
hits
the
spot
very
easy
to
drink
escpecially
on
a
88
degree
night
like
tonight
its
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
has
plenty
of
taste
that
a
lot
of
summer
seasonal
beers
lack
o
not
offensive
but
with
significantly
less
character
than
other
craft
summer
seasonals
after
trying
other
summer
beers
this
is
not
particularly
compelling
probably
the
first
sn
beer
i
havent
been
impressed
with
o
good
for
cutting
the
grass
or
some
outdoor
activity
and
for
the
style
o
couldnt
tell
any
significant
difference
between
having
it
from
a
fresh
bottle
on
20120615
and
ontap
6
days
earlier
its
a
very
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
pils
thumbs
up
although
for
the
calories
and
flavor
id
rather
have
a
troegs
sunshine
pils
or
a
pilsner

o
excellent
summer
beer
perfect
for
the
beach
and
bbq
sierra
nevada
is
always
a
solid
choice
o
as
usual
sierra
nevada
does
not
disappoint
nicely
balanced
and
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
overall
the
sierra

is
a
great
beer
for
the
summertime
its
light
enough
in
body
to
be
refreshing
during
the
hot

taste

oa
decent
summer
beer
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
boring
overall
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
nice
summer
beer
subtle
american
hop
influence
while
still
maintaining
mostly
a
traditional
pils
feel
o
the
name
summerfest
suits
this
beer
perfectly
its
easy
to
drink
has
flavor
and
is
light
it
was
nice
to
try
but
i
will
stick
with
sierra
nevada
southern
hemisphere
for
the
summer
season
subaverage
summer
beer
which
is
a
bit
disappointing
considering
the
brand
of
sierra
nevada
certainly
a
good
sessionable
pilsner
that
wont
offend
the
masses
o
this
beer
appeared
flat
but
it
was
just
purchased
yesterday
other
then
that
it
wasnt
bad
it
had
a
nice
crisp
refreshing
taste
perfect
for
a
summer
beer
light
lemonycitrusy
taste
that
was
decently
balanced
with
the
hops
nice
beer
for
the
summer
i
definitely
like
it
a
little
bit
better
then
the
sams
summer
ale
i
wouldnt
pay
a
lot
at
a
bar
for
this
beer
but
its
decent
to
pick
up
for
its
price
not
something
id
drink
everyday
but
maybe
occasionally
during
the
summers
o
an
ok
pilsner
i
prefer
snpa
even
for
summer
hayward
abbey
rating
72
i
find
this
years
edition
2014
to
be
a
little
bit
lighter
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
than
previous
years
maybe
its
just
me
but
thats
how
it
seems
o
i
really
cant
get
over
how
much
better
this
beer
is
than
i
thought
this
might
become
a
summer
regular
for
me
deliciously
well
balanced
and
simple
overall
actually
a
very
satisfying
pilsner
i
would
gladly
have
this
again
especially
on
tap
like
this
drink
i
can
see
how
people
like
this
pretty
crisp
and
clean
step
up
from
an
aal
just
not
for
me
ov
evaluating
as
a
pilsner
it
fails
it
tastes
very
little
like
a
pilsner
as
a
beer
on
its
own
it
is
ok
until
you
factor
in
the
price
there
are
many
other
beers
that
can
give
you
a
similar
experience
not
sierra
nevadas
best
but
i
can
drink
more
than
one
cheers
o
a
pretty
good
pilsener
nothing
special
or
amazing
but
its
crisp
and
refreshing
and
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
it
isnt
bad
for
what
it
is
but
it
isnt
very
good
either
i
like
a
good
pilsner
every
now
and
then
but
i
prefer
them
with
less
dank
earthiness
and
more
zesty
tartness
still
its
quite
drinkable
refreshing
and
it
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
then
again
so
does
sns
kellerweis
which
is
100x
better
in
my
opinion
o
sn
does
it
again
this
is
an
extremely
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
pilsner
and
one
i
could
drink
all
the
time
cheers
o
overall
a
good
brew
o
just
too
light
grainy
and
watery
for
my
tastes
although
admittedly
i
may
just
not
be
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
at
least
you
can
taste
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
used
this
is
what
bmc
wishes
it
could
taste
like
o
a
decenttasting
lager
nice
pils
but
nothing
more
id
be
excited
to
see
sierra
nevada
try
something
thicker
in
the
lager
department
this
beer
pours
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
tall
amount
of
white
head
the
smell
and
the
taste
match
quite
well
this
beer
is
very
grainy
and
crisp
with
an
undeniable
character
from
the
lager
yeast
it
also
has
a
light
but
present
hop
character
which
helps
set
this
apart
its
easy
drinking
but
it
is
to
be
expected
a
nice
summer
beer
o
an
extremely
good
summer
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
great
beer
for
bbqs
and
another
great
beer
from
sn
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
pale
straw
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
there
are
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
is
pale
roasted
barley
malt
as
well
as
some
cracker
in
the
aroma
there
are
some
hops
in
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
bready
from
the
malts
and
the
hop
flavor
is
not
strong
there
is
some
mild
citrus
from
the
hops
but
this
is
not
very
noticeable
overall
this
is
pretty
basic
but
still
good
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
abundant
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
after
a
long
hot
day
have
a
few
bottles
of
these
chilled
for
your
summer
cookout
or
ready
for
you
after
you
mowed
your
lawn
taste
follows
the
nose
its
simple
and
seems
almost
underhopped
for
the
style
a
bit
bland
some
grassiness
but
feels
like
it
needs
a
sharper
hop
definition
and
bite
light
breadiness
some
floral
and
citrus
again
plainer
and
less
interesting
than
id
like
body
was
light
and
carbonation
medium
i
feel
like
this
might
be
one
of
those
beers
id
like
more
from
a
bottle
than
ontap
as
it
felt
smoother
and
less
bubbly
than
id
like
for
the
style
taking
away
from
the
crispness
and
refreshing
aspect
of
the
beer
a
perfect
pilsner
a
perfect
lager
a
perfect
beer
a
well
done
czech
pilsener
subtle
but
clean
crisp
flavors
easy
drinking
othis
brew
is
perfect
for
summer
days
i
drank
this
after
a
long
run
great
thirst
quencher
it
is
what
the
macrobrews
wish
they
were
refreshing
beer
to
have
at
a
bbq
some
brews
need
to
be
consumed
from
the
proper
glasssware
however
this
brew
can
be
enjoyed
right
out
of
the
bottle
or
a
glass
really
drinkable
this
beer
is
excellent
cheers
notes
good
to
push
macro
drinkers
to
a
quality
crisp
offering
not
my
thing
per
se
but
it
has
a
nice
profile
and
feels
rather
good
happy
mothers
day
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
summer
session
beer
and
for
good
reason
its
not
likely
to
wow
or
amaze
but
youd
be
hardpressed
to
beat
it
in
quality
and
drinkability
o
not
bad
seems
more
of
an
american
version
of
a
czech
pils
ie
appears
to
be
domestic
malts
i
prefer
the
continental
malts
with
this
style
after
smelling
the
beer
i
almost
threw
the
bottle
against
the
wall
embarrased
that
im
such
a
big
sierra
man
the
taste
changed
my
mind
this
is
a
light
and
easy
beer
to
drink
that
lets
me
enjoy
the
hops
beer
after
beer
s
pours
an
effervescent
dark
yellow
bubbles
continually
rising
to
the
surface
with
a
thumbs
width
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
just
a
little
while
got
the
earthy
haylike
lager
aroma
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
interesting
flavor
to
this
very
drinkable
a
nice
dose
of
malty
sweetness
that
has
me
thinking
of
the
sugar
from
fruit
some
hay
and
little
cereal
a
creamy
active
and
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
alright
beer
but
not
one
i
need
to
drink
again
im
glad
i
came
back
to
this
after
my
infatuation
with
extreme
beers
ended
its
a
nice
american
session
beer
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
light
golden
color
and
fizzy
smells
are
light
cereal
grains
and
light
white
grape
juice
the
taste
has
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
grains
and
crisp
hops
but
leans
toward
the
sweet
end
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
achieves
what
it
set
out
to
do
i
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
hop
flavor
however
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
12
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
and
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
slight
vegetal
notes
and
a
subdued
hop
presence
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
and
some
herbal
and
earthy
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
that
lingers
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
lager
that
is
nice
and
refreshing
for
the
hot
summer
months
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
the
style
it
had
some
good
pilsener
like
qualities
but
i
could
have
gone
without
the
lemon
zest
but
i
could
see
why
that
flavor
would
be
in
their
summer
beer
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
and
was
crisp
and
refreshing
but
its
a
little
to
bitter
for
me
to
want
to
drink
more
then
two
in
a
row
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
very
true
to
style
and
pretty
well
done
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
the
skunky
aroma
just
seemed
out
of
place
and
wasnt
needed
this
would
be
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
would
order
in
a
restaurant
because
it
seems
like
it
would
go
good
with
food
but
it
isnt
something
that
i
would
need
to
buy
another
six
pack
of
but
good
when
i
want
a
crisp
and
refreshing
brew
i
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
but
the
lemon
zest
might
not
be
for
everyone
and
i
wasnt
that
thrilled
about
it
as
far
as
sierra
nevada
beers
go
i
would
say
that
this
one
falls
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
not
that
interesting
even
though
it
has
some
additional
nontraditional
flavors
to
it
in
the
end
i
think
i
prefer
the
more
traditional
czech
pilseners
but
i
am
glad
i
gave
this
beer
a
shot
this
was
pretty
different
from
the
pale
wheat
ales
that
most
brewerys
market
as
their
summer
beer
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
o
this
tastes
like
what
i
wish
corona
or
other
macro
lagers
would
taste
like
so
refreshing
nice
pilsner
malt
character
lemon
and
spice
notes
very
drinkable
summer
beer
o
overall
a
refreshing
beer
for
those
summer
days
when
you
want
to
have
some
good
brews
but
not
overdo
it
these
would
pair
well
with
your
typical
bbq
fare
chicken
ribs
etc
to
me
this
is
what
the
macros
would
brew
if
they
actually
cared
or
better
yet
what
most
americans
would
want
from
their
beers
if
they
actually
cared
and
the
pilsener
style
really
was
the
beer
of
choice
maybe
in
100
years
everybody
will
be
drinking
pale
ales
or
something
this
is
what
i
would
consider
an
epic
fail
on
sierra
nevadas
part
if
they
were
looking
for
a
way
to
make
a
more
expensive
version
of
budweiser
then
they
have
succeeded
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
pilsner
from
a
brewery
known
more
for
their
hoppy
ales
a
great
hot
weather
brew
that
is
super
refreshing
and
low
on
the
abv
give
one
of
these
to
your
macro
drinking
friends
and
show
them
the
light
cheers
cheers
overall
a
very
nice
lager
something
to
pull
out
on
a
100
degree
day
with
some
real
flavor
just
another
fine
beer
from
the
guys
at
sierra
nevada
nothing
ground
breaking
but
always
well
above
average
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
bottled
date
of
2087
i
guess
sometime
in
march
this
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
grass
slight
hop
feel
is
medium
to
light
taste
is
good
enough
grain
some
grass
hops
on
tap
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
has
good
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma
is
biscuit
bread
a
light
mineral
note
some
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
the
initial
taste
has
a
light
sweetness
it
is
bready
with
earthy
notes
as
well
as
some
light
floral
hops
the
finish
is
a
bit
doughy
but
clean
and
dry
light
bodied
mediumhigh
carbonation
o
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
much
more
good
for
a
party
perhaps
t
very
light
and
definitely
pretty
drinkable
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
followed
by
a
lot
of
malt
and
grain
flavor
with
a
touch
of
breadiness
luckily
the
breadiness
never
overwhelmes
the
lighter
flavors
of
this
beer
and
it
remains
easy
to
drink
overall
now
this
is
a
lager
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
beers
of
this
style
dont
get
much
better
i
poured
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
into
a
glass
and
received
a
nice
two
finger
thick
white
head
of
foam
the
head
faded
quick
but
left
some
decent
lacing
the
color
was
a
nice
clear
golden
tint
the
aroma
to
me
starts
off
with
citrus
and
grass
notes
from
the
hops
fading
to
some
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
crisp
with
the
bready
malt
and
citrus
and
grass
of
the
malt
taking
equal
share
of
the
flavor
there
was
no
discernible
metallic
notes
like
on
euro
pilsners
or
lagers
the
mouthfeel
was
nicely
carbonated
and
light
as
to
be
expected
from
a
pilsner
over
all
this
seasonal
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
while
it
isnt
outstanding
it
is
very
solid
very
crisp
and
very
refreshing
too
bad
this
one
isnt
a
year
round
brew
i
always
look
forward
to
this
offering
its
a
very
clean
and
refined
beer
o
nice
refreshing
pilsener
above
average
o
a
good
drinkable
pilsner
there
are
definitely
worse
examples
of
this
not
incredibly
interesting
but
very
easy
to
go
through
a
six
of
this
on
a
hot
day
very
nice
taste
as
well
a
very
refreshing
summer
beer
with
a
little
more
flavor
than
its
peers
pours
a
see
through
blonde
color
with
a
very
prominent
thick
foaming
white
head
into
a
pilsner
glass
smells
like
a
traditional
pils
bready
malts
and
balanced
earthy
hops
this
one
has
a
little
bit
of
fruit
in
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
too
but
without
being
sweet
or
even
distracting
its
almost
like
lemongrass
in
it
but
its
not
quite
strong
enough
to
place
exactly
love
the
malt
profile
on
this
one
its
got
plenty
of
flavor
some
zest
and
gives
a
medium
body
to
an
otherwise
very
light
beer
great
carbonation
makes
it
down
easy
a
great
summer
session
beer
for
those
who
need
a
bit
more
happening
not
bad
at
all
sweet
pale
malt
and
earthy
hops
neither
is
overpowering
and
flavors
balance
out
very
well
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
refreshing
and
finishes
semidry
its
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
summers
day
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
many
of
the
other
standard
pilsners
available
and
i
enjoyed
the
beer
2012
edition
in
the
12
oz
bottle
from
trader
joes
overall
quite
nicelight
and
refreshing
very
subtle
flavours
but
if
you
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
it
becomes
very
enjoyable
o
a
solid
beer
i
would
put
it
just
slightly
under
sa
noble
pils
but
i
look
forward
to
a
sixer
of
this
every
year

o
great

never
dissapointed
by
sierra

will
buy
again
next
year
o
knew
this
was
a
bit
old
when
i
bought
this
kind
of
a
shame
as
even
old
it
has
flashes
of
being
quite
good
very
drinkable
even
with
the
age
on
this
o
i
know
what
would
be
my
first
choice
on

day
definitely

crisp

dry
o
all
in
all
ill
start
by
saying
im
not
the
best
for
judging
these
styles
im
just
not
used
to
hunting
for
the
subtle
flavors
that
are
characteristic
of
this
type
of
style
i
love
bold
flavors
so
these
subtle
flavors
kid
of
throw
me
off
im
sure
according
to
stylistic
standard
this
is
a
great
pilsner
however
according
to
my
standards
im
not
really
impressed
if
you
like
lighter
beers
you
will
enjoy
this
you
can
pound
this
beer
i
bought
this
beer
on
sale
for
7
99
for
a
12
pack
this
is
my
last
beer
and
im
sad
to
see
it
go
first
off
because
it
was
such
a
bargain
and
second
of
all
because
its
just
a
nice
beer
to
drink
can
easily
put
back
a
6
pack
with
no
fatigue
overall
a
nice
summer
lager
overall
i
do
not
like
pilseners
however
i
really
enjoyed
this
o
the
perfect
thing
for
a
hot
summer
day
very
light
refreshing
and
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
perhaps
not
as
fresh
as
it
could
be
but
still
a
very
refreshing
flavoursome
pilsner
particularly
suited
to
summer
drinking
o
a
great
summer
beer
i
love
pilsners
and
this
was
definitely
a
winner
again
this
year
light
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
beer
is
as
drinkable
as
a
czech
pilsener
should
be
the
carbonation
is
a
little
fizzy
when
the
beer
is
held
in
the
mouth
but
does
not
take
away
from
the
flavors
notes
my
first
sn
beer
and
i
am
quite
surprised
at
how
modestly
hopped
this
beer
is
this
doesnt
fit
my
imagination
of
what
west
coast
beer
is
but
then
again
anchor
steam
surprised
me
too
i
guess
my
first
reaction
is
disappointment
expecting
more
with
bolder
hoppiness
however
i
next
am
in
awe
of
the
sheer
drinkability
and
balance
of
this
beer
not
as
bold
as
troegs
or
brooklyn
this
beer
is
utterly
and
seductively
sessionable
at
5
abv
this
is
a
beer
that
one
could
down
bottle
after
bottle
on
a
summer
day
and
all
through
the
evening
what
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
very
refreshing
my
favorite
summer
seasonal
lager
that
ive
had
more
flavorful
than
brooklyn
and
sam
adams
summer
beers
o
i
like
the
beer
and
think
it
has
refreshing
summer
beer
qualities
but
i
find
the
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
offset
those
thirst
quenching
properties
its
more
of
a
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
than
just
to
drink
by
the
pool
on
a
hot
summers
day
when
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
wonderful
golden
body
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
head
that
last
a
long
time
the
smell
is
crisp
and
grassy
the
taste
is
very
inviting
of
hops
and
some
citrus
some
malt
too
the
mouth
feel
is
great
easy
to
drink
and
crisp
with
a
little
after
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
o
not
overly
complex
but
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
pretty
standard
pilsner
just
another
light
summer
offering
clear
gold
with
one
finger
of
white
head
very
dense
tiny
bubble
lacing
head
recedes
to
a
ring
of
white
at
the
halfway
point
smell
is
grainy
grassy
and
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
taste
is
malty
with
a
quick
response
of
bitter
hops
a
bit
of
lemon
and
spice
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
good
with
plenty
of
carbonation
for
the
style
finish
is
medium
dry
with
a
lingering
bitterness
overall
a
nice
west
coast
take
on
a
classic
pilsener
very
drinkable
in
the
warmer
weather
good
job
sn
overall
a
very
solid
summer
lager
from
sierra
nevada
it
carries
some
of
the
trademark
sierra
nevada
aggressive
hopping
but
like
all
their
beer
it
works
its
never
overbearing
and
super
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
ooverall
this
is
very
good
beer
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
multiples
of
not
to
filling
very
smooth
sort
of
leaves
me
wanting
another
one
i
highly
recommend
this
over
any
commercial
lager
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
especially
to
introduce
someone
to
better
beer
with
extremely
refreshing
overall
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
not
too
strong
and
allows
for
the
flavors
to
reveal
themselves
i
enjoy
the
cleancrispness
which
would
make
it
a
good
summer
time
beer
poured
a
2
white

clear
pale
lemon
yellow
color
really
not
much
of
a
smell
at
all
at
first
and
as
it
warmed
all
i
got
was
grass
fairly
standard
bmc
taste
in
fact
i
dont
even
detect
any
of
those
common
attributes
of
spice
or
citrus
so
often
worked
into
summer
brews
this
really
is
just
typical
bmc
crisp
finish
but
not
a
standout
i
expected
more
from
sierra
nevada
o
i
come
from
the
camp
that
pilasters
are
the
best
summer
beers
sierra
nevadas
confirms
my
belief
overall
this
is
a
good
summer
lager
the
nose
could
be
a
more
complex
but
the
flavors
are
refreshing
and
well
balanced
i
opened
this
bottle
on
a
day
just
like
the
labeland
let
me
tell
you
it
dont
disappointwonderful
blondeorange
clear
pilsner
style
that
bubbles
a
frothy
lacey
headyou
can
already
smell
before
it
reaches
your
face
detected
a
floralmalty
odor
with
some
sweetness
and
spice
and
blended
together
perfectly
for
a
crisp
taste
that
didnt
leave
me
wanting
a
glass
of
water
afterwards
instead
another
not
to
tackle
my
thirst
but
for
the
pure
enjoyment
cant
wait
to
mow
the
grass
again
next
weekend
overall
this
is
the
first
lager
ive
ever
tried
from
sierra
nevada
but
its
not
really
thrilling
me
as
much
as
their
classic
ale
recipes
still
its
a
good
americanmade
czech
pilsener
style
and
would
take
this
any
day
over
any
generic
american
lager
macros
that
ive
seen
at
countless
parties
and
social
events
o
this
may
be
the
most
complex
czech
pilsener
ive
ever
had
overall
give
me
another
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
minimal
lacing
and
retention
the
nose
consists
of
lemon
peel
biscuit
hay
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
lemon
flavor
that
has
floral
hops
spices
and
sweetness
mixed
in
the
mouthfeel
is
fresh
crisp
and
smooth
and
overall
a
good
beer
from
sierra
nevada
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
drinking
beer
from
them
o
a
nice
beer
for
the
style
just
maybe
not
my
favorite
hopstyle
still
this
is
a
good
beer
to
pick
up
for
those
hot
summer
months
overall
a
pretty
decent
summer
lager
this
would
be
a
good
one
after
some
hardcore
outdoor
activities
great
mouthfeel
in
the
end
and
overall
this
is
one
fine
quencher
overall
an
easy
refreshing
summer
beer
nothing
above
and
beyond
here
but
definitely
a
beer
id
drink
time
and
time
again
this
is
what
an
american
macro
brew
should
taste
like
would
i
accept
one
if
offered
on
a
hot
summer
day
gladly
would
i
happily
pluck
one
out
of
a
cooler
otherwise
filled
with
buds
and
millers
and
coors
indeed
i
would
would
i
pay
a
premium
micro
brew
price
for
this
beer
again
no
i
would
not
frankly
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
in
the
summer
time
and
is
my
goto
summer
quencher
o
refreshing
good
for
a
summer
sipper
o
decent
beer
refreshing
crisp
overall
refreshing
for
a
summer
evening
but
not
all
that
tasty
leaves
me
wanting
more
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
malty
up
front
but
midtaste
the
flavor
of
the
herbal
hop
emerges
with
some
nice
gentle
grassy
and
tea
like
flavor
somewhat
floral
but
not
too
much
to
be
enjoyable
with
some
citrus
elements
the
taste
of
the
malt
is
gentle
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
mild
yeast
that
adds
some
character
to
the
brew
and
perhaps
a
tinge
of
mineral
the
overall
impression
i
get
from
this
is
it
is
a
great
beer
an
all
around
flavorful
and
quaffable
lager
which
is
saying
something
because
there
arent
enough
of
its
ilk
out
there
these
days
overall
the
sour
and
dryness
takes
away
from
the
refreshing
aspect
most
summer
ales
have
not
one
of
sierras
best
in
my
opinion
the
beer
is
pale
golden
and
crystal
clear
with
a
soapy
white
head
it
smells
of
lemony
grassy
hops
with
grains
and
salt
it
tastes
bitter
with
the
same
lemon
and
grassy
hops
a
smotth
pilsner
malt
flavor
washes
over
and
there
is
a
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
excellent
summer
beer
excellent
pilsner
all
around
o
nice
hot
weather
beer
refreshing
overall
a
very
nice
surprise
id
drink
more
of
this
summer
pilsner
really
enjoyed
the
little
explosions
of
flavors
im
an
ale
drinker
lagers
are
not
my
style
that
said
i
feel
compelled
to
sample
different
lagerpilsners
every
summer
summerfest
is
a
must
sample
for
me
as
sierra
nevada
is
my
favorite
brewery
the
beer
has
a
slightly
deeper
color
than
most
lagerspilsners
and
a
reasonable
amount
of
head
for
the
style
i
pick
up
grassy
like
aromas
and
hops
in
the
scent
its
a
smooth
beer
with
more
pilsner
characteristics
than
lager
its
very
smooth
and
very
little
aftertaste
again
its
not
my
style
but
one
of
the
better
products
in
its
class
overall
theyve
made
a
consistent
highly
drinkable
pils
for
the
right
time
of
year
sure
its
not
breaking
ground
but
what
it
does
it
does
well
excellent
summer
beer
but
certainly
not
the
best
summer
seasonal
or
even
sns
best
seasonal
take
it
for
what
it
is
simple
clean
refreshing
and
tasty
overall
a
tasty
seasonal
that
i
will
look
forward
too
next
year
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
czech
pilsners
to
date
for
pilsner
lovers
i
highly
recommend
this
one
a
good
light
summer
beer
a
decent
pilsner
but
you
can
definitely
get
some
more
flavorful
beers
for
the
price
good
for
what
its
going
for
though
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
didnt
stick
around
floral
hops
and
definite
note
of
honey
on
the
nose
not
fancy
artisanal
wildflower
honey
honey
from
the
plastic
bear
nice
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
that
i
associate
with
saaz
hops
clean
finish
and
nicely
carbonated
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wasnt
crazy
about
on
the
first
sip
but
as
it
warmed
a
bit
and
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
glass
i
liked
it
more
and
more
not
the
best
summer
seasonal
on
the
planet
but
especially
if
you
are
at
a
regular
supermarket
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
sierra
nevada
summerfest
lager
has
a
very
thick
egg
shellcolored
head
and
a
hazy
yellow
appearance
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
fine
particulate
matter
floating
about
the
aroma
is
faint
but
some
slight
breadiness
is
picked
up
taste
is
at
first
white
bread
but
hops
explode
in
the
mouth
at
the
mid
sip
its
hard
to
distinguish
the
various
hop
varieties
here
but
the
smooth
bitterness
is
delicious
mouthfeel
is
light
and
sierra
nevada
summerfest
lager
finishes
crisp
refreshing
and
semidry
i
really
liked
it
rjt
o
a
good
pilsner
overall
not
the
best
in
the
world
but
tasty
and
refreshing
nonetheless
clear
golden
yellow
with
only
a
ring
of
tiny
bubbles
around
the
edges
aroma
contains
lemon
and
grassy
hops
with
a
light
freshly
ground
grain
body
flavor
is
crisp
upfront
with
a
strong
carbonation
tingle
all
the
way
to
the
finish
hop
character
is
dominant
throughout
sweet
lemon
upfront
transitioning
to
grassy
and
finishing
very
dry
and
crisp
malts
are
balanced
and
provide
a
solid
sweetness
to
back
the
bold
hop
character
overall
a
solid
and
bigger
than
expected
malt
body
with
a
large
hop
character
for
a
lager
big
hop
flavor
for
a
crisp
beer
on
a
hot
day
this
summer
lager
pours
a
clear
golden
color
topped
by
a
thcik
brightwhite
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
both
hoppy
and
malty
spicy
and
citrusy
hops
with
some
cracker
like
malts
very
nice
the
flavor
is
much
the
nose
soft
bready
malt
balanced
by
moderate
hop
bitterness
and
moderate
spicy
hop
flavor
the
beer
finishes
nicely
balanced
and
just
dry
enough
to
make
you
want
more
immediately
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
body
medium
overall
a
very
well
crafted
one
of
the
best
summer
offerings
imo
o
tasty
and
east
drinking
cant
ask
for
much
more
especially
in
the
summer
on
a
hot
day
probably
wouldnt
stock
it
in
my
fridge
but
would
gladly
drink
again
an
allaround
delicious
beer
and
at
5
abv
one
that
you
wont
feel
guilty
drinking
from
noon
to
midnight
on
these
long
summer
days
its
nothing
fancy
but
it
really
hits
the
spot
its
a
good
summer
refresher
with
enough
flavor
to
satisfy
one
whos
looking
for
it
it
wont
blow
your
socks
off
but
it
does
its
job
well
it
would
pair
fantastically
with
a
back
porch
fish
fry
o
this
could
be
a
go
to
beer
during
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
beach
or
cookout
i
wouldnt
really
go
for
it
otherwise
pours
a
light
golden
color
nice
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nice
lacing
smell
is
underpowering
clean
grassy
some
hay
taste
is
clean
with
hops
floral
notes
a
little
pine
overall
a
nice
refreshing
beer
it
is
very
similar
to
their
pale
ale
only
lighter
and
not
as
intense
of
a
smell
or
taste
perfect
for
hot
weather
when
you
want
less
intensity
enjoyable
would
buy
again
i
love
sierra
nevada
beers
but
this
one
kind
of
disappoint
me
a
nice
crisp
clear
lager
nice
session
beer
barely
any
head
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
believe
this
beer
would
grow
on
me
but
i
remember
having
this
beer
last
year
and
loving
it
i
am
thinking
they
change
it
every
year
is
this
true
this
is
a
good
refreshing
summer
beer
it
isnt
super
hoppy
like
most
of
sns
beers
but
the
hops
are
certainly
there
if
you
need
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
your
cookout
its
had
to
go
wrong
with
this
selection
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
drinkable
lager
i
wish
sierra
nevada
made
this
beer
year
round
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
its
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
thus
far
at
right
at
5
alcohol
this
qualifies
as
a
great
summer
session
lager
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
perfect
for
the
summer
when
its
hot
outside
the
balanced
flavor
combined
with
the
crisp
finish
allow
this
beer
to
be
equally
refreshing
and
flavorful
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
light
and
crisp
in
the
summer
time
you
might
as
well
buy
any
american
adjunct
in
your
local
gas
station
theres
not
much
else
that
sets
this
apart
but
they
still
have
a
lot
of
other
great
beers
o
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
having
just
been
to
the
czech
beer
festival
in
berlin
i
would
argue
this
competes
with
the
originals
poured
a
bright
yet
cloudy
golden
little
head
smelled
of
hops
but
just
barely
perceptible
not
a
huge
scent
tasted
like
a
summer
czech
pils
should
dry
crisp
with
some
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
spot
on
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
quaff
after
a
hot
summer
day
nice
job
sn
overall
impression
with
sierra
nevada
being
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
knew
this
would
be
a
great
beer
from
the
start
clean
refreshing
and
could
enjoy
this
anytime
decent
drinkability
and
am
glad
i
picked
this
up
will
be
enjoying
again
when
available
overall
probably
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
that
i
have
had
to
date
it
reminded
me
of
a
slightly
toned
down
version
of
their
pale
ale
its
highly
drinkable
and
the
flavours
are
well
balanced
id
buy
it
again
thanks
for
the
bottle
swedes21
this
is
a
classic
summer
beer
not
too
challenging
and
highly
drinkable
im
never
necessarily
looking
forward
to
this
beer
but
i
end
up
picking
up
a
case
every
year
just
because
its
so
refreshing
taste
again
more
bread
taste
of
sour
doe
must
be
the
yeast
grassy
notes
again
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
reminiscent
of
the
grapefruit
flavor
hops
snb
is
famous
for
drinkable
refreshing
yes
out
of
this
world
brew
that
id
go
for
every
summer
not
so
much
m
not
overly
carbonated
and
it
isnt
a
palate
spoiler
would
be
nice
in
a
backyard
barbecue
the
summerfest
from
sierra
nevada
is
very
mild
and
drinkable
like
a
good
summer
ale
should
be
the
color
is
a
golden
straw
the
smell
is
slightly
citrus
and
mellow
i
really
like
how
mild
the
flavor
is
compaired
to
the
rest
of
sierra
nevadas
beers
summerfest
is
very
smooth
i
like
the
mild
alternative
for
a
summer
ale
their
ipas
are
nice
but
i
like
those
more
in
the
cooler
months
i
really
like
this
beer
the
body
was
a
bit
fuller
than
typical
for
the
style
drinkability
was
pretty
good
the
beer
went
down
smooth
and
easy
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
although
i
would
tend
to
grab
a
local
version
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
this
style
a
decent
brew
thats
worth
grabbing
a
sixer
when
youre
in
the
mood
overall
while
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
here
i
do
think
the
summerfest
is
essentially
what
it
should
be
a
light
crisp
refreshing
and
relatively
tasty
summery
beer
notes
what
a
solid
czech
pilsner
crisp
well
made
and
the
dry
finish
is
great
cheers
hohum
at
least
its
better
than
a
macro
lager
nothing
offensive
well
balanced
but
for
a
craft
lager
is
very
raw
and
you
can
taste
the
adjunct
grain
in
places
hop
character
and
feel
are
redeeming
qualities
o
crisp
clean
lager
that
would
probably
impress
your
macrodrinking
friends
that
being
said
slightly
too
much
residual
sweetness
for
me
but
if
you
bought
me
one
i
wouldnt
say
no
appearance
is
a
clear
golden
straw
with
a
billowy
pale
white
head
atop
scents
of
fresh
cut
hay
and
some
citrus
make
for
an
enjoyable
smell
the
taste
is
quite
enjoyable
as
well
some
lemonlime
flavors
are
noticeable
with
a
slight
piney
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
very
crisp
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
the
perfect
beer
for
a
cook
out
on
a
hot
summer
day
im
generally
not
a
big
fan
of
pilseners
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
wouldnt
be
one
of
my
first
summer
beer
choices
and
not
on
the
top
of
my
favorites
from
sierra
but
still
a
decent
beer
enjoyable
enough
to
crack
open
a
second
i
havent
drank
too
many
czech
pilsners
but
it
seems
to
be
a
good
example
i
couldnt
help
but
think
this
was
an
interpretation
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
then
again
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilseners
and
dont
have
much
experience
with
the
czech
style
overall
not
a
great
summer
but
okay
overall
a
nice
summer
beer
definitely
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
while
doing
yard
work
a
good
crisp
clean
lager
for
hot
summer
days
a
nice
spicy
hoppiness
is
complimented
well
by
a
maltiness
that
is
not
over
powering
a
good
clean
brew
this
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
color
crested
with
a
tiny
head
the
aroma
is
nice
zesty
hops
and
bready
malts
the
taste
here
is
quite
simply
that
of
a
solid
czech
pilsner
substantial
noble
hops
and
some
slightly
breadier
malts
than
is
typical
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
and
with
a
decent
amount
of
thickness
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
inexpensive
czech
pilsner
nothing
remarkable
but
it
wont
let
you
down
overall
pretty
good
ale
but
again
i
would
suggest
just
getting
their
pale
ale
if
you
are
new
to
the
fold
however
if
you
have
some
experience
with
this
brewer
then
by
all
means
shake
things
up
it
surely
made
my
thursday
watching
nba
finals
quite
exciting
overall
an
average
offering
from
sn
o
i
picked
this
up
as
a
requiem
after
another
100
degree
day
and
ya
know
what
it
works
pretty
well
clean
crisp
and
very
tasty
ogood
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
just
nothing
to
thrilling
would
drink
it
again
for
a
barbecue
or
something
like
that
but
something
i
will
be
excited
to
drink
again
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
golden
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
only
slightly
as
you
finish
the
smell
is
very
impressive
hoppy
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
fruit
the
taste
is
crisp
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
very
easy
to
drink
pick
this
up
if
youre
looking
for
something
refreshing
onot
a
bad
beer
there
are
no
negative
qualities
but
it
isnt
too
memorable
its
a
fairly
boring
beer
this
would
probably
be
best
served
along
with
a
meal
or
something
but
if
youre
going
to
just
be
drinking
a
beer
than
this
probably
wont
satisfy
you
but
as
long
as
you
do
have
something
else
to
go
along
with
this
beer
than
id
say
you
could
probably
drink
a
lot
of
them
with
out
getting
tired
of
it
compared
to
other
pilsners
its
just
average
12
oz
into
a
snifter
heck
of
a
clean
pour
golden
and
with
a
big
billowy
head
that
retains
well
looks
like
many
classics
of
the
style
smell
is
well
balanced
in
favor
of
the
malt
quite
clean
wish
it
had
a
little
more
yeast
character
but
otherwise
its
quite
solid
taste
is
quite
clean
and
sweet
but
wellbalanced
definitely
a
good
one
here
mouthfeel
is
as
advertised
crisp
clean
refreshing
sierra
nevada
almost
never
disappoints
and
this
is
a
highly
recommended
pilsener
good
for
them
i
know
that
lagering
is
not
one
of
their
specialties
so
this
is
even
more
impressive
for
that
reason
overallvery
refreshing
awesome
summer
beer
extremely
soothing
after
a
long
day
of
work
overall
a
damn
fine
summer
beer
and
it
wont
be
my
last
time
drinking
it
this
summer
taste
is
crips
and
smooth
citrussy
has
that
element
of
pilsner
a
little
carbonation
but
the
added
hops
make
it
a
more
complex
lager
nice
moderate
carbonation
perhaps
could
be
a
bit
higher
d
im
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
but
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
light
crisp
refreshing
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
taking
a
break
after
mowing
the
lawn
a
passable
afternoon
session
beer
not
too
bad
but
not
too
gravitated
towards
it
much
either
it
would
do
in
a
pinch
on
a
hot
day
for
sure
crisp
and
clean
carbonation
and
a
light
body
makes
this
beer
ideal
for
summer
even
if
it
lacks
complexity
or
character
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
lively
carbonation
a
slightly
drying
finish
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
beer
ideal
for
a
hot
summers
day
but
nothing
really
mind
blowing
about
it
either
a
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
pilsner
for
the
summertime
im
always
happy
to
pick
these
up
for
summer
barbeques
and
its
a
very
easy
beer
to
introduce
to
noncraft
drinkers
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
the
taste
would
have
been
more
interesting
if
it
wasnt
dominated
by
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
and
there
were
some
more
malty
flavors
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
pillowy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
smells
of
mild
spice
and
grass
taste
has
a
little
spice
up
front
with
maybe
a
little
lemon
in
there
cant
really
tell
good
carbonation
and
very
smooth
very
enjoyable
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
finally
buy
a
case
of
this
o
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
and
is
perfect
for
the
season
if
you
dont
like
most
brewerys
summer
seasonals
that
to
be
perfectly
honest
seem
to
be
geared
towards
females
give
this
one
a
shot
oa
good
offering
from
sn
just
not
all
that
memorable
md
extremely
drinkable
light
bodied
pilsner
with
some
style
well
carbonated
with
a
clean
finish
for
sure
an
allday
drinker
for
the
warm
summer
months
the
taste
is
very
light
and
crisp
i
get
a
very
noticable
spice
taste
on
the
tounge
the
hop
flavor
is
present
but
not
overpowering
this
beer
has
a
bite
to
it
that
leaves
as
fast
as
it
comes
on
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
i
could
drink
this
all
day
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
but
pretty
smooth
drinking
high
carbonation
but
not
too
high
overall
a
drinkable
nonoffensive
pilsner
but
nothing
outstanding
enjoyable
pilsner
that
i
would
buy
again
next
summer
2011
summerfest
pours
golden
color
with
medium
head
smells
of
pines
and
tastes
some
hops
very
refreshing
and
seems
like
a
typical
sierra
nevada
beer
very
simple
yet
refreshing
summerfest
is
especially
suited
for
the
season
it
is
named
after
unfortunately
i
dont
get
any
other
aromas
than
pine
and
hops
i
would
love
to
have
a
lager
go
to
but
all
lagers
taste
the
same
to
me
pours
out
a
straw
yellow
color
it
has
a
definite
grain
smell
to
it
as
well
as
a
definite
note
of
the
hops
has
the
familiar
pilsner
sting
to
the
taste
and
this
does
stay
with
you
like
it
does
most
pilsners
for
a
cross
between
a
pilsner
and
a
lager
it
isnt
bad
though
i
think
i
would
go
with
one
or
the
other
still
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
and
something
i
would
drink
again
overall
a
good

pours
a
clear
bright
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
goes
down
quite
quickly
scent
is
grainy
with
some
hints
of
lemon
grass
and
hops
a
very
subtle
and
inviting
lager
taste
is
initially
a
bit
on
the
floral
side
with
some
nice
hints
of
grain
and
lemon
then
i
get
some
hop
flavors
and
nice
grassy
notes
this
beer
is
very
wellbalanced
with
its
flavors
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
very
crisp
finish
extremely
refreshing
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
for
summer
heat
and
just
a
great
representation
of
the
style
o
a
very
drinkable
summer
lager
this
one
tops
sam
adams
noble
pils
in
my
book
a
great
clean
pilsner
with
an
impressive
amount
of
flavor
tasty
overall
not
the
best
beer
on
earth
but
a
truly
remarkable
example
of
a
czech
pils
sierra
nevada
continues
their
tradition
of
tasty
brews
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
with
some
good
good
light
malts
its
super
drinkable
and
tasty
very
solid
summer
beer
a
good
lager
i
would
purchase
this
one
again
o
i
cant
really
knock
this
brew
for
any
specific
element
because
it
is
pretty
good
that
said
i
am
not
crazy
about
it
medium
body
higher
carbonation
easy
on
the
tongue
drinks
okay
but
pretty
boring
flavor
and
forgettable
overall
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
quite
good
nothing
over
the
top
or
fantastic
but
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
summerlike
day
o
ive
been
drinking
too
many
ipas
dipas
and
barley
wines
so
it
took
this
review
to
remind
me
that
i
do
actually
enjoy
lagers
sierra
nevada
always
seems
a
little
hoppier
than
most
in
all
their
offerings
its
what
i
love
about
them
this
lager
is
very
refreshing
and
has
a
nice
well
balanced
taste
a
great
choice
after
mowing
my
yard
overall
this
beer
is
nice
and
refreshing
however
i
personally
enjoy
a
little
bit
more
bitter
hop
characteristic
in
a
pilsner
than
this
has
to
offer
but
i
after
buying
a
sixpack
i
wont
be
disappointed
to
have
this
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
great
summer
beer
by
definition
i
think
summer
beers
should
be
on
the
lighter
side
in
terms
of
flavor
body
and
abv
nobody
wants
drinking
beers
to
become
a
chore
in
the
heat
if
you
like
their
pale
ale
you
will
love
this
seasonal
couldwill
definitely
session
these
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
literally
everyone
i
know
loves
it
cant
go
wrong
keeping
these
in
the
fridge
or
bringing
them
to
a
bbqparty
newbies
girls
the
seasoned
beer
drinker
and
everyone
in
between
has
given
this
the
best
acclaim
anyone
can
give
a
beer
they
always
ask
for
another
o
d
this
could
be
a
goto
summer
beer
tasty
interesting
hoppy
not
too
expensive
good
beer
o
sierra
nevada
creates
another
well
rounded
brew
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
good
session
brew
and
despite
its
name
one
for
year
round
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
bright
yellow
appearance
with
a
subtle
head
that
fades
quickly
slight
hint
of
hops
in
the
scent
along
with
a
barely
noticeable
spiciness
tasted
like
a
weak
czech
pilsener
didnt
have
the
hop
profile
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
style
had
a
very
light
mouthfeel
and
was
an
easy
drinker
i
felt
like
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
and
not
get
filled
up
pours
a
macrolagerlike
yellowgreen
straw
color
with
a
thin
sudsy
head
nose
of
straw
and
light
citrus
hops
richer
flavor
than
the
color
would
suggest
nicely
malty
medium
bodied
lager
front
porch
beer
refreshing
with
good
flavor
nothing
earthshattering
here
but
a
perfectly
good
summer
session
beer
o
its
good
a
real
palate
cleanser
got
better
as
it
warmed
nice
for
a
warm
evening
like
tonight
o
all
the
flavors
are
right
but
the
volume
is
down
too
low
underwhelming
but
still
decent
would
probably
go
best
on
a
day
when
its
hot
and
you
need
something
cold
this
would
fill
the
bill
goes
down
smoothly
and
easily
overall
a
very
good
pilsner
though
i
have
certainly
have
better
a
little
too
malty
vs
hoppy
would
recommend
to
a
friend
a
crisp
and
refreshing
lager
if
not
a
bit
mundane
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
a
touch
sweet
taste
is
crisp
very
refreshing
a
bit
of
sweetness
with
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
sns
summer
offerings
best
quality
is
that
it
doesnt
try
to
be
too
complex
but
at
the
same
time
its
a
lager
that
even
a
beer
geek
will
find
himself
never
getting
bored
with
its
drinkability
is
exceptional
and
it
therefore
always
has
a
place
in
my
fridge
during
the
warm
months
of
the
year
only
problem
is
i
wish
this
was
a
yearround
offering
overall
i
was
surprised
how
low
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
were
but
how
they
stuck
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
for
a
minute
after
sipping
certainly
one
of
the
better
tasting
pilsners
i
have
had
this
is
very
crisp
and
smooth
upfront
giving
way
to
a
bitter
finish
in
the
back
whole
grain
buttery
bread
up
front
followed
by
bitter
greens
a
delightful
brew
it
honestly
reminds
me
too
much
of
a
bmc
just
a
few
notches
above
in
the
hop
profile
im
conflicted
its
a
solid
beer
but
its
got
lawnmower
overtones
and
for
the
price
id
rather
just
have
a
bmc
i
cant
believe
i
just
wrote
that
the
aftertaste
is
satisfyingly
bitter
with
an
oily
hoppiness
that
lasts
for
a
good
while
on
tap
pours
a
translucent
staw
color
with
an
inch
of
head
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
lemon
earthy
and
grains
tastes
like
a
pilsener
but
with
a
bit
more
hops
and
some
lemon
nice
bitter
finish
earthy
flavor
as
well
as
some
cut
grass
smooth
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
pilsener
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
perfect
for
summer
obviously
overall
i
dig
it
and
look
forward
to
having
some
more
taste
is
more
complex
than
your
normal
pilsener
or
lager
with
a
small
hoppy
bitterness
that
balances
out
a
fun
little
maltiness
both
flavors
are
pretty
subtle
but
create
a
really
solid
and
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
a
perfect
crisp
and
totatlly
refreshing
mouthfeel
this
beer
becomes
one
of
my
favorites
to
simply
enjoy
when
im
relaxing
in
the
summer
its
fairly
simple
and
concise
leaving
me
to
enjoy
a
decent
beer
thats
also
refreshing
overall
i
cant
say
im
that
impressed
ive
had
other
5
abv
pilseners
that
blow
this
one
out
of
the
water
might
even
be

a
very
nice
and
delicate
spicy
nose
with
hints
of
grassy
and
floral
hops
i
also
get
that
european
pilsner
grainy
smell
taste
is
so
refreshing
with
that
spicy
hop
in
the
beginning
and
a
nice
tangy
bitterness
to
go
along
with
that
bready
almost
wheat
like
pilsner
malt
the
best
thing
about
this
is
the
mouthfeel
in
my
opinion
its
been
lagered
for
a
while
and
you
can
tell
it
almost
gives
off
that
creamy
samuel
adams
boston
lager
type
body
which
i
think
a
lot
of
pilsners
are
missing
this
long
lagering
period
that
they
speak
of
is
really
the
highlight
of
this
beer
when
compared
to
the
other
amazing
pilsners
like
noble
pils
and
prima
pils
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
of
all
time
so
crisp
refreshing
and
such
a
nice
herbal
bitterness
for
a
low
ibu
top
notch
beer
from
sierra
nevada
do
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
quaffable
to
boot
i
am
normally
not
a
huge
lager
fan
but
i
can
make
an
exception
for
this
moreys
bottom
line
i
would
definitely
consider
picking
up
a
sixer
of
this
if
i
was
having
a
bbq
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
disapeared
smell
was
buscuit
malt
with
a
hint
of
herbal
and
grassy
hops
taste
was
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
nothing
over
the
top
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
crisp
dry
yet
very
refreshing
very
light
body
and
good
level
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
go
to
lager
could
perhaps
be
a
bit
bolder
but
is
a
great
summer
refreshing
beer
complimented
my
waffle
fries
and
brats
nicely
nice
light
summer
time
beer
nothing
over
the
top
nicely
balanced
a
clear
pale
colored
beer
with
a
nice
creamy
head
and
nice
retention
and
lacing
faint
smell
be
careful
not
to
snort
it
up
your
nose
trying
to
smell
biscuits
and
earthy
grassy
notes
some
floral
notes
the
taste
is
pretty
average
pale
ale
with
a
bit
more
citrus
notes
than
most
faintly
bitter
biscuity
and
grassy
with
some
earthy
notes
pretty
average
but
refreshing
light
and
easy
to
drink
as
i
said
straightforward
sn
should
do
some
more
bottled
lagers
nicely
done
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
i
could
easily
see
myself
downing
a
6
pack
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
i
definitely
will
buy
more
of
this
if
i
can
find
it
overall
a
nice
summer
session
beer
perfect
for
putting
away
several
or
just
taking
a
break
from
the
heavier
offerings
out
there
overall
a
nice
refreshing
lager
excellent
beer
after
a
hard
days
work
in
the
summer
heat
would
recommend
and
and
purchase
this
beer
time
and
again
d
its
a
good
drinkable
pilsner
these
are
great
refreshing
beers
and
sierra
nevada
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
park
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
pretty
good
its
a
pretty
standard
pilsner
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
think
they
would
be
great
on
a
hot
sunny
day
not
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
but
id
try
it
again
what
a
bummer
i
was
so
pumped
to
try
this
beer
when
i
show
it
on
the
shelves
at
my
local
shop
got
it
home
and
gave
it
go
after
it
was
chilled
i
found
myself
asking
if
this
was
really
a
sierra
nevada
product
i
understand
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
light
and
refreshing
for
the
time
of
year
but
this
was
really
light
and
along
the
weak
side
for
me
there
really
wasnt
a
whole
lot
of
hops
in
this
from
what
i
could
get
from
it
the
color
was
a
light
yellow
and
very
clean
looking
thin
head
i
know
the
style
of
beer
is
supposed
to
be
like
this
but
i
thought
sn
would
have
amped
something
up
just
a
little
to
give
it
a
bit
more
of
a
punch
overall
summerfest
is
an
average
but
not
exceptional
pilsener
it
goes
down
easily
with
a
dry
crisp
finish
as
the
name
suggests
this
is
a
good
choice
for
the
summer
but
there
are
better
alternatives
out
there
as
this
is
slightly
better
than
average
poured
a
clear
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
dissapated
slowly
the
aroma
was
that
of
grass
and
citrus
the
flavor
was
mildly
bitter
with
a
nice
hoppy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
refreshing
overall
a
nice
summer
brew
but
nothing
special
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
highly
drinkable
has
a
different
taste
then
most
pilsners
styles
out
there
this
is
something
i
would
love
to
drink
at
a
party
or
anywhere
for
that
matter
i
like
it
d
i
didnt
think
this
was
all
that
amazing
great
for
the
summer
time
and
one
could
definitely
drink
a
lot
of
these
however
it
just
seems
like
an
amp
up
version
of
a
bmc
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
nice
crisp
hop
bite
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
over
the
sweet
malt
body
into
a
slightly
dry
refreshing
finish
dry
bitter
hops
up
front
countered
by
sweet
pale
malts
and
crisp
light
fruit
notes
especially
apple
and
pear
slight
bready
yeast
with
faint
grassy
straw
notes
very
quaffable
especially
in
hot
summer
weather
drinkability
without
a
doubt
very
drinkable
just
near
the
end
the
hops
seem
to
go
a
bit
piney
its
very
interesting
the
range
of
flavors
that
are
present
in
the
beer
from
only
two
hop
varietals
theyre
bold
but
not
overpowering
striking
an
excellent
balance
the
finish
is
clean
and
very
refreshing
this
is
an
excellent
summer

is
a
great
brewery

here

i
could
definitely
drink
a

of

have
a

more
of
these

pretty
tasty

wrong
with
this
brew
they
definately
have
better
beers
and
if
this
was
abit
cheaper
i
could
see
this
as
a
nice
session
beer
especially
for
the
summer
this
is
a
very
good
summer
refresher
flavorful
crisp
and
delicious
definitely
great
when
ice
cold
d
very
easy
easy
easy
note
from
some
other
reviews
i
see
this
previously
was
labeled
a
pale
lager
not
a
czech
pilsener
id
give
it
half
a
point
in
taste
if
its
measured
against
that
style
dpretty
easy
to
drink
could
have
a
couple
no
but
its
more
of
a
style
prejudice
md
mouthfeel
is
good
and
thick
but
is
easily
swallowed
making
this
a
great
lawnmower
beer
and
very
drinkable
however
unless
youre
trying
to
make
a
statement
unless
a
far
less
expensive
macro
i
would
just
purchase
those
instead
of
this
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
high
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
it
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
flavors
working
in
its
favor
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
and
a
easy
drinking
beer
overall
a
decent
quaff
but
kind
of
heavy
and
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
one
would
expect
from
a
czech
pilsener
the
bottle
claims
that
this
lager
is
crisp
and
refreshing
it
is
nice
job
sn
served
in
a
pint
glass
i
like
a
good
pilsner
and
this
one
is
hops
are
balanced
well
against
a
malty
dry
taste
the
color
is
slightly
deeper
yellow
other
pilsners
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
though
i
have
a
difficult
time
justifying
paying
mircobrew
prices
for
a
pilsner
nevertheless
this
one
is
just
as
good
as
any
of
the
quality
german
imports
such
as
spaten
ah
the
whole
foods
bargain
area
delightful
this
guy
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
flowers
corn
grass
and
a
touch
of
sugar
the
taste
is
similar
with
the
floral
hops
really
coming
through
nicely
along
with
a
hint
of
oatmeal
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
very
light
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
solid
pils
but
missing
a
small
something
in
the
taste
department
to
really
kick
it
up
a
peg
d
good
beer
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
not
with
better
cheaper
pilsners
out
there
sam
adams
noble
pils
im
looking
at
you
in
fact
i
didnt
buy
it
the
first
time
i
swapped
one
bottle
of
my
sierra
nevada
kellerweis
hefeweizen
at
a
party
with
a
guy
who
brought
summerfest
alright
pilsner
but
buy
on
sale
if
you
can
quite
a
refreshing
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
colored
with
an
active
pocketfilled
head
smells
florally
fragrant
and
lightly
hoppy
when
cold
and
then
a
sweet
grainy
aroma
comes
through
once
it
picks
up
in
temperature
its
got
a
nice
sweetness
with
just
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
very
active
carbonation
to
this
lightbodied
beer
and
its
quite
gassy
so
i
pace
myself
with
these
very
enjoyable
d
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
id
like
to
see
a
bit
of
a
thicker
and
longerlasting
head
but
otherwise
its
quite
spoton
clear
golden
yellow
fluffy
white
head
some
retention
lace
acidic
soapyfloral
hops
slightly
sweet
slight
soapyfloral
hop
flavour
needs
some
more
bready
maltyness
and
bitterness
its
just
too
light
for
a
pils
light
to
moderate
body
moderate
carbonation
approachable
quite
quaffable
but
it
doesnt
bring
me
back
for
more
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
and
a
half
of
white
head
the
beer
is
a
nice
golden
color
the
smell
has
that
european
pilsner
smell
to
it
it
is
grassy
and
grainy
the
taste
definately
reminds
me
of
bavarian
beer
it
is
crisp
and
clean
with
some
grassy
flavor
it
is
an
ok
beer
its
just
not
a
style
that
i
seek
or
crave
i
think
this
one
earned
its
pretty
high
marks
from
me
i
bought
this
as
an
experimental
sixer
from
hyvee
and
i
wish
i
had
read
the
label
first
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilsners
to
begin
with
and
this
is
an
explosion
of
the
classic
pilsner
taste
theres
some
hops
and
grain
and
thats
about
it
it
actually
seemed
a
bit
sour
call
me
a
hater
if
you
want
but
this
is
not
going
to
be
in
my
fridge
ever
again
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
my
sam
adams
glass
thanks
guys
pale

with
minor

and
a
touch
of
crisp

in
the

a
bit
more
bready
than
expected
along
with
subdued
hops
yields
hohum
flavor
crisp
and
quenching
but
nothing
special
drinkable
sure
but
after
one
theres
little
to
bring
me
back
for
more
discovering
that
this
is
a
czech
pilsner
is
even
more
offputting
its
a
rather
weak
interpretation
of
the
style
billowing
white
rocky

pretty
quick
dissipation
with
minimal
lacing
clear

streams
of
rising

is
fairly
sweet
balanced
by
floral

taste
mirrors
nose
a
slight
bit
of
bitterness
but
certainly
on
the
sweet
side
light
mouthfeel
with
not
a
lot
of
effervescence
certainly
drinkable
but
there
are
a
lot
of
better
pilseners
to
be
had
d
really
good
one
of
the
better
summer
labeled
beers
out
there
definitely
worth
a
shot
i
enjoyed
a
sixteen
ounce
glass
of
this
beer
at
the
amsterdam
ale
house
on
manhattans
upper
west
side
i
am
surprised
to
learn
that
this
is
a
czech
style
pilsner
and
am
weary
of
anyone
outside
of
pilsen
attempting
this
style
in
general
i
liked
it
a
lot
very
light
and
refreshing
a
little
cloudy
in
color
with
a
great
smell
very
good
summer
beer
but
not
my
favorite
i
generally
like
german
pilsners
better
overall
this
is
not
sns
best
beer
but
as
always
they
do
a
good
job
with
it
d
a
nice
crisp
lager
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
beer
has
no
redeeming
qualities
and
is
sierra
nevadas
worst
effort
ive
seen
so
far
dvery
drinkable
i
had
bought
this
in
the
past
and
wasnt
too
impressed
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
chance
in
2010
hoppy
zestful
refreshing
quaffable
pilsners
like
this
seem
to
me
as
essential
to
hot
summer
days
as
sun
screen
sandals
and
a
pool
or
lake
ignore
food
pairings
although
just
about
anything
done
on
a
bbq
seems
a
safe
bet
and
just
pair
this
with
friends
and
a
beach
this
beer
is
as
agreeable
as
the
summer
season
itself
and
like
it
i
find
myself
sorrowfully
missing
it
the
other
months
of
the
year
the
taste
instantly
reminds
me
of
fresh
biscuits
slightly
sweet
but
mostly
tasting
of
cereal
grains
the
bitterness
is
subtle
with
just
the
hint
of
spicy
noble
hops
very
wellbalanced
and
palatable
the
body
is
medium
with
a
grainy
mouthfeel
prickly
carbonation
and
an
overall
dry
texture
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
and
would
be
a
very
good
session
beer
at
5
abv
its
not
overwhelming
and
i
could
recommend
it
to
anyone
even
those
that
cant
seem
to
crack
away
from
the
largescale
brewers
its
got
a
nice
hay
color
maybe
a
little
more
golden
and
had
a
pretty
good
head
poured
from
the
12
oz
bottle
around
4045
degrees
to
me
it
had
a
citrus
aroma
more
like
a
red
grapefruit
first
drink
was
slightly
bitter
but
overall
very
smooth
as
i
stated
in
the
beginning
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
exceptional
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
wanting
a
good
session
brew
i
love
this
beer
and
often
drink
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
i
know
its
a
sin
its
a
great
summer
beer
with
its
delicious
crisp
pilsner
taste
immensely
quaffable
this
is
my
go
to
summer
seasonal
i
love
sn
and
this
one
is
def
not
an
exception
always
dreamed
of
the
day
i
would
taste
a
sierra
nevada
selection
that
didnt
seems
overpowered
or
based
on
a
palate
of
their
signature
cascade
hops
well
i
finally
got
it
and
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
i
beautiful
appearance
and
crisp
clean
smell
waters
the
mouth
but
only
for
slight
disappointment
dont
get
it
twisted
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
loses
for
me
on
the
terms
of
being
a
summer
selection
few
breweries
master
the
summer
seasonal
as
it
seems
that
most
just
offer
a
watered
down
selection
of
their
flagship
brew
and
sierra
nevada
nearly
falls
into
that
category
it
falls
short
in
taste
while
simultaneously
lacking
in
the
refreshment
category
and
that
for
me
is
a
big
nono
if
you
sacrifice
one
you
better
compensate
in
the
other
good
beer
descent
summer
seasonal
picked
up
a
12
pack
of
this
for
11
99
a
great
deal
decent
head
retention
and
carbonation
true
to
the
lager
style
but
not
watery
or
transparent
like
some
it
is
light
and
refreshing
and
reminds
me
of
a
euro
lager
but
a
better
aftertaste
than
most
of
them
there
is
enough
hop
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
but
it
is
not
too
much
hop
this
is
great
for
a
pint
or
a
long
session
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
beer
poured
super
clear
golden
yellow
the
smell
is
of
grain
maybe
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
bit
of
lemon
as
i
warms
up
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbed
which
is
expected
of
the
style
all
and
all
a
good
solid
beer
i
could
enjoy
on
a
day
which
is
what
sn
was
going
for
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
is
fairly
bland
compared
to
real
czech
pilsners
i
would
be
willing
to
have
this
again
though
not
if
say
pilsner
urquell
were
another
option
good
summer
refresher
though
dnot
a
big
pilsner
fan
in
general
this
one
is
pretty
good
wouldnt
probably
buy
it
again
mostly
since
i
dont
typically
choose
pilsners
sn
does
good
work
none
the
less
d
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
but
not
entirely
memorable
effort
from
sn
this
is
a
great
food
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
if
i
were
just
drinking
mfd
very
thin
carbonation
may
be
one
of
the
only
noticable
traits
of
this
beer
d
perfect
for
porch
stoopsitting
in
baltimore
sitting
in
the
summer
on
relaxing
moderate
afternoons
and
evenings
first
experience
was
a
on
a
roof
deck
with
a
friend
and
we
both
enjoyed
it
but
not
overly
and
eventually
returned
to
the
store
for
a
second
six
pack
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
however
would
try
somthing
new
instead
givin
the
opertunity
a
lovely
brew
indeed
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
shortlived
white
head
has
aromas
predominately
of
grains
with
notes
similar
to
pinot
grigio
dancing
in
the
distance
grains
and
grass
feature
loudly
on
the
front
palate
with
a
freshly
cut
grasslike
bitterness
that
grows
in
intensity
on
the
finish
hint
of
lemon
zest
is
in
there
as
well
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
a
decent
summer
pilsener
i
really
enjoyed
the
spicy
hop
character
but
the
bittering
was
a
little
too
tannic
for
me
easy
drinking
to
be
sure
and
it
sure
looked
like
simmer
in
a
glass
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
nice
summer
seasonal
drinkability
sierra
nevalda
makes
some
fine
flavorful
beers
this
one
is
no
exception
nice
beer
for
a
summer
day
without
being
insipid
overall
just
a
good
thirstquenching
and
drinkable
beer
excellent
on
a
summer
night
overall
great
summer
beer
decent
for
the
style
very
drinkable
but
nothing
earthshattering
a
good
standard
pils
im
not
usually
a
huge
advocate
of
light
summer
beers
but
for
a
lager
i
found
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
more
depth
than
most
lagers
ive
drank
and
surprisingly
sweet
for
a
sierra
nevada
my
customers
find
it
equally
delightful
i
formidable
lager
d
drinkable
though
not
a
lot
on
a
hot
summer
day
just
a
little
bit
too
heavy
for
a
casual
beer
but
well
balanced
and
flavorful
this
is
a
clean
and
refreshing
beergreat
for
summer
solid
summer
session
beer
a
little
lacking
in
complexity
but
it
is
refreshing
solid
tasting
beer
i
need
to
try
more
pilsners
but
this
and
sam
adams
noble
are
very
similar
probably
give
the
edge
to
sn
just
seemed
to
have
more
substance
but
both
are
solid
summer
drinkers
pretty
drinkable
and
pretty
nice
for
the
style
so
i
started
writing
a
pretty
standard
issue
astmd
review
but
realized
this
beer
would
be
illsuited
for
such
a
review
for
me
this
is
a
quintessential
american
summer
brew
light
crisp
and
refreshing
while
highly
drinkable
for
any
grilling
session
this
lager
holds
enough
malt
backbone
hop
bite
and
yeast
spice
to
satisfy
every
bas
discerning
tastes
pretty
herbaceous
lager
here
that
strikes
a
perfect
balance
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
very
nice
for
a
hot
day
after
the
pour
this
beer
is
a
transparent
golden
color
with
about
a
one
inch
head
that
quickly
subsided
smells
refreshing
with
a
little
bit
of
grain
i
dont
have
a
great
nose
tastes
bitter
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
but
not
in
the
after
taste
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
for
a
hot
day
but
not
spectacular
i
doubt
that
i
will
buy
it
again
after
i
finish
this
6
pack

please
pours

great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
sweet
malt
hops
hint
of

and
a
hint
of
wheat
fits
the
style
of
a
czech
pilsner
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
pale
malt
slight
citrus
hint
of
hops
slight
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
wheat
overall
decent
aroma
good
blend
and
good
body
without
going
into
the
normal
details
this
is
absolutely
handsdown
the
most
refreshing
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
so
hot
where
i
am
and
this
cools
me
right
down
its
too
bad
this
isnt
out
all
year
long
drinkability
is
very
high
and
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
d
the
fact
that
i
have
gotten
multiple
sixers
is
proof
this
is
not
only
good
but
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
ok
though
lacking
in
flavor
for
the
most
part
it
tastes
fresh
at
least
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
would
give
to
somebody
who
doesnt
normally
drink
craft
while
i
sip
a
torpedo
perhaps
it
was
just
where
i
had
this
beer
but
it
was
disgusting
it
tasted
lile
bud
light
with
lemon
this
was
straight
up
awful
and
makes
me
want
to
hurl
there
was
little
to
no
flavor
and
i
saw
almost
now
carbonation
the
after
taste
was
like
urine
and
cake
i
cannot
exactly
figure
out
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
but
i
am
thouroiughly
disappointed
the
absence
of
flavor
saddened
me
because
of
sns
standard
of
quality
but
two
of
us
ordered
pints
and
were
subject
to
this
i
was
told
it
is
supposed
to
be
better
but
i
am
not
convinced
this
is
basically
a
sn
pale
ale
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
less
hops
a
beer
which
a
nonhop
head
could
enjoy
light
and
drinkable
nothing
that
will
blow
your
socks
off
i
doubt
its
different
than
2009s
but
im
much
more
impressed
this
time
it
really
does
have
a
substantial
amount
of
bitterness
for
a
pils
light
and
clean
make
this
a
great
summer
beer
ill
definitely
buy
more
though
i
still
wish
it
were
a
bit
cheaper
ive
adjusted
the
scores
from
my
previous
review
this
is
your
typical
true
pilsner
served
in
a
frosty
mug
this
beer
tasted
of
noble
hops
and
2
row
barley
which
gives
it
a
pretty
good
bitterness
compared
to
other
pilsners
there
was
some
floral
esters
and
lemon
there
too
i
would
say
it
is
along
the
same
lines
as
the
sam
adams
noble
pils
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
d
nice
and
crisp
fairly
light
body
goes
down
real
easy
a
nice
drinker
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
very
drinkable
a
great
beer
to
have
when
sitting
out
by
the
pool
or
doing
some
outdoor
activities
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
thought
it
just
lacked
any
excitement
or
any
remembering
qualities
is
it
drinkable
sure
but
it
cant
hold
a
candle
to
any
pa
pils
nor
even
the
new
noble
pils
by
sa
i
see
people
rating
this
beer
a
4
or
better
and
i
just
dont
get
it
its
an
average
beer
and
a
below
average
pils
ps
tap
is
a
bit
better
d
probably
one
of
the
best
lawnmower
beers
out
there
but
nothing
more
than
that
d
very
drinkable
brew
here
hell
sierra
nevada
really
cannot
not
go
wrong
very
much
to
still
good
flavors
and
not
corning
like
most
of
the
other
out
there
good
pils
d
very
good
and
much
more
flavorful
than
i
was
expecting
recommended
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
soft
white
head
that
quickly
faded
into
so
pretty
nice
lacing
smells
like
summer
fresh
cut
hay
with
a
nice
hoppy
smell
think
i
picked
up
a
little
citrus
mixed
in
there
too
the
taste
is
very
impressive
spicy
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
malt
compliments
the
hops
perfectly
mouthfeel
was
a
solid
medium
drinkability
was
awesome
had
this
sitting
on
the
patio
of
the
local
bar
found
it
be
extremely
refreshing
and
plan
on
picking
some
up
for
a
cookout
coming
up
this
weekend
2010
crystal
clear
and
bright
gold
with
a
thin
white
cap
of
fine
bubbles
the
modest
collar
produced
some
sticky
spotty
lace
and
even
though
it
didnt
start
with
much
foam
what
was
there
lasted
for
a
long
time
the
aroma
was
full
of
spicy
and
lemony
hops
mild
malt
and
some
corn
sweetness
moderate
bitterness
and
fruity
sweetness
up
front
it
finished
with
a
combination
of
spicy
hops
sweet
malt
and
crisp
carbonation
light
bodied
without
feeling
thin
dry
without
being
harsh
quite
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
very
enjoyable
d
drinkable
as
a
lager
should
be
but
with
more
character
another
success
from
sierra
nevada
d
not
looking
forward
to
the
other
5
bottles
overall
doesnt
stand
out
too
much
and
there
are
a
lot
of
golden
ales
and
pilsners
out
there
this
one
sits
near
the
middle
with
the
lot
of
them
but
is
good
and
is
spot
on
for
the
style
but
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
pils
i
have
drank
i
dig
this
for
a
pils
dive
had
better
czech
pilseners
but
this
is
a
very
solid
effort
and
i
surely
wont
mind
finishing
off
the
six
pack
in
the
coming
weeks
golden
yellow
pour
light
clean
and
crisp
lemon
zest
and
wheat
flavors
predominately
as
well
as
hints
of
light
malt
round
out
the
flavor
profile
well
balanced
all
together
quenching
and
drinkable
but
light
on
flavor
a
well
defined
summer
seasonal
beer
cheers
eminently
drinkable
d
it
drinks
like
water
i
guess
if
i
wanted
to
drink
a
very
light
craft
brew
i
would
think
about
grabbin
one
there
are
just
so
many
others
that
i
would
go
for
before
this
honestly
i
dont
see
myself
revisiting
this
one
with
all
the
good
reviews
that
this
beer
has
i
guess
its
possible
that
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
maybe
i
will
pick
up
another
bottle
next
time
i
hit
up
a
shop
where
i
can
buy
a
single
d
who
couldnt
love
drinking
this
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
good
flavor
character
for
those
who
think
pilsners
are
lame
the
dryness
of
this
beer
leans
it
to
a
german
pils
and
the
hop
character
bears
that
out
hard
to
believe
such
a
big
ale
brewer
can
nail
the
pilsner
style
so
well
d
a
pretty
refreshing
and
good
tasting
lager
but
i
dont
really
ever
worry
about
sierra
nevada
when
it
comes
to
making
a
good
beer
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
sn
has
yet
to
let
me
down
as
a
brewery
i
will
try
another
batch
of
this
just
incase
i
got
a
pack
of
duds
this
is
a
really
good
perhaps
underrated
pils
thats
great
to
have
around
in
the
summer
great

drinkability
crisp

a

backed
up
by
the
perect

extremely
drinkable
and
delicious

is
very
light
and
sits
at
about
an

level

picked
up

pack

it
works
great
at
the

of
a
hot

beach
impression
lager
fans
you
need
to
try
this
if
you
havent
those
who
dont
care
for
lagers
may
be
surprised
to
like
this
one
a
must
try
judging
from
the
good
reviews
im
pretty
certain
my
summerfest
must
have
been
skunked
the
beer
i
taste
here
cant
hold
a
candle
to
pilsner
urquell
sierra
nevada
is
always
impressive
and
once
again
they
dont
dissapoint
treat
yourself
this
summer
and
tap
a
summerfest
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
1
finger
head
that
recedes
to
a
very
white
ring
smell
is
a
floral
citrus
bouquet
of
hops
and
malts
and
a
hint
of
spicetaste
is
the
same
its
a
floral

taste
off
set
with
some
bready
malts
it
tastes
good
its
crisp
and
clean
the
mouth
feel
is
mediumlight
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
good
pilslager
but
will
choose
primanoble
pils
and
czechvar
b4
this
one
for
the
style
sn
makes
great
brews
at
affordable
prices
and
this
one
is
no
exception
to
that
drink
well
my
friend
drinkability
a
great
pilsner
and
a
superb
summer
seasonal
i
could
see
myself
easily
drinking
several
of
these
on
a
warm
day
while
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
pilsners
i
used
to
drink
in
europe
sn
has
added
enough
of
its
own
touch
to
make
this
a
unique
and
highly
enjoyable
beer
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
goes
down
smooth
especially
on
a
warm
muggy
june
night
nothing
special
from
sierra
nevada
but
hit
the
mark
for
a
good
quality
easy
drinking
summer
lager
with
enough
hops
to
keep
you
interested
md
flavor
lingers
and
its
good
a
little
bit
of
grainy
flour
type
feel
as
well
as
some
slightly
spicy
hops
overall
a
really
clean
beer
that
a
newcomer
can
drink
and
not
thing
about
it
and
an
advocate
can
dissect
and
find
impressive
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
i
just
cant
figure
out
why
it
scores
so
low
d
great
summer
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
a
pilsner
had
this
beer
on
a
warm
spring
night
after
a
softball
game
the
beer
poured
clear
and
golden
with
crisp
carbonation
bubbling
up
a
nice
crisp
head
lasted
for
the
first
few
minutes
and
then
disappeared
very
little
aroma
coming
from
the
beer
the
beer
was
crisp
with
slightly
spicy
hops
a
decent
beer
for
my
palate
mouthfeel
was
nice
best
mouthfeel
ive
had
for
a
glass
of
water
and
sure
drinkability
was
good
after
all
were
like
6070
made
up
of
this
stuff
sierra
nevada
did
a
good
job
with
summerfest
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
incredibly
easy
drinking
beer
recommended
light
body
with
a
crisp
finnish
it
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
enjoying
a
bbq
drinkability
defenitely
a
summer
session
beer
to
be
paired
with
light
seafood
or
salad
better
for
the
end
of
the
day
beer
drink
than
the
just
got
done
mowing
the
lawn
beer
in
the
early
afternoon
this
one
drinks
really
good
good
session
beer
exspecailly
on
the
hot
summer
days
but
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
ill
prolly
avoid
this
in
the
future
and
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
highly
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
will
seek
this
out
again
as
this
is
an
excellent
summer
beer
that
went
down
very
easy
it
flows
down
so
nicely
and
ive
had
several
today
and
this
beer
was
consistently
good
all
day
and
into
the
night
another
fine
sierra
nevada
product
that
i
highly
recommend
light
body
with
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
clean
balanced
beer
very
drinkable
perhaps
a
bit
light
on
the
hop
flavor
d
perfect
for
that
trip
to
the
rope
swing
day
at
the
lake
or
beach
bbqs
sporting
events
etc
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
always
something
to
look
forward
to
in
the
summer
drinkability
is
stellar
perfectly
balanced
no
real
flaws
at
all
just
a
great
example
top
notch
light
grainy
aroma
with
just
a
touch
of
lemon
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
very
smooth
crisp
flavor
with
a
further
hint
of
lemon
and
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
profile
very
tasty
easydrinking
summer
pilsner
d
goes
down
very
nicely
2
of
these
after
a
nice
run
is
perfect
a
light
5
percent
makes
them
very
east
to
put
down
d
super
easy
to
drink
i
have
some
yard
work
to
do
so
over
the
course
of
the
day
i
dont
think
i
will
have
any
problem
finishing
the
6
of
them
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
light
straw
color
with
a
clean
one
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
malt
some
breadiness
and
slight
floral
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
and
fresh
it
is
a
hot
day
and
as
suggested
this
brew
is
fresh
crisp
and
clean
not
too
bold
and
there
is
a
moderate
bitter
after
taste
but
the
overall
feel
is
light
and
refreshing
i
think
there
are
better
beers
when
needing
your
thirst
quenched
as
the
bitter
after
taste
leaves
you
needing
to
take
another
drink
but
all
in
all
a
well
balanced
brew
i
like
this
beer
had
it
at
the
beach
the
other
day
and
it
was
quite
the
compliment
to
a
sunny
day
and
some
burgers
fresh
off
the
grill
drinkability
relatively
so
not
a
beer
that
you
would
get
excited
about
however
i
dont
think
i
will
be
getting
this
again
however
sierra
nevada
summerfest
lager
poured
a
bright
yellow
color
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
it
smelt
of
a
bit
of
hops
and
lemon
it
had
a
light
but
full
flavor
it
was
a
little
bit
hoppy
and
there
was
alot
of
lemon
flavors
as
well
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
overall
a
great
summer
beer
worth
a
try
d
again
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
its
not
going
to
challenge
your
palate
in
many
ways
but
its
far
superior
to
any
macro
lager
in
terms
of
quality
and
taste
i
could
definitely
kick
back
a
few
of
these
by
the
pool
or
at
a
cookout
from
appearances
and
smell
could
be
great
the
taste
is
very
good
and
close
to
the
standard
for
a
good
pilsner
but
is
ever
so
slightly
imbalanced
overly
bitter
and
lacks
the
mellow
hoppiness
of
the
very
best
pilsners
this
is
a
good
fallback
option
but
a
step
below
the
leaders
in
this
style
in
terms
of
drinkability
im
feeling
just
ok
about
it
although
the
abv
is
low
and
the
brew
is
definitely
lively
enough
to
keep
my
attention
i
feel
like
the
very
mellow
buttery
feel
may
get
monotonous
after
a
couple
in
this
case
i
think
a
more
assertive
carbonation
level
would
help
the
drinkability
still
a
great
summer
brew
that
i
enjoy
often
overall
what
a
great
couple
they
make
i
was
quite
impressed
with
how
well
the
crisp
and
mild
bodied
brew
cut
right
through
the
spiciness
after
every
bite
and
left
a
clean
and
refreshing
finish
with
a
pleasant
low
bitterness
the
malt
and
hop
aromas
arent
very
appealing
to
me
but
i
do
appreciate
the
smooth
full
flavor
and
aftertaste
that
summerfest
grants
the
palate
beer
has
a
grainy
taste
to
it
but
it
finishes
nicely
overall
just
a
plain
blank
slate
almost
a
palate
cleanser
there
is
nothing
special
or
interesting
about
this
beer
its
bland
easy
to
drink
though
serving
type
bottle
overall
impression
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
should
be
popping
up
in
those
how
do
i
convert
my
bmcloving
friends
threads
nice
backyard
brew
d
excellent
i
could
drink
this
all
summer
long
bottle
a
pleasant
golden
yellow
with
relatively
thin
head
light
citrus
and
hop
aroma
crisp
clean
balanced
flavor
with
somewhat
subtle
citurshop
taste
perfect
for
summer
time
drinking
refreshing
on
the
palate
not
built
to
be
a
big
beer
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
is
a
fine
summer
pilsener
noting
special
but
a
decent
offering
other
than
the
saaz
this
doesnt
seem
at
all
a
bohemian
pilsner
to
my
palate
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
pours
a
beautiful
clear
pale
yellow
with
an
initially
good
sized
creamy
head
that
is
too
brief
and
doesnt
leave
behind
much
lacing
the
smell
is
largely
of
bready
malts
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
from
the
saaz
in
the
background
summerfest
tries
to
walk
the
line
between
lightly
hopped
and
under
hopped
and
just
misses
the
mark
for
me
the
nose
hinted
at
it
but
a
few
sips
confirm
that
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
lacking
in
the
hops
department
yes
its
supposed
to
be
subtle
and
an
easy
drinking
summer
brew
but
im
not
asking
for
a
hop
bomb
here
im
just
asking
that
i
not
have
to
strain
to
notice
the
spicey
saaz
flavor
its
a
shame
too
because
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
not
too
carbonated
and
not
too
heavy
i
found
it
disappearing
from
my
glass
rather
quickly
if
summerfest
had
a
little
more
hop
presence
it
might
be
one
of
my
go
to
summer
beers
but
i
doubt
ill
be
revisiting
it
again
as
is
overall
not
bad
for
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
would
be
a
nice
picnic
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
sharing
i
wont
search
it
out
but
if
i
stumble
on
some
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
good
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
drinking
a
very
good
summer
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
slick
drinkability
is
high
as
it
should
be
for
this
type
of
beer
this
is
fine
for
the
style
but
its
a
style
im
not
too
crazy
about
still
ill
give
it
its
due
because
it
fits
the
stylistic
characteristics
immensely
quaffable
this
is
the
ideal
summer
lager
i
noticed
that
only
the
smell
dropped
from
my
previous
review
in
2008
as
they
say
the
olfactory
suffers
with
age
a
very
light
lager
here
has
a
pale
color
reminiscent
of
a
domestic
banquet
beer
however
the
taste
is
much
more
developed
light
citrus
and
full
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
the
lager
yeast
in
the
brew
which
while
not
unfavorable
is
unexpected
this
is
a
hot
weather
beer
one
to
be
enjoyed
while
sitting
in
the
shade
at
midday
or
around
the
bbq
another
plus
to
this
beer
is
the
decent
price
and
its
wide
availability
anywhere
one
can
find
regular
sierra
nevada
d
a
tasty
sessionable
brew
that
will
definitely
go
well
with
summer
weather
thirstquenching
and
light
but
has
enough
flavor
to
maintain
an
interesting
profile
d
a
good
pilsener
it
doesnt
stand
out
much
but
im
not
sure
its
supposed
to
not
a
terribly
exciting
beer
by
any
stretch
though
not
flawed
in
any
way
still
trying
to
figure
out
why
this
is
the
style
target
of
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
breweries
drinkability
works
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
which
is
the
main
point
of
this
beer
so
it
accomplishes
what
its
set
out
to
be
overall
ill
pick
up
a
six
or
two
every
year
even
during
the
hottest
of
summer
days
summerfest
a
crisp
summer
lager
is
a
bit
too
light
for
my
taste
a
nice
change
from
all
the
big
american
beers
i
had
over
the
winter
its
friendly
and
refreshing

beer
has
a
nice
refreshing
balance
of
sweetness
and
crispness
the
lemon
adds
a
light
tartness
to
the
slightly
sweet
malts
and
toasted
grains
it
is
flavorful
while
still
remaining
light
and
bright
decent
carbonation
without
being
fizzy
or
bubbly
crazy
high
drinkability
and
its
definitely
a
great
summer
beer
d
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
summertime
brew
sierra
nevada
provides
a
light
combination
of
malt
and
spiced
hops
to
create
the
pefect
brew
to
mow
the
lawn
to
yup
i
mowed
to
a
couple
of
these
you
can
definitly
have
several
of
these
while
embracing
the
omcoming
heat
d
a
new
brew
for
a
warm
day
id
have
another
as
long
as
the
weather
cooperates
pours
a
super
clear
light
golden
yellow
a
frothy
white
head
laces
the
glass
i
see
many
trails
of
carbonation
smell
is
sugary
sweet
with
a
whole
lotta
light
biscuit
taste
is
pleasantly
bitter
upfront
with
a
good
dash
of
hops
and
more
biscuit
to
back
it
up
spicy
finish
but
very
smooth
a
bit
of
complexity
for
a
pilsner
and
it
goes
appreciated
crisp
as
the
label
says
it
is
and
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
for
a
warm
evening
very
good
i
dont
regret
purchasing
a
sixer
and
im
sure
a
few
more
will
follow
easy
drinker
great
for
a
summer
day
the
best
american
brewed
pilsener
ive
encountered
the
saaz
hops
really
sing
yet
balance
is
maintained
throughout
a
quality
take
on
the
style
although
i
found
the
malt
flavors
a
bit
harsh
in
the
finish
absolutely
drinkable
im
glad
i
can
get
them
in
the
12pack
at
a
slightly
better
price
would
recommend
d
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
not
too
carbonated
not
to
hoppy
not
too
citrusy
though
im
not
sure
thats
a
word
could
consume
seven
seas
worth
of
this
beer
amazing
i
just
bought
my
first
case
of
the
year
2010
tonight
i
was
very
impressed
with
it
not
your
typical
sn
offering
because
the
hops
are
a
bit
muted
to
be
honest
this
reminds
me
of
what
a
good
every
day
american
beer
should
be
like
unfortunately
here
in
pa
with
tax
it
costs
36
a
case
so
not
the
best
choice
for
an
every
day
beer
color
is
a
lovely
golden
hue
nice
head
on
it
although
not
nearly
as
thick
as
their
standard
pale
ale
smelll
is
light
crisp
sharp
taste
is
a
very
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
really
smooth
grainy
is
a
good
word
to
use
to
describe
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
fine
just
right
this
is
an
almost
perfect
beer
for
those
warmweather
days
a
reasonable
abv
5
so
you
can
drink
a
few
and
still
maintain
a
coherent
conversation
with
your
buddies
this
is
good
tasting
beer
i
think
this
is
what
a
regular
beer
should
taste
like
hot
summer
day
beer
and
a
good
session
beer
taste
features
an
upfront
hopsweetness
with
nice
malt
mellowing
not
too
dry
light
bitterness
lingers
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
effervescent
as
expected
but
seems
to
block
some
flavor
i
suspect
is
there
more
than
it
seems
more
lively
than
some
of
the
czech
pils
ive
have
before
but
this
is
still
more
american
than
euro
a
nice
effort
quite
drinkable
i
might
slalom
between
the
anchor
summer
wheat
and
this
one
hot
day
next
month
drinkability
is
very
good
another
good
summer
beer
that
goes
down
easily
simple
lager
done
well
fills
that
nice
niche
where
you
want
a
light
beer
for
the
patio
that
still
has
the
right
flavours
kinda
tastes
like
a
kolsch
with
that
very
pale
colour
coupled
with
pleasant
hops
on
the
nose
slightly
dry
finish
and
solid
midbody
make
this
a
winner
not
as
hoppy
as
prima
pils
but
still
more
european
in
attitude
than
some
us
lagers
light
in
body
without
being
thin
the
carb
is
nice
and
packing
a
punch
without
numbing
the
tip
of
the
tounge
goes
down
all
to
easy
quite
a
drinker
f
semi
bitter
little
lager
sweet
malt
taste
but
dries
a
bit
toasty
malts
light
malts
slight
lingering
sweetness
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
hop
characters
but
maybe
a
bit
heavy
in
the
overall
hop
profile
for
a
summer
beer
and
czech
pilsner
had
ontap
probably
would
not
have
considered
trying
but
it
was
on
special
for
happy
hour
pilsner
type
taste
and
feel
straw
yellow
in
appearance
clean
crisp
smell
and
taste
excellent
mouthfeel
some
carbonation
but
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
very
drinkable
would
definitely
try
again
especially
on
a
hot
day
great
session
beer
drinkability
a
decent
czech
pilsner
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
a

s

i
enjoy
this
beer
but
its
a
bit
expensive
i
usually
will
have
34
beers
a
night
when
i
drink
but
i
am
done
after
one
of
these
and
dont
want
anymore
i
am
going
to
try
another
one
tomorrow
and
see
if
i
come
to
the
same
conclusion
i
may
have
gotten
an
oldbad
batch
as
this
is
definitely
not
crisp
or
refreshing
overall
like
a
stella
without
the
bite
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
here
its
a
no
frills
easy
to
drink
beer
i
could
pound
these
allnight
d
very
drinkable
would
be
a
great
session
beer
regardless
of
season
and
with
any
meal
style
that
i
can
think
of
probably
great
with
baked
or
grilled
fish
d
pretty
drinkable
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
seems
to
me
a
good
summer
pilsner
option
though
light
refreshing
enough
body
to
keep
my
taste
buds
interested
and
certainly
refreshing
enough
for
a
hot
day
i
plan
to
buy
a
sixer
of
it
and
probably
go
through
a
few
on
a
nice
day
for
sure
when
i
had
picked
this
up
it
had
just
been
delivered
so
was
very
fresh
had
a
great
hop
aroma
the
typical
pilsnersaaz
hop
notes
were
there
along
with
some
definite
light
citrus
went
down
super
smooth
was
able
to
taste
the
pils
malts
and
again
with
the
american
hops
was
foruntate
to
have
the
sixer
all
to
myself
that
evening
as
everyone
else
was
into
their
macrobrews
having
this
beer
in
hand
while
playing
bags
and
eating
good
food
on
a
warm
night
is
what
summer
is
all
about
i
definitely
need
to
get
this
when
its
in
season
i
can
see
the
potential
now
because
it
isnt
a
horrible
beer
right
now
even
when
its
a
bit
skunky
ill
give
it
another
shot
and
rereview
later
this
one
was
likely
a
little
old
when
i
got
it
i
have
my
comments
in
a
notebook
pours
a
yellowish
color
aroma
was
rather
skunky
so
i
am
guessing
light
got
to
it
the
flavor
was
much
like
the
smell
caramel
malts
within
the
brew
are
a
little
heavy
but
i
have
come
to
expect
that
of
many
micros
d
good
beer
for
in
between
styles
as
it
is
not
a
palate
wrecker
this
beer
would
be
a
good
start
for
bmc
people
looking
to
go
into
the
craft
world
drinkability
ok
summer
beer
does
not
fit
my
choice
in
so
cal
probably
works
in
chico
i
am
good
for
one
of
sn
summerfest
drinkability
as
mentioned
before
this
beer
exceptionally
refreshing
and
would
definitely
see
drinking
this
on
a
nice
summer
day
pretty
drinkable
would
be
great
at
lunch
outdoors
on
a
sunny
summer
day
the
first
hit
is
a
slight
grassy
bitterness
that
ends
with
a
light
cereal
grains
flavor
the
flavor
is
that
of
a
pretty
good
lager
it
feel
like
some
saaz
hops
or
something
similar
are
used
giving
a
pretty
solid
traditional
flavor
imo
the
mouth
feel
is
frothy
and
solid
no
problems
here
overall
and
especially
for
the
price
i
got
this
sn
summerfest
is
a
solid
lager
if
thats
what
cha
looking
for
big
creamy
white
head
bright
golden
body
nose
is
predominantly
hops
with
a
touch
of
malts
the
taste
is
quite
refreshing
crisp
and
cool
the
carbonation
is
abundant
and
refreshing
not
too
much
taste
going
on
but
then
again
it
is
a
summer
lager
so
im
not
expecting
much
more
than
the
hop
and
malt
combination
they
are
giving
me
great
drinkablity
could
see
drinkin
a
couple
of
these
just
not
sn
best
beer
seems
like
it
is
missing
something
nothing
real
great
or
standout
from
this
beer
drinkability
if
it
werent
for
the
high
carbonation
it
would
be
a
good
alternative
to
the
sa
summer
beer
but
its
not
very
drinkable
to
me
this
feels
prickly
and
coarse
and
is
cleansing
to
the
palate
overall
a
great
example
of
the
czech
pilsner
style
from
a
great
brewing
company
poured
into
an
american
pint
glass
very
yellowgold
with
good
carbonation
but
a
thin
white
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
was
lackluster
with
just
a
subtle
hint
of
lemon
and
some
herbalgrassy
notes
the
taste
was
the
same
with
a
slightly
more
pronounced
herbal
presence
rather
than
citrus
the
mouthfeel
was
a
pleasantly
thin
carbonated
brew
certainly
refreshing
for
a
lawnmower
beer
and
definitely
sessionable
however
it
does
need
some
more
flavor
md
definitely
a
quaffer
on
a
hot
summer
day
some
graininess
and
hints
of
corn
come
out
at
the
end
when
it
warms
up
so
its
best
to
drink
this
quick
on
the
colder
side
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
at
first
glance
this
really
looked
like
a
typical
macro
to
me
and
that
would
really
be
my
only
complaint
not
sure
why
it
tasted
so
off
at
first
but
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
it
just
took
some
time
for
me
to
notice
the
hop
presence
which
usually
isnt
an
issue
with
sn
overall
this
was
very
refreshing
and
i
can
see
this
as
a
good
thing
to
have
on
a
hot
day
the
main
thing
that
would
hinder
me
from
picking
this
up
again
is
that
when
i
think
of
sn
this
isnt
anywhere
near
the
top
of
my
list
still
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
so
i
have
to
give
credit
to
sn
for
another
quality
brew
d
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
still
there
are
better
out
there
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
all
that
special
though
it
is
a
really
good
beer
for
the
summer
obviously
that
is
the
goal
here
but
other
than
at
a
bbq
for
the
summer
i
probably
wont
get
this
again
it
poured
crisp
and
clean
not
much
of
a
head
but
a
nice
clean
golden
yellow
color
it
had
what
i
usually
associate
with
the
lager
smell
very
nice
even
had
a
clean
lager
smell
not
too
danky
it
is
very
light
it
was
like
drinking
a
commercial
style
pilsner
but
obviously
better
the
mouthfeel
is
drier
with
a
bit
of
bitter
hop
aftertaste
i
would
love
having
this
on
a
hot
day
after
work
after
youve
been
running
around
all
day
just
sit
in
the
lawn
chair
or
if
you
really
got
style
the
davenporch
and
relax
with
one
of
these
drinkability
please
mass
produce
this
beer
great
break
from
my
usual
big
beer
sessions
md
a
slight
dryness
and
lots
of
carbonation
tingle
definitely
drinkable
and
works
very
well
as
a
summertime
brew
i
would
recommend
this
one
but
not
over
their
wheat
ale
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
easy
to
drink
pils
definitely
no
frills
but
solid
drinkability
great
wishing
i
had
picked
up
some
more
i
was
pissed
initially
when
i
arrived
at
home
and
noticed
this
was
the
08
vintage
all
it
took
was
one
sip
to
change
my
mind
d
very
drinkable
just
like
you
want
a
lager
to
be
but
still
flavorful
enough
to
be
enjoyed
as
more
than
just
a
lawnmower
beer
poured
into
a
glass
had
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
some
lacing
kind
of
sticky
smell
of
some
slight
hops
not
very
strong
had
some
after
tastes
of
wheat
maybe
some
hay
taste
was
very
mediocre
at
best
some
wheat
to
it
with
a
slight
hop
finish
again
not
a
strong
flavor
mouthfeel
was
pretty
decent
had
a
nice
crisp
feel
to
it
finishes
a
little
dry
at
the
end
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
quite
refreshing
overall
despite
the
lack
of
flavor
if
you
know
somebody
who
is
trying
to
get
into
more
quality
breweries
and
cant
seem
to
find
any
they
like
this
may
be
worth
a
shot
i
really
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
ever
try
it
again
though
personally
i
really
love
this
stuff
one
of
the
best
pilsners
made
in
the
us
drinks
very
easily
i
might
just
drink
the
whole
six
tonight
overall
this
is
a
good
refreshing
lawnmower
type
beer
nothing
particularly
special
about
it
but
a
good
solid
brew
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
nonetheless
easy
drinker
especially
with
the
101
degree
day
we
had
today
great
clean
and
crisp
taste
perfect
for
summer
slightly
dry
but
refreshing
although
this
is
lighter
beer
it
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
gotten
this
earlier
in
the
summer
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
nice
golden
color
with
a
slight
head
i
was
not
getting
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
just
a
light
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
dry
and
crisp
with
a
nice
hop
bite
at
the
end
very
nice
on
a
hot
st
louis
summer
day
easy
to
drink
and
goes
nice
with
light
summer
foods
d
a
very
solid
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
a
summer
day
drinkable
all
day
long
a
very
good
beer
for
this
time
of
year
d
definitely
drinkable
in
large
quantities
although
very
light
in
flavor
and
body
it
is
very
crisp
and
clean
if
american
adjunct
lagers
and
light
lagers
had
any
knowledge
of
how
to
make
a
good
beer
this
would
be
the
model
like
a
lot
of
the
other
reviews
i
dont
find
this
to
be
a
good
czech
pils
but
it
is
a
very
refreshing
summer
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
for
an
afternoon
a
good
overall
beer
this
a
pretty
drinkable
summer
beer
not
really
the
best
czech
ive
had
but
i
looked
on
the
bottle
it
doesnt
really
have
that
word
anyway
just
lager

this

this
is
a

offering
not
worth
you
time
its
not
quenching
or
refreshing
imo
overall
a
nice
drinkable
czech
pils
md
lively
but
still
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
with
a
mediumplus
hoppiness
in
support
of
the
overall
malty
flavour
upfront
although
in
the
end
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
gradually
prevails
this
is
a
decent
lager
overall
d
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
made
this
beer
a
fairly
drinkable
one
definitely
a
nice
summer
beer
i
picked
this
up
really
cheap
on
sale
for
less
than
six
bucks
at
that
price
combined
with
the
easydrinking
tastiness
makes
for
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
in
my
book
at
that
price
though
sn
pale
ale
seemed
a
better
deal
like
i
was
getting
more
flavor
and
enjoyment
for
my
money
this
beer
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
mind
if
everything
was
notched
up
just
a
little
bit
d
easy
drinking
if
bland
this
might
not
be
a
bad
brew
for
hanging
with
friends
outside
but
overall
its
kinda
boring
what
more
can
i
say
the
beer
is
fairly
tasteless
and
i
drink
beer
in
park
for
taste
if
i
was
at
a
bar
and
it
was
either
this
or
macro
lagers
id
probably
take
the
macro
lager
because
the
price
doesnt
add
up
to
the
taste
very
disappointing
drinkability
had
a
very
good
drinkability
it
was
light
and

like
a

be

could

have
many
of
these
this
is
where
the
main
appeal
of
this
type
of
beer
comes
from
and
it
was
good
here
i
didnt
love
the
beer
itself

opened

with

as

its
a
nice
americanbrewed
pilsner
thats
commonly
available
when
in
season
theres
nothing
spectacular
here
its
hardly
my
favorite
sierra
nevada
beer
twist
top
but
the
hops
are
out
of
place
for
that
style
too
suffice
it
to
say
that
this
beer
doesnt
fit
a
category
well
clean
hops
and
grassiness
is
all
i
taste
but

with

of

sweet
and
sticky
while
in
the
mouth
biscuit
and
maybe
vienna
malt
is
late
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
touch
tinlike
but
mostly
wiped
clean
by
the
strong
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
mdlight
and
the
beer
leaves
quickly
due
to
the
carbonation
leaves
a
touch
of
sour
and
i
get
some
heartburn
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nicely
done
summer
beer
light
and
refreshing
quite
hoppy
i
never
would
have
purchased
this
one
myself
as
i
would
have
expected
it
to
be
a
wheat
beer
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
hopbomb
of
a
germanish
summer
quencher
this
is
a
beer
that
i
recommend
review
scores
are

it
is

and
easy
to

this

a

it
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
and
i
think
that
a
macro
drinker
would
probably
be
able
to
get
into
this
beer
mostly
because
of

it

from

at

out
to
a

golden

that
left
broken

fairly
rich

i
could
enjoy
this
one
as
a
decent

but
in
a
similar
slightly
more
sublte
way
this
is
a

beer
there
are
not
a
lot
of
flavors
that
jump
out
at
you
but
rather
begin
to
blend
to
form
a
very
well
balanced
fuller
bodied
beer
its
a

lovers
summer
brew
the
taste
is

giving
it

this

with

of
tingle
on

to
go
with

its
quite
a

what
maybe
a

i

ive
ever
had
i
just
bought
my
third
half
liter
can
and
can
tell
you
this
beer
is
amazing
i
guess
the
long
trip
in
the
bottles
was
not
good
for
the
beer
if
you
tried
this
one
in
the
past
and
thought
it
tasted
off
buy
it
in
the
can
and
pour
it
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
experience
is
amazing
i
love
this
beer
ever
since
i
first
tasted
it
in
new
york
of
all
places
when
i
came
home
to
ireland
and
found
it
was
available
i
was
overjoyed
ive
since
drunk
it
on
draught
in
pragueand
it
was
even
better
for
me
it
has
a
lovely
combination
of
malt
and
hops
an
ideal
balance
which
brings
me
back
to
it
time
and
again
12
oz
bottle
from
trader
joes
the
nose
gives
off
a
slight
whiff
of
skunk
that
doesnt
come
through
in
the
taste
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
fizzles
down
to
a
thin
cap
tasty
pilsen
malt
sweetness
transitions
to
saaz
hops
bitterness
good
carbonation
excellent
balance
a
crisp
and
refreshing
pilsner
love
the
low
abv
crisp
clean
has
never
disappointed
especially
in
current
cans
still
sets
the
standard
have
not
found
an
american
pilsner
that
compares
not
a
good
tasting
beer
uhhgg
drinkable
but
a
little
too
adjuncty
is
that
a
word
a
dry
and
bitter
aftertaste
that
just
doesnt
quit
not
pleasant
to
drink
with
good
food
overall
this
is
one
of
the
first
pilsners
i
have
tasted
that
i
actually
liked
maybe
its
because
its
the
original
from
europe
who
knows
but
i
think
this
beer
is
better
than
it
is
rated
i
would
absolutely
recommend
this
brew
to
someone
and
i
will
buy
it
again
bitter
from
start
to
finish
had
it
on
draft
in
prague
a
pretty
hoppy
pilsner
that
i
found
delicious
cheaper
than
water
too
oeasy
drinking
session
beer
definitely
have
had
better
pilasters
probably
one
of
the
best
imported
beers
available
in
stores
here
in
indiana
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
a
big
frothy
head
not
too
much
hops
in
the
aroma
its
mostly
biscuity
malt
the
flavor
reflects
the
smell
as
well
has
a
biscuity
flavor
with
earthy
tones
and
the
hops
are
present
but
not
too
noticeable
the
mouth
feel
is
very
light
almost
water
like
overall
very
crisp
and
refreshing
crystal
clear
yellow
body
smells
bready
and
has
a
lagery
smell
taste
is
like
bready
malts
cheap
beer
and
a
hint
of
some
spicy
hops
body
is
just
okay
overall
a
good
benchmark
for
the
style
lovely
look
although
the
head
fades
too
quicklyalbeit
with
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
delicious
aroma
of
clean
saaz
hops
totally
balanced
solid
feel
going
down
one
gets
from
the
real
thing
on
tap
in
prague
great
beer
noweven
in
the
bottled
version
the
best
pilsner
beer
i
have
tried
very
hoppy
which
i
really
love
adds
a
superb
bitterness
and
really
makes
your
moutj
come
alive
not
very
fruity
but
packed
with
the
flavours
of
the
malts
they
use
you
get
a
lot
of
dry
apple
on
the
nose
with
the
malt
and
hay
smell
it
almost
combines
in
to
a
sort
of
citrus
tomato
hybrid
not
very
appealing
at
least
to
me
crisp
feel
but
not
much
flavor
outside
old
apple
and
malt
it
may
have
once
been
an
originator
but
it
certainly
has
been
surpassed
by
many
other
pilsners
bought
a
12
pack
of
this
in
the
brown
bottles
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
frothy
head
smells
of
grain
with
a
hops
overtone
a
very
tasty
pilsner
with
biscuity
malt
backed
up
by
a
noticeable
hoppiness
no
adjunct
flavors
coming
into
play
a
solid
pilsner
probably
the
best
ive
had
leaves
me
wanting
another
this
is
a
really
pleasant
change
from
the
hop
bombs
i
usually
drink
and
at
4
4
its
pretty
sessionable
much
better
than
the
so
called
session
brews
that
everyone
seems
to
be
brewing
these
days
definitely
worth
a
try
o
the
beat
pilsner
ever
when
you
imagine
the
taste
of
beer
this
is
it
classic
the
motherhood
of
european
lager
beer
gave
the
name
pilsener
from
czech
city
of
pilsen
tried
the
beer
on
location
as
draft
beer
almost
could
hear
the
angels
sing
as
a
bottled
beer
anywhere
in
the
world
it
looses
some
of
its
freshness
and
hoppyness
but
is
still
one
of
the
best
lagers
in
the
world
ohh
these
saaz
hops
very
bitter
but
smooth
and
without
the
american
cascade
hops
harsh
taste
think
something
may
have
been
off
with
the
keg
had
a
soured
mildew
towel
aroma
hands
down
the
best
pilsner
ever
very
consistent
through
the
decades
ive
tried
it
im
shocked
by
the
low
ratings
this
is
truly
a
world
class
pilsner
4

foul
taste
and
smell
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
beer
features
aromatic
herbal
hops
infused
throughout
with
a
smell
of
bread
and
wet
earth
crisp
and
clean
with
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
finish
there
is
a
distinct
definitive
bitterness
to
the
brew
but
never
overwhelming
making
it
quite
pleasant
even
to
those
who
might
dislike
much
hoppiness
in
their
beer
like
me
if
you
want
to
see
how
hops
can
be
used
to
enhance
a
beer
but
hate
their
usual
presence
in
such
brews
as
india
pale
ales
this
is
a
fine
example
my
favorite
beer
think
its
still
the
best
mass
produced
pilsnerlager
available
in
the
us
would
rate
higher
for
the
tankova
version
found
in
the
czech
republic
the
new
brown
bottles
and
cans
if
you
can
find
give
you
the
reminiscence
of
being
in
prague
check
the
bottling
code
and
just
make
sure
youre
buying
fresh
the
original
pilsener
beer
truly
pleasant
bitter
taste
with
fresh
aroma
of
hops
goes
great
with
greasy
czech
cuisine
doctors
recommend
this
beer
for
stomach
acidity
as
this
is
one
of
the
bitter
beers
which
soothe
your
stomach
final
thoughts
really
like
the
level
of
bitterness
present
here
it
is
quite
above
that
of
other
mainstream
beers
of
the
style
if
it
wasnt
for
the
offflavor
here
and
there
this
would
be
excellent
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
wonderful
hoppy
pilsner
that
makes
a
great
aperitif
this
beer
reminded
me
of
heineken
but
minus
the
after
taste
very
smooth
big
fan
of
this
beer
clean
crisp
pilsner
east
drinking
a
true
standard
by
which
to
compare
future
pilsners
delicious
crisp
last
sip
leaves
me
wanting
more
ive
had
the
bottle
and
just
recently
i
had
the
draft
it
almost
seems
like
2
different
beers
unlike
the
bottle
the
draft
is
served
with
a
good
head
on
it
the
entry
tones
are
a
little
different
but
the
finish
its
the
same
i
still
like
this
bad
boy
and
couldnt
believe
the
draft
version
would
be
so
different
if
its
available
in
your
area
give
it
a
shot
a
classic
style
good
not
great
a
little
musky
maybe
the
one
i
opened
drank
was
different
but
i
found
it
very
flat
the
original
pilsen
style
although
still
known
as
a
12
degree
beer
in
the
czech
republic
careful
inspection
of
brewing
information
reveals
it
is
something
closer
to
a
11
5
degree
beerthough
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
local
who
would
tell
you
this
i
used
to
work
with
one
of
the
marketing
managers
here
in
prague
not
my
first
one
but
i
did
actually
expected
less
from
it
this
time
if
looking
at
some
reviews
it
is
not
a
complex
beer
and
you
can
feel
a
kind
of
artificiality
to
it
but
still
didnt
found
any
real
flaws
at
all
the
path
to
mass
production
doesnt
seem
to
be
that
dramatic
and
i
could
drink
this
beer
any
day
often
skunky
due
to
green
bottle
tastes
better
during
the
summer
months
overall
classic
pilsner
enough
said
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
and
its
good
enough
and
light
enough
that
you
may
very
well
decide
to
have
more
after
your
foods
long
gone
if
not
for
the
fact
that
i
only
have
half
a
sixpack
left
in
my
fridge
i
honestly
could
go
for
a
third
one
right
now
id
say
its
definitely
worth
the
price
for
the
6
and
12
packs
that
you
can
easily
find
in
grocery
stores
at
first
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
to
not
pick
up
any
lemony
flavors
here
like
i
did
in
the
other
pilsner
ive
tried
bohemia
but
after
having
a
couple
more
of
them
i
dont
think
the
absence
of
lemony
flavors
hurts
this
too
muchtheres
just
so
much
else
going
for
it
especially
the
clearly
defined
biscuitcracker
flavors
and
the
way
it
feels
to
drink
some
when
the
foams
still
hanging
around
on
top
is
still
a
standard
for
this
style
of
beer
clear
lively
and
accented
by
hops
this
is
still
a
quality
beer
o
the
original
pilsner
beer
so
tasty
and
clean
please
try
this
if
you
havent
already
the
best
pilsner
in
the
world
enter
your
reviewoptional
really
means
optional
golden
cloudy
like
the
summer
sun
on
the
fields
on
a
humid
day
nice
hop
aroma
and
slightly
bitter
pours
nicely
and
you
can
limit
the
head
what
american
beer
should
taste
like
i
love
this
beer
overall
this
really
is
a
great
beer
and
its
clear
to
see
how
many
american
pilsners
have
copied
the
model
of
this
beer
surprisingly
hoppy
and
bitter
which
is
really
accentuated
with
the
dryness
of
the
malt
still
not
many
beers
can
balance
hop
flavor
light
body
and
crispclean
finish
like
this
beer
does
need
more
of
this
especially
in
cans
i
like
this
beer
and
will
look
forward
to
my
next
drink
aroma
is
fairly
sweet
and
grainy
with
floral
notes
and
a
hint
of
skunk
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
malty
initially
finishing
with
a
bitter
slightly
harsh
earthy
bite
theres
an
underlying
diacetyl
character
floral
tones
surface
as
it
warms
im
surprised
at
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
the
skunk
comes
out
in
flavor
as
well
world
clas
pils
and
the
first
one
ever
this
beer
needs
to
be
rated
higher
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
even
though
im
drinking
during
winter
only
pils
that
compares
is
könig
pours
a
bright
straw
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
decent
lacing
herbal
hop
aroma
as
expected
with
this
style
of
beer
flavor
is
dominated
by
these
hops
with
some
grains
in
the
background
decent
carbonation
level
and
very
clean
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
quite
neutral
with
some
hop
flavor
lingering
overall
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
but
not
quite
how
i
remember
it
from
many
years
ago
very
easy
to
drink
the
color
looks
great
i
picked
this
up
a
few
days
ago
and
so
far
ive
been
pleased
with
it
i
love
crisp
beers
and
this
definitely
fits
the
bill
good
but
not
great
on
tap
cold
on
the
pint
glass
this
is
the
essential
pilsner
style
clean
crisp
golden
with
hints
of
the
herbal
saaz
there
are
only
a
few
beers
that
come
close
like
the
budejovicky
that
they
maintained
this
high
standard
through
the
communist
years
is
a
miracle
showing
the
love
of
czech
craftsmanship
in
the
bottle
it
does
not
match
the
tap
as
so
many
beers
excellent
sharp
taste
good
colour
and
a
low
abv
very
refreshing
pilsner
i
have
this
on
tap
in
my
pub
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
i
love
the
saaz
hops
from
bohemian
and
moravia
regions
this
is
a
beer
i
can
drink
everyday
an
easy
drinking
beer
which
has
a
simple
taste
and
lacks
complication
making
it
somewhat
flat
nevertheless
its
one
of
the
better
mass
produced
czech
style
pilsners
available
in
north
america
session
beer
look
no
further
i
didnt
taste
or
notice
the
booze
in
this
and
only
when
i
could
feel
the
gas
in
me
did
i
realize
that
was
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
my
glass
while
this
was
just
a
bit
too
sour
or
acidic
for
me
i
can
see
why
people
enjoy
this
beer
and
look
to
it
as
a
standard
it
doesnt
have
the
best
aftertaste
but
the
appearance
and
crispness
of
the
mouthfeel
more
than
make
up
for
it
and
like
any
other
hallmark
this
is
a
beer
that
deserves
a
go
at
least
once
if
nothing
more
than
to
expand
ones
palate
smells
lightly
of
saaz
grassy
and
a
bit
spicy
plus
some
crackers
and
biscuits
i
tasted
a
pleasant
grassy
tingle
up
front
the
went
well
with
the
biscuity
maltiness
the
finish
was
unpleasant
though
unclean
sweetness
that
frankly
tasted
adjuncty
this
came
in
a
brown
bottle
and
was
relatively
fresh
it
still
wasnt
very
good
though

very
good
head
lacing
and
retention
mild
nose
of
light
biscuit
with
a
touch
of
saaz
hop
aroma
and
spiciness
as
it
warms
the
hops

more
forward
light
medium
body
with
a
somewhat
slick
oily
texture
above
normal
carbonation
with
good
effervescence
on
the
finish
and
also
in
the
middle
very
well
done
and
it
allows
the
saaz
hops
to
really
shine
in
the
middle
the
flavor
profile
is
intense
for
a
pilsner
well
balanced
and
has
a
bit
of
complexity
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
saaz
hop
flavor
over
a
light
biscuit
sweetness
the
middle
is
saaz
both
in
flavor
and
bitterness
over
a
balanced
sweetness
the
finish
is
quite
crisp
a
touch
dry
and
leaves
you
with
a
lingering
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
and
spice
about
30
years
ago
i
had
this
fresh
on
draft
and
it
was
world
class
over
the
years
it
has
suffered
in
quality
but
the
brown
bottle
now
helps
move
it
towards
its
past
greatness
also
kudos
on
the
new
brown
glass
bottles
overall
a
4
75
for
pilsner
urquell
plzensky
prazdroj
a
s
now
i
see
what
all
the
talk
is
about
with
this
brew
despite
it
being
3
months
past
the
drink
by
date
this
turned
out
to
be
a
great
pick
i
will
certainly
buy
this
brew
again
overall
this
is
a
very
good
quality
beer
that
i
enjoyed
a
lot
and
it
really
deserves
a
higher
rating
im
sure
the
current
rating
is
due
to
shitty
packaging
and
freshness
issues
which
pu
is
currently
working
to
correct
i
have
no
complaints
at
all
about
the
can
i
just
had
this
beer
fits
a
lot
of
tasty
pils
flavor
into
just
4
4
abv
the
green
bottles
dont
do
this
beer
any
favors
would
love
to
have
this
fresh
at
the
source
light
grain
flavor
with
some
grassiness
from
the
hops
i
think
the
shipping
process
doesnt
do
the
beer
any
favors
flavors
are
a
bit
dull
cheap
and
it
taste
like
it
needed
something
crisper
and
better
than
a
domestic
for
drinking
during
the
game
this
was
the
choice
not
sure
what
it
says
about
it
besides
that
its
better
than
bud
light
pilsner
urquell
may
not
be
the
best
czech
pilsner
in
the
world
but
it
certainly
is
old
school
bright
and
delicious
the
grain
bill
is
crisp
the
lemon
note
vibrant
and
the
noble
hopping
delectable
this
beer
cannot
be
beat
for
the
price
brilliantly
engineered
pilsner
that
is
absolutely
true
to
style
and
quaffable
pours
perfectly
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
head
perhaps
a
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
it
does
not
defray
from
the
mouthfeel
the
beer
starts
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
transitions
to
a
slightly
malty
sweetness
then
transitions
yet
again
to
a
hop
finish
the
combination
of
pilsen
malt
and
saaz
hops
provides
the
perfect
balance
that
is
so
difficult
to
achieve
in
this
style
this
beer
must
be
poured
from
the
miserable
green
bottles
into
a
pilsner
glass
or
a
standard
pint
glass
to
achieve
the
aromatics
and
full
taste
profile
i
will
keep
looking
but
there
may
not
be
a
better
pils
thus
the
5
is
still
to
be
distributed
and
the
hunt
will
continue

gold
yellow
i
prefer
in
summer
henkmudijul
24
it
skunk
but
i
call
it
just
right
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
with
a
nice
biter
kick
on
the
end
i
have
enjoyed
this
equally
from
bottle
can
on
tap
in
us
and
czech
republic
i
watched
the
movie
somm
and
they
talk
about
freshly
opened
can
of
tennis
balls
being
the
big
new
thing
in
aromas
with
this
beer
its
more
like
a
freshly
opened
box
of
tennis
shoes
thats
been
worn
a
few
times
before
totally
nasty
will
not
be
trying
this
again
and
likely
throwing
the
remaining
5
5
bottles
out
crisp
clean
taste
with
a
smooth
texture
nice
tight
foamy
head
no
lingering
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
do
prefer
the
bottle
over
the
can
but
unfortunately
the
can
seems
to
hold
preference
in
our
retail
setting
in
nova
scotia
one
of
my
long
time
favourites
on
draught
in
the
old
punchbowl
booterstown
dublin
its
served
in
glass
tankards
light
gold
in
colour
with
a
thick
white
head
the
pilsner
urquell
has
the
mouthfeel
of
a
good
lager
but
has
extra
notes
of
hops
malt
and
sweet
breads
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
a
refreshing
and
uncomplicated
beer
it
ticks
all
the
boxes
and
gets
it
right
ive
also
drank
the
cask
pulled
pilsner
urquell
and
i
would
rate
it
higher
than
draught
keg
version
with
less
carbonation
and
a
greater
depth
of
flavour
this
to
me
is
the
epitome
of
a
czech
pilsner
the
color
is
a
bit
darker
than
other
pilsner
beers
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
i
found
these
babies
in
a
four
pack
of
tall
boys
which
i
found
as
a
nice
surprise
i
have
drank
this
beer
numerous
times
over
the
years
but
since
i
found
this
in
cans
i
thought
i
would
give
this
one
a
review
its
got
a
bit
of
that
skunk
but
that
is
what
you
expect
from
this
beer
i
was
turned
on
to
numerous
other
beers
after
trying
this
one
years
ago
and
it
proved
that
there
was
other
and
better
beers
out
there
beyond
what
the
american
big
guys
were
producing
still
among
my
favorites
and
the
review
is
probably
a
bit
higher
than
it
should
be
but
its
a
solid
beer
and
if
you
can
find
this
four
pack
of
tall
boys
you
should
give
it
a
go
the
price
is
reasonable
and
the
beer
is
high
quality
for
the
style
meh
this
meets
most
of
the
criteria
for
the
bohemian
pilsner
except
for
the
absence
of
a
good
head
notes
far
from
the
memories
of
draft
tasted
at
the
brewery
in
plzen
during
the
1990s
but
currently
much
better
in
cans
than
earlier
green
bottles
o
definitely
a
drinkable
beverage
but
not
one
id
visit
solely
for
enjoyment
this
is
best
paired
with
food
and
outdoor
activities
served
its
purpose
well
at
a
bbq
after
a
long
day
of
work
enjoy
taste
is
crisp
with
the
firm
grassy
bitterness
of
noble
hops
dry
grassy
notes
linger
in
the
aftertaste
light
clover
honey
and
sawn
wood
from
the
malt
base
plain
and
simple
seemingly
though
it
has
subtle
nuance
light
bodied
crisp
and
clean
easy
to
drink
several
on
a
hot
day
much
better
than
the
skunky
green
bottles
of
yesteryear
hope
they
phase
those
out
a
simple
classic
czech
pilsner
an
excellent
beer
for
its
kind
at
the
first
few
sips
the
bitter
finish
and
aftertaste
gradually
builds
so
that
by
the
last
quarter
of
a
bottle
i
dont
care
to
finish
it
this
would
have
been
among
my
favorites
if
it
werent
for
the
heavily
lingering
aftertaste
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
81
im
happy
that
my
first
review
is
of
one
of
my
favorite
beers
which
wholeheartedly
deserves
a
beer
lovers
praise
this
drink
should
be
unesco
protected
and
it
clearly
defines
the
style
original
score
was
4
50
for
a
tapped
version
i
rate
this
one
0
50
lower
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
drank
urquell
20
yrs
so
i
dont
recall
the
formula
change
that
people
have
mentioned
liked
it
back
then
like
it
now
pilsners
are
clean
straight
forward
with
balanced
hops
up
front
i
think
this
describes
urquell
well
there
may
be
better
pils
out
there
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
try
it
and
be
the
judge
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
less
than
the
crispness
i
wanted
overall
its
good
d
fresh
bitter
clean
the
way
to
go
when
faced
with
mass
beers
only
the
pilsner
overall
an
excellent
pilsner
light
enough
for
more
than
one
or
two
but
with
more
substance
than
most
pilsners
what
else
can
be
said
about
pilsner
urquell
the
original
and
still
the
best
from
the
smoothness
to
the
nutty
undertones
to
the
bitter
aftertaste
one
of
the
best
beers
available
other
pilsners
lack
the
allaround
quality
this
beer
is
a
gem
by
all
standards
deep
golden
yellowin
color
with
perfect
clarity
started
with
a
short
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
intense
bready
biscuity
malt
aroma
with
hints
if
toasted
malt
along
with
buttery
and
earthy
herbal
hop
notes
medium
bodied
with
dense
tight
emergent
carbonation
thru
the
middle
to
the
end
bready
malt
flavor
up
front
with
earthy
herbal
hop
flavors
expanding
through
the
middle
finished
cleanly
with
a
delayed
dryness
along
with
herbal
hop
and
bready
malt
aftertaste
love
the
17oz
can
huge
bready
malt
character
flavor
sweet
barley
malt
crackers
toasted
bread
a
tangy
hop
bite
in
the
middle
and
finish
overall
a
classic
and
delicious
brew
most
excellent
overall
it
is
a
very
good
light
lager
very
balanced
and
drinkable
very
refreshing
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
exactly
what
pilsener
must
taste
like
i
havent
drank
it
from
the
bottle
too
recently
but
its
not
nearly
as
good
and
i
wouldnt
bother
buying
the
bottles
anymore
maybe
its
too
tough
to
get
fresh
or
the
dreaded
green
bottles
i
dont
believe
a
pilsner
could
possibly
get
any
better
than
this
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
flavor
thats
absolutely
perfect
with
sweet
malt
and
subtle
hops
so
drinkable
at
4
4
this
will
be
a
summer
staple
for
me
overall
a
great
take
on
the
style
and
one
that
again
is
night
and
day
between
the
bottle
and
tap
versions
its
amazing
how
much
cleaner
and
more
distinct
the
flavor
profiles
are
on
the
tapped
version
versus
the
bottle
ive
seriously
opened
bottles
of
this
that
i
couldnt
finish
that
was
far
from
the
case
with
the
taste
of
it
on
tap
othe
original
pilsner
benchmark
for
all
other
pilsners
a
classic
in
its
own
respect
this
beers
has
been
enjoyed
by
me
and
many
others
o
this
is
the
standard
that
all
pilsners
are
compared
to
this
is
where
it
all
started
i
could
only
imagine
what
people
thought
when
this
was
first
invented
this
is
a
great
beer
but
i
feel
it
loses
a
bit
of
character
along
the
way
i
picked
this
bottle
up
at
my
local
shop
but
im
sure
its
been
there
for
a
while
touch
of
skunk
but
not
as
bad
as
some
heineys
ive
had
i
would
drink
more
of
this
caramel
and
saaz
and
tigers
oh
my
a
well
made
classic
pilsner
next
to
firestone
walker
pivo
pils
this
did
not
stand
up
too
well
however
a
fine
beer
to
have
when
out
overall
this
muchmaligned
beer
is
great
to
me
and
one
i
would
gladly
drink
again
not
sure
i
would
have
this
out
of
the
green
bottle
unless
i
know
its
been
properly
cared
for
but
the
can
protects
and
preserves
the
beer
preventing
skunkiness
a
refreshing
czechstyle
pilsener
which
i
would
gladly
serve
to
guests
in
a
party
environment
who
may
be
used
to
drinking
light
american
lagers
or
euro
pale
lagers
heineken
stella
etc
and
a
beer
that
would
pair
excellently
with
grilled
sausages
or
pizza
i
finally
tried
this
archetypal
czech
pilsmodern
descendent
of
a
historical
icon
at
a
calgary
pub
in
the
kensington
area
heres
another
plug
for
the
bottle
house
the
food
really
is
good
now
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
golden
amber
brew
certainly
darker
than
massproduced
euro
pale
lagers
but
with
the
same
aggressive
carbonation
and
white
head
much
has
been
said
and
written
about
this
beers
morphing
into
something
more
commercial
industrial
and
perhaps
just
plain
bland
although
some
of
these
criticisms
cannot
be
impugned
to
my
palate
this
is
still
a
pretty
solid
beer
than
is
at
least
worthy
of
riding
on
its
grandparents
coattails
the
aroma
is
fresh
bright
and
hits
the
appropriate
malt
and
hop
targets
smells
like
sweet
cornbread
and
gummy
boiled
sweet
grains
green
grassy
hops
or
hop
extract
green
fruit
and
theres
a
faint
hit
of
struck
match
or
sulfur
the
malts
are
more
complex
than
you
get
with
your
average
euro
pale
lager
evoking
popcorn
light
toast
and
even
a
faint
raisin
note
i
also
get
some
herbal
saaz
hop
character
lavender
tarragon
although
this
feature
is
disappointingly
muted
the
hops
come
off
more
as
fragrant
hay
and
do
provide
a
crisp
lingering
bitterness
not
skunked
despite
the
green
bottle
crisp
and
refreshing
if
you
want
a
hoppy
czech
pils
find
a
craftbrewed
example
i
will
say
that
this
brew
is
enjoyable
enough
and
i
appreciated
the
malt
profile
ahhhh
urquell
youve
always
been
plentiful
but
never
something
i
sought
out
regularly
because
of
your
skunkiness
i
think
however
youve
turned
a
corner
i
picked
up
a
4
pack
of
the
new
tall
format
with
the
original
art
works
from
historical
archives
not
sure
f
this
is
a
limited
thing
but
all
4
of
the
tallboys
in
this
cardboard
back
are
a
cool
retro
label
with
that
said
the
beer
however
was
the
real
stand
out
i
cant
remember
a
pilsner
urquell
tasting
this
fresh
and
frankly
malty
and
creamy
delicious
the
balance
with
the
saaz
hops
is
outstanding
in
this
pack
and
it
taste
more
like
a
munich
helles
lager
to
me
then
a
watered
down
czech
pils
that
i
remember
the
only
other
time
i
remember
urquell
tasting
this
way
was
on
tap
and
that
was
the
unfiltered
version
of
the
beer
i
think
that
the
flavor
is
probably
due
to
a
fresher
can
and
i
will
try
to
see
if
i
can
find
more
because
for
5
50
a
4
pck
of
pints
you
cant
beat
this
legendary
pils
overall
good
to
great
beer
will
be
drinking
again
4550
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
excellent
for
a
pilsner
and
good
on
a
winter
day
for
some
reason
golden
color
with
little
head
very
drinkable
for
your
average
pilsner
drinker
i
poured
this
into
my
trusty
pint
glass
i
got
for
christmas
i
dont
think
the
recognition
it
deserves
overall
text
book
stuff
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
then
expected
well
maybe
the
medium
body
was
a
bit
of
surprise
but
yes
a
well
crafted
lager
there
are
many
worse
beers
out
there
for
the
money
as
well
as
pricey
highlytouted
beers
that
are
let
downs
pilsner
urquell
is
simple
and
well
done
but
not
earth
shattering
o
i
bought
this
in
the
winter
but
would
probably
do
better
to
have
this
highly
drinkable
sessionable
beer
in
the
summer
ill
put
this
on
my
shopping
list
for
my
memorial
day
party
this
spring
i
have
a
hard
resisting
this
one
when
it
goes
on
sale
at
the
local
shop
o
ok
theyve
won
me
back
very
satisfying
for
a
4
4
brew
we
did
a
pils
tasting
on
20131221
with
this
troegs
sunshine
pils
stoudts
pils
and
victory
prima
pils
this
was
mostsimilar
to
sunshine
pils
and
about
as
good
i
like
the
prima
pils
bold
hops
flavor
a
bit
more
however
it
comes
at
the
price
of
1
more
abv
i
like
to
watch
my
calories
so
sunshine
pils
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
but
they
stop
making
it
every
year
in
august
this
pilsner
urquell
at
the
same
abv
with
as
satisfying
a
taste
will
get
me
through
the
winter
until
troegs
starts
back
up
with
sunshine
o
considering
this
beer
has
endured
a
voyage
from
the
czech
republic
to
australia
and
remains
a
fantastic
example
of
a
pilsner
is
a
testament
to
the
brewers
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
known
as
the
original
pilsner
and
for
me
it
is
the
benchmark
for
which
i
compare
all
bohemian
pilsner
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
pilsner
and
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
could
drink
this
beer
without
desire
for
anything
else
i
look
forward
to
visiting
the
plzensky
prazdroj
brewery
on
my
travels
around
the
world
as
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
fresh
from
the
source
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
is
the
first
pilsner
and
they
really
know
what
they
are
doing
i
waited
to
review
it
til
when
i
could
find
it
in
a
can
as
the
bottles
and
even
some
ive
had
ontap
have
had
that
skunkiness
imported
green
bottle
lagers
can
have
seems
that
the
people
at
pilsner
urquell
have
been
focusing
on
freshness
as
of
late
which
means
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
than
i
had
in
the
past
this
stuff
is
really
drinkable
and
i
could
probably
drink
a
gallon
of
the
stuff
this
is
really
underrated
on
this
site
as
is
many
pilsners
of
this
type
i
do
enjoy
many
of
the
american
craft
versions
of
pilsners
prima
and
scrimshaw
come
to
mind
but
really
i
think
they
are
a
bit
hopped
out
of
the
style
sometimes
in
keeping
up
with
what
craft
beer
drinkers
want
i
however
enjoy
the
grassy
medium
bitter
hops
such
as
saaz
which
really
are
showcased
in
this
beer
overall
flawless
example
of
a
czech
pilsner
the
carbonation
can
be
tasted
and
all
of
the
taste
is
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
a
good
beer
and
a
wonderful
first
try
at
a
czech
pilsner
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
persists
forever
before
washing
the
glass
in
layers
of
lace
aromas
of
sweet
bready
crackery
malt
with
a
hint
of
melanoids
a
hint
of
sweet
sulfur
and
a
firm
spicy
hop
bite
the
flavor
is
light
sweet
bready
maltiness
with
a
solid
shot
of
spicy
hop
flavor
medium
low
to
medium
level
of
hop
bitterness
lingers
at
the
end
of
each
sip
medium
body
with
a
moderately
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bubbly
carbonic
piercing
mouthfeel
very
nice
pilsner
it
took
me
a
while
but
i
can
now
really
appreciate
the
brilliance
of
this
beer
for
posterity
its
also
my
100th
beer
here
on
ba
ive
made
it
my
go
to
pilsner
oh
there
will
be
other
ones
but
urquell
is
easy
to
find
and
never
dissapoints
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
not
too
good
from
the
bottle
i
may
try
it
from
a
can
to
see
if
i
like
it
better
i
cant
see
reviewing
this
again
though
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
skunked
is
the
brewers
fault
they
choose
to
use
green
bottles
o
much
cleaner
tasting
than
in
the
us
the
taste
has
a
good
czech
malt
character
up
front
with
low
to
medium
bitterness
at
the
end
pretty
decent
i
sampled
pilz
urq
from
a
can
here
in
the
usa
3
months
out
from
the
can
printed
expiration
date
i
suspect
that
itd
be
even
better
from
a
bottle
and
way
way
better
fresh
from
a
tap
in
the
czech
republic
where
its
brewed
especially
the
unfiltered
unpasteurized
version
it
poured
a
bright
gold
with
a
substantial
white
head
while
the
skunky
aroma
and
taste
still
remain
i
can
now
recognize
the
hoppy
tones
and
sweet
malty
backbone
that
make
this
beer
so
revered
i
can
easily
see
why
this
beer
became
the
definition
of
a
style
if
you
are
looking
for
something
light
but
with
enough
bite
to
keep
your
attention
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
pilsner
urquell
the
verdict
good
beer
this
is
pretty
much
what
a
standard
noncraft
beer
should
taste
like
wellbalanced
and
crisp
everything
is
just
right
this
czech
brew
is
the
original
pils
so
i
guess
theyve
had
enough
time
to
figure
out
how
its
done
o
the
gold
standard
for
pilsners
worldwide
the
modern
rendition
is
quite
good
but
not
better
than
a
good
number
of
other
czech
lagers
and
bettered
by
several
from
inside
and
outside
the
czech
republic
including
the
unfiltered
version
of
this
beer
lower
abv
which
makes
it
nice
for
an
afternoon
but
just
wonderful
on
taste
look
smell
i
like
it
overall
a
great
pilsner
the
1st
pilsner
kudos
to
our
czech
artisan
ancestors
really
pleased
i
opened
the
bottle
and
revisited
such
a
good
old
friend
overall
what
this
beer
lacked
in
complexity
it
made
up
for
in
refined
smoothness
nice
hop
character
with
heavy
dms
a
really
well
balanced
pilsner
unlike
the
craft
pilsners
that
i
have
tried
recently
this
one
was
not
overly
hopped
it
has
a
low
abv
and
is
very
dry
and
quenching
on
a
hot
day
great
beer
to
sip
on
the
back
porch
for
a
few
hours
on
a
summer
afternoon
this
beer
imho
is
a
standard
setter
for
what
a
pilsner
should
be
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
great
it
is
truly
a
well
done
pilsner
the
hoppiness
is
ever
present
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
malty
but
clean
too
love
it
this
is
my
fifth
can
of
the
day
so
im
not
really
prepared
to
write
much
but
damn
this
beer
is
good
overall
i
have
enjoyed
this
pilsner
many
times
in
europe
and
here
in
boston
such
a
classic
and
look
forward
to
more
in
the
future
overall
pretty
good
beer
i
found
it
very
similar
in
taste
to
heineken
but
more
refined
i
guess
because
it
was
a
better
beer
i
would
have
this
one
again
pours
a
golden
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
carbonation
smells
of
a
grassy
hop
and
tastes
about
the
same
on
the
skunky
side
not
a
big
fan
of
a
lot
of
pilsners
and
this
one
is
in
that
category
was
not
impressed
with
this
one
at
all
had
higher
hopes
overall
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
just
a
damn
good
beer
o
good
brew
for
sessioning
and
on
a
hot
day
overall
anyone
with
a
real
interest
in
beer
should
become
familiar
with
this
one
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
its
everything
it
should
be
pours
clear
and
gold
with
a
big
frothy
head
and
bubbles
up
bombing
from
the
bottom
fell
off
to
splotchysoapy
lace
and
a
thin
layer
on
top
smells
like
skunk
lemon
underneath
and
pale
malts
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
honey
earthy
and
musty
with
some
pepper
in
the
back
taste
is
crisp
clean
buttered
bread
and
biscuit
good
malt
sweetness
and
finishes
with
some
earth
and
bitter
for
good
measure
its
a
touch
metallic
with
a
strong
aftertaste
classic
an
enjoyable
pilsner
somewhat
subtle
flavor
notes
overall
but
that
is
expected
from
the
style
and
these
were
well
done
in
this
one
original
pilsner
urquell
at
the
brewery
in
the
cellar
after
the
tour
i
do
not
really
like
bottled
pilsner
urquell
the
beer
there
comes
out
of
a
huge
wooden
keg
and
is
brewed
for
brewery
visitors
only
using
the
original
brewing
methods
it
is
wonderful
with
a
rich
wonderful
aroma
a
good
beer
well
made
and
simple
its
not
a
beer
that
you
need
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
and
i
think
nowadays
its
even
a
little
underrated
as
a
result
it
is
what
it
is
but
what
it
is
is
pretty
good
i
think
overal
3
55
poured
in
the
appropriate
glass
this
pilsner
shows
its
exuberant
absolutely
clear
golden
appearance
exactly
what
i
expect
from
such
style
the
aroma
and
taste
bring
grain
and
biscuit
tones
wellpaired
with
the
saaz
hops
which
brings
grassy
and
citric
notes
we
have
a
background
sweetness
alluded
by
the
lowtemperature
malting
finally
the
light
mediumcarbonated
body
leaves
us
with
a
brief
aftertaste
as
it
should
be
in
the
style
displaying
the
saaz
exuberance
it
had
been
years
since
i
had
an
urquell
in
prague
and
im
not
sure
ive
ever
had
one
stateside
i
wonder
if
this
batch
was
old
because
the
feel
and
smell
were
a
bit
skunky
in
the
end
though
it
was
a
good
reminder
of
what
an
average
pilsner
is
like
and
i
might
try
it
again
as
a
reliable
session
beer
whenever
i
just
want
to
have
a
few
over
to
drink
some
beers
during
the
summer
this
one
likely
beer
on
that
is
included
overall
a
fair
pilsner
ive
had
better
and
ive
definitely
had
worse
wouldve
scored
higher
but
the
skunk
takes
some
time
to
kill
once
it
does
the
finer
qualities
of
the
beer
are
revealed
and
it
becomes
fairly
enjoyable
o
would
definitely
drink
this
again
safe
goto
beer
not
craft
nor
stellar
but
nonetheless
satisfying
a
beautiful
folden
yellow
with
a
large
dense
fluffy
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
excellent
bright
herbal
lemony
saaz
hops
earthy
and
lemony
with
a
touch
of
buttery
softness
to
complement
the
earthy
bite
soft
pilsner
malt
is
present
doughy
and
refreshing
the
palate
opens
with
a
surprising
butteriness
more
than
i
remembered
and
more
than
im
used
to
complementing
the
doughy
bready
malt
flavors
surprisingly
earthy
herbal
and
bitter
theres
a
blend
of
lemon
and
mineral
from
the
hop
flavors
mildly
dusty
mildly
cobweblike
theres
also
a
mild
honey
flavor
drying
on
the
finish
with
the
dms
lending
a
softness
this
beer
has
lingering
earthy
bitterness
and
a
nice
snappy
hop
flavor
mediumlight
in
body
with
the
decoctedmash
mouthfeel
that
the
best
pilsners
have
this
beer
is
crisply
carbonated
and
quite
refreshing
the
dms
which
in
all
fairness
is
an
integral
part
of
the
flavor
profile
is
taking
a
little
getting
used
to
but
apart
from
that
this
beer
is
stellar
this
beer
does
pair
well
with
many
types
of
food
and
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
drink
it
on
tap
that
is
the
way
to
go
i
had
this
on
tap
in
viennaaustria
with
a
platter
of
wild
boar
and
the
flavors
mixed
quite
well
note
review
based
on
fresh
pu
on
tap
not
the
green
bottles
if
i
had
to
rate
the
bottled
version
overall
the
rating
would
be
3
9
medium
bodied
with
bright
carbonation
whisp
of
sweet
grains
turns
to
dry
hop
bitterness
bright
flavors
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
but
there
is
a
distinctive
skunk
flavor
the
new
packaging
should
prevent
this
right
herbal
and
earthy
hop
on
the
end
this
beer
tastes
like
id
enjoy
it
if
it
didnt
have
a
skunk
flavor
to
it
has
a
great
pour
and
great
color
its
the
perfect
pilsner
comes
with
a
strong
taste
of
hops
and
alcohol
that
many
beers
do
not
beat
served
between
cold
and
room
temp
even
better
on
tap
especially
if
able
to
have
in
the
czech
republic
where
its
made
you
wont
find
a
better
pilsner
around
poured
into
a
pokal
glass
pours
clear
golden
with
a
large
white
head
there
are
some
visible
bubbles
rising
in
the
glass
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
the
head
dissipates
the
aroma
is
of
grainy
and
sweet
malt
and
grassy
hops
the
flavors
follow
the
nose
theres
mildly
sweet
and
grainy
malt
balanced
by
the
grassy
noble
hop
flavors
theres
some
back
end
hop
bitterness
but
this
is
mild
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonaton
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
i
hear
this
beer
isnt
like
it
used
to
be
but
its
obviously
still
very
drinkable
id
put
it
as
average
for
the
style
though
as
ive
had
many
that
are
better
it
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
white
fluffy
head
the
head
fades
fast
but
leaves
a
thin
layer
an
top
of
the
beer
some
nice
lacing
occurs
at
this
point
it
smells
very
much
like
bread
dough
hops
also
make
a
small
appearance
the
taste
is
bready
with
a
definite
bite
from
the
hops
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
pilsner
the
hops
steal
the
finish
with
a
sharp
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
healthy
dose
of
carbonation
try
it
if
you
havent
already
pilsner
urquell
35
or
maybe
im
just
getting
sucked
into
the
ambiance
but
having
a
beer
in
or
at
least
near
its
point
of
origin
just
makes
sense
o
a
damn
shame
about
the
skunky
nose
luckily
the
rest
of
the
beer
easily
compensates
by
offering
everything
you
could
want
in
a
proper
pilsner
could
be
a
go
to
for
me
in
canson
tap
just
picked
up
a
case
of
urquell
date
on
the
bottle
was
august
2012
its
now
jan
2013
it
was
a
delightful
pick
me
up
after
drinking
u
s
macrobrews
i
poured
two
bottles
into
a
tall
aruban
balashi
22
oz
mug
to
suck
down
i
really
wanted
staropramen
after
trying
it
the
other
day
but
our
distribution
was
lacking
i
have
a
feeling
the
hippies
working
behind
the
counter
called
all
their
buddies
when
the
decent
stuff
arrives
on
tuesdays
anyways
this
is
definately
a
favorite
of
minea
bit
too
sweet
but
a
welcome
change
from
the
stuff
ive
been
indulging
i
dont
know
if
the
diacetyl
levels
are
prevalent
here
but
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
this
session
i
picked
up
a
sixer
in
cali
10
years
ago
and
dont
remember
all
the
carbonation
maybe
this
case
has
been
aged
tooo
long
it
does
have
that
apple
cider
thing
going
on
a
bit
but
still
better
than
the
yuengllings
gennys
and
lionheads
ive
been
sessioning
ill
probably
have
a
couple
more
and
then
i
will
sample
the
hofbräuhaus
münchenhopefully
this
will
be
a
bit
fresher
and
not
as
sweet
cheers
i
just
returned
from
prague
and
have
newfound
respect
for
this
beer
i
recall
long
ago
in
my
youth
i
was
told
pilsner
urquell
is
the
standard
for
the
style
however
after
trying
it
in
bottles
several
times
in
the
us
i
was
never
impressed
however
fresh
draft
pilsner
urquell
in
the
czech
republic
changed
my
opinion
of
this
beer
much
more
pronounced
although
still
subtle
hop
bitterness
fresh
noble
hop
fragrance
and
an
overall
feeling
of
understanding
of
why
this
defined
the
style
tasting
it
this
way
i
can
honestly
say
i
would
drink
this
beer
very
very
often
if
i
could
get
it
as
fresh
back
home
despite
having
this
when
it
is
cold
and
snowy
i
am
really
pleased
with
this
i
assume
the
difference
is
in
the
handling
not
skunked
not
oxidized
tastes
very
much
like
draft
urquell
i
have
avoided
the
bottled
version
in
the
past
but
if
this
is
what
it
is
now
like
i
will
be
trying
this
again
a
solid
thirstquenching
pils
the
way
the
style
should
be
sure
the
hop
aroma
has
faded
a
bit
over
the
years
but
the
fluffy
head
hasnt
the
hop
flavor
the
peppery
spiciness
isnt
quite
there
anymore
but
the
peppery
hop
flavor
is
still
food
urquell
is
still
a
bitter
lager
and
thats
why
its
still
my
favorite
czech
beer
now
dont
get
wrong
i
like
some
of
the
more
balanced
czech
pilsners
like
budvar
er
czechvar
or
staropramen
but
ive
always
appreciated
that
bitter
bite
in
a
pilsner
urquell
the
trick
is
to
find
a
retailer
that
takes
good
care
of
their
bottles
this
beer
needs
to
be
consumed
as
fresh
as
possible
those
hops
fade
fast
not
really
a
pretty
beer
the
head
always
falls
quickly
but
decent
pils
that
is
very
low
alcohol
for
those
that
have
to
get
to
work
early
in
the
morning
still
a
benchmark
beer
for
the
style
but
wouldnt
always
be
my
first
choice
o
im
really
happy
i
pulled
the
trigger
on
buying
this
i
really
debated
knowing
i
could
get
sam
adams
noble
pils
instead
but
this
turned
out
to
be
a
success
fantastic
pilsner
many
kudos
to
the
brewery
for
taking
measures
to
ensure
their
beer
is
shipped
in
optimal
conditions
it
has
paid
off
will
be
buying
this
again
a
delicious
pilsner
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
bready
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
this
is
a
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
beer
the
malt
character
is
balanced
out
nicely
by
a
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
this
is
definitely
one
to
try
and
enjoy
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
really
the
bottles
are
underwhelming
but
the
draft
version
is
quality
stuff
a
great
session
candidate
when
i
need
a
togo
beer
of
the
czech
pilsner
style
i
will
pick
this
up
even
though
other
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
have
excited
me
more
in
the
past
such
as
staropraman
i
paired
this
with
a
pretty
typical
easterneuropean
meal
consisting
of
roasted
beef
with
baked
carrots
potatoes
and
onions
and
strong
broth
the
chances
of
me
having
this
on
its
own
indeed
are
slim
it
is
supposedly
a
legendary
beer
but
just
like
guinness
i
really
wish
i
could
have
tried
it
years
ago
before
it
went
supermacro
i
have
a
pilsner
urquell
mirror
in
my
basement
so
i
feel
obligated
to
have
it
once
in
a
while
it
simply
gets
the
job
done
pair
this
with
fish
or
pizza
and
it
doesnt
get
any
better
the
original
pilsner
and
quite
a
tasty
beer
one
i
find
myself
coming
back
to
over
and
over
overall
drinkability
a
good
simple
pilsner
nicely
hoppy
gets
a
bit
better
as
it
warms
up
went
well
with
food
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
another
1
or
2
of
these
with
no
problem
and
indeed
i
kind
of
want
another
one
a
truly
worldclass
beer
overall
3
5
as
stated
before
im
novice
at
tasting
pilsners
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
is
almost
overwhelming
i
can
enjoy
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
if
this
is
true
to
taste
or
not
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
it
has
a
nice
copper
color
body
with
a
small
foamy
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
has
a
sweetness
to
it
from
the
malt
then
a
little
hop
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
has
a
nice
crisp
taste
and
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
overall
a
really
nice
and
crisp
pilsner
tradition
and
consistency
final
score
3
58
i
had
this
one
first
in
epcot
germany
this
was
what
really
got
me
into
trying
new
types
of
beer
especially
foreign
ones
always
a
favorite
when
i
can
get
it
on
tap
i
have
had
the
bottle
type
but
it
is
in
no
where
near
as
good
as
when
it
is
served
on
tap
but
that
is
sort
of
a
given
you
know
i
kinda
thought
this
express
cold
shipped
thing
was
a
bit
of
a
marketing
gimmick
and
i
suppose
it
is
but
damn
does
it
make
the
difference
i
havent
had
a
pilsner
this
refreshing
in
a
long
time
now
i
know
why
this
is
the
definition
of
what
a
pilsner
is
supposed
to
be
recommended
pilsner
urquell
the
official
pilsner
beer
it
was
darker
in
color
than
i
expected
the
american
style
pils
i
have
tried
have
been
really
yellow
this
beer
is
darker
than
golden
with
more
brown
to
it
a
medium
dark
honey
color
best
describes
the
pilsner
urquell
top
it
off
with
a
pure
white
head
that
while
thin
lasts
and
laces
well
and
add
the
extra
fine
bubbles
and
you
have
a
beautiful
beer
the
aroma
shouts
beer
and
the
flavor
ethereal
sweetness
is
surrounded
with
complex
and
layers
of
bitterness
and
bite
this
beer
is
in
a
class
all
its
own
and
can
stand
tall
against
any
style
no
wonder
the
czechs
drink
more
beer
per
capital
than
any
other
nation
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
moderate
to
low
level
of
carbonation
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
i
dont
know
why
but
i
was
just
expecting
a
bit
more
snap
and
spice
to
the
hops
considering
the
new
emphasis
on
freshness
for
this
brew
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
malt
heavy
for
the
style
but
still
enjoyable
i
question
if
anyone
in
a
blind
tasting
could
tell
the
difference
for
the
efforts
put
forth
to
ship
this
cold
and
fresher
to
the
states
o
this
is
a
good
beer
but
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
wish
this
beer
was
served
in
abundance
at
the
nys
fair
on
a
sunny
warm
day
like
today
this
is
about
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
a
beer
get
while
still
having
a
great
taste
overall
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
i
had
it
once
on
tap
and
the
colour
was
hay
golden
while
it
had
a
very
average
taste
from
the
bottle
its
like
i
am
drinking
a
totally
different
beer
which
might
be
true
you
never
know
what
a
bar
owner
serves
as
x
beer
o
well
its
good
to
get
pilsner
urquell
in
a
fresher
less
light
beaten
state
still
not
my
favorite
but
its
a
marked
improvement
prost
o
ive
read
quite
a
few
accounts
that
the
recipe
has
been
altered
over
time
and
pilsner
urquell
isnt
the
same
beer
it
once
was
but
having
not
experienced
it
some
170
years
ago
i
cant
comment
on
their
truthfulness
i
can
however
say
that
ive
experienced
standard
transportation
pilsner
urquell
vs
its
new
counterpart
express
shipped

a

of

has

i
waver
on

of
it
i
find
not
skunky
but
on
a
warm
day
grass
fairly
full
body
and
a
bit
of
texture
from
the
bubbles
making
the
beer
quite
sharp
and
crisp
on

the
body
is

the
triple
decoction
adds
a

to
the

profile
while
turning
it
a

golden

you
can
tell
the
difference
immediately
in
pils
beers
if
its
decocted
or
not
in
the
malt
presence
and
the
darker
color
it
smells
of
floral
saaz
hops
that
are
spicy
and
perfect
in
ibus
they
go
very
well
together
in
the
flavor
of
the
beer
and
the
yeast
character
is
subtle
at
best
the
triple
decoction
adds
dextrinfeel
to
the

this
one
isnt
changing

i
cant
give
the
best
review
for
this
as
it
is
the
first
pilsner
i
have
ever
had
but
ill
give
it
the
best
opinion
i
can
the
beer
has
a
very
clear
golden
apple
juice
color
and
when
poured
from
the
bottle
produces
a
thin
head
that
quickly
diminishes
the
beer
in
not
very
strong
and
the
smell
is
so
light
that
its
almost
not
detectable
altogether
this
is
a
smooth
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
thus
far
the
pilsner
is
not
my
favorite
d
overall
an
okay
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
for
a
party
nothing
special
though
and
wish
the
taste
was
a
little
less
watery
this
beer
on
the
whole
is
a
step
up
from
the
bmcs
but
not
by
much
gotta
give
it
some
props
from
being
one
of
the
original
czech
pilsners
this
pilsner
is
light
enough
to
make
an
excellent
refresher
drink
this
is
a
good
beer
the
czechs
know
pilsners
and
even
though
this
is
widely
marketed
all
over
creation
now
it
hasnt
lost
any
of
the
qualities
that
made
it
work
in
the
first
place
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
the
green
bottle
but
what
can
you
do
be
sure
to
drink
it
fresh
or
on
tap
d
quite
drinkable
got
this
on
tap
in
my
hotel
in
prague
had
a
nice
golden
color
slight
carbonation
with
about
2in
head
not
much
lacing
this
beer
was
very
forgetful
some
slight
malty
aroma
but
not
much
in
the
taste
department
i
actually
had
more
of
a
metallic
taste
than
anything
was
able
to
put
back
4
before
had
to
leave
for
dinner
but
not
impressed
at
all
here
is
a
suggestion
wthis
beer
or
any
pils
really
but
i
have
found
that
let
the
beer
come
to
close
to
celler
temp
pour
harshly
into
a
mug
not
flued
pils
glass
and
let
settle
for
a
couple
of
minutes
then
smell
and
sip
much
better
than
straaight
out
of
the
fridge
into
a
glass
try
it
and
see
if
it
is
not
better
pours
a
straw
color
with
almost
no
head
even
with
an
agresive
pour
smell
is
pretty
decent
but
not
wowed
yet
things
get
better
in
the
taste
department
its
good
but
has
an
after
taste
that
i
dont
care
for
much
good
carbonation
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
but
has
that
after
taste
if
someone
was
handing
these
out
id
drink
one
or
two
again
but
theres
better
beers
out
there
to
be
had
pours
up
clear
yellow
with
a
thick
head
some
malt
in
the
aroma
but
not
too
much
else
starts
off
clean
with
slightly
sweet
malt
flavors
finishes
with
tingle
of
hops
on
the
tongue
after
three
glasses
its
a
little
too
bitter
its
still
good
though
could
drink
three
or
four
of
these
but
too
much
flavor
after
a
while
well
if
one
would
ask
me
to
name
a
pilsner
without
a
doubt
the
first
name
that
springs
to
mind
is
the
pilsner
urquell
all
pilsners
are
originated
from
this
fine
brew
although
i
taste
some
change
oer
the
years
this
was
the
1st
pilsyou
got
your
straw
color
creamy
white
head
that
malty
hoppy
aroma
tho
i
always
thought
it
could
use
more
aroma

the

which
is

for

smell

floral
but
appealing
taste
is

and
tastes

a
pilsener

mouthfeel

are
both
great

not

i
would

that

urquell
is

a
try

everybody
even
if
you
hate
pilseners
soft
carbonation
supports
a
smooth
but
filling
body
ive
gotta
say
that
im
wonderfully
surprised
by
this
beer
ive
had
this
in
the
bottle
a
number
of
times
and
have
failed
to
enjoy
it
the
can
appears
to
have
made
all
the
difference
in
preserving
freshness
and
taste
highly
drinkable
could
be
a
good
session
beer
if
it
were
a
little
more
flavorful
this
time
i
had
this
it
came
in
a
can
with
a
freshness
date
on
the
bottom
the
pilsner
pours
a
clean
straw
color
with
a
foam
head
that
doesnt
stay
long
it
has
a
little
bit
of
aroma
to
the
nose
which
is
a
hop
spiciness
it
is
same
with
the
taste
which
has
the
same
spicy
hopness
and
a
clean
malt
flavor
this
is
a
great
beer
during
the
summer
and
in
my
opinion
a
session
beer
for
me
ive
always
heard
about
this
beer
but
never
had
it
pours
a
medium
pale
color
with
a
thin
minimal
head
the
glass
is
clean
tho
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
with
some
hops
and
a
sweetness
taste
is
clean
smooth
and
goes
down
really
well
somewhat
flavorful
but
not
too
impressive
definitely
a
very
sessionable
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
overall
i
really
enjoyed
hit
brew
something
that
i
will
get
in
the
future
i
have
to
give
urquell
high
marks
as
for
its
features
and
price
nothing
comes
close
that
is
readily
available
palate
is
crisp
clean
and
just
a
bit
sweet
on
the
finish
a
hint
of
tangy
european
hops
provides
a
bracing
edge
reminding
you
that
its
a
true
czech
pilsner
body
is
light
and
airy
just
about
perfect
for
the
pilsner
style
it
renders
the
beer
quite
drinkable
a
delightful
beer
on
a
warm
summer
night

this
one

this

a
pleasant
lingering
goldfines
claim
this
is
one
of
the
six
beers
you
will
meet
in
heavenholds
up
as
i
can
and
have
drunk
this
twelve
months
of
the
year
in
variously
different
situations
always
with
a
consistent
result
in
bottle
or
on
tap
overall
would
be
a
decent
pilsner
except
for
those
great
menories
of
the
old
days
with
urquell
the
classic
pilsner
and
the
first
of
its
kind
a
perfect
session
beer
easy
to
drink
but
plenty
of
flavor
orange
peel
flavors
stick
out
along
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
a
very
desirable
beer
especially
considering
it
can
be
had
for
7
a
6
pack
will
pick
up
a
12
pack
of
these
next
time
i
go
to
the
store
crisp
refreshing
and
fantastic
much
better
than
what
i
recall
in
a
bottle
i
admit
that
i
picked
this
beer
up
due
to
its
history
the
original
pilsner
ive
heard
that
the
recipe
has
been
modernized
but
since
i
dont
know
the
difference
i
can
see
why
the
style
quickly
spread
around
the
world
single
bottle
from
whole
foods
raleigh
theyve
got
great
rotation
so
this
is
certainly
not
skunked
drinkability
a
historic
pilsener
and
a
decent
one
at
that
with
a
low
abv
just
a
little
lacking
in
almost
every
category
an
allaround
decent
beer
although
id
prefer
a
budweiser
budvar
to
this
creation
id
have
another
urquell
if
given
the
opportunity
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
as
it
was
one
of
the
first
better
beers
i
tried
after
drinking
macrobrewed
swill
although
i
seem
to
be
mostly
into
ales
these
days
i
still
like
to
drink
this
every
so
often
good
beer
the
appearance
is
a
nice
amber
color
the
taste
is
a
nice
clean
taste
i
find
no
aftertaste
with
this
beer
as
this
is
the
original
pilsner
it
has
to
be
tried
a
little
low
in
alcohol
content
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
a
good
nights
drinking
i
would
recommend
this
beer
alone
or
with
food
nothing
too
special
but
a
fine
all
around
beer
d
excellent
session
beer
with
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
for
how
low
the
abv
is
wonderful
right
from
the
bottle
this
offering
gave
off
a
skunky
aroma
which
made
me
hesitate
a
bit
on
going
in
for
a
taste
when
finally
taking
the
plunge
the
taste
was
not
as
skunky
as
the
smell
after
a
few
sips
it
just
tasted
a
bit
like
your
average
watered
down
pilsner
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
so
its
possible
this
could
have
been
a
bad
batch
but
from
this
one
offering
i
was
less
than
pleased
drinkability
is
much
better
than
average
due
to
the
relatively
common
skunky
issue
cans
are
recommended
for
this
beer
imo
better
from
the
can
vs
the
bottle
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
pilsner
urquell
was
golden
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
large
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
noticeable
with
floral
earthy
and
somewhat
spicy
hops
with
a
little
grain
the
taste
was
more
hops
than
malt
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
dry
finish
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
was
a
good
pilsner
and
definitely
worth
a
try
just
be
sure
to
get
a
fresh
bottle
very
tasty
light
flavored
beer
almost
a
floral
flavour
but
also
grainy
fairly
hoppy
but
not
bad
at
all
nice
color
sort
of
a
medium
amber
i
guess
i
find
that
its
served
best
cold
and
as
others
have
said
probably
a
great
bbq
drink
thats
how
i
had
mine
it
strikes
me
as
a
bit
odd
to
be
reviewing
this
for
the
first
time
now
as
i
have
had
soo
many
of
these
in
the
past
but
in
reality
i
had
not
had
one
in
a
good
couple
years
so
i
felt
it
was
time
to
pick
one
up
and
have
it
so
i
could
put
it
in
a
review
poured
a
deep
amber
to
golden
amber
with
a
huge
billwing
white
head
that
qucikly
receded
down
to
nothing
simply
leaving
a
ring
of
lace
surrounding
the
sides
of
the
glass
no
residual
lace
was
present
and
the
carbonation
was
decent
as
it
bubbled
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
pretty
average
your
typical
musty
earthy
grain
aroma
with
a
touch
of
some
european
bittering
hops
but
just
barely
a
touch
the
taste
was
pretty
self
descript
musty
grain
and
bread
a
little
cereal
like
but
that
was
about
it
nice
smooth
slick
feel
not
as
much
carbonation
when
drinking
as
the
appearence
would
have
let
on
very
drinkable
when
very
cold
but
like
alot
of
pilsners
they
tend
to
not
warm
so
well
in
my
opion
overall
this
was
enjoyable
as
always
as
a
session
beer
it
is
a
good
one
to
stock
the
cooler
with
for
the
bbq
always
a
treat
of
course
there
are
better
but
this
is
the
original
try
if
you
have
not
you
kinda
have
to
this
is
a
very
good
pilsner
its
simply
delicious
i
think
it
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
pilsner
beers
it
represents
everything
that
a
true
pilsner
should
be
i
poured
the
green
bottle
of
beer
into
a
frozen
frosty
pint
glass
and
drank
the
beer
slowly
as
i
watched
an
afternoon
tiger
game
i
enjoyed
several
more
before
the
wife
got
home
from
work
the
taste
was
smooth
there
was
no
crappy
bitter
aftertaste
it
wasnt
too
damn
hoppy
it
just
tasted
great
i
wanted
this
situation
to
last
forever
but
then
the
tigers
beat
the
twins
and
then
the
wife
came
home
my
brother
really
likes
this
so
i
tried
this
again
recently
must
admit
i
am
usually
more
of
an
ale
guy
poured
rich
golden
color
with
head
that
dissipated
quickly
not
bad
but
no
overwhelming
characteristic
that
would
make
me
seek
it
out
kind
of
a
low
alcohol
content
slight
hint
of
skunk
in
the
aroma
why
do
they
insist
on
green
bottles
amount
of
carbonation
is
just
right
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
very
sessionable
flavor
seems
to
get
less
hoppy
every
time
i
have
it
this
one
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
doesnt
hold
long
the
smell
is
loaded
with
bitter
noncitrusy
hops
and
grain
but
unfortunately
has
a
mildly
skunky
background
again
lots
of
bitter
herbal
hops
in
the
taste
with
a
finish
that
is
both
mildly
sweet
and
has
a
mineral
quality
there
are
better
pilsners
but
this
is
a
solid
mainstream
brew
12
oz
bottle
pours
clear
golden
yellow
hew
smells
strongly
of
stale
hops
the
head
appeared
for
a
short
period
little
over
1
cm
of
white
head
initial
flavor
is
mildly
bitter
by
the
finish
it
is
well
balanced
by
a
mild
sweetness
light
body
with
mild
carbonation
flavor
lingers
a
bit
but
is
enjoyable
something
different
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
perfect
for
hot
thirsty
weather
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
has
the
aroma
of
a
european
hop
and
a
mixture
of
sweetness
and
a
tad
skunky
it
feels
a
bit
watered
down
for
a
pils
a
very
small
hop
presence
it
is
refreshing
a
nice
dry
end
and
very
clean
always
nice
for
the
summer
d
very
good
its
a
quality
pilsner
so
its
going
to
be
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
dry
hops
would
also
be
a
good
reset
button
for
a
variety
of
foods
overall
it
is
a
nice
pilsener
complex
and
interesting
i
was
particularly
not
impressed
by
its
poor
retention
and
its
almost
puckery
aftertaste
might
have
this
one
again
pours
clear
and
bright
with
the
color
of
dirty
gold
nice
thick
head
and
constant
upward
bubbles
gritty
aroma
of
saaz
and
sulphur
with
a
bit
of
bready
lightly
malted
grains
thrown
in
zesty
and
enticing
on
the
palate
more
doughy
notes
come
first
mixed
with
brisk
bitterness
and
precise
carbonation
before
a
slightly
sweet
taste
surfaces
before
finishing
dry
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
perfect
light
but
not
watery
with
carbonation
that
provides
just
the
right
amount
of
bite
and
those
wonderful
saaz
hop
oils
overall
this
is
a
stellar
beer
maybe
its
not
what
it
used
to
be
i
dont
know
but
its
an
excellent
pilsner
regardless
d
nice
light
and
refreshing
pilsner
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
particularly
given
the
low
alcohol
presence
nothing
too
complex
or
exciting
but
noticeably
better
than
most
domestic
pilsners
i
had
this
from
a
bottle
at
a
specialty
bar
in
toronto
this
was
poured
by
the
waiter
and
was
a
nice
crystal
golden
colour
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
slightly
yeasty
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
as
was
the
flavour
a
little
carbonation
to
tickle
the
tongue
always
helps
i
would
definitely
try
this
beer
again
d
an
average
beer
but
compared
to
other
pilsners
its
probably
a
bit
above
average
not
bad
at
all
but
on
the
other
hand
not
that
exciting
overall
its
a
good
beer
nothing
to
get
excited
about
and
in
its
price
range
and
style
there
are
better
options
to
be
had
having
said
that
its
still
a
decent
beer
less
than
impressive
head
sits
atop
a
slightly
darker
than
expected
golden
body
with
lovely
champagne
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
smell
is
crisp
with
a
notable
presence
of
saaz
as
for
the
flavor
this
is
far
from
the
most
complex
beer
ive
ever
tasted
but
more
complex
than
i
expected
with
a
touch
of
smokiness
in
the
malt
which
is
a
brilliant
compliment
to
the
noble
hop
mouth
is
entertained
nay
delighted
and
then
it
vanishes
ive
seldom
had
a
cleaner
finishing
beer
that
left
me
wanting
more
more
yes
i
meant
to
say
more
more
than
this
turn
of
events
dgood
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
pretty
avergae
for
a
czech
pilseneri
used
to
live
there
this
is
definitely
better
overseas
and
i
think
it
probably
used
to
be
a
better
overall
beer
before
the
take
over
not
a
terrible
option
but
not
fantastic
either
drinkability
the
low
abv
combined
with
the
fact
that
this
is
a
little
watery
makes
this
extremely
drinkable
almost
by
default
its
readily
available
and
should
do
the
trick
as
an
enjoyable
session
beer
should
obviously
better
options
be
lacking
tastewise
this
would
be
a
nice
pilsner
if
it
didnt
have
the
skunk
otherwise
its
quite
decent
yet
unspectacular
one
of
the
more
popular
and
accessable
czech
beers
in
the
us
but
theres
others
that
are
much
better
and
in
my
experience
dont
get
skunked
as
often
pilsner
urquell
definitely
tastes
a
little
sharper
and
hoppier
in
the
czech
republic
than
it
does
at
home
however
the
beer
is
golden
clear
no
lacing
a
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
is
sharp
lemony
a
bit
skunky
not
all
that
enticing
the
taste
well
it
is
sharp
when
the
beer
is
cold
but
as
it
warms
the
sweetness
on
the
palate
emerges
and
you
have
warm
lemony
citrus
tones
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
a
refreshing
beer
very
clean
the
carbonation
is
just
right
you
cant
go
wrong
here
lchaim
overall
pilsner
urquell
is
a
great
tasting
beer
but
like
many
of
the
european
pils
and
lagers
it
looks
your
mouth
thirsty
for
more
to
me
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
jeezz
i
usually
dont
like
pilsners
but
this
was
quite
flavorful
and
tasty
the
pilsner
you
judge
all
others
too
i
bet
i
read
recently
that
this
beer
and
pilsners
in
general
became
popular
when
europeans
began
to
switch
from
drinking
out
of
clay
and
earthen
mugs
to
glass
because
the
color
and
clearness
of
beer
became
suddenly
important
something
we
all
take
for
granted
now
of
course
but
interesting
to
think
about
overall
this
was
pretty
good
but
i
like
the
czech
budweiser
budvar
better
another
great
pilsner
and
one
of
the
only
good
beers
that
has
flavor
and
a
large
marketing
campaign
go
figure
theres
a
sour
bready
aroma
and
bitter
light
malt
flavor
that
has
a
tinge
of
grainy
sweetness
what
would
make
this
beer
better
is
more
hops
flavor
the
bitterness
is
good
but
the
flavor
isnt
quite
there
still
a
good
drinking
beer
i
ordered
a
second
d
very
easy
to
drink
an
unbelievably
light
fresh
and
wellbalanced
sessionable
lager
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
failed
to
see
alot
of
its
merits
likely
due
to
the
skunking
problems
with
the
green
bottles
given
the
improved
packaging
and
a
more
refined
less
dismissive
palette
this
one
is
really
impressing
me
definitely
glad
i
gave
it
another
try
will
come
back
to
this
in
the
future
the
lightness
and
balance
make
it
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
overall
this
beer
is
okay
i
think
if
it
were
in
a
brown
bottle
or
a
can
it
would
be
much
better
this
brew
is
crisp
and
refreshing
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
at
a
bbq
or
a
baseball
game
on
a
july
afternoon
poured
a
bottle
of
this
into
a
glass
mug
it
poured
a
dark
gold
body
but
no
head
was
present
and
there
was
minimal
lacing
the
smell
was
malty
adn
sweet
something
i
did
not
really
expect
and
kind
had
me
wondering
what
my
taste
buds
were
about
to
encounter
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
but
nothing
to
impressive
pretty
solid
malts
but
there
was
a
sweet
after
taste
more
like
sugar
than
like
honey
which
is
what
i
usually
associate
with
czech
pilsners
that
did
not
really
ring
true
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
even
for
a
pilsner
can
you
drink
this
stuff
definitely
and
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
too
the
low
abv
the
thin
mouthfeel
and
the
sweet
aftertaste
make
it
overall
easy
to
drink
reminds
me
more
of
something
id
be
drinking
during
the
summer
than
all
year
round
since
it
was
so
light
overall
this
will
always
be
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
lots
of
flavor
and
excellent
drinkability
make
pilsner
urquell
an
excellent
choice
anytime
of
the
year
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
severely
lacking
in
both
malt
and
hop
flavors
furthermore
its
overwhelming
bitterness
was
at
times
difficult
to
handle
ok
so
after
all
the
hype
im
ready
to
try
the
beer
its
served
with
very
little
head
and
in
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
goldenred
and
it
has
some
effervesence
i
dont
detect
much
of
a
smell
at
all
theres
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
now
for
the
taste
yeasty
and
not
really
complex
its
got
more
flavor
than
some
more
common
pilsners
but
im
not
that
excited
about
it
maybe
some
weak
fruits
are
roaming
around
there
but
its
mostly
the
taste
of
yeast
very
refreshing
though
nice
and
easy
on
the
tongue
and
of
course
i
could
drink
this
pilsner
all
day
long
good
pilz
thats
available
everywhere
because
its
distributed
by
miller
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilseners
but
id
heard
to
much
about
this
one
that
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
light
yellowgolden
nice
head
pretty
nice
looking
nose
is
solid
surprisinginly
strong
hops
and
sweet
malt
come
through
taste
is
smooth
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
especially
for
a
pilsener
some
spices
as
well
feel
is
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
overall
a
every
tasty
and
extremely
refreshing
beer
if
i
were
feeling
like
a
lager
which
occasionally
i
am
id
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
the
cans
are
pretty
good
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
the
quintessential
example
and
i
dont
imagine
you
could
do
much
better
than
this
id
be
interested
to
try
it
on
tap
since
those
green
glass
bottles
might
be
making
for
a
lot
of
lightstruck
beer
this
is
the
pilsner
beer
no
other
or
almost
no
other
beer
should
be
called
that
great
deep
golden
colour
with
orange
reflection
when
you
put
it
to
the
light
nice
head
with
lot
of
bubbles
though
it
fades
quickly
but
leaving
a
great
lace
hoppy
aroma
of
herbs
and
hay
with
a
delicate
spicy
touch
and
even
some
fruity
hints
in
mouth
is
round
perfectly
clean
bitter
probably
the
most
bitter
pilsner
ive
ever
had
but
with
a
delicate
and
silky
flavor
and
smoked
notes
malt
is
more
noticed
than
in
the
smell
dry
finish
very
refreshing
and
appetizer
perfect
very
good
drinkable
beer
if
and
when
you
can
be
sure
its
fresh
out
of
the
tap
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
even
if
you
arent
at
the
brewery
i
think
you
can
do
better
when
buying
bottles
though
the
beer
blurs
the
line
between
dark
golden
and
light
brown
hues
and
smells
of
grassy
hops
and
a
ton
of
toasted
malts
in
the
mouth
theres
a
heavy
emphasis
on
toasted
caramel
and
nutty
malts
a
nice
contrast
to
the
standard
german
counterpart
these
dark
toasted
flavors
are
supported
by
grassy
hops
that
give
the
flavors
of
lawn
clippings
and
lemon
peels
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
crisply
carbonated
finishes
surprisingly
quickly
for
the
amount
of
flavor
i
could
drink
this
all
day
really
good
and
refreshing
and
would
be
a
good
beer
for
anyone
who
wants
to
break
into
the
craft
beer
scene
without
drinking
a
beer
thats
to
craft
i
liked
it
alot
and
would
have
again
on
tap
this
time
on
tap
its
hard
to
beat
but
on
tap
its
not
particularly
worth
it
considering
that
most
czech
pilseners
are
good
and
this
is
quite
a
bit
pricier
than
its
smaller
bretheren
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
youve
not
had
the
joy
of
the
czech
pilsener
but
the
sampling
would
be
ideally
made
in
the
czech
republic
itself
where
the
beer
is
fresh
the
people
are
friendly
and
life
is
good
what
youve
heard
and
surely
more
but
try
some
other
brands
if
youre
in
country
to
support
smaller
brewers
have
fun
the
taste
was
a
great
balance
between
bitter
hops
and
a
sweet
malty
flavour
that
was
almost
honeylike
dry
crisp
finish
but
the
carbonation
seemed
a
bit
flat
and
could
have
been
better
still
a
great
beer
and
a
highly
drinkable
one
for
all
occasions
definitely
rather
high
on
my
drinkability
list
im
not
familiar
with
the
old
style
but
i
think
i
will
continue
to
buy
this
beer
occasionally
easy
to
swig
these
babies
all
day
long
finally
got
around
to
trying
the
original
pilsner
12
oz
nonlightstruck
green
bottle
with
some
code
on
the
back
it
pours
into
my
pils
glass
a
crystalclear
pale
gold
with
a
light
bead
leading
up
to
an
inch
of
white
head
which
leaves
decent
lacing
skunkyspicy
and
greenearthy
saaz
in
the
nose
with
hints
of
grassiness
and
some
toasted
malts
its
fairly
bitter
on
the
palate
with
spicy
earthy
and
piney
hops
balanced
by
a
light
dose
of
toasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
light
to
medium
quite
drying
with
creamy
carbonation
and
medium
finish
and
it
is
immensely
drinkable
after
finishing
this
sixpack
i
immediately
went
out
and
bought
at
12
pack
which
also
went
quite
quickly
delicious
and
wellworth
a
try
p
s
only
buy
this
in
an
enclosed
twelve
pack
or
some
other
way
where
the
beer
has
not
been
exposed
to
direct
light
i
have
purchased
two
twelve
packs
in
the
past
that
have
been
skunked
freshness
is
critical
for
this
beer
and
the
green
bottle
is
a
huge
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
maker
pilsner
shootout
light
straw
in
color
with
a
quickly
disapating
head
the
skunk
at
first
smell
but
mellowed
out
to
sweet
malt
and
saaz
a
crisp
taste
malty
sweetness
spice
with
bitterness
light
clean
mouthfeel
a
definate
drinker
if
i
were
feeling
light
on
occasion
thought
this
was
a
very
good
pilsner
compared
to
others
ive
had
the
saaz
hop
character
was
a
bit
more
mild
and
a
combination
of
sweeter
malt
and
less
harsh
carbination
made
this
much
more
pleasant
to
drink
the
combination
of
less
bitter
taste
and
smooth
mouthfeel
was
excellent
making
this
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
pilsner
it
worked
nicely
with
the
sushi
and
wasabi
light
bodied
malt
grassy
biscuit
with
mild
nut
caramel
fruit
and
a
hint
of
roast
splash
of
fruityfloral
hop
character
provides
refreshing
balance
and
significant
bitterness
decent
carbonation
throughout
finishes
with
a
nice
bitter
toffee
coating
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
im
going
to
search
out
but
ill
happily
order
it
in
a
restaurant
where
the
only
other
options
are
bmc
and
guinness
or
stella
drinkability
high
especially
considering
this
beers
simplicity
and
lightness
final
statement
very
much
like
standard
euro
lagers
yet
the
best
of
the
bunch
if
youre
into
heiniken
or
stella
on
warm
summer
nights
then
try
out
pilsner
urquell
ill
continue
to
you
buy
this
every
so
often
for
that
particular
event
used
a
pilsner
glass
to
try
this
the
first
pilsner
ever
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
large
bead
rising
from
bottom
looks
like
most
people
think
of
beer
in
a
pils
glass
sweat
on
the
glass
steady
carbo
nice
small
head
looks
like
a
classic
example
of
beer
the
first
smell
was
kinda
skunky
which
is
possible
with
the
green
glass
also
a
sourish
hoppy
smell
and
some
veggie
smell
of
mostly
corn
taste
was
about
the
same
with
the
biggest
contributor
being
the
hops
and
adjuncts
mouthfeel
on
lighter
side
with
carbonation
bubbles
fading
fast
light
drying
aftertaste
fairly
crisp
finish
drinkability
was
ok
at
best
but
had
to
try
the
original
pilsner
at
least
once
pours
out
a
bright
gold
with
a
soft
head
that
leaves
lacing
all
around

then
leads

and
slightly
bitter

is
of

and
the
carbonation
is
sufficient
perfect
drinkability
a
clean
hoppy
lager
but
didnt
sense
the
malt
backbone
that
i
know
this
beer
usually
has
the
lack
of
body
and
balance
provided
by
this
malt
hurt
the
drinkability
for
me
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
deep
hue
of
gold
with
moderate
carbonation
the
head
is
very
shortlived
then
settles
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
that
of
skunky
hops
and
sweet
corn
like
hints
the
taste
is
rather
full
and
bold
with
sweet
almost
chocolaty
malts
up
front
followed
by
a
bittersweet
hoppy
ending
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
thick
and
full
for
a
pilsner
and
has
a
creamy
texture
the
citrusy
hops
create
a
crisp
bite
towards
the
end
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
with

a
12
pack
d
excellent
this
in
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
and
it
pairs
extremely
well
with
spicy
chicken
wings
imo
this
is
ten
times
better
on
tap
than
from
a
bottle
poured
deep
gold
with
a
oneinch
head
that
dropped
to
a
film
quickly
an
initial
powerful
smell
of
skunk
why
the
green
bottle
why
that
faded
into
the
background
but
did
not
totally
vanish
aroma
of
sazz
with
undertones
of
caramel
taste
is
surprisingly
bitter
but
balanced
nicely
with
malt
especially
when
the
beer
warms
up
a
little
overall
i
was
extremely
surprised
that
this
green
bottle
stuff
wasnt
skunked
my
advice
screw
the
sixpack
and
get
it
by
the
12
pack
completely
encased
in
cardboard
and
shielded
away
from
the
mean
ol
beer
skunkin
light
pours
a
beautiful
light
gold
the
head
is
nice
but
fizzy
and
dissapates
rather
quicky
that
traditional
euro
pils
skunkiness
is
there
and
at
the
end
it
really
explodes
with
a
crisp
grassy
and
slighty
overdone
hop
bite
this
isnt
bad
but
its
definately
more
bitter
than
most
it
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
at
least
for
me
distinctive
and
thirst
quenching
but
will
be
too
bitter
for
most
palates
love
the
color
love
the
bottles
tasteaverage
has
the
typical
metallicsulfur
aroma
starts
smooth
with
a
dry
feel
and
overly
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
not
to
shabby
for
an
original
pilsner
but
i
will
try
some
other
brands
as
well
a
good
round
by
pilsner
urquell
puts
it
past
stella
artois
in
the
early
standings
will
its
score
stand
up
for
the
rest
of
the
meet
stay
tuned
this
honestly
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
light
beer
theres
a
bitterness
to
it
not
uncommon
with
the
style
and
a
clean
finish
its
not
complex
but
it
doesnt
try
to
be
a
good
session
beer
and
perfect
for
say
tailgating
a
hockey
game
which
is
what
i
used
it
for
last
night
pours
a
fairly
light
yellow
with
a
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
grainy
grassy
notes
and
spicy
hops
come
through
as
well
classic
pilsner
just
a
touch
of
light
fruits
and
citrus
as
well
taste
seems
lackluster
at
first
but
improves
drastically
as
the
beer
warms
the
hops
really
start
to
shine
as
it
reaches
about
14c
herbal
with
just
a
hint
of
lemon
and
grapefruit
the
malts
are
a
bit
thin
and
dont
provide
as
much
support
as
they
could
but
they
arent
offensive
either
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
plenty
of
carbonation
but
still
full
enough
to
allow
the
hops
to
linger
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
excellent
the
classic
pils
its
got
its
faults
but
is
a
musttry
for
everyone
at
some
point

nice

beer
very
easy

definitely
buy
it
its
on
my
list
note
this
beer
comes
in
those
wretched
green
bottles
which
allow
light
in
you
will
often
get
a
skunky
one
with
this
beer
if
you
can
find
it
on
tap
drink
it
otherwise
you
are
taking
your
chances
i
got
lucky
with
this
one

i
know
its
the
original
and
its
true
to
style
light
and
straw
color
foamy

with
a
floral

the
taste
is
hoppy
with
pleasant

background
but
in
the
end
the
hops
win
out
quite
drinkable
and
low

lend
to
that
a

a
good
choice
for

lovers
perfect
golden

in

nice

head
which
disappears
quickly
with
little

the
smell
is
pretty
typical
of
the
style
little
malt
and
fresh
hops
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
with
a
hop
presence
that
can
only
be
discribed
by
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
theres
a
slight
lemon
aftertaste
any
mouthfeel
left
by
this
beer
is
fleeting
d
mouthfeel
really
helps
the
drinkability
only
if
it
had
a
little
more
bite
then
this
beer
would
go
from
good
to
great
a

sierra

then
this
is
not
true
to
the
style
except
urquell
is
supposed
to
be
the
origional
pilsner
so
my
conclusion
is
that
pilsner
in
general
is
overhyped
just
because
its
got
an
interesting
color
and
a
new
hop
doesnt
make
it
the
class
of
the
world

beer
that

go
through

with
out
at
least
trying
once
a
great
example
of
style
in
fact
the
first
of
its
style
quote
from
my
fiancee
does
crappy
have
one
or
2
ps
that
says
it
all
i
think
i
had
a
bottle
that
was
exposed
to
the
light
too
long
because
the
skunk
smell
was
literally
unbearable
whatever
positives
in
the
flavor
were
drowned
out
by
the
horrid
stench
i
will
have
to
try
this
one
again
sometime
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
like
others
have
said
the
standard
that
pilsners
should
be
compared
to
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
very
little
head
depending
on
how
long
it
took
to
get
to
our
table
the
aroma
was
quite
hoppy
with
hints
of
malt
this
was
how
the
initial
flavor
was
also
but
as
the
beer
warmed
a
little
the
maltiness
came
through
a
little
more
carbonation
gave
a
full
mouthfeel
very
good
and
worth
many
more
repeat
samplings
still
a
good
beer
this
one
may
have
gotten
a
little
warm
and
then
cold
again
so
i
am
not
sure
if
it
was
in
good
shape
however
i
remember
the
first
time
i
had
it
and
it
was
pretty
good
not
too
carbonated
with
a
little
malty
flavoring
my
most
recent
sampling
was
more
bitter
than
i
remembered
it
to
be
but
then
again
it
may
have
been
a
little
skunked
overall
i
would
say
this
is
an
enjoyable
quality
pils
this
is
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
it
also
had
a
lot
to
due
with
me
beginning
to
appreciate
truly
great
beers
i
first
had
this
beer
while
on
a
trip
to
the
czech
republic
upon
returning
it
didnt
quite
match
my
memory
but
now
that
i
know
more
about
beer
that
was
probably
due
to
the
importing
process
it
still
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
clear
golden
color
and
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
get
my
mouth
watering
it
definately
sets
the
standard
for
pilsners
hoppy
at
the
front
and
developing
to
a
very
refreshing
finish
i
have
read
some
comments
on
pilsner
urquell
diminishing
in
quality
and
i
myself
did
mention
finding
it
a
little
more
special
nearer
to
its
home
but
this
is
still
a
fantastic
brew
nicer
golden
colour
than
i
remember
with
a
foamy
head
that
quickly
turns
into
a
light
lace
i
am
not
impressed
with
the
sulphery
smell
kind
of
a
turn
off
however
the
brew
tastes
much
better
than
the
stink
the
medium
body
has
a
slight
pleasant
bitingedge
and
tastes
a
bit
sweet
with
a
strong
but
unobtrusive
hoppiness
the
beer
drinks
great
with
a
solid
tastey
aftertaste
this
beer
can
stand
alone
or
with
any
foods
a
really
strong
beer
after
all
it
is
the
pislner
urquell
but
the
smell
drags
my
review
down
regardless
enjoy
cheers
a
very
very
good
beer
some
people
claim
of
skunk
and
while
i
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
sample
this
beer
directly
from
the
czech
republic
on
one
ocassion
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
light
clean
and
very
refreshing
with
a
soft
and
lacy
head
this
is
by

one
of
the
most
drinkable
brews
of

origin
bottoms
up
this
one
is

it
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
now
i
only
have
it
if
there
is
not
much
else
around
problem
is
the
green
bottle
i
have
had
so
many
skunk
ones
if
you
get
a
good
one
it
is
a
great
pilsner
much
more
bitter
than
the
usual
can
have

that

the

this
is

pilsener
on

ill
agree
with
others
that
its
spotty
in

bottle
the
color
and
head
are
typical
for
a
pilsener

the

and

set
it

the

at

a

aroma
follows

for

hop
bitterness
is
fairly

to
the
soft

backbone
and
light
sweetness
hop
flavor
is
a
touch
grassy
but
not
overbearingly
so
and
adds
to
the
complexity
of
this
pilsner
although

i
recently
tried
this
at
a
party
it
is
a
fairly
light
beer
with
a
slight
skunky
smell
to
it
i
found
it
to
not
be
the
most
drinkable
pilsner
i
have
had
nice
yellowgold
color
i
had
such
a
bad
impression
of
pilsners
due
to
their
american
mass
produced
counterparts
that
i
thought
i
was
not
going
to
like
this
but
it
pleasantly
surprised
me
nice
citrus
flavors
and
aromas
good
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
finish
make
for
very
easily

beer

with

overtones
quite
smooth

slightly
sweet
finish
i
was
a
little
dissappointed
in
comparison
to
its
top
rated
status
im
not
too
big
on
pilsners
but
this
is
drinkable
the
colors
nice
although
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
for
such
an
otherwise
light
flavor
more
flavor
than
a
stella
artois
though
as
i
struggle
with
the
allure
of
slamming
ab
again
i
must
admit
this
is
not
the
best
pils
ive
ever
had
that
being
said
if
i
lived
in
a
pilsener
only
world
this
would
be
on
my
top
five
list
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
this
might
be
fresh
in
the
czech
republic
the
original
very
crisp
with
an
agreeable
golden
color
bubbly
body
and
a
sharp
wellenunciated
hop
taste
one
of
the
most
drinkable
of
beers
a
taste
i
crave
a
few
times
of
the
year
very
very
good
pils
great
floral
hop
nose
pungent
taste
and
well
rounded
hop
bitterness
i
just
wish
they
didnt
use
green
bottles
coz
it
skunks
easily
from
what
my
pop
told
me
i
searched
searched
again
for
this
great
powerful
taste
like
the
past
reviews
said
they
must
have
changed
the
the
way
they
brew
this
stuff
bottom
line
is
its
a
little
above
average
to
me
but
overall
a
drinkable
beer
as
they
say
its
the
original
pilsner
worthy
of
a
shot
prosit
well
this
was
a
much
more
complex
brew
some
years
back
anyone
remember
when
it
came
in
brown
bottles
4
packs
when
they
were
still
lagering
in
wood
vessels
now
that
they
have
switched
to
stainless
steel
tanks
something
has
been
lost

this
is
your
beer

lover
should
take
a

to
plzen

walk

not

although
the

at

all

good
shiner
offering
my
favorite
from
this
brewer
to
date
light
crisp
beer
has
a
good
taste
hops
were
noticeable
but
not
very
strong
taste
was
good
and
had
character
compared
to
other
shiner
offerings
nice
light
offering
and
would
definitely
order
again
crystal
clear
golden
in
color
minimal

dissapating
quickly
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
very
light
with
malt
toast
and
a
touch
of
citrus
coming
through
taste
is
very
light
with
bready
and
earthiness
being
the
dominant
flavors
carbonation
is
nice
and
mouthfeel
is
good
this
beer
being
a
pilsner
is
still
lacking
the
flavor
and
balance
that
i
would
have
expected
o
not
a
great
example
of
a
czech
style
pilsner
but
its
ok
i
wouldnt
get
this
again

small
lining

around

into
a
14

a
translucent
straw
color
with
a
good
size
head
but
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
a
nice
sweet

profile
not
that
atypical
of
pilsner
but
stronger
than
many
adjuncts
tastes
of
sweet
grain
nice
profile
beer
is
light
bodied
very
drinkable
carbonated
correctly
overall
an
above
average
beer
overall
a
pretty
decent
pils
o
its
alright
the
weak
flavor
holds
it
back
more
than
anything
to
be
fair
though
i
like
my
czech
pilsners
hopped
to
fuck
and
back
so
i
cant
hold
it
against
this
brew
too
much
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
if
it
appeared
in
a
6pack
though
its
got
a
nice
warm
light
amber
color
but
no
lasting
head
and
very
little
lacing
malty
yeasty
nose
with
very
little
hint
of
hops
the
malty
sweetness
is
prominent
on
the
tongue
there
is
some
mild
citrus
hop
notes
but
the
hop
bitterness
is
almost
entirely
in
the
finish
more
than
fine
for
the
nonhopheads
among
us
not
especially
carbonated
either
but
sessionable
and
highly
drinkable
mildly
recommended
although
for
the
price
i
think
id
grab
the
more
hopforward
noble
pils
from
sam
adams
or
the
summer
pils
from
one
of
texas
other
great
breweries
st
arnolds
malty
and
quite
dry
pils
dark
malts
some
light
smoke
and
rye
notes
dry
through
the
finish
decent
not
the
most
flavorful
pils
but
no
off
flavors
again
easy
drinking
brew
overall
good
beer
overall
for
a
pilsner
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
one
of
the
hoppier
pils
ive
had
worth
a
try
well
made
czech
pilsner
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
great
simple
beer
if
it
were
more
readily
available
in
my
area
i
would
gladly
replace
this
with
any
of
your
typical
lagers
or
pilsners
recommended
i
tasted
a
slight
fruit
with
a
good
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
yeast
residue
it
is
a
fairly
light
beer
it
is
a
great
beer
for
a
good
hot
summer
lawn
mowing
day
not
bad
for
football
season
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
halfinch
head
and
lasting
lace
its
aroma
is
citrusy
with
hints
of
bread
and
hops
the
flavor
has
notes
of
lemon
and
dough
with
some
vanilla
in
the
background
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
that
fades
quickly
this
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
is
very
sessionable
and
refreshing
spoetzl
shiner
101
czech
style
pilsner
is
a
good
beer
recommended
overall
i
really
like
pilsner
beers
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
others
ive
had
like
urquell
but
a
nice
tasty
beer
only
available
for
a
little
longer
as
spoetzel
should
have
the
shiner
102
out
any
day
but
if
i
find
more
i
would
buy
again
one
day
id
love
to
sneak
a
good
pilsener
into
an
american
adjunct
drinking
friends
glass
when
they
ask
for
a
pint
fill
of
fizz
just
to
rattle
the
cage
a
bit
and
see
what
happens
perhaps
id
use
a
shiner
101
for
the
experiment
into
a
brandy
glass
this
reveals
a
clear
and
yellow
golden
color
under
a
blotchy
thin
head
with
a
good
lacing
aroma
is
a
light
but
bright
one
with
the
classic
pilsener
malt
nose
and
those
sharp
metallic
and
hop
notes
a
sweet
and
bright
generously
bodied
malt
feel
quenches
over
the
palate
with
an
equally
crisp
and
refreshing
finish
it
truly
is
simple
and
refined
as
the
brewer
states
a
simple
and
refined
display
of
saaz
hops
prosit
average
pils
d
easy
drinker
not
quite
a
czech
pilsner
but
a
good
everyday
beer
beter
than
most
lawnmower
or
bbq
beers
shiner
just
got
done
kicking
your
ass
on
another
beer
but
this
one
i
like
101
bock
and
black
should
be
your
main
focus
this
is
good
like
bud
should
be
simple
beer
nice
and
cold
good
flavor
tastes
like
beer
not
watery
now
stop
trickin
up
your
line
up
and
concentrate
on
getting
more
hops
and
flavor
into
your
main
stays
drinkability
very
drinkable
easy
going
down
and
not
too
bad
on
the
budget
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
interesting
its
slightly
heavier
bodied
than
most
pilsners
of
the
type
and
its
also
very
dry
it
works
though
its
also
very
drinkable
all
in
all
im
glad
i
took
a
shot
on
the
shiner
101
this
is
the
first
beer
of
theirs
ive
had
and
it
makes
me
want
to
try
more
theres
nothing
wrong
with
a
brewery
who
focuses
on
drinkable
lagers
in
my
book
d
very
drinkable
this
beer
goes
down
well
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
was
surprised
on
how
much
i
liked
it
i
expected
worse
overall
i
have
had
better
pils
this
one
just
wasnt
too
hoppy
somewhat
drinkable
but
more
flavor
would
be
nice
one
of
shiners
better
brews
do
overall
not
a
bad
pilsner
an
easy
drinker
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
pils
and
this
was
the
best
beer
i
could
find
well
i
certainly
have
had
worse
days
than
that
thanks
spoetzl
drinkability
is
there
esp
cold
id
like
the
chance
to
get
six
in
the
summer
a
hot
day
tryout
seems
in
order
all
in
all
though
this
makes
it
easy
drinking
not
filling
or
over
powering
good
beer
to
start
the
halloween
party
night
a
passable
czech
pilsener
pretty
nice
not
bad
but
definitely
falls
short
of
a
well
made
czech
pilsner
it
is
refreshing
if
drunk
cold
on
a
hot
day
though
overall
an
average
cp
that
seems
to
fit
the
shiner
mold
lately
of
not
really
pushing
it
obviously
available
here
in
tx
rotation
not
really
one
of
my
goto
styles
and
it
didnt
stand
out
so
one
is
enough
for
me
nn
note
when
this
beer
is
fresh
it
is
much
much
better
i
was
almost
blownaway
by
the
beer
upon
its
initial
release
but
over
time
it
has
really
faded

on
this
when
you
buy
those
pilseners
imported
from
german
and
czech
republik
moderate
carbonation
and
a

full

good
malty

the
finish
not
overly
complex
but

and

bubbles

to
say
it
a

crispness
to
it
well
balanced

nicely
carbonated
with
the
bite
quickly
rolling
over
the
tongue
a
little
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
keeps
it
from
being
too
smooth
an
easy
drink
in
this
warm
weather
but
not
my
preferred
thirst
quenching
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
attempt
at
a
czech
pils
well
done
by
shiner
summary
this
is
a
good
beer
i
gave
it
a

or
a
c
this
is
a
very
simple
anniversary
beer
theres
no
bells
and
whistles
attached
and
no
hidden
tastes
or
smells
it
looks
like
a
medium
pilsner
and
tastes
somewhere
between
a
light
and
medium
pilsner
i
cant
compare
with
other
czechstyle
pilsners
because
this
is
the
first
ive
ever
had
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
notes
this
is
straight
up
one
of
the
cleanest
czech
pilsners
that
i
have
tried
i
like
to
see
delicate
pilsners

as
if

a

that
is
followed
by
a
light
grassy
fragrance

with
a

the
taste
right
at

it

itself
to

bitterness
brings
grassy
and
mild
citrus
flavors
that
stay
on
the
palate
long
after
each
taste
is
gone
a
watery
feel
at
the
front
with
the
cleansing
sensation
of
carbonation
coming
through
midway
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
palate
is
left
with
a
strong
lingering
arid
feel
a
solid
czech
style
pilsner
with
a
strong
and
appealing
color
the
aroma
may
not
be
as
spicy
as
i
would
have
expected
but
the
solid
flavor
and
classic
feel
make
up
fot
it
in
the
end
if
we
were
rating
bottle
lable
design
this
would
get
an
a
in
my
opinion
most
of
the
time
i
drink
shiners
brews
straight
from
the
bottle
because
imo
the
experience
between
the
bottle
and
glass
is
the
same
however
i
prefer
this
brew
be
poured
in
a
glass
pilsners
are
not
usually
my
pint
of
brew
but
this
one
was
pretty
darn
good
and
refreshing
worth
a
try
and
ill
probably
have
this
again
while
in
tx
at
2
50
a
pint
at
lizardos
im
down
mine
left
some
nice
lacing
behind
and
had
a
slight
bitterness
that
was
refreshing
i
like
this
one
much
better
than
their
shiner
blonde
i
wished
they
would
make
this
one
year
round
dthis
tastes
like
a
miller
lite
which
they
may
have
been
going
for
i
thought
i
was
going
to
get
an
american
presentation
of
a
czech
pilsner
as
described
on
the
label
but
this
is
just
american
macro
knockoff
back
to
the
drawing
boards
with
this
one
the
aroma
left
a
good
deal
to
be
desiredslight
hint
of
malt
but
not
much
more
on
every
other
count
it
was
averageas
another
reviewer
put
it
it
is
a
step
up
from
a
bmc
offering
but
isnt
up
to
snuff
in
comparison
with
other
craftbrewed
beers
of
the
same
style
needs
more
malt
to
give
the
beer
some
character
overall
this
beer
is
on
the
fringe
of
being
the
everyday
american
lager
that
claims
to
be
a
pilsner
though
the
malts
used
are
better
and
there
is
a
tad
more
hopsjust
a
tad
would
be
better
if
it
were
more
bold
still
drinkable
just
not
true
to
style
i
would
post
more
but
this
post
is
the
same
on
my
facebook
posts
so
i
would
not
be
as
accurate
as
i
initially
posted
my
findings
grabbed
this
one
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
probably
because
i
enjoyed
the
smokehouse
i
had
recently
bought
if
you
compare
this
one
to
a
bmc
product
it
is
excellent
the
light
biscuityhoppy
aromas
and
flavors
are
far
superior
to
the
mass
market
versions
compare
it
to
a
craft
pilsner
and
it
fails
whatever
it
was
only
a
buck
and
a
half
a
really
nice
pils
smelled
of
malts
and
grass
with
a
touch
of
hops
pale
orange
colour
white
head
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
very
hoppy
with
a
nice
malt
background
the
only
thing
i
would
change
would
be
to
add
more
of
a
malt
character
to
it
overall
a
very
nice
summer
lager

an
average

easy
drinking
pilsner
nice
american
version
of
the
style
had
it
again
about
a
week
later
and
it
was
rather
more
bitter
but
still
crisp
not
as
rubust
of
a
feel
though
this
is
very
drinkable
beer
and
capable
of
quenching
a
summer
thirst
for
what
this
beer
is
it
is
very
good
the
appear
is
golden
yellow
with
a
head
that
shows
up
and
fades
after
a
while
smells
like
grains
maybe
light
hops
the
taste
is
excellent
for
what
it
is
toasty
flavor
with
hops
way
in
the
background
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
clean
light
and
crisp
drinkability
is
top
notch
excellent
session
beer
i
think
spoetzl
makes
some
decent
lager
beersa
bit
modest
but
still
pretty
good
poured
into
a
czech
lager
glass
a
lighter
golden
shade
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
atop
aromas
were
mainly
minerallike
with
a
bit
of
toasty
grainflavors
are
light
and
crisp
with
some
of
that
ironminerala
bit
of
sweetnessand
a
decent
shot
of
spicy
saaz
in
the
finish
its
a
good
drinker
and
better
than
basicgreat
to
drink
while
grillin
out
on
a
hot
north
carolia
day
like
today
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
two
fingered
head
leaving
a
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
aromas
of
light
grains
and
malts
light
on
the
palate
with
nice
carbonation
hints
of
a
hoppy
citrus
finish
good
enough
of
a
brew
from
the
lone
star
state
found
it
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
darn
near
perfect
feeling
and
looking
czech
pils
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
malt
presence
but
the
hops
seemed
to
be
on
par
with
the
malt
element
i
paid
1
79
for
a
single
from
a
store
that
really
doesnt
markup
their
singles
at
all
so
by
my
math
this
must
be
going
for
around
11
a
sixer
if
this
is
so
its
too
much
coin
imho
id
stock
up
on
it
if
it
were
closer
to
7
49
or
something
good
pils
nonetheless
this
was
an
easy
drinker
and
one
i
could
have
had
the
entire
evening
well
done
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
milder
beer
that
is
worth
pounding
down
for
a
long
time
d
nice
little
pils
low
in
abv
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
little
session
beer
this
pilsner
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
appetizing
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
is
strong
fruity
yeasty
and
slightly
malty
fruity
and
somewhat
malty
flavor
is
rather
pleasing
if
not
outstanding
texture
is
very
smooth
and
slightly
fizzy
congratulations
to
shiner
for
101
years
of
brewing
and
counting
czechstyle
pilsner
isnt
as
good
as
commemorator
doppelbock
or
smokehaus
but
its
one
of
their
better
efforts
for
sure
bottom
line
fire
up
the
lawnmower
d
good
tasting
brew
but
i
couldnt
see
buying
a
six
pack
pretty
bland
overall
for
a
light
lager
not
the
worst
thing
ever
though
long
gone
are
the
days
when
spoetzl
actually
put
out
a
good
flavorful
lager
to
drink
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
many
around
my
neck
of
the
woods
will
simply
overlook
as
ordinary
this
is
a
beer
that
has
some
complex
characteristics
even
though
its
only
a
pilsner
if
you
can
find
this
brew
i
suggest
you
take
a
gulp
or
two
its
worth
a
sampling
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
was
looking
forward
to
enjoying
a
great
tasting
czech
brew
taking
me
back
to
my
travels
there
where
i
learned
that
beer
was
more
important
than
well
most
things
the
color
was
a
nice
straw
yellow
with
a
1
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
to
nothing
there
was
a
faint
malt
nose
but
some
bready
yeast
and
light
floral
hops
the
taste
was
clean
and
simple
with
nice
barley
and
hop
balance
not
a
wow
brew
though
just
plain
and
simple
and
maybe
that
is
all
they
were
going
for
if
so
this
one
gets
it
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
style
and
in
that
it
fell
a
bit
short
d
easy
drinkable
light
refreshing
and
goes
down
smooth
d
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
quite
a
good
summer
drink
pours
a
medium
gold
with
a
significant
head
that
slowly
dissipates
leaving
a
moderate
foam
layer
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
here
smell
features
a
pleasant
but
understated
hops
character
as
well
as
significant
graininess
taste
is
good
but
there
could
be
a
bit
more
hops
presence
as
well
as
a
bit
more
carbonation
fairly
decent
mouthfeel
but
again
there
could
be
a
bit
more
carbonation
a
decent
rendition
of
the
style
drinkability
having
lived
in
slovakia
for
three
months
i
had
many
czech
pilsners
this
is
a
faithful
interpretation
and
a
refreshing
yet
tasty
summer
beer
while
this
beer
is
pretty
nice
its
probably
just
as
well
it
isnt
available
in
this
market
its
a
solid
effort
but
imho
it
just
doesnt
compare
to
the
excellent
pilsners
one
can
find
from
victory
slyfox
troegs
and
stoudt
in
this
part
of
the
world
overall
a
nice
pilsener
which
can
be
a
difficult
style
to
do
well
saaz
hops
definitely
help
this
one
with
overall
flavor
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
has
a
light
golden
copper
color
and
is
crystal
clear
it
has
lots
of
carbonation
thats
flows
to
a
semi
thick
about
one
and
a
half
fingers
white
bubbly
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
there
is
some
good
lacing
in
this
beer
it
has
a
good
malt
aroma
mixed
in
with
some
wheat
and
other
grains
its
light
on
the
tongue
crisp
and
clean
i
can
taste
some
malt
flavors
some
mild
hops
very
mild
hops
and
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
the
hops
flavor
stands
out
a
little
more
after
it
warms
up
a
bit
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
ill
be
buying
another
pack
sometime
soon
atmosphere
is
really
solid
great
appearance
and
a
really
nice
combination
of
grain
and
spice
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
an
outstanding
balance
of
components
all
pure
and
pristine
with
nothing
really
standing
out
of
the
others
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
beer
of
this
style
i
would
prefer
more
saaz
flavor
i
wonder
if
texas
water
is
too
hard
for
a
pilz
as
well
maybe
that
has
something
to
do
with
the
taste
i
probably
wouldnt
get
again
its
good
but
nothing
special
probably
the
best
shiner
beer
ive
had
overall
this
is
by
no
means
the
best
from
spoetzl
i
have
had
almost
all
shiner
beer
available
in
ohio
and
i
am
a
pretty
big
fan
but
this
one
was
a
let
down
the
other
thing
that
i
cant
help
but
get
past
is
that
i
think
i
am
underrating
this
a
bit
because
i
had
a
sam
adams
noble
pils
the
other
week
and
that
was
just
by
far
my
favorite
sam
adams
and
i
am
using
that
unfortunately
as
a
basis
for
comparison
on
other
pilsners
i
have
a
few
more
left
in
my
6pack
which
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
but
it
may
be
awhile
until
i
come
back
to
shiner
for
a
pils
opinion
well
overall
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
is
a
little
closer
to
a
helles
in
style
than
a
pilsner
from
the
overall
balance
which
i
like
but
is
going
to
cost
it
some
points
i
definitely
dont
get
the
saaz
upside
the
head
like
some
czech
style
lagers
are
i
only
have
a
single
of
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
so
i
may
pick
some
more
up
here
pretty
soon
if
the
price
is
right
either
way
i
would
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
shot
it
is
clean
and
well
brewed
poured
into
a
pint
glass
formed
a
12
white
head
above
the
clear
golden
brew
head
falls
at
reasonable
pace
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
balanced
between
sweet
pale
malt
and
earthy
saaz
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
crsip
close
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
easy
good
stuff
d
very
good
drinkability
the
flavors
reflect
a
wellmade
brew
just
not
quite
to
style
for
what
the
label
is
advertising
cheers
d
i
didnt
find
anything
all
that
special
about
this
still
its
fairly
well
done
and
a
fine
session
brew
d
excellent
very
thirst
quenching
overall
dry
crisp
and
pleasant
drinkability
sufficiently
sessionable
i
suppose
but
for
me
it
just
lacks
that
saaz
hop
bite
im
looking
for
on
a
side
note
ill
say
it
is
nice
to
see
shiner
continuing
the
series
beyond
the
shiner
100
commemorator
finally
the
search
for
a
great
session
beer
yields
a
good
one
too
bad
its
a
seasonal
in
fact
too
bad
its
a
onetime
brew
gorgeous
orange
to
pale
amber
in
the
glass
with
nice
tan
head
that
stayed
briefly
then
laced
the
upper
part
of
the
pub
glass
fruity
somewhat
light
floral
hops
with
an
undercurrent
of
biscuity
malt
in
the
nose
coupled
with
the
surprisingly
moderate
mouthfeel
and
subtle
carbonation
the
nicely
balanced
flavor
was
incredibly
satisfying
and
drinkable
amazing
beer
nothing
too
complex
of
course
but
you
could
knock
a
few
of
these
back
and
never
get
tired
of
it
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
adequate
carbonation
not
the
best
pils
out
there
but
engaging
enough
to
drink
3
or
4
watching
the
game
or
hanging
out
at
the
lake
not
a
huge
shiner
fan
but
they
did
a
pretty
good
job
on
this
one
non
of
these
pilslager
types
from
shiner
are
worth
buying
all
share
the
same
characteristic
crappy
watered
down
soul
and
extreme
boring
nature
avoid
d
not
very
interesting
and
pretty
carbonated
makes
this
not
super
drinkable
and
rather
forgettable
overall
impression
is
this
the
most
exciting
beer
out
there
not
by
a
long
shot
but
it
is
a
solid
offering
highly
drinkable
with
some
nice
pilsner
flavors
notes
this
is
probably
the
best
czechstyle
pils
ive
had
though
i
admit
my
experience
with
the
style
is
limited
im
guessing
its
because
its
much
fresher
than
the
real
czech
stuff
we
get
over
here
in
particular
i
like
how
the
bready
aftertaste
balances
the
sharp
hops
so
well
d
smooth
although
it
reminds
me
of
the
frost
and
of
the
koschstyle
nothing
spectacularly
new
here
d
very
drinkable
beer
you
can
drink
a
ton
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
was
pleasently
surprised
with
this
with
all
the
specialty
and
extreme
beers
on
the
market
i
think
its
rather
refreshing
that
shiner
has
put
out
a
well
crafted
pilsner
yea
its
another
safe
beer
from
shiner
but
as
far
as
pilsners
go
i
can
enjoy
this
one
this
is
what
my
craft
fence
sitting
friends
drink
and
ive
been
having
it
a
lot
lately
d
easy
drinking
seems
lightly
filling
at
times
no
idea
on
the
abv
but
as
a
pils
it
cant
beat
me
up
too
bad
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
and
does
a
fine
job
of
representing
this
style
not
as
hoppy
as
the
lagunitas
pils
and
lacking
the
brightness
and
the
buttery
feel
of
the
urquell
but
holds
its
own
and
is
supremely
drinkable
rjt
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
a
style
that
i
seek
out
but
it
has
a
decent
taste
thats
light
and
refreshing
worth
trying
sometime
verdict
101
is
another
pleasant
very
shineresque
though
ultimately
unmemorable
pale
lager
from
shiner
97
was
so
good
that
its
a
shame
to
see
yet
another
lackluster
beer
in
this
series
guys
do
us
all
a
favor
and
be
a
little
more
daring
next
yearit
paid
off
the
last
time
d
yet
another
mediocre
beer
from
the
spoetzl
brewery
its
okay
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
taste
is
light
malts
with
a
touch
more
sweetness
than
i
am
used
to
in
a
czech
style
pilsner
hops
are
more
detectable
in
the
taste
than
the
nose
indicated
but
still
pretty
lightly
hopped
there
is
a
light
lagery
sulfur
flavor
in
there
as
well
while
shiner
101
is
pretty
true
to
style
it
is
a
pretty
uninspiring
version
yes
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
it
is
not
the
cleanest
pilsner
and
the
flavors
are
slightly
dull
thanks
shiner
shiner
101
exhibits
a
clear
golden
body
with
stark
white
foam
clean
sweet
pilsener
malt
and
an
herbal
grassy
noble
hop
presence
all
requisites
for
the
style
the
only
problem
is
that
each
component
lacks
just
a
bit
compared
to
the
standards
of
the
style
the
head
recedes
quickly
the
malt
becomes
a
bit
watery
at
the
end
and
the
hops
dont
pop
nearly
enough
especially
in
the
aroma
that
said
101
is
still
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
and
one
that
i
would
gladly
consume
again
especially
on
a
warm
afternoon
cant
wait
to
make
a
session
of
this
once
the
thermometer
warms
up
here
in
houston
as
another
poster
stated
this
beer
should
replace
the
subpar
hefeweizen
as
a
year
round
brew
this
is
a
shiner
beer
id
drink
over
and
over
again
in
the
warmer
months
id
love
for
this
to
become
a
yearround
beer
in
place
of
the
hefe
if
i
had
my
way
this
is
very
sessionable
given
that
this
is
probably
low
in
abv
but
i
wont
go
for
this
again
glad
i
tried
it
though
d
quite
drinkable
although
i
still
prefer
the
frost
overall
in
comparing
recent
shiner
offerings
this
brew
was
about
what
i
would
expect
from
a
shiner
pilsener
in
that
it
is
a
little
conservative
minerals
and
grain
husks
hit
the
palate
first
tasting
slightly
of
sulfur
and
light
pilsner
malt
the
hops
add
a
decent
enough
balance
with
notes
of
herbal
grasses
and
a
touch
of
bitter
pine
taste
improves
as
the
tongue
adjusts
to
the
carbonation
level
as
the
light
body
goes
down
smooth
but
never
suggests
itself
to
be
watery
all
in
all
i
found
shiner
101
to
be
a
pretty
decent
czech
pilsner
nothing
great
but
if
anythingthese
guys
are
consistent
happy
onehundredandfirst
spoetzl
shiner
101
is
very
straight
forward
no
frills
type
of
beer
its
a
great
choice
for
just
casual
drinking
and
would
pair
nicely
with
barbeque
while
not
deviated
far
from
your
typical
macro
lager
it
deviates
with
much
more
mouthfeel
which
provides
a
nice
creaminess
a
bit
more
flavor
and
good
drinkability
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
beer
is
very
clear
the
aroma
is
wheat
malt
and
some
grassy
hops
i
also
get
a
slight
butteryness
the
flavor
is
similar
with
a
nice
touch
of
bitterness
from
the
grassy
hops
the
butter
is
there
as
well
taking
away
from
the
overall
flavor
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
an
unremarkable
beer
but
one
of
the
better
ones
from
shiner
just
picked
this
up
at
the
local
heb
plus
off
anderson
mill
pours
with
a
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
head
completely
transparent
in
body
smells
like
every
czech
pilsner
i
have
had
reminds
me
exactly
of
pilsner
urquell
i
enjoy
the
bitterness
czech
pilsners
usually
have
this
beer
was
no
different
and
even
had
less
of
a
bite
than
i
thought
it
would
this
was
smooth
from
start
to
finish
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
this
beer
lacked
flavor
it
was
light
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
meh
just
not
my
style
i
guess
overall
there
are
better
lager
pilsner
beers
available
in
this
price
range
i
dont
think
ill
be
bothering
with
this
one
again
clear
golden
color
crisp
refreshing
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
maltiness
kind
of
your
runofthemill
pilsner
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
nice
pilsner
very
light
to
drink
not
a
bad
initial
impression
somewhat
sweet
and
hoppy
but
finishes
with
notes
of
bitterness
overall
not
bad
especially
at
16
9
ounces
but
not
something
id
personally
go
running
back
to
i
certainly
dont
expect
an
imported
lager
to
have
the
same
freshness
as
it
does
in
its
home
country
that
said
i
was
very
surprise
with
what
i
got
out
of
krušovice
imperial
ill
be
returning
to
this
czech
beer
but
i
guarantee
that
it
will
be
within
seven
years
this
is
a
nice
beer
in
its
look
and
aroma
it
is
unfortunate
that
although
it
started
well
it
finished
rather
harshly
which
really
unbalanced
the
beer
and
sullied
what
was
a
very
promising
czech
pilsner
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
grassy
malty
some
sweetness
taste
is
crisp
grassy
hops
some
malts
a
bit
dry
at
the
finish
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
the
smell
would
have
indicated
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good

on

on

this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp

overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
initial
skunk
aroma
coming
from
the
bottle
is
quite
potent
and
never
quite
goes
away
o
very
good
in
every
category
except
the
one
that
truly
counts
taste
looks
great
smells
great

great
tastes
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
its
like
an
astringent
plastic
bad
bottle
maybe
everything
else
was
so
good
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
i
imagine
that
this
bottle
being
6
months
old
has
caused
it
to
lose
some
of
hop
qualities
rjt
krušovice
doesnt
break
any
new
ground
for
the
style
yet
is
certainly
quite
drinkable
and
solid
representation
of
the
style
the
beer
poured
clear
darker
ambergolden
color
that
produced
a
big
slightly
off
white
head
that
faded
quickly
into
thin
cap
the
beer
gave
off
a
nice
lager
aroma
sweet
malt
and
yeast
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
malty
sweet
as
well
but
also
had
a
syrup
quality
to
it
which
was
very
unexpected
this
contributed
to
the
lesser
feel
rating
with
that
said
the
beer
was
still
rather
smooth
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
maybe
it
just
didnt
travel
well
or
maybe
it
was
old
i
am
willing
to
give
this
one
another
shot
as
i
am
really
into
the
style
o
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
overall
i
like
it
and
its
honestly
something
you
have
to
try
it
was
a
surprise
all
i
can
say
its
pils
with
a
surprisee
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
conclusion
full
bodied
brew
with
a
earthycrunchy
taste
lacks
a
bit
of

notes
for
my
own
taste
overall
honestly
i
am
impressed
poruing
it
into
my
glass
i
was
just
thinking
ehh
this
is
going
to
be
okay
and
to
my
surprise
yum
for
around
two
bucks
a
bottle
at
your
local

you
got

o
decent
pilsner
at
a
great
price
highly
drinkable
o
another
refreshing
pilsner
better
than
some
ive
had
recently
overall
this
beer
brings
back
memories
of
praguepraha
and
my
time
spent
in
banska
bystrica
now
wish
i
could
go
back
this
winter
for
some
snowboarding
and
apres
board
there
were
was
much
better
across
the
pond
and
the
scenery
and
the
culture
made
it
exceptionally
better
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
more
often
a
well
balanced
brew
perhaps
a
bit
too
smooth
the
classic
label
design
leads
you
to
believe
that
they
know
what
theyre
doing
and
the
bottle
has
gold
foil
covering
the
neck
the
kiss
your
pinched
fingers
final
touch
that
lets
you
know
that
these
guys
have
a
lot
of
pride
in
their
product
the
labels
says
this
brewery
has
been
at
it
since
the
1500s
so
theyve
had
plenty
of
time
to
tweak
their
recipe
and
get
it
just
right
and
i
believe
theyve
done
just
that
brought
a
can
of
krusovice
imperial
home
from
a
recent
trip
to
europe
the
beer
was
golden
cleal
with
foamy
white
head
to
start
which
then
faded
there
was
some
initial
lacing
but
eventually
that
ceased
as
well
the
smell
was
malt
and
maybe
a
hint
of
some
czech
hops
the
taste
begins
with
a
smooth
malt
taste
that
just
stays
throughout
the
whole
taste
mouthfeel
was
good
had
nice
carbonation
and
was
medium
bodied
smooth
overall
was
a
good
beer
and
would
recommend
it
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
probably
had
about
24
of
these
during
my
trip
definitely
a
worth
beer
to
try
out
o
sweet
and
grainy
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
notes
this
one
is
very
good
and
well
rounded
a
good
one
to
pick
up
cheers
overall
nice
balanced
pilsner
like
the
vanilla
in
the
smell
this
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
hefty
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
doughy
malt
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
on
the
palate
the
flavor
is
sweet
while
still
managing
some
husky
grain
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
smoother
than
some
other
beers
that
i
have
had
from
eastern
europe
i
run
a
bar
and
i
brought
this
beer
in
before
ever
having
it
this
was
defintily
one
of
the
best
czech
pils
i
have
ever
had
very
crisp
and
clean
with
nice
carbonation
if
you
want
to
taste
a
great
beer
definitly
pick
this
one
up
was
able
to
buy
this
bottle
individualy
for
1
25
a
bottle
and
its
worth
every
penny
and
more
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
and
inoffensive
beer
nothing
that
stands
out
but
thats
what
makes
it
drinkable
overall
if
imperial
ever
meant
something
it
was
this
light
alcoholic
beer
that
contains
a
ton
of
character
and
flavor
i
would
feel
fine
enjoying
this
beer
with
a
nice
heavy
dinner
in
which
i
needed
a
full
flavored
beer
to
wash
down
my
meal
had
this
shortly
after
sampling
golden
pheasant
but
this
is
a
notch
hoppier
the
herbal
lemon
is
a
stronger
and
and
it
also
has
a
more
pleasant
balance
of
malt
to
hops
the
barley
bring
a
toasty
caramel
while
theres
a
hint
of
herbal
licorice
the
hoppy
finish
has
a
lemon
juice
and
pepper
character
thats
dry
but
satisfying
pours
a
deep
golden
color
almost
copper
with
large
thick
head
aroma
is
pretty
weak
but
mostly
sweet
malts
with
a
little
hay
and
grassy
hoppiness
evident
taste
is
sweet
up
front
almost
candylike
followed
up
by
a
strong
grassy
hop
flavor
with
a
light
but
pleasant
bitter
finish
the
palate
is
a
strong
point
of
this
beer
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
slighty
oily
texture
there
is
also
a
fine
carbonation
giving
it
a
soft
mouthfeel
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
pilsener
but
it
really
offers
nothing
spectacular
and
comes
off
a
bit
dull
future
outlook
dont
know
where
this
brew
came
from
nothing
spectacular
but
a
pleasant
simple
easy
drinking
brew
that
would
do
well
on
a
sweltering
day
no
matter
glad
to
have
tried
but
not
compelling
enough
for
seeking
out
not
bad
for
the
price
only
3
here
in
alberta
worth
a
try
for
sure
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
i
went
into
this
with
fairly
low
expectations
and
found
myself
pleasantly
surprised
flavorful
and
well
balanced
while
not
my
favorite
style
this
a
solid
beer
it
may
have
helped
trying
this
one
on
tap
in
germany
but
the
bottle
serving
version
is
not
far
behind
as
i
tried
a
case
worth
of
that
serving
type
also
poured
a
light
gold
with
a
2
head
which
settled
down
to
usta
trace
the
taste
was
comparable
to
american
pilsners
but
with
just
a
little
bit
more
of
everything
theres
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
some
sweet
malt
and
the
grains
come
across
more
like
a
rye
with
an
aftertaste
better
than
the
masses
but
just
barely
drinkability
light
and
tasty
it
is
quite
drinkable
as
a
pilsner
should
be
drinkability
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
great
in
a
bottle
but
better
on
draft
i
have
only
seen
it
on
draft
in
the
czech
republic
but
maybe
some
pub
carries
it
here
in
the
states
pours
a
clear
pale
goldenyellow
with
a
big
almost
3
fingers
puffy
white
head
with
moderate
retention
and
decent
lacing
nose
is
mild
mostly
consisting
of
a
grainymalty
aroma
with
some
hops
swirling
about
as
well
more
of
the
same
in
its
flavor
with
a
decided
but
not
overwhelming
bitterness
to
it
crisp
lightbodied
mouthfeel
could
easily
do
a
few
of
these
overall
nothing
to
go
wild
for
but
a
nice
unobtrusive
pilsner
reviewing
with
style
in
mind
overallnot
a
great
beer
inoffensive
at
best
once
the
novelty
wears
off
there
isnt
much
left
if
this
was
what
the
typical
bmc
was
wed
be
better
off
for
it
bottled
on
04152010
pretty
damn
fresh
for
an
european
import
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
solid
one
inch
of
dense
head
the
head
has
very
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
pretty
damn
impressive
looking
for
a
pilsener
the
aroma
has
more
going
for
it
than
a
saaz
hop
smell
definately
pick
up
on
a
sweeter
malt
bill
than
others
of
the
style
the
hops
also
smell
fresh
rather
than
skunky
definately
benefits
from
being
fresh
the
flavor
starts
dry
and
bitter
but
finishes
from
a
slightly
sweet
note
plenty
of
hop
flavor
in
this
one
the
saaz
are
nicely
featured
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
dry
without
some
relief
from
a
touch
of
sweet
i
do
not
know
what
the
other
reviewers
were
drinking
but
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
pils
definatley
will
pick
it
up
again
d
a
good
pilsener
for
the
style
normally
i
do
not
reach
for
anything
in
this
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
when
considering
the
style
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
im
surprised
this
beer
got
so
many
average
to
below
average
ratings
on
here
that
just
doesnt
do
justice
to
it
to
be
honest
i
tried
it
a
few
years
back
and
wasnt
too
pleased
with
it
at
that
time
but
i
gave
it
another
shot
last
week
and
was
very
impressed
with
how
flavourful
it
was
maybe
they
improved
it
lately
or
maybe
i
just
had
a
fresh
bottle
anyways
this
time
around
this
stuff
was
damn
good
plenty
of
hop
flavour
of
the
saaz
variety
i
think
and
accompanied
by
a
decent
malty
character
as
well
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
hoppy
before
the
level
of
bitterness
is
just
right
though
strong
but
not
too
overpowering
full
flavoured
but
drinkable
it
produced
a
substantial
head
too
that
lingered
til
the
last
drop
and
had
a
full
aroma
of
hops
those
czechs
know
what
theyre
doing
when
it
comes
to
beer
making
ill
tell
ya
right
up
there
with
the
germans
ill
defintely
be
partaking
in
some
more
of
this
in
the
near
future
hehe
one
of
the
best
euro
lagers
ive
had
in
a
while
high
drinkability
which
flows
down
easy
but
the
flavors
so
basic
that
its
almost
too
boring
to
drink
all
night
not
good
not
bad
just
a
decent
basic
beer
sinkability
this
was
a
notch
below
blah
d
eminently
drinkable
it
might
not
be
boutique
enough
for
beer
snobs
but
it
tastes
like
a
czech
beer
should
complex
enough
to
drink
with
meat
dishes
yet
light
enough
for
just
sitting
around
on
the
couch
watching
a
ball
game
might
be
my
new
staple
d
the
beer
is
rather
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
im
not
sure
if
i
would
call
it
sessionable
because
the
taste
was
a
bit
bland
and
could
not
keep
my
interest
for
more
than
one
refreshing
enough
but
nothing
mind
blowing
appearance
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
thick
lasting
head
leaving
a
fair
lace
smell
and
taste
of
earthy
grains
light
honey
and
saaz
hops
mouthfeel
has
good
body
and
carbonation
ive
had
better
pilseners
but
its
not
bad
just
a
little
tinny
for
me
i
like
the
ingredients

it

aftertaste
of
bittering
hops
the
taste
mimicks
the
aroma
almost
exactly
slippery
sweet
film
is
left
on
the
teeth
slight
creamy
texture
with
the
right
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
the
czechs
do
it
right
pours
a
lovely
golden
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
has
good
retention
lacing
is
somewhat
poor
but
the
nice
little
bubbles
trailing
up
my
tall
pilsener
glass
keep
me
entertained
it
gives
off
the
aroma
of
soft
floral
hops
and
bready
malt
this
is
a
very
clean
smelling
brew
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
soft
herbal
sweetly
grassy
and
flowery
hop
flavor
mingling
with
white
bread
malt
sweetness
firm
bitterness
but
lacking
some
of
the
spice
and
zing
of
other
czech
pils
the
finish
is
dry
and
fairly
clean
with
just
enough
sweetness
this
is
a
light
bodied
and
very
quaffable
beer
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
quite
tasty
not
bad
for
a
2
bottle
of
beer
but
not
up
to
par
with
what
i
enjoy
d
the
thick
rich
malt
character
is
excellent
and
the
spicy
hops
are
spot
on
as
well
especially
in
the
aroma
the
balance
of
honey
and
smooth
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
exactly
what
one
expects
from
a
czech
pilsner
there
is
a
little
sulphur
aroma
from
the
yeast
which
may
be
technically
acceptable
but
i
would
still
prefer
the
beer
without
it
im
sure
that
this
beer
has
lost
a
little
of
its
character
during
its
long
trip
from
central
europe
to
the
shelves
of
my
local
beer
store
but
it
is
still
in
pretty
good
shape
and
i
cant
find
too
much
to
complain
about
here
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
intense
stouts
and
ipas
that
i
like
most
bas
often
focus
on
overall
a
decent
brew
nothing
spectacular
but
it
gets
the
job
done
id
recommend
this
as
a
step
above
heineken
or
other
euro
pale
lagers
would
go
very
well
in
the
cooler
at
your
next
summer
barbecue
ill
be
drinking
this
one
again
very
drinkable
czech
pils
all
in
all
meh
ive
had
much
better
pilsners
a
drinkable
rather
well
balanced
pilsner
the
body
was
typical
for
the
style
clean
smooth
and
crisp
drinkability
was
very
good
you
would
want
to
and
could
have
several
of
these
brews
easily
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
d
nothing
offensive
it
taste
like
a
macro
beer
meant
to
be
swilled
not
enjoyed
its
easy
to
drink
just
nothing
special
this
beer
is
very
good
this
beer
really
took
me
by
surprise
it
is
light
as
a
good
pilsner
a
real
staple
in
pilsner
beer
probably
as
good
as
pilsner
urquell
i
thought
this
beer
was
really
good
it
was
very
thin
but
good
the
taste
was
very
good
as
well
with
hints
of
citrus
and
is
semi
bitter
d
a
descent
czech
pilsener
it
goes
down
smoothly
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
not
really
putting
this
one
to
bed

biscuit
lemony
and
grassy

leave
you
with
an
appropriate
level

thanks
milos
seemed
better
on
tap
in
prague
in
my
dining
room
it
was
just
another
beer
for
me
to
review
and
try
as
i
did
no
redeeming
features
came
to
its
rescue
this
is
a
bog
standard
pilsner
clean
and
sweet
lager

with
some
light
grainy
malts
and
a
bit
of
breadiness
notable
noble
hop
nose
clean
and
grassy
fairly
dry
in
flavor
and
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
that
balances
well
with
a
moderate
malt
backbone
solid
feel
and
drink
nice
example
of
the
style
that
doesnt
overwhelm
pilseners
are
simple
but
amazing
beers
this
one
is
average
i
think
in
this
category
d
the
first
few
sips
of
this
baby
were
truly
impressive
but
it
mediocred
out
by
the
end
nice
but
not
challenging
no
obvious
flaws
but
not
inspiring
either
bright
amber
in
color
with
a
bubbly
head
that
audibly
fizzes
as
it
dissipates
a
steady
line
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
adds
appeal
too
the
aroma
is
a
tad
fruity
but
mostly
grainy
some
grass
as
well
nice
taste
lemons
grass
and
somewhat
malty
with
a
decent
dose
of
hops
at
the
back
but
not
really
very
bitter
at
all
mild
carbonation
and
a
low
abv
make
this
easy
to
drink
so
does
the
price
about
2
a
bottle
worth
gathering
a
few
for
the
fridge
the
beer
pours
a
solid
gold
color
with
ok
head
retention
and
minimal
lacing
i
dont
get
a
lot
on
the
nose
just
some
light
honey
and
pepper
flavors
on
the
palate
generally
replicate
the
nose
with
the
beer
having
a
light
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
but
there
was
nothing
watery
about
the
beer
drinkability
was
pretty
good
and
this
low
alcohol
pilsnerlager
was
exactly
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
on
a
warm
muggy
day
in
baltimore
notes
pleasant
surprise
glad
that
i
took
the
relative
chance
and
had
this
one
overall
finishes
as
it
starts
rather
predicatbly
but
not
awfully
while
avoiding
the
butt
some
pilsners
in
green
bottles
will
peddle
very
drinkable
light
to
medium
body
smooth
overall
w
faint
resins
in
finish
crisp
not
too
fizzy
carbonation
giving
further
body
had
it
on
tap
on
a
hot
day
at
a
local
restaurant
in
salem
ma
at
best
i
can
say
it
was
pretty
average
it
certainly
wasnt
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
ive
ever
had
but
it
wasnt
that
good
either
it
was
a
lot
more
pale
than
i
expected
especially
to
use
the
term
imperial
it
did
not
have
a
strong
aroma
you
could
smell
some
hop
notes
to
it
i
was
very
disappointed
with
the
overall
flavor
again
because
they
use
the
term
imperial
i
found
it
very
bland
like
i
said
it
was
a
hot
day
and
it
was
a
cold
beer
so
it
was
was
refreshing
enough
for
me
to
consider
the
mouth
feel
and
drinkablility
to
be
average
not
a
bad
tasting
pilsener
it
just
wasnt
very
interesting
d
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
not
too
bad
for
a
pils
ps
thanks
mom
for
this
surprise
grab
bag
beer
its
a
decent
beer
has
strong
metallic
element
similar
to
what
i
remember
a
heineken
tasting
like
but
much
better
would
recommend
trying
out
d
a
very
pleasant
surprise
easily
the
best
czech
pilsner
ive
ever
had
in

id
put
it
in
the

the
better

bittersweet

definitely
a

this
bottle
at
sams
in
chi
this
has
a
palate
wetting
quality
and
goes
down
smoothly
its
on
par
for
the
style
but
i
like
my
german
pils
a
bit
better
overall
a
good
and
very
refreshing
czech

i
enjoyed
this

a

nothing

the

almost

it
doesnt
taste
awful
like
other

better
than

this

d
i
am
a
big
fan
of
good
czech
pilsner
beers
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
lager
from
the
czech
republic
not
bad
at
all
but
nothing
special
either
a
decent
novelty
beer
the
czech
republic
like
wheres
that
to
enjoy
at
cookouts
perhaps
d
might
want
to
rethink
the
recipe
the
beer
is
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
faded
pretty
quickly
for
me
i
could
smell
a
light
grassyhoppy
aroma
i
couldnt
pick
up
much
of
a
malt
flavor
when
i
tasted
it
the
hops
came
out
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
strong
but
good
hoppy
grassy
flavor
i
felt
like
there
was
a
bit
of
a
creamy
texture
to
the
beer
which
i
didnt
expect
but
found
pleasing
pours

a
slightly
murky

with
a

mellovescent
shine
when
held
up
to
the

little
yet
long
lasting

the

of
chobile

some
lighter

like

and
very
similar
of
a
smell
to
the
african
baobab
fruit
taste
is
of

very
remeniscant
of
my
grandmama
the
body
was

that

an
egyptian

low

a
very
virtuous
beer
overall
a
slightly
aboveaverage
pilsener
but
it
holds
its
own

without
being
mediocre
definitely
leaning
more
towards
the
malt
side
in
the
end
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottlegolden
yellow
with
foamy
white
head
that
turns
to
a
decent
collar
and
mild
sticky
lacing
very
fresh
aroma
with
hops
and
grass
coming
througha
little
peppery
in
there
too
taste
is
refreshing
and
clean
with
fresh
grains
and
grass
coming
at
you
and
a
peppery
bite
to
it
and
solid
bitterness
finishing
it
offdry
aftertaste
at
the
very
end
and
the
pepper
there
too
once
again
medium
to
full
body
with
good
amount
of
carbs
in
therethose
bubbles
seem
endlesswell
worth
a
trygood
brewquite
enjoyable
to
me
taste
is
strong
malty
which
makes
the
beer
quite
big
but
doesnt
interfere
with
the
drinkability
the
malt
is
grainy
a
bit
caramellized
and
has
a
bready
crusty
taste
a
clean
bitterness
which
is
just
a
little
bit
soapy
d
i
enjoyed
this
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
big
or
overpowering
overall
its
not
bad
i
would
have
it
again
on
ocasion
but
im
a
bit
dissapointed
with
it
because
this
brewery
has
much
better
choices
the
taste
is
the
typical
czech
sharp
hop
from
the
saaz
variety
fairly
dry
malty
graininess
with
some
bittering
dry
herbal
tastes
in
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
metallic
and
mustiness
to
the
beer
especially
on
the
back
end
my
guess
is
that
the
former
is
characteristic
the
latter
is
due
to
the
lack
of
freshness
overall
i
will
try
this
beer
again
albeit
with
a
fresher
label
date
and
see
if
my
conclusions
are
borne
out
decent
pilners
will
probably
quaff
a
few
of
these
while
in
stock
this
july
yellow
with
foamy
bubbly
white
head
a
bit
beery
aroma
average
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
grainy
dry
and
rough
but
one
can
get
through
it
i
think
those
who
expect
this
to
be
an
imperial
pilsner
as
opposed
to
a
pilsner
maybe
a
tad
disapointed
looked
fantastic
after
the
pour
a
golden
yelloworange
color
with
a
big
white
fluffy
head
that
bubbled
down
very
slowly
to
a
lace
across
the
whole
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
decent
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
and
a
lot
of
bready
malts
i
was
not
much
of
a
fan
of
the
taste
up
front
is
was
the
bready
malts
again
plus
some
other
grainy
tastes
which
to
me
was
kind
of
bland
there
was
some
hoppiness
at
the
end
but
it
was
more
of
a
small
fizzle
of
taste
rather
than
a
compliment
it
was
somewhat
sweet
but
in
a
way
that
left
the
beer
feeling
a
little
too
heavy
and
syrupy
for
me
despite
the
thin
and
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
all
in
all
i
think
there
are
a
lot
better
czech
pilseners
out
there
d
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
little
czech
pils
im
loving
the
dryness
of
this
one
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
highly
refreshing
i
can
see
myself
having
a
lot
of
this
beer
this
summer
the
taste
is
surprisingly
earthy
with
toasty
bread
caramel
leaves
a
little
pine
and
a
quite
a
bit
of
citrus
particularly
lemon
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
after
starting
light
the
bitterness
soon
increaseas
to
make
a
very
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
golden
color
with
a
head
that
didnt
last
long
and
left
no
lacing
smells
of
grain
and
bread
with
a
very
faint
carmel
smell
taste
starts
smooth
and
has
a
very
bitter
and
heavily
carbonated
end
with
some
pine
and
citrus
flavors
over
all
it
has
a
sour
taste
that
i
didnt
enjoy
had
this
while
on
tour
in
atlanta
bought
on
base
in
a
20
ounce
bottle
poured
it
assuming
id
experience
an
imperial
flavor
but
was
met
with
nothing
more
than
ale
style
flavor
and
mouthfeel
a
let
down
and
couldnt
even
finish
the
bottle
it
tasted
so
bad
switched
to
stella
after
14
of
the
bottle
and
dumped
it
down
the
drain
will
never
buy
this
again
but
then
again
maybe
some
more
refined
palates
find
something
redeemable
in
this
swill
overall
a
good
and
tasty
pils
good
drinkability
nice
looking
golden
lager
white

sweet
aroma
of
the
euro
skunk
slides
into
the
quaff
along
with
the
crisp
lager
malts
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
decent
brew
that
finishes
crisply
good
hop
balance
this
would
drink
well
in
the
summer
heat
but
the
import
price
will
probably
keep
it

a
pretty
easy

this
is
one
i
could
see
enjoying
a
full
pint
of
on
a
patio
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
vaclavske
namesti
wishful
thinking
or
elsewhere
probably
even
more
so
a
decent
if
a
tad
reserved
version
of
the
best
pilseners
out
there
even
though
its
got
the
look
down
pat
dnot
outstanding
but
serviceable
i
prefer
the
cerny
to
this
but
it
is
a
refreshing
pils
an
exceedingly
drinkable
pilsner
i
will
revisit
this
one
again
sometime
the
beer
upon
the
poor
presents
a
clear
gold
with
a
modest
creamy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
thin
but
complete
sheet
to
cover
the
glass
nose
has
a
sweet
malt
aroma
crisp
and
clean
front
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
decent
malt
presence
top
is
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
pedestrian
acidity
the
hops
adequately
spicy
dry
and
sweet
until
the
end
a
drinkable
beer
and
better
than
many
i
have
sampled
this
beer
was
over
a
year
old
according
to
the
born
on
date
but
still
had
a
lot
left
lacing
continued
to
impress
and
the
total
package
was
very
well
put
together
impressive
pilsener
moderately
dark
golden
color
with
a
modest
head
the
taste
exudes
hops
with
a
decent
bitter
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
has
good
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
smooth
and
hoppy
strong
and
bold
in
taste
with
a
good
finish
worth
grabbing
a
second
yet
also
works
well
in
dialogue
with
a
good
smooth
porter
or
stout
one
id
recommend
without
reservation
pours
a
clean
straw
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
os
sweet
malt
and
somewhat
fruity
like
green
apples
in
the
taste
small
fruitiness
green
apples
that
goes
from
sweet
to
dry
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
fruity
aftertaste
light
on
the
palate
and
refreshing
krusovice
imperial
pours
a
dark
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
laces
nicely
from
a
brown
half
liter
bottle
the
aroma
is
grassy
the
flavor
is
grassy
hops
with
a
touch
of
hoppy
spiciness
in
the
forefront
a
mild
malt
flavor
toward
the
end
provides
a
solid
backbone
not
bad
im
pleasantly
surprised
i
wasnt
expecting
much
when
i
bought
it
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
euro
strong
lager
type
of
beer
based
on
the
imperial
designation
but
its
a
decent
czech
pils
d
ive
partaken
in
this
fantastic
brew
at
a
local
czech
run
bar
and
i
still
think
it
is
worthwhile
i
have
had
and
will
have
again
drinkability
enjoyable
enough
pilsner
that
i
would
have
again

at
the
san
luis
obispo
bevmo
solid
in
a
bottle
much
better
off
the
tap
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
wouldnt
really
avoid
drinking
it
the
beer
is
quite
nice
the
best
way
to
describe
it
is
wonderfully
subdued
if
your
looking
for
a
pliny
or
storm
king
look
elsewhere
if
you
just
want
a
quality
beer
you
can
enjoy
and
like
drinking
this
is
it
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
brewerys
schwarzbier
and
from
what
ive
heard
their
light
lager
is
not
to
be
bothered
with
thier
imperial
turns
out
to
be
quite
decent
for
starters
the
bottle
i
got
was
not
stale
which
is
a
frequent
problem
with
european
imports
secondly
im
sure
it
helps
that
ive
just
arrived
home
from
cycling
back
from
work
on
a
warm
summer
day
anyway
after
having
caught
my
breath
i
can
smell
the
grainy
aroma
with
some
spicyherbalgrassy
hops
and
a
hint
of
corniness
about
how
id
expect
a
czech
pils
to
smell
the
flavor
is
clean
and
malty
with
a
brisk
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
and
a
mildly
tart
yogurtlike
tangy
aftertaste
all
in
all
ive
had
better
czech
pilseners
but
this
one
is
drinkable
especially
if
youve
gotten
yourself
all
hot
and
thirsty
first
ill
be
having
another
soon
im
sure
overall
its
a
classic
bohemian
pilsner
a
little
bit
sharper
than
the
average
definitely
a
good
example
of
a
czech
pilsner
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
rich
golden
color
with
a
fairly
dense
foamy
white
head
mildly
sweet
malt
aromas
balanced
by
a
mildly
flowery
hop
presence
clean
pale
malt
palette
with
bread
flavors
and
a
slightly
grassy
finish
begins
with
a
soft
hoppy
aroma
which
returns
and
mellows
at
the
finish
pleasantly
watery
mouthfeel
fuller
like
tap
water
rather
than
overly
crisp
filtered
water
very
drinkable
though
i
only
have
one
for
an
inexpensive
imported
pilsener
this
one
is
richer
in
flavor
and
aroma
than
urquell
wellbalanced
but
without
the
crispness
and
subtle
hop
bite
im
actually
fairly
impressed
with
this
stuff
not
bad
at
all
d
excellent
if
a
bit
boring
i
could
drink
a
few
more
of
these
this
spring
im
not
the
biggest
pils
fan
but
this
is
excellent
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
finish
has
more
bitterness
than
the
nose
lead
me
to
believe
and
really
helps
the
flavor
profile
worth
a
try
well
its
refreshing
so
could
fit
with
the
hotday
category
but
there
are
so
many
of
those
this
fits
in
with
the
boring
though
not
bad
euro
lager
category

the

is

the

with

the

its
pretty

i
would
say
go
for
it
nice

when
served

worth
repeating
much
better
than
some
of
the
other
pilseners
from

regions
bham
uk
di
liked
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
it
again
it
taste
just
like
any
other
pilsner
but
it
refreshes
i
reccomend
drinkability
lets
never
ever
speak
of
this
again
oa
nothing
intresting
at
all
if
you
want
a
very
unoffensive
watery
beer
go
for
this
one
did
i
say
refreshing
mouthfeel
was
impressively
raspy
in
texture
medium
carbonation
present
medium
body
pleasant
all
around
probably
a
less
than
average
beer
per
style
partly
due
to
the
dangerouslynear
skunk
aroma
that
eminates
from
the
bottle
and
into
the
glass
even
with
a
typical
pale
straw
color
and
abundance
of
carbonation
the
beer
lacks
promise
early
and
often
flavors
turn
out
sweet
but
quickly
follow
up
with
a
grainy
bite
lemony
astringency
and
a
watery
body
hop
flavor
does
however
subsite
into
a
grassy
earthy
character
but
never
improves
the
beer
to
good
levels
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
does
not
deliver
for
me
dvery
good
i
drank
this
after
mowing
my
yard
in
the
florida
heat
and
im
very
much
craving
one
or
two
more
its
the
perfect
thing
to
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
its
wellbalanced
wellbrewed
and
loaded
with
enough
character
to
keep
you
from
getting
bored
worth
trying
well
balanced
drop
i
think
my
bottle
is
nearing
its
bestby
i
would
like
to
try
it
nearer
the
source
standard
clear
gold
and
a
nice
head
smell
is
grassygrain
metallic
with
a
vegetableskunkiness
to
it
taste
is
grainy
but
fairly
bland
from
what
you
would
expect
from
the
style
below
average
in
this
crowded
and
poorly
represented
style
i
think
these
beers
need
to
be
sampled
fresh
closer
to
the
brewery
getting
shipped
across
the
atlantic
doesnt
do
much
to
improve
this
style
imo
initial
aroma
of
lemons
and
sweetness
followed
by
a
sweet
tart
taste
but
after
its
down
leaves
an
earthy
biscuity
very
dry
hop
taste
the
overall
taste
was
also
somewhat
on
the
flat
side
due
to
the
low
carbonation
not
a
horrible
czech
beer
but
im
sure
there
are
better
this
is
a
utilitarian
czech
pils
solid
and
worth
trying
however
not
much
stands
out
overall
i
like
czech
pilseners
more
than
most
do
so
i
have
no
problem
with
rating
such
a
beer
so
highly
for
its
style
this
is
world
class
a
pale
brother
of
noble
darkblack
is
smartly
packed
all
this
gold
and
medals
on
the
label
well
royal
brewery
noblesse
oblige
etc
the
product
itself
is
not
a
waanabee
by
all
existing
standards
malty
with
subtle
yeastyfruity
aroma
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
but
with
wellexpressed
hops
and
even
some
tartness
in
the
finish
good
czech
lager
not
the
best
but
by
no
means
not
the
worst
of
them
try
it
some
day
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
tingling
sensation
on
the
tongue
which
makes
this
an
enjoyable
summer
thirst
quencher
overall
a
very
average
beer
worth
a
try
maybe
once
krusovice
imperial
brewed
by
the
very
important
sounding
the
royal
brewery
of
krusovice
is
an
okay
czech
pils
all
things
considered
even
with
a
much
needed
nose
job
it
wouldnt
win
any
beauty
contests
besides
given
all
the
bitterness
miss
congeniality
is
a
long
shot
its
still
a
worthwhile
beer
in
the
aftertaste
again
after
a
good
grassy
hop
there
is
a
comebacking
of
some
maltiness
notes
this
is
not
american
macro
lager
this
is
czech
pilsener
drinkability
drink
it
fast
and
furious
on
a
summer
day
after
an
assload
of
yard
work
and
this
would
be
perfect
that
said
you
can
get
a
halfrack
of
rainier
for
about
7
which
is
probably
quite
a
bit
cheaper
than
the
plane
ticket
to
czechoslovakia
although
if
youre
going
to
go
there
for
this
specific
beer
then
my
admonitions
about
rainier
will
fall
on
deaf
ears
500
ml
can
bought
in
prague
golden
colour
large
thick
head
hoppy
and
fruity
aroma
some
flowers
there
too
flavour
is
pleasantly
balanced
between
the
malts
and
hops
both
elements
are
present
and
plentiful
to
a
much
greater
degree
than
many
other
so
called
pilseners
nice
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
the
flavor
dulls
a
bit
as
it
warms
for
22
krone
a
half
liter
it
can
not
be
beat
while
in
czech
pours
a
slightly
reddish
clear
gold
under
a
white
head
that
maintains
some
body
for
a
little
while
before
dissipating
into
a
thin
film
across
the
top
a
couple
of
spots
of
lace
cling
to
the
side
the
nose
is
weak
theres
some
malt
there
but
really
not
muchenough
the
mouth
is
nicely
carbonated
and
even
the
initial
taste
is
malt
but
the
hops
are
there
from
the
start
giving
a
nice
flowery
bite
in
the
finish
the
amazing
thing
though
is
the
aftertaste
which
kicks
in
a
full
30
seconds
after
the
liquid
goes
down
smooth
bitterness
overwhelms
the
mouth
from
the
throat
up
and
forward
wow
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
i
will
just
get
straight
to
the
point
this
is
an
average
pilsner
a
little
better
than
some
major
companies
like
miller
lite
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
on
a
positive
note
this
beer
is
smooth
and
crisp
beer
drinkers
can
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
hot
sunny
day
for
something
light
and
refreshing
this
is
my
first
czech
style
pilsner
so
take
it
for
what
its
worth
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
well
hopped
czech
pilsner
with
great
color
and
mouth
feel
great
malthops
balance
this
as
been
my
favorite
standard
beer
at
gb
for
a
while
i
enjoy
the
style
in
general
and
this
one
seems
like
a
fairaverage
representation
great
profile
and
balance
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
and
nice
crisp
brew
this
is
one
great
brew
for
the
summer
months
when
sitting
outside
and
enjoying
the
world
overall
an
ok
beer
nice
to
see
what
fresh
well
made
pilsner
tastes
like
hop
character
is
top
notch
and
it
is
a
clean
easy
drinking
beer
with
no
rough
edges
the
verdict
not
bad
my
descriptions
may
not
sound
exciting
but
this
is
pretty
much
what
a
pils
should
be
nothing
above
and
beyond
but
nothing
to
fuss
about
either
just
a
good
solid
beer
o
not
a
big
pilsner
drinker
but
i
didnt
mind
this
one
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
it
though
if
you
try
it
dont
expect
a
world
class
beer
but
its
nothing
bad
overall
great
session
beer
not
tops
in
terms
of
pushing
any
limits
on
brewing
staying
classic
while
breaching
new
frontiers
is
a
hard
act
to
balance
but
gordon
biersch
is
doing
exactly
that
at
the
restaurant
in
miami
smell
is
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
with
cloying
funky
sweetness
on
top
of
light
malts
flavor
follows
the
aroma
with
overly
sweet
flavor
almost
like
artificial
sweetener
in
it
some
hay
and
honey
bleh
drinkable
and
light
but
the
sweetness
makes
it
difficult
to
get
it
all
down
would
not
order
again
but
not
a
terrible
beer
if
you
happen
to
be
eating
there
pours
a
very
nice
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
twofinger
foamy
white
head
with
some
very
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
nice
little
hop
note
the
taste
is
mostly
malty
with
some
hop
notes
medium
body
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
bitter
overall
a
nice
brew
for
a
hot
day
but
would
not
buy
again
o
easy
to
drink
sessionable
summer
beer
nothing
less
and
nothing
more
this
is
ok
but
nothing
special
pretty
average
not
soft
enough
in
the
mouthfeel
or
crisp
enough
this
beer
pours
up
a
light
gold
with
a
small
head
which
has
more
staying
power
than
the
average
porn
star
lacing
is
present
i
really
dont
get
much
from
the
nose
maybe
some
grasses
taste
is
mild
but
decent
it
has
a
smooth
lemony
giving
way
to
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
adequate
carbonation
not
too
shabby
not
world
class
but
very
enjoyable
this
is
our
most
hoppy
beer
hahaha
okay
whatever
it
isnt
hoppy
at
all
but
it
tastes
pretty
good
the
pour
is
clear
and
golden
to
yellow
with
a
gorgeous
white
head
more
than
three
inches
high
foamy
and
lasting
more
lacing
and
retention
than
usually
seen
from
such
a
light
beer
the
nose
is
crisp
as
anything
sure
to
be
satisfying
in
both
winters
coldest
months
and
summers
hottest
there
is
a
lot
of
light
pils
malt
but
its
very
fresh
and
seedy
from
the
field
the
flavor
is
balanced
with
some
sort
of
goldings
hops
on
the
back
end
but
it
isnt
bitter
just
sort
of
tames
the
sweetness
of
otherwise
doughy
malts
finish
is
super
fast
dryer
than
it
should
be
but
very
very
drinkable
the
body
is
light
but
not
watery
and
the
carbonation
is
near
spot
on
bubbly
enough
but
not
laughably
upbeat
this
is
much
much
much
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
when
it
was
given
to
me
by
the
head
brewer
of
the
syracus
facility
who
is
a
legend
by
the
way
overall
a
nice
americanized
version
of
a
central
european
classic
ill
drink
this
again
this
is
a
solid
tasty
pils
i
would
look
for
a
stronger
nuttiness
and
a
little
more
malt
in
the
flavor
in
an
ideal
world
but
i
could
drink
this
all
day
with
its
taste
that
seems
to
be
well
balanced
with
nothing
really
taking
over
i
kind
of
enjoyed
this
beer
that
is
well
outside
my
dark
beers
and
ipas
taste
overall
drinkability
went
well
with
a
meal
crab
cake
sandwich
and
drinkable
enough
i
could
see
myself
having
another
not
a
bad
not
amazing
but
not
bad
not
the
most
flavorful
pilsner
but
much
more
flavor
than
others
ive
had
on
tap
at
the
myrtle
beach
location
served
in
a
pils
glass
was
honey
colored
with
a
small
white
head
smelled
of
pine
and
flowers
and
toast
saaz
hops
are
obvious
when
you
take
a
sip
bitter
spicey
maybe
somewhere
in
there
is
some
sweetness
from
malt
but
i
dont
really
detect
any
just
hops
finishes
very
crisp
and
dry
not
a
huge
fan
of
czech
pils
maybe
is
the
saaz
hops
but
not
a
totally
bad
beer
its
okay
then
again
the
san
jose
locale
also
had
an
export
lager
that
i
tasted
awhile
back
with
a
similar
cooked
cereal
problem
i
hope
its
an
isolated
problem
eric
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
easy
drinking
warm
weather
pilsner
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
good
summertime
thirst
quencher
o
i
think
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
its
refreshing
no
off
flavors
and
the
price
is
perfect
nothing
outstanding
about
it
but
id
pick
it
up
again
to
toss
back
at
parties
worth
a
try
cheers
i
had
this
at
the
brewpub
in
tysons
corner
with
some
delicious
brunch
in
the
early
afternoon
it
pours
golden
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
malty
and
clear
its
a
crisp
brew
with
some
amount
of
hops
and
a
dry
taste
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
too
dry
overall
for
a
pilsner
this
is
damn
good
light
enough
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
full
and
flavorful
enough
to
satisfy
an
ale
aficionado
such
as
myself
overall
a
nice
bohemian
pilsner
best
beer
ive
had
here
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
had
its
nothing
real
exciting
but
thats
to
be
expected
with
the
style
deep
gold
mostly
clear
a
bit
of
chill
haze
clean
malt
bill
in
the
nose
floral
hops
taste
mirrors
nose
pretty
clean
but
a
bit
sweet
mouthfeel
well
on
light
side
of
medium
dry
finish
ok
but
pretty
sweet
for
the
style
part
of
the
mixed
winter
12
pack
i
enjoyed
this
pils
it
had
the
right
amount
of
dryness
to
the
finish
combined
with
a
hoppy
nose
and
solid
mouthfeel
better
than
the
lagers
available
in
maui
konamaui
brewingas
it
had
more
complexity
i
can
get
this
in
bc
and
probably
will
pick
some
up
for
the
summer
overall
i
would
say
a
good
summer
day
beer
this
is
a
rather
average
pilsner
nothing
to
really
set
it
apart
from
the
crowd
highly
drinkable
and
unoffensive
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
too
light
and
lacking
flavor
o
i
am
not
a
pilsner
fan
but
this
one
is
pretty
decent
i
would
not
overlook
this
beer
if
it
was
offered
on
draft
pours
crystalline
yellow
into
a
pilsener
glass
with
an
all
too
short
lived
cloudy
white
head
smells
appetizingly
grassy
with
a
nice
malty
sweet
backbone
taste
is
floral
hops
up
frontid
be
curious
to
see
their
hopping
mixand
sweet
malts
in
the
back
no
particularly
outstanding
notes
to
mention
just
a
nice
approachable
delicously
standard
brew
mouthfeel
is
buttery
carbonated
with
a
crisp
finish
kind
of
a
citrusy
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
two
best
uses
for
this
one
give
it
to
somebody
transitioning
from
micro
to
macro
or
to
a
visiting
german
friend
who
wants
a
little
taste
of
home
only
complaint
i
have
about
this
one
is
the
price
i
went
with
an
aggro
pour
nearly
inverting
the
bottle
at
one
point
just
to
see
what
would
happen
my
glass
filled
rather
quickly
is
what
happened
and
once
the
swirling
agitation
settled
i
had
just
over
a
finger
of
fluffy
eggshell
white
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
golden
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
unbidden
my
uncle
mentioned
croesus
at
thanksgiving
dinner
unbeknownced
that
i
routinely
allude
to
him
and
his
greed
especially
for
gold
nose
smelled
of
grassy
saaz
hops
and
i
knew
that
i
was
in
for
a
good
time
i
love
czech
pilsners
as
my
favorite
style
of
lager
beer
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
of
freshly
mown
grass
near
a
field
of
barley
this
could
be
especially
nice
in
the
summertime
it
makes
me
wonder
if
their
production
facility
has
room
for
a
canning
line
as
i
would
definitely
drink
this
from
a
can
in
my
cooler
finish
was
dry
refreshing
and
a
nice
example
of
a
tasty
pils
overall
i
liked
this
beer
with
the
caveats
mentioned
above
overall
drinkability
unrefreshing
mostly
bland
and
offers
almost
only
offcharacters
in
the
profile
may
be
a
bottle
past
its
prime
because
usually
this
brewery
has
gotten
pretty
good
scores
from
me
dr
drinkable
but
simple
and
of
limited
quality
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
except
maybe
to
have
it
on
draught
o
overall
an
average
pilsener
not
much
in
the
nose
or
the
taste
at
all
but
pretty
easy
to
drink
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
o
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
good
beer
for
a
warm
evening
especially
given
the
price
had
the
czech
pilsner
at
the
g
b
in
bolingbrook
il
last
evening
the
color
was
a
clear
golden
with
white
head
that
laced
slightly
the
aroma
was
common
of
czech
pilsners
grain
hops
etc
the
taste
was
powering
with
grain
and
hops
very
smooth
the
grain
and
malt
was
balanced
nicely
with
hops
and
the
beer
came
off
the
pallet
clean
overall
not
to
bad
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
easy
good
session
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
is
crisp
grainy
some
malts
a
little
bit
bitter
at
the
finish
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
d
overall
im
not
very
crazy
about
this
beer
i
would
pass
if
i
had
another
stab
at
this
probably
not
something
to
brag
about
but
wouldnt
hurt
to
have
if
you
invite
guests
over
who
arent
that
familiar
with
craft
brews
poured
a
clear
strawyellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
aroma
of
palepils
malts
hay
and
light
floral
hops
taste
is
light
with
subdued
pils
malts
and
an
underlying
metallic
sensation
lightly
hopped
weak
but
balanced
at
least
very
light
mouthfeel
somewhat
unpleasant
aftertaste
a
drinkable
beer
for
the
unadventurous
but
just
not
my
style
despite
the
serving
temperature
issue
this
beer
is
still
quite
nice
and
enjoyable
it
seems
that
the
dc
installation
can
brew
a
pretty
good
version
of
this
beer
as
i
am
certainly
enjoying
this
beer
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
would
be
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
more
if
it
had
been
initially
served
at
a
cooler
temperature
even
if
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
anyway
if
you
like
mainstream
commercial
lagers
theres
no
way
you
wont
enjoy
this
if
youre
the
type
who
sorts
through
reviews
on
beer
advocate
chances
are
you
already
know
exactly
how
much
youll
enjoy
this
bottom
line
gordon
biersch
czech
pilsner
is
far
from
the
epitome
of
the
style
but
its
better
than
many
others
on
the
market
and
in
a
pinch
will
do
just
fine
notes
this
is
a
solid
pils
light
to
moderate
in
body
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
not
one
of
my
favorite
brews
of
this
style
but
very
drinkable
nonetheless
definitely
a
good
brew
for
a
long
summer
afternoon
doing
yard
work
if
it
werent
for
the
the
lingering
malty
flavor
i
would
skip
this
brew
i
find
this
interpritation
to
be
similar
to
the
true
style
but
not
enough
to
make
me
a
full
time
gbcsp
drinker
overall
a
fairly
standard
czech
pils
worthy
to
have
as
a
stand
by
on
a
hot
day
served
in
pilsner
glass
this
brew
had
a
2
finger
clean
white
head
with
noticeable
carbonation
settling
into
a
thin
white
cap
the
aroma
was
doughy
and
had
a
nice
what
aroma
with
a
slight
hop
presence
the
taste
was
clean
and
crisp
which
is
what
i
like
and
expect
in
a
czech
pilsner
the
light
body
and
clean
malt
taste
was
finished
with
a
moderate
hop
flavor
that
was
very
delicious
this
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
the
better
of
the
two
brews
i
had
at
the
location
i
visited
overall
a
good
well
constructed
fresh
affordable
pilsner
style
beer
that
may
lack
some
balance
but
overall
is
satisfying
fairly
solid
classic
soft
malt
bodied
with
just
enough
noble
hops
d
nothing
impressive
cant
say
i
would
drink
this
again
didnt
even
finish
it
drinkability
a
sessionable
beer
but
not
tops
for
the
stye
the
store
i
bought
this
at
appears
to
have
kept
it
in
the
fridge
the
whole
time
but
how
many
people
on
the
east
coast
have
heard
of
gordon
biersch
aside
from
probably
loss
of
spice
in
the
hop
profile
id
like
to
believe
i
caught
this
on
the
tail
end
of
its
quality
window
pretty
decent
definitely
tastes
like
a
faithful
take
on
a
bohemian
pilsner
d
quite
drinkable
sessionworthy
d
session
probably
good
with
most
anything
where
pils
would
work
plus
maybe
with
some
roasted
meats
as
well
out
comes
a
beautifullooking
pilsner
with
a
big
head
and
a
crystalclear
golden
hue
herbal
floral
and
spicy
hops
aroma
meets
the
dried
haylike
malt
the
fluffy
and
crisp
lighttomedium
body
contains
delicate
hopping
with
a
long
drawn
out
floral
flavor
the
maltiness
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
with
bread
and
grassy
tones
the
hop
bit
terness
shows
some
sharpness
and
spice
to
balance
this
brew
an
excellent
go
at
the
style
with
a
bit
more
body
and
less
crispness
than
expected
still
so
very
drinkable
overall
if
your
at
the
restaurant
this
beer
wasnt
bad
but
again
wasnt
the
bed
pilsner
in
the
world
but
was
still
a
descent
beer
choice
worth
a
try
very
pale
yellow
clear
colored
beer
it
has
a
pretty
clumpy
head
with
some
decent
lacing
very
few
carbonation
bubbles
after
about
1
minute
past
opening
it
has
a
clear
bready
smell
it
is
very
mild
though
and
hard
to
pick
up
unless
you
are
almost
touching
it
taste
is
like
most
pilseners
some
more
eccentric
hops
at
work
here
not
just
traditional
pils
hops
im
having
trouble
picking
it
out
its
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
id
say
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
the
beer
id
order
if
i
wanted
a
pils
i
could
drink
these
all
summers

it
is
nice

d
nothing

definitely
get
this

really
great
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style

should
be
more
appreciated
by
the
ba
community
in
general
its
the
exact
opposite
of
barrel
aged
but
somehow
when
a
brewery
nails
this
style
it
feels
somehow
innovative
a

i
would
happily
drink
again
and
again

tall

frumpy

mostly
honeyish
flavors
are
straightforward
honeyish
pilsner
malts
with
a
leafy
hoppiness
that
comes
through
on
the
midpalate
and
finish
overall
a
beautiful
beer
to
look
at
whose
taste
is
not
bad
at
all
not
my
favorite
of
their
lineup
but
passable
dont
drink
and
review
d
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
czech
pils
it
is
spicy
and
sessionable
golden
color
medium
cloudiness
more
body
than
any
other
czech
pils
that
i
have
loved
before
but
decent
amount
of
malty
sweetness
with
ample
lace
around
the
glassware
finishs
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
generous
malt
back
pretty
well
balanced
between
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
hop
bitterness
but
not
what
i
am
used
to
as
being
a
czech
pilsner
drinkability
a
solid
pils
with
a
strong
hop
presence
would
pair
well
with
spicy
foods
d
their
czech
pilsner
is
pretty
easily
drinkable
but
there
isnt
much
there
a
decent
offering
that
leans
towards
being
pretty
capable
but
just
doesnt
quite
make
it
d
a
very
nice
summer
session
beer
overall
comes
across
very
similar
to
golden
export
at
first
but
czech
lager
is
definitely
not
as
good
same
old
song
the
nose
had
a
little
more
going
but
overall
another
bland
attempt
medium
body
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
crisp
dry
finish
overall
aroma
was
lacking
but
the
taste
was
decent
and
it
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
succession
really
refreshing
on
a
hot
night
hoppier
and
stiffer
than
some
bohemian
pilsners
very
nice
buy
again
no
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
thick
white
finebubbled
head
aroma
is
strong
malty
and
slightly
fruity
flavor
is
malty
and
pleasant
but
a
little
watery
texture
is
smooth
and
a
bit
thin
too
bad
i
do
tend
to
discriminate
against
pilsners
but
this
one
failed
to
impress
me
drinkability
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
without
that
added
zing
of
crispness
it
made
for
a
subpar
hohum
pilsner
pity
clean
and
golden
colored
not
a
lot
of
head
or
carbonation
mild
malty
aroma
malty
flavor
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
has
an
almost
straw
like
flavor
to
it
the
hop
bitterness
tends
to
linger
in
the
finish
decent
bodyfairly
dry
and
quenching
an
ok
beer
overall
my
first
beer
from
gordon
bierschhave
wanted
to
try
a
brewpub
of
theirs
for
ages
i
bet
it
would
be
an
improvement
on
draft
drinkability
ok
i
would
drink
it
if
theres
nothing
else
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
overall
not
a
bad
drink
but
perhaps
not
my
favorite
style
also
this
might
be
better
described
as
a
germanstyle
pilsener
and
not
czech
bohemian
from
my
understanding
though
gb
makes
beers
very
well
in
the
german
style
and
have
even
imported
many
of
their
yeast
strains
from
germany
certainly
will
not
seek
out
but
whats
funny
is
as
i
have
been
writing
this
review
its
already
starting
to
taste
better
this
is
a
bohemianstyle
pilsner
with
a
nice
golden
hue
to
it
it
came
across
as
medium
bodied
and
it
was
accented
with
a
spicy
hop
character
apparently
the
hops
are
imported
from
the
czech
republic
usually
im
not
a
big
fan
of
czech
hops
but
this
beer
came
across
as
pretty
decent
it
is
certainly
worth
trying
drinkability
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
but
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
too
drinkability
perfect
beer
for
hot
and
humid
day
in
myrtle
beach
must
try
this
one
overall
i
hope
this
was
just
a
bad
batch
but
chances
are
i
wont
be
visiting
again
anytime
soon
to
see
for
myself
eh
not
my
thing
i
guess
the
beer
didnt
really
have
any
kind
of
hop
presence
even
the
slightest
bit
more
wouldve
made
a
huge
difference
the
gordon
biersch
beer
menu
doesnt
offer
much
excitement
in
my
opinion
this
is
about
the
best
youre
going
to
get
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
immensely
probably
helped
by
my
strong
need
for
a
thirstquenching
beverage
it
had
pretty
good
flavor
and
didnt
impart
a
buzz
which
suited
the
bill
perfectly
the
flavor
was
a
little
weak
though
so
if
i
were
drinking
more
than
one
id
probably
move
on
to
something
else
drinkability
may
go
well
with
a
meal
has
a
decent
flavor
but
not
en
masse
not
my
favorite
beer
or
even
in
my
top
500
but
it
is
a
decent
check
pilsner
overall
nothing
amazing
a
good
pilsner
it
was
priced
well
too
at
6
96
a
sixer
i
may
go
back
to
this
if
i
want
a
decent
czech
pilsner
and
dont
want
to
pay
for
pilsner
urquell
or
sn
summerfest
czech
style
pilsners
a
pretty
decent
beer
from
gordon
biersch
im
often
disappointed
in
their
beer
but
this
one
isnt
bad
at
all
its
a
more
than
decent
czech
pilsner
that
doesnt
deviate
from
the
usual
bells
and
whistles
of
the
style
its
honestly
a
bit
better
than
i
expected
obviously
i
had
pretty
low
expectations
ultimately
it
lacks
a
little
in
the
depth
department
but
thats
somewhat
typical
for
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
worth
checking
out
if
you
run
across
it
beer
poured
golden
with
a
decent
white
head
that
is
hanging
around
nose
is
somewhat
malty
with
no
other
distinguishable
characteristics
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
biscuity
malt
backbone
blends
pretty
nicely
into
a
crisp
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
crisp
clean
refreshing
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
mowing
the
lawn
shimmering
gold
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
aroma
is
light
fruits
with
pale
malts
and
spicy
hops
flavor
is
sweet
malts
overly
sweet
for
the
style
some
light
but
spicy
hops
and
a
metallic
mealy
malt
finish
watery
body
with
high
carbonation
pretty
boring
for
a
light
beer
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
and
this
is
a
definite
session
beer
bottle
dated

what
a
nice
find
at
gb
when
i
was
there
for
the
stickie
alt
this
beer
pours
a
medium
gold
color
with
a
beautiful
thick
white
head
wonderful
hop
aroma
fresh
cut
grass
medium
body
and
taste
that
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
light
hint
of
malt
and
good
hop
bite
beer
finishes
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
good
for
this
beer
and
it
makes
me
want
to
have
a
few
more
very
solid
beer
d
an
ok
beer
that
suffers
from
being
a
bit
too
dry
not
terible
though
and
certainly
paired
well
with
food
the
third
in
the
line
from
the
6x
sampler
at
the
rockville
restaurant
bright
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
very
nice
foamy
head
that
laced
the
glass
all
the
way
down
soft
bubbles
race
up
the
sides
this
one
was
the
surprise
of
the
bunch
your
typical
imported
czech
pils
is
refreshing
and
drinkable
yes
but
often
accompanied
by
an
annoying
i
call
it
import
lager
cardboard
aftertaste
that
makes
the
finished
product
less
than
perfect
my
worldtraveler
kids
have
told
me
that
even
stella
artois
on
tap
in
country
is
quite
good
so
i
was
pleased
when
i
raised
this
one
to
my
lips
and
found
a
very
clean
refreshing
and
fresh
taste
extremely
well
balanced
clear
malt
flavor
and
a
nice
fruity
hops
bite
that
is
so
well
done
that
i
found
myself
wishing
i
could
have
a
whole
glass
of
it
i
am
not
necessarily
a
czech
pilsner
fan
nor
a
hops
head
but
this
one
really
won
me
over
would
have
been
great
with
the
food
probably
my
favorite
offering
from
the
virginia
beach
gordon
biersch
solid
white
head
atop
my
glass
of
bright
golden
slight
hazed
czech
style
pils
nose
was
packed
ull
of
saaz
and
herbal
grassy
lemon
zest
notes
biscuit
malts
with
subtle
sweetness
coming
through
flavors
was
all
around
solid
not
the
best
but
well
made
and
easy
to
consume
enought
bitterness
with
the
saaz
flowing
the
herbal
hops
and
lemongras
blend
is
great
with
the
mild
biscuit
layers
of
sweetness
i
could
drink
this
in
session
no
problem
very
smooth
balanced
brew
that
makes
you
appreciate
a
good
lager
mouthfeel
is
sturdy
carbonatino
but
not
overdone
naturally
produced
and
served
from
the
serving
tanks
drinkability
would
have
been
more
than
a
few
half
liters
but
i
was
able
to
make
it
back
to
the
hotel
room
to
watch
the
penns
and
red
wings
battle
it
out
with
an
amazing
back
and
forth
penguins
victory
while
drinking
sierra
nevada
summer
another
tasty
pils
overall
good
solid
lager
clean
and
crisp
a
good
beer
to
start
off
the
night
with
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
washington
dc
location
saaz
hop
bitterness
not
quite
near
metallic
medium
yellow
a
caesar
crown
of
white
and
lace
medium
mouthfeel
off
bitterness
that
makes
it
not
all
that
drinkable
underaverage
beer
but
hey
you
need
a
pilsner
in
a
standard
lineup
d
the
nice
subtle
kolsh
flavors
of
sweet
sulfur
like
licorice
hints
are
overpowered
by
bitterness
and
start
masking
all
the
other
flavors
this
somewhat
nondescript
european
lager
is
a
fine
and
tasty
beer
that
went
very
well
with
the
grilled
chicken
salad
but
pushing
this
beer
into
a
better
celebration
of
german
noble
hops
would
have
given
a
crispness
to
the
beer
that
suits
more
of
the
beers
nuances
much
better
than
the
deliniation
of
czech
pils
a
seethru
pale
gold
body
with
some
nice
head
like
any
pilsner
its
taste
relies
on
its
hops
and
this
beer
is
alright
think
pils
urquell
basically
the
hops
are
there
with
no
real
balance
or
mixing
a
slick
passing
over
the
tongue
with
some
hop
backbite
is
how
i
would
describe
this
beer
and
not
really
seperated
from
other
pils
di
moved
on
after
one
overall
nice
tasting
beer
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
ever
consumed
in
an
airport
fresh
from
the
tap
pours
an
unclouded
gold
bright
white
creamy
head
piles
high
on
the
body
lacing
provides
a
tight
skirt
to
cove
the
glass
nose
sweet
with
malt
citrus
like
in
its
crispness
start
has
a
pleasing
malt
presence
the
hops
delectable
with
their
spicy
bitterness
at
the
back
top
is
moderate
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
the
customary
acidity
the
hops
understated
but
pleasingly
spicy
quite
dry
aftertaste
a
nice
drinking
beer
good
session
beer
drank
a
halfpint
of
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
2007
north
market
microbrew
fest
the
brewer
himself
was
there
and
this
is
what
he
recommended
from
their
selection
pours
a
clear
bright
yellowishgold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
pretty
good
retention
taste
and
smell
were
clean
and
crisp
like
a
nice
pilsener
nothing
remarkable
balanced
between
a
medium
maltiness
and
a
little
hoppiness
again
nothing
stands
out
sharp
mouthfeel
almost
bitey
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
when
its
a
little
colder
its
nice
and
refreshing
but
anyone
looking
for
real
complexity
should
look
elsewhere
this
beer
had
a
pretty
authentic
euroflavor
pretty
light
but
with
a
kick
recommended
the
mouth
is
a
solid
3
the
drinkabilty
is
decent
may
be
better
on
a
very
hot
day
not
a
bad
crossover
beer
this
was
poured
very
nicely
into
a
gb
becker
raising
an
off
white
two
finger
head
over
a
translucent
hazy
bright
gold
body
the
head
falls
quickly
though
to
a
glass
ring
neads
longer
head
retention
and
better
clarity
the
nose
is
almost
nothing
to
speak
of
just
a
little
malt
not
bad
just
not
there
taste
is
a
bit
better
with
nice
edelhopfen
cleanliness
but
i
feel
that
they
didnt
stick
to
just
noble
hops
its
pretty
dry
not
as
balanced
as
it
could
be
i
dont
think
the
malts
used
are
not
up
to
snuff
either
mouthfeel
is
just
what
i
expect
though
not
sublime
a
nice
drinker
but
missing
some
points
and
thus
average
this
presents
a
clear
golden
color
with
maybe
a
hint
of
orange
nice
frothy
white
head
sits
on
top
and
lingers
for
a
while
leaving
a
few
spots
of
lace
not
much
aroma
from
the
pale
malt
however
there
is
a
good
amount
of
floral
spicy
and
a
bit
grassy
hops
the
malt
character
is
slightly
sweet
and
dry
plae
and
goes
well
with
the
spicy
flowery
hop
flavor
very
clean
and
crisp
the
hop
bitterness
seems
almost
perfect
in
this
czech
lagers
are
best
fresh
and
this
really
shows
why
light
body
with
a
refreshing
amount
of
carbonation
very
solid
golden
copper
color
in
the
glass
big
white
head
some
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
lagery
clean
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
the
big
surprise
here
more
hops
than
i
expected
in
a
pilsener
more
like
apa
levels
here
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
more
subdued
like
youd
expect
in
the
style
light
mouthfeel
finishes
well
on
a
dry
hoppy
note
drinkable
presented
as
a
bright
golden
color
with
mioderate
white
puffy
head
smell
is
very
spicy
and
hoppy
taste
is
very
enjoyable
with
a
strong
crispness
and
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
very
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
nice
mouhtfeel
very
flavorful
nice
surprising
beer
brought
to
the
table
a
lovely
strawcolor
with
a
finger
of
bubbly
head
smelled
of
hops
and
spices
cloves
maybe
hops
and
spices
assault
the
tongue
on
light
malty
undertones
definetely
saaz
hops
overly
bitter
aftertaste
takes
away
from
the
good
inital
impression
good
pilsner
but
nothing
special
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
a
little
too
hoppy
and
spicy
for
my
likings
in
a
pilsner
but
overall
above
average
i
hed
this
at
the
columbus
oh
location
great
beer
not
czechvar
but
close
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
hops
saaz
and
malt
are
balanced
just
right
for
this
style
i
was
told
by
the
manager
that
this
beer
was
going
on
tap
year
round
not
just
a
seasonal

this
is

that

far

a

maybe

pretty

good
o
it
is
a
pilsner
which
makes
it
okay
by
me
but
never
a
beer
i
just
jump
up
and
down
for
having
said
that
though
it
was
refreshing
and
enjoyable
o
its
an
alright
pilsner
its
got
quite
a
bitter
bite
which
makes
it
real
crisp
against
the
grains
in
here
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
pilsner
but
still
worth
picking
up
for
an
afternoon
on

the

is
a
solid
offering
from

the

poured
a
clear
crisp

thin

overall
seems
like
a
pretty
bang
on
example
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
hop
bite
but
solid
nonetheless
o
its
great
for
the
style
its
better
than
some
pilsners
made
in
cz
i
would
recommend
this
for
anyone
wishing
to
try
a
pilsner
for
the
first
time
very
easy
to
drink
o
after
passing
over
it
a
few
times
im
glad
that
i
finally
picked
one
up
o
it
is
a
fine
tasting
refreshing
lager
easily
beyond
your
bmc
its
a
little
sweeter
and
more
complex
but
i
think
its
missing
that
transition
to
bitter
andor
dry
o
a
really
tasty
pilsner
a
nonetoo
shabby
go
at
the
czech
pilsener
they
nailed
the
crispness
in
malt
and
in
hops
but
the
flavours
seem
too
muddled
and
indistinct
to
have
it
run
with
the
bohemian
greats
be
they
old
word
or
not
a
czech
pils
all
the
same
but
aside
from
a
confusing
aromatic
experience
one
can
get
intune
with
this
great
divide
seasonal
a
strange
choice
for
a
colder
season
brew
but
it
has
its
charm
if
you
have
the
patience
to
discover
it
for
yourself
overall
im
on
the
pilslager
stint
until
gabf
and
was
looking
longingly
at
a
few
hoppy
brews
i
had
in
the
fridge
this
satisfied
my
longing
but
at
the
same
time
it
just
seems
a
bit
overly
hoppy
for
a
traditional
pils
but
on
the
same
hand
it
is
a
good
american
twist
i
could
see
grabbing
a
six
pack
of
this
and
having
a
few
around
the
fire
on
a
muggy
night
during
a
camp
out
it
was
good
just
prepare
for
quite
a
hoppy
pils
overall
a
tasty
pils
o
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pilsner
but
its
nothing
spectacular
would
definitely
like
it
to
be
a
bit
more
crisp
and
refreshing
for
hot
summer
days
but
otherwise
its
pretty
good
not
worth
the
price
at
2
50
a
single
though
o
a
very
good
pilsner
one
of
the
better
light
pilsners
i
have
come
across
probably
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
really
really
enjoy
this
beer
nicely
balanced
and
light
enough
to
have
a
few
but
not
so
light
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
i
would
totally
get
this
again
o
a
great
beer
im
not
a
pilsener
drinker
regularly
but
a
beer
like
this
is
the
kind
that
makes
you
appreciate
a
style
real
bright
and
crisp
with
the
grains
accentuated
nicely
by
the
hops
i
toned
down
some
of
my
scores
out
of
deference
to
my
lack
of
experience
with
the
style
because
i
was
ready
to
assign
some
pretty
glowing
values
i
can
certainly
say
this
no
reason
not
to
grab
some
if
you
see
em
on
the
shelf
o
a
good
attempt
at
a
style
that
is
very
tough
to
perfect
its
very
drinkable
but
not
quite
as
elegant
and
refined
as
it
needs
to
be
to
go
toe
to
toe
with
the
best
in
the
category
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
if
i
could
get
this
in
georgia
this
would
probably
be
one
of
my
go
to
pils
this
might
be
the
best
great
divide
beer
that
i
have
had
to
date
o
easy
to
drink
and
just
on
the
cusp
of
being
sessionable
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
interesting
with
the
slightly
more
hoppy
flavors
and
enough
complexity
i
know
when
i
think
pilsner
i
think
the
desert
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
grass
very
light
white
grape
skin
and
some
light
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
heavier
flowers
and
a
touch
of
sulfur
in
the
background
and
in
the
finish
reminds
me
almost
of
a
burtonish
character
the
body
straddles
the
line
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
solid
pils
not
the
best
the
states
have
put
forth
but
a
nice
one
regardless
o
a
fairly
runofthemill
czech
pilsner
solid
but
nothing
special
o
nothing
spectacular
but
a
nice
pilsner
that
works
really
well
in
the
spring
enjoyable
i
really
liked
the
spiciness
to
it
onice
light
and
refreshing
pretty
solid
brew
for
the
style
o
i
liked
this
beer
because
it
wasnt
bland
or
boring
and
imparted
lots
of
complex
aromas
and
flavors
from
the
hops
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
so
far
one
of
my
favorite
american
versions
of
a
pilsner
a
really
wonderful
job
fresh
lager
is
a
good
thing
and
being
just
2
months
from
being
bottled
you
can
tell
it
tastes
fresh
its
not
big
in
flavor
like
titan
ipa
this
is
a
relaxed
easy
to
approach
pilsner
a
netural
cracker
and
floral
note
hit
first
dry
cracker
and
a
little
grass
midway
finished
with
an
herbal
and
pleasant
bitterness
its
light
bodied
with
a
pleasant
crisp
body
gulp
im
done
thatll
hydrate
me
i
like
overall
a
pretty
solid
pilsener
its
what
you
expect
from
the
style
solid
balance
it
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
typical
of
the
style
meant
to
be
a
session
beer
this
would
be
great
to
pound
at
a
party
or
on
the
deck
over
the
summer
and
what
it
lacks
in
the
flavor
that
youd
expect
from
great
divide
it
makes
up
with
drinkability
i
enjoyed
it
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
a
6
pack
of
it
i
will
grab
one
if
its
in
the
cooler
though
d
its
alright
i
would
not
recommend
it
as
a
pilsner
though
there
are
many
better
versions
typically
i
find
you
cant
go
wrong
with
great
divide
in
this
case
i
would
recommend
against
this
brew
all
in
all
this
is
still
quite
good
and
i
would
be
proud
to
have
brewed
it
however
my
experience
of
great
divide
has
never
been
anything
less
than
stellar
so
i
was
hoping
for
a
world
class
pils
this
doesnt
strike
me
as
world
class
which
would
be
a
feat
indeed
but
it
is
altogether
worthy
of
the
glass
of
any
beer
advocate
this
was
very
disappointing
it
was
far
too
sweet
and
showed
many
flaws
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
coupled
with
the
poor
flavor
it
greatly
brought
down
the
drinkability
i
definitely
wont
be
picking
this
up
again
overall
tastes
more
like
a
standard
euro
pale
lager
than
a
specifically
bohemian
pilsner
could
use
a
breadier
malt
body
decent
not
great
a
prominent
offwhite
head
results
from
a
furious
of
bubbles
retention
is
excellent
color
is
a
pure
and
clear
yelloworange
smells
of
dry
hay
crisp
and
sharp
but
with
a
little
must
where
some
water
leaked
through
the
barn
roof
subtle
light
fruits
are
smelled
in
the
distance
tastes
of
fruit
and
straw
with
a
grainy
backbone
smooth
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
well
dry
and
light
bodied
what
we
have
here
is
a
good
standard
lager
o
a
mineral
and
chalk
taste
is
not
my
favorite
so
this
is
a
bit
of
a
drawback
for
me
other
elements
of
the
beer
are
good
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
othis
brew
is
a
pretty
simple
example
of
the
style
flavors
are
not
terribly
complicated
or
intense
and
the
whole
package
was
a
little
roughhewn
but
this
was
not
a
bad
sessiontype
beer
i
say
session
type
because
the
abv
is
above
5
a
few
more
hops
would
have
helped
balance
the
crackerbiscuit
malts
in
this
brew
but
if
youre
looking
for
an
easydrinking
pils
to
quaff
during
the
game
this
is
not
a
bad
option
o
decent
flavor
above
average
regards
just
lacks
the
grainy
pilsner
character
more
like
a
american
blonde
body
needs
that
more
disticnt
grainy
feel
and
taste
decent
drinkability
tart
lemon
nature
retried
it
in
boston
on
tap
this
time
closer
to
style
but
theres
more
skunkiness
to
the
smell
do
this
beer
presents
sensory
qualities
in
heaps
some
good
and
a
few
questionable
its
pilsner
core
is
solidly
constructed
around
light
malt
qualities
that
do
not
disappoint
it
appears
to
be
a
better
version
of
a
bavarian
pilsner
with
a
hops
edge
that
seems
a
little
blunted
still
it
is
one
of
great
divides
better
stylistic
examples
aside
from
basic
yeti
overall
not
great
but
still
fine
quaffable
and
reasonably
balanced
fans
of
sons
of
anarchy
may
remember
that
being
a
nomad
is
not
the
way
to
go
in
that
subculture
but
a
pilsener
on
a
hot
summers
day
may
be
just
the
ticket
color
me
wandering
but
not
lost
i
lost
no
time
in
popping
the
cap
and
getting
it
into
a
glass
soon
i
had
twoplus
fingers
of
solid
bonewhite

with
good
retention
that
resembled
the

now
this
was
what
i
was
looking
for
mouthfeel
was
soft
not
an
overabundance
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
and
the
taste
was
a
good
commingling
of
the
grassiness
of
the
hops
with
the
counterbalance
of
the
malt
finish
was
semidry
refreshing
and
very
welcomed

with
a

this

ive
ever
had
will
buy
again
and
recommend
nothing
really
jumps
out
and
says
drink
more
of
this
beer
so
i
think
ill
have
to
pass
on

it

this
is
a
very
well
made
pilsneri
like
the
hoppy
nose
and
firm
bready

flavors
kind
of
an
odd
winter
seasonal
because
this
is
something
i
would
wanna
drink
while
grilling
or
just
hanging
around
outside
overall
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
recommend
if
you
can
get
it
could
see
this
going
down
nice
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
texas
summer
day
available
here
in

or

maybe
occasional

a
nice
stab
at
the

here
overall
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
id
easy
have
another
this
is
a
really
nice
and
refreshing
pilsener
a
little
cleaner
than
some
of
the
other
samples
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
this
could
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
your
lager
loving
friends
and
family
its
straightforward
but
done
quite
well
beer
is
medium
to
light

a
little
sweet
and
grain
on
the
finish
a
mild
bitterness
and

presence
it
is
ok
but
not
great
i
do
enjoy
it
though
i
may
have
it
again
nomad
is
a
pretty
decent
czech
pilsner
the
only
slight
change
id
suggest
is
to
tone
down
the
spiciness
a
little
it
is
quite
intense
and
seems
to
mask
or
overpower
some
of
the
other
flavors
pilsner
malt
yeast
and
hops
primarily
it
would
probably
be
a
little
more
enjoyable
if
those
other
elements
were
given
more
room
to
shine
still
a
pretty
good
beer
though
worth
checking
out
o
nothing
overly
groundbreaking
here
but
still
a
simple
enjoyable
pilsner
overall
not
a
bad
summer
beer
but
there
is
a
bitterness
in
there
that
sticks
to
you
after
a
few
beers
not
a
great
session
brew
not
real
exciting
to
look
at
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
finger
of
white
head
if
you
force
it
beading
is
decent
nose
is
pretty
clean
some
soft
sweet
malts
sort
of
a
stale
hop
presence
the
taste
is
pretty
much
all
malt
with
some
abstractly
bitter
hops
light
caramel
some
cereal
hops
catch
up
in
the
end
with
some
herbal
earl
gray
not
too
bad
easy
to
drink
quite
unexciting
though
fresh
hoppiness
up
front
with
light
malts
roasted
almonds
herbal
hops
flavor
leafy
and
a
smooth
back
end
on
the
palate
its
overhopped
for
the
style
lending
a
prominent
bitterness
earthy
and
lemony
with
some
zest
with
not
enough
of
a
hop
flavor
the
midpalate
has
the
malt
profile
not
as
doughy
as
the
nose
would
suggest
the
overhopped
nature
doesnt
help
either
a
touch
of
sweetness
mildly
cornlike
right
before
the
strong
bitter
finish
light
in
body
with
crisp
carbonation
this
is
quite
refreshing
on
the
palate
the
flaws
of
the
nose
arent
as
apparent
on
the
palate
with
the
metallic
character
not
quite
noticeable
not
quite
true
to
style
too
crisp
too
hopped
this
is
still
quite
enjoyable
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
again
decent
pils
with
good
flavorattractive
set
up
with
the
malt
bill
though
hop
presence
could
be
tightened
up
some
not
sure
what
that
metallic
taste
is
on
the
finish
but
it
does
fade
rather
quickly
overall
this
is
a
really
really
good
pils
for
this
being
3
months
old
the
hop
bite
is
still
excellent
for
the
style
i
will
have
to
find
this
for
the
first
of
the
season
tailgate
when
it
is
105
degrees
time
to
try
gds
nomad
pils
poured
from
bottle
dated

beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
bubbly
head
good
retention
and
lacing
looks
inviting
the
nose
is
a
blend
of
pilsner
malt
earthy
hops
and
a
bit
floral
the
flavor
builds
on
the
nose
for
a
nice
flavor
pilsner
malt
base
from
which
the
earthy
hops
lay
a
mild
bitterness
lemon
and
honey
sweetness
provide
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
balance
very
nice
finishes
with
a
mild
bitterness
and
lingering
lemon
sweetness
better
than
anticipated
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
treat
if
a
surpise
not
my
favorite
style
though
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
from
brewery
that
i
think
could
do
better
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
recommended
overall
a
very
fulfilling
pilsner
to
me
loved
this
one
quite
much
a
nice
aggressive
pilsner
with
just
a
slightly
rough
edge
to
it
plenty
bitter
with
grass
citrus
pith
and
lemon
zest
hop
flavors
that
hit
the
palate
dead
on
malt
is
lean
letting
the
hops
shine
properly
dry
which
is
critical
another
good
effort
by
great
divide
c
great
pils
i
hope
i
can
find
this
fresher
but
this
2
month
old
pils
is
damn
tasty
easy
to
session
on
o
very
enjoyable
if
you
dig
earthy
and
natural
tasting
beers
then
this
is
a
good
choice
d
i
think
this
is
a
very
well
executed
pils
that
while
being
a
tad
green
is
very
balanced
supreme
american
flair

but
not
unpleasant
taste
is
bitter
spicy
hops
and
grainy
malt
nice

typical
of
a
good
pilsener
back

i
discovered

i
wouldve
loved
this

very
good
for

yeah
definitely
know
how
to
do
it
and
though
this
is
my
least
favorite
great
divide
eurostyle
beer
so
far
etc
spicy
yeast
and
doughy
malt
also
add
a
bit
of
backbone
to
this
very
crisp
lager
the
hop
profile
is
definitely
on
the
bitter
side

but
feels
more
like
a
german
one
interesting
take
overall
awesome
beer
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
but
i
suspect
this
isnt
a
great
one
doesnt
impress
in
any
way
but
has
a
certain
balance
that
makes
you
want
more
a
maltier
option
to
pilsner
urquell
from
the
same
brewery
a
decent
czech
pilsener
although
certainly
not
the
best
the
country
has
to
offer
it
was
enjoyable
without
proving
anything
too
special
coming
through
with
a
mellow
and
wellbalanced
taste
that
made
it
quite
an
easy
beer
to
drink
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
by
far
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
this
past
week
but
not
one
i
would
ever
choose
if
in
europe
or
north
america
brought
a
330ml
can
home
from
recent
trip
to
europe
a
big
foamy
head
rose
to
the
top
of
my
class
the
color
was
a
clear
copper
the
smell
was
definate
saaz
hops
clean
crisp
taste
slight
sweetness
gave
way
to
a
bitter
after
taste
normal
czech
beer
carbonation
as
it
tastes
so
natural
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
nice
czech
pils
no
suprises
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
overall
would
drink
this
if
i
didnt
have
any
much
choice
but
not
drinking
it
again
for
the
sake
of
drinking
it
any
time
soon
o
i
sure
have
widened
my
beer
taste
over
the
year
but
a
great
czech
pils
is
never
wrong
this
is
still
one
of
my
favourites
it
doesnt
get
much
better
for
this
kind
of
money
ill
drink
this
on
its
own
or
with
meats
sausages
or
a
sturdy
sandwich

you

of

thats
not

thing
clear

is

dry

a
typical
easy

czech
pilsener
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
but
a
few
notches
below
pilsner
urquell
d
pretty
drinkable
however
with
its
watery
taste
not
interested
in
this
one
moreover
it
is
hgb
d
over
all
i
like
this
beer
and
i
feel
that
it
is
pretty
drinkable
goes
down
nice
and
easy
d
the
beer
goes
down
rather
smoothly
and
is
quite
sessionable
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
a
rather
neutral
and
clean
lager
does
not
intrude
the
palate
or
food
decent
d
good
beer
with
lower
reputation
than
it
deserves
in
czech
republic
definitely
one
of
my
favourites
pilsners
good
for
hot
summer
time
d
a
czech
that
you
probably
wont
buy
more
than
once
i
will
not
buy
it
again
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
there
are
so
many
others
that
are
better
this
is
the
best
czech
beer
that
i
have
tried
while
in
czech
republic
there
are
actually
several
versions
available
in
the
stores
such
as
regular
premium
and
excellent
i
am
not
sure
what
kind
is
typically
on
tap
but
it
has
the
czech
pilsner
taste
without
the
skunkyness
like
pilner
urquell
i
would
obviously
prefered
to
have
stayed
out
but
at
least
ive
reviewed
a
beer
while
in
prague
even
if
it
is
from
notes
made
while
in
a
hotel
room
listening
to
the
wife
snore
and
wheeeze
d
very
high
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
maybe
because
im
czech
by
heritage
but
i
actually
really
enjoyed
the
taste
very
nice
drinkability
pretty
good
nothing
too
special
something
i
would
try
again
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
i
loved
in
czech
for
6
months
and
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
great
example
of
a
fine
pilsner
its
mush
lighter
than
the
other
czech
beers
and
aerican
seem
to
shose
this
over
others
i
can
not
find
it
anywhere
in
the
us
im
sure
if
it
was
here
it
would
sell
very
well
althogh
i
do
like
it
there
are
better
czech
selections
there
taste
is
malty
with
decoction
caramel
and
maillard
products
in
the
taste
the
yeast
adds
a
light
fruity
taste
strangely
enough
i
pick
up
hints
of
custard
pudding
bitterness
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
good
ah
the
halcyon
days
of
gambrinus
are
long
gone
gone
is
the
refreshingly
crisp
taste
gone
is
the
buzz
whenever
passing
a
gambrinus
bar
gone
is
the
soul
of
this
once
excellent
beer
i
have
been
living
in
the
czech
republic
for
nigh
on
ten
years
and
once
upon
a
time
a
gambac
would
come
with
a
great
frothy
head
that
clung
to
your
nose
and
further
beers
would
be
on
the
way
before
the
first
was
finished
the
last
gambrinus
i
had
though
was
weak
watery
and
hardly
worth
the
effort
such
are
sad
stories
written
review
translated
from
french
4152008
d
did
a
taste
test
with
this
an
urquell
in
a
praha
pub
and
couldnt
tell
them
apart
just
not
a
fan
of
any
bohemian
lagers
i
have
found
but
the
dark
stuff
is
a
different
story
you
can
get
it
in
500
ml
can
along
with
your
hot
dog
for
a
happy
meal
this
beer
goes
down
easy
enough
and
full
of
taste
for
a
long
session
anyway
this
is
a
typical
czech
brew
its
light
in
color
with
a
nice
head
i
had
it
on
tap
as
well
a
bit
darker
than
budweiser
and
urquell
taste
was
a
bit
less
sweeter
than
those
other
two
had
some
crispness
to
it
this
was
one
of
the
better
beers
i
had
over
there
and
since
im
not
a
pilsner
kind
of
guy
i
drank
this
one
a
lot
like
others
have
commented
a
popular
beer
in
the
czech
republic
due
to
good
taste
and
ease
of
drinking
im
sure
that
it
helps
that
its
also
significantly
cheaper
than
pilsner
urquell
both
in
the
bottle
and
on
tap
worth
a
try
but
not
necessarily
worth
making
a
huge
effort
to
seek
out
if
you
come
to
the
czech
republic
youll
probably
drink
it
this
is
what
you
should
hand
a
bud
drinker
to
show
him
there
is
a
better
way
poured
with
huge
head
crystal
clear
body
great
lacing
clean
mouthfeel
epitamy
of
easy
drinking
not
much
at
all
in
terms
of
arom
oh
well
some
light
hop
bitterness
and
sterm
malt
profile
stays
unobtrusive
to
the
smooth
gentle
mouthfeel
would
be
very
interesting
on
cask
i
personally
would
prefer
to
big
brother
pilsner
urquell
a
good
true
czech
pilsner

above
anything
youd
find
domestically
here
in
ontario
enormous

yellow

some

satisfying
lawnmower

nothing
off
just
bland
and
not

passable
aroma
thanks
to
jan
biegaman
d
drinkable
but
a
little
too
malty
for
my
liking
drank
a
ton
of
this
in
prague
had
a
blast
this
beer
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
budweiser
budvar
it
is
a
really
a
great
beer
you
can
drink
twelve
of
these
at
a
bar
and
not
mind
a
bit
a
must
have
it
is
a
simple
pilsner
but
with
a
few
twists
that
make
it
what
it
is
not
hoppy
no
frills
just
good
beer
brought
me
back
to
pilsners
drinkable
if
there
isnt
anything
else
but
in
this
case
water
is
better
you
have
to
be
18
us
citizen
21
to
visit
gambrinus
website
couldnt
find
anything
harmful
there
though
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
thirst
quenching
czechs
which
probably
makes
me
overrate
this
beer
a
little
it
pours
with
a
finger
of
foam
and
has
a
nice
golden
color
there
is
a
strong
bread
aroma
which
i
also
like
some
hops
and
a
little
sourness
the
taste
is
dry
malty
and
bready
with
some
saltiness
in
my
opinion
its
better
than
average
but
not
in
the
premier
league
the
carbonation
is
very
strong
it
is
almost
sharp
it
pours
a
rocky
and
foamy
white
beerhead
settling
rather
fast
to
a
thin
layer
of
medium
bubbles
goldenlight
honeyish
colour
mediumrich
carbonation
the
nose
is
very
softly
malty
with
light
limelike
fruity
hops
and
sodabiscuit
and
doughs
softly
sour
note
on
the
palate
again
a
lot
of
soft
malts
arrive
in
full
force
with
a
light
delicate
hop
flavour
at
the
backno
particular
bitterness
detected
in
the
finish
while
chewy
bready
flavour
is
more
noticeable
towards
the
very
end
its
basically
a
thinbodied
mildflavoured
pilsner
with
a
bit
of
watery
mouthfeel
in
the
end
straightforward
and
much
more
boring
than
pilsner
urquell
albeit
very
thirst
quenching
especially
when
served
on
tap
this
is
a
very
good
wellmade
europils
and
is
very
refreshing
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
draft
st
petersburg
russia
a
bit
more
substance
after
all
the
russian
lagers
ive
been
swilling
good
fluffy
head
that
leaves
a
little
lace
golden
pilsener
color
a
bit
of
extra
sweetness
but
the
european
hop
profile
makes
a
valiant
effort
to
balance
it
still
a
great
pilsner
beer
smell
i
could
pick
up
from
two
feet
away
made
a
good
first
impression
on
me
pours
a
darkish
clear
gold
under
a
firm
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
to
thick
patchy
film
and
leaves
some
spots
of
lace
sweet
grainy
malt
nose
with
a
twinge
of
metalfruit
hops
very
highly
carbonated
and
fairly
light
in
the
mouth
open
features
a
good
strong
malt
backbone
slightly
sweet
and
a
bit
bready
on
top
of
this
superstructure
the
crisp
hoppiness
quickly
establishes
itself
building
in
intensity
until
the
smooth
bitter
finish
the
bite
lingers
well
into
the
aftertaste
yup
its
good
decent
with
a
meal
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
if
i
had
other
beers
around
its
yellow
and
fizzy
just
like
miller
lite
and
offers
no
real
flavor
like
the
reviewers
before
me
said
its
just
empty
flavor
is
grainy
and
nothing
like
other
bohemian
pilsners
i
had
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
seems
overcarbonated
more
complexity
would
add
to
it
but
its
drinkability
and
smooth
bite
let
it
be
an
excellent
accompaniment
to
breadbased
meals
slightly
above
average
but
unfortunately
touted
as
spectacular
im
drinking
this
brew
all
the
time
in
prague
this
major
brew
i
prefer
immensely
to
pilsner
urquell
came
in
a
soccer
ball
themed
can
pours
with
good
head
but
dissolves
quickly
over
time
beer
itself
is
a
quite
spectacular
golden
taste
is
a
typical
pilsner
smooth
but
not
much
flavor
except
for
slight
hoppyness
with
the
carbonation
and
very
little
aftertaste
a
good
standard
pilsner
i
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
searching
for
this
one
when
i
came
back
to
the
states
and
was
extremely
disappointed
to
discover
that
i
couldnt
get
it
here
id
love
to
drink
another
one
of
these
id
even
choose
it
over
a
better
beer
just
to
sample
it
again
guess
ill
have
to
go
back
to
prague
good
beer
tried
this
when
i
was
in
prague
im
not
very
enthusiastic
with
this
beer
and
the
reason
perhaps
is
that
i
compare
it
with
pilsner
urquell
and
the
u
fleku
beer
i
had
when
i
was
in
prague
definitely
not
the
best
czech
republic
has
to
offer
a
tasty
easy
drinking
lager
definitely
a
beer
well
suited
for
16oz
cans
overall
above
average
to
really
good
beer
no
real
flaws
but
could
be
a
better
representation
of
the
style
still
worth
a
try
overall
im
realizing
that
most
hub
beers
are
overly
sweet
mass
appeal
perhaps
the
descriptor
above
says
czech
pilsener
but
i
cannot
discern
any
czech
yeast
flavors
nor
bohemian
malt
flavors
the
crack
glug
came
off
without
a
hitch
and
i
had
a
brief
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
for
my
efforts
color
was
a
paleyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
loads
of
co2
bubbles
in
evidence
nose
had
a
definite
noble
hops
grassiness
and
i
was
anxious
for
a
sip
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
saaz
hops
spiciness
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
light
honeylike
lager
sweetness
finish
was
semidry
with
the
grassiness
of
the
hops
being
the
lingering
flavor
i
am
sure
that
they
mean
planetary
sustainability
but
i
would
find
it
plenty
sustaining
if
i
opened
my
cooler
while
at
the
beach
or
camping
it
is
tough
to
make
a
good
lagerstyle
beer
and
an
even
harder
sell
in
a
can
thanks
to
the
big
boys
so
when
a
worthwhile
one
comes
along
i
try
to
promote
it
o
i
am
a
fan
of
a
good
pilsner
and
this
is
the
best
i
have
had
so
flavorful
refreshing
and
aromatic
lots
of
sweet
malt
character
to
play
off
the
noble
hops
this
beer
just
has
perfect
balance
and
is
the
everything
a
pilsner
should
be
decent
for
a
light
organic
lager
but
generally
not
in
my
favorites
zone
a
fairly
enjoyable
rendition
of
a
style
near
and
dear
to
my
beerguzzling
heart
the
organic
thing
i
can
take
or
leave
sure
but
beyond
that
what
we
have
here
is
one
drinkable
ode
to
true
pils
aficionados
everywhere
not
bad
stuff
great
for
a
warm
day
the
legend
woodychandler
comes
through
with
this

poured

with
a

smell
is
malty
some
grains
slightly
sweet
taste
is
the
same
malts
grains
bit
of
hops
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
from
a
yellow
and
black
pint
can
i
can
see
myself
buying
more
than
1
of
this
beer
wow
very
nice
for
the
style
its
not
inyourface
like
some
other
examples
ultimately
stale
cardboard
flavor
dominated
i
couldnt
tell
you
about
hops
or
the
yeast
profile
any
alleged
crispness
it
was
just
old
cardboard
given
that
hub
is
an
elite
brewery
i
would
try
this
beer
again
i
think
they
just
dumped
old
product
onto
a
beerfest
tended
by
volunteers
rather
than
reps
overall
solid
the
body
was
solid
nicely
clean
and
had
a
pleasant
dry
finish
drinkability
was
good
you
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
guys
overall
a
pleasant
take
on
the
style
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
o
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
example
of
this
style
of
beer
with
just
the
right
blend
of
sessionability
and
character
hub
has
yet
another
winner
here
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
although
it
doesnt
suit
my
taste
well
still
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
palate
opens
moderately
bitter
almost
surprising
in
its
strength
with
a
blend
of
dough
a
faint
diacetyl
and
dusty
and
preserved
lemons
the
midpalate
has
some
honey
and
floral
hop
character
the
bitterness
is
a
little
too
high
for
the
style
imo
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
light
but
having
a
pleasant
fullness
and
moderate
carbonation
that
lends
just
a
touch
of
acidity
to
complement
the
fruitiness
of
the
hops
solid
stuff
i
will
revisit
this

actually
overall
a
very

i
hesitate
to
call
it
a
czech
pilsner
however
this
was
a
real
quality
pilsner
it
was
very
smooth
and
had
a
real
nice
subtle
take
to
it
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
it
takes
a
special
kind
of
american
brewery
to
concoct
a
classic
german
style
as
impeccable
as
this
my
normal
initial
description
of
a
beer
like
this
is
its
a
lager

its
a

for

classic

an
all

rjt
o
yet
another
solid
installment
in
the
pilsener
family
perhaps
not
my
absolute
favorite
but
whereas
some
showcase
more
hops
or
more
bite
this
brew
is
a
fullon
fruity
sweet
version
and
would
be
a
perfect
gateway
beer
to
the
more
bitter
pilseners
of
the
world
good
brew
o
this
one
is
meh
city
not
only
is
it
not
what
i
want
from
the
style
the
cardboard
taste
kills
it
even
further
with
pilsner
urquell
so
readily
available
i
see
absolutely
no
reason
to
return
to
this
o
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
though
not
overly
complex
or
interesting
im
not
sure
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
one
again
but
it
goes
pretty
well
with
spicy
foods
overall
not
bad
nothing
really
ruined
a
hint
of
sulfur
note
but
not
much
if
any
hops
eventually
kick
in
although
not
the
same
bright
hops
i
remember
from
czech
rep
but
decent
malt
profile
and
lager
notes
well
rounded
little
light
on
the
malts
and
body
though
but
still
just
a
step
below
most
of
the
beers
i
had
in
prague
light
refreshing
good
summer
beer
sweet
smell
complements
and
contrasts
well
the
hop
bitterness
taste
really
brings
it
out
not
too
watery
which
is
too
often
a
problem
with
this
style
i
could
finish
a
dozen
fairly
easily
i
dont
understand
the
appearance
rating
category
it
looks
like
a
beer
and
short
of
having
a
thumb
in
it
or
something
makes
it
appear
good
to
me
drinkability
i
wish
it
would
have
been
a
little
grassier
or
skunkier
but
it
is
tasty
and
refreshing
overall
not
the
best
pilsener
ive
had
but
not
the
worst
i
remember
pilsener
urquell
in
germany
being
better
than
this
since
the
fresher
beer
kept
just
the
most
subtle
kiss
of
hops
more
forward
in
the
flavor
profile
than
this
one
this
is
tolerable
i
suppose
but
after
a
couple
plinys
its
not
cutting
it
but
to
be
fair
its
tolerable
pours
a
transparent
straw
color
with
a
decent
head
of
white
foam
the
aroma
is
very
mild
smelling
faintly
of
saaz
hops
vague
sweetness
and
some
light
skunk
taste
is
almost
nonexistent
on
the
front
end
consisting
of
carbonation
and
an
indefinable
something
thats
technically
not
nothing
some
honeylike
sweetness
emerges
in
the
finish
as
youre
still
racking
your
brain
to
determine
if
you
actually
tasted
anything
at
all
while
the
modicum
of
flavor
that
exists
is
not
offensive
its
so
mild
that
its
bordering
on
seltzer
water
even
an
american
light
macrobrew
has
bolder
flavor
than
this
im
an
admitted
skeptic
of
pilsners
to
begin
with
and
this
certainly
does
nothing
to
champion
their
cause
the
fine
print
on
the
back
of
this
beers
label
identifies
it
as
the
award
winning
authentic
czech
beer
our
postmodern
world
has
taught
aesthetes
to
be
suspicious
of
claims
of
authenticity
for
it
is
no
indication
of
quality
or
aesthetic
value
but
i
was
surprised
to
read
that
this
beer
has
won
awards
where
from
whom
the
bottle
doesnt
tell
us
this
important
bit
of
information
the
body
is
as
light
as
expected
but
not
boring
even
veering
toward
medium
almost
with
a
semidry
feel
as
rather
than
clashing
somehow
a
dryness
mingles
with
the
sweeter
maltier
elements
its
consistently
crisp
and
has
a
nice
underlying
smoothness
as
well
this
poured
a
clean
golden
tan
color
with
creamy
foam
there
was
a
honeyed
sweet
aroma
on
it
followed
by
a
faded
honeyed
hop
flavor
with
light
bitterness
not
very
tasty
even
going
from
ice
cold
serving
temps
to
slightly
warming
a
stale
cereal
malt
flavor
like
bad
coors
dominated
pour
or
pass
on
this
o
a
very
nice
and
simple
lager
id
pick
this
up
again
for
2
per
500ml
bottle
id
love
to
have
this
with
some
kielbasa
or
stuffed
cabbage
with
mustard
kraut
and
potatoes
the
mouthfeel
is
standardissue
for
the
style
if
youre
worrying
that
the
body
would
be
syrupthick
since
the
malts
are
so
strong
on
the
nose
and
tongue
then
fret
not
its
still
a
thinbodied
beer
overall
this
is
not
a
good
pils
it
is
way
way
too
maltforward
especially
for
a
pilsner
in
the
czech
tradition
what
a
weird
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
just
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
cant
knock
it
d
very
easy
to
drink
o
excellent
pilsner
that
i
can
only
imagine
would
be
better
in
prague
overall
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
still
ok
the
brew
pours
a
supertranslucent
golden
hue
and
is
capped
with
a
modicum
of
white
wispy
head
the
nose
is
herbal
and
a
bit
grassy
and
has
a
mineralmetallic
note
underlying
theres
also
a
soft
powdery
note
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
quite
grainy
and
slightly
sweet
it
is
mostly
pleasant
but
gets
a
bit
of
rankness
on
the
finish
feelwise
it
is
lighter
than
medium
and
softly
carbonated
pretty
good
overall
though
it
is
decent
it
is
definitely
not
a
toptier
czech
pils
id
take
say
staropromen
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
o
a
great
euro
pilsener
that
somehow
manages
to
beat
out
the
local
made
ones
despite
coming
from
across
the
world
in
who
knows
what
kind
of
conditions
pretty
good
but
not
a
must
have
o
a
bit
disappointing
missing
is
the
hopiness
of
a
true
czech
pils
your
average
german
pils
has
more
fairly
smooth
but
a
bit
more
grassiness
that
there
should
be
czech
rebel
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
thin
cap
of
foam
above
the
aroma
is
green
apple
and
pale
biscuitlike
malt
grainy
pale
malt
greets
the
taste
buds
a
slight
sweetness
through
the
center
as
bitterness
moves
in
finishes
with
a
snap
this
is
a
clean
brew
not
bad
really
dry
finish
a
decent
summer
offering
o
nice
flavor
for
the
style
would
drink
another
final
notes
this
beer
is
ok
not
great
not
bad
but
just
okay
i
wont
be
looking
to
buy
it
again
loved
the
name
if
the
beer
it
made
me
wanna
try
it
which
is
good
for
the
brewery
but
as
i
sat
down
to
enjoy
this
brew
i
realized
that
i
really
cant
get
into
pilasters
too
much
so
i
sat
there
trying
to
toss
back
a
rather
large
bottle
of
beer
for
myself
clear
yellow
and
grassy
and
a
fluffy
head
on
this
one
rebel
pours
a
pale
amber
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
at
first
i
get
a
bit
of
bready
malt
in
the
aroma
then
some
hop
spicyness
becomes
apparent
bready
malt
is
most
noticeable
at
first
in
the
flavor
there
is
also
a
hint
of
caramel
there
is
a
nice
noble
hop
spice
that
is
a
bit
muted
while
the
beer
is
still
cold
a
nice
sessionable
pils
easy
to
drink
could
have
more
flavor
though
picked
up
a
bottle
at
euromart
for
a
2
25
the
aroma
is
a
bit
simple
with
bready
spice
the
body
seems
just
a
little
watery
but
theres
a
great
mixture
of
sweet
bready
barley
with
herbal
grassy
lemon
hop
character
despite
being
a
little
lighter
than
other
czech
pilsners
its
also
very
drinkable
and
still
very
flavorful

a
decent
value
i
would
try
it
again
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
d
the
beer
isnt
difficult
to
drink
but
the
flavor
isnt
very
interesting
so
im
not
sure
if
i
will
try
it
again
drinkabiility
a
good
pilsner
didnt
love
it
but
didnt
hate
it
i
would
try
it
again
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
d
yes
this
is
a
nice
light
beer
would
take
a
6
pack
out
on
a
boating
trip
for
sure
finger
and
a
half
of
cream
white
foam
the
bubbles
explode
at
such
a
fast
rate
you
think
willy
wonka
is
behind
it
all
gone
done
to
the
surface
like
that
no
lacing
left
behind
light
orange
liquid
not
pale
transparent
with
very
mild
visual
distortion
a
few
scattered
bubbles
here
and
there
the
nose
has
a
nice
liveliness
to
it
lots
of
all
kinds
of
bread
like
one
big
marble
loaf
in
your
nostrils
sweet
golden
honey
accents
general
maltiness
then
more
salt
n
pepper
than
herbaceousness
tame
mixed
white
fruits
it
seems
like
it
aims
to
mix
things
together
like
a
stew
than
let
the
elements
stand
apart
mediumbodied
strong
through
the
attack
before
relaxing
and
just
letting
it
flow
unfold
as
it
wants
honey
molasses
and
caramel
very
obvious
while
displaying
restraint
when
needed
the
breadiness
is
more
doughy
than
yeasty
and
had
the
crust
cut
off
a
few
corn
notes
the
carbonation
somewhat
lowgrade
not
a
deciding
factor
more
floral
than
fruity
or
citrusy
hops
bring
tingle
to
the
finish
so
it
does
end
on
an
up
note
almost
like
a
slightly
undercarbonated
soda
pop
with
tinge
of
bitterness
too
sweet
but
so
drinkable
like
soda
because
it
kinda
tastes
like
soda
drinkability
not
sure
i
care
for
the
sweetness
and
wonder
what
is
causing
it
but
i
certainly
dont
find
the
hop
profile
on
this
beer
appealing
either
i
was
excited
to
try
this
czech
pilsner
but
thats
where
it
ends
its
okay
though
not
worth
a
second
purchase
at
2
99
for
a
12
ounce
bottle
the
czech
rebel
follows
the
tradition
of
the
czech
pilsener
to
a
t
taste
is
kinda
weird
its
got
a
kind
of
mustiness
to
it
there
is
some
maltiness
to
it
but
honestly
its
not
that
great
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
with
a
small
hop
bite
but
theres
just
some
weird
off
taste
that
i
cant
explain
thats
turning
me
off
drinkability
having
enjoyed
many
czech
pilsners
while
living
in
slovakia
for
three
months
i
consider
myself
somewhat
an
expert
on
the
style
this
one
is
a
bit
lacking
compared
to
many
but
isnt
necessarily
bad
fairly
average
overall
i
cant
say
its
not
worth
it
but
there
are
others
of
the
style
i
would
try
before
this
one
a
real
czech
pils
shouldnt
have
the
corn
flavors
either
but
luckily
this
one
doesnt
have
overwhelming
corn
notes
preventing
it
from
being
terrible
pours
a
light
orangish
amber
slight
nose
typical
of
a
czech
pilsner
sweet
hops
and
malty
scent
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
clean
lacks
the
depth
of
character
in
both
hops
and
malts
that
some
other
czech
pilsners
have
still
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
the
kind
of
beer
where
you
could
have
one
or
two
or
three
just
about
anywhere
an
interesting
pils
the
corn
flavor
and
aroma
blew
me
away
maybe
i
havnt
had
a
lot
of
czech
pilsners
dont
think
there
is
any
corn
in
there
maybe
the
yeast
who
knows
all
in
all
not
too
bad
but
probably
wouldnt
try
again
overall
a
decent
czech
pils
but
ive
had
better
i
would
like
it
better
if
there
were
more
malt
character
but
more
than
anything
more
hop
character
would
be
nice
comes
to
close
to
the
adjunct
category
for
me
to
honestly
say
it
was
worth
eleven
dollars
the
only
difference
between
this
beer
shown
and
mine
is
that
mine
has
a
gold
label
and
is
4
8abvit
pours
a
nice
golden
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
two
finger
fast
vanishing
head
and
no
lacingit
has
a
rather
subtle
aroma
of
grassyherbal
hops
not
much
else
gets
thruit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
which
doesnt
have
much
body
to
it
but
is
very
sessionable
with
tastes
of
grassy
herbal
hops
and
some
pale
golden
malts
and
by
no
means
is
this
beer
a
brew
that
you
would
recommend
to
someone
or
remember
but
would
buy
a
carton
of
for
a
party
if
cheap
enoughits
definately
not
my
sort
of
brew
that
i
enjoy
drinking
at
home
and
wouldnt
buy
it
again
unless
i
had
a
party
to
go
to
drinkability
is
good
like
most
pils
a
bit
surprised
by
the
lower
ratings
here
this
offering
alone
shows
me
why
czech
pilsners
are
renown
the
world
over
and
are
drunken
by
the
litre
in
their
homeland
this
is
a
fair
beer
for
its
style
but
the
elements
of
age
may
be
hurting
it
a
bit
not
a
good
comparable
to
pilsner
urquell
a
bit
better
than
the
average
pilsener
i
noticed
a
lightly
musty
aroma
late
in
the
beer
after
it
had
warmed
not
bad
for
the
style
highly
drinkable
but
likely
too
simplistic
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
harsh
hop
bite
absolutely
worth
a
try
dprobably
not
unless
i
crave
a
bitter
malty
beer
not
what
id
reach
for
on
a
night
out
with
friends
or
while
lounging
at
home
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
malts
taste
is
crisp
slightly
sweet
some
malts
and
fruits
very
flavorful
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
with
ease
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
brew
d
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
others
of
this
style
that
i
would
go
for
first
definitely
worth
an
additional
purchase
review
relative
to
style
pours
pale
golden
color
with
beautiful
large
creamy
white
head
nose
is
light
with
a
whiff
of
hops
very
light
malt
flavor
with
light
balancing
of
hops
extremely
refreshing
and
drinkable
and
far
superior
to
u
s
comparables
good
looking
dark
golden
clear
bubbly
body
with
a
nice
big
head
smell
is
floral
and
fruity
with
a
dry
biscuity
backbone
clean
and
balanced
flavor
some
pine
lemony
citrus
cut
nicely
by
a
spicy
hop
bitterness
and
yesty
fresh
baked
bread
and
sweet
toffee
like
malts
good
sharp
carbonation
makes
for
a
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
maybe
just
a
little
metalic
skunky
aftertaste
comes
out
but
not
bad
overall
very
clean
and
skunk
free
probably
the
least
skunk
filled
european
lager
i
have
ever
had
nice
beer
rather
lackluster
this
beer
opens
with
a
delicate
grain
character
very
dry
and
cracker
like
with
a
mild
husky
flavor
hop
flavor
is
also
quite
restrained
theres
a
little
earthy
character
the
finish
is
solid
a
touch
of
bitterness
appearing
initially
before
a
strange
medicinal
astringency
appears
the
sulfur
character
grows
as
it
warms
just
a
little
thin
and
watery
for
my
liking
the
body
could
use
a
little
more
heft
drying
on
the
finish
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
one
that
id
like
to
try
fresh
ho
hum
pils
name
rebel
is
perhaps
a
bit
melodramatic
in
any
case
a
drinkable
pils
of
no
special
attributes
head
is
white
and
a
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
yelllow
aroma
is
crisp
yet
slightly
malty
and
hoppy
beery
flavor
is
about
the
same
average
body
and
carbonation
ditto
finish
ok
beer
if
it
had
a
different
name
im
sure
id
have
a
better
opinion
just
me
sorry
rebel
yell
overall
the
beer
isnt
bad
but
i
wont
purchase
it
again
pours
a
medium
amber
with
white
pillow
head
aroma
is
classic
czech
pills
not
overpowering
but
a
nice
kiss
there
is
a
hint
of
smokiness
in
the
taste
malt
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
nice
slight
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
luscious
and
drinkability
is
very
high
nice
solid
beer
an
excellent
czech
pilsthough
not
one
that
is
the
typical
yellow
gold
not
a
great
beer
but
id
have
this
over
alot
of
others
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
malty
aroma
with
sweetish
bready
notes
and
a
touch
of
grass
flavor
is
sweet
with
toasty
malts
and
a
lightly
floral
hoppiness
clean
somewhat
watery
finish
some
grassy
and
mineral
notes
super
refreshing
pretty
crisp
overall
a
very
underrated
pilsener
in
my
opinion
its
got
enough
flavor
to
make
it
enjoyable
to
drink
but
is
light
enough
to
warrant
drinking
the
whole
pint
without
ill
effect
an
admirable
choice
for
a
session
brew
pours
goldenyellow
with
a
white
head
that
fades
into
a
thin
lace
smells
of
clean
grains
grassy
i
guess
and
a
lot
floral
noble
hop
notes
tastes
mildy
sweet
pale
malty
flavors
vaguely
metalic
and
a
lot
of
floral
aromatic
hops
noble
hops
saaz
im
sure
dominate
the
palate
slight
bitterness
keeps
the
beer
refreshing
throughout
drinking
it
along
with
the
fairly
high
amount
of
carbonation
giving
it
a
sharp
nip
when
you
swallow
each
gulp
drinks
easy
not
a
bad
pils
a
fine
standard
example
of
the
style
the
also
a
a
nice
characterful
yet
light
czech
character
it
has
a
lot
of
lightly
toasty
bread
light
fruitiness
with
grass
and
herbs
light
sweetness
balancing
a
light
zesty
bitterness
although
the
sweetnes
seems
to
just
barely
have
the
edge
over
the
bitterness
at
first
beyond
the
finish
the
bitterness
lingers
lightly
its
light
in
body
but
slightly
oily
wellrounded
in
fel
with
lively
zesty
frothiness
a
very
nice
texture
although
straightforward
and
light
it
has
good
flavour
and
light
complexity
and
the
character
holds
up
very
well
with
great
balance
of
the
elements
rebel
is
a
very
clear
golden
beer
with
a
soft
dense
white
head
that
fades
and
leaves
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
fruity
rather
sweet
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
funk
it
smells
pretty
nice
and
actually
reminds
me
of
the
way
bedele
smells
its
pretty
light
bodied
and
a
little
papery
especially
at
the
finish
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
a
light
grassy
bitterness
notes
of
lemon
and
pretzels
and
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
its
better
than
most
european
lagers
ive
had
it
must
be
because
of
the
brown
bottle
pours
a
darker
yellow
than
other
pilsners
with
one
inch
of
white
head
that
quickly
settles
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
noble
hop
skunk
aroma
a
little
sweet
malt
is
also
noted
the
flavor
is
on
the
sweeter
side
of
pils
mild
graininess
and
moderate
amount
of
noble
hop
flavor
nice
texture
and
body
to
the
beer
it
is
light
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
not
harsh
i
prefer
my
pils
to
be
on
the
drier
side
if
you
like
them
a
little
sweet
this
may
be
an
option
for
you
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
tad
bit
bitter
okay
for
this
beer
to
be
a
good
czech
beer
the
saaz
hops
needs
to
be
more
pronounced
i
think
i
got
an
aged
bottle
of
beer
the
beer
is
bland
uninteresting
and
okay
at
best
this
brew
pours
up
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
nice

the

ill
finish
the

but
wont
buy
again
although
if
it
was
given
to
me
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
it
was

detracts
from

d
one
of
the
best
czech
pils
ive
had
from
across
the
pond
once
poured
and
tasted
i
had
a
craving
for
more
got
to
go
back
and
buy
a
6pack
as
i
only
bought
this
lone
single
refreshing
on
this
hot
january
night
i
began
a
sushieating
beer
drinking
presidential
inauguration
watching
session
with
this
beer
the
other
day
poured
a
clear
gold
with
a
small
white
head
more
colorful
than
most
pilseners
aromas
was
faint
but
good
grassy
hops
and
honeysweet
malts
lovely
taste
perfectly
balanced
light
malts
with
a
grassy
hop
finish
wellcrafted
light
body
eminently
drinkable
and
refreshing
an
excellent
way
to
kick
off
a
session
a
solidly
made
flavorful
pilsener
d
this
beer
has
some
decent
attributes
and
is
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
its
just
not
that
interesting
in
the
taste
department
d
just
an
ok
czech
pils
easily
sessionable
and
would
pick
it
over
the
run
of
the
mill
american
macro
lager
or
pils
oh
i
see
its
only
4
4
no
wonder
well
it
sure
wouldnt
be
a
session
brew
for
me
nikki
pours
deep
clear
gold
with
a
onefinger
white
head
plentifully
laced
aroma
is
very
floral
hoppy
for
a
pils
and
not
a
trace
of
skunk
must
be
a
fresh
one
taste
is
full
on
saaz
type
hops
with
just
a
hint
of
sweet
malts
a
bit
of
bread
with
just
a
touch
of
butter
mouthfeel
is
about
right
and
the
drinkability
is
awesome
thanks
to
the

abv
the
czechs
make
excellent
beer
the
label
says
since
1333
that
is
an
old
brewery
d
chuggalugg
definite
session
beer
my
friend
paul
and
i
used
to
get
these
on
queens
blvd
for
99
cents
alot
a
few
years
ago
no
glass
to
pour
into
just
bottle
always
impressed
us
especially
at
the
price
we
used
to
pack
a
bag
full
with
16
or
so
and
go
to
town
i
dont
know
if
he
still
drinks
thembeing
in
hell
a
and
all
i
stopped
drinking
them
because
i
came
across
uniformaly
skunky
ones
all
the
time
it
was
a
good
ride
in
the
late
90s
but
i
awitched
to
ballantine
ale
after
all
the
pepe
le
pew
none
the
less
it
had
a
great
price
and
great
drinkability
in
its
time
another
friend
who
is
czech
still
swears
by
these
and
brings
a
case
to
most
bbqs
not
that
easy
to
find
in
the
five
boros
anymore
but
i
think
i
will
seek
one
out
as
im
getting
sentimental
writing
this
thing
i
poured
this
cheap
looking
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
had
a
nice
golden
color
and
that
was
all
that
was
nice
the
smell
was
slightly
sour
and
i
thought
the
taste
was
sour
or
flat
also
the
head
was
nonexistant
as
was
any
lacing
very
poor
quality
beer
and
i
will
not
buy
again
this
beer
looks
great
is
crystal
clear
and
has
a
decent
head
on
top
her
nose
is
a
bit
timid
and
could
use
some
kick
perhaps
some
additional
nobel
or
saaz
hops
are
in
order
flavor
is
ok
but
when
in
the
same
game
as
many
great
czech
pilseners
you
really
have
to
be
on
your
toes
and
this
beer
fall
a
bit
short
but
after
a
few
more
drinks
i
am
getting
into
the
beer
more
and
i
would
say
that
its
worth
a
go
if
you
a
fan
of
pilseners
dont
pay
to
much
attention
to
ratings
just
give
it
a
go
and
decide
for
yourself
a
very
drinkable
pilsner
perfect
for
a
hot
day
or
with
a
light
meal
d
good
drinkability
crisp
with
a
great
grain
palate
and
soft
hopping
that
is
perfectly
fitted
to
style
an
easy
session
and
dare
i
say
case
worthy
honestly
this
beer
went
down
before
i
even
realized
it
was
that
smooth
pours
to
a
thick
bubbly
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
plenty
of
lace
color
is
deep
golden
aroma
is
of
sweet
pilsner
malt
and
a
bit
of
spicy
czech
hops
and
a
little
butter
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
saaz
hop
flavor
and
aroma
and
clean
light
malt
sweetness
finishes
with
a
nice
dry
bitterness
pretty
good
stuff
i
appreciated
the
slight
buttery
diacetyl
taste
which
is
reminiscent
of
what
pilsner
urquell
used
to
be
mfd
light
crisp
and
easy
drinking
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
no
alcohol
detectable
very
refreshing
stuff
and
a
good
depiction
of
the
style
clean
clear
pale
golden
yellow
strawish
you
might
say
small
yet
persistent
eggshell
white
head
nose
of
honeytinged
malts
powdered
sugar
sourdough
starter
big
saazy
hops
a
little
skunkiness
but
also
very
seaair
like
smells
good
starts
with
lightly
toasted
biscuit
malt
some
tangy
hop
flavor
in
there
as
well
bready
middle
with
hints
of
cardboard
honey
and
fruit
apples
pears
skunky
funky
hop
bitterness
increases
toward
a
dryish
finish
not
bad
but
could
do
without
the
wet
cardboard
lightbodied
with
a
refreshing
sparkling
feel
might
be
better
fresh

tucson
az
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
good
bit
of
carb
although
the
12
inch
white
head
disappeared
as
quick
as
it
formed
smelled
like
a
typical
lager
with
minimal
hops
coming
through
nothing
much
to
speak
of
there
the
taste
was
decent
though
very
faint
slight
hop
bite
with
apple
pear
type
sweetness
heavy
on
the
carb
but
it
suits
this
beer
well
light
crisp
and
easy
drinking
not
overly
flavorful
but
would
definitely
pair
nice
with
some
brats
onions
and
kraut
throw
in
a
hot
summer
day
and
this
could
make
due
halfliter
bottle
with
no
visible
freshness
date
there
are
visible
protein
clumps
in
the
bottle
but
there
are
almost
none
after
the
pour
though
it
does
look
unfiltered
the
beer
is
solid
gold
with
low
carbonation
and
three
fingers
of
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
a
few
rings
of
lace
in
the
nose
its
mildly
hoppy
with
a
light
dose
of
malts
not
too
aromatic
but
pleasant
tastes
of
nice
noble
hops
and
a
bit
of
sweet
malts
grassy
and
spicy
with
light
lemon
and
pine
a
little
doughy
with
a
near
medium
bitterness
on
top
of
a
light
dry
body
that
has
a
lightish
hoppy
finish
not
the
best
pilsner
but
its
a
very
pleasing
lager
that
is
easy
to
session
cheap
and
worth
a
try
onspot
for
a
classic
pils
overall
if
the
taste
matched
the
aroma
better
well
that
would
make
for
a
better
brew
but
as
it
is
its
a
classic
refresher
pours
a
clear
amber
with
no
head
nose
is
like
dirty
grains
flavor
carries
a
slight
body
and
then
goes
metallic
on
me
real
quick
i
have
a
feeling
this
might
be
drain
pour
very
soon
feel
has
a
nice
bubble
on
it
but
a
thin
liquid
feel
overall
not
very
good
wouldnt
suggest
it
and
not
sure
it
is
even
worth
trying
pass
try
a
rebel
beer
this
isnt
just
your
average
european
lager
nice
golden
brown
color
and
plenty
of
carbonation
i
used
to
buy
this
frequently
because
it
was
only
2
bucks
for
a
16
9
bottle
of
course
with
prices
going
up
it
is
no
longer
only
2
bucks
anyways
it
wasnt
something
that
you
would
go
out
of
your
way
for
but
it
did
have
some
nice
qualities
that
you
would
consider
picking
up
a
bottle
or
two
along
with
a
6pk
of
something
else
i
had
left
rebel
alone
after
a
couple
of
notsogood
bottles
after
this
one
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
it
again
no
bad
after
taste
goes
down
easy
but
after
you
are
done
you
just
want
to
say
ok
whats
next
got
this
one
at
a
beer
tasting
no
real
head
on
a
standard
golden
looking
beer
nose
is
fruit
some
light
spice
flavor
is
mediocre
grain
and
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
standard
for
the
type
overall
a
mediocre
beer
not
one
id
seek
out
by
any
means
pours
a
very
dark
gold
color
perfectly
clear
with
only
a
minimal
dusting
of
head
smells
like
a
typical
but
uninspired
pilsner
a
touch
of
tangy
hops
but
not
enough
to
make
things
distinctive
alongside
some
insipid
sour
malt
smells
on
the
palate
good
bitterness
first
off
framed
by
dry
bready
malts
at
the
midpalate
the
finish
is
nicely
dry
but
the
aftertaste
is
quite
unpleasant
kind
of
a
vegetal
and
acrid
overall
an
ok
pilsner
with
some
serious
flaws
but
nothing
to
shout
about
and
nothing
to
purchase
again
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
not
spectacular
but
refreshing
with
a
nice
biting
presence
good
for
a
warm
summer
day
and
possibly
quite
sessionable
due
to
the
lower
abv
for
the
price
it
cant
be
beat
get
budvar
or
krusovice
if
you
are
not
being
cheap
though
a
little
thin
and
weak
but
easy
to
throw
down
at
the
end
of
the
night
or
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
and
at
1
29
for
a
half
litter
the
price
is
right
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
didnt
leave
much
lacing
has
a
sweet
malt
bready
smell
to
it
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
has
a
sweet
malt
flavor
almost
caramel
followed
by
nice
hop
flavor
the
hop
is
not
as
pronounced
as
amercian
pilsners
but
it
adds
to
the
drinkability
has
a
light
mouthfeel
but
not
watery
no
dryness
to
be
detected
not
as
zesty
as
i
would
have
thought
but
it
has
a
nice
subtle
hop
flavor
a
quite
hoppy
pils
with
little
malt
balance
the
appearanc
eis
golden
with
and
nice
hoppy
nose
and
yes
the
hops
do
dominate
this
brew
as
said
before
quite
hoppy
so
not
the
best
balance
for
this
pils
smooth
moutheel
silky
yet
cleansing
and
astringent
the
pucker
at
the
end
leave
the
drinkability
a
little
lower
than
other
pils
opinion
this
is
an
ok
beer
it
has
a
bit
of
a
harsh
aftertaste
for
such
a
light
beer
i
dont
really
get
any
adjuncts
here
but
i
suspect
that
the
water
in
pilsen
has
changed
a
bit
since
this
style
was
created
it
has
a
bitter
edge
like
there
was
gypsum
used
in
this
beer
to
make
up
for
the
calcium
bad
choice
if
that
was
the
case
i
will
drink
this
whole
beer
but
i
wont
be
drinking
it
much
more
in
the
future
overall
a
nice
czech
pils
i
have
passed
this
beer
by
so
many
times
in
the
supermarket
and
am
glad
i
finally
tried
it
a
nice
refreshing
brew
this
has
become
my
summer
goto
beer
cheap
and
good
this
is
a
beer
i
have
been
meaning
to
try
for
a
while
and
im
glad
i
finally
did
i
havent
tried
a
czech
beer
that
i
havent
liked
yet
but
this
was
one
of
the
best
that
ive
tried
highly
recommended
if
you
dont
mind
a
little
skunk
taste
is
average
clean
and
crisp
with
hops
in
the
background
nothing
special
that
sets
this
apart
still
its
a
decent
beer
that
fits
in
the
style
perhaps
it
got
spoiled
coming
overseas
decently
drinkable
and
refreshing
yeah
this
a
review
from
memory
but
i
used
to
buy
this
by
the
case
so
trust
me
i
really
can
only
tell
you
that
to
my
taste
buds
pilsner
taste
either
bad
good
or
very
good
most
taste
bad
they
reminde
me
of
lawnmower
beer
this
one
tastes
good
and
occationally
ive
had
an
excellent
pilsner
but
only
from
tap
from
a
bottle
pilsner
can
only
be
so
good
and
i
think
rebel
is
as
close
to
that
limit
as
ive
had
though
it
could
use
being
turned
up
a
notch
the
taste
is
crisp
and
very
bitter
i
wish
miller
and
their
ilk
would
spring
for
1
19
on
this
bad
boy
and
take
some
notes
this
is
how
pilsners
are
done
a
hoppy
bitterness
stays
with
the
tastebuds
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
the
quality
water
adds
to
the
surprisingly
smooth
mouthfeel
if
you
like
czech
pilsner
like
i
do
you
can
drink
these
all
night
mint
very
drinkable
and
highly
underrated
this
beer
was
not
at
all
skunked
it
poured
a
golden
amber
and
it
left
a
thin
white
head
the
taste
was
clean
and
pretty
dry
i
recommend
this
beer
but
its
hard
to
make
sure
that
it
hasnt
skunked
if
you
can
find
a
fresh
bottle
then
you
should
give
it
a
try
youll
be
pleased
pours
a
clear
pale
amber
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
lace
nose
is
stale
grains
along
with
some
mineral
notes
taste
begins
with
a
light
caramel
maltiness
followed
by
some
grassy
and
herbal
hops
towards
the
end
leading
to
a
rather
crisp
finish
a
pretty
average
pilsner
thats
certainly
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
though
better
choices
are
not
hard
to
find
golden
yellow
with
a
sticky
white
head
has
good
head
retention
smells
like
spicy
saaz
hops
and
grains
has
a
meduimlight
body
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
that
can
be
felt
on
the
tounge
taste
clean
with
a
spicy
saaz
hop
up
front
and
a
grainy
metallic
finish
rebel
is
true
to
the
style
and
goes
great
with
any
heavy
meal
overall
a
fine
beer
ive
got
to
take
off
a
few
points
for
the
relatively
minimal
smell
but
quite
good
the
bottle
says
that
the
brewery
was
founded
in
1333
and
i
think
i
must
have
just
tried
one
of
their
very
first
beers
ever
made
from
around
the
same
date
atleast
thats
the
way
it
tasted
pure
skunk
the
ridiculous
amount
of
skunk
flavor
was
so
intense
that
it
overwhelmed
every
aspect
of
the
beer
i
didnt
pour
it
so
i
cant
say
anything
about
the
appearance
but
all
i
could
smell
was
putrid
skunk
and
all
i
could
taste
was
bitter
skunk
as
soon
as
i
took
a
sip
my
girlfriend
said
she
could
smell
my
skunk
breath
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
was
really
meant
to
be
this
way
or
if
i
just
ran
into
an
outrageously
old
bottle
i
may
try
again
just
to
see
drinkabilitynotes
the
heavyhanded
use
of
hops
spoiled
my
enjoyment
of
what
would
have
otherwise
been
a
pleasant
beer
czechvar
is
a
much
more
pleasing
example
of
the
style
there
are
3
inches
of
creamy
white
bubbly
fluffy
head
that
leave
crusty
sticky
lacing
the
beer
is
a
very
clear
rich
gold
big
saaz
nose
spicy
almost
cinnamon
very
nice
starts
crisp
fresh
fruity
with
some
serious
caramel
through
the
faint
tingly
middle
finishes
nicely
bitter
dry
crackers
some
nice
grain
not
bad
at
all
some
nice
caramel
and
grain
with
temperature
i
like
it
overall
impression
a
good
pils
clean
full
refreshing
its
everything
it
should
be
i
feel
like
my
scores
are
for
the
style
more
than
the
beer
this
one
is
well
made
thanks
to
ba
pegasus
for
dropping
one
off
for
me
to
try
and
to
ba
assurbanipaul
for
recommending
it
as
a
czech
lager
this
suffers
in
comparison
to
its
competition
but
its
not
without
its
merits
and
to
be
fair
there
is
some
stiff
competition
its
crystalclear
golden
body
is
quite
attractive
and
its
frothy
brightwhite
head
holds
a
short
lid
fairly
well
but
leaves
only
minor
spotty
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
bold
with
a
combination
of
grainy
malt
and
some
spicy
floral
and
mildly
grassy
hops
the
flavor
delivers
a
nicely
balanced
combination
of
grainy
malt
and
spicy
herbal
and
floral
hops
a
solid
bitterness
permeates
it
and
leaves
it
dry
in
the
finish
with
some
lingering
hops
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
available
at
the
same
price
but
it
remains
an
enjoyable
pils
in
its
own
right
an
ok
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
have
another
this
brew
is
a
pale
straw
gold
color
with
a
white
bubbly
head
topping
it
off
sweet
malt
and
spicy
hops
combine
for
the
aroma
sweet
malt
up
front
clean
grains
blended
bitter
hop
backbone
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
some
sort
of
weird
aftertaste
takes
off
a
couple
points
but
overall
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
with
active
carbonation
a
very
fresh
bottle
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
tastes
like
what
i
think
an
urquell
should
taste
like
nice
to
see
another
pils
selection
in
this
area
one
of
the
better
czech
pilsners
available
in
the
us
drier
than
pilsner
urquell
with
perhaps
a
touch
more
hops
bohemiam
pilsners
arent
my
favorite
style
but
every
now
and
their
their
delicate
subtlety
is
appealing
light
to
medium
bodied
i
wouldnt
bother
trying
it
again
i
have
no
major
quarrels
with
the
beer
its
look
smell
taste
and
feel
is
all
there
granted
its
nothing
to
sing
about
but
it
doesnt
dissapoint
bottle
is
drained
with
ease
deep
dark
golden
yellow
strong
odor
of
cheap
skunky
beer
like
bud
very
little
head
smell
is
overwhelming
while
the
taste
is
barely
there
sharp
bite
on
the
mouthfeel
starts
out
bitter
slightly
sweet
in
the
middle
and
on
the
very
short
finish
not
impressed
yet
somehow
less
bad
than
i
expected
great
bitter
hop
overtones
in
the
mouth
and
a
medium
body
medium
carbonation
as
it
warms
it
develops
a
bizarre
ginger
ale
taste
which
i
enjoyed
aftertaste
is
weak
and
metallic
which
makes
it
sound
like
its
strong
and
powerfulbut
really
its
not
that
good
this
beer
is
a
very
clear
golden
color
the
white
head
did
not
last
long
at
all
there
is
light
hop
aroma
with
a
little
malt
also
this
beer
starts
out
very
crisp
then
slightly
malty
with
an
odd
finish
a
pretty
average
easy
drinking
beer
the
after
its
release
from
the
12ounce
green
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
luminous
gold
with
a
mountainous
bright
white
head
that
is
frothy
in
texture
and
the
lace
a
fine
covering
upon
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
fresh
and
clean
to
the
senses
start
quite
sweet
fair
malt
profile
and
the
top
thin
finish
is
moderate
in
its
acidity
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
drinkable
but
not
anything
special
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
pilsners
but
this
may
just
be
one
of
the
best
beers
you
can
drink
while
sitting
alongside
the
pool
comfortable
and
easy
going
i
had
some
high
expections
going
in
with
this
beer
but
this
has
seriously
let
me
down
poured
out
a
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
looked
nice
actually
smell
wasnt
that
great
some
hops
were
detected
but
that
was
it
taste
was
the
same
as
smell
some
hop
bite
was
noticable
along
with
some
metallic
flavors
which
lasted
into
the
aftertaste
i
was
really
expecting
more
from
this
beer
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
bottle
some
skunkiness
was
in
the
aroma
but
this
was
a
let
down
for
sure
try
it
at
your
own
risk
this
is
a
session
beer
of
that
there
is
no
doubt
ive
heard
so
many
good
things
about
czech
beer
but
rebel
is
almost
certainly
not
one
that
aficionados
have
in
mind
when
praising
the
brewmasters
from
that
country
drinkability
its
a
good
solid
lager
but
i
think
id
grow
bored
with
it
in
short
order
then
again
i
feel
that
way
about
most
pilsners
so
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt
drinkabilty
good
session
beer
this
is
light
enough
in
flavor
to
never
overwhelm
but
still
a
little
boring
sometimes
i
happen
to
believe
that
a
lager
should
be
clear
thats
part
of
its
charm
this
beer
is
unfiltered
which
detracts
from
its
appeal
many
of
the
properties
common
to
most
czech
lagers
are
repeated
here
the
color
the
aroma
taste
been
there
done
that
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
flavor
is
off
a
note
and
there
are
otherwise
no
special
attributes
to
be
found
this
is
a
runofthemill
lager
that
fails
to
distinguish
itself
from
a
sea
of
more
worthy
contenders
pocket
as
in
one
hand
czeck
rebel
beer
in
the
other
flavor
is
slight
but
complex
dextrin
followed
by
a
bright
hoppy
note
and
a
mellow
long
slide
toward
bitterness
as
the
sip
leaves
the
tongue
very
drinkable
goes
with
anything
and
the
price
is
pretty
good
notes
aside
from
the
total
lack
of
head
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
think
i
might
even
buy
again
was
there
soap
in
my
glass
or
something
ill
give
it
another
review
when
i
drink
it
again
if
you
like
a
good
clean
pilsner
and
dig
your
hops
this
is
a
great
one
this
was
my
first
taste
of
czech
beer
and
if
this
one
is
any
sign
of
there
quality
i
will
probably
keep
my
distance
i
didnt
expect
this
to
blow
me
away
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
pilsner
first
of
all
i
am
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
was
very
flat
there
was
literally
no
head
what
so
ever
and
it
sure
isnt
hard
to
produce
a
head
in
a
pilsner
glass
secondly
it
just
reminded
me
of
something
that
you
would
buy
in
30
packs
at
the
grocery
store
for
8
99
i
cant
say
that
it
was
disgusting
at
all
but
it
had
absolutely
nothing
special
about
it
and
what
it
did
have
in
its
body
was
even
weak
the
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
spotty
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
there
is
the
presence
of
pale
malts
and
czech
style
aroma
hops
the
taste
is
decent
but
not
great
this
is
a
very
clean
tasting
beer
its
not
at
all
complex
in
malt
composition
but
it
goes
down
easy
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
is
low
bodied
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
served
in
a
5
liter
eurostyle
bottle
cool
red
lettering
pours
a
beautiful
gold
but
the
head
sucks
smells
vaguely
of
hops
but
nothing
bold
tastes
hoppy
and
slightly
bitter
but
taste
soon
dissapates
into
nothing
refreshing
but
nothing
outstanding
try
it
once
at
least
not
really
all
that
impressed
with
this
one
pretty
boring
looking
mass
produced
appearence
that
some
would
call
the
color
of
real
beer
see
through
pale
golden
with
little
head
and
almost
no
stick
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
the
flavors
cloying
leaving
a
sticky
sweet
residue
of
skunk
quite
beerless
in
flavor
more
adjunct
metalic
bitter
tinny
tasting
than
anything
the
finish
is
long
and
cloying
so
have
food
on
hand
to
wash
the
flavors
back
poured
nice
clear
yellow
head
goes
away
quickly
smell
is
hoppy
and
malty
taste
is
like
a
lager
roasted
malt
flavor
pretty
hoppy
nice
carbonation
i
am
not
as
fond
of
lagers
as
i
used
to
be
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
taste
stays
good
as
it
warms
up
that
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
most
american
lagers
this
is
reasonably
priced
for
an
import
also6

pours
a
straw
color
with
a
big
head
that
goes
very
quicklyquite
a
bubbly
brew
the
smell
was
a
little
musty
kinda
awkword
for
a
pilsner
i
thinkthee
is
some
slight
bready
aromas
as
well
the
taste
is
a
little
blahthere
is
a
little
hop
dryness
in
there
with
a
weak
sweetness
to
it
drinkable
but
not
overly
flavorfull
in
my
opinion
while
not
a
top
pilsner
this
beer
is
not
bad
certainly
much
better
then
mass
produced
beers
in
the
u
s
nothing
special
about
it
though
as
it
poured
very
clear
with
not
much
aroma
sort
of
a
reserved
grain
like
flavor
which
blends
with
a
slight
bitter
tone
not
much
else
for
me
to
say
other
then
it
was
enjoyable
clean
tasting
and
could
be
consumed
with
ease
16

no

faintly
of

little

taste
is
a
disappointment
very
little

weak
and
watery
thin

some
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
very
little
else
if
i
didnt

this
was
just
another
macro

in

faint

of

some

and
a

that
is
then
overcome
by
the

again
its
crisp
ill
give
it
that
very
drinkable
no
complaints
here
at
all
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
decent
light
golded
color
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
fizzy
head
however
fairly
decent
hop
aroma
although
not
very
complex
there
is
a
bit
of
maltiness
and
hop
bitterness
to
the
taste
not
up
in
the
budvar
catagory
but
overall
a
fairly
decent
quaff
while
not
terrible
this
has
some
critical
flaws
there
are

pops

disappears
quickly
and

not
at
all
taste
is
mostly
bitter
and
skunky
budesque
right
through
to
the
aftertaste
poured
out
half
the
bottle
its
very
clear
and
golden
a
ample
2
inch
head
of
fluffy
whiteness
forms
and
lasts
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
sweet
stronger
than
i
expected
the
flavor
is
very
subtle
though
which
i
definitely
expected
slightly
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
ill
take
this
over
any
u
s
macrolager
any
day
this
first
thing
that
stood
out
for
me
was
the
smell
strong
and
sweet
grassyoily
aroma
the
beer
poured
out
perfectly
clear
and
was
bright
and
golden
in
color
spritzy
head
the
taste
was
decent
good
blending
of
hops
and
malts
a
good
bohemian
pilsener
the
package
says
its
brewed
traditionally
with
open
vat
fermentation
locallymade
malts
traditional
saaz
hops
and
long
lagering
time
i
highly
recommend
this
one
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
pretty
quickly
slight
musty
malt
aroma
a
little
grassy
too
metallic
mineral
taste
with
a
bitter
bite
the
bitterness
seems
more
from
the
mettalic
character
than
hops
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
carbonation
good
not
a
bad
deal
at
99
a
bottle
but
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
spend
a
little
more
for
a
better
product
clear
golden
in
color
with
a
white
head
large
bubble
of
carbonation
and
a
bit
lacing
are
present
this
brew
has
a
semisweet
grainy
aroma
the
flavor
again
is
of
grain
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
start
the
finish
is
abrupt
and
dry
the
hop
bitterness
is
minimal
i
also
detected
a
bit
of
a
metallic
flavor
in
this
one
overall
it
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
extraordinary
stands
out
big

not

tea
and
certainly
not
in
league
with
the
czech
reps
best
pilseners
not
bad
but
no
better
a
pretty
nice
little
bohemian
pils
nose
is
soft
and
sweet
very
clean
gold
color
with
minimal

taste
is
grainy
not
a
lot
of
hop
bite
and
tends
to
taste
more
like
a
lager
to
me
a
good
one
though
it
does
have
a
slightly
dry
finish
creamy
texture
easy
drinking
thirst
quenching
a
good
summer
beer
cant
say
i
enjoyed
this
one
much
at
all
maybe
it
is
because
i
had
my
first
chimay
bleu
to
look
forward
to
after
this
but
i
had
trouble
gleaning
anything
positive
out
of
this
beer
this
one
was
1
19
as
opposed
to
the
brou
czech
which
was
99
but
i
enjoyed
the
brou
czech
more
go
figure
sharp
sour
flavor
and
aroma
was
weak
i
am
staying
away
from
this
one
a
pretty
average
lager
but
at
99cents
for
a
16
9
ounce
bottle
what
do
you
expect
this
was
very
drinkable
and
light
on
the
palate
it
poured
a
very
light
almost
clear
golden
colour
with
a
small
head
that
dissipated
rapidly
this
smelled
and
tasted
pretty
average
in
my
opinion
not
that
great
for
a
czech
lager
beer
and
no
where
near
as
good
as
the
excellent
czechvar
the
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
on
this
beer
and
the
taste
was
pretty
light
still
it
is
quite
a
value
and
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
nice
on
a
hot
day
obvious
turkish
influence
in
this
beer

off

not

nice
and

overall
an
okay
pilsener
but
certainly
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had

definitely
take
another
option
for
the

a

mark
a
good
clean
pale
lager
with
a
nice
decent
aroma
a
mild
tasting
low
body
clear
looking
and
clean
pilsner
some
bready
characteristics
and
light
hops
flavor
not
ordinarily
something
that
i
would
have
on
a
regular
basis
however
being
that
i
was
at
a
european
style
tavern
run
by
and
patronized
by
people
from
various
parts
of
the
former
yugoslavia
the
mood
was
perfect
furthermore
the
spicy
sausage
i
ate
with
it
was
the
perfect
counterpoint
decent
enough
beer
not
bad
for
a
pilsener
but
i
probably
should
have
tried
it
in
on
a
sunny
may
or
june
afternoon
instead
of
a
rainy
october
evening
o
this
is
a
pretty
standard
mass
produced
pilsner
it
seems
to
be
designed
less
to
impress
the
drinker
and
more
to
sell
pretty
good
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
on
the
lighter
side
the
nose
does
show
some
saaz
hop
character
as
well
as
a
light
doughy
malt
backdrop
its
all
so
slight
though
and
could
stand
to
be
a
little
stronger
it
falters
even
more
on
the
palate
where
the
hops
mostly
show
up
as
a
clean
bitterness
the
malt
becomes
more
toasty
than
it
promised
at
first
they
do
get
some
things
right
its
definitely
a
clean
beer
and
nothing
becomes
annoying
or
cloying
but
there
is
just
a
lack
of
complexity
that
ultimately
dooms
it
to
alsoran
status
its
really
only
about
toasty
malt
and
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
that
gets
too
monotonous
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
drinks
a
lot
like
the
nose
smells
fruit
rot
lagery
grains
corn
syrup
backend
bitterness
and
a
generic
sweetstale
carrythrough
has
a
note
of
light
green
apple
and
faint
caraway
some
fusel
and
mintiness
the
body
has
a
decent
shape
but
its
not
a
gamechanger
carbonated
averagely
better
than
your
average
euro
lager
but
thats
not
saying
too
much
especially
because
its
listed
as
a
czech
pils
bad
a

lager
i
tried
a
beer
from
croatia
karlovačko
it
was
horrible
really
im
not
sure
how
it
was
possible
to
make
a
beer
that
was
simultaneously
too
bitter
and
too
sweet
it
was
so
bad
i
could
only
stand
3
sips
before
i
donated
to
a
local
tree
in
the
park
karlovačko
has
a
very
thick
foamy
white
head
a
clear
bubbly
goldenstraw
appearance
and
some
splotchy
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
sweet
biscuit
barley
malt
and
a
touch
of
hop
oil
and
the
flavor
is
the
same
with
pleasant
grassy
hops
to
round
it
out
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
and
karlovačko
finishes
crisp
clean
refreshing
and
dry
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
rjt
just
above
average
in
its
style
and
class
a
country
tick
no
more
and
no
less
o
another
standard
euro
lager
in
an
ocean
of
lagers
o
a
tasty
lager
easily
sessioned
with
no
real
aftertaste
that
leave
you
wondering
if
youve
even
drank
a
beer
aside
from
not
having
any
head
this
is
a
great
beer
the
taste
was
an
almost
perfect
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
overall
my
first
croatian
beer
but
nothing
special
skunk
cereal
grains
a
very
classic
light
beer
smell
and
as
many
have
said
it
smells
a
lot
like
heineken
very
very
flavorless
theres
some
cereal
grains
going
on
but
not
much
else
thankfully
there
wasnt
any
of
the
skunk
flavor
detected
in
the
nose
the
finish
was
dry
and
again
very
flavorless
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
yeasty
and
spicy
notes
that
others
have
spoken
of
high
carbonation
not
that
good
o
karlovačko
is
a
beer
that
is
very
mellow
there
are
no
strong
tastes
there
are
no
strong
aromas
this
beer
is
smooth
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
people
who
enjoy
light
beers
should
try
karlovačko
seems
pretty
substandard
even
by
euro
pale
lager
measures
i
cant
bring
myself
to
rate
this
as
a
czech
pilsener
why
dont
we
have
a
european
adjunct
category
however
it
has
quite
a
beautiful
label
if
you
like
oldtimey
eastern
european
graphics
from
the
500
ml
bottle
bought
at
bevmo
so
i
get
what
i
deserve
theres
probably
a
reason
this
can
of
karlovacko
has
export
only
printed
across
its
label
croatians
know
better
than
to
waste
their
money
on
it
actually
in
truth
the
opposite
is
probably
true
if
ive
taken
anything
away
from
this
plain
adjunctridden
lager
its
that
nationalism
can
delude
people
of
anything
in
particular
that
their
beer
is
somehow
superior
croatians
are
free
to
enjoy
this
if
they
can
but
ill
pass
just
another
balkan
region
light
lagerpils
beer
this
one
pours
a
decent
looking
honey
color
with
a
one
inch
white
head
aromatically
its
similar
to
a
lot
of
the
other
beers
on
offer
here
in
sarajevo
bready
malts
balanced
by
faint
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
this
one
is
distinct
only
because
of
a
hint
of
floral
sweetness
that
comes
in
and
out
of
the
nose
flavor
is
quite
palatable
none
of
the
metallic
tainted
aftertaste
of
its
peers
but
the
sweetness
here
is
out
of
place
it
makes
the
beer
more
filling
than
it
should
be
its
also
usually
a
bit
skunky
in
bottled
form
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
less
than
medium
body
and
normal
carbonation
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
these
euro
lager
type
reviews
sound
the
same
which
is
a
frustrating
reflection
of
the
reality
that
is
standardized
brews
still
waiting
for
something
distinct
over
here
and
karlovacko
definitely
isnt
that
but
its
drinkable
enough
and
cheap
enough
to
be
on
regular
rotation
for
me
this
summer
final
grade
3
29
a
forgettable
c
karlovacko
isnt
bad
for
what
it
is
a
runofthemill
pale
euro
lager
better
than
ozujsko
and
better
than
many
of
the
more
widelydistributed
epls
but
if
a
genuine
pilsener
is
your
bag
then
this
isnt
something
i
can
seriously
recommend
if
you
need
a
highly
drinkable
fairly
enjoyable
lager
to
drink
with
saltygreasy
food
or
on
a
hot
patio
this
is
definitely
a
worthy
selection
though
1001

com
o
low
drinkability
poor
overall
an
above
average
beer
and
clearly
surpassed
expectation
o
after
getting
over
the
initial
shock
of
the
smell
when
opening
the
bottle
i
think
this
a
decent
beer
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
pleasant
flavor
and
appearance
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
but
could
use
a
bit
more
flavors
of
bready
malts
and
floral
hops
out
of
a
bomber
this
beer
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
eggshellwhite
head
the
retention
as
a
skim
was
not
bad
and
it
left
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
faint
blend
of
dry
grains
and
sweet
malt
the
flavors
were
very
generic
and
though
ive
seen
this
beer
billed
as
a
czech
pilsner
in
truth
i
think
its
just
an
average
euro
pale
lager
the
flavors
were
mostly
corn
dry
grains
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
bread
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
moderate
overall
when
will
i
learn
to
stop
buying
these
run
of
the
mill
eurobeers
i
keep
hoping
that
one
day
im
going
to
find
a
diamond
in
the
rough
but
it
never
happens
i
made
it
through
the
can
but
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
o
pedestrian
macro
o
better
than
your
average
euro
pale
lager
but
there
is
nothing
really
that
interesting
about
it
picked
up
a
500ml
bottle
for
about
2
at
the
best
yet
grocery
in
astoria
after
the
initial
skunk
aroma
wafts
away

im
left
a
with
a
plan
slightly
sweet
lager
with
a
vague
hint
of
herbal
hops
and
toasted
barley
sure
its
bland
but
theres
nothing
offensive
here
probably
a
decent
beer
when
fresh
this
beer
pours
a
clear
fizzy
yellow
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
persists
and
then
leaves
lacing
on
the
glass
there
is
a
fine
stream
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
lightly
malty
with
aromatic
hops
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
has
some
nice
mild
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
some
light
malt
sweetness
kind
of
a
onedimensional
flavor
but
ok
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
overall
with
mediumlight
body
some
mild
hop
bitterness
lingers
in
the
finish
overall
a
drinkable
pilsner
lager
o
not
my
style
of
beer
overall
an
average
pilsnerstyle
beer
to
quench
a
thirst
and
forget
about
it
o
first
croatian
experience
im
pleased
a
little
nervous
for
the
taste
after
the
smell
but
it
pulled
through
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
full
of
unexpected
flavors
and
charm
if
this
is
the
fare
that
croatia
has
to
offer
then
this
is
one
reviewer
who
will
be
making
a
point
to
swing
by
the
next
time
he
goes
across
the
pond
pours
a
clear
yellowgold
with
a
2
inch
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
jagged
rings
of
lace
slowly
dissolve
into
random
spots
of
lace
around
the
glass
when
i
first
opened
this
beer
i
got
a
huge
whiff
of
skunk
upon
pouring
into
a
glass
the
only
smells
i
get
are
of
grains
and
some
grass
or
hay
notes
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
grain
and
grasshay
flavors
there
is
a
slightly
herbal
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
a
bit
flat
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
from
croatia
and
my
first
from
the
country
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
in
the
future
this
one
pours
a
watery
bright
gold
with
a
one
finger
head
it
smells
of
old
stale
pale
malts
no
crispness
a
severe
lack
of
anything
hop
related
its
blase
the
taste
is
infinitely
boring
it
doesnt
feature
any
complexity
its
old
pale
malts
and
thats
it
its
somewhat
stale
and
is
very
watery
it
just
isnt
good
in
any
aspect
and
doesnt
feature
anything
new
or
refreshing
noble
pils
kills
this
beer
in
a
head
to
head
it
isnt
worth
the
3
overall
reminds
me
a
bit
of
tyskie
gronie
with
bud
lights
dryness
and
golden
pheasants
sweetness
dthe
skunky
nose
and
unpleasant
taste
make
this
one
i
wont
try
again
dont
bottle
beer
in
green
bottles
overall
an
ok
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
searching
for
it
it
could
refresh
you
on
a
summers
day
had
this
beer
from
the
bottle
and
on
tap
while
on
vacation
in
croatia
decent
drinkability
overall
an
average
d
ok
nothing
to
get
excited
about
definitely
not
toilet
water
but
not
the
best
pilsner
i
could
easily
drink
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
nice
import
but
there
are
much
better
imports
and
pilseners
than
this
one
d
solid
average
and
down
the
middle
karlovacko
was
pale
gold
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
noble
hops
and
light
malt
the
taste
was
light
malt
with
a
little
noble
hop
flavor
the
finish
was
short
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
average
with
a
light
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
this
was
a
pretty
basic
pilsener
that
was
crisp
refreshing
and
boring
there
are
far
better
pilseners
out
there
dn
not
too
high
a
decent
beer
though
worth
a
try
just
dont
expect
to
much
honestly
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
in
this
one
once
the
unpleasantness
of
the
skunk
in
the
aroma
diminishes
the
beer
settles
down
to
something
drinkable
its
not
the
best
czech
style
pilsener
to
wet
my
lips
but
i
sat
back
and
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
d
okay
beer
would
rather
have
a
zatec
in
the
same
category
of
beer
poured
from
a
green
500
ml
bottle
pale
golden
color
with
pure
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
without
any
lacing
smell
is
the
fairly
standard
mild
skunk
smell
from
most
euro
lagers
from
a
green
bottle
taste
isnt
half
bad
average
but
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
have
another
one
d
one
is
good
enough
for
me
not
a
big
fan
in
general
but
it
is
always
nice
to
try
the
same
lager
from
other
countries
short
herbaceous
green
peppergreen
peppercorn
finish
not
bad
just
a
very
short
profile
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
three
fingers
of
white
head
it
is
pale
yellow
in
color
the
smell
is
like
the
grass
after
a
rain
i
also
sense
a
little
yeast
in
there
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
it
is
better
than
i
remember
it
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
if
your
into
this
style
i
just
am
turned
off
by
the
green
bottle
i
cant
get
over
my
prejudice
pours
a
pale
golden
with
a
decent
head
that
quickly
subsides
leaving
the
thinnest
layer
of
foam
very
little
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
has
grainy
notes
up
front
with
some
hops
and
vanilla
in
the
background
taste
is
alright
with
a
bit
more
tartness
than
i
expected
but
also
a
disappointing
lack
of
hops
presence
characteristic
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
okay
with
decent
carbonation
though
the
body
is
perhaps
a
bit
watery
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
really
my
idea
of
a
true
czech
pilsener
as
a
previous
reviewer
stated
this
beer
is
more
reminiscent
of
a
standard
euro
pale
lager
to
me
this
is
not
a
czech
pilsener
at
least
not
a
good
one
more
an
unexciting
euro
pale
lager
summary
nice
beer
closely
tracks
urquell
and
the
other
czech
pilsners
but
slightly
lighter
and
less
flavorful
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
cream
of
the
class
i
dont
think
this
is
an
amazing
beer
but
its
not
expensive
for
a
european
beer
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
bottle
is
so
cool
you
might
just
need
to
buy
it
overall
karlovacko
is
a
pleasant
beer
worth
the
price
there
is
nothing
particularly
special
about
it
but
at
the
same
time
one
cant
help
but
look
forward
to
drinking
a
few
bottles
of
it
with
some
good
food
good
for
washing
down
some
polish
sausage
or
for
a
game
of
checkers
on
the
patio
in
hot
weather
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
large
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
slight
hop
aroma
smooth
mouthfeel
a
bit
overcarbonated
with
clean
malt
and
slightly
predominant
hops
liquid
brass
sits
in
my
glass
lets
hear
some
snapping
from
the
peanut
gallery
for
my
poetry
slap
yeah
i
said
it
the
only
reason
i
can
distinguish
between
this
brew
and
say
a
french
horn
besides
the
clear
sonic
advantage
favoring
the
latter
is
the
stiff
quaff
of
white
foam
before
me
once
this
is
dissipated
a
steady
stream
of
bubbly
goodness
rises
from
the
base
a
deep
sniff
makes
me
question
why
i
even
continue
sampling
the
pilsners
and
aals
of
the
world
as
they
all
seem
to
smell
the
same
to
me
some
corn
syrup
some
toasted
rice
and
a
bit
of
wheat
nothing
offensive
nothing
impressive
the
tastes
are
also
very
similar
though
the
pilses
are
indeed
distinguishable
from
the
aals
with
a
firm
backbone
of
wheaty
rice
propping
up
a
vaguely
bitter
body
what
makes
me
less
derisive
toward
this
particular
brew
is
the
lack
of
a
sharp
tinniness
that
tends
to
pervade
other
pilsners
still
nothing
earthshattering
but
definitely
not
as
negative
as
the
rest
of
its
ilk
though
that
bubbly
jet
stream
continues
to
rise
like
one
of
those
bubble
walls
we
all
used
to
marvel
at
while
visited
sharper
image
as
children
the
carbonation
is
not
overtly
active
not
overly
fizzy
allowing
the
fairly
light
body
glide
sleekly
over
the
tongue
and
down
the
gullet
though
it
has
not
converted
me
into
a
smiling
clear
lager
drinker
it
has
shown
me
that
i
oughtnt
necessarily
judge
every
one
as
boring
before
i
try
it
and
that
croatia
is
coming
along
in
terms
of
beer
production
clear
lightish
golden
pour
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
after
a
pretty
aggressive
pour
out
of
out
of
a
500ml
brown
bottle
i
get
no
skunk
in
the
aroma
but
there
is
a
wet
grassstraw
scent
that
is
most
prominent
theres
a
floral
hint
that
id
attribute
to
the
hops
but
i
cant
really
sense
a
hop
presence
you
can
however
taste
the
hops
its
subtle
peppery
and
grassy
this
is
clean
and
refreshing
ive
always
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
again
not
much
to
say
here
this
is
just
another
mediocre
euro
lager
it
pours
clear
bright
yellow
gold
carbonation
is
a
bit
light
theres
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
aroma
and
finish
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
malt
is
relatively
clean
but
bland
its
just
too
similar
to
too
many
other
lagers
to
merit
much
discussion
drinkability
overall
not
too
bad
i
think
id
prefer
it
outdoors
in
hotter
climes
or
times
but
it
does
ok
even
in
the
winter
poured
from
a
green
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
on
the
skunky
side
taste
is
of
malts
slightly
sweet
and
finishing
a
bit
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
pretty
good
choice
bought
a
pint
single
at
surdyks
it
poured
a
dark
yellow
color
with
an
ok
head
and
lacing
not
your
typical
pils
color
the
smell
was
hops
and
sweet
floral
smells
i
also
detect
a
slght
earthy
smell
from
this
one
the
taste
was
not
as
crisp
and
floral
as
i
like
europils
to
be
it
had
slight
peat
taste
to
it
overall
its
not
a
bad
pils
but
ill
choose
budvar
or
golden
pheasant
over
this
one
when
the
beer
taste
bud
want
an
easy
drinking
europils
cheers
john
overall
id
rate
this
about
a
1
9
despite
my
above
response
i
poured
most
of
a
500
ml
karlovacko
pilsener
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
very
clear
yellow
and
had
a
fragile
one
finger
white
head
i
couldnt
get
much
out
of
the
aroma
not
even
your
typical
pils
smells
this
beer
tasted
sweet
but
had
little
other
flavor
rather
bland
it
was
light
bodied
and
had
adequate
carbonation
in
terms
of
drinkability
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
not
bad
but
summed
up
in
one
word
bland
oh
well
i
was
the
one
who
wanted
to
try
a
croatian
beer
overall
a
good
czech
pils
but
not
the
best
example
d
good
lager
quenching
some
interesting
notes
which
you
could
either
like
or
dislike
but
probably
not
in
between
the
finish
is
what
i
like
about
the
beer
it
is
on
the
dry
side
but
leaves
a
slighty
malty
finish
pours
pale
golden
fizzy
and
with
a
healthy
head
in
the
nose
its
grainy
and
with
a
whiff
of
adjuncts
tastes
very
light
grainy
and
perhaps
a
bit
corny
very
light
hops
not
terrible
but
not
all
that
exciting
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
grainy
and
soft
overall
this
is
okay
in
a
pinch
if
i
were
in
the
balkans
id
probably
be
fairly
pleased
to
find
this
at
a
restaurant
rather
than
some
other
terrible
eurolager
d
the
first
beer
i
had
from
the
balkans
but
the
czechs
make
far
better
czech
pilsener
than
the
boys
from
croatia
but
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
got
some
stiff
competition
in
the
style
this
is
worth
trying
and
a
pretty
good
offering
d
lacking
in
head
retention
this
beer
delivers
every
else
not
a
bad
brew
and
within
all
style
guidelines
d
a
real
nice
suprise
on
the
cheap
out
of
croatia
went
real
nicely
after
a
hour
of
shooting
hoops
d
not
good
definitely
a
drain
pour
d
i
just
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
while
not
bad
so
many
of
the
key
components
aroma
flavor
were
just
a
bit
off
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
yellow
very
clear
with
a
bit
of
white
head
the
aroma
reminds
me
very
much
of
heineken
very
much
a
bit
of
skunk
which
was
a
turn
off
the
flavor
wasnt
at
all
bad
no
skunk
there
is
some
breadygrainy
notes
along
with
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
and
enough
hop
bitterness
to
keep
the
beer
from
being
cloying
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
carbonation
mediumhigh
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
bit
of
flavor
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
no
this
is
not
a
very
good
czech
pilsner
and
not
a
good
beer
possibly
miscategorized
stick
with
golden
pheasant
or
pilsner
urquell
or
staropramen
for
a
czech
pils
if
i
didnt
hate
to
waste
beer
so
much
i
would
have
given
up
and
dumped
it
halfway
through
below
average
across
the
board
it
doesnt
kill
me
to
drink
euro
macros
but
this
might
be
the
least
worthy
ive
had
id
have
to
be
in
croatia
to
think
about
trying
this
again
d
high
drinkability
good
session
pilsner
could
drink
these
all
night
over
all
a
solid
pilsner
nikki
pours
a
golden
yellow
and
very
clear
has
a
thin
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
into
a
thin
collar
and
thinner
laciness
aroma
is
barley
and
malt
and
has
a
sweetness
in
the
background
taste
is
sweet
with
a
strong
barley
presence
mild
fruit
taste
decent
body
but
thin
texture
good
for
a
lager
not
what
i
expected
coming
from
europe
decent
overall
flavor
that
would
be
good
to
have
a
couple
around
the
house
not
my
first
choice
for
a
session
beer
d
if
there
wasnt
the
weird
metallic
flavor
this
beer
wouldnt
really
be
all
that
bad
taste
starts
decent
but
finishes
bad
maybe
fresh
it
would
be
better
the
green
bottle
never
been
a
fan
of
anything
produced
in
a
green
bottle
clear
golden
pilsner
with
carbonated
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
cleans
the
pallet
smooth
with
hints
of
alcohol
i
find
the
drinkability
higher
than
what
i
originally
thought
i
was
thinking
that
this
isnt
a
bad
standardish
epl
as
a
pils
its
lacking
but
still
not
bad
ill
say
it
lands
between
the
styles
in
any
case
it
has
a
bit
of
character
though
its
a
bit
too
sweetish
and
bland
overall
nothing
special
but
inoffensive
d
this
is
a
decent
enough
example
of
a
czech
style
pilsner
but
really
falls
more
into
a
macroeuro
lager
category
the
hops
arent
as
bright
as
perhaps
i
would
like
and
this
might
be
a
function
of
age
however
there
is
no
oxidation
noted
if
it
is
well
aged
which
is
a
credit
to
the
brewers
this
is
probably
really
good
fresher
and
closer
to
the
source
i
suppose
the
beerofthemonth
club
ran
out
of
worthwhile
things
to
import
picked
this
up
at
the
local
beer
store
for
2
60
500ml
bottle
a
light
golden
colorstark
white
head
that
quickly
fades
lots
of
carbonation
aroma
of
mild
hops
and
maybe
some
faint
apple
notes
flavor
of
mild
bitter
hops
and
a
tiny
caramel
note
i
really
liked
thisfor
a
pale
lager
it
was
very
gooddid
not
have
that
odd
baby
puke
aroma
that
some
pale
lagers
have
very
drinkable
raw
grainy
pale
malt
nose
with
a
certainly
mild
sweetness
smells
like
a
refreshing
pils
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
and
cereal
grain
like
husky
and
hully
light
hop
bitterness
to
the
very
clean
finish
overall
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
lightmedium
body
with
no
mention
of
alcohol
easy
to
drink
above
average
at
best
pours
a
pale
orange
color
with
yellow
highlights
decent
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
leaving
some
average
lacing
not
bad
for
the
appearance
aroma
of
some
grainy
husky
malts
and
decent
herbal
hop
aroma
not
skunky
in
the
least
flavor
is
where
things
go
downhill
a
bit
watered
down
some
husky
pale
malts
light
sweetness
and
a
below
average
hop
flavor
for
a
czech
style
pilsener
no
aftertaste
whatsoever
finish
is
incredibly
clean
there
a
slight
bite
at
the
end
but
the
flavor
is
just
lacking
medium
bodied
which
is
surprising
since
it
tastes
so
light
and
very
drinkable
this
stuff
goes
down
so
easy
its
almost
sad
that
it
has
no
flavor
i
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
because
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
croatia
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
any
time
soon
but
it
was
worth
the
shot
lightmedium
in
body
with
fine
crisp
carbonation
perfectly
refreshing
flavors
and
mouthfeel
to
compliment
a
sunny
afternoon
drinkability
is
pretty
good
on
a
warm
sunny
day
the
bottle
has
a
best
before
date
also
overall
this
is
a
very
good
lawnmower
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
a
little
more
malt
flavor
and
complexity
than
the
average
pils
the
lack
of
hop
balance
is
made
up
for
by
the
high
carbonation
lending
this
one
a
good
overall
impression
on
the
palate
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
just
so
many
others
out
there
which
are
far
better
d
average
drinkability
a
nice
start
is
hindered
by
a
lack
of
aroma
but
fairs
better
with
the
finish
uneventful
at
times
but
still
one
that
can
be
mindlessly
put
back
on
a
sunday
afternoon
well
since
i
needed
a
beer
from
croatia
i
decided
to
grab
a
sixer
truth
be
told
i
had
been
considering
purchasing
this
for
a
while
and
finally
decided
to
since
pickings
were
slim
at
the
grocery
store
aroma
is
faint
and
consists
primarily
of
nothing
not
offensive
but
far
from
appealing
pours
a
straw
golden
into
my
glass
with
a
quickly
diminishing
head
and
some
sticky
lacing
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
slightly
creamy
with
a
good
finish
and
pleasant
aftertaste
the
flavor
is
also
solid
nothing
spectacular
in
a
sense
it
is
typical
euro
lager
that
is
slightly
more
mellow
than
say
grolsch
or
heinekin
i
enjoy
the
taste
but
overall
par
at
best
bham
uk
medium
gold
white
head
with
little
retention
very
little
lacing
early
smell
is
grassy
taste
is
clean
grain
crackerlike
bitter
spice
on
the
finish
medium
body
dry
texture
moderate
carbonation
pretty
much
a
typical
europeanstyle
pilsner
without
the
stink
not
bad
i
guess
but
then
again
i
dont
really
care
for
this
style
and
probably
wont
have
it
again
d
a
supersession
beer
for
the
great
spring
weather
i
could
totally
see
dropping
a
few
of
these
down
the
gullet
at
a
backyard
summer
bbq
ill
bet
its
great
with
brats
since
it
would
compliment
the
greasy
and
heavy
fatty
flavors
with
a
crisp
freshness
d
a
six
pack
a
day
will
keep
dr
blues
away
doooodes
its
reasonably
easy
to
drink
and
reasonably
unoffensive
its
not
a
great
beer
though
and
id
be
loath
to
call
it
an
above
average
pilsstyle
lager
dont
count
on
winning
too
many
more
medals
guys
d
it
was
a
decent
and
easy
to
drink
pilsener
that
would
make
a
great
session
brew
d
a
pretty
standard
mediterranean
lager
apropo
to
the
climate
its
a
good
poolside
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
fairly
clean
and
the
drinkability
is
fine
a
few
of
these
would
be
fine
if
this
is
all
you
can
find
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
or
seek
out
while
camping
in
croatia
not
many
beers
other
than
karlovacko
where
available
in
the
nearby
shops
its
nothing
special
but
its
surely
better
than
nothing
after
a
hot
day
of
climbing
and
sun
it
was
nice
to
crack
a
few
of
these
and
feel
refreshedwhile
watching
the
sun
drop
on
the
horizon
definitely
not
a
great
beer
but
perfect
for
its
situation
this
beer
pours
a
clear
strawgold
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
faint
hint
of
biscuity
malt
but
mostly
it
is
of
nothing
the
taste
is
has
little
more
of
the
biscuity
malt
than
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
some
very
mild
noble
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
at
best
its
not
so
bad
that
i
cant
finish
one
bottle
but
it
isnt
good
enough
to
rink
again
i
found
this
one
a
typical
central
european
lager
with
a
czech
twist
pours
a
clear
gold
that
holds
almost
no
head
after
a
few
seconds
nose
is
slightly
cereal
sweet
bitter
acrid
tone
to
it
slight
fruity
tone
to
it
man
this
tastes
funny
i
want
to
say
it
almost
tastes
like
apple
juice
beer
which
is
interesting
on
the
first
sip
then
the
whole
flavor
profile
just
jumps
off
the
edge
of
the
cliff
turns
bitter
and
metallic
and
has
no
good
quality
to
it
really
feel
is
standard
with
minimal
carbonation
i
doubt
i
am
going
to
get
through
this
whole
thing
so
bland
so
just
so
not
that
worth
drinking
oh
well
add
another
country
to
the
list
d
a
basic
uncomplex
lager
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
a
few
of
these
would
go
down
without
a
problem
again
if
this
is
a
pilsner
then
it
is
all
wrong
but
if
that
is
a
misprint
it
is
still
not
a
very
good
beer
but
drinkable
pours
a
clear
solid
gold
under
a
shortlived
one
finger
white
head
that
left
exactly
one
spot
of
lace
before
disappearing
quickly
the
nose
is
reasonably
strong
of
grain
perhaps
corn
but
not
at
all
unpleasant
the
mouth
is
fairly
chewy
and
reasonably
well
carbonated
a
decent
solid
taste
with
plenty
of
bready
grain
but
not
much
on
the
hops
side
i
suppose
this
would
be
ok
as
a
quaffer
on
a
hot
summer
day
itll
do
d
an
average
pils
flavor
nothing
to
write
home
about
basic
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
great
i
would
drink
this
again
but
probably
not
seek
it
out
pours
a
clear
golden
one
finger
head
but
not
much
retentionor
lacing
aroma
is
of
faint
yeastand
malts
weak
at
best
body
is
thin
and
watery
with
some
carbionation
taste
is
sweetand
bready
with
a
honey
edge
that
is
not
unpleasent
not
my
favorite
stylebut
if
its
yoursgive
it
a
try
served
up
at
the
beachwood
ballroom
in
cleveland
oh
pale
gold
with
a
white
head
that
disappears
right
away
aroma
is
faintly
skunky
containing
noble
hops
grainy
with
some
citrus
flavor
is
pretty
on
par
with
your
typical
euro
lager
pale
dull
and
light
this
one
is
perhaps
a
touch
hoppier
then
the
average
light
crisp
and
fairly
clean
body
drinkable
but
not
exciting
still
this
is
from
croatia
ancestral
home
of
one
of
my
great
grandfathers
and
current
home
to
my
excommissar
cousin
so
this
beer
gets
a
bonus
for
that
try
it
eye
catching
gold
in
color
but
the
head
is
lackluster
this
is
a
pretty
standard
pilsner
sort
of
sweet
broken
by
the
hops
and
hay
flavors
good
crisp
feel
on
the
tongue
drinkablilty
is
okay
as
it
sometimes
tasted
rusty
worth
sampling
once
or
twice
i
already
have
lite
aroma
of
steamed
veggies
along
with
a
barely
discernable
note
of
the
euro
yeast
skunk
soft
malts
along
with
a
nice
hop
hit
at
the
finish
crisp
and
dry
i
could
drink
several
at
a
session
glad
i
tried
it
not
bad
and
made
up
for
an
otherwise
boring
evening
this
bottle
came
from
a
brew
of
the
month
club
and
is
a
bit
old
but
no
sediment
just
saw
online
today
that
the
brewery
may
be
temporarily
closed
for
possible
improper
hazzardous
waste
disposal
anyway
this
poured
with
a
nice
head
that
promptly
settled
down
no
lace
nice
golden
amber
color
aroma
of
grain
grass
light
malt
mild
spice
and
some
hop
flavor
is
distictly
sweet
decent
body
short
finish
drinkable
beer
d
this
brew
has
it
going
on
never
had
a
czech
pilsner
before
and
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
style
then
ill
be
seeking
out
more
of
these
pours
light
golden
straw
with
perfect
clarity
a
fizzy
threefinger
head
slowly
gives
way
to
a
rocky
soap
bubble
cap
that
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
pilsener
malt
and
some
toasty
biscuit
aromas
background
noble
hops
and
a
faint
fruit
scent
the
pilsener
malt
flavor
is
sweet
at
first
with
subtle
layers
of
toasted
nut
and
light
caramel
flavors
this
gives
way
to
the
more
typical
sharp
pils
taste
a
very
mild
saaz
or
tettnanger
flavor
and
lacking
bitterness
are
found
in
the
aftertastebut
at
least
its
not
skunked
lighter
body
with
some
decoctionesque
malty
texture
and
medium
light
carbonation
make
a
slightly
crisp
and
mellow
mouthfeel
finishes
with
traces
of
spicy
german
hops
and
a
kiss
of
toasted
pils
sweetness
honestly
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
albiet
lackluster
example
of
the
style
i
bought
it
for
the
novelty
of
being
croastian
beer
but
i
would
be
disappointed
if
i
were
expecting
an
authentic
czech
pils
on
the
other
hand
its
very
affordable
highly
drinkable
and
could
easily
be
passed
off
as
a
really
great
macro
an
ideal
choice
for
introducing
craft
beer
to
nonenthusiasts
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
this
is
up
there
in
score
simply
because
it
very
easy
to
drink
i
doubt
that
anyone
would
be
offended
by
the
tastefeel
of
this
beer
unless
they
were
expecting
something
more
a
good
example
of
the
classic
pilsner
style
would
definitely
not
pass
up
a
bottle
of
this
were
i
offered
one
drink
d
very
easy
to
session
not
at
all
offensive
nothing
special
either
easy
drinking
easy
forgettin
notes
ive
had
better
in
the
style
but
this
is
at
least
in
the
same
ballpark
as
some
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
i
could
session
this
with
ease
hits
all
the
marks
solid
this
was
part
of
a
beers
around
the
world
pack
i
recieved
from
a
friend
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
w
this
offering
d
not
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
it
lacked
a
lot
of
features
i
find
undesirable
in
other
eastern
european
pilsners
id
drink
it
again
taste
is
fairly
malt
dominatted
for
a
pilsner
but
fairly
inoffensive
unfortunately
the
texture
is
limp
and
lifeless
with
little
crispness
or
hop
bite
in
the
aftertaste
far
too
watery
to
be
satisfying
and
too
impotent
to
be
refreshing
this
beer
is
inconsistent
and
not
really
worth
your
time
unless
you
just
want
to
try
a
croatian
beer
like
i
did
one
is
enough
seeing
as
it
has
a
substantial
corn
component
it
probably
has
more
charcter
than
expected
its
no
wonder
the
glass
was
so
small
one
can
only
take
so
much
of
this
swill
at
once
i
am
croatian
and
this
beverage
is
drank
more
than
water
in
my
family
trying
to
hide
my
biast
this
is
an
average
pilsner
at
best
i
believe
it
was
recently
purchased
by
a
larger
brewer
maybe
heiniken
and
this
is
a
good
thing
because
this
beer
was
easily
spoiled
in
the
past
the
pasteurization
must
have
improved
because
rarely
is
a
spoiled
one
found
now
the
overall
taste
has
a
bit
of
bitter
crispness
to
it
but
generally
bland
overall
this
is
a
great
lawnmower
or
summertime
beer
when
your
looking
to
throw
some
back
and
not
worry
about
how
many
you
drank
mouthfeel
is
moderate
not
thin
not
rich
but
with
the
flavor
i
just
could
not
finish
this
one
this
was
a
decent
beer
pretty
simple
and
straight
forward
while
it
is
certainly
drinkable
it
is
also
in
my
opinion
somewhat
forgetable
nothing
really
stood
out
while
drinking
this
beer
certainly
a
bit
better
than
the
american
alternatives
but
still
nothing
to
get
excited
about
fairly
nice
looking
clear
yellowy
pour
with
a
1
finger
white
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
faint
scent
of
honey
in
the
nose
that
honey
scent
is
a
much
stronger
honey
flavor
on
the
tongue
it
might
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
some
but
i
liked
it
just
fine
not
a
huge
mouthfeel
though
pretty
darn
drinkable
if
you
like
honey
which
i
do
this
would
be
a
great
dessert
after
a
lunch
of
fish
and
chips
by
the
beach
on
a
sunny
day
11
15oz
bottle
this
pours
a
clear
golden
color
mine
had
minimal
head
even
though
there
was
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
is
actually
pretty
decent
there
is
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
malt
sweetness
to
the
beer
the
taste
is
not
as
good
as
the
aroma
it
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
mild
malt
flavor
it
doesnt
taste
light
however
definitely
lacking
in
the
hops
department
i
suppose
this
would
be
good
if
i
were
in
croatia
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
one
here
except
to
add
another
country
to
the
list
pretty
much
a
run
of
the
mill
pilsener
not
enough
malt
spine
and
the
hops
lacks
some
bite
both
of
which
would
make
this
better
allinall
its
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
either

better
than
i
expected
but
much
like
a
typical
macro

taste
is

it
you
would

12oz
bottle
poured
out
a
golden
yellow
color
lots
of
bubbles
and
very
little
head
it
smelled
a
bit
like
corn
and
a
little
like
hops
the
corn
flavor
came
through
while
drinking
it
but
there
was
no
real
overpowering
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
good
it
was
pretty
light
so
id
say
it
is
very
drinkable
mouth
it
enters
sweet
and
a
bit
chewy
and
follows
with
a
bitter
swallow
i
like
the
high
carbonation
do
i
see
a
trend
here
but
theres
absolutely
no
depth
to
the
flavor
the
beer
is
completely
gone
from
the
mouth
no
more
than
5
seconds
after
being
swallowed
except
for
a
nasty
metallic
aftertaste
that
doesnt
seem
like
it
should
be
coming
from
a
bottle
overall
not
one
i
like
at
all
wasnt
even
an
average
lager
muchless
a
pils
pass
this
on
up
but
the
metaalic
did
affect
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
the
carbonation
was
not
up
to
par
for
my
pilsners
not
as
crisp
or
refreshing
clear

bitterness
balanced
to
the
sweet
side
with

aroma
apart
from
some
adjunct
graininess
and
a
faint
floral
note

two
taste
is
not
very
pronounced
not
offensive
just
light
and
sweet
little
body
and
no
finish
to
speak
of
might
do
well
if
served
on
a
hot
day
as
a
quencher
before
you
drink
something
nicer
this
looks
like
your
average
european
lager
bright
yellow
smell
is
alright
some
hops
no
skunk
which
is
a
bonus
taste
is
surprisingly
good
clean
and
refreshing
not
overly
sweet
and
not
overly
bitter
this
is
well
carbonated
but
overdone
which
makes
the
mouthfeel
pretty
unoffensive
this
beer
is
a
great
macroalternative
and
makes
for
a
good
bbq
beer
for
sure
prehaps
this
beer
tastes
better
on
tap
in
croatia
but
the
kind
imported
was
only
a
bit
different
from
dollar
beers
such
as
carling
the
pour
is
pale
gold
with
a
head
that
starts
out
appropriately
large
but
disappears
altogether
the
nose
is
grassy
hops
muted
as
they
might
be
this
straddles
the
fence
between
a
europeanmacro
lager
and
a
czech
pilsner
its
got
crisp
grassy
saaz
hops
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
herbs
theres
just
not
much
of
any
of
it
the
mouthfeel
is
average
so
is
drinkability
this
stuff
is
a
little
bit
better
then
a
novelty
beer
from
an
exotic
eastern
european
country
although
its
nothing
exciting
everything
about
this
beer
is
on
the
light
side
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
certainly
nothing
exciting
about
it
either
very
easy
to
drink
but
so
is

its

not
quite

thinnothing
really
stands
out
flavor
wise
except
for
a
fruity
finish
it
just
seems
to
go
down
with
not
much
flavor
till
a
burst
of
fruit
hits
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
well
iam
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
croatian
brew
that
goes
down
easly
but
with
no
frills
drinkability
so
many
beers
are
like
this
why
pick
this
one
maybe
if
you
want
to
check
croatia
off
of
your
countries

this
is
an
enjoyable
and
well

no

a
great
creature
feature
being
croatian
i
grew
up
with
this
beer
a
staple
at
all
croatian
soccer
games
and
post
game
celebrations
hoppy
flavour
with
just
the
right
malt
undertones
the
appearance
is
nothing
to
gawk
at
but
you
will
be
rewarded
upon
finishing
a
bottle
of
this
pilsener
perfectly
balanced
beer
that
could
be
made
better
by
removing
some
of
the
carbonation
otherwise
it
is
a
must
try
and
enjoy
number
six
in
the
10
new
bland
commie
lagers
at
the
lcbo
this
ones
pour
is
a
little
more
on
the
gold
side
of
pale
straw
but
the
same
crystal
clear
fizzy
cap
vanishing
character
as
most
of
em
vague
light
malt
sweetness
and
some
spice
and
medicinal
grassy
hops
same
fizzy
bland
watery
mouth
feel
and
mild
malthop
mix
5
of
these
type
of
fizzy
vapid
commercial
slavic
lagers
is
all
i
can
take
quick
a
porter
so
i
can
confirm
i
still
have
taste
buds
i
would
pass
on
this
beer
again
there
is
really
nothing
that
distinguishes
it
from
other
international
macro
lagers
this
beer
seemed
rather
lifeless
and
ordinary
to
me
there
are
quite
a
few
good
beers
to
be
found
in
eastern
europe
but
this
isnt
one
of
the
better
ones
bottle
poured
a
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
nice
white
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
aroma
is
quite
weak
but
some
malt
can
be
detected
taste
is
quite
not
enough
crisp
with
some
malt
that
can
be
detected
and
some
very
light
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
i
would
classified
this
as
a
better
then
average
lager
without
any
skunk
taste
from
the
bottle
which
is
a
major
accomplishment
this
brew
is
a
fairly
dark
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
topping
it
off
clean
malt
scent
touch
of
hops
grainy
malt
taste
some
bitter
hops
rounding
out
the
back
this
is
a
pretty
dry
drink
this
certainly
isnt
the
worst
beer
but
it
is
pretty
standard
for
the
category
ok
this
beer
pretty
well
sucks
as
red
cap
tastes
better
and
i
didnt
exactly
laud
that
brew
i
expected
some
semblance
of
taste
and
was
given
a
vacuum
that
sucked
all
flavour
out
this
beer
for
sweet
jesus
arent
all
eastern
european
beers
at
least
supposed
to
taste
like
something
those
poor
croatians
are
subjected
to
this
poor
excuse
for
a
lager
not
bad
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
mine
said
draught
perhaps
i
should
list
it
as
a
new
beer
as
the
bottle
is
different
unoffensive
though
not
creamy
mild
bitterness
citrus
floral
theres
hops
in
there
golden
yellow
with
nice
white
foam
a
bit
sweet
and
fruity
neutral
fine
with
lunch
ive
had
worse
pils
a
bulbous
creamy
white
head
sits
atop
a
light
golden
pils
with
little
carbonation
mose
is
mostly
gas
malt
lingers
in
the
background
taste
holds
not
much
flavor
bailey
perceivable
malt
this
would
be
a
great
lawnmower
beer
mouth
is
smooth
but
a
little
watery
i
had
this
one
in
croatia
after
a
day
at
the
beach
and
it
hit
the
spot
for
that
moment
just
enough
flavor
to
make
it
refreshing
on
a
hot
august
day
there
were
mild
hops
and
malt
the
glass
was
laced
nicely
at
the
end
and
the
color
was
a
beautiful
golden
that
refracted
the
sun
nicely
if
you
held
it
up
right
it
was
a
good
pilsner
certainly
better
than
most
of
the
beers
passing
themselves
off
as
pilsners
in
america
i
also
found
it
very
drinkable
later
that
evening
as
i
enjoyed
several
more
drinkability
great
i
felt
like
drinking
more
i
will
purchase
this
one
again
very
drinkable
i
will
buy
this
again
a
pretty
good
pilsner
beer
interesting
with
the
herbal
hop
flavor
i
just
recently
saw
this
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
and
ill
certainly
get
it
again
a
great
beer
for
damp
summer
heat
the
quintessential
lager
translucent
golden
yellow
on
the
pour
with
the
head
large
and
spumescent
the
color
a
bright
white
and
the
residual
lace
a
sealing
sheet
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
citrus
crisp
malt
sweet
clean
and
pleasant
with
the
start
cloyingly
sweet
modest
malt
profile
and
the
top
cadaverous
finish
is
meekly
acidic
the
hops
sparse
and
lacking
any
real
bite
dry
aftertaste
pale
golden
in
color
thin
white
head
in
the
straightsided
pint
glass
spicy
hop
aroma
with
a
decent
malt
backup
rather
lackluster
mineral
content
in
the
finish
yet
very
clean
like
a
czech
pils
the
hops
seem
to
be
the
best
part
of
this
beer
im
just
someone
that
can
appreciate
an
good
eastern
european
hop
this
one
delivers
if
youre
looking
for
a
germanczech
lager
meld
better
than
i
was
expecting
though
certainly
not
a
pilsner
urquellczechvar
this
doesnt
completely
disappoint
and
this
is
one
id
possibly
have
again
my
first
beer
from
croatia
and
it
was
very
mediocre
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
that
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
was
bitter
with
some
strong
grassy
notes
the
flavor
was
average
this
pilsner
is
crisp
but
unrefreshing
it
has
a
sharp
bitterness
and
slightly
thickerbody
on
the
tongue
the
bitterness
last
long
into
the
aftertaste
this
is
not
a
pampered
beer
this
is
one
that
has
been
working
60
hour
weeks
in
a
factory
since
it
was
6
years
old
a
factory
where
the
lunch
room
is
a
mess
and
the
employees
grumble
out
loud
in
a
foreign
language
gritty
greasy
factotum
lager
well
it
comes
in
a
nice
big
bottle
so
theres
lots
of
it
to
drink
if
thats
your
objkective
otherwise
id
give
it
a
pass
a
pleasant
surprise
here
certainly
nota
geat
beer
but
much
more
drinkable
than
i
suspected
after
numerous
eurolagers
and
pilsners
the
past
couple
of
days
pours
a
nice
golden
colour
with
a
strong
head
that
dissolves
into
a
lasting
lace
no
skunkiness
here
largely
thanks
to
the
choice
of
a
brown
bottle
over
a
green
one
most
likely
smells
of
grain
and
malt
and
the
taste
is
just
that
a
bit
watery
but
not
coronaesque
watery
a
pleasantly
smooth
brew
that
has
a
bit
less
carbonation
than
a
standard
pilsner
again
not
spectacular
but
certainly
drinkable
okay
the
folks
over
in
croatia
need
to
pay
attention
to
what
the
folks
over
poland
or
czech
are
doing
because
this
brew
leaves
much
to
be
desired
poured
as
i
expected
a
light
straw
color
with
a
massive
amount
of
carbonation
smell
is
pungent
grassy
and
earthy
taste
is
watery
muddy
when
combined
with
the
pungent
nose
you
get
with
each
sip
makes
for
a
truly
unpleasant
drinking
experience
came
in
a
brown
500ml
bottle
with

stamped
on

label
is
an
average
clear

hue
big
white
head
upon
pour
that
recedes
to
a
thin
ring
smells
of
very
light
malt
and
metal
metallic
flavour
is
most
predominant
as
well
a
bit
of
graininess
its
pretty
dry
though
aftertaste
of
iron
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
watery
actually
my
mouth
tastes
like
i
just
sucked
on
some
loose
change
ill
be
passing
on
this
stuff
next
time
the
taste
started
out
a
bit
hoppy
became
sweet
but
finished
a
bit
dry
with
just
a
hint
of
herbal
bitterness
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
effort
on
this
beer
but
it
seems
atypical
for
a
pilsener
style
lager
because
of
the
lack
of
clarity
not
bad
at
all
not
great
but
definitely
above
average
and
worth
trying

dropping
to
a
thin
collar
that
leaves
some
thin

standard
sized
bubbles
rise
steadily
towards
the
surface
the
nose
expresses
a
clean
and
sweetly
grainy
maltiness
thats
backed
by
mild
floral
and
spicy

the
body
is
distinctly
medium

the
aroma

thats
lightly
sweet
but
well
infused
with
gentle
floral

flavor
and
backed
by
a

overall
a
pretty
average
european
lager
although
its
clean
and
unskunked
clear
yellow
in
color
with
a
proud
fluffy
white

unfortunately
the
aroma
department
yields
up
nothing
dry

vegetal
nothing
else
body
is
light
texture
has
some
small
graininess
in
it
and
a
truly
cloying
sweetness
pervades
the
lasting
finish
ultimately
a
lack
of
flavor
and
overwhelming
blandness
is
the
hallmark
of
this
lager

poured
a
light

a
perfectly
white
head
that
settled
into
a
thin
lace
it
did
have
a
touch
of
skunk
at
first
but
after
letting
set
for
a
minute
it
faded
and
the
beer
had
no
real
aroma
maybe
it
was
just
the
bottle
i
had
but
the
beer
felt
very
flat
in
my
mouth
it
was
also
difficult
to
decern
specific
flavors
in
this
beer
it
just
seemed
very
sweet
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
is
a
sweeter

budweiser

was

simply

is

well
as
was

with
the
crisp

aftertaste
its
a

time

feel
ehh
ok
too
light
for

great

excellent

and
has
a
great

recommended
a
drinkable
pilsner
good
on
a
summer
day
can
taste
pilsner
hops
a
decent
pils
but
has
too
much
of
a
grainy
flavor
and
the
body
is
a
bit
watery
a
pretty
average
pilsner
id
say
subpar
for
new
belgium
refreshing
and
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
but
pretty
low
on
flavor
andor
character
the
light
hop
scared
my
bud
drinking
relatives
i
think
it
is
a
nice
lawn
mower
beer
this
is
a
crisp
dry
refreshing
brew
the
way
pilsner
ought
to
be
particularly
nice
for
summer
but
id
drink
it
yearround
the
crack
was
made
difficult
by
the
dent
and
really
i
was
lucky
it
did
not
explode
on
impact
a
bottle
would
surely
have
shattered
from
that
height
speaking
of
height
it
also
made
it
impossible
to
tell
just
how
full
the
can
actually
was
i
gave
it
an
inverted
glug
to
get
things
started
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
long
time
i
got
some
overfoaming
the
result
was
twoplus
fingers
of
dense

presence
my
mouth
began
to
water
in
the
meantime
lacing
had
begun
to
appear
as
the
head
subsided
mouthfeel
was
soft
not
thin
not
watery
but
simply
soft
i
was
really
digging
the
way
that
the
hops
were
first
and
foremost
which
is
the
hallmark
of
the
czech
pils
style
i
can
get
behind
german
pilseners
but
they
do
not
trip
my
trigger
like
a
good
czech
pils
i
mean
although
i
dig
czech
women
also
the
grassy
bitterness
is
such
a
treat
and
this
style
is
what
made
me
realize
that
i
can
enjoy
lagers
as
a
hophead
especially
after
so
many
canned
aals
finish
was
semidry
not
quite
as
biting
as
some
that
i

had

very

in

there
are
so
many
other
better
craft
pilsners
out
on
the
market
so
its
doubtful
ill
ever
feel
the
need
to
buy
this
again
o
possibly
new
belgiums
most
bland
beer
its
not
bad
of
course
but
it
just
lacks
character
i
like
the
hop
bite
but
its
not
enough
it
has
a
noticeable
toasted
malt
base
but
its
just
not
enough
there
is
a
slight
lemon
hint
but
its
not

to
call
it
a
note
of
citrus
mediocre
b
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
pils
is
the
hardest
style
to
describe
for
me
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
over
the
top
but
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
it
again
this
is
a
good
pilsner
its
not
mind
blowing
or
even
worth
getting
again
but
its
good
the
taste
matches
the
smell
and
the
taste
is
sweet
and
really
enjoyable
light
lemony
bread
its
a
very
good

with

with
each
sip
very
surprised
of
the
amount
actually
the
aroma
is
of
mildly
crisp
and
grainy
pale
malt
lemon
and
earthy
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
of
grassy
hops
pale
malt
biscuit
and
lemon
very
crisp
with
good
carbonation
goes
down
easy
and
very
drinkable
a
good
brew
from
the
fat
tire
folks
blue
paddle
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
very
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
pale
straw
like
aroma
very
weak
the
taste
is
crisp
light
good
pale
malt
backbone
nice
flavors
stronger
then
others
but
weak
aftertaste
overall
its
a
very
nice
pils
an
adequate
and
capable
oldschool
pilsener
a
bit
soft
around
the
edges
yet
more
or
less
drinkable
and
duly
thirstquenching
a
pleasant
start
to
this
cornucopia
of
a
beer
experience
i
have
ahead
of
me
this
evening
overall
ok
not
sure
that
i
would
buy
another
6pack
of
this
one
a
clean
well
lagered
beer
overall
im
tempted
to
say
something
about
the
strange
contrast
between
the
excellence
of
new
belgiums
american
and
now
bohemian
styles
and
the
general
mediocrity
of
their
belgian
style
offerings
but
thats
beyond
the
scope
of
this
review
o
nice
bitterness
for
a
pilsener
uncomplex
refreshing
o
i
often
detect
mineral
notes
in
lagers
and
count
it
against
the
experience
but
here
i
dont
mind
it
its
a
bit
more
subtle
and
balanced
by
other
qualities
and
a
good
crispness
overall
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
the
pieces
on
their
own
arent
anything
to
brag
about
but
put
together
it
turns
into
a
great
hot
weather
session
beer
decently
hopped
just
not
especially
tasty
in
a
can
i
would
like
this
for
boating
or
camping
d
pleasant
warm
day
beer
boy
this
drinks
nicely
and
easily
not
as
robust
as
some
but
a
nice
drinker
on
a
summer
evening
o
as
with
many
new
belgium
beers
i
get
the
impression
this
one
is
brewed
for
the
crossover
drinker
and
while
it
is
clearly
a
step
up
from
the
american
adjunct
lager
it
is
also
clearly
brewed
with
a
heavy
dose
of
restraint
certainly
drinkable
but
nothing
too
exciting
either
c
o
is
this
a
great
beer
no
but
a
refreshing
one
that
feels
right
considering
it
is
80
degrees
outside
theres
a
light
but
sharp
aroma
thats
equal
parts
lemony
and
grassy
with
a
hint
of
toast
hidden
in
the
back
the
flavor
is
light
and
crisp
with
the
touch
of
lemon
and
grass
on
it
its
lightly
bitter
but
just
enough
to
give
it
some
character
with
a
nice
finish
i
liked
this
one
more
than
i
had
expected
to
final
thoughts
a
well
made
pilsner
that
will
probably
impress
your
bmc
friends
as
a
hop
head
id
love
to
see
a
version
of
this
beer
that
uses
the
same
malt
base
with
some
west
coast
hops
that
would
be
a
beer
that
could
turn
some
heads
for
now
though
blue
paddle
is
a
drinkerfriendly
and
enjoyable
take
on
a
classic
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
its
a
nice
looking
beer
clear
gold
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
laces
down
the
glass
it
smells
like
a
typical
pilsner
sweet
honey
malts
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hop
maybe
a
little
waxy
in
the
aroma
the
spicy
hop
jumps
out
at
first
with
grassy
flavor
and
then
the
beer
finishes
with
some
grassy
and
floral
hop
and
sweet
malt
finish
has
a
nice
spicy
bitter
bite
overall
a
good
pilsner
just
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
would
never
try
it
again
othis
is
a
good
looking
beer
but
there
are
certainly
bettertasting
pils
out
there
this
one
errs
on
the
side
of
light
and
refreshing
maybe
a
good
pool
beergolf
beer
but
even
assuming
that
light
and
refreshing
was
the
goal
i
could
use
a
little
more
taste
and
body
here
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
slight
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
for
some
reason
ive
always
shied
away
from
new
belgium
beers
with
the
exception
of
their
1554
black
ale
and
that
prejudice
has
been
to
my
detriment
based
on
this
sampling
this
pilsner
is
one
of
the
best
ive
experienced
in
a
long
time
the
beer
is
nothing
but
clean
sweet
and
delicate
with
plenty
of
lager
character
wellbalanced
with
a
pleasant
subtle
complexity
that
is
nothing
but
enjoyable
from
every
angle
i
will
be
coming
back
to
this
one
poured
this
czech
style
pilsener
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
golden
color
produced
a
nice
off
white
head
nice
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
pale
malt
and
citrus
light
in
body
base
of
sweet
malted
grain
floral
hops
and
lemon
citrus
overall
this
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
nice
session
beer
not
very
complex
but
its
worth
a
try
overall
a
fairly
standard
pilsener
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
while
grilling
some
burgers
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
big
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
tons
of
lacing
as
the
beer
passes
through
the
glass
aromas
of
of
freshly
cut
grass
taste
is
a
citrus
peel
beginning
followed
by
some
light
crackers
then
an
herbal
zesty
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
nice
pilsner
easy
drinking
but
not
dumbed
down
oi
bought
a
6
pack
of
this
with
out
ever
having
it
before
im
glad
i
did
its
very
tasty
its
a
quality
lager
i
really
dont
know
what
else
to
say
besides
go
out
and
try
this
please
its
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
ever
had
pours
out
clear
like
any
other
pilsner
clear
with
a
golden
hue
the
aroma
of
the
noble
hops
emerges
out
as
the
most
pungent
aroma
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
the
clears
there
is
only
a
light
and
slight
bitternes
to
this
beer
very
good
american
interpurtation
of
a
czech
pilsner
where
most
american
craft
beers
are
going
for
fruitful
beers
3
385

pretty
average
except
for
the
smell
good
for
a
summer
day
overall
unfortunately
im
not
too
excited
about
this
one
i
was
looking
for
a
good
goto
pilsner
to
replace
my
sierra
nevada
summerfest
when
it
goes
out
of
season
and
im
afraid
the
blue
paddle
just
isnt
it
yeah
this
isnt
the
most
intriguing
beer
on
the
planet
but
its
a
worthwhile
summer
sipper
it
smells
as
german
as
it
does
czech
on
the
malt
profile
dusty
and
dry
sturdy
but
light
enough
to
be
easy
drinking
the
hops
enter
a
little
bit
in
the
flavor
but
its
only
in
the
finish
and
very
subdued
this
is
a
straight
up
pils
more
robust
than
is
traditional
but
its
not
a
beer
for
hop
heads
the
finish
is
dry
after
just
a
second
and
a
certain
thirst
quenching
element
is
there
thankfully
it
feels
a
little
filling
to
me
maybe
a
little
heavier
in
body
than
most
beers
from
this
genre
but
the
carbonation
is
good
and
its
an
easy
6pack
on
a
late
summer
afternoon
no
complaints
with
this
it
just
isnt
getting
me
off
ya
know
o
a
pleasant
pilsener
id
drink
another
one
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
so
maybe
it
just
is
personal
taste
o
if
i
could
id
give
this
a
3
25
the
hollowness
spoils
what
would
be
an
otherwise
stellar
czech
pilsener
nonetheless
this
is
better
than
average
overallthis
pilsner
is
a
great
sessionable
brew
to
enjoy
during
the
remaining
summer
months
i
have
to
admit
i
have
tried
better
pilsners
however
this
is
a
solidly
good
brew
cheers
overall
a
well
done
pilsner
great
after
a
hot
and
laborous
day
blue
paddle
is
a
simple
no
frills
pilsener
looks
how
youd
expect
smells
like
youd
expect
tastes
like
youd
expect
etc
the
good
news
is
that
it
works
just
fine
its
full
flavored
even
if
its
elements
are
simple
i
took
a
six
pack
of
this
out
to
lake
tahoe
and
had
several
while
barbequeing
and
felt
it
was
perfect
for
the
time
o
blue
paddle
is
a
relatively
barebones
simple
beer
but
certainly
not
without
flavor
this
delectable
incredibly
refreshing
beer
is
a
quintessential
summer
session
beer
gently
offering
bitterness
and
hop
characteristics
of
a
cleanly
lagered
pilsner
something
a
hophead
who
doesnt
want
to
get
bashed
across
the
face
with
resin
would
really
dig
blue
paddle
is
incredibly
welldone
a
well
done
czech
pilsner
easy
drinking
light
but
flavorful
poured
a
clear
pale
straw
with
a
white
head
sticky
enough
to
leave
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
bready
but
also
notes
of
vegetation
and
citrus
taste
is
full
making
the
experience
of
drinking
a
relatively
light
beer
like
this
enjoyable
as
opposed
to
a
necessary
step
toward
toward
drunkenness
cough
mouthfeel
is
light
smooth
and
certainly
sessionable
enjoyed
easy
drinking
the
beer
is
decent
but
leaves
room
for
improvement
o
nice
drinker
that
goes
down
easy
especially
on
a
hot
afternoon
pretty
true
to
the
style
blue
paddle
pilsener
was
poured
in
to
a
standard
pint
glass
it
was
a
true
to
style
yellow
color
with
a
pure
white
head
the
head
was
about
one
finger
but
turned
to
wisps
fast
it
did
lace
for
the
glass
the
head
fading
may
have
been
some
residue
of
soap
in
the
glass
the
smell
had
the
distinct
pilsen
yeast
with
a
light
floral
hop
the
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
and
ha
a
great
pilsener
taste
the
hops
were
a
good
balan
e
but
did
not
dominate
very
good
with
hints
of
the
crystal
malt
for
complexity
a
clean
aftertaste
finishes
this
great
specimen
off
right
worth
hunting
for
cheers
ontap
at
the
brewery
in
lovely
fort
collins
co
clean
gold
with
a
healthy
head
of
white
foam
mild
grainy
malt
and
spicy
hop
on
the
nose
the
palate
gives
more
complexity
with
clean
sweet
malt
underneath
a
soft
hop
bitterness
and
black
pepper
and
fresh
flower
flavor
well
crafted
and
refreshing
but
a
bit
more
in
the
way
of
hops
would
be
welcome
but
im
sure
they
were
going
for
a
crowdpleaser
with
this
one
a
sub
5
0
beer
is
always
welcome
on
a
warm
spring
afternoon
good
for
the
style
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
would
drink
another
if
it
was
offered
o
on
par
for
the
style
but
nothing
spectacular
o
i
recalled
not
liking
this
beer
for
years
finally
giving
it
a
second
try
i
can
say
that
it
is
definitely
better
than
i
remember
but
still
not
something
amazing
the
bitterness
seems
out
of
joint
with
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
and
the
lingering
bitterness
and
bite
dont
help
i
guess
its
just
not
a
beer
for
me
overall
a
slightly
above
average
pilsener
and
a
really
good
effort
from
new
belgium
o
not
a
world
beater
in
fact
its
pretty
middle
of
the
road
like
most
things
new
belgium
but
this
is
something
little
170
lb
me
could
kill
a
six
pack
of
on
a
hot
summer
day
without
feeling
like
im
drinking
a
water
facsimile
in
that
regard
it
earns
high
marks
in
drinkabilityoverall
score
overall
a
summer
drinking
beer
like
it
was
intended
crisp
and
refreshing
and
delightfully
middle
of
the
road
i
feel
lucky
to
have
something
from
new
belgium
whenever
i
have
the
opportunity
and
i
am
beginning
to
see
some
common
threads
delicate
balanced
and
drinkable
there
is
nothing
particularly
remarkable
about
blue
paddle
but
theres
nothing
bad
either
overall
this
is
one
of
my
first
quality
pilsners
and
i
am
rather
impressed
this
has
a
much
stronger
taste
and
is
better
than
i
imagined
an
alright
pils
but
there
are
better
ones
for
this
style
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
color
under
a
lumpy
pure
white
head
of
fluffy
foam
webby
lacing
appears
pretty
well
carbonated
weak
clean
dusty
grain
aroma
pretty
much
nothing
from
the
hops
department
grassy
lightly
spiced
flavor
over
crispy
cracker
grain
with
a
slight
fine
sweetness
quite
crisp
and
dry
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
though
it
could
just
be
in
contrast
to
the
overall
mildness
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
light
bodied
with
a
bitter
finish
far
from
awful
just
sort
of
lacking
overall
a
very
refreshing
brew
it
actually
feels
a
bit
heavier
than
4
8
for
some
reason
but
this
is
easily
sessionable
not
up
to
european
standards
but
a
perfectly
serviceable
new
world
attempt
nice
drinkable
abv
clean
and
refreshing
do
this
americanbrewed

lager
seems
a
bit
restrained
by
comparison
to
the
toptier
of
craftbrewed
domestic
pilsners
such
as
victory
prima
pils
but
matches
up
fairly
well
with
respectable
european
brands
malt
stands
out
more
than
hops
without
really
being
maltfocused
although
hop
bitterness
is
present
almost
throughout
the
taste
it
definitely
doesnt
measure
up
as
an
ipl
flavored
with
noble
hops
but
it
does
hit
the
traditional
pilsner
dartboardif
not
the
bullseye
f
bitter
exhaust
like
dry
pine
needles
in
a
good
way
d
probably
would
not
be
a
good
goto
pils
drinkability
is
low
for
a
pils
which
is
a
huge
flaw
very
doughy
loses
drinkability
even
more
as

would
i
drink
this

whos
to
say
really
dont
seek
out
if
it
wasnt
for
that
weird
metallic
off

in
the
finish

would
have
called
this
a
better

because
of
it
it
only
comes
across
as
average
reviewed

its
a
good
session
beer
but
i
thought
it
might
have
benefited
from
a
more
complex
flavor
theres
a
good
amount
of
bitter
but
not
enough
of
anything
else
bright
yellow
with
a
tall
white
head
and
nice
carbonation
smells
like
cereal
grass
and
a
hint
of
lemon
the
taste
is
a
straightforward
pilsnermaltassertive
but
with
pleasantly
floral
noble
hops
and
some
nice
estery
flavors
light
body
dry
finish
just
enough
hoppy
tingle
to
keep
it
interesting
the
whole
way
through
i
would
like
more
spice
or
rawness
on
the
palate
somewhere
but
you
know
its
a
good
beer
easy
to
like
and
easy
to
share
overall
impression
not
too
bad
but
i
prefer
it
while
colder
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
lacks
the
hop
complexity
to
be
truly
great
but
its
still
tasty
and
refreshing
pretty
standard
for
a
pilsner
but
good
just
the
same
tasty
and
refreshing
and
would
make
a
great
session
brew
new
belgium
blue

pilsner
moving
out
of
a
long
and
fun
time

its

to

the
new
belgium
blue
paddle
pours
into
a
glass
with
a
bright
clear
golden
body
and
nice
amount
of

carbonation
the

tall
is
pure

very
fine

wise
the

smell
like

no

here
flavor
is
subtle
all
the
way
through
faint
malt
sweetness
up

and
finishing
with
light

and
no
bitterness
very
smooth
to
drink
the
blue
paddle
is
a
great
change
of
pace
from
big
statement
craft
brews
enjoy
the
beer
was
clean
crisp
refreshing
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
had
just
enough
complexity
to
separate
it
from
the
sea
of
average

that
are
out
there
what
else
can
you
ask
for
from
a

enjoyable
overall
drinkability
pretty
decent
american

a

letter
grade
higher
overall
this
was
a
fairly
unexciting
pilsener
expected
more
from
new
belgium
i
wont
seek
this
out
again
the
flavors
are
very
clean
and
earthy
some
grassy
notes
and
a
bit
of
lemon
on
the
finish
very
very
fast
finish
clean
the
flavor
comes
in
and
gets
out
fast
o
though
rather
simple
the
flavors
were
pleasant
and
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
o
better
then
most
pilsners
but
i
have
yet
to
find
a
stand
out
pilsner
as
of
yet
very
fine
pilsner
a
definite
repeat
purchase
o
a
solid
new
belgium
offering
that
i
like
but
wont
be
likely
to
confuse
with
stoudts
pils
or
victory
prima
pils
as
the
frontrunners
of
the
american
take
on
the
style
do
ive
had
better
of
the
style
though
ive
certainly
had
worse
this
is
a
good
candidate
for
some
with
decent
flavor
that
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
solid
pilsener
nice
and
crisp
slightly
citrusy
and
likely
amazing
outside
on
a
patio
pours
out
clear
like
any
other
pilsner
clear
with
a
golden
hue
the
aroma
of
the
noble
hops
emerges
out
as
the
most
pungent
aroma
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
the
clears
there
is
only
a
light
and
slight
bitternes
to
this
beer
very
good
american
interpurtation
of
a
czech
pilsner
where
most
american
craft
beers
are
going
for
fruitful
beers
o
no
real
big
flavors
but
certainly
a
goodlight
summer
beer
so
if
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
then
pick
one
up
o
decent
and
worthy
of
a
pint
when
youre
not
feeling
anything
over
5
worth
the
tick
reviewing
this
beer
on
a
warm
summer
day
in
early
june
first
note
picked
up
is
strong
smell
of
noble
hops
with
slight
malt
taste
in
the
backround
head
is
light
and
not
much
carbonation
small
amount
of
lacing
in
regular
pint
glass
very
similar
to
euro
style
or
czech
style
pilsner
lagers
mouthfeel
is
light
but
with
good
flavor
overall
a
good
summer
brew
best
enjoyed
on
very
hot
days
90
not
something
to
go
searching
for
but
i
would
buy
again
o
not
bad
but
not
that
far
above
average
no
offflavors
but
really
miss
the
hops
still
a
good
thirst
quencher
that
would
do
well
on
a
warm
day
worth
a
try
it
was
a
while
ago
since
i
had
this
beer
so
i
cant
really
get
specific
on
it
but
it
is
certainly
a
traditional
pilsner
and
im
generally
not
crazy
about
pilsners
but
this
one
has
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
and
wet
in
the
mouth
the
beer
was
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
thick
soapy
white
head
that
left
a
lot
of
lacing
smells
of
lemon
with
light
pilsner
malt
grass
and
hay
there
is
a
smooth
but
solid
bitterness
the
taste
consists
of
lemon
peel
with
a
light
pine
flavor
and
a
biscuity
background
the
beer
is
light
with
prickly
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
i
would
choose
this
pilsner
over
any
other
that
i
have
tried
so
far
has
a
crisp
clean
feel
to
it
and
leaves
the
palate
satisfied
overall
this
is
a
thirst
quencher
of
a
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
with
fish
and
fresh
vegetables
and
it
was
the
perfect
light
and
crisp
combo
with
a
light
meal
as
summer
nears
this
one
will
be
a
staple
for
the
fridge
well
crafted
style
that
is
easy
to
overlook
crisp
refreshing
and
only
gets
better
on
tap
overall
not
a
bad
pilsner
at
all
nothing
really
earth
shattering
here
but
still
a
very
solid
effort
i
would
most
certainly
not
turn
this
one
down
if
offered
it
again
especially
with
the
warm
weather
approaching
drinkability
enjoyed
three
of
these
after
work
and
was
able
to
get
a
positive
vibe
from
this
beer
new
belgium
always
does
a
great
job
though
dtoo
bad
i
only
had
one
this
is
another
solid
american
pilsener
and
one
i
will
stock
up
when
warmer
weather
rolls
around
very
well
crafted
and
highly
drinkable
overall
an
excellent
pils
that
i
highly
recommend
hadnt
had
this
one
in
years
but
glad
i
did
avail
here
in
tx
rotation
this
would
make
a
good
addition
to
my
light
wit
wheats
etc
rotation
especially
in
the
summer
ry
a
perfect
example
of
a
lager
done
right
this
one
hits
the
spot
d
im
not
a
pilsner
fan
but
i
want
another
one
of
these
its
like
they
have
upped
the
game
a
little
aroma
is
light
malty
grain
that
gets
progressively
bready
as
i
warms
mild
herbal
hop
taste
is
light
malt
with
some
caramel
sweetness
in
back
that
herbal
hop
spices
from
the
aroma
is
back
again
and
its
brought
an
unfortunate
friend
antiseptic
aftertaste
the
hop
bill
is
saaz
liberty
and
target
which
is
odd
because
i
love
saaz
and
liberty
not
too
familiar
with
target
hops
leave
a
swampy
antiseptic
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
kinda
fizzy
d
this
beer
was
pretty
clean
with
a
few
off
flavors
this
is
definitely
drinkable
and
solid
the
lack
of
malt
as
fast
as
i
could
tell
is
a
drawback
i
wouldnt
put
it
among
the
top
pilsners
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
turn
one
down
d
very
easy
drinker
but
a
stronger
grain
flavor
without
the
metallic
hint
would
move
drinkability
to
4
5
or
5
0
light
golden
straw
no
head
continuous
bubbles
from
etching
in
glass
superb
clarity
smells
a
touch
skunky
over
the
base
of
straw
scented
malts
bitter
pilsner
flavor
taste
is
a
bit
too
bitter
for
a
good
pilsner
style
more
like
a
kolsch
d
high
marks
for
drinkability
more
bitterness
and
carbonation
might
make
me
want
more
but
a
beer
worthy
of
a
six
pack
carrier
the
alcohol
body
and
bitterness
of
this
beer
bring
it
firmly
into
the
german
family
of
pilseners
rather
than
the
bohemian
well
done
and
refreshing
another
solid
beer
from
new
belgium
blue
paddle
pilsener
lager
was
bright
gold
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
light
malt
and
noble
hops
the
taste
was
a
nice
blend
of
noble
hops
over
a
light
malt
base
with
some
bitterness
coming
through
the
finish
was
dry
and
a
touch
bitter
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
this
is
a
tasty
pilsner
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
well
worth
a
try
kinda
surprised
by
the
low
marks
on
this
pilsner
given
the
styles
on
the
mark
for
a
german
pilsner
i
could
drink
this
all
afternoon
too
bad
i
only
picked
up
one
i
prefer
my
paddles
to
be
yellow
or
without
color
this
clearly
inferior
blue
model
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
wheat
grass
and
flowers
quite
mild
the
taste
adds
more
flowers
a
touch
of
orange
peel
and
a
few
drops
of
mandarin
orange
juice
near
the
finish
line
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
pils
one
of
the
better
american
versions
ive
come
across
in
a
while
carbonated
well
to
give
it
a
crisp
finish
and
despite
not
being
outstanding
very
drinkable
overall
a
soild
german
pilsner
not
exceptional
but
nothing
really
to
criticise
either
d
very
easy
refreshing
and
light
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
drinkability
with
lower
abv
and
the
dryish
finish
its
easy
to
drink
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
visible
carbonation
and
a
white
head
the
nose
is
some
floral
and
herbal
hops
with
grain
in
the
back
the
taste
is
straw
and
grain
with
some
light
noble
hopping
fairly
light
mouthfeel
with
high
levels
of
carbonation
drinks
well
especially
in
the
summer
although
there
are
certainly
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
you
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
without
getting
worn
out
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
poured
into
a
12
oz
beer
glass
the
color
was
a
light
amber
the
head
came
on
nicely
at
about
1
not
a
real
creamy
head
but
left
nice
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
as
i
drank
the
brew
smell
was
a
light
hoppy
pleasant
smell
and
the
taste
was
very
good
with
just
a
slight
hoppy
finish
taste
had
a
good
balance
mouthfeel
was
good
not
thin
and
watery
like
most
lagers
drinkability
was
wonderful
mos
definately
will
buy
this
brew
again
new
belgium
beers
have
a
great
reputation
and
this
beer
ived
up
to
its
name
it
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
not
to
much
of
a
scent
that
stands
out
it
has
a
very
light
carbonation
which
makes
for
some
very
easy
drinking
it
goes
down
well
and
finishes
with
a
great
taste
only
thing
people
might
not
like
about
this
beer
is
its
lighter
flavor
in
comparison
to
many
craft
brews
mouth
is
smooth
light
and
crisp
and
with
that
quite
drinkable
really
if
your
looking
for
something
sessionable
this
one
surprised
me
it
was
better
than
i
expected
everything
was
mild
but
everything
blended
together
very
well
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
balance
of
spicy
noble
hops
and
biscuity
malt
it
has
nice
strength
for
the
style
and
is
pleasing
the
taste
leans
toward
the
maltier
side
with
little
hops
coming
through
it
is
a
rather
light
it
flavor
for
a
pilsener
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
aggressive
carbonation
and
an
almost
but
not
quite
watery
texture
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
that
i
will
probably
not
drink
again
12
oz

a
filtered
yellowgold
with

a
tight
white
head
that
deposits
clinging
lace
in
the
nose
theres
a
sweet

earthy

it
has
a
complex
sweetish
toasynutty

flavor
munich
malt
decoction
and
is
filled
with
noble
hops
that
impart
a
medium

with
its

each
sip
begs
for
another
delicious
and
refreshing
i
love
a
wellmade
lager
a
very
pleasant
surprise
in
a
12
pack
sample
with
ranger
fat
tire
and
hoptober
all
of
which
ive
had
and
enjoy
this
has
classic
pilsner
profile
but
more
yeast
in
the
aroma
and
taste
again
a
nice
surprise
since
i
viewed
this
as
the
lightest
offering
in
the
pack
new
belgium
has
never
knocked
my
socks
off
but
really
makes
some
pretty
good
stuff
d
very
refreshing
a
great
lawnmower
beer
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
but
the
clean
simplicity
wins
you
over
in
the
end
drinkability
not
the
most
full
flavored
pilsner
around
but
quite
elegant
and
drinkable
more
than
solid
pilsner
overall
i
could
have
easily
chugged
several
glasses
but
it
didnt
quite
hit
the
spot
pours
a
clear
light
gold
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
slowly
dissipated
leaving
some
lacing
smells
crisp
a
little
grassy
hop
not
a
very
strong
smell
taste
is
also
of
grassy
hop
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
hop
and
some
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
decent
carbonation
overall
pretty
good
pilsner
but
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had
if
it
was
offered
to
me
i
would
surely
have
it
again
d
wow
what
a
refreshing
brew
i
wouldnt
mind
tossing
back
a
few
of
these
babies
on
a
hot
day
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
i
really
liked
the
appearance
of
the
beer
as
well
definitely
worth
picking
up
and
id
probably
buy
it
again
sometime
cheers
d
above
average
beer
its
pretty
drinkable
and
offers
up
some
solid
flavors
give
it
a
try
being
light
bodied
and
somewhat
lowish
in
alcohol
this
is
almost
a
session
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
too
much
of
this
when
the
weather
turns
cooler
but
its
a
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
when
its
warm
1130
am
on
a

fort

went
up
to
fort

with
the

and

for
a
few
beers
some
junkin
and
some
lunchdinner
my
wife
used
one
of
her
complimentary
tokens
on

didnt
really
like
it
and
gave
it
to
me
golden
color
rockyclingy
white

aromas
of

lemon
and
malt
with
a
flavor
to
match
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
not
much
more
would
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
over
their
others
no
but
it
fills
its
role
nicely
d
its
ok
i
wouldnt
go
outta
my
way
for
it
decent
but
i
like
the
victory

better
also
the
sam

is
better
best
before

id
say
this
is
a
fine
german
pils
with
a
bit
of
belgian
influence
the
grains
are
a
touch
smoother
and
less
crisp
than
usual
theres
also
an
american
twist
with
a
little
more
hops
character
than
usual
though
its
not
so
high
to
be
out
of
the
realm
of
german
brewing
the
barley
character
like
a
lot
of
the
nbb
beers
has
a
slight
cookie
or
biscuit
taste
that
goes
over
dry
toasty
grains
and
is
followed
by
herbal
citrus
hops
all
in
all
a
tasty
pilsner
thats
a
touch
different
and
interesting
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
malt
and
a
nice
dry
pilsner
hop
in
the
taste
sweet
to
dry
malt
and
saaz
hops
a
small
bite
but
mainly
smooth
and
light
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
to
dry
malt
in
the
aftertaste
a
clean
and
fresh
pils
very
nice
this
is
very
drinkable
as
it
is
light
but
has
good
flavor
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
worth
trying
i
think
new
belgium
really
nailed
this
one
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
brewery
i
think
theres
a
lot
of
hype
around
it
and
thier
beers
that
are
just
pretty
much
okay
in
this
case
they
really
put
out
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
this
is
a
good
picnic
boating
or
lounging
around
summertime
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
very
light
straw
color
with
a
2
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
quite
well
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
nice
backbone
of
noble
hops
and
some
slight
earthiness
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
with
some
grain
up
front
with
dry
bitter
hops
finishing
things
off
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
much
and
takes
away
from
the
sweetness
upfront
this
is
a
thin
body
brew
with
little
carbonation
all
and
all
and
average
brew
this
is
a
very
nice
version
of
a
german
pils
new
belgium
continues
to
please
a
good
beer
to
have
around
for
those
who
appreciate
more
than
bmc
or
when
in
need
of
a
thirst
quencher
or
palate
cleanser
very
easy
drinker
that
is
easy
to
pair
with
a
ham
and
cheese
bbq
chicken
or
a
burger
mouthfeel
is
light
almost
feathery
so
much
so
that
it
almost
feels
like
it
evaporates
off
the
palate
nice
crisp
carbonation
as
well
stupidly
drinkable

am
ample

lovely

a
little
toasted

very
smooth

with
a
tasty
noble

flavor
and
lighttomoderate
bitternesss
in
the
finish
decent
amount
of
body
and
heft
for
a
pilsner
definitely
more
czech
than
german
despite
the
ample
maltiness
bitter
hops
linger
on
the
tongue
after
several
sips
an
excellent
example
of
a
czech
pilsner
i
think
ill
be
revisiting
this
often
through
the
warm
months
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard

and
crisp
with
a
lightmedium
body
and
some
dryness
overall
the
beer
is
good
and
a
fine
example
of
a
german
pilsner
d
so
easy
like
throwing
back
bud
light
i
could
easily
down
58
of
these
drinkability
is
superb
d
too
hops
forward
not
my
type
of
pilsner
but
its
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
wouldnt
complain
if
this
was
all
there
was
to
drink
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
blue
paddle
is
a
perfectly
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
dense
foamy
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
nice
lacing
a
small
population
of
bubbles
slowly
rise
from
the
depths
of
the
glass
the
nose
isnt
terribly
distinct
bits
of
lightly
toasted
malts
mixed
with
grassy
herbal
maybe
citrusy
hops
the
taste
to
me
is
slightly
better
with
the
lightly
toasted
malt
taking
center
stage
with
a
more
defined
presence
slightly
bready
the
hops
too
seem
more
obvious
with
the
grassy
citrusy
notes
being
dominate
very
citric
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
minimal
carbonation
that
still
seems
a
little
creamy
which
makes
for
easy
drinking
im
not
much
of
a
pilsner
man
but
if
i
was
i
think
this
would
be
a
decent
one
to
reach
for
fiance
says
its
meh
drinkable
but
she
would
not
buy
this
again
ive
had
this
brew
on
several
past
ocassions
and
from
what
i
remembered
it
was
better
then
than
it
was
today
pleasant
but
nothing
to
rave
about
still
this
is
really
good
d
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
that
was
quite
enjoyable
not
the
most
complex
beer
on
the
planet
but
easy
to
drink
and
good
for
a
session
with
friends
i
just
found
blue
paddle
the
other
night
and
didnt
know
much
about
it
it
really
is
a
decent
lighter
beer
it
looks
very
similar
to
other
light
beers
golden
in
color
the
difference
is
the
flavor
blue
paddle
has
a
lot
of
flavor
for
being
a
lighter
beer
its
a
good
beer
if
you
get
the
chance
to
have
it
i
liked
the
brew
it
went
well
with
the
chili
although
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
noble
hop
presence
here
a
solid
pilsner
more
malt
forward
than
say
prima
pils
nothing
great
but
just
a
solid
pilsner
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
very
crisp
very
smooth
after
a
days
hardwork
in
the
kitchen
or
workin
on
the
power
lines
you
could
for
sure
cool
down
with
a
sixer
of
these
unfortunately
we
got
them
in
december
but
ill
remember
in
july
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
and
lacing
the
smell
was
a
sweet
malt
smell
with
a
floral
hop
background
the
taste
was
german
malt
forward
wit
a
crisp
pils
hop
and
floral
bouquet
imo
the
malts
took
over
on
this
one
and
the
hops
did
not
come
thru
i
will
choose
hoptober
over
blue
paddle
did
not
like
this
one
as
much
as
hoptober
due
to
the
malt
override
worth
a
try
you
be
the
judge
d
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
pils
i
would
like
a
bit
more
flavor
but
would
easily
have
several
notes
this
beer
is
rather
unexciting
but
thats
a
moot
point
because
excitement
is
not
what
a
pilsener
aims
for
in
terms
of
style
this
beer
definitely
succeeds
in
the
hop
bitterness
refreshment
flavor
and
drinkability
categories
it
seems
to
me
this
beer
would
make
a
great
introduction
to
craft
beer
to
a
macro
drinker
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
produces
a
small
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
appearance
is
yellow
with
a
little
amber
and
clear
the
aroma
is
of
light
hops
and
malt
the
taste
is
good
with
malty
sweetness
and
slight
bitterness
the
feels
is
about
average
for
a
lager
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
no
sharp
edges
a
refreshing
pils
12
oz

a

had

not

nice

very

almost
no

havent
tried
imported

not
sure
how
this
stacks
up
thought
it
was
decent
drinkability
is
good
priced
right
and
low
abv
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
having
another
glass
of
fat
tire
would
probably
order
this
one
again
drinks
decent
but
personally
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
taste
is
earthy
and
floral
with
a
pretty
good
balance
between
graininess
and
a
clean
bitter
finish
it
does
not
have
a
very
bright
feel
to
it
as
the
almost
soiltasting
malts
make
it
seem
a
bit
dull
still
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
lager
and
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
d
easily
drinkable
flavors
arent
so
overbearing
that
it
makes
it
difficult
to
session
abv
is
well
in
line
not
very
filling
nice
for
a
lager
style
conclusion
nice
american
example
of
the
germanstyle
pilsener
crisp
and
thirstquenching
and
this
doesnt
have
the
skunktinny
flavors
of
many
of
the
imports
at
9
00
this
was
a
bit
expensive
where
we
got
it
but
for
the
typical
price
around
7
50
its
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
at
all
this
went
great
with
sauteed
zuchinni
and
jalapeno
quesadillas
with
black
bean
and
corn
salsa
d
this
is
a
nice
american
interpretation
of
the
classic
german
style
one
might
argue
its
more
like
the
czech
version
regardless
nice
beer
but
perhaps
a
little
on
the
malty
side
and
while
appropriate
to
style
the
sulfur
component
is
a
little
more
than
i
care
for
pours
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
medium
head
the
nose
is
very
grainy
taste
is
citrus
and
hops
easy
to
drink
but
i
felt
i
must
keep
this
one
pretty
cool
or
it
didnt
hold
up
this
is
an
issue
with
me
since
most
beer
i
drink
holds
up
warm
or
cold
cold
and
the
taste
was
good
as
it
warmed
not
so
good
nice
medium
body
carbonation
sting
in
the
finish
a
goodsized
ivory
head
over
a
clear
light
golden
body
aromas
of
grainy
malts
with
a
bit
of
earthy
hoppiness
to
balance
out
taste
is
about
the
same
with
similar
balance
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
it
doesnt
do
too
much
to
tone
down
the
very
welcome
grassy
hops
in
this
brew
this
beer
is
clean
and
straightforward
i
am
a
fan
and
give
props
to
new
belgium
for
once
again
creating
a
good
drinking
beer
beer
poured
a
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
nose
is
malty
with
hints
of
those
german
hops
taste
is
heavy
on
sweet
malts
balanced
quite
nicely
by
those
german
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
decently
carbonated
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
nice
take
on
the
pils
style
quite
sessionable
and
a
very
refreshing
brew
for
a
warm
summer
day
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
quite
grainy
and
bready
pretty
much
your
standard
smelling
german
pilsner
maybe
a
slight
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
the
beer
is
brilliantly
clear
with
a
nice
white
fluffy
head
with
okay
head
retention
looks
like
a
great
pilsner
there
is
a
bready
flavour
in
the
background
with
a
nice
bitterness
you
can
definitely
taste
the
spicy
noble
hops
with
each
sip
the
balance
is
pretty
good
but
the
beer
isnt
as
clean
as
id
like
a
pilsner
to
be
its
just
not
crisp
enough
the
flavours
are
quite
mild
and
id
like
more
maltiness
in
the
beer
besides
that
its
a
decent
tasting
pilsner
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
good
pretty
drinkable
brew
as
well
d
where
this
beer
wins
is
in
its
drinkability
its
very
balanced
not
heavy
or
too
light
the
flavor
neither
weak
or
overwhelming
a
great
straightahead
pilz
that
beats
the
macros
d
better
than
average
much
better
than
a
miller
not
as
skunky
as
a
europils
which
is
just
fine
by
me
good
american
take
on
a
pils
i
am
not
a
huge
lager
fan
and
this
beer
proves
my
point
nothing
that
really
stands
out
about
this
one
i
loved
the
prima
pils
but
this
offering
from
new
belgium
comes
nowhere
close
its
just
your
typical
thin
watery
minimal
flavors
i
do
enjoy
some
of
there
other
beers
but
this
one
is
just
way
too
average
for
my
liking
d
a
solid
pilsener
with
excellent
allmalt
goodness
with
a
strong
noble
hops
presence
more
of
that
hoppiness
and
i
think
this
beer
would
be
even
better
d
very
smooth
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
clean
pilsner
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
mouth
feel
is
kinda
chalky
astringent
and
carbonated
the
pilsner
is
decent
the
hops
is
coarse
through
out
this
beer
but
not
harsh
it
is
really
close
to
the
classic
american
except
is
lacks
a
few
qualities
i
would
have
like
to
seen
some
creaminess
in
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
second
i
felt
that
the
beer
is
not
well
put
together
i
feel
that
the
beer
ingredients
are
not
being
presented
on
the
palate
as
one
d
this
beer
did
many
things
to
remind
me
of
some
of
the
great
german
pilseners
which
is
good
and
more
than
i
can
say
for
most
pilsener
american
or
otherwise
i
just
didnt
quite
feel
it
pulled
it
off
the
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
were
the
two
main
issues
i
had
this
being
said
solid
value
and
best
american
pils
ive
had
lately
not
brewed
in
the
bohemian
tradition
consumed
010508
poured
clear

into
stella

sorry
it
was
either
that
or
a
shaker
i
do
not
have
a
pilsener
glass
or
flute
moderate
whitish
head
diminishing
to
very
slight

nice
pilsener
aroma
grassy
with
crisp

notes
mild
to
moderate

crisp
finish
and
a
flavorful
pilsener
within
category
i
find
it
a
good
offering
and
domestic
to
boot
i
enjoy
the
new
belgian
beers
cheers
overall
its
too
bland
of
a
beer
for
me
drinkability
a
nice
guzzler
but
cant
compete
with
the
true
thing
across
the
pond
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
seek
out
again
as
lager
option
i
surely
would
like
to
have
this
in
a
restaurant
but
not
quite
the
caliber
of
a
pikeland
or
a
prima
this
is
a
nice
beer
after
my
little
run
today
it
is
a
nice
looking
pilsner
with
a
perfectly
clear
golden
body
and
a
thin
flimsy
white
head
has
a
mouthfeel
like
seltzer
water
the
smell
has
a
nice
aroma
of
hops
but
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
ordinary
it
has
a
good
taste
crisp
clean
refreshing
it
tastes
a
little
straw
like
with
a
nice
balance
of
esters
the
only
problem
is
it
lacks
that
real
characteristic
pilsner
flavor
i
like
otherwise
it
is
a
great
beer
pours
a
bright
clear
golden
color
sturdy
soapy
white
head
hangs
in
for
a
long
time
and
leaves

clingy

the

smell
slight
lemon
flavor
grassy

nice
lingering

on
this
one
good
stuff
godd
drinkability
out
of
mixed
six
pack
this
bottle
of
brew
poured
into
my
glass
a
bright
clear
gold
color
that
displayed
great
clarity
and
some
good
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
white
laced
fairly
well
and
retained
itself
as
a
thin
collar
the
aroma
was
a
nice
balance
of
grassy
and
slightly
lemony
hops
atop
a
grainy
pilsnermalt
base
the
flavors
were
also
well
balanced
a
zing
of
hops
up
front
with
adequate
bitterness
followed
by
pale
malt
and
some
hints
of
semisweet
malt
not
complex
but
solid
the
body
was
medium
the
carbonation
lively
and
the
mouthfeel
clean
i
dont
ordinarily
like
pilsners
much
but
this
one
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
found
it
refreshing
and
crisp
as
one
should
be
overall
just
a
very
solid
very
nice
beer
i
nearly
drank
the
whole
six
pack
in
a
night
bitterness
lets
you
know
the
beers
there
but
very
approachable
very
good
offering
from
new
belgium
a
pleasant
surprise
pricequality
ratio
often
factors
into
my
drinkability
score
and
here
it
is
a
downside
to
this
beer
maybe
its
cheaper
in
colorado
but
id
rather
spring
for
a
cheaper
full
sail
sessions
as
a
goto
basic
tasty
lager
otherwise
a
quite
drinkable
pleasant
brew
d
middle
of
the
road
pils
for
those
scared
off
by
nbs
other
offerings
nothing
more
really
doesnt
have
any
glaring
faults
but
doesnt
scream
for
recognition
as
a
top
of
the
line
lager
either
serves
its
purpose
it
is
a
golden
straw
yellow
it
has
a
nice
white
head
that
is
very
frothy
there
is
good
lacing
it
smells
very
floral
malt
and
hopped
it
has
a
wonderful
taste
it
is
floral
with
a
piney
citrus
aftertaste
i
has
a
good
mouthfeel
it
is
a
little
fizzy
the
drinkability
is
great
d
if
you
like
your
pilsner
with
some
feel
and
flavor
this
is
a
good
pick
d
drinks
good
and
easy
not
my
most
favorite
pilsner
but
it
is
still
very
good
great
appearance
but
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
with
the
flavor
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
light
golden
color
with
very
thin
white
head
that
dissappears
quickly
smell
is
fruity
hops
yeast
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
from
malts
bready
theres
also
a
faint
hops
flavor
mouthfeel
is
just
averageclean
slight
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
pilseners
out
there
d
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
quickly
perfect
summer
beer
this
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
very
good
pilsener
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
a
bit
thin
not
quite
enough
carbonation
for
my
liking
for
this
style
nice
beer
not
bad
but
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
nice
yeasty
goodness
and
good
flavors
a
very
nice
german
pilsner
very
quenching
and
refreshing
this
beer
doesnt
strike
me
as
being
overly
special
but
its
something
that
i
would
consider
buying
again
the
price
might
be
a
little
steep
for
a
party
beer
since
it
is
comparable
to
other
lessexpensive
beers
that
taste
similar
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
nothing
incredibly
unique
pours
a
nice
transparent
gold
with
a
decent
finebubbled
head
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
flavor
is
mouthfilling
mostly
malty
but
with
an
appreciable
hop
component
and
a
hint
of
apple
or
pear
texture
is
sassy
and
overall
this
is
a
lipsmacking
pilsner
this
beer
is
quite
good
and
plenty
drinkable
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
nice
crisp
floral
pilsner
not
your
typical
macro
flavors
even
other
craft
brewers
like
victory
have
very
macroish
versions
of
pilsner
nb
however
stands
to
the
side
offering
a
twist
on
the
pilsner
style
clear
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
nice
collection
of
zesty
hops
and
citrus
fruits
in
the
nose
the
flavor
does
not
quite
meet
expectations
fairly
light
with
some
grainy
malts
highly
carbonated
crisp
body
a
drinkable
pilsner
but
did
not
live
up
to
my
hopes
from
the
start
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
classic
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
2
finger
head
nice
lacing
aroma
is
faint
but
i
can
pick
out
some
sweet
toasty
malt
maybe
some
saaz
too
flavor
is
mostly
cereal
grain
that
comes
out
a
little
too
heavy
for
the
style
limiting
the
crispness
now
that
i
think
about
it
its
not
only
cereal
grainy
it
actually
tastes
like
breakfast
cereal
theres
a
cheerios
note
in
there
anyway
the
hops
are
almost
nonexistent
in
the
flavor
which
also
contributes
to
the
lack
of
crispness
drinkable
but
off
the
mark
for
the
style
as
far
as
im
concerned
d
definitely
likable
a
better
than
average
pilsener
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
new
belgium
when
crafting
this
style
and
must
admit
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
one
id
probably
get
again
even
when
the
office
isnt
buying
pours
brilliant
golden
with
a
decent
pure
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
but
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
as
well
very
light
hop
aroma
with
some
earthy
crisp
notes
and
a
touch
of
lager
yeast
in
the
aroma
but
thats
about
it
taste
is
about
the
same
it
lacks
the
crispness
and
bitterness
of
a
true
german
pilsner
and
the
finish
is
especially
soft
there
are
some
spicy
hp
notes
but
its
fairly
one
dimensional
even
so
it
is
still
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
spring
afternoon
some
more
noble
hop
bite
and
crispness
would
make
it
more
so
dont
drink
and
review
bottle
poured
into
mug
light
golden
color
with
12
head
that
lingered
throughout
aroma
of
hay
and
lemons
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
with
honey
lemons
and
clover
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
moderate
bitter
finish
nice
session
beer
poor
me
another
drinkability
crisp
clean
refreshing
i
could
shower
with
this
stuff
a
very
pleasurable
and
well
made
pilsner
from
new
belgium
a
tough
style
to
do
well
but
new
belgium
has
blue
paddle
dialed
in
solid
very
nice
across
the
board
leaving
me
with
no
complaints
i
typically
dont
pick
up
the
nb
brews
that
often
because
i
just
dont
like
fat
tire
but
their
triple
dubbel
and
pils
are
the
brews
i
frequently
get
when
i
want
a
taste
of
europe
without
spending
too
much
also
blue
paddle
is
a
great
gateway
beer
for
the
macro
drinker
who
wants
to
branch
out
here
try
this
its
bud
with
flavor
the
blue
paddle
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
very
little
foam
head
and
tiny
dotted
lacing
in
the
smell
category
it
faint
smell
of
citrus
and
yeasty
aroma
the
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
is
left
its
mark
on
the
back
of
the
throat
and
tip
of
the
tongue
it
is
thin
which
is
normal
for
the
style
overall
one
of
my
favorite
pilsner
session
beers
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
not
really
remarkable

itd
be
a
good

of
mouthfeel
is
thick

frothy
when
you
first
down
it
and
as
you
keep
going
it
lingers
for
a
bit
and
leaves
a
lasting
impact
on
the
palate
overall
id
say
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
powerfully
done
this
beer
pours
with
a
lot
of
head
that
clears
quickly
the
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
and
the
taste
is
mild
there
is
a
slightly
sweet
slightly
carbonated
slightly
bitter
mix
to
the
taste
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
to
set
it
apart
either
it
is
drinkable
in
so
far
as
its
an
easy
going
beer
but
its
not
the
type
of
thing
youd
seek
out
again
nothing
really
remarkable
about
this
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
d
it
is
a
nice
pilsener
that
benefits
from
some
time
breathing
before
drinking
its
not
my
drink
of
choice
but
a
nice
brew
when
eating
spicy
food
pizzas
and
mexican
dishes
d
not
terrible
but
way
off
for
the
style
i
dont
really
care
much
for
this
its
really
not
a
bad
brew
but
something
just
seems
off
to
me
taste
follows
the
nose
in
that
the
first
sip
is
flat
out
sweet
it
was
just
tongue
shock
as
the
second
sip
not
so
much
light
and
crisp
but
sweet
and
a
bit
undercarbonated
for
my
liking
i
need
something
to
sweep
away
the
sweetness
i
could
drink
one
now
and
again
but
will
not
seek
this
out
pretty
good
domestic
pils
drinkability
very
nice
effort
from
new
belgium
while
not
as
hoppy
as
prima
pils
i
really
like
the
floral
elements
that
make
it
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
brew
but
far
from
perfect
i
might
recommend
this
to
others
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
wanting
more
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
clear
gold
color
aroma
is
spicygrassy
hops
and
a
hint
of
malt
flavor
is
crisp
and
hoppy
with
just
enough
malt
to
offset
the
bitterness
finishes
hoppy
bitter
and
dry
this
is
a
solidly
pleasing
beer
this
beer
has
a
nutty
and
hoppy
smell
to
it
when
you
pop
the
top
on
it
but
it
does
pour
a
nice
rich
light
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
holds
true
and
lasts
the
first
sip
is
a
little
nutty
tasteing
which
dies
off
as
you
drink
more
of
the
beer
its
a
good
beer
just
takes
a
little
more
time
to
drink
its
quite
competent
and
i
would
certainly
not
refuse
another
its
well
worth
a
try
d
easy
to
drink
a
good
choice
if
you
want
to
knock
back
a
few
without
resulting
to
an
american
macro
drinkability
a
decent
session
beer
but
ill
stick
to
trumer
if
i
want
a
good
domestic
pils
a
solid
effort
there
are
better
pilseners
out
there
but
there
are
also
far
worse
the
taste
and
mothfeel
almost
at
a
victory
prima
pilz
level
very
nice
and
drinkable
good
stuff
indeed
for
a
new
belgian
product
this
is
actually
not
bad
stuff
in
my
opinion
of
course
its
not
nearly
hoppy
enough
for
all
that
grain
easy
to
drink
had
this
on
tap
at
little
star
pizza
in
san
franciso
pours
an
opaque
tan
with
a
medium
head
all
around
a
basic
pilsner
made
me
think
it
is
the
lager
a
bmc
would
like
to
make
basic
but
with
a
little
more
taste
not
much
more
to
say
about
it
enjoyable
but
i
would
choose
something
else
if
offered
this
would
be
a
good
beer
if
your
trying
to
weine
your
freinds
off
of
lite
beer
this
is
a
good
sesion
beer
you
can
probably
throw
a
few
of
these
back
i
havent
decided
if
im
going
to
buy
this
again
or
not
d
despite
my
just
above
average
impression
of
this
beer
i
found
this
to
be
quite
refreshing
on
the
83
degree
day
that
i
drank
it
overall
i
found
it
to
be
onedimentional
and
rather
boring
mouthfeel
was
nicely
rough
in
texture
with
some
huskiness
dry
medium
length
finish
this
is
a
subtle
yet
solid
american
pilsner
pils
are
not
my
forte
but
nb
has
made
a
nice
one
appearance
was
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
had
nice
retention
and
left
nice
lacing
smells
were
malty
a
bit
floral
and
grassy
all
around
common
pils
aromas
tastes
were
well
balance
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
a
balanced
malty
grassy
flavor
in
the
middle
and
ending
with
a
lasting
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
dry
and
slightly
thin
a
beer
worth
drinking
no
doubt
great
for
summer
days
bbqs
etc
this
beer
poured
a
dull
yellow
with
a
fair
amount
of
white
head
aroma
was
citrusy
with
a
lightly
sweet
aroma
flavor
is
acidic
tasting
with
lots
of
citrus
notes
much
more
like
a
spotted
cow
than
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
and
slightly
sticky
cant
say
id
recommend
this
again
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
especially
from
the
u
s
the
appearance
was
a
definite
strong
point
beautiful
beer
to
look
at
i
am
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
or
any
lager
for
that
matter
but
i
could
get
used
to
this
beer
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
almost
medium
bodied
wonderful
drinkability
should
be
a
great
summertime
treat
certainly
worth
another
shot
in
the
future
d
definitely
a
session
beer
with
low
abv
and
a
clean
taste
light
mouthfeel
you
can
drink
these
all
day
definitely
an
addition
to
my
summer
beer
list
pours
a
very
light
clear
yellow
thick
foamy
white
head
settles
slowly
smells
a
bit
grassy
very
malty
smooth
mouthfeel
not
a
whole
lot
else
to
say
really
its
a
very
sessionable
lager
easy
to
drink
far
better
than
most
other
american
pilseners
i
never
thought
this
pilsener
was
too
intriquing
but
for
some
reason
i
still
like
it
it
is
light
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
i
heard
a
rumour
they
were
going
to
stop
making
this
at
new
belgium
hopefully
thats
not
true
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
forming
a
very
thin
14
inch
head
that
faded
quickly
leaving
very
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
extremely
skunky
unfortunately
that
is
all
i
can
detect
the
taste
is
a
light
balance
of
hops
and
malts
nothing
that
really
stands
out
light
mouthfeel
overall
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
far
from
enjoyable
the
smell
is
terrible
and
the
taste
is
anything
but
great
i
would
recommend
looking
elsewhere
for
a
german
style
pilsner
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
if
this
is
the
what
it
normally
tastes
like
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
d
enjoyable
this
beer
would
be
perfect
on
a
warm
summer
night
or
on
a
snowy
winter
night
like
tonight
smell
is
clean
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
taste
follows
suit
mild
and
really
easy
to
drink
gets
better
the
less
is
left
in
the
glass
second
beer
in
my
lets
visit
new
belgium
beer
tour
will
again
be
a
hotwarm
weather
brew
but
not
much
of
a
cool
weather
friend
dry
and
easy
to
drink
beer
a
good
choice
for
most
any
food
normal
pilsner
color
golden

verry
hoppy
smell
almost
like
potpurri
great
pilsner
a
bit
of
a
bite
plenty
of
hop
taste
i
liked
this
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
had
a
little
high
carbonation
for
a
new
belgium
beer
this
beer
was
really
good
and
had
an
above
average
drinkability
this
beer
pours
golden
with
a
half
finger
of
white
head
visually
the
beer
looks
highly
carbonated
as
i
can
see
bubbles
rising
the
only
thing
i
can
smell
is
yeast
the
taste
is
rather
disappointing
it
tastes
like
a
standard
pilsener
which
i
wouldnt
expect
from
new
belgium
i
only
get
light
to
moderate
hop
and
slight
yeast
flavors
it
does
differ
from
a
standard
pilsener
though
because
it
is
not
incredibly
thin
feeling
it
isnt
full
bodied
but
it
isnt
budweiser
either
the
drinkability
on
this
is
pretty
low
i
really
wasnt
that
impressed
not
overly
found
of
this
beer
from
new
belgium
in
fact
this
is
the
lowest
ive
scored
on
any
of
their
beers
the
hoppy
flavor
was
not
to
my
liking
and
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
for
me
it
was
kind
of
spicy
peppery
flavor
but
had
a
flat
hoppy
finish
i
just
didnt
like
this
ale
maybe
just
a
bad
batch
or
bottle
golden
body
topped
by
a
thick
white
head
head
shows
excellent
lacing
aroma
is
very
clean
and
crisp
noble
hops
flavor
is
also
clean
with
a
touch
of
malt
accompanied
by
decent
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
hop
flavor
almost
a
peppery
note
it
finishes
very
clean
with
no
adjunct
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
solid
pils
body
and
mouthfeel
are
great
and
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
can
see
me
enjoying
this
with
dinner
fairly
often
great
offering
from
this
brewery
d
not
my
style
of
choice
normally
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
would
try
again
taste
is
dominated
by
strong
noble
hops
hops
in
the
finish
and
linger
in
the
aftertaste
crisp
and
clean
mouth
refreshing
and
tasty
a
nice
domestic
pilsener
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
rated
as
4
25
each
i
just
gave
mouthfeel
the
4
5
to
even
it
out
this
beer
is
very
crisp
and
very
very
refreshing
it
is
easily
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
my
favorite
new
belgium
brew
so
far
but
i
still
have
a
lot
more
to
try
d
a
nice
pilsner
really
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
american
pilsners
available
session
beer
here
for
sure
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
from
the
light
hop
flavor
slightly
disapointing
as
i
expected
more
hop
character
out
of
this
the
dry
finish
with
low
hop
flavor
lowers
the
drinkability
last
swigs
light
flavor
aroma
a
true
american
pilsner
ive
never
seen
a
thick
consistent
head
on
any
other
pilsner
before
great
bubbling
and
thick
lacing
to
boot
the
best
looking
pilsner
ive
had
up
to
this
point
but
the
smell
didnt
match
the
pleasant
sight
pretty
musky
for
what
was
expected
to
be
a
well
crafted
new
belgium
brew
no
clean
or
crisp
definition
of
the
malts
or
hops
the
flavor
was
slightly
better
than
your
miller
or
bud
drinakable
yet
not
what
you
expected
from
a
brewery
very
poor
example
of
the
style
a
great
pilsner
and
an
incredible
sessioner
highly
recommended
my
favorite
part
of
this
was
the
fact
that
it
was
absolutely
free
and
i
could
drink
it
while
floating
around
a
family
friends
pool
im
enjoying
new
belgium
more
and
more
when
i
can
find
it
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
my
favorite
style
but
hits
every
mark
in
terms
of
comparable
characteristics
worth
a
try
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
and
exhibited
a
very
thin
head
mouthfeel
was
good
and
over
drinkability
is
quite
nice
of
the
new
belgium
offerings
that
ive
had
thus
far
this
is
one
of
the
better
of
the
bunch
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
drinker
but
this
one
was
quite
good
i
would
definitely
give
it
another
try
d
drinkable
not
a
bad
pilsner
would
recommend
over
the
big
3
for
sure
though
tastes
grassy
and
grainy
no
sweet
malts
here
the
hops
are
just
right
crisp
bitter
and
a
bit
spicy
flavor
in
an
american
pilsner
very
nice
pleasant
carbonation
nice
dry
finish
very
drinkable
d
good
drinkability
nice
light

another
solid

color
with
very
little
head
and
some
decent
lacing

is
very
very
subtly
floral
and
grassy
definitely
subtle
taste
is
certainly
pilsnery
with
a
good
kick
of
biscuityness
near
the
end
it
starts
off
a
bit
grassy
and
hoppy
and
the
biscuit
really
smooths
it
out
makes
it
smoother
less
agressive
and
easier
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
chewy
yet
not
too
heavy
feels
nice
on
the
palate
quite
easy
to
drink
a
great
summer
beer
not
a
shabby
session
beer
and
ultimately
pretty
good
too
bad
i
only
have
one
bottle
part
of
payment
for
catsitting
whilst
my
friend
was
in
colorado
sigh
and
thats
what
it
is
overall
a
decent
beer
nice
example
of
the
style
seems
it
would
pair
well
with
many
types
of
food
quite
drinkable
but
wont
knock
your
socks
off
beautiful
clear
golden
color
one
and
a
half
finger
head
great
pilsner
scent
and
taste
extremely
refreshing
wish
i
had
more
i
will
be
searching
for
more
lagers
like
this
throughout
the
summer
enough
hop
bitterness
to
satisfy
my
ipa
loving
nature
puts
the
american
macro
lager
to
shame
reminds
me
a
little
of
when
i
first
had
pilsner
urquell
back
in
the
early
90s
i
couldnt
believe
beer
could
be
that
good
this
is
an
excellent
switch
up
from

noble
hops
tastes
malty
and
a
touch
grainy
with
some
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
im
a
bit
put
off
by
the
typical
toastiness
i
get
from
new
belgium
beers
mouthfeel
had
a
nice
presence
with
an
active
carbonation
although
it
felt
a
bit
sticky
at
times
solid
drinkability
and
easy
to
finish
hops
was
balance
enough
by
biscuit
and
slight
malt
a
bit
of
citrus
left
a
clean
feeling
good
for
spring
and
autumn
a
pretty
standard
tasting
pils
nothing
stands
out
more
then
others
so
its
fairly
good
for
a
quick
drinking
session
when
in
the
mood
for
a
pils
overall
a
nice
interpretation
of
a
quality
pilsner
very
drinkable
light
nice
flavors
and
aroma
should
hold
up
to
a
variety
of
foods
and
situations
cheers2beers
overall
impression
a
great
example
of
a
style
so
many
people
overlook
drinkable
but
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
and
hold
up
to
a
wide
variety
of
foods
this
should
be
a
staple
in
many
coolers
i
had
this
at
the
airport
bar
in
denver
in
a
very
cold
glass
so
i
had
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
the
color
was
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
there
really
wasnt
much
to
the
smell
a
bit
of
piney
hops
and
that
was
it
it
had
a
slight
bitter
taste
without
much
malt
presence
there
was
a
metallic
taste
in
there
too
the
body
was
light
and
it
was
very
refreshing
not
quite
up
to
victorys
prima
pils
but
excellent
for
the
airport
my
son
was
right
have
this
with
pizza
or
hot
mexican
or
a
heavy
german
dinner
and
its
a
great
beer
heck
its
even
pretty
decent
on
its
own
a
commendable
example
of
the
style
ill
definitely
come
back
to
this
in
the
future
obtained
from
the
brewery
and
consumed
very
fresh
reviewed
from
notes
pours
a
three
finger
white
fluffy
clingy
head
of
fine
sticky
bubbles
crystal
clear
and
very
light
straw
in
color
with
many
streamers
racing
to
the
top
smells
potently
hops
noble
not
quite
hallertauer
but
id
guess
a
hop
derived
from
a
hallertauer
parent
a
bit
of
earthy
a
bit
of
honey
and
a
tinge
of
tin
malt
is
far
below
the
hops
and
has
a
hint
of
cardboard
otherwise
its
clean
just
a
hop
dragging
down
my
nose
tastes
clean
fresh
malt
with
a
heavy
sort
of
saazy
hop
flavor
the
hops
lighten
in
the
end
to
a
clean
somewhat
citrusy
finish
this
hop
experience
is
supported
throughout
by
a
bright
honey
flavor
a
touch
of
grassy
hop
character
stands
up
as
the
beer
goes
down
the
throat
nice
dry
finish
witha
lingering
tinlike
hop
aftertaste
the
drymixed
with
the
hops
almost
comes
across
as
a
flavor
like
a
raspberry
seed
pretty
amazing
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
md
body
and
moderateheavy
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
what
i
expected
i
have
been
trying
to
break
my
habit
of
always
going
for
the
big
beers
and
this
is
a
nice
change
pours
golden
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
leaves
beautiful
lace
and
hangs
on
til
the
end
of
the
beer
the
taste
is
light
but
not
without
flavor
nice
to
have
a
beer
with
subtle
subtlties
for
a
change
i
was
surprised
by
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
which
was
pretty
substantial
not
watery
like
expected
nice
maltiness
and
hops
are
balanced
and
make
a
refreshing
brew
flavors
are
deep
and
malty
with
a
very
dry
finish
hoppiness
keeps
it
in
check
this
is
my
first
non
macro
lager
had
sa
ages
ago
and
have
no
recollection
and
its
actually
quite
enjoyable
very
light
body
high
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
all
day
once
hot
weather
is
set
in
glad
i
chose
to
drink
this
straight
from
the
fridge
as
i
feel
it
will
suffer
once
warmed
up
nb
even
recommends
drinking
at
38
degrees
this
one
really
changes
my
mind
about
my
disposition
of
lagers
the
beer
is
a
little
colder
than
recommended
and
may
be
suffering
chill
haze
a
second
warmer
bottle
was
clearer
drinkability
highly
quaffable
very
enjoyable
brew
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
very
nice
example
the
other
being
the
far
inferior
polestar
pilsener
from
lefthandand
perhaps
for
that
reason
alone
its
worth
checking
out
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
pilsner
thanks
go
to
dertbert
for
this
sample
the
body
is
light
the
bit
is
just
a
look
to
big
and
not
as
crisp
as
it
should
be
also
the
sudsy
taste
gives
a
texture
of
chalkiness
ive
had
far
worse
but
its
noticeable
here
as
well
not
as
interesting
as
most
beers
by
this
brewer
but
passable
nonetheless
opinion
well
i
have
definitely
had
better
pilsners
this
one
is
out
of
balance
for
the
style
i
would
expect
it
to
be
a
bit
more
crisp
along
with
either
more
assertion
on
the
hops
or
the
malt
this
one
ends
rather
uneventful
if
i
were
to
drink
a
us
made
pilsner
i
would
stick
to
victorys
prima
pils
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
and
has
that
pilsner
taste
that
ive
experienced
with
the
better
european
examples
this
is
one
great
session
beer
and
i
thoroughly
recommend
it
like
i
stated
had
better
samples
just
bothers
me
that
a
beer
within
200
miles
of
home
with
great
distribution
is
not
consistent
now
this
is
a
different
pils
same
looking
pour
as
american
pilsners
but
much
more
in
the
aroma
the
crisp
noble
hops
flair
up
and
the
taste
is
also
much
hoppier
than
what
i
expected
sharp
and
tangy
this
makes
for
an
exceptional
drinker
either
just
for
one
or
many
a
much
tastier
option
vs
the
bmcs
out
there
the
beer
is
golden
smells
of
grassy
hops
tastes
like
a
pilsner
feels
like
a
pilsner
i
could
drink
it
all
day
mouthfeel
has
a
solid
body
with
a
good
creaminess
that
just
flows
down
the
back
of
the
throat
so
easily
a
well
built
pilsner
that
would
be
great
for
sessioning
on
hot
summer
days
out
by
the
beach
ranks
up
there
as
one
of
my
fave
u
s
brewed
pilsners
thanks
to
mentor
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
one
starts
sweet
and
clean
with
a
bitter
hop
twinge
at
the
front
it
actually
affects
the
lips
as
much
as
the
tongue
blue
paddle
settles
light
bodied
with
a
unqiue
combination
of
sweet
sour
and
bitter
flavors
the
overall
taste
of
this
beer
is
somethign
akin
to
a
subtle
wheat
and
cream
finish
is
fairly
clean
but
with
a
notable
aftertaste
that
dwells
on
the
tastebuds
this
is
a
perfect
brew
to
wean
people
off
of
macros
both
domestic
and
euro
its
familiar
but
so
much
better
12
ounce
bottle

thanks
mentor
overall
i
would
say
a
very
enjoyable
brew
as
a
thirst
quencher
or
when
you
just
feel
like
something
lighter
a
must
try
as
a
malt
only
alternative
to
macro
lagers
that
use
adjuncts
a
very
good
representative
of
what
is
possible
with
a
style
of
beer
that
is
commonly
looked
down
on
by
people
wishing
to
avoid
this
style
only
because
it
is
so
mainstream
overall
not
too
exciting
but
a
decent
brew
pours
a
light
pale
gold
with
one
finger
white
head
that
left
sparse
lacing
aroma
is
mildy
malty
with
floral
hops
taste
is
biscuit
malt
light
and
earthy
followed
by
progressively
drying
hop
bite
with
faint
citrus
notes
at
the
tail
short
crisp
dry
finish
tasty
and
a
nice
summer
beer
overall
a
finely
crafted
pils
i
really
dig
the
bready
earthyskunky
component
but
wish
there
was
more
in
the
hop
dept
i
suspect
this
beer
is
well
received
from
people
just
entering
the
craft
brew
movement
great
for
beginners
and
a
great
alternative
to
most
pilsners
in
local
supermkts
and
liquor
stores
nice
initial
thick
head
but
doesnt
retain
long
mild
aroma
of
malt
slight
hop
smell
quite
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
much
hop
as
would
be
expected
in
a
true
pilsner
enjoyable
but
would
score
better
with
more
hops
light
bodied
with
dry
finish
fits
well
with
the
hot
sacramento
summer
goes
down
way
to
easy
appearance
is
a
lovely
light
amber
with
a
very
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
aroma
contains
an
upfront
dose
of
fresh
mowed
lawn
flowers
and
gingery
hops
that
mellow
out
into
some
malty
grains
body
is
light
to
medium
with
little
carbonation
initially
the
flavor
fulfils
the
promise
of
the
aroma
but
adds
some
bitternness
that
ends
in
a
finish
that
is
nicely
dry
and
satisfying
very
nice
to
have
on
a
hot
day
with
food
or
as
a
session
beer
not
a
real
premium
pilsner
but
very
drinkable
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
take
on
a
german
pils
that
hits
the
right
notes
on
both
hopping
and
finish
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
isnt
up
there
with
the
great
german
pils
but
i
would
buy
this
in
the
summer
as
a
thirst
quencher
i
really
enjoyed
the
pleasant
semisweet
finish
which
helps
make
it
food
friendly
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
something
i
would
buy
regularly
overall
its
a
solid
pils
thats
definitely
welcome
during
the
summer
but
perfectly
acceptable
in
any
season
and
also
perfectly
suited
to
almost
any
occasion
bbq
wedding
reception
bowling
league
nightclub
late
afternoon
at
the
skilodge
dinner
with
mom
dad
fishing
expedition
you
get
the
idea
nicely
done
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
hue
with
a
halfinch
stark
white
head
nice
clean
aroma
of
german
yeast
light
malt
and
floral
hops
taste
is
nice
but
kind
of
subtle
very
light
malt
a
touch
of
floral
hops
some
honey
sweetness
and
some
nice
german
lager
yeast
not
exactly
a
very
complex
palate
but
decent
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
about
what
youd
expect
from
a
pilsner
would
be
a
great
session
beer
if
i
had
more
than
the
two
my
brother
brought
back
from
colorado
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
head
fades
slowly
leaving
thick
laces
it
smells
citrusy
and
hoppy
it
has
the
smell
of
a
flower
there
is
a
very
faint
malt
aroma
present
if
you
look
deeply
ot
tastes
hoppy
it
has
a
crisp
taste
to
it
it
is
just
a
little
tangy
also
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
it
leaves
a
fresh
floral
aftertaste
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
carbonated
nicely
due
to
the
low
alcohol
content
this
beer
would
probably
make
a
good
session
beer
i
am
not
really
a
pilsner
fan
but
i
thought
this
beer
was
decent
this
beer
would
be
good
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
hard
to
get
down
here
and
that
makes
it
a
bit
pricey
so
i
probably
wont
buy
it
all
that
often
but
it
is
worth
a
try
this
beer
has
enticed
me
into
trying
other
examples
of
real
pilsener
such
as
pilsurquell
and
others
it
was
quite
refreshing
after
a
barrage
of
intense
beer
flavors
through
the
winter
months
so
far
this
is
the
only
pilsener
i
have
had
that
is
worthy
of
a
review
and
i
hope
to
change
that
soon
nonetheless
i
still
prefer
an
unbalanced
hoppy
brew
i
cant
normally
get
this
at
home
in
iowa
city
but
next
time
i
am
home
home
in
omaha
i
will
most
likely
skip
this
even
though
it
has
intrigued
me
i
will
definitely
try
other
new
belgium
beers
though
since
the
brewery
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
regardless
of
whether
or
not
i
am
as
obsessed
with
fat
tire
as
i
used
to
be
before
i
got
into
hoppy
beers
blue
paddle
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
compares
favorably
with
belgian
pilsners
like
stella
pils
in
belgium
accounts
for
over
80
of
the
beer
produced
ive
read
new
belgiums
other
beers
are
more
interesting
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
continental
pilsner
with
few
flaws
drinkability
not
a
real
bad
beer
for
me
but
im
still
searching
for
a
pils
that
i
like
it
looks
like
most
people
enjoy
this
so
i
guess
i
would
give
it
a
go
just
not
for
me
finish
is
an
expected
clean
crispness
very
appetizing
drinkable
this
is
an
outstanding
pilsener
equaling
some
of
the
finest
european
pilseners
on
tap
probably
the
best
american
pilsener
ive
ever
had
and
its
only
better
on
tap
at
the
brewery
at
6
996er
this
is
an
absolute
steal
highly
recommended
straw
colored
with
a
weak
head
smells
hoppy
and
tart
and
tastes
the
same
a
little
maltiness
lurks
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
and
makes
this
a
fine
hot
day
brew
combined
with
the
hoppy
nature
of
the
beer
it
makes
for
a
beer
that
certainly
earns
the
title
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
likewise
high
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
typical
pilsner
scent
pale
malts
and
a
dry
lager
yeast
finish
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
plain
pale
malt
base
with
a
slight
bitterness
it
has
a
grainy
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
clean
and
crisp
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
pilsner
it
doesnt
throw
anything
new
at
you
but
it
drinks
well
my
palate
grew
tolerant
to
this
beginning
after
a
certain
point
and
i
did
truly
find
the
beer
pretty
tasty
after
awhile
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
unless
i
was
sure
that
sulfury
taste
wasnt
there
again
blue
paddle

an
attractive
golden
color
with
a
large
thick

lacings

all
along

this
is
quite
tasty
very
crisp

i
could

the
head

at

thinned
down
pretty
quick

not

what
an
unexpected
find
at
pipe
and
pint
here
in
greensboro
today
actually
had
it
given
to
me
it
was
part
of
the
owners
personal
stashanyways
pours
a
vibrant
yellow
with
not
much
head
wich
kept
the
rating
at
4
i
really
liked
the
vibrant
color
of
this
brew
aroma
was
like
walking
thru
a
meadow
of
flowers
kinda
sweet
and
grassy
with
a
good
toasted
malt
character
taste
was
grainy
and
lightly
sweet
with
a
nice
smacking
of
hops
that
hits
nicely
in
the
finish
one
of
the
best
american
pilsners
out
there
at
least
from
my
perspective
i
wish
i
had
more
overall
this
is
a
fairly
impressive
beer
highly
drinkable
and
is
an
excellent
option
for
a
pilsner
purchase
produced
in
the
western
us
shipped
in
the
western
us
this
beer
is
far
less
likely
to
be
skunked
than
say
pilsner
urquell
blue
paddle
pilsner
is
another
quality
product
from
new
belgium
its
difficult
to
brew
a
noble
hop
lager
that
i
really
enjoy
but
this
one
comes
close
to
getting
a
big
thumbs
up
from
me
i
have
no
problem
recommending
it
since
its
one
of
the
better
domestic
pilseners
that
ive
run
across
many
thanks
to
nvsblman
for
the
hookup
ng
thanks
to
bditty
for
the
bottle
this
pils
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
big
head
that
laced
quite
well
the
smell
was
strong
of
green
apples
taste
was
malty
and
crisp
has
a
nice
aftertaste
i
thought
an
easy
beer
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
really
stood
out
on
this
beer
for
me
it
was
good
but
not
great
all
i
can
say
about
this
is
its
very
average
i
was
surprised
because
new
belgium
produces
some
of
the
most
unique
quality
brews
you
can
buy
not
saying
this
is
not
high
quality
its
just
the
same
pilsner
formula
that
everyone
seems
to
use
i
guess
i
was
expecting
blue
paddle
to
have
a
different
twistinterpretation
of
the
standard
pilsner
ie
have
a
little
flavor
or
something
nope
this
is
a
standard
pilsner
pours
a
hazy
yellow
little
head
and
even
less
lacing
hops
dominate
the
aroma
some
maltiness
in
the
taste
and
a
crisp
mouthfeel
tasted
great
with
some
fish
chips
the
maltiness
blended
well
with
the
beer
battered
fish
overall
a
good
beer
not
overwhelmingly
great
thanks
to
beer
angel
for
the
sample
overall
3
5
out
of
5
swills
clear
light
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
streams
of
small
co2
bubbles
rise
through
the
liquid
the
initial
3
fingers
of
head
falls
back
to
a
persistent
halffinger
which
leaves
a
surprising
amount
of
lace
smell
is
slightly
biscuity
with
some
mild
floral
grassy
hop
aroma
taste
was
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
more
malt
flavor
than
expected
and
just
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
as
expected
but
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
without
being
fizzy
this
is
a
good
example
of
what
an
american
pilsener
should
taste
like
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
it
blue
paddle
pours
sodapop
bubbly
and
emits
an
aroma
quite
like
a
yeast
under
duress
during
lageringsulphury
and
a
tad
autolyzed
stylistically
it
tastes
like
a
golden
ale
micro
not
belgian
while
the
hop
profile
is
quite
an
appropriate
snaptoform
for
this
brew
its
meandering
fermentation
leaves
it
flatsomwhere
between
cologne
and
dortmund
lots
of
carbonation
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
this
beer
an
ideal
warm
weather
treat
even
if
its
cold
outside
like
it
is
today
this
is
a
very
drinkable
summer
beer
but
i
would
like
to
try
a
few
other
variety
of
pilseners
before
i
had
this
one
again
pours
a
light
gold
with
very
little
head
aroma
is
a
bit
metallic
with
a
slight
detection
of
hops
has
a
light
body
that
is
crisp
and
dry
flavor
is
a
grainy
malt
with
a
bitter
finish
from
hops
overall
not
very
good
id
take
warsteiner
over
this
one
any
day
final
thoughts
imo
just
an
average
beer
the
most
disappointing
product
i
have
had
from
new
belgium
thus
far
appearance
slightly
hazed
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
forming
leaves
behind
speckled
lacing
in
concentric
patterns
at
that
aroma
upfront
nice
biscuit
malts
with
some
saaz
peeking
through
giving
a
nice
peppery
hop
profile
very
clean
altogether
taste
incredibly
crisp
and
smooth
no
cloying
off
flavors
delivers
light
malt
sweetness
and
finishing
hop
zest
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
light
bodied
smooth
but
a
bit
spritzy
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
awesome
summer
beer
i
wish
i
had
this
one
at
my
disposal
that
would
be
key
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
some
pretty
good
lacing
though
spicy
grassy
and
flowery
aromas
bready
malt
and
spicy
hop
flavor
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
mouthfeel
not
as
carbonated
as
some
pilsners
finishes
clean
a
pretty
good
pils
a
note
on
the
bottle
suggests
this
beer
be
served
at
approximately
38ºf
a
good
suggestion
as
blue
paddle
does
not
hold
up
well
to
even
a
slight
increase
in
temperature
before
developing
a
certain
sourness
still
its
a
decent
american
take
on
the
german
pilsener
style
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
standard
pilsener
hue
under
clingy
foam
fingers
aromas
of
grass
dandelions
and
fresh
donuts
just
a
perfectly
balanced
malt
and
hop
concoction
so
ultimately
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
cases
in
the
basement
rivals
the
best
out
of
duetschland
it
has
a
nice
golden
hue
but
also
that
grassy
nose
similar
to
heineken
and
other
mainstream
imports
there
is
a
bit
of
chewiness
to
the
flavor
and
it
is
a
good
crisp
drinking
beer
but
it
is
very
nondistinctive
the
label
promotes
it
as
reflective
of
europes
finest
pilsners
ive
noted
before
that
it
reminds
me
more
of
heineken
than
of
christofel
blonde
so
i
would
be
curious
to
know
what
they
regard
as
a
fine
pilsner
poured
a
big
fluffy
white
head
atop
a
beautiful
gold
beer
with
good
head
retention
i
think
this
on
has
a
little
bit
of
carapils
malt
in
it
to
achieve
this
aroma
is
extremely
light
and
the
only
thing
i
can
detect
is
a
little
toasty
bread
taste
has
a
definite
saaz
hop
character
with
a
very
mild
malt
balance
that
gets
bolder
after
each
sip
body
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
though
it
is
a
little
light
and
tends
to
make
the
hop
flavors
subside
quickly
i
would
much
rather
have
a
trippel
for
the
same
price
or
at
least
a
pine
mountain
pils
from
deschutes
this
beer
has
a
nice
gold
color
to
it
and
is
very
clear
it
is
well
carbonated
and
pours
with
a
nice
thick
white
cream
head
the
aroma
is
herbal
and
slightly
grassy
in
a
hoppy
sort
of
way
from
the
first
taste
it
is
hops
there
is
a
nice
clean
bitterness
to
it
with
subdued
hop
flavor
it
is
nice
dry
and
refreshing
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
as
well
golden
orange
color
medium
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
grassy
herbal
and
hoppy
a
medium
bodied
pilsner
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
hoppy
the
malts
are
sweet
and
fruity
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
crisp
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
some
bitterness
this
reminds
me
of
a
bohemian
pilsner
softer
less
crisp
and
less
clean
tasting
than
its
german
counterpart
the
beer
poured
out
a
pale
and
somewhat
cloudy
pale
yellow
sticky
white
head
that
clung
to
the
glass
like
meringue
subtle
lemon
grass
and
sweet
grains
in
the
aroma
hop
bitterness
is
a
bit
weak
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
muddled
but
not
a
bad
american
version
of
the
style
drinkable
in
its
own
right
flavor
it
had
a
very
dry
flat
flavor
ok
i
didnt
like
it
that
much
i
guess
im
not
a
big
pilsener
fan
id
advise
sticking
w
their
belgian
styles
update

i
reviewed
this
a
month
after
joining
the
site
back
in
the
fall
of
2003
so
thought
it
would
be
run
to
rerate
it
with
a
2004
vintage
i
juggled
a
few
scores
around
but
still
ended
up
with
a
solid
4
0
good
job
new
belgium
this
is
a
hard
style
to
nail
this
would
be
a
nice
transitional
beer
for
someone
who
likes
your
standard
american
swill
as
they
enter
micro
territory
and
this
would
be
a
good
time
to
turn
on
the
grill
and
get
some
garden
fresh
veggies
on
it
pours
a
sparkling
yellow
with
a
mountainous
white
fluffy
head
hops
are
there
and
i
can
smell
light
malt
taste
starts
out
with
a
hint
of
malt
but
this
is
quickly
flung
aside
by
a
wave
of
tart
sprucey
spicy
bitter
hops
i
like
although
it
could
be
a
little
more
balanced
mouthfeel
is
adequate
not
too
thin
plenty
of
carbonation
im
starting
to
get
into
pilsners
finally
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
too
much
not
bad
but
not
something
that
i
will
seek
out
again
overall
impression
a
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
refreshing
no
overpowering
flavors
one
of
the
more
authentic
american
pils
ive
run
across
and
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
too
pours
a
very
pale
straw
yellow
in
color
it
has
a
small
fizzy
head
that
goes
away
quite
quickly
fair
amount
of
hops
to
the
nose
similar
amount
of
hoppiness
to
the
taste
which
overpowers
a
slight
sweetness
a
mediocre
pilsner
but
still
not
too
bad
im
still
amazed
that
this
brewery
can
put
out
some
really
good
beers
followed
by
some
very
nondescript
ones
if
you
want
a
good
pilsner
try
victory
prima
pils
to
see
what
one
should
really
taste
like
thanks
to
bditty187
this
is
pilsner
beer
if
i
close
my
eyes
i
can
here
the
church
bells
ringing
in
prague
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
stands
tallbright
golden
with
virgin
whitepuffy
top
classic
grassyfloral
hop
nose
that
begets
a
sturdy
malt
accented
flavor
with
a
floralgrassy
hop
flavor
very
crips
and
clean
with
no
caffeine
this
is
the
beer
you
want
after
a
long
bike
ride
or
an
afternoon
of
gardening
a
fresh
example
of
a
traditional
european
brew
the
malt
touch
is
perfect
just
enough
structure
to
keep
it
interesting
while
still
light
enough
to
quench
your
thirst
drink
and
feel
the
history
of
lager
yeast
brewing
a
pretty
drinkable
but
forgettable
brew
ok
i
suppose
nice
pilsner
if
i
cant
get
a
czechvar
or
pilsner
urquell
you
could
gimme
one
of
these
and
i
wouldnt
feel
slighted
golden
color
great
carbonation
nice
aroma
anyone
in
the
mood
for
sausage
mustard
acquired
via
trade
i
have
never
really
been
a
fan
of
the
style
and
this
one
didnt
really
change
my
mind
on
the
matter
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
medium
thin
offwhite
head
and
rather
lively
carbonation
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
is
actually
rather
pleasant
delivering
a
nice
crisp
hops
citrus
and
malt
experience
to
the
nose
unfortunately
the
flavor
did
not
match
up
to
the
aroma
i
found
this
to
be
a
little
harsh
flavorwise
and
not
as
clean
as
i
was
hoping
hops
flavor
was
nice
but
there
was
something
off
in
the
mix
dry
finish
okay
but
new
belgium
has
better
to
offer
golden
hazy
brew
with
a
very
sticky
head
that
mostly
settles
very
sharp
hoppiness
in
the
aroma
the
signature
of
a
good
europilsner
subtle
maltiness
is
also
present
good
sharp
and
spicy
hop
bite
in
the
flavor
as
well
with
a
very
supportive
malt
backbone
of
graininess
good
body
for
a
pilsner
still
light
but
flavorful
smooth
yet
still
hoppy
finish
a
very
good
pilsner
but
since
this
isnt
a
favorite
style
mine
its
just
above
average
ignoring
the
style
id
recommend
it
to
any
fan
of
pilsners
pours
a
very
clear
and
very
pale
golden
color
with
one
massive
white
head
the
smell
of
cooked
veggies
and
a
light
black
peppery
hop
is
the
dominant
aroma
here
very
nice
the
taste
reveals
more
of
the
black
pepperyspiced
hop
bite
and
light
grainy
malt
and
a
lightly
sweetened
corn
this
light
to
medium
bodied
pils
drinks
down
pretty
easy
and
finishes
crisp
and
watery
clean
very
good
brew
cheers
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
white
fluffy
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
grain
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
a
very
crisp
fresh
taste
with
a
sweet
maltiness
up
front
and
the
hops
making
for
a
bitter
finish
a
medium
mouth
feel
with
very
good
carbonation
this
is
the
first
real
pilsner
ive
tried
and
i
wasnt
real
impressed
but
i
did
not
dislike
it
another
solid
brew
from
new
belgium
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipate
into
a
nice
lace
fresh
grains
dominate
the
aroma
with
some
malty
notes
a
bit
spicy
on
the
tongue
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
finish
is
crisp
and
refreshing
one
of
the
best
of
the
new
belgium
brewing
line
of
beers
on
the
pour
the
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
an
impressive
head
that
is
brilliant
white
with
the
residual
lace
a
fine
sheet
to
cling
mightily
to
the
glass
nose
is
malt
clean
crisp
as
most
lagerspils
seem
to
be
front
is
malt
and
slightly
sweet
the
top
skinny
the
finish
has
a
splendid
hop
presence
pleasingly
carbonated
droughty
long
lasting
aftertaste
im
a
big
fan
of
new
belgium
and
proudly
say
that
this
is
one
of
a
handful
of
lagerspils
that
i
actually
like
new
belgiums
blue
paddle
pilsener
lager
is
a
full
flavored
lager
that
goes
well
with
a
good
chicago
style
hot
dog
and
all
the
trimmings
or
any
number
of
food
groups
and
even
by
its
self
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
pilsners
but
this
beer
is
quality
all
the
way
the
color
is
a
nice
golden
clear
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
inviting
the
smooth
body
supports
a
bold
spicy
hop
presence
with
a
dry
malt
character
the
light
lingering
bitterness
finishes
off
a
tasty
interpretation
i
found
this
pilsner
crisp
and
refreshing
it
has
the
appearance
and
functions
of
what
you
should
expect
in
a
pilsner
a
formidable
head
lace
remains
good
number
of
bubbles
i
really
like
this
beer
it
might
be
a
broken
record
for
me
but
new
belgium
makes
a
great
freakin
beer
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
the
large
initial
head
settles
into
a
thin
but
tight
and
stubborn
one
that
leaves
a
very
attractive
lace
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
very
light
golden
hue
that
approaches
a
straw
color
the
spicy
lemon
zest
like
unskunked
saaz
aroma
is
quite
enjoyable
a
very
clean
noble
hop
bitterness
and
prickly
carbonation
hits
the
palette
at
first
but
a
smooth
and
mildly
biscuity
graininess
quickly
ensues
and
provides
for
a
well
balanced
experience
all
around
the
mouthfeel
and
malt
profile
is
just
a
tad
lacking
when
compared
to
good
unskunked
european
pilsners
in
any
case
ill
take
this
to
a
skunked
and
poorly
traveled
import
any
day
blue
pabble
is
quite
refreshing
and
crisp
this
reminded
me
of
many
of
the
european
lagerpils
offerings
i
was
impressed
with
its
very
fresh
taste
and
hoppy
snap
on
the
finish
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
a
pils
i
wish
it
were
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
good
stuff
bottle
of
lagunitas

this
is
my
new

i
could

the

this
one

this
one
maybe
an
older
bottle
not
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
i
would
like

be

i
like
the
style
and
this
is
another
good
one
in
a
field
of
many
good
ones
great
brewery
but
not
my
style
golden
pour
with
thin
white
head
aroma
is
a
little
bit
of
funk
i
can
never
put
my
nose
on
middleeuropean
hop
varieties
somewhat
malty
which
saves
it
for
me
very
clean
finish
which
is
also
nice
a
bit
too
harsh
and
the
skunkylemony
hop
character
is
offputting
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
pilsners
arent
really
my
thing
but
this
is
decent
condor
recommended
and
approved
give
it
a
shot
especially
if
this
is
your
style
ideal
place
for
this
beer
on
a
river
in
the
nw
swimming
w
your
buddy
vlad
vlad
thinks
the
body
is
quite
heavy
for
a
pils
but
he
likes
the
musk
the
crisp
finish
i
love
this
pils
hard
to
find
in
nc
but
worth
it
when
you
do
crisp
and
full
bodied
not
your
basic
boring
pilsner
at
6
2
this
pils
has
it
all
cheers
pours
a
clear
medium
light
gold
with
a
nice
cap
of
foamy
white
head
that
has
solid
retention
and
leaves
some
very
nice
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
as
well
with
nice
biscuit
and
noble
hops
the
taste
unfortunately
doesnt
match
the
robust
aroma
with
same
the
qualities
but
a
lacking
in
volume
the
body
isnt
too
heavy
and
has
a
nice
little
bit
of
carbonation
on
the
finish
if
the
flavor
were
dialed
up
a
little
more
this
would
be
a
knockout
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
one
of
my
favorite
pils
lots
of
spicy
hop
zest
with
a
biscuit
malt
flavors
which
works
well
crisp
and
refreshing
my
least
favorite
beer
from
lagunitas
i
dont
know
if
my
palate
has
been
permanently
soured
by
the
excess
of
bmc
youth
but
this
really
just
tasted
like
a
macro
in
which
the
brewer
paid
attention
to
flavor
instead
of
marketing
this
would
not
be
my
first
alcohol
injury
i
cannot
appreciate
fine
and
very
expensive
tequilas
either
for
reasons
you
can
pretty
well
figure
out
very
good
pils
had
better
a
good
refreshing
beer
avg
pils
taste
moderate
bitter
avg
beer
its
yucky
and
really
gross
very
refreshing
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
nothing
bad
going
on
really
but
also
not
much
going
on
at
all
somewhat
impressive
for
6
2
neither
the
malts
or
the
hops
are
intriguing
enough
to
bring
the
beer
from
decent
to
good
o
very
smooth
golden
carbination
poured
into
right
glassware
leaving
fluff
of
foam
soggy
cereal
scent
seems
too
overpowering
tastes
of
malt
hoppy
pilsner
was
not
too
appealing
at
first
temerature
was
not
low
enough
overall
not
my
favorite
choice
for
pilsner
pale
golden
color
under
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
aroma
has
a
quality
warm
pils
malt
character
topped
with
spicy
hops
floral
grass
and
crackers
flavor
is
similar
leaning
towards
the
malty
side
though
there
is
a
nice
leafy
saaz
hoppiness
and
a
bit
of
lager
yeast
mediumlight
bodied
and
crisp
this
is
always
a
pretty
good
bet
for
a
solid
drinkin
beer
they
nail
the
malt
character
pretty
well
though
i
wish
the
spicy
hop
was
a
little
more
potent
very
decent
pils
a
tiny
bit
on
the
malty
side
but
good
bitterness
and
nice
smooth
finish
not
as
aggresive
as
some
of
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewer
but
still
well
made
and
will
not
disappoint
seems
to
me
it
would
make
a
good
hot
weather
beer
tried
every
craft
brewed
pilsner
i
could
find
this
summer
and
the
lagunitas
pils
was
the
winner
its
a
solid
pils
an
excellent
beer
the
price
is
high
but
so
is
the
quality
one
of
the
best
pilsner
lagers
pairs
well
with
steak
or
chicken
pils
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
big
lacing
head
there
is
a
very
balcned
but
bold
hoppy
and
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
same
strong
big
crisp
malts
a
strong
hoppy
flavor
nice
strong
flavor
good
body
overall
its
a
very
good
strong
pils
good
stab
at
the
style
just
needs
a
hair
more
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
maybe
a
bit
more
attenuation
abv
is
a
bit
high
at
6
3
bitter
and
sharp
and
delicious
and
now
on
tap
at
your
local
cafeteria
right
now
second
only
to
mamas
lil
yella
in
the
craft
pilsner
scene
thoroughly
ejoyed
overall
does
well
to
convert
the
bmc
crowd
not
overly
grassy
and
astringent
with
the
saaz
as
to
turn
them
off
prosit
good
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
bit
of
extra
hops
in
your
pils
tastes
like
a
pils
taste
hoppy
but
not
too
hoppy
subtle
slight
bitterness
fantastic
introduction
to
pilsners
if
youve
never
had
one
okay
this
beer
is
good
but
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
first
the
head
is
great
long
lasting
and
sticky
shows
great
lacing
on
the
glass
the
pilsner
glass
is
filled
top
to
bottom
with
the
residual
from
the
head
aroma
is
decent
getting
a
lot
of
hops
up
front
malts
are
nonexistent
nice
golden
hue
the
taste
is
a
little
rough
if
you
like
a
lot
of
bitterness
from
your
pils
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
i
prefer
a
smoother
pils
for
my
palate
if
they
toned
down
the
bitterness
i
would
have
scored
this
beer
higher
not
much
to
knock
on
this
beer
a
decent
take
on
a
czech
pils
at
this
price
there
are
better
options
another
point
for
this
beer
is
the
alcohol
content
6
does
not
take
too
many
of
these
to
get
trashed
this
beer
is
the
party
animal
of
the
pilsner
world
it
says
f
u
to
the
rest
im
doing
things
my
way
its
the
rebellious
child
you
cant
control
i
would
definitely
get
again
if
i
want
a
pils
thats
hardcore
and
to
the
point
nothing
hidden
on
this
one
good
pils
this
is
a
good
easydrinker
seems
pretty
true
to
style
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
on
a
summer
day
easy

it

it

to
effervesce
on

hence
it

the

unfortunately
it

it
begins
with
a
slightly

the

the
finish
is

with
a
low
level
lingering
bitterness
with
notes

very
good
but
not
quite
outstanding
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
rated
higher
than
it
is
if
it
wasnt
for
the
overwhelming
sweetness
of
the
malt
aside
from
that
the
beer
is
pretty
good
and
is
something
id
recommend
for
those
looking
to
get
into
craft
lagers
pours
a
bright
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
good
2finger
white
foamy
head
that
lasts
a
good
while
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
some
in
rings
even
a
good
amount
of
bubbles
streaming
up
from
the
bottle
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
malt
and
yeast
much
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
it
is
hard
to
pin
point
besides
the
malt
and
yeast
starts
out
sweet
then
ends
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
not
to
hoppy
though
crisp
and
fullbodied
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
bright
pale
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
frothy
head
of
large
bubbles
the
smell
is
very
malty
and
a
bit
yeasty
for
not
at
all
the
bright
clean
aromas
that
id
expect
from
a
pils
giving
it
another
sniff
reveals
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
but
nothing
all
that
distinct
or
punchy
i
have
no
idea
whats
going
on
in
the
taste
of
this
one
very
malty
with
a
lot
of
caramels
and
biscuit
flavors
overall
a
bit
sweet
with
only
a
touch
of
bitterness
from
a
bland
hoppiness
that
barely
serves
i
find
that
im
having
a
hard
time
getting
over
how
sweet
this
beer
is
however
the
sweetness
does
fade
in
the
finish
which
is
rounded
out
by
some
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
few
seconds
generally
this
beer
is
a
little
slick
and
probably
not
carbonated
enough
for
the
style
although
it
could
just
be
weighed
down
by
everything
else
going
on
in
there
overall
its
ok
but
i
cant
say
that
id
recommend
it
i
cant
find
any
reviews
talking
about
mostly
naked
girls
here
anyway

alone

suggest
at
least
a
sixpack
for
any
of
the
above
aroma
was
hard
for
me
to
pick
up
grass
notes
prevalent
but
really
couldnt
get
anything
else
it
does
smell
fresh
though
which
is
good
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
light
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
all
around
enjoyable
had
this
after
a
long
hot
day
and
it
just
hit
the
spot
this
is
a
simple
straightforward
and
wellexecuted
pilsner
clean
crisp
wet
crackery
malts
noble
hops
to
the
bitter
and
dry
side
but
not
overly
aside
from
the
dms
very
close
to
style
diacetyl
is
not
evident
but
low
levels
are
part
of
the
style
easy
drinking
and
thirst
quenching
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
sessionable
even
with
the
abv
props
to
them
for
brewing
us
a
decent
lager
but
i
can
think
of
10
pilseners
i
like
better
very
smooth
but
with
plenty
of
flavor
nice
o
fairly
well
made
as
far
as
pils
go
very
clean

i
always
prefer

i
really
loved
this
beer
a
year
ago
when
i
was
first
embarking
on
my
journey
of
love
of
craft
beers
im
very
curious
to
see
if
i
like
it
as
much
now
that
i
have
experienced
so
many
other
great
offerings
the
pour
is
quite
handsome
and
classic
to
the
style
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
thick
and
lasting
white
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
belgian
yeast
and
biscuit
malts
with
hints
of
pepper
and
vanilla
there
is
also
a
slightly
hoppy
aroma
but
not
the
west
coast
hops
ive
come
to
expect
from
lagunitas
but
instead
the
classic
noble
hops
of
the
olde
world
it
sips
very
light
and
clean
quite
refreshing
on
the
palate
this
could
definitely
be
enjoyed
after
a
long
days
work
or
on
a
hot
summers
day
the
flavor
screams
europe
with
a
bit
more
hop
bite
than
one
expects
from
a
czech
style
pilsner
there
is
a
lot
of
sweet
funky
belgian
yeast
as
well
as
biscuit
malts
and
hints
of
spice
and
hops
it
is
definitely
light
and
refreshing
on
the
palate
this
isnt
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
from
before
i
got
into
craft
beer
but
still
a
very
nice
offering
and
spin
on
a
classic
style
that
being
said
it
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
offerings
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
its
my
least
favorite
lagunitas
and
theyre
my
favorite
brewery
its
not
horrible
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
them
not
that
im
huge
pilsner
fan
anyway
but
there
are
definitely
better
options
even
from
california
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
the
6
2
abv
goes
seemingly
unaccounted
for
as
it
is
very
smooth
and
lacks
any
strong
hops
or
otherwise
alcoholmasking
flavors
the
flavors
that
are
present
are
not
subtle
but
still
balanced
and
approachable
i
would
certainly
have
this
again
and
again
overall
back
in
the
day
before
tasting
the
explosion
of
rich
brews
this
woulda
been
a
primo
dug
it
but
unlikely
to
seek
this
out
too
often
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
tons
of
effervescence
great
head
and
pervasive
lacing
nose
is
bready
with
citrus
and
woody
notes
bread
accentuated
with
a
light
hop
bite
overall
this
is
a
fair
quaff
o
the
flavors
arent
bad
but
dont
stand
out
in
any
way
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
uncomfortable
to
the
point
where
im
beginning
to
wonder
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
keg
i
checked
other
reviews
to
see
of
others
had
the
same
experience
and
hopefully
this
was
a
limited
problem
would
try
again
but
id
take
most
any
pilsner
over
this
regardless
of
carbonation
issues
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
certainly
emblematic
of
the
style
its
a
nice
palate
cleansing
brew
that
refreshes
a
very
well
done
czech
pilsner
delicate
flavors
that
can
either
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
appreciated
or
drank
without
having
to
put
a
lot
of
thought
in
it
well
executed
pilsner
super
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
flawless
i
enjoyed
the
cute
little
blurb
about
ales
vs
lagers
on
the
label
lagunitas
strays
away
from
ale
territory
and
does
a
classic
lager
style
here
and
like
damn
near
everything
they
do
the
result
is
top
tier
the
essential
elements
of
the
style
are
there
but
so
are
some
unique
touches
including
assertive
hopping
as
per
the
brewers
trademark
and
ample
fruity
yeasty
character
that
is
often
missing
from
many
mainstream
commercial
pilseners
pours
a
classic
pils
yellow
honey
amber
hue
with
ample
white
foam
phenomenal
head
retention
and
left
a
boatload
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
my
oktoberfest
glass
aroma
is
noble
hops
forward
classic
czech
hop
herb
and
spice
notes
along
with
some
dried
fruit
like
currants
or
raisins
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
sulfur
like
a
struck
match
but
not
overpowering
or
unpleasant
good
old
lager
yeast
all
of
these
elements
carry
over
into
the
flavor
which
is
fortunate
cracker
and
bread
crust
serve
as
the
backbone
with
some
grassy
green
fruitiness
that
recalls
lime
rind
and
lemon
grass
a
hint
of
red
grape
honey
sweetness
and
creamy
tea
starts
sweetish
but
finish
is
dry
and
i
get
minerals
and
copper
pleasing
aftertaste
and
smooth
body
with
moderate
carbonation
that
does
not
mask
the
subtle
top
notes
but
instead
carries
them
forward
a
grain
husk
sort
of
astringency
reveals
itself
but
does
not
become
dominant
strictly
speaking
the
flavors
should
be
better
integrated
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
great
beer
you
could
do
much
worse
than
call
me
a
lagunitas
fanboy
when
they
do
something
poorly
i
will
call
them
on
it
till
then
prost
or
the
czech
equivalent
normal
pilsner
colour
of
golden
wheat
good
foam
and
good
lacing
the
smell
is
very
breadyyeasty
you
could
taste
the
yeast
and
there
was
some
hops
as
well
the
hops
overpowered
the
rest
of
the
taste
it
was
not
bad
but
ive
tasted
better
pilsners
this
beer
pours
nicely
with
the
sweet
notes
of
grains
on
the
nose
this
carries
through
to
the
taste
where
the
malt
shines
through
and
the
undertones
of
hops
manage
to
balance
the
beer
even
though
its
a
czech
pilsner
i
would
like
to
see
the
beer
balanced
in
the
way
of
the
european
hops
over
the
malty
sweetness
overall
its
a
nice
balanced
sessional
beer
golden
straw
color
with
barely
any
head
whatsoever
slight
ring
leaves
ok
lacing
the
smell
is
bready
and
yeasty
with
light
hints
of
sweet
light
fruits
maybe
grape
or
pear
taste
is
a
good
mix
of
bread
roasted
malts
yeast
and
sweet
fruits
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
and
a
slight
drying
effect
this
was
ok
to
me
i
doubt
ill
ever
have
it
again
but
it
wasnt
bad
overall
just
a
little
more
than
the
mediocre
doesnt
deviate
from
the
style
but
seems
a
little
thin
worth
a
try
if
you
prefer
lighter
beers
that
have
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
them
ive
raised
this
review
ive
had
a
few
more
6
packs
since
my
first
and
this
really
is
a
superior
pils
o
solid
pilz
easy
to
drink
fits
the
style
well
way
too
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
let
alone
a
czechstyle
pilsner
flavor
sipping
beer
classic
pilsner
o
a
worthy
kick
back
and
relax
beer
doesnt
extend
the
boundary
of
the
style
but
its
a
great
football
sipper
overall
good
doesnt
wow
but
its
always
nice
to
find
a
quality
lager
pilsner
even
if
it
isnt
the
most
memorable
of
beers
poured
a
dark
pale
gold
with
two
finger
head
that
died
quick
and
left
some
lace
patches
beer
has
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
but
mostly
some
pilscracker
like
malts
and
faint
citric
hops
smooth
light
bodied
mild
sweetness
and
a
good
pils
malt
base
that
has
a
crisp
dry
edge
to
it
this
crispness
is
noticeable
in
the
mild
bite
of
the
aftertaste
good
balance
overall
just
a
simple
yet
enjoyable
pils
o
solid
czech
pils
and
one
i
would
go
to
again
overall
this
is
a
fine
pilsner
its
true
to
the
style
but
its
uniquely
balanced
unlike
many
that
are
too
malty
and
fizzy
lagunitas
makes
exceptional
products
and
i
am
becoming
a
returning
customer
clear
afternoon
sunlight
color
with
white
frothy
head
that
stays
around
smells
of
spicy
hops
thick
brush
wood
chips
mint
and
evergreen
tastes
of
spicy
hop
varietal
cereal
vague
mint
leaves
dry
with
a
smooth
bitterness
towards
the
finish
and
a
lingering
cereal
note
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
refreshingly
dry
and
a
laudable
take
of
the
czech
pilsener
style
d
this
is
much
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
is
a
terrific
all
around
beer
that
doesnt
really
wow
you
in
a
particular
facet
i
could
easily
keep
this
stocked
in
the
beer
fridge
at
all
times
without
hesitation
an
excellent
offering
from
lagunitas
and
something
that
i
will
surely
dont
call
me
shirley
will
return
to
time
and
time
again
this
isnt
a
seasonal
offering
but
this
is
perfect
for
the
spring
and
summer
seasons
flavors
of
bread
grain
and
some
citrus
from
the
hops
with
the
nose
offering
much
of
the
same
this
is
a
pretty
basic
pilsner
with
good
hop
flavor
but
not
much
balance
or
much
going
on
that
makes
this
one
interesting
and
memorable
its
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
and
the
dryness
gets
away
from
it
on
the
finish
carbonation
is
fairly
low
overall
this
a
well
respected
beer
that
is
pretty
solid
but
seems
to
be
somewhat
overrated
o
a
decent
pils
the
taste
itself
is
good
its
just
a
bit
on
the
light
side
a
refreshing
beer
with
decent
flavor
might
buy
again
but
wont
neccessarily
look
for
it
again
decent
pilsener
but
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
overall
worth
a
try
not
bad
but
wouldnt
be
my
go
to
pilsener
overall
fairly
easy
drinking
and
rather
refreshing
but
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
for
a
pils
o
like
the
toast
in
this
one
gives
a
little
depth
with
the
spice
of
the
hops
o
this
is
not
what
i
expected
the
beer
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
dry
hoppy
pils
profile
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
pils
the
lack
of
a
hop
presence
is
sorely
lacking
lagunitas
has
yet
to
disappoint
love
their
distinctive
old
timey
stubby
bottles
too
i
have
another
fine
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
to
review
soon
when
i
had
one
in
may
i
was
not
yet
writing
reviews
on
ba
i
am
also
looking
forward
to
maximus
and
censored
oh
and
undercover
investigation
shutdown
ale
is
another
lovely
one
i
want
to
review
here
which
i
also
had
before
ba
and
which
suddenly
seems
to
be
hard
to
find
on
local
shelves
overall
a
nice
pilsner
o
ive
had
trouble
getting
into
czech
pilsners
but
there
have
been
some
takes
on
the
style
that
ive
liked
this
not
being
one
of
them
certainly
the
weakest
beer
in
lagunitass
lineup
o
while
this
is
pretty
good
lagunitas
didnt
fully
nail
this
one
the
drinkability
is
top
notch
but
in
other
aspects
balance
finesse
subtlety
i
think
the
mark
was
missed
id
definitely
give
this
a
second
chance
on
tap
though
overall
a
solid
very
malt
forward
take
on
the
pilsener
style
kind
of
surprising
from
lagunitas
but
good
tasting
great
czech
pils
and
a
lager
to
stock
the
fridge
with
for
sure
it
took
waiting
this
long
and
enjoying
this
lone
bottle
from
a
mixsix
to
finally
realize
that
pours
clear
and
gold
with
two
fingers
of
heavy
foam
that
fell
off
quickly
to
some
soapy
lacing
good
clarity
and
has
traditional
pilsner
bubbles
up
bombing
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
dank
hay
grassy
hops
a
little
sour
and
earthy
and
some
cracker
malt
the
malt
stands
up
in
the
glass
robust
but
a
little
heavy
with
the
clean
taste
of
grain
alongside
the
hops
bitterness
body
is
thin
like
a
traditional
pils
and
it
leaves
dry
bitter
and
herbal
it
wasnt
tremendous
or
unique
but
it
is
a
nice
fat
pils
this
beer
pours
up
an
extremely
clear
pale
gold
with
a
small
one
finger
head
some
retention
and
bits
of
spotty
lacing
i
didnt
get
anything
from
the
nose
it
is
as
close
to
odorless
as
can
be
taste
is
fairly
refreshing
the
first
impression
is
a
sweet
malt
with
a
lot
of
citrus
note
leading
seamlessly
into
a
dry
easy
finish
nothing
renarkable
about
the
mouthfeel
im
thinking
this
might
make
a
perfect
summer
beer
when
you
just
want
something
refreshing
without
all
the
big
hops
and
bitterness
o
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
im
still
exploring
different
pilsners
so
this
was
on
my
list
id
buy
it
again
but
im
still
searching
for
the
pilsner
that
will
be
my
goto
right
now
i
am
going
through
a
phase
of
trying
authentic
czech
style
pilsners
and
this
pilsner
stays
very
true
to
its
style
it
has
a
much
deeper
golden
color
then
a
bohemian
or
vienna
style
lager
the
spice
notes
are
quiet
to
come
through
but
once
you
taste
them
your
happy
they
have
used
some
high
quality
saaz
hops
tasty
hoppy
pils
from
lagunitas
their
trademark
intense
hop
bitterness
is
here
unsurprisingly
this
is
a
czech
style
pilsner
that
is
smooth
and
crisp
and
very
drinkable
it
has
a
light
hint
of
hoppynessspiciness
without
being
too
strong
i
think
the
yeast
mellows
it
out
when
poured
it
is
mostly
clear
and
produced
a
lightly
carbonated
head
its
not
as
rich
in
flavor
as
other
lagunitas
varieties
but
thats
what
i
like
about
it
it
has
more
of
the
traditional
german
lager
experience
than
the
american
beers
that
are
supposedly
based
on
german
style
lagers
with
none
of
the
burnt
aftertaste
of
the
imports
and
best
of
all
its
brewed
in
the
heart
of
napa
valley
in
one
of
the
last
americanowned
breweries
more
of
a
sturdy
pils
than
most
which
i
of
course
appreciate
this
pours
clear
radiant
yellow
color
maybe
a
copper
hue
to
it
but
just
barely
the
head
is
frothy
and
rich
and
lasting
although
only
about
an
inch
tall
the
nose
is
grassy
distinctly
czech
on
the
hop
front
and
light
pizza
dough
malt
like
a
good
pilsener
should
have
nice
crisp
taste
with
more
body
than
most
and
more
alcohol
than
most
too
although
you
cant
really
taste
it
the
grains
are
nice
and
fresh
slightly
toasted
maybe
and
the
noble
hops
are
spot
on
summery
and
only
moderately
bitter
awesome
carbonation
really
thirst
quenching
the
finish
is
super
clean
down
easy
especially
when
ice
cold
this
is
a
good
springtime
drinker
not
freakishly
interesting
but
it
is
really
tasty
my
dad
would
adore
this
im
impressed
by
its
quality
but
not
particularly
moved
by
it
also
like
the
wilco
tango
this
is
one
of
the
few
lagunitas
beers
where
the
yeast
strain
doesnt
detract
from
the
overall
effort
hey
thats
2
in
a
row
overall
i
like
my
pilsners
and
lagers
in
general
to
be
a
little
more
crisp
and
refreshing
than
this
one
if
im
going
the
lager
rout
im
choosing
victory
prima
pils
or
stoudts
munich
gold
its
a
well
crafted
beer
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again
still
liking
this
one
its
such
a
different
tasting
pils
that
i
have
to
give
credit
to
it
one
that
anyone
whom
likes
slightly
more
hopped
up
styles
should
try
and
to
think
that
lagunitas
used
to
be
one
of
my
least
favorite
breweries
its
amazing
how
important
retrying
is
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
drinking
pils
it
is
the
right
color
for
a
pils
and
packs
a
nice
combination
of
malts
and
hops
it
lacks
the
grassy
gritty
grainy
aftertaste
of
many
pilsners
which
you
can
consider
a
plus
or
minus
based
on
your
personal
preference
i
could
see
myself
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
taste
is
gentle
with
light
malt
sweetness
and
mild
spice
from
the
hops
with
some
soapiness
in
the
background
and
light
yeast
taste
with
gently
toasted
grain
flavor
and
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
pils
but
i
would
probably
take
or
leave
it
just
an
ordinary
lager
for
the
most
part
its
hard
to
know
how
to
score
a
lager
the
label
is
right
lagers
are
just
so
different
from
the
beers
i
normally
drink
its
hard
to
fathom
that
they
are
both
beer
o
very
strange
and
a
little
offputting
there
are
much
better
choices
on
the
market
than
this
o
overall
it
was
decent
but
no
my
style
of
beer
beautiful
and
drinkable
not
my
favorite
lagunitas
but
a
great
option
for
a
pils
if
you
are
sick
of
scrimshaw
me
o
not
bad
but
im
not
a
fan
of
pilsners
in
general
so
not
going
to
seek
this
out
anytime
soon
it
really
doesnt
have
any
hop
presence
at
all
either
kinda
disappointing
on
that
end
i
like
this
pilsner
its
solid
and
does
a
fine
job
of
matching
the
style
except
its
a
bit
weak
in
the
hop
aroma
but
taste
to
me
is
the
key
and
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
color
is
a
crystal
clear
gold
the
generous
head
has
great
retention
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
behind
scents
are
bread
and
lemon
but
are
a
bit
weak
the
taste
is
mainly
biscuitcracker
with
hints
of
grass
and
citrus
high
carbonation
and
a
slight
peppery
flavor
give
it
quite
a
sharp
bite
there
is
a
slight
bitter
metallic
taste
to
it
as
well
though
not
overpowering
i
think
it
could
benefit
from
a
strong
hop
profile
similar
to
victorys
prima
pils
solidly
good
but
not
spectacular
lagunitas
pils
czech
style
pilsner
3
55
i
know
i
may
be
in
the
minority
here
but
i
have
had
czech
style
pilsners
in
europe
and
this
was
not
anything
like
them
i
could
have
gotten
a
bad
batch
but
this
beer
was
just
plain
awful
it
was
more
malt
than
hops
and
had
a
thickness
that
does
not
typify
a
czech
pilsner
to
me
it
was
not
clean
and
pretty
low
carbonation
the
smell
was
sweet
and
did
not
have
that
nice
sharpness
that
typify
a
pilsner
i
had
a
friend
concur
just
to
make
sure
neither
of
us
had
had
this
one
before
but
it
was
not
remotely
a
good
tasting
beer
i
rarely
do
this
but
i
could
not
get
through
this
one
it
tasted
so
bad
it
was
like
a
really
cheaply
made
grain
dominant
beer
with
a
large
amount
of
malt
if
they
were
trying
to
make
a
czech
style
pilsner
this
is
not
one
if
i
can
talk
myself
into
trying
this
one
again
i
will
give
it
another
chance
but
this
particular
lot
was
really
bad
o
an
ok
beer
clean
finish
with
little
flavor
some
hop
flavor
o
this
is
a
really
good
czech
pilsener
wasnt
expecting
much
given
the
ba
score
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
soon
as
i
tasted
it
its
not
an
incredible
beer
but
its
a
good
example
of
laguntias
trying
to
do
a
czech
pilsner
quite
drinkable
but
it
does
lack
some
rounded
flavors
and
leaves
a
taste
that
isnt
exactly
right
recommended
for
casual
drinking
i
got
this
lagunitas
pils
after
trying
the
sucks
which
i
really
liked
the
pils
isnt
as
good
but
it
is
still
a
worthy
beer
the
color
is
a
cloudy
golden
it
smells
of
barley
with
a
sweet
caramel
mix
the
taste
is
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
crisp
lightness
not
as
bold
and
flavorful
as
gthe
sucks
but
its
a
different
style
this
is
a
good
pils
but
if
i
had
to
choose
id
go
for
the
sucks
every
time
also
on
another
note
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
if
you
want
something
you
can
drink
a
few
of
you
wont
be
disappointed
with
this
beer
overall
i
think
this
pils
will
please
a
lot
of
modern
beer
drinkers
its
hop
forward
is
a
little
more
boozy
than
most
its
pretty
in
the
glass
traditionalists
beware
i
think
i
could
have
put
a
lot
of
this
away
in
my
college
days
when
my
drinking
priorities
were
different
bravo
not
a
bad
attempt
from
lagunitas
to
take
on
this
style
and
definitely
full
of
flavor
and
crowdpleasing
aspects
for
sure
i
would
probably
get
more
of
these
to
give
to
people
that
like
lighter
recipes
with
an
alcohol
kick
masked
underneath
worth
a
shot
for
lagunitas
enthusiasts
overall
almost
a
very
good
beer
the
taste
needs
a
little
more
balance
instead
of
everything
being
jumbled
together
and
hard
to
pick
apart
i
rated
this
beer
55
on
untappd
the
first
time
i
had
it
not
sure
when
that
was
but
i
am
giving
it
the
same
rating
again
today
it
looks
boring
in
the
glass
but
the
saaz
hops
really
make
this
a
powerful
and
delicious
brew
the
founder
of
the
brewing
company
thinks
this
is
the
best
beer
they
make
he
might
be
right
drink
this
fresh
drink
this
cold
and
enjoy
bottoms
up
people
it
pours
a
nice
clear
gold
the
head
is
white
a
fluffy
almost
mallowlike
the
lacing
is
practically
nonexistent
lots
of
grassy
malt
aromas
and
bread
dominate
the
nose
with
a
touch
citrusy
hops
relatively
low
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
the
hops
show
some
more
in
the
flavor
but
malt
is
the
highlight
of
this
one
the
finish
does
have
some
nice
bitterness
to
it
hmmm
it
fails
to
wow
me
but
im
far
from
dissapointed
oh
its
ok
but
not
their
best
effort
as
far
as
a
czech
pils
is
concerned
this
one
is
a
little
high
on
the
abv
and
low
on
the
citrus
flavour
it
poured
a
nice
pale
yellow
colour
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
light
hop
aroma
i
drank
it
and
felt
like
it
just
wasnt
onpar
with
the
other
brews
from
these
guys
which
you
should
all
be
aware
are
some
of
the
best
craft
brews
on
the
market
today
i
would
probably
pair
this
one
with
a
nice
summer
salad
or
some
old
cheddar
to
increase
its
character
it
is
one
heck
of
a
lot
better
than
any
macro
but
its
still
not
the
best
czech
pils
ive
had
o
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
i
love
lagunitas
so
figured
id
give
it
a
go
its
a
good
beer
relatively
solid
representation
of
a
pils
pale
goldenstraw
colored
beer
with
a
thick
white
head
aroma
is
quite
grainy
and
cerealish
with
a
soft
herbal
hoppiness
a
bit
floral
and
lightly
noble
in
character
flavor
is
quite
nondescript
though
pale
malt
soft
bitterness
and
a
light
floral
character
as
a
pale
lager
it
works
but
its
one
of
lagunitas
weaker
brews
lagunitas
delivers
again
this
pils
is
perfect
in
color
straw
but
just
enough
color
to
be
interesting
nose
is
very
nice
with
faint
spice
of
hop
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
the
style
a
bit
thin
but
good
crisp
dry
ill
have
another
excited
to
see
more
of
their
offerings
pop
up
around
me
overall
drinkibality
too
sweet
for
me
overall
a
pleasing
pilsener
but
i
prefer
several
from
european
breweries
nonetheless
it
would
be
quite
pleasant
during
the
summer
oda
pretty
nice
pils
by
lagunitas
not
my
favorite
style
and
not
my
favorite
lagunitas
brew
but
its
tasty
and
it
goes
down
clean
another
success
here
lagunitas
so
solid
so
dependable
flavor
starts
off
sweet
pale
malts
grassy
and
spicy
hops
a
little
hint
of
fruitiness
crispbitter
finish
body
is
lightmedium
well
carbonated
overall
i
was
really
hoping
for
some
noble
hop
flavours
i
was
quite
surprised
that
this
is
just
a
fairly
boring
eurolager
type
tasting
beer
not
what
i
expected
from
the
usually
over
the
top
lagunitas
overall
what
a
nice
balanced
and
complex
czech
pils
great
flavors
very
satisfying
but
without
being
filling
or
heavy
in
the
least
sweetness
is
muted
and
very
complimentary
to
all
of
the
other
flavors
here
highly
recommend
o
a
very
good
americanstyled
pils
that
adds
a
nice
hoppiness
to
the
classic
style
i
recently
had
the
vunderbar
from
smutty
and
these
are
very
similar
except
this
one
has
a
little
more
hop
presence
very
enjoyable
o
this
was
a
solid
pilsner
not
my
favorite
style
but
worth
a
try
12

that

to
a
nice

that
lingers
some
decent
spotty
lacing
on

after

overall
this
is
a
very
nice

nice
amounts
of
flavor
with
good
balance
and
very
smooth
to
drink
really
crisp
and
enjoyable
o
a
descent
take
on
the
pilsner
style
although
overall
this
brew
falls
short
a
refreshing
drink
for
a
warm
day
cheers
taste
there
is
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
that
fades
into
a
bitterness
that
actually
has
a
really
nice
floral
type
finish
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
i
actually
liked
the
floral
aspect
a
great
take
on
a
czechstyle
pilsner
bone
dry
with
a
nice
sharp
acidity
on
the
mouthfeel
refreshing
saaz
hops
are
the
star
here
and
are
forward
on
the
pallet
pleasantly
bitter
and
crisp
with
little
to
no
malt
aftertaste
a
fine
beer
for
a
hot
sunny
summer
day
surprising
for
the
style
poured
a
wonderful
head
with
decent
carbonation
caramel
tones
and
spice
throughout
the
entire
flavor
profile
with
a
fuller
body
than
expected
not
much
in
the
way
of
the
remeniscent
typical
bitey
czech
pils
hops
namely
saaz
but
very
different
but
pleasant
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
i
was
expecting
a
slightly
thinner
body
and
less
caramelspice
a
solid
pilsener
from
lagunitas
nice
bright
golden
body
and
a
basic
pilsener
aroma
its
actually
more
mediumbodied
than
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
style
and
is
slightly
higher
in
alcohol
though
its
not
noticeably
different
as
a
result
there
is
a
slight
spice
to
it
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
with
a
solid
grainy
malt
finish
easy
to
drink
but
not
quite
a
session
pils
o
as
a
beer
solid
and
enjoyable
as
a
pilsener
maybe
off
base
a
little
bit
i
suspect
that
this
has
been
sitting
around
the
store
i
purchased
from
for
quite
a
while
even
if
it
isnt
certifiably
fresh
its
still
a
good
beer
this
czechstyle
pilsner
pours
a
solid
clear
golden
color
with
thin
foam
theres
a
crisp
hop
aroma
with
a
pleasing
biscuit
toasted
malt
aroma
undertone
its
crisp
and
refreshing
with
hints
of
sweetness
rounding
it
out
while
still
remaining
decidedly
light
and
especially
surprisingly
for
lagunitas
toned
down
ive
had
hoppier
grassier
pilsners
pleasing
smooth
and
overall
wellrounded
o
good
value
i
almost
wish
it
were
a
bit
lower
in
abv
so
i
could
throw
back
a
couple
a
night
but
im
fine
with
it
this
is
a
great
postworkout
beer
d
this
was
not
a
bad
pils
but
really
nothing
exciting
the
scent
and
taste
were
fairly
appropriate
and
the
body
was
ok
the
finish
was
smooth
enough
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
only
worth
a
tick
bottle
poured
a
clear
bright
golden
color
pils
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
consists
of
light
floral
hops
with
dry
notes
and
a
lightly
sweet
malt
base
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
dry
hoppy
notes
with
sweet
malt
base
with
light
cereal
notes
body
is
quite
with
a
somewhat
oily
texture
and
some
good
carbonation
interesting
though
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
maybe
even
drier
hoppy
notes
would
have
been
preferable
i
also
dont
get
the
high
abv
on
such
a
sessionable
beer
o
nice
americanized
version
of
the
style
easy
drinking
but
still
packing
a
good
punch
of
flavor
and
bitterness
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
bone
white
head
that
exudes
remarkable
staying
power
smells
of
spicy
grassy
hops
with
a
honey
and
pilsener
maltiness
to
balance
it
out
sweet
grainy
and
honey
with
just
enough
spice
and
grass
flavor
to
provide
some
balance
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
spicy
almost
tart
mouthfeel
decent
pilsner
but
its
not
up
there
with
the
hallmarks
of
the
style
id
like
to
see
a
richer
maltiness
to
play
against
the
aggressive
for
the
style
use
of
hops
in
this
brew
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
its
sessionalbe
drinkable
and
smooth
its
worth
checking
out
overall
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
so
far
o
a
pretty
good
pils
although
not
as
interesting
as
the
victory
prima
pils
i
had
recently
still
a
good
refreshing
beer
after
todays
long
hike
12
ounce
short
bottle
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
with
the
pilsner
style
which
is
typically
light
in
color
its
easy
to
see
if
the
glass
you
are
using
has
been
properly
cleaned
and
im
a
bit
ashamed
to
admit
that
my
glass
doesnt
pass
the
test
thats
my
fault
not
the
brewers
the
beer
pours
a
nearly
brilliant
light
gold
with
wave
upon
wave
of
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
most
pilsner
style
beers
are
really
light
in
color
but
this
one
is
darker
than
those
that
im
used
i
got
sort
of
aggro
with
my
pour
but
alas
i
dont
get
an
real
sort
of
head
i
do
however
manage
to
overpour
and
spill
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
bummer
i
like
a
nice
frothy
head
one
you
can
float
a
bottle
cap
on
as
jim
koch
is
fond
of
saying
with
my
pilsner
beer
initial
aroma
is
of
well
hold
on
a
sec
as
ive
managed
to
give
my
nose
a
bath
this
review
is
just
going
swimmingly
i
primarily
get
some
light
candy
corn
malt
sweetness
with
some
flowery
hibiscus
like
hop
character
in
the
background
on
the
aroma
side
of
things
the
hop
character
is
really
muted
especially
for
a
beer
thats
done
in
the
czech
pilsner
style
the
hops
in
the
first
taste
are
both
in
the
front
and
rear
malt
flows
through
the
middle
theres
a
nice
bitterness
but
its
very
mild
and
low
key
not
surprisingly
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
with
ample
carbonation
i
get
a
little
bit
of
carbonic
bite
with
this
beer
but
its
not
unpleasant
and
not
surprising
given
the
carbonation
levels
the
carbonation
sweeps
in
quickly
ridding
your
mouth
of
the
beer
before
you
have
a
chance
to
ponder
what
else
it
may
hold
i
think
thats
a
good
thing
as
the
beer
has
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sweetness
and
without
the
carbonation
levels
this
could
end
up
cloying
sweetness
may
also
be
coming
from
the
alcohol
as
at
6
2
this
is
bordering
on
a
1
5x
pilsner
that
may
be
also
why
im
getting
some
sweetness
out
of
it
kudos
for
keeping
the
phenolics
out
of
this
one
instead
it
goes
down
quick
and
easy
lawnmower
beer
seems
like
too
lazy
a
descriptor
so
im
left
searching
for
something
else
lavender
hops
yield
to
candy
corn
sweetness
before
both
are
quickly
evaporated
in
a
wave
of
carbonation
that
leaves
a
lingering
slightly
sulfuric
afterfinish
id
like
a
bit
more
hops
in
this
one
especially
in
the
nose
as
they
are
there
but
they
play
a
supporting
role
to
the
sweet
malt
profile
not
a
badly
done
beer
but
there
are
other
pilsners
out
there
that
i
prefer
o
a
great
beer
that
is
maybe
my
new
favorite
pils
or
perhaps
tied
with
noble
pils
overall
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
especially
here
in
the
warming
late
spring
months
the
taste
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
though
it
seems
pretty
accurate
to
style
for
a
6
pilsner
it
is
pretty
smooth
grains
are
about
as
light
as
possible
and
the
hops
take
on
a
bitter
refreshing
tone
little
touch
of
lager
yeast
plays
nicely
with
the
hop
flavors
on
the
dry
side
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
bold
on
a
fresh
palate
but
gets
lost
after
a
couple
flavorful
ales
its
different
thats
for
sure
and
well
worth
a
try
i
will
buy
another
sixer
as
this
one
disappeared
from
my
fridge
with
the
quickness
especially
knowing
i
might
have
to
wait
another
3
years
before
it
shows
up
around
here
again
it
is
nice
to
have
a
relatively
normal
beer
from
lagunitas
this
is
certainly
a
tad
more
bitter
than
most
pilsners
and
also
has
a
steeper
abv
but
they
did
it
well
by
getting
the
bitterness
up
there
to
not
make
such
a
sweet
beer
which
i
feel
they
are
guilty
of
often
solid
offering
o
really
solid
pilsner
no
surprise
considering
lagunitas
track
record
o
a
decent
americanized
version
of
the
czech
classic
not
something
i
will
seek
out
all
the
time
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
see
this
hitting
the
spot
this
was
a
good
pils
but
it
wasnt
anything
too
spectacular
to
me
it
has
a
pretty
good
body
aroma
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
the
mouthfeel
was
kinda
empty
to
me
it
could
probably
use
a
tiny
bit
more
base
malt
it
was
just
kinda
bland
other
than
that
it
would
make
for
a
great
hot
day
beer
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
this
summer
while
not
quite
to
style
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
would
go
well
with
pretzels
and
a
lazy
afternoon
cheers
o
pilsners
arent
known
for
complexity
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
very
delicious
and
refreshing
overall
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
but
this
one
is
solid
allaround
pours
cloudy
amber
orange
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
there
are
some
wheat
coriander
and
citrus
scents
in
the
mix
rather
lighter
in
volume
and
fruity
the
sweet
flavors
of
citrus
and
wheat
are
the
most
noticeable
slightly
dry
after
taste
that
finishes
a
little
chalky
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
being
a
lagunitas
product
but
this
still
was
decent
and
would
make
for
a
great
summer
drinking
beer
o
great
example
of
the
style
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pils
because
i
havent
had
the
proper
examples
of
the
style
but
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
clear
yelloworange
amber
with
a
thin
medium
white
head
without
retension
bu
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
light
aroma
of
grain
and
light
malt
taste
is
grainy
with
light
malt
but
finishing
with
a
mild
hops
presence
that
lingers
as
a
herbal
almost
floral
hop
taste
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
overall
pretty
understated
but
i
really
like
the
finish
on
this
one
and
would
be
happy
to
have
it
again
an
average
decent
pilsner
redeemed
by
the
hop
finish
o
refreshing
but
it
could
be
crisper
and
needs
more
carbonation
zing
it
has
a
nice
creamy
finish
but
the
finish
can
have
a
slight
metallic
taste
it
does
have
a
pretty
color
this
beer
is
great
with
ramen
overall
a
note
a
dud
from
a
brewer
i
enjoy
very
much
o
nice
solid
pils
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
above
others
for
me
i
didnt
love
the
fermentation
it
didnt
seem
quite
as
pure
lagery
to
me
i
thought
i
got
more
esters
than
normal
for
a
lager
o
the
bitterness
overwhelms
pretty
much
everything
in
this
beer
i
would
ease
of
the
hops
so
the
pilsner
malt
can
shine
thru
this
is
a
likeable
mild
beer
it
makes
a
nice
departure
for
me
from
the
roasted
malty
porters
i
have
been
drinking
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
to
have
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
malty
but
overall
its
your
standard
czechpils
however
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
any
of
the
real
ones
in
prague
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
light
with
a
on
of
carbonation
overall
very
drinkable
well
balanced
beer
overall
maybe
its
me
but
this
company
makes
a
great
pilsner
especially
after
trying
a
good
sour

o
needs
to
be
more
bitter
cleaner
and
a
bit
drier
the
head
is
also
more
lacking
than
id
prefer
for
the
style
the
color
and
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
but
the
nose
and
taste
need
a
bit
of
work
overall
decent
beer
though
i
would
recommend
this
underrated
beer
by
lagunitas
it
isnt
the
greatest
pils
ever
but
it
doesnt
hit
any
offnotes
a
tad
rough
but
so
what
it
didnt
eat
my
tongue
up
like
the
extremely
dry
jever
i
will
definitely
be
buying
it
this
spring
to
add
to
my
rotation

my
new
favorite
pislner
wonderfull
o
the
hops
used
in
this
pils
are
supposed
to
be
soft
but
this
is
too
soft
more
aroma
hops
would
better
balance
the
sweetness
and
bittering
hops
ive
read
this
was
an
all
time
top
50
beer
and
was
fairly
disappointed
overall
a
pretty
decent
pils
but
certainly
not
a
great
one
of
the
style
and
not
my
go
to
either
take
it
for
what
its
worth
and
it
is
quite
easy
drinking
too
o
very
solid
pils
and
a
little
more
bitter
than
most
that
adds
to
the
flavor
but
it
makes
it
less
sessionable
ive
had
this
before
and
it
was
much
better
unfortunately
for
this
review
im
drinking
this
bottle
which
is
an
exception
the
usual
nevertheless
this
was
served
at
a
good
temperature
had
a
small
off
white
head
that
shortly
disappeard
and
no
lace
color
is
a
very
slightly
hazy
gold
with
some
tiny
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
bananas
bread
dough
flavor
is
fairly
dry
some
carbonic
tang
a
little
hop
body
is
ok
and
carbonation
is
a
little
light
which
for
a
pils
for
me
is
a
major
hit
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
average
length
meh
overall
its
a
solid
americanmade
pils
it
wont
blow
your
mind
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
a
case
of
this
during
the
warmer
months
would
i
drink
this
again
yes
i
drink
it
a
lot
but
im
conflicted
to
review
this
as
a
standalone
beer
i
would
probably
give
it
a
b
but
reviewing
as
a
pilsner
like
i
said
it
didnt
quite
hit
that
crisp
part
of
a
pilsner
im
used
to
looking
for
o
not
bad
but
didnt
wow
me
in
any
way
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
12
oz
bottle
golden
in
color
aroma
of
flowery
hops
and
somewhat
like
all
lagunitas
brews
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
noble
czech
hops
with
a
spicy
note
and
short
livid
bitterness
really
sweet
base
beer
lots
of
malt
and
alcohol
making
for
a
rather
big
pilsner
tastes
like
most
lagunitas
products
sweet
malt
alcohol
and
a
good
amount
of
hops
not
the
cleanest
example
of
the
style
a
bit
boozy
and
flimsy
it
is
a
decent
brew
however
and
worth
trying
if
lagunitass
product
were
offered
as
a
lager
based
upon
a
czech
pilsner
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
overall
ratings
could
be
substantially
higher
visit
my
website
at
selfhatinghipster
com
for
more
beer
reviews
music
books
and
more
overall
an
okay
beer
and
quite
flavorful
for
a
pils
but
the
hops
leave
too
much
bitterness
in
my
mouth
for
this
to
be
a
truly
sessionable
drink
would
drink
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
a
great
pilsner
good
flavor
crisp
and
refreshing
pours
a
clean
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
czech
hops
and
somewhat
malty
in
the
taste
hops
stand
out
want
to
be
a
pils
but
this
beers
soul
is
an
ale
i
can
taste
it
a
hop
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
hop
in
the
aftertaste
drinks
more
like
an
ale
and
i
dig
it
tgif
starting
the
weekend
off
with
a
lagunitas
czech
pils
and
it
is
goood
the
appearnace
is
a
clear
golden
brilliance
with
good
carbonation
and
white
froathy
head
the
smell
includes
malt
and
grain
common
of
this
style
for
me
pils
dont
blow
me
away
re
smell
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
with
good
noble
hops
malt
and
grain
even
thought
the
abv
is
higher
than
normal
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
definitely
a
session
beer
all
in
all
pretty
average
not
offensive
but
not
top
of
style
by
any
means
goes
down
easily
my
summer
lager
of
choice
ill
probably
rereview
if
i
see
it
ontap
but
at
this
point
i
cannot
recommend
it
o
fitting
with
lighter
beer
categories
not
unique
in
characteristics
and
aroma
lacking
in
complexity
o
a
good
balanced
pilsner
at
6
2
it
might
not
be
a
the
session
beer
it
tastes
like
but
a
really
pleasing
pilsner
overall
a
decent
beer
not
overly
true
to
style
in
any
way
but
ok
nonetheless
not
something
id
get
all
excited
about
if
lagunitas
had
regular
australian
distribution
though
o
i
like
the
beer
quite
a
bit
but
it
misses
the
mark
in
a
few
places
perhaps
i
am
being
too
harsh
a
well
balanced
and
tasty
pilsner
packed
full
of
flavour
overall
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
average
overall
fairly
high
alcohol
content
pilsners
tasted
here
and
there
all
sort
of
taste
the
same
clean
crisp
refreshing
and
maybe
even
a
bite
of
hard
water
drink
them
parallel
though
and
youll
find
a
world
of
difference
where
there
used
to
be
uniformity
stacked
up
against
other
pilsners
the
lagunitas
pils
stands
apart
rocking
the
competition
and
expertly
representing
the
style
lagunitas
pils
distinguishes
itself
right
away
with
its
darker
color
amber
leeching
into
the
golden
color
other
pilsners
donned
freshly
ground
corn
and
pilsner
malt
fill
the
aroma
with
the
notable
absence
of
sulfur
or
any
kind
of
spoiling
from
sun
or
microbe
carbonation
bumps
and
dances
along
the
tongue
while
slight
touches
of
corn
sweetness
and
a
mellow
and
light
maltiness
provide
some
real
depth
of
flavor
this
is
an
excellent
pils
and
my
new
goto
west
coast
summer
drinking
lager
o
refreshing
enough
and
really
easy
to
drink
pretty
standard
all
around
will
have
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
again
and
rereview
as
i
may
have
just
had
a
bad
bottle
a
very
well
thought
out
and
and
put
together
beer
another
great
beer
from
the
folks
at
lagunitas
these
guys
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
a
much
better
experience
this
time
around
pils
pours
a
yellow
burnt
golden
color
with
just
a
whisp
of
white
bubbles
on
top
that
leads
to
nothing
resulting
in
dead
looking
beer
no
stick
smell
is
of
saaz
hops
and
a
earthy
appeal
fresh
cut
grass
and
biscuit
bites
a
big
malt
base
this
comes
off
more
like
a
sub
standard
esb
rather
than
pils
the
light
crispness
of
a
true
pils
is
not
found
here
the
sazz
hops
bring
out
some
grassy
flavor
over
baked
biscuit
from
the
malt
and
by
god
im
even
tasting
some
corn
extract
even
though
i
know
lagunitas
does
not
pull
that
crap
the
feel
is
where
this
beer
loses
me
much
more
mally
with
a
bigger
sweeter
body
than
a
light
crisp
pils
the
carb
is
pretty
dead
as
well
i
dont
think
i
will
be
coming
back
to
this
one
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
colt45
except
with
a
bunch
of
hops
added
seriously
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
pours
a
much
richer
copper
hue
than
youd
find
in
a
pils
but
the
look
does
not
suggest
malt
liquor
the
nose
is
heavy
with
a
grainy
husky
sweetness
the
same
can
be
said
of
the
taste
there
is
also
a
good
deal
of
alcohol
taste
and
some
black
peppery
notes
on
the
finish
the
feel
is
not
crisp
overall
i
dislike
this
beer
quite
a
bit
after
half
aglass
i
feel
like
this
tastes
more
like
a
euro
strong
lager
than
malt
liquor
but
still
isnt
esl
the
aml
of
europe
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
an
outstanding
version
of
the
style
o
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
by
the
outcome
of
this
beer
seems
typical
lagunitas
high
abv
high
hops
and
sweet
malt
overall
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
but
i
am
not
super
impressed
perhaps
i
have
drank
way
too
many
of
the
pa
pilsners
and
all
others
have
a
hard
time
living
up
to
that
benchmark
but
i
find
that
while
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
there
was
nothing
that
would
make
me
reach
for
it
instead
of
one
of
my
go
to
examples
of
the
style
o
overall
a
slightly
sweeter
take
on
the
style
offering
up
some
unique
flavours
the
higher
abv
is
nicely
hidden
on
this
one
and
makes
it
a
bit
more
rich
than
a
traditional
pilsener
i
prefer
the
euro
offerings
over
this
one
but
certainly
worth
a
try
great
hot
day
beer
i
would
continue
to
have
this
beer
around
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
orangeyellow
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
spots
and
blotches
of
lace
dot
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
grainmalt
and
honey
taste
is
of
grainmalt
and
honey
with
the
beginning
and
end
of
each
sip
with
a
bitter
hop
flavor
coming
through
in
the
middle
mild
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
czech
pilsner
and
another
great
value
and
beer
from
lagunitas
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
does
a
decent
impersonation
of
the
bohemian
style
with
a
grainy
crackery
malt
profile
and
some
grassy
almost
metallic
hops
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
for
a
pilsener
hoppy
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
but
then
its
got
this
honeycaramel
note
midpalate
before
a
seltzery
finish
it
tastes
pretty
good
but
its
too
sweet
to
be
a
refreshing
beer
nice
mild
bitterness
tinged
with
grass
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
going
to
supplant
trumer
or
reality
czeck
for
my
pils
fix
overall
this
is
a
flavorful
refreshing
lager
that
is
not
quite
a
true
pilsner
from
the
flavor
profile
to
the
higher
abv
o
this
is
my
go
to
lager
affordable
easily
obtainable
and
wonderful
great
beer
to
have
when
warm
outside
overall
this
is
okay
but
calling
it
a
czech
pilsener
seems
misleading
it
tastes
like
an
american
pale
lager
so
dont
buy
this
thinking
youre
getting
an
authentic
czech
pils
cheers
this
is
not
a
bad
lager
but
a
pilsner
initial
pour
revealed
a
very
pretty
deep
golden
hue
but
head
was
disappointing
and
faded
to
nothing
doublequick
pleasing
but
faint
smell
of
sweet
grains
with
a
whiff
of
alcohol
is
the
first
clue
that
the
pilsner
moniker
is
a
stretch
where
are
the
hops
tastes
like
a
good
hearty
allmalt
american
lager
but
again
the
aggressive
hop
spiciness
of
a
classic
pilsner
is
conspicuous
by
its
absence
like
i
said
this
is
a
perfectly
fine
lager
perhaps
a
bit
unexciting
but
solid
and
satisfying
nonetheless
just
forget
that
its
called
a
pilsner
and
youll
find
it
far
easier
to
appreciate
overall
a
very
good
american
version
of
the
style
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
summer
night
it
pours
a
rich
amber
color
that
is
topped
off
with
a
nice
foam
head
that
quickly
disperses
after
a
few
sips
the
aroma
is
full
of
citrus
notes
that
are
sutle
but
noticeable
right
before
you
take
a
sip
the
beer
hits
your
tongue
with
a
creamy
texture
that
comes
on
sweet
and
leaves
your
taste
buds
with
a
slight
tart
that
punctuates
the
toffee
notes
infused
this
beer
is
especially
comforting
on
a
warm
summer
evening
right
before
the
sun
goes
down
o
started
slow
but
finished
strong
this
hints
all
the
notes
of
a
classic
czech
pilsner
well
worth
a
purchase
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
crisp
beer
that
brings
a
solid
all
around
flavor
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
a
czech
style
pils
far
too
sweet
and
the
hops
arent
snappy
enough
for
me
maybe
its
an
old
bottle
i
can
never
tell
if
its
not
a
calendar
date
so
thats
on
me
otherwise
the
brown
bottle
cant
save
this
one
may
i
please
have
an
urquell
overall
a
good
one
and
done
sampling
tolerable
slightly
refreshing
but
nothing
worthy
of
return
buys
if
other
pilsner
options
are
available
this
is
a
pretty
solid
and
falvorful
summer
beer
for
ale
lovers
overall
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
a
little
stronger
in
abv
than
most
czech
pils
but
it
is
masked
nicely
after
one
im
done
its
a
pretty
good
lager
but
i
wish
it
was
more
like
a
pilsner
give
it
a
touch
more
hops
and
less
malt
and
we
might
be
headed
somewhere
good
starter
beer
for
people
getting
into
craft
overall
i
think
the
alcohol
may
be
too
high
on
this
one
as
it
is
not
as
dry
or
crisp
as
desired
in
a
great
pils
still
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
even
if
it
is
a
little
too
malty
i
guess
this
is
too
far
outside
of
lagunitas
comfort
zone
of
hoppy
strong
american
ales
its
alright
i
still
love
you
bright
amber
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
large
head
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
isnt
nearly
as
impressive
some
citrus
in
the
nose
the
taste
has
floral
hops
a
bit
of
grass
and
too
much
sweetness
in
the
malt
profile
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
but
lacks
the
crispness
i
associate
with
the
style
nothing
about
this
beer
really
stood
out
and
i
think
theres
better
pilsners
around
over
all
if
you
ask
me
four
another
i
would
say
no
thank
you
and
most
lagunitas
are
great
but
from
me
not
into
a
lager
style
i
normally
not
into
but
still
one
of
the
better
of
the
pilsners
o
good
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
but
it
doesnt
out
shine
any
of
the
local
czech
pils
it
was
served
to
me
on
tap
with
a
golden
yellow
tone
and
a
decent
enough
head
that
fizzles
in
short
order
the
aroma
is
malty
up
fronmt
with
a
biscuitlike
and
grainy
scent
as
well
it
came
in
with
a
moderate
body
and
the
taste
also
had
a
nice
pleasing
malty
pils
attitude
with
a
thin
hop
bitterness
overall
fairly
well
balanced
an
overall
good
crisp
drinker
at
6
2
abv
a
worthy
try
for
warmer
weather
that
is
if
i
dont
grab
the
last
bottle
overall
an
ok
pils
there
are
some
others
out
there
that
are
just
as
easy
to
get
i
would
rather
have
though
12oz
bottle
pours
clear
golden
color
with
thin
white
head
decent
carbonation
but
no
lacing
aroma
has
florals
grass
and
some
light
fruit
taste
has
a
sweet
malt
backbone
with
some
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
slickysticky
texture
and
fizzy
on
the
tongue
finish
is
lightly
bitter
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
good
west
coast
czech
pils
pours
clear
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
and
no
laceing
aroma
is
of
bready
malts
body
is
light
and
very
carbonated
taste
is
of
biscutsweet
malts
and
maybe
a
bit
of
honey
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
worth
a
trybut
i
liked
the
sierra
nevada
summerfest
better
o
not
really
into
this
one
o
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
unfortunately
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
noble
pils
glass
no
dating
indicated
on
the
bottle
pours
a
translucent
orangegold
with
a
bubbly
1
5
inch
bright
white
head
head
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
18th
inch
cap
some
lacing
but
weak
legs
nose
starts
out
quite
malty
sweet
for
the
style
with
a
light
noble
hops
presence
coming
out
somewhere
in
the
mix
taste
consistent
with
nose
theres
definitely
some
sweetness
in
the
flavor
reminiscent
of
corn
or
adjuncts
the
finish
suggests
a
kiss
of
hallertauer
hops
and
a
faint
metallic
quality
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
perhaps
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
but
not
unpleasantly
so
carbonation
is
lively
and
pleasant
consistency
is
slightly
oily
a
decent
brew
albeit
a
bit
more
fullbodied
than
i
anticipated
and
not
as
clean
finishing
that
being
said
its
still
quite
quaffable
i
didnt
know
that
the
abv
was
so
high
its
pours
gold
clear
with
some
very
very
light
carbonation
coming
up
after
about
2
minutes
no
head
what
so
ever
nose
is
pilsner
apple
notes
taste
is
some
what
mineral
hops
dry
with
a
hint
of
sweet
hint
of
saaz
and
straw
tastes
better
with
salty
meat
it
doesnt
have
a
husky
quality
which
gives
it
some
subtle
characteristics
this
is
a
really
hard
style
and
its
just
beginning
of
something
fantastic
i
cant
figure
if
this
is
really
made
with
lager
yeast
judging
by
the
abv
seems
like
a
pilsner
hop
ale
almost
not
a
particularly
complex
beer
but
a
rich
enough
lager
with
bold
enough
flavors
that
cooperate
well
and
keep
things
engaging
this
is
a
nice
beer
when
i
want
to
take
an
evening
off
from
blasting
my
palate
with
big
bold
beers
sometimes
you
just
want
something
simple
and
straightforward
but
not
crappy
this
is
a
good
choice
although
there
are
others
d
pretty
high
for
me
i
would
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
good
czech
pilsner
especially
in
a
limited
domestic
pilsner
landscape
m
creamy
low
carbonation
this
is
a
strange
pils
its
awfully
sweet
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
plain
off
still
i
dont
hate
it
i
just
dont
particularly
like
it
an
odd
beer
and
frankly
not
one
that
id
be
likely
to
come
back
to
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
not
sure
if
its
something
that
id
go
back
to
but
it
was
nice
to
try
o
a
solid
pilsner
with
a
bight
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
at
all
a
good
representation
from
the
usa
would
definitely
have
again
overall
this
is
a
tasty
czech
pils
dont
know
if
id
ever
go
back
for
more
of
this
but
nice
to
see
americans
attempting
the
style
well
the
appearance
is
pretty
standard
for
a
pilsner
super
see
through
yellow
and
lots
of
carbonation
man
oh
man
there
is
a
lot
the
head
is
totally
white
in
color
and
is
about
a
finger
and
a
half
in
width
it
looks
pretty
creamy
and
frothy
which
is
nice
and
it
is
hanging
around
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
nothing
special
average
look
for
a
pilsner
not
much
to
talk
about
on
the
smell
smells
like
a
pretty
generic
lager
has
a
malt
smell
and
a
malt
sweetness
on
the
smell
some
light
hop
notes
not
much
else
smells
pretty
standard
but
by
no
means
too
impressive
it
smells
a
little
refreshing
and
probably
tasty
though
the
head
is
still
here
though
impressed
with
that
wow
well
the
taste
is
a
lot
more
than
i
was
expecting
from
the
smell
i
mean
all
the
flavors
are
what
i
thought
they
would
be
but
just
a
lot
more
of
them
i
wasnt
getting
too
much
of
an
aroma
really
from
this
beer
so
i
didnt
think
the
taste
would
be
all
that
much
but
it
actually
has
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
the
hops
are
more
noticeable
than
i
thought
they
would
be
and
the
overall
flavor
complexity
and
mouthfeel
are
better
than
i
thought
they
would
be
the
mouthfeel
is
bigger
than
i
was
expecting
not
a
huge
mouthfeel
by
any
means
but
not
wimpy
either
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
i
dont
know
if
i
can
give
this
a
4
for
taste
just
because
it
isnt
that
great
but
let
it
be
know
that
i
am
very
close
to
giving
it
a
4
lets
say
like
3
9
haha
overall
its
a
lot
more
than
i
expected
still
not
the
best
beer
ever
and
not
the
best
pilsner
ever
but
not
a
bad
offering
good
beer
clean
and
nice
possibly
borderline
too
sweet
for
me
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
had
a
nice
golden
hue
to
the
appearance
with
a
slight
head
that
dissipated
quickly
along
with
the
malt
smelled
slightly
floral
the
taste
was
clean
crisp
and
i
picked
up
a
bit
of
the
floral
note
that
i
got
from
the
smell
overall
its
pretty
solid
ive
been
on
a
pilsner
kick
and
this
hit
the
spot
was
what
id
expect
in
a
nice
pils
not
a
great
beer
but
a
good
one
a
heavy
carbonated
pale
orange
with
an
average
white
head
the
nose
is
spicy
and
a
little
skunky
the
taste
is
true
to
style
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
but
very
drinkable
over
6
on
tap
beach
in
the
background
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
im
thirsty
and
this
goes
down
pretty
well
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
clean
quenching
solid
but
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
m
d
great
aftertaste
of
a
czech
pils
malt
sweetness
that
is
pleasant
definitely
going
to
have
this
one
again
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
large
fluffy
white
head
head

to
a
full

maybe
a

some
grassiness
and
light
crisp
hops
on
the
back
end
body

and
rather
creamy
pretty
smooth
nice
carbonation
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
pils
not
as
crisp
as
an
actual
czech
pilsner
but
approachable
for
sure
drink
it
was
balanced
but
a
bit
malty
and
to
close
to
a
euro
lager
for
me
mouthfeel
drinkability
smooth
and
crisp

drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
tasting
all
the
different
floral
notes
refreshing

easily

and
mildly
drinkable
the
tangy

cloys
slightly

certainly
much

and

than
a
macro
pilsner
a
nice
match
with
spicy
appetizers
d
a
nice
refreshing
pilsner
i
would
get
this
again
lagunitas
pils
is
a
standby
beer
if
you
are
too
drunk
to
really
taste
another
beer
for
real
it
has
some
basic
characteristics
that
make
it
easy
to
drink
like
other
pilsners
its
not
offensive
unless
it
warms
up
and
then
there
is
some
funk
to
it
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
however
out
of
a
tap
when
its
nice
and
cold
i
like
drinking
it
goes
well
with
most
food
not
sweets
though
i
guess
if
you
are
going
to
go
for
a
pilsner
its
better
to
support
a
small
indie
brewery
than
to
just
order
from
the
corporate
beer
makers
eh
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
very
bright
yellowstraw
gold
with
a
thick
hearty
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
as
it
slowly
disappears
toasty
and
cereal
type
aromas
on
the
nose
with
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
undertones
the
beer
is
slightly
sour
on
the
midtongue
and
there
is
a
toasted
grain
flavor
on
top
of
the
malty
backbone
the
beer
is
very
light
and
crisp
and
has
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
the
sour
taste
lingers
quite
a
bit
and
the
finish
just
gets
dragged
out
a
bit
the
finish
seems
a
little
odd
compared
to
the
body
and
aftertaste
of
the
beer
decent
but
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
its
decent
but
there
are
other
pilseners
i
prefer
more
even
if
this
one
did
go
down
easily
ill
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
when
im
looking
for
something
light
and
refreshing
maybe
then
i
will
be
more
confident
in
my
ability
to
identify
a
fresh
bottle
not
as
light
and
crisp
as
most
not
my
favorite
pilsner
but
drinkable
nonetheless
d
this
definitely
takes
more
inspiration
from
the
czechs
than
the
germans
with
a
more
malt
forward
taste
fuller
body
and
emphasis
on
caramel
via
decoction
mashing
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
but
pales
in
comparison
to
the
greats
in
the
pils
arena
i
was
skeptical
when
i
saw

without
being

it

light
to

it
is
a
fairly
decent
pils
however
easy
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
reminded
me
in
many
ways
of
the
lagers
from
chyně
which
while
being
well
made
and
popular
with
many
back
in
prague
simply
arent
my
thing
because
of
the
hefty
dose
of
diacetyl
tasty
example
of
the
style
could
drink
this
all
night
drinkability
a
little
strong
wouldnt
want
more
than
about
2
in
a
night
o
light
colored
beers
are
very
difficult
to
make
well
because
there
is
nowhere
to
hide
errors
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
a
good
one
dont
miss
the
opportunity
this
is
one
of
those
beers
highly
recommend
drinkability
not
a
bad
pilsner
relatively
easy
to
drink
d
crushed
a
bottle
in
no
time
excellent
example
of
a
pilsner
lots
of
bitter
hopping
rivals
their
ipa
drinkable
session
lager
d
great
after
a
hot
day
working
in
the
yard
smooth
and
refreshing
well
balanced
but
underwhelming
i
actually
do
like
this
beer
but
i
will
probably
try
some
other
similar
beers
before
picking
this
up
again
because
it
lacks
anything
very
distinctive
about
it
other
than
being
made
by
a
great
company
a
nice
pis
from
the
west
coast
not
the
best
but
the
only
craft
one
i
can
find
here
and
it
is
pretty
good
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
in
the
aftertatste
but
nevertheless
a
good
beer
d
good
session
beer
for
the
warm
weather
months
and
for
those
getting
there
feet
wet
on
the
craft
beer
scene
d
goes
down
really
smoothly
astringence
hinders
the
drinkability
a
little
even
after
several
swigs
im
puckering
after
every
one
not
bad
at
all
for
the
style
though
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
airy
amount
of
carbonation
a
good
drink
but
not
exceptional
not
sure
id
get
it
again
drink
nice
flavor
and
not
very
filling
d
this
is
one
of
my
first
pilseners
so
it
is
hard
to
say
how
it
fares
against
standards
in
the
style
but
i
really
like
it
and
will
drink
it
again
drinkability
a
good
drinking
brew
for
me
and
one
ill
enjoy
when
the
warmer
temps
come
my
way
overall
quite
a
nice
pilsner
but
lacked
any
quality
that
made
it
special
very
enjoyable
and
perfect
for
a
summer
day
but
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
value
lagunitas
brews
are
worth
the
dough
light
malt
light
bitter
grain
husk
some
grassiness
and
a
long
bitter
dry
finish
very
clean
distinct
flavors
the
bitterness
is
just
that
no
pine
no
citric
rind
just
bitter
ok
but
makes
this
one
a
bit
harder
to
drink
lighter
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
get
past
the
overwhelming
bitterness
overall
not
something
that
i
could
knock
back
beer
after
beer
one
yes
two
probably
three
no
chance
a
very
decent
beer
but
not
quite
my
cup
of
teabeer
light
mouthfeel
and
cleansing
carbonation
make
it
a
very
refreshing
beer
d
easy
going
and
enjoyable
beer
very
drinkable
pretty
solid
pilsner
overall
ive
had
better
but
this
is
a
good
one
overall
a
very
good
beer
it
is
meant
to
be
a
multiple
beer
good
with
food
or
on
its
own
and
sessionable
i
think
that
lagunitas
achieves
this
and
would
recommend
it
the
color
is
a
darkish
gold
nice
aroma
lacing
and
carbonation
are
good
rich
pilsener
flavor
grain
taste
and
a
bit
of
fruit
raisin
and
the
crisp
dry
finish
associated
with
the
style
hops
are
clean
and
crisp
and
very
well
done
this
is
mediumlight
thoroughly
decent
thirst
quencher
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
at
the
beach
tossing
a
frisbee
etc
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
light
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
great
drinkability
and
though
i
would
prefer
a
abv
closer
to
four
than
five
the
5
3
this
beer
carries
is
within
the
range
of
a
sessionable
beer
drink
is
decent
i
dont
know
maybe
i
am
a
little
spoiled
with
pilsners
from
pa
but
this
left
me
a
little
disappointed
drinkability
is
maybe
too
high
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
that
invites
you
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
good
carbonation
and
a
small
white
head
nose
is
mainly
just
biscuity
malts
and
grains
taste
was
crisp
bready
grains
and
a
slight
sweetness
it
had
a
slight
twang
or
bite
on
the
end
very
mild
beer
all
around
body
was
about
medium
and
well
carbonated
decent
brew
overall
but
nothing
special
d
it
drinks
a
little
too
quick
for
the
amount
of
bitterness
but
overall
all
pretty
easy
to
drink
drinkability
it
was
an
alright
beer
a
decent
pils
reminded
me
of
my
days
in
prague
drinkability
quite
good
this
is
a
nice
light
beer
that
goes
with
the
great
comfort
foods
while
providing
more
flavor
to
compliment
them
its
also
quite
good
on
its
own
worth
getting
dvery
drinkable
butnot
at
its
price
point
for
me
i
believe
that
the
best
pilsners
remain
european
body
and
drinkabilty
were
both
where
you
would
expect
them
to
be
overall
id
say
this
beer
meets
expectations
its
a
nice
clean
refreshing
beer
thats
certainly
worth
your
time
very
drinkable
i
would
have
another
of
these
got
this
in
a
growler
and
shared
with
a
friend
was
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
poured
a
light
yellow
with
only
a
one
finger
head
that
did
not
last
taste
was
like
a
belgin
pilsner
not
much
hop
taste
but
good
never
the
less
have
had
better
pilsners
but
have
had
worse
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
like
pilsners
cheers
notes
refreshing
easydrinking
well
rounded
brew
makes
one
wonder
why
our
american
versions
had
to
be
made
even
lighter
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
impression
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
pilsner
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
you
can
get
that
in
a
cheaper
lager
beer
d
definitely
an
easy
drinker
nothing
special
here
but
a
good
sessionable
pilsner
d
drinkability
is
good
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
pils
malt
character
pushing
through
the
hoppiness
it
might
be
sacrilegious
to
say
this
but
this
czechstyle
pilsner
is
better
than
actual
czech
pilsners
it
aromas
are
light
yet
bursting
with
freshness
grassiness
honeycomb
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
small
white
head
taste
is
well
balanced
refreshing
highly
sessionable
d
its
drinkable
but
there
are
better
examples
of
styles
d
of
course
its
pretty
decent
d
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
with
brats
or
burgers
or
just
on
their
own
honestly
this
is
not
that
much
better
that
a
labatts
or
but
its
a
little
smoother
and
nicer
flavor
but
it
hardly
tastes
like
anything
taste
of
bread
followed
up
by
some
slight
bitterness
which
eventually
fades
into
a
slight
sour
note
that
idles
on
the
tongue
overall
a
pretty
straight
forward
brew
that
is
both
highly
drinkable
and
refreshingly
crisp
ive
been
hitting
the
hop
bombs
lately
so
this
was
a
refreshing
change
ive
only
had
the
macro
pilsners
and
was
never
a
fan
but
this
has
made
me
appreciate
what
a
nicely
crafted
pilsner
can
be
like
moderate
body
for
pils
rather
rich
and
chewy
and
grainy
on
the
tongue
touch
of
fruit
and
notable
cereal
grains
nice
full
feel
for
the
style
though
notably
fuller
than
typical
and
with
a
nose
that
lacks
the
typical
european
hop
notes
if
i
was
running
a
10k
sponsored
by
a
beer
company
id
want
a
beer
like
this
i
could
see
it
going
over
well
as
a
beer
to
convert
diehard
millercoorsbud
drinkers
who
like
the
style
as
well
mid
body
adequate
carbonation
good
beer
i
like
the
spicyness
i
may
try
this
again
in
warm
weather
grilling
up
some
brats
drinkability
not
really
to
style
but
enjoyable
enough
to
drink
if
you
dont
mind
a
sweet
pilsner
a
very
good
pilsner
and
goes
great
on
a
hot
day
recommended
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
a
little
too
high
abv
to
be
session
arent
most
these
days
but
it
certainly
feels
like
one
especially
nice
seeing
its
still
summer
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
pils
no
huge
hop
punch
but
just
enough
to
satisfy
a
good
take
on
the
style
drinkability
not
a
beauty
or
aroma
queen
but
the
flavor
grows
on
you
and
turns
out
to
be
highly
drinkable
crisp
and
nice
when
served
cold
with
a
hoppy
flavor
and
low
abv
makes
it
sessionable
not
perfect
and
a
bit
flawed
but
a
solid
beer
none
the
less
i
need
to
get
a
better
grasp
on
this
style
before
i
can
make
too
many
judgements
still
on
the
american
craft
brew
front
sierra
nevadas
summer
fest
may
be
slightly
less
flavorful
but
a
better
all
rounder
making
it
more
enjoyable
d
i
have
heard
a
lot
of
people
saying
this
beer
is
great
they
must
not
have
had
some
of
the
iconic
pilsners
out
there
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
it
isnt
a
good
pilsner
i
paid
8
99
for
a
six
pack
of
this
it
is
not
worth
it
pick
up
some
prima
pils
for
that
price
you
can
get
a
better
pilsners
cheaper
see
sierra
nevada
summerfest
im
gonna
stick
with
lagunitas
ales
a
small
frothy
white
head
settled
on
a
relatively
clear
golden
not
much
retention
and
almost
no
lacing
aromas
are
honey
and
bready
malt
up
front
with
grassy
hops
and
earthiness
to
boot
a
crisp
lightbodied
brew
introduces
grassy
hops
that
i
expect
from
the
style
the
bitterness
of
which
lingers
in
the
back
the
malts
are
really
in
your
face
and
a
little
too
buttery
for
me
refreshing
but
a
bit
unbalanced
for
my
tastes
and
not
what
i
want
from
a
czech
pils
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
bubbly
very
refreshing
flavor
is
very
bready
finishing
slightly
tart
fair
amount
of
bitterness
in
this
one
i
like
it
alot
recommend
clear
golden
bronze
color
with
good
head
retention
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
rush
to
the
top
of
the
glass
earthy
barley
aroma
mildly
sweet
smell
a
little
more
sour
grassy
flavor
followed
by
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
i
didnt
expect
from
this
style
of
beer
good
carbonation
and
body
decent
beer
but
i
think
id
rather
have
a
pilsner
urquell
if
i
were
to
choose
this
style
of
beer
taste
is
smooth
very
well
rounded
nice
feel
on
the
palate
with
a
good
malt
presence
nice
body
nice
carbonation
not
my
style
but
a
nice
easy
drinker
that
seems
fairly
legit
a
decent
pilsner
but
falls
short
of
others
i
have
had
form
overseas
small
creamy
white
hide
rides
on
top
of
a
nice
clear
bubbly
golden
body
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
floral
hop
on
the
nose
slight
acidic
twang
leads
on
the
nice
malt
taste
nice
little
bitter
hop
back
bone
on
top
of
that
somewhat
creamy
but
overall
wet
mouthfeel
would
be
a
very
nice
beer
to
sit
outside
on
a
hot
day
with
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
czech
pils
but
nothing
really
stands
out
d
a
good
level
of
drinkability
character
is
complex
enough
to
keep
me
interested
and
alcohol
is
low
enough
to
keep
me
from
getting
sick
4

definitely
works
for
me
maybe
not
particularly
interesting
but
hey
this
is
a
pilsner
and
this
one
is
beautifully
balancedthe
sessioning
potential
is
through
the
roof
will
seek
out
again
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
pale
golden
colored
clear
body
lively
carbonation
and
small
but
stable
head
a
classic
look
thats
replicated
a
million
times
over
but
there
is
a
reason
why
it
is
considered
a
classic
look
the
smell
was
maltier
than
others
with
some
sweet
corn
and
only
a
vague
hint
of
the
hops
the
taste
was
good
and
mild
but
not
as
clean
as
i
would
have
preferred
a
tiny
bit
vegetal
and
a
touch
of
sourness
evident
hops
were
lightly
utilized
on
the
other
hand
much
more
substantial
on
the
palette
than
the
norm
with
a
lingering
sweet
aftertaste
well
made
and
enjoyable
but
not
fully
style
compliant
drinkability
is
very
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
aint
too
bad
drinkability
is
so
so
since
the
body
is
heavy
but
i
want
something
light
crisp
refreshing
drinkability
is
very
good
d
rather
dull
beer
not
near
as
crisp
as
many
pils
around
pours
a
crisp
clear
yellow
color
with
a
clean
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
ring
til
finish
the
smell
is
crisp
with
faint
pine
and
faint
hops
aromas
a
wet
grass
smell
is
present
the
taste
is
crisp
and
carbonated
its
clean
and
has
small
malt
grain
and
hop
taste
to
it
this
is
a
refreshing
crisp
pilslager
that
is
great
for
the
summer
your
quintessential
lawnmower
beer
its
quite
drinkable
ill
recommend
it
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
d
all
summer
long
great
for
picnics
casual
gatherings
etc
incredibly
refreshing
dgood
and
easy
to
drink
but
characteristics
dont
quite
match
style
guidelines
there
is
very
little
bitterness
to
speak
of
and
this
brew
would
benefit
from
a
bit
more
hops
pours
a
clear
goldenyellow
color
34
inch

an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
decent

cleanliness
and
a
slight

aroma

the
style
of
a
czech

feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
cleanliness
pale
malt
and
a
slight
breadiness
overall
a
smooth
brew
with
a
decent
body
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
excellent
summer
brew
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
featuring
some
great
characteristics
notes
pilseners
are
likely
my
least
favorite
style
i
find
them
kind
of
boring
but
this
one
is
nicely
done
with
a
bit
of
that
sweetness
to
it
while
keeping
the
typical
pilsener
gonna
have
to
have
more
of
this
a
step
shy
of
the
prague
beers
but
very
good
nonetheless
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
had
i
may
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
d
what
decent
pilsner
isnt
highly
drinkable
the
beer
pours
a
solid
gold
color
with
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
fairly
attractive
consisting
of
honey
and
bread
dough
the
beer
actually
tastes
better
then
it
smells
consistig
of
a
faintly
sweet
package
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
honey
the
beer
has
a
nice
crispness
on
the
palate
that
is
attractive
and
gives
the
beer
something
of
thirst
quenching
mouthfeel
otherwise
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
at
most
and
actually
comes
across
as
fairly
light
which
is
pretty
much
expected
with
this
beers
abv
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
i
wish
this
beer
had
a
bit
more
flavor
still
this
is
a
nice
enough
pilsner
style
beer
and
is
especially
good
on
a
warm
day
enjoyable
although
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
to
be
overly
sessionable
a
bit
full
and
thick
for
a
czech
pils
not
necessarily
a
downfall
but
it
certainly
hampers
drinkability
a
touch
if
in
the
mood
for
a
pisner
and
this
one
was
around
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
not
outstanding
but
certainly
enjoyable
drinkabilty
this
style
is
obviously
all
about
drinkability
would
work
great
on
a
hot
day
as
a
session
beer
loses
points
for
the
aftertaste
though
even
though
its
fairly
faint
whenever
i
see
a
new
one
i
like
to
try
it
when
i
saw
lagunitas
i
was
excited
to
try
a
california
style
it
has
a
nice
dark
golden
color
and
is
refreshingly
crisp
i
find
this
to
be
a
nice
overall
beer
to
be
enjoyed
as
a
session
beer
overall
not
bad
an
american
take
on
a
pils
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
it
has
a
bright
gold
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
two
fingers
of
semifluffy
white
head
that
leaves
light
lacing
in
the
nose
its
sweetish
with
a
touch
of
hops
fairly
clean
flavor
with
light
toasted
malts
perhaps
some
caramel
a
light
citrus
note
and
spicyearthy
fairly
bitter
saaz
on
top
of
a
lightish
dry
body
simple
but
a
tasty
american
interpretation
that
makes
for
a
nice
session
beer
well
i
would
say
more
american
style
than
czech
this
brew
does
have
the
general
looks
of
a
pils
but
lack
a
couple
of
key
characteristics
elsewhere
most
notable
is
the
lack
of
noble
hops
in
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
give
me
some
prominent
sazz
damn
it
malt
character
is
also
more
in
line
with
an
mgd
than
with
one
of
the
finer
czech
pils
overall
this
is
relatively
good
beer
thats
very
drinkable
but
just
not
up
snuff
perhaps
its
the
water
in
california
poured
it
into
my
tulip
with
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
and
nice
foamy
white
head
i
have
a
weak
nose
but
not
picking
up
anything
in
the
aroma
department
at
all
except
for
the
slightest
floral
character
the
taste
is
where
this
guy
shines
with
a
crisp
biscuity
malt
and
a
great
floral
herbal
hop
bit
really
great
sipping
beer
even
with
all
that
complexity
id
have
another
right
now
overall
impression
wow
a
fantastic
american
interpretation
im
not
a
big
fan
of
lagunitas
but
this
pretty
much
knocks
the
cover
off
the
ball
what
a
treat
to
have
a
pilsner
like
this
that
isnt
imported
well
done
drinkability
is
a
strong
point
and
will
probably
have
me
coming
back
for
a
few
more
six
packs
throughout
the
summer
a
solid
offering
from
lagunitas
bottle
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
the
head
lasts
well
has
some
subtle
aromas
of
sweet
malts
mixed
with
light
hops
and
some
corn
has
a
decent
carbination
and
a
fairly
decent
mouthfeel
has
a
light
body
the
flavor
is
okay
has
a
slick
texture
and
is
fairly
easy
drinking
ok
for
what
it
is
but
i
prefer
almost
any
other
lagunitas
beer
to
this
style
this
was
a
okay
light
bodied
brew
probably
best
suited
for
the
summer
this
would
have
to
be
served
very
cold
for
me
to
enjoy
d
could
be
good
on
a
summer
day
but
is
only
average
for
the
style
thin
cream
white
head
which
dissipates
relatively
rapidly
no
lacing
more
of
an
orange
glow
to
it
yellows
out
around
the
rims
not
deeply
hued
light
enough
to
see
the
sluggish
bubbles
rising
within
the
glass
bready
nose
of
sourdough
and
baguette
mixed
sour
white
citrus
tea
leaves
and
meadow
grassiness
doesnt
push
itself
on
you
mediumbodied
with
a
hefty
does
of
carbonation
to
keep
it
churning
around
the
mouth
active
palate
presence
more
sour
than
bitter
with
rye
sourdough
bread
notes
and
lemony
bite
pine
and
dried
flower
petals
there
it
takes
awhile
for
the
malts
to
smooth
things
out
still
a
fairly
herbaceous
beer
which
has
a
refreshing
cleansing
side
but
at
the
same
time
leaves
that
sourness
as
its
final
impression
along
with
a
scratchy
tingle
on
the
tongue
overall
a
good
pils
overall
highly
recommended
dont
drink
and
review
refereshing
and
thirstquenching
d
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
pilsner
here
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
for
sure
other
comments
a
pretty
tasty
lagerpilsner
but
i
personally
prefer
a
bit
more
balancing
bitterness
in
a
pils
biscuity
malt
with
a
tiny
bit
of
floral
hops
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
wellbalanced
hops
that
quickly
fades
away
to
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
very
crisp
thanks
to
the
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
that
i
could
drink
for
hours
at
a
time
not
the
best
version
of
the
style
but
certainly
one
worth
grabbing
occasionally
drinkability
easy
to
drink
pilsner
goes
down
smooth
the
hidden
hops
make
it
more
enjoyable
than
your
standard
pilsner
12
oz
bottle
gold
pour
ample
white

pine
citrus

expected
pine
citrus
flavors
with
a
little
biscuit
and
surprising
sweetness
sweetness
lingers
a
little
bit
could
use
some
more
hop
presence
but
not
a
bad
pilsener
at
all
one
of
the
few
i
dont
mind
from
lagunitas
notes
after
reading
what
i
just
wrote
one
would
think
i
didnt
like
this
beer
i
actually
thought
it
was
pretty
decent
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
guess
ive
come
to
expect
a
home
run
every
time
out
of
my
favorite
breweries
however
unrealistic
d
solid
czech
pils
that
is
classic
and
true
to
style
i
find
that
pils
drink
much
better
on
tap
and
this
one
is
no
exception
id
easily
pass
on
this
brew
every
time
if
it
wasnt
for
the
unpleasant
similarities
with
coors
light
this
would
be
very
drinkable
as
it
is
very
thin
and
refreshing
round
and
filling
in
the
mouth
the
best
thing
is
the
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
balanced
could
have
it
all
day
best
ive
had
other
than
new
glarus
try
which
is
great
too
d
its
a
pretty
decent
drinker
slightly
heartier
than
some
other
examples
of
the
style
pilseners
can
be
a
difficult
style
to
woo
somebody
with
this
one
was
nice
but
didnt
do
anything
to
separate
itself
from
the
pack
drinkability
is
great
very
good
beer
and
a
nice
change
from
prima
pils
for
me
this
is
my
second
beer
from
lagunitas
after
imperial
red
ale
and
so
far
so
good
poured
a
crisp
clear
golden
color
with
small
white
head
that
stayed
around
but
did
not
leave
much
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
was
a
bit
floral
but
i
also
detected
a
scent
of
grass
the
aroma
was
however
dominated
by
the
saaz
hops
flavor
was
good
and
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
had
anticipated
mouthfeel
was
great
and
drinkability
was
sky
high
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
i
typically
dont
get
that
excited
about
pilseners
this
beer
has
a
nice
hazy
brass
colored
body
it
had
a
great
two
and
a
half
fingers
of
white
head
but
there
was
not
much
for
lace
it
smells
of
crisp
hops
and
there
are
some
fruity
esters
with
a
mild
aroma
of
grass
it
is
fruitier
than
most
pilsners
but
it
is
refreshing
the
aftertaste
is
crisp
and
herbal
it
has
a
very
thin
but
slick
mouthfeel
it
is
a
great
beer
one
of
the
better
american
pils
i
have
had
i
am
a
hophead
but
this
is
a
bit
heavy
on
hops
for
a
pils
that
being
said
i
would
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
summary
4
55
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
its
ability
to
live
up
to
my
horribly
biased
pilsner
standards
i
may
have
focused
on
its
shortcomings
but
that
is
only
because
they
are
fewer
than
its
accolades
and
this
is
a
review
not
a
novel
simply
put
lagunitas
nailed
the
pilsner
style
but
it
doesnt
create
the
same
pow
right
in
the
kisser
effect
that
the
55
pilsner
urquell
does

d
i
was
using
a
pilsner
urquel
as
my
baseline
and
with
that
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
this
is
a
good
beer
and
easy
enough
to
drink
but
its
no
threat
to
the
czechs
drinkability
i
could
definitely
sip
on
this
one
a
lot
the
extra
hops
really
brings
it
over
the
top
for
me
as
far
as
a
drinkable
pilsner
great
session
beer
for
those
seeking
respite
from
hop
bombs
sweet
and
bready
flavors
greet
the
tongue
moving
into
a
more
defined
malty
sweetness
the
finish
is
a
pretty
spot
on
theres
a
nice
citrustinged
spicy
hop
finish
with
a
good
lingering
bitterness
crisp
nicely
carbonated
and
lightbodied
all
told
this
is
a
solid
pils
from
a
brewery
that
makes
their
cake
on
ales
not
great
but
absolutely
respectable
d
not
a
lot
of
flavor
and
balance
isnt
quitte
right
that
said
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
better
and
more
drinkable
than
most
pilsners
i
have
had
lately
surprising
beer
from
lagunitas
i
didnt
expect
a
whole
lot
considering
how
similar
a
lot
of
their
beers
taste
not
bad
just
similar
ever
since
having
the
new
glarus
unplugged
bohemian
pils
last
week
i
have
craving
some
thirst
quenching
lagers
this
one
held
its
own
and
satisfies
my
urge
for
a
clean
and
flavorful
session
beer
brilliant
golden
and
clear
body
with
heavy
carbonation
and
thin
but
slightly
sticky
layer
of
head
the
aroma
is
filled
with
a
doughy
maltiness
that
is
paired
with
oak
and
noble
hops
nice
and
resinous
but
controlled
hop
presence
the
taste
is
sharp
and
malty
on
the
front
and
dried
out
substantially
on
the
swallow
the
touch
a
crystal
malt
seems
to
add
great
depth
to
this
medium
bodied
lager
not
sure
if
they
put
this
beer
on
oak
but
it
surely
has
wonderful
barrel
qualities
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
example
of
a
lager
done
right
it
is
so
easy
to
get
lost
in
the
hype
and
trends
of
big
beers
guilty
myself
but
somethings
nothing
is
better
than
a
cold
clean
pils
this
one
is
definitely
suiting
for
crowd
pleasing
not
among
my
favorite
pilsners
but
pretty
good
in
essence
the
beer
does
have
characteristics
of
a
czech
pils
bit
it
is
poorly
executed
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
heavy
for
my
taste
this
isnt
the
sort
of
thing
ill
be
partaking
much
of
taste
is
decent
at
first
being
both
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
with
light
toasted
grain
and
hops
that
have
mostly
a
faint
pinelemon
pulp
taste
thus
far
its
ok
but
even
so
nothing
special
or
particularly
interesting
and
is
a
bit
bland
it
gets
worse
and
ends
up
very
bland
yuet
roughly
bitter
with
little
actual
flavour
or
character
except
a
faint
hint
of
old
almost
tasteless
lemon
rind
rubbed
briefly
with
pine
needles
the
feel
at
first
soft
and
smooth
becomes
rough
dry
and
unpleasant
leaving
an
unpleasant
vague
aftertaste
single
from
whole
foods
reston
been
sitting
there
almost
since
i
moved
up
figured
it
was
time

this
is
a
true
to

brew
from
the
l
always
nice
to
get
a
l
brew
very
afforable
and
tasty
d
very
drinkable
would
go
with
just
about
anything
and
is
just
a
very
refreshing
tasty
beer
in
general
as
a
fan
of
pilsners
in
general
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
i
found
that
the
taste
was
sweet
almost
like
a
macro
rather
than
rich
like
say
staroprahmen
the
complexity
too
was
missing
like
spiciness
and
a
muskiness
and
there
was
relatively
low
hop
bitterness
as
well
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
fine
overall
not
interesting
or
compelling
worth
a
try
good
california
shot
at
ze
pilsener
drink
this
with
the
hostess
snowballs
that
come
out
around
st
patricks
day
theyre
green
d
good
pilsner
can
lagunitas
make
a
bad
beer
if
so
i
havent
found
it
yet
d
overall
not
a
bad
example
of
a
pilsener
it
didnt
rock
my
world
but
still
a
well
done
beer
d
same
as
above
easy
to
drink
notes
plain
and
simple
a
decent
brew
good
for
the
last
calleasy
to
chug
and
session
worthy
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
real
nice
thick
white
head
head
nice
nice
lacing
too
aroma
is
pleasant
citrus
fruits
grainy
and
grassy
i
get
a
nice
little
lemon
zing
in
the
flavor
followed
by
grassy
bitter
hops
clean
and
refreshing
solid
brew
d
not
my
favorite
style
to
begin
with
but
most
certainly
worth
the
time
after
all
it
was
free
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
yellowishgold
with
a
slight
haze
foamy
white
head
that
disapates
to
consistent
thin
topping
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
smells
of
grain
corn
muffins
taste
of
corn
biscuits
straw
and
grains
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
decent
body
clean
a
crisp
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
very
drinkable
smells
great
when
opened
but
i
personally
dont
care
for
the
sharp
bitter
taste
i
made
a
cheese
sandwich
to
neutralize
it
a
bit
for
me
this
would
be
something
id
have
to
drink
with
a
heavy
meal
very
good
example
of
the
pilsner
style
refreshing
coming
from
the
land
of
hobomb
ales
this
one
is
full
of
character
and
a
must
for
those
who
are
fans
of
a
good
pils
this
is
probably
one
of
my
top
five
nongerman
brews
and
certainly
top
ten
overall
i
would
give
a
detailed
description
but
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
this
beer
hits
the
mark
in
all
catagoriessmelldrinkabilitytastemouthfeel
everything
my
recommendation
buy
it
you
wont
regret
it
poured
a
dark
golden
yellow
with
a
creamy
nice
head
that
developed
a
nice
laciness
aroma
was
good
a
nice
floral
aroma
of
hops
with
a
hint
of
malts
the
first
taste
was
offensive
very
bitter
and
metallic
i
am
glad
i
tried
to
finish
because
it
actually
was
good
nice
balance
of
hops
the
texture
was
good
on
the
light
side
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
could
be
a
session
beer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
was
extremely
clear
pale
yellow
colored
adequate
head
the
smell
is
sort
of
malty
but
not
too
strong
no
czech
hops
aromas
come
through
the
taste
is
nice
slightly
sweet
mostly
malty
and
a
little
grassy
again
no
major
impact
from
any
hops
that
i
can
tell
very
drinkable
as
a
lager
but
i
guess
i
expected
more
hops
out
of
the
flavor
as
its
called
a
czech
pilsner
not
too
bad
its
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
usually
like
but
i
typically
dont
have
the
pilsner
styles
too
often
relative
to
other
pilsners
ive
had
this
is
one
of
the
more
bitter
ones
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
typically
perfer
more
flavor
variation
it
seems
to
lack
balance
with
anything
else
pours
a
clear
straw
color
smallish
white
head
leaves
behind
patchy
lacing
nice
sweet
earthygrainy
aroma
cut
with
some
pretty
pungent
floral
hops
more
sweet
graininess
in
the
taste
some
crisp
bitter
hops
slight
butter
taste
mouthfeel
is
crisp
maybe
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
pretty
damn
snappy
and
refreshing
i
like
this
an
easydrinker
for
sure
great
compliment
to
lots
of
different
meals
and
really
tasty
had
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
the
drink
had
some
patchy
lacing
with
a
generally
dark
amber
appearance
a
thin
but
balanced
aroma
of
malts
and
hops
just
wish
it
was
stronger
the
taste
was
a
mediumlevel
bitterness
that
was
really
dry
carbonation
was
crisp
giving
it
that
dry
aftertaste
overall
not
bad
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
isnt
very
much
to
this
beer
even
considering
that
this
is
a
style
that
doesnt
get
too
complex
somewhat
sticky
finish
okay
drinkability
as
a
wellexecuted
craftmicrobrew
lager
this
is
head
and
shoulders
above
most
of
whats
out
there
while
ill
have
no
trouble
finishing
this
one
though
im
in
no
hurry
for
another
as
pilsener
is
just
not
a
style
i
grok
however
theres
just
no
comparison
between
this
and
a
mass
produced
lager
bmc
heineken
pbr
etc
lagunitas
wins
the
flavor
derby
by
a
mile
d
very
good
beer
quite
worthy
of
a
revisit
a
great
summer
time
beer
the
flavors
are
quite
subdued
but
in
a
good
way
this
would
be
perfect
for
the
cookout
in
the
back
yard
d
very
very
drinkable
in
the
hot
summers
of
atlanta
actual
residents
do
not
call
it
hotlanta
appears
to
be
no
abv
but
i
think
by
american
standards
this
could
be
a
session
beer
do
not
send
me
beer
mail
about
it
being
too
high
in
alcohol
to
be
a
session
beer
i
cannot
help
it
if
you
cannot
hold
your
liquor
overall
a
good
light
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavor
is
too
subdued
rating
a
beer
like
this
is
kinda
like
the
olympic
judges
rate
a
figure
skater
they
prorate
the
scale
based
on
the
complexity
of
the
routine
thats
kinda
what
i
do
with
pilsners
even
a
very
good
score
may
only
come
in
at
a
b
or
so
where
it
may
get
a
solid
a
if
it
were
a
style
that
exhibited
more
complexity
overall
a
great
anytime
beer
especially
in
the
summer
i
feel
i
am
more
partial
to
this
pilsner
than
others
is
because
of
the
intensity
of
the
hops
which
i
didnt
quite
expect
especially
from
a
pilsner
style
not
what
i
expected
out
of
a
pilsner
but
still
a
good
beer
nevertheless
i
gotta
give
em
props
for
getting
that
much
toastiness
into
a
pale
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
goldenyellow
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
decent
lacing
down
my
pilsn
glass
not
a
strong
smell
steely
grain
and
some
floralskunk
notes
rich
malty
palate
well
balanced
w
a
decent
hop
flavor
a
bit
metallic
and
fruitish
in
the
finish
a
light
bodied
yet
creamy
brew
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
pils
tho
good
co2
may
play
a
part
in
that
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
glad
i
got
a
six
of
this
one
d
very
drinkable
pilsner
enjoying
would
like
to
find
this
one
on
tap
sometime
pleasant
enough
but
this
brewery
could
do
much
better
this
is
what
a
lager
should
be
a
smooth
pour
with
little
head
that
classic
none
watered
down
lager
smell
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
tasting
and
fully
drinkable
lagers
around
the
carbination
is
just
right
as
well
imo
hard
to
find
a
fault
with
this
one
i
have
heard
some
funny
stories
about
this
brewery
with
the
words
growroom
and
shutdown
this
was
a
prime
example
of
a
classic
czech
pils
naturally
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in
my
favorite
grand
pilsener
glass
well
chilled
i
poured
a
sunny
rich
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
it
had
the
nice
spicy
hop
smell
with
some
sweeter
malt
undertones
the
taste
was
well
balanced
as
well
with
spicy
bitter
hops
up
front
and
a
mildy
sweet
malt
finish
that
was
easy
on
the
palate
nice
brew
d
good
drinkability
and
representation
of
the
style
a
nice
lager
with
good
refreshing
qualities
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
very
well
made
pils
super
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
satisfyingly
full
flavor
that
doesnt
tire
or
overwhelm
really
impressed
to
see
lagunitas
exercised
some
restraint
here
this
pilsner
was
quite
flavorful
yet
not
overwhelming
frankly
i
was
surprised
at
how
true
to
the
style
lagunitas
kept
this
beer
my
recommendation
would
be
to
serve
it
as
a
refreshing
apertif
or
pair
it
with
oysters
crab
cakes
or
other
lighter
seafare
overall
i
thought
this
was
really
nice
though
i
have
to
be
honest
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
pale
ale
then
anything
else
but
still
it
was
very
nicely
done
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
would
be
glad
to
try
another
one
of
these
any
day
d
easy
drinkability
it
is
a
nice
beer
overall
but
the
citrus
hop
notes
and
slight
fruitiness
are
a
bit
off
stylistically
for
a
beer
that
is
explicitly
labeled
a
czech
style
pilsner
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
fades
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
weak
spice
aromas
in
the
nose
tight
bubbled
pepper
and
slightly
spice
taste
not
your
average
tasting
pils
light
to
medium
body
tight
bubbled
carbonation
pass
on
this
one
d
the
taste
was
just
terrible
i
think
i
got
a
bad
one
i
may
review
it
again
but
this
was
a
drain
pour
pours
light
golden
and
bubbly
with
a
smallish
white
head
smell
is
apple
juice
sweetened
malt
with
some
light
yeastiness
very
nice
nose
for
a
pilsner
taste
is
bubbly
crisp
and
nicely
tart
malt
nice
bitter
and
carbonated
crispness
in
the
finish
and
just
what
i
want
in
the
mouthfeel
for
a
pilsner
as
pilsners
go
this
is
very
nice
and
a
solid
beer
all
around
although
others
have
rated
this
pilsner
rather
low
i
find
it
to
be
a
rather
unique
pils
it
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
most
of
the
drink
its
nose
is
mild
but
notes
of
floral
hops
poke
through
its
taste
is
crisp
dry
and
sweet
different
than
other
pilsners
which
is
great
but
mild
in
flavor
and
featuring
undertones
of
bitter
citrus
mouthfeel
is
great
crisp
and
carbonated
try
this
pilsner
its
different
than
most
and
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
lager
as
a
selfprofessed
pilsner
nut
im
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
one
the
lifeless
appearance
subdued
aroma
and
mild
flavor
pull
the
score
of
this
one
down
d
a
good
pilsner
but
not
overly
flavorful
understated
which
is
not
usually
the
route
lagunitas
beers
tend
to
go
a
better
aroma
would
have
helped
this
beer
all
the
way
through
the
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
into
a
pint
glass
a
slight
whiff
of
hops
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
that
classic
pilsner
profile
vienna
and
pilsner
malt
flavor
lightly
hopped
with
a
crisp
pleasant
finish
good
carbonation
and
lacing
not
really
a
beer
for
this
time
of
year
but
still
an
excellent
example
of
a
classic
czech
pilsner
i
e
pilsner
urquell
im
not
sure
if
i
got
an
old
bottle
or
what
but
this
beer
disappointed
me
i
read
the
reviews
before
i
bought
it
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
one
to
try
but
didnt
hit
the
mark
with
me
d
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
it
isnt
my
favorite
american
pilsener
but
it
ranks
pretty
well
this
was
a
great
beer
im
normally
not
a
big
fan
of
pilsners
but
this
one
was
rather
nice
it
poured
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
had
great
lacing
the
aroma
was
floral
hops
and
a
nice
malty
sweetness
the
taste
was
fresh
and
clean
had
a
nice
dry
bitterness
balanced
with
a
sweetness
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
drinkablity
was
great
i
felt
like
i
could
drink
these
all
day
too
bad
this
brewery
isnt
available
in
la
overall
a
great
pils
im
happy
to
have
come
across
dry
snappy
clean
and
crisp
with
a
body
that
carries
everything
along
in
an
orderly
fashion
id
be
happy
to
find
this
on
tap
and
drink
many
pints
on
a
regular
basis
good
stuff
interesting
beer
has
great
body
and
is
damn
drinkable
its
about
a
slightly
above
average
fizzy
yellow
water
drink
would
be
easily
drinkable
but
for
the
price
and
comparability
i
would
rather
have
something
else
drinkability
towards
the
end
the
bitterness
has
almost
a
cumulative
effect
and
is
wearing
on
me
a
little
i
like
a
little
cleaner
finish
on
a
pils
though
this
is
a
fine
brew
overall
this
is
a
very
good
pils
and
one
i
would
especially
recommend
to
hop
fans
its
not
a
hop
bomb
or
extreme
but
just
a
good
example
of
a
wellcrafted
beer
chicago
i
dont
know
where
the
low
ratings
are
coming
from
on
this
brew
it
is
everything
expected
from
a
west
coast
czech
style
pilsner
very
balanced
and
a
perfect
summer
session
i
will
try
this
again
sometime
up
against
the
benchmark
pilsner
while
it
may
not
be
perfect
it
is
still
pretty
damned
good
given
how
hard
it
is
to
brew
a
good
pils
d
the
abv
strikes
me
as
low
that
combined
with
the
nice
hop
flavor
makes
this
a
good
drink
one
of
lagunitas
best
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
malty
and
pleasantly
accentuated
by
floral
hops
taste
is
very
nicely
balanced
with
a
nice
peppery
light
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
for
the
style
very
satisfying
overall
drinkability
is
good
i
really
appreciate
a
well
made
beer
in
the
czech
pils
style
and
lagunitas
has
a
put
together
a
very
nice
representation
drinkability
very
but
would
not
buy
again
this
beer
is
too
costly
and
not
near
as
drinkable
as
a
pilsner
should
be
a
nice
west
coast
made
version
of
urquell
not
quite
as
good
as
fresh
pilser
in
prague
though
drinkability
could
put
two
or
three
away
rather
easily
for
a
middle
of
the
road
pilsner
but
would
appreciate
more
crispness
at
finish
looks
about
like
average
beerremarkably
unremarkable
smells
nice
and
understatedrefreshing
in
the
nose
good
balance
in
this
one
with
a
clean
bitterness
that
lingers
nice
effervescent
mouthfeel
a
good
solid
session
pils
good
with
spicy
foods
this
is
a
worldclass
pils
defining
for
the
style
and
full
of
flavor
yet
ohsoeasy
to
drink
i
love
this
brew
highly
recommended
i
will
be
buying
much
more
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
for
most
people
i
think
that
some
might
find
the
upfront
hop
presence
to
be
a
bit
much
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
had
a
very
nice
white
head
with
very
nice
lacing
qualities
it
was
nicly
displayed
the
smell
was
bready
and
yeasty
the
beer
was
nice
and
refreshing
tasting
with
a
pretty
golden
color
it
was
a
tad
sweet
but
overbering
a
really
good
summer
brew
i
will
buy
again
pours
with
perfect
clarity
and
fluffy
soapy
white
head
nose
is
spicy
hops
taste
is
medium
carbonation
with
some

flavour
malts
are
are
nicy
done
finishes
clean
initially
but
an
aftertaste
shows
up
that
is
metaillic
aspirin
like
that
really
hurts
drinkability
not
a
bad
thirst
quencher
whats
not
to
like
here
theres
no
skunkiness
like
macro
pilseners
theres
no
dingy
aroma
of
cooked
corn
here
its
just
a
czech
pils
much
like
the
folks
of
the
czech
republic
would
have
intended
i
love
this
interpretation
of
a
czech
pilsner
from
lagunitas
so
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
time
for
another
six
bright
gold
color
aromas
not
pronounced
but
mostly
malty
fruits
flavor
is
good
but
in
my
opinion
not
very
well
balanced
it
leans
too
much
to
the
bitter
hops
which
is
fine
for
an
american
pilsner
but
this
claims
to
be
a
czech
style
pilsner
the
malts
should
be
more
pronounced
still
a
pretty
good
beer
and
quite
drinkable
overall
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
the
very
balanced
malt
and
hops
make
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
glad
to
finally
see
lagunitas
is
michigan
lots
of
flavor
but
just
too
fizzy
the
body
is
light
but
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
limits
the
crisp
and
dryness
of
the
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
more
of
an
american
style
pilsner
then
czech
i
would
say
another
good
lagunitas
offering
keep
them
coming
drinkability
this
is
a
delicious
beer
appropriate
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
anytime
you
need
your
thirst
quenched
makes
me
want
to
brew
up
10
gallons
of
the
stuff
right
now
drinkability
not
as
easy
to
drink
as
most
pilsners
ive
had
but
not
terrible
lagunitas
pils
czech
style
pilsner
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
twist
off
bottle
the
aroma
is
mild
and
malty
there
is
a
very
light
body
and
active
carbonation
there
is
a
touch
of
malt
and
what
seems
like
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
but
not
much
else
not
bad
worth
a
try
d
a
slightly
above
average
pils
for
me
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
really
special
about
it
to
make
me
crave
another
one
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
turns
into
a
thin
white
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
faint
grassy
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
nice
little
bite
from
the
saaz
hops
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pils
that
is
recommended
for
a
nice
brew
on
a
hot
day
good
cut
stab
at
a
lager
but
the
9
a
sixer
may
limit
its
appeal

however
a
beer
to
sit
down
for
a
sixer
session
you
cant
drink
strong
ales
all
the
time
so
why
dont
more
breweries
come
up
with
more
of
these
acquired
at
the
bier
stein
eugene
or
it
pours
out
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
thick
bubbly
white
head
its
very
effervescent
and
clear
the
smell
is
distinctly
yeasty
with
some
fruity
hops
the
taste
is
surprisingly
nice
and
refreshing
with
a
complex
blend
of
fruity
hops
to
the
palate
and
isnt
dominated
by
a
yeast
taste
thats
prevalent
in
the
smell
im
not
normally
a
pilsner
drinker
but
this
would
be
great
one
to
have
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
just
youre
run
of
the
mill
89
dollar
pilsner
here
solid
offerning
but
nothing
that
blows
my
mind
i
like
the
schell
better
oelergud
pours
a
dark
golden
approaching
amber
a
little
darker
than
most
czech
style
pilsners
good
hhead
that
sticks
around
as
a
cap
and
leaves
very
good
lacing
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
and
with
quite
tangy
yeast
more
than
it
exhibits
any
real
hop
presence
its
there
at
the
end
as
some
earthy
hops
but
not
predominant
taste
is
hoppier
but
still
dominated
by
a
tangy
yeastiness
sharp
floral
and
earthy
hops
then
the
tanginess
and
a
finish
of
a
decent
bitterness
malt
is
more
subdued
here
but
it
doesnt
seem
greatly
balanced
and
seems
a
little
tangy
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
pretty
substantial
for
a
pisner
and
the
finish
is
more
tannic
than
crisp
a
decent
pilsner
but
not
anything
to
write
home
about
there
are
better
out
there
and
this
one
just
doesnt
refresh
as
i
like
a
pilsner
to
do
bigger
and
bolder
than
most
pilsners
is
okay
but
balance
that
with
some
more
crispness
and
cut
the
yeastiness
drinkability
a
fine
drinkable
lil
pils
czech
it
out
a
nice
yellowgold
color
with
a
thick
head
very
active
carbonation
aroma
was
not
real
strong
a
little
lemon
sweetness
first
taste
was
pretty
light
and
crisp
but
there
is
a
spice
quality
that
builds
and
you
sense
more
of
the
alcohol
after
a
couple
of
mouthfuls
finish
is
not
quite
so
clean
as
i
would
like
in
this
style
a
slight
hoppiness
here
a
more
bitter
finish
but
it
is
decent
would
be
a
good
mixin
with
some
of
the
more
classic
pils
fairly
crisp
although
the
finish
has
a
slight
resinlike
quality
still
smooth
with
a
good
body
and
a
nice
enough
taste
overall
its
a
pretty
darn
drinkable
brew
even
if
its
not
the
first
thing
i
reach
for
at
my
local
drinkability
its
okay
the
spiciness
and
heavy
body
make
this
very
uncharacterisitic
of
te
style
a
czeck
pils
should
be
very
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
i
have
been
brainwashed
into
believing
that
the
only
true
pils
comes
from
the
czech
republic
itself
where
their
water
lead
to
a
unique
and
suitable
product
having
said
that
this
interpretation
of
the
style
is
interesting
if
not
surprising
heavy
heavy
in
carbonation
and
bloatedness
mostly
saaz
hops
malt
aroma
enoz
saltz
composition
light
colour
with
some
cloudiness
pretty
clear
gold
hay
color
good
sized
head
able
to
form
but
doesnt
stay
too
long
some
lacing
left
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
just
light
malt
i
was
expecting
some
hops
to
be
showcased
but
nothing
really
the
taste
is
of
mainly
bready
cracker
type
malt
the
hops
are
very
subtle
sweet
slightly
tart
and
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
light
and
smooth
not
harshly
overcarbonated
like
ive
come
to
expect
from
some
lagers
or
pilsners
in
the
past
it
doesnt
pack
the
most
flavor
but
it
goes
down
really
well
d
this
is
admittedly
not
my
cup
of
tea
that
said
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
that
leans
towards
the
spicy
saaz
hop
side
of
the
fence
a
damn
good
brew
an
ok
beerim
sure
it
has
its
boosters
statesideim
probably
going
to
pass
on
purchasing
another
tastes
nice
and
crisp
upfront
a
slight
hop
kick
and
an
extremely
bitter
finish
very
understated
upfront
but
the
bitterness
at
the
end
makes
this
one
a
little
difficult
to
finish
needless
to
say
i
had
a
second
one
still
a
very
good
beer
with
a
kick
not
boring
at
all
bottle
this
was
a
surprise
for
me
i
am
not
sure
what
i
expected
but
the
beautiful
color
sort
of
a
gold
with
a
hint
of
orange
big
white
head
and
gentle
hop
and
malt
odors
get
you
off
to
a
good
start
easy
going
down
with
no
bad
tastes
at
any
point
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
good
pilsner
in
my
opinion
this
beer
aint
bad
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
im
glad
i
only
have
a
6
pack
of
it
and
not
a
full
case
i
would
recommend
it
but
i
wouldnt
have
it
any
time
soon
not
a
great
style
example
and
not
a
great
beer
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
not
the
up
and
down
malttohop
explosion
of
victorys
but
close
this
brew
poured
a
very
clear
straw
honey
color
with
a
medium
head
lacing
was
a
medium
to
minimal
while
carbonation
was
very
high
throughout
smell
is
very
weak
of
citrus
and
a
bit
of
banana
nothing
very
powerful
at
all
in
terms
of
odor
taste
is
very
bready
with
a
bit
of
lemon
and
butter
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
and
crisp
would
love
to
have
this
on
a
warm
summer
day
balance
is
a
bit
off
because
of
the
extreme
carbonation
but
drinkability
is
definitely
there
because
its
so
light
and
refreshing
for
sure
a
session
brew
drinkable
sure
forgettable
sure
not
too
bad
but
misses
too
much
of
what
i
look
for
in
a
pils
a
solidly
average
beer
not
the
most
amazing
of
beers
but
overall
its
still
a
good
beer
carbonation
is
minimal
a
little
heavier
in
mouth
feel
than
water
but
not
much
i
got
a
biscuity
taste
with
a
leaning
more
towards
the
sweet
malt
side
of
ripened
fruit
not
overpoweing
but
present
this
one
was
crisp
on
the
tongue
and
nevertheless
refreshing
d
nope
not
enough
of
that
pils
flavor
to
even
be
passable
in
my
book
a
tasty
brew
i
find
most
pilsner
to
be
rather
lifeless
however
this
one
is
full
flavored
with
an
interesting
character
excellent
bready
malt
and
floral
hops
flavors
are
balanced
and
unified
a
great
czech
pils
that
i
will
return
to
again
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
munich
malts
along
with
a
slight
hoppy
aroma
the
malt
aroma
is
a
bit
much
for
a
czech
pils
which
are
usually
a
bit
lighter
in
character
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
rich
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
but
not
as
easy
as
it
should
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
when
most
are
traditionally
low
bodied
and
a
bit
hoppier
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
but
its
a
bit
out
of
style
pours
a
bright
golden
orange
with
brilliant
clarity
fizzy
two
finger
head
settles
to
a
cap
of
rocky
foam
showing
good
retention
and
leaves
weak
spotty
lacing
the
malt
owns
the
aroma
of
pilsener
malt
and
dextrin
some
german
hop
tones
in
the
background
flash
of
sweet
lager
malt
followed
by
a
sharp
pilsener
mate
bite
and
finally
a
very
faint
toasted
nutbuiscuity
flavor
semidrying
aftertaste
the
spicy
and
floral
saaz
hop
is
in
effect
here
both
in
flavor
and
bitterness
it
balances
the
malt
but
falls
short
of
grabbing
your
attention
the
way
a
true
czechbohemian
pils
should
lightish
mouthfeel
with
highmedium
carbonation
seems
to
draw
some
depth
and
texture
from
the
full
malt
profile
finishes
clean
with
only
mild
residual
malt
and
fading
noble
hop
character
a
great
drinker
but
could
be
disapointing
if
you
were
looking
for
a
classic
pils
this
would
be
outstanding
if
the
hops
were
as
rich
as
the
malt
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
head
not
as
much
carbonation
i
would
expect
but
im
not
overly
familar
with
the
style
aroma
is
slightly
grainy
with
a
twinge
of
hops
kind
of
like
a
macro
lager
but
with
noticeable
hops
taste
is
a
nice
light
maltiness
followed
by
nicely
balenced
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
the
hops
are
slightly
citrusy
and
herbal
this
is
definitely
a
solid
drinkable
beer
great
for
a
party
or
to
introduce
to
nonbas
eric
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
pils
maybe
the
best
i
have
ever
had
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
crisp
pils
as
i
have
respect
for
lagunitas
and
while
this
beer
was
good
it
wasnt
nice
a
crisp
the
malt
profile
was
bland
sweetness
at
first
that
warmed
up
to
bready
pilsner
malt
there
was
also
just
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
sure
its
inoffensive
and
tastier
than
your
average
macro
pils
but
this
is
nothing
to
rejoice
over
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
very
small
creamy
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
nice
crisp
aroma
of
spicy
saaz
hops
light
pilsner
malt
and
a
touch
of
euro
yeast
palate
is
a
little
heavier
on
the
malt
than
most
pilsners
indicating
maybe
a
heavy
use
of
carapils
malt
assertive
spicy
hop
profile
smacks
of
saaz
and
other
noble
hops
body
is
somewhere
between
creamy
and
foamy
depending
on
how
careful
you
are
with
your
sipping
a
nice
easydrinking
pilsner
another
homerun
lagunitas
fairly
drinkable
but
id
probably
choose
something
else
drink
again
hell
no
i
look
to
pilsners
for
refreshment
but
this
was
so
far
from
hitting
the
mark
its
not
even
funny
not
bad
but
not
classic
not
a
must
have
but
not
one
to
turn
down
either
poured
a
golden
honey
color
with
a
one
finger
head
which
went
away
rather
quick
no
lacing
there
was
a
noticable
hop
and
light
malt
smell
the
hop
bite
hits
right
away
followed
by
a
sweet
malt
flavor
then
finishes
with
a
dry
hop
taste
that
lingers
this
pilsner
is
a
touch
maltier
than
others
that
i
have
tried
as
a
pilsner
it
has
initial
drinkability
but
the
bitter
dry
aftertaste
would
limit
me
to
only
a
couple
not
one
of
my
favorite
pils
drinkability
was
decent
because
the
beer
tastes
good
but
this
in
no
way
represents
anything
close
to
a
pilsner
the
one
drawback

and
its
hardly
the
brewers
fault

is
that
18
99
cdn
is
lot
to
pay
for
a
sixpack
otherwise
i
could
see
drinking
this
often
pours
a
sturdy
and
strong
head
with
great
retention
lots
of
fast
moving
amid
fast
bubbles
a
pretty
amber
color
for
a
czexh
pils
i
like
it
its
different
the
most
hoppy
smelling
czech
pils
ive
smelled
yet
i
like
still
leaves
room
for
the
grass
of
the
pils
the
taste
is
still
hoppy
but
mixed
very
well
with
the
crystal
malts
required
fro
a
true
pils
i
really
like
the
lack
of
skunk
like
flavors
a
great
cali
take
on
a
bohemian
classic
not
a
bad
u
s
pils
and
would
make
an
ideal
warm
weather
beer
maybe
drinking
it
will
make
me
forget
its
below
freezing
outside
nice
apple
juice
golden
in
colour
no
head
forms
a
little
musty
in
appearence
aroma
offers
a
fair
not
distasteful
but
certianly
far
from
favourable
malty
character
with
some
biscuity
dimension
body
is
dense
as
result
of
good
amount
of
malt
used
fairly
good
presence
carbonation
on
the
high
side
after
my
lager
tour
in
eastern
europe
through
poland
and
the
czech
republic
im
fairly
fine
with
saying
this
is
one
of
the
better
north
american
drafts
at
this
pilsner
style
tastefull
enough
lack
of
hops
but
with
a
small
snap
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
stays
clean
makes
for
good
drinking
fine
enough

with

seemed
pretty
heavily

from

i
picked
up

decent

leaning
on

lightly
sweet
and
grainy
a

in

but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
a
nice
quaffing
pils
pretty
basic
the
light
herbal
finish
makes
it
better
than
the
standard
lager
beer
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
premium
czech
style
by
any
means
overall
this
one
was
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
what
i
was
expecting
although
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
czech
pilsner
so
who
knows
anyway
besides
that
theres
not
much
that
stands
out
about
this
one
to
me
at
least
solid
but
nothing
spectacular
its
just
a
normal
pils
and
sometimes
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
pils
its
fairly
flavorful
and
fairly
enjoyable
but
its
nothing
special
while
it
has
a
couple
of
bright
spots
its
also
think
like
an
old
sock
too
thankfully
it
does
taste
better
than
an
old
sock
however
simply
the
sparseness
weighs
against
it
so
when
all
is
said
and
done
i
guess
id
have
to
say
its
fair
drinkability
see
previous
two
categories
if
youre
like
me
you
probably
became
disassociated
with
pilsners
when
you
discovered
the
quality
and
complexity
of
most
microbrewed
beers
me
too
problem
is
its
about
4500
degrees
in
the
shade
in
southern
california
right
now
and
the
hearty
ales
i
cling
to
during
the
fall
and
winter
months
just
aint
cuttin
it
hefeweizens
taste
great
but
are
too
filling
gaseous
if
you
feel
what
im
talking
about
here
than
i
think
this
beer
will
get
to
you
im
going
to
get
another
d
hell
yeah
very
drinkable
nice
flavors
all
around
overall
a
decent
drinkable
pils
glad
i
tried
it
but
there
are
many
better
versions
out
there
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
gold
color
with
a
large
white
head
a
nice
looking
hardy
beer
for
a
pilsner
the
smell
is
a
nice
mixture
of
floral
malt
and
bisquity
yeast
the
taste
is
a
little
thin
with
malt
and
floral
flavors
the
mf
is
light
with
the
malt
and
hop
bitterness
not
mixing
well
at
all
there
is
a
very
metalic
taste
to
this
beer
thats
not
pleasing
a
beer
that
started
out
well
finishes
poorly
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
d
very
tasty
with
a
gorgeous
mouthfeel
highly
enjoyable
ill
be
looking
forward
to
this
again
pours
a
dark
gold
hazey
and
inviting
leaving
a
spotchy
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
but
one
swirl
quickly
brings
it
back
the
aroma
is
fruity
hop
spiciness
that
is
very
clean
and
brisk
the
taste
starts
crisp
with
a
hop
bitter
twang
that
finishes
with
a
honey
malt
backbone
for
balance
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
i
will
def
visit
this
offering
again
overall
impression
nicely
balanced
very
drinkable
i
wish
more
american
brewers
put
out
pilsners
of
this
caliber
this
is
a
great
transitional
beer
for
budmiller
drinkers
ive
got
people
who
dont
even
like
beer
drinking
this
stuff
d
this
beer
is
mostly
about
the
big
bitter
flavor
with
little
depth
in
the
hops
and
not
much
malt
flavor
to
balance
it
out
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
very
nice
pilsner
another
good
beer
from
lagunitas
its
golden
it
smells
like
a
very
tasty
pilsner
not
a
regular
pilsner
it
tastes
like
a
very
hoppy
malty
pilsner
which
isnt
really
what
a
pilsner
shoots
for
but
its
pretty
decent
it
feels
great
in
the
mouth
and
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
to
imbibe
overall
this
is
a
pilsner
worth
a
try
but
isnt
really
all
that
special
compared
to
some
others
out
there
overall
a
good
pils
and
a
decent
beer
drink
up
this
is
one
of
a
few
nonmacro
pilsners
ive
had
and
i
now
im
really
starting
to
see
what
its
supposed
to
be
tasting
notes
breaddy
and
biscuitty
nice
malt
upfront
very
pleasant
hop
finish
pleasantly
carbonated
good
mouthfeelthis
is
an
excellent
pilsner
very
very
drinkable
this
one
goes
as
nice
as
snpa
for
drinking
all
day
long
clear
gold
with
a
bronze
hue
topped
by
a
fluffy
white
head
decent
retention
a
bit
of
lacing
crackery
fresh
grain
aroma
with
spicy
saaz
and
a
bit
of
fruity
hops
medium
bodied
malty
flavour
with
moderate
bitterness
and
quite
a
lot
of
spicy
hop
character
light
dryness
with
a
bit
of
spicy
tingle
in
the
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
good
about
what
i
expect
from
lagunitas
its
got
a
nice
hop
depth
to
it
as
well
d
good
hot
day
drinker
if
you
dont
mind
the
over
the
top
hops
enjoyable
but
there
are
many
other
domestic
pilsners
that
i
prefer
over
the
lagunitas
pilsner
the
bright
yellow
body
pours
crystal
clear
with
an
explosive
head
that
mellows
to
somewhat
more
than
a
rim
after
a
couple
minutes
smells
crisp
and
floral
with
hints
of
lemon
and
a
slight
metallic
tinge
the
taste
is
solidly
malty
crisp
yet
full
and
the
saaz
hoppage
is
right
on
the
money
slight
floral
taste
with
a
clean
stiff
bitterness
to
round
out
the
sip
theres
something
about
the
malt
character
though
thats
just
a
touch
off
a
bit
of
toasty
new
belgium
character
that
i
wouldnt
expect
in
a
pils
still
thats
very
slight
and
aside
from
that
this
is
a
great
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
beer
has
ample

the
beer
is

to

good
beeri
would
try
again
pours
a

lots
of

bubbles
no

nose
is
a
nice
simple
bready

with
some
slight

taste
starts
out
with
a
fruity
maltmainly
apple
and
then
rather
abrubtly
ends
with
a
strong
grassy
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
moderatehigh
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
pils
but
nothing
special
golden
yellow
effervescent
creamy
one
finger
head
smells
alive
and
hoppy
resinous
taste
is
maltier
than
expected
husky
but
dead
ends
quickly
into
a
rather
herbal
hop
flavor
with
a
sourish
odd
and
longlasting
aftertaste
the
more
i
drank
the
less
i
wanted
to
the
aftertaste
was
hard
to
get
rid
of
and
haunted
me
for
a
few
hours
afterward
i
tend
to
like
a
good
pilsener
but
this
didnt
do
it
for
me
to
say
the
least
this
darkish
yellow
pilsner
pour
with
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
is
redolent
of
grasses
and
wildflowers
the
taste
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
some
sweet
malt
notes
coming
out
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
saaz
bitterness
on
the
back
overall
the
taste
was
clean
but
not
terribly
interesting
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilsners
but
ive
had
a
few
that
manage
to
be
true
to
the
style
clean
and
refreshing
but
also
interesting
sadly
this
beer
isnt
in
that
mold
outside
of
a
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
theres
not
a
heck
of
a
lot
to
recommend
this
theres
nothing
at
all
to
not
recommend
it
either
its
a
fine
beer
just
not
terribly
interesting
hazy
dark
orange
i
might
have
let
some
of
the
sediment
make
it
through
with
a
medium
head
ultimately
leaving
a
ring
and
some
broken
islands
of
bubbles
smell
is
bready
malt
bakery
sweet
but
no
hop
presence
mild
clean
malt
hit
at
the
beginning
turning
soon
to
a
crispy
bitterness
a
little
rough
in
the
finish
but
nothing
overpowering
light
bodied
but
not
crispy
enough
to
be
memorable
easy
to
drink
nothing
to
refuse
try
it
if
you
like
the
style
a
bold
beer
if
you
like
in
your
face
brews
this
will
be
a
nice
choice
if
your
looking
for
a
pilsner
that
is
floral
flavorful
but
delicate
seek
out
pilsner
urquell
or
brooklyns
pilsner
a
really
nice
pilsner
and
another
great
introductory
brew
i
would
personally
serve
it
at
ten
or
so
degrees
above
fridge
temp
where
the
flavors
seem
to
be
more
subtle
which
ups
the
drinkability
pretty
darn
high
a
nice
drinkable
lager
but
not
quite
the
light
refreshing
pils
id
hoped
for
extremely
drinkable
beer
tasty
and
mild
mannered
with
a
go
shot
of
hop
bitterness
recommended
overall
an
above
average
pils
not
my
favorite
style
its
much
more
bitter
than
id
expect
i
picked
up
hoppysaaz
even
slightly
floral
right
off
the
bat
malts
were
subdued
and
more
of
a
filler
light
fruitiness
mostly
orange
perfect
carbonation
tasted
the
yeast
ive
come
to
expect
in
this
style
but
this
was
lighter
in
that
department
and
more
of
a
hopped
up
spicyness
that
was
enjoyable
and
easy
on
the
palate
crisp
mouthfeel
that
finishes
moderately
dry
not
the
thirst
quencher
nor
the
session
beer
that
one
might
expect
this
has
some
characteristics
that
make
it
more
compatible
with
a
meal
than
a
session
a
very
respectable
offering
from
lagunitas
beer
is
good
happy
beering
ive
really
been
digging
this
style
recently
ive
definately
come
to
appreciate
the
refreshing
crispness
of
a
nice
zesty
pilsner
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
pours
a
clear
and
bubbly
blonde
with
some
straw
coloring
and
a
pinky
of
white
head
floating
atop
smells
of
nice
mellow
czech
malts
and
a
dusty
hop
smell
taste
is
more
pronounced
than
in
the
smell
and
does
not
let
you
down
i
love
the
way
pilsners
are
hopped
spicy
dusty
floral
herbal
just
downright
zesty
this
one
also
had
a
nice
pine
characteristic
which
i
think
must
be
a
west
coast
twist
on
the
style
very
interesting
but
not
overdone
very
subtle
lightly
sweet
grainy
malts
back
up
the
hops
perfectly
excellent
balance
smooth
crisp
mouthfeel
again
excellent
and
i
find
pilsners
to
be
super
drinkable
especially
in
hot
weather
so
drink
em
while
you
can
by
the
way
i
reviewed
this
beer
as
a
particular
style
it
seems
that
pilsners
tend
to
get
rated
lower
due
to
their
lack
of
complexity
or
their
closeness
in
relation
to
macros
even
in
the
world
of
pilsners
czech
style
is
a
bit
different
from
everything
else
out
there
crisp
perhaps
thats
the
best
way
to
describe
this
pils
nice
gold
color
suitably
carbonated
but
it
produces
a
poor
head
excellent
grainy
malt
flavor
but
balanced
very
well
for
an
american
pilsner
kudos
for
laguntas
for
making
a
solid
pils
in
california
taste
was
malty
and
hoppy
again
a
bit
bitter
tastier
than
expected
after
the
smell
a
little
bit
of
breadyness
in
there
and
orange
which
sort
of
fits
and
sort
of
doesnt
good
but
not
extraordinary
mouthfeel
is
okay
and
pretty
darned
drinkable
light
refreshing
goes
down
easy
ill
have
to
try
this
guy
again
in
the
bottle
see
what
its
like
there
remind
me
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
this
pils
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
persisted
a
while
and
left
some
lace
there
was
a
good
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
bready
malty
with
light
noble
hops
the
taste
was
bready
malty
with
moderate
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
this
was
a
decent
pils
but
on
the
mild
side
put
this
up
there
near
dortmunder
gold
as
one
of
the
best
lagers
kicked
out
by
craft
brewers
poured
a
hazed
light
gold
with
a
puffy
white
cap
delicate
aroma
gainy
light
sweetness
but
without
the
floral
skunk
of
the
cz
pilsens
wow
pepperybittering
blast
with
subtantial
malts
and
tangy
citrus
hops
malty
bitter
but
not
what
i
would
call
dry
nice
twist
on
the
style
this
is
a
pilsner
for
ale
heads
that
live
for
hop
alpha
oils
actually
it
has
more
ale
traits
than
pilsner
but
who
cares
it
works
golden
color
clouded
with
chill
haze
thin
white
head
that
is
maintained
by
the
vigorous
carbonation
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
for
the
full
beer
smell
is
grassy
with
mild
citrus
note
the
most
noticable
tastes
were
the
malt
sweetness
up
front
and
the
hops
bitterness
on
the
backend
light
body
and
smooth
finish
an
easy
drinking
summer
brew
nothing
stands
out
but
no
noticable
flaws
either
this
one
pours
out
pretty
increduously
making
that
fizzy
pouring
sound
you
always
hear
in
the
commercials
a
nice
fluffy
head
forms
atop
the
golden
straw
colored
body
the
smell
is
clean
with
a
touch
of
grain
and
a
buttery
character
good
crisp
aroma
taste
starts
sweet
with
that
grain
taste
that
was
noted
in
the
nose
a
bit
of
hops
kicks
in
imparting
a
spiciness
to
this
one
that
is
reminiscent
of
thyme
or
oregano
buttery
flavor
underlies
all
this
giving
it
a
sweetness
that
is
pleasurable
but
seems
out
of
place
but
ive
read
its
not
uncommon
the
carbonation
is
pretty
low
after
the
initial
pour
light
bodied
and
smooth
very
clean
and
refreshing
this
is
a
good
full
bodied
pils
that
is
crisp
clean
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
one
thing
it
lacks
is
the
real
saaz
hops
off
the
nose
i
must
say
that
i
prefer
their
ales
but
after
tasting
so
many
lagers
locally
that
are
only
a
better
alternative
to
a
macro
lager
the
fact
that
this
beer
has
taste
is
appreciated
pours
a
rich
gold
color
that
is
brilliantly
clear
a
cascade
of
carbonation
bubbles
rises
up
through
this
beer
and
holds
aloft
a
frothy
rocky
head
that
is
initially
four
fingers
thick
as
i
pour
this
beer
i
get
a
hint
of
aromatic
lemon
herb
scents
as
i
go
in
for
a
deeper
sniff
i
get
notes
of
grass
a
bit
of
hay
and
sweet
grain
as
well
as
the
afore
mentioned
lemon
and
herbal
notes
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
and
fairly
spritzy
throughout
from
the
ample
carbonation
the
hops
play
a
strong
role
here
they
bring
a
spicy
herbal
note
that
blends
in
a
hint
of
lemon
pepper
a
dash
of
hay
and
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
pils
it
is
refreshing
and
simple
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
here
that
keeps
this
beer
from
being
dry
that
balances
well
with
the
hops
drinkability
ehhh
ive
had
better
pils
along
the
way
no
need
to
try
this
one
again
this
pils
poured
a
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
lovely
beady
peachtinted
head
i
found
the
nose
quite
invigorating
a
smell
of
fresh
malt
immediately
i
notice
a
very
good
balance
in
the
mouthfeel
and
it
is
certainly
juicy
there
are
some
corn
flavors
there
but
they
are
subtle
mostly
the
purposeful
floral
accent
serves
as
a
welcome
dulling
effect
the
finish
keeps
balanced
and
quenching
it
leaves
a
little
bit
of
a
peachy
and
a
kind
of
light
rosey
essence
really
wonderful
this
is
a
great
social
brew
and
very
well
done
for
the
style
cheers
pours
a
white
two
fingerhead
that
goes
slowly
leaving
a
decent
lace
clear
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
slightly
hoppy
starts
with
more
malts
than
hops
but
sweetness
fades
to
a
slight
bitter
finish

60
for
a
12oz
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
edit
3
days
later
try
again
and
its
tastes
really
good
i
dunno
this
is
more
of
a
drink
at
a
bbq
out
of
the
bottle
than
think
about
too
hard
type
of
beer
also
im
pretty
sure
these
are
skunked
bottles
finally
a
pils
that
i
like
this
gem
poured
a
little
darker
than
most
pils
with
a
very
faint
orange
tint
to
it
the
head
was
nice
and
frothy
and
settled
into
a
nice
pillow
of
foam
for
the
rest
of
the
session
the
smell
is
actually
pretty
malty
sweet
with
a
hint
of
carmel
malt
and
light
grassy
undertones
the
taste
blew
me
away
it
had
a
nice
dry
saaz
and
citrus
bite
in
the
beginning
along
with
a
nice
malt
sweetnes
in
the
bakground
that
lends
a
little
bit
of
thickness
to
the
body
and
a
nice
flavorful
finnish
that
left
me
wanting
another
drink
this
is
the
session
pils
for
me
a
must
try
not
my
choice
for
a
pils
lagunitas
pils
is
a
strange
one
it
drinks
like
a
cross
between
an
amber
and
a
pils
with
some
offputting
diacetyl
thrown
in
for
bad
measure
this
beer
isnt
horrible
but
it
needs
a
complete
overhaul
read
recipe
change
before
ill
give
it
another
chance
had
three
of
these
the
other
night
at
bones
i
thought
it
was
very
good
especially
for
an
american
take
on
the
style
pour
when
served
was
the
color
of
golden
yellow
sunshine
i
enjoyed
the
snow
white
head
on
top
it
left
many
many
rings
in
my
glass
as
i
drank
it
down
the
low
aroma
was
a
bit
appleycitrusy
clean
crisp
initially
it
had
some
grainyness
in
the
finish
but
only
a
touch
very
smooth
great
session
beer
a
fine
pilsner
is
the
palette
cleanser
of
the
beer
world
you
can
drink
one
after
almost
any
other
beer
and
uncover
all
of
the
subtleties
it
has
to
offer
and
move
on
to
the
next
style
to
do
the
same
the
lagunitas
offering
pours
a
bright
gold
clear
with
a
thick
white
head
refilled
by
champagne
bubbles
the
nose
is
a
crisp
hop
citrus
backed
by
a
mild
caramel
from
the
malt
the
taste
is
a
refreshing
hop
citrus
hints
of
grapefruit
accented
nicely
by
subtle
hop
flower
there
is
just
a
hint
of
malt
on
the
finish
smooth
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
most
likely
the
lightest
beer
ive
had
from
lagunitas
still
decent
never
the
less
had
a
very
thin
head
on
the
pour
with
a
lot
of
small
carbonation
bubbles
very
easy
to
drink
something
you
might
suggest
to
a
not
so
experimental
beer
drinker
the
cez
style
gave
it
an
easy
to
drink
golden
flavor
there
are
hints
of
wheat
with
an
over
all
refreshing
taste
to
it
not
a
beer
a
would
drink
at
warmer
temperatures
keep
this
one
cold
i
think
the
pilsner
category
limits
the
things
they
could
have
done
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
still
a
good
lightly
hand
crafted
beer
clear
and
honey
golden
with
tons
of
carbination
seen
rising
up
to
the
thick
cap
of
heavy
eggshell
foam
the
rich
milkshakey
head
left
a
ton
of
lacing
but
reduced
down
to
a
good
capping
very
nice
aroma
with
surprising
strength
to
it
can
catch
it
from
a
few
feet
away
very
malty
and
sweet
nicely
pronounced
flavors
good
bite
of
peppery
hops
and
caramelly
malts
good
bitterness
left
in
your
mouth
crisp
and
sharp
flavors
the
carbination
feels
good
it
is
just
enough
i
thought
it
would
be
too
much
from
all
i
could
see
going
on
but
it
was
just
right
very
drinkable
pils
great
session
with
good
flavors
and
feel
to
it
bottle
tinny
rusty
flavour
bit
of
saaz
and
grainy
malts
not
much
else
though
short
finish
i
really
wasnt
a
fan
of
lagunitas
perhaps
their
beers
are
better
on
tap
i
dont
know
but
all
the
bottled
version
i
had
while
in
the
us
were
a
little
underwhelming
dissapointing
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
creamy
texture
if
anything
it
might
of
been
too
creamy
i
would
of
liked
to
see
the
hops
really
stand
out
in
this
brew
but
just
didnt
come
through
decent
but
not
worthy
of
being
in
regular
rotation
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
pilsners
ive
ever
had
stacked
like
a
brick
house
but
dressed
stylishly
all
the
same
no
tube
top
or
hot
pants
necessary
to
sell
this
uptown
girl
a
well
bred
lager
actually
worth
the
hefty
import
price
tag
i
shelled
out
for
ill
be
back
for
more
and
will
bring
flowers
and
chocolates
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
white
head
over
the
clear
golden
brew
foamy
head
lasts
and
exhibits
very
nice
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
of
pale
malts
and
crisp
hops
taste
is
upfront
sweet
pale
malt
which
then
switches
abruptly
to
a
nice
hops
flavor
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
excellent
wonderful
example
of
the
style
suprised
to
find
this
uncommon
one
on
tap
at
a
bbq
spot
in
nyc
blue
smoke
poured
cloudy
medium
straw
in
color
white
12
inch
tiny
bubble
head
and
displaying
well
developed
fine
lacing
nose
of
powdered
sugar
and
bread
this
is
light
to
medium
bodied
hoppy
crisp
and
refreshing
pilsner
palate
cleansing
lager
which
went
well
with
the
bbq
not
much
of
a
finish
sort
of
petered
out
to
wateryness
servicable
sessioner
a
bit
on
the
sweetish
side
for
my
taste
in
pilsner
beer
id
prefer
something
a
bit
hoppier
but
the
softness
of
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
a
czech
version
im
guessing
this
is
hopped
with
something
besides
saaz
because
im
picking
up
some
strong
floral
notes
perhaps
a
bit
of
citrus
perhaps
one
of
the
north
american
saaz
crosses
who
knows
either
way
its
nice
stuff
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
sometime
i
imagine
it
would
be
a
good
session
mildly
crisp
mouthfeel
at
the
start
and
finish
where
other
pils
are
more
crisp
than
this
this
was
also
a
little
heavier
in
body
than
other
pils
overall
a
slightly
above
average
brew
not
sure
if
ive
ever
had
a
nonmacro
pils
but
i
do
remember
not
liking
macro
pils
but
this
is
pretty
good
and
may
alter
my
thoughts
on
pils
the
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
tawny
yellow
in
color
with
mild
carbonation
a
head
formed
on
top
about
to
fingerwidths
deep
that
quickly
dissipated
after
each
sip
a
thin
lace
would
form
but
the
disappear
before
the
next
sip
the
aroma
is
bitter
which
comes
thorugh
with
a
nice
bitter
and
sour
hoppy
flavor
there
was
not
much
else
with
the
beers
flavor
really
it
would
make
a
great
thirst
quenching
drink
the
only
negative
was
that
the
hops
were
pungent
enough
that
when
i
burped
i
was
kind
of
taken
back
by
own
breath
this
poured
out
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
about
a
halfinch
of
white
foam
head
floating
on
top
some
lace
was
left
around
the
glass
as
this
was
consumed
aroma
was
mainly
just
biscuity
malts
taste
was
crisp
with
bready
type
malts
and
a
slight
sweetness
very
mild
beer
all
around
body
was
about
medium
and
well
carbonated
decent
brew
overall
but
nothing
special
the
taste
was
much
like
the
smell
sweet
with
a
very
clean
taste
crisp
in
the
end
with
a
bite
of
bitterness
very
impressed
for
a
pils
very
well
crafted
example
of
a
german
pilsener
by
a
good
california
brewery
nice
balance
and
enjoyable
drinkability
this
is
a
fine
pilsner
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
orangish
hue
head
is
very
impressive
coats
of
lacing
cover
the
glass
the
smell
is
strong
of
thick
malts
slight
grain
detected
a
refreshing
cascade
pine
hops
detected
as
well
so
unlike
the
pilsners
that
most
are
used
to
this
one
uses
a
great
blend
of
hops
that
really
stand
out
the
smooth
crisp
sweet
caramel
malt
is
impressive
hints
of
grain
medium
bodied
and
very
good
a
great
beer
for
sessions
or
those
football
games
12
ounce
bottle
a
tasty
beverage
but
the
corn
aroma
detracts
this
is
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
at
5
5
alcohol
i
emailed
the
company
and
asked
they
said
they
didnt
like
advertising
the
abv
because
they
dont
want
it
to
be
seen
as
a
strength
claim
whatever
that
means
the
smell
is
a
bit
hoppy
which
isnt
bad
for
a
change
the
taste
is
of
the
same
but
a
little
acidic
as
well
it
doesnt
sit
very
well
on
my
tongue
but
its
still
reasonably
drinkable
clear
golden
orange
medium
offwhite
head
a
bit
dirty
looking
and
weakly
carbonated
for
a
pilsener
stong
wheatiness
to
the
nose
with
some
brad
notes
and
floral
hints
flavor
starts
a
bit
acidic
and
becomes
very
dry
in
the
aftertaste
wheat
takes
a
step
back
in
the
flavor
allowing
the
hoppiness
to
come
right
out
bold
hops
but
overall
thin
taste
and
not
very
traditional
for
a
pilsener
i
know
lagunitas
likes
to
go
off
the
beaten
path
but
this
time
i
think
they
just
went
askew
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
tasty
pilsner
that
went
down
fine
it
just
didnt
quite
hit
the
mark
in
terms
of
the
style
its
taste
profile
seemed
to
be
leaning
too
much
in
favor
of
malty
sweetness
sacrificing
the
hoppy
notes
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
it
also
wasnt
as
dry
and
crisp
as
most
other
pilsners
ive
sampled
while
its
a
good
beer
im
not
sure
it
fits
the
style
appears
a
glowing
orange
golden
hue
with
a
magnificant
sized
white
head
leaving
very
fine
lace
behind
great
looking
brew
aromatics
are
malty
with
some
saaz
backing
the
nice
malt
characater
up
some
grassy
notes
very
nice
with
some
bready
yeast
tones
hanging
around
as
well
from
the
bottle
conditioning
taste
upfront
bready
with
a
great
finishing
zesty
peppery
hops
but
a
smooth
vanilla
like
malt
character
ties
everything
together
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
decent
carbonation
and
one
very
drinkable
beer
to
boot
tasty
and
refreshing
a
winning
combonation
every
time
light

color
medium
foamy

is

and
a
little
hoppy
a
fullbodied
pilsner
malty
and
somewhat
hoppy
touch
of
sweetness
at
the
start
that
gives
way
to
a
fairly
strong

comments
rather
enjoyed
this
and
would
happily
have
it
again
lagunitas
may
be
coming
in
to
its
own
i
do
not
regularily
drink
pilsners
but
this
one
is
very
good
if
only
the
macros
could
understand
this
beer
we
would
not
bash
them
so
much
i
will
definately
try
more
of
thier
beers
soon
again
far
too
thick
and
sweet
nice
try
but
you
missed
a
most
wonderful
beer
to
drink
best
from
this
brewery
i
have
tasted
unsusal
for
a
west
coast
brewer
to
do
great
lager
poured
from
a
short
12
ounce
bottle
it
a
crystal
clear
yellowish
gold
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
the
head
dimishes
but
leaves
a
thin
layer
on
top
of
the
glass
all
the
way
down
the
saaz
hops
are
immediately
noticeable
along
with
slight
grainy
aroma
the
taste
is
nice
with
a
bit
of
hop
bite
and
grassy
flavors
mixing
well
the
mouthfeel
is
what
id
expect
in
a
pilsener
as
for
drinkability
its
100
damn
degrees
today
and
this
stuff
goes
down
like
water
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
lure
macro
drinkers
to
something
better
nose
is
sweet
and
corny
with
a
large
blazing
hop
aroma
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
honey
malty
with
a
hop
bitterness
accentuated
by
a
mineral
character
to
the
water
slighly
hazy
dark
gold
color
a
shade
up
from
many
fairly
big
head
but
flat
on
top
and
greatly
diminished
at
40
seconds
simple
but
complete
laces
hoppy
aroma
unmistakable
saaz
qualities
the
body
was
quite
a
bit
bigger
than
i
expected
with
a
fleshy
melon
and
caramel
malt
start
and
mid
mouth
impression
hops
bitter
well
and
this
brew
is
solidly
balanced
though
it
swaps
personalities
and
ends
with
some
pine
even
in
the
aftertaste
not
a
very
light
and
crisp
example
of
a
pils
more
guts
than
style
points
on
this
one
a
very
nice
pilsener
this
is
a
very
crisp
clean
tasting
brew
with
a
nicely
balanced
level
of
hops
the
presentation
is
whats
expected
from
a
regional
with
clever
naming
and
descriptions
of
the
bottle
contents
poured
a
very
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
had
good
retention
this
is
a
robust
czech
style
with
the
emphasis
on
body
rather
than
heavy
hopping
a
very
enjoyable
beer
all
round
from
hollingshead
deli
in
orange
ca
i
just
cant
get
into
these
bohemianczech
pilseners
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
color
with
a
medium
white
head
thin
lacing
and
the
head
disappeared
rather
quickly
aroma
is
mostly
hops
with
a
tiny
bit
of
fruit
flavor
is
mildly
hoppy
with
a
little
malt
backbone
and
a
somewhat
sour
finish
also
has
a
very
carbonated
feel
but
manages
to
not
be
very
crisp
at
the
same
time
this
pours
a
bright
golden
like
youd
expect
a
pilsner
with
a
nice
amount
of
head
and
decent
retension
the
smell
is
definately
pilsner
with
a
hint
of
skunk
you
know
the
saaz
through
light
glass
smell
the
malt
profile
is
sweet
and
subtle
ill
have
to
remember
this
come
summertime
pretty
decent
brew
from
lagunitas
poured
a
medium
straw
head
retention
was
decent
and
lacing
was
above
average
malty
smell
highlighted
by
saaz
hops
good
smooth
taste
with
decent
hop
bite
i
really
like
the
flavor
of
the
saaz
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
could
become
a
warm
weather
staple
highly
chill
hazed
golden
orange
in
appearance
a
clingy
offwhite
head
that
barely
skims
the
surface
but
laces
effectively
fresh
hop
leaf
aroma
floral
and
spicy
in
nature
almost
full
body
not
quite
spicy
and
bitter
taste
doesnt
taste
like
a
good
pilsner
or
dortmuder
to
me
theres
actually
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
tannin
like
and
not
pleasant
this
is
a
below
average
beer
along
with
their
imperial
stout
the
only
subpar

ive
had
from

big

definitely
not
a
subtle
pilsner

overall
a
a
fairly
interesting
pilsner
overall
i
am
not
terribly
impressed
with
this
pils
it
tastes
like
a
pils
kind
of
what
i
would
describe
as
table
beer
something
you
can
drink
with
meals
and
in
volume
but
i
have
had
better
pils
this
one
was
a
bit
flat
super
drinkable
super
clean
awesome
for
a
9
six
pack
i
love
that
its
unfiltered
and
it
tastes
that
way
in
a
good
way
notch
pilsner
very
effectively
provides
a
clean
crisp
extremely
flavorful
satisfying
pilsner
with
only
4abv
nothing
against
the
wonderful
varieties
of
heavier
microbrews
out
there
however
notch
should
be
praised
for
their
tasty
refreshing
products
contributions
to
the
american
beer
scene
not
the
absolute
best
example
of
the
style
but
not
at
all
a
bad
beer
yikes
i
love
this
beer
overall
well
they
got
the
mouthfeel
right
but
i
am
afraid
the
unusual
malt
and
hop
flavors
here
make
this
beer
rather
hard
to
enjoy
this
is
light
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
i
recommend
this
one
for
people
who
like
balanced
and
drinkable
hop
flavor
i
would
prefer
this
to
a
light
ipa
for
example
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
pilsner
exactly
what
i
wanted
with
lunch
outside
on
a
nice
day
easy
to
drink
and
some
nice
floral
and
citrus
notes
in
the
taste
would
have
it
again
o
i
dont
see
myself
having
this
one
again
but
elements
of
this
brew
encourage
me
to
try
other
offerings
from
notch
o
this
beer
was
refreshing
paired
great
with
food
and
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
think
i
could
have
literally
drank
this
beer
all
day
long
though
i
am
guessing
that
is
the
point
of
creating
these
session
style
beers
from
notch
eh
the
taste
tends
to
downplay
the
sweet
malts
and
biscuit
in
favor
of
a
notable
clean
and
crisp
hop
feel
coming
up
the
backside
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
tip
of
the
hat
to
the
guys
in
ipswich
thank
you
o
goes
down
very
easy
rather
tasty
not
filling
no
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
great
beer
that
falls
more
under
the
true
definition
of
a
session
beer
it
will
definitely
be
a
staple
come
summer
time
o
went
in
with
low
expectations
but
found
myself
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
would
probably
purchase
again
when
looking
for
a
low
abv
sessioner
stuff
goes
down
really
easy
based
on
the
reviews
it
has
id
say
this
one
is
a
bit
underrated
imo
the
beer
pours
like
crisp
watery
gold
and
sits
in
the
mug
like
light
grapefruit
juice
and
piss
with
a
slight
ambering
this
beer
is
only
slightly
hazy
and
opaque
due
to
it
being
unfiltered
and
has
a
great
torrent
of
bubbles
rushing
to
the
surface
to
replenish
the
head
which
is
a
pure
white
eggshell
made
of
nice
little
smooth
bubbles
that
settle
at
about
a
fingers
width
and
seem
like
their
staying
for
a
drink
the
beer
smells
wet
and
spicy
with
a
juicy
linger
of
the
almostapple
that
ive
come
to
associate
with
pilsners
the
hops
are
nicely
spicy
though
with
hints
of
fluffy
buttered
biscuit
pulling
through
in
the
back
and
edges
of
the
glass
the
beer
tastes
much
like
any
other
pilsner
there
is
the
slightlystalebread
taste
of
the
malts
that
runs
strongly
through
the
sip
and
lingers
in
the
mouth
for
awhile
and
there
are
nice
slight
spices
from
the
hops
and
fruity
juicy
feel
reminiscent
of
apples
as
the
beer
initially
crosses
the
tip
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
quite
tart
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
assaulting
the
tongue
and
leaving
it
tingling
with
a
slight
sheen
of
saliva
and
dry
bread
feel
in
the
rest
of
the
mouth
the
beer
is
very
crisp
and
watery
making
it
very
drinkable
and
it
does
not
sit
heavy
in
the
stomach
but
i
suspect
that
the
pilsner
style
is
just
not
my
favorite
as
i
am
just
not
impressed
with
this
beer
overall
i
call
this
beer
a
meh
o
overall
an
average
pilsner
just
a
bit
more
bitter
than
the
norm
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
since
it
seems
a
bit
on
the
sweet
and
citrusy
but
this
still
a
good
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
while
pours
a
five
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
some
lace
almost
clear
pale
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
light
bodied
light
grassy
nose
and
flavor
is
hoppy
grassy
with
a
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste

flavors
are

toasty

and
a
slightly
sour

with

to
clean
it
all
up
nicely

the

is
quick
and
clean
leaving
the
palate
with
only
a
touch
of
the
tangy

a
clear
miss
on
this
batch
perhaps
ill
try
this
again
and
see
if
i
happened
upon
a
mistake
this
time
o
with
work
this
could
be
excellent
i
wish
we
had
easydrinking
session
ales
like
this
in
ca
o
good
flavors
and
low
abv
make
this
a
good
candidate
for
an
every
night
pilsener
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
it
was
interesting
drinking
a
4
beer
that
had
this
much
flavor
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
with
no
alcohol
detectable
there
is
a
smooth
but
light
feel
that
makes
this
beer
go
down
quicker
then
it
seams
at
first
a
really
good
session
beer
its
not
bad
but
not
something
i
could
drink
all
day
either
which
was
the
intent
so
it
misses
its
mark
though
its
a
decent
beer
it
misses
its
intent
solid
light
pils
nice
hops
but
i
would
like
it
to
be
a
bit
more
hoppy
instead
of
grainy
overall
i
was
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
the
low
abv
is
icing
on
the
cake
its
not
quite
as
clean
as
the
worldclass
pilsners
but
its
still
well
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
summer
beer
but
i
could
never
see
myself
picking
up
a
sixer
given
the
number
of
better
beers
at
this
abv
and
price
point
a
fine
if
unremarkable
pils
aiming
for
the
old
world
rustic
version
of
the
czech
lager
mild
haze
but
golden
color
still
shines
bright
in
the
light
enough
froth
for
a
pils
to
be
proud
of
freshcut
crabgrass
wild
herbal
hop
and
a

of

some
fine

would
do
this

great
hard
pressed
to
put
back
more
than
one
odjust
bland
i
can
see
why
they
named
it
session
pils
but
id
prefer
both
my
session
beer
and
my
pilsener
to
have
a
bit
more
personality
not
clean
enough
of
a
beer
for
the
style
i
will
pass
on
this
the
next
time
i
see
it
overall
pretty
good
the
nose
is
a
bit
too
light
but
taste
is
good
for
a
4
very
sessionable
light
summer
clean
and
crisp
beer
overall
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
clean
crisp
well
balanced
and
extremely
quaffable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
would
probably
buy
this
regularly
if
i
had
access
drinkability
is
high
of
course
because
of
the
abv
but
the
taste
plays
into
the
drinkability
well
too
just
because
a
beer
sports
a
low
abv
doesnt
mean
its
tasty
enough
to
warrant
a
few
this
satisfies
both
needs
and
is
worth
picking
up
again
for
the
right
occasion
though
there
are
better
pilsners
especially
if
you
prefer
yours
with
some
snappy
crispness
overall
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
the
flavors
just
did
not
come
together
for
me
there
is
an
odd
sweetness
that
i
associate
with
leinenkugels
while
it
works
there
in
some
instances
the
sweetness
here
is
a
bit
out
of
place
i
want
to
drink
this
and
with
some
small
modifications
i
could
see
this
being
a
regular
beer
in
my
rotation
but
for
now
a
pass
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
tasty
beer
well
balanced
and
with
the
lower
abv
you
can
enjoy
several
at
one
sitting
always
on
the
lookout
for
tasty
fullbodied
lowabv
beer
i
recently
dragged
home
a
bottle
of
notchs
session
ale
and
this
bottle
of
their
pils
after
trying
the
ale
and
being
totally
underwhelmed
by
it
i
was
prepared
for
more
of
same
from
the
pils
but
was
happily
surprised
this
was
not
the
hopheavy
swipe
that
i
expected
but
instead
was
quite
tasty
and
balanced
the
aroma
is
a
bit
light
but
it
still
emitted
a
good
handful
of
flowers
and
a
lemon
peel
or
two
light
and
flavorful
this
is
definitely
a
beer
for
the
summer
im
not
one
to
drink
beer
and
then
operate
machinery
of
any
kind
especially
the
kind
with
whirring
blades
but
if
i
had
to
choose
a
lawnmower
beer
this
would
rate
at
the
top
of
the
safety
list
overall
a
good
beer
will
buy
again
pretty
clean
for
a
contract
brew
shouldnt
be
surprised
because
ipswich
makes
good
beer
lagers
are
usually
more
mundane
than
this
one
like
the
mild
bitterness
at
the
finish
sweet
with
a
berry
like
presence
again
pretty
low
hop
which
leads
to
a
shorter
aftertaste
the
body
is
quite
good
although
the
carbonation
is
elevated
id
say
this
falls
short
of
the
czech
pils
goal
this
is
one
of
the
first
breweries
i
tried
in
the
atlanta
area
so
im
particularly
loyal
to
this
place
that
being
said
long
day
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
def
better
on
tap
but
most
beers
are
for
that
matter
could
certainly
kill
a
six
pack
of
these
and
be
more
than
merry

i
keep
underestimating
goldenpale
lagers
of
various
styles
and
keep
being
wrong
this
was
such
an
unexpected
taste
and
a
good
one
you
go
into
it
thinking
pilsner
and
expecting
the
tastes
of
czech
and
germany
but
at
the
first
sip
youre
getting
american
hops
like
in
a
pale
ale
its
a
real
curveball
it
was
full
flavored
and
delicious
and
made
me
want
to
keep
taking
another
sip
taste
like
there
is
some
rancid
bactericide
that
has
been
brewing
in
this
can
quite
a
disappointment
to
my
dismay
compared
to
the
overall
positive
reviews
of
this
pilsner
has
a
light
mouth
feel
a
sour
malty
sweetness
i
am
just
thankful
this
was
given
to
me
for
free
o
sessionable
beer
that
is
very
tasty
but
very
easy
to
drink
everything
about
this
brew
is
subtle
gentle
smooth
and
refreshing
a
great
thirst
quenching
beer
to
have
on
one
of
those
typically
steaming
hot
triple
shower
sweaty
ass
atlanta
georgia
days
that
invoke
wild
fantasys
about
moving
to
reykjavik
or
some
such
place
i
had
two
at
the
pool
on
a
90
degree
day
o
one
of
a
few
georgia
brewed
craft
lagers
fairly
average
for
the
style
i
heard
that
red
hare
micro
brewery
is
going
to
sell
their
gangway
ipa
in
cans
pretty
soon
as
well
overall
this
is
a
very
good
lager
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
as
the
first
local
beer
in
cans
this
one
will
be
in
my
fridge
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
o
as
the
can
says
it
is
very
refreshing
after
a
long
day
in
the
sun
in
the
summer
time
excellent
beer
to
take
a
6
pack
or
2
with
you
up
to
the
lake
on
a
hot
summer
day
also
great
to
find
a
local
brewery
getting
into
the
canning
movement
had
this
on
draft
quite
a
few
times
but
never
reviewed
it
was
released
in
cans
yesterday
and
i
got
one
of
the
first
6
packs
only
2
place
in
ga
got
it
in
yesterday
pours
a
clear
golden
color
foamy
white
head
doesnt
stick
around
a
long
time
but
what
do
you
expect
from
a
lager
taste
is
slightly
sweet
biscuit
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
could
easily
drink
all
i
have
in
the
fridge
tonight
if
i
didnt
work
tomorrow
lol
just
a
great
beer
from
a
brewery
right
down
the
street
from
me
overall
great
beer
and
if
you
live
in
the
marietta
ga
area
be
sure
to
stop
by
for
a
tour
there
over
the
weekend
bought
a
growler
at
whole
foods
recently
hazy
gold
appearance
with
a
decent
but
not
over
the
top
head
good
and
fresh
flavor
a
step
above
the
mass
produced
adjunct
lagers
for
sure
not
in
the
top
tier
but
a
very
drinkable
lager
for
a
hot
day
in
georgia
this
marietta
brewery
seems
to
know
their
climate
customers
and
beer
nice
clean
lager
real
nice
hoppiness
aroma
is
average
but
the
flavor
is
excellent
for
this
style
good
first
impression
from
red
hare
in
marietta
i
was
hoping
to
give
their
ipa
a
try
but
they
ran
out
at
ay
before
i
got
there
a
nice
autumn
lager
with
plenty
of
character
if
youre
introducing
your
bmc
buds
to
craft
beer
this
would
be
a
great
way
to
bring
them
over
to
the
dark
side
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
hazy
honey
golden
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
but
the
latter
may
be
an
artifact
of
the
pour
the
bartenders
at
summits
like
to
make
sure
you
get
maximum
beer
it
is
darker
than
most
lagers
i
have
sampled
a
good
sign
as
it
turns
out
the
head
does
leave
some
decent
lacing
malty
fruity
aroma
has
apple
and
cherry
notes
and
a
hint
of
hops
unusual
for
a
lager
in
my
experience
malty
and
surprisingly
hoppy
flavor
has
a
fruity
tone
and
subtle
hop
bitterness
smooth
firmbodied
fizzy
edgy
texture
leaves
a
malty
and
rather
hoppy
finish
somewhat
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
lager
ive
had
plenty
of
lagers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
overall
this
lager
carries
across
more
bitterness
than
for
me
is
desired
and
has
a
conspicuous
raw
graininess
throughout
leaving
me
without
the
crisp
refreshing
inviting
lager
im
looking
forward
to
after
a
long
day
a
very
good
pilsner
refreshing
and
tasty
overall
very
good
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
i
had
this
beer
at
the
end
of
a
hot
day
and
found
it
light
and
refreshing
great
summer
beer
complemented
my
paste
dinner
well
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
plis
a
very
nice
pilsner
crisp
airy
great
finish
seems
like
an
adequate
camping
beer
andor
something
good
for
beer
can
chicken
or
fondue
or
something
but
thats
about
it
average
pilsner
nothing
very
exciting
about
this
one
overall
this
is
okay
given
the
choice
between
the
good
to
great
pils
from
local
mn
ia
and
wi
breweries
though
not
sure
that
it
makes
sense
to
come
back
taste
starts
out
with
a
clean
grassy
bite
with
large
sweet
malt
balance
light
hint
of
lemon
zest
quickly
comes
and
goes
finishes
very
clean
and
dry
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
and
quite
crisp
i
recommend
drinking
very
cold
not
the
best
reviewer
of
pils
but
a
big
fan
of
oskar
blues
they
make
nice
flavorful
beers
in
each
style
this
is
a
nice
tasting
easy
drinking
beer
with
subtly
abundant
flavor
smooth
start
to
finish
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
and
a
good
one
to
give
to
a
newbie
or
wine
drinker
ill
use
this
a
standard
on
future
pils
o
a
drinkable
with
not
much
going
on
the
hop
flavor
and
aroma
is
muted
compared
to
most
czech
pilsners
im
in
no
hurry
to
buy
another
six
o
i
would
definitely
buy
more
of
this
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
to
texas
to
get
it
i
would
like
to
try
some
that
was
a
little
more
fresh
though
to
see
if
the
usual
spice
on
the
end
of
czech
pils
is
actually
present
or
not
and
to
see
how
the
hops
change
the
tastemouthfeel
very
enjoyable
even
as
is
though
o
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
pilsner
that
is
fairly
straightforward
which
is
the
point
nothing
is
going
to
blow
your
mind
here
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
disclaimer
poured
from
a
1
yr
old
can
smelled
like
musty
grains
taste
is
average
but
builds
into
a
honey
flavor
of
some
sort
its
not
real
crisp
or
refreshing
though
leaves
me
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
ill
drink
the
rest
ice
cold
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
nice
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
has
a
gain
and
slight
citrus
flavor
this
is
an
excellent
summer
time
beer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
not
too
heavy
but
has
a
lot
of
flavor
pours
a
lighter
golden
yellow
in
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
and
same
with
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
faint
and
is
of
roasted
malt
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
wow
really
good
and
packed
full
of
flavor
with
the
roasted
malt
right
up
front
with
some
sweetness
which
is
probably
from
the
caramel
malts
in
the
mix
as
well
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
no
harsh
or
biter
aftertaste
at
all
really
surprised
on
this
one
mediumbodied
with
perfect
lighter
carbonation
really
great
taste
a
little
cloudy
lacking
aroma
may
be
the
best
pilsener
i
have
ever
tasted
overall
this
is
definitely
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
had
and
honestly
one
of
the
best
session
beers
of
any
style
ive
ever
had
its
absolutely
fantastic
highly
recommended
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
pretty
solid
for
a
pils
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
intro
noncraft
drinkers
with
flavors
are
right
on
but
not
strong
so
wouldnt
throw
off
nu
bs
and
so
easy
smooth
and
creamy
to
drink
this
beer
will
be
in
my
regular
line
which
grows
to
long
for
times
when
im
not
looking
to
challenge
my
taste
buds
good
beer
good
color
and
flavor
overall
not
outstanding
but
a
worthwhile
pilsner
style
lager
poured
a
straw
colored
clear
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
one
inch
head
aroma
seemed
a
little
weak
with
some
light
yeast
cracker
and
some
slight
wine
notes
the
flavor
was
biscuity
malt
with
a
bit
of
of
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
heavy
for
a
pilsner
but
nice
nonetheless
overall
probably
not
the
greatest
example
of
a
pilsner
but
pretty
true
to
style
and
tasty
too
outlier
detected
most
lagers
dont
get
the
love
they
deserve
this
is
a
great
pilsener
i
havent
had
too
many
but
i
think
its
wonderful
for
the
style
so
bright
and
clean
with
lovely
floral
and
citrus
notes
nice
cracker
malt
on
the
end
to
balance
it
all
out
this
is
a
really
well
made
pilsner
the
hops
are
not
massively
prominent
but
give
up
enough
to
keep
this
interesting
light
bodied
with
well
balanced
carbonation
does
not
leave
a
sickly
corn
taste
like
many
other
lagerpils
beers
easy
to
drink
and
good
for
those
days
where
you
need
a
refreshing
toned
down
beer
to
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
to
really
freak
out
about
but
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
i
do
not
have
all
my
ratings
in
front
of
me
at
the
moment
but
id
say
its
just
as
good
as
any
other
beer
in
this
style
that
i
have
rated
condor
recommended
and
approved
poured

of
a
dry
pilsner
that
has
a

sweetness
to
keep
it
balanced
but
that
is
still

and
hoppier
than
it
is

a

overall
impression

refreshing
and
easy
to

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pilsner
it
is
hoppy
and
fairly
dry
in
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
nice
refreshing
mouthfeel
a
good
example
of
what
the
style
can
be
when
done
properly
really
not
a
fan
of
pilsners
mouthfeel
a
bit
to
heavy
for
a
czech
pils
the
hops
are
way
too

all
i
detect
theres
just
a

very
clean
finish
the
mouth
is
dry
and
very
smooth
draft
pint
at
the
soft
opening
of
tanners
lakeside
its
a
hoppy
pilsner
that
is
definitely
a
decent
enough
beer
its
got
the
right
amount
of
hops
in
it
and
the
texture
is
smooth
golden
color
good
malt
taste
nice
finish
and
after
taste
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
a
good
clean
taste
nice
finish
and
great
overall
beer
this
is
a
good
pilsener
i
think
its
pretty
representative
of
the
european
style
from
which
it
is
derived
i
had
a
friend
who
drinks
american
pilsners
and
he
felt
it
was
way
too
hoppy
but
to
me
it
was
just
right
i
felt
it
had
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
bready
malitiness
crisp
and
well
flavored
for
the
style
when
i
catch
it
on
sale
i
will
purchase
it
again
my
only
complaint
is
that
similar
quality
breweries
have
similar
beers
for
better
prices
nevertheless
its
a
solid
pils
this
is
oskar
blues
pilsner
and
its
pretty
good
though
maybe
a
touch
heavy
for
the
style
ill
drink
this
one
but
i
think
there
are
better
pilsners
made
in
these
parts
they
have
mastered
the
canning
process
with
their
beers
so
it
still
tastes
nice
and
fresh
and
its
very
portable
light
and
drinkable
pilsner
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
but
also
not
very
complex

citrusy

i

shouldnt

i
can

other
reviews
that
mention
corn
and
easy

and
miles
above
most
noncraft
lagers
doesnt
quite
have
that
czech
pils
snap
though
edit
ok
its
supposed
to
be
this
sweet
and
lame
in
which
case
ok
quaffer
but
very
not
to
style
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
very
nice
on
a
hot
day
certainly
hit
the
spot
for
me
o
this
would
be
a
dangerous
beer
on
a
hot
day
easy
to
drink
nice
representation
of
the
style
o
not
a
style
i
usually
try
but
a
very
nice
beer
for
the
summer
months
now
i
can
say
i
had
a
real
craft
pilsner
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
take
to
the
beach
since
it
comes
in
cans
and
is
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
wish
this
was
fresher
and
might
have
to
look
for
a
new
can
someday
if
you
like
pilsners
give
this
one
a
try
cheers
overall
im
looking
for
more
bitterness
especially
if
its
listed
as
a
czech
pilsner
not
enough
bite
awesome
beer
o
average
at
best
better
examples
can
be
found
o
i
kept
thinking
it
was
like
a
miller
lite
with
ingredient
improvements
which
i
suppose
could
mean
this
may
be
the
most
perfect
bridge
beer
on
earth
craft
beer
with
training
wheels
not
a
bad
brew
but
for
the
price
i
can
do
a
lot
better
one
time
buy
o
considering
all
the
good
pilsener
options
out
there
this
brew
is
a
definite
oneoff
for
me
honestly
id
rather
drink
a
budweiser
no
hop
bite
no
hop
spiciness
or
grassiness
no
barley
sweetness
its
just
not
that
good
overall
this
is
definitely
a
most
excellent
beer
and
represents
the
style
well
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
the
beer
is
well
made
and
appropriate
for
its
style
however
it
has
that
what
i
would
describe
as
german
malt
taste
to
it
it
pours
really
nice
leaving
a
one
inch
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
definitely
not
a
style
i
would
get
again
from
that
brewery
but
i
would
like
to
try
other
beers
they
make
final
grade

for

fans
the
world
over

one
nails
what
i
like
about
the
style
while
offering
just
a
little
more
hop
kick
than
some
of
the
lesser
czech
imports
not
an
attentiongrabber
but
still
a
very
solid
session
brew
that
i
plan
to
enjoy
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
i
like
it
despite
some
dings
but
should
really
judge
it
nice
and
fresh

excited
for

overall
a
pleasant
experience
with
this
pilsner
o
i
like
most
ob
beers
but
this
isnt
a
great
pils
o
heavier
and
more
flavorful
than
a
traditional
lager
tastes
a
bit
better
than
your
standard
pilsner
but
costs
more
as
well
however
it
is
5

abv
for
those
that
follow
that
kind
of
thing
i
would
definitely
recommend
to
anyone
to
try
at
least
once
overall
not
as
crisp
as
a
pils
should
be
but
good
malt
character
and
decent
hops
a
bit

the
part

the

and
flavour
have
a
satisfying
blend
of
subtle
noble

notes
and
light

perhaps
a
shade
hoppier
than
a
european
pilsner
would
be
though
nothing

the
only
thing
lacking
is
the
extra

that
comes

you

do
worse
o
i
love
oskar
blues
beers
one
of
my
favorite
brewerys
every
beer
i
have
tried
has
been
above
average
or
excellent
o
this
is
solid
american
take
on
a
czech
pils
its
complexity
is
lacking
compared
to
some
of
the
better
european
versions
but
that
doesnt
make
this
a
bad
beer
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
in
the
finish
than
i
was
expecting
and
has
a
surprisingly
full
mouthfeel
for
the
style
very
refreshing
and
very
tasty
overall
mild
but
exceedingly
well
made
pilsner
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
was
not
expecting
much
this
is
an
excellent
pilsener
however
it
is
more
in
the
german
style
than
czech
the
bitterness
and
hopping
rate
are
more
appropriate
to
the
german
pils
despite
this
its
a
great
beer
and
something
i
would
buy
more
of
up
there
with
victory
lagunitas
avery
new
belgium
and
summit
as
far
as
high
quality
american
made
pilsners
go
recommended
without
reservation
poured
this
into

glass
came
out
a
rich
gold
tone
with
a
soapy
white
head
large
and
retained
for
quite
some
time
aroma
doesnt
offer
much
but
the
alcohol
flavor
wise
im
not
displeased
its
not
an
unpleasant
drink
there
was
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
nice
full
mouth
feel
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
with
a
fizzy
head
nose
is
soft
and
grassy
sweet
hay
and
corn
husk
flavor
is
lightly
grainy
with
naval
oranges
sweet
corn
and
black
tea
all
going
on
my
girlfriend
says
it
tastes
like
lipton
iced
tea
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
less
carbonation
than
your
typical
allamerican
lager
a
wonderful
tasting
pilsner
and
another
winner
from
oskar
blues
brewery
o
im
a
huge
oskar
blues
fan
but
this
is
the
first
beer
from
them
that
im
not
totally
sold
on
i
like
the
slight
hoppiness
but
i
feel
it
lacks
a
certain
sweetness
and
body
that
i
like
in
a
pilsner
its
still
certainly
an
enjoyable
beer
but
ill
be
sticking
with
dales
pale
ale
overall
one
of
the
better
american
pilsners

send
this

into

final
thoughts
pretty
great
example
of
the
style
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
character
to
keep
things
crisp
another
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
o
for
whatever
reason
i
was
expecting
more
but
that
being
said
this
is
a
decent
lawn
mower
beer
not
sure
if
i
would
purchase
it
again
but
if
offered
a
can
not
a
problem

a

it

beautiful

if
a

plain
not
my
thing
but
if
you
like
pils
be
sure
to
check
it
out
not
one
of
obs
better
beers
for
me
flavorful
and
more
than
drinkable
this
is
a
solid
craft
pilsner
o
getting
a
good
craft
lager
thats
this
cheap
8
for
a

is
tough
to
find
but
fortunately
i
got
this
fresh
and
was
ended
up
satisfied
nothing
spectacular
about
this
beer
just
flavorful
and
easydrinking
with
a
decent
heft
for
a
canned

under

sometimes
thats
all
you
need
glad
i
got
six
cheers
nice
pils
nothing
crazy
and
no
reason
for
me
to
buy
this
all
the
time
but
it
is
real
damn
refreshing
overall
best
pilsner
ive
ever
had
honestly
im
really
happy
with
this
beer
but
i
love
pils
o
upscale
pabst
remarkable
for
being
satisfactorily
plain
wellblended
with
a
bit
more
character
than
pabst
or
natty
boh
a
decent
pil
but
way
over
priced
here
in
alberta
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
values
just
not
there
and
i
doubt
ill
be
drinking
this
again
anytime
soon
a
genuinely
tasty
pilsener
with
strong
bohemian
predilections
however
the
hops
seem
to
be
lost
in
translation
the
grassy
mildly
sulfuric
nature
of
the
original
just
isnt
found
here
now
while
out
of
design
or
oversight
it
takes
a
minor
chunk
out
of
the
overall
enjoyment
which
is
to
say
90
percent
or
so
of
the
real
deal
is
still
rather
worthy
of
drinking
the
hell
out
of
an
fairly
alright
tasting
beer
maybe
a
bit
to
much
lemon
for
me
i
do
love
fresh
lemonade
but
when
im
drinking
beer
ummm
this
is
light
bodied
and
modestly
carbonated
overall
not
bad
but
a
strang
sweetness
verse
bitterness
contrast
is
present
that
breaks
up
its
otherwise
crisp
feel
and
leaves
it
slightly
unbalanced
in
the
malty
spectrum
overall
this
beer
is
completely
disappointing
due
to
the
light
body
and
lack
of
malt
flavors
to
compliment
the
hops
and
bitterness
save
your
money
and
buy
a
budweiser
over
this
stuff
sorry
to
say

does
it
for
me
its
a
great
go
to
during
a
football
game
bbq
or
as
aneveryday
beer
easy
drinking
not
a
bank
breaker
and
wont
compromise
your
palate
while
deciding
on
what
beer
you
are
going
to
order
next
im
a
big
fan
on
craft
cans
all
in
all
but
this
little
guy
is
a
ringer
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
pilsner
nothing
too
exciting
but
imo
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
style
its
crispness
and
light
body
would
make
this
a
great
session
choice
with
an
above
average
abv
relative
to
macro
american
pilsners
and
great
taste
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
first
step
into
the
craft
world
for
someone
who
is
a
staunch
bmc
drinker
overall
good
pilsner
not
my
favorite
style
personally
but
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
12
ounce
can

canned
on
2252013
pours
lightly
hazy
and
cloudy
golden

color
with
a
nice
12
finger
dense
and
fluffy
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
nice
soapy
lacing

down
the
glass
with
a
light
amount
of
streaming
carbonation

after
the

overall
this
is
a
nice

style
good
balance
of
hop

and

flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
atmosphere
is
really
strong
dark
gold
continual
effervescence
large
foamy
head
which
never
fully
dissipates
and
plenty
of
persistent
lacing
nose
is
characteristic
sourdough
bread
hay
and
some
spice
pale
and
crisp
thick
and
hearty
grains
and
a
little
more
hop
than
one
would
expect
for
the
style
a
bit
of
an
offputting
lingering
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
i
rather
like
the
beer
as
it
is
lighter
drier
and
crisper
in
body
than
what
i
was
expecting
not
as
rich
or
with
as
many
softly
complex
notes
as
traditional
czech
lagers
but
as
a
nondescript
eurostyle
lager
the
beer
satisfies
the
taste
and
thirst
just
fine
o
this
is
a
very
middle
of
the
road
pilsner
for
me
honestly
i
cant
think
of
anything
in
particular
that
would
make
me
want
to
revisit
this
one
i
would
probably
just
go
for
the
cheaper
budweiser
as
much
as
it
pains
me
to
say
it
love
a
lot
of
oskar
blues
beer
but
this
one
is
just
alright
but
everything
about
this
was
clean
which
i
also
find
very
worthwhile
its
one
of
the
beers
that
i
would
define
as
chuggable
overall
im
vacillating
on
this
one
i
would
definitely
give
it
a
try
its
not
a
bad
pilsner
even
if
it
isnt
very
traditional
above
average
brew
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
take
on
hit
or
miss
style
i
was
expected
an
american
take
on
the
pils
with
hops
hops
hops
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
would
drink
it
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
especially
from
this
brewery
poured
from
a
355ml
can
pours
a
bright
rich
yellow
colour
nose
is
mostly
funky
and
grainy
not
much
beyond
that
taste
is
dry
and
tart
with
cereal
and
earthy
noble
hops
notes
refreshing
good
carbonation
and
definitely
best
served
real
cold
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
clear
amber
with
frothy
white
head
little
lacing
aroma
of
earthy
hops
and
some
spice
flavor
follows
aroma
with
decent
malt
to
balance
the
spicy
hop
character
light
body
with
mild
carbonation
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
pils
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
a
great
starter
before
moving
on
to
the
heavier
artillery
a
good
session
beer
i
assume
but
i
only
have
one
i
recommend
little
yella
pils
if
you
want
to
try
a
traditional
pilsner
that
uses
fresh
ingredients
in
the
perfect
balance
nice
job
oskar
blues
o
a
very
good
beer
and
a
definite
departure
from
dales
the
last
oskar
blues
beer
i
tried
would
definitely
buy
again
except
the
price
is
a
little
high
in
my
area
at
2
50
per
12
oz
can
very
nice
refreshing
pils
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
nothing
extra
o
overall
a
pretty
average
pils
oskar
blues
makes
a
lot
of
good
beers
but
this
is
my
least
favorite
from
their
staples
nose
is
a
bit
funky
and
there
just
isnt
a
lot
to
it
would
skip
for
their
other
offerings
o
earthy
hoppiness
is
nice
and
this
pils
is
pretty
well
balanced
overall
excellent
summer
beer
overall
brilliant
beer
that
im
glad
i
discovered
in
nc
if
it
was
available
in
il
id
put
it
in
my
fridge
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
and
a
good
pilsner
on
a
hot
day
such
as
this
it
hits
the
spot
however
due
to
the
price
tag
and
lack
of
availability
i
dont
think
ill
be
getting
this
again
for
a
while
still
a
solid
craft
brewed
canned
pils
o
nice
beer
although
i
have
a
hard
time
placing
it
when
i
bought
it
i
thought
it
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
but
it
wasnt
quite
there
i
think
i
would
place
this
somewhere
closer
to
october
as
far
as
when
i
would
prefer
to
drink
it
it
was
good
but
i
dont
consider
it
a
great
value
especially
at
12pack
pricing
a
decent
enough
pilsner
overall
the
appearance
is
the
best
feature
of
an
otherwise
slightly
above
average
flavor
although
nothing
really
stands
out
this
beer
still
warrants
repeat
visits
when
a
simple
lagerstyled
brew
is
what
youre
looking
for
overall
i
wont
say
this
is
my
favorite
pilsner
but
its
definitely
a
very
solid
one
and
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
especially
for
summer
time
drinking
with
spicy
barbeque
ill
be
drinking
this
with
chicken
and
ribs
over
the
fourth
of
july
weekend
i
love
a
good
pilsner
cheers
bring
this
to
a
cookout
picnic
or
clambake
it
goes
with
just
about
any
standard
far
great
with
lobsterhold
the
butter
and
may
convert
a
few
hop
heads
and
the
uninitiated
alike
o
nothing
amazing
even
when
you
stack
it
up
against
other
pilsners
but
its
nice
as
far
as
something
to
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
at
the
beach
not
a
terrible
beer
just
wasnt
all
that
great
in
my
opinion
light
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
heavy
chill
haze
poured
with
a
short
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
a
nice
balance
of
bready
malt
and
floral
hop
aromas
medium
bodied
with
refreshing
tangy
carbonation
light
bready
malt
flavor
up
followed
by
a
wave
of
floral
hops
into
the
middle
crisp
tangy
hop
bite
through
the
middle
to
end
finished
crisply
with
a
rush
of
bready
malt
followed
by
lingering
floral
hop
bitterness
nicely
balanced
throughout
overall
this
is
a
good
pilsner
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
would
not
buy
this
i
only
had
it
because
my
roomate
shared
it
with
me
overall
a
very
good
pilsner
true
to
the
czech
style
i
would
place
this
just
behind
victory
prima
pils
and
staropramen
my
benchmark
for
the
style
as
my
favorite
pilsners
for
the
price
you
cannot
beat
the
quality
of
this
beer
its
literally
50
more
than
a
bud
light
tallboy
take
your
typical
adjunct
pils
and
add
a
little
more
flavor
complexity
and
this
is
what
you
get
so
this
lil
thing
needs
to
be
taken
for
what
it
is
a
very
good
version
of
a
rather
benign
genre
sweet
malts
cereal
grains
and
a
bready
dough
flavor
dominate
a
smooth
drinkability
nothing
more
nothing
nothing
less
oi
went
through
a
phase
in
which
i
downed
a
lot
of
yella
pils
but
now
i
am
not
sure
why
consumed
cold
at
38
degrees
from
the
fridge
this
beer
was
still
not
very
refreshing
or
crisp
in
the
manner
i
would
expect
from
a
pils
it
is
just
too
sweet
and
heavy
for
the
style
which
hurts
in
the
drinkability
category
on
the
plus
side
it
does
pack
flavor
even
if
the
flavors
arent
that
great
generally
enjoy
good
pilsners
and
lighter
crafts
love
ob
in
general
too
this
one
has
high
marks
but
as
my
drinking
partner
says
it
tastes
like
foot
o
this
has
been
available
on
the
shelves
around
here
for
quite
awhile
and
i
just
hadnt
gotten
around
to
trying
it
it
was
good
for
what
it
is
though
still
not
my
favorite
style
o
3
50
i
unfortunately
had
higher
expectations
going
into
this
pour
based
on
the
reputation
of
oskar
blues
the
greatest
applause
i
can
give
this
beer
unfortunately
is
that
its
an
easytodrink
lawnmower
beer
however
it
looks
better
than
it
tastes
which
is
mostly
bland
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
again
and
would
reach
for
some
of
the
american
germanstyle
pils
instead
sort
of
disappointed
typically
like
pilseners
and
i
did
like
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
my
favorite
pils
tasted
good
especially
when
it
warmed
a
bit
but
nothing
that
will
make
me
rush
out
and
buy
it
again
had
this
on
tap
at
legal
harborside
this
was
a
decent
pilsner
for
a
nice
warm
summer
say
the
taste
was
very
crisp
and
light
the
appearance
was
a
bit
hazy
for
a
pilsner
but
it
still
looked
tasty
no
real
taste
in
my
opinion
other
than
a
touch
of
malt
which
is
kinda
nice
sometimes
the
scent
was
a
touch
dank
so
not
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
not
my
favorite
pilsner
but
a
nice
effort
it
does
not
have
the
cleanness
as
the
czech
pilsners
that
i
prefer
its
quite
a
decent
beer
but
lacks
the
lager
cleanness
that
i
prefer
overall
a
nice
but
pretty
basic
pils
really
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
the
likes
of
pilsner
urquell
or
budvar
in
my
opinion
on
tap
at
a
bar
in
a
shaker
glass
decent
white
head
that
stayed
for
a
couple
minutes
then
dissipated
as
drinking
commenced
not
much
aroma
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
on
the
nose
bready
malty
up
front
not
so
pleasant
bitterness
at
the
end
its
ok
but
there
are
much
better
examples
serving
type
can
solid
pilsener
first
time
having
it
nothing
mindblowing
but
it
serves
its
purpose
o
misses
the
mark
for
me
the
overly
subdued
noble
spiciness
and
cereal
like
tones
dont
quite
agree
with
my
palate
very
good
for
a
pilsner
highly
drinkable
tasty
o
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
unfortunately
it
not
a
great
version
of
this
style
overall
its
a
great
beer
for
fishin
and
pretty
darn
tasty
stuff
another
good
product
from
ob
this
is
a
decent
canned
beer
a
very
refreshing
excellent
tasting
session
beer
a
must
have
for
summer
time
ill
be
keeping
this
in
my
fridge
all
summer
long
have
i
had
better
pilsners
yeah
but
this
one
certainly
isnt
awful
i
dont
know
if
it
should
be
labeled
a
czech
pilsner

a
good
beer
its
soft
and
smooth
and
not
overly
spicy
as
a
lot
of
pilsners
seem
to
be
now
a
days
more
to
style
o
overall
this
beer
is
wonderful
light
and
refreshing
while
complex
and
delicious
an
amazing
beer
to
throw
in
the
cooler
and
take
with
you
on
the
run
but
still
worthy
of
a
place
in
your
fridge
any
day
mo
light
body
medium
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
just
nothing
too
crazy
going
on
but
i
do
prefer
it
over
most
macros
good
for
its
style
but
there
are
far
better
craft
pilsners
o
its
decent
best
quality
is
its
refreshing
abilities
i
enjoy
more
hops
in
pilseners
which
i
know
gets
away
from
the
style
but
im
not
ordinary
i
once
bit
a
kid
to
death
overall
a
easy
drinker
great
summer
beer
bbqs
or
good
to
drink
a
few
of
nothing
groundbreaking
here
just
a
solid
pils
a
good
value
but
ill
try
some
other
pils
before
i
return
to
this
one
my
go
to
pilsner
at
this
point
o
a
good
but
not
great
pilsner
overpriced
although
this
may
be
hard
to
beat
if
you
must
have
it
in
a
can
overall
a
rather
honeyed
sweet
version
of
a
czech
pils
hops
are
present
but
could
be
more
substantial
a
pretty
solid
pils
taste
nice
and
fresh
these
cans
definitly
help
a
style
like
this
a
good
pilsner
nothing
fancy
but
par
for
the
course
crisp
clean
and
fresh
great
on
a
summer
day
this
pours
golden
and
has
nice
chunky
head
for
a
pilsner
there
is
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
because
it
is
a
pilsner
it
reminds
me
of
a
bmc
but
much
more
crafted
i
can
smell
and
taste
more
hops
and
malt
and
this
has
some
refreshing
qualities
overall
i
dont
love
this
beer
based
on
the
style
i
got
it
on
sale
and
it
beats
any
other
canned
pilsner
overall
nothing
here
that
will
blow
you
away
but
its
is
still
a
very
nice
tasting
ans
refreshing
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
whole
bunch
of
these
on
a
camping
trip
this
summer
i
bought
one
can
of
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
now
i
need
to
get
a
case
of
it
absolutely
incredible
pilsner
mamas
little
yella
pils
pours
a
thick
yellowishorange
color
with
only
a
gentle
head
that
quickly
recedes
the
smell
is
mild
but
citrusy
with
perhaps
just
a
hint
of
yeast
to
it
little
yella
pils
is
cool
crisp
and
refreshing
perfectly
capturing
summer
in
a
can
with
a
mouthfeel
that
puts
the
major
brands
to
shame
this
is
a
nononsense
session
beer
bright
and
frisky
its
a
refreshing
change
to
the
neverending
parade
of
american
ipas
have
one
you
wont
regret
it
notes
this
wellbalanced
pils
is
a
real
treat
light
to
medium
in
body
along
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
to
give
it
a
lively
refreshing
mouthfeel
quite
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
summer
grilling
or
just
hanging
out
on
the
deck
taste
cracker
like
with
a
noble
hop
backbone
and
slightly
lemony
tart
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
and
dry
overall
i
found
the
taste
enjoyable
and
refreshing
but
a
bit
thin
and
the
same
with
the
mouthfeel
ironically
the
thinness
though
not
my
preference
is
why
i
might
come
back
to
this
beer
because
i
suspect
my
wife
will
love
it
recommended
fullerbodied
and
creamier
than
a
normal
pilsner
is
the
first
thing
i
notice
then
i
catch
a
fairly
strong
lemon
taste
followed
by
some
citrusy
hops
and
a
slight
wheat
beer
taste
that
seems
strange
to
me
considering
the
style
however
that
being
said
i
really
like
it
its
a
different
take
on
things
which
is
okay
by
me
with
ob
not
the
most
refreshing
pils
ive
ever
had
but
i
also
wouldnt
say
no
to
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
beer
that
id
probably
drink
again
great
brew
consistent
and
delicious
nice
work
oskar
o
a
pretty
good
easy
drinker
hop
characteristic
is
nice
malts
just
form
a
baseline
i
like
it
a
fantastically
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
those
hot
summer
days
final
thought
pils
fans
this
one
is
for
you
straight
from
the
can
to
my
tulip
it
pours
a
golden
color
that
actually
matches
the
gold
color
on
the
can
it
has
a
nice
white
foamy
head
with
pretty
nice
lacing
it
has
a
heavy
velvety
mouthfeel
for
a
pilsner
with
medium
carbonation
it
is
very
tasty
fruit
forward
notes
with
a
malty
middle
and
a
slight
hoppy
floral
finish
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
pilsner
from
a
can
this
will
definitely
be
a
staple
during
the
summer
time
whenever
i
am
going
poolside
or
where
glass
if
frowned
upon
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
very
drinkable
and
light
while
maintaining
lots
of
flavor
o
a
good
beer
i
would
however
probably
stick
with
something
more
local
and
a
little
less
expensive
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
oskar
blues
releases
ive
had
thus
far
this
beer
pours
as
a
clear
yellow
color
with
foamy
white
head
that
has
a
pretty
good
lacing
for
a
little
while
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
a
little
hoppy
the
taste
was
kinda
bland
there
was
some
malts
and
hops
in
the
flavor
but
thats
about
all
not
too
much
else
really
happening
in
this
brew
i
suppose
this
is
better
if
you
reay
like
those
types
of
beers
but
to
me
theyre
a
little
boring
an
great
pilsner
that
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
again
o
i
do
like
a
well
brewed
pilsner
but
this
example
is
not
far
off
from
the
watery
macro
pils
maybe
that
was
their
goal
either
way
i
wont
be
having
this
again
o
pilseners
really
arent
my
thing
but
this
one
is
very
well
done
brought
these
to
a
recent
tailgate
and
they
were
perfect
overall
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
i
mean
if
people
like
it
go
for
it
maybe
this
style
just
doesnt
work
for
me
i
am
no
expert
on
this
style
but
i
am
trying
to
be
subjective
other
than
deschutes
18th
anniversary
which
was
fantastic
i
dont
think
ive
had
much
pilsner
i
think
there
is
a
reason
why
its
light
and
watery
chick
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
good
beverage
to
have
when
you
dont
want
to
think
too
much
about
flavor
profile
this
is
a
straightforward
refreshing
beverage
that
im
happy
to
drink
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
however
for
the
price
i
paid
it
definitely
wasnt
worth
it
part
of
the
motivation
was
the
can
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
pilsners
out
there
in
bottles
i
probably
will
not
buy
it
again
o
i
would
definitely
have
a
hard
time
drinking
two
of
these
back
to
back
this
was
just
soso
oskar
blues
products
are
bit
expensive
in
ca
id
buy
this
for
7
99
a
six
pack
but
no
more
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
i
definitely
didnt
expect
it
to
be
this
cloudy
but
it
looks
good
and
kind
of
like
a
saison
it
smells
of
pale
malt
light
honey
and
very
light
hops
the
flavor
is
kind
of
flat
and
uninspired
its
just
the
usual
pilsner
it
drinks
a
little
thicker
for
the
style
but
in
a
good
way
this
beer
is
just
average
but
its
nice
to
see
a
pilsner
in
a
can
that
isnt
bmc
poured
from
the
can
into
my
duvel
tulip
this
is
what
bmc
pilsners
aspire
to
be
smell
was
mildly
hoppy
and
sweet
nice
yellow
spritzy
color
taste
was
basic
but
delicious
i
can
tell
this
would
be
great
for
a
day
of
yardwork
mouthfeel
was
light
but
still
flavorful
overall
a
good
choice
mamas
little
yella
pils
has
a
yellow
colour
and
a
5
mm
head
the
smell
isnt
particularly
strong
but
there
is
some
noticeable
hops
and
grains
the
flavour
is
hoppy
and
grainy
this
is
one
of
the
nicer
pilsners
ive
had
its
foamy
and
fresh
tasting
on
tap
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
head
good
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
grass
hops
yeast
and
slightly
sour
taste
is
a
slight
hop
flavor
with
a
cut
grass
taste
light
and
crisp
lemon
peel
aftertaste
overall
it
is
a
pretty
decent
pils
and
i
will
look
for
this
when
summer
rolls
around
d
yella
pils
is
very
refreshing
with
the
lemony
taste
that
dazzles
in
musty
flavor
i
can
definitely
optimize
the
can
aspects
and
dunk
some
pilsner
if
you
know
what
i
mean
the
beer
is
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
faded
quickly
the
beer
smells
of
lemon
and
tea
and
it
seemed
a
bit
sour
and
it
had
some
floral
hop
aromas
it
tastes
lemony
and
yeasty
there
is
a
bready
background
and
a
citrusy
bitter
aftertaste
the
beer
is
light
with
lots
of
prickly
carbonation
it
finishes
pretty
dry
this
is
a
really
good
pilsner
different
than
most
and
it
has
a
nice
hop
profile
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
thicker
than
what
id
expect
from
a
pilsener
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinker
and
has
a
moderate
abv
probably
not
something
id
pick
up
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
mouthfeel
is
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
this
beer
is
a
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
see
myself
bringing
this
along
on
a
hot
summer
camping
trip
easy
drinking
good
pils
could
get
one
dimensional
definitely
a
quencher
for
those
long
summer
days
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
this
one
up
long
ago
it
fits
in
nicely
with
pu
victory
prima
pils
paulaner
premium
pils
and
other
great
pilsners
love
ya
oskar
blues
but
ill
stick
with
my
dales
and
gordon
excuse
me
gknight
another
study
in
my
never
ending
attempt
to
distinguish
between
german
and
czech
pilsners
has
a
more
solid
yellow
color
which
has
me
put
a
check
in
the
czech
column
the
smell
and
taste
are
much
drier
and
hoppier
the
malt
not
being
so
sweet
but
more
cerealy
and
bready
after
drinking
it
i
was
convinced
it
was
german
apparently
im
wrong
good
beer
though
bought
a
can
at
brendan
behan
pub
in
jp
last
night
for
5
smell
had
a
fresh
pils
aroma
to
it
nothing
like
some
of
the
skunky
german
ones
you
might
come
across
cant
beat
the
freshness
of
a
can
taste
was
clean
and
crisp
and
refreshing
which
is
what
i
wanted
after
dinner
and
a
few
other
beers
mouthfeel
was
light
and
bubbly
which
is
what
a
pils
should
be
easily
drinkable
as
its
smooth
light
and
low
in
abv
nothing
fancy
just
a
well
made
pilsner
to
consume
at
ease
d
i
could
crush
about
12
of
these
and
make
an
ass
out
of
my
self
drink
it
was
smooth
balanced
and
easy
to
pound
a
few
of
them
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
but
i
love
oskar
blues
offerings
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
shot
a
pretty
golden
yellow
in
color
with
minimal
head
tastes
like
a
well
made
pilsnerif
this
is
your
style
of
beer
youll
probably
like
this
offering
however
if
you
are
a
fan
if
this
style
try
sierra
nevadas
summerfest
which
is
also
a
good
offering
treated
to
some
lasting
offwhite
rocky
foam
yet
the
liquid
below
is
fooddye
yellow
with
a
bit
of
an
unfiltered
hazy
look
hmm
the
hopping
is
appropriate
floral
and
lightly
grassy
more
sharp
than
spicy
but
light
all
the
same
whats
also
registering
light
is
some
lemon
peel
or
orange
flavors
via
the
hops
enhancingaccenting
the
sweetness
of
whats
a
morethantraditional
maltforward
taste
cereal
grain
qualities
to
the
malt
and
dextrins
seem
to
be
pumped
up
a
bit
more
than
needed
albeit
consistent
with
their
other
lighter
beers
it
wants
to
flow
more
clean
and
smooth
but
just
enough
sticky
sugar
gets
left
behind
to
render
it
unrefreshing
id
deem
it
a
worthy
effort
either
way
typically
a
fan
of
all
oskar
blues
beers
this
is
a
good
beer
that
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
i
look
forward
to
pulling
one
from
a
friends
cooler
this
summer
but
will
buy
the
other
ob
options
d
decently
flavored
and
pretty
low
abv
very
solid
brew
to
kick
back
with
pours
a
typical
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
nice
fluffy
barely
offwhite
head
normally
this
is
a
turnoff
for
me
but
since
this
is
a
pilsner
ill
accept
this
as
good
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
fruity
not
strong
but
still
appealing
rich
flavor
fills
the
mouth
with
malt
as
well
as
hints
of
hops
and
pear
lively
fizzy
texture
leaves
behind
a
fairly
persistent
tingle
this
is
probably
my
favorite
among
all
of
the
pilsners
i
have
tried
beer
is
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
short
lasting
finger
of
white
head
flowery
hops
grain
and
earthiness
on
the
nose
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
sweeter
than
the
smell
the
flowers
turned
to
grass
as
well
thicker
than
most
pilseners
that
ive
had
before
granted
thats
probably
less
than
10
so
far
i
tend
to
like
a
lighter
feel
in
other
members
of
this
style
though
drinkability
is
still
excellent
though
and
ill
be
buying
more
as
it
warms
up
this
year
in
dallas
d
very
drinkable
with
it
being
so
light
and
bubblely
good
but
not
great
i
didnt
care
for
the
yeast
tones
overall
decent
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
anything
exceptional
nothing
id
want
to
stockpile
in
the
fridge
and
missing
complexities
that
i
like
in
pils
overall
god
i
wish
i
did
not
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
crap
is
this
the
way
this
beer
always
drinks
sam
adams
noble
pils
and
lagunitas
pils
are
way
better
then
this
d
very
drinkable
especially
with
the
woodfired
pizza
i
had
it
with
poured
a
medium
hazy
yellow
with
an
average
sized
fizzy
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
grain
malts
an
earthy
yeast
with
a
nice
blending
of
flowery
hops
it
tasted
refreshingly
bitter
and
a
little
acidic
from
beginning
to
end
with
the
end
having
a
nice
mildly
bitter
tinge
that
stayed
with
you
for
just
a
little
while
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
dry
in
texture
with
a
lively
carbonation
overall
a
great
pilsener
quite
drinkable
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
because
pilsners
usually
are
not
my
thing
all
and
all
a
solid
offering
from
oskar
blues
however
with
all
that
being
said
i
probably
would
buy
it
again
here
in
central
pa
it
will
run
you
about
40
a
case
there
are
cheaper
options
that
taste
just
as
good
worth
a
try
but
maybe
priced
just
a
bit
high
for
what
ya
get
o
standard
pale
lager
this
is
what
the
bmc
offerings
should
be
one
thing
to
note
that
isnt
present
is
the
rice
and
corn
adjuncts
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pale
lager
czech
pilsener
might
be
a
stretch
perfect
for
those
hot
summer
days
as
for
the
drink
its
so
easy
its
a
nice
crisp
pilsener
that
goes
down
very
smooth
its
a
great
respresenation
of
the
style
probably
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
since
i
started
my
reviews
in
sept
good
floral
hop
character
to
the
beer
springs
light
on
its
feet
textural
heft
isnt
its
thing
but
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
for
having
the
feel
of
a
light
beer
great
hopping
for
a
pilsner
and
in
a
can
makes
it
one
of
the
best
options
for
an
active
lifestyle
and
drinking
m
d
thin
body
medium
co2
dry
finish
the
flavor
did
not
inspire
motivated
drinking
o
a
crisp
clean
refreshing
example
of
a
czech
pils
very
little
fault
in
clarity
only
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
fairly
average
effort
id
say
nothing
that
strikes
me
as
special
this
is
a
favorite
style
of
mine
and
id
probably
go
for
a
beer
from
germany
or
the
czech
republic
if
i
wanted
one
cheers
another
good
beer
by
oskar
blues
from
the
355
ml
can
canned
on
0901100849
sampled
on
january
16
2011
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
fizzy
short
lasting
thin
head
the
aroma
has
a
decent
enough
malty
and
grainy
character
the
body
has
a
sort
of
slick
thickness
to
it
the
taste
is
vaguely
sour
which
highlights
its
light
hoppiness
there
is
also
a
kind
of
biscuitlike
after
effect
unfortunately
my
mama
thinks
old
milwaukee
is
a
little
yella
pils
well
oskar
blues
mama
got
it
pretty
good
there
wasnt
much
head
and
we
all
like
a
little
head
right
fellas
the
color
was
clear
and
goldenyella
i
couldnt
smell
much
primarily
due
to
just
getting
over
a
sinus
infection
tmi
sorry
i
tasted
a
hint
of
clove
which
added
a
neat
surprise
and
i
am
not
a
real
fan
of
clove
definitely
a
session
beer
but
so
is
pils
urquell
very
drinkable
white
head
crackles
but
the
lacing
stays
shiny
sunspotyellow
color
from
freshcut
grass
to
perfumelike
wild
flowers
to
bready
tones
a
lively
aroma
surprisingly
big
crispness
from
a
can
which
accentuates
the
hop
bitter
ness
to
produce
a
refreshing
snap
and
bite
a
clean
bready
malt
comes
up
on
the
palate
slowly
forming
its
needed
base
a
standup
malt
and
wellplaced
hop
complexities
make
it
very
well
balanced
a
sheer
delight
to
quaff
the
earth
may
not
shake
with
each
sip
but
it
does
its
job
and
a
damn
good
job
it
does
db
not
overly
drinkable
for
a
fairly
light
beer
seems
appropriate
for
the
style
solid
but
a
bit
too
sweet
d
very
easy
to
drink
although
this
is
sweeter
than
i
would
prefer
for
a
pilsener
its
never
cloying
and
i
went
through
the
glass
pretty
quickly
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
it
werent
winter
if
you
dont
like
grassy
flavors
this
might
not
be
for
you
if
you
do
youll
enjoy
this
colorado
brew
thin
in
body
but
has
a
pleasant
hop
bite
slightly
metallic
for
a
moment
but
finishes
clean
nice
overall
crispness
i
can
see
this
being
outstanding
on
a
summer
day
this
one
grows
on
you
as
well
highly
quaffable
even
for
the
style
like
i
said
this
stuff
is
caserace
worthy
id
call
it
the
best
light
beer
id
ever
had
if
it
was
indeed
intended
as
such
i
could
easily
drink
twelve
of
these
and
be
good
to
take
a
final
exam
so
drinkabilitys
its
strong
point
but
unfortunately
thats
about
it
cloudy
yellow
color
smells
like
crap
spoken
by
my
wife
not
sure
that
this
beer
really
works
for
my
tastes
very
bitter
aftertaste
doesnt
feel
great
in
my
mouth
this
will
likely
be
my
only
little
yella
pils
i
better
go
get
another
mystery
beer
to
wash
this
down
d
scores
a
few
extra
points
on
drinkability
would
be
a
good
warm
weather
beer
could
put
back
a
couple
pretty
easy
starts
better
than
it
finishes
but
is
drinkable
and
would
really
enjoy
a
couple
on
a
warm
evening
definitely
drink
cold
definitely
not
worth
the
money
would
be
easier
to
swallow
at
a
lower
price
point
poured
from
a
can
into
a
sa
pint
glass

and
a
half
finger

bubbles
kind
of
detract
from
the
appearance
school

yellow
slightly

smells
a
bit

musty
and
a
touch
of

mildly
malty
sweet

with
a
slightly
metallic
lingering
dry
finish
low
carbing

i
could
only
handle
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
i
love
the
can

and
appreciate
the
date
on
the
bottom
2
10
for
a
single
d
as
high
as
it
gets
crisp
and
refreshing
body
very
flavorful
yet
reserved
great
aftertaste
that
is
clean
and
unobtrusive
this
would
make
a
fantastic
session
beer
high
drinkability
this
went
down
very
easy
and
was
quite
smooth
a
session
beer
if
you
like
basic
beer
taste
drinkability
easily
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
while
it
is
tasty
it
lacks
the
depth
and
strength
of
flavor
of
a
true
czech
pilsner
still
a
nice
beer
though
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
a
good
beer
to
have
around
for
hot
summer
days
and
this
could
be
a
nice
beer
to
convert

not

wish

ill
still
buy
em
at
the
current

into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
subtle
bitter
hops
and
grain
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grains
and
very
light
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
easy
drinking
brew
had
a
nice
flavor
but
the
aroma
was
pretty
weak
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
gateway
brew
to
get
into
the
craft
beer
world
and
is
still
good
enough
to
enjoy
even
when
you
are
in
it
d
a
enjoyable
affordable
session
beer
overall
impression
this
would
rocket
to
the
top
of
my
rankings
of
adjunct
lagers
but
as
a
pilsner
its
very
disappointing
mama
needs
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
drinks
nicely
even
on
a
cold
december
day
watching
the
vikes
probably
be
pretty
darn
nice
very
cold
and
fresher
mid
summer
pours
a
pretty
hazed
orange
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
rim
of
residual
lacing
smells
of
orangelemon
zest
wheat
and
a
little
grassy

tastes
much
the
same
with
tons
of
orange
lemon
notes
wheat
and
plenty
of
good
hops
to
round
out
a
nice
little
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
carbonation
is
mild
drinkability
is
high
czech
pilsner
and
my
least
favorite
of
the
brews
i
tried
im
not
sure
if
its
because
it
was
the
last
one
i
tasted
or
if
i
am
becoming
too
much
of
a
hophead
but
this
beer
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
it
was
a
nice
bright
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
visible
carbonation
and
carried
a
great
thick
creamy
head
with
good
retention
but
after
that
it
just
went
downhill
like
the
troublette
under
my
nose
it
came
across
medicinally
sweet
but
with
a
faint
and
bitter
powdered
sugar
cornbanana
bread
malt
tint
oh
yeah
there
was
some
yeast
in
there
too
weird
i
know
the
mouthfeel
was
definitely
on
the
thicker
side
with
a
lighter
flavor
basically
all
sweet
cornbread
malt
than
the
nose
i
really
wish
i
had
more
to
end
on
but
thats
about
as
good
as
its
going
to
get
for
tonight
im
glad
for
the
experience
as
always
but
this
one
would
be
my
last
choice
at
any
bar
cloudy
pale
yellow
brew
gives

of

with
a

lemon
pith
and
earthy
grass
hop
with
a
bit
of
metallic
twang
taste
is
similar
but
the
citrus
aspects
are
complete
and
rounded
both
the
sweet
and
bitter
aspects
of
orange
and
lemon
secondary
notes
of

tiny
bit

a
bit
of
yeasty

smooth
and
mild
tasty
and
chuggable
had
a
can
of
this
at
animal
restaurant
in
los
angeles
pours
a
straw
yellow
colour
with
nice
white
head
smells
of
earthy
and
grassy
hops
but
more
grassy
than
anything
some
bready
malt
too
flavour
has
a
nice
kick
of
refreshing
bitterness
but
pretty
tame
given
i
was
expecting
a
bit
closer
to
a
prima
pils
from
this
brewery
nice
carbonation
level
and
a
good
beer
overall
a
two
finger
head
of
soap
suds
from
the
pour
head
went
south
in
a
hurry
leaving
a
wispy
lace
that
has
little
clinging
power
the
color
is
3
on
the
srm
chart
i
smell
the
aroma
of
orange
lime
lemon
some
malt
and
weirdly
banana
taste
is
close
to
the
smell
lots
of
citrus
flavor
some
cereal
grains
and
an
goodly
amount
of
hops
about
an
average
feeling
in
my
mouth
not
real
heavy
but
not
water
either
this
is
a
change
from
some
of
the
heavier
beers
i
have
had
lately
good
flavor
for
what
there
is
not
really
well
balanced
but
good
for
me
i
would
try
this
again
if
i
get
the
chance
a
bit
pricey
for
a
pilsner
but
its
put
together
pretty
well
not
my
goto
for
this
style
but
definitely
worth
giving
a
shot
this
is
a
solid
pilsener
and
i
love
a
nice
refreshing
pils
spicy
and
straight
to
the
point
although
technically
pikeland
pils
by
sly
fox
is
a
german
pilsener
i
think
that
one
is
a
much
better
beer
d
too
easy
to
drink
watery
very
light
d
very
flexible
beer
tastes
great
sipping
and
goes
down
easy
d
this
isnt
bad
i
might
make
it
a
golf
course
beer
at
least
pours
a
clear
yellow
straw
color
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
have
the
longest
retention
nose
is
slight
hops
and
a
bit
of
grain
not
too
much
involved
the
taste
is
slightly
grassy
and
grainy
with
a
bit
of
light
hopping
light
and
crisp
drinking
well
but
not
with
all
that
much
flavor
d
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
very
easy
to
slug
down
slightly
hazy
definitively
yella
saucy
lace
the
lil
yella
fella
has
a
sweet
malt
and
earth
aroma
slight
spice
and
pine
hop
to
it
starts
with
a
quick
kidney
punch
of
bitter
which
lasts
fading
to
what
i
do
believe
to
be
a
nice
saaz
spiciness
nice
and
sharp
up
front
with
a
wellbalanced
malt
profile
finishing
dry
i
like
drinkability
is
soso
its
not
repulsive
or
undrinkable
i
just
dont
find
it
to
be
all
that
good
as
the
glass
wears
on
the
aftertaste
is
compounded
becoming
less
enjoyable
dnice
drinking
beer
that
i
would
have
again
but
not
one
of
the
best
pils
out
there
by
a
long
shot
d
no
problem
drinking
this
can
and
perhaps
man
others
but
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
pils
i
reach
for
d
good
drinkability
i
could
easily
see
myself
going
through
a
6pack
of
these
the
sweetness
isnt
too
much
to
keep
going
back
for
more
and
the
abv
is
perfect
for
a
session
beer
note
canned
on
62210
light
bodied
lightly
carbonated
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
a
nice
tasting
beer
but
not
a
traditional
pilsener
overall
this
beer
is
balanced
and
sweet
but
for
a
craft
pils
nothing
really
stands
out
unfortunately
my
expectations
were
raised
by
oskar
declaring
their
gold
medal
award
on
the
can
what
award
who
cares
this
kind
of
marketing
unnecessarily
raises
expectations
if
this
won
any
award
that
i
actually
care
about
i
expect
to
be
blown
away
and
i
wasnt
here
its
still
not
a
bad
beer
though
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
and
yella
indeed
the
body
is
clear
yellow
with
about
a
finger
of
creamy
white
head
the
smell
is
pilsner
malts
and
grains
a
hint
of
lemon
dances
around
my
nostrils
in
to
complement
a
slightly
bitter
finish
nice
hop
balance
on
this
to
compliment
a
floral
taste
with
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
to
finish
and
boy
do
i
love
the
pilsner
malts
on
this
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
and
light
and
the
carbonation
is
really
nice
great
beer
to
enjoy
reminds
me
of
simpler
beer
times
for
me
maybe
its
the
can
anyhow
this
is
well
done
and
not
one
to
shake
a
stick
at
d
light
body
and
somewhat
refreshing
though
falls
apart
a
bit
due
to
lack
of
carbonation
mfd
pretty
crisp
and
light
on
the
tongue
and
exceptionally
sessionable
perfect
for
a
day
at
the
pool
a
verygood
pils
but
not
in
the
top
of
the
catagory
nowhere
near
prima
or
sunshine
for
a
craft
pilsner
this
is
only
middleoftheroad
with
the
aroma
and
flavor
both
being
pretty
weak
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
nice
i
like
the
creaminess
that
the
co2
lends
to
all
the
oskar
blues
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
medium
body
and
sweet
finish
overall
this
is
drinkable
and
leagues
above
any
bmc
product
its
just
nothing
that
great
drop
the
dmc
and
get
some
more
spice
from
the
saaz
and
this
would
be
great
overall
decent
beer
overall
but
not
up
to
oskar
blues
normal
quality
there
are
better
options
out
there
d
this
was
a
very
crisp
summer
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
but
still
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
had
a
fine
example
of
the
style
but
not
as
good
as
many
such
as
victory
prima
pills
mamas
little
yella
pils
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
oskar
blues
lineup
obviously
has
more
taste
than
the
macro
style
pilsners
but
still
lacking
in
the
flavors
and
aromas
i
would
expect
from
the
style
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
on
a
regular
occassion
but
would
also
never
turn
one
down
good
drinkability
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
at
the
beach
drinkability
is
good
nothing
holding
this
beer
back
here
it
is
ok
to
be
a
session
beer
and
by
all
means
it
is
even
better
than
the
very
best
bmc
lager
that
has
no
taste
something
in
the
taste
hurts
drinkability
for
me
although
i
could
still
have
a
few
in
a
row
its
not
as
drinkable
as
i
expect
a
pilsner
to
be
drinkability
sure
goes
down
easy
d
highly
drinkable
but
not
quite
as
scrumptious
as
the
best
examples
of
the
style
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
unfortunately
i
am
not
blown
away
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
one
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
quite
a
bit
better
on
tap
than
in
the
can
still
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
one
had
a
lively
carbonation
that
makes
it
really
smooth
and
a
medium
body
i
did
not
enjoy
this
i
bought
a
growler
had
a
glass
and
a
half
a
dumped
the
rest
to
just
like
drinking
a
main
macro
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
saaz
hops
and
a
hint
of
citrus
in
the
taste
sweet
malt
and
a
citrus
hint
a
smooth
and
small
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
citrusy
aftertaste
nice
pils
clean
and
fresh
nice
citrus
hint
all
the
way
through
this
is
a
delicious
and
refresing
pilsener
not
as
bitter
as
other
pilsners
ive
had
but
very
drinkable
picked
up
a
single
to
try
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
nice
floral
hop
flavor
balanced
with
a
nice
sweetness
if
this
was
a
little
lower
priced
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
overall
a
competent
pilsner
on
par
with
its
czech
competitors
its
balance
may
be
its
undoing
as
its
very
unassuming
and
as
such
a
bit
forgettable
and
at
9
49
for
a
pack
four
cans
on
a
par
with
obs
other
brews
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
in
favor
of
one
of
the
wide
array
of
readily
available
and
less
expensive
alternatives
such
as
pilsner
urquell
or
staropramen
i
must
say
im
a
bit
disappointed
at
the
latest
offering
from
oskar
blues
that
ive
tasted
perhaps
if
mine
had
been
priced
lower
i
would
think
differently
md
medium
bodied
and
good
carbonation
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
an
excellent
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
makes
this
beer
pleasant
and
excellent
to
drink
a
nice
refreshing
beer
makes
it
especially
welcome
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
in
the
90s
here
today
this
would
also
make
a
good
transition
beer
for
people
new
to
craft
beers
while
ive
had
more
that
one
of
these
in
this
sitting
im
not
about
to
rush
out
and
buy
more
if
offered
one
as
a
guest
id
be
happy
to
have
it
but
ill
not
be
adding
this
one
to
my
shopping
list
a
light
sweet
body
that
through
me
off
as
i
was
expecting
a
more
dry
pils
malt
driven
beer
instead
it
is
a
little
thicker
for
a
pils
and
has
some
good
sweetness
and
finishes
crisp
and
clean
but
not
overly
dry
for
a
canned
beer
this
is
very
enjoyable
no
bold
inyourface
macho
american
interpretation
here
just
good
clean
czechstyle
pilsener
goodness
wrapped
in
aluminum
casing
if
oskar
blues
had
the
resources
of
any
of
the
big
three
mamas
little
yella
pils
would
fit
comfortably
in
an
18pack
at
eye
level
at
any
walmart
and
would
probably
sell
twice
as
fast
as
anything
already
there

around

after

d
this
beer
seemed

not

for
again
overall
this
is
a

certainly
worth
trying
and
could
be
used
as
a

brew
into
the
world
of

might

this
is
another
nice
session
beer
that
would
play
well
at
a
tailgate
tom
and
analise
i
have
realized
by
doing
this
review
that
i
do
not
like
the
pilsner
style
it
is
a
style
which
to
me
is
not
bad
but
nothing
stands
out
about
it
either
i
will
keep
trying
them
from
time
to
time
though
in
hopes
of
finding
the
one
that
i
like
this
is
a
style
im
warming
up
to
just
had
to
refine
my
palette
the
mouth
was
thin
and
lacking
carbonation
didnt
care
for
the
feel
at
all
flavor
was
tart
and
grassy
plenty
of
lemon
zest
in
there
finishes
mild
hops
at
the
forefront
but
tamer
than
expected
not
bad
refreshing
but
needs
some
work
pours
a
clear
goldish
yellow
thin
and
fizzy
white
head
forms
quickly
settles
itself
down
to
a
medium
ring
around
the
glass
some
lace
chunks
end
up
sticking
smell
is
nice
very
lemony
some
tart
citrus
notes
honey
very
grassy
and
herbal
soft
aroma
very
delicate
but
very
refined
floral
toast
a
bit
acidic
but
nice
taste
is
very
nice
grainy
and
tart
up
front
citrus
honey
toast
nice
floral
only
a
touch
of
banana
and
vanilla
nice
herbal
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
stuff
lacking
in
flavour
and
aroma
somewhat
but
is
a
big
step
up
from
most
d
good
drinkablity
for
a
can
beer
but
an
unbalanced
taste
pushes
you
elsewhere
i
love
these
canned
brews
d
drinkable
yes
but
hard
to
compare
to
other
pils
when
i
want
a
pils
im
interested
in
the
clean
fully
carbonated
type
rather
than
a
style
with
a
little
more
umph
like
this
if
you
gave
me
the
choice
between
this
insead
of
bmc
lite
id
take
it
but
not
over
a
true
german
pils
this
isnt
half
bad
but
there
are
many
better
pils
brewed
by
american
breweries
in
cans
even
sly
fox
decent
md
appropriately
thin
body
for
the
style
but
not
watery
somewhat
silky
easy
to
drink
and
very
much
a
starter
beer
for
someone
who
might
be
interested
in
craft
beer
but
is
scared
of
color
i
dig
the
can
thing
but
i
swear
my
first
sip
or
two
i
get
metal
id
need
blind
taste
test
to
be
sure
this
brew
has
a
lightly
sweet
malt
base
with
just
a
little
more
than
a
kiss
of
the
hops
bitter
hops
come
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
to
remind
me
that
this
isnt
just
another
bmc
pilsener
but
something
better
that
being
said
this
isnt
outstanding
there
could
be
more
hops
for
the
price
i
paid
and
the
aftertaste
still
sits
on
my
tongue
like
all
those
bmcs
the
mouth
feel
is
thicker
and
delivers
more
flavor
and
this
is
good
but
with
victory
prima
around
it
doesnt
quite
stack
up
like
i
hoped
it
would
flavors
are
slightly
grainy
malt
quality
on
the
darker
side
of
yellow
but
somewhat
hazy
muted
aromasomewhat
sulfur
like
and
earthyjust
not
much
there
sweet
malt
flavor
with
just
a
zing
of
hop
bitterness
lingering
metalcoppery
flavor
finish
is
somewhat
sweet
decent
enough
mouthfeel
overall
rather
average
i
was
expecting
more
could
be
cleaner
and
crisper
for
my
liking
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
perfect
for
summertime
is
great
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
in
winter
either
12oz
poured
transparent
yellow
and
was
topped
with
a
white
head
aromas
smelled
like
a
pilsener
malty
grassy
with
some
mild
hops
and
slight
lemony
citrus
tastes
were
boldly
pilsenerlike
herbal
hops
on
the
finish
with
a
slight
lemon
again
finishes
moire
bitter
than
expected
and
seemed
to
cause
some
problems
with
the
balance
and
overall
drinkability
i
wasnt
crazy
over
this
one
and
wouldnt
get
it
again
drinkability
not
bad
was
ok
good
beer
but
not
my
choice
of
style
though
d
this
is
a
decent
pilsener
and
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
really
shined
for
me
it
wasnt
amazing
but
its
well
worth
the
try
mouthfeel
pretty
fucking
ace
drinkability
i
dont
think
you
can
get
any
more
perfect
than
this
beer
its
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
all
day
and
all
morning
very
light
and
refreshing
would
make
a
great
session
or
summer
beer
the
taste
is
mostly
grain
up
front
a
little
dough
with
lemon
rind
grass
hints
of
herbs
spicy
hops
some
hay
it
has
a
little
lightly
spicy
bitterlemon
hop
bitterness
but
this
is
solid
and
lingers
along
with
a
mostly
nice
zestiness
it
has
light
malty
sweetness
underneath
with
sweet
grain
that
lingers
after
the
finish
with
light
spiceypeppery
bitterness
it
is
just
slightly
on
the
bitter
tart
and
astringent
side
and
is
not
as
good
with
food
but
overall
its
a
solid
characterful
pilsnertype
however
it
ends
up
being
rather
thin
and
two
dimensional
lemonyspicy
old
dough
nothing
special
but
a
decent
canned
pilsner
overall
not
much
happening
wthis
one
definitely
one
of
the
worst
pilseners
ive
had
from
a
good
brewery
didnt
finish
even
though
bland
and
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
from
a
good
brewer
i
think
it
would
have
a
much
lower
average
rating
drinks
pretty
easy
not
quite
as
good
as
the
draft
version
but
a
near
firstrate
pils
in
a
can
offering
imo
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
elite
american
brewed
pilsners
i
like
it
a
bit
more
than
victorys
prima
this
is
not
undrinkable
but
certainly
not
what
a
pilsner
should
be
this
is
a
totally
drinkable
smooth
beer
its
like
bmc
done
better
but
nothing
spectacular
clean
golden
straw
body
pinkie
finger
of
gauzy
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
in
the
pint
glass
honeyish
grain
malts
freshmowed
grass
and
some
noble
herbal
hops
mineral
water
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
faintly
sweet
toasted
bread
malts
snappy
peppery
hop
bitterness
bites
in
a
little
taste
of
sea
air
into
the
finish
lightbodied
with
refreshing
lively
carbonation
easydrinking
and
nicely
made
pours
clear
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
has
grassy
malts
citrus
hops
and
herbal
yeast
taste
is
quite
grainy
with
a
mellow
hop
presence
light
body
is
a
bit
under
carbonted
and
finishes
thin
refreshing
beer
but
not
on
the
same
level
as
their
other
cans
tastes
very
crisp
slightly
malty
with
a
strong
hops
bite
up
front
and
an
almost
creamy
finish
definetely
one
of
the
better
american
pilsners
and
the
fact
that
it
is
in
a
can
is
a
definite
plus
it
even
tastes
great
straight
from
the
can
d
pretty
darn
good
beer
especially
for
a
hot
day
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
also
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
get
someone
to
try
who
only
drinks
bmc
nice
summertime
beer
to
drink
after
a
long
day
out
in
the
sun
d
i
will
revisit
as
ob
seem
to
have
addressed
the
dms
problems
i
remember
the
first
couple
of
cans
i
had
of
this
beer
having
well
done
accessible
czech
pils
with
a
german
touch
this
is
a
great
pool
beer
for
the
summer
before
recently
you
had
to
buy
some
inexpensive
domestic
beer
to
take
places
that
do
not
permit
glass
containers
in
my
experience
this
led
to
me
drinking
the
afternoon
away
on
something
that
did
not
taste
very
good
and
left
me
regretting
my
beverage
decision
thank
god
the
oskar
blues
brewery
in
lyons
co
produce
a
number
of
great
beers
in
the
pool
friendly
aluminum
cans
this
delicious
czech
style
pilsner
is
made
with
hearty
amount
of
pale
malt
german
specialty
malts
and
traditional
saaz
and
21st
century
bavarian
hops
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
show
the
world
that
not
all
american
made
pilsners
are
water
downed
flavorless
beers
that
flood
the
shelves
here
in
the
u
s
d
easily
drinkable
for
beer
lovers
and
novices
alike
good
first
step
for
a
person
new
to
good
beer
perhaps
not
a
real
classic
pils
as
found
in
the
njpa
area
but
easy
to
have
a
few
on
a
hot
day
and
a
few
more
tomorrow
overall
this
is
an
excellent
amer
adjuct
lager
and
just
a
soso
chez
pils
either
way
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
drinkability
its
stupidly
drinkable
this
is
the
real
deal
and
something
that
would
probably
put
off
drinkers
of
bland
corporate
u
s
pilsners
as
it
actually
has
flavor
and
character
mamas
little
yella
pils
gives
a
good
name
to
canned
u
s
pilsners
about
time
notes
for
less
money
ill
be
sticking
with
sly
fox
pikeland
pils
if
i
want
a
pilsner
in
a
can
or
troegs
or
victory
for
this
style
doesnt
do
it
for
me
esp
at
almost
11
for
a
sixer
this
brew
pours
with
a
frothy
white
head
and
a
deep
straw
color
that
is
atypical
for
style
slightly
cloudy
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
floral
hops
but
theres
a
nice
bready
malt
grainy
undercurrent
there
as
well
floral
hops
are
highlighted
in
the
taste
more
taste
than
outright
bitterness
and
the
finish
comes
across
sweet
d
this
is
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
not
bursting
with
flavor
but
the
subtleties
are
what
make
this
beer
solid
sort
of
glad
i
avoided
picking
up
a
4pack
in
the
stores
but
still
glad
i
tried
this
brew
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
summer
part
outdoors
or
for
a
light
bbq
sauce
pairing
oskar
blues
continues
to
deliver
better
than
hoped
for
on
most
occasions
drinkability
its
approachable
enough
that
i
guarantee
my
macro
friends
would
enjoy
this
but
crafty
enough
that
my
pretentious
ass
liked
it
i
definitely
have
a
new
brew
when
i
hit
the
hot
springs
next
time
i
visit
boise
sorry
old
chub
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
nice
d
refreshing
and
light
good
warm
weather
beer
is
easy
drinking
taste
does
not
entirely
repel
nor
invite
me
for
another
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
6
more
p
s
cans
rule
for
good
fresh
tasting
packaged
beer
i
have
yet
to
have
a
sub
par
beer
from
oskar
blues
in
my
book
consistent
quality
is
one
of
the
key
differentiating
factors
for
a
superior
craft
brewery
which
these
guys
have
it
nailed
i
believe
that
the
czech
pilsner
is
a
severely
underrated
style
of
beer
and
oskar
blues
provides
a
great
representation
my
knowledge
of
lagers
is
spotty
at
best
so
i
dont
really
want
to
be
harsh
here
that
said
its
not
a
huge
improvement
from
a
standard
macro
lager
its
certainly
better
but
having
had
a
really
great
pilsener
moonlight
reality
czeck
i
can
at
least
say
that
the
style
can
be
done
better
this
beer
is
too
sweet
lacks
hop
aroma
and
flavor
and
fails
to
justify
its
relatively
high
price
tag
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
sour
mash
offflavor
that
marks
the
vast
majority
of
macro
lagers
as
being
of
inferior
quality
also
my
score
would
probably
shoot
up
significantly
if
the
hops
were
increased
my
biggest
problem
is
that
the
simple
sugary
malt
flavor
isnt
counterbalanced
properly
and
just
makes
me
think
of
the
taste
of
pale
malt
extract
i
love
when
american
craft
breweries
take
on
lager
styles
but
lagers
seem
to
need
a
whole
lot
of
tinkering
to
achieve
a
perfect
balance
of
flavors
so
i
hope
oskar
blues
keeps
at
it
and
just
makes
some
adjustments
d
decent
i
think
id
have
another
drinkability
pretty
high
even
though
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
is
a
pretty
solid
representation
of
what
one
should
be
its
refreshing
and
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
and
the
abv
is
pretty
small
so
i
dont
think
youd
have
to
be
too
worried
about
being
trashed
if
you
endulged
in
two
or
three
i
brought
back
this
beer
and
others
from
atlanta
several
months
ago
apparently
anticipation
didnt
take
hold
until
tonight
when
i
saw
it
behind
several
other
beers
in
the
refrigerator
the
beer
is
clear
and
golden
colored
and
despite
foam
spurting
out
when
i
popped
the
cap
there
was
a
very
thin
head
in
the
pint
glass
the
smell
is
subdued
very
neutral
in
that
both
malt
and
hops
are
detected
but
seem
turned
to
about
2
on
the
aromadial
the
taste
is
surprisingly
good
compared
with
the
nose
sweet
pale
malts
primarily
but
with
saaz
hops
providing
a
comfortable
level
of
bitterness
it
tastes
european
this
is
high
praise
strongly
carbonated
so
much
so
it
tickles
when
swallowed
definitely
a
good
backyard
beer
or
baseball
beer
easy
for
summertime
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
pils
thats
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
great
after
mowing
the
yard
d
the
flavor
just
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
plus
theres
that
strange
metallicsour
aspect
to
it
but
the
mouthfeel
and
low
alcohol
would
have
made
this
an
excellent
session
beer
had
the
flavor
come
around
overall
a
very
balanced
and
mild
beer
from
a
brewery
that
specializes
in
heavy
and
more
extreme
beers
great
lawnmower
beach
gateway
or
simply
outdoor
beer
good
beer
altogether
shore
test
this
or
ten
fidy
at
the
beach
this
hell
yeah
pours
out
strawgold
with
a
decent
enough
white
head
smells
very
malty
almost
caramel
good
overriding
malt
flavor
didnt
know
a
pilsner
could
taste
this
good
has
a
little
hop
bitterness
on
back
of
tongue
i
found
this
to
be
a
great
pilsner
and
worthy
of
a
repurchase
okay
im
on
board
with
the
craft
brew
in
a
can
thing
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
and
will
happily
tote
it
off
to
places
and
events
where
bottles
just
wont
do
good
stuff
d
a
good
summer
beer
but
there
are
a
few
other
examples
of
the
style
out
there
that
id
prefer
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
perhaps
this
beer
could
use
an
increase
in
crispness
which
would
make
it
little
more
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
is
hindered
by
the
lack
of
flavor
in
this
brew
having
said
that
i
did
down
two
cans
in
pretty
short
order
so
ill
go
with
average
on
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
gold
color
the
head
is
a
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
a
moderate
ring
of
lacing
not
bad
for
a
pils
the
aroma
is
of
toast
malt
and
plenty
of
spicy
and
floral
hops
it
is
very
balanced
yet
vibrant
at
the
same
time
the
taste
is
more
on
the
malty
side
with
a
big
toasty
lightly
carmely
bit
and
balancing
hops
in
the
background
it
isnt
as
crisp
as
one
might
expect
from
a
pilsener
but
it
works
nonetheless
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
might
not
be
the
best
pilsener
out
there
but
it
is
certainly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
too
overall
a
pretty
decent
pils
good
to
see
another
example
available
in
my
area
i
would
try
it
again
extra
points
for
being
able
to
find
this
in
cans
not
a
fan
of
all
their
beers
not
big
on
the
dales
and
chub
but
this
one
belongs
up
there
with
the
outstanding
gordons
an
top
ten
ten
fidy
the
feel
is
bubbly
and
yet
watery
an
unusual
bitter
burn
on
the
way
down
a
pretty
average
pils
really
not
bad
just
kinda
dull
overall
a
great

beersummer
slammer
tastes
fine
and
comes
in
a
can
pretty
damn
ideal
if
given
this
in
a
blind
tasting
i
probably
would
have
guessed
it
was
a
helles
lager
but
that
being
said
its
a
good
sessionable
yellow
beer
that
actually
has
some
good
flavor
to
it
recommended
for
scenarios
that
call
for
it
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
hue
to
darken
things
up
a
bit
head
quickly
reduces
to
a
bit
of
lace
smell
is
faint
but
grassy
hops
come
through
maybe
a
bit
of
butter
in
the
smell
too
taste
is
simple
clean
a
shrpt
bitterness
followed
by
the
malt
and
bitterness
again
coming
through
the
clean
finish
a
bit
fizzy
in
the
mouthfeel
but
still

not

well
done
pilsners
are
not
exactly
my
style
of
choice
which
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
really
review
them
but
this
one
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
tried
mamas
little
yella
pils
isnt
at
all
what
i
expected
the
name
is
pretty
cool
but
this
is
really
one
of
the
best
american
pale
lagers
on
the
face
of
the
earth
what
the
hell
it
deserves
a
higher

no
matter
what

12
oz

minimal

quite
a

throughout

nearly
nonexistent
a

just
a
little
more
potent
than
the
aroma
some
maltiness
just
a
little
grass
citrus
and
pine
a
bit
thin
even
for
a
pilsener
i
guess
you
could
call
this
their
session
beer
very
inoffensive
just
very
bland
definetely
not
the
best
from
oskar
appears
a
bright
brillian
golden
crystal
clear
filtered
out
completely
large
white
head
slowly
dwindles
i
had
it
on
tap
last
week
and
so
far
im
thinking
the
can
hurt
this
beer
theres
almost
no
hop
character
in
the
nose
just
a
bit
of
grainy
sweetness
blended
with
subtle
lemon
and
herb
accents
very
weak
and
non
pronounced
take
a
page
from
sly
fox
if
your
going
to
can
a
pils
do
it
right
this
is
no
czech
or
german
pils
it
seems
like
an
american
macro
flavor
is
just
a
blend
of
mild
sweetness
some
cooked
veggie
with
stale
hop
character
barely
has
any
bitterness
just
focuses
on
the
yellow
fizzy
beer
flavors
it
does
nothing
to
set
itself
apart
i
love
their
other
canned
offernigs
but
this
one
strikes
out
mouthfeel
is
light
and
mildly
fizzy
in
the
carbonation
department
not
much
to
speak
about
drinkability
overall
is
pour
gimme
some
dales
pale
i
need
some
flavor
like
i
said
way
more
hop
flavor
when
i
had
it
on
tap
last
week
this
one
is
a
microbrewed
pre
prohibition
pils
give
it
a
try
if
your
into
strohs
d
a
disappointing
effort
from
oskar
blues
not
a
great
pils
by
any
stretch
dnice
beer
for
those
looking
for
a
thirst
quencher
but
doesnt
do
much
to
stand
out
from
the
pack
pours
a
bright
yellow
fizzy
with
a
loose
white
head
smell
is
generic
and
malty
with
hints
of
noble
hops
taste
is
very
ineresting
and
full
of
malty
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
is
good
id
like
to
try
this
with
a
barbeque
or
some
mexican
food
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
a
tasty
summer
refresher
with
plenty
of
flavor
light
body
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
its
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
a
standout
d
not
that
high
im
not
an
expert
in
the
style
but
this
one
seems
like
a
pretty
poor
take
and
doesnt
offer
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
for
the
price
point
going
to
skip
in
the
future
cheers
i
have
really
liked
the
oskar
blues
offerings
i
have
had
in
the
pastthis
eh
poured
from
the
can
into
a
pilsner
a
lighter
yellow
with
a
nice
fluffy
craterous
white
head
that
left
broken
lace
as
it
settled
fiant
wet
grain
in
the
nose
along
with
some
sweet
doughthis
is
a
sweet
pilsner
and
honestly
i
dont
think
thats
what
its
all
aboutanyways
sweet
dough
with
a
toasty
finishnot
much
hop
presence
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
its
to
sweet
and
lacks
definition
in
my
mind
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
offwhite
head
over
the
almost
clear
yellow
as
advertised
brew
dense
head
dwindles
as
bubble
by
bubble
break
with
good
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
with
citrus
tinge
to
the
hoppiness
taste
is
sweeter
than
expected
on
through
the
middle
and
then
cuts
with
moderate
prickly
hops
and
a
crisp
close
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
superb
the
sweetbitter
interplay
is
the
main
show
here
great
stuff
the
body
is
moderate
to
light
would
like
a
bit
more
complexity
and
body
carbonation
is
low
put
not
over
the
top
overall
a
nice
little
pils
but
is
missing
some
of
the
malt
backing
and
depth
that
i
am
looking
for
the
hops
are
spot
on
though
got
a
sixer
of
these
to
lounge
on
our
apartment
building
roof
in
the
sun
a
nice
pilsener
along
the
lines
of
the
prima
pils
and
troegss
pils
offering
some
grassiness
light
hops
and
then
your
general
pils
look
and
feel
meaning
not
too
great
good
for
a
nice
day
a
good
take
on
the
style
clean
balanced
nicely
carbonated
and
a
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
beer
its
easy
enough
to
drink
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
i
find
the
buttery
diacetyl
odd
though
something
that
would
be
good
at
a
bbq
or
a
hot
day
drinkability
a
solid
domestic
pils
which
is
one
of
those
styles
thats
tough
for
breweries
to
actually
brew
domestically
nice
for
the
weather
and
easydrinking
but
not
something
that
can
match
one
from
the
source
canned
040909
batch
10
enjoyed
061309
very
drinkable
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
being
in
cans
makes
them
easier
to
carry
d
very
all
i
can
say
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pils
and
that
is
what
i
want
from
the
style
easily
killed
four
of
these
with
no
regrets
it
may
have
actually
gotten
a
5
in
the
drinkability
department
but
the
10
price
tag
takes
a
little
away
yes
i
tend
to
factor
in
price
to
this
score
otherwise
i
cant
complain
just
a
great
summerlawnmower
brew
refreshes
and
pleases
thank
you
oskar
blues
very
nice
a
nice
drinkable
pilsner
but
nothing
special
i
can
see
why
this
would
be
a
nice
option
when
a
can
is
required
but
otherwise
id
shoot
for
something
different
overall
a
decent
pils
more
in
common
with
an
all
malt
macro
than
an
authentic
pils
like
all
beers
it
has
its
place
in
an
effort
to
support
small
berweries
and
to
appease
the
law
that
states
no
glass
on
a
beach
or
lake
i
will
be
purchasing
this
brew
for
these
trips
seems
more
like
a
cheaper
american
pils
not
that
great
nothing
about
this
says
czech
to
me
this
went
down
so
well
on
a
hot
florida
beach
it
was
tough
saving
a
few
to
bring
home
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
pale
color
with
better
than
a
full
finger
loose
foamy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
little
lacing
present
the
smell
is
good
but
not
fully
present
lemony
citrus
notes
and
a
good
amount
of
malt
sweetness
suggested
a
little
sweeter
that
most
in
style
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
slightly
tangy
the
flavor
is
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggests
not
as
tart
or
refreshing
as
some
of
this
style
but
very
very
drinkable
at
5
3
abv
these
would
go
all
night
long
the
total
package
seem
a
little
heavier
and
more
filling
than
my
most
recent
sample
of
this
style
d
this
is
a
nice
and
light
summer
beer
and
would
do
quite
well
at
a
bbq
or
after
chores
outside
d
an
interesting
pils
not
really
in
balance
an
american
take
for
sure
d
doesnt
reinvent
the
pilsner
which
is
a
very
good
thing
welldone
version
of
the
style
and
ohsodrinkable
after
4
hours
of
yardwork
id
do
this
one
again
loads
of
flavor
very
nice
look
another
fine
effort
by
oskar
blues
dumb
name
but
then
again
so
are
old
chub
ten
fidy
or
gordon
but
who
cares
when
they
taste
this
good
a
great
sipping
brewnot
the
worlds
most
amazing
pilsner
probably
but
a
very
good
one
at
that
drinkability
a
pretty
good
czech
pilsner
but
overall
nothing
special
id
reach
for
a
sierra
nevada
summerfest
over
this
one
in
a
heartbeat
d
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
drinks
quickly
and
soothingly
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
give
any
friends
that
need
weening
off
the
typical
macro
beers
drinkability
despite
the
drawbacks
its
quite
drinkable
it
just
isnt
really
a
pils
in
my
mind
kick
up
the
noble
hops
and
the
drinkability
score
jumps
up
as
well
while
not
a
bad
beer
it
could
stand
some
improvement
in
hop
taste
or
at
least
be
more
noticeable
in
the
aroma
living
in
se
pa
this
is
one
style
czech
or
german
pils
where
i
can
find
at
least
1
cz
a
half
dozen
local
german
pils
that
are
an
improvement
over
this
so
i
dont
think
i
will
be
buying
this
again
this
beer
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
there
just
isnt
a
whole
lot
going
on
i
could
forgive
this
beer
for
not
being
a
true
pilsner
if
it
at
least
had
something
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
that
kept
me
interested
but
it
gave
up
the
great
things
about
a
pilsner
and
put
nothing
in
its
place
md
light
bodied
prickly
on
the
tongue
but
not
overly
so
drinkability
is
decent
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
and
very
simple
but
nice
to
have
another
option
in
can
form
that
does
offer
more
than
the
normal
bmc
fare

very
easy
drinking
on
a

day
perfect
for
a
round
of

smooth
crisp
very
chuggable
a
real
pilsner
you
can
drink
proudly
straight
from
the
can
maybe
a
beer
you
can
convert
your
macrodrinking
friends
with
d
not
my
favorite
pils
but
quite
easy
to
drink
with
a
low
abv
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
looks
slightly
cloudy
for
a
pils
but
otherwise
its
very
pretty
deep
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
behind
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
slightly
sweet
very
grainy
and
a
little
citrusy
like
lemongrass
or
something
drinks
easy
light
enough
in
body
to
to
have
4
or
5
and
flavorful
enough
to
want
another
after
youre
done
not
too
much
bitterness
but
enough
to
clean
up
the
mild
sweetness
and
the
pale
malty
flavors
had
this
straight
from
the
can
yesterday
at
an
outdoor
concert
and
it
was
almost
as
good
that
way
all
around
a
good
albeit
a
little
pricey
pils
first
off
they
shorted
me
about
a
ounce
and
a
half
weird
poured
clear
and
golden
soft
fluffy
white
head
malty
aroma
the
slightest
hop
aroma
as
well
a
slight
funk
taste
very
much
like
a
brewpub
pilsner
buttery
not
sharp
enough
the
crisp
flavor
is
not
there
medium
bodied
soft
although
the
flavor
is
not
what
i
expected
or
prefer
it
is
quite
drinkable
overall
decent
a
nice
pilsner
to
have
in
a
can
d
this
beer
was
ok
to
me
but
not
my
favorite
take
on
this
style
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
good
summer
beer
the
cans
make
it
easy
to
take
on
a
hike
while
not
the
best
looking
or
most
adventurous
beer
style
to
try
this
was
one
solid
beer
pours
a
slightly
seethrough
golden
color
nice
little
head
to
it
with
some
ascending
bubbles
not
much
there
for
aroma
but
not
bad
smelling
at
all
taste
is
medium
bodied
and
nice
and
crisp
get
a
nice
spicy
bite
to
it
along
with
some
buttery
tasting
notes
probably
one
of
the
better
pilseners
ive
gotten
to
try
out
nothing
too
exciting
but
a
great
beer
to
wind
down
the
work
week
with
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
twofinger
creamy
white
head
with
lots
of
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
and
spice
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
hoppy
with
a
nice
spice
note
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
pils
thanks
bill
over
all
above
average
light
beer
definitely
session
able
but
too
simple
to
really
rate
it
high
over
all
a
good
offering
but
not
going
to
displace
some
european
offerings
from
my
favourite
pilsners
i
only
wish
ohio
could
get
this
stuff
because
i
always
wanted
to
have
an
all
time
pilsner
in
my
fridge
this
funky
little
beer
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
poured
out
of
its
cool
little
can
into
a
roughly
foot
tall
pilsner
glass
and
released
a
head
with
rather
large
bubbles
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
nor
did
they
leave
a
lasting
lace
the
aromas
are
of
noble
earthy
noble
hops
come
horse
blanket
mustyness
and
haystraw
the
perfect
grain
flavor
comes
through
on
the
first
sip
along
with
the
background
of
hops
there
has
to
be
some
carapils
malt
in
this
its
rather
sweet
the
mouth
feel
lends
perfectly
to
the
style
of
this
beer
its
light
brightly
carbonated
and
sharp
bubbles
smooth
soft
feel
when
the
carbonation
settles
in
your
mouth
and
finishes
exceedingly
dry
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
a
great
example
of
a
classic
pilsner
slightly
sweet
and
out
of
balance
malt
is
really
cereal
driven
and
missing
on
the
hop
end
especially
in
the
middle
carbonation
level
is
light
as
well
a
bit
creamy
in
the
middle
but
could
use
more
carbo
there
carbo
does
come
into
effect
upon
the
end
and
finish
a
bit
acidic
on
the
finish
as
well
d
a
very
good
lager
the
hops
are
subdued
for
a
west
coast
pils
but
i
feel
the
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
like
the
clean
tasting
quality
and
this
pils
hits
the
spot
if
you
like
the
style
you
wont
be
dissapointed
this
would
go
great
with
sweet
grilled
sausage
or
a
good
old
fashioned
american
burger
for
summer
grilling
pours
a
shade
darker
than
most
pils
still
a
completely
clear
straw
color
the
head
was
disappointing
quite
small
and
didnt
last
long
the
aroma
is
barely
there
perhaps
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
a
bit
grassy
and
a
touch
grainy
perhaps
a
smidge
of
butter
no
real
cracker
like
malt
or
grassydry
noble
hops
basically
tastes
like
a
nonadjuncty
lager
very
neutral
flavor
probably
great
for
tailgating
light
to
moderate
body
with
less
than
crisp
carbonation
finishes
quite
neutral
drinks
outstandingly
easy
no
strong
or
odd
flavors
to
hold
any
sort
of
beer
drinker
back
this
is
a
very
boring
and
bland
pils
not
much
flavor
at
all
i
would
still
pick
it
up
for
a
day
of
drinking
at
a
bbq
or
tailgate
not
bad
not
great
is
the
best
way
to
sum
up
this
beer
i
probably
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
order
this
again
i
like
the
convenience
of
cans
but
i
would
prefer
a
sixer
of
dales
if
i
were
looking
to
drink
a
few
from
these
guys
this
pils
falls
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
hierarchy
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
some
nice
characteristics
but
just
lacking
in
flavor
not
bad
overall
very
effevecent
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
great
lake
beer
tweaked
slightly
41813
d
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
d
not
too
complex
and
i
am
a
little
conflicted
as
to
whether
or
not
i
am
enjoying
the
finish
on
this
one
not
something
i
would
drink
many
of
and
i
probably
will
not
revisit
this
d
i
scanned
some
review
scores
before
i
tasted
and
wasnt
expecting
too
much
well
i
guess
everybody
has
differing
tastes
i
like
this
beer
next
time
my
friend
invites
me
out
to
go
sailing
on
narragansett
bay
i
know
the
beer
to
bring
d
a
low
abv
pilsner
that
i
will
be
looking
for
in
the
summertime
d
not
good
matter
of
fact
i
feel
ripped
off
on
this
one
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
an
entire
growler
of
this
stuff
that
will
teach
me
to
sample
first
d
light
yet
hearty
simple
yet
complete
a
very
fulfilling
beer
for
the
style
can
poured
into
a
pint
glass
hazy
yellowgold
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
away
pretty
quickly
cereal
grain
aroma
with
bready
pilsener
malt
minor
lemony
character
flavor
is
very
crackery
and
bready
with
a
modest
pithy
citric
twang
and
a
whisper
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
fairly
crisp
with
light
body
and
nice
fine
carbonation
good
drinkability
d
very
drinkable
as
it
should
be
with
the
excellent
malt
character
and
pleasing
dryness
it
would
be
easy
to
take
down
a
whole
sixpack
during
a
long
evening
too
bad
subtlety
doesnt
get
more
respect
i
dont
drink
many
pilsners
so
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
it
poured
a
cloudy
pale
amber
with
decent
sudsy
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
i
really
could
not
smell
a
thing
it
tasted
good
extremely
well
balanced
mild
yeast
mild
citrus
but
nothing
stood
out
as
far
as
sweetness
or
bitterness
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
the
drinkability
is
high
i
could
probably
drink
a
sixpack
of
these
while
playing
frisbee
golf
or
sitting
outside
on
a
warm
day
a
good
summer
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
and
remember
when
in
dount
trust
your
bust
di
could
drink
this
all
night
long
its
so
good
please
go
out
and
get
a
sixer
if
you
havent
yet
you
will
be
rewarded
by
and
large
mamas
little
yella
pils
is
better
than
but
not
unlike
budweiser
kind
of
like
a
craft
brewery
doing
an
imitation
of
a
macrobrewery
doing
an
imitation
of
a
craft
brew
its
not
really
necessary
another
choice
brew
from
oskar
blues
d
drinkability
was
better
then
good
an
all
day
drinker
that
was
crisp
refreshing
hoppy
and
a
cant
miss
case
worthy
goes
down
effortlessly
and
packable
in
cans
makes
this
a
go
anywhere
and
drink
anytime
pilsner
this
was
a
decent
enough
pils
i
suppose
maybe
a
touch
overly
sweet
but
the
crispness
was
there
as
was
a
decent
quaffability
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
doubt
that
id
invest
in
another
sixpack
i
probably
knock
this
beer
a
bit
too
much
as
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
prima
pils
lately
and
this
one
isnt
even
in
the
same
ballpark
this
would
be
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
you
are
looking
for
a
lot
of
flavor
look
elsewhere
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
that
held
fairly
well
and
a
spotty
lace
earthy
grassy
slight
herbal
and
spice
nose
big
malt
taste
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
price
for
a
six
pak
a
little
high
i
thought
compared
to
the
imported
pilseners
i
have
had
drinkability
yes
quite
drinkable
indeed
refreshing
a
solid
pilsener
from
a
very
solid
brewery
overall
pretty
good
brew
but
nothing
overwhelming
worth
a
look
d
easy
drink
mild
flavors
but
interesting
with
a
descent
body
and
a
refreshing
amount
of
carbonation
hazy
yellow
thin
dirty
white
head
lacing
is
moderate
and
patchy
oh
this
smells
good
like
liquid
bread
like
liquid
5
grain
bread
pure
breadiness
and
crackery
malt
goodness
on
the
nose
with
a
little
flowery
hop
presence
as
well
taste
like
liquid
bread
too
bready
yeastiness
with
some
grainy
flavors
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
snappiness
crisp
but
light
bitterness
lively
carbonation
this
is
gonna
be
a
great
goto
beer
in
the
summer
for
me
this
year
d
this
beer
is
way
too
drinkable
and
would
make
a
fantastic
outdoortailgating
beer
when
the
convenience
of
cans
is
important
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
definitely
recommended
decent
beer
not
a
top
level
pils
but
a
nice
drinker
for
the
summer
as
far
as
czech
pilseners
go
this
is
pretty
average
nothing
standing
out
verdict
in
mamas
little
yella
pils
oskar
blues
have
created
a
straightforward
tasty
and
very
drinkable
pilsener
in
fact
its
one
of
the
best
pilseners
ive
tried
yet
if
youre
looking
for
a
highly
refreshing
pilsener
sold
in
a
can
this
is
certainly
the
beer
for
you
drinkability
totally
sessionable
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
style
and
have
had
mixed
results
with
this
brewery
that
being
said
this
is
my
new
standard
bearer
for
the
style
this
is
totally
refreshing
and
not
other
pilsners
i
have
had
a
lot
of
pilsners
and
as
of
right
now
this
is
the
best
i
have
had
great
beer
for
the
style
another
great
beer
from
oskar
blues
can
they
even
make
a
bad
beer
i
think
not
well
done
fellas
another
great
beer
from
oskar
blues
fullbodied
delicious
and
bold
i
like
what
they
do
up
there
in
lyons
co
the
fact
that
you
can
take
this
beer
camping
makes
it
all
the
better
really
good
stuff
amazing
head
here
dont
drink
from
the
can
since
this
one
pours
transparent
pale
golden
color
with
rocky
foamy
meringuelike
head
aromas
are
fresh
with
a
grain
malty
component
and
light
herbal
hops
on
the
palate
it
is
light
bodied
lightly
sweetmalty
and
a
good
herbal
crispness
from
the
hops
easy
drinking
a
good
attempt
at
a
hardtofind
style
pours
with
brilliant
clarity
2
fingers
of
sudsy
foam
into
a
pint
glass
it
laces
a
little
and
then
the
surface
breaks
in
the
centre
of
the
glass
a
touch
bready
and
slightly
sulfuric
grassy
noble
hop
note
towards
the
end
bready
flavor
clean
with
very
mild
hop
presence
finishes
dry
as
it
warms
there
is
a
slight
complimentary
sweetness
to
the
light
bready
malt
seemed
more
like
a
german
helles
than
czech
to
me
but
what
do
i
know
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
day
without
too
much
intellectualizing
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
really
nice
pilsener
all
of
the
flavors
are
there
and
blended
very
well
i
liked
it
a
lot
d
this
is
a
great
gateway
beer
for
the
bmc
fan
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
i
hope
that
i
can
find
it
more
often
because
this
will
be
a
great
camping
beer
excellent
beer
not
really
my
style
but
still
a
fine
beer
pretty
good
for
a
canned
micro
pilsener
easy
to
drink
and
good
for
a
romp
on
the
beach
or
while
mowing
the
lawn
d
drinkable
although
i
will
not
be
seeking
out
again
there
are
still
a
few
more
oskar
blues
that
i
need
to
try
a
light
bodied
refreshing
lager
that
fits
far
above
the
macros
well
worth
drinking
if
this
is
your
style
drinkability
easy
to
session
although
the
5
3
abv
sneaks
up
a
bit
wonderful
pils
imo
i
went
right
back
out
and
bought
the
last
six
pack
they
had
after
i
had
a
couple
of
them
da
good
macro
lager
alternative
just
enough
flavour
to
keep
from
being
boring
but
overall
a
bit
too
light
to
feel
truly
solid
resample
tap
picked
up
a
sixer
at
abes
in
bethlehem
for
around
10
canned
on
33109
im
dusting
off
one
of
my
pilsner
glasses
and
diving
in
appears
a
clear
effervescent
pale
yellow
color
with
barely
half
an
inch
of
quickly
fading
white
foam
smells
of
lightly
toasted
grains
bread
and
grass
tastes
of
bready
grains
a
bit
of
spicy
pepper
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
grassy
mildly
bitter
hops
and
a
hint
of
lemon
every
so
slightly
below
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
moderate
carbonation
the
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
during
this
late
april
mini
heat
wave
going
on
here
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
to
be
sure
it
would
make
a
good
summer
brew
although
not
a
fan
of
pilsners
perhaps
the
the
beer
gods
aligned
the
perfect
day
for
me
to
try
this
beer
again
as
i
had
a
first
and
then
another
while
i
was
outside
grilling
in
the
saun
and
90
degree
heat
cant
wait
to
get
home
and
have
another
if
i
have
this
again
it
wont
be
from
a
tap
well
i
might
want
to
drink
a
bit
more
of
this
this
summer
maybe
i
need
more
than
just
1
can
a
soft
beer
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
this
has
a
lot
of
the
elements
of
an
inexpensive
macro
grainy
a
relatively
harsh
aftertaste
that
doesnt
really
feature
much
hops
i
like
the
texturea
bit
richer
than
most
pilsners
d
if
you
are
into
paying
a
few
extra
dollars
for
a
beer
that
isnt
to
much
better
than
most
other
macros
out
there
overall
this
beer
isnt
anythign
special
at
all
i
would
recommend
trying
it
but
my
experience
wasnt
anythign
special
at
all
not
up
to
nearly
the
level
of
the
other
ob
beers
i
have
had
but
i
have
never
been
blown
away
by
a
pilsner
not
impressed
big
letdown
here
czech
pils
no
way
no
where
near
a
euro
pils
buttery
adjunct
laden
flavors
smells
absolutely
terrible
not
up
to
obs
normal
quality
was
all
ready
for
a
crisp
hoppy
pils
but
this
is
nothing
more
than
schmidts
from
colorado
no
hoppy
aromas
no
hoppiness
in
the
flavor
hardly
anything
impressive
here
avoid
lovers
of
good
beer
what
were
they
thinking
this
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
perhaps
the
first
czech
pilsner
ive
liked
the
mouthfeel
is
mostly
whats
expected
with
a
crisp
fairly
refreshing
texture
and
an
expected
level
of
carbonation
considering
the
style
enjoyable
and
satisfying
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
your
a
fan
of
the
style
pours
out
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
very
clear
filled
with
carbonation
bubbles
up
and
down
the
glass
rising
and
clinging
through
the
beer
with
a
1
5cm
head
loose
bubbles
that
sort
of
cling
from
the
start
but
clear
out
kind
of
quickly
maybe
i
shouldve
poured
more
vigorously
the
smell
is
immediately
of
powdery
sweet
malts
with
a
good
charge
of
earthy
herbal
hops
very
little
else
perfectly
clean
and
straighforward
both
smell
and
taste
are
what
id
expect
better
than
average
but
i
dont
know
what
outstanding
would
entail
for
the
style
the
taste
is
pretty
impressive
the
malt
backbone
is
really
flavorful
for
the
simplicity
i
would
guess
there
was
some
decoction
involved
melanoidin
flavor
and
pilsener
malt
has
a
nice
flavor
in
itself
the
hops
are
pleasant
herbal
spicy
kind
of
a
mint
flavor
then
theres
the
leafy
earthy
notes
its
very
cdrisp
finishes
dry
after
the
initial
sweetness
there
is
a
lasting
flavor
that
sort
of
cling
to
the
inside
of
your
mouth
the
carbonation
is
quite
sharp
which
holds
me
back
but
it
also
puts
this
about
in
line
with
the
style
the
same
kind
of
goes
for
the
drinkability
pretty
easy
pleasant
subtle
everything
thats
nice
about
the
style
d
a
very
nice
summer
beer
would
love
to
drink
this
on
the
river
while
tubing
d
not
the
best
pils
but
will
do
in
a
pinch
poured
with
a
big
white
head
no
lace
aroma
was
very
floral
aromatic
malty
and
nice
color
is
a
bright
polished
brass
flavor
is
very
malty
sweet
with
some
good
hops
and
some
other
odd
chemical
flavor
that
disappears
after
the
first
few
sips
real
good
carbonationmouthfeel
definitely
a
session
beer
nothing
exciting
but
what
pilsner
is
solid
beer
i
would
definitely
take
a
six
pack
of
this
to
the
lake
nice
to
try
something
new
from
ob
after
years
of
enjoying
the
crap
out
of
all
their
better
know
selections
this
one
leaves
the
can
with
canned
on
dating
on
the
bottom
nice
and
is
light
slightly
hazed
and
golden
under
a
well
developed
retentive
and
fluffy
white
head
plenty
of
spotty
lace
and
froth
left
behind
grass
and
light
fruit
in
the
nose
this
one
displays
a
bit
of
the
expected
pils
crispness
and
grassy
goodness
sort
of
buttery
in
both
mouthfeel
and
on
the
flavor
sensors
nothing
too
special
but
decent
enough
as
a
sessioner
or
warm
weather
quencher
from
the
can
it
poured
a
clear
pale
gold
with
a
tall
white
head
sweet
white
bread
with
a
lemon
edge
that
grows
to
bitter
herbal
hops
while
the
malt
develops
into
a
dry
biscuit
like
youd
pour
stew
or
gravy
over
the
aroma
smells
of
fresh
dough
with
hints
of
pepper
theres
just
enough
bitterness
to
make
this
satisfying
for
any
hophead
but
its
balanced
enough
to
let
this
tasty
brew
make
a
great
session
lager
very
good
beer
hear
12oz
can
into
a
boston
lager
glass
a
crisp
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
some
earthy
hops
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
sweet
fruits
the
taste
is
a
decent
balance
of
malts
and
hops
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
the
beer
is
certainly
light
and
crisp
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
this
one
makes
for
a
good
summer
beer
but
is
barely
a
step
up
from
a
macro
like
its
other
offerings
maliyep
has
some
meat
on
its
bones
its
nice
to
see
another
domestic
craft
pilsner
out
on
the
market
im
gonna
have
to
revisit
some
other
pils
to
double
check
i
might
have
a
new
champ
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
thick
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
noticable
carbonation
smells
like
a
pilsner
very
simple
with
sweet
malts
and
slight
hop
aromas
smells
similar
to
a
miller
or
budweiser
taste
is
sweet
malt
at
first
followed
by
a
slight
fruity
hop
flavor
and
then
the
flavors
abruptly
stop
and
give
way
to
a
lingering
bitterness
i
would
say
that
the
malt
flavor
is
a
little
bit
more
up
front
than
a
normal
pilsner
and
the
hop
flavor
is
actually
detectable
pushing
it
a
notch
above
all
the
other
pilsners
out
there
it
is
a
very
simple
beer
and
well
balanced
very
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
that
had
good
retention
a
large
of
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
the
weakest
part
of
this
beer
seems
to
be
that
the
pilsners
i
really
like
have
a
huge
noble
hop
aroma
this
beer
lacks
this
just
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
soggy
cardboard
aroma
but
hops
are
tasted
they
are
spicy
and
herbal
in
quality
just
a
litle
lemon
as
well
on
the
drier
side
as
well
which
i
prefer
light
body
with
lively
carbonation
that
cuts
short
of
being
harsh
a
good
pilsner
available
in
a
can
a
good
warm
weather
alternative
to
macro
lagers
poured
a
pretty
nice
initial
head
and
disappeared
pretty
quickly
right
off
the
bat
it
smelled
like
your
normal
pilsner
had
a
nice
golden
color
to
it
very
clear
not
a
bit
cloudy
it
was
an
alright
smooth
pilsner
with
no
real
defined
aftertaste
but
was
not
a
bit
skanky
which
coming
out
of
a
can
i
was
very
happy
and
suprised
with
it
is
a
very
light
and
smooth
pilsner
that
is
easy
to
drink
nothing
flashy
i
have
to
say
not
bad
certainly
drinkable
would
go
well
with
a
hot
sun
and
baseball
poured
from
the
can
though
it
is
the
best
pils
ive
had
out
of
a
can
a
golden
yellow
surprise
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dies
off
quickly
a
bit
sweet
taste
with
a
smooth
and
easy
finish
easy
to
drink
from
the
can
or
a
glass
found
at
midway
mart
for
the
dfw
folks
i
could
drink
these
all
day
if
i
enjoyed
pilsners
get
some
kick
back
and
enjoy
you
wont
be
disappointed
pours
a
pure
clean
and
clear
gold
with
a
quick
disappearing
fizzy
white
head
aropma
is
slightly
sweet
like
movie
popcorn
butter
some
light
lemon
zest
and
pepper
but
mostly
the
butter
thing
pleasant
though
taste
is
pure
and
clean
lots
of
grainy
earthiness
with
a
tremendous
hop
kick
slightly
piney
and
floral
twinge
of
sweetness
there
to
balance
it
out
but
overall
a
very
balanced
and
slightly
bitter
pilsner
little
more
sweetness
in
the
finish
like
butterscotch
and
hops
good
stuff
a
tad
too
sweet
but
that
doesnt
t
hold
it
back
this
is
the
first
oskar
blues
beer
that
ive
found
to
be
bland
and
unimpressive
had
it
from
a
can
at
the
flying
saucer
in
houston
pours
yellow
with
about
half
inch
head
biscuity
and
some
hop
aroma
lots
of
biscuit
in
the
taste
with
some
corn
and
grain
bland
in
the
middle
with
a
crisp
finsih
average
pilsner
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
maybe
will
try
again
if
available
on
tap
i
like
this
and
ill
probably
be
sneaking
this
into
my
golf
bag
all
summer
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
too
often
because
i
think
there
are
better
beers
out
there
in
cans
that
can
go
with
me
to
places
bottles
cant
go
i
like
pilsners
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
nothing
overpowering
but
a
small
uppercut
of
bitter
hops
towards
the
finish
this
pils
does
not
have
it
it
actually
seemed
a
little
watery
not
my
first
choice
in
the
future
this
was
a
fantastic
example
of
a
czech
pils
i
really
wish
this
brewery
would
expand
or
at
least
distribute
to
in
or
il
theres
not
enough
brews
available
in
cans
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
body
some
small
white
color
head
quickly
diminishing
malty
somewhat
skunky
aroma
some
mustiness
not
overly
strong
light
lagery
taste
some
graininess
and
a
hoppy
aftertaste
a
little
skunky
tasting
but
not
too
bad
some
lager
maltiness
very
carbonated
taste
has
a
hefty
spicy
hop
flavor
without
a
ton
of
bitterness
i
dont
feel
like
i
am
getting
enough
sweet
malts
to
balance
it
out
though
and
the
beer
comes
across
as
undercarbonated
and
thin
i
like
most
of
the
ob
lineup
and
i
love
saaz
but
i
thought
this
one
was
just
ok
for
10six
pack
this
is
not
a
bargain
d
theres
something
a
bit
off
with
this
beer
nothing
that
ruins
it
for
me
but
im
not
tempted
to
finish
the
whole
six
pack
in
one
session
so
far
this
is
the
worst
offering
ive
had
from
oskar
blues
theres
better
pilsners
out
there
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
earth
shattering
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
and
czech
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
all
malt
flavor
that
boasts
of
pilsner
malts
and
czech
hops
its
well
balanced
and
quite
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
pilsner
its
tastey
and
not
over
hopped
it
well
balanced
treat
d
i
could
drink
a
keg
phenomenal
pilsener
mamas
little
yella
pils
may
not
have
the
bells
and
whistles
but
to
expect
them
would
be
missing
the
point
the
pilsner
is
meant
above
all
else
to
be
quenching
and
easily
quaffed
to
find
one
of
this
quality
youd
usually
have
to
be
in
europe
this
is
a
most
agreeable
unarguably
refreshing
beverage
if
you
like
beer
at
all
then
you
should
like
this
their
beer
has
quite
a
hoppy
little
dry
bite
to
it
there
are
some
leafy
grainy
dryish
hop
notes
along
with
the
refreshing
pilsner
type
slightly
prickly
mouth
feel
its
refreshing
but
not
my
favorite
pilsner
good
ass
beer
it
shines
on
the
aftertaste
starts
out
like
a
regular
pilsner
but
becomes
something
bigger
and
tastier
by
the
end
overall
i
prefer
a
slightly
more
intrinsic
example
but
wellexecuted
nonetheless
the
drinkability
is
solid
its
an
easy
drinker
with
some
nice
flavors
though
i
feel
it
could
be
a
bit
cleaner
overall
a
nice
pils
thats
got
the
plus
of
being
in
a
can
d
extremely
drinkable
and
very
sessionable
i
can
easily
see
many
of
these
going
down
in
one
sitting
under
the
right
circumstances
overall
i
would
say
great
beer
from
the
description
on
the
brewerys
website
its
pretty
much
dead
on
what
they
were
looking
for
ill
definitely
recommend
this
one
and
drink
again
served
in
my
warsteiner
pilsener
glass
poured
a
bright
translucent
yellow
with
copious
tiny
bubbles
effervescing
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
to
the
underside
of
the
cap
frothy
bright
white
three
inch
head
composed
of
bubbles
of
varying
size
fair
head
retention
head
eventually
recedes
into
a
thin
consistent
cap
with
clouds
of
lacing
adhering
during
the
session
mild
nose
grainy
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
lemon
clean
taste
some
residual
cereal
grains
with
again
a
suggestion
of
citric
acid
finishes
fairly
clean
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
and
mildly
effervescent
quite
sessionable
if
your
looking
for
something
simple
and
easy
drinking
however
a
very
uncharacteristic
oskar
blues
offering
might
be
a
good
transition
beer
for
the
macro
crowd
a
bit
disappointing
especially
from
this
brewery
but
overall
a
drinkable
pilsner
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
this
beer
definitely
got
better
as
it
warmed
overall
while
no
where
near
my
favorite
beer
i
would
have
to
give
it
a
thumbs
up
for
being
very
drinakble
a
good
summer
beer
overall
a
well
done
pilsner
which
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
like
the
canned
version
better
than
i
remember
it
on
draft
a
serviceable
if
not
decent
pilsner
easy
to
drink
but
falls
short
of
greatness
definitely
not
worth
the
9
price
for
a
sixer
drinkability
super
easy
drinking
pils
here
nice
flavors
and
the
handy
can
will
be
great
for
some
outdoor
activities
pours
a
light
yellow
with
white
head
the
lacing
lingers
and
carbonation
is
effervescent
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
earthy
hop
notes
the
taste
is
a
bit
bready
with
subtle
notes
of
lemon
grass
and
straw
that
fight
through
the
carbonation
it
finishes
with
a
little
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
lager
yeast
but
not
as
crisp
or
sharp
as
other
american
craft
pilseners
very
drinkable
perfect
for
the
summer
its
not
as
bold
as
the
rest
of
their
line
its
more
mainstream
and
truer
to
style
a
very
refreshing
pilsner
on
the
lighter
side
in
terms
of
hops
perfect
for
the
summer
months
its
ok
at
best
good
beer
giver
a
try
this
beer
pored
yellow
with
a
singlefinger
head
that
lasted
for
a
little
while
the
smell
is
sweet
with
some
grains
and
breadiness
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
bready
malt
that
slowly
gives
way
to
a
little
bit
of
hops
that
linger
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
with
some
fine
carbonation
that
make
for
a
refreshing
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
thats
got
a
decent
amount
of
character
while
still
retaining
its
drinkability
pours
a
brilliant
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
light
and
has
a
mild
dms
corn
note
flavor
is
mainly
pils
malt
not
much
of
the
spicy
sazz
hop
flavor
i
would
expect
some
breadyyeasty
character
crisp
mediumlight
body
and
high
carbonation
feel
not
bad
a
good
run
of
the
mill
pilsner
jim
d
good
summer
beer
not
too
heavy
but
more
depth
of
flavor
than
a
true
light
beer
d
this
is
an
adequate
pils
but
its
really
a
letdown
after
enjoying
all
of
the
other
fine
beers
canned
by
oskar
blues
i
was
hoping
for
another
good
craft
pilsner
to
add
to
the
rotation
but
i
dont
think
this
makes
the
cut
i
was
excited
to
see
a
new
can
on
the
shelves
from
oskar
blues
but
ultimately
i
was
disappointed
an
okay
beer
d
it
goes
down
quick
easy
and
it
is
refreshing
ill
give
it
that
not
a
horrid
beer
by
any
means
but
maybe
lacking
a
little
glad
to
have
tried
it
ill
probably
stick
with
other
offerings
from
the
brewery
drinkability
this
one
screams
it
for
me
bring
it
to
casper
and
its
an
instant
classic
for
me
i
like
to
think
of
it
as
a
comfort
beer
d
i
could
easily
drink
a
6
pack
or
2
in
one
night
like
i
said
i
dont
care
of
pilsners
that
well
but
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
needed
something
to
drink
the
only
other
pilsner
i
can
say
is
better
is
the
olde
town
pilsner
note
to
those
who
havent
noticed
it
the
can
actually
says
malt
liquor
on
it
right
next
to
the
government
warning
kinda
funny
i
thought
pours
a
clear
light
straw
color
with
a
frothy
quickly
dissipating
white
head
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
a
light
floral
hop
aroma
dominate
the
nose
first
sip
is
all
malt
with
a
light
saaznobel
hop
profile
great
example
of
the
style
light
and
refreshing
what
a
pils
should
be
does
the
lawn
need
mowing
a
mediocre
attempt
at
a
sweeter
pils
is
all
rather
bland
pretty
drinkable
but
lacking
it
lacks
the
refreshing
character
that
this
style
should
have
for
a
better
canned
pilsner
go
for
sly
foxs
pikeland
overall
nah
just
didnt
care
for
it
sweet
yet
bland
worth
buying
a
single
but
not
6er
worthy
finishes
clean
and
crisp
very
drinkable
and
would
be
nice
in
the
warmer
months
in
can
hopefully
theyll
have
it
available
around
these
parts
d
very
accessible
pilsner
extremely
sessionable
not
a
standout
in
the
category
but
quite
respectable
its
nice
to
see
oskar
blues
adding
more
of
a
session
beer
to
their
portfolio
i
really
dont
think
oskar
blues
quite
hit
the
mark
on
this
one
the
aroma
and
flavor
seem
a
little
too
sweet
to
me
and
despite
being
drinkable
this
is
just
an
average
pilsener
notes
from
and
tasted
on
31009
id
take
any
other
oskar
blues
beer
over
this
any
day
im
drinking
it
as
we
speak
though
someone
has
to
good
stuff
and
something
that
was
badly
needed
in
colorado
a
canned
session
lager
is
a
great
thing
on
so
many
levels
overall
impression
very
nice
addition
to
the
ob
stable
i
can
imagine
drinking
quite
a
bit
of
this
when
the
weather
warms
up
drinkability
is
good
not
a
great
pilsener
but
its
good
and
worth
trying
a
nice
crowd
pleasing
beer
to
add
to
the
lineup
but
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
they
make
nothing
especially
bad
about
it
but
its
not
exceptional
like
their
others
i
expected
more
of
an
uber
pils
had
this
on
tap
at
pb
tap
room
listed
as
mama
yella
or
something
as
the
guy
below
mentioned
i
believe
listed
as
6
poured
an
extremely
clear
golden
color
with
no
head
really
very
clean
light
aroma
of
noble
hops
and
slight
sulfur
tasted
like
an
american
pilsner
should
not
a
lot
of
hop
presence
light
sweetness
very
easy
to
drink
and
carbonated
just
right
i
could
have
a
lot
of
this
beer
while
theres
not
much
to
say
about
it
its
just
a
clean
well
made
beer
i
would
get
it
again
but
ive
never
seen
it
before
so
well
see
if
it
continues
to
show
up
around
town
had
this
on
tap
very
recently
at
the
brick
store
pub
is
this
a
new
batch
or
a
stored
keg
i
have
no
idea
but
it
tasted
perfectly
fresh
that
said
this
wasnt
the
most
impressive
pilsner
ive
ever
had
but
it
was
decent
poured
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
faded
away
to
nothing
smelled
grainy
and
fresh
and
with
a
bit
of
cereal
grain
sweetness
the
taste
is
light
and
grainy
with
little
hop
presence
soft
and
a
bit
grainy
in
the
mouth
but
nice
enough
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
interest
the
appearance
of
the
beer
was
a
good
wheat
color
with
a
yellowish
white
foam
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
that
of
a
typical
pilsner
in
that
it
has
the
aromas
of
the
wheat
and
coliander
but
nothing
that
really
stuck
out
the
taste
of
it
followed
suit
but
tones
of
cloves
could
be
picked
up
overall
this
beer
is
a
good
pilsner
to
have
just
not
too
overly
impressed
with
it
as
it
is
a
typical
pilsner
overall
this
was
a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
style
but
the
flavors
just
dont
have
enough
to
them
they
kind
of
sneak
up
instead
of
asserting
themselves
still
not
a
bad
beer
and
im
always
open
to
anything
oskar
blues
puts
out
drinkability
woefully
average
really
its
acceptable
sure
but
theres
just
not
an
overly
expressive
character
and
it
comes
off
just
like
any
other
plain
old
pilsner
on
tap
at
oskar
blues
in
lyons
clear
yellow
white
head
smells
decent
tastes
good
and
earthy
like
many
pilsners
i
have
had
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
companion
for
their
wings
this
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
a
can
to
mow
lawns
barbecue
or
take
hiking
highly
drinkable
a
great
pilsner
poured
into
a
16
oz
goblet
a
gorgeous
deep
golden
color
very
little
head
and
what
there
was
didnt
last
long
very
little
visual
evidence
of
carbonation
an
unusually
strong
smell
of
malted
barley
and
saaz
hops
i
could
actually
smell
it
at
arms
length
in
the
bottle
before
i
poured
it
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
hint
of
sour
after
the
swallow
i
kept
waiting
for
that
strong
hop
bitterness
that
my
nose
detected
earlier
but
it
was
subtle
and
came
on
gradually
more
complex
than
the
betterknown
czech
pilsners
that
im
used
to
drinking
soft
carbonation
smooth
with
a
heavier
body
than
i
expected
not
very
bitter
but
what
there
is
stays
with
you
a
long
time
theres
a
thick
buttery
feel
on
the
tongue
long
after
the
glass
is
empty
ive
always
loved
czech
pilsners
and
i
think
ill
be
calling
this
one
my
favorite
at
least
for
now
easy
drinking
but
with
some
complexity
as
well
overall
45
not
a
bad
pilsener
that
is
well
supported
by
its
hops
not
the
best
czech
beer
ive
had
and
not
the
worst
o
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
likely
have
it
again
it
paired
very
nicely
with
some
spicy
food
hot
wings
because
of
the
resfreshing
flavor
overall
a
somewhat
lackluster
example
of
a
czech
pils
i
doubt
i
will
get
it
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
it
tastes
good
same
ol
green
bottle
beer
i
go
get
something
in
a
brown
bottle
if
you
dont
mind
a
fairly
satisfying
pilsener
fairly
true
to
the
style
but
with
a
few
rough
edges
remaining
still
quite
drinkable
and
sessionable
could
be
good
for
summer
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
more
than
that
the
used
hops
are
not
the
hops
we
like
in
europe
the
germans
do
a
better
job
d
i
hated
drinking
this
it
didnt
taste
terrible
didnt
smell
very
bad
but
the
ridiculous
chunks
and
globs
of
yeast
and
whatever
else
that
were
floating
around
in
this
beer
make
thinking
about
drinking
it
very
unpleasant
and
the
actual
act
of
drinking
it
even
worse
every
time
i
would
take
a
sip
i
would
close
my
lips
around
the
glass
as
much
as
possible
and
cringe
when
a
chunk
would
meet
my
lips
as
reasonable
as
this
beer
may
have
been
i
hated
every
second
of
drinking
it
tastes
a
bit
bitter
and
lagery
there
is
some
real
yeastiness
to
it
that
overpowers
everything
the
malt
profile
is
subtle
and
heavily
sweet
caramel
and
maybe
some
hints
of
crystal
not
bad
overall
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
the
chunks
are
gross
overall
okay
but
not
good
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
although
its
very
malty
the
beer
isnt
overly
filling
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
because
of
its
strong
malty
flavor
there
are
better
czech
pils
d
this
is
a
nice
and
light
beer
that
suits
the
warm
night
i
drank
it
on
its
well
balanced
and
offers
some
nice
subtleties
that
emerge
over
time
a
very
nice
pils
d
although
this
isnt
going
to
set
my
world
on
fire
its
pretty
drinkable
it
would
be
a
good
pairing
for
a
bbq
and
some
warm
weather
overall
not
bad
but
there
are
far
better
versions
out
there
it
went
down
ok
notes
i
think
im
giving
this
beer
a
high
score
because
its
over
100
degrees
right
now
hahaha
but
its
a
good
flavorful
pilsner
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
poured
from
a
green
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
taste
is
crisp
malats
finishing
bitter
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
mediocre
beer
it
is
an
average
beer
d
while
this
beer
is
far
from
fantastic
its
drinkability
is
not
so
basically
this
is
a
great
contender
for
das
boot
or
any
vessel
over
one
liter
its
no
wonder
that
ab
has
fought
with
this
brewery
for
decades
over
trademark
issues
i
can
see
that
ab
likely
fears
a
beer
that
seems
more
drinkable
than
the
american
budweiser
mouthfeeldrinkability
average
at
best
the
carbonation
feels
right
at
first
but
a
half
hour
into
this
tasting
it
begins
to
really
flatten
out
flabby
for
the
style
it
doesnt
qualify
for
me
as
a
worthwhile
food
beer
either
again
i
have
no
way
of
knowing

aroma
thats
slightly
sweet
its
light
and
very
smooth
and
the
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
its
has
a
very
light
sweetness
and
very
light
bitterness
with
a
grassy
grainy
flavor
that
leaves
no
aftertaste
its
a
real
quaffer
t
kind
of
a
fruity
pilsner
im
not
sure
but
theres
like
an
appleish
taste
in
there
i
would
not
prefer
this
over
most
czech
pilsners
but
this
is
definitely
quality
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
generous
head
minimal
lacing
smelled
of
pilsner
malt
and
hops
taste
was
clean
and
refreshing
but
somewhat
sweet
for
a
pilsner
i
thought
not
as
dry
a
finish
as
some
mouthfeel
was
average
for
this
style
and
drinkablity
was
good
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
ontap
at
tap
and
table
for
5pint
this
is
a
tasty
and
fresh
czech
pilsener
something
thats
hard
to
some
by
a
lot
of
alleged
czech
pils
are
really
just
bland
macro
lagers
theres
a
smooth
dry
bready
malt
taste
and
the
pils
finishes
with
a
mildly
bitter
spicy
hop
taste
very
nice
and
very
refreshing
pilslovers
should
seek
this
out
there
was
barely
any
smell
at
all
the
taste
is
smooth
and
lightly
fruity
no
hop
taste
at
all
smooth
feel
goes
down
real
easy
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
it
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
a
rather
dry
pils
not
much
of
a
hop
profile
predominantly
dry
and
even
a
bit
straw
like
head
retention
and
lace
are
favorable
but
smell
is
a
bit
sour
for
the
style
under
my
understanding
keg
code
is
current

expiration
an
in
code
pils
should
not
have
sour
notes
but
in
this
case
its
actually
quite
refreshing
its
hot
and
muggy
outside
it
fits
but
if
i
were
more
objective
i
would
see
this
flaw
in
a
more
negative
sense
clean
finishing
makes
it
a
great
summer
thirst
quencher
the
beer
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
dry
pilsner
malt
scent
with
little
hop
aroma
it
has
an
all
malt
scent
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
pilsner
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
next
to
no
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
drinking
lager
it
was
hoping
for
more
hop
character
but
all
in
all
not
bad
overall
the
bottle
i
have
may
be
old
i
cannot
find
a
best
by
or
production
date
on
it
it
seems
flat
to
me
i
will
try
another
in
the
future
the
taste
has
a
very
light
but
clean
consistent
bready
grainmalt
backbone
with
a
persistent
hint
of
apple
peels
but
the
herbalgrassy
hop
flavour
and
bitterness
clearly
dominates
without
being
overly
strong
it
has
a
lingering
engaging
lightly
bitter
herbal
finish
and
aftertaste
its
crisp
and
lively
lacking
the
lightly
oily
thicker
quality
of
some
like
budweiser
budvar
prost
d
nearly
perfect
on
a
warm
late
summer
afternoon
like
this
one
this
hits
the
spot
like
no
other
this
one
has
session
written
all
over
it
im
just
pissed
that
i
only
have
one
bottle
bright
yellow
with
a
light
island
of
foam
after
the
pour
and
a
uniform
column
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
the
aroma
is
good
clean
pilsner
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
lemony
hops
very
even
malts
and
a
lightly
inserted
hop
a
but
watery
tasting
though
the
water
used
was
a
bit
too
soft
i
think
just
a
touch
of
mineral
dryness
would
make
this
pisner
much
more
refreshing
just
the
thing
after
a
hard
das
work
on
a
warm
day
d
par
excellence
bb
burgerbrau
is
a
great
name
but
a
pretty
good
beer
a
solid
example
of
a
czech
pilsner
d
overall
a
decent
clean
macro
style
lager
with
ok
drinkability
worthy
of
a
moderate
rating
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
sparse
lacing
aroma
is
enticing
but
simple
with
spicy
and
earthy
hops
and
bready
malts
medium
body
is
bolstered
by
the
malt
presence
and
carbonation
is
moderate
sweet
bready
malts
dominate
the
taste
with
a
subdued
hops
bittering
that
is
spicy
and
herbal
very
interesting
for
a
pilsner
very
drinkable
even
sessionable
drinkabilitypersonally
i
could
drink
this
for
hours
with
or
without
food
not
that
i
drink
more
than
a
glass
often
but
were
i
to
its
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
its
complex
without
being
extreme
or
challenging
in
the
manner
of
good
english
pale
to
golden
ales
its
definitely
not
an
american
beer
at
either

hooray
or
the
sweet
massproduced
pap
of
budweisercoorsetc
boo
if
drinking
with
food
i
would
have
it
with
sourdough
and
a
hard
sheeps
cheese
all
in
all
a
wellmade
pilsener
whose
strong
point
is
the
nice
bitter
finish
lack
of
complexity
will
keep
me
from
going
out
of
my
way
to
drink
more
d
a
good
pils
probably
wont
buy
again
but
i
liked
it
and
glad
i
tried
it
would
be
an
easy
drinker
on
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
very
special
about
this
beer
but
very
refreshing
and
a
good
crisp
thirst
quencher
d
light
and
easy
to
drink
a
bad
looking
pour
but
a
quaffable
drinking
lager
id
have
another
ok
its
malty
but
in
line
with
urquell
and
budvar
as
well
as
what
i
remember
about
kumburak
huge
head
nice
lace
hops
are
there
and
leave
almost
a
hint
of
peppery
spiciness
but
not
overly
floral
a
great
start
to
what
looks
to
be
a
great
rest
of
the
day
b
b
burgerbrau
was
a
good
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
smooth
beer
with
a
mild
hop
taste
and
is
nice
for
a
summer
day
mild
wheat
taste
to
it
really
refreshing
overall
what
one
might
expect
for
a
basic
czech
pilsner
id
buy
it
again
it
reminds
me
of
different
german
pilsners
that
i
have
had
before
just
an
average
beer
here
very
mild
grainy
aroma
that
was
difficult
to
really
get
a
sense
of
as
it
seemed
so
faint
not
very
crisp
hops
are
not
really
present
they
seem
to
show
up
about
half
way
through
the
bottle
but
still
faint
color
is
a
pale
golden
color
typical
of
many
beers
of
this
style
very
average
i
would
not
shell
out
import
prices
for
this
beer
if
it
were
being
served
as
the
only
beer
at
a
party
or
on
sale
i
would
give
it
a
go
but
i
would
not
go
in
search
of
it
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
overall
its
decent
enough
but
pretty
unremarkable
i
think
the
delicate
malty
has
probably
declined
in
storage
a
nice
one
for
an
easy
sessionable
a
classic
example
of
a
czech
pils
it
would
be
nice
if
bud
tasted
were
like
this
12
oz
bottle
color
of
golden
yellow
with
a
quickly
dissipating
thin
offwhite
head
nose
of
grass
skunk
slight
skunk
slight
oats
metallic
and
melon
soft
taste
of
grass
lemon
some
metal
and
oats
body
is
soft
watery
slight
acidity
and
with
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
grass
lime
zest
and
metallic
notes
overall
it
was
worthy
of
the
purchase
and
ill
be
happy
to
finish
the
entire
sixer
and
enjoy
every
one
that
being
said
it
is
slightly
below
average
in
my
overall
thoughts
steve
oh
well
drinkability
drinkable
but
nothing
special
to
speak
of
drinks
easy
but
with
such
a
lack
of
flavor
why
bother
d
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
this
was
the
sweetness
was
quite
good
aroma
was
strongly
of
sweet
corn
and
not
beer
flavor
was
a
sweet
maltiness
that
seemed
artificial
and
i
did
not
care
for
it
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
heavy
and
i
didnt
care
for
it
i
did
not
find
this
beer
to
be
fairly
drinkable
id
pick
a
pilsner
urquell
over
this
every
day
of
the
week
and
twice
on
sunday
overall
flavor
is
a
bit
flat
despite
being
a
clean
and
somewhat
hoppy
beer
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
lacked
a
certain
umph
also
my
bottle
said
4
7
rather
than
5
0
abv
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
is
by
no
means
a
must
try
it
beer
this
is
a
good
bitter
pilsner
like
i
like
them
but
it
doesnt
bring
any
spiciness
to
the
party
probably
this
is
a
far
better
beer
in
europe
but
by
the
time
it
spends
six
weeks
on
a
boat
and
who
knows
how
long
in
a
warehouse
this
is
just
a
little
better
than
average
beer
burgerbrau
pours
a
crystalclear
golden
robe
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
brightwhite
foam
the
head
steadily
settles
into
a
wide
foamy
collar
that
leaves
only
average
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
grassy
and
floral
over
a
bready
malt
basic
clean
concise
the
flavor
offers
a
little
more
oomph
with
a
wider
but
still
very
straightforward
maltiness
and
even
stronger
hop
flavors
a
bold
bitterness
balances
it
and
it
finishes
quite
dry
with
a
lingering
bitterness
thats
strewn
with
grassy
and
spicy
hop
flavors
although
it
might
not
turn
heads
burgerbrau
is
a
solidlymade
very
drinkable
czech
pils
that
cant
be
argued
with
as
an
everyday
pour
nicely
done
i
am
always
hopeful
but
wary
when
i
reach
for
a
european
lager
with
a
shiny
shiny
label
in
green
glass
bottles
i
am
hopeful
because
fine
and
delicious
brew
is
often
found
therein
wary
because
as
often
as
not
the
beer
has
been
treated
to
suboptimum
conditions
and
has
become
skunky
sure
this
could
happen
to
virtually
any
beer
but
it
is
more
common
in
central
and
eastern
european
lagers
because
they
have
to
travel
so
far
they
use
a
lot
of
green
glass
and
a
lot
of
hops
so
i
opened
my
b
b
bürgerbräu
with
tempered
expectations
what
i
got
was
just
a
very
faint
hint
of
the
feared
skunkiness
which
i
was
willing
to
bear
if
the
reward
was
good
enough
aside
from
the
mild
skunk
i
found
the
aroma
to
be
pleasantly
perfumeyfloralhoppy
the
flavor
had
a
nicely
full
malty
sweetness
well
countered
by
a
healthy
dose
of
hop
bitterness
leaving
a
crisp
dry
finish
its
not
quite
as
rich
as
czechvar
budvar
or
as
spicyhoppy
as
pilsenerurquell
but
very
easy
to
drink
to
be
sure
another
solid
czech
lager
that
i
would
happily
drink
again
if
its
fresh
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
goldenlight
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
grainy
biscuity
grassy
hops
and
honey
first
it
tastes
like
grain
and
sweet
malt
and
then
has
a
grassy
hops
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
with
moderate
carbonation
and
it
is
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
an
ok
beer
overall
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
im
a
sucker
for
any
czech
beer
but
what
can
i
say
im
czech
overall
not
the
best
czech
beer
ive
had
but
still
good
12
ounce
bottle
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
zesty
but
the
body
was
thin
i
wanted
to
like
this
pilsner
but
it
fell
short
drinkability
is
tops
the
czech
like
the
germans
know
how
to
brew
a
highly
quaffable
pils
great
stuff
appearance
smell
are
typical
of
the
style
bright
gold
with
sudsy
white
flecks
of
foam
with
a
slight
grassy
hop
smell
that
differentiates
it
a
little
taste
is
crisp
and
smooth
some
hearty
grain
floral
hops
with
a
residual
herbal
note
and
an
impression
of
mineral
water
very
easy
to
drink
truly
a
quintessential
session
pilsner
a
deep
golden
color
with
an
eighth
of
an
inch
head
that
quickly
fades
away
the
scent
of
roasted
barley
and
malt
are
very
dominant
with
a
touch
hop
spiciness
at
the
end
a
very
mild
flavor
at
first
mostly
of
the
barley
and
malt
then
strong
bite
of
biterness
comes
in
right
at
the
end
and
hits
the
palate
very
watery
in
the
mouth
though
a
strong
tingle
from
carbonation
does
hit
the
back
of
the
throat
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
a
lack
flavor
pulls
this
beer
down
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
retains
ok
the
aroma
is
grassy
and
grainy
with
a
touch
of
biscuit
floral
hops
and
some
metallic
notes
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
grass
and
grain
notes
upfront
along
with
some
mild
floral
hops
corn
biscuit
and
some
metallicity
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
descent
an
ok
czech
pilsner
not
as
brisk
and
hoppy
as
id
hoped
but
drinkable
nonetheless
overall
a
slighty
above
average
czech
pilsner
and
quite
drinkable
but
was
hoping
for
for
a
tad
more
drinkability
no
real
reason
to
get
this
over
many
of
the
others
in
the
style
not
wonderful
but
a
capable
example
of
the
style
this
is
original
enough
to
be
interesting
although
somewhat
similar
to
budvar
obviously
i
was
hoping
for
a
beer
of
budweiser
budvar
czechvar
or
pilsner
urquells
elegance
but
still
this
is
a
drinkabel
pilsner
pretty
middleoftheroad
for
its
style
sure
it
has
nice
pilsner
maltiness
noble
hops
and
quite
clean
but
it
has
no
ass
simply
safe
and
simple
medium
on
all
aroma
taste
and
texture
profiles
lightly
grainy
and
nicely
malty
spiced
nicely
with
saaz
hops
its
a
fine
beer
but
i
would
expect
to
be
challenged
with
any
of
this
beers
experiences
d
not
bad
not
great
fairly
average
but
better
than
american
budejovicer
smooth
mild
aromatic
and
malty
czech
lager
i
prefer
it
to
much
more
famous
budvarczechvar
for
its
more
complex
and
delicate
lots
of
hoppyflowery
aroma
with
a
subtle
note
of
yeast
round
a
bit
sweetish
taste
with
merry
hoppy
aftertaste
the
only
really
bad
thing
about
it
is
the
supply
cant
find
this
beer
when
i
really
want
it
overall
simple
and
lacking
in
flavor
and
depth
a
pretty
simple
beer
made
for
easy
drinking
with
a
pretty
good
flavor
overall
a
very
drinkable
pils
typical
of
the
style
pours
a
watery
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
minimal
coating
of
white
bubbles
nose
is
stale
malt
and
musty

taste
is
more
of
the
same
grassy
and
musty
malt
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
crisp
skunky
bland
eurolager
not
a
fan
at
all
must
be
too
subtle
for
my
american
tastes

moderate

some

flavour
is
fairly
clean
with
a

does
not
last

an

but
not
much
more
than
that
b
b
burgerbrau
is
supposed
to
be
the
forerunner
of
the
modern
day
budweiser
the
american
one
im
not
sure
thats
something
to
be
proud
of
given
how
the
king
of
beers
tastes
but
facts
is
facts
and
if
the
brewery
wants
to
trumpet
that
particular
fact
from
the
highest
mountaintop
more
power
to
em
frankly
neither
one
of
them
is
worth
a
damn
opinion
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
is
really
clean
and
would
show
even
the
slightest
flaw
so
in
that
respect
it
is
a
good
beer
the
balance
is
really
weak
for
even
a
lighter
style
of
beer
i
believe
that
it
should
start
with
a
lot
more
depth
in
the
malt
to
help
round
out
the
beer
it
is
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
any
time
soon
this
is
a
bad
beer
well
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
in
the
summer
but
as
a
czech
pils
worth
going
back
for
i
think
not
still
i
wont
turn
one
down
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
council
bluffs
ia
it
is
worth
a
try
but
it
fails
to
represent
its
style
to
the
fullest
the
flavors
in
this
brew
fall
on
the
borderline
of
subtle
and
bland
a
bit
more
watery
than
i
would
expect
from
the
czechs
arguably
the
best
pils
brewers
in
the
world
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
flavors
that
are
here
arent
bad
but
it
just
seems
that
there
isnt
enough
of
them
in
this
brew
d
good
drinkability
sessionability
nice
pilsner
pours
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
goes
quickly
leaving
no
lace
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
chrystal
clear

but
then
the

kick
in

for

from

westborough
ma
mediocre
macro
tasting
skunk
fest
with
a
nice
noble

finish
not
too
unlike
becks
very
good
head
for
the

slow

and
steady

slightly
tart
metallic
medium

mouthfeel
tastes
likebeer
there
seems
to
be
real
potential
here
but
unfortunately
this
one
falls
ill
to
the
european
green
bottle
flu
ill
try
it
next
time
im
over
there
and
see
if
there
is
any
difference
but
for
now
this
one
is
just
average
drank
several
bottles
at
a
bar
over
a
long
period
of
time
with
the
same
result
the
color
is
golden
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
head
is
creamy
and
of
medium
height
retention
is
okay
the
aroma
is
clean
i
was
expecting
skunk
from
the
green
bottle
sweet
grainy
smells
dominate
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
with
an
undercurrent
of
grainy
grassy
flavor
hop
flavor
most
noticed
at
the
beginning
of
a
sip
other
than
that
hop
presence
is
much
less
than
expected
from
a
pils
a
creamy
mouthfeel
is
a
plus
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
green
glass
eurostyle
longneck
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
this
came
fresh
on
tap
at
the
scottish
arms
it
poured
deep
straw
gold
and
was
topped
with
a
thick
white
champagne
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
noble
hops
all
flower
with
just
a
touch
of
citrus
taste
is
a
wonderful
hop
punch
not
overly
bitter
just
a
nice
fresh
hop
character
more
orange
citrus
light
slick
mouth
feel
very
quenching
this
was
the
2nd
time
id
enjoyed
this
beer
this
week
this
time
from
proper
glassware
nice
fluted
mug
rather
than
thick
glass
one
it
came
in
last
time
really
is
nice
to
enjoy
fresh
draft
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
really
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
definetly
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
yet
to
try
i
could
see
this
going
nicely
on
a
hot
summer
day
out
by
the
pool
well
worth
looking
into
overall
impression
very
drinkable
but
green
bottles
must
die
this
is
a
quaffable
import
lager
poured
out
to
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
and
medium
high
carbonation
some
traces
of
lace
in
the
glass
aromas
were
weak
but
notes
of
hops
and
grain
were
noted
taste
was
simple
yet
enjoyable
flavors
of
hops
and
grain
are
accented
by
the
mild
malt
that
is
not
too
thick
or
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
nice
crisp
and
light
while
still
maintaining
a
good
level
of
refreshing
depth
decent
drinkability
this
brew
would
be
best
consumed
with
some
chicken
or
pizza
or
as
a
summer
brew
i
think
i
may
find
myself
back
with
this
beer
toward
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
i
like
this
specifically
because
it
is
not
too
sweet
a
curse
of
too
many
standard
lagers
yeah
id
put
this
into
the
lager
category
rather
than
a
pilsner
i
could
definitely
session
this
so
i
learned
more
than
i
ever
though
about
burgerbrau
yesterday
gregg
glaser
the
news
editor
of
all
about
beer
magazine
asked
me
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
for
his
discussion
at
the
world
beer
festival
since
his
topic
was
beers
in
the
news
after
talking
to
the
southeast
us
representative
for
the
brewery
he
seemed
surprisingly
hesitant
to
offer
his
brew
up
after
talking
to
greg
he
explained
why
it
was
in
the
news
apparently
ab
is
suing
them
out
in
europe
for
their
use
of
the
word
budweiser
as
one
of
the
bs
he
seemed
cool
after
talking
to
greg
and
the
beer
actually
was
very
good
much
better
than
pilsner
urquell
beautifully
light
golden
with
excellent
carbonation
and
very
easy
to
drink
seemed
to
be
a
positive
experience
with
most
everyone
sitting
through
the
discussion
pours
golden
in
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
soon
fades
into
a
wispy
lace
nose
is
fresh
grains
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
a
mild
mustiness
and
earthiness
is
in
the
background
fairly
light
in
body
though
not
too
thin
taste
begins
with
lightly
sweet
malts
followed
by
grassy
hops
that
become
more
bitter
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
a
pretty
nice
pilsner
to
be
had
here
drinkability
was
pretty
good
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
if
i
liked
lagers
more
it
was
still
pretty
ok
the
demand
the
people
of
the
czech
republic
drink
more
beer
per
person
than
any
other
country
in
the
world
by
far
and
beer
is
an
integral
part
of
their
culture
they
continuously
set
the
highest
standards
for
the
quality
of
their
national
drink
the
mouth
is
weak
just
a
hair
above
water
drinkable
i
could
see
this
pairing
well
with
a
lot
of
different
dishes
but
overall
its
boring
and
i
would
rather
try
something
else
the
taste
is
great
a
nice
and
pleasant
floral
herbal
spicy
hop
with
very
little
bitterness
accompanied
by
a
delightful
sweetness
very
crisp
and
clean
and
insanely
drinkable
i
will
definitely
buy
more
of
this
particularly
when
in
the
company
of
swilldrinking
friends
this
beer
is
hard
to
find
on
ba
because
as
others
have
noted
the
us
import
bottles
list
a
diferent
brewery
all
together
thank
god
for
the
picture
of
the
bottle
anyway
the
beer
is
a
darn
nice
looking
very
gold
like
a
shiny
coin
since
i
poured
it
i
had
a
lovely
inch
of
creamy
white
foam
but
alas
where
did
it
go
aroma
is
probably
its
bext
feature
rich
bready
perfumey
tastewise
it
is
not
bad
maltyness
tingued
with
some
perfumey
hops
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
was
a
bit
noticeable
perhaps
a
touch
more
sharp
carbonation
would
have
evened
that
out
an
unexceptional
beer
resembling
pilsners
from
the
netherlands
or
denmark
more
than
a
hoppy
czech
pils
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
gold
color
with
copper
highlights
the
head
is
fairly
thin
frothy
and
a
pale
off
white
color
the
aroma
is
ever
so
slightly
skunked
and
has
notes
of
toasted
malt
and
lightly
spicy
hops
the
taste
is
fairly
thin
with
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
to
it
and
a
finish
that
spicy
herbal
and
a
bit
bitter
there
is
a
certain
bready
toasted
maltiness
here
though
it
is
competing
with
the
thin
wateriness
of
the
body
there
is
a
bit
of
light
struck
character
in
this
beer
as
well
though
it
is
not
all
that
strong
thankfully
this
is
actually
not
too
bad
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
was
hopping
for
a
czech
beer
nice
pours
a
clear
orange
gold
under
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
nose
is
nice
good
malt
and
flowery
hops
mix
the
mouth
is
light
and
prickly
theres
a
good
malt
opening
followed
by
a
mild
and
somewhat
metallic
hoppiness
mixed
in
here
is
more
sweet
than
i
would
have
expected
the
aftertaste
retains
some
of
the
mild
bitterness
but
fades
quickly
this
is
an
uninspired
brew
had
this
and
pilsner
urquell
in
prague
and
i
thought
pilsner
urquell
was
much
better
this
was
a
decent
substitute
though
a
pretty
average
beer
in
my
opinion
not
much
better
than
the
american
budweiser
this
beer
was
so
good
that
a
certain
american
brewer
stole
its
name
it
is
light
clean
and
crisp
with
light

the

wich
we
are
inclined
to
believe
this
is
a
special
batch
without
the
hops
we
have
in
memory
that
this
beer
is
more
hop
intensive
than
this
drinked
example
its
really
cool
to
finally
be
able
to
try
this
one
this
is
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
it
tasting
a
few
years
ago
in
the
us
i
do
enjoy
this
quite
a
bit
the
funkiness
is
by
no
means
overwhelming
but
it
is
not
a
world
class
beer
better
than
any
american
adjunct
lager
that
i
can
think
of
and
with
substantially
more
aromatics
and
character
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
as
a
beer
for
beers
sake
nothing
more
i
dont
have
any
notes
from
when
i
tried
this
beer
but
i
do
remember
it
being
a
good
example
of
a
pilsesner
i
can
recommend
for
anyone
who
enjoys
them
tasty
and
refreshing
albeit
rather
simple
on
the
whole
there
are
at
least
no
unwelcome
aspects
final
thoughts
all
in
all
a
good
pilsner
and
the
kind
of
beer
that
strikes
me
as
the
perfect
end
of
the
work
day
beer
make
no
mistake
though
theres
nothing
incredible
about
this
beer
its
just
a
well
made
simple
pilsner
for
quenching
your
thirst
and
easing
your
mind
its
a
good
lager
but
it
is
one
with
a
mass
produced
retail
quality
i
would
not
turn
it
down
nor
would
i
purposely
go
looking
for
it
it
sure
would
be
nice
to
have
a
fresh
version
of
this
beer
my
sample
is
fair
enough
but
one
has
no
idea
how
it
has
traveled
let
alone
when
it
was
brewed
and
bottled
still
it
retains
a
noble
hops
smell
and
taste
and
actually
leaves
a
slight
warm
bread
grain
flavor
which
is
quite
tasty
drinkable
and
preferable
to
an
american
budweiser
poured
from
can
aroma
is
grassy
hay
very
clear
golden
color
with
white
head
light
bitter
taste
light
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
crisp
lager
good
beer
the
fact
that
this
beer
and
style
are
so
neglected
in
the
u
s
is
really
a
shame
while
i
must
admit
that
i
drink
ales
almost
exclusively
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
i
have
had
it
on
tap
in
prague
and
throughout
europe
in
the
can
and
the
bottle
while
drinking
it
at
its
source
was
better
this
is
still
a
crisply
refreshing
but
spicy
and
complex
classic
out
of
the
bottle
or
can
i
strongly
disagree
with
most
of
the
reviews
here
this
is
the
czech
pilsner
i
first
had
this
beer
in
europe
where
they
called
it
budweiser
here
in
the
good
old
us
a
beer
that
has
been
made
for
hundreds
of
years
has
to
change
the
name
to
czechvar
because
of
corporate
lawsuits
anyway
this
is
a
great
beer
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
pilsner
a
little
malty
a
slight
bit
of
hoppiness
but
its
very
grassy
and
a
wonderful
summer
quaff
it
is
one
of
those
beers
you
could
session
easily
and
very
enjoyable
on
a
warm
summer
evening
although
its
not
really
that
way
at
the
moment
in
these
parts
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
beer
its
a
true
classic
overall
a
fine
quaffable
pilsner
apparently
overhyped
perhaps
owing
to
its
name
conflict
with
the
fizzy
american
swill
but
leaving
all
that
aside
its
still
a
quite
nice
pale
lager
in
its
own
right
overall
solid
beer
represents
the
style
well
prefer
czech
pils
to
german
as
they
showcase
the
hops
much
better
imho
czechvar
is
a
good
example
of
this
my
only
dislike
is
that
it
went
flat
fast
maybe
i
was
just
drinking
too
slow
i
know
thats
what
you
were
thinking
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
77
o
kind
of
disappointing
but
still
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
much
to
recommend
it
easier
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
pilsner
urquell
overall
in
my
mind
a
good
but
not
great
pilsner
definitely
not
preferred
to
pilsner
urquell
but
a
satisfying
beer
that
hits
the
spot
in
any
situation
o
overall
a
good
beer
id
say
this
is
a
great
selection
for
hot
weather
days
and
would
also
be
great
for
washing
down
a
meal
overall
good
but
not
outstanding
theres
nothing
especially
unique
about
this
beer
but
its
just
a
very
well
made
pilsener
thats
worlds
better
than
american
budweiser
o
good
lager
but
like
its
compatriot
urquell
not
really
living
up
to
its
name
o
this
is
not
a
style
ive
really
explored
and
i
was
all
set
for
a
one
dimentional
pilsner
but
instead
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
11
months
before
bbd
overall
i
remember
this
beer
as
budvar
when
i
was
in
slovakia
and
the
czech
republic
bottle
says
czechvar
but
it
is
still
the
same
beer
a
very
traditional
pilsner
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
bubbly
ring
on
top
skunk
hits
my
nose
as
soon
as
i
wrangle
the
cap
off
the
top
of
this
and
mostly
dissipates
as
my
beer
opens
up
spicy
floral
hops
and
sweet
bready
grainy
pilsner
malt
with
a
hint
of
rich
melanoidin
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
sharp
with
spicy
hop
flavor
balanced
by
a
honey
like
sweetness
wrapped
into
a
brown
bread
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
bubbly
mouthfeel
once
the
mercaptan
left
i
really
enjoyed
this
lager
o
give
me
a
pitcher
of
this
and
ill
be
set
for
about
15
minutes
thank
cripes
this
comes
in
cans
too
because
green
bottles
in
the
right
mood
and
setting
id
drink
this
over
bcbs
even
more
substantial
than
american
budweiser
drinkable
but
i
thought
this
would
be
much
more
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
just
wanted
it
to
be
a
classic
i
would
buy
it
again
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
this
is
an
ok
beer
while
it
beats
its
american
counterpart
under
the
same
name
its
just
not
a
great
european
beer
if
i
was
at
a
pub
i
cant
imagine
myself
ordering
it
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
it
wouldnt
be
a
choice
of
mine
the
taste
is
really
lacking
and
the
smell
if
average
reminds
me
of
pbr
which
i
happen
to
like
but
this
beer
costs
european
price
so
its
just
an
ok
beer
to
me
clear
pale
straw
colour
with
a
bubbly
fastreceding
head
aroma
of
honey
and
strongly
of
fresh
hops
balanced
flavour
begins
malty
and
sweet
fairly
lowly
carbonated
for
a
pilsner
finishes
with
a
soft
bitterness
slight
metallic
and
honey
notes
touch
of
caramel
very
clean
and
dry
finish
light
body
overall
quite
nice
completely
different
beer
from
the
american
one
with
the
same
name
although
i
already
knew
that
very
flavorful
and
tasty
refreshing
a
lot
like
most
of
the
czech
pilsners
i
found
in
prague
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
czech
notes
quite
pleasant
and
drinkable
much
better
than
our
american
named
counterpart
its
semisweetness
wins
over
my
sweet
tooth
and
this
is
the
czech
pilsner
beer
to
beat
in
my
eyes
light
but
in
a
good
way
it
still
retains
a
nice
flavor
and
is
devoid
of
any
offflavors
that
people
often
associate
with
lighter
massproduced
styles
very
clean
and
drinkable
appearance
was
way
off
for
me
though
freshly
cleaned
glass
too
poured
a
pretty
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
ring
of
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
about
par
for
a
pilsener
scents
of
lemon
and
grass
with
a
noticeable
sour
skunked
scent
about
what
i
expect
from
a
pilsener
it
would
be
a
bit
better
if
it
didnt
have
the
skunk
flavor
is
mild
with
an
upfront
hit
of
lemon
a
nice
mellow
hop
bitterness
sweet
pilsener
malt
and
some
light
grassy
hop
notes
nice
and
mild
one
note
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
it
tastes
like
a
good
pilsener
should
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
par
for
the
course
a
very
good
czech
pilsener
a
bit
stronger
a
showing
than
pilsener
urquell
and
nice
for
hot
weather
though
lagers
are
not
my
favourite
style
this
one
is
one
of
my
preferred
czech
lagerspilseners
moreover
its
available
at
an
attractive
price
which
makes
it
a
fine
everyday
beer
pours
out
a
light
golden
color
and
the
body
is
crystal
clear
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
light
white
head
the
head
quickly
thins
out
into
a
layer
of
fine
lacing
and
several
small
islands
of
bubbles
light
hops
and
malts
are
the
mainstay
of
its
aroma
there
is
a
slight
skunkiness
to
the
smell
this
had
me
concerned
but
there
is
no
sign
of
it
being
skunked
in
the
taste
its
light
bodied
crisp
and
mildly
bitter
as
you
swallow
the
hops
are
more
prevalent
in
the
taste
the
malts
take
a
back
seat
this
is
a
semidry
beer
sand
the
taste
gets
a
little
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
up
some
mild
fruits
do
come
through
along
with
some
lemon
and
grapefruit
zest
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
this
was
much
fresher
than
the
last
one
i
had
tasted
this
makes
a
whole
lots
of
difference
for
pilsners
this
one
was
not
metallic
i
found
this
very
well
balanced
and
pleasant
it
is
a
pity
that
the
fake
budweiser
is
not
as
good
as
this
one
this
is
a
true
pilsner
beer
second
only
to
pilsner
urquell
tasted
at
the
brewery
i
really
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
when
i
can
too
bad
it
is
not
reeally
available
in
america
because
of
the
trademark
problem
american
budweiser
has
ruined
the
reputation
of
this
brewery
and
its
wonderful
beer
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
time
i
can
visit
budvar
and
taste
this
beer
at
the
brewery
this
beer
is
truely
one
of
the
best
beers
in
its
class
in
the
world
when
in
germany
or
the
czech
republic
be
sure
to
try
one
of
these
and
you
too
will
be
a
fan
not
a
bad
beer
decent
for
the
price
i
guess
have
never
seen
this
in
my
area
so
bought
a
16
oz
can
when
i
travelled
to
ottawa
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
its
ok
didnt
have
the
bad
aftertaste
that
so
many
midlevel
beers
seem
to
have
nowadays
pretty
smooth
going
down
decent
flavor
o
one
of
the
best
pilseners
pours
clear
deep
golden
beer
sparkling
with
1finger
offwhite
head
distinctive
sweet
honey
and
floral
smell
clear
sweet
malty
taste
with
tones
of
manure
and
nice
herbal
bitter
finish
on
the
other
hand
wellbalanced
mediumbodied
classic
czech
pilsener
a
legend
of
the
style
not
bad
for
what
it
is
it
doesnt
foam
up
much
it
has
a
lovely
gold
color
its
neither
sour
nor
sweet
acceptable
but
not
remarkable
better
than
an
american
pale
lager
but
thats
a
low
bar
if
you
serve
this
to
idiots
they
will
think
its
really
fancy
i
just
wish
i
could
get
it
in
cans
its
only
sold
in
green
bottles
around
here
clearly
a
distinct
pilsner
nice
deep
golden
color
smells
floral
and
citrusy
nothing
special
there
taste
is
what
sets
this
beer
apart
from
most
other
european
pilsnerslagers
malty
sweetness
counterbalanced
by
citrusy
hoppiness
finishes
with
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
all
these
characteristics
are
more
pronounced
than
in
most
of
the
other
eastern
european
or
german
pilsners
very
smooth
and
drinkable
admittedly
i
had
some
better
craft
pilsners
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
macro
ones
and
surely
one
of
the
better
brews
available
in
sarajevo
this
is
what
a
pilsner
should
taste
like
its
approachable
easy
drinking
but
also
bold
and
flavorful
that
could
stand
on
its
own
against
any
hoppy
ale
malt
forward
bready
biscuit
cracker
slight
toasted

bitterness

i
love
this
worth
the
money
and
much
much
better
than
youknowwhat
overall
good
beer
surprising
to
be
honest
was
expecting
a
lightmacro
lager
thats
not
what
i
got
d
tons
of
drinkability
even
with
my
complaints
still
found
this
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
lager
cool
to
have
budvar
in
the
states
had
many
of
these
on
the
trains
between
cities
and
was
very
surprised
at
the
good
taste
one
two
three
and
more
and
more
try
it
if
your
lucky
enough
to
see
it
refreshing
clean
and
very
enjoyable
for
social
drinking
quite
common
in
the
area
and
cheap
czech
beer
in
my
opinion
is
some
of
the
finest
brew
in
the
world
even
if
its
brewed
by
bud
overall
a
very
good
session
lager
i
would
love
it
if
this
became
more
readily
available
at
a
low
price
here
in
the
netherlands
luckily
those
big
german
beerhalls
right
across
the
border
sell
this
stuff
for
the
same
price
as
our
supermarkets
sell
heineken
pilsener
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
genre
to
brew
well
for
the
brewer
has
nothing
to
hide
behind
no
barrels
and
barrels
of
hops
no
crazy
combinations
of
toasted
and
roasted
malts
no
high
abv
to
mask
off
flavors
in
every
10
czech
pilseners
i
may
find
one
that
is
worth
revisiting
budjejovickys
budvar
is
a
slightly
unique
wellbalanced
rendition
of
the
genre
that
has
made
it
onto
my
short
list
ill
be
revisiting
this
brew
soon
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
certainly
a
step
up
from
most
random
eurocans
you
find
on
shelves
here
in
ontario
i
am
editing
my
review
purchased
at
a
grocery
store
for
1
euro
in
salzburg
so
provided
this
doesnt
poison
me
there
is
value
for
the
money
drinking
out
of
a
can
so
no
opinion
on
color
or
head
expiry
date
that
says
good
for
another
10
months
so
that
is
good
i
did
spend
a
euro
the
smell
is
faintly
yeasty
and
grassy
but
nothing
overwhelming
the
taste
was
underwhelming
faint
hoppiness
but
overall
it
seems
to
taste
like
a
mass
produced
beer
like
dare
i
say
nothing
offensive
about
this
one
if
it
was
hot
out
and
this
was
cold
it
be
nice
i
was
disappointed
o
has
a
good
deal
of
flavor
a
bit
too
malty
but
a
very
solid
lager
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
that
im
sure
has
not
suffered
the
curse
of
the
green
bottle
i
still
prefer
the
new
packaged
pilsner
urquell
though
what
a
czech
pilsner
is
about
for
me
on
the
bigger
side
of
a
czech
pilsner
but
it
was
so
utterly
drinkable
this
is
just
one
of
those
beers
that
i
can
keep
on
drinking
til
the
cows
come
home
poured
into
a
becker
a
very
light
golden
with
a
nice
looking
fluffy
white
head
atop
aromas
were
grainy
and
lightly
toastednot
much
hop
presence
a
sturdy
fuller
feel
with
toasted
grain
flavors
and
mild
sweetness
a
classic
czech
lager
with
pretty
much
no
frills
but
its
better
than
most
if
not
all
american
macro
wanna
be
czech
lagers
out
there
edited
the
more
of
these
i
have
the
more
i
enjoy
them
but
if
you
like
this
type
of
beer
then
buy
it
and
drink
when
the
czechs
hit
the
soccer
pitch
this
week
for
the
fight
in
the
european
cup
football
games
this
month
overall
i
love
it
for
lack
of
better
terms
i
had
a
pesto
tomato
pizza
with
this
beer
i
like
this
beer
much
better
than
the
ubiquitous
pilsner
urquell
i
recommend
this
beer
it
is
my
favorite
international
pilsner
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
for
the
type
great
tasting
poor
appearance
though
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
beer
i
never
could
recognize
complexity
in
this
style
the
way
i
do
in
barleywines
or
stouts
it
is
refreshing
and
a
nice
pour
on
a
warm
afternoon
it
is
comparable
to
pilsner
urquell
and
perhaps
a
bit
superior
these
days
poured
into
a
shaker
glass
from
a
16
ounce
bottle
this
beer
appears
a
quite
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
half
inch
quickly
dissipating
white
head
the
smell
is
dominated
by
a
sweet
maltiness
with
a
nice
hop
aroma
this
is
a
very
crisp
and
clean
tasting
beer
i
suppose
that
there
is
some
bitterness
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
it
reminds
me
of
a
lovely
summer
evening
in
general
i
prefer
bolder
beers
but
then
again
im
american

from

notes
poured

hebrew
small
shaker
pint

decent

of

sweet

very

starts
adequatelywith
light
sweet

very
light

finishes
abruptly
with
a
faint
memory
of
malt
and
very
light
hops
not
memorable
or
worth
trying
again
sweet
malt
with
a
slight
diacetyl
note
which
is
covered
up
in
waves
of
saaz
spice
lovely
yeast
profile
with
hints
of
sulphur
sometimes
i
forget
how
many
ive
had
each
one
leads
to
another
so
easily
m
light
bodied
without
getting
too
watery
in
texture
highly
carbonated
o
nowhere
near
as
good
as
my
memory
of
the
tap
version
but
was
still
very
good
had
read
lots
of
stories
about
skunked
samples
but
this
one
seemed
nice
o
ultimately
this
beer
is
fair
to
middlin
for
its
weight
class
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
good
with
anything
salty
cheers
im
okay
with
this
one
but
it
doesnt
pump
me
up
pours
a
pretty
average
yellow
clear
colow
tih
no
head
smells
like
a
czech
malt
whatever
beer
taste
has
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
dustyn
old
malty
thing
going
on
but
i
am
uninspired
here
mouthfeel
is
light
as
can
be
and
minimally
bubbled
in
think
it
was
more
lively
from
the
bottle
but
this
is
very
average
as
far
as
czech
pilsners
go
urquell
is
still
supreme
drinkable
to
the
nines
but
bored
to
tears
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
czech
pilseners
would
be
an
awesome
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
i
went
to
the
store
to
buy
some
konig
only
to
discover
they
were
out
of
stock
i
paid
7
99
for
a
six
pack
of
czechvar
with
a
sell
by
date
of
101012
im
always
nervous
about
beer
in
green
bottles
but
i
figured
this
was
fresh
and
something
new
to
taste
the
beer
pours
with
a
clear
golden
color
and
about
1
finger
of
head
that
quickly
settles
i
think
this
beer
has
already
suffered
from
light
exposure
as
it
has
a
mild
case
of
the
skunks
going
i
imagine
it
smells
and
taste
much
better
from
a
tap
than
a
bottle
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
decent
for
the
style
but
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
smelly
i
wont
buy
it
again
i
am
sad
so
sad
that
the
times
ive
had
it
on
the
bottle
the
beer
was
skunked
it
did
not
taste
the
same
way
than
in
prague
thats
why
overall
this
beer
does
not
deserve
a
4
0
o
sure
not
the
most
complex
or
flavourful
beer
out
there
but
still
an
highly
drinkable
perfectly
balanced
and
absolutety
flawless
one
a
classic
in
its
sheer
simplicity
very
clean
taste
and
smell
was
simple
white
head
of
two
fingers
in
height
with
moderate
lacing
didnt
detect
any
hopping
but
did
sense
the
pine
after
taste
a
good
beer
and
a
would
try
again
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
the
taste
was
pilsnerstyle
hoppy
and
dry
with
a
distinctly
skunky
taste
i
can
never
be
sure
if
thats
from
improper
storage
or
just
a
lame
beer
but
ill
alter
my
review
if
my
next
bottle
is
not
skunky
this
was
pretty
lame
no
better
than
american
lager
that
said
i
can
still
enjoy
these
from
time
to
time
330ml
bottle
poured
into
leffe
chalice
golden
colour
head
was
small
and
faded
fast
no
lacing
clear
aroma
was
parmesan
chesse
and
red
cabbage
which
to
me
suggested
the
use
of
saaz
hops
tasted
grass
and
earth
finish
was
slightly
earthy
and
bitter
less
carbonated
than
i
expected
texture
slightly
thick
smooth
passable
as
a
czech
pils
but
could
have
been
more
interesting
rjt
pours
a
light
gold
that
is
as
clear
as
purified
water
very
lightly
carbonated
nice
thinnish
white
head
smell
is
bitter
and
a
bit
like
citrus
sitting
on
top
of
the
malt
first
taste
is
sweet
and
upfront
and
gets
bitter
at
the
end
a
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
body
beer
with
decent
carbonation
overall
this
is
better
than
american
budweiser
and
would
be
ok
to
session
o
the
beer
has
surprised
me
qua
taste
you
can
totally
not
compare
it
with
the
american
version
this
is
much
nicer
ogood
beer
that
seems
to
be
well
balanced
its
definitely
less
harsh
than
many
european
lagers
this
is
much
better
than
the
macros
of
europe
its
nice
crisp
and
clean
less
hoppy
than
many
other
pilsners
that
ive
had
but
still
fun
to
drink
o
during
my
beer
tour
i
only
had
this
prima
pils
and
lagunitas
pils
this
pulled
out
ahead
which
i
wasnt
expecting
overall
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
lager
that
is
a
wellrounded
representative
of
the
style
maybe
it
will
be
in
my
fridge
but
it
is
doubtful
food
match
goes
with
steak
well
done
and
beerbattered
fries
or
for
the
vegetarian
option
a
lentil
burger
and
fries
would
work
just
as
well
nothing
too
challenging
in
the
flavour
department
id
love
to
try
it
from
the
source
someday
overall
an
excellent
sampling
of
a
pilsner
will
definitely
go
back
to
this
one
again
in
finishing
ill
say
that
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
but
not
because
i
thought
it
was
interesting
or
made
me
grow
as
a
beer
drinker
rather
that
im
a
sucker
for
seltzer
water
so
the
light
refreshingness
of
this
guy
mixed
with
its
bubblyness
contented
me
not
sure
how
old
this
is
overall
less
than
expected
the
low
carbonation
and
finish
was
a
let
down
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
in
prague
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
czech
pilsner
but
it
kind
of
lacks
any
distinguishing
qualities
its
really
refreshing
though
and
id
consider
getting
it
again
final
grade
3
58
a
b
overall
kind
of
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
didnt
feel
like
i
was
drinking
a
good
quality
european
beer
will
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
just
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
apple
overall
a
decent
pilsener
but
not
all
that
great
even
then
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
random
thin
broken
rings
of
lace
form
here
and
there
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
grains
grass
and
a
funky
sundried
lemon
aroma
taste
is
of
grains
and
grassyherbal
flavors
there
is
a
distinct
metallic
taste
in
this
one
too
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
flat
feeling
with
an
almost
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
pretty
much
all
the
way
around
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
too
much
but
i
am
glad
i
picked
one
up
to
try
the
budweiser
from
europe
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
lively
and
highlights
the
flavours
of
the
brew
all
in
all
a
great
pils
but
not
something
to
search
too
hard
for
prefer
urquell
i
can
find
this
for
under
8
euro
an
8
pack
in
the
grocery
store
here
in
italy
because
of
the
lack
of
appropriate
choices
this
is
a
gold
standard
of
awesomeness
for
the
pricepoint
a
real
pilsner
is
hard
to
come
by
here
so
budvar
is
greatly
appreciated
i
cant
say
whether
or
not
ill
ever
buy
this
again
as
there
are
other
pilsners
that
pack
a
little
more
punch
flavourwise
but
those
looking
for
a
nice
smooth
refreshing
summer
beer
that
goes
down
easy
but
still
tastes
like
beer
definitely
give
it
a
shot
o
great
example
of
a
classic
style
one
that
i
never
have
a
problem
going
back
too
overall
easy
to
drink
more
malty
than
average
of
the
three
my
order
of
preference
is
1
pilsner
urquel
2
czechvar
and
3
summit
bohemian
style
pilsner
the
summit
and
czechvar
are
so
close
that
it
comes
down
to
a
matter
of
preferences
if
you
want
a
little
more
of
the
bohemian
malt
flavor
and
saaz
hops
then
go
with
the
czechvar
taste
wise
i
think
the
czechvar
wins
but
if
appearance
is
more
important
to
you
go
with
the
summit
if
you
want
a
cleaner
tasting
lawn
mower
beer
the
summit
is
great
cold
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
very
clear
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
when
it
goes
away
there
is
no
lacing
you
do
get
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
from
the
beer
the
smell
is
crisp
and
nice
a
little
floral
hops
sweet
bread
malt
and
grassy
undertones
the
mouth
feel
is
as
expected
light
and
crisp
with
tingly
carbonation
the
taste
is
good
it
has
some
malty
notes
up
front
with
a
little
bitterness
on
the
way
down
although
its
also
a
little
watery
for
my
taste
overall
a
decent
beer
very
crisp
and
refreshing
so
its
probably
go
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
its
too
watery
for
my
tastes
there
are
several
other
beers
i
prefer
over
this
in
this
style
taste
sweet
pilsner
malt
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
herbal
noble
hops
a
touch
on
the
wwtery
side
but
good
first
off
much
better
than
the
king
of
beers
its
no
contest
nice
looking
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
quick
foam
that
disappears
rather
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
lace
smell
is
crisp
taste
has
a
hint
of
hops
sweetness
feels
much
better
than
average
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
nice
and
easy
overall
a
disappointment
this
is
i
feel
this
beer
is
overhyped
would
gladly
have
again
if
given
the
chance
fact
is
there
a
many
better
beers
offered
from
the
region
i
have
to
go
with
the
consensus
this
really
is
a
nice
pilsener
from
the
green
bottle
dated
03
14
12
sampled
on
june
9
2011
yes
it
is
too
bad
it
came
in
a
green
botle
because
that
inevitable
skunkiness
reared
its
ugly
head
or
ugly
nostril
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
foil
covered
cap
the
pour
was
straw
yellow
with
no
head
at
all
and
dead
carbonation
it
was
difficult
to
catch
anything
special
in
the
aroma
maybe
a
little
hoppy
thing
the
body
was
thin
there
were
bits
of
malts
and
hops
in
the
taste
but
my
particular
bottle
was
skunked
to
the
max
so
it
was
hard
to
give
it
a
fair
rating
had
to
try
it
i
had
heard
about
the
czech
budweiser
and
when
i
came
across
this
i
picked
one
up
even
though
i
was
curious
i
figured
i
knew
what
the
outcome
would
be
its
a
generic
looking
pilsner
with
a
yellow
body
white
head
not
much
lacing
if
any
really
the
smell
is
a
of
some
malts
grains
grass
and
other
earthy
aromas
the
taste
followed
through
with
some
of
the
aromas
but
also
has
a
decent
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
all
in
all
still
nothing
to
rave
about
this
has
got
to
be
good
canned
hopefully
eliminating
all
skunking
issues
budvarczechvar
pours
an
absolute
pristine
goldenrod
its
like
looking
through
yellow
tinted
glass
theres
about
a
finger
of
clean
white
foam
topping
the
beer
it
manages
to
stick
around
for
a
minute
or
two
but
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
subpar
at
best
it
basically
smells
like
sulfer
and
skunked
beer
i
think
theres
a
faint
bit
of
floral
hoppiness
in
there
as
well
but
its
so
far
in
the
background
that
its
barely
perceptible
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
polished
as
sulfer
and
skunk
sink
back
into
minor
supporting
roles
theres
a
solid
bready
malt
presence
and
herbal
noble
hop
notes
as
well
the
body
is
appropriately
light
and
spry
and
the
carbonation
is
subtly
bubbly
im
still
not
a
big
fan
of
pilseners
in
general
and
especially
ones
produced
on
a
macro
scale
but
this
is
one
of
the
more
tolerable
ones
ive
tried
o
drinkable
smooth
and
flavorful
this
is
a
great
summer
starter
o
overall
a
very
good
drinker
i
think
i
actually
like
the
hop
balance
better
in
the
budvar
than
in
urquell
these
days
the
budvar
allows
a
good
flavor
of
malts
through
to
the
palate
best
pilsner
ive
had
if
you
see
it
get
it
id
have
2
or
3
more
right
now
a
decent
well
rounded
lager
the
flavour
is
uncomplicated
but
refreshing
and
the
mouthfeel
is
good
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
one
that
im
happy
to
drink
repeatedly
o
decent
enough
goes
down
fast
overall
a
good
introductory
lager
solid
formula
excellent
appearance
and
taste
crisp
and
clean
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
dvery
highly
drinkable
i
enjoy
the
carbonation
level
on
this
one
and
appreciate
it
compared
to
other
czechstyle
pils
o
fantastic
beer
top
of
my
list
for
pilsners
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
budweiser
really
did
a
good
job
on
this
one
my
opinion
great
beer
however
the
presentation
of
the
can
gets
an
average
due
to
the
simplicity
of
such
a
complex
beer
but
all
that
is
shadowed
by
the
taste
and
the
feel
it
leaves
in
the
mouth
which
is
simply
put
exemplary
overallwhats
not
to
love
nothing
off
light
and
refreshing
great
for
hot
weather
and
a
perfect
accompaniment
for
just
about
any
food
if
only
all
lagers
could
be
this
tasty
between
urquell
and
czechvar
i
believe
that
pilsner
urquell
gets
my
vote
tastes
like
a
tad
more
hops
and
that
appeals
to
me
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
if
you
want
a
lawnmower
beer
but
with
a
bit
more
taste
and
complexity
i
would
much
rather
drink
this
then
a
coors
or
bud
or
any
other
macro
beer
for
that
matter
not
the
best
pilsner
but
not
a
bad
one
either
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
d
very
id
have
another
anyday
its
a
pretty
decent
if
not
average
beer
interesting
worth
checking
out
but
not
likely
to
be
a
session
beer
interesting
how
much
a
difference
2
years
makes
i
really
enjoyed
the
original
budweiser
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
awhile
poured
from
330
ml
bottle
into
my
pilsner
glass
approx
1
inch
of
fluffy
white
head
dissipated
quickly
with
little
or
no
lacing
clear
rich
golden
nectar
truly
the
worlds
finest
budweiser
the
skunky
malty
smell
tugs
at
my
nose
hairs
it
is
the
finest
of
pilseners
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
epitomizes
the
style
nice
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
drinkability
iswell
i
could
session
three
or
four
with
no
problem
i
hope
my
view
isnt
skewed
after
so
many
strong
imperial
stouts
and
hopped
up
ipas
ive
had
some
czech
pilsners
that
i
like
in
the
past
this
just
isnt
one
of
them
taste
refreshing
zesty
almost
lemon
like
resonance
very
light
lemon
dont
want
you
to
think
its
anywhere
near
substantial
prickly
carbonation
not
much
else
to
taste
tastes
like
adjunct
beer
id
tell
someone
to
just
get
the
king
of
beers
budweiser
its
cheaper
and
not
substantially
different
than
what
you
get
here
had
it
in
a
bottle
ive
had
it
a
bunch
while
in
europe
a
nice
reminder
how
great
beer
was
over
there
i
really
love
the
aftertaste
on
the
beer
d
i
was
surprised
that
this
may
be
a
bud
product
as
it
was
not
very
good
in
any
aspect
d
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
sorta
upset
this
was
an
incogneito
beer
taste
is
much
approved
a
simple
bready
malt
feel
and
faint
wet
crisp
mouthfeel
this
could
be
a
little
more
sharp
and
crisp
i
think
but
ill
take
it
tonic
water
taste
and
bread
clean
finishing
really
easy
drinking
inexpensive
as
well
to
boot
those
three
things
make
for
very
high
drinkability
d
well
besides
the
smell
this
brew
is
crisp
and
refreshing
i
oughta
try
this
one
out
of
a
can
the
green
bottle
really
ruins
things
well
what
can
i
say
this
was
horrid
and
depressing
you
got
flavor
only
when
you
attacked
the
beer
in
its
initial
pour
which
is
great
if
you
chugged
it
in
that
first
go
overall
disappointment
but
what
do
i
expect
from
the
big
name
brewer
taste
is
a
lot
better
then
it
smells
it
has
a
lemon
zing
but
a
bitter
brisk
very
crisp
drinking
style
typical
of
most
lagers
d
okay
this
is
a
one
and
done
tried
this
from
a
friend
and
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
very
average
pours
a
light
gold
that
is
as
clear
as
purified
water
very
lightly
carbonated
nice
thinnish
white
head
smell
is
bitter
and
a
bit
like
citrus
sitting
on
top
of
the
malt
first
taste
is
sweet
and
upfront
and
gets
bitter
at
the
end
a
good
beer
the
beerhunter
was
correct
in
saying
this
is
what
budweiser
is
and
would
taste
like
if
only
the
megaamerican
brewer
would
focus
on
quality
over
quantity
this
one
would
session
quite
well
in
the
summer
with
some
mild
food
pours
a
goldentan
body
with
small
head
and
little
retention
thereof
smells
crisp
and
malty
slightly
metallic
tastes
very
crisp
clean
almost
a
lighter
pilsener
urquell
not
too
hoppy
but
enough
of
a
bite
to
give
you
a
slightly
spicy
impression
its
a
nice
light
beer
nothing
too
special
but
quite
enjoyable
nevertheless
this
is
a
beer
i
would
buy
if
i
wanted
quality
and
quantity
at
the
same
time
overall
how
in
the
hell
can
a
b
say
they
have
the
same
recipe
this
lager
is
crisp
flavorful
and
drinkable
a
perfect
companion
for
my
sausage
and
sauerkraut
lunch
on
a
mild
czech
summer
day
this
will
probably
be
the
brew
by
which
i
will
judge
all
other
pilsners
not
a
bad
lager
just
rather
average
in
the
end
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
good
enough
though
for
sloshing
back
a
grilled
cheese
sandwich
a
burger
and
fries
or
any
other
plainjane
repast
drinkable
that
is
what
this
style
is
all
about
several
bottles
the
fresher
the
better
clear
light
golden
thin
white
head
nice
wholesome
grains
light
soft
sweetness
on
the
nose
clean
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
as
a
good
pilsner
should
be
this
one
ends
clean
and
a
tiny
bit
grassy
tight
soft
snappy
and
one
of
my
favorite
goto
pilsners
d
very
enjoyable
beer
more
bitter
than
i
was
expecting
so
it
was
a
surprise
but
all
in
all
a
very
good
czech
pills
if
i
could
find
it
all
the
time
i
would
have
this
in
my
refrigerator
247
a
delicious
delicious
beer
i
think
this
is
my
new
benchmark
for
what
a
czech
pils
ought
to
be
drinkability
im
in
no
hurry
to
have
another
but
im
not
going
to
spit
it
out
like
most
american
macrolagers
go
buy
some
of
argentinas
favorite
beer
and
leave
this
on
the
shelf
d
a
quafable
beer
it
is
nice
to
have
a
pilsner
that
doesnt
taste
like
water
good
all
malt
pilsner
3
5
overall
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
mouthfeel
is
good
soft
but
with
a
refreshing
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
just
ok
its
goes
down
easy
enough
but
im
not
interested
enough
to
have
another
dvery
sessionable
nothing
uninviting
here
a
godo
refreshing
but
not
too
dry
beer
great
drinkability
and
something
i
would
buy
again
mouthfeel
it
is
light
refreshing
and
crisp
it
leaves
a
smouth
finish
that
invite
another
mouthful
it
is
so
crisp
that
regular
beer
drinkers
would
love
and
beer
lovers
can
dig
into
taste
is
delectable
its
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
its
creamy
and
sweet
with
a
nice
hop
bite
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
and
thick
but
still
very
crisp
deep
gold
in
colour
brilliant
clarity
poorly
retained

fluffy
head
no

restrained
scent
clean

malt
flavour
grassyspicy
hops
hint
of
lemon
soft
bitterness
crisp
finish
light
bodied
with
spritzy
carbonation
this
classic
czech
pils
is
pretty
good
but
i
prefer
pilsner
urquell
drink
just
an
average
beer
in
my
books
not
something
id
seek
out
again
t
with
bitter
taste
beginning
to
end
with
a
long
finish
and
most
bitter
dgood
but
really
lacks
character
and
depth
refreshing
nothing
off
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
think
there
are
better
choices
out
there
pours
a
strawyellow
with
thin
white
head
not
too
much
in
way
of
head
retention
or
lacing
smell
is
grassy
hops
and
grainy
malt
flavour
has
a
little
bit
of
the
grassy
hop
bitterness
with
a
sweet
malt
nothing
too
exciting
about
this
but
it
is
pleasant
to
drink
a
little
bit
prickly
carbonation
but
still
quite
drinkable
on
a
warm
day
clear
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
sulphur
and
light
malt
taste
is
sweet
maltiness
up
front
with
a
sulphur
euro
lager
middle
and
a
earthy
grassy
finish
lower
bitterness
levels
than
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
average
average
carbonation
good
drinkability
light
and
refreshing
slightly
above
average
czech
pils
probably
the
best
of
budweisers
offerings
ive
ever
had
im
a
little
miffed
at
the
price
but
the
beer
isnt
bad
at
all
if
it
were
priced
more
reasonably
id
buy
it
more
often
it
does
leave
me
wanting
another
purely
for
the
quality
of
the
beer
tho
d
this
can
be
enjoyed
in
all
seasons
as
it
provides
a
thirst
quenching
aspect
to
it
chechvar
has
a
decent
drinkability
i
prefer
pilsner
urquell
to
this
but
its
still
a
tasty
lager
pours
a
nice
crisp
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
has
average
retention
the
aroma
is
one
dominated
by
sweet
corn
with
a
touch
of
sweet
corn
beneath
it
the
beers
flavours
are
dominated
by
a
lingering
vegetal
funk
a
spicy
bitterness
and
the
corn
great
carbonation
for
the
style
feels
very
crisp
a
good
drink
hampered
by
some
odd
lingering
funk
drinkability
light
crisp
flavorful
overall
enjoyable
slainte
everytime
i
have
an
imported
czech
pilsner
its
like
looking
at
a
dirty
magazine
with
all
the
good
bits
blacked
out
you
know
it
could
be
good
if
you
could
just
see
it
in
all
its
glory
this
is
still
6
months
away
from
its
best
before
which
is
fresher
than
most
urquells
we
get
but
its
on
its
downward
spiral
a
fairly
uninteresting
nose
of
basic
graininess
and
only
the
slightest
hint
of
floral
spice
unfortunately
in
equal
parts
of
skunk
coming
up
leads
to
a
surprisingly
fresh
light
mouthfeel
overall
its
quite
pleasant
and
id
take
this
over
the
dodgy
pilsner
urquells
i
spot
in
most
bottle
shops
but
i
think
fresh
on
tap
in
its
homeland
this
baby
would
just
sing
this
beer
is
prettier
on
draft
ill
tell
you
that
mostly
there
are
head
issues
here
its
short
and
shortlived
a
mess
of
fizz
where
there
should
be
a
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
lovely
and
fruitysweet
full
of
honey
italian
bitters
ripe
pear
and
orange
blossom
softly
effervescent
and
nicely
balanced
on
the
palate
with
restrained
lemony
and
slightly
leafy
bitterness
bouncing
off
a
cushion
of
sweetly
soured
grain
complex
it
aint
but
drinkable
it
certainly
is
m
d
light
drinkable
refreshing
but
without
distinct
character
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
degree
of
carbonation
to
it
giving
the
beer
a
crisp
quality
drinkability
is
fine
as
this
beer
goes
down
quite
easily
nice
thirst
quencher
and
probably
a
nice
complement
to
lighter
foods
but
not
the
most
complex
and
flavorful
pilsner
i
have
had
good
czech
pilsener
to
start
and
being
in
a
can
doesnt
hurt
it
d
a
well
made
pils
for
sure
but
no
where
near
as
good
as
urquel
nonetheless
give
this
one
a
shot
d
one
of
the
best
czech
pilseners
ive
ever
had
bottle
serving
a
pleasantly
refreshing
beer
which
i
have
enjoyed
many
many
times
the
joys
of
spending
ten
years
living
in
the
czech
republic
budvar
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
mass
produced
beers
the
czech
have
to
offer
and
is
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
micro
brewers
as
well
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
nice
hoppy
pilsner
flavor
50cl
can
picked
this
up
in
a
food
store
in
france
this
one
poured
a
clear
vivid
golden
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
white
head
on
it
but
it
didnt
linger
at
all
grassy
aroma
with
some
faint
malts
in
the
background
some
malts
to
the
taste
with
a
grassiness
to
the
taste
slightly
lighter
body
just
a
touch
bitter
a
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
beer
d
super
drinkable
could
easily
down
a
good
amount
in
a
session
this
beer
is
light
but
loaded
with
flavor
a
very
good
lager
excellent
for
a
summer
barbecue
and
one
i
would
definitely
have
again
light
amber
color
but
still
a
nose
pilsener
however
noted
by
the
lime
but
also
very
pleasant
mild
mile
the
palate
does
not
disappoint
and
offers
several
flavors
and
a
presence
and
a
creamy
finish
slightly
malty
midway
between
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
and
spicy
lemon
zest
which
are
present
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
taste
this
is
really
quite
good
and
i
dont
think
im
giving
more
than
a
tenth
of
a
point
or
so
for
being
a
noncraptastic
budweiser
o
solid
refreshing
and
down
the
middle
this
beer
isnt
terrible
nor
is
it
great
though
id
wouldnt
refuse
another
the
perceived
sourness
overpowering
the
hopgrain
flavors
are
too
much
for
me
to
session
this
the
similarities
to
becks
i
found
interesting
considering
that
its
probably
been
at
least
78
years
since
i
had
a
becks
im
sure
its
better
over
in
its
homeland
dexceedingly
drinkable
could
carry
for
a
fullon
session
one
of
the
great
bohemian
pilsners
if
youre
looking
for
a
slightly
less
bitter
pilsener
with
still
enough
hops
to
let
you
know
it
is
a
pilsener
this
is
the
beer
for
you
d
goes
down
ok
not
filling
an
ok
representation
of
the
style
ive
had
some
really
good
czech
pilsners
that
i
would
opt
for
over
this
another
green
bottle
from
overseas
another
beer
thats
a
bit
of
a
skunkaroo
drinkability
this
is
an
authentic
but
basic
example
of
the
style
its
pretty
good
i
guess
overall
but
the
style
has
better
options
in
my
opinion
the
beer
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
good
head
and
carbonation
the
aroma
was
light
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
was
clean
and
refreshing
it
went
down
smooth
with
an
easy
finish
this
is
very
drinkable
as
i
had
a
number
of
these
while
relaxing
to
the
music
d
very
drinkable
much
moreso
than
the
budweiser
we
get
here
in
the
states
refreshing
and
crisp
though
somewhat
mediocre
for
the
style
but
better
than
many
euro
lagers
id
love
to
try
this
in
the
can
for
comparison
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
tastes
great
and
i
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
great
kind
of
beer
for
gulping
down
with
your
food
o
very
good
drinkability
not
as
good
as
urquell
but
still
a
classic
czech
pilsener
chechvar
has
a
decent
drinkability
i
prefer
pilsner
urquell
to
this
but
its
still
a
tasty
lager
very
drinkable
very
tasty
a
definite
recommendation
for
the
budvarczechvar
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pretty
good
czech
pilsner
that
you
can
find
most
anywhere
taste
strikes
a
pretty
even
balance
between
floral
herbaceous
hops
and
the
light
barely
sweet
malt
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
spicy
hop
bite
deliciously
smooth
but
i
cant
help
but
think
this
is
a
shell
of
its
fresher
self
with
the
green
bottles
and
long
journey
across
the
pond
good
beer
and
the
quality
is
evident
but
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
fresh
from
the
source
as
with
most
pilsners
this
one
is
extremely
quaffable
i
am
usually
reluctant
to
purchase
imports
in
green
bottles
but
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
could
drink
this
fairly
endlessly
it
goes
down
easy
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
for
sure
happy
to
drink
it
again
but
i
wont
be
scrambling
to
find
it
poured
into
beer
mug
the
beer
appears
to
be
a
golden
color
with
white
head
and
very
little
retention
there
is
a
very
skunky
smell
to
this
beer
that
i
cant
get
over
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
small
bit
of
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
crisp
overall
the
green
bottle
just
kills
its
drinkability
notes
good
mouthfeel
which
for
me
is
just
a
good
level
of
carbonation
drinkability
quite
a
tasty
beer
and
defied
my
expectations
of
it
based
on
similar
beers
in
the
style
i
dont
know
that
i
would
be
drinking
it
all
night
long
but
it
sure
beats
the
massproduced
american
lager
that
misappropriated
its
namesake
note
i
occasionally
find
the
usa
bottled
version
czechvar
around
my
area
and
i
do
drink
it
its
a
bit
different
to
me
or
at
least
i
think
it
is
i
think
anything
tastes
better
in
its
native
region
but
that
could
be
psychological
d
despite
some
imperfections
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
chose
it
over
pilsner
urquell
much
less
some
of
the
better
american
craft
pilsners
but
definitely
worth
drinking
if
offered
very
nice
and
drinkable
i
wish
the
american
bud
was
this
good
otherwise
its
very
average
the
smell
is
lemony
the
taste
is
caramel
and
lemon
with
a
grain
finish
the
hops
are
present
but
not
doing
much
so
its
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
its
creamy
and
drinkable
but
not
complex
in
the
least
drinkablity
i
can
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
in
one
night
it
pairs
well
with
light
fare
like
lime
chicken
and
sandwiches
no
pleasant
i
must
say
after
drinking
primarily
munich
helles
the
last
month
i
lean
a
bit
more
in
the
favor
of
the
helles
for
its
higher
level
of
maltymineral
complexity
but
this
is
really
a
decent
brew
i
will
buy
this
again
d
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
in
the
spring
or
summertime
very
refreshing
personally
i
would
chose
something
like
a
witber
over
czech
pilsners
on
a
warm
day
but
this
would
do
great
as
an
alternative
nonetheless
this
is
certainly
an
easy
drinking
pilsener
but
id
hesitate
to
put
it
in
the
same
class
as
urquell
the
green
bottle
certainly
raises
a
concern
for
freshness
but
even
with
what
i
believe
is
a
reasonably
fresh
sample
it
seems
to
lack
the
vibrancy
and
finesse
of
the
other
brew
sidebyside
this
seems
more
workaday
but
that
doesnt
stop
it
from
being
a
refreshing
option
when
the
sun
is
blazing
down
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
years
i
guess
like
everyone
i
was
intrigued
by
the
anheuserbusch
controversy
plus
i
really
like
european
lagers
i
personally
think
urquell
is
a
beautiful
beer
the
only
other
czech
beer
ive
had
this
also
is
a
pretty
dam
fine
lager
probably
not
as
good
as
urquell
but
still
pretty
good
if
youre
a
fan
of
euro
lagers
like
i
am
you
will
like
this
one
very
drinkable
good
session
beer
i
didnt
mind
this
at
all
moderately
flavored
with
a
crisp
and
thirst
quenching
nature
about
it
i
could
down
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
no
problem
still
not
my
favorite
but
a
nice
easy
drinking
pilsner
usually
fairly
cheap
at
the
lcbo
i
say
go
for
it
overall
not
as
clean
as
pilsner
urquell
has
more
of
a
bite
and
grassy
taste
freshness
presumably
not
an
issue
notes

pilsener
for
a
pilsner
this
really
is
the
icing
the
original
and
what
most
others
are
held
against
in
comparison
purposes
aroma
is
of
malt
and
hop
pours
a
clear
golden
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
taste
is
great
malt
and
hop
in
the
taste
with
a
little
bitter
aftertaste
is
just
wonderful
this
brings
be
back
to
prague
where
i
downed
quite
a
number
of
these
pints
hopefully
will
get
back
there
again
this
time
to
visit
the
brewery
500ml

hue
with
a
thin
ring

some
speckles

cling
to

wheaty

malt
fresh

grassy
saaz
hops

more

in

crisp
and
refreshing
with
lots
of
peppery
bite
from
the
hops
not
much
to
this
one
just
a
lovely
wellcrafted
pils
i
could
drink
this
by
the
gallon
easy
drinking
with
a
slightly
thin
watery
mouth
feel
a
good
beer
good
over
all
balance
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
it
seems
like
just
a
slight
upgrade
from
a
typical
fizzy
yellow
beer
but
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
taste
slight
sweetness
that
fades
quickly
into
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
very
nice
pilsner
flavor
i
could
do
a
couple
bottles
of
this
stuff
its
not
heavy
very
quenching
and
would
be
a
good
patio
quaff
leaves
me
wanting
more
d
not
bad
i
like
that
i
can
actually
taste
some
hops
in
this
beer
as
for
drinkability
its
fine
itd
be
easy
to
put
a
couple
of
these
down
if
they
were
handy
d4

i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
but
its
just
nothing
special
when
i
need
a
pils
fix
ill
stick
with
the
german
options
drinkability
exceedingly
refreshing
czech
pils
with
a
much
better
than
expected
malt
body
could
have
used
a
touch
more
bitterness
for
balance
but
that
is
a
very
minor
complaint
until
i
retry
pilsner
urquell
this
is
my
favorite
czech
pilsner
edit
this
is
definitely
better
than
pilsner
urquell
a
i
was
a
little
confused
by
this
one
not
the
beer
but
all
the
names
attached
too
it
its
good
too
know
all
the
people
who
order
a
budweiser
overseas
might
drink
a
decent
beer
unexpectedly
i
think
im
going
to
go
back
and
purchase
it
d
an
outstanding
session
lager
leagues
ahead
of
that
other
budweiser
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
very
much
like
to
try
these
near
the
source
i
suspect
it
would
be
excellent
d
drinkable
but
only
one
per
evening
drinkability
worth
a
try
fairly
tasty
easily
drinkable
its
a
nice
little
beer
quite
drinkable
if
only
american
budweiser
was
as
good
as
this
drinkability
i
wouldnt
want
another
from
this
batch
but
ill
give
it
a
second
shot
soon
overall
by
far
my
favorite
czech
pilsener
now
if
only
the
american
budweiser
was
like
this
id
be
drinking
it
all
the
time
a
great
and
inexpensive
beer
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
when
first
pouring
the
beer
out
the
amount
of
foam
that
it
gave
off
was
a
good
inch
and
a
half
the
aroma
is
a
skunky
aroma
that
greets
the
nose
the
coloration
of
the
beer
is
that
of
a
yellowed
brown
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
the
skunky
taste
but
also
has
tones
of
a
hoppiness
overall
a
decent
beer
for
the
summer
months
d
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
i
suppose
but
if
i
had
to
choose
id
take
the
pilsner
urquell
i
got
tired
of
smelling
the
skunkiness
in
the
czechvar
every
time
i
had
a
sip
the
pilsner
urquell
by
comparison
was
less
skunky
to
begin
with
and
lost
the
smell
after
a
while
it
also
had
that
slightly
sweet
component
of
taste
which
balanced
the
hoppiness
nicely
drinkability
like
a
good
pilsner
this
rates
pretty
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
though
i
might
get
tired
of
the
skunk
smell
each
time
i
open
a
bottle
yeah
its
a
good
enough
beer
and
ill
bet
it
really
shines
when
fresh
but
its
not
something
i
see
myself
rushing
back
to
drink
again
d
while
this
beer
isnt
terrible
it
certainly
doesnt
warrant
mass
consumption
and
i
certainly
wont
be
getting
it
again
but
its
refreshing
for
the
timebeing
and
drinkable
at
lease
i
liked
it
reminds
me
of
my
time
spent
working
and
drinking
in
emea
if
you
have
friends
that
claim
to
not
care
what
theyre
drinking
hand
them
one
of
these
they
will
see
the
light
the
nose
wasnt
strong
but
clean
like
the
taste
the
most
prominent
taste
was
that
of
hops
and
a
less
prominent
taste
of
malt
and
floral
flavor
it
wasnt
bitter
at
all
its
one
of
those
beers
that
make
you
want
to
take
another
sip
also
it
was
more
on
the
thin
side
but
not
completely
i
would
recommend
this
beer
i
didnt
have
another
one
because
i
wanted
to
try
mack
a
norwegian
beer
which
is
brewed
in
the
northernmost
brewery
in
the
world
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
one
inch
of
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
strong
unmistakable
aroma
of
saaz
hops
spicy
and
herbal
in
quality
the
hops
bring
it
in
the
flavor
as
well
with
a
potent
herbal
component
the
malt
really
does
not
play
a
part
in
the
flavor
bitterness
is
high
for
a
typical
pilsener
finishes
extremely
dry
i
like
my
pilseners
dry
and
hoppy
so
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
could
use
a
little
balance
from
the
malt
light
body
with
abundant
carbonation
could
tone
down
the
carbonation
a
little
extremely
drinkable
with
one
likes
saaz
hops
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
these
by
the
5
liter
mugs
on
a
hot
day
i
feel
like
the
alcohol
percentage
was
higher
i
dont
normally
get
loopy
after
a
half
pint
of
5
beer
and
i
ate
at
the
same
time
maybe
dehydrated
pint
at
three
good
things
in
el
segundo
tonight
for
four
dollars
was
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
and
this
was
about
as
interesting
as
their
selection
got
color
is
a
light
golden
yellow
creamy
one
inch
white
head
not
much
retention
no
lacing
aroma
is
very
weak
and
has
some
skunkiness
yeast
light
grain
grass
and
maybe
some
citrus
taste
starts
off
light
with
some
grain
watered
down
in
the
middle
finish
is
yeasty
and
grainy
pretty
crisp
at
first
but
not
once
it
warms
chewier
by
the
end
but
this
is
meant
to
be
a
refreshing
pilsner
and
it
does
not
really
achieve
that
slightly
chewy
and
watery
mouthfeel
thin
bodied
way
too
much
carbonation
taste
does
not
last
goes
down
easy
and
does
even
seem
five
percent
light
and
not
much
to
it
drinkability
is
good
but
flavor
suffers
as
a
result
little
better
than
the
standard
budweiser
and
also
different
in
many
ways
although
i
do
see
many
similarities
as
well
would
not
drink
again
not
recommended
d
this
beer
feels
light
crisp
and
refreshing
definitely
sessionable
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
short
lived
white
head
it
is
golden
yellow
and
clear
i
immediately
got
a
skunk
beer
smell
even
worse
than
heineken
i
do
get
a
sweet
smell
after
i
get
over
the
awful
skunk
smell
the
taste
is
worse
than
the
smell
i
taste
metal
and
i
think
there
is
actually
a
hint
of
skunk
ass
i
have
never
tried
skunk
ass
but
this
has
to
be
a
close
equivalent
i
was
offered
two
of
these
and
i
am
definately
glad
i
only
took
one
im
sure
its
better
in
the
czech
republic
so
they
may
as
well
keep
it
there
i
ordered
a
bottle
in
a
us
bar
amsterdam
ale
house
and
although
it
wasnt
as
good
as
the
belgian
original
it
was
actually
very
good
this
seems
like
a
beer
that
is
a
victim
of
extended
shelf
aging
in
a
green
bottle
blech
you
guys
are
all
posers
dont
you
know
there
is
a
budvar
10
and
a
budvar
12
and
furthermore
the
budvar
that
earned
the
reputation
is
the
10
the
10
and
12
are
like
night
and
day
go
to
the
czech
republic
and
have
a
budvar
10
on
draft
all
we
get
in
the
states
is
the
budvar
12
which
is
nothing
more
than
a
glorified
becks
and
all
these
geeks
love
to
talk
about
the
budvars
superiority
over
ab
when
they
have
never
even
had
the
budvar
that
is
the
cause
of
the
whole
brewhaha
ha
ha
indeed
get
out
of
your
moms
basement
and
travel
a
very
clean
flavor
from
a
simple
pils
is
really
all
i
ask
this
one
has
a
wheat
and
corn
in
the
malt
flavor
with
gentle
fruits
for
more
depth
this
one
is
a
nice
withdinner
beer
the
feel
is
crispy
and
fresh
until
the
end
and
since
its
from
a
green
imported
bottle
thats
a
really
good
thing
been
wondering
about
this
for
a
while
pale
golden
color
high
amounts
of
carbonation
noble
hops
aroma
slightly
flowery
and
flavor
are
definitely
noticeable
but
not
dominate
pale
malt
flavors
provides
a
little
sweetness
drinks
easy
but
not
too
memorable
cannot
complain
about
this
beer
wish
a
30
pack
was
as
cheap
as
american
budwesier
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
rich
goldbrown
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
a
slightly
hopy
aroma
this
beer
has
a
rich
pilsener
flavor
with
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
feels
good
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
fairly
well
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
czechvars
okay
its
not
good
by
any
means
but
ive
had
worse
it
doesnt
vary
from
the
bells
and
whistles
youd
normally
find
in
the
style
its
far
from
a
looker
and
the
nose
is
underpowered
and
very
average
those
aspects
need
some
work
otherwise
its
above
average
but
doesnt
dazzle
in
any
respect
its
probably
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
recommend
it
its
far
from
a
memorable
experience
4
still
good
for
a
lunchtime
brew
accompanied
by
a
sandwich
i
expected
more
from
this
one
though
very
solid
without
being
special
pours
a
beautiful
golden
summer
color
with
a
minimal
head
a
great
ring
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
floral
hops
some
citrus
and
sweet
malt
ahh
the
original
budweiser
what
a
great
lager
and
summertime
brew
i
like
this
lager
it
drinkslooks
like
a
wheat
but
drinks
like
the
true
pilsner
it
is
the
taste
is
floral
noble
hops
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
finish
its
a
surprisingly
well
balanced
lager
and
its
a
great
summer
brew
easy
to
drink
flavorful
i
keep
it
in
the
fridge
all
summer
long
great
to
have
between
stouts
and
ipas
this
is
a
classic
lager
highly
recommended
for
summer
its
really
good
and
i
am
not
a
lager
fan
at
all
pour
is
pure
golden
in
color
with
a
white
head
looks
like
a
classic
nose
is
minty
earth
straw
and
honey
a
palate
of
bitter
and
an
aftertaste
mild
of
pollen
and
consistent
proteinhair
not
very
extreme
in
flavor
not
a
lot
of
character
wouldnt
have
as
my
pilsner
of
choice
d
would
be
easy
to
quaff
several
of
these
in
a
session
a
good
every
day
beer
to
drink
if
a
pilsener
is
what
you
looking
for
crisp
and
clean
overall
despite
its
unremarkable
appearance
this
is
a
very
good
lager
with
a
surprising
amount
of
complexity
and
very
good
balance
of
flavors
overall
its
a
really
nicely
balanced
readily
accessible
beer
each
of
its
characteristics
are
finetuned
and
distinct
unlike
some
other
beers
where
the
components
can
become
muddled
very
drinkable
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
recognize
this
over
to
the
other
budweiser
its
fairly
drinkable
but
nothing
too
special
the
smell
and
taste
are
very
clean
and
crisp
as
a
good
pils
should
be
there
are
some
light
grassy
notes
some
mild
hop
bittering
definitely
more
evident
in
the
smell
than
in
the
taste
other
than
that
it
is
a
pretty
mild
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
good
definitely
a
solid
replacement
for
a
macro
lager
very
good
drinking
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
if
only
they
could
have
grabbed
the
name
before
abs
grubby
hands
got
ahold
of
it
who
knows
what
would
have
happened
decent
mouthfeel
kind
of
watery
but
this
is
a
very
refreshing
lager
like
many
others
but
still
way
better
than
any
macro
very
drinkable
takes
me
right
back
to
prague
every
time
a
sweet
refreshing
crisp
czech
lager
dont
know
if
id
go
outta
my
way
to
pick
this
guy
up
but
always
a
great
memory
while
the
aroma
is
pleasant
the
flavor
is
much
less
appreciated
back
home
in
the
land
of
ales
and
spectacular
beers
deliciously
drinkable
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
fairly
average
clear
amber

it
does
have
a
nice

rather
weak
malty
and
not
promising
flavor
is
wan
but
palatable
malty
with
a
good

is
smooth
and
fairly
tingly
i
am

not

with

refreshing
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
not
quite
a
good
one
almost
good
a
little
above
average
i
think
but
only
by
a
hair
this
is
oh
so
very
drinkable
the
combination
of
sadly
fading
memories
and
the
present
veritable
reality
ramming
the
point
home
as
this
halflitre
bottle
disappeared
quite
readily
protest
the
stupification
of
the
beer
world
in
terms
of
quality
and
marketing
and
partake
of
this
anytime
you
can
i
surely
will
pretty
much
everything
great
about
a
czech
beer
high
drinkable
very
refreshing
and
very
crisp
finishes
slightly
hoppybitter
but
not
so
much
that
you
dont
want
to
have
another
you
can
smell
and
taste
the
hops
but
they
are
balanced
nicely
by
the
maltiness
of
this
beer
i
prefer
it
to
urquel
but
you
cant
go
wrong
with
either
nice
change
of
pace
beer
for
a
back
year
barbecue
i
honestly
dont
get
the
hype
as
in
my
opinion
this
is
honestly
mediocre
at
best
and
quite
possibly
crap
it
tastes
more
like
adjuncts
than
anything
from
bmc
czech
pils
are
highly
underrated
i
like
urquell
a
bit
better
but
this
is
a
damn
solid
and
tasty
beer
that
i
would
take
over
many
drinkability
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
one
of
the
best
representatives
of
the
czech
pilsner
style
czechs
have
great
pride
and
heritage
in
their
beer
beer
in
the
czech
republic
is
a
matter
of
culture
national
identity
and
history
and
as
result
of
the
high
quality
of
its
pilsners
the
entire
world
has
followed
suit
in
embedding
yellow
filtered
lagers
as
mainstream
national
drinks
of
their
own
anheuserbusch
may
claim
their
budweiser
is
the
king
of
beers
but
budejovicky
budvar
was
at
one
point
the
beer
of
kings
literally
speaking
d
tastier
that
bmc
overall
a
good
flavorful
lawnmower
beer
i
mean
it
is
what
it
is
but
it
is
better
than
your
average
american
macro
or
green
bottle
import
no
pilsner
urquell
but
still
a
good
summer
slammer
overall
a
very
well
made
pilsner
certainly
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
hearty
meat
dish
or
just
with
friends
not
nearly
as
crisp
as
i
would
hope
and
although
its
not
bad
by
any
stretch
there
are
just
so
many
superior
options
that
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
this
beer
has
a
velvety
soft
and
smooth
mouthfeel
and
is
eminently
drinkable
with
a
refined
taste
you
expect
from
a
good
lager
very
enjoyable
crisp
and
light
on
the
fizz
very
easy
to
drink
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
czechvar
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
medium
white
head
it
has
abit
of
a
grassy
spicy
aroma
nothing
to
get
excited
about
the
taste
has
a
pleasant
spicy
bitterness
to
it
the
finish
is
crisp
clean
and
dry
czechvar
is
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
a
very
sessionable
pilsner
overall
this
is
a
fine
fine
beer
from
the
czech
republic
if
one
goes
into
this
tasting
know
that
one
will
get
the
butter
of
a
strong
diacetyl
content
its
perfectly
fine
if
not
their
surprise
i
guess
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
worthy
of
the
budweiser
name
whether
the
courts
say
so
or
not
i
enjoyed
it
and
provided
you
know
about
diacetyl
i
expect
you
will
too
good
stuff
and
highly
recommended
crisp
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
i
like
overall
very
nice
and
i
bet
it
would
be
even
better
if
it
were
a
whole
lot
fresher
d
very
drinkable
a
good
summer
afternoon
lazing
in
the
backyard
kind
of
beer
recommended
mouthfeel
is
very
tight
and
carbonation
is
near
spot
on
very
drinkable
and
perfect
for
summer
d
goes
down
smooth
a
light
beer
would
be
a
good
summer
drink
ive
had
similar
beers
that
didnt
cost
as
much
not
bad
just
another
attempt
by
bw
to
make
another
dollar
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
had
virtually
no
head
it
left
no
lacing
to
mention
either
it
smells
slightly
skunky
with
a
touch
of
hops
but
nothing
overpowering
this
beer
does
not
have
much
flavor
it
is
bitter
with
a
slightly
grassy
finish
there
is
not
much
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
slightly
carbonated
overall
this
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
it
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
sample
and
could
even
see
myself
drinking
this
again
mouth
can
feel
the
typical
bitterness
of
this
styleand
this
starting
from
the
first
sip
the
carbonation
is
idealone
of
the
best
results
in
my
opinion
this
premium
czech
lager
which
is
actually
a
pilsner
relabeled
for
the
us
market
was
a
straw
gold
color
out
of
a
bottle
the
head
was
white
shortlived
and
left
scattered
lacing
down
my
glass
the
aroma
was
very
grainy
dry
and
classical
as
one
would
expect
from
a
europilsner
the
flavors
started
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
that
was
then
followed
by
a
huge
nothingbutdry
graininess
but
there
was
nothing
to
it
more
than
that
admittedly
i
thought
it
tasted
exactly
as
a
czech
pilsner
should
and
the
acidity
was
right
on
but
there
was
no
depth
the
finish
however
was
quite
crisp
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
carbonation
medium
and
the
body
medium
too
a
nice
refreshing
pilsener
this
beer
hits
all
the
right
notes
even
if
it
never
quite
astounds
the
palate
recommended
d
drinkable
as
cold
water
this
another
one
im
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
it
anyway
pours
out
that
beautiful
deep
golden
yellow
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
looks
real
nice
smell
is
very
fresh
for
a
green
bottle
you
can
really
smell
the
hops
in
this
one
that
pretty
much
dominates
the
smell
which
i
really
like
taste
is
top
notch
i
would
of
given
this
a
5
but
its
not
it
has
one
minor
flaw
it
goes
down
smooth
with
perfect
carbonation
finishes
very
dry
and
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
is
just
very
satisfying
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
tad
watery
on
the
finish
its
like
hops
water
hoppy
aftertaste
its
a
very
minor
thing
but
its
there
so
it
gets
docked
5
because
its
not
perfect
mouthfeel
is
also
top
notch
nice
and
light
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
great
drinker
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
it
pairs
nicely
with
spicy
food
and
a
nice
steak
if
your
a
fan
of
uruquell
you
will
defiantly
enjoy
this
one
this
is
the
second
best
czech
pils
in
my
mind
cheers
drink
is
pretty
good
lager
id
drink
it
if
i
lived
in
czech
each
sip
asks
for
another
of
this
tasty
beverage
this
one
is
much
better
than
the
american
lager
of
the
same
name
its
a
nice
onceinawhile
brew
im
always
looking
for
a
good
pilsner
to
offset
the
zeitgeist
of
big
brews
and
im
adding
this
one
to
the
list
not
too
heavy
of
an
alcohol
taste
good
flavor
and
good
balance
not
too
much
of
an
atmosphere
however
but
does
have
a
great
color
to
its
credit
i
am
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
personally
but
this
is
a
really
good
representative
for
this
style
overall
very
good
quaff
mouthfeel
is
thin
highly
carbonated
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
hot
weather
beer
and
would
be
preferred
over
bmc
there
is
no
reason
i
wouldnt
try
this
again
but
id
prefer
another
serving
type
if
possible
particularly
on
tap
the
original
bud
is
much
better
than
the
great
american
lager
crisp
and
hearty
with
a
nice
little
hoppy
kick
on
the
finish
this
beer
will
see
more
time
in
my
fridge
d
its
a
really
good
drinker
i
could
put
more
than
a
couple
back
in
a
single
sitting
overall
this
is
a
tasty
if
not
slightly
bitter
i
noted
that
it
worked
well
with
a
duck
lunch
later
in
my
trip
to
prague
overall
as
sampled
a
mediocre
euro
lager
and
nothing
more
hardly
up
to
the
b
average
of
ba
perhaps
my
sample
was
light
struck
it
was
well
within
the
freshness
date
as
sampled
hopefully
with
less
skunkiness

in

it
was
a

it

i

this

just
found
that
a

of

brews
were
better
when
compared
to
this


this
isnt

it
is
so
difficult
to

a
good
12
oz
green
bottle
pours
a
typical
golden
pils
color
with
a
white
head
leaving
minimal
lacing
behind
lighter
grassy
botanical
hoppy
notes
and
faintly
malty
smells
clean
and
unobtrusive
taste
is
rather
neutral
theres
enough
maltiness
and
hoppiness
to
counterbalance
each
other
resulting
in
a
brew
thats
enjoyable
to
drink
without
taxation
of
the
senses
i
do
recall
liking
this
beer
more
out
of
the
half
liter
brown
bottles
though
its
shining
point
is
its
crispness
palatability
and
ease
in
enjoyment
a
good
lager
from
the
czech
republic
that
is
worth
trying
although
pilseners
arent
my
favorite
style
i
really
like
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
on
a
warm
day
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
golden
yellow
in
colour
and
as
clear
as
it
needs
to
be
crisp
maltiness
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hoppiness
makes
this
a
great
pilsener
to
drink
just
about
any
time
i
see
myself
buying
a
lot
of
this
in
the
near
future
budweiser
is
actually
trying
to
say
people
might
confuse
this
with
their
beer
i
highly
doubt
it
imho
a
good
representation
of
the
style
somewhat
onedimensional
refreshing
cold
but
lost
its
appeal
as
it
warmed
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
czechvar
and
it
is
certainly
better
than
many
mainstream
american
lagers
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
lager
czechvar
is
a
good
choice
so
czechvar
is
the
real
budweiser
huh
its
pretty
decent
beer
all
things
considered
its
clean
refreshing
and
quaffable
in
other
words
everything
the
american
budweiser
isnt
id
have
to
classify
this
one
as
a
pleasant
surprise
ng
had
this
on
tap
at
chauncey
smith
in
draft
in
fall
of
2009
it
was
better
in
smell
taste
mouthfeel
and
that
is
the
basis
of
my
rating
not
too
shabby
personally
i
never
really
find
too
much
to
say
about
pilsners
but
this
one
actually
has
some
character
to
it
nice
malty
taste
and
golden
color
the
head
quickly
disappeared
but
on
a
hot
day
it
really
didnt
matter
as
far
as
czech
pilsners
go
i
really
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
it
pours
a
pale
straw
color
and
is
crystal
clear
with
a
big
fluffy
head
i
am
drinking
a
budwesier
yet
there
is
no
corn
in
the
aroma
instead
it
has
a
gentle
graininess
and
some
delicate
flowery
hops
the
light
body
has
some
sweet
grain
i
cant
believe
the
fresh
hoppiness
of
bud
wait
wrong
bud
this
is
a
great
change
of
pace
to
the
american
macro
it
has
a
nice
bitter
finish
and
is
quite
refreshing
definitely
great
when
had
fresh
as
opposed
to
an
imported
bottle
nice
classic
pilsner
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
mostly
disappeared
rather
quickly
but
left
bits
of
lace
on
the
glass
strong
aroma
of
noble
hops
quite
crisp
medium
bodied
with
fairly
high
carbonation
hop
bitterness
shines
through
from
beginning
to

with
some
spiciness
at
the
finish
smooth
and

with

settles

dry
with

lightish
mouthfeel
with
a

barely

impression

to
bitter
pepperlike
hops
which
are
this
beers
best
feature
rounds
out
with
a
reduced
sense
of
whats
happening
mid
mouth
overall
a
decently
delicate
close
pretty
good
beer
nice
balance
and
a
drinkable
quality
the
malts
seemed
slightly
on
the
stale
side
throughout
the
glass
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
beer
its
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
though
its
quite
pricey
for
what
it
is
in
my
opinion
but
a
good
beer
either
way
clean
and
crisp
very
refreshing
glad
i
bought
a
few
of
these
tastes
more
like
a
good
pils
than
a
lager
but
whats
the
difference
anyway
a
nice
summer
brew
to
quench
your
thirst
with
a
flavorful
and
well
balanced
european
classic
pours

golden
lets
out

lightly

crisp
in

with

zest
ive
been
waiting
to
try
the
real
bud
for
awhile
no
let
downs
as
this
is
a
real
lager
it
goes
great
with
anything
and
its
a
solid
brew
for
sure
i
was
excited
to
see
this
at
the
little
kiosk
seeing
the
bottle
i
knew
i
had
to
try
the
original
bud
pours
a
crisp

enough
to
enjoy

a

beer

has

pieces
to
be
analyzed
occasionally

appearance

aroma
is

backbone
taste
is
initially
tangy

green
with
a
building
sweetness
that
almost
goes
too
far
before
mellowing
out
into
a
fruity
twist
at
the
finish
little
to
no
bite
from
the
hops
but
plenty
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is

spoton
for

said
it
might
be
a
tad
overhyped
indeed
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
thick
and
creamy
taste
is
strong
on
caramel
with
fresh
apple
aftertaste
on
the
palate
like
a
buttery
cideror
a
caramelcovered
apple
little
hops
to
speak
of
clean
finish
damn
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
if
pilsner
is
your
thing
this
is
where
its
at
my
lawnmower
beer
of
choice
not
as
good
as
reputation
holds
but
still
a
servicable
brew
doesnt
warm
particularly
well
malty
version
of
style
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
three
fingers
of
head
there
is
lots
of
chunky
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
grassy
with
a
little
bit
of
malts
and
hops
present
the
taste
is
a
little
malty
at
first
with
some
sweetness
to
it
a
grassy
hop
bite
rounds
out
the
finish
creating
beautiful
balance
the
taste
is
fairly
thick
for
a
pilsener
and
sooo
crisp
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
fantasic
better
than
almost
any
other
beer
even
for
the
style
this
is
the
lager
upon
which
all
other
lagers
should
be
judged
i
wish
all
lagers
were
this
good
drinkability
this
is
a
great
session
beer
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
grow
tired
of
this
one
if
you
walk
from
the
muzeum
metro
stop
down
václavské
street
in
prague
youll
notice
two
huge
brewery
logos
on
one
of
the
buildings
on
the
right
pilsner
urquell
and
budweiser
the
two
titans
of
czech
brewing
busweiser
is
probably
more
famous
among
the
beer
community
for
its
fight
with
ab
in
the
u
s
which
is
fairly
ridiculous
while
the
brewery
deserves
support
its
a
shame
that
this
beer
is
so
average
even
straight
from
the
source
a
mediocre
to
average
pilsner
not
really
worth
tracking
down
if
youre
in
the
czech
republic
try
pilsner
urquell
on
tap
instead
a
very
pale
yellow
golden
color
the
head
is
foamy
and
fades
into
a
very
thin
collar
or
more
exactly
it
disappears
the
smell
is
grainy
malty
almost
roasted
the
taste
was
very
enjoyable
grainy
and
malty
with
a
thin
caramel
aspect
slightly
iodated
with
citrus
and
floral
hops
malts
and
hops
are
harmoniously
combined
the
mouthfeel
is
very
round
with
a
long
lasting
hoppy
finish
in
comparison
with
pilsner
urquell
i
find
budvar
much
better
and
much
more
drinkable
not
a
holy
grail
while
it
towers
over
generic
euro
lagers
its
rather
unappealing
with
its
admission
price
but
money
i
spend
with
pleasure
knowing
im
giving
money
to
the
david
to
american
budweisers
goliath
people
always
say
this
beer
is
exactly
like
pilsner
urquell
having
had
both
i
gotta
question
that
statement
they
are
similar
in
that
they
are
both
pilsners
both
from
the
czech
republic
thats
where
they
end
i
prefer
pu
over
this
but
will
drink
this
with
a
2nd
thought
clean
and
spicy
slightly
thin
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
smells
good
looks
great
and
tastes
pretty
good
i
recommend
it
smells
of
light
hops
and
tastes
malty
and
hoppy
if
those
are
even
really
words
very
gentle
mouthfeel
and
so
easy
to
drink
it
almost
drinks
itself
what
a
lager
should
taste
like
the
taste
is
beautifully
balanced
with
just
the
right
finish
which
makes
me
want
another
bottle
ive
had
drier
lagers
and
breadier
tasting
lagers
but
this
must
be
considered
an
archetype
for
all
pilsners
along
with
urquell
damn
you
bud
czechzar
is
true
pours
a
clear
golden
color
of
a
new
brass
instrument
with
a
modest
white
sudsy
type
head
that
thins
down
to
a
layer
and
then
finally
to
a
white
halo
around
where
the
beer
kisses
the
air
and
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
a
subtle
yet
rich
smooth
malt
and
mild
saaz
hops
the
first
taste
repeats
the
aroma
with
a
more
pronounced
hop
and
carb
bite
and
tapers
off
into
the
pillowy
malt
zone
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
for
this
style
and
finishes
slightly
dry
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
these
beers
are
way
underated
imo
as
i
see
them
as
being
no
less
complex
than
big
beers
they
are
just
sleepers
that
arent
given
their
deserved
credit
heres
to
you
this
buds
for
you
the
real
budweiser
this
is
a
world
class
bohemian
lager
excellent
malt
great
bitterness
saaz
on
the
nose
clear
medium
yellow
mild
lageresque
aroma
of
lemons
and
spices
thin
in
the
mouth
very
mild
with
good
carbonation
with
some
nice
subtle
grain
and
citrus
flavors
very
much
like
pilsner
urquell
but
nowhere
as
easily
available
this
is
the
best
slightly
marred
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
yes
that
is
quite
a
caveat
if
it
wasnt
for
the
skunkiness
this
would
be
a
very
fine
beer
i
got
a
case
of
this
stuff
from
a
wine
shop
that
was
getting
rid
of
their
beer
for
14
99
at
that
price
i
nearly
bathed
in
the
stuff
very
easy
to
drink
pretty
tasty
beer
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
question
czechvar
only
promotes
this
beer
as
a
bohemian
lager
not
as
a
pilsener
is
a
bohemian
lager
automatically
considered
a
pilsener
even
if
its
not
labeled
or
promoted
as
such
by
the
brewer
comments
i
have
also
had
this
in
germany
while
stationed
there
a
few
years
ago
while
in
the
military
and
was
very
happy
to
see
it
finally
come
stateside
albeit
with
a
new
name
same
great
taste
same
easy
to
drink
beer
that
i
remember
one
not
to
be
missed
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
it
czechvar
was
a
pleasant
well
balanced
pils
that
was
good
at
midafternoon
after
a
few
hours
of
yardwork
not
a
remarkable
beer
but
definitely
not
the
worst
pils
ive
had
roll
across
my
tongue
poured
very
gold
and
very
clear
with
a
puffy
whiteoff
white
head
the
smell
was
slightly
maltygrainy
with
citrushop
notes
the
taste
was
indicative
of
the
smell
slightly
sweet
malt
but
well
balanced
with
the
citrushops
also
some
grain
and
alcohol
flavors
lingering
in
the
background
i
didnt
detect
the
herb
flavors
that
some
have
remarked
about
but
i
only
drank
2
so
perhaps
if
i
get
the
chance
again
ill
be
able
to
scrutinize
it
a
bit
more
mouthfeel
was
excellent
crisp
and
dry
drinkability
was
good
also
in
my
opinion
helped
along
by
the
crispness
worth
trying
and
maybe
even
worth
the
hype
i
wonder
just
how
good
this
is
sampled
at
the
source
there
has
to
be
some
quality
loss
from
traveling
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
where
i
sampled
it
but
its
lucky
and
malt
flavourful
variation
of
the
crap
you
generally
draw
from
getyourarsedrunkcheap
lagers
was
a
satisfying
experience
which
invited
for
another
few
bottles
to
be
ordered
sweet
but
bitter
well
carbonbalanced
its
worth
a
try
among
the
ever
worse
family
of
lagers
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
id
keep
it
on
hand
if
i
could
find
it
around
here
czechvar
certainly
is
the
darling
of
the
beer
geek
for
standing
up
to
the
evil
empire

that
leaves
a

fresh

nice
clean
light
bready

spicy

light
bodied
with
a
crisp

finishes
dry
and
crisp
with
plenty
of
carbonation
a
decent
example
of
the
style
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
and
a
transparent
light
orange
colored
body
with
carbonation
rising
up
the
sides
on
the
mug
it
has
a
mild
hop
aroma
with
the
flavor
of
a
lager
and
its
head
left
little
lacing
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
not
bad
and
not
great
i
could
taste
notes
of
chewy
hops
and
some
acidic
bitterness
in
its
finish
wow
a
clean
lager
the
nose
is
crisp
and
a
little
malty
so
is
the
taste
a
clean
summer
brew
if
i
ever
saw
one
it
is
almost
like
ive
stumbled
into
an
alternate
universe
where
things
are
so
strange
that
bud
is
appealing
when
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
had
a
quick
dissolving
head
and
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
carbonation
could
be
seen
rising
to
the
top
with
this
beer
the
hue
was
gold
it
had
a
fruity
sweet
aroma
there
was
an
aftertaste
with
this
beer
the
body
has
a
refreshing
carbonation
and
is
rich
without
detracting
from
the
refreshing
nature
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
pale
gold
or
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
amount
of
creamy
white
head
got
a
skunked
bottled
but
was
still
able
to
get
a
sicy
hop
aroma
out
of
it
nice
substantial
mouthfeel
though
still
on
the
light
side
quite
malty
with
a
nice
sweetness
coming
through
the
spicy
hops
quite
nice
and
probably
easily
a
4
if
you
get
a
good
bottle
this
may
be
a
good
conversion
beer
for
the
macro
beer
drinkers
out
there
it
has
a
better
more
crisp
flavor
than
american
bud
and
does
not
leave
any
chemical
tastes
behind
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
white
frothy
head
the
smell
is
lightly
malty
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
very
rich
in
malt
but
without
hops
to
balance
it
out
i
was
expecting
more
but
was
disappointed
still
not
a
bad
brew
very
tasty
and
light
on
the
palate
this
is
a
nice
czech
lagerpils
not
the
best
i
far
prefered
starobrno
and
even
radegast
i
wish
i
bought
a
500ml
bottle
instead
of
the
12
oz
bottle
overall
a
very
pleasant
easy
drinking
beer
not
challenging
but
fairly
tasty
this
would
be
an
excellent
summer
beer
the
best
before
date
stamped
on
the
back
label
gave
lots
of
time
to
work
with
pours
out
a
vibrant
gold
hue
with
a
moderate
head
of
foam
nose
seems
a
little
complex
small
amount
of
sweet
malt
definite
presence
of
hops
and
an
undeniable
appearance
of
cirtus
and
herbs
flavour
is
similarly
complex
everything
in
small
increments
dancing
around
except
for
the
bitter
hop
finish
which
is
very
apparent
malt
is
sweet
and
there
are
lemon
and
coppery
layers
in
there
as
well
drinkability
would
have
been
rated
higher
but
the
hops
seemed
to
overpower
all
the
other
surprising
little
naunces
before
i
could
pick
them
out
and
enjoy
them
otherwise
a
mighty
fine
beer
for
a
good
session
drinkability
while
i
doubt
that
few
beers
can
live
up
to
the
hype
that
this
one
gets
this
is
a
good
standard
lager
its
not
something
i
could
buy
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
meets
the
lawnmower
beer
criteria
perfectly
notes
a
distinguished
lager
clean
refreshing
and
crisp
it
also
has
something
that
its
north
american
bottomfermented
cousins
seem
to
be
lacking
flavour
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
beer
goes
great
with
all
but
the
most
spicey
foods
this
is
a
great
pilsner
to
use
a
yardstick
to
measure
all
others
i
dont
think
that
many
surpass
it
golden
in
color
with
a
loose
and
airy
head
the
taste
pervaded
my
nose
like
few
others
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilsners
but
this
one
fits
the
role
pretty
well
nice
pilsner
beer
frothy
head
that
stays
nice
spicy
saaz
hop
aroma
is
evident
fizzy
yellow
with
lighter
body
than
pilsner
urquell
and
no
butterinesswhich
can
no
longer
be
found
in
pu
either
this
brew
is
drier
and
less
malty
than
pu
dry
finish
with
a
spicy
hop
flavor
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
a
very
clean
slick
lagery
beer
pretty
good
stuff
this
is
a
great
pilsener
beer
no
skunkiness
at
all
in
my
6pack
despite
the
green
bottles
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
especially
on
a
hot
day
great
saaz
hops
taste
gives
it
nice
flavor
not
malty
but
exotic
hops
taste
is
really
really
good
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
i
highly
recommend
this
for
anyone
who
wants
to
try
an
authentic
czech
pilsener
even
macroswill
drinkers
will
like
it
notes
this
is
clearly
a
different
beer
compared
to
our
czechvar
if
not
ingredients
than
something
in
the
packaging
id
say
it
is
better
but
not
by
much
a
very
clean
and
spicy
pils
appearance
pours
a
clear
and
bright
golden
color
decent
carbonation
the
head
is
white
colored
and
leaves
a
thin
lace
around
the
glass
on
the
nose
there
is
a
herbal
aroma
noble
hops
and
a
grassy
aroma
medium
body
and
a
smooth
and
slightly
tingly
mouthfeel
on
the
palate
the
flavors

of
hops

bitterness
crisp
dryness
peppery
grainy
and

emm
a
most
excellent
pilsner
interesting
and
full
flavored
overall
a
tasty
brew
this
poured
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
settled
posthaste
wonderful
brilliant
gold
in
the
pilsner
glass
a
light
touch
of
skunkiness
noted
when
first
poured
gives
way
to
a
mild
malt
sweetness
and
a
subtle
grassy
character
taste
is
a
soft
maltiness
that
morphs
into
a
very
pleasing
laid
back
hop
bitterness
gentle
carbonation
pleases
the
palate
quite
nicely
finishes
up
mild
and
delicate
malt
and
hop
coming
together
in

this
is
fantastic
on

now
if

only

here
one
of
my
new
favorite
pilsners

up

followed
by
some
light

subtle
fairly
smooth

decent
drinkable
brew
when
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
this
type
of
beer
really
does
not
do
much
for
me
anymore
and
i
always
end
up
wishing
i
had
an
ale
golden
colored
pils
with
normal
head
for
this
type
of
beer
it
doesnt
smell
particulary
much
and
the
taste
is
very
neutral
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
that
it
doesnt
taste
much
i
think
thats
the
best
with
this
beer
it
tastes
really
good
and
clean
this
is
an
easy
drinkable
beer
for
everyone
pours

clear
golden
color
with
a

fades
right
away
to

still
very
refreshing

the
style
leaves
a
very
slight
aftertaste

overall
pretty
drinkable
taste
sweet
hoppy
but
not
too
hoppy
more
delicate
if
poured

for

ive
really
enjoyed
my
first
taste
of
this

this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
seems
very
much
the
epitomy
of
the
style
and
rightly
deserves
to
be
the
standard
that
other
pilsners
are
measured
against
if
i
was
in
the
czech
republic
id
drink
this
all
the
time
but
since
im
in
the
usa
ill
buy
one
of
many
equally
good
locally
produced
pilsners
pours
a
gold
colour
topped
by
a
poor
head
average
carbonation
and
no
lace
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
this
beer
regular
pilsener
aroma
and
taste
abv
is
5
0
and
goes
down
quite
easily
especially
with
food
probably
the
only
advantage
it
was
the
first
czech
lager
i
had
and
i
got
the
wrong
impression
for
czech
beers
as
a
brewer
with
a
particular
appreciation
for
decoction
brewed
czech
malt
and
zaatec
saaz
hops
this
is
the
perfect
pilsner
more
delicate
than
urquell
and
smoother
than
a
good
day
there
is
no
end
to
the
easy
pleasure
that
this
brew
brings
in
my
estimation
nobody
would
dislike
this
beer
it
is
as
complicated
as
youll
let
it
be
simplicity
is
often
the
hardest
achievable
goal
to
admire
a
smooth
pour
followed
by
a
very
delicate
hop
aroma
the
deep
but
discernible
malt
flavors
surface
while
lightly
masked
by
the
saaz
flavors
a
smooth
mouthfeel
remains
behind
while
reminding
you
to
taste
again
this
shall
be
my
desire
to
one
day
come
close
to
duplicating
cheers
to
budvar
nose
of
cider
mill
donuts
green
beans
and
pond
edges
a
honey
coated
biscuit
mingles
with
steely
hop
through
a
draught
and
eventually
funnels
into
a
tart
tongue
smacking
pile
of
fresh
leaves
a
pleasing
lace
is
left
behind
for
entertainment
as
a
glass
is
steadily
drained
weighty
but
light
like
concrete
with
wings
a
class
pils
enjoyable
anytime
better
than
average
appearance
is
a
midlight
golden
hue
with
a
nice
crown
that
lingered
around
disapating
to
a
nice
thick
lace
and
glass
ring
taste
is
just
ok
plus
mild
malty
finish
with
slight
after
taste
of
the
hops
i
liked
it
i
think
yup
i
did
it
poured
a
nice
medium
golden
color
with
very
little
foam
the
taste
was
nice
and
smooth
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
would
buy
this
beer
over
bud
anytime
this
lager
is
my
second
favorite
beer
that
is
for
a
lager
so
far
apparently
ab
really
has
a
tendency
to
do
this
a
little
thing
i
learnt
on
the
heineken
brewery
tour
in
amsterdam
the
clydesdale
horses
and
wagon
logo
was
first
used
by
heineken
in
the
1700s
about
100
years
before
ab
existed
the
reason
is
the
larger
horses
were
needed
to
actually
pull
the
wagon
and
deliver
the
large
wooden
barrels
of
beer
around
the
city
the
sr
heinekens
widow
actually
drove
the
wagon
that
to
this
day
with
a
team
of
horses
sits
in
the
stables
in
the
1st
floor
of
the
old
amstel
brewery
just
south
of
the
red
light
district
in
amsterdam
crystal
clear
yellow
color
darker
than
most
pils
fizzy
almost
bubbly
creamy
head
then
it
evaporated
thin
covering
stayed
with
the
beer
some
sweet
butterscotch
smells
initially
then
fade
decent
grain
and
malt
smells
very
much
a
standard
pilsener
smells
sour
oder
emerges
more
toward
the
bottom
taste
is
very
evenly
sourthen
light
malt
taste
some
saaz
hop
bite
sour
grainy
old
beer
finish
wet
grass
taste
but
not
medium
carbonation
light
bodied
overall
an
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
beer
among
the
better
pilseners
i
have
had
green
bottle
had
a
gold
foil
label
covering
cap
and
part
of
the
neck
expiration
date
was
072003
didnt
notice
any
ill
effects
to
the
taste
or
aroma
as
a
result
of
being
in
a
green
bottle
either
poured
a
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
which
disappeared
to
practically
nothing
after
a
few
minutes
color
seemed
a
bit
darker
that
most
pilsners
aroma
consisted
primarily
of
a
pleasant
malt
scent
with
saaz
hops
present
also
crisp
smooth
intriguing
mouthfeel
excellent
balance
of
flavor
that
has
a
bready
malt
finish
this
is
a
great
pils
and
definitely
one
i
would
recommend
a
pretty
excellent
czech
lager
beautiful
golden
colour
and
a
nice
head
on
this
puppy
a
great
beer
to
just
drink
it
is
great
on
its
own
and
also
complements
most
foods
quite
well
this
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
aroma
and
it
tastes
just
like
a
lager
should
perhaps
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
that
i
have
ever
encountered
not
as
good
as
the
hype
suggest
but
damn
good
none
the
less
a
quaffer
to
be
certain
in
conclusion
this
is
a
well
balance
beer
that
stays
with
you
from
start
to
finish
the
way
it
should
be
i
like
this
beer
and
at
this
price
a
case
or
two
will
replace
the
domestic
pils
in
my
varanda
fridge
next
cottage
season
unfortunately
this
is
not
how
i
remember
the
beer
in
germany
and
prague
i
am
trying
to
correct
for
atmosphericsentimental
influences
but
over
there
it
was
absolutely
perfect
here
it
is
butterscotch
yellow
and
giving
of
evenly
toasted
and
fresh
sweet
grain
aromas
together
with
rocky
water
and
moss
notes
the
flavors
are
pure
and
develop
into
polished
bran
sour
wood
and
aluminum
perhaps
my
samples
are
compromised
excited
to
see
this
beer
ontap
and
although
it
was
clean
and
refreshing
and
went
well
with
my
brat
and
lukewarm
german
potato
salad
i
was
disappointed
overall
a
beer
that
in
my
opinion
doesnt
live
up
to
the
megahype
created
by
the
beer
community
so
budweiser
made
a
halfway
decent
beer
well
adam
sandler
occasionally
makes
a
halfway
decent
movie
too
that
doesnt
make
it
a
good
movie
just
a
good
adam
sandler
movie
anyway
no
one
could
argue
that
this
is
far
better
than
a
bud
but
so
what
so
are
99
of
the
other
beers
on
the
market
standing
by
itself
this
beer
is
average
slightly
darker
than
a
standard
pils
with
an
offwhite
thin
head
vaguely
bitter
mild
malt
finish
really
nothing
spectacular
pours
a
nice
medium
golden
color
with
a
moderate
snowwhite
head
and
lively
carbonation
lace
leaves
irregular
rings
on
the
glass
walls
the
lovely
appearance
of
this
beer
epitomizes
the
modern
interpretation
of
what
a
beer
should
look
like
aroma
is
well
balanced
between
the
saaz
hops
and
the
underlying
malts
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
maltiness
which
soon
yields
to
the
citrus
and
herbal
flavors
of
the
hops
finish
is
crisp
dry
and
a
touch
bitter
while
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
pilsner
style
this
is
a
remarkably
fine
beer
not
to
be
missed
the
first
thing
to
say
is
that
this
is
a
strikingly
pretty
beer
a
big
soft
head
floats
on
top
of
crystal
clear
golden
liquid
theres
a
pleasant
musty
german
hop
nose
the
first
taste
is
slighty
sweet
and
malty
the
beer
has
a
crisp
sharp
finish
that
was
expected
for
the
style
its
not
very
highly
hopped
and
not
as
bitter
as
i
expected
still
this
is
a
very
good
beer
crystal
clear
golden
hue
w
a
moderate
head
that
leaves
a
loose
lace
grassy
saaz
hop
nose
w
hints
of
sweet
bready
grain
lightly
hopped
for
pilsner
the
beer
is
left
skewed
towards
malt
sweetness
saaz
hop
flavor
makes
its
presence
known
the
overall
flavor
is
grassy
sweet
and
lightly
grainy
finshes
w
a
light
sugary
sweetness
on
the
tongue
that
fades
quickly
czechvar
is
quite
a
decent
and
drinkable
pilsner
but
is
unfortunately
short
on
hop
bitterness
better
than
bud
absolutely
an
outstanding
pilsner
no
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
drinking
several
of
these
however
rich
dark
golden
color
with
smooth
white
head
saaz
hops
aroma
evident
immediately
taste
is
smooth
and
rich
with
maltiness
becoming
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
hops
bitterness
is
much
more
subdued
than
pilsner
urquell
which
makes
czechvar
a
bit
more
mellow
and
easier
to
drink
i
love
this
beer
look
for
the
brown
single
bottles
if
you
are
worried
of
greenbottle
skunk
bb
is
just
a
perfect
beer
medium
amber
in
color
with
rich
long
lasting
head
smells
somewhat
floral
taste
is
biting
with
a
full
citrus
like
bitterness
but
a
strong
semisweet
malt
backbone
saves
the
day
finishes
dry
and
very
satisfying
not
the
type
of
beer
i
would
drink
one
after
another
but
definately
beats
the
american
budweiser
have
you
ever
canned
tomatoes
if
you
have
you
should
be
familiar
with
the
smell
and
flavor
tomatoes
have
when
cooked
this
beer
had
an
overwhelmingly
strong
odor
and
taste
of
spicy
stewed
tomatoes
it
was
too
strong
to
drink
i
know
this
is
not
normal
for
this
beer
from
the
other
reviews
of
it
i
have
read
and
the
style
doesnt
allow
for
many
strong
flavors
but
it
was
only
days
past
the
best
by
date
and
had
been
stored
in
a
refrigerator
it
should
have
still
been
good
there
was
also
some
floating
particles
in
the
beer
which
i
also
assume
is
not
normal
pilsners
typically
being
filtered
i
will
come
back
and
rerate
but
ive
been
told
by
some
fellow
raters
that
i
should
take
this
beer
into
account
for
my
rating
crisp
clean
nose
vey
pale
yellow
crystal
clear
look
not
a
huge
head
on
the
pour
but
a
lasting
little
pale
white
head
and
lace
fine
lively
little
bubbles
fill
the
brew
a
slight
smoke
malt
nose
with
a
slight
sweetness
lively
mouth
with
great
body
for
a
lager
original
taste
has
a
slight
bitterness
followed
by
a
slightly
sweet
finish
which
is
crisp
i
like
this
beer
and
feel
it
is
a
great
and
true
example
of
the
style
tis
the
roots
of
the
lager
tree
yelloworange
color
thick
bubbly
head
grass
and
hay
on
the
nose
i
can
taste
the
hops
a
bit
more
than
malt
crisp
and
refreshing
but
nothing
special
goldenyellow
body
big
white
rocky
head
small
little
bubbles
rising
from
bottom
to
surface
looks
photogenic
lot
of
hay
little
bit
of
hop
in
nose
good
balance
of
malt
then
hops
in
taste
a
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
those
who
wont
try
micros
they
ask
for
a
bud
give
them
a
bud
love
the
slogan
it
is
what
you
think
it
is
ive
been
watching
and
waiting
for
my
local
liquor
warehouse
to
start
carrying
this
brew
and
they
finally
got
6
cases
on
may
10
they
were
already
down
to
2
cases
when
i
got
there
after
work
i
obviously
got
a
very
fresh
sample
first
observation
this
aint
a
pilsener
its
a
budweiser
i
e
its
from
budweis
not
pilsen
budweisers
are
maltier
than
pilseners
anyway
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
pure
light
golden
color
nice
carbonation
mediumsized
white
head
with
decent
retention
for
a
lager
very
very
balanced
in
the
nose
and
the
palate
definitely
more
malty
than
a
pilsener
but
hops
are
still
evident
one
criticism
i
wish
they
could
have
stuck
with
budweiser
budvars
brown
glass
bottle
instead
of
going
to
green
a
la
pilsener
urquell
i
know
i
got
a
fresh
batch
this
time
but
what
about
the
future
in
sum
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
a
very
popular
beer
on
the
worldwide
scene
i
could
drink
an
awful
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
czechvar
from
the
czech
republic
i
bought
it
in
a
you
guessed
it
half
liter
brown
bottle
with
a
small
gold
foil
cap
the
bottle
says
5
a
b
v
this
is
the
budweiser
budvar
sold
throughout
the
world
but
not
here
had
an
offwhite
thick
head
that
quickly
dissipated
thick
sticky
belgian
lace
absolutely
clear
with
a
light
amber
color
weak
inoffensive
aroma
very
nice
hop
dryness
with
light
malt
aftertaste
comparing
this
to
ab
bud
is
a
crying
shame
i
assume
that
this
is
how
american
lagers
tasted
before
prohibition
and
before
the
macros
found
adjuncts
good
solid
beer
well
i
guess
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
this
beer
is
vastly
overrated
a
dry
metallic
aftertaste
medium
hops
and
carbonation
maybe
it
was
the
green
bottle
i
got
it
for
my
collection
and
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
of
course
this
is
infinitely
better
than
anheuserbuschs
budweiser
that
goes
without
saying
but
is
this
superior
to
pilsner
urquell
a
bit
more
difficult
to
say
fortunately
we
dont
have
to
choose
to
my
mouth
this
is
a
little
better
a
bit
sweeter
maltier
and
fuller
i
might
prefer
pu
on
a
hot
day
since
it
has
more
of
a
zest
however
remember
that
czechvar
the
us
name
of
budweiser
budvar
is
an
extremely
popular
international
massproduced
brews
as
is
pu
while
it
is
one
of
the
premier
brews
in
the
style
the
satisfaction
it
provide
is
very
basic
most
beer
drinkers
should
love
it
beer
connoisseurs
may
be
looking
for
something
more
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
when
i
tasted
this
i
think
my
expectations
were
too
high
very
drinkable
and
great
color
but
i
think
that
pilsner
urquell
is
better
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
pours
out
slightly
darker
than
its
american
counterart
with
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
malt
and
hops
are
both
present
with
a
nice
twang
not
bitter
of
hops
on
the
finish
a
very
nice
pils
i
like
this
better
than
pilsner
urquell
and
its
not
expensive
either
god
i
wish
bud
had
this
much
or
any
flavor
had
this
in
san
fran
over
christmas
vacation
looking
at
my
notes
good
color
golden
slightly
hoppy
with
a
nice
finish
this
as
a
good
summer
beer
cant
wait
to
try
another
as
good
as
pilsner
urguell
in
bottle
elegant
and
slightly
malty
czeck
pils
with
nice
bitterness
to
finish
not
as
good
as
urquell
but
still
damn
nice
i
agree
that
this
beer
may
have
been
over
hyped
but
that
does
not
change
the
fact
that
it
is
a
great
czech
lager
it
has
the
complex
malt
you
expect
along
with
the
herbalcitrisy
hop
im
not
much
of
a
lager
nut
but
i
would
definately
put
this
one
in
my
beer
buying
rotation
the
other
two
would
be
okocim
zagtoba
and
altenmuster
my
sample
was
a
little
skunky
at
first
but
that
dissipated
after
pouring
nicely
malted
but
not
too
sweet
followed
by
a
prickly
hop
finish
thankfully
nothing
like
the
bud
we
know
of
today
that
ab
stole
from
budvar
malty
at
first
rich
flavor
that
insantly
burts
in
your
mouth
mellows
at
the
end
but
overall
is
very
enjoyble
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
czech
republic
almost
all
czech
beers
are
fair
superior
to
what
we
call
beer
in
the
u
s
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
this
looks
solid
the
nose
is
excellent
soft
supple
and
firm
hops
lemony
and
mildly
earthy
work
very
well
with
a
clean
honey
and
bready
malt
character
medium
light
in
body
with
soft
malty
fullness
this
beer
is
clean
crispy
carbonation
long
bready
finish
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
excellent
lemony
hop
flavor
wonderful
pillowy
palate
highly
recommended
o
not
really
impressed
with
this
beer
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
feel
like
i
wasnt
even
drinking
the
same
thing
o
exceptionally
tasty
and
balance
pilsner
it
has
a
nice
sweet
grainy
and
melony
character
that
balances
out
the
dry
bitter
and
crisp
pilsner
character
that
you
normally
expect
drinkability
is
exceptional
as
a
result
this
may
be
the
best
czech
pilsner
ive
ever
had
nearly
perfect
overall
above
average
pilsner
could
be
a
bit
more
dry
and
less
sweetness
far
more
hoppy
in
the
taste
than
in
the
smell
grainy
start
but
it
fades
rapidly
to
the
bittering
hop
the
body
is
not
quite
as
light
as
most
pilsners
long
bitter
aftertaste
refreshing
o
a
solid
czech
pils
with
plenty
of
pilsner
taste
from
the
malts
the
hops
round
everything
out
nicely
and
provide
some
balance
definitely
worth
the
4
price
tag
o
excellent
pilsner
or
course
since
so
many
of
us
have
bmc
to
thank
for
our
intro
to
pilsner
style
beers
this
beer
benefits
from
the
poor
comparison
regardless
im
a
big
fan
of
all
berkshire
products
and
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
especially
during
the
warm
summer
months
overall
an
excellent
pilsner
especially
good
on
a
hot
day
after
a
bike
ride
o
overall
a
solid
offering
from
bbc
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
would
be
excellent
very
refreshing
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
beer
which
is
great
for
the
springsummer
almost
sessionable
just
a
touch
too
high
an
abv
to
be
really
sessionable
for
me
definitely
would
get
this
one
again
appearance
is
straw
yellow
with
one
finger
of
a
white
head
this
czech
pils
has
an
aroma
with
biscuit
malt
some
sugar
a
fairly
basic
smell
but
a
little
better
than
average
tipping
it
back
and
i
taste
malts
some
hops
quite
a
bit
of
bread
the
mouthfeel
here
is
great
very
lowkey
and
crisp
it
has
perfect
carbonation
and
finishes
very
clean
over
the
years
i
grab
a
bomber
from
these
guys
once
in
a
blue
moon
and
this
was
a
good
choice
and
it
went
very
well
with
the
spicy
food
that
i
had
for
dinner
alongside
it
overall
it
had
a
decent
flavor
and
aroma
but
was
nothing
too
special
it
was
rather
simple
and
lacked
much
complexity
good
for
a
easier
drinking
brew
but
nothing
to
really
go
out
of
your
way
for
a
close
to
excellent
american
made
bohemian
pilsner
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
on
cask
at
2
brothers
pours
a
murky
light
orangey
brown
with
very
little
head
no
lacing
light
aroma
of
grass
and
honey
some
sweet
malty
grain
aroma
taste
is
sweet
honey
and
malts
with
some
grass
notes
crisp
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
from
the
cask
very
drinkable
most
pilseners
are
a
bit
boring
to
me
but
this
one
does
have
some
nice
complex
flavors
overall
glad
i
got
to
try
it
on
cask
may
have
to
try
buying
a
bomber
next
time
i
see
it
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
pale
yellow
gold
coloring
with
a
thin
dense
foamy
white
head
floral
nose
both
effervescent
and
slightly
tangy
with
a
touch
of
buttery
sweetness
in
the
background
flavors
are
light
with
a
roastiness
that
comes
in
strong
around
the
midpalate
buttery
and
toasted
grain
backbone
with
some
slight
sour
notes
throughout
all
of
which
overpowers
the
floral
flavors
trying
to
break
through
roasty
aftertaste
on
a
light
round
body
the
carbonation
fights
to
make
it
crisp
but
falls
just
short
sparse
lacing
left
along
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
beer
has
a
roasty
and
smooth
finish
easy
enough
to
drink
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
nice
representation
the
granny
apple
flavoring
took
me
by
surprise
in
a
pleasant
way
odthis
smelled
on
par
with
prima
pils
by
victory
however
it
fell
a
bit
short
for
me
nevertheless
this
was
a
tightly
crafted
pils
and
i
would
choose
it
over
most
from
outside
of
the
u
s
it
displays
the
american
take
on
a
pilsener
this
was
decent
its
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
being
on
draft
at
the
brewery
a
couple
of
years
ago
as
this
kind
of
got
a
little
overly
loose
with
the
sweetness
in
spots
but
things
did
tighten
up
a
bit
the
more
i
worked
it
and
i
was
overall
pleased
with
it
by
the
end
a
worthy
pickup
if
you
see
it
nicely
done
probably
one
of
the
better
session
beers
ive
sampled
in
quite
some
time
overall
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
pilsner
to
date
and
i
think
its
a
homerun
for
its
style
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
and
more
than
a
bargain
at
four
dollars
a
bomber
o
great
example
of
the
style
berkshires
brews
have
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
i
know
i
can
at
least
count
on
their
pilsner
the
beer
pours
a
deep
gold
hazy
color
with
some
very
nice
lacing
left
on
the
glass
with
a
nice
ring
of
head
looks
very
nice
the
smell
is
hardly
there
but
i
do
get
the
twist
of
saaz
hops
and
some
nice
wheaty
bready
and
certainly
grainy
malts
a
clean
overall
smell
just
not
very
strong
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
and
goes
clean
over
the
palate
with
nice
fruity
notes
and
excellent
tasty
semi
sweet
malts
and
fresh
grains
and
a
lemon
twist
of
hops
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
dates
at
the
end
though
its
abruptly
cut
off
with
a
dry
finish
a
classic
clean
and
sudsy
feel
pretty
nice
overall
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beer
id
get
again
great
to
have
while
watching
football
d
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
but
rather
unremarkable
at
the
same
time
steady
and
quite
average
i
would
never
turn
a
shot
at
this
one
down
in
the
future
but
this
is
far
from
the
top
tier
of
the
style
in
my
humble
opinion
nice
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
nice
beer
after
cutting
your
lawn
o
easily
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
tried
incredibly
flavorful
as
well
as
dry
and
refreshing
o
a
decent
pilsner
though
nothing
amazing
overall
what
a
beautiful
summer
beer
this
is
walking
into
a
small
pizza
joint
to
get
out
of
the
heat
on
a
90
degree
summer
day
and
ending
up
with
this
in
my
glass
is
very
satisfying
great
beer
and
as
perfectly
seasonal
as
food
or
drink
can
be
poured
a
2
5
white
head
hazy
straw
yellow
color
the
flavor
profile
is
typical
bmc
all
the
way
too
me
just
a
little
stronger
and
smoother
and
i
kind
of
wonder
if
that
isnt
more
to
the
credit
of
it
being
a
fresher
and
constantly
refrigerated
version
of
a
pilsner
yes
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
repeat
but
as
far
as
the
build
of
the
beer
goes
id
still
just
call
it
a
little
above
average
overall
not
a
dislike
for
me
but
i
do
prefer
other
brewers
of
this
style
o
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
offering
from
berkshire
brewing
company
always
good
to
support
local
and
with
beers
like
this
they
make
it
very
easy
o
a
nice
balanced
pilsener
with
an
authentic
czech
feel
to
it
saaz
hops
are
the
subtle
star
of
the
show
and
bready
earthy
milled
floor
malts
add
enough
substance
to
keep
it
a
nice
hot
weather
brew
not
a
ton
of
interest
on
a
normal
basis
but
bbc
did
a
fine
job
here
pours
light
amber
darker
than
a
typical
pils
white
foamy
leaving
a
full
layer
pilsy
smell
but
mild
cleab
malty
flavor
subtle
hop
some
citrus
clean
finish
a
little
sweet
if
anything
a
good
beer
not
great
at
5
i
believe
this
is
the
lowest
it
gets
from
bbc
in
terms
of
abv
this
makes
it
very
drinkable
and
very
sessionable
however
at
this
price
point
522oz
its
not
likely
that
ill
enjoy
more
than
one
at
a
time
if
this
ends
up
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
i
imagine
itll
be
one
of
the
better
values
available
give
it
a
try
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
this
was
not
a
bad
brew
but
something
i
juts
really
didnt
like
bbc
you
make
a
fine
brew
truly
o
perfect
summer
beer
this
might
just
be
my
new
favorite
summer
seasonal
its
so
simple
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
22
oz
of
summer
another
winner
from
bbc
overall
this
is
one
of
berkshires
finest
offerings
expertly
crafted
and
i
have
to
say
better
than
prima
pils
in
my
opinion
less
hops
but
better
crafted
overall
great
beer
to
sit
in
a
lawnchair
and
admire
your
freshly
manicured
lawn
though
berkshire
specializes
in
englishstyle
ales
they
make
great
lagers
when
they
put
their
minds
to
it
drinks
well
could
probably
be
a
bit
more
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
solid
like
most
of
bbc
o
berkshire
has
again
balanced
a
beer
between
strict
representation
to
style
and
its
own
siganture
a
great
seasonal
seek
it
out
and
enjoy

with

certainly
nothing
offputting
though
flavor
is
good
though
im
a
sucker
for
this
style
very
good
balance
between
malt
and
hops
this
comes
off
as
fresh
and
bright
with
a
short
crisp
finish
super
nice
flavor
here
not
as
grassy
as
many
czech
pils
but
the
balance
and
profile
is
superb
a
lot
of
people
will
pass
this
one
over
as
its
not
super
exciting
but
its
quite
well
crafted
a
very
berkshire
brew
its
not
outstanding
but
really
solid
traditional
and
good
example
of
style
i
like
it
and
hopefully
ill
see
it
on
taps
around
boston
soon
as
steel
rail
and
coffehaus
seem
to
dominate
d
overall
a
pretty
good
american
example
of
this
style
while
not
up
to
the
best
czech
and
german
versions
and
not
even
the
best
us
version
it
is
quite
tasty
and
a
good
summer
thirst
quencher
think
the
rest
of
this
is
gonna
go
well
with
the
burger
that
is
just
finishing
on

with

is
very
nice
yet
another
good
brew
from

goes
down
very
easily
not
too

mild
kick
very
good
representation
of

this
is
a
very
good
sessionable
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
drinkability
complex
balanced
and
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
that
it
is
a
great
addition
to
the
berkshire
seasonal
lineup
the
aroma
has
hints
of
the
grassy
spicy
hops
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
the
sweet
malt
upon
first
sip
youre
hit
with
those
hops
as
it
lingers
in
your
mouth
you
get
the
nice
sweeter
malt
flavors
its
really
hard
to
describe
their
flavor
as
they
dont
hang
around
too
long
before
the
flavor
turns
back
to
the
hops
and
leaves
a
nice
dryness
its
really
hard
to
stop
drinking
this
one
the
carbonation
in
this
beer
though
relatively
effervescent
in
the
glass
is
more
mild
in
the
mouth
though
you
can
feel
it
tingle
a
bit
on
your
tongue
it
helps
this
beer
go
down
easy
keeping
it
refreshing
while
it
may
not
be
huge
inyourface
flavor
its
just
the
perfect
amount
of
flavor
with
a
nice
dry
finish
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
beer
needed
on
such
a
beautiful
day
i
see
myself
buying
more
of
this
beer
in
the
future
its
another
excellent
beer
from
a
great
brewery
plenty
drinkable
low
abv
helps
for
sure
but
its
just
good
stuff
drink
it
cold
drink
it
slow
or
suck
em
down
however
you
want
to
do
this
is
a
good
pils
tastes
like
a
good
pils
should
if
there
were
beers
that
could
completely
displace
adjuncts
given
the
exposure
stuff
like
this
would
do
the
job
drinkability
is
great
on
this
one
could
drink
em
all
day
long
f
finishes
very
clean
and
crisp
just
as
it
should
a
slight
lingering
sticky
feel
takes
away
from
it
a
bit
some
lingering
toasty
malts
and
lager
flavors
as
well
as
that
dry
lager
yeast
like
straw
slight
saison
etc
flavor
is
there
just
a
tad
a
slight
bitterness
in
there
too
and
the
slightest
memory
of
the
noble
hops
as
well
as
a
mild
grassy
hop
taste
mostly
dry
but
that
slight
sticky
sweetness
sticks
perhaps
the
only
flaw
overall
the
bomber
went
away
fast
try
this
if
you
like
the
style
i
hope
this
becomes
a
yearrounder
you
guys
at
bbc
had
me
at
negative
many
years
ago
but
have
brewed
your
way
back
into
my
favor
drink
this
well
i
think
i
have
found
my
new
favorite
summer
brew
glad
that
bbc
is
sticking
to
their
guns
and
brewing
great
beers
to
style
this
is
no
exception
phenomenal
as
a
regular
fan
of
bbc
brews
i
was
not
surprised
by
the
overall
tone
of
their
take
on
a
german
style
subtle
where
other
american
breweries
are
harsh
understated
where
others
are
hamhanded
a
quicklydisappearing
cottonball
head
let
loose
with
waves
of
hops
and
oranges
and
a
distinct
cloud
of
malt
sweetness
more
of
same
in
the
taste
with
some
grassy
flavors
that
rounded
things
out
nicely
no
overhopped
sting
at
the
end
no
syrupy
suffocation
from
the
malt
at
the
beginning
it
could
have
been
a
wee
bit
drier
in
the
finish
but
thats
a
quibble
this
was
also
slightly
undercarbonated
for
my
taste
but
still
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
evening
worth
seeking
out
while
its
available
clear
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
cap
good
head
retention
lots
of
sticky
lacing
clung
to
the
glass
very
hoppy
aroma
floral
and
slightly
fruity
lemon
zest
with
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
slight
sulfur
character
as
well
hiding
behind
the
hops
is
a
delicate
maltiness
thats
easy
to
miss
at
first
bitterness
was
present
throughout
balanced
rather
than
being
up
front
and
bracing
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
of
a
bitterness
kick
from
the
hops
but
it
ended
up
working
with
this
beer
and
there
was
certainly
a
lot
of
hop
flavour
jammed
in
here
floral
for
the
most
part
with
a
fruity
and
spicy
finish
clean
maltiness
provided
a
bit
of
sweetness
dry
and
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
crisp
quite
good
much
better
than
most
lagers
being
churned
out
by
otherwise
respectable
craft
breweries
in
the
us
other
than
several
in
pa
and
a
solid
pils
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
be
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
in
the
near
future
cheers
d
this
one
goes
down
extremely
easylike
water
only
much
more
delicious
it
makes
me
glad
that
i
have
5
gallons
of
it
on
tap
still
i
dont
think
this
is
going
to
last
me
very
long
overall
it
wasnt
a
bad
pilsener
and
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
on
tap
as
bbc
doesnt
do
many
lagers
nice
beer
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
which
might
be
expected
but
still
makes
the
experience
suffer
slightly
sweet
definitely
can
taste
the
citrus
bright
and
fuzzy
with
enough
hops
to
make
it
intersting
love

adams
full
bodied
and
refreshing
wish
the
abv
was
higher
but
typical
for
a
pilsner
a
very
solid
pilsner
even
if
doesnt
break
new
ground
was
not
picking
up
much
citrus
here
mostly
grassypine
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
very
nicely
hopped
with
citrus
on
the
front
end
and
a
floral
finish
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
very
tasty
not
the
best
in
class
but
not
the
worst
either
i
could
drink
this
again
i
just
dont
get
it
i
dont
enjoy
a
single
thing
about
this
beer
and
its
lauded
as
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
has
to
produce
oh
well
good
taste
and
a
good
quality
pilsener
i
love
this
beer
just
the
right
about
of
malthop
balance
here
i
can
drink
this
on
any
occasion
a
very
nice
entrant
into
an
underappreciated
category
has
a
lot
of
taste
for
a
pilsner
o
this
is
hands
down
the
most
refreshing
czech
pilsner
ive
had
it
has
less
body
than
most
others
ive
tried
less
hops
than
a
few
but
that
is
a
good
thing
sometimes
tastes
remarkably
like
boston
later
too
o
really
good
pilsner
from
sam
co
theres
stuff
in
there
and
quality
stuff
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
i
drink
this
occasionally
and
will
continue
to
purchase
it
among
the
best
lager
beers
ive
drunk
very
well
made
beer
good
job
jim
koch
nice
head
and
lacing
this
beer
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
and
lacks
a
little
of
the
hops
i
wanted
overall
a
touch
of
citrus
and
a
well
balanced
flavor
another
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
you
cant
go
wrong
with
anything
they
brew
not
as
good
as
the
hopology
series
but
right
up
there
though
overall
really
nice
pilsner
from
sam
adams
very
quaffable
and
refreshing
while
also
having
some
nice
hop
and
citrus
flavors
one
of
the
better
domestic
europeanstyle
pilsners
ive
had
and
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
offerings
overall
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
well
balanced
taste
the
hops
are
flavoursome
without
being
overpowering
and
linger
on
the
palate
brilliantly
clear
golden
with
a
foamy
thin
layer
of
white
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
sweet
with
a
floral
bent
and
a
touch
of
earthy
minerals
malt
sweetness
seems
dominant
flavor
is
lemony
and
minerally
upfront
finishing
earthy
and
lightly
bitter
theres
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
at
the
backbone
finishing
crackery
and
dry
very
easy
drinking
approachable
beer
with
a
balanced
malt
and
hop
profile
noble
pils
is
a
truly
unique
beer
whose
taste
never
ends
slightly
on
the
thin
side
as
far
as
mouthfeel
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
not
as
good
as
i
remember
but
this
is
my
base
for
pale
beers
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
great
use
of
all
five
noble
hops
in
a
great
balance
with
bohemian
malted
barley
the
appearance
is
great
the
smell
is
good
but
the
taste
is
better
a
typical
boston
beer
brew
not
over
the
top
but
by
no
means
bad
pours
a
clear
golden
witha
substantial
foamy
white
head
that
hangs
around
decent
lacing
smells
of
grass
bread
hops
and
a
but
of
citrus
those
follow
through
to
the
taste
the
hops
provide
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
mouth
is
light
with
some
carbonation
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
person
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
amazing
drink
and
i
think
sam
adams
should
keep
up
their
good
work
o
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
from
sa
at
the
price
point
its
at
though
a
good
bang
for
your
buck
when
you
want
something
better
awesome
beer
d
tasty
beer
a
very
refreshing
pils
with
a
nice
hop
bite
on
it
one
of
the
bbcs
better
concoctions
a
real
noble
effort
i
must
sayhmm
bwhahaha
served
from
bottle
into
pilsner
glass
glear
golden
yellow
appearance
lots
of
carbonation
white
fluffy
merengue
type
3
finger
head
that
laces
the
glass
pretty
well
the
smell
is
grassy
almost
hay
like
strong
crackery
notes
from
the
pilsner
malts
and
earthyness
from
the
noble
hops
although
the
saaz
hop
note
stands
out
most
the
taste
is
big
cracker
bready
taste
up
front
follwed
by
just
the
right
hop
zing
that
you
would
expect
in
a
great
czech
pils
carbonation
washes
the
pallet
well
and
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
overall
this
a
great
offering
from
samuel
adams
definatlly
one
of
my
favorites
cheers
this
ale
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
lasts
throughout
the
pour
the
nose
is
very
light
with
notes
of
belgian
yeast
light
citrus
hops
and
fresh
wheat
the
flavor
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
its
not
a
complex
beer
but
this
style
shouldnt
be
it
is
easy
in
the
palate
simple
not
too
much
malt
or
hops
just
balanced
and
easy
going
this
isnt
a
beer
that
id
seek
out
but
one
that
is
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
o
not
as
crisp
as
other
pilsners
but
exceptional
just
the
same
it
is
more
rounded
due
to
the
malt
presence
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
would
definitely
buy
again
a
outstanding
beer
at
a
great
price
o
i
was
surprised
at
first
because
the
taste
didnt
necessarily
reflect
the
aroma
at
first
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
hoppy
this
pils
is
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
the
bitterness
and
dryness
combines
for
a
complementary
bite
that
leaves
the
drinker
wanting
another
sip
o
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
representation
of
a
czech
pilsner
wish
it
was
a
tad
crisper
but
i
could
definitely
session
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
a
delightful
interpretation
of
the
pils
standard
refreshing
flavorful
delicately
balanced
one
of
the
best
ive
had
o
i
really
wasnt
expecting
much
my
son
picked
this
one
at
random
in
a
mixed
6er
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
good
example
of
a
czech
pilsener
o
decent
pils
not
as
good
as
i
once
remembered
but
decent
enough
to
get
you
buy
in
a
pinch
great
beer
poured
with
a
lasting
one
finger
head
lime
and
orange
aroma
with
hints
of
pine
and
light
cracker
malt
the
taste
is
well
balanced
a
distinctive
cracker
malt
flavor
orange
pine
and
lime
in
the
hops
clean
fermentation
medium
body
and
carbonation
finishes
dry
a
very
drinkable
beer
well
balanced
o
this
is
a
hop
forward
version
of
a
pilsner
while
still
retaining
the
characteristic
crisp
drinkability
that
comes
out
of
this
style
of
beer
it
is
like
a
czech
pilsner
but
hopped
like
an
apa
with
noble
hops
it
could
easily
have
been
overhopped
and
unbalanced
but
this
beer
keeps
it
just
right
this
is
my
favorite
brew
from
sam
adams
hands
down
it
has
a
great
lemony
citrus
hop
bite
and
is
so
crisp
and
clean
tasting
the
malts
are
slightly
bready
and
make
for
a
creamy
mouthfeel
although
the
hops
provide
a
snappy
super
dry
finish
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
with
food
or
by
itself
it
is
a
treat
every
time
get
some
now
it
is
good
every
season
of
the
year
o
a
nice
pilsner
but
not
on
the
level
of
some
of
the
top
ones
in
my
opinion
this
one
does
have
a
very
unique
flavor
though
and
a
great
crisp
feel
worth
a
try
for
a
pilsner
fan
o
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
ive
had
it
before
and
i
thought
it
was
good
then
too
guess
this
one
kind
of
gets
lost
in
the
shuffle
a
bit
id
put
it
in
my
top
5
from
the
boston
beer
company
an
outstanding
pils
that
could
pass
for
any
quality
euro
pils
in
a
blind
taste
test
pretty
decent
offering
from
sam
adams
good
golden
color
even
though
the
head
is
weak
fresh
and
crisp
lemony
taste
bold
mouthfeel
overall
pretty
good
but
not
the
best
imho
from
the
king
of
the
microbrewery
i
will
say
its
good
compared
to
most
other
pilsners
out
there
way
to
go
sa
12oz
bottle
1
49
heavy
yellow
color
decent
head
a
bit
of
lacing
mild
citrus
aroma
touch
of
minerals
flavor
is
honey
citrus
and
something
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
pils
still
worth
the
money
if
its
the
freshest
beer
in
the
liquor
store
which
happens
some
times
in
the
hood
o
as
a
pilsner
this
beer
is
quite
delicious
samuel
adams
creates
their
own
version
and
i
believe
it
stands
quite
nicely
has
a
munich
helles
lager
quality
this
is
a
prefect
drink
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
glad
this
is
no
longer
a
seasonal
so
i
can
have
some
in
the
fridge
yearround
definitely
think
this
is
one
of
bbcs
best
beers
the
beer
pours
a
clean
pale
urineyellow
color
a
tight
white
head
of
small
bubbles
forms
to
a
about
a
half
fingers
width
and
then
fizzles
to
a
scrim
the
head
leaves
a
sticky
lacing
of
thin
holeridden
sheets
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
lager
clean
and
full
of
nicelypaced
bubbles
that
feed
the
head
no
particles
are
present
in
the
beer
and
it
seems
entirely
free
of
any
haze
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
delicate
crisp
and
hoppy
with
noble
spice
a
strong
light
caramel
note
gives
the
nose
a
light
stickiness
while
still
remaining
delicate
herbal
grass
and
light
dankness
can
also
be
sensed
in
the
beer
nicely
showcasing
the
noble
hops
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
soft
and
floral
sweet
gentle
bitterness
touches
the
palate
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
and
carries
on
into
the
finish
providing
some
nice
balance
the
sweetness
does
incorporate
some
fruitier
aspects
and
a
light
citric
acidity
can
be
sensed
on
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
but
in
all
his
beer
is
delicate
and
balanced
the
beer
feels
light
in
body
with
a
crisp
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
and
a
soft
carbonation
that
still
carries
a
little
bite
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
begins
as
light
grass
and
flowers
with
a
soft
spice
caramel
and
cracker
malt
move
in
after
a
while
bringing
with
them
a
sweet
almost
apple
juice
flavor
that
i
sometimes
detect
in
pilsners
faint
salt
character
can
be
detected
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
finish
is
softly
citric
lemon
peel
with
a
touch
of
cracker
and
grass
the
aftertaste
is
mellow
cracker
malt
overall
this
is
a
nicely
reserved
beer
with
some
great
balance
the
apple
juice
sweetness
does
briefly
get
a
little
too
much
for
the
subtlety
of
the
style
but
never
too
much
so
the
beer
is
soft
and
perfect
for
a
fatigued
palate
or
a
midweek
drink
o
feels
like
a
standard
czech
pilsener
perhaps
a
little
better
than
average
also
this
bottle
says
best
by
this
month
so
it
may
be
a
few
months
old
and
have
lost
some
hop
bite
overall
its
good
but
i
think
it
used
to
be
better
o
i
really
like
this
beer
and
feel
as
though
its
one
of
the
better
czech
pils
on
the
market
with
all
these
strange
lagers
labeling
themselves
as
a
pils
when
really
theyre
closes
to
an
aal
sam
adams
is
up
to
some
good
stuff
lately
i
love
the
hopology
collection
and
right
now
im
sipping
on
the
noble
pils
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
foam
head
the
aroma
is
of
grassy
earth
and
hops
taste
is
nice
a
hoppy
version
of
a
czech
pils
give
this
one
a
try
for
sure
and
the
best
part
is
that
its
available
in
all
major
grocery
stores
cheers
served
in
pokal
o
this
is
a
very
clean
refreshing
and
dry
pilsner
i
could
knock
these
back
while
cutting
grass
grilling
or
just
hanging
out
its
that
good
o
a
true
stand
out
for
such
a
large
brewery
hop
flavors
are
remarkably
pronounced
while
nailing
the
style
to
the
tee
highly
suggest
to
try
on
tap
as
the
hop
profile
tends
to
be
even
more
pungent
to
the
point
easy
to
drink
no
strong
flavors
to
interfere
with
different
types
of
foods
first
few
sips
i
was
not
impressed
but
as
the
ale
warmed
the
flavors
seemed
to
pop
a
little
still
mildmedium
for
a
hoppy
beer
o
i
hadnt
had
this
beer
in
a
while
and
its
better
than
i
remembered
have
been
having
a
hard
time
finding
it
lately
hope
it
continues
to
be
made
year
round
refreshing
yet
tasty
this
can
be
a
session
beer
yet
still
satisfy
when
you
simply
want
to
relax
and
have
a
damn
good
tasting
beer
highly
recommend
this
is
very
floral
to
me
but
has
the
odd
bitterness
of
dandelions
in
it
its
enjoyable
but
far
from
fantastic
the
lemon
is
in
the
scent
the
taste
is
something
citrusy
but
only
lightly
there
nice
summer
drink
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
with
so
many
better
options
update
ive
had
a
few
more
sixpacks
of
this
one
and
some
other
lesser
beers
in
between
i
think
that
in
hindsight
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
at
first
by
this
beer
but
it
is
more
than
fine
and
it
is

and
some

i
am
not
a
pilsner
fan
and
sam
adams
typically
disappoints
but
this
is
the
only
pilsner
i
find
palatable
its
not
amazing
but
it
works
if
i
go
to
a
bar
and
this
is
all
they

with

there
is
way
too
much
yeast

not

it
is

wont

stands
out

of
the

beers

just
wasnt

very
fresh

had

see
through
yellow
you
get
the
bright
citrus
hops
in
the
smell
and
taste
which
is
a
weird
hop
taste
that
ive
tasted
in
no
other
beer
but
still
good
if
you
like
hops
the
malt
is
there
with
that
pilsner
malt
taste
but
i
remember
them
saying
they
used
to
do
something
special
to
the
malts
in
this
beer
but
now
they
dont
even
mention
it
maybe
because
they
didnt
do
it
in
this
years
version
i
dont
know
im
also
getting
a
slight
alcohol
taste
and
smell
since
there
isnt
that
much
to
cover
it
up
but
the
hops
do
the
best
job
they
can
to
mask
it
and
they
do
to
an
extent
definitely
a
good
beer
for
the
spring

you
want
a
hoppy
pilsner
that
is
comparable
to

drinking
pils
if
it
is
what
you
are
in
the
mood
for
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
wasnt
half
bad
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
unoffensive
hopped
pilsner
this
is
a
brew
that
would
be
great
to
session
and
great
for
someone
who
isnt
a
hop
head
but
is
working
their
way
towarss
becoming
one
taste
this
is
a
really
good
beer
for
the

light
enough
to
drink
in
the
hot
sun
while
still
having
a
lot
of
flavor
to
it
im
very
impressed
by
this
sam
adams
as
ive
been
underwelmed
by
some
of
their
experiments
in
the
past
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
two
or
three
may
be
the
limit
as
it
seems
to
leave
a
sticky
taste
in
my
mouth
well
done
bbc
this
one
impressed
me
for
sure
i
like
the
multi
hop
twist
on
this
new
pils
dont
drink
and
review
robust
body
accentuates
the
flavors
this
is
a
german
pils
to
love
very
good
drinker
on
its
own
as
a
quaffer
and
with
savory
foods
a
noble
try
for
the
big
guys
who
are
still
under
1
of
the
us
market
keep
it
up
guys
d
for
a
beer
that
has
hops
as
the
center
show
and
coming
from
a
guy
who
does
not
like
hops
this
one
is
a
easy
drink
itll
be
my
pick
for
the
hot
sunny
days
when
i
dont
feel
like
a
sweet
malty
brew
light
bodied
with
carbonation
leaning
towards
mediumheavy
i
though
noble
pils
was
quite
delicious
the
hops
are
showcased
well
and
really
tout
the
noble
hop
characteristics
with
a
subtle
yet
supportive
role
played
by
the
malts
a
good
simple
beer
clean
and
refreshing
without
skimping
on
taste
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
especially
for
parties
or
if
i
need
to
get
back
to
basics
recommended
drinkability
good
tasting
session
beer
its
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
back
d
its
good
peeps
i
dig
it
it
seems
that
sam
adams
brews
tend
to
be
hit
or
miss
at
times
but
this
one
is
a
hit
has
that
hops
presence
and
complexity
but
its
not
over
the
top
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
get
people
interested
and
more
aquainted
with
hops
pretty
well
crafted
beer
that
has
accessibilty
and
drinkability
really
enjoy
it
and
glad
i
have
more
in
the
fridge
d
the
low
alcohol
make
this
an
easy
drinker
and
good
for
the
warmer
months
drinkability
i
rate
this
high
because
i
could
really
drink
this
beer
alot
more
at
one
time
than
many
other
beers
that
ive
ever
had
i
could
really
get
into
these
during
a
summer
saturday
doing
some
yardwork
notes
probably
my
favorite
of
all
sa
newer
beers
i
havent
found
too
many
really
tasty
cheap
pilsners
out
there
but
this
one
is
great
overall
nice
pilsner
style
brew
with
a
ton
going
on
falls
nicely
within
the
style
parameters
but
the
addition
of
all
5
noble
hops
really
gives
this
brew
layers
of
complexity
definitely
worth
a
try
and
this
brew
shows
that
sam
adams
has
still
got
it
notes
nice
examply
easy
to
drink
quite
drinkable
and
actually
very
welcome
after
a
long
winter
of
porters
and
stouts
and
barleywines
and
holiday
ales
perfect
for
the
grill
bottle
pours
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
some
simple
lacing
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
touch
of
hop
spice
flavor
is
light
refreshing
slightly
grainy
a
touch
of
hop
spice
leads
to
a
really
dry
finish
not
too
much
body
really
overall
not
bad
but
i
have
to
remember
this
is
just
a
pilsner
sam
adams
seems
to
have
pulled
off
generally
a
simple
beer
and
added
just
a
little
something
special
overall
this
is
one
of
samuel
adams
better
beers
and
very
affordable
a
seasonal
release
to
look
forward
to
drinkability
a
fine
beer
that
you
can
drink
all
night
a
very
solid
brew
here
and
a
nice
surprise
from
sam
adams
its
not
quite
prima
pils
which
has
the
edge
in
hoppiness
but
this
is
a
suitable
substitute
anytime
sam
adams
needs
to
quit
making
blackberry
nonsense
and
useless
coastal
wheat
beers
and
perfect
noble
pils
with
some
tweaking
this
could
be
a
widely
distributed
classic
it
can
easily
hold
its
own
with
all
but
the
best
pils
out
there
and
is
welcome
in
my
fridge
anytime
go
get
some
and
drink
it
while
basking
in
the
spring
sun
with
happy
people
youll
thank
me
overall
ok
nothing
special
i
really

light

gentle

crisp
d
a
good
representation
of

good
drinkability
but
nothing
really
stands
out
too
much
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
and
would
get
it
again
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
excellent
clarity
and
a
nice
little
white
head
that
retains
ok
the
aroma
is
really
nice
on
this
one
with
a
huge
mintyherbalfloral
noble
hop
character
upfront
along
with
a
doughy
maltiness
really
clean
and
distinct
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
big
hoppy
blast
minty
spicy
floral
a
maltiness
that
resembles
bread
dough
and
a
clean
dry
finish
this
is
kind
of
a
one
trick
pony
but
its
a
damn
good
trick
drinkability
is
excellent
i
could
drink
this
sucker
all
night
this
is
an
impeccable
spring
beer
its
very
clean
and
tasty
and
perfect
for
warmer
weather
drinkability
although
the
hops
are
constrained
for
the
masses
this
beer
is
exceedingly
drinkable
i
would
prefer
to
see
it
throughout
the
warmer
months
rather
than
as
a
spring
seasonal
which
by
todays
standards
means
that
is
a
late
winter
beer
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
pizza
went
out
for
pizza
at
aurelios
in
homewood
il
last
friday
nite
and
wow
the
noble
pils
was
sensational
the
best
part
of
this
brew
are
the
finishing
bite
and
the
drinkability
im
sorry
this
is
only
a
seasonal
release
by
sam
adams
bottom
line
i
had
a
noble
pils
from
the
tap
in
february
a
month
later
i
can
detect
a
notable
drop
in
potency
from
those
little
resinous
cones
if
the
brain
trust
at
bbc
wants
to
continue
releasing
this
beer
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
i
would
suggest
hopping
the
shit
out
of
it
that
way
it
would
provide
a
nice
bracing
bitterness
for
the
early
adopters
who
are
likely
batypes
anyways
and
the
beer
could
melt
into
a
pleasantly
drinkable
pilsner
by
april
when
the
snow
is
well
melting
into
slush
be
that
as
it
may
i
found
this
midmarch
pilsner
a
pleasant
slog
and
would
gladly
reup
my
glass
with
another
d
i
think
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
release
this
beer
so
early
this
would
be
a
very
enjoyable
summertime
beer
it
seems
to
be
crafted
for
summer
and
it
would
provide
a
flavorful
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
on
even
the
hottest
days
overall
not
a
bad
brew
let
me
start
by
saying
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
perfect
for
a
beautiful
sunny
spring
colorado
afternoon
pours
into
the
glass
a
bright
sunny
deep
golden
hue
topped
with
a
lovely
rocky
white
head
smells
strongly
of
citrus
lemons
and
grapefruits
mainly
on
the
palate
a
slight
breadiness
is
lifted
up
by
the
lemon
spiciness
not
tremendously
complex
but
delicious
enjoyable
and
everything
a
lawnmower
beer
could
ever
want
to
be
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
its
not
as
straightforward
or
as
pilsenerformula
abiding
as
i
expected
yet
the
result
is
not
something
that
alienates
relatively
conservative
preferences
people
like
me
have
d
very
quaffable
but
gets
dinged
for
feeling
a
bit
too
heavy
overall
this
is
maybe
a
slightly
above
average
pilsener
there
are
definitely
lots
of
others
i
would
drink
before
this
one
i
have
to
admit
i
am
not
usually
a
samuel
adams
kind
of
guy
most
of
their
beers
do
very
little
for
me
but
this
one
however
is
absolute
pilsner
heaven
they
nailed
it
ive
only
had
it
on
draught
and
am
afraid
the
bottle
might
disappoint
but
if
you
can
get
it
fresh
this
beer
is
sure
to
please
the
malt
backbone
is
solid
perfectly
balanced
with
a
nice
firm
bitterness
and
the
best
part
is
the
late
addition
flavoraroma
of
those
famed
noble
hops
really
rounds
this
beer
off
perfectly
this
is
currently
one
of
my
favorites
i
only
wish
it
was
available
year
round
cheers
to
boston
brewing
well
done
overall
i
cant
believe
they
traded
white
ale
for
this
makes
me
want
to
cry
ive
been
drinking
sam
adams
since
inception
i
honestly
feel
this
is
their
shining
hour
i
literally
cant
get
enough
i
was
sceptical
after
so
many
fruity
and
spicy
disappointments
in
the
past
but
this
made
up
for
all
of
them
i
look
forward
to
my
daily
ration
as
a
british
sailor
for
his
grog
this
should
be
a
year
round
product
the
best
ever
highly
enjoyable
one
of
sam
adams
better
efforts
here
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
july
notched
onto
the
label
pours
clear
golden
near
white
head
quickly
goes
to
a
tiny
bubble
film
and
collar
with
minor
lacing
minor
citric
nose
pleasant
enough
but
nothing
real
special
here
has
the
typical
pilsner
grassy
crisp
thing
goin
on
which
never
does
anything
real
special
for
me
or
my
taste
buds
sessionable
ill
give
it
that
if
you
like
pilsner
yeah
i
said
it
d
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
great
beer
for
the
spring
time
which
is
actually
ironic
that
i
spoke
with
the
sam
adams
rep
today
and
they
said
it
is
almost
gone
and
they
are
already
changing
the
seasonal
over
to
the
summer
ale
a
little
premature
for
me
but
that
is
what
she
said
overall
lighter
alternative
to
an
ipa
touches
the
hop
button
but
doesnt
overpower
light
body
and
moderate
abv
makes
it
a
great
session
beer
overall
the
beer
does
what
the
brewery
says
it
will
i
conjures
images
of
spring
it
is
a
very
drinkable
light
bodied
beer
that
will
be
enjoyed
by
beer
drinkers
who
really
like
to
taste
their
hops
throughout
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
very
easy
drinker
that
goes
great
with
pizza
burgers
etc
nice
job
sam
d
this
was
an
average
beer
i
was
disappointed
in
the
nose
to
be
certain
but
it
tasted
much
better
the
refreshment
factor
is
pretty
high
but
there
are
many
beers
i
would
prefer
in
the
same
price
range
d
i
was
pretty
upset
that
the
white
ale
was
being
replaced
by
this
but
after
finally
having
it
its
not
too
big
of
a
loss
this
is
enjoyable
for
beer
lovers
and
the
occasional
beer
drinker
a
solid
offering
from
sa
i
must
say
nice
bodied
too
a
tad
oily
but
for
the
most
part
well
carbonated
and
not
thin
but
satisfyingly
lightbodied
and
it
goes
down
well
kudos
again
to
the
sa
this
is
just
another
micro
in
macro
sheeps
clothing
boo
sam
that
12
ounce
bottle
went
down
fast
i
still
prefer
boston
lager
over
this
but
the
noble
pils
warrants
a
future
12pack
purchase
for
lazy
drinking
and
good
costbenefit
at
the
very
least
its
better
than
the
deceased
sa
white
ale
but
why
this
was
released
in
january
for
the
spring
season
is
beyond
me
drinkability
it
is
nice
to
see
a
lighter
style
of
beer
use
a
good
amount
of
hops
in
it
that
said
i
would
have
liked
for
there
to
have
been
a
more
balanced
hops
taste
rather
than
just
achieving
a
bitter
flavor
in
the
brew
i
cannot
detect
any
significant
piney
or
floral
hop
tastesmell
and
i
would
have
preferred
a
mixture
of
these
tastes
overall
still
a
good
beer
if
your
at
a
barbeque
or
enjoying
the
warm
weather
somewhere
i
see
some
bad
reviews
for
this
on
here
i
have
to
wonder
if
there
were
maybe
some
bad
batches
by
that
i
mean
giving
this
less
than
a
5
in
aroma
is
crazy
this
is
by
far
the
best
smelling
beer
i
have
ever
put
my
nose
to
smells
like
a
noble
ipa
hardly
any
ipas
pack
that
much
aroma
in
the
nose
maybe
odells
in
colorado
is
close
the
appearance
is
light
and
yellow
but
i
dont
see
that
a
downside
like
many
it
could
be
purple
if
it
tasted
and
smelled
this
good
i
drove
90
miles
twice
in
one
week
to
get
more
i
will
drive
it
again
and
buy
as
much
as
i
can
before
it
goes
off
season
which
will
be
incredibly
dissapointing
this
is
desert
island
beer
i
could
drink
this
and
this
alone
every
day
if
pushed
as
far
as
mouthfeel
its
average
but
its
a
lagerpilsner
so
its
right
in
line
with
the
style
d
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
beers
although
this
isnt
that
strong
i
cant
see
myself
ever
turning
this
into
a
session
beer
sam
has
a
worthy
offering
here
after
the
last
few
new
brews
i
sampled
from
these
guys
let
me
down
just
a
bit
its
not
for
the
novice
dinker
but
for
anyone
who
can
appreciate
a
good
beer
that
isnt
too
overly
complex
theres
no
need
to
look
any
further
sure
i
like
my
spring
beers
to
be
cloudy
and
a
bit
spicy
but
this
fits
the
season
well
and
surely
will
make
me
take
pride
in
my
beer
for
the
first
time
in
a
while
cheers
to
sam
for
brewing
this
and
shaking
up
their
portfolio
this
is
a
delicious
warmweather
brew
and
one
that
deserves
repeat
purchase
d
not
a
bad
example
of
a
hoppy
pilsner
not
that
i
have
much
experience
with
said
beers
i
didnt
get
much
floral
or
piney
hop
flavor
mainly
the
lemon
which
kind
of
got
stuck
in
my
head
as
i
drank
the
beer
it
was
enjoyable
but
not
generally
in
my
style
range
i
wouldnt
complain
about
drinking
this
at
a
party
or
in
the
airport
but
wouldnt
pick
up
a
sixer
of
it
d
i
found
the
bitter
finish
kind
of
addicting
ive
actually
been
on
a
binge
with
this
beer
ontap
lately
i
am
just
now
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
from
sam
adams
d
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
it
really
is
a
quality
example
of
the
style
so
much
flavor
and
yet
so
subtle
and
simple
drinkability
is
superb
a
very
nicely
done
pilsner
from
sam
adams
very
malty
yet
very
much
drinkability
good
stuff
all
around
great
hops
drinkable
refreshing
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
hoppy
pilsners
while
this
would
not
be
an
overly
hoppy
beer
if
it
were
an
ipa
it
maybe
on
par
hopwise
with
some
apas
it
is
on
the
hoppybitter
side
of
the
malthops
balance
of
flavors
unfortunately
i
do
not
think
that
many
pils
drinkers
want
a
beer
this
hopcentric
i
passed
on
buying
this
beer
when
it
first
showed
in
my
area
but
lack
of
new
beers
to
try
and
a
sale
price
tempted
me
to
try
it
i
am
glad
i
did
now
i
am
working
on
my
third
as
i
write
this
and
noticed
the
third
bottle
is
two
months
older
than
the
previous
tastes
imo
you
should
look
for
the
freshest
bottles
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
this
last
bottle
was
much
less
rich
in
the
flavor
department
mediumbodied
maybe
a
little
liberal
with
the
carbonation
but
very
easydrinking
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pils
more
flavor
than
many
pilseners
out
there
thanks
to
the
noble
hops
slightly
floral
aroma
mixed
in
with
the
hops
the
flavor
was
much
more
complex
with
a
very
distinct
hop
flavor
with
a
smooth
and
delicious
aftertaste
a
very
solid
beer
and
definitely
worthwhile
to
try
on
tap
if
all
you
have
had
is
the
bottled
version
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
2
finger
white
head
that
leaves
as
soon
as
it
comes
the
aroma
is
grassy
lemony
and
spicey
the
flavor
has
hay
lemon
zest
and
a
spicey
crisp
finish
the
beer
is
light
in
body
well
carbonated
and
easy
drinking
a
very
solid
pilsner
cheers
avoid
i
would
say
this
is
exactly
as
sam
adams
describes
its
just
heavy
enough
to
enjoy
before
spring
while
reminding
you
of
the
crisp
springsummer
beers
to
come
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
seriously
lacking
on
taste
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
rigorous
a
worthy
sampling
but
probably
wont
seek
this
out
again
theres
some
nice
flavors
in
this
beer
and
it
looks
terrific
but
the
somewhat
raw
taste
and
mouthfeel
hurt
its
drinkability
just
a
little
bit
for
me
still
im
glad
to
see
such
a
widely
available
pils
on
the
market
so
i
think
noble
pils
is
a
winner
in
the
end
m
d
it
was
a
bit
dry
for
me
and
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
it
but
over
all
it
was
very
clean
and
smooth
surprising
indeed
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
but
not
watery
well
balanced
hops
and
maltyness
this
has
been
a
throw
back
beer
for
me
i
would
like
a
bit
more
hoppy
character
very
nice
beer
drink
well
done
sam
adams
i
am
hoping
this
will
be
a
year
round
brew
d
oh
yeah
no
problem
puttin
this
back
a
fine
quaffable
example
of
the
style
d
very
very
drinkable
they
should
make
this
a
yearround
offering
id
make
it
my
staple
beer
md
light
bodied
carbonation
is
high
but
the
body
doesnt
fall
apart
drinkability
is
good
very
drinkable
pretty
solid
beer
all
around
overall
color
me
impressed
i
will
reserve
judgment
on
new
sam
adams
products
until
ive
tried
them
from
now
on
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
faded
fast
the
smell
is
inviting
complex
hop
aroma
but
not
super
powerful
some
floral
and
sweet
notes
as
well
taste
starts
mild
with
some
nice
hop
flavor
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
tongue
there
are
some
nice
flavors
happening
from
the
different
hops
the
beer
finishes
crisp
with
a
stronger
bitterness
but
still
very
light
the
next
sip
seems
sweeter
due
to
the
bitter
finish
this
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
not
very
smooth
due
to
the
hops
but
still
enjoyable
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
nice
flavor
worth
checking
out
verdict
noble
pils
is
a
brilliant
little
beer
its
simple
and
easy
drinking
yet
interesting
and
complex
at
the
same
time
as
a
result
its
the
perfect
beer
for
enlightening
those
curious
about
the
world
of
craft
beers
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
american
pilsners
but
this
one
is
now
my
favorite
there
is
a
solid
crisp
maltiness
on
par
with
german
pils
that
i
have
tried
and
a
hop
presence
that
is
assertive
enough
to
make
an
impression
on
taste
and
smell
slight
grainy
sweetness
in
the
front
with
a
finish
that
is
satisfyingly
dry
with
a
hint
of
a
carbonation
bite
the
most
disappointing
part
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
seasonal
this
poured
a
clear
light
gold
with
some
white
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
bready
yeast
and
some
grassy
and
lemon
hops
it
tasted
like
crisp
lemon
and
grassy
hops
with
some
sweet
bready
yeast
and
a
bit
of
light
barley
malt
it
was
slightly
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
clean
and
refreshing
beer
which
was
perfect
for
spring
or
summer
and
was
quite
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
and
body
seemed
fitting
for
the
style
but
werent
anything
too
exciting
good
beer
but
probably
not
one
ill
come
back
to
the
brew
has
a
virtually
clear
yellow
color
with
a
moderate
foamy
head
the
smell
has
a
light
citrus
aroma
nothing
spectacular
the
taste
continued
the
faint
citrus
flavor
and
feels
very
refreshing
and
light
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
to
enjoy
while
relaxing
on
the
patio
pretty
impressive
i
am
a
bit
burnt
out
of
heavy
beers
lately
and
this
really
hit
the
spot
not
the
best
of
its
style
but
it
really
ranks
up
there
reminds
of
a
hoppier
sn
summerfest
i
would
buy
this
again
i
find
this
very
drinkable
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
carbonated
for
what
i
would
want
it
prevents
some
enjoyment
of
the
flavor
bye
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
not
as
good
as
the
bottle
paired
well
with
deep
dish
pizza
d
here
comes
spring
delicious
and
flavorful
but
light
and
easy
drinking
the
hop
flavors
are
dominant
but
the
bitterness
is
not
overwhelming
which
makes
this
a
classic
pils
and
definitely
a
session
beer
clear
golden
body
with
white
powdery
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
a
bold
aroma
of
fresh
hops
dry
greens
and
some
mint
refreshing
taste
of
fresh
hops
grass
dry
greens
smooth
mint
floral
notes
evergreens
slight
alcohol
and
some
graincereal
light
in
body
with
zesty
carbonation
if
i
were
lost
in
the
desert
for
30
days
and
found
my
way
to
a
bar
in
the
oasis
i
wouldnt
look
for
water
i
would
ask
for
this
beer
so
refreshing
that
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
you
see
dwayne
wade
in
these
commercials
soon
d
this
beer
is
crisp
fresh
and
lagered
with
a
great
depth
to
the
hops
yet
still
being
very
drinkable
there
were
no
sulfury
flavors
and
it
wasnt
thin
and
watery
in
any
way
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
when
summer
hits
note
to
self
was
ranked
the
4
german
pilsener
when
i
tasted
it
the
noble
pils
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
quick
dissolving
white
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
semidirty
glass
aromas
are
subtle
but
nice
hints
of
malts
and
hops
some
bready
dough
aromas
also
pop
through
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
it
not
being
overpowering
in
any
regard
but
a
nice
hop
presence
and
a
uniqueness
to
the
palate
pretty
good
tasting
brew
and
definitely
sessionable
as
is
all
sam
adams
brew
overall
a
nice
addition
to
the
sam
adams
lineup
and
will
look
to
this
beer
during
the
warmer
weather
ahead
of
us
drink
i
have
bought
this
a
couple
of
times
it
definetly
beats
any
german
pils
ive
had
taste
is
very
refreshing
and
interesting
coming
from
the
cradle
of
awesome
americanbrewed
german
pilsners
its
difficult
to
get
my
approval
i
still
probably
prefer
the
locallybrewed
versions
but
this
one
slots
in
just
below
worth
a
try
and
a
buy
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
had
some
doubts
about
releasing
a
pils
as
a
spring
seasonal
but
this
certainly
has
its
place
among
the
traditional
spring
styles
especially
blonde
and
maibocks
this
would
be
the
perfect
compliment
to
a
warm
spring
grilling
session
as
it
would
compliment
some
spicy
barbeque
quite
nicely
this
also
would
be
a
fantastic
summer
beer
as
well
love
the
noble
hoppiness
pours
a
very
clear
straw
yellow
to
gold
in
to
my
erdinger
weibbier
glass
hey
it
was
the
only
glass
clean
lol
small
1
finger
head
some
minimal
sticky
lace
very
nicely
carbonated
full
of
bubbles
looks
very
refreshing
smell
is
grassy
kind
of
lightly
piney
some
feint
malt
n
there
taste
is
very
nice
crisp
hop
pine
with
some
white
toast
and
grass
sweet
light
malt
followed
my
a
very
nice
mellow
hop
bitter
feels
soft
and
clean
on
the
tongue
very
nice
amazing
session
beer
im
glad
i
bought
a
whole
6
pack
probably
sam
adams
most
solid
beer
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
most
german
pils
but
thats
the
way
we
like
it
a
great
example
of
how
you
can
make
a
beer
light
but
still
classy
cheers
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
pilsener
beer
to
have
on
hand
after
an
afternoon
of
yard
work
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
another
sixer
just
seems
to
be
missing
that
x
factor
very
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
nice
springtime
quencher
with
some
delicate
and
refreshing
hop
flavors
pours
a
nice
golden
with
a
delicate
very
finely
beaded
pure
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
in
my
pilsner
glass
smells
very
much
of
the
noble
hops
crisp
grassy
herbal
and
a
bit
earthy
with
noticeable
bitterness
even
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
and
with
the
same
hop
notes
as
well
as
a
smidgen
of
citrus
refreshing
and
perhaps
a
tad
softer
than
most
german
style
pils
but
with
a
more
bitter
hop
profile
than
in
a
czech
style
pils
whatever
its
quite
quaffable
and
pleasant
great
effort
by
sam
adams
poured
from
12oz
bottle
to
pint
glass
golden
straw
color
with
creamy
white
2
finger
head
appropriate
lacing
throughout
smells
of
floral
hops
slight
citrus
and
spice
taste
is
the
same
with
malt
to
balance
this
beer
is
thin
to
medium
in
body
and
very
drinkable
i
think
of
spring
noble
pils
is
thinbodied
and
has
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
which
is
appropriate
to
style
a
very
nice
beer
especially
at
its
price
point
and
availability
a
vast
improvement
over
the
white
ale
and
i
will
look
forward
to
picking
this
up
next
season
as
well
as
enjoying
it
for
the
rest
of
this
one
light
to
medium
carbonation
with
a
thin
body
just
enough
to
support
the
flavor
definitely
a
highly
drinkable
seasonal
that
is
both
thirst
quenching
and
flavorful
much
like
the
bottle
says
this
beer
is
quite
lively
its
rather
hoppy
for
a
pilsener
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
some
might
be
turned
away
by
this
but
i
think
that
its
pretty
accessable
its
balanced
extremely
well
there
is
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
but
not
too
much
my
review
was
done
for
the
bottled
beer
but
i
have
also
had
it
on
tap
making
it
even
better
d
highly
drinkable
another
notch
in
the
belt
of
bbc
for
a
wellcrafted
and
widely
distributed
craft
beer
exceedingly
sessionable
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
this
one
is
absolutely
refreshing
great
warm
weather
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
light
bodied
with
a
light
buoyant
carbonation
thats
just
a
bit
creamy
finish
is
a
bit
longer
than
expected
nicely
drinkable
served
from
a
bottle
into
an
8
ounce
glass
im
on
vacation
you
gotta
do
what
you
gotta
do
pours
a
beautiful
clear
gold
with
a
2
finger
white
head
initial
smell
is
of
well
hops
tastes
very
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
but
goes
down
to
smooth
im
on
my
4th
one
of
the
day
right
now
and
i
could
go
for
4
more
probably
my
second
favorite
pilsner
behind
prima
pils
of
course
d
very
drinkable
but
if
you
can
find
it
ontap
youre
twiceblessed
d
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
clean
though
a
little
boring
and
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
does
something
that
a
lot
of
other
pils
dont
its
good
enough
to
get
it
again
bright
grassy
with
notes
of
fresh
baked
baguette
this
is
good
enough
to
merit
a
side
by
side
with
prima
pils
stoudts
and
my
other
favorites
i
look
forward
to
this
day
d
very
easy
to
drink
can
knock
a
few
back
easily
great
pils
sam
adams
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
and
made
a
great
move
by
making
noble
pils
the
new
seasonal
overall
the
taste
is
what
drives
this
beer
sam
adams
takes
the
time
to
pay
attention
to
detail
in
their
beers
but
this
one
seemed
to
be
all
about
the
flavor
once
again
not
a
bad
thing
just
left
a
little
to
be
desired
in
the
look
smell
and
feel
departments
at
5
2
however
along
with
an
excellent
taste
noble
pils
makes
a
fantastic
session
beer
cheers
d
definitely
quaffable
and
i
could
see
wandering
or
stumbling
back
to
the
fridge
for
several
cheers
d
a
solid
pils
not
mindblowing
but
a
good
beer
this
is
my
first
good
pilsner
and
is
close
to
what
i
expected
although
more
hoppy
than
i
thought
it
would
be
im
going
to
pick
up
singles
of
prima
pils
mamas
little
yella
pils
and
compare
with
the
other
bottle
of
this
i
have
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
a
few
weeks
ago
and
was
waiting
for
my
last
one
to
write
the
review
so
i
could
really
give
it
my
best
go
at
it
the
first
4
were
very
good
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
and
as
i
consumed
these
i
was
like
hey
this
is
pretty
good
but
im
not
ready
for
it
yet
as
i
cracked
open
another
southern
tier
choklat
but
today
it
reached
a
whopping
55
degrees
and
i
fired
up
the
grill
and
cracked
my
last
2
noble
pils
wow
the
mood
and
conditions
really
got
me
amped
as
i
knocked
back
my
last
2
of
these
really
smooth
great
color
great
smell
not
too
heavy
extremely
drinkable
and
as
it
warmed
it
still
tasted
pretty
bad
ass
lovin
it
samuel
adams
succeeded
in
their
quest
for
a
quality
spring
beer
enjoying
two
of
these
makes
for
an
excellent
afternoon
i
thought
the
combination
of
all
the
noble
hops
would
be
gimmicky
and
not
all
that
great
however
its
wonderfully
done
a
fore
sure
rebuy
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
i
have
not
had
a
wide
variety
of
pilseners
but
from
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
them
was
a
little
different
than
what
i
got
here
for
me
this
beer
had
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
and
great
drinkability
another
good
entry
from
sammy
out
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
the
pils
appears
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
about
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
are
of
fruits
such
as
white
grapes
lightly
toasted
bread
grains
sweet
biscuits
earthy
grassy
hops
very
clean
and
fresh
tasting
medium
bodied
for
a
pils
and
amply
carbonated
as
well
a
nice
attempt
one
ill
pick
up
again
as
the
weather
breaks
great
job
guys
at
sam
adams
looking
forward
to
many
more
great
brews
you
could
drink
these
all
day
and
not
get
tired
of
them
an
overall
solid
brew
from
sa
not
as
good
as
the
boston
lager
but
still
a
good
beer
also
very
sessionable
enjoy
very
very
drinkable
one
only
is
difficult
buy
these
buy
in
bulk
12oz
bottle
into
a
boston
lager
glass
pours
a
crisp
bubbly
straw
light
orange
with
a
decent
eggshell
head
aroma
is
crisp
earthy
hops
with
a
nice
sweet
malts
profile
right
behind
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
floral
hops
and
sweet
biscuity
malts
with
a
nice
lingering
hop
finish
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
lager
for
a
warm
night
this
beer
is
quite
nice
i
hope
it
sticks
around
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sam
adams
franchise
but
i
really
like
this
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
im
not
much
of
a
pilsner
guy
but
am
about
to
brew
one
and
have
been
boning
up
on
the
better
ones
out
there
on
the
market
i
think
this
qualifies
a
clean
crisp
and
flavorful
pilsner
drinkability
i
liked
it
d
the
drinkability
is
there
id
prefer
this
in
the
summer
over
a
summer
ale
a
solid
pilsener
from
the
company
weve
come
to
expect
everything
from
d
i
was
wondering
why
people
made
such
a
big
deal
about
this
brew
but
i
get
it
now
its
not
overhopped
or
overdone
its
balanced
clean
and
tasty
good
stuff
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
gold
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
on
top
great
retention
leaves
some
sticky
lace
scents
of
corn
honey
grains
straw
and
fresh
bread
great
crisp
body
perfect
for
the
style
slight
oily
feel
on
the
backend
sharp
grains
at
the
first
sip
mild
hop
bitterness
light
sour
note
in
the
middle
finish
is
mild
and
bready
this
is
a
great
beer
one
that
i
will
visit
again
and
again
once
the
weather
warms
for
sure
warm
straw
colored
some
white
lace
honeyish
pils
malt
and
grassy
hops
in
the
aroma
opens
up
with
soft
pils
malt
good
honey
notes
and
doughy
hints
earthy
spicy
hops
keep
the
mouthfeel
clean
slightly
minerally
hops
sweep
through
the
finish
leaving
green
earthy
flavors
has
that
sam
adams
round
quality
to
the
mouthfeel
and
body
which
is
slightly
fuller
than
a
typical
german
pils
but
i
dont
mind
it
a
very
tasty
pils
mdmouth
is
a
nice
medium
body
and
an
extremly
complex
pils
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
dont
let
the
many
hops
scare
u
away
from
this
one
its
very
approachable
pours
yellow
with
a
few
hints
of
orange
a
rush
of
bubbles
result
in
a
midsized
white
head
that
stays
around
for
quite
a
while
as
the
bubble
activity
goes
on
and
on
eventually
things
settle
down
slightly
and
i
take
a
whiff
and
get
a
some
notes
of
straw
some
floral
activity
and
a
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
perfectly
crisp
and
malty
with
a
good
hop
bite
in
the
middle
and
a
slight
yeasty
funk
at
the
end
lightbodied
and
smooth
like
a
good
pils
should
be
but
without
n
sacrificing
of
taste
best
pils
ive
had
in
a
while
spring
is
almost
upon
us
and
i
can
see
sessioning
a
lot
of
these
in
the
near
future
perhaps
if
sa
used
just
one
of
the
five
varieties
of
noble
hops
the
hop
nosetaste
could
have
been
more
focused
it
seems
like
they
are
running
against
each
other
and
none
are
making
headway
i
would
not
want
to
try
this
again
it
did
not
refresh
me
and
the
feel
was
off
for
a
pils
its
drinkable
but
not
memorable
its
clean
refreshing
and
drinkable
well
crafted
just
a
bit
boring
by
nature
i
just
dont
find
this
style
all
that
interesting
d
could
drink
these
all
night
i
am
impressed
with
this
version
from
sam
adams
it
pour
a
nice
golden
color
aroma
of
all
those
great
hops
a
bit
grassy
nice
bread
taste
with
a
citrus
bite
to
it
it
is
hard
to
not
want
to
keep
drinking
these
a
great
thirst
quencher
and
session
beer
definitely
try
to
enjoy
these
while
it
is
still
around
the
drinkability
is
insane
i
can
attest
to
that
opinion
i
am
actually
impressed
with
this
beer
it
really
has
the
aspects
of
a
northern
german
pilsner
and
the
malt
bill
is
reserved
enough
to
let
the
hops
shine
through
but
substantial
enough
that
it
gives
your
palate
something
to
chew
on
for
a
good
while
after
the
sip
even
pilsners
that
are
this
hoppy
arent
something
that
i
regularly
enjoy
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
and
in
fact
i
think
that
it
is
probably
one
of
samis
best
buy
again
if
in
the
mood
for
a
pilsener
this
might
be
the
one
bleached
white
head
of
openly
knit
foam
forms
hills
and
vales
before
finally
dissolving
across
the
surface
smattering
of
lacing
left
behind
bright
metallic
orange
in
color
mostly
transparent
few
loose
bubbles
visible
clean
nose
of
pretzel
dough
peppery
spice
dried
orange
rinds
and
apricot
and
peach
pits
very
light
corn
element
vague
molasses
as
it
warms
nothing
pushy
about
it
at
all
however
displays
good
staying
power
the
same
lightbodied
with
active
carbonation
the
orange
to
lemon
citrus
shows
bite
through
the
attack
and
matches
the
sourdough
multigrain
bread
flavors
nicely
just
a
smattering
of
pine
resin
the
hops
arent
too
aggressive
honey
and
a
generalized
malty
softness
cushion
the
ending
without
impairing
overall
freshness
excellent
drinkability
well
mr
koch
is
right
this
beer
reminds
me
that
spring
is
just
around
the
corner
from
the
brightly
colored
green
and
blue
labeling
on
the
bottle
to
the
light
clean
look
to
the
grassy
hop
character
of
the
flavor
this
beer
has
spring
written
all
over
it
not
my
favorite
pilsener
but
its
up
there
very
drinkable
very
goodlooking
and
pretty
tasty
pick
this
up
and
give
it
a
try
d
really
easydrinking
and
refreshing
pils
a
nice
surprise
coming
from
sam
adams
overall
personally
i
prefer
malts
over
hops
but
i
did
enjoy
this
almost
reminded
me
of
a
sierra
nevada
on
tap
not
bad
for
an
american
version
of
a
german
classic
if
you
really
love
hops
skip
this
and
get
the
victory
pils
but
all
in
all
another
good
product
from
jim
cook
very
drinkable
with
a
reasonable
abv
love
this
beer
light
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
would
be
nice
in
the
summertime
this
is
a
great
pilsner
it
manages
to
pack
in
flavor
and
be
interesting
while
also
remaining
extremely
light
and
drinkable
well
done
sammy
a
d
im
an
ale
guy
but
this
pilsner
really
stood
out
to
me
and
i
like
it
a
lot
this
is
a
brew
that
i
can
sit
back
and
partake
of
many
times
over
because
it
can
double
as
a
session
beer
and
a
specialty
beer
depending
on
the
mood
good
job
boston
brewery
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
not
much
of
a
body
drinkability
is
good
i
like
this
hoppy
lager
style
and
could
put
a
couple
of
these
down
ok
ill
bite
people
have
been
raving
over
this
brew
since
it
came
out
saying
its
one
of
bbcs
best
so
ill
give
it
a
shot
pours
crystal
clear
and
golden
half
inch
white
head
no
lacing
in
the
sa
glass
aroma
is
a
little
muted
for
such
a
hoppy
brew
aromas
of
bread
lightly
toasted
malt
grassy
herbal
and
light
orange
flavor
follows
suit
its
not
bitter
by
any
means
but
it
has
nice
hop
flavor
without
being
overdone
well
balanced
against
the
pale
malts
but
a
bone
dry
finish
not
bad
stuff
very
easy
drinking
but
nothing
to
crazy
over
i
can
dig
this
brew
but
for
an
everyday
drinker
ill
still
go
for
something
cheaper
na
zdravje
lightmedium
body
decent
carbonation
very
drinkable
should
be
a
very
nice
warm
weather
brew
but
worthwhile
anytime
another
decent
brew
from
samuel
adams
overall
this
brew
was
ok
im
prolly
never
gonna
buy
a
6
in
my
life
again
but
oh
well
dont
true
pilsners
have
saaz
hops
and
not
the
tattenuag
or
whatever
sammy
throws
in
almost
all
of
their
beers
this
might
be
a
good
brew
for
someone
who
can
get
a
hint
of
the
whole
hop
aspect
very
nice
version
of
a
german
pilsner
much
fresher
than
most
imported
versions
has
a
nice
straw
color
head
dissipates
quickly
nose
has
a
nice
hop
aroma
less
aggressive
and
dare
i
say
noble
than
your
standard
ipa
nicely
crisp
bitter
and
dry
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
liked
that
there
was
none
of
that
stale
skunk
you
get
in
many
imports
for
my
tastes
it
fell
just
short
of
the
lagunitas
pils
in
quality
one
of
the
more
interesting
pilsners
ive
had
it
provides
enough
of
what
youd
expect
from
an
sa
beer
but
still
resounds
of
a
true
pilsner
i
wasnt
sure
what
id
think
of
this
one
i
will
miss
sam
adams
white
and
pilsners
arent
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
with
a
pure
white
head
light
smell
of
hops
the
taste
was
not
at
all
what
i
expected
somewhat
hoppy
yet
the
malt
is
still
there
a
bit
sharp
on
carbonation
but
not
overly
ill
get
it
again
drinkability
i
was
a
bit
worried
when
i
heard
sam
adams
a
popular
brand
was
releasing
a
pilsner
as
their
seasonal
ive
had
too
many
average
pilsners
and
i
thought
theyd
for
sure
dumb
this
beer
down
a
bit
however
they
diddnt
sam
adams
brewed
an
awesome
german
pils
a
clean
hoppy
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
delicious
easy
to
drink
and
a
real
contender
for
my
other
favorite
american
made
german
pils
victory
prima
pils
i
think
theyre
pretty
equal
though
victory
has
more
of
a
lemon
taste
to
it
and
the
visual
edge
i
still
forsee
this
beer
beign
a
regular
in
my
ridge
come
warmer
weather
kudos
to
sam
adams
for
adding
this
to
the
seasonal
line
up
a
beer
company
not
afraid
to
add
to
change
things
now
and
then
i
wont
miss
the
old
white
pilsners
tend
to
be
my
least
favorite
style
simply
because
of
usual
players
there
this
is
a
stand
out
though
ritht
ther
with
victorus
prima
pils
good
across
the
board
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
it
every
spring
dim
not
the
biggest
pilsner
fan
i
dont
pick
them
up
a
lot
i
bought
this
cause
im
a
sam
adams
fan
though
very
drinkable
i
think
i
would
like
it
a
little
colder
than
i
normally
drink
beer
at
im
upset
the
that
white
ale
is
gone
in
favour
of
this
though
pure
win
from
sam
adams
i
just
wish
the
local
distributor
would
but
out
the
bottles
of
this
beer
already
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
goes
down
well
it
has
a
medium
body
and
is
slightly
crisp
as
well
purchase
at
the
post
exchange
in
south
korea
a
good
value
on
this
unexpected
pleasure
golden
clear
not
cloudy
in
the
least
and
pours
a
decent
one
inch
head
that
dissipated
quickly
somewhat
hoppy
and
fruity
definitely
more
flavour
than
most
pils
that
i
am
accustomed
to
nice
bouquet
almost
reminds
me
of
a
good
heiffe
mouth
feel
is
good
somewhat
effervescent
matched
it
with
some
nice
mild
cheeses
drinkability
is
good
would
not
have
a
problem
knocking
back
a
couple
more
on
an
occasion
the
palate
opens
with
a
big
noble
hop
flavor
citrus
and
herbs
pine
and
flowers
dry
crackery
and
spicy
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
jever
with
its
firm
and
bitter
mouthfeel
the
finish
has
an
earthy
resiny
peppery
quality
to
it
with
a
long
lingering
bitterness
malt
is
kept
in
check
throughout
this
is
quite
dry
and
only
reveals
a
hint
of
pilsner
malt
in
the
midpalate
very
good
stuff
ill
be
drinking
this
again
while
its
around
drinkability
i
could
put
back
a
six
pack
of
these
by
myself
great
session
beer
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
when
i
get
the
spring
pack
of
sa
it
pours
a
bright
clear
yellow
with
a
decent
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
it
has
a
fresh
grassy
hop
smell
mixed
with
some
light
grainysweet
malt
notes
the
taste
is
a
bright
grassy
very
lightly
citrus
hop
flavor
back
by
some
sweet
grain
malt
notes
while
very
nice
the
hopiness
is
a
bit
less
present
than
what
i
was
expecting
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
enjoyable
although
it
could
do
with
a
bit
less
carbonation
despite
the
lack
of
hop
presence
it
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
although
i
think
it
would
be
better
suited
as
a
late
spring
even
early
summer
seasonal
drinkability
very
drinkable
the
combination
of
hops
is
complementary
and
they

the

some

with
a
fairly
dry

balanced

and
complex

that

very
drinkable
like
most
other
pilseners
i
wish
i
had
a
hot
dog
drinkability
dry
and
refreshing
makes
drinkability
very
good
nothing
extraordinary
about
the
flavor
but
still
good
because
of
my
limited
experience
with
beer
most
macros
tend
to
make
me
sick
especially
those
in
an
aluminum
can
it
is
hard
for
me
to
properly
review
a
beer
the
smell
is
typical
of
most
for
me
because
i
havent
been
trained
to
pick
up
the
nuances
from
style
to
style
the
taste
for
me
was
very
good
much
more
drinkable
than
a
standard
lager
it
is
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
also
a
damn
fine
pilsner
a
solid
effort
on
sam
adams
part
and
a
great
contribution
to
the
beer
world
as
a
whole
drinkability
great
mix
of
a
traditional
pilsner
and
a
pale
ale
it
is
light
and
dry
with
solid
carbonation
while
providing
a
beer
that
keeps
you
interested
through
the
use
of
hops
wonderful
overall
1
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
in
awhile
all
in
all
this
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
pilsner
scene
but
it
feels
a
little
too
overproduced
to
knock
out
the
top
of
the
style
still
a
wellcrafted
hoppy
pilsner
the
nose
is
gorgeous
with
a
bright
herbal
lemon
zest
delicate
grainy
malt
character
and
some
earth
the
palate
opens
with
a
big
noble
hop
character
lots
of
earthy
hop
flavor
some
lemon
and
just
a
bit
of
mint
delicate
and
quite
nuanced
with
some
grainy
malt
character
this
beer
finishes
dry
crisp
and
with
a
lingering
german
hop
bitterness
clean
as
hell
theres
no
offflavors
in
this
one
this
lightbodied
beer
is
a
pleasure
on
the
palate
and
eminently
drinkable
quite
possibly
the
best
sam
adams
beer
there
is
after
utopias
that
is
it
does
not
transport
you
back
to
the
old
country
but
it
transports
you
to
the
new
county
the
eu
today
maybe
i
think
they
wish
they
made
beer
this
good
in
the
eu
d
even
though
pilsener
has
not
been
one
of
my
favorite
styles
for
a
long
time
this
one
proved
to
be
a
big
surprise
it
is
on
tap
at
a
neighborhood
spot
and
i
think
ill
be
ordering
it
again
very
drinkable
showed
me
sam
adams
is
still
a
big
player
in
the
american
craft
brewing
game
had
from
a
bottle
and
tap
d
good
i
could
have
several
of
these
4
0
d
easily
drinkable
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
this
but
could
see
how
it
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
for
some
light
bodied
smooth
nice
carbonation
well
worth
trying
on
tap
and
worth
having
again
sometime
d
great
drinkability
very
crisp
and
refreshing
d
i
usually
shy
away
from
pilseners
i
think
because
i
think
they
are
boring
i
am
not
sure
but
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
up
i
was
just
wanting
some
spring
on
this
very
wetsnowyslushy
day
what
i
got
was
a
reminder
of
how
good
sam
can
be
and
a
a
door
opened
into
the
rarely
travelled
world
of
craft
pilseners
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
giant
white
frothy
head
the
head
lasts
and
leaves
great
lacing
the
smell
is
very
strong
with
floral
hintswheat
and
some
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
with
hopswheatand
bread
yeast
the
mf
is
light
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
this
is
on
my
short
list
of
new
favorite
summer
beer
cheers
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
a
good
but
of
lacing
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
pretty
complex
the
most
i
get
is
grassy
notes
from
the
hops
and
a
little
malt
the
taste
is
hoppy
upfront
but
supported
very
nicely
by
malt
very
crisp
and
clean
pretty
light
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
though
i
miss
the
previous
spring
seasonal
white
ale
i
was
impressed
overall
a
very
solid
pilsner
i
feel
the
art
of
a
solid
crafted
pilsner
by
commercial
brewers
is
hard
to
come
by
but
the
boston
brewing
company
has
done
it
here
even
drinking
this
in
the
winter
while
it
snows
outside
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
on
a
warm
spring
day
this
is
a
good
beer
for
sessioning
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
character
but
it
isnt
overwhelming
d
all
in
all
an
incredibly
well
executed
pilsner
a
great
beer
for
being
outside
on
a
sunny
day
this
is
a
terrific
german
pilsener
and
i
will
most
definitely
be
picking
up
another
sixtel
this
summer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
the
vienna
malt
finish
and
the
slight
bit
of
breadiness
and
hop
zing
fairly
bitter
due
to
the
hops
as
well
close
to
a
pale
ale
in
terms
of
bitterness
very
solid
beer
from
a
solid
lineup
not
a
bad
beer
here
at
all
golden
straw
color
with
bone
white
head
smell
is
largely
some
pilsner
malt
though
a
significant
amount
of
cat
pee
subsisted
as
well
taste
is
a
bit
better
with
some
of
the
light
malts
paired
with
some
citrus
mf
is
a
bit
small
though
not
a
dealbreaker
drinkability
is
good
and
only
limited
by
the
fact
that
i
refused
to
remove
myself
a
good
representation
for
american
brewer
for
what
its
worth
cheers
when
poured
from
the
bottle
the
foam
was
pretty
much
white
in
color
thick
and
stuck
to
the
glass
till
the
end
the
color
was
light
blonde
yellow
with
gold
highlights
the
smell
was
very
hoppycomplex
in
nature
and
almost
fruity
the
taste
was
of
a
typical
american
pils
light
taste
with
a
small
overtone
of
flowers
mouthfeel
medium
to
light
bodied
drinkability
not
too
bad
but
for
some
reason
i
expected
this
to
have
more
of
a
robust
and
complex
hops
taste
based
on
what
i
saw
in
the
sam
adams
commercial
m
d
refreshing
crisp
very
drinkable
a
nice
food
accompaniment
if
paired
appropriately
great
offering
from
samuel
adams
just
a
wonderful
tasting
refreshing
sessionable
pilsner
this
is
a
difficult
beer
for
me
to
review
i
found
it
to
be
very
pleasant
but
at
the
same
time
it
wasnt
enough
for
me
the
look
is
golden
very
clear
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
citrus
it
starts
sweet
and
becomes
citrusy
sour
carbonation
comes
in
and
finishes
sour
and
bitter
together
i
had
this
beer
with
my
girlfriend
a
fan
of
dark
beers
she
stated
it
was
what
you
wish
american
lagers
were
like
however
was
to
light
for
both
of
us
overall
impression
pilsner
is
not
a
style
i
drink
often
but
this
is
certainly
one
i
would
drink
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
starter
beer
for
newbeez
pours
a
strongly
yellow
straw
with
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
some
nice
but
average
tough
to
explain
its
a
mental
thing
i
guess
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
heavy
on
the
hops
citrus
and
pine
notes
and
adds
a
bit
of
florality
as
well
as
could
be
gleaned
from
the
nose
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
hoppy
bitterness
with
a
biting
bit
of
citrus
and
not
much
maltiness
to
speak
of
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
moderate
and
has
some
decent
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
especially
if
youre
into
the
whole
hop
scene
and
whatnot
d
this
is
very
decent
but
it
quickly
has
diminishing
returns
very
drinkable
i
killed
the
whole
bomber
in
no
time
really
a
great
pils
overall
almost
prima
pils
level
an
enjoyable
new
offering
from
sa
not
my
favorite
but
good
enough
for
this
to
be
the
3rd
12pack
ive
picked
up
this
month
unfortunately
a
couple
of
bottles
have
had
a
slightly
skunked
taste
so
make
sure
you
get
a
fresh
one
very
drinkable
as
i
love
just
about
everything
sabosotn
beer
brings
to
the
table
cheers
overall
this
is
a
great
great
brew
from
the
boys
in
boston
i
would
recommend
it
wow
i
just
cant
get
past
the
horrible
longlasting
aftertaste
even
my
wife
who
only
drinks
pilsners
had
a
hard
time
even
finishing
one
looking
forward
to
fall
so
i
can
try
another
seasonal
brew
from
samuel
adams
this
spring
selection
misses
the
mark
imo
taste
is
clean
crisp
refreshing
and
citrus
hoppiness
really
comes
through
it
lacks
the
complexity
as
a
lot
of
the
sa
brews
have
as
a
norm
and
i
think
that
is
what
people
kinda
expect
but
its
a
pilsner
people
its
just
that
sa
does
it
w
more
flare
and
flavor
sa
knows
hops
and
i
think
they
did
this
pilsner
right
the
mouthfeel
is
a
mildmoderate
carbonation
and
very
refreshing
its
like
any
of
the
common
light
beers
out
there
macros
but
on
steroids
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
to
see
those
who
are
married
to
bl
cl
to
really
enjoy
this
one
from
sa
well
done
sa
another
great
beer
over
all
sam
adams
comes
through
again
i
finished
the
beer
with
foam
settling
down
on
the
bottom
of
glass
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
light
enough
for
hot
summer
day
im
happy
that
this
is
the
spring
beer
this
year
i
was
disappointed
with
white
ale
taste
is
quite
clean
and
refreshing
with
lemon
spices
and
the
hops
not
bitter
like
a
pale
ale
very
clean
not
as
grainy
as
many
pilsener
attempts
i
have
had
good
carbonation
and
very
nice
to
drink
a
refreshing
addition
to
the
pilsener
list
for
me
possibly
the
best
one
i
have
had
easy
to
drink
and
nice
moutfeel
bright
and
crisp
extremely
drinkable
ideal
for
warmer
weather
better
than
any
euro
pils
ive
had
stacks
up
to
the
better
helles
out
there
even
victory
prima
pils
d
a
damn
fine
pilsner
lots
of
hops
with
a
subtle
malt
sweetness
in
the
background
the
flavor
doesnt
destroy
the
palate
this
makes
the
drinkability
exceptional
too
bad
this
is
only
a
spring
seasonal
it
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
boston
beer
co
since
the
homebrewers
traditional
bock
from
last
year
keep
it
up
drinkability
very
easy
to
quaff
though
on
an
empty
stomach
3
pints
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
left
me
feeling
good
excellent
in
the
bottle
better
on
tap
a
most
welcome
addition
to
the
local
draught
beer
scene
d
goes
down
very
easy
something
for
the
bmc
crowd
but
complex
enough
for
bas
this
is
an
excellent
beer
makes
me
think
of
summer
i
hope
they
brew
this
through
at
least
late
spring
it
seems
a
little
out
of
place
when
it
is
35
degrees
outside
highly
recommended

the
part

the
first
in
quite
some
time
ive
been
impressed

like
it

special

this
pilnser
was
a
brilliant
gold
with
a
short
white
head
that
left
lacing
while
this
is
a
pretty
hoppy
pils
sa
still
left
a
biscuity
bread
undercurrent
of
malt
the
hop
meanwhile
provided
a
big
grassy
lemon
character
that
was
both
clean
satisfying
and
refreshing
its
hard
to
find
a
wellmade
highibu
pilsner
this
is
easily
one
of
sams
best
brews
this
is
one
killer
pilsner
it
takes
a
good
deal
of
skill
to
brew
a
beer
so
cleantasting

flavorful

so
many

seem
to
fail

this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
one
of
the
best
pilsners
that
ive
sampled
a
highly
enjoyable
quaff
i
could
drink
these
all
night
what
a
good
session
beer
i
wish
this
was
a
yearround
offering
i
can
see
this
brew
as
a
fine
companion
while
tending
the
grill
on
a
warm
evening
d
a
delicious
and
decidedly
laidback
take
on
a
style
dominated
by
much
hoppier
beers
while
i
would
wish
for
a
touch
more
bittering
the
light
flavor
and
bright
character
of
this
beer
will
no
doubt
woo
many
macro
drinkers
who
are
ready
to
try
another
beer
that
looks
much
like
the
ones
theyre
used
to
but
with
heaps
more
flavor
one
of
the
best
bridge
beers
ive
found
yet
overall
this
was
a
solid
pilsner
however
its
hoppier
than
the
more
traditional
versions
worth
a
shot
clear
golden
cast
with
a
nice
fizzy
head
of
eggshell
that
leaves
scraps
of
fine
lace
on
the
glass
fresh
smelling
noble
hops
and
untoasted
grain
make
up
the
nose
on
this
one
grassy
citric
noble
hops
and
notes
of
hay
and
heather
honey
this
must
be
what
a
fresh
german
pils
tastes
like
nice
medium
bodied
with
bright
and
lively
carbonation
a
nice
beer
and
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
bbc
has
a
lightpale
golden
color
more
head
than
i
expected
nothing
too
special
about
the
smell
you
can
get
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
overall
it
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
hoppy
it
reminds
me
of
a
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
outside
in
nice
weather
and
not
inside
a
bar
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
and
clear
amber
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
with
a
slight
head
and
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
of
citrusy
hops
mostly
lemony
and
you
can
smell
the
lager
yeast
as
well
the
taste
has
the
definate
characteristics
of
a
nice
lager
as
well
as
some
orange
peel
flavors
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
balance
with
a
good
carbonation
level
i
highly
drinkable
brew
well
done
samuel
as
an
avid
fan
of
all
things
cascade
hops
it
is
nice
every
once
in
a
while
to
step
back
and
remember
that
yes
there
are
other
hops
out
there
that
dont
strip
the
enamel
off

nothing

fairly

oily
for
the
style
the
light
scent
and
flavor
is
offset
by
these
bolder
qualities
overall
a
nice
hoppy
yet
lighter
beer
that
has
popped
up
in
some
very
non
craft
beer
friendly
locations
which
is
a
good
thing
draught
a
sticky
fingers
this
one
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
mine
had
almost
no
head
on
it
at
all
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
nice
it
smells
like
a
traditional
pils
grassy
and
floral
hops
are
the
main
notes
the
taste
is
quite
good
this
is
somewhat
bitter
with
no
sweetness
at
all
somewhat
spicy
with
a
fair
amount
of
maltiness
a
nice
beer
very
easy
to
drink
d
extremely
drinkable
probably
even
chuggable
d
as
far
as
pilsners
go
the
usmade
versions
at
least
this
ranks
highly
on
the
drinkability
scale
maybe
its
the
deceptively
springlike
february
weather
were
having
that
makes
it
so
but
this
feels
like
the
type
of
light
and
refreshing
satisfyingly
wellcrafted
lager
i
could
drink
all
day
nice
job
bbc
i
will
be
buying
this
again
d
hopefully
this
is
a
yearly
seasonal
not
many
tasty
pilsners
readily
available
in
this
area
very
nice
pour
clear
golden
with
good
carbonation
grassy
aroma
kind
of
faint
bready
taste
hints
of
apple
and
banana
with
some
aftertaste
of
rye
flavor
missing
some
more
hoppiness
but
taste
grows
on
me
with
continued
drinking
clean
feel
very
drinkable
decent
definitely
not
great
beer
pours
more
pale
than
boston
lager
and
sam
light
clear
yellow
smells
were
more
faint
than
expected
but
still
nice
light
floral
and
sweet
aromas
i
do
get
some
honey
on
the
nose
which
is
very
pleasant
yeasty
and
pure
bread
dominates
the
flavor
with
some
other
familiar
pilsner
tastes
barnyard
and
metallic
tinge
good
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
very
drinkable
for
the
category
not
too
shabby
but
no
a
for
me
this
would
be
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
to
go
with
pizza
bar
food
or
the
like
overall
it
is
interesting
and
a
refreshing
take
on
the
pilsner
with
lots
to
enjoy
the
bitterness
throws
the
balance
off
a
bit
but
it
is
well
rounded
and
solid
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
get
when
its
not
sitting
next
to
other
more
enticing
bottles
or
drafts
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
noble
pils
is
a
goldenstraw
color
completely
clear
with
a
huge
frothy
hop
head
that
dies
down
and
leaves
sticky
white
lacing
in
its
path
the
smell
is
a
hop
punch
in
the
nose
a
nice
mix
of
floral
grassy
citrusy
hops
covers
up
whatever
sort
of
malt
backdrop
that
might
be
in
there
the
flavor
does
allow
the
malt
to
come
through
in
a
grainy
nondistinct
fashion
and
the
hops
still
dominate
but
not
in
a
lingering
bitterness
way
i
do
detect
a
slight
metallic
tinge
that
doesnt
bode
well
for
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
body
with
a
slightly
slick
yet
dry
finish
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
winner
by
sa
too
bad
this
one
is
only
a
seasonal
noble
pills
poured
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
small
head
it
had
a
rich
and
hoppy
smell
to
it
as
well
the
taste
was
very
delightfull
and
left
a
very
intresting
but
good
after
taste
its
sad
to
see
the
white
ale
be
replaced
as
a
seasonal
beer
but
this
new
sam
adams
doesnt
disapoint
had
in
a
sample
pack
the
drink
had
a
dark
yellowstraw
color
with
a
cloudy
frothy
head
bready
aromas
mixed
with
grassy
citrus
are
the
general
smells
i
sensed
slight
metallic
taste
with
a
sweet
malt
good
carbonation
and
really
crisp
overall
not
too
bad
at
all
perfectly
golden
and
perfectly
clear
not
much
of
a
head
though
soon
all
ive
got
is
a
bubbly
dirty
white
collar
aroma
is
really
big

its
very
fragrant
even
nuances

balanced

towards
the
hops
which
is
nice
low

with
a
nice

on
the
end
an
easy
drink
best
german
pils
i
can
get
in
my
area
doverall
between
is
great
taste
wonderful
balance
this
beer
is
highly
recommended
and
can
easily
be
drunk
all
night
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
definitely
the
most
creamy
out
of
any
pilsner
ive
ever
had
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
but
nothing
over
the
top
drinkability
is
great
this
is
something
i
could
put
down
all
night
in
about
any
type
of
weather
and
love
every
bit
of
it
all
in
all
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
its
priced
right
and
its
worth
a
shot
not
exactly
your
typical
pils
by
all
means
i
do
suggest
you
come
into
this
one
with
an
open
mind
d
nice
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
vs
late
winter
this
beer
does
fall
a
bit
short
on
the
complexity
and
flavor
vs
the
samuel
adams
hallertau
imperial
pilsner
that
has
been
retired
a
good
beer
overall
though
1224
if
you
havent
had
noble
pils
already
it
is
too
late
the
beer
is
past
its
prime
if
you
cant
find
one
with
a
best
by
date
after
june
refrigerated
or
not
clear
yellow
pour
with
nice
head
and
lacing
huge
hoppy
perfumy
fruity
nose
for
a
pilsner
in
fact
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
it
i
had
to
take
a
huge
sniff
before
every
sip
the
taste
is
much
the
same
amazing
fresh
picked
hops
tang
to
it
albeit
subdued
in
comparison
to
an
ipa
fairly
complex
with
hints
of
lemon
grass
and
metal
present
nice
crisp
refreshing
dry
finish
with
just
a
subtle
hint
of
bitterness
hugely
drinkable
i
usually
prefer
the
extremely
bitter
pilsners
like
bitburger
but
this
was
unique
and
was
almost
closer
to
a
pale
ale
than
a
pils
i
have
to
say
this
beer
has
unseated
victory
prima
pils
as
my
favorite
american
pilsner
this
is
one
top
notch
beer
taste
is
awesome
youd
think
this
is
a
light
beer
but
no
its
a
got
a
great
full
body
and
surprisingly
most
of
the
character
is
from
the
malt
and
the
hops
just
spruce
it
up
very
nice
beer
overall
a
light
and
delicate
beer
but
very
well
done
even
though
its
reserved
pilsener
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
right
up
there
with
victorys
prima
pils
for
the
best
ive
had
these
are
extremely
drinkable
and
i
could
see
myself
easily
putting
back
quite
a
few
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
melange
of
sorts
it
is
quite
sweet
with
a
slightly
cloying
grassiness
herbal
graininess
that
comes
with
the
style
the
piney
but
almost
grassy
and
candied
hop
presence
is
particularly
felt
and
doesnt
entirely
blend
in
with
the
malty
base
of
the
beer
there
is
lots
going
on
in
this
pilsner
but
not
all
of
it
good
it
is
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
some
nice
hop
flavors
emerge
but
the
beer
ventures
into
some
odd
territory
and
the
candied
hops
are
just
a
bit
off
for
my
tastes
the
saltene
dryness
in
the
finish
is
okay
and
brings
the
beer
back
to
its
germanic
roots
the
candied
hop
flavors
are
throwing
this
beer
off
for
me
the
drinkability
is
good
its
a
nice
showcase
for
noble
hops
with
a
lot
of
nice
hop
based
complexities
refreshing
an
well
crafted
a
wonderful
light
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
truly
a
session
beer
i
could
definatly
see
myself
getting
this
again
for
any
occasion
any
time
of
year
it
goes
down
quite
well
go
get
some
and
see
what
all
the
talk
is
about
you
wont
be
dissapointed
the
nose
matched
the
beer
nearly
to
perfection
it
was
a
fantastic
combination
of
a
good
bitter
kick
with
hops
atop
it
and
a
bready
malt
behind
it
very
well
balanced
incredibly
crisp
and
clean
on
the
palate
with
a
bitter
though
not
lingering
finish
strongly
carbonated
in
fact
perhaps
overly
so
as
you
could
feel
in
effervesce
within
your
mouth
good
bitter
flavor
that
the
germans
add
to
these
lagers
as
well
as
great
carbonation
refreshing
flavor
and
and
an
all
around
great
drinker
for
any
time
of
year
this
was
suprisingly
good
i
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
at
the
grocery
store
because
it
was
on
sale
7
49
although
i
havent
bought
sam
in
a
while
the
high
reviews
made
me
curious
nice
malt
big
hop
flavor
and
great
drinkability
means
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
at
a
party
this
might
be
a
good
choice
for
a
st
patricks
day
party
due
to
the
use
of
green
on
the
label
it
would
certainly
beat
the
hell
out
of
killians
i
for
one
liked
the
previous
spring
seasonal
white
ale
from
sa
more
than
the
summerfest
lager
i
am
curious
if
they
will
be
replacing
that
as
well
for
the
price
this
is
a
solid
buy
d
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
there
is
no
shortage
of
extreme
beers
on
the
shelves
it
is
nice
to
see
another
well
crafted
american
session
beer
recommended
lagars
are
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
i
think
this
was
a
very
good
well
made
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
new
brew
from
sam
adams
hands
down
my
new
favorite
variety
that
doesnt
cost
170
per
bottle
d
pretty
damn
impressive
i
must
say
i
can
tell
this
is
crafted
very
well
sits
very
nice
wouldnt
mind
having
another
good
work
lighter
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
one
is
a
drinker
and
went
down
very
very
easy
not
a
complex
or
malty
as
some
german
or
czech
pilseners
but
a
very
decent
brew
by
far
someone
actually
gave
this
one
an
f
how
absolutely
worth
trying
i
had
this
at
the
local
99
a
few
weeks
ago
on
tap
and
it
was
really
good
stands
up
quite
nicely
in
the
bottle
as
well
id
definitely
check
this
one
out
again
very
drinkable
a
good
medium
body
to
it
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
polish
off
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
smooth
drinking
beer
no
harsh
flavors
or
aromas
o
very
good
pilsner
one
of
the
top
few
ive
had
part
of
a
good
ol

of

were
of

smell
was
of
grassy
hops
citrus
lemon
in
particular
and
some
spice
taste
was
clean
and
rich
with
lemon
citrus
straw
and
grassy
hops
tasted
very
authentic
for
the
style
mouthfeel
was
light
crisp
and
clean
very
nice
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
better
id
have
to
say
from
the
boston
beer
co
single
from
total
wine
chantilly
va
boston
beers
new
spring
seasonal
sings
with
five
noble
hop
varieties
pours
clear
and
golden
effervescent
bubbles
smells
like
hops
and
lemon
tastes
dry
grassy
hint
of
pepper
inviting
refreshing
solid
example
of
the
style
a
sunny
spring
day
on
the
lawn
one
of
samuel
adams
very
best
overall
this
is
a
good
pilsner
and
if
it
ever
comes
to
canada
will
probably
see
the
inside
of
my
fridge
for
times
when
i
want
an
approachable
nononsense
pilsner
but
for
most
of
the
rest
of
the
time
ill
probably
stick
with
prima
pils
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
poured
a
brilliant
pale
gold
with
a
finger
of
white
head
pretty
good
amount
of
noble
hops
also
some
citrus
in
the
aroma
not
as
bitter
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
fair
amount
of
malt
light
bodied
nice
fresh
hop
bite
hops
linger
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
great
pilsner
i
am
a
bit
curious
as
to
why
this
is
a
seasonal
instead
of
a
year
rounder
or
i
would
make
it
a
summer
seasonal
though
i
do
know
sa
has
some
of
them
already
excellent
beer
and
a
welcome
addition
to
the
lineup
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
this
would
actually
make
for
a
great
summer
brew
one
that
is
borderline
sessionable
i
would
recommend
at
least
trying
it
if
you
enjoy
a
german
pilsener
poured
into
a
pint
glass
leaves
12
white
head
minimal
lacing
very
clear
deep
gold
color
smell
is
faint
hops
strawgrains
taste
has
loads
of
bittering
hops
very
crisp
and
refreshing
theres
almost
a
floral
quality
to
the
taste
with
an
oak
aftertaste
appropriate
carbonation
for
a
pils
good
bitter
finish
one
could
drink
quite
a
number
of
these
drinkability
a
nice
offering
from
sam
adams
suddenly
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
a
bit
different
than
the
bottled
version
hops
arent
nearly
as
prominent
on
the
nose
but
still
showcase
plenty
of
herbal
grassiness
on
tongue
the
pilsener
malt
base
is
sweet
with
a
toasted
edge
also
theres
just
a
hint
of
diacetyl
on
the
finish
that
i
didnt
detect
in
the
bottle
all
in
all
its
still
a
tasty
draft
pilsener
and
its
availability
is
nice
value
great
deal
for
around
8
00
a
sixer
drinkability
is
fine
but
i
mean
its
just
a
boring
beer
ive
had
much
better
pilsners
had
the
noble
pils
on
draft
a
little
while
back
and
didnt
care
for
it
too
much
but
decided
to
get
a
6er
to
reconsider
i
dont
like
the
name
to
the
point
of
feeling
dumb
ordering
it
of
course
this
is
going
to
taste
better
and
have
more
hop
character
than
the
mainstream
pilsners
but
it
has
trouble
competing
with
the
likes
of
prima
pils
and
even
penn
pilsner
full
disclosure
drowning
your
sorrows
in
a
penn
pilsner
at
pnc
park
on
a
nice
night
is
for
my
money
the
ultimate
pilsner
experience
i
might
even
trade
it
back
in
for
the
spring
ale
i
know
its
a
sam
adams
product
and
everyone
loves
sam
adams
unfortunately
this
one
had
great
promise
but
imho
failed
to
deliver
bright
yellow
to
tan
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
foam
head
and
soft
carbonation
fruity
did
i
mention
fruity
hops
in
the
nose
and
a
nicely
balanced
initial
taste
biscuity
malt
with
a
fruity
then
softly
bitter
hops
flavor
profile
had
it
stayed
there
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
immensely
but
the
flavor
quickly
transitions
to
a
slick
buttery
diacetyl
that
borders
on
undrinkable
sure
theres
some
residual
hops
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
after
a
few
swallows
i
had
to
set
it
aside
just
didnt
cut
it
im
hoping
a
bad
batch
and
ill
try
it
on
tap
to
see
if
its
better
but
this
6
pack
tried
three
so
far
was
fairly
consistent
in
its
lessthanexpected
quality
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
particularly
special
but
certainly
worth
trying
this
would
be
a
great
goto
brew
for
hot
summer
days
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
at
the
beach
or
out
by
the
pool
big
euro
hop
presense
giving
flavors
of
sunflower
seed
and
citrus
pith
medium
bodied
and
bitter
scrubbing
bubbles
carbonation
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
beer
long
dry
finish
which
leaves
the
palet
well
intact
d
this
is
very
good
and
wish
it
was
year
around
this
would
be
great
in
the
summer
time
sa
hit
one
out
of
the
park
with
this
one
d
sessionable
for
sure
great
pick
when
youre
craving
something
light
skål
d
easy
to
finish
nice
flavor
and
a
low
enough
abv
to
be
considered
a
session
beer
ill
look
forward
to
this
every
spring
d
great
one
before
dinner
one
with
dinner
and
one
for
desert
and
its
monday
evening
ill
need
a
little
self
control
to
stay
away
from
the
rest
of
the
sixer
overall
another
solid
brew
from
boston
brewing
im
especially
happy
because
this
replaces
the
white
ale
which
was
easily
my
least
favorite
seasonal
this
is
a
nice
pils
from
sam
adams
and
id
say
its
nearly
on
par
with
the
best
pennsylvania
german
pils
which
are
the
best
of
the
domestic
versions
of
course
the
pa
versions
are
all
a
small
to
a
substantial
in
the
case
of
prima
notch
above
but
this
is
tasty
stuff
indeed
nice
job
bbc
d
a
true
session
beerwhich
wont
overwhelm
the
taste
buds
like
your
typical
hophead
beer
will
but
will
be
apprecieted
by
anyone
with
discriminating
taste
this
beer
makes
you
understand
why
the
1st
pilsners
were
called
even
though
that
phrase
has
been
adulterated
the
champagne
of
beers
drinks
greatvery
refreshing
d
ive
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
all
the
time
not
just
spring
seasonsss
mouthfeel
is
incredible
and
this
beer
is
more
drinkable
than
water
d
phenomenal
pils
possibly
my
favorite
effort
from
sa
very
sessionable
noble
pils
is
a
very
interesting
beer
it
pours
like
a
very
traditional
pilsner
a
slight
citrus
smell
comes
through
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
refreshing
aftertaste
slightly
bitter
the
hops
are
definitely
present
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
especially
for
anyone
who
likes
sam
adams
or
a
good
pilsner
sam
adams
never
seems
to
disappoint
with
their
beers
noble
pils
continues
this
trend
this
is
a
very
nice
americanbrewed
european
pilsner
it
rivals
victory
prima
pils
for
a
great
american
craftbrewed
pilsner
a
very
drinkable
beer
nice
thirst
quencher
and
it
has
a
nice
warm
weather
feel
to
it
it
is
good
to
see
more
quality
domestic
pilsners
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
pilsner
it
is
very
good
and
true
to
a
czech
pilsner
i
never
understood
why
samuel
adams
discontinued
its
year
round
golden
pilsner
from
the
mid
to
late
1990s
d
definitly
could
drink
a
few
and
would
be
fantastic
on
a
warm
spring
day
to
qwench
thirst
drinkability
i
used
to
have
bitburger
pils
as
my
standard
but
this
is
really
quite
good
went
well
with
a
meal
and
i
wish
i
had
another
to
try
out
it
does
exactly
what
a
plisner
should
do
leave
your
palate
refreshed
after
the
meal
drinkability
is
good
nice
solid
enjoyable
and
sessionable
pilsener
overall
an
excellent
brew
just
switch
to
something
cheaper
if
youre
planning
on
drinking
more
than
23
overall
i
am
very
happy
with
this
beer
it
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
session
beer
that
has
good
malt
character
balanced
by
good
hop
character
if
i
brewed
a
pilsener
like
this
i
be
very
happy
rather
disappointed
with
this
one
given
the
hype
and
good
things
i
have
been
hearing
mid
body
beer
good
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
another
good
beer
from
mr
koch
it
poured
straw
yellow
with
a
short
bubbly
white
head
it
left
one
thin
ring
of
lace
on
an
otherwise
clear
glass
the
smell
and
taste
were
nondescript
malty
sweet
the
the
feel
was
bubbly
and
fleeting
it
was
refreshing
and
would
work
well
after
a
workout
or
after
working
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
that
respect
noble
pils
is
better
than
water
but
nothing
about
it
stands
out
this
beer
is
a
completely
clear
golden
color
with
a
modest
white
head
its
a
fine
looking
brew
with
a
great
german
hop
aroma
herbal
spicy
and
soft
its
not
like
an
ipa
theres
some
subtle
pale
malt
and
pilsener
malt
in
the
background
hops
are
centric
in
this
beer
the
taste
is
clean
and
relatively
dry
with
a
great
bitterness
herbal
and
slightly
musty
hop
flavors
there
is
more
malt
in
the
flavor
than
in
the
smell
very
clean
medium
in
body
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
the
finish
is
bitter
with
a
long
lingering
hop
flavor
good
stuff
d
drinkable
a
clean
crisp
refreshing
beer
one
of
the
better
sa
beers
overall
this
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
sam
adams
lineup
and
i
welcome
its
addition
to
the
spring
roster
over
others
such
as
coastal
wheat
tailoring
this
to
incorporate
more
camarel
malt
to
complement
the
fine
noble
hops
would
probably
accentuate
rather
than
tamp
down
the
noble
hops
while
making
the
taste
fuller
and
richer
regardless
good
work
and
one
ill
return
to
again
d
i
would
say
this
is
a
great
session
beer
i
could
put
these
back
all
daynight
rip
sn
esb
i
know
what
i
will
be
seeking
out
next
year
around
this
time
well
done
sam
adams
thanks
for
giving
us
a
great
go
to
spring
beer
d
easy
drinking
pils
great
stuff
from
sa
d
rather
easy
actually
just
be
ready
for
grassy
flavors
and
aftertastes
d
excellent
grillinglawnmower
beer
easily
the
second
best
pils
ive
ever
had
overall
a
decent
pilsner
i
was
expecting
just
a
little
bit
more
out
of
it
and
it
fell
just
short
of
my
expectations
i
think
this
might
be
a
good
crossover
beer
for
people
interested
in
craft
beer
but
scared
away
by
bolder
flavors
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
crisp
golden
hay
thats
so
clear
when
i
hold
it
close
to
the
computer
monitor
i
can
actually
read
the
page
behind
it
the
head
a
good
3inches
and
creamy
white
leaves
behind
pretty
good
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
pilsner
malt
relaying
a
sweet
bready
aroma
just
a
slight
caramel
and
then
a
lemony
brightness
from
the
noble
hops
also
at
the
very
tail
is
a
metallic
aroma
almost
medicinal
as
in
smelling
a
bottle
of
aspirin
the
taste
is
very
similar
there
is
not
much
room
to
hide
anything
a
sweet
bready
pilsner
malt
works
up
the
entirety
of
the
profile
just
a
hint
of
toffee
lemon
rind
and
a
bit
of
spices
from
the
hops
heres
the
kicker
there
is
a
massive
medicinal
flavor
at
the
very
end
of
the
flavor
profile
it
reminds
me
of
when
you
leave
an
aspirin
tablet
sitting
on
your
tongue
a
little
to
long
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
for
the
style
and
it
also
lacks
the
stereotypical
dryness
that
comes
with
so
many
of
its
german
counterparts
i
want
to
like
this
beer
i
mean
really
want
to
like
it
but
im
just
not
that
impressed
with
it
mouthfeel
seems
good
for
the
style
and
not
overcarbonated
there
might
even
be
a
smidge
more
carbonation
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
yellow
and
wheat
colored
frothy
white
head
smell
was
bitter
and
citrusy
taste
was
similar
some
bready
notes
up
front
going
to
pleasantly
bitter
and
hoppy
finish
dry
and
drinkable
plenty
of
taste
compared
to
many
pilsners
overall
great
beer
definitely
will
keep
these
around
the
flavor
is
harsher
than
i
expected
based
on
the
smell
the
hop
has
a
greater
bite
creating
a
more
bitter
pils
the
malt
is
soft
and
light
the
body
is
as
expectedlight
and
crisp
without
being
watery
overall
a
superior
beer
not
bad
much
enjoyed
and
i
will
have
again
final
notes
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
think
that
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
not
perfect
but
its
a
great
go
to
beer
to
have
around
and
i
could
see
how
it
could
turn
bmc
drinkers
towards
craft
beer
one
of
the
better
sa
offerings
in
my
opinion
drinkability
it
was
awful
just
like
the
rating
i
gave
this
beer
it
was
like
carbonated
water
but
its
my
fault
because
i
didnt
use
that
awesome
glass
in
the
commercial
with
the
laser
doop
de
doo
line
in
the
bottom
that
brings
out
all
the
secret
hidden
flavors
in
this
bad
beer
i
am
having
trouble
believing
that
this
and
another
were
just
sitting
as
singles
at
my
local
bottle
shop
yesterday
afternoon
what
a
find
pale
golden
yellow
colored
body
was
clear
and
the
head
was
a
bit
small
at
one
finger
thick
the
smell
was
loaded
with
hops
and
was
closer
to
an
apa
than
a
pils
the
taste
however
did
not
deliver
all
that
hoppy
goodness
the
body
was
crisp
and
clean
with
a
tangy
bitterness
but
not
much
spicy
noble
hop
character
the
body
was
light
and
refreshing
and
the
aftertaste
was
a
lingering
bitterness
very
quaffable
as
a
pils
should
be
but
lacks
the
special
touch
to
put
it
into
an
upper
echelon
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
smooth
biting
carbonation
its
significantly
different
than
the
boston
lager
but
no
less
enjoyable
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
consider
session
able
d
this
is
a
wonderful
drinking
beer
its
light
and
refreshing
without
losing
flavors
on
it
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
and
would
recommend
to
most
people
who
have
never
tried
a
well
made
craft
beer
this
brew
pours
brilliantly
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
whit
head
the
aroma
is
a
traditional
pilsgrainy
malt
spicyfloral
hops
and
a
bit
of
lager
yeast
the
flavor
is
moderately
hoppyslight
amount
of
grass
breadygrainy
malt
flavors
followed
by
a
palate
cleansing
moderate
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
just
a
bit
the
carbonation
is
medium
as
is
the
body
overall
a
very
well
made
pils
on
the
hoppier
side
of
the
styleworth
a
try
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
from
the
bbc
in
a
very
long
time
i
always
thought
that
for
all
the
great
beer
they
brew
they
were
missing
a
good
pale
lager
and
they
really
nailed
it
with
this
beer
they
have
recently
released
some
brews
that
are
somewhat
pedestrian
fruity
as
they
seem
to
want
to
appeal
to
wider
audience
that
said
mr
koch
does
a
good
job
of
remembering
what
his
roots
are
and
i
glad
to
see
them
continue
to
brew
traditional
styles
of
beer
such
as
this
noble
pils
now
if
only
this
were
a
year
round
offering
i
would
be
set
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
d
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
pilsners
that
ive
had
goes
down
easily
great
representation
of
the
style
i
could
enjoy
a
number
of
pints
of
this
beer
beer
is
awesome
although
i
will
say
it
seems
a
bit
odd
to
release
it
in
february
i
think
if
i
drank
it
in
april
the
mouthfeel
rating
would
be
upped
a
bit
but
its
a
bit
light
for
a
30
degree
day
do
very
refreshing
says
seasonal
brew
on
the
label
and
then
mentions
spring
but
may
be
best
to
have
a
few
in
the
summertime
sam
adams
had
a
contest
between
this
and
a
pale
ale
to
see
what
would
be
the
next
beer
they
mass
produced
i
voted
for
this
one
at
the
great
lakes
brewfest
in
racine
wi
back
in
september
glad
this
won
have
bought
a
couple
6ers
of
it
since
its
became
available
in
my
area
would
recommend
to
pilsner
fans
as
an
alternate
to
the
well
established
widely
available
pils
pilsner
urquell
etc
overall
an
excellent
pilsener
that
overcomes
the
flavor
and
aroma
shortcomings
that
are
too
present
in
most
of
the
others
ive
had
this
one
is
done
right
high
recommend
rotation
seasonal
available
here
in
tx
worthy
of
a
6xer
maybe
2
during
the
season
also
would
be
a
good
best
choice
option
on
tap
the
mouthfeel
is
active
crisp
and
refreshing
again
the
light
spiciness
compliments
the
pinprick
carbonation
id
say
the
bodys
a
shade
on
the
heavy
side
for
the
style
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
eclipsing
the
honey
porter
its
right
up
there
with
prima
pils
as
far
as
pilsners
from
this
side
of
the
pond
go
sams
did
a
decent
job
with
this
but
theres
room
for
improvement
getting
rid
of
that
slight
skunkiness
others
have
mentioned
would
instantly
make
this
brew
twice
as
good
in
my
opinion
i
would
love
it
if
noble
pils
became
a
staple
on
the
taps
of
less
craftoriented
bars
and
restaurants
though
because
its
good
enough
to
have
a
place
in
the
kind
of
bars
and
stores
that
bas
prefer
to
frequent
to
engage
in
some
ba
forum
comparison
nonsense
its
a
bit
weaker
in
the
nose
than
prima
pils
and
not
quite
as
balanced
but
in
all
i
think
i
prefer
the
taste
of
noble
pils
sam
adams
would
be
smart
to
make
this
a
staple
yearround
offering
poured
to
a
big
2
fingered
head
with
lots
of
big
bubbles
brew
itself
was
a
very
clear
golden
color
had
some
lacing
smelled
i
thought
on
the
light
side
just
of
some
hops
and
had
a
slightly
sweet
smell
and
mild
notes
of
citrus
tasted
of
bitter
hops
and
had
a
slight
citrus
taste
also
had
a
slight
better
aftertaste
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
right
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
alcohol
is
not
that
high
so
you
could
enjoy
all
night
d
very
drinkable
and
great
session
beer
d
im
not
generally
the
biggest
lager
fan
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
but
not
amazing
effort
which
is
what
you
expect
from
sam

reviewed

purchased
new
from
kmart
the
is
a
really
good
pils
refreshing
and
enjoyable
drinkability
what
an
excellent
replacement
for
their
white
ale
an
excellent
well
balanced
pilsner
that
might
just
be
sas
best
new
beer
in
the
past
couple
of
years
very
solid
and
so
easy
to
drink
i
cant
wait
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
spring
day
wow
really
good
beer
and
a
german
pils
too
boot
too
poured
with
an
average
fine
foamy
white
head
that
mostly
settled
down
and
a
little
lace
aroma
is
very
floral
perfumey
citrus
hoppy
and
a
little
malty
and
grainy
flavors
different
bitterness
is
much
more
prominant
body
is
a
touch
softer
than
for
a
perfect
pils
good
carbonation
great
clean
refreshing
finish
session
beer
for
sure
drinkability
excellent
makes
a
very
nice
hoppy
session
beer
i
terribly
enjoyed
this
brew
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
beer
should
be
a
year
round
brew
it
certainly
made
me
do
a
double
take
on
the
pils
genre
this
beer
is
amazing
for
what
it
is
a
light
crisp
lager
with
lots
of
light
low
alpha
noble
hops
with
a
great
hop
flavor
and
aroma
poured
into
a
classic
pilsner
glass
the
beer
is
a
pretty
deep
golden
color
with
a
white
head
of
dense
foam
the
aroma
is
appealing
with
slight
citrus
and
plenty
of
clean
hop
notes
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
that
of
your
typical
pils
with
each
of
the
five
noble
hop
varieties
used
hallertau
tettnanger
spalt
saaz
hersbrucker
making
their
presence
known
crisp
and
clean
on
the
palate
with
plenty
of
carbonation
very
refreshing
just
like
a
good
pilsner
should
be
not
sure
why
this
is
their
january
to
march
seasonal
id
think
a
brew
like
this
would
be
more
appropriate
to
warmer
weather
despite
that
its
an
excellent
beer
if
youre
a
fan
of
pilsners
and
who
isnt
you
should
give
it
a
try
drinkability
this
beer
brings
great
drinkability
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
and
lower
abv
a
good
session
brew
probably
one
of
the
winners
of
sam
adams
lineup
this
year
pours
a
golden
shimmery
clear
with
a
quarter
inch
head
slight
citrus
smell
smells
clean
if
that
makes
sense
the
taste
is
balanced
a
little
bit
of
citrus
as
expected
i
also
think
that
with
more
hops
this
could
be
killer
as
is
its
pretty
damn
tasty
balanced
not
overpowering
in
any
direction
clean
and
drinkable
good
offering
from
the
bbc
the
only
problem
with
noble
pils
as
the
brewerys
new
spring
seasonal
is
that
the
release
date
is
in
january
by
the
time
spring
rolls
around
in
most
of
the
country
the
hoppiness
that
is
the
beers
linchpin
for
success
will
be
but
a
shadow
of
its
former
self
it
is
pretty
tasty
right
now
though
drink
easy
to
drink
out
of
the
tap
or
the
bottle
this
is
a
dandy
loved
it
d
easy
to
drink
partially
due
to
its
blandness
yet
can
be
a
very
good
casual
session
beer
body
is
lively
and
wellcarbonated
as
a
pilsner
should
be
this
is
a
wellbalanced
easydrinking
lager
one
that
im
sure
ill
pick
up
again
in
the
warmer
days
of
summer
the
local
outback
had
it
on
tap
just
waiting
on
the
beer
store
so
i
can
pick
up
a
6
pack
and
try
it
bottled
most
of
sas
beers
are
run
of
the
mill
mass
appeal
stabs
at
craft
styles
noble
pils
serves
as
an
all
too
rare
reminder
that
sa
is
still
capable
of
greatness
if
only
occasionally
this
is
my
new
go
to
session
beer
at
least
while
its
in
season
pours
a
clear
golden
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
floral
hops
hop
oils
slight
herbs
sweet
malt
and
slight
earthy
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
german
pilsner
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
floral
hops
hop
oils
slight
sweet
malt
herbal
and
slight
earthy
malt
overall
a
good
body
blend
and
drinkability
d
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
not
only
does
it
have
the
hop
flavor
but
its
refreshing
and
impressively
thirstquenching
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
without
getting
bored
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
pilsener
and
is
a
must
for
any
hoplover
to
try
i
imagine
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
drink
in
the
warmer
months
but
im
still
content
to
have
under
the
feet
of
snow
weve
been
getting
in
north
carolina
all
in
all
this
was
one
of
the
most
impressive
releases
to
come
from
jim
koch
and
company
in
recent
memory
well
done
more
complex
than
any
pilsner
i
have
ever
had
taste
of
hops
is
mostly
a
lime
like
taste
with
just
a
little
bit
of
grassyness
malt
flavor
is
sweet
and
chewy
d
i
guess
if
this
is
one
of
the
best
pilseners
i
need
to
just
drink
and
enjoy
but
i
will
stick
to
other
styles
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
good
its
light
pretty
refreshing
and
an
easy
drinking
beer
overall
its
a
very
good
representation
of
its
style
as
well
all
in
all
a
nice
easy
beer
would
be
great
for
a
warm
summer
day
easy
to
gulp
if
you
want
and
a
real
thirst
quencher
kind
of
what
macro
lagers
pretend
to
be
but
arent
hard
not
to
recommend
trying
it
d
id
like
the
hops
to
be
a
bit
more
assertive
yet
this
is
still
a
tasty
quaff
and
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
d
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
ill
probably
have
this
again
when
i
see
it
but
there
are
better
amerixan
examples
of
the
style
i
think
d
this
is
an
unbelievably
drinkable
beer
as
can
be
expected
from
sam
adams
but
there
is
still
so
much
interest
to
the
palate
in
this
beer
it
would
be
amazing
as
a
springsummer
beer
as
it
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
without
sacrificing
any
body
or
character
its
no
wonder
jim
koch
chose
this
beer
to
serve
at
his
daughters
wedding
its
also
no
wonder
the
sam
adams
brewery
brought
it
back
damn
good
brew
that
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
right
at
the
brewery
on
tap
in
a
7
oz
tasting
glass
noble
pils
is
a
beer
that
if
you
have
not
had
it
yet
you
must
go
out
and
by
it
the
first
sip
is
key
the
beer
was
like
heaven
in
my
mouth
full
of
flavor
and
very
airy
the
smell
was
mesmorizing
and
highly
recommend
that
you
bring
this
beer
to
a
party
cause
i
guarentee
that
you
will
become
the
life
of
the
party
d
easy
to
drink
just
not
my
favorite
style
in
the
end
im
impressed
by
this
new
offering
from
sam
a
pretty
good
value
beer
thats
eminently
drinkable
would
like
to
perceive
more
of
those
five
noble
hop
varieties
though
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
the
flavor
profile
is
decent
but
im
not
as
impressed
as
most
the
abv
is
on
the
low
end
which
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
experience
and
overall
the
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
consume
d
very
easy
drinker
and
while
hoppy
this
is
not
the
americanstyle
hop
bomb
not
surprisingly
this
one
tastes
very
much
like
a
pilsner
should
my
dad
likes
it
great
beer
for
a
warm
spring
or
summer
day
normally
not
a
big
fan
of
sam
adams
beers
but
this
one
is
a
winner
and
a
true
to
the
pilsner
style
d
sam
adams
has
always
been
known
for
drinkable
beers
and
this
is
certainly
no
exception
but
rather
the
defining
nature
of
drinkability
a
good
sense
of
noble
hops
gives
this
a
very
appreciable
nose
and
flavor
while
maintaining
a
smooth
and
very
good
balance
making
this
go
down
with
incredible
ease
and
delight
probably
one
of
the
best
drinking
beers
period
let
alone
per
style
this
one
will
serve
as
my
gold
standard
as
the
perfect
drinkability
example
if
this
was
year
round
this
would
be
my
go
to
beer
and
incredibly
priced
at
25
a
case
you
certainly
are
not
gonna
get
a
better
experience
per
dollar
keg
worthy
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
found
it
a
great
contrast
to
the
many
very
hoppy
and
high
alcohol
bombs
that
craft
brewers
seem
to
be
brewing
in
greater
volume
the
beer
pours
our
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
slight
amount
of
carbonation
looks
a
lot
like
apple
juice
the
smell
is
a
blend
of
bitter
hops
very
crisp
the
taste
does
not
follow
the
smell
i
get
a
small
hop
presence
in
the
taste
with
the
malt
sort
of
overwhelming
the
other
tastes
tastes
like
the
same
malt
that
is
in
boston
lager
not
impressed
but
after
a
few
the
taste
has
grown
on
me
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
normal
but
not
very
substantial
and
a
bit
watery
the
beer
really
shines
in
its
drinkability
as
it
goes
down
smooth
high
drinkability
refreshing
and
tasty
overall
pretty
drinkable
with
nice
clean
hop
flavor
throughouta
bit
like
a
subdued
american
pale
ale
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
on
a
summer
day
the
light
character
wouldnt
necessarily
match
with
heavy
bbq
or
burgers
but
spicy
bratwurst
with
mustard
and
sauerkraut
would
be
ideal
i
paired
it
with
a
spicy
pasta
norteña
and
was
very
very
happy
it
would
be
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
by
the
lake
with
grilled
fish
also
alternating
sipping
this
with
a
traditional
hefeweizen
would
make
for
a
great
summer
session
probably
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
sam
adams
to
date
drinkable
flavorful
and
ideal
for
the
style
try
pairing
with
shrimp
or
pasta
libation
this
is
very
sessionable
refreshing
pilsner
the
5
2
abv
is
a
bit
sneaky
based
upon
how
easily
these
go
down
the
5
noble
hops
used
in
this
brew
combine
nicely
though
im
not
able
to
determine
any
ones
other
than
saaz
by
the
flavor
alone
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
flavorful
enough
to
be
the
perfect
introduction
for
noncraft
beer
drinkers
hand
someone
this
instead
of
their
miller
or
bud
and
id
be
shocked
if
they
went
back
to
their
macro
brews
the
taste
price
flavor
and
refreshment
factors
here
make
this
a
great
beer
ill
be
happy
to
have
again
pilsner
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
variety
of
beer
but
i
can
respect
a
good
one
and
the
noble
pils
is
a
good
pilsner
well
done
samuel
adams
poured
from
a
pint
bottle
with
may
notched
on
the
label
a
clear
gold
into
a
pilsner
glass
a
finger
thick
pure
white
head
couple
of
sticky
rings
and
spotty
lace
down
the
glass
hops
of
course
light
perfumy
aroma
and
a
sugar
sweet
smell
with
some
fruitorange
taste
toasty
biscuit
great
complex
hop
flavors
and
only
a
slight
bitter
on
the
end
that
doesnt
linger
carbonation
is
really
active
popping
around
and
leaves
a
noticeable
tingle
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
fitting
for
the
season
yeah
ill
pick
this
up
again
sam
adams
did
good
here
snowy
white
head
that
fades
leaving
chunky
lace
average
gold
color
medium
scent
of
hops
bitter
but
not
flowery
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
soapy
flavor
all
the
way
through
some
hops
but
mainly
bitter
and
soapy
with
a
processed
taste
like
cardboard
or
paper
easy
to
drink
but
no
payoff
i
have
to
follow
this
one
up
with
an
ale
or
a
stout
to
feel
like
ive
accomplished
something
good
job
boston
beer
co
and
jim
koch
this
pils
is
for
real
md
bubbly
but
not
overdone
obviously
very
drinkable
due
to
the
style
overall
a
nice
beer
i
cant
deicide
between
this
or
the
victory
this
goes
a
little
to
the
hoppier
side
vs
prima
pils
so
it
depends
on
your
mood
if
you
like
hoppy
crisp
and
clean
beer
then
you
will
like
this
one
with
a
citrus
kick
low
aroma
of
pale
malt
some
citrus
and
floral
hoppiness
flavors
of
bready
malt
some
yeastiness
floral
notes
followed
by
citrus
hops
and
orange
peel
bitters
morphs
to
pine
becomes
a
bit
spicy
in
the
finish
tending
a
bit
toward
harsh
a
bit
husky
even
mouthfeel
pretty
tingly
and
gassy
dry
and
crisp
a
bit
tannic
tending
almost
toward
harsh
decent
drinkability
expected
more
hops
and
smoothness
definitely
try
this
one
out
cheers
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
int
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
a
thick
white
foam
head
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
rising
within
the
glass
this
is
a
great
looking
pilsner
it
has
a
great
grassy
aroma
it
reminds
me
of
being
in
a
field
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
sweetness
up
front
it
has
a
dry
finish
and
a
moderately
bitter
hop
aftertaste
its
not
an
outstanding
taste
but
is
enjoyable
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
that
i
feel
and
not
too
much
mouthcoating
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
combination
of
a
light
body
and
no
overwhelming
flavors
makes
me
think
just
about
any
beer
drinker
could
down
at
least
one
bottle
easily
i
hope
that
a
beer
that
is
this
accessible
from
such
a
widely
available
brewery
will
allow
a
number
of
people
to
enter
into
the
world
of
craft
beers
d
very
high
i
will
be
emptying
a
case
of
this
today
d
very
easy
to
drink
could
easily
sit
down
and
drink
a
few
of
these
without
even
thinking
about
it
overall
this
is
a
truly
great
pils
its
making
me
think
of
summer
and
simultaneously
wish
i
had
a
big
juicy
hamburger
very
much
worth
trying
so
happy
sa
is
expanding
their
line
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
very
refreshing
pilsner
wonderful
malt
background
that
is
present
but
not
overpowering
its
a
great
profile
for
the
noble
hops
i
cannot
distinguish
all
five
noble
hops
individually
but
you
can
tell
right
away
its
noble
very
delicate
hop
flavor
and
dry
finish
make
this
highly
drinkable
great
way
to
introduce
someone
to
hops
without
overwhelming
them
wow
what
a
wonderful
beer
it
is
different
from
the
german
pilsners
i
have
had
in
that
there
is
more
sweet
malt
i
will
gladly
buy
this
beer
again
especially
at
12
99
a
twelvepack
this
is
a
winner
in
the
pilsner
category
in
my
book
still
lags
behind
victorys
prima
pils
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
as
that
beer
is
almost
in
a
category
of
its
own
very
solid
offering
from
bbc
reaffirming
my
belief
that
they
know
what
they
are
doing
most
of
the
time
the
solid
hops
presence
wellbalanced
flavor
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
make
this
one
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
it
sets
light
on
the
gut
overall
a
great
beer
the
first
one
that
i
have
tried
with
5
different
kinds
of
hops
a
different
taste
than
other
hoppy
beers
not
too
carbonated
which
i
love
sometimes
the
ipas
can
be
a
bit
strong
on
the
carbonation
side
i
feel
i
agree
that
this
should
be
a
summer
release
but
now
is
a
pretty
good
time
to
drink
a
few
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
of
these
in
one
sitting
as
for
right
now
this
late
maybe
not
i
feel
this
beer
would
be
exceptionally
good
on
tap
but
as
of
now
havent
been
able
to
find
it
a
big
problem
with
this
beer
is
it
should
be
a
summer
release
i
bet
it
would
beat
the
heat
soooo
nicely
in
the
garage
or
on
the
porch
o
well
better
now
than
never
in
my
opinion
this
seems
like
a
worthy
foe
to
victorys
prima
pils
it
isnt
as
biting
and
its
only
a
seasonal
brew
however
if
i
see
this
in
a
6
pack
ill
do
a
sidebyside
comparison
with
prima
pils
certainly
a
gem
in
a
12
pack
thats
worth
savoring
oveall
i
could
deffinatly
drink
a
sixer
of
this
anyday
yum
yum
overall
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
six
pack
instead
of
just
a
single
because
i
could
have
drank
several
of
these
during
the
super
bowl
tomorrow
oh
well
bright
clear
light
yellow
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
fine
bubbled
pure
white
head
that
laces
a
bit
on
the
way
down
the
smell
is
clean
aromatic
and
herbal
hoppines
there
is
a
light
balance
of
pilsner
malt
but
for
the
most
part
the
smell
is
just
very
fresh
hops
my
first
impression
was
of
opening
a
bag
of
hops
while
homebrewing
the
taste
is
a
base
of
pale
malts
with
nothing
really
assertive
on
the
malt
side
as
the
real
player
is
the
hops
a
full
range
of
flavor
from
grasses
to
herbs
to
a
bit
of
lemon
and
pepper
is
some
of
what
you
get
the
mouthfeel
too
is
good
lively
and
light
with
a
healthy
level
of
carbonation
that
keeps
things
quite
tingly
the
finish
is
clean
and
pretty
dry
with
a
lingering
bitterness
from
the
hops
overall
this
is
a
really
good
offering
personally
im
much
happier
with
this
than
i
was
with
the
old
spring
seasonal
the
white
ale
not
only
is
it
a
good
spring
beer
from
sam
but
a
solid
example
of
the
german
pils
this
beer
has
a
good
feel
and
goes
down
real
easy
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
bite
i
will
drink
this
again
though
1pt

fl
oz

served
in

best
by
may

on

poured
a
translucent
pale
gold
with
a
one
inch
loose
bright
white
head
some
specks
and
strands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
session

character
and

a
slight
cereal
grain
quality
comes
out
in
the
mix
but
very
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
and
in
carbonation
im
not
a
huge
pilsener
fan
but
this
one
work
for
me
clean
simple
flavorful
and
sessionable
probably
one
of
the
best
from
sam
adams
in
some
time
d
this
beer
was
good
overall
but
it
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
thought
pilsners
were
generally
balanced
with
their
malt
and
hops
flavors
while
not
too
bitter
this
beer
definitely
had
a
hops
dominant
aroma
and
taste
while
people
who
really
like
the
flavor
of
hops
might
enjoy
this
version
of
a
pilsner
i
prefer
pilsners
that
have
a
balanced
flavor
profile
i
would
still
drink
this
again
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
white
frothy
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
floral
hops
with
some
earthy
tones
over
a
sweet
malt
backbone
and
a
hint
of
lemonzest
the
taste
is
of
floral
hops
with
some
earthy
hops
as
well
over
top
of
a
sweet
malt
backbone
there
is
also
a
hint
of
lemonzest
and
small
hint
of
orange
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
the
drinkability
is
very
high
you
can
drink
a
six
pack
of
these
easy
it
goes
down
very
smooth
noble
pils
has
generated
quite
the
buzz
in
a
short
period
of
time
given
that
my
expectations
were
quite
high
the
verdict
its
good
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
buzz
would
suggest
its
a
solid
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
wow
in
any
way
having
said
that
it
is
a
tasty
beer
thats
sessionable
in
my
book
pretty
good
stuff
well
worth
checking
out
drinkability
drinkability
is
good
ill
probably
give
away
the
rest
of
the
sixer
d
ill
go
for
the
bottle
again
but
i
will
pass
on
the
ontap
version
in
the
future
im
not
sure
if
it
is
that
beers
in
bars
are
frequently
served
too
cold
maybe
that
was
part
of
the
muted
taste
in
this
brew
but
this
was
a
big
disappointment
as
the
bottled
sa
noble
pils
is
one
of
my
highest
rated
beers
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
the
malt
character
is
good
but
the
hops
take
center
stage
in
this
beer
the
flavor
of
the
hops
gives
the
beer
character
through
the
middle
and
the
biting
bitterness
makes
for
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
i
rarely
buy
six
packs
if
i
can
avoid
it
but
i
am
more
than
happy
to
have
five
more
of
these
in
my
fridge
its
nice
to
see
another
real
pilsner
from
an
american
brewery
heres
hoping
we
keep
seeing
more
overall
impression
great
seasonal
from
sam
hope
they
keep
it
in
the
future
line
up
i
will
start
to
look
for
this
one
like
i
do
the
sa
oktoberfest
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
spring
time
beer
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
was
an
excellent
germanstyle
pils
so
delicious
on
its
own
but
also
very
foodfriendly
finished
clean
and
dry
i
can
see
german
pils
drinkers
loving
this
it
should
be
a
yearround
selection
one
of
the
more
intriguing
sam
adams
beers
this
could
be
very
popular
in
a
category
in
which
we
need
more
good
american
entries
pours
a
clear
light
golden
hue
with
a
fluffy
white
head
of
about
an
inch
or
so
the
head
didnt
have
a
lot
of
retention
its
nice
having
a
pilsener
that
smells
of
some
hops
with
orange
peel
a
touch
of
pine
and
the
slightest
hint
of
mango
theres
also
a
malty
sweetness
in
the
nose
i
thought
the
taste
was
fantastic
for
this
style
definitely
has
grassy
lemon
notes
as
others
have
noted
the
malty
sweetness
shows
itself
for
a
short
time
before
being
taken
back
over
by
a
crisp
and
bitter
finish
that
leaves
a
slight
alfalfa
sprout
note
i
wasnt
really
expecting
anything
special
but
this
is
now
one
of
my
faves
from
the
bbc
id
like
to
see
it
in
the
summer
as
well
this
was
served
in
a
tall
pilsner
glass
a
very
nice
gold
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
faded
quickly
the
noble
pils
had
a
nice
hop
nose
and
hints
of
roasted
malt
a
toasty
flavor
with
a
crisp
hop
finish
very
crisp
feel
very
drinkable
and
well
hopped
pilsner
d
this
is
a
great
tasting
pilsener
really
is
one
of
the
hoppiest
ive
ever
had
and
almost
tastes
like
an
apa
di
think
i
understand
why
everyone
likes
this
so
much
but
the
citrus
aftertaste
is
really
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
pils
i
enjoyed
this
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
of
pilsners
it
was
very
nice
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
sam
adams
fan
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
they
have
produced
that
i
have
tasted
i
will
definitely
try
this
one
again
i
recommend
it
for
a
different
slant
on
the
typical
pils
enjoy
prosit
drinkability
way
high
this
is
going
to
be
a
repeat
purchase
for
me
i
can
tell
its
not
quite
as
ballsy
a
pils
as
say
prima
or
pikeland
pills
but
it
is
flavorful
unique
and
incredibly
pleasant
and
sessionable
good
job
sam
adams
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
am
completely
blown
away
by
this
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
available
year
round
and
in
every
sampler
pack
simple
awesome
d
a
very
drinkable
pils
one
of
sam
adams
best
and
a
good
sessionable
lager
which
is
an
easy
drinker
a
good
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
coarse
in
texture
i
will
return
to
this
one
often
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
settles
quickly
to
just
cover
the
beer
and
a
light
lace
hoppy
nose
with
a
slight
bitter
citrus
note
strong
hop
malt
bready
taste
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
lively
carbonation
not
bad
but
i
would
rather
have
a
german
or
chech
pils
anytine
d
goes
down
easily
a
very
drinkable
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
hops
some
notes
of
lemon
taste
like
it
smells
hops
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
malts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
brew
overall
its
enjoyable
but
not
exceptional
for
2
more
i
would
go
for
the
prima
pils
d
im
pretty
impressed
by
the
new
samuel
adams
spring
seasonal
this
is
far
better
than
the
old
white
ale
as
a
widelyavailable
pils
this
is
just
a
little
shy
of
victorys
robust
prima
pils
although
this
one
wins
in
terms
drinkability
and
wellroundedness
tastes
of
hops
light
sweet
malt
lemon
orange
peel
light
caramel
roasted
grains
apple
or
grapes
grass
and
yeast
the
brew
is
light
and
has
very
light
carbonation
with
a
semicreamy
feel
on
the
tongue
a
nice
light
hoppy
beer
that
went
very
well
with
mexican
food
and
had
a
nice
hoppy
taste
throughout
but
the
one
knock
was
that
it
was
not
extremely
flavorful
the
hops
jumped
out
at
initial
contact
and
hit
you
in
the
nose
but
then
the
beer
just
seems
to
taper
off
in
a
muted
way
until
the
dry
finish
its
a
decent
beer
thats
above
average
but
just
ok
i
would
have
it
again
as
it
was
very
drinkable
oh
yeah
this
one
is
worth
the
hype
hope
it
becomes
a
standard
beer
for
sam
adams
and
gets
rid
of
one
of
the
repetitive
wheat
beers
perfectly
transparent
straw
yellow
beer
with
a
nice
fizzy
head
you
could
read
this
post
through
this
beer
the
familiar
beer
smell
of
pilsner
malts
fills
the
nose
and
is
chased
by
soft
aromas
of
hay
and
light
citrus
lemon
clean
malt
taste
with
pleasant
sulfury
finish
spicy
earthy
grassy
and
tart
citrus
flavors
settle
on
the
tongue
linger
for
a
time
and
slowly
dissipate
as
the
hop
oils
volatilize
this
beer
has
a
crisp
semidry
mouthfeel
with
effervescent
carbonation
long
lasting
hop
flavor
yearns
to
be
savored
and
slows
down
consumption
however
there
is
no
question
this
would
be
an
outstanding
session
beer
wow
i
was
glad
i
got
this
to
try
appearance
is
just
like
most
pils
but
the
smell
is
great
smell
of
grass
honeysuckle
with
some
spiciness
taste
is
great
glides
across
tongue
what
is
this
it
finishes
like
a
nice
white
wine
of
all
things
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
very
nice
drinking
for
the
coming
spring
toasted
malt
and
hop
bitterness
up
front
herbal
spicy
and
grassy
flavors
biscuit
malt
lightly
dipped
in
honey
forms
a
nice
backbone
mineral
water
and
minty
hop
flavorsbitterness
into
the
finish
fresh
hop
resin
and
light
citrus
add
in
to
the
mix
in
the
finish
lingering
bready
malt
crisp
clean
dry
finish
moderate
body
with
a
lively
refreshing
feel
very
nice
one
of
the
best
germanstyle
pilseners
ive
had
though
it
is
not
a
victory
prima
pils
it
takes
on
its
own
hop
profile
that
i
will
not
say
rivals
the
victory
prima
but
it
is
in
the
same
ballpark
with
an
entirely
different
flavor
profile
the
victory
is
a
very
dry
and
refreshing
pils
and
this
one
is
more
of
a
juicy
and
bold
pils
i
will
say
that
neither
overshadows
one
another
as
they
are
both
diffferent
takes
on
the
style
all
in
all
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
that
i
wish
they
would
make
year
round
as
i
miss
the
early
days
of
great
pilseners
baderbrau
garten
brau
special
hometown
blonde
just
to
name
a
few
a
must
try
for
pilsener
fans
do
not
let
this
one
slip
through
the
cracks
md
really
easy
going
and
far
more
drinkable
to
me
than
the
standard
pils
smooth
too
bad
this
is
only
a
spring
beer
i
could
easily
see
enjoying
many
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
watching
a
ballgame
what
can
i
say
that
i
havent
already
said
with
the
numbers
it
looks
pretty
and
then
takes
a
turn
for
the
worse
the
flavor
starts
slightly
bready
and
the
hop
flavor
gives
it
a
muddy
vinous
twist
as
the
beer
warms
it
morphs
in
a
chemical
dance
of
solvents
and
cardboard
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
order
another
one
i
hope
and
pray
that
the
bottles
are
a
better
solution
i
mean
i
love
boston
lager
that
is
my
go
to
everyday
beer
but
this
one
missed
the
mark
i
blame
the
keg
stupid
caustics
i
hates
em
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
light
and
refreshing
and
quite
tasty
when
the
weather
is
a
little
warmer
i
will
surely
be
enjoying
many
of
these
taste
the
sweetness
is
higher
than
in
any
other
pilsner
ive
had
but
sam
adams
beers
are
often
fairly
sweet
the
hops
are
definitely
the
central
focus
of
this
beer
though
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
well
suited
for
summerspring
brew
drinkability
an
outstanding
pils
that
even
beats
out
many
of
its
european
counterparts
great
hop
depth
and
a
solid
malt
backbone
make
this
hoppy
but
still
pretty
wellrounded
most
samuel
adams
beers
are
very
good
or
at
the
very
least
faithful
interpretations
of
the
styles
they
represent
but
this
one
is
exceptional
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
good
carbonation
and
and
excellent
nose
a
great
addition
to
the
sammy
lineup
great
drinkability
not
the
most
challenging
pils
but
i
could
go
through
a
sixer
of
this
during
a
ball
or
bbq
no
problem
only
going
on
memory
but
i
thought
the
czech
pils
they
did
about
10
years
ago
was
more
to
my
liking
overall
not
bad
for
a
sam
adams
beer
i
still
like
the
imperial
pilsner
better
but
this
is
an
easy
drinker
lots
of
flavor
as
well
i
wish
i
had
this
beer
in
the
spring
it
would
make
a
great
seasonal
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
light
bubbly
carbonation
makes
this
beer
really
easy
to
drink
very
fun
sensations
though
i
do
miss
the
white
ale
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
finger
of
white
head
fair
amount
of
retension
and
lace
clinging
to
the
glassware
nose
has
an
enjoyable
amount
of
herbal
and
grassy
hop
character
with
some
spice
and
citrus
filling
out
the
rest
of
the
aroma
flavor
is
equally
as
mixed
with
hops
herbal
grassy
and
citrusy
nice
amount
of
hop
bitterness
with
this
but
it
doesnt
overpower
all
the
flavor
characteristics
the
hops
have
to
offer
light
feel
with
a
moderate
to
high
carb
level
it
finishes
clean
little
bit
warming
for
5
and
is
quite
drinkable
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
not
crazy
about
the
flavor
profile
but
it
is
interesting
nonetheless
a
truly
great
recipe
from
samuel
adams
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
nice
foamy
white
head
with
a
bright
golden
body
carbonation
is
high
the
aroma
of
earthy
floral
hops
is
present
before
you
get
the
glass
to
your
face
the
taste
hits
you
with
a
clean
crisp
bite
and
the
carbonation
gives
you
a
little
tingle
on
your
tongue
true
to
style
this
one
is
perfect
as
a
session
brew
jim
and
the
boys
got
this
one
right
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
balanced
beer
that
is
refreshing
thoughts
for
a
pilsner
this
is
pretty
good
i
felt
the
taste
was
a
just
a
little
lacking
but
not
so
much
that
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
i
wouldnt
drop
everything
i
was
doing
for
this
beer
but
i
would
choose
it
over
many
others
for
a
nonlocal
craft
brew
this
is
great
another
good
one
from
sam
adams
im
tempted
to
give
this
beer
a
higher
rating
but
the
lack
of
quality
ingredients
like
found
in
local
craft
brews
prevents
me
from
doing
so
this
is
a
great
beer
and
maybe
coming
from
a
local
craft
brewery
would
have
the
potential
to
be
really
good
a
great
offering
from
sa
none
the
less
it
just
leaves
alot
of
unfulfilled
potential
coming
from
a
mass
producer
like
sa
excellent
have
had
a
22oz
bottle
on
2
occcasions
and
enjoyed
every
sip
my
only
nitpick
is
that
it
could
be
a
touch
more
hoppy
on
the
flavor
side
as
opposed
to
the
ingredients
but
there
are
several
alternatives
in
that
department
that
dont
have
the
balance
that
this
does
but
thats
a
minor
quibble
a
firstclass
american
beer
bravo
jim
koch
d
great
i
find
that
most
samual
adams
brews
taste
similar
and
i
actually
mentioned
it
to
the
fellow
at
the
store
i
bought
this
from
he
told
me
this
was
a
step
away
from
that
and
i
will
agree
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
typical
samual
adams
beer
for
a
pils
i
dunno
how
much
better
it
can
get
the
rave
reveiws
are
on
spot
this
beer
is
awesome
while
it
didnt
take
away
the
cold
mn
night
tonight
it
did
bring
back
some
memories
of
summer
and
makes
me
get
all
giddy
for
spring
when
im
gonna
drink
the
hell
outta
this
beer
if
you
know
someone
who
wants
to
get
into
ipas
but
its
still
too
much
for
them
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
start
at
absolutely
respectable
but
tasteful
this
beer
is
a
gentleman
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
that
favors
american
aggression
but
with
german
ingredients
tasty
for
sure
but
the
hops
are
over
bearing
d
i
could
do
this
beer
all
day
why
is
this
a
late
winter
seasonal
and
not
a
summer
beer
smells
great
citrus
and
hops
is
what
i
got
starts
with
a
crisp
hoppy
flavor
and
then
the
malt
bomb
hits
you
tasty
i
do
not
regret
eating
my
tasteless
fried
shrimp
tonight
the
beer
was
well
worth
it
very
refreshing
i
really
hope
this
hits
the
shelves
locally
soon
and
stays
there
drinkability
very
good
replacement
for
the
white
ale
i
wish
that
sam
adams
decides
to
brew
this
year
round
very
sessionable
just
found
out
the
white
ale
i
love
has
been
replaced
by
this
new
beer
well
lets
give
it
a
try
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
nice
head
to
it
nice
crisp
hop
smell
to
it
taste
is
medium
bodied
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
a
good
hop
bite
to
it
but
well
balanced
in
the
back
end
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilseners
but
this
is
a
damn
good
one
maybe
even
a
little
lemonlime
zest
sort
of
taste
at
the
tail
end
very
drinkable
and
a
great
beer
to
get
once
the
temp
starts
warming
back
up
not
too
happy
my
white
ale
is
no
longer
in
production
here
but
this
is
a
solid
replacement
drinkability
smooth
and
refreshing
a
very
solid
pilsener
an
excellent
offering
from
sam
adams
i
dont
crave
pilseners
too
often
but
this
is
an
excellent
one
well
done
d
very
traditional
take
on
the
style
lots
of
hops
but
it
is
balanced
well
this
would
be
a
great
summer
drinker
well
done
d
overall
a
pleasant
very
drinkable
brew
just
seems
sort
of
flat
and
too
sweet
not
quite
what
i
expected
for
the
style
not
as
coarse
as
most
pilsners
sloppy
pour
resulted
in
2
finger
rapidly
rising
head
fairly
quick
dissipation
with
no
lacing
light
gold
body
carbonation
rising
from
bottom
of
glass
pretty
big
hop
hit
in
the
hose
for
the
style
balanced
by
dry
sweet
maltiness
the
hops
arent
as
pronounced
on
the
tastebuds
but
this
is
a
bit
sweet
for
the
style
for
my
liking
akin
to
prima
pils
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
fairly
dry
finish
sessionable
to
be
honest
im
not
that
impressed
rather
do
the
real
german
deal
or
trumer
pils
drinkability
this
is
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
little
light
up
front
really
almost
bit
simple
but
the
finish
is
the
high
point
obvisouly
though
could
be
a
great
session
beer
for
my
buck
though
for
a
great
example
of
this
style
is
victorys
prima
pils
slaps
this
around
bad
but
overall
a
nice
offering
cheers
well
made
european
pilsner
hits
on
many
of
the
notes
of
victory
prima
pils
my
gold
standard
but
flavor
falls
a
bit
short
drinkability
is
good
maybe
sa
will
make
this
pils
year
round
beer
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
go
to
summer
beer
how
is
the
drinkability
its
pretty
damn
good
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
and
drink
many
with
the
abv
that
is
probably
around
five
i
couldnt
find
the
exact
number
but
ive
seen
5
2
around
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
i
will
be
purchasing
another
six
pack
pours
golden
blonde
and
very
clear
deeper
in
color
than
your
typical
american
lager
beer
aroma
is
just
bursting
with
mellow
floral
grassy
hop
aromas
typical
of
the
noble
variety
flavor
is
classic
dry
euro
pils
with
a
lot
more
hop
flavor
than
usual
slightly
bready
slightly
yeasty
very
crisp
and
refreshing
the
only
downside
to
the
flavor
to
me
is
that
there
just
may
be
too
much
hops
in
the
flavor
i
love
ipas
and
hop
aroma
but
for
a
pils
i
like
the
hops
flavor
to
be
more
balanced
of
course
in
this
case
they
were
going
for
a
different
beer
that
showcased
the
noble
hops
and
i
applaud
the
effort
and
enjoy
the
beer
notes
this
quite
a
nice
pilsner
its
nice
to
see
this
style
of
lager
cheers
drinkability
very
nice
oh
if
only
all
these
socalled
pilsners
could
taste
as
good
my
only
quibble
is
the
serving
size
is
this
available
for
sale
in
a
6pack
or
am
i
stuck
with
this
larger
bomber
bottle
size
sometimes
all
i
really
want
is
twelve
ounces
no
really
drinkability
a
great
pilsner
and
another
winner
from
boston
beer
company
once
again
sam
adams
produces
a
beer
that
is
a
great
representative
of
the
style
and
exceedingly
drinkable
a
mustdrink
that
completely
makes
up
for
the
scandal
which
is
sam
adams
coastal
wheat
di
usually
do
not
drink
this
style
but
after
all
the
good
reviews
i
made
the
trip
across
the
border
and
was
quite
pleased
and
would
buy
again
mad
props
to
boston
beer
company
on
this
one
i
never
thought
i
would
say
that
i
absolutely
love
one
of
their
beers
but
this
one
is
the
shizzle
d
a
highly
drinkable
thats
full
of
flavor
and
goes
down
smooth
i
will
be
buying
this
again
will
rereview
with
the
next
beer
from
6pack
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
multiple
times
in
a
sitting
the
hops
get
a
little
lost
after
a
while
of
sipping
but
the
beer
stays
refreshing
and
bright
edit

i
had
this
again
a
couple
days
ago
and
my
notes
were
pretty
similar
but
my
numbers
were
a
bit
lower
we
didnt
have
25
increments
when
i
did
my
original
review
so
i
adjusted
the
scores
still
a
solid
beer
worth
your
time
medium
body
maybe
lacks
the
carbonation
of
the
greats
of
the
style
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
enjoyable
im
glad
i
did
not
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
and
only
grabbed
a
single
this
was
not
somthing
i
could
have
more
then
one
of
glad
i
tried
it
but
one
was
enough
not
my
thing
i
found
this
to
be
surprisingly
full
of
flavor
this
is
not
the
one
dimensional
beer
i
had
expected
very
drinkable
mmm
nice
crisp
with
a
nice
biscuity
bready
malt
character
and
herbal
grassy
hops
that
leave
a
nice
distinct
drying
finish
d
its
a
very
easy
drinker
and
a
great
choice
for
an
early
spring
beer
i
think
the
freshness
of
this
beer
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
nod
over
some
of
the
imports
that
lose
something
during
their
trip
across
the
pond
it
really
makes
me
look
forward
to
a
full
thaw
warmer
weather
and
new
green
growth
while
i
did
enjoy
the
sams
white
this
is
a
nice
change
for
a
spring
seasonal
d
this
is
nice
addition
to
the
sams
seasonal
beers
lineup
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
light
pale
golden
color
there
was
about
a
finger
to
a
finger
and
a
half
of
pristine
white
head
the
smell
was
that
of
light
malts
seemed
similar
to
the
boston
lager
with
some
notes
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
was
very
straightforward
it
was
very
similar
to
the
aroma
it
was
a
crisp
light
malt
flavor
up
front
followed
by
some
nice
hops
notes
toward
the
middle
to
finish
of
the
sip
overall
a
nice
session
beer
i
was
not
overly
impressed
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
nice
to
see
these
in
12packs
i
will
probably
pick
up
some
more
once
it
starts
to
warm
up
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
not
my
favorite
sams
product
i
actually
liked
their
old
spring
brew
better
samuel
adams
noble
pils
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
i
dont
get
much
aroma
the
flavor
is
hoppy
some
grassy
notes
and
some
lemon
or
citrus
like
notes
but
i
just
dont
really
care
for
it
i
guess
i
prefer
american
style
hops
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
d
very
drinkable
kudos
to
sam
adams
on
this
brew
this
is
a
brew
that
a
brewery
the
size
of
boston
can
do
because
i
imagine
getting
the
variety
of
hops
was
not
easy
nice
deep
yet
clear
hay
color
with
modest
bubbling
and
an
ok
head
great
fresh
cut
grass
and
earthy
hay
and
grain
aroma
the
taste
starts
with
your
traditional
pilsner
hop
profile
and
dried
out
hay
and
lightly
toasted
cereal
grains
then
the
middle
has
a
supper
grass
and
earth
hop
flavor
with
a
crsip
bitterness
that
lingers
after
the
swallow
more
bitterness
than
your
standard
czech
or
german
pilsner
but
the
extra
bitterness
makes
it
more
drinkable
in
my
opinion
very
nice
maybe
it
is
just
because
ive
been
drinking
so
many
porters
and
ipas
lately
but
this
beer
just
hits
the
spot
a
nice
change
of
pace
light
refreshing
and
just
hoppy
enough
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
head
retention
and
less
of
a
fizzy
mouthfeel
but
other
than
those
minor
complaints
this
beer
is
excellent
a
great
pils
from
bottle
to
pilsener
flute
glass
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
sizeable
white
head
mostly
diminishing
good
lacing
sustains
through
finish
aroma
is
refreshing
with
citrus
honey
pine
hops
wellbalanced
with
great
taste
and
a
good
malt
presence
in
the
dry
finish
a
very
good
offering
by
sam
adams
and
would
definitely
buy
again
cheers
the
beer
went
down
very
smoothly
had
a
finish
similar
to
a
pale
ale
that
was
not
apparent
until
the
end
of
the
taste
smelled
very
hoppy
which
would
seem
natural
since
noble
hops
are
part
of
the
trademark
for
this
beer
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
from
a
renound
brewer
d
very
sessionable
but
also
a
bit
boring
i
enjoy
what
is
there
but
something
is
missing
smell
was
grainy
and
citrusy
with
grassy
and
herbal
notes
the
taste
was
fairly
heavy
on
the
palate
and
semi
dry
it
had
a
nice
lingering
effect
of
hops
on
the
tongue
crisp
and
a
little
creamy
nice
mouthfeel
this
would
taste
great
with
a
few
slices
of
pizza
overall
an
enjoyable
drink
and
would
buy
again
overall
meh
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
in
any
department
wish
the
hop
flavors
werent
so
lingering
d
very
drinkable
very
approachable
clearly
sam
adams
response
to
macro
perhaps
something
to
eventually
replace
sa
light
pours
out
a
fresh
golden
sun
color
with
a
small
head
but
a
long
lasting
ring
and
lacing
til
the
end
the
smell
is
great
i
can
smell
the
fresh
hops
i
smell
some
malts
and
flowers
and
herbs
the
taste
is
crisp
hop
forward
not
overwhelming
just
right
for
a
pils
it
has
a
nice
floral
aroma
and
taste
with
some
citrus
and
spice
and
then
finishes
with
a
german
bock
like
malt
to
me
this
is
a
winner
for
sam
adams
i
put
it
up
there
with
prima
and
budvar
its
highly
drinkable
and
recommended
d
my
dad
who
is
not
really
a
craft
drinker
but
has
moved
into
some
sam
adams
as
well
as
a
few
others
would
love
this
i
can
see
this
as
a
real
gateway
beer
into
craft
and
is
well
done
congrats
to
sam
adams
for
this
great
beer
this
is
my
favorite
beer
at
this
very
moment
in
time
its
drinkablity
is
off
the
charts
for
me
this
one
falls
somewhere
between
the
crownedking
of
lagers
right
now
the
prima
and
stoudts
perfectly
balanced
pils
which
is
saying
alot
very
well
done
sa
still
the
profile
is
very
good
nicely
bitter
all
the
way
through
dryer
and
heavier
than
your
average
german
pils
very
nice
clear
goldenflax
color
with
an
ice
white
sudsy
head
with
good
lacing
settles
in
a
few
minutes
a
quick
sniff
reveals
steely
malt
sense
but
a
swirl
releases
a
light
crisp
hoppy
note
the
smooth
but
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
allows
the
wellbalanced
taste
of
hops
to
come
across
with
full
flavor
but
definitely
not
overwhelming
might
be
the
perfect
hopped
up
brew
for
nonhopheads
sourness
that
dissipates
fairly
fast
will
keep
this
drinkable
and
sessionable
for
many
rather
light
to
me
but
i
like
having
the
taste
of
hops
without
the
oiliness
and
sense
of
camphor
every
once
in
a
while
recommended
another
excellent
sa
brew
pale
gold
with
an
averageish
amount
of
head
a
little
bit
of
lace
but
not
much
very
herbal
sulfurinfused
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
loads
of
damp
earthy
leafy
hop
characteristic
and
an
underpinning
of
sulfur
theres
a
restrained
citrus
zest
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
very
refreshing
with
a
nice
carbonation
overall
fans
of
pils
should
enjoy
this
one
a
lot
the
noble
hops
are
unmistakable
and
offer
a
pretty
complex
flavor
profile
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
food
pairing
option
with
some
fish
or
a
salad
or
something
or
just
a
great
lawnmowersummer
day
beer
recommended
d
an
incredibly
smooth
and
sessionable
brew
comments
a
very
inoffensive
brew
theres
nothing
bad
to
say
however
it
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
in
any
way
either
it
would
go
well
with
a
hamburger
or
pizza
a
nice
pleasant
everyday
drink
drinkability
perfect
level
of
alcohol
makes
this
one
hell
of
an
easy
drinker
great
session
beer
and
its
going
to
make
its
way
into
my
fridge
for
a
while
everyone
should
have
this
on
hand
d
very
easy
to
session
this
beer
the
only
thing
hurting
it
is
the
price
is
high
for
what
it
is
had
a
big
glass
of
this
while
waiting
on
a
table
at
a
local
bbq
restaurant
the
appearance
was
an
exceptional
golden
color
and
crystal
clear
aroma
was
a
little
on
the
weak
side
for
a
pils
but
then
i
like
pilsner
urquell
so
maybe
not
taste
was
semi
sweet
with
nice
hop
spiciness
up
front
and
a
long
piney
finish
the
hoppiness
while
being
very
much
a
part
of
this
beer
was
not
overly
aggressive
for
those
who
find
pilsner
urquell
or
some
of
the
german
pils
overly
aggressive
on
hops
this
would
be
a
more
approachable
one
very
smooth
very
drinkable
i
would
rate
this
right
up
there
with
some
of
germanys
better
pils
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
excellent
retention
and
laceing
aroma
is
of
piney
hopswith
some
hints
of
bready
malts
body
is
lightcarbonated
and
crisp
taste
is
a
malty
sweetness
balanced
by
a
hoppy
piney
finish
this
beer
is
light
but
full
of
flavor
great
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
wonderful
golden
color
that
was
nearly
transparent
with
a
crisp
white
head
that
left
a
14
cap
on
the
brew
this
is
a
clean
crisp
looking
brew
the
initial
aroma
is
of
spruce
and
citrus
some
slight
bitterness
fights
through
the
taste
is
clean
and
has
a
slight
citrus
front
with
the
spruce
and
mild
bitterness
dominating
the
finish
light
body
moderate
carbonation
this
is
once
again
a
solid
brew
from
sa
nice
work
mr
koch
overall
a
very
very
solid
and
very
drinkable
offering
totally
exceeded
my
expectations
are
there
really
people
giving
this
beer
an
a
grade
amazing
d
this
is
refreshing
tasty
and
well
balanced
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
great
job
of
an
innovative
beer
which
also
stays
true
to
the
style
a
big
grassy
tickle
of
hops
with
a
cereal
malt
base
thats
much
more
obvious
in
the
taste
of
it
the
hops
are
nice
bit
a
little
sharp
and
somehow
they
dont
taste
so
fresh
but
its
still
not
bad
still
not
prima
pils
but
good
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
sam
adams
line
not
true
for
all
of
their
beers
im
predominantly
an
aleipa
type
of
person
where
sam
concentrates
alot
of
effort
on
the
lager
family
i
much
prefer
their
imperial
hallertau
pils
to
this
one
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
for
any
pils
fan
but
the
hallertau
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
sam
line
of
beers
drinkability
a
nice
hoppy
pils
that
is
very
true
to
the
style
the
grassy
hoppy
taste
is
spot
on
a
welcome
replacement
for
the
white
ale
i
could
have
several
maybe
not
a
six
though
drinkability
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
especially
if
it
were
warmer
weather
released
in
january
an
odd
release
time
for
light
lager
overall
this
beer
blew
me
away
this
is
my
first
review
of
the
german
pilsner
style
so
im
assuming
this
is
one
of
the
best
or
ive
been
missing
out
completely
looks
good
smells
wonderful
and
tastes
even
better
the
texture
of
the
beer
and
the
finish
really
set
it
apart
though
glad
they
ditched
the
white
ale
as
the
spring
seasonal
too
i
didnt
like
it
near
as
much
as
this
one
its
easy
to
see
why
this
beer
is
getting
a
fair
amount
of
hype
clean
looks
great
aroma
sharp
hopfused
flavor
and
great
drinkability
make
it
a
solid
allaround
german
pilsener
better
than
i
expected
a
little
more
head
retention
and
a
little
more
balance
away
from
the
hops
would
be
truer
to
the
style
but
i
really
enjoy
this
new
offering
from
sa
i
could
drink
these
all
day
simple
but
full
of
flavor
it
is
a
change
of
pace
for
me
to
enjoy
a
beer
of
this
style
i
have
been
missing
out
whether
it
would
be
several
through
out
the
day
or
one
in
the
evening
noble
pils
is
a
winner
d
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
a
little
more
hop
than
most
of
the
big
names
in
the
style
but
i
think
it
is
wellbalanced
and
works
it
makes
it
unique
a
great
spring
choice
i
think
very
enjoyable
d
very
high
extremely
high
had
it
on
tap
at
the
local
outback
steakhouse
apparently
sam
wants
to
replace
their
white
ale
this
beer
has
a
very
clean
bright
appearance
the
head
was
full
and
lacy
nice
slightly
piney
nose
clean
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
what
a
nice
beer
for
a
pilsner
d
this
is
superduperdrinkable
im
not
kidding
around
this
i
one
of
the
most
sinkable
and
balanced
brews
that
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
its
light
crisp
and
vibrant
enough
to
be
a
megasession
brew
at
any
time
of
year
but
its
hoppy
flavorful
and
interesting
enough
to
really
grab
your
full
attention
should
you
stop
gulping
and
start
swirling
and
sniffing
hard
to
do
with
this
one
outstanding
one
of
my
favorite
new
releases
from
a
brewery
that
imo
keeps
getting
better
and
better
and
has
really
upped
its
cred
in
the
craft
brew
world
in
the
last
coupla
years
instantly
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
sam
adams
i
cant
pick
up
my
next
case
soon
enough
for
me
personally
i
dont
particularly
care
for
the
style
and
this
brew
is
not
an
exception
however
ill
be
unbiased
and
recommend
it
for
fans
of
lagers
kolsch
pils
and
lighter
german
biers
not
a
pils
fan
but
here
we
go
the
appearance
is
what
i
expected
however
a
little
bit
more
golden
brown
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
smell
is
much
better
than
i
thought
with
a
nice
citrus
smell
to
it
however
the
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
however
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
without
getting
hammered
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
german
pils
style
but
this
is
a
great
beer
and
props
to
sam
on
this
new
seasonal
overall
an
excellent
pils
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
i
can
see
this
being
my
spring
session
beer
nice
job
boston
beer
co
this
is
an
ok
session
beer
but
after
having
there
imperial
pilsener
offering
i
expected
this
to
be
a
much
smaller
version
for
the
masses
i
was
wrong
it
was
a
weak
overpriced
german
pilsener
with
little
to
no
hop
presence
not
terrible
not
good
an
average
pilsner
reach
for
sam
adams
hallertau
imperial
pilsner
for
a
better
beer
the
spring
seasonals
are
coming
out
earlier
and
earlier
each
year
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
a
light
lemony
color
with
a
nice
formed
bone
white
head
that
left
half
rings
of
broken
lace
as
it
settled
pretty
quickly
a
mix
of
sharp
herbal
hop
and
toasted
grain
in
the
nosejust
a
tinge
of
lemon
peel
the
hops
are
the
main
component
on
the
palate
but
they
are
well
rounded
in
there
different
flavorsleafylemonyand
sharpflavors
go
along
with
a
firm
toasty
base
this
is
just
as
drinkable
as
you
can
get
i
think
along
with
being
food
friendly
drinkability
while
its
not
bad
its
not
particularly
good
either
its
something
i
could
have
again
but
not
all
the
time
i
really
hope
they
make
this
one
of
their
regular
beers
and
not
just
a
seasonal
i
would
really
like
to
drink
this
in
the
summer
after
some
yard
work
pours
a
very
nice
golden
color
with
excellent
head
and
some
nice
lacing
great
scent
a
very
crisp
and
sweet
aroma
with
wonderful
hints
of
hops
in
the
nose
a
bit
of
citrus
and
spiciness
great
taste
one
of
my
favorite
pils
a
wonderful
malty
sweetness
starts
it
off
with
that
slightly
skunky
lager
hit
in
the
middle
finished
with
a
bright
hop
fizz
hints
of
spice
pepper
and
citrus
are
at
the
forefront
it
finishes
clean
for
such
a
hoppy
pils
while
keeping
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
serious
session
pilsner
very
tasty
and
a
great
addition
to
the
sa
family
of
beers
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
to
me
the
german
pilsner
character
isnt
pronounced
enough
the
dry
finish
is
good
and
the
aroma
has
some
noble
hop
character
but
i
think
that
the
malts
arent
clean
enough
and
just
dont
seem
to
fit
now
honestly
i
dont
think
primas
malts
are
spot
on
for
a
german
pils
but
the
beer
still
works
better
for
me
as
a
pils
versus
this
one
again
this
is
solid
beer
but
in
terms
of
pilsners
i
enjoy
prima
and
the
usual
pa
and
german
suspects
decidedly
more
i
would
have
had
trouble
immediately
distinguishing
this
beer
from
boston
lager
if
i
werent
told
what
it
was
sam
adams
noble
pils
was
great
im
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
on
tap
at
the
parish
publick
house
in
santa
cruz
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
displays
decent
but
not
great
retention
aroma
is
full
of
grains
pale
malt
and
spicy
noble
hops
flavor
is
great
as
far
as
pilseners
go
the
malt
base
is
largely
unsweet
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
cereal
but
mostly
straight
up
pils
malt
which
doesnt
even
try
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
hops
one
of
the
hoppiest
pilseners
ive
ever
had
really
vivid
grassy
and
spicy
character
with
a
very
faint
unripe
grapefruitlemon
citric
note
towards
the
end
its
got
an
appreciable
bitterness
that
unfortunately
comes
paired
with
some
astringency
on
the
tongue
with
a
more
inspired
aroma
and
a
crisper
cleaner
finish
this
could
be
world
class
but
as
it
is
its
just
really
good
and
a
welcome
addition
to
the
mostlymediocre
sam
adams
line
i
came
into
this
beer
with
good
expectations
i
usually
like
sam
adams
products
poured
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
minimal
head
smell
was
of
faint
hops
the
taste
was
muted
with
the
finish
falling
flat
i
wanted
more
complexity
and
it
just
wasnt
there
it
was
fairly
drinkable
and
probably
a
favorite
for
anyone
who
wants
a
mild
beer
that
is
relatively
easy
to
pound
overall
this
is
a
home
run
for
sa
complex
taste
in
a
pils
with
perfect
balance
and
great
drinkability
sa
would
do
well
to
keep
this
as
the
spring
offering
and
replace
the
less
than
stellar
white
ale
pours
a
light
golden
color
like
that
of
a
bud
light
with
a
small
bubbly
head
and
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
light
with
hints
of
grainy
hops
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
rather
hoppy
with
some
light
german
malts
and
a
pretty
yeasty
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
and
this
one
drinks
like
a
good
session
brew
i
actually
enjoyed
this
one
a
bit
better
out
of
the
bottle
but
a
pretty
tasty
beverage
from
sam
adams
drinkability
this
truly
has
drinkability
at
5
2
this
is
one
great
tasting
pilsner
i
usually
prefer
czech
pilseners
but
this
nobly
german
pilsener
truly
pleases
this
beer
advocate
i
would
highly
suggest
this
to
someone
looking
to
crossover
into
craft
regular
looking
lager
type
pale
gold
with
a
nice
frothythick
off
white
head
very
citrusy
aroma
mostly
lemon
something
else
cant
put
finger
on
ah
its
black
peppercorns
slightly
eathy
taste
is
also
peppery
with
smooth
honey
like
sweet
ness
hops
are
understated
mbut
get
a
nice
after
taste
ok
mouthfeel
nothing
stellar
overall
a
strange
pils
kinda
like
full
sails
attempt
last
year
good
but
hardly
near
a
classic
pils
i
liked
their
white
ale
but
adding
this
was
the
right
move
this
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
i
hope
it
sticks
around
for
the
summer
because
i
want
something
besides
wheat
beers
this
is
definitely
a
repeat
buy
for
me
especially
considering
what
this
will
cost
great
job
pours

3
or
4
sa
offerings
cant
help
but
compare
it
to
prima
pils
and
it
falls
a
little
short
but
is
still
a
solid
option
best
by
june
2010
im
choosing
this
lager
for
the
superbowl
d
i
think
this
may
be
one
of
my
new
favorite
sam
adams
beers
d
super
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
while
im
sad
to
see
their
old
spring
seasonal
go
white
ale
this
is
more
then
a
fine
replacement
drinkability
is
enourmous
i
really
like
it
it
has
a
complex
flavor
with
plenty
of
hop
character
very
crisp
and
satisfying
i
hope
it
becomes
one
of
sam
adams
year
round
brews
this
is
one
of
the
best
pilsners
i
have
had
in
a
while
definately
a
homerun
for
sam
adams
i
hope
this
becomes
a
year
round
offering
rather
than
a
seasonal
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
pilsner
since
victorys
prima
pils
i
could
drink
this
one
over
and
over
poured
a
straw
yellow
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
small
head
nose
is
big
dose
of
hpos
for
the
style
amd
smells
good
with
citrus
and
floral
notes
highlighting
the
nose
taste
is
fresh
and
crisp
upfront
with
hops
citrus
and
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
end
this
beer
is
clean
and
refrshing
i
am
very
impressed
so
much
that
i
had
4
of
these
bad
boysoutstanding
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
small
head
aroma
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
citrus
first
sip
is
a
crisp
hop
flavor
followed
by
a
nice
clean
bitterness
this
is
what
a
lot
of
american
pilsners
lack
it
has
that
nice
hit
of
bitter
that
keeps
the
beer
clean
and
fresh
super
drinkible
this
should
really
be
an
allyear
offering
from
sa
glad
they
chose
to
make
this
this
style
the
new
seasonal
this
is
another
hit
from
the
sam
adams
seasonal
series
i
know
ill
be
seeing
noble
pils
again
this
spring
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
it
on
tap
at
places
with
otherwise
unworthy
beer
selection
im
glad
this
beer
won
against
the
ipa
in
the
beer
lovers
choice
contest
i
didnt
need
another
below
average
ipa
to
choose
from
but
a
good
fresh
traditional
pilsner
is
appreciated
very
well
done
beer
here
may
not
please
all
the
hardcore
hopheads
but
they
will
have
to
agree
on
its
craftsmanship
did
i
mention
the
balance
great
beer
overall
and
easily
one
of
my
favorites
from
bbc
id
like
to
see
this
stick
around
as
a
yearround
offering
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
medium
fairly
persistent
dense
white
head
aroma
is
flowery
herbal
noble
hops
nice
pils
taste
light
malt
and
herbal
hops
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
balanced
but
maybe
just
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
smooth
pretty
full
bodied
for
a
pils
very
drinkable
and
very
good
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
from
bbc
drinkability
a
refreshing
pleasant
drinking
beer
that
lends
itself
to
having
another
and
another
i
would
put
it
up
against
many
of
its
highlyrated
cousins
victory
prima
pils
sly
fox
pikeland
pils
etc
a
must
try
for
those
who
are
tired
of
winter
and
ready
for
spring
a
nice
beer
in
my
pilsner
glass
it
was
a
golden
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
that
left
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
was
a
tad
meek
faint
citrus
kind
of
a
fresh
outdoorsy
aroma
ah
but
much
more
comes
through
in
the
taste
quite
hoppy
earthy
floral
notes
balanced
nicely
with
the
sweet
malt
a
crisp
bitter
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
drinkability
this
one
scores
reasonably
well
on
drinkability
because
i
could
easily
have
another
while
im
thinking
there
are
other
pils
style
beers
i
like
and
enjoy
more
this
one
has
its
place
as
a
beer
of
choice
for
an
evening
of
dining
and
good
conversation
with
friends
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
good
pilsener
ill
be
buying
more
now
and
again
the
boston
beer
co
really
knocks
one
out
of
the
park
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
one
of
those
beers
this
sucker
is
pretty
drinkable
and
overall
it
is
a
pretty
damn
good
pilsner
i
could
use
a
little
bit
more
malt
to
balance
things
out
but
this
beer
is
good
enough
the
way
it
is
that
im
not
complaining
too
much
quite
an
improvement
on
the
white
ale
a
good
light
hop
centric
beer
makes
me
think
of
a
nice
60
degree
spring
day
cant
wait
for
those
to
come
back
around
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
bring
a
6pack
of
this
to
a
function
or
share
one
with
a
friend
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
and
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
sam
adams
likely
due
to
the
freshness
factor
an
ideal
substitute
for
those
of
us
who
cant
enjoy
a
german
offering
without
the
transatlantic
voyage
it
is
still
less
refined
as
opposed
to
the
germans
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
there
definitely
needs
to
be
a
new
category
or
american
pilseners
which
are
always
fluffier
and
fruitier
than
their
precisely
engineered
german
cousins
really
impressed
with
this
sa
pours
a
bubbly
vibrant
straw
color
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
very
hoppy
aroma
and
taste
with
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
just
on
the
cusp
of
being
too
muchbut
actually
just
right
slightly
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
highly
recommend
sam
adams
has
a
pretty
nice
pilsner
here
the
limecitrus
peel
flavor
is
something
ive
never
tasted
in
a
pils
before
but
its
not
unwelcome
i
liked
the
white
ale
and
this
is
pretty
good
too
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
honey
color
perhaps
a
shade
darker
than
most
pils
the
head
is
pure
white
and
clinged
nicely
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
pepper
and
spicy
from
the
hops
there
is
dry
cracker
like
malt
scent
the
taste
has
a
citrus
zest
some
orange
honey
and
it
seems
like
they
added
lime
zest
this
is
followed
by
a
grassy
peppery
overall
spicy
noble
hop
flavor
which
adds
some
dry
bitterness
in
the
end
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
moderate
carbonation
starts
sweet
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
a
unique
pils
not
sure
i
am
totally
digging
the
lime
citrus
flavor
in
a
pils
but
it
is
not
cloying
or
artifical
it
has
good
typical
pils
characteristics
with
the
added
lime
like
zest
sam
adams
beers
vary
wider
than
almost
any
other
brewery
some
are
wretched
like
the
recent
blackberry
wit
this
one
is
very
wellmade
and
a
welcome
addition
crisp
and
moderately
carbonated
with
a
dry
finish
in
general
i
find
myself
being
underwhelmed
by
most
attempts
at
this
style
but
the
new
sa
offering
turned
out
to
be
fairly
good
an
easy
drinker
that
may
be
my
new
favorite
among
their
normal
seasonal
lineup
and
definitely
worlds
apart
from
the
white
ale
which
it
replaces
cheers
m
d
crisp
rather
dry
and
most
certainly
refreshing
its
wellcarbonated
which
makes
the
dryness
in
the
finish
even
more
enjoyable
on
my
palate
the
boston
beer
co
have
come
out
with
a
wellcrafted
brew
with
this
one
a
kind
homage
to
the
traditional
german
breweries
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
certainly
recommend
the
expiration
on
the
bottle
is
may
2010
sampled
on
january
22
2010
it
pours
a
nice
looking
goldenamber
with
decent
clarity
and
slow
going
carbonation
with
almost
no
head
of
any
kind
there
are
noticeable
hops
and
malts
in
the
aroma
and
they
seem
to
balance
each
other
out
with
the
same
level
of
strength
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
the
hops
are
more
noted
in
the
taste
than
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
bit
of
cereal
grains
and
light
malts
it
ends
dry
complex
but
enjoyable
without
a
doubt
sam
brews
like
a
champ
seeing
this
new
brew
i
picked
up
a
twelver
without
hesitation
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
a
delicious
smelling
fog
rises
out
of
the
bottle
smelling
of
malts
and
earthy
almost
pale
ale
type
hops
the
brew
pours
to
a
bright
yellow
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
stands
well
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
a
extreme
fresh
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
with
great
body
back
to
the
taste
it
is
slightly
bitter
but
sweet
not
balanced
but
plentiful
the
malts
and
hops
are
not
merged
but
are
both
present
this
is
the
best
pils
i
have
ever
dranken
bar
none
treally
incredible
offering
by
sams
this
is
what
a
pils
made
in
america
should
be
full
of
flavor
spot
on
d
i
have
enjoyed
more
than
one
of
sams
offerings
but
this
is
tops
on
my
list
there
are
some
truly
great
of
this
style
coming
out
of
the
northeast
the
sweetness
is
mild
the
hops
are
mild
the
aftertaste
is
mild
i
can
go
through
a
boatload
of
these
and
plan
to
this
is
a
great
pilsner
i
would
prefer
this
over
prima
pils
actually
this
one
is
more
balanced
prima
pils
struck
me
as
a
little
too
hop
foward
for
a
the
style
overall
a
solid
representation
of
this
classic
style
props
for
sam
adams
once
again
it
pours
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
gives
way
to
a
good
amount
of
lacing
with
its
clarity
and
somewhat
familiar
taste
i
think
its
a
great
beer
to
introduce
the
industrial
light
lager
drinker
to
the
better
side
of
beer
its
an
enjoyable
beer
interesting
taste
very
solid
choice
it
leaves
me
wanting
a
bit
more
i
could
appreciate
if
some
more
distinct
flavors
came
through
in
this
one
sam
adams
beers
always
have
a
way
of
making
me
think
their
beers
could
be
truly
incredible
this
is
indeed
a
good
pilsener
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
lagers
that
i
have
tried
in
a
while
recommended
i
say
give
it
a
try
i
dont
expect
youll
be
disappointed
drinkability
fantastic
pilsner
second
only
to
prima
pils
i
never
knew
that
a
pilsner
could
have
a
decent
amount
of
citrus
both
in
the
aroma
and
taste
this
beer
has
restored
my
faith
in
sam
adams
cheers
finally
saw
this
brew
at
the
store
so
i
picked
up
a
bomber
of
it
nice
looking
bottle
the
brew
poured
to
lighter
golden
color
with
a
good
sized
white
head
that
had
both
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
somewhat
complicated
as
i
am
picking
a
number
of
hop
scents
floral
herbal
and
a
slight
lemon
citrus
the
malts
come
through
as
well
and
mix
very
perfect
with
the
hops
and
i
wonder
if
that
is
why
i
am
getting
some
earthiness
from
the
aroma
as
well
the
flavors
well
i
really
did
not
think
that
they
could
live
up
to
the
aroma
but
they
do
and
then
some
a
very
fresh
clean
taste
hops
give
it
a
nice
bite
and
what
i
perceive
as
a
lemon
zest
i
notice
the
hops
the
most
but
they
are
in
no
way
dominate
as
i
am
picking
up
nice
bread
and
biscuit
flavor
which
mix
perfectly
well
nice
carbonation
on
this
one
perfect
accompaniment
to
everything
else
that
is
going
on
drinkability
on
this
one
is
through
the
roof
as
it
goes
down
so
easy
while
i
usually
feel
that
the
brews
from
sam
adams
are
fair
to
good
heck
they
where
a
gateway
to
good
beer
years
ago
for
me
this
one
is
simply
excellent
and
a
complete
surprise
i
know
that
this
is
a
spring
beer
but
this
would
be
the
perfect
session
brew
while
sitting
on
the
deck
in
summer
d
although
pilseners
are
far
from
my
favorite
style
this
is
really
a
solid
example
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
some
nice
clean
flavors
good
stuff
light
body
with
medium
caebonation
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
beers
yet
in
my
opinion
possibly
my
favorite
sometimes
i
wonder
why
self
proclaimed
hop
heads
chase
ipas
and
skip
beers
like
this
while
obviously
not
as
bitter
sometimes
a
good
pils
is
a
better
showcase
for
the
nuances
of
particular
hop
or
blend
of
hops
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
that
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
im
a
fan
of
a
lot
of
samuel
adams
beers
and
this
one
ranks
near
the
top
side
notes
im
not
huge
on
most
of
the
sam
adams
beers
but
this
one
really
stood
out
im
very
happy
with
what
they
did
here
jim
is
finally
taking
a
step
in
the
right
direction
cheers
each
sip
invites
the
next
to
come
quicker
than
the
one
before
bread
crust
and
saltine
crackers
are
crisp
on
the
palate
thanks
to
a
lively
carbonation
level
while
the
hops
kick
up
some
zest
across
the
sides
of
the
tongue
floral
grassy
and
green
with
a
semimusty
aftertaste
of
mineralrich
soil
packs
a
light
body
without
feeling
watereddown
in
the
slightest
german
pilseners
dont
get
much
better
than
this
noble
pils
is
an
exceedingly
solid
entry
into
the
boston
beer
company
portfolio
and
a
beer
that
comes
highly
recommended
by
yours
truly
this
might
be
my
next
beer
evangelism
tool
it
has
good
hop
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
nice
satisfying
beer
flavor
that
american
adjunct
lagers
pretend
to
hint
at
i
am
going
to
bring
this
to
gatherings
where
bmc
drinkers
abound
i
guess
i
have
a
bit
of
latent
resentment
for
all
the
years
of
drinking
macros
and
not
knowing
any
better
overall
one
of
sam
adams
best
only
behind
the
cream
stout
and
maybe
the
black
lager
for
my
favorite
great
crossover
appeal
i
actually
prefer
this
to
prima
pils
the
beer
i
think
it
will
be
most
often
compared
to
also
makes
for
a
great
seasonal
brew
highly
recommended
nice
looking
beer
very
clear
on
the
pour
with
a
decent
head
smells
of
a
multiblend
of
hops
grapefruity
but
not
overwhelming
very
clean
finish
with
very
little
aftertaste
smooth
and
refreshing
medium
bodied
and
flower
scented
a
great
summerspring
beer
that
is
highly
sessionable
d
very
well
made
brew
im
usually
not
that
fond
of
pils
but
this
is
a
welcome
change
d
a
very
cleanlooking
and
cleantasting
beer
as
well
this
pilsner
has
extremely
high
drinkability
and
is
a
great
starter
beer
for
the
evening
or
an
option
to
put
several
back
on
a
hot
day

certainly
would
have
again
will
miss
the
white
ale
but
this
is
a
fine
substitute
d
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
extremely
sessionable
the
noble
hops
are
excellent
and
when
you
take
price
into
account
this
may
edge
out
prima
pils
for
me
if
they
marketed
this
as
sam
adams
lime
i
would
believe
it
would
pass
as
such
kudos
for
having
a
lime
taste
without
the
actual
lime
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
like
a
sam
adams
lager
with
lime
i
could
drink
this
in
replacement
of
an
average
limesulfur
heavy
epl
d
not
a
favorite
of
mine
didnt
think
the
hops
were
well
balanced
possibly
added
to
the
wort
at
the
wrong
time
during
brewing
i
miss
the
white
ale
and
hope
sam
brings
it
back
next
spring
instead
of
noble
pils
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pils
glass
intense
carbonation
nice
sized
head
very
watery
looking
barely
any
color
i
could
see
my
hand
perfectly
through
the
other
side
of
the
glass
bit
of
hops
on
the
nose
but
not
much
taste
was
a
bit
more
of
a
redeeming
quality
very
crisp
and
clean
pilsner
flavor
very
light
mouthfeel
and
extremely
drinkable
if
you
like
pilsners
then
sa
has
made
a
winner
i
would
just
find
myself
bored
after
a
while
with
this
if
i
had
a
six
pack
in
the
fridge
i
liked
this
beer
better
out
of
the
bottle
rather
than
in
a
glass
in
a
glass
the
flavors
where
less
wellintegrated
the
hops
seemed
to
stand
a
part
from
a
somewhat
grainy
thin
malt
body
whereas
in
the
bottle
things
tasted
better
go
figure
sometimes
the
proper
way
isnt
the
best
way
d
very
drinkable
all
the
flavors
went
well
together
and
they
were
expertly
portioned
and
balanced
really
nice
beer
i
hope
they
continue
making
this
one
into
the
summer
great
summer
beer
drinks
very
well
light
and
refreshing
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
even
for
hop
enthusiasts
im
glad
that
a
lot
of
restaurants
carry
this
it
will
be
a
reliable
lunch
and
dinner
beer
amongst
other
less
enticing
options
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
ever
since
i
heard
about
its
release
its
a
light
golden
beer
with
a
light
grainy
malt
smell
with
a
whiff
of
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
both
light
and
crisp
with
just
enough
hops
not
a
hop
bomb
but
it
shouldnt
be
drinkability
is
fantastic
and
i
could
definitely
down
many
of
these
in
a
session
great
beer
overall
and
i
think
its
better
than
the
white
ale
was
the
appearance
golden
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
malty
with
a
nice
balance
but
the
aroma
is
weak
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
being
a
bit
citrusy
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
this
is
a
great
pils
with
plenty
of
hops
and
i
love
that
its
not
astringent
could
have
been
so
much
more
and
i
hope
they
come
back
next
spring
with
a
better
recipe
to
make
this
beer
great
d
it
definitely
catches
you
offguard
at
first
but
once
you
get
used
to
it
its
pretty
good
not
a
bad
drinker
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
light
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
wonderful
citrus
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pilsner
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
bitter
the
hop
character
is
very
nice
its
bitter
but
not
overly
done
what
a
refreshing
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
outstanding
pilsner
its
light
and
full
of
hop
character
quaffable
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
with
good
retention
smells
citrusy
off
the
bat
then
comes
the
herbal
notes
and
a
slight
grassiness
taste
is
highlighted
by
the
noble
hops
grassy
and
citrusy
with
an
almost
lemon
zestiness
to
it
accompanied
by
a
light
grainy
maltiness
to
balance
things
out
a
bit
very
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
light
and
carbonated
nicely
extremely
refreshing
and
sessionable
beyond
belief
the
drink
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
mild
fluffy
carbonation
that
fits
it
perfectly
noble
pils
is
supremely
quaffable
and
pretty
damned
delicious
excellent
d
i
have
always
felt
that
american
breweries
tend
to
do
a
poor
job
with
german
styles
and
this
brew
supports
my
generalization
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
a
good
one
either
and
certainly
not
to
style
there
are
a
few
other
good
examples
of
american
pilsners
out
there
and
i
would
recommend
seeking
them
out
instead
of
wasting
resources
on
this
one
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
im
very
impressed
with
this
release
a
very
good
pils
nice
and
fresh
im
pretty
excited
this
is
the
new
spring
seasonal
actually
ill
take
one
or
more
of
these
over
the
white
ale
any
day
drinks
easy
too
easy
i
think
the
only
thing
i
can
bitch
about
beer
is
that
it
was
released
during
the
wrong
time
of
year
i
would
slaughter
this
during
the
summer
but
more
than
likely
pass
it
up
while
the
weather
stays
cold
a
very
pleasant
surprise
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
incredible
everything
just
works
together
beautifully
not
as
dry
and
crisp
as
a
traditional
pilsner
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
interpretation
probably
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
sam
adams
and
definitely
top
5
american
pils
a
must
try
also
its
worth
mentioning
that
i
had
the
chance
to
cast
my
vote
on
this
or
the
samuel
adams
ale
at
the
barrington
beer
fest
for
which
would
win
and
go
into
production
i
voted
for
the
ale
easy
drinking
pils
very
balanced
and
refreshing
while
still
having
enough
flavor
and
body
to
make
it
interesting
great
job
sam
adams
samuel
adams
noble
pils
is
a
crystal
clear
sparkling
golden
lager
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
it
has
a
very
fruity
aroma
thats
bright
and
lemony
it
smells
a
touch
sweet
and
a
little
doughy
its
mediumlight
bodied
lively
with
a
crisp
finish
it
has
a
nice
fruity
wooden
flavor
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
bitterness
and
a
lemony
aftertaste
its
flavorful
and
refreshing

a
good
beer
but
since
it
is
a
spring
seasonal
i
am
not
sure
why
it
is
out
in
january
of
course
we
are
starting
to
see
oktoberfest
beers
come
out
in
july
so
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
still
there
is
something
wrong
about
drinking
a
spring
seasonal
on
january
15
d
hugely
drinkable
why
this
is
seasonal
ill
never
know
great
stuff
drinkability
i
had
no
problem
with
the
white
ale
but
i
think
this
is
better
and
id
be
more
apt
to
buy
this
than
the
former
hopefully
i
can
review
a
bottle
later
at
the
proper
temperature
but
a
solid
and
sessionable
and
tasty
domestic
pils
overall
this
has
excellent
drinkability
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
sam
adams
offering
out
there
it
has
flavor
depth
and
is
refreshing
to
drink
just
in
time
for
the
playoffs
well
done
d
i
could
drink
this
on
any
occation
due
to
the
fresh
hop
pressence
and
excellent
flavor
of
malts
it
pack
nice
i
enjoyed
this
pilsner
as
it
was
a
good
representation
of
style
and
would
gladly
order
it
over
other
bmc
adjunct
lagers
hope
this
becomes
a
regular
occurrence
in
the
sam
adams
repertoire
nice
carbonation
to
the
beer
with
a
body
that
is
fairly
light
but
not
overly
so
for
the
style
overall
great
drinkability
the
success
of
this
one
in
the
voting
led
it
to
replace
the
white
ale
as
the
spring
seasonal
hopefully
success
there
leads
to
this
becoming
a
yearround
brew
or
at
least
a
spring
and
summer
seasonal
d
i
would
put
this
on
the
lower
end
of
pils
drinkability
due
to
its
aggressive
nature
not
a
clean
smooth
refresher
abv
is
manageable
not
to
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
would
look
for
in
this
style
there
may
be
another
lager
style
where
this
beer
fits
more
appropriately
smells
of
grass
and
hops
has
a
distinctive
citrus
and
fresh
taste
but
not
too
crisp
i
thought
the
hops
variety
is
great
do
i
taste
some
honey
very
nicely
done
for
spring
or
anytime
a
great
have
another
beer
easy
to
have
several
of
these
well
done
as
advertised
reminds
me
of
spring

nearly
an

of

hops
come
through
right
away
in
the
aroma
with
hints
of
toffee
biscuit
and

spicy
noble

share
the
flavor
almost
equally
with
bready

with
touches
of
dms
cooked
vegetable
toast
and
butter
very
light
bodied
with
ample
though
not
overwhelming
carbonation
pair
with
the
light
body
to
aid
the
drinkability
greatly
not
a
bad
pils
ive
definitely
had
better
examples
of
the
style
to
me
this
falls
somewhere
between
the
bohemian
and
bavarian
ends
of
the
spectrum
but
this
grows
on
me
an
easy
drinking
spring
seasonal
glad
this
replaced
the
white
and
glad
another
widely
available
pilsener
is
out
there
tastes
clean
and
fresh
with
sparkling
hoppiness
on
warm
toasty
malt
bed
hops
are
floral
mainly
with
secondary
flavors
of
spicy

fruitiness
from

is

moderately
stiff
hop
bitterness

with

good
drinkability
you
want
a
small
abv
beer
with
big
flavor
one
thats
accessible
and
affordable
and
made
presumably
with
love
give
noble
pils
a
try
in
fact
give
it
a
few
triesbuy
it
in
a
6pack
and
stretch
it
out
over
a
week
that
was
the
way
i
realized
this
was
a
truly
great
beer
having
initially
found
it
onedimensional
it
definitely
is
not
and
i
couldnt
think
of
a
better
every
day
beer
than
this
one
overall
this
will
be
a
great
beer
when
its
late
spring
and
nice
and
warm
outside
but
by
that
time
summer
ale
will
probably
be
among
us
meh
d
dangerously
drinkable
a
thirst
quenching
brew
that
makes
me
thirst
for
more
with
every
sip
what
happened
to
my
12pack
kidding
i
only
had
a
22
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
sam
adams
not
at
the
top
of
its
class
in
any
one
area
but
taken
as
a
whole
everything
works
well
together
a
beer
one
could
easily
sit
down
and
drink
more
than
a
few
a
very
drinkable
beer
poured
light
golden
with
a
12
inch
quickly
disapating
head
very
earthlike
pilsner
smell
great
taste
and
even
better
aftertaste
easily
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
offerings
definately
recommended
im
adding
this
sentence
to
meet
the
250
character
requirement
drinkability
finally
a
nice
lager
that
assecceable
because
we
dont
have
prima
just
yet
in
the
market
overall
i
prefer
prima
but
this
a
great
beer
its
more
balanced
than
prima
and
has
way
less
hops
though
finally
a
spring
seasonal
that
is
worth
looking
foward
to
sam
adams
has
really
hit
the
spot
with
this
one
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
a
pilsner
and
if
i
remember
right
they
never
tasted
as
good
as
this
one
did
after
drinking
heavy
winter
beers
the
last
few
months
it
took
me
until
my
second
bottle
to
really
appreciate
the
great
flavors
crisp
hops
and
flavors
of
lime
or
is
it
lemon
on
touch
the
front
of
my
mouth
and
the
color
after
pouring
it
in
a
glass
everyone
will
want
it
so
you
may
want
to
hide
them
from
friends
at
first
after
the
snow
melts
i
will
defintely
be
looking
foward
to
having
a
drink
of
this
on
the
lawn
and
starting
the
bbq
for
the
first
time
d
the
best
thing
to
come
from
bbc
in
a
long
time
and
perhaps
my
favorite
offering
from
them
ever
if
this
exact
recipe
could
be
produced
year
round
it
would
be
a
dream
come
true
and
if
any
american
brewery
could
kick
the
shit
out
of
every
german
pils
ive
ever
tasted
i
could
have
guessed
it
would
be
sam
adams
this
stuff
just
begs
to
be
consumed
this
is
one
incredibly
good
and
drinkable
beer
d
very
refreshing
nice
and
clean
a
golden
straw

with
a

finger
faomy

good
retention

is
of
a
solid

background
with
a
mixture
of
spicy

lightly
sweet

spicy
with
a
clean

a
crisp
clean

i
only
bought
one
of
these
but
i
would
deem
it
sessionable
i
could
see
drinking
several
of
these
at
one
sitting
a
smooth
enjoyable
beer
thanks
sam
the
body
is
a
taut
lightish
medium
with
steadfast
nonuppity
carbonation
even
on
a
frigid
night
this
rockets
itself
down
the
throat
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
new
seasonal
sam
adams
has
put
out
in
a
while
but
early
spring
is
a
weird
slot
for
this
it
needs
to
be
around
and
fresh
in
the
warmer
months
or
better
yet
yearround
flavor
is
light
grain
and
bread
followed
by
some
spicy
floral
hoppyness
finish
is
clean
and
lightly
bitter
after
a
side
by
side
comparison
with
victory
prima
pils
ill
have
to
say
that
victory
still
holds
the
crown
for
best
us
germanstyle
pilsner
but
noble
pils
definitely
sits
right
up
in
the
top
3
without
a
doubt
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
over
drinkable
in
fact
the
6
abv
never
lets
itself
known
till
youve
had
a
few
or
5
this
is
an
incredible
ger
pilsner
from
the
boys
at
sa
i
hope
they
put
this
one
out
all
the
time
pretty
solid
atmosphere
appearance
is
really
average
but
the
nose
is
really
full
floral
and
unique
very
nice
combo
of
tones
flavor
is
not
too
complex
but
bitter
and
sharp
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
and
kind
of
a
grassy
tone
to
finish
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
edit
i
had
this
on
tap
at
outback
the
first
round
from
the
first
keg
of
np
they
had
and
i
noticed
it
had
more
sourness
to
it
i
frankly
think
that
it
tasted
better
from
the
bottle
but
that
might
have
to
with
the
keg
being
just
tapped
and
the
glass
just
pulled
out
of
the
fridge
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
as
others
have
noted
this
one
is
more
for
a
warm
springsummer
day
than
the
midwinter
ill
most
likely
pick
up
a
six
pack
once
the
weather
turns
nicer
to
enjoy
as
an
everyday
beer
golden
straw
body
nice
offwhite
foamy
head
banana
peel
and
grainy
pilsnermunich
malts
in
the
nose
with
light
citrus
and
floral
hop
notes
the
taste
has
more
banana
peel
mild
spices
and
a
nice
noble
hop
character
in
the
back
with
a
lemony
grassy
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
refreshing
sparkling
even
and
a
definite
german
feel
overall
very
well
done
a
pilsner
without
the
cheap
malt
flavor
overall
a
decent
beer
my
biggest
gripe
is
in
the
flavor
profile
everything
for
a
pilsener
is
there
but
it
just
comes
off
a
tad
weaker
than
i
expect
from
a
craft
brewer
definetly
worth
a
shot
but
dont
expect
one
of
the
best
pilseners
around
found
this
at
my
local
kroger
was
really
suprised
to
see
this
brew
so
soon
pours
golden
clear
with
a
nice
head
this
is
their
best
seasonal
brew
hands
down
very
drinkable
brew
sa
does
it
again
glad
i
bought
2
cases
and
will
buy
more
before
theyre
gone
a
lighter
bodied
beer
very
carbonated
almost
effervescent
in
nature
drinkable
are
you
kidding
me
i
could
sure
go
for
a
couple
more
overall
an
exceptional
addition
to
the
sam
adams
lineup
just
wish
it
didnt
say
seasonal
on
the
six
pack
i
can
see
this
being
amazing
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
to
medium
in
body
soft
and
round
with
a
hint
of
dryness
a
very
tasty
well
done
pils
finally
a
sam
adams
beer
i
can
really
get
behind
im
quite
impressed
noble
pils
is
a
good
spring
beer
from
sam
adams
and
could
easily
lead
me
to
try
and
appreciate
more
of
the
style
d
i
found
this
quite
drinkable
but
rather
dull
it
looks
great
but
the
flavor
seems
too
light
even
for
a
light
style
like
this
seems
like
a
nice
candidate
as
a
summer
refresher
however
perhaps
my
opinion
would
improve
on
a
warm
summer
day
vs
the
cold
winter
night
i
drank
it
on
conclusion
i
picked
up
a
12pack
of
this
at
hyvee
today
as
it
was
a
great
price
12
bucks
and
it
had
nothing
but
rave
reviews
i
have
to
say
its
not
quite
what
i
expected
i
dont
love
it
nor
do
i
hate
it
im
honestly
not
quite
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
the
intense
and
herbal
hoppiness
is
nice
but
somehow
for
me
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
dont
quite
come
together
to
make
the
light
crisp
clean
pilsener
i
was
expecting
the
hops
arent
overpowering
im
an
ipa
fan
after
all
but
they
just
seem
a
bit
rough
to
me
especially
in
a
style
thats
generally
so
smooth
d
after
being
on
a
huge
dipaipa
kick
lately
its
refreshing
in
so
many
ways
that
i
could
drop
back
to
a
beer
that
had
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
satisfy
that
craving
but
not
the
heaviness
or
the
boozy
alcohol
content
that
leave
me
burpy
and
tired
quite
possibly
sams
best
very
good
beer
di
could
session
this
forever
i
cant
wait
till
it
comes
out
in
6
packs
in
the
spring
i
love
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
spun
gold
color
the
head
is
an
inch
and
a
half
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
spicy
noble
hops
moderate
bitterness
and
assertive
bready
malt
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
the
hops
are
sharp
but
the
malt
is
strong
enough
to
balance
everything
out
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
german
pilseners
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
this
beer
replacing
sam
adams
white
ale
as
their
spring
seasonal
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
things
to
happen
to
craft
beer
in
the
last
decade
i
will
certainly
be
drinking
this
by
the
case
load
edit
over
a
year
after
this
brew
was
originally
released
i
find
myself
continuing
to
come
back
to
it
it
really
is
a
great
session
option
that
goes
down
easy
really
solid
overall
as
noted
before
a
nice
break
from
the
heavier
more
traditional
seasonal
beers
complex
enough
to
offer
some
interest
without
veering
from
style
too
far
nicely
done
edit
i
had
to
go
back
and
raise
my
score
on
this
after
trying
it
again
a
few
days
later
this
beer
is
great
drinkability
is
inspiring
if
you
feel
bored
with
the
craft
beer
scene
and
how
things
have
been
driven
toward
rarity
and
high
alcohol
with
insane
doses
of
malts
and
hops
then
you
need
to
reach
for
the
noble
pils
from
sam
adams
to
take
you
back
to
a
flavor
that
made
you
fall
in
love
with
beer
thanks
keith
for
pointing
this
out
to
me
excellent
i
will
be
enjoying
many
more
of
these
in
the
upcoming
days
weeks
months
i
think
you
get
the
picture
stbc
would
not
recommend
o
i
find
this
style
refreshing
and
a
good
one
to
revisit
from
time
to
time
good
representation
here
and
i
would
try
it
again
nothing
to
scream
about
but
just
a
solid
well
made
beer
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
refreshing
beer
even
for
a
czech
pils
the
flavor
is
still
a
bit
thin
in
particular
i
expect
a
bit
more
malt
complexity
which
this
is
lacking
still
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
wont
get
this
again
just
not
that
good
id
choose
it
over
millerbudetc
but
not
over
any
other
southern
tier
products
not
bad
a
little
weak
for
my
liking
but
would
certainly
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
solid
german
pilsner
from
and
american
brewer
overall
decent
beer
o
this
beer
has
done
little
to
convince
me
that
american
craft
brewers
handle
european
lagers
well
compared
to
many
of
the
czech
classics
this
lager
is
sorely
lacking
everything
about
it
is
just
a
little
off
although
it
is
not
bad
really
the
aromas
and
flavors
displayed
by
this
beer
are
too
simple
and
too
straightforward
and
the
carbonation
is
far
too
forceful
there
is
not
a
lot
of
depth
complexity
or
subtlety
here
and
the
whole
package
is
a
bit
too
unrefined
for
my
liking
again
it
is
not
really
that
bad
but
it
does
seem
a
bit
dumbed
down
compared
to
the
beers
it
tries
to
emulate
hardly
anything
extraordinary
a
mundane
pils
that
slights
the
style
a
bit
drinks
fine
but
its
passable

rjt
owould
be
a
great
summer
beer
perfect
for
grilling
and
mowing
the
lawn
several
could
go
down
easily
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
liked
this
more
than
i
expected
and
lets
be
honest
the
name
is
pretty
cool
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
the
toasted
biscuit
malt
character
with
a
clean
crisp
hop
finale
the
taste
is
a
slight
improvement
over
the
nose
but
it
is
generally
pretty
average
oh
well
today
got
up
to
55
degrees
so
it
hit
the
spot
mouth
was
fairly
bland
thin
and
drinkable
a
good
summer
beer
if
we
can
ditch
the
skunk
better
than
most
light
beers
o
easy
drinking
pils
nothing
special
but
nothing
offensive
just
think
this
would
be
a
better
beer
for
summer
time
drinking
overall
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
but
ive
had
better

very
tasty
session
brew
hits
the
palate
very
nice
and
tastes
great
with
a
good
aftertaste
overall
i
enjoyed
wish
the
weather
was
warmer
and
im
sure
id
enjoy
it
even
more
this
beer
is
all
right
no
thrills
as
one
would
normally
expect
for
the
style
and
eurotrash
is
no
exception
o
not
a
bad
pilsener
sans
the
aftertaste
the
taste
isnt
bad
at
all
but
the
aftertaste
isnt
pleseant
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
kind
of
bland
i
know
its
a
lager
but
they
can
still
be
full
of
flavor
this
one
isnt
id
drink
again
but
wouldnt
buy
again
this
is
an
easy
relaxing
lawnmower
beer
but
not
very
exciting
drinks
easy
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
i
actually
thought
this
was
better
ice
cold
but
reviewing
at
proper
serving
temperature
i
liked
this
pilsner
from
southern
tier
its
difficult
to
review
pilsners
as
they
are
not
overly
complex
and
by
nature
dont
get
high
scores
this
is
a
quality
addition
to
the
genre
just
a
taste
weak
overall
not
one
of
the
better
beers
from
stbc
and
overall
it
was
not
as
refreshing
and
flavorful
as
i
would
have
liked

a

aroma
my
first
thought
was
good
german
beer
taste
was
bright
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
lingering
bittterness
at
the
finish
was
a

light
on

though
a
good
example
of
the
style
poured
from

12

into

nice
foamy
head

not
especially
thick
nice
golden

with

in

most
grassy

nose
enjoyable
easy
drinking
beer
quite
sessionable
yet
nothing
extraordinary
slightly
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
but
could
be
much
better
if
the
hops
were
a
little
bigger
true
to
type
but
seems
more
like
a
pu
of
today
than
the
old
beloved
style
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
its
your
basic
czech
pilsner
scent
pilsner
malts
and
czech
hops
its
light
and
crisp
with
a
refreshing
character
to
it
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
again
its
easy
drinking
with
not
a
ton
of
character
it
light
and
quaffable
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
european
pilsner
its
true
to
character
and
highly
drinkable
o
i
dont
really
have
anything
negative
to
say
about
this
offering
but
there
isnt
much
good
to
say
either
o
a
solid
americanstyle
czech
pils
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
that
borders
on
being
sessionable
a
nice
spring
seasonal
overall
a
decently
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
brew
nothing
too
flavorful
or
special
but
good
for
what
it
is
meant
for
a
somewhat
crisper
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
brew
to
drink
while
sitting
and
conversing
with
friends
o
merely
an
average
pilsner
the
vegetal
character
really
hurts
it
not
bad
but
there
are
much
better
lagers
out
there
drinkable
beer
im
going
straight
from
the
bottle
so
i
cant
tell
you
what
it
looks
like
smells
like
a
euro
pilsner
very
clean
one
too
tastes
clean
and
crisp
and
a
mild
sweetness
of
malt
with
a
nice
little
hop
flowering
feels
a
bit
dusty
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
respectable
clean
session
worthy
brew
cant
say
i
really
love
the
whole
name
and
labeling
going
on
trash
doesnt
make
me
want
to
drink
makes
me
want
to
shower
i
guess
this
brew
showers
your
mouth
very
good
pilsner
here
nice
amount
of
bittering
hops
mellow
yeast
and
a
sweet
and
soft
malt
base
a
bright
and
refreshing
beer
eh
this
is
drinkable
but
hardly
impressive
or
worth
a
repeat
attempt
hayward
abbey
rating
77
overall
a
good
thirst
quencher
but
somewhat
lacking
for
a
pilsner
doesnt
stand
up
well
to
many
of
its
european
counterparts
eurotrash
pilz
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
tiny
head
overall
this
was
a
pretty
surprising
beer
from
southern
tier
the
aroma
is
light
with
noble
hops
and
light
malts
the
taste
has
a
light
dose
of
noble
hops
over
a
light
malt
base
a
wet
dog
sensation
comes
through
halfway
in
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
macrostyled
beer
so
its
almost
novel
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
the
drinkability
is
great
its
a
pretty
much
pitch
perfect
take
on
the
euro
lager
style
but
more
drinkable
and
flavorful
i
like
it
d
this
is
a
reasonable
example
of
the
style
though
it
is
lacking
some
of
the
intensity
of
the
better
european
examples
the
hops
are
present
but
a
bit
subdued
and
the
pilsner
malt
character
never
quite
comes
out
in
its
full
glory
nevertheless
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
better
than
the
average
eurostyle
lager
o
perfect
for
this
sunny
mid80s
day
a
decent
take
on
the
style
but
just
a
tad
imbalanced
towards
hops
this
is
a
really
decent
pilsner
something
light
refreshing
and
genuinely
flavorful
it
poured
a
nice
bright
straw
yellow
colored
body
with
a
very
little
fizzy
head
that
quickly
vanished
the
smell
is
and
citrusy
with
some
hop
notes
the
taste
is
crisp
with
some
nice
citrus
notes
and
is
well
balanced
with
the
malt
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
dry
but
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
overall
not
a
huge
flavor
here
but
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
the
only
thing
bad
about
this
thing
is
the
name
the
beer
is
quite
good
though
i
think
it
drinks
more
towards
a
kolsch
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
day
and
its
supposed
to
reach
97
degrees
today
as
i
stated
above
its
not
a
flavor
bomb
but
pilsners
arent
supposed
to
be
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again

suprisingly
hefty
for

maybe
a

much
decent

although
not
best
to
style
i
got
a

of
rocky

head
from
my
aggro
pour
which
evidenced
low
retention
due
to
the
humidity
of
the
day
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
lots
of
carbonation
in
evidence
this
sissy
was
looking
forward
to
this
fizzy
yellow
beer
ya
heard
greg
koch
nose
had
a
very
pleasant
lemoncitrusiness
and
my
mouth
was
watering
at
the
prospect
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
all
of
the
carbonation
had
led
me
to
expect
but
the
taste
was
like
a
lemon
tartmuffinbiscuit
as
the
hops
really
interacted
well
with
the
malt
in
the
mouth
finish
was
semidry
and
not
just
refreshing
but
welcomed
in
the
increasing
humidity
of
this
summer
afternoon
quite
good
and
worth
having
again
o
clean
and
crisp
with
great
drinkability
done
well
to
style
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
body
soft
carbonation
kind
of
dulls
it
down
but
its
easily
drinkable
and
the
flavors
work
well
together
finish
is
sweet
dry
biscuit
o
overall
not
very
tasty
a
bit
of
funky
moldy
hops
low
carbonation
and
unclean
malt
profile
leaves
much
to
be
desired
a
shame
because
i
usually
like
a
lot
of
southern
tiers
beers
just
goes
to
show
you
the
real
craftmenship
is
in
brewing
the
lighter
bodied
beers
where
flaws
cannot
hide
blah
not
even
close
i
enjoyed
this
czech
pilsner
from
southern
tier
quite
a
bit
ill
definitely
have
more
this
summer
o
a
pleasant
but
not
earthshattering
pils
i
much
prefer
victory
prima
pils
this
ones
right
in
the
wheelhouse
nothing
too
spectacular
about
it
but
solid
without
any
real
flaws
pours
a
nice
clear
light
gold
with
lots
of
visible
carbonation
medium

smell
is
big
herbal
and
floral
noble
hops
lots
of

sharp

bitterness
in

middle
good
herbal

flavors
theres
a
momentary
a
cakelike
sweetness
in
the
finish
before
fading
to
a
lingering
sharp
bitterness
pretty
full
bodied
for
a
pils
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
for
its
style
and
im
not
sure
what
else
you
want
from
a
czech
style
pils
i
was
actually
drinking
heineken
the
night
before
at
a
party
so
the
taste
was
fresh
in
my
mind
kind
of
what
put
me
in
the
mood
again
this
is
not
a
bigass
victory
ipa
or
dales
pale
ale
and
its
not
supposed
to
be
is
it
as
good
as
pilsner
urquell
i
cant
say
as
i
havent
had
one
in
a
long
time
but
its
as
good
or
better
than
heineken
and
tastes
great
with
burgers
on
the
grill
husky
and
grainy
nose
with
restrained
floral
and
spicy
hops
in
the
background
an
oddly
boozy
beer
at
such
a
modest
abv
but
the
alcohol
does
seem
to
accentuate
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
lingering
semisweet
doughiness
a
thicker
than
necessary
body
and
booze
this
beer
is
anything
but
light
and
refreshing
rough
around
the
edges
almost
like
a
malt
liquor
or
a
euro
strong
lager
its
interesting
but
im
glad
i
only
have
a
single
to
deal
with
instead
of
a
sixer
southern

eurotrash

is
a
super
clear
pale
golden
lager
with

quickly

bubbly
film
theres
not
much
aroma
it
smells
a
little
sweet
grainy
and
maybe
lemony
its
very
light
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
it
tastes
a
little
sweet
up
front
then
a
sort
of
chemical
taste
comes
in
with
a
little
bitterness
toward
the
finish
yeah
i
think
this
was
appropriately
named
theres
not
much
going
on
here
i
find
myself
drinking
it
faster
to
wash

aftertaste
out
of
my
mouth
poured
into

is
incredibly
pale

a
thin
layer

lacing

nose

grassy
hops
typical
of
a
pilsener
with
vague
hints
at
skunk
character
sweet
corn
notes
come
through
along
with
some
grainy
quality
as
well
the
taste
is
absent
of
the
hop
character
that
i
detected
on
the
nose
lots
of
malt
character
with
a
tinge
of
corn
sweetness
not
a
lot
of
flavor
here
the
mouthfeel
is
feather
light
with
high
carbonation
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
pils
the
nose
is
a
bit
off
putting
and
the
malt
character
is
a
little
too
sweet

the
style

this
is
a
really
nice
to
the

i
was
afraid
they
were
going

kill
this
with
high

no
this
is
just
what
it
says
it
is
and
done

stuff
nice
pilsner

the
flavor
was
just
a
little
off
so
it
fell
well
short
of
the
great
czech
pils
overall
an
easy
going
summer
beer
was
better
on
tap
but
i
chalk
that
up
to
the
bottle
being
a
little
old
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
pilsner
or
is
seeking
an
alternative
to
the
macro
brews
out
there
the
flavor
is
a
bit
off
for
a
pils
it
has
some
unwanted
yeasty
notes
and
too
much
candied
orange
misuse
of
noble
hops
the
taste
is
very
mild
with
malt
up
front
and
light
hop
spice
there
is
a
gentle
pilsner
malt
flavor
under
the
slight
acidic
bite
of
the
moderately
high
carbonation
level
the
mild
touch
of
sweetness
is
pleasant
with
light
bitterness
and
floral
hop
flavor
recurring
the
crackerlike
dry
edge
of
the
yeast
and
toasted
malt
is
appealing
overall
a
good
pilsner
i
would
enjoy
this
at
a
cookout
or
with
some
barbecue
anytime
a
refreshing
and
quaffable
brew
with
very
minimal
off
flavors
highly
drinkable
and
good
seems
like
an
ok
beer
for
a
hot
day
i
like
this
pilsener
a
lot
and
will
buy
again

i
have
had
much
better

still
love
st
though
serving

its
as
light
as
id
expect
though
a
far
cry
from
the
thin
feel
of
some
efforts
pretty
well
verging
into
medium
its
got
a
constant
crispness
as
well
as
carbonation
and
its
clean
overall
an
above
average
no
frills
pilsner
that
leans
slightly
to
the
bitter
side
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
will
revisit
soon
overall
i
am
impressed
with
the
quality
of
this
czech
pils
i
willbe
buying
it
again
too
bad
its
a
seasonal
though
the
flavor
is
an
improvement
mostly
from
the
strong
hop
bitterness
theres
a
grainygrassy
base
to
the
taste
relatively
rich
body
particularly
for
the
style
this
is
brewed
to
style
so
theres
really
no
surprises
its
smooth
flavorful
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
to
have
around
as
the
weather
warms
a
nice
czech
pils
wanted
something
a
little
lighter
and
it
delivered
not
complex
but
nice
and
crisp
pours
light
yellow
with
a
finger
of
fine
white
foam
and
plenty
of
resonance
pretty
beer
earthy
hops
with
a
slight
but
subtle
sweetness
in
the
malts
simply
nose
nothing
special
flavor
is
bitter
with
a
dry
crispy
grain
flavor
body
is
thin
even
for
the
style
with
reserved
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
overall
this
would
be
an
average
pilsner
imo
a
little
too
bitter
with
a
shy
grain
character
and
a
little
hard
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
easydrinking
light
beer
and
a
decent
pilsner
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
there
are
flavor
flaws
here
past
which
i
just
cant
get
good
looking
clear
pale
straw
color
but
this
beer
cant
seem
to
hold
onto
its
head
very
well
and
certainly
doesnt
leave
any
behind
as
lace
noble
hops
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
on
the
nose
smell
reminds
me
of
big
green
bottle
euro
beers
and
while
it
is
a
scent
i
personally
dont
mind
it
still
isnt
really
what
i
want
or
expect
out
of
what
should
by
all
accounts
be
a
fresh
pils
hop
bitterness
is
there
for
taste
and
thats
great
but
what
this
beer
really
needs
is
to
dry
out
on
the
finish
it
is
tasty
but
too
sweet
for
what
it
is
it
is
fine
through
the
mouthfeel
in
a
sort
of
ohhellodidntnoticeyou
kind
of
way
it
isnt
thin
or
undercarbornated
or
viscous
or
anything
but
it
doesnt
really
perk
up
the
tongue
like
some
pilseners
ive
had
all
in
all
this
is
a
tasty
drinkable
refreshing
beer
but
it
does
more
to
stand
behind
than
in
front
of
comparable
brews
not
bad
but
not
great
has
some
flaws
but
the
overall
balance
keeps
this
as
an
average
beer
if
someone
gave
me
a
six
id
work
my
way
through
it
before
to
long
and
be
grateful
but
as
it
stands
im
not
about
to
go
get
myself
this
beer
again
overall
a
decent
pilsner
with
plenty
of
flavor
yet
light
for
a
hot
day
enjoy
12oz

reminds
me
of
a

summer
day
for
some
reason
lawnmower

perhaps
tastes
are
a
little
bland
with
piilnser
malt
grain
sour
grape
and
apple
juice
with
a
hop
bite
on
the
finish
that
is
a
little
harsh
with
some
metallic
notes
lingering
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
but
carbonation
is
appropriate
overall
im
not
wowed
by
this
one
at
all
pretty
average
for
the
style
hence
the
3s
across
the
board
the
palate
opens
with
a
rather
metallic
character
along
with
sulfur
and
a
definite
plsaticymedicinal
character
chlorophenols
fermentation
too
warm
there
is
some
hop
flavor
and
some
malt
flavor
as
well
but
the
flaws
here
really
get
in
the
way
of
my
evaluating
them
fairly
neutral
malts
with
a
mild
earthy
bitterness
and
a
nice
hop
flavor
this
actually
has
a
nice
rounded
hop
character
the
flaws
though
ruin
it
on
the
bright
side
some
of
the
off
flavors
do
dissipate
as
i
let
the
beer
sit
but
this
isnt
a
style
that
should
require
decanting
carbonation
is
high
probably
appropriately
enough
but
i
doubt
my
drain
is
going
to
care
if
it
werent

an

this
beer
scores
an
a
for
drinkability
and
has
plenty
of
flavor
as
well
o
the
beer
is
crisp
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
as
there
are
better
pilsners
out
there
it
has
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
the
other
southern
tier
brews
this
seems
to
give
it
a
little
unique
character
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
simple
but
good
pils
tasty
and
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
but
i
just
bought
a
single
pours
a
nice
golde
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
and
not
laceing
aroma
is
of
bready
malts
and
grassy
hops
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
malty
with
a
nice
tang
to
the
finish
decent
version
of
the
style
but
the
are
better
out
there
still
very
worth
a
try
o
not
exactly
a
supercomplex
brew
but
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
which
reminds
me
this
is
not
a
czech
pilsener
neither
in
appearance
nor
in
flavor
but
much
more
like
a
german
pils
nowhere
on
the
bottle
or
in
the
description
posted
on
the
southern
tier
web
sight
does
it
say
this
is
a
czech
style
pilsener
o
a
decent
pilsner
but
nothing
far
and
away
better
than
most
craft
pilsners
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
1
12
finger
head
smells
of
egg
yolk
boiled
corn
water
buttery
malts
and
faint
hops
extremely
grainy
on
the
taste
all
corn
water
this
is
not
what
i
expected
at
all
light
in
body
and
feel
overall
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
it
tastes
like
a
budwieser
with
a
little
more
of
a
buttery
feel
save
your
cash
and
buy
a
case
of
genny
for
the
same
price
of
a
6r
of
this
this
beer
was
terrible
from
start
to
finish
o
what
a
change
up
from
the
cold
weather
certainly
this
isnt
the
prima
of
pils
it
was
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
the
head
is
a
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
vaguely
malty
with
very
faint
bread
and
caramel
but
it
is
mostly
air
the
taste
is
a
lot
fuller
than
the
aroma
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
bready
malt
with
and
spicy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
pilsensers
out
there
this
is
good
beer
i
wouold
suggest
slight
more
carbonation
with
minimizing
the
diacetyl
to
a
more
of
a
trace
mostly
adding
the
bitting
hops
a
bit
earlier
would
milded
them
out
to
help
with
the
transition
from
the
malt
better
perfect
clarity
on
this
pale
straw
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
moderate
activity
on
this
one
smells
of
simple
pilsen
malt
and
noble
hops
grainy
taste
with
a
noble
leafy
taste
on
the
exhalation
really
good
beer
really
easy
to
drink
my
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
its
a
winter
seasonal
and
not
a
summer
seasonal
overalli
was
reluctant
to
buy
this
beer
due
to
the
fact
that
i
am
not
crazy
about
pilsners
southern
tier
is
basically
in
my
back
yard
and
i
have
been
to
there
brewery
several
times
and
generally
like
the
beers
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
for
a
pilsner
this
is
pretty
good
it
tastes
a
lot
better
than
the
average
mass
produced
american
pilsner
you
would
get
and
i
have
to
admit
i
liked
it
better
than
some
of
the
european
pilsners
i
see
this
as
there
go
to
beer
for
someone
that
comes
to
the
brewery
or
in
the
market
for
that
manner
and
saysah
i
dont
really
like
dark
beers
do
you
have
anything
i
might
like
good
beer
for
the
non
craft
obsessed
masses
eurotrash
pilz
pours
into
the
glass
a
straw
yellow
shade
with
a
hint
of
light
gold
towards
the
edge
barely
a
cap
to
speak
of
no
lace
smell
is
straight
up
pilsner
malt
very
bold
as
this
bottle
is
only
a
month
out
besides
some
grassy
scents
nothing
else
to
sniff
taste
is
a
bold
c
pilsner
assertive
with
pilsner
malt
and
minimal
hop
evasion
very
light
earthy
arraingement
under
the
pilsner
malt
finishes
very
clean
and
the
body
is
light
carb
is
kinda
lacking
in
this
department
not
as
crisp
as
actual
german
styles
clean
tasting
beer
though
glad
i
found
this
fresh
drinkable
for
one
or
two
but
why
would
southern
tier
put
this
out
as
a
seasonal
in
the
dead
of
winter
it
does
stand
out
from
everything
else
on
the
shelf
this
time
of
year
and
eurotrash
will
be
able
to
avoid
the
rat
race
of
100
different
pilsners
on
the
shelf
in
summertime
hopefully
this
sells
good
thing
it
has
been
a
mild
one
thus
far
bottle
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
white
head
clean
aroma
of
a
slightly
floral
hop
with
some
notes
of
wheaty
bread
lightmedium
mouthfeel
slightly
weet
start
with
a
floral
hop
that
adds
some
nice
bitterness
components
drinkable
started
off
like
a
wet
fart
but
picked
it
up
somewhat
with
the
flavor
and
feel
not
bad
but
nothing
above
average
notes
light
to
moderate
in
body
with
a
very
clean
mouthfeel
quite
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
offering
for
the
summer
i
dont
know
why
this
one
hit
our
shelves
in
early
january
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
a
good
lager
and
its
dated
right
on
the
bottle
more
craft
breweries
should
take
notice
of
the
quality
and
date
coding
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
nice
break
in
the
winter
months
o
a
good
pils
and
drinkable
but
there
are
many
better
than
this
that
i
would
buy
first

ultra
but
we
both
agreed
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
and
we
look
forward
to
having
it
out
on
the
market
pours
a
clear
light
straw
small
white
head
forms
and
recedes
to
nothing
no
lace
light
aroma
grainy
mostly
with
a
hint
of
flowery
noble
hops
in
the
flavor
more
grainy
flavor
pale
malt
very
mild
bitterness
and
almost
no
hop
profile
mouthfeel
is
good
crisp
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
grainy
bite
overall
this
is
a
very
average
pils
overall
a
tasty
summer
selection
a
nice
run
at
the
style
growler
from
village
beer
merchant
terrribly
named
this
was
a
great
summer
beer
and
kept
its
carbonation
overnight
excellent
drinakbility
i
was
able
to
finish
80
of
it
myself
and
it
went
well
with
a
weekend
of
meals
generous
retained
head
a
nice
moderate
bitterness
smooth
mouthfeel
really
good
for
what
it
is
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
just
like
the
name
just
like
a
euro
pils
in
the
taste
a
small
saaz
hop
and
a
clean
standard
pils
taste
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
and
clean
aftertaste
a
clean
european
pils
nothing
exciting
but
clean
and
fresh
great
session
beer
a
growler
is
an
easy
kill
if
your
into
pilsners
drink
this
if
you
can
get
it
drinkability
is
damn
good
on
this
one
and
lovely
to
throw
back
love
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
decent
its
an
easy
drinking
lighter
beer
it
was
consistent
with
the
style
but
not
something
that
really
stood
out
within
the
style
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
to
it
that
really
stands
out
it
served
its
purpose
on
this
hot
day
though
d
very
good
goes
down
easy
and
the
flavors
arent
overwhelming
could
use
a
touch
more
crispness
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
d
this
one
was
just
not
quite
there
for
me
it
did
get
better
as
the
pint
went
on
but
it
was
just
a
touch
off
it
was
an
easy
drinker
but
the
nose
really
did
hurt
it
a
little
bit
o
very
nice
sharp
corners
on
a
true
old
world
style
in
that
it
isnt
overly
americanized
the
sweetness
is
not
full
on
bread
malt
but
the
grassy
hop
bite
is
also
restrained
nicely
so
its
really
solid
live
oak
is
becoming
worldcraftbeerwide
famous
for
its
hefeweizen
but
this
pils
is
no
slouch
at
all
fantastic
beer
ill
dispense
with
formal
descriptions
of
the
perfect
colored
hay
this
is
really
is
an
outstanding
pilsner
perfect
for
the
horrible
heat
in
austin
great
hops
smooth
with
no
drops
or
interruptions
to
the
grassy
undertones
it
is
worth
chasing
down
really
this
is
quite
easy
drinking
before
i
know
it
the
beer
is
gone
this
is
an
awesome
pilsener
that
i
would
love
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
might
even
be
better
than
hefeweizen
from
the
same
brewery
though
i
would
need
to
be
in
right
mood
to
consume
this
beer
though
i
dont
see
that
of
being
much
of
an
issue
this
is
excellent
imagine
if
this
was
your
first
exposure
to
a
pilsner
and
then
you
tried
the
bmc
versions
of
it
instead
for
me
at
least
my
experience
has
been
the
opposite
drinking
the
fizzy
swill
then
finding
out
that
beer
has
flavor
more
more
more
please
taste
shows
plenty
of
bitterness
not
an
abundance
of
hop
flavor
and
it
does
have
a
decent
malt
backing
its
kind
of
an
earthy
pilsner
with
the
malts
not
just
grainy
and
all
tworow
nice
and
fresh
with
a
full
body
good
brew
one
of
the
best
pilsners
in
texas
growler
shared
at
the
july
santa
cruz
tasting
pours
clear
light
gold
with
a
puffy
white
head
pale
malts
and
a
light
saaz
hoppiness
in
the
nose
flavor
is
fresh
grains
with
a
crackery
finish
and
a
substantial
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
finish
dry
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
great
interpretation
of
a
german
style
pils
in
fact
better
than
many
of
the
german
pils
ive
had
in
the
past
in
germany
its
clean
and
refreshing
and
perfect
for
the
summer
easily
in
my
top
two
for
the
style
the
beer
is
light
orange
with
12
head
and
lasting
retention
the
aroma
is
really
nice
bringing
a
healthy
dose
of
pils
malt
the
flavor
is
malt
forward
and
lacks
the
noble
hop
presence
of
a
beer
like
prima
pils
i
actually
prefer
less
of
a
hop
presence
finish
in
a
pilsener
the
carbonation
level
is
spot
on
the
growler
packaging
job
was
superb
and
this
was
fresh
tasting
and
full
of
zesty
carbonation
the
finish
was
quite
dry
which
i
rather
liked
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
i
am
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
i
would
certainly
enjoy
having
it
again
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
pils
from
live
oak
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
pilseners
beer
is
thin
bright
and
wet
with
an
oddly
bitter
finish
the
bitterness
tastes
like
it
comes
from
some
noble
hop
variety
but
it
is
hard
to
pin
down
the
overall
beer
is
quite
good
very
refreshing
and
a
great
pilsner
id
have
it
again
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
average
spotty
lacing
the
nose
carries
a
heavy
malt
presence
comprised
of
straw
and
grain
also
some
light
herbal
and
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
quite
grainy
and
strawlike
without
much
hop
presence
theres
also
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
light
bitterness
on
a
light
body
with
average
carbonation
somewhatdry
finish
a
solid
beer
but
a
bit
too
grainy
and
not
complex
enough
for
my
tastes
would
like
to
have
seen
a
bit
more
noble
hop
character
this
is
a
great
casual
drinking
beer
and
another
victory
for
live
oak
clear
gold
with
a
shirt
white
cap
nice
lacing
and
good
head
retention
intense
noble
hop
aroma
grassy
floral
and
spicy
with
a
little
bit
of
grainy
malt
in
the
background
solid
bitterness
from
start
to
finish
mild
cereal
sweetness
with
plen
more
floral
and
spicy
hop
character
it
had
more
body
than
i
expected
for
a
pils
a
little
more
richness
but
the
texture
was
smooth
and
carbonation
was
soft
making
for
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
see
it
becoming
a
staple
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
clear
gold
body
half
finger
white
head
full
pour
multiple
streams
of
lazy
rising
carbonation
classic
pilsener
nose
quite
floral
some
breadiness
and
noble
hops
not
much
sweetness
taste
mirrors
nose
though
once
again
not
very
sweet
medium
mouthfeel
clean
with
little
effervescence
drinkable
but
hardly
memorable
while
it
has
a
similar
grade
not
in
the
same
league
of
moonlight
or
victory
worth
a
try
however
on
tap
the
beer
is
a
clear
darkish
golden
color
with
a
white
sticky
head
pale
bready
malt
and
grassy
hops
emerge
from
the
aroma
a
dash
of
spice
is
mixed
in
the
flavors
are
similar
to
aroma
the
pale
malt
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
grassy
hops
at
the
end
the
beer
is
smooth
as
it
goes
down
and
very
thirst
quenching
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
a
good
domestic
take
on
a
bohemian
pilsner
though
not
in
the
same
league
as
moonlights
reality
czeck
for
example
ontap
at
the
gingerman
the
body
is
just
a
touch
thicker
than
most
of
the
czech
pilsners
but
this
lager
does
a
great
job
of
amplifying
the
nobel
hops
without
going
over
the
top
theres
a
tasty
lemonherb
hop
character
backed
by
mellow
white
bread
malt
to
make
this
both
satisfying
fourthbeer
potential
below
average
i
wasnt
quite
a
fan
of
this
one
but
i
guess
its
because
nonipa
bitter
beers
seem
a
little
off
to
me
still
a
decent
drinkable
brew
but
too
much
kick
relative
to
other
pilsners
d
a
little
strong
and
not
real
easy
to
drink
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
in
the
future
md
medium
light
body
exceptionally
drinkable
and
flavorful
excellent
pilsner
beer
on
tap
at
the
ginger
man
in
austin
slightly
cloudy
flavor
is
a
nice
combination
of
malt
hop
spice
and
the
mineral
flavors
i
enjoy
from
a
pilsner
highly
drinkable
i
could
definitely
enjoy
several
of
these
medium
bodied
with
a
smell
that
reminds
me
of
noble
hops
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
crisp
and
well
done
beverage
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
on
drinkability
a
great
example
of
a
czech
pilz
here
in
the
states
if
you
are
ready
to
graduate
to
a
fullflavored
beer
from
the
humdrum
american
macro
brews
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
i
know
the
live
oak
guys
really
pride
themselves
on
this
brew
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
pilsner
malt
with
some
spicy
hop
character
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
pilsner
malt
as
well
as
grassy
and
pepperyspicy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
pilsener
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
local
hype
but
its
still
a
good
beer
for
hot
texas
days
if
you
like
pilseners
its
worth
a
try
a
good
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite

with
excellent

mouthfeel

finish
was
light

satisfying
pilsner
as
pilsner
should
be
5s
this
was
on
mishap
of
the
bar
i
had
it
at
when
fresh
this
beer
is
quite
nice
crisp
with
a
good
refreshing
hop
not
as
hoppy
as
some
americans
and
not
as
floral
but
quite
a
nice
mint
grass
peppermint
crisp
and
a
poor
protein

malt
but
absolutely
not
in
the
foreground
to
the
malt
character
just
one
dimensional
finish
not
much
fruit
straw
bitter
hay
another
great
beer
from
live

and
an
awesome
pilz
a
near
perfect
example
of
a
lager
one
of
my
favorites
not
just
in
texas
but
anywhere
d
pretty
solid
session
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
have
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
from
now
on
d
very
much
so
this
if
you
are
into
such
a
thing
is
a
beer
worth
pounding
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
white
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
golden
brew
head
recedes
gradually
with
a
solid
coating
of
lace
aroma
is
spicy
hops
taste
is
pale
sweet
upfront
lots
of
spicy
saaz
in
the
middle
which
just
keeps
on
keeping
on
through
the
close
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
with
the
biting
hops
keeping
it
interesting
and
drinkability
is
great
go
find
some
you
wont
be
sorry
very
drinkable
and
definitely
a
session
beer
a
nice
pilsner
but
not
on
par
with
victory
prima
or
stoudts
very
good
this
live
oak
place
seems
like
quite
the
joint
ive
been
searching
high
and
low
lo
10
years
to
find
a
replacement
for
my
favorite
and
now
defunct
pils
and
ive
found
a
worthy
substitute
and
in
all
places
texas
id
written
off
anything
brewed
in
tejas
until
i
had
this
beer
heres
to
hoping
my
second
encounter
will
equal
the
first
truly
a
world
class
pilsener
bob
snob
from
washington
portland
wonderful
golden
yellow
colour
with
a
strong
head
thats
leaving
not
just
lacing
but
a
coat
of
head
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
bit
doughy
but
dont
let
that
deter
you
this
is
a
crisp
hoppy
refreshing
pilsener
good
body
and
carbonation
very
dry
bitter
finish
a
fine
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
colored
body
with
a
white
colored
head
lastingish
has
some
aroma
but
not
very
much
some
grain
maybe
its
hard
to
tell
bitter
taste
with
some
malt
watery
palate
a
quiet
shining
star
from
the
live
oak
brewery
had
this
pilsner
on
tap
at
live
oak
brewery
in
east
austin
served
in
a
plastic
pint
glass
has
a
golden
appearance
with
a
frothy
white
head
smells
like
hop
heaven
with
an
abundance
of
floral
notes
made
with
mostly
czech
ingredients
hops
from
bohemia
barley
from
moravia
this
is
as
czech
as
you
can
get
in
texas
hop
bitterness
up
front
balances
well
with
the
bready
finish
a
very
straightforward
lager
this
is
my
idea
of
a
czech
pilsner
slightly
malty
very
bitter
had
this
on
tap
at
opal
divines
in
austin
along
with
sunday
brunch
pours
almost
pure
gold
with
a
pure
white
head
had
a
very
thick
lacing
which
stayed
throughout
the
life
of
the
drink
tasted
of
big
hops
and
spice
with
a
perfect
unmistakable
pis
crispness
was
really
surprised
at
the
hop
bite
on
this
one
behind
all
of
that
there
was
some
grain
yeasts
spice
and
grass
the
lacing
was
thick
throughout
there
was
a
quick
burst
of
bubbles
on
a
shake
displaying
the
high
carbonation
of
the
beer
excellent
and
tasty
pils
and
like
no
other
ive
had
before
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
as
most
of
the
live
oak
offerings
tend
to
be
pretty
nice
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
on
tap
heavy
doughy
musty
yeasty
smelling
it
smells
strongly
of
mushy
yeast
and
dough
which
isnt
my
favorite
as
the
style
goes
but
still
okay
as
far
as
the
taste
it
is
a
lightly
bitter
bite
with
a
smooth
finish
i
didnt
find
this
refreshing
like
some
pilsners
but
rather
gooey
and
thicker
from
the
heavily
yeasty
smell
present
in
the
nose
and
also
somewhat
present
in
the
taste
if
you
like
heavy
yeast
flavor
this
is
a
great
pilsner
for
you
i
still
prefer
live
oaks
other
beers
to
this
id
say
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
but
really
good
d
good
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
eminently
drinkable
one
of
the
better
domestic
pilsners
i
have
tasted
not
as
big
and
bitter
as
victory
but
easier
to
drink
because
of
the
floral
elements
this
is
my
second
favorite
lo
beer
and
probably
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
of
all
time
better
than
any
bottled
import
ive
tried
not
as
hoppy
as
a
victory
prima
but
still
a
real
craft
beer
can
drink
this
stuff
like
it
was
made
from
water
hands
down
my
favorite
pilsner
while
i
am
a
fan
of
the
big
beers
this
is
the
pilsner
with
the
most
taste
ive
ever
had
has
some
that
green
bottle
skunky
taste
like
a
true
czech
pilsner
but
much
more
more
fresh
and
tasty
only
coming
from
a
few
miles
away

after

as
well

and

with

and

that
is

alcohol
is

with

after

overall
this
is
a
very
nice
czech
pilsener
style
all
around
good
robustness
and
balance
of
pale
malt
and
earthy
hop
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
average
to
slightly
below
average
hoppier
pilsner
the
earthy
hops
do
not
seem
to
mesh
well
with
the
pilsner
malt
decent
beach
beer
but
i
prefer
others
in
the
style
o
nothing
special
but
wow
is
it
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
so
something
right
was
done
here
still
its
far
from
my
favorite
pilsner
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
on
tap
at
mcgillins
this
past
weekend
light
golden
straw
color
with
a
smallish
bone
white
head
sweet
malty
bready
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
light
bready
honey
like
sweet
malty
taste
with
a
hint
of
tartness
to
it
decent
pilsner
but
not
nearly
as
refined
or
as
cleanly
fermented
as
some
classic
examples
the
resiny
hop
taste
is
quite
prominent
a
touch
of
the
metallic
and
stony
an
herbal
sort
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
this
seems
quite
sharp
and
tangy
with
a
lemon
peel
taste
not
as
quaffable
for
a
light
beer
as
you
might
like
though
it
has
plenty
of
hops
for
those
who
like
more
bite
from
the
12
oz
bottle
out
of
the
cooler
at
whole
foods
in
dc
quite
a
bit
of
tangy
tone
to
this
one
also
a
lot
of
ink
to
it
as
well
hoppy
spices
are
clogging
things
up
as
well
the
whole
combination
makes
it
much
more
robust
and
intense
than
i
would
like
for
a
lager
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
level
of
restraint
at
all
there
is
nothing
refreshing
about
this
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
seems
to
lack
flavor
feels
washed
out
o
dont
sleep
on
dominion
they
are
still
producing
some
excellent
brews
and
this
is
absolutely
one
of
them
great
recommendation
rhett
and
a
musttry
pilsner
for
anyone
living
in
a
city
that
gets
above
90
degrees
in
the
summer
i
think
itd
be
a
comedown
to
say
a
good
lawn

house
knocks
the
hops
out
of
pretty
much
any
imported
czech
pilsner
yeah
an
average
pils
literally
i
was
not
expecting
that
described
on
the
label
as
our
bohemian
pilsner
it
did
not
lack
for
saaz
hops
either
on
the
tongue
or
on
the
finish
i
was
left
gasping
for
air
more
please
sir
and
pass
the
pitcher
of
water
while
you
are
at
it
i
may
need
to
rehydrate
after
this
one
it
has
a
semibitter
taste
that
makes
it
taste
like
its
a
bread
but
that
is
due
to
the
hops
it
does
go
down
easily
and
its
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
d
this
one
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
while
barbqueueing
goes
down
easily
this
pilsner
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
big
ole
frumpy
white
head
that
instantly
grabbed
my
attention
bear
in
mind
that
i
scored
its
appearance
relative
to
that
of
other
pilsners
lightly
sweet
aromas
reminiscent
of
a
bin
of
ripe
lemons
the
taste
is
too
sweet
up
front
for
my
liking
and
im
grateful
for
the
lingering
bitter
finish
that
eventually
balances
it
out
overall
this
beer
is
not
a
bad
choice
and
would
make
a
welcome
companion
out
in
the
sunshine
apart
from
the
diacetyl
which
hopefully
is
a
single
batch
error
this
is
a
pretty
decent
czechstyle
pils
the
malt
is
at
the
right
level
bitterness
is
at
the
right
level
and
the
hop
flavors
are
at
the
right
level
a
little
bit
more
hops
in
the
nose
would
be
nice
but
ok
its
nicely
balanced
and
theres
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
beyond
one
nice
d
a
very
good
pilsner
w
fresh
hoppy
taste
and
a
crispquaffable
quality
i
enjoyed
this
lager
a
lot
dont
pass
it
up
d
i
hope
this
is
not
a
harbinger
of
the
kind
of
beers
the
new
dominion
lineup
is
going
to
consist
of
low
flavor
with
ad
gimmicks
thankfully
a
low
price
but
maybe
a
case
of
you
get
what
you
pay
for
here
an
okay
pilsner
and
i
prefer
the
ones
with
a
little
lighter
and
crisper
malt
flavor
the
hops
have
a
perfumelike
in
the
aroma
and
biting
in
the
flavor
which
i
think
is
the
better
half
of
the
beer
the
malts
need
a
little
work
drinkability
is
high
pretty
refreshing
beer
which
tastes
good
worth
having
a
couple
d
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
pilsner
another
wellbrewed
beer
from
dominion
this
stands
up
pretty
well
against
prima
pils
its
a
notch
below
to
be
sure
but
it
seems
to
be
cut
of
the
same
cloth
poured
a
medium
yellow
color
with
a
small
sized
white
head
aromas
of
grains
with
some
grassiness
tastes
of
the
same
graininess
grassy
and
verly
light
caramel
i
found
the
body
to
be
on
the
weaker
and
somewhat
watery
side
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
d
not
sure
of
the
alcohol
content
but
i
do
detect
the
alcohol
so
i
imagine
its
at
least
about
5
5
or
so
sure
it
could
be
found
if
someone
looked
hard
enough
a
pretty
good
beer
and
something
that
would
serve
well
as
a
sort
of
every
day
beer
of
sorts
intense
but
drinkable
fresh
yet
balanced
beers
like
this
one
dont
come
along
too
often
thats
why
i
was
so
disappointed
when
dominion
changed
their
spring
brew
style
from
the
awesome
double
pilsner
they
used
to
have
to
that
belgian
ale
they
currently
brew
for
the
spring
season
though
that
one
isnt
bad
however
i
think
dominion
has
more
than
made
amends
in
my
book
with
beach
house
the
drinkability
is
good
as
the
whole
of
this
brew
is
more
enjoyable
the
is
parts
prosit
mk
im
gonna
say
pass
on
this
beer
decent
brew
nothing
too
special
but
with
a
name
like
beach
house
it
fits
the
bill
am
i
really
the
first
one
to
review
this
bottled
on
4
7
08
they
say
they
used
perle
tettnanger
and
saaz
and
it
is
quite
a
noble
effort
by
dominion
indeed
bright
golden
with
a
white
head
that
holds
on
for
a
minute
or
two
and
doesnt
leave
tons
of
lace
but
looks
pretty
darn
attractive
the
beauty
of
fresh
beer
is
here
so
i
reccommend
getting
in
on
this
first
batch
while
the
getting
is
good
nice
floral
grassy
herbal
hop
scent
mixed
with
a
hint
of
sourdoughyish
bread
that
has
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
it
taste
is
similar
fairly
well
balanced
but
a
bit
of
pungent
dryness
comes
out
and
im
having
a
hard
time
describing
it
but
it
is
pleasant
and
lemony
and
kind
of
weird
and
medicinal
as
well
anyways
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
by
this
brewery
in
a
long
time
a
very
easy
refreshing
drink
that
ill
be
having
more
of
for
sure

mouthfeel
is

substantial
overall
a
very
good
bohemian
pilsner
o
nothing
outstanding
but
its
a
good
pilsener
one
of
the
more
unique
pilseners
ive
tried
considering
the
light
fruity
flavors
light
and
crisp
but
plenty
of
flavor
again
not
outstanding
but
a
good
pilsener
poured
this
czech
style
pilsener
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pilsener
poured
a
clear
golden
color
produced
an
average
white
head
and
featured
below
average
retention
and
left
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
off
fresh
baked
bread
and
grassy
hops
medium
in
body
this
pilsener
had
a
base
of
malted
husky
malted
grain
touch
of
lemon
citrus
white
pepper
and
bitter
hops
decent
example
of
a
czech
pilsener
i
believe
this
to
be
pretty
authentic
prost
o
this
one
is
clean
and
drinkable
nothing
special
but
not
bad
zatec
comes
up
short
when
compared
with
other
commercially
available
czech
pilsners
but
it
is
a
delicious
beer
that
i
have
bought
before
and
will
buy
again
nothing
to
write
home
about
more
or
less
a
session
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
better
than
american
macros
but
only
by
a
bit
not
bad
merely
average
overallgreat
sessionable
beer
for
anytime
great
with
any
type
of
food
the
czechs
know
what
they
are
doing
one
of
the
classic
czech
pilseners
pours
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
is
gone
instantly
smells
meadowy
floral
and
grassy
malt
driven
but
balanced
flavor
really
features
the
czech
malts
they
are
light
and
grainy
very
pleasant
in
all
seasons
some
mild
hops
on
the
finish
which
is
very
crisp
and
dry
as
can
be
mouthfeel
is
good
for
what
it
is
obviously
very
light
on
the
body
but
still
with
plenty
of
flavor
excellent
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
pils
exemplary
of
the
czech
style
and
usually
widely
available
at
a
reasonable
price
overall
this
is
what
a
beer
should
taste
like
this
is
clean
refreshing
and
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
amstel
light
it
tastes
like
beer
i
wish
this
was
available
in
12
packs
where
i
am
because
i
could
session
this
every
summer
weekend
highly
impressed
o
overall
i
think
this
is
an
old
bottle
i
certainly
didnt
have
a
gusher
on
the
first
one
i
tried
a
few
years
ago
i
would
have
never
been
looking
for
it
again
and
the
resiny
hop
character
is
not
very
smooth
no
freshness
dating
to
be
found
on
the
labels
i
dont
normally
drink
czech
pilsners
this
seems
like
a
really
good
example
of
one
this
is
a
far
better
option
than
pilsner
urquel
overall
much
better
than
expected
my
first
czech
pilsener
while
my
score
tends
to
say
this
isnt
anything
special
there
are
no
issues
either
i
tend
to
think
that
with
the
lighter
czech
beers
i
have
yet
to
have
a
beer
that
blows
the
others
away
ive
had
german
pale
beers
that
have
so
im
going
to
have
to
hunt
for
a
czech
one
kout
perhaps
out
of
a
bottle
this
czech
pilsner
was
a
clear
24k
gold
color
just
as
it
should
be
the
white
was
only
a
thin
layer
but
the
retention
was
good
and
the
lacing
in
fishnets
that
lasted
all
the
way
down
my
glass
the
aroma
was
of
saaz
hops
crystal
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
the
flavors
were
clean
and
crisp
though
not
overwhelming
i
tasted
the
pleasant
pilsner
malts
bready
grains
and
some
lemon
grass
and
herbal
notes
from
the
saaz
hops
nothing
was
big
about
this
beer
it
was
wellbalanced
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
slick
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
light
very
pleasant
albeit
nondistinct
d
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
low
abv
and
light
body
but
there
just
not
much
flavor
here
pretty
bland
overall
a
pleasant
pilsner
very
drinkable
poured

lifting

quite
light

although
not
dramatically
different

it

edge
above
theres
a
decent
pleasant
bitter
hops
finish
which
lasts
label
says
theyve
been
brewing
since
1004
and
i
see
why
theyre
still
going
strong
d
very
nicely
done
one
never
knows
what
to
expect
with
unknown
beers
from
europe
bit
this
one
turned
out
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
a
rich
malty
aroma
turns
into
a
light
grainy
flavor
profile
with
more
than
enough
hop
character
to
keep
it
balanced
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
prosit
poured
into
a
becker
a
light
golden
with
a
thinner
wispy
white
headalot
of
tiny
bubbles
sharp
herbal
hops
and
metallic
aromasthe
big
hops
remind
me
somewhat
of
a
northern
german
pilsnerits
quite
sharp
flavors
again
are
sharp
with
herbal
hopslightly
toasted
and
grainy
with
that
hard
waterironlike
tinge
to
it
as
well
to
me
this
lager
is
saaz
hops
on
steroidsits
almost
to
brask
for
my
taste
and
iam
a
hophead
cheers
i
cant
imagine
this
is
what
this
is
meant
to
taste
like
something
must
be
wrong
with
the
bottle
neat
cap
for
my
collection
though
overall
i
could
not
enjoy
this
beer
the
taste
is
fatally
flawed
by
that
off
flavor
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
also
quite
refreshing
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
aroma
is
strong
with
caramel
malt
the
taste
starts
with
the
caramel
sweetness
and
then
becomes
slightly
bitter
and
then
finishes
with
more
malty
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
crisp
overall
a
great
beer
to
have
some
sausage
and
kraut
with
d
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
pilsener
the
offtasting
sourness
didnt
leave
me
wanting
another
the
palate
opens
with
the
complex
flavor
of
pilsner
malt
bread
a
little
dough
a
little
honey
all
very
raw
and
cereallike
hops
are
on
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
with
a
mild
lemon
and
earthy
character
rather
delicate
bitterness
is
mediumlight
present
mostly
in
the
finish
while
light
in
body
this
has
a
fullness
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
better
pilsners
out
there
however
this
finish
isnt
all
together
despite
the
modest
bitterness
this
beer
does
devolve
into
being
a
little
watery
carbonation
is
high
providing
a
nice
drying
scrubbing
finish
while
not
the
best
beer
of
the
style
this
is
still
one
that
i
could
easily
drink
half
a
case
of
if
presented
with
the
opportunity
d
best
czech
lager
ive
had
so
far
very
drinkable
i
would
argue
a
winwin
for
anybody
who
enjoys
lagers
and
especially
for
a
domestic
macro
drinker
d
a
bit
towards
the
malty
side
but
fairly
balanced
and
tasty
a
nice
surprise
easy
enough
to
drink
but
lacking
the
crisp
crackery
nature
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
this
one
would
have
to
rank
farther
down
the
imported
bohemian
pils
chain
in
my
towns
finer
booze
emporiums
kind
of
a
disappointment
given
exactly
where
this
one
comes
from
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
sweet
smelling
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
light
hop
nose
and
a
somewhat
dry
clean
finish
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
light
clean
tasting
flavor
that
boasts
of
pilsner
malts
and
not
much
else
where
are
the
hops
here
its
dry
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
faint
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
would
like
some
additional
hop
character
but
it
drinks
well
without
a
doubt
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
us
consumer
its
a
slam
dunk
if
youre
looking
for
a
refreshing
clean
and
tasty
pilsner
a
hearty
bowl
of
beef
stew
would
make
for
a
delicious
pairing
drinkability
there
are
better
pilseners
to
be
had
but
this
is
worth
a
bottle
or
two
for
fanatics
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
had
higher
expectations
i
wouldnt
estimate
this
bottle
to
be
at
optimum
freshness
but
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
due
to
the
lack
of
bottle
dating
much
much
better
than
the
ubiquitous
puesdopilsners
but
there
are
many
better
and
more
affordable
options
pils
are
delicate
beers
and
overseas
journeys
dont
do
them
any
favors
id
love
to
try
this
fresh
in
its
native
czech
republic
but
in
the
meantime
ill
grab
a
prima
or
pikeland
the
next
time
i
need
a
pils
fix
appears
a
bright
golden
transparent
straw
color
forms
a
collar
of
white
thick
head
tight
bubbled
nice
lacing
aroma
has
pale
biscuit
malts
spicy
saaz
hops
green
grassy
herbal
qualities
just
a
very
nice
smell
here
flavor
equally
pleasant
and
quaffable
brngs
some
glory
back
to
the
czech
lagers
after
the
dumbing
down
of
pilsner
urquell
nice
toasted
malts
blended
into
a
biscuitcracker
flavor
backed
with
spicyherbal
noble
hops
its
no
victory
prima
as
far
as
aggressiveness
in
terms
of
bitterness
but
its
hoppy
definitely
a
well
made
czech
pils
mouthfeel
is
crisp
dry
refreshing
never
falls
flat
extremely
refreshing
taste
this
is
liquid
bread
and
its
light
bodied
lager
it
now
makes
more
since
why
the
czechs
drink
more
beer
per
capita
than
any
other
nation
solid
from
beginning
to
end
i
hope
to
find
myself
a
steady
fresh
supply
of
this
currently
served
at
giant
eagle
market
district
in
robinson
md
clean
crisp
mediumminus
bodied
all
good
but
pasteurisation
has
somehow
taken
away
the
real
charm
of
a
czech
lager
that
could
be
enjoyed
more
fully
while
being
served
unpasteurised
in
its
homeland
the
dry
finish
is
of
lightly
buttered
corn
mouthfeel
is
light
lightmoderate
3
out
of
10
thickness
slightly
zingy
carbonation
taste
is
pretty
unremarkable
i
guess
a
bit
of
caramel
and
silage
a
very
good
pilsner
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
exact
flavors
i
expect
out
of
a
pils
drinkability
is
good
nothing
too
exciting
but
it
drinks
easily
enough
cheers
500ml
from
capital
marketsalem
had
a
horrible
pour
head
went
crazy
but
after
it
settled
its
a
golden
beer
with
a
slightly
off
white
tight
bubbly
head
good
pils
aroma
spicy
grassy
hops
with
a
huge
bready
malt
backing
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
very
good
strong
sweet
cake
maltiness
at
the
start
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
in
the
end
leaving
a
small
bitter
aftertaste
palte
is
average
for
style
maybe
trails
off
a
bit
too
much
in
the
end
over
all
a
pleasant
enough
pils
would
love
to
taste
fresh
as
i
think
this
bottle
was
trashed
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
quickly
settled
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
it
is
missing
the
saaz
hop
aroma
that
this
style
posesses
but
it
does
not
smell
skunky
either
i
pick
up
a
lot
of
bready
malt
and
yeast
not
as
hoppy
bitter
and
dry
as
the
better
czech
pilseners
mostly
malt
flavor
upfront
with
the
hop
flavor
coming
in
at
the
finish
bitterness
is
low
as
well
nothing
wrong
with
the
flavor
but
just
a
bit
meh
also
it
is
not
as
crisp
and
clean
as
the
better
pilseners
light
bodied
with
spirited
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
with
a
low
abv
would
allow
great
consumption
but
i
would
prefer
a
different
kind
of
pilsener
na
zdraví
d
good
for
a
nice
warm
day
but
not
as
good
as
other
czech
pilseners
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
crisp
hops
and
a
little
less
malty
sweet
body
this
is
more
of
a
balanced
lager
reminiscent
of
some
helles
beers
from
germany
with
a
bit
more
saaz
as
opposed
to
hallertau
or
hersbrucker
that
said
it
still
drinks
very
easy
and
the
flavors
are
pretty
good
does
not
taste
too
old
but
i
am
sure
it
would
be
better
at
the
source
i
am
definitely
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
at
3
bucks
a
bottle
i
cannot
see
myself
getting
this
one
very
often
d
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
low
abv
and
light
body
but
there
isnt
much
to
the
smell
and
taste
just
some
like
wheat
and
bready
malts
not
bad
but
wouldnt
really
look
to
buy
again
i
could
down
these
one
after
another
washing
down
a
pizza
or
finishing
off
some
wings
anything
an
american
lager
can
do
this
can
do
better
i
guess
a
century
of
brewing
leads
to
perfection
in
the
style
d
drinkability
is
good
goes
down
easy
with
no
major
flaws
a
worthy
pilsner
overall
very
refreshing
and
held
up
well
this
was
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
beer
fridge
for
several
months
before
being
sampled
zatec
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
half
liter
bottle
the
aroma
is
a
bit
spicy
the
flavor
is
a
bit
spicy
from
hops
but
definitely
quite
malty
this
is
a
nice
czech
pils
that
doesnt
seem
to
be
very
widely
available
around
here
too
bad
i
like
it
better
than
a
lot
of
the
other
ones
we
get
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
that
showcases
the
zatec
saaz
hop
growing
reigon
very
well
d
a
classic
czech
pils
in
some
respects
but
sweeter
than
i
would
expect
that
said
this
is
perhaps
closer
to
the
standard
than
the
skunky
bottles
of
pilsner
urquell
we
can
get
in
the
us
there
is
however
a
spice
note
that
calls
too
much
attention
to
itself
to
make
the
overall
drinkability
exceptional
the
spice
note
does
lessen
as
the
beer
warms
fwiw
pours
pale
golden
with
a
nice
compact
bright
white
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
the
head
fades
quickly
but
leave
a
nice
protective
layer
that
lasted
as
long
as
the
beer
did
bready
grassy
sweet
aroma
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
with
a
nice
spicy
zing
from
the
hops
both
up
front
and
in
the
finish
lots
of
grassy
herbal
notes
and
maybe
a
touch
of
citrus
plenty
of
biscuity
malt
sweetness
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
bit
light
on
bitterness
for
style
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
with
a
good
clean
aftertaste
light
bodied
and
goes
down
easy
not
as
in
your
face
as
a
lot
of
other
pils
maybe
a
good
gateway
beer
from
bmc
this
is
a
great
thirst
quenching
beer
and
i
could
down
quite
a
few
a
fine
pilsner
with
more
flavor
than
most
both
bready
malt
and
noble
hop
flavors
shine
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
the
aroma
is
fairly
nondescript
nothing
bad
but
not
much
more
than
a
fresh
dinner
roll
malt
note
the
malt
is
a
bit
too
simply
sweet
but
the
hops
cut
right
through
the
sugar
its
a
surprisingly
big
flavor
for
the
abv
and
style
a
pleasant
surprise
d
very
mild
for
this
style
zatec
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
the
surprise
favorite
by
a
long
shot
of
the
weekend
to
sum
it
up
all
i
can
say
is
ehh
moderate
middle
of
the
road
etc
ive
been
told
theres
record
of
zatec
paying
taxes
in
1004
so
after
a
thousand
years
it
only
makes
sense
that
they
could
brew
a
great
lager
pour
of
a
golden
yellow
color
with
not
that
much
head
on
it
white
head
without
lace
nose
is
very
floral
or
lavender
and
pollen
sweet
malt
honey
palate
is
not
crisp
hoppy
but
is
clean
and
a
mild
sweet
has
that
quality
of
musky
straw
but
not
coarse
or
alkaline
easier
to
drink
that
crechvar
a
quiet
czech
pils
that
has
more
malt
then
most
but
i
liked
it
either
way
and
is
a
solid
sessionable
brew
that
stands
on
its
own
over
most
if
not
all
macro
type
lagers
or
pils
very
average
on
all
levels
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
an
old
bottle
the
lack
of
a
date
or
batch
numbering
scheme
is
almost
never
a
good
thing
drinkability
highly
drinkable
although
i
think
the
unbalanced
maltiness
would
get
to
me
after
a
little
while
d
pilsner
crush
it
drink
it
all
night
not
high
enough
in
alcohol
to
get
you
in
trouble
unless
youre
a
real
jackass
and
tasty
enough
to
drink
with
enjoyment
a
bit
lightthinweak
for
my
taste
but
very
fresh
and
clean
tasting
poured
into
a
mug
a
very
nice
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
white

with
some
nice

the
taste
is

this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
serving
type
bottle
when
pouring
this
czech
beer
the
foam
was
white
with
a
hint
of
beigh
bubbly
and
stuck
to
the
glass
taste
and
smell
had
a
typical
pilsner
hoppy
feel
the
color
was
light

mouthfeel
was

smooth

drinkibility
coppery
golden
with
a
soft
and
foamy
pure

that
leaves
fine

on
the
glass
smells
of
grassy
slightly
mentholmint
hops
with
rich

tastes
rich
and
smooth
with
fresh
bready
malt
and
grassy
saaz
hops
light
bodied
and
refreshing
with
nice
hop
bittering
in
the
finish
a
great
session
beer
and
way
underrated
imo
many
others
offer
greater
delights
in
the
fascinating
world
of
czech
pilsners
mfd
the
feel
is
slightly
thicker
and
heavier
than
water
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
the
beer
feel
quite
dull
over
all
i
would
preferably
find
another
beer
rather
than
have
another
one
of
these
overall
it
is
a
light
beer
that
to
me
is
kinda
skunky
it
is
easy
drinking
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonation
with
a
sight
bitterness
at
the
end
the
finish
lingers
in
your
mouth
but
for
just
a
second
not
a
great
pilsner
just
okay
pours
a
clear
darkish
yellow
color
body
big
foamy
white
head
lasting
strong
malty
aroma
some
balancing
hops
and
dryness
present
too
some
fresh
grain
scents
nutty
malty
taste
clean
tasting
somewhat
grainy
nutty
aftertaste
crisp
satisfying
and
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
very
carbonated
not
too
shabby
less
flavor
as
it
warms
moderately
malty
sweet
on
the
palate
hops
rush
in
to
dry
things
out
decent
balance
very
refreshing
very
drinkable
the
aroma
is
like
corn
malt
with
some
grassy
hops
the
appearance
is
pale
gold
with
a
foamy
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
latex
the
palate
is
watery
overall
its
nothing
i
want
again
and
everything
is
weak
make
sure
you
pass
this
one
up
d
surprisingly
so
dunno
if
they
threw
some
vienna
in
there
but
i
could
go
for
a
few
more
of
these
my
expectations
where
met
d
light
beer
makes
for
superior
drinkability
a
500
ml
bottle
of
zatec
the
bottle
claims
since
1004
thats
a
a
thousands
plus
years
of
experience
and
sets
the
bar
pretty
high
for
this
beer
a
clear
golden
brew
with
a
modest
head
which
quickly
receded
into
nothingness
decent
aroma
of
grain
grass
and
hops
standard
pilsner
it
opens
up
nicely
as
the
beer
warms
crisp
malt
flavor
complemented
by
grassy
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
beer
finishes
quick
bitter
and
dry
this
is
a
drinkable
decent
brew
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
expectations
set
by
knowing
the
brewery
has
been
in
the
business
for
more
then
a
millennium
drinks
okay
my
advice
let
this
get
to
ale
temp
before
drinking
as
it
was
it
warmed
up
quite
a
bit
prior
to
sampling
otherwise
you
got
a
a
blah
czech
pils
here
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
a
bit
dry
and
with
great
sweetbitter
balance
both
being
a
little
light
but
leaing
toward
the
bitter
side
its
very
tingly
zesty
and
lively
with
a
light
herbal
cypressy
hop
quality
before
the
crisp
junipertoasted
breadgrain
finish
it
is
very
enjoyable
crisp
and
very
clean
and
if
not
too
cold
has
plenty
of
malt
and
hop
flavours
and
subtlety
however
this
beer
will
seem
unimpressively
bland
if
drunk
too
cold
the
feel
and
character
are
also
a
little
thinner
that
i
think
they
should
be
with
a
faint
wateriness
that
weakens
it
a
bit
notes
i
am
not
a
fan
of
lagers
this
beer
certifies
that
for
me
it
is
just
fine
but
that
is
the
point
it
is
just
forgettable
life
is
too
short
to
drink
such
uninspiring
beers
drinkability
not
great
but
not
absolutely
wretched
pours
a
clear
golden
color
nice
foam
and
lacing
skunky
aroma
a
bit
husky
and
decent
use
of
hops
spicy
hop
flavor
grainy
husky
lots
of
cereal
flavors
crisp
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
fan
of
the
flavor
so
wouldnt
want
too
many
in
a
sitting
ive
had
much
better
czech
beers
overall
i
got
this
because
it
was
on
sale
though
i
can
see
myself
getting
this
occasionaly
its
very
refreshing
prost
mouthfeeldrinkability
weak
and
flabby
the
miniscule
carbonation
level
never
gets
interesting
and
it
reinforces
the
poor
qualities
thus
far
in
the
tasting
undrinkable
notes
this
is
a
good
solid
czech
pilsener
it
was
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
honestly
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
pilseners
ive
tried
in
a
very
very
long
time
beautiful
i
shall
be
stocking
up
on
many
more
of
these
its
become
the
ideal
session
beer
for
this
summer
especially
after
a
long
hot
day
of
slinging
metal
around
and
welding
d
decent
drinkability
a
nice
flavor
overall
that
was
sweet
citrusy
making
for
a
moderately
good
drink
drinkability
very
sessionable
but
there
are
other
pilsners
id
choose
over
this
tasted
on
51408
d
very
drinkable
drink
away
maybe
a
little
too
light
but
very
refreshing
and
helped
quell
my
peppercorn
pork
tenderloin
all
in
all
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
ever
love
this
style
it
would
be
super
interesting
to
taste
this
baby
fresh
in
the
czech
republic
not
a
great
czech
pils
but
passable
maybe
the
more
aggressive
american
versions
have
spoiled
me
a
bit
but
this
could
use
just
a
tad
more
uumph
even
though
it
slides
down
with
ease
d
this
beer
has
crazy
drinability
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
have
had
that
is
light
in
flavor
yet
doesnt
come
with
adjuncts
just
pure
refreshment
im
just
taking
off
for
the
fact
that
its
fairly
expensive
at
my
local
store
from
it
also
not
a
good
sign
d
a
pretty
average
pilsner
for
the
most
part
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
just
not
anything
really
different
about
it
could
session
prosit
mk
pours
nicely
with
a
pretty
clear
gold
tone
and
a
smaller
off
white
head
nose
is
of
roasted
and
cooked
cereals
mild
sweet
tone
is
also
there
a
bit
earthy
also
shall
we
say
flavor
is
eh
okay
mild
cereal
character
and
a
slim
fruit
aspect
dont
really
hold
out
for
long
and
it
drops
out
fairly
quickly
at
least
quicker
than
i
would
like
it
to
still
it
is
okay
enough
i
suppose
feel
is
typical
really
and
not
too
exciting
overall
this
is
an
okay
pilsener
but
for
the
prie
i
have
to
say
no
very
solid
a
little
different
fuller
than
what
i
expect
from
the
style
id
buy
this
again
when
im
looking
for
authentic
pilsner
beer
when
your
region
is
famous
for
its
hops
its
tough
to
go
wrong
its
a
must
to
try
this
when
the
bottle
is
fresh
an
old
bottle
wont
do
you
any
favors
the
taste
was
pretty
nice
some
sweet
malt
bread
grain
that
put
together
placed
it
on
the
sweet
side
but
there
was
some
decent
hop
character
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
made
it
pretty
darned
drinkable
it
had
a
light
mouthfeel
and
it
finished
fairly
crisp
and
dry
i
think
this
would
make
a
very
good
beer
to
session
on
mouthfeel
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
light
carbonation
smoother
than
expected
for
a
czech
lager
i
didnt
sense
the
saaz
aromas
of
grainy
texture
i
associate
with
saaz
hops
a
favorite
of
mine
maybe
this
bottle
was
a
little
old
drinkability
an
ok
pilsner
but
nothing
particularly
special
easy
to
knock
back
drinkability
solid
and
tasty
brew
simple
and
satisfying
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
i
like
the
malt
balance
as
well
as
how
they
have
the
hops
playing
such
a
big
role
in
the
aroma
and
then
a
supporting
role
in
the
whole
flavor
presentation
this
beer
definitely
has
more
malt
presence
than
i
am
used
to
for
this
style
and
i
like
that
i
think
that
since
the
guidelines
for
this
style
are
broad
enough
to
encompass
this
beer
i
will
score
it
pretty
high
based
on
that
very
drinkable
and
closer
to
the
style
than
most
american
attempts
500
ml
brown
bottle
pours
a
medium
yellow
body
with
an
attractive
white
head
plenty
of
patchy
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
spicy
hops
and
sweet
grainy
malts
light
body
with
a
zesty
carbonation
taste
features
the
hops
which
are
spicy
and
a
bit
earthy
grainy
and
bready
malt
becomes
much
too
sweet
hop
bitterness
returns
to
rescue
the
finish
and
make
for
a
nice
drinking
pils
d
incredibly
drinkable
as
far
as
pilseners
go
which
i
find
to
be
quite
quaffable
anyway
i
find
the
flavor
profile
stands
out
amongst
others
of
its
ilk
nevertheless
i
did
enjoy
this
beers
rather
unique
composition
for
a
style
that
was
built
on
replication
of
perfection
to
me
this
one
stands
out
and
is
worthy
of
a
taste
from
the
seasoned
beer
veteran
to
the
novice
as
i
think
its
characteristics
will
delight
either
one
darker
than
gold
with
a
white
head
that
didnt
hold
that
well
but
left
some
nice
lace
on
the
glass
nose
wasnt
as
strong
as
i
would
have
hoped
for
but
still
had
a
nice
malty
hoppy
thing
going
on
taste
was
a
lot
better
than
what
the
nose
suggested
nice
malt
character
with
a
hoppy
finish
fuller
body
than
expected
as
well
not
too
dry
soft
and
somewhat
silky
really
refreshing
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
pours
with
a
respectable
pils
head
lacing
is
damn
fine
smell
is
of
a
fresh
picked
hop
and
honey
corn
flakes
refreshing
drink
good
amount
of
bitters
not
bad
would
love
to
try
fresh
on
tap
goes
down
smooth
but
there
is
something
just
a
tad
off
about
it
that
makes
it
a
good
beer
and
not
a
great
one
the
beer
decamps
the
500ml
bottle
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
twofingered
creamy
white
head
the
head
settles
slowly
leaving
a
thick
sheet
to
cover
the
glass
nose
has
a
dominate
malt
sweetness
citrus
crisp
start
has
a
pleasant
malt
profile
slight
hop
bite
at
the
back
top
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
modest
acidity
the
hop
delectably
spicy
quite
dry
and
a
smooth
drinking
beer
cannot
say
pilsners
are
my
favorites
but
a
good
ones
like
this
is
always
a
pleasure
to
sample
a
very
nice
interesting
pils
with
a
little
more
malt
than
most
gold
honey
color
initial
soft
barley
aroma
on
the
pour
that
diminishes
with
subsequent
smelling
thin
white
creamy
head
that
also
diminishes
fairly
soon
clean
and
mildly
rich
barley
flavor
with
a
minty
hop
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
soft
i
like
this
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
but
i
do
not
think
it
stands
even
with
the
czech
allstars
however
it
is
a
cousin
to
them
better
than
a
lot
of
the
czech
beer
i
explored
just
to
find
the
cheapest
beer
deal
in
the
czech
republic
still
a
well
made
beer
and
worth
a
shot
pours
out
a
honey
color
with
no
bubble
action
and
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
ring
smells
of
soft
floral
hops
honey
pale
malt
and
has
a
graininess
really
disappointing
flavor
here
as
it
tastes
awfully
similar
to
heineken
and
its
ilk
really
sweet
maltiness
with
a
overbearing
graininess
and
faint
hop
character
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
edge
to
the
finish
but
overall
this
is
pretty
sweet
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
relaxed
bubbly
sensation
on
the
tongue
this
is
soso
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
czech
lager
but
got
something
that
was
quite
blah
zatecky
pivovar
has
a
long
storied
tradition
of
brewing
im
a
little
skeptical
of
the
since
1004
on
the
label
since
ive
always
thought
that
brauwerei
weihenstephan
is
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
having
started
operations
in
1040
in
any
case
zatec
is
far
from
the
best
czech
pilsener
on
the
planet
and
isnt
worth
a
purchase
as
far
as
im
concerned
really
but
not
a
bad
little
pils
worth
a
try
a
really
nice
czech
pilsener
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
from
a
500ml
bottle
two
finger
snow
white
head
shrunk
to
a
finger
or
finger
and
a
half
but
stayed
put
nonetheless
streams
of
co2
continuously
traveled
skyward
throughout
the
drink
smell
was
a
bit
grainy
and
of
course
rather
strong
of
lager
yeast
some
saaz
detectable
very
average
i
would
say
neither
being
offensive
nor
particularly
special
taste
was
malty
up
front
with
definite
saaz
presence
on
the
back
end
i
felt
this
was
a
better
than
average
czech
pilsener
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
subtle
yet
enjoyable
flavour
i
felt
in
the
way
czechs
this
was
much
better
than
pilsener
urquell
a
definite
session
lager
if
thats
your
thing
not
bad
all
things
considered
it
is
always
a
shame
when
a
beer
scores
so
well
in
appearance
and
smell
but
doesnt
deliver
in
the
taste
department
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
just
not
a
great
one
i
cold
see
tasting
this
again
in
europe
but
there
is
no
reason
to
get
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
a
below
average
czech
pils
no
real
flaws
except
for
blandness
d
not
great
but
an
average
czech
pils
maybe
a
little
over
priced
at
3
for
a
1pint
0
9oz
bottle
great
czech
beer
in
an
amber
bottle
classic
grainy
bitter
sweet
profile
bright
like
the
label
says
lager
nice
head
with
plenty
of
lace
very
good
carbonation
good
bittersweet
finish
too
and
a
good
session
beer
if
this
is
your
style
clear
yellow
gold
color
extra
clean
character
fairly
dry
with
an
almost
tartness
though
not
really
biscuit
like
malt
and
a
fresh
grain
character
are
accented
by
a
hint
of
butterscotch
the
beer
is
fairly
well
carbonated
which
provides
an
extra
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
a
touch
more
palate
cleansing
character
herbal
hop
notes
evoke
thoughts
of
lemon
grass
hints
of
mint
fresh
cut
hay
and
an
almost
green
basil
like
thing
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
touch
of
lemonlike
tartness
this
is
on
the
dry
side
for
a
traditional
czech
pilsner
it
seems
to
be
lacking
that
malt
fullness
and
even
the
diacetyl
is
a
touch
on
the
lower
end
still
this
is
a
decent
beer
one
which
i
would
happily
consume
a
few
pints
of
a
potent
grainylike
scent
but
it
delivers
a
nice
smooth
flavor
not
sharp
like
some
pilsners
can
be
and
no
bitterness
fresh
and
easy
going
a
good
summer
beer
very
easy
drinking
light
carbonation
with
a
delicate
body
no
offensive
qualities
clearly
a
fresh
sample
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
night
overall
a
runofthemill
lager
that
does
nothing
to
excite
me
not
so
bad
for
the
style
but
then
again
its
not
a
style
im
into
anyway
pours
with
a
dirty
gold
color
and
a
head
that
never
quite
dissipates
slight
aroma
of
some
salty
bananas
and
cooked
grains
theres
relatively
little
saaz
character
for
a
beer
so
named
on
the
palate
rather
bland
and
inoffensive
with
bitter
hops
kicking
things
off
before
things
become
a
bit
more
rounded
with
pale
malts
nothing
too
deep
or
interesting
mouthfeel
is
light
with
medium
carbonation
with
yet
again
no
distinguishing
characteristics
overall
this
is
a
blah
beer
that
has
little
to
recommend
it
but
little
to
leave
a
drinker
disgusted
it
commits
the
cardinal
sin
of
being
nothing
pleasant
and
drinkable
beer
typical
czech
pils
overall
a
fine
and
refreshing
pilsner
that
goes
down
great
a
yellow
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
overall
well
done
pilsener
very
much
to
style
pils
pours
a
golden
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
there
is
a
nice
crisp
aroma
with
small
hints
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
rich
with
some
noticeable
hop
flavors
that
leaves
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
good
body
and
very
nice
strong
flavors
overall
its
a
nice
strong
pils
with
a
nice
noticeable
hop
and
bitterness
schells
pils
is
just
plain
wonderful
need
i
say
more
dozens
of
small
craft
breweries
pine
for
being
as
successful
as
schells
summit
has
made
it
sierra
nevada
has
made
it
sam
adams
has
made
and
hundreds
more
when
it
is
all
said
and
done
good
old
schells
right
in
our
backyard
has
been
one
to
succeed
its
a
yellow
beer
with
a
solid
sheet
of
fine
bone
white
foam
that
seems
unrelenting
smells
like
grain
hints
of
corn
some
sweetness
some
metal
flavor
is
what
i
would
consider
pretty
hoppy
for
the
style
sharp
musty
hops
with
some
hints
of
resin
and
metal
alongside
a
nice
crisp
malt
undertow
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carb
and
a
nice
dry
finish
nice
beer
o
good
pilsener
although
not
a
staple
of
the
style
i
like
the
hit
of
hops
clean
and
refreshing
any
fan
of
the
style
will
dig
schells
pils
this
is
actually
a
really
damn
good
pilsner
its
a
bit
more
aggressive
in
the
hopping
than
i
am
used
to
but
like
any
good
midwestern
lager
it
is
still
delicately
balanced
and
refined
it
is
effervescent
yet
silky
across
the
tongue
too
o
a
very
enjoyable
pilsner
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
tasted
clean
and
crisp
without
sacrificing
flavor
hint
of
malt
sweetness
balanced
by
earthy
noble
hop
character
thanks
to
flax
for
this
one
o
great
drinkability
a
great
german
pilsner
in
my
book
schells
really
knows
how
to
brew
their
lagers
decent
as
far
as
beers
go
pretty
damn
good
considering
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
american
take
on
a
pilsner
good
balance
of
bready
sweetness
and
spicy
hops
final
thoughts
i
actually
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
average
for
a
pilsener
it
was
much
tastier
when
i
had
it
ontap
a
few
months
ago
though
overall
this
beer
like
their
others
is
well
crafted
and
distributed
pretty
well
stacks
up
next
to
the
better
ones
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
head
dissipates
slowly
very
clear
as
expected
with
evident
carbonation
pleasant
grassy
hop
aroma
not
a
lot
of
maltiness
on
the
nose
flavor
is
very
good
with
more
hop
bitterness
than
expected
good
balance
and
a
nice
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
great
for
the
style
carbonation
is
perfect
appropriate
viscosity
leaves
a
very
nice
flavor
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
great
domestic
pils
very
drinkable
free
of
off
flavors
i
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
do
this
bavarianstyle
pilsner
is
a
rare
flower
bomb
although
it
isnt
a
beer
that
seems
likely
to
shock
it
manages
to
catch
the
palate
completely
offguard
with
the
emphasis
it
places
upon
floral
tincture
the
quality
is
nothing
like
the
airy
and
dilute
floral
of
cascade
hops
yet
it
stops
short
of
tasting
artificial
it
is
hard
to
predict
how
such
a
beer
would
be
received
by
drinkers
all
around
this
is
a
relatively
easy
drinking
beer
at
somewhat
of
a
premium
price
for
what
you
get
straw
yellow
color
with
a
touch
of
gold
but
the
appearance
is
about
the
only
thing
average
about
this
beer
smells
clean
and
fresh
with
light
lemony
hops
and
rich
biscuity
notes
tastes
exceptionally
good
my
favorite
us
produced
pils
is
generally
trumer
pils
and
i
give
schells
a
better
score
trumer
seems
a
bit
thin
and
weak
in
comparison
this
is
rich
with
great
grain
flavors
lemony
biscuit
flavors
minty
with
what
should
be
if
its
not
an
award
winning
clean
dry
hops
finish
which
is
why
i
like
pilsner
beer
so
much
in
the
first
place
the
5
0
score
goes
to
the
mouthfeel
just
incredible
carbonation
spiky
at
first
and
expanding
until
it
thins
on
the
swallow
perfect
weight
for
this
style
not
too
thin
or
thick
i
cant
see
any
lover
of
great
pilsner
beer
not
going
absolutely
crazy
for
this
beer
overall
not
a
favorite
of
mine
a
little
too
bitter
but
its
still
good
and
very
refreshing
o
alright
it
is
decent
but
nothing
too
great
translucent
pale
straw
color
one
finger
short
lived
head
with
large
amounts
of
lacing
a
bit
undercarbonated
but
medium
bodied
smells
of
faint
citrus
hopping
over
a
sweeter
pilsener
malt
tastes
of
much
the
same
but
more
lemoney
than
citric
in
hopping
not
as
much
spiciness
as
a
typical
pilsener
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
typical
pilsener
as
well
but
none
of
these
issues
are
really
dealbreakers
in
severity
overall
a
very
delicious
pilsner
with
a
refreshingly
light
body
that
is
perfect
for
an
afternoon
on
the
boat
or
would
make
a
very
nice
session
beer
o
eh
its
drinkable
enough
but
the
flavor
profile
doesnt
fit
my
idea
of
a
top
notch
pilsner
d
very
drinkable
brew
another
good
brew
from
schells
a
nice
summer
sipper
with
a
clean
and
fresh
taste
very
easy
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
i
recommend
this
brew
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
worth
pounding
down
for
a
long
time
schells
pils
says
the
bottle
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
bumpy
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
bubbly
islands
smells
of
cereal
grains
and
noble
hops
hit
me
on
the
first
pour
which
kind
of
got
me
excited
about
drinking
this
beer
but
as
i
dig
into
it
i
have
trouble
finding
that
floralcracker
connection
again
not
a
ton
going
on
in
the
glass
i
could
tell
this
is
a
bit
high
abv
for
the
style
not
that
i
am
a
stickler
for
such
guidelines
but
the
higher
abv
does
nothing
for
the
beer
other
than
to
mask
the
delicate
pilsner
malt
i
can
taste
the
hops
just
fine
a
nice
clean
bitterness
to
go
with
the
warm
alcohol
i
still
get
some
floral
notes
from
the
postsip
lingerings
not
a
bad
drinker
overall
overall
clean
and
easy
drinking
if
not
outstanding
in
any
significant
way
o
i
was
not
expecting
much
out
of
this
one
but
for
a
pilsener
its
pretty
good
thanks
schells

the

hang

just
around
the
edges
left
some

then
that

for
a
little
while
also
notes
of
lemon
or
citrus
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
right
i
didnt
care
for
the
bitter
aftertaste
maybe
if
this
brew
was
ice
cold
some
of
the
bitterness
would
go
away
and
bring
out
the
citrus
i
only
had
one
bottle
to
try
do
i
remember
this
being
better
the
last
time
i
had
it
which
must
have
been
a
few
years
ago
still
a
quality
example
of
the
style
and
if
i
lived
in
minnesota
or
anywhere
distributed
it
would
be
a
goto
lower
abv
summer
beer
d
this
may
be
my
summer
drinker
i
am
thinking
at
least
the
one
to
have
around
the
house
drinkability
a
nice
no
frills
pils
very
true
to
the
style
i
can
dig
it
the
pour
was
decent
very
clear
golden
straw
in
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
bubbling
up
to
the
surface
a
big
head
of
white
quickly
faded
but
was
replaced
by
a
broken
crown
that
clung
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
light
grain
and
hay
a
touch
of
light
piney
hops
as
it
warms
but
nothing
really
bowling
me
over
here
as
you
take
a
sip
it
is
very
clean
very
crisp
but
does
not
have
a
terribly
great
depth
of
flavor
light
grain
note
light
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
but
the
flavor
is
fleeting
and
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
looking
for
a
sip
of
something
else
very
quickly
most
likely
the
reason
this
one
went
by
soo
quickly
this
is
a
bright
looking
offering
with
a
best
by
date
on
the
neck
of
031311
appears
a
brilliant
golden
hue
straw
colored
really
with
a
bright
white
eggshell
like
head
forms
fine
speckled
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
a
bit
of
sulfur
going
on
with
lemongrssherbal
and
a
bready
pale
malt
breadiness
with
hints
of
mineral
water
flavor
citriclemongrass
hops
actually
not
bad
at
all
not
strictly
german
style
but
its
got
a
craft
brewing
approach
harsh
bitterness
is
a
bit
lingering
compared
to
a
classic
clean
pils
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
effervescent
sturdy
carbonation
i
talked
about
the
finish
drinkability
overall
is
pretty
solid
a
nice
example
of
a
pils
just
not
as
good
as
the
pa
versions
d
okay
but
not
worth
seeking
out
unless
you
really
love
pilsners
d
there
isnt
much
special
about
this
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
there
is
really
nothing
negative
or
offensive
about
it
considering
the
delivery
of
quality
schells
offers
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
mind
keeping
some
of
this
in
my
cooler
definite
drinkability
a
solid
beer
choice
notes
this
pils
is
light
in
body
yet
very
flavorful
a
rock
solid
brew
from
the
folks
at
schells
as
it
has
superb
drinkability
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
grassy
hops
are
showcased
nicely
and
get
a
little
bit
floral
on
the
finish
malts
are
very
light
and
pretty
much
only
add
a
mildly
sweet
backdrop
and
a
surprisingly
creamy
body
lots
of
hop
flavor
and
lots
of
bitterness
make
this
finish
very
crisp
not
the
smoothest
pilsner
out
there
even
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
pretty
enjoyable
and
a
good
offering
from
schells
not
a
lot
going
on
but
the
bitterness
is
surprisingly
prominant
a
nice
session
beer
find
doesnt
hurt
that
is
was
the
cheapest
craft
beer
in
the
shop
pours
a
pale
golden
with
a
decent
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
decent
but
very
subdued
aroma
the
hops
that
are
detactable
lend
a
nice
citrusberry
and
pine
presence
taste
is
also
a
bit
subdued
but
it
is
pleasantly
hoppy
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
to
be
found
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
unexpectedly
undercarbonated
all
in
all
a
decent
and
drinkable
beer
though
not
outstanding
in
any
respect
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
ring
and
lacing
on
side
of
glass
looks
good
smell
is
floral
hops
with
grassy
and
grain
and
malt
smells
taste
is
crisp
with
a
hops
and
malts
nicely
balanced
this
is
not
the
best
pils
out
there
but
its
still
very
good
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
overall
the
beer
is
one
of
the
better
american
attempts
at
the
pils
style
not
bad
fairly
drinkable
schells
makes
good
beer
especially
when
it
comes
to
lagers
the
deer
brand
mai
bock
and
octoberfest
are
prime
examples
of
this
but
the
pilsner
is
hands
down
the
best
the
balance
of
hop
and
malt
is
nearly
perfect
few
so
called
pilsners
can
come
close
to
pilsner
urquell
the
original
and
schells
pilsner
is
the
best
american
example
best
drank
when
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
to
appreciate
the
color
and
head
that
never
fades
away
well
worth
the
11
49
a
12er
it
has
been
at
st
anthony
for
the
last
year
an
ok
to
goodish
pils
thats
simple
with
a
touch
of
german
complexity
a
definate
drinker
for
the
warmerhotter
day
of
springsummer
that
screams
outdoor
activity
refreshment
crisp
clean
light
bodied
and
properly
carbonated
this
is
a
pilsner
the
way
it
is
meant
to
be
very
drinkable
and
my
favorite
pilsner
on
the
market
so
far
imo
this
was
not
a
remarkable
beer
except
for
one
thing
the
salt
taste
that
i
got
made
this
beer
for
me
the
was
the
sixth
beer
from
a
schells
sampler
that
i
have
tried
and
i
have
been
impressed
by
the
sampler
in
fact
i
have
already
returned
to
the
store
to
buy
2
more
sixers
of
the
stout
drinkability
great
thirst
quencher
over
the
years
this
beer
has
become
better
balanced
and
more
smooth
a
nicelymade
pils
certainly
sessionable
this
is
what
the
macro
pilseners
should
be
not
as
clean
as
i
would
prefer
my
pils
but
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
pretty
good
beer
overall
reminds
me
a
little
of
grain
belt
d
its
just
a
touch
too
bitter
for
me
but
is
a
good
flavorful
pilsner
thats
also
fairly
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
but
one
of
the
better
versions
of
it
certainly
was
invited
to
the
beer
bus
tour
of
the
august
schell
brewery
in
new
ulm
but
had
to
work
decided
to
buy
the
sampler
pack
and
take
my
own
mini
tour
this
is
1
of
6
styles
going
to
drink
them
in
order
from
least
to
most
anticipated
and
im
now
really
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
them
d
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
hell
of
a
session
beer
and
makes
me
wish
i
could
get
it
regularly
if
i
could
this
would
be
my
lawnmower
baseball
game
tailgating
beer
of
choice
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
and
love
every
sip
i
liked
it
pours
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
nice
head
and
nice
bubbles
with
a
bit
of
decent
lacing
great
scent
a
deeply
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
pepper
excellent
taste
refreshing
and
crisp
a
great
malty
sweet
beer
with
a
nice
slight
pepper
finish
nice
noble
hops
goes
down
wonderfully
smooth
a
great
lawnmower
beer
or
any
time
beer
really
this
is
the
3rd
beer
out
of
the
schell
sampler
i
have
tried
and
so
far
they
are
2
of
3
i
would
buy
this
one
again
mouthfeeldrinkability
highly
carbonated
and
light
bodied
dan
easydrinking
fullflavored
pilsner
accessible
and
smooth
though
not
amazing
however
i
bet
this
one
would
be
an
amazing
postlawnmowing
beer
d
d
a
basic
but
good
german
pilsener
great
hot
weather
beer
as
easy
to
drink
as
any
of
this
style
easier
to
drink
with
each
sip
d
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
its
fairly
restrained
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
conclusion
not
a
bad
pilsener
but
nothing
standoutish
at
the
same
time
gives
me
something
to
look
forward
to
after
the
8
hour
trip
back
to
iowa
next
time
schells
pils
was
my
introduction
to
the
style
a
few
summers
ago
and
after
returning
to
it
i
think
i
prefer
its
balance
and
understated
flavors
to
some
of
the
hoppy
pilsners
floating
around
drinkablity
very
drinkable
ive
done
many
sessions
with
this
beer
over
the
years
and
its
always
one
of
my
favorite
schells
beers
the
august
schell
line
is
really
impressing
me
more
their
beers
got
me
into
better
beer
back
in
the
mid
80s
drinkability
is
high
the
flavor
profile
isnt
quite
there
for
me
and
niether
is
the
look
its
alright
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
grainy
and
sweet
light
floral
hops
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
for
a
pilsner
lots
of
grainy
malts
slightly
floral
with
hints
of
honey
and
herbal
hops
bitterness
is
there
but
nothing
crazy
pretty
well
balanced
actually
crisp
and
refreshing
lots
of
carbonation
a
good
take
on
a
pilsner
and
another
solid
offering
from
schells
a
pleasant
lighter
beer
good
for
a
hot
day
and
even
as
a
stepping
stone
beer
quite
nice
all
around
d
allowing
it
to
settle
for
a
minute
changed
my
perception
and
this
is
definitely
a
session
beer
i
can
drink
d
take
the
metallic
aftertaste
away
and
this
is
a
solid
pils
i
understand
the
reasons
there
could
be
a
metallic
aftertaste
but
this
is
too
much
drank
half
poured
half
d
high
this
is
my
new
fav
from
this
brewery
great
beer
taste
maltiness
up
front
followed
by
bitterness
its
a
really
overlooked
style
and
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
one
but
it
ended
up
being
a
really
solid
beer
very
drinkable
but
so
are
most
pils
i
most
likely
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
but
its
still
an
average
beer
overal
this
beer
is
okay
and
i
might
buy
it
again
in
the
summertime
maybe
this
isnt
quite
my
style
overall
this
is
one
solid
pilsner
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
schells
hit
the
prime
spot
here
i
definitely
would
recommend
this
hv
could
dry
a
few
on
nice
hot
day
the
taste
is
bread
toasted
grain
pine
lemon
and
a
hint
of
nuts
it
has
a
firm
malty
body
with
enough
sweetness
and
character
to
carry
the
definite
hoppy
flavour
and
bitterness
to
it
it
is
lively
engaging
with
nice
complexity
zesty
crisp
and
highly
enjoyable
overall
pours
slightly
hazed
amber
yellow
color
decent
sized
white
foam
the
head
shrinks
quickly
down
to
a
floating
film
leaves
thin
string
line
of
lace
slightly
grainy
smell
mild
hops
the
flavour
is
actually
quite
nice
toasted
malt
character
slightly
sweet
and
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
finish
the
body
is
full
for
the
style
good
carbonation
level
a
pretty
good
beer
all
around
well
made
with
no
faults
this
is
the
taste
i
am
looking
for
in
a
pilsner
d
it
is
a
fine
session
beer
for
this
style
it
has
low
abv
is
light
bodied
and
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
however
it
is
not
a
remarkable
beer
best
pils
ive
had
yet
appearance
is
crystalclear
straw
yellow
with
a
tight
white
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
that
familiar
biscuit
and
cereal
grain
pils
malt
with
lots
of
pretty
noble
hops
flavor
much
the
same
with
medium
hop
bitterness
finish
is
a
bit
dry
for
the
style
almost
tastes
a
bit
overattenuated
but
very
crisp
and
refreshing
an
excellent
example
of
a
pilsener
be
sure
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
mass
quantities
mouthfeel
was
medium
density
somewhat
zesty
in
the
mouth
drinkability
quite
good
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
which
it
is
here
in
chitown
this
beer
used
to
be
a
bit
hoppier
thus
perhaps
finishing
a
bit
drier
as
i
try
and
remember
it
from
over
a
decade
ago
but
i
gotta
hand
to
the
folks
in
new
ulm
this
is
still
a
nicely
made
german
pilsener
it
tastes
more
of
a
bavarianstyle
pils
tending
sweet
versus
a
lower
saxonykind
of
pils
tending
dry
whatever
this
is
nice
stuff
drinkability
is
decent
on
this
beer
smooth
balanced
and
refreshing
i
doubt
i
will
seek
this
beer
out
but
i
wouldnt
opt
for
water
if
this
was
offered
either
worth
a
try
d
i
remembered
this
being
better
than
it
is
the
finish
seems
really
off
and
there
isnt
quite
as
much
hop
presence
as
i
was
expecting
mouthfeel
i
thought
this
had
good
carbonation
with
an
excellent
balance
for
a
someone
like
my
folks
who
drink
the
bmc
stuff
not
as
crisp
of
a
finish
as
id
like
for
a
pils
but
still
very
drinkable
tasted
on
33108
drinkability
a
bit
light
an
easy
drinking
beer
sessionable
yes
but
i
tend
to
like
my
session
beers
around
5
abv
or
less
at
least
when
i
am
planning
on
consuming
6
or
more
or
drinking
all
day
still
this
is
a
good
beer
that
if
the
price
were
right
6
or
less
i
would
pick
up
again
good
for
bmc
drinker
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
an
affordable
beer
that
should
be
given
a
try
for
a
good
step
up
from
macros
this
beer
hits
the
spot
only
6
99
a
six
or
5
99
if
you
find
it
on
sale
it
is
an
inexpensive
stepping
stone
beer
a
well
made
pilsner
that
wont
scare
people
away
d
i
dont
care
for
this
one
this
is
nothing
at
all
like
the
style
should
be
and
the
lemonade
flavors
are
off
putting
for
me
way
to
sour
and
tart
for
sessioning
this
is
more
like
a
shitty
wheat
beer
than
a
german
pils
d
a
decent
sessioner
this
pils
is
a
pleasant
drink
from
schells
d
very
try
it
if
you
can
drinkability
schell
well
well
what
have
we
here
a
light
even
for
a
pilsner
thats
what
this
pours
a
regular
beer
color
yellow
with
a
nice
medium
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
a
hair
grainy
the
taste
is
the
winner
here
this
reminds
me
of
the
beer
i
had
in
northern
germany
excellent
blend
of
hops
lemon
and
malt
very
enjoyable
the
joy
lasts
to
the
last
sip
good
beer
poured
an
attractive
yellowgolden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
not
real
strong
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
of
hops
smooth
clean
and
crisp
lacing
on
glass
is
nice
i
thought
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
quencher
and
the
drinkability
of
this
one
is
very
high
i
enjoyed
it
is
hard
to
get
too
excited
about
most
pilsners
but
this
one
is
really
quite
good
attractive
blonde
in
the
glass
but
more
complex
taste
and
aroma
than
might
be
expected
from
the
appearance
light
floral
hop
notes
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
where
it
is
mixed
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
top
note
not
much
of
a
head
very
drinkable
with
pleasant
mouthfeel
id
buy
more
of
this
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
it
i
only
wish
it
was
just
a
touch
less
sweet
session
breer
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
and
more
syrupy
than
expected
had
it
been
thinner
this
couldve
been
a
terrible
experience
as
it
is
its
simply
a
runofthemill
offering
there
are
many
better
german
pilsners
out
there
but
there
are
some
enjoyable
characteristics
in
the
flavor
and
especially
the
mouthfeel
that
helped
avoid
total
disaster
schell
pilsner
was
a
pale
golden
color
and
a
little
hazy
the
white
head
was
medium
in
size
with
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
light
malt
with
a
little
citrus
the
taste
was
malt
upfront
followed
by
a
nice
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
the
finish
was
dry
with
some
hops
and
bitterness
lingering
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
its
a
crisp
and
refreshing
lager
that
i
enjoy
on
occasion
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
14
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
an
all
malt
aroma
that
boasts
of
pale
and
munich
malts
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
pale
malt
flavor
with
some
munich
in
there
as
well
it
has
a
bitter
hop
bite
that
really
turns
me
off
it
has
a
nice
malty
taste
but
the
finish
is
unfavorable
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
but
not
my
favorite
for
sure
d
a
pretty
nice
pilsner
representation
nothing
special
but
it
makes
a
descent
session
brew
overall
good
example
of
a
german
pils
but
nothing
exceptional
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
pils
and
this
is
available
id
recommend
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
poured
into
a
pilsner
a
light
straw
yellow
with
a
large
blooming
bone
white
head
that
held
great
retention
nice
and
spritzey
looking
very
grainy
aromas
like
wet
grain
and
mineral
at
first
unappetizing
but
it
grew
on
me
after
a
bit
quite
dry
and
toasty
malt
tilted
flavors
quite
grainy
lightly
sweet
doughy
finish
with
a
decent
herbal
smack
of
hops
in
the
finish
somewhat
basic
but
with
a
little
character
the
herbal
finish
was
its
saving
grace
in
my
opinion
drinkability
admittedly
the
light
lagers
are
not
my
normal
cup
of
tea
i
lean
towards
very
malty
beers
hwoever
this
is
great
refreshing
enough
for
a
hot
summers
day
yet
complex
enough
to
have
year
round
big
fan
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
this
brewery
d
i
was
quite
impressed
by
this
beer
as
it
was
not
like
i
expected
ive
had
this
beer
before
but
now
i
can
say
i
truly
took
the
time
to
appreciate
this
beer
i
cant
give
this
one
fives
yet
because
i
need
to
have
some
more
pilsners
this
one
turned
me
onto
them
again
and
im
glad
id
try
this
again
in
the
future
and
share
it
with
some
friends
next
time
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
pils
that
is
very
refreshing
d
not
exactly
a
muscular
pilsner
like
prima
pils
but
the
soft
malt
flavor
is
absolutely
delicious
very
crisp
mouthfeel
and
refreshing
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
good
local
example
of
a
pils
that
id
more
than
likely
try
again
overall
impression
easy
drinking
pilsner
big
thanks
to
chad
for
bringing
some
schell
beers
back
from
minnesota
for
us
the
aroma
is
of
the
typical
pilsnereurope
lager
a
mild
cabbagy
smell
with
the
more
predominant
mettalic
smell
to
me
this
tasted
alot
like
a
pilsner
urquell
quite
fizzy
on
the
tongue
with
a
dry
bitter
taste
and
finishes
very
chalky
maintains
a
slight
citrus
tang
on
the
way
down
the
aftertaste
lasts
forever
this
beer
started
out
like
a
traditional
bmc
type
beer
but
actually
ended
on
a
better
note
poured
to
a
light
golden
color
with
little
carbonation
head
or
lacing
aroma
was
very
grainy
and
not
real
pleasant
surprisingly
the
taste
was
somewhat
fruit
and
floral
with
a
good
lingering
aftertaste
while
not
a
great
beer
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
overall
a
very
nice
session
beer
tasty
and
drinkable
thanks
to
bulldogsturge
d
this
is
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
schell
measured
pour
into
a
antique
7
oz
pilsener
glass
produces
a
white
fairly
rocky
head
of
medium
duration
lacing
is
minimal
color
is
a
pale
goldenstraw
and
clear
to
brilliant
nose
is
straightforward
dominated
by
pale
and
pilsener
malts
dry
and
fairly
nonexpressive
dry
and
crisp
from
the
outset
with
a
mildly
fruity
middle
and
a
bitterastringent
finish
malty
yet
anything
but
sweet
as
theres
a
great
balance
here
thanks
to
ample
hop
bitterness
not
sour
but
has
notes
of
a
sour
fruit
rhubarb
in
addition
to
very
minor
hints
of
green
apple
or
crap
apple
mouthfeel
is
rather
full
but
not
heavy
and
it
is
certainly
not
fullbodied
but
moderate
drinks
lighter
than
5
5
seems
about
4
5
so
it
might
be
worth
keeping
in
mind
while
sessioning
this
its
quite
sessionable
i
know
that
the
recipe
was
tweaked
about
a
year
back
supposedly
to
yield
a
drier
rendition
of
a
pils
and
in
this
respect
i
think
theyve
succeeded
without
sacrificing
any
of
the
brews
original
character
or
drinkability
some
honey
notes
in
the
aromatics
and
some
great
malt
character
overall
along
with
a
notable
degree
of
lingering
bitterness
sampled
from
a
fresh
bottle
just
over
a
month
old
pours
a
four
finger
chunky

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
ia
its
a
very
tasty
american
pils
good
example
drinks
okay
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
to
be
sure
ph
golden
slightly
cloudy
appearance
a
bit
of
a
grainy
smell
but
not
bad
it
has
a
pilsnery
sweet
flavor
that
finishes
well
with
a
balanced
hoppy
finish
not
a
weak
bodied
beer
like
american
domestics
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
a
bit
tangy
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
good
session
beer
the
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
a
drier
finish
would
be
nice
overall
a
nice
6
to
pick
up
just
need
a
marker
to
spell
shell
right
decent
stab
at
a
pilsner
yellow
body
with
white
head
could
use
a
little
better
retention
grainy
but
clean
smell
lacks
personality
or
depth
slightly
fruity
with
a
sweet
malt
taste
slight
offflavor
maybe
from
adjunct
or
age
small
bite
at
the
end
with
a
little
lingering
bitterness
at
least
the
conbonation
feels
right
easy
drinking
and
can
wash
down
food
as
another
reviewer
noted
the
descriptive
copy
on
schells
bottles
could
use
some
work
quite
weak
floaties
aside
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
its
extremely
solid
and
particularly
well
done
the
fruit
elements
made
this
one
really
enjoyable
and
the
mouth
feel
was
particularly
solid
making
this
beer
an
easily
affordable
complete
package
starting
a
new
review
after
admiring
and
going
back
to
this
fine
beer
many
times
in
the
past
few
years
the
body
may
be
hazy
when
chilled
but
i
dont
believe
that
detracts
too
much
from
the
overall
experience
what
i
admire
most
about
this
beer
is
balance
sure
it
is
a
german
pilsener
a
style
not
known
for
huge
hops
but
this
beer
has
a
hop
profile
well
defined
impressive
and
very
complementary
to
the
slightly
sweet
malt
a
little
fruity
tasting
but
crisp
refreshing
and
one
of
the
best
bottled
beers
in
minnesota
my
favorite
of
the
style
hands
down
da
fine
pilsner
something
that
would
be
great
in
the
summer
either
by
the
pool
or
after
yard
work
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
mouthfeel
is
midviscosity
syrupy
and
carbonated
editing
well
i
waited
until
a
warm
autumn
day
and
sampled
a
bottle
at
the
schells
brewery
it
was
damn
near
perfect
im
guessing
that
the
beer
they
serve
there
is
at
the
perfect
maturation
stage
ane
well
cared
for
the
sterling
hops
were
just
amazingly
fresh
and
the
malt
was
crisp
with
a
light
sweet
distinct
graininess
i
could
have
sipped
this
beer
all
day
this
pilsner
pours
a
light
golden
to
dark
straw
color
with
a
minimal
amount
of
foam
i
think
i
can
detect
a
faint
flowery
hoppy
aroma
the
sweet
malt
flavor
is
up
front
with
a
sort
of
bubble
gumfruity
middle
and
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
first
tried
this
beer
about
a
dozen
years
ago
and
i
remember
it
as
a
spicier
hoppy
pilsner
this
is
still
a
decent
pilsner
but
its
doesnt
seem
as
magical
as
i
remmeber
it
being
perhaps
my
palate
has
changed
but
maybe
the
beer
has
changed
too
its
still
a
pretty
refreshing
pilsner
and
worth
trying
but
as
a
german
pilsner
it
comes
up
a
bit
short
pale
hazy
color
of
golden
ice
clouds
carrying
a
snowwhite
head
which
clings
to
the
glass
as
it
slowly
recedes
leaving
a
weblike
lace
long
after
the
entire
beer
is
gone
bready
floral
aroma
mouthfeel
is
substantial
and
helps
define
the
sharp
tangy
bite
hoppy
and
crisp
like
the
springy
pep
of
fresh
salad
greens
sort
of
a
gluey
finish
to
an
otherwise
grand
experience
poors
a
beatiful
golden
color
in
the
glass
a
tad
of
a
head
which
leaves
nice
sticky
lacing
down
the
inside
of
the
glass
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
grain
also
present
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
little
hoppiness
present
as
well
nicely
carbonated
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
one
of
the
best
american
pilsners
on
the
market
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
adds
to
the
summery
niche
this
beer
should
fill
this
is
another
example
of
why
schell
is
possibly
one
of
the
best
major
brewers
going
today
another
style
done
the
right
way
poured
out
to
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
medium
low
carbonation
nice
head
came
down
to
about
18
of
an
inch
no
lacing
noted
in
the
glass
odors
of
citrus
and
hops
are
well
balanced
taste
is
direct
and
straightforward
hops
malt
some
citrus
acidity
and
a
good
smooth
bitterness
finished
crisp
with
some
minor
malt
aftertaste
high
drinkability
if
this
was
readily
available
id
keep
some
on
hand
recommended
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
color
with
no
head
last
time
i
checked
pilsners
werent
supposed
to
be
cloudy
i
have
a
felling
this
might
foreshadow
whats
to
come
the
aroma
is
exacly
like
that
of
every
other
schell
product
thin
and
vaguely
sweet
the
taste
is
as
thin
as
the
smell
it
is
much
too
sweet
for
a
pilsner
the
mouthfeel
lacks
any
sort
of
crispness
overall
beer
is
a
big
disappointment
for
a
brewery
that
prides
itself
on
its
german
heritage
i
would
think
that
making
a
quality
pilsner
would
be
a
must
i
guess
not
d
this
is
a
very
nice
session
beer
it
has
lots
of
good
qualities
but
the
slight
fruitiness
in
the
finish
is
a
little
different
good
hops
in
this
pils
reviewing
this
simultaneously
with
lakefronts
klisch
pilsner
this
is
a
perfectly
average
beer
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
exactly
like
stereotypical
beer
pale
gold
malty
smooth
refreshing
utterly
lacking
any
distinguishing
characteristics
klisch
is
much
better
thanks
to
sopor
for
sending
me
a
couple
bottles
of
this
this
beer
is
hazy
gold
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
mediumsized
white
foamy
mostdiminishing
head
the
smell
is
that
of
citrus
malts
butter
grass
and
grain
the
taste
is
more
malty
than
expected
but
still
nicely
balanced
theres
a
nice
mild
initial
bitterness
that
gives
way
to
the
malt
sweetness
before
switching
back
to
a
dry
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
has
a
thinmedium
body
watery
texture
and
lively
carbonation
this
one
was
very
nicely
done
nothing
spectacular
here
but
a
good
wellrounded
pilsner
a
unique
beer
thats
certainly
worth
a
try
moderate
body
and
carbonation
make
for
a
great
session
beer
too
a
friend
happened
to
bring
over
a
sampler
pack
of
schell
i
made
the
mistake
of
trying
this
beer
it
pours
a
swill
gold
color
and
has
a
thin
head
it
had
weird
aromas
that
one
might
expect
from
a
adjunct
lager
that
sickly
corn
smell
i
did
not
expect
that
from
a
socalled
german
pilsener
the
flavor
was
even
worse
imho
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
can
of
beast
that
a
glass
of
pilsener
very
fine
pilsner
super
easy
to
enjoy

sigh
just
a
great
pilsner
malty
and
ripe
im
backed
up
on
entering
my
bottle
caps
into
beeradvocate
so
i
do
not
remember
the
specifics
on
why
i
put
staropramen
in
my
110
i
do
recall
generally
disliking
it
and
finding
essentially
no
redeeming
factors
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
unpretentious
but
very
good
beer
very
easy
to
drink
good
looking
appearance
nice
head
some
lace
smell
had
a
light
whiff
of
skunk
that
left
quickly
taste
is
malty
with
less
sharpness
from
the
herbal
hops
than
many
others
of
this
style
but
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
semi
dry
finish
carbonation
is
just
enough
overall
an
easy
drinking
lager
that
would
be
good
with
almost
any
type
of
meal
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
tend
to
enjoy
czech
beers
perhaps
its
the
smell
fresh
and
outdoorsy
theres
a
little
bitterness
to
it
which
i
like
this
is
beer
as
beer
should
be
not
that
watery
american
adjunct
lagers
that
we
all
have
to
drink
from
time
to
time
having
said
that
i
would
not
drink
this
as
my
lawnmower
beer
this
would
be
for
after
dinner
sitting
on
the
veranda
listening
to
the
crickets
on
a
spring
evening
after
the
first
mow
of
the
lawn
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
unless
there
are
no
other
choices
was
expecting
more
from
this
iconic
prague
beer
however
its
still
tasty
enough
overall

yeah
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
it
was
a
nice
chance
to
try
an
import
lager
these
are
for
sure
different
than
your
run
of
the
mill
american
lagers
good
all
around
lager
delicious
praguewater
budweiser
budvar
is
a
better
beer
mouthfeel
nothing
significant
to
report
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
easy
i
was
expecting
more
skunk
flavor
based
on
the
smell
however
it
is
actually
not
that
high
a
pretty
balanced
and
very
light
flavor
profile
which
is
typical
for
the
style
ive
got
a
great
local
option
of
czech
pilsner
from
raleigh
brewing
and
when
i
saw
this
one
at
the
store
i
figured
why
not
give
it
a
try
not
bad
could
be
better
and
i
expect
it
would
be
if
it
were
fresher
aka
in
prague
instead
of
being
shipped
here
i
think
ill
stick
with
my
local
option
but
a
good

mostly
of
malts
with
a
hint
of
floral
not
skunky
really
as
most
of
the
brews
that
come
in
a
green
bottle
for
some
reason
perfect
carbonation
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
the
malts
grains
breaddy
yeast
with
a
sweet
crisp
dry
finish
more
drinking
of
the
brew
brings
out
a
light
floral
taste
mixed
in
there
as
well
overall
a
decent
brew
golden
yellow
in
color
with
an
amber
hue
poured
with
a
short
fizzy
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
bready
and
caramel
malt
aromas
are
dominant
with
faint
herbal
hop
and
buttery
notes
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
oily
feel
up
front
followed
by
a
light
tangy
feel
through
the
middle
burnt
caramel
and
bready
malt
flavors
up
front
followed
by
light
herbal
hop
flavors
that
try
very
hard
to
produce
a
crisp
snap
that
this
style
is
known
for
but
it
falls
a
bit
short
finishes
with
bready
caramel
malt
aftertaste
i
really
like
it
theres
actually
a
little
harshness
i
wasnt
expecting
that
kind
of
builds
up
at
the
back
of
the
throat
its
not
astringent
exactly
it
just
bites
a
little
surprisingly
though
it
doesnt
detract
too
much
from
the
mouthfeel
of
an
otherwise
nice
crisp
lightbodied
brew
overall
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
smells
and
taste
great
a
pleasure
to
drink
will
definitely
be
trying
this
one
again
12oz
pint
glass
nothing
spectacular
here
but
a
good
solid
old
world
pilsner
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
either
rather
straight
forward
and
simple
wont
stand
out
also
was
rather
surprising
how
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
it
was
while
i
may
never
seek
it
out
again
for
me
may
make
a
great
gateway
beer
for
an
adjunct
drinker
i
have
i
thing
great
to
say
about
it
and
nothing
bad
a
very
good
maltforward
pilsner
easy
to
drink
with
good
balance
and
decent
complexity
there
is
a
brightness
and
crispness
to
the
beer
overall
along
with
a
gentle
warmth
yet
still
remains
light
and
refreshing
mouth
heavily
carbonated
as
most
pilsners
light
and
effervescent
on
the
tongue
lighter
in
terms
of
body
i
think
the
elements
of
this
beverage
which
make
it
a
beer
are
fighting
to
the
death
with
carbonated
water
for
dominance
over
the
flavour
instead
of
working
together
right
now
the
water
has
the
upper
hand
its
not
bad
but
strikes
me
as
nothing
more
than
the
exportquality
macro
brew
one
would
expect
to
find
among
the
foreign
beers
in
bulgaria
these
days
i
really
would
have
liked
it
more
if
there
were
more
hops
for
me
it
would
have
gone
from
okay
to
nice
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
others
that
are
certainly
better
representatives
of
the
czech
republic
and
its
important
heritage
for
these
reasons
i
cannot
rate
this
one
much
better
than
average
overall
on
tap
here
in
bru
in
phily
enjoyable
and
reminiscent
of
a
fabulous
trip
through
central
europe
o
decent
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
euro
lager
with
a
bit
of
character
overall
a
good
if
not
great
pilsner
certainly
enjoyable
but
nothing
stands
out
to
separate
from
others
t
wheaty
light
hops
clean
and
soapy
good
carbonation
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
lager
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
it
would
be
fine
as
a
session
beer
d
was
expecting
a
less
bold
more
universal
flavor
and
was
quite
surprised
by
the
character
of
this
beer
this
was
an
okay
beer
but
i
think
the
hop
profile
could
more
pronounced
overall
probably
my
favorite
lager
with
summerfest
close
behind
basically
its
a
macro
made
the
way
it
should
be
with
some
actual
flavor
characteristics
very
smooth
and
refreshing
also
if
you
are
ever
in
prague
visit
the
brewery
and
try
this
on
draft
its
amazing
rjt
o
overall
a
decent
beer
with
a
solid
backbone
well
worth
the
money
the
pils
has
a
taste
that
is
mineral
and
toasted
with
slight
creamy
element
from
yeast
and
possibly
carbonation
with
subtle
yeast
dryness
after
the
swallow
with
some
spiciness
from
the
hops
in
the
finish
overall
i
was
bit
underwhelmed
as
the
beer
was
overwhelmed
by
the
skunkiness
it
suffers
a
lot
as
a
result
of
this
and
is
marginally
drinkable
as
a
result
i
would
pass
unless
i
saw
it
on
tap
somewhere
its
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
had
but
its
certainly
nowhere
near
the
best
even
for
a
czech
beer
fairly
easy
to
drink
if
you
can
get
past
the
smell
and
lack
of
flavor
not
amazing
but
worth
a
drink
or
two
o
i
should
have
stopped
drinking
this
after
a
couple
of
sips
but
i
hoped
it
would
get
better
it
didnt
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
overall
im
a
little
out
of
my
element
i
would
imagine
this
is
a
descent
pilsner
i
would
enjoy
it
as
such
my
bmc
frame
of
reference
would
tell
me
that
it
is
better
than
all
of
those
its
like
a
light
lager
with
a
better
hop
character
and
a
better
mouthfeel
it
is
definitely
less
filling
than
a
lot
of
things
i
have
been
drinking
lately
i
would
in
fact
have
another
i
would
drink
it
as
a
lawnmower
beer
or
i
could
se
myself
ordering
it
in
an
airport
leaving
prague
pours
a
clear
pale
orange
with
some
light
red
at
the
light
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
lingers
for
a
few
seconds
and
clears
off
leaving
a
thin
line
of
lace
around
the
circumference
of
the
glass
aroma
consists
of
caramel
lemon
orange
and
a
hint
of
dry
grass
and
is
quite
robust
for
a
lager
theres
no
skunkfunk
to
speak
of
very
dry
and
crisp
with
a
splash
of
lemon
on
top
of
some
grain
some
orange
peel
is
also
noticed
add
to
all
that
a
little
sweet
mixed
with
a
little
bitter
and
easy
as
sunday
morning
all
the
way
to
the
finish
o
not
very
pilsner
like
to
me
a
little
more
euro
lager
for
my
taste
not
bad
if
you
a
thirsty

bready
pale

bitterness
mostly

a
little

finish
off

soft
carbonation
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on

of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the

on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt

and
a
sweetened
corn
flake
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
grassy
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
czech
pilsners
are
among
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
i
wish
that
more
of
ones
that
are
available
in
my
area
did
justice
to
the
style
as
pilsner
urquell
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
thought
i
would
give
this
czech
beer
a
try
it
has
a
brassy
body
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
big
pure
white
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
in
line
with
a
bud
or
pbr
but
a
bit
more
upscale
the
malts
have
more
interesting
layering
and
likewise
the
hop
finish
is
more
complex
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
along
the
lines
of
a
pbr
but
with
some
more
sophistication
this
is
a
good
option
o
overall
a
below
average
pilsner
not
a
lot
going
on
here
and
has
some
of
that
sweet
corn
and
vegetable
notes
that
reminds
me
of
an
adjunct
lager
body
is
thin
you
could
have
a
few
of
them
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
cheers
overall
a
decent
if
unremarkable
pilsner
i
bet
this
would
taste
great
on
vacation
in
prague
pours
avery
run
of
th
emill
golden
pilsner
color
with
nice
head
and
typical
pilsner
aromas
nothing
special
here
taste
is
very
nice
crisp
maybe
even
slight
sweetness
going
on
here
but
its
a
czech
pils
a
good
one
but
still
lack
luster
in
personality
nice
brew
with
some
noodles
and
worth
the
5
relatively
low
cost
for
a
stockholm
restaurant
a
pretty
standard
lager
taste
and
aroma
are
ok
but
dont
stand
out
from
the
crowd
the
dryness
is
quite
pleasing
not
the
greatest
czech
pilsner
but
drinkable
enough
grab
some
for
a
warm
day
o
nothing
special
an
ordinary
beer
for
ordinary
people
i
would
buy
again
overall
i
expected
more
but
this
is
your
typically
skunky
greenbottled
pilsner
i
e
pilsner
urquell
great
on
a
warm
summer
day
not
too
different
from
many
other
pilseners
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
the
nas
its
simple
sure
but
it
really
is
a
beer
that
must
be
taken
for
what
it
is
there
are
more
complex
beers
out
there
but
this
is
perfectly
refreshing
on
its
own
or
accompanied
with
any
meal
a
great
beer
proving
the
saying
that
less
is
more
this
poured
a
crystal
golden
color
light
aroma
some
grassy
hops
has
a
clear
crisp
flavor
the
czech
saaz
hops
are
bright
and
noticible
and
it
finishes
clean
and
crisp
this
is
not
a
bad
pils
in
the
leastmore
like
ok
in
the
time
it
took
from
writing
this
review
to
posting
it
i
forgot
all
about
it
if
thats
any
indication
of
its
staying
power
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
there
wasnt
much
lacing
or
retention
on
this
one
the
smell
was
earthy
with
some
hints
of
cut
grass
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
decent
malt
base
with
a
light
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
light
nicely
carbonated
and
crisp
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
i
liked
it
more
than
some
of
the
others
in
the
style
still
not
one
id
buy
a
case
of
or
anything
but
glad
i
tried
it
o
actually
enjoyable
the
skunk
aspect
really
isnt
all
too
bad
there
was
enough
going
on
in
the
beer
to
keep
me
interested
and
my
mind
off
the
skunk
one
of
the
better
usual
suspects
a
fairly
nondescript
brew
but
easily
drinkable
and
sessionable
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
tastepilsner
malt
muted
hop
note
more
evident
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
a
letdown
for
a
czech
pilsener
seems
more
in
the
american
pilsner
type
if
saaz
hops
are
in
use
here
they
dont
make
their
presence
known
overall
quaffable
on
a
hot
day
but
average
at
best
o
enjoyable
a
solid
pilsener
pretty
simple
which
sometimes
is
exactly
what
you
want
o
everything
you
could
want
in
a
czech
pils
aside
from
the
green
bottle
curse
nothing
special
here
a
slightly
sweet
malty
aroma
after
a
golden
flat
color
with
almost
no
head
flavor
is
straw
grassy
hop
and
a
wole
bunch
of
czech
malt
flavors
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
clean
not
as
crisp
as
some
and
totally
sucks
when
it
warms
this
beer
doesnt
do
it
for
me
easy
drinking
but
enexciting
weak
as
the
czechs
go
i
dont
know
better
than
a

thats
about
all
i
can

thats
a

whatsoever
not
the
best
pils
i
have
ever
had
but
up
there
with
some
of
the
imported
versions
very
drinkable
the
16
9
ounce
bottles
dont
last
very
long
the
type
of
beer
that
im
sure
appeals
to
the
masses
in
praha
staropramen
im
guessing
star
of
prague
o
a
classic
that
hits
all
the
classic
bohemian
pils
flavors
but
overall
there
is
nothing
special
still
an
old
reliable
i
love
a
good
czech
pils
and
when
i
see
them
ontap
i
almost
always
order
them
this
one
however
had
something
wrong
with
it
o
a
good
pilsner
that
of
course
would
be
better
fresh
from
the
sourcebut
still
its
nice
to
drink
a
true
pilsner
every
once
in
a
while
pale
golden

just
over

to
be
desired
nice
and
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
enjoyable
even
if
it
is
a
little
one
dimensional
and
simple
but
sometimes
that
is
all
you
are
looking
for
overall
nothing
special
but
a
nice
refreshing
drink
overall
its
a
pretty
average
pilsner
that
tastes
better
than
it
smells
and
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
there
are
better
pilsners
out
there
but
its
a
clean
yet
unremarkable
pilsner
drinkability
it
is
not
going
to
blow
one
away
with
its
complexity
but
it
is
a
very
tasty
pilsner
that
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
exemplifies
the
style
malt
over
hops
until
it
loses
quite
a
lot
of
chill
which
is
not
to
style
for
czech
pils
i
wonder
if
that
has
to
do
with
the
maltose
syrup
i
see
in
the
ingredient
list
but
the
body
is
right
there
and
its
not
unpleasant
quality
lager
at
least
ill
admit
that
i
often
finds
pilsners
to
be
rather
blah
but
this
one
stands
out
from
the
pack
in
being
especially
dull
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
i
have
few
positive
things
to
say
about
it
o
tastes
like
a
typical
mass
produced
pilsener
nothing
particularly
interesting
about
this
one
o
a
pretty
good
czech
pilsner
and
im
sure
its
better
in
prague
stop
with
the
green
bottles
please
it
stopped
me
from
buying
this
for
years
until
i
finally
found
a
single
o
being
a
self
admitted
pilsener
lover
i
have
to
wonder
if
im
running
into
a
wall
of
taste
here
its
my
favorite
beer
but
it
seems
as
though
its
a
tad
one
dimensional
you
could
line
5
of
them
up
at
varying
price
points
and
id
be
hard
pressed
to
name
two
of
the
five
blind
time
to
switch
it
up
i
suppose
i
dont
even
see
the
word
lager
on
this
beer
o
this
was
underwhelming
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
this
beer
the
staleness
and
low
carbonation
just
dont
do
it
for
me
d
reasonably
priced
for
an
imported
beer
but
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
overall
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
staropramen
other
than
classic
i
rank
this
up
there
with
pilsner
urquell
and
golden
pheasant
i
will
definitely
buy
again
a
solid
nonjudgmental
beer
dark
gold
with
a
light
copper
glow
lets
me
know
there
is
more
than
pils
malt
in
this
one
big
whiff
of
skunk
overwhelms
all
else
grass
clipping
hoppiness
peaks
through
but
malt
is
thin
and
cant
stand
up
to
the
green
bottle
curse
even
if
this
had
been
deskunked
it
wouldnt
have
been
close
to
the
czech
pilsener
style
more
in
line
with
the
average
euro
pale
lager
i
would
take
semifresh
urquell
over
this
which
isnt
saying
much
staropramen
pours
a
totally
clear
strawgold
hue
and
is
topped
with
a
small
but
sudsy
cap
of
froth
the
nose
is
lightly
spicy
and
somehow
suggests
an
intangible
mealy
essence
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
offering
very
crisp
and
clean
mineral
notes
husky
grain
a
light
floral
nuance
and
a
herbalearthy
bitterness
upon
the
finish
the
feel
is
quite
nice
as
well
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
damn
solid
pils
very
clear
golden
body
that
exhibits
little
effervescence
gets
topped
by
midsized
lasting
dense
white
head
aroma
is
rich
malted
barley
and
floralspicy
noble
hops
with
traces
of
diacetyl
the
maltaroma
is
somewhat
biscuity
toastlike
with
almost
melanoidin
qualities
which
probably
results
from
decoction
mashing
the
beer
is
crispy
yet
smooth
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
with
tonguecoating
diacetyl
that
enhances
the
perception
of
body
giving
it
additional
fullness
the
complex
pale
malt
is
counterbalanced
by
prominent
yet
soft
well
rounded
nonlingering
bitterness
brought
in
by
spicy
noble
hops
good
one
my
impression
is
that
the
czech
beers
brewed
for
domestic
consumption
always
differ
from
their
export
versions
and
staropramen
is
no
exception
with
its
fuller
palate
and
richer
matcharacter

a
c
staropramen
lager
is
a
decent
pilsener
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
consider
it
an
especially
memorable
example
of
the
style
ive
had
this
many
times
before
and
will
probably
return
to
it
again
at
some
point
but
if
push
came
to
shove
there
are
several
other
czechstyle
beers
pilsner
urquell
golden
pheasant
etc
that
id
definitely
pick
first
if
youre
just
a
fan
of
euro
lagers
and
are
looking
for
a
cheap
passable
pilsener
to
slug
back
this
stuff
will
get
the
job
done
but
serious
lager
fans
will
probably
find
staropramen
to
be
a
fairly
forgettable
offering
a
serviceable
boring
lager
that
is
worth
at
least
one
try
if
only
because
of
the
price
point
overall
nice
balanced
pilsner
a
smooth
tasting
lager
slightly
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
sharp
start
smooth
finish
average
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
to
have
again
overall
not
the
most
interesting
beer
light
refreshing
a
little
weak
in
taste
and
aroma
though
wish
these
were
a
little
more
available
they
arent
bad
in
julyaugust
but
they
are
a
little
pricey
for
what
you
get
overy
good
authentic
pilsner
it
remind
me
on
best
helles
lagers
i
triedor
is
it
opposite
overall
this
is
an
unbelievable
beer
yes
it
is
much
better
on
tap
but
the
500ml
bottle
is
also
excellent
i
reckon
this
is
the
best
of
the
three
main
czech
pilsners
onothing
special
and
not
a
particularly
good
example
of
the
style
cheers
half
litre
bottle
not
too
much
of
a
head
very
nice
colour
looks
almost
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
smells
of
saaz
also
got
hints
of
red
cabbage
sweeter
than
other
czech
beers
probably
because
of
the
syrup
hints
of
flowers
not
much
bitterness
nice
mouthfull
for
a
lager
this
was
my
goto
before
i
really
got
into
exploring
different
beers
and
i
still
drink
it
on
occasions
picked
up
a
single
at
euromarket
the
beer
is
immediately
hoppy
but
true
to
style
its
a
soft
bite
with
herbal
lemon
hops
theres
an
unfortunate
cheap
lager
note
maybe
fusels
mixed
without
an
otherwise
pleasant
floral
note
the
aroma
is
disappointingly
bland
but
the
flavor
has
that
classic
mellow
bread
and
earthy
hops
not
a
bad
hotweather
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
eurobeers
available
in
my
area
its
very
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
malty
and
mildly
hoppy
taste
id
drink
it
again
an
ok
runner
up
if
you
need
a
bitburger
and
their
isnt
a
german
pils
in
sight
330

theres

but
nothing
really
special
malty

medium
body
and
tastes
of
malts
although
theres
dome
hops
bitterness
flowery
and
a
hint
of
honey
its
not
bad
but
its
not
much
interesting
either
and
of
course
not
the
best
of
the
czech
beers
pale

on

and
loads
of
sticky
and
trailing

mingles
with
dried
spicy
saaz
hops
a
mild
malt
aroma
is
in
the
background
throughout
a
very
lightly
roasted
slightly
sweet
maltiness
gives
way
to
sharp
edgy
metallic
and
resinous
hop
bitterness
very
drinkable
brew
staropramen
premium
lager
is
sparkling
clear
and
golden
with
a
thin
creamy
blotchy
white
head
that
leaves
outstanding
lacing
it
has
a
funky
aroma
fruity
and
grassy
its
pretty
light
bodied
and
quite
smooth
with
a
little
grit
in
the
finish
theres
not
much
flavor
at
all
just
a
touch
of
funk
and
a
lightly
bitter
finish
it
has
a
lingering
herbal
bitterness
this
doesnt
taste
that
great
but
it
goes
down
smoothly
the
lingering
bitterness
lets
me
know
im
drinking
beer
d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
pure
crisp
czech
pils
not
bad
d
quite
high
but
after
one
or
two
id
probably
lose
interest
and
move
on
to
something
more
exciting
that
said
a
very
drinkable
refreshing
little
pilz
served
into
a
lowenbrau
pint
glass
from
a
500

can
gives
a
small
white
foamy
head
with
some
mild
lacing
it
is
a
medium
golden
color
smells
slightly
sweet
a
little
metallic
and
malty
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
and
malty
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
and
carbonated
drinkability
is
fine
probably
even
better
ice
cold
on
the
beach
but
ill
have
to
wait
a
few
more
months
for
that
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
will
not
be
buying
it
again
d
okay
drinkability
here
although
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
wont
be
trying
it
again
good
two

of
moderate

like

color
is
a

on
the

and
just
a

cloudy
smells
of
mild
wet

i
detect
flavors
of
wheat
hops
malt
nothing
special
here
but
not
a
real
bad
taste
has
some
body
as
it
flows
over
my
tongue
i
dont
think
i
will
have
another
one
of
these
but
it
was
worth
the
experience
of
tasting
it
visit
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
for
more
beer
reviews
a
very
drinkable
simple
beer
here
hops
are
well
done
in
this
pils
pretty
cheap
for
an
imported
quality
brew
as
well
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
quite
drinkable
drinkability
id
certainly
have
it
again
ive
seen
some
pubs
here
in
galway
the
cellar
that
have
it
on
tap
im
going
to
give
it
a
try
ive
always
enjoyed
pilseners
and
this
one
is
a
treat
especially
at
this
price
range
reminds
me
of
pilsner
urquell
but
seemed
a
little
less
smooth
to
me
although
it
had
more
interesting
flavors
left
me
with
an
exceptional
aftertaste
which
made
me
want
another
sip
after
i
finished
my
last
d
decent
beer
but
for
me
it
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
pack
drinkability
these
go
down
way
too
easy
the
smooth
toasted
grain
finish
makes
it
hard
to
set
this
down
its
quite
drinkable
without
having
any
rich
complex
flavours
to
speak
about
good
but
only
if
your
primary
objective
is
to
urgently
quench
your
thirst
d
very
drinkable
but
forgettable
not
a
lot
of
depth
here
not
a
bad
czech
beer
just
not
one
of
the
greats
drinkability
is
good
nothing
special
but
easy
to
drink
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
type
but
not
one
of
the
top
lagers
to
come
from
this
area
much
better
varieties
id
look
for
first
d
a
fairly
decent
pils
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
would
probably
go
with
the
original
over
this
one
but
it
is
still
worth
trying
just
to
see
whats
out
there
medium
body
mediumlow
carbonation
could
be
a
bit
higher
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
malt
richness
and
severe
lack
of
hops
for
the
style
not
particularly
drinkable
though
on
a
hot
day
like
today
id
have
no
trouble
finishing
one
gold
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
hint
of
skunkiness
taste
is
grainy
and
sweet
with
a
tad
of
butter
overall
pretty
bland
and
boring
not
horrible
but
not
great
either
i
dont
think
youll
be
missing
much
if
you
never
try
this
this
is
my
last
one
for
sure
d
in
a
style
that
excels
here
this
definitely
disappoints
it
doesnt
have
the
body
or
flavor
that
makes
pilsners
so
good
this
seems
like
a
decent
czech
pilsner
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
simple
and
refreshing
with
all
of
the
usual
going
on
a
decent
intro
into
the
style
but
not
a
standout
pours
a
clear
bright
pale
straw
with
a
solid
two
fingers
of
white
frothy
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
singed
rice
and
wheat
with
a
dark
bit
of
funk
very
much
like
the
colorsake
sure
its
a
word
trust
me
feed
doused
with
water
and
left
to
malinger
in
the
sun
the
taste
follows
but
with
an
added
dose
of
negativity
as
though
this
brew
were
fighting
your
tongue
for
no
apparent
reason
and
not
showering
for
a
week
beforehand
yes
that
kind
of
salty
musk
is
involved
here
the
body
to
its
credit
is
nicely
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
texture
helping
to
salvage
the
drinkability
from
the
absolute
abyss
ed
harris
came
down
just
in
time
but
it
is
a
shame
it
is
an
ab
product
but
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
czech
pilseners
d
very
drinkable
beer
at
5
a
pint
was
a
bit
much
for
lunch
made
me
sleepy
walking
around
the
museum
afterwards
hehe
d
good
drinkability
classic
pilsener
this
is
a
solid
choice
almost
every
time
well
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
a
good
session
especially
here
in
bg
in
all
a
very
decent
czech
lager
poured
from
a
green
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
taste
is
crisp
some
sweetness
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
lager
with
a
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
immediately
medium
carbonation
smells
of
hay
and
straw
your
typical
euro
pilslager
tastes
a
like
a
pils
with
a
little
zesty
spring
flavor
a
little
of
that
heinekin
style
skunk
flavor
heavier
than
average
carbonation
light
crisp
mouthfeel
this
is
what
i
would
consider
a
session
beer
worth
a
try
well
ill
try
any
beer
once
in
this
case
some
christmas
presents
to
uncork
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
upon
popping
the
cap
there
is
a
distinctly
european
lager
smell
extremely
sweet
and
dry
pours
into
a
pint
with
a
nice
112
finger
macrobubble
head
topping
a
very
bubbly
bright
orangish
yellow
brew
taste
is
most
definitely
characteristic
of
a
european
pilsener
almost
a
straight
barley
and
cornlike
taste
comes
through
the
beer
which
a
has
good
body
and
slight
bitterness
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
the
whole
taste
disappears
leaving
a
dry
and
clean
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
in
the
warm
sofla
winter
sun
and
knock
back
however
since
its
nightfall
and
a
little
chilly
this
beer
is
a
little
too
light
for
the
bonfire
all
and
all
this
is
a
fairly
good
pilsner
and
for
the
cost
its
not
bad
having
one
or
two
on
hand
just
make
sure
you
get
to
them
i
prefer
urquell
but
its
not
bad
to
pick
this
one
up
not
bad
but
it
wont
blow
you
away
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
very
very
well
carbonated
and
although
theres
nothing
all
that
special
about
it
its
definitely
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
d
easy
drinking
abv
is
on
target
with
easy
sessioning
flavors
are
well
integrated
less
filling
good
overall
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
forms
a
1
inch
head
that
leaves
fair
lacing
the
appearance
is
crystal
clear
and
light
amber
the
aroma
is
of
light
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
moderately
malty
with
some
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
not
altogether
terrible
for
a
massproduced
brew
from
the
czech
republics
second
largest
brewery
a
little
malty
a
little
bitter
a
little
skunky
and
youre
done
drinkability
easy
drinking
lager
that
is
better
than
most
of
the
international
lagers
it
competes
against
but
probably
only
average
in
terms
of
czech
pilsners
this
is
very
drinkable
actually
im
surprised
quite
refreshing
exceptionally
picturesque
brilliant
frosty
pale
pilsner
gold
with
a
surge
bubbles
coalescing
into
a
perfect
puffy

mild
aroma
of
sweet
bread
and
aromatic
strikingly
basillike
herbal
hops
with
a
touch
of
pine
crisp
citric
hops
clench
the
dry
balanced
flavor
full
of
honey
lemon
and
wet
grains
carbonation
is
spritzy
and
light
appropriately
fizzy
but
not
rough
very
refreshing
and
robust
i
like
this
one
floral
hops
and
kind
light
malt
profile
it
seems
like
they
only
used
one
kind
of
hop
as
this
beer
lacks
complexity
that
being
said
its
really
robust
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
thin
enough
its
traditional
and
also
very
drinkable
this
is
how
i
imagined
beer
as
a
kid
the
look
the
taste
and
the
smell
still
its
very
humble
and
traditional
and
also
tasty
d
a
very
nice
czech
pilsener
this
is
a
must
very
drinkable
easy
but
flavorful
quaffing
d
drinks
quite
well
with
clean
pretty
characteristics
ill
be
honest
and
admit
that
i
only
really
bought
this
because
it
was
from
prague
and
i
once
had
a
wonderful
trip
there
many
years
ago
it
turns
out
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
dont
get
why
this
is
a
b
beer
im
drinking
it
in
ireland
though
maybe
it
doesnt
handle
its
journey
to
america
well
tastes
very
much
like
budweiser
budvar
not
as
hoppy
as
pilsner
urquell
but
as
clean
its
got
a
great
golden
triple
decocted
taste
like
a
real
czech
pilsner
should
have
it
smells
great
no
skunk
and
tastes
very
refreshing
and
clean
im
really
enjoying
this
after
a
9
to
9
day
well
done
now
to
find
it
in
america
staropramen
poured
a
full
gold
with
a
small
white
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
was
faint
with
hints
of
hops
and
malt
taste
had
nice
sweet
malt
up
front
followed
by
some
nice
bitter
hop
notes
mouthfeel
was
good
for
the
style
drinkability
was
good
as
well
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
beer
for

would
purchase
again

not
a

tasty
overall
id
call
it
average
not
quite
enough
taste
character
but
not
bad
either
d
very
mild
and
drinkable
i
would
love
to
taste
this
side
by
side
with
its
draft
version
if
there
is
one
to
see
if
it
is
skunked
i
need
to
conduct
an
experiment
and
intentionally
skunk
a
beer
to
get
a
handle
on
the
flavor
this
would
go
well
with
a
mild
fish
or
anything
that
wouldnt
crush
the
flavor
mouthfeel
pretty
thin
and
carbonation
is
medium
and
sharp
fours
across
the
board
overall
good
uh
ps
the
label
is
much
cooler
than
the
one
shown
here
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
decent
flavouring
and
character
not
my
first
choice
of
a
czech
pilsner
but
nothing
wrong
with
having
a
few
of
these
overall
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
world
of
czech
pilseners
which
might
encourage
drinkers
to
try
pilsner
urquell
and
other
strong
pilseners
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
how
anyone
could
not
like
this
beer
this
staropramen
edition
comes
in
a
green
bottle
about
8
months
fresh
appearance
is
dark
amber
smell
is
maybe
just
above
average
with
a
semiskunky
aroma
at
first
taste
is
good
i
can
taste
the
hops
and
it
seems
very
fresh
mouthfeel
is
a
disappointment
i
still
have
that
skunky
taste
but
it
goes
down
fairly
smooth
drinkability
is
overall
good
good
as
far
as
czech
pilsners
but
not
superior
to
my
favorites
of
the
german
variety
a
fairly
good
brew
my
experience
having
lagers
in
poland
weißbier
in
germany
and
fresh
hop
harvest
ales
in
california
has
also
taught
me
that
beers
can
be
unfathomably
better
when
served
as
fresh
and
as
close
to
the
source
as
possible
by
my
own
admission
ive
yet
to
have
a
real
czech
pilsner
at
its
best
ill
have
to
stop
wasting
money
on
these
crappy
cans
and
start
saving
up
poured
a
golden
colour
with
a
small
head
that
disappeared
almost
instantaneously
it
smelled
very
hoppy
sweet
and
fruity
has
a
sweet
citrussy
flavour
with
a
bit
of
bite
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
should
have
bought
more
d
this
one
goes
down
easy
enough
a
great
summer
day
beer
not
a
bad
pilsener
id
rather
have
it
in
a
brown
bottle
though
to
see
what
a
nonlight
struck
beer
would
be
like
m
and
d
slight
carbonation
which
i
like
too
much
carbonation
spoils
the
experience
for
me
not
too
much
of
an
alcohol
taste
a
nice
smooth
lager
very
drinkable
especially
at
backyard
bbqs
aroma
is
crisp
fairly
strong
and
malty
typical
of
a
lager
color
is
a
nice
orangygold
amber
with
a
very
thick
but
none
too
persistent
white
head
flavor
is
typically
lagerish
mainly
malty
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
and
just
a
hint
of
fruit
texture
is
smooth
and
thick
almost
syrupy
happily
different
from
so
many
lagers
that
come
across
as
thin
and
watery
light
amber
and
strong
hay
colored
brew
great
column
of
bubling
just
lacking
in
th
head
and
foam
department
crisp
grass
and
pilsner
malt
aroma
super
crisp
hops
and
super
dry
pilsner
malts
make
this
czech
beers
crisp
and
somewhat
bitter
palate
make
this
one
sessionable
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
tart
and
the
drinkability
is
good
though
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
flavor
structure
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
recipe
or
execution
its
just
not
one
of
my
favorite
combinations
certainly
a
far
stride
away
from
the
better
czech
pilsners
this
one
seemed
more
like
a
slighly
hoppy
euro
pale
lager
drank
alright
would
only
try
again
if
i
knew
it
was
fresh
i
had
my
doubts
about
this
one
poured
into
my
souvenir
staropramen
50cl
mug
from
a
pub
in
the
backstreets
of
prague
whose
name
i
dont
remember
this
pilsener
is
a
very
nice
light
golden
colour
with
a
copious
amount
of
light
white
head
which
disappears
quickly
leaving
lace
all
over
the
place
the
smell
takes
me
back
to
those
dark
cool
pubs
near
the
strahov
stadium
taking
refuge
in
wonderful
50
cent
frosty
beer
noenglish
environments
its
all
bready
biscuity
malt
and
grassy
green
hops
on
the
nose
and
crisp
hops
and
white
crackers
in
the
taste
very
easy
to
drink
moderately
carbonated
with
a
clean
finish
im
not
saying
this
can
is
as
good
as
a
pint
in
a
prague
pub
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
so
this
will
have
to
do
and
do
nicely
i
loved
in
czech
for
6
months
and
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
i
worked
in
a
bar
and
we
served
it
great
example
of
a
fine
pilsner
i
tried
back
in
the
us
and
i
would
have
to
say
its
not
the
same
but
still
a
great
beer
its
my
favorite
of
all
the
czech
pilsners
deep
gold
to
amber
clear
and
bubbly
with
a
nice
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
left
a
bit
of
foam
lace
on
the
glass
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
skunk
too
but
only
fleeting
taste
is
malty
sweet
a
bit
grassy
with
a
nice
fruity
hops
flavor
that
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
a
decent
balance
and
not
bad
for
the
style
mouthfeel
felt
a
little
deadpancould
have
done
with
more
carbonation
given
the
style
however
in
saying
that
i
found
the
drinkability
to
be
easy
like
your
run
of
the
mill
mainstream
import
safe
enough
to
want
more
that
lingering
bitterness
was
inviting
this
is
a
good
solid
easy
drinking
beer
the
flavors
of
hops
and
malt
are
in
good
balance
a
slightly
darker
golden
color
than
one
expects
from
a
pils
pours
with
a
finger
or
two
of
head
and
leaves
a
farily
delicate
lace
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
staropramen
is
a
great
choice
for
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
those
who
appreciate
quality
beer
and
those
who
are
happy
with
whatever
is
cold
drinkability
is
poor
this
is
what
i
get
for
going
for
exotic
european
beers
without
investigating
first
maybe
i
was
expecting
a
150
year
old
recipe
while
it
is
not
a
beer
to
hunt
down
feavourishly
in
expectation
of
lager
revelation
it
is
a
decent
pint
with
the
lads
on
a
friday
afternoon
overall
not
a
bad
choice
but
probably
better
ontap
in
germany
or
better
yet
the
czech
republic
to
me
pilsner
urquell
is
a
better
experience
if
were
talking
bottles
need
to
find
out
what
its
like
fresh
from
the
barrel
d
this
beer
definitely
grows
on
you
definitely
good
for
a
pilsener
d
not
impressed
overall
here
at
times
was
a
turnoff
and
at
others
though
it
had
some
good
crispness
to
it
but
still
i
struggled
to
find
a
reason
to
finish
this
and
have
to
give
this
a
pass
and
dont
bother
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
nice
and
smooth
on
the
palate
crisp
clean
and
light
as
well
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
very
nice
on
a
hot
day
i
can
see
it
complimenting
a
wide
variety
of
foods
this
is
one
ill
probably
not
buy
again
any
time
soon
i
know
that
there
are
much
better
out
there
i
am
however
glad
to
have
tried
this
brew
overall
this
is
just
run
of
the
mill
average
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
little
fullness
from
carbonation
but
good
enough
taste
id
deal
with
it
crystal
clear
amber
body
with
average
head
which
quickly
dissipates
but
leaves
solid
lacing
very
strong
skunky
aroma
with
some
graininess
in
the
background
taste
switches
those
more
graininess
with
a
slightly
skunky
finish
light
mouthfeel
with
relatively
high
carbonation
drinkable
but
im
personally
not
a
big
fan
of
the
skunkiness

never

somewhat
refreshing
but
not
quite
so
much
as
some
other
czech
pilsners
md
is
quite
fizzy
and
light
one
step
above
water
much
less
there
than
i
would
hope
for
seems
much
more
like
a
stereotypical
cheap
american
macro
lager
than
anything
selfrespecting
pilsner
should
be
although
its
light
and
crispy
leaves
a
bitter
stickiness
on
the
finish
overall
impression
drinkable
and
interesting
a
nice
example
of
an
often
overlooked
style
i
find
these
czech
pilseners
to
be
more
and
more
of
the
same
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
for
my
preferance
drinkability
is
very
easy
to
swallow
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
slight
breadlike
aroma
it
appears
to
be
all
malt
and
has
a
light
czech
hop
presence
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
plainbland
pilsner
malt
flavor
the
hops
are
there
but
dont
stand
out
only
in
the
finish
its
clean
with
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
a
breadlike
character
and
some
mild
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
drinker
although
i
find
it
a
bit
heavy
for
a
czech
pils
it
should
be
lighter
with
a
more
pronounced
hop
character
all
in
all
not
bad
drinkable
probably
better
with
food
than
to
sit
down
and
sip
it
nothing
too
special
here
though
simple
clean
and
refreshing
no
skunk
to
worry
about
here
knowing
its
from
a
keg
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
much
of
the
taste
was
like
bittersweet
more
sweet
than
bitter
honey
and
a
light
dose
of
hops
ontap
it
makes
a
grrreeeat
session
beer
at
a
restaurant
while
chatting
with
friends
d
not
bad
at
all
but
the
carbonation
kind
of
gets
in
the
way
of
prolonged
consumption
d
pretty
good
actually
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
and
it
certainly
has
some
refining
characteristics
to
it
although
the
abv
is
low
i
cant
see
making
this
a
bbq
beer
or
anything
but
one
or
two
with
dinner
would
probably
work
very
well
worth
a
try
a
nice
hoppy
lager
clean
and
flavorful
final
statement
not
a
mindblowing
beer
but
very
drinkable
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
a
decent
czech
pilsner
not
a
bad
lager
but
not
near
the
best
pours
a
pretty
gold
color
with
an
average
head
has
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
as
well
has
a
strong
skunk
smell
to
it
with
corn
in
the
aromas
as
well
no
hop
or
malt
smell
that
really
stands
out
taste
is
average
another
boring
lager
really
little
body
to
it
or
unique
taste
seems
hard
to
make
a
lager
stand
out
mouthfeel
is
watery
its
an
average
beer
i
suppose
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
very
bland
and
cheaply
made
fields
of
golden
barley
gold
no
head
my
fault
aroma
of
wide
open
fields
of
wheat
and
barley
as
experienced
on
many
a
rural
european
beer
hike
tastes
like
good
clean
pilsner
malt
soft
fresh
bread
slightly
toasty
there
is
a
little
hop
bite
on
the
finish
which
by
the
way
tastes
like
more
of
those
damp
grainy
fields
of
beersoaked
country
hikes
in
obscure
locales
if
i
had
weened
myself
on
imperial
stouts
barleywines
and
double
ipas
then
i
suppose
i
too
would
find
regular
workhorse
lagers
to
be
bland
and
boring
but
i
would
also
be
a
lot
younger
less
experienced
and
well
narrow
minded
fellows
when
you
go
from
bud
light
to
olympia
to
german
pils
and
then
czech
pils
you
just
dont
forget
it
you
can
take
all
the
next
ten
years
to
get
into
belgian
tripels
quadrupels
lambics
and
west
coast
ipas
but
you
will
never
forget
that
first
girl
you
fell
in
love
with
decent
lager
nuttin
outstanding
but
still
quite
quaffable
except
the
import
costs
puts
this
out
of
the
everyday
drinking
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
goldenstraw
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
biscuits
with
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
but
it
is
quite
faint
the
taste
is
even
more
faint
than
the
aroma
with
only
a
slight
hint
of
bready
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
nothing
really
bad
about
this
beer
but
there
is
nothing
good
about
it
either
i
cannot
see
myself
drinking
this
again
mediumgold
colour
but
see
through
light
head
some
lacing
but
none
of
it
lasted
very
long
lightly
carbonated
when
first
poured
there
was
an
aroma
of
apple
spice
a
hint
of
cinammon
that
made
me
think
this
could
be
interesting
carbonated
mouthfeel
dry
with
a
bitter
sharp
taste
some
hops
malt
but
not
in
great
tandem
the
finish
drops
off
quickly
and
i
found
it
a
little
harsh
and
rough
on
the
palate
the
ingredients
listed
on
the
side
of
the
can
include
mollose
syrup
and
hop
extract
at
least
theyre
up
front
about
that
it
looked
and
smelled
better
than
it
was
pours
a
clear
golden
color
about
2
shades
darker
than
a
macro
the
head
was
average
and
not
much
lacing
was
detected
the
smell
is
faint
some
bready
malt
was
picked
up
the
taste
is
of
biscuit
like
malt
with
some
honey
flavor
servicable
grassy
peppery
hops
to
round
out
the
flavor
the
feel
is
light
with
some
tight
carbonation
finishes
a
bit
peppery
on
the
palate
my
first
impression
of
this
beer
was
that
it
wasnt
a
czech
pils
it
is
a
bit
more
malty
and
not
as
dry
as
the
others
definitely
worth
a
try
just
not
what
i
expected
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
white
creamy
head
that
fades
away
pretty
quickly
smells
floral
and
a
little
citrusy
not
bad
tastes
a
little
light
struck
damn
you
green
bottles
and
sweet
with
a
lot
of
hop
bitterness
that
i
cant
place
possibly
saaz
its
a
bit
grassy
and
a
bit
citrusy
its
really
tasty
finishes
a
little
sour
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
some
tingling
from
the
carbonation
but
not
much
not
really
creamy
just
heavy
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
just
wish
it
was
cheaper
or
didnt
come
in
green
bottles
as
i
cant
afford
a
case
of
the
stuff
overall
not
a
top
tier
czech
pils
a
servicable
beer
for
sure
but
there
are
much
better
out
there
i
tried
this
beer
on
august
10
2007
at
the
esplanade
biermarket
in
toronto
the
beer
was
a
deep
translucent
gold
in
colour
with
a
very
white
small
head
that
lasted
mere
seconds
the
aroma
on
the
other
was
quite
foul
with
some
soapy
hints
the
mouthfeel
was
thinbodied
and
very
crisp
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
the
taste
was
slightly
malty
with
a
strong
presence
of
wheat
872007wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
metallic
taste
very
pedestrian
no
aroma
to
speak
ofexcept
maybe
for
a
bit
of
skunk
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
nothing
special
kind
of
watery
i
would
neither
seek
this
out
nor
recommend
i
cant
believe
this
is
rated
as
high
as
it
is
d
top
notch
for
anybody
who
loves
a
beer
that
reminds
them
of
a
good
bread
overall
a
competent
czech
pilsner
but
nothing
remarkable
d
nothing
special
it
is
not
a
very
refreshing
i
had
this
one
on
tap
during
a
recent
trip
to
italy
it
was
served
during
a
a
nice
dinner
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
the
brew
is
unremarkably
ordinary
its
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
slight
white
head
nice
and
soapy
lace
but
not
much
else
the
aroma
is
faint
with
a
hint
of
grain
and
a
touch
of
malt
its
a
very
fleeting
and
light
smell
its
not
a
good
characteristic
to
have
to
search
for
an
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
sweeter
than
an
american
lager
but
its
very
subdued
the
beer
is
light
lightly
carbonated
and
simple
the
finish
is
a
little
watery
its
an
everyday
drinking
beer
a
worthy
lawnmower
beer
but
nothing
more
it
goes
down
well
with
meat
and
potatoes
can
be
filling
over
long
sessions
but
its
a
decent
session
beer
its
better
than
american
macro
brews
but
there
are
better
pilsners
out
there
overall
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
styleway
too
skunky
but
compliments
grilled
chicken
with
vegetable
dishes
quite
nicely
d
not
a
true
genuine
classic
pilsner
to
me
but
a
fantastic
alternative
to
british
lagers
which
many
of
leave
you
feeling
rather
sick
bloated
and
give
horrible
syrupy
sweet
aftertastes
a
nice
beer
i
must
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
traditional
middle
of
the
road
czech
pilsner
if
you
could
get
a
sample
when
looking
up
beer
in
a
dictionary
this
is
probably
how
it
would
taste
this
is
a
fine
pilsener
from
the
very
land
that
gave
us
this
golden
joy
its
a
refreshing
enough
easy
sessionable
fits
much
better
in
the
category
of
epl
rather
than
czech
pilsener
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
for
a
nobrainer
session
lager
with
enough
dryness
grab
another
staropramen
lager
is
the
only
beer
from
this
brewery
that
ive
ever
had
looking
at
the
number
of
reviews
for
the
rest
of
their
lineup
i
might
never
run
across
another
one
thats
okay
theres
nothing
here
to
make
me
the
least
bit
curious
about
what
else
these
guys
have
up
their
sleeves
if
you
give
this
one
a
shot
dont
expect
rabbits
skunks
are
a
distinct
possibility
though
pours
clear
and
light
gold
two
shades
away
from
yellow
with
a
pretty
short
head
for
the
style
aromas
of
seafresh
saaz
hops
and
lightly
breaded
malts
but
its
a
quick
and
shallow
nose
albeit
with
some
pleasing
sharpness
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
with
concentrated
fizzy
carbonation
hop
bitterness
is
right
out
front
and
is
just
about
the
only
flavor
going
on
the
malts
have
zero
presence
here
like
the
nose
its
truncated
with
simple
flavors
and
no
depth
overall
this
is
a
simple
beer
certainly
very
drinkable
with
little
special
character
to
recommend
it
still
i
do
imagine
it
would
be
a
good
substitute
for
coors
light
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
i
mean
that
in
a
positive
way
clear
tawny
copper
bordering
on
a
crystal
clear
golden
hue
thin
dusty
white
head
that
is
quick
to
dissolve
sweet
grains
husky
malts
a
neareuro
skunking
aroma
that
does
not
detract
from
the
quality
crisp
grassy
hops
medium
carbonation
not
much
going
on
here
turns
a
bit
dry
light
bodied
musk
like
malts
and
a
lingering
dry
hops
felt
towards
the
end
simple
too
simple
faint
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
pale
malt
with
fistful
of
spring
flowers
tall
light
bright
white
head
held
for
a
while
leaving
some
random
patches
of
lace
transparent
pale
golden
beer
holds
a
few
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
tastes
like
sweet
dandelions
instead
of
a
hop
bite
in
the
finish
there
is
a
faint
twang
just
a
strange
pils
its
good
for
another
7
months
so
that
shouldnt
be
a
problem
id
like
some
more
grassyspicy
hops
a
bit
of
bite
in
the
finish
and
a
crisp
drinking
beer
medium
bodied
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
great
party
beer
if
you
are
having
more
closedminded
guests
over
however
this
one
drinks
pretty
smoothly
and
theres
few
actual
flaws
in
the
flavour
it
does
end
up
tasting
rather
dull
though
poured
a
deep
golden
color
with
imprerssive
white
puffy
head
virtually
no
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
citruslike
with
some
strong
lemon
notes
taste
is
extremely
crisp
and
almost
austerely
dry
yet
very
thirstquenching
finishes
with
a
strong
dryness
that
beckons
for
another
taste
very
drinkable
nice
example
of
the
style
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
is
a
long
way
from
being
interesting
lager
in
my
opinion
finishes
crisply
with
good
aftertastes
still
a
hint
of
wild
vegetation
in
there
may
appeal
to
some
taste
was
a
little
more
malty
a
slight
bitter
and
a
pretty
full
body
i
think
i
taste
some
vanilla
overall
lack
of
smell
and
taste
i
am
not
too
pleased
with
this
beer
taste
is
grassy
nice
noble
hops
in
the
finish
not
very
complicated
just
the
tiniest
hint
of
skunk
pretty
tasty
just
a
bit
watery
could
be
a
bit
more
crisp
but
overall
a
decent
pilsener
good
fo
the
atlanta
summer
just
a
ppleasant
but
un
exciting
lager
staropramen
lager
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
green
eleven
point
two
ounce
bottle
aroma
is
on
the
skunky
side
which
i
suspect
is
intentional
rather
than
being
light
damage
skunky
hops
and
medicinal
herb
flavors
predominate
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
as
the
case
may
be
makes
you
wonder
how
it
tastes
fresh
from
the
brewery
like
i
said
though
i
think
the
skunk
may
be
an
intentional
part
of
the
beer
profile
but
as
sampled
i
cannot
recommend
trying
this
beer
raspy
mouthfilling
texture
good
representation
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
color
and
that
first
impression
but
the
aroma
and
flavor
was
much
different
than
my
memory
of
the
first
times
i
had
it
on
tap
in
prague
perhaps
it
doesnt
travel
well
or
theyve
tailored
it
to
a
different
market
or
perhaps
it
was
the
fact
that
we
could
buy
a
round
for
the
whole
table
for
about
a
buck
whatever
the
reason
this
was
a
disappointment
had
a
12
oz
bottle
at
a
greek
restaurant
actually
went
pretty
well
with
the
olive
and
spicebased
appetizers
of
course
the
food
probably
hid
some
of
the
aroma
and
taste
of
the
beer
but
all
and
all
not
a
bad
pilsner
will
have
to
try
again
sometime
when
other
factors
arent
present
not
a
problem
ordering
another
one
of
these
recommended
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
the
tonguesearing
extreme
carbonation
that
the
looks
of
it
implied
drinkability
is
fine
as
well
really
a
solid
import
beer
here
a
lot
better
than
other
green
bottle
pilseners
from
overseas
this
is
a
classic
czech
pilsner
with
a
good
taste
and
finish
that
doesnt
leave
your
throat
tasting
like
sawdust
after
multiple
drafts
as
you
occassionally
get
with
the
style
d
better
than
american
lagers
but
nt
much
more
to
say
moderately
drinkable
but
just
flat
out
disappointing
was
hoping
for
more
being
that
im
drinking
this
here
in
its
home
city
overall
very
clean
and
quite
even
throughout
the
experience
a
winner
between
this
beer
and
pilsner
urquell
the
other
czech
lager
available
at
the
local
liquor
store
it
is
pretty
much
sixes
12oz
bottle
pours
out
a
golden
yellow
color
with
minimal
head
no
lacing
it
smelled
of
grain
and
spice
surprisingly
there
was
no
skunky
smell
i
could
taste
some
hop
flavor
and
a
little
spice
it
was
relatively
crisp
and
smooth
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
it
is
a
pretty
descent
european
lager
overall
i
wont
buy
this
again
but
as
a
czech
pilsener
this
is
quite
a
good
one
fans
of
the
style
might
like
it
d
overall
quite
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
one
of
the
better
pilseners
ive
had
picked
this
bitch
up
for
2
99
a
sixer
at
bevmo
on
sale
best
before
date
is
a
couple
months
past
due
i
tend
to
not
shy
away
from
beers
past
their
supposed
prime
and
have
had
nothing
but
success
to
this
point
i
couldnt
pass
up
the
price
and
it
turns
out
the
beer
was
fine
very
drinkable
and
kind
of
weather
but
hot
days
they
would
go
down
fast
yes
it
tastes
a
bit
light
but
i
am
not
reviewing
this
expecting
a
strong
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
out
of
most
east
european
lagers
as
the
beer
is
poured
from
the
bottle
a
good
golden
color
emerges
there
is
a
sizeable
frothy
head
that
holds
quite
well
the
beer
smells
of
bitterness
from
hops
and
perhaps
a
slight
skunk
smell
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
hoppy
bitterness
but
there
are
better
pilsners
out
there
the
beer
has
a
strong
body
with
good
carbonation
this
is
quite
drinkable
but
as
said
before
if
you
want
a
pilsner
there
are
better
pilsners
out
there
dark
gold
in
colour
with
lots
of
carbonation
grassy
hop
aroma
with
a
touch
of
grainy
malt
upon
drinking
more
honey
flavored
malt
flavors
with
a
decent
enough
contribution
of
herbal
and
grassy
hop
notes
medium
bitterness
a
basic
czech
pils
which
is
still
a
pretty
drinkable
thing
in
my
book
d
much
better
than
my
last
experience
of
this
beer
on
tap
in
st
albans
nr
london
where
i
encountered
the
worst
staropramen
id
ever
experienced
perhaps
because
that
one
was
brewed
under
license
and
this
one
authentic
yet
for
my
taste
this
beer
is
not
so
pronounced
as
many
pils
or
pilsners
i
tried
on
tap
during
my
trip
in
the
czech
republic
its
rather
like
a
more
vaguelydefinedgeneric
euro
pale
lager
as
the
characters
are
not
as
focused
as
a
pils
should
be
having
said
that
nothings
wrong
with
it
being
a
easydrinking
lager
light
body
malty
clean
and
refreshing
unless
that
indicates
a
cross
between
redemption
and
temptation
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
so
clear
that
you
could
watch
tv
or
whatever
through
your
glass
of
beer
basically
exactly
how
you
expect
a
pils
to
look
grainy
grassy
aroma
full
and
clean
maltgrain
flavor
i
hate
to
say
it
but
the
grainy
character
is
somewhat
similar
to
pbr
not
that
this
is
cheap
or
cruddy
at
all
because
its
actually
a
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
pilsner
pretty
good
beer
allinall
a
reasonable
brew
and
i
preferred
it
to
budvar
not
a
beer

i
would
drink
regularly
an
average

with
again
the
crisp

a
good
impression
carbonation
is
great
for
the
style
and
no

is
a
bonus
for
those

lacks
the

can
i
have
some
more
bitter
hops
please
the
7th
tasting
in

10
lcbo
lackluster

this
one
is
the

pronouncement
a
nice
bohemian
lager
very
drinkable
i
would
like
to
have
that
beer
in
the
summer
not
in
january
when
its
50
outside
smooth
and
creamy
drinkable
which
is
above
average
for
pils
ive
had
beats
urquel
clean
decent
malts
slight
citrus
in

hops
good
carbonation
in

balanced
but
on
sweetish
side
another
average
lcbo
lager
import
but
fresh
thanks
paul
very
drinkable
after
reading
the
other
reviews
ill
keep
away
from
the
scary
green
bottle
though
another
euro
lager
in
appearance
crystal
clear
gold
color
almost
no
head
just
a
few
wisps
of
bubbles
on
the
top
of
the
beer
smells
of
grassy
malts
more
skunky
than
most
els
but
other
than
that
mostly
the
same
experience
as
any
beer
from
that
style
only
worse
i
will
never
buy
this
again
there
are
too
many
better
beers
out
there
sweet
honey
up
front
turning
to
lightly
toasted
malt
wave
of
floral
sea
air
spicy
hops
crests
adequately
bitter
into
the
finish
refreshing
spritzy
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
a
little
bit
more
of
a
hop
bite
would
do
this
brew
some
good
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvet
like
and
i
would
say
carbonation
is
just
right
crisp
and
refreshing
im
about
to
pour
my
third
one
and
im
still
looking
forward
to
it
rather
nondescript
eurolager
nothing
standout
here
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
overall
a
decent
beer
however
the
hop
bite
is
just
too
much
for
my
liking
overall
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
representitive
of
its
class
pours
a
nice
deeper
golden
with
a
thinner
then
expected
head
even
with
a
rough
pour
very
clean
no
lacing
at
allaroma
was
a
little
skunky
green
bottlewith
a
hint
of
sweet
grain
noticed
a
little
smokiness
in
flavor
off
the
bat
with
a
touch
of
toasted
grain
and
iron
not
much
hop
presence
though
for
a
czech
lagerpilsner
just
light
zip
in
the
finish
taste
is
on
the
drier
side
and
goes
down
well
in
the
summer
herei
would
drink
this
over
any
domestic
or
canadian
macro
when
i
want
a
easy
drinking
lager
but
those
green
bottles
scare
me
more
euro
trash
beer
staropramen
is
a
light
cold
colour
pours
with
a
nice
head
but
the
foam
quickly
recedes
to
film
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
just
a
few
whiffs
sporatically
placed
around
the
glass
makes
the
glass
look
broken
actually
wet
cardboard
smell
reminds
me
when
i
once
helped
a
friend
move
in
the
rain
bit
skunky
as
well
green
bottlelightstruck
or
purpusely
done
you
decide
its
not
an
overwhelming
skunk
so
im
leaning
towards
the
latter
starts
out
bland
like
soggy
cereal
not
much
of
anything
expected
in
a
beer
like
hops
malt
or
even
adjuncts
aftertaste
is
a
bit
skunky
sour
im
not
sure
what
it
is
but
i
hate
the
mouthfeel
its
dry
oily
and
leaves
an
unpleasant
sensation
on
the
side
of
the
tongues
not
something
i
would
drink
again
i
could
state
that
if
offered
for
free
i
might
take
it
but
that
only
means
it
wasnt
truly
horrible
id
take
bud
light
if
offered
for
free
i
might
even
take
colt
45
if
offered
for
free
dont
get
this
beer
a
dark
gold
body
topped
by
a
decent
white
head
the
nose
is
mostly
of
the
saaz
hops
with
the
taste
a
typical
czech
pilsner
there
is
the
nice
floral
side
and
just
a
small
bit
of
snap
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
topnotch
on
a
warm
summer
day
just
a
small
bit
on
the
cloudy
side
for
a
pilsner
not
a
bad
pilsner
a
decent
beer
for
this
style
appearance
is
a
clear
golden
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
the
tell
tale
signature
of
czech
pilsner
the
saaz
is
very
apparent
and
inviting
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
hops
deliver
a
flowery
aftertaste
clean
light
body
and
easy
drinkability
a
good
summer
beer
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
a
solidly
enjoyable
brew
my
green
bottle
looks
slightly
different
than
the
one
pictured
it
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
two
inch
offwhite
head
head
collapses
quickly
into
patchy
lacing
aroma
has
some
euro
skunked
cardboard
which
masks
some
hints
of
lemon
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
fizzy
with
carbonation
taste
is
mostly
hop
bitterness
just
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
very
one
dimensional
with
this
lack
of
malt
balance
finishes
bitter
and
astringency
detracts
greatly
from
drinkability
this
poured
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
a
nice
one
inch
head
light
lacing
developed
through
the
drink
the
aroma
is
average
as
some
malt
and
hops
are
detectable
the
flavor
was
typical
czech
pilsner
malt
with
a
biting
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
lemon
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
crisp
and
the
bitterness
lasted
on
the
tongue
for
a
minute
after
swallowing
nice
carbonation
levels
a
refreshing
beer
nevertheless
it
was
a
perfectly
acceptable
lager
and
had
the
virtue
of
being
very
crisp
and
a
little
lemony
which
in
this
case
was
a
good
thing
sinkability

this
one
didnt
cut
the
mustard
this
is
trying
really
hard
to
be
average
as
you
drink
it
it
doesnt
even
try
to
flatter
itself
tastes
too
unbalanced
for
me
dont
think
ill
have
another
pours
crystal
clear
and
golden
hued
with
tiny
bubbles
and
minimal
head
and
lace
aroma
is
mild
malt
stomach
acids
and
light
citrus
saaz
hop
aroma
flavors
are
pale
malt
mild
bitterings
and
a
very
light
sweet
nees
to
the
aftertaste
relatively
complex
lager
and
very
classic
to
style
in
my
opinion
ed
note
ive
had
this
beer
in
prague
on
the
square
and
it
so
much
better
its
not
even
comparable
to
the
stuff
out
of
the
bottle
every
who
likes
beer
should
drink
the
czech
beers
locally
they
just
do
them
justice
by
sticking
them
in
green
bottles
and
shipping
them
to
the
us
had
this
at
a
hole
in
the
wall
in
a
fancy
part
of
downtown
moscow
it
was
clearly
fresher
than
the
last
time
i
tried
it
previous
review
came
out
a
deep
solid
gold
under
a
substantial
white
head
that
showed
some
staying
power
and
generated
excellent
lace
the
nose
was
mild
with
flowery
hops
the
mouth
was
prickly
and
light
the
hops
kick
in
from
the
start
not
overwhelming
but
ensuring
a
mildly
bitter
experience
throughout
malts
are
there
to
provide
balance
up
front
but
the
overall
experience
is
hoppiness
particularly
as
the
malt
fades
in
the
finish
leaving
the
aftertaste
completely
to
the
hoppy
forces
good
stuff
the
dry
bitterness
only
makes
you
want
more
and
more
and
more
had
my
first
sample
today
this
is
definitely
going
to
be
one
of
my
favourite
pilseners
in
the
future
whenever
i
can
afford
it
or
get
it
abroad
i
guess
the
czechs
wont
call
it
a
pilsener
as
its
not
being
brewed
in
plzen
but
to
me
its
a
pils
good
enough
good
lasting
head
delicious
saaz
aroma
pleasant
flavour
very
well
balanced
better
aftertaste
than
most
pilseners
i
was
a
bit
surprised
by
the
nice
light
gold
glow
of
this
one
but
maybe
just
because
my
last
two
lagers
were
miller
lite
and
coors
light
the
head
is
nice
and
white
and
slightly
soupy
but
no
bigger
than
middling
the
aroma
is
mildly
hoppy
maybe
a
little
skunked
the
flavor
is
more
malt
than
hops
it
has
that
bonedry
straw
malt
flavor
that
a
pilsner
is
supposed
to
have
but
theres
something
slightly
unpleasant
going
on
fairly
drinkable
but
theres
something
i
dont
like
about
it
it
does
have
that
nice
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
that
bitburger
and
a
few
other
quality
pils
have
better
than
a
plain
jane
macro
but
not
real
special
this
beer
is
czech
in
nature
it
has
that
slightly
creamy
feel
to
it
and
just
an
edge
of
hops
but
nothing
dramatic
if
it
was
ever
produced
as
a
highquality
beer
it
isnt
now
ok
its
a
genuine
pilsner
and
its
not
made
from
rice
but
the
rest
of
the
large
box
of
it
i
bought
last
week
is
now
taunting
me
from
my
garage
i
m
afraid
ill
have
to
use
it
up
my
lesschoosy
beerdrinking
visitors
pours
a
light
goldenyellow
colour
like
many
many
other
beers
has
a
thin
snow
white
head
that
is
rather
quick
to
dissipate
the
smell
is
actually
as
strange
as
it
may
sound
quite
close
to
fresh
cut
green
apples
the
taste
too
reminds
me
faintly
of
apples
leaves
a
very
light
lacing
on
ones
glass
with
each
drink
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
lightweight
with
light
to
moderate
carbonation
leaning
more
towards
light
this
is
a
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
beer
i
will
most
certainly
spend
money
on
this
czech
again
medium

some

really
why
bother
drinking
this

average
beer
at
best
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
small
to
large
white
bubbles
that
mostly
diminished
and
left
a
fair
lacing
the
body
was
a
transparent
light
golden
color
it
had
a
mild
hop
aroma
it
was
initially
bitter
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
the
inital
bite
smoothened
in
in
the
finish
and
left
a
slightly
tingly
lingering
mouthfeel
appearance
of
an
average
lager
in
color
and
head
skunky
aroma
which
i
kind
of
like
in
my
pilsners
i
dont
know
why
but
i
do
taste
did
not
have
as
much
skunkiness
but
still
had
a
little
very
light
in
body
not
much
malt
here
mostly
hops
slightly
bitter
but
no
overpowering
flavor
finishes
crisp
and
clean
good
for
a
cheap
import
thx
this
beer
pours
a
normal
yellow
color
with
medium
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
malty
and
almost
a
little
sour
the
flavor
is
dry
with
very
apparent
hops
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
sourness
is
detectable
in
the
sides
of
the
mouth
but
not
too
much
very
reminiscent
of
a
better
heineken
the
finish
is
moderately
dry
id
have
this
again
probably
since
it
is
not
very
expensive
but
it
wasnt
anything
wonderful
drinkablility
i
would
only
drink
this
beer
again
if
there
was
nothing
else
available
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
flavor
is
largely
honey
and
grain
with
a
bit
of
skunk
oil
rolling
on
the
tongue
the
malt
quickly
drops
to
a
dry
crisp
hoppy
finish
i
agree
with
the
pilsner
urquell
comparison
with
this
one
this
one
competes
with
the
world
class
pils
staropramen
is
a
clear
golden
beer
with
a
very
small
and
fast
disappearing
head
the
aroma
is
very
inviting
with
sweet
and
hoppy
tones
and
the
flavor
is
just
like
a
czech
pilsener
should
be
very
easily
drinkable
with
a
faint
sweetness
to
start
with
but
then
dominated
by
the
very
nice
hoppy
bitterness
5
abv
the
taste
begins
with
a
malty
sweet
assault
and
lingers
however
it
finishes
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
nice
hop
finish
i
have
a
feeling
a
fresh
one
of
these
on
tap
would
kick
ass
deep
reddishgolden
color
quite
clear
with
lots
of
fine
bubbles
and
a
small
offwhite
head
rich
aroma
of
sweet
and
bready
malts
with
noble
hops
and
miraculously
no
skunk
aroma
taste
begins
with
rather
sweet
malts
and
slight
carbonation
midway
through
the
taste
spicy
hops
ride
atop
the
malts
by
the
end
of
the
taste
the
hops
leave
a
harsh
and
metallic
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
pleasant
overall
a
good
lager
that
might
benefit
from
some
tweaking
of
its
hop
profile
the
aftertaste
is
excessively
bitter
compared
to
others
i
must
have
not
bought
a
old
or
skunked
bottle
mine
was
actually
quite
fresh
tasting
wonderful
fresh
and
clear
saaztype
hop
aroma
that
faded
some
with
time
bright
clear
and
dark
gold
with
full
head
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
nicely
balanced
beer
with
a
little
less
bitterness
that
other
czech
beers
of
similar
ilk
but
enough
to
make
presence
known
hop
bite
lasts
throughout
with
medium
long
finish
good
malt
backing
providing
nice
body
and
some
richness
light
to
medium
body
flatter
feel
but
adequate
carbonation
good
all
around
and
balanced
beer
taste
light
crisp
mouthfeel
bitter
as
sin
from
plenty
of
hops
that
hang
right
in
there
on
the
long
aftertaste
quaffable
ill
admit
that
id
buy
pilsner
urquell
and
czechvar
first
but
this
is
pretty
good
beer
and
running
third
place
to
those
two
is
nothin
to
be
ashamed
of
the
beer
is
extremely
smooth
with
an
almost
unnoticeable
carbonation
the
malts
dominate
the
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
not
say
it
is
a
remarkable
beer
but
it
is
certainly
better
than
average

midmouth
carbonation
is
medium
perhaps
this
beers
best
quality
ok
in
drinkability
but
nothing
special
is
going
on
in
this
brew
some
similarities
to
heineken

al
crystal
clear
dark
straw
hue
topped
by
a
fluffy
porcelin
white
head
skunky
mercaptans
sulfur
and
rough
grain
huskiness
in
aroma
the
sharp
astringent
graininess
coupled
w
the
rough
bitterness
make
this
quite
rough
for
a
pilsner
sulfur
persists
in
the
flavor
and
is
a
bit
offputting
all
around
this
beer
almost
abrasive
on
the
palette
the
body
is
weak
and
watery
while
the
malt
backbone
is
seriously
lacking
finishes
w
an
unpleasant
tannic
astringent
note
i
most
likely
got
a
poorly
handled
bottle
but
i
just
dont
see
myself
ever
having
this
again
i
really
like
it
soft
maltiness
with
a
icely
bitter
finish
very
elegant
subtle
and
just
plain
good
very
good
for
session
drinking
aswell
hazy

color
with
a

saaz
hop
aroma
quickly
asserts
itself
but
doesnt
overwhelm
sort
of
a
cross
between
heineken
and
pilsener
urquell
nothing
really
great
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
and
little
carbonation
seems
dead
maybe
i
got
an
old
bottle

a
slight
clinging

mildly

lowkey

aroma
starts
thin
to

ending

meager
malt
profile
causing
balance
to
tip
too
far
to
the
hop
end
its
drinkable
but
not
worth
a
search
seems
to
be
similar
to
a
pilsner
urquell
also
in
a
green
bottle
this
is
from
a
large
brewer
and
is
better
than
the
majors
over
here
the
abv
is

the
initial
aroma
from
the
12
oz
bottle
was
extremely
skunky
after
pouring
the
skunk
dissipated
a
bit
i
could
then
detect
some
of
the
beers
true
characteristics
perfect
light
effervescent
mouthfeel
nice
semisweet
malt
and
herbly
spiced
hop
finish
unfortunately
some
skunk
essence
still
remained
ill
have
to
seek
this
one
out
on
tap
the
largest
brewer
in
the
czech
republic
why
cant
ab
or
miller
make
beer
this
good
only
average
for
czech
rep
but
much
better
than
the
swill
were
used
to
here
im
not
sure
where
exactly
the
old
spring
that
gives
the
beer
its
name
is
very
clean
and
crisp
with
moderate
hops
not
bad
from
the
bottle
but
on
tap
is
vastly
superior
in
the
tap
version
i
sometimes
get
just
the
barest
hint
of
spearmint
in
the
finish
of
course
the
pink
elephants
show
up
a
little
while
after
that
cheap
and
drinkable
but
a
little
boring
i
suppose
the
style
rarely
excites
me
overall
not
a
bad
pilsner
but
not
my
favourite
an
easydrinking
beer
but
nothing
really
special
decent
price
for
au62
for
a
case
of
20
x
500ml
final
thoughts
at
first
looking
at
the
can
i
thought
this
was
a
doppelbock
probably
becuase
of
the
goat
logo
and
the
long
name
in
the
background
i
guess
thats
not
really
relevant
but
i
think
they
should
try
to
work
on
making
their
beer
a
bit
more
like
one
ie
killing
the
dryness
and
giving
more
of
a
malt
presence
o
traditional
mass
produced
euro
export
pilsener
nothing
mind
blowing
easy
drinking
and
reasonably
flavourful
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
its
worth
a
try
and
certainly
a
reasonable
option
in
a
pinch
taste
is
good
not
spectacular
but
the
good
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
good
beer
on
a
warm
day
next
id
tried
this
before
and
its
now
like
night
and
day
when
compared
to
this
one
a
lot
sweeter
and
easier
to
drink
without
the
skunk
flavours
this
one
was
a
very
nice
lager
that
i
would
have
again
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
faint
lager
like
notes
but
almost
nothing
in
the
taste
dry
lager
tones
but
almost
skunky
which
is
weird
cause
its
in
a
can
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dryness
to
a
clean
aftertaste
domestic
lager
like
faint
tastes
and
smells
eh
o
i
hope
the
style
gets
better
than
kozel
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
o
typical
czech
pilsener
light
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
an
average
czech
pilsner
that
carries
its
most
basic
characteristics
and
doesnt
strive
to
improve
on
them
with
the
abundance
of
pilsners
readily
available
to
me
this
seems
easy
to
pass
up
chances
are
if
youve
ever
had
a
beer
then
youve
tried
a
czech
inspired
pilsner
their
clean
complexion
quenching
light
body
and
zesty
hop
profile
converted
an
entire
planet
of
beer
drinkers
onto
lagers
its
too
bad
that
so
many
macro
breweries
apparently
czech
ones
included
have
bastardized
the
style
and
exposed
so
many
to
such
poor
renditions
i
loved
in
czech
for
6
months
and
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
most
of
americans
didnt
like
it
as
much
and
opted
for
the
less
pungent
gambrinus
great
example
of
a
fine
pilsner
i
tried
back
in
the
us
and
i
would
have
to
say
its
not
the
same
but
still
a
great
beer
drinkability
is
just
ok
the
strange
looking
goat
rooster
creature
on
the
label
seems
quite
proud
of
it
but
im
not
sure
you
will
be
d
not
enough
hops
too
bland
but
i
think
im
right
in
saying
the
creamy
texture
in
the
finish
is
supposed
to
be
there
so
that
makes
up
slightly
for
it
nevertheless
better
pilseners
out
there
next
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
and
accurate
example
of
of
simple
style
d
not
the
most
interesting
beer
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
pretty
good
value
too
at
2
99aus
for
a
500ml
bottle
i
tried
this
beer
after
purchasing
at
my
local
lcbo
store
it
poured
a
somwehat
cloudy
gold
colour
not
translucent
the
aroma
was
strong
and
malty
with
some
grainy
tones
it
is
slightly
thick
on
the
tongue
with
very
little
carbonation
the
taste
is
slightly
malty
with
a
toasty
aftertaste
this
is
another
czech
beer
i
would
have
no
problem
trying
again
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
beer
medium
bitterness
and
body
finishes
crisply
and
not
cloying
quite
refreshing
but
nothing
remarkable
a
good
example
of
an
underrated
style
there
might
me
a
lot
of
more
complex
ones
but
a
czech
pilsener
should
be
straightforward
not
much
of
a
pilsner
sweet
with
a
lot
of
foam
ok
mouthfeel
but
on
the
light
side
a
bit
of
bitter
grassy
hops
drinkable
because
its
not
offensive
but
only
got
me
through
as
nothing
else
worth
drinking
nothing
in
aroma
past
the
malt
for
me
a
macro
version
of
a
czech
beer
pleasnat
and
drinkable
especially
as
the
days
become
longer
and
warmer
can
poured
a
yellowish
color
pilsner
with
a
big
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
what
seems
like
corn
and
adjunct
is
quite
surprising
since
i
didnt
though
czech
brewery
were
using
those
ingredient
taste
is
also
bland
with
very
little
malt
and
no
hops
at
all
overall
i
was
quite
disappointed
with
this
one
and
was
expecting
closer
to
pilsner
urquell
then
this
smooth
beer
tasty
and
refreshing
not
an
outstanding
pilsner
but
definatly
respectable
taste
is
crisp
hoppy
with
good
floral
hops
that
comes
to
play
with
a
great
ceralic

ill
probably
be
picking
this
one
up
again
when
the

hits
md

nice
overall

dry
could
use
some
more
hops
for
the

however
you
cant
go
wrong
d
nothing
harsh
but
nothing
exciting
either
medium
gold
in
colour
with
lots
of
carbonation
good
aromas
of
honeylike
malt
and
both
grassy
and
floral
hops
that
floral
note
is
especially
nice
the
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
the
aroma
with
more
corse
grassy
notes
entering
the
lightly
malted
mix
but
the
bitterness
is
at
a
good
level
for
this
style
of
beer
overall
a
fairly
good
pilsner
the
drinkability
is
better
than
the
taste
smooth
and
crisp
a
beer
that
can
be
downed
in
a
session
with
ease
the
lack
of
flavour
present
in
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
disappointing
strong
malt
presence
in
the
taste
as
well
nice
but
could
use
some
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
very
smooth
i
gotta
say
i
like
this
pilsener
it
pours
a
deep
orangey
gold
with
a
small
ivory
head
that
leaves
swathes
of
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
a
balance
of
biscuit
malts
and
czech
noble
hops
the
taste
begins
with
a
hoppy
punch
and
some
great
malt
flavors
that
build
in
the
middle
to
take
precedence
and
then
recede
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
grassy
very
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
lightly
carbonated
for
a
lager
a
great
beer
by
any
respect
the
czechs
definitely
know
their
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
pilsner
to
drink
give
kozel
premium
a
try
good
session
beer
i
really
like
the
hint
of
sweetness
up
front
i
think
if
youre
going
to
go
for
a
europils
might
as
well
make
it
kozel
it
ranks
right
up
there
with
urquell
and
czechvar
for
sure
very
drinkable
very
pale
and
clear
but
with
a
deep
hint
of
redgold
malty
certainly
but
a
very
honeyish
malt
flavour
as
opposed
to
the
fuller
budvar
maltiness
that
comes
from
the
very
pale
malts
has
that
characteristic
czech
trick
of
vanishing
down
your
throat
before
you
even
realize
it
leaves
behind
a
slowly
creeping
rich
floral
bitterness
appearance
golden
orange
hue
with
a
white
bubbly
head
nicely
formed
leaves
evenly
spread
rings
of
lacing
aroma
nice
grassy
peppery
saaz
hops
are
detectable
but
mild
and
soothing
semisweet
malts
are
there
to
balance
great
blend
here
reserved
but
fresh
smelling
brew
taste
middle
of
the
road
on
my
spectrum
but
still
a
tasty
czech
beer
that
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
lemongrass
tone
to
it
with
a
decent
hop
bite
of
bitterness
nothing
spectacular
but
fends
well
against
other
euro
lagers
mouthfeel
thin
to
light
in
body
does
lack
a
bit
of
carbonation
for
the
style
but
a
smooth
cohesive
tone
drinkability
pretty
nice
overall
not
a
gold
winner
but
all
and
all
refreshing
aaahhh
the
pour
a
translucent
gold
color
with
the
head
portly
in
size
and
the
texture
semicreamy
bright
white
in
color
as
it
dissipates
a
fine
sheet
of
lace
left
to
seal
off
the
glass
the
malt
nose
somewhat
sweet
and
a
citrus
like
crispness
start
nicely
malted
and
sweet
with
the
top
fair
to
middling
in
its
feel
finish
has
a
light
acidity
with
the
hops
moderate
in
their
spiciness
drinkable
but
just
another
average
lager
pours
a
clear
standard
gold
under
a
two
fingered
head
that
fades
fast
theres
lots
of
barley
in
the
nose
really
a
lot
the
mouth
is
light
and
prickly
lots
of
malt
in
the
opening
taste
and
a
nice
flowery
hop
finish
perfectly
drinkable
there
is
nothing
spectacular
about
this
beer
at
all
as
i
write
this
its
a
stinking
hot
day
out
there
and
this
beer
is
going
down
a
treat
nothing
too
complex
the
characters
of
the
beer
are
all
in
the
right
places
it
makes
for
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
that
doesnt
demand
too
much
of
the
drinker
one
that
can
enter
the
rotation
every
so
often
and
make
a
nice
addition
easy
drinking
beer
with
clean
flavours
and
is
a
steal
at
only
a
couple
of
bucks
for
a
500
ml
bottle
head
disappeared
almost
immediately
after
pouring
clear
pale
gold
colour
with
a
steady
rapid
stream
of
bubbles
making
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
beer
smells
of
straw
honey
and
mild
hops
a
little
to
fizzy
to
my
mouth
it
tastes
of
honey
mild
hops
tasty
id
have
another
i
hate
neck
foils
this
bottle
has
a
neck
foil
dammit
why
anyways
this
was
a
mediocre
pilzner
bought
at
the
lcbo
not
really
knowing
what
the
style
wasdidnt
say
on
the
bottle
poured
typical
pilzner
style
that
pale
yellow
gold
knew
right
away
it
was
a
pilzner
pathetic
head
that
disipated
too
film
bittersweet
smell
with
little
hops
some
honey
and
barley
malt
hey
this
tastes
alright
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
from
the
look
and
smell
well
balanced
sweet
and
bitterness
with
a
honey
aftertaste
not
perfectly
balanced
but
a
fine
attempt
was
made
slick
mouthfeel
and
left
my
throat
a
little
dry
very
drinkable
im
glad
it
comes
in
500ml
bottles
because
341ml
would
be
a
tease
for
more
this
beer
is
very
tasty
especially
for
a
lagerpils
doesnt
have
the
pungency
of
the
pilsener
urquell
and
tends
to
be
a
bit
more
malty
than
pu
aswell
nice
bitterness
not
too
bitter
lovely
smooth
drinkability
and
at
3
1
50
us
per
500ml
bottle
its
pretty
good
value
aswell
great
drop
for
a
quiet
one
at
home
or
for
a
big
night
make
sure
its
fresh
though
a
very
nice
pale
lager
impressive
as
to
all
aspects
of
this
offering
with
one
exception
colour
is
medium
gold
very
nice
head
and
aroma
is
crisp
clean
body
is
medium
and
taste
is
hoppy
and
pleasant
i
love
it
well
i
like
it
a
lot
but
please
get
rid
of
that
neck
foil
smooth
enough
not
a
lot
of
aromatic
hops
in
my
example
bold
style
a
truly
good
authentic
pilsner
bordering
on
great
this
is
the
type
of
pilsner
becks
or
labatts
and
most
north
american
brewers
wished
they
could
produce
they
cant
this
brew
took
time
brew
time
and
cellar
time
the
quality
of
ingredients
and
process
are
there
for
the
palate
to
enjoy
on
this
pilsner
soft
barley
and
malt
tastes
balanced
with
those
heavenly
saaz
bitters
a
great
example
of
czech
pilsen
style
lagers
this
one
has
a
distinguishing
quality
though
it
has
everything
required
of
a
good
pilsner
flowery
hopping
evident
to
the
nose
and
palate
sharp
crisp
start
tartmaltygrassy
in
the
mouth
dry
finish
except
this
one
has
no
lingering
tinny
taste
to
the
tongue
from
the
saaz
hops
probably
not
pasteurized
i
liked
this
pilsner
very
much
and
that
takes
something
for
this
fanatical
pils
head
the
only
draw
back
is
the
price
2
85
per
500mil
bottle
i
was
surprised
this
beer
was
so
fresh
tasting
date
code
was
near
expired
and
it
sat
unrefrigerated
on
the
lcbo
our
state
liquor
monopoly
shelf
a
must
try
if
you
like
pilsners
500ml
bottle
an
excellent
brew
it
has
a
beautiful
full
golden
colour
pours
with
a
light
2
to
3
finger
head
which
dissipates
fairly
quickly
to
a
thin
covering
layer
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
at
first
with
some
nice
very
subtle
bitter
notes
the
kicker
and
what
makes
this
beer
is
the
sweet
honey
aftertaste
it
lingers
long
and
well
to
a
very
nice
effect
very
smooth
with
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
this
is
definitely
drinkable
o
a
flavourful
easygoing
pilsner
love
it
pilsner
is
my
favourite
kind
of
beer
but
i
also
like
heavier
north
american
lagers
like
creemore
this
is
a
pilsner
from
that
perspective
and
its
good
it
has
a
good
pilsner
bite
but
full
of
flavour
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
beers
anywhere
poured
from
can
cereal
and
hay
aroma
clear
and
golden
with
white
head
very
light
bitter
taste
light
body
thin
texture
lively
carbonation
with
an
abrupt
finish
pretty
average
overall
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
good
sized
bubbly
white
head
that
lasts
forever
sweet
grainy
bready
pilsner
and
faint
spicy
floral
hops
flavor
follows
the
aroma
quite
well
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
a
bit
sweet
but
easy
enough
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
mouthfeel
clean
and
crisp
and
exceptionally
dry
finish
lots
of
carbonation
and
light
body
overall
a
well
crafted
czech
pilsner
that
is
worth
repeating
and
stacks
up
well
against
some
of
the
german
and
czech
representations
of
the
style
onot
a
bad
brew
would
have
expected
a
bit
more
hops
but
still
very
clean
and
crisp
i
like
this
its
got
more
charecter
than
alot
of
pilsners
that
attempt
to
match
the
style
it
has
one
factor
that
i
really
like
the
fact
that
it
isnt
over
foamy
some
pilsner
goes
a
bit
overboard
on
the
head
but
this
is
subtle
its
like
a
softer
version
of
stiegl
but
retaining
all
of
its
best
charectaristics
if
available
id
say
dont
pass
this
one
up
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
and
based
on
my
other
reviews
its
probably
obvious
im
a
pilsner
jock
and
this
makes
the
grade
there
are
others
who
i
prefer
over
it
but
its
definatly
great
try
one
today
matches
great
with
spicey
foods
thinking
how
much
i
liked
the
lager
and
the
keller
bier
i
expected
a
little
more
out
of
the
pils
mostly
more
hops
and
a
bigger
flavour
profile
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
make
me
put
my
can
of
konig
or
bitburger
down
still
nice
to
find
in
a
great
new
mixed
pack
light
body
great
carbonation
very
refreshing
o
im
glad
that
creemore
still
brew
beer
their
own
way
even
after
they
were
bought
out
by
molson
coors
creemores
pilsner
is
a
very
close
match
to
the
authentic
czech
pilsners
and
is
leagues
ahead
of
the
macro
lagers
of
the
parent
company
without
doubt
this
is
one
of
the
best
canadian
pilsners
ive
ever
had
overall
a
very
refreshing
pils
that
has
a
bit
of
snap
pale
blonde
colour
ring
of
white
head
no
lace
to
speak
of
really
smell
is
malty
biscuit
like
with
some
of
that
creemore
yeastiness
fairly
earthy
notes
that
give
way
into
some
grassy
and
floral
hops
quite
clean
overall
taste
is
malty
with
a
light
graham
cracker
sweetness
earthy
and
dry
hops
floral
with
a
light
but
assertive
bitterness
with
a
yeastiness
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
medium
prickly
carbonation
smooth
creamy
feel
medium
body
and
like
most
creemore
beers
has
a
good
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
not
the
best
for
the
style
could
have
another
of
these
down
the
road
creemore
springs
pilsner
pours
out
of
the
can
a
dull
golden
color
with
some
yellow
shade
towards
the
side
a
inch
of
loose
ecru
colored
foam
came
and
went
leaving
nothing
smell
is
pale
pilsner
malts
alot
of
them
sweet
smelling
after
some
whiffs
any
hops
have
faded
by
now
semi
scent
of
extract
taste
is
extract
corn
pale
malt
and
sweet
earthy
hop
taste
that
is
old
feel
is
a
bit
lackluster
i
was
expecting
more
carb
from
the
can
light
bodied
yet
not
crisp
enough
to
go
down
easily
i
had
one
and
now
i
am
done
overall
a
nice
refreshing
pilsner
from
creemore
springs
the
mildness
of
the
hops
contributes
to
its
easy
drinkability
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
pretty
white
head
that
fades
to
a
think
film
some
remnants
of
head
nose
is
grassy
and
mildly
floral
some
grainy
bread
general
sweetness
and
vague
characteristics
that
remind
me
of
their
kellerbier
taste
is
sweet
and
grainy
some
corn
bread
with
some
light
hopping
somewhat
sweet
finish
light
bitterness
that
remains
for
a
short
while
carbonation
is
a
tad
low
with
a
bit
of
crispiness
that
i
think
could
have
been
more
pronounced
with
a
better
carbonation
level
medium
body
however
certainly
not
difficult
to
finish
by
any
stretch
but
not
something
id
actively
seek
out
decent
nonetheless
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavours
and
aromas
great
for
a
warm
sunny
day
really
fresh
tasting
a
good
summer
refresher
o
has
some
of
the
crisp
qualities
of
a
classic
pilsner
along
with
some
unique
fruity
and
musty
qualities
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
unique
and
drinkable
enough
to
warrant
a
purchase
ive
always
been
an
occasional
pilsener
guy
this
not
being
one
of
my
favourite
styles
but
i
still
appreciate
a
solid
pils
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
in
recent
memory
cleantasting
crisp
with
all
of
the
flavour
notes
youd
expect
from
a
czechstyle
pils
not
my
favourite
creemore
offering
but
a
worthy
pick
regardless
and
likely
a
new
brew
to
throw
into
the
rotation
if
im
in
a
pils
mood
very
clean
and
crisp
tasting
dry
finish

quencherpair

i
used
to
really

beer
now
not
so
much
its
a

the

from

this

there
just
doesnt

to
be

of
crispness
and
flavor
to
put
it
over
the
top
d
its
decent
there
are
a
lot
of
better
pilsners
out
there
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
very
small
layer
leaving
spots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
mild
grassy
hops
with
some
bready
malt
flavour
isnt
very
big
but
it
is
clean
carbonation
is
good
a
nice
enough
pilsner
but
there
are
better
options
in
ontario
ie
king
and
mill
street
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
though
it
just
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
drink
an
above
average
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
or
any
other
creemore
beer
again
and
again
very
refreshing
beer
and
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
nicely
carbonated
and
very
creamy
i
like
this
better
than
their
lager
but
they
are
both
great
beers
d
quite
drinkable
fairly
economic
too
itd
be
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
but
i
would
choose
something
different
if
looking
to
impress
somebody
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
to
lacing
light
grain
aroma
with
a
trace
of
lemon
crisp
clean
taste
with
a
mild
trace
of
lemon
and
a
good
bitter
finish
fairlt
light
body
that
is
creamy
and
smooth
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
good
for
kicking
back
after
a
long
day
crystal
clear
pale
gold
colour
a
soapy
white
head
fell
quickly
and
didnt
leave
much
behind
on
the
glass

linger
for
a
while
but
disappeared

grassy

spicy

sturdy

offdry
a
little
too
soft
in
texture
and
lacking
crispness
decent
overall
but
not
exciting
enough
to
search
for
again
the
creemore
kellerbier
was
much
more
impressive
an
okay
pils
falling
someplace
between
a
german
and
bohemian
pils
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
is
more
crisp
straight
out
of
the
can
although
the
appearance
is
nice
enough
to
pour
into
a
glass
every
time
just
for
that
i
like
it
but
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
pours
a
pale
golden
that
is
reminiscent
of
ripe
ready
to
be
combined
wheat
head
though
is
minimal
descends
quickly
and
quite
unimpressive
with
no
lacing
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
a
lightly
bready
malt
with
some
hop
aroma
enjoyable
though
a
little
light
for
my
liking
the
body
of
the
beer
comes
across
well
though
balanced
with
light
hop
spiciness
and
a
good
crisp
malt
an
enjoyable
quaff
on
a
hot
day
later
in
the
session
a
slight
vegetal
flavour
lingers
on
the
palate
which
is
offputting
interesting
though
not
a
beer
i
would
precipitate
towards
again
this
is
a
well
rounded
beer
and
i
have
no
complaints
worth
mentioning
drink
it
if
you
get
the
chance
d
a
tasty
pilsener
but
nothing
overly
memorable
easily
drinkable
and
nonoffensive
but
dont
look
to
this
one
for
any
unique
or
standout
flavours
i
purchased
this
in
an
8pack
of
473
ml
cans
and
id
definitely
do
it
again
not
a
beer
to
show
off
to
friends
or
treat
yourself
with
but
definitely
nice
to
share
and
to
have
in
your
fridge
and
its
perfect
for
the
summer
creemore
springs
pilsner
pours
a
light
copper
gold
with
a
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
grainy
a
bit
of
dms
some
sweet
pilsner
malt
pokes
through
along
with
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
the
flavor
is
more
grainy
pale
malt
slightly
tannic
with
some
cooked
corn
there
is
an
assertive
bitterness
and
some
herbal
lemony
hop
flavor
that
leads
into
a
dry
finish
i
was
expect
this
to
be
about
as
much
of
pilsner
as
miller
lite
so
i
was
happily
surprised
not
bad
certainly
quite
drinkable
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
creemore
brews
definitely
needs
to
be
more
assertive
still
ill
happily
drink
this
one
over
other
local
lagers
but
theres
more
robust
examples
of
the
czech
style
to
be
had
d
goes
down
pretty
quick
not
my
favourite
pilsner
but
its
still
pretty
good
overall
an
average
pilsner
but
the
poorest
of
creemores
offerings
in
my
opinion
if
i
could
describe
this
beer
in
one
word
it
would
be
lacking
lacking
in
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
one
might
be
a
bit
more
enjoyable
than
some
of
the
other
euro
imports
of
the
same
style
at
the
lcbo
but
you
dont
have
to
look
far
for
a
better
offering
i
think
its
my
favorite
beer
of
creemore
thus
far
nice
work
a
drinkable
enough
canadianmade
pilsener
sure
but
our
expectations
are
so
abysmally
low
thank
you
pil
that
we
get
all
giddy
about
stuff
like
this
when
it
is
hardly
all
that
adherent
to
the
real
bohemian
style
sigh
oh
well
one
period
in
and
the
score
is
10
canada
woot
on
that
account
at
least
id
drink
it
again
it
was
a
nice
warm
sunny
september
day
with
cicadas
buzzing
and
all
that
so
it
worked
i
wont
go
looking
for
it
though
you
wont
find
the
worlds
best
pilsner
in
creemore
ontario
that
is
a
matter
of
fact
whether
youll
find
a
dreadfully
mediocre
frankly
underachieving
pilsner
or
a
commendable
higherthanaverage
one
is
a
matter
of
opinion
my
personal
opinion
would
side
with
the
former
although
i
dont
wish
to
give
the
impression
this
is
a
bad
beer
not
by
any
means
as
unexceptional
this
is
as
a
pilsner
its
by
no
means
inferior
for
a
conventional
lager
this
newest
addition
to
the
creemore
lineup
is
by
far
the
best
the
pour
releases
an
almost
copper
body
with
a
head
that
is
frothy
and
long
lived
good
lace
here
as
well
the
aroma
is
chalk
full
of
floral
sazz
and
dripping
with
fresh
hay
and
grass
with
some
good
grainy
rye
notes
czech
sipcy
hops
fill
the
mouth
with
flavour
floral
flavours
follow
fresh
cut
grass
greens
hay
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
very
crisp
fizzy
finish
lots
of
fresh
hops
good
bitterness
in
the
finish
id
say
this
is
a
fine
classic
example
some
of
these
ratings
seem
to
be
bashing
the
pilsner
style
instead
of
embracing
a
very
well
made
one
with
a
billion
i
counted
pilseners
available
to
me
at
the
lcbo
im
afraid
this
one
is
far
down
the
list
for
me
as
for
what
tradition
this
traditional
pilsner
is
i
can
not
say
cheers
between
light
and
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
levels
approaching
moderate
i
wouldnt
say
no
if
offered
but
theres
better
pils
to
be
had
in
ontario
final
thoughts
well
its
certainly
better
then
their
urbock
but
still
not
as
good
as
their
lager
a
decent
beer
to
have
with
your
buddies
during
poker
night
or
if
you
were
by
the
pool
and
didnt
want
to
get
smashed
a
good
beer
worth
a
shot
but
stick
to
buying
individual
cans
not
a
whole
pack
i
prefer
the
creemore
lager
to
this
the
hop
presence
is
there
but
the
heavy
malt
character
takes
something
away
poured
a
medium
goldenyellow
color
with
a
larger
sized
white
head
aromas
of
graininess
wet
grass
and
i
was
getting
some
spiciness
tastes
of
the
same
graininess
and
had
a
lighter
sweetish
finish
overall
a
solid
natural
and
unfiltered
pilsner
i
honestly
expected
it
to
be
a
dud
as
i
was
unimpressed
with
the
brewerys
bock
but
this
is
some
fine
stuff
well
done
creemore
bottle

light
golden
frothy

nice

actually
and
perfect
on
the
deck
quaffing
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
12
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
the
local
lcbo
outlets
the
poured
a
translucent
gold
colour
with
a
generous
head
that
quickly
disippates
the
aroma
was
very
malty
with
some
slight
hoppish
hints
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
very
grainy
with
very
little
bitterness
too
sweet
for
me
actually
ended
drainpouring
the
last
little
bit
as
it
was
cloying
and
syrupy
pours
a
nice
traditional
pilsner
yellow
with
a
promising
foamy
head
which
unfortunately
quickly
dies
to
a
film
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
lemon
dish
soap
but
breaking
is
down
further
i
might
suggest
it
is
a
mix
of
lemon
grass
and
celery
which
would
be
expected
nonetheless
i
dont
find
it
particularly
welcoming
the
flavour
is
initially
rich
with
this
aroma
and
the
smooth
texture
helps
to
reinforce
the
idea
of
soapiness
its
not
unpleasant
but
again
not
something
that
im
really
looking
for
thankfully
after
a
while
this
settles
down
and
a
sweet
maltiness
takes
over
for
the
rest
of
the
ride
a
nice
level
of
floral
hoppy
bitterness
lurks
out
the
edges
helping
to
keep
this
pils
nice
and
refreshing
no
doubt
i
could
drink
another
of
these
to
quench
my
thirst
on
a
hot
day
but
whether
i
would
do
so
with
so
many
other
good
brew
available
is
unlikely
can
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
pils
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
some
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
medium
sweet
malt
with
some
nice
floral
notes
provided
by
the
hops
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
notes
of
sweet
malt
with
some
nice
hoppy
floral
notes
very
refreshing
overall
while
respecting
the
style
guideline
the
descriptor
on
the
can
says
their
brewmaster
visited
czechlosovakia
to
study
and
replicate
the
true
czech
pilsners
sorry
to
say
he
missed
the
mark
this
one
needs
lots
more
hop
character
and
depth
to
make
a
true
czech
pils
not
recommended
after
try
a
few
canadian
beers
from
the
can
i
must
admit
i
was
ready
to
judge
this
one
by
its
cover
id
tried
a
supposed
ipa
that
was
really
just
a
lager
with
hardly
any
hops
to
be
tasted
so
when
i
read
pilsner
on
the
side
of
this
can
i
got
worried
before
even
taking
the
first
sip
therefore
when
i
did
try
the
first
sip
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
does
taste
like
a
pilsner
unfortunately
after
a
few
more
sips
the
cloying
sweetness
sets
in
and
the
lack
of
hops
becomes
more
noticeable
overall
its
pretty
average
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
it
and
actually
ended
up
throwing
half
of
it
away
d
very
approachable
balanced
but
a
little
too
much
sweetness
for
me
a
very
clear
pale
straw
hue
in
the
glass
with
a
hint
of
amber
but
light
coloured
i
found
the
head
a
bit
soapy
at
first
with
large
bubbles
that
lingered
eventually
left
with
a
ring
of
froth
around
the
glass
and
a
few
clear
spots
here
and
there
the
carbonation
was
good
with
a
bit
of
staying
power
an
aroma
of
freshly
cut
grass
and
a
touch
of
balsa
wood
smooth
and
a
touch
foamy
in
the
mouth
with
pronounced
hops
dry
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
finish
surprized
me
balanced
bitterness
overall
im
impressed
for
this
style
of
brew
but
then
again
i
started
out
as
a
pilsner
drinker
years
ago
so
i
may
be
embellishing
a
little
taste
is
a
wellbalanced
bitterness
grapefruit
and
a
drop
of
honey
very
drinkable
and
very
surprising
i
had
pretty
well
assumed
that
this
would
be
a
bomb
considering
the
molson
purchase
im
glad
to
see
that
it
hasnt
yet
affected
the
output
of
the
brewery
that
said
it
doesnt
really
go
out
of
its
way
to
justify
being
a
special
edition
or
whatever
it
is
its
just
a
pilsner
im
not
a
pilsner
fan
generally
but
i
grabbed
a
couple
of
tall
cans
of
this
from
the
lcbo
just
to
try
it
out
for
a
pilsner
its
not
bad

a

note

pleasantly
hoppy
but
subtle
with
very
little
of
that
pilsner
funkskunkbeery
taste
that
i
dislike
nice
mouthfeel
although
a
little
more
carbonation
than
i
usually
like
in
a
beer
in
general
drinkable
and
would
be
great
to
have
a
few
of
these
outside
grilling
chicken
or
something
on
a
sunny
day
the
palate
is
sweet
malty
with
some
a
well
balanced
hop
profile
dry
and
bitter
finish
a
great
take
on
a
czech
pilsener
taste
is
a
bit
better
but
that
soapiness
is
still
lingering
a
bit
nice
grassy
peppery
hop
profile
though
and
theres
a
slight
nuttiness
to
the
grainy
malt
that
i
like
as
well
bitterness
is
clean
and
complimentary
not
overwhelming
body
isnt
too
light
or
anything
and
it
slides
down
pretty
easy
dry

carbonation
is
just
right
for
the
style
if
it
wasnt
for
that
unpleasant
soapy
note
in
the
aroma
and
in
the
taste
this
would
probably
be
above
average
for
me
but
as
it
stands
its
just
another
pilsner
pours
a
deep

its

right
up
there
with
some
of
my
favorite
pilsners
the
big
advantage
this
beer
has
is
that
it
tastes
so
fresh
recommended
this
is
in
no
way
a
traditional
pilsner
only
in
a
very
broad
sense
good
malty
aroma
it
was
soso
lagerish
up
front
and
decent
bitterness
on
back
like
a
maibock

me

and
overall
probably
because
so
fresh
and
new
a
decent

positive

beer
i
would
send
it
as
a
hitchhiker
but
not
worth
especially
trading
for
dry
aftertaste
d
i
like
this
a
lot
good
flavour
yet
still
refreshing
all
in
all
creemores
traditional
pilsner
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
other
major
ontario
pilsners
but
its
simplicity
is
also
its
strength
what
is
here
is
quite
tasty
and
i
would
take
it
over
king
pilsner
almost
any
day
creemores
flagship
lager
has
certainly
gone
downhill
in
the
past
year
but
this
is
a
nice
reminder
of
the
brewerys
potential
if
only
theyd
try
their
hands
at
a
stout
or
even
a
wheat
beer
the
answer
is
this
is
fresher
and
even
if
it
is
deficient
in
several
factors
as
a
tradtional
czech
pils
a
fresh
impersonator
is
better
than
a
stale
or
over
dated
authentic
import
does
it
unseat
king
pilsner
as
the
scientifically
validated
best
pilsner
in
ontario
in
my
opinion
i
think
it
may

body
i
brew
wine
from
scratch
and
from
kits
i
understand
that
brewing
beer
is
different
and
more
complicated
i
am
enjoying
learning
about
both
pale
golden
color
white
head
very
nice
aroma
better
than
some
pale
ales
not
much
hops
as
expected
easy
drinking
taste
malts
with
light
hops
present
this
is
a
pleasant
well
done
pilsener
and
is
faithful
to
the
style
but
personally
i
prefer
a
stronger
taste
which
is
why
i
dont
often
buy
pils
refreshing
to
drink
matches
up
well
against
the
classic
european
pilseners
i
recommend
it
to
those
who
are
looking
for
an
american
pilsener
good
beer
mf
3
6
fresh
clean
refreshing
would
have
again
o
at
4
5
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
session
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
it
wouldnt
be
the
most
exciting
session
o
unimpressed
with
this
pilsener
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
o
good
average
pilsener
made
for
summer
quenching
carry
on
citizens
o
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
id
buy
it
again
pilsners
arent
the
sexiest
style
of
beer
but
i
very
much
liked
drinking
summits
m
very
nice
mouthfeel
for
the
style
not
thin
at
all
noble
hop
flavor
stays
in
the
back
and
roof
of
mouth
and
throat
this
is
good
not
great
overall
its
a
pretty
good
pilsener
with
a
decent
flavor
feel
and
look
worth
a
try
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
d
basically
just
a
simple
craft
pils
all
around
its
insanely
drinkable
and
mild
but
also
lacks
depth
and
complexity
that
being
said
this
style
doesnt
typically
boast
the
most
complex
beers
anyways
some
reviews
on
here
imply
a
lack
of
hop
flavor
in
this
brew
but
i
certainly
taste
enough
to
qualify
this
as
a
czech
pilsener
a
tasty
and
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
at
worst
final
thoughts
im
not
sure
this
beer
deserves
the
status
of
being
a
yearround
brew
by
summit
it
does
the
job
but
definitely
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
more
however
this
beer
is
never
out
of
place
at
a
summer
picnic
or
backyard
barbecue
this
isnt
a
czech
urquell
but
its
pretty
damn
close
i
think
its
a
good
summer
beer
like
most
summit
beers
this
baby
goes
down
smooth
i
listened
to
some
great
ambient
music
by
erik
wollo
imaginary
landscapes
which
should
be
considered
a
classic
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
on
a
hot
summers
day
o
i
find
this
closer
to
a
german
pils
than
czech
though
the
hops
are
light
this
is
a
highly
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
but
the
lacking
malt
character
and
low
hop
character
in
the
flavor
plus
the
off
characters
keep
my
marks
low
pilsener
pours
a
typical
golden
color
with
a
nice
size
lasting
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
bubbles
the
smell
while
not
strong
did
have
skunk
like
qualities
the
taste
was
pleasant
rather
light
had
a
nice
mellow
straw
like
flavor
a
few
hops
and
was
actually
a
bit
sweet
but
the
aftertaste
isnt
that
great
while
easy
to
drink
that
aftertaste
would
stop
me
from
getting
more
overall
a
pretty
nice
pils
nothing
spectacular
but
has
some
good
qualities
o
blah
o
a
well
made
simple
pilsners
pretty
standard
but
pretty
good
overall
its
a
beer
that
youd
drink
when
youre
fishing
with
your
buddies
over
the
weekend
its
not
an
awful
beer
but
there
are
much
better
pilsner
brews
out
there
overall
a
pretty
average
pilsner
that
suffers
from
lack
of
peppy
saaz
hop
flavors
and
a
lackluster
nose
honestly
id
take
becks
or
bitburgur
over
this
any
day
but
for
10
for
the
12bottle
variety
pack
its
hard
to
complain
i
would
buy
the
variety
pack
from
summit
again
and
happily
drink
these
but
cant
really
see
myself
purchasing
just
this
i
shared
this
beer
with
a
friend
who
only
drinks
macro
beers
and
he
was
apprehensive
the
summit
pils
would
have
way
too
much
flavor
after
tasting
the
pils
he
agreed
hed
still
rather
drink
his
corona
or
bud
lite
but
was
quick
to
admit
that
there
wasnt
a
great
deal
more
flavor
in
the
summit
pils
than
what
he
normally
enjoys
in
bmc
sadly
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that
assessment
notes
light
and
crisp
yet
has
enough
flavor
to
make
up
for
it
creamy
mouthfeel
makes
this
pils
quite
easy
to
knock
back
not
my
favorite
brew
summit
has
to
offer
but
a
solid
effort
nonetheless
overall
pretty
standard
not
a
ton
going
on
here
drinkability
a
tasty
brew
nothing
too
complex
or
pretentious
straightforward
and
flavorful
drinking
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
either
for
me
to
be
a
toptier
pilsner
it
needs
to
have
the
crisp
hop
bite
summit
pilsener
does
not
have
this
as
it
is
more
malt
driven
having
said
that
i
enjoyed
this
overall
and
would
gladly
have
again
in
the
future
the
final
beer
at
bliss
today
one
that
wasnt
really
part
of
the
tasting
you
gotta
love
these
guys
right
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
fluffy
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
lemon
rind
wheat
grass
and
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
this
sameness
is
then
invaded
by
a
rather
unexpected
horde
of
corn
the
floral
hop
notes
helped
to
stem
the
tide
a
bit
but
ultimately
their
effort
was
in
vain
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
pils
but
the
cornyness
didnt
set
well
with
me
frankly
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
classified
as
a
czech
pils
considering
the
lack
of
hoppy
bitterness
id
probably
drink
one
o
these
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
pilsener
from
summit
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
is
well
balanced
o
another
solid
offering
from
summit
the
brewery
is
one
of
my
favorites
for
their
other
offerings
but
while
solid
this
one
doesnt
compare
with
others
in
same
catagory
pilsner
urquell
and
sanp
have
my
vote
there
hard
to
find
myself
drinking
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
because
of
this
i
find
this
to
be
a
really
good
pilsner
great
complexity
in
the
flavor
while
maintaining
that
refreshing
crispness
and
dryness
dang
this
is
good
very
refreshing
and
ideal
for
the
sweltering
minnesota
summer
of
the
three
my
order
of
preference
is
1
pilsner
urquel
2
czechvar
and
3
summit
bohemian
style
pilsner
the
summit
and
czechvar
are
so
close
that
it
comes
down
to
a
matter
of
preferences
if
you
want
a
little
more
of
the
bohemian
malt
flavor
and
saaz
hops
then
go
with
the
czechvar
taste
wise
i
think
the
czechvar
wins
but
if
appearance
is
more
important
to
you
go
with
the
summit
if
you
want
a
cleaner
tasting
lawn
mower
beer
the
summit
is
great
cold
drinkability
probably
one
of
my
least
favorite
of
the
summit
line
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
its
pretty
unremarkable
for
the
pils
style
i
like
the
local
august
schells
pils
much
better
beer
is
thin
and
watery
with
a
grainy
aftertaste
and
a
biting
minor
bitterness
with
a
mild
aftertaste
the
beer
is
pretty
disappointing
a
below
average
pilsner
pours
a
sparkling
golden
color
with
a
good
fizzy
white
head
that
leaves
some
sparse
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
a
lot
of
grain
and
some
bread
along
with
that
are
some
light
floral
and
herbal
hops
the
grain
takes
over
the
flavor
as
well
barely
even
leaving
room
for
the
slight
amount
of
bready
malt
some
mild
herbal
and
floral
hops
in
the
background
light
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
bad
but
quite
average
needs
more
noble
hops
andor
less
graininess
overall
this
beer
would
be
a
ton
times
better
if
it
didnt
have
so
much
skunk
flavor
it
was
fine
otherwise
very
easy
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
was
average
not
great
so
many
other
pils
to
choose
from
that
this
one
gets
lost
as
a
choice
for
me
it
drinkable
summit
pilsener
was
golden
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
noble
hops
and
some
grain
the
taste
was
light
malt
grain
and
hops
it
had
a
dry
lightly
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
decent
pilsener
and
worth
a
shot
by
far
summits
weakest
beer
not
terrible
but
not
all
that
enjoyable
nor
is
it
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
this
is
not
my
style
at
all
but
i
think
this
is
a
very
solid
pilsner
easy
enough
to
drink
and
actually
has
a
pretty
good
hop
dose
for
the
style
as
well
the
feel
was
very
silky
and
smooth
the
carbonation
didnt
bother
it
any
as
it
was
very
mild
not
watery
by
any
stretch
but
very
easy
to
drink
the
finish
was
extraordinarily
clean
overall
just
ok
it
was
left
in
my
fridge
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
not
my
favorite
summit
but
not
bad
good
drinkability
as
well
a
nice
example
of
the
style
dim
noticing
a
trend
with
summits
lagers
they
tend
to
be
on
the
low
end
of
the
carbonation
spectrum
normally
i
dont
find
this
to
be
a
problem
with
beers
in
general
i
actually
prefer
it
most
of
the
time
but
with
these
lagers
it
comes
across
as
a
something
i
really
miss
that
coupled
with
the
complete
lack
of
bitterness
for
me
make
this
beer
a
miss
notes
not
a
bad
beer
that
is
fairly
refreshing
fairly
hoppy
and
spicy
and
less
malty
than
some
others
in
the
style
pretty
tasty
on
a
hot
day
if
you
want
a
cheaper
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
good
pours
a
palemedium
golden
with
a
nice
big
head
of
foam
that
slowly
fades
leaving
significant
lacing
nice
aroma
if
a
little
faint
featurning
hops
and
malt
in
fairly
equal
proportion
taste
is
a
bit
less
bold
than
i
would
have
hoped
for
with
moderate
hops
flavor
in
the
fore
but
not
much
maltiness
at
all
decent
mouth
feel
that
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
was
still
decent
overall
a
nice
drinkable
lager
that
would
be
especially
good
for
hot
weather
d
this
is
a
worthy
offering
for
the
style
though
i
have
had
better
makes
for
a
tasty
drink
on
a
hot
summers
day
and
i
would
never
turn
one
down
if
offered
d
another
good
brew
from
summit
lighter
bodied
brew
that
i
would
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
i
recommend
this
brew
md
lighter
body
higher
carbonation
that
has
some
tingle
drinkability
is
good
very
easy
to
drink
its
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
a
gateway
beer
for
a
non
craft
drinker
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
representation
fo
the
style
consumed
on
a
hot
day
been
wroking
outside
all
day
and
needed
somthing
to
freshen
up
with
well
here
it
is
d
the
mineral
addition
going
on
is
a
lot
to
try
and
handle
in
this
beer
it
needs
some
toning
down
then
everything
might
fall
into
place
better
a
very
sessionable
beer
indeed
just
ok
not
the
best
pilsner
in
the
world
but
certainly
better
and
more
flavorful
than
what
most
of
this
world
calls
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
slow
pour
left
no
head
there
was
some
lacing
after
the
first
few
sips
the
color
is
a
pure
yellow
wheat
color
the
smell
reminded
me
of
that
too
like
wheat
fields
in
late
summerearly
fall
nice
and
comforting
this
is
something
my
grandfather
a
non
experimenting
guy
wouldve
drank
its
not
bad
its
just
that
it
has
a
traditional
pilsner
taste
to
it
a
beer
taste
if
you
will
there
was
some
bitterness
on
the
tongue
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
which
would
would
lead
to
pretty
high
drinkability
although
after
a
couple
id
want
something
with
more
taste
nothing
extraordinary
here
but
certainly
nothing
bad
this
beer
has
pleasant
flavors
and
is
highly
drinkable
a
dangerous
combination
indeed
lacks
a
bit
of
saaz
sass
but
a
good
crossover
beer
overall
impression
nice
drinkable
beer
not
sure
this
belongs
in
the
autumn
variety
pack
though
seems
to
be
a
much
better
fit
for
summer
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
pils
its
lightness
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
on
a
warm
day
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
ah
much
more
lupulin
goodness
in
the
flavor
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
some
husky
graininess
and
a
fairly
intense
grassy
hop
bitterness
there
are
a
few
rough
edges
to
the
beer
but
all
in
all
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
very
tasty
pilsner
i
like
it
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
well
done
summit
d
a
decent
beer
but
i
tend
to
like
my
pilsner
a
bit
more
crisp
and
dry
id
have
it
again
but
probably
not
two
in
the
same
sitting
this
lacks
a
bit
of
finesse
to
call
it
a
classic
example
but
it
works
d
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
czech
pils
style
well
done
and
easy
drinking
di
had
a
higher
expectations
for
this
one
coming
from
summit
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
just
not
enough
balance
and
too
much
dry
hop
bitterness
d
a
solid
if
unspectacular
pilsner
from
a
consistently
good
brewery
i
think
this
is
the
same
beer
as
the
old
summit
grand
at
least
i
cant
tell
the
difference
between
them
nice
grassy
pilsner
and
a
good
thirst
quencher
d
great
session
beer
can
just
keep
on
doing
it
i
also
give
it
points
for
appealing
to
the
masses
particularly
bmc
drinkers
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
has
plenty
of
grains
some
light
citrus
and
grassy
hops
pretty
nice
but
not
too
strong
the
taste
is
very
nice
lots
of
grains
and
wheat
some
nice
grassy
hops
and
light
citrus
maybe
a
little
coriander
and
bit
of
pepper
the
mouth
is
medium
feels
light
and
airy
with
good
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
very
very
easy
to
drink
this
case
went
by
fast
fairly
simple
yet
complex
enough
to
still
be
interesting
after
youve
had
a
few
and
light
enough
so
as
not
to
weight
one
down
glad
to
see
a
wellmade
pils
from
an
american
craft
brewery
might
not
be
perfect

but
a

im
sure
this
pilsner
helps
summits
sales
and
it
is
refreshing
wont
lure
me
away
from
the
extra
pale
very
approachable
beer
nice
example
of
the

that

tangy

pilsner
with

foamy

with

is
also
dominated
by
some
grainy

with

body
is
about

with
good

not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
here
but
this
was
not
the
most
pleasant
and
i
had
hard
time
finishing
a
single
bottle
which
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
considering
the
style
o
well
the
mouthfeel
certainly
makes
this
pretty
pedestrian
beer
something
special
and
unique
at
least
from
what
ive
had
of
pilsners
i
dont
know
if
this
is
something
im
really
going
to
want
to
drink
often
but
it
at
least
takes
risks
and
is
memorable
in
a
style
where
being
forgettable
seems
acceptable
overall
really
grassy
bright
citrusy
o
all
i
tasted
was
hops
which
can
be
a
positive
feature
in
a
beer
when
partnered
along
other
features
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
i
was
hoping
for
more
flavor
from
this
beer
overall
simple
but
very
drinkable
a
few
features
which
make
this
one
interesting
but
definitely
hop
deficient
even
for
the
style

excellent

one
of
the
best
offerings
ive
had
from
the
saint
louis
brewery
a
great
fresh
pilsner
light
and
refreshing
while
still
tasting
good
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
put
a
few
back
while
doing
anything
outside
o
this
is
a
quality
czechstyle
pilsner
made
by
a
very
reliable
brewery
i
could
see
this
being
an
excellent
transition
from
macro
lagers
to
both
craft
beers
and
some
of
the
classic
european
styles
this
is
very
much
worth
trying
o
nice
pilsner
not
bad
for
the
style
worth
a
try
its
drinkable
but
has
more
after
taste
is
a
little
more
sour
and
is
not
as
light
bodied
as
id
like
to
have
in
a
good
german
or
czech
style
pilsner
i
prefer
schlaflys

light
pale
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
and
a
nice
streaming
carbonation
from
the
bottom
smell
was
very
yeasty
with
the
classic
lager
smell
hints
of
a
slight
hoppiness
could
be
detected
first
impression
of
the
taste
was
light
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
flavors
are
atypical
of
the
style
and
nothing
exceptional
poured
this
german
pilsner
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
pilsener
poured
a
clear
golden
color
produced
a
average
white
head
and
it
had
good
retention
lacing
was
nice
the
aroma
of
the
pilsner
had
a
nice
malt
base
notes
of
bread
and
a
surprisingly
strong
hop
presence
for
a
pilsner
one
of
the
finest
smelling
pilsners
that
this
nose
has
come
across
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
light
in
body
very
crisp
excellent
mouthfeel
there
is
a
very
strong
malt
base
that
lays
the
foundation
to
herbal
notes
grain
and
hops
possibly
the
best
american
brewed
pilsener
that
i
have
tried
to
this
point
very
well
balanced
great
session
beer
nice
to
see
a
craft
brewer
produce
a
decent
pilsner
budweiser
may
be
king
in
st
louis
but
the
king
doesnt
have
anything
on
this
beer
overallnotes
pilsners
have
been
growing
on
me
over
the
last
few
months
this
and
polestar
both
have
made
me
reevaluate
my
mum
opinion
on
them
and
with
the
weather
consistently
hitting
the
90s
might
i
say
that
my
adjustment
is
right
on
time
very
good
pilsner
thatd
be
great
for
a
barbeque
flavor
is
surprisingly
crisp
with
a
definite
hop
bitterness
i
expected
an
overlymalted
adjunctstyle
lager
but
this
one
impressed
me
a
refreshing
and
delicious
lighter
beer
and
one
of
the
best
nongerman
pilsners
ive
had
in
some
time
refreshing
drinkability
pretty
sessionable
with
no
significant
flaws
i
tend
to
like
pilsners
that
showcase
more
noble
hop
aroma
or
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
though
and
this
one
is
a
little
bit
lacking
in
substance
i
think
it
leans
more
toward
being
an
american
pilsner
with
its
grainy
aroma
flavor
give
it
a
try
though
being
that
i
live
20
minutes
from
st
louis
and
schlafly
is
everywhere
this
may
be
one
of
my
choice
bbq
beers
this
summer
its
also
nice
because
its
good
and
it
doesnt
hit
the
wallet
hard
like
a
lot
of
beers
drinkability
this
brew
would
be
outstanding
during
the
summer
months
while
at
a
cookout
very
easy
drinking
not
overly
complex
just
a
good
solid
enjoyable
beer
worth
a
try
just
for
the
fun
of
drinking
it
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
naturally
easy
to
put
back
but
an
incredibly
refreshing
and
wonderfully
tasty
with
the
temperature
uncommonly
high
at
the
moment
this
hit
the
spot
a
decent
thin
crispness
and
leaves
the
palate
moist
makes
for
a
decent
pils
but
it
seems
more
of
a
czech
style
to
me
standard
pilsner
give
it
to
me
baby
schlafly
didnt
get
crazy
with
this
beer
nor
did
it
have
to

thin

not

gives
this

a

no
questions
give
it
to
me
all
night
long
d
this
beer
is
good
damn
good
i
was
very
surprised
with
this
one
as
not
only
is
it
flavorful
but
the
abv
is
so
low
you
can
drink
it
all
night
long
schlafly
made
a
great
tasting
and
drinking
beer
with
this
one
what
you
get
here
is
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
brew
thats
refreshing
and
satisfying
an
excellent
example
of
the
pilsner
style

truly
digging
this

and
look

overall
a
solid
pilsner
beer
nice
to
see
this
style
from
a
craft
brewery
crisp
and
refreshing
good
stuff
overall
a
solid
example
of
a
pilsner
really
enjoyed
the
beer
and
wish
schlafly
would
ship
to
where
i
live
very
pale
yellow
small
white

recedes
quickly
but
clings
to
the
glass
wonderfull
hop
aroma
is
grassy
and
citrusy
initial
taste
is
all
hop
bitterness
but
a
sweet
malt
flavor
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
lots
of
citrusy
hop
flavor
as
well
a
nice
take
on
the
german
style
pilsner
with
more
hop
flavor
and
less
malt
flavor
then
most
all
in
all
a
superb
pilsner
fresh
and
clean
all
over
the
balance
is
there
without
a
doubt
and
a
modest
level
of
alcohol
is
great
considering
how
drinkable
it
is
what
could
go
better
with
this
than
grilled
brats
kraut
and
baked
beans
very
enjoyable
overall
a
nice
pilsener
though
i
have
had
better
still
something
that
is
worth
a
try
good
choice
for
a
summer
day
d
this
is
a
decent
germanstyle
pilsner
its
very
clean
and
has
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
however
the
bitterness
falls
a
bit
short
of
what
i
would
typically
expect
of
the
style
which
is
more
in
line
with
a
helles
but
the
hop
flavor
itself
is
a
bit
strong
for
a
helles
nonetheless
id
drink
another
if
i
had
one
as
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
especially
on
a
hot
day
like
this
taste
almost
no
taste
very
subtle
lots
of
water
minimal
noble
hops
maybe
very
little
lots
of
bubbles
doesnt
evolve
or
denigrate
just
a
beer
that
is
light
all
the
way
around
couldnt
differentiate
between
this
pilsner
and
a
light
beer
d
goes
down
very
easy
not
filling
not
much
of
a
kick
but
a
nice
representation
of
a
style
this
really
just
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
humid
st
louis
day
somewhat
dry
but
crisp
palate
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
pretty
runofthemill
mouthfeel
was
ok
drinkability
was
still
good
after
drinking
noble
pils
serveral
times
and
going
back
to
this
one
the
schlafly
actually
held
up
pretty
well
good
pils
drinkability
love
the
taste
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
up
poured
12oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
slightly
hazy
light
straw
body
with
a
fizzy
white
head
2
fingers
quickly
reducing
bready
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
toasted
grain
grass
and
lemon
moderately
sweet
and
lightly
bitter
flavor
that
finishes
moderately
bitter
and
a
bit
acidic
slightly
dry
good
balance
very
enjoyable
lager
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
pilsners
i
have
ever
had
the
hops
are
perfect
and
there
but
not
overpowering
this
is
light
and
most
likely
has
a
lower
abv
i
plan
on
killing
this
growler
fairly
quickly
and
i
will
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
it
great
fresh
mouthfeel
and
great
drinkability
d
absolutely
drinkable
easy
to
drink
i
could
session
this
a
good
pills
better
than
the
other
one
that
comes
from
that
town
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
with
a
lingering
foamy
white
head
nose
of
toasted
grains
and
bright
clean
citrus
hops
orange
and
grapefruit
zest
flavors
on
top
of
a
strong
grainy
bread
backbone
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
short
clean
finish
eversoslightly
round
on
the
palate
but
pleasantly
crisp
on
the
whole
im
quite
impressed
this
is
difficult
i
dont
often
drink
lagers
but
then
i
view
reviewing
as
part
of
my
beerlearningexperience
thick
white
foamy
head
that
recedes
to
an
18th
inch
cap
virtually
no
lacing
i
see
a
goldenyellow
crystal
clear
body
with
tiny
bubbles
slowly
making
their
way
to
the
surface
the
nose
is
not
forward
at
all
it
takes
some
concentration
from
me
to
sniff
up
some
subtle
breadiness
and
an
herbal
hop
aroma
flavorwise
schlafly
pilsner
is
quite
enjoyable
for
its
crisp
slightly
sharp
yet
balanced
flavors
i
find
a
slight
grainy
sweetness
in
the
mid
palate
that
works
nicely
with
the
sharpness
that
is
probably
contributed
by
the
hops
i
am
left
with
a
nice
quiet
bitterness
i
find
the
mouthfeel
to
be
light
and
lively
contributing
to
an
ease
in
drinking
strictly
average
there
are
the
barest
hints
of
flavor
that
differentiate
this
clearly
from
something
golden
tasteless
but
theres
nothing
here
to
write
home
about
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
moderate
white
head
slight
hop
aroma
of
citrus
and
hay
well
balanced
kind
of
dry
with
dry
crisp
finish
decent
offering
but
in
a
blind
taste
test
would
not
alter
much
from
a
miller
lite
coors
original
or
budweiser
there
is
some
body
but
not
much
pretty
light
and
grainy
to
me
not
a
classic
pilsener
average
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
reading
through
other
reviews
some
people
say
it
has
a
grassy
aroma
and
i
can
see
that
the
only
way
i
can
describe
the
smell
is
a
macro
mixed
with
heineken
heh
taste
the
taste
is
pretty
refreshing
very
similar
to
the
smell
and
i
really
cant
put
my
finger
on
what
the
exact
taste
is
however
it
isnt
bad
at
all
im
not
familiar
with
many
pilsners
so
im
not
sure
what
they
are
supposed
to
taste
like
and
what
not
but
im
going
to
say
this
is
at
least
a
decent
pilsner
based
upon
other
reviews
and
from
what
ive
tasted
i
will
begin
by
saying
that
i
usually
shy
away
from
pilsners
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
the
color
was
a
pale
gold
and
very
clear
after
being
poured
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
a
light
froth
head
the
nose
was
grain
heavy
with
a
little
wheat
type
characteristics
just
a
faint
bit
of
hops
on
the
nose
the
flavor
was
pretty
consistent
with
the
nose
as
the
grain
dominated
the
flavor
but
a
subtle
touch
of
hops
carried
throughout
it
was
a
pretty
ordinary
beer
but
the
little
bit
of
bite
that
the
grains
and
hops
provided
kept
it
micro
appropriate
d
easily
drinkable
i
wont
be
rushing
back
to
this
anytime
soon
unless
i
find
it
on
tap
somewhere
good
example
of
the
style
just
not
great
d
for
sure
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
the
flavor
is
full
and
features
many
subtleties
and
is
deftly
balanced
very
well
made
indeed
d
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
brew
from
a
brewer
that
i
normally
hold
in
very
high
regard
oh
well
not
everyone
is
at
the
top
of
their
game
all
of
the
time
its
not
terrible
its
just
not
as
good
as
i
expected
from
a
brewery
that
specializes
in
all
things
german
o
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
while
it
tastes
very
good
its
not
as
true
to
the
style
as
i
had
hoped
easy
drinker
not
a
bad
pils
more
malt
depth
or
hops
wouldve
helped
the
cause
its
not
my
favorite
by
my
local
brewery
but
its
a
good
alternative
if
im
not
in
the
mood
for
a
lot
of
hops
in
my
beer
give
it
a
try
sample
at
the
bottleworks
location
while
in
st
louis
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
color

head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves

rings

and

there

light
grainy
aftertaste
okay
a
light
tasting
grainy
beer
sample
at
the
brewpub
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
medium
thin
ivory
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
thin
rings
of
lacing
mild
hops
and
bready
malt
in
the
nose
lightbodied
and
clean
with
grassy
hops
and
grainy
malt
flavors
with
a
touch
of
fruit
in
the
background
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
hops
with
a
short
hops
aftertaste
fairly
uninteresting
overall
dvery
good
representation
of
the
style
no
off
flavors
d
seems
like
a
great
drink
on
a
warm
day
a
very
refreshing
clean
taste
would
go
well
with
brats
also
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
bmc
lover
perfectly
clear
golden
body
with
a
light
head
but
good
retention
very
strong
fresh
grainy
aroma
flavor
isnt
as
strong
as
the
aroma
but
still
solid
mostly
grainy
with
some
minimal
hops
in
the
background
and
mild
malts
drier
mouthfeel
fairly
light
and
drinkable
solid
beer
even
though
pilsners
arent
my
favorite
drinkability
is
fairly
high
its
a
decent
pils
and
certainly
easy
to
consume
drinkability
is
nice
this
is
a
simple
lager
without
anything
that
stands
out
but
nicely
proportioned
with
a
solid
profile
the
last
beer
i
sampled
at
their
tap
room
with
my
woman
in
july
08
poured
out
of
the
tap
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
white
head
one
finger
thick
dissipated
after
a
minute
to
a
thin
ring
moderate
lacing
the
aromas
were
vaguely
floral
and
grainy
ill
defined
but
appealing
flavors
began
with
some
malt
then
a
german
yeast
flavor
with
understated
hops
at
the
end
light
carbonation
and
a
watery
light
body
smooth
to
the
point
of
being
boring
a
good
nonthinking
brew
sessionable
but
not
much
to
write
home
about
pours
very
clear
with
a
small
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
some
grains
true
to
its
style
it
was
crisp
and
light
it
tastes
of
the
sweet
malts
that
i
smelled
and
had
a
light
hop
finish
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
very
light
and
refreshing
which
makes
it
great
for
warmer
days
i
have
however
decided
that
german
beers
are
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
d
this
is
a
nice
pils
it
makes
for
a
nice
session
brew
great
after
yet
another
loss
in
softball
md
light
and
refreshing
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
had
4
or
5
of
these
while
eating
dinner
at
the
bottleworks
though
nothing
that
will
blow
you
away
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
would
probably
be
a
good
one
to
introduce
to
your
macrodrinking
friends
this
is
immensely
quaffable
and
with
a
low
abv
this
will
be
a
staple
for
the
summer
months
my
friend
got
one
of
their
three
gallon
kegs
you
can
get
one
in
any
of
their
styles
and
i
had
about
for
or
five
pints
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
thanks
xmarcnolanx
for
the
opportunity
light
to
medium
gold
pour
with
a
bubbly
body
to
it
and
a
nice
white
head
in
a
pilsner
glass
spicy
malt
smell
and
mild
earthiness
taste
is
hearty
malt
very
low
yeast
flavor
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
or
bite
but
very
nice
flavor
very
drinkable
and
almost
with
notes
of
wheatcorn
at
times
i
like
this
one
d
its
almost
like
schafly
was
trying
too
hard
if
ya
know
what
i
mean
all
the
elements
of
a
good
pilsner
are
here
but
its
too
in
your
face
and
the
hop
bitterness
too
much
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
and
to
be
fair
this
is
a
tough
style
to
do
well
but
it
wont
be
replacing
trumer

my
fridge

the

providing
an
understated

to
support
the
dominant
earthy

very
nicely
done
this
one
is
quite
sessionable

i
didnt

are
both
ok
it
smells
like
honey

and
some

it
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
way
it
smells
except
theres
also
some
breadgrain
noticable
in
the
taste
too
slight

mouthfeel
is
medium
with
there
being
a

drinkability
is
good
its
nice
and
crisp

i
think
its
a
pretty
decent

ill
have
to
try
it

its

i
really

overall
this
pilsner
has
alot
of
flavor
some
people
have
described
it
as
boring
but
i
have
found
it
has
good
balance
and
is
a
pleasent
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp

definitely
drinkable

a

and

schlafly
can
do
better
d
an

pilsner
the
guys
across
town
at
ab
should
take
notes
on
what
the
style
could
taste
like
a
likable
beer
balanced
and
flavorful
with
a
moderate
abv
certainly
one
id
have
again
thanks
james
drinkability
another
ordinary
pilsner
with
nothing
to
help
it
really
stand
out
among
the
crowd
as
youd
expect
with
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
not
my
first
choice
but
its
appropriate
and
it
works
in
context
drinkability
is
high
although
the
bitterness
might
be
too
much
for
the
macrolager
crowd
even
so
its
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
the
beer
pours
a
nice
straw
yellow
color
with
fantastic
clarity
there
is
a
2
finger
frothy
foam
over
top
there
is
a
great
bubble
of
carbonation
coming
up
through
the
body
of
the
beer
this
is
a
nice
looking
brew
the
aroma
is
a
little
faint
i
get
a
honeykissed
pilsner
sweetness
with
just
a
hint
of
grassy
hop
i
could
use
a
little
stronger
aroma
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
as
teh
aroma
lots
of
sweetness
with
just
a
mild
grassyness
it
hits
lightly
bitter
on
the
finish
as
well
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
lighter
carbonation
as
it
seems
all
the
bubble
has
worked
out
of
solution
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
and
not
a
bad
rendition
it
is
a
bit
astringet
on
the
finish
even
i
would
have
it
again
pours
a
nice
clean
golden
color
with
a
monstrous
tight
white
head
that
persists
carbonation
bubbles
are
alive
in
the
tall
pilsner
glass
the
nose
is
of
floral
hops
offset
by
a
nice
semisweet
maltiness
no
skunky
nose
here
in
this
pilsner
the
palate
is
floral
and
herbal
up
front
with
a
nice
smooth
malt
background
creating
a
very
good
balance
in
this
beer
the
flavors
are
subtle
but
they
are
there
unlike
the
pilsneresque
beers
you
find
so
often
from
the
macro
brewers
the
taste
is
unchallenging
but
full
and
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
active
and
the
beer
finishes
refreshingly
dry
not
overly
bitter
this
is
a
very
very
drinkable
pilsner
i
think
one
of
the
better
domestic
examples
of
the
german
style
this
beer
has
become
one
of
my
staple
beers
as
of
late
i
try
to
keep
it
around
at
all
times
since
it
is
so
userfriendly
and
versatile
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
grab
when
you
just
want
a
beer
kind
of
a
table
beer
if
you
will
coming
from
me
this
is
a
hell
of
an
endorsement
as
the
pilsner
style
is
not
one
that
gets
me
too
excited
well
done
mr
schlafly
good
body
and
ample
carbontaion
pretty
refreshing
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
but
pretty
drinkable
cant
believe
this
is
the
first
pilsner
from
them
but
im
also
going
for
other
brews
from
the
stouts
to
the
seasonals
dont
turn
away
from
this
one
if
you
like
pilsners
german
that
is
great

with
love

i
love
em

this
was
almost
a

the

a
good
americanized
version
of
the
pilsener

helps
itself
by
having

generous

a
more

satisfactory
amount

it
may
not
satisfy
those
would
put

adherence
at

just

no

how
that
goal
is
reached
impressive
pilsner
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
from
this
brewery
i
was
surprised
with
the
quality
of
the
brew
very
firm
pilsner
malt
base
that
shows
much
more
maltiness
than
graininess
the
malts
remain
consistent
and
substantiated
from
beginning
to

thanks
beer
dave
this
is
fine
example
of
a
pilsner
i
consider
this
a
great
session
beer
i
just
wish
schlaflys
brewery
was
closer
to
me
this
is
a
fine
beer
the
appearance
is
like
a
typical
pilsner
but
with
a
slightly
golden
hue
there
was
a
thick
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
a
little
like
a
wheat
and
had
me
concerned
but
it
is
good
for
the
style
the
taste
is
among
the
best
pilsners
i
have
had
there
is
no
harsh
corny
taste
this
beer
is
a
must
try
for
the
lighter
beer
drinker
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
i
could
session
this
beer
for
sure
too
bad
it
is
nat
marketed
here
i
may
have
to
obtain
more
of
this
a
mild
pils
that
is
a
great
summertime
quaffer
mouthfeel
was
smooth
medium
body
quite
drinkable
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
large
frothy
head
with
nice
retention
when
the
head
finally
did
decide
to
lay
down
it
left
only
a
moderate
lace
color
is
a
bright
clear
golden
yellow
smell
is
a
little
weak
hard
to
pick
up
anything
really
noticable
there
is
some
malt
and
yeast
notes
taste
is
a
pleasant
lemony
flavor
not
very
complex
a
little
bit
pepper
mouthfeel
was
light
and
watery
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
compared
to
the
initial
head
not
bad
over
all
but
doesnt
really
keep
my
attention
easily
one
of
the
best
pils
ive
had
the
balance
is
outstanding
in
a
very
good
way
a
beer
can
be
called
balanced
when
nothing
really
shines
through
this
one
is
balanced
because
you
taste
everything
in
equal
proportions
im
glad
to
have
them
distributed
here
so
i
can
pick
up
more
of
this
wonderful
brew
good
easy
drinking
beer
as
a
pils
should
be
probably
the
best
pilsner
i
have
ever
had
this
is
truely
a
super
beer
in
my
experience
pilsners
are
usually
not
very
exciting
with
slight
but
insignificant
variations
of
flavor
the
desired
end
result
of
pilsners
most
often
leans
to
drinkability
but
this
one
is
different
it
fires
on
all
fronts
starting
with
the
pour
which
is
golden
and
bright
but
hazy
with
a
lingering
head
great
bread
aroma
man
this
is
good
its
teeming
with
enormous
grainy
flavors
and
the
thick
malty
bread
continues
along
with
faint
organic
seasonings
and
spice
all
the
way
through
the
bottom
of
my
glass
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
and
citrus
twinge
an
awesome
mediumbodied
refreshing
brew
which
will
have
permanent
spot
in
my
fridge
from
now
on
lightmedium
body
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
above
average
pilsner
well
worth
a
try
what
a
great
fucking
beer
doesnt
go
down
by
the
tankertruck
full
like
some
better
pilsners
do
but
props
to
this
brewery
putting
out
a
damned
fine
example
of
a
style
that
doesnt
get
enough
respect
perfectly
dry
with
an
excellent
balance
between
sweet
grain
and
bitter
hops
this
is
a
grand
example
of
its
style
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
too
i
hate
to
be
so
redundant
on
my
numerical
ratings
but
that
is
pretty
much
how
i
feel
about
the
beer
i
have
had
this
beer
on
numerous
occasions
in
bottle
form
and
twice
on
tap
and
have
never
been
disappointed
the
appearance
was
the
appropriate
pale
golden
color
for
the
style
i
found
the
body
to
be
light
but
not
watery
and
it
finished
with
a
nice
hoppy
note
it
also
had
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
not
excessive
my
only
criticisms
of
the
beer
would
be
what
i
have
seen
in
some
of
the
other
reviews
for
this
beer
that
it
could
use
a
little
more
hops
in
the
finish
and
just
a
tad
more
body
but
i
tend
to
drink
more
ales
than
lagers
great
summer
beer
and
it
doesnt
get
that
excessivly
skunky
taste
you
get
with
the
imports
that
come
in
those
damn
green
bottles
i
live
in
st
louis
and
it
surprises
me
that
schlafly
doesnt
market
this
beer
more
agressively
in
local
supermarkets
during
the
summer
i
am
always
surprised
at
how
many
in
the
local
area
have
their
rasberry
hefe
and
their
american
pale
but
not
the
pilsner
other
than
the
victory
prima
pils
this
is
the
best
of
its
style
that
ive
tried
in
six
months
very
crisp
and
clean
easy
to
drink
all
day
and
nice
appearance
golden
colored
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
after
a
few
disappointing
ones
form
schlafly
this
one
hits
the
spot
this
beer
is
often
sited
as
being
the
best
of
the
regular
taps
at
schlafly
the
newer
apa
has
become
a
favorite
of
mine
but
this
is
still
a
strong
offering
it
poured
from
the
growler
a
nice
straw
colored
gold
topped
by
a
creamy
white
head
the
head
receded
slowly
and
left
a
nice
light
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
light
aroma
of
hoe
flower
and
citrus
possibly
a
little
mown
hay
the
flavor
has
a
mild
bitterness
early
in
the
flavor
with
some
rich
applepear
character
middrink
the
finish
has
a
lingering
bitterness
mildly
slick
mouth
feel
nice
drinkability
overall
very
nice
pilsener
wont
get
much
imported
thats
this
tasty
well
at
least
that
makes
the
long
boat
ride
love
it
good
mouthfeel
that
tends
more
towards
the
dryness
of
a
german
pils
than
the
softness
of
czech
examples
no
beer
has
benefitted
more
from
schlaflys
increased
capacity
and
ability
to
bottle
beers
that
it
brews
rather
than
contracting
them
out
this
beer
has
gone
from
very
ordinary
to
one
of
the
better
examples
made
in
this
country
clear
gold
in
hue
it
is
on
the
pale
side
of
things
there
is
a
steady
stream
of
animation
that
lazily
dances
to
the
fluffy
white
head
at
the
apex
the
foam
reached
about
two
fingers
in
height
the
head
retention
was
excellent
and
the
subsequent
lacing
was
webby
clumpy
and
widespread
overall
this
beer
looks
fairly
normal
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
the
nose
really
lacks
in
potency
it
says
something
to
the
effect
of
im
a
pils

there
is
a
rounded
breadiness
and
soft
spicy
herbal
hops
with
a
kiss
of
lemon
lime
saaz
it
is
a
shame
it
is
not
more
articulate
i
cant
call
in
inviting
lethargic
is
a
more
fitting
description
the
palate
really
isnt
much
better
then
the
nose
sure
it
is
tasty
but
it
is
too
weak
the
best
micro
pils
ive
had
was
new
glarus
edelpils
there
was
some
assertiveness
to
that
beer
not
so
much
with
this
one
minimal
bitterness
the
hop
flavors
are
herbal
rounded
with
kisses
of
spiciness
too
bad
it
is
far
to
weak
to
be
relevant
the
malt
offers
itself
in
a
bready
lightly
toasty
fashion
again
the
flavors
are
too
subtle
to
make
a
point
this
is
a
facsimile
of
a
good
pils
what
a
shame
this
is
a
drinker
not
a
thinker
give
me
this
beer
and
a
cold
cut
sandwich
and
im
good
to
go
about
medium
in
body
moderately
low
carbonation
very
fitting
for
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
tasty
enough
for
me
to
really
care
i
dont
see
the
need
to
drink
the
one
again
this
was
purchased
at
the
tap
room
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixpack
pours
a
faintly
cloudy
goldenstaw
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
intricate
lacing
aroma
is
citric
and
grassy
flavor
is
pleasantly
bitter
with
a
rich
malt
backbone
perhaps
a
little
bready
and
some
spicy
hops
medium
bodied
but
wonderfly
full
for
the
style
with
moderate
carbonation
a
very
nice
pilsner
that
i
intend
to
drink
regularly
simply
a
lovely
underrated
pilsener
aroma
is
crisp
grassy
hops
and
a
mix
of
toffee
and
caramel
first
sip
is
thin
yet
not
watery
with
gentle
rolling
carbonation
some
lager
malt
up
front
then
a
sharp
bitey
hop
finish
dries
my
mouth
a
little
making
me
thirsty
for
more
a
very
nice
brew
that
is
extremely
drinkable
for
a
hot
summer
day
poured
a
boisterous
and
billowing
clear
yellow
in
color
white
sticky
head
is
all
over
the
place
and
makes
a
nice
patchwork
quilt
on
the
glass
aromas
are
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
slight
scents
of
hoppyness
flavor
was
really
different
i
swear
i
taste
asparagus
yep
asparagus
not
something
one
looks
for
in
a
beer
malty
sweet
after
the
asparagus
goes
away
finishes
with
a
snappy
briskness
that
dries
out
the
palate
nothing
too
spectacular
with
this
one
slightly
cloudy
gold
hue
thin
head
but
sheets
of
lacing
throughout
the
glass
and
noticeable
the
next
morning
holding
tightly
to
the
glass
a
nice
aroma
of
hops
as
well
as
some
fresh
fruit
on
the
nose
crisp
noble
hops
noted
up
front
very
smooth
quite
clean
and
ohsorefreshing
the
hops
dominated
palate
is
coupled
with
a
decent
malty
backbone
some
fresh
fruit
also
noticeable
on
the
palate
just
a
bit
dry
and
at
the
same
time
some
bitterness
the
ideal
session
anytime
anyplace
brew
a
superior
pils
this
beer
had
a
medium
sized
white
head
when
it
was
poured
with
finelarge
sized
bubbles
that
was
mostly
diminishing
the
body
was
clear
with
a
golden
hue
the
nose
was
moderately
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
moderate
bitter
flavor
that
left
a
lingering
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
smooth
watery
and
medium
bodied
this
beer
had
good
lacing
a
light
nose
gives
a
small
hop
sense
and
portrays
the
nice
malt
base
the
hops
are
very
mild
in
the
flavor
taking
a
back
seat
to
the
malt
this
very
drinkable
pilsener
with
a
nice
medium
body
a
delightfully
crisp
finish
another
good
one
from
schlafly
brewed
and
bottled
in
st
louis
at
the
new
facility
much
better
than
the
contract
ones
pours
a
goldenstraw
color
nice
fizzy
foamy
white
head
that
sticks
to
my
glass
light
grainygrassy
flowery
aroma
grainy
and
mild
sweetness
turns
to
a
hoppy
and
bitter
yet
smooth
dryness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
carbonated
mouthfeel
very
clean
and
crisp
this
is
a
very
good
pils
drinkability
good
stuff
pilsners
are
probably
my
least
favorite
style
but
here
is
one
that
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
it
lacks
that
sharp
saaz
hops
bite
many
pure
pilsner
enthusiasts
would
enjoy
but
it
has
a
real
good
drinkability
and
a
nice
maltiness
for
a
pilsner
it
is
relatively
clear
light
golden
in
color
nose
is
grassy
amd
semi
sweet
taste
is
definitely
pretty
sweet
for
a
pilsner
i
like
it
but
others
may
not
if
you
are
after
a
textbook
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
about
right
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
i
rate
the
drinkability
high
because
i
think
this
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
beer
bottom
line
is
this
100
true
to
style
probably
not
its
really
more
of
a
high
quality
american
lager
and
at
that
it
is
very
good
these
are
hard
for
me
to
rate
because
for
the
stye
it
may
not
be
real
good
but
some
american
pilsners
blend
into
the
lager
category
rather
easily
im
putting
these
numbers
down
for
an
american
lager
which
i
feel
it
best
fits
and
in
that
category
it
is
really
outstanding
a
great
every
day
beer
as
a
pilsner
i
would
go

the
pilsner
poured
to
give
an
unassuming
yet
pleasant
golden
colored
beverage
with
a
very
good
creamy
head
that
was
very
long
lasting
and
left
a
lot
of
lace
the
aroma
was
strong
and
fragrant
of
hops
the
taste
was
dominated
by
floral
bitterness
of
hops
and
was
surprisingly
good
the
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasant
and
smooth
and
i
found
this
pilsner
very
drinkable
the
quality
of
this
pilsner
among
a
sea
of
ales
surprised
me
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
color
little
head
and
lace
muted
aroma
of
pale
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
tastes
very
malty
with
a
good
dose
of
noble
hops
in
the
taste
providing
a
hefty
hop
bite
in
the
finish
a
full
bodied
pilsener
with
heavy
amounts
of
malt
and
bitter
hops
seems
a
bit
heavyhanded
as
i
prefer
my
pilseners
more
aromatic
and
refreshing
certainly
better
renditions
of
the
style
to
try
out
there
light
golden
color
with
a
good
thick
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
a
sharp
bitter
hint
the
fruit
character
carries
through
into
the
flavor
and
contrasts
an
aggressive
bitterness
that
finishes
the
brew
off
in
general
i
am
amazed
that
folks
statesside
feel
that
our
attempts
at
this
style
are
better
than
ones
made
in
bohemia
moravia
or
across
germany
but
this
one
is
actually
worth
it
a
truly
satisfying
and
complex
masterpiece
by
one
of
the
ten
to
fifteen
best
breweries
in
the
u
s
for
those
of
us
lucky
enough
to
have
lived
in
wisconsin
this
beer
made
other
attempts
at
this
style
seem
foolish
unrelated
to
the
rating
if
you
leave
one
of
these
in
the
fridge
for
1824
months
it
develops
some
really
nice
barleywine
notes
a
very
nice
lager
from
new
glarus
as
usual
but
for
a
czech
pilsner
i
prefer
a
stronger
saaz
presence
color
is
golden
and
beer
is
nearly
clear
produces
a
thick
white
head
that
persists
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
very
subtle
tastes
delicious
just
a
very
nice
lager
malt
flavor
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
othis
beer
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
still
not
a
pils
fan
but
this
beer
was
decent
dough
and
bread
aromas
with
something
vegetal
thats
tough
to
detect
maybe
light
hop
aromas
very
clean
straw
light
orange
color
with
loose
chains
of
bubbles
pours
a
rocky
head
that
dissipates
quickly
light
sweet
body
with
a
very
mellow
bitterness
sweetness
and
caramel
malt
flavors
quickly
transition
to
a
tart
citruslike
finish
malt
and
tartness
are
more
prevalent
than
hop
flavor
really
enjoyed
that
aspect
of
this
beer
overall
not
much
hop
presence
to
this
one
and
the
bready
malts
are
a
bit
lacking
in
boldness
but
even
though
its
not
the
greatest
pilsner
in
the
world
its
still
worth
a
try
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
medium
levels
of
carbonation
leading
to
a
lightly
foamy
smooth
mouthfeel
thats
appropriate
for
this
beer
though
perhaps
a
bit
low
in
carbonation
for
the
style
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
clining
to
the
palate
o
its
been
a
very
long
time
since
a
pilsner
has
caught
my
attention
but
this
is
simply
fantastic
incredibly
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
i
would
have
a
case
of
this
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
if
new
glarus
made
it
yearround
a
refreshing
take
on
a
style
that
i
usually
consider
bland
c
o
this
beer
is
not
real
crisp
but
is
pretty
clean
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
not
enough
character
to
make
it
sessionable
overall
a
true
pils
and
quite
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
o
ive
been
diving
in
to
the
germanczech
pilsnerslagers
latley
and
with
ng
redily
available
in
wi
what
a
high
bar
to
set
ive
had
examples
from
germany
that
have
been
sitting
on
a
shelf
but
dont
quite
stack
up
this
is
a
winner
all
the
way
still
an
enjoyable
beer
that
would
hold
its
own
against
the
vast
majority
of
americanbrewed
czech
style
pilseners
cheers
great
clean
drinking
pilsner
very
nice
but
what
i
really
want
is
more
hometown
blonde
o
this
is
the
first
beer
that
new
glarus
released
in
nov
1993
and
it
still
is
one
of
the
better
pilsners
brewed
in
the
us
truly
a
timeless
classic
though
this
is
an
overlooked
style
a
wellbalanced
pilsener
is
tough
to
find
i
woud
recommend
this
to
be
among
the
best
the
beer
was
a
golden
yellow
color
when
poured
into
a
glass
the
aroma
was
a
biscuity
beer
aroma
that
is
what
your
grandfathers
beer
smelled
like
but
better
on
the
initial
taste
one
detects
smooth
grassy
notes
with
a
mild
creaminess
mild
notes
of
lemon
are
hidden
in
the
background
the
carbonation
is
wellbalance
and
not
overly
aggressive
the
earthy
grass
of
the
aftertaste
lingers
in
the
mouth
for
an
appropriate
duration
before
it
is
swept
away
by
the
carbonation
edelpils
is
a
nice
smooth
easy
drinker
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
new
glarus
really
has
their
act
together
on
this
one
per
usual
d
overall
this
is
a
really
well
crafted
pilsener
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
than
i
did
because
they
really
nail
the
style
also
its
summer
time
and
pilseners
are
the
epitome
of
summer
beers
to
me
a
really
nice
summer
beer
easy
drinking
and
tasty
overall
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
good
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
style
and
not
incredibly
complex
but
a
good
drinkable
pils
none
the
less
cheers
overall
another
very
solid
beer
from
new
glarus
a
very
easy
drinker
that
i
could
not
hesitate
to
grab
a
sixer
of
at
any
time
you
get
some
hops
and
nice
yeast
presence
drinkability
delicious
and
true
to
form
it
is
simple
yet
so
incredible
and
wellcrafted
excellent
stuff
o
this
is
a
fantastic
warm
weather
beer
hell
id
drink
it
anytime
i
like
this
just
as
much
as
hometown
blonde
glad
to
recommend
flavor
is
nice
and
the
body
is
also
pleasant
apple
butter
on
white
bread
dry
grassy
noble
hop
pristine
and
smooth
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
easily
drinkable
a
classic
that
i
was
very
happy
to
see
again
not
quite
in
the
upper
echelon
of
ng
lagers
with
hometown
blonde
and
bohemian
lager
but
a
solid
summer
drinker
recommended
overall
a
solid
take
on
the
european
pilsener
style
solid
biscuity
taste
with
some
nice
fruit
hints
overall
dan
and
deb
hear
me
out
bring
back
hometown
blonde
that
beer
was
far
better
far
truer
to
its
style
and
far
more
refreshing
this
is
a
good
effort
but
it
just
cannot
stand
up
to
new
glaruss
own
lofty
standards
its
precursor
or
the
other
great
craft
lagers
out
there
victory
prima
pils
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
and
great
lakes
eliot
ness
pick
it
up
if
you
want
to
convert
a
macro
drinker
to
the
side
of
the
force
but
otherwise
choose
a
different
craft
lager
1520
overall
this
is
another
solid
german
lager
brewed
by
dan
carey
he
always
does
a
such
great
job
with
german
beer
styles
this
is
no
exception
glad
that
they
brought
this
beer
out
of
retirement
i
will
probably
be
revisiting
this
beer
a
few
times
of
the
course
of
the
hot
weather
days
that
are
soon
to
be
here
in
the
midwest
its
in
the
middle
of
the
3
german
pilsners
brewed
by
new
glarus
hometown
blond
is
by
far
the
best
german
pilsner
from
new
glarus
but
edelpils
is
a
better
beer
than
two
woman
lager
overall
light
and
pleasant
not
however
an
exemplar
of
the
style
or
terribly
exciting
not
overbearingly
sweet
but
heavy
in
the
nose
and
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
said
it
might
do
with
some
extra
hopping
overall
a
decent
brew
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
from
the
usually
true
to
style
new
glarus
probably
the
only
six
pack
ill
end
up
buying
of
this
as
the
beer
really
isnt
very
refreshing
as
id
normally
expect
a
pils
to
be
o
overall
this
is
a
great
drinker
and
very
tasty
as
a
fresh
lager
my
only
complaint
to
style
is
that
the
hops
seem
a
little
lacking
this
beer
is
more
helles
than
pils
in
character
yet
a
very
wellmade
helles
and
goes
down
as
good
and
delicious
as
any
fresh
tapped
lager
youd
find
in
bavaria
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
pilsner
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
the
style
but
leave
it
to
new
glarus
to
make
an
expertly
crafted
version
of
a
boring
classic
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
they
do
best
simple
clean
beautifully
constructed
lagers
im
a
sucker
for
these
clean
smooth
malty
lagers
edelpils
is
finally
back
after
a
drought
of
45
years
i
heard
it
was
brought
back
to
celebrate
the
20th
anniversary
of
new
glarus
brewery
because
this
was
one
of
the
original
beers
this
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
frothy
head
the
scent
is
quite
grainy
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
superb
for
a
pilsner
lots
of
rich
flavor
of
grains
malts
and
hops
combine
together
to
make
a
well
balanced
brew
this
beer
will
pair
quite
well
with
most
foods
as
its
very
simple
yet
very
tasty
the
aroma
was
loaded
down
with
cereal
grains
and
a
touch
of
light
fruity
yeast
the
aroma
of
banana
clearly
evident
as
was
a
nice
fresh
grass
like
hoppy
nose
the
flavor
followed
right
along
with
it
being
very
light
in
profile
and
feel
and
very
highly
carbonated
list
grain
flavors
dominated
with
a
nice
earthy
feel
hints
of
banana
and
fresh
grass
running
through
it
as
well
pours
a
straw
color
with
big
two
finger
head
using
a
hard
pour
into
a
pint
glass
clove
yeast
and
a
hint
of
orange
peel
in
the
nose
flavor
a
mild
blend
of
clove
grass
and
traces
of
urine
based
on
style
this
one
fits
it
perfectly
definitely
a
well
crafted
beer
but
not
something
that
excites
me
in
any
way
half
finger
white
head
on

crystal
clear
almost
transparent
golden
body
head
doesnt
last
very
long
resolves
to
a
light

on
the
top
smell

corn
okay
i
thought
i
had
evolved
to
like
even
styles
i
used
to
hate
i
can
drink
a
bud
if
i
have
too
okay
not
a
full
one
but
pilsners
still
dont
do
anything
for
me
even
a
craft
brewed
pils
body
is
nicely
carbonated
mouth
is
light
and
crisp
as
expected
taste
is
barely

very

tongue
is
sucked
dry
of

very
fast
still
not
a

i
look

to
drinking
oh
well
maybe
i
can
finish
this

very
light
yellow

pretty

then
grassy

finishes
very
clean
it
is
very
simple
as
pils
shoud
be
in
my
books
crisp
and
refreshing
very
good
drinker
excellent
pils
thanks
again
chris
d
good
beer
but
forgettable
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
unless
i
was
trying
to
compare
pilseners
or
something
the
main
malt
flavor
just
doesnt
quite
have
the
necessary
freshness
for
my
taste
in
lagers
it
looks
really
good
yet
falls
flat
not
yet
in
the
hot
summer
beer
season
im
sure
this
would
be
good
fresh
especially
with
fresh
cut
grass
and
a
grilled
hot
dog
poured
into
a
clear
stein
its
a
brilliant
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
the
flavor
has
a
light
drybiscuit
malt
backbone
with
a
bite
of
spicy
lemon
hops
for
balance
something
about
the
body
almost
makes
this
beer
juicy
and
seemingly
extra
drinkable
i
could
down
it
by
the
liter
stein
and
i
wish
it
were
summer
not
march
so
i
could
have
my
thirst
properly
quenched
by
this
fine
pilsner
dvery
good
drinking
beer
easily
a
good
session
beer
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
decent
version
of
a
german
pilsener
pretty
wellbalanced
and
easy
to
drink
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
of
the
smoothness
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
pilsners
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
d
it
is
the
middle
of
december
here
in
wisconsin
i
am
on
vacation
and
just
experienced
a
snow
storm
where
a
foot
of
snow
fell
overnight
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
suited
for
summer
its
good
but
i
may
have
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
on
a
90
degree
florida
afternoon
i
would
have
to
say
for
its
smooth
simplicity
that
it
is
a
good
beer
certainly
a
gateway
for
nonbas
to
get
into
craft
beer
as
well
its
as
good
as
any
of
the
german
or
czech
imports
plus
its
fresh
local
for
all
but
traders
and
in
brown
bottles
the
pricing
is
also
shockingly
pretty
low
too
medium
body
very
crisp
mouthfeel
finish
is
long
and
fruity
denough
flavour
to
keep
it
interesting
and
crisp
to
make
it
freshing
this
is
the
perfect
example
of
a
well
done
true
to
style
beer
this
would
be
on
hand
for
being
my
offering
to
the
bmc
crowd
if
i
lived
in
wi
i
really
like
when
breweries
make
germanczech
pilsners
and
dont
dumb
them
down
done
right
they
are
truly
wonderful
beers
and
this
one
proves
that
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
am
not
a
pilsnerguy
appearance
is
pretty
good
nice
head
but
no
real
lacing
smell
is
decent
but
a
bit
weak
a
little
malt
and
some
noble
hops
nothing
really
sweet
taste
is
imilar
but
much
more
pronounced
mouthfeel
is
on
par
with
what
it
should
be
drinkability
is
near
perfect
d
easily
drinkable
a
bit
to
simple
but
would
definitely
drink
again
especially
in
the
summer
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
decent
example
of
a
pils
that
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
character
and
or
a
touch
more
hop
notes
still
this
is
good
and
certainly
hit
my
hankering
for
a
pils
though
the
dms
gets
a
bit
distracting
as
i
get
towards
the
end
of
my
glass
this
beer
pour
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
with
a
lot
of
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
noble
hops
the
taste
is
maltier
that
the
aroma
without
much
hop
character
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
pilsenser
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
i
found
it
to
be
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
drinkability
i
picked
this
up
last
week
in
columbus
at
once
upon
a
vine
it
was
a
single
bottle
in
the
fridge
and
not
expecting
to
see
new
glarus
so
far
south
i
should
have
asked
questions
about
its
provenance
perhaps
it
is
a
bit
old
as
it
is
surely
rather
disappointing
compared
to
what
i
expected
from
other
reviews
pours
a
nice
clean
golden
pilsner
with
a
white
head
that
actually
retains
quite
well
grassy
nose
with
grain
and
slight
straw
taste
follows
very
lagery
graininess
some
hay
and
a
tiny
bit
of
pepper
a
slight
cream
wierd
i
know
but
its
there
not
obvious
and
works
well
with
it
though
a
good
mouthfeel
that
is
just
a
touch
too
thick
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
defenite
good
choice
for
a
lawn
mower
refresher
overall
a
solid
pils
from
ng
as
always
i
am
satisified
with
their
product
this
beer
didnt
blow
me
away
as
anything
super
special
but
it
is
a
good
summer
brew
in
new
glarus
already
packed
line
of
good
summer
drinks
it
washed
down
last
nights
bbq
quite
nicely
side
note
i
poured
half
of
my
second
bottle
into
my
chicken
marinade
and
it
ended
up
being
one
of
the
best
chicken
breast
marinades
ive
ever
done
pours
a
great
clear
straw
yellow
with
soe
goo
bubbling
starts
with
a
one
finger
head
that
recedes
to
a
island
film
of
foam
and
a
thin
ring
the
aroma
is
a
clean
hoppy
grass
with
some
brisk
baking
flour
the
taste
starts
with
a
water
cracker
malt
then
mixing
with
some
brisk
herbally
hops
you
can
catch
a
little
citrus
zest
at
the
finish
crisp
and
floury
a
great
pilsner
d
very
easy
to
drink
mouth
feel
was
light
and
refreshing
with
a
good
amount
of
tingle
from
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
certainly
a
good
choice
for
a
session
brew
luxuriant
mouthfeel
the
malt
just
fills
each
nook
and
cranny
carbonation
is
fine
and
prickly
just
enough
to
scrape
the
weight
of
the
malt
off
the
tongue
before
the
next
sip
and
this
is
a
beer
to
sip
and
savor
drinkability
is
off
the
chart
for
me
ill
drink
it
all
a
little
crazy
do
get
it
if
you
can
though
this
is
the
next
step
up
from
the
naked
its
a
bright
golden
with
a
healthy
amount
of
head
at
first
you
get
a
clean
biscuit
like
malt
profile
that
evolves
to
be
a
bit
sweet
there
is
a
good
amount
of
hops
to
keep
it
simple
balanced
and
crisp
refreshing
try
to
enjoy
it
with
the
carr
valley
malenge
cheese
if
your
not
aware
its
north
of
madison
wi
the
cheese
is
a
blend
of
cow
goat
and

its
creamy
with
a
tart
finnish
try
it
a
very
drinkable
and

goes
down
quite
nicely
on
this

this
beer
was
made
for
quaffing
on

and
fits
the
bill
quite
nicely
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
pilsners

may
also
serve
as

round

very

nothing
especially
stands
out
it
is
clean

easy

otherwise
i

the

not

overall
tasty

does
not
come
close
to
a
true
czech
pilsner
but
definitely
drinkable
this
is
an
extremely

is

final
thoughts
all
the
beers
ive
tried
from
king
have
been
excellent
and
while
this
is
probably
the
weakest
link
its
still
one
of
the
best
pilsners
in
canada
if
they
fix
the
carbonation
and
id
say
it
is
probably
the
best
i
honestly
feel
bad
that
king
doesnt
appear
as
successful
or
widely
distributed
then
it
currently
is
this
one
steps
up
to
the
plate
where
it
really
matters
and
i
could
drink
this
all
day
as
a
stand
alone
drinker
or
with

food

of

an
excellent
a
king
brewerys
pilsner
is
a
solid
pale
lager
and
easily
one
of
the
best
locallymade
pilseners
available
in
ontario
the
robust
malt
flavours
are
balanced
nicely
by
the
impressive
noble
hop
bill
and
the
end
result
is
a
deliciously
drinkable
brew
that
is
guaranteed
to
appeal
to
any
fan
of
imported
euro
pilseners
this
brewery
seems
to
focus
mostly
on
brewing
germanstyle
lagers
a
job
they
do
damn
well
i
might
add
but
this
czechstyle
pilsner
is
probably
my
favourite
of
their
three
flagship
yearround
offerings
ill
definitely
be
trying
this
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
and
would
encourage
all
pale
lager
enthusiasts
to
consider
this
one
well
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
this
pilsner
has
a
great
flavour
with
an
appealing
aroma
the
crispness
of
it
makes
it
a
great
beer
to
have
when
needing
something
to
cut
through
cheese
or
strong
flavours
overall
an
excellent
postmowing

of

right
notes
for
the
style
not
overly
hoppy
but
rather
enough
complexity
to
take
beyond
the
craft
take
on
macro
lager
that
dominates
bc
better
than
steamwhistle
and
one
day
hopefully
available
in
bc
by
itself
not
a
bad
effort
at
all
and
one
of
the
better
ontariobrewed
pilsners
ive
had
very
nice
as
an
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
beer
but
lost
something
when
i
tried
it
with
a
couple
meals
was
interested
in
trying
this
as
it
has
some
interesting
reviews
and
its
average
score
places
it
near
the
top
of
the
pilsener
style
but
im
here
to
knock
it
down
a
bit
cause
i
just
dont
see
it
simple
appearance
generally
what
i
would
expect
from
a
macro
smell
is
pretty
muted
sweet
bready
malts
but
not
too
much
coming
through
flavour
is
subtle
with
that
same
malt
character
and
a
light
citrusy
saaz
like
hop
character
refreshing
in
a
simple
way
light
weight
feel
on
the
palate
overall
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
if
it
were
a
macro
id
give
it
top
scores
in
that
vein
overall
this
one
ranks
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
of
them
although
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
bit
more
on
the
taste
aspect
its
very
much
dominated
by
the
bready
malts
and
not
much
of
the
other
smells
that
you
get
really
come
through
on
the
palate
happy
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
because
without
the
ocb
6pack
i
probably
would
have
overlooked
this
one
and
not
even
given
it
a
try
but
i
could
definitely
see
myself
enjoying
this
one
this
summer
while
relaxing
on
the
patio
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
for
an
ontario
beer
it
has
a
great
pils
taste
that
rivals
some
of
its
european
counterparts
id
buy
this
beer
again
and
it
will
be
perfect
for
the
warmer
weather
this
is
a
terrific
czech
pilsner
among
the
best
ive
seen
in
north
america
full
of
flavor
and
a
delight
to
drink
shame
that
this
beer
isnt
more
readily
available
outside
of
the
toronto
area
shame
doh
pretty
drinkable
i
will
def
be
buying
this
again
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
color
almost
golden
nice
white
foamy
head
the
head
is
similar
to
a
cloud
the
aromas
intensity
is
medium
cereal
and
malts
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
nice
bitter
finnish
a
little
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
feels
almost
like
water
very
refreshing
and
well
balanced
quite
easy
to
drink
too
a
nice
beer
on
its
own
i
like
it
cheers
liam
a
great
brew
ive
never
knew
existed
and
from
my
own
backyard
thanks
liamt07
for
this
one
its
a
winner
king
pilsner
could
better
distinguish
itself
from
other
mediocre
mainstream
lagers
on
the
market
by
boasting
about
its
specially
imported
czech
ingredients
namely
the
hops
less
on
its
packaging
and
more
in
its
beer
on
its
own
this
stands
fine
but
in
comparison
with
authentic
czech
examples
and
many
american
renditions
this
falls
a
little
short
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
very
clean
and
flavorful
i
love
me
a
good
pilsner
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
out
there
try
this
beer
seriously
overall
a
great
czech
pilsner
it
sticks
to
tradition
but
really
emphasizes
and
pronounces
each
characteristic
while
managing
to
keep
itself
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
this
leaves
me
excited
to
try
more
of
their
offerings
thumbs
up
another
solid
brew
from
ontario
d
the
standard
by
which
other
ontario
pilsners
are
evaluated
but
i
personally
prefer
more
hops
having
said
that
kings
version
is
an
accurate
and
respectable
take
on
the
style
and
ill
happily
buy
this
whenever
im
looking
for
a
tasty
quaffable
lager
pours
a
strawyellow
colour
with
white
head
the
head
did
quickly
dissipate
with
a
very
small
amount
of
lacing
smells
strongly
of
grassy
saaz
hops
taste
is
quite
saaz
forward
with
some
bready
malts
very
smooth
this
is
one
of
the
best
ontario
pilsners
and
im
glad
i
always
have
access
to
it
pours
yellow
and
light
golden
colour
soapy
white
head
rises
and
falls
leaving
an
etched
surface
solid
ring
some
slippery
lace
medium
carbonation
bubbles
a
bit
larger
than
i
prefer
grassy
skunky
smell
rings
true
to
the
czech
style
hoppy
taste
is
sharp
and
crisp
nice
bitterness
dry
with
huge
malt
aftertaste
that
lingers
light
to
medium
body
ive
heard
some
say
this
might
be
the
best
ontario
brewed
pilsner
and
i
think
you
could
make
an
argument
that
its
among
them
classic
pilsner
nicely
done
id
drink
this
anytime
i
guess
czechstyle
is
appropriate
as
it
does
have
a
number
of
the
required
attributes
to
justly
call
itself
such
but
there
was
just
a
little
too
much
skunk
which
cant
be
blamed
on
overseas
bottle
shipmentslight
struckedness
in
this
case
libation
what
can
i
say
its
a
very
good
pilsner
in
all
respects
the
expected
pils
bitterness
is
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
the
flavor
is
forward
but
doesnt
overwhelm
ill
try
to
drink
a
few
of
these
each
time
im
in
ontario
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
pours
clear
light
yellow
with
white
head
smell
malts
spices
floral
hops
nice
clean
smell
very
good
taste
bitter
at
first

extra
hopped
pilsner
light
yellow
with
some
hop
scent
not
characteristic
hops
come
through
on
an
average
mouthfeel
saaz
hop
presence
worth
trying
but
i
like
the
regular
pilsner
please
quaffable
hops
is
the
taste
including
the
saaz
and
thats
about
it
overall
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
example
of
a
czech
pilsner
in
ontario
you
can
tell
that
there
is
a
dedicated
brewmaster
behind
this
king
describe
their
beer
as
superpremium
which
is
a
heavy
tag
to
wear
but
they
do
it
well
the
brewers
have
managed
to
create
a
really
authentic
czech
pilsner
over
4000
miles
away
from
pilsen
the
dedication
of
importing
the
correct
malt
hops
and
yeast
from
the
czech
republic
allow
this
beer
to
stand
proud
beside
other
great
brews
a
very
drinkable
pils
of
all
the
ones
i
have
had
so
far
my
favourites
come
from
montreal
and
nobleton
on
its
a
strange
world
md
light
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
surprisingly
is
quite
smooth
if
drank
ice
cold
as
it
warms
the
hops
bring
in
an
agressive
bitterness
that
is
not
unpleasant
especially
if
you
like
bitter
beers
overall
id
say
this
is
a
very
good
attempt
at
the
style
that
said
its
certainly
worth
a
try
and
my
mixedfeelings
are
perhaps
more
reflective
of
how
i
feel
about
pilsners
in
general
than
about
king
pilsner
in
particular
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
however
i
grade
it
and
worth
a
try
taste
is
a
bit
nutty
with
a
spicy
pepperiness
in
the
front
light
malt
sweetness
applelike
lots
of
grassy
and
floral
notes
and
a
very
forward
bitterness
that
leaves
you
craving
the
next
sip
aftertaste
is
full
of
the
spicy
and
floral
saaz
flavour
that
i
certainly
crave
from
time
to
time
this
is
a
wellbalanced
pilsner
very
enjoyable
and
has
a
lot
of
flavour
going
on
mouthfeel
is
nice
an
soft
but
finishes
good
and
dry
thanks
to
the
generous
hop
profile
carbonation
is
mild
and
undistracting
a
solid
pilsner
one
im
thankful
to
have
had
and
one
ill
seek
out
on
tap
when
im
in
southern
ontario
again
this
was
an
unfiltered
sample
ontap
at
volo
in
toronto
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
the
standard
offering
but
the
hop
character
is
much
stronger
and
its
slightly
hazy
the
aroma
is
very
floral
with
plenty
of
saaz
hop
goodness
and
the
contribution
of
hops
to
the
flavour
is
much
stronger
overall
i
enjoyed
this
version
more
than
the
regular
version
just
a
little
more
punchy
with
the
hops
and
really
nice
balance
id
drink
this
anytime
d
quite
good
summer
thirst
quencher
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
wonderful
frothy
white
head
fed
by
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
a
rather
pretty
looking
beer
a
nice
grassy
hop
aroma
with
the
czech
hops
peeking
through
very
nice
grassy
and
moderately
spicy
hop
bite
upfront
followed
by
a
doughy
malt
backing
nice
mouthfeel
not
too
watery
a
very
solid
pilsner
a
nice
solid
pilsner
perfect
for
a
hot
southern
ontario
summer
day
on
tap
at
volo
pours
a
clear
light
golden
colour
with
a
small
head
and
little
lace
smells
like
sweet
malts
little
hop
presence
but
the
taste
is
pretty
good
malt
presence
and
pretty
decent
floral
and
bitter
hoppiness
for
a
pilsner
hops
arent
magnificent
but
good
for
an
ontario
pilsner
pretty
good
mouthfeel
creamy
and
smooth
good
carbonation
and
pretty
good
pilsner
still
probably
the
only
ontario
pilsner
that
approaches
authentic
plzen
taste
profile
i
find
that
pilsners
can
be
very
hitandmiss
but
this
one
is
definitely
a
hit
easily
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
tried
this
beer
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
tightly
packed
ivory
head
that
quckly
dissipates
to
form
a
foamy
ring
lots
chunky
patches
of
lace
are
left
on
the
glass
the
carbonation
is
quite
active
and
the
bubble
are
like
pin
pricks
a
good
sign
i
hear
the
aroma
is
of
grassy
saaz
hops
a
grainyness
and
crackers
the
taste
is
quite
a
lot
hoppier
that
urquell
or
bitburger
pine
eucalyptus
and
saaz
sea
air
hop
flavors
are
very
prominent
the
malt
background
is
very
grainy
with
huskyness
the
hops
impart
a
fantastic
bitterness
that
coats
the
mouth
the
finish
is
very
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
bodied
light
carbonation
seems
to
accentuate
the
hoppiness
this
is
one
kick
ass
pilsner
thats
full
of
raw
hop
flavors
my
new
favorite
of
the
style
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
i
probably
will
as
i
have
three
more
taste
is
a
wallop
of
bitter
that
washes
back
into
a
nice
finish
with
an
aftertaste
of
bitter
that
lingers
just
long
enough
its
nice
to
have
a
fresh
pilsner
so
often
the
imports
are
a
gamblewill
they
or
wont
they
be
skunked
so
a
lovely
brew
that
i
think
ill
be
enjoying
as
long
as
im
in
ontario
drinkability
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
reminds
me
of
mill
st
organic
lager
although
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
that
one
still
for
a
real
pilsner
have
an
urquell
czechvar
or
kozel
now
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
from
a
bottle
both
good
quaffs
and
have
seen
these
folks
at
a
couple
of
oktoberfests
and
such
just
a
quick
note
to
acknowledge
the
good
table
they
lay
out
when
theyre
on
the
road
they
dressed
it
up
with
hop
vines
barley
beer
books
beer
wear
and
glasses
interesting
and
wellpresented
and
an
indication
of
their
enthusiasm
i
would
imagine
all
that
and
a
decent
beer
too
looking
forward
to
visiting
their
brewery
overall
an
interesting
brew
this
is
not
a
bad
spin
of
the
pilsner
style
would
do
again
slightly
sweeter
and
more
lemony
than
expected
from
a
pilsner
not
great
a
little
bitterno
floral
hints
not
a
fan
of
the
pear
with
the
pilsen
malt
on
my
tongue
it
gives
an
off
taste
when
combined
f
light
slightly
metallic
like
all
delaware
beers
must
be
the
refineries
theres
a
solid
pilsner
behind
the
tart
pear
flavor
but
the
pear
really
dragged
the
whole
thing
down
the
peach
was
overbearing
instead
of
accentuating
cloying
and
artificial
tasting
poured
into
pilsner
glass
finger
of
head
very
light
clear
yellow
smell
is
sharp
a
little
pear
and
hops
and
yeast
high
carbonation
maybe
too
much
very
harsh
and
bubbly
going
down
tart
bitter
pear
i
did
not
like
the
tartness
and
was
too
much
carbonation
made
my
stomach
and
chest
feel
bloated
and
bubbly
tart
and
bitter
pils
a
lot
different
from
everything
else
ive
had
from
dogfish
head
di
loves
this
beer
gave
it
at
4
75
clear
and
golden
yellow
lighter
carbonation
and
heavier
body
than
other
pils
ive
tried
which
is
interesting
enjoyable
pils
solid
american
representation
of
the
style
this
was
really
good
tart
and
pear
like
the
hops
were
really
good
there
was
an
interesting
soapy
taste
to
it
but
that
wasnt
the
turn
off
that
it
would
sound
like
it
would
be
honey
color
with
a
medium
white
head
malt
and
yeast
aromas
taste
of
malt
with
a
biscuit
aftertaste
nice
clean
finish
with
mild
carbonation
overall
a
nice
pilsner
i
expected
more
pear
flavor
in
this
one
i
think
the
caramel
undertones
overpowered
the
pear
nice
color
aroma
ill
give
this
one
another
try
to
win
me
over
deep
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
foamy
head
that
hangs
on
and
leaves
sheets
of
lacing
all
over
the
glass
aromas
are
very
adjunct
like
to
me
grassy
heavy
dough
aroma
and
some
spicy
hop
character
but
no
fruit
notes
come
through
taste
differs
on
that
end
opens
with
grass
hay
and
big
dough
pilsner
quality
mid
palate
brings
fruity
pear
and
apple
notes
and
a
spicy
lemony
finish
well
carbonated
but
creamy
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
an
interesting
change
of
pace
the
flavor
delivers
and
i
do
like
it
as
a
change
from
big
winter
beers
id
probably
revisit
this
one
again
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
it
was
probably
the
pear
that
made
it
so
bad
it
presented
to
me
as
something
gone
wrong
it
looked
beautiful
but
smelled
and
tasted
bad
decent
retention
and
lace
fruity
and
caramelly
scent
bittering
hops
shine
through
with
fruity
tones
deep
caramel
undertones
with
a
dry
finish
somewhat
drinkable
even
with
the
abv
to
be
transparent
had
to
look
up
what
a
czech
style
pilsner
was
this
was
my
first
this
one
holds
true
to
definition
golden
high
foaminess
lighter
flavor
i
was
a
little
worried
about
the
pear
flavor
but
the
pear
is
subtle
slightly
tart
but
virtually
no
aftertaste
very
smooth
good
but
not
overly
flavored
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
version
of
a
pils
and
i
find
it
a
bit
spiky
so
the
name
fits
i
wonder
if
more
pear
flavor
or
nose
would
tip
this
into
fruit
beer
territory
but
as
it
stands
the
pear
is
backgrounded
by
the
punchy
hops
very
good
beer
cant
wait
to
have
one
in
the
spring
and
summer
i
didnt
find
this
piercing

nonetheless
theres
a
marked
difference
between
the
warm
and
cool
variations
that
i
tried
at
cooler
temps
it
was
much
more
refreshing
and
masked
some
of
the
imperfections
the
warmer
variety
had
me
focused
on
all
of
the

things
the

can
be
said
for

which
i
guess
from
the
color
o
glad
to
see
dfh
putting
out
a
lager
especially
a
quirky
pilsner
like
this
one
it
is
a
great
one
for
house
parties
and
seems
to
fit
right
in
this
would
seem
to
be
a
great
beer
to
get
people
off
macros
since
it
is
a
lager
and
by
dfh
however
it
is
a
seasonal
o
i
expected
a
pear
pilsener
instead
i
got
a
beer
that
is
not
quite
fruity
nor
a
typical
pilsener
reminded
me
a
little
of
some
of
dfhs
winebeer
work
i
was
ready
either
for
a
crisp
tight
brilliant
pilsener
or
a
fruitified
pilsener
well
maybe
thats
what
this
is
seems
dfh
toned
down
the
pear
flavors
so
as
to
avoid
creating
a
toosweet
pilsener
because
it
wasnt
too
sweet
which
would
have
been
a
critical
flaw
but
it
did
take
on
a
white
winelike
sweetness
over
time
as
it
warmed
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
less
wellrounded
as
if
thats
a
flaw
and
something
a
little
with
a
little
more
bite
or
zing
an
interestingatypical
profile
for
the
style
i
think
that
fans
of
dfhs
winehybrid
beers
would
like
this
but
some
hardcore
pilsener
fans
might
not
find
it
crisp
enough
i
wont
return
to
it
but
i
definitely
recommend
it
they
should
definitely
put
this
beer
in
6
packs
and
make
it
year
round
as
one
of
their
lighter
easier
drinking
beers
to
turn
even
more
people
on
to
better
beer
as
for
pilsners
its
one
of
the
better
domestic
made
ones
but
surprisingly
pretty
basic
tasting
if
strangely
muted
for
all
the
crazy
sensations
i
would
expect
from
a
dogfish
beer
how
about
that
an
exotic
df
beer
with
obscure
ingredients
that
just
comes
out
about
normal
who
knew
but
there
you
have
it
but
i
prefer
a
traditional
pils
than
this
but
this
is
a
good
offering
overall
as
usual
an
interesting
take
from
dfh
glad
i
tried
it
probably
wont
be
a
staple
i
give
dfh
somewhere
between
a
c
and
a
b
for
their
efforts
lets
call
it
an
80
this
definitely
has
that
signature
dfh
taste
to
it
it
doesnt
come
off
as
a
gimmick
they
seem
to
stay
true
to
the
style
enjoyable
stuff
recommended
overall
very
unique
and
enjoyable
refreshing
and
light
piercing
pils
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
the
4th
of
july
as
a
seasonal
theyre
about
a
half
calendar
off
in
order
to
suit
the
winter
season
betterthe
brewers
should
strive
for
a
spiced
pear
character
not
just
banal
pears
dogfish

pils
3

o
this
is
great
set
out
to
do
exactly
what
they
wanted
great
pilsener
with
a
pear
taste
in
the
background
dfh
special
releases
and
seasonals
scare
me
but
this
was
a
hit
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
fluffy
large
white
head
with
high
retention
on
a
bright
golden
body
aroma
includes
classic
pilsner
malt
profile
with
a
touch
of
fresh
fruity
sweetness
of
course
pearlike
taste
is
crisp
mild
hop
bite
subtle
malt
sweetness
and
subtle
pear
sweetness
no
alcohol
tasted
very
refreshing
interesting
and
tasty
odd
to
release
this
summery
beer
in
the
winter
but
delicious
kickass
approach
to
a
czech
pils
another
great
release
that
i
hope
gets
brewed
again
m
light
medium
body
call
me
a
convert
this
isnt
great
beer
but
it
sure
as
hell
is
very
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
somewhat
like
a
hybrid
of
beer
mixed
with
pear
iced
tea
a
relatively
odd
combination
of
flavors
but
it
kind
of
works
as
it
is
rather
crisp
and
refreshing
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
had
a
cloudy
gold
color
body
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
has
a
lemon
and
malt
smell
the
taste
has
a
citrus
hop
upfront
followed
by
the
malty
bread
then
on
the
finish
the
sweetness
of
the
pear
comes
through
slightly
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
overall
a
good
prisoner
let
it
warm
up
a
little
bit
to
get
some
pear
decent
base
beer
and
the
nuances
are
fairly
subtle
i
like
the
crackery
malt
character
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
tea
notes
this
beer
is
definitely
piercing
on
the
tongue
with
an
assertive
crispness
its
nice
for
a
pils
and
it
doesnt
fall
of
its
also
not
a
cover
for
lack
of
depth
in
the
feel
it
still
has
some
smoothness
and
a
few
layers
to
get
through
in
its
light
to
medium
body
overall
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
the
pilsner
base
is
tasty
the
pear
comes
through
at
the
end
and
as
it
warms
so
that
this
is
different
enough
from
other
pilsners
i
would
buy
this
year
round
as
it
is
one
of
the
better
dfh
beers
i
have
had
in
some
time
dogfish
generally
can
do
no
wrong
until
now
this
pours
a
typical
pilsner
color
with
a
large
head
that
drops
quickly
but
also
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
the
smell
is
typical
pilsner
bread
notes
from
the
malt
as
well
as
hops
along
with
a
citrus
note
the
taste
is
well
a
mess
at
least
in
the
finish
it
starts
off
quite
good
with
crackerbread
flavors
from
the
malt
and
a
good
amount
of
hop
presence
too
but
the
pear
just
doesnt
blend
well
it
seems
to
make
the
beer
taste
fresh
and
it
certainly
is
original
but
the
flavor
doesnt
work
with
anything
here
overall
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
without
the
pear
as
the
simple
pilsner
flavors
seem
to
be
in
place
without
the
fanciness
at
around
10
004
pack
im
glad
i
tried
it
only
because
its
a
dogfish
brew
but
ill
never
look
for
it
again
overall
its
pears
its
pils
its
okay
at
least
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
typical
wintertime
fare
o
nice
unique
take
on
the
pils
that
is
def
worth
a
shot
mellow
gold
body
with
floaty
milky
head
on
top
aroma
of
saaz
light
pear
and
fresh
springtime
bloom
tastes
of
pear
floral
notes
some
more
mouthpuckering
light
fruits
and
vague
honey
sweetness
and
booze
in
the
back
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
looks
great
smells
good
tastes
is
sweet
but
unfulfilling
the
taste
is
more
czechstyle
that
fruitstyle
which
is
good
but
i
personally
miss
the
dryer
bite
i
expect
later
in
the
taste
it
is
replaced
by
what
i
pick
up
a
little
more
clearly
as
pear
which
does
conflict
with
the
bitter
hops
a
bit
to
produce
what
to
me
was
an
offtaste
although
it
was
brief
as
the
fruit
taste
took
over
fairly
quickly
alcohol
its
here
but
i
never
felt
it
and
im
sure
that
if
i
had
all
4
bottles
in
a
sitting
i
would
notice
the
booze
kicking
in
a
bit
while
not
a
session
beer
this
may
as
well
be
since
its
so
easygoing
that
more
than
one
could
be
downed
in
a
sitting
while
not
on
the
level
of
the
victory
prima
pils
this
was
a
great
take
on
the
style
that
doesnt
get
a
lot
of
love
in
colder
months
of
even
when
it
comes
to
ratings
a
mellow
brew
from
dogfish
that
was
unlike
anything
else
in
their
current
lineup
and
worth
a
go
for
someone
looking
for
a
alternative
to
whats
currently
available
this
holiday
season
the
feel
is
very
clean
and
crisp
despite
being
a
medium
bodied
beer
overall
i
think
that
dogfish
has
a
winner
in
this
pilsner
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
recommending
getting
it
if
they
want
something
light
strange
i
dont
usually
like
pears
but
there
is
this
delicious
bright
fresh
pear
taste
but
theres
also
this
hoppy
bright
bitterness
as
well
cant
tell
if
they
go
well
together
though
starts
with
this
delicious
pear
fruity
flavors
light
to
medium
bodied
with
brisk
refreshing
carbonation
leads
to
this
earthy
bitter
citric
rind
hop
flavor
the
flavors
dont
really
blend
together
well
but
they
dont
oppose
eachother
interesting
yet
strange
once
your
tongue
gets
acclimated
to
both
flavors
they
seem
to
come
together
nicely
whats
pulled
apart
at
first
comes
together
half
way
through
refreshing
semisweet
yet
with
a
clean
crisp
bitterness
would
i
call
it
a
czech
pilsner
definitely
not
the
fruitiness
of
this
beer
makes
it
much
different
but
it
does
have
those
qualities
i
like
it
a
unique
take
on
the
style
but
not
to
be
compared
to
others
in
the
style

overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
czech
pilsener
with
a
slight
twist
to
it
that
was
light
enough
to
not
cover
up
the
true
flavors
of
the
style
and
i
thought
that
made
for
some
nice
balance
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
without
getting
bored
with
it
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
besides
the
pear
it
was
a
pretty
by
the
book
czech
pilsener
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
released
this
time
of
the
year
i
think
a
summer
release
would
much
better
suit
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
since
its
fairly
pricey
for
a
czech
pilsener
but
im
sure
i
would
buy
at
least
a
bottle
or
two
if
the
weather
was
warm
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anybody
who
likes
the
style
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
going
into
it
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
dogfish
head
can
be
a
little
unpredictable
sometimes
but
this
turned
out
to
be
a
good
straight
forward
czech
pilserner
with
a
light
pear
aspect
it
might
be
nice
to
have
a
little
more
pear
flavor
but
that
might
cover
up
some
of
those
good
czech
pilsener
flavors
so
i
think
it
was
fine
just
the
way
it
was
good
job
dogfish
head
this
was
a
pretty
solid
and
easy
drinking
beer
keep
up
the
good
work
overall
good
interesting
pils
overall
i
applaud
dogfish
head
for
making
this
pilsner
its
crisp
and
adventurous
and
very
flavorful
releasing
in
the
early
winter
is
fine
and
makes
a
nice
departure
from
the
heavy
beers
of
norm
this
time
of
year
its
very
hoppy
and
6
is
a
little
high
so
its
not
quite
a
summer
lawnmower
beer
id
drink
this
one
any
time
of
year
though
nice
job
o
a
very
nice
version
of
a
style
that
i
am
a
fan
of
and
wish
more
american
breweries
worked
as
hard
to
nail
this
style
as
they
do
stouts
and
ipas
the
pear
gives
it
that
extra
dogfish
head
quality
of
something
different
in
there
that
really
is
not
over
done
would
like
to
catch
this
ontap
some
time
piercing
pils
a
beer
ive
wanted
to
try
since
i
heard
about
the
pear
juice
and
pear
tea
additions
pours
a
brilliant
golden
color
with
bright
fluffy
white
head
ive
been
drinking
dfh
pils
since
the
prescription
pils
golden
shower
golden
era
and
the
latest
my
antonia
i
liked
them
all
by
the
way
nice
to
see
a
6
abv
on
a
pils
from
them
that
has
saaz
hops
backing
it
all
up
aroma
has
an
earthy
herbal
note
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
actual
pears
more
saaz
earthy
citrus
cut
grass
qualities
with
a
nice
bready
malt
back
bone
flavor
has
some
pear
essence
and
more
earthy
herbal
tea
bitterness
too
bad
most
of
the
pear
sweetness
was
fermented
out
here
as
a
whole
its
a
nice
full
bodied
pils
with
easy
drinkability
a
bit
off
centered
but
much
less
so
than
some
of
their
crazy
adjuncts
they
usually
put
out
there
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
sturdy
carbonation
goes
down
great
with
every
sip
overall
no
complaints
noted
here
im
a
fan
of
this
pils
as
well
but
dont
expect
it
to
reinvent
the
wheel
o
a
nice
complex
pilsner
the
pear
both
juice
and
tea
really
adds
a
nice
dimension
to
a
good
pilsner
base
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
quite
quaffable
good
value
at
under
9
for
a
4pack
recommended
if
you
like
a
good
pils
overall
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
the
pear
is
subtle
but
makes
this
beer
interesting
and
doesnt
detract
in
my
opinion
well
picked
combination
of
flavors
that
work
together
for
a
nice
mild
crisp
beer
first
pilsners
are
not
my
go
to
style
so
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
and
the
knowledge
that
it
may
be
more
affected
by
my
other
tastes
than
it
actually
being
true
to
style
first
it
pours
pretty
much
exactly
like
i
would
expect
a
perfect
pilsner
to
absolutely
clear
light
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
and
perpetual
effervescing
bubbles
rising
from
everywhere
smell
was
pretty
standard
a
bit
hoppier
than
most
couldnt
really
pick
out
much
pear
odor
taste
has
some
pear
sweetness
up
front
going
to
some
bread
and
malt
in
the
middle
some
faint
spice
and
notes
of
tea
left
on
the
aftertaste
feel
is
light
with
crisp
carbonation
overall
for
someone
who
doesnt
really
like
pilsners
this
isnt
bad
the
hops
and
pear
and
subtle
sweetness
bring
some
good
complexity
definitely
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
and
consider
it
if
youre
not
overall
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
to
date
remove
the
pear
from
the
equation
and
this
would
be
an
amazing
bohemian
pilsener
the
pear
however
is
another
dfh
unorthodox
win
it
ups
the
alcohol
and
complexity
to
deconstruct
a
classic
while
mostly
holding
true
to
its
roots
pear
taste
is
mild
but
has
a
sweet
essence
up
front
with
a
nice
mix
of
pear
and
pilsner
malt
with
subtle
hops
and
herbal
floral
qualities
adding
dimension
to
the
perry
component
with
mild
fruit
taste
and
tangy
yeast
with
mostly
dry
and
hop
flavored
finish
overall
this
was
an
excellent
hybrid
of
styles
i
am
a
fan
of
pear
and
was
pleased
to
try
this
i
probably
could
have
enjoyed
several
but
there
were
13
other
great
beers
to
try
nice
mellow
sweetness
and
hop

if
you
like

you

some
times

a

with
bold
flavors
had
on
tap
pretty
excellent
balance
of
pumpkin

pumpkin
is
a
light
flavor
and
ginger
can
be

powerful
i
got
the
cap
off
and

interesting

with

this
seems
to
be
well
behind
its

date
so
the
rating
is
a
bit
unfair
though
i
tried
to
compensate
it
a
bit
o
honestly
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
simple
but
well
done
if
youre
looking
for
refreshment
or
drinkability
look
no

o
if
the
big
american

would

half
this
good
i
would
be
much
more

to
drink
them
this
is
what
the

should
be
a

a
pretty
standard
traditional
lager
here
from
the
czech

you
really
cant
beat

a

not
the
most
interesting
beer
but
a

consumed

massive
quantities

its

probably
wouldnt

would

better

i
had
enjoyed
it
during

be
enjoyed
by
even
casual
beer
drinkers

those
classic

its
also
friday
so
people
tend
to
get
off
work
a
bit
earlier
and
wind
down
in
time
for
the
weekend
my
family
a
couple
of
friends
and
myself
decided
to
meet
up
at
babylon
bar
in
the
center
of
town
the
bars
owned
by
a
family
that
operate
a
few
czech
influenced
restaurants
and
bars
so
naturally
i
felt
inclined
to
order
something
czech
off
the
beer
menu
sitting
in
the
sun
in
the
outdoor
section
of
the
place
i
really
wanted
something
mellow
and
easy
and
the
pils
was
therefore
the
perfect
match
a
traditional
and
well
crafted
oldworld
pilsner
from
the
heart
of
the
czech
republic

nice

not

it
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
the
sulfur

taste
just
starts
to
overpower
the
other
flavors
and
character
a
bit
to
much
a
decent
czech
lager
exhibiting
a
more
malty
profile
than
the

the
hops
overshadowed
a
tad
still
nice
and
drinkable
and
very
reminiscent
of
time
spent
on
summer
patios
in
prague
d
very
easy
to
drink
overall
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
beer
it
seems
that
several
other
primator
brews
are
way
better

on

day
its
a
beer
that
you
can
tell
has
had
some
effort
put
into
its
crating
this
beer
has
europe
written
all
over
it
and
is
at
a
great
price

they
had
to
get
it
all
the
way
from
czech
republic
to
california
with
a
price
of
2

not
cold
still
it
is
pretty
average
an
average
pilsner
overall
a
good
pils
this
is
a
good
czech
beer
but
nothing
amazing
its
definitely
a
well
crafted
beer
without
the
skunk
i
was
expecting
and
highly
drinkable
im
sure
this
would
pair
well
with
a
lot
of
different
foods
as
well
glad
i
tried
it
and
considering
the
price
around
299500ml
ill
certainly
look
for
it
again
relatively
smooth
taste
like
a
typical
european
lager
decent
but
in
an
already
crouded
genre
there
are
better
choices
probably
wont
find
it
in
my
fridge
again
very
tasty
and
drinkable
excellent
if
i
were
to
vote
that
competition
that
called
primator
premium
lager
the
best
lager
in
the
world
i
wouldnt
be
one
to
vote
that
way
but
i
will
say
that
primator
is
a
very
competent
czech
lager
czech
it
out
d
as
with
a
lot
of
lager
imports
this
is
probably
not
at
its
best
that
being
said
it
is
a
quite
tasty
lager
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
purchase
d
a
nice
pilsner
that
i
had
not
tried
nor
even
heard
of
until
a
friend
brought
one
round
the
house
glad
he
did
d
a
nice
czech
pilsener
that
ill
have
again
decently
drinkable
but
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
after
the
first
taste
still
better
than
most
of
the
euro
lagers
ive
been
trying
lately
herold
urquell
bb
burgerbrau
still
remain
at
the
top
in
my
mind
for
session
czech
pilsners
can
thanks
to
milos
clear
light
golden
pours
a
thin
white
foam
simple
nose
of
grain
grassy
hops
and
some
pale
malts
is
very
clean
slightly
sweet
grainy
pale
malt
flavour
has
a
good
dose
of
fresh
grassy
hops
and
is
slightly
fruity
slightly
sharp
in
the
finish
with
moderate
bitterness
good
thanks
milos
the
taste
is
similar
clean
clear
but
fullbodied
firm
in
character
complex
balanced
and
engaging
it
has
a
strong
breadherb
character
of
bread
herbs
with
grain
light
lemon
hints
of
yeast
and
grass
firm
sweetness
with
balancing
zesty
bitterness
mostly
herbal
slightly
medicinal
with
just
a
light
spicey
bite
it
has
great
balance
excellent
interplay
of
the
various
elements
and
a
long
complex
aftertaste
of
sweet
lightly
toasted
bread
with
lemonyherbal
bitterness
the
feel
is
excellent
full
slightly
oily
yet
lively
and
engaging
if
becoming
slightly
thin
by
the
end
it
engages
the
whole
mouth
will
drink
again
the
carbonation
is
what
saves
the
day
and
help
bring
forth
the
malts
and
the
hops
of
a
brew
that
would
otherwise
be
a
little
boring
what
a
lovely
lager
this
is
it
pours
a
dark
golden
colour
with
a
rocky
white
head
the
nose
is
full
of
the
classic
czech
saaz
floral
notes
the
beer
itself
was
crisp
i
would
eve
say
it
was
slightly
tart
with
a
nicely
rounded
body
a
very
refreshing
lager
which
could
quite
easily
become
a
regular
in
the
fridge
nice
beer
when
the
weather
is
hot
d
drinkability
is
probably
this
brews
forte
more
heavily
malted
and
fruity
than
most
pilseners
this
is
a
good
definition
of
what
i
consider
perfect
malthop
balance
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
a
fresh
czech
beer
with
the
hops
of
a
pilsner
and
the
maltyness
of
a
lager
carbonation
is
alright
this
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
nice
as
budvar
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
czech
pilsener
style
d
a
delicious
pilsener
from
the
country
who
does
it
best
for
me
this
is
not
session
beer

it
wouldnt
do
it
justice
i
would
savour
this
one
slowly
i
am
a
fan
of
the
tall
can
filled
with
eiro
lager
as
i
find
it
maintains
the
freshness
over
bottles
this
is
a
nice
czech
pils
that
compares
with
urquell
et
al
with
its
hops
bite
and
fresh
finish
big
enough
in
body
to
satisfy
but
smooth
enough
for
summer
drinking
worth
the
purchase
primators
premium
lager
is
a
special
order
beer
in
sweden
it
poured
in
a
nice
golden
color
but
not
with
much
foam
the
taste
is
great
with
apple
and
pear
notes
perfumesmelling
hops
and
citrus
the
taste
did
not
quite
live
up
to
the
expectations
created
by
the
smell
nevertheless
its
a
bitter
bready
taste
with
some
sourness
and
very
typical
for
this
type
of
beer
maybe
too
much
carbonation
though
all
and
all
its
a
good
pilsener
that
tastes
even
better
a
little
overchilled
very
refreshing
the
bootle
was
a
50cl
brown
affair
the
sunday
times
wine
club
sell
them
by
the
cardboard
crate
at
a
very
good
rate
according
to
my
brotherinlaw
he
is
welcome
to
them
a
decent
beer
the
best
from
nachod
brewery
pretty
much
everything
you
look
for
in
a
czech
pilstype
lager
refreshing
bitter
but
not
palate
challenging
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
overall
pretty
tasty
but
i
know
there
are
better
czechs
out
there
for
my
palette
a
good
pick
for
a
czech
pils
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
i
paired
this
with
a
smoke
sheeps
milk
cheesesharp
they
went
very
well
together
pours
a
beautiful
amber
orange
somewhere
tween
ripe
apricot
and
tangerine
inch
thick
head
that
dissipated
quickly
lovely
little
bubbles
that
are
fun
to
watch
aroma
very
typical
for
true
euro
pils
like
standing
outside
a
large
brewery
on
a
windy
spring
day
after
the
rain
flavor
pretty
complex
for
a
pils
a
little
citrusy
buckling
under
the
weight
of
stern
hops
fading
to
the
normal
pleasant
euro
skunkiness
crisp
and
bracing
in
the
mouth
with
those
lovely
little
bubbles
giving
the
exact
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
unlike
some
others
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
update
had
this
one
again
in
2010
and
didnt
like
it
much
better
than
before
theres
just
a
nasty
cornish
aftertaste
to
this
pils
that
frustrates
the
hell
out
of
me
this
is
choice
very
nice
lager
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
white
head
that
is
quite
nice
to
look
at
lacing
is
average
the
smell
is
very
malty
slight
toasted
grain
touch
of
fruit
the
taste
is
maltier
than
most
lagers
rich
but
still
smooth
goes
well
with
meals
the
caramel
grains
are
pleasant
slight
hops
cleanses
the
palate
light
bodied
and
great
session
beer
a
malty
metallic
bohemian
pilsener
pouring
a
slightly
tarnished
brassy
color
with
decent
head
leaving
stagnant
pools
of
foam
and
minimal
lacing
strong
malty
aroma
with
elements
of
bread
crust
cracker
and
vague
boiled
vegetables
the
beer
goes
down
quite
easily
with
a
generous
sweetness
from
the
malts
balanced
by
typical
pilsner
hoppage
heavily
herbal
a
bit
of
grass
and
maybe
even
a
twinge
of
black
licorice
a
large
gulp
reveals
a
sharpness
and
slight
sourness
that
is
most
likely
the
result
of
time
and
travel
hops
taste
slightly
stale
but
i
am
inclined
to
hold
that
against
the
importer
distributor
and
vendor
rather
than
the
brewery
easily
avoided
by
taking
smaller
sips
and
revelling
in
the
malty
qualities
up
front
mouthfeel
thin
and
refreshing
drinkability
decent
if
not
through
the
roof
a
clear
brew
pale
straw
in
color
with
a
yeasty
lagerish
aroma
and
a
scant
white
head
delivers
the
goods
but
not
in
great
quantity
the
flavor
is
dry
and
reserved
the
body
is
thin
the
mouthfeel
ordinary
a
trickle
of
carbonation
rises
upwards
and
some
yeast
sediment
sits
below
this
is
a
pleasant
drinking
beer
but
very
modest
in
scope
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
the
beer
pours
the
archetypal
limpid
golden
yellow
color
with
the
stereotypical
bright
white
and
large
spumous
head
and
as
it
desiccates
the
lace
a
forms
a
fine
covering
upon
the
glass
nose
is
thee
quintessential
lager
nose
malt
that
is
somewhat
sweet
citrus
crisp
and
clean
the
prototypical
lager
start
that
is
nicely
malted
and
lightly
sweet
top
is
fair
to
middling
in
feel
finish
is
almost
astringent
in
its
carbonation
with
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
lingering
in
all
honesty
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
have
sampled
pours
clear
gold
under
a
one
finger
white
head
with
some
body
but
not
much
staying
power
the
nose
features
mild
flowery
hops
the
mouth
is
crisp
light
and
prickly
the
taste
is
almost
all
hops
a
bit
harsh
a
bit
metallic
thanks
to
the
sugar
i
suspect
and
a
bit
flowery
underneath
it
all
theres
also
some
spiciness
here
somewhere
reminiscent
of
coriander
a
very
good
bitter
bite
emerges
in
the
aftertaste
ok
but
a
bit
disappointing
dad
picked
up
a
case
of
this
for
8
pounds
or
something
ridiculous
like
that
with
that
in
mind
this
isnt
bad
slightly
honeyish
with
ssome
floral
hops
fairly
bitter
but
lacking
in
most
departmnets
nothing
distinctive
or
anything
just
a
simple
quaffable
lager
primator
no
not
a
double
bock
rather
it
is
a
hearty
lager
from
the
czech
republic
this
beer
pours
a
fairly
deep
golden
color
the
aroma
is
nice
and
rich
malty
this
is
obviously
not
a
czech
style
pils
it
is
very
malty
much
more
than
is
typical
for
the
style
initial
sweetness
leads
to
a
toasty
middle
and
a
fairly
understated
aftertaste
with
hints
of
toffee
this
is
actually
a
nice
beer
at
any
price
but
at
99
cents
for
a
half
a
liter
it
is
a
steal
this
one
is
brewed
in
accordance
with
the
german
purity
laws
of
the
other
beers
that
i
have
had
that
also
comply
the
green
monsters
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
not
as
generic
as
some
other
european
brews
ive
had
pretty
decent
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
color
with
a
medium
side
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
very
thin
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
very
malty
with
mild
hop
undertones
the
taste
is
primarily
dominated
by
the
malt
and
finished
off
by
a
hint
of
sweetness
there
was
an
astringent
almost
skunky
aftertaste
left
this
beer
is
ok
at
best
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
it
compares
favorable
to
other
czech
pilseners
but
the
malty
sweetness
would
become
a
bit
too
cloying
if
this
was
a
session
beer
this
rich
golden
beer
pours
with
a
thick
snow
white
head
that
ever
so
slowly
fades
to
a
layer
of
white
film
atop
the
very
slightly
hazy
liquid
while
leaving
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
bready
with
pepper
and
lemon
notes
and
a
malt
character
to
it
as
well
the
taste
is
rather
sweet
with
notes
of
lemon
and
pepper
almost
to
a
point
of
sourness
very
unique
the
finish
is
fairly
crisp
with
the
citric
tartness
lingering
behind
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
satisfying
and
supports
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
well
the
drinkability
suffers
a
little
from
the
sweetness
a
little
from
the
tartness
this
beer
almost
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
dortmunder
lager
and
a
weizen
of
some
sort
while
cetainly
not
one
of
my
favorites
im
glad
i
experienced
this
beer
this
brew
pours
a
beautiful
golden
copper
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
too
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
lace
sweet
maltiness
dominates
the
aroma
with
a
slightly
husky
grain
aroma
and
very
faint
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
maltiness
before
the
brief
burst
of
hops
in
the
middle
the
hops
are
then
beaten
out
again
by
the
malt
for
the
finish
of
the
brew
there
is
a
lingering
sweet
maltiness
almost
sticky
along
with
a
strange
metallic
flavor
almost
like
i
was
drinking
this
out
of
a
can
the
brew
has
a
decent
body
to
it
but
the
sticky
sweet
taste
that
is
left
in
your
mouth
drops
it
down
some
as
well
as
bringing
the
drinkability
down
some
there
is
just
too
much
overly
sweet
malt
in
this
beer
and
not
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
clear
golden
hue
w
profuse
threads
of
bubbles
supporting
the
persistant
and
thick
head
dense
and
ornate
lace
is
left
sweet
grainy
malt
in
aroma
w
a
trace
of
cooked
cabbage
the
overall
flavor
profile
is
quite
sweet
due
to
the
meager
hop
bitterness
the
malt
character
lacks
depth
and
consists
ofresidual
sweetness
and
light
breadiness
but
not
much
else
is
there
a
mildly
grassy
hop
flavor
eeks
in
but
is
lost
amongst
the
malt
sweetness
although
moderately
bodied
and
smooth
in
mouthfeel
the
sweetness
and
lack
of
balance
hurts
the
drinkability
finishes
expectedly
sweet
primator
lacks
the
refined
balance
of
a
good
vienna
it
falls
short
of
its
attractive
appearance
czech
beers
referring
mostly
to
its
lack
of
uniqueness
compared
to
others
this
is
not
a
hard
beer
to
drink
ambercaramel
color
with
a
nice
chunky
head
one
of
the
most
malty
lagers
ive
come
across
solid
mouthfeel
full
of
moderately
sweet
carameltoffee
malt
hops
held
back
but
gave
enough
show
to
throw
a
little
balance
in
although
the
overall
effect
was
unbalanced
toward
the
malt
side
nontheless
quite
a
smooth
and
easydrinking
beverage
interesting
to
find
a
beer
with
a
name
ending
in
ator
that
isnt
a
dupplebock
overall
i
did
not
care
for
this
beer
at
all
in
fact
i
havent
found
a
palmetto
product
that
i
am
very
fond
of
there
are
many
lagers
out
there
that
are
better
than
this
including
the
bmcs
pretty
average
lager
not
their
best
beer
but
easy
to
drink
and
better
than
a
bud
light
o
a
wellbuilt
traditional
beer
i
bet
others
will
knock
it
for
not
being
extreme
enough
but
to
me
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
an
american
interpretation
of
an
oldworld
pilsner
o
not
sure
if
this
one
is
incorrectly
listed
as
a
czech
pilsner
but
it
tastes
like
a
slightly
heavy
euro
lager
drinkability
is
decent
but
the
aroma
and
taste
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
poured
this
czech
pilsener
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
produced
an
average
head
nice
retention
and
it
left
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
some
slight
notes
of
lemon
citrus
light
in
body
this
pilsener
is
quite
refreshing
and
crisp
very
nice
mouthfeel
plenty
of
malted
grain
some
earthy
hop
qualities
very
nice
session
beer
would
make
for
a
great
summer
beer
a
lot
more
flavor
then
a
macro
brewed
lager
d
very
good
lots
of
malt
and
hop
character
as
well
as
a
smooth
lager
finish
almost
like
a
pale
ale
and
really
quite
good
for
what
it
is
o
this
is
better
than
a
typical
macro
lager
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
this
beer
is
quite
sessionable
and
wellsuited
for
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
would
have
been
fairly
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
if
i
was
thirsty
but
the
taste
was
something
i
didnt
care
to
reexperience
drinkability
is
good
its
unlike
what
i
usually
drink
so
i
could
drink
more
than
one
drinkability
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
palate
but
certainly
an
acceptable
brew
drinkability
not
awful
but
not
anything
special
either
almost
like
a
beer
pong
beer
really
though
not
cheap
enough
for
that
dont
drink
and
review
a
decent
simple
brew
i
was
on
vacation
and
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
its
like
the
water
they
brewed
it
with
was
laden
with
things
i
really
dont
want
to
be
consuming
or
they
used
an
odd
yeast
or
i
dunno
what
d
drinks
easily
enjoyable
in
the
heat
even
though
this
is
an
uneven
beer
its
still
somewhat
drinkable
it
had
a
more
complex
taste
than
i
was
expecting
not
bad
light
bodied
nicely
carbonated
and
highly
drinkable
good
beer
for
sure
overall
a
very
quality
session
beer
from
palmetto
i
could
drink
this
as
a
regular
very
easy
and
very
smooth
nothing
to
spectacular
or
unique
just
a
quality
lager
that
was
brewed
for
that
purpose
d
i
could
see
this
being
a
tangy
summer
party
lager
as
a
nice
choice
in
a
cooler
with
a
few
other
ales
the
drinkability
for
this
to
me
goes
up
with
the
heat
index
and
bbq
factor
i
would
certainly
go
for
this
out
of
a
freezing
cooler
on
a
hot
day
in
south
carolina
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
would
be
a
good
choice
as
a
nice
beer
you
can
have
a
few
of
without
feeling
really
full
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
that
fell
slowly
smells
a
bit
of
a
sweet
grain
and
malt
aroma
taste
very
well
balanced
some
sweet
malt
flavors
and
a
little
grassy
hop
bite
this
beer
went
down
smooth
and
fast
a
good
beer
to
have
a
few
of
thanks
again
to
oldirtysurfer
for
sharing
these
beers
with
me
this
would
be
a
good
camping
beer
the
beer
is
light
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
like
a
mass
produced
beer
with
a
sweeter
ending
the
taste
is
also
like
mass
produced
beer
but
without
the
harsh
corn
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
a
sessionable
beer
a
very
drinkable
bbq
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
have
not
had
many
of
this
style
purchased
in
a
mixed
6
pack
at
southern
market
in
myrtle
beach
no
dating
on
bottle
and

slight
hazy

in

carrying
a
full
white
head
that
disipates
very
quickly
nose
seems
to
have
a
yeasty
smell
to
it
some
what
out
of
place
in
a
lager
malt
also
present
in
nose
flavor
also
seem
s
to
carry
on
the
yeasty
tradition
then
malt
is
brought
out
in
muddy
mouthfeel
lacks
any
crispness
finish
is
short
and
along
the
style
but
leaves
you
wanting
something
else
or
possibly
this
a
bit
fresher
this
beer
is
plenty
drinkable
i
could
session
with
this
beer
it
is
not
the
tastiest
of
its
ilk
but
its
solid
i
like
it
i
sailed
through
my
glass
id
rather
drink
a
helles
or
a
pils
to
me
allmalt
lagers
fall
in
the
middle
this
one
wasnt
crisp
or
hoppy
enough
for
me
yet
it
wasnt
malty
enough
for
me
either
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
lovely
wellbrewed
beer
in
fact
this
might
be
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
had
if
not
it
is
top
three
for
sure
thank
you
timtheenchanta
for
the
enjoyable
south
carolina
brew
worth
a
try
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
frothy
head
that
laces
at
first
but
then
dissipates
it
smells
strongly
of
barley
and
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
the
malts
are
balanced
nicely
with
hops
it
has
a
good
body
to
it
with
even
carbonation
it
is
a
good
beer
for
easy
drinking
without
dipping
into
budmillercoors
i
dont
like
palmetto
lager
nearly
as
much
as
i
like
palmetto
porter
but
thats
probably
the
style
difference
talking
this
is
an
uncomplicated
uncluttered
ultimately
uninteresting
lager
whose
quality
i
can
nevertheless
appreciate
bottom
line
its
a
good
regional
wash
down
a
burger
kind
of
brew
that
deserves
some
measure
of
respect
thanks
to
wolfgang
for
the
bottle
drinkability
was
very
smooth
the
last
of
the
trifecta
of
palmetto
beers
triedpoured
a
nice
light
golden
with
a
pretty
big
frothylike
headaromas
are
pretty
grainy
with
a
light
citrusy
fruitiness
but
pretty
muted
very
refreshing
lager
with
some
nice
qualities
to
it
some
definant
graininess
and
a
touch
of
iron
finishing
with
a
just
a
light
amount
of
bitterness
a
smooth
easy
sociable
lager
great
for
get
togethersmaybe
something
to
give
a
macro
swill
drinker
so
they
can
taste
a
true
lager
beer
well
done
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
wish
it
was
available
when
i
was
at
school
in
charleston
12
ounce
bottle
more
like
an
ale
thatn
a
lager
but
very
easy
drinking
they
probably
used
6row
malt
on
this
beer
it
pours
gold
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
a
little
light
but
basically
malt
and
hops
with
maybe
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
and
has
a
nice
bit
of
flavor
without
being
overpowering
medium
and
somewhat
dry
in
the
mouth
a
pretty
decent
beer
to
drink
if
im
ever
in
sc
again
ill
have
another
this
is
one
refreshing
beer
i
think
when
i
move
back
down
to
sc
this
might
become
my
new
staple
in
the
fridge
its
got
a
well
balanced
proportion
of
hops
and
malts
which
are
a
little
on
the
light
side
but
that
aids
the
refreshingness
of
it
its
quite
smooth
and
goes
down
nice
and
easy
the
color
was
a
semicloudy
pale
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
tastes
were
of
the
light
fruits
persuasion
mixed
with
a
little
bit
of
honey
i
liked
this
one
and
i
will
definately
drink
more
of
this
drinkability
for
a
lager
not
bad
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
though
i
should
say
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
this
style
of
lager
dinning
yeah
ok
with
fish
i
hate
fish
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
this
one
big
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
searching
some
sc
beers
out
and
hauling
this
up
to

out
to
a
very
clear

with
peach
accents
forming
a
poofy
white
head
with
flocculent
clumps
retention
is
ok
and
lacing
is
delicate
carbonation
is
mild
to
moderate
aroma
is
interesting
like
sweet
cornbread
husky
pale
malts
and
soggy

taste
is
also
intriguing
with
an
odd
twang
of
semisweet

husks
butter
raw
crystal

freshly

is
somewhat
bubbly
and
sharp
with

toasty
semiastringent
finish
tettnager
or
hallertauer
are
evident
in
the
mildly
perfumy
yet
distinctly
noble
floral
finish
finishing
bitterness
is
moderate
and
the
husks
take
on
a
subtle
vanilla
character
towards
the
end
dunlap
hop
sacks
are
evident
throughout
despite
its
interesting
character
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
three
of
this
peculiar
brew
thanks
to
msr
kbub6f
i
have
in
front
of
me
my
first
carolina
beer
even
in
my
preba
days
im
not
sure
i
ever
had
a
carolina
beer
is
that
a
bad
thing
this
pale
ale
pours
a
textbook
amber
with
brilliant
clarity
and
a
really
impressive
smooth
clingy
lacey
head
of
lessthanwhite
foam
a
slight
acetaldehydeish
apple
aroma
underrode
a
decidedly
fresh
malt
aroma
a
good
dose
of
caramel
maltiness
crystal
i
believe
instantly
filled
my
mouth
followed
by
the
same
slight
appley
flavor
then
a
long
bitterbutnotveryhoppy
finish
the
fresh
crystal
malt
flavor
crept
back
into
the
tail
allowing
the
hopless
bitterness
to
subside
a
bit
passing
half
the
bottle
over
my
tongue
eventually
allowed
some
murky
nondescript
hop
flavor
to
edge
along
side
the
mild
bitterness
while
i
liked
the
nutty
almost
crackerlike
maltiness
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
the
faint
sour
apple
flavor
and
i
was
ambivalent
about
the
bitterness
sans
hoppiness
the
sourness
was
reminiscent
of
bass
and
the
bitterness
harkened
mcneils
beers
the
nutty
crystal
malt
flavor
conjured
images
of
most
american
pale
ales
brewed
in
the
english
style
all
told
this
was
a
fine
beer
but
nothing
exciting
solid
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
faded
fast
and
leaves
tiny
strings
of
lace
smell
is
of
citrusy
lightness
short
bright
crisp
fresh
and
pretty
soft
taste
is
mildly
crisp
light
with
a
crispy
sharp
sweet
bitterness
mellows
out
to
a
hollowness
in
the
finish
hops
are
a
bit
citrusy
and
lightly
balanced
in
with
the
malts
which
lend
to
be
a
bit
breadish
and
grainy
feel
is
a
lightermedium
body
with
a
slight
sharpness
and
lightly
textures
but
smoothing
not
a
bad
brew
could
use
some
added
boldness
and
more
flavor
but
still
pretty
enjoyable
and
drinkable
a
quality
american
lager
and
well
above
the
mass
produced
swill
a
great
session
beer
for
summer
one
of
palmettos
better
brews
palmetto
is
one
of
those
small
local
breweries
whose
beers
i
tend
to
enjoy
had
this
at
one
of
the
many
seafood
restaurants
that
dot
charleston
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
it
went
very
well
with
my
dish
although
the
waitress
had
recommended
palmetto
pale
ale
a
good
fullbodied
brew
with
a
nice
sense
of
hops
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
to
balance
the
malts
crisp
clean
taste
with
a
nearly
dry
finish
a
very
average
beer
but
good
on
a
hot
day
i
am
sure
not
much
taste
either
from
the
malt
or
the
hops
nothing
poorly
done
or
sloppy
just
not
much
to
be
gained
from
this
either
when
it
is
first
opened
or
as
it
warms
still
better
than
an
american
macro
but
just
not
as
good
as
the
better
american
lagers
like
a
stoudts
gold
or
a
great
lakes
dortmunder
as
near
to
perfect
pilsner
as
ive
had

a
hazy
straw

and
a

the
style

at

overall
is
a
refreshing

highly
sessionable
beer

the

mild

with
a

on
the
end
for

this
is
good
refreshing
mild
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
overall
pretty
enjoyable
clean
crisp
refreshing
and
enjoyable
not
the
greatest
pils
in
the
world
but
pretty
darn
good
the
taste
is
pretty
decent
with
spiciness
of
the
czech
hops
with
light
herbal
taste
and
gentle
malt
backing
up
the
hops
with
slight
toastiness
the
yeast
is
the
core
of
the
taste
with
european
influence
which
is
heavy
on
the
mineral
with
a
bit
of
musty
and
dry
flavor
and
light
grassy
herbal
hops
surround
the
malt
with
bitter
flavor
yet
more
spicy
almost
peppery
in
taste
indicating
saaz
to
me
which
fits
the
style
not
as
mellow
as
a
german
pils
but
in
general
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
and
a
very
drinkable
hoppy
lager
i
cant
account
for
other
reviews
that
are
not
stellar
other
than
to
think
that
those
reviewers
do
not
like
pilsners
after
almost
50
years
of
beer
drinking
i
think
i
can
say
that
the
current
trend
of
overly
hopped
ales
will
pass
and
good
pilsners
which
is
harder
to
make
you
cant
cover
things
up
with
more
hops
will
become
more
appreciated
overall
i
didnt
emphasize
on
this
beer
too
much
because
its
not
too
interesting
but
for
a
pilsner
its
solid
its
bittersweet
and
crisp
i
feel
like
they
do
lagers
much
better
but
this
is
not
at
all
bad
i
think
ive
enjoyed
just
about
every
beer
by
great
lakes
cheers
this
pours
out
a
very
light
strawgold
color
with
an
initial
halfinch
head
nice
flowery
hop
aroma
quite
big
definitely
on
the
hoppy
end
of
the
style
the
taste
greets
you
with
a
high
bitterness
and
lots
of
noble
hop
flavor
really
this
feels
more
like
a
german
than
czech
pils
malt
is
light
as
is
the
body
with
a
very
dry
finish
this
is
a
good
quaffing
pils
very
nice
overall
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
one
happy
to
get
my
hands
on
it
either
way
although
i
had
to
go
across
the
border
to
dc
o
pleasantly
surprised
as
this
is
my
first
great
lakes
product
i
would
definitely
return
to
this
at
the
price
of
1612
overall
a
truly
outstanding
czech
pils
from
an
american
brewery
the
hops
really
shine
here
but
a
creamy
malt
profile
and
crisp
yeast
notes
are
so
well
done
this
is
a
great
pils
that
is
a
no
brainer
as
a
summer
seasonal
golden
yellow
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
short
dense
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
sweet
bready
malt
and
floral
hop
aromas
with
earthy
grass
lemon
zest
and
toasted
malt
notes
medium
bodied
with
assertive
tangy
crisp
carbonation
and
a
clean
semidry
finish
bready
biscuity
malt
flavors
up
front
followed
by
tangy
herbal
hops
through
the
middle
hop
bitterness
gradually
intensifies
from
the
middle
to
the
end
as
this
finished
semidry
with
lingering
hop
bitterness
and
biscuity
notes
o
simple
but
well
crafted
showcases
the
noble
hops
while
i
like
the
body
of
this
beer
the
traditional
lightness
serves
the
style
well
this
is
a
little
more
robust
though
it
has
the
crispness
and
it
is
clean
poured
a
clear
gold
with
a
shortlived
fizzy
white
head
a
little
hangs
on
though
and
leaves
behind
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
light
but
pleasant
offering
some
floral
hops
and
a
light
biscuit
note
the
taste
is
good
but
seems
stuck
deciding
between
going
with
a
more
noblehop
forward
approach
or
a
more
bready
malty
path
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
its
missing
some
of
the
depth
either
one
of
those
aspects
offers
it
has
a
nice
thinner
weight
to
the
body
and
a
pleasant
dry
finish
it
is
a
very
good
pilsner
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
only
downside
is
this
beer
is
a
little
pricey
mouthfeel
gets
a
high
performance

this

you
bet
your
bottom

i
will
buy
this
brew
again

another
really

reminds

of

frankly
it
is

rather
simple

d
easy

could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
during

fantastic
pilsener
taste
for
as

this

may
be
my
new

o

its
not
a

good

just
not
outstanding
there
are

i

this

is
worth
a
try

i
probably
wont
buy

a
light
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
pretty
good
overall
my
aggro
pour
netted
me
two
big
foamy
fingers
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
srm
3
to
4
nose
was
redolent
with
fresh
mown
grass
and
fresh
cut
hay
it
must
be
towards
the
end
of
summer
mouthfeel
was
not
just
soft
but
also
viscous
and
it
sat
on
my
tongue
like
a
dollop
of
saaz
hops
pudding
more
please
momza
it
tasted
like
somebody
just
emptied
the
lawnmower
bag
into
the
kettle
and
walked
away
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
czechstyle
pilsners
especially
in
comparison
to
their
germanstyle
counterparts
and
this
was
one
of
the
best
yet
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
perfect
on
a
hot
humid
lateaugust
day
nice
carbonation
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
very
drying
in
the
finish
overall
i
must
say
im
never
let
down
when
i
buy
a
gl
product
this
one
is
no
different
i
got
this
at
the
great
price
of
9
99
a
sixer
a
really
good
session
beer
especially
when
the
temps
are
rising
a
fine
example
of
a
style
not
so
easy
to
find
well
done
in
the
us
another
example
of
how
great
lakes
built
their
outstanding
reputation
a
terrific
interpretation
of
a
classic
style
o
this
is
going
to
be
my
new
fridge
staple
during
this
time
of
year
the
smell
i
know
the
taste
i
dont
the
smell
is
enjoyable
in
its
familiarity
and
the
taste
is
really
a
lighter
version
of
it
it
is
quite
dry
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
overall
a
rather
nice
crisp
and
easy
drinking
yet
nicely
hopped
pilsner
overall
exactly
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
majority
of
the
great
lakes
beers
nice
and
well
done
a
go
to
in
the
style
heres
a
good
example
of
a
pilsener
that
can
easily
be
enjoyed
in
the
summer
it
is
rather
bitter
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
grain
and
floral
flavors
with
a
very
faint
citrus
element
it
goes
down
very
easy
without
being
thin
the
smell
and
taste
are
fresh
and
refreshing
moderate
carbonation
with
dryness
on
the
finish
this
is
one
of
the
best
pilseners
ive
had
overall
this
is
an
above
average
pilsener
very
refreshing
to
enjoy
on
a
nice
summer
eve
slightly
big
feel
for
a
lager
kinda
uninspiring

overall
this
beer
was
very
light
refreshing
and
easy
to
quaff
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
bit
mild
in
flavor
but
it
hit
the
spot
o
crisp
and
pure
pils
done
right
tasty
and
hits
the
spot
great

the
wright
pils

othe
main
knock
is
that
it
should
be
consumed
cold
but
one
of
the
better
pils
out
there
o

a
refreshing

with
plenty

d
not
the
most
exciting
of
beers
but
its
well
made
crisp

clean
great
pilsner
the
taste
is
full
of
hops
and
settles
nicely
5
3
abv
and
159
calories
are
a
nice
combination
got
to
support
cleveland
for
introducing
this
nice
blend
full
hops
with
a
dry
present
finish
this
is
a
great
combination
in
relation
to
cost
calories
and
taste
12oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
with
a
stringylacing
white
head
has
a
lightly
sweet
and
slightly
grainy
malty
nose
with
some
spicy
noble
hops
starts
with
a
mild
pale
malty
sweetness
with
assertive
earthy
and
peppery
noble
hop
flavor
and
bitter
balance
before
a
drier
clean
finish
true
to
style
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
satisfying
and
robust
pilsner
thats
also
gentle
and
abundant
its
expansive
and
the
aftertaste
lingers
almost
dry
with
the
cracker
and
sweetness
left
on
the
tongue
as
the
bitter
echos
at
the
back
of
the
throat
its
practically
weightless
and
crisp
great
lakes
has
done
it
again
with
a
robust
pilsener
that
you
can
easily
drink
all
day
my
overall
thoughts
of
this
beer
are
that
its
an
okay
offering
from
great
lakes
it
seems
to
be
an
attempt
to
get
some
business
from
people
that
usually
buy
ab
or
coors
the
thing
about
it
is
that
if
that
was
their
idea
behind
this
beer
its
a
pretty
big
failure
the
taste
is
radically
different
from
a
bud
this
would
be
too
bitter
for
a
person
that
drinks
bmc
all
the
time
overall
it
is
a
very
nice
refreshing
summertime
drink
its
not
the
best
great
lakes
has
to
offer
but
it
is
a
very
nice
drink
overall
drinkability
pretty
eh
for
great
lakes
overall
a
good
summer
beer
that
would
be
hard
to
dislike
for
anyone
who
likes
beer
wont
be
anyones
favorite
but
hey
its
a
pils
recommended
cheers
glad
i
picked
up
this
czech
pilsner
when
i
was
in
ohio
last
summer
it
seems
to
have
weathered
the
past
several
months
in
storage
and
the
trip
back
to
new
mexico
quite
well
as
this
is
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
had
although
a
little
lacking
in
appearance
this
beer
pairs
reasonably
complex
flavors
with
with
a
high
level
of
drinkability
although
a
bit
steeply
priced
at
8
50
a
six
in
ohio
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
again
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
has
a
great
all
round
offering
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
was
urine
sample
yellow
normally
colors
this
bright
are
reserved
for
kids
drinks
a
generous
white
head
was
a
sign
of
powerful
carbonation
which
was
definitely
evident
in
the
mouthfeel
a
grassy
aroma
was
present
as
expected
for
a
pilsner
in
the
initial
taste
one
gets
grass
sour
hay
and
a
mildly
tart
grain
taste
the
mild
sourness
continues
into
the
aftertaste
which
moves
in
quickly
because
of
the
carbonation
i
normally
skip
pilsners
and
now
i
remember
why
this
is
a
pilsner
so
it
is
great
lakes
attempt
at
a
beer
for
noncraft
drinkers
for
craft
beer
drinkers
it
tastes
a
little
more
like
a
high
end
macrobrew
a
decent
take
crisp
and
clean
wouldnt
be
hard
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
casual
hangout
worth
drinking
but
not
the
best
out
there
on
tap
at
the
great
lakes
location
in
the
cleveland
airport
pours
a
clear
straw
color
crisp
and
clean
but
without
quite
enough
hop
bite
dry
and
drinkable
overall
definitely
not
my
favorite
lager
but
i
would
say
its
in
my
upper
half
real
strong
grassy
nose
in
this
earthy
and
mildly
inky
flavor
on
this
but
overall
fairly
smooth
even
though
there
is
a
noticeable
bitter
tone
fairly
easy
to
drink
if
it
were
up
to
me
id
probably
tone
it
down
and
smooth
it
out
a
bit
still
a
nice
beer
though
overall
a
refreshing
beer
more
citrus
character
than
anticipated
and
less
cracker
flavor
more
bitter
than
most
o
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
enjoyable
flavors
but
a
little
too
strong
to
be
a
session
beer
o
good
but
not
great
i
wont
actively
seek
this
one
in
the
future
but
great
lakes
yet
again
put
out
a
solid
brew
great
lakes
clearly
knows
how
to
brew
a
lager
this
being
another
excellent
rendition
of
its
style
very
clean
and
refreshing
beer
with
no
lack
of
flavor
ono
surprise
here
another
top
notch
lager
from
gl
not
as
hop
forward
as
prima
pils
or
noble
pils
but
a
nice
drinker
and
a
rock
solid
pils
overall
it
should
be
no
surprise
that
great
lakes
makes
a
tasty
and
refreshing
pils
like
the
wright
pils
enjoy
anyone
else
feel
this
beer
is
just
an
addicts
rallying
cry
bring
me
the
right
pills
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
soapy
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
funky
wheat
flowers
sharp
grass
and
minerals
the
taste
takes
out
the
funk
and
drives
home
the
flowerygrassy
nature
of
the
hops
providing
a
nicely
bitter
wash
without
overdoing
it
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
very
nice
pils
one
of
the
better
american
examples
ive
had
in
recent
memory
good
pilsner
not
my
favorite
but
i
could
definitely
go
for
another
sometime
good
smooth
taste
basic
beer
flavor
with
little
aftertaste
a
little
bitter
and
watery
as
compared
to
a
belgium
beer
stella
artois
i
enjoy
a
more
creamy
consistency
with
a
smoother
flavor
and
a
more
flowery
aftertaste
most
people
would
enjoy
this
beer
however
it
doesnt
have
much
memorable
qualities
a
really
nice
light
pilsener
id
get
this
in
the
summertime
to
share
with
friends
pours
straw
colored
almost
light
gold
with
nice
fluffy
white
head
great
carbonation
smells
bready
like
white
bread
crisp
with
light
floral
hop
notes
very
clean
crisp
tasting
with
nice
even
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
light
pilsner
malt
sweetness
light
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
nice
beer
another
excellent
offering
from
great
lakes
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
spicy
hop
bite
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
and
pale
malts
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
hop
character
is
really
nice
with
the
perfect
amount
of
dry
bitterness
that
doesnt
overpower
the
other
notes
earthy
and
slightly
funky
with
a
sticky
grassy
feel
giving
off
subtle
pine
and
straw
flavor
this
is
countered
by
sweet
light
fruit
notes
especially
apple
and
pear
as
well
as
some
bread
biscuit
and
pilsner
malt
well
balanced
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
doesnt
look
or
smell
all
that
great
but
its
a
pretty
nice
beer
poured
into
my
pils
glass
a
light
yellow
with
fluffy
white
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
floating
upward
smells
a
bit
earth
like
with
grass
and
grain
aromas
taste
is
crisp
slightly
thin
at
first
then
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
with
some
grassy
hop
flavors
overall
i
find
this
pils
to
be
super
drinkable
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
midlevel
carbonation
that
foams
the
beer
slightly
across
the
palate
closes
dryly
with
longlingering
noble
hop
bitterness
12oz
bottle
pours
a
pale

with
a
tall
foamy
white

good

i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
overall
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
stands
up
to
a
few
of
the
well
known
pilseners
out
there
i
need
to
try
this
fresher
very
true
to
the
style
an
easy
drinker
anyone
can
enjoy
a
good
beer
but
really
a
little
boring
theres
nothing
to
grab
you
and
reel
you
in
o
pretty
good
take
on
a
czech
pilsner
perfect
on
a
hot
day
or
for
sessioning
with
friends
a
nicely
balanced
beer
that
you
could
use
to
introduce
novice
beer
drinkers
to
a
better
than
average
pils
pours
crystal
clear
blond
color
with
a
rising
white
head
that
has
okay
retention
smells
more
hoppy
than
most
of
these
with
some
citrus
hops
notes
on
top
of
the
stamdard
pilsener
malts
flavor
is
very
crisp
and
dry
very
summery
the
hops
are
there
for
sure
which
makes
this
one
more
appealing
to
me
mouthfeel
is
nice
more
medium
than
light
on
the
body
with
fine
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
little
bitter
but
its
very
quick
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
nice
brew
pours
a
clean
deep
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
somewhat
malty
and
a
small
hop
presence
in
the
taste
a
small
hop
but
again
malty
for
a
pils
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
saaz
hop
in
the
aftertaste
fresh
and
malty
nice
presence
of
hops
enjoyable
overall
a
very
solid
american
take
on
a
pilsner
nice
grassy
hop
presence
to
balance
the
sweetness
nice
to
have
this
more
widely
available
as
a
seasonal
olight
crisp
and
clean
great
representation
of
the
style
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
poured
into
a
pilsner
a
light
golden
with
a
thinner
frothy
white
head
that
sticks
wellquite
sprtitzy
in
its
looks

have
a
bit
of

more
toasty

comes
into

as
well

of
what
a
pilsner
should
betoasty
with
a

finishi
like
the
toast
most
of
all
a
great
pilsner
with
real
flavorits
toasted
with
a
shot
of
noble

a
pretty
average
pilsner
nothing
too
distinct
about
it
enjoyed
my
pour
the
wright
pilsner
glides
into
the
glass
with
a
yellowish
golden
look
in
color
and
nothing
in
terms
of
bubbles
i
poured
this
hard
and
only
managed
some
bubbles
around
the
side
of
the
glass
that
die
off
no
lace
smell
is
pretty
bright
with
fresh
german
style
hops
noble
i
presume
some
perfume
and
some
pale
malt
standard
pilsner
scents
but
bold
and
pungent
taste
is
off
the
charts
with
bold
pilsner
vibes
noble
hops
some
grass
slight
florals
and
some
pale
malt
in
the
end
keeping
things
in
check
very
crisp
on
the
mouth
while
the
look
suggests
no
carbonation
the
feel
is
far
from
dead
light
bodied
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
i
knew
this
would
be
a
hit
great

always
does

taste
is
malty
up

with
a
refreshing

nice
version
of
this
style
highly
recommended
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
noble
hop
presence
still
very
drinkable
and
worth
trying
just
a
little
boring
the
taste
isnt
overpowering
but
is
clear
and
strong
bread
and
earthy
notes
color
the
malt
but
the
hops
assert
themselves
nicely
as
well
the
crispness
of
the
texture
hits
the
style
to
a
tee
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
full
hoppy
aftertaste
one
of
the
best
czech
pilsners
ive
ever
had
this
is
an
expertly
brewed
pils
and
i
would
highly
recommend
you
try
it
right
up
there
with
avery
victory
and
lagunitas
as
my
favorite
pils
id
much
rather
drink
these
ultrafresh
pils
from
these
brewers
than
skunky
urquell
or
hop
extract
bitburger
o
good
all
around
pilsner
that
by
know
means
will
blow
your
mind
but
will
give
you
an
enjoyable
brew
to
drink
on
a
warm
sunny
day
great
lakes
bc
do
a
lot
of
great
brews
but
its
not
all
about
the
ales
with
them
as
they
pay
tribute
and
respect
to
old
fashioned
lagers
and
they
do
it
in
a
high
quality
manner
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
a
few
of
their
other
lagers
but
its
still
a
damn
fine
choice
and
offers
a
quality
pilsner
i
guarantee
its
better
than
any
other
pilsner
youll
find
on
the
shelf
around
the
same
time
of
year
its
a
brew
to
try
for
certain
12
ounce
bottle
poured
in
a
pilsener
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
grainy
malt
along
with
some
grassy

spicy
hops
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
slight
floral
hops
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
crisp
and
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
id
certainly
buy
this
again
overall
i
hate
to
give
such
a
low
score
to
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
that
aftertaste
messes
up
what
should
be
a
nice
refreshing
beer
also
i
see
very
little
reason
to
have
this
when
glbc
offers
up
the
much
better
dortmunder
gold
year
round
solid
all
around
hops
profile
seemed
more
germaninfluenced
than
czech
but
when
it
comes
to
lagers
in
this
part
of
the
spectrum
i
cant
claim
to
have
the
greatest
ability
for
discernment
clean
start
with
lively
carbonation
a
touch
of
grain
toward
the
middle
with
a
restrained
slightly
herbal
hoppyness
to
the
finish
not
bad
malt
character
lacks
a
little
even
for
a
bo
pils
brewers
who
do
it
right
overall
this
is
pretty
well
balanced
pils
the
various
flavors
can
all
be
tasted
seperately
and
do
not
run
together
good
for
a
session
on
a
hot
summer
day
appearance
is
pale
gold
with
white
head
that
retains
nicely
and
leaves
a
thick
layer
of
lacing
nose
is
full
of
fresh
czech
hops
which
provide
a
grassy
green
aroma
this
is
paired
with
sturdy
cereal
grains
stone
wheat
and
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
taste
is
rather
bitter
with
bready
grain
all
over
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
earthy
flavors
mouthfeel
is
crisp
light
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
another
well
crafted
lager
from
great
lakes
with
a
firm
hop
presence
i
love
this
brewery
and
just
how
they
make
simple
good
honest
beer
this
beer
is
wonderful
o
the
wright
pils
is
a
damn
fine
beer
over
all
but
when
it
comes
to
a
czech
pilsner
this
one
is
flying
a
different
pattern
its
got
the
nose
of
a
classic
czech
but
it
just
doesnt
follow
through
with
moderately
bold
noble
hops
and
the
soft
floral
spice
and
bitterness
they
impart
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
regardless
this
is
pretty
straight
forward
nothing
flashy
but
very
well
executed
traditional
pilsener
fans
should
enjoy
quaffable
stuff
here
this
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
yellow
with
a
little
white
head
that
stays
all
the
way
down
not
much
on
the
nose
some
grainyness
and
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
very
grainy
crisp
some
wheat
and
hay
there
is
also
a
slight
fruitiness
from
whatever
hop
they
used
this
beer
has
a
nice
feel
to
it
and
goes
down
clean
smooth
and
easy
a
beer
for
any
beer
drinker
a
solid
pilsner
and
much
like
everything
else
great
lakes
does
it
wont
disappoint
this
is
a
disappointing
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
its
grainy
and
warm
which
is
something
i
would
expect
from
an
adjunct
offering
there
are
many
better
selections
for
this
style
o
for
me
this
has
become
my
go
to
beer
this
summer
hard
to
put
down
and
hard
to
only
have
one
nice
job
12
ounce
bottle
into
pilsener
glass
best

pours
a
fairly
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
12
finger
dense
white
head
with
very
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
good
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
streaming
up
aromas
of
lemon
apple
herbal
grass
bread
floral
and
light
pepper
very
nice
and
pleasant
aromas
with
good
balance
taste
of
lemon

bready
grain
and
herbal
spiciness
light
spicy

on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of

floral

and
herbal
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
very
nice
balance
of
flavors
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
as
well
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
very
nice
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
almost
no
warming
noticed
at
all
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pilsner
good
flavor
robustness
and
balance
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
highly
enjoyable
and
spot
on
to
style
the
draft
had
a
little
bit
hoppier
feel
to
it
the
bottled
a
little
darker
somehow
but
very
similar
overall
this
is
what
i
would
call
robundant
especially
for
the
style
it
feels
full
bodied
and
more
authentic
than
the
real
thing
real
good
pils
nice
flavor
balance
easy
going
refreshing
one
of
the
better
pils
ive
ever
had
overall
4
55
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
a
pretty
tasty
czech
style
pils
clean
and
well
lagered
o
a
fine
representation
of
a
czech
pils
but
not
my
favorite
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
good
pilz
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
maltier
side
compared
to
its
german
counterparts
i
like
the
freshness
dates
great
lakes
is
using
so
you
know
you
are
getting
something
thats
not
ancient
unlike
some
overseas
pilz
that
come
in
green
bottles
with
no
freshness
dates
at
all
in
nearly
any
other
style
the
combinations
of
corn
sulfur
and
butter
would
be
an
immediate
detractor
regarless
of
how
slight
the
tastes
are
but
the
union
in
this
beer
gives
added
fullness
both
in
flavor
and
texture
perhaps
this
doesnt
work
for
every
pilsner
unless
its
the
wright
pils
the
beer
pours
an
outstandingly
vibrant
looking
straw
yellow
there
is
no
haze
or
sediment
a
half
inch
a
pure
white
head
crowns
the
beer
and
loosely
laces
down
the
sides
while
drinking
there
is
ample
visible
carbonation
as
well
the
nose
is
slightly
bitter
and
grainy
there
are
no
distinguishable
fruitpine
notes
to
the
beers
hops
relatively
nondistinct
with
a
vigorous
swirl
there
is
a
slight
cheesy
butteriness
and
tomato
that
competes
with
the
malts
sweetness
the
taste
is
all
pilsner
with
a
crisp
light
hoppiness
followed
by
a
semidry
lingering
sweetness
flavorful
and
drinkable
summer
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
off
a
little
more
citruslemon
in
the
back
end
would
really
make
this
beer
something
special
for
me
overall
this
is
a
great
bar
beer
something
you
could
drink
a
few
of
bottle
from
the
village
beer
merchant
a
not
true
czech
pils
consistent
with
many
i
have
had
in
that
realm
it
has
a
bit
of
cheesy
aroma
slightly
cloudy
body
middling
mouthfeel
soso
drinkability
with
some
bitterness
and
lemony
suitable
carbonation
dry
finish
pours
a
clear
straw
golden
color
with
a
retentive
fluffy
white
pillowy
head
and
ample
clumps
of
lace
miley
sweet
aroma
of
bread
malt
noble
hops
grass
and
lemon
grainy
and
biscuit
flavor
gives
way
to
a
light
lemon
and
earth
dryness
and
a
mild
floral
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
diacetyl
mid
palate
adds
a
pleasant
smoothness
to
the
well
carbonated
soft
medium
body
nothing
too
bold
but
no
complaints
another
lovely
lager
from
glbc
moreys
bottom
line
honestly
i
was
expecting
more
hops
this
is
a
good
pilsner
for
sure
but
great
lakes
usually
isnt
shy
when
it
comes
to
bitterness
and
flavor
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
for
summer
drinking
though
im
partial
to
hoppy
pilsners
myself
but
if
youre
not
quite
ready
for
prima
pils
then
this
would
be
a
good
first
step
up
from
macro
beers
overall
if
i
am
in
the
market
for
a
pils
i
will
buy
this
again
great
summer
beer
o
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
czech
pilseners
but
this
seems
to
represent
the
style
well
goes
down
easy
and
enjoyable
though
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
often
i
always
enjoy
a
fresh
pilsner
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
this
one
is
no
exception
there
were
off
flavors
that
kept
this
one
from
the
very
top
of
list
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
about
average
for
the
style
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
version
of
the
style
its
light
refreshing
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
clean
and
refreshing
upfront
with
a
bitter
hop
punch
in
the
back
heightened
by
good
carbonation
chewy
malt
bread
qualities
come
out
towards
the
end
along
with
an
herb
bitterness
that
all
but
hides
the
subtle
sweet
caramel
notes
finishes
dry
12
ounce
bottle
surprisingly
there
wasnt
a
best
by
date
printed
on
the
label
of
any
of
the
bottles
in
the
6
pack
i
just
bought
but
since
this
just
came
out
in
bottles
recently
i
cant
imagine
its
very
old
at
all
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
grainy
malt
along
with
some
grassy
and
spicy
hops
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
slight
floral
hops
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
crisp
and
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
at
just
8
99
a
6
pack
id
certainly
buy
this
again
overall
while
this
beer
is
far
from
being
groundbreaking
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
a
wonderful
thirst
quencher
and
a
great
summertime
brew
that
i
wish
more
breweries
would
make
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
outstanding
pilsner
brew
great
lakes
shows
again
their
ability
to
brew
an
incredibly
diverse
portfolio
superb
m
light
bodied
decent
carbonation
o
one
of
the
best
pilsners
available
what
a
great
choice
to
make
this
a
new
seasonal
and
available
outside
of
the
brewery
those
preferring
hoppier
pils
may
not
be
as
impressed
with
this
one
as
the
hops
add
a
nice
sweetness
and
spiciness
but
do
not
take
center
stage
this
beer
is
all
about
balance
and
lightness
and
it
has
these
in
spades
great
lakes
truly
is
a
champion
at
lagering
and
the
wright
pils
stands
proudly
with
eliot
ness
and
dortmunder
as
a
great
lager
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
topped
by
a
big
frothy
white
head
the
nose
is
remarkably
fragrant
very
floral
and
doughy
with
a
touch
of
cooked
corn
and
citrus
zest
the
yeast
profile
is
decidedly
czech
being
more
buttery
and
creamy
than
sulfuric
palate
is
very
nice
with
floral
and
grassy
hop
flavors
up
front
followed
by
doughy
creamy
soft
pils
malt
flavors
dms
and
diacetyl
are
present
at
a
low
level
signature
of
czech
pilsner
giving
the
beer
a
softer
character
than
the
german
counterpart
finishes
mildly
bittersweet
this
beer
is
hard
to
put
down
great
lakes
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
lagers
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
on
the
palate
and
easily
sessionable
freshness
really
matters
for
this
brew
in
the
end
it
is
nothing
particularly
special
from
glbc
or
to
to
style
in
general
overall
excellent
pils
for
sure
sweet
flavorful
easy
to
drink
and
low
alcohol
make
this
a
summertime
winner
very
glad
this
is
now
avaible
outside
the
cleveland
area
a
welcomed
addition
to
the
strong
lineup
one
of
the
better
pils
out
there
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
little
above
average
example
of
a
czech
pilsener
the
aroma
was
a
little
odd
but
after
that
the
clean
and
crisp
flavors
that
i
expected
shined
through
this
beer
had
really
good
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
and
clean
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
summer
day
while
grilling
outside
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
and
the
crisp
and
clean
flavors
this
beer
also
looked
pretty
good
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
lack
of
hops
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
hop
flavors
and
i
think
the
finish
should
have
an
assertive
bitterness
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
clean
and
easy
drinking
pilsener
but
its
not
my
favorite
in
style
i
do
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
especially
if
you
dont
want
a
lot
of
bitterness
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewing
company
glbc
hardly
disappoints
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
overall
very
good
summer
beer
i
hope
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
on
tap
i
think
harris
grill
is
serving
it
tomorrow
night
i
am
going
to
try
and
be
there
tastebiscuit
crackersubtle
floral
hop
note
comes
and
hangs
around
to
the
finish
very
easydrinking
and
refreshing
a
fine
summer
offering
overall
drinkability
for
what
it
lacks
in
aroma
it
makes
up
for
in
taste
and
drinkability
i
could
easily
have
another
of
these
and
it
went
quite
well
with
a
meal
fish
potato
cakes
as
well
a
good
czech
pilsner
o
a
very
good
beer
when
compared
to
great
lakes
reigning
lager
king
their
dortmunder
gold
it
falters
a
bit
but
on
its
own
this
is
top
notch
american
brewed
czechstyle
pilsner
yet
again
great
lakes
flexes
their
lagering
muscles
one
i
had
at
the
brewery
in
january
and
loved
im
stoked
to
finally
have
plenty
of
this
chilling
in
my
fridge
big
thumbs
up
pours
a
sparkling
straw
gold
color
under
a
purewhite
frothy
head
drippy
sheets
of
lace
but
no
head
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
clean
aromas
of
spicy
grassy
hops
hay
and
crackerlike
grain
softly
sweet
cereal
malt
flavor
with
a
bitter
grassyherbal
hop
finish
crisp
and
snappy
in
the
mouth
light
bodied
and
refreshing
i
think
the
malt
could
be
a
bit
richer
to
counteract
the
hops
but
a
nice
take
on
the
style
that
ill
revisit
this
summer
im
sure
pours
a
crystal
clear
and
clean
straw
golden
yellow
with
a
1
finger
white
fluffy
head
that
forms
a
thin
lace
smells
of
sweet
grain
a
tinge
of
floral
hop
like
character
coming
through
on
the
end
nothing
exciting
boiled
grains
and
sweet
sugary
lemons
on
the
tongue
a
sweet
bready
malt
base
leaves
a
tad
tart
with
a
slightly
bitter
and
dry
finish
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
sweet
dry
and
a
bitter
finish
overall
this
beer
is
far
from
exciting
not
unlike
all
pilsners
just
a
pretty
standard
pils
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
background
bitterness
dry
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
grape
character
left
on
the
tongue
edit
two
months
later
there
isnt
any
sulfur
and
there
is
a
low
level
of
diacetyl
that
lends
a
mild
fruitiness
this
beer
is
better
upping
my
overall
score
to
4
0
overall
as
a
fan
of
great
lakes
ill
say
that
this
isnt
their
best
but
it
certainly
has
a
lot
to
offer
diehard
great
lakes
drinkers
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
pilsners
but
this
beer
could
make
me
one
it
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
extremely
wellbalanced
i
think
all
it
really
needs
are
a
few
more
bubbles
i
bought
a
single
of
this
and
i
think
ill
go
back
to
the
bottle
shop
for
a
sixpack
heck
i
might
even
drink
one
out
of
a
pilsner
cheers
looking
at
the
grain
bill
from
gl
and
im
pretty
surprised
to
see
that
there
is
no
pils
malt
listed
at
all
a
little
odd
for
a
style
originating
from
the
malt
itself
mineral
water
bitterness
up
front
along
with
some
grainy
flavors
herbal
hops
blend
with
peppery
and
lemony
notes
lightly
toasted
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
slight
honey
note
as
well
sea
air
noble
hop
wallop
as
the
finish
nears
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
with
latent
lemon
pepper
hop
bitterness
moderate
body
with
a
crisp
lively
feel
a
delicious
and
very
quaffable
summer
seasonal
that
i
would
drink
yearround
if
it
was
available
o
overall
i
was
not
impressed
and
i
was
truly
excited
to
try
this
one
too
there
is
a
graininess
to
all
the
gl
lagers
that
is
odd
to
me
ill
stick
to
victory
for
my
lagers
or
the
germans
sad
because
i
love
great
lakes
for
most
other
things
o
this
is
a
great
pilsener
in
my
opinion
it
ranks
up
there
with
sunshine
pils
and
prima
pils
nice
work
by
great
lakes
id
grab
a
case
of
this
every
summer
if
they
start
to
make
it
more
regularly
great
lakes
spin
on
a
czech
pils
light
in
color
and
flavor
smell
is
a
bit
light
but
the
floral
hops
do
come
out
a
bit
the
taste
has
hints
of
great
lakes
malt
backbone
but
not
that
much
honestly
its
just
very
light
in
every
way
flashes
of
floral
hops
do
show
up
in
the
taste
but
its
nothing
all
that
fancy
not
my
favorite
gl
seasonal
o
a
confusing
beer
the
aroma
is
way
off
the
taste
is
pretty
good
ill
enjoy
this
beer
but
not
sure
i
would
buy
more
i
was
expecting
more
from
gl
who
makes
an
excellent
everything
almost
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
golden
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
earthy
and
lemon
to
it
the
taste
has
a
nice
balance
of
the
biscuity
malts
and
the
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
really
good
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
long
time
anticipating
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
thanks
to
my
cousin
joe
i
landed
3
bottles
in
my
dedicated
beer
fridge
pours
a
beautiful
pale
golden
slightly
hazed
color
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
thick
leaves
behind
even
layered
speckled
lacing
perfect
grassy
pils
in
every
way
aromatics
end
up
with
a
hint
of
lemon
citrus
notes
and
herbal
earthy
noble
hops
kicking
flavor
is
light
biscuit
pale
malt
bready
complex
for
how
light
and
drinkable
this
beer
is
more
nice
hop
interplay
with
the
malts
bringing
out
a
dry
finish
in
each
sip
nice
perfect
crisp
czech
style
pils
i
cant
wait
til
this
is
distributed
as
the
summer
seasonal
this
year
it
will
simply
be
my
staple
this
summer
lawnmower
beer
good
drinkable
and
super
refreshing
mine
is
served
a
bit
cold
but
its
perfect
refreshing
pilsener
that
im
ready
to
get
more
of
this
was
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
and
sold
to
go
from
the
gift
shop
overall
this
an
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
pilsner
with
a
unique
heartland
taste
o
a
drinkable
beer
that
could
be
a
great
gateway
to
craft
beer
great
lakes
has
a
lot
more
interesting
beers
though
i
wish
there
would
have
been
more
of
a
hop
presence
overall
great
beer
too
bad
its
only
in
the
gift
shop
and
at
the
pub
poured
out
bright
yellow
and
crystal
clear
a
lot
of
carbonation
leaving
a
big
two
finger
head
that
drops
down
to
a
thin
layer
nose
is
sweet
pilsner
malt
and
earthy
herbal
hops
the
flavor
pops
out
better
than
the
nose
big
light
and
malty
tangy
sweetness
upfront
but
then
a
big
biscuit
flavor
builds
from
the
middle
getting
stronger
at
the
finish
the
end
also
brings
out
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
that
stands
out
against
the
malt
but
isnt
overwhelming
light
body
that
is
crisp
and
clean
the
whole
way
through
if
i
had
better
access
to
this
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
it
pours
a
light
hazy
straw
color
with
a
thin
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lace
the
aroma
is
of
grass
and
straw
with
hints
of
bread
the
aroma
is
inviting
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
bready
backbone
followed
by
a
grassy
and
earthy
slight
hop
bite
and
a
hint
of
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
overall
it
is
a
solid
pilsner
there
is
a
nice
mild
overall
flavor
with
a
nice
aroma
overall
a
standard
czech
pils
very
drinkable
and
fit
for
this
august
day
would
prefer
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
but
still
very
tasty
great
lakes
brewing
should
do
everyone
a
favor
and
makes
this
available
during
the
spring
and
summer
on
a
widespread
basis
limiting
sales
to
the
gift
shop
is
a
mistake
the
wright
pils
is
nothing
short
of
a
fantastic
representation
a
czech
pilsener
and
it
should
be
much
more
available
im
blown
away
i
was
not
expecting
this
if
you
live
outside
the
cleveland
area
do
yourself
a
favor
and
trade
for
it
im
glad
to
have
picked
this
up
i
find
good
pilsners
generally
to
be
too
similar
to
one
another
and
this
one
frankly
is
no
exception
they
are
good
you
enjoy
them
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
one
good
pilsner
from
another
perhaps
this
ones
claim
to
fame
is
a
slightly
more
hopbitter
finish
than
your
typical
pilsner
i
bet
this
like
the
holy
moses
would
be
better
on
tap
o
this
is
a
great
rep
of
the
style
the
style
while
not
my
favorite
showcases
this
as
a
nice
summer
drinker
while
not
my
first
choice
in
beers
this
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
the
only
thing
i
dont
understand
is
why
this
beer
is
bottled
but
not
distributed
overall
refreshing
and
flavorful
and
though
the
sweetness
is
a
surprise
it
is
a
nice
complement
to
the
profile
d
a
fantastically
sessionable
beer
that
tastes
good
enough
to
want
to
one
of
the
better
czech
pilsners
i
have
had
from
the
u
s
d
this
stuff
goes
down
easier
than
water
and
it
feels
so
light
on
the
palettenot
because
of
a
lack
of
flavor
but
because
the
finish
is
done
so
well
really
could
drink
a
6pack
without
trying
a
highquality
pilsner
mvery
light
and
crisp
d
i
preferred
this
on
tap
as
i
do
most
beers
but
it
is
still
the
most
enjoyable
beer
that
i
have
had
in
this
style
very
refreshing
a
pils
thats
defined
by
its
best
characteristic
one
could
drink
these
by
the
sixpack
without
complaint
good
solid
beer
theres
enough
funny
stuff
about
the
finish
of
this
beer
to
make
me
happy
to
be
done
after
one
but
its
perfectly
drinkable
smooth
a
touch
sweet
floral
and
a
tiny
bitter
bite
on
the
finish
this
offering
needs
to
find
wider
distribution
i
live
in
a
market
that
gets
all
of
the
gl
bottled
offerings
but
havent
seen
this
one
before
id
low
to
be
able
to
get
this
in
bottles
it
would
be
the
perfect
gateway
baby
step
for
a
bmc
drinker
looking
to
get
into
craft
whole
providing
enough
interest
to
appeal
to
a
seasoned
beer
geek
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
pilsener
malt
with
a
lot
of
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
grassy
hops
and
lighter
malts
with
some
low
bitterness
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
americanmade
pilsener
taste
was
ok
not
much
flavor
to
it
easy
to
drink
nothing
seemed
special
about
this
one
it
disappointed
me
because
i
usually
look
forward
to
a
gl
d
eh
veggies
and
corn
is
strong
here
also
a
bit
sweet
which
mostly
hides
a
pleasantly
subtle
hop
bite
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
though
not
too
appealing
on
the
palate
drinkability
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
i
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
classic
pilsner
with
mildly
hoppy
and
citrus
finish
bottle
grabbed
this
on
a
recent
visit
to
the
brewery
and
brew
pub
pours
a
clean
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
no
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
going
on
except
for
some
slight
hops
and
grapefruit
notes
clean
and
crisp
flavor
some
citrus
notes
has
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
to
it
very
good
and
refreshing
overall
for
a
pils
drinkability
was
low
sure
the
light
character
of
the
beer
and
low
abv
make
it
an
easy
drinker
but
the
flavor
wound
up
being
way
too
offputting
my
wife
who
ordered
it
didnt
want
to
finish
it
and
we
had
the
bar
tender
exchange
it
for
an
edmund
fitzgerald
sorry
wright
pils
but
you
didnt
make
the
cut
notes
a
special
treat
to
have
this
giftshop
exclusive
in
bottles
from
great
lakes
it
was
available
on
tap
inside
the
brewery
as
well
but
i
did
not
get
the
chance
to
enjoy
it
there
this
is
a
solid
american
craft
pilsener
d
a
very
pleasant
easy
drinking
pilsner
from
great
lakes
it
was
certainly
refreshing
on
a
hot
afternoon
and
this
is
a
welcome
summer
seasonal
in
my
book
if
great
lakes
is
looking
for
a
new
summer
seasonal
they
need
look
no
further
than
the
wright
pils
this
should
be
the
blueprint
for
any
u
s
craft
brewer
who
wants
to
compete
with
the
best
that
germany
and
the
czech
republic
have
to
offer
thanks
to
my
brother
for
giving
up
his
only
bottle
so
that
i
could
do
a
review
exceptional
drinkability
very
very
tasty
while
still
being
light
crisp
and
refreshing
can
i
have
another
overall
a
very
solid
pils
one
of
the
better
pils
i
have
had
very
drinkable
and
well
to
the
style
d
drinks
very
easily
and
is
pretty
interesting
for
a
pilsner
pours
a
strawyellow
with
small
tight
white
head
and
very
little
lacing
smells
of
grassy
hops
and
almost
like
whole
wheat
bread
lots
of
bready
flavour
to
go
with
the
grassy
hop
bitterness
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
great
drinker
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
lot
going
on
with
this
but
it
is
a
very
well
made
pilsner
if
this
was
available
near
me
i
may
buy
it
more
thin
beer
with
a
slight
aftertaste
mild
sweetness
up
front
and
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
overall
i
think
its
ok
but
not
great
second
taste
quite
drinkable
some
mild
bitterness
at
the
back
but
the
aftertaste
it
gone
again
a
mild
sweetness
and
a
nice
finish
i
rather
like
this
beer
for
a
regular
pilsner
you
arent
going
to
find
many
beers
better
than
this
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
great
pilsner
plus
some
malt
happiness
thrown
in
there
for
good
measure
however
it
is
a
pilsner
and
pilsners
are
middle
of
the
road
and
made
for
your
average
beer
drinker
the
craft
spirit
is
alive
in
the
wright
pils
so
lets
hope
this
keeps
them
on
the
wright
track
how
about
imperial
black
and
wright
pilsner
just
a
suggestion
the
drinkability
is
100
each
sip
leaves
you
wanting
another
this
is
what
a
pilsner
should
be
good

drinkable

down

of
these

drinkability
delicious
and
easily
sessionable
though
i
will
understand
if
those
at
the

move
on
to
other
offerings
after
this
much
thanks
is
in
order
to
greg
who
brought
me
a
sixer
of
these
hes
not
a
ba
not
even
a
beer
drinker
but
has
the
spirit
of
one
and
was
nice
enough
to
hook
me
up
with
these
and
wouldnt
even
let
me
pay
him
i
should
have
asked
for
a
growler
of
rackhouse
huh
overall
i
cant
say
that
a
whole
lot
was
going
on
with
this
beer
but
it
was
a
pretty
good
representation
for
the
style
if
this
is
your
type
of
beer
i
could
easily
see
this
being
sessionable
a
bit
full
for
the
style
with
lower

pretty
easy

a

eric
dit
really
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
went
over
to
the
gift
shop
to
try
and
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
but
they
didnt
have
them
yet
easily
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
a
pilsener
overall
i
wont
lie
pilseners
arent
my
favorite
and
i
have
had
a
lot
of
shitty
ones
this
one
was
done
very
well
and
had
a
lot
of
flavor
definitely
unexpected
another
great
beer
from
glbc
says
review
is
optional
it
is
not
o
i
think
lakefront
made
this
well
and
the
score
is
really
deceiving
if
you
want
to
try
a
well
made
local
pils
give
this
one
a
go
the
low
score
does
not
give
it
justice
overall
a
delicious
beer
quite
appropriate
to
the
style
the
bodys
a
little
too
big
for
a
pils
but
its
balance
of
crispness
and
smoothness
works
fairly
well
despite
that
it
isnt
especially
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
touch
heavy
for
a
pilsner
the
carbonation
is
on
point
and
the
finish
is
nice
overall
this
is
a
belowaverage
pilsner
that
is
lacking
in
impressive
points
refreshing
but
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
pilsner
at
all
o
good
o
overall
easy
flavor
but
leans
way
to
much
on
the
sweet
and
buttery
side
limiting
drinkability
not
true
to
typical
style
i
would
pass
on
this
one
per
style
looking
at
the
ratings
for
this
beer
id
say
that
freshness
is
definitely
the
key

enjoying

that

surprisingly
i
am
getting
a

that

the
taste
is
like
practically
every
other
pilsner
ive
ever
drank
which
means
its
passable
considering
the
limitations
of
this

but
pretty
bland
in

there
is
a

however
i

i
will

to

that
im

try

pretty

o

pilsner
that
is

its
a
moderately

beer
not
ipa
hophead
pleasing
but
good
no
the
less
very
drinkable
pils
but
expensive
and
not
overly
impressive
o
i
did
enjoy
the
klisch
from
lakefront
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
not
overly
complex
and
straight
forward
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
rather
disappointing
a
bit
too
sweet
the
hops
add
very
little
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
all

so
i
therefore
tentatively
recommend
trying
this
one
if
you
are
curious
about
what
the
two
styles
of
pilsner
would
taste
like
blended
together
its
weird
but
weirdness
does
not
necessarily
equal
badness
in
this
case
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
never
got
any
distinguishing
traits
to
set
itself
apart
quite
enjoyable
with
good
hop
flavor
d
sessionable
and
uniquely
tasty
this
is
a
delicious
example
of
the
style
really
decent
you
can
tell
that
this
beer
has
the
right
intentions
good
all
grain
malt
but
the
ohsoimportant
saaz
hop
component
if
that
is
what
they
used
here
the
label
doesnt
say
falls
flat
not
bad
as
a
belt
em
back
beer
but
still
a
flabby
interpretation
of
a
specific
and
unforgiving
style
which
is
weird
as
given
the
demographics
of
this
offerings
point
of
origin
one
might
assume
theyd
go
the
german
route
i
think
this
was
my
least
favorite
in
a
pretty
disappointing
mixed
pack
from
lakefront
not
a
bad
pils
with
quite
a
dry
hoppy
finish
which
sets
it
apart
from
many
craft
lagers
which
tend
to
be
sweeter
not
on
the
same
level
as
prima
pils
but
decent
enough
to
drink
when
the
weather
gets
warm
much
prefer
the
stein
beer
as
a
lager
from
these
guys
here
is
an
average
nondescript
craft
beer
in
every
way
possible
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
smell
was
subtle
grain
and
malt
taste
was
mildly
nutbiscuit
and
grains
light
bittering
hops
watery
mouthfeel
and
crisp
carbonation
it
is
what
it
is
but
it
beats
a
macro
quite
limited
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
would
be
a
nice
quaffable
beer
in
the
warm
summer
months
if
nothing
else
is
around
o
a
nice
brew
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
id
pour
another
this
brew
is
pretty
nice
looking
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
color
crested
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
retain
pretty
well
huge
carbonation
is
apparent
lacing
and
retention
are
both
actually
quite
good
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
absolutely
huge
on
zesty
noble
hops
with
pale
malts
and
some
wheatiness
backing
it
up
the
taste
is
a
bit
lacking
it
comes
on
fairly
strong
with
some
nice
noble
hops
over
some
subtle
malts
but
the
finish
brings
in
strongly
astringent
citrus
and
something
that
just
tastes
a
little
bit
sour
its
close
but
not
quite
its
basically
lacking
the
great
balance
thats
the
hallmark
of
a
good
pilsner
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thicker
than
the
average
pilsner
and
highly
carbonated
the
drinkability
suffers
a
lot
due
to
the
poor
aftertaste
and
relative
thickness
overall
this
was
just
barely
an
alright
pilsner
ive
had
a
host
of
better
ones
o
a
light
refreshing
yet
flavorful
beer
considering
the
other
reviews
i
wonder
if
my
bottle
was
mislabeled
overall
very
bland
pilsner
to
me
to
sweet
not
enough
carbonation
and
hop
bitterness
to
make
it
refereshing
what
better
way
to
celebrate
the
obtaining
of
new
beer
half
acres
new
barleywine
to
be
vaguely
precise
than
by
drinking
another
yeah
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
stark
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
mild
chalk
sweet
flowers
and
a
light
touch
of
banana
peel
the
taste
follows
this
recipe
pretty
closely
but
then
brings
in
some
light
corn
hard
water
and
light
orange
rind
things
were
going
so
well
too
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
id
basically
classify
this
as
a
pils
that
was
almost
good
had
the
taste
not
flickered
out
on
me
idve
enjoyed
this
brew
d
for
the
style
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
super
easy
drinkability
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
easily
because
it
doesnt
exhibit
a
lot
of
bitterness
or
dryness
this
german
pilsner
pours
a
light
yellowish
color
as
the
scent
of
malts
hover
ove
rthe
beer
upon
tasting
you
take
in
a
good
taste
of
malts
with
hint
of
lemon
citrus
not
anything
to
rave
about
but
not
terrible
either
very
smooth
soft
and
tasty
pilsner
not
complex
or
bold
but
given
that
has
a
particularly
appealing
and
refreshing
finish
lacks
the
dryness
and
bite
of
a
typical
pilsner
but
i
ignored
this
while
rating
and
enjoying
this
brew
the
taste
is
pretty
mild
with
a
fairlycreamy
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
of
light
carbonation
taste
has
a
very
mild
metallic
astringency
as
well
as
a
bit
of
light
grain
and
husks
subtle
bready
character
and
a
bit
of
pear
body
is
quite
light
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
special
about
it
thanks
again
andy
more
helles
than
pils
and
either
way
a
let
down
im
spoiled
by
the
quality
pils
brewed
in
nj
and
pa
overall
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
a
great
alternative
and
a
good
candidate
to
serve
to
those
fussy
and
stubborn
macrolovers
as
some
other
reviews
have
mentioned
this
isnt
actually
half
bad
when
taken
maybe
as
a
couple
of
other
styles
but
as
pils
this
one
just
falls
short
on
a
hot
day
though
this
would
still
do
in
a
pinch
the
color
is
good
amber
color
its
a
little
cloudy
and
orange
for
a
pilsner
the
nose
is
malty
and
not
so
much
of
the
hops
to
be
aware
of
has
a
rice
like
taste
with
a
malty
after
taste
seems
to
be
made
of
extracts
to
me
as
well
its
a
decent
body
for
a
pilsner
and
is
enjoyable
i
would
want
to
drink
an
entire
6pack
in
one
sitting
definitely
missing
the
dry
bitterness
of
a
pilsner
so
far
ive
been
fairly
impressed
with
lakefront
the
ipa
and
dark
lager
were
better
than
expected
but
the
pilsner
doesnt
come
close
to
hitting
the
mark
all
in
all
this
was
a
mediocre
pilsner
at
best
free
association
golden

with

d
extremely
quaffable

on

d
again
drink
ability
is
average
due
to
the
only
case
of
this
beer
found
was
well
over
a
year
old
yet
drinkable
would
probably
pass
by
it
in
a
singles
shop
definately
not
a
prototypical
pilsner
but
as
a
cold
fermented
blonde
ale
the
beer
shows
promise
the
vegetable
butter
and
apple
notes
can
be
contributed
to
yeast
health
but
it
gives
the
beer
a
unique
identity
its
a
mild
refreshing
pils
pretty
basic
wellbalanced
has
a
dryish
touch
d
this
is
not
my
type
of
beer
so
i
am
probably
overly
critical
pretty
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
try
to
have
again
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
leaving
me
ready
for
more
far
surpasses
other
american
brewed
pilsners
in
its
fuller
body
overall
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
not
something
i
would
pick
up
again
but
pilsner
lovers
would
d
id
only
have
one
of
these
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out

color
with
more
than
a

of

a
fair
amount

just
a

decent
amount
of
carb
and
medium

feel
tasting
just
a
bit

the

flirts

a

opt

side
i
expected

to
keep
you
interested
pours
a

clear
but
with
the
faintest
haze
nice
carbonation
with
a
good
solid
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
pleasantly
crisp
with
that
sweet
honeyish
malt
character
of
a
good
pilsener
and
a
faint
hint
of
noble
hops
the
flavor
is
somewhat
thinner
than
the
aroma
but
still
malty
and
sweet
with
a
crisp
finish
and
a
surprising
bitter
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
one
thing
that
keeps
it
from
breaking
into
the
outstanding
ranks
occupied
by
american
pilsener
standouts
such
as
victory
troegs
sly
fox
and
a
few
others
is
the
hop
flavor
the
hop
bitterness
is
nice
but
the
hop
flavor
is
a
bit
thin
and
slight
a
little
more
complexity
a
little
more
ambition
on
the
hop
schedule
would
elevate
this
from
a
good
beer
to
a
great
one
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
good
amount
of
rising
carbonation
the
onefinger
snowwhite
head
retained
fairly
well
but
the
lacing
was
thin
the
aroma
was
of
floral
hops
sweet
malt
wheat
and
hints
of
wildflowers
and
citrus
very
appealing
the
flavors
were
crisp
and
very
dry
with
distinct
citrus
hops
there
was
a
twang
from
the
wheat
understated
pilsner
malt
and
an
unusual
bitterness
especially
on
the
finish
that
threw
it
off

probably
drink
a

of
these
and

just
not

this
is
a
solid
pilsner
not

bitter
goes
well
with
everything
doesnt
necessarily
stand
out
but
certainly
a
good
drink
crisp
and
cleanvery
much
reflects
the
flavor
i
expect
from
a
true
german
pilsener
the
body
is
middleoftheroad
but
the
carbonation
was
very
highclose
to
the
level
of
soda
the
taste
is
a
light
but
very
nice
golden
lager
smooth
and
clean
yet
tasty
with
apple
hints
of
grain
grass
and
pine
the
grain
becomes
more
promiment
in

finish
it
is
lightly
sweet

bitter
it
becomes
slightly
more
bland
and
mineralwater
like
near
the
end
but
still
retains
decent
flavour
and
body
d
a
good
beer
id
say
a
kolschy
pilsner
due
to
the
name
it
seems
like
a
hybrid
of
the
2
styles
certainly
worth
a
shot
not
amazed
but
a
good
beer
from
lakefront
average
drinkable
session
beer
a
little
sweeter

try

overall
unique
pilsener
and
a
great
find
drinkability
is
moderate

high
this
one
is
certainly
sessionable
its
downfall
is
just
that
its
not
only
basic
pils
but
a
poor
example
of
a
pils
not
great
very
drinkable
and
refreshing

the

this
has
quite
a

i
dont

in

strangly

the

balance
this
offering
is
uniquebut
seems
to
miss
the
markstill

its
good
for

my
taste
could
drink
a
few
here
and
there
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
good
session
definitely
something
i
would
try
again
if
youre
feeling
like
a
pilsner
this
ones
a
great
choice
d
while
i
might
prefer
other
pilsners
this
is
obviously
very
drinkable
and
would
never
pass
one
up
excellent

drinking
d
this
one
is
easily
drinkable
as
any
light
lager
should
be
but
it
is
hardly
inspiring
the
hop
character
is
sadly
lacking
and
the
finish
is
far
too
sweet
not
a
terrible
beer
but
a
poor
excuse
for
a
pils
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
straw
with

it
smelled
like
lemon
and
cultured

with

it

as
it
smelled
like
lemon
hops
and
cultured
yeast
it
was
a
somewhat
bitter
and
fairly
clean
taste
it
was
mostly
watery
with
a
little
carbonation
and
a
mild
lemon
aftertaste
overall
this
was
pretty
good
for
a
pilsner
but
not
my
style
drinkability
when
you
cant
find
a
kölsch
reach
for
a
klisch
then
go
back
to
looking
for
that
kölsch
eric
poured
out
of
the
bottle
a
golden
almost
straw
colored
beer
has
cloudy
appearance
and
herbal
hop
aroma
a
lot
of
carbonation
with
a
lot
of
foam
it
isnt
assertively
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
but
has
pleasant
herbal
hop
flavor
not
too
much
bitterness
very
smooth
fresh
malt
backbone
making
for
a
nice
smooth
mediumbodied
beer
drinkability
is
okay
i
got
the
beer
as
part
of
a
variety
8pack
it
beats
water
but
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
it
out
in
the
future
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
the
fullness
of
the
malt
seems
to
authenticate
this
pils
but
the
misplaced
sweetness
detracts
either
way
good
drinkability
d
not
impressed
anyway
as
a
pilsner
its
crap
but
its
still
very
drinkable
if
youre
not
thinking
about
how
far
it
misses
the
style
mark
i
could
do
it
again
this
is
almost
a
session
brew
id
have
to
take
a
stab
at
a
sixer
and
see
what
happens
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
light
lager
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
mild
flavors
and
a
smooth
profile
cheers
a
very
well
done
beer
with
perfect
drinkability

in

with
the
other

ive
had
of
the

im
on
the
fence
about
some
esters
present
in
the
beer
somewhat
indistinct
yet
almost
yeasty
in
a

seemingly
uncharacteristic
they
add

klisch
pilsner
beer
pours
a
pale
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
a
little
on
the
sour
side
and
not
at
all
what
i
would
expect
from
a
pils
theres
some
hops
and
some
malt
but
not
well
balanced
and
i
think
i
taste
diacetyl
mediocre
at
best
basic
good
session
brew
this
beer
just
screams
average
crisp
and
a
little
tangy
wellcarbonated
mouthfeel
and
while
its
definitely
nothing
special
its
not
offensive
either
pretty
bland
unmemorable
lawnmower
beer
no
more
or
no
less
poured
a
hazy
deepgold
beneath
a
shortlived
head
of
white
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
quickly
rising
from
beneath
the
moderate
gently
crisp
carbonation
becomes
airy
or
cottony
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
combining
with
the
medium
body
to
leave
it
creamy
smooth
across
the
palate
the
flavor
offers
a
healthy
dose
of
grainy
malt
infused
with
grassy
hops
and
livened
by
a
thread
of
yeasty
fruitiness
a
firm
bitterness
lies
beneath
revealing
itself
at
midpalate
and
then
fading
fairly
readily
in
the
finish
leaving
behind
a
dull
acrid
note
amidst
some
fading
lightlyhoneyish
malt
while
not
exactly
a
pilsner
and
more
of
an
american
blonde
klisch
pilsner
offers
more
in
both
the
malt
and
hop
category
while
still
remaining
very
accessible
prost
never
had
a
lakefront
product
before
but
i
picked
up
a
random
8
pack
so
ill
be
trying
at
least
seven
more
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
light
straw
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
a
thin
white
head
composed
of
many
fine
bubbles
the
smell
is
primarily
of
grainy
malt
and
has
a
very
slight
scent
of
hops
the
taste
is
well
balanced
with
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
and
has
a
corn
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
foamy
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
quite
average
this
is
everything
an
american
pilsener
should
be
klisch
pilsner
named
after
our
president
and
founding
father
russ
klisch
is
not
very
good
sorry
to
say
lakefront
has
always
been
hitandmiss
with
me
and
this
offering
is
fairly
wide
of
the
mark
there
are
any
number
of
wisconsinbrewed
pilseners
that
beat
it
like
a
drum
odd
flavor
profile
here
sweet
corn
with
lots
of
fruity
esters
some
tarty
flavors
and
a
floral
hop
bite
malt
seems
to
dominate
the
base
but
the
hop
flavors
really
come
out
sharply
in
the
end
im
left
thinking
about
the
hops
but
they
just
dont
really
fit
with
the
malty
body
i
guess
this
is
all
malt
but
it
seems
a
bit
adjuncty
finish
doesnt
quite
have
the
bite
i
want
but
leaves
a
slightly
dry
bitter
flavor
that
makes
me
want
to
take
another
sip
decent
different
i
dont
know
if
id
want
it
again
hello
fruity
dendron
ive
been
harping
on
and
against
lakefront
for
putting
out
generic
corporate
beers
at
times
but
this
one
is
a
bit
brilliant
sweet
and
potent
and
nothing
bland
about
it
no
aftertaste
or
spasms
in
my
throat
from
this
caffeine
of
candies
i
generally
dislike
the
amber
brews
but
this
one
feeds
me
heartily
my
daily
dose
of
sweet
and
moxie
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
with
a
festive
mud
companion
this
one
more
than
makes
it
a
happy
match
of
spirits
taste
pretty
oddball
sweet
even
for
a
pils
but
that
is
what
made
this
beer
such
a
standout
beer
the
noraml
natural
earthy
pop
but
a
bittersweet
tartness
that
i
can
only
describe
with
vagueries
a
refreshing
yet
oddly
sweet
pilsner
pours
out
to
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
head
of
foam
of
about
14
inch
that
remained
consistant
vigorus
carbonation
some
lace
aromas
were
slightly
sour
with
notes
of
hops
and
sweet
herbal
malt
taste
was
middle
of
the
road
and
not
very
pilsnerish
in
my
opinion
sweet
malt
and
hops
laced
with
tender
grain
and
herbal
grassiness
if
it
werent
so
sweet
it
would
be
more
of
a
pilsner
to
me
mouthfeel
was
refreshing
yet
unremarkable
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nothing
wonderful
but
a
worthy
offering
this
brew
pours
a
bright
gold
color
with
a
ton
of
visible
carbonation
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
thick
and
dense
the
aroma
is
grassy
and
floral
the
taste
has
the
same
grassy
and
floral
notes
that
the
aroma
has
but
they
are
all
a
little
less
vibrant
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
wth
perfect
carbonation
overall
i
havent
enjoyed
a
pilsener
as
much
as
this
in
a
long
time
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
a
beer
needing
a
good
hop
malt
reattack
very
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
or
craft
crossover
fairly
simple
not
too
strong
but
still
tasty
slightly
hazed
gold
color
small
white
head
about
18
of
solido
foam
on
top
of
the
beer
smells
grassy
and
malty
but
also
has
hints
of
crisp
citrus
taste
is
also
crisp
and
clean
hops
are
perceptable
and
good
malt
is
strong
and
slightly
grassy
citrus
in
the
flavor
also
a
good
easily
sessionable
pilsner
better
than
some
of
the
other
offerings
from
lakefront
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
a
bright
gold
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
pils
malt
with
spicy
german
hops
and
some
pleasant
citrus
the
aroma
brings
to
mind
victorys
prima
pils
the
flavor
starts
off
well
a
slightly
sweet
malty
flavor
but
it
just
gets
sweeter
this
beer
is
much
too
sweet
and
has
a
weird
herbal
flavor
the
citrus
flavor
is
nice
but
thats
about
all
this
beer
could
definitely
use
some
more
hop
bitterness
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
definitely
darker
than
an
average
pils
very
little
head
but
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
hoppy
definitely
pleasant
the
taste
was
also
sweeter
than
average
with
plenty
of
caramel
maltiness
and
even
a
bit
of
fruity
character
herbal
hop
bitterness
comes
in
to
last
through
the
finish
with
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
super
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
i
didnt
really
have
high
hopes
but
this
beer
was
a
really
pleasant
surprise
if
you
like
sam
adams
boston
lager
then
youll
likely
enjoy
klisch
as
well
reviewing
this
simultaneously
with
schell
pilsner
i
havent
ever
had
a
pilsner
that
really
interested
me
or
stood
out
but
this
came
the
closest
nothing
really
exciting
in
the
appearance
smell
is
slightly
above
average
with
some
sweetness
maybe
apples
it
has
a
distinct
flavor
grainy
and
sweet
deceivingly
simple
it
tastes
natural
finishes
with
a
nice
little
bitter
kick
klisch
blows
schell
away
this
came
as
part
of
a
beer
of
the
month
sampler
my
first
one
i
poured
this
pale
gold
brew
into
a
pint
glass
with
little
head
and
slight
lacing
its
aroma
was
a
fairly
impressive
combination
of
quince
and
banana
it
tasted
a
little
sweet
for
a
pilsner
but
it
had
a
crisp
hoppy
edge
to
it
nice
it
finishes
slightly
dry
but
not
over
the
top
very
nice
in
conclusion
i
might
keep
a
few
of
these
on
hand
if
they
were
available
locally
this
may
be
the
first
truly
decent
pilsener
by
an
american
brewer
i
have
samplred
it
poured
extremely
pale
with
a
filmy
head
no
lace
the
aroma
is
a
bouquet
of
smeels
hops
apples
and
some
spices
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
come
across
as
surprisingly
crisp
slightly
sweet
but
nicely
balanced
with
the
hops
also
slightly
bitter
and
sulfurous
still
not
sold
on
pilseners
but
this
is
a
fairly
decent
representative
of
the
style
this
is
definately
one
fine
drinking
beer
maybe
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
definately
fridge
worthy
this
doesnt
look
or
smell
like
a
europils
much
closer
to
a
craft
brewed
american
pils
but
the
mouthfeel
is
nailed
and
compares
to
the
fresh
pils
i
had
on
tap
in
europe
this
is
very
refreshing
and
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
very
nice
stuff
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
find
that
the
first
couple
sips
were
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
as
i
drink
more
of
this
beer
it
gets
better
maybe
as
it
gets
warmer
quality
golden
pils
holds
a
varigated
froth
if
poured
hard
minor
nose
carries
hints
of
crackers
and
lawn
jelly
i
like
how
the
liquid
will
attack
the
back
of
your
mouth
initially
then
flow
out
in
all
directions
with
layers
of
toast
and
copper
a
fine
lager
that
would
be
welcome
in
my
fridge
anyday
clear
haygold
in
hue
not
much
animation
it
is
a
lovely
color
though
the
head
was
white
in
color
but
only
about
a
of
an
inch
in
height
not
impressive
plus
the
head
faded
quickly
to
a
weak
fizzy
cap
couple
this
with
a
lack
of
effervesces
and
the
beer
looks
dull
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
another
strike
against
it
the
nose
is
crisply
malty
with
a
lemony
and
butter
twang
potency
is
small
the
beer
doesnt
say
much
anyway
i
dont
care
for
the
nose
too
acidic
oddly
sweet
with
not
enough
pilsmalt
characteristics
the
aromas
arent
detestable
but
theyre
not
inspiring
either
in
summery
then
the
bouquet
is
par
for
the
course
but
i
fancy
more
not
inviting
then
the
palate
tastes
like
what
the
nose
indicated
thats
too
bad
firm
lemony
acidity
mixed
equally
with
a
buttery
twang
mild
bitterness
in
the
middle
the
finish
is
the
home
of
the
malt
weak
and
not
crisp
or
flavorful
not
biscuity
either
mildly
sweet
there
is
a
slightly
flowery
taste
after
the
swallow
the
palate
overall
isnt
great
but
it
isnt
bad
either
there
is
enough
taste
so
i
cant
call
it
boring
the
flavor
profile
doesnt
jive
with
me
too
buttery
too
sweet
and
too
acidic
some
people
may
like
it
im
not
one
of
them
medium
in
body
mushy
mouthfeel
because
of
the
low
carbonation
this
aspect
of
the
beer
needs
improving
it
is
not
pilslike
as
it
needs
more
zip
and
crispness
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
the
macrolager
crowd
or
after
mowing
the
grass
this
is
nothing
id
buy
again
i
have
little
leeway
when
it
comes
to
pilsners
they
have
to
be
brewed
to
near
perfection
or
ill
think
they
are
too
flawed
and
then
pointless
to
drink
this
one
falls
into
the
latter
category
it
was
purchased
as
part
of
a
samplerpack
in
milwaukee
wi
straw
yellow
body
with
a
clingy
white
head
not
overly
impressive
looking
smells
of
clean
light
fruit
malt
and
sulfurous
spicy
hops
taste
is
a
nice
surprise
light
fruity
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
surprisingly
big
hops
bitter
with
a
peppery
spiciness
light
crisp
refreshing
feel
and
quite
drinkable
a
little
watery
upfront
but
develops
very
well
malts
are
doughy
and
sweet
but
overtaken
by
the
assertive
hop
bittering
cleans
out
and
leaves
a
nice
long
bitter
finish
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
so
i
probably
wont
revisit
this
but
do
recommend
it
to
those
so
inclined
slight
hazed
dusty
gold
color
tall
frothy
white

distinguishes
to
a
skimming

the

sticks
in
some

is
about
medium
with
a
lighter
carbonation
yet
crisp
and
semibold
dryish
finish
with
some
sticky
sweetness
residuals
leftover
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
a
nice
drinker
from
the
folks
at
lakefront
pours
a
rich
golden
colour
maybe
a
pinch
darker
than
most
pilsners
the
nose
was
light
and
mildy
floral
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
was
fairly
light
and
mild
with
minimal
hoppiness
and
some
grainy
notes
down
the
middle
again
a
hint
of
citrus
fruit
which
was
a
little
different
for
a
pils
overall
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
but
not
really
a
top
choice
in
terms
of
a
pilsner
darker
than
gold
clear
as
a
bell
appearance
pale
head
is
down
to
a
spidery
skin
in
20
seconds
in
contrast
it
laces
well
in
broad
dripping
rings
aroma
is
very
sweet
almost
seems
like
it
has
estery
qualities
with
marshmallow
characteristics
the
flavor
follows
suit
sweet
and
cotton
candy
in
tone
just
a
lightish
bit
of
lemon
and
an
earlyasserting
but
fairly
weak
peppery
hop
balance
mouthfeel
is
close
to
medium
and
seems
fairly
flattish
could
be
less
sweet
and
fruity
and
more
crisp
and
sharply
attenuated
to
be
a
good
one
for
me
cheers
to
bighuge
for
the
chance
to
sup
this
one
the
smell
brought
in
a
nice
aroma
of
flowery
hallertau
hops
the
initial
taste
was
of
subdued
maltiness
but
with
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
saaz
kind
of
a
light
body
but
thoroughly
refreshing
the
finish
was
good
and
it
beckoned
the
tongue
for
more

a
drinkable
beerdefinitely

a

although
mild

company
the
appearance
is
a
deep
gold
color
with
very
nice
clarity
the
head
was
unimpressive
though
with
a
mere
bit
of
lacing
down
the
side
the
aroma
is
smooth
and
very
clean
the
taste
as
already
noted
but
worth
repeating
is
very
nice
sweet
light
malts
are
the
dominant
taste
with
slight
cracker
like
aftertaste
very
light
hop
taste
as
well
this
is
very
light
in
body
and
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
look
for
this
because
it
will
make
your
day
after
a
hot
afternoon
working
in
the
yard

a
clear
dark
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
fades
fast
aroma
consists
of
spicy

bready

and
a
little
bit
of
yeast
mouthfeel
has
a
nice

and
carbonated
bite
to
it
definitely
some
body
unlike
most
american
pilsners
taste
consists
of
malt
spicy
hops
and
barley
finish
is
sharp
and
has
a
pronounced
bitterness
to
it
from
the
saaz
hops
a
finnicky
style
nowadays
that
can
be
a
difficult
one
to
please
most
people
with
but
lakefront
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
tackling
it
here
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
on
tap
more
so
than
i
can
remember
when
tasting
it
from
a
bottle
poured
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
brewery
this
golden
almost
straw
colored
beer
has
cloudy
appearance
and
herbal
hop
aroma
a
lot
of
carbonation
with
a
lot
of
foam
it
isnt
assertively
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
but
has
pleasant
herbal
hop
flavor
not
too
much
bitterness
very
smooth
fresh
malt
backbone
making
for
a
nice
smooth
mediumbodied
beer
deep
golden
in
color
relatively
clear
but
some
slight
haziness
nose
lends
a
somewhat
skunky
hop
presence
taste
is
maltier
than
expected
aa
good
malt
load
for
this
style
but
it
also
features
a
slightly
skunky
heineken
like
finsih
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
somewhat
slick
and
sweet
finishes
on
a
mild
dry
note
overall
an
ok
pilsner
i
wouldnt
seek
out
the
beer
is
actually
a
little
hazy
not
right
for
a
pilsner
nice
straw
golden
hue
though
and
a
nice
white
frothy
head
really
nice
blend
of
spicy
noble
hops
and
pilsner
malt
on
the
nose
with
an
additional
subtle
perfumeyminty
aroma
theres
a
nice
little
bitter
bite
to
this
beer
i
like
it
theres
a
definite
european
slant
to
this
pilsner
the
taste
really
appeals
to
me
good
pils
malt
base
various
floral
herbal
and
spicy
hop
notes
dance
on
top
of
that
and
a
lingering
bitterness
puts
the
capper
on
this
full
bodied
lager
the
hop
qualities
really
appeal
to
me
in
this
one
another
nice
offering
from
lakefront
very
solid
per
the
style
this
brew
looked
like
most
pilsners
do
it
had
the
typical
yellow
color
white
a
head
it
was
light
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
the
flavor
was
a
little
odd
though
to
me
it
had
a
sour
flavor
similar
to
a
flemish
red
in
my
opinion
i
dont
believe
that
id
ever
seek
this
out
again
i
just
wasnt
a
huge
fan
medium
bodied
with
a
very
light
honey
color
pretty
tasty
pilsner
again
kind
of
watery
subtle
and
balanced
hops
and
another
easy
drinker
d
i
apologize
in
advance
to
my
friends
at
lancaster
but
this
is
not
a
good
beer
barely
any
flavor
no
scent
at
all
and
it
looks
ugly
too
if
youre
going
to
the
brewpub
avoid
this
at
all
costs
unless
youre
a
domestic
light
drinker
and
are
afraid
of
beer
with
flavor
the
hops
are
slightly
spicy
and
the
beer
unfiltered
white
pepper
and
overly
light
body
set
back
the
roundness
and
crispness
of
the
beer
a
touch
sour
and
heavily
carbonated
very
dry
and
oily
unfiltered
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
has
everything
i
like
a
pleasant
smell
a
sweet
flavor
balanced
with
a
moderate
hoppiness
and
decent
carbonation
its
probably
my
favorite
from
lbc
this
beer
is
a
bright
clear
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
and
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
it
had
no
smell
that
were
strong
enough
for
me
to
pick
up
on
other
then
hopscitrus
it
tasted
much
the
same
as
its
smell
with
a
wonderful
hop
bite
to
it
this
was
a
good
clean
pilsner
d
this
is
a
decent
and
drinkable
summer
lager
crisp
and
refreshing
for
hot
days
easy
to
session
and
drink
a
lot
of
not
something
i
will
run
out
and
buy
again
but
something
i
can
easily
drink
a
nice
beer
but
no
czech
pilsener
theres
a
relatively
big
citrus
hops
taste
thats
far
too
american
it
comes
across
similar
to
brooklyn
pilsner
the
citrus
has
more
specific
sweet
grapefruit
undertones
with
pale
grains
lingering
in
the
back
for
the
style
the
malt
was
too
mild
and
the
hops
too
american
but
style
aside
its
not
a
bad
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
with
a
big
foamy
head
must
be
unfiltered
because
there
are
lots
of
yeast
particles
floating
around
which
i
had
to
let
settle
color
and
lack
of
clarity
are
off
for
a
pilsner
good
head
retention
during
that
settling
time
smell
is
big
on
the
hops
taste
is
also
a
bit
hoppier
than
expected
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
also
a
bit
yeasty
relatively
crisp
but
also
somewhat
slick
on
the
tongue
again
odd
for
a
pilsner
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
but
its
weird
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
pilsner
and
so
as
a
pilsner
its
very
mediocre
looks
pretty
good
and
the
nose
is
respectable
with
a
little
biscuity
hop
presence
the
flavor
has
potential
but
is
ultimately
too
watery
and
dull
this
enhances
drinkability
however
creating
a
decent
session
beer
it
would
truly
be
wonderful
if
this
average
brewpub
returned
to
its
once
excellent
former
self
1
49

oz
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
good
although
the
beer
does
confound
at
times
cheers
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
overall
a
nice
brew
to
drink
after
a
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
day
a
fairly
nice
uncomplicated
brew
but
it
still
leaves
me
wanting
a
bit
more
oelergud
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
disappointing
to
a
man
craving
a
crisp
and
spicy
pils
the
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
with
a
soft
fruity
almost
caramel
like
sweetness
to
it
the
finish
has
a
dry
toasted
biscuit
note
to
it
that
intermingles
with
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
the
herbal
hop
note
shines
from
beginning
to
end
it
is
perhaps
the
most
noticeable
flavor
here
and
provides
a
nice
foil
for
the
uncharacteristic
caramel
sweet
malt
notes
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
take
on
a
pilsner
more
of
an
amber
ale
even
it
is
pretty
tasty
though
and
quite
quaffable
on
a
purely
hedonistic
scale
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
it
is
a
far
cry
from
a
pilsner
presented
as
a
deep
golden
color
beverage
with
impressive
white
puffy
head
smell
was
mainly
of
sweetish
hops
and
while
not
overly
enjoyable
was
acceptable
taste
is
pleasant
and
a
nice
maltiness
brings
a
nice
slighty
hoppy
taste
to
the
mouth
finish
is
somewhat
disappointingn
but
a
slight
hoppiness
ginves
some
salvation
all
things
considered
not
a
bad
beer
gold
star
pilsner
isnt
much
of
a
pilsener
but
its
a
damn
fine
beer
its
hoppy
enough
to
get
and
keep
my
attention
from
first
sip
to
last
ive
heard
very
little
about
this
pa
brewery
and
am
now
excited
to
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
i
give
it
a
gold
star
drinking
this
is
easy
and
enjoyable
thank
you
lancaster
for
sharing
your
talent
with
me
overall
great
made
in
usa
pilsner
i
highly
recommend
this
one
pours
unusually
dark
for
a
pilsner
pours
a
hazy
light
copper
colour
with
a
pretty
nice
white
fluffy
head
smell
has
a
bit
of
spice
and
floral
hoppy
snap
to
it
taste
has
just
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
at
the
forefront
before
it
is
jerked
back
like
a
bungi
cord
by
the
hops
the
beer
finishes
crisp
and
clean
as
it
should
mouthfeel
is
sharp
with
nice
fine
carbonation
that
keeps
the
beer
fresh
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
also
good
these
went
down
really
well
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
clear
dark
copperamber
color
the
head
is
thick
almost
a
dirty
white
and
there
is
a
lot
of
lacing
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
scent
is
somewhat
metallic
somewhat
sweet
maltiness
and
a
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
hops
and
they
are
spicy
the
grassy
spicy
hops
flavors
comes
through
kicking
there
is
a
slight
flavor
of
sweet
malts
maybe
some
dark
fruits
overall
very
smooth
very
interesting
blend
of
malts
and
hops
nice
pilsner
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
finger
of
rocky
white
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
is
a
subdued
grass
hay
and
floral
hops
taste
starts
out
with
a
light
malt
sweetness
followed
quickly
by
a
grassy
and
spicey
hop
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
very
soft
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
dryish
finish
this
is
a
pretty
nice
easy
drinking
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
heavier
than
a
pilsner
should
be
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
have
to
bring
the
numbers
down
a
little
because
i
think
they
missed
the
style
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
that
was
purchased
at
the
brewpub
pours
a
burntgolden
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
haze
an
initially
thick
white
head
quickly
falls
but
never
completely
disappears
the
lace
is
decent
crisp
floral
spicy
sharp
hop
aroma
just
a
little
soft
sweetness
is
present
in
the
foretaste
followed
quickly
by
a
poignant
snappy
hop
flavor
the
spicy
hop
character
completes
the
taste
which
finishes
clean
and
abrupt
medium
to
light
in
body
low
carbonation
for
the
style
tasty
and
drinkable
served
up
a
case
to
a
mixed
crowd
on
mothers
day
at
partys
end
this
bottle
was
the
last
in
the
cooler
id
say
that
makes
for
a
good
crossover
beer
lancasters
comeback
really
needs
more
attention
another
fine
pa
brewery
i
really
must
visit
the
brewpub
this
summer
finger
licking
good
decent
pils
brew
i
am
not
really
a
pils
fan
but
i
do
like
this
one
it
is
easy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
grainy
and
bready
tasting
which
is
what
bothers
me
about
a
lot
of
pils
overall
a
crisp
light
nicely
crafted
brew
from
lancaster
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pilsener
from
and
excellent
brewery
it
may
not
be
the
best
pilsener
in
the
world
definitly
not
the
best
smelling
but
its
crisp
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
perfect
for
this
warm
spring
day
notes
though
not
quite
a
five
star
quality
in
every
way
this
would
definitely
be
a
solid
session
brew
drinking
this
makes
me
imagine
myself
out
on
the
grady
white
bobbing
around
doing
my
best
to
catch
all
the
flounder
at
the
jersey
shore
12
ounce
bottle
if
you
told
me
this
was
an
english
bitter
i
could
have
believed
it
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
but
a
bit
off
style
for
a
pils
a
push
toward
noble
hops
would
make
a
difference
if
noble
hops
are
used
they
are
certainly
american
cultivars
a
good
example
of
the
style
though
not
all
that
memorable
this
poured
out
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
fizzy
head
the
left
the
scene
like
it
owed
my
money
shortly
after
the
pour
roasted
grain
is
what
i
first
smelled
though
after
a
while
i
believe
it
smelled
like
hay
there
was
some
roasted
scent
malt
and
a
bit
of
spice
notes
sprinkled
about
over
the
hay
the
flavor
was
a
bit
sweet
with
malts
while
have
a
roasted
grain
character
to
it
as
well
there
were
a
good
amount
of
hops
balancing
it
out
and
lending
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
as
well
mouthfeel
was
about
average
with
no
notable
aspects
standing
out
or
detracting
from
this
brew
with
a
pretty
good
flavor
this
was
definitely
an
easy
drinking
brew
i
could
put
down
a
few
of
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
pilsner
beer
is
good
happy
beering
final
thought
this
has
amber
lager
written
all
over
it
i
dont
consider
this
a
true
pilsener
also
a
little
strong
for
the
style
pours
a
hazed
golden
pils
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
few
surprise
chunks
i
mean
chunks
of
protein
coagulation
bready
and
husky
malt
aroma
pretty
clean
taste
but
somewhat
flawed
for
some
reason
predominantly
malty
and
husky
with
minimal
hops
other
than
a
small
bite
pretty
good
but
not
my
favorite
style
of
pilsener
this
arrived
with
a
great
head
in
evidence
there
was
also
a
good
bit
of
effervesence
in
a
brew
that
was
a
beautiful
goldenyellow
color
it
had
a
light
grassy
grainlike
smell
but
it
was
so
weak
as
to
almost
be
imperceptible
there
was
a
very
light
mouthfeel
but
an
extremely
dry
crisp
finish
there
was
decent
head
retention
throughout
and
the
belgian
lace
that
was
left
behind
was
beautiful
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
of
foam
topping
the
brew
off
the
aroma
has
a
good
balance
of
fruity
sweet
hops
and
musty
malt
the
taste
is
fruity
with
sweet
malts
that
combines
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
some
floral
sweetness
and
caramel
spiciness
comes
through
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
well
blended
not
as
crisp
and
tasty
as
other
pilsners
this
is
actually
more
like
a
golden
fest
beer
more
sweeter
than
i
expected
but
fine
nevertheless
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
boasts
of
pale
malts
and
some
damn
fine
smelling
hops
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
is
pale
and
grainy
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
it
has
no
real
malt
complexity
but
it
still
goes
down
easy
with
a
smooth
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
well
its
a
fine
golden
ale
with
nice
hop
characteristics
notes
certainly
not
the
pilsner
i
was
expecting

is
this
flawed
or
was
it
intentional
cloudy
with
a
stuggling
crispness

this
beer
does
nothing
for
me
not
horrible
but
not
a
beer
id
go
back
to
drinkability

pretty
good
nice
modern
representation
of
style
imho
pours
a
hazy
darker
gold
color
with
a
spotty
surface
head
no
lacing
at
all
through
the

the
aroma
was
nice
as
malt
and
hay
grass
were
quite
noticeable
the
flavor
followed
the
aroma
as
malt
hay
and
reasonable
bitterness
hit
the
tastebuds
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
somewhat
thick
for
a
pilsner
the
carbonation
was
very
light
and
there
was
no
crispness
the
malt
rode
the
tongue
for
several
seconds
after
swallowing
not
overly
exciting
but
better
than
average

i
could
go
through
a

i

was
somewhat
skunked
could
be
an
older
bottle
so
ill
reserve
judgement
on
it
taste
is
pretty
dry
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
with
a
sharp
hop
bite
that
hits
midway
thru
swallow
this
pils
has
some
nice
complexitys
to
it
not
what
you
see
enough
in
the
stylei
only
wish
i
could
try
it
fresh
i
rather
like
this
pilsener
it
really
surprised
me
with
how
good
it
was
could
drink
a
bunch
in
a
row
this
pilsner
poured
a
cloudy
goldencolored
appearance
with
a
decent
frothy
head
rather
slow
but
steady
carbonation
rose
to
the
top
of
the
glass
and
there
was
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
at
the
end
the
smell
was
characteristically
pilsner
with
strong
saaz
hops
floral
notes
and
a
subdued
malty
presence
the
taste
was
very
bitter
with
grassy
elements
mellow
but
crisp
and
sharp
at
the
same
time
it
finished
with
a
somewhat
breadlike
doughy
taste
the
feel
was
prickly
on
the
tongue
paving
the
way
for
the
bitterness
of
the
taste
lancaster
brewing
has
some
good
stuff
and
this
pilsner
is
a
fine
example
crisp
and
refreshingly
bitter
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
recommended
this
is
a
sophisticated
nuanced
soft
and
spicy
pilsner
a
pilsner
to
be
envied
by
brewers
in
plzen
and
to
be
tasted
by
those
who
only
have
been
taken
in
by
the
advertised
true
pilsner
of
miller
brewing
the
pour
is
the
first
clue
that
your
are
about
to
taste
a
fresh
american
pilsner
not
one
that
has
spent
weeks
on
a
ship
in
who
knows
what
condition
the
aroma
is
soft
and
enticing
with
a
wisp
of
grass
and
straw
and
a
subtle
floral
note
no
doubt
from
the
three
types
of
hops
in
the
brew
the
taste
is
mouthfilling
with
a
superb
balance
between
the
slight
toastiness
of
the
ample
malt
and
the
above
mentioned
sophistication
of
the
hopping
process
spicy
pepper
from
the
saaz
and
a
mellow
bitterness
from
the
german
hops
gives
a
refreshing
crisp
note
to
the
mid
palate
finishes
with
some
mouth
coating
maltiness
then
a
final
residual
floral
bitterness
well
done
appearance
pours
with
a
vigorous
volcanically
flowing
white
head
with
chunks
of
yeast
floating
in
a
suspension
from
this
bottled
conditioned
beauty
no
born
on
date
so
something
tells
me
this
one
could
be
a
little
aged
but
either
way
this
one
held
up
nicely
with
a
magnificant
golden
hue
sporting
huge
patches
of
silky
lacing
round
my
conical
shaped
pilsner
glass
did
i
mention
how
amazing
the
retention
of
this
pillow
like
mountainous
head
appears
after
quite
a
challenging
pour
aroma
delicate
light
malt
sweetness
with
an
in
your
face
amount
of
saaz
hops
coming
through
not
a
bad
pils
at
all
very
welcoming
on
a
warm
day
would
like
to
seek
this
one
out
on
draft
taste
a
bready
yet
grassy
character
makes
for
a
crisp
refreshing
pilsner
beer
with
more
than
a
sufficient
balance
of
hops
in
the
bitterness
department
semisimple
yet
a
style
and
beer
here
to
be
enjoyed
by
all
beer
lovers
mouthfeel
lighter
bodied
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
jet
stream
of
carbonation
perfect
fullness
in
the
humid
summer
days
ive
been
living
in
drinkability
a
wonderful
session
brew
not
to
challenging
except
for
the
pouring
but
to
the
taste
buds
a
great
escape
of
simple
enjoyment
in
a
botlle
i
could
easily
put
away
a
sixer
without
thinking
about
it
very
nice
brew
i
was
after
christian
to
make
a
pils
from
the
day
lancaster
malt
brewing
opened
i
mean
when
the
brewers
name
is
heim
and
its
in
lancaster
pa
youd
think
it
was
a
no
brainer
well
it
was
about
three
years
before
they
rolled
this
beer
out
and
it
has
become
my
favorite
of
the
year
round
items
they
make
its
a
little
on
the
toasty
side
but
with
a
very
nice
malthops
tension
its
actually
the
hoppiest
beer
they
make
it
wasnt
called
lancaster
malt
for
nothin
which
suits
me
fine
it
would
probably
look
better
in
a
pilsner
glass
and
when
i
take
the
occaisional
jug
home
thats
what
i
use
gold
star
is
one
of
the
reasons
east

the

a
clear
deep
golden
body
that
releases
tiny
slow
moving
bubbles
upward
towards
its
frothy
white
head
its
retention
is
limited
but
it
maintains
a
thin
creamy
surface
covering
throughout
most
of
the
glass
and
leaves
some
spotty
lace
the
nose
expresses
bright
floral
and
grassy
hops
as
well
as
some
background
maltiness
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
but
its
enhanced
by
a
very
fine
carbonation
that
gently
caresses
the
tongue
before
sliding
across
the
palate
an
unimposing
lightly
grainy
malt
acts
as
a
base
for
loads
of
fresh
floral
and
spicy
hop
flavor
and
a
bold
bitterness
at

ibus
wellbalanced
and
quite
impressive
in
its
bitterness
level
theyre
obviously
not
trying
for
a
crossover
beer
with
this
one
its
clearly
within
the
range
of
the
north
german
style
it
finishes
with
some
hop
flavor
upfront
followed
by
a
dollop
of
lightly
sweet
grainy
malt
and
then
some
more
swirling
hop
flavors

a
bonedry

it
was
ok
not
the
best
six

from
711
in

in

this
stuff
even
looks
cheap
in

the
coarse
bubbles
peter
out
quickly
sort
of
sweet
and
grainy
not
even
refreshing
though
if
you
were
seriously
sweating
and
gasping
from
thirst
it
would
be
welcome
enough
but
rated
as
a
czech
pilsener
its
laughable
from
the
12
oz
bottle
with
the
longest
neck
i
have
ever
seen
not
a
fan
of
pilsners
but
it
is
what
it
is
not
bad
but
not
good
either
i
thought
it
tasted
like
egg
yolk
with
a
very
weird
taste
and
smell
ill
just
finish
my
six
pack
and
never
buy
this
again
i
had
it
in
mexico
so
i
cant
tell
whether
i
was
just
on
a
mexico
high
or
it
was
so
hot
that
this
tasted
better
than
it
probably
actually
was
i
enjoyed
this
czech
pils
i
would
grade
it
higher
than
most
mexican
imports
it
compliments
the
majority
of
a
mexican
menu
im
seriously
surprised
by
this
beer
strong
crisp
mouthfeel
no
skunkyness
that
one
might
associate
with
a
typical
mexican
beer
in
fact
this
beer
is
totally
atypical
when
compared
to
other
mexican
brews
im
a
huge
fan
of
sessionable
pilsners
and
this
one
is
distinctive
and
absolutely
drinkable
a
solid
beer
all
around

packaged
in
a
custom
enameled
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
served
in

is

curious

dark
yellow

faint
brown
no

though
even
when
pouring
fast
the
smell
nose
is
oakiness
which
is
odd
a
roasted
butterscotch
also
in
the
mix
like
most
mexican
beers
a
doughy
yeast
comes
on
strong
after
swirling
mediumlight
sweet
mediumlight
bitter
mediumlight
sour
taste
lots
of

maltose
however
its
not
overpowering
a
sprinkle
of
nuttiness
and
a
bit
of
pizza
dough
mouthfeel
quenchable
to
the
thirst
overall
slighty
better
than
your
average
mexican
beer
not
impressed
whatever
this
beer
is
i
dont
think
its
very
good
minimal
flavor
and
whats
there
isnt
great
in
general
this
is
simply
an
undercooked
pilsner
not
that
im
claiming
it
should
be
off
the
spectrum
it
is
much
better
tasting
than
its
cousin
pacifico
but
it
showcases
its
alcohol
proudly
where
quality
beers
are
more
subtle
not
a
good
beer
but
slightly
better
than
the
competition
in
terms
of
mexican
pale
lagers
not
genuine
pilsners
overall
ugh
avoid
if
at
all
possible
o
not
the
best
mexican
beer
but
better
than
many
would
drink
this
over
coronasol
everday
of
the
week
perhaps
ive
been
in
mexico
too
long
and
now
see
corn
everywhere
but
i
am
convinced
this
is
an
adjunct
fine
if
one
is
looking
for
volume
cold
corona
for
my
palate
just
a
light
adjunct
lager

this

i
am
going

have
to

no

would
i
like
try
more
beers
from
this
brewery
absolutely
yes
without

pours
a
clear
yelloworange
with
a
foamy
bone

that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on

of
the
beer
small
dots
of

form
around
the

on

taste
is
much
the

citrus

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of

bitterness
on
the

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty

pretty

one

ive

and
something
you
just
want
to
gulp
down
funny
story
is
that
it
took
me
ages
to
finally
get
the
appeal
of
this
beer
even
in
midst
of
all
the
hype
after
cleansing
my
palate
with
a
variety
of
gentler
beers
after
knocking
it
out
with
far
stronger
offerings
in
the
past
year
my
rediscovery
of
this
beer
came
to
me
as
a
tremendous
surprise
i
always
make
a
question
to
order
either
this
or
trumer
pils
whenever
im
in
a
bar
that
offers
them
in
berkeley
it
keeps
things
simple
and
yet
shows
the
vibrant
qualities
that
a
homemade
lager
can
bring
to
the
table
seek
it
my
children
seek
it
well
and
good
theres
a
piney
bitterness
with
a
robust
biscuit
finish
on
it
another
tasty
moonlight
brew
i
like
this
beer
but
i
think
id
reach
for
a
death
and
taxes
instead
because
its
slightly
sweet
for
me
o
solid
overall
great
balance
foundation
and
separation
of
constituent
parts
tastes
like
a
czech
pils
more
than
anything
else
probably
oughta
do
a
followup
review
asap
this
is
kind
of
the
ideal
lager
sort
of
beer
reminds
me
of
the
way
mexican
beers
used
to
taste
in
the
1960s
at
least
in
my
mind
on
tap
at
the
trappist
in
oakland
and
a
great
quaff
for
lunch
i
have
tasted
very
few
high
quality
pils
this
one
blew
me
away
it
was
refreshing
light
and
full
of
good
pils
flavor
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
this
on
tap
at
toronado
with
a
good
friend
who
was
showing
me
the
local
brew
scene
i
wont
forget
it
and
would
highly
recommend
you
try
it
on
tap
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
hay

quite
earthy
with
bread
and
biscuit
and
a
bit
of

the
taste
is
dry

the
finish
is
drying
with
a
very
light
bitterness
and
a
lingering
earthiness
medium

mediumlight
body
a
great
american
pilsener
drink
much
like
bombay
was
hearing
the
hype
but
couldnt
believe
how
good
this
was
sad
i
only
had
one
pint
beers
like
this
show
why
the
american
brewing
scene
is
now
king
and
will
be
so
for
a
very
long
time
overall
im
not
a
lager
fan
but
so
many
pilseners
are
awful
this
is
an
exception
when
its
good
its
very
good
o
a
great
pilsner
its
light
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
but
still
has
loads
of
flavor
i
dont
drink
a
ton
of
lagers
but
this
is
easily
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
had

all
but
allow
me
to
fulfill
the
stereotype
and
just
say
that
theres
easily
one
hundred
ales
id
rather
have
than
this
beer
a
good
beer
though
and
something
worth
looking
for
and
seeking
out
if
youre
a
lager
guy
or
girl
md
mediumbodied
plenty
of
carbonation
and
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
enjoy
the
style
im
not
a
big
fan
of
pilsners
in
general
but
ive
gotta
tip
my
hat
to
moonlight
for
brewing
the
best
interpretation
of
the
style
ive
ever
tasted
good
pils
that
rivals
my
favorite
prima
pils
all
of
the
good
flavors
in
a
nice
balance
o
like
prima
pils
only
better
i
see
this
as
a
a
prime
example
of
what
the
style
should
looked
and
taste
like
similar
flavors
very
crisp
dry
and
refreshing
with
a
lingering
bitterness
from
the
ample
noble
hops
light
bready
flavors
of
crisp
crackers
and
sliced
apple
again
so
crisp
and
clean
with
enough
hops
to
keep
interest
superbly
balanced
with
equal
malt
and
yeast
character
extremely
versatile
a
timeless
classic
to
pair
with
just
about
anything
a
nice
fullbodied
taste
for
a
lager
i
noticed
very
slight
herb
notes
a
very
appealing
goldenbrown
appearence
very
smooth
but
thick
mouthfeel
it
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
not
an
overpowering
nose
but
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
i
will
definitely
look
forward
to
trying
this
beer
in
the
future
overall
not
bad
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
i
was
expecting
just
a
little
bit
more
ill
revisited
again
though
notes
really
nice
pilsener
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
in
it
quite
refreshing
and
crisp
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
but
overall
it
is
fairly
well
balanced
o
delicious
and
this
not
a
style
i
ususally
go
for
overall
pilsener
at
perfection
o
this
packs
in
the
flavor
for
the
abv
you
cant
ask
for
much
more
aroma
and
flavor
are
on
for
style
and
just
really
work
well
would
be
happy
drinking
this
every
day
during
the
summer
o
there
is
a
reason
this
is
listed
as
the
best
czech
pilsener
i
love
this
beer
and
along
with
death
and
taxes
order
it
pretty
much
whenever
i
see
it
a
very
good
czech
pilsner
with
good
flavour
and
balance
after
a
long
flight
it
was
great
to
grab
a
ccouple
of
these
on
tap
while
i
had
a
snack
a
very
nice
czech
pils
d
super
drinkable
this
has
set
the
new
bar
for
pilsners
in
my
mind
the
balance
here
is
fantastic
and
all
of
the
flavors
really
build
on
each
other
to
create
an
excellent
beer
overall
a
very
well
done
lager
this
could
gain
gratefully
with
the
addition
of
a
few
more
spicy
grassy
hops
but
very
well
done
throughout
nonetheless
while
it
may
be
the
best
pilsner
brewed
this
side
of
the
atlantic
or
should
i
say
pacific
i
think
part
of
the
acclaim
it
receives
stems
from
the
unfortunate
fact
that
this
clean
agreeable
yet
uncompromising
kind
of
pilsner
is
so
often
dishonored
and
dishonored
so
badly
that
many
overlook
the
fact
that
this
hoppy
but
easy
beer
is
just
simply
what
a
pilsner
is
da
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
regular
access
to
however
i
dont
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
with
this
beer
as
ive
had
other
czech
pilseners
that
were
equal
or
better
than
this
one

d
i
never
thought
id
want
a
lighter
less
filling
body
on
a
pilsner
but
apparently
thats
what
i
want
good
taste
and
overall
good
beer
though
o
this
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
i
have
to
say
its
a
great
refreshing
summery
beer
but
with
a
little
more
complexity
than
your
runofthemill
pilsner
i
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
this
because
id
drink
it
all
summer
long
edit
had
to
get
a
keg
of
this
for
my
wedding
everyone
loved
it
and
so
did
i
one
of
the
best
pilsners
on
the
market
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
of
the
style
i
found
it
very
flavorful
and
balanced
it
wasnt
a
beer
that
blew
me
away
with
flavors
but
it
was
probably
the
best
version
of
the
style
ive
had
very
solid
beer
overall
easy
drinking
as
well
as
flavorful
rating
with
style
in
mind
definitely
gives
this
one
a
little
boost
in
my
scores
since
as
i
said
its
probably
the
best
of
the
style
i
can
remember
having
light
and
drinkable
but
also
very
standard
and
rather
uninspiring
its
fair
to
say
i
was
deeply
disappointed
with
this
beer
being
nothing
more
than
a
middleoftheroad
pils
as
far
as
im
concerned
new
zealand
has
the
jump
on
this
style
nowadayscroucher
and
emersons
far
outstrip
this
one
this
might
replace
death
taxes
as
my
favorite
moonlight
beer
full
of
flavor
without
needing
higher
abv
to
accomplish
it
overalldrinkability
great
session
beer
was
our
first
beer
for
the
night
thanks
to
sean
and
the
chicago
crew
for
saving
me
some
from
last
nights
tasting
growler
opened
up
with
a
nice
hiss
a
great
sign
that
its
still
fresh
light
bright
golden
color
with
nice
carbonation
and
minimal
lacing
floral
grainy
and
hay
like
aromas
so
much
better
than
any
of
the
czech
pilseners
ive
had
taste
is
very
flavorful
for
the
style
getting
some
floral
and
slight
citrus
notes
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
they
are
getting
everything
out
this
style
that
definitely
lives
up
to
its
top
rating
what
a
great
beer
to
be
able
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
love
try
this
again
fresh
off
the
tap
definitely
a
recommend
o
best
pilsner
ive
had
not
to
say
id
seek
it
out
from
some
of
my
regular
offerings
but
its
quite
good
and
easy
to
drink
d
very
very
solid
and
lived
up
to
the
high
expectations
that
i
set
for
it
would
have
again
over
and
over
musttry
great
for
the
style
but
not
an
elite
beer
really
glad
i
got
to
tick
it
this
one
really
set
the
stage
for
drunken
stumbling
out
of
toronado
which
i
think
is
just
about
right
when
you
only
get
to
go
there
once
on
a
vacation
overall
delicious
and
amazingly
drinkable
a
rare
treat
perhaps
not
as
balanced
as
it
could
be
and
although
quite
tasty
it
leaves
me
thinking
about
what
i
will
try
next
perhaps
that
is
the
peril
of
being
included
on
such
an
awesome
tap
list
as
the
monks
kettle
has
beer
is
light
in
body
and
served
way
too
damn
cold
imo
i
wait
and
warm
it
up
a
little
but
get
impatient
shame
on
you
flavor
shame
beer
is
mildly
sweet
up
front
and
has
moderate
carbonation
on
the
palate
and
finishes
cleanly
without
being
too
dry
this
was
a
high
quality
dong
tick
for
me
and
while
i
really
appreciate
the
simplicity
of
this
beer
and
it
is
done
well
i
cant
think
of
anything
that
makes
it
special
its
not
bittered
its
just
a
classic
example
of
the
style
it
embodies
what
a
czech
pils
is
about
id
have
it
again
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
solid
all
around
overall
a
superior
pils
finally
a
pilsener
that
i
can
actually
drink
taste
is
similar
but
i
pick
up
a
twinge
of
floral
hops
there
too
extremely
crisp
and
refreshing
easily
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
encountered
sharp
carbonation
light
mouthfeel
and
overwhelming
drinkability
this
one
is
a
winner
nicely
done
drinkability
if
this
were
ontap
more
often
itd
be
my
goto
beer
in
the
city
i
had
two
glasses
at
park
chow
one
on
its
own
the
other
paired
with
lasagna
and
a
fresh
salad
it
was
a
great
fit
in
both
situations
if
you
ever
spot
this
beer
give
it
a
try
d
well
i
came
into
it
wanting
to
like
this
a
lot
the
keg
at
the
magnolia
kicked
when
i
was
there
earlier
in
the
day
so
i
was
very
happy
to
see
this
on
tap
at
the
toronado
my
first
thought
is
that
this
is
just
an
old
keg
or
maybe
it
hadnt
been
poured
in
a
while
and
was
sitting
in
the
lines
but
at
a
place
like
the
toronado
i
wouldnt
expect
this
at
any
rate
the
diacetyl
was
overpowering
and
really
killed
my
enjoyment
level
on
this
id
love
to
give
this
one
another
shot
at
some
point
but
at
least
for
now
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
or
my
expectations
easy
on
the
mouth
properly
carbonated
a
real
pounder
oh
and
i
pounded
it
enjoyed
on
tap
at
toronado
yellow
coloured
body
with
a
white
head
grainy
very
nice
session
ale
medium
mouthfeel
lightly
sweet
to
me
a
good
lager
not
much
hops
detected
by
my
palate
and
its
early
in
the
day
i
am
open
minded
but
i
was
expecting
more
appropriate
carbonation
overall
i
wish
i
could
get
this
more
often
its
nice
to
just
have
a
nice
crisp
pils
every
once
in
a
while
and
this
is
the
best
strawlight
gold
clear
body
huge
rising
carbonation
two
finger
white
soapy
head
slow
dissipation
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
authentic
pilsener
clean
smell
and
a
grassy
hop
presence
taste
is
very
pils
a
bit
sweet
up
front
clean
reminds
me
a
lot
of
trumer
pils
in
a
good
way
but
a
bit
sweeter
mouthfeel
is
light
clean
and
crisp
drinkability
at
this
abv
is
extremely
high
a
bit
hoppy
for
the
style
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
that
just
adds
to
the
allure
of
this
fine
offering
from
moonlight
another
winner
probably
the
best
american
pilsener
ive
had
clear
light
gold
with
a
thin
white
cap
that
faded
to
a
collar
lemony
and
grassy
aroma
a
bit
floral
with
mild
biscuity
malt
in
the
background
solid
bitterness
with
plenty
of
hoppy
flavour
citrus
and
floral
malt
sweetness
hit
midpalate
finished
with
some
mineral
and
herbal
bitterness
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
one
of
the
better
pils
ive
had
from
a
us
brewery
solid
all
around
it
just
didnt
blow
me
away
like
i
expected
it
to
hype
maybe
or
perhaps
i
was
spoiled
by
spending
three
years
in
pa
surrounded
by
top
notch
lagers
md
mouth
is
a
bit
thicker
than
your
might
expect
but
not
menacing
super
drinkable
of
course
good
stuff
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
pilseners
ive
ever
had
ballast
points
pescadero
being
the
other
sampled
at
woodshop
5
0
several
times
great
color
aroma
and
very
drinkable
and
probably
the
lowest
alc
beer
in
the
room
felt
and
drank
fresh
and
would
of
been
even
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
moonlight
makes
some
great
stuff
simple
need
not
mean
simplistic
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
d
perfect
i
could
drink
it
all
night
for
a
beer
to
make
me
reconsider
a
style
completely
i
gotta
give
it
props
medium
body
which
is
happily
much
fuller
than
ai
expected
with
a
nice
crisp
light
hop
presence
up
front
followed
by
a
prominent
pilsner
malt
presence
and
a
very
tasty
earthy
straw
grass
character
very
complex
and
easy
to
drink
abv
is
decently
masked
with
only
slight
alcohol
presence
light
and
crisp
with
a
enough
of
a
subtle
hop
bite
up
front
and
full
malt
body
to
make
it
complex
and
interesting
recommended
this
beer
does
have
the
lovely
pilsner
quality
of
disappearing
from
the
palate
immediately
leaving
you
ready
for
more
and
more
i
could
drink
buckets
of
this
stuff
and
find
it
to
be
a
unique
and
pleasant
take
on
a
very
old
style
d
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
pilsner
goes
down
easily
nocely
balanced
not
filling
and
one
to
sit
with
for
an
evening
d
this
is
a
really
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
im
not
generally
much
of
a
lager
fan
but
this
just
has
such
great
flavors
and
a
nice
light
feel
to
it
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
beer
is
less
than
5
abv
but
is
full
of
all
the
pilsner
qualities
and
more
then
molded
together
in
a
way
like
no
other
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
its
an
outstanding
pilsner
only
brazils
very
own
bamberg
tcheca
comes
close
among
pilsners
in
my
book
the
flavor
echoes
the
smell
to
some
extent
with
the
noble
hopping
the
straw
character
comes
through
for
a
nice
moderate
bitterness
crisp
finish
with
a
little
bit
of
earth
to
it
medium
bodied
with
a
prickly
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
it
wasnt
the
mindblowing
experience
that
i
had
expected
just
a
real
nice
pils
to
enjoy
definitely
the
best
example
of
a
pilsner
from
california
at
least
i
had
this
on
tap
at
toronados
in
san
francisco
the
beer
was
clear
with
a
little
haze
gold
colored
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
toasted
malts
with
some
light
citrus
like
lemons
or
at
most
orange
the
taste
was
similar
to
pilsner
urquell
at
least
as
much
as
i
remember
it
lightly
hopped
and
understated
which
is
ok
for
the
style
good
carbonation
medium
body
everything
is
ok
but
not
mindblowing
like
i
hoped
from
a
beer
thats
been
on
the
top
100
for
so
long
not
sure
what
the
appeal
has
been
with
this
beer
i
definitely
didnt
feel
interested
enough
to
get
a
second
one
d
pretty
drinkable
but
not
more
so
than
most
for
the
style
i
didnt
detect
nearly
as
much
of
a
hop
presence
as
others
have
discussed
so
ill
make
sure
to
revisit
it
again
in
the
future
d
a
fairly
good
czech
pils
probably
wouldnt
make
it
my
go
to
pils
though
d
very
drinkable
you
could
session
the
hell
out
of
this
one
d
super
drinkable
i
finished
my
glass
in
no
time
and
could
easily
have
had
plenty
of
this
although
flavorwise
it
paled
in
comparison
to
the
amazing
death
taxes
again
soo
friggin
cool
that
i
was
able
to
land
this
one
i
had
all
but
written
it
off
without
a
trip
out
west
but
never
say
never
one
of
the
best
session
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
would
drink
this
all
day
if
i
could
d
while
im
rarely
up
at
toronado
i
could
see
myself
having
this
again
when
im
looking
for
something
more
refreshing
and
lighter
on
the
palate
than
a
big
hop
or
malt
bomb
lovely
brew
draught
at
toronado
sf
finally
ive
seen
this
on
the
menu
at
the
red
down
in
santa
cruz
at
least
three
times
and
the
keg
seems
to
always
have
just
kicked
i
started
to
get
into
the
style
while
i
was
on
the
east
coast
and
this
definitely
hangs
with
the
top
american
stuff
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
bread
and
spicy
noble
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
quite
hoppy
but
with
a
nice
fresh
bread
malt
body
to
balance
the
hops
are
pretty
spicy
and
finish
with
a
medium
bitterness
there
is
a
light
mineral
quality
as
well
the
malt
is
very
evocative
of
grain
and
fresh
bread
light
bodied
but
not
thin
in
the
mouth
very
solid
pilsener
overall
d
a
very
good
beer
it
improves
with
every
sip
very
addicting
but
am
unsure
of
it
deserving
of
a
top
100
beer
i
think
pilsener
urquell
is
a
better
example
for
the
style
still
very
good
this
to
me
is
a
perfect
session
beer
i
love
how
light
this
beer
is
and
the
generous
hop
character
keeps
me
going
back
for
more
served
in
a
moonlight
glass
at
flavor
bistro
in
santa
rosa
on
020609
beautiful
opaque
golden
with
a
perfect
white
foamy
head
simply
gorgeous
in
the
glass
wonderful
aroma
of
a
romp
through
some
wheatfields
with
a
subtle
but
nice
fragrance
crisp
toasty
breadiness
noted
on
the
first
sip
like
a
triscut
cracker
spoton
crispy
hop
bitterness
in
the
flavor
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
mouthfeel
picked
up
more
of
the
perfume
up
front
in
the
body
wonderful
melange
of
crisp
cracker
breadiness
and
subtle
crisp
hopiness
very
honored
to
have
tried
this
beer
perhaps
the
best
americanmade
pilsner
out
there
pint
at
toronado
for
three
dollars
and
some
change
during
happy
hour
a
week
ago
reviewed
from
notes
finally
get
to
try
this
top
100
beer
color
is
a
golden
yellow
with
some
cloudy
orange
thrown
into
the
mix
aroma
is
of
toasted
pilsner
malts
floral
hoppiness
bread
butter
grapefruit
lemons
flowers
grass
and
mild
spice
flavor
starts
off
bready
and
quite
chewy
for
its
style
middle
is
toasted
with
buttery
bread
finish
is
a
mix
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
wow
i
kept
asking
myself
if
this
was
really
a
pilsner
and
in
fact
it
is
a
very
good
one
like
the
grassy
accents
once
it
warms
great
finish
that
is
crisp
until
the
end
mouthfeel
is
chewy
dry
citrusy
and
slightly
sweet
medium
bodied
but
still
on
the
thinner
side
crisp
level
of
carbonation
taste
lingers
a
very
long
time
for
its
style
so
much
flavor
packed
into
a
beer
that
is
less
than
five
percent
drinks
very
easily
super
light
and
refreshing
could
have
drank
numerous
pints
i
want
more
as
i
am
writing
this
review
too
bad
this
stuff
is
not
bottled
like
the
picture
deceives
us
of
world
class
beer
coming
from
a
great
northern
california
brewery
will
be
drinking
this
ever
time
i
see
it
now
quite
the
session
beer
to
say
the
least
this
is
worth
the
hype
and
is
phenomenal
for
its
style
never
thought
a
pilsner
could
have
such
great
fruit
character
highly
recommended
easily
the
best
domestic
pilsner
i
have
ever
tasted
impressive
while
a
perfectly
drinkable
and
perfectly
easy
to
drink
beer
this
isnt
something
i
see
myself
asking
for
again
particularly
when
its
dark
cousin
death
and
taxes
keeps
calling
my
name
so
seductively
easily
the
best
pilsener
that
ive
had
so
far
ive
been
nothing
but
impressed
with
moonlight
brewing
thus
far
its
a
shame
that
they
dont
put
out
greater
volume
and
some
bottling
would
certainly
be
nice
reality
czeck
is
an
excellent
beer
and
a
bit
of
a
surprise
for
someone
who
hasnt
had
many
good
lagers
like
me
the
beer
is
golden
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
cleanly
hoppy
and
crisp
with
freshness
there
is
some
excellent
pale
malt
balancing
things
out
the
beer
has
wonderful
grain
flavors
almost
the
opposite
of
normal
stale
macro
pilseners
there
are
light
hop
notes
mostly
pine
and
grass
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
of
lemons
the
malt
and
grain
flavors
are
just
right
and
so
much
better
than
cheap
lagers
that
its
like
night
and
day
you
taste
the
fresh
grains
that
go
into
this
beer
and
theyre
crisp
and
bready
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
just
right
for
a
pilsener
its
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
one
of
the
most
sessionable
beers
that
ive
tried
note
i
like
this
one
a
lot
more
than
the
numerical
score
indicates
d
man
the
whole
place
was
pounding
this
one
and
i
can
see
why
the
perfect
pils
great
pilsner
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
new
glarus
pilsners
with
a
bunch
more
hops
just
a
great
example
of
a
pilsner
rivaling
those
that
have
been
doing
it
for
centuries
wish
it
was
more
widely
available
on
tap
at
toronado
sf
sept

pours
the
usual
golden
pils
colour
with
good
clarity
reasonable
ivory
coloured
head
nose
spicy
fresh
mown
grass
taste
light
toasty
malts
with
the
spicygrassy
kick
of
the
saaz
hops
finishes
quite
dry
with
crisp
bitterness
carbonation
levels
are
moderate
making
for
an
easy
refreshing
quaffer
ontap
at
toronado
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
this
after
having
had
it
a
number
of
times
great
brewery
and
a
great
beer
pours
pale
gold
with
a
pure
white
head
and
some
lacing
aromas
of
spicy
hops
and
some
lager
yeast
long
and
spicy
in
the
nose
very
nice
hops
that
seem
super
fresh
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
nice
crispness
especially
fresh
and
spicy
hops
for
the
style
and
a
long
yeasty
finish
full
and
rounded
with
the
trademark
softness
of
the
czech
pilsner
style
but
a
bit
spicier
and
tangier
than
czech
versions
while
not
approaching
the
earthy
bitterness
and
uber
crispness
of
the
german
style
a
bit
spritzy
on
the
moiuthfeel
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
just
a
fine
beer
all
around
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
decently
thick
white
head
forms
drops
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
on
the
glass
settles
to
a
layer
looks
quite
fine
smell
is
great
honey
grass
nice
biscuity
malt
very
clean
musty
grapes
nice
herbal
hoppiness
some
floral
light
but
lots
of
aroma
taste
is
better
some
sweet
maltiness
biscuittoast
in
the
middle
grass
floral
totally
ripping
herbal
bitterness
in
the
finish
along
with
a
light
saltymineral
character
i
was
digging
mouthfeel
is
awesome
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
super
smooth
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
pilsner
very
clean
malts
and
perfect
bitterness
and
hoppy
goodness
i
wish
i
could
get
something
like
this
here
i
loved
it
taste
was
more
robust
with
some
nice
woodsyearthy
hops
and
a
crisp
citrus
zest
along
with
a
sharp
bitter
twang
but
id
probably
order
about
half
a
dozen
other
beers
on
the
toronado
menu
again
before
revisiting
this
one
i
will
say
that
its
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
superb
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
pleasant
brew
indeed
reality
czeck
is
simply
a
super
hopped
up
version
of
a
czech
pilsener
frankly
i
was
expecting
a
whole
lot
more
from
this
brew
had
this
on
tap
this
weekend
at
both
the
toronado
and
flavor
bistro
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
while
having
an
awesome
snappy
hoppiness
to
it
it
finishes
clean
without
a
huge
amount
of
lingering
bitterness
or
sweetness
i
remember
prima
pils
being
somewhat
like
this
but
the
crispness
and
refreshing
feeling
of
this
brew
easily
make
it
the
best
ive
ever
tried
from
the
pilsner
category
revisiting
this
after
forever
at
flavor
beautiful
hoppy
crackery
bready
nose
earthy
lemony
hops
brilliant
stuff
the
palate
opens
with
a
lemony
bitterness
snappy
and
doughy
cracker
malt
character
mild
honey
like
sweetness
bitter
drying
finish
doughy
and
with
a
little
sweetness
awesome
upping
appearance
and
nose
by
5
and
taste
by
25
changing
overall
to
4
5
overall
incredibly
easy
to
drink
i
polished
off
the
first
quickly
then
slowed
down
a
bit
with
the
second
to
enjoy
it
strongly
encourage
trying
this
one
the
taste
is
similar
a
fullbodied
lightly
sweet
grainbread
lager
with
plenty
of
citrusypiney
hop
flavour
to
just
dominate
it
it
is
crisp
but
smooth
and
full
of
longlasting
flavour
a
good
beer
but
a
czech
pils
is
like
someone
doing
ballet
gracefully
elegant
this
pint
was
more
like
a
hiphop
dancer
definitely
an
american
version
of
the
style
not
only
the
best
pilsener
ive
ever
had
but
possibly
the
best
session
beer
and
i
could
drink
this
everyday
on
tap
at
city
beer
store
in
s
f
thanks
to
craig
for
the
sample
of
this
smell
was
somehow
of
a
spiced
cream
corn
and
not
corn
in
the
way
that
cheap
beers
smell
or
taste
of
corn
light
clearish
yellow
color
with
a
unique
taste
to
match
the
smell
has
a
nice
almost
spiced
maybe
subtle
bitter
bite
to
it
and
was
quite
nice
an
interesting
beer
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
a
shot
at
it
d
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
i
had
pliny
the
younger
right
before
this
and
i
think
the
awesomeness
of
that
beer
overshadowed
this
one
a
lot
its
a
good
brew
but
i
dont
think
it
can
hold
a
candle
to
prima
pils
this
is
what
a
pilsner
should
be
light
and
crisp
but
full
of
flavor
i
could
drink
this
all
day
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
thin
white
head
the
taste
is
crisp
dry
hops
this
has
become
what
i
will
judge
pilsners
against
if
only
it
was
easier
to
find
served
on
tap
at
the
toronado
it
has
a
clear
golden
colored
body
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
with
a
crisp
hop
presence
leading
a
good
malt
backbone
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
i
can
actually
picture
the
hops
and
barley
when
i
smell
it
the
flavor
has
good
bitterness
actually
a
bit
more
than
i
expected
for
a
light
pilsener
behind
the
bitterness
is
that
same
strong
malt
backbone
that
was
in
the
aroma
hop
flavor
is
not
very
strong
at
all
the
body
is
not
quite
as
light
as
i
would
have
expected
but
still
fairly
light
this
would
make
an
excellent
summer
drinker
this
is
an
excellent
low
abv
choice
that
is
highly
drinkable
highly
recommended
biscuity
slight
caramel
maltiness
leaves
things
fresh
and
creamy
with
a
floral
hopping
that
interacts
to
a
tee
wonderful
carbonation
has
a
spritzy
tingly
sensation
on
the
finish
lemony
with
a
bit
of
a
buttery
cereal
driven
kick
one
to
session
for
a
week
note
so
this
is
a
perfect
pilsner
from
now
on
i
will
gage
pilsners
which
are
much
much
more
common
here
in
the
heartland
then
they
are
on
the
west
coast
against
this
beer
although
this
is
certainly
a
great
beer
i
think
i
will
find
that
there
are
many
pilsners
made
by
small
breweries
here
in
wisconsin
that
can
stand
up
to
reality
czech
that
being
said
kudos
to
moonlight
one
of
my
favorite
bay
area
brewers
as
far
as
pilsners
go
this
one
goes
to
11
im
extremely
pleased
to
have
tried
it
and
its
an
essential
brew
if
youre
in
the
bay
area
d
incredibly
drinkable
and
smooth
a
great
pilsner
i
could
drink
this
all
day
the
epitome
of
a
session
beer
this
is
my
first
beer
from
moonlight
and
if
they
are
all
as
good
as
the
pilsner
im
in
for
a
treat
when
i
can
find
them
a
great
beer
allaround
the
best
pilsner
in
the
world
d
my
first
introduction
to
this
excellent
beer
did
not
disappoint
paired
well
with
grilled
wild
boar
sausage
and
onions
seemed
perfectly
easy
to
drink
with
or
without
the
benefit
of
food
to
pair
with
it
could
be
the
smoothest
most
drinkable
pilsener
i
can
recall
trying
to
date
highly
recommended
a
perfectly
clear
strawcolored
pils
without
much
head
to
speak
this
was
mostly
due
to
the
way
the
bartender
poured
it
though
because
the
carbonation
was
just
fine
pretty
subtle
aroma
pale
malts
grainy
and
grassy
lots
of
fresh
floral
hops
the
taste
closely
mirrors
the
smell
bready
pale
malts
and
a
surprisingly
strong
hop
kick
at
the
end
that
lingers
on
the
palate
for
quite
a
while
very
clean
and
simple
light
in
body
and
crisply
carbonated
exactly
as
a
pilsner
should
be
it
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
victorys
prima
pils
but
with
a
cleaner
taste
and
better
balance
between
malt
and
hops
i
really
cant
imagine
a
better
pilsener
overall
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
if
toronado
didnt
have
so
many
other
tempting
brews
this
lived
up
to
all
the
hype
for
me
ill
admit
that
im
not
the
biggest
pilsner
fan
out
there
but
im
just
not
understanding
why
everyone
is
going
apeshit
for
this
brew
i
would
actually
place
victorys
prima
pils
on
tap
ahead
of
this
beer
argue
if
you
must
but
im
standing
my
ground
this
beer
has
superior
drinkability
and
can
quench
with
the
best
of
them
during
the
hot
summer
months
sucka
jeah
highly
highly
recommended
this
is
probably
the
first
time
i
have
gotten
truly
excited
about
a
pilsener
let
alone
rating
it
in
the
top
beers
i
have
had
of
all
time
so
yes
its
that
good
track
this
down
perfect
for
the
warm
temps
that
are
approaching
drinkability
generally
pilsners
can
be
drunk
in
quantity
but
this
one
is
so
aggressively
bitter
that
by
the
end
of
the
pint
i
felt
i
had
to
give
my
tastebuds
a
rest
the
floral
tones
at
the
end
of
each
sip
were
quite
memorable
and
certainly
set
this
beer
apart
d
i
cant
imagine
a
beer
being
more
drinkable
or
sessionable
than
this
beauty
it
is
extremely
smooth
flavorful
and
drinkable
a
perfect
beer
for
enjoying
a
beautiful
spring
afternoon
d
at
4
8
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
very
refreshing
and
tasty
and
uncloying
and
just
absolutely
great
an
exceptional
beer
incredibly
balanced
tasty
and
flavorful
ridiculously
drinkable
a
beer
with
a
cohesive
and
delightful
personality
even
if
it
doesnt
quite
adhere
to
the
style
shows
that
the
world
of
great
american
beer
doesnt
start
and
stop
with
ales
if
youre
in
northern
california
dont
stop
with
the
ipas
and
sour
belgianstyles
make
sure
you
try
some
reality
czeck
overall
seems
wrong
to
give
a
perfect
5
0
but
this
really
is
that
good
to
try
to
improve
it
would
be
like
killing
the
goose
that
lays
the
golden
egg
ondraft
fresh
from
the
tap
at
flavor
bistro
in
santa
rosa
this
was
simply
stunning
exquisite
dangerously
drinkable
and
effortlessly
addictive
believe
the
hype
and
laugh
at
prima
pils
some
slight
deviations
and
variations
from
the
better
homespun
czech
pils
style
that
those
anal
nitpickers
revel
in
i
ignore
them
all
for
the
simple
reason
that
my
first
taste
of
this
literally
reminded
and
mentally
transported
me
back
to
my
first
trip
to
the
then
czechoslovakia
it
had
me
eulogizing
about
those
first
halflitres
of
pilsner
urquell
starobrno
gambrinus
and
budvar
that
i
tried
way
back
in
1991
in
that
respect
this
is
where
the
reality
czeck
wins
hands
down
forget
my
original
reason
to
visit
russian
river
sampling
the
reality
czech
at
flavor
bistro
was
worth
the
900
mile
round
trip
from
long
beach
to
santa
rosa
just
for
this
alone
mouthfeel
is
light
smooth
and
even
somewhat
creamy
plenty
of
bubbly
carbonation
flows
down
with
each
sip
supremely
drinkable
i
could
seriously
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
this
brew
all
night
long
a
stellar
pilsner
with
a
plentiful
hop
bite
at
4
8
if
i
was
near
moonlight
and
somewhere
that
had
this
on
tap
regularly
i
think
i
might
be
in
trouble
now
its
time
for
me
to
visit
california
and
get
more
yum
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
crisp
clean
pilsener
make
a
hell
of
a
session
brew
pilseners
not
my
big
thing
but
this
one
is
nice
22
oz
bottle
hand
bottled
via
counter
pressure
filler
the
beer
is
a
brilliant
straw
yellow
color
with
absolutely
no
haze
at
all
a
massive
carbonation
is
seen
maintaining
a
finger
of
head
over
top
of
the
brew
very
good
looking
beer
the
nose
brings
a
mild
honeykissed
pilsener
malt
sweetness
a
mild
grainyness
and
a
solid
herbal
and
spicy
noble
hop
that
really
entices
me
to
drink
this
one
as
i
sip
it
i
find
this
one
brings
an
excellent
herbal
noble
hop
that
moves
to
a
moderate
to
strong
bitterness
behind
this
is
a
mild
grainy
character
and
a
very
subtle
sweetness
the
bitter
lingers
really
nicely
into
the
finish
drawing
me
back
for
more
and
more
of
this
one
the
balance
here
is
fantastic
definitely
one
of
the
best
pilsener
beers
ever
to
grace
my
glass
after
letting
my
palate
sit
for
a
minute
after
a
drink
there
is
a
sweetness
that
sticks
to
my
tongue
and
works
really
well
against
the
bitterness
that
clings
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
very
solid
carbonation
that
breaks
it
up
and
keeps
it
feeling
really
light
and
smooth
drinkability
is
top
notch
on
this
one
this
is
a
beer
i
would
love
to
see
on
tap
so
i
could
belly
up
and
drink
it
till
the
keg
was
done
it
is
big
in
flavor
balance
and
clarity
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
believe
the
hype
and
will
be
looking
for
this
one
when
i
hit
california
early
next
year
this
is
a
great
czech
pilsener
cheers
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
bright
white
head
over
the
clear
light
golden
brew
head
lasts
very
well
with
ample
artful
delicate
lacing
aroma
is
pale
grain
sweetness
upfront
giving
way
to
saaz
crispness
flavor
is
also
light
malts
and
crisp
hoppiness
but
im
kind
of
at
a
loss
to
put
into
words
how
well
everything
melds
together
nary
even
an
aftertaste
which
often
dooms
some
in
the
style
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
extra
smooth
and
drinkability
is
superb
as
well
if
this
is
better
on
tap
i
cant
wait
to
make
sure
reality
czech
is
my
first
moonlight
brew
and
i
have
to
say
that
im
impressed
especially
with
its
balance
and
its
drinkability
not
that
i
needed
any
more
impetus
but
savoring
the
final
few
ounces
of
this
incredible
beer
leads
me
to
cast
my
mind
back
to
that
toolongdelayed
trip
to
santa
rosa
in
addition
to
wallowing
in
great
food
and
great
beer
id
love
to
be
able
to
thank
redwoodgeorge
in
person
this
is
the
ultimate
session
beer
certainly
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
tried
the
22
oz
bottle
provided
by
george
filled
two
tall
pils
glasses
which
emptied
in
what
seemed
to
be
record
time
damn
this
stuff
is
off
the
scale
in
drinkability
the
things
that
makes
this
beer
the
stuff
of
legends
are
not
excessively
creative
flavor
blends
or
double
extreme
anything
its
the
presentation
of
a
fresh
flavorful
session
beer
that
incorporates
massive
amounts
of
taste
practically
nothing
offkilter
and
the
ability
to
session
the
hell
out
of
it
i
would
drink
the
shit
out
of
this
beer
if
it
was
available
to
me
locally
a
true
treat
and
an
excellent
green
west
coaster
drinkability
will
be
questionable
for
lots
of
people
this
is
a
very
aggressive
pilsner
if
you
loved
sam
adams
imperial
pilsner
you
will
love
this
if
you
like
regular
type
lagers
and
try
this
as
just
a
little
stronger
you
will
get
shocked
this
is
a
lot
stronger
than
most
any
lager
you
could
name
like
a
big
hop
smack
you
will
love
it
if
you
dont
you
will
be
over
powered
it
poured
hazy
straw
gold
with
lots
of
champagne
bubbles
light
aroma
of
saaz
hops
it
had
an
earthy
character
mushrooms
possibly
a
little
green
apple
taste
is
crisp
clean
very
sparse
i
detect
that
earthiness
again
in
the
flavor
light
crisp
and
clean
with
a
biting
tartness
from
the
hops
used
extremely
drinkable
this
would
be
an
unbelievable
warm
weather
beer
it
was
worth
the
wait
drinkability

i
ordered
a
round
of
three
and
somehow
got
four
beers
out
of
it
i
bogarted
the
extra
one
and
had
no
problem
finishing
it
really
you
cant
stop
at
flavor
bistro
without
ordering
at
least
two
of
these
moonlight
brewing
specials
one
to
down
in
three
gulps
out
of
sheer
decadence
and
the
other
to
drink
like
a
gentleman
edit
i
have
since
learned
that
no
saaz
is
used
in
this
beer
rather
an
unlikely
combination
of
american
hops
its
still
the
best
beer
i
have
had
to
date
and
i
wish
it
were
more
accessible
all
i
can
say
is
this
is
a
must
try
it
if
you
have
a
chance
i
have
been
a
fan
of
moonlight
since
i
randomly
ordered
a
death
and
taxes
during
my
first
trip
to
toronado
about
two
years
ago
when
i
order
a
moonlight
i
expect
a
beer
that
is
completely
unorthodox
with
no
definable
style
the
devil
may
care
vibe
of
moonlight
always
made
it
an
interesting
choice
and
never
a
disappointment
but
unlike
i
am
used
to
reality
czeck
is
a
completely
different
this
is
not
a
take
on
the
pilsner
style
it
is
not
an
americanized
variation
or
a
stylistic
homage
it
is
a
straight
up
czeck
pilsner
just
the
pinnacle
of
craft
that
i
have
had
so
far
there
is
a
refinement
to
a
style
i
had
passed
on
that
makes
this
beer
so
damn
enjoyable
extremely
versatile
damn
delicious
world
class
drinkability
please
oh
please
bottle
this
session
beer
at
its
best
best
pils
hands
down
so
well
put
together
and
balanced
thanks
to
venom
for
putting
this
on
the
ba
radar
screen
drinkability
and
notes

great
drinkability
because
of
the
superb
balance
and
terrific
flavor
this
is
probably
the
second
best
pilsner
i
have
had
behind
only
prima
pils
i
wish
it
had
been
more
carbonated
but
it
was
still
a
good
craft
brewed
pilsner
as
for
drinkability
theres
no
real
question
this
pilsner
may
be
difficult
to
find
but
its
worth
the
trip
lunch
at
flavor
is
quite
affordable
and
ive
already
made
a
date
to
go
back
there
in
a
week
for
more
pils
816
sampled
at
the
boonville
beerfest
fresh
keg
tapped
at
zeitgeist
in
the
mission
bright
gold
goldy
gold
the
most
gold
that
fucking
gold
can
get
in
a
beer
perfectly
sized
and
contained
head
of
thick
egg
cream
white
foam
aromas
are
al
that
a
pils
should
be
and
nothing
that
a
pils
shouldnt
be
floral
germanus
hop
varities
lend
this
brew
a
great
aroma
of
lemon
lime
bread
dough
flowers
oranges
and
more
the
taste
is
a
combination
of
the
aromas
but
intensified
unified
and
perfected
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
to
light
with
an
intense
small
bubbled
carbonation
that
never
lets
up
lending
this
brew
a
perfect
drinkability
insanely
drinkable
refreshing
and
subtle
yet
horribly
complex
and
thought
provoking
this
is
beer
it
is
medium
in
body
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
has
a
crisp
bitterness
at
times
and
is
enjoyable
but
it
could
be
even
more
enjoyable
if
some
of
the
residual
sugar
was
stripped
away
unique
and
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
its
semisweet
in
a
body
that
straddles
the
line
between
light
and
medium
all
the
way
crisp
and
bright
it
moves
gently
into
a
semidry
finish
very
enjoyable
beer
that
tasted
better
poured
than
from
the
can
the
pilsner
malt
flavor
wasnt
over
bearing
or
too
strong
as
is
the
case
with
most
pilsners
it
was
a
well
balanced
beer
there
was
little
to
no
hop
aroma
or
flavor
it
was
very
light
in
color
and
taste
yes
yet
another
can
courtesy
of
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
malts
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
is
crisp
malts
grains
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
beer
a
nice
loud
crack
revealed
a
brimful
can
so
in
salute
to
the
brewers
i
utilized
an
inverted
glug
the
pseudocascade
was
brilliant
finally
settling
into
two
fingers
of
dense
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
color
was
like
liquid
sunshine
with
a
slight
haziness
srm
4
to
5
perfect
for
a
rainy
spring
afternoon
the
three
gold
stooges
croesus
mammon
and
midas
seemed
to
agree
as
they
all
showed
up
for
a
taste
but
i
was
having
none
of
it
it
had
a
nicely
controlled
spicy
nose
just
enough
to
tickle
my
sinuses
and
get
my
mouth
watering
but
not
enough
to
be
too
much
of
a
good
thing
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
saaz
hops
really
interacted
well
with
the
yeast
and
the
malt
knew
enough
to
stand
pat
creating
the
king
of
pilsner
that
i
really
dig
too
many
aals
under
the
bridge
and
ger
pilsners
tend
to
be
too
sweet
for
my
liking
finish
was
dry
slightly
spicy
slightly
grassy
and
definitely
refreshing
this
would
be
ideal
on
a
hot
humid
summers
day
poured
to
a
nice
full
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
head
was
white
and
fairly
dense
appearance
was
a
light
straw
color
with
a
slight
haze
aroma
had
some
fruit
and
yeasty
notes
tastes
light
with
some
mild
grass
and
grain
notes
mild
aftertaste
with
a
medium
mouth
feel
its
better
then
thier
brown
lager
ill
say
that
12oz
can
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
virtually
no
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
some
sour
notes
some
floral
hops
with
hints
of
hay
the
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
malts
and
cereal
slightly
sour
with
some
toasted
malts
toward
the
end
some
floral
hop
bitterness
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
decent
pilsner
still
a
decent
drinking
pilsner
o
overall
very
impressive
beer
let
alone
pilsner
really
tasty
really
easy
drinking
and
a
great
crossover
beer
for
trying
to
convert
a
macro
drinker
a
pilsner
done
right
cheers
o
not
a
bad
pilsner
im
not
crazy
about
the
citrus
aspect
but
the
malt
flavors
are
very
nice
golden
clear
color
with
a
two
inch
head
and
some
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
mostly
a
citrusy
grassy
aroma
with
a
faint
cereal
grain
the
taste
has
that
nice
grassy
lemony
doughy
characteristic
found
in
a
summery
pils
the
finish
has
a
nice
hoppy
bite
followed
by
a
clean
crisp
maltiness
great
option
for
the
summer
time
refreshing
and
easydrinking
o
very
refreshing
pilsner
that
displays
the
taste
profile
i
look
for
the
grassy
and
lemony
flavors
are
both
in
full
effect
and
excellent
o
took
a
shot
on
a
brewery
i
had
never
heard
of
and
it
paid
off
it
isnt
mind
blowing
but
definitely
a
solid
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
the
time
o
this
beer
becomes
a
lot
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
up
and
bready
malts
dominate
more
of
the
flavor
and
are
accompanied
by
sweetness
o
where
has
this
been
all
my
life
one
of
the
best
ive
had
this
summer
great
choice
for
those
not
yet
into
crafts
really
tasty
and
a
great
american
pilsner
cheers
a
solid
beer
with
some
good
dextrins
holding
it
up
will
be
drinking
much
more
of
this
until
the
playoffs
draw
to
a
close
from
a
growler
fill
from
brazen
head
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
small
sized
head
smells
slightly
floral
with
a
bit
of
banana
action
very
light
body
with
lingering
carmelish
sweetness
hops
not
really
assertive
enough
on
this
one
for
my
liking
and
the
resulting
is
a
fairly
tired
beer
not
the
best
kelso
style
around
only
tastes
from
now
on
in
the
beerquest
only
tastes
drinkability
a
solid
pilsner
a
faithful
interpretation
of
the
style
d
defintily
a
drinkable
beer
nothing
to
say
wow
about
but
refreshing
and
tasty
like
the
scent
it
had
a
limited
taste
it
had
some
maltiness
to
it
but
not
that
nice
biting
sourness
that
i
like
from
a
czech
pils
lacks
a
bitterness
to
it
very
meh
d
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
lot
very
nice
example
of
the
style
boring
but
great
d
perfectly
boring
for
a
daily
drinker
i
need
a
sunny
day
for
this
tastes
of
roasted
malt
yeast
light
grains
and
some
very
faint
hops
very
light
and
crisp
with
mild
flavor
and
good
lacing
a
middle
of
the
road
to
above
average
pilsner
that
fits
in
the
pilsner
category
well
easy
to
drink
just
a
bit
boring
as
far
as
flavor
goes
for
my
liking
hop
bitterness
overpowers
any
spicy
notes
that
this
beer
has
overall
i
would
say
too
much
bittering
in
this
beer
it
ruins
any
real
hop
character
that
a
good
vzech
pils
needs
decent
body
not
a
bad
example
at
all
and
worth
a
look
if
you
come
across
it
i
had
never
heard
of
this
brewery
before
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
when
i
had
it
a
very
good
crisp
pilsner
quality
with
a
decent
aroma
and
great
flavor
very
refreshing
i
think
i
drank
it
down
in
about
two
minutes
would
recommend
this
one
if
you
can
find
it
nicely
drinkable
beer
great
with
food
id
like
a
bit
more
of
a
grassy
hop
character
a
bit
less
spicy
but
thats
a
relatively
minor
quibble
this
is
a
crystal
clear
awesome
looking
pilsener
could
have
a
little
bit
more
gas
but
the
color
is
excellent
taste
is
very
clear
and
light
could
deserve
a
little
bit
more
hops
it
belongs
definitely
to
the
premier
league
of
pilsener
i
had
in
the
us
pilsners
are
always
a
bit
of
a
gamble
and
i
never
know
what
to
expect
some
offer
a
blissful
balance
of
wholesome
malt
and
zestful
hops
while
others
have
a
maltiness
so
feeble
and
plain
that
you
can
hardly
taste
the
grain
this
one
is
closer
to
the
former
and
is
a
simple
but
well
structured
example
of
the
style
a
real
joy
to
drink
when
i
poured
this
it
has
golden
color
body
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
grassy
and
grainey
the
taste
is
dull
i
get
some
wheat
flavor
and
a
grassy
undertone
no
hops
present
the
moutheel
is
kinda
watery
and
overall
it
doesnt
impress
me
at
all
othis
is
pretty
middleoftheroad
effort
the
grain
flavor
is
somewhat
off
and
the
butter
notes
do
not
do
much
for
me
the
vaguely
bitter
soapy
finish
does
not
compensate
for
the
funky
buttery
grain
flavors
up
front
and
the
feel
was
inviting
at
first
but
about
halfway
through
the
glass
it
became
sore
of
annoying
meh
overall
a
bit
of
a
mess
with
dms
and
diacetyl
o
not
your
run
of
the
mil
czech
pilz
its
got
some
interesting
flavors
i
cant
pin
point
but
its
enjoyable
the
hop
flavor
is
excellent
havent
had
anything
from
shorts
in
a
long
time
got
this
single
for
less
than
a
buck
fifty
good
buy
it
pours
almost
perfectly
clear
and
really
pale
yellow
with
excellent
carbonation
visible
inch
of
white
head
doesnt
last
long
nose
of
lovely
and
bready
ale
yeast
as
well
as
more
hops
than
most
american
pilsener
types
the
flavor
is
really
good
smooth
and
a
little
sweet
still
hoppy
but
moved
by
pilsener
malts
refreshing
and
interesting
for
the
style
something
sweet
like
a
cream
ale
towards
the
finish
and
a
bit
of
body
too
its
bright
and
in
a
genre
where
the
yeast
is
usually
not
heard
from
i
appreciate
its
forward
position
in
this
beer
cleaner
finish
even
though
its
sweet
and
an
expansive
body
mature
beyond
its
light
malt
youth
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
one
of
the
better
from
shorts
its
down
easy
and
while
not
totally
unique
its
a
nice
reinvention
of
the
style
in
a
way
thats
more
pleasurable
to
me
then
even
some
of
the
most
authentic
czech
pilseners

overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
pilsner
style
all
around
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
malt
hop
and
yeast
ester
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
this
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
with
thin
foaming
it
has
a
muted
aroma
that
doesnt
really
develop
however
the
flavor
comes
across
with
a
light
lemony
biscuit
with
some
sodium
bicarbonate
notes
noticeable
minerality
leads
to
a
dull
effervescent
finish
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
pours
a
very
bright
goldenyellow
looks
thin
for
a
pilsner
totally
white
1inch
creamy
head
forms
nose
is
low
on
malt
and
hops
and
suggests
cut
grass
very
light
body
and
palate
with
lingering
bitterness
the
bitterness
is
similar
to
that
of
a
german
or
scandinavian
pilsner
but
the
body
and
flavor
is
not
not
quite
kölschlike
although
the
hops
and
bitterness
are
consistent
with
a
kölsch
too
low
on
hops
and
malt
for
a
czech
pilsner
rings
of
delicate
belgian
lace
form
i
am
not
excited
and
will
not
be
seeking
this
beer
again
o
i
enjoyed
this
and
it
is
not
a
style
i
have
had
much
of
only
budvar
and
urquel
many
years
ago
when
i
visited
prague
the
feel
is
both
creamy
and
crisp
in
a
light
body
its
good
though
a
little
slick
in
the
mouth
o
i
was
sorry
when
this
was
gone
perhaps
closer
to
a
light
ipa
than
pilsener
but
definitely
a
quality
summer
brew
overall
a
pilsener
that
provides
a
nice
flavor
profile
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
a
ton
out
of
shorts
on
this
style
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
found
a
very
light
and
still
pretty
tasty
beer
well
this
one
tasted
much
better
than
it
smelled
mostly
because
it
smelled
almost
like
an
empty
glass
refreshing
overall
though
the
musky
hops
could
lend
a
hand
to
a
headscratching
astringency
it
seems
good
to
wash
a
meal
down
with
which
is
pretty
much
all
i
was
looking
for
just
wish
it
had
something
to
offer
my
nostrils
they
felt
left
out
this
is
the
perfect
balance
and
really
one
of
the
best
versions
of
the
style
ive
tried
the
relatively
low
rating
on
here
puzzles
me
pours
a
bubbly
bright
straw
yellow
with
a
snow
white
head
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
yeast
with
some
earthy
smells
taste
isnt
sweet
as
the
smell
would
suggest
taste
starts
bitter
with
malty
tones
the
bitter
tastes
like
it
came
from
hops
no
yeast
flavors
some
earthy
ones
are
there
a
medium
light
body
very
smooth
great
carbonation
a
nice
beer
good
balance
bitter
without
huge
hop
flavor
tasty
beer
above
average
but
the
lack
of
hops
was
a
let
down
and
made
this
a
bit
boring
highly
drinkable
and
better
than
most
macro
brews
this
is
like
a
craft
beer
training
bra
and
worth
unsnapping
will
not
buy
again
the
last
few
shorts
beers
i
have
had
have
been
a
let
down
o
i
like
this
i
enjoy
a
pint
but
i
probably
wont
actually
buy
6
maybe
for
a
party
tasty
but
too
bitter
a
really
good
pilsner
nice
and
balanced
with
good
crispness
on
both
the
smell
and
taste
tastefeel
as
expected
mild
drinks
a
lot
like
a
light
beer
the
biggest
thing
about
this
beer
that
i
dont
care
for
is
that
instant
it
hits
the
tongue
it
feels
like
carbonated
water
and
thats
really
it
but
once
the
taste
comes
out
its
not
too
bad
theres
a
decent
bit
of
hops
and
even
some
spices
in
there
a
very
mild
aroma
and
taste
but
thats
whats
expected
with
this
style
it
gets
better
as
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
still
a
pretty
ordinary
beer
would
make
a
great
beer
for
summer
pours
a
light
yellow
hazy
color
and
inviting
smell
is
muted
and
not
very
distinct
but
it
smells
like
this
is
beer
tastes
is
very
good
light
not
heavy
on
the
palate
actively
refreshingly
carbonation
and
then
bitter
enough
to
know
that
hops
are
there
and
then
dry
and
fruity
almost
lemony
with
some
sourish
notes
that
make
it
feel
a
bit
like
a
hoppier
farm
ale
or
saison
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
for
a
pilsner
which
usually
isnt
in
the
fridge
i
could
see
getting
a
six
or
a
bottle
of
these
from
time
to
time
nice
offering
pouts
filtered
yellow
with
a
nice
head
nose
is
lots
of
grain
malts
with
slight
grass
presence
taste
is
the
same
lots
of
grainyalts
throughout
and
ends
with
a
slight
grass
bitterness
pretty
solid
take
on
the
pilsner
might
be
the
most
true
to
style
i
have
from
america
although
this
is
a
pretty
short
review
the
sentence
prior
to
this
one
sums
up
my
feelings
on
this
beer
not
über
complex
but
delicious
and
true
to
style
o
not
a
bad
intro
to
shorts
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
a
decent
pils
but
nothing
overwhelming
overall
decent
but
lacks
that
pilsner
hop
flavor
o
a
decent
offering
from
shorts
session
potential
pours
a
bubbly
yellow
not
much
aroma
wise
taste
is
thin
not
the
best
mouthfeel
usually
i
like
a
nice
crisp
pils
but
this
one
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
just
something
about
the
taste
seemed
off
and
a
bit
astringent
a
pretty
average
beer
nothing
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
but
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
as
far
as
style
goes
i
think
its
a
great
american
pilsner
if
were
comparing
this
to
a
traditional
pilsner
i
think
this
falls
a
bit
short
plus
in
my
opinion
it
veers
too
closely
to
a
saison
nevertheless
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
many
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
o
a
nice
simple
nofrills
pilsner
a
very
basic
and
simple
group
of
flavors
with
a
light
body
togther
these
things
combine
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
to
serve
cold
on
a
hot
day
this
was
quite
tasty
and
would
have
again
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
dry
beer
with
tame
flavors
lightly
hazy
pale
straw
yellow
couple
fingers
of
soapy
white
head
light
retention
solid
lace
lots
of
grass
and
cereals
on
the
nose
herbal
grainy
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
noble
hops
about
the
same
on
the
palate
grainy
crackery
malt
light
spicy
hops
but
mostly
grass
and
grains
a
kiss
of
citrus
as
well
fairly
light
body
and
medium
high
carbonation
a
nice
fairly
crisp
pilsner
and
with
lawnmower
beer
potential
m
light
and
refreshing
ample
carbonation
a
good
summer
beer
if
only
it
were
summer
highly
polished
shiny
colors
perfumey
aroma
and
a
buzzsaw
bite
with
enough
bubbles
to
inflate
a
balloon
after
you
burp
them
back
up
that
is
a
decent
american
pils
this
is
no
victory
prima
but
it
will
do
as
a
sub
decent
pils
overall
ok
as
a
czech
version
very
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
overall
im
superimpressed
i
dont
drink
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
pilseners
but
this
stands
up
to
the
few
literally
czech
ones
that
ive
had
good
stuff
of
course
very
sessionable
overall
a
nice
and
drinkable
pilsner
i
enjoy
pilsners
that
have
a
hop
bite
at
the
end
keeps
you
wanting
more
and
pairs
well
with
foods
and
a
hot
summer
day
overall
it
was
really
to
plan
and
close
to
the
style
for
a
repeat
offering
but
i
chock
it
up
to
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
oda
solid
pilsener
wont
blow
you
away
but
it
doesnt
have
much
to
complain
about
its
no
victory
prima
pils
but
it
will
go
down
easy
enough
clear
as
can
be
yellow
decent
carbonation
has
a
hard
time
keeping
any
kind
of
head
up
small
amount
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
nice
because
the
beer
can
continue
lagering
in
storage
smells
like
lager
yeast
clean
and
faint
impressive
grainy
pilsner
flavors
thin
body
and
crisp
finish
has
a
distinct
chech
saaz
character
i
assume
hop
choice
from
grassy
peppery
notes
mild
bitterness
very
refreshing
i
usually
dont
drink
excessively
but
i
gladly
drink
a
bunch
of
these
m
light
to
medium
o
a
very
nice
light
pilsner
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
hops
but
i
still
appreciate
this
one
for
what
it
is
i
could
easily
drink
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
no
problem
o
a
halfway
decent
attempt
at
a
pilsner
im
not
sure
what
the
herbal
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
is
but
it
sort
of
kills
the
drinkability
up
front
its
a
nice
crisp
lemony
pilsner
and
then
it
dies
odd
and
a
shame
because
i
liked
it
at
first
i
give
a
schlitz
for
this
though
lagerstyle
beers
are
not
this
brewerys
forte
lighter
medium
body
decent
carbonation
drinks
super
easy
and
plenty
refreshing
on
the
senses
this
is
a
pretty
nice
pils
that
id
definitely
drink
again
i
also
enjoyed
the
addition
of
corn
to
the
brew
o
this
is
pretty
tasty
for
the
style
will
make
for
an
excellent
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
nice
light
gold
with
sufficient
white
head
smell
while
not
overpowering
was
of
light
bready
grains
tastes
starts
with
mild
malt
bill
and
finishes
clean
with
some
hop
bitterness
a
nice
crisp
pilsner
nicely
priced
so
i
could
see
this
having
a
regular
spot
in
my
fridge
this
summer
pours
out
a
golden
yellow
hue
with
a
two
finger
thick
white
head
that
leaves
minimal
retention
and
lacing
i
do
get
some
grains
bread
some
sweet
malts
in
the
aroma
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
slightly
sweet
taste
followed
by
some
grassy
hops
and
citrus
taste
and
some
bitterness
seems
to
be
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
doesnt
seem
to
be
quite
as
crisp
and
clean
as
i
thought
it
would
be
a
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
and
worth
a
try
d
ok
drinkable
once
you
get
accustomed
to
that
slightly
strange
non
pilsner
flavor
i
afraid
that
this
beer
is
going
in
my
reject
beer
stash
really
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
represents
a
nice
pilsner
but
is
lacking
some
body
or
a
bit
more
flavor
to
be
one
of
the
better
around
id
get
it
again
to
be
sure
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
this
beer
was
just
to
bitter
to
make
it
a
clean
refreshing
pilsner
i
can
taste
a
little
malt
upfront
but
then
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
overwhelms
all
other
taste
sensations
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
good
pilsener
that
was
true
to
the
style
and
it
was
pretty
much
everything
that
it
should
be
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
went
down
very
smooth
and
crisp
it
was
somewhat
refreshing
and
would
make
a
great
beer
to
have
with
dinner
it
was
perfect
with
some
fried
walleye
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
i
dont
think
it
would
be
that
hard
for
me
to
take
a
out
a
six
pack
throughout
the
day
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
pretty
much
everything
all
the
aspects
of
this
beer
seemed
to
be
just
what
you
would
expect
from
a
good
pilsener
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
hardly
anything
but
i
did
think
it
was
a
little
hazy
and
could
have
been
a
little
more
clearer
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
good
pilsener
its
nice
that
this
will
be
available
year
round
if
you
are
a
fan
of
pilseners
then
you
need
to
give
this
beer
a
try
you
wont
be
disappointed
i
am
glad
that
shorts
decided
to
add
this
beer
to
the
year
round
lineup
i
thought
that
the
magician
was
a
pretty
average
beer
so
i
like
the
fact
that
they
exchanged
it
for
an
above
average
pilsener
its
a
pretty
good
move
in
my
opinion
so
far
this
has
to
be
my
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
shorts
really
has
some
skills
when
it
comes
to
this
style
and
it
makes
for
one
tasty
and
easy
drinking
pilsener
that
has
earned
a
spot
in
my
fridge
very
nice
warm
bready
pilsner
not
too
many
craft
pilsners
are
able
or
attempt
to
create
the
level
of
bread
flavors
that
this
beer
generates
these
flavors
dominate
and
almost
need
to
be
scaled
back
to
make
it
more
sessionable
very
similar
to
trumer
pils
another
favorite
ill
definitely
try
it
again
o
not
impressed
but
very
drinkable
expected
a
bit
more
lightly
toasted
bread
malts
up
front
becomes
lightly
sweet
with
notes
of
clover
honey
and
sweetbread
refreshing
sea
air
hops
blow
in
and
make
an
appetizing
foil
for
the
malt
bitterness
becomes
peppier
in
the
finish
very
refreshing
and
dry
some
lingering
honey
biscuit
malt
mediumbodied
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
very
drinkable
and
will
be
great
in
the
summer
o
enjoyable
pilsner
i
would
have
this
again
this
may
become
my
goto
beer
for
easy
drinking
o
i
think
this
was
a
fantastic
move
by
shorts
to
make
this
a
flagship
yearend
beer
this
light
and
crisp
pilsner
affordably
priced
at
7
99six
can
really
help
bring
in
new
nontradtional
craft
beer
drinkers
into
the
mix
hopefully
after
trying
this
it
becomes
a
gateway
drug
in
order
to
be
a
little
more
adventureous
and
try
new
beers
from
shorts
and
other
brewers
this
is
a
pale
yellow
color
extremely
fizzy
and
well
carbonated
smells
are
cereal
grains
and
light
hops
maybe
a
light
white
grape
smell
taste
is
crisp
and
very
well
balanced
finishing
with
a
decent
bite
from
the
hops
this
is
light
and
very
drinkable
which
im
sure
is
exactly
what
it
is
intended
to
be
light
scent
of
grain
that
was
the
predominant
player
here
no
matter
how
you
looked
at
it
once
you
got
past
that
it
was
easy
to
pick
up
a
nice
hint
of
banana
in
there
as
well
as
the
tiniest
bit
of
fresh
grass
like
hop
aroma
wheat
and
grain
profile
that
was
very
well
balance
and
very
crisp
and
fresh
a
tad
musty
or
maybe
even
bready
in
the
flavor
however
this
was
very
crisp
and
had
a
nice
balance
to
it
up
next
were
some
more
subtle
fruity
flavors
nice
touch
of
banana
in
here
to
brighten
it
up
a
bit
with
something
a
bit
tangy
as
well
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
overall
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
cookout
beer
if
you
just
want
to
sip
something
you
dont
need
to
think
about
too
much
i
would
say
it
was
alright
but
i
probably
wont
have
another
mouthfeel
was
great
very
light
bodied
i
could
definately
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
experience
while
not
within
style
this
is
nonetheless
a
very
enjoyable
brew
and
is
recommended

just

true

fair
enough
and
truer
than
miller

can
ever
hope
to
be
this
is
maybe
my
third
craft
pilsner
ever
so
im
definitely
not
an
expert
on
the
style
but
this
one
might
be
my
least
favorite
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
didnt
really
have
the
crispness
i
was
looking
for
very
drinkable
it
has
that
crisp
clean
taste
that
leaves
you
wanting
a
little
bit
more
i
could
have
probably
finished
the
entire
pitcher
with
not
a
second
thought
i
had
this
on
tap
at
slows
in
detroit
this
week
the
beer
was
clear
and
goldenstraw
colored
maybe
a
little
hazy
with
a
very
thin

the
smell
was
more
malty
than
hoppy

a

clean
the
taste
was
likewise

not

as
id

drinkability
the

it
eminently
quaffable

combined

this

and
would
please
the
masses
at
a
summer
cookout
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
that
showed
obvious
signs
of
good
quality
it
always
cracks
me
up
when
the
miller
lite
commercials
refer
to
their
beer
as
a
pilsner
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
grainy
with
some
soft
grassy
notes
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
decent
it
had
some
light
earthy
flavors
mixed
with
a
bit
of
sweet
grain
with
the
lager
yeast
finishing
up
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
had
a
decent
carbonation
to
it
overall
not
the
best
pilsner
out
there
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
good
beer
to
start
a
night
with
and
move
on
from
there
not
bad
not
great
decent
pils
fairly
refreshing
but
lacking
the
clean
crisp
character
of
the
best
of
the
style
o
overall
not
a
bad
pilsener
pretty
nice
aftertaste
slightly
above
average
taste
starts
with
pale
malt
sweetness
lemony
in
the
middle
with
a
medium
crisp
bitter
close
saaz
is
here
but
muted
mouthfeel
is
pretty

and
drinkability
is
alright
as
well
comes
off
kind
of
dumbed
down
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
depth
in
the
flavors
d
its
not
a
terrible
pils
but
it
suffers
from
simplicity
and
fair
quality
not
one
ill
have
again
overalla
very
nice
pilsner
doesnt
try
to
do
too
much
but
remains
balanced
and
refreshing
a
winner
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
brewed
to
style
so
nothing
exceptional
here
but
its
smooth
and
balanced
the
slight
sweetness
is
really
the
only
drawback
appearance
is
beautiful
golden
yellow
with
a
full
white
frothy
head
that
lasts
a
decent
amount
of
time
laces
nicely
scent
of
citrusy
hops
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
no
aftertaste
lingering
this
reminds
me
of
my
grandfathers
beers
tastes
of
hops
and
lemon
zest
im
going
to
get
another
one
o
ive
had
realy
good
czech
style
pilsners
in
my
life
so
i
know
what
the
pinnacle
is
this
isnt
that
but
this
is
clearly
above
average
especially
in
an
american
pils
well
made
great
price
possibly
the
best
saranac
ive
had
havent
had
one
in
a
while
overall
very
solid
beer
near
the
other
east
coast
pilsners
but
missing
something
o
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
example
of
the
style
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
pretty
standard
czech
style
pils
lighter
and
a
little
more
hoppy
than
its
german
counterpart
saranac
does
a
decent
job
with
this
one
apparently
adding
some
noble
hop
varieties
for
flavor
pours
a
standard
golden
color
and
has
a
small
white
head
smells
more
oppy
than
most
saaz
hops
a
mellow
malty
body
and
vibrant
carbonation
make
this
fairly
drinkable
if
unexciting
hoppy
enough
to
go
in
their
winter
mixer
not
bad
not
great
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
minimal
lace
smells
of
bready
grain
with
a
hint
of
butterscotch
and
earthy
spicy
grassy
hops
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
lacking
enough
hops
sweet
bready
almost
honey
like
malt
with
a
smidgen
of
spicy
hops
medium
body
with
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
sticky
mouthfeel
decent
flavorful
beer
but
not
quite
a
bohemian
pilsner
nice
mouthfeel
crisp
with
a
little
spice
easy
drinking
beer
good
alternative
to
macros
if
you
want
something
good
thats
not
too
intense
o
nothing
groundbreaking
i
prefer
more
hops
in
my
pils
but
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
non
the
less
although
i
would
have
wanted
a
crisper
hop
bite
up
front
it
still
has
enough
of
earthy
floral
bitterness
until
the
sweetness
from
the
pilsener
malt
seems
to
come
in
out
of
nowhere
and
really
balance
it
this
is
my
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
even
with
it
being
a
general
straight
forward
offering
the
fruitiness
builds
from
the
yeast
strain
and
from
some
of
the
hops
although
the
hops
give
more
of
an
earthy
noble
hop
taste
more
than
anything
while
not
quite
as
good
as
the
prima
pils
or
dogfish
heads
my
antonia
i
still
like
this
one
better
than
european
pilseners
bright
sunny
fall
day
and
looking
for
refreshment
this
is
a
pretty
decent
highly
carbonated
to
a
fault
easy
drinker
light
tan
color
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
clean
finish
fairly
hopped
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
higher
priced
but
no
better
pbr
thats
not
a
knock
i
like
pbr
bummer
i
like
skunky
wasnt
in
the
taste
either
rather
plain
high
carbonation
excentuated
the
hopping
and
a
prickly
feeling
but
substantive
taste
profile
was
lacking
light
mineral
and
grain
mouthfeel
bitterness
is
up
whats
the
deal
they
cant
hop
an
ipa
or
pale
to
save
their
life
but
here
they
get
it
right
almost
to
the
point
of
being
on
the
high
end
but
i
guess
i
shouldnt
complain
just
pointing
out
a
weird
phenomenon
overall
a
light
and
refreshng
beer
just
seems
a
little
too
light
makes
it
a
bit
watery
not
too
bad
though
very
light
golden
pour
with
loads
of
carbonation
and
a
little
head
of
white
that
seems
to
stick
on
top
for
just
the
slighest
bit
of
time
aroma
is
light
biscuit
hints
of
grain
touches
of
light
banana
an
spice
taste
is
about
the
same
but
seems
to
be
just
a
touch
off
for
me
not
the
way
it
is
supposed
to
work
for
sure
light
finish
leaves
almost
no
aftertaste
and
it
is
over
before
it
began
o
not
a
fan
i
am
not
a
saranac
fan
and
im
very
touchy
when
it
comes
to
pilsners
and
even
more
so
i
dont
have
an
extreme
amount
of
familiarity
with
czech
pils
so
that
makes
it
harder
but
this
beer
was
not
what
i
wanted
it
wasnt
refreshing
it
wasnt
flavorful
it
didnt
have
a
good
aroma
decent
to
look
at
but
thats
about
it
took
me
a
very
long
time
to
finish
and
i
ended
up
dumping
the
last
two
gulps
down
the
drain
because
it
just
wasnt
worth
waiting
around
for
another
half
hour
to
finish
d
very
drinkable
refreshing
with
just
enough
flavor
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
enough
flavor
to
be
decent
but
it
tastes
somewhat
uninspired
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
prickly
on
the
tongue
it
finishes
crisp
but
leaves
an
uncharacteristic
off
flavor
inside
the
mouth
taste
like
minerals
and
suflur
which
is
not
enjoyable
the
sub
5
abv
allows
it
to
be
easy
drinking
but
i
couldnt
finish
the
glass
let
alone
go
for
another
perhaps
if
this
was
served
mouth
numbingly
cold
i
might
have
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
i
would
not
try
this
one
again
decent
beer
not
the
greatest
czech
pilsner
but
also
not
the
worst
while
this
brew
might
be
clean
and
lagerlike
it
does
not
resemble
the
pilseners
i
have
had
over
the
years
decent
but
one
bottle
was
more
than
enough
no
lingering
aftertaste
this
beer
is
ok
however
this
was
really
great
in
my
minds
eye
this
is
what
an
old
world
beer
would
taste
like
after
taste
was
oily
at
begining
but
quickly
righted
itself
for
a
great
rich
bready
pilsner
with
a
bit
of
caraway
smell
not
a
fan
of
dry
finishes
but
it
really
works
and
i
wouldnt
want
this
too
sweet
anyway
carbination
goes
from
sharp
to
creamy
i
actually
think
its
better
that
pilsen
urquel
i
have
a
feeling
this
would
be
awesome
with
brats
and
hope
this
becomes
an
annual
offering
drinkability
is
pretty
good
crisp
flavorful
for
a
pils
and
looking
good
would
work
fine
as
a
session
beer
or
lawnmower
beer
this
is
what
tripple
hops
beer
should
taste
like
d
i
wouldnt
say
that
this
is
a
world
class
pils
but
its
pretty
darn
good
this
is
the
second
beer
in
a
row
from
saranac
that
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
a
large
amount
of
flavor
with
a
reasonable
abv
if
youre
a
pils
fan
give
this
a
go
real
beer
lovers
would
love
any
beer
meeting
the
standard
of
any
beer
style
exceeding
is
not
necessary
but
a
treat
light
yellow
hue
as
clear
as
a
consommé
you
can
read
the
letters
on
a
dime
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
with
a
thin
very
white
head
nose
is
crisp
and
dry
with
distinct
saaz
notes
bit
of
lemon
peel
and
hint
of
spice
but
on
the
faint
side
mediumthin
body
thick
for
the
style
with
a
moderate
carbonation
mild
sweet
dry
bready
malt
weak
hop
character
dry
finish
slight
hop
bitterness
emerging
but
mostly
bread
very
easygoing
but
somewhat
boring
a
perfectly
drinkable
pilsener
pours
a
clean
straw
yellow
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
dry
malt
and
saaz
hops
in
the
taste
dry
malt
and
a
small
hop
presence
but
quite
malty
for
a
pils
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
malty
aftertaste
ok
decent
pils
but
nothing
too
exciting
d
was
hoping
for
more
did
get
better
as
it
warmed
up
a
nice
easy
drinker
to
start
off
the
1111
ive
really
become
smitten
with
the
saaz
hop
and
the
pilsner
style
lately
and
this
one
surely
did
not
disappoint
definitely
take
your
time
with
this
one
warming
helps
just
about
every
aspect
of
the
beer
except
for
the
smell
which
got
worse
first
sip
is
refreshing
nice
crisp
finish
with
a
detectable
spicy
hop
bitterness
malt
sweetness
is
present
but
mild
there
is
a
bit
of
a
bite
on
the
end
there
is
a
little
bit
of
fruity
flavor
in
the
middle
that
isnt
quite
appropriate
for
the
style
but
that
is
a
relatively
minor
criticism
overall
a
very
nice
beer
good
summer
lawnmower
beer
d
this
is
a
true
pilsner
highly
drinkable
great
session
beer
d
this
one
was
ok
but
it
really
lacked
in
flavor
and
aroma
this
was
a
very
unique
beer
from
an
american
craftbrewer
saranac
it
as
a
wonderful
appearance
for
a
pilsner
with
a
2
finger
head
and
nice
retention
it
surprisingly
tastes
very
much
like
a
germanczech
pilsner
and
if
i
were
given
a
blind
taste
test
would
have
not
guessed
it
as
american
with
that
said
the
taste
left
somewhat
bland
and
could
use
some
bolder
flavoring
for
me
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
d
easy
to
drink
for
sure
but
nothing
special
the
flavor
is
a
disappointment
but
the
feel
and
drinkability
is
spot
on
i
would
never
seek
this
beer
out
but
i
have
no
issues
drinking
it
all
in
all
my
favorite
offering
in
this
formidable
winter
variety
pack
cheers
drinkability
not
undrinkable
not
a
beer
id
be
happy
to
return
to
unless
someone
had
it
as
a
lawnmower
brew
and
offered
me
one
slainte
d
extremely
drinkable
beer
super
smooth
and
crisp
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
and
punch
but
it
is
also
far
from
empty
the
flavor
profile
is
really
nice
and
balanced
overall
especially
the
hops
dnot
overly
drinkable
in
winter
summer
it
would
be
fine
but
i
really
am
curious
why
it
is
in
a
winter
pack
high
drinkability
but
personally
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
glad
its
part
of
the
saranac
mix
but
not
worth
picking
out
at
a
beer
distributor
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
their
winter
season
12pk
at
shaws
pours
a
strawyellow
crystalclear
body
with
nearly
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
bready
with
hints
of
butter
and
cooked
vegetable
tastes
sweet
and
bready
with
a
decent
butter
presence
and
hints
of
cooked
vegetable
toward
the
finish
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
could
afford
to
be
cleaned
up
a
little
but
for
the
most
part
pleasant
and
to
style
solid
light
golden
straw
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
thin
whispy
layering
on
top
of
the
brew
i
notice
some
vegall
aromas
at
first
then
citrus
sweet
malty
notes
some
grassy
hints
in
there
as
well
bitter
lemon
zest
taste
with
some
floral
notes
slight
citrus
and
lightly
sweet
with
a
tart
finish
nice
light
body
with
some
intense
carbonation
high
drinkability
overall
sharp
and
crisp
up
front
with
dryness
throughout
a
higher
carbonation
level
and
a
thinner
body
even
for
the
style
overall
i
would
say
im
not
a
fan
of
this
rendition
not
generally
characteristic
of
saranac
id
venture
to
say
the
light
body
and
highish
carbonation
that
makes
many
saranac
ales
dissapointing
actually
works
with
their
lagers
bohemian
pilsner
is
true
to
the
style
nice
noble
hops
great
balance
not
sure
why
its
in
the
winter
pack
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
grains
taste
is
crisp
grains
are
present
a
touch
of
hops
not
bad
but
nothing
special
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
average
beer
poured
into
a
sam
adams
summer
ale
glass
color
is
straw
yellow
1finger
head
disappears
into
nothing
quickly
and
there
is
no
lacing
whatsoever
okay
so
this
beer
should
be
consumed
immediately
after
removing
from
the
fridge
as
any
warmth
contributes
to
terrible
skunk
no
aroma
just
light
malts
taste
is
clean
light
malts
no
hops
and
not
a
total
palate
killer
but
should
be
consumed
while
ice
cold
the
only
difference
between
this
beer
and
a
milwaukees
best
light
is
that
this
wont
sting
your
mouth
as
much
thats
it
though
d
goes
down
easy
very
clean
and
smooth
one
of
the
high
points
for
a
rather
average
beer
12oz
bottle
and
the
final
beer
ive
reviewed
from
the
12
beers
of
winter
pack
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
minimal
head
no
lacing
aromas
of
malt
and
grains
taste
is
more
of
the
same
of
the
malts
and
grains
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
doesnt
have
much
else
going
for
it
probably
the
least
flavorful
of
the
lot
tastes
slightly
better
than
your
average
pilsenser
d
saranac
has
a
decent
pilsner
here
that
has
good
flavor
and
is
drinkable
its
acceptable
as
a
part
of
this
mixer
just
not
the
best
in
the
pack
d
it
is
a
very
smooth
drinking
brew
but
as
with
most
pilsners
there
just
isnt
enough
flavor
for
me
to
want
to
drink
more
d
i
might
think
about
finishing
the
other
one
in
the
sampler
pack
but
then
again
i
might
not
3
0
d
saranac
cant
help
but
make
boring
easily
quaffable
brews
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
just
an
average
example
of
the
style
not
equal
to
the
top
pa
pilsners
but
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
d
pilseners
are
not
a
style
that
i
generally
like
but
i
got
this
in
a
mix
pack
and
gave
it
a
try
and
was
very
surprised
with
it
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
taste
a
very
good
beer
at
a
good
value
worth
trying
pours
a
faint
yellow
like
straw
the
taste
is
clean
with
a
little
hint
of
hops
nothing
over
the
top
there
is
also
a
hint
of
a
floral
taste
with
a
little
honey
the
smell
is
slightly
floral
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
overall
a
mediocre
beer
is
decent
for
a
pilsner
compared
to
marcos
but
not
as
good
as
other
micros
very
quaffable
and
certainly
a
nice
wellcrafted
example
of
the
original
pale
lager
slight
overuse
of
hops
or
perhaps
a
bit
too
many
minerals
in
the
brewing
water
send
out
a
touch
too
much
bitterness
but
aside
from
that
it
is
a
decidedly
wellbalanced
and
refreshing
bohemianstyle
pilsner
d
a
decent
pilsner
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
ever
seeking
this
one
out
why
does
saranac
put
this
in
their
winter
sampler
drinks
easy
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
drinkability
cant
be
more
than
5
abv
which
is
what
drags
this
one
up
to
a
4
0
its
not
great
its
not
even
really
good
but
its
not
bad
and
its
smooth
inoffensive
light
and
crisp
and
on
the
whole
pretty
easygoing
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
at
a
bbq
or
at
any
plain
ol
summer
day
outside
event
a
decent
beer
drinkability
is
not
very
good
it
just
didnt
seem
to
measure
up
to
some
of
the
other
good
european
pilseners
ive
had
drinkability
decent
beer
not
what
youd
expect
in
a
winter
brew
mix
pack
but
a
change
is
good
not
my
favorite
pilsner
but
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
d
crisp
but
the
sour
flavor
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
i
got
this
in
a
mixed
pack
but
would
not
buy
this
one
on
its
own
steve
d
i
cant
really
say
that
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
is
certainly
drinkable
this
would
be
good
for
one
of
those
nights
where
you
want
a
decent
consistent
beer
without
having
your
tongue
assaulted
by
a
barrage
of
strong
and
unique
flavors
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
really
isnt
enough
to
it
that
would
make
me
want
to
drink
it
again
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
and
a
nice
traditional
take
on
the
style
true
to
style
more
expected
in
the
summer
pack
but
nice
to
have
a
refresher
in
the
winter
to
change
things
up
pours
a
nice
clean
and
clear
golden
color
with
just
a
bit
of
head
and
minimal
lacing
crisp
and
malty
scent
if
a
little
skunky
decent
taste
crisp
and
clean
but
little
in
the
way
of
esters
spice
or
anything
else
besides
malt
goes
down
fine
although
theres
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
it
wouldve
been
an
excellent
macro
lager
but
is
just
a
passable
pils
d
pretty
solid
no
alcohol
taste
which
is
nice
goes
down
easy
taste
a
very
nice
balance
of
malts
and
grains
almost
honeylike
without
the
color
mild
overall
a
decent
pilsner
and
probably
onje
of
the
better
choices
from
the
saranac
winter
mixed
12pack
liked
this
one
a
lot
the
aroma
is
malty
with
noticeable
grassy
hops
the
appearance
is
pale
gold
with
an
average
foamy
head
that
leaves
lace
in
the
glass
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
which
means
its
simple
but
effective
and
tastes
good
the
palate
is
just
right
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
has
no
funk
or
negative
qualities
whatsoever
poured
this
into
a
12oz
pint
glass
and
formed
a
12
head
that
disipated
quickly
leaving
very
light
lacing
around
the
edges
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
color
is
straw
yellow
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
very
soft
with
flowery
hops
and
sweet
yeasty
bread
the
flavor
is
also
soft
almost
buttery
in
feel
with
sweet
notes
in
front
and
at
the
side
of
the
palate
and
a
soft
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
bit
in
the
nottoodry
finish
theres
a
citrus
note
also
in
the
finish
that
i
didnt
detect
earlier
i
think
i
prefer
this
czech
style
pils
over
the
german
styles
and
their
more
aggressive
hop
rates
so
ill
have
to
rate
this
pretty
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
in
fact
i
think
ill
have
another
right
now
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
retention
but
a
nice
lacing
lots
of
bubbles
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
body
is
light
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
not
a
bad
representation
not
a
worldclass
pilsner
but
not
bad
either
should
be
added
as
a
regular
in
the
summer
pack
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
quick
fleeting
moderate
carbonation
rises
and
falls
in
seconds
the
swallow
comes
and
goes
without
much
to
talk
about
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
i
am
floored
at
the
similarities
here
to
budweiser
unless
youre
perfectly
happy
with
a
very
simple
safe
example
of
this
style
that
does
not
showcase
the
ingredients
effectively
look
elsewhere
d
looks
good
and
smells
good
but
falls
flat
in
all
other
areas
an
honest
attempt
at
the
style
and
far
from
drain
pour
but
not
a
brew
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
too
many
other
quality
czech
pilsners
to
choose
from
d
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
czech
pils
style
easy
drinking
and
light
is
seems
like
it
should
be
in
their
summer
pack
not
the
winter
pack
d
as
with
most
beers
of
this
style
very
drinkable
d
not
too
heavy
for
more
than
one
but
not
flavorful
enough
to
even
want
to
finish
your
first
12
ounce
bottle
part
of
saranacs
12
beers
of
winter
sampler
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
average
it
smells
like
bready
malt
and
a
tiny
bit
of
grassy
hops
to
me
it
smells
more
like
a
macro
lager
than
a
traditional
pilsner
but
the
aroma
is
clean
and
not
offensive
at
all
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
bready
malt
grain
and
a
little
bit
of
grassy
hops
it
does
finish
nice
and
crisp
mouthfeelbody
is
light
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
have
a
few
of
these
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
pilsner
i
would
pick
something
else
however
it
is
worth
a
try
as
far
as
pilsners
go
this
is
a
great
example
it
might
not
be
the
best
looking
but
definitely
something
that
stands
up
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
but
the
maltiness
could
have
been
a
bit
more
robust
in
the
taste
overall
still
a
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
that
they
include
it
in
their
summer
offerings
as
opposed
to
the
winter
mixer
as
this
beer
is
a
much
better
summer
beer
probably
the
most
surprising
and
tasty
brew
out
of
the
saranac
winter
variety
this
year
unfortunately
matt
brewing
will
likely
never
produce
it
again
or
omit
it
from
the
variety
next
year
a
clean
and
refreshing
beer
with
a
biscuity
pilsner
malt
profile
just
a
mini
hop
snap
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
soft
quite
drinkable
overall
d
this
is
a
nice
czechstyle
pilsner
but
i
think
the
hop
emphasis
probably
puts
it
closer
to
its
german
cousin
nonetheless
it
is
a
tasty
beer
and
worth
a
try
very
sessionable
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
w
a
thick
pillowy
white
head
that
quickly
settles
leaving
little
lacing
in
my
pilsen
glass
not
much
of
a
smell
hints
of
steely
grain
and
some
grassy
hops
taste
is
a
bit
thin
as
well
starts
out
well
w
a
crisp
hop
bite
combined
a
bready
malt
backing
then
quickly
petering
out
finishes
well
however
slightly
dry
and
light
bodied
brew
plenty
of
carbonation
leaves
a
creamy
feeling
on
the
tongue
a
quaffable
brew
for
sure
not
a
stand
out
pilsner
but
not
a
bad
on
either
mfd
thin
bodied
and
pretty
easy
drinking
not
nearly
enough
flavor
to
want
another
good
mouth
feel
a
bit
thin
but
all
pilseners
are
people
who
like
the
style
will
love
this
effort
as
with
all
pilseners
drinkability
is
the
strength

light

beer
very
easy

although
my
bottle
seemed
slightly
overcarbonated
longneck
from
the
12
beers
of

pack
served
into
an
oversized
pilsner
glass
brilliant
light
golden
in

off
with
a
subtle

close
medium
in
body
with
a
fairly
smooth

a
great
drinking
and
tasting
lager
to
mix
in
with
some
of
the
more
typical
heavy
and
dark
beers
of
winter
crisp
and
clean
with
a
noticible
noble
hop
quality
a
surprising
addition
to
the
winter
12
but
a
crafty
move
on
saranacs
part
i
think
definitely
one
of
the
best
efforts
ive
seen
from
saranac
and
pretty
tasty
regardless
of
the
season
it
pours
a
golden
clear
with
a
inch
and
half
head
that
disipates
very
quickly
to
nothing
almost
no
carbonation
smells
very
dank
i
am
not
to
good
yet
with
the
ingredients
yet
a
very
sweet
taste
goes
down
very
smooth
i
got
this
in
a
holiday
pack
and
i
wouldnt
buy
this
if
sold
on
its
own
pours
a
super
transparent
golden
orange
hue
with
a
medium
size
head
that
vanishes
quickly
and
leaves
only
a
thin
net
of
foam
only
small
clusters
of
slow
rising
carbonation
attempt
to
support
the
head
something
is
off
with
the
nose
way
too
much
malt
sweetness
going
on
as
well
as
a
subtle
herbalgrassy
hop
character
which
in
actuality
should
the
focus
too
large
in
body
to
rival
the
drinkability
of
its
true
czech
brethren
sweet
caramel
malt
corn
husk
and
only
a
subtle
burst
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
overall
im
disappointed
i
guess
i
expected
a
more
crisp
and
lively
interpretation
of
the
style
d
my
favorite
pilsner
so
far
the
label
was
right
this
beer
does
indeed
beg
to
have
another
taste
and
im
quite
upset
that
ive
gone
through
both
the
bohemian
pilseners
in
my
winter
sampler
two
for
two
so
far
saranac
very
impressed

i
feel
the
same
of
this
beer
my
previous
pilsener
experience
being
concerned
with
miller
lite
had
blacklisted
this
style
for
me
its
back
on
the
list
baby
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
a
real
nice
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
for
sure
quite
drinkable
to
me
as
any
well
crafted
pilsener
is
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
a
medium
body
crisp
and
smooth
i
really
enjoy
how
hoppy
this
beer
is
and
i
could
easily
drink
quite
a
few
very
sessionable
and
solid
beer
here
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
to
drink
and
having
a
few
in
a
row
doesnt
bring
out
the
alcohol
out
of
a
mixed
twelve
pack
this
beer
was
a
straw
gold
color
that
displayed
perfect
clarity
the
head
was
two
fingers
thick
offwhite
displayed
mediocre
retention
and
left
some
bands
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
dry
grainy
and
bright
bursting
with
pilsner
malt
and
floral
hops
to
the
point
of
being
perfumelike
the
first
flavors
that
hit
me
were
clean
pilsner
malt
with
hints
of
biscuit
and
a
semisweetness
similar
to
an
apple
hints
of
lemon
and
yeast
good
mouthfeel
light
bodied
and
very
dry
as
per
the
style
a
great
american
example
of
a
czech
pilsener
and
quite
refreshing
drinkability
highly
drinkable
and
generally
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
lacing
the
smell
is
light
of
some
malt
and
hops
with
some
yeasty
notes
the
taste
follows
suit
some
light
hop
and
malt
flavor
with
the
yeast
notes
following
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
light
and
smooth
nice
carbonation
good
balance
in
flavor
not
powerful
but
gets
the
job
done
this
is
an
easy
drinker
a
good
pilsner
an
enjoyable
beer
d
not
too
bad
especially
for
a
saranac
pilsener
i
find
their
beers
normally
have
a
distinct
aroma
and
flavor
but
it
isnt
present
in
this
light
beer
drinkability
what
can
i
say
i
grew
up
loving
pilsners
and
this
one
is
a
perfect
stab
at
the
style
you
can
tell
the
hops
in
this
have
been
carefully
selected
and
the
refreshing
yet
drinkable
finish
of
this
makes
this
an
excellent
beer
should
it
be
included
in
a
winter
seasonal
pack
no
but
this
is
still
a
good
brew
and
a
good
stab
at
pilsner
styling
from
saranac
it
is
very
similar
to
the
saranac
kolsch
with
a
firmer
bitterness
this
brew
is
new
to
the
saranac
christmas
mix
the
brew
poured
to
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
fair
sized
white
head
that
broke
down
quite
quickly
light
grain
notes
come
through
giving
that
seem
to
give
a
slight
toasted
aroma
mixed
with
saaz
hops
the
flavors
are
very
clean
the
malts
come
out
very
nicely
and
give
a
nice
toasted
feel
to
the
flavor
also
the
break
at
the
end
of
the
hops
while
very
subtle
is
very
good
seems
to
have
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
what
is
nice
about
this
pilsner
is
that
when
compared
to
the
imports
that
i
have
has
this
seems
so
fresh
this
would
be
a
good
brew
to
include
in
the
summer
pack
andor
just
have
this
one
in
612
packs
like
the
pale
ale
etc
as
i
would
get
this
brew
for
the
summer
months
very
refreshing
had
both
from
the
winter
12
mixer
dont
think
id
search
it
out
again
but
im
not
much
for
pilseners
anyway
tastes
a
lot
like
most
bohemian
pilsnersczech
pilsners
ive
had
pours
dark
yellow
with
good
clarity
and
head
i
feel
like
i
should
be
drinking
about
a
liter
of
this
out
of
a
stein
in
order
to
get
the
full
experience
of
this
but
its
not
bad
in
a
pint
glass
i
never
know
what
really
makes
for
the
rich
flavor
unique
to
bohemian
pilsners
it
tastes
like
a
mixture
of
corn
and
diacetyl
not
unpleasant
but
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
beer
people
would
think
it
is
a
flaw
even
if
its
part
of
the
style
still
tasty
nonetheless
bit
of
a
soapy
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
grainyness
in
the
nose
not
bad
i
get
a
little
sick
of
that
super
rich
taste
after
a
bit
though
appears
a
pale
straw
colored
golden
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
forms
thick
and
dwindles
slowly
leaving
thin
speckled

around

glass

flowing

flavors
have
a
crisp

with
ample

very
solid
mix
of

and
hops
not
an
over
the
top
czech
pils
but
if
this
sold
in
sixpacks
it
would
be
really
popular
more

the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to

the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
light
czech
hop
aroma
its
crisp
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
an
easy

pilsner

flavor
that
goes
down
quick
and
finishes
clean
with
a
bit
of
saaz
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
well
brewed
pilsner
it
tastey
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
pils
d
near
perfect
drinkability
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
nearly
flawless
good
stuff
this
is
an
above
average
highly
drinkable
beer
for
sure
why
is
it
in
a
winter
seasonal
i
have
no
idea
but
thats
besides
the
fact
definitely
tastes
like
a
bitburger
aka
straight
out
of
europe
kinda
pilsener
so
its
nice
and
tart
and
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
with
a
nice
sparking
gold
color
great
beer
but
they
should
include
this
in
the
summer
sampler
in
the
future
this
is
my
first
review
and
its
fitting
that
the
beer
should
be
saranac
because
my
heart
has
a
fondness
for
this
brewery
that
cannot
be
surpassed
especially
when
it
comes
to
the
annual
winter
variety
pack
each
of
the
new
offerings
in
the
08
edition
is
worthy
of
honorable
mention
dont
miss
the
vanilla
stout
and
india
brown
but
the
bohemian
pilsner
warrants
singular
praise
this
beer
is
exactly
what
i
might
have
hoped
for
but
not
necessarily
what
i
was
expecting
and
you
know
what
i
mean
if
you
have
followed
saranac
through
its
various
iterations
the
appearance
is
pleasingly
golden
more
european
than
american
and
the
semisweet
maltiness
is
well
balanced
with
hops
evident
in
both
taste
and
aroma
i
have
to
say
if
given
the
choice
between
this
beer
and
a
well
known
import
version
of
the
same
im
choosing
saranac
two
out
of
three
times
and
if
that
isnt
a
glowing
review
of
a
saranac
offering
all
in
all
a
tasty
albeit
highly
hopped
example
of
the
style
i
could
definitely
see
myself
buying
sixers
of
this
if
it
were
available
in
that
package
this
beer
poured
a
corn
yellow
with
a
singlefinger
head
that
lasted
a
little
while
the
smell
pretty
tight
with
some
grains
and
malts
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
malt
that
is
quickly
cut
by
some
very
nonaggressive
malts
that
leads
to
a
very
clean
and
crisp
finish
the
carbonation
and
lightness
of
the
beer
makes
for
a
very
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
coincidentally
this
also
makes
the
beer
very
drinkable
moreso
than
most
saranac
offerings
d
fairly
drinkable
and
light
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
pairs
well
with
assorted
sushi
and
other
fish
nice
beer
although
not
entirely
memorable
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
disappears
before
you
can
get
started
smells
of
metallic
and
bad
yeast
just
a
very
off
smell
tastes
stale
spiced
water
with
a
sour
aftertaste
its
just
not
a
good
beer
tastes
like
a
miller
or
coors
light
but
worse
stay
away
it
actually
feels
pretty
good
creamy
and
fizzy
but
overall
this
is
a
very
weak
offering
a
slightly
better
lager
with
some
okay
hops
i
should
probably
evaluate
it
at
face
value
because
if
this
was
made
by
pabst
im
thinking
i
would
probably
be
singing
its
praises
but
for
saranac
its
disappointing
d
easy
drinker
that
has
the
taste
that
is
very
true
to
style
just
a
tad
to
heavy
to
be
as
refreshing
as
others
the
beer
is
mild
crisp
mediumbodied
and
very
refreshing
a
nicely
drinkable
brew
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
gold
hue
with
a
egg
white
one
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
of
fluffy
clouds
some
thin
lace
remains
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
hundreds
of
tiny
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
bready
malt
and
saaz
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
toasted
grains
candy
sugar
and
faint
grassy
hops
in
the
aroma
as
well
very
crisp
smelling
pils
crisp
noble
hops
up
front
on
the
tongue
with
a
sweet
biscuity
flavor
to
follow
lightly
toasted
grains
and
a
floral
hops
midway
with
a
clean
finish
of
pale
malts
with
a
dusting
of
pepper
light
to
medium
body
with
a
creamy
smooth
feel
a
lively
carbonation
to
an
extremely
drinkable
lager
pleasant
surprise
from
saranac
for
sure
one
of
their
better
offerings
ive
had
as
of
late
a
unique
style
to
put
in
a
winter
seasonal
mix
12pack
but
im
not
complaining
the
first
out
of
six
is
a
winner
hopefully
the
rest
follow
suit
cheers
to
saranac
keep
up
the
good
work
d
wow
by
far
saranacs
best
offering
i
have
sample
over
15
of
their
beers
over
the
last
few
years
and
this
one
surpasses
them
all
which
isnt
always
saying
much
it
presents
a
classic
pilsener
with
generous
malting
and
straightforward
but
bold
saaz
hopping
a
really
excellent
pils
saranac
needs
to
make
this
available
yearround
it
stands
up
to
victory
prima
pils
and
clipper
city
small
craft
warning
for
overall
quality
a
decent
pilsener
that
i
consider
to
be
highly
drinkable
not
too
sweet
and
the
emphasis
on
hops
is
a
big
help
i
enjoy
it
notes
this
is
a
new
brew
for
saranac
and
a
new
addition
to
there
winter
mixed
12
pack
