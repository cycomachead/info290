yup
another
crap
beer
trying
to
compete
effort
noticed
but
keep
trying
by
the
way
add
some
hops
a
cheap
high
abv
miller
not
too
bad
when
you
want
something
cheap
its
miller
nothing
special
here
tastes
like
cheap
beer
great
advertising
bottle
and
good
taste
amber
colour
nothing
special
aroma
has
a
slighty
sweet
corn
smell
tastes
like
a
typical
amber
lager
not
bad
but
has
no
hint
of
hops
high
apv
for
a
inexpensive
price
has
a
nice
golden
color
to
it
usual
cheap
graincorn
smell
but
on
the
taste
its
a
rich
corn
and
malt
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
much
like
a
good
cream
ale
very
very
good
considering
its
from
miller
will
buy
again
this
is
a
very
good
beer
pretty
good
best
of
the
miller
beers
ive
had
higher
abv
and
for
a
lower
price
than
many
others
overall
people
who
enjoy
the
aroma
of
rotten
corn
and
stale
malt
will
derive
amusement
from
miller
fortune
people
who
like
a
beer
that
reminds
them
of
grain
mixed
with
light
metal
will
enjoy
miller
fortune
overall
not
a
bad
addition
to
the
miller
lineup
it
is
not
pretending
to
be
anything
else
besides
a
step
up
from
high
life
mgd
etc
i
would
drink
it
again
but
it
is
not
exactly
a
goto
blah
all
over
only
thing
enjoyable
was
that
it
was
a
higher
abv
than
miller
light
pretty
good
i
found
it
the
best
of
the
miller
beers
ive
had
higher
abv
got
me
buzzed
after
a
few
good
beer
for
miller
to
do
dark
and
high
alc
content
makes
for
a
decent
beer
its
to
me
a
poor
mans
flashy
beer
ill
give
it
to
miller
on
trying
to
venture
out
of
light
beers
but
they
need
alot
more
testing
the
flavor
goes
from
a
dark
lager
to
a
burnt
chocolate
and
hops
it
to
much
going
on
and
throws
flavor
way
off
and
way
to
much
carbonation
packaging
is
cool
though
great
beer
great
price
gets
you
drunk
pretty
quick
not
good
if
you
want
a
mainstream
moderately
darker
beer
pick
something
else
best
miller
product
imho
but
then
again
they
have
a
low
bar
to
begin
with
if
you
cant
find
anything
else
this
is
not
too
bad
a
decent
beer
thats
affordable
there
is
no
way
to
try
and
mask
this
beers
intended
market
this
beer
was
made
for
people
who
like
strong
inexpensive
beers
i
happen
to
like
all
beers
and
depending
on
the
mood
i
might
want
a
cheap
strong
beer
that
being
said
this
beer
is
not
expensive
so
i
will
treat
and
rate
it
as
so
like
other
strong
beers
in
its
category
malt
liquors
high
gravity
lagers
ice
beers
this
beer
is
a
cut
above
the
rest
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
olde
english
and
leffe
blonde
of
course
its
made
at
14
the
budget
of
leffe
blonde
so
please
dont
bash
it
if
you
want
a
better
tasting
strong
beerale
then
go
for
something
like
a
leffe
blonde
if
you
want
a
six
pack
of
strong
beer
for
the
price
of
two
leffe
blondes
than
look
no
further
miller
fortune
will
do
the
trick
kind
of
bias
due
to
my
dislike
of
reds
and
miller
but
a
passable
beer
for
sure
taste
like
beer
with
a
shot
of
vodka
to
me
not
complex
at
all
malt
and
hops
are
muted
by
the
pure
booze
flavor
if
they
threw
in
a
little
hoppiness
this
could
have
been
a
great
beer
it
is
sweet
and
malty
with
no
malt
liquor
ethanol
attack
and
is
still
highly
drinkable
even
after
standing
for
15
minutes
a
notch
above
your
typical
lager
at
a
decent
price
well
this
isnt
half
bad
but
i
reckon
that
i
wont
bother
to
revisit
ive
given
miller
fortune
a
3
5
im
not
much
for
talking
about
tastes
flavors
and
mouthfeel
in
my
reality
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
price
which
in
this
case
is
extremely
affordable
i
wish
i
could
drink
barrel
aged
tripels
everyday
but
i
cant
afford
it
this
beer
isnt
bad
tasting
its
pretty
strong
and
doesnt
give
me
a
hangover
like
cheap
ice
beers
do
i
like
miller
fortune
someone
left
this
in
my
fridge
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
kinda
wish
i
didnt
taste
starts
off
with
promise
and
then
theres
the
nasty
aftertaste
that
fills
you
full
of
booze
and
regret
tastes
like
it
was
filtered
through
a
hobos
sock
this
stuff
was
so
bad
it
made
me
mad
all
i
could
taste
was
the
booze
and
some
sweet
maltiness
but
that
almost
just
tasted
like
sugar
it
tasted
like
barf
and
sugar
combined
this
was
not
good
i
got
it
for
free
but
next
time
i
would
even
drink
it
for
free
and
thats
saying
something
this
beer
is
essentially
the
antithesis
to
refreshing
as
a
proper
adjective
heavy
not
easy
to
drink
and
just
downright
repulsive
to
drink
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
think
back
to
those
first
few
times
you
drank
too
much
beer
and
got
sick
late
that
night
or
early
the
next
morning
then
think
about
that
taste
in
your
mouth
this
beer
is
that
taste
love
this
beer
beer
bros
no
one
drinking
miller
fortune
is
drinking
is
for
the
lovely
taste
but
it
is
very
tolerable
when
compared
to
other
cheap
24oz
beers
it
will
get
you
very
drunk
for
cheap
its
a
cool
looking
can
too
o
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
higher
gravity
version
of
a
miller
product
certainly
not
offensive
but
definitely
not
anything
special
either
decent
enough
that
i
would
not
refuse
it
in
the
future
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
overall
3
66
i
would
buy
this
again
its
decent
and
i
think
it
gets
a
bad
rep
because
its
a
miller
product
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
deserves
a
thumbs
up
because
its
a
miller
product
this
is
a
decent
amber
and
one
of
the
better
macro
ambers
ive
had
in
my
lifetime
nothing
wrong
with
drinking
this
one
its
tasty
and
different
than
the
runofthemill
high
life
or
mgd
o
overall
craft
beer
lovers
should
stay
far
away
however
i
would
recommend
to
miller
light
lovers
it
tastes
like
miller
light
with
a
shoot
of
vodka
in
it
to
get
you
drunk
quicker
taste
is
very
smoothe
not
a
hoppy
beer
but
just
enough
hops
perfect
carbonation
without
a
bite
taste
is
top
shelf
to
yeungling
look
out
though
since
the
alcohol
content
is
strong
and
will
sneak
up
on
you
my
husband
has
fallen
in
love
with
this
beer
he
has
been
a
fan
of
shiner
for
many
years
but
now
this
is
his
preference
miller
fortune
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
head
there
really
isnt
much
of
an
aroma
the
taste
is
full
of
adjunct
flavors
with
some
spice
notes
easier
to
drink
then
other
similar
beers
and
not
as
harsh
overall
it
is
a
step
up
form
most
adjunct
beers
easier
to
drink
and
the
flavors
are
not
as
pronounced
served
in
a
pint
glass
i
got
this
at
heb
in
the
12
pack
i
chose
it
because
i
was
looking
for
something
new
with
a
bit
more
alcohol
than
a
typical
beer
it
is
described
as
a
red
lager
hahahahahahaha
its
dark
straw
kinda
like
urine
when
im
dehydrated
tastes
like
copper
no
head
no
fiz
and
no
flavor
i
drank
four
and
i
am
saving
the
rest
for
guests
and
i
am
going
to
to
the
store
to
get
a
real
beer
picked
this
up
because
butlers
riverside
liquors
in
frederick
was
clearing
a
bunch
out
for
3
99
a
six
i
mean
how
bad
could
it
be
at
7
for
that
cost
well
not
much
to
look
at
for
a
albeit
slightly
bigger
beer
there
was
nothing
to
the
appearance
maybe
a
little
more
color
than
a
typical
miller
beer
smell
well
pretty
much
the
same
a
little
better
than
typical
miller
however
it
was
not
bad
reasonably
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
better
than
miller
high
life
which
is
not
horrible
plus
at
almost
7
it
gets
a
little
bonus
overall
especially
if
you
can
get
if
for
4
buck
a
six
i
will
be
stopping
back
by
to
stock
up
on
this
it
is
drinkable
and
i
can
fill
the
fridge
with
it
for
guests
who
do
not
like
beer
snob
stuff
and
if
i
have
to
end
up
drinking
it
or
if
i
am
having
a
quantity
day
giddy
up
this
beer
does
not
remind
me
of
any
mainstream
beer
the
closest
i
can
think
of
is
carlsberg
elephant
if
miller
would
only
add
some
more
hops
this
beer
could
be
a
5
0
instead
of
4
5
as
it
is
a
big
malty
brew
with
a
good
mouth
feel
but
without
the
requisite
hop
nose
and
bittering
hop
level
to
balance
it
i
would
call
its
style
as
maibock
if
i
were
to
give
it
an
international
style
description
miller
please
rethink
the
inadequate
hop
level
on
this
beer
and
add
an
adequate
hop
level
and
you
will
sell
more
i
would
still
be
more
inclined
to
drink
this
than
any
of
the
other
american
pilsner
lager
beers
available
hefty
feel
to
the
bottle
pours
amber
in
color
and
above
average
in
appearance
aroma
is
cornvegetal
and
in
line
with
other
macro
brew
taste
is
also
similar
to
macro
its
a
little
more
malty
given
the
higher
abv
but
most
of
the
sweetness
is
from
corn
underwhelming
taste
with
minimal
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
overall
this
is
slightly
below
average
for
style
7
49
for
a
sixer
with
6
9
abv
i
mean
ill
probably
get
it
again
but
its
definitely
more
about
the
buzz
than
the
flavor
with
this
one
drink
this
beer
as
cold
as
you
can
get
it
because
its
really
awful
it
starts
off
okay
however
it
does
not
hold
its
6
9
alcohol
very
well
at
all
in
fact
you
get
the
distinct
alcohol
taste
when
you
roll
it
around
across
your
tongue
the
next
problem
comes
when
you
swallow
it
you
realize
at
that
point
youre
drinking
a
beer
thats
loaded
with
sweetness
almost
like
a
very
bad
attempt
at
a
cream
ale
my
advice
is
leave
this
stuff
on
the
shelf
for
someone
else
more
adventuresome
to
try
drinkability
this
was
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
its
a
smooth
drinker
nothing
offensive
and
makes
a
laudable
effort
at
following
the
style
guidelines
my
only
criticism
is
that
it
was
light
in
the
ass
but
that
didnt
take
away
from
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
people
are
nuts
i
have
liked
miller
beer
but
this
beer
is
unbelievably
good
try
it
for
yourself
and
stop
trying
to
say
what
you
think
is
cool
just
be
honest
with
yourself
this
beer
is
good
and
at
7
alcohol
you
dont
have
to
drink
a
bunch
to
get
a
nice
buzz
overall
given
light
color
lack
of
notable
adjuncts
and
rich
body
i
viewed
this
more
as
a
euro
strong
lager
overall
not
bad
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
functional
and
not
the
worst
i
have
had
i
still
think
the
best
budget
brew
is
mickeys
so
the
next
time
i
will
go
to
that
overall
hey
its
an
american
macro
beer
what
do
you
expect
this
definitely
does
not
compete
with
craft
not
even
with
coors
third
shift
or
batch
19
but
with
its
high
abv
its
decent
to
get
a
slight
buzz
going
for
cheap
if
you
can
stomach
malt
liquor
miller
missed
the
boat
with
the
marketing
on
this
one
but
not
too
bad
considering
im
not
expecting
weyerbacher
insanity
from
this
overall
not
really
getting
red
ale
here
more
of
an
amped
up
adjunct
lager
the
extra
alcohol
was
not
overly
noticeable
if
you
like
adjunct
products
this
falls
right
in
the
middleonly
with
an
extra
kick
this
beer
completely
surprised
me
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
not
bad
for
millers
attempt
at
a
craft
beer
i
would
have
rated
this
even
higher
compared
to
american
adjunct
lagers
but
beer
advocate
had
it
as
a
american
amber
red
lager
bottom
line
this
is
a
sub
par
domestic
beer
for
your
money
you
might
was
well
buy
some
40s
taste
palate
its
flavor
has
a
firm
grainy
presence
with
notes
of
corn
husk
and
cereal
grain
with
light
grassy
hop
backing
it
up
it
also
has
a
little
sweet
malty
boozy
character
as
well
it
feels
slick
and
full
with
some
fizzy
carbonation
trying
to
give
to
some
lift
off
the
palate
miller
is
tryng
to
make
a
beer
that
is
compareable
to
smaller
market
beers
and
do
an
ok
job
this
beer
has
more
taste
than
anything
else
ive
drank
with
the
name
miller
on
it
if
you
want
to
try
something
new
but
are
afraid
to
leave
the
big
name
beer
companies
give
it
a
try
the
abv
level
is
higher
than
other
domestics
obviously
to
compete
with
bud
light
platinum
but
this
is
a
richer
more
enjoyable
amber
lager
it
actually
reminds
me
of
flying
dogs
amber
lager
this
is
another
glitzy
attempt
from
the
big
beer
companies
to
produce
super
premium
beer
to
compete
with
craft
once
again
a
misfire
this
is
not
tasty
a
little
nicer
than
cheap
malt
liqour
40
oz
black
painted
bottles
would
be
the
only
way
id
respect
this
beer
ok
so
my
buddy
jake
left
two
of
these
at
my
house
and
i
figured
why
not
rate
it
i
could
be
surprised
ok
miller
surprise
me
it
pours
a
slightly
brownish
gold
with
a
loud
fizzy
head
that
dissolves
to
nothing
in
a
matter
of
seconds
the
smell
is
fruit
loops
and
cardboard
i
begin
to
suspect
that
childhood
is
about
to
punch
me
in
the
nads
the
taste
is
bready
grainy
then
ugh
sour
metallic
and
then
sour
some
more
its
like
an
old
tin
sandwich
made
with
infected
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
not
quite
watery
this
is
a
terrible
beer
im
sorry
i
really
wanted
to
give
this
a
chance
but
its
like
they
took
everything
not
objectionable
away
from
crap
beer
then
added
the
parts
from
crap
beer
that
only
your
pretentious
brotherinlaw
likes
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
as
i
drink
both
mhl
and
mgd
i
poured
this
into
a
guinness
pint
sized
glass
the
appearance
is
a
medium
golden
color
a
very
thin
head
with
very
little
lacing
it
had
a
fruity
taste
at
first
then
leaves
an
odd
thick
textured
sour
taste
which
isnt
very
pleasant
glad
i
only
bought
a
six
pack
way
overpriced
too
like
others
noted
they
did
a
good
job
of
covering
up
the
high
alcohol
content
im
not
a
beer
snob
so
let
me
say
that
id
rather
have
a
miller
highlife
over
this
stuff
o
the
fortune
i
see
is
not
very
long
lived
poor
attempt
millercoors
very
poor
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
brown
glass
twelveounce
longneck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
honestly
if
the
higher
alcohol
content
is
what
youre
after
just
get
some
malt
liqour
because
thats
basically
what
this
tastes
like
o
this
is
a
premium
it
wasnt
a
drain
pour
but
it
was
one
and
done
for
me
when
i
asked
the
bartender
if
anybody
else
had
one
of
these
she
said
shed
sold
one
other
bottle
and
they
had
the
same
reaction
her
sample
of
the
beer
also
proved
the
same
bought
this
in
a
12
pack
of
bottles
at
walmart
miller
in
a
brown
bottle
hmm
its
looks
like
a
dark
beer
6
9
alcohol
pours
with
tan
color
head
fades
away
has
very
little
aroma
maybe
some
generic
grain
medium
alcohol
smell
tastes
rather
sweet
for
a
dark
beer
carmel
molasses
something
doesnt
seem
like
a
6
9
alcohol
beer
im
not
a
heavy
drinker
nor
a
dark
beer
drinker
yet
this
went
down
easy
with
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
not
sure
what
miller
is
aiming
for
here
seems
to
be
in
search
of
an
identity
doubt
if
ill
buy
it
again
but
if
youre
buying
this
beer
in
no
way
has
common
attributes
to
their
high
life
or
lite
brand
except
for
its
amber
color
which
is
the
best
part
of
its
appearance
the
beer
has
no
head
and
no
lace
smell
is
weak
not
much
there
taste
is
of
malt
with
some
caramel
and
hint
of
whiskey
mouthfeel
ok
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
which
is
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
it
i
will
not
buy
again
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
the
whole
product
seems
unoriginal
from
the
black
bottle
which
is
reminiscent
of
buds
black
crown
to
trying
to
tap
into
the
spirits
and
craft
beer
markets
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
opretty
disappointed
comes
in
a
nice
package
and
a
cool
bottle
but
its
really
just
a
jacked
up
miller
very
similar
to
what
bud
light
tried
to
do
with
the
platinum
the
only
good
part
about
it
is
the
abv
its
not
too
bad
considering
the
6
9
abv
a
strange
find
with
the
miller
logo
for
sure
i
duly
got
sat
down
with
a
12
oz
bottle
to
see
what
would
happen
when
i
bought
it
my
wife
tried
to
discourage
me
and
she
doesnt
even
drink
well
anything
almost
is
worth
trying
once
so
down
the
hatch
what
is
that
unusual
taste
this
bothered
me
for
quite
a
while
until
i
remembered
it
was
miller
but
with
more
alcohol
well
miller
is
ok
as
far
as
it
goes
and
more
alcohol
how
can
you
lose
with
that
combo
nothing
like
kicking
back
taking
a
quick
bike
ride
over
to
the
local
7eleven
and
grabbing
a
24oz
can
of
miller
fortune
the
only
way
to
try
a
single
serving
of
this
beer
round
these
parts
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
relatively
shortlived
finger
of
lightly
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
hard
water
wet
grains
a
hint
of
toast
and
a
vein
of
sweet
vinyl
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
touch
of
pure
booze
quietly
lurking
in
the
background
unwittingly
throwing
off
the
feng
shui
a
bit
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
crisp
finish
overall
this
is
what
i
expected
a
highergrav
version
of
miller
to
be
like
its
not
all
that
great
but
im
still
drinking
the
can
so
it
cant
be
all
bad
good
for
a
bit
o
slummin
overall
decent
but
a
little
lacking
in
balance
miller
fortune
is
the
best
economic
equation
of
price
vs
taste
vs
abv
it
defies
your
natural
expectations
for
a
beer
that
has
6
9
alcohol
by
volume
its
ethanol
taste
is
remarkably
subtle
the
liquid
has
a
light
crisp
feel
its
light
on
spice
and
flavor
but
it
delivers
what
it
promises
which
is
a
higher
than
mainstream
abv
that
is
potable
for
the
masses
i
dont
perceive
it
as
insulting
personally
its
one
of
my
new
guilty
pleasure
beers
c
the
verdict
not
bad
theres
no
doubting
that
its
a
macrobrew
but
its
a
drinkable
one
the
bourbon
flavor
it
supposedly
carries
evades
my
taste
buds
though
lets
all
face
the
facts
we
wouldnt
have
bought
and
tried
this
beer
if
it
didnt
have
6
9
its
an
aweful
beer
dont
try
to
pull
out
flavors
i
like
the
one
comment
about
all
the
corn
thats
funny
because
thats
what
it
is
i
mean
compared
to
all
macros
it
fits
the
bill
and
with
the
1
9
higher
abv
than
most
macros
its
okay
for
the
masses
its
basically
marketed
to
the
club
crowd
in
their
early
twenties
its
marketed
as
classy
and
has
a
higher
abv
that
bars
can
charge
78
bucks
a
pint
all
the
while
guys
with
way
too
much
cologne
and
hair
gel
think
theyre
drinking
something
great
in
their
futile
attempt
of
bringing
home
a
girl
drinking
pina
coladas
yeah
you
know
it
i
had
to
try
it
because
i
pretty
much
drink
every
beer
but
just
another
platinum
ripoff
blah
mburn
o
this
beer
actually
suprised
me
it
wasnt
terrible
its
far
from
good
but
it
would
have
scored
higher
if
it
was
categorized
as
an
adjunt
lager
and
not
an
amber
jun1614
b
b
d
can
sampled
on

overall
im
not
sure
what
miller
is
going
for
here
at
best
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
and
doesnt
connect
any
dots
at
worse
its
a
watery
6
9
brew
that
doesnt
really
taste
like
anything
you
want
it
to
o
all
over
the
board
here
i
like
it
and
i
dont
its
way
too
sweet
and
could
use
some
more
hops
it
does
have
some
decent
flavors
but
would
i
actually
buy
it
again
im
not
sure
probably
not
especially
this
giant
sized
can
its
too
sweet
and
odd
for
me
it
did
however
exceed
my
expectations
overall
i
would
say
that
miller
always
does
higher
gravity
lagers
better
than
ab
so
maybe
this
is
just
an
attempt
to
make
a
classy
malt
liquor
its
just
an
amped
up
version
of
adjunct
amber
lager
i
really
dont
see
the
point
in
brewing
these
would
make
a
good
beer
to
boil
some
brats
in
following
a
cantillon
review
with
this
such
is
my
life
24
ounce
can
apparently
the
miller
answer
to
bud
light
platinum
i
must
say
this
is
worlds
better
but
thats
as
far
as
i
am
willing
to
go
on
it
smells
like
college
already
dead
corny
and
sweet
unnecessarily
strong
and
fizzy
as
they
come
somewhat
comical
to
me
i
have
not
had
a
beer
of
this
quality
in
some
time
and
am
reminded
why
i
made
the
switch
to
craft
all
these
years
ago
its
not
horrible
but
its
so
so
bad
compared
to
even
the
most
humble
and
pedestrian
craft
offering
sometimes
i
get
so
lost
in
our
beer
world
that
i
forget
the
vast
majority
of
americans
drink
stuff
like
this
a
commentary
on
our
society
more
than
just
beer
i
guess
but
this
is
utterly
disgusting
in
the
context
of
all
beer
in
the
context
of
bmc
stuff
its
middle
of
the
road
no
detectable
off
flavors
in
it
which
puts
it
ahead
of
at
least
half
of
its
peers
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
too
that
isnt
all
the
way
nasty
but
i
am
left
realizing
that
i
would
have
no
chance
of
finishing
this
can
withotu
vomiting
even
for
money
im
not
sure
i
could
pull
it
off
drinking
should
be
a
chore
and
this
can
of
beer
is
exactly
that
overall
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
overly
sweet
with
little
bitter
balance
seemed
like
a
good
summer
yard
work
beer
but
for
the
price
there
are
better
more
tasteful
options
if
i
had
to
guess
what
the
wort
is
made
of
id
have
to
imagine
ultrafiltered
dregs
of
cream
corn
fermented
with
some
corn
sugar
thrown
in
yeah
its
a
highalcohol
cornfest
and
a
waste
of
perhaps
a
few
hops
this
stuff
is
like
drinking
sweet
alcohol
infused
filtered
corn
juice
with
a
shot
of
co2
absolutely
no
imagination
here
doesnt
miller
realize
there
is
a
grain
called
barley
the
corn
market
would
collapse
overnight
if
miller
went
out
of
business
lol
truly
a
wasted
effort
by
a
major
brewer
trying
to
pass
this
off
as
a
craft
brew
stay
away
o
tried
a
sample
of
this
at
a
local
bottle
shop
about
a
month
ago
honestly
never
thought
id
be
drinking
it
again
then
my
grandma
gives
me
a
sixer
because
it
was
on
sale
and
she
had
a
coupon
so
now
im
just
rambling
my
point
is
miller
wants
you
to
put
this
in
a
tumbler
like
its
some
high
brow
shit
well
of
course
thats
a
crock
you
keep
this
beer
ice
cold
and
you
pound
it
out
of
the
bottle
if
you
maintain
that
approach
then
under
certain
circumstances
it
will
be
okay
thanks
grandma
im
glad
it
wasnt
a
sixer
of
lite
or
mgd
o
this
is
kind
of
like
a
fancy
pants
sofistimicated
malt
likka
while
im
not
a
fan
i
honestly
believe
it
exceeded
my
hideously
low
expectations
as
an
amber
lager
though
it
sucks
even
in
the
world
of
malt
likkas
id
rather
drink
steel
reserve
or
natty
daddy
next
the
body
is
light
but
does
surprisingly
enough
work
its
way
toward
medium
it
doesnt
quite
reach
it
though
crispness
is
fizzy
but
consistent
off
the
rolling
carbonation
and
the
best
i
can
say
is
that
at
least
it
doesnt
get
too
slick
and
it
keeps
up
some
semblance
of
smoothness
o
this
is
bad
but
will
make
people
who
dont
knowlike
beer
think
they
are
getting
a
more
craft
experience
the
place
where
this
is
drinkable
if
pabst
and
yuengling
are
sold
out
and
you
are
going
boating
that
afternoon
spending
a
day
on
the
lake
with
this
wouldnt
be
awful
spending
a
night
by
the
fire
with
your
honey
well
this
would
be
like
adding
robert
goulay
throwing
nuts
at
you
chilling
this
beer
only
masks
the
poor
quality
of
its
creators
i
had
two
just
to
ensure
i
wasnt
mistaken
one
off
the
shelf
into
a
frozen
glass
and
one
chilled
for
two
days
the
fact
that
its
considered
an
ale
is
almost
an
insult
couldnt
finish
either
of
the
i
had
takes
like
crap
black
crown
from
bud
is
so
much
better
thankfully
i
only
bought
one
can
i
tend
to
like
a
little
sweeter
taste
this
is
bitter
no
enjoyment
in
the
drinking
had
to
force
it
down
never
again
it
seems
like
an
experiment
gone
array
back
to
black
crown
btw
if
yer
into
this
style
buds
black
crown
is
a
better
bet
a
bit
less
booze
with
a
bit
more
body
and
mouthfeel
just
for
kicks
i
took
a
gravity
reading
and
it
measured

too
sweet
for
my

did
he
just
flip
this
beer
off
at
the
end
too
funny
this
bottle
was
given
to
me
and
im
happy
for
that
as
this
seems
to
be
just
a
touch
above
so
many
adjuncts
this
is
a
lighttomedium
bodied
ale
with
a
nice
fresh
and
crisp
feel
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
the
malts
really
take
over
this
ale
and
the
mild
bitterness
there
are
some
mild
fruit
flavors
in
its
aftertaste
i

this
beer
is
truly
horrible
i
thought
miller
might
have
made
something
that
was
comparable
to
busch
signature
copper
lager
which
suprisingly
wasnt
too
bad
but
damn
this
just
tastes
like
a
mustier
version
of
busch
or
coors
or
something
slick
mouthfeel
with
the
gross
aftertaste
of
what
i
can
only
describe
as
metallic
corn
cobs

believe
another

the

is
present
as
well
especially
in

i
have
to
ding
it

as
its

not
anything

better
than

for

overall
this
is
pretty
clearly

from

some

a

from

overall
nothing
spectacular
good
average
session
beer
price
is
good
from
a
mixed
six
from
the
tallahassee
trader
joes
overall
i
didnt
really
expect
much
and
didnt
get
much
i
picked
it
up
as
a
sample
of
the
style
but
it
seems
to
be
a
pretty
poor
example
the
supposed
heavy
malt
bill
is
nonexistent
the
verdict
not
bad
much
better
than
the
trader
jose
lager
this
is
trader
joes
affordable
version
of
a
dark
mexican
beer
if
you
like
modelo
negra
and
the
like
give
this
a
try
the
definition
of
average
notes
there
is
hardly
anything
to
this
beer
good
or
bad
for
the
money
you
could
get
drunk
on
worse
overall
drinkability
a
good
and
very
different
red
lager
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
watery
smooth
with
very
light
carbonation
a
medium
almost
chewy
body
and
a
grainy
sweet
finish
middle
of
the
road
in
every
aspect
not
bad
not
great
just
there
and
overall
average
i
poured
this
beer
expecting
bad
at
first
taste
i
thought
it
was
it
also
smelled
sour
which
almost
ruined
my
sampling
dark
pour
with
a
tan
head
that
was
nice
at
first
very
creamy
the
beer
was
a
bit
sweet
tasting
to
me
but
then
leveled
out
i
will
try
again
but
the
beer
was
nothing
really
special
the
body
was
pretty
typical
medium
and
clean
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
ok
not
special
not
terrible
overall
just
kind
of
bland
mehish

taste
is
of

some
nutty

a
slight
metallic
flavor
shows
up
on
the

but
its
not
too
strong
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
taste
wise
but
nothing
all
that
exciting
o
this
isnt
bad
actually
it
has
a
porter
or
brown
ale
feel
with
a
ale
like
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
go
as
far
as
to
say
this
is
abover
average
but
id
recommend
poured
this

a

boring

disappointed
with
the
entire
trader

line
on
to
the
next
beer
prost
dr
drinkable
but
boring
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
its
alright
but
largely
forgettable
o
a
very
good
beer
for
the
price
nice
flavour
no
complexity
but
an
enjoyable
effort
light
and
surprisingly
hoppy
with
a
nice
bit
of
grain
pushed
up
from
the
bottom
the
blend
was
nice
and
light
and
had
a
good
bright
aroma
some
light
fruit
in
the
back
as
well
a
good
amount
of
floral
hops
sitting
in
the
finish
the
initial
flavor
i
picked
up
was
that
of
a
nice
cereal
grain
with
a
touch
of
a
light
grass
mixed
in
this
rolled
into
a
nice
light
fruit
with
a
touch
of
a
pine
like
finish
to
it
it
was
a
nice
bitter
finish
and
a
surprisingly
good
hop
profile
clear
and
dark
brown
color
and
an
off
white
head
smell
reminds
me
of
some
chocolate
and
light
coffee
nequick
like
light
hop
presence
as
the
malt
dominates
with
chocolate
drink
mix
like
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
and
well
carbonated
i
might
drink
this
again
t
its
definitely
nothing
mindblowing
but
its
not
altogether
awful
either
taste
is
cereal
grains
sweet
malts
caramel
and
hazelnut
with
a
hint
of
marzipan
as
well
this
was
an
american
amber
could
have
fooled
me
it
pours
dark
almost
coffee
black
maybe
a
hint
of
red
if
you
hold
it
up
to
the
sun
i
really
liked
the
color
especially
since
it
didnt
taste
as
heavy
or
as
dark
as
it
looked
you
can
taste
the
malt
a
little
sweetness
its
a
very
bold
lager
12
ounce
bottle
best
before

so
its
about
a
month
after
that
no
big

the

from

i
dont

sweet

i
wouldnt

this
one
down
or
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
either
even
for

is

clear
coppery
brown
beer
with
a
thin
bubbly
off
white
head
that
fades
to
a

and
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
roasty

aroma
thats
pretty
chocolatey
its
light
bodied
and
a

its

dark
roasted
caramel
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
leafy

bitterness
tastes
a
little
too
sweet
and
cheap
but
it
is
cheap
light
bodied
and
fairly
drinkable
as
with
most
lagers
like
this
its
much
better
cold
so
dont
let
it
sit
around
too
long
suitable
for
a
summer
cookout
youd
think
trader
would
be
en
español
too
right
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
dark
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
dark
greens
and
light
buttery
biscuits
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
decidedly
light
addition
of
caramel
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
lager
nothing
much
to
distinguish
it
from
everything
else
but
easy
to
drink
and
generally
enjoyable
enough
for
a
niceandeasy
quaff
im
guessing
that
its
got
a
5
abv
d
fairly
crisp
and
refreshing
but
still
has
a
cheap
beer
vibe
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
memorable
but
at
this
price
5
99
a
sixer
it
scores
a
few
points
as
a
viable
session
beer
over
a
bmc
choice
mouthfeel
thin
but
smooth
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
small
shortlived
head
aromas
are
burnt
sugar
and
toasted
malts
but
little
else
toasted
malts
and
tons
of
nuttiness
on
the
palate
make
it
actually
sorta
tasty
it
lacks
any
meaningful
sort
of
balance
from
hops
but
its
surprisingly
good
despite
its
lack
of
depth
drinkability
could
be
worse
some
nice
flavor
going
on
though
a
couple
of
off
flavor
also
make
things
a
bit
weird
not
a
bad
beer
though
d
pretty
low
abv
only
a
buck
a
beer
pretty
good
flavors
what
is
not
to
like
here
worth
a
shot
nice
summer
time
brew
that
is
a
little
different
drinkability
well
its
not
fantastic
but
its
nice
to
drink
its
satisfying
cant
say
i
would
ever
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
but
not
saying
i
would
never
buy
it
again
i
actually
probably
will
mostly
for
the
price
but
if
you
want
a
mediocre
dark
lager
for
a
cheap
deal
this
would
probably
be
it
drinkability
is
also
good
and
is
this
beers
strong
suit
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
with
enough
going
on
to
make
this
kind
of
interesting
as
well
it
pours
a
nice
maroon
brown
with
a
small
head
that
recedes
and
doesnt
lace
much
the
smell
is
light
and
coppery
as
is
the
taste
its
very
palatable
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
theres
a
nice
caramel
apple
tone
but
it
becomes
a
bit
too
sharp
to
be
a
highlight
it
rests
smoothly
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
easily
which
makes
it
a
nice
choice
for
the
price

nice
and

with
a
good

i
recommend
this
brew
and
would
get
it
again
this
is
a
brew
that
would
go
down
well
while
hangin
on
the
boat
or
while
socializing
at
a
picnic
much
like
many
of
these
trader
joes
beers
they
are
just
a
fantastic
value
you
wont
find
your
socks
blown
across
the
room
but
you
will
be
amazed
you
only
paid
a
dollar
for
it
this
beer
is
bad
but
at
the
same
time
it
really
doesnt
stand
up
to
a
majority
of
the
west
coast
small
and
micro
beers
but
at
the
same
time
its
a
cheaper
beer
and
trader
joes
seems
to
go
through
a
lot
of
their
product
very
roasty
on
the
nose
with
notes
of
caramel
and
rot
pretty
dark
brown
with
small
lacey
head
the
taste
is
very
maltcentric
sweet
but
roasty
malt
very
little
hops
seem
present
in
bittering
or
flavor
dept
i
would
say
style
wise
this
is
more
akin
to
a
euro
dark
lager
many
dark
eastern
european
lagers
ive
tasted
were
very
similar
to
this
to
its
credit
though
this
beer
does
have
a
richer
and
more
dynamic
taste
than
most
of
those
beers
it
probably
owes
this
to
higher
quality
ingredients
and
freshness
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
not
bad
for
90
i
paid
for
it
as
a
single
at
trader
joes
the
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
lot
of
biscuit
and
bready
malts
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
lot
of
lighter
malts
no
real
hop
presence
high
carbonation
and
lowmedium
mouthfeel
pretty
basic
lager
here
nothing
special
but
not
terrible
drinkability
average
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
a
subtle
caramel
presence
and
a
hint
of
nuttinesstoasted
grain
on
the
finish

offers
a
light
brown
ale
sense
nice
smooth
feel
unoffensive
yet
unobtrusive
decent
drinkability
and
almost
alelike
one
bottle
of
a
mixed
sixer
i
received
from
my
parents
for
my
26th
birthday
there
is
a
lingering
sweetness
reminiscent
of
a
malt
liquor
but
the
beer
has
a
refreshing
level
of
bitterness
this
is
a
decently
cheap
beer
that
you
could
drink
a
good
deal
of
in
a
sitting
if
desired
drinkability
kinda
impressed
with
this
one
one
of
the
better
tasting
red
lagers
i
have
had
recently
overall
a
decent
lager
with
a
surprising
amount
of
flavor
drinkability
a
negra
modelo
clone
and
a
much
cheaper
one
at
that
i
have
no
sidebyside
comparison
but
this
is
refreshing
enough
and
light
but
balanced
with
flavor
for
6
a
6pack
a
darker
brew
like
this
aint
too
bad
in
the
summer
taste
there
is
a
slight
toasted
bitterness
initially
that
changes
into
a
nice
sweet
malted
flavor
drinkability
not
bad
i
would
buy
this
over
its

as
a
negra
modelo
clone
of
sorts
it
is
a
little
light
in
body
and
mouthfeel
a
vienna
lager
it
may
be
but
not
one
that
really
satisfies
the
pallette
and
makes
me
want
numerous
bottles
malty
slight
caramel
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
other
comments
negra
modelo
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
south
of
the
border
this
cheaper
version
from
tjs
isnt
too
bad
of
a
clone
despite
all
my
negative
words
about
this
beer
it
wasnt
all
that
bad
its
just
that
there
wasnt
much
to
it
you
know
what
i
would
rather
drink
this
over
a
certain
famous
flavorless
clear
bottled
mexican
beer
if
this
beer
has
one
really
good
quality
to
it
its
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
cheap
as
hell
i
only
paid
a
dollar
plus
tax
for
this
beer
if
you
got
a
pocket
full
of
change
you
want
to
get
rid
of
then
think
about
getting
a
single
or
two
of
this
beer
this
is
obviously
a
negro
modelo
clone
and
it
tastes
pretty
much
like
youd
expect
taste
is
malty
with
a
slight
hint
of
some
cooked
vegetable
flavor
i
know
its
sacrilege
around
here
but
ice
cold
with
a
lime
this
one
could
hit
the
spot
with
some
spicy
mexican
food
nothing
too
exciting
but
for
a
cheap
grocery
store
beer
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
dark
but
clear
brown
with
a
good
thick
head
and
decent
retention
lacing
is
about
average
14
inch
12
inch
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
another
sweet
unknown
sweet
entity
fits
the
style
tastes
of
a
strong
lager
with
lots
of
sweet
malt
very
smooth
with
little
aftertaste
low
carbonation
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
smooth
sweet
taste
thats
not
too
strong
this
is
a
good
darkamber
lager
overall
id
definitely
drink
this
again
especially
based
on
the
cheap
price
also
this
is
much
better
than
its
trader
jose
counterpart
premium
lager
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
much
to
talk
about
the
price
is
certainly
right
1
a
bottle
at
trader
joes
drinkabilty
okay
overall
kind
of
a
mix
of
highs
and
lows
the
appearance
is
a
positive
with
nice
lacing
and
a
good
color
the
carbonation
bite
is
way
to
high
and
detracts
significantly
form
the
flavor
the
body
is
very
nice
maybe
a
beer
to
make
certain
you
use
a
harsh
pour
d
refreshing
enough
and
not
bad
tasting
but
there
needs
to
be
more
in
there
another
private
label
mexican
style
beer
from
trader
joes
this
one
however
is
much
better
than
the
mexican
lager
this
one
is
more
in
line
with
negra
modelo
or
dos
equis
amber
thereby
making
the
flavor
profile
less
dependent
on
corn
and
more
on
caramel
malts
from
the
clear
amber
hue
with
the
nice
tan
head
to
the
sweet
aroma
this
is
a
solid
manifestation
of
the
style
the
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
but
is
balanced
nicely
by
the
citrus
like
finish
nothing
objectionable
here
would
pair
well
with
any
of
the
frozen
burritos
at
trader
joes
recommended
drinkability
not
altogether
terrible
and
priced
if
not
for
glory
then
at
the
very
least
for
an
outdoor
sunnytime
gathering
overall
a
great
simple
beer
to
go
with
food
would
also
be
great
for
beer
novices
cheap
too
drinkability
im
going
to
have
to
start
sneaking
these
beers
into
el
farrolito
and
papalote
because
i
prefer
this
to
my
standby
negra
modelo
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
caramel
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
it
reminded
me
of
a
slightly
darker
killians
pretty
malty
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
definitely
a
pretty
good
regular
beer
especially
for
the
price
its
my
first
trader
joes
brew
of
all
styles
so
im
interested
in
how
they
did
with
the
other
ones
i
know
it
says
its
from
mexico
so
it
must
be
crap
but
i
am
quite
surprised
by
this
brew
i
think
it
gives
negro
modelo
a
run
for
its
money
and
if
it
isnt
it
sure
does
a
good
job
of
faking
the
aromas
and
flavors
of
an
all
malt
beer
well
minus
the
caramel
coloring
while
this
is
certainly
not
earth
shattering
it
actually
has
a
better
mix
of
flavors
and
balance
than
many
of
the
usual
trader
joes
label
beers
at
the
price
they
sell
this
at
it
is
almost
a
go
to
bbq
grill
beer
for
those
hot
summer
afternoons
evenings
for
a
buck
apiece
theres
worse
dability
a
smooth
and
unexpectedly
malty
brew
pretty
good
stuff
for
the
low
tj
price
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
too
thin
there
is
some
legitimate
chocolate
malt
flavor
here
but
it
would
be
much
cooler
if
the
texture
had
the
balls
to
stand
behind
it
reasonable
smoothness
and
drinkability
but
hardly
the
most
interesting
or
flavorful
thing
ive
drank
tonight
single
bottle
from
trader
joes
cary
another
pleasant
offering
from
starr
hill
nothing
spectacular
but
well
rounded
and
tasty
i
would
be
happy
to
try
it
again
o
not
terrible
but
not
overwhelming
either
middle
of
the
road
o
average
lager
i
think
yuengling
is
a
better
bang
for
your
buck
here
but
this
is
better
than
bmc
brews
o
not
great
not
awful
a
decent
easy
drinking
beer
but
you
could
definitely
do
better
o
wow
this
will
likely
be
going
down
the
drain
i
dont
normally
like
vienna
lagers
but
this
is
a
real
disaster
easily
the
worst
offering
ive
had
from
starr
hill
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
cheap
glass
stein
nice
medium
amber
color
with
a
good
head
very
little
lacing
not
overly
hoppy
nice
balance
between
hop
and
malt
hints
if
citrus
nice
refreshing
beer
need
to
make
a
trip
to
the
mountains
to
try
this
on
tap
overall
i
think
this
is
an
okay
beer
and
would
probably
be
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
nice
diminutive
amber
lager
with
a
light
hop
presence
that
i
like
very
enjoyable
o
overall
some
hops
little
sweetness
drinks
more
like
a
hoppy
lager
then
an
vienna
drinkable
but
hardly
impressionable
or
near
style
demands
a
3
25
seems
to
nail
every
catagory
here
not
quite
good
but
a
hair
above
average
in
most
regards
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
orange
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
very
nice
looking
for
a
vienna
lager
smells
of
sweet
grain
very
balanced
but
a
tad
bland
tastes
of
barley
lightly
roasted
and
very
slight
hops
nice
for
a
lager
with
some
great
taste
beer
is
carbonated
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
but
is
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
well
overall
an
above
average
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
some
malts
taste
is
the
same
mild
some
grains
and
malts
a
touch
of
sweetness
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
dark
amber
tan
color
with
no
head
at
all
ugly
for
sure
the
beer
smelled
like
beer
nothing
special
however
i
liked
the
taste
it
was
a
sock
knocker
but
it
was
decent
for
no
head
i
thought
it
tasted
fresh
i
will
try
this
again
maybe
on
tap
would
be
good
flavor
is
refreshing
and
relatively
balanced
but
simply
not
that
tasty
a
bit
of
skunk
or
sour
or
something
colors
the
taste
throughout
and
into
the
finish
and
aftertaste
the
texture
is
a
bit
heavy
which
limits
its
use
as
a
lawnmower
beer
something
just
not
right
here
not
doing
it
for
me
overall
i
didnt
like
this
one
very
much
it
isnt
very
balanced
and
is
too
sour
for
my
liking
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
last
one
left
to
review
pours
a
semi
seethru
golden
color
smallish
head
to
it
not
much
at
all
in
the
nose
taste
is
light
to
medium
bodied
pretty
good
mouthfeel
nice
lager
taste
good
balance
with
the
hopsmalts
not
outweighing
each
other
finishes
clean
and
smooth
a
nice
solid
beer
no
outstanding
flavors
but
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
easy
to
drink
but
again
nothing
to
special
good
flavors
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
served
in
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
darker
gold
color
and
hoppier
aftertaste
than
the
average
lager
i
am
a
fan
of
a
slightly
maltier
brew
than
this
but
did
order
a
second
glass
jomo
lager
would
be
a
good
complement
to
a
basic
pubfood
menu
but
it
is
not
a
beer
i
would
go
searching
after
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
lager
ive
had
many
craft
lagers
worse
than
this
to
say
nothing
of
bmc
offerings
d
goes
down
well
definitely
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
burger
for
instance
o
this
is
not
a
particularly
bold
or
interesting
style
and
this
beer
stays
too
close
to
the
low
expectations
for
a
macrobrewery
lager
excepting
the
extra
spicy
and
bitter
hops
the
semidry
and
relatively
full
mouthfeel
also
elevate
this
beer
still
i
found
it
not
flawed
perhaps
but
not
good
or
interesting
enough
to
recommend
to
anyone
except
fans
of
this
style
the
beer
is
a
golden
slight
copper
color
that
is
a
little
hazy
the
head
is
about
12
a
finger
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
visually
present
the
aroma
is
odd
at
first
there
an
earthy
breadlike
smell
that
reminds
me
of
a
basement
there
is
also
a
faint
hops
scent
and
a
malty
tone
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
caramel
and
wheat
bread
a
very
mild
sense
of
hops
while
in
the
mouth
its
slightly
tart
has
a
light
body
and
a
clean
dry
finish
its
decent
i
dont
dislike
it
but
im
more
of
an
ale
guy
o
i
would
buy
this
over
any
macro
lager
any
day
that
being
said
im
disappointed
with
this
beer
a
lot
i
paid
like
15
dollars
for
a
12
pack
and
didnt
get
an
enjoyable
experience
from
it
this
is
one
of
the
local
brewerys
in
va
near
me
and
i
was
hoping
for
better
a
very
middleoftheroad
lager
nothing
outstanding
to
note
but
solid
and
delicious
all
around
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
a
try
and
glad
i
could
try
it
on
vacation
finish
is
crisp
and
bitter
with
a
medium
body
carbonation
is
between
moderate
and
high
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
i
would
readily
seek
out
again
poured
a
murky
orange
in
color
with
a
small
white
fizzy
head
that
was
fully
diminishing
and
had
poor
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malts
with
a
light
citrus
hop
scent
it
tasted
bitter
and
rather
malty
at
first
and
finished
with
a
nice
bitersweet
hoppy
flavor
that
stuck
around
on
the
taste
buds
for
and
average
amount
of
time
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
with
and
creamy
yet
dry
texture
with
a
soft
carbonation
overall
a
great
lager
with
a
nice
mix
of
maltiness
and
bitterness
pours
a
moderately
hazy
redcopper
color
with
a
halffinger
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
exhibits
some
small
white
bubbles
a
bit
of
lacing
afterward
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
bready
malt
plus
a
touch
of
toast
some
mild
earthy
hops
there
as
well
the
taste
has
a
very
pour
showingslight
infection
has
set
in
and
there
is
a
bit
of
an
acetic
presence
very
unfortunate
other
than
that
theres
a
mild
cherryskin
presence
along
with
some
breadiness
in
the
background
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
the
coming
vinegar
takes
over
another
infected
bottle
quite
a
shame
clear
copper
color
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
a
slight
fruit
aroma
maybe
citrus
and
berry
but
otherwise
no
aroma
at
all
light
malt
flavor
mild
with
a
touch
of
floral
and
fruity
hops
very
light
but
smooth
light
bodied
thin
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
but
this
beer
is
pretty
unnoteworthy
in
every
sense
overall
i
dont
understand
how
this
is
classified
as
a
lager
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
from
starr
hill
the
beer
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
very
mild
offwhite
head
that
quickly
becomes
only
a
memory
the
nose
shows
a
character
that
makes
the
beer
seem
more
like
an
east
coast
amber
ale
than
a
vienna
lager
although
i
suppose
there
isnt
a
world
of
difference
between
the
two
styles
fairly
subtle
notes
of
medium
to
mediumhigh
crystal
malt
the
palate
does
indeed
carry
the
maltforward
character
of
a
vienna
lager
german
malt
notes
greet
the
palate
followed
by
a
mild
bitterness
and
a
clean
slightly
malty
finish
overall
the
beer
is
not
poorly
made
but
lacks
any
really
differentiating
character
average
this
beer
is
just
flat
out
weird
bizarre
and
off
putting
how
can
anyone
drink
this
is
beyond
me
mighty
fine
beer
folks
give
it
a
shot
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
in
va
or
elsewhere
nice
looking
lager
to
start
lighter
amber
color
with
1
12
inch
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
lots
of
honey
in
the
first
sniff
of
this
one
slightly
piney
scent
in
the
nose
as
well
as
some
overcooked
veggie
smell
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
tastes
pretty
good
still
noticing
that
strong
honeylike
resemblence
in
each
sip
nice
balance
of
malts
and
pineyearthy
hops
in
this
one
slight
buttery
and
nutty
aftertaste
with
a
medium
body
and
matching
carbonation
a
solid
lager
for
sure
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
i
mentioned
its
not
overly
complex
and
the
fairly
low
abv
makes
it
appealing
as
a
session
beer
assertive
compared
to
many
lagers
but
pretty
tame
overall
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
not
worth
actively
seeking
out
the
jomo
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
cloudlike
foam
head
the
nose
is
mostly
of
oranges
and
a
mixture
of
malt
and
corn
syrup
there
is
some
other
aroma
that
i
would
say
is
almost
akin
to
oregano
it
was
off
putting
the
palate
is
a
bit
of
wheat
flavor
mixed
with
some
sour
citrus
notes
the
sour
flavors
somewhat
ruin
the
malty
goodness
that
should
be
there
the
feel
is
a
bit
flat
on
the
tongue
nothing
too
bad
but
still
not
great
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
overall
it
just
wasnt
that
great
of
a
beer
carbonation
is
spot
on
despite
the
deadness
in
the
glass
mouthfeel
seems
full
bodied
but
so
disapointing
in
that
finish
although
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
amber
lager
it
still
drinks
really
well
and
refreshing
the
way
it
should
be
value
not
terribly
exciting
for
the
9
99
a
sixer
price
tag
id
pass
on
that
maybe
not
a
session
beer
but
certainly
goes
down
easy
smooth
and
refreshing
but
with
a
nice
beery
aftertaste
i
am
a
fan
probably
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
is
good
not
much
of
a
light
lager
drinker
but
would
be
much
better
choice
then
those
mass
produced
lagers
out
there
want
to
thank
merlin48
for
this
sample
md
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
not
really
my
first
choice
in
what
to
drink
nothing
horrible
tasting
just
nothing
noteworthy
i
dont
know
about
the
vienna
lager
label
i
though
this
was
a
great
allmalt
american
lager
or
an
american
amber
lager
its
a
simple
and
delicious
pairing
of
mild
citrusy
hops
with
clean
lightly
toasted
barley
it
seems
like
it
could
have
mass
appeal
while
still
satisfying
beer
geeks
like
myself
yes
i
was
satisfied
overall
this
is
a
solid
lager
worth
checking
out
d
where
this
beer
shines
picked
it
up
at
a
gas
station
where
it
was
the
only
nonbmc
6pack
and
i
daresay
its
far
more
drinkable
than
its
shelfmates
whose
sole
virtue
is
drinkability
d
all
in
all
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
was
pretty
refreshing
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
pale
golden
amber
with
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
that
lingers
for
a
good
while
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
behind
as
well
the
smell
has
a
general
farmhousestyle
funk
behind
it
with
some
wheat
coriander
and
lemongrass
up
front
the
taste
also
has
a
lemony
wheatiness
to
it
the
coriander
weaving
its
way
through
and
a
somewhat
blunt
funky
tartness
cutting
across
it
all
the
body
is
fairly
light
finishes
mostly
dry
and
has
a
healthy
dose
of
carbonation
but
the
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
somewhat
off
funkiness
that
just
doesnt
fit
yummy
after
opening
this
beer
i
decided
i
needed
a
turkey
sandwich
why
well
this
one
has
sorta
a
dill
pickle
attack
to
it
once
you
get
past
this
starr
hill
did
a
good
job
it
is
just
an
odd
first
attack
not
the
first
beer
i
have
had
with
that
as
an
attack
the
jomo
has
a
clean
refreshing
taste
to
it
that
is
quite
complex
but
east
to
drink
this
is
defiantly
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
picnic
in
fact
grab
your
picnic
basket
some
of
this
beer
a
sandwich
or
two
and
a
sexy
woman
good
beer
d
slightly
specialized
craftbeer
that
might
catch
on
with
someone
insession
but
not
one
that
i
would
plan
a
session
around
beer
is
pretty
filling
and
only
angers
me
because
it
seems
incomplete
i
would
switch
beers
after
drinking
this
had
this
while
at
a
party
at
a
hippie
commune
in
louisa
va
a
copper
colour
dominates
while
the
taste
and
smell
screams
of
bready
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
candy
apple
and
even
honey
thrown
in
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
yet
crisp
and
this
is
a
beer
i
would
have
again
pours
copperyamber
with
a
decent
but
very
shortlived
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
grainy
with
a
hint
of
honey
which
strengthens
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
is
solidly
grainy
witha
nice
crisp
honeyish
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
with
little
carbonation
and
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
it
transitions
to
a
slight
stale
sourness
unfortunately
buy
again
no
i
was
originally
scared
to
pick
this
up
off
the
shelf
but
i
was
impressed
in
the
end
pours
a
clear
copper
color
aroma
is
of
malts
and
has
a
slight
fruity
character
a
little
citrusy
there
is
some
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
also
there
is
a
slight
barley
or
malt
sweetness
that
shines
through
poured
into
one
of
the
few
clear
glasses
that
my
parents
have
premier
a
golden
peach
in
the
glass
lovely
little
white
head
constant
slow
motion
circus
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
depths
smells
of
clean
yeast
and
german
malt
faint
earthy
hops
delicious
dry
and
sweet
malt
presence
a
bit
loafy
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
smooth
delivery
make
this
an
easy
quaffer
the
malts
clutch
the
tongue
for
seconds
afterwards
eventually
relinquishing
their
hold
a
fridge
full
of
this
would
be
hardly
disappointing
pours
a

great

great

smells

the

with
an

level
tastes

slight

some

and
slight

overall
fairly
acidic
with
a
tang
when
cold
but
mellows
when
warmed
this
beer
is
much
much
better
at
4550
degrees
than
fresh
out
of
the
refrigerator
their
ipa
is
acceptable
the
stout
is
fine
this
however
awful
drinkability
overall
decent
lager
not
my
style
but
if
i
had
to
have
lager
this
a
decent
selection
poured
into
unibroue
tulip
head
quickly
fades
away
some
sudsy

the

aroma

bready
biscuity
and

yeasty
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
mild
hops
and
moderate
malt
bill
nothing
too
terribly
exciting
but
certainly
a
solid
offering
nice
clean
taste
in
the
best
way
possible
this
is
clean
but
with
flavor
lots
of
beers
taste
clean
in
that
they
have
little
flavor
but
this
is
flavorful
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
very
refreshing
overall
better
then
i
thought
it
would
be
this
was
actually
fairly
decent
and
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
offered
d
overall
not
a
bad
lager
but
nothing
i
would
purchase
again
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
good
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
different
aroma
than
the
typical
vienna
lager
and
that
comes
from
the
hops
used
they
give
some
citrus
notes
to
go
along
with
the
pale
malt
the
flavor
is
a
bit
unusual
as
well
the
hops
give
citrus
and
fruity
flavors
instead
of
the
grassy
and
spicy
flavors
from
the
typical
noble
hops
used
in
this
style
i
personally
do
not
care
much
for
the
flavor
in
this
beer
nice
body
and
carbonation
makes
this
easy
enough
to
consume
and
session
drinkability
a
decent
vienna
lager
not
the
best
not
the
worst
but
still
pretty
good
a
decent
session
beer
drinkability
this
one
can
be
consumed
all
day
long
as
the
flavor
profile
is
enjoyable

not
the

watery
and
body
is
lacking
any
strong
character
had
this
on
a
warm
summer
evening
outside
at
a
bar
on
a
deck
had
nice
color
to
it
a
deep
amber
color
poured
a
lite
colored
head
with
some
lacing
to
it
it
was
tough
to
tell
the
clarity
of
the
beer
since
it
was
outside
they
gave
it
too
me
in
a
plastic
cup
but
from
what
i
could
tell
i
think
the
clarity
would
have
been
good
smelled
fairly
balanced
not
too
hoppy
it
tasted
pretty
good
i
again
not
overly
hoppy
could
tast
some
roasted
malts
to
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
was
very
drinkable
id
get
it
again
or
try
more
from
this
brewery
if
i
had
the
opportunity
drinkability
fairly
high
but
not
very
flavorful
nor
memorable
unfortunately
its
hard
to
rate
this
much
higher
comparing
it
to
others
ive
had
in
this
style
d
not
bad
just
boring
and
lifeless
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
out
again
drinkability
a
great
lager
that
could
be
enjoyed
in
sessions
the
creaminess
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
a
very
pleasant
surprise
of
a
beer
i
would
certainly
revisit
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
and
i
could
see
this
as
a
macrodrinking
friend
converter
this
beer
sort
of
reminds
of
a
somewhat
hoppier
more
flavorful
version
of
samuel
adams
boston
lager
not
bad
at
all
this
one
came
highly
recommended
by
the
new
clerk
at
the
counter
at
carrolltown
liquors
not
disappointing
poured
crystal
gold
to
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
creamcolored
head
that
laced
the
glass
nicely
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
taste
was
a
touch
sweet
but
rich
malt
with
a
pleasant
bitter
aftertaste
nothing
too
complex
nothing
too
simple
just
a
very
nicely
balanced
lager
with
somewhat
more
carbonation
than
expected
a
nice
surprise
this
one
is
a
keeper
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
starr
hill
varieties
new
to
our
area
drinkibility
well
balanced
nothing
outstanding
d
a
very
nice
vienna
lager
from
starr
hill
finely
balanced
and
extremely
quaffable
sessionable
for
sure
this
is
an
underrated
style
in
my
opinion
and
beers
like
this
one
only
make
me
more
sure
of
that
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
shaker
glass
the
lager
appears
a
clear
medium
copper
color
with
about
an
inch
of
bone
white
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
lightly
toasted
grains
and
bread
grassy
somewhat
bitter
hops
sweet
malt
inviting
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
good
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
style
not
bad
this
beer
is
solid
but
definitely
not
the
best
vienna
lager
ive
had
d
nice
drinkable
session
beer
not
overly
flavorful
but
pleasant
and
holds
its
own
in
this
style
category
ive
got
this
beer
on
tap
right
now
in
a
16
keg
in
my
kegerator
it
is
a
surprising
departure
from
the
bottled
version
while
i
do
enjoy
this
va
brew
in
the
bottles
it
was
much
fuller
and
drinkable
from
the
tap
the
carbonation
or
lack
there
of
is
an
issue
that
i
have
noticed
for
a
number
of
starhill
beers
but
overall
this
beer
has
proven
to
be
a
good
choice
to
enjoy
after
work
or
whenever
i
want
to
thank
starr
hill
for
coming
in
to
the
mountain
state
drinkability
every
sip
i
take
demands
another
so
id
say
very
good
what
a
nice
and
solid
all
around
vienna
lager
mouthfeelgreat
tasting
good
body
almost
aleish
medium
hops
and
this
reminds
me
of
blue
points
rosated
lager
a
great
tasting
lager
from
the
south
alright
very
drinkable
not
as
bready
as
expected
and
not
too
sweet
despite
its
fruity
character
something
here
left
me
wantingmaybe
a
breadiermaltier
foundation
wouldve
improved
it
but
overall
a
pleasant
enough
lager
more
flavor
here
than
i
gave
it
credit
for
at
first
and
the
body
seemed
to
grow
a
little
as
i
got
into
it
a
very
tasty
beer
and
id
like
to
try
more
from
starr
hill
could
drink
this
all
night
definitely
enjoyed
this
while
it
was
nothing
spectacular
it
was
a
nice
lager
offering
from
a
good
small
brewery
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
brew
has
good
appearance
and
auroma
but
not
really
a
fan
of
the
flavor
jomo
lager
comes
served
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
bone
white
head
that
dissipates
to
barely
a
glaze
of
white
on
the
top
of
a
slightly
cloudy
light
amber
body
the
aromas
are
malt
up
front
with
a
floral
nose
from
the
hallartau
and
tettnang
hops
the
flavors
start
out
with
toast
mlat
character
then
the
hops
add
a
nice
earthy
floral
quality
which
balance
pretty
well
the
body
is
closer
to
medium
than
most
vienna
lagers
and
helped
out
by
just
enough
carbonation
and
no
more
it
almost
has
a
creaminess
to
it
the
website
claims
4
6
and
i
could
imagine
they
certainly
pack
alot
of
flavor
into
that
4
6
a
quite
drinkable
vl
a
beer
that
rivals
sam
adams
boston
lager
if
you
like
to
support
locals
you
should
probably
grab
a
6er
of
this
over
a
6er
of
boston
lager
i
took
a
sip
out
of
the
bottle
and
its
pretty
good
from
there
as
well
a
good
beer
to
bring
to
a
party
just
barely
sessionable
recommended
solid
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
just
looking
for
a
good
simple
brew
drinkability
a
good
drinkable
brew
not
too
complex
not
too
high
in
alcohol
just
a
good
lawnmower
beer
ive
had
a
few
skunky
or
skunkyesque
bottles
so
be
careful
of
freshness
on
this
one
fresh
though
id
recommend
it
ive
really
come
to
like
the
brews
from
this
local
brewery
this
one
is
no
exception
great
beer
that
i
recommend
you
give
a
go
very
drinkable
nicely
constructed
with
no
glaring
flaws
a
fine
lager
d
very
drinlable
in
any
quantity
any
occassion
poured
lighter
than
your
normal
vienna
lagermore
of
medium
golden
with
a
slight
tinger
of
burnt
orangea
nice
almost
creamylike
head
atop
that
never
completely
settled
wow
the
aromas
a
very
metallic
and
ironlike
honestly
i
dont
think
i
have
had
a
beer
come
close
to
that
before
to
go
along
with
the
iron
quality
there
is
a
pleasant
floral
hop
not
and
a
bit
of
caramel
flavors
are
as
crisp
as
a
cracker
and
quite
dry
with
just
a
hint
of
sweet
dougha
honest
to
goodness
peppery
hop
snap
in
the
finish
this
could
be
drank
all
daythe
aromas
are
one
sided
but
the
beer
is
quite
goodi
love
a
good
vienna
lager
i
havent
taken
the
time
to
really
explore
this
line
given
their
abinbev
association
and
lack
of
singles
but
ive
been
pleased
with
the
two
sampled
so
far
single
bottle
from
whole
foods
reston
notched
as
best
by
january
perfect
carbonation
and
a
reall
easy
drinker
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
really
dig
this
beer
i
had
never
heard
of
starr
hill
until
a
week
ago
but
so
far
all
four
of
the
beers
i
have
had
are
solid
beers
this
was
no
exception
crisp
and
dry
in
the
finish
with
more
grass
in
the
aftertaste
i
could
honestly
drink
this
all
day
and
not
get
tired
of
it
another
winner
d
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
can
easily
imagine
serving
at
a
party
not
really
special
enough
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
a
special
event
though
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
received
a
ciderorange
body
with
a
thick
twofinger
head
that
died
slowly
and
left
some
nice
lacings
while
i
would
say
some
malts
come
through
in
the
smell
i
was
impressed
with
the
springlike
herbal
hops
aroma
and
some
minor
spices
like
pepper
or
clove
not
a
complex
beer
but
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
and
has
some
minor
sweetness
on
the
sides
from
caramel
malt
and
really
packs
a
hoppy
punch
a
dry
backbite
more
akin
to
a
coffee
stout
or
an
ipa
finish
than
a
regular
lager
complemented
this
beer
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
average
head
in
a
pint
glass
a
subtle
malty
aroma
was
present
and
malt
was
the
primary
flavor
with
a
balance
of
hop
bitterness
very
drikablewe
had
several
over
a
couple
of
hours
with
dinner
hope
they
expand
their
range
to
my
hometown
drinkability
is
very
good
this
works
as
a
session
beer
lawnmower
beer
or
with
food
i
would
like
to
see
this
as
a
choice
in
virginia
resturants
its
up
there
with
sa
snpa
and
yeungling
as
an
everyday
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
honestly
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
from
this
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
to
be
a
very
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
oelergud
i
originally
had
this
at
the
norfolk
tides
stadium
triple
a
baltimore
team
it
was
a
nice
choice
in
contrast
with
the
other
options
that
were
available
it
certainly
wasnt
bad
for
washing
down
a
hot
dog
with
all
the
fixins
drinkability
is
decidedly
average
d
mediocre
at
best
this
one
wasnt
very
impressive
and
i
probably
wont
revisit
stick
to
their
amber
pours
brilliantly
clear
orangeamber
with
a
big
dense
offwhite
head
that
leaves
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
aroma
is
bready
malty
with
some
toast
character
and
noble
hops
flavor
is
a
nice
toastymalty
character
with
a
counterpoint
of
sharp
noble
hops
to
balance
it
out
finish
is
toasty
malt
and
bread
crusts
with
some
pleasant
hop
background
body
is
on
the
low
side
of
medium
a
little
hoppy
for
a
vienna
but
a
real
nice
beer
with
lots
of
vienna
toastiness
the
drinkability
is
ok
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
mk
the
body
is
light
with
limited
flavor
this
is
where
the
beers
falls
with
good
flavor
but
limited
body
overall
the
beer
could
use
more
hops
and
body
but
a
good
foundation
d
low
abv
and
clean
full
balanced
flavor
makes
this
a
local
favorite
my
favorite
starr
hill
offering
amber
to
copper
clear
pour
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
not
an
overly
aromatic

a

on

side
the

to
be

with
this
lager
just
enough
and
not

much
first
starr
hill
beer
ive
ever
had
not
too
bad
i
cant
recall
a
beer
of
this
style
that
impressed
me
more
than
jomo
capitals
wisconsin
amber
and
winter
skal
are
good
as
well
it
delivers
an
impressive
amount
of
flavor
a
surprising
hoppy
kick
and
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
in
a
lowabv
package
that
is
ideal
for
sessioning
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
the
rest
of
the
starr

lineup
has
in

a
nice
sweet

malt

is
slick
across

leaving
a
bitterness
in

and
a

in
the

carbonation
is
almost
too
much
taking
away
from
the

an

of

it

deposits
lots

on

it
smells
of

that
are

also
detect
a

the

tells
me
they
used
all

perle

tettnang
the
body
is
medium
with
matching
carbonation
and
a
medium

overall
a
pretty
tasty
lager
but
this
bottle
seems
much
more
american
than
the
first
five
no
matter
its
a
wellcrafted
vienna
either
way
you
look
at
it
i
got
this
23
oz
at
malones
in
lexington
va
it
poured
a
light
brown
color
and
had
a
lot
of
head
about
2
5
fingers
worth
the
head
was
very
fluggy
and
so
was
the
abundant
lace
the
retention
was
nice
and
slow
the
smell
was
sweet
but
a
little
weak
the
taste
was
wonderfully
blended
the
mouthfeel
was
very
very
smooth
this
was
a
solid
brew
d
great
local
find
not
the
most
knockyoursocksoff
brew
but
a
great
sessioner
with
some
character
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
width
head
smells
like
sweet
malt
the
vienna
malt
is
prevalent
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
and
there
is
some
subtle
hop
flavors
as
well
taste
is
clean
with
no
noticable
offflavors
good
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
vienna
lager
from
one
of

favorite

the
combination
of
the
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
makes
for

og

on
tap
at
the
brewpub
it
could
be
slightly
maltier
it
has
little
in
common
with
other
vienna
lagers
but
that
was
the
style
stated
at
the
brewpub
love
the
beer
the
problem
comes
with
the
inconsistancy
in
the
flavor
an
okay
beer
i
guess
the
taste
is
the
main
downfall
i
think
its
past
its
prime
the
aroma
is
holding
up
pretty
well
but
the
tasty
is
pretty
nondescript
an
easy
drinker
i
am
drinking
it
out
of
a
samuel
smith
pint
glass
it
has
nice
amber
color
very
little
carbonation
and
no
lacing
which
i
dont
mind
cause
i
hate
scrubbing
my
glass
it
has
a
bit
of
a
skunked
smell
with
just
a
hint
of
that
fermented
smell
a
belgian
would
have
it
tastes
like
almost
nothing
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
this
but
it
tastes
almost
like
any
old
amber
then
nothing
not
after
taste
at
all
you
know
how
if
you
drink
diet
coke
the
taste
goes
away
so
you
drink
more
then
no
taste
so
more
and
then
more
until
you
know
it
the
bottle
is
gone
i
need
another
beer
d
it
is
drinkable
based
on
a
certain
very
nice
aspect
of
the
flavor
it
is
not
a
complete
or
tremendously
inspiring
offering
but
it
has
a
serviceable
quality
or
two
o
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
beer
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
maybe
an
infection
maybe
just
a
combination
of
an
old
poorly
made
beer
with
some
dms
either
way
this
is
down
there
with
some
of
the
least
enjoyable
ones
ive
had
this
was
a
dumper
this
is
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
the
flavor
is
a
bit
unbalanced
between
malty
and
hoppy
bitter
and
sweet
its
also
a
bit
overcarbonated
its
not
bad
but
at
this
time
of
year
im
looking
for
a
more
balanced
marzen
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
large
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
light
grain
not
much
else
tastes
of
roasted
grain
that
has
a
great
body
for
this
beer
and
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
beer
seems
a
tad
overcarbonated
but
this
light
bodied
beer
still
goes
down
really
smooth
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
im
really
disappointed
with
this
one
starr
hill
is
a
sentimental
favorite
since
its
fairly
local
but
this
one
just
isnt
that
good
i
think
they
would
have
been
better
off
brewing
a
more
traditional
marzenoktoberfest
style
rather
than
a
kind
of
generic
amber
lager
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
while
not
super
flavorful
and
rather
light
it
is
a
great
choice
for
a
nice
session
brew
overall
drinkable
but
not
memorable
this
would
be
a
great
stepup
for
a
bud
drinker
who
wanted
to
head
towards
a
mild
pale
ale
i
would
call
this
halfway
between
the
two
o
the
more
beers
that
i
have
from
starr
hill
the
less
i
think
of
them
as
a
brewery
there
is
nothing
especially
exceptional
about
this
beer
the
sticky
mouthfeel
makes
it
not
particularly
drinkable
and
the
taste
of
cereal
grains
is
reminiscent
of
a
mass
produced
lager
its
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
neither
the
taste
or
smell
stand
out
as
anything
special
drinkability
well
an
oktoberfest
should
be
repeatable
for
a
good
part
of
the
day
right
i
could
do
that
but
other
than
that
theres
not
all
that
much
to
recommend
it
the
price
is
okay
but
there
are
equally
worthy
beers
of
the
same
style
that
are
less
expensive
i
doubt
that
id
buy
this
again
d
its
very
drinkable
unfortunately
its
just
not
very
good
has
some
mild
sweetness
and
hint
of
bready
crackery
malt
theres
actually
some
light
fruitness
here
almost
bordering
on
an
off
sourish
character
floral
hoppiness
does
make
an
appearance
in
the
finish
and
the
aftertaste
does
suggest
that
this
is
indeed
a
märzen
in
the
big
scheme
though
this
falls
short
of
being
even
a
decent
festtype
bier
its
still
drinkable
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
thnx
bro
1408
o
not
my
favorite
marzen
just
kind
of
misses
the
mark
on
this
one
a
little
less
sweetness
and
a
stronger
malt
presence
is
what
this
brew
needs
for
starr
hills
sake
im
hoping
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
o
goodish
beer
mediocre
compared
to
some
of
starr
hills
other
offerings
very
drinkable
not
recommended
but
id
have
another
once
again
a
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
taste
is
also
malty
refreshing
a
touch
of
caramel
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
brew
o
fairly
smooth
and
a
drinkable
beer
i
might
have
another
but
i
doubt
i
will
purchase
a
sixer
or
more
the
crack
glug
was
music
to
mine
ears
and
produced
two
tawny
fingers
of
dense
bubbling
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
very
malty
sweet
much
more
so
than
yuengling
lager
to
which
a
previous
reviewer
compared
it
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
not
quite
creamy
and
with
a
pleasant
melange
of
flavors
on
the
tongue
ranging
from
an
initial
sugary
sweetness
to
an
herbal
mintiness
and
back
again
finish
was
more
sweet
than
anything
else
and
i
think
that
the
constant
onslaught
of
malt
would
be
too
much
for
me
to
cansider
inclusion
in
my
cooler
well
i
have
to
say
i
was
expecting
better
from
this
starr
hill
offering
but
then
lagers
are
harder
to
dial
in
than
the
average
ale
they
have
a
way
to
go
with
this
fest
beer
and
i
hope
they
are
in
the
process
of
tweaking
it
would
i
buy
more
of
it
not
much
of
an
option
where
i
am
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
lager
and
if
it
was
more
available
i
could
definitely
see
myself
putting
some
on
ice
once
in
awhile
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
much
better
than
it
is
if
packaging
was
a
scoring
category
i
would
have
given
this
beer
at
least
one
high
mark
it
is
over
priced
for
what
you
get
i
think
i
would
have
rated
it
higher
if
it
was
priced
like
it
tastes
id
pick
a
can
of
yuengling
over
this
beer
and
would
compare
them
fairly
equally
it
is
not
bad
just
made
to
make
you
think
its
a
craft
micro
brew
and
its
a
boring
lager
purchase

notched

the

golden
to

with

thinnish
white

that
shrinks

but
leaves

good
balance
of
citrus
and

grainy

flavor
with

some

but
this
beer
is
more
oriented
towards
the
malt
crisp
mouthfeel
and
light
body
d
a
lackluster
fall
seasonal
from
a
normally
above
average
brewery
this
is
lightly
flavored
and
too
thinastringent
to
be
very
enjoyable
you
wont
miss
much
by
avoiding
this
one
although
its
far
from
bad
d
it
is
drinkable
based
on
a
certain
very
nice
aspect
of
the
flavor
it
is
not
a
complete
or
tremendously
inspiring
offering
but
it
has
a
serviceable
quality
or
two
drinkability
a
belowaverage
oktoberfest
with
starr
hill
being
a
fairly
local
brewery
for
me
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
beer
this
really
isnt
that
good
ill
have
to
hold
off
on
getting
more
of
these
until
next
year
to
see
if
it
gets
any
better
pity
this
one
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
color
with
a
fast
fading
half
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
smell
is
a
bit
sour
as
if
any
hops
that
were
in
this
beer
had
already
gone
wrong
i
think
it
may
be
the
burnt
biscuit
flavor
in
there
there
are
hints
of
orange
zest
fronting
the
slight
malt
aroma
the
flavor
is
of
orange
zest
and
not
a
fresh
one
at
that
the
maltiness
that
i
expect
to
see
in
an
oktoberfest
is
totally
not
here
until
the
aftertaste
this
isnt
the
worst
oktoberfest
but
it
sure
as
hell
isnt
the
best
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
do
it
some
justice
but
overall
id
go
elsewhere
for
my
fest
beers
this
is
the
last
sixer
i
bought
before
leaving
the
nova
area
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
pale
apricot
topped
by
about
a
halffinger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
peanuts
buttercream
and
a
touch
of
orange
the
taste
seems
to
initially
lean
in
the
direction
of
an
increased
amount
of
orange
but
this
then
dovetails
into
a
heavy
dose
of
buttery
biscuit
with
a
generous
amount
of
sweetness
tossed
on
top
what
hurts
this
thing
is
that
the
orange
doesnt
really
leave
once
the
maltiness
enters
what
results
is
in
effect
a
cupcake
whose
stump
is
an
orange
slice
honestly
it
would
be
fine
if
this
were
done
in
phases
but
together
it
just
doesnt
seem
right
the
body
is
a
heavyish
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
watery
feel
oddly
enough
despite
the
slightly
awkward
flavors
this
thing
spitefully
retains
a
decent
amount
of
drinkability
it
may
not
be
the
best
ofest
ive
had
but
its
certainly
not
the
worst
either
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
isnt
good
it
was
close
to
a
drain
pour
i
thought
it
might
be
old
but
the
bottle
has
a
best
by
date
5
months
from
now
so
it
must
be
pretty
fresh
something
wasnt
right
at
all
with
it
though
the
flavors
were
not
what
i
expect
for
the
style
at
all
d
we
were
saddened
only
that
we
couldnt
stay
longer
to
have
a
few
more
went
great
with
hard
times
cafes
chili
dishes
and
burgers
fries
even
the
large
salad
d
cant
quite
call
this
an
oktoberfest
but
its
refreshing
nonetheless
the
beer
pours
a
honey
amber
color
with
fairly
good
head
retention
and
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
lightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
ginger
and
pumpkin
bread
flavors
on
the
palate
replicate
the
nose
pretty
closely
in
this
one
dimensional
albeit
inoffensive
lightly
sweet
beer
the
flavors
drop
off
pretty
quickly
in
the
finish
and
the
beer
is
almost
watery
at
the
end
drinkability
is
ok
though
a
bit
more
flavor
would
be
appreciated
mehhh
d
i
could
drink
more
i
just
have
other
stuff
id
rather
drink
right
now
not
up
to
the
competition
i
tasted
this
with
victory
fest
dogtoberfest
dominion
fest
id
drink
it
again
although
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
d
hmmm
seems
like
this
beer
wasnt
totally
thought
through
thanks
jeff
its
getting
to
the
end
of
the
ofest
beer
season
so
i
figured
id
grab
this
one
today
poured
a
clear
lighter
shade
of
bronze
with
a
nice
one
finger
tight
white
head
that
was
gone
pretty
quickly
aromas
of
caramelvanillaand
toasted
grain
mainly
a
light
sharp
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
annoyingflaovrs
were
really
mild
with
some
residual
caramel
sweetness
and
that
toasted
grain
againthe
flavors
were
very
light
a
pretty
average
beernot
one
to
seek
out
d
hardly
a
carnival
really
didnt
have
much
fun
with
any
part
this
beer
lackluster
in
most
every
category
its
not
even
worth
a
try
my
sincere
hope
is
that
the
purchase
before
feb
was
actually
for
2009
not
2010
which
would
explain
some
things
though
i
know
my
buddy
metalmonk
just
picked
this
up
weeks
ago
and
i
received
earlier
this
week
many
thanks
for
the
try
jeff
but
ill
pass
next
time
but
thanks
for
the
prewritten
apologies
below
threw
a
couple
of
these
into
a
couple
different
trade
boxes
as
a
bonus
the
other
day
theyre
already
on
the
way
good
thing
ive
already
traded
with
the
recipients
a
few
other
timestheyll
forgive
me
i
hopebut
guys
i
am
sorry
the
feel
is
crisp
and
moderately
carbonated
decent
body
it
has
some
weak
points
but
the
flavor
is
right
where
it
needs
to
be
nice
filling
bready
taste
some
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
but
it
finishes
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
sweet
malty
goodness
theres
a
slight
sour
note
on
the
back
end
but
its
not
offensive
in
any
way
i
didnt
have
the
highest
expectations
for
this
but
this
was
better
than
i
thought
a
nice
goto
for
the
fall
its
not
too
bad
to
drink
and
you
could
probably
drink
many
of
these
but
im
not
sure
youd
want
to
overall
this
was
not
a
very
good
beer
and
one
i
wont
revisit
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
okay
it
tastes
fine
but
not
excellent
try
it
out
not
the
best
marzen
but
i
could
have
another
one
d
moderate
to
high
i
prefer
a
more
flavorful
octoberfest
but
this
one
could
be
had
over
and
over
again

pits
and

if
you
had
to
choose
youd
say
its
more
malty
than
hoppy
but
really
its
a
wash
some
mocha
and
bread
more
than
the
nondescript
white
citrus
and
dried
lawn
grass
notes
just
not
much
going
on
light
to
mediumbodied
possesses
a
big
carbonated
swirl
in
the
mouth
a
handy
way
of
disguising
the
fact
that
theres
not
much
here
either
some
bitters
and
brine
sun
dried
lemon
peels
and
more
dried

the
malts
are
like
an
aftershadow
you
can
just
make
out
the
general
contour
but
no
depth
in
fact
watery
would
be
one
way
of
putting
it
even
after
focusing
harder
on
each
successive
sip
it
is
not
any
easier
to
find
a
flavor
to
describe
empty
finish

pours
a
beautiful
clear
amber
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
with
decent
retention
lot
of
bubble
action
visible
smells
of
sweet
malts
toffee
tastes
good
but
nothing
in
particular
stands
out
except
biscuity
malts
to
be
honest
its
a
bit
bland
for
oktoberfest
but
its
medium
body
is
perfectly
carbonated
definitely
drinkable
good
all
around
beer
and
just
what
im
looking
for
in
this
style
i
could
drink
it
all
day
d
to
me
this
is
another
very
nice
beer
from
starr
hill
a
good
fall
follow
up
to
their
summer
of
love
will
be
buying
more
very
soon
mouthfeel
is
rich
enough
for
the
style
drinkability
is
pretty
good
if
you
are
looking
for
a
nice
crisp
malty
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
pitcher
of
this
stuff
but
wouldnt
go
looking
for
it
as
an
oktoberfest
beer
either
drinkability
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
from
starr
hill
its
not
that
this
is
an
undrinkable
beer
its
just
really
really
average
beer
and
definitely
wont
be
a
goto
marzen
for
me
despite
my
overwhelming
obsession
w
local
drinking
shame
d
not
starr
hills
best
offering
but
not
a
terrible
take
on
a
marzenstyle
lager
lacking
anything
to
elevate
it
into
the
province
of
really
good
this
is
nonetheless
an
beer
that
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
clear
faults
at
4
0
and
darkened
but
still
a
true
lager
in
bite
and
feel
its
a
solid
session
for
its
intended
seasonand
certainly
a
good
changeofpace
sort
of
sixpack
it
can
be
pricy
but
the
taste
is
definitely
worth
it
i
stocked
up
a
lightweight
winter
beer
that
promises
more
in
the
looks
and
aroma
than
what
it
ultimately
delivers
the
flavor
is
pleasant
but
very
subdued
while
the
body
likewise
comes
across
rather
weak
and
lifeless
yes
theres
a
decent
lowkey
grainpeachhop
combination
going
on
and
the
low
abv
would
makes
this
a
decent
enough
sessionable
winter
offering
but
overall
it
lacks
depth
and
punch
for
a
winter
beer
drinkable
but
pretty
flat
smell
and
not
very
flavorful
great
tasting
easy
drinking
lager
would
definitely
try
again
smooth
malty
flavor
not
dry
finish
corn
smell
reminds
me
of
a
more
complex
version
of
pabsy
blue
ribbon
so
to
sum
up
the
beer
app
needs
an
alarm
and
this
beer
is
ok
justification
seems
like
such
an
intriguing
request
but
anyway
the
beer
is
really
nice
it
does
everything
it
attempts
to
do
very
well
its
an
amber
lager
that
tastes
like
an
amber
lager
and
i
find
that
noteworthy
and
admirable
like
a
slightly
smoother
long
trail
ale
strange
aftertaste
plastic
like
nothing
i
would
revisit
yard
sale
is
an
apropos
name
for
this
beer
its
pretty
much
junk
that
uinta
is
selling
to
whomever
will
take
a
chance
on
it
technically
this
beer
smells
like
budweiser
and
tastes
like
a
lager
but
with
a
much
darker
hue
if
youre
into
lagers
this
might
be
somewhat
interesting
but
it
will
be
a
lot
more
expensive
than
your
typical
lager
me
im
not
a
fan
like
a
bud
light
clone
that
costs
twice
as
much
avoid
i
was
anxious
to
get
started
so
i
went
with
an
aggro
pour
initially
backing
off
only
when
the
pseudocascade
began
to
create
so
much
head
that
i
had
to
back
off
in
fact
i
got
a
small
amount
of
overflow
as
a
result
the
upshot
was
three
solid
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
persistent
retention
color
was
a
deep
copper
srm
17
22
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
cool
minty
quality
but
i
was
expecting
spices
or
some
such
from
a
winter
beer
hmmm
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
minty
with
a
caramel
malt
undertone
nice
but
not
really
wintry
finish
was
semisweet
and
pleasant
but
there
is
no
way
that
i
would
risk
a
horrific
skiing
accident
for
more
of
it
overall
like
most
of
these
beers
its
hit
or
miss
and
i
really
dont
like
this
one
i
am
sure
this
would
appeal
to
low
abv
lovers
but
i
see
nothing
winter
about
this
lager
i
could
mow
my
lawn
while
drinking
this
beer
if
it
werent
winter
i
do
think
uinta
could
become
more
creative
with
this
one
however
i
would
buy
it
again
as
uinta
makes
the
best
beers
in
utah
imo
it
was
overall
very
standard
and
a
little
boring
but
it
has
enough
taste
to
go
back
and
give
it
another
try
in
the
future
this
would
taste
refreshing
after
a
day
on
the
ski
slopes
amber
red
with
an
orangish
hue
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
respectable
thick
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
that
left
a
ladder
of
sticky
lacings
down
the
glass
toasted
malt
earthy
grain
and
bready
aromas
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
thin
oily
feel
upfront
followed
by
assertive
tangy
carbonation
through
the
middle
caramel
and
toasted
malt
flavors
with
tangy
herbal
hops
through
the
middle
that
taper
near
the
end
finishes
cleanly
with
a
light
bready
grainy
aftertaste
nice
foany
head
atop
amber
colored
clear
beer
aroma
is
interesting
a
little
smoky
and
spiced
with
bocklike
maltiness
a
little
husky
flavor
is
very
lagery
with
yeast
and
spice
pretty
decent
and
interestingly
festive
dirty
tasting
earthy
and
rustic
a
decent
beer
of
equal
quality
malty
but
tastes
like
im
drinking
it
out
of
a
straw
of
dirty
pennies
that
are
a
decade
old
there
is
flavor
both
good
and
bad
that
seem
to
battle
it
out
on
the
pallet
i
cant
disern
which
one
wins
the
fight
as
im
torn
from
sip
to
sip
the
alcohol
is
low
at
4
0
so
this
is
swiggable
if
youre
looking
to
keep
pace
with
the
bud
light
drinkers
at
an
event
but
want
something
with
a
little
more
substance
id
naturally
assume
the
taste
improves
the
more
you
drink
but
i
have
a
tough
time
kicking
the
filthy
copper
aftertaste
im
not
going
to
rush
back
to
get
this
beer
but
its
comparable
to
say
a
sam
adams
light
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
doesnt
pop
out
with
flavor
creative
label
that
beckons
to
a
50s
retro
look
with
a
skier
taking
a
dixie
on
a
downward
slope
its
snowing
as
i
write
this
and
theres
a
crackling
fire
in
front
of
me
id
suggest
enjoying
in
a
simular
fasion
light
brown
beer
with
nearperfect
clarity
biscuity
aroma
with
some
toffee
smokeyfaint
notes
biscuitycaramel
taste
with
a
slight
metallic
tang
to
it
very
dry
finish
not
terribly
fascinating
but
hey
it
tastes
good
and
makes
you
want
another
nice
to
see
a
winter
beer
that
is
also
sessionable
o
its
an
ok
beer
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
not
a
disappointment
either
the
4
0
abv
makes
it
sessionable
but
i
dont
think
it
would
hold
my
interest
all
night
overall
an
easy
drinking
and
rather
flavorful
brew
for
only
a
4
abv
brew
a
nice
session
winter
style
lager
o
overall
a
pretty
linear
experience
nothing
that
entices
you
to
have
another
unexciting
a
bit
bland
mundane
and
boring
yawn
a
yard
sale
that
is
sure
to
see

12oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
retains
with
a
creamy
look
that
drenches
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
fresh
and
citrusy
with
a
touch
of
spice
a
firm
bready
presence
sits
along
the
back
while
a
touch
of
earthy
must
hangs
on
the
edges
the
taste
has
a
crisp
and
spicy
bitterness
along
with
some
associated
earthy
citrus
flavors
this
is
well
balanced
by
a
backbone
of
tight
and
toasted
bready
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
clean
and
crisp
feel
very
tight
in
the
profiles
and
body
this
was
a
very
flavorful
and
hugely
drinkable
lager
with
those
noble
hops
in
particular
giving
this
a
spicy
festive
feel
that
is
perfect
for
winter
ill
be
seeking
more
of
this
out
next
time
around
how
can
you
not
love
this
label
the
beer
on
the
other
hand
not
so
much
nothing
really
special
about
this
amberred
pours
clear
and
bright
tastes
of
slightly
weak
malt
and
too
citrusy
i
was
expecting
something
more
bold
and
roasted
a
little
caramel
on
the
finish
but
it
doesnt
stay
with
you
pretty
average
and
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
sorta
like
the
dude
on
the
skis
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
grains
and
malts
taste
is
crisp
mild
malts
grains
just
a
touch
of
hops
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
o
no
reason
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
again
tons
of
flavor
for
a
lager
and
a
very
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
id
pick
it
up
again
overall
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
surprisingly
flavorful
beer
for
a
4
offering
a
bit
one
noted
and
underwhelming
because
of
the
advertisement
of
a
winter
beer
but
i
will
easilygladly
finish
my
6pack
but
wont
seek
it
out
anytime
soon
overall
not
bad
the
lager
flavors
are
more
mild
but
it
does
get
fairly
crisp
nice
malts
hops
are
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
too
similar
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
overall
but
a
bit
maltier
and
less
hoppy
and
less
lager
like
this
isnt
a
bad
session
lager
it
has
a
decent
though
mild
flavor
and
it
has
tremendous
drinkability
there
isnt
much
to
separate
this
from
other
beers
of
this
style
except
that
it
doesnt
have
many
of
the
off
notes
of
a
macro
this
would
be
a
great
stepping
stone
beer
for
any
macro
lover
looking
to
get
into
craft
a
well
done
amber
lager
suited
nicely
for
winter
without
being
a
big
stout
or
porter
bottled
on
date
11162012
about
9
weeks
old
a
tasty
brew
though
if
it
was
cleaned
up
a
bit
it
would
be
nothing
short
of
great
still
worth
a
go
and
definitely
one
ill
revisit
each
winter
o
nice
beer
nose
is
underwhelming
but
the
flavors
are
deep
something
pleasantly
drinkable
for
the
colder
months
notes
a
good
all
around
offering
from
uinta
very
drinkable
anytime
of
year
cheers
a
pretty
mild
beer
but
delivers
a
lot
of
different
flavors
i
especially
like
the
use
of
malts
here
in
a
lower
abv
lager
even
though
i
only
bought
one
it
would
have
been
easy
to
down
2
or
3
in
a
sitting
more
spice
would
have
made
this
more
along
the
lines
of
a
winter
warmer
or
wassail
but
instead
its
just
a
beer
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
wood
that
goes
along
with
a
cold
winters
night
by
the
fireplace
this
isnt
worth
seeking
out
but
getting
stuck
with
a
few
of
these
isnt
bad
either
if
you
love
a
good
holiday
beer
to
kick
back
with
o
there
is
really
nothing
special
about
this
beer
so
i
would
not
recommend
seeking
it
out
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
kind
of
average
in
my
mind
with
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
but
not
sure
i
would
want
to
have
a
bunch
of
these
as
i
want
something
with
a
little
more
complexity
yard
sale
is
a
normal
beer
a
straight
up
american
amber
traditional
in
the
sense
ive
been
getting
back
to
my
roots
lately
and
just
digging
on
simple
styles
more
and
more
i
like
the
back
and
forth
yard
sale
has
a
nice
dark
bronze
semi
brown
look
with
the
color
and
a
frothy
inch
of
off
whitetan
bubbles
up
top
typical
lager
look
a
nice
dose
of
european
hops
earthy
grassy
a
caramel
base
some
grain
bold
and
to
the
point
a
lager
taste
is
a
refined
amber
a
fuller
body
not
as
watery
than
your
average
yuengling
i
get
some
bread
caramel
some
earthy
hops
and
all
together
malty
not
too
much
else
to
say
here
it
delivers
per
the
style
just
gotta
jump
on
it
fresh
body
is
towards
low
with
a
nice
carb
build
glides
down
the
gullet
a
tasty
beer
simple
and
fresh
tastes
nicer
than
i
initially
hoped
from
other
reviews
by
no
means
stellar
but
its
a
nice
smooth
sessionable
lager
little
bit
of
caramel
and
bread
taste
with
very
subtle
hops
creamy
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
and
a
good
body
ill
enjoy
this
six
pack
and
could
see
going
for
this
every
once
in
a
while
as
an
easy
drinking
winter
lager
i
dont
know
maybe
this
is
much
better
fresh
as
it
is
there
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
here
overall
a
nice
suprise
it
may
be
a
winter
seasonal
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
yearround
bottled
3812
nice
red
color
good
head
smells
malty
grains
lagerlike
i
guess
the
taste
had
a
very
interesting
cereal
flavor
without
being
too
grainy
i
actually
liked
it
overall
it
was
nothing
too
crazy
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
bottle
if
someone
offered
me
another
pours

cleanclear

which
does
leave
some
sticky

the
nose
is
malty
slight
hop
note
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
kinda
sweet
malty
a
little

a
nice
little
brew
worth
checking
out
i
guess
pours
a
bright
clear

with
a
frothy
tan
head
head
is
about
a
finger
and
a
half
high
and
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
nose
kinda
disappoints
not
much
going
on
some
toasted
malts
and
thats
about
it
taste
has
more
going
on
but
still
a
bit
underwhelming
some
nice
fruity
esters
up
front
followed
by
bready
biscuity
malts
mouthfeel
again
was
thinner
than
i
expected
overall
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
expected
a
winter
lager
to
be
a
bit
heavier
and
more
flavorful
it
is
definitely
drinkable
though
finished
the
whole
six
pack
and
woke
up
pleasantly
hangover
free
this
morning
bottle
from
total
beverage
westminster
poured
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
small
lasting
amber
head
aromas
of
carmel
earthiness
and
toasted
malt
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
crisp
flavors
of
carmel
toasted
malt
and
light
earthiness
with
a
crisp
lingering
malty
finish
unimpressed
yeah
its
a
lager
but
this
is
a
bore
oours
a
very
clear
light
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
smells
malty
german
crystal
palts
light
but
no
hop
at
all
flavor
is
the
same
watery
a
bit
but
malt
based
and
very
very
low
key
not
what
id
expect
in
a
winter
beer
even
a
lager
nothing
burley
or
hearty
or
meaty
or
spicy
mouthfeel
is
fine
crisp
and
quaffable
but
overrated
in
my
opinion
nothing
special
here
o
not
bad
but
not
something
to
seek
out
much
better
beers
from
this
brewer

or
website
about
the
abv
opretty
solid
lager
that
is
easy
drinking
and
has
nice
flavor
the
malts
are
the
big
part
of
the
taste
too
with
a
low
nearly
invisible
bitterness
balancing
things
out
at
the
finish
sweet
throughout
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
nice
tan
head
developed
with
good
retention
and
lacing
appearance
was
slightly
hazy
with
a
ruby
copper
color
aroma
was
mild
with
some
malt
notes
taste
had
caramel
and
toffee
notes
with
a
smoky
and
slightly
bitter
finish
medium
mouth
feel
with
a
dry
and
mild
bitter
aftertaste
its
decent
but
has
something
odd
about
it
and
has
almost
a
burnt
tinge
to
it
thank
you
o
overall
a
good
beer
not
a
great
beer
it
has
strong
points
but
one
glaring
week
point
which
is
the
carbonation
ive
had
this
beer
a
number
of
times
and
im
always
perplexed
how
its
a
bit
flat
i
got
my
growler
filled
and
brought
it
back
because
i
thought
i
got
a
bad
batch
the
bartender
poured
it
out
took
a
taste
and
said
tastes
right
to
me
he
then
filled
up
another
growler
and
gave
it
to
me
which
i
quickly
took
home
same
thing
i
just
cant
understand
it
o
really
very
drinkable
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
sure
why
it
got
a
b
but
it
definitely
deserves
a
higher
mark
maybe
this
beer
should
only
be
tasted
from
a
tap
or
growler
but
its
really
good
o
the
beer
isnt
overly
difficult
to
drink
but
could
use
more
malts
and
hops
to
create
stronger
aromas
and
flavors
interesting
tasting
lager
not
a
huge
fan
of
lagers
anymore
its
weird
considering
yuengling
lager
and
miller
lite
are
the
beers
that
got
me
into
beer
muddy
creek
is
certainly
not
horrible
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
gateway
for
someone
trying
to
get
into
beer
in
general
overall
a
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
lager
very
quaffable
goes
down
easy
but
certainly
a
heavy
lager
than
say
a
yuengling
a
little
tougher
drinking
than
other
lagers
but
worth
it
great
lager
d
the
hoppiness
keeps
this
from
being
a
session
beer
for
me
had
a
pint
at
the
hop
devil
grill
in
nyc
for
6
50
it
appeared
clear
light
brown
with
a
short
offwhite
head
this
beer
immediately
reminded
me
of
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
its
a
bit
lighter
theres
a
mix
of
herbal
and
citrus
hop
flavors
while
the
malts
bring
a
mild
chocolate
cookie
taste
all
in
all
its
a
pretty
tasty
session
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
d
i
could
see
myself
throwing
back
a
few
of
these
any
more
than
3
and
you
might
get
a
bit
fullbloated
though
dont
drink
and
review
again
i
was
impressed
with
this
pale
lager
nice
head
retantion
apprance
was
a
nice
darker
yellow
smell
was
pleasing
and
taste
was
hoppy
and
smooth
i
got
to
say
this
is
a
good
lager
i
enjoyed
every
sip
great
brew
when
you
sit
dow
nat
the
bar
try
this
first
and
you
will
be
pleased
d
decent
overall
could
work
as
a
session
beer
me
ill
pass
till
they
change
the
hops
effect
d
i
could
definitely
drink
back
to
back
to
back
beers
if
only
the
beer
was
a
little
more
desirable
this
beer
was
definately
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
mind
pouring
a
second
glass
for
myself
this
poured
a
very
dark
brown
out
of
my
growler
ironically
enough
like
a
muddy
creek
it
had
a
small
white
head
with
fast
retention
and
decent
lacing
nothing
too
overwhelming
the
smell
was
very
malty
and
earthy
almost
like
old
beer
while
this
may
seem
unappetizing
it
had
me
intrigued
since
i
respect
and
admire
the
reputation
adn
brewing
style
of
this
brewery
the
taste
did
not
disappoint
again
an
earthy
muddy
taste
was
very
evident
the
mouthfeel
was
not
typical
of
this
brewery
which
kind
of
caught
me
by
surprise
it
was
alittle
thinner
than
what
ive
been
accustomed
too
from
defiant
overall
a
nice
and
smooth
easy
going
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
i
received
a
corked
and
caged
bottle
from
a
trade
with
a
ratebeerian
this
thing
had
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
head
took
a
while
to
settle
down
the
color
was
a
ruddy
brown
the
smell
was
stinky
like
a
muddy
creek
the
taste
was
a
standard
lager
taste
to
me
decent
beer
but
i
couldnt
get
past
the
smell
having
read
most
of
the
reviews
and
being
brand
new
to
this
there
isnt
anything
i
can
add
that
hasnt
been
said
copperorange
color
quick
to
fade

little
to
no

nice
easy
to
consume
lager
not
fancy
just
reasonably
good
unfortunately
it
appears
as
though
the
lion
brewery
has
decided
to
halt
its
production
of
their
amber
lager
quite
possibly
for
good
from
what
ive
heard
from
numerous
distributors
around
northeast
pa
amber
has
always
been
a
good
seller
aside
from
their
oktoberfest
amber
is
the
only
thing
the
entire
lion
franchise
has
going
for
it
advertisment
is
practically
nonexistent
for
their
products
i
just
recently
tried
susquehanna

lager
and
the
lion
would
be
wise
to
revive
their
amber
pours

away
to
a

with

and
it
went
down
smooth

with

and
a
nice
bite
at
the
end
poured
a
simply
amber
color
with
a

receded
to

a

compare

there
are
certainly
different

here
imo
stands
up

its
pottsville

be
used
in
a
session
quite
nicely
overall
just
an
ok
beer
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
its
worth
a
try
the
price
was
a
little
high
for
the
quality

amber
lager
not

this

i
got
this
in
a

and
this
was
my
least
favorite
most
of
the
others
were
quite
good
this
smells
and
tastes
like

like

most
of
the
other

only
a
very
slight
element
of

hops
are
fortunately
present

underwhelming

ho
hum
but
not
horrible
after
enjoying
their
ipa
pale
ale
previous
to
this
i
was
expecting
some
good
things
here
but
this
ultimately
just
didnt
impress
me
at
all
offnotes
muddled
balance
and
a
lighter
feel
all
left
me
wanting
much
more
from
this
oh
well
i
guess
you
cant
win
them
all
good
for
what
it
is
however
laggers
all
more
or
less
taste
the
same
for
me
give
or
take
a
little
sweetness
at
the
end
of
the
sip
smell
is
remarkable
for
a
lager
though
with
notes
of
caramel
cherries
and
other
fruits
too
bad
it
doesnt
hit
the
taste
bud
with
such
force
this
one
ends
in
a
medium
malty
sweetness
i
dont
find
it
desirable
to
go
look
for
but
it
certainly
is
drinkable
enough
to
drink
if
lager
is
the
only
option
which
it
so
often
is
in
this
day
and
age
drinkability
really
disappointed
with
the
off
flavors
in
this
one
not
recommended
part
of
the
stegmaier
mixed
12
pack
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
not
much
head
or
aroma
to
it
taste
is
light
bodied
has
a
slight
tinge
of
hops
to
it
decent
malt
backbone
flavors
dont
totally
mesh
well
together
with
me
just
average
drinkability
in
my
opinion
amber
ales
tend
to
be
a
boring
style
but
this
ones
lack
of
hops
make
it
even
more
boring
id
have
one
if
given
to
me
but
i
would
in
no
way
seek
this
one
out
rest
of
the
mixed
12
pack
is
quite
good
though
a
dandy
gift
from
rubby
thank
ye
first
of
all
i
had
steg
150
not
the
stuff
pictured
here
as
amber
lager
from
all
accounts
i
could
find
on
line
this
stuff
is
a
vienna
marzen
lager
this
beauty
shows
a
dark
orange
amber
color
hazy
with
a
fair
offwhitelight
oatmeal
colored
head
that
disappates
quickly
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
says
rye
malt
with
a
slightly
minty
edge
sort
of
an
odd
hint
of
alcohol
but
interesting
not
bad
the
flavor
comes
on
with
a
nicer
version
of
that
same
rye
malt
very
grainy
with
an
almost
resinous
feel
and
proper
carbonation
for
a
refreshing
and
tasty
lager
theres
some
orangelemon
citrus
going
on
but
it
just
adds
some
tasteful
highlights
to
the
solid
grain
pleasure
of
this
neat
brew
theres
a
little
tootsie
roll
sweetness
with
a
fairly
clean
tingly
feel
in
a
medium
bodied
brew
very
nice
lager
one
of
the
better
ones
for
me
and
one
to
be
quaffed
freely
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
hops
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
also
a
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fine
quality
beer
d
i
could
seriously
have
a
sixer
in
a
sitting
no
problem
really
enjoyed
it
d
no
a
bad
little
beer
the
abv
is
good
so
you
could
drink
a
few
the
bitterness
made
it
a
one
session
beer
for
me
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
all
malt
claim
there
has
to
be
some
hops
in
here
dvery
drinkable
i
can
easly
drink
more
of
these
than
i
plan
to
good
first
impression
of
stegmaier
i
would
buy
agian
and
will
try
the
porter
for
sure
drinkability
are
you
kidding
me
at
5
99
with
this
much
taste
this
is
the
strongest
part
of
the
beer
if
theres
any
problem
with
this
beer
i
cant
find
it
i
clearly
get
the
lions
house
character
but
i
cant
fault
them
for
that
and
although
i
think
it
would
be
a
real
winner
with
just
a
little
bit
more
malt
and
body
i
cant
argue
against
it
as
it
is
i
find
it
quite
pleasant
and
charming
it
would
be
the
perfect
beer
for
parties
or
gettogethers
where
a
mix
of
drinkers
are
present
theres
enough
here
for
the
initiated
and
yet
its
not
too
much
for
the
newbie
nicely
done
pops
the
top
but
didnt
need
to
i
see
its
a
twistoff
good
sign
or
bad
we
will
see
smells
like
a
macro
red
but
it
does
have
a
bit
more
maltiness
behind
it
pours
to
a
reddishgold
with
a
big
bubble
head
that
recedes
quickly
taste
is
malty
at
the
start
with
a
very
twangy
hop
kicking
in
in
the
middle
then
lingering
while
the
sweetness
fades
i
dont
know
what
hop
this
is
but
im
not
sure
if
i
like
it
with
the
beer
warming
up
a
bit
the
twang
isnt
there
so
much
and
the
god
malty
backbone
transitions
to
a
sweet
dry
hoppiness
that
then
finishes
dry
has
got
to
be
the
lagering
i
guess
i
blew
the
call
expecting
a
red
ale
but
this
is
much
crisper
with
a
much
drier
finish
for
the
style
a
tasty
brew
more
an
ale
man
myself
but
this
works
in
a
pinch
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
pretty
close
to
it
it
looked
good
when
i
poured
it
into
the
glass
but
dang
what
a
weak
offering
thumbs
down
to
botm
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
in
hot
weather
the
price
for
6
pack
is
5
99
in
the
toledo
oh
area
making
this
an
affordable
session
beer
hmm
somehow
i
forgot
to
rate
this
when
i
had
it
earlier
no
matter
as
it
is
quite
a
memorable
beer
and
not
in
a
good
way
pours
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
artificial
malt
flavor
of
the
same
awful
sweet
malt
corn
and
adjunct
flavor
this
is
an
awful
beer
too
sweet
and
artificial
tasting
there
are
much
better
lagers
out
there
no
wonder
it
was
cheaper
than
bud
you
know
that
cant
be
a
good
thing
an
amazing
lager
i
dont
say
that
much
very
smooth
amber
lager
with
a
taste
that
leans
more
to
the
malty
side
than
the
hoppy
light
carbonation
and
smooth
mouthfeel
a
little
light
on
the
hops
but
still
a
nice
easy
drinking
amber
lager
thats
pretty
quality
for
the
price
i
found
this
beer
to
be
way
too
grainy
really
undrinkable
not
clean
at
all
i
was
surprised
it
received
such
high
marks
the
best
part
of
it
was
the
appearance
but
really
who
cares
about
that
the
smell
was
pretty
bad
too
dirty
water
comes
to
mind
rough
on
the
senses
just
a
cheap
lager
imo
d
this
is
very
good
for
the
style
a
malty
sweet
lager
with
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
even
with
easy
access
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
amber
lager
very
often
okay
ever
again
on
the
other
hand
it
does
what
it
was
brewed
to
do
which
ought
to
count
for
something
who
needs
bell
and
whistles
every
time
they
crack
the
crown
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
isnt
anything
too
outstanding
about
this
beer
but
its
a
solid
sessionable
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
picked
up
a
case
from
liberty
bell
beverages
for
about
22
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
short
head
funny
this
beer
is
basically
like
a
wellmade
yuengling
it
tastes
like
a
sweet
caramel
and
multigrain
bread
with
a
bit
of
toasty
toffee
roast
at
the
end
theres
also
a
bit
of
apple
juice
fruit
flavor
and
overall
this
is
an
affordable
and
tasty
lager
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
pint
glass
the
lager
appears
a
crystal
clear
copper
color
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
bone
white
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
nicely
toasted
grain
a
good
dose
of
sweet
caramel
malts
a
bit
fruity
grassy
bitter
hops
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
tasty
all
malt
lager
cant
complain
about
the
price
either
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
botmc
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
massive
white
head
the
aroma
is
faint
slightly
bready
the
flavor
has
sweet
grain
notes
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
brew
is
light
bodied
highly
carbonated
and
is
smooth
drinking
a
decent
summertime
brew
overall
light
and
tasty
very
easy
to
drink
and
an
excellent
sessionable
bbq
or
tailgatig
beer
d
better
than
i
expected
overallan
ok
stab
at
an
amber
ive
seen
far
worse
and
like
all
lion
beers
its
cheap
better
than
my
expectations
overall
a
tasty
lager
that
would
be
very
good
with
a
bit
more
hops
the
beer
much
like
the
gold
metal
beer
thins
out
and
whisps
away
giving
the
impression
of
emptiness
despite
the
bottles
claim
of
allmalt
again
an
ok
beer
that
struggles
for
mediocracy
copper
hue
with
a
light
head
dissipates
into
minimal
lacing
and
a
thin
film
of
white
on
top
smell
is
caramel
with
some
biscuit
taste
follows
smell
with
caramel
being
up
front
some
butterscotch
in
there
too
slight
hop
bitterness
at
first
taste
that
fades
good
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
especially
for
the
20
price
point
beer
its
not
just
a
beverage
beer
is
food
amazing
drinkability
and
i
think
this
truly
one
lager
that
i
would
truly
recommend
for
sessioning
without
compromising
flavor
i
had
been
reading
about
steg
150
and
emailed
the
lion
to
see
if
they
were
selling
a
stegmaier
variety
pack
for
the
holidays
they
werent
so
after
looking
for
it
at
my
local
distributors
and
not
finding
it
i
finally
had
to
ask
a
for
it
they
really
didnt
sell
much
from
the
lion
other
than
lionsead
anyway
it
cost
me
about
23
bucks
in
so
chester
countylater
found
it
for
under
18
at
beermart
in
reading
not
close
too
me
but
i
stop
in
while
in
the
area
now
and
then
the
beer
from
the
cold
bottle
was
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
it
smelled
of
sweet
malt
i
would
put
the
taste
between
yuengling
more
there
and
sam
adams
less
than
sa
it
had
a
sort
of
sweet
stickiness
which
reminded
me
of
a
sam
overall
i
thought
it
was
an
impressive
beer
from
the
lion
it
seems
like
all
of
the
pa
breweries
are
moving
to
more
richer
lagers
ala
yuengling
on
the
downside
i
had
a
hard
time
finding
this
beer
in
lancaster
and
chester
counties
i
am
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
but
this
beer
was
really
enjoyable
taste
is
very
crisp
dry
but
with
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
not
a
whole
lot
there
might
have
not
let
it
warm
up
long
enough
but
it
is
smooth
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
especially
nice
and
cold
an
above
average
and
enjoyable
albeit
simple
beer
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
smells
like
vienna
caramel
malt
and
a
little
metal
some
caramelized
malt
flavor
with
some
light
oxidized
notes
of
cardboard
and
metal
solid
medium
bodied
mouth
feel
with
a
slightly
bitter
hoppy
finish
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
would
probably
taste
much
better
on
tap
in
its
hometown
i
would
be
glad
to
try
it
again
under
those
conditions
a
solid
reliable
amber
lager
received
as
a
trade
extra
from
psycohops
the
12
oz
long
neck
bottle
was
conservatively
adorned
with
a
simple
but
elegant
front
label
and
a
very
informational
back
label
the
beer
itself
was
clear
and
effervescent
deep
gold
rather
than
copper
as
indicated
on
the
packaging
and
the
head
was
one
finger
thick
the
aroma
was
clean
and
malty
with
some
spice
also
present
the
taste
indicated
spicy
floral
hops
and
double
concoction
sweet
and
toasty
german
malts
although
malty
the
start
and
end
was
each
sip
felt
quite
dry
very
smooth
and
softly
textured
mouthfeel
simple
of
construction
but
more
complex
in
character
than
first
suggested
no
abv
listed
but
i
suspect
this
was
a
bit
heavier
than
a
typical
vienna
lager
exceptional
drinkability
definitely
a
session
beer
that
could
take
the
place
of
yuengling
if
it
was
more
available
a
great
take
on
this
style
not
as
malty
as
sam
adams
and
a
little
more
interesting
than
yuengling
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
forming
a
34
beige
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
amber
brew
thick
head
fades
slowly
with
dwelling
lace
aroma
is
balanced
and
lightly
fruity
taste
follows
the
nose
sedate
and
approachable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinking
is
easy
nothing
earthshattering
but
just
an
average
plus
brew
pours
a
clean
orangeish
copper
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
that
consist
of
a
sweet
lager
malt
in
the
taste
watery
a
very
small
malt
but
not
much
flavor
at
all
a
watery
mouthfeel
with
a
small
lagerish
aftertaste
that
ends
up
to
no
aftertaste
at
all
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
flavor
and
very
watery
pours
a
rich
copper
clear
and
with
an
ample
head
aroma
is
of
subtle
malt
and
hop
notes
taste
is
sweet
malty
no
adjuncts
here
theres
just
enough
hop
presence
to
balance
the
sweet
theres
also
the
steggy
house
metallic
twang
which
always
seems
to
be
appropriate
by
the
second
bottle
this
is
crisp
mediumbodied
and
finishes
lightly
sweet
drinkability
is
good
i
rate
it
slightly
below
sabl
and
slightly
above
negra
modelo
for
style
pours
a
translucent
amber
color
with
a
decentsized
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
good
bit
some
stickage
but
little
lacing
a
few
slow
moving
streamers
of
carbonation
aromas
of
lightly
toasted
malts
mild
hops
and
a
slight
mineral
quality
predominantly
malty
and
sweet
with
very
little
bitterness
to
counterbalance
other
than
some
light
astringency
in
the
finish
carbonation
seems
a
bit
low
as
if
it
was
all
blown
off
by
the
pour
whats
left
after
the
lower
carbonation
is
a
medium
bodied
lager
that
feels
a
bit
thicker
than
it
should
with
an
average
carbonation
level
overall
a
pretty
decent
allmalt
lager
that
is
fairly
drinkable
personally
i
like
it
better
than
yuengling
it
tastes
smoother
contains
no
adjuncts
and
is
more
affordable
its
worth
trying
out
but
wont
knock
your
socks
off
or
anything
i
think
this
beer
was
made
to
compete
with
yeungling
lager
if
so
id
buy
this
over
yuengling
if
it
came
down
to
it
folks
as
you
probably
already
know
this
is
not
the
summer
stock
it
looks
pretty
good
in
the
glass
its
amber
reddish
in
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
dissapates
in
a
bit
im
not
getting
a
lot
of
aroma
just
a
whiff
of
clean
malt
the
stuff
tastes
pretty
good
kind
of
on
the
amber
vienna
side
of
things
with
a
more
complex
malt
bill
like
the
all
the
steg
varietal
products
i
dont
think
this
is
any
lawnmower
beer
it
might
be
a
little
spritzy
but
that
adds
to
the
refreshment
i
think
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
bet
its
pretty
good
on
tap
if
available
light
to
almost
medium
mouthfeel
a
pleasing
juicy
feel
goes
down
very
nice
one
of
the
steg
beers
ive
had
i
hope
they
keep
this
one
around
give
this
beer
a
try
i
think
youll
be
pleasingly
suprized
skoal
i
am
continually
impressed
by
lions
new
stegmaier
offerings
this
one
is
another
winner
id
compare
it
to
yunegling
but
with
more
flavor
smoother
and
cleaner
and
obviously
no
adjuncts
at
20
a
case
i
could
see
this
converting
yuengling
drinkers
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
i
actually
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
apparently
im
in
the
minority
as
i
dont
see
it
around
much
any
more
oh
well
taste
back
to
ordinary
no
off
flavors
no
depth
but
pretty
standard
crystal
and
caramel
malt
presence
hopping
is
average
and
fair
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
going
to
impress
your
hardcore
beer
nerd
friends
this
one
is
more
geared
towards
others
maybe
waiting
to
make
the
leap
overall
much
better
drink
than
my
previous
tommyknocker
beer
i
definitely
would
drink
this
again
but
not
my
first
choice
considering
what
other
lagers
are
available
hope
you
all
enjoy
this
one
and
cheers
to
all
o
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
little
amber
lager
a
sweet
malt
flavor
with
some
subtle
hop
the
only
thing
keeping
from
being
better
is
the
slight
mineral
flavor
paired
with
turkey
burgers
with
sharp
provolone
and
avocados
over
all
this
is
a
decent
lager
but
there
is
nothing
real
distinctive
on
the
flavor
i
enjoyed
the
brew
but
there
are
better
versions
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
just
a
mess
and
smacks
of
having
an
identity
crisis
i
dont
get
this
beers
angle
at
all
where
is
the
basic
malt
presence
it
smacks
of
both
doppelbock
and
irish
red
ale
only
to
give
no
justice
to
those
styles
kind
of
a
lost
cause
here
not
impressed
overall
a
good
malty
amber
that
is
not
too
different
from
others
i
have
but
is
balanced
well
a
solid
amber
that
i
could
session
o
aroma
borders
on
4
but
taste
falls
short
if
you
like
ambers
this
is
something
different
to
try
t
brown
sugar
honey
malt
toasted
grains
a
much
darker
flavor
than
one
expects
in
an
amber
with
a
touch
more
hops
spice
i
like
the
flavor
quite
a
bit
but
can
see
how
those
expecting
a
true
amber
would
be
disappointed
o
well
there
arent
too
many
in
this
style
that
impress
me
this
one
didnt
impress
but
i
found
it
to
be
above
average
for
the
style
probably
wouldnt
choose
to
drink
again
but
if
it
were
given
to
me
at
a
barbeque
or
something
i
wouldnt
mind
overall
the
beer
is
okay
kind
or
plain
without
much
depth
overall
i
have
three
more
and
they
are
not
that
offensive
but
not
that
exciting
either
pretty
standard
amber
lager
d
overall
a
decent
amber
nice
mix
of
the
flavors
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
it
was
decent
nonetheless
o
this
is
a
decent
amber
lager
that
goes
down
smooth
and
is
enjoyable
the
caramel
malts
typical
for
this
style
are
roughly
where
they
should
be
and
the
citrus
flavors
balances
things
out
i
bought
this
as
a
part
of
a
12pack
that
has
six
different
beers
from
tommyknocker
brewery
pub
llc
so
far
the
two
that
i
have
sampled
have
been
ok
but
not
exceptional
by
any
means
i
like
the
two
bottles
per
style
consept
versus
12packs
that
have
four
different
beers
three
each
the
third
one
seems
to
always
end
up
lost
somewhere
in
the
fridge
since
i
like
to
drink
my
beers
from
a
tall
beer
glass
that
can
accomodate
two
12oz
botlles
at
a
time
on
tap
at
icelantic
skis
party
on
a
santa
fe
drive
art
friday
in
denver
the
pointless
late
sweetness
is
a
drag
but
overall
this
is
a
little
better
than
i
expected
and
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
a
light
body
that
should
be
medium
forming
the
base
with
too
much
carbonation
making
it
spritzy
not
heinously
thin
or
lightbodied
but
not
better
than
average
im
not
really
into
this
lager
at
all
it
really
is
lacking
in
a
lot
i
wont
be
seeking
this
again
one
big
blahhhh
overall
this
was
a
ok
amber
the
caramel
malts
were
about
where
they
should
be
for
this
style
but
all
in
all
they
come
off
sweeter
then
i
would
like
and
that
hurts
the
drinkablity
i
like
the
fruitier
notes
of
this
beer
and
the
orange
peel
flavor
and
aroma
worked
really
well
with
this
beer
i
liked
most
things
about
this
beer
but
in
the
end
it
is
just
to
sweet
for
an
amber
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
d
fruity
and
sweet
dare
i
say
a
girlie
drink
more
suited
for
the
beaches
of
cancun
then
on
the
seat
of
a
bar
ones
fine
hold
the
seconds
way
to
sweet
and
wouldnt
waste
my
time
or
money
on
a
repurchase
tommyknocker
ornery
amber
was
amber
in
color
and
hazy
with
some
sediment
floating
about
it
had
a
small
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
sweet
crystal
malt
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
the
taste
was
crystal
malt
and
hops
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
average
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
mediumlight
carbonation
drinkability
was
about
average
this
is
a
pretty
basic
amber
lager
i
though
this
was
a
pretty
good
amber
lager
much
more
hop
presence
than
i
would
expect
from
this
style
very
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
well
im
glad
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
mix
pack
and
not
as
a
whole
6er
i
will
say
that
it
looks
great
but
thats
where
the
positives
end
cross
this
one
off
the
list
not
worth
getting
again
the
taste
is
an
improvement
from
the
smell
its
creamy
and
more
malty
but
theres
a
modest
level
of
hop
bitterness
decent
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
leaves
a
sour
taste
in
the
mouth
d
very
not
too
cloying
sweet
but
quaffable
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorites
id
drink
another
one
if
it
were
free
but
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
one
conclusion
the
average
rating
for
this
beer
is
below
a
b
why
i
am
not
sure
because
this
bottle
is
tasting
quite
nice
for
an
amberreg
lager
i
dont
expect
anything
mind
blowing
from
this
style
simply
a
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
nice
with
an
array
of
simple
foods
or
by
itself
this
would
go
well
with
a
cheap
pizza
or
hamburger
any
day
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
glass
d
overall
a
tasty
offering
but
nothing
outstanding
ive
had
better
amber
ales
and
this
one
is
not
overly
memorable
that
all
being
said
its
still
a
worthy
ale
and
i
would
never
turn
one
down
if
offered
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
decently
sized
head
aromas
are
predominately
sweet
toffeeish
notes
of
sugary
cereal
are
also
present
flavors
arent
bad
but
theyre
very
unbalanced
the
hops
come
nowhere
close
to
balancing
the
sweet
maltiness
that
dominates
the
flavors
from
beginning
to
end
it
wouldnt
be
so
bad
if
only
the
malts
were
more
layered
and
interesting
but
theyre
pretty
much
one
note
wonders
here
this
one
is
glowing
with
an
orange
clouded
amber
body
off
white
orange
tinted
khaki
head
forms
nicely
with
sporadic
hit
and
miss
specks
of
lacing
aroma
a
nice
mix
of
sublte
bready
malts
and
a
chalky
mineral
yeast
character
going
on
not
much
hop
zing
flavor
pretty
much
a
weird
brew
up
front
sweetness
hits
with
caramelized
sugars
and
fresh
bread
tones
with
some
mineral
slighly
metallic
edges
really
not
a
bad
flavor
just
a
bit
one
dimensional
backing
cluster
hops
come
out
with
each
sip
but
nothing
other
than
to
balance
out
the
bready
sweentess
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
no
a
watery
beer
definitely
has
some
girth
to
it
no
off
flavors
to
be
had
carbonation
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
in
texture
drinkability
overall
was
solid
makes
me
not
as
scared
of
a
mixed
12
pack
from
them
as
i
used
to
be
decent
but
forgetable
overall
i
didnt
hate
this
and
it
served
a
secondary
purpose
of
washing
down
food
but
not
a
real
great
beer
just
ok
if
that
pretty
hazy
copper
colored
brew
small
khaki
head
topping
it
off
some
lacing
big
sweet
amber
malt
scent
touch
of
bitter
hops
mixed
in
there
the
thinness
immediately
strikes
me
the
malt
and
hop
tastes
are
kind
of
underwhelming
there
are
some
fruit
and
yeast
tones
that
are
fairly
pleasing
though
im
not
really
a
major
amber
guy
to
begin
with
but
this
one
seems
like
they
forgot
to
put
in
half
of
the
ingredients
d
nothing
too
impressive
going
on
here
the
appearance
is
average
at
best
and
teeters
on
slightly
off
putting
the
aroma
and
taste
are
an
incoherent
mix
of
scents
and
flavors
i
hate
to
be
overly
harsh
on
craft
offerings
but
this
one
is
sub
par
all
the
way
around
and
drifted
far
from
style
guidelines
this
was
my
first
tommy
knocker
offering
and
while
i
wont
discriminate
in
the
future
it
wont
be
a
brewery
that
i
eagerly
seek
out
d
definitely
a
more
flavorful
incarnation
of
an
american
lager
and
for
that
im
grateful
the
flavor
and
nose
are
a
bit
one
note
but
certainly
not
bad
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
caramel
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
hops
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
overall
one
of
my
faves
in
the
genre
nothing
special
but
a
pretty
solid
offering
nonetheless
sweet
malt
flavor
with
some
bandaid
phenols
and
a
bit
of
a
green
apple
tang
finishes
with
an
odd
watermelon
fruitiness
medium
bodied
with
midlevel
carbonation
on
the
sweet
side
overall
with
negligible
hop
presence
finishes
fairly
dry
nothing
id
want
again
but
i
can
finish
a
glass
inoffensive
d
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
it
goes
down
very
smooth
i
could
drink
several
of
them
if
thats
what
i
had
available
beer
smell
is
nothing
special
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
havent
been
sick
all
year
and
i
thought
my
nose
was
plugged
i
could
hardly
smell
any
of
the
beers
natural
aromas
taste
of
the
beer
is
alright
aftertaste
of
the
beer
is
good
though
not
one
of
my
favorite
ambers
but
i
would
drink
it
again
if
someone
bought
it
for
me
tommyknocker
fell
off
on
this
one
other
products
are
better
d
easy
to
pound
them
back
if
you
are
just
looking
for
fuel
to
get
hammered
and
not
for
flavor
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
faint
there
are
some
clean
malty
caramel
notes
with
no
hop
presence
whatsoever
the
taste
is
has
more
to
it
than
the
aroma
there
are
toffee
and
caramel
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
weak
example
of
an
amber
lager
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
again
not
exceptional
but
a
nice
midroad
red
lager
which
goes
down
easy
and
has
an
inviting
malt
quality
not
too
overloaded
with
hops
d
if
you
dont
care
what
beer
youre
drinking
you
could
probably
drink
a
good
few
of
these
if
you
dont
pay
attention
to
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
golden
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
yeast
cleanliness
slight
hops
some
fruity
aromas
and
some
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
amber
red
lager
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
up
front
some
earthy
malt
comes
through
as
well
a
good
hop
background
some
pine
notes
come
through
faintly
and
a
slight
dryness
is
present
in
the
finish
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
with
a
good
blend
of
flavors
the
appearance
is
lacking
though
worth
a
try
and
definitely
deserves
a
better
rep
than
it
has
received
so
far
taste
was
again
bready
malt
and
citrus
but
the
hops
made
their
presence
known
as
well
fairly
unassuming
flavor
but
wellrounded
nonetheless
not
too
much
sweetness
from
the
malt
before
the
hops
take
over
and
finish
dryly
too
be
honest
i
hope
im
not
too
tainted
by
the
shitty
service
i
got
when
i
swung
through
there
on
my
way
up
to
winter
park
when
the
waiters
a
seemed
totally
disinterested
in
my
business
and
then
b
overcharged
me
when
they
finally
got
around
to
ringing
me
up
this
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
cultured
yeast
and
whole
wheat
bread
with
some
brown
sugar
and
apple
butter
it
tasted
like
fresh
barley
and
wheat
malt
with
some
brown
sugar
and
sweet
bready
yeast
and
a
bit
of
copper
hops
it
was
slightly
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
somewhat
clean
but
basic
taste
and
the
flavor
elements
seemed
better
on
their
own
than
mixed
together
in
this
beer
it
had
pretty
good
body
and
was
easy
enough
to
drink
it
wasnt
offensive
at
all
but
the
beer
didnt
do
anything
to
excite
me
just
a
very
moderate
and
forgettable
drink
d
not
exceptional
on
flavor
but
nice
balance
gives
is
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
there
really
wasnt
anything
to
special
about
this
beer
but
it
was
worth
a
shot
nikki
drinkability
who
knows
it
certainly
drinks
easy
but
i
would
pass
up
on
it
for
many
others
drinkability
was
easy
but
maybe
too
easy
overall
id
rate
this
as
nice
like
that
nice
girl
you
took
on
one
date
but
didnt
get
around
to
calling
again
this
beer
looked
good
in
color
it
poured
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
wasnt
very
prevalent
everything
else
about
this
beer
was
bland
and
boring
the
taste
i
was
expecting
was
nonexistent
i
think
the
packaging
probably
does
more
for
this
beer
than
the
taste
i
did
buy
2
bottles
to
give
it
a
fair
chance
finish
fast
and
not
surprising
i
was
kinda
disappointed
in
this
beer
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
decent
look
macro
type
head
similar
to
a
masproduced
american
lagerbut
after
that
it
was
no
big
deal
if
i
had
paid
for
it
i
would
have
been
disapointed
it
just
seemed
to
fall
short
of
something
rather
ordinary
whith
some
really
incredible
offerings
out
there
this
was
kind
of
dull
d
ok
as
a
session
beer
not
terribly
exciting
but
not
bad
either
d
its
consumable
but
theres
not
a
lot
to
suggest
this
tk
offering
drinkability
a
decent
drinkable
amber
lager
but
thats
not
really
saying
all
that
much
still
though
ill
take
a
generic
brew
over
an
overpriced
bottle
of
something
gackinducing
and
horrendous
any
day
of
the
week
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
i
had
this
beer
ontap
at
the
brewery
in
idaho
springs
out
of
the
six
tommyknocker
beers
i
tried
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
along
with
the
pale
ale
a
very
appealing
red
color
in
the
glass
and
has
a
nice
caramel
malty
taste
to
it
it
was
very
well
balanced
and
refreshing
as
well
i
would
not
mind
trying
this
guy
again
in
the
future
overall
this
i
believe
would
be
a
solidgood
beer
if
there
was
some
balance
to
the
flavor
a
slightly
amber
color
maybe
some
orange
tints
mixed
into
the
redness
of
the
beer
with
a
mountainous
head
that
stayed
a
really
long
time
a
good
heavy
fruit
smell
with
not
just
citric
notes
but
some
heavier
darker
fruits
and
tropical
fruits
along
with
some
malty
sweetness
honey
while
there
is
a
decent
fruit
taste
to
this
beer
it
is
not
only
dull
but
rather
sour
overpowering
if
you
will
from
hop
bitterness
or
sour
grapes
or
something
fluffy
from
heavy
carbonation
has
a
crisp
rather
too
sharp
backbite
that
neutralized
my
taste
buds
just
doesnt
add
up
in
the
taste
department
not
my
cup
of
beer
overall
dull
and
boring
ill
drink
the
other
bottle
from
my
variety
12
pack
but
i
wont
turn
to
this
beer
again
amber
colored
ale
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
mainly
caramel
taste
is
caramel
with
a
slight
fruity
twist
all
in
all
a
decent
alesomething
that
i
would
drink
again
but
not
actively
seek
out
i
would
recommend
to
my
buddies
to
try
at
least
one
time
d
eh
not
bad
not
good
just
an
average
amber
lager
really
this
looks
really
nice
and
smells
good
too
but
it
falls
short
once
you
get
the
stuff
into
your
mouth
a
fairly
unimpressive
red
ale
flavor
whose
saving
grace
is
that
there
werent
any
off
flavors
to
it
good
to
try
but
not
enough
to
be
interesting
d
this
is
an
okay
beer
not
bad
for
the
style
and
quite
sessionable
this
is
an
easy
drinkin
beer
that
has
decent
taste
the
body
was
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
but
that
actually
helped
make
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
light
bronze
color
with
a
nice
head
that
drops
firm
cap
that
trails
some
minor
bubbly
lacing
first
smell
gives
you
a
nice
fresh
floral
hop
burst
this
changes
to
some
heavy
caramel
malt
taste
is
mostly
the
malt
but
there
are
some
off
wet
hay
flavors
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
this
one
started
off
promising
but
on
closer
examination
it
is
lacking
just
an
average
brew
at
best
d
blah
american
ambers
are
either
super
hopped
and
delicious
lagunitas
nugget
nectar
etc
or
they
are
good
entry
level
crossover
beers
fat
tire
or
they
are
boring
wastes
of
my
time
this
amber
belongs
in
the
later
category
drinkability
truly
nothing
to
keep
me
interested
here
nothing
other
than
the
cardboard
taste
really
turns
me
off
but
nothing
gets
me
excited
at
all
will
not
get
again
d
oneor
maybe
two
of
these
is
all
i
could
put
down
in
a
week
or
month
if
that
its
alright
but
i
have
had
better
reds
bottle
says
enjoy
within
4
months
of
date
notched
and
that
is
november
2007
so
this
is
a
slightly
dated
beer
oh
well
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
amberorange
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
looks
pretty
dead
the
smell
is
very
minimal
as
well
maybe
a
hint
of
sweet
caramel
malt
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
also
has
the
sweet
crystal
pressence
decently
balanced
with
some
earthy
not
overly
assertive
hops
very
smooth
from
start
to
finish
no
lingering
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
and
undercarbonated
drinkablility
of
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
it
could
use
some
additional
carbonation
and
maybe
some
more
aroma
hops
but
other
than
that
a
solid
beer
taste
is
that
of
sweet
butterscoth
which
suggests
it
may
have
been
sitting
too
long
on
the
shelf
bought
it
as
part
of
the
trail
mix
other
varieties
lacking
also
aroma
was
not
impressive
finish
was
fair
at
best
not
a
beer
i
would
likely
buy
again
this
lager
is
a
clear
amber
color
and
has
a
decent
beige
head
the
nose
has
some
candy
malts
and
is
fairly
light
the
taste
follows
suit
really
faint
malts
and
almost
no
presence
of
hops
a
light
body
makes
this
a
drinkable
brew
another
average
beer
from
tommyknocker
an
easy
drinker
that
isnt
overly
complex
or
palate
killing
but
a
decent
enough
beer
d
drinkability
is
average
the
beer
is
bland
and
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
d
not
too
shabby
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
if
you
like
yuengling
this
isnt
a
bad
comparison
drinkability
first
beer
of
the
day
after
building
a
deck
for
6
hours
so
almost
anything
would
be
drinkable
right
now
but
overall
okay
i
would
drink
another
but
wouldnt
stock
up
drinkability
is
ok
but
too
sweet
for
the
style
a
very
good
beer
one
that
i
could
keep
coming
back
to
i
sound
harsh
keep
in
mind
this
sweet
taste
is
actually
pretty
tasty
i
just
think
it
could
use
more
complexity
and
balance
pours
cloudy
tealike
color
with
just
a
thin
lace
of
head
smell
is
sweet
with
some
very
fruity
aromas
and
some
hints
of
wheat
quite
carbonated
going
down
with
the
taste
being
very
fruity
citruslike
at
first
but
turns
to
a
malty
flavors
in
the
end
with
slight
hop
edge
in
the
after
taste
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
overall
is
it
was
a
average
beer
drinkability
a
good
beer
kinda
like
fat
tire
light
although
this
is
a
lager
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
not
turn
one
down
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
get
a
full
six
pack
overall
this
was
a
decent
little
amber
i
wont
say
anything
really
stood
out
to
be
fantastic
about
it
but
it
was
definitely
decent
and
would
say
that
it
would
probably
be
good
in
a
pinch
above
average
and
you
could
definitely
do
worse
then
trying
this
one
oelergud
not
too
shabby
this
is
one
of
the
better
tk
brews
ive
had
which
unfortunately
doesnt
say
a
whole
lot
i
could
get
blasted
on
this
at
a
pub
but
wouldnt
drink
it
for
pleasure
the
reality
tv
of
beers
entertaining
but
entirely
forgettable
one
of
the
easiest
ambers
to
consume
a
surprisingly
enjoyable
brew
that
i
had
the
pleasure
to
pour
for
others
at
the
charlotte
oktoberfest
as
a
volunteer
right
on
par
to
the
color
and
head
retention
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
though
nothing
too
exciting
its
qualities
make
it
a
popular
choice
at
the
ofest
for
others
and
myself
seasons
almost
over
not
paying
any
attention
to
the
label
i
did
not
realise
until
i
opened
it
that
it
was
a
lager
a
rather
poor
lager
pour
was
condusive
with
the
style
clear
orange
red
with
a
quickly
vanishing
head
i
can
sum
this
whole
thing
up
by
saying
it
lacked
character
depth
flavour
and
a
whole
host
of
other
things
this
was
reddish
brown
carbonated
water
this
is
hardly
even
a
beer
d
average
this
could
be
a
goto
amber
or
a
sessioner
for
fans
of
the
style
worth
trying
overall
a
pretty
poor
example
of
an
amber
lager
hell
yuengling
is
better
than
this
i
bought
a
mixed
sixer
so
luckily
i
have
only
one
of
these
to
drink
pass
this
one
by
going
70mph
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
minimal
fluffy
head
that
does
leave
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
very
sweet
and
actually
smells
pretty
decent
sweet
malted
barley
in
the
nose
taste
is
very
bland
does
not
have
a
real
taste
to
it
maybe
a
bit
of
orange
peel
and
just
a
slight
taste
of
hop
bitterness
heavy
carbonation
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
overall
not
the
best
i
have
tasted
but
its
a
bit
decent
drinkability
could
do
two
in
a
night
but
not
backtoback
a
little
too
sweet
for
that
this
is
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
pretty
standard
for
the
style
it
would
go
well
with
just
about
any
meal
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
night
but
the
amber
ale
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
and
didnt
go
well
on
the
first
sip
after
settling
into
the
beer
it
wasnt
too
bad
light
spicy
notes
in
the
nose
and
a
little
malt
sweetness
underneath
taste
follows
very
similar
to
the
nose
malty
peppery
spice
and
a
bit
thin
overall
ok
but
not
going
to
drive
out
of
may
way
to
get
it
drinkability
fair
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
one
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
several
off
flavors
that
really
kind
of
ruined
it
for
me
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
is
good
overall
a
pretty
basic
amber
lager
i
wouldnt
say
it
really
stands
out
but
its
a
decent
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
session
if
i
couldnt
find
anything
more
interesting
worth
a
try
the
mouth
is
just
thick
enough
with
a
bit
of
slickness
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
expect
my
reds
to
be
sessionable
and
this
one
is
lives
up
to
my
expectations
this
could
easily
work
as
a
crossover
beers
for
folks
who
have
mastered
the
killians
and
amber
bocks
of
the
world
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
nothing
offensive
and
plenty
to
enjoy
and
ponder
an
ale
that
not
only
stimulates
the
palate
but
also
the
brewing
lobe
in
all
of
us
not
your
average
lager
it
was
hard
to
ascertain
the
color
since
i
drank
it
from
a
brown
bottle
but
the
head
is
fairly
thick
and
frothy
aroma
is
strong
and
pleasant
much
better
than
that
of
most
lagers
i
have
sampled
the
taste
is
strong
not
complex
but
pleasant
with
some
surprising
hoppy
overtones
smooth
and
zesty
this
is
a
good
party
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
overall
i
think
the
beer
is
balanced
nicely
solid
drinkability
level
but
probably
not
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
this
one
might
be
a
tad
underrated
on
ba
pours
a
very
light
amber
color
and
will
give
you
a
three
finger
head
with
a
forced
pour
that
holds
fairly
well
and
a
medium
lacing
slight
roasted
malt
and
floral
aromas
but
weak
taste
some
caramel
and
toast
but
weak
needs
more
carbonation
to
pick
up
the
taste
buds
i
would
probably
not
go
looking
for
this
one
but
its
not
bad
but
i
think
there
is
better
out
there
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
alright
average
head
caramel
aroma
with
a
slight
flowery
hoppiness
very
bready
character
almost
milky
bit
dry
very
light
maltiness
and
an
even
lighter
hop
mustiness
ok
but
did
nothing
to
really

my
attention

from
my
variety
pack
after
the
enjoyable
glacier
and
the
downright
tasty
butthead
i
had
high
hopes
for
the
amber
unfortunately
it
was
my
least
favorite
in
the
box
light
browngray
color
in
the
glass
no
real
smell
good
or
bad
thin
rather
spritzy
mouthfeel
worst
of
all
the
taste
was
like
coors
almost
tasteless
malt
with
a
buttery
smooth
blandness
and
a
strange
metallic
aftertaste
i
didnt
even
finish
the
glass
gasp
because
it
was
just
that
bad
with
so
many
fanatastic
amber
lagers
out
there
among
american
craft
brewers
this
was
a
disappointment
the
only
caramel
in
the
thing
is
the
coloring
pours
a
slightly
hazed
deep
orangish
amber
color
with
a
ring
of
lacing
around
the
side
of
the
glass
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
malt
make
up
the
nose
the
flavor
is
pretty
straighforward
with
a
slightly
toasted
malt
background
and
a
faint
hop
presence
in
the
finish
it
seems
there
is
just
not
enough
malt
or
hops
for
that
matter
overall
this
is
a
decent
at
best
brew
that
is
not
something
i
will
purchase
again
drinkability
these
disappear
fast
a
most
competent
and
sessionable
beer
from
tk
this
beer
straddles
the
fine
line
between
bland
and
offensive
with
blandness
thankfully
winning
out
albeit
slightly
the
yeast
aint
good
enough
to
be
the
star
of
the
show
and
nothing
else
comes
to
its
rescue
its
not
the
sort
of
thing
ill
choose
to
drink
again
di
dont
really
care
for
it
and
would
not
have
it
again
drinkability
not
terrible
i
probably
wont
buy
another
pack
of
the
tommyknockers
beer
this
came
in
the
12
pack
sample
and
is
one
of
the
better
ones
but
still
not
great
12
oz
bottle
best
within
four
months
of

2006
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
quickly
subsides
to
a
thin
ring
of
lace
nose
is
a
slightly
toasty
malt
with
a
caramel
note
rather
light
taste
has
a
light
malty
sweetness
overlaid
with
a
slight
grassy
hops
the
whole
thing
giving
way
to
a
bad
sour
fruit
aftertaste
thin
bodied
watered
down
this
beer
is
a
mess
between
the
waterlike
body
and
the
horrible
aftertaste
this
beer
is
a
drainpour
the
drinkability
is
good
i
really
like
the
toasty
carmel
notes
i
would
buy
this
again
mk
poured
a
bright
orange
color
with
moderate
white
puffy
head
smell
is
very
light
with
only
a
bit
of
sweet
fruit
to
be
found
taste
presents
a
firm
sweet
maltiness
that
is
exceptionally
pleasnt
nice
full
creamy
mouthfeel
finish
is
light
and
very
refreshing
very
drinkable
however
the
flavor
begins
to
fade
as
more
of
the
glass
in
consumed
orange
amber
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
lasts
as
a
ring
fruity
aroma
like
apple
peels
and
white
grapes
with
fresh
grains
a
caramel
malt
and
a
little
musty
hops
the
taste
is
fruity
as
well
the
apple
peel
and
grapes
are
there
but
also
some
ripe
orange
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
a
sloid
caramel
malt
that
is
a
bit
grainy
flavor
with
a
little
yeasty
flavor
some
grassy
and
musty
hops
come
through
a
bit
more
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flat
it
sticks
the
the
mouth
a
bit
average
carbonation
but
nothing
bad
about
it
the
drinkability
is
actually
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
premium
beer
but
well
crafted
none
the
less
i
could
easily
have
more
than
a
couple
dont
drink
this
one
too
cold
as
it
mutes
a
lot
of
the
character
i
was
disappointed
cold
but
it
was
good
a
bit
warmer
a
boring
average
amber
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
in
the
future
interesting
malt
profile
makes
this
a
decent
amber
would
make
a
good
session
beer
i
found
the
mustiness
interesting
and
unexpected
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
leading
to
a
more
sessionable
beverage
finishes
slightly
sweet
d
i
must
have
got
a
good
bottle
because
i
thought
it
wasnt
bad
i
wouldnt
hunt
it
down
but
id
certainly
drink
it
again
if
presented
to
me
hazy
copper
with
golden
highlights
big
bubbled
antique
white
head
of
steadily
wilting
foam
that
became
a
skim
coat
no
carbonation
streams
and
no
lacing
light
fresh
grain
with
a
soft
spicy
lemon
zest
component
light
grain
notes
up
front
that
give
way
to
the
gentle
spicy
hops
which
carry
through
the
finish
the
finish
is
brief
and
the
palate
is
clean
the
carbonation
is
sufficient
to
lift
the
medium
body
passable
but
still
left
room
for
improvement
perhaps
being
one
month
past
the
brewery
fresh
taste
date
was
the
culprit
pretty
typical
of
ambers
a
good
safe
beer
quite
clear
medium
amber
color
with
initial
promising
retention
then
went
flat
smells
pretty
malty
with
a
citrus
hop
aroma
tastes
moderately
malty
and
lightly
syrupy
strong
hops
remind
me
of
an
american
pale
ale
body
is
moderate
with
a
light
tacky
feel
finishes
a
bit
sweet
and
biteey
maybe
from
over
stressed
grain
id
like
to
try
it
again
but
im
not
in
any
hurry
cetainly
deserves
to
be
tagged
an
american
version
of
an
amber
a
surpisingly
aggressive
hops
bite
jumps
out
at
the
gate
some
rough
hopsoil
flavors
add
a
slightly
grating
edge
to
the
hops
that
is
not
unpleasant
so
long
as
you
like
your
hops
on
the
rugged
side
nicely
paired
with
a
caramel
malt
but
the
beer
was
weighted
just
a
tad
too
much
in
favor
of
the
hops
finish
was
blunt
with
bittersweetness
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a

light
tan
head
over
the
cloudy
orangey
amber
brew
head
quickly
depletes
to
a
swirly
film
with
a
group
of
big
bubbles
in
one
area
with
average
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
grain
pellet
with
a
touch
of
tart
fruit
taste
is
the
same
wellbalanced
sedate
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
maybe
a
bit
chalky
and
drinkability
is
very
high
didnt
have
too
high
of
hopes
for
this
brew
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
feel
is
fairly
bold
clean
and
wellrounded
within
a
medium
body
again
the
malts
are
whats
making
this
amber
worth
anything
and
its
not
bad
i
suppose
a
bit
more
hoppyness
could
help
add
some
complexity
and
balance
otherwise
this
is
a
fairly
easy
going
amber
thats
easy
enought
to
have
a
couple
more
of
before
boredom
may
set
in
thanks
to
justin
my
2nd
cuz
on
my
wifes
side
for
the
samples
not
bad
very
smooth
toffee
and
grain
flavors
it
is
a
wee
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
still
tasty
enough
and
reasonably
drinkable
recommended
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
on
the
thin
side
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
wont
be
particularly
upset
if
i
never
drink
this
one
again
last
swigs

a
bit
of
diacetyl
no

very
consistent
taste

malted

a
bit
of
vanilla
pleasant
residual
sugars
not
much
of
a
snap
to
it
thats
the
good
part
while
easily
quaffable
the
beer
is
pretty
thin
and
average
in
most
flavor
and
body
categories
might
be
a
good
introductory
lager
for
someone
who
is
looking
for
a
malty
easy
drinker
and
wants
to
try
some
different
things
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
some
light
hops
and
a
fruity
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
crisp
yet
dry
caramel
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
bitter
with
some
residual
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
amber
lager
the
aroma
is
great
but
the
flavor
falls
short
of
expectations
overall
a
good
drinker
12
oz
with
an
overdue
freshness

damn
you
mikes
mart
anyway
it
looks
quite
nice
pours
into
the
pilsner
glass
a
hazy
chestnut
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
1
finger
tan
head
that
leaves
some
lace
lots
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
after
the
pour
caramel
and
almost
cloyingly
sweet
malts
in
the
nose
taste
is
sour
and
very
bad
i
taste
dill
pickles
seriously
its
bad
i
tasted
several
gulps
to
make
sure
it
was
that
bad
i
could
barely
hold
it
in
my
mouth
long
enough
to
judge
the
mouthfeel
which
was
average
i
guess
this
is
the
first
time
ive
dumped
a
beer
im
reviewing
down
the
drain
the
other
beers
from
the
mixed
12
arent
bad
perhaps
it
was
never
good
in
the
first
place
to
me
this
is
one
avoidable
brew
the
sourness
is
just
too
much
all
in
all
a
good
solid
effort
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
when
the
waitress
brought
me
another
one
it
wasnt
bad
enough
for
me
to
trade
it
in
but
i
wont
be
ordering
it
again
well
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
since
i
forgot
about
it
and
a
fair
amount
of
the
carbonation
is
gone
it
tastes
much
better
which
still
isnt
stellar
the
aftertaste
now
has
some
fruity
flavors
strawberry
and
pear
theres
also
a
tang
that
comes
across
as
iron
but
im
thinking
it
originated
from
toasted
grains
appearance
is
translucent
dark
amber
with
beige
foam
and
not
much
lace
aroma
is
of
brown
sugar
and
malt
with
leafy
hops
initial
taste
is
bland
some
grain
malt
and
bitter
floral
hops
middle
has
caramel
but
not
too
sweet
a
light
watery
brew
slightly
sweet
with
a
finish
strong
on
yeast
bread
i
would
not
try
again
pours
an
orangeamber
red
with
little
or
no
head
nose
is
pleasantly
fruity
citrusy
and
hoppy
taste
is
a
thick
sweet
citrus
with
creamy
malts
and
a
hop
bite
more
mediumbodied
than
i
had
expected
for
this
red
highly
carbonated
makes
it
more
drinkable
could
see
myself
putting
a
few
of
these
back
though
i
dont
know
if
im
enough
of
a
red
fan
to
come
back
for
more
not
a
bad
beer
though
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
slightly
hazed
light
maroon
color
small
ring
of
foam
around
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
light
maltiness
sweet
with
carmel
and
a
light
grassiness
taste
is
also
slightly
sweet
and
malty
hops
are
not
that
prominent
but
there
this
is
pretty
similar
to
the
quality
of
the
othr
tk
beers
slightly
above
average
but
not
outstanding
ornery
amber
isnt
ornery
in
the
least
its
flavor
is
anything
but
aggressive
or
challenging
although
it
is
a
minor
chore
to
get
through
the
entire
bottle
the
limp
mouthfeel
brings
a
few
other
adjectives
to
mind
but
ornery
surely
isnt
among
them
this
is
my
first
tommyknocker
beer
and
i
am
something
less
than
impressed
drinkability
is
not
great
would
look
elsewhere
if
you
desire
a
good
amber
thanks
to
merlin48
for
this
sample
drinkability
is
good
here
taste
is
decent
enough
for
a
session
amber
but
there
are
many
better
choices
this
is
an
unremarkable
beer
that
is
okay
to
drink
because
it
has
a
pretty
good
flavor
what
it
lacks
in
appearrance
and
body
it
makes
up
for
in
taste
its
just
not
enough
to
make
it
better
than
a
slightly
above
average
beer
maybe
its
better
on
tap
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dies
away
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
citrus
but
nothing
too
strong
some
malt
is
there
too
the
flavor
is
somewhat
bland
like
the
aroma
slightly
watered
down
there
is
a
small
hop
presence
and
it
doesnt
have
the
standard
lager
stank
i
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
headthat
drops
to
a
nice
film
over
the
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
has
a
citrusy
grapefruit
and
orange
the
taste
is
just
sort
of
flat
without
anything
that
jumps
up
and
grabs
me
theres
a
metallic
aftertaste
taht
sticks
with
you
well
after
the
beer
is
done
im
not
real
impressed
with
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
there
is
a
creamy
texture
that
i
havent
felt
in
other
beers
before
its
a
nice
feeling
theres
not
as
much
carbonation
as
i
would
expect
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
but
i
think
it
comes
as
a
sacrifice
for
flavor
the
beer
is
worth
trying
but
another
mediocre
offering
from
tommyknocker
very
drinkable
but
not
for
the
right
reasons
its
so
smooth
and
flavorless
it
goes
down
easy
this
beer
wasnt
terrible
by
any
means
i
was
just
expecting
alot
more
it
is
quite
refreshing
but
i
personally
wouldnt
put
it
much
above
a
good
lawnmower
beer
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
with
virtually
no
bittering
from
hops
the
feel
is
thin
watery
and
lacks
snap
in
the
finish
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
fairly
poor
actually
and
my
numbers
are
generous
lack
of
desirable
drinkability
due
to
the
unimpressive
feel
and
lackluster
taste
the
ornery
amber
poured
a
redorangecopper
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
only
a
collar
has
a
subtle
malty
nose
with
hints
of
caramel
it
has
a
pretty
mild
taste
to
it
some
maltiness
with
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
there
is
no
hop
taste
to
speak
of
here
as
it
warmed
up
i
noticed
more
caramel
flavor
and
maybe
some
subtle
fruitiness
its
a
pretty
smooth
drinkable
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
its
clear
orangeishcopper
body
is
capped
by
a
thin
frothy
head
that
drops
readily
to
a
bigbubble
accented
collar
and
leaves
only
spotty
lace
the
nose
is
mainly
malty
with
a
distinct
note
of
caramel
amidst
its
bready
and
lightly
toasted
munich
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
background
floral
hops
the
body
is
medium
and
its
fine
moderate
carbonation
leaves
it
gently
crisp
before
warming
to
become
slightly
creamy
and
smooth
across
the
palate
everything
suggested
by
the
aroma
is
carried
forth
in
the
flavor
with
a
round
gently
toasted
nutty
and
caramelish
malt
thats
accented
by
a
slight
floral
hop
flavor
and
a
lowkey
bitterness
it
finishes
slightly
sticky
with
malt
sugars
but
then
dries
quickly
leaving
the
palate
ready
for
another
taste
interestingly
malty

since

a
good

when
i

ornery
i
think
of
the
smartass
kids
you
find
on
network
tv
sitcoms
i
hate
those
kids
luckily
i
will
not
hold
the
adjective
against
this
beer
pours
a
dark
orangishbrown
with
a
medium
thin
bone
white
head
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
maple
mediumbodied
and
kind
of
syrupy
with
flavors
of
caramel
malt
honey
and
hops
more
hops
would
have
helped
this
beer
as
it
almost
ods
on
the
sweetsyrupy
aspect
the
finish
is
sticky
too
another
forgettable
beer
from
tommyknocker
this
brew
pours
a
small
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
offwhite
bubbles
and
a
transparent
slightly
cloudy
carbonated
amber
body
its
aroma
is
that
of
mild
malts
and
caramel
this
brew
has
a
mild
initial
caramel
flavor
with
a
bit
of
acidic
undertones
the
spices
also
come
out
to
play
as
along
with
the
roasted
caramel
notes
all
of
the
flavors
are
quite
mild
but
still
tied
together
in
a
slightly
complex
manner
if
it
was
stronger
id
like
it
even
more
when
this
brew
was
poured
into
my
glass
it
had
a
small
offwhite
creamy
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
the
body
was
cloudy
thin
and
watery
and
it
was
light
orangish
in
hue
there
was
very
little
lacing
with
this
brew
there
was
very
little
character
to
this
brew
it
was
just
plain
flat
and
boring
color
is
a
dark
orange
amber
duh
its
name
says
what
it
is
poured
with
very
little
almost
non
existent
head
that
disappeared
very
quick
smell
is
a
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
raisin
its
flavor
is
a
rich
sweet
malt
almost
thick
with
only
a
bit
of
hoppiness
which
you
dont
even
taste
until
about
10
seconds
after
you
swallow
it
its
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
though
a
good
beer
for
those
who
dont
like
a
great
deal
of
hop
in
their
brew
pours
a
sort
of
funky
dark
orangeamber
color
topped
by
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
head
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
ring
of
foam
the
aroma
has
a
similar
funk
to
it
becuase
it
has
a
familiar
smell
to
it
but
id
swear
it
is
decomposing
grass
clippings
or
wet
hay
maybe
its
that
smell
from
a
bottle
of
vitamins
whatever
it
is
its
not
disgusting
just
out
of
place
theres
a
decent
malt
component
to
the
smell
as
well
ok
the
taste
has
a
vitmain
medicinal
metallic
note
as
well
maybe
this
is
vitabeer
i
even
get
the
vitamin
aftertaste
after
a
few
sips
the
taste
gets
a
bit
sweeter
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
aftertatse
is
a
touch
of
citrus
grainy
gritty
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
little
less
than
average
most
lagers
have
a
lot
less
aftertaste
and
a
cleaner
nose
glad
theres
only
one
crystal
clear
dark
copper
hue
thin
spotty
soapy
head
manages
muddled
loose
lace
light
caramel
and
gently
toasted
malt
in
aroma
with
a
slight
tinge
of
herbal
hops
clean
but
prosaic
aromawise
non
descript
caramel
malt
sweetness
initially
in
flavor
is
ensued
by
grainy
mildly
nutty
vienna
malt
and
mild
hop
bitterness
faintly
floral
hop
flavor
hints
of
toffee
and
toast
emerge
late
adding
token
depth
hop
bitterness
is
too
understated
to
offset
the
prominent
caramel
malt
presence
lending
balance
well
skewed
towards
malt
sweetness
lightly
bodied
passably
dextrinous
in
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
bready
sweetness
yielding
to
a
slight
tartness
akin
to
an
unhopped
yeast
starter
ornery
amber
is
a
decent
brew
without
outright
flaw
but
without
noteable
character
either
quaff
and
move
on
hmmmmm
a
beer
that
pours
no
head
interesting
scarlet
red
in
color
slightly
chill
hazed
some
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
and
faint
hops
and
a
little
mustiness
as
well
taste
is
more
of
the
same
subtle
sweet
malt
with
traces
of
chocolate
malt
as
well
and
the
mustiness
as
well
body
is
decent
about
mediumfull
nothing
horrible
here
but
on
the
flipside
nothing
good
either
i
thought
i
was
getting
an
ornery
amber
ale
and
instead
i
got
an
ordinary
amber
ale
should
be
called
ordinary
amber
flavor
isnt
bad
has
a
sweet
malty
taste
and
i
get
some
caramel
tones
to
it
the
nose
light
but
has
some
malt
notes
body
is
flat
and
this
holds
this
down
from
a
very
slightly
above
average
beer
to
a
slightly
below
average
beer
also
just
a
tich
too
sweet
on
the
finish
not
much
for
hops
on
this
one
this
colorado
mountain
brew
pours
a
light
orangeamber
color
with
almost
no
head
retention
the
aroma
is
bready
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
hop
spice
the
body
is
light
and
the
flavor
is
quite
malty
with
a
lingering
hop
spiciness
in
a
bottle
this
is
an
average
amber
it
seems
that
the
brewer
is
still
playing
with
a
melded
flavor
profile
it
poured
practically
no
head
and
has
little
aroma
to
excite
the
senses
a
medium
body
with
tamed
roasted
caramel
malts
and
dry
crisp
finish
left
me
thinking
that
this
was
brewed
not
to
offend
anyone
not
great
not
bad
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
kind
of
a
disappointment
overall
not
bad
id
do
it
again
and
i
dont
regret
choosing
it
instead
of
the
fat
tire
that
was
my
only
other
option
overall
its
an
acceptable
beer
but
nothing
stellar
a
notch
above
bud
but
not
into
great
beer
territory
this
beer
pours
from
the
can
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
plentiful
cap
of
foam
the
lager
has
an
inviting
aroma
with
a
wonderful
mixture
of
clean
barley
malts
and
bittering
hops
the
accent
on
malt
is
a
nice
touch
a
smooth
and
clean
feel
on
the
on
the
palate
leads
to
caramel
notes
with
a
slightly
bitter
nicely
balanced
finished
a
great
refreshing
beer
to
enjoy
while
at
the
ballpark
this
is
ithe
greatest
beer
coors
has
ever
brewed
clealry
a
beer
based
on
marekting
and
a
bit
gimicky
but
on
the
other
hand
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
featuring
all
colorado
ingredients
and
only
available
in
this
the
greatest
of
states
a
beer
to
be
proud
of
no
matter
who
its
from
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
off
white
and
foamy
head
the
beer
is
a
hazy
amber
color
that
is
a
little
bit
copper
and
leans
towards
the
red
side
the
beer
smell
is
a
yeasty
and
caramel
malty
smell
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
the
hops
are
a
slight
note
but
still
make
an
appearance
the
beer
has
a
much
stronger
hop
presence
than
in
the
smell
the
hop
taste
is
balanced
by
the
malt
taste
similar
to
the
smell
the
malts
primarily
consist
of
a
sweet
and
light
caramel
taste
additionally
the
beer
has
a
slight
mineral
taste
as
well
as
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
feel
is
crisp
and
lean
with
biting
carbonation
a
pretty
good
lager
and
shocking
that
this
came
from
a
millercoors
subsidiary
overall
this
was
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
beer
that
shocked
the
hell
out
of
me
since
the
macro
owned
stigma
can
give
misconceptions
and
decreased
interest
but
my
friend
vinny
insisted
i
try
it
as
he
had
2
cases
brought
to
ny
so
i
thank
him
again
for
sharing
a
few
with
me
a
definite
session
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
glad
these
escaped
colorado
and
made
it
to
ny
as
they
were
easy
to
put
down
and
enjoy
a
pretty
decent
tasting
amber
drinks
pretty
easily
oi
tried
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
when
it
first
arrived
and
was
less
than
enthused
but
this
second
look
was
positive
the
flavors
are
good
and
there
is
a
great
balance
between
malt
and
hop
with
a
nice
bite
for
the
style
setting
aside
the
craft
v
crafty
issue
here
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
overall
a
pretty
decent
clean
and
easy
drinking
amber
lager
malt
forward
with
a
very
refreshing
lager
smoothness
with
a
dab
of
hop
bitterness
to
nicely
balance
everything
out
it
turns
out
that
a
beer
thats
so
simple
in
its
plan
and
execution
yields
so
much
dialogue
im
not
one
to
sell
it
as
as
an
undiscovered
gem
it
shows
that
theres
a
lot
of
appreciation
to
be
said
about
simple
beers
done
well
turns
out
that
native
colorado
ingredients
make
wonderful
beers
just
a
real
solid
nice
simple
amber
lager
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
it
cleanly
shows
off
the
bready
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
i
am
not
sure
i
agree
it
is
the
only
lager
ever
brewed
with
rocky
mountain
water

overall
yuengling
is
a
classact
american
style
beer
i
have
graded
this
beer
on
what
its
purpose
is
as
i
think
is
only
fair
its
a
damnsight
better
than
budweiser
and
it
should
be
recognized
as
such
if
i
ever
get
some
foreign
friends
together
im
taking
them
to
quakersteak
lube
and
were
getting
a
lubetube
of
yuengling
that
is
what
this
beer
is
to
me
of
course
its
for
easy
drinking
it
has
an
easyopen
cap
for
crying
out
loud
no
bottleopener
required
and
thats
for
a
good
reason
this
is
a
open
bar
beer
this
beer
along
with
moosehead
lager
are
my
two
top
session
beers
an
above
average
beer
good
for
sessioning
best
out
of
can
average
everyday
beer
good
for
drinking
casually
at
a
bar
when
others
are
not
available
o
very
familiar
but
hadnt
had
one
in
years
it
was
refreshing
not
bad
for
a
sessionable
cheap
beer
if
you
are
drinking

you
may
want
to
reevaluate
your
beer
buying

my
go

outstanding
look
is

rich

color
smells
of
a
sweet
roasted
caramel
malt
well
balanced
taste
of
a
oldstyle
larger
feel
is
mediumbodied
and
quite
drinkable
overall
this
is
my
goto
beer
at
most
eateries
if
they
dont
have
any
better
mediumbodied
import
it
seems
to
be
available
everywhere
except
poolhalls
for
some
reason
and
one
of
the
few
mainstream
american
largers
ill
drink
along
with
sam
adams
if
you
are
into
adjuncts
this
one
os
no
better
or
worse
than
most
im
not
sure
if
this
tasted
amazing
because
i
had
just
finished
4
months
of
basic
training
in
the
army
or
what
but
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
dont
know
why
people
think
this
is
good
it
tastes
bad
even
for
a
lager
an
east
coast
classicnorthern
midwest
classic
dont
bother
trying
this
beer
its
better
than
bud
or
miller
my
goto
bargain
beer
a
golden
tanned
color
with
a
light
hoppy
taste
makes
this
beer
go
down
smooth
definitely
a
great
beer
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
nice
clear
amber
color
the
head
is
foamy
and
fleeting
with
some
lacing
grains
along
with
some
adjuncts
in
both
the
flavor
and
smell
minimal
hopping
noted
very
smooth
mouth
feel
although
just
a
bit
an
the
watery
side
very
good
carbonation
level
makes
for
easy
drinking
for
an
expensive
adjunct
lager
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
is
great
after
a
day
working
outside
or
while
working
the
bbq
if
your
palate
has
not
been
manipulated
at
this
point
then
this
standard
lager
is
pretty
much
as
good
as
it
gets
in
the
macro
world
drinks
must
better
than
most
american
lagers
seems
to
be
the
beer
of
choice
for
other
fellas
to
pick
up
during
hockey
tournaments
or
at
least
for
the
last
few
sitting
at
the
hotel
bsing
about
the
days
events
isnt
the
best
time
to
crack
open
a
ton
of
crafty
brew
so
instead
ill
join
in
on
this
limp
nosed
yet
grainy
on
the
malt
lager
mouthfeel
is
a
little
to
think
to
be
considered
crisp
in
my
opinion
and
works
as
a
governor
for
drinking
far
better
than
light
beers
i
have
to
give
a
review
because
my
rating
was
too
low
i
mean
its
better
than
your
bud
coors
or
miller
but
not
by
much
its
the
go
to
beer
when
you
dont
want
to
drink
good
beer
great
lager
with
strong
beer
flavor
very
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
i
know
this
beer
has
a
long
storied
history
but
it
just
is
not
great
dark
goldcopper
color
with
thin
white
head
and
good
clarity
floral
notes
lite
floral
and
bread
with
sweet
malt
finish
very
drinkable
lager
old
faithful
when
you
want
a
beer
but
dont
want
to
get
craft
twisted
since
i
live
about
45
min
from
where
its
made
every
bar
around
has
yuengling
lager
on
tapand
at
a
good
price
its
normally
referred
to
as
lager
i
e
ill
have
a
lager
please
its
a
really
good
overall
beer
lots
of
flavor
goes
well
with
most
food
definitely
a
good
go
to
beer
overall
for
some
reason
people
love
this
beer
at
least
amongst
more
commercial
drinkers
and
especially
those
hailing
from
any
corner
of
pennsylvania
people
cant
seem
to
get
enough
i
guess
youve
gotta
root
for
the
hometeam
right
ehh
for
your
more
crafttilted
consumer
you
will
find
little
to
hang
your
hat
from
in
either
major
area
from
aroma
to
taste
this
is
your
classic
basic
simple
adjuncty
beer
with
a
slightly
danker
and
toasty
twinge
due
to
its
amber
background
thinking
honestly
here
most
of
you
reading
this
have
probably
had
a
yuengling
or
two
in
your
day
as
it
is
certainly
a
stepping
stone
into
the
craft
realm
having
rated
everything
else
available
at
our
hotel
bar
in
wilkesbarre
pennsylvania
we
took
this
as
a
rating
nightcap
as
wed
realized
we
hadnt
yet
written
it
up
yet
well
probably
grab
this
at
a
wedding
if
there
is
nothing
better
to
drink
be
it
either
malted
beverages
or
spirits
but
it
otherwise
wont
soon
meet
our
palate
shared
a
pitcher
while
bowling
this
really
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
considering
the
style
im
not
going
to
go
into
depth
describing
this
one
but
its
way
better
than
bmc
options
its
a
great
choice
when
the
options
are
very
limited
taste
is
practically
nonexistent
background
lager
flavor
at
best
my
goto
beer
when
i
dont
have
any
craft
brews
or
homemade
better
than
cheap
miller
or
bud
any
day
great
lager
one
of
my
favorites
pours
clear
amber
color
almost
no
head
smokycitrus
aroma
malty
flavor
thats
not
too
heavy
slight
lacing
this
beer
is
good
and
i
drink
it
often
since
its
widely
available
in
my
area
however
theres
a
malty
aftertaste
which
i
find
undesirable
so
i
cant
rate
this
one
too
highly
only
if
dehydration
is
beginning
to
be
life
threatening
decent
lager
that
has
a
more
substantial
character
than
budweiser
but
still
trashy
not
enjoyable
for
me
cheap
tastes
good
very
drinkable
good
alternative
to
the
big
three
breweries
was
always
my
beer
of
choice
until
i
started
experimenting
with
craft
beer
good
beer
as
far
as
cheaper
beers
go
this
one
could
be
worse
its
the
best
option
when
drinking
with
less
seasoned
beer
drinkers
old
faithful
here
used
to
be
my
everyday
beer
and
were
it
not
for
a
more
curious
beer
appetite
probably
still
would
be
easy
to
drink
tastes
much
better
than
anything
coming
out
of
st
louis
or
milwaukee
there
are
not
a
ton
of
different
flavors
to
decipher
as
you
drink
this
one
it
is
just
a
good
simple
smooth
drinking
beer
that
can
be
bought
most
places
for
pretty
close
to
the
cost
of
cheaper
light
beers
looks
like
america
but
it
feels
tastes
and
smells
like
college
overall
i
have
the
feels
classic
amber
lager
proud
from
pa
overall
this
is
an
decent
beer
one
that
i
enjoy
with
decent
nonoffensive
but
not
great
either
flavors
of
toasted
malt
corn
and
caramellike
sweetness
its
a
good
gateway
into
craft
beer
beer
a
good
golf
course
beer
a
good
tailgate
beer
and
a
good
nonbmc
restaurant
beer
ill
never
turn
one
down
but
im
not
picking
up
a
six
to
bring
home
either
good
beer
not
great
save
this
for
friends
who
do
not
appreciate
a
decent
craft
beer
its
a
great
beer
i
dont
care
what
you
say
overall
this
is
a
simple
but
tasty
lager
thats
available
damn
near
everywhere
for
the
same
price
youd
pay
for
something
like
budweiser
or
miller
lite
or
even
less
in
some
cases
without
the
im
giving
money
to
a
soulless
worldwide
megacorporation
guilt
you
might
feel
from
buying
one
of
those
beers
even
if
its
not
one
of
your
favorites
you
have
to
appreciate
that
theres
decent
beer
available
at
a
great
price
i
was
a
little
afraid
i
wouldnt
like
this
one
as
much
after
trying
some
of
the
great
beers
ive
stumbled
across
in
the
past
month
or
so
but
it
turns
out
i
had
nothing
to
worry
aboutif
anything
i
might
actually
appreciate
yuenglings
traditional
lager
a
little
more
now
than
i
did
back
before
id
tried
more
exotic
beers
like
belgian
dubbels
and
ipas
the
only
thing
id
ever
change
about
this
one
is
the
smell
because
yeah
thats
a
bit
funky
now
off
to
finish
the
rest
of
this
huge
can
it
is
a
middle
of
the
road
macro
lager
for
me
o
nice
and
easy
sessionable
american
amber
lager
thats
relatively
affordable
and
always
easy
to
get
i
really
cant
hate
on
it
sadly
i
cant
find
it
as
much
here
in
far
west
tx
this
used
to
be
my
goto
beer
in
college
but
now
that
ive
moved
from
georgia
to
missouri
i
can
no
longer
get
yuengling
easily
after
a
few
years
not
drinking
this
i
found
trying
it
again
refreshing
it
is
smooth
but
not
bland
making
it
the
type
of
beer
i
would
want
when
i
am
not
in
the
mood
for
anything
in
particular
one
of
my
first
beers
outside
of
miller
lite
thanks
for
helping
me
change
great
drinkable
every
day
beer
especially
good
on
tap
just
the
best
all
around
lager
when
balancing
taste
refreshingness
heaviness
and
cost
great
lager
for
an
everyday
beer
favorite
beer
of
mine
high
quality
fine
lager
better
then
bud
really
good
beer
from
pa
always
smell
and
taste
skunked
the
beer
was
pretty
good
this
smelled
and
tasted
like
a
skunks
ass
not
sure
if
that
is
normal
or
not
either
way
i
dont
care
because
i
would
never
have
another
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
why
anyone
would
choose
this
beer
with
so
many
better
options
out
there
great
nutty
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
very
basic
average
lager
not
very
flavorful
i
am
basing
this
beer
off
other
macro
lighter
lagers
out
there
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
very
drinkable
didnt
have
that
skunkpiss
flavor
that
most
of
these
lagers
carry
being
from
ca
i
dont
have
access
to
this
so
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
ill
never
stop
liking
yuengling
as
a
good
inexpensive
beer
it
was
my
goto
in
college
before
i
started
discovering
craft
beer
and
it
remains
a
beer
ill
drink
when
its
available
o
a
nice
example
of
the
style
thin
head
no
lacing
light
amber
color
aroma
of
a
slightly
skunky
grain
sweet
tasting
slight
hops
and
strong
carbonation
with
a
grainy
malty
taste
light
bodied
finishes
sweet
easy
best
cheap
beer
overall
well
it
was
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
it
wasnt
really
good
either
the
oldest
brewery
in
america
yuengling
might
be
but
in
my
humble
opinion
there
are
so
many
better
brews
out
there
i
might
try
one
again
in
a
few
years
when
ive
mostly
forgotten
how
mediocre
it
was
but
i
wont
be
coming
back
anytime
soon
well
unless
i
have
no
better
choices
like
i
didnt
have
tonight
similar
to
the
other
comments
here
i
used
to
drink
this
one
a
lot
in
my
youth
and
before
i
got
into
craft
beer
this
is
my
first
time
drinking
it
since
ive
been
rating
on
ba
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
very
clean
taste
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
not
much
via
aroma
perhaps
a
slight
malt
however
the
taste
has
a
good
deal
of
character
a
very
pleasant
change
of
pace
beer
i
give
it
a
4
25
because
even
though
it
is
my
favorite
i
still
reserve
higher
listings
for
truly
perfect
beers
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
the
current
dominant
american
craft
masterpiece
cheers
will
always
get
a
4
in
my
book
because
its
the
best
beer
for
your
price
that
money
can
buy
the
bar
i
frequently
go
to
and
watch
the
eagles
play
on
sundays
sells
2
domestic
beers
so
my
choices
are
bud
bud
lite
miller
lite
and
yuengling
its
not
even
a
question
i
take
yuengling
always
has
that
dark
amber
appearance
great
smell
great
taste
and
drinkablity
where
u
can
drink
them
all
day
long
any
time
i
complain
about
living
in
the
njpa
area
i
always
remember
i
have
access
to
cheap
lager
im
very
grateful
that
this
beer
has
become
a
yearround
delicacy
in
my
state
a
beer
thats
suitable
for
any
season
and
is
perfect
when
paired
with
a
burger
or
a
summertime
cookout
smorgasbord
a
quality
beer
for
6
a
sixer
you
cant
beat
that
yuengling
beer
is
not
meant
to
be
a
get
drunk
beer
its
meant
to
taste
great
i
go
to
department
stores
and
cant
always
find
something
good
in
a
case
its
always
a
12
pack
or
6
pack
i
got
a
case
of
samuel
adams
and
the
beer
was
to
strong
for
me
to
like
then
theres
the
36
packs
for
20
dollars
that
dont
have
a
good
taste
its
like
i
have
to
force
myself
to
drink
i
like
yuengling
because
its
in
the
middle
kind
of
disappointed
that
theres
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
it
but
hey
for
everything
else
its
good
dark
orange
amber
color
smell
is
a
little
hoppy
sweetish
malts
medium
carbonation
taste
is
malty
yet
strong
bold
hop
but
not
bitter
have
had
many
and
will
have
many
more
in
the
future
great
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
better
taste
than
coors
miller
and
bud
light
i
keep
a
stock
of
it
in
my
fridge
for
grilling
or
just
to
watch
football
games
overall
3
91
if
yuengling
traditional
was
sold
over
here
in
south
dakota
id
probably
be
buying
this
regularly
it
still
doesnt
beat
out
grain
belt
nordeast
as
its
a
little
more
watery
less
creamy
however
for
what
it
is
its
a
pretty
darn
good
amber
lager
this
is
my
go
to
cheaper
beer
easy
to
drink
and
great
taste
for
the
price
good
cheap
beer
finally
found
a
beer
that
i
can
actually
drink
enjoy
yuengling
is
simply
the
best
domestic
beer
available
regardless
of
can
bottle
or
keg
yuengling
is
a
standby
for
all
those
that
just
want
a
good
lager
good
cold
and
wet
kinda
beer
and
cant
really
beat
it
at
1718
pcase
after
taxes
perfect
session
beer
enough
flavor
to
make
it
worth
drinking
but
cheap
and
easy
to
pound
i
always
try
to
keep
yuenglings
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
good
beer
for
when
guests
come
over
nobody
doesnt
like
yuengling
and
its
cheap
would
absolutely
seek
out
and
purchase
again
unfortunately
it
is
not
sold
in
the
midwest
i
will
get
it
every
chance
i
get
though
better
on
tap
i
cant
get
lager
where
i
live
so
when
im
in
a
region
where
i
can
i
drink
it
like
its
my
job
floral
slightly
caramelly
sweet
malt
aroma
with
notes
of
toasted
bread
theres
a
metallic
note
along
with
light
green
apple
flavor
reveals
that
metallic
note
acetaldehyde
and
banana
underlying
throughout
toasted
notes
dominate
the
finish
upfront
theres
a
light
caramel
sweetness
lots
of
off
flavors
but
more
characterful
than
most
macros
walk
into
any
bar
in
philly
or
surrounding
areas
and
say
get
me
a
lager
and
this
is
what
youll
get
pleasantly
surprised
in
the
areas
its
available
this
is
an
excellent
alternative
to
the
bmc
lagers
its
cheap
easy
to
find
and
pleasant
enough
to
make
for
a
good
drinkable
goto
in
that
region
great
beer
if
you
live
in
the
northeastern
us
it
is
very
inexpensive
making
it
one
of
the
best
beers
per
dollar
and
my
go
to
drink
always
look
forward
to
going
to
clermont
florida
to
visit
my
bro
paul
for
our
annual
football
weekend
road
triptailgate
in
gainesville
there
i
drink
yuengling
all
weekend
and
love
it
sure
wish
we
could
get
it
in
texas
it
is
a
great
beer
for
an
american
mass
produced
product
simply
put
drinkability
easy
and
a
good
warm
weather
beer
ok
beer
it
does
bring
more
flavor
to
the
table
than
most
macro
brews
still
this
is
very
simple
and
sweet
not
a
rockstar
but
a
great
session
lager
for
any
occasion
it
has
a
light
body
and
crisp
flavor
but
it
is
not
pale
or
flavorless
a
favorite
in
pennsylvania
but
be
forwarned
do
not
order
as
a
yuengling
in
a
pennsylvania
bar
you
must
order
this
as
a
lager
or
risk
being
taunted
mercilously
it
beats
piss
water
beer
anyday
its
enjoyable
and
is
a
step
up
for
anyone
who
isnt
drinking
beer
just
go
get
plastered
definitely
a
great
casual
beerdrinker
beer
a
beer
i
can
have
on
hand
and
please
casual
beer
drinkers
clean
taste
not
heavy
a
good
out
and
about
everyday
beer
as
far
as
american
macrolagers
go
i
believe
that
this
is
the
best
certainly
much
better
than
the
big
three
and
are
any
of
those
american
anymore
anyway
this
has
been
my
lowest
common
denominator
for
some
time
my
goto
beer
when
i
stand
in
the
beer
isle
and
cant
decide
what
to
buy
the
best
thing
about
it
is
that
its
americas
oldest
family
owned
and
operated
brewery
thats
still
going
strong
after
all
these
years
taste
is
overall
really
good
in
that
you
can
actually
taste
this
beer
when
you
compare
it
to
something
like
bud
light
or
miller
great
low
cost
straight
up
lager
beer
like
budweiser
only
actually
good
they
still
sell
it
at
a
super
low
price
in
coal
country
in
pennsylvania
because
thats
who
supported
them
their
first
160
years
it
was
basically
a
local
brew
in
that
area
didnt
even
make
it
down
to
philly
until
they
came
out
with
black
and
tan
awesome
no
bs
session
beer
but
it
is
certainly
refreshing
always
a
go
to
for
me
local
guyenjoying
a
local
favorite
pours
an
orange
dark
yellow
with
a
very
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
pretty
subtle
with
mostly
toasted
malt
coming
through
but
also
some
citrus
the
taste
was
pretty
bland
to
be
honest
with
the
malt
coming
through
at
the
end
and
not
much
to
say
about
the
beginning
and
middle
soon
coming
to
ct
and
everyone
is
amped
for
it
but
i
just
cant
seem
to
understand
the
hype
my
first
my
last
my
everything
the
best
cheap
beer
youll
ever
drink
step
four
drink
it
with
friends
youll
be
less
inclined
to
notice
that
it
didnt
live
up
to
your
expectations
if
youre
all
out
there
in
a
field
drinking
beers
and
having
a
good
time
overall
this
was
absolutely
unfamiliar
to
me
a
few
years
ago
and
now
it
is
my
guilty
pleasure
anytime
i
visit
pennsylvania
although
it
has
been
said
before
ill
say
that
this
is
the
crappiest
beer
a
craft
drinker
can
enjoy
and
the
nicest
beer
a
macro
drinker
can
enjoy
this
to
me
is
the
perfect
american
adjunct
lager
when
i
visited
the
tour
in
pottsville
they
proudly
boasted
of
using
american
corn
grits
in
the
malt
bill
this
is
cheap
beer
done
right
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
has
a
beautiful
appearance
the
clean
crisp
finish
makes
you
beg
for
another
after
having
it
in
many
forms
i
personally
prefer
it
best
just
straight
from
the
can
when
confronted
with
these
choices
bud
lite
coors
lite
budweiser
yuengling
traditional
lager
at
a
recent
goingaway
party
for
a
new
sailor
i
chose
the
yuengling
traditional
lager
it
was
the
best
choice
by
far
i
had
never
had
it
before
and
thought
that
it
might
be
worth
sampling
i
was
so
surprised
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
american
lager
it
has
none
of
the
drawbacks
of
either
light
beers
with
their
insipid
weak
socalled
flavor
nor
the
nasty
aftertaste
of
budweisers
king
of
beers
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
to
have
a
good
standard
american
lager
on
hand
it
tastes
great
has
a
nice
full
feel
and
a
wonderfully
clean
finish
secret
its
a
lot
better
than
pbr
appearance
is
a
reddish
copper
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
contain
the
blend
of
malts
with
a
touch
of
corny
sweetness
the
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
too
long
and
is
a
touch
unpleasant
pa
pride
and
a
damn
good
beer
one
of
the
first
few
beers
i
had
one
which
i
think
anyone
from
pa
was
probably
introduced
to
early
nothing
bad
about
it
looks
smells
and
taste
great
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
in
pa
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
lager
and
this
is
what
you
get
to
most
this
is
the
one
the
beer
looks
better
than
it
smells
feels
or
tastes
my
most
recent
drinking
experience
was
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
but
i
personally
seem
to
prefer
this
beer
from
the
tap
one
of
the
first
beers
i
remember
actually
enjoying
these
days
on
my
trips
back
to
pa
i
find
myself
drinking
yuengling
out
of
a
can
i
grew
up
drinking
yuengling
in
a
bottle
but
the
can
seems
to
have
a
better
taste
it
may
be
time
for
yuengling
to
switch
to
a
brown
bottle
summer
in
a
can
o
for
what
it
is
its
good
it
kicks
the
tar
out
of
budweiser
and
competes
at
the
same
price
point
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
on
the
market
craft
beer
geeks
will
never
be
wowed
by
the
style
but
it
gives
you
a
better
option
when
youre
out
at
the
dive
bar
down
the
street
yuengling
is
a
good
beer
in
comparison
to
mass
produced
beers
like
coors
or
bud
it
tastes
weak
compared
to
good
craft
beers
its
really
all
in
comparison
as
to
how
good
you
think
it
is
if
you
are
used
to
drinking
10
dollar
a
six
pack
craft
beer
its
going
to
be
bland
if
you
drink
run
of
the
mill
beers
it
is
going
to
be
a
joy
to
drink
and
have
a
lot
of
flavor
over
all
better
than
nothing
o
like
i
said
before
this
one
is
a
goto
for
a
cheap
beer
when
you
have
to
beer
and
cant
find
something
interesting
leagues
behind
other
basic
craft
beer
staples
like
fat
tire
boston
lager
or
maybe
even
magic
hat
though
im
not
a
big
fan
of
that
beers
fruit
flavors
but
i
digress
while
being
a
thousand
times
better
than
your
average
macrolager
id
even
pick
this
one
over
some
macro
imports
like
newcastle
becks
stella
or
carlsberg
yuengling
lager
is
my
goto
beer
when
i
want
something
good
but
not
special
i
found
this
beer
after
moving
to
florida
they
have
a
brewery
in
tampa
yet
many
local
bars
still
charge
import
price
for
it
worlds
better
than
budmillercoors
it
is
a
bit
skunky
likely
due
to
the
green
bottles
with
a
taste
that
reminds
me
of
cardboard
only
in
a
good
way
there
is
a
bit
of
hop
but
the
primary
taste
is
malt
i
found
it
makes
a
mean
blackandtan
with
guinness
draft
notes
this
one
is
a
very
straight
forward
and
an
easy
drinking
lager
cheers
got
a
case
of
this
on
a
recent
trip
to
pa
i
sure
remember
it
being
better
than
this
this
lager
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
left
almost
no
lacing
the
nose
was
overly
sweet
just
like
its
other
mass
produced
contemporaries
flavor
was
sweet
and
simple
no
complexity
just
your
average
big
brewery
lager
flavor
mouthfeel
was
light
and
easy
to
drink
these
arent
bad
beers
and
can
definitely
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
day
but
after
having
dived
deep
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
they
just
dont
deliver
the
flavor
and
complexity
that
i
crave
o
its
all
about
expectations
if
youre
looking
for
a
bright
bold
lager
bursting
with
flavor
and
full
of
intrigue
youre
going
to
be
profoundly
disappointed
if
you
think
that
yuengling
is
just
another
bland
fizzy
watery
american
lager
then
youre
likely
to
be
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
beer
with
just
enough
going
for
it
to
make
it
appealing
to
thirsty
craft
beer
lovers
who
somehow
find
themselves
stuck
in
a
bmc
bar
its
an
unpretentious
brew
that
wont
sweep
you
off
your
feet
but
definitely
holds
its
own
and
then
some
against
the
majority
of
macros
out
there
yuengling
is
a
good
economical
choice
if
youre
throwing
a
shindig
and
want
to
introduce
bmc
drinkers
to
something
else
overall
good
allpurpose
allseasons
lager
good
for
cookouts
parties
hangouts
and
the
like
pairs
well
with
any
meal
its
not
mindblowing
but
it
doesnt
have
to
be
and
the
price
is
spoton
this
is
a
great
beer
before
i
knew
about
craft
beer
i
knew
that
i
liked
yuengling
because
of
the
story
behind
the
brewery
and
the
family
that
has
been
doing
it
i
come
from
maryland
and
a
lot
of
my
friends
drink
this
religiously
and
i
dont
mind
when
i
come
to
visit
great
session
beer
o
overall
great
lighter
lager
that
is
perfect
for
when
you
dont
want
a
heavy
and
overly
complex
sipper
but
just
want
something
light
and
refreshing
is
it
intricate
and
nuanced
no
is
it
light
and
delicious
yes
recommended
yuengling
traditional
lager
brewed
by
yuengling
brewery
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
4
4
and
it
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
also
this
brew
has
a
small
white
head
this
is
a
filtered
brew
with
some
carbonation
you
can
see
right
though
it
i
like
the
look
of
this
brew
yuengling
is
a
amberred
lager
not
an
american
style
lager
the
smell
is
ok
you
pick
up
aromas
of
grasses
grains
and
richness
there
is
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
taste
is
smooth
and
rich
with
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
bold
with
flavor
but
it
is
smooth
and
rich
there
is
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
brew
yuengling
traditional
lager
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
mouthfeel
is
nice
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
this
brew
is
also
crisp
and
clean
over
ll
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
of
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again
o
solid
beer
im
happy
this
one
is
on
the
market
for
when
styles
i
might
prefer
arent
available
or
are
too
pricy
o
a
very
drinkable
refreshing
beer
with
sweet
and
toasty
flavors
a
good
goto
beer
when
in
desire
of
something
drinkable
and
not
overpowering
highly
recommended
overall
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
appearance
but
a
pretty
good
simple
lager
that
compares
well
to
the
big
guys
best
to
drink
this
one
cold
with
food
like
hamburgers
hot
dogs
etc
o
very
easy
to
drink
but
pretty
thoroughly
unremarkable
i
prefer
it
over
your
standard
bmc
but
cannot
suggest
much
more
than
that
i
have
to
give
this
beer
tops
all
the
way
my
virgin
tastebuds
thought
it
was
chinese
because
before
i
knew
better
i
thought
it
was
and
tasted
outside
of
the
now
awful
usual
budlight
97
of
the
losers
surrounding
me
drank
i
found
it
on
tap
at
my
favorite
wateringhole
for
3pint
back
in
2012
maybe
it
was
the
price
but
we
began
a
relationship
that
brought
me
to
new
highs
i
visited
the
tampa
brewery
back
then
and
really
like
the
fact
it
was
a
family
that
just
grew
with
the
demand
it
wasnt
a
corporate
brand
and
to
me
it
seemed
like
a
good
thing
that
did
it
the
right
way
i
could
go
on
about
why
i
love
yuengling
but
to
me
this
beer
has
a
place
in
my
heart
it
will
always
be
my
goto
beer
and
thats
why
it
deserves
55
all
the
way
it
has
a
slight
toasted
and
subtle
caramel
flavor
you
could
drink
it
all
day
and
not
go
overboard
it
puts
you
in
the
right
place
the
story
behind
it
and
the
ever
expanding
dreams
of
production
make
it
taste
better
on
tap
in
the
bottle
or
poured
into
my
180
year
anniversary
commemorative
glass
it
all
tastes
good
its
more
american
than
any
beer
out
there
its
the
oldest
beer
and
its
quintessentially
whatever
that
means
the
lifeblood
of
patriots
who
know
a
good
time
to
me
theres
beers
ill
like
new
tastes
ill
enjoy
but
theyll
always
be
yuengling
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
crisp
with
a
thin
watery
body
mild
carbonation
and
a
grainy
aftertaste
thats
on
the
clean
and
crisp
side
overall
a
good
cheap
session
beer
thats
much
better
than
most
macro
lagers
more
folks
began
to
offer
ygl
and
it
can
still
be
found
on
tap
in
a
lot
of
places
in
central
alabama
this
has
become
my
go
to
beer
as
it
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
have
a
high
abv
it
has
a
beautiful
head
that
doesnt
last
it
smells
like
it
tastes
which
is
a
good
balance
between
malt
and
hops
bitter
and
sweet
with
an
amber
ale
finish
there
are
better
beers
but
theyre
not
nearby
theyre
prohibitively
expensive
for
daily
consumption
or
their
alcohol
content
makes
for
an
early
evening
so
while
i
enjoy
the
belgians
and
germans
etc
yuengling
can
be
found
almost
everywhere
and
i
like
it
after
a
long
day
yuengling
stands
out
from
other
big
american
lagers
with
its
maltier
smell
and
taste
it
also
seems
to
have
somewhat
more
of
a
slight
bitterfunky
kick
thats
all
well
and
good
but
personally
i
dont
find
this
beer
that
tasty
or
even
that
refreshing
as
other
lagers
can
be
its
just
meh
all
around
and
the
fact
that
i
only
see
it
served
in
ice
cold
bottles
doesnt
really
do
it
any
favors
either
overall
pretty
much
what
i
expected
nice
brew
to
have
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
nice
session
lager
for
a
bbq
or
outdoors
event
nothing
too
special
overall
this
beer
has
become
my
go
to
while
trying
to
balance
taste
availability
and
cost
yuengling
traditional
lager
finds
its
way
into
my
fridge
quit
often
for
the
money
this
beer
is
hard
to
beat
this
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
grains
that
puts
off
a
little
bit
of
a
cheap
musty
beer
smell
the
taste
is
pretty
bold
with
grains
but
not
the
most
appealing
to
the
taste
buds
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
sour
twang
flavor
in
the
middle
that
doesnt
appeal
to
me
but
gives
yuengling
that
distinct
flavor
that
differs
it
from
bud
and
miller
products
at
generally
the
same
price
in
the
market
place
pours
a
rich
amber
color
about
a
one
finger
head
that
faded
quickly
and
not
any
lace
to
speak
of
light
fresh
smell
of
roasted
malt
taste
of
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
also
very
dry
mouthfeel
light
crisp
lots
of
carbonation
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
this
beer
and
this
is
my
first
time
and
i
will
buy
again
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
its
taste
is
very
appealing
and
would
drink
a
lot
more
it
smells
like
a
good
beer
and
tastes
like
a
good
beer
i
really
suck
at
this
review
stuff
but
honestly
its
a
damn
good
beer
and
i
would
much
rather
drink
this
over
bud
light
any
day
i
would
classify
this
beer
as
a
great
family
gathering
beer
though
it
sports
a
sparse
diminishing
head
the
medium
amber
color
is
very
appealing
yuenglings
light
body
and
smooth
mouthfeel
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
light
beer
enthusiasts
while
the
unique
lightly
toasted
grain
flavor
could
satisfy
many
in
the
craft
beer
crowd
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
not
yet
distributed
in
michigan
only
adds
to
its
allure
my
older
brother
and
father
love
this
beer
every
time
we
get
together
my
brother
brings
my
dad
a
six
pack
i
finally
had
to
try
it
for
myself
and
i
must
say
i
do
enjoy
it
nothing
really
spectacular
stands
out
but
overall
its
just
a
pretty
decent
beer
its
relatively
inexpensive
and
for
the
price
i
think
its
a
good
enough
light
beer
to
purchase
overall
a
great
go
between
beer
to
serve
from
a
keg
at
gettogethers
it
is
mainstream
enough
for
the
light
beer
crowd
but
substantial
enough
to
satisfy
all
but
the
most
extreme
beer
snobs
i
was
given
a
few
bottles
of
this
but
research
says
this
in
an
inexpensive
beer
assuming
that
to
be
true
for
the
price
this
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
that
is
going
to
outdo
the
really
nice
craft
beers
but
an
easy
drinking
and
fairly
flavorful
beer
it
just
tries
to
be
a
decent
easy
to
drink
beer
at
a
good
price
and
it
succeeds
in
meeting
that
goal
overall
very
clean
and
tasty
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
a
lot
better
than
i
remembered
i
will
try
it
from
a
bottle
or
can
and
if
it
still
holds
up
i
may
have
this
as
a
regular
affordable
beer
oa
personal
favorite
a
definite
go
to
affordable
beer
doesnt
get
much
better
for
the
price
yuengling
is
my
favorite
marco
brewed
larger
so
far
ive
had
in
both
in
the
bottle
and
poured
into
glasses
it
only
produces
a
small
head
when
poured
the
appearance
is
light
in
color
and
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
taste
this
is
the
beer
you
will
see
me
drink
most
often
a
winner
in
my
book
overall
this
brew
is
great
for
what
it
is
its
the
best
tasting
adjunct
brew
to
date
when
yuengling
first
started
distributing
in
oh
i
was
all
over
it
a
great
cheap
brew
that
makes
ab
and
mc
taste
like
rice
and
corn
i
buy
it
all
the
time
my
favorite
mass
produced
domestic
brew
so
to
speak
are
there
better
beers
yes
but
not
for
this
price
ab
and
mc
six
packs
go
for
6
29
in
my
area
easy
decision
o
i
should
say
that
american
adjunct
lagers
are
not
my
style
of
beer
having
said
that
i
think
that
this
beer
was
less
offensive
than
most
i
could
see
how
this
could
be
thirst
quenching
on
a
hot
summers
day
but
there
is
not
much
flavor
or
complexity
here
o
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
the
standard
abmillercoors
lager
but
despite
the
darker
color
lacking
in
malts
my
go
to
any
time
beer
a
truly
attractive
lager
overall
an
american
classic
and
a
beer
ive
really
been
looking
forward
to
trying
if
this
was
distrod
in
my
area
i
would
definitely
use
it
as
my
goto
cheap
beer
or
party
beer
this
has
much
more
flavor
than
bmc
macros
but
is
competitively
priced
with
those
sorts
of
beers
a
beer
everyone
should
have
at
least
once
if
just
for
the
history
of
it
this
is
the
best
american
macro
lager
ive
had
but
it
falls
short
of
greatness
overall
the
beer
is
a
super
refreshing
lager
light
hop
presence
in
taste
and
smell
in
my
area
yuengling
or
its
normally
called
lager

o
well
its
not
bad
i
still
prefer
my
gansett
lager
or
schlitz
as
a
go
to
cheap
session
type
brew
but
i
understand
why
people
living
in
pa
have
a
regional
fondness
of
this
beer
in
the
end
however
its
really
just
an
average
beer
but
definitely
a
step
above
a
macro
lager
like
any
beer
though
it
has
its
place
and
time
cheers
granted
its
not
mind
blowing
or
life
changing
but
if
im
going
to
have
a
nonmacro
offering
thats
closer
in
flavor
profile
to
beers
belonging
to
macro
companies
rather
than
one
belonging
to
the
recent
wave
of
delicious
lagers
that
have
flooded
the
craft
market
as
of
late
this
will
be
the
one
i
will
in
indulge
in
simple
yet
well
built
in
sweetness
graininess
and
even
bitterness
i
do
wish
we
got
this
beer
out
west
whenever
i
had
the
craving
for
a
beer
of
its
type
overall
having
moved
to
pa
i
feel
like
i
now
must
appreciate
yuengling
by
default
though
i
enjoyed
plenty
of
yuengling
before
moving
to
the
state
a
cut
above
bmc
in
my
book
overall
its
ok
for
an
amber
lager
but
certainly
better
than
comparably
priced
bmc
swill
it
has
some
character
albeit
mild
character
it
can
grow
a
little
sweet
after
one
or
two
bottles
but
i
think
the
same
can
be
said
about
most
lagers
particularly
ambers
appears
a
very
light
amber
color
clear
with
a
thin
head
smells
bready
with
hints
of
alcohol
taste
is
light
malt
forward
with
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
light
mouthfeel
very
simple
and
very
little
hop
character
this
used
to
be
a
novelty
beer
for
me
when
you
couldnt
get
it
around
here
and
my
pennsylvanian
friends
would
import
it
now
that
its
in
every
drug
store
its
just
a
decent
cheap
beer
to
put
in
the
fridge
when
my
brother
in
law
is
coming
over
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
good
clarity
and
a
head
of
loose
but
creamy
foam
that
falls
fast
nose
is
enticing
with
a
light
sweet
grain
a
touch
herbal
and
grass
plus
a
bit
of
light
citrus
faintly
in
the
background
the
taste
is
darn
good
this
beer
has
a
mouthfeel
that
is
light
and
thin
but
a
flavor
that
is
very
full
the
citrus
stays
int
he
background
and
the
bitterness
from
the
grass
is
light
the
sweet
grain
comes
close
to
caramel
but
stops
appropriately
and
stays
a
crisp
and
very
clean
lager
sweet
grassy
and
light
with
plenty
of
flavor
you
could
drink
this
all
day
you
know
yuengling
amber
brown
in
color
with
quarter
inch
thick
white
head
light
caramel
and
pale
malt
is
what
i
get
from
the
aroma
the
mouth
is
somewhat
creamy
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
front
of
the
palate
is
caramel
and
light
malt
with
just
a
bit
of
buttering
hops
and
the
creamy
smooth
lagered
finish
its
got
a
very
robust
taste
no
bad
after
taste
at
all
foams
nicely
when
poured
in
a
glass
goes
down
smooth
every
time
all
in
all
a
terrific
beer
especially
for
the
price
id
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
yuengling
is
a
beer
for
all
seasons
robust
enough
for
the
cold
months
and
refreshing
enough
for
the
heatwaves
beautiful
crispness
and
bite
with
each
swig
and
a
nice
amber
color
to
complement
a
beautiful
pour
but
forget
that
man
this
is
enjoyed
right
from
the
bottle
when
its
ice
cold
it
is
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
as
it
warms
you
get
more
of
the
hop
bite
which
is
pretty
cool
definitely
a
beer
you
can
drink
12
of
or
enjoy
with
a
meal
yuengling
is
a
terrific
beer
in
my
opinion
a
perfect
beer
i
could
drink
this
year
round
living
in
the
northeast
the
scarcity
and
mystique
of
it
only
adds
to
its
legend
my
favorite
beer
no
question
this
is
one
of
the
finest
everyday
american
lagers
around
do
yourself
a
favor
and
barter
for
a
bottle
if
youve
never
had
it
displaced
locals
will
forever
long
for
the
lager
overall
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
am
sure
most
everyone
has
tried
this
beer
it
is
a
dark
amber
color
it
has
a
distinct
taste
yet
it
goes
down
smooth
with
no
bitterness
balanced
profile
great
with
wings
burgers
and
pizza
a
great
beer
for
watching
football
its
inexpensive
and
is
easy
to
drink
o
easy
drinking
lager
with
more
flavor
than
your
average
bmc
yuengling
is
my
favorite
beer
its
relatively
cheap
when
compared
to
most
of
the
more
popular
beers
out
there
but
vastly
superior
its
a
regional
beer
and
hard
to
find
away
from
the
mideast
usa
its
an
amber
beer
and
surprisingly
smoother
and
better
than
most
of
your
standard
variety
gasstation
beers
great
with
food
or
just
to
get
buzzed
beer
feel
isnt
very
full
very
watery
definitely
a
favorite
out
of
all
macrobrews
for
its
drinkability
and
relatively
good
taste
o
as
far
as
light
bodied
american
lagers
go
this
one
is
pretty
good
it
cost
the
same
as
bud
but
has
a
bit
more
flavor
and
comes
from
a
historic
family
owned
brewery
if
you
have
the
choice
go
with
this
over
any
bmc
product
except
maybe
bourbon
county
varieties
i
appreciate
what
is
considered
to
be
americass
oldest
brew
there
is
a
bit
of
nostalgia
in
it
for
me
as
i
experienced
a
yuengling
on
a
spring
break
trip
with
an
uncle
that
is
no
longer
living
smooth
taste
that
leaves
no
bad
after
taste
and
the
tradition
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
i
look
for
it
and
when
i
find
it
i
usually
get
a
sixer
i
am
native
to
pennsylvania
so
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
go
to
beer
when
times
are
tough
pours
with
a
nice
head
that
dissipates
quickly
no
lace
color
is
amber
and
slightly
transparent
taste
is
kinda
grainy
and
watered
down
with
a
slight
after
taste
of
hop
goes
down
smooth
family
owned
brewery
for
over
178
years
better
than
most
popular
american
lagers
overall
good
beer
taste
is
slightly
malted
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
seem
to
taste
a
very
very
slight
bit
of
barley
very
smooth
going
down
great
for
a
barbeque
or
sporting
event
or
low
budget
refreshment
one
of
the
first
beers
i
had
that
wasnt
a
bmc
this
is
my
goto
beer
when
im
low
on
funds
but
still
need
to
drink
something
with
flavor
i
realize
its
not
comparable
to
any
craft
brew
but
its
light
years
ahead
of
a
typical
aal
the
flavor
is
there
but
it
almost
disappears
before
you
realize
it
was
there
the
flavor
is
almost
smokey
but
still
smooth
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
what
you
would
get
if
you
added
a
few
ounces
of
water
to
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
overall
a
good
buy
and
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
opportunity
o
i
grew
up
in
western
pa
and
this
is
my
personal
go
to
beer
when
nothing
better
available
or
i
go
for
the
collage
days
nostalgia
way
better
than
any
other
lite
beer
and
you
know
what
you
are
getting
generally
never
great
but
never
bad
bottled
is
my
first
choice
cans
taste
strong
maybe
because
of
the
aluminum
and
drafts
very
rarely
taste
flat
but
still
drinkable

being

the

ranks

below

the
label
reminds
us
this
beer
was
pioneered
when
colors
amber
in
this
case
were
the
distinguishing
aspect
of
the
industry
overall
this
is
the
beer
you
chose
when
youre
parched
after
a
day
in
the
yard
and
need
to
chug
a
few
to
quench
the
thirst
its
by
no
means
a
thinking
beer
its
far
better
than
the
bmc
crowd
but
cant
hold
a
candle
to
most
craft
offerings
if
you
happen
to
like
this
enjoy
it
and
know
the
brewery
is
a
family
owned
operation
good
people
and
does
a
lot
for
their
community
i
used
to
travel
to
the
coast
and
down
to
florida
to
get
a
draft
yuengling
it
was
worth
the
trip
the
beer
pours
a
good
amber
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
food
and
it
feels
good
holding
it
in
my
mouth
for
a
short
swallow
i
dont
drink
american
beer
as
a
rule
but
there
are
a
couple
of
regionals
that
i
always
enjoyed
and
this
is
one
i
hope
mass
producing
it
doesnt
ruin
it
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
not
great
but
for
a
buck
during
happy
hour
you
can
eat
some

streaming
up
from

of

actually
the

the
taste

pretty

the
same
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
very
easy
to
drink
no
harsh
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
medium
bodied
this
is
something
they
do
really
well
on
this
beer
it
is
lightly
creamy
yet
refreshing
overall
just
like
any
other
aal
but
with
caramel
coloring
added
yuengling
is
my
goto
beer
of
choice
it
is
a
great
allaround
lager
in
fact
where
i
grew
up
in
eastern
pa
the
words
yuengling
and
lager
are
pretty
much
interchangeable
im
happy
that
it
is
now
brewed
in
florida
as
well
though
i
have
concerns
that
the
taste
will
be
different
possibly
due
to
the
water
used
will
have
to
see
all
this
gave
these
guys
a
huge
sense
of
prideand
yuengling
brewery
has
that
same
kind
of
pride
when
it
comes
to
making
their
beersthere
is
not
one
other
american
macro
brewed
beer
that
taste
anything
like
a
yuenglingit
is
very
distinctiveand
taste
more
like
a
euro
lager
then
a
standard
american
brewed
macro
lagerand
imhoit
is
more
or
less
impossible
to
beat

wise
in
its

rangedollar
for

get
a
very
well
crafted
macro
lager
for
your
money

yuenglingand
i
have
to
give
this
brewery
a
lot
of
respecta
lot
of
respect
indeedbecause
i
think
yuengling
is
in
a
league
all
its
owncheers
as
much
as
i
love
to
expand
my
beer
horizons
with
craft
beers
at
times
yuengling
traditional
lager
is
always
my
goto
beer
where
i
live
if
you
ask
for
a
lager
you
get
a
yuengling
by
default
it
has
a
great
combination
of
taste
and
smell
and
it
is
a
relatively
smooth
beer
to
drink
which
makes
for
an
easily
drinkable
beer
without
sacrificing
flavor
every
time
i
meet
people
that
do
not
yet
have
yuengling
in
their
part
of
the
country
they
always
want
to
bring
some
home
o
just
try
this
beer
it
never
disappoints
a
true
classic
that
the
states
can
be
proud
of
i
know
that
larger
breweries
tend
to
get
very
negative
reviews
but
this
beer
in
my
opinion
is
by
far
the
best
beer
for
the
money
what
more
can
you
ask
for
in
a
beer
that
costs
the
same
as
bud
light
it
is
also
easily
found
in
stores
at
least
here
in
tampa
where
they
have
their
second
brewery
i
am
not
affiliated
with
the
company
but
sincerely
think
this
is
the
best
beer
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
the
color
smell
taste
and
carbonation
is
near
perfect
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
sometimes
i
drink
it
out
of
a
glass
and
other
times
i
drink
it
out
of
the
bottle
when
i
go
to
a
restaurant
that
has
it
on
tap
i
get
it
on
tap
and
it
is
awesome
dont
get
me
wrong
i
also
enjoy
local
brews
and
microbreweries
but
this
is
my
go
to
beer
cheers
this
beer
sucks
something
awful
when
people
bring
cases
of
it
to
my
house
for
parties
i
make
sure
they
take
the
leftovers
with
them
drinkability
there
is
not
much
to
it
really
but
it
does
offer
flavor
and
is
very
quaffable
i
was
so
lucky
to
live
where
this
was
readily
available
its
so
much
better
then
the
standard
beers
that
are
available
but
it
is
priced
similarly
for
the
price
you
cant
beat
it
if
youre
in
the
area
give
it
a
try
and
see
what
youre
missing
out
on
by
drinking
bud
coors
whatever
i
am
a
craft
beer
lover
but
first
and
formost
i
love
beer
this
is
actually
not
a
bad
lager
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
non
offensive
if
you
must
drink
a
lager
and
all
macros
are
the
only
thing
available
i
would
drink
this
and
be
happy
about
it
not
quite
as
good
as
sam
adams
but
a
very
close
second
lagersgive
me
an
elliot
ness
or
prima
pils
or
dortmunder
gold
miles
ahead
of
bmc
still
well
behind
good
craft
beers
it
is
excellent
at
what
it
is
an
alternative
to
mass
produced
american
light
beer
swill
has
a
sulphury
taste
to
it
i
dont
like
other
than
that
guzzle
up
its
what
you
drink
when
youre
out
of
college
and
need
to
appear
matured
but
just
want
to
get
trashed
crisp
and
clean
easy
drinking
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
as
i
stated
previously
i
do
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
when
having
some
with
my
friends
it
is
certainly
not
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
rather
it
is
my
go
to
drink
a
lot
and
have
a
good
night
beer
i
personally
know
many
people
who
are
not
into
craft
beer
who
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
cheers
overall
a
really
welldone
easy
drinking
beer
and
without
the
weird
chemical
flavors
you
get
in
some
of
the
macros
mostly
sweet
caramel
and
malt
on
the
nose
with
a
tinge
of
banana
and
cheap
beer
smell
maybe
a
tiny
hint
of
roast
as
well
fairly
layered
and
complex
for
a
beer
in
the
cheapass
lager
category
the
flavor
here
seems
somewhat
lacking
compared
to
what
the
nose
offers
there
is
only
a
small
bit
of
that
sweet
caramel
up
front
but
that
flavor
soon
turns
to
a
slightly
sour
cardboard
impression
that
lasts
throughout
the
lengthy
finish
overall
one
of
the
best
to
choose
in
my
area
for
a
cheap
beer
is
not
a
very
flavorful
beer
but
that
keeps
it
light
and
doesnt
taste
bad
yuengling
is
a
beer
you
gotta
pour
a
little
hard
to
get
a
decent
head
but
it
will
pour
bubbley
white
head
that
dies
down
to
thin
ring
its
very
brown
copper
color
also
clear
see
thru
it
smells
carmal
grains
citrus
moslty
a
grain
smell
though
the
taste
is
very
smooth
a
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
carmal
and
more
grain
i
used
to
be
able
to
tatse
more
corn
grits
in
this
but
not
so
much
now
a
little
more
bitter
then
ur
nomal
adjunt
with
a
little
carbantion
bite
and
a
tade
of
the
citrus
throuh
the
swallow
i
think
if
u
can
get
yuengling
theres
really
no
need
for
any
other
cheap
adjunt
beer
this
beer
tatse
awsome
is
easy
to
drink
light
but
more
body
then
the
norm
and
very
cheap
i
seen
it
cheaper
then
miller
lite
most
of
the
time
draft
cans
bottles
pour
it
in
a
glass
or
drink
it
straight
out
of
the
can
or
bottle
its
good
ethier
way
when
you
first
crack
open
a
can
of
yeungling
traditional
lager
you
hear
the
hiss
of
the
carbonation
escaping
into
fresh
air
the
tightly
sealed
sacred
nectar
awaiting
the
thick
foamy
lager
is
a
must
for
any
season
upon
taking
your
first
sip
you
can
feel
the
carbonation
tart
your
tounge
in
sourness
overall
its
a
great
beer
while
not
a
summer
craft
or
seasonal
sam
adams
it
tops
my
list
as
3
of
my
all
time
favorite
summer
beers
for
the
price
you
cannot
do
better
than
yuengling
its
straightforward
but
it
has
a
good
flavor
its
as
good
of
a
lager
as
youre
going
to
find
overall
an
american
mass
beer
classic
and
if
i
had
my
way
the
only
mass
beer
wed
export
45
o
not
sure
why
others
have
rated
it
so
low
i
believe
that
anyone
that
is
west
of
the
lucky
states
that
get
it
see
it
as
such
a
rarity
that
it
is
a
delicacy
well
im
here
to
tell
you
i
have
been
having
it
for
about
three
years
now
and
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
bottom
line
have
a
party
have
the
yueng
this
beer
is
like
sitting
in
the
cheap
seats
at
world
series
game
7
it
is
what
it
is
you
get
to
be
there
but
part
of
you
wishes
you
had
just
watched
it
from
your
old
recliner
ok
taste
real
easy
to
drink
but
no
character
will
i
drink
it
again
ya
i
love
beer
am
i
counting
the
hours
down
until
then
nope
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
old
habits
are
hard
to
break
but
i
feel
like
yuengling
has
some
real
craft
beer
qualities
despite
the
price
o
can
not
be
beat
for
what
it
is
o
being
from
pennsylvania
if
you
go
to
bar
namely
one
that
doesnt
specialize
in
craft
brews
and
ask
for
a
lager
a
cold
yuengling
is
what
youll
get
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
i
am
100
okay
with
drinking
this
one
most
of
my
buddies
dont
go
to
craft
bars
so
yuengling
is
typically
my
savior
from
the
bmc
light
beers
take
yuengling
for
what
it
is
a
basic
lager
that
is
light
years
ahead
of
most
macros
in
quality
and
drinkability
american
owned
means
a
lot
to
me
and
the
big
beer
companies
are
no
longer
take
pride
in
their
beer
unlike
yuengling
which
does
o
not
a
fan
and
i
think
this
beer
would
be
rated
much
lower
without
all
the
rampant
homerism
from
the
pa
residents
ive
had
it
in
a
bottle
on
tap
warm
cold
frozen
everything
it
is
a
staple
here
and
im
so
glad
to
have
it
if
your
from
pa
and
go
to
a
bar
and
say
you
want
a
lager
expect
to
get
yuengling
traditional
anyways
when
poured
it
comes
out
in
my
glass
with
an
amber
brownish
color
following
a
nice
head
even
the
head
tastes
good
without
it
being
overpowering
in
the
glass
but
it
definitely
lets
you
know
its
there
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
a
good
lager
hints
of
barley
malts
and
something
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
tastewise
i
may
get
some
ball
busting
for
this
but
to
me
it
tastes
like
if
sam
adams
boston
lager
had
a
baby
with
miller
genuine
draft
very
well
brewed
with
some
bite
to
it
through
the
bottles
there
isnt
too
much
carbonation
so
it
works
well
in
the
mouth
overall
yuengling
traditional
amber
lager
is
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
there
arent
any
other
beers
i
would
drive
200mi
there
and
back
to
buy
or
pay
extra
for
someone
else
to
get
for
me
easily
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
drank
if
given
the
chance
i
do
recommend
trying
yuengling
lager
you
wont
regret
it
overall
like
mentioned
earlier
its
never
going
to
rock
anyones
world
or
make
any
top
beer
lists
but
sometimes
simple
and
cheap
is
all
thats
necessary
for
a
night
of
enjoyment
take
something
for
what
it
is
and
be
realistic
and
you
too
can
enjoy
the
simple
things
in
life
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
as
my
expectations
werent
all
that
high
an
enjoyable
lager
that
i
woudlnt
mind
having
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
ill
try
and
keep
my
pa
and
bias
out
of
this
review
i
used
to
drink
this
throughout
college
and
growing
up
now
as
a
real
review
the
beer
is
pretty
average
and
good
overall
brew
to
have
for
a
party
one
finger
head
that
quickly
expires
after
a
few
minutes
almost
zero
head
retention
no
real
noticeable
smell
a
little
malt
some
floral
notes
i
guess
almost
a
chemical
type
nose
and
mouthfeel
i
get
large
carbonation
feel
and
aftertaste
almost
seems
to
transition
to
a
watery
taste
maybe
my
tolerance
is
now
sky
high
but
it
tastes
more
like
2
i
get
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
some
dryness
its
very
drinkable
like
i
said
a
good
party
beer
decent
and
inexpensive
brings
me
back
to
my
college
years
yuengling
traditional
could
be
accurately
characterized
as
a
vienna
style
beer
i
think
an
amber
hue
a
bit
heavier
than
a
lager
but
still
refreshing
and
suitable
for
my
own
house
beer
it
was
once
available
only
within
a
limited
area
from
pottsville
pa
now
i
am
finding
it
all
over
the
country
where
you
find
this
beer
at
normal
premium
beer
prices
like
bud
and
other
typical
american
lagers
it
is
an
excellent
bargain
i
find
it
selling
at
import
prices
in
some
parts
of
the
country
but
it
is
considered
local
beer
around
baltimore
making
it
pretty
irresistable
as
an
allrounder
daily
brew
o
nothing
special
going
on
in
the
nose
or
feel
but
decent
flavor
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
simple
and
inexpensive
great
everyday
goto
beer
the
new
but
old
budweiser
at
least
they
didnt
sell
out
to
a
foreign
company
it
has
a
full
bodied
taste
without
being
over
powering
goes
down
smooth
and
clean
we
used
to
be
bud
light
folks
but
now
we
are
true
blue
yuengling
fans
pours
a
dark
ambergold
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
smells
mostly
of
grain
not
much
else
taste
is
what
youd
expect
from
a
beer
like
this
mostly
a
grainy
type
flavor
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
a
bit
of
maltyness
as
well
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
its
light
and
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
cheap
goto
beer
but
not
bad
the
taste
is
sweet
and
the
feel
is
rather
creamy
small
bitter
hop
notes
but
mostly
sweet
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
the
best
beer
or
even
top
25
beer
but
for
your
dollar
i
wouldnt
put
much
ahead
of
this
a
12
pack
for
10
bucks

but
its
not
totally
apealing
it
has
a
wet
noodle
sort
of
taste
that
is
just
off
the
mark
for
me
without
really
being
able
to
be
much
more
specific
the
mouthfeel
is
my
biggest
issue
though
it
is
way
way
over
carbonated
which
makes
it
a
tough
session
beer
even
though
it
would
otherwise
meet
that
criteria
its
just
too
fizzy
to
really
enjoy
and
inexpensive
theres
nothing

yuengling
lager
despite
the
score
disparity
i
like
this
even
more
than
natty
boh
a
hefty
cut
about
bmc
as
far
as
lighter
easy
access
beers
nothing
special
but
the
heavyweight
in
its
weight
class
serving
type
bottle
solid
session
beer
old
reliable
overall
pretty
good
beer
and
easy
everday
beer
i
like
this
beer
especially
towards
a
warm
summer
day
when
youre
on
the
grill
cooking
and
need
one
while
flipping
steaks
drink
with
pride
salud
im
a
bit
biased
for
this
beer
as
it
was
probably
the
first
beer
i
ever
actually
liked
its
a
good
go
to
simple
beer
gets
the
job
done
sometimes
i
just
get
a
craving
for
this
beer
and
its
a
reliable
choice
when
the
draft
selection
isnt
that
great
as
you
find
pretty
much
find
this
beer
anywhere
ill
always
have
a
special
place
for
the
old
traditional
well
its
yuengling
so
its
obviously
nothing
special
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
very
sessionable
and
at
18
a
case
its
a
good
bang
for
your
buck
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
surely
thirstquenching
the
body
is
light
enough
to
assist
the
drinker
in
avoiding
the
full
effects
of
the
flavors
of
this
beer
the
carbonation
is
very
prickly
which
really
helps
to
make
this
beer
a
gulper
this
beer
will
always
remind
of
north
carolina
where
my
friends
introduced
it
to
me
on
spring
break
since
it
was
the
only
palatable
beer
at
the
local
piggly
wiggly
for
the
price
its
hard
to
touch
the
smell
and
flavor
that
this
beer
offers
i
think
i
always
used
to
drink
it
out
of
the
bottle
so
i
never
noted
the
lackluster
appearance
before
a
simple
easy
drinking
beer
that
puts
the
big
three
and
practically
all
other
macros
to
shame
a
local
standard
paying
respect
to
americas
oldest
brewery
almost
weekly
overall
a
great
session
lager
easy
on
the
palate
ladies
and
guys
who
like
their
beers
on
the
lighter
smoother
side
would
appreciate
americas
oldest
brewerys
flagship
beer
surprisingly
good
for
what
youd
think
would
just
be
another
macro
it
is
a
macro
but
it
shows
what
they
could
do
in
the
macro
space
if
they
wanted
to
its
not
trying
to
be
craft
just
a
solid
no
frills
lager
its
a
respectable
tasty
and
perfectly
good
session
beer
overall
an
above
average
lager
would
drink
again
poured
on
tap
to
a
clear
amber
color
some
offwhite
head
some
lacing
smelled
roasted
malts
biscuity
a
tad
yeasty
not
much
taste
is
good
moderate
biscuitmalty
flavour
a
little
yeast
taste
some
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
moderate
body
with
some
carbonation
overall
a
solid
beer
i
enjoy
it
when
im
looking
for
something
decent
for
a
good
price
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
price
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
out
there
overall
decent
beer
but
would
benefit
from
higher
quality
ingredients
beats
the
big
brands
but
still
i
prefer
other
regional
beers
i
bought
a
12pack
of
this
when
i
was
in
ny
two
years
ago
i
somehow
lost
track
of
this
one
bottle
that
i
reviewed
if
the
flavor
changed
over
time
it
got
better
seriously
this
holds
up
regardless
this
is
not
an
amazing
beer
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
its
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
price
overall
right
now
i
live
in
missouri
and
this
is
like
the
forbidden
fruit
for
most
of
the
guys
i
work
with
anytime
someone
goes
east
the
pick
up
a
case
of
this
for
the
next
function
o
yuengling
is
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
but
other
than
that
does
not
really
stand
out
in
any
one
category
it
hints
at
some
hoppiness
but
otherwise
not
too
interesting
usually
a
decent
choice
if
you
want
a
more
straightforward
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
much
better
than
the
bmcs
thats
for
sure
this
is
a
beer
that
can
be
had
alone
with
a
meal
with
soft
cheese
etc
it
is
very
versatile
again
probably
because
it
is
not
very
strong
and
the
flavors
are
kind
of
generic
this
is
a
good
quality
though
not
a
bad
one
if
you
are
used
to
big
beers
or
ipas
etc
you
will
find
this
one
on
the
weaker
side
a
nice
break
from
my
normal
routine
of
belgians
and
ipas
cheers
to
beers
although
detractors
might
say
its
no
more
than
a
step
above
your
basic
macro
where
im
from
its
special
the
true
magic
of
this
beer
is
its
ability
to
accompany
anything
its
great
with
your
staples
like
pizza
and
wings
but
it
also
excels
with
chinese
and
thai
a
steak
barbecue
or
anything
you
can
throw
at
it
everybody
who
lives
east
should
know
it
west
you
should
seek
it
out
and
taste
an
american
legend
overall
a
respectable
american
lager
but
nothing
overly
exceptional
i
took
notes
on
my
phone

im

with

overall
amazing
for
the
cheap
price
my
beer
of
choice
if
i
want
to
get
drunk
on
something
a
bit
lighter
but
tasty
many
say
this
is
there
favorite
macro
brewed
beer
and
i
dont
blame
them
yeungling
has
made
a

name
for
itself

looking

crisp
feel
noticed
off
the
bat
citrusy
notes
sweet
maltiness
and
hops
to
round
it
out
very
well
balanced
not
complex
i
like
this
beer
it
is
brewed
with
more
integrity
than
beers
like
bud
while
still
being
really
cheap
glad
to
have
it
available
here
in
jersey
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
better
than
most
available
macros
but
never
to
be
confused
for
a
pure
craft
beer
its
clearly
dominated
by
adjuncts
but
it
has
enough
malt
to
push
it
into
not
bad
territory
worth
picking
up
if
short
on
funds

for

fizzy
a

that
dissolved
in

smells

expect

there
is
a

comes

not
quite
by

this

is

i

its

theres
also
not

overall
as
hyped
as
this
beer
was
expanding
west
and
never
having
had
it
before
i
was
slightly
disappointed
still
this
a
good
alternative
to
drinking
the
macros
because
of
the
superior
flavor
and
comparable
price
i
look
for
this
to
replace
the
macros
in
the
new
ohio
markets
o
yuengling
was
a
beer
to
look
forward
to
when
heading
to
the
east
coast
now
that
we
get
it
in
ohio
its
great
addition
its
all
ive
been
buying
however
its
also
not
quite
as
good
as
you
think
it
was
when
only
drinking
it
on
occasion
o
not
the
incredible
lager
it
is
advertised
as
but
its
much
better
than
the
your
average
aal
id
much
rather
people
be
drinking
this
than
bmc
it
at
least
has
a
little
character
overall
my
go
to
picnic
beer
or
everyday
value
beer
i
am
a
self
admitted
beer
snob
i
have
not
had
a
macro
beer
in
almost
4
years
this
does
not
make
me
want
to
go
back
although
its
not
necessarily
horrible
if
you
were
going
to
have
some
beer
laying
around
for
friends
and
social
gatherings
this
is
a
choice
for
you
o
yuenging
is
new
to
ohio
and
i
first
had
it
ontap
tonight
was
a
6pack
bottle
overall
its
a
very
crisp
clean
and
drinkable
beer
with
more
flavor
than
other
mass
produced
beers
its
not
super
hoppy
or
malty
like
other
lagers
just
right
imo
o
this
was
my
first
interaction
with
yuengling
and
i
know
now
what
all
the
hype
is
about
this
beer
really
is
good
and
i
would
prefer
this
over
other
mass
produced
lagers
but
this
doesnt
make
it
to
ca
ever
smooth
and
refreshing
are
terms
that
come
to
mind
as
i
gulp
this
one
easy
drinker
here
nice
mellow
flavors
of
grains
light
bitter
bite
and
a
sweet
finish
this
beer
itches
me
where
i
scratch
time
and
again
whether
its
draft
can
or
bottle
this
is
a
beer
i
will
continue
to
revisit
simple
refreshing
tasty
o
a
great
session
beer
if
you
every
want
to
hang
out
and
have
a
casual
brew
its
a
hometown
favorite
so
ill
grab
one
whenever
im
out
at
a
dive
bar
with
a
poor
beer
selection
and
it
definitely
does
the
trick
knowing
the
type
of
beer
youre
ordering
youll
be
very
satisfied
with
your
choice
yep
drinkable
i
wish
this
was
sent
to
ct
because
it
would
be
my
replacement
for
pbr
and
i
would
have
a
friendly
alternative
beer
that
i
could
grab
when
i
go
to
peoples
parties
what
a
shame
overall
if
you
looking
for
a
session
beer
thats
a
bit
better
than
mcb
then
check
this
out
its
not
availible
in
the
west
yet
but
i
suspect
it
will
get
there
soon
enough
ok
not
bad
o
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
of
the
commercials
beers
it
is
good
but
not
great
by
any
means
but
i
would
take
this
over
a
bud
light
any
day
oi
do
not
have
any
desire
to
have
a
yuengling
on
tap
again
i
will
have
it
in
the
summer
to
quench
thirst
but
that
really
is
it
no
idea
why
everyone
is
so
gaga
over
this
beer
in
ohio
i
would
rather
have
a
bud
light
even
in
regard
to
style
this
beer
really
has
no
defining
qualities
to
separate
it
from
the
swill
besides
its
color
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
insanely
easy
to
session
through
the
entire
night
if
you
dont
necessarily
care
about
what
you
are
tasting
as
i
said
id
rather
encounter
this
brew
out
and
about
when
compared
to
many
of
its
rivals
still
the
beer
scores
fairly
low
in
its
category
i
was
more
impressed
with
yuenglings
black
and
tan
offering
dry
yet
a
bit
sweet
from
the
malt
its
ok
better
than
other
macros
i
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
small
cone
shaped
glass
the
head
was
about
a
finger
and
faded
fast
i
held
the
glass
up
to
the
light
to
reveal
a
nice
clear
amber
color
to
the
beer
the
aroma
had
a
nice
caramel
malt
smell
with
little
to
no
hint
of
hops
taste
was
smooth
with
the
malt
being
the
main
feature
nice
caramel
quality
fading
to
some
of
the
yeastybready
character
mouth
feel
is
full
with
the
generous
but
not
overly
done
carbonation
ive
had
a
few
mass
produced
lagers
like
budweiser
and
michelob
and
this
beer
tops
even
the
michelob
its
not
exactly
a
craft
beer
nor
an
uber
mass
produced
one
like
budweiser
its
just
a
good
solid
lager
corrections
and
feedback
are
wanted
thanks
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
1
head
not
much
aroma
here
mild
biscuit
and
caramel
aroma
tastes
like
a
clean
lager
not
sure
why
yuengling
gets
a
bad
wrap
id
much
rather
have
one
of
these
over
your
standard
bmc
product
o
better
than
most
american
lagers
yet
clearly
in
that
simple
easy
to
drink
style
i
enjoyed
it
just
as
much
out
of
the
can
as
pouring
it
into
a
glass
o
ive
never
really
understood
the
appeal
of
yuengling
i
have
friends
who
think
that
it
is
the
best
beer
ever
made
to
me
its
a
very
mediocre
very
white
bread
beer
if
it
gets
you
away
from
macros
it
is
doing
its
job
but
please
dont
stop
here
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
reasonably
priced
and
readily
available
lager
this
is
a
benchmark
session
beer
in
my
opinion
for
some
reason
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
in
a
bottle
as
i
think
yuengling
tastes
much
better
from
the
tap
several
14
kegs
of
yuengling
will
make
its
way
to
my
kegerator
throughout
the
year
when
i
need
to
keep
a
good
session
beer
on
hand
like
many
have
already
mentioned
part
of
the
allure
of
this
beer
is
its
history
and
relevance
to
the
region
honestly
there
was
always
something
unique
about
being
able
to
just
ask
for
a
lager
and
be
handed
a
yuengling
the
best
thing
is
around
here
you
can
just
order
a
lager
and
they
bring
you
a
yuengling
no
better
lager
overall
honestly
its
like
drinking
seltzer
water
with
some
malt
infused
its
unoffensive
and
drinkable
but
bland
as
anything
o
this
is
an
old
standby
around
here
its
a
step
above
any
of
the
big
three
companies
with
a
great
price
and
great
drinkability
it
wont
turn
any
heads
but
im
always
happy
that
this
is
always
on
tap
at
bars
around
here
at
a
great
price
i
mean
really
a
12
pack
for
11
thank
you
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
easy
drinking
could
drink
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
yep
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
beer
for
those
times
when
i
dont
feel
like
spending
a
lot
of
money
and
i
dont
foresee
anything
changing
that
cheers
a
solid
no
frills
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
without
thinking
about
it
not
bad
at
all
i
used
to
drink
this
beer
in
western
pa
where
i
grew
up
i
moved
away
nine
years
ago
and
now
live
in
south
louisiana
this
beer
is
not
available
here
and
only
get
it
when
i
travel
to
see
family
in
florida
or
go
to
the
beach
in
alabama
far
too
many
people
on
here
miss
the
point
of
this
beer
yuengling
is
not
meant
to
be
compared
to
micro
brew
or
specialty
beers
when
compared
to
mass
brewed
beers
by
coors
budwiesermilleror
any
other
large
produced
beer
it
more
than
holds
its
own
i
have
not
met
anyone
down
here
that
doesnt
love
this
beer
i
would
use
coors
light
or
budbud
light
to
wash
the
floors
at
the
yuengling
brewery
this
is
an
every
day
workingmans
beer
kind
of
like
that
dependable
truck
you
drive
to
work
every
day
the
high
priced
beers
that
i
also
loveare
like
that
nice
convertible
you
only
take
out
on
sunny
weekends
love
this
beer
bring
it
to
louisiana
poured
from
the
can
into
a
plastic
cup
it
looks
like
a
reddish
orange
color
from
the
top
what
little
head
there
was
didnt
last
long
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
bread
taste
is
similiar
to
the
nose
with
a
surprise
thrown
in
there
hops
theres
a
little
bite
to
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easy
with
good
carbonation
and
a
mediun
light
body
to
it
overall
this
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
anytime
of
year
but
especially
this
time
of
year
with
a
bowl
of
chili
o
yuengling
is
just
an
easy
drinking
reasnonably
good
tasting
lager
not
a
bad
choice
overall
to
be
fair
i
did
have
an
old
rasputin
a
few
minutes
before
so
that
may
have
an
effect
on
my
judging
of
this
beer
but
that
said
this
beer
was
just
ok
kinda
bland
didnt
really
wow
me
at
all
not
sure
why
yuengling
beers
get
all
this
hype
i
mean
their
ok
and
the
price
is
low
but
meh
12oz
green
bottle
pours
a
amberred
body
with
little
head
slightly
roasty
caramel
malt
comprises
the
aroma
bready
sweet
caramel
comprises
the
flavor
just
the
slightest
hop
presence
to
speak
of
medium
to
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
fairly
simple
and
light
serves
its
purpose
pleasant
and
drinkable
without
challenging
the
palate
too
much
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
seeing
as
though
its
not
distributed
in
new
england
average
in
just
about
every
way
for
me
i
cant
quite
appreciate
the
fanatic
devotion
many
have
for
this
beer
but
then
again
i
wasnt
rooting
for
the
iggles
either
offers
a
lightly
creamy
flavor
with
a
light
but
present
maltiness
and
finishes
with
a
touch
of
citrus
hop
feel
matches
the
general
delivery
of
the
beer
smooth
and
lightly
malty
for
the
style
and
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
overall
a
light
take
on
the
amber
lager
style
in
color
and
flavor
alike
as
a
result
there
isnt
a
great
deal
of
depth
to
the
pour
yet
it
does
fairly
well
for
what
it
is
and
is
easy
drinking
as
a
result
and
never
cloying
by
any
means
you
smell
a
ton
of
the
noble
hop
off
the
top
it
tastes
the
same
it
was
a
very
typical
lager
flavored
but
the
flavors
are
much
stronger
than
the
bmc
it
is
a
step
up
from
bud
and
maybe
it
can
be
used
as
a
gateway
beer
for
bmcs
to
move
on
to
craft
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
at
this
point
o
i
never
understood
why
people
drove
out
of
state
to
get
this
beer
with
all
great
beers
available
in
ohio
it
is
a
great
value
for
the
price
though
it
is
a
beer
that
you
would
say
tastes
like
beer
yuengling
is
my
favorite
regular
beer
it
may
be
because
the
only
time
i
get
it
regularly
is
when
i
am
on
vacation
either
way
it
is
better
than
most
mass
produced
lagers
as
it
at
least
has
some
tast
to
it
this
is
my
go
to
lawnmower
beer
this
is
another
beer
that
i
find
great
to
drink
while
watching
football
or
any
other
sporting
event
it
is
cheap
in
price
and
good
in
taste
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
quite
easy
to
drink
more
than
intended
as
they
start
going
down
pretty
smooth
good
beer
at
a
great
price
i
just
wish
they
were
able
to
distribute
closer
to
home
this
was
my
good
beer
in
college
and
now
it
is
available
everywhere
in
nyc
a
very
easydrinking
amber
lager
with
a
nice
flavor
light
mouthfeel
and
a
very
clean
finish
this
beer
is
a
solid
midshelf
beer
that
is
a
staple
of
steeler
games
pours
a
clear
filtered
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
like
many
lagers
this
doesnt
retain
much
of
a
head
at
all
or
leave
any
lacing
it
looks
sort
of
boring
but
that
may
be
the
style
really
sweet
malts
caramel
and
grains
come
through
in
the
aroma
taste
is
similar
with
an
overall
sweetness
to
it
very
easy
drinking
cheap
and
always
available
when
youre
in
a
pinch
you
can
count
on
yuengling
to
be
there
to
pull
you
out
o
a
fairly
nice
beer
was
shocked
to
find
this
at
a
golf
course
of
all
places
as
i
didnt
think
the
brewery
even
distributed
to
ma
was
worth
the
3
75
i
paid
for
the
16
ounce
can
a
basic
but
tasty
lager
and
definitely
a
cut
above
the
bmc
offerings
a
goto
beer
when
im
at
a
nonbeer
bar
or
restaurant
overall
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
on
the
way
down
to
pitt
in
june
this
is
the
last
of
my
bottles
and
would
drink
it
again
if
possible
whether
bottle
or
draft
never
again
o
why
why
why
do
idiots
insist
on
sacrificing
a
beers
integrity
for
look
of
packaging
at
any
rate
this
is
a
very
plain
beer
further
marred
by
lightstruck
skunkiness
issues
for
which
i
have
no
compassion
o
its
a
good
gettogether
beer
that
in
my
opinion
beats
most
of
the
macro
offerings
in
pretty
much
each
category
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
varying
in
size
with
the
pour
with
not
much
to
speak
of
in
regards
to
retention
or
lacing
grainy
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
malts
bready
taste
caramel
malts
easygoing
floral
hops
can
be
a
bit
metallic
varying
depending
on
freshness
and
the
source
from
whence
you
acquired
it
light
bodied
and
fairly
drinkable
but
only
if
theres
nothing
else
available
not
including
the
typical
macros
pretty
light
from
beginning
to
end
overall
drinkability
better
on
draft
than
bottle
maybe
my
opinion
on
that
flipped
a
couple
times
before
i
finished
in
style
its
good
beats
bmc
at
least
i
guess
not
sure
what
the
hype
is
about
it
though
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
impressive
heft
for
a
lager
prickly
carbonation
that
wakes
up
the
taste
buds
enjoyable
i
see
why
this
beer
has
such
a
following
cheers
d
a
midatlantic
staple
however
when
dissecting
the
flavor
some
flaws
are
evident
like
i
said
above
maybe
its
the
can
maybe
i
just
have
a
softspot
for
yuengling
lager
but
this
is
always
a
moderately
priced
goto
where
im
from
overall
not
bad
at
all
of
course
its
too
bland
and
boring
but
it
isnt
nasty
and
that
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
most
massproduced
american
lagers
this
is
a
beer
that
has
a
bit
of
history
and
it
doesnt
disgrace
that
history
a
solid
lager
from
classic
american
brewery
o
a
step
up
in
every
way
from
bmc
beers
but
nothing
special
just
a
solid
drinkable
beer
pretty
cheap
and
its
restriction
the
the
east
coast
makes
it
feel
somehow
exclusive
as
i
mentioned
this
has
been
my
family
beer
forever
so
it
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
and
my
palate
i
might
be
biased
because
of
how
close
i
am
to
the
brewery
but
this
is
essentially
a
staple
in
my
area
if
youre
out
at
any
bar
without
a
craft
beer
selection
you
can
always
count
on
yuengling
being
available
a
beer
id
gladly
take
any
day
o
this
is
the
best
golf
beer
ever
in
my
opinion
it
goes
down
super
easy
and
its
an
old
style
beer
no
frills
nothing
fancy
i
actually
happen
to
love
this
beer
but
as
far
as
how
it
stacks
up
to
other
brews
and
the
overall
craft
its
nothing
out
of
this
world
its
one
of
those
notsogreat
beers
that
i
cant
get
enough
of
d
not
very
much
flavor
but
it
sure
goes
down
pretty
easy
crisp
and
refreshing
it
is
what
it
is
serving
type
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
wide
mouthed
glass
overall
a
decent
brew
if
i
had
to
go
cheap
this
would
be
it
easy
drinking
beer
that
goes
great
with
those
hot
days
and
the
post
lawn
mowing
thing
unfortunately
this
beer
is
not
availble
here
in
the
northeast
for
what
ever
reason
big
thanks
to
mr
apac
for
this
fine
12
pack
o
not
something
i
feel
the
need
to
try
again
but
i
am
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
all
in
all
better
than
most
basic
lagers
of
his
style
12
79
for
a
12pak
cans
if
i
was
getting
these
for
free
i
would
enjoy
them
however
i
would
not
pay
more
than
10
for
a
twelve
pack
of
these
othe
best
macro
out
there
and
at
a
great
price
maybe
the
best
macro
lager
i
ordered
this
on
tap
at
a
restaurant
so
i
had
no
control
over
the
pour
but
there
was
no
head
at
all
color
was
amber
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
at
all
the
smell
was
unimpressive
a
vague
malty
smell
with
a
slight
skunkiness
my
wife
was
complaining
about
the
smell
from
across
the
table
taste
was
nothing
special
but
not
offensive
a
grainy
flavor
mostly
nothing
complex
thin
and
uninspiring
mouthfeel
better
than
most
mainstream
lagers
but
id
not
get
it
again
i
grew
up
on
this
stuff
30
years
ago
before
it
was
cool
to
like
it
on
par
with
gibbons
reading
etc
a
local
brew
that
went
mainstream
in
nc
with
great
publicity
a
little
wierd
funky
flavor
a
little
too
oaky
which
i
dont
like
with
a
lighter
lager
style
better
than
the
big
3
but
not
as
drinkable
as
pbr
or
schlitz
not
even
a
really
great
outdoors
style
beer
in
the
heat
where
brew
in
this
catagory
shine
call
it
what
they
will
but
its
still
an
aal
overall
i
would
buy
again
without
a
doubt
great
thirst
quenching
lager
overall
pretty
good
overall
i
think
i
actually
prefer
premium
to
traditional
but
this
is
still
pretty
nice
definitely
a
cut
above
its
macro
contenders
d
superb
drinkability
this
is
my
go
to
session
beer
as
its
extremely
affordable
in
large
quantities
and
has
good
flavor
overall
its
an
above
average
lager
that
beats
most
of
the
macro
brews
easily
taste
wise
its
widespread
availability
at
least
in
the
eastern
u
s
is
also
a
huge
plus
i
purchased
a
12
pack
of
these
while
they
were
on
sale
and
im
hooked
brew
has
a
nice
amber
color
and
a
smooth
taste
this
brew
reminds
me
of
a
craft
style
beer
plus
its
less
expensive
usually
a
12
pack
is
under
10
for
the
money
this
is
the
best
amber
lager
on
the
market
my
go
to
brew
overall
i
good
lager
choice
for
the
price
otherwise
quite
boring
to
me
and
i
dont
like
the
dry
finish
it
leaves
on
the
pallet
still
a
good
option
if
bmc
is
other
options
yuengling
lager
is
a
slight
step
up
from
bmc
products
the
beer
actually
pours
slightly
darker
than
expected
w
little
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
that
of
malt
and
some
slight
hops
theres
a
skunky
smell
in
there
as
well
the
taste
profile
is
the
same
as
the
nose
not
very
good
not
complex
at
all
not
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
very
one
dimensional
and
has
no
redeeming
qualities
overall
i
would
not
voluntarily
drink
this
brew
not
recommended
so
im
in
a
restaurant
in
western
pa
and
my
choices
are
bud
miller
coors
or
yuengling
my
decision
made
itself
pours
a
deepreddish
amber
color
with
a
thinnish
white
head
surprisingly
dark
color
for
a
macro
earthy
grainy
aroma
with
hints
of
corn
and
skunk
slight
earthy
hop
aroma
was
a
surprise
taste
is
earthy
with
hops
grainy
with
malts
and
slighly
corny
medium
to
high
level
of
carbonation
light
body
with
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
better
than
the
macros
but
nothing
special
on
its
own
not
a
great
beer
but
better
than
any
bmc
massproduced
lager
easily
drinkable
and
cheap
its
my
go
to
tailgate
beer
o
this
beer
is
usually
no
more
than
10
for
a
12
pack
and
it
is
just
downright
awesome
i
love
this
and
it
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
though
i
am
sure
i
am
giving
a
bit
of
a
hometown
advantage
i
urge
you
all
to
try
it
no
way
youll
be
sorry
o
a
decent
representation
of
what
an
amercian
lager
should
be
i
first
had
this
beer
sitting
in
a
bar
across
from
fenway
park
the
first
time
i
was
ever
there
o
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
really
stands
out
in
it
id
much
rather
drink
one
of
these
than
most
bmc
beers
but
its
nothing
special
have
had
it
many
times
and
im
sure
i
will
again
a
good
alternative
to
bmc
beers
at
most
bars
on
the
east
coast
i
am
drinking
this
beer
right
after
a
high
life
and
the
distinctions
between
the
two
are
clear
i
have
become
a
fan
of
yuengling
as
it
is
a
much
richer
more
complex
lager
than
any
of
the
american
adjuncts
the
high
life
almost
tastes
like
water
compared
to
this
beer
i
prefer
sam
adams
boston
lager
over
this
beer
but
i
cant
think
of
many
other
lagers
that
i
have
had
that
top
it
for
the
price
i
think
it
deserves
a
good
rating
for
its
unique
qualities
and
original
taste
its
a
real
good
lager
hey
say
what
you
will
for
the
price
this
aint
bad
went
down
good
and
just
enough
flavor
to
make
it
interesting
nothing
to
write
your
friends
about
but
really
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
o
a
traditional
lager
but
much
better
than
your
usual
adjunct
lager
im
still
trying
to
figure
out
why
its
categorized
as
an
amberred
lager
light
in
color
golden
amber
i
would
say
with
little
to
no
head
smells
pretty
bad
to
be
honest
just
like
most
lagers
i
can
taste
corn
and
maybe
some
hints
of
nuts
in
the
brew
pretty
metallic
flavored
and
not
much
else
going
on
but
its
definitely
better
than
most
of
the
mainstream
lagers
i
only
drink
this
when
there
is
nothing
better
at
hand
drinkable
but
id
rather
have
something
else
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
then
bud
here
its
a
little
maltier
version
of
budweiser
what
this
beer
lacks
in
style
it
makes
for
in
substance
lager
is
a
great
go
to
beer
to
have
on
hand
tasty
drinkable
and
pure
pennsylvania
e
very
now
and
then
the
lager
craving
hits
and
i
just
have
to
have
it
this
is
an
ok
unpretentious
offering
decent
for
the
price
nothing
great
but
nothing
horrible
m
the
carbonation
is
high
and
it
goes
down
smooth
feels
lagery
o
i
like
yuengling
lager
pretty
well
and
is
my
beer
of
choice
when
at
an
establishment
with
no
craft
options
it
also
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
putting
out
the
fire
that
is
princes
hot
chicken
moreys
bottom
line
a
beer
that
my
money
wont
be
spent
on
unless
im
purchasing
it
for
someone
else
not
a
bad
summer
beer
though
o
i
usually
dont
like
lagers
all
that
much
but
this
is
actually
a
good
example
of
an
amber
lager
it
has
some
nice
flavors
aside
from
watered
down
beer
or
lager
yeast
and
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
o
i
love
the
story
behind
this
beer
seriously
americas
oldest
brewery
how
can
you
not
like
that
but
the
quality
of
the
brew
just
doesnt
cut
it
though
this
seems
to
be
in
the
big
brewery
style
i
would
certainly
drink
this
over
a
bmc
any
day
i
know
thats
not
saying
much
but
its
all
i
can
really
say
for
this
one
its
a
pretty
average
beer
o
because
of
the
pa
ties
and
the
sentimental
value
this
one
has
it
gets
the
score
it
does
for
this
category
the
go
to
beer
in
pa
and
in
my
household
o
overall
not
a
good
beer
by
any
means
however
it
is
refreshing
and
is
better
than
anything
by
bmc
overall
its
an
okay
beer
its
not
my
favorite
but
it
isnt
bad
personally
i
would
give
it
a
lower
rating
but
because
of
the
quality
it
presents
for
being
the
price
it
is
its
not
a
bad
beer
when
it
comes
to
macro
lagers
i
prefer
coors
light
or
coors
pabst
blue
ribbon
and
then
natural
ice
in
that
order
im
not
opposed
to
darker
beers
at
all
in
fact
i
prefer
mostly
dark
beers
however
im
just
not
a
real
big
fan
of
yuengling
original
lager
anymore
i
used
to
be
but
for
whatever
reason
things
have
changed
cheers
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
bitter
at
the
end
this
ones
a
thirst
quencher
but
really
can
make
do
for
any
occasion
if
im
stuck
for
choices
i
can
fall
back
on
this
one
with
no
question
here
in
pa
this
one
defines
lager
seriously
you
can
walk
into
any
beer
say
lager
it
is
economical
w
flavor
vandejul

other
times
more
malt
but
here
i
am
giving
it
a
decent
grade
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
still
easy
to
drink
overall
but
at
the
same
price
point
as
a
budcoorsmiller
but
thats
simply
because
i
am
not
drinking
one
right
now
and
i
cant
recall
exactly
the
smell
so
this
review
is
subject
to
change
once
i
have
another
while
i
wont
go
crazy
over
it

its
a
solid
american
red
lager
nothing
fancy
nothing
bad
the
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
has
some
lace
the
nose
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
smell
like
a
plain
american
amber
ale
the
taste
is
very
solid
a
very
drinkable
beer
there
is
grain
and
malt
that
can
be
found
on
the
pallete
the
mouthfeel
is
easy
and
could
session
all
day
long
anyway
drink
yuengling
its
good
affordable
and
deserves
to
be
help
more
prominently
than
the
big
three
that
dominate
the
world
of
featherweight
beer
overall
its
a
fantastic
beer
to
pick
up
when
youve
got
a
bunch
of
friends
coming
over
or
just
to
have
in
the
fridge
as
a
backup
i
pity
those
of
you
outside
the
distribution
area
o
you
know
what
you
are
getting
with
this
beer
it
has
a
purpose
and
fills
it
well
it
is
an
inexpensive
session
beer
that
is
superior
to
bmc
products
good
for
a
long
day
hanging
outside
at
a
bbq
or
at
the
beach
overall
it
is
what
it
is
and
its
damn
good
for
what
it
is
the
pour
is
light
to
amber
color
with
an
acceptable
head
not
paticularly
fragrant
but
thats
ok
with
me
i
enjoyed
the
taste
not
to
hoppy
or
filling
for
a
multiple
dose
everyday
beer
minimal

mow
refresher
choice
o
soso
beer
with
some
major
weaknesses
when
compared
to
the
better
examples
of
the
style
still
its
light
and
easy
enough
to
drink
with
a
serviceable
flavor
that
would
make
it
sessionworthy
i
spose
should
you
choose
to
go
the
route
of
fairly
bland
and
macroish
lagers
i
picked
up
a
24oz
can
at
a
gas
station
in
florida
for
1
99
it
was
right
next
to
the
bmc
40s
it
pours
a
watery
and
crystal
clear
orangeish
amber
in
color
with
a
billowing
two
finger
soft
and
spongy
off
white
head
it
smells
of
sweet
carmel
malts
bread
crumbs
and
has
that
bmc
aluminum
can
smell
it
actually
tastes
pretty
sweet
it
has
this
sweet
maltyness
which
isnt
too
shabby
and
it
is
sweeter
out
of
the
can
than
from
the
bottle
im
actually
surprised
at
how
much
better
this
one
tastes
out
of
the
can
there
is
zero
hop
presence
but
i
didnt
expect
any
its
a
little
watery
but
its
actually
pretty
drinkable
and
id
much
rather
drink
this
than
anything
else
with
the
same
price
tag
o
an
easy
going
easy
to
drink
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
stand
on
its
own
but
not
bold
enough
to
distract
from
a
meal
thanks
again
woody
for
hooking
it
up
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
since
before
uncle
sam
thinks
it
appropriate
before
ever
stepping
foot
in
the
beer
store
i
had
assumed
that
people
were
paying
510
per
case
for
this
beer
than
others
even
to
an
untrained
pallet
this
beer
had
special
characteristics
that
the
other
lagers
didnt
this
is
a
good
session
beer
for
a
damn
cheap
price
in
pa
its
only
20
and
some
change
for
24
bottles
great
beer
to
support
if
you
cant
afford
cases
of
beer
upwards
of
35
i
recommend
it
if
you
can
get
it
dont
see
why
anyone
would
drink
bud
or
miller
over
it
good
feel
here
this
is
a
decent
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
not
a
fan
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
just
seems
to
have
off
flavors
and
aromas
pours
to
a
1inch
white
head
and
ambergold
color
aroma
is
grassy
hops
and
sweet
malt
and
maybe
some
other
grains
it
has
a
whiff
of
white
grape
juice
flavor
is
crisp
and
balanced
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
butteriness
mixed
into
the
malty
grainy
backbone
mouthfeel
is
just
right
with
light
body
and
moderate
co2
overall
i
like
this
beer
for
everyday
that
is
if
they
started
distributing
to
my
area
i
had
to
go
to
the
memphis
airport
to
have
this
that
is
about
as
far
west
as
this
stuff
goes
nothing
extreme
balanced
no
weird
flavors
or
no
weird
flavors
i
dislike
a
solid
citizen
overall
i
guess
this
is
just
your
average
amber
nothing
too
impressive
here
other
than
the
fact
that
its
pretty
balanced
and
thats
pretty
affordable
i
would
still
drink
it
over
most
other
affordable
brews
whenever
im
out
and
the
bar
doesnt
have
what
i
want
this
beer
usually
comes
into
play
this
is
always
a
beer
that
i
can
fall
back
on
most
of
the
time
this
lager
pours
out
as
a
reddish
brown
color
not
typical
of
most
lagers
out
there
the
head
fades
very
fast
on
this
beer
unfortunately
the
smell
of
this
beer
kind
of
stands
on
it
own
the
mix
of
malts
some
possible
wood
aromas
come
through
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
on
this
beer
but
its
still
drinkable
would
that
other
bigname
us
lagers
taste
as
good
as
this
a
beer
i
would
certainly
be
happy
having
around
the
fridge
for
casual
patio
and
backyard
drinking
certainly
a
few
cuts
above
your
standard
bmc
fare
thats
for
damned
sure
my
local
beer
being
a
philadelphian
i
have
spent
many
a
night
drinking
mr
yuenglings
brew
i
really
feel
that
there
are
very
few
beers
that
have
the
great
appearance
that
lager

medium
bodied
beer
that
can
be
as
others
have
said
kind
of
watery
altogether
its
a
wonderful
beer
at
a
very
reasonable
price
here
picked
up
a
case
for
under
20
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
caramelcopper
coloring
with
a
thin
big
bubbled
white
head
toasted
malt
and
oats
in
the
aroma
the
beer
has
a
nuttytoffeesweet
malt
taste
with
roasted
flavors
into
the
aftertaste
the
beer
is
light
and
creamy
in
mouth
and
it
carries
the
flavor
well
the
finish
is
quick
to
the
roasted
sweet
flavors
but
blends
out
to
nothing
rapidly
its
an
easy
drinker
with
strong
flavors
for
the
style
this
is
pretty
easy
beer
for
drinking
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
but
the
wetness
of
it
real
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
at
least
this
is
drinkable
i
will
give
it
that
has
a
lightbodied
mouthfeel
and
is
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
a
bmc
and
costs
the
same
as
bud
light
where
i
live
so
it
is
decently
cheap
too
a
decent
simple
beer
would
probably
be
better
ontap
earlier
today
i
enjoyed
another
amber
lager

5
comparing
these
two
beers
doesnt
feel
right
this
yuengling
pours
a
transparent
tanamber
hue
with
a
12
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
nothing
smell
was
of
sweet
malt
and
grain
but
it
was
very
light
taste
was
only
slightly
more
impressive
starts
with
a
light
and
sweet
malt
then
you
get
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
the
slight
hops
moughfeel
is
pretty
light
overall
relatively
unimpressive
as
an
amber
lager
if
i
lived
in
its
distribution
area
id
keep
some
on
hand
to
give
my
bmc
friends
as
it
would
be
a
good
stepping
stone
pours
with
a
goodsize
head
that
slowly
dissipates
sporadic
lacing
remains
as
the
lager
is
drunk
the
primary
aroma
seems
to
be
toasted
grains
a
faint
sweetness
is
also
present
a
grainy
earthy
profile
is
also
present
upon
tasting
in
addition
i
detect
bitter
tea
and
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
theres
a
reason
yuengling
is
much
sought
after
by
people
outside
its
distribution
area
and
a
reason
its
my
lager
of
choicethis
stuff
is
extremely
drinkable
and
tastes
great
and
its
affordable
d
it
is
what
it
is
one
of
the
light
beers
but
disguised
with
a
deeper
color
i
could
easily
drink
4
or
5
or
6
whatever
well
see
where
the
night
takes
me
the
cpj
d
not
a
whole
lot
of
greatness
happening
here
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
but
would
i
want
to
drink
this
over
and
over
no
poured
from
the
can
the
orangeamber
color
and
modest
creamy
head
are
pleasant
enough
the
aroma
is
less
impressive
with
only
a
thin
malt
sweetness
coming
through
the
flavor
is
more
pronounced
with
a
bready
sweet
light
caramel
maltiness
that
is
contrasted
by
a
subtle
grassy
hop
character
the
body
is
thin
even
against
the
light
flavors
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
prickly
overall
this
is
not
a
world
class
beer
by
most
standards
but
i
prefer
it
over
a
majority
of
the
american
macro
lagers
out
there
today
d
easy
to
handle
in
large
quantities
pours
a
pale
amber
with
light
head
fading
quickly
very
mild
aroma
releases
grassy
hops
and
a
slightly
malty
carbonation
smooth
and
enjoyable
for
a
low
calorie
brew
at
128
cals12oz
its
flavor
underwhelms
however
as
the
very
sacrifices
that
keep
it
low
in
calories
have
impacted
the
richness
and
complexity
of
the
malts
i
look
at
it
as
a
slightly
more
flavorful
miller
lite
or
similar
mass
commercial
brew
but
probably
not
worth
the
22
additional
calories
poured
fine
decent
color
and
the
foam
was
dense
looking
but
as
it
decayed
it
was
strange
smelled
of
corn
and
soap
tasted
of
corn
and
soap
drinkable
brew
and
i
would
take
it
over
some
light
beers
but
this
doesnt
seem
to
me
as
decent
as
some
others
feel
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
as
being
sessionable
because
the
taste
isnt
interesting
enough
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
had
this
both
in
bottle
and
on
tap
on
tap
seems
to
be
my
favorite
nice
cold
mug
this
is
not
an
overbearing
tasting
beer
and
can
drink
alot
of
it
on
tap
without
the
full
feeling
most
beers
can
give
not
very
foamy
better
on
tap
then
the
bottle
if
your
going
to
drink
several
12oz
bottle
pours
a
translucent
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
with
some
malts
and
breadiness
some
caramel
aroma
as
well
flavor
doesnt
have
any
of
the
skunky
qualities
that
the
smell
did
nice
smooth
caramel
flavor
with
some
malt
what
it
lacks
in
the
mouthfeel
department
it
makes
up
for
in
the
drinkability
this
is
an
inexpensive
well
made
lager
that
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
worthy
of
having
a
surplus
of
it
in
the
beer
fridge
d
ill
buy
this
before
any
bmc
but
will
pass
it
up
for
a
moderately
priced
micro
or
craft
this
beer
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
very
drinkable
and
dependable
d
amazing
drinkability
hey
you
have
choice
this
is
a
cheap
beer
but
a
good
cheap
beer
it
doesnt
leave
you
gagging
after
3
beers
no
you
can
breeze
through
alot
of
these
damn
good
beer
regardless
this
is
a
wonderful
session
brew
for
a
large
american
brewery
and
a
domestic
lager
particularly
in
the
cold
longneck
bottle
on
a
warm
summer
day
straw
yellow
and
clear
with
average
head
that
disappears
quickly
light
malt
smell
fresh
and
clean
with
very
light
hop
must
very
light
malt
flavor
with
light
hop
bitterness
slightly
metallic
and
no
pine
cloy
at
all
high
carbonation
but
goes
down
fast
and
easy
solid
brew
that
you
could
enjoy
all
night
amber
pour
with
lively
carbonation
and
nice
sized
white
frothy
head
aroma
is
slightly
grainy
with
some
caramel
malt
and
grassy
hops
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
hop
bittering
flavors
are
not
overly
pronounced
and
graininess
is
a
bit
too
prevalent
but
this
brew
is
great
for
the
style
take
this
over
any
other
american
macroswill
any
day
a
great
dry
lager
with
flavor
and
zing
i
bet
an
ice
cold
bottle
of
this
is
even
better
good
stuff
you
could
do
worse
for
a
readily
available
beer
when
youre
not
feeling
adventurous
and
just
want
a
comfortable
familiar
flavor
and
feeling
lager
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
a
real
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
it
is
a
step
above
most
bmc
offerings
but
no
where
near
the
level
ive
become
accustomed
to
havent
had
a
yuengling
lager
in
a
loong
time
buddy
left
a
few
bwhind
after
a
card
game
last
night
and
figured
id
crack
into
one
reminds
me
of
my
days
as
a
college
student
in
pa
when
i
drank
many
a
pint
of
this
brew
nothing
special
but
an
easy
one
to
knock
back
thanks
to
my
lovely
wife
for
smuggling
some
of
this
back
from
a
trip
to
d
c
my
perfect
pour
glass
was
filled
with
a
light
coppercolor
beer
capped
with
a
fingers
of
bubble
foam
the
aroma
was
lightly
malted
with
some
yeast
not
much
there
the
flavor
was
much
better
than
others
of
the
style
ive
have
before
the
taste
is
the
aroma
plus
a
tiny
hint
of
citrus
the
body
is
good
and
it
goes
down
with
just
a
bit
of
twinge
on
the
tongue
overall
its
okay
for
the
style
but
doesnt
pack
the
punch
of
my
regular
beer
lineup
if
your
looking
for
an
easy
beer
to
enjoy
at
a
bbq
or
bowling
this
will
fit
the
bill
so
in
short
if
i
could
only
drink
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
you
can
put
money
on
yuengling
traditional
amber
lager
i
mean
for
crist
sate
yuengling
is
the
oldest
brewery
in
america
they
must
know
what
the
hell
they
are
doing
after
a
partial
can
of
clear
creek
ice
this
is
a
very
relieving
brew
to
drink
nicely
priced
too
d
the
abv
on
this
beer
is
lower
and
makes
it
perfect
for
drinker
many
of
this
beer
has
a
better
taste
than
most
adjunct
lagers
clean
and
crisp
tasting
this
beer
would
go
well
in
the
summer
after
mowing
the
lawn
yuengling
is
sort
of
a
goto
party
beer
because
its
easy
to
get
and
its
quite
cheap
and
its
an
easy
choice
in
bars
that
dont
have
much
selection
its
much
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
or
can
for
what
its
worth
a
pretty
standard
lager
but
pretty
tasty
as
well
a
nice
simple
session
beer
nothing
complex
but
not
bad

this
is
my
first
time
that
i
test
this
beer
and
for
me
it
taste
a
little
like
a
high
class
budweiser
at
the
endthe
head
last
longer
than
an
averege
lagerlove
the
color
is
dark
ambera
bit
of
hobmalty
flavor
and
a
far
sweetnes
at
the
end
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
when
it
gets
about
58
degrees
the
the
aroma
become
a
bit
more
intense
bit
the
flavor
still
the
same
not
like
the
some
lagers
that
become
undrinkable
drinkability
beer
is
easy
to
drink
for
anyone
but
in
st
louis
our
version
is
budweiser
while
being
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
for
the
first
time
since
they
dont
sell
in
missouri
i
was
let
down
being
the
oldest
brewery
in
america
i
expected
more
from
them
i
will
be
looking
for
more
of
their
beers
to
try
though
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
small
caramel
like
notes
and
somewhat
standard
lager
smells
in
the
taste
small
caramel
sweet
to
dry
an
abrasive
hop
bite
and
all
the
standard
lager
flavors
as
well
a
bitter
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
caramel
like
aftertaste
a
bit
abrasive
but
nice
caramel
like
notes
d
this
is
my
budwesier
exceptional
drinkablity
if
i
go
to
a
bar
and
yuengling
is
the
only
thing
on
tap
i
order
it
great
brew
anytime
d
although
i
rated
everything
else
rather
poorly
it
does
well
as
a
regular
session
beer
yuengling
is
a
traditionally
inexpensive
very
availible
beer
that
all
in
all
is
the
common
mans
champion
of
good
wholesome
brew
above
par
appearence
from
the
usual
mass
market
brews
its
rich
and
amber
with
little
head
smeel
is
rather
paltry
but
the
taste
comes
in
above
par
as
stated
before
nothing
too
strong
a
bit
bitter
but
all
in
all
just
a
fantastic
smooth
brew
nothing
out
of
the
ball
park
but
all
in
all
good
americas
most
overrated
beer
it
isnt
bad
but
cmon
its
not
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
it
has
an
ok
malt
taste
but
not
that
strong
of
one
kinda
weak
the
hop
flavoraroma
is
mild
at
best
i
will
say
that
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
leaves
no
harsh
afertaste
this
is
quite
a
popular
beer
in
the
pa
area
in
which
i
live
really
a
classic
and
is
enjoyed
by
all
sorts
of
people
pours
a
pleasant
copperamber

with
initially
a
robust
head
which
dwindles
down
to
small
traces
of

with
a
husky
feeling
in
the
nose
a
slight
pinch
of
hops
at
the
end
balances
out
the
malty
sweetness
it
is
really
a
pretty
good
beer
however
it
may
leave
you
with
the
feeling
that
there
is
more
to
be
desired
as
this
beer
may
seem
somewhat
watery
can
drink
these
all
day
and
wish
that
they
were
available
in
indianaway
better
than
the
regular
swill
verdict
intense
flavors
lacking
this
lager
is
still
a
decent
buy
and
could
be
as
likely
a
good
party
beer
as
a
comfort
drinker
for
one

than

brews
c

the
oldest
brewery
in
north
american
still
makes
one
of
the
most
drinkable
lagers
beautiful
amber
nicely
balanced
malty
sweetness
but
with
enough
taste
to
justify
being
a
decent
session
ale
definitely
not
a
lager
that
needs
to
advertise
cold
as
a
flavour
increasing
demand
bodes
well
for
the
increasing
expectations
of
american
beer
consumers
there
is
hope
good
to
be
back
on
the
east
coast
enjoying
one
of
the
finer
us
lagers
an
old
favorite
a
nice
orange
lager
pleasant
carbonation
it
is
slightly
sweet
a
little
toasty
a
dry
and
slightly
spicy
finish
slight
bitterness
balancing
the
malty
sweetness
of
the
lager
nice
round
booty
body
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
my
pour
created
a
finger
of
eggshellwhite
head
with
low
retention
fizzing
its
way
out
of
existence
color
was
a
deep
copperyorangish
amber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
like
pure
unadulterated
lager
slightly
sweet
with
a
mild
maltiness
that
was
pleasant
to
take
in
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
lager
sweetness
on
the
tongue
it
seems
pretty
unobtrusive
to
me
these
days
having
been
a
selfavowed
hophead
and
then
getting
on
the
canquest
tm
kick
which
led
to
a
lot
of
american
adjunct
lager
consumption
this
struck
me
as
a
nice
easydrinking
beer
that
i
could
easily
use
to
fill
a
cooler
for
a
picnic
or
a
barbecue
the
abv
is
reasonable
and
the
taste
is
not
going
to
put
anybody
off
the
finish
was
slightly
dry
and
nicely
pleasant
d
this
is
where
this
beer
shines
this
is
my
go
to
and
as
a
macro
i
believe
it
is
the
best
for
the
quality
i
really
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
i
cant
get
it
in
il
but
picked
up
a
can
in
tn
specifically
to
review
because
of
its
reputation
i
hope
its
just
a
mishandled
can
because
if
all
yuengling
tastes
like
rubber
then
i
cant
trust
any
more
east
coasters
ba
opinions
anymore
the
beer
pours
a
crisp
amber
color
with
small
head
and
decent
lacing
light
taste
of
some
dark
fruits
and
overall
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
pa
born
and
raised
this
is
my
go
to
at
bars
as
it
can
be
found
everywhere
a
great
session
beer
and
overall
a
very
well
done
brew
not
a
bad
beer
but
absolutely
unworthy
of
its
reputation
better
macro
beers
than
yuengling
coors
original
straub
d
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
it
were
on
hand
great
flavors
but
not
overwhelming
in
any
way
this
one
would
be
a
great
beer
for
drinking
while
doing
something
else
golfing
bowling
backyard
bbq
very
nice
glad
to
actually
try
it
bought
12
oz
bottle
at
longwood
gardens
the
other
choices
there
were
heineken
and
amstel
light
pours
amber
with
a
white
foamy
head
looks
good
actually
aroma
of
piney
hops
grass
and
some
grain
watery
on
the
palate
but
somewhat
tangy
in
terms
of
flavor
well
i
did
not
notice
any
definitely
some
earthy
hops
kick
in
the
finish
beats
any
other
macro
lager
for
me
great
drinkability
probably
the
best
macro
lager
on
the
market
would
be
an
outstanding
laying
around
the
beach
type
beer
yuengling
traditional
lager
has
a
light
amber
colour
and
a
head
that
dies
away
quickly
and
is
replaced
by
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
unimpressive
very
grainy
the
taste
is
slightly
malty
and
sweet
with
a
crisp
and
pleasant
aftertaste
it
has
a
reasonable
medium
body
and
is
very
drinkable
this
is
the
best
beer
you
will
find
in
shitty
pubs
when
it
comes
to
americanstyle
lagers
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
i
can
see
the
appeal
very
clean
and
malty
dark
beer
not
sold
in
ohio
unfortunately
i
have
to
go
to
pennsylvania
to
drink
this
beer
its
a
good
example
of
a
regular
american
lager
and
much
tastier
than
many
of
its
counterparts
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
and
i
wish
the
nights
were
longer
session
beer
with
enough
taste
to
keep
it
interesting
not
bad
at
all

and
flavorful
bready
caramel
malts
are
balanced
nicely
with
a
mild
hop
flavour
medium

with
a
clean

overall
a
classic
blue
collar
lager
that
gets
the
job
done
no
yuengling
in
ohio
so
cases
were
bought
in
pa
as
well
as
having
had
plenty
of
the
same
wfriends
who
brought
back
from
pa
smell
is
very
mild
kind
of
a
funky
skunk
but
not
strong
for
green
glass
nice
strong
amber
color
helps
as
does
the
case
which
keeps
it
dark
very
drinkable
compared
to
lord

finishes
wa
malty
skunk

tells
ya
to
keep
em
cold
for
me
much
like
molson
canadian
this
is
a
good
middle

the
road
lager
thats
great
wa
meal
and
for
drinking
all
night
if
need
be
you
can
get
a
good
buzz
with
good
flavor
wo
goin
cheap
and
feeling
total
bloat
and
no
buzz
wish
yuengling
would
sell
in
ohio
i
enjoyed
their

im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
historic
beer
but
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
the
beer
is
amber
in
color
and
appears
clear
the
head
is
an
inch
thick
and
leaves
a
nice
sheet
of
lacing
on
the
glass
noticeably
different
than
the
draft
version
i
reviewed
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
and
typical
american
lager
scents
the
beer
tastes
simple
and
plain
with
a
slight
sweetness
that
grows
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
a
decent
offering
and
sometimes
the
best
beer
available
as
is
the
case
tonight
this
beer
continues
to
be
a
maintainable
in
my
life
for
its
good
quality
low
price
and
decent
availableness
pours
a
nice
brownish
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
has
all
the
qualities
a
good
lager
should
have
over
all
the
high
point
to
this
beer
is
the
fusion
of
good
quality
brew
with
great
drinkablity
and
good
prices
i
commend
yuengling
on
all
of
their
beers
for
all
of
these
qualities
feels
a
little
light
in
the
mouth
but
very
drinkable
its
been
a
session
beer
in
prior
years
overall
a
lager
i
wish
were
available
in
my
area
my
neighbor
hit
pa
a
couple
times
a
year
and
says
this
stuff
runs
aprox
20cs
i
believe
ill
have
him
snatch
an
extra
one
for
me
next
time
d
easily
an
all
night
drink
if
its
what
youre
looking
for
in
a
college
town
its
probably
going
to
be
one
of
the
best
things
thatll
be
on
most
restaurant
menus
great
for
gameday
d
a
quality
beer
for
getting
hammered
on
but
not
just
for
tasting
purposes
d
refreshing
drinkable
since
its
so
watery
skunkiness
is
strong
i
wouldnt
buy
one
d
i
personally
consider
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
smooth
and
tastybut
not
excessively
filling
its
a
nice
sessionable
beer
wanted
this
tick
forever
not
worth
the
wait

you

fairly

little

there
is
a
reason
i
never
liked
this
drinkable
i
suppose
ive
had
a
few
today
d
this
is
easy
to
drink
lager
this
is
a
go
to
beer
if
there
not
much
out
there
but
bmc
while
i
dont
search
it
out
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
in
the
future
dvery
high
this
is
a
good
sessioning
beer
for
most
anything
given
the
price
and
expanded
distribution
of
the
last
few
years
most
anyone
in
the
northeast
should
be
able
to
get
this
and
at
under
20

a
casethirty
pack

cant
go

grabbed
this
while
down
on
li
and

it
smelled
a
little
skunked
not
terriblemay
have
to
rereview
after
i
try
a
fresh
batch
tastes
really
good
though
nice
full
mouthfeel
toovery
drinkable
beer
wish
i
could
get
it
around
here
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
thus
helping
to
make
this
lager
easy
to
drink
a
good
session
beer
its
too
bad
they
dont
sell
yuengling
in
kentucky
this
would
be
a
regular
part
of
the
rotation
in
the
fridge
a
very
good
beer
for
the
money
as
well
drinkability
light
refreshing
and
tasty
this
is
a
very
easy
quaffer
i
admit
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
yuengling
traditional
lager
and
i
have
had
them
in
the
green
bottles
and
now
in
cans
i
prefer
the
cans
lighter
body
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
little
dry
without
too
much
lingering
feel
very
easy
to
drink
especially
in
copious
amounts
one
of
my
favorite
cheaper
lagers
which
still
has
a
bit
of
actual
flavor
d
yuenglings
lager
is
sessionable
but
not
necessarily
enjoyable
and
for
better
or
worse
tastes
just
like
corn
pops
you
know
the
little
yellow
balls
of
sweet
corn
cereal
seriously
i
could
close
my
eyes
and
convince
myself
that
im
eating
breakfast
this
is
probably
my
favorite
commercially
made
lager
its
usually
the
best
thing
on
at
most
restaurants
i
tried
my
best
to
rate
this
beer
as
fairly
as
possible
because
its
my
favorite
beer
everyone
has
their
goto
beer
and
this
one
is
mine
i
tried
my
best
to
not
give
a
bias
opinion
pours
a
dark
red
brown
color
with
a
thick
white
soapyrocky
head
with
tons
of
lacing
smells
really
boozy
with
some
hops
in
the
background
tastes
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
from
a
little
hops
in
there
but
mostly
malty
and
sweet
kinda
one
note
hints
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
are
pretty
good
yet
this
beer
is
nothing
if
not
drinkable
and
perfect
for
grilling
and
for
the
occasional
financially
lean
month
d
not
as
drinkable
as
a
light
beer
but
very
drinkable
compared
to
most
other
kinds
of
beer
has
an
an
original
and
defining
taste
to
it
that
makes
it
great
good
drinkability
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
small
head
smells
of
malts
and
tastes
like
malts
as
well
with
a
small
bit
of
hops
light
mouthfeel
goes
down
easily
and
quickly
definitely
much
much
better
than
your
standard
cheap
lager
i
wouldnt
mind
sipping
on
this
at
most
mainstream
bars
that
dont
stock
finer
beer
d
an
easy
drinking
and
good
little
lager
a
good
cheap
goto
sessionable
beer
gose
down
smooth
this
is
served
every
where
in
pa
it
has
a
breadyyeasty
taste
with
a
short
burst
of
subtle
citrus
hop
that
kind
of
has
a
bitterness
that
is
a
bit
sharp
it
also
has
a
caramel
graininess
that
i
find
to
be
pleasant
tasting
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
which
is
definitely
its
best
quality
overall
its
so
drinkable
that
its
very
easy
to
go
through
faster
than
you
would
your
average
craft
beer
light
beer
but
not
too
light
its
pretty
good
ill
definitely
pick
this
any
day
over
the
standard
3
d
very
drinkable
seeing
as
this
is
a
medium
lager
with
lower
alcohol
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
to
drink
if
youre
throwing
a
party
or
casually
drinking
its
not
too
challenging
and
goes
well
with
anything
and
its
not
very
alcoholic
its
not
one
of
my
absolute
favourites
by
any
measure
but
it
serves
a
very
good
purpose
and
theres
always
some
in
my
fridge
for
when
i
just
want
a
beer
plain
and
simple
d
better
than
most
lagers
decent
balance
decent
flavors
and
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
really
quite
good
the
alcohol
is
almost
completely
undetectable
coupled
with
the
pleasant
taste
and
crisp
character
yuengling
lager
is
a
way
way
better
option
than
the
bmc
dross
that
is
out
there
luckily
for
me
places
around
here
usually
carry
it
along
with
all
the
adjunct
lagers
so
this
is
my
goto
beer
for
bar
hopping
and
social
drinking
solid
solid
brew
i
would
say
beer
is
drinkable
but
most
lagers
are
not
much
going
on
to
make
me
want
to
have
another
next
time
will
have
the
barkeep
rug
in
the
sa
lager
instead
i
do
not
think
this
is
all
that
similar
to
each
other
my
brother
in
a
law
is
a
miller
light
drinker
who
love
yuengling
on
vacation
im
not
surprised
he
liked
leinenkugels
more
it
is
more
like
miller
light
to
me
you
know
this
is
one
beer
that
i
can
have
and
still
enjoy
its
better
than
most
of
the
generic
crud
at
an
average
bar
the
one
thing
these
folks
need
to
do
is
ditch
the
green
glass
bottles
solid
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
that
rivals
blcoorsmiller
on
price
for
a
6
pack
with
this
much
flavor
has
to
be
a
go
to
beer
if
there
such
a
thing
i
like
to
drink
this
beer
when
im
low
on
cash
but
want
a
decent
tasting
beer
its
proclaimed
as
americas
oldest
brewery
so
you
gotta
show
it
some
respect
good
beer
at
a
fair
price
i
drink
mostly
from
the
can
but
probably
prefer
it
from
the
tap
at
a
local
tavern
has
average
drinkability
i
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
but
i
will
definitely
get
one
when
i
get
the
chance
great
drinkability
way
better
than
any
macro
option
and
the
price
is
about
the
same
as
most
macro
beers
overall
yuengling
brews
a
quality
product
and
you
have
to
give
them
props
i
cant
believe
i
missed
out
on
trying
this
beer
years
ago
it
gets
overlooked
and
pushed
to
the
side
for
bigger
and
more
advertised
brews
i
picked
it
up
not
too
long
ago
and
found
that
this
is
a
well
hidden
secret
i
was
truly
set
to
my
budlights
and
new
belgium
beers
not
anymore
this
is
my
new
goto
beer
everyday
of
the
week
it
is
very
affordable
at
iga
roughly
4
for
a
6
pack
pretty
good
buzz
compared
to
any
other
lager
the
tatse
is
exceptional
however
the
labeling
can
be
deceiving
i
think
they
need
a
makeover
new
labeling
few
commercials
keep
the
same
ingredients
and
your
golden
if
i
had
the
money
i
would
try
to
buy
some
shares
from
the
owners
in
this
company
im
on
my
5th
beer
this
afternoon
and
i
wish
i
had
another
6
very
good
beer
defies
the
green
bottle
skuny
theory
lol
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
overly
so
because
the
taste
is
lousy
more
processed
tasting
than
characteristic
of
all
the
ingredients
would
never
buy
this
beer
and
would
only
drink
again
if
im
desparate
and
its
free
drinkability
by
itself
i
really
dont
care
for
this
beer
its
got
a
flavor
profile
that
just
leaves
me
cold
im
not
caring
for
it
with
food
it
becomes
much
better
in
washing
a
meal
down
and
i
think
then
the
flavors
compliment
things
more
overall
a
meh
experience
big
thanks
to
ba
woodychandler
for
this
one
drinkability
nice
and
refreshing
these
go
back
very
easily
and
are
great
during
the
summer
a
decent
offering
from
pa
especially
for
something
to
drink
every
day
if
the
generic
macros
arent
your
thing
at
any
rate
this
is
a
crappy
adjunct
lager
nothing
more
better
than
macros
but
definitely
nothing
outstanding
definitely
will
beat
your
ordinary
macro
any
day
of
the
week
however
i
feel
as
if
i
can
drink
this
when
i
want
something
simple
and
cheap
and
not
have
to
turn
in
my
craft
drinker
card
you
could
do
worse
dont
ever
mind
buying
yuengling
even
though
it
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
never
a
bad
thing
to
support
a
legacy
of
family
owned
and
operated
business
the
best
by
far
in
the
yuengling
family
no
real
color
no
bitterness
though
either
beer
maintains
taste
though
through
out
the
length
of
the
first
gulp
to
the
last
every
time
good
with
all
foods
in
my
opinion
reminds
me
of
the
first
beer
i
ever
tasted
in
a
plesant
way
a
mgd
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
as
its
great
for
a
session
and
yuengling
is
still
a
family
owned
brewery
that
made
it
through
prohibition
and
has
thankfully
not
sold
out
to
anheuserbusch
as
you
enjoy
this
drinkable
lager
you
can
also
feel
good
about
supporting
a
family
owned
and
operated
brewery
that
takes
pride
in
its
heritage
and
serves
a
purpose
higher
than
the
almighty
dollar
not
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
but
that
goes
for
the
bad
things
as
well
i
would
imagine
that
the
flavor
would
get
lost
if
these
guys
werent
great
brewers
and
had
some
off
flavors
in
there
or
didnt
use
decent
ingredients
all
the
bad
beer
should
be
this
good
smells
of
metal
mouthfeel
of
water
but
there
still
remains
a
bite
that
can
not
be
denied
you
can
drink
them
all
day
as
long
as
boredom
doesnt
sit
in
although
getting
buzzed
is
impossible
with
this
eagle
of
4
4
abv
is
it
a
snob
thing
to
downplay
the
great
american
lager
maybe
but
i
am
not
excited
to
drink
this
d
its
okay
but
not
super
enjoyable
drinks
easy
for
what
it
is
could
do
a
few
in
a
pinch
d
a
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
this
beer
is
really
impressive
when
compared
to
similarly
priced
beers
there
really
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
one
other
than
that
i
drink
it
quite
a
bit
i
e
not
worth
going
down
the
astmd
analysis
like
i
would
for
a
craft
like
many
of
you
i
avoid
budweiser
and
other
macros
like
the
plague
and
can
hardly
stand
most
mainstream
lagers
preferring
to
drink
water
than
that
swill
but
yuengling
lager
is
an
exception
to
me
this
beer
is
genuinely
good
to
the
point
that
ill
often
buy
a
12pack
and
down
it
in
a
little
over
a
weeks
time
if
your
in
an
area
where
crafts
are
hard
to
come
by
or
you
need
a
beer
for
a
party
or
your
a
little
short
on
cash
i
highly
recommend
picking
this
one
up
if
youve
never
tried
it
before
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
beers
that
i
can
easily
drink
several
in
one
sitting
it
has
a
dark
amber
color
and
a
light
ring
of
foam
that
follows
it
through
the
beer
it
has
a
light
but
indistinguishable
hop
aroma
which
is
neutral
and
pairable
with
foods
such
as
pizza
burgers
and
fried
foods
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
easy
drinking
through
the
evening
d
i
can
and
do
drink
this
beer
as
much
as
possible
i
always
start
with
a
fine
craft
or
import
beer
and
move
to
this
as
the
night
goes
on
da
veryvery
drinkable
beer
the
tastes
stays
even
if
it
were
binge
session
high
volumes
can
be
consumed
while
constantly
appreciating
the
taste
i
could
have
a
bunch
of
these
easy
drinking
taste
kinda
holds
it
back
a
bit
but
overall
not
bad
good
pour
into
chilled
45f
mug
resulting
in
a
nice
white
fluffy
head
head
dissipates
down
to
a
light
covering
with
good
clinging
lacing
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
16
on
the
srm
chart
light
smell
of
lightly
roasted
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
it
smells
stronger
than
the
taste
which
is
pleasant
but
nothing
notable
just
a
little
bit
of
bite
from
the
hops
but
nothing
else
overpowering
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
which
seems
to
be
responsible
for
the
lingering
aftertaste
feels
great
on
the
tongue
and
upper
pallet
nice
carbonation
not
a
heavy
beer
by
no
means
but
a
good
pleasant
flavor
good
availability
i
can
find
this
in
the
bottle
all
over
at
a
reasonable
price
will
spread
it
to
my
friends
at
our
next
gathering
d
this
is
one
you
could
have
a
few
of
d
real
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
d
fairly
high
considering
the
price
point
this
beer
is
a
clear
winner
over
its
peers
worth
seeking
out
not
the
best
amberred
lager
but
the
best
for
the
price
by
a
long
shot
nice
beer
and
i
can
see
why
people
try
so
hard
to
find
it
dpretty
drinkable
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
sixpack
of
it
but
was
farily
suprised
when
i
tried
it
not
bad
yuengling
lager
the
best
all
around
brew
period
no
matter
where
you
go
in
nc
if
you
are
looking
for
a
decent
solid
tasty
beer
it
is
highly
likely
that
the
corner
store
will
carry
it
the
grocery
store
will
have
24
packs
of
cans
for
less
than
15
bucks
and
the
bars
will
have
it
on
tap
at
the
same
price
as
budlight
miller
coors
etc
it
is
a
goto
beer
as
many
have
stated
and
it
has
become
my
staple
beer
of
choice
over
the
years
d
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
because
its
great
drinkability
i
think
thats
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
its
not
amazing
but
it
will
do
for
a
nice
night
of
relaxing
or
a
game
with
the
guys
dpretty
high
considering
the
style
meant
to
be
enjoyed
not
rushed
for
sure
but
is
sessionable
the
lager
everyone
reverts
to
when
in
trouble
great
overall
beer
no
downsides
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
only
buy
it
if
i
was
at
a
bar
with
only
bmc
this
is
drinkable
and
does
go
down
fairly
easily
good
amber
tones
very
copper
and
a
beautiful
transparency
a
fast
fleeting
head
a
decent
smell
with
a
sent
of
pen
ink
to
my
sense
which
i
find
cool
not
a
bad
amber
a
good
little
malt
taste
clouds
about
the
back
of
the
mouth
pretty
average
as
far
as
craft
beers
go
nothing
special
that
jumps
out
at
you
but
nothing
that
takes
away
from
it
either
a
watery
feel
that
almost
evaporates
across
the
tongue
could
have
a
session
with
this
easily
overall
not
bad
the
drying
finish
improves
the
drinkability
score
by
a
ton
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
and
a
more
clean
profile
would
send
it
through
the
roof
reasonably
priced
and
one
of
my
favorite
beer
so
far
overall
sometimes
i
think
there
is
a
jekyll
hyde
skit
going
on
with
yuengling
sometimes
i
try
it
and
get
a
crisp
lager
with
sulfury
yeast
driven
flavors
other
times
i
get
this
boring
too
sweet
caramel
flavor
this
time
is
the
latter
this
is
a
step
up
from
the
budweiser
but
nothing
to
seek
out
this
is
a
massively
drinkable
clean
little
beer
with
just
enough
character
to
keep
ones
interest
drinkability
refreshing
and
palatable
the
quality
of
yuengling
speaks
for
itself
definitely
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
regularly
a
solid
session
beer
for
even
the
budgetconscious
and
one
that
comes
through
with
a
lot
more
character
than
the
rest
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
light
amberorange
with
a
2
finger
light
foamy
head
low
retention
smells
of
sweet
roasted
almonds
ciderlike
in
taste
with
a
subtle
hint
of
caramel
moderately
carbonated
with
a
dry
finish
that
is
pleasant
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
quite
flavorful
and
has
great
personality
along
with
being
very
well
priced
the
same
price
as
budweiser
but
better
in
quality
by
leaps
and
bounds
a
great
goto
beer
when
you
are
strapped
for
cash
this
beer
bites
sharply
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
and
the
lips
but
it
isnt
any
reason
to
dislike
it
i
enjoy
the
carbonation
that
hits
you
the
nice
alcohol
feeling
that
hits
you
is
also
very
inviting
surprising
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
however
12
of
these
are
easy
enough
to
drink
and
have
a
good
time
d
i
would
drink
this
anytime
anywhere
it
is
good
at
the
bar
good
with
my
dinner
and
good
at
the
game
it
is
a
magical
beer
drinkability
far
from
an
outstanding
beer
this
is
pretty
average
overall
however
it
is
usually
priced
about
the
same
as
bmc
beers
and
is
much
more
flavorful
while
remaining
just
as
sessionable
a
superb
standby
if
all
else
fails
md
watery
feel
and
taste
but
with
4
4
abv
your
not
going
to
get
a
lot
of
body
and
it
feels
appropriate
anyway
intelligent
folk
around
here
will
pick
this
up
rather
than
a
bmc
and
gives
hope
there
is
desire
to
taste
beer
out
there
a
good
brew
at
a
good
price
first
had
this
beer
at
bachelor
party
for
my
brother
in
law
smells
wonderful
and
the
taste
is
unique
but
a
taste
that
makes
you
want
more
this
is
a
mans
beer
for
sure
was
a
little
intimidated
by
the
green
bottle
but
the
green
bottle
is
just
a
small
price
for
a
good
beer
such
as
this
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
if
it
was
available
here
i
would
probably
keep
some
in
the
fridge
during
the
summer
months
amber
colored
clear
beer
that
pours
a
fine
1
head
that
disspates
really
quickly
fine
carbonation
bubbles
rise
quickly
to
the
top
smell
is
average
at
best
not
very
much
there
to
smell
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
quick
bitter
end
its
a
good
lager
but
doesnt
standout
carbonation
leaves
quickly
so
taste
gets
worse
as
you
drink
light
bodied
and
light
carbonation
good
to
drink
for
price
d
its
an
easy
drinker
but
sort
of
lacking
a
wow
factor
it
becomes
a
little
bland
in
the
middle
of
a
session
like
drinking
34
pints
while
watching
soccer
with
your
brotherinlaw
its
a
nice
option
when
looking
for
a
something
straight
forward
on
the
east
coast
d
i
can
drink
this
any
time
its
one
of
my
favorites
and
one
of
the
best
high
recommended
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
a
sweet
natural
earthy
smell
the
taste
is
a
nice
light
crisp
sweet
beer
with
a
maltyhoppy
taste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
due
to
its
lightness
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
which
dissapted
quickly
no
lace
to
speak
of
nose
is
lemon
faint
spice
corn
and
some
bready
malt
taste
is
lemon
grain
corn
presence
of
sweet
malt
and
the
tiniest
hop
tinge
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
or
lighter
there
is
decent
carbonation
but
it
gives
the
beer
only
a
tiny
edge
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
this
beer
is
the
only
macro
i
can
still
tolerate
not
fantastic
but
no
awful
either
d
this
is
where
this
beer
shines
this
is
a
standard
where
i
come
from
and
it
is
for
a
reason
its
so
good
for
a
bbq
and
a
long
day
of
pounding
god
bless
drinkability
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
although
there
isnt
enough
in
the
taste
department
to
be
anything
special
an
inoffensive
thirst
quencher
drinkability
a
go
to
if
you
find
yourself
in
a
dive
bar
anywhere
near
the
state
of
pa
has
a
decent
malt
profile
that
doesnt
really
get
in
the
way
of
anything
else
while
you
wont
find
me
picking
this
up
at
my
local
you
might
find
me
going
for
this
with
a
basket
of
hot
wings
overall
this
must
have
been
a
fresh
keg
because
it
was
the
best
yuengling
i
have
ever
had
it
had
none
of
the
musty
notes
i
have
noticed
from
other
bottles
cans
and
pints
on
draft
i
have
had
before
i
drank
it
to
celebrate
the
us
beating
algeria
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
notes
a
couple
of
notches
above
the
awful
macro
mainstream
but
little
else
pours
a
dark
amber
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
malt
up
front
in
this
lager
refreshing
taste
hints
of
caramel
flavor
very
smooth
mouthfeel
in
this
american
amber
lager
doesnt
have
huge
flavor
but
a
well
done
subtlety
exists
high
drinkability
despite
the
lack
of
flavor
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
to
have
around
to
make
the
real
good
stuff
go
farther
and
is
good
for
quenching
your
thirst
after
a
long
day
a
thin
beer
and
perhaps
a
very
good
session
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
the
qualities
of
macro
with
a
little
more
flavoring
the
hop
is
less
pronounced
on
the
tongue
easy
to
drink
and
perhaps
very
nice
after
a
long
hot
day
went
great
with
my
chopped
pork
sandwich
one
of
the
best
meals
i
have
ever
had
d
very
drinkable
perhaps
the
best
choice
if
you
just
want
something
refreshing
and
nothing
to
sit
and
talk
about
with
your
friend
this
isnt
a
conversational
beer
just
a
beer
to
quench
your
thirst
not
something
id
seek
out
but
it
did
go
down
quickly
and
it
was
1
for
a
pint
on
tap
good
value
for
the
money
here
especially
when
compared
to
its
competition
amber
but
not
very
reddish
more
copper
this
beer
has
a
pleasant
slight
maltiness
overall
taste
is
clean
balanced
unadventurous
with
the
bit
of
maltiness
being
the
defining
character
like
this
style
should
the
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
and
prickly
like
most
macro
lagers
and
carbonation
is
rather
high
while
nothing
stands
out
this
is
a
decent
and
easily
available
lager
if
you
like
slight
maltiness
i
think
creemore
springs
is
a
far
more
delicious
beer
of
this
type
but
its
unfortunately
not
widely
available
rjt
not
bad
but
really
nothing
stands
out
probably
goes
best
with
plain
traditional
food
meat
and
potatoes
this
would
be
a
goto
party
beer
if
it
were
available
in
new
england
thankfully
we
have
gansett
to
fill
that
void
but
man
would
i
love
some
choices
within
the
low
price
point
category
overall
so
glad
i
finally
got
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
make
a
great
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
thanks
gar
o
a
great
example
to
style
only
recommendation
is
for
more
of
the
darker
malt
presence
in
aroma
and
taste
this
is
my
all
time
favorite
and
the
one
that
is
always
available
in
my
home
thus
the
lofty
ratings
many
others
are
in
a
rotation
of
the
brews
i
love
to
try
to
bring
in
some
variety
or
to
enjoy
as
seasonals
are
released
in
bottle
or
on
tap
this
is
handsdown
my
benchmark
for
comparisons
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
corn
wheat
and
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
a
lot
of
corn
and
bready
malts
with
some
very
light
hopping
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
terrible
but
not
something
would
like
to
try
again
d
easy
to
drink
red
lageram
lager
i
would
order
another
one
as
far
as
this
style
is
concerned
im
damn
happy
we
get
brooklyn
and
not
this
one
d
if
this
is
selling
for
the
same
price
as
bud
back
east
then
they
are
getting
a
true
deal
this
is
good
stuff
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
a
beer
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
us
final
thoughts
well
as
i
commented
about
molson
earlier
this
beer
seems
to
be
very
similar
to
molson
canadian
in
that
it
is
a
marker
beer
when
you
think
what
an
average
generic
beer
should
taste
like
this
one
fits
the
bill
its
not
bad
its
just
well
what
it
is
id
pickup
a
six
pack
for
the
right
price
of
course
but
its
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
id
say
the
flavor
is
one
of
the
best
that
america
has
to
offer
i
prefer
it
over
the
major
domestic
three
the
color
is
more
brilliant
the
head
is
nice
and
you
can
drink
way
more
than
one
orangey
amber
with
a
shortlived
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
grainy
with
some
honey
and
caramel
notes
similar
taste
with
some
orange
zest
and
red
apple
skin
toward
the
finish
crisp
and
dry
this
makes
for
a
nice
after
work
beer
to
have
with
dinner
to
prime
the
palate
for
the
good
stuff
pours
a
dark
golden
color
or
light
amber
head
was
slightly
foamy
and
bubbly
went
to
ring
rather
quick
though
aroma
was
malty
and
wheaty
with
slight
hints
of
sweetness
to
it
however
the
wheat
dominated
the
taste
with
slight
bits
of
malts
to
it
and
minimal
bitterness
if
any
body
was
a
little
bit
watery
overall
i
can
see
why
people
would
drink
this
as
an
any
occasion
beer
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
ive
had
this
beer
so
many
times
in
so
many
contexts
i
guess
ive
never
really
sat
down
seriously
critiqued
it
so
much
history
with
this
that
its
almost
unfair
to
review
it
ive
had
this
pulling
allnighters
moving
at
weddings
watching
bands
playing
in
bands
just
hanging
out
not
the
greatest
but
reliable
never
disappointing
definitely
a
workhorse
beer
wide
available
inexpensive
always
a
welcome
alternative
to
macros
i
dont
mean
to
make
this
review
sound
like
an
ad
but
its
got
a
special
place
in
my
heart
and
its
really
easy
drinking
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
faint
maybe
a
little
grainy
taste
is
a
little
bready
and
toasty
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
that
probably
is
the
perfect
summer
outing
beer
if
you
havent
tried
one
i
would
recommend
to
give
at
least
one
shot
i
have
always
drank
this
and
will
continue
to
do
so
in
the
future
as
an
oregonian
for
most
of
my
life
i
have
only
recently
had
a
chance
to
try
yuengling
and
i
must
say
its
not
bad
its
amber
hue
is
better
looking
than
most
general
lager
and
the
taste
follows
suit
the
nose
is
fairly
normal
and
the
mouthfeel
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
nevertheless
this
is
an
easy
drinking
lager
thats
easy
to
find
and
a
welcomed
alternative
to
bmc
co
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
well
carbonated
nice
enough
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
beer
that
is
much
better
than
your
average
bmc
but
still
more
like
those
beers
than
like
craft
beer
notes
this
is
definitely
above
the
level
of
bmc
however
since
it
is
listed
as
an
amber
lager
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
it
it
lived
up
to
that
expectation
but
it
didnt
surpass
which
is
why
i
feel
it
deserves
the
average
rating
i
would
much
rather
have
this
than
bmc
when
i
want
a
cheaper
beer
however
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
volume
beer
it
fits
what
it
is
trying
to
be
very
nicely
taste
is
very
crisp
an
light
there
is
some
malt
but
not
too
much
the
hops
are
crisp
and
light
its
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
drinkability
is
average
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
down
but
i
really
dont
want
to
this
beer
isnt
going
to
wow
you
but
its
inexpensive
unoffensive
and
better
than
the
other
massproduced
american
lagers
huzzah
to
the
nightcap
overall
as
a
cheap
lager
this
isnt
half
bad
and
if
youre
on
a
budget
go
for
it
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
delicious
worldclass
lager
look
elsewhere
overall
this
is
a
beer
you
would
want
to
drink
if
you
dont
want
to
spend
a
lot
some
bars
that
serve
it
in
my
experiences
have
it
as
a
weekly
or
daily
special
so
youll
likely
get
a
great
deal
on
a
draft
or
pitcher
good
beer
this
is
what
bud
light
should
have
been
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
after
working
on
the
car
or
while
mowing
the
grass
you
crave
like
a
slice
of
pizza
every
time
you
think
of
it
it
tastes
different
in
order
to
accommodate
your
craving
basically
its
a
great
light
and
slightly
different
beer
that
is
wonderful
for
drinking
throughout
the
day
if
i
could
get
a
day
off
to
just
sit
around
the
house
this
would
be
one
of
the
beers
i
would
be
nursing
all
day
long
highly
decent
and
very
easy
to
slam
i
remember
the
first
time
i
had
a
yuengling
and
i
can
never
refuse
one
ever
since
it
has
a
good
amalgam
of
everything
you
want
in
a
beer
drinkability
as
always
for
this
beer
is
quite
impeccable
pours
a
nice
medium
amber
color
with
about
a
one
finger
head
that
leaves
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
the
color
is
very
nice
the
nose
is
very
grainy
citrusy
and
a
little
malty
the
taste
is
light
bodied
and
citrusy
as
well
as
very
grainy
kindof
bitter
but
not
from
the
hops
a
little
watery
but
not
over
the
top
like
a
bud
or
miller
average
mouthfeel
but
the
awkward
bitterness
doesnt
make
it
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
beer
is
a
light
shade
of
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
the
smell
is
a
nice
grain
aroma
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
citrus
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
it
has
a
medium
feel
with
crispness
and
a
dry
finish
goes
down
easy
and
is
an
excellent
session
brew
a
slight
nutty
malt
flavor
in
the
mouth
very
smooth
not
bad
for
a
big
brewer
beer
will
try
again
medium
copper
body
with
lighter
edges
pinkie
finger
of
dirty
beige
head
some
lacing
muted
nose
with
hints
of
honeyish
malts
some
toasted
grains
light
fruitiness
taste
starts
off
with
mild
grain
astringency
some
cardboard
and
a
little
caramel
a
little
more
caramel
comes
through
along
with
a
dash
of
fruit
and
a
pinch
of
earthy
tobacco
mild
vague
hop
bitterness
and
some
cooked
vegetables
in
the
finish
moderate
body
easy
drinking
very
quaffable
if
not
the
tastiest
beer
ive
had
this
is
a
great
beer
for
people
to
try
cheap
and
great
tasting
and
i
enjoy
it
every
time
i
have
one
overall
a
very
decent
example
of
the
style
worth
trying
if
you
never
have
a
classic
american
brew
to
be
enjoyed
all
times
but
especially
on
those
hot
summer
days
overall
good
session
beer
hot
too
harsh
and
very
palatable
ah
yuengling
lager
an
old
friend
that
i
discovered
many
years
ago
working
in
a
liquor
store
have
to
agreecans
are
way
to
go
with
this
brew
less
chance
of
skunk
and
really
do
taste
better
so
at
4
75
a
six
pack
locally
a
real
no
brainer
tastes
good
drinks
easy
locally
brewed
and
real
old
school
my
go
to
all
arounder
for
under
20
a
case
watching
football
and
drinking
all
day
though
color
is
golden
with
thick
head
when
poured
my
rating
may
be
biased
since
i
am
partial
to
ipas
and
dont
particuarly
care
for
american
lager
but
yuengling
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
mass
produce
american
lagers
though
not
spectacular
it
has
a
good
taste
and
the
price
is
extremely
right
d
muted
flavors
enhance
the
drinkability
for
some
if
the
purpose
is
to
session
this
one
for
me
personally
its
okay
for
that
reason
however
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
difficult
to
ignore
drinking
this
one
from
the
bottle
will
minimize
contact
with
its
strange
or
awful
scent
d
this
is
my
go
to
beer
when
buying
for
the
masses
you
can
really
put
down
a
bunch
of
these
no
problem
d
easy
to
drink
probably
the
best
cheap
american
lager
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
american
lager
style
one
of
the
best
i
have
tried
but
being
an
ale
guy
i
am
more
apt
to
pick
up
something
else
i
like
this
lager
it
has
a
nice
amber
appearance
that
has
leaves
a
decent
lace
on
the
glass
though
the
smell
is
not
to
strong
it
has
a
nice
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
good
with
a
balance
amount
of
ingredients
from
the
malts
and
hops
neither
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
bodied
with
a
smooth
drinkability
good
beer
just
not
very
much
on
abv
serving
type
bottle
fabulous
everyday
beer
and
at
under
20case
you
can
afford
to
do
so
not
too
heavy
not
to
light
the
bottles
always
have
a
smell
thats
not
off
but
not
wholesome
like
on
draft
the
beer
still
pairs
well
with
almost
anything
youre
eating
or
is
fine
by
itself
on
an
evening
out
or
home
watching
sports
yuengling
traditional
lager
poures
a
darker
brown
color
with
a
good
size
head
it
has
a
kinda
of
stale
smell
and
same
thing
with
the
taste
overall
its
not
a
really
bad
taste
but
its
nothing
too
speical
even
though
this
beer
wasnt
too
heavy
i
feel
its
hard
to
drink
more
then
one
it
is
filling
and
the
more
you
drink
the
more
the
stale
tastes
become
present
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
average
at
best
it
is
better
then
some
other
beers
out
there
but
defently
not
a
first
round
choice
d
sessionworthy
levels
of
lagered
bliss
so
darned
good
taste
smooth
no
hop
presence
lighter
than
its
appearance
mouthfeel
there
is
less
and
less
to
pick
up
on
further
down
the
bottle
drinkable
sure
but
i
look
at
this
as
one
of
those
introductory
beers
into
craft
brewing
like
anything
by
sa
i
dunno
i
guess
this
is
the
stuff
its
everywhere
in
philly
nj
ny
when
im
out
there
clear
copper
with
a
decent
two
finger
eggshell
head
of
dense
foam
that
leaves
scraps
of
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
corny
grits
and
a
whiff
of
floral
hops
the
flavors
are
mildly
sweet
and
adjuncty
with
minimal
hop
flavors
to
balance
light
bodied
with
seltzery
carbonation
a
goodeasy
drinkingevery
day
kind
of
brew
thin
watery
and
quite
crisp
on
the
tongue
not
bad
theres
just
nothing
to
go
on
really
i
will
say
it
is
refreshing
for
sure
this
is
the
goto
lager
for
easy
everyday
drinking
purposes
great
on
a
summer
day
it
is
miles
ahead
of
the
competition
d
goes
down
very
easy
i
finish
one
and
immediately
want
to
reach
for
another
one
an
excellent
summer
beer
more
character
than
a
typical
american
lager
serve
this
to
your
bmc
loving
fans
as
a
great
starter
beer
on
the
way
to
ipas
and
riss
well
worth
trying
i
loved
in
in
grad
school
in
fl
and
wish
i
could
get
this
in
ky
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
rubyamber
color
to
it
an
excellent
red
lager
heavily
influenced
by
the
german
and
irish
immigrants
whom
lived
in
pennsylvania
this
is
a
really
good
authentic
american
beer
and
being
that
it
is
from
americas
oldest
brewery
at
the
same
time
makes
this
beer
a
staple
in
american
beer
history
and
in
small
brew
legacies
this
beer
is
sweeter
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
small
but
decent
head
ok
retention
and
kicks
anheuser
busch
out
of
the
park
yuengling
vs
budweiser
the
american
lager
yuengling
wins
that
fight
by
far
i
highly
suggest
this
beer

one
general
warning
though
having
gone
to
college
outside
philadelphia
but
also
having
family
in
florida
i
have
to
say
the
discrepancy
between
the
lots
brewed
in
pa
and
fl
seems
to
be
large
ive
always
loved
it
in
pa
and
its
been
hit
or
miss
in
fl
d
the
best
of
a
bad
style
cheap
very
drinkable
tastes
good
a
winner
drinkabilityoverall
impression
high
how
do
i
know
ive
had
a
ton
of
this
in
my
day
it
was
one
of
the
two
beers
that
i
drank
regularly
after
i
weaned
myself
off
college
beer
and
before
i
discovered
craft
beer
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
compared
to
just
about
any
macro
offering
and
i
personally
think
it
stacks
up
quite
well
against
some
of
the
better
amber
lagers
out
there
as
well
though
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
my
judgment
might
be
clouded
by
geography
and
nostalgia
simple
sturdy
and
tasty
everyone
should
be
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
beer
like
this
available
to
switch
things
up
a
bit
from
our
typical
highgravity
palatecrushing
fare
when
such
a
beer
is
called
for
and
one
would
prefer
not
to
support
worldwide
massproducing
brewing
conglomerates
d
first
ive
had
in
many
years
i
liked
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
found
myself
making
the
choice
to
get
a
six
pack
of
this
while
in
wv
where
the
pickings
are
slightly
slim
this
is
a
good
brew
for
a
4
4
abv
and
relatively
enjoyable
overall
i
would
say
this
one
is
a
go
to
if
your
choices
are
limited
highly
recommended
over
some
of
the
other
low
abv
readily
available
abc
brews
available
compared
to
an
adjunct
lager
this
is
pretty
choice
compared
to
a
craft
brewed
amber
lager
this
is
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
and
my
score
reflects
the
latter
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
either
by
a
long
shot
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
smooth
cold
and
refreshing
id
take
this
over
a
large
majority
of
the
other
bmc
selections
out
there
any
day
drinkability
a
decent
macrobrew
certainly
nothing
special
but
for
the
price
its
one
of
the
best
macrobrews
you
can
get
notes
decent
carbonation
along
with
a
balanced
mouthfeel
all
that
and
being
very
drinkable
make
this
beer
a
winner
d
somewhat
bland
but
still
pretty
tasty
for
a
macro
much
better
than
your
typical
bmc
i
cant
get
this
is
ct
but
certainly
enjoy
a
few
yuenglings
when
i
have
a
chance
d
nothing
special
but
pretty
good
on
the
scale
of
traditional
american
lagers
while
the
flavor
aroma
arent
particularly
strong
they
are
more
pronounced
than
any
bmc
offerings
very
refreshing
i
also
prefer
this
to
their
black
tan
not
bad
at
all
for
66pack
reviewed
from
my
notes
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
is
light
copper
in
color
with
a
head
made
of
white
bubbles
there
is
lots
of
carbonation
rising
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
floral
and
bitter
hops
with
a
bit
of
earthy
yeast
all
i
wrote
about
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
fruity
hops
but
i
gave
it
a
4
rating
so
i
must
have
liked
it
it
has
a
medium
body
and
lots
of
carbonation
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
although
the
high
carbonation
levels
may
be
a
limiting
factor
d
quite
quaffable
d
again
hometown
brew
perfect
drinkability
just
light
enough
to
be
a
session
lager
d
pretty
good
macro
very
drinkable
you
could
easily
go
through
a
good
amount
of
these
d
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
whose
quality
boarders
between
a
macro
and
a
micro
could
definitely
session
a
bunch
of
these
and
ill
drink
a
few
on
occasion
when
the
only
alternative
is
american
adjuncts
definitely
drinkable
and
at
4
4
good
for
a
session
this
beer
made
a
good
first
impression
but
then
seemed
to
fade
away
quickly
the
head
evaporated
the
beer
went
flat
in
short
this
beer
if
you
like
crispish
lagers
with
a
citrus
background
is
probably
for
you
but
it
is
not
for
me
it
was
a
little
sweet
or
yellowbeer
tasting
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
quality
since
i
am
a
fan
of
yuenglings
black
and
tan
i
was
expecting
something
softer
and
more
complex
cheers
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
fairly
unique
in
flavor
scent
and
feel
definitely
a
brew
i
will
have
to
try
again
d
i
could
drink
about
a
million
of
these
and
have
tried
several
times
during
college
a
great
beer
for
slugging
down
some
wings
or
a
burger
or
just
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
cheers
great
beer
for
all
kinds
of
situations
and
it
comes
in
cans
dgoes
down
pretty
easy
i
remember
it
being
quite
a
bit
better
and
the
corn
was
not
as
dominant
in
my
memory
i
guess
my
palate
has
developed
this
is
still
a
nice
cheap
everyday
drinker
just
ask
for
a
lager
everyone
in
pa
knows
what
you
want
if
you
need
to
clarify
it
is
pronounced
yingling
drinkablity
tasty
and
accessible
brew
a
very
good
regional
brew
first
off
thanks
rustydiamond
for
the
beer
ive
been
craving
this
stuff
for
a
year
this
is
an
american
standard
that
needs
to
make
it
our
here
on
the
west
coast
it
may
seem
a
bit
watered
down
from
what
most
people
are
saying
they
drink
everyday
but
compared
to
its
own
style
this
beer
is
the
goods
malty
overtones
with
a
clean
light
finish
simple
but
solid
i
may
need
to
set
up
another
trade
to
get
some
more
bottle
into
pint
glass
i
may
be
very
biased
as
this
has
always
been
a
staple
but
i
love
this
one
pours
a
beautiful
deep
amber
color
with
a
creamy
head
and
good
lacing
nose
is
of
a
slight
toffee
sweetness
and
a
slight
hop
mixed
in
drinks
very
smooth
with
a
slight
sharp
bite
of
the
hops
at
the
end
a
little
heavier
than
most
macrobrewed
lagers
as
yuengling
is
hardly
small
anymore
but
not
as
overbearingly
in
your
face
as
some
micros
a
great
middle
of
the
road
choice
excellent
compliment
to
a
chargrilled
burger
it
is
more
flavorful
and
fuller
bodied
than
its
macro
counterparts
so
i
give
it
a
little
bump
in
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
alternative
to
the
macro
mainstays
d
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
day
pretty
drinkable
brew
wish
it
was
available
in
ct
just
so
maybe
it
would
be
at
more
picnics
that
i
go
to
d
extremely
drinkable
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
of
the
uninspired
macros
reasonably
priced
and
readily
available
in
a
good
portion
of
the
eastern
us
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
other
mass
produced
american
lagers
its
a
no
frills
utilitarian
brew
but
tasty
nonetheless
and
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
d
always
a
nice
find
among
the
crowd
of
usual
suspects
at
a
bar
or
party
definitely
a
beer
that
i
have
more
than
one
of
when
im
drinking
it
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
maybe
the
best
lager
out
there
a
very
malty
almost
biscuit
sweet
flavour
most
defines
this
beer
decent
colour
and
a
lacking
nose
are
made
up
for
by
the
sessionable
nature
of
the
beer
good
head
colour
and
pleasing
dark
body
very
easy
drinking
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
poured
from
a
bomber
bottle
into
a
23
ounce
glass
golden
amber
in
appearance
with
about
an
inch
of
foamy
head
medium
carbonation
that
bubbles
to
the
top
of
the
glass
not
an
overly
strong
scent
but
i
can
detect
some
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
smooth
and
balanced
malts
and
hops
seem
about
balanced
not
real
after
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
very
drinkable
to
me
one
of
my
stand
by
beers
because
over
the
years
it
has
been
very
thirst
quenching
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
today
it
is
providing
a
nice
change
up
from
the
heavier
seasonal
beers
side
note
if
you
have
the
chance
take
the
brewery
tour
its
free
and
well
worth
it
d
like
i
said
earlier
i
could
drink
these
all
day
on
a
warm
summer
day
after
work
i
can
sit
out
on
the
back
deck
and
drink
these
all
day
this
is
nowhere
near
my
favorite
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
of
times
when
ill
order
a
lager
when
im
back
east
just
on
principle
or
for
nostalgic
reasons
drinkability
very
smooth
and
tasty
great
alternative
to
bmc
products
great
refreshing
beer
way
better
than
a
lot
of
macros
out
there
this
is
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
being
from
pa
its
almost
ingrained
in
me
to
enjoy
this
beer
i
love
the
taste
i
love
the
price
and
i
love
the
idea
of
the
history
of
this
beer
great
beer
for
discerning
college
beer
aficianados
it
isnt
quite
on
the
level
of
other
craft
beers
but
it
blows
ab
and
other
mass
beers
out
of
the
water
d
really
drinkable
great
session
lager
pour
samber
with
two
fingers
of
head
the
head
dissapears
almost
immediately
though
the
smell
is
about
half
and
half
lager
flavor
does
no
tliv
eup
to
the
malt
smell
at
all
there
is
a
much
more
obvious
malt
taste
than
a
macro
lager
but
its
still
a
very
plain
and
slightly
watery
tasting
beer
not
heavily
carbonated
at
all
reminds
me
of
a
lessflavorful
amber
bock
more
than
anything
very
drinkable
but
nt
particularly
special
still
an
old
dfavorite
d
again
very
good
its
a
little
filling
but
if
youre
a
pro
you
can
drink
it
all
night
it
also
pairs
well
with
just
about
any
kind
of
food
i
know
this
from
experience
im
a
pennsylvania
native
so
i
drink
it
with
just
about
every
dinner
a
great
brew
all
around
the
only
down
side
is
it
a
nonunion
american
brewery
oh
well
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
us
and
growing
faster
than
any
brewer
this
size
my
only
regret
is
i
cant
get
in
la
draft
poured
a
deep
amber
color
lager
with
a
medium
foray
head
with
ok
retention
aroma
of
nice
creamy
caramel
malt
with
light
sweet
notes
taste
is
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
with
creamy
texture
and
some
well
balanced
caramel
malt
body
is
fuller
then
average
with
great
carbonation
and
a
nice
creamy
texture
nothing
earth
shattering
but
very
well
done
nonetheless
d
a
pretty
decent
lager
good
for
a
nice
reliable
and
refreshing
drink
when
no
better
beers
are
present
personally
i
feel
that
the
ontap
version
of
this
beer
is
much
better
than
what
you
get
from
the
bottle
decent
drinking
we
look
to
this
beer
as
a
filler
to
switch
things
up
all
in
all
at
least
a
step
or
two
above
most
massproduced
lagers
overall
yuengling
is
a
good
beer
for
a
good
price
in
any
general
bar
setting
with
little
drink
variety
ill
take
this
in
a
pinch
over
the
standard
brandname
beers
its
nearly
everywhere
you
go
in
pa
so
i
usually
have
this
to
fall
back
on
got
turned
on
to
this
when
i
was
in
harrisburg
2
12
years
ago
it
is
definately
a
worth
while
regular
drinking
beer
that
puts
any
budweiser
or
miller
product
to
shame
if
i
could
get
this
in
michigan
or
ohio
it
would
be
my
regular
drinking
beer
instead
of
labatt
blue
about
twice
a
year
i
will
make
a
road
trip
to
pa
3
hour
drive
from
toledo
oh
area
and
get
a
couple
of
cases
to
have
on
hand
drinkable
and
i
suppose
i
could
get
used
to
it
if
it
was
around
its
better
than
rolling
rock
but
i
think
there
are
better
lagers
around
my
neck
of
the
woods
longboard
and
definately
a
lot
better
beer
in
the
pale
ale
category
thin
in
the
mouth
not
a
lot
of
flavor
some
back
of
the
mouth
flavor
nothing
offensive
just
nothing
there
some
cereal
maybe
corn
like
flavor
at
the
back
beer
is
wet
and
cold
nothing
special
here
originally
reviewed
on
september
8
2009
had
never
ever
heard
of
this
beer
but
was
on
vacation
in
fort
lauderdale
florida
my
wife
and
i
went
to
dinner
at
a
local
restuarant
on
the
beach
and
they
had
this
stuff
on
tap
i
was
curiouswife
got
the
usual
and
i
tried
one
of
these
beers
could
not
believe
it
may
have
been
the
most
flavorful
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
am
lobbying
the
indiana
state
alcohol
board
to
allow
this
beer
to
come
into
indiana
hopefully
it
happen
theres
really
nothing
profound
to
say
about
yuengling
its
priced
like
the
big
3
macro
lagers
but
has
much
more
flavor
and
is
very
drinkable
there
are
better
lagers
out
there
sure
but
this
is
always
a
great
go
to
beer
that
im
happy
to
keep
in
my
fridge
sadly
i
live
in
western
ct
and
have
to
take
a
short
ride
down
the
ol
road
to
pick
up
a
case
but
damn
its
worth
it
i
grew
up
in
pa
and
this
is
the
beer
of
choice
at
the
pub
especially
when
bud
and
coors
are
next
to
it
on
the
tap
it
has
a
nice
color
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
layer
of
foam
i
hate
when
they
dont
leave
enough
to
capture
the
aroma
it
has
a
nice
carbonated
feel
in
the
mouth
with
the
taste
of
mostly
hops
with
a
little
hops
from
the
cold
can
this
amber
lager
tastes
very
refreshing
and
light
with
a
bit
of
nutty
malt
sweetness
some
huskiness
though
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
soft
but
high
carbonation
aftertaste
is
not
particularly
inspiring
a
little
off
and
indicative
of
adjuncts
drink
it
cold
and
dont
think
about
it
too
much
like
i
said
i
enjoy
this
beer
for
what
it
is
easy
and
cheap
this
is
far
from
a
complex
beer
you
would
mull
over
it
is
too
carbonated
and
a
little
too
light
in
flavor
however
it
is
a
fine
quaffer
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
it
is
also
from
americas
oldest
brewery
as
mentioned
before
it
is
a
quality
beer
for
the
price
at
the
very
least
one
must
acknowledge
the
great
significance
the
yuengling
brewery
has
in
the
american
history
of
craft
beer
i
went
to
a
tour
of
the
brewery
this
past
weekend
and
now
look
at
this
brewery
in
a
much
different
and
positive
light
overall
an
easy
drinker
but
i
think
this
one
is
alot
of
hype
for
those
outside
of
a
distribution
area
a
refreshing
beer
but
a
bit
too
light
in
flavor
for
me
to
seek
this
out
again
this
is
pretty
nice
on
tap
review
from
notes
taken
on
92809
clear
light
ambergolden
pour
not
much
of
a
head
what
little
there
was
disappeared
quickly
sweet
cereal
smell
with
a
hint
of
vinegar
i
was
kind
of
expecting
this
to
taste
fairly
awful
but
that
wasnt
the
case
taste
was
sweet
with
some
metallic
notes
as
well
i
wouldnt
neccesarily
say
its
good
but
its
far
from
bad
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
sit
and
session
it
all
day
pours
a
clear
goldenamber
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
pale
hops
yeast
slight
sweet
malt
and
some
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
amber
red
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
hops
yeast
pale
malt
and
some
sweet
malt
in
the
finish
overall
a
decent
lager
that
has
no
outstanding
feature
this
is
better
than
pretty
much
any
of
the
bmcs
out
there
drinkability
is
fantastic
a
very
decent
brew
that
would
make
a
great
session
beer
i
feel
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
a
lager
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
yuengling
pours
a
predictable
amber
to
dark
copper
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
totally
leaving
no
lace
behind
aromas
are
not
a
whole
lot
to
talk
about
musty
grains
a
sweet
malt
background
and
metallic
flavors
are
similar
but
luckily
i
dont
taste
much
metallicskunk
its
just
a
really
mellow
crisp
easy
drinking
lager
that
both
reminds
me
of
bmc
and
also
sets
itself
apart
from
the
rest
its
a
damn
good
pizza
beer
for
sure
d
when
i
was
young
we
always
thought
yuengling
lager
just
lager
to
most
of
us
in
southeast
pa
was
a
premium
brew
my
palate
has
changed
but
felt
good
to
crack
one
open
and
review
an
all
around
decent
beer
thats
better
than
most
bmc
products
d
definitely
a
drinkable
lager
much
better
than
most
bmc
macros
and
this
is
definitely
my
goto
in
college
especially
for
beerpong
and
keggers
go
tigers
while
at
a
crowded
bar
in
nyc
this
was
the
only
beer
not
readily
available
in
ma
so
this
was
my
beer
of
the
evening
i
have
heard
so
much
about
the
history
of
this
brewery
but
never
tried
their
product
poured
a
copper
red
color
very
little
head
sort
of
a
musty
smell
taste
was
a
bit
metallic
and
bitter
very
light
and
mellow
mouthfeel
though
while
not
insanely
flavorful
it
was
not
repulsive
lower
in
alcohol
than
i
expected
goes
down
smoothly
so
i
could
handle
a
few
pints
at
a
time
pretty
average
overall
this
beer
should
really
be
compared
to
american
macro
lagers
since
this
is
the
segment
of
the
market
that
it
really
competes
with
since
a
case
of
bottles
in
the
midatlantic
is
usually
around
18
much
like
bmc
a
much
better
beer
than
the
competitors
pricewise
at
least
and
a
beer
that
even
bas
can
find
value
in
the
dark
gold
to
light
brown
beer
with
a
small
head
looked
fairly
regular
to
me
in
my
glass
but
the
aroma
of
wheat
was
very
much
there
i
liked
the
first
taste
as
the
crisp
lager
stood
up
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
a
light
malty
base
i
found
drinking
it
to
be
easy
and
good
pairing
with
a
stuffed
roast
beef
hero
overall
readily
available
in
stores
in
these
parts
and
makes
for
a
decent
choice
for
a
lager
on
a
budget
d
highly
drinkable
beer
easily
a
beer
youd
have
no
problem
knocking
down
a
few
overall
a
solid
beer
albeit
slightly
overrated
poured
from
a
pint
bottle
into
a
beer
glass
brilliant
reddish
amber
colour
with
plenty
activity
going
on
settles
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lacing
at
all
it
has
a
flower
hop
smell
with
vinegary
sourness
it
has
a
stinging
taste
firm
with
plenty
of
bitterness
good
beer
to
have
when
you
are
not
looking
for
anything
too
heavy
or
fancy
d
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
d
very
drinkable
a
great
goto
beer
when
you
are
not
in
the
mood
for
something
fancy
comes
in
cans
d
a
good
drinkable
lager
not
like
the
popular
lagers
i
believe
this
beer
is
better
on
tap
especialy
if
it
is
shipped
long
distanses
pa
to
fl
i
think
this
is
better
drank
from
the
bottle
cold
or
on
draft
pooring
from
the
bottle
tended
to
release
flavors
that
i
didnt
like
in
the
beer
drinkability
finally
got
to
try
this
beer
about
what
i
expected
easy
to
drink
and
fairly
tasty
goes
down
very
easy
i
can
always
session
yuengling
i
was
amazed
to
see
this
in
my
fridge
my
roommate
is
in
the
national
guard
and
found
this
at
the
duty
free
shop
i
had
thought
it
impossible
to
find
in
ma
pours
a
medium
brown
color
very
bubbly
with
a
vanishing
but
healthy
head
this
beer
is
like
taking
a
bud
heavy
or
a
coors
or
a
mgd
and
saying
i
want
better
than
this
yuengling
is
a
traditional
american
fuck
yeah
lager
that
lives
up
to
its
colonial
roots
not
only
is
it
cheap
it
also
beats
every
stupid
macro
in
the
northern
us
and
want
to
drink
a
good
beer
that
you
can
only
find
in
the
south
yuengling
the
taste
is
hardy
and
the
drinkability
is
beyond
comparison
if
your
one
of
those
people
who
chooses
to
get
drunk
and
chooses
to
get
drunk
off
beer
screw
all
the
others
yuengling
is
your
go
to
fuckbuddy
drinkability
is
super
high
i
could
and
have
drank
these
all
day
just
enough
taste
to
satisfy
but
still
keep
it
highly
sessionable
the
benchmark
american
lager
in
my
opinion
also
one
of
the
only
beers
i
prefer
out
of
a
can
drinkability
okay
so
my
dear
friend
thadd
larue
who
never
steers
me
wrong
is
right
once
again
if
this
was
as
available
in
sf
as
pbr
i
would
never
touch
the
blue
ribbon
again
good
stuff
for
whatever
the
hell
style
you
want
to
call
it
cheers
d
this
is
a
rock
solid
brew
very
consistent
and
very
refreshing
noting
off
at
all
all
aspects
of
this
beer
are
above
par
it
does
lack
complexity
but
thats
not
quite
what
theyre
going
for
i
think
it
hits
its
target
and
deserves
credit
for
that
great
choice
among
macros
ill
have
another
d
always
smooth
and
refreshing
drinkability
this
is
an
old
standard
of
mine
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
doesnt
knock
your
socks
of
but
its
always
good
in
a
pinch
really
nice
on
a
summer
day
and
just
as
pleasant
in
a
bottle
as
it
is
on
draft
no
bar
or
party
should
be
without
it
its
easy
enough
for
the
masses
but
has
enough
taste
and
body
to
please
a
legit
beer
drinker
thin
watery
mouthfeel
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
and
it
was
better
than
i
though
it
would
be
personally
i
grew
up
with
yuengling
but
yet
again
who
has
not
in
the
last
15
years
around
greater
philly
i
admire
the
company
a
great
deal
and
their
commitment
to
the
local
beer
industry
and
the
town
of
pottsville
is
admirable
as
for
the
beer
like
anything
as
you
get
older
the
novelty
wears
and
taste
buds
grow
and
change
still
there
are
plenty
of
good
memories
associated
with
it
and
for
that
it
deserves
a
thumbs
up
an
american
classic
its
decent
doable
and
i
could
go
for
it
again
if
im
at
an
event
when
miller
lite
and
corona
are
the
other
only
options
this
was
the
beer
of
choice
at
the
wedding
rehersal
dinner
and
afterparty
i
attended
d
very
easy
to
drink
usually
my
go
to
when
the
only
other
options
are
bmc
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
very
slight
head
to
it
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
a
very
faint
hop
aroma
on
the
back
end
the
overall
taste
is
very
smooth
there
is
a
malt
presence
up
front
that
is
a
majority
of
the
beer
with
an
ever
so
slight
hop
backbone
mouthfeel
is
a
lower
carbonation
level
the
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
not
very
complex
but
nothing
to
run
from
not
my
absolute
favorite
but
one
of
the
best
valued
quality
lagers
available
just
because
i
think
nugget
nectar
and
dfh
squall
and
smuttynose
ipa
and
other
superb
craft
brews
are
among
the
best
brews
out
there
doesnt
take
away
one
iota
the
pleasure
i
get
from
the
unflappable
yuengling
lager
d
a
high
quality
brew
steeped
in
deep
tradition
a
legend
in
my
home
area
im
probably
a
bit
biased
as
its
my
first
beer
love
but
who
cares
if
these
rankings
arent
about
passion
what
else
are
they
based
upon
this
is
a
must
try
for
all
beer
lovers
one
of
the
original
greats
i
dont
really
see
what
so
many
people
seem
to
enjoy
about
yuengling
so
much
it
seems
to
be
a
beer
where
its
typical
drinkers
realize
that
bud
and
coors
are
garbage
but
they
arent
really
in
the
know
about
any
good
craft
breweries
while
it
certainly
does
deserve
respect
above
bud
and
coors
and
such
i
dont
find
it
to
be
that
much
better
really
its
quite
bland
overall
with
little
to
enjoy
sure
it
doesnt
just
taste
like
corn
adjunt
but
theres
not
much
malt
or
hop
to
the
flavor
either
i
suppose
its
the
type
of
thing
people
want
to
have
a
party
where
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
and
there
is
still
not
too
much
flavor
there
are
certainly
better
options
out
there
and
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
anyone
could
prefer
this
beer
over
any
other
but
again
it
is
still
better
than
being
stuck
with
bmc
i
guess
d
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
perfect
paired
with
food
and
can
consumed
in
quantity
very
nice
and
is
good
every
season
future
outlook
decent
unadventurous
beer
that
delivers
on
being
a
nicely
sessionable
beer
a
pa
beer
that
doesnt
get
distributed
here
so
i
dont
envision
buying
though
my
father
often
has
it
so
i
will
gladly
have
it
again
i
like
to
think
of
it
this
way
i
am
at
the
ball
game
and
i
get
a
choice
of
bud
coors
miller
or
yuengling
there
is
no
competition
i
go
with
yuengling
every
time
obviously
this
is
one
that
splits
the
obvious
youve
got
some
serious
yuengling
devotees
out
there
overall
i
think
its
a
solid
lager
substantially
better
than
bmc
but
not
even
close
to
the
quality
of
a
craft
ale
or
even
lager
for
that
matter
pour
is
fine
amber
color
with
a
ton
of
busy
bubbles
seen
through
the
crystal
clear
beer
small
slighty
offwhite
head
that
dissolves
quickly
nose
is
grainy
malt
some
sweet
corn
in
there
nothing
much
else
going
on
flavor
is
similar
corny
water
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
then
stronger
dirty
candy
malt
with
that
graininess
still
a
little
waterier
than
id
expect
gotta
rank
it
high
cause
i
do
seem
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
although
id
prefer
literally
any
craft
nonetheless
it
is
what
it
is
half
the
price
of
the
cheapest
craft
at
most
places
in
dc
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
since
alot
of
people
i
know
really
like
it
honestly
for
some
reason
it
reminds
me
of
like
a
rich
mans
pbr
its
not
a
horrible
beer
it
just
isnt
very
good
and
not
nearly
as
good
as
all
the
macro
drinkers
make
it
sound
the
taste
did
remind
me
of
pbr
some
i
dont
think
ill
drink
this
again
unless
its
free
pours
clear
amber
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
of
faint
amber
malt
and
that
strange
typical
adjunct
taste
without
much
else
to
report
the
taste
is
somehow
even
more
characterless
and
underwhelming
feel
is
light
and
fizzy
not
offensive
just
worthless
mon
tap
this
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
less
so
in
the
can
or
bottle
light
carbonation
we
say
that
in
the
coal
region
beer
is
like
water
and
this
is
usually
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
the
other
night
i
showed
up
an
hour
before
last
call
had
5
pints
and
left
wanting
more
of
the
same
overall
if
this
beer
is
readily
accessible
and
cheap
in
your
region
certainly
superior
to
most
comparable
beers
would
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
however
probably
not
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
well
its
better
than
the
aroma
would
imply
tastier
than
most
lagers
maltiness
balanced
with
the
hops
not
earth
shattering
but
a
nice
easy
session
lager
here
in
central
pa
we
order
these
just
by
saying
lager
the
bartender
knows
slight
reddish
tint
from
the
can
into
my
pint
glass
smelled
of
grain
but
not
of
the
nasty
corn
in
other
macros
taste
was
best
described
as
basic
mouthfeel
is
average
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
smoothness
and
tight
carbonation
a
good
goto
for
picnics
and
barbecues
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
lighter
beers
during
the
summer
i
always
get
some
when
i
travel
east
something
i
would
recommend
d
this
is
okay
i
tried
it
back
to
back
with
stegmaier
amber
lager
and
would
have
to
give
the
edge
to
stegmaier
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
very
malty
slightly
sweet
taste
is
of
malts
a
bit
sweet
and
lightly
hopped
pretty
tasty
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
but
i
dont
get
it
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
i
guess
that
i
am
happy
that
my
bmc
friends
drink
this
now
just
cause
their
money
is
going
a
small
brewery
and
not
one
of
those
microeating
conglomerates
it
is
very
drinkable
and
tastes
good
on
a
hot
day
d
one
of
the
best
beers
in
this
price
range
very
clean
very
crisp
but
not
overly
watered
down
and
light
body
leave
me
thinking
that
i
have
found
my
new
fall
back
beer
this
beer
i
could
drink
everyday
and
will
had
this
at
the
philly
airport
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
smelled
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
tasted
similar
with
caramel
tones
had
a
very
smooth
feel
finished
clean
overall
quite
a
drinkable
sessionable
beer
a
nice
lager
with
decent
flavor
much
better
than
many
macros
i
love
drinking
this
beer
when
i
have
the
chance
the
ultimate
session
beer
a
legend
taste
wise
it
doesnt
really
follow
through
either
its
refreshing
but
theres
something
not
quite
right
adjuncts
about
it
the
balance
between
hops
and
malt
is
more
on
the
malty
side
but
it
is
very
drinkable
having
said
all
that
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
not
too
carbonated
nice
local
offering
pours
an
amber
color
without
any
head
but
plenty
of
film
and
lacing
smells
of
pungent
thin
hollow
malt
and
hops
but
crisp
and
clean
nonetheless
there
is
nothing
impressive
about
the
smell
but
there
is
absolutely
no
fault
in
it
i
am
a
big
ale
drinker
and
i
have
no
idea
why
lagers
have
such
a
mass
appeal
when
ales
get
hardly
any
credit
but
i
digress
the
taste
is
thin
a
tiny
hint
of
malt
and
another
tiny
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
fine
its
just
very
thin
and
lacks
any
body
but
then
again
it
is
a
lager
drinkability
is
exceptional
because
there
is
no
real
fault
in
this
beer
clean
crisp
just
enough
taste
to
keep
me
going
not
a
bad
beer
yuengling
has
always
been
one
of
the
more
popular
offerings
at
my
campfires
and
for
good
reason
deasy
enough
to
drink
i
would
say
a
very
good
lawn
mowing
or
outdoor
summer
beer
taste
is
more
palatable
than
aroma
some
balancing
bitter
hops
some
not
too
vegetabley
bready
malt
to
it
but
basically
its
a
fairly
standard
lager
a
cut
above
the
normal
swill
and
satisfying
enough
but
nothing
memorable
id
certainly
over
it
above
quite
a
few
commonly
available
brews
but
not
ahead
of
just
about
any
decent
micro
i
can
think
of
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
decent
drinkability
great
macrobrew
easily
drinkable
with
good
balance
old
standby
drinkability
pretty
great
for
a
lager
if
only
this
were
available
in
ohio
overall
its
nothing
spectacular
at
all
but
its
still
perfectly
drinkable
sometimes
i
just
want
something
simple
to
recover
from
all
the
other
heavy
hefes
and
stouts
i
drink
any
other
day
md
mouthfeel
is
easy
on
the
buds
with
good
overall
drinkablity
best
of
the
american
lawn
mower
beers
keep
these
in
the
beer
fridge
in
the
garage
and
hit
them
on
hot
days
perfect
mouthfeel
for
a
lager
surprised
to
see
this
as
an
amber
i
doubt
i
would
seek
this
out
again
really
seems
to
be
bmc
in
disguise
i
like
a
good
craft
lager
but
this
is
too
close
to
macro
for
me
this
brew
pours
up
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
nose
is
dry
and
pale
malty
the
taste
is
pretty
basic
pale
malts
and
dry
with
low
hops
the
brew
is
not
too
dry
though
medium
to
light
bodied
subtle
carbo
pretty
easy
drinkin
its
not
about
the
money
clean
mouthfeel
and
awesome
drinkability
make
this
just
another
micro
that
is
really
a
macro
crisp
easy
drinking
mellow
lager
great
for
a
hot
afternoon
or
a
drinking
session
mouthfeel
is
very
well
done
crisp
efficient
light
supremely
refreshing
here
and
certainly
drinkable
d
an
easy
going
brew
that
tastes
pretty
good
and
is
really
affordable
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
my
new
goto
for
session
beers
md
a
rather
light
and
soft
beer
and
easy
to
drink
brew
probably
why
it
is
so
popular
d
great
to
have
as
a
regular
or
just
sessions
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
without
becoming
overwhelmed
with
the
taste
definitely
recommended
this
beer
was
born
out
of
the
american
spirit
of
drinking
we
took
what
the
germans
knew
about
beer
and
made
it
better
it
may
have
not
won
any
awards
but
this
beer
is
great
in
fact
this
is
my
favorite
beer
most
german
beers
give
off
a
bitter
taste
the
taste
of
this
beer
reminds
me
of
marijuana
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
bottom
line
ive
never
met
anyone
that
didnt
think
yuengling
was
at
least
decent
its
an
old
standby
pours
from
the
32oz
bottle
an
attractive
copper
color
with
a
foamy
onefinger
head
that
quickly
disappeared
into
a
modest
collar
surprisingly
little
carbonation
hardly
any
bubbles
the
aroma
is
light
subded
a
trace
of
malt
no
detectable
hops
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
toast
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
your
average
macro
lager
high
marks
for
drinkability
it
goes
down
light
crisp
smooth
overall
a
cut
above
the
standard
macro
lager
but
not
quite
craft
worthy
had
this
on
tap
at
blarneys
in
philly
for
1
never
reviewed
it
before
so
seems
like
the
time
poured
a
golden
same
color
of
wheat
with
a
thick
white
head
good
retention
on
the
head
smell
was
grainy
with
light
hops
taste
was
similar
not
too
complex
not
as
light
as
i
was
expecting
with
some
real
flavor
and
a
nice
hop
balance
in
the
finish
good
session
beer
overall
its
a
nice
beer
for
the
price
if
im
at
a
bar
with
a
limited
selection
ill
usually
go
for
a
yuengling
as
its
a
solid
beer
that
seems
to
taste
well
no
matter
where
i
have
it
where
i
live
i
get
a
case
for
around
18
cant
beat
that
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
to
make
a
regular
and
as
sessionable
as
it
gets
drinkability
this
is
a
reasonably
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
with
its
low
abv
it
would
be
fine
for
an
afternoon
bbq
or
an
evening
on
the
beach
its
price
wont
break
the
bank
if
you
want
to
fill
a
cooler
for
a
party
drinkability
highly
drinkable
enjoyable
session
beer
amazing
choice
for
the
summertime
and
a
hot
nite
you
drink
them
and
never
ever
have
a
problem
having
hard
time
for
another
time
for
another
so
much
better
then
your
average
american
macro
lager
and
when
you
throw
in
just
how
good
the
price
is
this
is
a
must
buy
for
any
average
man
i
spent
13
99
for
24
pack
a
classic
for
me
now
and
i
look
forward
to
this
summer
of
enjoying
my
new
find
the
saving
grace
of
the
beer
is
that
its
a
tasty
little
session
beer
that
wont
drain
your
pocket
although
you
shouldnt
expect
greatness
this
beer
is
much
more
flavorful
than
the
standard
industrial
beers
and
may
cost
less
i
can
and
have
drank
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
row
with
an
abv
that
low
its
a
great
session
beer
d
very
drinkable
and
often
the
best
option
in
the
many
craftdesert
bars
in
fl
the
malt
character
is
light
but
much
more
robust
than
its
competition
and
makes
for
a
very
sessionable
beer
high
drinkability
this
is
cheap
and
better
than
other
american
macros
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
or
lacing
smell
is
generally
corn
and
grains
with
taste
is
relatively
similar
in
that
there
is
some
corn
and
grain
characteristics
with
a
slight
malt
backbone
little
bit
low
on
taste
but
not
too
bad
moderate
carbonation
good
drinkability
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
the
best
considering
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
a
little
light
on
flavor
but
drinkable
and
enjoyable
in
a
pinch
this
will
more
than
do
very
clean
body
very
refreshing
i
can
see
why
this
is
considered
a
classic
12
ounce
bottle
one
of
my
friends
from
work
was
nice
enough
to
get
me
a
case
of
this
on
a
recent
trip
to
pa
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
smells
like
sweet
malt
grain
and
some
bread
no
offensive
aromas
at
all
its
a
nice
smelling
traditional
american
lager
aroma
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
its
sweet
and
malty
it
tastes
like
sweet
malt
breadgrain
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
mouthfeelbody
is
light
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
i
admit
that
i
havent
had
this
in
a
couple
years
but
its
as
good
as
i
remember
its
a
good
solid
lager
if
it
was
available
in
ohio
id
pick
it
up
quite
a
bit
for
the
style
its
a
pretty
good
beer
much
better
than
the
typical
bmc
american
lagers
d
im
torn
in
a
couple
of
different
directions
here
as
an
amber
lager
its
unabashedly
a
macro
corny
slightly
metallic
and
sweet
however
as
a
cheap
nofrills
macro
this
is
at
or
near
the
head
of
the
pack
quite
quaffable
and
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
12
ounce
can
poured
into
my
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
slightly
hazed
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
light
ecru
colored
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
bready
biscuity
malts
grassy
hops
sweet
corn
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
it
is
what
it
is
a
super
easy
to
drink
accessible
quenching
amber
lager
d
this
beer
is
easy
sipping
not
too
heavy
nor
too
light
on
flavor
a
straightforward
brew
without
any
complexity
the
best
macro
ive
had
by
far
d
very
high
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
very
basic
but
it
does
it
right
i
could
drink
a
million
goes
down
smooth
d
this
is
pretty
much
my
beer
of
last
resort
meaning
that
its
as
low
as
ill
go
as
far
as
beers
ill
willingly
pay
for
its
not
going
out
of
your
way
for
by
any
means
but
if
youre
in
a
typical
bar
on
the
eastern
seaboard
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
a
nice
cheap
beer
for
your
outoftown
friends
to
enjoy
of
all
of
the
macros
the
big
y
never
fails
to
please
and
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
4
4
avb
you
can
drink
these
like
water
dcompliments
and
doesnt
overpower
the
food
your
eating
it
with
i
think
if
this
were
available
i
would
probably
pick
some
up
for
a
hot
day
bbq
i
am
glad
to
see
that
this
lager
has
a
body
to
it
thanks
to
tia
for
grabbing
this
a
great
american
beer
the
oldest
brewery
in
america
and
its
safe
to
say
its
safe
to
say
a
really
great
beer
for
its
traditional
lager
has
a
really
good
mouthfeel
not
abrasive
at
all
feels
good
going
down
and
it
highly
drinkable
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
the
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
lack
of
offensive
or
any
flavors
this
beer
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
the
pour
was
a
surprising
amber
i
think
i
expected
a
pale
yellow
so
i
was
quite
happy
with
the
tone
as
well
as
the
foamy
beige
head
the
smell
has
elements
of
vague
hops
and
bread
medium
mouthfeel
the
taste
has
some
distant
hops
and
a
little
grainy
and
sweet
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
i
wish
it
was
available
in
my
state
d
this
is
the
highest
part
of
this
definately
co9uld
have
a
few
of
these
and
have
in
the
past
d
you
will
wonder
where
it
has
all
gone
off
to
overall
a
step
up
from
the
macroalternative
widely
available
in
pa
on
tap
and
in
bottles
it
is
nice
to
know
there
is
a
safety
net
walking
into
an
unknown
bar
if
no
other
crafts
are
around
yuengling
always
serves
as
the
security
blanket
however
in
a
good
beer
bar
yuengling
is
always
the
brides
maid
never
the
bride
before
expanding
my
palate
yuengling
used
to
be
my
favorite
beer
i
gre
up
in
the
dc
area
so
we
had
plenty
of
it
around
i
still
consider
this
a
great
beer
for
a
night
full
of
drinking
but
not
one
that
i
would
drink
because
i
want
to
enjoy
a
beer
i
still
love
you
yuengling
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
you
again
stupid
yuengling
doesnt
ship
to
ca
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
a
very
very
easydrinking
beer
one
of
my
personal
favorites
it
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
although
not
an
outofthisworld
brew
therell
always
be
a
spot
in
my
fridge
for
a
lager
notes
i
dont
really
ever
see
myself
drinking
one
of
these
beers
again
unless
it
is
free
or
it
is
the
only
beer
around
and
im
at
a
party
i
say
this
because
this
beer
just
doesnt
really
do
anything
for
me
it
doesnt
refresh
like
a
good
wheat
beer
or
belgian
does
and
it
doesnt
have
the
flavor
that
a
good
stout
does
a
disappointment
pours
a
clear
light
orangeamber
almost
golden
thin
white
head
forms
drops
to
a
thin
ring
no
real
lacing
on
the
glass
looks
average
smell
is
nice
toasty
malt
light
caramel
lightly
fruity
like
apricot
biscuits
nicely
malty
some
light
hoppiness
taste
is
similar
toasty
malt
some
caramel
light
fruit
grains
very
full
flavoured
lightly
bitter
in
the
finish
but
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
solid
lager
id
drink
this
watching
the
game
if
i
had
access
to
it
yuengling
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
it
has
a
solid
taste
and
is
great
served
cold
i
enjoyed
it
from
the
12
oz
can
but
prefer
it
after
pouring
it
into
a
tall
glass
my
favorite
quality
of
this
beer
is
its
excellent
taste
and
drinkability
balance
this
is
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
good
solid
drinkablity
i
have
filled
lots
of
recycle
bins
with
bottles
of
lager
very
good
solid
beer
nothing
incredible
but
to
me
lagers
arent
my
favorite
but
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
lager
this
is
a
great
representative
drinkability
very
easy
but
horrible
dirty
aftertaste
beer
than
a
bud
but
not
better
than
much
other
d
the
fact
that
this
was
not
as
good
from
a
green
bottle
as
it
was
from
a
tap
was
no
shocker
still
this
is
a
great
tasting
cheap
no
frills
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
were
it
available
in
my
part
of
the
country
overall
you
can
see
yourself
driking
a
lot
of
these
and
i
have
a
simple
cheap
beer
that
is
a
thousand
times
better
then
the
price
suggests
why
drink
a
big
3
again
drink
enjoy
repeat
ive
had
one
at
every
establishment
ive
ventured
into
here
in
fort
myers
beach
i
look
forward
to
more
this
beer
is
very
good
for
the
price
miller
lite
was
the
same
price
for
a
12
pack
which
was
9
99
why
buy
a
cheap
crud
beer
like
miller
lite
for
9
99
when
yuengling
is
a
few
steps
above
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
short
white
head
no
lacing
the
smell
is
not
muchyeast
some
sourness
taste
is
grainy
some
sweet
malts
earthy
sour
yeast
mouthfeel
is
crisp
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
lager
its
a
much
better
option
than
the
adjuct
lager
macros
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
what
it
is
no
one
is
going
to
call
you
out
for
drinking
yuengling
but
its
not
what
youd
bring
out
to
impress
anyone
either
yuengling
is
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
it
is
not
my
first
choice
but
i
do
not
turn
it
down
it
brings
back
good
memories
of
college
where
my
friends
and
i
would
drive
from
wv
to
pa
to
pick
up
a
case
or
two
d
much
much
better
than
the
american
lagers
put
out
by
bmc
and
a
nice
beer
to
sit
back
with
if
youre
going
to
have
more
than
a
few
or
simply
want
to
sit
back
lazily
with
something
comfortable
d
effortless
to
drink
great
balance
for
a
session
beer
and
would
be
perfect
with
a
meal
i
have
five
more
of
these
gems
raymond
you
have
betrayed
me
after
much
anticipation
to
try
a
yuengling
i
found
it
to
be
average
at
best
maybe
itll
grow
on
me
purchased
six
pack
for
6
79
at
bp
on
wilma
rudolph
blvd
in
clarksville
tn
where
the
beer
selection
was
quite
good
for
a
gas
mart
with
new
belgium
fat
fire
michelob
dunkelweisse
and
hoegaarden
among
the
macros
in
the
cooler
there
was
even
yuenglings
black
tan
maybe
ill
try
that
next
pour
into
my
sam
adams
sensory
glass
created
a
nice
foamy
head
and
thousands
of
tiny
beer
bubbles
in
my
glass
smell
was
not
distinguishable
really
just
couldnt
get
a
read
on
this
beer
by
smell
though
i
found
the
beer
to
have
a
clean
crisp
taste
mouthful
was
decent
and
low
abv
makes
the
drinkability
better
than
average
still
the
jury
might
be
out
on
this
american
made
brew
i
think
ill
have
another
mouthfeeldrinkability
after
a
brief
sizzle
on
the
tongue
the
texture
thins
out
completely
and
goes
down
like
water
this
not
only
diminishes
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
sip
but
it
further
brings
out
the
lessthan
average
components
of
the
beer
itself
aside
from
slugging
a
real
cold
one
from
the
bottle
on
a
hot
summer
day
id
suggest
passing
on
this
one
completely
i
had
better
expectations
for
it
if
youve
got
the
opportunity
to
try
a
traditional
lager
i
highly
recommend
you
do
so
it
looks
a
nice
dark
amber
color
and
i
have
gotten
different
results
with
the
foam
when
pouring
it
differently
but
when
done
right
it
seems
to
stay
nicely
there
is
a
strong
hoppyness
to
me
feels
good
when
drinking
when
i
first
had
this
a
few
years
ago
and
i
saw
how
cheap
it
was
here
i
thought
it
would
be
another
cheap
beer
but
not
grainyness
at
all
smooth
fyi
buy
this
beer
in
a
can
over
a
bottle
notes
first
taste
of
this
brewery
yuengling
is
not
available
in
michigan
and
yet
many
people
ask
if
we
carry
it
i
dont
get
the
hype
there
are
plenty
of
subs
i
guess
its
just
a
cult
thing
where
someone
will
get
to
brag
to
his
friends
for
a
week
that
he
brought
a
case
back
from
some
other
state
like
hes
bootlegging
yuenglings
or
something
at
4
40
abv
of
course
extremely
drinkable
i
could
slump
over
a
scarred
up
old
bar
drink
these
all
night
doggone
decent
beer
for
2
95
a
pour
drinkability
very
basic
and
simple
cheap
cheap
cheap
better
choice
than
bud
or
coors
at
a
bar
d
ive
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
now
and
i
can
say
now
that
i
see
why
it
is
a
cult
beer
its
not
really
that
good
but
better
than
the
bmcs
around
the
same
price
and
has
local
appeal
that
being
said
its
just
not
a
very
impressive
beer
it
does
do
some
things
right
i
love
how
some
ambers
pick
up
anise
notes
but
does
so
many
things
wrong
body
finish
lack
of
flavor
honestly
id
rather
have
the
new
schlitz
surprisingly
good
beer
drinkability
is
exceptional
the
very
textbook
definition
of
a
session
beer
for
me
they
fix
that
smell
and
this
could
stand
up
above
its
regional
macro
reputation
just
to
toss
in
my
two
cents
on
this
one
this
has
become
my
new
cheap
beer
i
do
like
it
and
the
price
is
good
and
available
pretty
much
everywhere
in
the
south
originally
from
michigan
where
it
didnt
exist
pretty
standard
middle
of
the
road
lager
easy
to
drink
easy
on
the
wallet
not
a
bad
choice
when
you
dont
want
to
spend
a
fortune
on
beer
but
want
to
at
least
be
a
step
above
some
of
the
more
traditional
big
breweries
d
a
good
fallback
beer
i
bring
this
as
a
postgame
beer
for
hockey
nights
its
better
than
the
molson
that
others
show
up
with
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
2
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
metallic
and
grassy
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
little
hoppy
bitterness
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
made
for
quaffing
a
long
time
favorite
and
a
great
session
beer
excellent
drinkability
i
see
yuengling
as
a
very
versatile
beer
its
always
a
pleasant
surprise
to
find
this
beer
at
a
party
as
opposed
to
usual
macros
like
bud
and
miller
being
from
pa
too
yuengling
often
brings
a
sense
of
pride
and
i
love
seeing
it
when
i
go
other
places
however
as
my
palate
has
expanded
i
must
say
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
many
of
the
greater
beers
i
have
experienced
nonetheless
yuengling
will
always
be
one
of
favorites
and
reliable
fyi
living
in
southeastern
pa
if
you
ask
for
lager
at
any
local
bar
this
is
what
they
give
you
i
heard
a
lot
of
rave
reviews
about
this
beer
but
simply
put
i
was
very
disappointed
the
beer
looks
good
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
nice
amber
glow
and
a
good
foamy
head
but
thats
were
the
good
ends
imo
the
beer
just
lacks
any
real
flavor
and
tastes
very
watered
down
clean
and
refreshing
is
what
you
are
gonna
get
with
this
beer
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
i
am
looking
for
something
light
a
great
session
beer
that
doesnt
get
offensive
with
a
lot
of
foods
the
taste
is
on
the
sweeter
side
and
the
hop
flavor
is
subdued
i
prefer
it
on
draft
but
it
is
decent
from
the
bottle
too
overall
ive
never
been
fond
of
yuenling
lager
the
porter
is
okay
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
black
and
tan
but
the
lager
is
something
i
really
have
to
choke
down
you
basically
get
what
you
pay
for
with
this
beer
i
would
say
that
its
far
better
than
budweiser
miller
coors
etc
this
beer
pours
a
vey
clear
amber
with
a
light
white
head
the
snell
is
feint
but
you
get
some
malt
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
nice
and
smooth
not
overpowering
by
any
means
no
bad
aftertastes
like
other
lagers
and
a
slight
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
seems
nice
and
the
carbonation
level
may
be
a
little
low
a
highly
drinkable
brew
with
no
bad
aftertaste
d
nothing
beats
slugging
a
few
of
these
after
some
hard
work
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
otherwise
one
or
2
is
plenty
again
if
you
want
to
rid
yourself
of
the
bmc
fare
yuengling
is
really
for
you
update
this
one
has
grown
on
me
in
some
respects
still
nothing
great
here
but
compared
to
your
other
common
macro
brews
this
one
is
a
step
ahead
it
has
become
my
go
to
beer
when
im
on
a
budget
and
the
bar
special
is
something
like
dollar
domestics
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
although
im
rarely
in
the
mood
for
this
style
of
lager
clearly
better
than
bmc
d
compared
to
those
other
beers
this
is
the
one
that
im
always
coming
back
to
sure
glad
im
from
pa
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
to
kick
back
with
if
you
arent
looking
to
spend
much
and
just
want
a
basic
lager
it
fits
the
mold
of
the
the
american
macros
but
its
a
step
above
the
others
like
coors
bud
and
miller
if
youre
drinking
american
macro
lager
drink
this
instead
ok
as
an
eastern
pennsylvanian
i
am
biased
in
favor
of
this
beer
but
it
has
a
great
amber
color
excellent
drink
ability
and
the
flavor
is
home
to
me
it
is
simply
the
best
utility
beer
on
the
market
sure
it
wont
win
many
contests
but
i
love
it
crisp
refreshing
lightmedium
in
body
wellcarbonated
and
highly
drinkable
a
good
alternative
to
bmc
if
cans
are
your
thing
there
are
much
worse
beers
out
there
and
this
is
actually
fairly
drinkable
d
very
light
beer
the
power
of
yuengling
is
that
it
is
easy
drinking
and
can
be
used
when
you
want
to
stretch
out
the
session
with
minimal
impact
d
holy
hell
yea

pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
white
heading
smells
of
caramel
mostly
and
very
dank
hops
excellent
carbonation
and
almost
no
lacing
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
isnt
too
gassy
to
me
the
best
american
lager
ive
tasted
and
really
does
own
the
name
lager
another
thing
if
you
can
try
this
on
tap
it
just
seems
to
be
much
different
in
a
keg
rather
than
bottled
drinkability
not
too
shabby
for
a
micro
would
try
again
when
out
east
and
the
only
choices
are
macros
good
for
a
chilling
time
beer
or
a
party
standard
of
course
id
rather
have
a
samuel
smith
taddy
porter
or
a
nut
brown
instead
as
a
chilling
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
in
the
glass
little
head
that
disappears
quickly
no
lace
good
carbonation
and
a
tad
more
hops
than
youd
expect
from
an
american
lager
at
this
price
has
a
nice
bite
at
about
a
buck
more
a
six
pack
than
the
big
three
corn
and
rice
brewers
its
well
worth
looking
for
actually
its
now
in
a
lot
of
supermarkets
appearance
a
golden
yellow
with
amber
tinting
the
nose
is
sweet
malt
a
hint
of
yeast
and
hops
the
taste
is
slightly
malty
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
notes
of
yeast
the
finish
is
clean
and
quick
with
a
simple
mouthfeel
a
good
beer
to
drink
while
watching
the
game
d
a
low
abv
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
makes
yuengling
very
drinkable
i
could
put
back
quite
a
few
of
these
at
a
bar
or
gathering
with
ease
but
the
taste
gets
old
after
a
few
a
great
summertime
beer
with
some
bbq
and
friends
a
great
choice
if
you
need
to
bring
a
case
to
a
party
because
everybody
seems
to
recognize
and
love
it
drinkability
way
to
good
in
this
catagory
once
you
drink
one
it
easly
turns
into
a
half
of
case
or
more
yet
another
beer
that
i
have
to
rate
off
the
tap
to
get
by
the
stinky
green
bottle
nasty
notes
from
aug2008
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
aromas
of
caramel
malt
faint
hops
and
apple
cider
taste
is
like
caramel
apple
cider
not
sure
how
to
better
describe
it
somewhat
buttery
mouthfeel
hops
are
in
wanting
good
clean
and
sweet
finish
my
pick
out
of
the
macro
american
lagers
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
brown
a
resemblance
of
a
much
more
expensive
beer
aroma
is
very
malty
with
little
hops
and
a
slight
sweetness
the
head
is
decentaverage
but
not
much
lacing
on
the
glass
tastes
of
your
average
lager
with
a
subtle
sweetness
at
the
end
very
refreshing
if
you
ask
me
extremely
drinkable
especially
for
the
price
about
9
for
a
12
pack
where
i
live
my
choice
for
a
quantity
above
quality
beer
d
very
drinkable
for
an
fairly
light
american
lager
with
some
flavor
a
solid
choice
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
its
drinkability
it
is
not
too
complex
but
it
is
good
with
a
barbeque
and
easy
to
drink
the
best
macro
lager
for
the
price
you
cant
beat
it
it
has
more
flavor
and
body
than
the
other
macros
because
of
the
price
and
its
quality
i
give
it
a
high
rating
note
fresh
in
bottle
its
better
quite
malty
and
balanced
well
a
very
sessionable
beer

typical
american
macro
lager
with
a
tiny
bit
more
taste
color
and
aroma
than
the
big
boys
pours
dark
golden
with
a
head
that
fades
immediately
the
smell
is
light
and
tangy
with
lager
yeast
and
smells
of
adjuncts
extremely
light
and
even
a
bit
washedout
tasting
slightlt
sweet
and
corny
smooth
enough
and
about
as
easy
to
drink
as
water
with
the
same
interest
level
a
pretty
decent
beer
especially
for
the
price
and
in
comparison
to
the
bmc
competition
great
session
beer
or
party
beer
when
you
still
want
to
taste
something
good
ive
had
this
a
good
amount
so
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
but
its
an
american
classic
drinkability
is
fairly
high
its
not
a
super
impressive
beer
but
it
is
certainly
sessionable
and
not
as
offensive
as
the
big
3
imo
drinkability
while
the
flavor
isnt
the
best
its
far
from
overwhelming
in
either
direction
plus
the
beer
is
pretty
refreshing
i
think
this
is
where
yuengling
really
shines
would
i
want
to
drink
this
every
day
no
but
its
fine
for
what
it
is
a
decent
alternative
to
one
of
the
big
three
d
a
great
beer
for
washing
the
car
cutting
grass
etc
very
light
and
tasty
better
than
the
other
stuff
on
the
market
bud
coors
and
miller
for
the
price
but
beware
do
not
pour
into
a
glass
i
dont
know
what
chemistry
affects
the
beer
from
the
bottle
to
the
glass
but
it
spoils
the
beer
i
would
drink
it
from
the
bottle
but
i
havent
had
it
on
tap
poured
a
1
head
of
white
foam
that
quickly
broke
down
to
a
thin
layer
appearance
was
a
light
brownred
color
and
clear
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
and
crisp
with
carbonation
ive
really
enjoyed
the
amberred
microbrews
that
i
tried
and
yuengling
is
not
as
deeply
flavorful
as
those
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
bottle
12
oz
pours
a
deep
golden
brown
with
very
few
bubbles
and
not
a
lot
of
head
looks
like
a
beer
and
not
apple
juice
like
many
other
lagers
very
faint
malty
aroma
with
an
even
fainter
hint
of
fruit
smooth
tasting
with
little
aftertaste
not
very
bitter
definitely
tastes
like
a
beer
nice
smooth
finish
on
the
whole
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
not
too
overpowering
in
taste
aroma
or
carbonation
makes
for
smooth
drinking
doubly
good
for
coming
out
of
a
green
bottle
most
other
green
bottled
beers
are
very
iffy
but
not
this
one
this
is
a
great
session
lager
its
cheap
and
it
tastes
good
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
fine
balanced
sessionable
lager
that
fares
better
than
most
macro
lagers
available
like
a
basic
lager
deluxe
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
my
travels
away
from
new
england
as
they
do
not
distribute
up
here
45
a
case
more
then
the
cans
thats
a
box
of
apple
jacks
right
there
i
drink
this
beer
regularly
when
i
go
out
and
watch
the
ufc
pay
per
view
events
its
about
the
only
non
bmc
brew
offered
on
tap
its
easy
to
drink
and
a
pretty
good
thirst
quencher
goes
well
with
the
honey
mustard
wings
i
was
very
happy
to
find
this
beer
at
the
orlando
airport
while
waiting
for
my
plane
review
from
notes
unfortunately
the
happiness
didnt
last
long
as
i
took
my
first
sniff
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
and
no
lacing
in
the
pint
glass
aroma
of
skunk
and
some
sweet
caramel
malts
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
some
skunkiness
some
toasty
malts
and
a
bit
of
caramel
slightly
sweet
and
a
dry
crisp
finish
i
could
see
this
beer
being
pretty
good
if
it
were
super
fresh
but
the
green
bottles
might
have
done
this
one
in
quicker
than
normal
watery
and
lightbodied
honestly
i
dont
know
what
the
fuss
is
all
about
and
cant
see
why
east
coast
folks
wish
it
were
around
here
when
they
can
get
much
better
brews
from
americas
second
oldest
brewery
here
in
the
midwest
august
schells
reigns
supreme
in
that
contest
i
would
definitely
take
yuenglings
own
lord
chesterfiedl
over
this
anyway
as
i
find
it
both
more
easily
drinkable
and
also
more
flavourful
and
interesting
delighted
that
georgia
has
been
added
to
yuengling
area
of
distribution
always
been
a
fan
of
yuengling
and
will
continue
to
be
i
cant
rate
it
as
good
as
most
micorbrews
that
i
have
had
but
this
is
the
eiptomy
for
bmc
drinkers
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
is
a
bit
to
light
on
the
palate
for
my
liking
too
watery
the
beer
is
light
in
body
and
is
an
easy
drinker
but
why
would
you
want
to
pay
for
this
well
probably
because
youre
one
of
the
millions
of
people
that
are
tired
of
bmc
and
are
looking
for
a
better
beer
this
beer
is
just
as
flavorless
as
bud
except
for
the
fact
that
its
a
different
color
sure
theres
more
flavor
than
in
bud
but
i
dont
think
that
you
could
possibly
brew
anything
in
this
style
that
had
less
flavor
if
youre
looking
to
step
up
from
bud
to
a
beer
that
has
a
bit
more
flavor
but
is
still
flavorless
then
this
is
for
you
bud
drinkers
like
this
because
it
makes
them
feel
high
class
theyre
drinking
something
that
actually
has
color
albeit
only
a
few
shades
darker
than
bud
itself
and
has
a
slightly
different
but
equally
bland
taste
as
bud
fucking
rediculous
oh
ive
heard
about
this
so
lets
give
it
a
try
golden
brown
color
body
very
bubbly
no
head
lagery
malty
aroma
and
nutiness
somewhat
nutty
refreshing
not
too
shabby
now
i
can
see
what
the
talk
is
about
d
great
i
want
more
an
easy
drinker
that
is
a
great
session
beer
a
nice
offering
from
the
oldest
continuously
operating
brewery
in
the
united
states
and
one
thats
familyrun
to
boot
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
great
though
pretty
cheap
easy
to
find
beer
in
the
dc
area
i
find
this
to
be
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
am
by
no
means
a
huge
lager
fan
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
the
taste
is
quite
watery
tastes
much
like
the
smell
weak
but
very
drinkable
probably
the
best
beer
for
the
money
in
my
opinion
6
or
less
will
usually
get
me
a
six
pack
great
pour
rich
full
bodied
flavor
a
bit
of
an
after
taste
and
malty
flavor
that
im
not
too
fond
of
but
for
the
price
it
is
by
far
the
best
beer
out
there
drinkability
one
of
the
best
macros
in
america
no
doubt
d
good
drinkability
the
light
version
has
better
drinkability
obviously
this
pours
a
light
amber
color
nothing
special
in
the
appearance
the
head
does
not
last
long
the
taste
is
ok
but
does
have
a
slight
cold
medicine
taste
to
it
but
compared
to
other
macro
beers
out
there
that
cost
the
same
this
at
least
has
taste
this
is
a
nothing
special
beer
that
is
affordable
i
would
drink
it
again
but
only
as
an
alternative
to
other
macros
what
a
great
value
more
body
than
most
in
its
class
unfortunately
they
dont
sell
it
in
ohio
so
its
only
on
rare
occasion
that
i
get
to
have
this
treat
nice
darker
color
but
this
beer
as
great
as
it
is
is
focused
more
on
taste
than
looks
i
keep
this
one
in
the
canbottle
but
enjoy
every
last
drop
i
just
bought
a
24
pack
of
this
for
18
at
the
distributer
just
down
the
road
and
i
have
to
say
i
am
happy
with
it
the
price
is
a
little
high
but
after
living
in
maine
where
beer
is
cheaper
i
will
get
over
it
the
appearance
is
normal
for
a
traditional
lager
the
smell
is
the
only
weakness
for
this
beer
i
suppose
it
is
due
to
the
can
the
taste
is
surprisingly
good
i
always
used
to
think
yuengling
was
strong
but
this
was
pleasant
with
out
a
ton
of
carbonation
i
recommend
trying
this
to
others
however
i
am
still
trying
to
find
my
beer
and
so
far
nothing
has
beaten
molson
canadian
so
i
will
keep
searching
easy
drinking
good
for
what
it
is
better
than
most
macros
but
not
very
worth
seeking
out
unless
only
bmc
is
around
pours
a
perfectly
clear
light
ambercopper
color
with
about
a
half
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
is
fairly
clean
some
soft
grain
a
tad
earthy
and
mere
hints
of
sulfur
taste
is
pretty
good
there
is
a
subdued
malty
sweetness
a
solid
though
not
overwhelming
bitterness
some
very
light
hoppiness
and
an
omnipresent
mineral
every
so
slightly
metallic
flavor
good
mouthfeel
lightmedium
body
with
tingly
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
fairly
simple
and
straightforward
amber
lager
but
its
unpretentious
quaffable
and
enjoyable
notes
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
but
it
is
a
fine
brew
this
isnt
usually
available
in
my
area
but
my
uncle
brought
some
u
for
a
party
nothing
too
special
about
it
but
i
would
rather
have
this
over
any
of
the
other
big
beer
companies
offerings
good
taste
all
the
way
though
with
a
nice
body
and
mouthfeel
would
like
to
try
this
again
although
a
tad
low
in
abv
though
d
very
drinkable
and
beats
the
big
boys
in
that
price
point
but
still
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
i
enjoy
this
beer
anytime
i
can
these
go
down
like
water
after
a
workout
much
better
than
any
other
macro
lager
enjoy
if
its
available
where
you
are
its
a
surefire
bet
to
bring
to
a
party
or
to
work
through
during
a
weekend
choose
it
over
bmc
you
wont
be
disappointed
drinkability
due
to
its
crisp
mouth
feel
and
the
fact
that
its
on
the
lighter
side
id
say
this
is
its
best
feature
i
can
probably
go
through
a
6pack
of
these
if
i
wanted
to
as
others
have
said
if
i
lived
on
the
east
coast
i
cant
see
ever
picking
up
any
bmc
when
this
is
on
the
shelf
next
to
it
pleasure
to
get
to
try
this
d
this
a
good
cheap
beer
thats
readily
available
anywhere
that
sells
beer
in
pennsylvania
this
the
staple
of
my
weekends
and
i
dont
know
why
people
would
consider
the
big
macrolagers
when
this
sits
right
next
to
them
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
for
it
and
was
honestly
a
little
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
given
the
choice
between
this
and
the
typical
american
macro
brews
id
take
this
one
first
any
day
i
had
several
of
these
last
night
without
noticing
much
difference
but
tonight
i
am
having
another
to
compare
against
my
frequent
visits
with
yuengling
in
both
the
bottle
and
on
tap
hands
down
the
canned
version
is
the
best
it
doesnt
suffer
the
lack
of
carbonation
from
the
tap
lines
and
i
suppose
the
other
differences
deal
with
this
version
not
being
light
stuck
at
all
its
much
creamier
sweeter
and
devoid
of
the
sometimespleasantbutsometimesannoying
earthy
character
that
has
defined
yuengling
for
me
for
so
long
d
its
a
decent
drinkable
lager
for
a
session
style
of
beer
low
abv
and
light
body
make
it
a
good
beer
for
an
all
day
binge
in
the
summertime
overall
not
a
bad
mass
produced
beer
a
fall
back
is
somewhere
you
are
has
nothing
else
pours
a
clear
amber
with
an
ample
amount
of
carbonation
the
white
head
doesnt
linger
for
very
long
some
oxidation
in
the
aroma
smells
like
wet
cardboard
medium
in
body
with
a
seltzerlike
carbonation
taste
seems
a
little
off
it
has
a
malty
seltzer
quality
to
it
cardboard
that
i
detected
in
the
nose
returns
and
theres
a
slight
buttery
note
toward
the
back
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
of
this
it
was
was
either
yuengling
or
coors
light
at
the
restaurant
last
night
so
i
opted
for
the
yuengling
ive
had
it
before
in
bottles
and
liked
it
this
was
way
different
the
color
seemed
right
the
carbonation
seeemed
a
little
overdone
but
something
happened
to
the
taste
the
first
sip
had
nothing
to
it
very
bland
so
i
took
a
whiff
and
whoa
my
beer
has
no
smell
very
little
hops
smell
no
malt
or
anything
else
i
dont
know
if
the
restaurant
speers
street
grill
in
speers
pahad
a
problem
with
their
draft
equipment
but
this
was
ridiculous
my
water
and
lemon
had
more
flavor
finally
tried
this
a
few
times
while
in
pittsburgh
caramelbrown
in
appearance
semisweet
caramel
smell
and
taste
with
a
lot
more
flavor
than
most
of
the
massproduced
beers
on
tap
alongside
it
at
the
bar
i
was
at
not
strong
at
all
and
drinkable
enough
d
better
than
average
tasting
beer
at
a
good
price
great
for
gatherings
of
4
or
more
people
where
a
constant
rate
of
intake
would
be
common
d4
0
a
solid
lager
indeed
for
a
old
time
macro
has
body
and
malt
but
somewhat
watery
as
compared
to
most
microbrews
could
drink
this
all
day
the
fall
back
beer
usually
can
be
got
on
domestic
prices
round
here
so
thats
pretty
cool
has
a
macroesque
high
carbonation
feel
to
it
does
have
some
discernable
hop
presence
in
the
flavor
this
combines
with
bready
malts
to
create
something
resembling
balance
all
in
all
not
too
shabby
i
can
see
why
they
sell
alot
of
this
in
floridas
tropical
climate
fairly
refreshing
and
has
more
flavor
than
most
of
the
bmc
offerings
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
if
you
dont
care
much
for
taste
it
goes
down
easily
and
isnt
reprehensible
its
a
party
beer
thats
better
than
bud
light
although
thick
it
tastes
good
and
goes
down
smooth
and
clean
definitely
could
session
on
the
porch
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
would
consider
this
a
very
good
macro
brew
i
bought
it
because
it
was
the
only
thing
available
at
a
gas
station
that
was
still
open
but
it
could
have
been
much
worse
this
a
subpar
beer
at
best
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
cheap
tasty
and
low
abv
fantastic
session
beer
this
has
started
to
become
my
inexpensive
go
to
beer
and
ive
been
drinking
it
quite
a
bit
lately
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
for
the
price
its
not
going
to
overpower
with
flavor
or
anything
but
its
solid
sweet
with
some
caramel
malt
some
earthy
hops
some
grain
notes
and
sure
yeah
a
little
watery
thin
theres
a
lot
more
flavor
than
your
standard
swill
lager
though
thats
for
sure
overall
a
pretty
good
lager
that
i
would
take
over
a
macro
any
day
drinkability
good
drinkability
due
to
its
light
character
goes
down
like
water
not
offensive
not
exceptional
very
drinkable
i
think
light
and
heavy
beer
drinkers
can
respect
this
beer
nice
cheap
lager
that
has
never
disappointed
me
hv
d
high
with
its
price
and
light
body
this
makes
for
an
idea
session
beer
for
us
college
folk
pours
a
burnt
amber
color
into
a
pint
glass
thicker
head
than
i
expected
but
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
strong
aroma
of
yeast
and
malt
a
hint
of
lemon
lemon
drops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
light
body
taste
is
yeasty
and
sweet
lemon
finishes
with
a
little
sourness
overall
this
beer
has
an
unobtrusive
pleasant
flavor
and
the
price
is
right
fortunately
one
doesnt
have
to
sacrifice
too
much
flavor
for
the
low
price
its
a
simple
and
unassuming
beernot
trying
to
be
anything
it
isnt
pours
a
very
light
amber
color
with
just
a
bit
of
rapidly
diminishing
head
and
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
nice
scent
hints
of
malt
and
a
little
sourness
but
nothing
really
strong
or
really
great
good
taste
its
refreshing
and
clean
but
theres
not
a
lot
there
to
stimulate
the
taste
buds
mostly
just
a
little
hoppier
than
usual
lager
with
some
maltiness
and
a
little
sour
aftertaste
goes
down
fine
but
nothing
great
there
either
a
very
average
beer
but
it
isnt
expensive
and
can
be
easy
to
find
in
many
states
so
thats
a
plus
this
is
by
far
not
my
favorite
beer
however
with
that
said
let
us
continue
the
color
of
a
lager
as
they
are
known
in
these
parts
is
quite
nice
rich
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
there
isnt
much
of
a
smell
to
it
as
i
see
when
you
take
your
first
sip
you
find
yourself
in
a
traditional
american
lager
nothing
special
but
i
just
find
myself
liking
it
i
will
take
it
over
an
american
macro
any
day
it
goes
down
easy
so
many
restaurants
in
the
area
promote
yuengs
and
wings
i
think
also
it
has
an
appeal
because
it
is
a
local
brew
for
me
nevertheless
give
this
one
a
try
a
must
i
was
a
bit
taken
off
guard
to
see
some
bottles
of
these
sitting
on
the
singles
rack
at
winchester
wine
and
spirits
as
far
as
i
knew
yuengling
didnt
distribute
to
this
state
oh
well
i
guess
they
did
in
this
case
pours
clear
orange
with
a
bit
of
white
heading
and
a
good
looking
dosage
of
carbonation
aroma
is
very
clean
with
some
roasted
grain
pizza
dough
hints
of
caramel
taste
is
slightly
more
bitter
with
a
roasted
edge
that
makes
the
carbonation
seem
all
the
more
apparent
body
is
light
and
crisp
on
the
palate
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
keep
it
interesting
this
would
make
an
ideal
session
lager
for
a
warm
day
my
first
brew
from
yuengling
did
not
disappoint
d
i
gave
this
a
high
drinkability
due
to
the
price
abv
and
all
around
decentness
of
this
beer
an
excellent
macro
lager
possibly
the
best
d
its
not
the
best
beer
out
there
but
its
not
bad
real
easy
to
session
and
is
great
on
a
hot
day
with
some
good
new
york
style
pizza
lightbodied
mouthfeel
with
a
fairly
good
level
of
drinkability
also
i
would
reccommend
to
buy
yuengling
in
either
cans
or
1224
packs
the
green
bottles
tend
to
be
skunked
by
the
time
you
get
them
home
in
the
sixers
lots
of
flavor
for
a
traditional
old
school
american
lager
d
quite
drinkable
particularly
on
hot
lazy
summer
afternoons
like
this
one
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
but
one
that
will
quench
the
thirst
low
enough
abv
to
have
several
over
the
course
of
the
afternoon
and
not
get
too
tipsy
im
not
really
a
fan
of
american
lagers
but
if
i
have
to
choose
one
this
is
the
one
i
go
with
to
me
it
seems
much
more
complex
than
the
traditional
american
lager
it
has
some
body
and
color
and
it
doesnt
taste
half
bad
either
i
usually
end
up
drinking
a
few
after
a
softball
game
and
the
taste
never
grows
old
you
can
always
be
sure
that
youll
get
a
decent
tasting
beer
yeungling
claims
to
be
americas
oldest
brewery
id
love
to
go
on
a
brewery
tour
one
of
these
days
now
if
i
can
only
convince
my
wife
recently
found
it
being
used
in
a
black
n
tan
in
a
bar
outside
of
pittsburgh
it
adds
a
little
change
to
the
traditional
harp
or
bass
tans
gm
nice
summer
time
beer
good
session
ale
also
may
be
a
good
alternative
when
you
cant
find
something
better
or
a
good
crossover
beer
definitely
a
nofrills
lager
this
would
make
for
a
great
session
brew
but
youll
likely
find
something
a
little
more
interesting
to
gravitate
towards
i
cant
believe
it
has
been
so
long
that
ive
been
on
this
site
yet
never
reviewed
yuengling
being
back
with
a
pittsburgher
who
had
some
made
me
nostalgic
and
i
finally
got
down
to
it
poured
a
auburnish
brown
with
a
twofinger
head
that
died
slowly
a
faint
hop
smell
with
some
graininess
to
it
a
good
drying
taste
from
the
hops
and
a
smooth
body
complement
this
refreshing
mediumbodied
beer
that
also
contains
some
citric
and
earth
notes
form
wise
not
that
great
of
a
beer
but
it
will
always
be
one
of
my
favorites
by
itself
or
with
a
primanti
bros
sandwich
i
first
tried
this
beer
on
a
trip
to
south
carolina
apparently
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
any
sort
of
a
selection
down
there
it
was
pretty
much
miller
bud
or
yuengling
i
went
with
the
yuengling
not
to
be
dissapointed
it
was
way
better
than
the
other
options
i
surprisingly
drank
quite
a
bit
of
this
stuff
over
a
4
day
period
good
fun
no
beer
poops
d
average
drinkability
could
drink
this
in
a
pinch
but
wont
woo
or
wow
me
during
does
taste
better
deeper
into
the
drink
but
still
is
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
mouthful
and
enjoyment
wise
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
wish
i
could
get
it
in
texas
pours
a
fairly
dark
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
quickly
theres
a
light
malt
aroma
rounded
out
with
the
typical
lager
scent
the
bottom
feeders
continue
to
show
there
stuff
in
the
taste
but
the
hops
do
become
noticeable
in
the
finish
with
the
malty
finish
the
high
carbonation
helps
out
again
definitely
a
good
beer
to
grab
when
the
tap
selection
is
limited
beer
its
not
just
a
beverage
its
food
but
this
is
a
great
tasting
lager
do
not
be
afraid
to
try
it
because
you
wont
regret
it
this
is
one
ive
enjoyed
quite
a
few
times
on
a
hot
day
one
of
the
greatest
attributes
is
the
price
around
heresouthern
virginia
it
usually
costs
the
same
as
budwhich
i
wont
even
compare
theres
no
flash
in
the
taste
or
appearance
or
smell
for
all
that
it
matters
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
thirst
quincher
during
those
hot
summer
days
in
the
midatlantic
and
you
dont
have
stacks
of
money
this
is
your
best
bet
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
valdieu
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
amber
red
with
a
very
small
amount
of
head
after
a
few
sips
i
found
that
this
beer
leaves
absolutely
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
green
bottle
funk
up
front
with
just
a
bit
of
cereal
grain
aroma
the
taste
once
again
has
the
green
bottle
funk
going
on
biscuity
flavors
come
out
next
with
just
a
mellow
sweetness
that
finishes
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
just
a
slight
dryness
a
roommate
brought
me
back
a
sixer
of
this
a
couple
years
before
i
got
into
great
beer
and
i
remember
loving
it
its
a
bit
disappointing
that
now
i
just
find
it
ok
i
would
drink
it
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
or
if
i
was
in
a
bar
with
nothing
better
d
its
very
easy
to
put
down
because
the
flavor
isnt
offensive
and
the
body
is
so
light
and
watery
still
the
smell
is
so
offputting
that
i
found
it
quite
difficult
to
actually
take
that
first
sip
once
i
did
get
that
first
gulp
down
however
things
improved
a
little
bit
yuengling
lager
would
be
a
good
choice
for
an
inexpensive
sessionable
beer
for
camping
or
a
sporting
event
drinkability
a
nice
refreshing
session
andor
lawnmower
beer
tried
a
can
of
this
after
hearing
so
much
about
it
decanted
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
yelloworange
thin
white
head
that
mostly
dissipates
into
a
thin
ring
smells
and
tastes
pretty
simple
mostly
a
light
malty
flavor
not
overly
sweet
but
not
much
dynamic
hops
to
it
smooth
mouthfeel
better
when
its
a
little
cold
overall
its
super
drinkable
a
step
up
from
bland
american
macros
it
has
some
decent
character
and
is
pretty
refreshing
i
would
gladly
pick
up
one
of
these
at
a
summer
party
drinkability
is
good
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
decent
feel
to
this
amber
lager
carbonation
is
nice
and
there
is
some
body
to
it
i
could
hit
this
beer
all
day
long
and
not
get
tired
of
it
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
as
a
step
up
from
the
bmc
offerings
overall
its
not
anywhere
close
to
a
good
micro
craft
brew
but
it
way
better
than
you
average
macro
and
is
certainly
far
from
flavorless
yuengling
certainly
has
its
place
i
wouldnt
bother
to
buy
it
for
myself
unless
there
were
few
options
available
but
its
availability
means
that
this
is
a
common
scenario
overall
not
a
bad
option
just
not
a
great
one
either
yuengling
lager
is
a
no
frills
lager
thats
great
as
a
session
beer
d
session
beer
all
the
way
tmd
soft
and
smooth
a
slightly
sweet
malt
profile
with
a
little
dash
of
hops
pretty
straight
forward
but
thats
sometimes
the
way
things
should
be
finishes
wet
and
refreshing
this
is
one
that
i
might
have
to
go
back
to
over
the
summer
along
with
the
seasonsuitable
pilseners
and
hefeweizens
this
is
an
allaround
good
and
highly
drinkable
beer
is
it
anything
out
of
this
world
no
but
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
what
it
is
and
is
far
better
than
anything
in
its
price
range
this
is
an
oldschool
american
amber
lager
with
flavor
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
those
hot
summer
days
when
you
just
want
something
cold
and
refreshing
d
i
love
strong
barleywines
riss
ipas
and
all
those
big
beers
but
when
i
want
a
beer
to
session
on
i
have
been
looking
to
this
stuff
for
years
especially
with
such
a
low
pricetag
as
american
macros
go
this
is
the
best
inexpensive
its
the
same
price
as
most
macros
on
tap
at
most
bars
but
with
exceptional
taste
absolutely
more
flavor
than
most
macros
it
is
up
there
with
the
best
lagers
that
ive
had
thicker
mouth
feel
than
almost
all
other
beers
you
get
at
regular
bars
its
what
i
get
when
im
at
a
bar
the
bottom
line
yuengling
is
not
a
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
however
if
youre
in
pa
and
visiting
the
hockey
arena
or
the
ballpark
or
even
the
standard
bar
then
this
is
a
great
option
in
lieu
of
the
big
macros
its
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
very
enjoyableorangemoustachemay

because
as
much
as
ive
had
this
beer
i
still
cant
quite
describe
the
flavor
but
i
can
always
taste
it
in
my
mind
its
a
very
unique
flavor
to
me
which
you
cant
beat

thought
yeah
if
your
a
college
student
pretending
to
be
a
beer
nut
then
you
might
raise
a
few
eyebrows
with
this
brew
if
your
a
beer
tyrant
with
a
bit
of
corn
mixed
in
this
is
an
okay
session
ale
just
heard
about
them
supposed
to
be
great
but
this
is
far
from
it
i
dont
know
if
this
one
is
skunked
im
not
impressed
at
all

this
is
pretty
nice
and
a
decent
id
probably
have
already
thrown
more
than
a
few
back
by
now
how
much
does
a
pint
go
for
out
in
panj
i
grew
kind
of
fond
of
this
one
bottle
i
had
sweet
malt
or
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
if
there
were
nice
imports
or
craft
beers
at
the
bar
on
a
nice
summer
evening
sitting
on
the
deck
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
beside
you
it
is
not
available
in
many
places
but
if
you
come
across
it
for
the
first
time
pick
up
a
six
pack
and
enjoy

overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
somewhat
of
an
old
reliable
i
love
this
beer
for
just
lounging
around
and
drinking
its
a
much
better
beer
then
miller
or
budweiser
and
not
that
much
more
expensive
this
is
a
good
american
lager
that
is
good
for
any
occasion
its
not
a
heavy
beer
but
just
a
good
all
around
beer
coming
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
america
they
must
be
continuing
to
do
something
right
all
around
good
beer
not
quite
a
summer
lager
but
a
refeshing
drinkable
beer
that
i
love
with
any
flavorful
food
its
simple
and
cheap
but
it
blows
the
budbrothers
and
millermothas
out
of
the
wort
drink
one
by
the
grill
or
by
the
camp
fire
or
two
while
youre
grilling
on
the
camp
fire
if
you
want
a
six
dollar
six
pack
yuengling
is
my
choice
every
time
i
feel
like
everyone
i
went
to
college
with
is
obsessed
with
this
beer
it
is
good
but
not
amazing
a
definite
session
beer
i
think
it
is
one
that
all
should
try
at
some
point
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
want
something
uncomplicated
but
not
lacking
in
all
flavor
i
get
this
quite
a
bit
actually
when
i
go
to
nonbeer
restaurants
because
its
often
the
best
beer
they
have
color
is
light
brown
or
amber
with
a
thin
off
white
head
smell
is
slightly
musty
cant
pick
up
much
else
taste
is
a
light
sweet
malt
cant
detect
much
else
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
with
prickly
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
although
not
too
impressive
when
compared
to
most
beers
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
to
drink
at
a
bar
party
or
barbeque
it
is
a
very
popular
beer
in
the
phillys
jersey
area
and
usually
order
by
requesting
a
lager
nice
light
amber
apearence
thin
light

a
little

on
the
glass
slight
bready
slight
hop

a

in
the
flavor
a
little

the
taste
over
all
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
would
not
mind
on
a
hot
summer
day
from
the
u
s
oldest
brewery
i
like
this
beer
a
perfect
session
beer
to
drink
on
warm
days
with
your
mates
very
clear
light
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
cap
bubbles
were
fairly
coarse
and

in
the
flavour
with

at
the
end

for
an

bk
i
first
had
this
beer
in
the
poconos
in
pennsylvania
on
tap
it
is
a
red
colored
beer
and
has
a
pretty
good
head
leaves
some
when
finished
on
the
glass
this
beer
is
a
premeire
beer
for
pennsylvanians
it
is
a
good
beer
for
any
type
of
day
or
not
and
whatever
type
of
season
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
finishes
very
well
pours
a
deep
hazy
rubyamber
great
looking
head
tan
and
thick
lots
of
lace
aroma
is
earthy
and
malty
some
grain
not
much
evidence
of
hops
earthy
and
malty
lots
of
grain
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
a
little
bit
of
hop
dryness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
full
this
a
pretty
refreshing
lager
though
not
my
first
choice
more
grainy
reminds
me
of
a
pilsner
flavor
than
i
would
like
out
of
a
darker
lager
i
usually
lean
towards
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
being
from
the
philly
area
you
have
to
take
pride
in
americas
oldest
brewery
d
very
drinkable
in
single
or
insession
overall
i
find
yuengling
traditional
lager
to
be
very
drinkable
although
it
has
a
slightly
odd
aftertaste
its
a
truly
a
present
whenever
i
get
a
chance
to
drink
it
based
on
its
price
it
would
probably
be
a
standard
in
my
fridge
overall
this
beer
is
an
institution
in
pa
and
can
be
found
ontap
at
virtually
every
corner
bar
beats
the
pants
off
of
the
bmc
brands
and
has
a
character
all
its
own
a
reliable
and
tasty
lager
dont
change
yuengling
d
while
this
isnt
an
exceptional
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
very
distinct
flavor
at
least
to
me
and
is
very
enjoyable
given
low
abv
and
pleasing
aftertaste
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
i
add
an
extra
5
in
this
category
for
its
price
and
availability
where
im
from
as
i
would
happily
drink
this
over
any
bmc
product
also
its
americas
oldest
operating
brewery
or
whatever
that
counts
for
something
right
body
is
between
light
and
medium
with
average
mouthfeel
and
drinakbility
better
than
your
standard
macro
crap
but
realy
doesnt
taste
like
much
to
me
d
this
was
introduced
to
me
years
ago
by
a
friend
of
mine
he
had
bought
a
12
pack
of
it
out
of
state
it
is
seldom
that
i
buy
a
u
s
macro
but
when
i
do
it
is
usually
yuengling
di
would
have
this
beer
in
the
face
of
macro
brew
but
wouldnt
look
to
buy
this
in
bulk
d
ive
had
this
many
times
ice
cold
from
a
green
bottle
no
pint
glass
and
it
was
excellent
in
fact
4th
of
july
wouldnt
be
the
same
without
it
neither
would
memorial
day
out
of
this
brown
22oz
with
a
new
contemporary
nonpaper
logo
it
leans
heavy
toward
the
malt
side
and
feels
funny
overall
maybe
i
should
review
again
when
i
get
some
more
of
the
stuff
im
used
to
light
bodied
and
refreshing
it
has
a
bit
more
maltiness
and
sweetness
than
i
expected
but
in
a
pleasant
way
not
complex
but
i
will
go
back
to
this
one
when
my
options
are
few
around
leinenkugels
quality
a
bit
above
most
macros
poured
into
a
large
mug
straight
from
the
bottle
a
thick
puffy
head
of
foam
appeared
and
transformed
into
a
thin
lace
in
about
15
minutes
it
was
a
orangecopper
color
with
a
medium
body
the
after
taste
was
pretty
grainy
but
not
overpowering
this
in
general
is
a
medium
beer
it
is
medium
in
body
carbonation
and
taste
it
is
a
great
beer
to
have
if
you
are
tired
of
hoppy
or
heavy
beers
yuengling
is
a
beer
that
would
work
with
the
typical
macro
drinker
or
the
beer
enthusiast
pours
amber
color
with
decent
head
smells
lightly
of
malts
but
much
tastes
kind
of
bready
sweet
malts
some
hop
spice
pretty
good
for
a
macro
lager
it
is
what
it
is
and
i
would
say
its
definitely
top3
as
far
as
the
best
american
macro
lager
genre
is
concerned
light
and
carbonated
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
this
stuff
is
not
sold
where
i
am
so
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
it
and
i
believe
it
rivals
heine
as
an
everydayboring
lager
ill
buy
more
when
i
can
overall
very
anticlimatic
other
than
the
appearance
there
is
almost
nothing
else
going
on
we
call
em
dingers
around
here
the
best
macro
on
the
market
easy
on
the
pallet
nothing
offensive
not
great
good
beer
for
an
all
nighter
or
a
week
long
binge
in
myrtle
beach
or
pinehurst
i
like
this
beer
alot
when
i
am
broke
and
cant
afford
my
usuals
d
it
gets
some
extra
points
for
being
yuengling
because
i
grew
up
on
it
and
know
that
i
have
drunk
it
all
night
before
nice
golden
amber
color
with
minimal
head
smells
a
bit
grainy
with
mild
hops
and
carbonation
and
finishes
with
a
hint
of
diacetyl
very
drinkable
it
has
a
qualityprice
ratio
that
is
vastly
superior
to
typical
american
macro
lagers
makes
a
great
comfort
beer
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
no
lacing
present
magnificent
amber
body
good
light
crisp
fragrance
very
sweet
and
a
little
creamy
good
carbination
dry
finish
not
much
there
in
the
end
this
is
a
good
beer
to
take
out
golfing
or
on
a
fishing
trip
but
nothing
i
would
bring
out
for
company
drank
it
from
a
pint
glass
very
clear
without
hurting
its
amber
appearance
but
the
head
is
quite
thin
and
disappears
quick
nice
sweet
hoppy
taste
for
a
macro
brew
but
feels
watery
on
the
palate
carbonation
might
be
a
little
strong
going
down
but
once
again
quite
good
for
a
macro
d
easy
to
drink
hell
at
this
point
in
my
career
most
beers
are
easy
to
drink
some
may
call
it
a
macro
with
caramel
coloring
but
this
beer
has
more
body
and
taste
than
most
for
nine
dollars
a
twelver
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
especially
for
a
macro
if
i
could
find
it
in
the
midwest
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
almost
amber
color
it
has
a
pretty
good
taste
fairly
malty
and
hoppy
the
taste
finishes
crisp
and
clean
a
decent
beer
d
one
of
the
best
session
beers
out
there
great
for
tailgating
and
golfing
and
one
of
the
starter
beers
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
was
my
session
beer
of
choice
when
i
lived
in
ny
and
i
think
it
was
the
first
pitcher
of
beer
that
i
ever
had
so
i
have
a
special
spot
for
it
where
yuengling
does
things
right
is
in
the
drinkability
this
is
headandshoulders
above
the
macro
lagers
and
even
has
an
edge
on
a
number
of
crafts
its
an
everyday
beer
a
beer
that
you
dont
have
to
be
in
a
mood
to
drink
ive
had
days
where
i
dont
feel
like
drinking
a
porter
or
a
stout
or
an
ale
or
even
a
craft
lager
but
ive
never
had
a
day
where
i
didnt
feel
like
having
a
yuengling
its
just
a
solid
brew
for
any
time
any
place
this
is
not
the
greatest
lager
in
the
world
but
definitely
not
the
worst
for
its
price
its
an
excellent
value
and
a
much
better
product
than
the
other
american
megapales
out
there
a
vendor
that
works
for
me
went
to
penn
for
the
osu
game
he
gave
me
and
a
co
worker
a
twelve
pack
to
split
wow
this
beer
in
a
sense
is
amazing
it
has
a
big
brew
taste
but
a
little
more
complex
huge
malt
flavor
and
some
yeast
i
didnt
detect
much
hop
flavor
but
i
do
not
have
a
great
palate
great
color
and
mouth
feel
i
wish
they
sold
the
whole
line
here
in
ohio
i
would
really
like
to
try
the
porter
i
would
suggest
this
beer
to
anyone
to
at
least
try
a
peice
of
history
that
uses
tradition
that
big
brewers
have
left
behind
solid
no
frills
not
bad
again
not
the
best
flavor
smell
or
appearance
i
have
had
but
there
is
just
something
about
it
that
keeps
it
at
the
top
of
my
favorites
list
overall
a
very
good
lager
one
of
my
favorites
and
for
the
money
you
cant
beat
it
not
to
heavy
not
to
light
a
beer
you
can
have
several
of
and
not
feel
full
yet
its
not
like
drinking
water
its
an
amber
lager
by
color
but
close
your
eyes
and
it
might
be
coors
banquet
beer
this
is
not
bad
beer
but
not
good
either
it
is
boutique
macro
lager
with
a
darker
color
and
a
wee
bit
more
body
and
flavor
or
so
your
eyes
tell
you
when
you
see
it
in
your
glass
i
like
the
brewerys
history
and
longevity
but
im
not
fond
of
the
way
it
has
positioned
itself
in
the
market
as
virtual
craft
beer
in
the
eyes
of
the
college
boys
who
think
theyre
going
upmarket
on
this
one
around
my
neck
of
the
woods
it
is
the
same
price
as
coors
banquet
so
ill
just
stay
honest
and
drink
the
coors
its
a
good
beer
though
if
you
find
yourself
in
a
dismal
bar
that
only
has
bud
light
miller
lite
coors
light
and
corona
it
tastes
of
faint
crystal
malt
and
some
corn
and
often
wet
cardboard
i
had
it
fresh
once
and
it
had
the
diacetyl
thing
going
on
which
was
weird
but
at
least
it
masked
the
adjunct
flavor
still
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
see
this
brewery
go
changing
or
nuthin
cans
get
the
cans
i
recommend
it
pours
a
golden
brown
color
with
no
head
i
really
didnt
notice
much
to
the
smell
the
taste
seemed
a
bit
watered
down
if
you
could
really
call
it
a
taste
i
was
definitely
unimpressed
with
this
beer
and
am
confused
as
to
why
so
many
people
rate
it
better
this
is
just
an
average
beer
nothing
complex
about
it
but
also
nothing
offensive
either
although
it
is
very
watery
had
a
cold
pint
of
one
of
my
old
favorites
at
the
sherwood
golf
club
in
titusvill
florida
it
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
nearly
no
head
and
very
little
evidence
of
any
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
but
pleasant
blending
brown
sugar
and
malt
the
taste
is
a
sweet
wheatcereal
with
a
touch
of
maple
in
there
its
very
sprite
and
refreshing
evenly
carbonated
but
generally
kind
of
thin
bodied
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
a
sweeter
lager
with
not
much
guts
its
always
an
acceptable
brew
especially
after
18
holes
with
a
couple
of
pals
nothing
too
memorable
but
ok
and
better
than
any
macros
i
can
think
of
i
just
dont
see
what
everyone
in
this
area
gets
excited
about
when
drinking
this
beer
way
way
way
overcarbonated
almost
undrinkable
to
me
for
that
reason
this
might
be
the
most
overrated
beer
on
the
market
clear
copper
with
a
rich
off
white
head
white
dies
down
quickly
to
a
film
lighttomoderate
lacing
light
and
clean
smell
only
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
hops
taste
was
mildmannered
and
clean
but
not
light
a
pleasant
mixture
of
hops
and
light
malty
sweetness
like
light
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
has
a
rich
creaminess
to
it
and
modest
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
44
go
to
alternative
to
the
bmc
crew
the
price
5
49
at
the
local
grocery
is
also
hard
to
beat
d
very
drinkable
if
you
want
to
drink
a
12
pack
light
enough
on
your
stomach
that
you
could
do
so
too
commercialized
for
me
and
my
interests
but
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
on
something
besides
bud
light
or
miller
lite
it
will
work
very
much
of
a
session
beer
a
step
above
the
bmc
class
but
still
nothing
special
perfect
amount
of
hops
and
grain
and
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
lager
makes
it
one
of
the
best
full
bodied
lagers
around
overall
just
not
my
style
but
still
a
fine
beer
i
know
i
already
said
it
twice
but
it
really
taste
alot
like
a
heine
if
you
are
about
taste
and
not
a
label
snob
and
you
are
a
heine
lover
give
this
beer
a
shot
for
your
money
you
can
buy
twice
as
many
ok
this
isnt
going
to
compare
to
a
cask
ale
or
a
belgian
but
for
812
pack
it
simply
cant
be
beat
the
taste
is
very
light
and
easily
palatable
ive
told
people
before
id
almost
describe
it
as
newcastle
light
it
has
the
similar
nutty
taste
as
newcastle
with
a
lighter
character
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
very
light
lacey
head
smell
is
of
a
light
malt
smells
beery
the
taste
is
of
a
light
amber
lager
nothing
really
special
about
it
i
could
put
down
quite
a
few
in
a
night
given
the
chance
at
the
price
this
sells
at
you
cant
beat
it
around
here
though
there
are
better
options
basically
you
could
do
far
far
worse
than
yuengling
its
not
the
best
beer
out
there
but
for
5
50
a
pitcher
at
wings
and
ale
its
a
far
cry
better
than
the
other
brews
on
tap
after
a
long
day
at
work
it
tastes
a
whole
lot
better
too
hard
not
to
give
this
a
high
drinkability
at
4
9
and
with
a
nonoffensive
taste
you
should
be
able
to
drink
this
all
night
that
is
if
you
wanted
to
not
outstanding
but
still
a
good
lager
drinkability
incredibly
drinkable
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
is
okay
its
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
i
really
could
session
this
all
night
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
for
anyone
near
pa
or
the
east
coast
give
it
a
try
its
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
surprisingly
pretty
good
the
appearance
is
still
quite
a
nice
amber
with
a
decent
head
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
the
flavor
profile
just
seems
weaker
than
before
i
hope
im
not
becoming
a
beer
snob
on
this
because
i
used
to
reallly
enjoy
yuengling
it
is
possible
that
i
prefer
the
draft
or
other
styles
by
these
guys
to
this
but
i
really
dont
think
its
good
for
much
other
than
having
it
on
a
hot
beach
or
some
other
summer
outdoor
activity
drinkability
a
fairly
plain
brew
with
very
average
sessionability
there
are
cheaper
options
with
as
much
or
more
flavor
overall
this
is
a
good
macrolager
its
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
interest
it
has
a
simple
appeal
but
is
not
flavorless
drinkability
for
me
this
is
a
great
beer
this
is
my
session
beer
i
love
having
this
in
my
fridge
as
my
everday
brew
wish
i
could
get
it
here
in
la
amber
pour
with
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
next
to
no
lacing
on
glass
not
a
whole
lot
of
hop
character
to
this
one
much
better
than
macro
pale
lagers
and
not
overcarbonated
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
aroma
is
fairly
benign
with
hints
of
caramel
malt
this
is
one
of
the
first
dark
beers
i
ever
had
when
i
was
a
young
kid
needless
to
say
i
knew
nothing
at
the
time
about
beer
a
highly
drinkable
beer
nothing
really
offensive
about
it
pours
a
decent
head
without
lacing
the
smell
is
slightly
skunky
and
also
pours
an
oftred
color
taste
is
pretty
grainy
and
smooth
not
well
balanced
as
there
are
really
not
any
hops
to
speak
of
but
nonetheless
a
decent
highly
drinkable
beer
the
pour
is
a
nice
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
of
medium
size
head
disipates
somewhat
quickly
nose
is
grainy
but
not
excessive
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
present
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
in
the
intro
but
balances
out
nicely
finish
is
crisp
and
aftertaste
screams
for
another
drink
this
is
a
wonderful
step
up
in
body
and
flavor
from
the
traditional
macros
but
not
cloying
like
many
of
the
ambers
out
there
good
stuff
yuengling
beer
is
very
popular
in
hilton
head
sc
presumably
due
to
all
the
transplanted
pennyslvanians
it
is
a
smooth
amber
brew
somewhat
rather
bland
in
flavor
it
has
a
taste
that
goes
down
easy
and
can
sneak
up
on
you
i
would
be
nice
if
a
distributer
would
pick
it
up
in
georgia
so
i
dont
have
to
travel
across
state
lines
appropriately
amber
colored
with
an
average
amount
of
head
with
an
averagetoshort
lifespan
nose
is
grainy
with
a
decent
malt
presence
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
unexpectedly
sweet
but
not
offensively
so
with
some
balance
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
clean
making
this
one
quite
drinkablesomething
the
taste
itself
cant
do
earlier
in
the
day
i
had
an
iron
city
lager
and
this
one
is
preferable
for
certain
this
isnt
bad
bad
beer
but
when
i
drank
religiously
i
swear
it
never
tasted
like
this
and
now
it
taste
sorda
crappy
i
guess
my
palate
changed
alot
in
the
past
two
years
this
is
a
very
average
beer
in
all
ways
the
head
is
okay
but
dissipates
quickly
there
is
little
if
any
lacing
and
the
smell
is
metallic
and
has
macro
written
all
over
it
the
taste
is
on
the
dry
side
decently
carbonated
and
i
detect
some
maltiness
that
is
bordering
on
a
carmel
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
hoppy
the
beer
is
light
bodied
although
the
amber
color
does
raise
expectations
a
bit
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
only
average
on
a
summers
picnic
what
the
heck
drink
a
few
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
you
could
also
do
much
better
but
in
the
antiquity
stakes
one
has
to
try
yuengling
for
its
historical
value
if
nothing
else
a
gifted
one
quart
bottle
from
a
yuengling
fanatic
interested
to
give
it
a
try
after
all
the
talk
pours
a
clear
amber
with
intense
carbonation
a
two
finger
white
head
held
by
bubbles
aroma
is
hoppier
than
your
average
macro
faint
hop
smell
but
it
is
present
mixed
with
yeasty
aromas
and
a
bit
of
that
adjunct
smell
reminds
me
of
the
budweiser
brewery
to
be
honest
not
ultra
psyched
at
this
point
taste
is
a
letdown
its
very
bud
like
its
clean
but
watery
and
nonthreatening
i
dont
mind
it
but
its
not
an
amazing
taste
less
aftertaste
than
bud
id
say
and
that
is
an
improvement
warmed
up
its
more
of
the
same
on
the
whole
the
more
i
drank
the
less
i
liked
much
like
when
i
drink
a
macro
one
is
plenty
the
rest
of
the
bottle
ended
up
getting
sampled
by
friends
and
drainpoured
in
one
way
or
another
better
than
bud
i
guess
overall
its
a
cheap
beer
price
and
if
i
were
local
and
the
kind
of
person
that
felt
like
this
was
the
kind
of
beer
to
turn
to
when
hot
and
sweaty
id
choose
this
over
others
but
im
not
so
the
bottom
line
for
me
is
it
has
adjuncts
that
do
not
enhance
the
flavor
and
it
is
very
noticeable
and
i
i
like
the
flavor
of
beer
so
i
dont
want
it
tamed
down
or
muted
by
flavorless
adjuncts
so
give
me
a
malty
pale
ale
or
a
good
pils
instead
md
crisp
carbonation
and
thin
body
make
this
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
enjoyable
to
drink
a
nice
summer
treat
though
hard
to
come
by
in
these
parts
snagged
this
batch
in
ny
i
got
this
out
of
a
keg
at
a
major
gathering
it
pours
a
rich
dark
amber
or
honey
color
rather
inviting
aroma
is
strong
and
quite
malty
not
complex
but
pleasant
flavor
is
full
malty
rather
pleasing
it
fills
the
mouth
and
is
not
at
all
watery
plain
but
drinkable
and
good
for
parties
i
have
since
had
it
in
the
bottle
and
find
it
better
than
the
can
but
still
not
as
good
as
on
tap
has
anyone
else
experienced
this
with
yuengling
drinkability
if
youre
looking
to
pound
back
a
lot
of
beer
this
is
a
good
one
to
do
it
with
its
a
step
above
your
typical
draft
domestics
but
still
not
a
topshelf
type
of
beer
good
taste
but
nothing
thats
going
to
blow
you
out
of
the
water
12oz
green
bottle
tap
version
also
sampled
have
always
loved
the
label
of
an
american
bald
eagle
with
its
talon
resting
on
a
beer
cask
makes
me
feel
patriotic
as
i
enjoy
a
fresh
sample
from
americas
oldest
brewery
pours
amber
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
and
has
macro
style
almost
sodapop
sized
bubbles
smells
of
corn
like
a
macro
beer
concentrated
times
three
subtle
bittering
hop
nose
of
fresh
mown
hay
taste
is
a
very
light
and
subtle
balance
of
sweetcornmalt
and
bittering
hops
carbonation
makes
this
a
crisp
light
and
refreshing
beer
no
surprises
as
far
as
taste
its
just
a
simple
light
refresher
thats
a
few
notches
better
than
budmillercoors
a
bit
better
than
killians
because
of
the
slight
edge
in
hop
flavor
i
would
advise
buying
by
the
case
to
protect
this
green
bottle
beer
from
getting
lightstruck
and
skunky
this
beer
is
all
the
rage
in
ohio
a
ton
of
people
talk
about
it
and
i
think
it
is
just
because
it
is
not
distributed
in
ohio
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
it
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
but
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
of
beer
it
is
much
better
than
some
other
attempts
at
this
beer
from
some
of
the
big
breweries
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
think
it
is
somewhat
overrated
overall
an
easy
drinking
lager
very
servicable
not
a
bad
effort
and
i
have
wanted
to
review
yuengling
since
i
first
had
it
3
years
ago
d
if
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
somehow
transfered
into
a
slightly
better
smelling
and
feeling
brew
i
might
enjoy
it
as
it
was
i
have
to
disagree
with
the
enjoyableness
of
yuengling
lager
given
some
proper
distribution
this
beer
could
give
pbr
a
run
for
its
money
in
my
opinion
im
sure
it
will
remain
pennsylvanias
dirty
little
secret
but
it
would
be
nice
to
see
a
beer
like
this
come
along
and
break
up
the
macro
lager
monotony
not
great
but
its
something
a
little
unique
amongst
its
peers
d
since
its
so
thin
its
pretty
drinkable
but
the
skunk
killed
it
for
me
drink
this
in
a
can
its
not
great
but
its
much
better
or
better
yet
dont
drink
this
at
all
unless
the
only
option
is
bmc
go
get
some
jw
dundees
if
you
want
an
excellent
cheap
lager
pours
a
light
amber
color
somewhat
of
a
thin
head
but
decent
carbonation
pretty
average
smell
is
nothing
special
to
me
just
some
lagerness
to
it
some
malts
but
not
overly
so
taste
definitely
isnt
too
complex
but
very
refreshing
good
balance
and
about
as
good
as
many
other
lagers
ive
tried
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
but
not
watered
down
not
bad
drinkability
is
ultra
high
as
i
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
beer
and
its
so
light
and
easy
to
consume
no
way
i
can
give
it
a
5
because
overall
this
beer
doesnt
stack
up
to
a
5
in
any
category
definitely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
out
there
though
the
most
affordable
and
still
pretty
good
beer
that
you
could
possibly
buy
thats
for
sure
not
bad
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
drink
it
on
tap
drink
it
from
the
bottle
this
beer
is
satisfying
and
if
youre
in
a
pinch
for
cash
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
punish
yourself
with
other
watered
down
options
for
the
same
price
when
you
can
get
so
much
more
with
this
baby
most
places
that
serve
this
stuff
on
tap
serve
it
ice
cold
in
a
frosted
glass
i
hate
that
frosted
glasses
a
pet
peeve
of
mine
i
prefer
this
beer
cold
but
not
so
cold
that
it
kills
the
flavor
d
this
is
a
great
gasstation
beer
in
sc
when
youre
with
the
family
grilling
ribs
and
drinking
from
the
bottle
not
bad
especially
at
9
a
12
pack
drunk
from
the
bottle
showed
a
rich
amber
colour
i
was
at
first
put
off
by
the
green
bottle
but
the
beer
did
not
taste
at
all
lightstruck
it
had
a
watery
mouthfeel
but
tasted
decent
with
a
medium
amount
of
hops
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
i
was
still
generally
pleased
with
this
beer
pours
a
mid
amber
color
with
a
smallish
thin
white
head
malty
with
a
hop
subtleness
that
balances
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
well
crafted
lager
and
one
that
would
be
easy
to
session
goes
great
with
a
good
pizza
if
you
cant
get
a
good
glass
outta
this
one
its
because
you
got
a
bad
keg
well
this
is
certainly
a
staple
beer
for
those
who
want
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
than
the
macros
its
darker
in
color
has
more
of
a
malty
flavor
and
less
bitterness
and
skunk
and
is
very
drinkable
its
certainly
one
of
the
gateway
beers
out
there
along
with
others
like
sam
adams
and
killians
take
it
for
what
its
worth
d
i
used
to
drink
this
particular
beer
by
the
pitcher
when
checking
out
local
bands
at
basement
clubs
since
it
was
available
everywhere
it
was
a
good
social
shareable
brew
back
then
it
was
convenient
and
i
hadnt
yet
adopted
the
motto
drink
better
drink
less
i
realised
yuengling
lager
gave
me
headaches
even
if
i
had
only
two
or
three
i
found
them
to
be
drinkable
when
choices
are
limited
but
this
was
the
first
taste
i
have
had
of
a
yuengling
product
in
years
an
over
all
good
beer
especially
for
a
social
gathering
or
some
pizza
and
a
game
definitely
a
pleasant
tasting
reasonably
priced
session
beer
and
one
substantialy
better
than
many
of
its
competitors
but
i
think
that
all
things
considered
regional
bias
goes
a
long
way
still
its
an
old
standby
and
a
taste
of
home
when
on
the
road
pours
a
beautiful
crystal
clear
dark
amber
with
golden
highlights
little
to
no
head
slightly
dusty
viennastyle
malt
aroma
with
a
sweet
cooked
corn
character
underneath
not
too
pleasant
the
taste
is
on
the
maltycorny
side
with
the
malts
hitting
first
but
being
quickly
overtaken
by
a
lightly
sweetandsour
taste
hop
bitterness
is
quite
low
and
the
finish
is
surprisingly
thick
mouthfeel
is
standard
for
the
style
light
and
fairly
fizzy
overall
this
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
does
make
a
good
safety
beer
when
times
are
tough
pours
a
very
clear
pale
amber
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
some
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
not
very
good
smells
grainy
corn
very
similar
to
bud
the
taste
is
that
of
a
more
malty
budweiser
it
tastes
like
they
use
adjuncts
though
i
am
not
sure
has
an
artifical
sweetner
taste
i
feel
the
taste
gets
worse
as
it
warms
the
feel
is
light
and
watery
and
leaves
an
unpleasant
dry
aftertaste
i
thought
this
would
have
been
labeled
as
an
american
macro
which
would
have
probably
helped
its
review
but
as
an
american
amber
lager
this
is
not
very
good
drinks
easy
as
most
american
macros
do
d
i
still
consume
more
yuengling
than
any
other
beer
i
can
session
this
all
night
and
not
be
sick
of
it
i
do
however
strongly
prefer
the
draft
version
of
this
if
you
want
to
try
a
good
yeungling
get
it
on
tap
the
aftertaste
is
smooth
and
with
a
slight
kick
very
clean
overall
a
good
well
rounded
beer
although
tends
to
be
a
bit
light
it
is
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
not
a
bad
lager
as
im
not
a
lager
guy
i
have
one
more
bottle
ill
keep
until
summer
and
try
it
then
and
if
you
are
ever
in
northeastern
pennsylvania
i
highly
recomend
stopping
by
for
a
tour
of
the
historic
brewery
you
might
even
meet
one
of
the
yuengling
daughters
there
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
the
head
was
thick
at
first
but
quickly
dissipated
wonderful
amber
color
pleasant
aroma
but
nothing
incredible
i
think
i
may
have
chilled
it
to
too
cold
a
temperature
so
i
didnt
taste
it
fully
but
it
was
quite
palatable
and
tasty
despite
this
overall
not
my
favorite
for
savoring
but
good
for
a
barbecue
or
party
where
you
dont
want
to
insult
your
guests
with
bud
im
currently
living
in
pa
so
this
is
currently
my
local
brew
of
choice
for
relaxing
with
friends
a
great
choice
that
wont
drain
your
cash
flow
this
reminds
me
of
jw
dundees
honey
brown
its
a
sweet
beer
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malted
barley
flavor
thats
dominated
by
sweetness
the
aroma
hinted
strongly
at
the
use
of
adjucts
id
guess
corn
on
this
one
but
i
could
be
wrong
still
theres
a
bit
of
decent
malt
that
makes
this
an
amber
this
is
a
beer
id
accept
from
a
friend
and
drink
but
never
pay
for
it
is
also
great
to
have
on
hand
at
parties
for
every
one
loves
a
beer
from
pottsville
for
people
who
dont
care
what
beer
they
drink
and
morally
just
go
to
bud
this
is
a
great
beer
to
get
them
hooked
on
all
in
all
a
very
tasty
massproduced
local
for
me
beer
clear
golden
with
an
amber
tint
thin
white
head
disappears
rather
quickly
pale
malty
aroma
grainy
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
at
the
end
some
sweetness
pale
malt
flavors
grainy
astringent
there
is
a
decent
body
for
the
stlye
not
overly
carbonated
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
is
going
on
here
not
bad
in
a
pinch
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
found
this
amber
macro
on
vacation
and
couldnt
pass
up
the
price
pours
out
a
mild
amber
color
with
fizzy
rather
than
foamy
head
just
when
i
began
to
fear
this
would
be
a
good
giveaway
beer
i
smelled
the
rich
hoppy
aroma
intrigued
i
tasted
a
solid
and
flavorful
amber
at
a
reasonable
price
wish
this
was
in
my
area
this
ones
not
totally
lifeless
or
unappealing
but
still
average
overall
there
are
better
domestic
macro
lagers
for
the
same
or
less
where
i
live
money
d
i
would
drink
this
and
keep
this
in
the
fridge
but
will
not
be
the
first
i
grab
d
this
beer
does
the
job
its
exactly
what
i
expected
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
im
not
about
to
bash
it
because
of
the
size
of
the
brewery
personally
i
dont
care
for
these
lighter
lagers
but
as
far
as
being
a
good
representation
of
the
style
this
fits
like
a
glove
this
one
is
definitely
a
couple
of
shades
darker
than
your
average
macrolager
a
nice
deep
gold
it
sports
a
sudsy
head
that
shrinks
rapidly
but
never
disappears
the
smell
is
faint
but
theres
some
good
bready
malt
and
toasted
grain
mixed
in
with
citrus
and
tealike
hops
a
nice
balance
going
on
there
in
the
taste
theres
more
hops
here
than
in
your
typical
macrolager
and
the
toasted
grain
comes
through
as
well
adjuncts
seem
to
have
been
used
sparingly
this
brews
main
failing
is
in
mouthfeel
it
comes
across
as
watery
making
that
nice
flavor
all
too
shortlived
i
dont
expect
it
to
be
thick
and
palatecoating
like
an
ipa
but
even
for
a
lager
this
one
is
too
watery
even
so
this
is
what
budmilcoors
should
be
overall
a
pretty
average
brew
overall
which
is
to
say
better
than
virtually
any
other
macrolager
a
good
alternative
at
your
local
watering
hole
ok
my
last
one
for
now
these
macro
reviews
are
killing
my
tastebuds
well
not
really
giving
them
a
workout
would
be
more
accurate
well
i
guess
yuengling
isnt
really
a
macro
but
still
a
light
lager
so
i
went
ahead
and
added
them
into
my
tasting
poured
a
decent
amber
with
a
small
white
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
and
very
clear
consistency
at
least
the
tone
has
a
decent
reddish
tint
smell
was
full
of
grains
and
not
really
much
else
slight
hint
at
a
caramel
or
sugar
sweetness
but
very
slight
and
only
as
it
warmed
the
taste
was
a
little
musty
grain
corn
and
grass
flavors
were
the
big
players
here
slight
amount
of
caramel
trying
to
come
through
but
never
really
made
it
the
feel
was
very
smooth
decent
body
not
as
light
as
some
others
overall
it
had
a
bit
more
of
a
flavor
profile
then
some
of
the
others
did
but
still
needs
a
little
work
i
could
see
myself
having
one
at
a
ball
game
if
it
were
between
this
and
bmc
a
very
drinkable
lager
one
of
my
favorites
when
im
out
at
a
bar
with
a
lessthanimpressive
selection
of
beers
or
when
money
is
an
issue
of
course
being
on
tap
always
helps
as
well
went
well
with
my
chicken
quesadilla
poured
from
the
tap
to
an
amber
color
with
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
and
left
okay
lacing
som
ehops
in
the
aroma
but
nothing
dominant
likewise
with
the
taste
at
only
4
9
the
alcohol
never
made
itself
known
and
the
finish
was
okay
but
nothing
special
i
can
see
how
this
could
make
a
decent
lowpriced
session
beer
but
for
quality
rating
it
left
something
to
be
desired
this
is
nicer
than
most
macros
but
still
a
pretty
thin
brew
overall
this
brew
isnt
too
bad
for
what
id
consider
an
american
macro
lager
this
was
served
to
me
on
tap
in
a
pint
glass
and
it
didnt
really
have
much
head
acually
no
head
the
body
was
a
reddish
amber
and
crystal
clear
i
couldnt
really
detect
much
aroma
but
a
slight
light
straw
or
hay
aroma
tastes
pretty
smooth
a
little
bit
of
a
sweeter
lager
but
nothing
too
exciting
even
though
the
taste
isnt
really
impressive
this
brew
does
flow
down
nicely
and
is
a
bit
refreshing
if
you
like
pizza
and
beer
try
yuengling
and
the
pizza
from
a
local
pizza
parlor
not
a
chaini
e
any
holeinthewall
with
an
owner
born
in
chicago
or
new
york
that
is
the
perfect
american
meal
d
in
spite
of
this
beers
history
i
was
not
impressed
i
tried
and
tried
but
could
get
almost
no
hops
influence
from
this
beer
i
dont
feel
left
out
that
i
cannot
get
this
in
colorado
i
had
a
friend
bring
this
beer
back
to
il
last
summer
i
had
never
seen
it
i
had
heard
the
name
before
thats
it
i
do
enjoy
it
coming
from
chicago
and
the
land
of
bud
light
and
miller
lite
it
was
nice
to
see
a
beer
that
in
my
opinion
is
just
a
basic
beer
but
with
taste
i
just
got
home
from
pa
and
did
stop
in
pottsville
and
bought
some
of
the
traditional
lager
so
i
will
give
some
to
my
neighbor
and
enjoy
the
rest
myself
i
just
wish
it
was
available
outside
the
east
coast
it
is
a
better
choice
than
macros
and
i
can
get
it
around
here
for
the
same
price
without
a
doubt
you
need
to
try
you
will
not
be
disappointed
yuengling
pours
a
clear
redgold
with
a
thin
foamy
head
smell
is
sweet
and
grainy
taste
is
a
grainy
malt
flavor
very
little
hops
only
a
very
slight
bitterness
yuengling
is
better
than
some
but
nothing
special
really
just
a
good
macro
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
drinkability
may
be
the
biggest
selling
point
for
this
beer
whether
im
looking
for
a
quality
6pack
to
chill
out
to
during
a
game
or
im
buying
a
few
cases
for
a
huge
party
im
going
with
yuengling
traditional
lager
i
didnt
buy
this
bottle
no
i
didnt
steal
it
either
and
i
would
never
buy
this
lifes
too
short
to
drink
average
beer
d
this
beer
is
very
light
but
the
malt
flavors
are
very
nice
it
would
be
nice
to
have
some
hop
flavors
to
balance
them
or
cover
the
sulfury
notes
a
bit
love
this
beer
for
its
price
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
better
than
any
of
the
macros
out
there
too
bad
you
cant
have
it
in
la
hope
they
market
this
beer
all
over
the
country
a
lot
of
beer
lover
is
missing
a
lot
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
was
when
i
had
to
picked
up
my
cousin
who
attended
penn
state
and
even
went
to
the
brewerey
in
pottsville
great
beer
for
the
price
d
yuengling
lager
has
a
permanent
special
place
in
my
beer
pantheon
it
was
the
first
nonmacro
that
id
ever
had
and
it
got
me
through
4
5
years
at
dear
old
state
drinkability
this
is
clearly
a
marketed
beer
for
those
who
want
something
unassuming
and
affordable
it
is
so
blah
that
i
dont
feel
like
i
am
drinking
anything
wouldnt
bother
paying
for
it
d
the
best
part
of
this
beer
oddly
enough
given
that
none
of
its
other
scores
are
all
that
high
is
that
its
pretty
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
got
a
little
more
flavor
and
body
than
the
average
american
macro
lager
and
its
dirt
cheap
compared
to
craft
brews
a
great
postlawnmowing
beer
or
to
be
used
as
im
using
it
now
drinking
some
of
it
pouring
some
of
it
into
the
chili
im
making
pretty
good
session
beer
but
nothing
remarkable
flavor
wise
dark
amber
with
minimal
head
on
the
pour
smells
of
corn
and
taste
is
the
same
no
lingering
aftertaste
to
speak
of
from
the
bottle
i
prefer
yeunglings
black
and
tan
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
far
better
on
tap
i
buy
this
every
few
months
as
its
my
beer
from
home
and
ill
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
a
lager
used
it
to
wash
down
some
perogies
seemed
appropriate
not
a
good
day
for
kegged
beer
it
still
poured
a
nice
red
color
with
an
offwhite
thick
head
smelled
ok
and
malty
like
yuengling
normally
does
the
taste
was
barely
existent
kind
of
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
the
beer
was
still
pretty
drinkable
but
i
had
to
switch
to
the
bottle
afterwards
in
order
to
get
the
better
yuengling
taste
that
im
used
to
the
main
thing
to
know
about
this
brew
is
that
it
is
much
better
out
of
the
bottle
and
can
than
it
is
out
of
the
keg
out
of
the
keg
it
is
way
to
sweet
i
got
this
bottle
at
prime
time
sports
grill
and
enjoyed
it
it
was
dark
in
color
but
not
out
of
the
lager
category
it
was
malty
but
not
to
malty
if
i
had
to
critisize
this
i
would
say
that
there
was
nothing
special
about
it
in
an
ironic
way
that
makes
it
even
the
more
special
good
brew
dont
drink
and
review
not
bad
screw
top
green
bottle
nice
amber
colornot
much
head
retention
and
lite
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
feels
good
on
the
pallet
real
easy
beer
to
drink
and
finishs
smooth
i
first
heard
of
this
beer
on
the
history
channel
it
is
cheap
enough
at
eight
bucks
a
half
case
so
it
was
worth
a
try
ill
buy
some
more
soon
d
goes
down
very
easily
and
not
very
filling
but
not
much
flavor
at
all
i
was
on
vacation
and
this
was
the
only
beer
in
walmart
that
wasnt
made
by
ab
miller
coors
heiniken
or
corona
since
i
knew
i
couldnt
get
this
one
at
home
i
tried
but
wasnt
very
impressed
overall
not
very
good
drinkable
because
it
has
very
little
constitution
about
it
maybe
with
something
subtle
like
sushi
in
lieu
of
sapporo
or
kirin
ichiban
the
age
of
the
brewery
oldest
in
the
us
is
by
far
the
most
impressive
thing
about
this
beer
sadly
drinkability
what
can
i
say
its
and
old
school
lager
that
will
never
go
away
good
beer
was
interested
to
try
this
beer
as
it
is
advertised
as
americas
original
or
oldest
lager
not
terribly
impressed
however
and
i
think
the
green
bottle
adds
to
a
slight
skunking
of
the
beer
tasted
like
a
typical
american
macro
lager
not
much
now
to
add
i
think
id
order
a
bud
over
this
in
the
future
though
d
pretty
drinkable
especially
if
you
are
a
little
short
on
cash
i
have
beer
born
and
raised
in
wilkesbarre
pa
about
45
minutes
from
the
yuengilng
brewery
in
pottsville
but
tonight
was
the
first
time
i
actually
tried
it
and
i
have
to
say
im
impressed
being
in
college
i
mostly
drink
the
decent
locally
brewed
lionshead
for
10
a
case
but
tonight
for
some
reason
i
decided
to
get
a
sixer
of
this
at
the
local
pizza
store
pours
a
gorgeus
amber
color
though
has
a
less
than
impressive
smell
i
would
expect
a
richer
smell
because
of
the
color
but
i
didnt
give
up
on
it
yet
it
pours
a
good
2
head
at
first
and
dissipates
to
about
a
half
a
centimeter
in
a
few
minutes
i
swirled
it
around
and
found
the
lacing
to
be
more
than
average
but
not
extraordinary
has
a
malty
taste
but
finishes
very
clean
all
over
the
pallet
not
as
wattery
as
bmc
but
just
a
little
thicker
it
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
utterly
drinkable
and
i
eagerly
look
forward
to
buying
a
case
of
this
and
enjoying
it
ill
still
bust
out
the
lhead
for
partys
but
yuenging
is
just
for
me
i
absolutly
love
this
beer
notesthis
is
not
a
beer
to
choose
if
you
are
looking
for
a
really
complex
or
highquality
handcrafted
brew
if
you
just
want
something
to
drink
while
you
are
watching
a
favorite
team
playi
think
its
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
beer
it
always
makes
me
laugh
when
i
see
this
one
in
a
prepackaged
microbrew
assortment
this
beer
suddenly
got
popular
in
the
northeast
about
three
years
or
so
ago
even
in
townie
bars
you
can
usually
find
it
this
is
really
considered
the
best
of
the
best
for
some
nonbas
i
used
to
think
it
was
the
top
of
the
line
but
frankly
that
was
before
i
knew
anything
about
good
beer
not
to
cast
aspersions
in
any
direction
its
a
decent
brew
relatively
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
its
like
the
top
of
the
lowtier
of
beers
my
goto
icantaffordmicrobrewsrightnow
session
beer
d
solid
lager
hadnt
been
able
to
get
it
being
in
new
england
happy
that
my
buddy
brought
me
back
a
six
pack
easy
drinking
opinion
this
is
a
really
clean
beer
it
is
pretty
good
and
i
like
the
balance
you
get
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
for
the
most
part
the
beer
is
just
really
drinkable
if
it
was
local
i
would
drink
it
quite
frequently
but
since
it
is
so
hard
to
obtain
i
will
just
partake
in
it
whenever
it
is
convenient
drinkabiility
is
pretty
good
this
is
quite
quaffable
the
carbonation
is
light
light
to
medium
bodied
usually
leaves
a
slight
tangy
aftertaste
this
is
an
easydrinking
everyday
choice
that
is
quality
in
a
can
for
fishing
trips
not
bad
in
the
green
bottle
but
i
stick
away
from
the
draft
this
is
the
first
serious
beer
i
drank
while
attending
college
and
it
certainly
has
influenced
my
taste
in
beers
since
then
its
starting
to
be
found
very
commonly
in
the
midatlantic
and
i
find
it
goes
great
with
any
heavier
meal
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
a
solid
choice
that
can
be
easily
found
d
ill
only
drink
this
from
the
bottle
if
i
have
one
at
all
now
drinking
from
a
pint
glass
just
fills
my
senses
with
bad
noise
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
i
love
the
taste
and
i
love
the
look
of
it
it
is
a
lager
and
it
shows
the
color
is
great
the
head
is
always
there
and
the
taste
is
exceptional
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
in
the
area
i
just
wish
it
was
available
other
places
i
travel
to
drinkability
not
nearly
as
flavorless
as
other
macro
lagers
it
actually
has
a
little
character
to
it
quite
drinkable
unremarkable
yellowishbrown
with
huge
bubbles
in
the
offwhite
head
and
moderate
carbonation
toostrong
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
sulphur
define
the
smell
and
taste
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
adding
to
the
latter
lacks
depth
and
doesnt
make
up
for
it
with
pleasant
flavors
i
wonder
if
this
bottles
gone
bad
because
i
dont
remember
yuengling
beiing
this
unpleasant
back
in
college
pours
a
deep
copper
breadcrust
mixed
nicely
with
volcanic
bubbles
ascending
to
the
surface
about
one
and
a
half
finger
head
with
a
thick
foam
a
slightly
placid
malt
aroma
and
light
bitterness
seeping
around
at
the
end
of
my
nostrils
the
malts
really
permeates
my
sinus
even
light
amber
malts
give
a
hint
of
bittersweet
mixed
with
pellets
of
undesdinguishable
pellets
of
hops
pours
a
light
brownish
color
with
little
head
retention
or
lacingfrom
a
bottle
into
a
mug
smells
like
a
lager
malty
sharp
crisp
the
light
malt
taste
matches
the
smell
and
is
followed
by
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
this
beer
has
a
lighter
body
to
it
with
a
fairly
good
amount
of
carbonation
crisp
overall
a
good
beer
and
can
be
found
at
a
very
good
price
meh
hard
to
beat
for
the
price
and
serves
its
purpose
as
a
utility
beer
still
i
dont
really
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
simple
easy
drinkin
beer
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
bought
myself
at
a
grocery
store
no
less
since
ive
moved
from
mass
to
north
carolina
now
to
visit
the
real
beer
stores
and
kick
it
up
a
notch
americas
oldest
brewery
makes
a
great
offering
poured
out
a
nice
light
brownish
amber
color
from
the
emerald
green
bottle
nice
clean
white
head
which
lasted
for
a
while
no
real
lacing
present
smells
sharp
with
sweet
maltness
light
sweet
maltness
in
the
taste
as
well
hints
of
caramel
or
slight
roastiness
soft
hop
finish
smooth
all
around
nice
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
great
summertime
brew
get
it
for
any
cookout
especially
a
clam
bake
makes
for
a
great
dish
of
steamers
substitue
for
the
water
tasty
inexpensive
beer
that
i
enjoy
everytime
i
hit
the
lower
states
of
the
east
coast
i
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
around
new
england
good
overall
qualities
and
enjoyable
when
its
not
fresh
the
hops
seem
to
loose
out
to
sweet
cardboard
flavours
it
pours
a
golden
but
not
quite
amber
color
clear
with
good
head
formation
smell
is
of
malt
grains
and
corny
dms
taste
is
similar
and
no
hop
bitterness
is
detected
its
lightbodied
and
crisp
the
finish
is
mildly
astringent
but
otherwise
theres
no
complaints
with
this
one
and
at
this
point
im
used
to
it
anyway
am
i
biased
hell
yeah
drinkability
is
outfreakinstanding
md
drinkable
as
a
party
beer
wouldnt
make
a
good
session
beer
imo
a
very
simple
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
lager
nice
light
amber
color
nothing
particularly
remarkable
about
the
flavor
enjoyable
but
mild
very
beer
tasting
miles
above
american
macrobrews
but
still
a
few
clicks
below
the
more
famous
american
craft
beers
with
a
little
more
character
this
could
go
from
average
to
excellent
smell
bring
the
beer
to
your
nose
note
the
i
cant
get
yuengling
locally
but
stock
up
thanks
to
the
kindness
of
family
members
this
is
a
solid
lager
beer
with
a
long
and
storied
history
i
think
the
fact
that
it
is
still
family
owned
warrants
patronage
it
has
enough
body
and
character
to
distinguish
itself
from
macros
for
we
beer
snobs
its
not
going
to
set
the
world
on
fire
when
scrutinized
at
a
tasting
but
damn
it
its
a
very
affordable
good
lager
beer
that
is
american
owned
and
operated
drink
1
or
2
when
its
available
and
bask
in
your
patriotism
this
is
my
first
yuengling
and
i
must
admit
i
was
quite
excited
to
try
it
it
poured
an
orange
bronze
colour
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
faded
away
in
a
few
seconds
leaving
only
a
haze
of
white
several
streams
of
bubble
consistently
streamed
upwards
keeping
the
foam
blanket
alive
looks
pretty
good
smell
was
sugary
sweet
malts
and
grainy
corn
thats
just
what
i
got
from
it
i
was
a
bit
displeased
with
this
as
the
grainy
corn
smell
is
generally
to
be
expected
in
brews
of
lower
quality
imo
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
one
i
suppose
taste
was
malty
with
little
hops
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
sourness
on
this
finish
if
youre
looking
for
it
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
a
bit
more
weight
than
i
was
expecting
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
this
may
be
the
nations
oldest
brewery
with
some
fantastic
history
behind
it
but
it
just
isnt
for
me
id
drink
it
again
if
offered
by
some
one
but
really
i
didnt
care
for
it
c
while
nothing
in
particular
stood
out
to
wow
me
it
was
clean
and
refreshing
and
had
some
body
to
it
it
was
a
good
thirstquencher
if
nothing
else
at
five
bucks
for
a
sixpack
its
a
good
value
for
a
session
choice
its
better
cold
when
it
warms
it
has
a
bit
of
an
odd
aftertaste
drinkability
a
decent
quaffer
not
much
flavor
but
refreshing
the
same
way
water
is
refreshing
this
has
been
much
appreciated
when
the
only
alternatives
are
bmc
im
surprised
i
hadnt
reviewed
it
yet
tailgate
burgers
in
hand
my
brotherinlaw
and
i
went
through
a
six
pack
before
a
ravens
game
before
we
knew
it
truly
a
oneofakind
hybrid
between
a
drinkable
macro
and
a
complex
full
bodied
micro
like
on
the
utz
potato
chips
ad
people
who
cant
get
yuengling
are
probably
screaming
why
why
that
is
if
they
know
what
theyre
missing
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
very
thin
bodied
the
beer
is
loaded
with
fizzy
carbonation
the
beer
is
highly
quaffable
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
very
inoffensive
and
could
be
a
fairly
boring
session
beer
drinkablity
is
high
on
price
exceptional
in
bottles
i
did
say
at
the
bottle
price
i
thought
it
was
too
much
but
now
i
got
a
case
of
15
22oz
bombers
for
18
99
and
its
now
my
cheapie
of
choice
for
macro
lagers
this
is
the
best
domestic
lager
in
my
opinion
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
i
thought
it
would
be
just
another
macros
attempt
at
getting
into
the
micro
market
with
a
bland
beer
that
has
a
cool
name
like
killians
nope
not
even
close
the
flavors
while
not
too
complex
were
excellent
if
you
ever
find
yourself
in
a
market
devoid
of
craft
brew
search
this
one
out
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
descent
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
the
aroma
is
malt
driven
with
notes
of
caramel
and
biscuit
there
is
also
a
slight
floral
hops
presence
the
flavor
is
similar
with
malty
notes
of
caramel
and
biscuit
along
with
some
floral
and
mineraly
hops
and
some
slight
fruity
esters
that
are
a
bit
uncharacteristic
for
a
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
good
a
solid
amber
lager
drinkable
and
moderately
complex
ive
probably
had
more
yuengling
than
any
other
beer
always
a
good
backup
beer
or
just
to
save
some
money
ive
had
it
both
straight
from
the
bottle
and
also
poured
into
a
stein
and
neither
impressed
me
much
its
an
average
looking
lager
if
looks
are
important
to
you
a
moderate
amount
of
head
about
a
half
inch
but
it
dissipates
quickly
with
very
little
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
but
nothing
amazing
a
bit
sweet
the
flavor
is
not
my
favorite
i
understand
american
amber
lagers
arent
supposed
to
be
bitter
but
this
just
did
not
appeal
to
me
at
all
its
a
sweet
beer
with
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
mixed
in
its
like
drinking
a
strange
vegetable
a
definite
hoppy
aftertaste
ill
finish
the
sixpack
but
i
wont
buy
another
not
impressed
drinkability
easy
to
drink
like
a
traditional
beer
should
be
and
easy
enough
on
the
wallet
reminds
me
of
my
college
days
in
psu
drinkablity
good
i
would
have
had
another
but
ran
out
of
time
like
i
said
before
not
my
favorite
or
the
best
ive
had
but
id
drink
it
overall
a
tasty
beer
seems
it
could
go
well
with
lots
of
food
or
used
for
a
session
not
an
incredible
beer
but
quite
enjoyable
i
remember
when
this
first
came
out
in
pennsylvania
i
thought
this
was
very
good
beer
nõw
lets
transport
to
today
and
this
beer
really
isnt
that
good
far
better
than
than
the
bmc
macro
swill
but
other
than
running
to
the
mobil
mart
late
at
night
for
beer
i
can
think
of
a
reason
to
buy
this
but
dont
get
me
wrong
i
drink
this
on
occasion
and
im
not
bothered
by
that
compared
to
the
competition
this
beer
is
wonderful
this
has
become
my
fall
back
beer
in
huntsville
d
nice
light
and
easy
to
drink
prefered
over
bmc
for
esoteric
reasons
and
for
slightly
bulked
up
taste
picked
up
a
six
pack
when
i
was
in
north
carolina
this
is
a
solid
amber
lager
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
bad
either
i
put
this
on
par
with
something
like
shiner
cheap
if
you
are
in
the
area
widely
available
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
the
bmc
offerings
it
is
usually
surrounded
by
a
light
copper
color
with
hints
of
a
golden
hue
the
aroma
of
bread
and
some
spicy
hops
are
the
most
prevalent
scents
the
taste
starts
with
the
malt
which
give
it
a
mild
flavor
then
a
nice
hop
finish
comes
in
that
lasts
for
some
time
in
the
mouth
it
feels
watery
at
the
beginning
and
gain
some
weoght
as
it
reaches
the
back
of
the
palate
there
is
also
a
strong
sensation
of
carbonation
in
every
swallow
drinkability
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
refreshing
for
me
though
it
is
not
something
i
would
grab
consistantly
what
this
beer
really
has
going
for
it
is
its
drinkability
definitely
a
solid
session
beer
at
a
cheap
price
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
even
with
a
bigger
than
average
for
style
feel
it
goes
down
quickly
and
smoothly
id
easily
drink
this
again
if
im
ever
in
pennsylvania
like
i
said
it
isnt
a
super
amazing
beer
but
i
can
count
on
it
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
and
like
all
things
in
life
sometimes
tradition
and
pride
are
more
important
than
the
details
more
on
the
beer
it
looks
good
and
smells
good
and
can
be
used
to
compliment
a
meal
or
in
a
game
of
beer
pong
really
this
beer
works
as
a
good
beer
with
friends
and
a
good
beer
to
share
pours
a
clear
golden
color
12
inch
head
of
medium
to
small
bubbles
aroma
is
grassy
and
earthy
taste
is
clean
and
light
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
and
then
fades
into
a
lightly
bitter
finish
for
an
american
macro
lager
ill
take
it
any
day
of
the
week
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
every
day
beer
a
staple
in
my
fridge
in
the
summer
very
good
for
what
it
is
much
better
than
your
average
bmc
not
a
strong
taste
but
enough
there
to
appreciate
its
quality
i
salute
pa
for
making
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
i
was
interested
to
drink
this
cause
its
very
hard
to
acquire
where
i
live
that
turned
out
to
be
a
good
thing
this
counts
as
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
bitter
grain
and
slender
amber
malt
a
little
bitterness
washed
down
with
a
kind
of
skunk
sweetness
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
the
lager
after
looking
and
the
meek
color
i
already
had
a
good
feel
for
what
it
will
taste
like
the
nose
didnt
give
off
much
but
a
wiff
of
steel
almost
like
i
had
poured
it
out
of
a
can
odd
you
would
think
this
being
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
nation
they
would
have
picked
up
a
few
good
ideas
over
the
years
when
you
want
a
good
tasting
cheap
beer
this
works
i
prefer
the
black
tan
to
this
so
i
agree
this
is
a
beer
to
take
out
fishing
mowing
the
lawn
or
washing
your
car
theres
not
a
strong
hop
taste
or
smell
amber
coloring
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
being
from
pa
i
have
this
fairly
often
and
will
continue
to
clear
copper
color
head
fades
fast
smell
is
grainy
and
a
little
sweet
taste
is
not
that
great
too
sweet
not
enough
hops
or
much
at
all
a
bland
lager
one
not
worth
the
hype
that
most
people
get
it
i
prefer
the
second
oldest
brewery
any
day
of
the
week
pours
an
orangetinged
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
with
little
lacing
little
in
the
way
of
smell
that
i
can
detect
flavor
is
a
welcome
change
from
the
usual
macro
offerings
a
little
too
sweet
in
the
flavor
department
crisp
lager
finish
mouthfeel
is
better
than
most
macro
lagers
but
still
a
little
thin
leaves
me
wishing
for
more
substance
that
said
this
is
a
good
standby
beer
especially
in
florida
where
its
the
same
price
as
bud
d
well
its
a
step
above
your
standard
american
macro
lagers
actually
has
a
bit
of
body
malt
presence
tastes
like
the
beer
your
grandaddy
let
you
sip
when
you
were
a
kid
very
much
a
lawnmower
beer
its
all
over
the
northeast
us
and
deserves
some
credit
for
its
longevity
and
body
seems
like
a
fairly
typical
aml
no
real
average
qualities
darn
i
attend
college
in
ny
so
this
stuff
is
everywhere
on
campus
automatic
points
are
given
because
this
is
the
uss
oldest
brewery
when
poured
into
a
glass
it
looks
alot
like
other
us
macro
lagers
only
a
bit
darker
there
the
smell
hints
towards
citrusy
hops
and
an
apple
like
smell
flavor
backs
this
up
very
flavorful
for
a
us
macro
lager
leaves
alittle
bit
of
residue
on
the
lips
and
teeth
not
as
clean
as
better
brews
this
beer
is
very
affordable
and
is
nice
for
a
long
night
of
drinking
nice
slightly
darker
golden
sort
of
color
decent
enough
head
at
first
pour
ok
aromasort
of
sulfury
and
just
beer
like
good
malty
flavor
with
a
great
hop
bite
to
it
i
am
a
huge
bud
fan
and
this
has
the
same
great
snap
that
i
find
in
a
bud
theres
a
nice
grainy
flavor
going
on
as
well
good
body
for
style
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
umph
then
your
standard
us
macro
i
like
it
being
from
pa
yuengling
is
my
beer
of
choice
when
im
out
at
the
bar
or
if
i
just
want
to
enjoy
a
nice
lager
at
home
the
color
is
ambercopper
and
the
head
was
about
average
size
and
consistancy
the
smell
is
a
little
bit
creamy
and
hoppy
with
a
nice
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
slight
creaminess
with
a
normal
amount
of
bitterness
for
a
lager
the
taste
is
fullbodied
and
finishes
strong
to
the
end
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
not
overly
fizzy
i
find
yuengling
lager
to
be
quite
drinkable
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
wellbrewed
lager
if
available
in
your
area
this
should
be
your
first
choice
for
a
very
reasonably
priced
lager
im
a
big
fan
of
the
yuengling
bros
brewery
so
i
drink
what
they
got
anytime
i
find
my
self
in
the
situation
nice
fresh
beer
maybe
a
half
inch
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
but
did
not
entirely
leave
beautiful
medium
color
with
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
bitter
with
no
sign
of
sweetness
tastes
like
it
curled
up
on
my
tongue
and
gave
me
a
hug
smells
like
it
looks
poured
a
clear
goldenamber
with
a
quarter
inch
head
of
off
white
foam
that
stayed
smell
is
clean
and
mainly
of
the
malt
hint
of
adjunct
slight
metallic
character
taste
is
of
the
slightly
sweet
malt
at
first
kinda
creamy
some
grassycitrus
hop
tinge
also
a
hint
of
metal
mouthfeel
is
light
but
slightly
creamy
one
of
my
standby
brews
sold
at
every
convience
store
around
my
area
much
better
than
most
of
the
other
macros
in
my
opinion
a
very
drinkable
american
redamber
lager
from
the
tap
at
parrot
key
in
fort
meyers
poured
a
golden
copper
with
a
off
white
head
aroma
hard
to
tell
had
the
aroma
of
the
water
coming
in
since
this
retaurant
was
near
a
marina
that
was
near
the
gulf
of
mexico
malts
hops
some
sugar
grains
flavor
the
malts
came
out
pretty
goodat
first
than
dropped
off
as
it
warmed
got
some
sourness
and
a
bite
of
hops
at
the
finish
but
did
go
well
with
my
fresh
florida
mahimahi
sandwich
i
had
on
a
recent
visit
to
tampa
every
bar
i
went
to
had
this
on
draft
i
was
told
that
yuengling
had
a
brewery
in
tampa
is
this
the
only
beer
they
brew
anyway
it
was
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
good
lacing
it
had
a
sweet
fresh
corn
odor
but
not
much
taste
there
was
a
little
hops
but
that
was
about
it
pretty
average
this
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
aroma
was
sweet
and
malty
on
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
corn
adjunct
taste
was
also
sweet
with
a
slight
hop
flavor
the
beer
was
very
smooth
in
the
finish
but
had
that
adjunct
flavor
that
macros
tend
to
have
i
thought
this
beer
was
supposed
to
be
all
malt
its
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
tad
more
flavor
than
bmc
but
not
much
else
i
dont
understand
all
the
hoopla
behind
this
beer
im
not
gonna
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
this
out
again
ill
stick
with
yuengling
porter
instead
cheers
had
a
pint
on
tap
this
beer
had
a
nice
color
for
a
lager
almost
a
copper
color
the
smell
was
typical
for
a
macro
type
lager
tastes
pretty
decent
id
rather
drink
this
than
most
macros
it
does
have
a
little
more
sweetness
than
im
used
to
though
not
bad
for
a
lager
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
a
good
macrobrew
not
on
the
level
of
sam
adams
but
the
flavor
may
be
more
appealing
to
mainstream
america
than
sam
as
well
although
i
prefer
sam
adams
this
isnt
a
bad
one
to
fall
back
on
taste
is
not
impressive
decent
amount
of
flavor
but
i
think
i
detect
corn
or
some
other
adjunct
mouthfeel
is
smooth
moderate
carbonation
ill
pass
on
having
another
one
got
a
12pk
of
these
for
9
99
appearance
is
copper
in
color
with
an
ok
head
no
lacing
to
speak
off
smell
is
not
the
best
a
little
sour
and
hints
of
fruit
the
taste
however
is
pretty
good
has
a
little
fruit
coming
out
with
some
maltiness
as
well
its
a
crisp
beer
but
not
that
bitter
basically
for
someone
who
feels
bud
is
a
beer
wo
a
lot
of
flavor
id
recommend
trying
this
instead
drinkability
is
good
as
i
could
easily
spend
a
night
drinking
just
these
its
certainly
not
bad
just
certainly
not
good
either
the
look
is
completely
average
it
has
almost
no
smell
and
tastes
watered
down
and
too
bready
pours
a
copper
color
with
decent
head
not
a
very
pleasent
smell
mostly
consists
of
citrus
fruits
and
sour
malts
the
slight
citrus
scent
carries
over
to
the
flavor
where
the
citrus
flavors
mingle
with
the
typical
lager
maltiness
and
finishes
up
with
a
bit
of

not
at
all
a
bad
brew
this
is
a
good
brew
to
have
when
you
have
a
few
friends
over
that
are
afriad
to
venture
to
far
from
macro
brews

so
is

another
hot
summer
day
beer
served
very
cold
with
a

sandwich
and
a
white
owl
cigar
that
might
work
yuengling
is
a
beer
ill
choose
if
im
out
and
the
other
taps
are
all
bmc
thanks
too
a
market
blitz
by
yuengling
in
the
last
3
years
this
stuff
is
everywhere
in
my
area
highly
carbonated
with
a
goldenamber
color
perfectly
clear
decent
head
retention
thin
flavor
almost
surprising
given
the
color
you
might
expect
a
little
more
body
from
this
beer
too
bad
nothing
really
wrong
with
yuengling
it
could
just
be
better
this
is
a
real
easydrinking
beer
and
very
refreshing
when
you
need
one
yuengling
traditional
lager
will
always
be
my
default
beer
drinkability
well
this
is
basically
my
fall
back
beer
so
i
have
to
give
it
high
marks
for
that
but
experience
has
shown
me
that
having
too
many
yuengs
can
really
fill
you
up
like
no
other
beer
ive
ever
had
this
should
have
a
huge
drinkability
score
but
i
just
cant
bring
myself
to
it
yeah
for
a
while
i
drank
lots
of
this
but
the
last
time
i
had
some
it
just
struck
me
as
unpleasant
to
drink
unimpressive
head
to
start
out
and
doesnt
last
but
a
few
seconds
probably
leads
to
the
lack
of
a
convincing
boquet
which
sweeter
and
strangely
echoes
scents
of
mushrooms
color
is
a
solid
golden
amber
color
which
is
probably
its
best
feature
carbonation
is
moderately
tight
taste
is
very
grainy
but
worth
your
while
leaves
a
warm
morningbreath
like
feel
in
your
mouth
which
is
unpleasant
but
little
aftertaste
a
good
beer
for
relaxing
with
friends
nice
light
amber
color
but
the
head
rapidly
dissipated
the
aroma
is
clean
with
a
faint
hint
of
caramel
and
graininess
the
flavor
is
a
bit
subdued
featuring
a
touch
of
maltiness
and
some
balancing
hop
bitterness
but
very
little
else
in
the
way
of
flavor
the
overall
impression
is
dryness
and
a
crisp
blend
of
light
malt
and
hops
overall
this
is
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
usual
macroswill
but
its
got
a
long
way
to
go
to
deserve
premium
or
at
least
what
i
expect
from
premium
this
is
my
first
review
because
this
is
my
favorite
beer
at
this
point
i
know
about
where
the
quality
of
this
brew
is
which
is
good
but
not
superlative
it
does
pass
the
only
two
quality
tests
i
know
of
though
if
you
serve
it
warm
it
still
tastes
fine
and
theres
not
a
beer
ive
ever
tried
that
will
make
the
taste
of
yuengling
traditional
suffer
if
you
try
them
head
to
head
the
reason
why
it
still
stands
up
as
my
favorite
is
because
ive
got
moderate
taste
and
because
this
is
my
goto
beer
it
is
pretty
good
at
everything
in
my
opinion
you
can
use
this
as
a
session
beer
you
can
drink
it
with
food
you
can
drink
it
on
a
hot
day
theres
no
time
i
can
think
of
where
you
might
want
a
beer
where
you
could
go
wrong
with
yuengling
traditional
lager
that
said
i
think
its
hard
to
beat
the
appearance
in
the
green
bottle
no
problem
with
skunking
for
me
since
i
live
less
than
a
days
drive
from
the
brewery
the
contrast
of
green
bottle
and
dark
lager
is
pleasing
its
head
is
not
reliable
but
reaches
a
respectable
size
when
it
does
form
and
it
does
usually
leave
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
about
what
a
beer
should
smell
like
yeasty
and
malty
with
some
tang
from
the
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
same
malt
and
some
noticable
yeast
it
tends
more
towards
sweet
than
bitter
but
there
is
little
bitter
there
for
balance
the
most
consistent
notes
i
detect
is
a
little
grass
and
maybe
a
really
faint
bit
of
citrus
one
of
my
favorite
things
about
yuengling
traditional
lager
are
the
hops
they
use
i
dont
know
the
variety
but
they
are
one
of
my
favorites
because
they
add
an
interesting
and
fairly
complex
flavor
without
excessive
bitterness
something
few
beers
do
for
some
reason
the
taste
seems
to
be
more
pronounced
in
the
bottle
the
aroma
and
more
suble
taste
aspects
of
the
hops
can
dissapate
in
a
pint
glass
sometimes
also
i
notice
at
least
one
person
ahead
of
me
said
this
has
no
adjunct
ingredients
im
not
sure
this
is
true

there
are
added

id
say
this

fits
better
in
the
premium
american

category
competing
against
the
likes
of
michelob
this
is
a
decent

taste
is
crisp

with
no

the
malts
are
highquality
and
the
taste
reflects
that
a
bit
more
body
then
a
macro
and
that
lager
flavor
is
perfectly
balanced
in
the
beer
not
a
whole
lot
of
depth
though
but
i
guess
that
cannot
be
expected
in
an
american
lager
a
good
beer
to
drink
during
a
summer
barbeque
with
friends
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
and

very
easy

to
one
like
myself

this
is
a
truly
classic
american
beer
an
obvious
interpretation
of
the
classic
european
prepilsner
lager
style
beersyuengling
has
been
in
business
since
1829
13
years
before
the
pilsner
style
first
appeared
it
has
a
feel
that
the
big
megabrewers
simply
have
been
unable
to
capture
my
only
disappointment
with
yuengling
is
that
its
not
available
in
illinois
drinkability
i
can
put
these
down
i
will
say
this
though
after
a
couple
of
them
they
start
to
taste
boring
but
thats
never
stopped
me
the
upside
is
that
the
bottle
is
easy
to
drain
and
the
strong
carbonation
makes
for
a
refreshing
feel
if
the
flavour
were
more
interesting
i
would
have
been
happy
to
drink
many
more
what
can
you
say
its
a
good
straightforward
drink
with
a
sandwich
or
buddy
beer
nice
slightly

perhaps
a
little
lackingflat
in
the
body
department
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
else
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
higher
end
larger
volume
lagers
available
and
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
while
it
wont
blow
you
away
you
wont
be
disappointed
especially
under

for

cant

yuengling
brew
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
seems
to
be
a
mix
of
corn
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
very
clean
sweet
caramel
that
finishes
smoothly
much
more
flavor
than
most
lagers

the

lager
nothing
big
just

reasonable
price
nice
amber
color
on
this
beer
with
a

head
decent

aroma
is
citric
and
corny
taste
comes
off
that
way
as
well
its
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
corn
syrup
like
sweetness
and
nice
base
of
grains
and
yeast
flavor
hops
are
very
mild
but
finish
off
the
beer
nicely
this
really
reminds
me
of
high
life
expect
with
a
creamier
more
substantial
body
a
great
cheap
drinking
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
solid
copper
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
doesnt
seen
to
want
to
leave
the
nose
is
slightly
honey
touched
caramel
this
smells
really
nice
the
flavor
is
rather
full
with
a
sweet
honey
caramel
mix
that
moves
to
a
really
crisp
just
ever
so
slightly
grainey
finish
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
really
nice
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
nice
refreshing
and
full
of
flavor
how
nice
pours
out
amber
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
a
surprising
amount
of
lace
smell
is
sort
of
understated
theres
some
malt
in
there
and
a
little
off
note
thats
somewhat
metallic
tastes
like
lager
sweet
malt
hits
you
pretty
hard
but
it
gives
way
to
a
very
faint
hop
bitterness
and
a
sort
of
nutty
finish
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
even
for
the
style
overall
you
really
cant
beat
this
one
for
the
money
its
way
too
cheap
to
be
this
good
and
blows
everything
else
at
comparable
prices
flat
out
of
the
water
one
of
my
favorite
things
about
living
in
philly
is
that
you
can
always
just
ask
for
a
lager
and
get
a
cheap
decent
pint
well
i
must
confess
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
yuengling
and
i
know
very
little
about
it
so
i
was
delightfully
surprised
when
i
poured
this
into
the
glass
and
it
was
a
light
amber
color
with
a
solid
white
head
the
aroma
was
nice
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
as
it
warmed
with
a
bready
yeast
aroma
that
bordered
on
a
bock
yeast
aroma
the
flavor
was
clean
not
overly
bitter
with
caramel
malt
and
toasted
bread
giving
way
to
a
yeasty
aftertaste
the
beer
had
plenty
of
body
for
the
style
and
it
was
clearly
the
best
beer
i
had
on
this
little
trip
to
florida
pours
nicely
with
a
thin
lace
and
beautiful
amber
color
the
smell
is
fairly
nondescript
and
the
flavour
is
too
almost
a
doughy
taste
with
metallic
tinges
although
unoffensive
it
is
a
solid
beer
and
hence
very
drinkable
around
here
this
is
about
as
cheap
as
water
so
theres
no
decision
to
be
made
when
you
want
an
refreshing
and
lazy
summer
day
brew
amber
with
a
faint
white
head
the
nose
is
slightly
sweet
perhaps
a
bit
cherryish
but
otherwise
not
really
distinctive
a
slight
hoppiness
works
to
tone
down
the
sweetness
of
the
flavor
which
is
also
not
especially
noteworthy
a
crisp
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
drinkable
drinkability
one
could
definitely
drink
this
all
night
long
its
also
cheap
as
hell
for
a
12
pack
somewhere
in
the
8
range
choosing
this
over
similarly
priced
beer
is
a
nobrainer
probably
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
beer
you
can
get
definitely
buy
and
consume
many
of
these
brews
notes
this
has
always
been
a
popular
one
with
my
family
i
can
see
why
its
cheap
and
nonoffensive
this
beer
is
simple
goodness
but
by
no
means
a
standout
besides
sam
adams
this
is
the
best
session
beer
you
can
find
available
in
most
places
in
the
area
will
always
beat
bmc

or

great

one
of
the

this

and
some

light

a

of

and
little

taste
is

slightly
bitter
with
a
shortlived
bready
finish
easy
to
drink
because
theres
nothing
much
to
it
but
it
sure
is
better
than
anything
else
offered
on
tap
at
olive
garden
bud
bud
light
and
coors
light
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
a
good
beer
when
you
match
quality
with
cost
and
its
a
great
beer
to
start
your
friends
out
on
when
you
trying
to
get
them
away
from
the
aforementioned
macros
and
its
good
for
when
you
come
in
from
mowing
the
lawn
when
its
ninety
degrees
and
humid
out
and
all
you
want
to
do
it
pound
a
really
cold
one
im
too
poor
to
afford
cheap
micros
and
imports
as
everyday
beers
so
this
is
my
everyday
beer
really
if
i
were
a
richer
man
id
probably
still
be
drinking
yuengling
for
bbqs
lawn
mowing
fishing
or
just
watching
movies
with
friends
its
perfect
for
all
those
12
oz
with
no
freshness
date
pours
an
amberorange
color
with
a
1
finger
head
and
almost
no
lacing
has
a
metallic
scent
accompanied
by
grains
and
hops
in
the
background
it
has
a
crisp
carbonation
and
the
taste
is
malt
and
grains
with
a
slight
hop
twang
mouthfeel
is
good
and
goes
down
smooth
has
a
high
drinkability
you
can
almost
pound
it
like
you
would
a
light
macro
lager
the
only
reason
it
loses
points
on
drinkability
is
that
it
fills
you
up
quickly
the
thing
about
yuengling
is
sometimes
you
get
a
skunked
batch
lightstrunk
green
bottles
is
my
guess
which
i
think
was
the
case
in
this
review
go
for
the
12pack
or
a
22
oz
which
has
brown
glass
rather
than
the
6pack
to
avoid
this
the
unskunked
has
more
hop
flavor
and
better
mouthfeel
regardless
it
always
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
and
for
the
price
as
cheap
or
cheaper
than
budweiser
bottles
you
wont
find
much
better
of
any
style
great
session
beer
living
in
pa
is
a
plus
since
most
batches
delivered
are
bottled
the
same
day
taste
is
again
very
lightly
fruity
mixed
with
the
grassy
malt
biscuity
with
perceptable
hops
in
the
finish
lightly
sweet
and
a
tad
sticky
in
the
mouth
creamy
and
smooth
an
easy
drinking
sitbackandwatchthegame
beer
an
old
favorite
and
standby
i
like
the
light
amber
appearance
of
this
lager
lightly
carbonated
but
still
many
bubbles
floating
to
the
top
of
the
glass
ok
mouthfeel
with
small
laces
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
looks
very
good
for
a
cheap
american
lager
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
strange
side
i
think
it
is
a
little
sweet
and
could
use
a
little
more
hops
for
my
taste
because
of
the
sweetness
i
cant
drink
too
many
of
these
at
one
session
its
better
than
miller
or
bud
but
not
on
my
list
if
i
have
microbrews
or
homebrews
around
the
girls
love
it
probably
due
to
sweetness
so
there
is
some
real
value
to
have
it
around
at
parties
a
light
to
medium
amber
colored
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
everything
about
the
beer
is
very
safe
and
comfortable
to
me
part
of
it
is
because
i
grew
up
drinking
it
in
large
quantities
but
part
of
it
is
because
it
is
a
verstile
well
rounded
smooth
mouthfeel
beer
suitable
for
summer
days
while
mowing
the
lawn
or
for
winter
nights
while
hanging
out
with
freinds
and
playing
poker
sometimes
i
get
bottles
that
have
a
skunky
taste
but
not
tonight
sweet
maltiness
light
fruitness
and
a
dry
clean
finish
i
have
ran
into
yuengling
traditional
lager
many
times
in
my
days
poured
a
nice
rich
amber
color
with
decent
head
that
fell
within
minutes
the
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
and
a
little
bit
malty
you
can
taste
the
grains
in
this
one
with
a
nice
hoppy
bite
at
the
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
a
nice
carbonation
and
medium
body
as
for
the
drinkability
as
i
have
previously
stated
i
have
ran
into
this
beer
many
times
and
predict
that
i
will
do
so
many
more
times
in
the
future
first
sip
reveals
average
carbonation
and
average
body
maybe
even
a
little
lite
flavor
is
clean
and
crisp
with
some
grainy
malt
providing
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
as
well
the
beer
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
very
smooth
not
very
interesting
but
certainly
nice
on
a
hot
day
or
when
just
drinkin
brews
while
watchin
football
definitely
better
than
big
3
lagers
the
good
points
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
cheap
easily
found
in
the
extended
philadelphia
area
and
drinkable
if
needed
pours
light
amber
almost
watery
smells
like
old
hops
and
alcohol
a
little
skunky
taste
was
a
little
hoppy
with
some
wheat
notes
surprisingly
light
and
almost
refreshing
id
drink
it
at
a
bbq
or
something
overalla
fine
american
lager
not
that
many
amber
characteristics
but
its
smooth
and
crisp
definitely
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
just
below
sam
adams
for
me
but
its
above
a
great
many
other
beers
in
its
category
give
it
a
try
this
is
a
very
smooth
lighter
lager
a
nice
crisp
taste
that
goes
down
very
easy
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
for
a
first
time
i
would
defenitely
try
it
again
it
has
a
light
amber
color
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
to
sit
around
and
relax
with
friends
i
do
enjoy
this
and
will
drink
it
again
most
likely
when
options
are
thin
im
just
not
wild
about
lagers
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
plenty
of
taste
with
no
off
or
harsh
flavors
a
solid
brew
pours
a
light
yellow
amber
with
a
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
a
decent
malty
nose
with
some
light
hop
elements
taste
is
mainly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
light
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
chewy
medium
with
a
slickness
that
finishes
in
a
dryness
easy
enough
on
the
drinkability
scale
this
is
a
very
sought
after
beer
here
the
store
owners
always
complain
that
it
is
in
such
high
demand
yet
they
are
unable
to
have
it
distributed
to
them
i
agree
that
it
is
a
good
beer
but
like
the
gentleman
before
me
suggests
it
is
in
limbo
between
macro
and
micro
beers
it
does
have
a
very
pleasant
taste
and
virtually
no
aftertaste
it
is
reasonable
priced
as
well
i
do
wish
it
was
available
around
me
as
it
is
a
treat
to
get
when
i
can
amber
bodied
with
a
beigeish
head
smells
like
malts
and
hops
but
a
bit
of
yeast
personally
i
think
this
beer
tastes
pretty
awful
granted
its
not
as
bad
mbc
beers
but
i
think
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
tastes
below
average
couldnt
tell
you
why
but
i
think
it
tastes
much
better
out
of
a
can
i
seem
to
be
the
only
person
around
here
who
doesnt
like
it
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
light
and
for
me
this
is
just
not
a
drinkable
beer
based
on
the
fact
that
i
dont
enjoy
the
flavor
my
advice
go
grab
a
yuengling
porter
not
this
poured
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
that
settled
down
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
nice
bit
of
lacework
toasted
malts
in
the
nose
pleasant
aroma
just
slightly
malty
to
start
before
striking
a
perfect
balance
between
malt
and
hops
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
finish
is
nice
and
dry
for
a
cheaper
lager
too
many
cheap
lagers
finish
slick
and
sweet
a
pleasant
tartness
also
surfaces
after
the
finish
a
light
very
easy
drinkin
and
pleasant
lager
i
was
suprised
that
i
had
not
ever
heard
of
this
beer
before
i
went
to
college
at
one
point
one
of
my
roomates
showed
up
with
a
18
pack
of
cans
neither
i
nor
any
of
my
friends
had
ever
tried
this
stuff
but
im
not
one
to
turn
down
a
beer
so
i
went
for
it
when
poured
it
was
a
nice
reddish
orange
color
had
a
somewhat
caramel
color
head
which
dissappared
rather
quickly
excellent
flavor
best
american
beer
that
i
have
had
thus
far
price
was
pretty
good
also
which
supprised
me
for
the
flavor
that
it
had
edit
i
hadnt
had
yuengling
in
a
while
it
is
a
good
beer
still
my
fall
back
but
after
trying
so
many
others
it
doesnt
compare
as
well
i
wish
for
taste
there
was
a
3
75
option
because
some
of
my
4s
are
significantly
better
and
some
3
5s
are
worse
than
this
bottomline
ive
virtually
always
had
it
on
tap
from
pitchers
and
its
been
pretty
constant
if
you
want
a
dirtcheap
beer
thats
not
offensive
get
this
its
ohso
drinkable
the
quintessence
of
what
a
session
beer
should
be
when
youre
hitting
the
bars
or
playing
quizzo
in
phillie
pours
the
colour
of
iced
tea
minimal
head
aroma
is
not
much
maybe
a
bit
of
caramel
bread
but
thats
pushing
it
taste
is
smooth
more
malty
than
most
macros
sweet
taste
with
just
a
tough
of
dryness
at
the
finish
very
easy
drinking
not
very
carbonated
sweetnes
cuts
the
drinkability
however
for
a
macro
its
the
same
price
as
bud
and
so
much
better
now
i
ask
you
im
supposed
to
be
impressed
by
yuengling
because
of
what
i
was
raised
in
the
town
this
beer
is
brewed
and
ever
since
they
started
making
this
lager
their
production
has
increased
by
more
than
10
times
this
is
an
excellent
lager
with
a
great
taste
a
little
heavy
dont
want
to
drink
this
on
a
full
stomach
but
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
if
on
the
east
coast
you
got
to
give
this
one
a
try
take
the
brewery
tour
if
local
get
free
samples
of
all
their
brands
this
truly
is
a
world
class
beer
this
has
become
a
very
popular
beer
around
here
so
every
bar
and
restaraunt
has
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
smell
is
sweet
malt
taste
is
good
malty
and
slightly
sweet
with
not
nuch
else
going
on
very
drinkable
in
that
it
tastes
good
and
goes
down
easy
great
beer
for
the
all
day
picnic
it
is
also
nice
to
know
that
it
is
always
there
for
you
even
in
those
bar
that
only
carry
macro
crap
beers
presented
in
a
huge
24oz
shaker
glass
beige
14
head
which
had
little
retention
and
laced
okay
over
a
copper
brew
aroma
a
somewhat
generic
pale
malthops
aroma
taste
is
reasonably
wellbalanced
with
good
mouthfeel
drinkability
was
very
good
with
high
sessionability
a
pleasant
and
enjoyable
lager
this
beer
is
nice
to
have
when
youre
on
a
diet
of
primarily
busch
and
coors
light
but
given
that
typical
diet
its
also
hard
to
review
this
beer
with
a
pallate
that
is
so
out
of
shape
as
it
were
but
here
goes
anwyay
its
appearnce
is
a
rather
muted
brown
color
with
very
little
lustre
to
it
the
carbonation
bubbles
are
huge
and
the
head
is
almost
non
existant
leaving
no
lace
or
ring
the
smell
is
all
that
typical
lager
yeast
and
wheat
smell
reminds
me
alot
of
the
saranac
lager
actually
the
taste
is
not
offensive
but
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
it
either
definatley
the
wheats
again
with
a
hint
of
yeasts
but
not
much
hops
to
be
had
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
i
guess
im
predisposed
against
lagers
because
im
a
huge
hophead
but
all
in
all
this
isnt
actually
that
bad
since
yuengling
is
still
unavailable
in
massachusetts
i
make
sure
to
get
my
fill
of
it
when
i
visit
my
friends
and
family
in
new
jersey
whether
you
find
this
beer
average
or
highly
enjoyable
it
is
still
one
of
the
best
bangs
for
your
buck
in
the
tristate
area
16
bucks
for
a
case
at
the
local
liquor
store
here
in
fair
lawn
nj
im
bringing
back
at
least
2
cases
of
it
for
me
and
my
roommates
in
boston
what
do
you
drink
when
you
go
to
a
restaurant
and
theres
not
much
choice
other
than
the
same
old
same
old
this
was
an
amberred
beer
tiny
head
disapated
before
i
could
drink
it
more
carbonation
than
i
think
it
needed
nothing
that
i
could
really
smell
but
what
do
i
know
i
prefer
dark
and
stout
this
was
neither
and
they
had
neither
it
tasted
a
lot
like
beer
hoppy
grainy
and
slightly
bitter
did
i
think
it
was
drinkable
yeah
it
was
beer
i
would
have
rather
enjoyed
a
good
craft
brew
but
this
is
what
my
choice
was
it
was
just
as
it
was
scored
average
and
i
wasnt
impressed
final
thought
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
minimacro
beers
in
america
especially
for
the
pricetoquality
ratio
thanx
to
katie
for
providing
the
goods
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
yuengling
traditional
lager
but
i
was
sort
of
curious
to
see
what
americas
oldest
brewery
has
to
offer
if
anyone
offers
this
beer
to
me
in
the
future
ill
politely
decline
on
draught
at
the
rex
theatre
in
pittsburgh
not
a
bad
concert
beer
copper
colored
with
a
thin
white
head
very
little
lacing
light
aroma
of
hops
with
a
hint
of
malt
but
i
really
had
to
bury
my
nose
to
get
it
lightbodied
and
just
as
drinkable
and
smooth
as
the
bottled
version
flavors
of
hops
and
malt
are
muted
and
the
finish
is
smooth
and
lightly
bitter
not
a
lot
going
on
but
i
can
see
why
this
is
featured
so
much
in
the
region
a
great
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
tastes
great
for
the
price
youll
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
lager
for
hangin
with
the
guys
one
of
the
best
american
lagers
on
the
market
that
you
dont
have
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
i
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
to
get
if
i
have
nine
bucks
to
my
name
and
a
night
of
poker
with
the
guys
to
kill
dn
for
a
macro
this
ones
not
bad
at
all
i
picked
up
a
twelve
pack
to
take
to
my
skydiving
pals
and
this
seems
to
be
a
good
choice
for
that
relatively
cheap
widely
available
and
way
better
than
bud
perfect
picnic
fodder
when
you
just
want
to
have
a
beer
without
having
to
scribble
down
notes
for
a
review
a
bomber
with
a
twistoff
cap
orangey
amber
color
with
columns
of
bubbles
rising
quickly
to
the
top
a
light
beige
thick
head
rises
up
2
inches
high
and
drops
down
quickly
aroma
is
malty
a
bit
grapey
slightly
pungent
with
some
lemon
undertones
mouthfeel
is
light
and
tingly
crisp
and
dry
giving
way
to
flavors
of
malt
with
hints
of
pear
and
honey
not
much
more
complex
than
that
and
i
might
be
dreaming
the
pear
and
honey
a
22
oz
bottle
a
fine
looking
slightly
deep
looking
amber
nice
coloration
the
head
was
white
and
plentiful
on
the
initial
pouring
the
head
did
not
last
long
the
taste
is
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
there
is
a
crsip
finishjusts
as
desrribed
by
the
brewer
this
is
an
easy
to
find
beer
and
highly
drinkable
this
beer
like
most
lagers
that
i
have
experienced
is
much
better
on
draft
than
it
is
in
the
bottle
this
beer
was
a
richamber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
was
a
nice
mix
of
malts
and
hops
with
nothing
really
standing
out
either
way
the
taste
was
extremely
sweet
but
as
with
the
aroma
nothing
really
stands
out
the
malt
sweetness
was
a
tad
bit
overwhelming
as
there
really
was
little
if
any
trace
of
the
hops
bitterness
the
moderate
carbonation
made
this
pleasing
to
the
mouth
and
the
drinkability
high
unfortunately
as
a
whole
this
beer
is
just
about
average
and
there
was
nothing
really
drawing
about
it
on
to
the
review
the
appearance
was
good
in
my
opinion
dark
amber
clear
nice
foamy
white
head
that
clung
to
the
glass
i
admit
it
looked
good
the
smell
was
grainyherby
slightly
big
macro
like
although
i
did
detect
a
bit
of
hops
in
there
overall
not
bad
the
taste
was
grainy
as
well
this
is
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
taste
at
all
big
emphases
on
the
grains
not
too
much
happening
in
the
hop
department
again
like
the
smell
there
was
an
herby
earthy
quality
in
there
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
but
again
overall
not
horrible
i
gave
it
a
4
on
drinkability
as
it
was
very
easy
drinking
although
it
may
seem
like
i
panned
this
brew
overall
it
was
not
bad
i
would
certainly
take
it
over
any
macro
except
maybe
sam
adams
and
it
certainly
is
on
par
with
beers
like
bass
ale
a
good
session
brew
at
a
price
you
cant
beat
certainly
in
the
upper
quality
echelon
of
domestic
macros
this
beer
offers
a
good
taste
nothing
super
but
nice
the
aroma
is
lacking
not
very
hoppy
very
drinkable
imo
and
cheap
too
only
910
bucks
a
twelve
pack
depending
on
where
you
live
rich
amber
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
nice
grainy
lager
smell
not
skunky
at
all
the
taste
is
grainy
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
to
round
things
out
close
to
medium
mouthfeel
no
complaints
i
think
this
is
an
a
for
its
american
lager
style
i
can
safely
say
i
havent
had
better
as
far
as
thats
concerned
it
blows
bud
out
of
the
water
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
just
an
american
lager
pours
a
clear
amber
gold
with
a
five
second
head
that
leaves
a
slim
ring
of
light
lace
aroma
is
subdued
with
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
is
all
about
the
carbonation
light
to
medium
bodied
and
feels
like
an
american
mainsteam
lager
taste
is
somewhat
grainy
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
a
solid
american
lager
smooth
and
very
drinkable
im
impressed
that
this
does
not
taste
watered
down
at
all
excellent
alternative
to
anything
by
the
big
macros
lager
has
become
the
beer
most
found
in
the
local
pubs
around
philadelphia
except
of
course
for
the
bud
family
it
is
an
acceptable
beer
for
almost
everyone
a
very
safe
alternative
to
take
with
you
anywhere
it
pours
a
really
nice
amber
slightly
hazy
with
a
thin
head
and
a
little
lacing
the
flavor
is
straight
forward
malt
and
other
grains
with
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
present
it
is
nicely
carbonated
without
having
the
bubbles
of
a
soda
pop
i
like
the
simple
taste
of
a
lager
it
is
very
good
cold
okay
a
little
warmer
and
even
okay
ice
cold
the
taste
is
one
of
grain
hops
and
alcohol
with
a
good
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
it
is
really
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
the
alcohol
content
is
low
enough
to
not
penalize
knocking
back
more
than
a
couple
the
lager
poured
a
light
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
it
smelled
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
light
spicieness
this
beer
had
a
nice
bright
taste
with
plenty
of
hops
and
traces
of
spice
it
felt
light
and
somewhat
dry
in
the
mouth
as
american
mass
produced
beers
go
yuengling
is
one
of
the
best
this
is
a
beer
that
im
glad
to
see
available
in
bars
so
that
im
not
forced
into
drinking
some
of
the
more
popular
yet
lest
palatable
brews
the
beer
pours
out
a
light
coppery
color
with
decent
head
the
smell
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
if
you
are
in
most
local
bars
this
is
the
beer
to
get
i
drink
this
beer
just
about
every
week
when
i
go
to
the
bar
around
my
house
its
a
lot
better
than
the
other
popular
macros
like
bud
coors
or
miller
this
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
and
is
a
great
beer
to
have
with
some
friends
while
watching
a
game
at
your
local
sports
bar
and
having
some
buffalo
wings
a
gourmet
beer
it
is
not
but
it
certainly
serves
its
purpose
being
a
good
drinkable
beer
when
you
go
out
with
some
friends
this
one
is
my
current
standby
for
dirt
cheap
easily
available
american
beer
quite
drinkable
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
spotty
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
is
full
of
pale
lager
and
light
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
is
a
malty
lager
with
a
dry
finish
it
has
a
simple
goodness
to
it
yuengling
likes
to
keep
it
basic
but
it
seems
to
work
for
them
their
whole
line
of
beers
are
good
but
most
are
very
simple
recipes
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
very
well
a
fine
lager
from
americas
oldest
brewery
pours
a
very
pretty
dark
gold
moderate
carbonation
and
head
smell
is
actually
somewhat
funky
to
me
almost
like
stale
beer
but
also
hoppy
a
sweet
beer
this
brew
is
all
right
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
respectable
lager
but
by
no
means
an
outstanding
one
i
will
drink
this
if
given
to
me
but
i
wont
buy
it
this
beer
is
revered
here
in
pa
and
i
guess
its
because
it
is
a
local
and
distinguishes
itself
from
a
sea
of
macro
clones
for
what
its
worth
it
is
a
a
notch
above
the
national
swill
but
not
much
more
ill
only
drink
it
if
there
are
absolutely
no
other
choices
cabbadgy
nose
light
amber
in
color
minimal
malt
minimal
hops
watery
prickly
on
the
tongue
in
the
finish
not
much
to
offer
here
id
put
this
a
notch
above
the
macros
but
not
up
to
the
level
of
the
comparable
brew
in
the
saranac
line
overall
not
a
bad
cheapo
beer
probably
your
best
amongst
the
miller
bud
coors
catagory
this
was
easily
the
beer
i
drank
the
most
in
college
at
psu
and
with
4
pitchers
of
a
beer
which
tastes
millions
of
times
better
than
any
macro
its
easy
to
see
why
it
pours
a
good
copper
color
with
a
head
that
doesnt
linger
too
long
at
all
there
isnt
much
hop
nose
at
all
however
there
is
a
slight
maltcorn
aroma
the
taste
is
fairly
light
do
to
the
addition
of
the
corn
into
the
mashwhich
also
makes
this
beer
easy
to
drink
overall
its
a
decent
beer
and
is
my
traditional
backup
beer
if
the
rest
of
the
stuff
they
have
on
tap
ends
in
light
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
good
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
grassy
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
malty
at
first
a
little
bready
in
the
middle
has
a
good
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
a
very
well
balanced
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
light
but
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
a
good
wellrounded
lager
green
long
neck
twist
off
bottle
i
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
and
finally
decided
to
try
it
at
a
local
pub
light
yellow
in
color
not
much
of
a
head
i
was
disappointed
with
the
taste
very
little
hops
not
very
complex
seemed
bland
to
me
the
flavor
was
simply
weak
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
considering
all
the
hype
i
had
hear
about
this
beer
very
drinkable
though
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
lot
better
consumed
with
food
char
but
its
still
a
lawnmowercamden
yardsonly
beer
an
appealing
dark
amber
color
does
not
disappoint
on
taste
presents
as
caramel
more
so
than
butterscotch
meduim
carbonation
lends
itself
to
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
lager
sets
itself
apart
from
many
other
massproduced
offerings
body
is
medium
and
the
hops
are
present
but
not
overstated
it
offers
a
satisfying
flavor
that
lasts
all
night
long
the
taste
is
fairly
well
balanced
with
no
clear
winner
i
get
hints
of
caramel
then
citrus
with
limited
linger
yes
the
big
strength
is
drinkability
its
light
enough
for
several
should
you
be
so
inclined
and
has
enough
flavor
to
let
you
know
its
a
conscientious
beer
brewed
to
go
down
smooth
and
well
not
the
finest
of
course
but
a
yearround
staple
and
safe
for
almost
all
palates
its
more
enjoyable
than
any
single
quality
on
its
own
might
suggest
its
a
handy
green
bottle
to
have
on
hand
drink
it
cold
drink
it
proud
discovered
this
beer
while
on
vacation
last
summer
on
the
nc
coast
great
german
name
and
a
cool
label
excellent
appearance
with
a
thin
head
and
maltly
aroma
outstanding
beer
at
a
price
which
is
on
par
with
the
macobrew
swill
that
everyone
else
drinks
look
forward
to
distribution
in
my
area
soon
bottom
line
when
you
reach
for
the
cheap
sixerreach
for
this
drinkability
quite
drinkable
but
not
all
that
exciting
enjoyable
but
no
need
for
me
to
seek
this
one
out
this
beer
is
just
a
lighweight
no
nonsense
lager
that
is
consistently
clean
and
clear
i
tend
to
find
a
lot
of
girls
like
this
beer
and
thats
why
i
keep
it
stocked
in
my
fridge
my
mother
often
has
yuengling
in
bottles
and
i
can
remember
trying
it
and
not
liking
it
tasted
too
bready
for
me
from
what
i
can
recall
however
recently
i
was
out
at
someones
house
who
had
a
keg
of
lager
and
unfortunately
it
was
either
that
milwaukees
best
or
seagrams
7
so
i
chose
the
yuengling
it
wasnt
bready
this
time
to
me
but
it
tasted
like
it
was
artificially
sweetened
i
know
its
a
popular
beer
in
this
area
but
i
dont
drink
it
so
i
dont
know
if
this
is
what
its
supposed
to
taste
like
or
if
its
more
like
the
bready
taste
out
of
the
bottle
that
i
remember
anyway
it
seemed
a
little
flat
and
almost
too
thick
for
the
flavor
if
that
makes
sense
i
can
see
how
its
popular
though
given
the
alternatives
of
bud
and
the
likes
because
it
does
have
flavor
its
just
not
my
favorite
flavor
yuengling
now
has
tv
commercials
complete
with
girls
in
bikinis
at
least
in
the
philadelphia
area
which
doesnt
seem
quite
necessary
a
trip
to
the
brewery
is
pottsville
is
definitely
worth
the
trip
although
theyre
a
little
bit
chinsy
on
the
free
samples
id
say
experience
must
count
for
something
because
americas
oldest
brewery
could
definitely
teach
the
big
three
a
few
things
about
making
a
quality
lager
its
darker
than
most
almost
an
amber
its
richer
and
fuller
as
well
definitely
a
lager
but
i
dont
think
its
as
crisp
as
some
its
just
really
smooth
ive
had
it
each
of
the
past
four
weeks
for
tailgating
great
session
brew
backdated
tasting
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
on
10sep03
this
post
is
based
on
notes
from
that
review
the
nose
is
light
and
quite
lagerlike
with
a
nice
malt
sense
being
present
the
flavor
is
full
and
quite
enjoyable
a
very
session
brew
a
nice
crisp
finish
yuengling
traditional
lager
tastes
absolutely
great
i
had
tasted
black
and
tan
before
but
never
the
traditional
lager
i
must
say
it
tastes
great
there
isnt
a
strong
aftertaste
and
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
it
also
has
a
great
mouthfeel
i
recommend
yuengling
traditional
lager
to
anybody
overall
impression
not
bad
wouldnt
drive
the
2000
miles
to
go
get
some
but
would
buy
some
if
it
was
local
just
to
keep
a
part
of
our
beer
history
alive
this
lager
was
light
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
aroma
was
present
as
some
slight
sweetness
was
barely
noticeable
the
flavor
leans
towards
the
malts
as
the
hop
level
is
on
the
lighter
side
the
sweetness
rides
the
tongue
but
then
does
develop
into
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
very
drinkable
as
it
is
relatively
light
bodied
and
flavors
are
not
overpowering
best
of
luck
against
the
bigger
macros
this
is
a
beer
i
forgot
to
try
while
in
virginia
but
a
coworker
brought
back
his
last
visit
to
his
hometown
area
near
the
pennnsylvania
border
it
poured
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
and
formed
a
foamy
white
head
that
disappeared
fairly
quickly
and
left
some
trace
circular
lace
a
very
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
hops
and
some
malt
with
a
very
mild
hint
of
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
caramel
and
the
body
was
fairly
thin
with
a
slight
bittness
and
astrigency
in
the
finish
as
far
as
lager
goes
for
its
price
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
americas
oldest
brewery
suprisingly
has
resisted
the
urge
to
lighten
up
their
flagship
so
it
looks
and
taste
more
like
megabrewed
crap
color
is
certainly
amber
kicks
up
a
frothy
head
sweet
malty
taste
almost
roasty
caramel
and
trace
of
flavoring
hops
surprising
yeast
taste
may
turn
off
some
people
could
the
big
bottle
have
been
old
still
an
interesting
catch
had
the
whole
quart
and
3
lord
chesterfields
and
didnt
feel
a
thing
a
not
greatnot
terrible
beer
sam
adams
likes
to
say
their
boston
lager
returned
america
to
flavorful
beer
but
these
guys
have
been
doing
it
for
way
longer
being
from
maryland
i
have
always
been
around
yuengling
and
i
hope
i
always
will
be
in
the
future
talk
about
a
session
beer
not
only
is
this
stuff
cheap
by
comparison
even
to
macroswill
it
is
actually
good
pours
a
nice
amber
definite
maplesugarsyrup
flavor
to
the
beer
but
its
only
a
hint
not
a
defining
characteristic
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
very
good
mouthfeel
for
a
lager
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
full
of
beer
not
water
i
know
people
who
say
this
is
their
favorite
beer
its
not
that
good
but
i
cant
afford
to
keep
the
fridge
stocked
with
rochefort
6
and
st
bernardus
and
this
beer
is
an
incredible
bang
for
the
buck
i
frequently
find
it
for
13
99
a
case
bottles
in
my
area
and
ive
heard
its
cheaper
in
pa
i
popped
the
cap
and
was
hit
with
a
sweet
aroma
nicely
carbonated
i
poured
this
darkish
lager
and
watched
the
strong
head
form
as
ive
done
before
medium
body
not
to
dark
not
to
heavy
a
nice
looking
lager
the
finish
was
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
butt
the
aftertaste
was
the
slightest
bit
bitter
nice
finish
kind
of
balance
the
whole
thing
out
one
of
the
best
american
lagers
this
is
no
longer
the
beer
that
i
remember
not
that
is
was
ever
anythign
extravegant
yuengling
seemingly
used
to
be
a
fuller
more
flavourful
beer
now
its
really
just
a
step
above
the
buds
and
coors
of
the
world
though
i
must
add
that
yuenglings
drinkability
is
tenfold
better
than
any
of
those
brews
it
pours
a
slightly
watery
looking
light
amber
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
lager
taste
as
i
said
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
remember
mostly
standard
malt
and
hop
flavours
here
nothing
daring
theres
a
bit
of
earthiness
as
well
it
can
usually
be
found
rather
cheaply
on
tap
and
in
stores
so
if
the
moneys
tight
its
not
a
horrible
choice
but
for
maybe
a
buck
more
for
a
6
pack
there
are
tons
of
better
brews
to
choose
from
the
beer
is
a
little
thin
but
has
an
obvious
malt
sweetness
and
an
unexpected
hop
presence
although
this
is
far
from
a
hoppy
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
nothing
special
here
however
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
can
see
having
a
few
yuenglings
in
one
sitting
but
i
wouldnt
think
it
would
be
good
with
food
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
a
beer
for
drankin
not
savoring
nice
clear
amber
in
color
decent
foamy
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
before
retreating
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
malty
aroma
with
a
good
hop
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
with
this
one
and
the
flavors
are
all
a
bit
subdued
theres
a
slight
sweet
malt
taste
that
is
fairly
well
balanced
with
restrained
hop
bitterness
the
sweetness
comes
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
theres
a
slight
bitter
finish
carbonation
is
moderate
this
one
is
definitely
crisp
clean
and
uncomplicated
as
a
side
note
ive
never
enjoyed
this
ontap
too
little
head
retention
mouthfeel
suffers
and
the
carbonation
goes
out
the
window
ends
up
looking
like
cider
could
just
be
personal
preference
its
not
a
classic
but
much
better
with
say
pizza
than
the
insipid
american
pale
lagers
of
the
mass
producers
this
is
a
bitter
sour
horribly
sharp
thin
skunky
beer
it
makes
my
tongue
want
to
hide
also
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
check
out
the
brewer
up
on
rte
61
it
is
not
to
be
missed
it
is
definately
the
oldest
brewery
in
america
john
a
heavyhanded
lager
with
macro
leanings
a
bit
grassy
and
husky
with
some
tannins
evident
somewhat
sweet
which
took
the
edge
of
what
would
otherwise
have
been
a
harsh
malt
profile
but
the
flavor
was
not
engaging
and
it
was
a
chore
to
work
through
the
glass
after
all
that
thid
is
just
a
basic
lager
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
it
did
finish
crisp
and
clean
certainly
worth
a
try
but
only
once
the
taste
is
watery
but
well
balanced
very
lean
texture
with
slatey
minerally
extracts
rising
through
the
illusion
of
rich
baked
goods
no
palate
presence
no
finish
not
unpleasant
well
crafted
i
aquired
a
single
bottle
of
this
fabled
beer
it
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
diappated
into
a
thin
lacy
white
color
the
taste
ah
the
taste
i
was
shocked
at
first
by
what
i
felt
was
a
sharp
acid
subtle
bitter
taste
but
after
a
few
more
sips
it
mellowed
into
a
dull
enjoyable
sensation
i
wish
i
had
more
than
the
one
but
alas
i
must
wait
until
opportunity
arises
again
as
anyone
from
pa
knows
yuengling
is
the
hometown
hero
it
can
be
found
in
evey
distributor
across
the
state
and
in
most
every
bar
known
as
simply
lager
its
not
going
to
change
either
so
quit
bitching
the
beer
has
a
huge
following
and
one
that
is
not
entirely
unfounded
i
realize
that
there
are
a
plethora
of
more
complex
more
refined
more
expressive
and
more
challenging
beers
out
there
of
course
but
taken
for
what
it
is
lager
is
hard
to
beat
on
tap
the
beer
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
very
thin
head
that
quickly
disappears
taste
is
balanced
well
with
a
foundation
of
malt
that
is
given
some
life
by
a
blend
of
hops
it
does
not
exude
any
particular
hopfeel
and
the
bitterness
is
very
refrained
it
exhibits
much
more
character
than
any
other
macro
lager
out
there
mediumdark
slightly
sweet
slightly
bitter
and
refreshing
ive
bought
more
cases
and
pitchers
of
this
than
any
other
beer
as
it
goes
down
easily
and
tastes
great
i
know
im
biased
i
know
theres
better
but
i
know
i
feel
bad
for
people
who
are
out
of
the
distribution
area
as
they
are
missing
out
on
americas
best
everyday
beer
a
fairly
deep
amber
colored
body
is
capped
by
a
loose
offwhite
head
that
drops
readily
to
a
thin
surface
covering
and
leaves
only
minor
transient
lace
about
the
glass
in
the
nose
a
sweetish
malt
dominates
with
a
light
hint
of
fruitiness
from
the
christian
schmidt
yeast
its
light
to
medium
bodied
and
gently
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
fine
carbonation
that
allows
it
to
become
slightly
creamy
as
it
warms
the
flavor
delivers
a
gently
sweet
malt
thats
wellinfused
with
a
mildly
floral
hop
flavor
and
lowlevel
bitterness
along
with
the
yuengling
houseflavor
it
finishes
quickly
but
leaves
a
mild
residue
of
sweet
malt
that
continues
to
build
on
the
palate
an
easy
drinking
beer
thats
balanced
towards
sweetness
but
still
remains
enjoyable
for
a
few
many
guys
on
here
grow
up
in
there
high
school
and
college
years
drinking
beers
like
budweiser
mgd
and
coors
but
around
here
in
northeast
pa
yuengling
is
king
at
first
pour
you
will
notice
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
chesnut
color
to
it
with
a
decent
head
which
does
provide
some
lacing
as
you
inhale
the
aroma
you
can
sense
a
sort
of
pungentness
found
in
many
euro
mass
brewed
lagers
like
becks
as
far
as
taste
goes
unlike
many
american
lagers
out
there
yuengling
actually
has
some
its
quite
nutty
with
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
flavor
towards
the
end
the
only
real
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
it
has
a
tendancy
to
go
flat
a
bit
quicker
than
others
if
you
were
looking
for
a
highly
drinkable
beer
for
a
bbq
or
camping
trip
yuengling
lager
would
absolutely
be
a
great
pickup
especially
at
16
dollars
a
case
one
other
note
another
local
brew
made
by
the
lion
brewery
is
called
pocono
lager
that
beer
and
yuengling
are
almost
carbon
copies
of
one
another
poured
an
amber
brown
unknown
head
behavior
as
i
got
this
on
draught
at
a
restaurant
and
it
was
gone
by
the
time
i
got
the
beer
minimal
lacing
aroma
was
slightly
nutty
good
malt
presence
mouthful
was
good
medium
to
high
carbonation
but
not
distracting
taste
was
malty
with
some
frutiness
and
a
good
hop
balance
not
entirely
pleasing
though
dry
bitter
finish
i
had
it
with
grilled
chicken
and
it
actually
tasted
worse
with
the
food
a
good
looking
brew
that
had
a
taste
closer
to
fizzy
yellow
stuff
this
brew
pours
an
amber
color
topped
off
with
a
fairly
decent
off
white
head
the
head
fades
at
a
good
rate
leaving
little
lace
the
aroma
is
mainly
malt
the
taste
is
also
malt
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
no
noticeable
hops
drinkability
is
a
hard
one
to
rate
im
sure
you
could
pound
a
few
of
these
but
with
not
much
flavor
why
bother
whats
up
with
the
green
bottles
though
this
was
incredibly
cheap
and
it
shows
it
was
a
so
so
beer
but
definitely
of
the
megamacro
variety
the
pour
was
nice
with
a
light
copper
color
and
there
was
a
small
white
head
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
there
was
no
lace
to
speak
of
just
some
film
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
pretty
swilly
with
a
lot
of
adjuncts
and
not
even
a
very
distinct
malt
characteristic
the
taste
reminded
me
of
an
overly
qualified
genesee
red
it
had
a
lot
of
corn
flavor
without
a
hint
of
any
hops
and
not
even
the
sweetness
i
was
expecting
i
can
imagine
that
the
entire
line
of
yeungling
was
something
much
better
preprohibition
but
i
had
to
give
a
nod
the
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
u
s
ok
that
was
silly
rating
a
yuengling
like
it
was
some
sort
of
grand
cru
its
just
a
good
bluecollar
everyday
beer
this
over
a
bud
anyday
f
i
really
dont
like
the
publics
perception
of
this
beer
around
here
all
you
have
to
say
is
you
want
a
lager
and
they
bring
you
a
yuengling
like
its
the
only
kind
in
existence
i
have
to
restrain
myself
from
telling
people
its
just
an
average
beer
made
using
corn
grits
as
an
ingredient
and
that
lager
does
not
mean
amber
colored
beer
thats
only
about
the
beers
image
though
the
beer
itself
is
quite
good
it
pours
with
that
famous
amber
color
with
a
head
that
diminishes
as
quickly
as
it
forms
the
taste
has
a
malty
sweetness
and
the
hops
lend
a
slight
citrusy
dryness
its
very
well
balanced
which
makes
this
way
better
than
any
other
macro
id
call
this
an
all
purpose
beer
this
beer
is
cheap
widely
available
and
it
can
be
paired
with
virtually
any
food
thats
what
makes
it
a
great
fallback
beer
its
the
kind
of
beer
thats
worth
keeping
a
case
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
even
though
you
usually
crave
something
better
a
seltzery
effervescence
and
head
fizz
away
in
a
hurry
zzzzz
there
is
absolutely
nothing
exciting
about
this
beer
at
all
its
a
plain
jane
lager
and
its
a
shitload
better
than
bud
miller
junk
etc
a
little
sweetness
comes
through
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
a
dry
finish
combines
with
no
aftertaste
and
there
you
have
it
a
perfect
alternative
to
macros
if
i
know
i
will
be
consuming
large
amounts
of
beer
for
certain
occasions
this
will
always
be
my
choice
if
it
is
available
where
i
am
never
dissappointing
never
exciting
always
pleasing
in
its
own
simple
way
maybe
im
biased
but
who
cares
i
love
this
stuff
and
so
does
my
nonaching
head
the
next
day
i
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
try
this
one
i
have
heard
so
many
good
things
from
so
many
people
about
the
quality
of
this
beer
unfortunately
i
was
far
from
impressed
i
was
hoping
for
a
great
flavorful
excursion
into
the
land
of
pilsners
but
was
greated
by
a
slighlty
darker
version
of
regular
old
bud
left
a
stale
taste
in
my
mouth
and
in
my
soul
the
taste
has
very
mellow
malts
some
hops
but
not
a
lot
i
seem
to
always
detect
a
slight
lemony
aftertaste
and
then
something
slightly
metallic
its
not
a
big
deal
though
i
would
drink
this
over
macroswill
any
day
this
beer
has
a
very
good
drinkability
in
all
seasons
and
with
all
kinds
of
different
beer
drinkers
a
decent
session
beer
and
a
good
everyday
choice
i
rate
it
next
to
pabst
blue
ribbon
if
youre
in
the
market
for
an
economy
lager
it
has
become
quite
popular
in
many
nj
dining
establishments
recently
making
it
a
good
alternative
to
budmillercoors
i
had
this
on
tap
and
i
was
quite
pleased
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
seemed
to
stay
throughout
the
drink
not
much
aroma
but
taste
was
crisp
and
well
balanced
with
a
little
bit
hop
assertivness
going
on
reminded
me
am
english
style
lager
sort
of
bready
but
in
nice
way
as
for
drinkability
this
beer
probably
goes
with
just
about
everything
i
hate
to
give
straight
threes
but
thats
how
this
beer
hits
me
when
up
against
bud
miller
and
pabst
it
is
clearly
superior
tasting
almost
like
halfway
to
a
sierra
nevada
some
hoppines
a
little
fruitiness
and
a
cleaner
quality
but
when
tried
against
the
sierra
its
significantly
inferior
with
that
american
lager
smell
and
taste
makes
the
sierra
taste
unbelievably
good
nice
amber
color
small
head
very
little
retention
clean
goes
down
real
easy
if
you
like
american
mainstream
lagers
definitely
seek
this
out
as
it
is
the
best
that
ive
tried
of
the
lot
but
in
comparison
to
any
of
the
great
beers
fuggedabouddit
this
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
woodsyamber
color
the
head
was
a
thin
white
color
and
consistency
and
no
lace
seemed
to
be
present
the
aroma
was
fairly
crisp
hints
of
malt
hops
and
some
flowers
seemed
to
be
present
the
taste
was
ok
subtypical
lager
nothing
to
write
home
about
tastes
of
some
sweet
malt
fruit
and
bitter
hops
were
present
decently
carbonated
to
me
this
beer
is
very
generic
for
this
style
i
have
drank
this
before
and
try
to
stay
away
from
it
dt
it
makes
me
feel
nauseous
the
next
morning
i
like
lagers
but
for
some
reason
this
beer
does
not
impress
me
i
will
have
1
when
there
is
no
other
choice
or
just
drink
ice
tea
they
must
know
something
since
they
have
been
brewing
for
such
along
time
just
not
my
mug
of
beer
the
oldest
american
continously
running
brewery
just
that
alone
i
think
i
have
to
pay
my
respects
this
was
the
beer
that
in
the
northern
panhandle
of
wv
still
in
high
school
we
would
cross
the
border
into
pa
to
get
our
hands
on
the
good
stuff
yuengling
traditional
amber
lager
was
a
beer
we
all
yearned
for
considering
most
days
we
drank
mostly
coors
light
and
busch
she
pours
with
an
amber
brown
hue
with
heavily
carbonated
white
colored
head
the
aroma
consists
pimarily
of
sweet
malt
possibly
caramel
and
there
is
a
weak
but
present
hop
like
aroma
i
would
like
to
the
thank
the
yuengling
family
for
keeping
up
a
better
product
than
the
macros
out
there
and
keeping
their
beers
moderately
priced
the
lighter
bodied
beer
has
a
rather
thin
texture
and
it
does
annoy
me
that
most
of
the
time
this
beer
gets
way
to
much
credit
as
being
the
good
stuff
when
in
reality
it
is
a
mediocre
beer
that
is
great
for
getting
people
away
from
the
fizzy
yelllow
brews
this
country
mainly
has
to
offer
a
relatively
sweet
but
mostly
bitter
crisp
finish
forms
a
classic
taste
that
i
cherish
yes
i
cannot
lie
i
can
drink
my
fair
share
of
it
but
it
really
isnt
a
beer
that
i
should
spend
much
time
on
i
love
the
price
for
a
sixpack
of
this
4
99
a
six
packyour
drinking
a
wellmade
beer
and
it
is
cheaper
then
ab
productsvery
good
on
tap
is
a
staple
of
mine
when
i
go
out
and
dont
have
alot
of
money
good
to
see
the
little
breweries
get
recognized
so
ab
and
the
rest
dont
have
control
over
everything
in
the
supermarkets
overall
i
think
of
this
beer
as
a
step
above
the
macros
but
certainly
aimed
at
the
massmarket
ive
had
it
on
tap
at
many
bars
in
pa
and
its
a
little
better
than
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
big
boys
in
american
brewerys
i
couldnt
get
it
down
in
sc
so
i
would
bring
cases
of
it
down
its
cheap
and
its
really
good
for
the
price
has
a
nice
light
but
not
too
light
taste
to
it
and
finishes
smoother
than
a
babies
a
go
get
some
for
a
bud
priced
beer
this
one
is
a
real
winner
definitely
not
swill
it
aint
hop
devil
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
its
nice
to
see
this
brewery
make
its
way
up
and
down
the
eastern
seaboard
go
yuengling
go
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
body
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
leaves
some
trails
of
lace
smell
is
a
bit
grainy
but
not
too
bad
taste
is
fairly
wellbalanced
with
some
metallic
elements
nice
overall
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkabilitywise
this
scores
highly
a
very
quaffable
clean
american
lager
that
makes
for
an
excellent
session
brew
growing
up
near
pottsville
pa
yuenglings
my
hometown
brewery
and
their
lager
is
the
first
beer
i
began
drinking
reguarly
while
i
am
admittedly
biased
increased
tasting
experience
has
led
me
to
recognize
it
as
a
good
overall
american
amber
im
not
sure
if
its
reputation
among
devotees
or
perhaps
less
serious
beer
drinkers
as
a
nectar
of
the
gods
is
completely
justified
however
nonetheless
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
greatly
for
this
review
the
bottle
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
and
very
little
lacing
only
a
few
carbonation
bubbles
rose
to
the
surface
giving
the
beer
a
slightly
flat
apperance
i
noted
some
traces
of
corn
in
the
aroma
with
a
slight
malt
smell
too
there
was
also
a
small
indecipherable
metallic
odor
but
nothing
overpowering
the
taste
had
a
good
hopmalt
balance
with
a
very
pleasing
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
there
was
also
a
slight
corn
taste
i
believe
its
used
as
an
adjunct
in
brewing
but
the
lager
gets
away
with
it
this
beer
felt
very
creamy
and
the
medium
body
had
a
smooth
mouthfeel
yuengling
traditional
lager
remains
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
and
will
always
be
a
welcome
fallback
brew
for
me
head
it
pours
is
light
fluffy
and
small
evaporates
quickly
leaves
no
noticeable
lace
typical
amber
brown
average
appearance
taste
is
mellow
with
no
noticeable
hopiness
and
primarily
mellow
malts
strong
element
of
sweetness
and
some
alchohol
taste
to
it
as
well
carbonation
is
also
very
light
but
body
of
beer
does
have
a
substance
to
it
an
average
beer
with
a
slightly
above
average
taste
and
drinkability
its
a
local
fave
so
my
opinion
is
obviously
tainted
this
is
the
beer
i
fall
back
on
if
nothing
else
is
available
nice
copper
color
is
pleasing
to
the
eye

down

this
is
the
beer
i
give
to
my

friends
when
they
come
over
because
everyhting
else
is
too
bitter
or
too
heavy
it
cant
be
all
that
much
its
probably
better
than
90
of
the
beers
in
its
price
range

but
it
is
better
than
a
heine
it
tastes
very
similar
to
me
slightly
off

aftertaste
local
supermarkets
are
now
carring
this
one
in
florida
and
at
a
great
price
this
to
me
is
a
simple
and
going
to
some
of
the

i

several
of

of
what
a
good

should
be

this

my

returned
to
the

with
this
one
from

it
was
a

surprise
and
didnt
seem

expensive
compared
to
the
domestics
id
buy
it
again
the
next

i
enjoyed
this
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
a
amber
lager
it
had
pretty
much
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
still
but
i
still
wish
it
had
just
a
little
bit
of
hops
to
provide
some
balance
to
this
beer
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
fairly
crisp
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
i
would
start
to
get
bored
with
it
after
a
couple
but
if
i
wasnt
concerned
with
taste
im
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
them
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
and
the
mouthfeel
to
me
those
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
there
wasnt
any
hop
flavors
and
aromas
i
think
a
little
hops
would
help
this
beer
out
a
little
and
provide
a
little
bit
of
balance
to
it
i
might
by
this
beer
when
looking
for
a
nice
amber
lager
but
it
isnt
something
i
just
have
to
keep
stocked
in
my
fridge
but
i
do
recommend
it
if
you
enjoy
the
style
all
in
all
i
thought
this
beer
was
nice
but
theres
a
little
room
for
improvement
and
i
think
with
just
a
little
work
this
could
be
a
pretty
tasty
and
memorable
amber
lager
this
made
for
a
decent
first
impression
for
hop
city
and
im
interested
in
trying
more
of
their
beers
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
amber
lagers
ive
had
nice
job
guys
keep
up
the
solid
work
overall
this
is
a
malt
bomb
with
a
slight
hint
of
diacetyl
bland
subpar
mouthfeel
very
unimpressed
not
bad
but
a
little
disappointing
the
can
promises
subtle
hop
aroma
and
flavour
perfectly
balanced
by
roasty
toasty
caramel
malts
but
the
impression
is
more
of
a
dry
pilsnerlike
lager
with
very
subtle
nuttyroasted
notes
comparable
in
style
and
overall
balance
to
creemore
lager
but
not
as
good
to
my
tastes
worth
trying
if
youre
fan
of
noblehoppy
lagers
but
nothing
special
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
dominant
flavors
it
would
pair
well
with
food
o
good
nice
dunno
what
els
to

9
out
of
10
would
go
well
with
all
youd
have
a

with
but
its

some
darker

qualities
that
could
stand
up

some

very
enjoyable

poured
a
deep

colour
with
about
1

of
pale

coloured
head
an
attractive
looking
beer
the
head
dissipated
within
a
few
minutes
resolving
itself
into
a
collar
and
thin
film
that
left
some
modest
spotting
and
lacing
down
the
glass
some
small
slow
rising
bubbles
were
visible
in
the
beer
its
aroma
was
fairly
straightforward
hops
and
caramel
malts
given
the
brewers
name
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
hop
heavy
taste
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
balance
between
the
hop
flavour
and
sweet
caramel
malts
a
faint
lemon
taste
was
also
detectable
bsl
had
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingered
for
a
few
seconds
after
each
mouthful
but
nothing
overpowering
nor
too
long
lasting
the
carbonation
was
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
conservative
side
contributing
to
a
smooth
mouth
feel
and
i
would
describe
bsl
as
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
a
solid
straightforward
brew
that
is
good
enough
that
id
like
to
sample

bsl
represents
decent
value
for
money
solid
as

considering
that
it
is
an
import
i
was
surprised
the
pint
was
just

nice
looking
reddish
amber
body
but
no

not
sure
if
thats
due
to
the
pour
or
the
beer
itself
caramel
sweetness
mixed
with
a
strong
malty
nuttiness
flavor
isnt
actually
bad
and
a
decent
choice
among
bmc
lagers
not
a
bad
beer
worth
a
try
overall
not
bad
but
not
exciting
i
dont
feel
it
lives
up
to
the
hop
city
name
of
the
brewery
that
kind
of
makes
you
expect
a
little
bit
more
hop
character
than
this
has
otherwise
it
is
a
good
but
unexciting
amber
lager
paired
well
with

not

its
nice
to
see
more
attempts
at
quality
lagers
striving
for
some
differentiation
in
an
alecrowded
market
i
kinda
sorta
call
bs
on
the
hops
its
pretty
smooth
and
tasty
with
a
fair
amount
of
the
crystal
malts
and
a
slight
bite
of
hops
balancing
it
all
out
pretty
drinkable
not
bad
and
its
not
what
i
usually
expect
out
of
a
lager
id
probably
drink
it
again
overall
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
would
repeat
purchasing
with
some
unique
characteristics
especially
in
flavor
observed
in
very
few
other
beers
o
decent
lager
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
little
sweet
for
a
lager
but
ok
barking
squirrel
is
a
tasty
lager
that
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
slightly
hopped
up
vienna
style
it
tastes
good
and
is
very
drinkable
not
the
best
thing
on
the
planet
by
a
long
shot
but
tasty
enough
when
the
urge
for
a
more
maltforward
lager
strikes
malty
sweet
nose
some
caramel
same
to
taste
balanced
off
by
a
nice

bitterness
simple
across
the
board
easy
to

nothing
remarkable
or
untoward
possibly
just
a
tad
too
sweet
to
drink
a
ton
of
aroma
of
lager
yeast
clean
malt
and
hops
in
the
taste
light

bready
with

a
bit
more
beef
than
a
macro
lager
has
some
light

bitterness
and
flavor
just
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
a
decent
light
beer
option
without
being
too
light
bland
or
boring
o
overall
fairly
toasty

but
lacking
in
the
hops
so
prominently
displayed
on
the
label
o
really
not
bad
at
all
a
drinkable
lager
pretty
balanced
with
the
hops
taking
the
stage
however
this
is
not
a
very
hoppy
beer
with
24
ibus
this
is
a
lager
with
pleasant
malt
flavors
right
off
and
nice
blend
of
nuttiness
with
a
toasted
grain
taste
from
the
munich
malt
as
described
on
the
label
the
malt
tastes
fresh
yet
not
overly
sweet
which
is
a
good
foundation
for
the
subtle
hop
flavor
which
add
to
the
mild
yeast
taste
the
maltiness
goes
well
with
the
hops
which
have
a
hint
of
herbal
profile
as
the
lager
finishes
semidry
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
very
good
lager
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavor
which
makes
it
more
drinkable
thany
many
of
this
style
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
this
again
even
though
i
was
on
the
fence
about
the
first
purchase
its
not
very
complex
but
its
stupid
easy
drinking
in
fact
very
easy
drinking
quite
enjoyable
a
good
amber
lager
worth
exploring
again
o
bleh
with
a
name
like
hop
city
youd
think
theyd
try
to
incorporate
more
hops
into
their
beers
but
thats
quite
the
opposite
theres
no
real
hop
bite
or
flavors
in
here
tastes
like
minutely
watered
down
yuengling
with
less
flavor
no
thanks
overall
a
great
beer
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
hops
as
not
to
be
over
the
top
something
odd
i
always
pour
out
beer
into
a
glass
but
i
drank
a
few
of
these
from
the
bottle
out
ice
fishing
seems
to
taste
better
direct
from
bottle
maybe
it
was
just
the
environment
tho
overall
an
okay
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
again
nice
lager
i
am
very
into
ipas
so
this
has
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
end
after
a
malty
beginning
which
i
kind
of
enjoy
not
a
bad
after
taste
overall
a
decent
beer
i
might
buy
it
again
at
this
point
i
am
kind
of
on
the
fence
with
this
brew
a
case
would
probably
not
make
it
into
my
house
a
solid
and
pretty
tasty
drinkable
lager
easy
to
drink
good
thirst
quencher
would
have
it
again
overall
it
is
an
ok
brew
but
this
is
one
i
wouldnt
likely
go
to
again
as
there
are
much
better
andor
cheaper
out
there
ill
be
ordering
more
of
these
at
the
local
dive
im
a
fan
what
can
i
say
average
lager
with
just
enough
hops
and
malts
to
keep
it
out
of
a
very
bad
category
of
beers
overall
nothing
really
jumps
out
with
this
lager
but
i
did
find
it
to
be
an
easy
drinking
potential
session
beer
this
is
probably
a
step
up
from
your
generic
lagers
with
that
said
i
dont
see
myself
running
out
to
grab
another
6pack
of
this
dollar
for
dollar
yuengling
lager
has
proven
to
be
the
staple
in
one
of
my
three
taps
at
the
basement
bar
overall
a
crisp
refreshing
amberred
lager
for
me
it
is
a
little
malt
heavy
and
id
like
to
see
the
hops
play
a
slightly
stronger
role
pretty
easydrinking
the
crack
glug
was
a
pleasure
resulting
in
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
foamy
tawny
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
neplus
quality
clarity
enabling
me
to
see
through
walls
and
into
the
neighbors
kitchen
where
the
cat
was
asleep
on
the
counter
nose
was
heavy
with
a
biscuit
malt
scent
mouthfeel
was
full
especially
for
a
lager
and
the
biscuit
taste
continued
on
the
tongue
finish
was
semidry
with
a
lingering
taste
of
bread
or
biscuit
well
after
the
swallow
more
lagers
like
this
are
needed
pleasant
and
rich
pours
deep
and
amber
with
plenty
of
carbonation
subtle
unexceptional
lager
nose
balanced
body
defined
by
rich
malt
and
hints
of
sugar
with
traces
of
biting
hops
that
combine
to
leave
a
pleasant
aftertaste
big
challenging
taste
for
that
doesnt
overpower
more
ipa
than
lager
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
clear
amber
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
th
lacing
was
impressive
looking
as
well
as
the
thin
retention
it
had
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
grainy
and
sweet
smelling
with
a
bit
of
earth
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
with
some
musty
flavors
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
had
a
soft
carbonation
overall
its
a
pretty
good
brew
not
one
i
would
seek
out
often
but
still
a
sessionable
brew
that
could
be
enjoyed
frequently
o
not
bad
very
good
beer
for
the
money
cant
wait
to
see
what
hop
city
has
up
its
sleeve
next
my
second
review
and
as
with
my
first
bare
with
me
i
dont
reach
for
a
lager
when
i
want
a
good
brew
but
tonight
when
i
asked
the
bartender
for
something
different
he
handed
me
this
tall
16
ounce
can
i
poured
the
beer
into
my
glass
and
an
average
pour
produced
about
two
inches
of
thick
white
head
the
color
was
a
bit
darker
than
an
average
lager
and
allowed
less
light
through
the
beer
gives
off
a
typical
lager
aroma
a
metallic
hoppy
smell
the
taste
is
what
sets
this
drink
apart
for
a
lager
i
found
the
flavor
sweet
starting
with
a
toffee
taste
and
migrating
to
a
typical
lager
blend
of
malt
and
hops
that
initial
rush
of
sweet
toffee
really
drew
my
attention
however
the
body
was
also
nice
i
found
the
mouth
feel
to
be
a
bit
thicker
than
the
average
style
still
light
bit
teetering
on
medium
bodied
overall
if
i
ever
find
myself
with
a
hankering
for
a
lager
this
beer
would
absolutely
do
the
trick
it
doesnt
rewrite
the
style
rather
barking
squirrel
lager
serves
as
a
nice
edition
in
any
lager
lovers
library
looking
forward
to
seeing
other
brands
from
them
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
and
have
numerous
times
at
first
i
questioned
the
appearance
of
can
but
after
trying
barking
squirrel
i
enjoyed
it
as
it
was
a
beer
that
went
down
smooth
i
find
that
some
beers
drink
heavy
and
leave
you
feeling
bloated
with
barking
squiirel
i
did
not
experience
that
i
found
it
to
be
similar
to
creemore
another
beer
that
i
enjoy
d
i
wouldnt
hate
to
see
some
more
hops
here
hop
city
i
actually
wish
this
beer
wasnt
this
big
as
it
is
a
bit
hard
to
sip
boo
pass
i
tried
to
like
this
one
but
it
has
some
problems
for
me
appearance
is
pale
smell
is
sour
taste
starts
out
ok
tasting
like
a
typical
lager
but
the
more
one
drinks
the
more
it
has
this
inescapable
nasty
finish
that
builds
if
it
werent
for
the
finish
i
wouldnt
mind
the
beer
so
much
but
that
kills
it
for
me
overall
i
have
to
say
the
squirrels
bark
is
worse
then
its
bite
barking
squirrel
lager
looks
the
part
with
a
mild
shade
of
bronze
with
some
light
gold
balanced
within
the
hed
is
off
white
and
tight
looking
leaving
minor
cling
smell
is
a
typical
lager
the
malt
is
front
and
center
some
grassy
appeal
caramel
and
i
dont
get
any
hops
either
way
i
classify
this
more
as
a
lager
than
a
red
ale
24ibus
is
low
imo
so
dont
go
looking
for
a
hop
fix
although
the
can
may
fool
you
with
the
graphic
on
it
the
taste
is
pure
lager
with
grain
balancing
out
with
caramel
and
crystal
malt
i
guess
there
is
some
hops
used
but
they
aint
reaching
my
tounge
feel
is
in
between
light
and
medium
for
5
i
expected
a
lighter
body
not
bitter
at
all
while
the
carb
is
felt
this
will
be
in
the
runnings
if
i
need
a
quick
lager
fix
from
the
can
if
im
hiking
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
light
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
and
grains
taste
is
also
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
some
malts
lightly
hopped
easy
drinking
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
but
somewhat
bland
beer
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
with
so
much
hop
reference
it
wasnt
very
hoppy
and
the
flavor
wasnt
ground
breaking
not
bad
just
a
step
up
from
your
typical
american
amber
lager
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
more
than
i
actually
did
this
is
a
very
ordinary
lager
beer
it
has
your
typical
light
yellowish
hue
extra
carbonation
malty
feel
and
a
great
deal
of
foam
and
lace
this
beer
is
average
in
every
sense
of
the
word
buy
a
single
can
before
you
commit
to
a
4
pack
or
a
case
good
for
what
it
is
a
simple
easy
drinking
beer
i
would
prefer
boston
lager
being
at
the
same
price
point
i
see
this
comes
in
cans
as
well
why
did
they
send
us
bottles
then
seems
like
a
stupid
idea
as
a
middleatlantic
resident
when
i
ask
for
a
lager
i
get
a
yuengling
but
i
wish
i
got
a
hop
city
barking
squirrel
instead
this
is
close
to
a
sin
for
a
guy
who
lives
close
to
phl
love
the
dark
brown
color
and
pleasant
hint
of
caramel
oders
of
this
beer
a
definite
must
have
for
any
fan
of
lager
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
is
the
smooth
robust
finish
this
is
a
must
add
to
the
list
for
any
beer
drinker
ive
never
heard
of
hop
city
before
and
now
i
look
forward
to
the
next
beer
release
from
them
at
least
one
that
reaches
delaware
m
medium
bodied
lager
got
some
heft
to
it
highly
recommended
for
lagerheads
and
people
that
do
not
care
for
bitterlyhopped
beers
wow
this
is
a
delicious
pint
i
love
the
caramel
malts
in
this
and
the
european
hops
give
it
a
nice
blend
the
colour
is
rich
and
vibrant
for
an
amber
lager
it
is
very
appealing
to
the
eye
the
taste
gets
better
with
each
sip
and
the
aftertase
is
quite
nice
great
with
the
amzing
burgers
that
were
serveda
sessionable
craft
with
the
coolest
tap
marker
a
squirrel
holding
a
hop
cone
overall
a
very
good
amber
lager
that
i
would
buy
again
looking
forward
to
its
arrival
in
the
us
anxious
to
try
barking
squirrel
with
a
big
fat
tbone
steak
a
nicely
balanced
brew
it
served
as
a
great
companion
with
meals
comoposed
of
comfort
foods
e
g
roast
beef
barbeque
pork
etc
while
also
being
easy
to
quaff
on
its
own
id
be
curious
to
know
how
it
earned
its
name
since
ive
yet
to
try
it
with
any
squirrel
meat
great
malty
interpretation
of
a
amber
lager
really
great
beer
for
fall
competes
well
with
oktoberfest
craft
beers
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
great
amber
hue
sesionability
is
high
demands
more
than
one
beer
pair
with
roasted
chicken
and
spicy
stir
fry
when
this
beer
is
poured
you
notice
the
burnt
amber
color
right
away
the
head
on
the
beer
has
great
retention
that
remains
throughout
the
entire
drinking
time
the
smell
has
a
great
smell
of
malt
hops
and
a
hint
of
sweet
the
taste
is
a
little
hoppy
but
nothing
to
overpowering
the
malt
flavor
lets
a
fantastic
smoothness
to
the
beer
with
some
chocolate
hints
that
set
this
over
the
top
the
beer
finishes
very
clean
and
leaves
you
ready
for
another
taste
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
lager
i
had
this
beer
on
a
trip
to
toronto
and
am
very
excited
to
see
it
now
available
in
us
decent
stuff
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
im
guessing
this
is
their
flagship
brew
as
its
the
first
to
make
it
this
far
west
barking
squirrel
is
a
great
amber
lager
from
ontario
it
has
an
awesome
rich
burnt
orange
amber
color
with
an
incredible
head
the
two
row
malt
they
use
allows
the
beer
to
keep
its
perfect
head
throughout
the
entire
beer
which
i
can
very
much
appreciate
it
uses
three
of
the
four
noble
hops
so
i
can
appreciate
that
as
well
since
it
really
amps
up
the
flavor
of
the
amber
lager
it
sits
at
24
bus
so
it
has
a
nice
little
kick
but
goes
down
so
nicely
it
has
a
full
mouth
and
it
has
a
nice
roasted
aroma
the
mouth
has
a
nice
roasted
caramel
flavor
with
a
medium
body
and
a
bit
of
tartness
i
loved
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
amber
lager
it
was
full
and
robust
and
had
a
slight
hop
aftertaste
but
nothing
too
overwhelming
i
really
love
the
squirrel
character
and
have
seen
him
altered
to
meet
the
needs
of
several
establishments
thats
a
really
classy
niche
to
be
in
i
just
love
the
colour
the
aroma
and
the
unique
squirrel
icon
the
can
is
a
great
substitute
for
draught
sexy
dark
colour
neat
tight
frothy
foamy
head
nice
crisp
malty
lager
with
a
nice
subtle
hoppy
hint
in
the
finish
combination
leads
to
a
very
drinkable
lager
would
go
excellent
with
a
nice
peppercorncrusted
steak
wow
one
endearingly
tasty
amber
lager
big
toasty
malts
and
well
balanced
sassy
pilseneresque
hops
this
was
a
universal
hit
with
the
sherbrooke
staff
earlier
today
and
its
clear
why
this
is
a
heady
competitor
to
creemore
in
the
good
craft
lager
not
from
alberta
customer
sweepstakes
really
a
damned
fine
tipple
in
a
style
so
under
serviced
by
canadian
brewers
lo
these
many
years
clean
taste
mild
bittering
hops
and
a
distinctively
nuttybready
specialty
malt
in
there
somewhere
dry
and
crisp
feel
nice
light
bitterness
simple
yet
effective
pretty
much
a
flawless
lager
here
guess
haters
just
gonna
hate
the
hops
stay
in
the
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
more
complex
than
the
average
lager
but
lacking
some
hop
balance
and
as
a
result
gets
tired
t
light
fresh
with
light
malts
characters
well
done
but
with
the
mettalic
feel
on
the
finish
m
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
im
getting
a
bit
of
a
mixed
message
from
this
beer
something
about
the
brand
hop
city
would
make
me
think
more
hoppy
and
the
colour
make
me
want
to
think
its
an
ipa
or
apa
but
the
taste
which
is
a
pretty
good
grainheavey
lager
taste
with
a
little
extra
bitter
at
the
end
and
the
smell
which
somewhat
reminds
me
of
the
sour
smell
that
surrounds
big
breweries
that
6row
barley
smell
keep
throwing
me
off
that
being
said
its
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
which
sits
somewhere
between
an
amber
lager
and
a
pale
ale
compares
favourably
to
rickards
red
but
certainly
not
something
at
the
level
of
other
pseudomicro
brews
o
not
bad
amber
fairly
bland
but
nice
for
a
change
final
thoughts
its
alright
better
then
average
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
guess
if
you
were
looking
for
a
pale
lager
this
would
be
a
good
example
i
kinda
like
my
amber
lagers
to
be
a
bit
more
maltier
like
creemore
springs
d
pretty
drinkable
and
well
balanced
good
sessioning
brew
overall
ive
had
this
from
a
can
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
little
better
on
tap
perhaps
it
was
a
little
fresher
than
the
can
its
a
slightly
above
average
beer
that
is
a
decent
alternative
to
macros
it
also
might
work
well
as
a
gateway
to
get
other
into
craft
pours
a
copperamber
colour
with
a
huge
amount
of
foam
no
matter
how
delicately
i
poured
the
foam
kept
coming
dont
know
if
its
the
beer
itself
or
my
pouring
it
incorrectly
after
the
beer
settles
im
left
with
close
to
a
three
finger
foamy
head
that
refused
to
die
smell
is
well
ive
had
blander
toffee
caramel
bit
of
grass
and
citrus
some
roasted
breads
as
well
tastes
a
little
more
caramel
than
scent
toffee
is
light
some
citrus
tones
and
a
dry
taste
after
swallow
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
it
doesnt
feel
watered
down
but
weak
overall
id
say
it
makes
a
decent
session
beer
can
poured
a
clear
golden
lager
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
light
adjunct
notes
and
overly
sweet
malt
is
not
the
most
interesting
taste
is
also
more
adjunct
base
then
i
had
anticipated
with
not
much
other
characteristics
showing
off
and
not
much
hops
presence
definitely
not
one
i
will
drink
again
though
i
seems
to
be
off
compared
to
previous
ratings
overall
this
is
an
ok
amber
lager
a
bit
anemic
in
the
hop
department
and
theres
a
slight
off
flavor
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
finger
or
so
of
white
head
modest
density
to
it
light
lace
and
retention
aroma
of
grassy
hops
and
lightly
sweet
malts
some
bready
and
grainy
notes
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
follows
the
same
route
lightly
grassy
hops
initially
with
some
sweet
caramelly
and
toasty
breadiness
malts
are
the
main
feature
here
some
grainy
notes
maybe
a
bit
of
adjunct
flavour
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
which
isnt
entirely
pleasant
slightly
lighter
than
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
high
carbonation
a
moderate
amber
lager
and
nothing
too
impressive
could
pass
as
a
pizza
beer
but
ill
take
a
great
lakes
red
leaf
over
this
any
time
final
grade
3
79
a
b
overall
if
this
brew
was
not
a
faux
craft
i
think
it
would
receive
better
treatment
in
its
reviews
from
us
beer
snobs
interesting
take
on
the
style
that
has
the
nutty
and
fruity
elements
of
a
brown
ale
and
a
nice
bitterness
both
drinkable
and
very
satisfying
will
certainly
revisit
and
seek
out
other
beers
from
this
brewery
od
ive
had
this
a
few
times
before
and
i
remember
the
hop
profile
being
a
little
more
pronounced
good
for
a
faux
craft
beer
but
lacking
in
alot
of
areas
that
could
boost
it
to
a
very
solid
readily
available
beer
very
drinkable
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavours
and
aromas
overall
all
in
all
was
a
decent
lager
but
didnt
really
meet
my
expectations
especially
the
fact
that
they
call
themselves
hop
city
although
the
hops
are
there
its
just
not
as
strong
of
a
hop
presence
as
i
would
have
liked
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
barking
squirrel
or
really
any
lager
comparable
to
it
but
i
have
to
concede
that
if

or

bars
offered
this
ontap
id
likely
order
a
lot
more
beer
on
my
nights
out
and
i
also
bet
that
with
a
little
more
exposure
barking
squirrel
would
teach
and
persuade
mainstream
drinkers
to
also
be
a
little
more
discerning
with
their
beer
choices
i
could
certainly
have
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
although
there
wasnt
much
going
for
it
that
i
havent
seen
in
other
ontario
red
lagers
creemore
for
example
wasnt
bad
but
by
the
end
i
was
enviously
eyeing
my
brothers
hoegaarden
bucket
next
time
pours
a
nice
deep
gold
colour
with
a
little
white
head
that
lasted
through
the
whole
beer
the
smell
was
nothing
special
slight
hop
sent
with
some
malt
aroma
coming
through
quite
refreshing
and
creamy
though
not
great
thin
mouthfeel
is
very
light
but
better
than
most
mass
marketed
lagers
i
would
have
this
again
but
only
if
there
wasnt
anything
else
i
would
want
enjoyed

the
brewers
are
former
homebrewers
with
a
sugardaddy
grant
from
moosewood
who
will
of

help
to

them
the

good
drinkability
everything
else
is
where
it
fell
apart
the

was
a

with

of
floral
hops
taste
has
the
sweet
malt
without
too

going

just
not
anything

all
thats

to

is
what
is
this
if
it
is

lale
there
is
so
many
tastes
here
out
of
place
fruity
esters
in
lager
if
its
an
amber
lager
it
is
passable
but
uninspired
it
sure
is
not
a
bock
or
any
style
of
standard
lager
im
familiar
with
possibly
a
weak
steam
beer
or
weak
creemore
clone
needs
work
d
i
was
expecting
better
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
comes
off
as
a
macro
beer
focusing
on
drinkability
over
flavour
taps
a
reddish
amber

with
brown
hues

a

and
a

tiny

hops
are
probably
tettnang

saaz
or
both
more
bread

cereal
flavours
in
the
aftertaste
very
lagerlike
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
lightly
parched
finish
for
an
ambervienna
this
is
comparable
to
creemore
and
sam
adams
but
not
as
wellhopped
as
brooklyn
lager
while
barking
squirrel
isnt
ground
breaking
its
still
a
respectable
drinker
a
good
start
for
this
brewer
its
obvious
that
a
lot
of
marketing
money
has
been
thrown
at
this
brewery
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
aggressively
they
pursue
the
craft
market
it
will
also
be
interesting
to
see
how
our
local
microbreweries
will
respond
if
these
guys
start
to
eat
into
the
craft
lager
market
it
would
be
neat
to
see
some
of
them
branch
out
into
different
styles
and
try
to
differentiate
themselves
more
hop
city
is
quasiindependent
of
moosehead
just
as
creemore
are
of
molson
and
i
can
see
a
lot
of
parallels
between
the
flagship
brands
both
are
clean
easy
drinking
lagers
that
would
be
acceptable
to
craft
and
noncraft
drinkers
alike
does
this
mean
ill
start
drinking
barking
squirrel
all
the
time
no
ill
stick
with
the
fullerflavoured
offerings
i
prefer
but
this
will
be
an
excellent
choice
when
the
selection
is
sparse
as
it
gives
the
usual
macro
suspects
a
whuppin
being
an
affiliate
of
moosehead
brewery
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
this
beer
was
i
could
see
this
being
pretty
close
to
creemore
for
me
and
wouldnt
mind
switching
the
two
up
every
once
in
awhile
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
sure
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
pretty
decent
entry
into
the
craft
market
for
moosehead
could
be
more
craft
but
i
was
relatively
happy
with
the
quality
of
this
one
the
hops
shine
through
and
make
up
for
the
fruity
flavors
that
ale
yeast
would
usually
supply
with
fresher
flavors
maybe
it
was
from
the
alcohol
but
had
i
bought
another
bottle
it
would
have
been
easy
to
polish
that
off
in
a
sitting
while
not
a
session
beer
there
was
enough
to
like
here
without
this
feeling
weak
or
watereddown
and
this
was
about
as
balanced
a
beer
as
ive
had
for
this
style
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
would
have
made
this
stand
out
more
but
as
it
was
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
would
most
other
lagers
because
of
how
much
it
resembled
an
ale
worth
a
go
one
for
anyone
who
loves
balanced
beers
or
american
ambers
thanks
sparky
when
poured
it
has
a
dark
reddish
color
body
with
a
small
foamy
head
the
smell
has
a
grapefruit
fruity
hop
aroma
to
it
the
taste
has
a
citrus
hop
up
front
then
the
a
little
bitterness
comes
into
play
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
has
a
great
hop
flavor
enjoyable

overall
wellrounded
flavours
a
sweet

bitter

with
good

backing
add
a
reasonable
price
and
that
this
is
different
to
your
normal
grain
lager
definitely
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
have
had
to
date
rjt
ogreat
beer
has
a
great
hop
taste
and
a
malt
background
that
i
enjoyed
nice
brew
from
clown
shoes
not
sure
why
they
are
getting
a
bad
rap
out
here
in
colorado
all
of
their
stuff
has
been
solid
red
lager
hopped
aggressively
caramel
color
more
amber
than
red
with
over
an
inch
of
lacy
white
head
looks
great
the
nose
is
all
lemon
hops
citra
probably
and
maybe
something
for
bitterness
because
this
is
very
bitter
the
taste
is
malt
first
hops
second
with
a
distinct
lemon
character
all
the
way
through
one
of
the
first
reds
where
hop
bitterness
trumps
sweet
malt
and
i
really
like
it
soapy
sudsy
feel
really
big
for
a
lager
but
it
drinks
clean
in
the
finish
i
think
this
is
a
great
illustration
of
a
well
flavored
and
not
boring
lager
the
hopping
is
done
very
well
and
the
mouthfeel
is
big
for
the
style
these
guys
deserve
some
credit
for
making
some
really
neat
beer
o
ive
relearned
the
importance
of
looking
for
bottle
dates
very
carefully
before
purchasing
anything
hoppy
the
dryhopping
with
simcoe
and
citra
just
wasnt
there
for
me
ive
had
this
a
few
times
now
good
stuff
nice
hops
but
the
sweetness
of
it
detracts
a
little
pours
into
a
becker
a
clear
deep
bronze
with
a
large
blooming
head
that
leaces
two
full
rings
of
broken
lace
as
it
settles
oh
so
slowly
into
a
frothy
mass
the
simcoe
hops
stand
out
in
the
nose
along
with
caramel
malts
and
mild
toastlike
a
hopped
up
vienna
lager
to
me
dryer
on
the
palate
with
toasted
grainearthinessand
leafy
hop
goodnessa
little
more
oomph
from
the
leafy
hops
and
it
would
bump
up
my
score
a
damn
fine
amber
lagera
healthy
dose
of
hops
and
on
the
dryer
side
o
3
5
its
not
that
great
little
bit
of
a
dirtyearthy
taste
overall
a
quite
solid
beer
from
clown
shoes
that
i
would
drink
again
this
bottle
wasnt
extremely
fresh
so
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
something
fresher
overall
quite
a
good
deal
mixed
and
matched
for
2
50
and
i
found
it
quite
worth
it
a
great
tasting
hoppy
red
ale
despite
if
its
a
few
weeks
or
months
old
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
hoppy
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
o
this
would
make
a
great
everyday
drinker
great
beer
to
pair
with
any
meal
not
too
overwhelming
but
interesting
and
tasty
i
suspect
fresh
it
would
be
way
hoppier
ill
try
it
next
year
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
earthy
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
the
hop
profile
in
this
one
is
quite
earthy
overall
a
very
hoppy
citrusy
amber
ale
quite
tasty
and
worth
revisiting
could
use
more
carbonation
its
hard
enough
to
find
a
variety
of
red
lagers
and
even
harder
to
find
one
which
stands
out
clown
shoes
nailed
this
one
too
bad
its
brewed
as
a
summer
beer
because
honesty
i
could
see
this
working
during
the
winter
season
too
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
bright
amber
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
sparse
offwhite
surface
coat
of
head
aromas
of
tangy
sweet
caramel
resiny
and
piney
hops
grapefruit
and
mango
sweet
and
a
subtle
roasting
flavors
are
roast
and
rich
caramel
sweet
forward
with
a
very
quick
hops
bitterness
to
follow
tropical
fruit
notes
combine
with
the
piney
notes
to
balance
the
rich
sweet
backbone
light
effervesced
body
keeps
this
beer
very
drinkable
with
a
tangy
tropical
sweet
aftertaste
clean
effervescent
finish
with
a
subtle
drying
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
more
complex
than
expected
thankfully
the
hop
presence
is
stronger
and
more
interesting
than
the
aroma
hinted
toward
some
danksticky
bitterness
with
resinous
oils
pine
needle
and
grass
followed
by
a
subtle
summitonion
presence
before
the
malt
backbone
comes
in
sweet
caramel
flavor
along
with
toffee
hazelnut
some
dark
fruit
biscuit
and
graham
cracker
well
balanced
flavorful
and
decently
drinkable
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
her
but
its
a
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
didnt
really
like
this
one
it
seems
rushed
or
not
thought
out
good
name
and
pours
a
dirty
orange
amber
hue
with
a
two
finger
head
packed
full
of
little
bubbles
and
lacing
as
far
as
the
eye
can
seewoah
the
smell
is
defjbately
different
almost
smells
infected
like
a
weird
mix
of
blood
orangechicken
piecesstone
fruit
and
jelly
definitely
unique
and
obviously
thats
the
smell
as
on
taste
its
not
infected
it
starts
off
with
orange
marmaladeplum
jamsome
roasty
malts
that
give
a
nice
medium
body
and
finished
with
a
citrus
piney
smooth
bitterness
and
overall
yeah
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
to
make
me
come
back
cheers
good
but
not
quite
true
to
style
trying
this
one
fresh
results
in
a
much
brighter
and
citrus
prevalent
brew
swagger
is
a
solid
lager
with
some
earthy
depth
and
punchy
hops
to
go
with
the
balanced
malt
backbone
would
strut
with
this
one
again
o
loads
of
flavor
could
drink
the
whole
4pk
again
its
dank
and
full
bodied
but
also
creamy
delicious
pretty
good
citracentric
brew
nothing
short
of
a
hoppy
red
ale
superclean
and
delicious
this
is
a
downright
stellar
red
lager
this
deserves
to
be
at
the
top
of
its
class
thank
you
clown
shoes
the
session
police
say
that
6
abv
is
not
a
session
beer
but
a
few
pitchers
of
this
with
friends
would
be
very
welcome
a
good
everyday
beer
overall
pretty
nice
hoppy
red
ale
good
malts
and
nice
bitterness
balance
nice
hop
character
fairly
tasty
good
body
overall
pretty
nice
beer
i
was
worried
this
would
get
too
hoppy
too
bitter
or
too
much
sweet
candy
malt
character
since
its
clown
shoes
but
this
was
pretty
nice
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
foamy
head
and
some
persistent
lacing
wood
spice
and
buttery
goodness
roasted
malt
with
a
really
woody
tone
and
hints
of
spice
and
a
nice
does
of
grapefruit
earthy
and
hoppy
wellbalanced
combination
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
the
finish
is
bitter
and
gets
increasingly
sharp
and
drying
as
a
few
moments
go
by
after
swallowing
this
definitely
leads
me
to
crave
another
sip
right
away
as
usual
with
clown
shoes
beer
the
glass
is
almost
empty
by
the
time
my
review
is
coming
to
a
close
it
feels
rather
fullbodied
for
a
beer
only
6
abv
and
it
also
fully
coats
the
mouth
as
i
would
prefer
overall
an
american
amber
lager
is
is
a
vague
style
and
may
not
conjure
the
most
excitement
when
compared
to
others
thankfully
clown
shoes
took
a
little
bit
of
an
experimental
approach
that
yielded
a
very
flavorful
yet
easily
drinkable
beverage
if
youre
bored
of
the
average
lager
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
especially
if
youre
an
ipa
fan
as
it
bares
some
resemblance
to
east
coast
ipas
and
to
things
like
weyerbachers
double
simcoe
ipa
youve
gotta
love
that
name
too
this
is
a
very
quaffable
beer
its
not
going
to
blow
your
doors
off
but
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
an
easy
drinking
beer
nice
balance
of
flavors
good
for
any
occasion
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
from
clown
shoes
and
ill
gladly
drink
more
of
it
great
beer
very
traditional
for
an
english
style

ale

my
opinion
i
enjoy

since
this
one
was
free
o
solid
and
i
would
pick
it
up
again
but
nothing
to
blow
you
away
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
hop
presence
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
average
example
of
a
red
ale
there
was
pretty
much
no
complexity
too
this
beer
and
with
no
hops
showing
up
the
balance
wasnt
that
good
either
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
not
too
filling
but
the
flavors
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
so
one
pint
can
is
enough
for
me
i
have
no
urge
to
drink
another
one
after
this
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
nice
the
body
was
just
were
at
should
be
and
the
carbonation
was
good
too
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
bland
the
taste
was
all
i
could
pick
up
was
a
bland
and
generic
caramel
malt
flavors
with
nothing
else
really
shining
through
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
just
too
boring
of
a
beer
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
my
friends
it
had
nothing
that
sets
it
apart
for
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
let
down
with
this
beer
and
it
wasnt
memorable
i
like
that
rochester
mills
is
getting
their
beer
out
to
michigan
in
16oz
cans
but
i
have
yet
to
be
impressed
with
any
of
them
im
still
waiting
to
have
a
beer
that
i
like
from
them
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
was
one
forgettable
red
ale
man
disappointed
thats
all
i
can
say
about
this
beer
it
had
this
odd
smell
like
dusty
rocksmalts
it
was
unusual
and
not
in
a
good
way
the
taste
was
a
bit
better
it
had
a
very
deep
almost
stoutporter
flavor
with
a
kind
of
rusty
aftertaste
rochester
red
isnt
an
awful
beer
but
i
cant
say
its
something
id
have
again
just
not
made
with
the
highest
quality
of
malts
easy
drinking
brew
overall
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
its
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
just
a
bit
bland
i
wish
the
people
running
penguicon
picked
a
better
beer
to
serve
but
i
think
the
reason
it
was
chosen
was
because
it
wouldnt
be
that
offensive
of
a
beer
to
someone
who
is
used
to
mbc
beers
typical
red
ale
bland
taste
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
smelled
okay
nothing
to
write
home
about
notes
not
an
exceptional
beer
by
any
means
the
place
seems
to
be
almost
a
micromacro
brewery
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
better
suited
for
having
a
few
with
the
guys
than
when
you
really
want
to
appreciate
a
quality
brew
drank
on
draught
on
site
of
rochester
mills
beer
company
reddish
orange
in
appearance
served
with
one
finger
height
of
head
not
much
aroma
the
flavor
is
malty
with
some
caramel
not
much
else
going
on
in
the
flavor
a
rather
bland
style
the
freshness
of
the
beer
helps
some
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
beer
in
a
bottle
and
probably
wont
return
to
this
beer
again
good

solid

wouldnt
go
out

my

to
look

but
thats
just
me
i
know
my
gf
and
others
love
this
beer
a
bit
too
much
aftertaste
but
ok
overall
nice
amber
lager
simple
malts

this

has
a
long

with
a
blend
of
the
munich

base
and
the
hop
melange
not
wholly
harmonious
but
still
quite
enjoyable
too
hoppy
for
my
tongue
but
only
just
teeters
on
the
edge
of
being
enjoyable
before
eventually
falling
the
wrong
way
edit
after
drinking
an
entire
sixer
of
this
beer
over
a
week
im
less
impressed
something
seems
a
little
incongruous
about
the
flavors
definitely
an
original
brew
but
im
not
sure
the
disparate
elements
stylistically
hang
together
for
me
i
found
myself
liking
each
successive
bottle
less
than
the
last
m
lowmedium
carbonation
a
little
watery
in
the
middle
but
holds
up
to
my
expectations
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
tasty
hoppy
lager
overall
just
on
the
cusp
of
too
heavy
and
malty
it
turned
out
to
be
pretty
good
despite
not
being
what
i
expected
at
all
ps
can
still
taste
the
toffee
grapefruit
and
salt
halfhour
after
drinking
the
aftertaste
actually
becomes
more
pleasant
with
time
definitely
love
this
aspect
of
this
particular
beer
price
point
212
oz
single
as
the
amber
take
on
a
lager
for
what
it
is
this
is
nice
but
not
a
combo
that
appeals
to
me
i
am
blown
away
by
jacks
abby
and
the
variations
on
a
lager
theme
that
they
do
an
amber
just
doesnt
appeal
to
me
o
i
do
feel
as
though
some
jacks
abby
brews
are
too
similar
this
being
one
of
them
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
hoponius
union
although
not
as
good
with
that
being
said
its
a
very
solid
hoppy
amber
lager
which
to
my
knowledge
there
arent
many
of
great
hoppy
taste
and
drinkability
my
only
complain
is
a
weakish
malt
backbone
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
hoppy
beer
fanatic
especially
anyone
who
will
appreciate
the
smoothness
of
a
lager
with
the
hoppiness
of
a
pale
ale
a
delicious
hoppy
beer
with
great
balance
and
clean
flavors
pushes
towards
a
colder
season
lager
nice
and
malty
with
an
assertive
yet
not
aggressive
hop
character
solid
but
under
performs
against
the
rest
of
the
lineup
do
well
the
drinkability
is
there
but
given
its
high
abv
for
an
amber
lager
it
shouldnt
be
viewed
as
a
session
beer
thanks
for
this
oftoverlooked
style
mj0126
o
overall
a
solid
offering
from
jacks
abby
not
their
best
but
not
their
worst
either
overall
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
and
will
certainly
be
headed
back
for
more
ive
always
liked
malt
forward
yet
hoppy
beers
and
this
combines
those
with
a
lager
base
that
is
superb
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
interestingly
bitter
and
solvent
for
a
lager
but
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
thanks
again
heath
o
i
really
enjoy
this
for
the
late
fallwinter
months
warms
you
up
with
a
good
alcohol
content
cheers
o
a
very
nicely
done
brew
with
some
nice
minute
complexities
easy
to
drink
plus
it
now
comes
in
6packs
definitely
recommended
just
fabulous
hearty
rich
textured
and
full
of
flavor
the
stone
fruit
in
this
is
the
surprise
and
the
sensation
it
softens
the
hop
character
to
the
point
of
luxury
it
enhances
the
grain
sweetness
but
doesnt
overshadow
it
it
takes
to
the
bit
of
hop
spice
and
makes
this
beer
dapper
and
a
little
bit
sweet
overall

this
one
doesnt
bowl
you
over
in
any
one
regard
but
rather
it
shows
a
lot
of
subtlety
that
comes
out
here
and
there
when
you
probe
a
little
deeper
its
easy
to
drink
and
really
pleasing
if
youre
looking
to
just
kick
back
and
drink
something
immediately
tasty
and
not
too
crazy
but
its
also
great
if
youre
willing
to
sit
down
and
look
into
its
depth
and
complexity
this
is
really
damn
good
ive
always
expected
good
things
from
jacks
abby

this
is
very
pleasantly

overall
a
great

a
great
beer
would
have
no
idea
if
this
was
a
lager
if
it
didnt
tell
me
just
fantastic
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
but
i
almost
definitely
would
not
be
able
to
call
this
a
lager
in
a
blind
test
this
has
much
more
body
and
much
more
bitterness
than
i
was
expecting
very
ipalike
now
i
am
not
complaining
about
this
in
any
way
at
all
i
was
just
surprised
to
find
all
this
in
a
lager
jacks
abby
is
not
only
putting
out
great
lagers
theyre
putting
out
great
beers
o
other
then
the
aroma
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
its
not
my
style
and
i
still
quite
enjoyed
it
plus
the
fact
that
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
makes
it
totally
worth
a
try
i
would
recommend
it
especially
if
this
is
your
style
of
beer
overall
ok
but
not
great
the
malt
profile
is
nice
but
the
hops
dont
seem
to
do
as
well
as
i
expected
in
this
beer
theyre
nice
hops
but
bring
too
much
of
an
american
spicy
soapy
profile
to
mesh
well
with
the
lager
and
amber
malt
flavors
could
also
have
been
a
bit
more
crisp
also
the
booze
comes
through
a
bit
hot
and
would
be
very
nice
if
this
was
supposed
to
be
9
instead
of
7
2
i
do
like
that
perfumey
booze
on
a
doppelbock
but
this
is
a
regular
bock
that
being
said
its
still
a
nice
beer
with
great
malt
profile
tasty
and
drinkable
poured
from
half
liter
bottle
into
lager
glass
thick
foamy
white
head
over
golden
bronze
clear
liquid
head
persisted
for
a
while
then
dwindled
to
foamy
rafts
nice
lacing
aroma
was
slightly
hoppy
trace
citrus
swee
malt
underneath
the
flavor
is
clean
a
little
piney
a
little
floral
nice
grapefruit
bitterness
sweet
malty
flavors
underneath
pretty
well
balanced
went
nicely
with
spicy
chicken
and
salsa
i
was
eating
nice
brew
it
is
refreshing
and
a
great
change
from
the
heavy
winter
fare
would
be
good
for
friends
and
food
not
too
extreme
yet
flavorful
and
would
hold
its
own
with
hearty
grub
odbalanced
and
pretty
fun
not
my
favorite
jacks
offering
two
of
their
beers
are
probably
somewhere
in
my
top
1015
alltime
beers
this
one
is
not
in
the
same
stratosphere
but
it
is
well
worth
the
2
75
half
liter
price
i
will
always
give
their
beers
a
shot
probably
wont
go
back
to
this
one
but
it
is
still
better
than
5060
of
the
beers
i
will
try
this
month
o
im
not
quite
sure
where
they
were
trying
to
go
with
this
one
the
name
would
suggest
a
bock
kicked
up
a
notch
with
american
hops
not
a
bad
attempt
by
any
means
but
i
still
find
it
a
bit
confusing
on
the
palate
it
dries
out
a
bit
too
much
toward
the
finish
presumably
to
showcase
the
hops
more
but
that
kind
of
curtails
the
bock
aspect
of
it
unless
my
palate
deceives
me
it
seems
like
theres
some
specialty
malts
at
play
here
too
the
malt
base
just
doesnt
taste
as
complex
as
a
bocks
should
and
it
makes
for
some
odd
flavors
maybe
that
bubblegum
having
said
all
that
this
is
still
a
worthy
beer
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
beer
is
excellent
this
is
the
second
or
third
beer
ive
had
from
jacks
abby
that
seems
tough
to
categorize
stylewise
they
seem
to
bring
something
unique
to
the
table
with
their
take
on
each
style
the
take
a
stab
at
this
is
no
exception
the
ability
to
bring
a
great
hop
character
and
balance
it
this
well
seems
to
be
something
they
have
a
touch
for
very
well
done
once
again
the
name
leaves
me
curious
o
jacks
abby
continues
to
take
tasteless
styles
and
give
them
a
rebirth
putting
the
new
american
craft
spin
on
them
maybe
some
of
the
weaknesses
of
the
style
are
hidden
in
the
generous
hop
additions
but
regardless
its
another
wellcrafted
beer
i
rated
according
to
style
and
its
really
that
good

yet
another
hop
forward
lager
done
right
here
from
ja
tastes
alot
more
bitter
than
50
ibus
to
me
though
very
hop
assertive
and
compliments
the
noticeable
sweetness
sure
to
please
those
looking
for
a
quick
hop
fix
very
nice
variation
of
a
bock
with
an
awesome
taste
of
hops
poured
orange
into
a
snifter
its
head
a
nice
2
inches
and
lacing
lasting
until
the
end
never
one
to
like
too
many
hops
this
ibu
of
50
is
just
right
with
its
amber
color
and
maltiness
this
is
an
exceptional
lager
from
the
lager
heads
at
jacks
abby
who
know
how
to
treat
munch
malt
to
make
this
really
really
good
tasting
beer
thanks
guys
pours
a
clear
deep

with
a
huge
bubbly
beige
head
that
takes
forever
to
recede
smells
of
sweet
bready
caramel
with
a
spicy
earthy
mineral
edge
to
provide
some
balance
the
flavor
is
quite
sweet
which
threw
me
a
bit
until
i
noticed
that
the
beer
is
named
hopbock
not
hopback
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
bready
with
a
spicy
earthy
hop
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
spicy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
bock
style
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
this
is
a
nice
ipa
for
a
cold
night
with
just
enough
malt
heft
to
balance
out
the
hops
another
nice
brew
from
jacks
abby
o
i
really
like
this
beer
great
hop
aroma
and
flavor
rich
malt
backbone
that
holds
its
own
yet
not
palate
dominating
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
one
of
jacks
best
offerings
this
was
pretty
tough
to
classify
rate
beer
says
imperial
pilsner
with
munich
malts
though
i
definitely
consider
this
an
amber
or
red
maybe
an
india
red
lager
sounds
crazy
but
its
awesome
highly
recommended

on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
when
i
saw
the
dark
color
i
thought
it
would
be
more
hoppy
or
bitter
then
it
was
very
enjoyable
overall
very
nice
lager
flavorful
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
gladly
have
another
while
it
did
not
blow
me
away
it
was
a
very
solid
basic
craft
beer
overall
a
very
smooth
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
lager
from
coney
island
the
flavor
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
good
and
the
smooth
delivery
makes
it
all
the
better
does
this
come
in
sixers
either
this
was
a
bad
bottle
or
im
just
not
a
fan
ive
been
sick
of
ales
and
went
looking
for
some
high
quality
lagers
was
recommended
this
by
the
owner
of
the
craft
beer
store
where
i
shop
and
was
really
blown
away
by
the
mellow
smooth
taste
of
this
beer
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
dryness
adds
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
malty
sweetness
although
that
flavor
is
also
mild
a
great
addition
to
my
list
of
good
lagers
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
fruity
presence
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
flat
for
my
liking
pours
a
light
coppery
amber
with
around
two
fingers
of
light
butterscotch
foam
aroma
is
mellow
pilsner
malt
a
bit
of
toast
maybe
a
hint
of
green
apple
standard
lager
nose
palate
was
malt
galore
toasty
bread
sticks
and
some
citrus
pith
nice
hops
to
balance
the
malt
with
little
discernable
sweetness
hops
are
a
bit
peppery
vegetalherbal
perhaps
a
hint
of
rhubarb
sourness
a
metallic
ting
in
the
finish
i
am
an
ale
drinker
by
preference
but
this
sort
of
malty
hoppy
lager
makes
a
nice
change
of
pace
could
be
a
bit
sweeter
its
smooth
and
peaceful
sailin
from
here
on
out
with
a
cool
wind
bringing
up
the
aft
and
no
swells
in
sight
a
great
beer
to
celebrate
your
victories
and
reflect
on
your
defeats
with
look
this
is
the
beer
you
use
to
introduce
your
friends
to
the
better
beer
world
this
lager
is
the
most
refreshing
tasty
and
satisfying
lager
i
have
ever
had
this
one
has
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
that
balances
out
the
mouthfeel
perfectly
the
taste
is
still
a
lager
which
means
not
as
flavorful
as
an
ale
or
stout
but
this
is
much
better
than
bud
this
lager
is
very
unique
and
quite
tasty
it
is
a
fairly
hard
beer
to
obtain
around
here
or
i
might
drink
it
more
the
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
the
aroma
is
crisp
with
some
lemon
grain
grass
and
a
hint
of
caramel
it
tastes
bitter
up
front
with
pine
and
lemon
with
a
hint
of
grain
it
is
nice
and
refreshing
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
i
would
make
a
top
choice
if
it
was
widely
available
overall
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
and
this
was
sadly
disappointing
rjt
great
job
again
schmaltz
o
not
bad
by
any
means
but
it
doesnt
do
anything
new
or
interesting
o
while
i
gravitate
toward
ales
i
really
liked
this
lager
it
has
a
wealth
of
interesting
flavors
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
and
a
clean
finish
that
sits
satisfyingly
on
the
stomach
i
would
buy
again
especially
on
sale
at
kroger
for
3
75
o
a
decent
brew
not
you
normal
runofthemill
lager
i
generally
find
lagers
to
be
kind
of
plain
this
one
was
fantastic
i
randomly
picked
it
up
in
a
backwoods
grocery
store
22
and
was
happy
i
did
had
a
really
nice
caramelly
darkish
flavor
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
fantastic
really
good
beer
if
you
dont
want
something
heavy
but
cant
stand
light
cheap
tasting
beer
i
would
love
to
have
this
out
of
a
keg
since
i
heard
its
even
better
that
way
with
the
creepy
coneyisland
face
on
the
front
this
large
bottle
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
modest
white
head
good
clarity
the
aroma
has
a
little
malt
with
a
touch
of
wood
smoke
and
peppery
spice
its
not
a
usual
clean
lager
smell
the
flavor
is
of
light
and
amber
malt
a
bit
of
grain
and
twigs
interesting
the
beer
is
of
medium
body
with
a
lingering
hop
and
malt
mouthfeel
better
than
average
and
interesting
but
not
great
this
might
be
a
good
beer
in
the
right
setting
but
overall
nothing
too
spectacular
drinkability
decent
lager
to
add
to
the
rotation
but
difficult
to
find
here
ontap
this
beer
has
a
distinct
caramel
almost
burnt
caramel
taste
that
is
delicious
i
took
home
some
of
the
bottled
version
and
tasted
a
much
different
beer
the
bottle
had
only
a
hint
of
caramel
still
enjoyable
but
a
point
lower
overall
due
to
the
loss
of
flavor
compared
to
tap
this
is
a
pleasantly
crafted
amber
lager
easy
drinking
but
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting

that

overall
this
is

an
interesting
beer
like
most
of
the
shmaltz
offerings
its
definitely
an
offcenter
beer
whatever
style
you
call
this
quite
drinkable
and
pleasant
it
does
take
the
prize
for
one
of
the
wackiest
labels
ever
the

i
get
a
hit
of
the
czech
spice
on
toast
that
bleeds
into
orange
peels
and
a
nice
extended
resinous
finish
pretty
good
but
not
as
memorable
as
most
of
shmaltzs
other
products
imo
pretty
disappointing
brew
to
be
honest
ive
found
the
coney
island
branding
to
be
genuinely
substandard
to
the
hebrew
branded
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
worst
of
all
while
this
could
be
a
reasonable
session
brew
the
5
5
abv
puts
it
slightly
out
of
that
range
its
a
shame
drink
i
will
outwardly
admit
i
drank
this
a
few
years
ago
never
reviewed
it
and
am
only
drinking
this
for
the
style
tick
i
can
say
with
the
yeast
and
pils
and
malts
not
really
a
good
combo
for
me
i
liked
the
look
of
the
orangish
amber
color
this
gave
off
in
the
glass
it
seemed
to
lighten
up
toward
the
top
with
a
decent
head
that
retained
quite
a
bit
the
beer
has
some
hoppy
character
to
it
i
can
smell
it
all
over
the
nose
its
very
aromatic
imo
the
taste
was
mirror
to
the
smell
and
i
felt
a
rush
of
hops
about
halfway
and
up
to
the
finish
also
i
get
some
toasty
bread
in
the
their
up
front
and
continues
in
the
background
of
the
mouthful
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
pale
ale
which
obviously
this
is
an
amber
ale
id
give
the
hop
character
similar
or
a
little
stronger
to
that
of
a
sierra
nevada
it
definetly
stays
on
my
pallet
for
a
while
this
isnt
to
take
away
from
the
beer
although
i
think
i
prefer
the
hops
taste
to
take
a
more
conservative
role
in
a
beer
all
in
all
this
beer
is
decent
id
drink
it
again
but
i
think
id
stick
to
just
a
pint
or
so
and
move
on
to
something
else
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
ive
had
its
a
beer
that
is
perfect
for
any
occasion
thanks
to
its
easy
drinkability
and
flavor
its
a
well
rounded
beer
that
gets
the
job
done
postscript
apparently
its
not
a
pilsner
maybe
its
the
lagering
but
i
definitely
picked
up
on
hints
of
a
pilsnerlike
yeast
flavor
profile
this
is
really
a
tough
one
to
review
its
solid
in
every
way
shape
and
form
its
a
sweet
red
lager
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
on
the
finish
it
looks
fine
laces
fine
smells
fine
and
goes
down
easily
im
not
thrilled
by
it
at
all
though
especially
considering
the
price
it
commands
i
mean
its
alright
and
is
probably
a
solid
choice
on
tap
bottles
though
i
wouldnt
bother
a
pretty
good
beer
allaround
and
i
really
tried
to
downgrade
it
for
some
reason
give
it
a
try
carbonation
could
be
a
little
lower
o
ill
pass
on
this
next
time
really
cool
label
though
overall
i
didnt
care
for
it
too
much
reminded
me
of
an
amped

a
rich
amber
color
stiff
off

that
sits

enough
hop
to
dry

this
is

stuff
didnt

me
some
faire
food
and
something
to
wash
it
down
with
i
think
the
coney
island
name
fits
good
example
of
a
malty
east
coast
lager
pours
a
clear
copperhoney
with
a
giant
tan
foamy
head
there
is
a
ton
of
carbonation
in
this
beerso
be
careful
the
smell
is
pretty
strong
with
a
large
floral
aroma
with
sweet
malt
and
hops
the
taste
is
flavorful
with
sweet
maltbitter
hopsand
bread
yeast
the
mf
is
light
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
a
very
good
lager
i
can
see
myself
having
alot
of
these
i
finally
found
this
for
a
reasonable
price
3
49
a
bomber
and
im
glad
i
didnt
pay
more
than
that
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
its
too
reminiscent
of
sour
apple
candy
for
my
taste
d
a
little
hoppier
than
im
used
to
for
this
type
of
brew
but
very
nice
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
reminds
me
a
little
of
an
ipa
mixed
with
a
lager
well
balanced
worth
looking
into
when
poured
in
to
my
glass
it
had
a
decent
head
going
in
to
a
light
film
and
looks
are
a
like
reddish
brown
or
copper
color
and
good
carbonation
smell
was
sweet
and
you
could
tell
it
had
a
hint
of
toasted
grain
from
smell
taste
was
nice
and
crisp
malty
and
had
a
smooth
taste
of
sweet
and
taost
notes
great
after
taste
not
overpowering
drinkablity
is
good
and
recomend
more
than
one
bomber
bottle
d
easily
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
amber
lager
with
dominant
toasted
malt
notes
the
malt
character
is
not
nearly
as
rich
as
in
its
european
counterparts
and
the
dry
toasty
finish
eventually
turns
a
bit
astringent
worth
trying
dpretty
decent
drinkability
although
im
not
likely
to
reach
for
another
as
i
finish
this
up
definately
one
to
revisit
and
toss
back
on
a
summer
day
when
quenching
thirst
gets
higher
marks
than
complexity
i
had
this
beer
the
other
night
in
a
bomber
the
appearance
was
very
enticing
almost
looked
like
ice
tea
during
the
summer
the
smell
was
honey
and
citrus
the
taste
was
very
strong
in
honey
which
is
odd
that
i
dont
see
that
mentioned
in
a
lot
of
the
reviews
drinkability
for
this
is
very
high
and
i
wish
i
could
get
a
better
price
for
it
than
4

a
bomber
this
beer
would
be
fantastic
during
the
summer
while
i
have
a
bit
of
a
grudge
towards
them
schmaltz
offers
up
some
truly
good
beer
this
one
which
ive
had
on
draught
in
bottle
however
is
not
one
of
their
best
a
yellowy
golden
brown
pour
gives
to
nearly
no
head
or
lace
there
is
a
sweet
honeymalt
aroma
that
is
rounded
out
with
lemony
hops
in
the
tasting
a
bit
flat
bright
in
body
this
lager
serves
its
purpose
as
a
basic
lager
but
no
more
maybe
they
ought
to
serve
it
in
cans
further
drawing
out
the
retroconey
theme
not
what
i
expected
beer
form
coney
island
stinks
this
poured
with
a
dark
amber
color
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
odor
is
unremarkable
similar
to
and
macro
irish
red
taste
is
somewhat
pleasant

tea
and
just
a

goes
very
well
with

then
there
is
a
slow

sweetness
in
the
finish
that
linges
with
the
bubbly
carboation
geeat
dry
bubbly
malty
sweet
palate
makes
this
beer
insanely
drinkable
this
is
a
good
lager
that
mixes
hops
in
well
its
certainly
a
refreshing
lager
and
league
something
of
a
tingly
taste
on
the
mouth
its
a
very
solid
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
probably
have
another
i
had
the
opportunity
to
speak
with
one
of
their
salesman
at
a
beer
dinner
this
past
week
in
which
he
talked
about
coney
island
and
what
schmaltz
had
put
into
this
beer
im
certain
if
he
wouldnt
have
talked
about
this
beerbrand
i
probably
would
have
passed
it
by
a
little
pricey
but
well
worth
the
try
d
not
a
session
beer
but
very
nice
and
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
overall
delicious
3

for
a
bomber
and
well
worth
it
on
new
years
eve
i
drank
this
beer
on
tap
the
whole
night
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
really
easytodrink
beer
its
refreshing
pleasanttasting
and
smooth
i
agree
that
this
is
a
good
party
beer
because
it
works
on
its
own
as
a
crowdpleaser
all
my
friends
seemed
to
like
it
too
i
also
really
like
the
logo
all
in
all
a
good
beer
that
could
be
tweaked
a
bit
to
be
excellent
id
buy
it
again
though
it
definitely
sticks
out
among
the
lagers
on
your
average
grocery
store
shelf

overall
i
was
less

impressed
for
some

ive
always
steered
clear
of
schmaltz
and
now
i
know
why
this
wasnt
an
absolutely
terrible
beer
but
i
cant
see
myself
ever
ordering
one
of
these
again
ill
try
a
few
more
of
their
beers
but
i
hope
they
get
better
this
ones
an
easy

and
a
nice
example
of
a

recommended
i
find
this
beer
crisp
refreshing
and
flavorful
this
is
a
great
beer
drinking
beer
not
hoppy
just
malty
sweet
and
tasty
i
tend
to
use
this
beer
for
parties
because
it
doesnt
come
expecting
a
hardcore
beer

palate
like
a

might
and
the

perhaps

its
worth
a
shot
a
truly

amber
ale
is
that
an
oxymoron
should
be
sessionable
and
interesting
coney

really
only
brings
the
interesting
as
far
as
a

its

still

goes
down
smooth
a
pretty
tasty
quaffable
lager
drinks
easy
not
a
bad
attempt
at
the
style
well
the
farmhouse
wasnt
air
conditioned
and
the
fermentation
was
fast
so
i
heard
over
the
phone
i
wasnt
going
near
the
place
again
until
it
was
pickup
time
and
the
maker
thought
it
might
not
be
exactly
what
i
was
anticipating
and
he
was
right
it
was
sort
of
an
ale
lager
hybrid
kind
of
what
i
drinking
now
well
the
czech
amber
lager
ale
is
all
gone
but
i
still
have
10
years
later
one
bottle
of
the
second
case
oddly
enough
an
extract
barleywine
i
like
the
coney
a
little
more
now
on
second
thought
i
was
not
too
impressed
by
this
one
this
my
third
coney
island
offering
leaves
me
wondering
a
bit
about
these
wacky
labels
and
caps
may
give
it
shot
next
batch
that
comes
out
but
this
one
was
not
very
appealing
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
lager
and
one
of
my
personal
favorites
the
refreshing
taste
of
this
beer
never
gets
old
and
i
cant
think
of
many
beers
better
then
this
one
to
enjoy
after
a
long
day
at
work
during
a
meal
this
beer
will
succeed
both
in
quenching
your
thirst
and
not
filling
you
up
i
love
red
lagers
and
if
you
do
too
you
need
to
try
this
one
like
it
says
on
the
label
indulge
your
inner
beer
freak
amber

with
a
half

kills

crisp
easy

i
was
kind
of
reluctant
on
this
one
but
it
was
a
pleasant
supprise
i
recomend
it
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
traditional
czech
pils
not
much
like
a
red
the
hops
are
bit
more
varied
and
americantasting
than
you
might
find
in
say
urquell
or
prima
pils
this
is
a
nice
change
but
its
also
lacking
that
wonderful
dryness
that
a
really
great
pils
tends
to
have
and
this
complexity
of
the
hop
also
blots
out
the
malt
profile
just
a
smidge
still
very
tasty
and
nicely
balanced
but
not
quite
an
elite
beer
the
flavor
is
quite
good
with
a
malty
burst
of
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
that
gets
immediately
balanced
by
bitter
hops
the
hop
note
is
piney
and
resinous
and
rides
the
back
of
the
palate
for
quite
some
time
for
a
lager
this
packs
some
serious
flavor
and
its
a
welcome
change
from
the
lackluster
lager
offerings
ive
come
across
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
crisp
refreshing
and
all
of
the
above
a
joy
to
consume
a
bit
less
overbearing
than
schmaltzs
sword

at

pretty
interesting

pretty
present

malt
is
also
quite
present
in
the
taste
with
just
enough

coming
through
for
the
bizzare
make
up

was

but
a
bit
unusual
to
be
truly
refreshing
or
highly
drinkable
split
this
cool
looking
bomber
with
my
brotherinlaw
this
is
actually
a
great
lager
and
i
would
believe
that
it
is
made
with
quality
in
mind
it
was
balanced
sessionable
and
good
looking
however
i
think
because
of
the
czech
pilsner
yeast
it
has
a
minerally
bite
involved
that
i
simply
do
not
enjoy
theres
really
not
much
i
can
say
other
than
that
and
unfortunately
it
isnt
in
front
of
me
to
do
a
thorough
review
but
i
was
convinced
that
it
was
a
quality
american
lager
just
not
something
i
would
spend
the
money
to
get
again

a

of

lots

the
body
is
light
as
is
appropriate
quite
tasty
there
really
isnt
too
much
to
this
beer
but
its
pretty
refreshing
i
doubt
the
brewers
were
trying
to
make
anything
extreme
though
this
does
come
from
the
same
brewing
company
that
makes
the
10
abv
jewbelalation
series
recommended
a
great
lager
very
refreshing
even
though
it
has
a
more
dynamic
flavor
profile
than
what
is
typical
for
most
lagers
i
have
sampled
a
bit
expensive
so
that
limits
sessionability
easy
to
drink
but
far
from
impressive
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
lager
thats
trying
to
be
an
ipa
and
it
combined
the
best
qualities
of
both
styles
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
overall
impression
i
generally
drink
ipas
imperial
stouts
and
belgians
in
general
ive
avoided
lagers
for
a
long
time
im
trying
to
get
over
the
stigma
ive
put
on
the
lager
side
with
that
i
have
to
say
while
its
not
as
complex
as
i
am
used
to
it
has
a
very
nice
flavor
and
it
is
very
drinkable
there
is
just
enough
hop
flavor
to
tie
it
back
with
more
familiar
and
loved
beers
but
it
is
still
distinctly
a
lager
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
and
at
5
5
abv
i
think
i
could
put
a
couple
of
these
bombers
down
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
medium
lived
whitish
head
smell
is
lightly
grassy
and
pale
maltiness
taste
is
perhaps
a
bit
hoppy
for
a
lager
malty
medium
bodied
and
a
full
flavored
nice
lager
perhaps
a
touch
lemony
as
well
not
offensive
is
easy
drinking
and
pretty
solid
for
what
it
is
very
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
this
in
a
six
pack
and
this
will
become
a
regular
of
mine
now
i
normally
dont
trust
my
nose
that
much
but
my
buddy
sharing
this
beer
with
me
didnt
smell
much
of
anything
either
which
was
pretty
surprising
considering
the
flavors
going
on
didnt
hinder
my
experience
in
the
slightest
though
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
having
more
in
the
future
d
enjoyable
but
i
think
the
22
oz
of
this
will
be
enough
as
i
said
its
pretty
heavy
for
a
lager
but
either
way
its
nice
going
down
worth
a
shot
if
youre
looking
for
a
lager
thats
slightly
different
d
all
the
flavors
i
love
from
an
ale
are
put
into
a
lager
with
a
really
clean
taste
and
an
unoffensive
finish
despite
the
loads
of
hops
honestly
i
never
would
have
expected
this
flavor
profile
this
is
my
first
beer
from
schmaltz
and
i
am
definitely
gonna
seek
out
some
more
of
their
offerings
wow
nice
lager
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
just
a
whisper
of
fruit
banana
on
second
examination
color
is
a
dark
honeyamber
not
like
your
typical
lager
and
with
a
nice
thick
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
flavor
is
smooth
malty
with
a
fair
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
trace
of
fruit
hop
flavor
dominates
the
aftertaste
this
is
rather
different
from
what
i
expect
when
drinking
a
lager
on
tap
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
light
amber
with
lots
of
bubble
columns
the
aroma
showcases
an
unusual
hoppiness
for
a
lager
sweeter
citrus
fruit
comes
through
alongside
the
more
classic
earthy
saaz
the
flavor
has
a
nice
maltiness
that
is
part
caramel
and
part
cookie
the
hops
are
mostly
leafy
and
herbal
but
some
of
the
citrus
from
the
smell
is
detectable
body
is
heftier
than
expected
for
the
style
but
this
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkabilitynot
great
not
wretched
flavor
is
rich
malts
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
sulfur
toasted
biscuits
and
french
bread
hops
are
mildly
sprucey
but
balance
out
nicely
with
the
malts
hop
flavor
linger
around
the
tongue
well
after
each
sip
light
mouthfeel
very
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
summer
day
would
not
mind
getting
my
hands
on
a
few
more
bottles
of
these
drinkability
overall
a
good
lager
to
try
very
much
within
the
style
a
great
lager
and
with
8
malts
and
6
hops
whats
not
to
like
smooth
enticing
and
develops
quite
nicely
longer
finish
than
most
lagers
have
too
poured
into
a
pint
glass
hazy
amber
with
a
thin
but
alluring
headgood
retention
very
nice
nose
caramel
malt
pine
and
maybe
fig
flavor
is
less
distinct
but
a
good
balance
of
caramel
malt
mild
hop
spicinesswith
a
clean
finish
medium
carbonation
goes
down
easy
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beverage
if
i
were
blindfolded
i
would
swear
that
this
is
an
ale
i
would
happily
serve
this
to
my
beer
geek
friends
and
tell
them
it
is
a
mild
american
amber
dont
drink
and
review
pours
a
clear
copperish
dark
amber
with
nice
offwhite
head
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
smells
of
floral
hops
citrus
and
honey
tastes
of
lemon
and
sweet
caramel
with
a
firm
bread
and
butter
backbone
and
a
slight
alcohol
grapefruit
and
pine
finish
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
sweet
and
malty
smooth
with
a
bitter
crisp
finish
low
in
abv
and
easy
to
drink
nice
to
session
for
those
who
love
malty
sweetness
and
a
crisp
hop
finish
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
a
slightly
spicy
smell
accompanied
a
caramel
sweetness
like
an
american
macro
lager
on
the
nose
only
a
little
more
complex
there
was
a
very
nice
balance
of
caramel
malts
and
american
hops
along
with
a
certain
spiciness
to
the
flavor
it
was
a
smooth
beer
for
the
type
most
of
these
lagers
just
have
so
much
bitterness
and
bit
like
other
lagers
that
i
avoid
them
this
one
put
the
l
in
lager
d
its
a
good
but
not
spectacular
drinker
it
was
a
little
heavier
than
i
expected
keeping
it
from
being
a
really
sessionable
beer
d
i
think
that
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
better
beer
in
this
category
the
alcohol
is
tame
and
so
i
would
be
able
to
have
a
couple
of
bottles
easily
without
passing
out
i
recommend
this
american
amber
lager
highly
poured
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
2
pours
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
with
a
light
creamy
head
that
leaves
just
a
slight
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
malty
up
front
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
come
out
followed
by
a
slight
buttery
smell
there
is
also
just
a
slight
hint
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
sweet
but
has
a
descent
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
caramel
is
pretty
prevalent
up
front
there
is
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
that
comes
out
from
the
hop
presence
brown
sugar
and
molasses
definitely
come
out
also
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
medium
bodied
with
just
a
slight
carbonation
while
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
red
lager
it
really
isnt
what
i
expected
it
to
be
there
is
a
lot
more
flavor
than
what
i
expect
from
most
this
is
a
really
good
beer
decent
but
certainly
not
aboveandbeyond
deasy
session
brew
overall
not
a
bad
session
lager
at
all
really
quite
good
actually
and
went
very
well
with
dinner
i
was
very
happy
with
the
way
this
one
turned
out
and
it
was
nice
to
see
that
they
could
put
together
a
quality
session
ale
as
well
as
some
of
the
bigger
offerings
they
make
i
would
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
also
as
a
side
growing
up
in
jersey
the
label
brought
back
some
fun
memories
really
interesting
little
beer
here
and
definitely
worth
a
further
look
get
your
lager
here
lager
get
your
lager
here
outstandingly
good
drinkability
here
pretty
much
an
ultimate
lawnmower
beer
and
one
of
the
best
american
lagers
i
have
had
in
months
highly
recommended
drinkability
easy
to
drink
ale
here
not
overwhelming
but
a
simple
session
beer
overall
this
is
definitely
a
big
lager
compared
to
other
styles
for
the
price
i
was
hoping
for
some
more
complexity
still
a
fine
beer
and
you
cant
beat
the
cause
the
22
oz
bomber
was
adorned
with
a
label
befitting
a
funhouse
theme
i
associate
with
coney
island
although
i
have
never
been
there
personally
the
beer
came
out
orange
amber
in
color
with
some
chill
haze
carbonation
was
fine
and
gentle
which
made
me
wonder
if
this
was
bottle
conditioned
the
aroma
was
very
toasty
and
caramelized
and
was
layered
with
a
follow
up
smell
of
spicy
noble
hops
the
taste
was
well
balanced
between
the
simple
bready
sweetness
of
caramel
malts
and
surprisingly
bitter
hops
not
watery
like
most
vienna
lagers
this
was
a
flavorful
and
caressing
treat
went
fabulously
with
a
plate
of
indian
cashews
and
marcona
almonds
its
okay
enough
to
drink
the
whole
bomber
but
sorry
not
a
big
fan
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
and
refreshing
and
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
quaff
picked
this
up
in
a
22
oz
bomber
from
dans
buyrite
caught
my
eye
for
its
bargain
basement
pricing
and
the
shmaltz
reputation
for
quality
this
beer
is
a
lager
but
i
did
not
drink
it
ice
cold
but
more
at
the
ale
temp
imbibed
from
a
wine
glass
did
not
disappoint
highly
quaffable
with
a
low
abv
5
5
this
beer
had
that
je
ne
sais
quois
that
just
made
you
want
more
and
more
maybe
it
was
the
hypnotic
stare
of
the
clown
on
the
bottle
or
maybe
this
is
just
one
of
the
most
drinkable
amber
lagers
ive
ever
had
less
hoppy
but
more
balanced
than
that
sam
adams
stuff
makes
me
want
to
go
the
coney
island
kudos
to
shmaltz
drinkability
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
and
while
i
can
tolerate
a
sam
adams
if
nothing
else
is
available
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
pours
a
dark
clear
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
smells
malty
and
sweet
with
some
hoppy
notes
the
taste
starts
sweet
and
malty
and
finishes
somewhat
hoppy
with
some
spice
thrown
in
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
great
balance
in
flavors
with
multiple
layers
a
very
impressive
lager
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
creative
flavors
and
an
interesting
break
from
the
usual
worth
checking
out
its
pretty
cool
that
some
of
the
proceeds
go
to
the
coney
island
fund
we
need
some
freaks
left
in
this
world
ill
be
looking
to
buy
more
of
this
one
especially
in
the
warmer
months
drinkability
i
forget
what
i
paid
for
this
but
if
its
not
too
much
id
love
to
share
some
of
these
around
this
summer
a
delightful
find
notes
at
almost
5
per
22
oz
bottle
i
cant
see
any
reason
to
seek
this
out
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
drinkability
that
being
said
i
defy
any
person
with
a
soul
to
not
enjoy
this
vienna
the
first
time
i
became
aware
of
this
beer
was
on
a
hot
sunday
afternoon
last
august
when
i
saw
bottles
of
this
for
sale
at
the
coney
island
freakshow
but
they
had
just
sold
out
well
let
me
tell
you
this
would
have
been
a
perfect
beer
for
that
hot
summer
day
with
a
nice
fresh
crisp
taste
and
easy
drinkibility
this
would
have
gone
down
very
nicely
and
it
still
does
even
as
i
sit
here
on
a
cold
ass
day
in
january
being
heavily
involved
in
architecture
and
urban
design
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
this
beer
go
toward
the
stabilization
and
preservation
of
coney
island
thanks
matt
notes
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
combination
of
a
zippy
carbonation
and
solid
hop
bill
really
snaps
this
thing
together
22
oz
glass
bottle
color
of
amber
with
a
medium
tan
colored
head
nose
of
mild
malts
some
soapiness
and
subtle
hops

taste
of
pale
hops
ever
so
slight
malts
and
very
mild
soap
body
is
dry
and
light
and
with
medium
high
carbonation

aftertaste
of
mild

bitter
and
dry
had
this
one
at
the
cask
festival
at
the
brazen
head
a
few
months
ago
transcribing
off
of
notes
pours
a
clear
orange
amber
nose
is
grainy
flavor
is
a
bit
more
nutty
than
i
remember
off
the
bottle
nice
smooth
feel
with
a
definite
silky
edge
very
nice
drinker
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
mildly
flavorful
too
much
sweetness
in
this
one
is
the
first
thing
noticed
cloying
on
the
almost
hops
help
to
tame
the
rs
on
the
middle
leaving
only
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
taking
abandon
to
the
malt
malts
tastes
exactly
how
the
nose
was
described
thick
with
cereal
grain
toffee
and
caramel
with
that
similar
graham
cracker
flavor
mouth
is
a
little
thin
as
well
if
this
wasnt
quite
as
sweet
it
would
be
much
better
a
decent
beer
and
happy
to
try
it
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
bit
more
balanced
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
red
lager
but
not
anything
special
sinkability

a
stain
on
the
coney
island
name
overall
a
good
entry
in
the
lager
category
a
genre
that
needs
more
unique
and
compelling
beers
the
bottom
line
a
decent
take
on
the
czech
pilsener
style
nothing
particularly
remarkable
though
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
14
beige
head
over
the
clear
amber
brew
head
fades
slowly
with
sporadic
bits
of
lasting
lace
aroma
is
lightly
malty
with
some
floral
hops
character
taste
is
biscuity
malt
upfront
nicely
balanced
with
ample
fresh
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
soft
with
quite
nice
drinkability
nice
pilsstyle
with
a
bit
more
oomph
in
the
malt
area
easy
enough
to
drink
this
one
is
meant
to
slug
down
and
not
put
too
much
thought
into
it
d
the
malt
is
a
bit
soft
in
the
smell
but
has
some
nice
flavor
there
is
a
good
complexity
to
the
grain
bill
with
some
big
bitterness
at
the
finish
it
sounds
exciting
but
i
just
found
this
beer
a
bit
boring
overall
a
very
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
beer
however
the
beer
drank
more
like
a
vienna
lager
than
a
pils
final
note
cool
bottle
label
bottle
from
city
wide
in
south
bend
pours
orange
to
terracotta
lacy
doilylike
head
is
khaki
to
offwhite
in
color
looks
surprizingly
dark
for
what
i
was
expecting
smells
buttery
and
tangy
notes
of
lemons
and
brussel
sprouts
taste
is
more
bitter
than
expected
like
an
apa
slightly
sweet
malty
flavor
with
distinct
hop
bite
not
too
crazy
but
admittedly
unusual
in
its
presentation
medium
bodied
a
good
drinker
but
nothing
special
i
dont
think
not
really
a
czech
pilsener
pretty
thin
all
the
character
is
wrapped
up
in
the
caramel
d
based
on
the
description
on
the
bottle
i
thought
this
beer
might
be
a
bit
of
a
mess
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
will
look
for
other
beers
in
this
series
i
dont
believe
this
would
make
a
regular
rotation
in
my
fridge
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
at
4
99
per
22
oz
bottle
a
little
pricy
for
my
beer
budget
d
perhaps
not
the
typical
pilsner
but
quite
drinkable
enjoyable
flavor
plenty
of
both
hops
and
malts
label
says
there
6
hops
and
8
malts
in
this
beer
jeremy
cowan
youve
again
broken
the
mold
on
what
to
expect
from
certain
styles
while
this
may
not
be
the
most
drinkable
smoothest
pilsner
ive
ever
had
its
definitely
one
id
have
again
and
will
recommend
this
label
should
be
on
a
tshirt
have
no
idea
how
this
22
oz
bottle
made
its
way
to
a
small
grocery
store
in
salemoregon
lovely
looking
lager
dark
copper
with
a
large
tan
head
great
laceing
throught
the
galss
aroma
i
wasnt
so
pleased
with
its
sort
of
maltynutty
but
with
some
off
putting
cheesy
sock
thing
going
on
nice
taste
to
strong
on
the
malts
dark
and
semibitter
with
a
great
zing
of
grassysherberty
hops
near
the
end
pleasant
hop
aftertaste
nice
mouthfeel
to
this
one
smooth
under
the
well
done
carbonation
i
thought
this
wasnt
a
czech
pils
but
a
very
drinkable
vienna
very
nice
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
czech
pilsener
from
the
czech
republic
because
it
has
those
west
coast
hops
still
it
is
a
very
good
lager
too
big
i
think
thats
why
i
like
it
i
kind
of
with
this
came
in
a
smaller
bottle
towards
the
end
i
was
getting
a
little
tired
of
it
still
glad
i
sampled
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
orange
amber
body
with
a
healthy
almond
head
that
is
creamy
and
well
retained
some
patchy
lace
left
on
the
glass
aroma
of
spicy
hops
toasted
caramel
and
fruity
pear
esters
medium
body
and
carbonation
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
earthy
spicy
hop
bitterness
and
toasty
caramel
maltiness
a
hint
of
red
apple
in
the
middle
very
approachable
but
not
a
pilsner
i
picked
this
up
since
i
liked
lennys
ripa
but
was
pretty
disappointed
by
this
beer
its
definitely
nowhere
near
a
czech
pilsner
so
that
amplifies
my
disappointment
i
just
dont
like
the
tealike
hop
flavors
of
this
beer
coney
island
lager
is
the
first
in
a
series
of
sideshow
inspired
lagers
from
shmaltz
thats
certainly
an
interesting
theme
for
a
brewery
to
pick
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
go
to
coney
island
usa
an
organization
founded
to
defend
the
honor
of
lost
forms
of
american
popular
arts
and
culture
although
it
isnt
outstanding
beer
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
go
and
im
glad
i
could
contribute
a
little
something
to
a
worthy
cause
great
label
and
a
worthy
cause
save
coney
island
but
the
beer
is
too
sweet
for
my
money
all
malt
backbone
chewy
and
bready
without
a
noticeable
hop
edge
good
color
great
bottle
and
fun
to
drink
anyway
if
youre
not
a
hophead
like
me
you
might
love
it
the
taste
reminded
me
much
of
a
steam
beer
there
was
a
very
nice
balance
of
caramel
malts
and
american
hops
along
with
a
certain
spiciness
to
the
flavor
it
is
an
incredibly
smooth
beer
and
an
incredibly
easy
drinker
im
always
a
little
gun
shy
about
american
lagers
but
this
one
was
really
quite
good
if
i
can
find
a
six
pack
of
this
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
it
copper
crystal
clear
copper
head
is

easy

maltiness
on
the

fairly

overall
though
there
is
a
bitterness
that
is
noticeable
caramel
and
toffee
the
flavors
of
note
a
little
spiciness
and
a
bit
of
a
dryness
on
the
finish
overall
a
decent
beer
its
no
knock
out
of
the
park
but
it
has
a
wellcrafted
nature
that
suits
it
well
and
is
comfortable
for
drinking
this
is
a
nice
lager
its
definitely
not
like
a
traditional
american
craft
lager
though
as
others
have
said
it
definitely
has
more
of
a
pils
thing
going
for
it
all
in
all
quite
nice
i
just
wish
this
came
in
smaller
bottles
hail
freaks
geeks
barkers
and
carnies
fairly
lightbodied
but
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
good
beer
goes
down
easy
smooth
and
very
light
would
drink
23
with
good
quality
hot
dogs
use
1
to
boil
the
dogs
in
for
a
large
corporate
beer
cant
knock
it
it
is
good
overall
sometimes
i
think
ab
wants
to
delve
into
craft
brewing
this
would
be
like
dipping
your
big
toe
into
the
deep
end
of
the
pool
its
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
does
not
go
far
enough
for
me
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
unlike
sam
adams
boston
lager
just
not
as
good
since
there
are
better
options
available
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
this
drinks
with
evident
adjuncts
like
a
corn
sweetness
and
crisp
rice
but
it
has
an
additional
caramel
malt
flavor
the
finish
is
rather
bitter
and
tinny
and
theres
an
overwhelming
metallic
bubblegum
taste
overall
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
comes
in
talls
good
alcohol
content
a
working
mans
brew
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
the
usual
carbonation
level
crisp
and
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
syrup
in
the
finish
overall
an
excellent
alternative
to
most
macro
lagers
good
price
point
as
well
so
far
not
craft
level
but
more
in
the
crafty
style
reminds
me
of
ab
black
crown
thats
my
rating
im
no
beer
snob
im
not
a
taster
im
an
average
guy
whos
more
into
beers
than
the
next
average
guy
16
oz
can
into
a
pint
mug
what
a
find
but
seriously
for
the
price
this
might
be
the
best
beer
out
there
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
money
so
i
cant
drink
highend
craft
365
daysyear
this
is
a
definite
step
above
all
of
the
other
crap
and
a
slight
bit
better
than
pbr
which
was
my
previous
cheap
goto
crap
it
has
possibly
been
replaced
if
i
could
rate
this
for
value
id
rate
it
4
755
it
is
like
a
cheaper
watered
down
sa
boston
lager
very
inoffensive
and
accessible
pours
a
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
very
quickly
subsides
to
barely
a
thin
lace
the
smelltaste
have
some
maltiness
with
no
noticeable
adjuncts
present
i
sensed
just
the
slightest
amount
of
alcohol
heat
but
not
enough
to
detract
from
the
overall
flavor
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thin
and
the
finish
is
very
neutral
the
carbonation
level
is
quite
low
overall
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
get
this
is
a
awesome
tasting
beer
now
all
of
us
are
hook
on
it
for
parties
not
the
worst
beer
of
all
time
but
has
slight
metallic
taste
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
light
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
caramel
taste
is
light
and
mild
malts
some
sweetness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
but
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
taste
has
a
little
more
toasted
malt
than
regular
busch
but
other
than
that
i
really
dont
get
much
else
that
differs
i
like
busch
for
an
aal
and
will
reach
for
one
at
the
ice
trough
on
a
hot
day
at
the
gas
station
over
any
other
bargain
beers
this
is
a
fine
addition
to
the
lineup
and
with
a
5
7
abv
tag
im
game
i
have
trouble
rating
this
as
an
amber
lager
this
isnt
all
that
good
compared
to
the
craftier
versions
but
as
an
adjunct
lager
priced
as
one
it
kicks
a
fair
amount
of
ass
im
fairly
impressed
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
ab
has
attempted
to
make
an
upgrade
to
their
busch
beer
and
it
is
not
bad
wont
be
confused
with
many
craft
beers
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
deecent
to
quote
bubbles
my
new
favorite
affordable
brew
just
saw
this
at
walmart
last
week
and
thought
id
take
a
chance
we
love
it
im
not
really
into
the
dark
or
flavored
beers
and
hubby
hates
them
this
is
what
were
drinking
now
and
are
looking
fora
place
that
sells
it
by
the
case
for
8
99
a
12
pack
in
the
bottle
at
5
7
abv
with
a
nice
finish
pretty
good
brew
and
better
than
many
microbrewscraft
beer
on
the
market
it
and
michelob
amberbock
have
a
lot
of
similarities
even
some
of
my
high
hop
bitter
grapefruit
aftertaste
enjoying
friends
were
enjoying
this
one
so
up
front
you
got
a
really
decent
amber
malt
profile
and
that
gives
way
to
a
graininess
thats
distinct
to
busch
and
thats
objectively
not
bad
only
it
tastes
like
busch
and
i
dumbly
associate
that
with
a
lack
of
quality
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
drinking
even
in
spite
of
my
stupid
prejudices
i
confess
i
recently
bought
a
riding
lawn
mower
and
lawn
mower
beers
have
lost
some
of
their
appeal
but
the
good
news
is
this
is
a
beer
with
enough
body
and
taste
to
make
me
take
note
after
acknowledging
its
relatively
low
cost
not
one
i
will
be
having
with
the
guys
at
a
tasting
but
a
solid
beer
for
household
chores
and
what
not
o
for
the
price
i
may
have
found
my
new
cheap
beer
since
i
usually
grab
a
case
of
high
life
light
as
my
cheap
beer
choice
ill
try
em
side
by
side
before
the
final
verdict
nothing
to
complain
about
but
also
nothing
to
brag
about
much
better
than
miller
fortune
or
bud
black
certainly
not
a
great
beer
but
it
has
its
place
price
seemed
on
the
cheaper
side
ill
be
curious
to
see
if
this
is
still
being
made
a
year
from
now
my
hunch
is
it
wont
this
is
at
least
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
a
cheap
beer
it
has
a
high
alcohol
content
and
great
for
a
cheap
buzz
or
drunk
if
you
drink
the
whole
6pack
poured
in
a
weizen
glass
it
produces
a
large
head
but
provides
little
to
no
retention
of
the
carbonation
in
the
brew
meaning
this
sucker
goes
flat
faster
than
you
can
drink
it
lines
of
froth
on
on
the
glass
do
not
stick
as
with
other
lagers
in
my
honest
opinion
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
consumed
from
the
can
and
while
tastes
good
for
the
first
sip
when
poured
does
not
live
long
outside
of
it
o
not
bad
for
a
big
brewer
better
than
black
crown
but
not
as
good
as
yuengling
overall
this
seems
like
an
amber
bock
on
steroids
a
beefy
cool
weather
lager
its
pretty
flawless
but
also
sort
of
dull
never
was
a
fan
of
abs
malt
liqour
lineup
but
this
is
ok
this
is
okay
i
think
i
might
like
it
better
if
it
was
warmer
out
and
i
was
more
thirsty
as
it
falls
closest
to
a
lawnmower
beer
prior
to
trying
this
my
philosophy
on
busch
was
why
drink
it
when
you
can
eat
it
presentation
packaged
in
a
sixteen
ounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
a
nice
drinking
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
and
again
easy
drinking
carbonation
upfront
then
some
nice
malt
little
to
no
hops
the
beer
starts
bubbly
then
has
flat
finish
as
the
beer
warms
it
takes
on
a
more
flat
less
peppy
way
uninteresting
beer
though
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
it
has
a
kick
after
only
half
the
can
good
for
huntin
and
fishin
room
temp
tastes
bland
but
cold
its
really
good
pours
a
clear
coppergolden
color
15
inch

of
an
offwhite
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
slight
hops
slight
sweet
malt
pale
malt
corn
and
slight
metallic
fits
the
style
of
an
american
amber
red
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
hint
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
hops
slight
corn
and
hint
of
metallic
overall
better
than
regular
busch
but
still
not
much
to
rave
about
here
o
one
of
the
best
adjunct
beers
ive
had
in
many
a
moon
most
beers
get
worse
the
longer
they
sit
this
one
gets
a
little
sweeter
nice
great
beer
for
the
price
ab
finally
gets
one
right
overall
im
not
gonna
lie
i
liked
this
probably
more
than
my
objective
score
suggests
it
has
a
nice
toasty
taste
and
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
this
is
a
good
cheap
beer
with
flavor
in
other
words
othis
might
have
been
considered
a
breakthrough
beer
by
a
big
brewery
30
years
ago
hell
i
think
even
killians
is
better
but
not
today
there
is
no
need
for
this
beer
in
the
marketplace
i
like
busch
as
aals
go
but
this
doesnt
even
live
up
to
the
busch
name
it
does
not
taste
awful
well
what
little
taste
there
is
is
akin
to
flat
cola
will
not
buy
nor
drink
this
again

aroma

flavor
is

on
the
sweet
side
the
toasted

is
faint

noticeable
and
welcome
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
astringent
overall
it
is
the
first
product
with
the
busch
label
that
i
consider
a
good
call
best
beer
for
its
price
class
too
rjt
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
finally
a
decent
amber
from
one
of
the
giants
the
color
on
the
pour
was
great
and
the
head
wasnt
half
bad
after
that
it
went
downhill
the
taste
was
fizzy
like
someone
took
a
good
beer
and
put
seltzer
water
in
it
no
back
taste
nothing
i
would
like
for
the
internationals
to
brew
a
decent
beer
here
in
the
states
instead
of
trying
to
keep
an
american
flavor
that
bring
this
wv
boy
some
nostalgia
competing
with
fellow
high
school
friends
to
who
can
finish
their
30
pack
of
busch
first
tag
team
edition
of
course
that
will
hurt
you
the
next
day
my
digestive
tract
has
never
been
right

it
has

added

for
an
ab
brew
i
am
impressed
better
than
budlight
and
for
cheaper
better
than
original
busch
and
for
the
same
price
i
was
able
to
try
this
obviously
my
expectations
werent
extraordinarily
high
but
i
was
real
pleased
none
of
that
nasty
aftertaste
that
you
find
with
most
beers
busch
included
at
this
price
point
for
a
low
profile
rollout
i
can
pretty
much
step
out
on
the
limb
and
say
it
will
hang
with
the
more
expensive
darker
amber
brews
marksmith86feb

or
are
already
a
fan
of
yuengling
amber
read
that
we
were
in
a
test
market
area
in
an
article
so
i
picked
up
a
6
of
pounders
for
7
in
the
name
of
science
pours
as
advertised
in
color
smells
like
most
adjunct
lagers
not
much
of
anything
ill
be
damned
it
actually
tastes
pretty
good
considerably
better
than
budweiser
no
fizzy
metallic
aftertaste
a
little
bready
carmel
maltiness
going
on
i
actually
think
it
is
almost
as
good
as
yuengling
based
on
the
abv
and
price
point
it
may
be
one
of
the
better
options
when
you
are
ready
to
throw
down
on
a
summer
night
while
playing
cornhole
or
looking
for
a
tall
boy
at
the
gas
station
wow
all
i
can
say
is
wow
dont
get
me
wrong
this
isnt
a
top
quality
brew
but
i
just
cant
believe
that
something
with
busch
on
the
label
actually
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
brew
definitely
and
without
a
doubt
worth
a
try
o
it
is
a
pleasant
surprise
it
has
some
decent
flavor
and
im
a
homer
for
busch
hey
my
mom
named
me
buschbeer
so
i
have
some
sentimentality
for
it
busch
signature
copper
is
not
your
average
busch
beer
this
is
a
a
lot
darker
in
color
this
brew
pours
out
a
rich
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
not
a
light
amber
as
other
busch
beers
being
5
7
abv
witch
is
high
than
busch
being
4
6
abv
and
busch
ice
at
5
9
the
smell
is
rich
with
grins
and
malts
the
taste
is
bold
with
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
clean
this
brew
has
a
lot
going
on
in
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
this
is
one
busch
beer
that
i
would
write
home
about
great
brew
for
the
money
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
5
out
5
o
not
bad
its
decently
drinkable
for
a
negligible
and
worth
it
price
increase
over
buschbusch
light
i
could
see
this
being
a
goto
pickup
when
the
occasion
calls
for
cheap
tallboys
overall
this
is
surprisingly
similar
to
budweiser
darker
malt
flavors
along
with
the
light
crisp
easy
drinking
qualities
of
a
light
beer
i
know
its
not
a
world
class
beer
but
when
you
combine
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
sold
at
busch
prices
is
5
7
abv
and
has
just
a
touch
of
darker
flavors
its
a
winning
combo
nice
and
sweet
ive
had
beers
with
honey
in
them
before
that
are
decent
but
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
its
just
dull
and
not
all
that
enjoyable
it
is
not
horrible
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
i
would
probably
turn
it
down
even
it
was
offered
for
free
d
yeah
i
can
drink
this
this
is
an
interesting
variation
on
honey
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
d
i
actually
enjoy
a
sixer
of
these
on
occasion
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
grainy
taste
is
a
macro
with
honey
sweetness
pretty
smooth
and
refreshing
a
perfect
beer
for
a
summer
day
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
this
is
something
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
d
well
done
and
reasonably
balanced
great
for
what
it
is
a
sort
of
gateway
brew
nice
and
drinkable
and
actually
pretty
damn
fair
drinks
terrible
drainpour
i
got
a
third
of
the
way
through
it
and
realized
i
had
other
beers
in
the
fridge
so
why
waste
precious
seconds
of
my
life
consuming
this
beer
swill
would
be
a
complement
golden
and
transparent
paper
thin
head
sticks
around
about
as
long
as
a
leaf
in
a
hurricane
smells
of
bread
grains
and
rice
tastes
of
white
bread
rice
and
an
artifical
honey
sweetness
the
small
amount
of
sweet
flavor
is
enough
to
vastly
overpower
any
hints
of
bitterness
present
in
this
beer
light
and
watery
in
feel
lots
of
bubbles
not
a
brew
i
would
drink
often
very
little
flavor
or
complexity
sampled
on
october
11
2010
the
pour
is
fairly
typical
for
a
honey
ale
with
an
orange
tone
and
a
shortlasting
fizzy
white
head
that
bubbles
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
full
of
honey
and
malts
the
taste
is
about
the
same
there
is
nothing
special
going
on
here
atmosphere
is
okay
nothing
special
in
terms
of
appearance
or
nose
flavor
follows
suit
a
bit
a
bittersweet
palette
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
overall
another
i
will
have
to
pass
on
just
not
doing
it
for
me
at
all
taste
goes
downhill
quick
funny
aftertaste
from
whatever
honey
they
are
using
doesnt
do
well
with
the
high
carbonation
just
a
fizzy
honey
aftertaste
and
corn
left
over
a
neat
beer
to
smell
but
not
much
else
going
on
here
noteworthy
overall
a
missed
opportunity
a
little
less
sweetness
would
make
this
enjoyable
not
a
bad
honey
lager
it
tastes
like
well
honey
which
also
provides
the
benefit
of
distracting
from
the
otherwise
mediocre
amber
lager
underlying
things
for
all
the
weakass
honey
aleslagers
that
ive
had
over
the
years
that
hardly
have
a
whiff
of
honey
essence
and
sweetness
to
them
now
i
get
pretty
close
to
the
real
deal
from
ab
will
wonders
never
cease
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
honey
with
some
grain
notes
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
honey
but
i
also
get
some
banana
and
grain
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
great
but
not
terrible
md
way
carbonated
so
that
kills
the
mouthfeel
but
its
light
so
its
easy
to
drink
so
guys
if
ur
wife
girlfriend
other
does
not
really
enjoy
beer
give
this
one
a
shot
duh
a
good
beer
for
those
afraid
of
beer
this
is
my
unsung
hero
of
the
year
the
only
question
i
have
is
have
i
allowed
the
other
reviews
to
cause
me
to
underestimate
the
beer
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
other
that
being
a
bmc
get
over
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
smells
like
honey
syrup
and
some
grains
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
easily
drinkable
carbonation
level
is
decent
wow
this
is
a
really
sweet
beer
tons
of
honeysweetnes
puckering
candy
sweet
not
much
for
beerflavor
in
this
one
no
hops
no
grains
nothing
not
my
thing
the
michelob
brand
is
capable
of
making
solid
beers
but
did
not
do
so
here
fail
will
not
drink
again
an
absolute
chore
and
i
think
im
giving
up
this
beer
has
a
deep
golden
clear
honey
color
i
get
the
impression
they
used
artifical
coloring
to
make
looks
as
much
like
honey
as
possible
smell
is
overwhelmingly
sweet
honey
with
a
few
floral
characteristics
the
sweetness
is
the
dominant
force
though
this
is
undrinkable
it
tastes
as
if
someone
took
a
bottle
of
michelob
poured
a
third
of
it
out
filled
the
bottle
with
honey
and
put
the
cap
back
on
thats
probably
not
too
far
from
the
truth
it
just
horrible
sticky
disgusting
sweet
and
nothing
else
avoid
it
like
grim
death
god
what
a
waste
of
perfectly
good
honey
the
after
taste
is
where
the
honey
is
most
notable
it
basically
feels
like
your
tongue
is
covered
in
a
thin
layer
of
it
very
sweet
it
has
a
very
nice
appearance
an
head
id
probably
drink
it
again
but
a
bit
to
sweet
for
something
to
drink
regularly
when
poured
was
a
nice
dark
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
that
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
the
smellwas
nothing
special
a
slight
hint
of
honey
if
you
like
to
taste
beer
in
your
beer
this
is
not
for
you
it
is
very
sweet
with
an
overpowering
taste
of
honey
in
it
it
left
much
to
be
desired
god
bless
america
notes
nothing
special
just
a
slightly
sweet
lager
mouthfeel
was
good
the
bottle
has
beer
with
honey
printed
on
it
and
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
beer
tastes
really
good
with
parmesan
cheese
d
if
you
dont
mind
sugary
beers
youll
love
this
its
definitely
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
easily
drinkable
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
beer
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
it
is
not
one
that
i
would
drink
again
being
a
20year
honeymead
drinkerbrewer
i
have
some
experience
with
this
kind
of
beer
the
michelob
honey
lager
is
slightly
darker
gold
and
a
tiny
bit
thicker
than
a
standard
lager
which
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
the
honey
in
the
aroma
is
noticeable
but
not
as
overwhelming
as
some
suggest
nor
is
the
taste
dominated
by
the
honey
stored
within
sure
its
a
bit
sweet
but
also
kinda
malty
and
has
a
light
backtaste
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
fresh
corn
i
think
the
honey
flattens
the
head
but
its
a
small
price
to
pay
for
the
overall
taste
i
enjoy
it
bleh
not
good
im
glad
this
is
the
final
beer
from
the
6
pack
a
decent
lager
with
a
fruit
flavor
added
not
bad
but
the
honey
is
too
much
here
wheres
the
lager
part
d
3
0
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
in
a
cloying
overly
done
honey
fashion
but
almost
good
too
much
honey
without
substance
though
there
is
a
slight
touch
of
caramel
and
light
vague
hops
along
the
macro
line
not
bad
for
someone
who
wants
a
beer
with
a
heavy
hand
of
honey
and
not
much
else
honey
lingers
for
an
almost
annoyingly
long
time
this
is
a
pretty
low
score
from
me
but
i
just
dont
like
it
d
honey
lager
certainly
wont
knock
anyones
socks
off
theres
simply
not
enough
flavor
or
complexity
going
on
it
is
however
an
easy
drinking
beer
forgettable
at
best
but
a
passable
intro
to
the
uninitiated
dgoes
down
easy
but
how
many
beer
sugar
bombs
are
you
interested
in
i
dont
know
whether
the
target
consumers
drink
michelob
or
if
they
are
craft
beer
drinkers
looking
for
something
cheaper
than
their
usual
buys
whoever
they
are
michelob
probably
wont
get
them
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bronze
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
bready
malt
and
nothing
else
the
taste
is
of
bready
malt
too
more
than
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
honey
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
too
high
and
gets
in
the
way
of
tasting
the
beer
overall
this
beer
is
decent
at
best
and
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
again
used
to
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
stuff
on
the
cusp
of
my
microevolution
yet
another
single
picked
up
in
hampton
wow
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
a
really
bad
beer
but
this
one
fit
the
bill
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
a
glow
almost
not
much
of
a
head
a
little
sticky
lacing
sweet
very
sweet
with
a
strong
honey
flavor
its
almost
like
they
just
took
some
raw
honey
and
stirred
it
in
to
sweeten
the
beer
the
problem
is
that
theres
nothing
to
balance
the
sweetness
hops
are
virtually
nonexistent
real
hard
to
get
through
a
bottle
of
this
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
goldamber
color
with
lots
of
visible
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
one
finger
thick
bright
white
and
retained
ok
as
a
skim
but
laced
very
well
the
aroma
was
very
much
of
macro
mashedgrain
and
a
little
artificial
sweetness
the
flavors
were
similar
basic
michelob
beer
with
a
little
added
pale
malt
sweetness
and
something
syrupy
that
wanted
to
be
honey
but
wasnt
blah
bad
aftertaste
that
lingered
a
nail
in
the
coffin
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
the
carb
too
high
and
the
body
watery
thumbs
down
it
has
a
fizzy
gold
body
leading
to
an
offwhite
head
the
head
wasnt
that
impressive
but
the
lace
was
nice
it
has
a
twotone
body
it
gets
darker
towards
the
top
once
things
start
to
settle
it
smells
mainly
sweet
a
little
bit
of
honey
but
mostly
adjunct
and
malt
the
taste
is
also
somewhat
adjunct
as
well
but
not
bad
overall
the
after
taste
is
really
sweet
and
honey
like
there
is
a
little
bitterness
and
it
is
a
light
bodied
beer
taste
is
way
sweet
almost
cloying
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
good
on
this
one
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
if
you
want
a
sweet
brew
stick
with
a
wee
heavy
or
possibly
a
dopplebock
this
light
lagers
infused
with
flavors
are
horrible
im
willing
to
give
anheuserbusch
props
when
they
deserve
them
michelob
honey
lager
is
deserving
of
nothing
but
scorn
even
though
it
doesnt
taste
like
them
this
is
beer
for
those
who
think
that
fruity
pebbles
are
the
ultimate
in
breakfast
cereal
two
thumbs
waaay
down
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beginning
beer
for
any
bmc
drinker
looking
to
step
it
up
a
notch
bottle
pours
golden
and
clear
with
less
than
a
one
finger
head
it
had
some
decent
lacing
and
head
retention
the
aroma
was
sugaryhoney
sweet
with
possibly
some
corn
the
taste
was
sickly
sweet
from
first
sip
to
finish
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
smooth
but
not
very
easy
to
drink
did
not
detect
any
hops
at
alla
good
dose
of
them
may
have
helped
out
a
bit
here
i
thought
that
honey
might
mike
this
beer
a
little
more
enjoyable
in
reality
it
just
adds
an
off
anrtificial
flavor
to
an
already
bad
experience
the
same
yellow
color
and
no
head
the
nose
and
taste
are
all
stale
rice
watery
body
does
not
drink
well
at
all
overall
macro
with
honey
d
pretty
drinkable
if
it
was
less
sweet
maybe
a
bit
more
drinkable
drinkablity
a
lighter
beer
that
has
a
good
sweet
backbone
refreshing
and
satisfying
this
is
a
good
summertime
beer
and
i
think
its
underrated
being
that
its
an
ab
product
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
a
definite
sweet
honey
taste
it
is
lightbodied
with
honey
corn
and
a
grainy
malty
mix
its
not
bad
for
a
michelob
and
somewhat
refreshing
and
clean
still
this
is
not
a
whole
lot
better
than
standard
swill
blast
from
the
past
i
came
across
this
on
tap
last
weekend
up
in
cleveland
and
had
to
order
one
since
i
havent
come
across
it
in
years
i
used
to
work
in
a
beer
truck
at
an
outdoor
concert
center
and
this
was
on
tap
along
with
regular
michelob
it
was
decent
back
in
the
day
and
is
still
alright
in
my
book
faint
aroma
with
a
sweet
honey
scent
pour
is
soso
lack
of
a
decent
head
and
lacing
knock
it
below
average
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
thin
flavor
is
quenching
with
the
basic
michelobbud
grainy
malt
but
with
a
good
touch
of
sweet
honey
drinkability
this
thing
is
nasty
im
open
minded
and
thoguht
it
would
be
good
stuff
watery
light
has
a
wiered
after
taste
that
after
drinkking
half
of
it
i
feel
like
pouring
it
out
drinkability
not
a
terrible
ride
for
the
one
bottle
though
id
be
pretty
loathe
to
accept
an
entire
sixpack
d
drainpour
i
wouldnt
touch
this
one
again
pours
a
clear
amber
with
rocky
white
head
retention
is
ok
but
lacing
is
more
or
less
absent
smell
michelob
honey
honey

slight
presence
of
pale

and
boiled
hop
taste
astringent
grain
eurolager
skunk
character
finishes
with
honey
sweetness
that
overwhelms
a
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
very
thin
but
sticky
sweet
too
onesidedly
sweet
and
a
bit
watery
not
interested
in
another
d
poor
this
is
really
a
mess
d
this
is
not
a
bad
macro
lager
i
purchased
it
alot
in
college
because
my
girlfriend
would
actually
drink
it
but
i
picked
some
up
recently
and
it
is
still
a
good
session
beer
michelob
honey
lager
pours
a
typical
lager
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
i
dont
mind
the
aroma
sweet
honey
like
i
guess
very
fizzy
and
very
sweet
if
there
are
hops
in
this
i
dont
taste
them
not
the
worst
macro
ive
had
i
could
probably
drink
a
couple
sample
at
alefest
dayton
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
with
poor
retention
spotty
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
honey
and
a
hint
of
malt
lightbodied
with
a
flavor
differentiated
from
the
normal
michelob
only
by
the
added
honey
it
actually
seems
more
like
an
afterthought
than
a
concerted
effort
at
creating
something
new
the
finish
is
bland
and
mildly
sweet
not
worth
coming
back
to
the
sweetness
without
a
balance
would
do
me
in
after
two
but
as
a
single
shot
its
alright
especially
for
a
hot
day
low
drinkability
i
dont
even
think
im
going
to
bother
to
finish
this
bottle
life
is
too
short
this
beer
pours
a
light
honeyish
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
aroma
was
strong
on
the
honey
flavors
along
with
some
pale
malt
taste
follows
aroma
really
sweet
with
honey
being
prevalent
i
like
that
flavor
better
than
corn
or
rice
which
is
what
one
usually
finds
with
macros
but
its
still
nothing
special
lacks
complexity
and
balance
cloying
after
a
few
sips
very
similar
to
dundees
honey
offering
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
i
dont
think
im
going
to
pay
for
another
michelob
makes
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
per
bottle
and
scale
or
production
this
beer
was
ok
it
had
a
very
golden
color
and
on
the
pour
had
a
bubbly
head
which
went
away
as
fast
as
i
poured
it
aroma
was
typical
of
a
macro
lager
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
aroma
tasted
like
a
lager
with
honey
in
it
overall
this
was
an
ok
beer
that
i
would
not
buy
on
its
own
but
you
cant
say
you
dont
like
it
without
trying
it
nice
slightly
orangeyellowgold
color
very
clear
decent
head
aroma
is
fairly
clean
plain
nondescript
it
has
maybe
a
hint
of
a
honey
character
sort
of
like
a
lightly
floral
scent
but
just
barely
not
impressive
but
not
offensive
either
the
flavor
is
not
bad
at
all
if
this
is
an
american
macro
lager
ala
regular
michelob
its
got
it
beat
hands
down
much
more
malt
character
and
also
some
honey
sweetness
that
is
a
tad
cloying
but
not
too
much
certainly
not
more
than
a
lot
of
big
beers
and
big
beer
styles
and
does
have
some
balancing
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
although
its
clearly
on
the
malt
side
of
the
balance
i
think
this
beer
probably
had
honey
added
after
pasteurization
or
filtering
most
honey
beers
get
honey
sweetness
attenuated
by
the
yeast
or
certainly
the
homebrews
ive
made
and
consumed
have
been
so
maybe
its
kind
of
cheating
but
hey
i
think
it
works
ok
this
is
another
sample
from
the
holiday
pack
which
i
think
overall
is
pretty
good
for
a
macro
brewery
if
theyd
dump
the
mich
regular
and
use
that
allmalt
michelob
from
a
few
years
back
it
would
be
a
much
better
package
to
me
enters
the
mouth
soft
and
zesty
but
with
almost
no
honey
noticeable
as
i
would
have
expected
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
silk
on
the
mouthfeel
twords
the
end
of
the
palate
overall
drinkable
with
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
not
interesting
at
all
as
with
most
beers
fermented
with
honey
you
dont
really
get
a
honey
flavor
but
instead
you
encounter
a
light
fruity
malt
flavor
and
while
most
beers
fermented
with
honey
have
this
pleasant
quality
as
this
one
does
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
much
else
going
on
to
make
it
all
that
interesting
not
really
recommended
michelob

in
the

somewhat
surprising
in
fact
with

necessarily
a
good
one
either
a
solid
attempt
perhaps
and
ill
bet
something
that
my
nonbeer
geek
friends
would
call
good
drinkability
the
artificial
sweetness
is
only
detrimental
to
this
beer
it
doesnt
taste
like
honey
but
almost
like
someone
threw
an
equal
packet
into
michelob
lager
i
wanted
to
like
this
i
really
did
but
i
cant
i
just
cant
overall
unimpressive
to
the
point
of
being
almost
bad
nice
clean
head
easy
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
for
hot
wings
or
any
other
of
your
favorite
spicey
foods
i
found
this
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
enjoyed
in
a
long
time
its
totally
bitchin
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
beer
all
the
time
i
love
honey
beer
to
finish
this
review
and
try
to
be
fair
i
finished
the
beer
but
really
wanted
to
just
dump
it
out
ill
probably
throw
out
the
one
i
have
left
rather
than
suffer
through
another
one
light
bodied
mild
honey
flavored
brew
smooth
enough
slightly
sweet
but
balanced
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
finish
sampled
at
local
beer
store
poured
a
moderate
amber
color
with
white
head
smeel
is
sweetish
with
hints
of
honey
taste
is
good
at
first
but
the
sweetness
becomes
too
much
after
after
several
sips
left
a
sticky
feeling
in
the
mouth
glad
it
was
a
sample
overall
impression
no
off
flavors
and
the
honey
does
add
a
nice
touch
but
this
was
too
sweet
for
me
pours
a
transparent
bronze
color
with
an
airy
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
honey
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
almost
too
much
like
some
sort
of
artificial
honey
syrup
flavoring
there
is
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
first
taste
which
adds
a
little
kick
to
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
flat
it
almost
has
a
syrupy
feel
to
it
its
desperate
for
more
carbonation
after
a
couple
of
these
the
slimey
uncarbonated
mouthfeel
becomes
very
unattractive
this
was
a
suprise
i
was
expecting
much
much
sweeter
this
beer
was
about
right
as
far
as
the
sweetness
meter
goes
other
than
that
it
did
have
a
pretty
good
flavor
but
the
sweetness
was
definetly
the
centerpiece
overall
looked
normal
smelt
sweet
tasted
slightly
sweet
finished
with
a
honyesk
aftertaste
michelobs
honey
lager
delivers
a
clear
deep
golden
body
capped
by
an
averagesized
head
of
white
foam
that
drops
shortly
but
maintains
a
thin
surface
covering
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
before
it
goes
the
nose
is
welcoming
with
a
disctinctly
sweet
honey
flavor
and
some
malt
theres
no
hop
presence
to
speak
of
but
thats
to
be
expected
for
the
style
surprisingly
dextrinous
in
the
mouth
its
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
delicate
carbonation
that
gently
bristles
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
honeyish
as
well
but
its
not
overdone
and
theres
enough
bitterness
there
to
pull
it
into
a
drying
finish
and
keep
it
from
becoming
cloying
well
done
i
approached
this
one
with
mixed
feelings
ive
liked
some
of
the
new
michelob
brews
but
most
honey
flavored
beers
seem
to
fall
short
in
many
aspects
this
brew
is
decidedly
in
the
latter
camp
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
unappealing
head
the
aroma
is
faint
grain
and
a
little
honeymaybe
a
bit
of
a
cooked
corn
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
almost
unbearably
sweet
syrupy
and
cloying
now
i
enjoy
a
sweet
mead
occasionally
but
this
didnt
have
the
deep
honey
flavor
of
a
mead
instead
its
a
sugary
unbearable
sticky
sweetness
this
beer
was
not
for
me
at
all
in
my
opinion
this
is
worth
a
try
at
least
and
is
fairly
underrated
i
think
that
just
because
ab
puts
it
out
people
are
biased
against
it
but
it
is
really
a
decent
beer
and
is
worth
a
try
definitely
one
of
abs
best
well
what
can
i
say
its
beer
and
honey
flavored
water
slight
head
but
not
worth
speaking
of
this
one
is
made
to
be
drunk
from
the
bottle
all
in
all
what
you
would
expect
from
michelob
low
quality
beer
at
a
very
affordable
price
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
it
has
almost
no
flavor
but
without
the
perks
of
flavorless
light
beers
as
it
is
loaded
with
carbs
not
offensive
but
not
worth
touching
almost
horrible
too
much
like
sugar
water
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
too
many
of
these
feels
like
im
rotting
my
teeth
tasted
121904
overall
a
horrible
beer
i
think
it
is
physically
impossible
for
me
to
finish
a
sixer
in
a
night
if
i
tried
way
to
sweet
with
no
other
flavor
this
is
fairly
onedimensional
mundane
stuff
so
far
i
dont
think
ive
found
a
honey
beer
that
i
really
liked
appearance
is
honey
golden
head
is
below
averagesized
smell
has
a
generic
sweet
smell
mainly
malts
with
a
touch
of
honey
taste
is
sweet
honey
and
some
malts
not
too
strong
but
very
onedimensional
this
gets
old
fairly
quick
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
but
could
be
a
lot
better
if
this
had
a
little
more
character
not
something
ill
pick
up
again
reflection
this
is
another
good
example
why
i
dont
buy
anything
from
a
b
cheers
ill
finish
the
other
5
bottles
in
a
frozen
mug
to
deaden
my
taste
buds
wont
be
coming
back
to
this
the
beer
pours
a
very
transluscent
golden
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
sticks
around
longer
than
most
others
from
the
macro
companies
the
beer
smells
honey
sweet
without
much
more
coming
through
most
of
the
flavor
also
comes
from
the
honey
its
just
a
little
too
much
in
the
foreground
for
my
liking
the
beer
is
moderately
thick
in
my
mouth
rather
surprising
from
for
a
maro
offering
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
because
its
so
sweet
i
couldnt
do
more
than
a
few
not
a
bad
offerng
but
still
a
macro
beer
drinkability
i
gotta
be
in
a
mood
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
im
going
to
against
everything
i
have
ever
said
about
michelob
i
hate
michelob
but
i
figured
i
try
out
their
honey
lager
because
im
a
huge
fan
of
honey
beers
wines
and
all
most
anything
with
honey
it
i
wasnt
expecting
all
that
much
and
here
it
turned
out
to
be
probably
one
of
my
favorite
honey
beers
i
feel
that
it
puts
honey
brown
to
shame
and
i
love
honey
brown
this
beer
has
a
decent
golden
color
to
it
aroma
is
mild
with
the
sent
of
honey
floating
about
it
you
can
expect
the
average
north
american
lager
taste
that
you
get
from
most
big
name
brews
kind
of
plain
not
much
malt
flavor
or
much
hops
nothing
to
great
but
they
but
in
the
right
amount
of
honey
to
make
it
good
as
for
its
head
it
really
isnt
there
at
all
but
at
this
point
i
dont
care
i
feel
that
this
beer
was
well
done
drinkability
cant
drink
too
many
of
these
because
they
are
so
sweet
ok
for
about
one
or
two
but
that
is
it
looks
better
than
it
is
just
too
sweet
to
be
palatable
i
couldnt
even
finish
one
i
dont
think
all
that
sweetness
can
just
be
from
honey
unless
it
wasnt
alowed
to
completely
ferment
appearance
honey
golden
amber
tone
with
a
decent
sized
silky
white
head
leaves
behind
some
scanty
lacing
aroma
label
claims
all
malt
this
maybe
but
its
a
mild
biscuit
malt
sweetness
blended
with
honey
sweetness
this
ones
not
bad
some
very
light
hopping
taste
its
not
off
to
me
just
honey
trace
throught
it
with
some
light
bready
malt
sweetness
finishing
hops
to
balance
not
horrible
mouthfeel
lighter
bodied
not
too
impressed
with
this
aspect
and
quite
overcarbonated
drinkability
well
not
a
staple
but
the
best
of
the
michelob
sampler
in
my
opinion
refreshing
and
strangely
not
bad
from
a
sampler
box
i
bought
mostly
for
the
two
included
glasses
and
to
pacify
the
manager
of
a
local
beer
store
that
is
trying
to
get
her
distributor
to
find
something
more
exotic
than
heineken
and
sam
adams
pours
a
clear
golden
amber

disappears
in
seconds
nose
is
honey

maybe
a
faint
hint
of
malts
and
hops
mouthfeel

slightly
carbonated
taste
is
sweet
honeynot
much
else
no
lacing
is
evident
as
the
glass
empties
not
much
here
to
balance
the
honey
sweetness
syrupy
aftertaste
doesnt
improve
my
opinion
of
this
mediocre
offering
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
lager
characteristics
but
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
from
the
addition
of
honey
it
makes
the
aroma
a
little
more
complex
enjoyable
the
taste
is
good
it
has
the
flavor
of
a
macrolager
but
the
honey
mellows
it
out
and
adds
a
nice
sweet
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
average
amount
of
carbonation
it
drinks
well
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
money
macro
or
not
drinkability
a
noble
effort
but
not
sure
what
style
this
is
a
disappointing
part
of
the
sampler
pack
pours
a
bright
looking
gold
color
that
is
where
the
positives
end
sweet
and
funky
tasting
that
made
me
hold
back
my
gag
reflex
i
guess
honey
is
not
supposed
to
be
in
beer
see
leinies
honeyweiss
drinking
this
beer
was
not
a
very
pleasant
experience
i
cannot
recommend
anyone
buying
this
beer
for
anything
except
practical
jokes
poured
a
golden
amber
with
no
head
went
straight
to
lace
smell
has
some
pale
malts
behind
it
maybe
a
little
citrus
there
either
way
its
hard
to
get
a
good
whiff
of
this
beer
the
taste
isnt
too
bad
but
not
exciting
weird
honeylike
flavor
at
the
beginning
and
a
light
malt
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
interesting
very
effervescent
despite
the
lack
of
head
tingles
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
decent
drinkability
but
i
dunno
about
2
in
a
row
too
bland
yikes
an
a
b
beer
that
is
drinkable
just
it
does
look
a
little
like
apple
juice
and
it
definitely
contains
a
honey
sweetness
but
hey
on
a
hot
day
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
the
fridge
the
taste
is
acceptably
good
the
initial
beer
taste
is
subsumed
in
the
sweetness
which
is
not
overwhelming
in
fact
there
are
bitter
elements
that
linger
a
lot
of
times
when
i
have
an
particularly
bad
or
too
bitter
beer
to
dispose
of
i
will
please
no
one
panic
mix
some
honey
lager
in
and
end
up
with
something
a
lot
more
palatable
or
to
produce
the
result
i
am
looking
for
but
cant
find
in
one
beer
try
my
recipe
1
part
bass
ale
1
part

lager
2
parts
samuel
adams
boston
lager
perfection
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
sweet
as
expected
with
honey
nothing
much
else
in
the
nose
the
flavor
was
not
one
of
my
favorites
it
was
sweet
but
very
bitter
at
the
same
time
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
poured
a
glowing
golden
and
by
glowing
i
mean
it
had
an
odd
chemical
reaction
brightness
or
at
least
it
struck
me
that
way
nice
tight
fluffy
head
lightly
sweet
malt
aroma
initial
taste
was
a
sweetness
with
bittersweetness
floating
on
top
dried
at
the
finish
with
a
powdery
mouthfeel
but
then
crept
back
with
an
odd
oily
slickness
as
the
beer
warmed
an
artificial
sweetener
aspect
became
pronounced
as
did
the
oily
finish
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
but
little
of
it
enjoyable
alright
this
has
got
to
be
the
most
peculiar
beer
i
have
ever
had
ever
it
pours
a
nice
darker
golden
colour
almost
like
apple
juice
and
the
smell
is
quite
nice
too
the
taste
is
actually
quite
good
when
it
first
gets
into
your
mouth
it
immediately
tastes
of
beer
which
it
should
but
quickly
it
turns
sweet
quite
sweet
in
fact
and
one
can
most
definately
tell
that
honey
was
indeed
involved
in
the
production
of
this
brew
i
saw
where
one
fellow
wrote
in
his
review
that
this
stuff
leaves
a
peculiar
but
pleasant
after
taste
in
ones
mouth
and
i
must
say
id
have
to
agree
with
that
i
really
like
this
brew
even
though
it
is
quite
strange
sweeter
than
most
people
seem
to
enjoy
i
gave
it
3
0
because
of
its
sweetness
in
drinkability
and
as
much
as
i
hate
to
say
it
it
comes
from
anheuserbusch
tis
a
day
of
great
shame
for
i
have
spoken
praise
to
ab
bright
deep
gold
color
creamy
short
term
head
that
quickly
becomes
large
bubbles
and
then
fades
smells
of
apple
and
adjunct
i
cant
detect
any
honey
in
the
nose
first
impression
is
of
one
dimensional
sweetness
no
bitterness
but
is
lightly
sharp
from
the
carbonation
not
much
to
taste
except
the
sweetness
quite
a
disgusting
beer
i
must
admit
that
i
threw
it
out
tastes
like
a
macro
with
a
tablespoon
of
sugar
added
this
brew
pours
a
nice
white
head
of
small
bubbles
and
leaves
behind
a
nice
lacing
as
it
recedes
it
has
an
aroma
of
honey
and
some
malt
i
rather
like
the
taste
of
this
brew
for
the
money
it
has
a
nice
honey
malty
flavor
and
is
very
smooth
there
is
a
mild
aftertaste
that
leaves
a
nice
flavor
in
your
mouth
all
in
all
it
is
a
good
allround
drinking
beer
i
just
wish
i
could
get
it
more
when
i
go
out
tasted
faily
sweet
but
not
too
bad
it
even
had
an
after
taste
of
banannas
which
i
found
really
interesting
im
not
saying
we
should
call
this
a
bananaweisen
but
for
a
hot
afternoon
grilling
it
was
good
taste
is
slick
and
sweet
for
sure
lots
of
honey
flavors
front
and
back
famialer
ab
cornwater
taste
as
well
no
hops
at
all
none
a
touch
more
pleasing
than
i
anticipated
though
slick
sweet
finish
nearly
syrupy
not
to
be
guzzled
but
it
did
okay
against
bud
budlight
and
miller
lite
on
tap
pours
typical
yellow
decent
carbonation
only
a
slight
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
inviting
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
so
you
get
the
honey
taste
pretty
strong
so
any
malt
is
hidden
hops
are
decent
finishes
with
a
sweet
honey
aftertaste
i
dont
like
honey
brews
and
this
hasnt
changed
my
opinion
leftover
from
the
ales
and
lagers
winter
12
pack
pours
a
straw
color
with
thin
carbonation
the
thin
head
disseminates
rapidly
very
faint
honey
and
grainy
smell
the
honey
taste
stays
throughout
with
somewhat
of
a
bad
syrup
feel
left
on
the
palate
the
idea
is
right
a
decent
balance
of
the
honey
but
a
bit
tough
to
drink
however
might
be
one
of
the
better
michelob
brews
still
i
dont
know
why
i
try
all
these
odd
flavored
beers
this
pours
a
dark
gold
with
a
fast
fading
head
which
turns
to
a
lace
the
aroma
of
honey
is
there
not
much
of
anything
else
the
taste
has
a
bit
malt
but
is
over
ran
with
honey
a
bit
too
much
for
me
i
would
like
a
slight
hint
of
it
not
bad
but
nothing
that
i
would
drink
again
pour
this
hard
and
you
get
a
get
head
there
isnt
a
lot
of
carbonation
leaves
a
lace
pale
orange
color
and
a
faint
honey
nose
very
light
bodied
but
better
than
a
mic
lager
very
definite
taste
of
honey
and
finishes
with
smooth
malthoney
flavor
the
abv
is
4
9
this
is
an
alright
brew
for
the
style
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
slight
reddish
hue
and
a
creamy
head
that
thins
to
short
layer
it
smells
like
honey
with
a
light
hoppy
aroma
the
one
thing
i
do
not
much
care
for
is
how
sweet
it
is
i
know
that
honey
be
is
supposed
to
be
sweet
but
this
is
just
a
little
too
much
for
my
tastes
it
has
some
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
but
still
goes
down
fairly
smooth
this
is
just
an
average
beer
for
this
style
deep
amber
colored
body
is
topped
by
a
rather
thick
white
head
this
beer
displays
excellent
head
retention
for
an
american
macro
the
aroma
is
strong
on
honey
with
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
again
pleasing
especially
from
ab
the
taste
of
honey
hits
you
inmmediately
upon
the
first
sip
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
blueberry
honey
taste
different
but
good
nice
malt
background
with
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
honey
sweetness
is
not
balanced
all
that
well
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
a
little
thick
leaving
a
thin
syrupy
cating
on
the
tongue
residual
sweetness
lags
behind
again
betraying
the
unbalanced
honey
and
perhaps
a
lack
of
bittering
hops
drinakbility
is
hurt
by
the
cloying
sweetness
the
honey
creates
a
decent
beer
from
ab
but
an
overly
liberal
use
waste
of
honey
this
is
a
good
beer
as
far
as
mainstream
honey
beers
go
i
enjoy
this
one
and
its
sweetness
its
sweet
yet
dark
so
the
combonation
is
a
good
one
it
had
a
nice
dark
color
to
it
with
a
short
lived
light
brown
head
had
a
very
strong
honey
taste
at
first
and
finnished
with
it
i
could
see
it
getting
too
sweet
for
some
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
finnishes
smooth
and
delivers
satisfaction
a
nice
sweet
change
of
pace
on
occasion
and
my
favorite
out
of
the
sampler
if
you
like
sweet
beers
give
it
a
shot
you
might
like
it
if
not
stay
away
because
it
is
overdone
kind
of
like
a
sweet
can
of
fruit
punch
or
something
like
that
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
with
a
twist
off
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
drinkability
could
be
an
issue
as
the
sweetness
here
could
catch
up
with
desire
to
quaff
this
particular
product
in
abundance
pours
an
ultra
clear
goldenorange
with
a
tiny
i
mean
tiny
white
head
that
all
but
completely
disappeared
the
smell
is
a
very
faint
fresh
bread
smell
that
is
lightly
sweet
the
taste
of
honey
is
very
very
apparent
in
this
beer
almost
overwhelmingly
so
whew
this
thing
is
sweet
tasting
with
a
carb
bite
and
nothing
else
can
get
past
the
honey
strange
tasting
at
best
for
a
company
thats
normally
scared
to
use
flavor
they
went
flipside
on
the
honey
here
they
just
dont
understand
if
you
have
bold
flavor
you
have
to
provide
some
type
of
complexity
to
it
to
counter
balance
things
very
light
bodied
and
oh
so
sweet
not
in
a
good
way
not
very
drinkable
at
all
in
fact
i
struggled
through
12
ounces
of
this
stuff
cheers
i
also
was
surprised
by
thisone
for
i
have
not
found
a
honey
ive
liked
yet
until
now
my
rate
s
are
up
for
that
reason
a
pure
gold
clear
honey
color
with
a
white
puff
shortlived
head
somewhat
medium
lace
aroma
is
kinda
grainy
beerlike
rather
than
honey
on
the
nose
very
ab
smooth
mouthfeel
leaves
the
mouth
alittle
dry
taste
is
more
of
a
caramel
sweet
than
an
overdone
honey
sweet
beleave
it
or
not
this
is
my
best
honey
and
perhaps
my
pick
of
ab
specialties
pours
to
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
there
is
a
faint
sweet
malt
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
a
very
pronounced
honey
flavor
it
finshes
smooth
and
sweet
with
low
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surpised
with
this
one
the
honey
flavor
really
came
through
on
this
one
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
would
be
a
drinkable
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
rich
medium
amber
rich
head
and
tentatively
clingy
lace
not
bad
apperaance
in
a
glass
poured
from
tap
very
sweet
malt
and
under
carbonated
way
to
sweet
to
drink
at
all
make
me
sick
to
my
stomach
it
is
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
very
strong
taste
of
natural
honey
much
more
than
i
had
expected
the
honey
is
balanced
out
by
a
nice
maltiness
that
makes
it
an
all
around
flavorable
beer
anyway
i
didnt
think
this
was
too
bad
i
surely
dont
accept
it
as
a
serious
specialty
beer
but
i
think
its
kind
of
a
macro
novelty
that
you
try
once
and
leave
it
at
that
sorryhoney
lager
good
hustle
but
i
dont
think
you
made
the
team
after
a
hard
day
of
shopping
at
the
market
i
was
very
thirsty
when
i
popped
the
top
on
this
michelob
honey
lager
the
combination
of
the
sweet
honey
and
the
bite
of
the
hops
put
my
palate
at
ease
right
off
the
bat
this
is
a
fairly
good
macro
lager
any
beer
that
tastes
better
out
of
the
bottle
has
problems
i
was
dissatisfied
at
the
lack
of
head
and
head
retention
i
was
dejected
at
the
lack
of
smell
some
faint
sweetness
honey
but
nothing
noteworthy
the
taste
seemed
kind
of
manufactured
the
honeysweetness
did
not
seem
natural
i
did
not
find
the
flavors
overwhelming
nor
did
i
find
them
overly
enjoyable
i
could
drink
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
pinch
and
thats
about
all
i
think
the
ba
reviewers
were
on
to
something
the
brewers
were
full
of
crapthis
is
not
what
it
should
be
honey
when
added
into
the
fermentation
process
where
it
belongs
imo
will
not
sweeten
the
beer
honey
is
100
simple
sugar
thus
100
fermentable
i
cant
stand
it
when
brewers
and
meaderies
make
such
cloyingly
sweet
beverages
such
as
michelob
honey
lager
what
they
are
really
doing
is
flavoring
this
otherwise
decent
beer
with
honey
to
give
it
honeyish
aroma
and
sweetness
they
have
to
add
it
after
the
yeast
has
been
removed
or
killed
otherwise
it
would
ferment
out
and
you
would
get
a
drier
more
vinous
flavor
from
the
honey
and
maybe
the
aromatics
of
the
flowers
the
bees
were
using
dundee
ab
stop
doing
this
it
misrepresents
the
true
role
of
honey
in
fermented
beverages
i
damn
it
on
principle
cloying
and
sickeningly
sweet
j
w
dundees
does
a
better
job
with
their
honey
brown
this
smells
o
k
pours
out
to
a
bright
yellow
then
assaults
you
mouth
with
a
nasty
sweet
taste
that
follows
through
all
the
way
to
the
end
i
didnt
dislike
this
beer
and
even
drank
a
few
of
them
while
i
was
at
it
but
i
can
see
where
beer
geeks
would
be
turned
off
the
honey
taste
and
sweetness
was
almost
overwhelming
but
genuine
nothing
i
would
seek
out
if
i
had
to
pay
for
it
since
i
had
this
at
a
friends
house
if
you
really
like
the
sweet
taste
of
honey
or
are
looking
for
a
breakfast
beer
to
go
with
those
pancakes
this
is
a
good
choice
if
your
looking
for
genuine
beer
flavor
stear
clear
of
all
the
michelob
craft
brews
way
too
sweet
and
very
hard
to
drink
one
12
oz
bottle
needs
a
bigger
twang
of
hop
andor
a
bit
of
dryness
not
recommended

all

it
doesnt

just
doesnt
really
taste

a
little

for

i
had
this
beer
with
a
burger
and
it
was
not
a
bad
pairing

srsly
not
a
malt

overly
fizzy
slightly
sweet
light
beer
disguised
as
real
beer

stuffed
i
liked
it
it
was
cold
fresh
and
tasted
great
no
problems

it

one
last
thing
as
i
pour
whats
left
in
my
glass
down
the
drain
when
im
out
of
town
i
like
to
pick
up
a
new
beer
or
two
that
i
havent
seen
locally
that
would
be
the
reason
for
this
purchase
when
i
returned
to
my
home
in
missouri
i
looked
up
ziegenbock
on
the
web
it
apparently
has
had
a
very
colorful
life
one
point
i
thought
interesting
was
that
it
is
only
sold
in
texas
i
bought
my
sixer
on
a
fishing
trip
in
arkansas
and
must
say
that
regardless
of
where
its
sold
i
wont
be
buying
again
d
overall
approachable
and
foodfriendly
if
a
bit
one
or
twonote
and
lacking
in
complexity
btw
im
not
just
hating
on
inbev
for
the
sake
of
it
if
they
were
to
make
a
good
beer
i
would
rate
it
well
this
just
isnt
a
good
beer
tho
a
friend
of
mine
brought
me
back
a
little
mixpack
from
texas
he
doesnt
know
a
lot
about
craft
beers
but
the
sentiment
was
nice
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
muddled
clear
light
brown
coloring
with
a
thin
ring
of
offwhite
film
around
the
surface
aromas
are
subtle
with
a
blending
of
roast
and
sugary
caramel
sweetness
flavors
are
watery
at
best
with
a
touch
of
sweet
on
the
midtongue
and
really
nothing
else
i
mean
theres
a
dose
of
carbonation
to
sharpen
up
the
nothingness
wow
this
is
like
carbonated
water
theres
really
no
aftertaste
because
there
is
no
taste
taste
maybe
a
touch
of
caramel
but
that
is
really
reaching
carbonated
and
watery
in
mouth
the
finish
is
light
and
clean
because
there
really
isnt
anything
to
linger
behind
jesus
this
was
a
stretch
to
get
much
of
anything
out
of
this
one
drink
meh
at
least
it
was
free
never
again
though
very
drinkable
but
not
memorable
luckily
i
found
several
other
good
texas
beers
when
i
was
there
popping
the
top
on
this
brew
i
get
a
sweet
adjunct
smell
pours
to
a
light
root
beer
color
with
a
beige
head
that
fades
quickly
taste
is
rather
bland
a
sweet
and
sour
balance
that
is
overpowered
by
a
soda
like
carbonation
taste
is
consistent
throughout
and
then
the
finish
is
clean
with
no
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
and
when
the
fizz
goes
it
is
rather
watery
almost
more
lika
a
soda
than
a
beer
no
thanks
the
beer
pours
a
combination
of
dark
yellow
mixed
with
an
color
the
aroma
is
strange
it
has
cooked
sour
vegetables
with
a
mixture
of
grainy
malt
and
generic
sweetness
the
flavor
has
a
large
starchy
adjunct
component
i
am
not
sure
what
the
adjunct
is
here
but
it
is
definitely
present
in
a
big
way
there
is
a
dash
of
bitterness
at
then
end
o
overall
there
was
nothing
really
special
about
this
beer
and
it
is
not
one
i
would
recommend
if
you
want
a
pseudobock
beer
and
are
in
tx
i
would
recommend
shiner
over
this
o
would
never
seek
this
beer
again
rather
drink
shiner
bock
or
pbr
o
this
is
a
poor
example
of
a
bock
taste
like
your
typical
american
adjunct
lager
with
some
light
artificial
bock
flavorings
reviewed
on

light
mouthfeel
not
as
good
as
shiner
bock
in
my
opinion
i
will
not
have
it
again
o
if
theres
a
brew
out
there
thats
made
for
when
craft
beer
drinkers
want
to
sit
around
in
lush
mode
and
polish
off
a
twelve
pack
alone
this
ones
it
usually
the
same
price
and
availability
as
budweiser
but
with
a
thicker
feel
and
a
much
more
interesting
flavor
not
really
a
beer
to
brag
about
other
than
its
from
ab
and
is
one
of
their
better
beers
kinda
sad
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
if
there
is
nothing
else
around
medium
to
dark
clear
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
grain
and
lightly
toasted
malt
with
not
too
much
else
going
on
the
flavor
is
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
with
a
lot
of
grain
toasted
malt
and
some
grass
notes
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
offensive
but
a
relatively
flavorless
beer
with
no
real
exciting
qualities
it
lacks
in
flavor
but
its
highly
drinkable
brownish
copper
with
a
fluffy
tan
colored
head
the
smell
consists
of
sweet
corny
metallic
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
tastes
of
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
butter
and
toffee
it
has
a
light
medium
body
with
low
but
soft
carbonation
better
than
other
macro
lagers
but
still
nothing
to
brag
about
ziegenbock
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
light
head
formation
and
a
slightly
malty
nose
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
at
first
there
is
a
nutty
taste
shortly
thereafter
with
hints
of
caramel
the
beer
seems
to
have
a
sweet
finish
as
well
this
would
not
be
one
of
my
regular
go
tos
but
its
not
bad
either
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
on
tap
at
a
bar
but
i
dont
think
id
ever
buy
a
six
pack
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
ziegenbock
is
amberbrown
in
color
with
a
white
fizzy
head
the
nose
is
sweet
maltiness
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
taste
is
just
as
remarkable
as
the
smell
slightly
sweet
caramel
maltiness
but
thats
about
it
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
body
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
remarkable
either
like
most
i
thought
this
was
a
genuine
texas
beer
but
was
duped
by
a
b
i
would
definitely
go
with
shiner
over
this
but
it
is
a
better
alternative
to
the
standard
light
beer
o
i
was
fooled
into
believing
that
this
was
a
local
texas
beer
only
now
when
i
went
to
write
this
review
did
i
learn
that
it
was
brewed
by
ab
that
being
said
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
it
while
drinking
it
it
really
lacked
body
and
character
while
drinkable
it
was
nothing
special
rjt
until
i
got
ready
to
review
this
i
didnt
realize
it
was
a
anheuserbusch
flanker
against
shiner
sad
and
unfortunately
not
a
very
good
beer
ziegenbock
is
anheuserbuschs
answer
to
shiner
bock
i
assume
its
only
available
in
texas
and
theyve
undercut
the
price
on
shiner
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
bock
this
is
much
further
from
the
real
thing
than
a
shiner
if
youre
looking
for
a
refreshing
water
beer
this
is
better
than
shiner
and
most
water
beers
but
other
than
just
enough
hops
to
make
it
nice
and
crisp
there
is
no
flavour
aside
from
a
weird
annoying
aftertaste
the
best
point
about
this
beer
is
its
keg
price
it
competes
with
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
in
keg
prices
i
dont
know
how
keystone
might
be
the
only
keg
cheaper
than
this
if
youre
throwing
a
party
and
wondering
whether
to
get
bud
light
high
life
ziegenbock
or
anything
else
that
costs
under
90
its
an
easy
choice
get
this
it
may
not
be
impressive
but
it
totally
beats
piss
water
and
is
the
same
price
sadly
this
beer
is
only
made
in
houston
and
therefore
anything
outside
of
abs
houston
distribution
area
doesnt
have
this
choice
it
is
owned
by
ab
but
is
brewed
here
in
the
houston
area
overall
it
was
just
too
bland
for
me
nothing
really
going
on
with
it
could
be
worse
though
and
still
better
then
most
of
the
macro
stuff
you
see
good
cheap
beer
to
choose
at
a
bar
or
club
in
texas
on
the
whole
though
not
something
i
would
pick
up
at
a
store
to
drink
on
my
own
had
this
during
a
3hour
layover
in
the
dallasfort
worth
airport
on
my
way
to
cali
for
the
bruery
rs
party
was
told
it
was
a
local
brew
served
from
tap
into
a
mug
poured
redorange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
very
minimal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
was
of
sweet

it
had

on
the
palate
with
high

overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
at
all
not
much
going
on
here
as
it
was
weak
in
all
aspects
and
dare
i
say
watered
down
after
this
mug
full
i
started
pounding
double

cokes
until
my
flight
left
what
should
i
have
expected
i
was
in
an

afterall
overall
this
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
anheuserbush
in
a
red
lager
its
in
competition
to
the
shiner
bock
and
marketed
in
texas
hence
the
reason
they
taste
quite
similar
this
beer
however
smooth
it
is
lacks
a
real
flavor
as
some
other
beers
like
it
do
pretty
good
but
not
one
i
would
pick
again
on
my

there
was
not
much
to
this
beer
it
has
a
pretty
bland
taste
with
some
malt
flavors
it
was
thin
and
watery
it
wasnt
offensive
or
anything
easy
drinking
macro
it
went
just
fine
with
some

i
did

the

from

was
in
the
austin
airport
the
other
day
nicely
done
very
drinkable
in
flavor
balance
and
body
you
could
easily
have
quite
a
few
of
these
during
a
night
out
with
the
boys
if
you
were
just
interested
in
throwin
em
back
this
is
the
first
ziegenbock
ive
ever
had
as
far
as
i
know
it
might
be
a
tad
better
than
shiner
bock
thats
no
reason
to
ever
have
another
though
this
is
probably
abs
attempt
to
brew
a
beer
to
compete
with
texas
shiner
bock
neither
are
great
examples
but
this
one
is
just
a
watery
lager
that
had
a
longer
boil
compared
to
budweiser
this
is
dark
and
heavy
however
drink
at
your
own
risk
decent
deep
browngold
colour
with
a
small
bubbly
head
aroma
is
strongly
adjuncts
with
a
little
bit
of
unprocessed
malt

is
corn
and
very
mild
hops
adjuncty
aftertaste
not
a
good
one
thanks
still
grub
thanks
for
sample
grub
macro
brewery
however
this
is
underrated
in
that
it
is
more
than
a
passable
brew
light
colour
creamy
in
mouth
light
mouthfeel
aroma
a
bit
cheesy
negative
drinkable
some
bitterness
in
finish
not
really
a
bock
thanks
grub
for
something
new
and
different
drinkability
is
ok
not
as
bad
as
the
usual
offerings
from
ab
but
not
great
either
d
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
not
that
id
have
more
than
one
drinkability
easy
to
put
down
a
6
pack
i
assume
this
is
a
texas
only
beer
as
i
have
not
sen
it
before
only
heard
about
it
here
on
ba
obviously
aimed
at
shiner
bock
but
id
take
a
shiner
anyday
as
would
most
texans
i
suspect
brewed
by
ab
the
packaging
looks
like
something
from
michelobe
so
im
not
expecting
much
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
appearance
right
after
the
pour
an
amber
caramel
colored
body
with
a
thick
whitish
head
a
faint
smell
of
caramel
sweetness
barely
reaches
the
nose
the
body
is
very
thin
id
hate
to
taste
the
light
version
and
tastes
watered
down
sort
of
like
a
bud
with
some
caramel
flavoring
i
wouldnt
want
anymore
of
this
even
if
it
was
available
in
my
state
it
could
be
very
drinkable
if
only
i
liked
it
its
one
of
those
beers
that
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
due
to
its
light
body
and
carbonation
their
web
site
states
only
texans
get
it
well
they
can
have
it
these
are
a
step
below
shiner
bock
in
my
opinion
comments
go
get
a
shiner
bock
or
even
better
since
its
classified
as
an
american
amberred
ale
go
get
a
rogue
all
american
ale
or
a
fat
tire
ive
had
this
brew
before
but
forgot
how
much
i
disliked
it
if
i
had
known
in
advance
it
was
an
anheuserbusch
product
i
never
would
have
picked
it
up
anyway
yuk
and
double
yuk
no
balance
no
real
flavor
the
usual
ab
cornrice
filler
is
ever
present
carbonation
is
about
right
not
a
bock
at
all
just
amber
colored
i
guess
its
kinda
like
that
new
ultra
amber
junk
i
cant
imagine
how
brewers
put
out
product
like
this
and
expect
people
to
buy
it
of
course
its
like
a
buddy
of
mine
said
once
you
can
just
mix
any
crap
up
slap
some
sort
of
label
on
it
and
somebody
will
buy
it
guess
thats
right
the
sign
in
the
airport
bar
announced
only
texans
get
it
on
sampling
the
beer
i
had
to
wonder
why
they
would
particularly
want
it
pretty
easy
to
peg
in
the
amber
lager
category
so
i
was
let
down
that
i
wasnt
getting
a
bock
beer
they
should
at
least
be
honest
enough
to
call
it
ziegenamber
some
middleoftheroad
malt
flavor
a
bit
grainy
with
adjunct
notes
a
chocolate
note
in
the
malt
faltered
and
faded
before
making
any
impression
overall
ab
did
a
good
job
making
a
beer
that
i
dont
think
is
good
quite
drinkable
if
that
makes
much
sense
bottle
says
brewed
exclusively
for
texas
thats
fine
with
me
likely
the
best
ab
product
ive
had
pours
out
to
an
odd
caramel
brown
color
with
some
dark
gold
notes
a
big
head
of
white
foam
quickly
calms
to
about
14
of
an
inch
medium
to
medium
high
carbonation
and
little
lacing
aromas
of
buttery
yeast
and
malt
are
suprisingly
enjoyable
as
a
sweet
grain
element
rears
its
head
in
there
as
well
taste
is
mediumlight
bodied
but
still
fair
caramel
malts
and
roasted
notes
make
way
for
some
sweet
and
mild
hops
followed
by
the
everpresent
ab
wash
out
the
flavors
die
a
quick
death
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
a
step
above
others
as
there
is
some
density
and
crispness
to
the
beer
drinkability
is
north
of
average
ab
should
seriously
consider
marketing
this
outside
of
texas
becase
for
what
it
is
it
isnt
bad
worth
a
try
special
thanks
goes
out
to
assurbanipaul
for
the
sample
i
can
definetly
tell
this
is
an
ab
beer
because
it
tastes
watered
down
its
not
bad
and
it
tastes
smooth
im
surprised
that
this
has
so
much
praise
if
bud
light
is
an
avoid
ab
beers
a
lot
of
the
time
taste
watered
down
this
beer
is
smooth
for
a
bock
but
thats
not
a
good
thinkg
imo
it
doesnt
have
that
bitter
bite
that
i
expect
from
a
bock
beer
its
a
bock
beer
for
the
non
beer
drinker
this
beer
was
purchased
for
me
at
the
bar
by
an
anheuserbusch
representative
i
asked
about
redhook
but
no
dice
cheers2beers
when
you
go
to
hooters
you
dont
go
for
the
beer
i
like
their
sandwiches
and
the
hospitality
but
this
beer
is
an
abomination
i
will
just
hope
that
there
is
some
shiner
for
me
to
suffer
through
if
only
hooters
believed
in
optimator
i
had
this
one
on
tap
in
an
texas
airport
its
a
light
transparent
amber
color
with
a
respectable
white
head
the
nose
is
of
lightly
roasted
toasted
malt
its
not
a
strong
smell
but
its
attractive
and
is
vaguely
reminiscent
of
breadcrust
theres
a
little
caramel
in
the
taste
which
is
teasingly
malty
finish
has
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
i
certainly
wouldnt
use
the
word
bock
on
this
beer
its
a
fairly
thin
and
uninspiring
brew
still
theres
nothing
particularly
wrong
with
it
satisfying
but
average
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
in
to
nothing
no
lacing
either
not
too
much
stands
out
in
the
smell
i
was
hoping
for
something
slightly
hoppy
but
to
no
avail
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
redeeming
qualities
of
the
beer
but
otherwise
i
would
choose
something
different
in
the
future
enjoyed
at
dfw
airport
starts
even
smooth
and
slightly
bitter
settles
fullbodied
and
semisweet
with
caramel
cashew
and
wheat
flavors
finishes
smooth
but
heavy
and
very
strong
leaves
a
lasting
wheatlike
aftertase
with
sweetened
edges
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
flourish
of
an
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
just
a
whisp
on
top
sweet
almost
cloying
aroma
of
adjunct
malt
and
the
faintest
hint
of
cheap
hops
accented
by
a
touch
of
caramel
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
i
guess
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
i
dont
see
why
you
would
want
to
not
a
bad
beer
to
pour
on
the
roasting
pig
ziegenpig
but
not
a
session
beer
even
for
a
pig
over
hot
mesquite
coals
when
i
purchased
this
today
in
orange
texas
i
though
this
was
a
shiner
bock
amber
version
i
know
realize
it
said
zeigenbock
not
bad
for
an
amber
the
label
says
its
brewed
and
available
only
in
texas
but
its
a
anheuser
busch
beer
oh
well
nothing
too
exciting
for
an
amber
but
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
this
arrives
with
a
nice
thick
offwhite
head
above
a
deep
mahogany
color
there
was
not
much
evident
on
the
nose
maybe
a
light
maltiness
but
nothing
to
really
speak
of
it
has
a
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
but
not
a
lot
of
taste
the
finish
is
light
and
sweet
but
again
there
is
just
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
evident
this
was
all
very
disappointing
for
something
that
they
are
calling
a
bock
regardless
of
style
even
as
a
lager
i
would
expect
to
taste
something
oh
well
note
unless
texas
dictates
otherwise
i
have
to
believe
the
abv
on
this
is
beter
than
4
and
in
line
with
the
michelob
products
comments
brewed
and
available
only
in
texas
thank
goodness
at
least
maybe
the
rest
of
the
world
will
not
be
subject
to
this
beer
when
seeking
a
texasmade
bock
grab
a
shiner
overall
the
taste
is
unimpressive
it
has
a
bready
malt
taste
that
lasts
all
the
way
through
to
the
aftertaste
no
hops
to
speak
of
in
the
mouth
it
feels
way
too
carbonated
and
has
a
very
thin
body
the
closest
thing
i
can
compare
it
to
is
soda
without
the
syrupy
texture
this
seems
to
be
a
darker
colored
version
of
bud
with
a
bit
more
taste
than
bud
though
not
much
as
the
label
states
brewed
and
available
only
in
texas
i
believe
it
goes
by
michelob
amber
elsewhere
if
not
they
taste
about
the
same
a
large
brewerys
attempt
at
competing
with
a
smaller
local
favorite
shiner
drinkability
an
easy
session
beer
with
a
bit
of
character
why
is
it
only
available
in
texas
though
this
would
sell
well
farther
north
bring
it
up
parting
thoughts
a
good
beer
from
busch
while
not
exceptional
its
easy
to
find
and
enjoyable
this
beer
is
a
light
amber
color
with
a
medium
thin
offwhite
head
that
disappeared
quickly
thin
and
quick
lacing
the
aroma
is
faint
sweet
malt
kind
of
thin
with
a
light
hops
and
honeynutty
flavor
the
finish
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hops
bitterness
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
it
just
doesnt
pack
much
punch
overall
impression
this
is
an
excellent
wellrounded
bock
that
someone
has
poured
into
a
gallon
of
water
what
is
there
is
good
but
far
too
watered
down
to
be
enjoyable
the
bock
name
must
be
from
the
same
texas
alcohol
laws
that
make
shiner
call
itself
bock
but
neither
of
these
beers
are
a
true
bock
drinkability
is
equivalent
to
water
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
that
but
not
going
to
scratch
any
beer
itch
you
may
have
i
guess
i
could
recommend
this
beer
if
you
are
very
thirsty
but
dont
want
a
beer
i
found
this
bottle
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
with
a
born
on
date
of
10
sept
2002
this
beer
poured
a
medium
brown
with
very
bright
clarity
the
head
was
white
and
in
good
contrast
to
the
dark
brown
liquid
too
bad
it
went
away
so
fast
the
aroma
maybe
had
a
hint
of
roasted
the
taste
was
of
malt
with
a
little
sweetness
the
hops
were
not
present
in
either
the
taste
or
the
aroma
or
maybe
this
beer
is
so
well
balanced
i
could
not
detect
them
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
had
no
creaminess
not
a
bad
beer
to
sip
at
a
bar
or
in
the
backyard
over
a
burger
or
a
dog
the
label
says
it
is
brewed
and
available
only
in
texas
i
sought
out
this
brew
after
seeing
it
on
the
ab
website
and
many
thanks
to
fellow
ba
txhops
for
allowing
an
ohion
to
aquire
this
texas
only
brew
i
have
to
say
its
like
it
national
sister
amberbock
in
ways
although
alittle
darker
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
foam
soft
white
head
lace
was
hard
to
come
by
taste
is
more
malt
very
little
hop
the
mouth
starts
out
carbonated
fizzlike
but
the
mouth
is
left
dry
a
very
drinkable
smooth
brew
that
goes
well
with
burgers
cookout
type
fair
even
if
this
is
a
once
in
a
lifetime
for
me
im
very
pleased
i
tried
it
pours
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
into
a
nice
lace
nose
is
fresh
malts
and
grains
taste
is
rather
bland
this
beer
is
similar
to
shiner
bock
but
is
a
step
down
in
my
opinion
still
if
you
find
yourself
in
texas
its
worth
a
try
on
tap
on
a
recent
layover
in
dallas
deep
dark
brown
color
minimal
tight
beige
head
not
alot
of
aromas
to
note
mostly
sour
faint
beerlike
smells
taste
was
decent
lots
of
sweet
malt
flavors
then
finish
lacked
any
hop
kick
a
touch
thin
and
slimy
finish
it
paired
well
with
lunch
i
had
no
idea
it
was
an
ab
product
its
got
to
be
an
amberbock
with
a
different
name
definately
a
very
drinkable
dark
beer
yes
the
head
fades
quickly
but
zb
is
a
very
smooth
easy
beer
there
is
no
lingering
bitterness
that
is
so
common
with
other
dark
beers
it
has
a
malty
flavor
that
compliments
any
meat
dish
quite
well
drink
very
cold
pours
a
light
brown
tea
color
has
a
better
head
than
most
macros
but
fades
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
rather
bland
as
is
the
taste
it
is
hard
to
describe
due
to
not
much
character
there
is
nearly
no

at
all
it

its

qualities
and
yes
i
could
consume
quite
a
few
of
these
although
it
is
way
down
on
the

probably
wont
drink
it

overall
really
avoid
drink
tap
water
not
a
good
beer
very
little
taste
but
if
you
have
a
gluten
allergy
then
its
better
then
nothing
i
guess
nose
sweet
sour
bread
i
guess
sorghum
moldiness
grains
taste
like
crappy
club
soda
strange
tartness
cidery
another
underwhelming
gluten
couldnt
finish
this
one
glutenfree
beer
is
ridiculous
a
very
poor
selection
didnt
know
this
was
made
by
anheuser
busch
it
was
on
the
list
at
bowling
not
bad
crystal
clear
watery
sweet
with
a
bit
of
citrus
from
the
hops
but
no
bready
malt
flavours
to
balance
this
lager
yeast
doesnt
taste
much
like
lager
i
know
its
glutenfree
but
eh
there
are
definitely
much
better
i
e
greens
simply
awful
did
not
realize
it
was
a
gluten
free
beer
mad
by
ab
better
off
drinking
coors
light
unless
you
really
need
something
gluten
free
but
then
why
even
drink
beer
goes
down
smooth
clean
finish
cant
tell
the
gluten
is
missing
good
beer
a
good
glutenfree
beer
a
little
tastier
and
more
fullbodied
than
bud
light
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
little
more
than
a
glorified
budweiser
has
a
little
bit
of
an
amber
or
red
color
heavility
carbonated
and
not
much
on
the
flavor
side
there
is
a
bit
of
a
back
side
taste
but
im
not
sure
what
it
is
because
its
not
prominent
i
had
no
idea
it
was
a
gluten
free
beer
when
i
bought
my
grocery
store
had
it
up
in
with
the
porters
in
the
mixed
pak
selection
area
thank
goodness
i
only
got
one
is
this
beer
this
is
a
very
meh
beer
overall
its
not
terrible
but
its
not
remarkable
either
its
very
reminiscent
of
other
wheat
beers
though
it
contains
no
wheat
its
smooth
drinking
and
refreshing
but
does
have
a
hard
to
describe
off
taste
on
the
back
end
perhaps
thats
the
sorghum
not
sure
its
not
very
hoppy
though
you
can
taste
the
hops
im
not
picking
up
any
fruit
some
spice
peppercoriander
perhaps
o
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
guess
i
should
not
be
surprised
since
it
is
essentially
a
sorghum
version
of
a
bmc
beer
rather
bland
with
something
unpleasant
in
the
finish
this
is
not
a
beer
i
will
be
grabbing
again
anytime
soon
much
better
glutenfree
options
out
there
needs
more
oomph
goes
down
smooth
glutenfree
is
an
advantage
but
the
taste
fizzles
out
and
leaves
you
wondering
what
happened
i
enjoy
a
bottle
once
in
a
while
but
theres
no
story
to
it
all
in
all
it
definitely
tastes
better
than
what
goes
under
the
bridge
redbridge
from
anheuserbusch
is
a
gluten
free
brew
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
little
to
no
head
but
it
is
a
white
head
the
smell
is
ok
nothing
special
but
good
the
taste
is
smooth
and
it
goes
down
well
there
is
no
bad
aftertaste
at
all
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
to
drink
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
i
am
pouring
it
out
and
shooting
the
glass
to
put
it
out
of
its
misery
o
not
bad
for
what
it
is
interesting
taste
btw
i
think
there
should
be
a
glutenfree
style
this
definitely
has
more
in
common
with
something
like
harvester
than
brooklyn
lager
anheuserbusch
redbridge

o
i
had
never
had
a
sorghum
beer
beforepicked
this
one
up
for
a
glutenfree
guest
im
not
too
impressed
the
taste
is
odd
and
its
a
little
on
the
watery
side
overall
nope
not
doing
this
one
again
that
is
for
sure
not
too
nice
drinking
when
i
first
smelled
this
beer
i
thought
the
smell
was
off
like
burnt
rubber
and
sweet
when
poured
the
beer
was
an
amber
color
with
little
to
no
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
tasted
watered
down
with
sorghum
flavors
but
still
lacking
a
lasting
flavor
that
would
make
me
want
to
drink
in
this
case
i
wouldnt
choose
this
beer
to
drink
with
a
gluten
allergy
overall
average
for
a
gluten
free
if
you
class
it
with
real
ambers
like
they
have
it
on
beer
advocate
it
would
be
pure
sht
id
only
give
it
a
2
tops
but
for
a
gluten
free
a
3
out
of
5
overall
hey
not
bad
for
a
gluten
free
option
in
this
category
beggars
cant
be
choosers
rating
by
style
its
above
average
in
my
books
no
overall
not
very
good
will
never
drink
again
o
really
it
must
be
a
lot
harder
to
make
gf
beer
than
i
think
this
is
pathetic
poured
out
as
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
no
head
retention
or
lacing
here
the
smell
is
different
its
not
exactly
grainy
but
i
think
i
can
tell
that
it
has
something
in
there
since
its
gluten
free
there
are
some
yeast
aromas
and
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
but
nothing
else
really
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
rather
bland
in
my
opinion
the
flavors
are
earthy
and
nothing
really
pops
out
otherwise
the
mouthfeel
is
arbonated
and
light
bodied
drinkable
but
not
really
all
that
pleasing
overall
it
was
decent
but
nothing
i
would
purchase
in
the
future
overall
its
quite
drinkable
but
for
some
reason
i
usually
get
heartburn
from
this
beer
pours
out
to
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
and
amber
color
no
real
head
retention
to
speak
of
aroma
is
berry
apple
and
a
hint
of
ab
banana
and
hopskunk
flavor
is
winelike
reminds
me
of
sherry
or
muscadine
but
is
is
very
faint
with
some
rubbery
skunky
hops
in
the
finish
nothing
resembling
malt
or
cereal
grain
is
in
this
brew
mouthfeel
for
a
lowpoint
beer
is
average
overall
this
is
a
different
taste
sensation
more
like
a
watered
down
melomel
or
a
cider
and
not
much
like
beer
unless
you
count
bad
beer
overall
still
better
than
bud
light
its
drinkable
but
if
i
was
gluten
intolerant
id
choose
other
forms
of
booze
like
hard
liquor
over
this
in
similar
vein
as
na
beers
whats
the
point
this
is
the
glutenfree
beer
id
expect
from
a
big
brewer
like
anheuserbusch
its
a
poor
substitute
even
for
an
average
lager
but
if
you
cant
drink
lager
its
at
least
a
lowcost
option
still
it
pales
in
comparison
to
brunehaut
greens
or
even
american
competitors
like
off
the
grid
the
mouthfeel
is
strange
but
the
flavor
is
at
least
reminiscent
of
cornbased
lager
o
for
a
beer
thats
made
with
sorghum
i
have
to
say
that
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
had
no
clue
as
to
what
it
would
taste
like
or
if
it
would
be
any
good
at
all
its
drinkable
and
i
think
people
with
celiac
would
find
its
a
pretty
good
substitute
for
beer
i
think
it
could
use
more
carbonation
which
would
help
carry
the
flavor
and
keep
this
beer
more
exciting
as
you
drink
it
the
farther
into
the
pint
i
get
the
more
my
tongue
says
to
my
brain
yeah
i
get
it
but
thats
a
small
criticism
compared
to
the
freedom
this
offers
to
those
with
celiac
3
0
this
beer
doesnt
come
across
as
extremely
watered
down
and
it
delivers
a
well
balanced
flavor
and
little
to
no
hoppiness
wont
be
buying
this
again
the
worst
of
the
gluten
free
beers
ive
tried
o
interesting
beer
picked
this
up
because
it
intrigued
me
it
was
decent
but
nothing
that
i
would
grab
again
o
i
would
drink
this
again
though
its
boring
o
can
i
please
have
my
wheat
andor
barley
back
sorghum
just
doesnt
cut
it
in
the
flavor
department
honestly
if
i
had
a
gluten
allergy
id
still
stay
clear
of
this
beer
there
are
better
alternatives
that
actually
have
taste
and
flavor
besides
pure
sorghum
at
least
the
big
boys
show
some
effort
in
making
beer
for
those
with
such
an
unfortunate
allergy
as
gluten
but
its
not
a
very
good
one
people
with
these
allergies
can
still
taste
ya
know
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
obviously
wouldnt
seek
it
out
at
a
bar
its
a
below
average
beer
o
by
now
ive
had
most
of
the
major
glutenfree
beers
we
have
a
friend
with
celiacs
and
as
a
brewer
im
curious
about
sorghumbased
beers
i
truly
do
believe
that
the
american
lager
styles
simply
dont
work
well
for
glutenfree
the
belgian
styles
i
find
to
be
better
and
i
believe
that
somebody
can
make
a
decent
sorghum
stout
but
for
some
reason
the
market
seems
to
be
driven
by
people
wanting
a
glutenfree
bud
my
second
glutenfree
beer
following
the
somewhat
surprising
new
grist
lets
do
this
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
faint
comprising
wheat
light
caramel
and
grass
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
taste
is
a
combination
of
fruity
sweetness
mostly
orange
but
with
a
bit
of
white
grape
and
pineapple
syrup
and
spicy
grain
like
pepper
and
cardamomlaced
wheat
a
fakely
sweet
think
candystyle
sugary
here
twang
hangs
over
the
finish
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
didnt
hate
it
either
the
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
the
flavor
combination
is
sorta
confusing
and
the
body
is
too
light
and
fizzy
to
really
be
enjoyable
that
said
not
much
is
actually
offensive
about
this
beer
i
just
know
i
dont
want
another
one
any
time
soon
with
around
one
percent
of
the
population
afflicted
with
celiac
disease
it
would
nice
to
see
more
brewers
step
up
and
brew
glutenfree
offerings
on
the
whole
a
pretty
average
beer
lawnmower
beer
at
best
for
someone
that
does
not
require
gluten
free
redbridge
has
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
a
clear
ambergold
appearance
with
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
grassy
and
sweet
taste
is
an
odd
combination
of
molasses
sweetness
grass
very
slight
hops
other
neutral
grains
and
things
i
cant
even
describe
this
is
a
weird
one
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
and
redbridge
finishes
crisp
and
clean
overall
i
might
have
to
get
used
to
this
one
not
that
id
ever
have
it
again
but
i
rate
it
average
i
guess
its
okay
for
someone
who
cant
have
gluten
o
i
hate
you
bobby
this
was
awful
poured
a
meager
14
head
which
almost
immediately
disappeared
completely
looks
like
a
clear
glass
of
iced
tea
i
detect
next
to
no
smell
even
after
it
warmed
taste
is
a
fairly
standard
bmc
profile
and
they
worked
into
it
that
slight
zing
in
the
aftertaste
you
get
from
the
anheuser
family
there
was
also
something
i
found
hard
to
describe
in
the
taste
which
in
my
notes
i
put
down
as
from
a
dirty
glass
but
which
i
think
another
better
described
as
a
hint
of
watered
down
maple
syrup
allinall
if
you
cant
have
beer
due
to
gluten
allergies
then
im
glad
they
made
this
for
you
but
if
you
dont
have
that
kind
of
allergy
then
skip
this
for
virtually
any
other
real
beer
overall
this
is
not
a
good
beer
its
better
than
most
anheuserbusch
products
and
its
much
better
than
most
gluten
free
beers
having
no
allergies
its
not
one
i
want
to
try
again
overall
i
would
say
i
hated
this
beer
if
you
cannot
have
gluten
you
should
definitely
be
a
homebrewer
if
this
is
the
type
of
beer
there
is
on
the
market
for
you
overall
a
weird
beer
its
not
like
its
a
drain
pour
just
weird
will
probably
never
drink
this
one
again
o
not
a
very
good
beer
its
not
horrible
in
the
sense
that
it
taste
bad
just
not
good
o
i
dont
have
any
gluten
allergies
however
for
people
that
do
this
beer
is
surely
a
blessing
the
aroma
had
a
pleasant
sweet
earthiness
to
it
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
in
the
background
the
flavors
were
the
same
nothing
special
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
drinkability
was
ok
but
not
notable
overall
a
surprisingly
decent
beer
it
wont
ever
be
my
first
choice
but
to
quote
my
friend
amberits
palatable
if
you
have
a
gluten
intolerant
friend
steer
them
towards
this
this
is
interesting
its
not
a
bad
alternative
if
you
cant
drink
beer
but
its
not
something
id
pick
up
mo
the
mouthfeel
is
a
crisp
smooth
clean
feel
that
finishes
off
dry
while
not
a
great
beer
it
is
not
too
bad
and
i
would
tell
anyone
who
cant
have
wheat
or
barley
in
their
diet
to
give
this
beer
a
try
and
decide
from
there
if
it
is
worth
a
second
buy
d
very
surprisingly
good
this
has
a
mild
malt
character
but
this
is
really
pretty
impressive
for
a
gluten
free
beer
more
than
that
there
is
a
well
balanced
mild
but
readily
apparent
spicy
hop
character
that
goes
a
long
way
towards
adding
depth
to
a
relatively
light
beer
in
the
final
analysis
this
is
an
unusually
good
gluten
free
beer
and
it
may
actually
be
the
most
enjoyable
ab
product
that
i
have
tasted
redbridge
is
a
very
clear
golden
beer
with
a
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
and
leaves
decent
lacing
it
has
a
faint
sweet
sorghum
aroma
with
a
note
of
grass
its
very
light
bodied
and
watery
with
a
chalky
finish
theres
hardly
any
flavor
at
all
theres
a
light
sweetness
in
the
finish
it
tastes
like
non
alcoholic
beer
nothing
to
see
here
move
along
almost
no
head
deep
gold
clear
sparkling
body
very
little
lacing
nothing
outstanding
about
the
taste
almost
like
a
light
lager
with
a
little
more
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
watery
fizzy
not
bad
an
alternative
to
the
everyday
american
lagers
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
redbridge
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
macro
pouring
a
gold
color
but
did
have
lasting
lace
the
aroma
was
of
vanilla
orance
and
grass
the
flavor
was
mainly
citrusy
with
ginger
showing
through
as
it
warms
slightly
souring
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
may
pair
well
with
fish
overall
this
beer
is
just
okay
not
recommended
not
bad
but
definitely
different
could
be
good
around
a
campfire
in
autumn
do
i
wont
lie
this
is
drinkable
this
is
not
the
worst
beer
ab
has
ever
came
out
with
surprisingly
enjoyable
to
a
degree
but
watery
non
to
say
the
least
poured
a
clear
medium
amber
with
virtually
no
head
and
no
lacing
at
all
the
aroma
was
of
a
cereal
malt
resin
hops
and
a
horse
blanket
yeast
it
tasted
lightly
bitter
from
start
to
finish
with
bearly
any
flavor
at
all
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
very
flat
carbonation
overall
it
is
typical
brew
from
anheuserbusch
inbev
and
will
most
likely
be
my
last
glutenfree
beer
as
well
from
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
march
1
2011
the
pour
is
a
golden
pale
yellow
with
nice
clarity
and
a
shortlived
white
fizzy
head
the
aromas
tend
to
be
of
flour
and
light
yeast
the
taste
is
missing
something
and
seems
like
of
bland
although
there
is
a
thin
hop
ending
this
beer
is
a
light
amber
color
with
no
lacing
and
little
head
it
has
a
sweeter
aroma
with
cood
carbination
it
has
a
watery
taste
because
its
gulten
free
it
has
an
off
flavor
or
less
flavor
then
a
regulair
beer
overall
if
you
had
a
problem
with
gluten
this
might
not
be
bad
but
if
you
dont
and
you
enjoy
your
beer
you
should
go
for
a
different
beer
not
very
good
and
it
certainly
isnt
hair
of
the
dog
dave
dammit
d
very
watery
i
had
a
hard
time
d
as
this
is
the
only
gluten
free
beer
in
the
area
i
would
hate
to
have
celiac
disease
verdict
i
cant
really
come
down
too
hard
on
this
beer
considering
it
has
a
limited
ingredient
list
for
a
reason
but
there
is
certainly
room
for
improvement
the
taste
is
super
light
lighter
than
most
beers
i
have
ever
tried
blame
it
on
the
sorghum
i
suppose
i
was
hoping
that
there
could
be
something
else
here
roasted
smoky
flavors
some
citrus
zest
some
chocolate
anything
but
i
feel
like
the
beer
is
weak
in
flavor
for
light
beer
drinkers
or
cider
lovers
its
all
you
may
ever
need
sorghum
drinkers
enjoy
c
2
8
d
if
you
need
to
i
guess
id
personally
rather
have
stomach
cramps
and
a
real
beer
i
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
lot
and
id
gladly
drink
it
even
though
i
have
no
gluten
allergies
its
easygoing
but
certainly
more
flavorful
than
the
typical
macrobrew
im
really
glad
anheuserbusch
tapped
into
this
market
as
a
quencher
on
a
warm
day
id
grab
one
of
these
in
a
heartbeat
d
this
was
a
good
bit
better
than
the
greens
tripel
i
tried
but
i
hope
for
her
sake
that
her
stress
is
short
lived
one
finger
head
of
loose
bubbles
with
streaky
lace
with
some
cling
color
is
a
7
on
the
srm
chart
smells
of
molasses
and
clover
taste
is
sweet
molasses
with
some
bite
from
the
hops
very
watery
feeling
in
my
mouth
i
guess
it
is
better
than
no
beer
at
all
and
better
than
many
i
have
tasted
from
this
brewery
d
its
something
of
a
reasonnable
option
for
gluten
intolerant
people
not
a
great
beer
by
most
standards
but
it
would
be
better
than
nothing
and
it
certainly
could
be
worse
commendations
to
anheuserbusch
for
supporting
the
growing
number
of
people
with
gluten
wheat
or
barley
allergies
however
dont
let
that
dissuade
you
from
trying
this
one
as
it
stands
on
its
own
merits
pouring
a
nice
redamber
with
average
lacing
this
sorghumbased
beer
has
a
sweet
molasses
nose
and
a
rich
and
malty
flavor
the
hops
content
seems
subdued
pushing
this
one
towards
an
overbearing
sweetness
rather
than
a
wellbalanced
mix
still
an
easytodrink
beer
and
certainly
steps
above
mainstream
american
lagers
drinkability
this
beer
is
downright
terrible
the
only
reason
im
giving
higher
marks
than
i
should
is
that
i
recognize
that
this
beer
is
meant
for
people
with
a
gluten
allergy
not
regular
consumers
if
i
had
a
gluten
allergy
this
beer
would
be
a
lifesaver
that
said
as
a
standalone
beer
this
is
pretty
terrible
d
just
not
very
pleasant
it
is
missing
something
like
half
of
all
the
good
stuff
that
makes
beer
beer
i
know
this
is
gluten
free
and
good
for
that
i
just
tried
this
because
ive
never
had
a
gluten
free
beer
and
this
maybe
my
last
not
a
great
beer
for
my
taste
light
and
crisp
this
went
down
easy
but
just
lacks
any
real
flavor
it
wasnt
bad
just
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
d
deffinately
drinkable
and
i
will
recommend
this
to
people
with
gluten
problems
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
at
all
this
is
the
second
glutenfree
beer
ive
had
and
im
really
glad
that
my
body
has
no
problems
with
glutens
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
not
really
worth
anything
either
redbridge
drinks
like
a
macro
with
the
price
tag
of
craft
sorry
to
say
it
but
i
think
i
just
needs
gluten
in
my
beer
feeldrink
light
mouthfeel
drinkablity
isnt
bad
at
all
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
if
i
had
a
gluten
alergy
an
acquired
taste
but
if
you
have
celiac
disease
this
would
be
your
savior
right
now
set
aside
all
of
that
and
redbridge
is
a
most
interesting
beer
and
worth
a
try
if
you
like
your
beer
on
the
sweet
side
we
could
see
pairing
this
with
a
slowcooked
pot
roast
and
roasted
root
vegetables
redbridge
pours
a
light
caramel
color
with
a
transparent
body
and
an
interesting
nose
that
combines
caramel
and
light
molasses
there
is
virtually
no
head
of
foam
on
this
beer
and
the
small
amount
present
disappears
in
less
than
one
minute
the
flavors
i
notice
are
that
of
light
fruit
mostly
apple
sugar
caramel
light
cider
light
hops
and
light
grainbread
im
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
but
i
believe
it
was
my
first
gluten
free
beer
12
oz
brown
bottle
poured
a
light
amberorangey
copper
color
little
head
that
disappears
fast
to
nithing
aroma
i
guess
is
the
sorghum
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
before
so
i
cannot
tell
it
smells
medicinal
and
lightly
woody
caramel
malt
almost
taste
is
very
medicinal
and
some
wood
going
on
with
a
almost
metallic
blood
note
very
unique
and
different
taste
it
isnt
bad
just
different
feel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
alot
of
carbonation
hitting
the
tongue
easily
drinkable
and
sessionable
but
i
can
see
this
taste
being
more
love
it
or
hate
it
give
this
a
try
its
very
interesting
ill
have
to
take
a
look
for
more
of
this
style
of
beer
not
having
tried
the
gluten
free
beer
style
before
if
unable
to
drink
regular
styles
i
could
find
these
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
maybe
even
a
cold
winter
nite
you
know
i
dont
have
a
gluten
wheat
allergy
so
i
dont
really
see
why
i
would
even
try
this
but
my
roommates
girlfriend
does
and
this
was
brought
home
and
i
gave
it
a
go
it
has
a
carbonated
bubbliness
to
it
its
very
alcohol
tasting
some
lime
in
there
im
almost
thinking
gin
and
tonic
in
a
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
and
yeast
taste
is
of
hops
some
notes
of
citrus
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
a
little
different
and
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
would
buy
it
again
if
i
was
on
a
gluten
free
diet
i
had
bought
this
by
mistake
and
when
i
noticed
the
gluten
free
and
realized
who
the
brewer
was
i
thought
oh
oh
redbridge
was
surprisingly
good
though
better
than
a
lot
of
other
craftimport
lagers
red
or
otherwise
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
not
my
new
go
to
beer
but
i
find
it
very
respectable
a
decent
and
flavorful
amber
worth
a
try
i
must
say
i
love
the
label
design
of
this
beer
very
well
done
not
the
one
pictured
taste
there
is
a
imitation
sweetness
with
an
aftertaste
similar
to
a
diet
pop
very
bizarre
taste
which
is
hard
to
describe
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
several
other
organic
beers
that
i
would
pick
before
this
one
i
was
expecting
something
different
and
original
and
it
sure
was
different
but
i
will
not
be
buying
it
again
taste
is
interesting
quite
earthy
with
a
fair
amount
of
leafy
hop
flavor
there
is
definitely
plenty
of
sweetness
there
but
it
is
not
overly
distracting
it
has
some
grape
flavors
in
it
and
lends
itself
a
mild
winelike
characteristic
without
the
malted
barley
it
really
loses
quite
a
bit
of
the
qualities
that
make
a
beer
a
beer
it
is
far
removed
from
an
amber
ale
but
i
feel
that
i
am
rating
this
one
more
as
a
gluten
free
offering
way
better
than
the
only
other
glutenfree
beer
i
have
had
unfortunately
i
think
if
i
was
intolerant
to
gluten
i
would
not
drink
any
beer
at
all
and
probably
stick
to
wine
an
okay
beer
i
guess
it
would
do
the
job
if
i
could
consume
gluten
since
its
a
sorghum
beer
better
than
nothing
but
lets
just
say
im
glad
gluten
doesnt
bother
me
overall
its
much
better
than
i
had
anticipated
a
little
to
thin
to
be
good
but
not
bad
clear
light
amber
with
a
splotchy
eggshell
head
that
leaves
a
little
lace
on
the
glass
faint
maple
cream
smell
the
flavor
has
a
mild
kind
of
yeasty
molasses
sweetness
to
it
with
a
mild
smack
of
lemony
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
and
easy
enough
to
drink
this
is
easily
the
best
of
the
three
or
four
gluten
free
beers
ive
had
this
at
least
tastes
like
beer
i
have
been
struggling
with
a
wheat
allergy
and
consequently
though
i
am
not
allergic
to
rye
and
barley
per
se
i
definately
feel
better
when
i
dont
consume
them
having
said
all
of
this
i
tried
a
redbridge
red
lager
gluten
free
beer
last
night
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
liked
it
i
am
generally
not
a
big
ab
fan
though
i
recently
tried
the
great
american
ale
and
liked
that
as
well
they
have
done
a
first
rate
job
here
though
i
would
never
confuse
this
for
a
craft
brewed
specialty
beer
or
ale
it
tastes
surprisingly
good
the
taste
falls
between
a
pale
ale
and
a
classic
lager
flavor
malty
mildly
citrusy
with
caramel
notes
as
well
as
a
mid
range
hoppy
finish
i
would
recommend
anyone
who
finds
they
have
glutenwheat
issues
to
give
redbridge
a
try
i
was
told
by
another
customer
at
my
local
beer
store
that
this
beer
is
kosher
for
passover
because
it
doesnt
have
any
yeast
in
it
well
thats
fun
to
know
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
dough
and
sickly
sweet
malt
flavor
is
actually
better
than
i
expected
some
sweet
fruits
honey
and
doughy
malt
palate
is
thin
but
not
terrible
drinkable
ok
i
am
still
very
glad
that
im
not
glutenintolerant
but
this
beer
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
drinkability
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
considering
the
glutenfree
circumstances
this
is
probably
a
really
good
beer
pours
a
clear
light
red
brownish
colored
body
smalllish
creamcolored
head
diminishing
good
lacing
looks
thick
and
sticky
sweet
almost
grainy
taste
almost
like
rice
or
corn
vegetably
malty
and
bitter
at
the
beginning
almost
like
a
fake
sugar
aftertaste
drying
okay
bitter
hoppy
aroma
some
of
that
offflavored
maltiness
too
sweet
tasting
overall
this
was
a
very
unique
beer
i
am
glad
i
got
it
from
a
buddy
as
i
would
be
disappointed
if
i
had
bought
it
as
it
wasnt
something
that
pleased
me
i
still
have
a
nasty
aftertaste
left
in
my
mouth
d
this
is
pretty
unpleasant
i
finished
the
bottle
but
i
wasnt
happy
about
it
i
dont
know
if
its
a
problem
with
barleyless
beers
in
general
or
just
abs
effort
but
i
wouldnt
try
this
again
had
a
bottle
from
a
mixed
case
recently
in
the
world
of
glutenfree
beers
redbridge
is
certainly
blander
than
the
rest
but
its
also
the
most
drinkable
i
often
find
theres
a
cloying
sweetness
in
a
lot
of
the
celiac
beers
but
this
simply
resembles
a
light
amber
ale
i
guess
considering
the
source
and
style
this
isnt
a
half
bad
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
54
inch
head
with
slight
retention
ad
decent
lacing
smells
mostly
of
a
sweet
grain
im
assuming
rye
i
guess
it
fits
the
style
id
put
it
in
its
own
category
of
a
rye
beer
has
a
smooth
and
crisp
mouth
feel
with
average
carbonation
tastes
mostly
of
a
lager
with
a
sweet
rye
flavor
theres
also
a
distinct
metallicacidic
aftertaste
overall
a
little
weak
in
body
and
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
odd
other
comments
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
nonmalt
brew
but
theres
a
reason
malt
is
used
in
beer
it
makes
it
taste
good
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
unless
i
had
to
for
medical
reasons
though
i
was
in
no
way
impressed
by
this
i
guess
finding
out
on
the
backend
that
it
was
from
ab
proves
that
im
not
a
snob
about
ab
i
just
dont
like
them
with
a
few
rare
exceptions
now
for
the
bad
news
i
believe
i
have
had
a
reaction
to
redbridge
multiple
times
i
dont
know
if
there
is
contamination
shared
facilities
shared
grain
storage
or
if
its
all
in
my
head
but
redbridge
means
a
gluten
reaction
for
me
and
i
wont
drink
it
give
it
a
shot
but
use
caution
d
its
always
kind
of
funny
when
a
brewery
that
makes
terrible
beer
tries
to
make
a
good
one
usually
it
turns
out
mediocre
just
like
redbridge
this
is
just
an
uninteresting
piece
of
brewing
stick
to
what
you
know
anheuserbusch
which
is
making
bad
beer
this
brew
pours
a
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
medium
thick
and
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
burns
off
quickly
spotty
lacing
aroma
of
grain
and
bready
malt
lightbodied
with
a
mildly
bitter
hops
character
and
flavors
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
the
finish
is
short
and
lightly
bitter
below
average
and
completely
forgettable
overall
d
not
something
id
buy
or
drink
on
a
regular
basis
would
only
drink
it
if
it
were
the
last
available
chioce
having
tried
a
number
of
glutenfree
versions
of
normally
glutencontaining
products
i
can
sincerely
say
that
redbridge
is
fairly
successful
endeavor
many
small
brand
expensive
riceamaranthpotatoarrowrootwhatever
breads
and
pastas
are
far
worse
glutenfree
versions
of
their
products
than
this
beer
while
this
beer
gets
a
c
compared
to
the
richness
of
other
beers
its
a
great
glutenfree
product
from
a
major
brewer
kudos

im
impressed
not

as
i
was
expecting
and
more
affordable
than
the

up
if
i
had
celiac
this

would
definitely
do
the
trick
if
nothing
else
was
a
possibility
on
its
own
i
would
drink
this
over

any
day
mouthfeel
is
light

definitely
has
a
sturdy

its
not
over
done

is
a
well
engineered

drinkability
overall
let
me
reiterate
not
bad
enjoyable
definitely
better
than
a
budweiser
go
for
it
d
not
something
id
drink
often
even
if
i
could
not
tolerate
gluten
id
probably
choose
a
dry
cider
over
this
though
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
things
coming
from
ab
and
id
recommend
checking
it
out
if
you
have
issues
with
gluten
d
ok
drinkability
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
taste
was
decent
but
the
mouthfeel
was
average
at
best
worth
a
try
if
you
want
to
but
nothing
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer

the

i
could
drink
this
again
and
would
rather
have
it
than
almost
all
of
the
other
ab
offerings
d
a
good
alternative
for
those
who
suffer
from

though
would
not
satisfy
the
big

beer
enthusiasts
stout

a
malty
textured
ale
at
best
but
deserves
some
props
even
if
it
is
ab
drinkability
i
didnt
care
for
it
pretty
much
water
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
it
try
it
just
to
say
you
tried
a
sorghum
beer
but
dont
get
a
sixer
i
have
never
had
a
wheat
and
barley
free
beer
so
i
decided
to
try
it
out
for
shits
and
giggles
had
it
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
lucid
yellow
color
that
turns
orange
in
the
light
and
virtually
no
head
smell
is
of
lights
hops
and
a
slight
sweetness
the
sorghum
taste
is
a
little
musky
hoppy
with
some
slight
sweetness
and
a
crisp
fimish
i
guess
it
would
be
ideal
for
anyone
allergic
to
gluten
poor
bastards
overall
this
was
a
good
alternative
for
people
that
cannot
drink
for
dietary
reasons
however
for
me
it
was
not
a
good
alternative
and
i
do
not
think
i
will
be
heading
in
this
direction
again
it
was
just
too
bland
for
me
nothing
really
going
on
with
it
could
be
worse
though
and
still
better
then
most
of
the
macro
stuff
you
see
well
its
okay
not
that
bad
not
that
good
if
i
was
stuck
to
a
glutenfree
lifestyle
im
sure
id
enjoy
it
and
be
thankful
that
it
is
so
widely
distributed
as
it
warms
slightly
the
biting
carbonation
reduces
a
little
and
it
becomes
more
palatable
i
was
moderately
surprised
with
no
other
beers
to
compare
it
to
that
ive
sampled
id
say
good
job
my
go
to
beer
if
i
could
not
have
gluten
dreally
not
that
bad
i
could
drink
a
couple
these
it
is
certainly
better
that
bud
bud
light
mich
etc
drinkability
is
average
not
a
bad
drink
but
not
one
id
go
out
and
purchase
drinkability
not
as
bad
as
i
heard
but
i
dont
plan
on
buying
it
again
a
man
can
not
live
on
gluten
alone
but
i
probably
wont
actively
seek
this
one
out
again
for
those
with
celiac
disease
or
others
with
a
glutenfree
diet
that
couldnt
normally
partake
in
a
beer
this
is
a
nice
alternative
this
is
not
an
amber
or
red
lager
this
is
an
awful
foul
tasting
specialty
grain
sorghum
beer
poured
clear
copper
with
little
head
that
disappeared
fast
very
little
smell
and
what
little
there
was
smelled
of
a
kind
of
non
alcoholic
beer
type
maltiness
think
kaliber
wow
taste
is
bland
and
an
immediate
watery
finish
this
has
no
redeeming
qualities
other
than
not
being
made
with
barley
i
guess
if
youre
allergic
avoid
like
the
plague
d
this
is
pretty
much
just
an
average
beer
this
could
be
a
session
beer
if
choices
are
slim
its
the
first
gluten
free
beer
that
ive
had
and
its
not
bad
its
just
average
d
drinkable
enough
id
be
willing
to
drink
it
again
if
it
were
presented
to
me
i
wouldnt
buy
it
for
myself
however
d
this
is
an
okay
brew
its
way
overpriced
thank
goodness
im
not
allergic
to
wheat
or
barley
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
went
really
well
with
a
nice
steak
and
shrimp
dinner
oelergud
drinkability
interestingly
different
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
drinkability
is
considerably
better
than
id
expected
although
the
seems
nothing
like
a
lager
bearing
more
of
the
characteristics
of
an
ale
altogether
id
say
that
it
makes
for
a
good
tipple
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
on
the
other
hand
i
am
not
affected
by
celiacs
disorder
and
those
who
are
might
prefer
a
more
readilyavailable
bud
light
but
ill
raise
one
in
anheuserbuschs
name
for
doing
their
part
to
do
some
good
for
a
growing
market
segment
drinkability
those
poor
celiacs
have
enough
problems
without
having
to
deal
with
this
i
wouldnt
classify
it
as
a
traditional
american
amber
ale
though
its
made
with
sorghum
and
should
be
classified
separately
similar
to
how
wheat
beers
are
classified
very
drinkable
though
and
if
i
had
celiac
disease
i
would
probably
drink
this
beer
its
different
but
it
doesnt
make
me
want
to
pour
it
down
a
drain
so
thats
a
good
thing
extremely
drinkable
for
a
gluten
free
product
richer
malt
like
profile
then
any
of
the
other
gf
beer
si
have
tried
so
far
its
certainly
worth
a
try
this
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
in
color
with
a
mild
white
head
at
first
waft
all
i
smell
is
a
metallic
note
i
smell
again
and
get
a
mild
hit
of
green
apple
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
quite
mild
however
i
do
taste
an
apparent
green
apple
flavor
the
after
taste
is
that
of
the
bottle
cap
metal
body
is
light
with
a
nice
tingly
effervescents
not
really
for
me
but
if
you
cant
have

or
barley
drink
up
the
beer

a
modest

a
very
slight
hint
of
hops
crisp

a
pleasant

sweet
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
at
the
back
top
is
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
determined
acidity
the
hops
very
mild
but
present
and
accounted
for
somewhat
sweet
quite
dry
aftertaste
not
a
total
drain
pour
but
did
not
appeal
to
me
but
there
certainly
could
be
an
audience
overall
id
say
that
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
if
somebody
handed
me
one
id
drink
it
and
thank
them
for
it
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
for
myself

reminds

there
is
no

in

i
would
recommend
this
to
my
friends
and
i
definetly
will
be
buying
again
if
this
was
all
i
could
drink
i
could
used

i
have
other

try

way

d
all
i
have
to
say
is
i
am
glad
im
not
allergic
to

gluten
but
not
a
terrible
offering
from

tasting
than

is
not
one
i
would
want
to
pay
for
again

obviously
since
the
beer
is
made
without
malt
and
wheat
it
has
a
unique
aroma
it
is
really
is
hard
to
describe
but
there
is
no
familiar
malt
smells
just
a
sweet
and
slightly
chalky
aroma
that
is
the
best
i
can
describe
it
the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
pretty
faint
and
lacking
the
malty
characteristics
that
i
love
in
beer
there
really
is
not
much
flavor
to
pick
up
on
and
the
little
bit
of
flavor
that
peaks
through
is
not
very
good
at
all
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
brew
i
know
and
understand
that
this
is
a
glutenfree

this
is
only
an

at

on
the

would
drink
again

beer
is
unique
especially
to
me
since
it
is
the
first
gluten
free
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
image
though
that
even
though
it
is
made
with
out
wheat
or
barley
it
should
have
more
flavor
than
it
does
i
will
give
it
some
credit
being
an
anheuser
bush
beer
i
cant
expect
a
whole
heck
of
a

now
to
the
break
down
the
beer
has
a
surprisingly
deep
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
a
head
to
it

is
disappointing
has
a

if
i
can
call
it
that
id
highly

must

that

beers

would
probably

one

the
best
balanced
beers
out
there
in
my
opinion

certainly
one
of
the
most
rewarding
amber
lagers
this
is
a
gorgeous
amber
beer
with
a
solid
34in
head
there
was
a
bit
of
tang
in
the
nose
with
an
overall
excellent
aroma
the
flavor
was
mostly
malty
and
sweet
but
really
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
there
i
expected
a
little
more
based
on
the
aroma
however
it
certainly
lives
up
to
its
claim
of
smoothness
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
drink
it
while
it
is
cold
though
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
when
it
starts
to
warm
up

neighbor
brought
a
bottle
to
me

clear

no

in

which
i
expected
based
on
the
description
on
the
bottle
felt
a
little
tingly
at
first
but
mellowed
to
a
smoother
feel
as
it
warmed
and
settled
overall
a
good
smooth
beer
but
a
tad
on
the
bland
side
for
my
taste
my
favorite
beer
they
do
a
wonderful
job
making
sure
there
is
no
difference
in
the
tap
and
the
bottle
amazing
i
cant
wait
for
it
to
be
available
everywhere
i
had
this
beer
the
first
time
a
the
mellow
mushroom
in
greensboro
nc
it
went
great
with
everything
and
ive
been
in
love
since
ive
never
been
a
big
beer
drinker
but
red
oak
has
changed
my
ways
and
had
showed
me
there
is
more
to
beer
not
just
miller
and
budweiser
beers
im
so
half
i
have
found
them
o
pretty
solid
red
not
crazy
different
but
strong
none
the
less
worth
looking
for
when
you
are
in
the
nc
now
that
i
have
grown
up
and
my
tastes
have
changed
to
preferring
less
sweet
beers
but
without
this
beer
i
wouldnt
have
gone
through
the
journey
of
craft
beer
discovery
trying
to
find
that
flavor
that
red
oak
provided
me
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
i
was
wishful
this
was
going
to
be
a
good
beer
since
i
had
to
travel
300
miles
to
get
the
20
12
pack
the
beer
poured
a
pretty
gas
colored
brew
with
a
pretty
tan
head
the
head
did
not
last
very
long
the
beer
smelled
a
bit
sour
that
worried
me
well
the
taste
was
not
too
bad
i
thought
itty
bitty
bit
of
sour
maybe
and
a
little
sweet
however
after
a
few
days
of
having
one
now
and
then
i
have
decided
i
will
not
buy
this
again
it
just
aint
worth
the
money
to
be
average
o
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
is
really
enjoyable
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
munich
helles
lager
with
a
bit
of
an
american
accent
o
very
serviceable
amber
good
balance
and
went
well
with
my
buffalo
chicken
o
pretty
good
example
of
the
american
amber
style
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
not
sure
why
but
every
woman
i
know
really
likes
this
one
i
would
certainly
have
this
again
even
though
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
what
it
advertises
fresh
and
good
nothing
world
class
here
just
a
solid
drinkable
beer
overall
very
drinkable
but
also
very
simple
making
this
anoether
not
terrible
not
memorable
beer
smooth
drink
with
a
sort
of
sweet
aftertaste
tastes
like
a
better
yuenglingkillians
i
am
absolutely
fanatical
about
the
beer
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
almost
too
drinkable
ill
slip
up
and
drink
a
whole
12
pack
on
a
friday
night
doing
stuff
around
the
house
18

a
pop
makes
the
wife
sad
it
wont
blow
your
mind
in
any
way
but
it
will
go
down
smooth
with
no
off
flavors
at
all
o
solid
and
sessionworthy
mediumdark
lager
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
recent
full
sail
ltd
release
one
with
a
similar
weight
modest
flavor
balanced
nuttiness
and
drinkability
the
label
brags
about
strict
adherence
to
the
1516
reinheitsgebot
purity
law
and
liberally
uses
the
words
fresh
and
pure
all
across
its
label
i
get
it
fresh
and
pure
and
good
too
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
thanks
jeff
this
improves
a
bit
as
it
warms
ive
had
these
around
all
week
and
theyve
grown
on
me
i
find
the
twelve
packs
a
little
pricey
but
i
certainly
wont
complain
anytime
anyone
wants
to
gift
me
some
overall
i
would
never
purchase
a
12
pack
of
these
but
i
enjoyed
it
from
notes
12012
o
the
quick
and
dirty
way
to
describe
this
beer
in
my
eyes
is
a
more
fresh
and
slightly
thicker
yuengling
great
easy
drinking
amber
perfect
to
have
readily
available
at
college
overall
this
beer
is
an
amber
lager
and
is
as
simple
as
they
come
if
you
enjoy
yuengling
youll
enjoy
this
beer
even
more
i
am
going
to
recommend
this
to
my
yuengling
drinkers
and
would
not
mind
purchasing
this
beer
again
next
time
im
in
the
raleigh
area
speaking
of
drinking
quick
the
mouthfeel
is
conducive
to
that
smooth
with
a
hint
of
creamy
and
a
pop
of
carbonation
this
brew
tastes
great
and
goes
down
as
easy
as
a
5
hooker
well
worth
trying
and
one
that
id
buy
again
and
again
the
beer
appears
rusty
orange
with
a
wispy
off
white
head
the
aroma
brings
sweet
malt
fruit
alcohol
thin
with
sweet
fruity
alcohol
no
off
flavors
per
se
but
just
not
my
thing
bland
lacking
depth
and
complexity
too
sweet
to
enjoy
more
than
one
trying
the
red
oak
amber
lager
at
taste
of
carolina
located
in
teh
b
concourse
of
charlotte
airport
the
beer
poured
a
copperamber
color
with
weak
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
was
barleymalt
the
taste
was
very
grainy
with
barley
not
much
to
cheer
or
rave
about
when
compared
to
the
omb
copper
this
doesnt
hold
a
candle
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
big
carbontation
hoestly
this
is
like
mic
ultra
amber
overall
not
a
good
beer
when
compared
to
others
in
this
family
definitely
on
my
list
of
likes
have
recommended
to
several
friends
over
a
nice
beer
to
have
while
passing
through
n
carolina
had
this
beer
last
weekend
at
hams
in
greensboro
its
a
nice
brew
with
a
smooth
taste
the
taste
and
color
remind
me
of
yuengling
traditional
lager
but
a
smoother
taste
nice
mouthfeel
with
some
almost
sweet
notes
i
have
also
had
this
from
a
bottle
but
i
prefer
it
on
tap
overall
a
quality
beer
with
a
good
taste
and
feel
o
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
ever
tasted
which
makes
it
incredibly
easy
to
drink
the
lightness
of
the
body
and
the
dry
finish
make
this
a
quality
beer
not
sold
on
this
one
my
brother
swears
by
it
i
think
i
would
have
liked
this
one
more
it
wasnt
so
creamy
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
more
crisp
and
clean
red
oak
is
a
nice
little
brewery
so
ill
revisit
and
give
them
their
fair
due
sticky
sweet
malt
hit
that
grows
cloying
as
the
beer
warms
tons
of
malt
body
here
very
sweet
caramel
finish
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
o
great
to
try
for
no
other
reason
than
its
local
probably
just
a
tick
under
sa
boston
lager
but
the
freshness
makes
up
a
bit
for
the
slightly
less
balanced
flavor
o
a
nice
solid
amber
lager
i
like
the
story
of
how
it
sticks
to
lager
natural
law
was
a
nice
present
getting
a
case
comes
from
a
friend
in
north
carolina
he
had
it
when
he
was
down
there
at
the
brewery
not
a
bad
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
lager
beer
looks
good
and
has
the
lager
beer
smell
but
just
not
that
exciting
may
have
been
the
build
up
of
having
a
beer
here
in
michigan
that
you
cant
buy
in
michigan
would
like
to
try
it
there
to
be
a
better
judge
of
it
i
drank
it
with
no
problem
just
was
not
a
great
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
initially
impressed
by
the
color
head
was
an
off
white
color
and
the
aroma
had
a
bit
of
a
sweet
smell
the
taste
was
lackluster
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
since
i
heard
they
would
be
bottling
and
really
wanted
to
enjoy
this
i
did
not
i
may
try
another
offering
from
here
but
not
this
one
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
beer
mug
beautiful
amber
color
only
a
small
12
inch
head
with
not
much
lacing
smell
not
much
malty
with
a
little
caramel
the
taste
is
about
the
same
malty
caramel
and
a
hint
of
nuttiness
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
good
very
drinkable
i
like
this
better
than
another
local
brewerys
amber
natty
greenes
but
thats
not
saying
a
lot
overall
an
okay
amber
but
nothing
special
i
wouldnt
really
seek
this
one
out
again
it
really
is
hard
to
find
a
good
amber
d
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
had
a
very
unique
feel
and
taste
to
it
for
a
lager
the
weihenstephan
yeast
cultures
and
oak
aging
definitely
helped
give
this
beer
a
good
smooth
crisp
flavor
definitely
worth
a
try
for
any
beer
lover
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
copper
with
a
practically
nonexistent
head
smell
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
bread
and
clove
taste
is
all
up
front
and
spicy
mouthfeel
is
average
but
the
carbonation
is
too
high
drinkability
is
decent
i
didnt
like
the
way
this
beer
smelled
or
tasted
when
i
first
poured
it
but
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
decided
it
was
just
ok
i
see
no
reason
to
buy
this
one
again
overall
the
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
red
oak
has
hit
the
style
on
the
head
doing
nothing
over
the
top
and
creating
a
fine
amber
lager
clear
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
sweet
bready
grainy
malt
aroma
theres
something
artificial
and
offputting
about
it
less
sweetness
makes
the
flavor
more
enjoyable
honey
toasted
bread
caramel
light
bitterness
clean
mediumlight
mouthfeel
theres
just
something
about
this
beer
that
isnt
quite
right
coming
from
the
bottle
whenever
i
find
myself
in
a
bar
with
a
limited
tap
selection
this
isnt
such
a
bad
option
from
the
bottle
however
i
wont
buy
it
single
from
wf
cary
lots
of
carbonation
with
this
beer
the
taste
is
pretty
standard
lager
with
some
malty
complexity
you
dont
get
with
large
production
american
lager
beers
one
thing
ill
say
is
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
take
this
to
tailgate
the
finish
is
clean
and
helps
make
this
a
better
than
average
lager
d
over
all
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
does
fall
short
in
a
few
areas
but
it
has
a
decent
taste
thats
going
down
pretty
easy
right
now
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
super
light
copper
medium
clear
a
bright
tope
head
good
retention
and
lacing
a
mostly
dead
aroma
a
little
generic
sweetner
comes
through
a
little
medicinal
the
taste
is
generic
toffee
light
skunk
bad
rye
this
is
pretty
tough
to
drink
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
a
bit
on
the
dull
side
but
you
have
to
appreciate
red
oaks
commitment
to
the
reinheitsgebot
other
local
brewers
like
foothills
and
natty
greenes
dont
need
or
want
to
stick
to
strict
traditions
so
these
guys
are
the
ones
doing
it
in
the
triad
room
for
everybody
and
all
that
poured
out
with
a
deep
copper
color
good
silky
head
that
disappated
it
is
a
little
clody
and
the
carbonation
is
rapid
and
small
lovely
to
look
at
it
has
a
grainy
hint
on
the
nose
but
overall
clean
pretty
complex
on
the
palate
though
a
little
fruity
very
bready
and
a
slight
dry
hop
taste
that
it
buried
in
a
sea
of
malt
misses
being
a
dunkel
lager
by
a
bit
but
still
very
tasty
got
to
knock
it
for
not
hitting
the
style
right
needs
more
hop
balance
moderate
body
and
very
airy
burp
very
drinkable
however
good
for
fall
though
spring
not
much
head
and
pours
a
light
amber
color
the
first
sip
is
kind
of
strange
if
youve
never
had
it
before
with
an
oaknutty
flavor
to
it
in
the
after
taste
once
you
adjust
though
its
incredibly
refreshing
and
one
of
the
easiest
beers
ive
ever
had
to
drink
the
flavor
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
and
the
hints
of
oaknut
give
it
a
distinct
and
delicious
taste
id
suggest
the
draft
to
the
bottle
but
at
least
its
finally
available
in
bottles
now
and
theyre
still
very
good
the
color
is
a
deep
mahogany
reddish
brown
with
a
offwhite
head
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
aroma
of
malt
and
strong
barley
some
faint
alcohol
notes
taste
of
strong
malts
balanced
with
some
noble
hops
not
too
bitter
this
beer
is
all
about
balance
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
exceptional
drinkability
red
oak
was
the
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
gateway
beer
with
no
complexity
whatsoever
served
from
tap
into
an
imperial
pint
poured
an
amber
orange
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
that
subsides
slowly
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
evident
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
nutmeg
and
malt
the
flavor
was
earthy
and
nutty
with
a
big
nutty
followthrough
upon
swallowing
it
was
medium
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
that
is
really
refreshing
the
extremely
nutty
followthrough
is
a
bit
overwhelming
at
first
but
once
you
palate
adjusts
it
is
quite
enjoyable
d
tried
this
because
its
brewed
about
25
miles
away
will
definitely
be
having
a
lot
more
of
these
good
tasting
beer
did
not
disappoint
d
a
good
amber
lager
for
a
session
beer
i
would
imagine
it
would
be
perfect
for
an
early
fall
afternoon
as
the
flavors
mimic
earthy
tones
good
mellow
crispness
to
the
body
flavors
of
honeykissed
biscuits
some
caramel
and
a
good
bready
finish
bitterness
is
low
in
this
one
this
is
a
great
refreshing
beer
glad
i
can
have
this
one
in
the
fridge
more
often
now
not
a
bad
warm
weather
beer
if
you
like
them
on
the
sweet
side
a
little
stickysweet
for
me
but
it
looks
beautiful
in
the
glass
overall
one
of
my
favorites
ill
definitely
be
recommending
the
bottles
to
anyone
who
enjoys
red
oak
draft
drinkability
is
not
bad
overall
all
this
is
a
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
decent
flavor
it
would
make
a
pretty
good
session
beer
but
its
not
what
i
would
consider
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
still
not
bad
pretty
good
session
beer
that
i
would
have
repeatedly
but
i
would
definitely
recommend
a
more
solid
amber
if
someone
was
asking
i
could
and
did
drink
a
couple
of
tall
ones
jonathan
passow
d
well
i
guess
its
drinkable
this
beer
is
really
not
too
exciting
overall
though
no
head
bud
some
decent
lacing
a
warm
orange
color
not
much
of
an
aroma
to
speak
of
but
what
is
there
is
pleasant
slightly
bready
not
much
hop
character
on
the
flavor
and
overall
a
very
bready
flavor
dominates
just
like
the
aroma
that
being
said
the
flavor
is
mild
but
still
pleasant
its
nice
but
forgetable
its
extremely
popular
in
nc
and
i
never
knew
why
considering
its
fairly
expensive
in
a
lot
of
places
i
guess
it
has
a
massappeal
drinkability
while
still
have
the
appearance
of
a
legit
craft
beer
overall
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
the
whole
way
down
i
would
have
another
d
easily
drinkable
but
not
overly
complex
the
metallic
notes
take
some
away
found
it
on
tap
at
a
bar
in
the
airport
in
greensboro
on
my
way
back
from
a
business
trip
i
didnt
even
know
north
carolina
had
a
brewery
good
beer
living
in
north
carolina
i
hear
about
this
one
all
the
time
but
had
never
tried
it
until
last
night
glad
i
tried
it
good
price
too
3
a
pint
at
corbins
in
winston
this
will
be
a
beer
i
come
back
to
d
a
somewhat
simple
brew
but
not
difficult
to
drink
a
new
style
to
my
pallet
so
difficult
to
compare
to
a
pale
ale
for
example
light
brownamber
color
with
a
medium
head
had
it
on
tap
and
left
lots
of
lace
lightbodied
and
it
had
a
sour
malty
bitter
taste
to
it
not
all
that
great
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
but
beats
a
lot
of
other
crap
that
was
on
tap
bud
michelob
etc
this
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
enjoyed
it
on
tap
many
times
and
even
fresh
at
the
brewery
this
may
be
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
youll
ever
drink
its
red
color
with
a
little
cloudiness
is
good
to
look
at
it
pours
depending
on
where
you
get
it
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dissapears
quickly
great
refreshing
taste
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
slight
oaky
finish
again
the
smoothness
is
its
real
plus
you
could
drink
a
few
real
easy
served
a
crisp
dark
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
was
slight
caramel
malts
and
subtle
hops
taste
was
a
nice
balance
of
smooth
crisp
malts
and
undertoned
but
present
hops
the
beer
is
very
light
and
crisp
with
decent
carbonation
this
one
is
somewhat
enjoyable
one
thats
occasionally
available
around
nc
in
places
that
otherwise
dont
have
much
good
beer
if
you
are
in
nc
make
sure
you
check
it
out
d
i
didnt
have
a
problem
putting
back
a
pitcher
of
this
stuff
and
though
it
didnt
really
blow
me
away
it
was
a
decent
change
of
pace
this
is
a
pretty
good
amber
lager
its
unfiltered
and
has
a
nice
cloudy
amber
pour
with
a
small
head
it
tasted
of
mild
citrus
hops
well
balanced
with
mildly
sweet
bready
malts
its
an
enjoyable
everyday
brew
that
has
been
overshadowed
lately
by
the
explosive
growth
of
rival
natty
greenes
this
is
good
beer
it
has
a
sweet
smell
of
slight
fruittyness
with
the
added
aroma
of
hops
it
pours
an
amber
tone
that
makes
me
think
blah
though
it
doesnt
have
a
great
appearance
it
has
a
nice
taste
a
floral
blend
of
malt
and
hops
is
a
sure
pleaser
and
makes
it
easy
to
guzzle
down
a
few
of
these
beers
definetly
a
decent
beer
2
wednesday
afternoon
special
abbey
road
in
cary
nc
a
little
too
sweet
but
better
than
most
2
specials
that
i
have
hadim
looking
at
you
bud
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
was
at
the
red
oak
brew
pub
in
greensboro
nc
and
the
beer
tasted
like
turpentine
it
took
me
years
and
the
aforementioned
special
to
try
it
again
but
i
am
glad
to
report
that
the
chemical
taste
must
have
been
in
the
glassware
and
not
the
beer
the
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
great
either
ill
opt
for
a
glass
if
its
all
thats
available
but
its
by
no
means
one
of
my
favorites
likewise
their
other
main
offering
hummingbird
sic
is
very
passable
its
a
shame
considering
that
the
brewery
seems
to
pride
itself
on
being
unfiltered
and
unpasteurized
oh
well
thankfully
there
are
better
nc
breweries
to
choose
from
almost
an
orangeish
amber
with
a
big
offwhite
head
and
reasonable
lacing
the
smell
was
of
wheat
and
sour
mash
the
first
tangy
taste
brought
more
of
the
tart
sour
mash
flavor
with
some
citrus
and
maybe
fig
in
there
somehow
or
another
it
is
nicely
carbonated
pretty
refreshing
reasonably
drinkable
but
it
comes
down
to
this
tart
thing
with
a
dry
finish
that
doesnt
make
me
want
to
overdo
this
stuff
from
a
taste
standpoint
its
ok
worth
a
try
d
you
could
keep
drinking
this
all
day
but
would
you
really
want
to
this
came
from
the
tap
with
a
light
amber
pour
with
small
lacing
and
little
character
the
smell
was
bready
and
malty
but
unremarkable
an
easy
smooth
taste
with
light
malts
and
more
bready
flavor
but
nothing
remarkable
smooth
enough
to
drink
and
make
a
session
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
sadly
in
quite
a
few
places
in
greensboro
it
comes
down
to
this
and
a
sam
adams
take
the
sam
adams
drinks
very
easy
one
i
will
look
for
the
next
im
back
in
nc
one
of
the
better
bottom
fermented
beers
ive
lately
i
tried
this
beer
on
tap
at
mellow
mushroom
in
winstonsalem
nc
it
is
extremely
smooth
with
a
strong
honey
scenttaste
it
actually
reminded
me
a
lot
of
dogfish
heads
midas
touch
in
the
mouthfeel
and
aroma
the
menu
at
m
m
described
it
as
a
vienna
lager
and
since
that
is
said
to
be
the
best
style
of
beer
to
have
with
a
pizza
unfiltered

well
kindestcutjul
13
but
onlike
those
nc
the
beer
is
a
solid
amber
color
with
a
medium
light
beige
head
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
and
vinegar
medium
body
this
is
definitely
the
nonthreatning
appeal
beer
the
new
brewnmaster
is
cranking
it
up
a
notch
and
i
expect
good
things
down
the
road
lewwjr0
good
amber
color
smooth
taste
with
strong
lager
finish
nice
compliment
to
bud
stable
well
maybe
not
the
king
of
beers
refreshing
beer
tastes
great
solid
abv
can
drink
all
12
watery
and
slick
will
not
buy
again
this
is
a
good
beer
smooth
with
a
little
kick
throw
in
sal
y
and
a
lime
and
it
gives
it
that
extra
kick
needed
the
taste
of
the
black
crown
is
more
powerful
than
the
lime
which
is
good
in
its
own
since
also
this
somehow
will
get
you
tipsy
without
trying
i
love
this
beer
plenty
of
drunk
nights
with
this
bought
it
thinking
it
might
be
decent
but
it
was
just
typical
macro
watered
down
beer
last
time
ill
ever
pay
for
a
macro
much
better
than
the
original
and
any
other
macro
still
wouldnt
ever
drink
it
again
though
overall
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
and
certainly
not
the
worst
from
the
brewer
this
is
one
of
the
better
efforts
from
ab
do
not
taste
the
hint
of
caramel
they
refer
to
however
a
lot
lighter
than
i
originally
anticipated
it
to
be
i
would
drink
it
again
probably
my
favorite
budweiser
it
surprised
me
a
bit
one
of
the
better
beers
they
produce
really
nice
for
a
commercial
brew
consistent
and
much
more
flavor
than
you
would
expect
from
corporate
beer
mo
a
decent
enough
beer
that
doesnt
change
a
whole
lot
from
the
start
through
to
the
finish
it
is
a
beer
that
i
would
be
able
to
enjoy
during
a
session
as
its
thin
to
medium
bodied
very
smooth
the
carbonation
is
quite
fine
and
it
had
a
very
standard
yet
flavorful
enough
taste
i
would
buy
this
again
and
think
its
a
good
effort
and
think
it
is
getting
a
bad
reputation
overall
just
because
it
is
a
budweiser
product
overall
i
liked
this
less
and
less
as
i
continued
to
drink
it
it
had
hints
of
being
an
amber
lager
pours
a
yellowish
amber
white
frothy
head
with
quick
dissipation
nose
grainy
taste
bland
with
hints
of
sweet
corn
nastiness
not
as
repulsive
as
bud
lite
but
honestly
ill
take
the
blandness
of
bud
over
this
ones
attempts
at
character
overall
this
is
a
noticeable
step
above
standard
bud
and
other
aals
in
flavor
with
a
nice
boost
in
abv
to
go
with
it
i
wouldnt
turn
down
this
beer
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
but
would
not
buy
it
myself
the
worst
fault
is
the
lack
of
flavor
to
mask
the
somewhat
high
abv
making
it
a
little
unpleasant
to
drink
but
other
than
that
its
pretty
smooth
which
is
what
they
are
going
for
very
good
taste
and
pleasant
aroma
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
down
it
looks
very
good
in
the
glass
and
was
very
refreshing
after
a
round
of
golf
if
the
price
is
right
ill
get
it
again
for
these
circumstances
overall
an
ok
beer
if
the
place
you
are
at
has
a
limited
selection
there
are
many
worse
beers
out
there
muyton
dressed
as
lamb
save
your
money
o
a
step
above
buds
general
offerings
but
not
amazingly
flavorful
either
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
that
is
apparently
inspired
by
amber
lagers
not
nearly
as
flavorful
as
most
ambers
or
reds
that
i
have
had
though
35
by
far
one
of
the
better
beers
put
out
with
the
budweiser
label
not
the
best
but
it
is
ok
light
bodied
in
sum
four
ounces
in
count
me
out
not
undrinkable
but
id
have
to
be
parched
or
dying
of
thirst
to
have
this
one
again
funny
i
had
a
miller
high
life
not
long
ago
which
inspired
me
to
pick
this
up
it
wasnt
so
bad
end
game
sink
i
like
fortune
better
than
this
this
may
have
a
touch
of
age
on
it
with
an
apr
14
date
on
bottom
of
can
best
by
or
canning
date
either
way
i
dont
find
the
flavors
all
that
pleasing
putting
it
towards
the
bottom
of
lawn
mower
beers
for
me
overall
im
not
impressed
although
i
got
this
bottle
free
i
wonder
if
they
had
a
craft
beer
price
tag
on
this
one
but
the
thing
is
pretending
its
craft
doesnt
turn
a
bud
into
a
craft
beer
not
that
i
am
taking
anything
away
from
bud
its
not
easy
to
make
a
nearly
colorless
flavorless
crystal
clear
beer
but
thats
not
going
to
take
anything
away
from
the
craft
beer
market
either
craft
drinkers
will
see
right
through
and
go
back
to
what
they
really
want
when
they
seek
out
an
amber
ale
flavor
aroma
head
lacing
etc
which
this
really
doesnt
have
sinkability
i
couldnt
even
finish
this
sad
effort
o
while
not
a
bad
beer
its
not
a
really
good
one
either
definitely
a
step
up
from
regular
bud
though
i
think
of
a
malt
liquor
disguised
in
a
sleek
12oz
bottle
surprisingly
enjoyable
never
thought
id
dig
an
anheuser
busch
brew
not
a
fan
of
the
regular
budweiser
or
bud
light
but
somehow
the
brewmasters
at
anheuser
busch
created
something
i
could
enjoy
i
especially
like
the
fact
that
this
particular
brew
is
6
percent
alc
by
content
it
packs
a
descent
buzz
for
a
budweiser
now
i
know
why
it
was
on
sale
for
1
a
can
the
taste
also
has
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
to
it
and
that
budweiser
beechwood
roastiness
better
than
regular
budweiser
by
far
saw
this
at
my
local
cstore
and
decided
i
would
give
it
a
try
after
all
its
black
crown
so
it
must
taste
regal
right
wrong
if
i
had
to
describe
this
beer
it
would
be
3
parts
bud
2
parts
michelob
amber
bock
tastes
pretty
bad
and
leaves
a
twang
taste
on
your
tongue
after
your
done
michelob
amber
bock
isnt
the
greatest
but
it
deserves
a
crown
a
lot
more
than
this
crappy
beer
does
ill
stick
with
sam
adams
boston
ale
or
even
miller
genuine
draft
is
better
than
the
black
crown
i
think
the
hardest
thing
with
this
beer
was
the
expectations
its
called
black
crown
but
has
a
subtitle
of
golden
amber
lager
what
does
golden
amber
mean
and
why
give
it
the
black
crown
it
turns
out
the
budweiser
on
the
can
told
me
everything
i
needed
to
know
looks
and
tastes
like
any
other
bud
product
a
little
sweeter
than
most
not
a
bad
beer
if
youre
just
drinking
while
hanging
out
but
the
abv
is
a
little
high
for
that
what
this
beer
does
very
well
is
hide
the
somewhat
high
alcohol
content
which
could
be
trouble
if
youre
drinking
it
while
hanging
out
it
goes
down
easy
but
its
not
a
beer
youll
remember
and
it
could
lead
to
a
night
you
wont
remember
can
poured
a
light
brown
color
lager
with
a
medium
head
with
limited
retention
and
very
subtle
lacing
aroma
consists
of
light
cereal
with
grainy
caramel
malt
taste
is
also
dominated
by
grainy
cereal
notes
with
light
caramel
adjunct
notes
body
is
thin
with
ok
carbonation
worst
than
i
was
expecting
a
good
finger
of
head
on
a
clear
amber
colored
body
the
aroma
is
a
little
grain
with
some
fruit
the
beechwood
is
evident
too
smells
nice
the
taste
is
balanced
and
smooth
it
has
only
the
mildest
bitterness
to
go
with
its
malty
body
for
a
lager
the
texture
is
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
its
a
smooth
and
tasty
lager
not
sure
what
they
going
for
here
budweiser
black
crown
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
the
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
6
0
but
it
goes
down
real
smooth
the
smell
is
the
same
as
american
style
beer
the
taste
is
heavy
with
a
lot
of
flavor
this
brew
is
really
filling
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
over
all
i
give
this
beer
a
4
out
of
5
the
color
of
the
beer
is
awesome
very
nice
caramelesque
appearance
i
enjoyed
the
nose
pleasant
and
certainly
anything
but
overpowering
the
taste
was
great
this
beer
isnt
trying
to
do
too
much
its
solid
smooth
and
well
rounded
very
impressed
with
this
effort
notwithstanding
its
brethren
othis
has
more
taste
that
most
beers
from
the
big
brewers
enjoyed
it
im
glad
i
just
had
a
sampler
and
didnt
buy
a
6
pack
it
was
all
right
didnt
care
for
the
alcohol
in
the
aroma
disappointing
immediately
concluded
the
beverage
was
just
another
attempt
by
a
giant
producer
to
raise
the
apv
and
gain
or
maintain
market
share
that
way
budweiser
a
true
american
icon
needs
to
lead
the
way
not
follow
the
crowd
unlike
plain
old
bud
which
has
many
distinctive
characteristics
black
crown
has
none
other
than
its
me
too
persona
really
disappointed
i
expected
much
more
if
you
want
a
cheap
decent
abv
amber
lager
and
arent
looking
for
anything
fancy
you
might
just
enjoy
it
overall
better
than
most
bmc
i
will
say
this
about
abinbev
beers
they
never
lack
for
carbonation
and
effervescence
i
started
out
with
a
fingerandahalf
of
foamy
french
vanillacolored
head
and
it
slowly
fizzled
down
to
less
than
a
pinkys
worth
color
and
clarity
were
both
fabulous
with
a
deepamber
like
you
might
see
prehistoric
bugs
encased
in
and
the
opportunity
to
see
all
that
there
was
to
see
which
in
this
case
was
the
other
side
of
the
glass
the
other
side
of
the
room
et
al
i
saw
where
previous
reviewers
mentioned
its
smell
and
it
was
nice
to
be
sure
it
had
a
lightly
toasted
smell
sweet
but
not
necessarily
caramel
more
toward
coconut
mouthfeel
was
soft
especially
after
all
of
the
initial
carbonation
the
taste
was
toasty
bready
not
really
even
all
that
sweet
finish
was
semidry
and
refreshing
it
really
was
not
a
bad
effort
although
not
a
masterpiece
if
they
put
it
in
a
can
i
would
be
willing
to
try
it
again
but
otherwise
it
is
one
among
many
of
its
style
appearance
was
surprisingly
disappointing
because
normally
you
would
expect
and
receive
a
good
head
on
any
beer
from
a
large
brewery
like
this
not
much
here
and
it
fades
fast
nose
is
also
a
bit
muted
with
some
light
grain
aromas
palate
has
a
very
light
malty
taste
whiff
of
alcohol
heat
and
not
much
else
going
on
not
as
extremely
light
bodied
as
i
was
expecting
and
yet
it
is
fairly
drinkable
just
doesnt
come
across
at
all
as
any
sort
of
flavorfocused
beer
im
a
longtime
bud
fan
and
recently
tried
this
variation
first
bottle
i
thought
its
ok
and
most
of
the
time
it
tastes
like
piss
water
but
of
course

its
decent
for
an
aal
mediocre
and
boring
admittedly
a
proper
representative
of
the
style
had
last
year
dont
know
why
i
didnt
review
then
better
than
i
remembered
j
o
not
a
bad
genny
offering
o
the
lighter
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
rather
sessionable
great
aroma
but
a
strange
buttery
and
tart
taste
it
definitely
mellowed
out
as
it
warmed
when
the
malt
really
came
out
o
well
rounded
easy
drinking
with
loads
of
complimentary
flavors
one
of
my
favorite
irish
reds
so
far
will
definitely
revisit
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
ones
in
the
style
overall
nothing
spectacular
nothing
bad
just
a
good
red
lager
to
throw
back
on
st
patricks
day
ive
had
a
few
dundee
seasonals
and
theyre
all
pretty
decent
add
this
one
to
the
list
not
perfect
but
good
for
a
saturday
afternoon
celebration
not
bad
i
got
this
brew
in
a
pick
6
as
for
irish
red
very
basic
the
smell
was
what
to
expect
of
malts
but
they
were
very
light
on
the
nose
the
taste
pretty
much
the
same
not
quite
there
mouthfeel
not
bad
nice
for
its
style
o
this
is
an
okay
lager
i
could
see
it
being
a
gateway
beer
for
a
noncraft
drinker
other
very
temperature
sensitive
had
one
that
was
just
a
bit
too
cold
and
it
totally
killed
the
flavor
and
aromas
the
beer
was
very
disappointing
the
malt
goes
away
and
because
there
hops
and
other
flavors
are
fairly
mild
youre
not
left
with
much
had
a
second
a
bit
warmer
in
the
5055
degree
range
and
it
was
a
night
and
day
difference
it
went
form
boy
do
i
have
to
drink
this
whole
thing
to
hey
this
is
pretty
tasty
overall
an
excellent
choice
for
its
genre
only
have
tried
two
beers
from
this
brewery
but
so
far
they
seem
solid
amber
in
body
with
big
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
lacing
aroma
of
cereal
big
malt
sweetness
nutty
hazelnut
comes
to
mind
tastes
is
big
on
cereal
grains
nuts
slight
hop
spice
echoes
of
apple
skins
toasted
bread
clean
finish
with
just
a
lingering
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
session
with
a
malt
focus
as
long
as
dundee
is
on
the
shelves
i
will
continue
buying
it
overall
interesting
brew
somewhat
of
a
new
taste
for
me
perhaps
due
to
the
style
good
tasting
and
somewhat
different
an
overall
ok
brew
that
i
enjoyed
not
the
best
representation
of
this
style
that
ive
had
but
enjoyable
all
the
same
pours
more
of
an
goldenorange
color
than
a
red
an
offwhite
ring
is
there
smell
is
mainly
mineral
as
well
as
some
earthy
malts
at
first
taste
im
surprised
how
roasty
and
almost
peaty
one
of
the
malts
is
its
very
nice
an
overriding
smoothness
follows
an
almost
smoky
finish
yet
still
a
bit
bitter
probably
the
most
complex
brew
ive
yet
tried
from
dundee
and
i
liked
it
dundee
irish
red
lager
is
a
very
clear
amber
beer
the
thin
foamy
off
white
head
thins
to
a
film
and
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
an
aroma
of
funky
genesee
yeast
and
some
sweet
caramel
its
pretty
light
bodied
and
a
little
watery
with
a
slightly
gritty
finish
it
tastes
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
salty
it
reminds
me
of
genny
bock
theres
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
a
little
toastiness
maybe
nuttiness
theres
a
tiny
hint
of
herbal
bitterness
at
the
finish
is
this
genny
bock
overall
although
not
an
expert
opinion
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
something
like
yuenglings
traditional
lager
i
would
choose
this
beer
yuenglings
standard
lager
is
definitely
drinkable
but
so
is
this
as
well
i
feel
dundee
irish
red
lager
has
a
more
full
taste
than
the
former
pours
a
brilliant
reddishcoffee
and
has
similar
aromas
of
light
roast
coffee
caramel
and
baked
apricot
the
palate
is
hugely
malty
and
juicy
with
a
tart
presentation
and
a
balancing
but
never
overpowering
hoppiness
more
notes
of
espresso
and
papaya
lead
to
the
mouthwatering
finish
this
taste
clean
and
fresh
but
unlike
honey
brown
witch
backs
it
up
with
it
name
and
taste
this
beer
doesnt
bring
anything
to
the
table
doesnt
even
look
red
has
no
taste
skip
it
waste
of
time
but
it
cheap
and
if
your
a
poor
white
boy
looking
to
waste
your
money
then
buy
this
beer
why
is
it
call
irish
that
an
insult
d
theres
really
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
its
just
not
doing
it
for
me
i
could
down
several
of
these
and
they
would
go
with
just
about
anything
its
a
nice
mild
beer
drinkability
to
be
honest
i
find
dundee
gives
a
banal
treatment
to
their
range
of
brews
but
i
genuinely
enjoyed
this
one
and
its
the
only
id
consider
purchasing
again
dont
hold
me
to
it
though
maybe
im
just
getting
soft
and
sweet
in
my
old
age
d
bought
this
on
a
whim
since
it
was
only
2
dollars
for
the
single
and
it
was
well
worth
the
try
kind
of
wish
i
had
this
in
a
variety
pack
with
the
winter
and
the
honey
brown
i
would
buy
it
since
it
would
be
under
30
for
the
variety
d
would
drink
a
few
of
these
and
would
be
really
good
at
a
cookout
would
go
good
with
a
smokey
grilled
taste
served
chilled
in
a
sam
adams
lager
class
decent
foam
color
was
more
of
an
amber
than
a
red
but
adequate
although
the
label
said
something
about
extra
malt
this
reminded
me
of
a
watereddown
version
of
ale
asylums
hopalicious
this
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
to
consume
in
quantities
and
with
food
as
it
would
neither
fill
you
up
nor
fight
the
taste
of
foods
i
still
have
one
bottle
left
which
i
will
have
to
try
with
a
meal
as
far
as
red
lagers
go
it
finishes
just
a
touch
heavy
but
id
still
recommend
it
over
the
macrobrewed
attempt
made
by
the
coors
empire
killians
irish
red
at
least
dundees
take
on
irish
lager
has
some
staying
power
and
for
than
i
commend
them
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
pale
and
caramel
scent
along
with
a
dry
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
bone
dry
pale
and
crystal
malt
flavor
it
has
a
mild
caramel
character
as
well
as
a
pretty
good
hop
component
it
goes
down
smooth
with
some
metallic
offflavors
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
red
ale
im
not
exactly
lovin
the
taste
its
a
little
too
dry
for
me
dundeegenesee
beer
ranges
from
slightly
below
average
to
slightly
above
average
irish
red
lager
is
on
the
low
end
of
that
range
and
isnt
something
that
i
care
to
drink
again
even
as
a
starter
ira
there
are
better
options
than
this
d
not
a
bad
offering
from
dundee
it
could
use
a
little
work
but
its
on
the
right
track
to
becoming
a
good
irish
red
i
do
like
the
cleanliness
of
the
beer
though
a
bit
harsh
on
the
finish
for
a
lager
pours
with
a

drinkability
overall
is
pretty
weak
due
to
the
fact
that
the
flavor
good
be
much
better
and
its
just
not
drinking
as
smooth
as
an
irish
red
should
do
you
remember
michael
sheas
irish
lager
they
used
to
brew
this
is
pretty
close
to
that
overall
a
clean
finishing
easy
drinking
red
nothing
to
blow
you
away
here
a
decent
affordable
brew
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
goldreddish
color
not
quite
amber
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
taste
is
also
basically
of
malts
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
very
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fine
quality
beer
very
drinkable
i
bought
this
at
my
local
quick
6
after
they
offered
a
free
sample
will
def
suggest
to
others
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
sensible
offering
for
a
sensible
price
i
def
see
myself
getting
more
of
this
for
the
season
well
this
is
the
best
that
genny
has
come
up
with
id
drink
this
again
with
pleasure
bravo
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
and
drinkable
red
unique
beer
i
wasnt
accustomed
to
to
a
of
coronation
and
head
sweet
but
stout
ill
drink
this
will
im
eating
bbq
but
that
would
be
about
it
one
of
the
worst
beers
ever
im
a
big
fan
of
this
very
disappointed
this
is
my
goto
session
beer
just
a
nice
taste
that
goes
down
easy
pretty
disappointing
i
expected
a
sweeter
newcastle
however
this
was
not
the
case
poured
a
very
light
bronze
with
white
head
that
didnt
last
smell
was
sweet
malt
maybe
some
corn
taste
was
very
sweet
with
a
bit
of
honey
and
a
weird
after
flavor
that
i
couldnt
quite
place
overall
a
very
thin
sweet
beer
that
i
would
pass
on
again
honestly
it
tasted
like
bud
light
with
a
splash
of
honey
disappointing
has
a
tinge
of
honey
at
the
end
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
anytime
beer
you
cannot
beat
the
price
i
love
honey
beers
and
this
is
my
favorite
drinkability
i
really
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
there
are
soooo
many
better
drews
heavy
and
sweet
but
goes
down
very
easy
o
this
is
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
very
light
but
refreshing
i
have
no
doubt
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
barbecues
or
with
burgers
very
good
for
a
massproduced
domestic
beer
overall
rating
this
beer
was
odd
because
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
it
just
wasnt
a
good
beer
it
was
ok
nothing
really
stands
out
overall
kind
of
meh
not
big
on
flavor
honey
brown
is
one
of
the
original
beers
of
rochester
and
unless
you
drink
the
genny
stuff
this
is
really
the
original
craft
offering
of
the
city
i
still
like
it
as
much
as
i
ever
have
its
distinct
a
little
pale
in
color
to
be
considered
a
brown
in
my
book
more
copper
and
very
clear
the
nose
shows
a
little
honey
sweetness
but
most
of
that
is
fermented
out
and
leaving
only
the
pollen
honey
flavor
lots
of
malt
middle
too
with
more
of
an
amber
sweetness
than
a
honey
one
malty
like
an
esb
almost
less
roast
and
chocolate
malt
than
i
usually
expect
from
a
brown
but
there
is
a
sight
darker
malt
element
which
i
guess
can
get
it
there
for
those
not
used
to
bigger
darker
richer
browns
the
fact
that
its
lagered
makes
it
awesome
i
think
drinks
lighter
finishes
quickly
and
lets
the
flavors
sort
of
come
back
one
by
one
after
the
swallow
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
brew
good
craft
to
drink
a
lot
of
and
even
right
from
the
bottle
feels
appropriate
nice
carbonation
and
not
the
least
bit
filling
the
original
and
best
from
dundee
o
not
bad
i
like
the
addition
of
the
honey
you
could
do
worse
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
balanced
honey
brown
has
a
sweet
malt
flavor
with
seemingly
no
hops
to
taste
you
get
a
sweet
malt
flavor
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
with
a
pleasant
mild
honey
aftertaste
the
two
different
sweet
characteristics
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
an
excellent
choice
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
night
since
there
is
no
bitterness
to
this
beer
it
is
an
excellent
recommendation
to
friends
who
are
used
to
drinking
typical
american
lagers
overall
a
lager
i
was
pleased
with
i
would
buy
these
for
those
warm
summer
days
very
easy
drinking
and
has
a
pleasant
sweet
taste
about
it
which
makes
it
quite
agreeable
im
not
a
lager
guy
but
this
beer
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
refreshing
a
good
everyday
beer
the
appearance
is
a
little
thin
for
a
brown
but
the
smell
and
taste
were
both
pretty
good
mostly
earth
and
nut
tones
from
the
smell
but
most
of
what
you
get
in
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
of
floral
tastes
from
the
hop
and
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
as
well
although
it
was
thinner
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
its
not
complicated
doesnt
have
a
real
wow
factor
but
overall
not
bad
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
tried
it
it
is
certainly
not
a
world
class
beer
but
it
is
perfectly
fine
for
what
it
is
a
clean
refreshing
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
just
a
bit
too
watered
down
i
was
disappointed
even
without
high
hopes
overall
this
brew
is
great
by
my
accounts
99
cents
a
24
oz
a
honey
dominate
brew
but
well
balanced
malts
are
well
hidden
i
would
buy
this
again
price
is
right
and
so
is
the
taste
if
you
like
honey
you
can
pick
up
a
12
pack
of
24
ozs
for
just
over
12
thats
24
beers
for
a
shade
over
12
bucks
deal
honey
brown
lager
is
a
nice
light
brown
color
smell
there
is
not
much
there
taste
is
smooth
and
rich
over
all
it
is
a
good
drinkable
brew
like
i
said
goes
down
smooth
it
is
a
full
beer
this
a
brew
that
i
will
be
buying
to
change
it
up
for
the
main
steam
brews
on
the
market
pours
a
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
at
all
with
really
no
lacing
to
speak
of
average
carbonation
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
malt
and
yeast
with
honey
brown
sugar
the
taste
was
about
the
same
with
a
hint
of
caramel
no
bitter
aftertaste
overall
it
was
very
decent
othis
is
a
pretty
macrotype
beer
even
if
it
does
offer
hints
of
honey
to
set
it
apart
from
the
bmc
standards
the
biggest
problem
for
me
is
that
the
honey
is
a
bit
artificial
tasting
which
doesnt
do
much
to
cover
up
the
grainy
base
beer
oh
well
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
picked
this
up
because
it
looked
like
a
good
deal
for
a
beer
id
never
tried
before
its
a
perfectly
decent
drink
nothing
splendid
but
for
the
price
i
didnt
expect
anything
more
than
perfectly
decent
id
buy
it
again
but
without
any
especially
great
enthusiasm
leftover
from
a
party
on
the
11th
not
good
previous
notes
from
2007
indicate
i
judged
this
to
be
a
bad
beer
i
still
agree
despite
the
technical
rating
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
beer
out
again
when
i
gain
a
little
more
knowledge
about
beers
o
not
bad
and
certainly
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
10
for
a
12
case
isnt
a
bad
price
but
it
could
be
cheaper
for
the
quality
it
has
been
awhile
since
i
had
this
one
i
have
fond
memories
of
it
pours
a
beautiful
golden
brown
smells
of
honeysuckle
the
mouthful
is
like
chewing
toffee
candy
this
is
one
of
the
two
honey
beers
where
you
can
actually
taste
the
honey
taste
is
sweet
malty
definitely
satisfies
the
sweet
tooth
very
drinkable
beer
i
am
rating
it
higher
than
most
but
i
like
it
o
you
can
definitely
smell
and
taste
the
honey
in
this
beer
which
prevents
it
from
being
bland
a
little
light
on
the
taste
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
price
not
a
lot
of
complexity
and
low
on
alcohol
content
but
what
do
you
expect
at
19
a
case
my
favorite
bargin
lager
so
far
pours
a
deep
copper
color
aroma
of
sweet
malt
honey
and
spent
grains
in
the
taste
honey
malts
bread
and
very
little
hop
or
bitterness
smooth
lager
with
notes
of
caramel
and
honey
toast
caramel
hop
and
a
bit
of
corn
smooth
lager
with
a
mild
honey
taste
medium
bodied
feel
with
a
honey
slick
finish
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
quite
drinkable
overall
this
is
still
a
good
beer
i
made
myself
famous
in
college
by
throwing
keg
parties
with
this
stuff
let
the
good
times
roll
with
this
one
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
will
buy
more
a
very
enjoyable
drinking
experience
overall
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
know
ive
had
this
beer
in
the
past
but
didnt
sit
down
to
think
about
it
in
depth
overall
full
disclosure
i
am
a
fan
of
this
because
of
its
pricing
and
overall
taste
this
is
the
kind
of
brew
you
start
drinking
at
100
p
m
on
a
sunday
and
are
still
enjoying
in
early
evening
the
alcohol
does
not
overwhelm
but
the
beverage
remains
highly
drinkable
a
true
session
beer
offering
from
new
york
state
this
beer
pairs
with
alot
of
barfood
and
is
equally
enjoyable
on
its
own
it
has
a
unique
flavor
and
is
consistently
enjoyable
share
with
friends
after
work
while
watching
a
game
or
while
relaxing
on
the
patio
by
yourself
add
a
few
bottles
to
your
refrigerator
so
you
have
a
fallback
when
guests
dont
appreciate
the
highend
stuff
this
is
appealing
to
beersnobs
as
well
as
beerilliterates
not
a
great
beer
but
enjoyable
this
is
my
standby
for
something
cheap
but
quaffable
also
good
for
cooking
brats
and
sausages
for
the
price
its
a
great
choice
for
something
that
tastes
reasonably
good
without
the
craft
price
tag
id
agree
as
well
that
its
a
steppingstone
to
greater
things
but
it
is
great
for
times
that
you
want
something
decent
without
exhausting
your
supply
of
quality
brews
half
finger
head
that
fades
instantly
amber
red
color
almost
no
smell
syrupy
bland
taste
goes
down
smooth
goes
down
like
rootbeer
barely
and
carbonation
makes
it
taste
thick
it
almost
leaves
no
aftertaste
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
fits
the
american
amber
category
well
in
some
ways
a
bit
too
sticky
for
me
and
the
hops
were
noble
not
citrusypiney
american
judged
to
style
not
my
flavor
preference
overall
this
beer
is
decent
even
with
the
nostalgia
in
my
heart
and
palate
it
is
not
as
good
as
i
remember
however
i
have
offered
this
beer
to
many
a
women
and
they
really
like
it
which
is
good
for
all
you
craft
drinking
men
out
there
i
would
only
recommend
this
to
people
experimenting
in
beers
so
they
can
acquire
a
taste
for
something
a
bit
more
than
the
typical
american
adjunct
lager
overall
shiner
bock
is
not
easy
to
get
where
i
live
so
this
can
be
a
more
affordable
substitute
and
though
the
flavor
doesnt
match
shiner
its
not
as
noticeable
if
you
dont
compare
them
together
like
i
did
its
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
slight
sweet
darker
taste
than
any
of
your
macros
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
produced
an
average
head
with
average
retention
and
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
grain
and
honey
light
in
body
easy
to
drink
base
of
barley
malt
slight
hop
flavor
beer
is
thin
not
much
of
a
honey
flavor
however
the
beer
is
very
sweet
out
of
balance
in
my
opinion
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
cult
beer
o
a
very
mediocre
lager
but
then
i
was
not
expecting
much
the
honey
flavor
is
very
subtle
and
the
beer
is
poorly
balanced
not
entirely
unappealing
but
i
doubt
i
would
ever
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
again
enjoyed
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
enjoyable
mouthfeel
easy
to
go
down
and
great
smell
of
roasted
malts
it
was
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
bitter
you
can
expect
the
perfect
balance
between
the
two
this
is
the
perfect
dessert
beer
and
also
a
great
refreshing
treat
after
a
hard
day
of
tending
to
the
lawn
in
the
hot
summer
sun
however
it
does
taste
a
little
watered
down
definitely
could
use
some
more
hops
to
it
the
yeast
flavors
are
lacking
in
this
one
if
you
like
yeasty
beers
but
would
definitely
try
again
if
caught
on
sale
o
watery
amber
beer
with
little
flavour
and
a
slightly
above
average
bottle
and
name
not
worth
the
price
i
paid
in
china
45yuan
for
this
import
only
like
that
its
from
upstate
ny
o
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
i
found
it
to
lack
a
lot
of
flavor
and
the
metallic
scent
was
a
turnoff
i
would
not
recommend
the
beer
not
looking
forward
to
the
other
5
clear
medium
amber
color
not
much
nose
that
i
can
detect
where
do
tasters
come
up
with
all
these
descriptions
head
vanishes
quickly
leaving
no
traces
mouth
feel
is
smooth
flavor
is
good
but
a
bit
sweet
more
malt
than
hops
in
fact
i
can
barely
taste
hops
overall
not
bad
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
at
the
store
but
id
choose
it
in
a
restaurant
if
they
didnt
have
anything
more
interesting
a
pours
with
little
lacing
and
is
transparent
light
amber
s
honey
with
light
wheat
t
sweet
honey
front
transitioning
to
light
caramel
taste
finishes
quickly
with
little
aftertaste
mouth
feel
is
watery
and
light
overall
not
bad
for
the
style
but
the
beer
lacks
depth
complexity
and
individuality
my
goto
cheap
beer
theyve
got
this
at
every
store
and
every
bar
around
here
and
its
always
super
cheap
and
tastes
way
better
than
anything
else
for
the
same
price
pours
a
brown
color
with
offwhite
head
malty
taste
with
a
hint
of
honey
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
low
budget
light
amber
and
completely
transparent
sodalike
head
with
no
retention
or
lacing
bread
and
rice
aroma
adjunct
flavor
with
some
wheat
flavor
hint
of
honey
sweet
character
overall
light
body
and
highly
carbonated
lack
luster
wont
be
having
another
o
overall
this
beer
is
way
too
artificial
its
like
a
tootsie
roll
soaked
in
alcohol
i
didnt
even
finish
the
glass
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
bready
up
front
light
toasted
malts
some
honey
slight
hint
of
corn
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
towards
the
end
light
bodied
dry
lingering
aftertaste
this
beer
is
pretty
unspectacular
if
i
had
to
use
one
word
for
it
that
word
would
be
sweet
it
has
a
very
subtle
sweet
and
honestly
not
unpleasant
smell
it
pours
a
nice
full
golden
amber
with
a
1
inch
or
so
head
and
not
much
lacing
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
the
aftertaste
is
just
more
sweet
without
a
lot
of
hoppiness
not
horrible
at
all
but
not
spectacular
either
the
flavors
were
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
added
surprise
of
just
a
slight
bit
of
a
hop
tang
on
the
finish
nothing
really
notable
or
terrible
the
body
was
just
middleofthe
road
between
light
and
medium
drinkability
was
good
enough
if
youre
stuck
at
an
event
wedding
graduation
etc
and
the
choice
is
between
this
and
the
basic
bmcstyle
offerings
youll
be
pretty
happy
old
dundee
is
around
a
decent
for
what
it
is
and
hell
a
24oz
can
for
under
2
aint
no
bad
thing
this
brew
brings
back
memories
i
dont
think
ive
had
honey
brown
since
i
was
in
college
more
than
15
years
ago
24
ounce
tall
boy
can
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
goldamber
color
with
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
average
the
aroma
isnt
bad
at
all
but
its
very
light
it
smells
like
sweet
and
grainy
malt
and
some
honey
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
much
stronger
it
tastes
like
sweetgrainy
malt
honey
and
a
bit
of
caramel
very
sweet
tasting
beer
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
smooth
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
it
really
isnt
too
bad
at
all
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
bottle
or
can
of
this
hayward
abbey
rating
76
o
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
i
found
it
a
little
too
sweet
and
having
a
lot
of
toasted
and
burnt
malts
not
something
id
probably
seek
out
again
this
is
an
awesome
session
beer
its
thirst
quenching
and
still
flavorful
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
a
macro
drinker
could
easily
like
this
beer
right
away
either
way
a
good
one
to
keep
on
hand
or
pick
up
anywhere
really
since
its
common
one
of
my
more
preferred
beers
from
genesee
o
a
dull
and
kind
of
low
quality
malt
lager
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
a
free
one
were
handed
to
me
but
i
would
never
buy
this
either
o
kind
of
average
lager
nothing
really
stands
out
or
puts
it
ahead
of
the
rest
would
love
to
try
it
in
a
can
or
on
tap
to
compare
rjt
o
the
sweetness
is
a
turn
off
it
does
go
down
like
water
though
pours
light
caramel
brown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
finger
length
white
head
the
aromas
are
of
sweet
malt
and
honey
but
its
not
an
intense
aroma
its
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
the
honey
flavor
is
present
as
well
as
some
breadiness
from
the
malt
its
a
slightly
sweeter
macro
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
its
well
carbonated
so
it
drinks
fairly
easily
this
is
average
and
easy
to
drink
if
youre
looking
for
something
macro
but
slightly
different
this
would
be
fine
o
hey
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
i
got
this
for
free
its
no
hopslam
or
breakfast
stout
but
hell
ill
drink
it
by
weeks
end
cheers
o
this
used
to
be
so
good
but
turns
out
to
be
just
an
average
beer
overall
this
is
the
only
honey
type
beer
ive
ever
tried
but
its
pretty
good
a
little
too
sweet
but
not
bad
one
of
my
favorites
back
in
college
when
i
thought
i
was
sophisticated
definitely
a
gateway
brew
for
me
this
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
nice
white
foam
on
top
the
aroma
is
sweet
honey
a
little
staleness
roasted
grains
the
flavor
has
strong
undertones
of
honey
sweetness
behind
some
roasted
grain
and
not
much
bitter
to
balance
the
honey
leaves
a
strange
aftertaste
to
this
pretty
standard
lager
a
good
changeup
if
you
normally
drink
bud
but
i
tend
to
avoid
this
one
these
days
as
the
finish
isnt
as
pleasant
as
i
would
like
its
a
really
good
beer
you
can
taste
the
honey
not
what
i
expected
when
poured
out
didnt
really
grab
my
attention
with
the
color
not
as
amber
as
hoped
the
taste
is
the
beer
is
great
it
is
very
easy
drinking
with
not
noticeable
mouthfeel
overall
it
worth
a
b
o
pretty
much
mediocre
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
this
one
again
any
time
soon
it
pours
a
dark
and
slightly
reddish
hue
with
i
light
tan
colored
head
it
has
a
somewhat
sweet
taste
and
a
roasty
flavor
but
mellow
the
appearance

nothing
excitinglight

better
a
sweet

malty
odorreally
couldnt
pick
up
on
any
hop
the
taste
was
a
lot
like
the
odor
very
easy
to
drinkmaybe
too
easy
no
bite
or
real
sense
of
hittin
the
spot
this
to
me
is
a
beer
to
drink
in
the
same
situation
as
a
coors
or
bud
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
i
like
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
this
is
a
beer
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
of
so
i
wondered
if
i
would
enjoy
it
again
years
later
the
taste
is
mostly
caramel
with
a
light
sweet
smooth
tinge
and
gentle
diacetyl
from
the
lager
which
isnt
unpleasant
this
has
a
hint
of
creamy
caramel
but
finish
is
semidry
and
light
overall
i
enjoyed
this
not
a
great
lager
in
any
sense
but
serves
its
purpose
gentle
sweet
honey
adds
to
the
lager
it
is
probably
one
i
will
not
return
to
unless
the
beer
menu
is
similar
to
the
place
i
ordered
this
in
drinkability
i
try
to
leave
prejudice
out
of
my
reviews
but
in
full
disclosure
this
was
the
beer
i
probably
drunk
the
most
of
in
my
later
years
in
college
and
my
first
years
out
out
of
it
now
i
only
have
it
every
now
and
then
still
it
is
sentimental
and
is
a
favorite
i
love
the
sweetness
and
refreshingness
of
this
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
of
theseif
not
more
of
all
the
dundees
beers
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
i
think
it
drinks
more
like
a
sweet
brown
if
you
like
sweeter
beers
hunt
this
down
the
honey
is
about
as
present
here
as
it
is
in
any
beer
aroma
sweet
malts
floral
appearance
is
a
coppery
light
brown
with
fairly
large
white
head
the
head
dissapears
in
seconds
there
is
no
lacing
the
taste
is
horrid
overly
sweet
adjunct
lager
with
brown
food
coloring
nasty
nastynasty
o
not
really
my
style
only
reason
i
was
able
to
try
this
was
because
my
wife
bought
some
i
would
not
buy
this
for
myself
but
my
old
lady
seems
to
enjoy
them
o
a
decent
amber
but
rather
plain
and
a
little
too
malty
for
my
taste
just
a
very
basic
brew
onedimensional
but
not
bad
o
nicely
and
happily
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
this
its
not
bad
at
all
for
cheap
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
since
the
abv
is
so
low
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
thing
to
down
a
12
pack
very
happy
with
my
choice
dvery
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
beer
you
cant
beat
the
price
either
99
for
a
24
oz
can
a
great
choice
for
a
backyard
bbq
sort
of
event
o
might
try
to
cook
with
this
one
pours
a
weird
colour
for
a
so
called
honey
brown
its
more
like
a
clear
see
through
golden
amber
hue
which
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
and
a
rim
of
lacingi
found
the
smell
of
honey
more
prominant
when
smelling
the
bottle
but
when
poured
the
aromas
are
creaming
sodaa
touch
of
honeyfloral
hops
and
sweet
barleyit
has
a
just
over
light
bodied
mouthfeel
and
is
very
smooth
and
has
tastes
of
toffeehoneya
touch
of
floral
hopsbarley
sugar
and
finished
with
a
caramel
sweetness
and
overall
i
really
was
hoping
for
more
cheers
poured
a
1
5
white
head
clear
light
sienna
brown
iced
tead
colored
body
smell
is
mildy
sweet
with
caramel
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
label
says
this
is
extra
rich
no
is
it
lager
yes
i
get
some
of
the
crispness
in
the
finish
is
it
sweet
as
honey
no
not
really
just
a
tiny
step
up
from
bmc
mainstream
overall
meh
it
is
what
it
is
the
price
point
is
a
direct
indicator
of
what
youre
getting
o
decent
honey
brown
lager
very
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
better
than
a
watered
down
mass
produced
beer
but
not
an
over
thetop
craft
beer
and
it
looks
like
that
is
what
they
were
going
for
nothing
too
amazing
but
a
nice
flavorful
brew
pours
a
dark
gold
with
14
of
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
lacing
smells
of
grains
and
lager
yeast
with
just
a
hint
of
honey
taste
is
sweet
grains
up
front
and
honey
in
the
finish
the
honey
doesnt
over
power
but
is
actually
mixed
well
with
an
average
lager
mouthfeel
is
crisp
though
a
little
over
carbonated
pours
a
golden
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
has
good
carbonation
decent
lacing
and
minimal
retention
the
nose
consists
of
sweet
malts
and
not
much
else
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
sweet
honey
flavored
syrupy
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
grains
the
label
says
brewed
with
honey
but
i
cant
taste
a
good
quality
honey
in
this
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
very
watery
and
overall
this
is
just
an
average
sweet
tasting
american
lager
amazing
that
ten
years
ago
when
i
was
drinking
labatt
bud
bud
light
dos
equis
and
smithwick
that
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
mr
dundee
most
likely
is
sighing
in
his
grave
o
its
just
ok
poured
clear
and
with
a
nice
amberlight
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
nose
was
strong
with
caramel
and
a
general
fruity
sweetness
the
taste
was
filled
with
a
caramel
and
honey
sweetness
what
was
not
at
all
overpowering
as
the
glass
progressed
that
honey
started
to
come
out
of
the
background
a
little
more
but
this
remained
a
sweet
refreshing
drink
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
ever
drank
i
hated
it
at
the
time
i
actually
thought
it
was
bitter
coming
back
to
it
many
years
and
many
beers
later
im
struck
by
how
times
and
tastes
change
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
a
good
one
i
could
session
it
easily
a
good
one
to
have
from
time
to
time
and
its
hard
to
beat
the
price
this
beer
is
cheaper
in
the
big
24
oz
cans
than
in
the
6
pack
where
i
shop
i
drink
the
cans
multiple
times
per
week
its
the
best
beer
anywhere
near
its
price
range
about
1
50
for
a
24
oz
can
the
bottom
line
i
paid
a
dollar
for
this
24
oz
can
and
thats
a
damn
good
price
for
what
you
get
but
i
always
try
to
push
price
aside
when
reviewing
a
beer
and
focus
on
quality
as
far
as
quality
goes
for
this
beer
its
decent
give
it
a
try
you
might
enjoy
it
much
love
pretty
good
but
this
one
comes
with
a
warning
it
has
some
nice
sweet
undertones
which
make
it
easy
to
toss
back
although
it
has
a
light
abv
compared
to
other
sweeter
beers
like
brown
sugah
refreshing
tasty
and
delicious
honey
brown
pours
out
as
a
light
brown
lager
similar
to
what
a
newcastle
looks
like
the
head
is
thin
and
fizzy
the
smell
is
lightly
toasted
the
taste
is
kind
of
bland
now
these
days
it
used
to
be
a
nice
roasted
sweetness
that
was
pretty
easing
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
overall
i
thought
it
used
to
be
better
but
i
guess
my
tastes
changed
overall
a
pretty
measly
attempt
to
seem
like
a
craft
beer
when
its
nothing
but
an
unimpressive
notverypleasant
macro
lager
with
sweetener
in
it
poured
from
the
bottle
with
a
promising
head
which
soon
vanishes
leaving
the
least
lacing
ive
ever
seen
in
a
commercial
beer
color
is
a
pale
brownish
amber
slight
caramel
flavor
is
only
good
feature
i
think
slightest
hint
of
dishwater
taste
must
be
the
hops
too
sweet
to
be
refreshing
insipid
is
the
best
short
description
not
an
impressive
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
either
almost
a
two
finger
head
of
cotton
looking
foam
that
lasted
about
as
long
as
a
fly
in
a
crowd
of
frogs
little
lace
to
this
one
just
a
slight
spotting
on
the
side
of
my
mug
color
is
a
9
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
no
haze
and
plenty
of
little
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
smell
has
the
fragrances
of
clover
honey
dried
wheat
and
oats
cooked
corn
and
malt
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
flavors
of
malt
honey
slight
spices
and
toasted
wheat
mouthfeel
is
crisp
great
zing
from
the
carbonation
medium
creaminess
and
a
freshness
that
cleans
my
upper
palate
a
good
refreshing
beer
with
a
out
front
flavor
leaving
very
little
after
taste
with
the
exception
on
a
honey
sweetness
i
cant
believe
i
ever
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
in
the
past
im
so
glad
my
palate
has
changed
its
like
adding
honey
to
something
bland
but
even
the
honey
has
a
hard
time
making
its
presence
known
less
than
average
i
used
to
love
this
beer
but
since
ive
tasted
true
great
beer
this
now
leaves
me
with
a
lot
to
be
desired
a
bit
dissapointed
by
this
one
not
bad
but
not
great
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
fast
diminshing
head
a
slight
scent
of
wheat
malts
and
little
honey
taste
is
rather
light
and
simple
every
bit
of
the
taste
is
too
weak
you
really
have
to
search
for
the
honey
its
drinkable
but
could
really
use
more
depth
to
its
taste
something
to
add
to
your
list
of
beers
drank
but
thats
about
it
overall
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
in
this
beer
im
a
fan
of
leinenkugels
honey
weiss
so
i
figured
combining
red
lager
one
of
my
more
favorable
styles
and
honey
would
be
good
i
might
get
this
again
because
its
reasonably
priced
and
packs
a
decent
malty
flavor
profile
for
a
change
of
pace
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
decentsized
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
little
bit
of
honey
in
it
but
the
major
aroma
components
are
grain
and
sugar
the
beer
smells
very
sweet
overall
the
flavor
is
also
heavy
on
the
grain
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
malt
mixed
in
nothing
special
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
do
not
like
honeyflavored
beer
light
and
watery
mouthfeel
with
no
crispness
present
from
carbonation
at
all
finish
not
a
lot
going
on
here
from
the
start
to
the
finish
on
the
plate
it
seems
the
beer
does
not
change
in
complexity
the
finish
dies
out
fairly
quickly
and
im
sorry
but
i
do
not
taste
the
notes
of
honey
on
my
palate
overall
underrated
no
doubt
its
a
nice
amber
lager
dont
expect
a
brown
ale
type
body
because
that
is
not
what
youll
get
has
a
decent
head
in
my
meantime
snifter
but
it
doesnt
last
all
that
long
lively
carbonation
to
watch
rise
but
it
comes
off
a
bit
watery
in
with
the
richness
doesnt
smell
much
like
anything
except
weak
malts
and
a
bit
of
honey
taste
is
lacking
good
enough
to
pull
out
for
a
party
though
its
way
more
flavorful
than
the
alternatives
id
love
to
use
this
for
beer
pong
its
not
overly
carbonated
and
wont
fill
you
up
poured
a
transparent
copper
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
little
bit
of
malt
on
the
nose
not
much
honey
really
taste
is
ok
although
its
a
little
weak
decent
flavor
but
nothing
special
good
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
smooth
but
not
a
great
beer
nonetheless
this
is
a
tasty
and
easytodrink
lighter
beer
that
doesnt
offend
and
id
get
again
to
share
with
friends
most
people
will
criticize
it
for
its
lack
of
complexity
and
character
that
aside
you
absolutely
cannot
beat
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
the
honey
brown
is
a
consistent
smooth
beer
that
will
satisfy
the
average
beer
drinker
and
should
keep
the
beer
snob
moderately
happy
it
has
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brown
ale
taste
with
a
semistrong
malty
flavor
no
doubt
the
honey
it
is
sweeter
than
most
lagers
but
not
overbearing
if
you
do
not
mind
a
lager
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
it
will
be
a
good
choice
however
if
a
yuengling
is
too
sweet
for
you
stay
away
from
notes
at
old
chicago
2001
pours
a
lighter
transluecent
amber
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
went
away
quickly
aroma
of
malts
honey
and
roasted
peanuts
taste
of
honey
and
a
slight
roastiness
some
roasted
malts
average
beer
better
than
a
majority
of
the
macros
very
mainstream
mild
caramel
malt
flavour
with
very
low
bitterness
light
body
with
decent
carbonation
d
this
one
renews
my
faith
in
lagers
thanks
to
this
beer
look
forward
to
diving
deeper
into
this
style
this
beer
is
what
it
is
it
is
a
good
example
of
a
crappy
style
i
guess
d
drinkable
yes
good
no
better
than
bmc
beers
but
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
too
light
and
unexceptional
on
the
pallet
to
be
a
single
drink
beer
and
too
sickly
sweet
with
the
honey
to
be
a
session
beer
d
at
4
5
i
might
as
well
be
drinking
light
beers
a
easy
going
beer
that
probably
wont
creep
up
on
you
overall
im
up
in
the
wind
with
weather
i
like
it
or
not
i
mean
its
not
bad
but
at
the
same
time
its
not
great
so
i
guess
im
saying
i
wont
be
making
any
more
purchases
of
this
but
if
you
offered
me
one
i
would
have
one
or
two
altogether
not
an
absolute
horrible
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
be
picking
this
one
up
again
the
foam
was
an
almost
white
wheat
color
smooth
bubbly
and
dissapated
quickly
the
color
was
a
very
deep
gold
with
amber
highlights
the
smell
was
a
floral
hops
aroma
with
hints
of
toasted
wood
and
a
very
light
orange
peel
undertone
the
taste
had
a
definate
hops
overtone
but
too
overbearing
a
earthy
wood
and
soil
undertone
with
floral
and
citrus
highlights
mouthfeel
light
bodied
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
was
an
ok
beer
due
to
the
earthy
undertones
but
almost
drowned
out
by
the
lack
of
flavors
and
aromas
not
a
personal
favorite
just
below
average
d
man
i
knew
of
this
stuff
when
i
was
drinking
crappy
bmc
because
it
is
a
slight
step
above
it
drinkable
light
with
flavor
and
refreshing
a
nice
starter
to
craft
beer
drinkability
is
definitely
good
perfect
for
hot
summer
days
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
golden
red
color
with
a
head
that
was
not
very
think
and
quickly
disappeared
in
this
aspect
i
was
not
very
impressed
i
like
a
good
head
there
was
not
a
strong
smell
but
it
was
slightly
sweet
i
however
thought
it
was
pretty
tasty
for
a
lighter
beer
my
girlfriend
who
usually
sticks
to
the
yellow
fizzy
beers
such
as
bud
light
actually
enjoyed
this
one
the
taste
was
not
very
strong
and
somewhat
sweet
which
is
expected
from
a
honey
beer
if
you
are
in
to
an
strong
hoppy
flavor
this
beer
isnt
for
you
however
it
is
a
lager
this
beer
is
light
and
very
drinkable
something
you
might
want
if
entertaining
nonadvocates
of
good
bold
strong
beer
i
like
most
types
of
beer
and
enjoyed
this
one
for
an
easy
drinking
sweet
lager
all
in
all
this
is
one
i
would
try
if
trying
to
get
someone
away
from
drinking
massproduced
economy
beer
and
trying
to
expand
their
horizons
beyond
bud
coors
or
miller
into
more
distinct
beers
verdict
d
very
drinkable
but
not
enjoyable
it
really
does
not
taste
like
much
bland
very
average
to
below
drinkable
but
not
much
in
flavor
d
easy
to
drink
average
not
impressed
expected
sweeter
taste
to
be
called
a
honey
d
good
in
terms
of
being
able
to
down
this
rather
easily
but
it
isnt
great
id
definitely
have
a
couple
of
pints
before
moving
on
without
feeling
offended
i
just
feel
that
for
this
style
its
a
weak
attempt
and
seeing
as
this
is
one
of
my
preferred
beer
styles
to
drink
id
get
several
others
before
picking
this
up
again
oh
well
its
still
something
id
recommend
someone
try
as
a
stepping
stone
label
sucks
too
12oz

taste
is
of

no

on
the

at
all
finish
is
completely
absent
i
will
skip
this
one
next
time
pours
a
pretty
amber
color
with
reddish
tints
a
thick
white
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
smells
very
sweet
much
like
a
frappe
if
that
is
a
good
thing
tastes
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
honey
and
some
well
balanced
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
nice
drinkability
is
high
drinkability
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
wasnt
full
enough
for
me
i
mean
i
can
drink
it
but
im
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
beer
it
is
better
than
any
macro
and
lemon
zest
the
taste
runs
along
a
similar
course
leaving
thick
but
the
subpar
flavor
doesnt
really
help
anything
if
im
going
to
drink
something
this
weak

drinkability
a
very
average
lager
certainly
better
than
most
other
macro
offerings
but
still
pretty
pedestrian
in
my
opinion
drinkability
well
while
not
the
most
exciting
buzz
worthy
beer
this
is
definitely
a
great
intro
to
the
craft
world
and
beer
with
real
flavors

eh
my
old
lady
is
both
an
apiarist
and
a
meaderist
so
i
wonder
what
she
thinks
of
this
or
maybe
i
dont
since
she
is
rather
outspoken
the
pour
gave
me
just
over
a
finger
of
fluffy
eggshellwhite
head
with
great
retention
and
the
beginnings
of
decent
lacing
color
was
a
bit
on
the
golden
side
for
an
amberred
but
it
did
exhibit
nequality
clarity
nose
had
an
odd
nicotinetobacco
smell
and
i
am
sitting
in
my
absolutely
smokefree
kitchen
as
i
type
this
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
slight
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
also
experienced
an
odd
flavor
that
reminded
me
of
freshly
bleached
laundry
oof
finish
was
slightly
sweet
but
overall
this
was
not
worthy
sorry
d
i
would
consider
this
a
quite
drinkable
beer
although
the
mild
sweetness
would
stop
me
after
a
couple
beer
made
with
honey
once
served
in
a
pilsener
bayern
glass

browncrystal

lots
of
bubbles
thin
foamy

fine
the

looks

clean
just
sweet
malt
and
honey
nothing
else
maybe
a
little
toffee
too
taste
sweet
and
toffee
malt
lots
of
honey
and
some
floral
hops
mouthfeel
clean
little
bitter
with
a
sweet
finish
light
and
soft
body
drinkability
very
acceptable
and
very
sweet
dundees
honey
brown
was
probably
the
shit
back
in
the
age
of
disco
but
these
days
craft
beer
drinkers
expect
more
from
their
beer
not
a
horrible
option
and
maybe
worth
a
try
just
for
the
sake
of
nostalgia
drinkability
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
and
with
no
trouble
that
slight
alcohol
taste
however
is
a
bit
confusing
to
me
i
was
hoping
against
it
due
to
its
low
abv
notes
there
is
definitely
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
however
it
doesnt
really
do
anything
for
me
either
it
is
really
just
a
premium
lager
with
some
honey
d
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
i
could
easily
quaff
this
beer
all
night
especially
with
the
4
5
i
think
as
i
drank
it
i
wasnt
able
to
pick
up
the
mellow
honey
flavors
as
well
worth
a
try
i
might
have
this
one
again
not
sure
if
i
liked
it
enough
though
cheers
pretty
good
drinkability
definatly
a
sessionable
beer
be
it
a
weekend
party
or
just
mowin
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
id
take
this
over
any
macro
but
not
by
much
definatly
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
d
maybe
i
am
reminisicing
of
my
college
days
however
this
is
a
drinkable
craft
beer
the
theme
contributes
to
an
easy
drinking
session
very
crisp
very
light
very
feasible
semicraft
like
experience
drinkability
pleasant
and
not
too
heavy
high
marks
taste
big
letdown
too
sweet
man
honey
should
not
dominate
the
taste
buds
no
hopping
is
this
like
a
numead
or
maybe
get
some
stronger
malt
so
the
honey
isnt
so
prolific
or
whatever
is
causing
the
sweetness
almost
cloying
you
cant
even
get
used
to
it
halfway
through
expensive
and
not
too
likeable
decently
drinkable
with
its
low
abv
and
quick
finish
still
not
something
id
look
to
have
more
of
though
i
have
had
many
label
versions
of
this
over
the
years
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
as
far
as
beer
sales
and
investing
in
marketing
pours
a
deep
gold
little
head
smell
and
taste
has
a
tinge
of
sweetness
and
honey
not
much
body
but
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
step
up
from
the
macros
has
more
flavors
and
body
but
not
by
much
this
beer
is
good
if
not
overtly
remarkable
it
wont
explode
your
taste
buds
with
overbearing
100
ibu
bitterness
and
thats
a
good
thing
dundee
honey
brown
is
a
solid
every
mans
beer
that
enthusiasts
and
casual
observers
alike
can
enjoy
it
is
one
of
the
beers
i
keep
on
hand
at
most
times
theres
really
nothing
remarkable
about
this
one
its
cheap
seems
pretty
easy
to
brew
but
it
usually
satisfies
me
when
im
drinking
it
with
some
sort
of
light
food
or
just
watching
a
game
solid
pours
deep
golden
with
a
suggestion
of
amber
with
nice
white
head
nose
is
soft
with
some
honey
and
a
light
biscuitytoasty
quality
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
more
of
the
biscuit
and
honey
character
but
is
still
light
on
the
flavor
profile
result
is
very
good
drinkability
not
a
bad
session
beer
or
something
that
i
would
consider
with
breakfast
biscuits
of
course
overall
an
affordable
sessionable
beer
would
make
a
nice
transition
beer
for
macrobeer
drinkers
to
enter
the
craft
beer
world
poured
from
the
bottle
with
average
head
no
lacing
clear
light
bronzehoney
color
could
easily
pick
up
the
honey
from
both
smell
and
taste
it
was
a
very
unique
beer
unlike
anything
i
had
tried
before
however
i
didnt
particularly
like
it
i
liked
the
idea
of
adding
honey
and
it
had
a
somewhat
soothing
texture
to
it
but
overall
it
was
not
very
good
i
guess
its
just
a
strange
beer
that
doesnt
do
it
for
me
the
flavor
is
a
weak
malt
component
with
a
better
the
meh
hop
edge
that
i
would
describe
as
being
similar
or
slight
better
than
the
best
bmc
the
honey
sweetness
reminds
me
that
theres
more
malt
and
really
i
could
better
describe
this
as
being
closer
to
yuengling
with
honey
the
mouth
feel
is
good
fizzy
and
thick
and
not
too
watery
over
all
drinkable
but
just
so
to
be
fair
i
had
this
beer
straight
from
the
bottle
no
pour
although
i
have
had
it
before
smells
sweet
but
not
necessarily
like
honey
to
me
then
a
bit
of
maltiness
the
taste
was
light
grainy
malt
mostly
and
again
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
approached
a
honey
flavor
but
wasnt
quite
there
the
beer
doesnt
taste
bad
theres
just
not
much
there
not
as
thin
as
i
expected
nice
crisp
finish
its
drinkable
but
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
drink
when
youre
not
paying
attention
drinkability
is
ok
i
can
put
down
a
couple
before
the
sweetness
really
starts
becoming
too
much
with
nothing
to
balance
it
out
d
uhhhh
i
finished
it
that
should
count
for
something
right
that
will
be
my
last
d
ok
too
sweet
to
score
any
better
crisp
mouthfeel
tingly
and
dry
very
bubbly
tasty
beer
not
overly
complex
but
fairly
drinkable
nice
clean
flavor
mostly
honey
and
a
little
malt
golden
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
overall
well
balanced
and
pleasingnot
knock
your
socks
off
bitter
not
too
complex
but
a
good
summer
kick
back
kind
of
beer
12
oz
bottle
from

pack
to
glass
amber

smells
sweet
but
i
didnt
really
pick
up

taste
is
pretty
onedimensional
mellow
malty
sweetness
really
no
hops
or
any
bitter
to
balance
it
out
somewhat
drinkable
but
gets
boring
after
several
sips
for
a
beer
that
i
drank
in
college
it
is
a
good
rememberence
of
good
times
ive
had
and
beer
that
i
drank
i
think
it
should
be
given
another
chance
every
beer
deserves
another
sip
great
alternative
to
sam
adams
or
blue
point
toasted
lager
especially
with
the
price
difference

pack
a
very
drinkable
lager
which
although
not
full
of
flavor
makes
a
really
good
session
beer
and
a
great
alternative
to
any
macro
you
might
usually
seek
out
give
this
a
try
value
ive
seen
this
priced
at
over
8
00
a
six
pack
i
think
not
d
not
a
bad
brew
and
i
would
definitely
take
it
over
many
other
lesser
beers
its
probably
better
to
drink
this
one
a
little
on
the
colder
side
but
it
would
definitely
be
refreshing
under
the
right
circumstances
and
old
favorite
from
college
still
good
after
all
these
years
the
honey
smell
is
apparent
out
of
the
bottle
think
and
sweet
along
with
some
caramel
malt
pours
a
well
honeycolored
amber
with
about
2
inches
of
head
in
a
pint
glass
which
fairly
quickly
recedes
down
to
about
half
an
inch
leaving
no
lace
and
then
stays
for
a
while
flavor
approximately
matches
the
smell
with
just
a
little
bit
of
green
grass
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
thicker
than
your
average
lager
in
its
mouthfeel
not
a
lot
of
obvious
carbonation
has
a
lot
of
the
characteristics
id
ordinarily
associate
with
a
brown
ale
but
somewhat
lighter
no
hop
bitterness
to
speak
of
and
goes
down
smooth
i
like
it
as
an
interesting
substitute
for
either
a
lager
or
a
brown
ale
and
on
top
of
that
its
dirt
cheap
pours
a
yellow
color
that
has
a
bit
of
orange
to
it
and
is
clear
forceful
pour
produces
less
than
a
finger
of
white
head
that
receeds
fast
but
laces
a
bit
on
the
way
down
slight
bit
of
malt
in
the
nose
blended
with
a
sweetness
that
i
am
assuming
to
be
the
honey
addition
slight
bit
of
sulfur
twang
in
there
as
well
in
the
end
of
the
aroma
taste
is
a
let
down
it
has
a
lingering
sweetness
and
that
is
about
all
that
the
taste
has
to
offer
not
malty
sweet
but
honey
sweet
mostly
finish
is
crisp
feel
is
light
and
carb
is
right
on
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
you
could
probably
session
the
heck
out
of
this
beer
if
you
enjoy
the
honey
sweetness
once
was
enough
for
me
thin

foam

of
ratcheting
up

sweetness

i
mean
its
alright
but
not
sure
why
someone
would
really
choose
to
drink
it
per
se
these
go
down
easy
and
are
actually
mild
enough
on
the
palate
to
have
more
than
one
of
not
too
exciting
but
drinkable
the
beer
actually
burps
quite
pleasantly
overall
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
beer
and
it
pretty
much
hit
the
mark
meh
poured
from
a
12
bottle
to
a
pilsner
style
glass
little
to
no
head
on
this
brew
and
directly
after
pouring
there
is

noted

with
very
lite
mouthfeel
taste
is
sugary

sweet
small
hints

notes
finishes
quite
dry
it
would
be
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
with
some
salty
or
spicey
food
not
a
bad
beer
something
to
have
on
hand
for
the
bmc
drinkers
in
your
life
dr
goes
down
okay
not
offensive
but
there
are
lots
of
choices
out
there
notes
perhaps
like
all
the
rest
of
the
beers
in
this
mixed
pack
a
bit
offstyle
but
probably
the
most
drinkable
of
the
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
cheers
pours
a
honey
golden
color
in
the
glass
with
a
white
froth
simply
and
straight
forward
this
beer
shows
some
caramel
sweet
honey
and
grains
this
really
is
a
simple
beer
that
i
can
easily
see
myself
drinking
a
few
off
during
a
summer
bbq
nothing
special
here
but
easy
to
drink
would
go
great
with
honeybbq
ribs
or
even
orange
chicken
an
easy
beer
to
drink
the
head
is
thick
but
doesnt
retain
well
the
beer
has
a
decent
not
overpowering
smell
no
real
aftertaste
to
speak
of
no
strong
tannins
the
sweetness
and
flavor
are
appropriate
for
the
style
the
color
is
slightly
lighter
than
most
honey
brown
ales
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
much
character
nice
beer
for
sunday
football
this
is
an
ok
beer
that
goes
down
fairly
smooth
and
has
some
definite
honeycomb
sweetness
to
it
taking
a
whiff
is
like
smelling
a
warm
buttermilk
biscuit
that
has
been
lathered
with
sweet
sticky
honey
the
sweetness
comes
out
in
the
taste
which
isnt
much
more
than
your
average
lager
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
alright
great
beer
golden
light
brown
sweet
malty
husk
notes
hit
the
palate
with
moderate
carbonation
honey
coats
the
palate
during
the
after
taste
and
lingers
for
15
seconds
def
a
great
session
beer
its
def
a
step
above
the
macros
perfer
it
straight
from
the
bottle
and
or
on
tap
p

rochester
ny
baby
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
small
white
head
very
subdued
aromas
of
light
malts
the
honey
comes
through
on
the
palate
but
not
the
nose
light
sweet
maltiness
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
body
is
thin
overall
its
not
bad
but
neither
is
it
interesting
d
you
can
pound
these
back
like
there
is
no
tomorrow
if
that
is
what
you
want
to
do
there
is
zero
i
mean
zero
complexity
to
this
brew
though
ive
never
had
a
honey
beer
before
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
this
beer
is
unbearable
for
me
to
drink
its
way
too
sweet
and
not
in
a
good
way
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
can
tell
it
is
marketed
more
toward
the
bmc
crowd
with
all
their
beers
from
this
brewery
being
watery
going
with
a
bmc
stance
on
things
i
almost
enjoyed
this
beer
a
little
to
much
but
nice
beer
to
sip
on
inbetween
the
big
boys
pours
a
honey
like
color
like
an
ice
tea
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
that
is
a
very
slight
off
white
the
smell
is
of
a
sweet
roasted
malt
backbone
with
a
honey
presence
and
a
little
caramel
the
taste
is
of
the
sweet
roasted
malt
backbone
with
honey
and
a
sugary
presence
the
taste
was
a
little
watery
but
a
little
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
moderate
carbonation
and
a
little
slick
overall
it
is
very
drinkable
but
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
flavor
other
honeys
have
been
a
thicker
fuller
taste
without
the
sweetness
its
sweet
malty
but
im
not
sure
i
would
identify
the
honey
not
a
lot
of
hops
and
it
feels
watery
overall
very
drinkable
to
start
but
the
sweetness
tends
to
become
cumulative
over
time
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
with
food
but
on
its
own
it
drags
cheers
d
easy
drinking
has
a
little
bit
something
to
make
it
above
average
but
could
go
a
little
higher
with
some
effort
number
three
from
my
mixed
12
pack
of
dundee
beers
yellow
with
about
a
1
head
smell
is
all
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
nice
actually
i
drank
this
one
late
in
the
evening
when
i
was
getting
tired
and
about
ready
to
call
it
an
evening
and
this
was
a
good
beer
to
get
ready
for
bed
on
nicely
sweet
not
too
much
carbonation
a
nice
last
beer
of
the
evening
im
going
to
bed
beer
would
mix
nicely
with
a
slice
of
pie
when
you
get
home
and
are
a
little
peckish
before
bed
taste
there
is
also
a
sweetness
to
this
beer
but
almost
a
little
too
sweet
pretty
good
taste
but
lacks
much
complexity
and
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
light
and
drinkable
d
not
bad
but
not
one
to
buy
again
i
drank
this
all
the
time
while
living
in
rochesterit
was
always
brewed
recently
and
tasted
quite
different
from
the
bottle
i
am
reviewing
here
bought
in
a
package
store
in
ct
some
of
the
flavors
were
there
but
tasted
watered
down
moe
importantly
the
mouthfeel
was
waterynot
the
robust
creaminess
i
had
come
to
expect
overall
outside
of
the
rochester
area
i
dont
know
that
i
need
to
try
this
again
mediocre
as
far
as
craft
beers
go
falling
in
easily
with
the
likes
of
macro
craft
offerings
such
as
the
michelob
brand
but
easydrinking
and
an
inexpensive
more
flavorful
alternative
to
many
of
the
blander
offerings
out
there
in
the
same
price
range
drinkability
ill
have
the
one
but
this
is
nothing
special
d
meh
if
it
isnt
cheap
it
isnt
worth
it
this
warmed
copper
coloration
beer
pours
with
a
retentive
head
that
keeps
a
fair
amount
as
it
reduces
the
beer
has
the
aroma
of
a
sweet
hopes
that
gives
a
hint
of
honey
as
the
first
sip
of
the
beer
hits
the
taste
buds
it
lights
up
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
tones
of
honey
slight
coriander
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
warm
summer
day
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
light
brownish
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
very
mild
good
taste
mild
and
slightly
sweet
refreshing
medium
bodied
in
mouth
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
my
go
to
low
cost
beer
overall
pretty
good
not
the
best
honey
lager
but
good
d
really
drinkable
although
the
metallic
taste
could
get
a
little
vexing
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
though
id
say
its
definitely
sessionable
md
not
sticky
but
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
body
to
this
beer
that
when
combined
with
its
distinct
sweetness
might
make
this
beer
best
left
for
a
cool
summer
evening
rather
than
a
hot
afternoon
highly
drinkable
unique
and
accessible
to
nonbeer
geeks
with
a
friendly
label
and
twist
off
cap
my
only
beef
is
it
is
in
no
sense
of
the
word
brown
and
that
identification
might
make
it
a
little
less
likely
to
get
picked
up
by
someone
looking
for
something
new
but
scared
of
dark
beers
drinkability
is
good
a
refreshing
lager
and
priced
right
a
good
gateway
craft
beer
honey

honey
slight

a

twist
to
the
usual
fizzy
corn
brew
that
most
people
drink
not
terrible
but
not
impressive
either
d
back
in
my
college
days
this
was
the
beer
we
splurged
on
when
we
wanted
something
good
how
times
have
changed
this
beer
is
average
in
every
aspect
they
go
down
easy
but
not
something
i
could
drink
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
is
high
sweet
but
not
cloying
overall
it
is
nondistinctive
muddy
but
pleasantly
like
cream
soda
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
cheapasdirt
brownish
lager
a
great
value
it
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
the
aroma
had
a
sweetness
to
it
that
was
a
bit
hard
to
point
out
for
the
taste
i
was
expecting
some
honey
flavor
it
was
just
barely
there
perhaps
i
got
spoiled
on
my
mead
trip
a
few
years
ago
and
had
unrealistic
expectations
it
goes
down
the
gullet
very
easy
and
finishes
clean
its
a
nice
summer
fun
beer
drinkability
is
great
on
this
beer
it
is
a
nice
beer
in
a
can
with
some
awesome
crisp
refreshing
qualities
to
it
without
overbearing
taste
buds
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
to
drink
a
6
or
12
pack
of
cans
on
a
hot
summer
day
doing
some
lawn
work
drinkability
light
and
sweet
refreshing
and
accessible
t
m
d
soft
maltiness
the
honey
flavour
is
pleasing
its
maybe
a
little
artificial
tasting
like
golden
grahams
or
the
like
but
its
certainly
honey
it
has
a
nice
crispness
to
it
with
a
lighter
body
so
it
does
well
as
a
refreshing
warm
day
drink
im
having
it
on
a
cooler
rainy
evening
though
so
thats
just
an
assumption
light
alcohol
easy
session
choice
not
the
most
extraordinary
or
even
flavourful
beer
but
sometimes
it
could
be
just
the
thing
its
certainly
a
good
gateway
candidate
a
good
beer
for
macro
lovers
but
a
little
lacking
the
taste
is
very
mild
but
fairly
nice
rather
like
a
more
fullbodied
basic
pale
lager
but
with
noticeable
grain
a
hint
of
pine
and
hay
hint
of
brown
sugar
and
a
light
but
clear
alcoholic
quality
i
noticed
no
honey
in
the
taste
although
as
mentioned
the
aroma
had
a
hint
of
it
its
mostly
sweet
with
a
faint
bitterness
in
the
end
ultimately
its
little
more
than
a
basic
rather
thin
watery
pale
lager
with
a
light
caramelbrown
sugar
quality
it
fairly
drinkable
though
drinkability
easy
to
drink
particularly
if
it
is
a
little
sweetness
you
desire
on
a
hot
day
not
for
me
however
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
it
would
be
pretty
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
as
sweet
it
was
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
it
has
room
for
improvement
but
it
is
still
a
quality
beverage
the
overwhelming
sensation
is
cloying
sweetness
and
watery
mouthfeel
the
aroma
is
that
of
nuts
and
honey
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
sweetness
that
is
underpinnd
by
a
wandering
maltiness
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
think
it
needed
more
malt
dryness
and
honey
aroma
and
maybe
a
touch
of
carawheat
d
an
easily
drinkable
lawnmower
beer
enjoyable
is
certainly
a
way
to
describe
this
drinkability
could
easily
have
more
then
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
easy
drinker
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
taste
last
weekend
fellow
ba
das
freak
showed
up
with
the
dundee
craft
pack
sampler
after
tasting
the
paipaporter
and
pale
bock
lager
i
thought
we
had
stumbled
onto
something
above
average
then
came
the
honey
brown
lager
at
first
i
thought
it
had
a
funky
after
taste
but
it
doesnt
wait
until
after
when
my
dog
broke
wind
i
thought
i
was
at
a
beer
pairing
in
hell
sorry
for
the
negativity
but
if
i
can
save
one
ba
from
this
fate
it
will
have
been
worth
it
d
excellent
and
this
is
the
point
i
believe
this
beer
to
be
made
to
be
drinkable
and
it
delivers
d
easy
drinkable
beer
so
sweet
that
i
would
think
this
has
potential
as
a
summer
drinker
on
the
deck
abv
is
low
and
manageable
drinkability
an
interesting
novelty
beer
shows
much
promise
but
doesnt
deliver
on
it
worth
a
try
but
not
a
revisit
dont
drink
and
review
an
ok
brew
but
not
one
i
anticipate
revisiting
and
not
sure
why
they
call
it
a
brown
as
the
color
is
golden
and
the
malts
are
simpler
if
i
look
at
this
as
a
light
lager
im
pretty
pleased
it
tastes
pleasant
doesnt
pack
much
alcohol
and
is
light
bodied
the
price
is
pretty
decent
still
although
this
used
to
be
quite
a
bit
cheaper
it
was
4
99
a
sixer
not
that
long
ago
11
for
a
12
pack
is
not
bad
and
its
something
the
guests
wont
mind
this
serves
its
purpose
well
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
want
to
say
this
is
preferable
to
the
similar
leinies
honeyweiss
i
would
not
call
myself
an
experienced
beer
drinker
at
this
point
but
am
learning
as
i
go
i
originally
purchased
this
brew
from
pure
looks
it
looked
appealing
and
i
can
appreciate
a
sweet
beer
i
purchased
a
6pack
i
had
nothing
against
the
beer
on
the
first
go
the
next
night
when
i
decided
to
polish
off
the
pack
the
honey
sweetness
really
kicked
in
now
i
do
like
a
brew
that
is
sweet
but
this
one
in
particular
is
too
strong
with
the
honey
its
drinkability
is
smooth
more
like
a
light
beer
i
would
not
put
this
in
the
category
of
a
brown
ale
if
it
were
to
be
this
sweet
i
would
like
to
see
it
with
more
hops
to
balance
it
out
its
smell
does
have
a
hint
of
honey
but
does
not
brace
you
for
the
honey
overload
that
it
will
give
you
good
at
first
but
would
recommend
lighting
up
on
the
honey
flavor
d
4
0
i
dig
this
one
i
would
not
call
it
brown
but
i
do
like
the
honey
addition
almost
overdone
in
the
honey
but
tolerable
for
1
or
2
brews
i
would
home
brew
a
fuller
body
less
sweet
version
of
this
and
love
it
this
is
why
i
bought
it
i
am
working
on
a
recipe
idea
d
i
find
this
drinkable
goes
well
with
pretzels
nothing
extraordinary
but
a
nice
alternative
to
a
standard
lager
heres
a
pretty
good
domestic
beer
its
fairly
comparable
to
leinenkugels
honey
weiss
but
it
has
more
honey
flavor
than
leinies
and
its
a
bit
darker
id
give
this
beer
to
somebody
whos
looking
for
an
alternative
to
their
mainstay
american
lager
the
best
part
about
this
is
the
way
it
looks
everything
else
is
just
average
its
your
run
of
the
mill
assembly
line
beer
i
also
think
its
a
little
confused
the
style
listed
is
an
amber
but
the
beer
calls
itself
a
brown
doesnt
look
like
either
or
really
taste
like
either
the
only
thing
that
saves
this
offering
is
the
honey
adding
a
touch
of
character
to
the
nose
and
taste
overall
pretty
much
what
it
claims
to
be
a
relativly
sweet
lager
that
is
good
on
occasion
the
score
would
be
higher
it
the
beer
didnt
look
or
smell
so
crappy
i
expected
the
worst
but
this
was
a
good
beer
d
its
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
would
every
buy
it
agian
its
just
to
bland
not
enough
taste
t
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
water
and
vaguely
sticky
like
honey
the
taste
of
honey
is
the
leading
flavor
a
very
sweet
beer
and
mild
kind
of
elements
that
i
like
i
feel
a
little
bit
bad
reviewing
this
so
highly
but
cant
help
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
for
some
reason
appearance
was
lightamber
with
your
average
macro
lager
aroma
the
taste
however
was
nicely
balanced
and
pleasant
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
it
wasnt
braggot
sweet
but
just
a
bit
of
it
came
through
from
the
honey
mouthfeel
was
average
and
drinkability
was
good
for
me
because
of
the
taste
update
this
time
around
the
honey
really
seems
to
stick
out
as
an
aftertaste
fresher
batch
maybe
still
very
plain
beer
with
honey
thrown
in
d
respectable
presentation
for
a
honey
ale
delicious
and
refreshing
d
this
is
an
easy
drinker
i
could
see
myself
throwin
back
a
whole
six
pack
of
this
quite
easily
a
pretty
tasty
mild
light
beer
id
recommend
it
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
and
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
put
away
could
be
a
good
session
to
start
someone
new
to
craft
beer
on
d
this
is
definitely
a
macro
drinkers
micro
very
sweet
honey
flavor
is
about
the
only
thing
that
differentiates
it
from
other
lagers
i
remember
this
being
one
the
first
beers
that
caused
me
to
become
interested
in
better
beer
i
also
gave
it
to
my
now
roommate
freshman
year
and
it
was
the
first
beer
he
had
in
college
so
fond
memories
from
a
mediocre
beer
that
seems
as
though
it
were
a
macro
crossed
with
root
beer
and
honey
ill
be
bock
unimpressive
sure
drinkable
most
definitely
this
beer
unlike
other
mass
produced
lagers
actually
tastes
really
good
yes
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
but
this
is
a
great
beer
to
go
to
after
having
one
or
two
already
if
you
want
to
mellow
out
nothing
super
special
but
not
deserving
of
the
bad
rap
i
feel
im
a
huge
proponent
of
wildly
complex
expensive
artsy
beers
but
sometimes
you
dont
want
a
quad
or
an
double
ipa
sometimes
all
you
want
is
something
that
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
good
too
there
are
definitely
better
session
beers
out
there
but
this
isnt
bad
i
bought
a
sampler
pack
to
review
all
the
dundee
beers
and
thought
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
start
as
this
offering
was
the
only
one
i
had
previously
sampled
i
found
this
beer
a
bit
too
unbalanced
and
thick
for
my
liking
it
seemed
to
lack
crispness
and
contain
a
bit
to
much
of
what
i
would
call
processed
flavors
based
on
what
the
bottle
and
box
said
i
should
expect
i
wouldnt
not
have
guessed
that
this
brew
would
taste
like
it
did
its
not
particularly
bad
but
i
dont
think
its
too
special
either
d
overall
im
a
fan
of
the
body
but
anything
this
sweet
is
offputting
and
makes
me
glad
that
there
are
only
two
in
the
variety
pack
i
just
got
the
flavor
isnt
terrible
but
12
ounces
of
it
seems
to
last
too
long
this
beer
poured
a
orangecopper
collor
with
a
twofinger
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
the
smell
is
sweet
with
malts
and
honey
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweetness
that
reflects
the
smell
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
in
the
middle
and
a
bit
of
honey
in
the
backend
the
beer
itself
is
a
little
watery
with
a
decent
amount
of
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
is
a
good
starter
beer
for
people
who
arent
sure
if
they
like
beer
or
not
no
bitter
after
taste
but
it
is
perhaps
a
bit
watery
i
havent
had
one
for
a
while
but
i
imagine
it
would
be
much
too
sweet
for
me
now
still
a
very
easydrinking
pint
as
others
have
pointed
out
its
sort
of
funny
that
its
called
brown
as
it
clearly
is
not
in
a
pint
glass
a
decent
with
medium
carbonation

bought
this
hoping
this
would
be
close
to
my
much
loved
barbar
considering
the
price
and
what
they
were
apparently
going
for
clydesdalenov
07
d
very
its
super
easy
to
drink
this
one
perhaps
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
commercials
way
back
when
it
came
out
with
the
little
tiki
statue
and
the
slogan
beware
the
beer
god
when
i
was
a
kid
and
saw
that
i
thought
a
beer
with
honey
cant
wait
to
try
that
oh
how
naive
youth
is
i
see
the
labels
changed
but
the
beer
still
sucks
pours
a
darkish
gold
with
a
onefinger
head
that
died
quickly
some
sweet
malt
smells
honey
and
caramel
mixed
with
minor
citric
hops
watery
and
slick
thinbodied
a
mellow
hop
falvor
and
a
not
very
sweet
malt
taste
goes
down
easy
too
easy
not
worth
having
d
not
that
enjoyable
wont
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
not
wonderful
but
not
too
hard
to
drink
either
it
goes
down
rather
easy
and
id
drink
another
or
two
but
i
could
think
of
better
tasting
bears
to
drink
had
i
the
choice
d
its
an
interesting
style
with
the
honey
and
all
really
didnt
like
the
sweet
after
taste

picked
up
some
24
oz
tall
boys
for
1
69
now
there
is
something
to
get
excited
about
overall
not
bad
a
light
lager
with
a
pinch
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
honey
i
am
not
sure
which
one
dominated
though
i
would
have
liked
to
see
both
be
a
little
stronger
still
not
terrible
at
all
a
nice
mix
of
malt
and
honey
flavors
lend
an
enjoyable
sweetness
that
never
gets
cloying
the
honey
really
helps
smooth
out
the
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
a
very
nice
session
brew
at
9
99
a
12
pack
its
a
great
deal
if
you
are
looking
for
a
smooth
easydrinking
lager
with
some
flavor
this
beer
doesnt
look
like
much
sort
of
a
straw
color
with
very
little
head
absolutely
no
lacing
smell
is
very
grainy
taste
is
relatively
sweet
not
too
bad
really
a
touch
of
honey
along
with
a
touch
of
hops
its
very
carbonated
and
very
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
summertime
beer
tastes
excellent
out
on
a
boat
fishing
i
would
definitely
drink
these
again
for
the
price
definitely
recommended
if
your
just
looking
for
something
different
i
read
the
name
honey
brown
and
thought
it
would
be
just
a
little
darker
i
was
really
let
down
with
this
beer
not
something
i
will
be
drinking
again
d
i
woundnt
drink
it
with
a
meal
unless
i
needed
something
sweet
to
contratc
the
dish
it
is
more
of
an
end
of
dayafternoon
beer
especially
if
a
sunny
patio
is
calling
you
an
its
low
alcohol
level
and
light
feel
means
that
if
you
wish
couple
will
work
nicely
for
you
but
one
thing
is
for
sure
i
youre
not
a
honey
fan
then
dont
even
try
out
of
curiousity
you
have
been
warned
i
remember
this
beer
being
around
for
a
while
one
of
the
first
nonbmc
beers
i
tried
back
in
the
day
revisiting
it
it
isnt
too
spectacular
barely
any
honey
taste
at
all
but
its
smooth
and
heavier
bodied
than
the
usual
cheap
beers
drinkability
however
is
pretty
top
notch
a
six
pack
of
this
could
go
pretty
quickly
but
yeah
for
an
amber
beer
this
is
a
good
new
york
brew
to
get
your
hands
on
some
new
notes
had
one
on
122909
as
part
of
a
christmas
pack
of
beers
more
honey
flavor
that
i
remembered
on
the
front
of
the
sip
im
surprised
pretty
solid
i
figured
id
rate
this
one
a
little
lower
as
i
drink
more
and
more
different
beers
that
i
love
but
if
anything
it
gets
a
slight
boost
up
id
give
this
to
someone
whos
afraid
to
venture
away
from
the
mainstream
beers
one
for
price
and
two
for
the
drinkablilty
which
is
was
most
novices
look
for
in
the
first
place
its
good
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
buy
it
for
6
00
a
six
for
instance
if
you
are
forced
to
drink
a
dundee
beer
this
one
isnt
too
painful
though
i
wouldnt
recommend
anything
from
the
line
except
if
you
are
stranded
in
upstate
new
york
with
no
alternatives
and
you
are
in
extreme
need
of
a
beer
d
drinkablility
limited
to
1
or
2
due
to
sweetness
pours
a
clear
rusty
amber
with
hay
sunshine
highlights
very
little
head
right
after
the
pour
that
quickly
dissipates
to
nothing
the
aroma
has
notes
of
cramel
honey
and
white
bread
in
an
overall
soft
aroma
the
taste
starts
with
soft
white
breads
that
slowly
reveal
the
dripping
honey
that
leads
to
a
soft
bready
malt
finish
wth
some
light
white
tea
hops
the
palate
is
very
easy
and
balnced
ending
in
a
very
balanced
honey
lager
very
underrated
beer
in
my
opinion
the
beer
seems
unbalanced
and
confused
i
feel
like
this
one
is
an
over
processed
brew
that
was
created
on
auto
pilot
packaging
is
probably
the
biggest
seller
of
this
beer
not
the
contents
itself
well
i
didnt
expect
much
and
i
didnt
get
much
somewhat
of
a
below
average
beer
decent
sessionability
as
one
would
be
with
low
abv
and
drinks
like
water
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
great
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
drinkability
is
good
but
it
would
be
too
sweet
to
drink
all
night
the
taste
was
very
mild
semisweet
it
was
smooth
and
had
a
light
bitterness
at
the
end
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
if
i
had
a
choice
a
good
beer
to
go
to
when
thirsty
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
something
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
complex
with
an
attitude
pass
on
this
one
d
really
good
i
could
enjoy
and
indeed
have
enjoyed
several
of
these
in
one
session
it
wasnt
bad
but
this
one
seems
to
drink
better
cold
right
out
of
the
fridge
has
lots
of
carbonation
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
almost
no
bitterness
or
hop
flavor
but
still
a
strong
honey
taste
to
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
almost
like
a
light
beer
very
light
and
unimpressive
this
beer
is
like
most
of
their
products
watery
and
mass
produced
bad
beer
actually
feels
creamy
for
a
lager
closer
to
a
pub
ale
feel
crisp
enough
not
terrible
but
wouldnt
be
my
goto
choice
its
a
honeysoaked
macro
lager
terribly
underrated
beer
that
is
actually
quite
drinkable
i
hadnt
had
one
in
quite
a
while
and
i
was
bit
surprised
at
how
smooth
and
balanced
it
is
poured
a
very
pale
amber
color
just
a
shade
darker
than
golden
with
a
little
head
and
some
nice
lacing
it
had
a
nice
scent
fairly
weak
with
malt
and
biscuit
tones
and
a
bit
of
honey
scent
that
helped
good
taste
descent
lager
better
than
a
macro
and
the
honey
flavor
added
a
fair
bit
to
it
it
went
down
smooth
a
nice
thirst
quencher
i
dont
know
this
isnt
terrible
but
it
just
doesnt
offer
much
i
remember
drinking
this
in
college
it
was
better
than
swill
and
didnt
cost
much
more
than
a
sixer
of
bud
anyway
aroma
is
really
not
present
except
for
a
faint
scent
that
lets
you
know
this
is
beer
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
decent
white
head
and
some
proper
lacing
not
bad
slightly
creamy
and
full
on
the
palate
with
a
smooth
clean
finish
again
not
bad
flavor
is
of
a
crisp
lager
rather
bland
but
there
is
a
nice
touch
of
honey
sweetness
after
the
swallow
mellow
and
easy
to
drink
dont
expect
anything
great
id
say
this
was
an
average
drinker
nothing
interesting
stands
out
at
all
although
i
havent
had
many
honey
lagers
i
expected
more
honey
taste
overall
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
d
yuck
i
am
having
a
hard
time
putting
this
oe
down
and
may
be
dumping
it
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
the
sampler
or
any
other
dundee
beer
drinkability
bleh
im
slowly
working
my
way
through
the
jw
dundees
box
of
horrors
and
this
one
so
far
is
the
worst
of
the
lot
again
bleh
the
drink
is
very
smooth
with
plenty
of
gummy
sweetness
holding
on
and
hanging
around
reminds
me
of
st
arnolds
fancy
lawnmower
a
sweet
easydrinking
lager
all
sweet
with
very
little
bitter
and
light
carbonation
great
beer
for
hot
summer
days
a
little
weak
in
flavor
overall
but
definitely
honey
sweet
and
a
good
summer
lager
could
use
a
little
more
body
but
a
beautiful
beer
to
pour
in
a
pint
glass
a
clean
soft
lager
not
much
in
the
flavor
department
but
where
it
lacks
interesting
flavors
it
also
lacks
all
potentially
unpleasant
flavors
a
good
nobrainer
a
good
flagship
for
a
brewery
thats
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
more
interested
in
selling
beer
than
brewing
it
not
a
bad
beer
in
fact
it
was
the
first
case
that
was
ever
purchased
for
me
about
ten
or
so
years
ago
decent
session
beer
d
ok
session
beer
a
safe
bet
for
someone
who
doesnt
want
to
stray
too
far
from
the
macro
path
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
medium
head
on
a
lovely
amber
body
smell
was
unremarkable
nothing
to
mention
however
the
honey
sweet
taste
and
smoothness
were
excellent
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
aftertaste
surprisingly
good
despite
its
overall
grade
here
i
could
drink
this
all
day
well
done
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
recommend
this
one
pours
as
the
name
suggests
a
honey
brown
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
a
bit
faint
some
sweet
caramel
malt
honey
and
a
light
clove
spiciness
the
taste
is
sweet
honey
malt
a
bit
bready
not
much
else
the
feel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
finishes
with
a
somewhat
smooth
malty
sweetness
no
real
strong
flavors
and
a
sweet
honey
smoothness
makes
this
brew
quite
drinkable
the
sweetness
is
not
cloying
works
well
a
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
day
overall
this
is
a
fair
brew
but
nothing
to
seek
out
mouthfeel
is
crisp
macro
lagery
nothing
super
special
i
would
buy
again
over
some
beers
but
only
bought
this
time
around
because
it
was
on
sale
generous
twofinger
pure
white
frothy
head
sits
on
an
effervescent
honeygolden
body
head
that
simmers
to
a
single
finger
sweet
honey
scents
couple
with
malts
in
a
formidable
yet
inoffensive
pairing
that
is
somewhat
distinctive
substantial
palate
like
an
oldschool
lager
meant
for
weighty
significance
moreso
than
pure
drinkabilityand
yet
this
could
play
both
the
serious
actor
as
well
as
a
party
extra
sixpack
versatile
malty
in
the
back
honey
up
front
clove
in
the
middlethe
balance
is
unique
and
refreshing
like
a
liquid
graham
cracker
and
i
know
that
does
not
sound
appetizing
safe
to
say
this
rating
will
well
exceed
the
respect
of
the
masses
but
dundees
honey
brown
was
my
first
beer
love
and
though
ive
seen
many
others
since
1997
i
keep
coming
back
to
the
sweet
maltiness
that
i
dranksometimes
warm
to
ward
away
roommatesduring
those
wonderful
college
days
this
was
the
beer
in
hand
when
i
innocently
talked
to
my
future
wife
for
the
first
time
in
bill
hesss
taverns
basement
the
beer
i
carried
in
a
backpack
at
bloomsburg
block
parties
and
still
the
treat
on
humid
summer
nights
like
this
one
inexpensive
and
casually
impressive
im
biased
but
we
are
allowed
one
guilty
pleasure
on
this
site
i
hopeit
is
beer
after
all
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
light
like
a
bitter
with
a
good
honey
flavor
d
i
have
a
place
in
my
beer
drinkers
heart
for
honey
brown
this
along
with
petes
got
me
drinking
stuff
other
than
macros
and
when
i
couldnt
afford
german
offerings
around
here
as
far
as
drinkability
you
really
cant
drink
too
many
i
dont
know
why
nor
can
explain
it
it
just
overwhelms
you
if
you
try
to
drink
this
like
a
macro
considering
it
is
the
same
price
just
sits
heavy
and
not
too
comfortable
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
find
myself
slumming
with
it
every
now
and
again
notes
honey
brown
is
very
refreshing
clean
and
simple
not
bad
at
all
for
the
price
ill
still
drink
a
couple
for
the
nostalgia
factor
but
ive
moved
on
to
bigger
better
beers
d
not
offensive
easy
drinkinging
abv
makes
it
so
you
can
put
down
a
number
of
these
good
value
for
a
decent
beer
but
for
taste
versus
price
id
take
a
macro
to
save
my
money
for
what
little
extra
taste
you
get
from
this
beer
quite
drinkable
and
all
that
but
nothing
real
special
d
nice
i
could
easily
go
through
a
12er
great
session
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
smooth
and
mellow
brew
whose
only
downfall
is
a
lack
of
concentration
the
brew
comes
off
a
bit
watery
overall
but
the
flavors
present
do
compose
a
pleasant
brew
all
in
all
not
a
bad
effort
but
for
full
disclosure
its
the
only
honey
beer
ive
tried
a
clearish
copper
brew
with
a
fizzy
tan
head
nose
has
some
grainy
malts
and
some
artificial
honey
sweetness
the
clove
honey
seems
to
cover
up
most
flavors
a
light
body
heavy
with
carbonation
a
drinkable
brew
but
needs
either
less
honey
or
stronger
malts
and
hops
honey
beer
seems
to
be
the
big
thing
i
have
been
trying
some
different
honey
beers
of
course
this
one
being
a
macro
brew
i
wasnt
really
impressed
poured
a
pure
honey
color
or
maybe
i
just
had
honey
on
the
brain
smelled
faintly
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
honey
taste
is
bitey
with
minimal
hop
balance
and
some
honey
a
little
malty
i
dont
think
winnie
the
pooh
will
go
crazy
over
this
one
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
a
touch
sweet
for
my
taste
but
that
is
what
they
were
after
i
suppose
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
almost
soapy
drinkability
is
good
especially
at
4
5
abv
but
the
sweetness
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
very
many
of
these
at
one
sitting
poured
a
nice
three
finger
head
which
quickly
dissipated
nice
light
amber
color
smell
is
hops
and
a
sweetness
honey
or
malt
cant
really
tell
this
was
a
blast
from
the
past
i
remember
this
from
the
early
90s
in
pa
at
the
time
this
beer
was
in
all
of
the
bars
kind
of
a
step
up
from
coors
light
and
miller
lite
an
above
average
beer
versus
bmc
but
not
something
i
would
revist
or
seek
out
to
purchase
drinkability
for
what
it
is
it
is
one
of
the
better
macro
brews
and
for
only
4
396
pack
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
brew
clean
smooth
refreshing
probably
a
good
session
beer
but
its
not
gonna
find
a
permanent
home
in
my
fridge
that
being
said
i
would
not
rule
out
the
possibility
of
a
return
visit
or
two
on
a
side
note
it
was
definitely
a
great
beer
for
the
price
8
for
a
12pack
at
meijer
a
michiganarea
grocery
store
seems
like
a
pretty
good
deal
this
beer
is
a
steal
perhaps
not
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
with
this
style
but
its
one
hell
of
a
bargain
so
im
sure
itll
find
its
way
back
into
my
fridge
again
soon
you
can
find
it
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
for
7
50
a
12
pack
while
i
dont
recall
this
one
ever
being
a
top
of
the
line
brew
i
certainly
do
recall
it
being
far
better
than
this
it
was
at
least

no

face
it
is
a

beer
and
very

as
well
the
taste
is
even

than
the

i
keep
sipping
hoping
i
will
find
something
from
a
12
oz
bottle
costing
1

at
safeway
in
eureka
ca
this
poured
a
very
clear
amber
that
seemed
more
like
apple
cider
than
beer
very
little
head
and
virtually
no
lacing
nose
of
light
hops
and
s
little
sweetness
not
much
finish
in
spite
of
this
it
was
drinkable
ive
been
glancing
at
this
beer
for
a
while
now
at
my
local
grocery
store
and
when
it
went
on
sale
i
thought
eh
what
the
hell
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
it
overall
it
pours
fairly
well
at
best
it
has
a
clear
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
almost
no
bitterness
or
hop
flavor
but
still
a
strong
honey
taste
to
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
almost
like
a
light
beer
color
is
a
nice
goldenbrown
aroma
is
malty
and
has
undertones
of
honey
sweetness
flavor
is
good
malty
with
strong
hint
of
honey
no
bitterness
or
hop
component
smooth
not
complex
but
refreshing
and
tasty
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
party
or
to
have
with
dinner
really
nothing
special
here
its
very
sweet
w
honey
flavors
almost
giving
it
a
candy
like
taste
also
a
little
too
carbonated
feel
for
my
liking
you
can
see
right
through
this
beer
no
smell
really
slight
lingering
honey
taste
low
carbonation
good
lawn
mowing
beer
not
a
bad
taste
after
burping
good
session
beer
others
were
right
it
does
coat
the
tongue
a
little
have
at
it
crisp
refreshing
light
beer
d
very
drinkable
tastes
pretty
good
overall
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
since
it
is
so
light
d
i
guess
its
ok
not
a
lot
of
flavour
but
certainly
easy
to
drink
one
of
more
than
one
i
dunno
overall
this
is
about
average
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
havent
had
this
in
a
few
years
and
its
still
the
same
very
smooth
one
of
the
smoothest
ever
and
very
sweet
and
not
hoppy
at
all
which
i
personally
like
very
nice
reddishbrown
color
and
a
nice
malty
smell
to
it
i
like
this
brew
alot
so
smoooth
as
i
said
and
not
hoppy
at
all
i
dont
even
think
there
are
hops
in
this
thats
ok
though
beer
is
not
about
all
hops
there
are
many
other
characteristics
to
consider
and
this
is
a
good
one
sorry
i
havent
had
this
in
so
long
but
it
came
in
the
brewmasters
sampler
and
im
glad
one
of
my
fav
in
the
variety
pack
i
can
see
why
this
got
medals
one
must
not
be
a
hophead
if
youre
gonna
try
this
one
must
be
a
malthead
or
lagerhead
give
it
a
try
and
you
wont
be
sorry
again
dont
expect
the
hops
though
theres
no
bitterness
whatsoever

the

forming

the

is
a

with

i
can

noncraft

drinkers
enjoying
this
brew
because
this
reminds
me
of
a
bud
light
with
a
shot
of
honey
added
not
horrible
but
definitely
something
that
i
wont
be
buying
again
certainly
drinkable
and
almost
sessionable
although
this
would
likely
be
boring
session
fare
would
be
a
good
beer
for
getting
a
macro
swill
drinker
to
try
something
with
a
little
more
colour
than
piss
yellow
pretty
run
of
the
mill
brew
theres
a
lot
of
better
beers
out
there
and
as
such
ill
probably
never
buy
this
again
that
said
it
was
nice
to
try
it
da
this
seems
to
really
drop
in
quality

smells
of

sweet

flavor
with
hints
of
roasted

dominate
the
flavor
with
strong
notes
of
cooked

not
particularly
appetizing
watery
mouthfeel
which
doesnt
actually
help
the
drinkability
much
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
was
hoping
that
the
honeysweetness
would
be
a
little
more
prevalent
in
the
taste

although
worth
a
try
comments
i
drank
this
as
an
offhand
to
a
guinness
the
other
day
and
the
honey
sweetness
was
brought
out
a
lot
more
drinkability
not
great
not
bad
this
was
what
i
drank
as
a
kid
when
i
wanted
something
upscale
looks
pretty
good
with
a
nice
amber
color
smell
is
of
honey
and
some
sweet
caramel
malt
a
hint
of
roastiness
is
present
i
dont
like
much
as
far
as
nonmalthop
additions
to
beer
but
i
do
like
honey
this
is
moderately
sweet
from
the
malt
and
honey
but
not
much
going
on
to
bring
balance
not
totally
out
of
whack
though
relatively
light
in
body
and
mouthfeel
hops
are
pretty
much
undetectable
at
4
5
drinkability
is
good
but
not
complex
enough
to
drink
much
of
it
these
days
also
can
become
cloying
bleagh
the
worst
beer
in
the
dundee
lineup
eric
overall
not
a
bad
drinker
reminds
me
of
my
college
days
upstate
a
very
popular
beer
for
many
that
represents
a
baptism
into
fuller
and
more
robust
drinking
not
bad
for
what
it
is
basically
this
beer
is
good
because
its
cheap
and
an
alternative
to
your
run
of
the
mill
american
light
lager
as
plain
as
this
beer
is
in
the
drinking
department
i
have
found
it
to
taste
wonderful
when
cooked
with
brats
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
honey
taste
in
a
beer
but
it
really
adds
flavor
to
the
bratwurst
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
id
really
get
excited
about
pours
out
a
golden
honey
no
shit
color
with
a
thinnish
head
that
leaves
some
scattered
lacing
smells
grainy
and
honestly
its
hard
to
pick
out
much
else
lot
of
sweetness
in
the
nose
too
flavor
is
pretty
much
grain
honey
and
a
metallic
twang
not
much
else
faint
hint
of
rubber
bands
too
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
fizzy
im
not
impressed
with
this
how
the
hell
did
i
used
to
drink
this
give
me
a
high
life
over
this
any
day
at
least
high
life
doest
have
this
cloying
sweetness
overall
i
was
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
somebodygive
me
one
or
some
d
if
i
werent
so
restless
and
always
loving
so
many
other
beers
this
would
suffice
as
standard
homestock
and
for
as
many
as
you
want
nothing
detracting
or
unappealing
and
for
the
price
its
a
nice
standard
to
keep
on
hand
for
when
the
great
stuff
runs
out
eh
looks
okay
when
poured
smells
slightly
sweet
the
flavor
is
pretty
one
dimensional
slightly
sweet
malty
flavor
that
finishes
dry
not
my
favorite
beer
although
there
was
a
time
when
i
did
consume
quite
a
few
of
these
not
something
id
pick
up
again
unless
i
was
in
a
bind
d
not
tasty
and
so
not
drinkablility
poured
a
warm
golden
colour
with
a
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dwindled
to
half
the
lacing
was
consistent
and
even
lots
of
malt
flavours
in
the
front
with
just
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
creamy
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
despite
being
massproduced
and
easy
to
locate
remains
an
excellent
choice
should
definately
be
categorized
as
lighter
fare
though
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
nothing
horrible
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
avise
against
it

a

sweeter
than
i
expected
but
not
bad
moderate

with
sodacarbonation
easy
drinking
at

but
gets
a

artificially
so
still
not

poured
a

color
two
finger
off

faded
quickly
to
just
the
beer
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of

just
a
macro
corn
aroma
could
not
taste
the
honey
just
some
sweet
malt
very
blah
mouthfeel
light
and
carbonation
was
ok
not
something
i
would
buy
again
drinkable
and
unoffensive
takes
no
risks
there
is
one
good
reason
to
get
this
beer
the
price
drinkability
goes
down
pretty
easy
although
might
be
a
little
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
this
is
surely
a
sessionable
beer
and
at
around
5
for
a
6pack
why
not
plus
who
knows
maybe
you
will
open
up
someone
elses
eyes
to
the
potential
of
beer
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
great
aftertaste
im
sad
my
local
distibutor
stopped
carrying
it
but
theres
plenty
of
other
places
to
buy
it
i
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
it
was
really
very
pleasant
possibly
a
bit
one
dimensional
with
the
honey
but
it
works
quirky
d
a
less
than
average
beer
but
better
than
some
honey
brews
give
me
the
sam
adams
honey
porter
any
day
over
this
one
though
would
not
classify
this
as
an
american
amber
it
is
more
like
a
dark
lager
with
honey
however
very
drinkable
good
session
beer
with
some
taste
to
it
looks
like
nothing
and
smells
well
not
the
best
has
some
nice
caramel
flavor
to
it
and
goes
down
extremely
smooth
a
low
end
micro
but
it
is
a
micro
and
deserves
some
attention
easy
to
drink
if
your
choices
are
limited
otherwise
id
try
something
else
overall
not
bad
just
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
appearance
is
a
dark
lemon
with
a
minimal
head
smell
is
very
light
slight
malt
presence
taste
is
sweet
light
honey
notes
almost
cloying
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
syrupy
which
enhances
the
cloying
effect
yet
the
smoothness
of
the
brew
helps
drinkaability
it
may
be
a
good
introduction
for
a
bmc
drinker
but
its
not
much
better
dvery
drinkable
you
could
have
five
in
a
row
but
its
because
its
such
a
boring
beer
not
a
bad
beer
has
a
nice
golden
color
on
the
pour
the
smell
is
not
all
that
impressive
smells
like
a
beer
out
a
of
a
dirty
30
case
however
the
taste
is
quite
nice
the
honeylike
taste
is
quite
obvious
great
drinkability
a
cold
one
of
these
goes
down
real
smooth
but
overall
not
a
really
impressive
beer
but
it
is
something
i
could
drink
again
and
again
a
bit
over
priced
though
cheers
jdundees
brown
has
a
noticable
honeyness
obviously
it
is
light
for
the
style
both
in
taste
and
in
abv
i
personally
think
theres
something
wrong
with
being
able
to
down
12
brown
ales
and
still
walk
a
straight
line
but
the
taste
of
this
brew
isnt
all
bad
there
is
an
early
toasty
malt
flavor
with
a
little
grainyearthy
bitterness
due
to
faint
hops
or
slight
out
of
balance
flavor
at
the
finish
this
needs
even
more
flavor
and
sweetness
especially
early
on
while
being
thin
comes
off
ok
in
the
flavor
but
far
from
satisfying
for
the
style
anyway
an
average
accessible
american
brown
with
less
distinctiveness
and
flavor
than
most
in
this
style
but
ultimately
high
on
the
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
could
get
before
the
change
of
laws
a
little
over
a
year
ago
it
might
also
be
a
reason
i
rarely
drank
beer
until
recently
not
much
in
the
way
of
smell
and
appearance
is
typical
of
the
style
much
like
yeunglueng
but
sweeter
i
seem
to
taste
mostly
adjunct
this
seems
to
be
a
sweet
corn
beer
i
get
only
cloying
sweetness
in
the
finish
could
use
some
more
hops
to
even
this
beer
out
definately
a
step
above
macros
though
cheers
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
this
was
one
of
my
first
baby
steps
towards
craft
beer
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
a
move
in
the
right
direction
for
the
bmc
crowd
thats
scared
to
try
something
that
isnt
piss
yellow
well
i
thought
this
particular
beer
smelled
a
lot
better
than
it
tasted
and
looked
i
poured
it
into
a
clear
class
and
it
reminded
me
of
applejuice
it
had
very
little
head
and
no
lace
what
so
ever
it
really
smelled
sweet
and
its
taste
wasnt
too
bad
it
has
a
pretty
crisp
after
taste
but
not
much
flavor
i
can
see
why
people
would
recommend
this
to
a
nonbeer
or
starting
beer
drinker
what
i
dont
like
is
that
theres
a
very
definite
funky
aftertaste
that
just
tastes
cheap
the
beer
pours
a
very
nice
gold
with
some
nice
red
hue
unfortunately
its
head
recedes
to
quickly
but
the
lacing
is
okay
the
only
real
smell
is
the
big
malt
sweetness
but
a
fresh
honey
smell
does
make
a
slight
appearance
at
the
end
the
taste
is
also
only
big
on
some
malt
sweetness
the
only
honey
comes
at
the
end
in
the
form
of
a
grainy
honey
comb
taste
sourness
rounds
it
out
the
mouthfeel
is
good
slightly
thick
and
very
smooth
however
it
is
a
little
bubble
and
will
sting
the
recesses
of
your
mouth
due
to
the
sourness
and
bubbles
the
drinkabilty
isnt
great
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
foamy
white
head
smell
is
of
honey
suprise
and
malt
taste
is
very
similar
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
besides
honey
and
some
malt
a
bit
better
than
most
macros
great
beer
for
the
price
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
somewhat
watered
down
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
nothing
amazing
but
goes
with
just
about
anything
worth
trying
a
great
cheap
beer
enjoy
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
clear
and
very
light
amber
in
color
beer
has
a
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
of
honey
and
malt
the
taste
is
equally
sweet
but
not
too
overpowering
a
wonderfully
smooth
finish
the
bottle
says
extra
smooth
and
this
is
no
lie
the
mouthfeel
is
light
kinda
watery
and
very
carbonated
overall
i
definitely
think
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
better
than
your
average
amber
macro
this
beer
wasnt
as
bad
as
other
reviewers
made
it
seem
not
too
bad
at
all
not
something
id
look
for
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
this
lager
pours
a
clear
and
clean
honey
color
with
a
head
that
is
very
light
and
airy
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
also
very
light
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
that
you
barley
notice
and
almost
no
hops
presence
at
all
this
brew
was
too
watery
and
for
my
personal
taste
it
needs
more
character
thank
you
honey
brown
for
making
me
curious
as
to
what
the
beer
world
has
to
offer
and
thank
you
for
being
just
the
right
beer
i
was
looking
for
at
that
time
ill
never
forget
you
old
friend
a
solid
and
excellent
lager
for
the
price
this
is
quite
drinkable
but
not
very
complex
or
interesing
a
very
average
beer
all
around
below
average
i
guess
its
about
what
i
expected
but
even
at
less
than
five
bucks
a
sixer
i
can
probably
do
better
not
offensive
but
not
good
either
not
recommended
i
was
yet
to
try
this
brew
i
bought
it
one
night
after
i
got
out
of
work
i
was
suprised
at
the
taste
i
was
expecting
a
real
sweet
beer
but
i
was
wrong
it
is
only
slightly
sweet
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
it
held
a
head
fairly
well
the
color
was
on
the
dark
yellow
almost
orange
i
recommend
you
try
it
i
was
impressed
md
very
spritzy
on
the
mouthfeel
thin
slightly
metallic
at
the
back
but
not
horrible
yet
this
is
the
least
impressive
honeyflavoured
beer
ive
had
fullstop
pours
a
clear
goldenamber
color
with
a
white
head
that
is
quickly
reduced
to
a
thin
lace
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
honey
taste
is
rather
thin
and
watery
taste
is
sweet
toasted
malt
with
not
much
hops
to
help
balance
this
brew
out
this
actually
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
overall
this
brew
is
lacking
in
so
many
ways
i
am
disappointed
with
the
honey
brown
after
trying
their
pale
ale
which
wasnt
bad
tasted
072806
d
well
i
tried
routing
for
the
home
team
rochester
ny
but
you
let
me
down
again
nothing
but
genesee
with
a
tux
made
of
honey
light
brown
color
basicly
no
head
no
lacing
scent
has
hints
of
honey
and
light
hop
smell
taste
is
pretty
disapointing
basicly
no
honey
taste
has
a
slightly
sweet
after
taste
but
nothing
that
i
would
call
a
honey
flavor
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
light
easy
to
drink
because
it
is
so
light
in
taste
not
too
expensive
a
good
party
beer
but
not
good
for
anything
else
get
my
buzz
on
y
session
i
do
not
know
what
the
brewer
is
trying
to
do
here
whatever
it
is
he
has
failed
to
impress
me
more
honey
colored
than
brown
with
a
typical
jwd
shortlived
fizzy
head
sweet
candied
malt
taste
masking
bitterness
and
what
little
carbonation
there
is
thin
buttery
mouthfeel
and
rather
flat
honey
is
detectable
but
theres
not
a
lot
of
other
complexity
there
not
all
that
exciting
if
my
only
choices
were
this
or
a
macro
id
go
with
this
probably
a
good
beer
to
get
your
bud
drinking
friends
to
try
to
help
them
crossover
to
other
choices
for
the
price
its
pretty
good
and
a
huge
step
up
from
budweiser
or
miller
but
this
is
by
no
means
a
great
beer
id
have
rather
bought
killians
honestly
good
beer
for
what
it
is
this
was
one
of
the
nonmacro
beers
that
i
tried
i
was
more
impressed
by
it
back
then
this
is
a
good
crossover
ber
for
those
who
want
to
explore
outside
of
their
bmc
world
im
having
this
beer
just
right
now
the
honey
taste
is
light
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
but
if
i
was
in
bar
i
would
not
ask
for
a
beer
this
sweet
is
good
if
you
are
just
having
one
i
really
like
the
color
of
this
beer
is
like
dark
gold
but
not
to
dark
for
my
taste
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
12
beige
head
over
the
crystal
clear
light
amber
brew
head
fades
slowly
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
grain
with
a
light
hoppiness
taste
is
also
sweet
malts
upfront
possibly
too
much
again
with
a
lightly
hoppy
character
and
both
flavors
linger
after
swallowing
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
okay
limited
by
the
sweetness
somewhat
not
bad
for
an
aluminum
offering
for
those
places
that
shun
glass
but
not
much
else
would
draw
me
back
d
at
4
5
alcohol
its
ok
if
youre
out
and
youre
drinking
for
volume
its
not
a
terribly
refreshing
beer
though
so
its
not
much
of
a
lawnmower
beer
first
glass
went
down
easy
i
recall
from
college
that
the
sweetness
isnt
nearly
as
pleasurable
on
subsequent
glasses
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
appearance
was
medium
brown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
has
hints
of
malt
but
very
faint
flavor
was
okay
but
lost
in
the
thin
body
which
in
turn
led
to
a
watery
lessthan
memorable
finish
not
much
to
this
beer
overall
an
average
beer
nothing
ground
breaking
but
quite
drinkable
although
it
gets
a
little
sweet
towards
the
end
worth
a
try
d
as
a
previous
reviewer
mentioned
jw
dundees
continues
to
prove
that
qualty
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
expensive
for
8
99
a
12pack
what
a
great
deal
dif
had
no
other
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
otherwise
id
switch
small
amount
of
head
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
quickly
fades
to
an
incomplete
layer
of
head
dark
yellow
not
quite
brown
smell
is
very
faint
an
indication
of
the
flavor
not
too
much
flavor
i
recall
from
my
yesteryears
that
this
beer
was
dominated
by
the
taste
of
honey
but
now
its
not
so
prominant
as
i
recall
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
special
though
i
bought
a
jw
dundee
sampler
pack
ready
to
try
something
else
this
is
a
pretty
boring
beer
on
second
thought
theres
quite
a
bit
of
honey
taste
but
not
as
much
as
eureka
wheat
honey
ale
i
bought
a
22ounce
bottle
of
this
beer
today
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
it
isnt
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
being
not
bad
just
undistinguished
color
is
a
nice
deep
ambergold
head
is
loose
and
foamy
dissipates
fast
very
little
odor
faintly
cardboardy
taste
id
drink
jwd
honey
brown
if
it
was
the
only
beer
available
say
at
a
picnic
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
on
a
regular
basis
a
good
beer
gimme
their
amber
lager
or
pale
ale
over
this
offering
but
still
quite
good
nothing
harsh
or
challenging
about
this
beer
at
all
on
the
boring
side
of
the
beer
divide
useful
as
a
transition
beer
but
really
too
light
for
a
bas
taste
buds
this
one
was
given
to
me
as
a
part
of
a
mixed
gift
pack
and
was
not
one
i
had
picked
up
intentionally
before
for
a
beer
called
honey
brown
this
poured
out
a
very
pale
and
fizzy
which
was
understandable
as
it
was
just
a
lager
it
looked
pretty
good
with
a
one
finger
head
despite
the
label
misnomer
not
much
going
on
aromatically
except
some
cleanly
grainy
smell
and
a
faint
touch
of
honey
the
honey
was
more
evident
in
the
taste
and
was
followed
by
some
green
apple
sourness
and
a
hint
of
spice
not
unpleasant
just
very
very
bland
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
mouth
after
the
first
taste
either
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
a
pleasant
surprise
but
this
wasnt
it
da
nil
drinkability
a
little
to
light
textured
for
me
to
enjoy
a
few
at
a
time
but
i
could
probably
down
a
few
like
water
if
i
had
to
i
dont
know
what
situation
would
force
me
to
down
this
stuff
like
water
and
im
not
too
interested
in
finding
out
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
half
inch
white
head
smells
is
of
some
malt
slight
adjunct
and
artificial
honey
like
smell
mildly
malty
taste
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
no
hops
taste
a
little
thin
with
a
tad
bit
of
honey
flavor
that
helps
the
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
light
a
decent
brew
just
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
quick
and
easy
though
id
buy
it
over
most
macros
picked
up
12
of
these
for
9
pourded
into
a
mug
the
appearance
is
pretty
standard
like
its
name
its
honeycolored
with
only
a
slight
bubbly
thin
white
head
sweet
starchy
smell
a
bit
of
corn
comes
through
the
taste
is
solid
reminds
me
of
a
bud
with
a
little
sweetness
to
it
you
can
detect
the
honey
mouthfeel
is
fine
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
tho
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
perfect
with
chips
or
a
burgerhot
dog
on
a
summer
day
if
youre
tired
of
bud
the
like
but
dont
want
to
sway
too
far
away
from
it
this
might
be
the
one
for
you
drinks
okay
but
to
sweet
to
drink
more
than
2
folks
who
like
sweet
or
bland
will
enjoy
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
said
previously
that
this
tastes
a
lot
like
honey
and
thats
true
its
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
i
probably
wont
this
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
smallish
white
head
the
smell
is
very
lightalmost
no
smell
with
a
little
sweet
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
like
any
large
macro
lager
beer
lightcrisp
and
very
little
taste
the
mf
is
lightweak
and
watery
i
really
cant
imagine
ever
having
this
again
overall
impression
highly
drinkable
but
certainly
not
an
exciting
beer
this
is
a
good
gateway
beer
and
cheap
enough
to
buy
in
bulk
for
the
bmc
crowd
d
drinkable
not
too
bad
ive
had
worse
would
not
buy
again
though
considering
the
price
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
if
im
looking
for
an
inexpensive
alternative
there
are
other
cheap
beers
that
id
prefer
you
either
like
or
you
dont
like
my
guess
is
that
the
more
different
beers
you
have
tasted
the
less
you
will
like
honey
brown
lager
overall
this
is
just
above
average
i
think
it
succeeds
in
being
a
cheaper
beer
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
similarly
priced
brews
opinion
well
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
by
any
means
the
malt
bill
was
out
of
balance
the
water
seems
off
for
the
style
the
carbonation
is
too
low
need
i
go
on
it
gets
rather
unpleasant
as
it
warms
and
one
that
i
doubt
i
will
drink
again
drinkability
definetely
drinkable
goes
down
like
a
cola
one
of
my
favorite
up
and
coming
beers
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
strait
pint
glass
looks
amber
but
very
light
you
can
smell
the
honey
and
also
a
typical
brown
ale
smell
sweet
taste
right
from
the
beggining
first
thought
is
that
this
beer
should
be
served
cold
out
of
my
beer
fridge
it
was
around
52
f
i
think
it
would
be
better
served
like
a
macro
lager
at
38
f
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
nutty
over
carbonation
is
the
next
feeling
im
not
saying
i
dislike
this
beer
just
that
it
needs
some
major
improvement
i
dont
think
you
could
drink
very
many
of
these
unless
you
were
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
even
then
there
are
better
alternatives
out
there
notes
drank
a
lot
in
college
and
it
helped
me
to
understand
that
beer
could
have
flavor
i
now
see
that
it
had
very
little
flavor
enjoyable
enough
to
be
refreshing
definitely
worth
the
price
3
996
but
i
would
rather
spent
3x
as
much
and
get
a
better
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
medium
amber
color
with
modeest
white
head
smell
is
on
the
sweet
side
honey
and
while
different
not
especially
appealling
taste
is
more
sweetness
but
the
honey
notes
are
somewhat
enjoyable
finish
is
more
sweetness
which
begins
to
get
a
bit
tiring
not
your
average
beer
but
may
be
more
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
drinkability
for
the
price
you
cant
go
wrong
it
has
sort
of
the
same
taste
as
bud
light
but
with
more
flavor
and
of
cource
a
tad
of
honey
for
half
the
cost
brew
pours
to
a
deep
golden
color
that
hedges
on
amber
has
a
nice
sized
off
white
head
that
has
some
retention
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
sweat
quality
to
it
that
seems
to
dominate
causing
any
malt
aromas
to
be
wellhidden
or
even
non
existent
the
taste
is
pretty
good
does
have
a
sweat
characteristic
but
it
is
not
too
much
for
me
do
notice
some
malt
flavors
but
even
though
they
do
come
out
in
the
taste
they
still
seem
quite
hidden
the
feel
is
very
fresh
and
crisp
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
probably
my
least
favorite
in
the
dundee
offering
but
a
old
favorite
from
college
days
long
past
over
all
a
fair
brew
the
only
other
honey
lager
i
have
had
is
youngs
waggledance
and
comparatively
speaking
that
is
much
better
but
this
beer
is
really
not
all
that
bad
if
they
ironed
out
the
burning
sensation
it
gives
your
mouth
this
would
be
an
aboveaverage
beer
in
my
book
im
acually
surprised
as
how
i
dont
hate
this
beer
its
total
macroswill
but
for
macroswill
its
half
decent
its
close
to
yeungling
and
saranac
although
a
few
notches
behind
blue
point
imho
however
for
8
79
a
twelve
its
good
value
and
great
for
game
day
or
another
event
when
you
have
to
host
and
want
to
appeal
to
everyone
not
just
your
beer
snob
buddies
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
decent
head
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
aroma
is
mild
not
a
real
lot
there
taste
is
pretty
decent
for
a
lager
beer
i
like
the
touch
of
honey
makes
for
a
fairly
quaffable
beer
this
is
probably
a
decent
beer
to
introduce
macro
drinkers
to
craft
beer
i
couldnt
drink
too
much
too
sweet
overall
this
is
pretty
much
just
an
eh
beer
for
me
its
nothing
that
tastes
fantastic
but
its
a
nice
solid
brew
that
i
could
probably
drink
several
of
if
the
need
ever
arose
rogues
american
amber
is
miles
better
though
pours
an
ultraclear
light
golden
color
fizzy
two

head
dissapears
quickly
but
leaves
fair

massive
amount
of
fastmoving

bubbles
rising
to
the
top
honeyish
and
light
malt
aromas
pretty
clean
pale
malt
sweetness
and
a
nutrasweet
fake
honey
taste
hops
attempt
to
make
an
impact
on
aftertaste
but
there
is
almost
no
bittter
in
this
unblanced
and
offsweet
brew
light
body
and
champagnelike
carbonation
prevents
the
offflavors
from
turning
slick
but
the
finish
is
residual
with
artificial
sweetness
and
the
resulting
drinkability
is
low
from
the
bottle
poured
a
honey
with
a
white
head
that
left
no
lacing
aroma
nutty
malts
just
a
slight
hint
of

some

what
there
was
odf
it
got
nuttyness
malts
sweetness
could
only
get
small
hints
of
honey
out
of
this
bottle
and
thats
all
folks
i
guess
for
the
price
might
make
a
session
beer
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
and
wasnt
thrilled
with
the
result
light
brownish
yellow
clear
with
no

lots
of
carbonation
beer
is
almost
clear
at
the
edges
smell
is
hard
candy
sweet
over
a
watery
malt
base
looks
suspiciously
like
an
iced
tea
at
this
point
taste
is
sweet
nearly
cloying
with
a
crispiness
that
doesnt
quite
save
the
day
here
light
body
yes
you
can
drink
it
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
the
color
of
the
beer
is
dull
brown
with
a
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
little
foam
the
whole
way
down
but
does
not
leave
any
lace
it
smells
mostly
of
some
barley
malt
with
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
the
taste
does
not
reveal
much
that
the
taste
does
not
there
is
an
average
thickness
and
carbonation
overally
this
beer
does
not
bring
enough
to
the
table
to
be
considered
all
that
great
three
of
these
came
in
a
sampler
12
pack
along
with
the
amber
lager
pale
ale
and
the
new
special
edition
festive
ale
pours
a
dark
amber
color
a
thick
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
not
very
much
in
the
aroma
department
besides
a
mild
sweetness
taste
is
thin
and
weak
with
a
little
too
much
sweetness
for
me
there
is
a
place
for
this
beer
just
not
in
my
fridge
i
like
this
beer
but
it
isnt
anything
special
the
honey
taste
is
slightly
noticeable
but
the
beer
is
much
more
enjoyable
after
drinking
a
more
bitter
beer
as
the
honey
then
jumps
out
that
said
jw
dundees
product
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
for
the
price
range
in
fact
honey
brown
is
unquestionably
superior
to
the
big
3
macros
so
you
have
no
excuse
to
be
buying
them
if
you
see
this
on
the
shelves
poured
an
amberbrownish
color
with
a
small
head
of
white
foam
that
dissipated
fast
that
left
no
rings
or
lace
whatsoever
it
didnt
have
much
of
an
aroma
except
for
some
grains
in
a
sweet
background
the
taste
was
like
the
smell
grainy
with
a
little
bit
of
sweet
honey
in
the
background
at
one
time
i
noticed
some
hops
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
very
average
light
and
easily
drinkable
basically
a
cheap
above
average
beer
and
would
make
a
nice
substitute
when
the
bar
has
nothing
but
macros
pours
a
clear
light
brownish
amber
with
a
small
slight
offwhite
foamy
quickly
diminishing
head
the
smell
is
of
sweet
grainy
malts
very
light
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
doughy
yeast
the
taste
is
mostly
grain
with
some
cooked
veggie
in
there
too
and
it
rather
sweet
as
it
heads
toward
the
finish
the
finish
is
short
and
very
lightly
dry
with
a
touch
of
honey
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
lightly
oily
texture
and
lively
carbonation
nothing
special
but
quite
drinkable
i
was
always
happy
to
see
this
on
tap
at
college
parties
but
considering
what
they
would
normally
have
can
you
blame
me
because
it
was
a
little
heavier
that
the
average
kegger
beer
but
smoother
too
while
not
that
complex
or
interesting
the
honey
flavor
sweetness
drinkabilty
and
even
the
price
make
this
a
great
brew
to
use
when
introducing
bmc
drinkers
to
the
craft
beer
scene
recommended
smooth
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
average
not
much
carbonation
in
this
beer
and
it
is
light
on
the
palate
it
also
goes
down
easily
you
could
drink
this
all
night
with
no
problems
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
i
dont
think
that
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
really
wouldnt
buy
it
again
unless
i
had
no
other
better
options
but
you
dont
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
overall
ok
for
a
specialty
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
worth
a
try
if
youre
intererested
in
this
style
or
want
to
show
a
macro
drinker
what
else
is
out
there
it
is
relatively
inexpensive
i
paid
5
85
for
a
sixer
overall
a
very
decent
and
underrated
beer
its
really
not
that
bad
for
the
price
and
i
enjoy
the
honey
flavor
once
in
a
while
nice
golden
color
one
inch
head
slowly
goes
into
a
nice
lace
lightbut
not
watery
good
flavor
with
a
slight
sweet
edge
smooth
finishmakes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
has
been
a
beer
of
choice
for
me
lately
good
pricefull
flavor
i
recommend
this
beer
notes
personally
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
however
its
cheap
really
really
cheap
you
can
pick
up
a
12
of
this
for
less
than
a
12
of
bud
at
yankee
spirits
this
is
probably
a
good
beer
to
use
if
youre
trying
to
turn
a
friend
on
to
better
beer
taste
is
very
surprising
good
sweetness
not
overpowering
at
all
nice
honey
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
round
midlevel
carbonation
very
nice
change
of
pace
and
very
easy
to
drink
good
beer
at
a
great
price
the
kicker
on
the
drinkability
is
that
it
is
7
50
for
a
12
pack
yes
easily
one
of
the
top
beers
in
this
price
range
also
i
got
a
14
barrel
of
this
over
the
summer
and
it
was
even
tastier
on
tap
pours
a
pale
amber
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
honey
brown
with
a
minimal
white
head
smell
is
a
little
adjuncty
with
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
of
a
standard
macro
lager
with
some
honey
sweetness
aftertaste
is
corn
and
a
little
metallic
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
body
is
medium
overall
a
slightly
sweet
slightly
more
tolerable
macro
lager
better
than
anything
bmc
for
sure
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
smell
is
almost
not
there
very
faint
there
is
a
mild
sweetness
and
some
flowery
wafts
of
something
the
taste
is
slightly
tangy
with
a
mild
amount
of
hops
it
is
mainly
fruity
with
hints
of
oranges
and
honey
the
beer
is
mildly
refreshing
and
very
smooth
almost
watery
in
the
mouthfeel
especially
the
aftertaste
drinkability
i
usually
take
a
long
time
drinking
my
beers
giving
me
lots
of
little
sips
and
lots
of
time
to
savor
i
didnt
do
that
here
i
wanted
to
taste
the
honey
and
the
revitalizing
texture
not
that
i
chugged
it
but
i
took
it
in
quicker
than
usual
i
could
drink
this
with
many
meals
i
could
drink
this
again
right
now
at
its
reasonable
price
this
is
a
fairly
good
buy
pours

buh
the

its

it
light
slight

earthiness
in

tastes

and
a
little
souring
from
fermentation
may
have
a
little
diacityl
no
hop
aroma
or
flavor
leaves
this
beer
too
sweet
not
to
have
a
bigger
body
the
body
is
medium
and
slick
to
the

finishes
a
bit
too
barley
sweet
and
not
bittering

drying
in
the
finish
no
definate
alcohol
flavors
or
warmth
an
ok
beer
but
the
lack
of
balance
and
depth
keeps
me
from
drinking
more
its
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
its
ok
on
a
hot
summerday
and
heck
i
just
plain
like
it
for
the
good
memories
it
brings
to
mind
looks
really
nice
for
a
lager
an
eyecatching
golden
honeyish
color
honey
brown
isnt
a
bad
description
of
it
starts
with
a
big
soapy
head
but
that
doesnt
last
long
after
that
theres
no
lacing
of
which
to
speak
definitely
smells
honeyish
but
also
floral
and
perfumey
really
smells
like
a
honeyscented
perfume
the
only
initial
taste
is
malty
but
theres
a
hint
of
honey
on
the
finish
thats
nice
mouthfeel
is
limpid
im
not
convinced
that
theres
any
carbon
dioxide
in
this
beer
at
all
i
suppose
this
beer
hits
exactly
what
it
aims
for
which
is
a
malty
lager
with
a
hint
of
honey
any
more
honey
and
it
would
be
sickeningly
sweet
but
that
little
bit
of
honey
is
the
only
real
character
this
beer
has
a
cult
classic
and
a
decent
stepping
stone
from
macro
lagers
to
perhaps
craft
beer
one
day
ive
enjoyed
honey
brown
for
the
past
few
weeks
on
a
business
trip
to
chicago
its
a
bit
sweet
now
that
ive
acquired
a
taste
for
darker
and
heavier
beers
but
its
not
too
expensive
and
a
decent
beer
if
you
plan
on
having
a
few
its
available
in
central
illinois
grocery
stores
so
it
should
be
available
many
places
warning
dont
put
it
in
the
back
of
a
supercold
fridge
or
a
freezer
for
a
quickcool
the
beer
freezes
in
the
bottle
i
think
this
beer
for
the
price
is
one
of
the
top
notch
brews
in
that
price
range
the
honey
shines
through
although
it
leaves
a
slick
aftertaste
that
makes
it
tough
to
throw
down
more
than
3
or
so
at
a
time
the
aroma
has
a
slight
sweet
honey
and
sugar
fragarance
i
like
the
taste
i
can
remember
this
being
one
of
the
better
cheap
beers
available
when
i
was
in
college
i
notice
the
label
now
says
honey
flavored
lager
flavored
as
in
not
actually
brewed
with
as
in
no
bees
went
hungry
so
you
can
drink
this
stuff
because
theres
very
much
of
a
honey
flavor
almost
an
artificial
one

this
beer

their

the

ahh
it

a

and
smells
sorta
chemically
when
i

brown
ale
i
dont
think
of
this
it
isnt
brown
but
it
isnt
bad
the
mouthfeel

it
does
go
down
easy
a

weak

interesting
thing
to
note
this
stuff
actually
tastes
pretty
good
i
just
noticed
that
the
underside
of
my
bottlecap
says
sorry
try
again
make
a
better
beer
and
ill
consider
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
wispy
some
residual
sweetness
slightly
more
interesting
than
a
budcoorsmiller
but
not
enough
overall
a
very
average
beer
at
best
this
beer
is
a
step
up
for
macro
drinkers
but
not
much
of
one
this
beers
biggest
downfall
is
its
sweetness
and
rather
sickly
honey
character
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
certainly
not
recommended
bought
a
12
pack
on
sale
for
8
15
at
specs
liquors
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
after
a
few
it
seemed
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
appearance
is
a
nice
copper
color
definently
not
very
brown
but
not
bad
at
all
smell
is
mildly
sweet
alcohol
is
noted
smell
is
clean
but
nothing
great
taste
is
very
sweet
of
honey
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
not
bad
tasting
but
sweetness
became
tiresome
by
the
end
of
my
second
beer
luckily
the
sweetness
doesnt
last
very
long
after
finishing
a
sip
drinkability
is
pretty
good
especially
for
those
who
prefer
honey
flavor
dundees
honey
brown
seemed
very
filling
for
a
lager
though
but
i
think
it
might
be
just
the
sweetness
bothering
me
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
but
it
still
is
a
fairly
good
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
that
was
gone
rather
quickly
little
if
any
lace
to
speak
of
faint
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
taste
is
ok
some
malt
flavors
with
corn
and
rice
flavors
coming
through
some
honey
sweetness
and
minimal
hop
flavors
mouthfeel
is
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
a
decent
thirst
quencher
i
usually
always
have
some
in
the
fridge
and
offer
it
to
my
american
lager
drinking
friends
its
a
step
up
from
bud
a
small
one
but
sometimes
thats
all
it
takes
to
get
them
sarted
down
the
ba
road
a
ok
brew
that
most
people
enjoy
this
a
drinkable
beer
and
the
price
on
this
6
pack
is
great
not
an
amazing
beer
by
any
means
but
enjoyable
the
label
says
honey
flavored
lager
and
sure
enough
the
first
flavor
to
hit
my
palate
was
a
bit
of
honey
that
lingers
throughout
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
a
decent
thirst
quencher
but
certainly
not
a
world
class
beverage
rather
dull
with
little
redeeming
qualities
not
horrible
but
not
good
either
havent
had
one
of
these
since
high
school
and
now
i
know
why
pours
a
light
amber
color
a
slight
head
that
is
fairly
steady
throughout
but
almost
no
lacing
a
faint
aroma
is
present
somewhat
minty
and
a
touch
of
honey
the
taste
is
very
disappointing
theres
something
not
right
with
this
beer
and
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
almost
tastes
like
cardboard
a
very
mild
beer
that
is
disappointing
to
say
the
least
a
step
up
from
bud
coors
etc
but
not
recommended
id
take
these
over
budmillercoors
just
about
any
day
it
seems
to
go
rather
well
with
spicy
foods
this
stuff
is
pretty
ubiquitous
here
on
campus
the
price
was
1
25
per
draft
so
i
decided
to
try
it
received
this
beer
in
a
clear
plastic
cup
so
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
the
pour
was
an
amber
color
with
a
quickly
disappating
white
head
not
really
much
smell
to
this
one
flavor
was
subdued
but
there
was
a
little
bit
of
malty
sweetness
present
this
is
a
pretty
light
beer
its
nothing
special
but
then
again
its
not
god
awful
either
hmmm
just
to
note
there
is
a
pervasive
honey
flavor
throughout
this
beer
and
i
wonder
what
they
have
added
to
the
brew
to
get
that
flavor
anyway
the
rest
is
just
a
bland
pale
malt
character
a
bit
too
fizzy
and
not
much
character
grassy
and
crisp
lightbodied
not
a
bad
beer
but
does
not
distinguish
itself
either
if
it
had
not
been
left
in
my
fridge
after
a
bunch
of
guys
came
over
for
cards
i
probably
would
never
have
tried
it
and
i
sure
cant
see
trying
it
again
if
given
a
choice
a
macro
looking
head
white
and
fizzy
lace
looks
good
appearance
is
clear
and
barely
a
light
copper
amber
not
brown
smell
is
mild
and
a
bit
sweet
smells
like
a
macro
taste
is
smooth
and
perfectly
sweet
i
think
that
they
use
adjuncts
in
this
beer
that
is
what
the
smell
and
taste
is
telling
me
despite
all
of
this
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
seems
to
have
spawned
a
host
of
imitators
i
first
had
this
beer
at
the
anchor
bar
in
buffalo
while
wolfing
down
some
wings
it
tastes
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
this
isnt
an
overly
complex
beer
the
color
is
somewhere
between
amber
and
brown
the
taste
of
it
is
just
as
it
is
advertised
you
can
definitely
taste
the
honey
in
it
but
there
is
not
so
much
of
it
where
it
is
too
sweet
goes
down
easy
and
is
better
than
just
about
any
macrobrew
you
will
find
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
and
the
drinkability
was
low
i
had
difficulty
finishing
the

drinkability

this
is
definitely
not
one
that
id
buy
again
but
it
was
just
good
enough
to
keep
out
of
the
sink
picked
this
up
at
the
convenience
store
down
the
street
in
a
bomber
it
poured
a
light
copper
colour
with
a
moderate
to
thick
head
that
didnt
last
all
too
long
the
smell
was
semimalty
and
sweet
i
wouldnt
say
honey
sweet
but
it
was
sweet
the
taste
was
also
sweet
but
it
lacked
that
honey
taste
i
was
looking
for
it
also
had
a
malty
taste
i
will
drink
this
again
it
is
much
beter
than
any
of
the
other
macros
out
there
its
good
if
all
there
else
is
corona
bud
and
jw
dundees
i
dont
know
about
the
marketing
on
this
one
the
fake
australianbritish
name
pleasant
finish
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
too
bad

to

its
surprisingly
drinkable
and
yet
its
not
because
it
overwhelms
the
palate
after
more
than
two
servings
and
yet
you
could
continue
to
drink
it
because
theres
nothing
there
to
stop
you
probably
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
it
before

conclusion
believing
there
was
a
strong
possibility
my
memory
was
enhancing
this
beers
qualities
but
i
was
not
disappointed
its
still
a
respectable
brew

no

a

a

honey
flavored
lager
dogbrick
a
winner
in
my
book
slightly
dark
and
very
smooth
and
creamy
you
get
a
hint
of
honey
as
it
goes
down
with
a
little
bitterness
i
went
back
to
this
one
many
times
and
it
never
let
me
down
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
bery
enjoyable
on
tap
tonight
i
have
had
the
bottles
as
well
slighty
darker
than
yellow
to
light
brown
color
thin
faint
white
head
sweet
honey
smell
with
some
sourness
as
well
tasted
overly
sweet
with
a
serious
stale
sour
finish
didnt
get
much
malt
or
hop
balance
just
sourness
thin
feel
not
much
to
keep
you
drinking
more
i
remember
the
bottles
being
much
better
i
may
have
had
it
from
a
stale
keg
not
memorable
and
i
wont
buy
it
again
for
a
long
time
dark
copper
hue
clear
and
effervescent
the
head
settles
into
a
respectable
layer
that
coats
the
glass
sweet
caramel
malt
and
cooked
corn
in
aroma
and
not
much
else
lightly
bodied
from
the
copious
use
of
adjuncts
theres
a
one
dimensional
non
caramel
malt
derived
sweetness
in
flavor
that
is
quite
offputting
and
borderlines
of
being
cloying
malt
complexity
is
sorely
lacking
hop
bitterness
is
meager
and
thus
allows
for
the
sugary
sweetness
tastes
like
a
typical
macrobrew
w
sugar
added
mild
honey
flavors
emerge
in
the
finish
then
vanish
quickly
leaving
an
empty
blandness
honey
brown
is
not
an
enjoyable
beer
the
sweetness
is
cloying
and
tastes
processed
this
beer
makes
me
sick
maybe
i
just
dont
like
honey
beers
its
light
wood
color
with
thick
large
bubbled
head
smell
is
of
a
touch
of
sweetness
with
almost
a
bread
smell
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
mouthcoating
not
very
sweet
but
its
the
kind
of
sweet
that
makes
you
gag
i
can
never
finish
one
of
these
copper
color
very
white
head
thats
gone
at
about
25
seconds
there
might
be
a
slight
honey
in
the
aroma
otherwise
understated
sweet
smell
bottle
says
smooth
and
it
surely
is
smooth
to
the
point
of
zero
complexity
i
couldnt
detect
any
hops
anywhere
in
my
mouth
primary
impression
is
of
light
brown
sugar
surprisingly
thin
mouthfeel
while
at
the
same
time
a
little
gagging
in
the
throat
after
three
sips
or
so
i
suppose
this
is
drinkable
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
but
there
was
nothing
of
note
to
me
a
sweet
genny
that
made
its
way
west
from
lake
ontario
to
a
liquor
store
south
of
lake
superior
i
found
it
to
be
an
average
beer
to
drink
something
better
to
drink
then
the
budlights
etc
at
a
function
but
there
are
better
beers
out
there
of
this
type
it
poured
a
dark
yellow
color
and
formed
pratically
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
some
hops
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
hops
the
body
was
very
light
and
the
finish
hard
to
really
figure
out
original
another
beer
that
should
be
considered
the
baseline
for
a
regular
drink
it
smells
of
bread
and
honey
slightly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
another
brew
i
only
seem
to
see
in
college
towns
this
wasnt
too
bad
i
was
expecting
the
worst
figuring
the
honey
would
taste
like
an
afterthought
but
it
seemed
to
blend
in
nicely
with
the
beer
not
as
sweet
as
i
had
anticipated
either
decent
and
fairly
cheap
too
take
newcastle
and
water
it
down
and
lower
the
quality
just
a
bit
and
youve
got
hone
brown
not
a
bad
beer
though
a
very
pleasant
drinkable
beer
rather
slight
head
beautiful
dark
golden
brown
color
slightly
sweet
and
very
smooth
and
pleasant
no
aftertaste
at
all
easy
to
drink
unremarkable
but
nothing
to
offend
either
i
really
hate
this
beer
the
honey
flavor
puts
me
off
right
from
the
start
i
never
understood
why
this
beer
was
so
popular
when
it
first
starting
getting
hit
the
shelves
in
pa
if
ice
cold
it
is
still
bad
but
gets
way
worse
as
it
warms
up
i
can
barely
choke
one
bottle
down
the
only
thing
brown
about
this
beer
is
part
of
the
name
the
highly
enjoyable
honey
flavour
and
ease
of
drinkability
are
the
real
highlights
of
this
brew
an
excellent
session
beer
and
perahps
a
nice
babystep
beer
for
drinkers
who
cant
let
go
of
their
mainstream
lagerspils
those
looking
for
the
typical
brown
ale
will
likely
be
dissappointed
i
dont
think
its
intended
to
be
interpreted
as
such
however
as
an
honey
brown
lager
it
does
well
in
a
pinch
and
is
a
decent
beer
a
good
introductory
craft
brew
extremely
mild
makes
newcastle
look
robust
if
you
like
a
really
mild
brown
you
will
like
this
if
you
want
something
with
a
little
backbone
look
elsewhere
a
great
irish
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
and
never
chugges
for
a
reasonably
cheap
beer
that
can
be
found
most
anywhere
this
ranks
high
on
my
list
nice
malty
amber
that
was
tasting
so
nice
on
st
paddys
day
irish
beer
is
the
best
beer
looks
okay
tastes
generic
watery
red
ale
have
had
far
better
would
not
buy
again
i
usually
drink
these
straight
from
the
bottle
but
what
the
hell
pours
in
to
a
craft
beer
exchange
pint
glass
with
a
nice
amber
color
and
a
high
degree
of
transparency
2
fingers
of
light
beige
foam
disappear
quickly
leaving
only
a
thin
film
and
a
small
collar
the
aroma
is
pretty
clean
just
some
sweet
malty
aromas
perhaps
a
little
hint
of
ripened
fruits
not
much
there
but
pleasant
the
flavor
of
killians
is
unmistakable
of
course
there
are
the
typical
sweet
caramellike
malt
flavors
that
are
common
for
the
style
but
theres
also
something
more
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
id
say
its
reminiscent
of
a
vanilla
extract
flavor
its
a
bit
earthy
and
reminds
me
of
jordanian
almonds
with
that
hard
vanilla
candy
shell
ive
picked
this
up
in
vanilla
beers
such
as
snowdrift
and
breckenridge
so
its
odd
to
find
it
here
but
it
seems
to
work
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
easy
quite
unintimidating
its
simple
and
accessible
despite
some
of
the
flavors
being
a
bit
disjointed
and
a
notion
that
the
product
may
be
on
the
cheap
side
it
comes
together
pretty
well
in
the
end
this
is
a
classic
that
helped
launch
my
love
of
craft
beer
it
was
one
of
the
first
brews
that
i
sampled
that
dared
to
stray
from
the
fizzy
yellow
water
recipe
and
i
for
that
i
am
probably
a
bit
a
partial
really
not
so
bad
my
dad
had
a
penchant
for
this
stuff
and
i
had
some
as
a
youngster
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
remember
savoring
a
beer
for
what
its
worth
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
good
as
other
irish
reds
much
better
on
tap
than
in
bottle
not
that
interested
in
this
style
definitely
underrated
beer
very
good
robust
flavor
with
little
bitterness
commercialized
red
but
tasty
used
to
have
a
good
price
tag
on
it
but
the
price
has
continued
to
rise
on
it
as
if
coors
was
trying
to
get
more
drinkers
by
making
it
seem
more
like
a
craft
beer
o
solid
beer
would
definitely
have
it
again
this
is
actually
a
good
red
ale
its
usually
pretty
cheap
at
the
bar
too
o
not
bad
at
all
this
red
almost
has
a
toastedmalt
taste
like
a
good
california
common
but
theres
definitely
no
hop
presence
not
even
a
bit
of
dirt
too
big
a
swallow
has
a
vodkarubbing
alcohol
taste
but
otherwise
its
a
decent
little
malty
lager
with
some
nice
toasted
notes
and
nothing
to
keep
you
from
downing
a
few
for
a
good
session
very
decent
brew
and
a
pleasant
surprise
o
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
but
not
the
best
ever
will
buy
again
o
not
terrible
better
than
your
average
bcm
lager
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
6
pack
to
take
to
a
party
with
a
lot
of
non
craft
drinkers
out
of
all
the
commoners
this
is
a
personal
favorite
alright
tasting
beer
cheap
taste
excellent
red
lager
with
character
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
money
not
one
that
id
scoff
at
as
a
craft
drinker
and
one
that
a
bmc
drinker
could
also
enjoy
would
buy
again
i
like
this
beer
more
then
most
of
the
reviewers
i
have
read
i
have
no
problem
recommending
this
beer
overall
a
decent
and
drinkable
brew
delicious
and
underappreciated
biscuity
breadiness
and
easy
to
drink
slightly
one
dimensional
but
im
never
disappointed
with
this

good

most
people
dont

it
buts
a

beer
as
the
name
suggests
this
has
a
reddish
tint
in
its
color
its
a
great
lager
and
it
has
a
wide
appeal
sophisticated
beer
snobs
wont
look
down
their
noses
at
it
and
less
experienced
beer
drinkers
will
love
it
its
perfect
for
a
birthday
party
times
have
changed
and
our
favorite
beers
of
yesteryear
just
cant
compete
with
todays
full
flavored
beers
but
this
is
still
great
stuff
an
amber
colored
lager
that
has
a
pretty
good
looking
color
to
it
and
a
nice
aroma
comes
off
clean
and
crisp
after
a
sip
which
is
to
be
exoected
for
a
light
bodied
beer
if
you
like
sweet
this
is
the
beer
for
you
im
not
a
fan
but
it
is
drinkable
i
bought
this
beer
today
and
really
enjoy
the
flavor
one
of
the
best
red
ales
good
stuff
if
your
into
that
this
is
my
goto

just

i
would
give
it
a
c

fairly
decent

at

more

than
youd

its
a

is
easy

mouthfeel
is
thin
and

with

a
lighter

and
a
slightly
bitter
grainy
finish
i
wanted
to
like
it
more
for
the
sake
of
nostalgia
but
this
falls
just
short
of
average
after
the
pour
tonight
it
was
all
down
hill
id
grab
an
amstel
or
miller
over
this
if
a
place
only
served
macro
beer
drinkable
but
barely
this
is
my
fathers
drink
of
choice
and
i
can
see
why
very
tasty
beer
decent
but
nothing
that
stands
out
color
is
ok
and
head
is
decent
but
leaves
very
quickly
not
much
of
a
nose
maybe
a
touch
of
malt
flavor
is
ok
very
light
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
and
an
ever
so
light
hint
of
hops
ood
beer
if
there
is
not
many
other
options
and
this
one
should
be
drank
very
cold
i
just
reviewed

and
i
suggest
you
give
that
a
try
if
its
available
in
your

it
had
more
of
a
savory
theme
going
on
to
me
this
is
just
a

i
would

again
o
damn
good
beer
ill
buy
it
whenever
its
on
sale
or
not
i
have
consumed
copious
amounts
of
various
foreign
and
domestic
brewery
products
in
my
lifetime
especially
during
my
career
in
the
us
air
force
from
19681972
the
canadian
forces
reserve
19801984
and
the

army
from

i
have
spent
twelve
years
in
canada
five
years
in

two
years
in

and
a
year
in
vietnam
in
addition
to
my
years
in
the
continental
us
sampling
beer
i
do
not
usually
drink
more
than
two
bottles
or
cans
at
one
sitting
no
thats
not
because
i
have
to
empty
my
bladder
after
every
two
beers
and
change
seats
at
the
bar
upon
returning
i
have
not
been
thoroughly
intoxicated
since
i
had
an
od
on
rum
and
cola
in
1969
i
view
drinking
alcoholic
beverages
as
relaxing
pleasant
and
even
enjoyable
george
killians
irish
red
is
my
first
choice
and
if
an
establishment
does
not
stock
it
i
frequently
order
tonic
water
or
i
go
elsewhere
o
overall
its
an
alright
beer
its
run
of
the
mill
but
hey
thats
a
lot
better
than
what
the
vast
majority
consumes
its
great
for
barbecues
and
its
not
all
that
expensive
onothing
really
noteworthy
or
special
decent
brew
with
a
little
bit
of
character
overall
classic
metallic
cheapness
on
the
overall
taste
but
this
beer
doesnt
offend
after
that
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
ruby
cast
low
average
head
with
moderate
retention
and
lacing

which
is

for

would
be
my
guesss
overall
i
enjoyed
it
but
nothing
special
overall
nothing
special
about
this
brew
the
light
body
lends
it
to
warm
weather
drinking
it
has
a
decent
light
toasted
flavor
the
slightly
harsh
body
and
finish
prevents
its
from
becoming
a
better
beer
at
9

pack
its
a
plausible
departure
from
the
normal
adjunct
lager
but
its
appeal
wears
off
quickly
and
remains
an
unfortunate
staple
in
my
fridge
theres
better
beers
out
there
for
the
price
and
for
the
category
it
is
now
second
nature
to
me
when
i
see
killians
irish
red
in
a
store
i
immediately
purchase
it
a
straight
forward
easy
drinking
toasted
lager
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
spices
it
pours
red
like
its
name
but
does
lack
in
head
regardless
this
is
my
goto
relaxing
brew
for
any
night
of
the
week
i
dont
think
this
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
my
first
choice
for
sure
o
overall
a
simple
but
pleasant
beer
it
doesnt
blow
you
away
with
any
outstanding
qualities
but
it
doesnt
offend
either
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
had
this
years
ago
sampled
81213
with
a
date
of
may
2013
which
i
dont
know
if
it
was
the
born
or
use
date
as
it
didnt
taste
sour
or
bitter
pours
a
pretty
copperbronze
color
with
a
very
tiny
head
with
just
a
little
lacing
when
sipped
the
aroma
was
of
nothing
special
just
a
light
sweet
malt
smell
the
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
though
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
not
a
real
harsh
aftertaste
either

it
was

toasted

of

and
i
by
romantically
recalling
this
beer
set
next
to
mine
a
honey
brown
on
a
college
bar
basement
table
out
of
context
killians
looks
nice
in
that
oddlynecked
bottle
but
now
under
coors
auspices
one
can
see
what
is
and
is
not
present
in
this
beer
but
it
is
time
to
bring
back
the
previous
taste
please
i
will
just
say
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
taste
it
to
me
taste
like
a
high
alcohol
beverage
with
little
to
no
body
i
couldnt
compare
it
to
anything
i
had
tried
but
maybe
a
domestic
pale
lager
thats
just
my
2
cents
this
doesnt
pretend
to
be
anything
less
than
a
nofrills
easydrinking
lager
the
brand
has
been
somewhat
reincarnated
by
recipe
and
packaging
the
labeling
is
a
bit
more
focused
and
the
beer
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
life
to
it
compared
to
its
former
self
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
something
that
ill
pick
up
when
it
goes
on
sale
every
month
a
decent
red
ale
not
quite
as
good
as
red
oak
but
better
than
any
of
coors
other
offerings
pours
with
very
little
head
decent
golden
brown
appearance
a
bit
harsh
but
none
of
the
metallic
taste
that
some
reviewers
complain
about
o
for
a
widespread
domestic
brew
killians
irish
red
has
a
lot
of
flavor
easy
to
find
both
on
tap
and
in
bottles
its
hard
to
beat
the
taste
for
the
price
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
smooth
red
ale
overall
decent
enough
when
i
feel
like
throwing
the
macros
a
bone
i
could
see
myself
picking
this
up
again
coors
generally
makes
me
want
to
come
back
every
once
in
a
great
while
and
this
is
another
on
the
list
where
ill
go
sure
why
not
end
of
rant
the
beers
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
tinge
of
red
nothing
overly
impressive
to
the
eyes
but
the
head
it
pours
is
amazing
thick
and
with
a
touch
of
red
as
well
it
has
good
staying
power
and
the
best
lacing
ive
seen
in
awhile
the
smell
is
nothing
to
terribly
to
right
about
i
smell
some
floral
mixture
of
some
sort
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
mouthfeel
but
a
bit
watery
for
such
as
strong
tasting
beer
i
did
notice
hints
of
cinnamon
and
orange
strangely
enough
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
around
especially
if
youve
got
folks
over
who
are
a
bit
nervous
to
try
unknown
craft
brews
o
i
havent
had
a
killians
in
like
15
years
and
clearly
i
havent
been
missing
much
i
cant
say
i
will
be
revisiting
this
anytime
soon
o
of
all
the
offerings
i
have
tried
from
coors
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
tried
there
is
also
a
certain
nostalgia
factor
for
this
beer
as
i
drank
quite
a
bit
of
this
when
in
college
in
the
early
90s
and
this
was
better
than
the
average
bmc
available
man
craft
beer
has
come
a
long
way
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
not
one
i
would
go
searching
out
in
the
future
this
is
another
one
of
those
beers
that
used
to
be
pretty
great
and
has
changed
in
the
corporate
setting
still
though
its
the
best
thing
coming
out
of
coors
and
still
has
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
harkening
back
to
my
youth
pours
a
nice
burnt
brick
red
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
it
used
to
smell
a
little
smoky
amongst
the
dry
red
malts
but
now
it
smells
more
like
an
adjunct
heavy
brew
and
they
smoke
is
almost
gone
its
go
an
oatmeal
sort
of
heavy
complexion
to
it
and
the
sweetness
is
sort
of
familiar
too
the
finish
is
long
and
caramel
centered
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
was
changed
the
original
brew
was
really
pretty
good
but
its
become
another
factory
beer
casualty
better
body
than
most
though
and
the
carbonation
is
agreeable
i
can
still
drink
a
6er
of
these
and
enjoy
them
all
but
its
not
what
it
used
to
be
overall
drinkable
but
not
necessarily
enjoyable
nothing
id
care
to
drink
again
unless
my
options
were
severely
limited
so
damn
good
tasting
this
is
a
dinner
beer
steak
or
wings
go
well
with
this
darker
beer
lots
of
carmelly
roasted
smell
roasted
something
when
tasting
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
damn
its
good
this
was
my
first
venture
into
beer
that
wasnt
piss
yellow
very
good
overall
would
recommend
starting
here
before
you
venture
into
craft
beer
a
friend
did
so
for
me
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
transition
into
some
new
stuff
from
your
boring
bud
light
overall
tasted
with
a
sampler
among
other
higher
quality
stronger
beers
tasted
weak
in
comparison
its
very
average
i
didnt
write
a
lot
about
taste
because
there
was
much
overall
while
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
some
transitions
that
are
a
bit
abrupt
overall
there
was
nothing
off
putting
about
the
brew
and
it
was
quite
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
o
i
drank
this
a
bit
when
i
was
first
getting
into
beer
its
certainly
better
than
the
other
micro
options
out
there
but
its
very
simple
and
decent
at
best
it
is
however
a
good
value
at
less
than
66pack
when
i
was
in
college
killians
was
a
beer
that
made
me
feel
like
i
had
arrived
in
25
years
things
have
changed
gone
is
the
burnt
red
coloring
now
its
an
orangish
red
gone
are
the
burnt
aromas
now
is
the
metallic
sweetness
of
a
cheap
beer
gone
are
the
dry
burnt
feelings
of
a
tasteful
irish
red
i
understand
when
a
beer
is
changed
to
appeal
to
the
masses
certainly
cost
is
a
determinant
but
i
feel
violated
when
a
beer
is
assaulted
this
way
i
was
expecting
something
just
a
notch
above
macro
but
i
honestly
think
i
would
prefer
to
just
go
with
the
fizzy
stuff
if
faced
with
a
choice
between
say
pbr
and
this
this
is
a
macro
with
a
bit
of
sickening
sweetness
added
o
amber
ale
for
the
masses
bland
meek
and
inoffensive
tastes
like
a
red
adjunct
lager
which
is
exactly
what
it
is
i
guess
only
drank
this
because
someone
left
one
in
my
fridge
stay
away
overall
i
dig
this
stuff
if
youre
on
a
budget
its
a
decent
goto
its
also
often
on
tap
for
cheaper
than
some
other
beers
and
makes
a
nice
alternative
to
having
to
drink
lesser
bmc
stuff
if
you
dont
have
much
to
spend
not
what
im
going
for
if
money
is
no
object
unless
its
a
kegger
toasted
malts
caramel
nutty
a
little
hint
of
honey
slight
hop
bitterness
towards
the
finish
light
bodied
crisp
dry
well
carbonated
o
an
acceptable
and
lowprice
choice
for
times
when
the
beer
selection
is
weak
sweet
malty
and
drinkable
killians
irish
red
is
a
cut
above
most
of
coors
brewing
companys
offerings
i
enjoyed
this
beer
though
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
again
unless
it
were
given
to
me
o
for
being
one
of
those
beers
that
you
think
is
a
craftmicrobrew
before
you
know
what
those
actually
are
this
aint
half
bad
and
theres
all
kinds
of
things
id
choose
this
over
it
should
also
be
noted
that
there
is
a
massive
difference
in
overall
goodness
when
you
compare
killians
out
of
a
bottle
vs
out
of
a
tap
tap
wins
almost
every
time
taste
is
light
simple
sweetish
toasty
barley
faintly
caramelly
vague
thin
grassypeppery
hop
bitterness
lurking
under
the
sweetness
overall
it
is
simple
thin
vague
and
rather
bland
but
decent
enough
smells
toasty
and
sweet
and
a
little
malty
pretty
common
amber
smell
taste
is
very
unimposing
and
simple
sweet
and
malty
with
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
the
toasted
malt
is
the
dominant
character
here
this
beer
is
fine
but
it
does
taste
a
little
too
mass
produced
id
drink
it
again
but
never
as
a
first
choice
the
body
was
ok
fairly
typical
for
the
style
but
a
lingering
stickiness
cost
a
half
point
drinkability
was
good
the
beer
went
down
smooth
and
easy
but
with
such
an
overall
blandness
why
bother
worth
having
if
there
are
no
craft
options
available
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
common
or
popular
brew
i
will
drink
it
again
for
sure
o
very
good
beer
especially
for
the
price
i
can
drink
a
bunch
of
these
aftertaste
was
offputting
at
first
but
it
becomes
very
chocolatey
very
nice
drinkable
flavorful
beer
from
the
first
sip
this
beer
knocked
me
off
my
chair
it
is
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
its
perfect
beautiful
and
simply
refreshing
even
in
the
dead
of
summer
for
the
moderate
complexity
of
the
taste
this
is
one
red
haired
irish
girl
we
can
all
get
along
with
this
is
also
excellent
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
at
home
a
solid
4
store
bought
beer
great
with
food
but
not
a
session
beer
past
a
6
pack
this
beer
is
a
bit
thick
and
gassy
at
times
and
itll
fill
you
up
with
no
room
to
catch
a
buzz
because
you
have
to
stop
because
youre
fulla
way
around
this
is
to
glass
it
to
remove
carbonation
flavor
is
excellent
regardless
overall
it
was
better
than
i
expected
it
being
a
coors
product
i
wouldnt
buy
it
but
my
wifes
parents
had
some
in
their
fridge
o
not
bad
for
a
beer
for
what
it
is
from
one
of
the
big
brewers
i
first
had
this
long
before
craft
brews
were
existed
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
mail
with
some
toffee
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
flavor
is
similar
with
quite
a
bit
of
toffee
and
grain
coming
through
as
well
as
a
good
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
awful
but
definitely
nothing
to
seek
out
originally
reviewed
07192011
was
handed
a
george
killians
while
sitting
around
a
fire
at
my
buddy
garys
house
open
it
up
to
a
less
than
appealing
smell
and
it
looked
somewhat
darker
than
the
beer
that
i
typically
drink
i
take
a
large
gulp
of
it
and
i
cant
say
that
i
prefer
it
it
tasted
very
stale
and
it
didnt
appeal
to
me
it
isnt
horrible
by
any
means
just
not
very
good
i
believe
there
were
tons
of
these
leftover
the
day
after
i
dont
really
mind
darker
beer
but
this
is
probably
one
of
the
worst
this
is
more
like
a
case
of
where
is
it
than
what
is
it
nothing
that
really
stands
out
as
being
gross
or
offensive
rather
everything
is
pretty
muzzled
and
flavoraromaless
not
something
id
normally
order
but
when
your
other
choices
are
coors
light
and
summer
shandy
well
desperate
times
call
for
desperate
measures
a
clear
light
brown
or
dark
copper
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
falls
quickly
leaving
just
a
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
faint
caramel
and
light
grain
along
with
a
bit
of
metallic
tinge
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
much
like
the
smell
the
with
just
a
touch
of
the
light
and
toasted
caramel
malt
which
is
balanced
by
a
faint
bit
of
hop
no
real
hop
character
or
flavors
are
there
just
the
bitterness
the
overall
character
is
dry
and
relatively
light
a
bit
slick
and
some
of
that
metallic
slipperiness
is
in
there
as
well
this
is
an
ok
beer
obviously
it
isnt
a
true
irish
red
but
its
clear
that
somebody
at
coors
thought
about
what
an
irish
red
should
be
before
making
the
same
light
lager
with
a
darker
color
probably
good
at
a
picnic
but
definitely
not
a
go
to
beer
an
okay
lager
from
big
brother
brings
those
irish
red
ale
elements
to
the
table

o
its
really
cheap
at
my
local
bar
so
i
get
it
often
but
its
really
nothing
special
o
it
is
what
is
and
that
is
a
step
above
the
bmc
usuals
this
was
a
decent
gateway
beer
for
myself
but
i
have
little
interest
in
revisiting
this
unless
i
get
it
free
still
its
a
solid
lawnmower
beer
pours
a
dark
redamber
color
with
a
one
finger
whitish
head
that
goes
down
rather
quickly
and
forms
a
ring
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
crystal
malt
and
toffee
taste
is
similar
and
a
bit
sweet
in
the
fore
front
and
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
as
it
goes
down
light
bodied
o
my
gateway
beer
surprised
it
worked
to
me
this
isnt
that
great
of
an
irish
red
or
even
really
an
irish
red
per
say
by
style
but
it
is
a
decent
amber
lager
i
would
never
buy
this
but
gladly
choose
it
over
any
macro
when
in
a
pinch
single
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
clear
light
amber
body
aroma
is
a
little
musty
with
mostly
sweet
caramel
malt
and
mild
hops
flavor
is
pretty
sweet
mostly
following
the
caramel
malt
with
a
musty
hop
finish
medium
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
a
drinkable
beer
limited
mostly
by
its
mildly
musty
and
bitter
finish
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
think
the
only
reason
some
of
the
beer
snobs
dont
is
because
it
is
made
by
coors
will
always
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
on
tap
i
used
to
work
for
a
distributor
in
ohio
that
was
the
bigggest
seller
of
killians
in
the
country
the
beer
is
great
but
the
company
sucked
to
work
for
always
suprised
me
that
it
doesnt
sell
more
to
the
mainstream
but
i
guess
thats
a
good
thing
o
i
give
this
beer
a
2
5
its
just
too
sweet
would
not
recommend
o
a
lot
of
people
remember
killians
as
an
iconic
beer
the
gateway
beer
that
got
them
into
craft
beer
something
offering
more
than
the
yellow
fizzy
stuff
a
recent
reformulation
brings
this
beer
back
to
me
an
easy
drinking
pint
killians
isnt
anything
spectacular
to
behold
but
it
sticks
closely
to
the
style
and
will
flow
like
water
on
st
pattys
day
doesnt
offer
the
taste
buds
or
the
senses
in
general
much
to
play
with
redamber
beer
with
small
quickly
diminishing
head
fruity
floral
aroma
but
a
strong
malty
taste
thats
slightly
sweet
at
first
smells
and
tastes
a
lot
like
a
wine
cooler
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
for
a
cheap
beer
and
probably
worth
a
try
amber
and
clear
with
a
light
white
head
that
leaves
light
lacing
some
citrus
and
pepper
on
the
nose
tons
of
corn
in
the
nose
too
which
also
dominates
the
body
meh
corn
is
not
my
thing
nor
is
this
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
nice
redish
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smelled
of
caramelized
malt
but
it
was
pretty
weak
tastes
of
caramelized
malt
and
light
hops
but
it
is
not
overly
strong
has
a
nice
smooth
taste
not
overly
carbonated
overall
an
ok
beer
at
least
it
is
better
than
green
beer
for
the
beer
drinking
holiday
in
march
o
not
a
terrible
beer
good
for
the
price
not
really
something
i
would
buy
again
though
has
a
reddish
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
sweet
malt
aroma
and
taste
is
very
similar
has
mild
bitter
middle
with
a
clean
clean
sweet
sour
finish
highly
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
my
personal
favorite
before
getting
into
craft
brews
little
over
a
year
ago
killians
irish
red
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
a
killians
i
had
a
glass
recently
on
tap
meeting
with
a
friend
now
that
my
beer
knowledge
and
tastes
have
expanded
i
wondered
how
the
killians
would
fare
the
killians
is
leather
brown
in
color
which
most
people
would
call
red
a
nice
head
forms
on
top
there
is
a
pleasing
malty
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
much
in
the
english
ale
style
lots
of
malt
and
very
mild
in
the
hop
department
my
memories
were
correct
and
i
have
not
been
completely
jaded
by
big
statement
beers
i
have
tasted
lately
the
killians
was
easy
drinking
and
quite
flavorful
one
of
the
better
molson
coors
products
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
something
id
pick
out
on
my
own
i
got
this
for
free
lol
this
isnt
something
id
pick
out
myself
but
a
guest
for
new
years
brought
over
a
twelvepack
so
might
as
well
tick
it
before
the
festivities
begin
it
pours
a
deep
red
with
orange
tinges
head
drops
down
very
fast
aroma
is
just
a
little
bit
offensive
its
got
some
metallic
caramel
malt
thing
going
on
here
the
taste
is
alright
though
it
goes
down
fairly
watery
with
a
bit
of
a
caramel
malt
finish
thats
rather
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
its
not
a
great
brew
but
ive
had
worse
for
sure
ok
not
must
have
o
not
a
bad
beer
one
of
the
better
ambers
and
im
a
guy
who
only
prefers
belgium
whites
very
satisfying
with
a
clean
enough
finish
but
just
enough
flavor
to
make
you
want
to
drink
more
bottom
line
it
was
a
case
20
bottles
of
free
beer
so
i
drank
them
all
and
it
wasnt
terrible
wouldnt
spend
my
own
money
on
it
but
if
it
was
at
a
party
or
my
wifes
buddy
wants
to
get
them
for
me
again
i
wount
turn
it
down
o
overall
a
good
cheap
beer
when
not
much
else
is
readily
available
coors
does
this
brew
much
better
than
their
counterparts
something
that
i
will
drink
from
time
to
time
o
i
used
to
really
like
this
beer
but
am
not
sure
if
they
changed
the
recipe
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
o
this
is
a
good
amber
lager
id
definitely
put
it
with
the
likes
of
yuengling
or
something
in
that
realm
easy
to
drink
would
certainly
be
a
beer
to
put
down
some
burgers
or
hot
dogs
with
at
a
bbq
i
saw
this
beer
in
a
six
pack
at
the
grocery
store
on
sale
for
right
around
six
bucks
the
first
thing
that
went
through
my
mind
was
an
irish
red
in
a
six
pack
for
6
bucks
may
as
well
give
it
a
try
the
beer
really
has
no
smell
to
speak
of
maybe
a
small
hint
of
malt
the
taste
isnt
bad
because
there
really
is
no
taste
its
very
light
and
slightly
fruity
and
crisp
almost
like
a
very
very
light
wee
heavy
feel
in
the
mouth
was
like
water
i
later
found
out
that
the
name
killian
was
purchased
by
coors
back
in
the
1980s
im
not
sure
how
close
this
beer
is
to
the
original
letts
irish
red
its
based
off
of
but
it
really
isnt
a
very
good
beer
not
worthy
of
the
title
irish
red
anyway
o
one
and
done
if
you
bought
6
keep
the
other
5
in
the
fridge
to
lure
your
friends
away
from
your
other
good
beer
overall
i
remember
thinking
this
was
a
high
quality
brew
in
college
how
the
times
have
changed
of
all
the
irish
red
ales
i
have
had
in
my
area
this
is
the
easiest
to
get
i
might
prefer
saranac
or
even
sam
adams
over
killians
but
it
is
still
a
good
drinking
irish
red
it
does
pour
darker
than
other
irish
reds
i
have
had
but
the
taste
is
still
there
and
is
not
overpowering
this
beer
is
one
of
those
average
beers
you
get
at
a
bar
after
you
have
had
10
drinks
it
is
cheap
and
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
not
really
there
at
all
you
get
a
little
bit
decent
flavors
but
it
is
pretty
bland
for
the
most
part
the
smell
is
just
like
a
basic
beer
and
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
just
an
average
beer
i
would
never
seek
this
out
just
to
have
it
but
i
have
had
worse
overall
a
good
changeup
from
a
light
lager
but
not
something
im
going
to
seek
out
again
this
ones
a
little
one
dimensional
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
too
carbonated
its
drinkable
and
sessionable
though
overall
a
fairly
light
beer
not
exactly
something
id
want
to
session
unless
it
came
from
tap
then
maybe
o
one
of
my
favorite
cheap
beers
this
is
what
i
always
depend
on
if
im
low
on
cash
but
still
want
something
ill
really
enjoy
killians
is
a
classic
simple
delicious
amber
the
best
by
datedec
5
2011
was
placed
at
the
base
of
the
neck
of
the
brown
twist
off
top
bottle
i
poured
it
into
a
mug
the
head
was
less
then
a
finger
and
did
not
maintain
itself
there
was
virtually
no
lacing
the
color
was
redish
amber
it
was
translucent
it
smelled
malty
it
tasted
yeasty
malty
and
nutty
i
did
not
detect
much
in
the
way
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
close
to
that
of
carbonated
water
the
whole
roof
of
my
mouth
felt
the
carbonation
there
was
a
mildly
sweet
finish
with
a
metalic
hint
and
a
lingering
mild
bitterness
this
was
the
only
irish
red
ive
had
and
so
cant
compare
with
others
of
the
style
i
wasnt
repelled
by
it
and
for
the
priceunder
6
dollars
for
a
six
its
an
ok
beer
judge
it
on
its
own
it
does
not
really
compare
to
actual
irish
reds
truly
res
with
an
off
white
head
aromas
of
bread
and
earth
with
a
touch
of
yeast
based
fruitiness
some
light
notes
of
buttered
multigrain
toast
taste
is
smooth
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
and
light
nuttiness
finish
is
dry
and
clean
with
mild
bitterness
somewhat
fizzy
feel
detracts
from
a
overall
crispness
just
enough
body
to
keep
it
from
being
watery
not
a
great
beer
but
certainly
not
the
worst
either
a
beer
you
can
have
more
than
one
of
and
not
feel
bad
about
overall
i
feel
like
i
grew
up
on
this
beer
i
drank
this
beer
in
college
when
we
didnt
drink
bud
light
now
as
a
craft
beer
lover
it
still
has
a
nice
taste
that
changes
with
food
pairings
yes
i
understand
they
fall
under
coors
but
it
is
still
a
nice
beer
body
is
light
and
carbinatied
and
clean
and
refreshing
ok
to
drink
with
pizza
and
you
dont
want
to
interfere
with
the
other
flavors
o
good
beer
i
enjoy
a
killians
irish
red
regardless
of
who
owns
it
nice
and
malty
touch
of
bitterness
to
balance
light
hop
flavor
dancing
with
in
lots
of
great
maltiness
very
drinkable
o
overall
an
average
beer
but
way
better
than
something
like
coors
lite
would
have
it
again
at
a
bar
with
macro
beers
the
beer
appeared
a
decent
clear
red
copper
color
it
produced
a
large
light
foamy
head
it
almost
appeared
to
me
to
be
over
carbonated
the
head
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
dissipated
into
nothing
the
beer
gave
off
a
light
malt
aroma
and
not
much
else
the
taste
of
the
beer
followed
suit
a
slightly
sweet
roasted
malts
but
it
seemed
watered
down
no
aftertaste
to
mention
but
make
sure
that
you
drink
it
while
it
is
cold
i
let
it
sit
for
a
few
minutes
while
grilling
and
it
got
a
bit
warm
and
i
could
not
finish
it
dumped
it
straight
into
the
yard
the
beer
was
light
bodied
and
seemed
over
carbonated
not
exactly
easy
to
drink
but
easier
than
some
overall
i
remember
it
being
better
in
my
college
days
but
then
again
i
really
didnt
drink
good
beer
than
after
this
one
i
am
going
to
stay
away
from
it
o
backup
beer
at
best
used
for
power
hour
overall
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
the
taste
really
started
to
remind
me
of
buttered
popcorn
that
probably
isnt
a
good
thing
when
drinking
a
beer
it
wasnt
undrinkable
but
this
is
not
something
id
buy
again
mo
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
dry
but
still
easy
to
drink
and
overall
this
is
one
poor
excuse
for
a
beer
i
have
never
tried
the
import
ones
from
france
or
ireland
but
if
this
was
a
good
beer
then
coors
sure
has
ruined
it
d
when
i
turned
21
this
was
micro
in
my
area
so
im
a
fan
from
way
back
now
that
im
into
exploring
the
world
of
beer
this
one
is
not
as
micro
as
i
had
thought
back
in
the
day
but
it
still
kind
of
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
is
is
outstanding
as
i
remembered
it
well
no
but
it
is
not
bad
either
trip
down
memory
lane
overall
not
bad
a
decent
gateway
brew
and
something
good
to
have
once
in
a
while
but
nothing
spectacular
i
still
enjoy
it
so
im
willing
to
still
give
money
to
coors
for
this
brew
its
worth
buying
a
six
pack
to
try
do
it
note
i
realize
coors
owns
the
killians
brand
my
reference
to
coors
above
is
speaking
of
coors
banquet
beer
o
killians
is
simply
an
average
brew
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
would
probably
be
a
good
choice
for
the
craft
noob
didnt
pour
this
one
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
tastes
smooth
malty
and
hoppy
pretty
simple
beer
without
much
flavor
carbonated
watery
mouthfeel
not
a
big
fan
of
lagers
but
this
was
decent
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
but
if
offered
i
would
drink
again
probably
the
first
irish
red
i
ever
had
i
know
its
not
a
true
irish
brew
since
coors
makes
it
however
when
i
was
just
starting
out
i
was
just
taking
what
ever
i
could
get
killians
pours
out
as
an
attractive
amber
color
with
a
big
rising
tan
colored
head
on
it
the
head
settles
into
some
random
sudsy
patterns
on
top
of
the
brew
for
a
little
while
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
earthy
with
a
lots
of
caramel
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
been
is
mostly
caramel
too
in
my
opinion
not
much
in
way
of
hops
but
i
still
find
it
to
be
a
tasty
brew
the
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
its
got
a
decent
bubbly
feel
and
its
a
little
thick
too
overall
i
had
so
much
killians
when
i
started
drinking
beers
that
i
thought
id
had
enough
of
it
i
found
myself
with
a
6
pack
given
to
me
on
my
birthday
so
here
i
go
again
with
the
old
school
stuff
again
d
im
done
with
this
brew
it
tastes
like
coors
light
i
have
one
more
in
my
fridge
that
i
will
probably
give
away
or
use
for
a
marinade
that
is
the
only
thing
that
beers
like
this
are
good
for
overall
not
a
drainpour
but
completely
unremarkable
an
average
beer
at
best
boring
and
not
even
a
very
good
accompaniment
to
fish
and
chips
golden
co
does
old
eire
no
favors
here
overallbetter
then
most
bmcs
only
compliment
i
have
o
could
and
have
had
many
of
these
in
a
night
not
exciting
in
any
way
but
also
not
bad
for
booze
on
the
cheap
typical
bmc
hogwash
disguising
itself
as
craft
not
horrendously
bad
but
id
never
buy
it
opretty
plain
if
compared
to
a
red
but
easy
to
drink
and
good
flavor
compared
to
most
lagers
not
a
bad
beer
overall
disappointing
but
its
widely
available
and
not
that
bad
grab
something
better
if
you
see
it
but
this
is
an
alright
goto
red
i
didnt
know
it
was
coors
but
ill
most
likely
try
to
avoid
in
the
future
if
possible
o
not
impressed
but
considering
it
is
a
macro
lager
it
could
be
worse
o
a
decent
offering
from
coors
considering
their
current
bestsellers
but
still
not
a
goto
for
me
ontap
in
a
bottle
no
thanks
well
its
better
than
coors
light
anyway
poured
a
clear
reddishamber
carbonated
and
a
small
white
head
sweet
malty
aroma
not
much
else
to
speak
of
light
sweet
taste
malts
burnt
sugar
bitter
and
pretty
weak
light
watery
body
stale
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
drinkable
if
you
want
drink
whole
cases
at
a
time
and
get
wasted
otherwise
avoid
this
one
i
will
say
that
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
its
drinkable
o
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
when
i
crave
a
red
lager
as
its
widely
available
and
not
hard
on
the
wallet
if
you
feel
like
using
them
to
stay
refreshed
on
a
hot
day
not
the
best
there
is
but
definitely
worth
sampling
o
disappointing
i
remember
liking
this
beer
several
years
back
but
every
time
ive
had
it
since
then
its
been
a
real
let
down
pours
to
a
reddish
amber
color
and
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
and
sweet
pale
malt
and
a
wisp
of
hops
slightly
breadybiscuity
in
the
nose
flavor
is
typical
american
amber
lager
upfront
but
resolves
to
a
very
pleasant
lingering
fresh
and
crisp
maltiness
that
stays
around
a
long
time
this
beer
is
better
than
i
remember
it
being
way
back
about
8
years
ago
it
has
a
very
maltoriented
profile
the
only
drawback
is
the
thin
harsh
macrolager
mouthfeel
the
hops
only
serve
to
balance
the
sweetness
as
good
as
amber
bock
if
not
a
touch
better
in
the
malt
profile
there
are
better
irish
reds
out
there
back
when
i
thought
whoa
dark
stuff
nope
there
is
no
body
here
aside
from
carbonation
it
could
get
confused
with
h20
i
could
probably
pound
them
like
theres
no
tomorrow
but
i
think
ive
grown
from
that
well
on
the
appearance
it
pours
a
small
half
finger
head
it
looks
very
nice
though
a
little
creamy
perhaps
and
i
can
tell
its
leaving
ok
lacing
considering
its
made
by
coors
the
body
is
a
little
lame
its
slightly
transparent
and
there
is
probably
more
carbonation
than
there
should
be
the
body
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
so
it
looks
like
a
red
should
look
like
the
head
is
now
gone
meh
it
looks
ok
the
lacing
is
its
only
redeeming
factor
and
well
see
if
that
lasts
the
whole
way
down
well
the
smell
is
a
little
interesting
the
main
smell
is
malt
and
the
average
irish
red
smell
which
is
good
its
good
that
it
actually
has
an
irish
red
smell
too
it
the
only
thing
weird
is
there
is
a
distant
smell
i
cant
make
out
what
it
is
its
not
a
coors
smell
its
just
different
who
knows
maybe
it
wont
be
a
bad
flavor
overall
the
aroma
actually
isnt
that
bad
pretty
standard
wow
well
this
one
is
hard
to
grade
on
taste
at
first
you
get
that
coorsy
taste
so
i
guess
i
was
wrong
it
was
a
coors
smell
just
that
generic
beer
adjunct
taste
then
comes
the
more
genuine
irish
red
taste
malty
and
what
not
then
in
the
finish
you
get
a
huge
sweetness
its
not
a
malt
sweetness
and
its
not
brown
sugar
or
molasses
or
maple
or
anything
like
that
frankly
it
tastes
like
they
just
poured
table
sugar
in
here
i
know
that
sounds
bad
but
it
finishes
things
off
nicely
it
would
be
different
if
it
was
super
overpowering
but
its
not
it
helps
me
forget
about
that
coors
taste
too
overall
i
mean
table
sugar
is
no
great
micro
brew
ingredient
so
i
cant
really
give
it
points
for
that
but
i
will
say
that
the
taste
isnt
bad
overall
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
which
is
what
i
was
expecting
irish
reds
are
supposed
to
be
somewhat
thin
but
this
is
pretty
fing
thin
so
nothing
special
there
the
drinkability
is
pretty
nice
the
sugar
tatse
probably
helps
with
that
a
lot
and
the
fact
that
its
light
overall
not
a
bad
beer
one
of
the
better
coors
brews
out
there
there
is
still
that
coors
taste
but
oh
well
d
theres
not
a
lot
to
dislike
here
but
theres
also
not
a
lot
to
like
ultimately
i
wantneed
more
of
something
in
order
to
keep
coming
back
for
pint
after
pint
something
that
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
2
5
o
its
slightly
better
than
most
macro
lagers
but
its
just
not
that
great
o
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
buy
or
seek
out
better
than
the
average
offering
from
one
of
the
big
three
but
certainly
a
far
cry
from
true
craft
beer
its
not
bad
if
you
want
to
pound
down
beers
in
quantity
but
as
for
taste
there
is
nothing
special
from
the
venue
you
could
probably
guest
as
to
the
freshness
of
the
beer
given
that
most
of
the
folks
were
drinking
this
and
not
bud
light
i
was
holding
out
hope
red
in
color
clear
the
head
was
there
and
gone
in
a
flash
and
could
not
be
resurrected
the
aroma
was
caramel
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
what
seemed
to
be
strawberry
ice
cream
there
was
a
slight
mineral
smell
but
i
think
that
might
have
been
the
glassware
some
carbonation
in
the
beginning
plain
middle
malty
a
tad
of
hops
leans
toward
the
dry
side
everything
disappears
in
the
end
with
an
odd
just
perceptible
metallic
taste
d
im
still
a
fan
of
killians
irish
red
despite
an
average
score
here
i
enjoy
drinking
one
or
two
every
now
and
then
deasy
to
drinknot
enough
flavor
though
would
drink
one
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
bu
prob
wouldnt
order
again
dark
red
bronze
with
good
froth
up
front
but
qui
kly
fades
away
only
smells
like
the
mettalic
keg
its
stored
in
tasts
is
not
really
there
was
expecting
something
heavier
good
carbonation
what
you
would
expect
from
a
commercialized
american
beer
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
drinkability
very
drinkable
due
to
nice
flavor
and
refreshing
crisp
end
its
a
good
food
beer
could
drink
this
with
all
but
the
lightest
meals
i
will
keep
with
around
more
often
could
use
more
dextrin
for
body
reduce
the
ester
character
and
build
the
malt
definetely
would
drink
again
whenever
im
in
the
mood
for
an
amber
lager
that
is
cheap
and
easy
to
find
d
great
its
not
too
dark
where
if
you
drink
too
you
feel
sick
a
six
pack
will
make
you
have
a
great
buzz
but
you
wont
be
sloppy
drunk
i
love
this
beer
and
drink
it
all
the
time
especially
if
its
on
draft
while
this
isnt
a
horrible
beer
its
not
great
i
know
this
tastes
better
from
the
tap
so
if
it
was
one
of
the
only
choices
id
take
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
red
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
light
malt
barley
and
grain
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
same
with
the
taste
very
watered
down
and
just
slight
malt
and
grain
flavors
tastes
like
a
sweeter
version
of
coors
light
a
lot
better
tasting
than
coors
light
though
which
isnt
hard
to
do
the
mouthfeel
is
watered
down
and
drinkability
is
high
if
youre
at
a
tailgate
or
something
but
not
something
i
would
have
before
bed
or
with
dinner
this
is
no
alaskan
amber
but
it
is
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
wanting
to
move
away
from
bud
light
and
coors
light
i
would
drink
this
again
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
order
if
your
somewhere
that
doesnt
have
a
good
selection
pours
clear
orange
with
streaks
of
red
throughout
head
is
small
and
gone
within
seconds
aroma
of
sweet
malt
not
too
much
flavor
except
for
a
little
sweetness
little
to
no
hops
detected
at
all
finish
is
watery
with
no
bitterness
and
only
very
very
slight
dryness
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
faint
caramel
malts
taste
is
the
same
caramel
malts
with
some
toasted
malts
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
perfect
for
barbeques
and
all
other
sort
of
summer
outings
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
red
color
almost
orange
like
it
has
a
smallish
head
something
predictable
from
coors
brewing
has
the
typical
coors
scent
to
it
but
a
little
more
deeper
it
has
a
darker
taste
then
most
coors
products
it
has
about
the
same
after
taste
of
coors
banquet
it
goes
down
smooth
a
beer
i
grew
up
with
i
love
it
it
is
my
safety
beer
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
especially
around
st
pattys
day
easy
medium
body
high
carbonation
sticky
and
dry
but
not
in
a
pleasant
fashion
another
expendable
forgettable
beer
although
better
than
typical
light
macro
brews
reddish
color
as
the
name
suggests
not
overly
flavorful
but
kind
of
bold
maybe
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
taste
but
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
satisfying
brew
has
a
little
different
finish
than
most
beers
ive
drank
its
pretty
good
i
think
i
paid
6
77
for
6
at
walmart
cap
is
real
not
twist
off
thank
god
it
was
free
for
winning
a
round
of
trivia
would
never
recommend
this
to
anyone
drink
ability
is
good
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
nice
taste
almost
a
session
beer
drinkability
my
friend
and
i
debated
ordering
another
pitcher
haha
very
drinkable
for
times
when
youre
just
chilling
with
friends
and
need
an
easygoing
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
crap
would
definitely
go
after
it
again
if
i
was
in
a
pinch
and
didnt
want
craft
beer
ok
i
have
debated
whether
or
not
to
even
review
beer
like
this
because
i
am
not
interested
in
taking
a
snobby
snide
approach
to
a
beer
that
doesnt
claim
to
be
a
craft
brew
i
crack
a
natty
ice
from
time
to
time
and
i
would
be
lying
to
say
that
i
didnt
enjoy
it
all
beer
has
its
place
although
killians
is
better
served
with
a
drop
shot
of
baileys
and
jamison
it
can
be
enjoyed
for
what
it
is
affordable
beer
easydrinking
brew
lighter
flavors
might
even
enhance
how
drinkable
it
is
but
theres
not
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
about
it
still
ill
take
this
over
your
typical
bmc
megamacro
rice
and
cornadjunct
beer
anytime
d
very
refreshing
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
to
match
again
not
craft
but
still
drinkable
i
actually
didnt
know
this
was
a
coors
product
though
it
doesnt
surprise
me
because
the
selection
at
the
bar
on
long
island
was
pretty
bad
we
had
20
minutes
until
a
train
came
into
the
city
so
time
for
a
beer
at
the
bar
next
door
pours
a
copperamber
colour
without
any
head
whatsoever
no
lacing
either
fairly
sweet
smell
of
toasted
caramel
just
sweetness
in
the
flavour
no
bitterness
thin
mouthfeel
i
guess
this
beer
is
fine
to
drink
and
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
for
free
but
i
dont
plan
to
pay
for
one
again
brought
in
a
clean
room
temperature
glass
i
requested
no
chilled
glassware
about
1
finger
head
of
very
light
brown
color
of
the
brew
was
a
medium
brownish
red
smell
of
wheat
rye
and
malt
just
a
note
i
find
it
harder
to
make
out
smells
while
food
is
going
by
well
balanced
flavor
of
roasted
wheat
rye
hops
and
malt
tangy
after
taste
a
little
weak
in
the
mouth
feeling
but
much
better
than
light
beers
better
than
most
of
the
selection
on
tap
will
order
again
while
there
goes
down
easy
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
nothing
to
turn
your
nose
up
at
the
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
even
though
it
has
a
little
carbonation
to
it
the
color
is
beautiful
but
the
taste
and
smell
i
would
say
are
just
average
overall
served
from
tap
into
a
mcgees
irish
pub
restaurant
mug
poured
redorange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
and
nutmeg
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
wasnt
really
a
great
beer
i
have
never
really
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
now
i
remember
why
in
my
opinion
there
are
just
too
many
off
flavors
for
this
style
and
is
not
appealing
to
my
palate
nutmeg
is
also
not
one
of
my
favorite
flavors
in
a
beer
either
the
aroma
was
okay
though
for
the
most
part
but
that
is
about
it
12
oz
bottle
pours
copper
color
with
long
lasting
offwhite
head
soda
like
carbonation
very
light
aroma
of
floral
hops
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
light
body
flavor
is
also
light
floral
hops
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
too
much
for
the
style
finish
practically
non
existent
i
still
remember
i
used
to
like
this
beer
when
i
was
coors
extra
gold
fan
apparently
there
are
still
quizzo
beers
i
havent
yet
reviewed
as
i
tick
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
only
light
mandarin
oranges
and
light
toffee
the
taste
doesnt
deviate
too
far
from
this
adding
only
a
touch
of
orange
peel
and
a
small
dash
of
pepper
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
lil
brew
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
more
than
enough
for
quizzo
killians
irish
red
to
me
is
a
very
under
rated
beer
it
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
as
the
scent
of
carmal
malts
tickle
your
nose
and
also
your
tounge
upon
tasting
it
has
a
very
mellow
taste
which
makes
for
some
easy
drinking
hardly
a
craft
beer
but
still
a
nice
drink
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
first
nonstandard
beers
i
ever
tried
not
as
good
as
i
remember
may
be
a
nice
entry
level
irish
red
i
would
choose
this
over
any
macro
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
value
priced
nice
alternative
to
other
mainstream
beers
for
a
party
or
gathering
good
drinkability
a
friend
brought
this
over
so
i
decided
to
give
it
whirl
the
bottle
filled
the
glass
with
redorange
colored
brew
with
some
semblance
of
a
head
sweet
adjunct
and
artificial
caramel
dominate
the
nose
thin
on
the
palate
the
flavors
range
from
caramel
malt
to
corn
sweetness
with
not
much
bitterness
at
the
end
not
impressed
dnot
hard
to
drink
by
any
means
pretty
mediocre
which
isnt
always
a
bad
thing
overall
this
is
a
below
average
beer
but
above
average
for
coors
personally
though
i
dont
care
for
the
overly
fruity
cranberry
flavor
d
drinkability
is
average
quite
watery
and
mellow
if
you
have
no
micro
beers
available
this
might
be
a
good
goto
beer
overall
heres
what
to
do
pour
a
bottle
of
coors
drop
a
few
drops
of
red
food
dye
in
it
and
call
it
killians
seriously
i
cannot
taste
any
difference
in
this
from
a
regular
macro
lager
pass
on
this
one
pours
a
slightlydarkened
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
and
a
touch
of
lacing
nose
is
light
amber
malt
with
a
but
of
a
nutty
character
and
some
mild
earth
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
and
earthy
with
a
touch
of
caramel
added
medium
feel
with
good
carbonation
and
is
slightly
drink
drinks
well
enough
but
nothing
special
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
a
choice
i
would
go
to
if
there
was
no
craft
on
tap
the
abv
makes
it
a
easy
pitcher
or
two
good
job
on
making
a
pretty
good
beer
coors
atmosphere
is
pretty
decent
nothing
really
to
speak
of
appearancewise
nose
is
a
solid
robust
grain
with
a
woody
tone
flavor
is
full
and
robust
but
body
is
a
little
washed
out
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
quaff
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
and
some
lacing
smells
of
vanilla
and
some
barley
tastes
much
the
same
a
little
malty
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
character
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
the
drinkability
is
more
or
less
average
the
verdict
on
this
beer
is
that
itd
make
a
good
fall
back
or
session
beer
if
you
go
in
not
expecting
to
have
your
face
blown
off
you
may
be
surprised
ah
killians
first
off
i
will
say
that
i
enjoy
killians
and
it
is
a
good
brew
for
the
price
the
beer
is
a
light
red
color
that
leaves
a
finger
and
a
half
head
that
goes
away
gradually
with
some
lacing
not
too
much
to
say
in
the
smell
department
a
slight
sweet
aroma
is
all
taste
wise
killians
is
somewhat
sweet
with
malts
evident
some
corn
and
a
touch
of
honey
to
finish
pretty
good
overall
highly
drinkable
and
goes
down
smooth
all
in
all
killians
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
regular
rotation
in
my
fridge
from
bottle
into
a
frosted
pilsner
pour
is
a
dark
amber
and
the
head
is
of
thin
offwhite
foam
not
much
comes
to
my
attention
when
trying
to
collect
something
from
the
aroma
all
i
really
get
is
that
faint
beer
smell
that
a
lot
of
mass
produced
beers
have
nothing
too
special
in
this
category
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
was
quite
nice
it
is
one
of
the
smoothest
irish
reds
but
that
isnt
necessarily
a
compliment
smoothness
is
often
indicative
of
a
low
quality
and
simple
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
if
killians
is
available
its
probably
going
to
be
one
of
the
better
choices
all
in
all
a
fantastic
mass
produced
beer
this
is
another
offering
from
a
large
commerical
brewery
under
the
guise
of
a
microbrewish
label
coors
does
this
we
the
blue
moon
line
as
well
but
killians
is
not
in
that
league
i
will
say
that
they
are
very
drinkable
though
and
they
practically
drink
themselves
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
can
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
would
buy
it
over
and
over
overall
if
i
want
to
drink
a
lighter
beer
this
is
my
choice
pretty
good
taste
smell
is
mostly
sweet
malts
graininess
i
did
notice
a
bit
of
adjunct
taste
to
it
but
overall
its
decent
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
caramel
side
needs
a
bit
more
hops
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
tame
almost
bland
beer
but
its
at
least
better
than
other
offerings
from
coors
pretty
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
its
mediumbodied
but
not
too
heavy
compared
to
a
lager
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
i
had
to
choose
over
something
like
bud
light
or
corona
but
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
just
wasnt
as
good
as
the
sam
adams
version
pours
a
deep
rich
amber
color
with
minimal
head
scent
is
weak
and
brings
a
slightly
musty
and
lightly
sweet
smell
with
some
adjunct
like
qualities
taste
is
more
balanced
lightly
sweet
malts
with
a
bitter
hop
bite
thats
earthy
and
musty
again
some
adjunctness
to
the
taste
such
as
steamed
veggies
medium
bodied
lightly
carbonated
a
good
change
of
pace
from
the
bmc
lites
of
the
world
but
still
some
off
qualities
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
on
tap
is
definately
more
enjoyable
than
in
the
bottle
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
little
bitterness
which
is
pleasant
to
my
pallet
not
the
best
tasting
beer
with
food
though
in
my
opinion
but
if
you
have
a
regular
beer
or
two
of
choice
then
this
does
offer
a
nice
change
up
from
the
norm
though
not
fair
to
compare
it
is
probably
the
best
amber
beer
made
on
american
soil
thats
just
my
opinion
though
the
taste
is
a
bit
bland
has
some
grain
a
light
sweetness
and
some
hop
bitterness
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
but
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
by
any
means
usual
mouthfeel
for
the
style
but
is
pretty
easy
drinking
ive
had
this
on
tap
before
and
its
a
better
way
of
drinking
killians
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
redamber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
on
top
no
lace
left
behind
scents
of
toffee
caramel
honey
this
is
really
on
the
sweetsmelling
side
the
caramel
comes
through
in
the
flavor
fullforce
but
thats
where
it
stops
this
is
pretty
onedimensional
very
sweet
finish
it
had
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
body
was
firm
i
dont
know
its
not
bad
but
it
was
pretty
average
nothing
that
i
would
scream
to
get
more
of
ok
its
better
then
a
coors
and
a
notch
under
blue
moon
drinkability
quite
drinkable
in
fact
im
quite
enjoying
this
beer
to
me
this
beer
is
underrated
perhaps
thats
a
function
of
its
being
a
coors
product
i
dont
know
but
this
beer
beats
my
expectations
in
all
categories
id
gladly
quaff
this
stuff
again
not
generally
sold
at
bevmo
but
did
find
it
a
a
local
shell
station
dont
know
whats
up
with
that
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
deep
amber
color
only
about
an
inch
of
head
strong
scent
of
bready
uncooked
bread
this
is
a
pretty
weak
offering
for
a
red
lager
the
malt
flavor
seems
weak
and
no
real
hop
profile
this
beer
is
available
in
most
resturants
that
have
coors
products
i
used
to
drink
this
beer
more
before
i
learned
that
there
were
better
offerings
in
this
style
its
better
than
the
typical
top
3
domestic
beers
notes
overall
not
a
bad
beer
id
say
if
you
wanted
a
nice
semisweet
lager
this
is
a
good
choice
it
doesnt
have
any
sharp
or
metallic
tastes
that
being
said
it
is
just
a
little
sweetness
in
a
semimedium
bodied
liquid
not
that
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
all
in
all
an
average
beer
mediumbodied
but
missing
a
considerable
depth
of
character
still
one
of
the
better
beers
offered
by
coors
d
superb
nothing
offensive
in
the
taste
nothing
to
think
twice
about
good
abv
for
sessioning
and
just
an
all
around
friendly
beer
d
lawnmowing
would
be
a
plus
for
this
beer
d
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
md
the
beer
has
good
body
and
nice
carbonation
it
goes
down
really
smooth
good
drinkability
d
i
could
see
many
beer
drinkers
pounding
this
due
to
its
straightforward
look
taste
and
feel
not
very
challenging
to
the
status
quo
except
in
the
color
of
the
brew
earlier
precoors
version
was
better
this
is
lackluster
drank
one
and
it
will
probably
be
the
last
ever
i
can
see
why
i
liked
these
years
ago
malt
forward
very
low
bitterness
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
simple
but
still
moderately
endearing
this
is
a
good
standard
beer
that
has
average
taste
and
is
a
good
standby
if
there
are
limited
other
options
i
find
myself
purchasing
this
a
lot
for
its
easy
drinkability
decent
taste
and
relatively
low
price
killians
red
is
also
easy
to
find
at
most
major
chains
that
carry
beer
in
the
u
s
it
has
a
nice
amber
red
color
to
it
little
bit
of
head
and
lace
to
it
a
light
smell
of
malt
it
really
doesnt
have
much
of
a
taste
other
than
a
malt
bitterness
it
goes
down
smooth
my
taste
buds
is
saying
get
something
that
has
a
better
taste
i
would
say
for
a
cheaper
beer
it
is
good
but
im
not
running
out
to
get
more
mouthfeel
is
very
light
smooth
going
down
ultimately
for
as
light
as
the
beer
is
i
dont
find
it
very
drinkable
because
all
it
does
is
make
me
want
to
find
something
with
more
flavor
and
body
to
it
pairing
score
f
holy
good
god
i
feel
gross
from
the
rice
pudding
final
notes
this
was
the
beer
that
started
moving
me
more
toward
better
beer
i
remember
really
liking
it
back
in
the
day
but
now
its
just
okay
a
good
stepping
stone
and
ill
drink
it
if
its
the
best
thing
there
is
drinkability
goes
down
easy
just
like
many
mass
produced
beers
not
a
bad
brew
just
overly
average
drinkability
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
at
least
as
far
as
macros
go
however
you
could
do
better
still
its
drinkable
and
good
enough
to
make
a
session
out
of
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
amberred
and
fairly
translucent
off
white
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smell
and
taste
are
mostly
malty
carmel
the
first
sixer
i
bought
on
my
21st
birthday
is
not
what
i
used
to
think
it
was
mouthfeel
was
subpar
sa
red
is
a
lot
better
all
around
if
you
are
desperate
but
there
are
a
lot
of
superior
micro
varieties
made
by
coors
what
do
you
expect
drinkability
this
is
a
simple
pretty
drinkable
beer
much
better
than
most
other
things
for
the
same
price
but
still
fairly
unexciting
d
if
you
are
seeking
a
sweet
beer
this
is
it
i
did
not
hate
it
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
this
was
my
first
beer
ever
and
i
still
enjoy
it
for
nostalgia
appeal
and
for
comfort
whenever
im
wiped
out
from
stronger
stuff
its
nice
to
go
back
to
this
irish
red
for
a
nice
drink
i
can
enjoy
without
fighting
my
way
past
bitter
hops
rjt
if
this
beers
price
was
onpar
with
its
taste
then
maybe
id
consider
some
drinkability
but
its
not
so
no
not
very
drinkable
drinkibility
low
to
moderate
could
not
see
myself
finishing
more
then
a
couple
of
these
back
to
back
i
would
not
buy
it
except
to
avoid
bud
light
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
for
the
price
i
would
rather
spend
a
couple
bucks
to
drink
this
instead
of
bud
light
or
anything
that
is
equivalent
to
seltzer
water
pours
a
medium
red
color
with
1
finger
of
head
with
pretty
good
retention
but
no
real
lacing
hits
of
toasted
maltbutter
in
the
aroma
but
mostly
has
a
metallicclub
soda
smell
initial
taste
is
kind
of
like
wet
sawdust
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
flavor
before
thinning
out
with
just
the
slightest
amount
of
bitterness
body
is
thin
finish
is
thin
fast
and
clean
meh
d
tried
a
12pack
of
these
for
my
first
irish
red
not
disappointed
will
keep
these
in
the
beer
fridge
from
time
to
time
d
obviously
the
abv
is
very
low
on
this
beer
since
its
coming
from
coors
this
is
easy
to
drink
as
the
taste
isnt
very
strong
i
can
see
how
people
who
only
drink
other
coors
products
this
this
is
a
heavy
beer
i
mean
its
pretty
dark
p
anyway
this
isnt
a
beer
i
will
be
having
again
d
this
is
your
average
ale
not
overly
flavorful
but
still
enjoyable
and
drinkable
none
the
less
overall
not
worth
the
extra
money
considering
the
experience
killians
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
actually
its
quite
good
just
not
memorable
or
anything
better
on
tap
i
would
never
buy
it
for
home
consumption
just
so
many
better
options
out
there
i
will
order
this
at
a
bar
when
your
choices
are
lame
bud
bud
light
or
killians
pours
a
dark
red
i
wouldnt
say
that
this
beer
is
great
but
its
pretty
good
especially
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
its
made
by
an
american
macro
brewery
its
a
good
price
ive
had
this
for
as
cheap
as
11
00
a
12
pack
in
new
york
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
for
a
good
price
you
are
much
better
off
buying
this
than
budweiser
or
coors
this
is
my
first
review
hope
it
goes
good
first
had
this
back
in
1989
in
denver
couldnt
find
it
back
home
in
illinois
until
9192
my
first
beer
outside
the
normal
massproduced
lite
beers
its
been
my
favorite
since
though
the
smell
doesnt
set
my
nostrils
raging
the
color
is
very
inviting
when
poured
right
a
nice
thick
head
is
produced
with
staying
power
this
is
a
beer
i
always
go
back
for
when
there
isnt
a
micro
that
is
catching
my
eye
i
believe
this
is
a
great
beer
to
introduce
to
the
rookie
that
has
decided
to
venture
forth
and
try
something
that
isnt
found
on
tv
commercials
i
have
introduced
this
to
several
friends
and
now
they
are
fans
of
the
going
outside
the
norm
cheers
pours
a
clear
ruddy
brown
with
about
two
inches
of
head
the
head
dies
down
quickly
leaving
light
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
no
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
not
at
all
bitter
extremely
smooth
and
almost
creamy
to
drink
the
malt
creates
a
biscuit
like
aftertaste
an
easy
drinker
but
a
little
thick
for
long
drinking
this
is
one
of
my
cheap
goto
beers
whenever
i
am
having
a
bunch
of
people
over
and
i
need
some
cheap
beer
that
tastes
decent
this
is
always
a
sure
buy
very
smooth
beer
without
the
cheap
beer
aftertaste
which
sets
it
apart
from
the
budweiser
or
coors
garbage
fizzy
white
head
no
retention
no
lacing
color
is
a
clear
amberred
theres
nothing
strong
on
the
aroma
just
some
sweet
toasted
malts
taste
is
similar
with
some
more
caramel
i
cant
pick
up
any
hops
very
light
body
for
a
lager
high
carbonation
and
sticky
finish
doesnt
make
for
a
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
drinkability
i
could
have
a
few
if
i
want
to
get
buzzed
but
otherwise
just
one
would
be
enough
for
me
d
i
remember
getting
smashed
on
ol
george
several
st
pattys
in
a
row
easy
to
swug
and
easy
to
not
taste
this
is
a
betterthanaverage
macro
for
beer
pong
or
whatever
id
take
this
over
anything
with
light
on
the
can
but
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
d
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
nothing
attractive
about
it
either
i
found
it
to
be
more
filling
than
a
pint
of
water
but
less
refreshing
buy
again
yes
d
decent
drinkability
and
for
the
price
certainly
an
alternative
to
most
macro
lagers
out
there
notes
alright
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
a
step
up
from
the
traditional
light
adjunct
lager
middle
of
the
road
for
a
craftlike
macro
offering
not
bad
just
nothing
special
mouthfeel
lacking
didnt
enjoy
it
from
the
beginning
at
least
it
tames
itself
out
a
little
more
becomes
more
watery
way
too
expensive
for
this
quality
of
beer
they
got
this
and
guiness
on
tap
at
the
tavern
for
st
pattys
season
its
not
made
anywhere
near
ireland
so
go
figure
anyway
i
think
its
better
from
a
keg
than
i
remember
from
the
bottle
pours
a
nice
looking
deep
red
with
a
respectable
head
lacing
holds
up
well
for
the
most
part
clean
sweet
earthy
notes
in
the
smell
balanced
and
easy
drinking
sweet
and
bready
up
front
a
little
bit
of
a
spicy
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
has
faint
metalic
adjunct
like
quality
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
more
substanial
and
less
watery
eh
i
like
it
very
easy
to
put
down
quite
a
few
pints
of
these
id
like
to
try
an
authentic
red
from
ireland
im
betting
it
would
be
way
better
not
a
bad
beer
though
i
like
the
read
appearance
that
this
irish
red
gives
off
the
taste
is
alright
slightly
malty
but
nothing
stands
out
i
can
smell
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
even
though
it
doesnt
have
a
high
abv
i
think
its
an
alright
beer
that
many
of
my
friends
would
consider
a
really
good
craft
brew
i
would
call
it
a
weak
try
by
coors
to
enter
the
irish
red
realm
killians
is
clean
with
a
mellow
sweet
caramel
presence
hops
are
quite
minimal
throughout
giving
a
sweeter
impression
despite
a
drier
finish
all
in
all
its
underwhelming
from
the
aroma
through
the
finish
but
it
also
doesnt
have
any
glaring
flaws
it
just
doesnt
have
much
to
offer
to
those
seeking
out
hand
crafted
flavorful
beers
i
dont
mind
this
beer
for
a
macro
but
its
definitely
a
last
resort
at
a
bar
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
slightly
sweet
to
be
honest
not
much
going
on
with
the
aroma
not
much
going
on
with
the
taste
either
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
no
hop
flavor
detectable
what
gives
thin
and
watery
the
carbonation
is
fair
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
save
your
money
another
very
good
amber
lager
one
of
the
few
beers
i
will
order
on
tap
just
cant
get
past
killians
to
try
anything
else
has
a
very
nice
appearance
and
taste
to
go
along
with
it
for
me
it
goes
well
with
lunch
and
dinner
not
too
heavy
and
certainly
not
too
light
mouthfeel
was
average
but
everything
else
was
good
it
took
me
a
while
to
warm
up
to
killians
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
if
you
can
find
it
ontap
definitely
give
it
a
try
its
good
from
a
bottle
too
it
is
an
easy
irish
red
brew
to
drink
if
you
havent
found
one
you
like
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
has
a
good
deal
of
flavor
the
feel
is
ok
not
very
drinkable
to
me
its
great
goto
beer
when
you
dont
want
to
spend
much
or
dont
want
to
try
something
new
overall
pretty
standard
beer
all
in
all
for
that
price
how
could
i
say
no
the
bar
i
was
at
was
pretty
lively
but
theres
a
nosmoking
rule
in
columbia
so
that
kept
my
senses
in
line
and
yes
i
had
two
before
deciding
i
wanted
something
new
try
it
out
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
nothing
too
terribly
special
either
for
the
price
its
a
win
though
a
better
option
than
bmc
lagers
for
slightly
more
money
d
i
was
rather
suprised
considering
its
brewed
by
coors
not
a
bad
beer
theres
just
so
many
better
beers
out
there
ontap
is
the
way
to
go
with
beer
bottles
take
away
from
the
smelland
the
appearance
a
pint
of
killians
has
a
drink
ability
of
a
light
beer
but
the
respect
of
an
amber
beer
the
smell
of
a
good
amber
draught
makes
may
tong
jump
out
my
mouth
like
a
dog
drinking
water
drinkability
very
good
drinkability
no
harsh
wash
back
nothing
really
special
about
this
beer
but
worth
a
try
i
had
this
ontap
served
in
a
23
ounce
weizen
glass
it
is
a
light
clear
red
with
a
thin
whispy
head
the
nose
is
bready
and
faint
the
flavor
profile
was
hugely
diapointing
a
little
bread
and
a
little
bitterness
the
beer
was
thin
and
watery
and
imo
the
carbonation
was
low
back
in
the
day
killians
was
my
good
beer
but
now
it
seems
like
red
swill
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
slightly
astringent
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
soft
this
beer
is
not
a
great
respresentative
of
this
style
the
flavor
of
the
beer
taste
like
a
coors
with
added
flavors
except
for
what
i
think
is
oxidation
i
think
this
beer
comes
off
very
well
not
a
bad
brew
and
readily
available
in
all
of
my
local
liquor
stores
pretty
drinkable
but
in
the
same
sense
that
water
is
drinkable
not
too
bad
not
too
good
either
i
bought
my
first
six
pack
of
this
stuff
today
not
being
extremely
optimistic
about
it
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
was
the
newly
improved
bottle
label
i
wondering
if
they
put
as
much
effort
as
they
did
into
the
beer
as
they
did
the
label
on
the
bottle
the
first
wiff
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
lighter
and
less
harsh
on
the
senses
than
i
would
have
figured
the
appearance
was
a
nice
amber
color
with
deep
hues
of
red
and
brown
the
taste
was
that
of
a
better
brand
of
beer
since
im
used
to
the
b
m
c
and
at
first
it
was
hard
to
believe
it
was
made
my
coors
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
inviting
which
i
liked
a
lot
the
drinkability
seemed
average
maybe
on
the
heavier
side
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
friend
and
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
just
a
warning
maybe
it
was
just
me
but
this
beer
got
warm
a
little
too
fast
for
me
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
that
i
can
really
savor
as
its
going
down
for
a
coors
product
its
not
that
bad
but
thats
probably
the
nicest
thing
i
can
say
about
it
poured
from
a
brown
12oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
malts
and
grains
taste
is
crisp
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
some
malts
and
a
slight
bitterness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
pretty
easily
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
light
almost
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
retention
or
lace
not
much
of
an
aroma
really
a
little
malt
maybe
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
decent
at
first
but
theres
a
kind
of
sour
metallic
finish
to
it
that
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
more
its
drinkable
i
guess
but
not
something
id
try
again
all
around
not
a
terrible
beer
amber
redish
in
color
with
a
not
all
that
impressive
head
and
lacing
tastes
decent
enough
much
better
than
say
natty
lite
but
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
body
is
light
hints
of
caramel
not
a
bad
brew
if
you
are
at
a
bad
bar
which
you
shouldnt
be
one
follows
another
as
this
brew
easily
flows
from
one
container
to
another
like
a
slinky
this
one
was
great
fun
when
i
was
younger
and
comforting
to
return
to
occasionally
but
certainly
far
from
the
edge
with
so
many
truly
challenging
beers
available
killians
is
reserved
as
a
nostalgic
indulgence
all
in
all
its
nothing
amazing
but
its
not
terrible
either
one
of
my
favorite
macros
a
nice
gateway
beer
between
massdistributed
american
adjunct
lagers
and
more
flavorful
craft
beers
pours
with
a
rosy
amber
color
but
only
a
thin
head
that
dissolves
quickly
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
many
adjunct
lagers
but
the
taste
brings
more
to
the
table
the
flavor
has
a
good
amount
of
malty
sweetness
and
a
crisp
but
almost
buttery
mouthfeel
overall
a
slightly
belowaverage
lager
but
its
a
good
baby
step
up
from
a
majority
of
american
light
lagers
dr
yes
it
tastes
good
it
goes
down
easy
but
is
pretty
unremarkable
for
any
reason
i
had
this
about
a
year
ago
and
remember
it
not
being
so
bad
and
thinking
to
myself
that
i
should
bring
a
notepad
with
me
next
time
i
visit
texas
roadhouse
back
then
it
was
a
pretty
impressive
red
now
not
so
much
most
of
what
i
got
was
that
adjunct
corn
taste
that
bmc
is
known
for
its
an
accessible
unassuming
beer
for
when
there
isnt
anything
better
i
wanted
more
flavor
out
of
this
beer
however
i
had
this
beer
over
a
kristoff
and
it
enhanced
the
cigars
flavor
its
a
beer
i
would
lounge
with
outside
with
a
cigar
if
there
are
no
other
beverages
available
drinkablity
no
just
no
i
can
tell
you
that
much
all
in
all
a
decent
seeion
brew
with
better
flavor
that
most
marco
lagers
decent
reddish
dark
color
with
a
very
watery
base
and
a
rough
thin
strewn
head
a
touch
of
dark
fruits
and
amber
malts
with
a
crisp
toasted
ryeish
body
that
was
wellcarbonated
but
disproportionately
thin
and
watereddown
hop
structure
is
thin
too
and
while
wet
and
drinkable
it
doesnt
face
up
to
the
consistency
that
ive
come
to
delight
in
d
this
was
my
first
beer
and
i
pretty
much
wore
it
out
glad
i
tried
it
again
for
old
times
sake
but
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
any
time
soon
overall
this
beer
has
tons
of
flavor
for
a
macro
lager
and
at
that
macro
price
you
cant
beat
killians
irish
red
just
remember
this
beer
isnt
a
true
irish
red
im
going
to
be
interested
in
trying
actual
irish
reds
in
the
future
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
disapates
quickly
the
smell
is
of
some
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
as
well
the
taste
is
of
some
hops
and
a
little
malt
on
the
back
end
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
not
too
too
bad
the
drinkability
is
not
too
bad
you
could
have
a
couple
of
these
there
is
a
slight
complexity
to
this
beer
it
is
better
than
most
macros
d
id
fall
back
to
this
brew
before
drinking
the
average
crap
they
serve
in
bars
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
its
ridiculously
subtle
just
doesnt
deliver
any
lasting
impression
a
bit
watery
at
times
drinkability
its
so
mild
that
its
much
like
barely
flavored
water
its
actually
decent
though
d
better
than
a
lot
of
macrobrews
the
finish
doesnt
leave
you
dreading
having
to
drink
the
rest
like
some
beers
of
this
caliber
i
find
myself
ready
for
another
sipgulpwhatever
almost
instantly
d
low
i
had
to
stop
at
one
just
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
drinkability
a
nice
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
something
to
drink
with
dinner
i
just
looked
at
the
style
ba
lists
it
as
an
american
amberred
lager
if
thats
the
case
its
pretty
good
to
style
but
the
bottle
itself
is
misleading
nikki
pours
a
bright
redamber
with
a
small
head
that
vanishes
in
seconds
no
lacing
smells
very
faintly
of
grain
it
also
and
im
really
trying
here
smells
slightly
sweet
kind
of
like
caramel
i
guess
theres
also
and
im
hoping
this
was
in
the
glass
i
was
drinking
it
out
of
kind
of
a
soapy
smell
im
gonna
ignore
that
soap
in
my
scoring
i
think
tastes
very
mild
a
little
sweetness
some
very
faint
amber
malt
character
i
guess
some
caramel
its
very
carbonated
body
is
quite
thin
its
easy
to
drink
though
back
in
school
this
was
the
high
end
beer
we
drank
i
still
like
it
though
clearly
there
are
much
better
irish
reds
out
there
in
the
market
nevertheless
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
i
did
not
really
get
a
look
at
the
beer
itself
because
i
just
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
its
got
a
nice
smell
to
it
and
its
got
a
nice
even
taste
its
not
too
strong
not
too
weak
either
it
also
does
not
have
an
aftertaste
nor
is
it
harsh
on
the
mouth
its
an
exceptional
beer
and
it
is
very
refreshing
d
this
is
refreshing
and
easy
going
in
the
same
vein
as
negro
modelo
or
newcastle
and
like
those
beers
its
borderline
watery
and
underflavored
honestly
this
is
a
good
budget
beer
that
is
way
ahead
of
cheap
fizzyyellow
brews
but
is
still
pretty
damn
cheap
i
picked
up
a
sixxer
of
this
for
a
little
over
five
bucks
at
the
gas
station
to
enjoy
with
a
nice
cigar
since
full
bodied
cigars
usually
eat
even
imperial
stouts
alive
i
usually
follow
each
puff
with
a
swig
of
cheapo
beer
or
really
expensive
scotch
go
figure
drinkability
pretty
good
i
could
and
have
had
several
of
these
in
a
row
but
it
is
not
anything
to
get
too
excited
about
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
the
carbonation
works
well
with
the
beer
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
has
been
a
fall
back
when
not
even
sam
adams
is
in
the
house
oddly
enough
it
could
be
nostalgia
but
i
think
i
like
this
more
than
sam
adams
oh
the
horror
d
one
of
those
beers
that
i
used
to
go
to
quite
a
bit
but
now
is
completely
underwhelming
nothing
overly
offensive
but
there
are
other
ambers
that
i
would
reach
for
before
this
again
note
unsure
why
this
is
a
euro
dark
lager
and
not
an
american
amber
red
lager
final
thoughts
i
enjoy
this
beer
not
my
first
pick
but
was
decent
id
choose
a
different
beer
over
this
drinkability
not
a
complicated
beer
and
so
it
would
be
just
fine
for
a
hot
afternoon
of
yard
work
to
kill
the
thirst
and
just
relax
but
there
are
lots
of
fine
pilsners
that
would
serve
the
same
purpose
so
ill
not
be
seeking
out
this
beer
this
beer
is
pretty
light
in
body
with
light
carbonation
goes
down
quite
well
and
is
not
a
bad
beer
for
an
irish
red
a
pretty
good
session
beer
d
a
good
beer
to
get
when
you
dont
have
a
whole
lot
of
money
to
blow
i
can
usually
find
a
pitcher
at
a
local
bar
for
6
but
you
want
something
more
flavorful
than
a
standard
macro
lager
i
vastly
prefer
smithwicks
in
the
irish
red
category
though
final
thoughts
not
a
bad
beverage
from
the
coors
brewing
company
but
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
was
a
bit
weak
on
flavor
well
to
be
honest
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
beer
you
could
call
it
my
gateway
beer
i
us
to
love
it
and
still
enjoy
a
bottle
or
one
on
tap
when
there
isnt
somrthing
better
available
its
a
nice
amber
color
and
has
a
lot
more
flavor
than
its
price
comparable
beers
its
on
the
sweeter
side
witch
i
think
is
what
got
me
hooked
when
i
started
that
or
the
fact
my
cousin
keep
feeding
too
me
the
first
time
i
had
them
til
i
was
plastered
my
opinion
is
for
an
average
everyday
beer
its
better
than
most
but
it
just
doesnt
satisfy
my
palate
these
days
had
this
on
tap
at
paninis
in
columbus
pours
a
nice
copper
redish
color
great
head
retention
sweet
smell
carmelish
slight
hops
presence
tastes
sweet
and
malty
abv
is
moderate
not
one
of
the
best
but
good
for
what
it
is
would
enjoy
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
md
mouthfull
is
very
mild
to
full
bodied
smooth
and
flavorable
make
this
beer
a
good
drinkable
beer
sometimes
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
taste
toasted
taste
with
very
little
hoppy
bitterness
and
almost
a
nutty
taste
the
nutty
taste
actually
remains
as
an
aftertaste
for
only
a
little
overall
i
would
say
theres
nothing
shameful
about
drinking
this
beer
if
its
what
you
have
on
hand
pours
a
very
crayola
red
color
with
minimal
burgundy
head
not
too
much
lace
on
the
glass
tastes
like
a
run
of
the
mill
beer
with
a
slight
bitter
cider
after
taste
not
very
impressed
very
easy
to
drink
would
take
this
to
a
party
to
appear
classy
but
still
be
able
to
drink
a
lot
probably
wont
get
this
one
again
d
a
good
session
beer
appearance
is
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lace
smell
and
taste
is
lightly
malted
that
has
a
saline
sweetness
leaving
an
off
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
seems
thin
and
light
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
its
been
quite
awhile
since
ive
had
killians
and
itll
probably
be
sometime
again
overall
this
was
a
good
return
to
the
past
must
have
been
15
years
since
ive
had
this
and
i
really
didnt
miss
much
a
decent
effort
by
coors
and
by
no
means
a
drainpour
when
traveling
for
business
in
some
parts
of
the
country
i
often
see
this
as
the
dark
beer
choice
decent
pizza
or
burger
beer
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
the
closest
to
craft
macrobrews
can
get
in
my
opinion
it
has
a
rich
but
not
too
strong
flavor
and
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
personally
i
would
drink
this
over
just
about
any
other
macro
on
the
market
and
i
cant
say
anything
negative
about
this
beer
drinkability
i
find
this
beer
would
be
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
dinner
that
is
on
the
bland
side
such
as
a
beef
or
pork
based
dinner
the
caramel
barley
brings
out
a
bitterness
that
wouldnt
go
well
with
a
sweeter
based
dinner
overall
nice
session
beer
that
is
much
better
ontap
than
in
a
bottle
the
flavor
is
all
sweetness
and
toffee
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
theres
no
finish
so
dont
wait
for
it
a
nicely
quaffable
beer
that
is
widely
available
and
decently
flavorful
all
traits
that
make
this
a
popular
brew
and
its
easy
to
see
why
drinkability
is
high
on
this
beer
despite
this
being
a
coors
product
and
most
beer
geeks
turning
it
off
because
of
that
it
is
not
an
entirely
bad
beer
there
is
nothing
crazy
or
better
than
average
about
the
beer
but
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
and
a
fairly
good
beer
for
the
price
it
was
a
copperorange
pour
with
a
lot
of
foamy
creamcolored
head
and
ok
lacing
there
wa
not
a
lot
of
aroma
except
for
a
litle
light
hops
and
perhaps
a
little
citrus
the
mouthfeel
was
waterytomedium
and
nothing
extraordinary
the
taste
was
of
weak
hops
and
a
kinf
of
mix
of
bitter
and
tart
an
adequate
brew
feom
coors
mouthfeel
was
fairly
thin
but
not
horrible
overall
this
is
a
very
average
beer
that
is
just
a
step
ahead
of
the
macros
one
and
done
for
me
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
when
dining
out
especially
with
a
thick
ribeye
steak
on
my
plate
a
tall
glass
provides
the
color
i
compare
all
others
to
and
the
usually
halfinch
head
is
the
light
carmel
color
i
so
adore
the
aftertaste
doesnt
take
away
from
my
meal
yet
is
strong
enough
to
give
my
tastebuds
satisfaction
the
slightly
sweet
flavors
are
a
wonderful
counter
to
the
smokey
steak
it
is
a
bit
thinner
than
the
bottled
versions
however
and
possibly
even
slightly
lower
in
alcohol
content
still
its
my
choice
whenever
its
available
on
tap
got
this
on
tap
the
other
day
at
the
times
bar
and
grill
the
selection
was
limited
and
i
remembered
enjoying
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
before
my
taste
starting
leaning
towards
ipas
and
tripels
i
can
see
why
i
liked
this
beer
more
than
most
of
the
macros
at
the
time
but
i
was
slightly
disappointed
at
this
beer
a
bud
american
ale
is
a
better
choice
if
you
can
make
it
but
killians
irish
red
may
be
the
best
on
tap
when
you
go
out
sometimes
it
poured
decently
enough
an
average
sized
head
with
minimal
lacing
and
a
clear
red
color
the
smell
was
weak
but
nothing
unpleasant
largely
based
off
a
light
caramel
smell
with
alcoholic
aromas
in
the
background
the
taste
isnt
much
more
its
a
very
weak
beer
with
a
sweetness
to
it
it
is
also
overcarbonated
and
quite
watery
its
quite
drinkable
due
to
its
low
alcohol
content
and
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
it
still
lacks
the
quality
factor
many
are
looking
for
id
only
get
this
beer
if
its
the
best
available
on
tap
when
i
go
out
even
still
sometimes
i
might
just
pass
very
drinkable
beer
but
loses
a
distinctive
taste
after
the
first
one
d
decent
at
best
i
think
id
rather
have
a
bud
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
has
a
metallic
feel
to
it
if
that
makes
any
sense
mediumlight
bodied
with
little
carbonation
slightly
syrupy
good
session
beer
i
guess
its
drinkable
definitely
better
on
tap
rather
than
the
bottle
mouthfeel
had
some
zip
with
a
light
to
medium
body
not
as
bad
as
expected
drinkability
very
easy
but
horrible
dirty
aftertaste
beer
than
a
bud
but
not
better
than
much
other
the
color
is
a
coppery
red
it
pours
a
light
head
that
while
it
doesnt
dissipate
too
immediately
does
dissipate
somewhat
quickly
there
is
a
fairly
clean
light
caramel
taste
with
lighter
than
expected
malt
overtones
with
very
very
slight
hops
the
thickness
is
not
as
much
as
expected
about
average
there
is
decent
carbonation
not
a
bad
one
for
a
night
out
this
is
my
go
to
for
the
places
my
friends
like
to
go
that
offer
fewer
micros
d
not
too
poor
of
a
beer
as
a
middle
ground
or
an
introduction
to
craft
beer
its
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
an
american
light
lager
but
not
even
close
to
a
craft
beer
i
used
to
buy
kegs
of
this
stuff
for
parties
because
it
was
cheap
and
decent
now
that
im
a
bonafide
connoisseur
did
it
still
hold
up
to
the
test
off
the
tap
at
a
boston
airport
it
was
a
deep
amber
color
with
some
ruby
hues
the
onefinger
tan
head
retained
decently
but
left
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
and
caramel
malt
with
some
faint
hops
in
the
background
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
toasted
malt
and
hints
of
caramel
malt
with
a
nutty
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
slick
the
carbonation
mediumlow
and
the
body
medium
i
can
see
now
why
i
did
purchase
it
in
bulk
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
macro
beers
available
the
price
is
good
and
it
is
genuinely
sessionable
even
if
unremarkable
in
a
simular
vein
as
sa
boston
lager
shiner
bock
itll
work
in
fact
it
is
working
just
fine
right
now
this
is
a
great
go
to
beer
pours
a
nice
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
provides
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
purely
a
strong
malty
profile
the
initial
tastes
provides
malts
in
a
big
way
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
towards
the
end
the
finish
is
somewhat
metallic
and
leaves
an
odd
flavor
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
syrupy
side
which
is
not
really
something
i
look
for
in
an
irish
red
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
and
is
not
a
bad
choice
in
restaurants
that
dont
have
anything
but
macros
on
tap
drinkability
goes
down
very
smooth
its
not
going
to
be
my
first
choice
to
buy
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
if
it
was
offered
nice
and
refreshing
pours
a
clear
redamber
colored
body
very
light
in
color
with
almost
no
head
fine
bubbles
white
and
diminishing
has
a
very
malty
aroma
not
much
aroma
very
malty
taste
nutty
semibitter
aftertaste
fizzy
d
true
session
beer
and
regular
beer
for
my
taste
but
prolly
a
departure
into
micro
beers
from
the
macro
fellows
i
remember
this
beer
getting
lots
of
reviews
about
ten
years
ago
now
and
has
done
well
to
make
consumers
think
its
an
import
pretty
drinkable
because
of
the
lightness
i
guess
its
easy
to
drink
if
you
overlook
the
grainy
taste
i
couldnt
so
i
sipped
it
so
i
wouldnt
be
asked
if
i
wanted
another
more
pungent
smell
this
time
around
malty
sweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
must
have
some
added
sugars
to
get
it
this
sweet
could
use
some
more
hops
date
on
bottle
says
june
2
2014
so
it
might
be
a
bit
old
overall
a
decent
product
might
be
a
good
cross
over
beer
d
a
pretty
bland
lager
but
it
is
still
drinkable
it
is
similar
to
yuengling
lager
and
other
amber
beers
to
me
w
something
more
in
the
taste
i
would
order
this
over
a
light
or
american
pale
lager
d
very
easy
drinking
for
an
irish
red
good
for
a
euro
dark
lager
i
have
found
my
next
favorite
beer
this
was
creamy
thick
and
hearty
no
ting
of
heavy
larger
taste
and
overhang
smooth
malty
and
absolutely
incredibly
drinkable
will
savor
this
forever
and
ever
wish
i
would
have
found
this
delight
earlier
in
my
beer
drinking
career
d
this
beer
seems
to
be
an
attempt
at
removing
anything
anyone
might
find
objectionable
in
a
beer
as
such
it
is
easy
drinking
but
then
again
so
is
kool
aid
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
a
beer
of
note
either
i
often
think
of
this
as
my
go
to
beer
when
i
am
in
a
restaurant
without
any
nonbmc
choices
anyways
what
can
i
say
about
it
its
appearance
is
dark
amber
the
thing
i
like
about
this
most
is
the
smell
the
combination
of
caramel
and
malts
is
appealing
to
me
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
what
you
would
expect
bitter
taste
and
some
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
bright
amber
color
with
excellent
clarity
and
a
decent
sized
head
that
puts
a
bit
of
lace
around
the
glass
decent
aroma
with
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
smell
and
a
grainy
character
about
it
the
taste
is
similar
as
the
grainy
bready
taste
dominates
the
flavor
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
thrown
in
but
overall
a
pretty
watery
taste
mouthfeel
is
decent
being
about
medium
to
light
bodied
and
lacking
a
bit
in
carbonation
much
better
on
tap
than
bottle
d
back
in
the
day
this
wasnt
too
bad
i
think
ill
pass
and
grab
a
blue
moon
from
coors
next
time
aside
from
that
i
guess
for
being
moderately
priced
it
isnt
bad
and
is
a
decent
enough
alternative
to
bring
if
you
are
going
to
be
surrounded
by
bud
light
drinkers
had
this
out
of
a
keg
where
someone
got
a
keg
of
killians
is
beyond
me
just
awful
poured
bright
red
with
an
offwhite
head
metal
and
sour
mash
in
the
aroma
ultragrainy
taste
with
a
bizarre
fakecaramel
back
the
more
you
drank
the
worse
taste
it
accumulated
average
beer
masquerading
as
a
craft
brew
a
la
henry
weinhards
this
beer
actually
made
me
wish
the
keg
was
full
of
miller
lite
i
hate
you
george
killian
if
you
do
exist
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
light
and
smooth
enough
to
swill
down
at
a
cookout
with
some
good
grilled
meats
good
drinkability
it
poured
into
my
tumbler
a
dark
copper
red
with
a
decent
amount
of
offwhite
head
but
the
lace
was
lacking
in
any
type
staying
power
it
was
little
grainy
in
the
aroma
with
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
was
alright
there
were
hop
and
grainy
tones
combined
with
just
a
little
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
and
had
a
lot
fizz
bite
not
bad
i
guess
i
would
go
with
it
being
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
d
certainly
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
the
big
3
at
its
price
ill
certainly
buy
it
again
dthe
aftertaste
does
not
lend
itself
to
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
i
will
probably
not
return
to
drinking
too
many
more
of
these
it
has
a
reddish
body
with
a
mediumsized
head
but
is
almost
completely
devoid
of
any
type
of
smell
other
than
hops
this
beer
appears
to
have
potential
but
is
corrupted
by
a
level
of
bitterness
that
is
only
disrupted
by
a
watery
taste
that
is
typical
in
most
coors
products
the
aftertaste
was
a
combination
of
these
two
factors
and
i
could
not
finish
the
bottle
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
not
a
favorite
but
good
for
something
a
little
different
d
this
is
what
i
go
for
if
everything
else
on
tap
is
a
macro
not
bad
overall
pours
a
nice
clear
reddish
amber
almost
a
mahogany
with
a
finebubbled
head
aroma
is
typically
malty
with
hints
of
spice
mainly
cloves
jazzy
flavor
is
fairly
typical
of
a
dark
lager
but
has
a
touch
of
spice
to
it
finish
is
fairly
smooth
and
satisfying
pours
a
dark
rustic
red
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
fast
smells
of
sweet
malts
with
a
small
spice
touch
a
very
watery
beer
with
some
spices
and
carbonation
i
feel
like
killians
is
like
waterdown
budweiser
with
spices
and
sweet
malts
its
actually
a
decent
beer
extremely
drinkably
with
a
great
mouthfeel
the
first
one
tastes
the
same
as
the
last
drinkability
i
dont
think
i
ever
plan
on
having
another
one
of
these
ever
again
nice
brownred
color
sweet
crisp
taste
with
very
very
mild
hoppy
finish
this
beer
doesnt
have
alot
to
offer
but
its
an
upgrade
over
typical
us
beers
available
at
most
resturaunts
abd
bars
that
have
a
limited
beer
menu
ie
crud
crud
light
poors
light
miller
smite
i
dont
recomend
this
probably
wont
drink
again
because
there
are
better
reds
out
there
not
too
much
to
add
to
this
runofthemill
dark
lager
simple
roasted
malt
aroma
with
high
graininess
and
a
bit
of
a
chlorine
whiff
unfortunately
doesnt
offend
and
the
carbonation
is
balanced
well
with
the
weight
for
a
macrolager
pretty
decent
drinkability
for
a
brew
without
much
excitement
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
if
you
dont
want
to
shell
out
for
heinie
dark
and
check
out
the
nearly
indestructible
bottles
seriously
throw
them
at
anything
d
this
was
my
all
time
favorite
mainstream
beer
until
i
was
introduced
to
the
sam
adams
lines
it
still
has
a
lot
of
drinkability
value
even
after
all
is
put
together
overall
not
terrible
but
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
pay
for
a
very
decent
brew
this
beer
has
a
nice
reddish
color
as
described
in
the
name
of
it
average
head
retention
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
few
off
bitter
notes
i
found
the
bitter
notes
to
throw
off
the
feel
of
this
beer
i
can
appreciate
bitterness
but
it
just
didnt
seem
to
belong
in
this
brew
overall
the
bitterness
is
overlooked
as
this
is
a
respectable
beer
d
not
bad
not
great
but
not
bad
i
got
it
because
it
was
on
special
1
a
pint
at
the
sports
bar
that
didnt
have
much
else
this
one
was
a
real
stinker
for
me
first
off
i
think
its
weird
that
killians
irish
red
is
listed
as
a
euro
dark
lager
not
an
irish
red
but
whatever
the
taste
didnt
sit
well
at
all
with
me
way
too
malty
it
seemed
and
not
enough
balance
in
the
beer
almost
hard
to
swallow
i
try
this
often
and
try
to
like
it
but
just
cant
retried
this
over
the
past
weekend
after
a
few
years
away
from
it
worse
than
i
remembered
poured
a
brownish
red
with
a
slight
foamy
head
nose
is
of
yeast
and
malt
and
the
taste
follows
suit
not
much
character
to
this
beer
and
just
malt
plus
slight
hopd
euro
dark
lager
its
drinkable
and
better
than
most
coors
products
the
rest
simple
malt
flavor
with
toasted
grain
not
much
of
it
though
and
its
a
bit
thin
it
has
its
place
but
it
is
going
to
stay
in
my
past
drinkability
is
moderate
to
low
this
beer
is
certainly
sessionable
however
there
isnt
much
about
it
that
makes
me
want
to
go
back
for
more
the
flavors
are
subpar
and
leads
to
a
somewhat
disappointing
experience
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beer
easy
to
drink
and
cheap
what
do
you
expect
from
such
a
highly
produced
beer
poured
a
transparent
redamber
with
a
scant
quarter
inch
head
that
faded
quickly
into
a
faint
lace
started
off
on
a
bad
note
already
the
smell
was
also
faint
and
very
dilute
i
caught
some
light
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
but
not
much
else
somewhat
metallic
as
well
and
a
bit
of
sulfur
the
taste
was
very
much
like
the
smell
faint
and
light
with
coppery
tones
the
hops
barely
clung
to
the
malts
and
fell
apart
as
i
drank
i
was
pretty
disappointed
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
light
and
well
carbonated
hardly
enough
body
for
an
irish
red
but
i
guess
i
shouldnt
compare
with
smithwicks
decent
drinkability
as
i
chugged
it
down
quickly
to
get
a
guinness
instead
wouldnt
get
this
again
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
nothing
special
and
considerably
toned
down
from
when
it
was
originally
introduced
20
years
ago
as
an
ale
tastes
crisp
goes
down
smooth
but
thats
about
it
these
days
it
pretty
much
just
tastes
like
red
coors
lacking
the
more
alelike
qualities
it
had
some
years
ago
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
years
so
i
decided
to
revisit
it
my
palate
has
become
more
discerning
since
then
so
my
impression
of
the
lager
is
different
i
guess
i
am
more
particular
i
also
had
forgotten
that
coors
brewing
brews
killians
killians
irish
red
is
one
of
their
better
products
probably
the
most
drinakable
beer
i
had
this
afternoon
wasnt
overly
great
but
was
more
drinkable
i
had
a
nice
thick
biege
head
on
its
reddish
brown
body
the
smell
was
wheatish
with
some
smells
of
sweet
bread
the
taste
was
bitter
with
a
hint
of
cherry
sneaking
out
in
the
finish
it
had
a
sudsy
feel
as
it
washed
over
my
tongue
with
a
medium
body
it
was
more
drinkable
then
most
of
the
stuff
i
had
today
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
tapers
off
not
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
ends
up
on
the
glass
slightly
malty
sweet
and
roasty
but
also
rather
watery
leaving
a
thin
mouthfeel
its
alright
and
its
certainly
reasonably
priced
i
would
put
this
in
the
same
class
as
michelob
amber
bock
and
yuengling
but
id
prefer
those
two
over
this
one
this
beer
helped
me
find
other
beers
i
enjoy
far
more
and
its
good
for
what
it
is
bottle
poured
a
light
amber
color
beer
with
an
average
size
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
light
caramel
malt
is
not
the
most
complex
but
still
somewhat
enjoyable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
medium
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
limited
complexity
but
also
no
adjunct
as
i
had
feared
to
be
found
body
is
about
average
with
some
ok
carbonation
i
guess
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
considering
the
brewer
but
this
is
still
not
something
i
would
seek
again
back
in
the
day
this
beer
was
one
of
those
extra
special
beers
and
i
was
in
ohh
high
school
and
it
was
about
1987
the
beer
world
and
certainly
mine
has
changed
and
so
has
my
opinion
of
killians
irish
red
besides
a
descent
color
and
bit
of
extra
malt
flavor
i
would
put
it
in
the
mgd
category
sorry
george
overall
an
acceptable
brew
considering
its
a
coors
product
its
easy
to
locate
and
reasonablypriced
a
decent
everyday
type
of
beer
to
drink
with
your
friends
at
your
next
summer
bbq
this
beer
isnt
worth
trying
i
would
rather
have
something
of
better
quality
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
killians
i
like
its
appearance
nice
color
and
the
smell
is
pleaseant
but
it
looses
it
from
there
it
just
tastes
like
many
other
massproduced
larger
styles
that
sting
the
tongue
i
will
drink
killians
irish
red
if
there
isnt
a
better
microbrewed
brand
available
as
for
me
it
is
not
my
first
choice
or
second
pours
a
very
nice
but
shortlived
head
that
accents
truly
lovely
auburnred
color
and
supplies
a
decent
lacing
as
it
is
consumed
the
nose
is
a
softly
sweet
caramel
and
the
taste
is
sweet
on
the
palate
but
with
not
enough
hop
to
finish
briskly
overall
quite
drinkable
reddish
amber
looks
with
a
mild
head
and
continuous
fizz
a
weak
smell
with
slight
hints
of
grain
an
even
weaker
taste
awaits
this
is
coors
light
with
red
food
dye
this
brew
is
quite
boring
and
lacks
flavor
slight
grainy
taste
is
followed
by
stale
after
effect
that
sleeps
on
your
tongue
after
downing
half
of
a
glass
it
takes
buddhist
mind
power
to
stomach
any
more
sips
my
advice
is
to
leave
this
brew
on
the
shelf
drinking
a
whole
6pack
of
these
is
a
daunting
task
that
i
cant
imagine
completing
with
a
smile
though
there
is
no
wow
factor
for
this
beer
it
is
pretty
darn
good
considering
the
source
drinkable
sure
but
so
is
diet
coke
dont
think
ill
get
any
more
after
this
sixer
bites
the
dust
not
offensive
at
all
but
it
lacks
in
richness
emergency
situations
at
bars
would
have
me
call
for
this
beer
again
d
although
it
wasnt
bad
tasting
the
abundance
of
toasted
malt
without
the
balancing
sweetness
wasnt
something
i
wanted
to
keep
experiencing
its
always
nice
to
see
the
big
breweries
market
special
beers
under
other
names
at
first
i
thought
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
of
course
that
was
seven
years
ago
i
was
in
college
and
my
usual
assortment
consisted
of
busch
or
maybe
budweiser
if
i
had
some
more
change
lying
around
overall
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
really
lacks
in
the
flavor
department
especially
if
it
is
served
real
cold
this
one
is
not
too
high
on
my
list
but
there
are
worse
beers
out
there
drinkability
along
with
the
yummy
color
the
other
thing
i
liked
about
this
beer
very
smooth
finish
and
suprisingly
light
body
make
it
really
drinkable
i
hadnt
had
killians
in
years
after
a
recent
softball
game
it
was
between
this
corona
and
bud
light
lime
i
choose
the
lesser
of
three
evils
10
years
ago
i
actually
used
to
enjoy
this
on
tap
at
a
irish
pub
that
i
frequented
in
germany
these
days
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
measure
up
there
is
nothing
outstanding
about
the
beer
im
not
sure
if
its
me
but
i
frequently
get
the
taste
of
a
rusted
bottle
cap
when
drinking
this
im
not
sure
if
thats
the
taste
their
shooting
for
but
it
is
what
it
is
again
i
choose
this
over
corona
and
bud
light
lime
which
one
would
you
have
chosen
if
you
were
in
my
shoes
enough
said
was
something
that
was
not
great
going
down
and
i
would
avoid
it
when
possible
better
than
a
lot
of
bmc
offerings
but
still
below
par
d
also
very
drinkable
a
good
go
to
beer
in
times
of
struggle
very
pleasing
goes
good
with
many
varieties
of
food
the
only
thing
i
can
think
where
this
beverage
can
be
made
better
is
by
not
making
it
have
much
head
in
it
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
and
i
kept
finding
myself
wanting
another
sip
i
could
easily
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
i
bummed
one
of
these
from
my
room
mate
and
i
would
consider
buying
if
the
price
was
significantly
lower
than
any
good
micros
or
there
were
only
macros
to
be
had
d
its
ok
in
a
pinch
this
brew
pours
a
red
color
and
has
a
fizzy
beige
head
the
nose
has
cardboard
and
some
leathery
malts
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
some
sweet
mild
malt
and
not
much
else
decent
medium
body
but
heavy
carbonation
this
is
a
marginal
beer
that
goes
down
easy
better
on
tap
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
sticky
side
overall
not
as
great
as
i
remember
it
to
be
but
not
bad
d
these
are
easy
to
put
down
and
smooth
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
it
isnt
top
quality
pours
a
golden
red
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
head
retention
was
not
bad
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
like
grain
and
carmel
malt
with
a
bit
of
hopps
not
really
a
fresh
smell
but
not
skunk
either
the
taste
is
well
balanced
not
powerful
before
during
or
after
roasted
malts
and
hopps
followed
by
a
sweet
hopp
finish
overall
not
a
bad
brew
easy
drinking
slightly
sweet
nothing
really
happening
in
the
hoppiness
arena
it
is
better
when
its
cold
too
its
not
bad
for
the
price
beats
the
lighter
versions
of
easy
drinking
brew
it
has
a
smell
that
is
quite
pleasant
and
is
the
most
noteworthy
aspect
of
this
beer
nowadays
d
pretty
good
beer
not
much
of
a
standout
but
i
could
drink
a
few
mfd
bland
bland
bland
mouthfeel
its
a
step
up
from
the
average
offering
from
an
mfd
but
its
still
exceedingly
watery
when
you
compare
this
to
a
true
irish
red
like
murphys
red
or
smithwicks
its
not
even
in
the
same
league
for
a
mass
market
low
budget
beer
its
okay
but
i
wouldnt
pay
money
for
it
pours
a
nice
redamber
color
with
decent
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
has
a
nice
malty
scent
slightly
cloying
but
in
a
bad
way
good
taste
well
balanced
a
nice
malty
flavor
to
it
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
aftertaste
goes
down
pretty
well
while
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
of
beer
its
a
nicely
done
macro
lager
m
d
a
little
foamy
carbonation
a
lighter
body
and
refreshing
nothing
mind
blowing
but
quite
easy
to
drink
pretty
straight
forward
and
light
probably
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
overall
a
step
up
from
standard
bmc
beers
but
not
very
good
notes
i
would
not
waste
my
time
buying
this
beerbut
if
at
a
gathering
and
offered
one
i
would
take
it
over
a
corona
d
in
terms
of
being
waterlike
its
easily
drinkable
but
lack
of
any
pleasure
from
it
takes
that
right
away
this
beer
is
ok
considering
the
usual
price
but
why
not
skip
a
couple
of
six
packs
of
killians
and
save
for
something
better
has
no
business
being
consumed
on
st
pats
it
is
neither
irish
nor
is
it
in
the
style
of
anything
irish
drinkability
a
real
letdown
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
medium
copper
forming
a
12
inch
tan
head
which
leaves
very
small
spots
of
lace
behind
the
aroma
is
very
maly
and
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
malts
and
grain
the
taste
really
reminds
me
of
a
malt
liqour
mainly
olde
english
but
not
as
bad
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
an
easy
enough
drinker
except
that
the
flavor
is
lacking
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
but
not
something
that
ill
keep
on
hand
not
a
beer
to
which
ill
return
thankfully
i
honestly
dont
drink
coors
products
usually
i
certainly
dont
buy
them
largely
due
to
the
extremist
politics
of
the
coors
family
ive
certainly
had
far
better
but
among
macros
this
at
least
isnt
the
worst
not
thin
in
the
mmouth
with
at
least
a
medium
body
a
little
fizzy
more
substantial
that
the
other
macros
that
come
out
of
golden
co
appearance
redamber
in
color
two
finger
off
white
head
but
not
much
lacing
smell
some
sweet
caremel
malt
maby
some
rosted
notes
not
much
else
taste
some
malt
sweetness
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
not
much
to
brag
about
though
mouthfeel
mediem
body
high
carbonation
drinkability
ok
for
a
mass
market
beer
company
if
your
looking
for
somthing
great
go
somewhere
else
anyway
back
to
the
beer
pours
a
nice
ambercopper
color
with
about
a
one
finger
head
which
quickly
disapears
mild
aroma
faint
malt
smell
taste
is
similarly
mild
and
balanced
with
light
malt
and
hops
taste
mouthfeel
again
is
sort
of
middle
of
the
road
nothing
great
but
nothing
awful
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
there
probably
should
be
a
new
category
such
as
american
macro
craft
or
something
for
these
beers
which
are
somewhere
in
between
budweiser
and
sam
adams
as
a
mass
market
beer
it
is
pretty
good
but
if
i
am
going
for
a
beer
like
this
i
would
probably
grab
a
yuengling
here
in
pa
a
simple
easydrinking
beer
with
some
flavor
much
better
from
the
tap
like
this
ill
have
this
from
time
to
time
when
i
just
want
a
thoughtless
macro
this
is
relatively
drinkable
especially
if
you
pinch
your
nose
to
avoid
the
horrific
smell
first
i
dont
particularly
care
for
killians
and
depending
on
my
mood
may
actually
drink
it
but
most
of
the
time
i
avoid
it
its
a
good
first
step
for
those
progressing
from
the
standard
massproduced
beers
to
the
finer
ones
but
its
something
that
most
people
with
taste
move
beyond
the
quest
for
a
better
beer
is
soon
met
by
a
multitude
of
others
md
mouthfeel
was
about
average
the
carbonation
present
in
the
brew
was
rather
light
albeit
consistent
this
in
and
of
itself
isnt
bad
but
there
wasnt
much
else
there
to
bring
up
the
mouthfeel
at
all
i
dont
know
if
this
is
something
i
would
ever
ask
for
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
if
offered
i
used
to
think
this
was
great
beer
before
i
had
ever
had
great
beer
now
its
very
hard
to
drink
but
i
found
that
with
pizza
choosing
between
bud
light
and
kilians
is
easypass
the
darker
beer
please
in
bottle
form
its
really
bad
on
tap
its
fine
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
what
head
there
is
dissipates
very
quickly
into
nothing
hints
of
sweet
malts
and
mild
graininess
in
the
aroma
im
not
picking
up
much
more
in
the
smell
flavor
is
pretty
good
and
sweet
candy
malts
and
toffee
right
up
front
however
it
quickly
turns
into
a
terrible
skunk
tastefinish
this
bottle
may
be
a
victim
of
light
damage
i
am
not
sure
mouthfeel
is
between
thin
and
moderatebodied
with
good
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
if
the
skunkiness
wasnt
apparent
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
but
it
greatly
hinders
the
drinkability
factor
mediocre
this
was
actually
one
of
my
training
beers
back
in
college
and
wow
have
my
tastes
changed
poured
into
a
pint
glass
transparent
red
with
plenty
of
carbonation
bubbles
floating
through
head
was
mediocre
at
best
and
died
off
fast
smell
was
funky
but
not
skunked
a
bit
metallic
with
some
minor
hops
barried
in
there
very
oily
on
my
tongue
and
carbonated
the
metallic
tastes
comes
back
to
me
here
and
im
getting
some
sweet
almost
artificial
sugar
flavors
i
really
feel
like
a
beer
snob
now
i
have
no
desire
to
finish
the
pack
as
it
took
me
longer
than
id
like
to
finish
one
more
interesting
for
me
to
go
back
to
something
i
once
thought
wasnt
a
bad
beverage
mouthfeel
is
soso
sudsy
and
chewy
enough
for
this
particular
brew
overall
an
easy
beer
to
drink
nothing
exciting
but
not
disgusting
overall
not
all
that
bad
ice
cold
and
on
tap
easy
enough
to
drink
i
use
to
drink
this
all
the
time
in
college
i
thought
this
was
great
stuff
compared
to
bmc
which
i
guess
it
is
all
in
all
a
beer
that
one
of
the
big
boys
made
to
make
people
think
they
are
drinking
a
premium
beer
though
i
still
drink
it
from
time
to
time
if
nothing
else
is
available
at
a
bar
all
in
all
average
beer
when
nothing
else
is
available
m
d
very
smooth
low
carbonation
about
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
several
of
them
its
still
better
than
most
commercial
beers
but
not
by
much
if
you
enjoyed
partaking
of
the
occasional
mouthful
from
the
sandbox
as
a
kid
this
beer
just
might
be
for
you
otherwise
choose
one
of
the
many
other
superior
ambersreds
out
there
for
about
the
same
money
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
received
very
little
head
from
this
transparent
golden
hue
with
touch
of
red
brew
the
smell
is
very
faint
of
hops
and
that
is
it
the
taste
is
similiar
to
other
coors
products
with
some
slight
tweaking
the
mouthfeel
is
very
slick
and
plain
mostly
water
and
there
is
some
slight
malts
on
the
backend
that
make
it
different
compared
to
other
dark
euros
or
irish
reds
this
is
complete
garbage
but
compared
to
its
macro
brethern
it
is
not
that
bad
my
mom
hates
beer
but
will
drink
this
once
in
a
while
i
will
finish
the
review
on
that
note
for
what
it
is
not
bad
if
you
let
it
warm
a
little
more
than
fridge
temps
it
actually
shows
some
decent
flavor
and
aroma
surprising
actually
pours
a
transparent
amberorange
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
is
off
white
looks
great
for
a
macro
especially
visible
carbonation
rising
aroma
is
a
little
bit
macro
like
a
bit
of
sweet
aroma
and
a
very
little
bit
of
hop
aromas
doesnt
smell
noticeably
fresh
overall
not
the
best
aroma
but
nothing
awful
taste
is
rather
macro
like
and
more
so
than
i
remember
it
even
ice
cold
it
has
that
adjunct
flavor
a
strange
sweetness
that
is
not
malts
its
a
bit
better
than
the
pale
macro
stuff
but
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
the
color
difference
was
mostly
a
dye
ive
had
this
on
tap
in
the
past
on
occasion
and
thought
it
was
decent
but
not
quite
sure
why
at
this
point
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
and
demoed
it
before
i
passed
it
on
as
a
beer
for
friends
to
drink
reminds
me
a
bit
of
yuengling
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
the
style
medium
light
while
its
not
as
undrinkable
as
a
budweiser
id
rather
not
say
its
drinkable
its
really
not
an
irish
red
probably
not
even
a
euro
dark
lager
if
i
ever
dare
be
confused
enough
to
drink
this
again
i
want
to
warn
myself
to
remember
that
its
distinctly
an
american
macro
amber
lager
and
nothing
more
d
not
real
my
bag
someone
was
thinking
that
this
was
up
my
alley
but
it
was
a
sad
disappointment
for
the
both
of
us
this
one
aint
bad
had
this
ontap
served
unfortunately
in
chilled
mugs
reddish
amber
color
that
is
crystalclear
some
fluffylooking
head
quickly
goes
leaving
little
lacing
behind
smell
is
pretty
clean
mostly
sweet
malts
taste
is
quite
bready
kind
of
like
biting
into
a
pillsbury
roll
fruity
notes
are
also
present
most
notably
orange
and
lemon
feels
extremely
thin
though
will
enough
carbonation
to
do
the
trick
finishes
bone
dry
there
is
definitely
better
beer
out
there
however
in
a
pinch
this
will
do
just
fine
i
would
say
this
beer
is
pretty
good
nothing
over
the
top
the
smell
is
pretty
sweet
it
also
doesnt
have
that
hopiness
to
it
the
appereance
is
obviously
red
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
taste
to
it
it
ends
pretty
abrupt
after
it
goes
down
no
big
aftertaste
at
all
d
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
with
a
meal
its
not
bad
i
was
turned
on
to
this
beer
by
a
louisiana
roomate
of
mine
it
is
a
beer
that
is
offered
by
many
and
has
a
somewhat
decent
taste
to
it
i
can
truley
say
that
i
have
a
hangover
without
a
bad
drink
go
ahead
and
order
this
one
it
is
good
wihyh
cheap
food
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
best
by
date
on
the
neck
it
was
an
amber
color
with
decent
carb
and
no
lacing
it
had
a
small
head
that
evaporated
quickly
the
aroma
was
weak
malt
and
kinda
skunky
the
taste
was
mostly
bland
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
separate
it
from
the
macros
mouthfeel
was
watery
while
ill
always
have
fond
memories
of
this
one
ive
grown
up
and
its
stayed
the
same
not
again
i
cannot
drink
too
much
of
this
or
i
will
get
sick
leaves
a
washy
feeling
in
my
stomach
notes
something
i
bought
once
prior
to
beer
advocate
knowledge
thinking
it
was
better
than
a
macro
knowing
know
i
know
this
beer
is
nothing
more
than
decent
i
would
definitely
reach
for
this
before
many
other
macros
but
i
could
think
of
hundreds
of
other
beers
i
would
rather
try
pours
an
attractive
amber
color
with
an
inch
or
so
white
head
so
far
so
good
taste
is
fairly
bland
some
malt
maybe
a
hint
of
bitterness
could
be
hops
but
tough
to
make
out
the
flavor
nice
pleasant
beer
but
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
for
the
price
there
are
lots
better
carbonationmouthfeel
was
pleasant
d
i
tend
to
drink
killians
when
i
plan
on
getting
drunk
not
sure
if
it
is
ba
sacreligious
to
like
a
beer
for
quantity
edit
i
stupidly
decided
to
buy
this
shit
when
it
went
on
sale
again
it
is
even
worse
now
i
dont
know
if
this
is
because
i
have
developed
my
beer
palate
more
or
because
it
just
somehow
got
worse
slight
bitter
taste
that
is
not
a
hoppiness
but
has
more
skunk
character
these
bottles
were
hidden
from
light
in
a
12
pack
fuck
i
have
11
more
of
these
and
arent
out
of
date
pretty
decent
beer
to
drink
if
its
on
special
i
know
its
made
by
coors
but
it
has
a
good
malty
after
taste
that
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
macro
its
a
great
session
beer
because
you
sometimes
can
get
a
good
deal
on
a
20
pack
to
some
it
up
i
would
say
it
is
one
of
the
better
average
beers
not
a
bad
beer
basically
the
budweiser
of
red
lagers
i
know
this
comes
from
one
of
the
major
players
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
in
places
that
arent
diverse
in
beers
it
has
a
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
i
think
it
has
an
inviting
smell
the
taste
has
a
little
sweet
hoppy
flavor
in
my
mouth
it
had
a
light
carbonation
and
was
very
smooth
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
good
beers
thats
light
enough
to
drink
all
night
very
enjoyable
for
the
style
of
beer
cheap
american
produced
brew
it
is
better
than
most
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
starts
with
a
decent
albeit
simple
caramel
malt
aroma
but
goes
downhill
from
there
the
flavor
holds
the
nice
caramel
at
first
but
it
gives
way
to
a
very
unpleasant
almost
acidic
bitterness
thats
not
fun
at
all
this
beer
isnt
even
inoffensive
id
drink
one
if
given
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
finish
it
overall
ive
had
better
beers
i
have
certainly
had
worse
beers
it
is
a
fine
one
for
the
price
i
know
that
sometimes
this
is
a
sorta
permium
on
tap
at
resaurants
and
i
would
pick
it
over
the
bmc
stuff
any
day
retried
this
over
the
past
weekend
after
a
few
years
away
from
it
better
than
i
remembered
pours
a
brownish
red
with
a
slight
foamy
head
that
is
retained
throughout
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
yeast
and
malt
and
the
taste
follows
suit
crisp
and
refreshing
not
much
character
to
this
beer
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
choice
to
have
with
a
burger
or
steak
could
drink
three
of
four
of
these
drinkability
is
great
this
brew
is
crisp
and
clean
without
complexity
or
overbearing
flavors
it
remains
well
balanced
and
plays
off
subtle
flavors
to
create
a
solid
dark
lager
cheers
drinkability
these
are
smooth
and
light
so
they
go
down
quite
easily
although
this
isnt
even
close
to
my
favorite
beer
its
something
i
can
have
when
im
not
looking
for
something
complex
available
unlike
potatoes
in
a
blight
tasty
earthyspicy
beer
doesnt
look
like
much
clean
as
a
whistle
reddish
like
ohoulahan
in
color
smells
like
the
barlye
in
the
wind
like
spicy
cabbage
the
flavor
grows
from
the
roots
of
the
malt
low
hops
like
a
leprechaun
with
no
pot
o
gold
drink
for
sessions
drink
for
the
year
drink
for
the
laughter
drink
for
the
tear
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
too
sweet
for
my
taste
can
have
some
more
sips
of
this
one
definitely
dont
like
the
aftertaste
though
its
quite
a
bland
beer
solid
but
still
bland
d
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
really
it
did
not
impress
me
at
all
i
guess
its
drinkable
because
its
very
thin
but
the
alcoholic
taste
and
that
weird
aftertaste
was
too
much
of
an
onus
to
bear
about
halfway
through
the
thing
all
taste
even
the
alcohol
seems
to
dissipate
and
its
just
like
drinking
weird
carbonated
water
while
being
the
first
irish
red
beer
ive
had
it
was
very
good
the
reddish
amber
color
and
the
malty
flavor
all
made
my
pallate
explode
with
joy
the
overall
experience
of
this
beer
was
very
good
for
me
while
i
have
heard
other
people
say
that
this
isnt
the
best
one
out
there
i
enjoy
it
from
time
to
time
and
will
continue
to
do
so
i
had
this
on
tap
free
while
playing
at
casino
royale
in
vegas
i
chose
it
because
the
competing
beverages
were
nothing
special
and
also
because
10
years
ago
this
was
my
main
choice
at
home
call
it
my
gateway
beer
now
after
ive
seasoned
my
palate
a
little
i
can
say
that
while
it
quenches
thirst
it
is
not
the
most
tasty
of
malted
drinks
the
color
is
pleasingly
dark
amber
the
aroma
is
muted
malts
the
flavor
is
inoffensive
but
a
little
bitter
in
an
unsatisfying
way
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
goes
down
like
water
not
too
much
else
to
report
pours
a
bright
amber
color
almost
red
with
an
average
offwhite
head
the
head
dissipated
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
the
smell
is
grainy
and
on
the
sweet
side
not
all
that
appealing
the
brew
has
an
initial
taste
of
sweet
malt
but
is
quickly
followed
a
taste
of
grain
the
feel
is
light
and
watery
with
tight
carbonation
served
cold
this
is
a
light
and
refreshing
brew
easy
to
slug
back
one
notch
above
your
standard
macros
drinkability
well
that
one
is
out
of
the
way
i
will
not
seek
this
out
ill
only
have
this
as
a
last
resort
its
better
that
your
standard
macro
lager
but
there
are
many
other
eurodarks
that
blow
this
out
of
the
water
this
was
the
beer
of
the
month
at
bw3s
nice
red
amber
color
but
other
than
that
not
much
to
brag
about
it
had
a
lousy
head
and
not
much
after
taste
light
carbonation
with
a
little
sweetness
i
have
had
it
before
and
not
been
impressed
but
figured
it
was
worth
it
for
the
23oz
glass
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
forgetable
at
that
d
okay
but
maybe
a
bit
to
sweet
for
more
than
one
unless
that
is
you
serve
it
very
cold
average
drinkability
bc
there
was
nothing
great
about
this
beer
but
nothing
particualrly
off
or
unsettling
about
this
beer
overall
a
very
good
choice
when
stuck
with
nothing
better
for
its
price
and
considering
that
it
is
3point
it
isnt
bad
but
compared
to
to
other
maltylagers
i
e
full
sails
ltd
series
bottling
2
this
pretty
subpar
drinkability
could
knock
a
few
of
these
but
the
quality
is
just
about
the
same
as
a
bmc
nothing
really
to
differentiate
killians
poors
a
nice
looking
red
with
a
deacent
white
head
probobly
the
highlight
i
pick
up
a
slight
smell
of
malts
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
not
much
different
with
malts
wraped
up
in
a
dry
finish
i
could
easily
drink
a
bunch
of
these
not
much
to
it
nothing
special
d
i
coulod
see
this
one
as
a
high
class
college
bong
beer
if
it
was
free
yea
i
would
take
it
but
you
wont
see
me
buying
this
one
any
time
soon
drinkability
aside
from
the
beer
being
pretty
onedimensional
isnt
too
poor
theres
nothing
extremely
flawed
so
although
there
isnt
much
character
i
could
drink
a
few
on
the
mainstream
ticket
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
pouring
a
crimson
gold
with
lively
carbonation
the
head
sticks
around
for
the
party
and
even
leaves
some
lace
for
added
comfort
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
heavy
here
an
enjoyable
beer
poured
a
nice
reddish
amber
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
decent
lace
ringed
down
the
glass
and
some
nice
chains
of
bubbles
formed
visible
carbonation
smell
was
bready
with
a
hint
of
bittering
hops
but
mostly
cereal
like
taste
was
smooth
non
descript
and
very
sessionable
lots
of
malts
and
thats
about
it
overall
not
bad
but
doesnt
stand
out
in
a
crowd
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
used
to
think
of
as
good
back
in
college
im
not
sure
if
its
gotten
worse
or
ive
gotten
more
discriminating
since
then
either
way
this
one
was
not
good
thats
for
sure
look
is
your
standard
amber
color
some
lighter
highlights
just
a
little
head
that
goes
away
pretty
quickly
nose
is
nonexistent
this
beer
has
no
smell
taste
is
a
little
better
sort
of
slightly
roasted
malt
a
little
caramel
nothing
much
else
feel
is
thin
standard
macro
in
my
opinion
this
is
better
than
those
crap
macrolagers
although
not
much
8211
i
have
since
been
forced
to
revisit
this
recently
and
suffice
it
to
say
its
not
as
good
as
i
remember
when
my
only
frame
of
reference
was
adjunct
lagers
and
malt
liquor
apprearance
out
of
the
bottle
its
formed
a
nice
head
almost
2
inches
that
lasted
for
quite
a
while
and
settled
to
a
light
foamy
top
color
is
a
rusty
brown
smell
was
a
kind
of
a
nutty
carmel
malt
the
taste
is
roasted
bitterness
mouthfeel
has
a
stronger
somewhat
dry
finish
that
i
dont
care
for
in
this
style
drinkable
beer
and
a
good
price
i
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
a
macrobrew
that
is
better
than
most
and
works
well
after
a
day
on
the
lawn
mower
or
to
keep
around
for
nonmicrodrinking
friends
it
would
be
more
drinkable
if
the
hop
bitterness
lingered
through
the
end
rather
than
only
showing
up
for
the
beginning
of
the
taste
profile
the
malty
finish
doesnt
leave
one
begging
for
more
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
from
the
coors
family
already
have
bought
this
before
a
few
times
when
going
out
to
eat
a
little
too
carbonated
felt
a
bit
fizzy
in
my
mouth
for
its
flavor
still
goes
down
easy
enough
avg
brew
but
worth
a
try
its
an
alright
beer
to
have
at
a
restaurant
if
you
have
limited
choices
not
a
favorite
but
better
than
most
macros
with
a
cheap
pricetag
d
anyone
could
probably
drink
this
all
night
if
it
wasnt
so
gassy
and
carbonatedor
if
it
was
the
standard
fare
and
nothing
better
was
offered
ive
had
it
ontap
and
for
many
years
in
bottles
as
an
inexpensive
offering
overall
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
for
its
style
diffinate
adjuncts
i
hate
when
one
of
the
macros
purports
to
be
something
its
not
miller
lite
calling
itself
a
pilsner
this
beer
calling
itself
an
irish
red
it
irks
me
despite
getting
off
on
the
wrong
foot
this
brew
is
one
of
the
better
american
macro
beers
its
a
light
amber
in
the
glass
but
wont
support
a
head
for
long
at
all
even
though
this
is
a
fresh
sample
and
i
gave
it
a
violent
pour
the
smell
is
fruity
with
a
caramel
sweetness
lingering
in
the
background
a
little
bit
of
grain
as
well
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
some
caramel
flavor
is
there
and
a
definite
fruitiness
that
reminds
me
strongly
of
challenger
hops
there
is
some
adjunt
sweetness
here
as
well
but
it
is
masked
better
in
this
brew
by
the
hops
and
darker
malt
than
in
other
macro
offerings
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
great
head
at
first
but
dissipiated
quickly
extremely
light
lacing
from
the
tan
head
the
color
is
a
nice
amber
red
which
looked
watery
as
it
ends
up
tasting
has
that
distinct
irish
red
taste
and
overall
ends
up
tasting
like
a
watered
down
smithwicks
to
a
point
very
easy
to
drink
though
and
could
see
myslef
downing
many
of
these
better
than
most
beers
made
in
america
but
not
quite
favorite
beer
material
the
feel
is
watery
but
it
has
a
slight
almost
ale
thickness
even
thought
its
a
lager
has
a
nice
pleasant
afterfeel
too
fizzy
at
first
dry
at
the
finish
the
malt
is
bitter
but
also
a
tiny
bit
sweet
overall
a
very
solid
beer
no
really
went
out
to
dinner
and
this
was
the
only
irish
stuff
they
had
on
tap
appearance
is
averagenice
red
body
with
white
head
strong
malt
smell
and
taste
mouthfeel
was
a
good
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
average
drinkabilitywhen
i
was
done
i
did
not
want
another
while
killians
has
more
positive
attributes
than
most
macros
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
make
a
regular
drink
d
this
is
a
descent
beer
great
for
the
price
i
would
rate
george
killians
irish
red
as
one
of
the
better
of
the
so
called
cheap
beers
i
just
picked
up
a
twelve
pack
on
sale
for
9
99
and
surprisingly
the
beer
wasnt
outdated
ive
always
felt
killians
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
without
the
horrible
aftertaste
that
afflicts
bud
michelob
etc
although
it
doesnt
compare
with
a
nice
microbrew
killians
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
your
wallet
is
a
little
light
mouthfeel
is
very
grainy
chalky
and
dry
this
is
the
beers
primary
drawback
rendering
it
much
less
drinkable
than
it
has
potential
to
be
i
have
had
to
be
driven
home
many
of
nights
after
drinking
this
beer
overall
i
had
forgotten
how
decent
this
brew
is
its
nothing
spectacular
but
its
certainly
worth
it
if
nothing
better
is
around
worth
a
try
other
than
some
caramelish
malt
theres
not
much
to
say
nothing
too
offensive
and
something
to
pick
when
the
choices
are
limited
to
a
few
macros
in
terms
of
drinkability
it
is
a
mild
and
easy
drinking
malt
forward
kind
of
beer
not
to
be
confused
with
a
primo
dark
german
lager
but
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
brew
notes
a
bud
lightdrinking
neighbor
brought
this
over
knowing
i
like
microbrews
i
suppose
coors
deserves
kudos
for
being
able
to
convince
some
folks
that
this
fits
the
bill
as
a
craftbrewed
beer
it
clearly
is
not
funny
thing
is
about
15
years
ago
i
would
sometimes
get
this
in
pitchers
at
certain
bars
as
it
was
1
darker
than
your
average
macro
lager
and
2
relatively
cheap
back
then
i
thought
it
wasnt
half
bad
for
what
it
was
either
my
tastes
have
evolved
or
this
brew
has
gotten
significantly
worse
because
nowadays
i
am
not
able
to
drink
this
not
getting
any
more
of
this
thank
heavens
it
was
given
to
me
and
i
didnt
have
to
pay
for
it
have
to
rate
slightly
above
average
because
this
is
a
go
to
draught
when
all
the
other
available
is
macro
especially
the
watered
down
varieties
usually
a
good
alternative
in
the
bottle
also
darker
amberred
body
with
very
little
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
smell
is
almost
entirely
caramel
malt
tastes
like
caramel
malt
but
not
very
strong
fairly
watery
in
flavor
and
mouth
feel
light
side
of
medium
bodied
seems
like
it
should
be
tastier
but
definitely
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
a
macrobrewer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
if
theres
no
sam
adams
sierra
nevada
or
local
craft
brews
etc
this
is
what
id
go
to
id
prefer
this
over
almost
any
other
macro
pours
a
redish
whiskey
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
at
all
smell
is
slightly
caramel
slightly
bready
taste
same
mouthfeel
nothing
special
very
plain
very
blah
beer
if
you
have
other
another
choice
take
it
hope
there
are
some
better
styles
of
this
beer
out
there
this
is
a
beer
ive
had
countless
times
would
never
buy
for
myself
and
was
down
to
drinking
after
all
else
was
gone
by
the
second
half
of
the
eagles
obliteration
of
the
cowboys
as
noted
previously
i
was
pleased
with
the
lack
of
any
real
adjunct
character
but
the
overall
soso
nature
of
the
beer
means
its
about
as
average
as
average
gets
so
that
means
its
lightish
way
makes
it
go
down
smooth
but
im
not
going
to
rave
about
that
just
because
average
is
all
i
was
left
with
so
i
dont
like
it
and
i
dont
dislike
it
it
doesnt
offend
me
and
it
doesnt
engage
me
it
just
doesnt
do
much
of
anything
really
except
go
down
then
get
forgotten
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
with
decent
retention
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
nothing
too
strong
taste
is
a
little
malty
sweetness
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
towards
the
middle
not
bad
when
nothing
else
is
available
not
great
either
killians
irish
red
comes
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
nicely
plotted
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
a
thin
pale
tan
blanket
it
has
very
little
lacing
but
it
makes
a
good
contrast
to
the
body
its
body
has
a
nice
amber
hue
but
seems
to
be
a
bit
thin
but
its
still
a
great
beer
to
look
at
this
beer
feels
a
little
dull
on
your
tongue
but
it
rolls
onto
your
mouth
very
smoothly
it
has
a
slightly
tart
taste
to
it
but
it
finishes
with
a
crisp
aftertaste
that
goes
down
with
no
problems
drinkability
was
ok
better
than
its
kin
and
possibly
i
bit
underrated
in
a
bad
pinch
it
could
work
mk
i
remember
this
beer
being
better
when
i
was
younger
d
first
issue
here
was
the
serving
temperature
i
could
barely
hold
the
glass
it
was
so
cold
so
i
admired
the
eye
candy
before
me
while
it
warmed
up
unfortunately
this
made
me
witness
to
the
head
disappearing
once
i
got
past
the
smell
it
was
very
drinkable
i
could
see
some
of
my
macroswill
drinking
friends
enjoying
this
had
i
not
run
out
of
food
i
would
have
had
another
to
finish
off
a
great
meal
a
copperish
red
color
with
light
carbonation
and
thin
head
s
light
hints
of
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
a
hopped
finish
t
semisweet
malts
with
a
little
hop
balance
that
is
muted
by
strong
hints
of
phenol
maybe
that
exude
a
kind
of
mildly
skunked
character
to
the
finishperhaps
this
is
what
disagrees
with
my
systemthis
is
not
altogether
unpleasant
and
is
variable
between
bottles
m
thin
but
enough
to
present
flavors
and
smoothness
d
i
would
classify
this
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
when
no
better
options
exist
i
will
continue
to
moderately
patronize
this
homage
to
irish
reds
bottom
line
id
say
this
is
a
decent
irish
lager
that
i
can
safely
say
i
would
highly
reccomend
to
any
irish
lager
fan
ta
ta
the
mouth
is
light
and
simple
it
lacks
character
and
has
this
unpleasnt
aftertastea
little
phenolic
its
better
than
some
of
the
macro
stuff
but
only
as
a
last
resort
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
its
not
a
great
beer
but
ok
this
brew
has
great
amber
red
color
and
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
lending
to
its
great
drinkabilty
good
carbonation
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
a
good
lace
it
has
a
nice
malt
taste
with
a
finish
that
just
a
touch
dry
always
a
good
standby
due
it
wide
availability
now
i
think
i
will
try
to
find
i
beer
i
really
hate
and
review
it
to
see
how
it
stacks
up
against
this
nothing
about
this
beer
is
special
but
nothing
is
all
that
terrible
either
meh
its
a
cheap
lager
thats
a
step
up
from
the
usual
dregs
coors
turns
out
so
there
you
have
it
not
greatworth
seeking
out
by
any
means
but
a
good
choice
if
the
other
options
are
just
downright
awful
flavor
is
sweet
malty
with
a
bit
of
hops
not
overpowering
it
holds
its
own
mouthfeel
is
clean
if
a
bit
thin
and
watery
it
wont
wow
you
with
flavor
and
its
nothing
you
havent
had
before
but
it
is
a
highly
drinkable
a
very
solid
beer
to
have
at
parties
or
just
watching
the
game
drinkabilitygoes
down
very
easily
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
a
glass
beer
mug
its
color
is
an
amberred
with
what
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
carbonation
a
smallish
tan
head
with
slight
lacing
it
is
hoppy
in
both
smell
and
taste
it
goes
down
smooth
not
too
bitter
this
is
an
average
beer
a
better
choice
than
bud
or
miller
if
those
are
your
choices
of
beer
on
tap
this
beer
sometimes
gets
a
bum
rap
this
stuff
is
my
favorite
beer
when
im
thirsty
and
need
a
drink
asap
its
very
drinkable
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
doesnt
fill
you
in
the
least
great
brew
for
st
patricks
day
when
you
got
to
get
more
then
a
few
in
you
for
being
a
mainstream
beer
and
brewed
by
my
least
favorite
company
coors
it
isnt
bad
its
light
has
a
nice
carbonation
nice
malt
taste
in
the
beginning
and
finishes
slightly
dry
dont
hate
get
my
buzz
onn
this
is
a
decent
beer
considering
the
source
apperance
is
a
red
amber
with
an
decent
head
leaving
minimal
lacing
taste
is
malty
with
a
grain
undertone
almost
sweet
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fairly
smooth
after
a
twelve
hour
day
of
travel
this
was
a
welcomed
beverage
at
the
hotel
pub
poured
to
a
bright
amber
red
with
medium
offwhite
head
that
lingered
awhile
and
then
left
okay
lacing
aroma
was
not
much
to
speak
of
as
it
was
hard
to
detect
much
of
anything
flavor
was
okay
slightly
malty
sweet
but
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
widely
available
brew
by
a
big
macrobrewer
george
killians
irish
red
was
a
red
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
head
soon
dissipated
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
spotty
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
malty
the
taste
was
light
sweet
malt
in
the
beginning
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
plenty
of
carbonation
its
a
pretty
average
beer
good
but
not
the
best
nice
to
have
at
partys
for
people
that
think
this
is
a
micro
brew
much
like
some
other
coors
products
i
e
blue
moon
drinkability
i
could
buy
a
case
of
this
beer
and
have
it
last
a
week
or
so
maybe
drinking
46
a
night
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
drank
it
while
eating
a
italian
meatball
sub
a
good
combination
d
nice
for
hanging
out
at
a
bar
and
watching
football
or
something
not
really
for
me
i
havent
had
this
brew
in
about
3
or
4
years
which
was
before
i
got
into
the
craft
beer
scene
i
have
finally
decided
to
give
it
another
chance
pours
a
reddish
orange
color
with
a
solid
white
head
that
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
very
faint
with
some
roasted
malts
and
caramel
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
in
that
has
faint
toasted
malt
and
slight
caramel
flavors
there
is
also
an
almost
medicinal
aftertaste
in
killians
that
has
always
turned
me
off
to
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bland
and
watered
down
attempt
at
a
quality
beer
by
coors
although
i
like
this
beer
a
little
better
than
most
mass
produced
beers
it
is
still
too
bland
and
unnecessarily
bitter
for
having
no
hop
character
it
is
what
it
is
an
alternative
made
by
coors
to
drinking
coors
best
for
drinking
in
mass
quantities
to
achieve
inebriation
d
easy
to
drink
and
not
very
filling
but
a
little
lacking
in
flavor
compared
to
most
micro
brews
however
i
find
it
a
good
alternative
if
youre
faced
only
with
choices
from
the
brewing
giants
this
used
to
be
my
favorite
beer
before
i
started
drinking
micros
so
it
still
has
a
somewhat
warm
place
in
my
heart
and
palate
wow
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
killians
in
probably
4
years
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
macrofiltered
copper
color
slight
pale

no
real
aroma
a
bit
malty
and
a
touch
sweet
taste
actually
starts
off
with
a
pleasant
maerzenish
malt
flavor
then
gets
buzzy
from
carbonation
and
syrupy
sweet
after
several
sips
a
bland
metallic
aftertaste
sets
in
hrm
no
thanks
pours
with
off
white
head
nice
light
copperyreddish
color
slight
sweet
malty
carmely
smell
slight
sweet
malty
taste
nice
hop
and
malt
balance
not
a
real
flavorful
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
not
flavorful
enough
for
me
my
friends
that
like
the
average
beers
really
like
this
beer
used
to
drink
it
years
ago
overall
i
have
to
say
that
my
tastes
have
come
a
long
way
this
was
my
goto
beer
when
i
was
in
my
teens
now
i
must
say
im
not
too
fond
of
it
i
see
that
the
exp
date
is
in
about
a
month
i
may
try
a
fresher
sample
in
the
future
as
ive
had
this
beer
even
recently
and
remember
it
tasting
better
for
being
made
in
america
its
a
decent
irish
red
killians
irish
red
is
a
pretty
good
product
from
the
coors
brewing
company
and
it
exceeds
the
taste
expectations
for
a
beer
from
this
macro
brewery
it
cant
compare
to
some
of
the
great
red
brews
from
around
the
usa
and
the
world
but
it
is
still
fairly
tasty
for
a
large
scale
production
brew
it
isnt
as
complex
as
it
could
be
but
i
still
like
it
nonetheless
not
demanding
on
the
taste
buds
almost
kind
of
sweet
its
a
nice
copper
color
mouthfeel
isnt
impressive
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
wouldnt
brag
about
it
or
enjoy
myself
nearly
as
much
as
my
friends
do

but
nothing
to
back
it
up
all
flavors
quickly
fade
away
leaving
a
trace
of

flavor
in
the
mouth
a
beer
that
makes
macro

think
they
are

something
special

unappealing

reddish
amber
color
with

inch

the
color
of
dirty
wash
water
aroma
was
surprisingly
rich
for
an
industrial
lager
could
actually
detect
toasty
caramel
hints
while
this
beer
was
much
smoother
than
a
bud
it
had
the
typical
bite
of
6row
lager
malts
the
body
was
fuller
and
i
could
detect
a
sweet
carmal
like
background
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
as
lingering
sweetness
its
an
alright
beer
no
major
complaints
but
it
doesnt
really
have
a
lot
going
for
it
either
usually
fairly
inexpensive
so
its
ok
to
get
once
in
a
while
drinkability
all
flavors
are
very
subtle
which
is
nice
if
you
dont
want
something
overpowering
a
few
bready
and
apple
flavors
make
it
unique
completely
enjoyable
no
complaints

drinkablity
it
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
3
or
4
in
a
night
deep
red
with
more
of
a
head
than
i
would
expect
at
a
racetrak
there
is
little
complexity
to
this
beer
and
whats
there
is
at
the
surface
i
do
dig
the
smokiness
of
the
malt
and
it
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
sitting
outside
in
the
summer
decided
to
pick
up
another
random
beer
looks
like
i
did
pretty
good
one
of
the
best
macros
ive
tried
sofar
boured
an
nice
copper
amber
almost
orange
with
about
341
inch
cream
colored
head
that
dissappeared
quickly
taste
was
very
smooth
with
little
to
no
dryness
slight
caramel
a
little
weaterd
down
for
my
taste
but
far
more
more
flavor
than
most
amarican
macro
lagers
a
little
more
carbonation
would
have
helped
the
mouth
feel
easily
drikable
and
enjoyable
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
was
the
smell
of
this
beer
which
in
my
glass
was
that
of
puke
no
kidding
drinks
okay
good
beer
to
have
when
youre
miles
away
from
beer
civilization
at
its
best
fresh
its
better
than
this
review
at
its
worst
just
mundane
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
there
wasnt
much
smell
considering
the
big
head
on
this
beer
i
did
get
it
on
tap
but
even
after
the
head
faded
there
wasnt
much
going
on
smell
was
mixed
with
hops
and
malts
a
standard
macro
the
taste
is
a
bit
different
hard
to
pinpoint
but
a
good
mix
and
balance
good
for
a
macro
more
flavor
than
your
average
has
a
small
bite
to
it
this
is
worth
trying
especially
if
you
are
looking
towards
average
prices
for
a
better
macro
than
the
rest
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
if
you
are
confined
to
buying
from
a
grocery
store
with
macro

killians
is
a
good
choice
poured
into
a
mug
with
a
moderate
amber
body
and
a
fluffy
off
white
head
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
except
for
a
little
grain
and
toasty
malt
again
this
tastes
grainy
a
lot
like
a
macro
lager
what
bolsters
the
rating
on
the
flavor
is
the
presence
of
the
toastiness
almost
has
a
cocoa
flavor
to
it
mouthfeel
was
too
light
and
prickly
for
me
aside
from
the
bad
points
this
was
rather
drinkable
with
my
pizza
eric
overall
i
couldnt
really
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
it
is
pretty
good
actually
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
have
again
when
im
at
a
restaurant
with
limited
options
but
like
i
said
its
like
a
slightly
higher
quality
macrobrew
drinkable
if
theres
nothing
else
but
bud
but
id
certainly
rather
have
something
more
interesting
note
i
just
had
this
beer
again
today
for
lunch
and
i
could
now
see
the
appearance
as
i
probably
couldve
guessed
it
was
red
really
red
looked
good
so
i
recommend
that
if
you
are
strapped
for
some
cash
and
you
want
to
enjoy
a
beer
go
ahead
and
enjoy
a
irish
red
beer
not
to
mention
its
perfect
for
st
patricks
day
oh
yeah
slante
my
fellow
bas
d
below
average
drinkability
not
enough
flavor
a
little
left
over
sweetness
and
that
is
about
it
for
the
same
price
i
am
all
over
jw
dundees
american
amber
drinkability
easy
to
slam
if
you
wanted
to
with
just
enough
flavor
to
sit
and
enjoy
in
a
pinch
this
is
one
of
those
round
to
it
reviews
i
have
had
killians
irish
red
many
times
never
thought
that
much
about
savoring
it
and
writing
a
review
pours
a
nice
copperyreddish
color
with
little
head
and
lacing
didnt
notice
any
distinctive
aroma
mild
malt
taste
thin
mouthfeel
a
step
up
from
bmc
but
not
all
that
much
flavor
i
would
do
pitchers
of
this
at
hooters
especially
if
the
other
choices
were
bud
lite
or
coors
lite
i
much
prefer
yeungling
or
sam
adams
for
mass
consumption
and
snpa
if
i
just
want
to
kick
back
and
savor
something
good
overall
though
killians
isnt
worth
the
price
it
fetches
at
least
around
here
its
a
good
substitute
for
macro
lagers
and
it
would
be
a
fine
backup
beer
if
it
were
cheap
but
anyplace
with
a
decent
selection
should
have
better
offerings
in
this
price
range
went
okay
with
my
mushroomswiss
veggieburger
but
not
something
ill
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
cheers2beers
lightest
dark
lager
ive
seen
and
not
all
that
red
really
no
outstandingm
striking
favor
just
tastes
like
any
old
lager
hoppy
sharp
bitter
aftertaste
that
stays
with
you
i
liked
this
better
when
i
was
younger
and
it
is
a
good
starter
beer
to
jump
from
your
buds
and
millers
to
but
its
nothing
id
intentionally
drink
if
i
had
my
choice
this
was
served
ice
cold
with
absoultely
no
head
and
dark
brown
color
mildly
malty
aroma
with
a
toasty
malt
accented
flavor
aftertaste
was
carbonation
and
some
hops
thrown
in
i
was
thirsty
at
the
time
so
this
went
down
pretty
good
especially
with
some
spicy
food
overall
not
too
bad
for
a
macro
but
this
is
nothing
to
look
forward
to
after
a
hard
day
this
beer
is
classified
on
ba
as
a
euro
dark
lager
not
a
style
im
familiar
with
and
there
are
presently
no
guidelines
provided
so
this
beer
was
not
very
dark
and
not
very
lager
either
but
for
a
macro
product
its
one
of
the
best
i
guess
ill
rate
it
partly
as
a
macro
offering
unfortunately
the
taste
can
get
old
it
is
not
something
you
can
chug
or
party
with
well
without
your
stomach
filling
up
with
air
this
beer
will
fill
you
up
like
you
just
ate
dinner
then
again
killians
with
dinner
at
a
regular
chain
restaurant
is
certainly
not
bad
d
id
drink
this
again
a
fine
beer
not
in
my
top
5
by
any
means
but
not
a
bad
beer
by
the
way
pour
it
into
a
glass
if
you
drink
it
out
of
the
bottle
it
is
sour
and
adjunct
its
kind
of
sweet
with
a
slight
hint
of
malt
the
reddishcopper
color
is
appealing
and
the
head
stayed
the
duration
not
much
going
on
in
the
aroma
department
maybe
if
it
was
served
in
a
chalice
mouthfeel
is
ok
consistent
with
most
lagers
that
i
have
had
just
enough
carbonation
however
i
get
left
with
an
aftertaste
that
i
can
do
without
espescially
after
about
three
or
four
i
also
have
to
drink
this
extra
cold
anything
above
35
degrees
and
that
aftertaste
i
mentioned
starts
to
be
the
domiant
taste
it
lets
you
know
that
this
is
no
euro
lager
to
me
its
the
best
that
coors
has
to
offer
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
beer
is
a
rather
nice
beer
to
drink
you
can
find
it
anywhere
and
its
better
than
yer
average
beer
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
but
just
a
hint
normal
medium
lager
overall
smells
like
it
tastes
and
it
has
a
good
feel
for
your
entire
tongue
had
an
average
head
the
appearance
was
ambercopper
with
a
normal
head
the
smell
was
about
average
of
a
medium
lager
and
smelled
of
the
malted
grain
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
sweet
and
not
too
hoppy
other
than
that
this
beer
was
average
except
having
the
advantage
of
having
more
body
to
its
taste
than
your
average
macro
lager
mouthfeel
was
again
better
than
an
average
lager
but
mainly
due
to
its
heavier
content
i
felt
the
drinkability
was
good
and
i
do
enjoy
these
as
an
alternative
other
beers
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
with
a
bit
more
taste
was
hoping
this
one
would
stand
out
a
little
but
alas
like
most
macros
it
just
sits
there
if
they
dont
have
anything
extra
special
on
tap
or
bottle
this
would
beat
some
of
the
others
flavor
is
better
than
say
your
average
pilsner
but
they
could
do
better
coors
did
a
little
better
with
the
blue
moon
series
of
beers
when
i
was
in
high
school
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
that
i
tried
that
was
an
alternative
to
common
bmc
products
at
the
time
i
thought
this
was
the
real
deal
but
it
simply
doesnt
leave
the
same
impression
with
me
these
days
an
average
irish
style
lager
by
all
accounts
and
a
good
choice
when
options
are
limited
it
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
but
nothing
overtly
special
about
it
very
average
as
my
score
reflects
nothing
offended
nothing
complemented
drinkability
is
decent
might
make
a
good
session
brew
not
bad
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
without
lacing
but
leaves
a
little
film
the
beer
smells
of
caramel
and
roasted
barley
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
up
front
with
some
other
malts
in
it
it
is
rather
weak
overall
though
it
could
be
thicker
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
watery
overall
a
drinkable
beer
especially
when
nothing
else
is
available
d
very
smooth
not
hard
to
drink
through
i
wouldnt
really
search
it
out
dont
get
me
wrongthough
i
would
absolutley
take
this
over
a
macro
wonder
is
george
killian
would
recognize
his
brew
i
could
drink
several
of
these
they
are
light
both
in
flavor
and
alcohol
just
not
sure
i
would
want
to
given
a
choice
between
this
and
conventional
macros
i
would
probably
pick
this
body
is
between
light
and
medium
with
coarse
feeling
carbonation
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
with
little
texture
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
really
not
offensive
in
any
way
drinkability
pretty
good
i
could
drink
these
fine
not
as
great
as
i
used
to
believe
it
i
still
hold
it
higher
for
something
from
a
macrobrewery
poured
a
perfectly
clear
deep
reddish
color
with
moderate
head
that
quickly
falls
to
a
thin
ring
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
sweeting
with
some
roasted
malt
present
taste
presents
itself
with
a
light
caramel
note
taste
rapidly
disappears
leaving
little
behind
an
ok
beer
with
easy
drinkability
dnot
badbetter
than
average
can
easily
drink
a
lot
of
this
nothing
offensive
here
i
drank
this
a
lot
in
college
along
with
miller
lite
which
i
just
reviewed
and
wanted
to
review
it
because
of
that
not
anything
offensive
but
my
taste
in
beer
has
changed
quite
a
bit
since
college
the
taste
brings
back
good
memories
cheers
when
poured
into
a
glass
it
is
a
orangeish
red
with
a
noticeable
foamy
head
the
scent
is
of
malt
and
malt
lol
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
smooth
lager
that
goes
down
rather
nice
and
easy
the
mouthfeel
is
verry
light
overall
for
the
price
this
is
a
beer
i
can
enjoy
again
and
again
and
not
feel
cheated
or
guilty
for
drinking
it
by
far
this
is
miles
ahead
of
all
of
the
other
macrobeers
i
really
do
love
this
beer
the
taste
is
unique
and
crisp
and
if
the
aroma
were
more
pleasant
detectable
i
wouldnt
need
to
drink
anything
else
its
cheap
with
plenty
of
great
qualities
to
make
it
an
overall
great
beer
this
beer
came
a
crystal
clear
and
glowing
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
wisp
of
head
that
formed
a
tiny
ring
around
the
rim
of
my
glass
smelled
faintly
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
aroma
was
nice
but
it
was
really
hard
to
find
the
quality
is
fine
but
it
loses
a
few
points
for
lacking
in
quantity
the
taste
is
really
nice
with
an
awesome
overroasted
caramel
malt
that
sends
smoky
caramel
up
into
my
nose
on
the
swallow
the
malt
also
contains
elements
of
oak
and
mushrooms
this
sweet
malt
is
balanced
with
a
light
citrus
sour
and
an
understated
hop
dryness
this
is
a
great
blend
of
flavors
the
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
prominent
but
unobtrusive
carbonation
i
found
this
to
be
a
great
brew
considering
that
its
mass
produced
and
so
widely
available
theres
nothing
really
amazing
going
on
here
but
theres
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
it
nice
beer
taste
was
not
much
different
than
a
coors
yet
a
bit
better
more
malt
less
corn
and
straw
a
good
feel
and
drinkability
can
have
it
for
st
pattys
day
if
im
broke
perhaps
coors
second
best
beer
winterfest
pours
a
dark
amber
color
some
carbonation
small
head
and
some
lacing
throughout
the
scent
is
sweet
malty
the
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
not
bad
aftertaste
medium
body
drinkable
i
remember
having
this
brew
way
back
when
i
lived
in
ca
first
red
beer
i
ever
had
had
this
on
tap
today
nice
amber
color
but
thats
probably
the
best
thing
you
can
say
about
this
beer
the
taste
is
inoffensive
but
not
really
interesting
either
perhaps
a
step
above
budmillercoors
but
not
much
if
i
were
looking
for
a
macro
and
this
was
on
sale
i
might
buy
it
but
not
worth
seeking
out
not
drinkable
at
all
not
enjoyable
not
even
alcoholic
enough
to
choke
down
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
flavor
is
not
what
i
remembered
maybe
ive
just
experienced
so
many
full
flavored
beers
since
the
last
time
i
had
this
one
but
i
just
remembered
this
being
at
least
moderatly
drinkable
dont
get
me
wrong
for
an
american
macro
its
one
of
the
best
thats
widely
available
ill
take
it
over
bud
or
standard
coors
any
day
if
im
out
and
i
want
a
beer
and
this
is
the
best
they
have
i
wont
complain
i
guess
that
sums
up
the
review
start
with
blue
moon
this
was
the
beer
that
paved
the
way
for
my
love
of
darker
beer
i
rarely
drink
it
anymore
but
felt
a
certain
nostalgia
and
decided
to
review
when
i
do
drink
it
its
usually
on
special
or
the
beer
list
reads
bud
bud
lite
miller
miller
lite
and
killians
bingo
killians
in
my
earlier
days
i
remember
this
beer
having
a
bold
flavor
compared
to
what
i
was
mostly
drinking
college
party
beers
the
color
of
this
beer
is
always
consistent
a
clear
amberred
with
a
light
to
very
little
head
and
very
little
lacing
it
has
a
good
malty
smell
that
is
a
bit
deep
but
clean
i
swear
that
i
can
detect
some
corn
adjuncts
in
the
smell
however
the
taste
is
still
not
bad
its
a
sweettobitter
carmalized
maltly
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thin
however
its
a
standard
red
lager
not
near
as
good
as
a
yuengling
but
its
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
funny
note
is
i
once
saw
this
beer
on
an
import
list
in
a
us
restaurant
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
kind
of
falling
the
more
different
beers
i
try
the
more
i
think
this
one
is
kind
of
boring
it
could
have
more
taste
but
its
still
better
than
anything
ive
had
in
the
american
macro
style
the
appearance
is
always
nice
a
clear
red
thats
slightly
gold
head
is
minimal
to
nonexistent
smell
is
pleasant
too
mostly
of
carmalized
malt
taste
is
pretty
good
sweet
malts
up
front
but
the
hops
are
very
bland
thats
not
all
bad
at
least
the
hops
arent
nasty
but
even
i
think
they
need
a
stronger
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
ok
not
too
thick
or
too
thin
but
carbonation
could
be
a
little
weaker
drinkability
is
good
killians
always
goes
down
easy
its
not
great
because
the
taste
isnt
so
good
that
i
still
really
want
more
after
ive
had
2
not
that
drinking
another
one
would
be
an
effort
either
anyway
for
your
use
instead
of
mine
the
good
things
that
can
be
said
for
killians
are
that
it
can
be
had
anywhere
its
never
objectionable
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
malts
are
pretty
good
the
down
side
is
that
its
expensive
and
there
are
more
flavorful
beers
out
there
for
less
for
me
its
best
attribute
now
is
that
its
available
so
widely
you
know
what
youre
in
for
when
you
see
the
peals
of
bubbles
rapidly
ascending
throughout
the
glass
this
beer
is
a
little
over
carbonated
it
was
the
first
thing
i
noticed
when
it
hit
my
tongue
a
little
zing
that
distracted
from
what
i
thought
was
otherwise
a
slightly
sweet
taste
with
just
a
back
ed
of
bitterness
that
made
for
a
tasty
swallow
overall
its
not
a
superstrong
taste
but
definitely
a
step
up
from
its
macrocousins
pours
an
inviting
deep
dark
red
appearance
is
certainly
the
high
point
of
this
lager
smells
grainy
with
a
subtle
sweetness
to
it
fairly
stronger
tasting
than
expected
given
the
aroma
overly
carbonated
as
are
the
vast
majority
of
massmarket
beers
of
this
variety
overall
not
a
bad
session
beer
as
far
as
mainstream
beers
go
nice
reddish
color
with
a
good
carbonation
level
good
somewhat
sweet
aromaalmost
a
moderate
spiciness
to
it
rather
average
malty
flavor
somewhat
harsh
and
medicinal
ok
mouthfeelagain
pretty
average
a
rather
ho
hum
beer
i
usually
consider
this
the
only
coors
product
i
like
but
i
think
id
rather
have
a
coors
extra
gold
if
they
still
make
it
might
be
a
good
training
wheel
beer
for
the
novice
this
is
a
bit
unenlightening
i
wish
i
could
report
that
this
was
delicious
and
reminded
my
of
my
youth
in
a
positive
way
but
it
actually
reinforced
the
opinion
that
i
was
an
uneducated
drunken
slob
who
drank
swill
that
was
slickly
marketed
and
packaged
this
is
all
slightly
depressing
but
i
still
have
a
soft
spot
for
killians
regardless
a
clear
bubbly
amber
has
a
small
head
of
foam
on
it
i
dont
get
much
out
of
the
aroma
it
smells
like
beer
but
thats
about
all
i
can
say
the
taste
is
very
lacking
i
dont
detect
any
strong
malt
flavors
only
a
hint
of
hops
i
think
there
is
some
flavor
down
deep
in
there
trying
to
come
out
but
its
just
not
getting
to
me
it
tastes
crisp
and
dry
though
but
empty
its
thin
and
watery
but
with
decent
carbonation
overall
just
not
enough
flavor
it
looks
good
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
pours
a
nice
deep
red
with
a
small
head
and
some
carbonation
pretty
stong
taste
for
a
massmarketed
beer
with
some
smoky
flavor
carbonation
evident
in
the
mouth
goes
down
smooth
not
much
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
found
this
left
in
my
fridge
bottle
dated
feb
26
not
sure
if
that
is
the
bottling
or
freshness
date
poured
into
my
pint
glass
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
vanilla
colored
2
finger
head
the
head
dissapears
at
a
medium
pace
and
leaves
a
thin
film
until
its
gone
it
smells
of
malt
and
grain
also
the
same
taste
malt
and
grain
a
little
sweet
mouthfeel
is
ok
easy
to
drink
its
a
pretty
good
beer
tastes
a
little
nutty
and
very
little
hops
dominated
mainly
by
the
sweet
malt
i
think
that
when
ive
had
this
on
tap
that
it
had
more
hop
flavor
this
but
ill
have
to
check
that
out
next
time
im
stuck
in
a
dive
bar
not
bad
very
drinkable
as
it
should
be
and
reasonably
smooth
this
is
basically
on
every
tap
in
any
restaurant
that
serves
anything
besides
bud
miller
it
always
seems
to
have
a
musky
smell
taste
i
remember
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
long
ago
hoping
that
it
would
be
better
than
the
rest
of
the
stuff
that
particular
restaurant
had
on
tap
it
does
have
an
aftertaste
that
lingers
and
doesnt
impress
me
the
appearance
is
red
as
it
mentions
w
a
slight
head
the
appearance
is
probably
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
and
its
still
basically
average
as
long
as
this
beer
is
cold
i
could
drink
it
all
day
a
head
above
those
other
macro
lagers
but
thats
not
saying
much
theres
a
little
bit
of
malt
floating
around
in
here
but
otherwise
fairly
light
and
watery
dark
burnt
orange
little
head
and
nothing
for
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
weak
weak
malts
and
a
clean
grainy
sweetness
relatively
smooth
finish
and
decent
drinkability
has
to
be
one
of
those
oh
shit
theres
nothing
better
ontap
beers
for
me
overall
if
i
have
to
pick
between
this
and
macro
swill
i
choose
this
otherwise
its
nothing
special
the
first
time
i
ever
had
a
killians
i
was
in
italy
and
didnt
realize
there
was
a
difference
between
the
american
and
european
versions
until
i
returned
to
the
states
obviously
the
european
one
george
killians
i
believe
is
far
superior
on
the
whole
there
are
many
better
malty
reds
out
there
but
20
years
after
my
first
killians
i
got
to
say
that
i
still
like
it
low
fermentation
beer
soft
amber
color
similar
to
dos
equis
amber
high
in
malt
content
taste
bitter
harmonious
well
ballanced
fragant
and
fruity
smell
like
a
roses
try
with
german
cuisine
and
cheese
serve
in
a
pilsner
glass
or
direct
from
the
bottle
good
lacing
85
recommended
poured
a
clear
amber
hue
a
creamy
offwhite
head
of
one
and
a
half
fingers
will
hold
nicely
before
droping
to
modest
lacing
decent
crystal
malt
aroma
but
weak
the
toasted
caramel
flavor
is
thin
but
appealing
faint
english
hops
in
the
aftertaste
but
enough
to
balance
the
lightish
malt
flavor
light
body
and
active
carbonation
start
off
crisp
and
turn
slick
near
the
finish
very
drinkable
but
very
dull
notes
having
this
on
tap
is
so
much
better
than
having
it
out
of
the
bottle
very
easy
to
drink
this
much
like
a
light
cider
in
terms
of
drinkability
a
bit
sweet
to
have
too
many
of
but
a
decent
cheap
beer
this
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
lacing
the
smell
is
simple
and
clean
but
has
a
caramelly
sweetness
the
taste
is
nothign
complex
fairly
sweet
and
malty
could
use
more
hop
flavor
this
is
allright
but
could
use
a
little
life
to
it
high
falls
amber
is
cheaper
and
better
very
drinkable
maybe
too
sweetsugary
to
have
an
abundant
amount
but
enjoying
a
few
of
these
is
no
problem
for
a
macro
this
aint
too
bad
i
had
this
ontap
at
an
allman
brothers
consert
last
night
it
poured
out
with
a
nice
average
sized
head
it
had
a
wonderfull
appearance
as
well
a
nice
deep
crimson
color
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
above
average
considering
it
is
a
macro
if
i
am
presented
with
the
choices
i
had
to
choose
from
last
night
in
the
future
i
will
choose
killians
again
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
choice
a
killians
every
now
and
then
is
a
good
thing
drinkability
is
pretty
poor
as
is
the
rest
of
this
beer
not
much
more
than
a
typical
american
adjunct
macro
lager
with
some
food
coloring
not
this
one
average
this
used
to
be
my
go
to
beer
now
i
cant
stand
it
it
tastes
like
a
dark
beer
that
didnt
finish
school
it
has
a
nice
copper
color
but
i
feel
like
im
going
to
get
sick
when
i
drink
it
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
a
real
bad
flavor
slides
down
my
throat
when
i
take
a
sip
its
good
for
beginners
but
otherwise
dont
touch
it
a
decent
attempt
by
coors
to
brew
a
little
bit
outside
the
box
man
i
remember
in
college
when
i
thought
this
one
was
the
best
hands
down
it
was
before
i
got
into
craft
brews
though
before
i
noticed
there
was
a
whole
world
of
beers
better
than
this
average
red
actually
a
bit
disappointing
compared
to
so
many
others
in
this
style
could
be
a
session
beer
if
nothing
else
was
offered
or
on
a
great
special
but
never
a
top
choice
so
my
choices
were
fosters
bud
budlight
or
killians
normally
id
opt
for
a
water
but
i
hadnt
had
a
killians
in
about
5
years
and
figured
id
give
it
a
whirl
for
the
heck
of
it
pours
a
mediumred
with
a
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
cooked
grains
readily
apparent
in
the
aroma
taste
well
its
basically
coors
original
with
red
food
coloring
really
no
complexity
to
speak
of
somewhat
bitter
but
not
from
hops
very
bland
tastes
like
it
was
probably
made
with
a
strain
of
coors
lager
yeast
unremarkable
i
wouldnt
waste
your
time
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
this
is
brewed
according
to
the
same
recipe
as
the
euro
counterpart
though
ive
never
had
that
i
also
find
it
sad
that
many
people
think
this
is
an
import
and
some
places
bad
places
even
list
it
as
being
from
ireland
coors
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
correct
that
notion
either
drinkability
a
nice
beer
thats
better
than
alot
of
macros
that
ive
tried
if
you
get
cheap
it
will
make
an
ok
session
beer
oh
i
notice
as
im
about
to
enter
the
review
its
classed
as
a
euro
dark
lager
cripe
thats
not
fair
a
fall
back
beer
at
best
and
even
then
id
go
for
guinness
first
just
not
my
style
i
guess
but
atleast
it
goes
down
pretty
good
i
have
really
come
to
enjoy
this
beer
even
more
so
as
time
goes
on
it
has
a
deeper
color
and
flavor
compared
with
other
macros
yet
its
still
drinkable
the
price
isnt
bad
either
with
this
beer
you
get
a
mild
yet
decent
tasting
version
of
the
european
varieties
but
without
that
damned
skunkiness
you
often
get
with
those
brews
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
flavor
yet
its
not
overpowering
i
can
drink
one
and
be
happy
or
i
can
drink
many
more
without
any
ill
effects
to
me
it
seems
that
coors
actually
put
some
effort
into
making
this
beer
stand
out
from
other
mass
produced
beers
1

nothing

but
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
could
drink
a
couple
cases
of
tasted
only
slightly
above
average
very
medium
bodied
it
was
smooth
and
tasted
of
toasted
malts
grain
and
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
in
the
range
of
a
sugar
cane
type
taste
overall
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
a
memorable
beer
my
taste
buds
deserve
better
drinkability
i
remember
loving
this
stuff
when
i
first
discovered
beer
and
then
hating
it
once
i
started
getting
into
good
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
had
it
recently
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
nothing
i
would
ever
seek
out
though
since
there
are
far
better
ones
out
there
with
comparable

chilled
in
a

glass
pours
a
kinda
amberburnt
sienna
color
with
a
good
amount
of
streams
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
reduces
to
nothing
however
the
head
reforms
and
leaves
nice
lacing
toward
the
end
sugary
sweet

nuts

caramel
and
toasted

with
some
floral
hops
and
a
subtle
bitterness
and
maybe
some
adjunct
flavors
in
the
back
with
a
tingly
medium
to
light
body
this
is
better
than
i
remember
it
being
but
still
nothing
great
a
good
fallback
if
theres
nothing
else
the
beer
looks
nicely
auburn
and
crimson
with
medium
carbonation
to
liven
it
up
subtle
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
a
little
toasty
caramelly
and
biscuity
tastes
equals
the
aromas
but
offers
little
in
the
way
of
boldness
or
strength
no
real
body
or
hop
character
weak
body
and
watery
mouthfeel
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
always
expect
more
from
this
one
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
and
just
a
whisp
staying
around
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
aroma
is
very
faint
just
a
hint
of
malts
the
taste
was
crisp
and
blandly
malty
with
a
offsetting
metallic
aftertaste
the
beer
was
a
little
thin
and
overcarbonated
i
used
to
drink
this
in
college
boy
do
i
wish
i
knew
what
i
know
now
back
then
although
not
exotic
by
any
means
ill
take
this
over
any
other
macro
brew
i
can
think
of
just
a
really
pleasant
drinking
beer
pours
clear
copperred
to
me
it
has
an
earthy
smell
moderate
toasted
malt
and
carmael
flavor
light
pleasent
aftertaste
a
good
change
of
pace
carbonation
for
the
bottle
i
drank
was
soft
overall
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
good
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
i
will
buy
this
one
again
sometime
nice
red
color
as
the
name
proclaims
head
is
nice
and
sticky
and
stays
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
toasted
grains
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
is
clean
and
is
dominated
by
toasted
grains
a
touch
of
caramel
and
a
dry
grain
finish
has
a
meduim
carbonated
body
nothing
special
here
just
an
average
dark
lager
oh
yeah
to
all
my
friends
who
think
they
are
drinking
the
real
deal
coors
brews
this
beer
in
conclusion
i
find
that
for
a
macrobrew
this
one
isnt
bad
at
all
this
beer
definitely
isnt
anything
revolutionary
but
when
its
on
a
list
next
to
the
likes
of
bud
and
miller
lite
definitely
go
for
the
killians
drinkability
yep
average
id
never
have
this
in
a
bar
unless
it
was
on
special
yeah
thats
where
ive
had
this
one
before
1
50
22oz
special
at
bw3
years
ago
better
than
anything
in
the
coors
house
other
than
blue
moon
killians
starts
off
as
a
fairly
inoffensive
beernothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
bad
either
i
suspect
that
perhaps
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
been
dumbeddown
as
it
were
though
not
fruity
you
can
drink
more
than
one
overall
ice
house
but
not
really
strong
amberred
with
a
respectable
head
aroma
is
somewhat
malty
and
to
my
suprise
there
is
some
hop
presence
on
the
toungue
it
isnt
bad
hmmm
but
again
nothing
special
would
i
drink
it
again
if
its
already
in
the
fridge
i
would
but
if
i
have
something
better
in

still
not
my

have
to

the

the
small
bubbles
in

carbonation

i
developed

deep

its

for
what

a
nice
looking
really
nice

super
crisp
from

some

had
it
at

i
was

better
than
capital

amber
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
large
foam
head
that
dissipates
quickly
no

aroma
is
lightly
toasted
grain
malts
with
a
slight

of

and

the
lightly
toasted
grains
come
through
really
nicely
along
with
some
pleasant
honey
and
bready
malts
really
easy
to
drink
perfectly
carbonated
and
very
refreshing
honestly
surprised
to
see
as
low
of
a
rating
on
this
one
its
not
the
best
but
its
a
super
easy
drinker
and
tasted
pretty
good
to
boot
easily
sessionable
surprisingly
flavorful
had
this
on
the
square
at
taste
of
madison
overall
great
offering
here
from
wisconsin
brewing
co
the
mouthfeel
isnt
much
like
a
lager
but
the
taste
comes
through
for
the
style
a
touch
sweet
but
i
really
enjoy
it
in
this
brew
a
very
nice
wellbalanced
american
amber
lager
nice
hop
touch
in
the
finish
the
wi
brewing
web
site
calls
this
a
classic
bavarian
lager
well
i
never
had
anything
like
this
on
my
visits
to
bavaria
but
marketing
doesnt
make
it
any
less
enjoyable
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
around
to
this
but
if
youre
having
a
brat
fry
this
is
the
beer
you
wanna
have
on
hand
great
for
everyone
from
cicerones
to
budmillercoors
crowds
all
in
all
very
good
in
my
books
way
to
go
wisconsin
overall
not
bad
i
think
its
a
good
beer
to
have
in
the
house
in
case
i
have
people
who
arent
into
the
high
end
beers
like
i
am
and
just
need
something
easy
drinking
oa
strong
offering
and
one
that
could
draw
followers
id
definitely
choose
this
one
over
wisconsin
amber
but
would
still
choose
my
favorite
lakefront
riverwest
stein
over
the
wbc
offering
if
sold
at
the
same
pointofpurchase
basically
an
average
at
best
beer
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
and
the
funky
aftertaste
doesnt
help
matters
there
are
better
beers
out
there
this
is
essentially
an
amber

taste
pretty

very
strong
beers
filler
beer
is
how
its
known
at
my
house
i
do

i
would
recommend
it
though
if
you
just
came
in
from
the
snow
but
youre
now
sitting
by
a
warm
fire
i
can
see
this
working
in
the
winter
like
that
o
while
this
wasnt
what
i
expected
with
a
name
like
winter
skal
i
enjoyed
it
overall
and
would
recomend
it
to
any
bmc
drinker
that
wants
something
more
complex
without
going
to
far
away
from
the
comfort
zone
a
very
excellent
balance
of
hop
and
malt
enough
hops
to
keep
you
satisfied
and
a
strong
enough
malt
to
really
impress
you
one
of
my
favorites
from
capital
skal
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
size
head
there
is
a
strong
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
floral
notes
the
taste
has
a
nice
malty
backbone
like
most
red
lagers
but
has
a
strong
hoppy
flavor
good
full
flavor
enjoy
the
hop
flavors
finishes
bitter
overall
i
found
this
a
very
good
and
interesting
amber
the
bitterness
really
makes
this
beer
enjoyable
do
wisconsins
capital
brewery
is
generally
pretty
good
at
letting
the
quality
of
its
beers
establish
it
as
a
very
conservative
but
proficient
producer
this
beer
is
a
departure
with
discordant
qualities
and
a
wildlyoscillating
level
of
sweetness
that
is
never
able
to
become
comfortable
on
the
palate
it
is
a
seasonal
whose
useful
lifespan
has
elapsed
maybe
i
left
this
in
the
fridge
too
long
best
i
can
say
is
it
freed
up
some
space
in
the
fridge
overall
well
it
sure
is
different
so
i
will
grant
them
kudos
for
creativity
but
i
cannot
say
that
i
would
care
to
try
this
again
do
very
drinkable
although
just
one
step
above
a
macro
for
me
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
this
again
as
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
the
main
memorable
feature
i
am
left
with
is
that
here
is
a
spiced
winter
themed
brew
that
keeps
things
restrained
and
subtle
on
the
spicing
it
does
not
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
spicing
nor
like
spicy
chinese
takeout
as
other
heavily
herbedspiced
winter
warmers
often
do
so
if
you
prefer
your
spiced
beer
lighter
on
the
spice
factor
than
most
this
is
the
easydrinking
brew
for
you
o
this
beer
had
some
decent
flavors
but
it
could
have
benefited
from
a
little
more
caramel
malt
flavors
and
a
little
less
carbonation
overall
a
solid
beer
though
plus
they
sell
it
everywheremarianos
binnys
and
jewel
food
store
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
it
finishes
dry
not
much
to
like
about
this
beer
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
again
excellent
summer
beer
for
a
malt
lover
easy
drinking
and
pretty
tasty
refreshing
and
quite
crushable
for
a
beer
with
this
much
character
and
personality
i
dont
usually
reach
for
lagers
in
the
winter
but
this
is
pretty
tasty
overall
not
exactly
sure
why
this
is
a
winter
seasonal
but
i
am
sure
that
this
is
an
excellent
viennalike
lager
well
balanced
with
tasty
malts
but
a
nice
dry
hop
kick
capital
knows
how
to
make
lagers
with
the
best
of
them
freshlytapped
kegs
are
always

when
skimming

board

this
example
pours
a
clear

topped
by
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
biscuit
toffee
light
brown
sugar
and
a

pinches
of

the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the

along
with
more
brown
sugar
some
cinnamon
some
light
maple
syrup
and
a
twinge
of
ginger
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
winter
brew
nothing
amazing
but
a
nice
easygoing
brew
with
some
mild
spicing
had
a
pint
at
the
pig
fiddle
in
edina
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
an
american
amber
lager
with
holiday
spices
added
its
not
a
bad
mix
but
id
enjoy
the
beer
just
as
much
without
it
the
malt
gives
a
dry
crisp
bready
caramel
with
a
hint
of
toffee
the
lager
feels
a
little
off
and
lacks
the
fruity
esters
of
a
winter
warmer
though
i
guess
if
were
calling
it
an
amber
lager
it
does
alright
worth
a
try
o
another
highly
enjoyable
lager
from
capital
brewery
as
i
just
mentioned
in
my
review
of
capitals
oktoberfest
many
of
capitals
beers
taste
about
the
same
to
me
but
i
do
like
that
taste
so
i
generally
will
give
their
brews
favorable
reviews
some
characteristics
that
i
was
able
to
pick
out
though
about
this
offering
was
a
fair
amount
of
biscuitbready
maltiness
and
a
small
bit
of
holiday
spiciness
maybe
some
ginger
or
nutmeg
o
a
great
wintertime
beer
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
several
of
these
next
to
a
fire
on
a
sleepy
snowedin
weekend
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
these
outside
the
late
fallwinter
months
but
its
a
seasonal
brew
anyway
the
capital
city
brewery
winter
skal
is
a
decent
beer
the
appearance
was
a
rich
amber
with
very
thin
white
head
the
scent
has
spice
and
malt
which
was
decent
the
taste
had
gingernutmeg
which
provides
a
nice
wintery
delight
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
and
would
be
perfect
of
cold
nights
i
recommend
this
for
those
that
want
good
flavor
without
being
to
heavy
a
very
nice
amber
lager
in
general
i
could
definitely
see
myself
having
more
of
these
with
the
right
season
good
crisp
mouth
that
mellows
to
a
moderate
fullness
toasted
caramel
toast
light
juicy
hops
finish
is
bready
and
full
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
here
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
a
good
representation
im
continually
impressed
with
capital
keep
it
up
this
was
a
nice
medium
bodied
beer
with
goof
flavor
not
overpowering
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
its
worth
a
try
though
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bright
red
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
very
faint
hint
of
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
ton
of
caramel
the
faint
hop
character
that
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
is
not
present
in
the
taste
and
i
think
that
is
a
real
shame
as
it
might
have
helped
things
from
becoming
as
cloying
as
they
are
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
sticky
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
im
sure
a
lot
of
people
would
really
like
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
again
as
it
is
just
far
too
cloying
for
my
tastes
pours
a
light
bronze
color
and
is
quite
transparent
though
no
real
visible
carbonation
pretty
good
head
with
some
nice
lacing
as
it
goes
down
persistent
head
with
good
retention
nice
cap
as
it
eventually
falls
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
light
toasted
bread
plus
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
has
a
bit
of
grain
and
bread
and
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
back
end
finishes
pretty
dry
after
a
light
body
with
higher
levels
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
enough
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
does
a
decent
job
hitting
the
high
notes
that
id
consider
possibilities
here
overall
this
is
a
reasonable
beer
it
is
not
something
i
like
to
have
too
many
of
but
has
become
somewhat
of
a
ritual
in
the
early
winter
season
213
revisited
this
beer
and
lowered
all
my
previous
rankings
by
25
d
considering
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
amber
alesred
lagers
this
is
a
interesting
change
solid
and
worth
a
try
nothing
earthshattering
here
but
give
it
a
go
drinkability
this
beer
lacks
the
heft
of
others
appearing
this
time
of
year
but
is
by
no
means
a
low
quality
beer
i
dont
find
myself
choosing
this
one
often
but
theres
no
reason
someone
who
doesnt
feel
the
need
to
spend
an
hour
with
a
beer
during
the
winter
might
not
make
this
their
goto
beer
this
beer
is
about
as
basic
as
it
gets
with
little
flavor
like
a
watered
down
butterier
oktoberfest
beer
d
not
hard
to
drink
but
doesnt
have
me
running
back
to
the
fridge
could
have
one
or
two
more
though
i
was
underwhelmed
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
feel
i
could
pick
it
out
of
a
lineup
mine
was
overwhelmingly
dominated
by
a
honey
taste
though
a
solid
amber
style
taste
was
discernible
for
about
the
1st
second
of
every
sip
the
color
looked
like
a
fairly
light
orange
not
dark
enough
for
amber
and
nowhere
near
red
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
one
since
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
out
of
a
beehive
taste
not
as
good
as
the
smell
was
there
is
a
nice
malty
flavor
that
is
followed
by
a
bitterness
but
the
bitterness
doesnt
really
compliment
the
sweetness
for
some
reason
not
bad
but
could
be
better
tasty
brew
glad
i
have
several
bottles
as
the
football
sunday
progesses
a
real
session
type
frosty
that
would
work
well
in
the
summer
too
d
very
nice
amber
lager
goes
down
nicely
i
find
this
to
be
very
drinkable
would
be
one
i
would
like
to
have
on
tap
and
sit
and
drink
a
few
overall
i
was
told
this
was
a
great
seasonal
well
i
beg
to
differ
this
was
just
another
marzen
to
throw
on
the
pile
nothing
really
distinguishable
about
this
beer
at
all
a
hard
pour
leaves
me
an
amber
brew
with
a
billowing
cap
of
foam
which
eventually
settles
into
a
pillowlike
situation
that
left
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
caramel
sweetness
from
toasted
malt
nicely
balanced
by
spicy
notes
from
the
hops
clove
perhaps
sweet
and
grainy
on
the
palate
the
spice
from
the
hops
lingers
a
few
seconds
after
the
beer
has
been
swallowed
the
faintest
indication
of
a
metallic
character
also
lingers
it
is
not
strong
enough
to
be
offputting
but
certainly
exists
this
lightbodied
brew
is
good
to
achieve
greatness
it
would
need
added
complexity
and
an
element
of
uniqueness
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
nice
big
bite
of
carbonation
o
winter
skål
is
a
fairly
straightforward
malty
amber
lager
with
subtle
floral
hop
nuances
that
provide
good
balance
for
an
easy
drinking
and
smooth
winter
lager
drinkability
is
good
if
you
want
a
easy
drinking
holiday
lager
this
will
fit
the
bill
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
beer
is
a
rustycopper
color
with
a
pillowy
tan
head
the
nose
is
rather
weak
and
nondistinct
a
bit
of
stale
grain
is
all
that
is
discernable
the
taste
retains
some
caramel
and
biscuity
flavors
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
there
is
also
a
slight
citrus
sourness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
and
has
a
smooth
velvety
carbonation
overall
a
drinkable
beer
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
this
beer
when
it
was
actually
in
season
pretty
good
beer
i
must
say
i
hope
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
pours
a
perfectly
clear
amber
with
a
decent
crème
head
that
fell
fast
mild
fruity
malts
and
mild
hops
on
the
nose
flavor
is
slight
salty
with
a
touch
of
citric
bite
not
abrasive
by
any
means
smooth
and
not
trying
to
be
showy
feel
is
smooth
in
liquid
carbonation
bites
a
bit
easy
to
drink
im
going
to
peg
this
as
a
pale
ale
not
too
shabby
pours
out
a
pretty
nice
orangered
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
into
the
beer
light
caramel
malt
nose
not
much
too
it
taste
is
a
mix
of
spices
caramel
malt
and
slight
hoppy
bitterness
to
it
very
well
balanced
interesting
amber
lager
much
spicier
than
riverwest
stein
but
very
nice
warming
sweetness
in
the
finish
makes
this
a
wonderful
candidate
for
a
cold
night
pretty
heavy
carbonation
adds
to
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
makes
it
much
more
refreshing
notes
from
and
tasted
on
011106
ddecent
brew
nothing
too
exciting
as
far
as
flavor
and
complexity
but
its
still
a
tasty
and
easytodrink
brew
thanks
to
my
bro
for
this
one
beer
for
christmas
they
should
call
this
a
nice
session
beer
not
much
to
satisfy
your
winter
needs
this
light
bodied
well
carbonated
beer
is
a
wet
beer
no
dryness
or
bittering
hops
evident
just
the
mild
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
spice
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
by
this
not
bad
overall
but
nothing
to
blow
the
socks
off
worth
giving
a
shot
d
very
good
winter
seasonal
highly
recommended
poured
crystal
clear
light
amber
big
pillowy
tan
head
great
looking
beer
nice
fresh
smell
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
citrus
very
malty
taste
typical
of
the
style
very
light
carbonation
went
nicely
with
the
taste
also
noted
a
little
warming
as
it
went
down
but
no
real
noticeable
taste
of
alcohol
which
was
also
nice
mediumlight
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
again
d
a
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
bunch
of
these
and
not
regret
it
very
sessionable
pours
a
straight
up
clear
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
after
the
pour
that
diminishes
to
next
to
nothing
pretty
quick
little
to
no
bubbling
somewhat
sweet
toasted
caramel
and
crystal
malt
aroma
faintly
citrus
bitter
caramel
is
the
aroma
starts
with
a
bittersweet
malty
melba
toast
malt
then
some
well
placed
hop
citrus
hits
the
middle
allthe
way
through
to
the
finish
and
linger
of
this
beers
taste
a
little
spicey
in
the
hoppy
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
only
the
spicey
finish
and
linger
of
this
beers
flavor
and
palate
makes
me
think
of
winter
other
than
that
a
blind
taste
test
would
convince
my
tastebuds
that
this
was
a
west
coast
amber
ale
not
a
wisconsin
winter
seasnal
brew
very
sessionable
though
should
consider
producing
all
year
round
conclusion
nothings
necessarily
wrong
with
this
beer
its
a
decent
amber
lager
in
the
american
style
and
for
what
it
is
its
tasty
and
deft
a
cut
above
some
of
its
competitors
however
its
nothing
special
perhaps
a
good
beer
to
really
introduce
the
bmc
crowd
into
real
beer
d
easy
enough
to
knock
back
a
few
in
a
sitting
not
so
strong
so
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
idea
either
in
my
usual
hit
or
miss
experience
with
beer
from
capital
brewery
this
one
is
a
miss
while
a
crisp
beer
the
taste
really
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
as
in
there
wasnt
any
taste
of
course
the
benefit
of
that
is
no
lingering
bad
aftertaste
though
all
that
being
said
it
is
a
seasonal
beer
and
who
knows
maybe
its
just
a
bad
recipe
this
year
personally
im
waiting
for
redhooks
winterhook
as
that
consistently
delivers
year
in
and
year
out
very
nice
offering
from
capitol
well
worth
a
try
clean
and
crisp
with
just
enough
body
actually
a
really
nice
lager
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
for
an
evening
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
capital
brew
i
dont
think
id
pay
for
a
six
pack
but
i
would
partake
in
another
should
it
cross
my
path
down
the
road
drinkability
pretty
decent
beer
as
the
flavors
improved
as
it
warmed
slightly
drinkability
its
alright
beer
if
you
have
a
problem
with
that
why
dont
you
go
cry
into
your
pillow
pours
a
creamy
amber
red
almost
copper
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
a
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
orange
and
a
bit
of
hops
to
finish
mouthfeel
was
very
light
almost
watery
not
terrible
but
for
the
aroma
i
wanted
a
heavier
silk
feel
tasted
simple
but
not
in
a
bad
way
starts
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
finishes
with
a
crisp
hint
of
hops
overall
a
very
solid
offering
if
the
mouthfeel
lived
up
to
the
aromataste
it
would
be
better
but
still
a
good
seasonal
brew
only
had
a
single
but
several
would
be
nice
any
time
of
the
year
the
unique
orange
spice
element
is
reminiscent
of
jenlain
noel
another
winter
seasonal
d
the
finish
becomes
a
little
cloying
by
the
end
but
otherwise
ok
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
poured
a
copper
light
reddish
color
with
a
soda
pop
white
head
that
fizzed
away
in
a
matter
of
seconds
smell
is
faint
malt
aroma
slight
hop
aroma
taste
creamy
malt
flavors
with
just
a
hint
of
carmel
mouthfeel
is
light
body
but
a
little
over
carbonated
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
during
the
winter
season
other
reviewers
have
stated
that
this
isnt
a
big
complex
beer
and
i
would
agree
what
you
do
get
is
a
solid
lager
with
a
good
taste
that
is
satisfying
and
quaffable
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
is
light
bodied
dont
have
to
worry
about
drinking
several
of
these
in
an
evening
and
have
them
hurting
you
either
definitely
recommended
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
fairly
uninspiring
appearance
rusty
amber
smells
of
malt
and
caramel
and
tastes
the
same
never
a
big
fan
of
these
types
and
this
did
nothing
to
change
my
thinking
actually
managed
to
get
worse
with
each
drink
really
just
didnt
work
for
me
on
any
level
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
smooth
and
refined
brew
that
does
not
need
to
be
bold
or
rich
it
is
solid
and
well
proportioned
making
it
a
perfect
winter
brew
cheers
im
not
a
big
fan
of
lagers
the
american
macro
market
has
destroyed
my
respect
for
the
style
especially
after
going
to
germany
and
finding
that
their
standard
lagers
while
better
than
a
bud
are
still
lacking
in
every
category
recently
however
ive
been
privy
to
some
outstanding
lagers
changing
my
opinion
so
if
you
think
my
review
is
a
bit
high
for
this
one
just
know
that
im
reviewing
80
for
the
style
and
20personal
taste
it
accomplishes
something
many
lagers
try
to
achieve
the
hops
are
still
important
but
there
is
a
great
malt
character
for
such
a
traditionaly
hoppy
and
thin
style
of
beer
very
nice
overall
winter
skal
is
another
very
good
lager
i
wish
more
breweries
had
the
skills
to
pull
something
like
this
off
its
still
european
in
nature
but
wth
just
a
touch
of
the
americas
to
make
it
different
a
very
nice
lager
here
i
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
while
traveling
in
wisconsin
a
great
session
beer
flavor
is
smooth
and
subtle
well
thought
out
and
put
together
invites
you
to
drink
more
than
one
it
is
not
powerful
extreme
or
complex
but
still
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
easy
to
drink
quite
pleasant
d
this
beer
is
very
clean
and
has
some
nice
flavors
but
the
tartness
is
a
bit
off
and
breaks
up
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
drinkability
notmally
not
my
favorite
style
seems
to
be
a
catch
all
that
catches
soem
crap
howver
i
found
this
beer
to
be
malty
and
substantial
d
overall
a
very
solid
beer
nothing
terribly
outstanding
but
it
is
refreshing
and
relatively
wellpriced
try
it
its
good
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
wasnt
priced
too
bad
i
think
just
over
7
for
a
6pack
d
easy
drinking
but
nothing
exciting
single
from
rileys
in
madison
brought
back
in
a
suitcase
drinkability
is
average
kind
of
depressing
to
drink
winter
is
already
depressing
enough
this
only
adds
to
it
woah
where
did
that
come
from
this
beer
was
much
thicker
than
a
bmc
but
i
couldnt
help
but
think
the
flavor
was
similar
cheers
beertracker
a
believable
take
on
german
brewing
that
really
hits
the
spot
drinkability
not
the
most
interesting
or
fun
red
ale
out
there
but
still
quite
sessionable
drinkability
notes

so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
solid
flavor
profile
i
like
this
beer
but
its
not
really
heavy
enough
to
be
a
winter
beer
more
of
a
fall
beer
in
my
mind
light
orangecopper
color
very
clear
only
has
a
faint
head
that
evaporates
quickly
leaving
it
looking
a
bit
dull
aroma
of
mild
hops
and
bready
caramel
malt
hits
the
nose
with
also
a
hint
of
peppery
citrus
spice
taste
is
stronger
on
the
malt
side
with
a
breadiness
up
front
the
finish
has
a
slight
nutty
sourness
though
not
bitter
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
watery
fairly
smooth
it
has
adequate
carbonation
the
flavor
doesnt
get
you
too
excited
but
theres
not
much
bad
you
say
about
this
brew
the
alcohol
seems
pretty
low
and
i
would
say
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
lasts
for
about
2
minutes
and
shrinks
to
a
thin
film
with
the
first
pour
lacing
lasting
but
none
down
the
glass
dont
get
much
from
the
smell
but
i
do
get
a
hop
and
slightly
peppery
presense
and
a
good
pilsner
malt
aroma
tastewise
a
good
hop
presense
with
bready
malt
and
some
carmelization
mildly
fruity
and
a
hint
of
pepper
mouthfeel
is
good
and
it
feels
like
a
good
deal
of
alcohol
enough
to
feel
like
a
winter
warmer
another
good
session

from

session
pint
poured
at
quiveys
grove
in
fitchburg
wi
this
beer
has
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
head
malty
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
occasional
bursts
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
very
much
like
grain
capital
beers
really
give
you
a
sense
of
the
flavor
of
the
ingredients
that
go
into
beer
lightly
fruity
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
noticable
this
beer
does
not
have
the
most
complex
flavors
but
i
enjoy
it
served
a
bright
orangeamber
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
nose
is
musty
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
fruitycitrus
taste
continues
with
an
oktoberfest
mustiness
some
floral
hoppiness
and
light
fruits
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
slick
the
alcohol
seemed
on
the
high
side
for
an
amber
lager
but
was
welcome
as
it
was
about
5
degrees
outside
a
nice
winter
warmer
from
capital
minus
the
overdone
spiceyness
of
most
yet
another
version
of
a
session
lager
from
capital
brewery
winter
skål
pours
a
dark
amber
with
little
head
retention
or
lacing
it
smells
rather
subdued
and
malty
at
that
but
tastes
judiciously
hopped
theres
a
bit
of
mustiness
and
the
mouthfeel
has
a
significant
amount
of
harshness
to
me
this
feels
like
they
just
threw
some
hops
into
their
oktoberfest
still
the
hops
are
welcome
and
this
is
a
tasty
winter
beer
option
for
those
looking
to
escape
the
ranks
of
winter
warmers
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
beer
back
when
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
weather
was
more
seasonal
which
makes
this
beer
a
good
try
the
thing
that
brought
me
to
this
beer
was
that
it
was
brewed
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
capital
so
i
thought
to
give
it
a
try
i
purchased
this
one
at
my
favorite
liqour
spot
when
i
was
in
whitewater
for
college
coridos
liqour
locker
when
i
got
home
i
popped
off
the
top
and
started
to
enjoy
it
i
was
suprised
at
how
sweet
the
beer
was
seeing
that
capital
to
me
is
more
bitter
than
usual
after
that
it
was
surely
enjoyable
when
the
time
is
right
and
if
you
have
a
lady
friend
youll
appreciate
this
beer
more
than
often
on
those
cold
wisconsin
night
cheers

a
slightly
hazy
light
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
have
good
retention
nice
lacing
too
the
smell
has
a
pilsener

aroma
to
it
with
a
decent
amount

and
full
for

a

bit
of
biscuit

well
the

this
beer
gets
right
down
to
business
biting
the
tongue
with
a
sharp
burning
fizziness
as
it
enters
the
mouth
this
biting
subsides
as
the
beer
slides
closer
to
home
and
is
evocative
of
honey
and
a
light
sweetness
as
it
takes
the
plunge
down
the
throat
it
may
have
been
my
imagination
but
the
beer
as
it
journeys
along
the
tongue
shooting
off
new
impressive
flavors
as
it
moves
like
a
wagon
full
of
ignited
fireworks
seems
to
produce
a
sensation
of
a
sort
of
rolling
the
beer
the
flavor
that
is
has
its
own
character
that
feels
like
its
determined
to
make
you
keep
enjoying
the
beer
well
after
the
last
of
it
has
been
carefully
swallowed
also
it
burps
well
pours
an
orangeamber
with
a
sticky
light
khaki
head
nose
is
filled
with
caramelized
vegetables
brown
sugar
faint
spice
and
spicy
vegetal
hops
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
very
vegetabley
yet
sweet
with
caramally
malts
hops
provide
ample
balancespicy
and
green
finish
is
sweetish
with
light
bitterness
nice
light
carbonation
enhances
the
full
thick
mouthfeel
robust
amber
lager
but
goes
down
easily
overall
this
probably
isnt
a
beer
id
buy
again
id
much
rather
drink
schell
firebrick
or
even
capitals
autumnal
fire
every
capital
beer
ive
ever
had
is
flawed
in
a
minor
way
but
these
flaws
are
never
enough
to
keep
me
from
drinking
several
of
them
or
trying
a
new
capital
production
or
style
easy
to
drink
and
complex
enough
to
keep
me
interested
theyre
always
very
good
overall
i
would
say
that
as
far
as
a
winter
offering
is
concerned
this
is
certainly
interesting
a
good
beer
another
of
my
spoils
from
wisconsin
the
beer
pours
a
nice
redamber
color
with
2
fingers
of
head
that
is
rather
fleeting
pretty
much
what
i
would
expect
here
the
nose
is
caramel
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
what
a
marzen
smells
like
touches
of
the
funk
of
a
lager
but
not
offensive
as
other
lagers
can
be
the
flavor
is
nice
for
a
lager
the
flavor
is
caramel
and
some
hints
of
toffee
its
like
a
killians
red
but
actually
good
the
feel
is
right
at
the
interface
between
moderate
and
thick
with
hints
of
a
creamy
texture
in
there
good
good
beer
drinkability
is
good
as
well
the
aftertaste
sticks
on
sweet
and
a
hint
grainey
it
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
i
do
like
the
beer
a
lot
not
neceassarily
what
i
want
in
a
winter
beer
but
it
is
very
good
non
the
less
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
soft
and
delicate
carbonation
in
a
medium
body
very
easy
drinking
here
it
fits
in
with
most
of
the
capital
beers
though
not
too
exciting
pretty
copper
hue
with
a
nice
white
head
its
crystal
clear
nice
balanced
aroma
malty
sweet
and
nutty
some
floral
hops
and
a
crisp
and
spicey
yeast
aroma
good
malt
flavor
upfront
bready
then
nutty
with
mild
bitterness
it
finishes
clean
with
a
sparkling
carbonation
and
a
caramel
aftertaste
this
beer
wont
make
me
excitied
for
winter
as
capital
claims
but
it
may
help
the
time
pass
more
easily
rich
and
satisfying
capital

winter
skal
delivers
a
straghtforward
oktoberfestbocklike
lager
thats
captivating
and
drinkable
its
clear
auburn
body
rests
gently
beneath
a
short
head
of
offwhite
foam
that
drops
steadily
to
an
average
collar
and
leaves
only
traces
of
lace
about
the
glass
its
distinctly
malty
in
the
aroma
with
only
a
hint
of
floral
hops
in
the
background
the
body
is
decidedly
medium
and
combines
with
its
moderate
carbonation
to
leaves
it
silky
smooth
and
creamy
across
the
palate
rich
grainy
munich
malt
dominates
the
flavor
its
wellbalanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
and
tempered
by
its
mild
floral
and
spicy
hop
flavors
the
alcohol
never
becomes
apparent
and
although
its
not
particularily
complex
it
never
fails
to
satisfy
an
exceptional
winter
seasonal
that
doesnt
have
to
rely
on
spices
or
fruit
to
earn
its
place
at
your
table

a

a
spicy

flavor
that
fades

arrive
nothing

nothing
harsh

id
seek
this
one
out
again
winter
skal
is
one
of
the
best
capital
beers
that
ive
had
yet
considering
the
style
its
one
damn
fine
winter
seasonal
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nothing
outstanding
but
well
made
beer
it
was
poured
with
a
very
minimal
head
maybe
that
was
just
the
server
and
it
didnt
really
stick
around
or
come
back
with
swirling
it
was
a
deep
dark
amber
color
the
aroma
was
subtly
but
mostly
hoppy
the
taste
was
strongly
hoppy
with
a
floral
nature
and
a
definite
bitterness
it
finished
with
a
mild
malty
sweet
flavor
with
hints
of
nuttiness
i
didnt
think
it
was
carbonated
enough
overall
big
thanks
to
bighuge
for
this
one
my
fourth
capital
brewery
beer
and
another
good
one
worth
keeping
an
eye
out
for
this
one

cutting
into
a
soft
malt
with
a
growing
hop
spice
that
cuts
into
the
mid
palate
with
an
agressiveness
the
finish
marks
the
arrival
of
the
caramel
hinted
at
in
the
aroma
finally
mixed
with
spicy
hops
and
dried
fruits
kind
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
but
very
easy
to
drink
nice
beer
here
looks
exactly
like
a
glass
of
iced
tea
clear
brown
with
very
little
carbonation
and
a
white
head
that
shrinks
to
just
covering
the
top
of
the
beer
smells
exactly
like
a
red
should
a
little
sour
a
little
malt
tastes
fruity
and
a
little
hoppy
a
fine
red
but
not
something
i
would
reach
for
on
a
cold
winter
night
pours
a
beautiful
copper
with
a
red
tinge
to
it
and
a
nice
creamy
off
white
head
that
trails
all
the
way
down
the
glass
nicely
toasty
malt
is
the
only
aroma
that
my
cold
filled
nose
will
let
through
great
mellow
toasty
maltiness
throughout
that
seems
to
just
glide
across
your
tongue
with
some
subtle
earthy
hops
at
the
end
smooth
and
soft
as
it
glides
across
my
palate
this
brew
is
a
joy
to
drink
i
havent
been
reviewing
much
lately
but
this
brew
may
have
turned
that
trend
around
very
tasty
and
not
heavy
or
cloying
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
a
big

it

a
nice

light

seems
kind

bland
and
watery
overall
not
all
that
bad
but
average
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
was
disappointed
i
expected
a
hearty
old
ale
this
is
just
a
lager
but
a
special
one
it
is
not
spiced
or
anything
like
that
but
i
would
put
the
quality
of
this
lager
up
against
anything
brewed
sweet
almost
vienna
style
maltiness
but
balanced
with
a
perfect
husky
hoppy
finish
just
a
splendid
beer
somewhat
of

dark
copper
color
on
the
pour
a
small
white
head
that
wants
to
take
off
early
some

this
is
an
interesting
concoction
reminded
me
of
sam
adams
double
bock
on
the
first
taste
some
caramel
taste
slight
hop
bitterness
theres
no
listing
of
the
alcohol
content
but
it
might
be
a
little
higher
than
some
ill
say
this
next
winter
i
will
pick
up
another
6er
of
this
brilliantly
clear
ruddy
bronze
hue
topped
by
an
ivory
white
uniformily
thick
well
retained
head
sparse
lace
remains
the
aroma

of
grassy
and

noble
hops

by
mellow
toasty
munich
and
medium
caramel

sweetness
snap
of
candyish
sweetness

is

by
mellow
toast
and

hop
bitterness
is
evanescent
allowing
sweetness
to
quickly
reemerge
along
with
a
mildly
toffeeish
caramel
malt
and
melanoidin
combination
mid
palate
herbal
hop
flavor
adds
a
mellow
chlorophyll
tinged
contrast
moderately
bodied
overall
but
a
touch
thin
and
fleeting
in
mouthfeel
finishes
lightly
sweet
and
bready
but
otherwise
clean
and
crisp
winter
skai
is
a
unique
balanced
brew
it
seems
to
occupy
a
precarious
niche
between
dunkels
and
hellesbocks
having
elements
of
both
tasty
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for

the
bottle
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
bubblyfoamy
head
that
fizzed
away
after
a
minute
and
had
some
light
patchy
lace
smell
is
very
nice
its
a
sweet
fruity
delight
of
green
grapes
along
with
a
bit
of
apple
and
peach
and
has
a
smoothing
sweet
malt
backing
the
smell
and
taste
was
very
close
to
hales
wee
heavy
winter
but
just
a
tad
lighter
the
taste
is
mild
and
light
with
a
clean
sweet
smooth
malt
with
a
very
slight
and
mildly
bright
hop
thats
citrusytangy
just
a
bit
of
green
grapes
and
apple
all
very
subtle
and
smooth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
silky
smooth
has
a
interesting
light
tang
hold
that
reminds
me
of
a
wet
wine
and
gets
barely
dry
in
the
finish
this
is
very
drinkable
and
is
a
very
subtle
intesting
beer
yep
i
liked
it
thank
you
may
i
have
another
the
color
on
the
pour
a
limpid
deep
copper
the
head
portly
in
size
frothy
in
texture
and
a
nice
light
tan
color
as
it
dissipates
the
lace
left
behind
seals
off
the
glass
personally
i
think
this
a
sign
of
a
wellbrewed
beer
along
with
the
bazillion
tiny
bubbles
lifting
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
malt
and
lightly
sweet
musty
and
a
tad
yeasty
fresh
and
pleasing
the
nose
on
this
beer
start
sweet
lots
of
malt
top
moderate
in
its
feel
finish
has
a
delightful
hop
spicy
presence
the
carbonation
tolerable
and
the
aftertaste
somewhat
dry
quite
a
quaffable
brew
it
is
true
try
one
100403
just
had
a
bottle
from
last
years
batch
the
other
day
and
must
append
this
caveat
to
the
above
bit
of
diffidence
maybe
it
got
better
over
the
months
or
maybe
my
mind
and
tastes
have
been
altered
but
its
better
than
i
said
much
better
when
the
new
batch
comes
out
ill
do
a
better
one
what
a
great
appearance
this
beer
has
shiny
amber
and
a
rather
large
creamy
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
strong
maltiness
is
in
the
aroma
nice
caramel
nature
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
creamy
very
smooth
beer
flavors
of
malt
sweetness
and
caramelization
hit
first
and
then
some
hops
are
evident
through
the
finish
im
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
bought
it
on
a
whim
and
got
lucky
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
especially
gorgeous
on
tap
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
what
i
expected
for
a
seasonal
winter
beer
but
i
warmed
to
it
very
quickly
copper
in
color
with
a
light
beige
head
malty
aroma
smells
too
much
like
the
spent
grain
we
used
to
feed
our
dairy
cows
when
i
was
growing
up
for
my
liking
nice
lightly
roasted
malt
flavor
that
is
well
balanced
by
the
hops
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
had
capitals
summer
tour
pack
and
felt
the
beers
were
all
good
and
a
couple
were
very
good
this
peaked
my
interest
in
their
winter
skal
which
thanks
to
bighuge
i
was
able
to
obtain
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
it
didnt
acheive
that
very
good
to
exceptional
score
in
my
book
that
i
was
hoping
for
pours
amber
with
a
malty
spicy
smell
the
taste
is
big
on
caramel
malt
and
the
hops
start
to
come
through
as
it
warms
i
can
see
why
others
might
call
this
a
lager
rather
than
an
ale
whatever
it
is
i
enjoyed
it
and
im
sure
i
will
enjoy
the
remaining
three
poured
a
clear
copper
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
signs
of
carbonation
present
in
3
columns
of
small
bubbles
aroma
primarily
consists
of
malts
and
hops
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
mild
carbonation
tingle
in
the
middle
bready
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
spiciness
in
the
finish
very
reminiscent
of
an
oktoberfest
not
what
i
expected
in
a
winter
seasonal
beer
but
very
good
nontheless
clear
copper
color
not
much
head
to
describe
just
a
trace
in
45
seconds
firm
but
not
heavy
sense
of
caramel
to
the
malty
aroma
satiny
mouthfeel
sense
of
brown
sugar
and
good
toast
impressions
hop
sparkle
close
to
the
swallow
whats
somewhat
dissappointing
is
the
midmouth
flavor
the
early
malty
tastes
seem
to
vanish
giving
this
beer
an
awkward
pause
in
the
middle
this
beer
is
good
and
a
step
away
from
being
truly
solid
capital
winter
skal
cripes
i
know
its
the
dead
of
summer
but
they
sold
it
to
my
wife
last
week
so
its
gotta
be
reviewed
hey
not
bad
deep
red
beer
with
a
great
big
hops
aroma
good
sign
in
june
the
taste
was
full
of
malt
with
a
pleasant
spiciness
followed
up
with
hops
in
the
follow
through
and
the
aftertaste
not
bad
for
an
old
beer
thank
you
hops
ill
look
for
this
next
dec
21
lighter
amber
in
color
and
clear
medium
and
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
complex
with
qualities
of
malt
and
hops
plus
alcohol
and
an
almost
spicy
quality
has
the
thinner
quality
of
a
lager
yet
a
heartiness
to
it
taste
is
complex
too
with
the
hop
bitterness
dominating
but
the
caramel
malt
helping
to
rounding
it
off
and
make
it
very
smooth
pretty
dry
finish
and
that
remains
for
a
lingering
aftertaste
this
is
as
complex
a
lager
as
i
have
tasted
it
has
the
vienna
qualities
of
a
lager
with
maltiness
and
smoothness
of
a
california
common
this
is
just
an
outstanding
lager
it
is
my
favorite
lager
of
all
time
it
has
a
beautiful
appearance
and
smell
delicious
taste
and
a
smooth
clean
finish
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
one
sitting
meh
being
organic
is
a
selling
point
and
this
makes
a
nice
companion
to
this
brewerys
original
organic
pale
lager
see
that
review
safe
should
appeal
to
the
masses
and
those
just
venturing
forth
into
sleemans
or
rickards
land
from
paler
climes
overall
an
okay
lager
a
point
for
the
organic
ingredients
a
step
up
from
the
plain
mill
st
organic
but
nothing
brilliant
not
to
sound
petty
but
i
still
cant
over
that
this
socalled
amber
lager
is
actually
bright
gold
it
speaks
to
the
fact
that
this
recipe
lacks
virtually
all
the
components
intrinsic
to
the
style
even
the
most
basic
element
colour
thats
listed
right
there
in
beers
name
almost
designed
as
a
hybrid
between
organic
and
tankhouse
100th
meridian
isnt
as
good
as
either
o
ok
drinker
middleofthe
road
accessible
beer
overall
an
easy
drinking
amber
lager
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
nothing
too
complex
with
this
brew
just
a
simple
malty
lager
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
by
fairly
bland
flavors
and
aromas
enjoy
overall
a
pretty
decent
amber
that
has
a
really
good
smell
and
taste
but
cant
quite
measure
up
across
the
board
to
some
of
the
best
nevertheless
something
i
wouldnt
turn
down
if
offered
again
final
thoughts
i
heard
a
rumor
that
this
beer
was
brewed
to
have
the
ibu
dead
between
mill
st
organic
and
mill
st
tankhouse
and
thats
really
what
this
beer
taste
like
a
dead
center
compromise
on
the
very
smooth
and
easy
but
mild
lager
and
the
more
robust
hoppier
character
of
tankhouse
for
what
that
is
worth
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
beer
thumbs
up
overall
while
not
all
that
exciting
it
does
fit
the
bill
of
an
amber
beer
not
an
american
amber
though
not
much
hops
and
no
fruity
flavours
kind
of
like
a
less
sweet
version
of
their
tankhouse
a
relatively
ok
lager
probably
a
slightly
better
than
average
in
the
organic
beer
realm
as
well
final
grade

a
solid
b
mill
streets
100th
meridian
is
a
straightforward
tasty
little
organic
beer
that
most
beer
enthusiasts
should
find
highly
agreeable
i
rarely
purchase
mill
street
products
outside
of
these
samplers
every
few
months
but
this
is
a
brew
that
id
definitely
return
to
if
it
were
to
become
available
in
a
more
convenient
format
this
is
the
sort
of
brew
that
regular
beer
drinkers
and
bas
alike
should
be
able
to
enjoy
equally
well
worth
including
in
future
samplers
overall
a
finely
balanced
and
tasty
beer
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
mill
street
pretty
good
stuff
a
wellwrought
amber
lager
the
organic
nature
merely
an
unused
sidebar
to
me
im
just
glad
that
it
doesnt
seem
to
screw
anything
up
flavourful
rounded
and
pretty
tasty
overall
more
lagers
need
to
be
made
in
this
fashion
as
if
to
debunk
the
american
myth
of
bland
cheap
tainted
caramel
stepups
from
yer
typical
adjunct
swill
and
thats
every
single
fucking
thing
i
know
on
the
matter
part
of
the
summer
mixed
six
pack
this
is
a
totally
credible
attempt
at
a
preprohibition
lager
much
like
sam
adams
lager
nice
hops
and
malt
mix
with
a
long
finish
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
part
of
the
regular
lineup
totally
session
able
yet
interesting
enough
to
warrant
buying
again
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
malt
aftertaste
this
one
is
not
for
me
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
no
for
a
brown
beer
there
is
much
better
i
was
a
bit
disappointing
i
wish
the
beer
would
have
more
flavour
but
overall
is
it
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
goes
down
dry
smoothly
but
if
you
wanna
drink
a
sleeman
get
something
else
a
staple
of
mine
in
my
younger
days
delivers
on
its
namesake
color
and
has
a
solid
4
finger
head
to
show
for
itself
nutty
flavor
with
some
sweet
caramel
decent
and
good
though
tame
to
be
sure
341
ml
bottle
nice
colour
smooth
i
liked
it
better
after
it
warmed
up
a
little
o
the
one
thing
thats
really
off
on
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
other
than
that
its
much
better
than
i
expected
i
should
probably
credit
sleeman
for
helping
me
to
graduate
beyond
molson
pilsener
saskatchewan
boy
elixir
of
choice
to
a
much
wider
world
of
beer
styles
and
legit
qualityfocused
breweries
but
a
that
doesnt
mean
one
cant
turn
an
objective
eye
towards
these
canadian
standbys
now
and
b
do
not
presume
that
sleeman
is
necessarily
one
of
the
latter
breweries
sleeman
was
a
transitional
step
i
likely
consumed
a
disturbing
number
of
honey
browns
and
cream
ales
during
my
grad
school
days
so
this
trip
back
into
sleemanland
onterrible
was
tinged
with
some
nostalgia
oddly
enough
i
used
to
think
this
was
an
ale
despite
the
term
lager
being
right
there
in
the
name
i
suppose
the
goal
of
drinking
back
then
wasnt
to
pay
close
attention
also
woodys
tap
house
only
has
so
many
wares
to
sample
it
was
this
or
something
from
a
clear
glass
bottle
that
rhymes
with
borona
in
any
event
sleeman
honey
brown
on
tap
is
a
very
light
burnished
bronze
color
looks
quite
watereddown
with
traces
of
white
foam
skittering
on
the
surface
aroma
is
sweet
boiled
grains
ephemeral
brown
sugar
or
caramel
lemon
rind
a
sourish
apple
fruitiness
and
perhaps
a
hemp
seed
nuttiness
palate
is
a
blend
of
different
malt
and
hopsgenerated
effects
i
get
sweet
white
bread
sour
vines
candy
play
dough
dilute
citrus
iced

and
interestingly
enough
some
cooking
molasses
more
dark
malt
character
than
expected
nice
less
optimistically
however
the
whole
watery
package
is
flavoranemic
everything
interesting
is
ramped
down
in
favor
of
enough
gas
and
bubbles
to
launch
a
hot
air
balloon
crisp
and
dry
finish
does
include
a
pleasant
haylike
sweetness
not
fantastic
but
there
was
enough
interest
here
to
make
me
masochistically
wonder
what
the
cream
ale
would
taste
like
now
stay
tuned
gooby
pls
an
allaround
weak
flavoured
ale
smells
about
as
bad
as
it
tastes
this
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
colour
finishing
with
a
nice
foamy
twofinger
head
which
lasted
throughout
with
fairly
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
that
of
honey
and
grainy
malts
this
is
a
sweet
beer
with
a
faint
hint
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
medium
level
of
body
o
if
you
seek
a
very
well
rounded
session
beer
that
pleases
the
palate
dont
hesitate
pick
this
one
up
and
chances
are
you
wont
be
disappointed
its
an
average
beer
but
this
is
a
tasty
one
s
ganja
the
taste
has
a
bready
character
with
light
honey
sweetness
up
front
and
mild
yeast
in
the
taste
with
perhaps
a
slight
diacetyl
smoothness
and
caramel
in
the
malt
as
it
finishes
with
some
grain
and
honey
flavor
but
generally
mild
as
far
as
overall
taste
goes
this
is
a
pretty
standard
take
with
decent
taste
yet
not
exceptional
just
a
ordinary
viennaredamber
lager
easy
to
enjoy
and
smooth
had
this
on
a
recent
business
trip
to
the
cambridge
ontario
area
really
pretty
good
beer
that
goes
well
with
most
any
food
paired
this
time
with
schnitzel
and
braised
cabbage
this
beer
looks
and
smells
really
great
with
a
caramel
honey
brown
bred
smell
it
is
good
it
is
not
amazing
but
really
good
in
winter
because
i
dont
like
it
in
summer
the
mouthfeel
isnt
amazing
but
it
isnt
bad
too
overall
it
is
ok
but
i
dont
like
it
that
much
too
in
fact
it
is
a
very
little
over
average
but
if
you
cant
find
it
dont
go
crazy
over
all
simply
awesome
doesnt
taste
like
lager
better
i
usually
drink
micro
brewery
beers
but
this
one
is
fine
by
me
and
my
wife
this
is
a
must
try
if
your
in
canada
this
is
a
joke
this
beer
is
not
worth
buying
thankfully
i
was
given
it
i
guess
the
color
is
alright
ruby
and
golden
but
the
head
is
nonexistent
smells
like
bad
cream
soda
left
out
in
the
sun
that
someone
poured
bud
light
into
taste
is
watery
way
to
sweet
and
then
at
the
end
theres
a
little
taste
of
malt
and
hops
that
give
you
a
slight
clue
that
what
youre
drinking
is
supposed
to
be
beer
dont
buy
this
please
the
liquid
appears
light
brown
maybe
a
few
shades
tanner
than
that
the
build
looks
light
and
the
bubbles
are
big
and
off
white
with
a
semi
tan
look
dies
down
no
lace
smell
is
caramel
forward
and
sweet
smelling
with
some
grainy
background
taste
is
grain
up
front
with
caramel
backing
with
what
i
would
call
sweetners
thats
all
i
really
get
feel
is
a
step
up
from
other
sleeman
beers
and
matches
the
style
a
light
crisp
carb
but
smooth
beer
none
the
less
drinkability
is
low
because
well
its
pretty
one
sided
originally
reviewed
12142010
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
not
one
i
search
for
but
often
is
the
best
thing
on
tap
in
a
sea
of
molsonlabatt
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavors
and
aromas
in
summary
unless
you
like
overly
sweet
overly
carbonated
honey
lagers
avoid
this
o
for
a
run
of
the
mill
mass
consumption
brand
its
decent
but
a
pretty
average
honey
brown
all
told
yeah
i
love
it
when
i
was
younger
the
first
beer
i
drank
was
probably
coors
and
i
was
not
impressed
shb
was
the
first
beer
i
had
that
i
thought
was
actually
interesting
and
i
still
have
a
soft
spot
for
it
its
not
boring
but
its
not
pretentious
either
o
a
pretty
bland
and
watery
lager
with
an
undesirable
mouthfeel
t
its
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
its
something
i
would
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
smooth
malts
and
some
honey
on
the
finish
youre
probably
better
trying
something
else
final
grade
3
05
a
c
overall
it
is
quite
drinkable
due
to
a
relatively
low
abv
but
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
to
drink
o
i
remember
a
time
when
this
was
among
my
favorite
brews
but
now
it
just
doesnt
hold
that
same
pizzaz
ive
moved
on
i
guess
to
bigger
and
better
beer
still
it
was
interesting
to
have
one
of
these
again
and
though
id
still
drink
this
its
not
what
i
remember
i
know
ive
had
this
on
tap
from
time
to
time
and
think
its
much
better
in
that
form
maybe
thats
whats
wrong
here
this
is
a
good
one
for
those
who
are
just
breaking
into
beer
or
new
styles
for
that
matter
but
trust
me
there
are
much
better
takes
on
this
style
o
not
exactly
a
great
beer
but
certainly
not
an
f
like
the
bros
say
o
either
my
palate
has
changed
a
lot
or
this
is
way
better
on
tap
i
dont
remember
this
beer
ever
being
so
bland
atleast
it
tastes
better
then
any
adjunct
lager
very
easy
to
drink
and
better
than
many
other
beers
at
the
same
price
point
not
crazy
but
i
would
rather
this
than
a
lot
of
other
macro
lagers
drinkability
pretty
sweet
without
offering
much
else
not
a
great
drinker
but
would
pick
over
most
mainstream
lagers
overall
not
a
bad
dark
beer
it
is
thick
with
lots
of
taste
to
go
with
it
a
bit
to
sweet
at
times
though
would
recommend
over
other
sleeman
beers
crisp
lightmedium
bodied
mouthfeel
drink
well
a
good
footballwatching
beer
473ml
can
the
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
toffee
without
too
much
else
the
flavor
is
toffee
with
a
light
amount
of
bitterness
and
flavor
from
some
grassy
hops
still
this
is
a
very
maltforward
beer
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
drink
definitely
the
best
beer
in
the
sleeman
lineup
if
there
are
no
better
beers
available
this
is
a
fairly
decent
choice
id
drink
it
again
d
not
a
very
good
beer
drinkable
id
its
all
there
is
but
other
than
that
i
wont
seek
it
out
was
at
an
event
and
this
was
the
best
beer
canadian
and
coors
light
were
other
choices
so
decided
to
go
for
it
since
i
havent
had
a
sleeman
honey
brown
in
year
or
so
pours
an
amber
brown
colour
with
thin
offwhite
head
without
much
lacing
smells
really
sweet
like
caramel
and
honey
without
much
else
flavour
is
pretty
muted
just
sweetness
comes
through
no
trace
of
any
hops
or
bitterness
carbonation
is
a
bit
aggressive
but
wasnt
bad
i
had
a
couple
so
drinkability
cant
be
that
bad
but
ill
never
get
this
unless
im
in
a
similar
situation
again
creamy
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
no
major
flaws
in
this
nice
fresh
glass
of
draught
just
not
a
lot
to
come
back
for
not
really
a
high
mark
a
bit
too
light
for
being
a
euro
dark
lager
d
this
one
is
easily
drinkable
nonoffensive
but
not
overly
memorable
i
would
never
turn
one
down
but
theres
plenty
of
other
offerings
within
this
style
which
offer
more
robust
flavours
the
name
pretty
much
sums
it
up
honey
brown
expect
a
sweeter
beer
with
its
share
of
malt
every
no
and
then
i
sip
a
honey
brown
at
a
bar
that
has
nothing
better
up
for
grabs
sadly
this
would
be
most
bars
here
in
calgary
a
brownish
amber
color
pour
with
a
small
foamy
offwhite
head
short
lasting
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
corn
peanuts
and
and
a
hint
of
metallic
hops
flavor
is
lightly
bitter
with
corn
lager
nuts
and
very
sweet
honey
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
medium
body
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
short
corny
finish
drinkable
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
md
mouthfeel
is
week
and
punctuated
by
the
different
flavors
all
of
which
you
want
to
choke
down
as
fast
as
possible
this
will
be
a
hard
one
to
get
through
thus
the
low
drinkability
gotta
love
all
the
tallboys
in
the
great
white
north
picked
up
a
16
oz
at
the
local
lcbo
poured
into
a
handy
glass
yields
a
well
honey
brown
imagine
that
color
nice
head
at
first
but
fades
quickly
taste
is
sweet
as
expected
it
starts
with
honey
sweetness
upfront
then
moves
into
a
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
matched
with
very
slight
bitterness
the
finish
stays
sweet
but
fades
to
a
tarty
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
great
good
carbonation
then
even
a
flavor
fizzy
finish
this
is
a
very
highly
drinkable
brew
not
sure
about
the
style
it
is
listed
as
i
dont
think
it
is
but
i
like
it
goes
great
with
many
foods
korean
barbecue
to
name
one
better
a
little
warmer
than
cold
sleeman
honey
brown
pours
a
light
amber
orange
with
a
thing
head
there
is
some
sweetness
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
some
skunkiness
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
toffee
in
the
flavor
and
some
sweetness
but
it
finishes
dry
and
muddled
the
body
is
on
the
heavier
side
i
would
say
this
could
be
a
slight
step
above
your
average
macro
if
it
wasnt
a
bit
skunked
drinkability
is
ok
nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
not
something
id
serve
if
i
wanted
to
impress
just
average
overall
an
average
beer
its
sad
to
think
that
i
use
to
like
this
stuff
the
last
time
i
had
it
was
thanksgiving
and
i
had
to
pour
it
in
the
grass
when
no
one
was
looking
too
sweet
awful
mouthfeel
and
extremely
overpriced
if
you
can
stay
away
but
if
not
dont
judge
canadian
beers
based
off
of
this
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orangeyred
body
with
a
thin
and
watery
looking
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
slightly
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
honey
taste
is
a
little
bit
of
honey
but
could
be
more
more
hops
and
water
than
honey
to
be
honest
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
a
fairly
innocuous
beer
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
would
not
hesitate
to
have
it
with
dinner
drinkability
was
pretty
good
to
wash
down
food
or
as
a
session
beer
nothing
great
but
not
bad
either
its
drinkable
enough
i
guess
ive
shared
pitchers
of
the
stuff
with
friends
before
and
its
not
terrible
as
an
accompaniment
to
pub
food
dont
pay
too
much
attention
and
it
goes
down
the
hatch
easily
its
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
canadian
macro
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
a
pleasant
change
from
the
typical
blond
lagers
for
being
what
it
is
a
mainstream
canadian
mass
produced
beer
it
fits
the
bill
nicely
and
its
not
all
that
bad
id
say
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
notes
skip
this
one
in
the
name
of
better
beers
with
flavor
that
deserve
your
time
and
energy
a
mediocre
macro
lager
not
much
to
speak
of
its
too
sweet
to
be
enjoyable
but
it
isnt
undrinkable
drinkability
not
a
great
session
beer
due
to
the
sweetness
waxiness
etc
has
some
okay
flavour
but
there
are
several
better
choices
final
thoughts
seriously
i
just
wish
i
could
concentrate
this
beer
slightly
more
if
the
scent
was
a
bit
stronger
and
the
flavor
more
pronounced
it
would
certainly
get
a
better
rating
that
being
said
id
gladly
pick
up
more
of
this
stuff
or
order
it
at
a
restaurant
with
my
meal
taste
more
sweet
and
maltiness
i
cant
really
pick
out
the
honey
flavor
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
more
or
less
innocuous
everyman
example
of
the
honey
beer
phenomenon
in
canada
and
parts
farther
removed
its
easy
to
put
back
a
few
of
these
sure
but
at
some
point
one
becomes
aware
of
this
particular
sort
of
acquiescence
to
blandlymade
universal
offerings
drinkability
sweetness
does
become
cloying
half
way
through
the
glass
not
for
hopheads
but
if
youre
looking
for
an
easydrinking
maltfocused
beer
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
drinkable
beer
good
to
pair
with
food
when
the
beer
is
on
tap
overpriced
though
and
nothing
to
brag
about
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
good
retentionand
a
pretty
decent
lacing
nose
is
of
honey
and
malt
body
is
medium
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
of
honey
up
front
with
a
bitter
sweet
fruity
finish
decent
balance
worth
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
pretty
lighttasting
beer
not
very
complex
like
a
brown
ale
or
usual
dark
lager
but
i
think
the
honey
effect
is
present
and
noticeable
overall
a
good
beer
if
i
saw
it
on
a
menu
id
definitely
have
another
not
too
bad
d
a
sweet
toasted
lager
with
slightly
above
average
drinkability
full
palate
inoffensive
flavours
finishes
sweet
with
spice
a
bit
fake
perhaps
a
bit
of
honey
not
overly
complex
that
is
for
sure
d
not
drinkable
unbelievably
bad
stay
away
you
have
several
thousand
other
beers
that
taste
better
to
spend
you
money
on
dont
be
a
fool
like
me
overal
i
thought
this
ok
honey
beers
are
becoming
more
common
and
this
one
was
better
than
a
few
ive
had
the
misfortune
to
try
i
will
have
a
few
more
if
there
are
any
left
when
i
revisit
the
shop
taste
is
sweet
but
not
unbearably
so
a
suprisingly
tasty
well
balanced
lager
a
pretty
good
hop
level
for
a
lager
it
would
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
who
finds
the
bigger
hop
styles
unpleasant
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
easy
going
brew
with
just
enough
honey
smooth
and
mildly
complex
decent
very
drinkable
smooth
with
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
havent
been
drinking
it
as
much
lately
because
of
cost
its
above
average
in
my
opinion
but
lacks
a
bit
of
unique
character
sleeman
definitely
brews
better
beers
than
most
bigger
canadian
companies
but
on
a
students
budget
i
havent
had
the
opportunity
to
try
some
of
its
other
brews

that
goes
down
not

but
leaves
a
musty
aftertaste
behind
not
to
my
liking
a
friend
went
to
canada
to
visit
family
and
brought
me
back
one
of
these
i
think
it
was
suppose
to
be
a
testament
to
the
quality
of
canadian
beer
the
brown
slightly
bubble
body
with
the
weak
head
didnt
impress
me
much
although
ive
seen
worse
the
smell
was
almost
nonexistent
especially
for
a
honey
induced
brew
the
taste
of
a
brown
with
a
slight
honey
flavor
was
light
but
present
very
light
watery
mouthfeel
drinkable
yes
it
goes
down
quite
easily
but
the
lack
of
flavor
and
the
wateriness
would
make
me
think
twice
and
possibly
choose
something
else
if
pressed
to
try
another
drinkability
good
enough
on
a
hot
day
and
goes
great
w
bbq
i
couldnt
see
myself
pounding
these
down
but
good
enough
to
enjoy
this
beer
actually
fares
better
than
most
sleeman
products
not
that
its
a
great
beer
but
it
avoids
any
critical
errors
that
would
kill
the

basically
ordinary

ill
be

to

a

in

but
not

for
another
pours
a
nice
nutty
browncaramel
color
the
offwhite
head
quickly
foams
up
then
disappears
the
smell
is
of
honey
and
is
sweet
the
taste
is
also
sweet
with
a
little
spice
from
the
hops
the
body
is
light
with
a
little
carbonation
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
fairly
drinkable
but
it
is
nothing
special
me
but
on
the
other
hand
its
your
good
basic
session
or
picnic
brew
d
this
wasnt
bad
it
just
didnt
grab
me
with
a
lot
of
flavor
not
the
best
offering
from
sleeman
this
is
great
tasting
beer
it
pours
an
orangy
red
colour
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
honey
it
works
well
on
the
cheeks
with
mild
carbonation
unlike
sleeman
cream
ale
which
is
way
too
fizzy
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clear
with
hints
of
fruit
and
honey
goes
down
well
and
tastes
great
with
barbecued
ribs
pours
a
medium
copper
brown
mostly
translucent
with
a
large
frothy
head
moderate
lacing
smells
pretty
sweet
malty
and
slightly
floral
taste
is
good
not
much
complexity
but
the
balance
between
the
sweetness
malts
and
hops
is
pretty
good
to
provide
a
very
easy
drinker
i
downed
the
first
one
rather
quickly
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
for
a
honey
lager
its
not
too
bad
i
might
pick
it
up
again
sometime
i
dont
think
ill
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
though
if
offered
drink
up
d
easily
approachable
but
too
sweet
for
me
to
session
ive
had
this
before
it
comes
in
stylin
clear
glass
bottle
with
raised
images
of
canadian
paraphanelia
beavers
and
maple
leaves
and
all
that
it
didnt
really
have
a
head
the
color
was
goldenbrown
the
smell
was
faintly
like
sweet
malt
but
its
very
faint
the
taste
isnt
much
of
anything
actually
just
light
and
tasteless
its
not
my
first
sleemans
choice
id
probably
choose
their
cream
ale
over
this
one
btwi
i
have
no
idea
why
the
site
would
list
this
as
a
dunkel
when
it
is
so
obviously
trying
to
imitatebadly
a
vienna
style
dyslexia
no
mistaking
it
this
is
macro
and
far
from
quality
craft
brewing
but
i
still
prefer
it
to
molbatt
clear
copper
color
from
a
can
as
im
spooked
by
clear
glass
bottles
the
head
goes
as
fast
as
the
local
maple
leafs
leave
the
playoffs
sweet
malt
smell
nice
smooth
beer
with
a
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
keeps
it
interesting
very
decent
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
decent
lager
nothing
groundbreaking
but
probably
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
low
due
to
skunking
would
have
a
much
better
from
tap
despite
that
it
still
has
something
going
for
it
color
is
an
orangeybrown
aroma
is
pretty
macrosmelling
but
the
taste
is
really
quite
pleasant
it
is
a
not
very
filling
lightly
carbonated
rather
sweet
beer
many
beers
have
honey
in
their
names
but
this
is
the
first
where
i
can
actually
taste
it
i
wont
be
a
regular
purchaser
of
this
brand
its
not
sold
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
anyhow
but
it
is
decidedly
not
bad
jh
cmon
sleemans
i
really
thought
you
had
something
here
taste
was
ok
with
some
caramel
some
smoke
and
a
slight
bitterness
all
not
very
outspoken
it
is
a
lager
so
not
very
fruity
or
yeasty
actually
it
was
more
like
a
dark
lager
and
if
i
would
have
been
blindfolded
i
would
probably
not
notice
the
difference
between
this
one
and
a
sweet
lager
not
what
comes
to
mind
when
discussing
a
dark
lager
but
i
digress
pours
out
to
an
amberish
brown
color
with
a
short
lived
head
of
foam
some
notes
of
lacing
and
a
medium
low
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
medium
bodied
malts
roasted
adjuncts
some
hops
a
touch
of
buttery
sweetness
not
bad
taste
is
middle
of
the
road
and
goes
down
quite
smooth
honey
maltiness
blends
with
mild
earth
and
grain
and
a
definite
note
of
toastiness
and
sweetness
toward
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
unremarkable
drinkability
is
average
not
bad
but
far
from
exemplary
d
not
bad
not
great
ive
had
worse
ive
had
better
taste
is
very
much
as
predicted
some
roasted
malts
and
a
cloying
caramel
sweetness
theres
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
though
not
complex
at
all
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
bitey
still
though
i
find
the
sweetness
a
bit
too
much
and
the
beer
comes
off
as
rather
unbalanced
toward
the
toothacheinducing
some
bitterness
would
have
been
very
welcome
drinkable
but
boring
and
average
to
be
sure
edit
tried
again
may
long
weekend

thanks
to
mike
jen
for
the
brew
i
stand
by
my
statement
that
this
is
the
best
honey
brown
on
the
market
and
the
best
sleemans
brew
nicely
carbonated
not
too
thin
mouthfeel
pretty
good
just
drinking
beer
drinkability
a
good
beer
that
is
easily
sessionable
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
of
this
drinkability
not
great
but
it
served
its
purpose
went
decent
with
the
shepards
pie
i
had
definatly
my
favourite
sleeman
beer
perhaps
id
even
say
my
favourite
honey
lager
or
ale
i
recommend
this
as
a
good
and
not
too
expensive
session
beer
sleeman
honey
brown
lager
is
my
first
sleeman
beer
im
less
than
impressed
a
brown
lager
euro
dark
lager
flavored
with
honey
sounds
like
a
good
idea
but
this
rendition
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
rarely
have
i
sampled
a
beer
that
tastes
as
artificially
flavored
as
this
one
does
no
thank
you
the
head
never
died
and
laced
the
glass
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
draft
not
comfortable
with
clear
bottles
amber
colored
small
white
head
thin
lace
left
on
glass
smell
of
floral
and
sweet
honey
hops
is
there
but
not
overpowering
taste
is
well
balanced
between
the
sweetness
of
malt
and
honey
and
hoppiness
nice
sweetbitter
combination
continued
carbonation
gives
a
smooth
finish
and
appropriate
mouthfeel
bit
of
a
metalic
aftertaste
i
find
in
all
sleeman
products
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
personally
prefer
big
rock
honey
brown
for
this
style
i
ended
up
having
one
of
these
while
i
was
in
montreal
and
the
other
choices
at
the
place
i
was
eating
were
such
luminaries
as
molson
ex
and
labatt
which
i
would
take
this
over
any
day
that
said
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
sleemans
is
that
they
saved
unibroue
my
favourite
brewer
though
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
product
bearing
their
own
name
well
i
certainly
wont
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
the
beer
decamps
the
clear
330ml
bottle
a
luminous
copper
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
that
frothy
and
light
tan
in
color
the
left
over
lace
a
thin
veil
upon
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
crisp
and
clean
with
the
start
sweet
and
nicely
malted
top
is
light
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
benignly
acidic
and
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
the
nose
is
straightfoward
and
gives
small
indications
of
both
the
malt
and
light
hops
the
flavor
is
a
tad
sweet
with
minor
balance
from
the
hops
there
is
a
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
noted
the
body
is
medium
and
lacks
crispness
overall
it
is
an
average
lager
beer
poured
out
a
copperbronze
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
head
that
stays
with
you
a
while
smell
was
quite
weak
very
light
with
some
caramel
and
buttery
tones
coming
through
but
again
very
light
taste
was
soso
a
little
bit
of
malts
showing
through
but
it
was
quite
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
a
little
too
much
sweetness
in
this
brew
aftertaste
was
just
plain
watery
with
nothing
going
on
afterwards
has
a
very
thin
body
to
it
which
would
drive
up
drinkablility
somewhat
for
having
some
flavors
but
the
sweetness
is
too
much
for
me
tasted
sweet
with
a
small
amount
of
hop
bitterness
some
graininess
an
average
tasting
beer
nothing
special
crisp
light
bodied
very
one
dimensional
very
grainy
and
proud
on
the
tongue
perfect
light
golden
color
and
strong
beer
taste
smells
like
beer
tastes
like
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
to
make
this
a
special
drink
and
unfortunately
all
styles
are
very
similar
i
include
the
cream
ale
honey
brown
lager
silver
creek
lager
and
original
dark
into
this
review
thx
pours
out
a
perfect
amber
colour
with
an
off
white
head
about
a
quarter
inch
thick
the
head
leaves
some
slight
rings
of
lace
there
are
some
straight
up
malt
aromas
going
on
ghost
like
grassiness
too
there
is
nothing
bad
about
the
taste
but
there
isnt
anything
too
the
taste
some
slightly
sweetened
maltiness
i
think
i
can
detect
some
bit
o
honey
involved
but
im
not
sure
smooth
crisp
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
light
body
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
while
not
a
great
beer
its
drinkable
and
i
could
find
nothing
terribly
wrong
with
it
besides
the
boring
and
bland
flavour
profile
i
had
a
pint
of
this
in
a
bar
it
did
not
have
much
head
and
what
it
had
left
after
a
little
bit
leaving
the
beer
just
sitting
there
a
little
honey
in
the
smell
but
nothing
special
there
the
taste
was
sweet
with
a
light
mouthfeel
not
much
carbonation
just
a
slight
honey
taste
in
the
beer
i
did
find
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
the
name
makes
the
beer
sound
better
than
it
is
drinkability
low
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
weak
and
skunky
it
has
a
lager
scent
but
i
cannot
detect
any
honey
or
crystal
malt
smell
the
taste
average
at
best
it
has
a
budweiser
type
taste
it
is
skunky
but
with
a
slight
malt
underlining
it
is
bitter
and
has
a
mild
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
massive
carbonation
it
drinks
decent
but
this
is
one
that
im
sure
to
never
buy
again
pours
out
to
a
dark
yellowish
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
not
good
and
gives
off
the
skunk
smell
associated
with
light
struck
beer
however
once
you
get
past
the
smell
the
taste
is
actually
quite
good
there
is
a
malty
sweetness
with
a
light
hop
finish
that
in
no
way
would
you
think
present
based
on
the
aroma
easy
to
drink
at
least
it
goes
down
without
a
fight
man
is
all
this
sleeman
stuff
such
junk
three
in
a
row
very
drinkable
the
taste
was
ok
and
the
alcohol
is
low
so
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
however
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
i
used
to
be
able
to
drink
a
fair
amount
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
it
doesnt
sit
well
on
my
palate
anymore
it
was
the
best
of
what
sleemans
put
out
in
my
opinion
and
yet
that
doesnt
seem
to
say
much
anymore
but
it
still
far
better
than
the
honey
brown
lager
that
big
rock
recently
concocted
that
isnt
saying
much
either
typical
tawny
brown
pour
with
smallish
off
white
head
much
carbonation
as
rivulets
of
bubbles
incessantly
make
their
way
to
the
top
aroma
is
only
average
with
some
roasted
malt
and
slight
hop
notes
nothing
exciting
in
the
taste
some
caramel
malt
slight
roasted
flavor
decent
mouthfeel
i
guess
you
can
do
alot
worse
than
this
one
but
for
me
this
is
pretty
pedestrian
by
comparison
to
what
i
usually
go
for
medium
brown
lager
with
a
subtle
taste
of
honey
regular
head
for
that
type
of
lager
probably
the
best
product
from
sleeman
but
i
still
dont
approve
of
the
clear
bottle
lack
of
spice
and
aftertaste
in
this
beer
the
malt
is
also
very
sweet
almost
like
a
light
beer
taste
the
best
of
the
sampler
pack
imho
although
its
still
not
far
above
average
if
at
all
the
honey
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
although
it
is
balanced
by
a
decent
dryness
finishes
well
and
doesnt
set
up
camp
in
your
mouth
like
the
original
dark
did
notes
please
beer
god
take
be
away
from
this
beer

perhaps
a
good
beer
to
cook
with
a
sweet
dark
beer
to
balance
out
a
pot
of
chili
or
beef
stew
as
for
drinking
it

no
thanks
never
again
a
little
on
the
bland
side
but
sometimes
you
are
not
looking
to
get
kicked
in
the
head
with
bold
flavours
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
the
honey
sweetness
is
well
balanced
here
making
it
a
decent
session
candidate
the
sweetness
might
start
to
infringe
on
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
beer
after
4
or
5
but
2
hit
the
spot
perfectly
this
one
is
surprise
surprise
and
surprise
bland
it
has
a
standard
lager
taste
and
what
honey
it
has
is
notable
only
in
the
smoothness
it
imparts
to
the
mouthfeel
and
a
hint
in
the
aftertaste
pours
without
much
head
leaving
little
lace
clear
amber
with
light
carbonation
nose
is
distinctly
skunky
which
is
disappointing
im
expecting
a
little
bit
of
honey
taste
does
have
some
sweetness
with
a
brief
hoppy
finish
fwiw
it
is
better
than
a
jw
dundee
has
more
body
f
the
head
is
minimal
and
laces
poorly
the
smell
is
inviting
with
a
fresh
lively
character
the
taste
is
smooth
with
a
very
noticable
honey
note
mouthfell
is
well
rounded
and
lingers
nicely
very
drinkable
over
several
hours
note
beer
is
sold
in
clear
glass
bottles
so
freshness
is
paramount
beer
suffers
terribly
with
agelight
this
beer
might
be
more
appealing
to
those
drinkers
who
like
miller
and
bud
its
clear
and
bronze
in
color
a
small
but
sturdy
head
of
fluffiness
stays
for
a
while
i
found
the
aroma
a
bit
skunky
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
not
much
skunkiness
in
the
taste
though
and
the
sweetness
sticks
out
i
found
it
rather
refreshing
and
drinkable
color
is
brownish
golden
yellow
some
big
bubbles
for
the
head
that
fizz
out
fast
smells
of
strong
sweet
honey
and
malts
taste
echoes
the
smell
smooth
with
a
honey
hop
tangyness
thats
a
little
rough
at
first
and
ends
with
a
nice
malt
coating
quite
drinkable
and
flavored
honey
lager
better
then
most
ive
had
has
more
solid
body
where
as
most
others
are
kinda
watery
the
definition
of
swill
is
this
beer
their
was
neither
taste
nor
smell
that
i
could
detect
expecting
a
skunk
smell
due
to
the
clear
bottle
i
practically
snorted
the
bottle
trying
to
detect
any
scent
whatsoever
nothing
tasted
like
water
in
shock
i
kept
looking
at
the
bottle
to
see
if
i
were
drinking
aquafina
by
mistake
the
appearance
was
alright
attractive
maple
leaf
gold
its
only
winning
attribute
aroma
was
a
tad
skunky
the
taste
was
of
a
nice
light
honey
and
non
lingering
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
which
cuts
back
on
drinkability
my
only
other
run
in
with
a
honey
beer
was
jw
dundees
honey
brown
and
this
is
no
comparison
much
better
mainly
due
to
its
milder
honey
flavors
that
are
by
no
means
overpowering
this
beer
is
a
clear
bronze
color
a
well
retained
beige
head
tops
it
off
a
little
mustiness
and
graininess
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
no
bad
off
flavors
or
anything
just
plain
ass
bland
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
throw
some
of
these
back
but
water
would
work
nicely
as
a
substitute
for
this
maybe
i
pick
up
a
little
bit
of
honey
and
the
crispness
that
goes
along
with
it
some
faint
maltiness
buy
something
else
theres
a
lot
better
than
this
out
there
clear
pale
brown
color
billowy
head
that
stays
at
12
inch
for
a
while
caramel
aroma
a
little
hay
smell
light
and
sweet
a
little
buttery
with
minimum
hop
impact
could
really
use
some
more
overall
oomph
its
watery
enough
to
be
pretty
much
done
by
the
back
of
the
mouth
a
little
impression
of
overcooked
celery
drinkable
i
suppose
its
a
little
more
subtle
than
some
honey
brews
in
heavy
sweetness
thin
and
muddy
in
appearance
and
taste
there
was
sweetness
but
none
really
seemed
to
come
from
the
malt
not
well
balanced
brown
coloration
medium
carbonation
taste
and
smells
of
artificial
caramel
flavoring
doesnt
blow
me
away
schells
dark
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
size
lacing
head
there
is
a
weak
aroma
some
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
light
nice
noticeable
roasted
malt
flavor
weak
body
a
little
flat
overall
its
not
great
nothing
special
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
pours
a
reddishmahogany
in
color
with
about
a
1finger
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layering
on
top
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
and
sweet
caramel
malts
pretty
much
is
the
same
for
the
taste
with
a
slightly
sour
finish
but
didnt
last
lighter
to
medium
bodied
overall
it
wasnt
a
bad
brew
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
order
it
in
a
pub
and
drink
it
again
if
nordeast
was
not
available
not
quite
as
good
as
a
nordeast
but
a
good
2nd
schell
has
done
another
great
job
i
usually
steer
clear
of
dark
beers
and
resisted
trying
schells
dark
i
often
associated
dark
beers
with
being
bitter
and
filling
this
was
not
the
case
i
loved
there
was
very
little
bitterness
a
very
refreshing
beer
light
malt
with
a
great
aftertaste
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
though
with
some
types
beers
i
have
one
and
i
am
done
i
will
usually
have
one
after
work
and
one
with
dinner
goes
great
with
meat
and
potatoes
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
bit
light
tasting
for
a
dark
was
hoping
it
would
have
more
and
richer
tastes
although
the
taste
that
it
has
isnt
bad
just
lighter
than
i
was
thinking
i
would
get
with
a
dark
o
a
nice
alternative
to
american
adjunct
lagers
but
really
nothing
special
there
is
very
little
to
recommend
or
criticize
with
this
beer
probably
could
use
a
bit
more
body
and
head
thanks
to
flax
for
this
one
final
thoughts
even
though
theres
not
much
in
the
aroma
or
taste
departments
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
highly
drinkable
and
there
are
no
off
flavors
unremarkable
definitely
not
my
favorite
schells
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
overall
nice
beer
to
grab
a
6
pack
of
for
a
fishing
trip
it
wouldnt
make
it
to
one
of
my
beer
parties
though
overall
at
first
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
like
this
beer
because
its
dark
but
i
was
mistaken
its
pretty
good
part
one
of
my
sixpart
intro
to
schells
regular
boys
it
pours
a
clear
amberrusset
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
caramel
light
grass
and
a
touch
of
rather
mild
roast
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
things
are
a
bit
stronger
allaround
and
a
small
bit
o
coffee
finds
its
way
in
there
as
well
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
little
brew
one
that
was
somehow
surprisingly
enjoyable
something
about
a
mdl
in
a
clear
bottle
just
advertizes
itself
in
the
wrong
way
to
me
something
i
could
see
drinking
plenty
of
if
presented
with
the
proper
circumstance
brown
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
slowly
faded
to
reveal
a
decent
layer
of
lace
left
on
the
top
as
well
as
a
good
amount
left
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
visible
carbonation
was
evident
through
the
chains
of
bubbles
streaming
up
through
the
very
clear
beer
smell
was
very
unique
it
had
a
nice
burnt
sort
of
smell
with
a
definate
hint
of
caramel
and
coffe
which
really
suprised
me
it
was
so
pronounced
almost
like
a
porter
type
of
hint
in
there
the
taste
was
very
similar
lots
of
coffee
and
caramel
flavors
mixed
in
with
a
nice
earthy
grain
and
a
slightly
bitter
hopped
back
light
to
medium
bodied
smooth
with
average
carbonation
this
is
a
dark
lager
done
right
i
have
had
this
before
many
times
not
sure
why
it
took
so
long
for
me
to
review
serving
type
bottle
o
this
is
not
a
life
changing
munich
dunkel
but
it
does
exactly
what
its
supposed
to
it
manages
to
balance
out
some
richer
flavors
with
a
solid
quaffability
at
a
decent
price
overall
a
decent
lighter
lager
flavors
are
very
subtle
but
this
brew
isnt
watery
at
all
overall
impression
it
isnt
bad
it
is
sort
of
a
generic
beer
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
your
average
macro
sort
of
like
a
yuengling
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
its
drinkable
enough
looks
deep
brown
reddish
around
the
fringes
small
head
that
doesnt
last
vague
smell
of
semitoasted
caramel
malt
taste
is
pretty
much
exactly
the
same
slightly
too
thin
a
body
for
my
liking
but
other
than
that
its
pretty
good
sadly
lacking
in
complexity
yes
but
it
is
certainly
not
bad
either
another
from
the
sampler
though
ive
had
plenty
of
this
on
tap
this
summer
as
my
teammates
love
this
stuff
im
not
as
big
a
fan
of
it
but
it
is
a
solid
dunkel
lager
and
a
good
changeup
from
lighter
lagers
nothing
spectacular
here
but
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
any
of
the
grainbelt
line
if
stuck
in
airport
waiting
for
a
delayed
swa
flight
id
probably
order
this
again
o
it
looks
great
but
it
only
tastes
soso
easy
enough
drinking
but
otherwise
its
a
pass
for
me
overall
a
great
looking
beer
that
is
sadly
lacking
in
smell
and
taste
would
not
recommend
to
try
go
for
schells
pils
instead
taste
of
honey
very
sweet
too
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
but
perfectly
willing
to
enjoy
one
if
handed
to
me
o
this
is
a
great
starter
beer
made
by
a
great
brewery
overall
good
for
hydration
not
unpleasant
but
what
flavor
there
is
is
very
very
mild
watery
sustained
taste
a
beer
you
can
rely
on
for
comfort
at
the
end
of
a
grueling
day
extremely
consistent
from
firsttaste
to
swallow
to
aftertaste
a
genuine
pleasure
from
start
to
finish
o
schells
brews
many
better
beers
than
dark
but
it
is
a
decent
lager
this
brew
is
quite
quaffable
as
it
is
tasty
and
medium
bodied
great
alternative
brew
to
session
with
if
only
the
taste
was
a
tad
richer
wed
have
a
real
winner
poured
to
a
big
3
fingered
head
with
big
bubbles
head
was
a
light
brown
in
color
left
a
little
lacing
but
not
much
brew
itself
was
a
dark
brown
in
color
smelled
slightly
sweet
also
of
burnt
malt
nothing
was
really
over
whelming
as
far
as
smell
goes
very
light
in
odor
taste
was
light
also
slightly
sweet
with
caramel
and
malt
not
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
either
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
good
i
guess
im
not
use
to
having
a
dark
beer
this
light
in
flavor
and
odor
overall
i
dont
think
id
buy
again
maybe
at
4
8
alcohol
this
is
going
to
be
a
light
dark
beer
no
pun
intended
smooth
rich
and
somewhat
complex
i
found
this
munich
dunkel
lager
particularly
refreshing
excellent
drinkability
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
from
this
wonderful
minnesota
brewery
schells
dark
was
dark
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
rocky
beige
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
toasted
malt
the
taste
was
toasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
hop
flavor
some
fruitiness
and
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
average
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
medium
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
just
above
aveage
this
is
an
average
dunkel
lager
pours
from
a
clear
bottle
labeling
and
bottle
together
bring
out
a
retro
feel
to
the
product
pours
a
dark
copper
ruby
brown
hue
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
quickly
dwindling
aroma
has
hints
of
grainy
malts
a
touch
of
caramel
and
tart
fruit
in
there
as
well
flavor
wise
roasty
maltshusky
graininessfruits
with
appleraisin
coming
through
with
a
touch
of
a
grassy
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
a
light
to
medium
bodied
lager
from
new
alt
minnesota
is
a
welcome
addition
to
the
beers
ive
tried
this
is
nowhere
near
penn
dark
was
its
hayday
but
its
a
decent
drinkable
beer
altogether
no
schells
best
product
but
still
very
quaffable
looking
forward
to
reviewing
more
schells
in
the
future
i
e
hopfenmalz
shmaltzs
alt
caramel
bock
firebrick
etc
d
very
drinkable
i
enjoy
the
malts
in
this
one
it
makes
it
creamy
and
smooth
it
is
a
lager
so
the
flavors
arent
strong
or
bold
but
they
are
still
there
not
saying
every
lager
is
mild
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
goto
beers
an
excellent
session
beer
cheers
taste
is
husky
and
sweet
with
equal
amounts
of
roasted
and
chocolate
maltiness
light
hopping
comes
in
to
clean
up
the
finish
it
is
unfortunate
there
are
not
many
american
brewed
dunkels
as
it
makes
for
a
flavorful
session
beer
that
is
easy
and
fun
to
drink
this
one
is
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
and
lacks
a
certain
smoothness
found
in
the
best
of
the
style
still
though
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
happily
buy
a
sixer
every
now
and
again
from
a
sampler
pack
since
miller
and
anheuser
still
control
the
distributors
and
retailers
here
this
good
stuff
has
to
fight
for
space
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
am
pretty
new
here
and
very
unprofessional
that
said
what
i
do
not
understand
is
the
biases
of
other
reviewers
rules
are
do
not
criticize
your
fellow
reviewers
but
i
gotta
say
art
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
i
rated
this
beer
high
before
i
read
anybody
elses
reviews
and
after
i
rated
it
high
and
reviewed
the
balance
of
the
thread
i
had
second
thoughts
until
i
started
reading
comparisons
to
some
beers
that
would
be
skipped
if
i
had
some
of
this
stuff
around
i
do
every
much
like
this
beer
anyway
this
is
above
average
darn
good
beer
leaving
a
fresh
after
taste
slightly
fruity
i
guess
you
certainly
arent
even
tempted
to
add
a
lemon
from
a
sixpack
sampler
bought
in
minnesota
appearance
is
a
dark
shade
of
amber
somewhat
small
head
and
very
little
lacing
smell
of
grain
and
caramel
while
the
taste
is
similar
with
an
interesting
sweetness
at
the
end
that
entices
another
sip
mouthfeel
is
not
quite
chewy
but
not
thin
either
kind
of
wish
i
had
more
than
just
this
bottle
very
good
beer
that
cant
be
found
out
here
not
too
bad
i
kind
of
like
it
actually
nothing
outstanding
but
worth
more
than
the
low
scores
i
see
here
d
could
put
a
few
of
these
down
but
the
offputting
flavors
are
a
little
too
prominent
for
prolonged
drinking
not
sure
what
the
logic
is
but
it
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
clear
colacolored
body
small
cream

some

malt
same
idea
with
the
taste
caramel
and
chocolate
tones
lagered
smooth
taste
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
but
its
blended
enough
that
its
hard
to
notice
somewhat
acidic
but
finishes
with
a
creamy
feel
nothing
particularly
wrong
or
anything
with
this
one
but
its
not
overwhelming
not
bad
skål
this
is
the
first
beer
from
schell
that
really
disappointed
me
but
having
this
after
their
stout
is
a
tough
act
to
follow
pours

with
lots
of
rising

which
makes
it
look
like
coca

of

no

theres
a
very
faint

in
the
overall
sweet
finish
theres
nothing
special
here
a
very
underrated
beer
though
not
aesthetically
pleasing
enough
for
a
huge
rating
for
those
of
you
that
rated
this
poorly
take
another
look
with
an
open
mind
and
warmed
slightly
maybe
this
is
schells
answer
to
shiner
bock
a
limp
and
light
beer
thats
a
teeny
bit
more
flavorful
than
your
usual
macro
flagships
people
can
drink
it
and
feel
fancy
since
its
a
dark
well
regardless
its
not
bad
certainly
and
its
actually
probably
a
step
up
from
shiner
and
other
bland
attempts
at
craft
beer
lighttomedium
bodied
with
a
lager
smoothness
this
is
an
easydrinking
brew
with
a
fair
amount
of
complexity
for
the
style
a
nice
caramelnuttyroasty
balance
a
fine
choice
for
a
dark
sessionable
lager
md
a
pretty
decent
brew
a
liked
the
smoothness
and
the
pretty
sessionable
quality
nothing
too
strong
very
enjoyable
i
recommend
at
least
trying
this
brew
i
will
purchase
again
d
very
drinkable
flavors
are
very
light
abv
is
very
light
overall
just
not
an
in
your
face
beer
not
filling
this
beer
is
decent
but
i
probably
wouldnt
ever
get
it
again
poured
from
the
clear
bottle
scary
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
deep
amber
brown
with
a
nice
cap
of
cream
colored
head
the
nose
is
sweet
with
lightly
toasted
malt
and
almost
takes
on
a
sweet
fruitiness
that
i
wasnt
expecting
the
flavor
touts
a
similar
fruitiness
but
it
is
subdued
compared
to
the
nose
other
than
that
caramel
molasses
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
watery
side
with
the
carbonation
not
helping
matters
in
that
it
is
almost
nonexistent
overall
drinkable
but
drinkable
like
bmc
beer
not
what
i
would
think
of
a
munich
dunkel
lager
to
be
like
i
suppose
given
the
choice
between
this
and
bmc
this
would
win
but
not
by
much
light
yet
the
flavours
keep
it
fairly
interesting
decent
beer
yet
nothing
to
seek
out
4
of
6
from
the
sampler
pack
i
have
not
been
disappointed
so
far
schells
may
become
a
regular
member
of
my
fridge
this
beer
finishes
out
with
a
soft
sweetness
and
medlight
body
i
must
say
it
was
better
than
i
had
expectedremebered
and
is
something
that
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
nothing
too
special
over
all
d
this
jumped
way
up
in
quality
with
the
first
sip
the
nose
is
almost
absent
and
the
head
is
a
bit
lacking
but
its
a
delish
beer
overall
that
i
could
put
a
few
if
not
more
down
of
the
clear
bottle
needs
to
go
though
if
you
are
a
malt
head
you
could
drink
this
all
day
long
period
d
good
i
was
scared
of
the
clear
bottle
and
the
fact
that
it
was
just
called
dark
but
it
wasnt
that
bad
really
sort
of
deceptive
in
color
and
smell
tasted
plain
and
somewhat
boring
but
not
bad
at
all
i
just
wanted
so
bad
to
rate
this
beer
higher
but
just
cant
i
love
schells
beers
and
a
trip
to
the
brewery
is
a
treat
unto
itself
but
for
some
reason
this
one
just
doesnt
make
it
the
color
is
weak
the
aroma
just
aint
there
the
flavor
leaves
something
to
be
desired
good
thing
this
was
a
8
0012pk
d
easily
the
worst
of
the
6
options
from
this
sampler
due
to
its
sweet
corn
graininess
and
artificial
caramel
type
of
flavor
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
again
god
thing
it
came
in
a
sample
sixer
schell
should
make
a
real
dunkel
this
is
an
american
dark
lager
da
decent
sessionable
brew
tasty
but
i
guess
its
not
a
betterthanaverage
brew
ive
always
enjoyed
schells
dark
and
this
brew
has
been
the
forefront
of
a
recent
last
several
years
rebranding
of
some
of
the
schells
brang
and
beers
probably
due
to
its
ease
of
drinking
and
accessibility
conclusion
soso
nothing
special
solid
brew
for
a
clear
bottle
very
much
the
sessionable
beer
at
4
8
d
the
light
body
and
low
abv
make
this
an
easy
beer
to
consume
its
not
terribly
complex
but
still
decent
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
but
im
left
wanting
more
during
the
entire
glass
more
aroma
more
flavor
more
body
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
dense
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
of
rich
malt
slightly
earthy
hints
of
noble
hops
as
well
nice
flavor
of
munich
malt
slightly
toasted
and
musty
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
nicely
kept
in
check
by
the
hops
bitterness
is
moderate
for
the
style
the
body
comes
off
as
a
little
thin
considering
the
richness
of
the
malt
a
little
overcarbonated
as
well
a
nice
dunkel
lager
that
is
very
drinkable
as
good
as
many
of
the
german
imports
drinkability
surprisingly
light
and
refreshing
for
a
dark
beer
with
dark
roasted
barley
easy
to
drink
would
definitely
have
another
if
it
was
around
not
sure
how
this
beer
is
rated
so
low
its
a
very
good
dunkel
like
everything
else
ive
had
from
schells
its
very
good
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
dark
lager
looks
dark
tastes
fairly
light
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
during
a
session
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
and
worth
the
try
sessionable
would
be
a
great
one
for
craft
beer
nubies
i
think
not
overpowering
in
any
way
mouthfeel
light
and
smooth
a
real
easy
drinking
beer
not
a
great
beer
but
its
something
i
would
suggest
to
a
new
craft
beer
drinker
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
its
not
great
in
any
aspect
but
its
easy
drinking
and
has
some
decent
flavor
my
wife
loves
this
stuff
and
is
not
a
beer
drinker
its
very
similar
to
a
newcastle
in
my
opinion
more
of
a
nut
brown
than
a
dunkel
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
their
newest
snowstorm
recipe
the
taste
does
not
however
i
most
likely
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
but
if
i
have
no
other
options
this
would
definitely
be
a
winner
d
i
rated
this
based
on
the
dark
american
lager
style
as
i
believe
this
was
the
brewerys
intent
based
on
the
packaging
for
ba
purposes
this
would
probably
fall
into
the
dark
euro
lager
category
nonetheless
it
is
extremely
well
crafted
and
should
be
recognized
as
such
i
think
its
a
very
clean
lager
and
extremely
quaffable
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
my
memories
of
lowenbrau
back
in
the
day
overall
it
was
fine
for
a
cheap
2
ontap
drink
but
i
cant
see
myself
ever
seeking
it
out
to
but
its
crisp
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
but
the
lack
of
flavor
didnt
make
me
care
if
i
finished
my
drink
or
not
dark
brown
color
cream
colored
head
of
an
inch
of
foam
smell
of
toasted
caramel
nice
aroma
solid
flavor
dark
malt
a
bit
nutty
nice
floral
hop
finish
good
body
not
too
heavy
smooth
great
sessional
doesnt
get
super
high
marks
but
was
one
of
my
favorites
on
the
day
i
would
definatley
have
another
if
it
was
available
this
isnt
a
porter
or
stout
this
is
just
a
darker
beer
done
right
who
cares
what
it
smells
like
or
what
flower
it
tastes
like
lets
be
honest
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
that
happens
to
come
from
the
2nd
oldest
family
brewerys
in
the
usa
please
dont
get
all
girly
on
us
if
you
want
a
good
tasting
beer
that
will
go
down
smooth
and
would
make
a
great
addition
to
deer
hunting
camp
then
this
it
the
beer
for
you
hello
the
beers
classification
on
this
site
is
munich
dunkel
while
the
bottle
proclaims
it
an
american
dark
lager
i
suspect
it
would
not
hold
up
well
at
all
if
reviews
held
it
to
the
standard
of
either
of
these
styles
d
this
beer
surprised
me
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
so
it
really
impressed
me
the
sweetness
can
sometime
be
a
little
cloying
making
it
a
bit
less
sessionable
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
frothy
and
recedes
slowly
into
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
nuts
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
considerably
lighter
than
the
aroma
there
are
is
still
some
nutty
caramel
but
it
is
rather
faint
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
if
the
taste
lived
up
to
the
aroma
as
it
is
an
average
beer
d
not
terrible
but
a
subaverage
brew
i
dont
like
this
very
much
and
its
a
bad
example
of
an
already
uninteresting
style
md
a
little
weak
on
the
feel
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
either
yeah
its
not
a
great
dunkel
but
its
a
nice
standard
american
interpretation
for
the
most
part
it
appears
a
dark
brown
with
light
tan
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
hint
of
dms
with
sweet
grains
the
flavor
is
pretty
subtle
with
an
initial
sweet
bready
rush
followed
by
a
gentle
chocolate
note
the
dms
is
distracting
but
not
surprising
not
a
bad
beer
after
drinking
mainly
dark
beers
and
stouts
since
i
started
throwing
down
and
subsequently
enjoying
the
brew
i
wanted
to
find
a
dark
beer
that
was
satisfying
but
not
filling
i
found
this
in
schell
dark
when
i
bought
my
first
case
of
schell
dark
it
was
in
a
colorful
package
calling
to
mind
the
region
it
was
born
but
not
in
an
overtly
exploitative
manner
the
bottle
is
clear
with
a
colorful
wrap
the
contents
are
a
dark
caramel
color
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
nice
barley
aroma
for
a
dark
beer
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
bite
but
there
was
very
little
bitterness
there
was
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
the
beer
went
down
smooth
and
it
would
be
good
as
a
session
beverage
the
clear
bottle
scared
me
the
previous
two
schells
ive
had
didnt
psych
me
up
the
label
reminded
me
way
too
much
of
a
hamms
or
schlitz
thing
all
that
hesitation
doesnt
help
what
is
basically
your
average
brown
ale
err
i
mean
munich
dunkel
lager
whatever
you
call
it
its
severely
average
overall
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
actually
it
was
very
enjoyable
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
the
best
from
august
schell
but
it
makes
for
a
decent
session
beer
originally
reviewed
on
september
24
2005
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
on
the
beer
train
deep
reddish
pour
dusty
malt
aroma
with
no
character
flavor
continues
im
detecting
a
pattern
here
with
these
guys
definately
some
corn
flavor
watery
blah
admitting
you
use
corn
to
build
a
dunkel
is
a
horrible
horrible
thing
to
do
on
par
with
swill
amberbrown
in
color
with
a
low
medium
head
the
smell
is
generic
caramel
malt
taste
is
caramel
and
roasted
malts
with
a
distinct
absense
of
hops
and
kinda
funky
sulphury
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
on
the
high
side
of
medium
and
carbonation
is
average
overall
i
cant
really
say
i
was
a
fan
poured
a
reddishbrown
color
with
slightly
offwhite
head
smell
is
very
attractive
with
strong
roasted
malt
notes
combined
with
nice
caramel
taste
fails
to
live
up
to
the
smell
buth
is
still
rather
enjoyable
finished
a
bit
thin
but
refreshing
could
be
a
pleasant
session
beer
d
this
beer
didnt
have
a
lot
of
flavor
and
the
flavors
it
did
have
were
a
little
off
it
would
be
nice
to
taste
some
other
malt
flavors
like
maybe
some
munich
malt
or
other
lightly
toasted
malts
opens
with
a
malty
earth
smell
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
fluffy
taste
has
a
malty
richness
and
is
nice
and
bubbly
but
there
were
some
distracting
offflavors
a
bit
of
oxidation
and
a
medicinal
phenol
character
overwhelms
the
light
hop
profile
i
think
if
i
had
another
sample
it
should
turn
out
pretty
good
clear
brownamber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
cereal
sweet
malts
toasted
caramel
and
nuts
minor
adjunct
taste
sweetish
toasted
malts
not
that
bad
though
slight
vegetal
hop
finish
but
more
adjuncty
malt
sweetness
in
the
end
light
bodied
mass
lager
feel
a
better
choice
than
michelob
amberbock
the
body
is
really
lacking
overall
this
is
very
limited
beer
with
not
much
to
it
drinkability
and
overall
although
this
was
a
completely
average
beer
for
the
most
part
its
drinkability
is
very
high
i
think
it
left
me
wanting
another
even
though
the
first
one
wasnt
all
that
enjoyable
i
found
an
interesting
quote
on
the
schell
website
regarding
dark
the
perfect
beer
for
people
who
want
a
specialty
craft
beer
but
may
not
want
all
the
flavor
and
heaviness
playing
into
the
flavor
is
a
bad
thing
mindset
is
inexcusable
for
a
brewery
that
expects
to
be
taken
seriously
schell
dark
is
light
years
away
from
schell
pale
ale
so
much
so
that
its
hard
to
believe
that
the
same
brewery
is
responsible
for
both
beers
drinkability
is
about
the
same
as
any
american
macro
you
could
drink
it
on
a
hot
day
but
would
never
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
it
not
a
great
brew
here
best
to
stick
with
schells
craft
selections
but
if
this
was
on
tap
at
some
pizza
parlor
id
go
for
it
think
root
beer
in
appearance
thats
exactly
what
it
looked
like
when
poured
head
color
root
beer
it
didnt
smell
like
root
beer
though
it
didnt
smell
much
as
all
just
a
light
musty
aroma
when
it
came
to
the
mouthfeel
however
we
were
back
to
root
beer
again
the
consistency
carbonation
it
all
had
me
rechecking
the
bottle
to
make
sure
that
i
didnt
accidentally
grab
a
say
it
with
me
root
beer
the
taste
thankfully
wasnt
root
beer
it
was
more
of
a
watery
nothing
that
quickly
disappeared
altogether
all
of
this
makes
for
a
brew
that
you
could
easily
throw
back
a
lot
of
if
you
had
nothing
better
to
drink
or
were
interested
in
being
neither
offended
nor
impressed
the
whole
experience
left
me
kind
of
ho
hum
whatever
a
distaser
and
gramps
would
be
proud
of
me
color
is
a
clear
orangish
cherrywood
color
it
could
be
darker
with
more
brown
pours
out
to
a
medium
beige
head
that
fades
quickly
no
real
lace
sticking
aroma
is
quite
sweet
and
fruity
with
dullish
apple
and
pear
a
malty
nose
touches
of
dry
nuttyness
but
it
has
a
bit
of
a
souring
smell
and
reminds
of
flat
white
wine
or
something
interestingly
off
taste
comes
across
quite
thin
and
far
to
sweet
malts
are
in
flavorful
amounts
but
not
in
a
good
way
by
any
means
very
light
and
twingy
with
a
watery
mix
of
white
wine
fruityness
and
dulled
crispness
feel
is
watery
and
thin
characterless
and
boring
boy
a
disappointing
beer
at
best
i
so
want
to
support
schells
other
brews
other
then
the
firebrick
and
pale
but
it
just
aint
happening
is
a
light
burgundy
color
with
a
little
purewhite
head
smells
malty
and
a
little
roasted
tastes
like
a
dark
lager
should
it
has
the
smooth
flavor
of
a
lager
with
a
little
bit
of
carmel
and
nut
flavor
this
was
not
expected
in
the
sampler
pack
i
was
expecting
the
schmaltzs
alt
but
this
will
do
almost
undrinkable
sorry
schell
drinkability
sorry
the
very
watered
down
flavor
and
mouthfeel
has
me
dissapointed
not
a
real
good
dunkel
usually
this
brewery
is
very
good
but
this
must
be
one
of
their
dumbed
down
beers
for
the
masses
this
beer
is
a
dark
lager
but
is
the
color
of
an
ipa
not
a
dark
beer
such
as
a
porter
nice
head
with
some
retention
nose
contains
hints
of
malt
slight
chocoate
and
caramel
the
taste
is
smooth
some
roasted
notes
mingle
here
and
there
with
the
clean
maltiness
overall
not
too
bad
a
little
thin
but
highly
drinkable
id
take
this
anyday
over
michelob
dark
this
is
the
kind
of
dark
beer
you
could
suck
a
case
down
all
day
say
if
youre
in
an
ice
shack
or
something
pours
out
to
an
amber
not
necessarily
dark
color
in
the
glass
as
with
the
other
schell
offerings
this
one
has
a
very
slight
head
little
to
no
aroma
other
than
fairly
light
malt
taste
is
predominantly
that
of
malt
with
a
slight
sweetness
comparible
to
michelob
amber
bock
crossed
with
a
killians
red
average
at
best
clear
medium
brown
in
color
little
head
and
no
lace
aroma
of
the
slightest
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
tastes
pretty
crisp
like
a
regular
lager
but
with
dark
malts
a
nice
hop
finish
this
beer
is
pretty
boring
but
the
fact
its
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
redeems
itself
a
nice
change
up
from
the
regular
macrocrap
thats
out
there
i
would
buy
and
drink
more
of
this
if
it
were
readily
available
in
my
area
a
quality
beer
from
a
small
regional
brewery
that
is
wellknown
for
their
germanstyle
lagers
clear
dark
tealike
brown
ok
head
thats
down
to
a
rimclinging
rim
in
40
seconds
slightly
chocolate
aroma
mostly
malty
but
pretty
nondescript
a
little
bit
of
a
nut
flavor
but
not
much
some
light
brown
sugar
predominates
very
little
sense
of
hops
at
the
finish
this
is
really
ordinary
in
all
aspects
not
a
beer
i
would
choose
to
purchase
on
my
own
maybe
a
starter
for
people
who
like
michelob
dark
the
bottle
was
a
part
of
a
sampler
pack
i
got
in
order
to
try
this
years
snow
storm
rendition
id
score
it
real
high
compared
to
my
choices
but
this
is
the
best
i
can
do
good
stuff
but
nothing
special
fairly
bland
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
dark
beer
for
people
want
to
drink
quantity
id
rather
stick
with
premium
strong
wheatbased
beer
thats
crisp
and
light
better
than
regular
grain
belt
thats
for
sure
more
flavor
but
still
not
a
top
tier
beer
my
old
standby
cheap
but
awesome
almost
no
head
even
when
poured
hard
but
what
a
robust
refreshing
taste
and
the
color
is
something
to
admire
almost
as
good
roomtemp
from
the
bottle
as
it
is
cold
from
a
glass
overall
decent
but
pedestrian
for
the
price
a
very
solid
beer
and
one
that
you
can
offer
to
more
timid
beer
drinkers
as
a
chance
to
have
something
with
a
bit
of
character
i
know
a
couple
guys
who
wont
drink
anything
darker
than
lemonade
who
love
this
stuff
nothing
really
great
or
good
with
this
beer
other
than
its
ease
of
drinkability
the
quintessential
amber
beer
this
beer
is
my
goto
beer
especially
for
the
price
it
is
great
all
year
round
but
especially
refreshing
in
the
summertime
i
love
it
paired
with
a
good
grillouttailgate
experience
it
is
not
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
but
is
a
tasty
reliable
beer
for
your
money
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
nordeast
isnt
the
best
tasting
beer
in
the
market
but
for
the
price
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
beers
that
can
compare
in
drinkability
and
refreshness
its
my
go
to
beer
both
in
the
winter
and
summer
and
will
continue
to
be
my
first
choice
for
reasonable
priced
beer
look
is
what
one
expects
from
amber
lager
smell
is
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
wheat
and
a
sample
of
honey
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
this
beer
can
be
drank
all
day
and
should
be
the
go
to
beer
for
any
trip
to
minnesota
especially
on
a
budget
for
the
money
i
would
generally
choose
somthing
else
pours
a
pretty
dark
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
sticky
lacing
when
sipped
not
much
of
a
smell
actually
just
some
malt
and
floral
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
upfront
but
isnt
over
done
at
all
with
a
little
dry
finish
from
the
malt
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
has
a
clean
crisp
taste
that
is
very
enjoyable
really
like
this
one
left
behind
is
a
nice
laced
mug
from
top
to
bottom
nice
minnesota
beer
o
easily
one
of
the
best
domestic
beers
of
this
style
that
ive
ever
had
this
is
not
one
of
those
craft
beers
so
i
see
why
people
would
not
go
nuts
over
something
like
this
but
at
the
same
time
i
can
see
why
it
is
so
successful
its
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
all
no
off
putting
flavors
or
bad
aftertastes
or
anything
like
this
ive
been
told
this
is
a
beer
that
is
indicative
of
the
schell
lagers
and
if
that
is
the
case
i
will
have
to
try
some
this
beer
would
satisfy
most
drinkers
in
my
opinion
but
would
be
a
real
treat
for
someone
like
myself
who
typically
drinks
domestic
beers
like
miller
or
yuengling
a
terrific
beer
o
this
is
well
brewed
beer
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
big
boring
american
light
lagers
original
comes
to
mind
refreshing
and
not
overfilling
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
and
have
kicked
back
several
liters
on
a
summer
evening
note
i
chuckled
as
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
it
is
perfectly
fine
to
drink
out
of
bottle
gasp
one
of
those
beers
where
the
total
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
hence
the
higher
overall
rating
not
really
worth
doing
a
full
a
review
but
im
just
going
say
this
is
my
preferred
drinking
beer
being
from
minnesota
this
is
easily
accessible
and
cheap
and
my
go
to
if
im
at
the
bar
and
not
feeling
adventurous
or
if
you
want
a
beer
to
give
to
guests
without
stooping
to
the
bottom
beers
tastes
decent
and
goes
down
easy
and
if
i
had
more
then
a
couple
i
wouldnt
feel
bad
about
it
for
what
it
is
its
my
ideal
beer
on
a
budget
o
merely
mediocre
its
grian
belt
premium
plus
a
bit
of
flavor
minus
a
bit
of
nostalgia
final
thoughts
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
didnt
really
think
much
of
it
its
one
of
those
beers
that
you
have
on
hand
once
in
a
while
but
doesnt
deserve
to
be
on
a
regular
rotation
in
your
fridge
however
for
the
novice
beer
drinker
nordeast
is
a
good
starting
point
if
you
want
to
get
into
darker
beers
but
fear
that
they
might
be
overwhelming
o
yum
love
this
beer
every
time
one
of
my
friends
to
mn
i
always
tell
them
to
get
me
some
of
this
its
in
the
same
league
as
other
macros
but
the
taste
is
far
superior
o
like
i
said
before
the
belt
is
an
easy
drinking
cheap
alternative
to
all
the
macro
choices
out
there
this
is
one
for
people
who
dont
want
to
be
like
every
body
else
by
far
not
the
best
beer
out
there
but
definitely
worth
a
try
sometime
drinkability
you
know
i
um
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again
unless
i
find
myself
at
one
of
those
frozen
lake
fishing
contests
where
a
handful
of
people
fish
and
everyone
else
gets
drunk
i
love
minnesota
but
schell
lagers
are
just
not
my
thing
the
beer
pours
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
doesnt
have
much
going
on
other
than
a
heavy
dose
of
grain
and
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
very
similar
with
grain
and
a
little
bit
of
fruit
which
i
cant
really
identify
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
fairly
straightforward
and
not
offensive
but
something
i
cared
too
much
for
its
ok
a
lot
of
people
love
this
beer
i
just
like
it
a
big
shout
out
to
cpolking
for
sending
this
beer
poured
from
a
clear
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
caramel
taste
is
very
refreshing
crisp
bready
some
malts
and
caramel
just
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
pours
out
a
completely
transparent
standard
amber
color
with
a
foam
collar
and
no
lacing
at
first
the
aroma
was
strictly
metallic
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
changed
into
a
grassy
hopping
on
top
of
raw
grain
aroma
tastes
of
mostly
raw
grains
and
a
bit
of
wheat
chaff
as
well
the
moniker
grain
belt
was
definitely
wellchosen
the
grassy
hopping
rises
up
and
settles
down
without
a
fuss
in
the
light
bodied
finish
that
definitely
refreshes
like
a
lawnmower
beer
not
bad
not
great
o
overall
a
decent
brew
for
the
price
point
perhaps
a
step
up
from
the
run
of
the
mill
premium
amber
in
color
with
some
garnet
highlights
that
showed
off
the
sides
of
the
glass
quite
nicely
small
white
head
was
short
lived
and
left
behind
a
broken
crown
and
only
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
bready
malts
hints
of
caramel
candied
sugar
a
touch
of
spicy
apple
at
times
but
seemed
to
be
a
little
light
to
me
warming
brought
out
a
touch
of
a
roasted
note
for
me
now
as
well
clean
feel
nicely
carbonated
albeit
a
touch
thin
for
the
style
flavor
did
not
hold
up
as
well
as
the
aroma
did
to
be
honest
i
was
really
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
one
o
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it
it
isnt
even
close
to
as
good
as
most
craft
brews
but
when
you
compare
it
to
the
bmcs
of
the
world
it
aint
so
bad
overall
a
surprise
winner
i
got
this
from
a
neighbor
who
works
at
a
distributor
he
told
me
his
favorite
beer
was
bud
light
and
i
was
a
bit
concerned
when
he
recommended
the
grain
belt
nordeast
but
man
i
definitely
trust
him
now
sweet
malty
smell
maple
syrup
and
caramel
a
touch
grainy
and
sugary
flavors
are
similar
sweet
and
malty
caramel
and
husky
toasted
grains
blend
with
an
odd
fruity
hawaiian
punch
note
not
too
far
off
from
cereals
like
froot
loops
or
fruity
pebbles
for
what
its
worth
watery
but
fairly
malty
its
merely
average
not
terrible
sort
of
a
macro
version
of
a
craft
lager
something
i
wouldnt
refuse
if
offered
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
found
this
one
in

figured
why
not
a

poured

with
a
half

to

quickly
there
was
no
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutmeg
and
subtle
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
grain
wheat
and
subtle
caramel
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
nothing
really
too
exciting
going
on
here
at
all
i
can
tell
that
they
were
aiming
for
an
amber
but
they
fell
short
with
the
hop
profiles
on
this
one
better
than
most
adjunct

that
isnt
saying

beer
this
is
a
good
lawn
mower
beer
hot
day
in
the
sun
lighter
drinker
with
some
flavor
drink
cold
though
that
adjunct
begins
to
show
with
time
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
ive
had
grain
belt
premium
and
i
think
it
tastes
like
blueberries
which
grosses
me
out
about
halfway
through
my
2nd
bottle
this
however
has
a
great
balance
of
flavor
has
just
the
right
body
for
the
heavier
maltyeast
flavor
i
recommend
at
least
trying
it
overall
the
quality
of
this
beer
does
not
match
the
local
hype
while
it
is
significantly
better
and
differentiated
from
grain
belt
premium
this
is
not
much
of
a
step
up
the
flavor
is
not
present
enough
to
call
this
a
craft
beer
its
a
pseudocraft
beer
while
it
isnt
something
that
need
be
poured
down
the
drain
i
would
not
recommend
it
to
those
who
are
looking
for
premium
craft
beer
quality
then
again
it
isnt
sold
at
a
craft
beer
price
prosit
i
looked
at
the
website
description
before
sampling
it
was
served
with
a
nice
cream
colored
to
very
light
tan
fine
head
that
slowly
subsided
to
a
ring
around
the
top
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
some
bubble
streams
color
was
a
nice
clear
medium
amber
aroma
was
beery
and
a
bit
of
malt
flavor
was
mainly
sweet
with
a
little
malt
thrown
in
body
and
carbonation
were
ok
finish
was
like
flavor
fairly
shallow
overall
the
darker
color
i
think
predisposes
one
to
think
theres
more
malt
in
here
than
there
is
didnt
really
pick
up
on
the
advertised
bitterness
not
planning
on
having
more
do
i
liked
this
one
overall
very
easy
drinking
and
smooth
may
have
liked
it
a
tad
more
than
grain
belt
premium
slightly
more
flavorful
would
be
a
great
one
to
share
with
a
bmc
person
these
go
down
nice
and
smooth
and
easy
leave
the
negro
modelo
to
collect
dust
on
the
shelf
chase
yer
burrito
with
this
instead
sans
lime
pours
with
a
thin
head
that
sticks
around
for
less
than
a
minute
almost
no
discernible
odor
what
i
can
pick
up
is
grassy
or
vegetablelike
the
taste
of
toasted
malts
and
sweet
caramel
is
very
pleasant
and
very
prominent
considering
that
it
doesnt
smell
like
anything
nordeast
seems
thick
for
its
style
its
not
something
i
would
feel
like
drinking
quickly
its
more
like
a
beer
one
would
nurse
overallamazing
how
much
better
nordeast
is
vs
grain
belts
premium
lager
the
few
times
ive
had
this
on
tap
its
been
a
little
better
cleaner
taste
with
more
robust
mouthfeel
than
in
the
bottle
a
great
alternative
to
the
large
scale
lagers
overall
better
than
premium
not
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
with
this
beer
but
more
appreciative
than
a
beer
from
the
big
3
or
is
it
big
2
now
ill
give
it
high
praise
from
a
minnesotan
not
bad
overall
there
isnt
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
but
i
kind
of
like
it
it
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
in
an
evening
good
drinkability
solid
beer
nothing
special
at
all
but
pretty
solid
d
this
is
an
okay
lager
i
understand
the
historical
lovenostalgia
for
grain
belt
and
the
nordeast
neighborhood
of
the
tc
but
this
isnt
something
ill
be
stocking
up
on
during
my
annual
trips
to
mn
dits
drinkable
with
a
lower
abv
its
great
to
knock
back
some
of
these
while
bowling
in
the
winter
its
really
just
average
this
is
a
substantial
improvement
over
grain
belt
premium
because
it
has
more
flavor
and
character
it
is
not
a
craft
beer
so
dont
expect
the
crafted
experience
my
take
is
that
if
you
want
a
routine
drinkin
beer
medium
copper
body
pinkie
finger
of

some

so
it
works
perfectly
for

definitely
not

the

this
is
a

that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
a
fine
sessionable
beer
by
a
local
brewery
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
about
on

and
tastewise
with
yuengling

with
virtually

i
am

on

lager
reminds
me
of
days
of
yore
in
riverfront
stadium
with
the
beer
guy
hocking
various
types
of
lowbrow
hudy
this
brew
is
quite
an
upgrade
from
those
days
with
a
very
tasty
mellow
lager
at
a
very
good
price
glad
to
see
it
and
its
mates
on
the
shelves
in
columbus
one
of
the
better
can
designs
ive
ever
seen
the
beer
inside
is
pale
brown
with
lots
of
carbonation
strong
aromas
of
fruit
and
cereal
hit
the
nose
quite
pleasantly
tastes
of
fruit
and
sweet
light
caramel
this
is
a
decent
lager
and
a
great
goto
brewespecially
when
you
consider
how
inexpensive
it
is
overall
ive
had
a
lot
better
but
ive
also
had
more
than
a
few
worse
i
could
deal
with
this
if
it
were
my
only
option
at
a
party
but
not
sure
id
ever
go
buy
this
for
myself
the
style
in
general
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
dont
see
where
this
is
any
worse
than
others
of
the
style
that
ive
had
notes
a
short
review
means
this
beer
wasnt
worth
more
words
tastes
sweet
carmel
malt
followed
by
a
nice
hop
cut
big
mouthfeel
that
could
border
on
syrupy
when
its
warm
this
is
not
bad
bad
beer
think
pabst
on
steroids
great
session
beer
that
can
satisfy
your
snob
tooth
really
good
for
what
it
is
i
say
nothing
to
complex
but
a
good
effort
would
love
to
find
this
on
draft
o
its
a
moderate
to
decent
beer
i
was
craving
something
light
and
easy
drinking
and
it
hit
the
spot
it
would
be
a
good
tailgating
beer
taste
is
also
toasty
slightly
sweet
certainly
richer
and
more
fullbodied
than
most
traditional
american
lagers
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
a
wonderful
middle
ground
between
lagers
and
ales
a
solid
goto
session
drink
overall
i
expected
more
alot
of
hype
with
this
brew
but
the
overwellming
sweetness
kinda
did
me
in
pretty
good
for
the
price
point
very
drinkable
at
6
49
for
a
sixer
it
would
be
a
good
fallback
beer
this
beer
surprised
me
i
had
low
expectations
but
was
pleased
to
find
it
a
very
good
beer
nothing
overly
fancy
but
a
nice
everyday
brew
slightly
thick
and
syrupy
in
the
mouth
yet
crisp
and
tart
chunky
tasting
and
overall
fairly
bland
it
finishes
with
a
touch
of
sourness
i
had
the
good
fortune
if
you
will
to
sip
on
this
right
from
the
bottle
the
last
time
my
band
played
the
southgate
house
ive
wanted
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
since
sure
its
nothing
great
but
i
dont
find
too
much
going
on
thats
terrible
deep
gold
to
medium
amber
surprisingly
corn
gristy
smell
but
there
is
a
bit
of
hidden
malty
sweetness
in
the
background
there
are
hints
of
mild
scottish
ale
in
this
it
starts
out
with
a
bit
of
that
scottish
ale
taste
it
is
rich
and
malty
with
noble
hops
dancing
in
the
background
it
finishes
with
that
corn
grist
aftertaste
typical
adjunct
amber
traditional
cincinnati
lager
nice
to
see
this
along
with
the
moerlin
line
making
a
comeback
not
the
greatest
lager
out
there
but
for
a
5
99
supermarket
sixpack
you
cant
go
wrong
not
too
bad
but
not
great
its
another
really
sweet
under
attenuated
lager
by
a
noncraft
brewery
overall
i
think
i
have
found
a
real
gem
in
that
it
is
a
beer
that
is
more
than
average
but
has
a
real
low
price
it
is
an
easy
drinker
that
will
be
nice
to
have
a
fridge
full
of
for
the
guys
in
the
neighborhood
in
the
cincinnati
area
i
would
predict
this
to
be
a
hit
not
sure
how
much
it
will
spread
side
note
hudepohl
amber
is
the
only
local
beer
currently
offered
at
us
bank
arena
in
cincinnati
also
i
saw
hudy
amber
at
the
store
packaged
in
cans
this
past
week
havent
tried
it
canned
yet
the
aroma
is
bready
and
slightly
sweet
has
just
the
right
amount
of
bite
and
is
quite
easy
to
drink
isnt
overly
filling
and
i
could
easily
drink
this
with
dinner
drinkability
this
is
quite
easy
and
refreshing
to
drink
its
mostly
average
to
me
but
its
easily
tolerable
ive
had
better
but
ive
also
had
way
worse
i
probably
wont
pick
it
up
again
but
i
would
drink
it
socially
for
sure
drinkability
despite
my
comments
about
the
smell
and
this
beer
being
just
about
average
this
is
actually
a
quite
drinkable
beer
it
goes
very
well
with
food
larosas
pizza
in
this
case
and
quenches
nicely
and
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
food
its
like
this
beer
was
designed
to
be
had
with
food
complimenting
what
is
there
but
not
getting
in
the
way
or
clashing
so
i
could
easily
have
another
but
with
food
by
itself
i
can
think
of
other
amberred
lagers
i
would
prefer
to
have
instead

very

it
wouldnt
be

to
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
for
the
style
of
beer
this
is
its
good
appearance
was
an
amber
color
but
easily
seen
thru
no
depth
to
the
color
head
was
average
and
lasted
a
short
time
my
nose
was
unable
to
detect
much
other
than
a
malty
scent
which
became
apparent
on
first
sip
overall
the
taste
was
above
average
especially
for
a
beer
at
this
price
point
mouthfeel
was
light
and
drinkability
is
high
worth
the
money
proud
to
see
hudepohl
coming
back
with
great
products
a
really
really
good
product
d
not
bad
and
definitely
sessionable
nonoffensive
and
malty
focused
the
beer
paris
well
with
a
lot
of
foods
but
as
a
standalone
its
way
too
onedimensional
for
any
high
ratings
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
at
an
affordable
price
and
a
great
local
alternative
to
the
macrobrands
had
a
few
times
straight
out
of
the
bottle
this
time
poured
into
a
pint
clear
amber
beer
with
tan
head
has
that
classic
hudy
lager
smell
only
without
adjuncts
taste
is
very
malty
good
body
extremely
drinkable
one
of
those
beers
that
is
good
from
the
bottle
during
a
tailgate
but
great
from
a
glass
at
home
my
new
goto
beer
priced
perfectly
between
cheap
and
craft
i
just
found
out
this
is
available
in
ky
and
at
5
99
a
6pk
this
will
be
my
new
session
beer
if
it
really
is
available
in
lexington
seriously
good
stuff
for
those
who
believe
this
some
marketing
bridge
between
larger
brewing
concerns
and
smaller
ones
all
i
can
say
is
this
beers
quality
and
character
speaks
for
itself
drinkability
a
pretty
decent
session
beer
to
bridge
the
macro
folk
to
the
micro
folk
a
natural
pick
for
this
years
halloween
beer
tasting
better
than
most
mass
produced
stuff
drank
from
tap
makes
a
world
of
difference
from
bottled
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
yes
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
rickards
yet
but
it
is
not
one
of
the
best
red
ale
on
the
market
o
rickards
red
one
of
the
best
brews
in
the
rickards
line
but
definitely
not
one
of
the
best
red
lagers
out
there
if
youre
looking
for
a
tasty
brew
that
is
good
with
a
steak
and
available
at
most
restaurants
in
canada
at
least
rickards
red
can
do
the
job
if
you
have
a
choice
definitely
choose
draught
over
bottle
the
bottles
have
a
weird
metallic
taste
overall
i
recommend
this
beer
o
its
fine
not
really
much
distinguishing
character
perhaps
the
macro
brew
of
amber
ales
smooth
nothing
really
standing
out
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
worth
picking
up
unless
you
can
equally
find
it
for
a
dollar
had
a
pint
on
tap
at
a
calgary
neighborhood
pub
following
another
pint
of
its
white
stable
mate
was
considering
an
attempt
at
the
whole
rickards
rainbow
but
perhaps
fortunately
there
were
only
the
two
most
common
options
this
red
lager
is
an
attractive
amber
red
hue
more
red
than
brown
and
is
highly
carbonated
as
is
so
often
the
case
with
decent
but
not
earthshatteringly
good
macrobrews
the
aroma
is
not
unpleasant
but
is
faint
and
takes
some
work
to
discern
i
get
some
caramel
red
fruit
and
some
citrus
hop
notes
against
a
toasty
malt
backbone
but
the
whole
thing
is
downplayed
taste
was
astonishingly
fruity
in
this
example
a
bright
sweet
cherry
gum
flavor
along
with
another
form
of
rounded
corny
sweetness
bramble
fruits
and
some
subdued
caramel
that
follows
the
nose
some
tangy
spice
accompanies
a
fairly
watery
body
and
a
minimally
bitter
finish
with
metallic
cardboard
and
sour
apple
notes
although
frankly
i
have
tasted
worse
faults
in
microbrewed
redamber
ales
other
examples
i
have
tried
had
a
dry
nut
character
theres
some
technical
proficiency
here
but
little
true
artistry
unless
one
deems
the
emphasis
on
fruit
and
medicinal
notes
to
be
a
unique
feature
of
this
particular
exemplar
personally
id
like
more
caramelcrystal
malt
and
hops
to
provide
balance
color
me
conservative
overall
good
offering
from
rickards
and
not
a
bad
massproduced
red
lager
however
slightly
inferior
to
its
direct
competition
being
the
offering
at
alexander
keiths
overall
not
something
im
likely
to
enjoy
regularly
but
any
trip
to
a
chain
restaurant
with
limited
beer
selection
here
in
canada
means
that
this
becomes
a
viable
option
used
to
be
my
go
to
beer
before
i
discovered
craft
beer
a
slightly
abovemediocre
beer
the
one
thing
i
like
about
it
is
that
it
is
somewhat
easy
to
find
in
common
restaurant
chains
in
the
area
something
to
fall
back
on
if
the
place
im
eating
at
doesnt
have
anything
else
better
a
good
standard
easy
drinking
red
beer
branded
as
an
irish
style
this
seems
distinctively
canadian
to
me
a
lovely
darker
copper
amber
color
with
a
tall
lacing
head
that
would
get
even
higher
marks
if
it
lasted
more
than
a
minute
or
so
a
pleasant
mix
of
malts
less
dry
irish
red
than
american
style
amber
to
me
with
a
touch
of
earthiness
a
bit
of
smoke
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
peculiar
yet
enjoyable
nutty
element
the
carbonation
is
great
tons
of
little
micro
bubbles
instantly
refreshing
me
and
getting
my
palate
ready
for
a
big
afternoon
and
evening
of
beer
consumption
here
this
is
an
all
day
beer
at
a
lower
abv
and
such
a
quick
finish
for
the
style
a
much
better
than
average
brew
here
impressive
for
a
molson
coors
offering
and
one
id
be
happy
to
drink
again
a
little
adjunct
and
metallic
on
the
finish
but
its
minor
and
doesnt
deteriorate
much
from
the
overall
experience
o
my
favourite
canadian
macro
its
a
bit
better
from
the
bottle
poured
ontap
in
a
shaker
pint
at
a
margaritaville
in
canada
the
beer
is
a
dark
ruby
red
coloring
with
no
head
but
a
filmy
ring
on
the
surface
nose
of
roasted
character
caramel
and
nut
but
all
very
subtle
flavors
of
sweet
caramel
forward
with
a
roasty
backbone
and
subtle
bitter
hops
at
the
end
crisp
and
light
in
mouth
clean
minimal
toasted
grain
aftertaste
crisp
clean
finish
typical
macrostyle
red
overall
35
like
i
said
theres
no
good
beer
out
here
you
either
get
used
to
it
or
you
put
up
some
cash
and
drive
a
lot
seriously
i
have
to
drive
25
minutes
to
get
to
an
lcbo
liquor
control
board
of
ontario
that
stocks
about
10
decent
craft
beers
that
arent
macro
produced
wannabes
for
the
real
good
stuff
i
have
to
drive
45
minutes
to
an
hour
dont
waste
your
time
with
this
beer
unless
youre
in
my
position
i
moved
from
just
outside
of
philadelphia
to
here
beer
hell
a
step
up
for
a
macro
a
bit
more
flavorful
than
say
molson
and
with
absolutely
no
off
nodes
o
easy
drinking
but
not
much
in
terms
of
flavour
reminiscent
of
a
molson
canadian
with
red
food
colouring
pours
a
clear
brown
color
12
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
hop
and
slight
ricecorn
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
hop
and
slight
ricecorn
overall
good
appearance
but
aroma
blend
and
body
are
lacking
o
too
sweet
not
enough
hops
and
a
thin
mouth
feel
makes
this
a
forgettable
brew
pours
a
clean
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
sweet
roast
but
quite
faint
in
the
taste
a
bit
sweet
in
the
malt
that
has
a
small
caramel
like
roast
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
lightly
dry
and
sweet
roast
in
the
aftertaste
an
easy
ale
to
drink
a
bit
sweet
and
it
lacks
aroma
avoid
the
smell
is
sour
and
metallic
overall
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
go
too
but
it
is
superior
to
dark
horse
and
most
likely
over
labatt
blue
341ml
bottle
pours
a
hazy
dirty
copper
color
with
no
head
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
caramel
malts
earth
and
a
bit
sour
the
taste
is
mostly
of
the
malts
some
sweet
caramel
along
with
a
little
sourness
earthy
not
all
that
flavorful
thin
mouthfeel
it
nothing
special
overall
i
dont
need
to
have
it
again
overall
a
good
sessionable
brew
decent
flavor
but
you
really
have
to
love
rice
overall
it
is
not
a
complex
beer
but
its
simplicity
is
what
makes
it
so
generically
good
the
aroma
is
this
beers
weakest
point
but
it
is
very
drinkable
often
the
best
product
available
in
a
molsonsponsored
bar
and
ive
quaffed
a
lot
of
it
in
the
past
but
never
something
id
choose
otherwise
and
i
wont
be
returning
to
this
place
soon
overall
was
over
at
a
friends
house
and
wasnt
going
to
turn
this
beer
down
even
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
at
least
its
a
step
in
the
right
direction
from
most
of
the
other
boring
macros
out
there
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
fairly
bland
flavours
and
aromas
on
tap
at
swiss
chalet
in
toronto
pours
amber
with
a
thick
long
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
of
fermented
dough
and
not
much
else
medium
tangy
body
taste
is
of
very
unpleasant
sour
dough
i
do
not
know
how
is
it
possible
to
spoil
the
beer
like
that
fine
for
having
at
a
bbq
but
pretty
mediocre
overall
i
guess
the
color
was
amber
but
there
wasnt
much
else
about
it
that
was
to
style
it
was
more
like
a
killians
than
anything
else
maybe
a
little
extra
maltiness
but
otherwise
just
a
light
aroma
low
taste
beer
that
was
very
unmemorable
it
wasnt
worth
the
calories
so
i
left
twothirds
behind
overall
this
beer
is
readily
available
and
is
a
good
alternative
the
coorscanadianblue
options
for
widely
found
canadian
macrobeers
o
not
a
great
start
canada
this
was
not
a
pleasant
experience
and
its
not
because
theres
some
huge
offense
offtaste
or
a
striking
flaw
it
just
wasnt
satisfying
or
flavorful
in
any
way
too
bad
but
it
hasnt
shaken
my
confidence
that
ill
find
some
good
brews
in
ontario
im
still
on
the
hunt
pours
a
caramel
amber
color
with
a
hint
of
red
and
an
inch
high
fluffly
head
that
slowly
recedes
low
aroma
of
toffee
and
butterscotch
flavors
of
toasted
malt
some
grainy
cinnamon
and
caramel
finishes
a
bit
buttery
full
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
not
sure
why
this
one
gets
slammed
so
much
may
not
be
world
class
but
not
a
bad
beer
particularly
from
such
a
large
producer
was
able
to
taste
rickards
red
at
the
keg
restaurant
in
calgary
this
was
a
decent
beer
produced
by
a
marcobrewery
the
appearance
was
a
ruby
red
with
foamy
white
head
the
smell
was
not
overly
impressive
but
most
red
ales
arent
there
was
some
malt
and
subtle
hop
to
the
nose
the
taste
was
very
smooth
with
nice
malt
character
that
was
well
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
good
and
would
be
a
good
selection
for
a
session
beer
d
lacks
a
bit
in
the
flavor
department
and
could
have
used
some
more
malt
to
put
it
over
the
top
nothing
offensive
just
pretty
generic
overalla
decent
red
i
can
think
of
better
ones
but
this
was
ok
to
have
in
canada
and
went
well
with
my
fajitas
cheers
serving
style
bottle
drink
is
good
though
light
beer
light
flavors
goes
down
easy
with
no
real
off
flavors
just
not
a
lot
of
flavors
d
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
a
great
choice
when
youre
somewhere
that
basically
only
has
a
macro
selection
its
also
quite
drinkable
and
i
could
have
a
bunch
of
them
faced
with
a
lineup
of
some
of
canadas
less
exciting
beers
i
decided
to
take
the
plunge
on
rickards
red
i
was
not
disappointed
the
pour
had
a
nice
ruby
appearance
and
a
thin
head
there
are
perceptible
hops
in
the
nose
although
nothing
too
shocking
the
taste
has
the
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
you
want
from
a
red
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
while
others
pounded
their
labatts
and
not
be
unhappy
pours
a
nice
light
red
with
beige
head
that
stays
for
a
while
and
it
has
pretty
good
lacing
smells
like
slightly
roasted
grains
and
tastes
wet
but
has
decent
flavour
carbonation
is
good
very
easy
drinking
and
its
not
overly
strong
taste
makes
it
good
for
a
nice
session
beer
overall
pretty
good
beer
not
at
all
bad
the
rickards
seem
to
be
better
than
molson
in
average
the
name
certainly
isnt
a
lie
this
poured
a
clear
medium
red
with
a
short
cap
of
beige
foam
lots
of
lacing
very
sticky
with
good
head
retention
strange
aroma
i
get
lots
of
fruitiness
not
quite
citrus
with
some
grainy
malt
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
same
in
the
flavour
just
with
mild
bitterness
added
light
iron
character
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
quite
dry
and
nearly
astringent
not
bad
if
youre
stuck
somewhere
with
only
macro
taps
but
certainly
not
something
id
seek
out
or
choose
over
nearly
any
craft
offering
d
good
choose
when
at
a
pub
that
serves
mostly
macros
cheers
ahhh
rickards
red
picked
up
as
part
of
a
canadian
beer
haul
by
the
little
lady
the
last
time
i
had
this
i
was
20
years
old
and
on
a
snowboarding
trip
at
mont
tremblant
it
didnt
seem
too
bad
back
then
my
how
the
times
have
changed
poured
into
my
camp
cup
while
camping
in
the
pisgah
national
forest
a
clear
copper
red
with
a
thin
effervescent
head
looks
refreshing
at
least
smell
hmmm
what
smell
just
malty
sugar
taste
is
more
of
the
same
a
light
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
pretty
much
nothing
else
no
bitterness
hops
or
bite
on
any
level
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
drinkable
in
the
realm
of
thirst
quenchers
but
the
sweetness
would
probably
do
you
in
after
a
couple
kinda
disappointed
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
at
a
golf
course
im
stuck
behind
the
group
in
front
of
me
at
the
11st
tee
and
they
are
taking
forever
pours
a
dark
amber
colour
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
lots
of
sweetness
in
the
smell
very
malty
flavour
has
lots
of
caramel
without
much
bitterness
at
all
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
an
everyday
beer
when
i
was
still
in
high
school
this
was
my
favourite
beer
and
it
is
my
go
to
when
the
selection
sucks
but
dont
confuse
it
for
a
good
beer
of
course
it
had
a
nice
red
color
with
just
a
bit
of
head
it
didnt
have
much
of
a
smell
all
the
mouth
was
a
bit
watery
the
taste
wasnt
bad
at
all
a
light
sweet
malty
taste
not
what
i
would
normally
drink
but
it
was
the
best
of
my
3
options
used
to
be
one
of
my
favourites
a
few
years
ago
but
now
i
just
view
it
as
an
average
brew
rickards
red
poured
an
amber
color
there
was
almost
no
smell
to
it
at
all
it
had
a
bit
of
a
flavorfull
taste
but
still
weak
and
watered
down
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
realitivly
light
overall
like
most
of
the
rickards
beers
its
not
really
that
good
but
its
not
really
that
bad
either
d
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
but
i
would
not
have
even
bought
this
pint
had
there
been
some
better
craft
options
overall
a
very
average
beer
rickards
red
pours
a
medium
red
amer
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
sweet
just
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
there
is
some
dark
malt
in
the
flavor
and
a
bit
of
crystal
sweetness
but
the
finish
is
dry
and
grainy
with
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
overall
the
beer
tastes
like
a
decent
macro
ale
with
some
chocolate
malt
thrown
in
for
color
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
bit
fizzy
for
a
macro
that
is
found
everywhere
its
not
too
bad
it
has
no
distinguishing
features
its
just
beer
not
bad
of
a
beer
if
your
sitting
around
with
buddies
watching
a
game
drinkability
id
say
this
is
of
mediocre
drinkability
basically
refreshing
but
not
something
i
feel
like
pounding
on
for
6
hours
the
papa
bear
of
a
string
of
unimaginative
bland
beers
on
the
positive
side
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
fairly
popular
in
canada
might
suggest
that
there
are
more
people
out
there
that
want
more
than
the
basic
buckabeer
experience
i
bought
12
pack
with
the
redwhite
and
the
new
rickards
dark
for
14
wich
is
alright
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
thin
with
a
slight
metallic
taste
drinkability
is
average
a
good
lawnmower
beer
acceptable
session
beer
with
food
very
average
i
will
not
try
this
again
dont
say
no
when
passed
one
but
dont
go
out
of
this
way
for
this
one
after
pouring
it
i
thought
i
was
in
for
a
treat
but
after
drinking
it
i
know
i
was
tricked
and
its
not
as
good
as
it
looks
drinkability
one
is
enough
and
even
that
one
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
the
bitter
parts
were
too
bitter
and
unflavorful
the
beer
just
is
kinda
there
d
average
beer
that
i
wouldnt
order
again
there
are
much
better
canadian
reds
out
there
thin
slick
carbonation
is
really
noticeable
at
least
it
goes
down
easy
cold
i
think
ill
try
to
finish
this
before
it
warms
pours
with
a
very
small
diminishing
head
with
fair
lacing
body
is
extremely
clear
with
no
particles
with
a
nice
reddish
color
aroma
is
very
light
and
doesnt
yield
much
to
my
nose
anyway
average
carbonation
with
a
light
body
and
thin
texture
and
a
bitter
finish
the
flavor
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
after
finishing
moderately
bitter
and
lightly
acidic
overall
not
the
best
beer
but
far
from
the
worst
either
crisp
yet
bitter
its
a
fairly
good
beer
to
sip
on
regardless
of
the
season
the
clean
finish
makes
this
one
a
bit
drinkable
but
i
cant
say
ill
request
it
again
well
given
this
reacquaintance
with
molson
for
posterity
i
say
to
myself
i
think
my
friend
was
right
this
sure
tastes
like
their
flagship
middlingtolow
lager
all
dressed
up
with
a
fair
dose
of
caramel
flavoring
ok
when
the
options
at
the
bar
are
limited
but
nostalgia
aside
nothing
at
all
here
to
get
excited
about
either
d
this
is
where
rickards
scores
high
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
very
drinkable
if
not
served
too
cold
as
far
as
molson
products
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
its
a
good
session
beer
flavorful
enough
to
let
you
know
youre
drinking
beer
but
rather
light
and
not
too
filling
it
pours
a
modest
head
atop
a
nice
orangish
red
malty
liquid
the
nose
is
light
as
is
the
palate
the
palate
boasts
slight
sweetish
maltiness
with
little
bitterness
to
finish
smooth
unremarkable
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
standard
in
ontario
pubs
and
restaurants
certainly
its
worth
a
drink
during
the
short
warm
canadian
summers
d
nice
for
style
good
sessionability
a
nice
surprise
from
molson
i
would
have
this
one
again
a
nice
quenchthirster
the
caramelred
character
is
pretty
good
and
nothing
particularly
off
a
fine
attempt
for
a
macro
brewery
that
sweet
finish
doesnt
beg
another
sip
right
away
but
the
appealing
taste
keeps
you
coming
back
overall
not
a
memorable
experience
macroesque
to
be
sure
poured
a
mahogany
brown
with
about
an
inch
of
foam
which
stuck
to
the
glass
the
brew
had
a
faint
aroma
of
toast
flavor
was
mostly
toasted
malt
with
a
slight
note
of
tea
and
maybe
some
piney
hops
if
you
concentrate
real
hard
not
a
lot
of
complexity
to
a
pretty
standard
straightforward
red
which
is
nice
easy
drinking
beer
and
otherwise
not
particularly
special
had
this
one
on
tap
in
calgary
not
much
for
appearance
a
little
on
the
red
side
and
very
little
head
smelled
of
sweet
malts
and
a
little
hops
a
crisp
taste
that
was
ok
with
your
tongue
feeling
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
i
had
a
couple
more
because
the
drinkability
was
fair
from
a
limited
dated
journal
deep
bronze
in
color
distinct
malty
aroma
with
a
bready
character
a
wave
of
sweetness
at
first
with
a
long
biscuity
tangy
finish
nice
yeast
character
which
i
dont
mind
the
beer
of
choice
for
my
pei
friends
though
im
not
sure
why
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
franky
pretty
good
overall
poured
into
a
23
oz
pint
from
tap
nice
ambercranberry
color
pretty
translucent
offwhite
head
about
a
finger
which
slowly
dissipated
nose
is
faint
maybe
a
bready
malt
tough
to
pull
out
taste
has
a
generic
muted
hop
taste
with
hints
of
nuts
and
a
bit
of
sourness
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
and
watery
not
much
carb
goes
down
quite
easy
so
one
could
drink
a
few
if
they
didnt
mind
the
drab
taste
pretty
run
of
the
mill
beer
not
really
true
to
a
red
other
than
its
color
as
it
lacks
any
maltiness
really
ok
the
smell
is
pretty
faint
i
get
some
fruitiness
malt
and
some
light
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
disapointing
after
looking
at
the
beer
in
front
of
you
subtle
hop
bitterness
and
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
well
balanced
watery
mouthfeel
no
question
that
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
its
way
overpriced
drinkability
i
have
found
this
beer
to
be
refreshing
on
many
of
a
hot
summer
day
in
ontario
this
is
good
in
a
pinch
but
still
a
little
to
macro
for
me
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
red
highlights
and
little
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
the
scent
is
nice
but
uncomplicated
some
malts
and
perhaps
a
little
caramel
the
taste
is
mostly
bready
malt
with
some
caramel
and
little
to
no
hop
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
with
significantly
less
carbonation
than
youd
expect
from
a
macro
id
consider
this
a
tasty
little
beer
that
wouldnt
be
too
bad
to
pick
up
for
the
next
hockey
game
or
curling
match
a
little
bit
of
a
singlenote
brew
but
that
note
aint
too
bad
sampled
with
my
girlfriend
at
a
café
overlooking
niagara
falls
off
the
tap
the
glass
was
topped
with
a
cream
colored
head
and
the
beer
itself
was
a
clear
redamber
it
laced
very
well
but
displayed
little
retention
aromas
were
understated
earthy
and
malty
flavors
were
muted
as
well
a
nuttiness
some
breadiness
hoppy
bitterness
was
a
little
heavy
handed
and
it
didnt
have
enough
malt
to
balance
medium
carbonation
but
the
body
was
watery
it
didnt
really
strike
me
as
a
true
red
except
for
the
color
and
its
just
another
macrobrew
in
my
opinion
i
remember
this
beer
being
a
lot
better
out
of
the
bottle
but
maybe
because
that
was
a
long
time
ago
d
i
have
enjoyed
a
schooner
or
two
of
this
in
a
sitting
before
and
even
though
it
isnt
the
lightest
beer
out
there
its
great
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
a
rich
flavor
but
still
retaining
that
refreshing
aspect
goes
great
with
chicken
wings
btw
i
recommend
this
for
anyone
who
is
graduating
from
cheap
run
of
the
mill
brews
to
something
with
a
little
more
class
definately
the
best
of
the
rickards
family
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
beer
to
make
it
worth
buying
again
very
nonoffensive
red
ale
that
was
brewed
for
the
masses
of
people
who
are
affraid
to
try
new
beers
this
is
a
beer
youd
sample
in
your
introduction
to
beer
100
class
a
halfeffort
put
into
the
style
to
bring
in
the
masses
and
not
scare
away
the
veterans
decent
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
this
product
was
made
by
molson
drinkability
is
fine
good
when
you
want
to
concentrate
on
the
sens
beating
the
snot
out
of
the
leafs
instead
of
your
beer
d
i
was
surprised
to
read
the
label
and
see
that
this
is
a
molson
product
the
flavor
is
good
but
not
great
a
decent
session
beer
if
you
dont
want
something
overwhelming
poured
clear
amber
but
with
cherry
highlights

went
a
little
flat
by
the
end
but
the
lacing
held
up
throughout
clean
caramely
malty
syrupy
sweet
smell
that
tastes
quite
refreshing
and
sweet
with
caramel
hints
as
it
goes
downmedium
body
mouthfeel
and
flavorquite
a
refreshing
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
do
stock
up
often
with
this
if
you
havnt
tried
this
its
definately
worth
trying
quite
enjoyable
a
nice
beer
with
a
modicum
of
flavour
the
colour
is
dark
redbrown
which
looks
very
thick
and
the
head
varies
the
aroma
is
nondescript
compared
to
other
beers
there
are
some
slight
malt
and
hop
tinges
nothing
overpowering
it
has
a
lagery
feel
in
the
mouth
which
for
me
makes
it
a
bit
more
palatable
the
taste
is
a
slightly
sweet
taste
with
a
hint
of
malt
it
tends
to
be
a
smooth
brew
which
goes
down
quite
well
i
have
recommended
this
to
others
summary
a
wellcrafted
smooth
and
greatlooking
brew
although
by
no
means
offensive
in
taste
its
good
looks
belie
its
simplicity
in
flavor
nothing
special
but
at
the
same
time
good
at
what
it
does
this
seemed
to
be
the
most
popular
canadian
beer
i
came
across
on
the
trip
since
it
wasnt
a
macro
lager
i
was
hoping
perhaps
this
would
be
the
sam
adams
of
canada
but
that
mark
fell
a
little
short
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
doesnt
have
anything
really
too
special
going
for
it
i
guess
if
you
want
a
solid
smooth
session
beer
its
ok
but
if
you
have
better
options
id
go
with
them
pours
a
fairly
dark
amber
color
with
a
niceinch
of
white
ehad
and
a
surprising
amount
of
lacing
nose
is
mild
matl
and
grainsmells
like
your
standard
lager
taste
is
very
refreshing
mostly
malt
some
light
spices
very
light
hops
at
the
end
slight
astringency
but
not
bad
feel
is
fairly
thin
bodied
wiht
solid
carbonation
its
solid
macro
lager
that
for
some
reason
is
claiming
to
be
an
american
amber
ale
seriously
this
makes
no
sense
to
me
its
essentially
a
canadian
killians
its
refreshing
and
smooth
a
good
one
to
throw
back
a
bunch
of
final
statement
i
would
not
say
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
its
ok
for
what
it
is
its
an
attempt
at
molson
to
brew
a
beer
that
people
with
taste
buds
can
tolerate
when
theyre
are
faced
a
with
limited
selection
however
its
still
not
to
be
classified
as
a
good
beer
pint
of
glory
i
think
not
final
grade
2
97
a
forgettable
c
i
first
tried
rickards
red
very
early
on
in
my
beerdrinking
career
which
is
probably
why
i
liked
it
so
much
at
the
time
scrutinizing
it
today
after
many
years
of
being
a
ba
i
can
confidently
say
that
its
definitely
nothing
special
and
a
mediocre
sessionable
amber
at
best
id
probably
still
take
a
rickards
red
over
a
keiths
red
amber
but
i
cant
think
of
any
ocb
ambers
that
i
wouldnt
pick
well
before
either
of
them
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
beer
goes
down
very
easy
not
a
very
interesting
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
try
this
one
again
looks
and
smells
alright
but
the
taste
seems
a
bit
off
its
bland
and
comes
with
some
unsavory
flavors
its
probably
about
average
for
the
style
try
it
for
yourself
unremarkable
taste
balanced
malts
and
hops
toffee
flavous
with
enough
of
a
hop
presence
to
stop
this
from
being
too
sweet
or
caramely
smooth
mouthfeel
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
great
as
a
session
ale
round
after
round
and
you
dont
get
tired
of
it
of
course
when
selection
is
limited
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
can
easily
enjoy
this
brew
and
will
probably
put
down
a
few
today
watching
u
of
m
beat
up
on
notre
dame
this
is
the
beer
i
usually
order
when
my
only
choices
are
molson
and
labatt
products
this
is
fairly
often
as
it
is
often
the
best
choice
on
tap
in
standard
restaurants
with
limited
beer
lists
by
far
the
best
molson
brew
ive
had
to
date
i
even
let
mine
warm
up
as
i
was
enjoying
a
book
at
the
time
no
harsh
off
flavors
smooth
drinking
clean
fun
would
highly
recommended
the
best
out
of
the
rickards
series
and
one
of
the
best
mainstream
canadian
beers
d
definitely
easydrinking
drinkability
is
stellar
i
could
and
have
enjoyed
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
at
5
20
abv
its
perhaps
not
the
best
choice
as
a
session
beer
but
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
nonetheless
and
a
treat
for
the
mouth
after
far
too
much
macro
sludge
big
name
aside
you
do
have
to
reluctantly
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
rickards
red
is
a
solid
enjoyable
brew
better
on
draught
certainly
but
still
good
bottled
even
bars
that
only
tend
to
carry
lowestcommon
denominator
beer
seem
to
have
this
one
on
tap
so
it
is
and
will
continue
to
be
as
long
im
forced
by
friends
to
frequent
those
establishments
a
brew
i
enjoy
regularly
pours
to
a
very
pretty
reddishbrown
color
with
a
practically
nonexistant
head
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
it
has
been
sitting
in
a
pitcher
smell
is
quite
nice
rather
nutty
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
that
same
nutty
aroma
is
there
which
makes
it
really
easy
to
put
back
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
not
very
pronounced
carbonation
isnt
very
obvious
overall
not
bad
looking
forward
to
putting
back
a
few
more
come
the
next
time
i
go
home
the
head
is
thick
dense
creamy
faintly
creamcolored
nice
psycho
sticky
lacing
the
beer
is
a
clear
darkish
copperbrown
aroma
is
sugary
with
cooked
caramel
kinda
fruity
front
is
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
middle
is
fairly
full
sweet
fruity
with
caramel
very
nutty
in
the
end
with
loads
of
sweet
grapes
great
nutty
aftertaste
not
much
hops
to
speak
of
but
its
a
decent
red
nice
and
nutty
if
a
little
to
grapey
sweet
but
i
still
like
this
beer
this
really
isnt
that
good
its
just
a
macro
is
disguise
in
fact
there
are
a
few
macro
lagers
that
id
rather
have
than
drink
this
again
im
thinking
that
they
actually
use
copper
to
colour
this
stuff
because
there
is
this
lingering
metallic
quality
to
it
thats
what
ruins
this
beer
for
me
the
metal
makes
it
feel
funny
like
youre
sucking
a
penny
drinkability
another
good
highly
drinkable
beer
that
is
a
better
alternative
than
the
macros
id
drink
it
again
if
i
had
the
chance
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
place
in
niagara
falls
everything
about
this
beer
was
good
but
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
bit
watery
what
i
really
loved
was
the
unique
flavor
it
was
a
bit
nutty
which
was
what
really
stood
out
to
me
if
i
ever
visit
canada
again
ill
have
to
bring
home
a
case
of
this
of
the
rickards
beers
ive
had
this
is
my
favorite
by
far
i
really
love
the
colour
of
this
one
nice
deep
red
although
i
must
admit
my
experience
with
red
ales
is
limited
head
sticks
to
the
glass
for
most
of
the
pint
smell
is
faintly
sweet
hoppy
taste
starts
out
a
bit
sweet
then
goes
on
to
a
grapefruity
sour
alcohol
is
fairly
prevalent
even
though
this
isnt
that
strong
of
a
beer
finish
is
fairly
clean
but
slightly
bitter
this
beer
starts
with
a
slight
tangy
carbonated
feel
but
weakens
quite
quickly
and
ends
up
being
quite
soft
and
smooth
on
the
way
down
i
like
this
for
a
session
beer
and
for
a
macro
its
quite
acceptable
not
a
bad
beer
but
lackluster
poured
a
rather
anemic
red
for
the
style
little
aroma
a
bit
of
malt
flavor
was
rather
monotone
with
some
mildly
applefruit
malt
that
hinted
at
some
raw
grain
hopping
perked
up
a
bit
toward
the
end
and
helped
redeem
the
experience
verdict
soso
drinkability
average
i
dont
like
the
way
this
brand
is
marketed
we
know
rickards
is
molson
but
i
dont
like
having
to
pay
higher
prices
for
a
domestic
macro

me
a

this
is
definately
not
ale
very
pleasant
and
probably
one
of
the
best
mega
brews
in
canada
in
the
end
rickards
red
hasnt
changed
much
since
i
first
tried
it
except
a
lone
pint
of
it
wont
get
me
all
wigged
out
anymore
thanks
for
abstaining
with
the
use
of
that
nasty
mystery
additive
whatever
it
was
but
more
than
ever
now
that
im
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
is
it
apparent
to
me
that
it
tastes
just
like
a
coppery
version
of
molson
canadian
perhaps
with
a
bit
more
corn
for
that
added
sweetness
i
notice
the
label
only
says
its
a
red
beer
not
an
ale
busted
nice
dark
amber
body
and
off
white
head
the
smell
is
very
yeasty
kind
of
spicy
yeast
taste
is
light
overall
medium
roasted
malt
major
yeast
little
hops
charactor
mouth
feel
is
bubbly
and
watery
drinkability
is
easy
and
unoffensive
an
average
red
nothing
special
except
more
that
average
maltyness
thx
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
long
lasting
little
head
the
aroma
was
a
boring
mish
mash
of
indolent
malts
and
soapy
corn
the
taste
while
inoffensive
lacked
definition
it
consisted
of
some
bland
malts
minute
hop
bitterness
and
some
wet
cardboard
and
soapy
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
prickly
from
high
carbonation
this
beer
is
average
at
best
its
not
much
better
than
your
average
macro
swill
it
does
look
prettier
though
this
is
a
very
generic
red
ale
it
does
have
the
color
you
would
expect
in
a
classic
red
ale
it
is
not
offensive
but
really
has
no
character
or
anything
special
there
is
a
caramel
taste
but
not
much
sweetness
or
hoppiness
to
it
it
is
lighter
in
taste
and
body
than
some
other
ales
which
makes
is
easy
drinking
pretty
average
for
this
style
a
bit
better
coming
from
a
national
brewer
a
pretty
boring
beer
overall
a
let
down
for
me
its
definitely
along
the
same
lines
of
killians
red
or
michelob
amber
bock
a
slightly
malty
beer
with
a
modest
hop
profile
this
one
is
apparently
an
ale
but
its
almost
devoid
of
esters
or
diacetyl
very
clean
lagerish
finish
overall
a
pretty
decent
macro
beer
wont
blow
you
away
but
is
very
drinkable
and
inoffensive
sampled
8404
at
bugsys
in
st
catharines
this
beer
was
read
with
a
quickly
receding
head
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
it
smells
slightly
of
yeast
but
other
than
that
there
is
no
real
aroma
to
speak
of
an
adjuncty
taste
dominates
and
is
just
kinda
of
a
foul
taste
over
all
i
had
this
beer
sitting
outside
at
a
restaurant
and
it
did
quench
my
thirst
and
it
is
relatively
drinkable
in
the
right
circumstance
this
brew
pours
a
ruby
amber
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
is
gone
in
an
instant
smell
is
rather
sweet
with
malts
dominating
the
nose
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
with
very
weak
underlying
hops
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
lousy
moderatly
carbonated
drinkabilty
is
ok
i
saw
this
swill
at
most
bars
in
niagra
falls
it
was
always
mentioned
when
i
asked
for
a
draft
list
not
the
wost
canadian
i
ever
had
but
certainly
not
the
best
this
beer
is
what
i
consider
canadas
version
of
killians
but
this
i
like
better
deep
red
color
short
lived
head
and
a
really
good
flavor
hints
of
corn
and
barely
and
a
really
smooth
aftertaste
kind
of
sweet
but
not
like
candy
more
or
less
a
touch
of
sugary
taste
that
is
just
barely
enough
to
notice
this
is
one
of
the
beers
i
wish
we
had
in
the
states
worth
a
try
if
you
like
red
ales
and
are
visiting
the
great
white
north
recommended
taste
was
quite
one
dimensional
lacked
any
sort
of
depth
some
malty
sweetness
together
with
a
touch
of
grain
and
some
bitterness
all
at
once
after
a
while
you
fail
to
get
any
sort
of
taste
from
this
beer
poured
a
clear
dull
goldenred
in
color
with
a
sparse
offwhite
head
that
held
up
well
and
even
laced
the
glass
aromas
are
malty
sweet
with
just
a
dash
of
bitter
hops
in
the
background
flavors
are
average
a
slightly
roasted
nutty
flavor
mixed
in
with
a
caramel
sweetness
on
the
front
side
that
finished
with
a
slight
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
and
this
was
one
i
didnt
find
myself
reaching
for
to
finish
a
molson
product
so
whatd
you
expect
i
dont
care
i
like
this
beer
i
first
had
it
on
draft
at
the
hotel
we
always
stay
in
in
montreal
and
i
was
just
amazed
at
how
pleasant
and
easy
it
was
to
drink
the
taste
is
there
and
you
can
keep
on
drinking
them
last
had
on
draft
in
april
in
montreal
clear
irish
setter
red
when
served
came
topped
with
a
nice
white
frothy
head
clean
aroma
great
medium
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
its
mostly
all
malt
with
a
biscuity
aftertaste
i
guess
this
could
be
my
favorite
macro
i
would
not
turn
this
beer
down
since
ive
been
known
to
have
many
in
a
row
it
gets
a
5
for
drinkability
molsons
poster
child
of
craft
brewing
better
than
water
possibly
drinkable
ok
red
color
bit
of
malt
taste
but
not
much
taste
thereafter
grainy
tiny
hops
but
carbonation
bitter
astringent
aftertaste
medium
mouthfeel
a
lot
of
creamy
head
disapearing
like
soap
in
sink
tap
clear
dark
brown
colored
beer
with
absolutely
no
head
or
carbonation
aroma
is
very
neutral
with
small
traces
of
malts
taste
is
also
very
neutral
with
traces
of
malts
just
another
macro
beer
with
no
taste
whatsoever
very
boring
beer
from
molson
more
of
a
dirty
brown
than
red
still
it
looked
nice
after
the
experiment
gone
awry
that
was
a
molson
canadian
looking
forward
to
this
after
that
the
disappointment
was
immediate
thin
thin
thin
i
think
this
is
the
most
watery
beer
that
wasnt
yellowclear
ive
ever
had
nothing
happening
in
the
aroma
a
funny
metallic
taste
and
the
only
good
thin
about
the
finish
is
when
i
was
finished
with
it
to
its
credit
the
beer
was
fresh
and
adjuncts
were
not
detected
just
way
too
thin
and
too
funny
tasting
nose
was
limited
caromelfruits
no
linger
there
either
pours
out
a
dark
amber
colour
the
head
disappears
leaving
no
trace
nose
is
a
kind
of
maize
smell
sort
of
maybe
i
just
couldnt
tell
i
drank
it
but
it
was
not
what
i
think
of
as
a
good
tasting
amberred
i
might
have
to
try
it
again
and
see
if
i
missed
something
spent
an
extremely
pleasant
afternoon
in
a
pub
in
victoria
bc
drinking
this
beer
so
my
rating
may
be
a
little
biased
medium
red
color
roasted
malts
slightly
hoppy
very
flavorful
ale
refreshing
and
slightly
hoppy
good
malthop
balance
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
at
a
recent
tasting
with
a
few
friends
rickards
red
was
at
the
top
of
the
list
along
with
a
local
new
brunswick
beer
called
alpine
at
this
tasting
we
learned
not
to
mix
too
many
types
of
beers
together
as
the
drinkabiltity
of
lighter
tasting
beers
such
as
corona
and
budweiser
were
very
negatively
affected
by
the
stronger
tasting
ones
such
as
rickards
this
was
in
niagara
falls
so
getting
it
in
columbus
ohio
is
only
unlikely
i
can
live
with
out
it
though
color
is
a
solid
red
amber
deep
and
glowing
with
a
small
offwhite
head
of
tight
foam
that
faded
leaving
minimum
lacing
smell
is
very
faint
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
thats
about
it
taste
is
lighter
then
expected
mostly
sweetness
from
caramel
malts
a
bit
of
hops
but
is
uneven
a
bit
towards
the
finish
nice
effort
but
still
watered
down
enough
for
less
taste
and
easier
drinkin
upon
closer
inspection
i
see
its
a
molson
product
that
explained
alot
i
went
out
of
my
way
a
bit
while
traveling
in
sault
ste
marieontario
to
find
this
stuff
and
was
pretty
disappointed
oh
well
no
harm
done
it
was
in
canadian
exchange
so
it
was
pretty
cheap
good
appearance
for
a
macro
almost
fools
you
deep
red
colour
with
a
1
finger
head
that
lasts
weak
smell
mildly
sweet
and
spicy
if
the
smell
was
more
prominent
a
higher
score
would
be
deserved
what
i
did
smell
was
good
but
too
weak
fairly
good
taste
sweet
and
malty
with
a
little
floral
hops
not
enough
to
balance
perfectly
but
enough
hops
to
let
you
know
an
attempt
was
made
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
a
very
good
beer
considering
the
sourcemolson
overall
a
decent
red
ale
but
just
decent
nothing
remarkable
here
but
not
bad
its
certainly
better
than
your
average
hotel
bar
beer
an
alright
beer
from
a
macro
well
i
think
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
it
appears
an
amber
slightly
copper
brown
haze
over
it
with
a
highly
carbonated
white
creamy
textured
head
it
smells
of
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
there
is
really
no
dominate
hop
character
present
here
the
flavors
are
a
nutty
caramel
slightly
dry
finish
that
is
overall
very
sweet
and
drinkable
nothing
amazing
here
but
very
good
session
brew
available
only
in
canada
so
between
the
tap
version
and
the
bottle
version
a
reasonable
go
to
while
looking
for
a
better
selection
lighter
to
medium
body
with
a
lighter
watery
texture
that
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
overall
a
good
beer
for
nights
of
pleasurable
drinking
tried
this
brew
at
the
mondial
de
la
biére
in
montreal
this
past
summer
a
very
light
tasting
red
likened
to
a
milder
version
of
killians
or
sheas
wow
beautiful
amber
colour
matched
with
a
beautiful
amber
taste
lovely
would
recommend
one
of
my
goto
beers
for
when
people
come
over
pours
a
nice
deep
yellow
almost
orange
with
a
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
nice
balance
of
hop
and
malt
with
some
light
caramel
scents
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
with
the
malt
in
the
beginning
and
then
a
finish
of
clean
hops
very
refreshing
and
a
great
beer
for
any
time
of
year
this
was
a
simply
astounding
lager
exquisite
and
deelish
x
brooklyn
lager
is
a
dark
amber
colored
lager
topped
with
a
creamy
head
and
outstanding
retention
the
aroma
is
clean
brings
quick
citric
and
toffee
aromas
to
smell
with
a
taste
i
learned
how
brooklyn
brewery
got
its
groove
this
lager
is
not
only
with
flavor
but
is
clean
light
and
easy
drinking
highlighting
the
tasting
notes
are
graham
cracker
light
fruits
and
citrus
the
beer
is
balanced
as
well
if
i
had
access
to
this
beer
brooklyn
lager
may
even
join
my
drinking
rotation
such
a
good
beer
finger
and
a
half
head
amber
color
head
lasts
throughout
whole
time
but
eased
down
to
quarter
inch
good
lacing
throughout
malty
little
dry
smooth
as
hell
little
bit
of
a
hop
bite
medium
feel
i
loved
this
f
or
people
who
never
had
this
its
like
closer
to
a
less
intense
sam
adams
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
theres
a
definite
american
touch
to
this
and
i
love
it
ok
beer
to
me
not
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
had
it
has
a
light
bready
nose
with
light
grains
and
spice
it
pours
brilliant
gold
with
a
three
finger
fluffy
lacy
white
foam
collar
the
beer
has
a
good
malt
backbone
mostly
light
bread
and
grain
with
an
mild
initial
sweetness
that
dries
out
by
the
finish
the
hops
taste
like
they
have
been
added
in
flavors
with
herbal
and
spicy
flavors
mingling
with
the
balancing
hop
bitterness
a
very
drinkable
refreshing
medium
to
medium
light
bodied
beer
with
slightly
above
average
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
lager
but
nothing
that
puts
this
ahead
of
the
pack
this
lager
pours
darker
than
expected
with
a
nice
amber
colour
and
quickly
dissipating
head
it
smells
good
perhaps
a
bit
metallic
but
that
could
have
something
to
do
with
how
fresh
it
is
it
is
very
tasty
just
enough
body
and
sweet
malt
to
set
it
apart
from
other
lagers
the
hops
are
not
pronounced
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
whatsoever
a
quality
lager
to
be
sure
overall
not
my
thing
im
afraid
lagers
in
general
dont
do
it
for
me
but
as
such
things
go
this
isnt
bad
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
doubt
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
another
nice
brew
from
new
york
one
of
the
best
lagers
ever

nice
if
not
extraordinary

is
my
review
dude
i
dont
understand
why
this
is
rating
so
high
i
found
it
drinkable
refreshing
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
maybe
i
got
an
old
one
out
the

five

a

refreshing
not
to
complex
lager
for
when
you
want
a
change
of
pace
from
the
heavier
stuff
a
solid
session
beer
very
british
much
like
old
speckled
hen
simple
lager
with
malt
and
more
hops
than
usual
overall
this
is
a
great
american
session
solid
lager
best
chilled
nice
consistent
hoppy
flavor
throughout
with
a
very
smooth
finish
very
solid
amber
lager
one
of
the
best
i
have
tried
in
the
u
s
not
a
style
i
usually
go
to
but
this
one
does
the
trick
fairly
nondescript
aroma
with
a
caramelly
malt
backbone
and
a
dry
lightly
bitter
finish
pours
a
dark
caramelamber
with
minimal
off
white
head
disappointing
appearance
overall
aroma
is
toasted
bread
some
caramel
lager
yeast
as
it
warms
and
hints
of
some
earthy
hops
in
there
flavor
follows
suit
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
overall
solid
lager
reminds
of
great
lakes
elliot
ness
but
the
less
sweet
of
the
two
options
would
drink
again
but
happy
i
only
grabbed
a
single
and
not
a
full
sixer
of
this
my
personal
goto
beer
its
nothing
crazy
no
over
the
top
hops
or
malts
just
a
tasty
drinkable
good
beer
especially
when
youre
not
trying
to
drink
bud
products
or
natty
good
but
simple
this
is
a
beer
id
reccomend
to
someone
if
im
trying
to
steer
someone
clear
of
bud
or
coors
pours
a
medium
brown
with
medium
sticky
headaroma
is
somewhat
hoppy
this
is
a
complex
brew
in
my
opinion
has
a
hoppy
taste
but
still
a
very
smooth
taste
overall
very
filling
beer
indeed
and
i
think
it
would
go
great
with
a
backyard
bbq
must
be
taste
with
grilled
steak
still
pretty
good
and
i
would
drink
again
great
brooklyn
lager
reminds
me
a
little
of
falcon
bayerskt
but
with
20
times
more
flavor
and
aroma
o
a
tasty
and
great
lager
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
in
the
future
pours
a
medium
amber
visible
carbonation
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
or
lacing
aromas
are
light
what
is
there
is
a
blend
of
light
citrus
caramel
and
wet
cardboard
tastes
are
dry
caramel
a
bit
of
biscuit
a
bit
of
citrus
on
the
swallow
overall
this
is
a
fairly
mild
beer
as
a
lager
i
give
it
credit
for
bringing
more
to
the
table
than
a
lot
do
in
this
category
but
the
word
forgettable
keeps
creeping
into
my
mind
when
compared
to
most
beers
i
drink
nicely
balanced
but
could
use
more
saaz
true
to
style
and
a
great
example
of
a
drinkable
pils
finish
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
light
hop
notes
in
the
flavor
malt
is
slightly
grainy
but
no
dycetyl
or
dms
is
present
carbonation
is
perfect
as
is
the
serving
temperature
o
confession
i
love
this
beer
more
than
i
probably
should
nothing
really
blows
you
away
but
this
is
a
consistently
solid
eversodrinkable
lager
this
is
what
adjunct
macro
garbage
could
taste
like
if
any
of
the
brewers
gave
a
crap
while
this
beer
isnt
going
to
win
any
big
awards
it
is
a
great
consistent
brew
great
job
brooklyn
overall
really
pleasant
because
this
doesnt
quite
seem
like
a
vienna
lager
what
with
the
strong
american
hopping
im
not
going
to
rate
it
as
one
bjcp
does
not
have
a
category
for
american
amber
lager
thats
a
problem
this
is
a
beer
i
could
come
back
to
again
and
again
it
is
a
wellstructured
balanced
hoppy
craft
lager
easily
one
of
my
top
five
beers
of
all
time
clean
refreshing
and
remarkable
but
not
a
vienna
lager
oa
simple
but
enjoyable
beer
this
thing
wont
take
you
away
from
your
pliny
or
bcbs
habit
but
if
you
need
a
decent
easy
drinking
beer
at
the
airport
bar
this
is
a
good
choice
o
really
quite
drinkable
as
in
grab
a
six
pack
but
not
at
aus
price
point
overall
a
really
nice
lager
that
is
well
crafted
and
tasty
and
comes
highly
recommended
overall
the
same
style
as
yuengling
and
significantly
better
you
can
find
pretty
clear
similarities
between
the
two
but
brooklyn
lager
has
a
much
more
developed
taste
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
would
be
excellent
with
cookouts
and
barbecue
which
is
incidentally
exactly
where
i
tried
this
one
weak
abv
for
me
but
i
had
this
beer
in
new
york
on
tap
and
it
was
amazing
the
4
pints
i
had
complimented
my
shepherds
pie
extremely
well
i
forgot
the
name
of
the
pub
or
else
id
mention
them
oh
well
i
do
suggest
going
to
the
heartland
brewery
tho
dark
blonde
kinda
orange
with
a
head
that
dies
to
a
ring
but
leaves
good
lacing
the
smell
is
a
sweet
malt
and
a
sharp
bitterness
the
taste
is
more
bitter
with
a
grassy
pine
bitterness
from
start
to
finish
and
a
light
toasted
tea
sweetness
pretty
good
beer
i
say
it
mirrors
sam
adams
but
less
sweet
more
bitter
overall
this
is
a
paradoxical
blend
of
not
that
special
and
completely
unique
i
could
and
probably
will
crave
this
on
a
hot
humid
day
starts
sweet
and
fruity
followed
by
some
yeastiness
and
bready
feel
in
the
body
plus
some
roasted
feel
finishing
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
overall
a
good
vienna
lager
not
the
best
not
the
worst
but
better
than
average
enjoyable
simple
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
really
refreshing
lager
that
could
be
a
great
session
beer
overall
a
super
lager
with
subtle
hops
and
floralcitrus
tones
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
not
an
outstanding
one
either
for
the
price
there
are
other
beers
in
the
same
category
at
a
better
price
maybe
they
are
not
made
with
the
same
quality
ingredients
but
i
cannot
know
or
tell
the
difference
that
is
not
to
say
that
i
do
not
enjoy
this
one
because
i
do
i
just
believe
that
its
a
bit
overly
priced
for
what
you
get
i
got
it
on
sale
for
7
99
six
pack
a
similar
beer
out
of
pennsylvania
i
also
picked
up
for
7
99
but
it
was
for
a
12
pack
i
have
been
on
this
tirade
for
a
while
now
but
beer
has
gotten
overly
costly
as
of
late
or
so
it
seems
that
has
not
deterred
me
from
drinking
it
but
i
feel
a
bubble
burst
coming
at
least
i
hope
a
leveling
on
to
the
review
the
color
is
a
golden
red
the
smell
is
flat
nothing
much
to
express
there
the
taste
is
good
its
not
too
much
of
anything
which
to
me
says
balance
that
is
a
good
thing
especially
in
a
lager
this
is
as
someone
else
put
a
very
sessionable
beer
although
if
you
plan
on
saving
some
cash
i
wouldnt
put
a
way
too
many
because
there
are
much
better
beers
in
the
same
price
range
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
i
do
wish
that
it
was
more
in
the
same
price
range
of
its
real
competition
because
for
lagers
you
have
a
lot
of
competition
and
at
much
better
prices

an

with

doesnt

long
nice
and
clear
smells
like
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of

about
the
same
the
bitter
from
the
hops
outweighing
the
sweetness
finishes
clean
and
a
little
dry
thinner

overall
a
very
good
lager
but
theres
others
from
brooklyn
i
like
better
o
a
pretty
flavor
lager
a
bit
too
hoppy
and
floral
for
my
personal
tastes
but
very
dynamic
for
its
style
brooklyn
lager
from
brookly
brewery
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
quality
craft
lager
with
amazing
taste
the
lager
gives
out
amazing
taste
without
a
hard
acid
level
this
lager
although
tasteful
continues
its
lager
tradition
in
how
light
weight
the
beer
settles
although
one
could
make
the
arguement
that
the
brew
has
a
almost
too
much
hoppy
taste
but
in
visiting
new
york
city
this
beer
is
a
must
try
so
overall
option
i
enjoy
it
pours
a
very
thick
head
that
stays
for
a
long
time
color
is
sort
of
a
golden
brown
couldnt
smell
the
beer
out
of
the
bottle
had
to
pour
it
to
smell
not
an
overly
attractive
scent
taste
is
very
good
a
hint
of
malt
with
a
nice
hoppy
kick
mouthfeel
is
good
not
too
carbonated
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
recently
definitely
a
fan
of
preprohibition
style
lagers
o
aside
from
the
decent
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
passable
lager
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
as
far
as
everyday
easily
attainable
lagers
go
this
one
sure
is
unique
and
atypical
easy
drinking
despite
being
quite
different
worth
trying
again
if
it
had
been
awhile
as
with
anything
ive
enjoyed
from
brooklyn
this
is
a
well
brewed
beer
o
im
a
huge
fan
of
quality
lagers
but
amberred
lagers
arent
among
my
favorites
more
a
munich
helles
and
german
pilsener
guy
still
though
i
enjoy
some
offerings
from
this
style
and
this
is
one
there
isnt
a
ton
going
on
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
i
really
liked
that
the
malt
is
very
noticeable
without
being
sweet
a
beer
that
i
probably
wont
buy
again
but
if
the
beer
were
offered
id
certainly
drink
it
again
overall
crisp
and
refreshing
probably
a
good
option
on
a
hot
summer
day
flavors
not

overall
this
is
a
pretty

good
lager
its
relatively
cheap
and
i
could
guzzle
this
recommended
by
me
overall
a
decent
lager
with
good
intentions
via
cutting
out
the
usual
adjuncts
nothing
offputting
but
nothing
much
to
remember
it
by
i
cant
remember
if
there
were
much
malts
but
it
went
down
great
on

hot
and

color
with
mild
carbonation
and
mild
head
malty
yeasty
aroma
with
a
floral
and

hit
from

more
carbonation
in
the
sip
than
it
appears
overall
taste
is
similar
to
its
aroma
slight
tang
with
some
sweetness
not
really
bitter
at
all
perhaps
too
light
it
could
be
in
my
fridge
im
not
sure
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
viennastyle
lager
or
an
americanized
version
of
one
in
either
case
it
has
a
nice
flavor
just
not
quite
enough
of
it
to
suit
me
an
average
lager
at
best
aroma
of
sweet
citrus
malt

i
am
going
to
have
another
right
now
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
lager
it
has
more
depth
than
most
other
good
lagers
that
ive
tasted
such
as
yuengling
to
sam
adams
name
two
and
a
great
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
that
balance
combined
with
how
crisp
and
clean
the
beer
is
makes
for
an
excellent
session
beer
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
i
enjoyed
this
lager
with
a
naples
style
pizza
and
it
was
the
perfect
match
a
crisp
clean
lager
with
a
medium
body
nice
brown
color
and
smell
i
drank
this
from
the
bottle
ice
cold
it
was
refreshing
and
the
flavor
is
reliable
and
outstanding
finish
taste
pours
copper
orange
with
a
finger
of
foam
that
dwindled
to
a
nice
lacing
nose
is
aromatic
with
a
rich
malt
profile
cracker
biscuit
carmel
some
shy
hops
come
up
to
offer
a
little
grass
and
tangerine
citrus
taste
is
earthy
and
clean
the
pale
malt
is
nice
and
round
and
the
hops
lend
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
make
it
drink
well
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flat
could
have
used
a
few
more
bubbles
but
it
was
smooth
semi
dry
and
had
a
grainy
and
slightly
bitter
finish
it
wont
blow
your
mind
but
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
i
suppose
i
would
prefer
this
style
without
the
dry
hopping
and
without
the
american
hops
they
give
it
a
kind
of
bite
that
im
not
looking
for
in
this
style
of
beer
without
it
it
would
probably
lead
to
a
cleaner
more
malt
forward
amber
lager
which
is
what
i
like
these
days
keep
the
citrusy
hops
and
the
dry
hopping
for
pale
lagers
apas
and
ipas
overall
smell
and
taste
are
just
ok
but
kind
of
lacking
complexity
of
flavors
i
like
other
brooklyn
beers
much
more
and
find
their
other
styles
more
impressive
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
im
going
to
leave
it
at
that
its
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
overall
its
nice
to
drink
it
its
a
good
lager
after
all
but
even
though
i
had
mediumlow
expectations
on
this
i
was
expecting
more
o
one
of
the
best
lagers
around
reminded
me
of
a
well
hopped
kellerbier
o
good
drinkable
beer
it
was
light
on
a
lot
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
for
lager
there
was
nothing
that
really
stood
out
about
this
to
me
but
thats
not
always
a
bad
thing
its
still
tasted
nicer
than
some
other
drinkables
in
the
same
categories
bud
coors
etc
overall
i
am
hoping
this
one
is
bad
tap
lines
i
was
at
a
bar
that
wasnt
the
most
craft
friendly
other
than
that
i
found
it
to
be
on
the
verge
of
undrinkable
d
really
solid
lager
here
for
some
reason
this
is
distributed
to
guatemala
this
must
have
been
the
100th
ive
have
since
i
have
been
down
here
easy
drinking
refreshing
lager
yet
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
spending
more
and
more
on
it
for
hot
sweaty
nyc
days
to
lakeside
views
in
guatemala
i
recommend
this
one
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
i
wouldnt
expect
that
much
from
a
lager
this
is
close
to
expiration
date
maybe
that
is
the
reason
to
seem
to
be
better
than
the
last
one
i
tried
and
definitely
better
than
their
pilsner
version
very
flexible
beer
works
as
a
session
or
for
enjoying
it
slowly
o
a
good
allpurpose
beer
but
not
one
that
will
hold
the
attention
of
the
seasoned
beer
drinker
for
very
long
very
well
crafted
and
the
hop
bitterness
saves
it
from
being
overly
dull
its
reliable
and
simple
but
not
particularly
exciting
interesting
but
not
all
good
a
bit
raw
and
sweet
with
too
much
toasted
character
drinks
well
but
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
too
broad
brooklyns
addition
of
american
hops
to
a
vienna
style
lager
yields
an
excellent
brew
this
is
noticeably
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
if
anybody
can
find
a
better
session
lager
available
in
ontario
let
me
know
can
someone
send
me
a
12pack
of
this
while
this
might
just
be
the
sierra
nevada
on
the
east
coast
this
is
a
really
good
lager
nice
brown
color
with
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
and
a
super
clean
finish
wonderful
session
beer
and
perfect
with
lots
of
food
a
must
stop
along
with
momofuku
on
fridays
when
in
nyc
not
a
bad
brew
i
think
it
needs
a
touch
more
sweetness
on
the
palate
just
for
enjoyment
without
it
its
more
of
an
everyday
drinker
but
i
could
really
take
pleasure
from
this
if
there
were
a
sweeter
edge
notes
a
straight
forward
and
very
drinkable
beer
cheers
the
palate
is
similar
to
the
excellent
aroma
mentioned
above
and
you
see
a
complex
harmony
between
the
american
hops
and
the
toasted
malt
the
finish
is
dry
leaving
a
pretty
decent
reminiscence
of
the
whole
story
of
this
beer
told
three
times
aroma
taste
finish
piney
hops
and

this
is
an
excellent
beer

m
nothing

a
good
lager
the
flavor
is
good
and
the
feel
is

fairly
robust
flavors
with
good
balance
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
its
an
enjoyable
beer
not
my
favorite
lager
but
a
good
go
to
in
nyc
this
beer
would
be
a
perfect
to
have
in
the
summer
o
overall
a
great
session
beer
nice
balanced
lager
very
fresh
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
this
one
was
something
i
wanted
to
try
for
a
while
but
i
never
seem
to
float
to
the
lager
section
of
the
liquor
store
though
i
do
enjoy
a
nice
pilsner
or
black
lager
it
is
stated
as
being
a
preprohibition
lager
and
i
understand
exactly
what
they
mean
as
the
hops
and
malt
are
omnipresent
during
the
entire
experience
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
the
colour
was
a
light
ruby
red
nice
head
retention
and
lacing
throughout
it
smelled
of
light
caramel
malt
with
some
pleasant
aromatic
hops
on
the
nose
i
drank
a
couple
of
them
and
they
flowed
nicely
its
really
a
shame
that
americans
did
the
whole
prohibition
thing
and
i
wish
they
would
have
bootlegged
beer
like
this
throughout
as
it
could
destroy
any
macro
sidebyside
hell
it
could
snipe
down
a
crap
miller
light
from
miles
away
enjoy
it
in
the
sunshine
with
a
burger
or
a
brat
and
a
side
of
slaw
o
probably
my
favorite
red
lager
to
date
its
absolutely
delicious
but
probably
a
bit
offstyle
this
definitely
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
rich
barley
malt
biscuity
caramel
a
little
toffee
hop
bitterness
is
medium
floral
citrusy
lemony
semidry
finish
body
is
lightmedium
a
little
dry
in
the
aftertaste
nice
carbonation
very
smooth
overall
this
beer
was
a
complete
shock
i
was
expecting
a
standard
american
lager
without
much
flavour
but
this
delivered
a
properly
good
interesting
pale
ale
lager
cross
impressive
a
lively
lager
more
fun
than
most
it
pours
a
lighter
amber
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
sticks
around
the
aroma
is
very
crisp
properly
a
winter
lager
a
little
nutty
on
the
malt
profile
with
a
clean
rounded
finish
taste
follows
the
nose
and
this
beer
is
a
dead
give
away
as
brooklyn
lager
every
time
its
so
distinct
in
terms
of
balance
and
richer
malts
than
the
industry
standard
its
really
unmistakable
the
red
malts
give
it
a
nice
body
not
boring
at
all
and
the
carbonation
is
there
overall
not
the
most
adventurous
or
profound
thing
to
come
out
of
brooklyn
brewery
but
its
a
really
servicable
lager
the
lager
for
the
pale
ale
drinker
i
like
to
call
it
yummy
stuff
golf
course
beer
to
me
at
its
finest
it
is
what
it
is
its
hardly
a
classic
but
it
does
what
it
does
pleasantly
enough
and
i
confess
to
having
a
soft
spot
for
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
murky
light
amber
bordering
on
dark
mustard
yellow
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
with
sticky
lacing
leaving
creamy
patches
like
spider
webs
on
the
glass
the
body
is
clear
of
particles
obviously
but
has
a
murky
look
the
beer
is
transparent
with
some
bubbles
but
murky
the
beer
smells
wet
and
grassy
with
notes
of
slightly
citrus
light
caramel
malts
from
the
can
the
malt
smell
is
much
more
potent
and
sweet
syrupy
reminding
me
of
rice
pudding
and
candy
the
beer
tastes
quite
sweet
for
a
lager
with
light
biscuit
grass
and
slight
citrus
the
beer
touches
the
tongue
as
light
citrus
apple
juice
before
moving
into
grassy
hops
with
light
citrus
and
slight
bread
and
then
opening
into
syrupy
sweet
on
sides
of
the
mouth
but
never
striking
cloying
levels
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
and
grassy
but
overall
quite
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
leaving
the
mouth
wet
with
saliva
and
slightly
dry
with
bitter
lingerings
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
put
back
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
the
cans
to
session
them
and
session
them
i
did
the
sweet
taste
is
a
little
too
much
for
what
i
would
normally
like
and
i
kind
of
wish
the
grass
was
more
there
but
overall
a
lovely
mediocre
chugger
this
beer
will
not
blow
you
away
but
is
solid
where
it
counts
just
one
of
those
beers
that
you
can
have
whenever
and
not
be
unhappy
goes
well
with
a
nice
greasy
meal
too
o
a
solid
preprohibition
style
lager
with
plenty
of
flavor
with
a
full
not
light
or
fizzy
mouthfeel
nice
and
malty
without
overdoing
the
sweetness
definitely
a
solid
choice
for
lager
fans
o
im
really
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
im
trying
to
open
myself
to
it
this
is
decent
balanced
with
a
very
restrained
metallic
flavor
usually
i
get
a
stronger
metallic
flavor
with
the
style
i
get
some
nice
caramel
and
bready
malts
in
the
flavor
that
i
enjoyed
i
just
find
myself
wishing
it
were
made
with
ale
yeast
overall
a
good
herbal
and
floral
lager
that
is
crisp
and
delicious
o
this
one
worked
perfectly
as
a
palate
cleanser
in
between
2
bigger
brews
very
sessionable
and
good
clean
flavors
overallthis
is
a
tasty
beer
it
is
a
bit
flabby
to
style
a
little
sweet
and
full
bodied
but
a
very
tasty
quaff
o
not
a
bad
little
lager
bit
more
tart
then
im
used
to
being
born
and
raised
on
yeungling
but
it
was
def
enjoyable
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
brews
and
will
have
this
one
again
in
the
near
future
pours
up
with
a
blanca
head
copper
colored
boogie
outta
control
smells
of
hops
german
perhaps
nothin
crazy
maybe
a
lil
wee
bit
o
malt
its
nice
and
bitter
like
an
american
pilsner
only
because
its
not
a
true
pils
to
the
best
of
my
lack
of
knowledge
sweet
lil
baby
kiss
of
malts
nice
medium

good
carbo
solid
beer
solid
is
the
word
here
brooklyn
is
a
solid
brewery
not
gettin
a
fully
here
but
ill
remain
halfmast
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
found
myself
having
a
second
and
will
definitely
have
this
again
final
grade
3
92
a
solid
b
grade
brooklyn
lager
is
one
flagship
that
should
be
welcomed
into
canadian
ports
with
open
arms
few
amber
lagers
that
i
have
tried
are
of
such
high
quality
and
this
stuff
is
noticeably
heavier
on
the
americanstyle
hops
than
most
of
them
placing
it
in
a
comfortable
middle
ground
between
ambers
and
apas
well
worth
purchasing
at
least
once
and
something
i
will
probably
return
to
in
the
future
overall
this
was
my
first
bb
beer
and
although
i
enjoyed
it
frankly
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
perhaps
its
the
allure
that
the
brooklyn
label
holds
for
a
new
york
native
d
i
wanted
something
with
a
bit
more
character
but
im
sure
ill
have
this
beer
again
on
occasion
if
you
are
a
hophead
you
will
probably
like
this
o
decent
lager
by
brooklyn
brewery
nothing
spectacular
but
something
i
would
grab
at
a
bar
if
available
overall
i
might
want
to
pick
this
up
again
really
great
lager
o
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
with
still
a
quite
nice
amount
of
complexity
and
character
would
be
a
nice
regular
choice
if
i
could
find
it
for
something
less
than
4
overall
the
flavors
in
this
beer
just
dont
mesh
well
on
my
palate
seems
carefullyenough
crafted
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
again
the
beer
by
my
favourite
writer
i
got
my
hands
on
it
in
pune
a
small
city
in
india
the
perfect
lager
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
real
thirst
quencher
not
sure
how
it
pours
because
i
drank
it
from
the
bottle
but
the
taste
is
crisp
clean
and
slightly
bitter
it
was
served
cold
but
tasted
nice
even
when
it
wasnt
so
cold
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
definitely
refreshing
and
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
of
these
however
its
simplistic
and
rather
one
dimensional
with
caramel
malts
taking
the
forefront
the
hops
are
noticeable
but
are
not
the
saving
grace
for
the
style
its
good
but
overall
its
not
great
stay
thirsty
my
friends
fuck
blue
moon
seriously
this
shit
is
not
craft
beer
its
mass
produced
wheat
beer
and
for
that
matter
wheat
beer
is
fucking
boring
make
this
stuff
taste
better
if
youre
going
to
try
and
take
over
the
fucking
market
with
it
you
assholes
thanks
have
a
nice
day
o
i
would
buy
this
again
i
like
the
adherence
to
the
reinheitsgbot
this
is
a
pure
lager
in
traditional
style
i
can
imagine
my
grandfather
enjoying
this
after
a
long
day
at
work
satisfying
and
refreshing
i
last
enjoyed
this
beer
directly
from
the
bottle
but
if
i
recall
correctly
from
previous
experiences
it
was
of
a
light
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
the
most
dominant
aroma
is
malt
this
beer
is
nice
and
clean
tasting
as
a
lager
should
be
but
then
going
against
the
grain
it
has
flavor
you
can
taste
malt
and
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
hop
bitterness
if
i
had
to
have
a
somewhat
widely
available
lager
beer
this
would
be
my
choice
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
vasse
the
beer
is
an
orangecopper
coloring
with
a
sparse
uneven
filmy
covering
aromas
of
roasted
grains
and
floral
highlights
flavors
are
rich
roasted
and
slightly
tangy
with
a
biscuit
and
toast
backbone
and
some
juniper
highlights
roasty
and
tangy
aftertaste
with
a
sharp
light
and
crisp
finish
easy
to
drink
with
full
body
and
flavors
good
o
i
have
to
say
i
do
love
lagers
and
this
one
was
definitely
enjoyableill
have
to
check
out
brooklyn
more
often
from
now
on
tasty
beer
for
sure
o
this
was
is
a
decent
go
to
lager
if
you
dont
have
too
many
options
i
prefer
boston
lager
but
this
is
definitely
close
not
bad
but
could
definitely
use
a
little
bit
more
flavor
unique
but
not
sure
if
im
down
with
this
pickle
taste
overall
4
5
overall
brooklyn
lager
is
my
favorite
amber
lager
out
there
and
may
even
be
my
favorite
lager
i
love
the
sweet
malt
backbone
that
contributes
to
both
a
lovely
aroma
and
nice
balanced
taste
warm
creamy
and
malty
enough
to
compete
with
an
amber
or
brown
ale
and
it
looks
great
in
a
glass
the
beer
poured
with
a
hazy
gold
color
with
noticeable
carbonation
an
uneven
bubbly
frothy
head
and
good
lacing
on
the
sides
the
aromas
are
a
mix
of
sugars
orange
and
grains
flavoring
of
the
drink
had
a
relative
bittersweetness
and
bread
or
yeast
taste
the
drink
was
light
and
a
bit
watery
but
still
refreshing
a
better
refreshing
drink
for
the
evening
just
a
really
good
beer
and
i
say
that
surprisingly
nothing
like
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
loved
it
dark
amber
colour
with
a
very
dense
offwhite
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
of
malt
corn
flakes
hops
and
slight
fruit
and
honey
slightly
sweet
on
the
tongue
malty
and
bready
medium
body
and
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
bit
more
of
a
soft
hop
background
o
great
flavor
profile
i
enjoyed
it
back
in
1998
i
had
my
first
brooklyn
lager
and
i
knew
then
that
some
14
years
later
i
would
still
be
enjoying
it
nice
amber
in
a
pint
glass
with
plenty
of
balance
plenty
of
hops
and
malt
backbone
but
the
malt
stays
with
you
each
sip
nice
finish
and
plenty
of
complexity
for
a
session
beer
brooklyn
lager
is
classic
amber
color
with
medium
ofwhite

with
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
floral
some
bready
taste
is
medium

some
tart
finish
is
light
grassy
and
floral
mild
bitterness
that
doesnt
linger
has
a
medium
body
readily
drinkable
o
worth
a
6
pack
at
most
prices
pours
amber
with
a
white
head
plenty
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
of
hops
and
some
sweetness
the
flavor
of
malt
hits
you
up
front
and
the
bitterness
hops
come
in
to
balance
it
very
well
the
hop
flavor
is
not
overpowering
but
it
is
definitely
present
the
body
is
light
but
the
flavors
really
help
this
stand
out
the
carbonation
is
just
right
this
is
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
lager
o
very
full
flavored
and
a
great
example
for
the
style
quite
easy
to
drink
and
very
much
a
session
beer
color
is
a
reddish
amber
with
a
moderate
white
head
citrus
hops
are
noticeable
in
the
scent
with
some
bread
and
caramel
as
well
very
nice
the
taste
is
bready
and
nutty
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
quite
flavorful
and
complex
compared
to
most
lagers
ive
had
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
has
to
be
one
of
the
top
of
its
style
o
a
truly
astonishing
lager
ive
had
this
beer
so
many
times
im
taking
it
for
granted
when
sitting
down
reviewing
this
beer
i
realize
how
great
it
is
and
why
im
so
comfortable
having
a
couple
of
these
from
time
to
time
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
seek
it
out
again
it
smells
sweet
and
is
a
malty
well
balanced
lager
that
tastes
very
bold
of
either
saaz
or
hellertau
hops
with
a
wonderful
lagering
malt
that
keeps
everything
in
check
it
has
a
caramely
sweetness
to
it
and
as
it
goes
down
produces
a
sweet
dry
yet
malty
bready
flavor
this
lager
is
definitely
a
step
above
most
others
and
can
be
easily
enjoyed
any
day
of
the
week
with
any
meal
reddish
amber
color
and
leaves
a
thin
white
head
that
disappates
quickly
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
caramel
aspects
that
give
hints
of
honey
and
lemon
the
taste
of
this
lager
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
sticky
sweet
malt
weighs
on
your
palate
in
a
good
way
and
there
is
a
lemon
wheat
flavor
on
the
palate
that
makes
this
a
balanced
refreshing
brew
still
a
favorite
of
mine
after
all
these
years
this
was
a
staple
in
my
apartment
when
it
first
came
out
still
like
to
have
it
on
hand
huge
head
that
towers
over
my
glass
four
fingers
plus
clear
reddish
amber
with
mild
carbonation
lots
of
lace
clinging
in
clumps
and
rings
smell
has
lots
of
yeasty
bread
with
toasted
malt
graininess
a
nice
bit
of
floral
hops
and
light
citrus
a
hint
of
earth
sneaking
in
taste
is
solid
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
right
up
front
caramel
sweetness
is
couched
in
malt
a
bit
of
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
sourdough
firm
hop
bitterness
balances
beautifully
finish
is
long
and
dry
with
an
earthycitrus
hoppiness
just
a
touch
of
citrus
and
hop
oil
lingering
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
mildly
effervescent
carbonation
that
is
spot
on
just
a
great
overall
beer
super
drinkable
with
an
ability
to
be
a
gateway
beer
while
at
the
same
time
offer
all
a
sophisticated
palate
could
want
proud
to
make
this
one
review
number
500
this
was
a
really
good
lager
could
easily
session
these
probably
the
best
lager
ive
had
to
date
o
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
very
good
lager
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
update
may
9
its
been
a
several
months
since
i
sampled
this
beer
i
put
a
bottle
in
the
freezer
for
about
20
minutes
and
the
temperature
was
quite
good
i
noticed
more
orange
rind
in
the
smell
and
taste
in
general
more
fruity
with
a
strong
orange
accent
quite
a
good
beer
at
a
moderately
cold
temp
those
new
on
the
scene
might
appreciate
this
brieflybut
with
more
experience
in
the
field
theyll
no
longer
take
the
last
exit
to
brooklyn
overall
definitely
an
unexpected
lagerpale
ale
combination
yet
brooklyn
pulled
it
off
to
make
it
a
wellrounded
session
beer
this
will
make
it
to
my
kegerator
in
the
future
the
lager
fans
who
expect
just
a
carameltoasted
malt
presence
with
this
style
might
not
like
this
one
due
to
the
mild
hoppiness
i
didnt
mind
it
at
all
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
nice
alternative
to
sa
boston
lager
had
this
on
tap
at
tameal
cafe
in
ikebukuro
tokyo
japan
this
beer
is
brewed
by
kiuchi
hitachino
for
japanese
consumers
pretty
great
refreshing
red
lager
oa
good
lager
ive
had
this
brew
many
times
before
not
my
favorite
as
i
trend
toward
a
hoppier
taste
hazed
amber
blonde
with
a
big
fluffy
head
of
cream
colored
foam
that
sticks
to
the
glass
caramel
malt
and
grassy
grain
with
a
touch
of
lemony
hops
grainy
and
toasty
with
nice
flavors
of
caramel
mint
and
citric
hops
medium
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
a
good
lager
much
like
sam
adams
bl
very
nice
would
make
a
great
session
lager
slightly
sweet
malt
with
a
nice
aromatic
hop
character
very
similar
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
good
stuff
im
going
to
try
this
again
fresh
to
see
if
there
is
much
of
a
difference
my
hunch
is
that
the
uniquenss
of
this
lager
comes
from
the
fact
that
its
been
in
the
bottle
a
while
stand
by
for
an
update
its
pretty
smooth
and
on
the
light
bodied
side
could
easily
make
a
session
out
of
these
i
enjoy
this
lager
like
i
do
sam
adams
boston
ale
or
ipswich
original
ale
for
a
session
beer
more
than
i
expected
from
brooklyns
staple
beer
but
lets
not
get
ahead
of
ourselves
not
exceptional
but
very
good
o
great
session
brew
and
the
price
is
usually
right
this
is
very
similar
imo
to
a
boston
lager
mo
prickly
on
the
tongue
not
as
great
as
sa
bl
on
tap
but
itll
do
in
a
pinch
one
of
the
better
lagers
that
ive
had
this
offering
was
very
enjoyable
very
refreshing
and
is
recommended
o
not
what
i
expected
from
a
lager
dont
know
what
preprohibition
style
means
is
this
like
anchor
stream
lager
yeast
at
ale
temps
i
like
it
very
drinkable
good
transition
beer
for
someone
who
thinks
bud
is
good
nothing
too
scary
overall
perfect
all
around
beer
no
matter
how
hot
or
cold
it
or
how
your
feeling
you
will
adapt
lovely
to
this
beer
in
essence
it
might
have
properties
of
other
famous
microbrewed
lagers
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
call
brooklyn
lager
my
number
2
when
it
comes
to
lagers
you
know
whos
number
1
enjoy
brooklyn
preprohibition
lager
pours
a
couple
fingers
of
dense
white
foam
over
a
slightly
cloudy
effervescent
amber
brew
the
nose
is
lager
yeast
funk
and
sweet
clean
light
barley
malt
with
notes
of
honey
and
spring
herbs
the
flavor
is
simple
and
direct
sweet
light
malt
balanced
with
mild
herbaceous
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
round
yet
light
finishing
semidry
and
clean
with
only
a
sticky
lacing
left
behind
in
the
glass
this
is
a
deceptively
simple
lager
sold
for
a
premium
price
but
is
it
worth
it
i
would
say
yes
its
so
simple
there
is
nowhere
for
the
brewmaster
to
cover
his
tracks
every
element
of
taste
and
texture
is
out
in
the
open
and
every
element
is
in
perfect
balance
sweet
but
not
insipid
the
hop
presence
just
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
pleasant
in
the
mouth
but
dry
enough
to
be
quenching
a
nice
brew
o
good
but
not
great
could
take
it
or
leave
it
after
having
so
many
different
flavorful
beers
i
feel
that
this
beer
just
couldnt
hold
its
own
probably
not
its
fault
it
was
overshadowed
by
great
beers
however
o
not
bad
would
make
an
excellent
summer
or
winter
session
beer
give
it
a
shot
after
all
its
from
brooklyn
brewery
overall
great
to
have
with
friends
that
enjoy
lagers
this
is
a
very
good
lager
and
very
enjoyable
i
dont
think
it
is
excellent
or
outstanding
but
then
again
i
have
never
had
any
brooklyn
brew
that
i
thought
was
but
like
most
of
their
brews
this
is
a
good
beer
o
im
impressed
i
tend
to
not
purchase
many
lagers
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
not
sure
of
the
price
since
i
didnt
buy
it
but
ill
probably
check
this
out
again
overall
a
decent
beer
with
some
good
drinkability
mild
flavors
and
bitterness
make
it
easy
to
consume
although
slight
metallic
flavor
is
a
little
offputting
overall
a
good
beer
from
a
good
brewery
the
brew
master
says
to
drink
it
with
a
basket
of
fries
i
say
drink
it
with
a
nice
juicy
burger
with
cheese
and
bacon
pours
a
cloudy
orangeamber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
candy
sweet
almost
cloying
with
tangy
noble
hops
this
is
a
full
bodied
lager
with
a
sweet
malt
flavor
that
dominates
there
is
in
the
flavor
a
taste
that
follows
the
sroma
with
the
noble
hops
biting
into
the
sweetness
this
is
what
a
lager
should
be
and
a
good
one
to
introduce
your
yellowfizzy
stuff
friends
to
a
really
really
solid
enjoyable
and
drinkable
amber
lager
from
my
memory
of
it
this
is
quite
comparable
to
samuel
adams
boston
lager
overall
impression
good
beer
a
solid
sessiondrinking
lager
great
flavor
wellrounded
character
id
offer
this
to
most
of
my
friends
both
beer
connoisseurs
and
newbies
alike
bought
on
a
whim
and
not
a
disappointment
just
not
really
my
style
but
enjoyable
and
will
probably
buy
in
when
visited
by
lager
fans
fairly
drinkable
beer
although
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
while
good
the
hops
tend
to
be
a
bit
more
aggressive
than
what
i
prefer
still
a
pretty
nice
beer
in
my
mind
malt
and
hops
work
together
perfectly
this
makes
for
a
well
balanced
brew
with
good
mouthfeel
and
a
pleasant
aftertaste
very
drinkable
will
be
having
more
of
these
o
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
definitely
a
goto
beer
if
i
cant
make
up
my
mind
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
decent
looking
golden
amber
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
head
settles
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
caramel
elements
and
some
lager
yeast
aromas
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
it
wasnt
anything
over
the
top
but
had
a
good
drinkablity
to
it
the
malts
and
hops
are
pretty
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
here
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
nicely
carbonated
and
fairly
smooth
overall
its
a
good
drinking
beer
for
anytime
of
the
year
o
excellent
lager
probably
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
head
extremely
drinkable
could
easily
pop
a
sixer
without
thinking
too
hard
about
it
for
some
reason
theres
something
about
this
beer
that
doesnt
make
it
great
perhaps
the
malts
are
too
strong
or
the
hops
are
too
bitter
and
generic
but
this
is
just
a
goodok
beer
and
nothing
exceptional
worth
drinking
over
a
boston
lager
though
maybe
even
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
a
pretty
good
lager
overall
o
good
lager
but
a
little
too
watery
i
would
still
recommend
it
the
malt
backbone
is
just
as
broad
as
the
hop
character
a
solid
brew
from
start
to
finish
more
than
enough
flavor
and
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
enough
to
want
more
than
just
one
i
give
a
schlitz
for
this
solid
lager
if
it
were
more
cost
effective
i
would
gladly
give
two
schlitz
o
pretty
good
for
a
lager
could
drink
this
pretty
much
anytime
especially
from
the
can
overall
to
me
this
is
like
sa
boston
lagers
maltier
american
cousin
it
has
many
similar
aspects
in
flavour
and
aroma
profile
but
just
clocks
in
with
a
bit
more
malt
sweetness
than
sams
amber
lager
its
a
nice
little
beer
and
im
glad
that
even
shitty
places
selectionwise
usually
have
this
on
tap
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
good
but
its
just
a
bit
undercarbonated
maybe
this
is
just
an
off
bottle
the
flavor
is
there
though
oa
decent
lager
would
pick
up
to
try
and
convert
bmc
drinkers
o
sort
of
an
ubiquitous
beer
on
the
east
coast
it
seems
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
overall
a
great
beer
packs
a
huge
amount
of
flavour
for
a
lager
could
stand
with
being
a
bit
cheaper
cause
at
the
moment
its
got
a
33
markup
on
the
sam
adams
range
when
ive
seen
it
still
a
fantastic
lager
with
similarities
to
boston
lager
but
which
it
ultimately
outdoes
bit
harder
to
session
as
a
result
of
the
massive
flavour
and
slightly
higher
alcohol
omuch
better
than
i
originally
expected
before
opening
a
very
good
lager
this
is
the
first
amber
lager
i
have
had
and
it
is
a
very
good
start
with
this
type
of
beer
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
a
wonderful
plain
and
simple
session
beer
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
brew
up
whenever
im
in
need
of
a
session
and
find
it
in
the
area
looking
forward
to
visiting
the
brewery
next
year
o
a
top
option
if
looking
for
a
session
beer
with
plenty
of
flavour
solid
brew
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
still
a
nice
lager
that
i
can
see
myself
picking
up
now
and
again
o
excellent
lager
could
be
more
crispier
nice
flavors
that
enhance
the
beer
character
on
special
at
c
js
pub
in
kalamazoo
for
1
75
a
pint
a
darker
golden
brown
for
a
lager
beer
pencil
thin
head
with
little
lacing
smell
of
sweet
malt
and
grain
not
a
lot
going
for
it
until
you
taste
it
nice
hop
bite
with
mellow
tones
of
biscuit
and
rye
real
yummy
over
all
great
beer
for
the
price
time
to
order
another
i
am
a
fan
of
brooklyn
beers
and
whenever
i
want
a
simple
quality
easily
accessible
local
brew
i
often
reach
out
for
a
brooklyn
lager
overall
a
typical
lager
popular
for
mild
palates
and
drinkers
who
want
a
bit
of
flavor
but
dont
travel
too
far
off
the
path
not
a
repeat
purchase
for
me
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
lager
and
a
great
everyday
beer
ill
try
and
keep
a
couple
of
these
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
definitely
a
drinkable
choice
for
a
6pack
and
a
weekend
night
o
refreshing
on
a
hot
night
but
thats
the
only
time
id
choose
to
turn
to
it
overall
drinkability
actually
pretty
good
for
a
lager
would
have
gotten
a
better
score
if
not
for
the
staleness
and
astringency
ooverall
this
is
a
solid
brew
i
think
id
take
this
over
sam
adams
boston
lager
easy
drinking
and
very
flavorful
it
is
very
dinkable
but
other
than
that
nothing
special
o
a
really
nice
everyday
beer
one
i
would
have
again
this
was
poured
for
me
at
a
bar
but
the
color
was
a
nice
amber
color
light
copper
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
the
smell
is
very
crisp
and
clean
some
noble
hops
and
earthy
grains
the
taste
is
very
nice
crisp
noble
hops
dominate
the
aftertaste
and
i
get
a
toasted
barley
flavor
on
the
front
with
a
little
caramel
overall
i
was
impressed
a
mighty
fine
lager
which
ill
gladly
get
again
overall
very
excited
for
brooklyn
to
be
coming
mn
for
a
while
i
always
love
more
drinkable
brews
and
this
one
is
a
greatly
acceptable
choice
from
here
on
very
drinkable
and
a
great
future
conversion
beer
for
peers
overall
fantastic
lager
lager
will
never
be
my
style
but
i
dont
mind
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
when
the
situation
calls
for
it
pours
a
tranquil
clear
light
copper
with
lingering
offwhite
head
small
bubbles
of
carbonation
and
spots
of
lacing
nice
aroma
of
biscuity
malt
and
noble
hops
traces
of
diacetyl
smooth
crisp
taste
with
a
superb
balance
of
malty
sweetness
up
front
and
mild
lingering
hop
bitterness
overall
a
pleasant
and
fullflavored
lager
no
yellow
fizzy
stuff
here
little
stays
with
you
when
you
finish
as
the
aftertaste
is
just
a
tad
too
short
and
thin
i
think
this
suffers
from
being
a
beer
which
if
we
are
honest
exists
outside
a
clearly
identifiable
style
d
high
drinkability
a
good
sessionable
lager
with
decent
flavor
while
i
prefer
the
similar
yuengling
traditional
lager
this
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
easily
could
takes
its
place
in
my
fridge
clear
dark
golden
color
almost
no
head
just
a
couple
big
bubbles
floating
around
nose
has
a
big
malty
aroma
with
a
lot
of
grassy
earth
almost
like
i
just
ripped
up
a
patch
of
grass
flavor
has
a
lot
of
grainy
malts
but
some
fruity
hops
comes
through
but
get
covered
up
by
a
bitter
grassy
dryness
orange
fruit
middle
but
too
much
of
a
dirty
bitter
dryness
this
was
alright
to
drink
all
night
at
a
bar
with
no
selection
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
beautiful
clear
orange
amber
with
a
thick
pale
buttertan
head
that
leaves
some
substantial
lacing
aroma
is
strong
malty
and
slightly
fruity
malty
flavor
has
firm
fruity
underpinning
and
a
slight
hoppy
note
firmbodied
texture
is
smooth
fizzy
and
lively
normally
i
dont
care
much
for
lagers
but
this
is
a
happy
exception
overall
excellent
session
beer
especially
in
the
summer
poured
from
a
can
into
a
4
oz
tasting
glass
a
really
nice
lager
with
a
surprising
amount
of
flavour
and
a
pleasant
balance
not
too
much
aroma
but
the
flavour
makes
up
for
it
a
decent
lager
easy
drinking
for
sure
and
cheap
a
few
months
ago
i
had
this
out
of
a
bottle
that
was
a
few
months
fresher
than
this
can
thought
it
was
hoppier
even
a
little
better
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
but
i
wouldnt
ever
turn
one
down
i
poured
this
lager
into
a
pint
glass
good
initial
head
that
dissipated
quickly
backed
by
natural
light
the
beer
has
a
coppery
reddish
hue
very
little
hop
aroma
more
complex
in
its
malty
flavor
with
decent
carbonation
good
lacing
with
fine
bubbles
i
personally
feel
this
a
better
lager
for
the
fall
or
early
spring
rather
then
the
summer
tasty
this
beer
was
otherwise
ordinary
but
the
consistency
merits
giving
it
really
high
marks
o
a
nice
and
drinkable
beer
not
as
good
as
a
great
pilsener
but
still
a
refreshing
alternative
like
a
pale
ale
with
tasty
meaty
food
i
think
id
really
enjoy
this
at
a
bbq
o
good
solid
beer
to
have
on
hand
this
is
an
unusually
complex
and
drinkable
lager
not
even
comparable
to
the
usual
adjuncts
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
style
a
real
winner
o
pretty
good
especially
for
the
style
but
not
something
id
probably
buy
twice
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
lager
lol
its
surely
maltier
than
most
lagers
and
represents
the
listed
style
well
but
id
much
more
appreciative
if
the
finish
was
cleaned
up
a
little
this
would
certainly
stand
up
better
to
bbq
than
its
lighter
cousin
overall
a
decent
beer
but
im
not
sure
ill
go
for
it
again
brooklyn
lager
is
a
nice
tasty
lager
flavorful
and
hoppy
for
the
style
wasnt
expecting
this
from
a
lager
i
was
a
little
disappointed
because
i
thought
it
would
have
been
similar
to
a
samuel
adams
which
has
a
better
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
in
my
opinion
a
sam
adams
is
a
much
better
beer
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
one
to
sit
with
for
an
afternoon
could
use
more
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
subdued
beer
nice
and
light
across
the
pallatte
i
get
sweetness
from
the
start
and
it
got
stronger
as
the
beer
warmed
it
had
a
clean
flavor
without
any
bitterness
this
really
hit
the
spot
for
an
outdoor
barbeque
overall
a
good
lager
with
a
nice
bready
sweetness
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
hop
flavor
very
balanced
something
nice
to
have
once
in
awhile
and
great
for
any
time
that
causes
for
cans
we
dont
get
enough
cans
around
here
so
this
is
a
top
choice
for
something
like
that
overall
one
of
the
better
lagers
which
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
genres
but
i
am
still
impressed
with
this
one
o
very
enjoyable
overall
pretty
good
lighter
but
full
flavor
light
malts
could
have
added
a
bit
more
of
the
lager
flavors
and
crisp
drier
finish
but
a
nice
beer
overall
o
a
nice
lager
would
be
great
for
someone
trying
to
show
a
noncraft
beer
drinking
something
familiar
but
superior
pours
a
crystal
clear
very
light
copper
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
cerealgrainscaramel
and
medicinal
hopsthe
mouthfeel
is
just
above
light
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
barleybrown
sugarsticky
date
puddingprunes
and
finished
with
a
bittersweet
toffee
twist
and
overall
not
a
bad
drop
and
easy
to
knock
back
but
nothing
over
the
top
by
any
means
cheers
o
the
lack
of
carbonation
was
a
little
strange
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
true
to
label
as
ive
found
from
everything
ive
come
across
from
these
guys
that
is
one
nice
beer
so
glad
that
weve
finally
got
access
to
it
in
australia
would
love
to
try
it
brewery
fresh
one
day
notes
a
nice
solid
beer
very
sessionable
really
quite
lovely
this
is
the
kind
of
lager
that
all
american
brewers
should
make
is
it
more
expensive
to
make
it
this
well
this
is
probably
the
smoothest
lager
around
incredibly
easy
going
down
the
taste
is
unlike
any
of
your
macro
beers
and
blows
a
lot
of
craft
lagers
away
this
is
very
tasty
in
a
can
the
beer
poured
a
copper
color
more
light
and
amberish
very
biscuity
and
malty
in
the
nose
caramel
notes
as
well
taste
has
a
nice
hop
bite
somewhat
englishy
but
more
malty
and
biscuity
nice
mouthfeel
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
will
always
have
love
for
this
beer
even
though
it
is
not
the
greatest
that
i
have
ever
had
still
a
great
example
of
the
style
reviewed
from
notes
poured
into
pint
glass
scent
of
hops
from
bottle
pours
a
18
head
on
top
of
reddishcaramel
color
malty
wa
slight
hoppiness
strong
flavor
nice
full
mouthfeel
wa
balanced
finish
seems
stronger
then
the
abv
listed
another
solid
entry
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
unless
it
was
on
sale
i
mean
its
a
typical
boring
lager
brooklyn
makes
a
lot
better
beers
than
this
its
just
okay
the
taste
is
just
excellent
a
slight
hop
punch
hidden
by
the
delicious
malts
and
caramel
flavor
it
tastes
a
lot
bolder
than
its
alcohol
by
volume
i
cant
believe
ive
never
tried
this
because
i
love
it
i
buy
this
beer
a
lot
its
one
of
my
goto
beers
i
think
its
a
very
well
crafted
beer
thats
easy
to
enjoy
a
good
step
up
from
your
run
of
the
mill
lagers
overallgreat
session
beer
highly
drinkable
with
some
very
nice
flavors
nothing
over
the
top
by
any
means
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
beer
again
also
very
reasonable
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
flavorful
well
balanced
lager
i
will
buy
again
to
sample
at
my
house
properly
at
a
later
date
in
my
sam
adams
pint
glass
like
most
of
my
other
samplings
o
highly
drinkable
o
a
very
clean
lager
with
a
bite
of
hop
bitterness
to
finish
it
off
nothing
very
spectacular
and
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
love
for
lager
but
moving
on
d
i
wouldnt
really
consider
this
an
american
amber
lager
but
more
of
an
english
just
sort
of
a
malty
onenote
lager
looking
for
more
the
body
feels
a
litle
syrupy
and
heavy
for
the
style
otherwise
pretty
good
i
cracked
it
open
assuming
it
was
more
of
a
pale
lager
so
i
was
kinda
surprised
i
dont
tend
to
love
amber
ales
or
lagers
and
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
but
its
certainly
not
bad
and
as
i
continue
through
brooklyns
selections
i
continue
to
like
what
im
seeing
from
them
o
this
is
still
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
lagers
simple
straight
forward
and
delicious
these
are
excellent
for
summer
and
are
extremely
refreshing
httpabarwithnoname

com
the
aroma
was
striking
me
as
odd
when
i
leaned
in
but
no
so
much
really
in
a
bad
way
but
rather
just
a
touch
different
then
what
i
was
expecting
it
had
a
big
malt
character
to
it
with
lots
of
wet
grass
and
earthy
musky
smells
coming
through
on
it
however
if
you
looked
inside
a
little
deeper
what
you
found
was
a
very
nice
and
light
citrus
notethis
was
a
highly
drinkable
session
ale
for
me
and
i
am
not
sure
what
the
percentage
is
here
but
it
cannot
be
that
high
really
a
very
nice
drinker
with
a
nice
light
body
and
a
smooth
creamy
finish
with
more
then
adequate
carbonation
the
flavor
was
light
enough
to
not
really
overpower
in
one
direction
or
the
other
but
at
the
same
time
it
also
had
more
then
enough
going
for
it
to
keep
you
interested
throughout
nice
bready
malts
popping
up
for
me
first
really
earthy
grainy
like
flavor
but
this
was
soon
passed
up
by
a
nice
bright
spot
of
floral
hops
really
nicely
balanced
not
sure
what
to
call
the
style
other
then
a
nice
american
lager
a
touch
sweet
on
the
finish
before
drying
out
and
getting
you
ready
for
the
next
sip
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
with
no
head
or
lace
its
aroma
is
of
fruit
bread
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
fruity
with
sweet
malt
notes
followed
by
a
hop
bitterness
that
lasts
from
start
to
finish
the
flavor
is
more
reminiscent
of
an
apa
than
a
lager
and
leaves
a
lasting
dry
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
brooklyn
lager
is
a
mediochre
beer
not
recommended
very
enjoyable
brew
this
would
be
a
good
canned
beer
for
a
fishin
trip
or
day
at
the
beach
this
is
an
old
favorite
of
mine
a
high
quality
easy
drinking
beer
thats
priced
right
and
commonly
found
around
where
i
live
in
ohio
o
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
something
you
can
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
mouthfeel
is
very
good
smooth
nice
amount
of
bubbles
overall
a
very
drinkable
lager
simple
to
be
sure
but
still
very
crisp
and
easy
to
like
o
crisp
refreshing
easy
drinking
a
nice
lager
another
newtominnesota
beer
i
thought
this
was
a
pale
lager
when
i
bought
it
but
find
that
it
is
an
amber
lager
not
my
favorite
flavor
combination
but
ill
still
try
the
other
brooklyn
beers
ive
never
had
another
lager
quite
like
this
with
its
solid
hop
presence
id
love
to
see
more
overall
a
nice
beer
its
flavorful
but
light
enough
that
it
refreshing
and
drinkable
very
clean
finish
with
residual
maltiness
i
think
this
is
a
great
allaround
beer
less
american
style
more
s
german
style
dr
abv
is
disguised
contrary
to
the
smell
of
the
beer
the
major
flaw
is
the
price
give
it
a
go
overall
a
very
solid
lager
one
of
the
best
american
lagers
ive
had
bronzed
color
nice
lacing
nice
malt
forward
lager
but
hops
are
not
short
changed
either
maltiness
is
light
caramel
hops
floral
and
earthy
this
lager
has
some
character
retains
its
drinkability
level
nicely
reminds
me
some
of
sammy
boston
lager
nicely
done
great
bbq
beer
crisp
light
side
of
medium
bodied
overall
a
good
beer
especially
for
someone
new
to
craft
brews
and
more
acquainted
with
adjunct
lagers
overall
i
like
that
this
has
more
of
a
roasted
character
than
other
lagers
ive
had
the
slighly
amped
up
hoppiness
also
saves
this
from
being
too
easydrinking
m
d
very
light
and
crisp
nice
carbonation
this
one
was
designed
to
appeal
to
the
masses
very
wellbalanced
but
nothing
extremely
exciting
i
would
certainly
try
another
overall
brooklyn
lager
is
a
clean
refreshing
easytodrink
beer
light
to
moderatebodied
and
pretty
darn
tasty
this
is
a
beer
that
could
be
paired
with
just
about
any
cuisine
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
aftertaste
has
floral
hop
bitterness
a
nice
amber
lager
it
does
nothing
to
blow
my
mind
but
is
a
solid
offering
poured
a
2
5
head
which
took
a
while
to
settle
down
lots
of
effervescence
in
the
glass
dark
amber
color
otherwise
both
the
smell
and
taste
could
have
been
most
any
other
american
lager
so
to
me
this
is
a
really
good
looking
version
of
the
same
old
thing
but
i
love
lots
of
brooklyns
other
specialty
beers
and
this
one
is
clearly
a
mass
production
version
o
there
is
nothing
interesting
about
this
beer
to
me
and
i
would
not
recommend
it
overall
quite
nice
brooklyn
lager
is
really
starting
to
grow
on
me
it
was
one
of
the
earliest
craft
beers
and
i
remember
not
liking
it
at
all
in
the
span
of
a
month
ive
had
it
in
the
can
and
on
tap
and
both
have
really
impressed
me
think
a
more
hoppy
flavorful
boston
lager
and
you
have
brooklyn
lager
certain
worth
a
try
the
mouth
is
good
and
very
appropriate
to
style
with
the
level
of
carbonation
and
body
overall
the
beer
is
good
and
very
drinkable
nice
work
from
brooklyn
o
this
is
the
flagship
brew
for
brooklyn
its
pretty
tasty
well
made
but
i
dont
see
buying
alot
of
this
one
i
will
drink
it
again
for
sure
but
only
in
single
or
on
tap
the
beer
pours
a
clear
bronzeamber
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
with
a
really
nice
floral
hop
presence
the
taste
is
very
balanced
with
caramel
and
floral
hops
each
trying
to
dominate
the
other
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
often
overall
other
than
a
couple
pilsners
out
there
this
is
about
as
good
as
an
everyday
lower
alcohol
lager
can
get
this
should
be
bigger
than
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
new
york
is
always
better
than
boston
right
just
kidding
i
am
from
minnesota
and
really
couldnt
care
less
about

rivalry

brooklyn
lager
is
even
better
on
tap
especially
from
a
fresh
cold
keg
the
closer
to
williamsburg
brooklyn
the
better
expect
a
frothier
lacier
maltier
more
complex
experience
and
expect
to
get
to
know
the
bartender
by
first
name
by
the
time
youre
done
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
should
appeal
to
just
about
anyone
sessionable
brew
that
stands
up
to
the
best
of
them
in
the
style
went
out
to
dinner
with
the
mrs
and
some
friends
and
the
brooklyn
lager
was
on
tap
so
i
had
to
partake
the
brooklyn
lager
is
a
amber
in
color
with
thin
clear
head
there
was
not
much
nose
on
this
beer
so
i
really
couldnt
get
too
excited
the
taste
was
a
solid
lager
as
it
warmed
up
it
started
to
remind
me
albeit
very
slightly
a
little
like
samuel
adams
the
mouth
feel
was
decent
and
i
could
session
this
beer
overall
a
really
solid
lager
really
easy
drinking
i
like
this
one
pours
a
clear
amber
tone
with
caronation
evident
medium
fizzy
head
dissipates
quickly
lovely
malt
aroma
mixed
in
with
nice
flowery
aroma
accents
the
beer
has
a
nice
firm
body
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
present
maltiness
is
average
for
european
style
pilsener
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
of
a
bite
this
is
a
decent
brew
however
a
welcome
addition
to
the
selection
in
the
stores
of
the
uk
medium
body
normal
carbonation
a
little
sticky
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
an
awesome
find
at
a
sporting
event
or
random
bar
but
not
something
id
necessarily
buy
or
seek
out
if
that
makes
sense
d
drinkable
mild
amber
lager
d
a
pleasant
clean
drinking
lager
not
quite
as
good
as
sam
adams
boston
lager
imo
overall
a
great
session
beer
one
of
the
best
out
there
good
balance
of
hop
and
malt
character
with
just
the
right
amount
of
body
and
carbonation
mouthfeel
drinkability
as
stated
very
light
bodied
and
packed
with
floral
notes
a
good
overall
lager
but
not
close
to
being
my
favorite
amber
easily
drinkable
in
any
fashion
d
it
goes
down
easily
i
can
see
eating
with
this
beer
certainly
not
a
dessert
unto
itself
id
go
back
for
another
one
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
wasnt
completely
blown
away
i
would
consider
having
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
and
the
price
was
right
d
pretty
drinkable
lager
glad
i
had
tried
it
but
not
overly
impressed
i
wouldnt
seek
this
brew
out
but
glad
i
had
it
d
probably
the
best
amberred
lager
i
have
had
to
date
well
balanced
and
wonderfully
tasty
o
very
easy
to
drink
either
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
d
refreshing
when
warm
less
so
when
warm
but
that
makes
sense
for
the
style
its
basically
a
slightly
more
maltyhoppy
macro
lager
short
on
the
flavor
and
complexity
long
on
the
drinkability
but
then
again
drinkability
isnt
everything
d
this
was
a
different
lager
then
what
ive
ever
had
but
it
was
a
good
different
id
have
no
problem
having
a
bunch
of
these
this
is
a
great
beer
and
is
an
easy
drinker
but
has
a
ton
a
flavor
regardless
this
is
pretty
easy
drinking
with
some
good
qualities
to
be
had
im
very
happy
to
see
this
in
cans
at
last
and
16oz
cans
too
and
at
5
2
its
very
sessionable
d
very
very
drinkable
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
and
its
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
of
all
time
will
be
getting
this
a
lot
in
the
future
pour
yields
a
brew
with
an
amber
body
and
a
pretty
big
offwhite
head
that
leaves
behind
gobs
and
gobs
of
lacing
head
goes
from
a
few
fingers
to
a
nice
stead
halffinger
the
nose
has
some
light
malt
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
nothing
too
complex
but
its
done
well
the
taste
improves
upon
this
with
a
nice
dry
malt
presence
and
a
bit
of
light
earthy
hops
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
seems
to
be
part
hops
and
part
tannins
body
is
light
to
medium
good
carbonation
as
well
drinks
really
quite
well
a
solid
brew
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
wellcrafted
and
sessionworthy
right
on
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
overall
good
beer
overall
this
isnt
something
ill
actively
seek
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
to
me
its
worth
trying
d
this
is
easily
the
best
lager
ive
had
and
it
goes
down
incredibly
easily
this
is
close
to
a
perfect
session
beerlager
a
very
nice
well
balanced
lager
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
bitterness
that
balances
ou
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
possibly
one
of
the
best
lagers
plain
tasting
but
that
is
to
be
expected
of
a
lager
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
drink
it
seems
like
you
can
have
quite
a
few
and
not
really
feel
it
took
a
bottle
of
this
and
poured
it
into
my
all
purpose
handydandy
glass
and
see
a
medium
amber
body
with
a
light
creamy
tan
head
the
scent
is
full
of
grapefruit
and
the
foam
head
tastes
more
like
grapefruit
juice
than
beer
the
taste
is
long
on
citrusy
hops
with
a
short
start
of
light
toasted
malts
it
feels
good
in
the
mouth
not
thin
or
watery
but
still
light
with
a
touch
of
limgering
creaminess
slightly
hoppier
than
i
prefer
but
very
good
and
i
can
honestly
say
its
very
tasty
and
would
probably
be
a
good
brew
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
problem
with
this
particular
beer
it
was
a
little
past
its
prime
a
little
flat
in
initial
smell
overall
great
beer
d
not
a
ton
going
on
in
this
beer
but
a
nice
all
around
lager
overall
seems
i
havent
found
a
brooklyn
beer
i
love
gonna
keep
trying
though
d
drinks
clean
and
crisp
can
pair
with
just
about
anything
for
your
buck
a
great
deal
drinkability
refreshing
goes
down
easily
pleasant
but
not
spectacular
a
good
solid
lager
for
any
occasion
much
better
then
bmc
on
par
with
sam
adams
boston
lager
pours
a
clear
amber
orange
with
a
bit
of
whitehead
a
bit
of
nice
lacing
smells
malty
and
good
honestly
a
better
smell
than
i
was
expecting
tastes
really
malty
and
smooth
a
bit
of
hoppiness
on
the
forefront
but
very
balanced
very
well
carbonated
crisp
and
smooth
honestly
way
tastier
than
expected
so
this
is
the
brooklyn
lager
eh
seen
it
zillions
of
times
but
this
is
my
first
meeting
i
like
it
its
solid
and
it
has
a
good
bit
of
personality
that
makes
it
stand
out
just
enough
to
recommend
d
very
easy
going
down
even
a
6
pack
is
gone
very
fast
by
myself
d
absolutely
one
of
the
most
perfectly
balanced
and
flavoral
beers
available
this
is
about
as
pleasureable
and
drinkable
beer
there
is
brooklyn
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
one
for
my
money
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
i
have
had
this
beer
a
number
of
times
but
i
have
never
felt
compelled
to
review
it
i
heard
it
was
good
but
i
have
never
found
it
remarkable
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
definitely
other
flavorful
lagers
out
there
d
not
bad
a
good
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
for
a
long
while
without
it
getting
overpowering
great
job
once
again
its
really
nice
to
have
brooklyn
distributing
here
i
just
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
a
little
easier
d
the
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
it
is
a
great
tasting
lager
i
think
i
would
choose
this
over
any
lager
ive
had
in
the
past
i
think
brooklyn
brewery
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
this
beer
again
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
there
is
good
balanced
flavor
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
again
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
to
a
16oz
pint
glass
the
appearance
is
one
you
would
expect
from
an
amber
lager
reddish
gold
transparent
tint
with
a
frothy
white
head
on
top
smells
delicious
and
tastes
delicious
smooth
sweet
caramel
flavor
with
a
big
malty
finish
very
good
session
beer
ill
probably
drink
its
5
other
buddies
tonight
yum
ive
heard
good
things
about
brooklyn
brewery
so
i
was
a
little
bit
disappointed
with
this
offering
its
certainly
not
bad
but
theres
nothing
special
about
it
pretty
drinkable
but
not
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
it
d
a
very
flavourful
offering
and
a
pleasure
to
see
on
tap
at
the
local
irish
pub
easily
sessionable
with
a
nice
hopmalt
balance
likely
a
goto
offering
at
this
establishment
in
the
future
76
i
went
through
5
gallons
on
my
home
tap
and
i
checked
the
labeling
multiple
times
to
make
sure
that
i
had
the
right
beer
if
it
wasnt
so
clearly
marked
i
could
have
sworn
that
this
was
a
pale
ale
or
even
an
ipa
the
beer
pours
with
a
deep
yellowamber
color
and
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
much
more
hopforward
than
expected
with
prominent
notes
of
grapefruit
and
grass
but
there
is
also
a
substantial
caramel
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
seemed
even
more
offstyle
with
a
much
more
resinous
texture
and
little
of
the
crispness
i
expected
and
desired
from
a
lager
even
from
an
american
amber
lager
overall
it
was
different
interesting
and
quite
unexpected
but
it
was
just
too
far
from
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
good
lager
drink
i
drink
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
an
above
average
beer
that
never
lets
me
down
has
a
nice
fruity
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
has
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
about
a
one
finger
head
that
laces
nicely
has
a
int
of
hops
with
bitter
bite
that
fades
quickly
the
taste
seems
intimating
at
first
but
then
seems
to
mellow
carbonation
has
a
nice
zing
to
it
not
a
bad
beer
overall
that
seems
to
have
a
nice
balance
to
it
im
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
but
i
would
refuse
one
if
offered
taste
little
bitter
yet
had
some
sweetness
to
it
also
maltycitrusyhoppy
smooth
but
well
carbonated
good
drinkability
i
really
wish
i
could
get
this
locally
i
hear
its
affordable
great
hop
flavors
drinkability
another
enjoyable
beer
that
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
i
truly
think
this
is
a
beer
i
would
stock
and
share
with
friends
d
it
is
slightly
less
smooth
and
crisp
than
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
12
oz
bottle
the
beer
is
amber
in
color
with
anice
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
of
bread
with
a
touch
of
hops
hops
hit
you
right
away
almost
ipa
like
and
linger
for
a
while
sweet
malt
is
muted
compared
to
hops
too
hoppy
for
vienna
but
great
lager
nevertheless
drinkability
unique
lager
with
its
larger
hop
influence
fresh
tasting
ingredients
makes
for
a
good
casual
drinking
beer
d
fairly
drinkable
but
not
too
flavorful
rjt
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
smaller
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
lot
of
biscuit
malt
with
some
floral
and
fruity
notes
the
flavor
is
biscuit
malt
flowers
grassy
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
fruit
the
beer
is
very
clean
tasting
and
very
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
drinkable
enough
though
ill
select
this
beer
again
at
bars
that
have
it
on
tap
when
its
only
up
against
a
few
other
beers
but
its
hardly
going
to
win
me
over
when
im
staring
at
a
store
shelf
full
of
selection
d
pretty
bland
not
my
cup
of
beer
id
probably
rather
have
one
of
the
better
american
adjunct
lager
over
this
poor
head
of
less
than
a
finger
and
went
poof
in
about
15
seconds
lace
is
splochy
and
no
cling
color
is
a
8
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smells
like
barley
and
wet
wheat
tastes
are
roasted
wheat
malt
and
yeast
mouthfeel
is
adequate
but
nothing
special
just
does
not
have
much
going
for
flavor
just
sort
of
sends
me
the
wrong
way
d
this
was
a
very
impressive
lager
i
was
really
surprised
by
the
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
of
this
beer
the
brewers
of
brooklyn
have
done
a
wonderful
job
balancing
the
malt
and
hops
will
have
it
again
for
sure
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
nice
white
lasting
head
aroma
of
fruity
floral
hops
with
some
malt
taste
is
toasted
malts
with
some
light
bitter
hops
nice
medium
body
crisp
mouth
feel
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
toasted
sweet
malts
with
some
bitter
hops
there
is
a
lingering
nutty
malty
ending
overall
a
very
good
refreshing
easy
drinking
and
mellow
lager
much
darker
than
your
average
lager
it
is
dull
amber
and
looks
and
tastes
almost
identical
to
anchor
steam
anchor
steam
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
so
in
my
opinion
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
even
if
hackneyed
from
the
original
the
smell
is
subdued
a
bit
earthy
with
slight
nuttiness
and
faint
caramel
the
taste
is
great
mellow
fruit
rich
walnut
slight
floral
hints
at
the
edges
clean
malt
with
a
dry
hop
finish
that
is
nearly
perfect
it
is
a
heavier
beer
than
a
macro
lager
but
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
little
extra
heft
there
is
a
crisp
hop
dryness
at
the
finish
which
is
sublime
this
was
an
instant
favorite
when
i
tried
it
at
roscoe
village
tap
last
summer
and
in
six
pack
form
it
is
excellent
highly
recommended
but
i
do
question
the
authenticity
of
their
recipe
because
this
is
a
near
match
to
anchor
steam
in
color
flavor
and
body
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
on
draft
w
a
good
pizza
is
an
unbeatable
combo
d
this
is
a
quality
brew
from
one
of
the
companies
that
started
the
movement
the
taste
was
a
fine
balance
of
the
sweetness
of
caramel
brown
bread
backed
by
a
heady
array
of
floral
and
slightly
citric
hops
i
can
swear
that
i
have
never
experienced
this
quantum
of
hoppy
juiciness
in
a
lager
before
very
surprising
and
very
enjoyable
the
body
was
rather
a
little
oily
that
prefer
my
lagers
and
a
hoppy
one
at
that
to
be
a
little
bouncy
although
it
was
well
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
was
slicker
than
what
id
prefer
but
this
in
no
way
hampered
its
drinkability
i
could
easily
have
a
few
without
batting
an
eyelid
its
enjoyable
and
light
on
your
gut
overall
a
great
beer
to
crack
open
any
time
of
the
year
drinkability
hop
and
malt
balance
was
good
good
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
an
excellent
choice
for
the
hophead
who
wants
something
a
bit
lighter
and
less
aggressive
than
the
ipas
of
the
world
dquite
drinkable
oh
only
if
this
was
how
most
lagers
tasted
good
beer
solid
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
not
the
typical
larger
as
it
was
much
more
red
than
i
expected
but
is
fit
the
style
perfectly
and
it
really
a
start
of
the
red
larger
category
this
is
recommended
for
both
the
enthusist
and
the
every
day
beer
drinker
a
pleasant
enough
generally
lively
allmalt
lager
this
seems
to
be
a
proper
gobetween
amongst
bmcs
best
fauxcraft
offerings
and
the
headiest
of
neogerman
brewing
provocateurs
active
in
those
united
states
tasty
and
just
the
sort
of
thing
one
might
slam
a
sixer
of
without
moral
sidesteps
during
yer
best
backyard
bbqs
of
the
season
its
a
very
nice
lager
lots
of
good
hop
flavor
taste
starts
with
moderate
maltiness
some
lemony
notes
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
pine
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
easy
all
around
enjoyable
brew
that
sessions
with
ease
cloudy
in
appearance
with
a
deep
golden
color
head
is
a
thick
white
foam
with
lots
of
staying
power
citrusy
hop
aroma
biscuity
malt
flavor
with
lots
of
citrusy
and
spicy
hop
flavor
tastes
like
cascade
hops
mixed
with
continental
noble
hops
im
not
crazy
about
the
citrus
hop
flavor
in
a
medium
bodies
lager
in
my
opinion
this
would
work
better
with
a
little
more
malt
presence
and
alcohol
strength
pours
a
good
copper
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
smells
of
hop
fragrance
and
some
malts
tastes
more
of
hops
than
your
general
lager
but
is
mellowed
out
by
tasty
malts
that
add
a
slightly
honey
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
average
somewhat
thin
highly
drinkable
for
beer
lovers
and
beer
novices
alike
i
didnt
love
the
smell
all
i
got
was
yeast
with
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
was
lovely
citrusses
hops
that
fade
into
a
mellow
honey
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
great
medium
body
i
was
surprised
how
thick
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
it
went
down
well
i
vastly
prefer
this
over
boston
lager
might
be
the
hop
profile
or
just
the
bigger
nose
and
lighter
body
but
brooklyn
lager
is
a
winner
and
i
now
understand
why
its
their
flagship
foamy
agreeable
mouthfeel
exceptional
drinkabiliy
if
this
is
indeed
what
our
preprohibition
forebears
routinely
drank
they
are
to
be
envied
at
least
on
that
score
you
almost
forget
that
youre
drinking
a
lager
it
has
a
tea
like
quality
wonderful
citrus
aftertaste
a
very
nice
lager
and
a
refreshing
accessible
beer
seems
to
fill
the
same
niche
that
sa
boston
lager
does
a
nice
balanced
lager
with
some
hop
presence
good
for
breaking
in
a
craft
newbie
or
enjoying
with
a
meal
or
with
friends
highly
recommended
highly
drinkable
lager
a
standout
in
the
category
very
clean
and
balanced
hoppy
lager
will
enjoy
again
in
the
future
mfd
nothing
special
in
the
mouth
neither
heavy
or
light
a
great
sessionable
summer
afternoon
beer
one
of
my
favourite
lagers
available
at
the
lcbo
provides
a
nice
splash
of
hops
that
arent
too
overpowering
and
is
not
heavy
feeling
at
all
a
perfect
summer
time
session
lager
cheers
great
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
a
perfect
session
beer
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
impression
i
could
defiantly
see
myself
purchasing
a
6er
of
this
it
wasnt
a
knock
out
beer
but
for
a
readily
available
micro
brew
this
was
solid
no
complaints
here
mouthfeel
is
rich
enough
and
crisp
drinkability
is
very
good
goes
down
easy
good
solid
flavor
this
is
what
a
lager
should
be
d
excellent
lager
good
brew
anytime
any
place
not
just
a
hot
weather
lager
i
guess
this
one
has
a
bigger
flavor
profile
than
most
it
is
simple
but
clean
and
effective
dthese
go
down
well
i
could
do
these
as
a
session
beer
no
prob
will
get
again
pics
at
httpwp
mepnkwo7u
yes
as
an
anytime
beer
well
it
looks
and
smells
good
but
im
not
100
into
the
taste
and
feel
miss
a
solid
bitterness
the
sweet
tones
remains
behind
the
bitterness
which
actually
makes
me
more
thirsty
clear
light
amber
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
thin
cap
of
retention
and
tons
of
lacing
the
aromas
are
quite
malty
with
more
toastiness
and
caramel
than
anything
else
something
baked
and
sweet
in
the
aromas
too
biscuit
bordering
on
cookies
flavors
are
mild
more
than
anything
its
a
toasted
biscuit
not
a
lot
of
hoppiness
in
there
that
goes
beyond
bitter
a
slight
astringency
is
killing
the
flavor
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
i
dont
know
if
i
would
recommend
this
one
maybe
to
folks
who
are
newer
to
the
craft
scene
nice
work
mr
oliver
it
would
be
nice
if
the
lagers
produced
in
brazil
were
like
brooklyn
amber
color
like
all
brooklyn
beers
that
ive
tasted
it
has
a
salty
but
nice
flavor
aroma
floral
herbal
citric
and
malts
taste
well
balanced
hops
something
sweet
and
salty
mild
carbonation
high
drinkability
pleasant
bitter
end
clear
amber
color
with
a
solid
two
fingers
of
white
head
that
hung
on
for
a
long
time
the
head
settled
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
quite
the
hoppy
little
lager
we
have
here
floral
and
slightly
citrus
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
a
bready
malt
base
the
hops
play
a
large
role
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
spice
from
the
hops
compliments
the
dry
bready
malt
flavor
i
would
bump
the
score
up
a
bit
if
it
was
a
little
bigger
beer
in
the
malt
department
but
as
it
is
a
good
light
bodied
flavorful
lager
that
is
easy
to
drink
no
surprise
this
is
brooklyn
brewerys
top
selling
beer
d
pretty
solid
and
enjoyable
drink
it
is
what
it
is
great
for
summer
drinking
dbconclusion
refreshing
lager
with
maybe
the
best
lager
flavor
i
have
come
across
well
balanced
and
smooth
could
be
a
great
session
beer
great
example
of
the
style
an
american
classic
for
the
style
this
is
what
it
should
be
folks
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
pale
orange
with
a
decent
diminishing
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
trace
of
lacing
on
the
top
of
the
glass
aroma
is
pale
malts
and
mild
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
malta
in
front
of
a
nice
citrus
hops
backbone
that
leaves
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
quite
light
smooth
and
refreshing
ill
admit
i
didnt
expect
much
when
i
ordered
this
one
but
it
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
not
incredibly
complex
but
i
really
dont
think
thats
what
they
were
going
for
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
on
a
regular
basis
but
definitely
wouldnt
complain
if
it
were
the
only
option
at
a
backyard
barbecue
or
in
a
similar
setting
honestly
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
lagers
out
there
and
a
prime
example
of
how
they
should
be
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
my
overall
impression
at
this
sitting
was
unremarkable
but
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
right
out
of
the
bottle
too
d
this
is
a
delicious
beer
easy
to
drink
with
enough
body
and
girth
to
make
it
feel
like
youre
drinking
something
substantial
o
really
nice
lager
but
could
be
better
d
i
could
easily
session
this
baby
good
does
of
hops
and
the
regulation
abv
makes
this
a
decent
lager
poured
copperamber
with
a
heavy
dose
of
carbonation
two
fingers
of
white
good
head
retention
and
good
lacing
smelled
of
biscuit
malt
pear
grass
and
herbal
hops
nice
to
see
what
a
good
lager
is
capable
of
smelling
like
the
taste
yielded
a
nicely
balanced
herbalgrassymalty
mix
that
progressed
to
a
crisp
dry
finish
and
left
malty
hints
afterwards
more
pear
fruitiness
was
revealed
as
it
warmed
towards
room
temperature
the
mouthfeel
was
a
perfectly
carbonated
medium
body
an
excellent
session
lager
the
beer
pours
golden
brown
with
a
thick
half
inch
white
head
the
first
sip
brings
a
malty
flavor
a
bit
sour
but
refreshing
drinks
fast
without
a
hint
of
alcohol
a
good
lager
for
a
summer
afternoon
bbq
when
sam
adams
goes
sweet
this
goes
bitter
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
clear
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
smells
of
citrus
fruit
peel
taste
is
a
light
caramel
sweetness
followed
by
a
very
herbal
earthy
floral
hop
flavor
and
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
so
is
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
i
could
drink
several
a
nice
refreshing
beer
d
yes
sir
pour
me
another
i
like
this
beer
it
may
well
become
a
staple
in
my
household
like
i
said
it
is
the
sweet
and
sour
of
the
beer
world
i
want
to
drink
it
with
chinese
food
d
not
bad
but
the
hops
get
a
little
heavy
after
a
couple
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
recipe
wasnt
developed
as
a
match
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
it
is
nearly
identical
in
profile
save
for
being
a
little
heavier
in
body
drinkability
i
really
like
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
at
any
time
during
the
year
not
real
heavy
good
all
around
beer
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
drinkability
probably
my
favorite
of
brooklyns
party
mix
pack
a
good
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
lager
a
beer
lighter
on
hops
but
with
very
refined
malt
flavors
worth
a
taste
d
a
nice
sessionable
lager
well
balanced
and
easy
on
the
palate
d
this
is
a
very
good
lager
one
of
my
favorites
actually
this
is
a
great
beer
for
hanging
around
the
grill
or
just
making
a
night
of
it
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
solid
amber
ale
have
had
many
times
again
and
something
i
will
definitely
buy
again
d
an
excellent
lager
easy
drinking
yet
still
has
a
nice
full
flavour
a
good
summer
beer
and
would
be
a
good
any
time
beer
this
is
only
the
second
beer
ive
tried
from
brooklyn
the
first
being
the
chocolate
stout
and
i
was
quite
impressed
with
that
wish
i
could
get
more
up
in
canada
but
it
is
what
is
an
east
coast
classic
glad
to
see
brooklyn
add
cans
to
their
portfolio
d
easy
to
drink
more
so
than
most
beers
i
like
this
beer
and
recommend
it
highly
its
great
looking
with
a
unique
flavor
profile
to
me
and
is
so
very
drinkable
i
think
this
is
my
third
6pack
in
2
or
3
months
i
look
forward
to
trying
brooklyns
other
beers
di
really
like
this
brew
a
lot
easy
drinking
but
sophisticated
enough
where
im
still
interested
in
the
beer
very
nice
effort
from
brooklyn
brooklyn
lager
appears
a
slightly
dark
brown
shade
atop
the
beer
rests
a
small
head
that
fades
after
a
few
moments
leaving
no
trace
on
the
glass
aromas
are
fairly
weak
though
i
dont
expect
huge
scents
from
a
session
lager
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
and
light
with
a
hearty
malt
backbone
that
gives
the
beer
a
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
a
good
lighter
abv
beer
overall
quite
drinkable
a
beer
that
goes
well
with
a
game
of
cornhole
notes
a
really
solid
american
craft
lager
i
do
not
pick
up
any
factors
that
could
be
explained
by
the
idea
that
it
was
from
a
can
metalic
taste
etc
draft
at
the
distillery
rochester
ny
very
light
aroma
nice
deep
amber
color
with
nice
lacing
small
tan
head
wonderful
flavor
of
fruit
mixed
with
hops
medium
body
with
a
slightly
bitter
twang
to
it
the
finish
is
smooth
with
very
little
aftertaste
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
it
but
i
was
surprised
and
pleased
d
this
goes
down
easy
definitely
wouldnt
turn
one
down
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
have
had
dit
was
what
i
was
told
it
would
be
a
malty
lager
not
a
bad
beer
overall
although
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
for
more
pours
a
clean
yellow
to
copper
color
with
a
big
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweeter
malt
and
small
saaz
pilsner
hops
in
the
taste
a
smooth
sweet
maltiness
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dryness
yet
mainly
clean
aftertaste
a
nice
lager
nice
body
clean
and
fresh
d
a
fabulous
looking
brew
that
really
doesnt
live
up
to
its
presentation
this
one
isnt
anything
special
beyond
its
appearance
not
quenching
fruity
or
hoppy
but
rather
just
kind
of
bland
in
a
mundane
metallic
sort
of
way
a
bit
too
overcarbonated
also
widely
available
so
ill
drink
it
if
its
the
only
thing
offered
but
really
nothing
to
write
home
or
even
get
excited
about
910
beers
i
buy
are
ales
because
my
experience
with
lagers
has
been
pretty
lackluster
this
really
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
d
drinkablity
is
great
and
easy
at
that
its
a
drinker
and
alot
of
at
that
cheers
brooklyn
lager
pours
a
deep
red
in
my
duvel
tulip
halfway
to
brown
the
head
is
off
white
with
just
a
hint
of
tan
mixed
in
and
is
impressive
both
in
size
2
fingers
and
staying
power
and
lacing
the
nose
is
a
mixture
of
biscuity
malts
and
floral
and
earthy
hops
as
i
sip
on
brooklyn
lager
i
immediately
pick
up
on
the
biscuity
malt
flavor
again
before
a
brief
flash
of
bitterness
signals
the
arrival
of
the
hop
flavors
still
earthy
and
floral
i
still
cant
detect
the
cascade
hops
that
went
into
this
beer
the
beer
closes
with
a
caramel
flourish
but
somehow
all
the
pieces
here
just
dont
work
together
like
they
do
in
many
of
my
favorite
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
average
but
the
carbonation
doesnt
seem
to
last
with
each
sip
and
gives
the
impression
that
its
a
bit
lacking
brooklyn
lager
is
a
serviceable
beer
but
doesnt
compare
to
some
of
the
brewerys
more
exciting
beers
a
solid
solid
beer
pouring
a
clear
amber
with
a
dense
light
brown
head
with
decent
retention
theres
not
much
lace
the
nose
is
solid
a
moderate
hop
character
is
present
earthy
and
leafy
with
a
robust
malt
backbone
with
aromas
of
toast
caramel
and
a
little
bread
as
well
the
palate
opens
a
blend
of
moderate
earthy
hop
character
with
a
good
balance
between
the
flavor
and
bitterness
and
a
robust
malt
character
toasty
a
little
bready
and
with
some
caramel
im
rather
surprised
by
the
moderate
fruit
character
as
well
with
a
light
ripe
fruits
while
not
unwelcome
it
is
unconventional
drying
and
hoppy
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
im
glad
this
is
available
in
cans
now
if
its
a
hot
day
and
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
malty
beer
go
for
this
even
though
its
so
well
balanced
i
could
drink
this
year
round
a
solid
standby
a
lager
with
the
feel
of
a
pale
but
without
the
loss
in
light
body
nice
thought
it
was
a
mild
english
pale
at
first
but
clear
orange
nice
head
some
lace
nice
of
sun
tea
sweetened
with
honey
a
bit
of
pollen
flower
palate
is
like
but
full
a
good
beer
to
have
in
the
summer
for
sure
d
very
drinkable
the
wife
and
i
are
big
fans
of
this
beer
weve
been
discussing
grabbing
this
next
year
for
our
summer
beer
the
drinkability
is
very
good
and
even
though
ive
only
had
this
beer
a
few
times
its
become
one
of
my
favorites
there
are
quite
a
few
bland
lagers
on
the
market
but
this
problem
is
especially
bad
where
i
live
in
japan
because
lager
is
the
dominant
style
for
the
major
domestic
brewers
its
refreshing
to
have
one
like
this
which
actually
offers
up
some
complexity
and
taste
to
chew
on
nice
lipsmacking
malty
mouthfeel
solid
carbonation
feels
smooth
and
invigorating
going
down
yessir
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
drinkability
this
is
my
new
go
to
everyday
beer
light
and
easy
drinking
with
tons
of
flavor
move
over
yuengling
overall
its
a
solid
lager
probably
my
go
to
lager
bc
local
always
wins
this
is
definitely
my
beer
of
choice
when
faced
with
a
bank
of
lagers
and
big
names
absolutely
will
drink
again
drink
as
drinkable
as
any
other
amber
maybe
a
bit
moreso
due
to
the
presence
of
a
few
nice
flavors
one
of
my
fondest
days
was
when
i
got
to
meet
garrett
oliver
at
a
beer
tasting
and
ask
him
his
brewing
philosophy
he
said
that
one
of
the
things
he
keeps
in
the
forefront
of
his
mind
when
he
tastes
a
beer
is
whether
or
not
the
beer
exhausts
the
palate
it
can
be
the
most
interesting
single
sip
in
the
world
but
if
you
cant
finish
the
beer
he
isnt
interested
mission
accomplished
on
this
one
extremely
drinkable
full
flavored
lager
ive
always
seen
this
lager
posted
on
bar
menus
in
nj
so
i
finally
decided
to
try
a
taste
last
weekend
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
color
and
smell
coloring
of
the
beer
was
a
dark
medium
brown
darker
than
yuengling
and
lighter
than
sam
adams
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
gave
it
a
nice
floral
aroma
my
palate
was
impressed
with
a
really
nice
balance
of
flavors
this
beer
is
not
overpowering
and
complements
pizza
very
well
i
would
recommend
brooklyn
lager
over
sam
adams
boston
lager
any
day
of
the
week
two
thumbs
up
over
here
for
this
beer
its
definably
sessionable
nice
pale
orange
color
frothy
white
head
with
a
surprising
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
mostly
pils
like
malts
and
grassy
hops
a
fairly
strong
nose
on
this
one
clean
pale
and
pils
malts
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
before
a
bitter
drying
finish
a
little
earthy
grassiness
from
the
hops
a
nice
full
body
for
a
lager
with
crisp
carbonation
and
a
good
clean
dry
finish
a
great
feel
that
helps
this
beer
slide
down
extra
smooth
d
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
but
will
definitely
have
more
of
these
bought
this
one
as
a
single
from
total
wine
more
but
will
have
a
6pack
or
more
next
goround
great
allarounder
i
checked
out
their
website
looks
like
a
nice
bunch
of
people
runningworking
at
the
place
i
also
see
their
other
creations
are
very
well
rated
i
may
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
d
this
is
an
average
beer
but
it
is
way
better
than
most
other
amber
lagers
around
its
great
for
a
warm
weather
session
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
around
a
bbq
md
i
like
brooklyn
this
is
an
easy
going
beer
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
beer
to
bring
to
a
bbq
it
would
be
something
most
people
would
enjoy
dgood
drinkability
because
of
smoothness
fantastic
lager
poured
from
my
growler
a
golden
amber
color
with
about
2
inches
of
tan
foamy
head
faint
smells
of
roasted
nuts
but
mostly
malts
caramel
flavors
candied
malts
and
a
faint
bit
of
hops
flavor
is
very
drinkable
nothing
to
special
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
very
good
drinkability
another
wellrounded
beer
that
drinks
easily
once
served
in
my
club
america
mug
look
bright
amber
color
fat
foamy
head
acceptable
duration
and
good
lacing
smell
biscuity
malts
and
floral
hops
taste
biscuity
malt
and
semi
roasted
malt
a
background
of
floral
hops
and
grains
the
malt
character
dominates
mouthfeel
dry
crisp
medium
bitterness
medium
to
robust
body
somewhat
creamy
drinkability
nothing
to
criticize
probably
the
best
red
lager
i
drank
not
a
bad
lager
not
a
great
lager
certainly
way
better
than
most
of
the
selection
around
here
kinda
a
toss
up
between
this
or
creemore
my
conclusion
is
this
if
youre
stuck
in
a
room
with
the
big
brands
or
a
bottle
of
this
you
take
this
but
if
you
had
a
craft
beer
selection
then
you
dont
pick
this
sinkability
well
i
couldnt
really
pour
this
in
the
sink
because
i
was
at
the
pub
but
i
was
drinking
it
so
slow
that
the
barmaid
came
over
while
i
still
had
half
a
pint
left
and
asked
me
if
i
wanted
something
else
i
have
had
so
many
good
beers
from
this
brewery
its
hard
to
believe
that
this
came
from
the
same
place
i
would
have
no
problems
keeping
a
6pk
of
this
handy
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
with
decent
retention
leaves
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
fairly
mild
with
citrus
and
floral
hops
and
a
tiny
bit
of
sweet
malt
the
malt
is
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
and
nicely
balanced
with
the
hops
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
good
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
this
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
this
didnt
taste
like
a
typical
lager
but
regardless
this
is
a
very
good
beer
lots
o
hops
for
a
lager
from
my
experience
this
is
a
bit
different
than
most
others
ive
had
orange
amber
in
color
with
some
lacing
it
has
a
strong
floral
hop
aroma
on
the
pour
the
upfront
flavor
is
similar
to
the
smell
floralherbal
hops
has
a
malt
backbone
and
a
trace
of
some
sweet
wheatgrain
feel
is
about
what
id
expect
nothing
remarkable
would
buy
again
d
very
highly
drinkable
great
balance
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
flavor
that
gives
off
a
nice
malty
profile
d
very
drinkable
but
too
many
hops
to
be
a
guzzler
for
me
you
need
to
slow
down
a
little
when
drinking
this
one
not
your
typical
lager
lots
more
hops
than
i
expected
i
think
it
would
be
a
really
nice
brew
to
cut
through
the
cheese
and
sauce
of
a
pizza
definitely
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
american
pale
ale
in
the
mold
of
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
rather
than
a
redamber
lager
not
really
what
im
looking
for
in
a
lager
a
nice
little
surprise
i
bought
it
and
poured
it
without
reading
the
label
properly
and
was
expecting
a
pale
lager
this
is
a
very
pleasant
red
lager
with
a
nice
hop
kick
and
slightly
creamy
malty
feel
with
firm
bitterness
this
would
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
if
it
were
available
in
australia
good
stuff
honestly
i
could
confuse
this
with
a
pale
ale
what
with
the
american
hops
leading
the
show
easy
to
drink
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
when
i
grabbed
a
lager
perhaps
with
a
different
mindset
this
would
have
been
more
impressive
to
me
a
good
drinkable
beer
whose
only
fault
is
how
long
it
sticks
in
your
mouth
after
you
drink
it
to
me
that
is
not
what
a
lager
should
be
if
this
is
what
beers
were
like
preprohibition
bring
me
back
there
definetly
nice
on
a
hot
day
i
wish
i
lived
a
little
closer
to
the
source
and
could
find
this
on
tap
more
often
love
the
brooklyn
lager
always
pick
up
a
six
pack
when
im
in
new
york
like
the
hoops
smell
and
has
a
great
taste
that
you
can
drink
all
night
also
had
on
tap
and
is
also
excellent
excellent
with
hamburgers
and
other
american
food
and
bbq
foods
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
stays
a
long
time
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
the
smell
is
carmel
malt
and
hops
the
taste
is
carmel
malt
hops
and
a
good
amount
of
citrus
notes
that
i
didnt
catch
in
the
smell
nice
and
crisp
its
a
little
too
sweet
but
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
im
not
sure
exactly
what
i
expected
from
brooklyn
lager
but
it
far
exceeded
what
i
thought
it
would
be
right
up
there
with
boston
lager
and
prima
pils
with
craft
lagers
ill
be
buying
when
the
weather
stays
warmer
a
classic
lager
that
is
easy
to
drink
nice
amber
color
slight
lacing
from
a
medium
head
huge
flavors
dont
pop
out
but
very
drinkable
a
great
introductory
craft
i
would
suppose
if
you
are
in
new
york
or
the
tristate
area
it
is
pretty
common
definetly
worth
a
try
the
definition
of
a
solid
lager
clean
crisp
and
fresh
pours
a
smooth
rust
with
a
decent
head
drinks
like
a
beer
is
supposed
to
drink
in
my
opinion
i
dont
think
there
is
a
fresher
smelling
or
tasting
beer
out
there
the
hops
are
alive
love
it
give
me
another
tastes
crisp
and
malty
up
front
followed
by
citrus
maybe
lemon
or
grapefruit
caramel
toasted
bread
hops
and
grain
the
malt
and
caramel
brings
a
sweetness
to
the
end
that
is
crisp
and
borders
on
bitter
with
a
final
note
of
orange
peel
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
on
the
smooth
side
while
the
carbonation
and
body
are
both
medium
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
but
the
flavor
is
only
above
average
even
for
a
lager
great
beer
to
drink
all
night
as
it
seems
to
flow
like
water
and
go
down
smooth
red
amber
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
settles
away
and
leaves
good
lacing
this
beer
smells
of
sweet
bready
malt
and
fresh
lemon
grass
the
tast
is
quite
wonderful
much
hoppier
than
i
expected
with
plenty
of
lemon
herbal
and
grassy
flavors
the
malt
is
caramely
toasty
and
not
too
sweet
playing
well
with
the
hops
to
make
a
balanced
presentation
nice
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
balanced
finish
very
drinkable
i
am
not
generaly
a
fan
of
reds
but
this
one
is
quite
tasty
when
i
took
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
i
could
tell
it
had
a
very
crisp
clean
taste
to
it
very
hoppy
and
it
is
similar
to
a
sam
adams
lager
i
could
definatly
see
my
self
at
a
bar
drinking
these
back
all
night
long
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
people
who
have
never
had
it
if
u
live
in
new
york
city
you
dont
have
an
excuse
not
to
have
it
because
you
can
get
it
at
almost
any
bar
down
there
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
choice
for
a
kegerator
as
its
mild
enough
that
most
people
will
drink
it
but
tastier
than
your
average
boring
lager
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
recently
and
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
you
shouldnt
try
it
i
love
a
great
lager
and
this
is
a
great
lager
drinkability
light
crisp
easy
to
drink
and
with
a
nice
crisp
biteeverything
you
could
want
in
a
session
beer
pretty
impressive
for
a
lager
since
i
usually
drink
heavier
stuff
drinkability
i
am
not
a
lager
guy
but
this
is
one
that
could
change
my
mind
quite
good
lager
good
quality
as
the
other
brooklyns
ive
had
dpretty
solid
mouthfeel
not
bad
flavor
pretty
straight
forward
decent
session
beer
overall
a
drinkable
beer
been
drinking
a
lot
of
outstanding
beers
recently
so
this
was
up
against
some
stiff
competition
i
probably
would
have
thought
this
much
more
flavorful
a
year
or
so
ago
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
working
in
the
yard
on
a
nice
summer
day
while
im
not
usually
a
lager
fan
this
one
was
a
fairly
pleasant
break
from
my
usual
stouts
and
porters
if
i
found
my
options
limited
at
the
liquor
store
as
was
the
case
when
i
picked
this
up
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
md
pretty
easy
going
down
but
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
to
offer
exceptionally
light
for
a
lager
ive
sampled
this
amber
colored
lager
from
both
tap
and
bottle
now
and
feel
that
its
carbonation
can
be
slightly
overwhelming
at
first
but
then
overcome
by
a
good
medium
body
but
perhaps
ive
been
drinking
too
much
ipa
lately
to
truly
judge
my
recent
first
sips
of
this
from
tap
it
was
difficult
to
detect
anything
revelatory
on
my
initial
smell
and
mouthfeel
but
i
was
impressed
with
its
good
drinkability
and
uncharacteristic
load
of
hops
this
is
a
very
refreshing
lager
and
my
preferred
choice
over
most
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
session
with
and
one
to
reach
for
on
a
grass
cutting
day
nice
easy
refreshing
and
good
d
lots
of
flavor
all
around
kind
of
reminiscent
of
an
oktoberfest
or
at
least
and
octoberfest
flavor
profile
is
less
than
clean
almost
alelike
and
sort
of
rustic
like
maybe
beer
used
to
be
way
back
when
d
drinkability
is
good
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
put
in
regular
rotation
but
its
not
bad
at
all
this
is
a
very
sessionable
brew
and
also
a
good
one
to
convert
a
bmc
as
the
taste
isnt
extreme
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
for
a
beer
1
month
past
its
best
by
date
its
very
sessionable
and
makes
me
want
to
have
another
one
makes
me
wonder
how
better
it
would
be
before
its
date
went
well
with
a
mild
curry
dish
for
dinner
edit
i
see
that
its
on
here
as
a
red
lager
that
could
explain
the
maltiness
that
i
didnt
expect
either
way
good
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
others
value
overpriced
very
pleasant
beer
definitely
sessionable
could
easily
enjoy
multiple
in
a
sitting
not
my
typical
beer
but
a
great
option
for
times
a
easy
drinker
is
called
for
glad
to
see
this
is
coming
to
kalamazoo
d
good
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
especially
for
hopheads
or
those
who
are
beginning
to
get
into
hops
id
prefer
this
over
pale
lagers
any
time
drinkability
this
is
a
great
lager
it
would
be
one
of
my
gotos
if
it
was
available
out
here
thanks
again
zach
please
realize
that
this
review
is
per
the
style
and
the
brooklyn
lager
nailed
it
a
very
fine
lager
and
well
affiliiated
in
the
american
amberred
lager
category
dnot
as
hoppy
as
sams
lacks
that
balance
one
looks
for
to
be
a
lager
bottle
pours
a
dark
clear
amber
with
the
slightest
haze
to
it
lots
of
foam
in
this
one
taste
is
malty
with
the
slightest
hint
of
sweet
fruits
with
a
mild
hop
taste
it
is
a
little
on
the
flat
side
though
so
maybe
its
an
old
six
pack
its
not
bad
for
a
lighter
beer
and
quite
sessionable
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
and
very
clean
and
crisp
with
a
strong
carbonation
that
all
pulls
together
to
make
an
excellent
lager
its
smooth
fairly
sweet
and
has
none
of
the
skunky
characters
you
sometimes
get
in
a
runofthemill
lager
enjoyed
this
one
thoroughly
mouthfeel
a
medium
body
with
some
carbonation
beer
has
a
lot
of
malt
in
it
and
its
medium
bordering
on
high
bodied
there
are
nice
citrus
hop
flavors
and
some
bitterness
at
the
end
ultimately
the
beer
is
a
little
dry
there
is
no
aftertaste
and
the
drinkability
is
high
mouthfeel
has
nice
connectivity
and
overall
is
a
very
good
beer
im
glad
ive
tried
this
so
many
times
and
in
different
incarnations
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
one
big
step
up
from
the
macro
stuff
but
i
still
rate
it
under
boston
lager
even
though
i
know
they
quasi
different
styles
may
sound
crazy
but
i
cant
help
to
wonder
how
this
would
be
very
near
or
just
past
the
best
buy
date
i
also
expect
to
like
it
a
bit
more
after
warming
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
great
amber
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
of
about
one
finger
that
lingered
and
laced
fairly
well
definite
lager
aroma
initially
with
ample
hops
aromas
of
citrusfloral
variety
balanced
by
a
good
malty
base
taste
is
has
a
good
malt
flavor
with
the
hops
balancing
well
carbonation
is
about
medium
with
a
good
crisp
feel
and
a
slight
oily
afterfeel
lingering
overall
a
good
drinking
beer
with
a
sessionable
abv
definitely
one
to
keep
at
the
ready
the
finish
is
very
refreshing
and
it
is
not
too
heavy
though
not
light
either
in
the
mouth
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
sitting
around
the
house
or
a
bar
without
getting
full
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
sessionable
lager
light
on
the
palate
but
it
does
have
some
complexity
in
the
flavor
strong
bodied
but
smooth
has
substance
but
light
enough
to
toss
a
few
of
these
back
and
hope
for
more
the
appearance
is
great
light
fluffy
off
white
foam
light
clear
yellow
red
color
i
really
didnt
detect
to
much
from
the
smell
but
there
is
some
good
citrusy
aromas
taste
is
great
with
exceptional
mouthfeel
i
know
this
review
is
brief
but
simply
put
this
is
a
great
beer
to
convert
your
friends
to
good
beer
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
d
might
have
been
a
bad
bottle
but
this
was
a
terrible
lager
the
style
was
wrong
and
it
actually
tasted
more
like
an
old
ale
to
me
might
try
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
i
had
a
bad
bottle
i
drank
this
all
while
think
about
drain
pouring
it
the
entire
time
orange
copper
body
with
an
ivory
head
the
nose
offers
sweet
toasted
malts
a
toasty
biscuit
character
and
grapefruit
peel
has
a
pleasant
tangerine
backing
in
the
taste
to
go
with
a
freshly
baked
biscuity
sweetness
encompassing
the
malt
profile
very
drinkable
and
succulent
for
the
style
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
but
a
sixer
of
this
would
be
delicious
next
to
most
lagers
mouthfeel
is
adequately
carbonated
somewhat
silky
and
medium
dry
doverall
a
real
goto
beer
that
you
can
find
almost
anywhere
in
the
city
i
could
and
often
do
put
back
several
of
these
making
it
an
excellent
session
beer
d
great
on
a
snowy
night
with
a
bowl
of
spicy
chili
a
hot
summer
night
on
the
roof
with
bbq
or
with
dessert
very
drinkable
and
very
pairable
with
all
kinds
of
food
this
is
seems
to
be
a
pretty
clean
and
crisp
beer
has
good
carbonation
and
nice
foamy
white
head
it
is
a
golden
amber
color
it
has
a
faint
malty
smell
it
has
a
good
malty
hop
after
taste
a
little
weak
in
the
front
but
that
is
okay
because
it
is
still
a
good
beer
this
is
a
good
lager
smooth
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
di
wont
be
buying
another
6
pack
maybe
there
other
offerings
are
better
drinkability
you
know
the
first
pint
went
down
well
but
after
that
the
bitterness
caught
up
to
me
making
it
a
bit
hard
to
keep
going
its
a
great
refreshing
beer
but
couldnt
drink
more
then
two
before
calling
it
quits
drinkability
is
great
could
go
all
night
on
these
guys
all
in
all
a
damn
fine
lager
well
done
brooklyn
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
very
flavoursome
lager
plenty
of
character
to
keep
it
interesting
but
mild
enough
to
be
a
true
session
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
inticing
deep
amber
colour
with
fluffy
head
which
settles
to
around
an
inch
and
lasts
pretty
much
all
the
way
down
lovely
grainy
smell
nice
balance
of
hop
bitterness
and
sweet
malts
very
flavoursome
beer
grainy
malts
hit
you
up
front
followed
by
pinegrassy
tones
and
some
caramel
full
mouth
feel
due
to
strong
carbonation
with
a
crisp
finish
and
some
alchohol
warmth
a
very
quaffable
brew
any
time
of
the
year
and
one
i
return
to
frequently
a
bottled
6
pack
does
the
job
just
nicely
i
poured
my
brooklyn
lager
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
appearance
is
reddish
copper
with
a
thick
puffy
white
head
the
smell
is
of
sappy
bitter
hops
and
a
slight
nutty
sweetness
the
taste
is
clean
with
well
balanced
spicyness
the
mouthfeel
is
more
viscus
than
a
typical
lager
with
nice
carbonation
good
session
beer
if
you
like
sam
adams
lager
this
one
is
pretty
similar
maybe
a
little
less
sweet
first
sip
is
clean
and
a
little
bit
more
bitter
than
your
standard
lager
pretty
highly
carbonated
but
the
beer
has
enough
backbone
to
stand
up
to
it
continuing
on
the
bitterness
in
the
initial
taste
fades
to
a
dry
malty
body
again
no
specific
flavors
dominate
the
malt
is
very
balanced
and
very
generic
finally
the
beer
disappears
with
zero
aftertaste
i
wouldnt
normally
object
to
the
presence
of
aftertaste
in
beer
assuming
its
not
actually
offensive
but
the
lack
of
aftertaste
in
this
particular
style
makes
it
remarkably
drinkable
i
dont
understand
how
anyone
could
criticize
its
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
tasty
lager
although
its
just
a
touch
too
malty
i
think
it
still
has
a
nice
hop
presence
either
way
its
very
refreshing
and
easydrinking
definitely
worth
grabbing
a
six
pack
i
had
two
of
these
alongside
an
enormous
sandwich
at
the
stage
deli
in
new
york
decent
brew
for
a
steak
paired
with
a
heavy
meal
this
would
be
an
outstanding
offering
on
its
own
it
feels
underwhelming
and
also
unappealing
on
the
aroma
and
overall
drinkability
i
think
i
will
go
grill
a
strip
cheers
pretty
solid
all
around
if
you
like
the
style
and
much
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
cheers
to
brooklyn
im
impressed
every
time
i
got
to
citi
field
i
drink
brooklyn
lager
best
ballpark
beer
out
there
even
though
the
mets
always
lose
i
always
win
with
brooklyn
lager
has
a
rather
light
copper
color
to
it
very
clear
and
not
much
density
head
isnt
too
bad
with
some
lacing
and
decent
retention
smells
of
toffee
caramelized
malts
with
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
a
bit
lemony
but
mostly
getting
the
caramelized
malts
and
toffee
and
with
quite
a
bit
of
hoppiness
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
one
and
feels
good
in
the
mouth
pours
a
deep
dark
golden
almost
red
color
with
a
two
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
before
impaling
itself
to
the
edges
of
my
glass
smell
is
very
floral
with
a
hint
of
citrus
sweet
malts
a
little
bread
a
little
caramel
round
out
the
nose
taste
is
a
little
odd
for
a
lager
sweet
up
front
caramel
and
floral
hops
play
off
of
each
other
nicely
then
a
slight
mineral
taste
followed
a
dry
hoppy
finish
medium
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
smooth
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
this
a
great
light
easy
drinking
lager
overall
a
great
tasty
lager
thats
somewhat
simple
and
quite
refreshing

the
board
but
nothing
really
stuck
out
that
would
make
me
say
this
is
an
excellent
beer
definitely
worth
the
try
and
would
love
to
try
some
more
of
their
offerings
this
is
the
first
brooklyn
beer
i
tried
and
is
quite
the
good
amber
lager
if
there
had
been
any
nose
im
sure
i
would
have
rated
the
brew
higher
but
its
still
a
good
session
brew
m
high
carbonation
but
works
well
crisp
and
tasty
this
beer
is
sessionable
and
delicious
very
pleasently
surprised
by
brooklyns
most
widespread
offering
drinkability
very
good
it
goes
well
with
hamburgers
and
it
also
stands
well
on
its
own
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
does
not
make
me
want
to
drink
another
though
medium
body
smooth
with
touch
of
astringency
near
the
finish
crisp
moderate
carbonation
is
almost
fizzy
but
keeps
body
and
smoothness
the
smell
was
terrific
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
great
floral
smell
the
taste
was
somewhat
similar
a
bit
more
complex
with
early
sweet
malt
transforming
into
a
nice
dry
hoppy
finish
it
has
a
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
substantial
but
not
too
heavy
this
is
now
one
of
my
top
session
beers
along
with
sam
adams
they
are
two
great
beers
you
can
spend
a
night
or
day
with
d
excellent
flavorful
lager
that
goes
down
easily
when
drinking
it
you
can
tast
the
floral
hops
that
were
used
to
make
this
great
drink

with

the
sales
pitch
around
this
beer
has
deterred
me
from
buying
it
but
in
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
decided
to
bring
a
bottle
home
anyway
its
a
brew
that
pretty
much
pleases
everyone
normally
this
will
put
a
beer
lover
off
but
i
was
positively
surprised
it
poured
with
a
finger
of
foam
or
so
and
with
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
the
smell
was
stong
and
citrusy
surprisingly
similar
to
an
ipa
the
main
thrust
of
the
taste
is
a
pronounced
bitterness
wrapped
with
a
sweetness
and
some
malts
a
little
toast
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
in
general
i
think
brooklyn
lager
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
pleasing
but
perhaps
lacking
in
character
overall
nothing
spectacular
or
unique
doesnt
really
remind
me
of
the
lagers
ive
tried
before
although
it
is
a
different
style
comparing
this
to
most
lagers
it
kicks
butt
on
its
own
its
still
a
decent
beer
and
is
pretty
drinkable
grassy
malt
and
bitter
hops
light
fruitiness
from
the
malt
persistent
low
level
herbal
hops
lightly
sticky
mouth
and
long
longering
bitterness
pretty
good
stuff
d
this
is
excellent
for
a
lager
the
lager
has
as
much
depth
as
your
average
ipa
while
still
leaving
a
subtle
presence
this
would
be
a
fabulous
session
beer
would
go
well
with
food
it
is
actually
worse
in
drinkablity
than
your
typical
decent
macro
because
the
flavor
is
so
complex
now
if
only
it
were
as
costly
as
the
average
macro
brooklyn
is
an
awesome
brewery
ill
have
to
make
my
way
up
there
one
of
these
days
the
beer
pours
an
orangish
golden
with
a
frothy
head
that
holds
and
laces
nicely
there
are
subtle
hop
aromas
balanced
nicely
with
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
the
overall
smell
however
is
not
that
strong
the
beer
tastes
fairly
similar
to
the
smell
however
the
taste
is
not
weak
at
all
there
is
a
decent
mouthfell
complemented
by
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
what
it
is
there
was
even
more
of
a
hop
presence
than
i
was
expecting
which
was
quite
welcome
this
pours
a
honeylike
color
with
a
smallish
head
the
smell
is
not
really
that
strongbut
you
can
make
out
some
malt
aromas
the
taste
has
a
real
sweet
malt
flavor
that
is
a
real
delight
the
mf
is
lightbut
it
does
have
a
slight
watery
aftertaste
this
beer
is
one
that
could
be
an
everyday
beer
its
not
perfectbut
its
worth
trying
this
beer
pours
a
sweet
reddish
amber
color
and
leaves
a
thin
white
head
that
disappates
quickly
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
caramel
aspects
that
give
hints
of
honey
and
lemon
the
taste
of
this
lager
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
sticky
sweet
malt
weighs
on
your
palate
in
a
good
way
and
there
is
a
lemon
wheat
flavor
on
the
palate
that
makes
this
a
balanced
refreshing
brew
to
drink
all
day
def
session
quality
clear
golden
orange
colour
toped
by
a
short
offwhite
head
the
foam
reduces
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
behind
some
nice
lacing
bold
hoppy
aroma
for
a
lager
quite
floral
with
a
hint
of
herbal
and
citrus
character
mellow
sweet
malt
maybe
a
bit
toasty
hides
in
there
as
well
hops
kick
off
the
flavour
melding
into
a
balanced
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
fruit
at
the
mid
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
with
plenty
of
flavour
mediumlight
body
with
just
the
right
balance
of
gentle
carbonation
to
provide
a
creamy
texture
finishes
with
just
a
hint
of
dryness
this
is
a
quality
lager
a
pleasure
to
drink
if
i
see
this
on
tap
ill
definitely
give
it
a
try
not
much
bad
to
say
about
this
one
for
a
lager
this
borders
on
amazingly
good
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
cheers
pours
a
pretty
medium
amber
with
a
good
two
finger
head
good
longevity
and
very
good
lace
good
malty
presence
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
spicy
hop
aromas
good
malty
flavors
with
a
good
bit
of
hop
spicyness
and
bitterness
even
more
than
the
pale
ale
i
think
leaves
a
nice
hop
bitterness
all
over
the
tounge
it
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
a
beer
in
this
catergory
but
it
is
a
tasty
one
and
a
good
solid
beer
i
am
surprised
that
i
have
not
reviewed
the
brooklyn
lager
before
but
here
it
goes
the
brew
pours
to
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
fat
white
head
that
has
great
retention
and
leaves
sheets
of
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
looks
to
be
very
carbonated
with
the
amount
of
bubbles
traversing
up
the
side
of
the
glass
the
first
aroma
that
i
notice
is
the
hops
according
to
the
website
it
is
german
hallertauer
vanguard
and
cascade
hops
seems
that
i
notice
the
cascade
hop
more
than
the
others
but
that
is
probably
due
to
inexperience
the
taste
is
crisp
very
fresh
feel
notice
the
caramel
malt
a
bit
at
the
start
but
it
does
have
a
heavy
hop
taste
more
flowery
than
citrus
very
nice
brew
might
not
be
one
if
i
am
having
friends
over
that
like
a
more
all
purpose
lager
with
the
hop
aromas
and
taste
but
for
me
a
pretty
good
session
brew
very
good
product
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
tons
of
flavor
for
a
lager
with
a
great
hop
character
but
the
malt
is
right
there
also
people
talk
about
the
perfect
lawn
mower
beer
this
has
to
be
considered
in
the
mix
very
crisp
and
refreshing
highly
recommended
best
buy
date
of
pours
a
copper
color
that
was
darker
than
expected
with
nice
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
and
a
thina
off
white
head
could
definately
pass
for
an
apa
the
aroma
is
layered
and
has
an
english
air
to
it
with
floral
hops
toasted
bread
light
caramel
minerals
and
some
fruity
yeast
elements
that
i
was
not
expecting
surprisingly
complex
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
also
coplex
and
well
balanced
with
toasted
bread
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
flavors
and
some
floral
and
citrusy
hops
seems
alot
more
like
an
english
ale
than
an
american
lager
but
its
freakin
good
regardless
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
slightly
bigger
body
than
your
typical
lager
but
still
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
another
good
offering
from
brooklyn
nothing
spectacular
here
but
a
good
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
session
beer
drinkability
a
nice
transitional
beer
wouldnt
offend
to
many
palates
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
a
good
tailgate
beer
or
session
beer
especially
with
the
5
abv
worth
a
try
this
is
a
noncompromising
lager
beer
very
american
micro
this
washed
down
very
nicely
with
my
spicy
chipotleorange
barbeque
chicken
on
a
bun
the
citrus
flavors
balanced
perfectly
with
the
orange
bbq
and
the
hops
balanced
the
spice
every
sip
was
pure
refreshment
to
my
burning
tongue
i
found
this
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
on
its
own
as
well
though
a
little
bold
for
a
session
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
pass
me
another
please
a
winner
in
the
american
allmalt
lager
category
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
brews
great
with
any
gamey
meat
dish
like
venison
reminds
me
of
the
taste
in
the
air
during
autumn
in
the
northeast
so
ask
your
local
bar

where
brooklyn
at
an
average
beer
lacking
in
complexity
and
balanced
character
but
a
reasonable
example
of
the
style
it
pours
a
mediumgold
color
with
good
carbonation
rather
subtle
malt
smell
bland
taste
without
complexity
or
backbone
malt
presence
is
all
there
is
unpleasant
aftertaste
due
to
the
residual
sugar
texture
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
think
under
the
right
conditions
a
few
of
these
could
be
had
a
more
balanced
body
is
needed
to
make
this
more
enjoyable
but
then
it
might
not
be
the
right
style
d
this
is
a
great
fresh
example
of
and
allmalt
lager
if
this
was
a
typical
lager
preprohibition
then
they
had
it
pretty
good
good
complexity
and
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
bubbly
mediumbodied
very
nice
very
drinkable
as
more
brooklyn
brews
are
i
hesitate
to
rate
this
as
is
part
of
me
wants
to
rate
it
lower
because
i
dont
think
its
reeeeally
a
lager
but
i
liked
it
so
there
fear
not
the
bottomfermenting
yeasts
this
beer
is
smooth
has
some
nice
mild
grainy
flavors
and
sports
just
enough
hops
that
the
ipa
lover
in
me
doesnt
feel
ashamed
to
have
this
beer
in
my
hands
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
this
beer
proves
that
the
style
deserves
some
respect
bud
miller
and
coors
try
this
one
out
and
realize
that
your
beers
dont
have
to
suck
this
is
a
nice
entry
level
beer
that
i
will
share
with
my
macro
enamoured
neighbors
starts
out
ok
with
floral
aroma
and
reasonable
appearance
with
head
first
sips
fine
but
tires
quickly
not
so
drinkable
some
bitterness
and
balance
malts
and
ok
aftertaste
but
just
damn
boring
and
plain
jaccuse
least
liked
of
the
brooklyn
product
line
aroma
of
spicy
hops
tastes
citrusy
inital
hop
taste
is
strong
but
mellows
with
the
malt
no
strong
aftertase
a
very
drinkable
different
lager
definitely
reccomend
trying
this
one
best
before
oct
05
pours
a
bright
amber
with
a
finger
of
white
head
and
not
much
lacing
smell
is
suprisingly
full
of
floral
hops
with
a
light
bready
malt
coming
through
as
well
taste
is
not
like
a
normal
lager
with
a
pretty
strong
hop
taste
hitting
upfront
mellowing
into
a
slightly
sweet
malt
that
completely
balances
the
hops
and
hardly
leaves
an
aftertaste
at
all
medium
bodied
with
a
lower
carbonation
level
than
most
american
lagers
this
feels
great
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
that
i
would
share
with
my
macro
drinking
friendsbest
american
lager
ive
had
brooklyn
lager
is
the
second
superb
brooklyn
offering
that
ive
had
in
the
past
several
weeks
brooklyn
pilsner
was
the
other
ill
have
to
give
the
nod
to
this
one
though
the
secrets
of
its
success
include
a
healthy
amount
of
malt
an
even
more
healthy
amount
of
hops
and
an
inspired
hop
bill
of
disparate
yet
wonderfully
complementary
flavors
i
like
this
one
a
lot
drinkablity
this
came
in
a
sampler
case
and
i
only
have
3
left
oh
no
i
will
definitely
be
getting
some
more
date
notched
on
the
side
of
the
label
that
is
a
good
start
the
color
is
an
inviting
dark
amber
topped
off
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
aroma
is
all
hops
so
different
from
what
i
expect
in
a
lager
but
such
a
welcome
surprise
brooklyn
makes
a
nice
beer
with
this
one
great
hop
flavors
pushing
right
up
to
its
malt
counterpart
perfect
balance
and
amazing
taste
this
makes
an
outstanding
session
brew
i
feel
very
fortunate
to
have
this
as
one
of
my
locals
this
is
my
absolute
favorite
lager
and
a
must
try
for
anyone
in
the
ny
area
solid
stuff
a
real
tasty
treat
from
brooklyn
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
that
diminishes
to
a
frothy
cap
very
inviting
smell
with
a
fruity
base
to
it
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
accompaniment
as
far
as
taste
goes
it
is
very
refreshing
a
burst
of
leafy
hoppiness
followed
by
a
sweet
fruity
maltiness
hints
of
raisins
grapes
and
oranges
intermingle
in
this
justabovesimple
brew
it
is
extremely
tasty
if
i
may
reiterate
in
between
the
light
and
medium
aspects
of
body
it
has
a
semiapparent
carbonation
that
is
rejuvenating
one
of
the
more
quaffable
brews
ive
had
and
a
delight
to
imbibe
really
surprising
dont
be
scared
by
the
lager
title
on
the
outside
of
this
one
it
has
amazing
depth
and
flavor
the
smell
is
hoppy
almost
as
much
so
as
an
ipa
and
the
taste
is
the
same
way
color
is
reddishbrown
with
a
moderate
head
the
first
sip
is
pretty
pungent
especially
if
you
are
expecting
anything
like
a
traditional
lager
the
hops
take
shape
right
away
as
it
goes
down
in
mellows
out
and
almost
entirely
leaves
your
mouth
so
there
is
no
strong
aftertaste
recommended
to
anyone
overallone
of
the
more
flavorful
lagers
ive
ever
had
somewhat
similar
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
more
floral
in
my
opinion
nice
beer
i
look
forward
to
more
brooklyn
releases
drinkability
is
quite
good
as
a
result
and
its
a
great
beer
for
outdoor
events
concert
bbq
etc

and
its
topped
by
a
1
finger
tan
head
that
slowly
recedes
and
leaves
little
bits
of
lacing
all
i
got
in
the
aroma
was
citric

floral

there
are

that
are

that
give
it
a
medium

the
bubbles
rise
slowly
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
tingly

still
fairly
smooth
this
makes
me
think
of
a
bottomfermented

a
delicious
lager
mouthfeel
is
creamy
for
this
style
medium
bodied
and
has
a
biscuity
floral

finish
well
done
now
i
can
renenber
why
i
used
to
drink
this
i
am
not
only
enamoured
with
the
kickass
graphic
design
of
the
bottlesby
milton
glaser
but
also
the
taste
there
is
something
special
about
this
brewery
the
sticky
sweet
taste
that
i
am
so
addicted
to
the
lager
pours
a
gorgeous
red
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
so
friendly
you
can
smell
the
hoppinesss
the
taste
is
crisp
as
hell
the
hops
rock
the
malts
rock
in
terms
of
specific
flavors
i
wont
go
into
it
it
is
a
crazy
melding
of
all
sorts
of
goodness
the
taste
is
unique
and
so
pleasant
i
love
all
of
their
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
it
is
so
damn
drinkable
pours
from

bottle
a
reddish

color
with
a

smells
clean
with
sweet
malt
and
considerable
hop

smells
of
light
brown
sugars
and
maybe
some
slight
herbals

prefer
this
one
on
the
cooler
of
summer
nights
brooklyn

and
refreshing
yet
full
and
flavorful
at
the
same
time
many
thanks
to
lenin
for
all
of
the
brooklyn
beers
one
of
the
best
examples
of
what
would
be
considered
a

obvoiusly
indigenous
to
the
u
s
pours
a
lightly
hazed
orangy

a
foamy

dissipates
into
a
thin
collar
some
toasty
and
husky
malt
aromas
with
flickerings
of
loweralpha
german
hills
hops
some
underlying
sweetness
but
almost
sublime
good
flavor
huskiness
and
lightly
floral
hops
play
a
major
role
and
a
citrusy
astringency
nearer
the
finish
is
most
interesting
because
it
doesnt
seem
related
to
the
hops
mouthfeel
and
texture
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
level
is
average
to
slightly
above
which
may
account
for
the
citrusiness
carbonic
acid
a
heartier
lager
whilst
maintaining
an
average
abv
my
kind
of
session
lager
this
is
my
kind
of
lager
a
bit
hopped
up
but
not
overdone
as
in
many
american
ipas
and
super
refreshing
pours
a
very
clear
light
orange
amber
color
with
an
average
head
that
disappears
quickly
smell
and
taste
have
a
strong
malt
foundation
with
some
sweet
honey
butterscotch
notes
and
at
the
same
time
citrusy
hoppy
and
piney
perfect
balance
here
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
another
perfect
summer
beer
bring
it
on
a
clean
golden
orange
colored
beer
has
a
small
creamy
off
white
head
with
some
lace
the
aroma
starts
with
an
nice
hoppy
citrusy
and
tea
like
character
with
a
smooth
sweet
caramel
malty
background
there
is
a
quick
snap
of
hop
followed
by
the
tea
like
character
then
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
back
the
hops
for
an
even
bitter
and
dry
finish
pour
tawny
and
clear
with
a
very
nice
foamy
offwhite
head
with
nice
retention
mostly
hops
in
the
nose
and
little
malt
able
to
be
smelled
faint
biscuit
malt
in
the
first
taste
leading
to
a
citrusy
hoppy
finish
i
would
like
a
little
bit
more
malt
backing
in
it
though
maybe
thats
just
me
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
this
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
still
would
like
to
have
more
malt
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
this
one
if
every
macrobrewed
american
lager
were
half
as
good
as
this
we
would
live
in
a
much
better
beer
culture
to
be
sure
filmy
cream
of
sheening
head
that
has
a
fair
amount
of
stick
light
amber
hue
is
clear
and
has
a
fair
amount
of
action
going
on
soapy
malt
wash
on
nose
leaves
mouth
watering
and
just
a
touch
of
light
oak
bite
at
top
of
goodly
caramel
malt
and
a
wash
of
lemonade
finings
on
mouth
makes
this
pour
whoringly
refreshing
i
will
search
for
this
during
the
summer
months
without
reservation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
just
cannot
find
a
characteristic
that
separates
it
from
any
other
its
slightly
above
normal
but
i
like
it
has
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
the
head
settles
to
a
lace
around
the
glass
smells
very
hoppy
a
spicy
floral
hop
has
a
firm
malty
body
taste
very
hoppy
but
has
enough
sweet
malts
to
go
around
all
round
a
good
lager
not
quite
a
boston
lager
but
makes
a
great
session
beer
i
dont
care
much
for
this
style
but
bought
this
one
along
with
some
other
brooklyns
that
ive
never
tried
over
the
past
week
this
pours
a
clear
amber
body
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
stands
about
a
centimeter
tall
and
insists
on
hanging
around
eventually
leaving
some
impressive
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
very
lagerish
with
vague
sweet
maltiness
and
some
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
typical
for
style
with
a
light
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
crisp
and
refreshing
for
the
most
part
with
slight
floral
hops
bitterness
malt
is
quite
bready
but
thankfully
stays
in
the
background
for
the
most
part
another
quality
brew
from
a
fine
nyc
brewery
this
is
a
good
one
for
fans
of
american
lagers
overall
a
very
drinkable
nondescript
lager
with
a
bit
more
hops
that
i
was
expecting
not
too
bad
a
very
tasty
beer
and
straightforward
brew
thick
malty
backbone
with
a
melted
caramel
sweetness
slight
buttery
backdrop
with
a
clean
hoppy
finish
the
brooklyn
lager
has
great
drinkability
level
and
would
make
a
good
choice
to
pair
up
with
a
number
of
different
foods
decent
beer
nothing
to
get
that
excited
about
but
good
enough
as
it
warmed
malt
became
much
more
pronounced
yet
retained
a
good
balance
with
the
sublte
bittering
hops
golden
yellow
colored
with
active
carbonation
and
a
medium
foamy
head
this
was
a
classic
looking
lager
when
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
from
the
signature
minimalist
brooklyn
styled
brown
bottle
the
aroma
indicated
presence
of
sweet
honey
and
caramel
malt
and
noble
grassy
hops
in
this
beer
and
after
the
first
sip
i
could
tell
that
it
did
not
lie
medium
bodied
bready
sticky
creamy
and
slightly
salty
this
is
a
moderately
flavored
crowd
pleasing
lager
with
enough
character
and
hoppy
bite
so
that
it
would
not
disappoint
even
the
seasoned
beer
connoisseur
among
whose
ranks
i
would
not
place
myself
i
might
add
worth
seeking
out
if
in
the
mood
for
some
simpler
pleasures
clear
pale
amberbrown
body
with
a
good
head
theres
a
slight
tingle
in
the
nose
the
flavor
has
a
slightly
bready
malt
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
actually
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
i
actually
preferred
this
over
the
disapointing
pilsner
i
could
drink
this
regularly
with
no
complaints
a
nice
solid
beer
for
its
niche
this
beer
is
quite
good
indeed
and
worth
a
look
a
slightly
above
average
beer
in
most
respects
solid
but
nothing
amazing
ill
be
sure
to
try
it
on
tap
when
i
have
a
chance
but
i
probably
wont
buy
any
more
if
you
like
lagers
but
dont
want
an
american
macro
check
out
this
offering
from
brooklyn
pours
with
an
inchdeep
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
spotty
soapish
offwhite
film
despite
a
fairly
high
level
of
carbonation
beer
is
translucent
sienna
in
color
with
bronze
highlights
bordering
on
orange
clean
somewhat
dry
nosefeel
with
light
aromas
of
toasted
malts
smooth
nottoosweet
malt
flavors
share
the
stage
with
a
surprising
amount
of
hop
bitterness
surprising
amount
of
overall
flavor
actually
mouthfeel
is
firm
and
hardly
overcarbonated
with
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
that
hangs
around
for
several
seconds
after
each
swallow
theres
not
much
going
on
here
but
this
would
be
serviceable
for
heavy
session
drinking
at
any
rate
id
take
this
over
just
about
any
other
standard
american
lager
from
a
comparablysized
brewery
it
poured
a
good
looking
light
bronze
with
a
small
white
head
it
had
a
pleasant
light
hoppy
smell
too
it
the
taste
fell
in
line
although
there
was
more
hop
in
the
taste
than
the
nose
there
wasnt
much
malt
to
this
one
just
a
lot
of
hops
the
feel
was
light
and
very
dry
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
you
could
tell
it
had
been
well
brewed
but
it
just
isnt
your
beer
this
lager
has
just
too
much
hops
for
my
taste
and
id
be
looking
for
an
alternative
after
tasting
again
this
is
one
of
the
hoppiest
lagers
ive
had
to
date
i
was
really
pleased
with
this
brew
great
ontap
as
well
the
elements
of
this
brew
mesh
very
well
together
the
hop
presence
was
more
assertive
than
i
would
have
predicted
but
the
brew
is
not
bitter
at
all
and
is
in
fact
dangerously
easy
to
drink
it
can
be
compared
to
samuel
adams
boston
lager
but
overall
i
would
rank
this
a
top
session
brew
poured
out
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
lasted
for
a
good
while
smell
consisted
of
sweet
malts
with
an
undertone
of
hops
and
caramel
but
it
was
a
little
subtle
though
taste
made
up
for
it
though
its
more
on
the
sweet
side
sweeten
malts
come
up
first
with
an
underlying
of
hops
which
seems
to
be
big
at
times
and
some
caramel
moutfeel
is
medium
which
was
good
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
session
beer
a
good
beer
at
a
party
recently
my
german
friend
noted
that
this
was
one
hoppy
lager
i
tried
it
yeah
yeah
hops
it
pours
clean
and
golden
with
slight
hints
of
red
nose
is
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
taste
is
clean
remarkably
with
malt
notes
and
that
lager
sournessgrassyness
mixed
in
with
the
hops
and
dies
down
to
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
nice
if
a
bit
carbonated
but
it
adds
to
the
clean
and
crisp
of
the
lager
maybe
one
day
ill
devote
a
friday
at
the
brewery
to
this
one
im
coming
around
to
lagers
slowly
but
this
one
is
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
try
more
poured
a
deep
golden
in
color
with
a
huge
sticky
white
head
all
sorts
of
lacing
aromas
are
caramel
sweet
with
some
flowery
hoppyness
flavor
is
pretty
tasty
i
wish
had
this
in
a
can
in
college
flavorful
mix
of
caramel
sweetness
mixed
with
a
muted
hop
note
nice
mouthfeel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
cream
colored
head
looks
pretty
good
the
smell
was
just
malt
and
floral
hops
the
taste
was
likewise
good
balance
between
the
two
more
hop
flavor
then
expected
which
balanced
the
anticipated
strong
malt
flavor
this
lager
is
better
than
average
and
i
would
drink
these
anytime
very
drinkable
this
would
be
good
for
a
session
decent
but
for
8
bucks
a
6
its
a
bit
pricey
for
what
you
get
out
of
this
one
the
head
is
dense
and
regular
it
fades
smoothly
and
slowly
on
the
amber
orange
color
body
the
smell
showed
a
great
and
sweet
fruitiness
mostly
red
fruits
yeasty
with
light
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
didnt
completely
fulfill
the
expections
i
got
from
the
smell
it
is
good
but
the
red
fruit
notes
are
much
less
noticeable
theres
more
of
a
tart
grapefruit
aspect
that
bites
the
tongue
or
maybe
its
more
floral
the
round
and
very
sweet
maltiness
sometimes
evokes
caramel
the
hops
are
quite
thick
and
probably
contribute
to
the
grapefruitfloral
aspect
of
the
brew
im
confused
about
this
aspect
though
i
guess
it
just
didnt
give
me
what
i
thought
itd
give
me
from
the
smell
still
a
remarkable
lager
richly
amber
in
color
the
nose
is
of
sweaty
sticky
cheap
yellow
hop
buds
caramel
sundae
topping
struggles
to
emerge
from
underneath
the
piercing
load
of
herb
on
the
palate
it
is
sharp
with
an
awkward
clash
of
ingredients
and
a
deficit
of
integration
and
harmony
it
tastes
somewhat
rushed
and
painted
by
numbers
alternating
impressions
of
gritty
metal
and
gastric
acids
are
mild
but
still
too
obvious
some
indiscriminate
hopheads
may
be
delighted
with
this
beer
i
doubt
however
that
one
could
honestly
take
pleasure
in
consuming
it
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
a
delicious
and
drinkable
beer
pretty
longlasting
tannish

interplayed

varied
with
smooth

malts
and
dry
hops
and
ends
happily
clean
couldve
had
about
8
of
these
i
think
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
americanmade
lagers
ive
had
its
slightly
similar
to
anchor
steam
but
different
highly
recommended
a
great
marathon
beer
ive
found
i
like
this
beer
towards
the
end
of
a
long
night
it
quenches
the
thirst
and
still
has
alcohol
but
not
so
much
that
things
turn
ugly
plus
it
tastes
great
sweet
hops
and
only
slightly
bitterpleasantly
so
mind
you
it
poured
copper
in
color
with
a
thin
head
very
little
lace
formed
around
the
glass
i
could
be
quite
happy
drinking
this
beer
while
bbqing
on
a
hot
day
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
very
good
this
beer
has
a
very
well
developed
taste
with
a
good
hops
character
however
the
hops
are
not
overpowering
and
therefore
do
not
leave
a
strong
aftertaste
which
makes
for
good
drinkability
highly
recommended
nice
amber
color
with
good
head
retention
and
very
good
lacing
smell
is
a
nice
rounded
malt
with
a
hint
of
yeast
taste
is
initially
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
nice
bitter
element
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
easy
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
fine
due
to
smooth
quality
good
mouthfeel
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
slowly
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
malts
lager
yeast
and
a
breadlike
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
and
bready
it
has
a
bit
of
hops
present
which
only
adds
to
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
it
has
great
malt
character
and
excellent
mouthfeel
a
great
drinking
lager
this
lager
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
offwhite
foam
that
settled
and
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
malty
and
fruity
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
faint
dry
caramel
character
and
with
some
fruity
and
floral
hops
notes
the
finish
was
lightly
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
a
woody
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
relatively
clean
with
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
and
overall
it
was
fairly
dry
this
was
a
very
respectable
lager
a
legend
in
the
realms
of
the
session
beer
a
superb
lager
one
i
keep
coming
back
to
time
after
time
pours
a
golden
amber
with
tannish
firm
head
that
settles
nicely
and
leaves
a
sheeting
of
lacing
aroma
is
bready
with
a
floral
note
and
a
hint
of
citrus
nothing
like
the
smell
of
a
brooklyn
lager
freshly
poured
nice
big
malt
flavor
and
a
surprising
hop
note
that
some
might
find
strange
in
a
lager
however
seems
perfect
and
quite
surprising
carbonation
is
not
overdone
making
this
a
smooth
crisp
refreshing
brew
that
could
easily
be
a
great
session
beer
but
is
a
little
sneaky
with
a
5
0
a
b
v
if
the
choices
are
limited
you
cant
go
wrong
by
ordering
this
medium
bodied
but
i
didnt
like
the
way
this
felt
too
acidic
good
bitterness
for
this
style
of
lager
good
solid
bland
lager
the
taste
was
very
carbonated
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
can
imagine
this
being
a
fine
session
beer
because
it
is
lightly
bodied
nicely
balanced
and
quite
frankly
does
not
have
an
overwhelming
amount
of
flavor
sweet
malt
and
then
a
cleaning
swipe
of
hops
and
a
lingering
sweetness
but
flavor
well
it
tastes
like
a
yuengling
not
at
all
unpleasant
and
one
i
can
see
drinking
when
im
going
to
have
more
than
one
ok
5
but
as
a
nightcap
it
leaves
a
little
bit
to
be
desired
first
sip
reveals
average
body
and
carbonation
the
flavor
is
light
and
grainy
malt
with
some
grassy
hop
notes
coming
through
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
beer
a
good
lager
a
little
more
pale
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
head
didnt
shape
up
either
tastes
good
though
at
first
i
got
this
sublte
hop
flavor
im
not
sure
what
kind
by
the
end
an
extremely
prevalent
sweetness
came
through
almost
like
a
dopplebock
type
malty
flavor
actually
im
not
sure
whether
this
was
because
it
was
the
end
of
the
beer
or
because
it
had
warmed
a
little
the
sweetness
was
slightly
overbearing
but
nothing
i
couldnt
handle
for
the
most
part
a
very
solid
drinkable
beer
though
id
rather
have
a
sammy
but
thats
just
me
oh
and
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
a
real
high
note
this
is
a
great
lager
not
like
what
the
macro
breweries
have
done
to
the
name
it
has
a
really
nice
foral
scent
with
a
nice
smooth
malty
and
hoppy
taste
brooklyn
has
made
one
of
the
best
lagers
outside
of
germany
12
ounce
bottle

fresh
beer
golden
amber
with
an
outmeal
colored
head
soft
malt
yeast
and
flowery
hops
in
the
nose
balance
and
drinkability
are
the
theme
here
freshness
of
the
hops
is
obvious
a
nice
clean
lager
a
great
session
brew
when
you
venture
into
new
york
city
area
quite
a
bit
you
definitely
see
this
beer
around
enough
and
it
is
often
a
very
good
choice
depending
on
what
place
you
go
to
this
beer
may
not
be
in
the
upper
tier
of
beers
but
it
is
certainly
good
the
first
thing
that
strikes
you
about
it
is
its
nice
amber
color
it
is
a
hoppy
beer
which
goes
down
very
smooth
it
has
decent
carbonation
it
is
a
lager
as
the
title
shows
but
it
doesnt
have
too
much
of
a
lingering
aftertaste
which
is
something
that
turns
some
people
off
this
makes
it
a
great
beer
to
buy
a
friend
at
a
bar
which
has
a
good
beer
selection
that
may
not
know
much
about
beers
other
than
macros
nice
amber
color
with
decent
head
that
fades
to
a
fizzy
minute
head
leaves
a
little
lacing
quite
aromatic
for
a
lager
with
hints
of
hops
taste
is
a
good
clean
flavor
with
a
hop
bite
this
is
a
unique
taste
to
most
lagers
and
brooklyn
pulls
it
off
well
crisp
aftertaste
with
that
lingering
hop
flavor
well
balanced
malts
and
a
overall
good
brew
very
drinkable
and
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
drinkability
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
nicely
done
the
classic
amber
lager
pours
a
light
red
with
a
white
head
sweet
malt
with
a
suprisingly
floral
hop
aroma
smell
is
mild
taste
mimics
the
aroma
of
the
beer
tingly
carbonation
on
the
mouth
with
an
easy
drinkability
pairs
nicely
with
the
pepperoni
and
mushroom
pie
at
grimaldis
mouthfeel
good
overall
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
good
thickness
in
the
mouth
very
smooth
at
first
then
a
slight
crispness
hits
the
back
of
your
tongue
clean
finish
extremely
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
this
was
a
very
satisfying
brew
orangy
light
amber
color
with
a
slight
offwhitecream
colored
head
grassy
hoppy
aroma
wasnt
expecting
that
has
a
sweet
chewy
malty
aroma
with
bready
and
toffee
hints
very
well
balanced
with
a
juicy
taste
slight
hint
of
a
butter
in
the
aftertaste
an
excellent
lager
one
of
the
absolute
best
ive
ever
had
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
into
my
16
oz
brooklyn
brewery
pint
glass
white
foamy
head
lingers
which
leaves
good
lacing
starts
fruity
and
malty
but
finishes
dry
with
some
nice
hop
bitterness
hallertauer
and
cascade
hops
this
well
balanced
beer
is
round
and
crisp
and
makes
for
a
nice
session
beer
its
a
constant
staple
in
my
fridge
ive
been
drinking
this
since
the
early
90s
and
makes
for
a
good
crossover
beer
for
macro
drinkers
one
of
the
most
underrated
beers
on
this
site
poured
a
dirty
white
foamy
head
its
leaving
a
bit
of
lace
as
it
sinks
back
down
into
the
beer
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
the
beer
is
light
amber
in
color
and
pretty
clear
the
taste
is
just
a
bit
sweet
its
definitely
leaning
toward
the
malt
side
but
theres
enough
hops
in
there
to
keep
it
from
going
to
far
this
beer
is
just
ok
out
of
the
bottle
i
had
a
can
yes
can
of
brooklyn
lager
a
couple
months
ago
and
it
was
super
hoppys
kinda
like
a
lageripa
hybrid
and
i
loved
it
tasted
102503
a
really
good
lager
somewhat
in
the
mold
of
samuel
adams
boston
lager
but
much
better
sweetish
malts
give
way
too
a
nicely
hoppy
spicy
dryish
finish
lots
of
flavour
yet
mildly
refreshing
really
nice
quaffer
not
really
complex
in
any
way
just
nice
n
tasty
and
enjoyable
to
drink
pours
clear
copper
smallish
white
head
that
sticks
around
quite
well
and
leaves
good
lacing
body
has
a
lot
of
tiny
bubbles
meandering
about
aroma
is
mainly
caramel
and
some
other
malt
sweetness
some
hops
playing
around
in
the
back
to
balance
it
out
nicely
flavor
starts
with
some
caramel
middle
is
clean
with
a
slight
fruitiness
ends
with
a
good
chewy
and
tasty
hoppiness
body
is
medium
medium
carbonation
level
easy
drinking
and
smooth
another
good
beer
in
a
can
tastee
pours
darker
than
most
pale
lagers
that
ive
had
not
much
smell
some
malts
a
little
hops
has
a
very
nice
malty
flavor
and
a
hop
bite
no
fillers
or
adjuncts
in
there
what
so
ever
smooth
taste
and
much
better
than
any
macro
lager
out
there
very
nice
amber
body
continually
pierced
by
light
carbonation
fine
ad
rocky
white
head
topped
it
all
off
for
a
little
while
before
the
mass
melted
into
a
thin
layer
of
sticky
fluff
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
and
uncomplicated
beer
lightly
hopped
and
modest
malt
this
beer
has
always
reminded
me
of
a
good
version
of
yuengling
lager
strange
metallic
flavors
build
on
the
finish
the
more
you
drink
i
hope
this
is
never
the
first
brooklyn
beer
that
anyone
tries
its
not
bad
but
when
compared
to
their
other
brews
it
is
nothing
great
i
dont
know
how
much
the
order
of
beers
had
determines
how
tastey
they
all
are
but
this
was
the
last
i
tried
tonight
and
boy
was
it
good
usually
the
last
beer
i
have
tastes
the
worst
because
i
fail
to
adequately
cleanse
my
palate
but
tonight
was
an
exception
im
tasting
a
remarkable
hop
content
for
a
lager
almost
enough
to
make
it
a
pale
ale
in
fact
that
would
make
sense
since
it
has
a
bold
amber
coloration
a
notably
fruity
nose
makes
brooklyn
lager
especially
unique
tastes
pretty
damn
good
will
probably
buy
again
this
and
that
bla
bla
bla
drinkability
a
very
versatile
beer
a
light
enough
style
to
be
a
session
beer
all
by
itself
but
enough
character
to
stand
up
admirably
if
paired
with
food
i
suspect
the
hops
would
hold
their
own
reasonably
well
with
wings
or
barbecue
clear
and
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
malty
with
some
citrusy
hops
taste
starts
out
sweet
like
caramel
with
a
zesty
lemony
finish
very
bitter
in
the
finish
which
may
not
please
most
beer
drinking
novices
not
the
best
from
brooklyn
but
its
a
classic
in
the
microbrewing
industry
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
sample
tasting
cup
it
pours
a
classic
amber
color
with
one
rocky
finger
of
head
there
is
lots
of
lacing
left
on
the
cup
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
slightly
grassy
hops
the
taste
starts
with
rich
malt
and
ends
with
a
good
dose
of
hops
pretty
hoppy
for
a
lager
the
balance
is
very
nice
the
body
is
a
little
light
but
very
smooth
the
drinkability
is
great
and
this
is
good
to
go
for
the
summer
noticable
hop
presence
on
the
nose
which
surprised
me
nice
crisp
taste
slightly
toasted
malt
and
crisp
hop
finish
more
hops
than
i
ever
would
have
thought
from
a
lager
very
crisp
and
refreshing
medium
body
nicely
carbonated
taste
is
less
full
less
gas
filled
and
much
crisper
and
more
refreshing
than
a
boston
lager
this
could
be
the
perfect
grilling
beer
this
beer
poured
a
copper
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
off
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
some
carbonation
is
also
present
one
of
the
darkest
lagers
i
have
ever
seen
an
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
are
present
with
a
touch
of
caramel
a
flavor
of
malt
and
caramel
a
rather
crisp
and
light
finish
to
it
the
coloration
and
the
flavor
isnt
bad
but
i
guess
this
brewer
is
trying
to
point
to
an
older
way
of
brewing
lagers
like
victorys
does
pours
a
medium
golden
color
topped
by
a
solid
white
head
that
shows
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
is
more
malty
than
most
and
a
little
light
on
overall
aroma
faint
hop
notes
are
also
evident
the
taste
is
fairly
malty
for
a
lager
but
it
has
a
substantial
hop
bite
on
the
finish
i
was
actually
surprised
by
the
overall
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
the
overall
package
makes
for
a
supremely
drinakble
beer
ill
revisit
it
later
after
my
initial
impression
fades
a
bit
but
i
have
to
get
this
one
in
the
fridge
soon
in
the
transition
tho
i
cannot
get
past
a
syrupy
presence
that
i
find
annoying
one
of
my
favorite
us
lagers
pours
an
amber
with
orange
hue
and
shortlived
offwhite
head
nice
malty
and
floral
hop
aroma
mostly
a
trailing
lace
with
some
clinging
residue
lightly
sweet
caramel
notes
within
a
nice
rounded
malt
body
sharp
citrusy
bitterness
and
a
light
metallic
edge
a
hint
of
pears
appears
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
as
the
flavors
meld
and
balance
it
went
down
nice
the
aftertaste
was
pleasent
to
the
palet
a
nice
crisp
lager
overall
a
good
lager
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
give
this
one
a
try
this
beer
poured
a
very
bright
and
clear
amber
orange
color
decent
frothy
white
head
wonderfully
inviting
and
slightly
flowery
hop
aroma
nice
malt
presence
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
is
a
great
tasting
lager
smooth
and
mellow
and
very
flavorful
perfect
carbonation
its
a
definite
step
up
from
a
normal
premium
lager
thanks
stegmakk
for
the
bottle
this
is
a
true
amber
colored
beer
pours
an
average
head
that
fades
quickly
but
provides
excellent
lacing
smells
of
flowers
and
sugar
good
tasting
lager
a
little
sweet
but
enough
other
flavors
in
there
too
somewhat
thick
in
the
mouth
but
more
drinkable
than
your
average
lager
a
great
standby
beer
well
i
bought
a
sampler
without
looking
at
the
date
and
its
best
by
date
is
august
2002
however
it
is
against
my
religion
to
toss
a
beer
without
at
least
trying
it
first
pours
a
beautiful
amber
gold
with
a
creamy
white
foaming
head
this
beer
is
forming
nice
even
rings
of
lace
looking
quite
beautiful
in
my
stemmed
stella
artois
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
musky
with
some
mild
hops
and
a
very
mild
hint
of
malt
sweetness
with
all
things
considered
mainly
the
age
of
this
beer
not
bad
at
all
the
taste
is
where
the
age
starts
to
hurt
this
beer
it
still
has
a
nice
grainy
sweetness
with
some
bittering
hops
thrown
in
but
overall
just
a
little
stale
what
did
i
expect
from
a
lager
this
old
i
remind
you
that
this
beer
is
still
a
cut
above
most
beers
out
there
just
i
will
definitely
have
to
resample
due
to
the
age
of
the
product
mouthfeel
is
still
very
carbonated
with
a
nice
nutty
malt
thickness
to
the
finish
overall
i
bet
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
but
i
am
going
to
update
this
review
to
find
out
for
sure
sparkling
crystal
bronze
color
the
carbonation
bubbles
can
easily
be
observed
although
not
overly
malty
for
the
style
this
lager
bordered
on
alelike
qualities
the
hops
were
interesting
although
not
overly
floral
they
did
lend
a
distinct
aromatic
quality
and
the
bittering
aspect
was
almost
secondary
overall
a
nicely
crafted
brew
a
translucent
deep
amber
to
copper
color
on
the
pour
a
prestigious
bright
white
head
generous
lace
and
a
nice
clean
and
crisp
nose
start
is
loaded
with
malt
somewhat
sweet
the
top
is
moderate
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
with
the
finish
stinging
in
its
acidity
the
hops
stout
in
their
spiciness
dry
aftertaste
a
great
drinking
beer
i
like
it
this
lager
had
a
dark
amber
appearance
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
very
attractive
looking
beer
complete
with
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
equally
impressive
with
clove
and
citrus
elements
here
and
there
the
taste
threw
me
of
a
bit
however
an
indescribable
tangy
quality
distracted
me
from
the
otherwise
wellbalanced
brew
a
hint
of
orange
or
citrus
combined
with
a
yeasty
quality
that
didnt
sit
well
with
me
while
the
taste
was
definitely
something
different
i
cant
say
that
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
mediocre
smooth
overall
but
with
a
somewhat
grainy
feel
on
the
tongue
ive
had
better
lagers
even
from
larger
breweries
the
brooklyn
lager
wasnt
terrible
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
choice
among
a
variety
from
the
same
style
this
beer
was
a
real
surprise
to
me
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
the
single
bottle
i
bought
from
a
split
pack
primarily
because
of
the
pricing
surprise
this
is
a
very
good
lager
but
i
believed
it
is
misclassified
as
a
pale
lager
this
seems
much
more
to
me
vienna
style
the
color
is
deep
ambercopper
with
a
very
good
goldish
tan
head
that
lasts
reasonable
well
the
lacing
is
also
very
good
mucho
hops
on
the
head
aroma
more
maltlike
as
the
head
dissipates
great
refreshing
taste
with
more
hops
than
expected
creamy
mouthfeel
thoroughly
enjoyable
drinkability
a
wonderful
lager
i
almost
do
not
believe
this
is
a
lager
yummy
one
of
the
better
micro
breweries
brooklyn
has
done
a
fine
job
with
the
various
tasks
they
have
attempted
but
it
is
always
nice
to
come
back
to
an
old
stand
by
such
as
the
lager
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
lager
was
presented
in
a
20oz
glass
and
it
was
a
rich
mahogony
color
with
a
fine
white
head
with
an
interesting
thin
clingy
lace
the
smell
was
sharp
with
lemon
and
hop
aromas
the
interesting
part
about
this
beer
is
that
it
tastes
much
like
a
pale
ale
or
bitter
with
that
distinct
hop
taste
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
though
and
not
nearly
as
heavy
tasting
as
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
beer
you
can
always
count
on
and
it
is
pretty
easy
to
find
to
boot
had
a
great
thick
rocky
and
fluffy
head
that
shrank
in
a
few
minutes
leaving
a
merange
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
color
was
a
deep
copper
and
very
clear
thea
smell
was
full
of
hops
and
some
maltyness
as
well
texture
was
thinner
than
i
had
expected
but
still
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
tastes
reminded
me
very
much
of
sam
adams
which
i
have
had
many
time
before
this
lager
tastes
was
a
mild
sweet
maltyness
upfront
followed
by
complex
hop
character
in
the
end
hops
left
a
grapefruit
and
lingering
aftertaste
but
was
not
overpowering
good
overall
but
i
think
i
would
stick
to
sa
if
i
wanted
this
type
of
full
flavored
lager
light
copper
hop
oils
form
patches
of
head
aroma
was
nice
spicy
hop
taste
was
a
caramel
flavor
that
did
not
integrate
very
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
there
was
a
little
lemon
zest
the
one
nice
surprise
was
the
floral
notes
in
the
flavor
of
the
hops
easy
drinking
but
why
would
you
buy
one
when
sa
boston
lager
is
more
easily
found
and
tastes
somewhat
similar
and
much
better
i
suppose
this
beer
is
supposed
to
provide
a
stepup
from
tasteless
lagers
which
it
does
rather
well
i
guess
as
the
bottle
states
its
a
goldenamber
brew
good
sized
white
head
with
decent
staying
power
leaves
some
patchy
lace
as
it
goes
down
clean
crisp
aroma
of
floral
hops
and
sweet
grainy
malt
as
for
the
taste
again
its
very
crisp
and
clean
quite
flavorful
though
hop
oil
and
grainy
malt
make
up
most
of
the
flavor
profile
has
a
nice
pinpoint
bitterness
to
it
as
well
smooth
and
refreshing
all
the
way
through
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
a
bit
better
great
casual
drinking
beer
thanks
to
francisweizen
for
this
one
these
guys
have
proven
that
in
an
age
of
can
you
top
this
in
the
hop
and
alcohol
contest
a
good
solid
beer
can
be
enjoyed
now
that
i
have
found
a
reliable
supplier
for
this
stuff
my
fridge
will
always
have
some
on
hand
also
a
great
beer
to
serve
to
the
casual
macro
drinker
who
is
turned
off
by
the
mega
brews
like
all
brooklyn
brews
a
great
hoppy
nose
floral
hops
hallertauer
and
cascade
a
slightly
malty
taste
but
very
much
a
barley
malt
as
it
has
a
tart
fruity
tone
that
finishes
on
a
slightly
acidic
bitter
reminiscent
of
nuts
without
being
a
truly
nutty
beer
opens
to
an
even
larger
soft
fruityfloral
nose

quite
nice
due
to
dryhopping
very
good
lager
bitterness
in
its
balance
amongst
the
flavors

not
too
strong
but
definitively
a
major
presence
a
good
brew
that
i
like
to
have
around
as
for
as
an
ny
resident
its
much
better
than
anything
else
in
its
price
range
a
thanks
goes
out
to
francisweizen
for
this
bottle
in
a
nutshell
a
good
cleancrisp
american
pilsner
this
one
poured
a
sparkling
deep
golden
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
and
lots
of
tiny
rising
bubbles
nice
german
hop
aroma
saaz
grassy
and
a
touch
herbal
it
has
a
malty
start
that
quickly
vanishes
to
a
light
hop
bitter
finish
a
nice
dry
and
crisp
beer
that
would
go
well
on
a
hot
day
it
would
also
go
well
with
pizza
or
burgers
not
fantastic
but
solid
lager
the
way
it
should
be
made
here
was
suprised
at
the
great
appearance
of
this
one
great
golden
colorwirh
a
great
foamy
head
had
freas
mowed
grass
fruity
amoma
almost
like
a
ipa
one
of
the
hoppiest
lagers
i
have
had
if
not
the
most
refreshing
quaffer
with
some
substancei
can
see
why
alot
of
people
give
this
brew
good
marks
its
firm
head
and
rich
color
give
brooklyns
lager
and
appetizing
appearance
its
soft
nose
is
followed
by
a
dry
refreshing
finish
that
begs
for
another
sip
brooklyns
standard
beer
is
itself
a
standard
for
american
lagers
while
better
lagers
exist
few
exemplify
the
style
better
than
brooklyn
does
and
is
an
essential
component
to
an
august
cookout
an
awesome
clear
gold
color
and
a
bright
white
head
tops
of
this
larger
a
citrushoppy
aroma
is
present
very
clean
the
taste
is
just
as
clean
with
a
fine
mixture
of
hops
and
malt
nice
mouth
feel
and
very
drinkable
im
starting
to
enjoy
the
beers
of
the
brooklyn
brewery
cant
wait
to
i
find
more
high
drinkability
as
the
taste
is
mild
and
pleasant
combined
with
a
low
to
moderate
alcohol
makes
this
a
beer
you
can
drink
all
night
pours
a
slightly
chill
hazed
copper
with
a
thin
but
persistent
head
that
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lace
aroma
is
malty
caramel
and
toasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
spicy
noble
hops
flavor
is
malty
beginning
with
some
sweet
caramel
notes
moving
to
bread
and
some
finishing
spicy
bitterness
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
rough
with
a
medium
body
this
is
a
very
well
done
amber
lager
this
beer
poured
onto
the
glass
a
medium
to
dark
gold
color
the
head
was
of
a
full
consistency
and
the
color
of
white
the
aroma
was
a
balance
of
malts
and
hops
the
taste
was
exactly
like
the
aroma
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malts
balancing
each
other
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
of
beer
that
it
represents
clear
golden
in
colour
fluffy
white
head
good
smooth
with
some
prevalent
hop
flavours
as
well
as
malt
sweetness
finish
is
initially
smooth
with
some
bitterness
trailing
at
the
very
end
good
but
not
great
the
only
down
fall
was
the
slight
bitter
hops
a
little
to
bitter
for
a
lager
but
all
and
all
a
good
beer
easy
to
drink
tasted
at
the
barrelhouse
brewing
company
microbrew
fest
on
november
9
honeycolored
with
with
a
minimal
head
dry
hops
flavor
with
a
decent
finish
not
on
the
same
scale
as
the
black
chocolate
stout
but
decent
nonetheless
pours
a
nice
golden
colour
with
nice
white
head
well
carbonated
and
quite
refreshing
quite
nice
beer
on
average
with
nice
appearance
good
taste
but
must
be
enjoyed
really
cold
for
maximum
satisfaction
this
is
a
pretty
good
bear
i
got
it
in
a
six
pack
in
a
variety
case
of
brooklyn
beersa
good
purchase
and
one
that
i
would
suggest
to
all
of
you
who
are
unfamiliar
with
this
breweries
excellent
line
of
beersnot
that
i
am
partial
to
it
or
anything
considering
i
am
from
brooklyn
originally
anyway
this
purs
a
darkish
amber
colour
which
is
not
that
different
from
a
boston
lager
it
also
smells
like
a
boston
lager
and
features
the
same
head
imo
basically
this
tases
like
boston
lager
as
well
but
with
a
bigger
mouthfeel
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
is
the
aftertaste
which
is
a
little
too
harsh
for
me
to
handleat
least
for
this
style
in
a
pale
ale
i
look
for
a
more
hoppy
harsh
finish
either
way
a
nice
beer
and
good
to
have
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
pours
a
dark
golden
color
maybe
amber
the
head
is
a
offwhite
color
and
very
small
but
holds
pretty
well
on
the
nose
the
aroma
is
clean
with
a
hint
of
malts
on
the
palate
there
is
a
smooth
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
hop
bite
woody
rich
and
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
seems
like
this
would
be
a
good
fall
back
beer
pours
pale
clear
and
carbonated
with
a
surprisingly
shortlived
head
the
beer
has
a
decent
hop
aroma
and
terrific
malthop
balance
finish
is
a
little
sweet
for
a
pilsener
but
still
very
enjoyable
well
made
no
apparent
flaws
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
aroma
of
fresh
hops
well
balanced
malty
to
hopsmaybe
just
a
bit
hoppier
than
expected
also
has
a
touch
of
lemon
an
excellent
lager
i
really
enjoyed
it
a
great
blend
of
malt
and
hops
this
beer
was
just
a
good
lager
it
was
very
nice
on
the
way
down
without
overpowering
carbonation
i
will
have
it
again
soon
it
is
worth
the
time
to
get
this
beer
clear
amber
body
with
some
carbonation
white
fluffy
head
good
clean
nose
smells
like
good
beer
malt
is
first
on
the
tongue
with
hops
right
behind
good
balance
between
the
new
york
sam
adams
and
both
are
contract
brewed
out
of
their
hometowns
a
beer
that
can
be
overlooked
by
those
searching
for
the
next
outrageous
ipa
or
imperial
stout
but
this
is
the
one
of
the
bedrock
brews
that
can
be
used
to
convert
the
more
willing
budmillercoors
folks
always
good
to
have
a
few
around
my
prejudice
made
with
the
old
schafer
yeast
strain
my
dad
always
drank
schafer
so
this
is
my
link
this
and
sas
boston
lager
are
my
2
fallbacks
this
is
just
as
sturdy
and
reliable
although
surprisingly
full
for
a
standard
lager
it
aint
your
runofthemill
watereddown
american
brew
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
hoppy
pale
ale
rich
woody
and
complex
goes
great
with
all
kinds
of
food
or
a
fine
centerpiece
when
drinking
is
the
only
matter
at
hand
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
a
great
everyday
drinking
beer
it
one
of
those
must
haves
in
the
fridge
very
nice
lager
goes
will
all
kinds
of
food
keeps
its
flavor
until
the
last
drop
an
okay
lager
notes
good
drinking
all
around
this
is
a
traditional
lager
with
all
the
characteristics
one
would
expect
from
the
preprohibition
beer
as
it
states
on
the
label
o
a
tasty
amber
lager
with
an
aroma
that
could
use
some
work
i
would
happily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
o
good
bot
nothing
to
seek
out
discovered
creemore
on
tap
at
doolys
in
fredericton
new
brunswick
canada
my
hometown
and
loved
it
began
trying
all
their
products
i
could
get
my
hands
on
im
by
no
means
an
expert
im
still
experimenting
with
different
beers
but
creemore
products
especially
the
lager
and
bock
are
definitely
my
favorite
as
of
yet
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
im
general
a
big
yes
as
a
lager
this
is
one
of
the
best
it
goes
down
very
easily
a
little
bit
on
the
watery
after
taste
but
overall
there
is
nothing
to
complain
expect
that
the
price
is
a
bit
hight
compare
to
a
moosehead
but
way
much
better
taste
than
the
competition
pours
a
copper
like
amber
color
with
a
creamy
two
finger
head
creemore
springs
has
hints
of
hops
and
sweet
caramel
that
is
a
pleasant
tasting
beer
and
remains
a
top
notch
beer
to
enjoy
time
and
time
again
for
me
this
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
from
ontario
and
its
among
my
favorite
beers
pretty
darn
good
creamytoasted
malt
and
hops
are
well
balanced
o
good
beer
and
could
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
or
anchor
steam
nice
surprise
this
is
much
more
than
i
was
expecting

one
of
my
preferred
beers
ive
only
encountered
them
in
tall
cans
and
thats
fine
with
me
will
gladly
drink
this
beer
if
given
the
option
sampled
on
tap
at
an
irish
pub
in
calgary
this
brew
arrived
in
a
pint
glass
a
really
nice
russet

color
veering
towards

and
with
billowing
white
foam
that
retained

well

i
kid
creemore
is
a

lager
brewery
and
this
is
their
flagship
for
a
reason
was
good
enough
to
distract
me
from
the
fights

very
drinkable
good
for
more
than
one
any
time
one
of
my
favorite
canadian
beers
did
anyone
else
realize
that
this
is
in
the
same
style
category
as
brooklyn
and
old
scratch
this
comes
off
more
like
a
macro
lager
or
maybe
in
the
same
ballpark
as
yuengling
i
feel
like
im
in
crazy
town
reading
other
reviews
i
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
even
for
the
style
creemore
is
an
iconic
brewery
in
ontario
and
it
earned
that
reputation
with
good
reason
its
flagship
lager
one
of
the
few
premium
lagers
to
actually
use
the
word
in
its
true
sense
is
flavourful
clean
distinctive
and
pleasurably
drinkable
it
is
a
magnificent
example
of
unpasteurized
uncompromising
smallbatch
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
pours
a
tawny
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
leaves
some
specks
of
lace
aroma
is
dominated
by
biscuity
malts
and
a
bit
grainy
a
touch
of
musty
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
pretty
impressive
a
doughy
biscuit
maltiness
with
a
well
balanced
light
hop
bitterness
very
surprised
with
this
one
mouthfeel
is
a
hint
above
light
and
it
finishes
a
touch
dry
very
drinkable
brew
id
gladly
have
it
again
d
very
delicious
summer
beer
can
easily
have
a
few
pitchers
of
this
pours
a
crisp
clear
golden
lager
colour
with
a
wonderful
white
head
that
caps
about
12
cm
tall
with
lacing
as
you
drink
aromas
of
spicy
hops
above
a
bready
malt
the
beer
itself
is
an
enjoyable
bready
malt
with
a
light
bitterness
and
a
crisp
finish
nice
carbonation
and
an
enjoyably
drinkable
beer
to
cap
a
2200
km

dlike
i
said
its
a
fridge
staple
im
happy
to
see
this
on
tap
in
a
few
bars
in
calgary
a
much
better
beer
compared
most
of
the
macros
even
though
its
owned
by
molson
just
a
stand
up
brew
my
default
draught
choice
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
canadian
red
look
no
further
overall
i
really
like
this
lager
creemore
produces
a
delicious
beer
which
is
perfect
for
when
youre
lounging
on
a
sunny
afternoon
or
vegging
on
the
couch
the
mellow
flavour
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
its
great
to
see
that
despite
being
owned
by
a
macro
this
brewery
were
allowed
to
stick
to
their
guns
a
great
local
lager
and
thanks
to
molsons
wildly
available
in
mainstream
bars
making
it
one
of
my
go
to
bar
drafts
overall
a
nice
enjoyable
light
amber
lager
with
some
nicely
layered
flavors
an
enjoyable
interpretation
of
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
though
im
certainly
a
long
way
away
from
the
days
when
i
thought
this
was
the
best
beer
i
had
ever
tried
this
beer
is
obviously
meant
to
be
drinkable
and
it
is
i
pretty
much
only
buy
this
beer
when
tankhouse
isnt
available
tankhouse
and
creemore
being
the
two
drinkable
beers
youll
find
either
of
at
any
given
drinking
establishment
in
toronto
but
am
glad
to
have
it
to
fall
back
on
since
theres
not
much
else
to
count
on
here
in
ontario
clear
amberorange
with
a
ring
of
white
head
and
spots
of
lace
smell
is
light
fruity
hops
citrus
strong
tangerine
aroma
bready
malts
fresh
yeast
as
well
taste
is
toasted
biscuit
caramel
grassy
and
herbal
hops
mildly
citric
with
a
big
punch
of
whole
wheat
cracker
in
the
aftertaste
like
triscuits
without
the
salt
its
hard
to
describe
but
theres
an
off
emptiness
in
the
flavour
that
takes
this
beer
down
a
notch
from
brooklyn
lager
the
natural
comparison
mouthfeel
is
delicate
and
silky
medium
carbonation
balanced
malthop
finish
good
session
beer
more
complex
than
your
average
lager
respected
by
craft
drinkers
accessible
to
macro
lovers
a
canadian
classic
d
it
would
be
extremely
easy
to
put
back
several
of
these
babies
this
is
a
lager
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
lot
of
character
easily
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
damn
tasty
and
evenly
balanced
hard
to
even
began
to
describe
the
taste
excepts
that
its
smooth
and
creamy
its
one
of
a
kind
its
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
an
exceptional
beer
all
around
thats
a
pleasure
to
drink
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
on
tap
pours
a
clear
amber
pretty
fucking
bland
to
be
honest
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
beer
considering
the
overall
rating
it
has
locally
definately
overrated
after
taste
was
annoying
and
after
two
pints
i
actually
quit
drinking
that
night
pretty
disappointing
mouthfeel
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
the
diacetyl
provides
some
slickness
into
the
finish
a
nice
medium
level
of
carbonation
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
always
try
to
ger
my
hands
on
some
when
im
up
north
a
must
tryin
my
opionion
its
just
a
great
simple
straight
forwardgood
tasting
brew
wish
it
was
more
available
to
us
here
in
the
states
but
it
definetly
makes
a
trip
to
the
falls
well
worth
the
time
d
outstandingly
drinkable
even
more
so
on
tap
this
is
nectar
of
the
gods
status
for
this
style
truly
world
class
and
brewed
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
which
is
bonus
for
me
this
beer
is
a
musttry
for
any
lover
of
the
pale
lager
style
full
of
flavor
and
its
slightly
high
price
is
worth
every
penny
d
flavourful
and
easy
to
drink
has
become
one
of
the
staples
in
my
fridge
overall
a
great
pale
lager
beer
one
of
the
best
in
canadian
beer
stores
light
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
coupled
with
an
exceptional
taste
profile
for
the
style
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
this
is
one
ill
keep
around
during
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
recommended
clear
copper
with
a
small
creamy
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
few
scraps
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
toasted
grain
and
caramel
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
pretty
tasty
kind
of
the
boston
lager
of
canada
nice
and
clean
with
biscuity
malt
and
herbal
hop
notes
medium
light
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
easily
the
best
non
unibroue
canadian
beer
ive
had
a
good
lager
sample
500
ml
bottle
dark
amber
coloured
body
very
nice
aromas
of
some
malt
and
hops
in
the
background
i
also
got
a
whiff
of
fruit
taste
is
hoppy
fresh
and
a
tad
sweet
of
malts
a
very
distinctive
taste
in
my
opinion
it
went
down
very
easily
fuller
bodied
than
your
typical
macro
lager
carbonation
just
shy
of
moderate
lightens
it
up
a
little
clean
simple
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
solid
lager
creemore
springs
pours
a
light
copper
a
bit
darker
than
your
average
macro
lager
the
aroma
is
slightly
grainy
with
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
and
slightly
herbal
hops
the
flavor
shows
a
similar
profile
just
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
nice
but
mild
hop
flavor
overall
the
beer
is
nice
and
refreshing
after
a
run
and
a
swim
this
is
a
great
session
beer
the
best
widely
available
ontario
beer
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
many
of
these
cold
and
refreshing
natural
flavours
goes
down
easy
active
carbonation
about
par
for
the
style
definitely
drinkable
but
still
just
too
light
and
with
too
many
vague
flavors
for
me
to
pick
it
up
unless
its
the
only
choice
definitely
sessionable
drinks
very
lightly
is
quite
clean
and
finishes
off
as
such
great
beer
at
graffitis
to
catch
a
show
there
had
on
tap
at
the
loose
moose
in
toronto
definitely
recommended
id
enjoy
this
most
in
spring
and
fall
and
on
summer
evenings
after
the
heat
of
the
day
or
quite
easily
in
winter
after
hockey
too
you
know
youre
about
to
have
a
good
lager
as
soon
as
you
see
it
pours
a
clear
shiny
copper
color
with
some
good
lacework
on
the
glass
slightly
grassy
aroma
the
flavor
is
fresh
toasty
with
a
crisp
bitterness
nothing
very
fancy
and
pleasure
is
in
the
simplicity
very
enjoyable
to
drink
and
paired
well
with
asian
chicken
salad
i
had
really
intensified
the
flavors
of
the
dressing
proof
that
great
beer
can
come
in
a
lager
a
wellbalanced
easydrinking
enjoyable
lager
heres
a
well
put
together
lager
seems
like
it
couldnt
have
suffered
much
from
being
bought
out
by
molson
overall
an
excellent
american
pale
lager
smooth
creamy
well
balanced
and
not
lacking
in
flavour
decently
priced
here
in
ontario
i
could
definately
see
this
beer
being
one
of
my
summer
saviors
good
auroma
and
even
better
flavors
i
was
fairly
suprised
by
this
beer
not
amazing
but
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
if
i
can
find
it
final
thoughts
this
is
a
good
and
solid
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
exceptional
by
any
means
but
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
stuff
at
a
restaurant
any
day
or
if
i
just
wanted
a
single
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
a
case
of
it
especially
since
it
needs
to
be
drunk
quick
due
to
the
lack
of
preservatives
and
pasteurization
but
i
would
love
getting
this
stuff
on
tap
d
good
session
beer
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
and
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
wanting
something
with
some
substance
id
say
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
an
evening
with
company
carbonated
mouthfeel
this
beer
fills
you
up
fast
on
tap
though
other
than
that
a
very
good
lager
notes
from
72905
a
generally
agreeable
somewhat
robust
and
overall
tasty
lager
i
get
a
weird
sense
of
wholeness
with
this
one
something
even
beyond
the
obvious
eschewing
of
adjuncts
theres
still
pride
here
the
kind
that
stubbornly
persists
after
a
family
member
does
something
unpleasant
or
just
plain
silly
eric
d
very
drinkable
better
mouthfeel
and
more
of
a
soft
carbonation
on
tap
than
the
bottle
version
the
flavours
compliment
seemed
more
pronounced
when
the
beer
began
to
warm
happy
to
have
ordered
it
highly
recomended
and
try
to
find
as
fresh
as
possible
drinkability
a
sigh
of
relief
that
theres
going
to
be
a
beer
i
can
have
here
at
the
airport
travel
here
about
once
a
week
very
smooth
refreshing
and
a
quite
tasty
lager
here
had
this
at
the
keg
in
ottawa
on
and
at
the
ottawa
intl
airport
a
solid
lager
seemed
more
like
a
pilsner
nice
mouthfeel
and
very
crisp
and
refreshing
no
noticeable
hops
though
had
on
tap
at
the
keg
and
the
bottle
version
was
actually
much
better
rereview
after
trying
this
again
i
think
i
was
unfair
the
first
time
around
this
is
a
very
nice
lager
with
some
flavourful
caramel
malt
and
a
nice
crisp
hop
finish
delivers
the
style
quite
well
i
could
enjoy
23
of
thes
on
a
warm
day
very
well
balanced
with
both
the
malt
and
hops
reaching
high
compares
to
most
north
american
lagers
this
would
be
my
mainstay
or
fallback
beer
if
it
was
readily
available
to
me
seek
this
one
out
i
was
expecting
something
much
worse
than
this
after
i
drainpoured
their
traditional
pilsner
given
that
you
can
find
creemore
at
a
lot
of
mainstream
bars
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
a
very
good
tasting
beer
very
satisfying
a
good
lager
to
enjoy
a
sandwich
with
or
your
favorite
pasta
with
a
cream
sauce
pint
at
madisons
during
a
lightning
visit
by
an
australian
friend
amber
body
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
film
light
bready
aroma
mild
caramel
malt
flavour
and
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
lager
is
not
my
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
decent
and
would
help
change
my
mind
this
is
a
drinkable
malty
lager
there
are
maltier
lagers
or
ales
but
this
is
alright
d
quite
easy
to
drink
better
than
the
heineken
or
rickards
also
on
tap
at
the
bar
a
good
basic
beer
when
wanting
some
flavour
but
no
big
surprises
i
tried
this
beer
on
august
24
2007
at
kelseys
in
milton
the
beer
was
a
beautiful
coppery
colour
with
a
one
finger
head
the
aroma
was
very
faint
to
nonexistant
disappointing
to
say
the
least
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
mild
carbonation
the
flavour
was
mild
a
little
malty
and
a
little
bitter
i
may
try
this
beer
again
im
not
a
fan
of
lagers
so
i
was
hesitant
to
try
this
but
once
i
tried
it
i
liked
it
the
appearance
is
nice
a
clear
pinkishorange
and
with
a
thin
frothy
foam
head
the
taste
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
its
difficult
to
describe
the
taste
in
detail
other
than
to
say
it
was
crisp
and
clean
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
can
really
compliment
a
hearty
to
medium
meal
now
it
seems
to
be
a
blend
of
the
original
creemore
and
molson
canadian
actually
more
like
a
molson
canadian
with
a
hint
of
creemore
in
it
this
is
typical
of
how
a
large
massproducing
giant
takes
on
a
smaller
craft
beer
and
streamlines
the
recipe
and
process
to
maximize
profits
just
my
2
cents
poured
out
a
copper
orange
color
with
a
bubbly
off
white
head
thick
then
faded
to
a
thin
film
in
under
a
minute
the
nose
ummm
lets
see
i
guess
something
right
maybe
some
faint
malt
i
could
be
lieing
though
now
on
to
the
taste
ok
some
toasty
malt
not
much
and
it
dissapears
quickly
but
it
was
there
has
a
slight
bitter
hoppy
finish
as
well
light
bodies
with
medium
carbonation
very
clean
finish
nothing
great
here
but
nothing
offensive
sweet
malt
flavors
with
hints
of
caramel
toasted
grains
are
a
bit
lighter
than
in
the
nose
buttery
floral
hop
presence
but
this
one
is
all
malt
here
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
high
and
sucked
the
wind
out
of
the
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
toasted
grain
aftertaste
a
nice
lager
from
our
friends
from
the
north
overall
i
love
drinking
this
beer
with
a
nice
pot
roast
or
something
it
pairs
excellently
with
lots
of
types
of
food
salmon
worked
really
well
great
all
natural
probably
one
of
the
best
lager
beers
in
canada
had
ontap
in
windsor
its
clear
brownred
with
a
small
foam
head
that
fades
quickly
decent
amount
of
bubbles
nose
is
grains
and
corn
not
the
best
but
it
smells
like
a
lager
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
a
musty
graincorn
blend
with
slight
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
or
just
below
same
for
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
bland
very
nice
sweet
and
drinkable
good
thick
and
white
great
foam
nice
colour
between
gold
and
sunny
the
taste
is
not
tiring
reminds
me
a
little
the
polish
lagers
but
it
has
its
own
canadian
character
i
like
this
kind
of
lagers
they
do
not
taste
like
crap
one
heck
of
a
session
beer
if
nothing
else
with
so
many
mediocre
beers
calling
themselves
all
malt
these
days
its
nice
to
see
what
a
real
example
of
the
style
can
be
like
its
also
nice
to
see
craft
beer
in
cans
taste
is
just
plain
awkward
i
think
i
know
what
theyre
trying
to
do
with
this
one
and
the
hop
presence
scores
it
some
points
but
the
malt
is
nearly
nonexistent
unless
that
sour
adjuncty
soapiness
is
supposed
to
be
it
mouth
is
sticky
with
a
zippy
carbonation
dry
this
is
drinkable
and
more
unique
than
a
lot
of
lagers
out
there
but
in
my
opinion
its
pretty
poorly
executed
unfortunate
this
is
sad
because
i
liked
this
beer
and
have
bought
it
for
years
but
there
are
now
several
better
premium
micro
lagers
with
richer
import
malts
and
fresher
taste
these
days
a
rather
nice
allmalt
lager
pours
out
to
a
deep
orange
gold
color
with
a
lively
head
of
white
foam
that
stays
consistantly
dense
and
large
rings
of
lace
are
present
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
rich
roasted
caramel
malts
and
wheaty
grains
mixed
with
a
touch
of
wood
nice
taste
is
well
rounded
and
very
enjoyable
caramel
malts
light
wood
notes
smooth
rich
grain
a
touch
of
earth
the
slightest
nip
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
but
not
overly
carbonated
almost
not
enough
carbonation
honestly
drinkability
is
north
of
average
a
well
made
lager
recommended
overall
an
acceptable
beer
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
d
quite
good
easy
drinking
session
beer
much
much
better
fresh
on
tap
taste
is
quite
pleasant
and
i
always
like
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
smoother
and
creamier
than
commercial
lagers
and
one
of
the
best
of
the
region
quite
malty
but
wellbalanced
like
i
said
a
shortlasting
but
satisfyingly
bitter
aftertaste
a
little
bit
of
a
cracker
flavour
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
red
grape
flavour
in
the
very
very
back
creemore
claims
to
be
proudly
behind
the
times
and
in
this
some
nut
perhaps
and
a
gentle
bitterness
and
maybe
a
touch
of
tart
citrus
in
the
finish
nutty
and
fruity
in
the
nose
lightmedium
in
body
im
a
bit
confused
drinkability
remains
decent
a
canadian
standard
if
nothing
else
slight
malty
well
balanced
with
floralhop
bitterness
clean
very
little
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
flavor
is
upfront
sweet
and
is
mixed
nicely
by
hoppy
influence
finish
is
dry
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
was
quite
pleasantly
surprised
at
this
good
that
is
what
i
respect
about
this
beer

this
is
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
lager
beer

with
some

a

beer
overall
not
a

would
like
a

but
this
is
ok
i
could
definitely
session
this
beer
all
day
it
reminds

a

of
boston
lager
except
i

this
full

offering
tastes
and
feels
superior

on

ill
be

is
a
solid
beer
and
has
lots
of
characteristics
that
remind
me
of
my
alltime
favorite
amber
full
sail
amber
after
the
initial
let
down
of
a
nose
no
better
than
youre
average
middleoftheroad
craft
e
g
dundee
lager
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
a
relatively
complex
and
interesting
flavor
profile
i
would
consider
adding
this
probably
as
a
last
option
to
a
mixasix
again
apperance
of
a
nice
deep
red
orange
condensed
foamy
thick
head
did
not
dissipate
too
quick
smells
of
roasted
malt
some
marshmellows
roasted
malt
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
off
the
bat
maybe
even
marshmellows
smooth
lager
finish
not
even
week
at
6
percent
abv
barely
any
hop
bitterness
like
the
malty
dominance
good
medium
body
mouth
feel
with
great
carbonation
it
does
look
like
a
mini
aquarium
in
my
mug
of
bubbles
like
a
good
beer
should
who
likes
a
flat
beer
huh
overall
a
good
brew
especially
for
the
red
or
amber
beer
color
fans
overall
a
rather
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
amber
ale
rjt
the
verdict
not
bad
fairly
well
balanced
it
does
a
decent
job
of
trying
to
convert
you
to
lagerism
as
the
label
suggests
not
the
best
example
but
ill
take
it
over
a
samuel
adams
low
c
a
pretty
good
lager
the
body
was
nicely
smooth
and
full
a
bit
creamy
and
had
a
medium
finish
drinkability
was
ok
but
that
odd
taste
was
a
bit
offputting
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
one
not
up
to
the
standards
of
the
rest
of
the
ltd
series
probably
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
but
not
worth
hunting
down
at
all
this
taste
more
of
a
fall
beer
then
summer
frist
smell
frist
taste
is
crispy
a
smooth
beer
going
down
but
enjoy
this
beer
but
their
other
out
that
dont
remind
you
of
fall
roastly
dont
taste
it
i
mostly
drink
dark
beer
they
say
what
they
put
in
it
i
dont
taste
it
o
this
is
a
good
version
of
the
style
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
to
earn
higher
scores
but
a
good
flavorful
and
colorful
lager
o
a
very
complex
and
rich
tasting
vienna
lager
this
is
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
had
really
great
beer
o
a
very
flavorful
lager
with
the
flavor
of
malt
spicy
hops
and
hops
bitterness
all
balanced
overall
a
tasty
lager
but
not
one
that
really
stands
out
from
the
pack
really
reminded
me
of
sa
boston
lager
i
would
pick
it
up
again
if
i
saw
it
malty
up
front
im
getting
caramel
and
toasted
malts
mostly
slight
bitterness
along
with
earthyherbal
hops
crisp
finish
mediumlight
bodied
carbonation
is
nice
i
like
the
malt
profile
on
this
one
quite
a
bit
just
enough
sweetness
on
a
cocoa
hazelnut
caramel
flavor
kiss
of
leafy
hops
add
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
an
appropriate
carbonation
this
is
my
favorite
in
the
ltd
series
since
the
very
first
one
it
is
kind
of
somewhere
in
between
a
dunkel
and
an
amber
lager
i
wish
i
would
have
found
this
one
earlier
in
the
summer
i
wouldve
bought
it
on
more
than
one
occasion
thats
for
sure
i
expect
this
beer
to
be
light
and
crisp
but
this
beer
is
too
spritzy
and
lacks
smoothness
its
not
bad
per
se
and
the
smoothness
does
come
in
with
the
carbonation
after
the
bite
of
the
fizziness
backs
off
a
little
but
its
still
too
much
this
beer
strikes
me
as
muddled
and
uninteresting
its
kind
of
just
there
nothing
really
inspiring
or
sorry
to
say
interesting
going
on
here
its
a
beer
amber
lager
yeah
great
blah
blah
snoozer
o
this
was
an
okay
red
lager
nothing
too
exciting
but
it
is
very
sessionable
overall
the
aroma
promised
more
than
the
flavor
delivered
a
bit
cloyingly
sweet
and
lacking
hop
presence
in
the
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
grain
and
grass
with
not
too
much
else
going
on
the
flavor
is
similar
the
toffee
and
grain
notes
really
stand
out
with
some
grass
from
the
hops
thrown
in
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
this
beer
is
quite
malty
but
is
rather
easy
to
drink
tastetoasted
maltspiciness
caramel
smooth
flavorfull
and
sessionable
a
good
crossover
craft
brew
a
preprohibition
style
lager
that
would
go
great
with
a
couple
og
grilled
hot
dogs
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
fluted
glass
this
pours
a
dark
amberish
brown
with
a
short
lived
off
white
head
the
smells
are
of
light
crisp
malts
not
any
real
hop
presence
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
okay
not
real
strong
a
little
nutty
light
hops
didnt
convert
me
to
lagers
thats
for
sure
pours
a
cola
looking
brown
with
an
amber
hue
slight
brown
head
as
it
poured
but
by
the
time
i
put
the
cup
down
there
was
no
head
to
speak
of
a
very
sweet
sugar
candy
aroma
with
some
brown
sugar
and
a
hit
of
hay
that
i
associate
with
lager
flavor
starts
off
sweet
with
some
brown
sugar
and
candy
a
little
lager
yeast
comes
in
mid
stream
and
it
closes
out
with
the
sugary
sweetness
with
some
herbs
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
in
general
thinnish
to
medium
bodied
bodied
overall
meh
overall
decent
beer
not
really
digging
the
herbal
qualities
presented
here
drinkable
but
i
probably
wont
buy
again
pours
a
clear
dark
ambercopper
with
a
12
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
slight
caramel
and
an
interesting
earthy
herbal
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
probably
not
something
i
would
go
after
again
this
is
amber
lager
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
one
of
the
few
dark
beers
that
is
great
for
the
summer
time
very
refreshing
crisp
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
solid
brew
for
full
sail
one
of
there
better
ones
poured
into
a
becker
a
full
rich
deep
bronze
color
with
a
well
defined
sticky
12
finger
off
white
headwhat
great
color
and
clarity
alot
of
german
malty
goodness
in
the
nose
with
toasty
bread
and
a
bit
of
iron
to
go
with
sweetish
caramel
crisp
toasty
bread
on
the
palate
with
mild
caramel
sweetness
in
the
finisha
smattering
of
leafy
hops
as
well
this
is
a
great
amber
lagerto
me
it
has
a
little
marzen
in
it
with
crisp
bready
maltand
ironmineral
notes
a
great
lagerthis
should
be
much
higher
rated
in
my
humble
opinion
drinkability
the
wonderful
texture
of
this
ale
made
it
worth
drinking
mouthfeel
is
full
and
pleasant
overall
not
bad
at
all
a
soso
lager
offering
not
bad
but
really
wound
up
lacking
with
any
distinctive
malt
flavors
sure
id
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pass
it
up
for
a
more
flavorful
alternative
pours
a
nice
medium
redorange
amber
light
off
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
looks
nice
mild
slightly
sour
sweet
malt
and
wheat
aroma
hint
of
grain
light
spicy
hop
finish
light
bodied
and
very
subdued
flavor
light
malt
nuts
light
fruit
tastes
like
a
decent
lager
that
has
been
somewhat
watered
down
the
taste
that
is
there
is
pleasant
but
faded
might
do
in
a
pinch
drinkability
this
beer
is
definitely
repeatable
and
easily
drinkable
particularly
on
a
hot
day
it
reminds
me
somewhat
of
magic
hat
vinyl
it
provides
good
value
for
the
cost
and
id
probably
buy
it
again
but
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
after
it
warms
up
i
could
have
downed
a
couple
more
but
this
was
part
of
a
mixed
6pack
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
copper
color
that
had
some
amber
highlights
that
could
be
seen
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
offwhite
head
retained
itself
rather
well
and
it
left
bands
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
bready
malt
yeast
hints
of
nuts
and
some
greengrassy
hops
the
flavors
were
similar
with
the
sweet
malt
coming
first
followed
by
notes
of
bread
and
biscuits
as
well
as
yeast
and
then
at
the
end
the
pleasant
bitterness
of
floral
hops
as
it
warmed
up
i
detected
some
notes
of
citrus
in
the
hop
finish
as
well
but
they
were
still
delicate
enough
to
compliment
the
malt
elements
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
good
o
not
a
bad
redm
but
nothing
crazy
different
about
it
good
clean
red
with
a
good
abv
if
you
like
reds
you
will
like
this
one
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
the
taste
is
of
a
traditional
redlots
of
crystal
malt
flavors
without
much
sweetness
theres
enough
hop
to
give
some
balance
but
it
is
really
a
malt
brew
compared
to
most
ambers
id
say
the
body
is
on
the
thinner
side
this
isnt
the
best
amber
ive
had
and
because
it
tasted
and
felt
strong
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
its
a
good
effort
on
full
sails
behalf
but
its
just
a
bit
dark
and
not
hoppy
enough
to
fit
the
bill
by
itself
this
is
a
good
beer
to
kick
back
with
after
a
long
day
o
sacrilegious
to
say
this
perhaps
but
this
is
very
similar
to
and
certainly
no
better
than
killiians
red
a
good
lager
clear
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
a
three
finger
foamy
off
white
head
head
lasts
about
five
minutes
and
leaves
good
lacing
smell
is
grainy
malts
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malts
and
just
barely
enough
hops
easy
drinking
with
just
enough
carbonation
for
proper
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
spicy
leathery
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
medium
bitter
sweet
finish
overall
a
very
fine
amber
good
job
full
sail
overall
not
bad
at
all
it
seems
like
it
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
it
reminds
me
of
a
nice
mexican
vienna
lager
but
a
bit
drier
id
have
this
again
im
a
big
fan
of
full
sail
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
i
cant
say
that
i
really
love
amber
ales
so
the
entreaty
to
convert
to
lagerism
kind
of
falls
on
deaf
ears
however
with
the
solid
biscuitcracker
nature
of
a
good
lager
and
the
colour
and
bearing
of
a
standard
red
ale
this
is
indeed
a
decent
gateway
beer
for
the
rare
extant
craft
drinker
who
only
has
had
lager
up
to
this
point
overall
a
decent
warm
weathersession
brew
but
still
not
complex
enough
to
make
me
convert
to
lagerism
as
the
bottle
states
an
easy
drinker
but
nothing
special
here
overall
not
bad
nothing
special
the
lager
yeast
doesnt
play
as
well
with
the
toasted
caramel
malts
a
little
syrupy
and
seems
like
the
lager
yeast
was
rushed
a
bit
as
it
didnt
add
as
many
great
lager
flavors
as
usual
and
hints
of
an
off
flavor
also
where
are
the
hops
o
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
better
ltds
to
come
through
although
i
have
liked
most
of
them
pretty
well
this
amber
lager
really
slams
the
malt
aroma
and
flavor
and
provides
it
in
a
highly
creamy
drinkable
brew
the
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
dry
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
light
biscuit
malt
breadiness
the
taste
is
great
as
well
it
has
a
very
smooth
bready
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
dry
lager
yeast
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
amber
lager
its
complex
yet
highly
drinkable
overall
if
more
brewers
would
put
as
much
effort
into
their
amber
ales
and
lagers
as
full
sail
has
done
the
style
wouldnt
be
waning
quite
pleasant
certainly
worth
trying
o
a
decent
brew
nice
flavor
profile
id
definitely
drink
another
overall
its
pretty
decent
but
not
outstanding
id
probably
try
it
on
tap
if
i
saw
it
somewhere
but
i
doubt
ill
buy
a
sixpack
again
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixpack
its
ok
i
dont
really
like
it
that
much
but
my
other
beer
isnt
cold
yet
so
its
better
than
no
beer
at
all
it
smells
clean
and
the
lightly
bitter
finish
is
refreshing
but
theres
something
in
the
malt
profile
i
dont
like
and
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
i
suppose
it
goes
down
just
fine
as
long
as
im
not
thinking
about
it
d
pretty
mild
slighy
malty
after
taste
pours
amber
with
a
finger
of
resilient
offwhite
head
sweet
malt
a
little
red
hot
candy
and
some
apples
to
the
nose
sweet
and
a
bit
grainy
to
the
tongue
with
a
slight
hop
edge
at
the
end
light
to
medium
bodied
well
balanced
and
smooth
going
down
great
summertime
brew
right
here
from
a
series
that
always
satisfies
this
full
sail
fan
oa
good
brew
nothing
great
but
nothing
bad
or
overpowering
as
well
pretty
good
id
drink
again
but
not
seek
out
overall
ill
be
honest
its
a
skosh
reminiscent
of
magic
hats
vinyl
which
is
certainly
fine
as
i
enjoyed
that
one
as
well
a
mighty
tasty
malty
red
lager
i
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
just
the
other
day
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
good
sized
white
head
slightly
metallic
aroma
along
with
sweet
malt
and
some
hops
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkable
with
flavors
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
hops
aroma
is
not
strong
but
still
malty
and
slightly
fruity
just
a
little
appealing
it
pours
a
dark
brownish
amber
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
flavor
is
malty
with
a
fruity
undertone
mainly
pear
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
texture
is
fairly
smooth
just
a
little
fizzy
im
not
a
big
fan
of
lagers
but
this
is
pretty
good
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
quaffable
beer
a
solid
session
offering
12oz
bottle
pours
clear
amber
with
offwhtie
head
moderate
carbonation
aroma
has
florals
sweet
caramel
and
fresh
cut
grass
taste
is
sweet
with
more
caramel
malts
and
some
light
bittering
hops
medium
bodied
with
a
slickoily
texture
finish
is
smooth
and
slightly
bitter
a
pretty
good
beer
although
its
a
little
maltier
than
i
prefer
still
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
nice
job
d
decent
drinkability
one
or
two
but
doesnt
come
off
as
session
style
or
one
that
defines
a
style
overall
a
limited
beer
that
is
limited
in
spectrum
and
comes
off
a
bit
ordinary
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
light
carbonation
a
watery
feel
and
a
very
light
body
decent
beer
boring
overall
but
still
only
decent
at
best
o
a
little
sweet
for
my
personal
taste
but
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
the
third
of
the
ltds
i
have
had
and
believe
they
offer
high
quaility
for
value
pretty
flavorful
red
lager
this
holds
its
own
in
the
style
good
malt
presence
this
is
a
keeper
overall
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
it
must
have
been
a
boring
accident
because
this
beer
is
not
exciting
nor
would
i
session
it
t
lagers
of
any
kind
arent
really
my
thing
but
this
one
isnt
terrible
probably
my
favorite
of
the
three
ltds
ive
tried
the
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
with
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
something
that
almost
tastes
like
cotton
candy
the
finish
has
some
grassy
and
slightly
metallic
tasting
hops
and
a
bit
of
bready
malt
o
good
flavor
good
balance
sessionable
beer
for
sure
i
always
find
full
sail
to
be
a
good
value
even
if
they
arent
the
best
in
their
style
i
think
ive
probably
had
three
sixers
if
this
already
since
its
only
6
amber
in
colo
of
course
with
a
smell
like
lager
sort
of
earthy
too
taste
is
decent
a
little
bready
and
easily
distinguished
as
a
full
sail
beer
maybe
its
the
malt
overall
an
easy
sipper
and
a
good
value
drinkable
i
guess
if
you
like
the
style
i
am
more
of
an
ale
drinker
and
this
one
wont
get
me
to
switch

this
is

amber
lager
nice
job
fs
while
not
my
top
favorite
of
the
ltd
series
i
have
liked
them
all
i
wonder
why
full
sail
doesnt
jettison
their
regular
and
not
very
interesting
beers
and
make
these
the
lineup
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
im
going
to
miss
overall
a
nice
beer
incredibly
drinkable
great
smell
and
pretty
decent
taste
overall
not
much
to
look
at
but
is
fairly
well
done
doesnt
have
a
large
amount
of
hops
but
i
still
find
it
to
be
good
overall
i
like
it
very
different
from
any
other
beers
ive
had
reminds
me
of
a
cloudy
hefewizen
but
slightly
citrusy
i
have
a
female
relative
who
is
very
picky
about
what
beers
she
likes
and
i
think
shed
like
this
very
much
giving
it
a
thumbs
up
good
job
full
sail
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
impressive
offering
from
the
ltd
series
and
my
favorite
one
in
a
few
years
i
can
easily
see
picking
up
a
sixer
of
this
one
again
pleasant
amber
flavors
on
the
initial
sip
imply
that
the
subtle
aromas
are
minor
distractions
light
caramel
and
some
hop
spice
are
evident
yet
without
the
fuller
body
of
an
ale
as
implied
finishes
with
a
bit
of
light
chocolate
and
dry
hazelnut
still
relatively
full
in
body
for
an
amber
lager
and
with
a
firm
and
dry
spicy
finish
stands
up
to
warming
fairly
well
given
its
relatively
coarse
structure
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
im
really
liking
this
lager
great
value
and
quality
easy
drinking
but
rich
with
all
the
fantastic
bold
ales
coming
out
of
the
us
its
nice
to
see
that
these
guys
can
still
put
together
an
impressive
lager
this
is
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
have
tried
in
a
while
and
i
think
ill
be

the
pour
is
a
deep
and
clean
amber
tone
with
orange
hues
a
quick
fizzy
head
emerges
then
disappears
the
aroma
is
vibrant
with
rich
toasted
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
a
yeasty
chaser
the
body
runs
in
the
medium
range
i
very
much
enjoyed
its
sweet
malty
taste
which
seemed
to
capture
what
i
like
best
about
amber
ales
easy
to
drink
overall
i
loved
it
this
is
my
second
time
trying
the
ltd
series
i
tried
4
which
i
also
like
this
one
is
a
little
different
from
4
this
is
a
lager
with
sort
of
an
ale
personality
you
still
get
the
lager
body
and
taste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
have
my
fair
share
until
they
stop
making
this
easy
drinking
not
complex
but
still
tasty
that
wins
with
me
pours
an
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
in
off
white
head
retention
is
not
great
smell
has
a
malty
sweetness
to
it
sort
of
bready
there
is
also
some
hoppiness
in
the
nose
but
the
sweet
malts
stand
out
more
the
taste
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
it
was
certainly
not
bad
the
taste
gives
you
more
of
that
easygoing
maltiness
i
am
getting
bread
grains
maybe
a
little
caramel
the
gps
are
less
pronounced
in
the
taste
but
the
different
malts
give
some
complexity
that
makes
up
for
it
some
mouthfeel
was
on
par
for
this
style
but
might
have
lacked
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
overall
a
great
addition
to
the
ltd
line
from
full
sail
i
got
on
the
ltd
train
a
little
late
and
i
am
regretting
it
now
they
are
making
some
really
cool
german
style
lagers
overall
a
damn
fine
lager
like
all
of
full
sails
nice
to
see
them
experimenting
w
so
many
lagers
so
far
my
order
of
favorite
ltds
is
as
follows
0304050201
i
had
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
last
week
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
good
beer
either
it
smelled
mostly
of
sweet
malts
and
grain
i
felt
the
mouth
and
taste
was
rather
watery
and
bland
and
it
reminded
me
more
of
an
amber
ale
with
no
hop
bite
i
know
they
were
going
for
a
larger
that
amber
ale
drinkers
would
like
but
i
feel
they
missed
the
fulled
body
malt
flavor
that
lagers
a
supposed
to
have
and
then
forgot
to
add
the
hops
for
that
little
bite
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
only
picked
up
one
bottle
in
a
mixed
six
pack
at
safeway
in
bend

wondrous
drinkable
session
beer
brilliant
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
with
enough
flavor
aroma
that
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
during
a
single
afternoon
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
a
good
beer
just
not
a
real
good
one
and
certainly
not
a
session
beer
despite
the
product
line
this
is
a
pretty
heavy
feeling
lager
and
weighs
a
bit
more
than
your
average
amber

abv
the
booze
is
detectable
but
actually
pleasant
good
tasting
but
could
use
more
carbonation
and
a
heavier
hopping
hand
for
more
balance
and
bite
needs
a
body
tweak
for
improved
crispness
cmon
full
sail
i
know
you
could
do
this
better
first
time
having
anything
by
full
sail
but
what
caught
my
eye
was
the
red
lager
on
the
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
almost
no
head
despite
being
fairly
carbonated
a
dark
amber
youd
expect
from
an
ale
smelled
sweet
first
pull
was
different
and
not
off
putting
enjoyed
the
carbonation
and
the
body
which
was
a
little
distracted
by
the
tingling
of
the
carb
almost
a
light
brown
sugar
after
taste
and
almost
no
hop
notes
at
all
considering
the
high
abv
for
a
brew
lager
this
is
pretty
great
sorry
for
the
lack
of
descriptive
language
lost
my
sense
if
smell
due
to
being
sick
just
now
slowly
getting
it
back
will
get
again
once
full
senses
come
back
olfactory
would
recommend
if
your
wanting
something
different
to
enjoy
no
risks
here
first
beer
i
can
remember
in
the
now
popular
session
ipa
mold
fest
does
a
great
job
of
keeping
a
great
flavor
on
a
thin
bodied
highly
drinkable
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
dark
amber
with
a
soupy
head
smell
is
floral
taste
is
a
non
bitter
hoppyness
with
notes
of
butterscotch
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
buttery
overall
i
great
drinker
and
one
to
look
forward
to
in
the
winter
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
have
no
problem
knocking
back
of
few
of
these
in
succession
o
nice
red
lager
full
of
flavor
o
a
dark
lager
or
middark
czech
style
very
original
very
good
very
good
food
beer
must
try
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
make
it
a
regular
or
a
well
a
session
i
think
its
a
winter
seasonal
o
at

abv
this
is
not
a
session
beer
in
the
british
sense
of
the
word
but
true
to
the
session
brand
it
is
very
quaffable
no
flaws
and
no
frills
this
is
just
an
easy
lager
to
put
down
and
a
fun
beer
to
drink
overall
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
too
metallic
and
forgettable
pass
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
favorite
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
red
lager
but
it
reminds
me
of
a
marzen
good
pleasant
beer
that
if
offered
i
would
accept
not
something
i
would
aggressively
seek
out
but
a
worthy
choice
this
is
really
really
nice
easily
the
best
lager
ive
had
from
the
western
united
states
its
like
an
oktoberfestlight
the
smooth
malt
and
medium
bitterness
are
balanced
wonderfully
not
as
well
as
a
wisconsin
lager
but
this
is
not
to
discredit
this
brew
with
a
slight
spiciness
to
it
session
beers
provide
a
tasty
highly
sessionable
beer
with
a
fairly
low
price
point
of
course
their
bottles
are
only
11oz
so
youre
not
getting
any
particular
bargain
over
a
pack
of
sam
adams
or
sierra
nevada
but
their
lagers
provice
a
more
basic
taste
tailored
for
sessions
our
local
store
had
12
packs
of
these
marked
down
to
6
cant
help
but
pick
one
up
this
one
is
a
little
more
robust
than
the
classic
or
black
lagers
hops
carbonation
have
quite
a
bite
its
a
good
if
unremarkable
taste
to
me
its
not
quite
as
sessionable
as
the
others
but
its
worth
a
shot
especially
if
you
get
it
at
the
price
i
did
itll
go
well
with
a
lot
of
food
too
overall
a
tasty
amber
lager
and
one
that
as
the
name
would
suggest
is
quite
sessionable
one
to
pick
up
if
you
see
it
around
a
well
done
red
lager
enjoyable
flavor
profile
and
easy
drinking
medium
to
full
body
very
nice
only
complaint
is
the
bottle
of
11
ounces
hugely
drinkable
rich
lager
a
cut
way
above
so
many
over
hopped
reds
and
overstrong
winter
brews
i
am
never
disappointed
by
the
numerous
brews
in
the
lager
style
that
full
sail
is
making
from
the
11
oz
bottle
bought
at
the
utah
liquor
store
in
sugar
house
an
excellent
red
lager
overall
nothing
to
extraordinary
here
the
bottle
is
fun
but
is
missing
an
ounce
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
lagers
but
this
is
pretty
good
a
tad
sweet
for
me
but
not
cloying
all
in
all
it
is
a
good
beer
i
enjoy
red
ales
and
this
stands
pretty
well
as
a
red
lager
in
my
book
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
very
nice
understated
beerwhich
surprised
me
by
its
lack
of
spices
alcohol
or
other
typical
christmasbeer
elements
smooth
super
high
quality
and
i
would
bet
just
what
czech
polotmavé
lightdark
beer
is
supposed
to
bewonderful
quality
beer
to
share
with
friends
any
beer
drinker
can
enjoy
thisthough
hopheads
will
be
discontent
that
it
doesnt
slap
them
in
the
throatoh
well
let
them
settle
down
as
i
wrote
above
thoughterrific
that
americas
most
serious
brewers
are
finally
paying
attention
to
do
first
quality
renditions
of
the
continents
most
serious
beers
instead
of
just
following
english
or
20something
american
tastes
sweet
malts
up
front
toasted
nuts
caramel
bright
fruit
herbal
hop
finish
body
is
medium
crisp
slight
dry
aftertaste
well
carbonated
i
like
sessions
dark
as
much
as
this
full
sail
did
a
great
job
in
this
years
batch
i
would
reccomend
this
the
body
was
smooth
and
even
but
a
slightly
sticky
finish
was
a
bit
offputting
drinkability
was
very
nice
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
overall
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
sessions
brews
although
i
do
like
the
black
fairly
well
a
nice
brew
thats
worth
a
shot
when
you
see
it
this
is
a
fairly
good
amber
ale
the
carbonation
seems
a
bit
too
high
in
my
opinion
kind
of
too
frothy
in
the
mouth
but
the
flavor
tone
is
nice
enough
seems
to
be
some
spices
on
there
maybe
its
just
the
mix
of
malts
and
hops
but
its
too
muddled
for
me
to
be
able
to
pick
something
out
precisely
either
way
a
pleasant
enough
ale
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
earthy
hop
notes
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
hazelnut
followed
by
grassy
spilt
hops
theres
also
a
lactic
diaceytl
presence
which
is
offputting
and
slightly
sour
just
really
odd
tasting
overall
a
nice
addition
to
the
session
lineup
not
as
dramatic
as
the
session
black
but
still
pleasant
great
deal
when
a
12pack
was
8bucks
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
once
you
get
to
the
taste
but
it
seems
to
evade
one
a
bit
o
i
enjoyed
this
once
again
full
sail
does
a
good
job
of
giving
you
session
beers
that
are
drinkable
but
not
boring
o
very
drinkable
malty
good
feel
and
balance
not
sure
yet
if
ill
repeat
this
next
holiday
season
the
other
session
brethren
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
in
my
opinion
but
this
one
fell
a
little
short
of
the
high
standard
set
strong
crisp
aroma
is
mainly
malty
and
has
quite
a
bite
to
it
i
got
a
mild
skunky
whiff
but
that
hardly
put
me
off
it
pours
a
nice
clear
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
thick
and
fluffy
pale
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
flavor
is
fairly
typical
for
a
lager
except
fairly
strong
and
with
nary
a
trace
of
the
skunkiness
i
detected
in
the
aroma
maybe
i
was
smelling
things
it
does
have
a
hoppy
somewhat
bitter
tone
with
a
hint
of
something
nasty
but
it
is
still
decidedly
drinkable
texture
has
average
body
and
average
fizziness
overall
not
great
but
worth
a
try
maybe
this
sample
was
from
not
their
best
batch
ive
had
this
stubby
bottle
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
and
i
have
been
meaning
to
drink
since
xmas
2011
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
amber
body
not
much
head
and
no
lacing
not
very
impressive
to
look
at
smell
had
faint
hints
of
holiday
spices
taste
was
only
slightly
above
average
some
orange
peel
ginger
toasted
malt
and
cherry
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
and
slightly
bitter
at
the
end
the
abv
of
over
6
was
not
really
noticeable
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
session
beer
as
i
wouldnt
see
myself
drinking
multiple
bottles
of
this
o
very
drinkable
brew
with
pretty
good
abv
with
looking
for
and
a
like
the
bottle
says
session
fest
overall
i
didnt
really
care
for
it
some
off
notes
and
i
dont
care
for
toasted
ambers
like
fat
tire
presentation
packaged
in
a
stubby
elevenounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
overall
impression
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
no
shortage
of
pleasant
subtleties
otherwise
this
gets
the
proverbial
job
done
if
youre
looking
to
put
a
few
back
maybe
tie
one
on
with
decent
craft
beer
thisll
certainly
suffice
its
not
packed
with
a
lot
of
flavor
or
a
complex
bouquet
but
as
i
said
itll
do
the
job
its
been
tasked
to
do
medium
bodied
with
above
medium
semisharp
carbonation
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
will
probably
drink
faster
than
you
should
given
the
6
2
abv
but
hey
its
the
holidays
overall
another
good
offering
from
session
overall
remarkably
drinkable
overall
this
is
another
beer
from
full
sail
that
i
have
enjoyed
in
the
past
week
will
have
to
upgrade
my
selection
and
try
some
of
their
other
stuff
in
the
near
future
i
can
see
knocking
back
a
few
over
a
period
of
time
another
fine
addition
to
full
sails
session
beer
family
o
hmm
well
there
aint
much
to
this
brew
its
an
affordablesessionable
lager
that
would
probably
go
great
with
some
pulled
pork
sandwiches
i
liked
the
flavor
profile
and
it
smelled
clean
and
inviting
to
me
overall
though
i
thought
this
beer
was
just
alright
id
probably
buy
it
again
because
it
tastes
good
and
its
on
the
cheaper
side
light
but
not
too
light
lowmedium
carbonation
an
alright
beer
at
best
poured
from
the
session
pillbottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
an
almost
crystalclear
browncopper
coloring
with
a
slow
steady
flow
of
bubbling
and
a
filmy
coating
of
head
aromas
are
rich
and
malty
with
a
sweet
caramel
tang
to
the
normal
roasted
cereal
scents
of
a
lager
flavors
are
nutty
and
spicy
with
a
caramel
backbone
and
a
slight
hopping
at
the
end
to
clean
everything
from
the
palate
tasty
brew
on
a
round
smooth
yet
crisp
body
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
resiny
and
bitter
with
a
roasted
character
the
finish
dries
nicely
leaving
the
palate
clear
for
more
very
easy
brew
to
drink
and
the
flavors
are
spiced
and
smooth
enough
to
make
a
very
sessionable
holiday
ale
this
pours
a
burnt
sienna
color
malty
molasses
aromas
lightly
hopped
light
bitter
but
not
really
all
that
enjoyable
thin
finish
the
malt
profile
is
out
of
alignment
it
doesnt
hold
up
to
warmingthe
spicesflavoring
goes
out
of
balance
and
comes
off
harshly
at
least
the
stubby
bottle
is
cute
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
chunky
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
maltgrains
breadbiscuit
and
some
caramel
notes
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
bread
caramel
and
some
spicy
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
red
lager
and
a
good
alternative
to
spiced
winter
beers
this
is
probably
my
favorite
session
beer
from
full
sail
to
date
dark
copperred
nearly
a
tawny
brown
thin
shortlasting
bubbles
show
head
retention
just
a
tad
more
impressive
than
a
soft
drink
polotmavé
never
had
nor
heard
of
the
style
im
guessing
amber
lager
is
a
good
enough
descriptor
some
caramel
baking
bread
and
shortbread
balance
out
a
pleasant
grassy
and
earthy
hoppiness
nicely
brewed
and
clean
dryness
is
appreciated
since
this
was
meant
to
be
an
easy
drinker
surprisingly
full
sail
managed
to
capture
some
holiday
elements
in
this
seemingly
basic
red
lager
its
nice
to
see
a
brewery
go
outside
of
the
winter
warmerstout
box
for
a
winter
seasonal
this
definitely
a
beer
that
would
please
both
craft
drinkers
and
generic
beer
guzzlers
alike
i
think
a
box
of
12
bottles
will
be
making
the
trip
to
thanksgiving
dinner
with
me
this
year
dark
copperamber
not
much
for
head
but
a
good
amount
of
foam
clings
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
every
time
i
sip
some
more
forms
on
the
sides
light
german
malty
sweetness
some
hop
spice
as
well
biscuity
malt
flavor
and
just
like
the
nose
it
finishes
with
some
hoppy
spice
thinner
side
of
a
body
but
still
a
decent
malt
character
of
the
three
session
beers
this
is
my
least
favorite
it
has
a
certain
generic
quality
to
it
that
left
me
a
bit
flat
however
it
is
a
decent
beer
its
just
not
for
me
seriously
all
i
want
is
to
see
the
cowboys
lose
i
dont
care
to
who
is
that
too
much
to
ask
this
is
just
like
the
other
fs
session
beers
nothing
spectacular
just
clean
good
drinking
beers
and
at
a
great
price
too
solid
beer
not
much
to
look
at
with
its
pale
amberness
and
lackofoamyhead
smells
like
malt
liquor
with
a
spicy
cinnamon
poke
in
the
sniffer
smells
like
flowers
too
tastes
tingly
and
bocklike
surely
a
dichotomy
mouth
feel
belies
the
light
color
a
bit
weightier
than
expected
but
by
no
means
a
tongue
carpet
i
picked
up
a
single
in
this
instance
but
ill
get
the
12er
next
time
appearance
is
a
dark
copper
amber
having
a
stable
head
and
nice
lace
smell
is
light
thats
a
little
grainy
roasted
malt
and
hops
taste
of
grainy
roasted
malt
with
a
bitter
hop
lasting
through
the
aftertaste
cant
taste
much
of
the
alchohol
either
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
spike
of
carbonation
no
wow
factor
hear
but
not
to
bad
for
a
red
bravo
full
sail
the
appearance
turned
out
to
be
pretty
good
the
lacing
was
pretty
patchy
but
it
followed
me
pretty
much
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
body
was
kinda
ugly
but
that
was
only
because
of
the
colors
the
head
was
eh
not
great
im
kinda
confused
on
how
to
grade
this
beer
for
appearance
maybe
it
deserves
a
4
for
the
good
lacing
but
im
pretty
sure
its
well
short
due
to
everything
else
overall
not
a
bad
easy
drinking
beer
flavors
dont
exactly
wow
you
with
anything
but
its
still
got
enough
going
on
to
keep
things
interesting
i
feel
like
this
is
what
fat
tire
could
be
if
it
were
a
lager
and
a
bit
more
robust
its
a
well
made
beer
and
i
like
it
i
just
wish
you
really
could
call
it
a
session
lager
recommended
tasty
and
straight
forward
offering
more
dark
bread
notes
malty
sweetness
a
pinch
of
all
spice
a
rye
note
and
light
dryness
in
the
finish
ehh
decent
litle
sessioner
but
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
o
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
yet
another
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
lager
from
full
sail
a
pretty
kick
ass
edition
to
the
session
lineup
i
was
a
fan
to
begin
with
but
to
have
an
option
even
if
it
is
seasonal
is
great
bring
on
the
lagers
overall
impression
another
drinkable
offering
in
the
session
line
this
is
not
the
most
exciting
beer
out
there
but
its
a
solid
amber
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
o
a
pretty
good
amber
nothing
too
complex
paired
well
with
a
almond
butter
sandwich
m
slight
carbonation
enjoyable
to
drink
clean
and
smooth
just
as
a
lager
should
be
thanks
to
elrogish
quinn
for
breaking
these
bad
boys
out
during
our
cabin
barleywine
trip
solid
beer
overall
a
very
nice
and
balanced
beer
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
id
expect
a
good
solid
beer
from
full
sail
and
they
delivered
overall
now
thats
a
beer
ive
not
had
in
a
long
time
a
long
time
maybe
its
just
me
but
this
one
reminds
me
of
the
first
installment
to
the
ltd
series
the
flavour
was
great
slightly
hoppy
and
nutty
a
really
unique
characteristic
the
higher
than
normal
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
enjoyable
this
is
probably
up
there
as
one
of
my
favorite
fest
beers
and
i
would
buy
this
again
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
smell
is
mostly
malt
with
some
yeast
and
subtle
spice
notes
the
taste
starts
with
the
malt
and
moves
into
the
yeast
and
has
a
nice
subtle
spice
finish
the
aftertaste
has
some
of
the
malty
notes
with
a
subtle
sweetness
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
adds
the
the
depth
of
the
beer
giving
a
thicker
style
nice
carbonation
and
an
easy
drinker
these
session
beers
are
solid
beers
all
with
subtle
nuances
and
great
flavor
nothing
huge
and
over
the
top
but
done

ok
on
the

has
a
rather
evident
alcohol
graininess
right
at
the
end
but
its
not
that
bad
nice
beer
at
a
good
price
another
fine
session
offering
not
bad
i
have
only
had
a
couple
so
i
might
change
my
tune
but
this
winter
could
be
one
of
cases
of
celebration
and
12s
of
this
great
beer
overall
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
i
think
its
a
great
beer
to
have
at
parties
i
love
the
bottles
and
theyre
so
easy
to
put
in
the
coolers
to
lug
around
this
sessions
is
awesome
totally
dig
it
nice
mix
of
a
german
strong
lager
and
a
dry
irish
red
ale
this
is
new
interesting
affordable
and
best
of
all
tastes
really
good
well
done
id
say
thanks
full
sail
im
starting
to
like
your
session
series
more
than
your
regular
one

a
nice
lager
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
other
full
sail
sessions
and
this
one
is
enjoyable
though
i
think
i
like
the
other
better
still
no
worries
with
putting
these
back
a
very
nice
everyday
drinker
its
a
solid
drinker
a
sessionable
beer
perhaps
for
the
cool
holidays
yes
but
i
can
see
this
recipe
as
more
of
a
marketing
ploy
if
it
were
bottled
in
6packs
and
sold
for
more
i
doubt
it
would
do
as
well
as
it
is
as
a
new
session
series
the
flavor
is
very
good
but
the
rest
falls
short
i
am
more
keen
to
the
likes
of
their
latest
imperial
ipa
because
that
beer
didnt
taste
like
the
rest
of
theirs
this
one
does
would
drink
again
in
fact
ive
had
several
already
but
only
won
once
at
paper
rock
scissors
i
always
look
for
local
brews
when
i
travel
the
store
down
the
road
only
had
mojave
red
and
i
can
honestly
say
i
really
enjoy
it
im
not
always
a
lager
drinker
but
its
smooth
and
balanced
i
will
definitely
keep
this
in
mind
for
the
next
time
i
am
out
in
the
mojave
area
overall
nothing
special
but
not
bad
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
or
buy
from
a
store
o
if
you
find
most
red
ales
too
strong
then
you
may
like
this
beer
otherwise
it
is
a
lackluster
brew
that
feels
like
its
holding
back
i
really
want
to
like
this
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
of
the
primary
characteristic
i
requiretaste
not
recommended
if
you
want
to
make
a
red
ale
without
hops
fine
make
it
smooth
but
why
make
a
red
ale
that
is
nasty
bitter
without
hops
it
just
doesnt
taste
good
a
little
heavy
on
the
caramel
malts
for
me
tried
this
a
couple
times
each
straight
from
the
bottle
dark
copper
color
with
a
bit
of
a
dusty
fruit
smell
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
some
hop
on
the
back
having
driven
by
indian
wells
i
was
pretty
excited
to
try
some
of
their
beers
but
this
along
with
the
gold
disappointed
the
red
amber
color
wanted
to
strive
for
a
nice
full
body
beer
but
this
one
fell
short
and
was
quite
watery
and
thin
out
in
the
desert
guess
it
good
to
have
something
cold
to
drink
but
i
would
pass
on
this
one
if
given
another
option
taste
is
candied
bitter
orange
peel
juicy
spice
light
toasted
grain
all
thin
and
a
bit
watery
finishes
watery
overly
sweet
with
brew
salts
left
over
not
high
on
my
list
but
here
in
mexico
i
take
my
american
microbrews
where
i
can
get
them
my
beer
rating
2
3
t
it
is
very
crispi
on
tongue
there
is
nice
sweetness
form
the
malt
nnice
bitterness
at
the
end
the
final
is
kind
of
short
the
hops
presence
is
good
enough
overall
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
and
i
wont
be
seeking
out
other
indian
wells
efforts
beer
was
served
on
tap
in
a
pilsner
glass
from
the
brewery
the
beer
has
a
good
red
coloring
to
it
with
a
light
head
the
smell
was
typical
of
most
reds
with
a
light
malty
tone
to
it
it
smelled
similar
to
most
reds
the
initial
taste
of
the
beer
is
good
but
unfortunately
the
flavor
is
off
your
tongue
before
you
swallow
it
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
and
easy
on
the
finish
almost
a
hint
of
apples
in
the
aftertaste
it
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
sit
back
and
drink
for
a
day
but
i
can
honestly
think
of
better
ways
to
spend
your
time
i
finished
about
half
the
bottle
and
then
shared
the
rest
with
the
drain
d
not
a
well
made
beer
a
definite
pass
on
this
effort
for
me
sample
at
alans
hsc
initation
bottle
from
park
lane
liquor
in
lancaster
ca
this
beer
is
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
quickly
spotty
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
malt
and
caramel
light
body
with
a
sweet
malt
character
and
light
caramel
and
hops
flavor
the
finish
is
sweet
toasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
aftertaste
pretty
basic
overall
d
decent
this
is
pretty
unexciting
but
not
too
bad
beats
their
pumpkin
ale
which
i
had
sidebyside
with
this
md
this
beer
was
a
bit
overcarbonated
just
too
fizzy
drinkability
was
okay
although
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
and
sticky
for
the
style
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
that
you
may
want
to
change
styles
from
after
two
or
three
of
these
new
beer
in
texas
so
had
to
try
poured
into
a
12oz
mug
its
a
dark
red
color
with
a
head
that
forms
well
but
falls
away
within
moments
the
nose
is
very
sweet
malt
flavor
is
malty
quite
sweet
a
touch
of
hops
wow
this
tastes
nearly
exactly
like
a
lot
of
kit
homebrews
made
with
hopped
malt
extract
it
makes
a
bit
nostalgic
for
my
first
few
brewing
attempts
im
not
sure
if
ive
ever
had
a
commercial
beer
that
tasted
as
much
like
cheap
homebrew
before
12
oz
bottle
from
some
general
store
in
death
valley
pours
a
translucent
amberbrown
color
with
a
fair
size
sudsy
beige
head
that
had
ok
retention
the
aroma
is
mostly
lightly
roasted
malts
with
corn
and
a
touch
of
fruit
the
taste
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
sweet
malts
corn
and
faint
walnut
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
the
palate
and
there
is
plenty
of
lively
carbonation
the
finish
is
short
and
slightly
biter
a
decent
quaff
that
is
much
more
interesting
than
the
macros
but
it
wont
hold
up
to
the
higher
craft
standards
d
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
from
indian
wells
probably
one
of
their
better
brews
at
that
found
for
a
decent
price
in
southern
california
if
offered
id
drink
one
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
of
this
type
i
managed
to
score
a
single
bottle
of
this
instead
of
having
to
purchase
a
six
pack
and
was
happy
for
that
not
a
beer
ill
be
revisiting
skip
this
one
kids
d
it
is
by
no
means
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
but
i
can
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
while
watching
a
movie
or
a
football
game
but
id
tend
to
reach
for
something
a
little
more
robust
to
sit
and
enjoy
as
an
overall
beer
dark
ruby
red
with
a
very
satisfying
head
nose
is
malt
malt
malt
and
a
touch
of
sour
fruit
taste
is
functional
but
unimaginative
conststing
primarily
of
caramel
with
a
dash
of
hops
and
an
unfortunate
bit
of
cloying
metallicism
band
name
mouthfeel
is
predictably
rich
but
sticky
and
unispiring
drinkability
is
fair
probably
wont
pick
it
up
again
but
wouldnt
make
it
a
point
not
to
either
drinkability
well
im
ready
to
pour
the
rest
out
no
wonder
they
were
blowing
this
out
at
whole
foods
interesting
lager
to
say
the
least
flavors
are
really
reminiscent
of
a
swartzbeir
drinkability
its
okay
nothing
great
im
getting
a
weird
aftertaste
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
but
i
wouldnt
steer
people
away
from
it
either
ill
never
buy
another
sixer
tho
i
havent
had
much
success
with
random
finds
at
trader
joes
im
starting
to
wonder
who
the
bigshot
is
that
samples
the
brew
before
they
sign
them
up
for
distribution
at
any
event
this
beer
is
not
reccomended
with
a
bullet
drinkability
no
thanks
is
all
i
have
to
say
hrmmm
no
sir
i
didnt
like
it
d
possibly
a
little
sweet
here
any
beer
competing
with
sabl
has
to
do
better
but
i
would
not
avoid
this
beer
however
nb
i
just
checked
out
the
website
quote
mojave
red
is
flash
pasturized
to
guarantee
a
fresh
tasting
brew
every
time
wtf
is
this
the
micro
brewers
answer
to
bud
and
i
note
that
they
also
brew
an
irish
green
ale
for
st
patricks
day
oh
dear
as
lt
columbo
once
said
i
think
that
closes
the
case
nicely
they
cant
even
spell
pasteurize
properly
on
their
website
geez
guess
the
schools
are
poorly
attended
in
inyokern
nuff
said
if
this
beer
is
taken
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
this
lager
poured
a
nice
red
amber
head
shrunk
down
to
nothing
and
lacing
was
not
even
there
still
the
color
alone
bumps
up
the
appearance
a
bit
sweet
malty
bready
aroma
ultra
smooth
malty
refreshing
taste
profile
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
and
that
is
to
be
expected
of
a
beer
from
this
style
very
drinkable
and
nice
when
in
a
lager
mood
good
for
a
hot
day
or
with
lunch
a
decent
micro
lager
an
easy
drinking
brew
not
terribly
complex
but
a
solid
ale
i
would
buy
again
pours
a
dark
red
amber
with
a
fluffy
cloudlike
thick
1
finger
head
the
aroma
is
neither
unpleasant
or
strong
its
just
sorta
there
the
primary
smells
seem
to
be
nutty
or
maybe
yeasty
tastes
fairly
good
a
bit
bready
or
yeasty
a
little
sweet
and
rather
mild
feels
fairly
smooth
and
the
carbonation
and
maybe
some
of
the
sweetness
tingle
the
tongue
a
bit
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
id
really
look
for
again
overall
the
best
of
the
three
indian
wells
beers
i
sampled
i
tried
this
beer
about
five
years
ago
and
i
remember
liking
it
then
i
still
like
it
now
and
it
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
im
just
not
ready
for
the
nearly
two
hour
drive
to
get
it
did
not
think
much
of
this
beer
not
sure
if
it
was
a
bad
bottle
or
just
a
bad
beer
but
here
goes
deep
red
color
medium
head
roasted
malts
kind
of
spicy
no
hoppyness
flavor
a
little
weak
a
watered
down
red
ale
finish
is
neutral
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
nothing
spectacular
but
pretty
decent
an
okay
amber
lager
that
lacks
any
distinctive
qualities
the
flavor
is
a
let
down
lacking
some
of
the
malt
depth
suggested
by
the
aroma
worth
exploring
but
im
moving
on
o
overall
the
flavor
malt
and
hop
character
doesnt
show
me
enough
to
make
this
a
revist
or
worthy
of
a
recommendation
some
sour
flowery
off
taste
and
stale
malt
leaves
much
to
be
desired
and
not
enought
to
keep
you
drinking
after
one
othis
is
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
beer
the
smell
and
flavor
are
on
the
lighter
side
of
things
which
isnt
surprising
given
the
low
abv
and
the
style
in
general
there
are
more
intriguing
session
beers
out
there
but
this
one
drinks
pretty
easy
and
doesnt
offend
a
very
light
brew
for
a
beer
so
close
to
the
four
percent
mark
it
provides
a
pleasant
quaff
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
wilburs
total
beverage
in
fort
collins
pours
out
to
a
limp
head
but
with
decent
lacing
weirdly
enough
color
on
the
light
side
of
style
aroma
is
caramel
malt
yeast
and
faint
hops
flavor
is
doughy
biscuity
buttery
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
cheesy
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
crunchy
and
co2
is
ok
overall
kind
of
weird
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
of
course
this
sample
may
be
past
its
prime
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
retention
is
good
definitely
has
staying
power
smells
like
yeast
and
bread
with
a
mild
tea
like
hop
aroma
in
the
flavor
mild
earthy
hop
a
bit
of
lemon
and
crackery
malt
notes
kind
of
like
an
english
pale
ale
but
a
lager
as
there
is
a
bit
of
toffee
behind
the
stewed
hop
flavor
just
a
hint
of
butterscotch
bitterness
is
mild
but
with
good
balance
medium
bodied
with
a
yeast
slickness
overall
decent
brew
not
really
amber
but
good
overall
not
much
in
the
way
of
caramel
sweetness
but
it
is
balanced
pours
medium
dark
amber
mostly
see
through
touches
of
foam
remains
after
fast
fizzy
carbonation
bready
caramel
nose
jumps
out
of
the
glass
taste
is
a
sweet
caramel
sweetness
hangs
around
pretty
good
amber
a
very
one
dimensional
amber
drinkable
with
no
big
flaws
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
perfect
for
the
biscuit
lover
this
beer
went
down
nicely
and
when
it
was
done
could
have
had
another
maybe
the
beautiful
snowy
rocky
mountains
surroundings
and
high
altitude
make
the
beer
better
a
bit
weak
the
initial
fizz
fades
it
becomes
watery
but
the
taste
lingers
through
the
finish
hrmm
quite
average
i
think
this
is
fort
collins
answer
to
its
neighbors
bestseller
but
there
is
a
reason
fat
tire
sells
better
than
this
and
its
not
just
marketing
or
volume
conclusion
this
is
an
alright
version
of
this
style
of
beer
it
tastes
good
and
only
has
slightly
detectable
flaws
it
reminds
me
of
boston
lager
in
style
but
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
malt
flavors
achieved
in
said
beer
it
does
however
have
a
better
mouthfeel
with
more
texture

caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
some
cream
soda
sweetness
light
floral
hopping
with
honey
sweetness
on
the
finish
it
seems
that
more
caramel
malts
and
less
munich
or
vienna
malt
flavor
and
feel
leaves
me
wanting
more
elegance
and
firmness
and
then
with
a
clean
maltydry
closure
that
would
have
helped
this
beer
compete
with
negra
modelo
and
eliot

perhaps
nice
drinkable
beer
pours
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
films
rather
quickly
the
smell
reminds
me
of
dial
soap
uhoh
maybe
some
fruits
in
the
back
though
malt
does
shine
through
malty
taste
with
more
malt
on
the
swallow
slight
caramel
on
the
swallow
with
some
peppery
aspects
overall
this
beer
did
not
impress
too
much
low
alcohol
is
nice
for
a
change
but
a
little
more
character
and
heartiness
would
have
been
nice
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
but
its
at
least
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
pours
a
clear
light
copper
orange
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
random
streaks
of
lace

the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
light
malt
and
citrus

taste
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
citrus
zest
and
a
slight

flavor
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
amber
lager
but
nothing
exciting
going
on
here
overall
a
nicely
balanced
sessionable
and
easy
drinking
amber
ale
final
thought
not
bad
o
nothing
special
quite
bland
when
there
are
so
many
good
amber
ales
out
there
overall
your
basic
amber
lager
nothing
at
all
special
about
this
beer
o
ok
not
the
best
first
impression
but
i
was
starting
with
the
lightest
in
the
pack
hopefully
things
will
go
up
from
here
no
off
flavours
fairly
clean
just
nothing
interesting
i
grabbed
this
one
randomly
because
ft
collins
has
a
decent
lineup
its
a
nice
copper
color
with
low
carbonation
making
for
head
that
disappeared
in
seconds
to
make
a
horseshoeshaped
cap
the
aroma
was
light
with
a
pleasing
amount
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
good
for
a
lager
it
has
a
good
crispness
and
i
actually
enjoy
the
taste
unlike
many
lagers
ive
tried
this
is
one
i
could
have
several
of
its
great
for
the
style
and
well
just
nice
we
tried
this
one
with
friends
saturday
afternoon
up
at
the
brewery
in
fort
collins
pours
a
clean
amber
color
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
aromas
of
caramel
toasted
grains
and
sweet
malt
on
the
palate
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
flavors
of
biscuit
caramel
and
earthy
hops
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
decent
looking
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
looking
head
the
smell
was
of
biscuit
malts
and
some
hops
in
there
the
taste
has
a
light
citrusy
flavor
mixed
with
a
caramel
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
overall
id
say
give
it
a
try
nice
body
with
lively
carbonation
not
overly
complex
but
it
shouldnt
be
very
food
friendly
light
toffee
cereal
bread
with
a
good
amount
of
noble
hops
in
the
middle
and
finish
lively
floral
flavors
on
the
end
and
a
bit
earthy
throughout
better
than
i
expected
ive
been
relatively
underwhelmed
by
this
brewery
and
this
isnt
a
style
i
often
go
for
a
bit
bland
for
me
but
i
picked
this
up
on
a
singles
rack
in
one
of
my
local
stores
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
fairly
pleasantly
surprised
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
fairly
thin
head
that
leaves
some
sloppy
lacing
nice
bready
smell
with
a
bit
of
earthy
bitterness
and
some
late
tropical
fruit
notes
crisp
and
somewhat
substantial
at
the
same
time
in
the
mouth
with
more
of
that
breadiness
light
sweetness
anmd
fairly
firm
earthy
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
thinnessin
the
finish
and
it
could
use
some
more
length
but
some
spicy
hops
at
the
end
redeem
it
very
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
but
with
enough
body
and
character
to
keep
me
somewhat
interested
and
the
nice
spicy
hop
bite
went
well
with
some
dubliner
cheese
and
some
wheat
crackers
overall
if
the
flavor
is
not
there
why
bother
i
will
never
buy
this
beer
again
yet
another
fort
collins
beer
that
fails
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
is
awesome
this
amber
has
such
a
nice
balance
and
a
really
dtrong
taste
there
is
so
much
going
on
in
the
taste
but
everything
balances
well
enough
that
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
a
very
long
time
the
first
of
my
sample
pack
from
the
gettysburg
beer
mart
on
york
rd
always
fun
to
see
what
you
can
get
in
pa
that
you
cant
find
locally
nice
orange
color
in
the
glass
with
decent
tan
foam
that
laced
a
bit
going
down

and
a
somewhat
fresh
bright
scent
in
the
nosealmost
a

slightly

decidedly
colorado
style

n
for
the
use
of
that
termit

that
is
both
recognizable
and
very
pleasant
refreshing

bitter

a
good
thing
and
downright
good
to
drink
cant

to
try
the
rest
of
the

a
balanced
easily
drinkable

definitely
better
than

with
modest

this
would
be
my
favorite

of

appears
a
pale

hue
with
a
bright

nice
scattered
bands
of

background
going
on
this
is

is
light
as
well
with

flowing
with

carried
well
by
natural
carbonation
straight

crisp

lager
drinkability
is
nice
i
could
see
this
being
a
nice
crossover
brew
has
more
flavor
without
overpowering
any
senses
d
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
it
has
good
subtlety
and
just
enough
flavor
going
on
to
keep
me
interested
the
lightness
makes
it
easy
to
drink
multiples
certainly
drinkable
but
i
wish
ft
collins
would
list
the
abv
and
bottle
date
on
their
bottles
d
wonderfully
sessionable
this
is
a
treat
of
a
beer
i
didnt
expect
such
great
malt
sweetness
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
d
this
is
a
great
sessionable
beer
i
will
definitely
get
another
pint
of
this
one
d
fairly
drinkable
but
not
for
the
aroma
not
complex
b
ut
flavorful
and
fairly
balanced
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
less
complex
elliot
ness
i
dont
know
what
to
say
its
almost
like
beer
plagerism
did
they
actually
think
this
was
unique
i
give
this
a
straight
average
score
because
its
all
been
done
before
md
light
bubbly
feel
with
a
slight
dryness
in
the
mouth
the
drinkability
is
decent
when
you
hold
your
breath

drinkability
it
was
very
easy
drinking
and
quite
tasty
i
think
its
a
good
addition
to
the
lineup
of
ft
collins
brewing
it
was
an
ok
tasting
beer
i
bet
it
would
be
better
paired
with
a
good

pairs
nicely
with

i
read
the

of
this

while
i

its

they
do
better

of

though
overall
this

is

still

i
love
flying
dog
brewing
company
and
am
sad
to
see
it
leave
connecticut
but
hope
it
comes
back
soon
the
appearance
was
a
nice
dark
yellow
almost
orange
with
a
light
head
the
smell
is
full
of
malt
and
hops
very
effervescent
the
taste
is
sweet
in
the
beginning
with
the
malt
and
then
the
hops
give
a
bright
finish
hope
to
have
one
again
soon
overall
i
give
it
a
3
25
o
a
great
beer
that
i
would
certainly
buy
again
it
is
a
different
type
of
amber
lager
and
is
worth
a
buy
delicious
smooth
and
looks
wonderful
in
a
glass
in
front
of
you
a
relatively
plain
lager
nice
amber
color
smell
is
pretty
unappealing
taste
is
plain
comparable
to
more
mainstream
lagers
such
as
yeungling
or
sam
adams
flying
dog
is
an
excellent
brewery
specifically
in
regards
to
ale
but
this
lager
falls
relatively
short
of
what
ive
come
to
expect
o
as
a
lover
of
ambers
i
was
not
impressed
taste
was
not
there
not
enough
body
this
one
just
missed
the
mark
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
far
from
an
intense
beer
but
more
flavorful
than
your
typical
amber
lager
looking
for
a
good
amber
ale
this
could
be
your
beer
o
a
pretty
good
amber
lager
not
too
crazy
with
the
flavors
but
a
solid
brew
from
flying
dog
serving
type
bottle
flying
dog
is
a
brewery
which
tends
to
produce
consistently
excellent
beers
i
still
have
many
more
beers
in
the
lineup
to
try
but
in
the
past
theyve
very
rarely
disappointed
me
old
scratch
is
a
medium
to
dark
caramel
color
it
smells
sweet
and
taste
accordingly
it
is
noticeably
more
hopped
than
your
average
amber
lager
keeping
that
sweetness
in
check
the
beer
is
crisp
and
perfectly
carbonated
the
finish
is
short
and
hoppy
easy
drinking
and
delicious
check
it
out
o
fine
but
not
outstanding
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
nice
off
white
head
developed
though
retention
and
lacing
were
mild
appearance
was
a
nice
clear
to
copper
color
with
a
mild
aroma
with
light
notes
of
malt
and
toffee
tasted
of
caramel
and
toffee
sweet
with
a
medium
to
light
mouth
feel
aftertast
was
sweet
overall
nothing
mindblowing
but
a
tasty
drinkable
lager
middle
of
the
road
o
bought
the
beer
to
use
to
poach
some
salmon
which
turned
out
great
but
not
impressed
with
the
drinkability
o
not
something
that
stands
out
and
not
an
example
of
this
style
that
made
me
feel
it
stacks
up
well
to
its
competition
theres
just
not
much
that
sticks
out
about
it
it
is
a
very
easy
drinker
and
something
that
would
be
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
would
be
a
good
choice
for
company
thats
maybe
not
big
into
micros
amber
color
not
picking
up
much
of
an
odor
taste
is
okay
not
much
complexity
smooth
at
first
good
initial
flavor
but
has
no
aftertaste
id
like
for
it
to
have
a
little
more
depth
as
far
as
taste
is
concerned
it
tastes
watered
down
overall
its
an
okay
beer
better
than
domestics
but
not
outstanding
pours
a
true
amber
color
almost
no
nose
and
no
head
while
it
didnt
boast
of
anything
up
front
i
did
notice
a
little
floral
hops
character
some
bitterness
no
lacing
light
carbonation
the
body
of
this
beer
was
weak
and
unbalanced
it
had
a
flat
fruity
sweet
quality
that
really
detracted
form
the
essence
of
the
malt
overall
havent
had
a
lager
for
awhile
but
this
is
a
good
brew
i
would
recommend
i
imagine
this
would
go
very
well
with
food
but
it
is
highly
drinkable
on
its
own
food
friendly
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
suppose
if
you
were
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
this
is
not
a
bad
option
both
the
taste
and
smell
is
subtle
but
it
mixes
well
in
the
final
swallow
as
my
hand
warmed
the
glass
it
did
seem
to
make
the
whole
experience
a
bit
more
enjoyable
a
decent
drink
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
yum
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
this
beer
was
its
great
smell
it
has
a
really
refreshing
taste
without
being
totally
seltzery
awesome
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
a
great
beer
to
accompany
a
meal
im
having
some
berries
chocolate
and
almonds
with
mine
and
it
complements
them
well
it
was
hard
to
resist
chugging
overall
maybe
amber
lagers
are
just
not
my
thing
i
would
do
a
black
lager
or
a
lager
if
i
wanted
amber
i
would
just
have
a
brown
ale
that
being
said
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
in
an
airport
bar
at
5
5
abv
they
would
get
the
job
done
for
a
short
flight
i
could
also
see
them
mixing
well
with
dry
snack
mixes
and
and
potato
chips
overall
not
as
good
as
other
offerings
ive
had
from
flying
dog
o
about
average
amber
lager
looks
really
nice
though
overall
a
slightly
sweet
taste
with
a
nicely
roasted
malt
flavor
a
beer
that
is
worth
putting
in
the
rotation
light
on
the
lager
scale
overall
a
nice
blend
of
roast
sweet
and
hop
make
this
beer
a
good
easy
drinker
with
a
nice
smooth
flavor
and
taste
transitions
rather
tasty
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
amber
it
is
not
one
of
the
top
ones
but
has
its
place
in
the
middle
drinkable
and
solid
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
some
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
herbal
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
poorly
constructed
amber
lager
flying
dog
has
always
been
hitandmiss
with
me
and
this
is
definitely
a
miss
o
certainly
not
your
average
fizzy
yellow
lager
has
good
flavor
for
a
lager
and
plenty
of
malts
to
give
some
sweetness
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
lagers
overall
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
with
no
real
aftertaste
the
flavors
are
tasty
o
as
far
as
amber
lagers
go
this
one
ranks
up
there
with
the
best
of
em
this
is
one
of
those
offering
that
is
inoffensive
its
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
not
particularly
memorable
it
pours
a
deep
copper
with
not
much
head
and
poor
retention
of
that
and
no
observable
lacing
smell
is
bread
malt
citrus
and
roasted
nuts
mouthfeel
is
full
and
satisfying
taste
is
very
mild
with
the
expected
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
a
mild
bitter
on
the
finish
the
bottle
says
that
the
ibu
rating
is
19
5
it
is
not
all
that
bitter
but
it
seems
like
a
little
more
than
that
still
an
enjoyable
beer
one
that
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
d
a
simple
quaffable
lager
with
a
light
malty
presence
to
it
certainly
not
my
ideal
beer
but
this
wasnt
half
bad
a
lager
with
some
flavor
and
oh
so
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
not
sure
if
i
would
consider
it
a
shining
example
of
a
ca
common
o
never
had
a
steam
beer
but
have
had
a
couple
flying
dog
brews
in
the
past
and
they
are
the
new
brew
on
the
block
nothing
special
stands
out
to
me
about
this
brew
but
hopefully
some
others
will
either
way
its
a
different
style
and
worth
a
try
for
anyone
who
hasnt
had
a
steam
beer
copper
in
color
nose
has
nice
malty
and
bready
notes
the
flavor
profile
follows
the
nose
pretty
much
the
caramel
malt
is
apparent
and
the
body
is
fairly
hearty
for
the
style
ogood
beer
for
the
price
got
it
in
the
mix
pack
personaly
would
not
buy
it
because
im
not
a
lager
fan
this
is
a
great
lager
with
some
nice
qualities
i
cant
quite
find
the
california
common
characteristics
in
my
opinion
i
would
have
to
consider
this
more
of
a
vienna
lager
overall
just
had
it
for
first
time
but
pleasantly
surprised
also
bottles
for
2
50
were
a
sweet
deal
would
definitely
have
againrecommend
it
overall
im
not
big
into
steam
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
i
like
it
much
better
than
anchor
steam
which
most
would
consider
the
benchmark
for
steams
overall
on
par
with
what
you
would
expect
with
a
premium
lager
very
casually
drinkable
overall
a
very
middleoftheroad
amber
lager
i
would
not
have
guessed
this
is
a
steam
beer
but
caramel
malts
can
mask
a
lot
of
subtlety
overall
this
is
a
good
lager
it
proves
that
even
a
rather
basic
lager
does
not
mean
to
be
very
light
and
tasteless
the
old
scratch
has
robust
elements
in
all
aspects
and
its
a
serious
beer
light
amber
with
a
nice
full
and
fluffy
white
head
that
forms
and
sticks
around
pears
bread
and
yeast
in
the
nose
malty
nice
bitterness
with
a
good
piney
hop
flavor
going
on
bready
and
dry
on
the
palate
adequate
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
refreshing
and
crisp
this
is
a
good
example
flavor
wise
it
has
some
lagerlike
traits
with
mild
sweetness
and
subtle
caramel
tinges
with
a
nice
hint
of
hops
with
some
yeast
fruitiness
in
the
background
it
ends
mostly
dry
with
a
little
spice
and
the
carbonation
pushes
some
of
the
steamlike
qualities
forward
i
enjoyed
the
drinkability
of
this
and
would
purchase
it
again
its
alright
but
theres
no
wow
factor
to
it
this
beer
is
light
bodied
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
even
with
the
good
spice
notes
involved
and
the
bitterness
at
the
end
it
coats
most
of
your
mouth
and
leaves
you
dry
ready
and
waiting
for
the
next
sip
o
this
beer
seems
bold
at
first
but
quickly
mellows
out
in
the
mouth
and
leaves
only
the
slightest
of
nut
brown
memories
its
an
interesting
remix
of
some
classic
themes
but
not
one
im
likely
to
enjoy
again
the
caramelsugarsyrupy
quality
dominates
the
flavor
nose
and
mouthfeel
i
will
probably
avoid
in
the
future
this
beer
pours
a
bold
clear
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
and
some
fine
lacing
its
aroma
is
of
caramel
apples
spices
and
a
hint
of
maple
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
followed
through
by
ginger
and
pretzels
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
flying
dog
old
scratch
amber
lager
is
a
good
beer
a
good
example
of
the
style
recommended
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
seems
to
me
the
flying
dog
brews
were
better
when
brewed
in
colorado
nevertheless
these
east
coast
versions
are
okay
just
more
runofthemill
than
anything
else
nice
sessionable
very
good
with
food
now
i
see
i
am
45
of
a
deviation
from
the
mean
which
is
really
a
lot
i
wonder
if
i
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
or
so
i
have
the
beer
sitting
right
next
to
me
so
it
is
what
it
is
i
suppose
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
overall
pretty
decent
none
of
the
individual
parts
did
anything
exceptionally
well
but
all
of
the
pieces
fit
together
to
make
something
fairly
enjoyable
not
overly
complicated
but
kind
of
elegant
in
its
own
way
half
way
decent
beer
o
not
to
much
flavor
but
with
small
bitter
taste
at
the
end
this
was
tasted
at
a
slightly
chilled
temperature
might
be
better
at
a
colder
temp
overall
not
terribly
impressed
by
this
one
too
thin
and
lacking
in
flavor
to
make
this
beer
one
to
look
forward
to
its
good
to
have
a
nice
lager
to
turn
to
every
now
and
then
what
with
all
the
dipas
and
russian
imperial
stouts
aged
in
oak
barrels
with
a
hint
of
smoked
salmon
and
chili
peppers
running
around
these
days
i
enjoy
this
beer
overall
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
brew
will
need
to
try
again
maybe
on
tap
taste
is
likewise
malty
and
toasty
even
sweet
comparable
to
fat
tire
but
a
mite
sweeter
and
possibly
more
oxidized
as
i
think
this
bottle
may
have
been
past
its
prime
no
freshness
dating
overall
fair
at
best
overall
a
really
nice
easy
drinking
session
lager
would
make
a
good
goto
beer
to
have
on
hand
in
the
fridge
overall
this
doesnt
quite
fit
the
style
for
me
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
super
special
about
it
nice
easy
drinking
beer
simple
and
tasty
well
balanced
malt
and
hop
combination
overall
nice
brew
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
its
almost
as
enjoyable
to
look
at
as
it
is
to
drink
the
smell
was
nothing
too
exciting
very
light
on
the
nose
it
doesnt
smell
bad
i
just
wish
it
was
deeper
taste
is
great
its
all
about
that
apricot
aftertaste
that
leaves
you
feeling
very
mellow
i
didnt
like
the
syrup
sensation
i
got
in
the
back
of
my
throat
after
a
few
sips
and
the
carbonation
was
noting
to
shake
a
stick
at
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
i
would
get
again
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
maybe
its
subliminally
awesome
because
im
a
hunter
fan
but
this
beer
deserves
to
be
endorsed
by
the
gonzo
himself
kudos
flying
dog
pretty
good
not
must
have
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
try
again
overall
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
offer
anything
to
get
me
to
come
back
for
more
neither
a
session
nor
a
tasting
beer
its
clean
enough
and
drinkable
in
a
bland
and
fatalistic
way
it
doesnt
inspire
you
to
drink
better
beer
unfortunatelyit
makes
you
just
resigned
to
the
fact
that
this
is
what
beer
is
going
to
be
its
kind
of
depressing
poured
a
2
offwhite
head
clear
dark
amber
color
rather
pretty
smells
richly
of
malt
but
i
dont
really
pick
anything
else
up
taste
also
is
rich
malt
didnt
change
much
as
it
warmed
up
and
was
pretty
light
and
clean
id
say
this
sample
is
yummy
just
not
very
complex
i
really
liked
this
beer
which
was
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
good
job
d
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
style
so
i
cant
compare
it
to
others
its
a
decent
beer
but
could
be
balanced
much
better
osimilar
to
how
i
remembered
it
nothing
much
out
of
the
ordinary
here
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
ok
but
could
also
use
some
bittering
it
lacks
the
dry
woodiness
that
makes
anchor
steam
beer
highly
drinkable
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
rather
smoothly
written
as
i
tasted
o
great
appearance
and
better
than
average
smell
build
up
expectations
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
a
huge
let
down
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
sense
it
has
the
drinkability
of
water
ive
had
this
before
and
really
liked
it
perhaps
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
again
not
really
my
style
of
cup
of
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewer
its
not
really
memorable
but
its
definitely
decent
enough
to
warrant
trying
at
least
once
this
is
a
very
solid
amber
lagersteam
beer
i
enjoy
the
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
good
overall
this
beer
was
okay
not
as
bad
as
tire
bite
but
definitely
not
a
star
in
the
lineup
overall
nice
beer
pretty
refreshing
nice
taste
profile
o
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
has
a
very
thin
watery
taste
to
it
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
and
some
bready
notes
medium
smooth
body
caramel
malt
is
balanced
by
earthy
peppery
hops
on
the
palate
long
peppery
dry
finish
not
a
bad
brew
the
feel
is
pretty
decent
light
feel
to
it
with
soft
carbonation
overall
not
bad
just
nothing
special
here
easily
approachable
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
only
a
thin
sandcolored
head
despite
a
vigorous
pour
the
aroma
is
light
and
malty
with
a
mild
berrylike
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
graininess
the
flavor
is
likewise
lightly
sweet
with
a
thin
caramel
character
and
a
dry
breadiness
and
maybe
some
light
lemony
hops
creeping
into
the
finish
any
deeper
flavor
complexity
is
hard
to
identify
because
of
the
fine
yet
assertive
prickly
carbonation
that
feels
a
bit
harsh
overall
although
theres
nothing
necessarily
wrong
with
the
flavor
im
just
not
impressed
dr
fairly
drinkable
excepting
the
lackluster
quality
overpriced
as
part
of
the
sampler
pack
i
wont
have
it
again
thanks
to
sully
for
getting
this
to
me
nice
amber
appearance
as
i
pured
into
my
tusker
pilsener
glass
small
amount
of
head
but
some
nice
beige
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
malty
and
sweet
at
first
taste
is
very
complex
for
a
lager
some
maltiness
and
maple
syrup
qualities
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
a
nice
amber
lager
not
too
far
off
from
the
anchor
steam
but
a
tad
sweeter
and
maltier
overall
a
decent
amber
lager
with
good
flavors
but
with
a
few
shortcomings
that
prevent
it
from
getting
aboveaverage
marks
i
could
drink
many
of
these
and
i
would
say
that
5
5
is
higher
than
i
would
think
this
beer
is
not
an
exciting
beer
but
not
a
bad
one
do
this
amberwhatever
features
little
to
recommend
it
while
being
saddled
with
excessive
acidity
although
it
is
not
outright
undrinkable
this
beer
is
utterly
forgettable
and
probably
best
relegated
to
cooking
applications
overall
nice
beer
bit
underrated
for
the
style
grenadine
nose
that
becomes
a
bit
of
time
with
the
caramel
light
body
still
quite
heavy
and
with
a
special
flavor
perhaps
a
little
too
strong
perhaps
too
much
mixing
of
tastes
and
making
a
grave
mistake
association
one
finds
loose
slightly
roasted
malt
but
also
fruity
and
a
little
alcohol
many
flavors
but
a
bit
too
stodgy
for
a
californian
common
overall
not
a
bad
effort
from
flying
dog
i
enjoy
most
amber
ales
and
lagers
so
this
was
a
nice
addition
much
maltier
and
sweeter
than
im
used
to
but
good
overall
and
very
relaxing
a
goto
for
the
autumn
season
maybe
final
notes
drink
this
one
cold
to
avoid
the
grainy
taste
a
simple
lager
nothing
special
but
its
great
for
when
you
want
a
beer
thats
not
overbearing
and
that
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
easily
good
introduction
to
better
beer
d
this
has
decent
drinkability
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
the
flavor
isnt
all
that
great
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
and
it
isnt
too
bad
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
thought
it
was
alright
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
o
pretty
middle
of
the
road
amber
lager
i
felt
like
it
was
generic
and
somewhat
onenote
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
but
i
would
never
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
overall
a
very
well
crafted
lager
with
complex
pronounced
flavors
and
aggression
on
the
finish
recommended
for
more
experienced
craft
drinkers
as
like
i
mentioned
before
i
know
i
tried
this
years
ago
when
i
was
a
less
experience
beer
drinkertaster
and
it
tasted
bitter
and
rough
to
me
for
the
bas
i
recommend
this
overall
not
impressed
but
a
very
drinkable
cali
common
brew
overall
pretty
much
an
average
amber
not
terrible
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
from
a
crowd
though
i
probably
would
pass
on
another
round
of
this
one
in
favor
of
something
more
flavorful
d
its
an
amber
not
the
greatest
but
pretty
good
id
drink
more
but
im
not
going
to
seek
it
out
overall
a
decent
amber
a
mediocre
amber
an
amber
o
not
the
worst
beer
out
there
but
for
my
money
i
could
get
better
amber
lagers
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavors
didnt
leave
me
wanting
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
at
50
degrees
pours
a
hazy
burnt
red
with
a
bubbly
band
around
the
shoulders
and
a
soapy
slick
across
the
surface
band
eventually
settles
into
a
tight
circle
with
no
other
foam
across
the
surface
no
lacing
on
this
one
nose
is
quite
malty
with
hints
of
carameltoffee
and
figs
or
prunes
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
there
is
also
a
faint
earthyspicy
character
that
cuts
across
the
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
crisp
carbonation
all
and
all
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
with
more
character
than
i
anticipated
well
worth
a
try
i
just
want
to
point
out
this
beer
is
very
true
to
its
style
its
always
good
to
have
them
they
give
you
a
point
of
reference
and
reverence
its
got
a
pleasant
taste
throughout
and
its
got
a
great
citrus
quality
to
it
setting
at
19
5
ibu
combined
with
hints
of
caramel
and
citrus
is
like
a
bunch
of
angry
little
leprechauns
bouncing
on
see
saws
on
your
palate
a
must
have
in
the
cooler
this
summer
for
sure
o
i
wouldnt
buy
this
when
i
make
a
better
amber
ale
than
this
boring
beer
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
nothing
extraordinary
but
something
you
can
happily
drink
without
any
fuss
if
i
had
to
compare
it
i
would
say
it
is
similar
levels
of
sweetness
and
hops
to
sam
adams
with
the
same
overall
drinkability
finish
stickiness
on
the
lips
not
bad
not
great
translucent
copper
body
had
to
coax
out
the
head
smells
grainy
and
watery
with
a
little
butteriness
in
the
backgroud
tastes
grainy
as
well
lightly
hopped
just
enough
to
get
you
to
notice
a
little
fruity
as
it
warms
not
bad
not
gonna
look
for
it
in
the
bar
or
at
the
store
a
treading
water
beer
even
with
all
that
being
said
its
still
not
that
bad
a
beer
but
i
cant
rate
it
that
high
since
it
just
doesnt
feel
that
great
and
has
some
issues
i
have
been
away
from
flying
dog
for
too
long
and
i
forgot
that
they
are
one
of
the
gateways
that
got
me
into
the
craft
beer
world
nice
and
soothing
an
easily
accessible
amber
o
great
beer
for
the
style
its
not
my
favorite
kind
but
this
beer
turns
me
back
to
lagers
really
surprised
with
how
flavorful
this
beer
was
could
see
some
problems
with
people
thinking
it
was
slightly
too
weak
as
it
is
initially
but
finishes
with
lots
of
taste
so
a
very
good
amber
lager
imo
the
beer
was
a
pretty
stand
looking
amber
lager
the
pour
was
pretty
good
it
had
a
nice
looking
head
on
it
that
had
a
little
yellowish
color
too
it
the
look
of
the
beer
is
pretty
nice
lots
of
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
glass
and
adding
to
the
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
of
hops
and
malts
lightly
roasted
aroma
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
which
is
pretty
nice
for
the
style
im
happy
that
it
wasnt
overly
watered
down
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
it
can
be
enjoyed
by
many
and
the
drinkability
is
good
here
o
obviously
not
the
most
sought
after
style
but
i
knew
i
would
be
at
the
bar
awhile
and
i
had
the
server
keep
these
coming
it
was
cheap
and
drinkable
i
would
definitely
revisit
this
for
a
decent
price
also
i
would
like
to
note
that
my
girlfriend
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
which
says
a
lot
d
makes
a
decent
winter
session
beer
cheers
good
on
its
own
better
paired
with
sweeter
food
this
is
an
easy
drinker
for
almost
any
beer
drinker
craft
or
bmc
although
this
goes
down
with
very
little
effort
lagers
like
this
really
aint
my
thing
i
would
turn
this
down
for
pretty
much
any
ale
worth
a
spot
in
the
variety
pack
but
i
would
never
really
buy
this
on
its
own
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
it
isnt
amazing
but
its
worth
drinking
the
carbonation
is
just
too
high
takes
away
any
level
of
flavor
this
beer
did
have
old
scratch
is
not
bad
for
a
lager
almost
close
to
an
ale
one
of
the
better
amber
lagers
i
have
had
to
date
this
lager
is
very
drinkable
as
are
most
leaving
no
strange
bite
or
mouth
puckering
aftertaste
this
is
a
solid
lager
that
is
now
on
my
list
of
respectable
beers
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
that
has
a
very
light
feel
to
it
but
does
not
really
stand
out
significantly
from
any
other
amber
lagers
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
amber
its
balanced
between
sweet
and
bitter
a
soft
sweet
smell
a
little
bit
of
liqueur
syrup
and
nut
the
rather
small
creamy
beige
head
disappeared
rather
fast
the
body
is
orangered
in
the
beginning
the
taste
is
light
soft
the
finish
is
more
bitter
the
duration
is
normal
the
body
is
medium
strong
dry
and
creamy
with
normal
carbonation
a
nice
beer
drinkability
friendly
but
not
as
good
as
other
ambers
its
nothing
special
but
its
not
offputting
either
d
fairly
good
worth
trying
but
not
running
to
the
store
for
more
drinkability
very
interesting
brew
with
a
very
morphic
type
of
taste
very
cool
a
pretty
desent
beer
i
just
think
they
could
bring
up
the
flavor
a
little
bit
d
a
nice
drinkable
beer
although
its
pretty
neutral
not
a
lot
of
jazz
this
was
a
solid
red
lager
poured
a
reddish
amber
with
big
head
that
receded
rather
quickly
smelled
of
oily
hops
and
some
lightly
toasted
malt
tasted
of
hops
but
it
was
understated
buttery
caramel
came
into
play
later
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
and
i
believe
that
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
amber
lager
pretty
decent
mouth
feel
nice
carbonation
and
not
watery
id
say
its
somewhere
between
light
and
medium
on
the
palate
its
pretty
drinkable
too
overall
a
really
nice
lager
it
surprised
me
i
havent
had
a
lager
since
summer
the
malts
reminded
me
of
an
ale
the
mouth
feel
is
actually
better
than
some
ales
ive
had
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
in
the
last
couple
months
and
i
really
like
it
its
a
really
good
tasting
amber
beer
flying
dog
has
some
really
nice
label
designs
and
names
for
their
beer
and
this
one
is
no
different
ill
definitely
be
adding
this
to
my
inventory
when
i
see
it
in
the
store
this
was
a
vey
easy
beer
to
drink
the
flavor
was
good
and
well
balanced
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
basically
normal
for
the
lager
style
just
a
good
drinkable
lager
wont
amaze
but
its
still
a
welcome
part
of
the
flying
dog
mix
packs
d
after
the
smell
i
was
a
little
worried
but
this
one
came
together
nicely
a
good
session
beer
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
has
a
bit
of
a
winter
warmer
like
quality
to
it
a
little
bit
of
wood
and
heat
with
red
feel
cant
really
get
much
to
differentiate
the
lager
style
of
this
tastes
like
a
red
ale
through
and
through
barely
a
hop
presence
to
it
but
for
a
mellow
ride
this
stuff
gets
the
trick
done
good
times
that
march
madness
notes
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
yet
from
flying
dog
but
it
is
far
from
being
the
best
amber
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
a
taste
that
i
am
used
to
in
an
amber
lager
i
like
the
difference
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
nothing
significant
taste
is
ok
and
there
is
no
complexity
but
its
not
hard
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
stands
out
as
more
than
average
not
one
of
flying
dogs
more
memorable
beers
but
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
taste
was
lacking
for
me
that
could
come
from
the
fact
that
my
favorite
beers
are
porters
and
stouts
that
being
said
it
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
hit
the
lake
with
in
the
summer
i
would
not
buy
it
by
itself
in
a
6pack
but
would
by
the
flying
dog
pack
again
for
sure
great
beer
flying
dog
quite
smooth
with
a
good
body
and
light
effervescence
aftertaste
is
a
bit
hoppier
and
slightly
dry
reminiscent
of
a
pale
ale
stylistically
off
but
a
good
brew
nonetheless
decent
brew
but
not
very
tasty
maaybe
its
an
old
bottle
so
its
not
too
impressive
the
mouthfeel
was
fine
but
i
believe
most
ambers
are
it
was
very
drinkable
as
i
finished
off
a
6
pack
during
just
the
first
game
on
sunday
this
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
almost
amber
color
and
had
somewhat
of
an
off
white
head
to
it
the
aroma
smells
rich
in
caramel
malts
almost
a
toasty
smell
too
the
taste
is
sweet
with
the
taste
of
caramel
malts
there
is
also
a
hint
of
spicy
noble
hops
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
and
i
would
consider
this
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
no
problem
it
seems
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
little
higher
abv
than
normal
with
a
5
5
so
you
could
have
a
few
until
you
get
a
buzz
drink
easily
drinkable
i
could
definite
session
beer
i
could
down
more
than
a
few
of
these
nice
color
lacing
head
not
much
smell
at
all
if
any
smooth
lightly
toasted
malt
flavor
nothing
extraordinary
decent
mouthfeel
smooth
good
carbonation
slightly
bitter
finish
good
session
beer
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
quaffable
old
scratch
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
think
light
khaki
head
the
sweet
malty
nose
lends
itself
to
aromas
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
unlike
the
nose
the
flavor
is
not
sweet
at
all
an
amber
lager
that
does
not
do
much
to
make
a
tremendous
overall
flavor
impression
yet
at
the
same
time
does
not
offend
light
on
the
malt
and
flavor
in
general
theres
a
little
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
this
isnt
a
beer
to
ponder
really
its
just
an
average
drinker
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
piney
hops
and
grain
notes
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
toffee
caramel
and
tea
as
well
as
some
grassy
and
citrus
notes
from
the
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
put
down
a
lot
of
these
at
once
nice
malty
brew
d
refreshing
this
aids
drinkability
amber
color
light
brown
with
a
shade
of
red
the
head
retention
was
there
at
a
14
but
quickly
went
away
after
a
few
seconds
it
is
very
clear
and
lightly
carbonated
smells
sweet
and
roasty
sharp
on
the
tongue
but
smooth
going
down
sits
on
the
stomach
well
seems
more
carbonated
drinking
it
than
it
appears
in
the
glass
mild
soft
light
taste
with
a
clean
clear
aftertaste
watery
smooth
and
a
little
flat
overall
a
good
clean
beer
nothing
dirty
about
it
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
like
it
easy
drinking
looks
great
in
the
glass
and
had
an
above
average
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
great
fall
session
brew
i
hope
i
can
pick
this
up
again
sometime
i
was
expecting
an
average
brew
but
to
me
this
is
a
few
steps
above
average
d
not
an
overpowering
beer
just
a
nice
easy
drinker
good
for
a
few
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
great
amber
look
that
gives
credit
to
the
amber
lager
description
though
it
does
not
drive
ones
sense
of
smell
wild
its
balanced
taste
has
a
mild
bite
with
smooth
sweet
after
tones
that
will
tickle
your
tongue
the
taste
is
complimented
by
a
strong
carbonation
as
the
beer
gently
washes
around
your
mouth
without
filling
it
with
foam
d
really
well
balanced
all
around
all
of
the
pieces
fit
together
nicely
and
make
a
smooth
flavorful
beer
that
is
very
nice
to
drink
i
finally
found
one
i
found
a
flying
dog
i
like
thank
god
i
was
beginning
to
lose
hope
from
the
last
two
i
tried
but
on
a
serious
note
this
is
overall
a
good
lager
i
recommend
it
if
you
prefer
lagers
but
be
wary
that
it
isnt
up
to
caliber
to
the
best
of
the
best
lagers
its
a
safe
choice
and
i
enjoy
it
i
will
most
likely
buy
this
again
dvery
drinkable
i
may
not
seek
this
out
should
i
be
looking
for
something
new
it
was
good
but
not
overwhelmly
good
overall
this
a
pretty
mediocre
amber
not
too
bad
but
not
too
good
either
d
given
its
lack
of
flavours
this
is
one
i
would
have
as
an
appetizer
so
to
speak
such
a
shame
all
the
different
aromaas
are
not
present
on
the
palate
for
an
amber
lager
this
is
a
bit
on
the
coarse
side
it
has
a
nice
robustness
to
it
in
the
taste
but
it
never
really
gets
anywhere
d
its
a
great
amber
beer
and
well
worth
it
drinkability
is
okay
i
would
prefer
more
of
a
hop
balance
in
this
one
it
gets
a
little
heavy
which
prevents
it
from
being
the
solid
session
beer
the
style
probably
dictates
d
not
a
very
enjoyable
beer
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
metallic
smell
and
taste
which
was
odd
i
wouldnt
order
it
again
very
drinkable
however
for
the
price
range
id
rather
have
a
good
local
brew
taste
is
nice
toasted
grain
lightly
caramelised
bread
crust
slight
fruity
wine
hint
with
herbal
leaves
and
wood
mineral
citrus
pulp
hint
and
slightly
peppery
sharp
bitterness
light
sweetness
balanced
by
light
sweetness
the
latter
just
dominating
at
the
crisp
finish
all
linger
nicely
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
really
good
and
very
drinkable
d
a
very
good
session
beer
not
quite
a
standalone
but
great
to
have
in
conjunction
with
a
handful
of
like
beers
d
boy
i
was
thirsty
and
boy
was
this
ever
satisfying
and
with
a
good
abv
its
a
sessioner
honestly
id
compare
this
favourably
with
a
great
lakes
elliot
ness
amber
lager
as
the
french
say
bonne
merde
d
fairly
drinkable
though
at
the
price
point
i
can
think
of
several
other
beers
id
rather
session
theres
a
not
hop
bitterness
going
on
that
coats
the
mouth
in
an
unpleasant
way
very
carbonated
smooth
and
drinkable
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
honestly
im
depressed
i
have
a
second
bottle
awaiting
me
in
the
fridge
overall
to
me
this
beer
was
reminiscent
to
yeungling
a
favorite
of
mine
but
i
was
looking
for
something
different
d
a
strong
start
to
the
12
pack
this
lager
is
a
pleasant
sipping
beer
with
a
solid
flavor
profile
i
picked
this
up
by
accident
and
did
not
expect
it
to
be
good
at
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
pretty
damn
good
once
you
get
past
that
wet
burlap
sack
aroma
very
nice
dark
amber
color
around
17
on
srm
better
than
average
head
with
great
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
sweet
hop
smell
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sits
well
in
my
mouth
nice
firm
flavor
yet
not
but
a
touch
bitter
label
shows
ibu
of
19
5
this
bottle
closer
to
14
to
15
very
little
aftertaste
except
a
semi
sweet
faint
hop
flavor
taste
better
as
it
warms
nice
amount
of
buzz
factor
makes
my
nostrils
flare
would
buy
this
one
to
share
with
others
will
sample
this
one
again
again
for
sure
overall
kind
of
disappointing
i
was
expecting
more
but
it
was
very
simple
not
unpleasant
but
entirely
underwhelming
taste
is
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
and
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
although
it
is
hard
to
tell
the
beer
tastes
watery
and
weak
with
the
tastes
being
less
than
expected
from
the
style
and
the
color
of
the
beer
it
is
a
struggle
to
find
words
to
describe
the
flavors
as
they
are
hard
to
find
there
isnt
much
difference
in
taste
up
front
and
throughout
each
sip
and
it
doesnt
leave
much
quite
smooth
and
very
drinkable
but
there
isnt
much
to
savor
so
i
didnt
enjoy
it
much
d
the
brew
drank
quite
well
and
was
pretty
good
paired
with
some
breaded
shrimps
as
the
name
suggests
this
beer
pours
a
medium
amber
with
some
nice
burnt
orange
tones
it
has
a
pretty
average
looking
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
pretty
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
bready
grainy
grassy
and
slightly
toasty
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
flavors
include
deep
bready
malt
grain
dry
grass
toffee
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
all
the
flavors
are
very
clean
but
seem
a
bit
uninspiring
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
has
a
certain
chewy
quality
to
it
ample
carbonation
bounces
around
on
my
tongue
before
i
swallow
and
partake
of
a
long
slightly
stinging
finish
that
fades
to
a
somewhat
dry
and
hoppy
aftertaste
this
beer
has
decent
drinkability
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
really
seek
out
another
glass
drinkability
is
soso
nothing
here
makes
me
want
this
one
in
a
sixer
its
pretty
inoffensive
tho
and
might
be
good
to
wean
bmc
drinkers
into
enjoying
better
beers
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
frothy
head
and
large
bubbles
kinda
spongelike
it
has
nice
carbonation
and
a
nice
toffy
flavor
and
smell
to
it
has
a
nice
strongerthanmedium
body
that
lingers
for
some
time
i
would
defiantly
buy
this
beer
again
as
the
experience
of
drinking
this
was
quite
nice
plus
i
have
a
flying
dog
old
scratch
glass
to
drink
it
from
when
i
first
poured
this
one
it
had
a
nice
color
with
a
decent
head
it
has
the
aroma
of
a
standard
amber
the
taste
was
less
than
i
was
hoping
for
with
a
bitter
and
almost
unpleasant
finish
i
do
not
feel
that
this
beer
is
worthy
of
the
flying
dog
title
and
has
a
great
deal
of
room
for
improvement
in
taste
drinkable
decent
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
md
moderate
body
soft
carbonation
no
alcohol
apparent
good
drinkable
amber
ale
nothing
extraordinary
but
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
is
average
i
could
split
a
6pack
with
a
friend
served
in
a
sam
adams
pint
glass
about
2
inches
of
thick
foamy
head
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
some
mildly
hoppy
flavor
and
well
balanced
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
smooth
very
drinkable
it
was
quite
easy
to
enjoy
2
or
more
of
these
a
thick
cloudy
head
that
got
me
a
little
amped
up
but
nothing
much
after
that
not
much
smell
not
much
taste
what
was
i
here
for
basic
basic
basic
not
bad
but
basic
all
and
all
it
was
a
drinkable
brew
but
i
asked
myself
why
i
would
ever
come
back
to
it
didnt
strike
me
as
an
american
amber
either
always
weird
when
i
have
beers
like
this
not
much
to
say
other
than
give
it
a
try
you
might
like
d
solidly
built
and
drinkable
but
nothing
amazing
i
got
it
in
a
mixed
12
pack
am
happy
i
tried
it
wont
necessarily
go
back
and
get
a
sixer
overall
a
decent
brew
just
kinda
flawed
nothing
youd
spit
out
but
nothing
youd
call
all
of
your
friends
about
either
solid
and
drinkable
drinkability
an
average
amber
drinkable
enough
that
if
i
bought
a
six
i
would
not
be
disappointed
but
there
is
no
need
to
rush
out
and
get
this
again
the
fruittea
combo
does
not
work
for
me
d
i
guess
its
drinkable
im
getting
a
waterlike
texture
from
it
at
points
which
i
guess
you
could
drink
tastes
more
like
a
cider
like
a
woodchuck
to
be
personally
would
not
buy
again
buy
again
yes
an
excellent
satisfying
and
highly
drinkable
beer
from
a
brewery
that
is
rapidly
moving
up
in
my
regard
recommended
medium
carbonation
and
body
tending
just
towards
the
heavier
side
goes
down
smoothly
enough
but
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
light
a
good
medium
body
to
this
beer
is
does
go
down
well
and
leaves
a
slight
weight
to
it
as
it
clears
the
pallet
drinkabillity
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
a
bit
heavy
for
me
so
i
would
have
to
really
want
more
than
one
if
i
was
going
to
have
2
or
more
this
brew
pours
a
deep
amberorange
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
two
finger
head
and
sticky
lacing
here
and
thereit
has
aromas
of
carameltoffee
malts
and
some
resinous
hopsand
on
taste
its
exactly
like
the
aroma
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
the
first
taste
i
get
followed
by
some
piney
resinous
hops
on
finish
to
give
it
a
nice
sweetbitter
finish
but
mostly
sweetoverall
if
this
wasnt
so
highly
priced
i
would
like
it
as
a
session
beer
but
given
its
hefty
price
tag
for
a
brew
that
isnt
that
memorable
i
dont
think
ill
be
rushing
out
and
buying
it
again
but
would
revisit
one
day
a
nice
amber
lager
clean
drinkable
with
the
balance
slightly
towards
the
malt
everything
this
style
should
be
i
am
a
big
fan
of
sackets

this
is
a
step
above
what
a
great

down

i
love
it
md
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
ale
the
further
down
the
glass
the
better
the
beer
tastes
i
began
with
a
3

changed
it
to
a

the
time
i
was

from

bottle
marked

sampled
on
april

2010
the
color
of
the
pour
is
an
enticing
amber
with
a
quarter
inch
head
the
fades
away
to
nothing
in
about
a
minute
excellent
clarity
inviting
hops
and
a
modest
wheat
aroma
lead
the
way
on
the
nose
with
a
dash
of
fruitiness
in
the
background
the
body
comes
in
at
about
medium
the
taste
is
subtle
as
a
rule
with
a
modest
hops
malts
and
bread
gathering
together
for
an
enjoyable
but
not
an
extraordinary
experience
d
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
it
looks
nice
goes
down
easy
and
is
if
not
pleasing
certainly
passable
this
beer
is
certainly
mellow
as
advertised
the
flavors
are
very
mild
and
pleasant
balanced
towards
the
sweet
side
with
only
a
little
bitter
a
nice
easy
drinking
relaxing
beer
d
nothing
to
really
seek
out
again
but
a
good
beer
for
the
variety
pack
that
stands
right
beside
the
pale
ale
and
porter
a
decent
member
of
the
family
dont
bother
with
this
one
d
good
drinkability
good
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
1
12
finger
head
that
didnt
leave
any
lacing
all
i
get
in
the
nose
is
heavy
carmel
malt
and
slight
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
carmel
malt
very
sweet
decent
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
trying
but
its
not
an
exceptional
lager
real
nice
looking
brew
amber
color
very
clear
with
what
looks
to
be
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
has
a
nice
sized
tan
head
that
did
break
down
quite
quickly
but
did
leave
a
sheet
of
foam
at
the
top
of
the
liquid
and
some
good
lacing
the
aroma
really
has
a
strong
malt
presence
caramel
and
slightly
grainy
also
there
seems
to
be
something
there
that
is
not
overly
present
but
gives
a
slight
stale
scent
as
i
think
about
it
more
it
becomes
a
little
more
offensive
too
bad
because
the
12
pack
looked
to
have
a
sticker
that
said
it
was
fresh
till
april
of
this
year
the
flavor
seems
to
be
pretty
good
caramel
but
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
the
hops
make
a
quick
appearance
at
the
end
and
then
disappears
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
adds
a
nice
mix
with
the
hops
at
the
end
this
is
a
ok
brew
but
as
i
have
seen
with
the
other
brews
from
flying
dog
there
are
better
examples
and
tasting
brews
that
are
common
place
around
here
overall
decent
but
average
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wont
be
searching
it
out
drinkable
but
a
little
to
much
on
the
sweet
side
i
think
this
could
be
better
with
just
a
little
more
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
mild
carbonation
for
the
style
not
a
bad
session
beer
i
could
put
away
a
few
if
you
handed
them
to
me
its
not
going
to
make
me
put
away
the
brooklyn
lager
though
did
order
this
at
a
bar
if
there
was
nothing
more
exciting
but
if
i
was
having
a
lager
admittedly
not
my
favorite
style
this
wouldnt
necessarily
be
my
first
choice
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
magnificent
foamy
tan
head
smells
of
light
cereal
grains
and
a
faint
grassiness
taste
is
rather
thin
light
cereal
grains
followed
by
a
slightly
metallic
hop
bitterness
not
much
else
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
semidry
finish
i
would
reach
for
a
brooklyn
lager
or
sa
boston
lager
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
a
dry
clean
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
but
not
really
crisp
d
pretty
flavorful
lager
thats
mild
overall
but
ill
take
this
over
a
macro
lager
any
day
d
goes
down
smooth
enough
but
i
feel
like
ive
predisposed
myself
to
not
like
beer
with
higher
fusel
alcohols
d
excellent
drinkability
very
smooth
amber
lager
easy
for
a
non
beer
drinker
to
like
and
great
malty
ale
taste
for
the
more
experienced
hophead
i
drink
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
these
days
i
tend
to
drink
more
ales
then
lagers
and
it
has
a
ale
touch
to
it
which
could
be
good
or
bad
how
you
look
at
it
i
liked
this
combo
personally
pours
with
a
light
brown
color
very
very
thin
head
that
diminished
quickly
transparent
body
smells
mostly
of
malts
and
perhaps
a
little
cinnamon
im
probably
wrong
but
the
smell
has
that
sort
of
tingle
to
it
the
taste
is
like
other
amber
lagers
ive
had
a
little
less
bite
than
ive
tried
which
was
more
tolerable
for
me
has
a
good
bite
with
a
bitter
ending
drinking
a
few
of
these
would
be
a
chore
pours
a
dark
amber
reddish
color
body
with
almost
no
head
quickly
diminishing
nutty
malty
aroma
vegetablyfruity
some
honey
sugars
dark
fruit
vegetably
fruit
essence
honey
malty
not
very
nutty
not
very
tasty
better
as
it
warms
less
vegetably
still
not
a
favorite
d
for
me
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
it
goes
down
easily
enough
a
little
more
complexity
would
be
nice
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
that
brings
something
to
the
table
but
doesnt
really
impress
in
the
way
that
it
could
good
but
not
great
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
thin
yellowywhite
head
very
light
malty
slightly
hoppy
smell
pretty
hard
to
pick
up
the
flavor
is
malty
with
some
slightly
citrus
hop
flavor
making
an
appearance
towards
the
end
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
thin
and
leaves
me
wishing
for
a
little
bit
more
substance
as
does
the
flavor
while
it
is
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
the
aroma
flavor
and
mouth
feel
could
all
be
a
bit
stronger
for
my
liking
drinkability
not
to
heavy
it
would
be
conceivable
to
drink
a
few
in
a
row
however
there
are
better
beers
on
the
shelf
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
and
hops
taste
of
malts
lightly
hopped
a
touch
of
sweetness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
clean
and
tasty
lightly
toasted
with
some
citrus
hop
and
bubblegum
nice
the
nose
of
this
brew
hints
at
the
slight
malty
sweetness
on
the
back
end
along
with
a
balanced
bitterness
crisp
nice
and
mouth
watering
overall
impressions
very
interesting
in
that
it
drinks
like
a
lager
but
has
some
flavors
and
characteristics
of
an
ale
likely
at
least
in
part
a
result
of
brewing
at
a
more
medium
temperature
in
comparison
to
many
lagers
enjoyable
and
would
drink
again
a
great
clean
lager
with
just
enough
complexity
and
a
remarkable
level
of
drinkability
this
has
the
makings
of
a
refrigerator
staple
this
beer
was
extremely
good
it
poors
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
hint
of
bronze
tastes
a
little
malty
but
is
definatly
a
sweeter
beer
poored
into
my
boston
lager
sam
adams
glass
i
enjoy
this
brewery
very
much
and
this
beer
is
up
in
the
ranks
this
beer
has
a
heavier
taste
to
it
but
over
all
tastes
good
carbonation
is
high
but
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
its
easy
drinking
d
a
decent
brew
with
a
nice
sweetness
not
really
that
much
going
on
though
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
small
frothy
light
brown
head
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
malts
a
touch
of
fruit
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
flavor
is
caramel
malts
more
fruitiness
a
little
buttery
and
grapefruitcitrus
hops
mouthfeel
is
fairly
carbonated
dry
and
a
solid
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
beer
and
well
balanced
d
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
definitely
not
groundbreaking
id
have
another
decent
beer
not
a
favorite
but
id
drink
it
again
id
like
to
try
it
at
another
establishment
from
a
different
tap
system
im
not
convinced
that
i
got
the
best
draw
d
very
drinkable
a
nice
party
beer
or
a
starter
for
moving
away
from
bmcs
d
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
the
herbal
medicine
taste
is
a
little
out
of
place
drinkability
legit
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
its
not
as
smooth
as
yuengling
lager
but
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
less
bitter
than
yuengling
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
it
isnt
terribly
inventive
nor
is
it
my
favorite
from
the
flying
dog
lineup
but
its
a
solid
lager
thats
worth
a
try
if
its
available
to
you
d
this
was
a
solid
amber
i
was
really
surprised
to
see
the
notes
of
hops
in
the
middle
of
this
beer
i
just
wish
there
was
more
of
them
a
decent
beer
to
try
and
i
would
have
again
on
tap
i
would
buy
again
and
i
bet
it
is
great
on
tap
very
thin
mouthfeel
but
a
high
drinkability
make
this
a
beer
to
grab
but
not
to
search
out
a
very
good
beer
would
defintely
drink
again
serving
type
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
decent
head
retention
lacing
was
pretty
good
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
first
impression
was
very
sweet
and
malty
as
well
as
some
nuttiness
not
my
favorite
characteristics
but
this
beer
did
pull
them
off
well
the
smell
was
also
sweet
and
very
well
balanced
i
prefer
a
little
bit
more
bitterness
in
my
beers
but
this
is
a
respectable
amber
lager
ill
drink
this
again
if
i
buy
the
flying
dog
mix
pack
again
d
definately
a
drinkable
amber
i
do
find
the
roasted
and
maple
flavors
enjoyable
certainly
a
solid
specimen
of
the
style
memorable
kind
of
notes
another
just
fine
beer
from
flying
dog
a
solid
if
unadventurous
brewery
the
shocker
of
the
bunch
drinkability
meh
not
that
impressive
the
flying
dog
mixed
pack
has
been
incredibly
disappointing
it
is
definitely
not
worth
the
price
charged
for
it
id
take
a
sam
adams
mixed
pack
over
this
stuff
any
day
served
from
a
bottle
into
a
carta
blanca
pint
glass
dont
judge
me
beer
is
amber
in
color
shocking
they
nailed
the
color
the
head
was
big
at
first
but
fell
away
and
remained
about
18
of
an
inch
all
over
the
top
once
i
started
drinking
it
reduced
further
and
was
diffuse
smell
not
impressed
there
is
a
smell
but
its
like
an
odd
smelling
lager
almost
an
ocktoberfest
but
its
a
miss
taste
can
taste
some
diacetyl
but
its
ok
i
should
say
that
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
here
and
ill
leave
it
at
that
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
drinkability
is
fine
could
probably
put
this
away
in
short
order
but
theres
no
rush
flying
dog
may
be
growing
on
me
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
nothing
terribly
outstanding
about
it
probably
a
good
starting
point
for
beer
noobs
but
the
more
refined
palate
wont
find
anything
remarkable
about
this
one
a
beer
thats
very
drinkable
but
offers
very
little
in
terms
of
substance
i
hope
the
rest
of
the
flying
dog
mixpack
is
better
amber
lager
pours
a
golden
brown
with
a
moderate
amount
of
head
formation
that
idles
briefly
at
first
smell
the
nose
picks
up
scents
of
toast
and
malt
on
the
tongue
there
is
some
malt
sweetness
that
is
slightly
balanced
by
some
hops
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
that
of
silky
carbonation
and
aftertaste
fades
quickly
would
be
more
drinkable
if
it
had
more
of
a
crisp
taste
on
the
palate
d
fairly
smooth
and
flavorful
something
not
quite
right
dont
know
this
woiuld
be
a
repeat
for
me
d
wonder
where
it
went
one
of
the
best
beers
my
mother
picked
out
for
me
worth
a
try
drinkability
eh
its
okay
its
weak
and
bitter
without
any
complimentary
malts
or
flavors
to
balance
it
out
allinall
its
not
that
great
only
has
5
5
abv
and
just
doesnt
really
stand
out
unless
you
like
straightup
bitter
overall
for
a
lager
its
too
watery
it
could
use
some
more
complexity
for
the
sake
of
purpose
instead
of
just
throwing
a
bunch
of
ingredients
in
to
say
they
are
there
i
dont
like
my
review
even
as
i
do
a
spell
check
on
it
i
am
going
to
reserve
my
right
for
a
do
over
on
this
one
at
the
first
opportunity
poured
a
crystal
clear
orangeamber
with
a
modest
head
that
reduced
quickly
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
malty
sweet
the
taste
was
sweetsour
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
pours
a
light
redamber
color
with
just
a
bit
of
head
and
no
lacing
nice
sweet
malty
scent
with
a
little
hint
of
tartness
good
malty
taste
a
nice
deep
draught
with
a
bit
of
heaviness
to
it
from
the
specialty
maltsgrains
goes
down
very
well
with
just
a
hint
of
lager
tartness
at
the
ned
this
poured
a
nice
carbonated
amberorange
with
a
head
that
laced
well
the
smell
was
a
balanced
mixture
of
sweet
maltiness
and
floral
hops
a
little
toffee
and
caramel
in
there
too
the
taste
surpassed
the
nose
by
a
mile
definitely
a
hearty
balance
of
carameltoffeeroasted
malt
against
a
hop
backdrop
very
good
for
a
lager
i
find
that
we
beergeeks
are
quick
to
judge
all
beers
based
on
more
complexsmelling
and
tasting
styles
but
we
shouldnt
forget
to
judge
lagers
against
other
lagers
this
is
a
good
example
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
mediumbodied
with
decent
carbonation
and
i
think
that
this
combined
with
the
surprising
flavor
make
it
a
very
good
session
beer
verdict
old
scratch
is
simply
decent
at
best
and
ends
up
being
totally
unable
to
hold
my
attention
its
not
that
it
is
a
badtasting
beer
it
just
fails
in
offering
anything
worth
coming
back
for
overall
a
good
beer
i
really
think
i
need
to
get
a
fresh
one
everyone
raves
about
flying
dog
so
maybe
i
should
try
a
different
bottle
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
decent
head
the
flavor
is
light
caramel
and
fruity
but
not
citrusy
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
and
almost
tastes
like
butter
perhaps
more
like
butterscotch
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
very
good
allday
beer
im
not
blown
away
by
it
but
i
do
like
it
and
would
certainly
get
it
again
overall
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
lager
with
some
complexity
lots
of
malt
flavor
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
add
some
balance
its
not
as
smooth
as
yuengling
lager
but
a
nice
alternative
for
those
looking
to
take
a
swim
in
the
craft
beer
pool
d
put
it
this
way
if
amberbock
or
yinglying
tasted
this
good
sales
would
be
on
the
incline
overall
this
is
barely
one
step
above
a
macro
i
didnt
care
for
this
at
all
if
i
am
looking
for
a
session
beer
old
scratch
will
be
high
on
my
list
d
an
ok
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
it
could
really
use
more
flavors
and
complexity
as
for
now
it
comes
out
a
bit
thin
but
still
its
quite
refreshing
light
amber
color
with
a
white
head
mild
hops
and
roasted
toffee
smell
taste
contains
chestnut
which
is
grainy
and
earthy
but
also
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
to
it
imparted
from
kiwi
and
cherry
tastes
very
watery
slightly
bitter
and
seems
like
a
wannabe
ipa
but
again
too
thin
in
character
to
be
hoisted
as
a
red
lager
finish
is
unexceptional
a
bit
crisp
and
salty
pours
a
orange
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
gives
way
quickly
there
is
no
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
all
malt
the
smell
isnt
overpowering
it
is
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
is
the
same
it
is
a
little
weaker
than
i
was
expecting
the
taste
is
of
malt
and
caramel
notes
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
it
is
a
medium
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
very
average
beer
there
is
some
complexity
to
it
you
could
have
a
couple
of
them
but
not
a
lot
d
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
with
excellent
drinkability
the
malt
character
is
interesting
and
certainly
worth
a
try
nothing
spectacular
just
a
very
enjoyable
beer
clear
beautiful
dark
amber
color
head
fizzles
down
to
nothing
fast
leaving
behind
no
trace
of
lace
smells
malty
with
a
good
pinch
of
booze
to
wake
up
the
senses
good
malt
flavor
blended
nicely
smooth
feel
across
the
pallet
one
of
the
better
beers
of
theirs
that
ive
had
cheers
the
brew
makes
for
a
great
bbq
beer
not
too
thin
and
slightly
complex
decent
atmosphere
appearance
leaves
alot
to
the
imagination
but
the
nose
makes
up
for
it
a
bit
really
pleasing
with
a
nice
combination
of
components
full
flavor
good
balance
of
light
bitterness
and
subtle
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
quaff
d
these
could
be
had
one
after
another
easy
enough
definitely
better
than
your
average
beer
straightforward
and
refreshing
d
thats
one
tasty
amber
lager
thats
balanced
well
and
is
mellow
enough
to
be
enjoyed
one
after
another
certainly
pours
with
a
light
head
as
an
ipa
fan
i
was
supprised
by
the
flavor
and
lightness
of
the
beer
the
color
is
tanish
with
no
unfiltered
material
the
taste
is
well
ballanced
not
too
bitter
yet
not
too
flat
over
all
a
good
lager
even
for
those
who
do
not
particularly
like
lagers
i
especially
enjoy
the
twelve
pack
mix
that
i
purchaced
it
in
drinkabilty
this
is
definitely
something
i
could
drink
again
it
worked
well
for
me
on
a
warm
day
and
i
feel
it
would
work
well
in
the
cold
winter
as
well
pours
a
nice
amber
color
very
clear
with
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
lively
carbonation
smells
slightly
of
malt
no
lacing
smooth
on
the
palate
light
and
clear
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
medium
finish
not
a
lot
of
character
to
set
it
apart
but
an
easy
to
drink
amber
beer
with
a
good
flavor
cheers
d
these
would
go
down
okay
on
a
hot
day
so
far
this
is
the
back
of
the
pack
of
all
the
flying
dogs
ive
tried
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wont
buy
it
unless
it
happens
to
be
in
a
mix
pack
again
d
to
me
this
is
just
average
nothing
really
sticks
out
in
the
flavors
or
aroma
and
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
disappointing
overall
not
my
favorite
in
any
way
from
flying
dog
d
another
pretty
average
beer
from
a
pretty
average
brewery
theres
nothing
at
all
here
to
separate
this
from
the
overcrowded
pack
of
amber
lagers
not
bad
but
just
blah
drinkability
great
session
beer
not
overly
impressed
only
had
a
few
beers
in
this
style
and
much
prefer
the
brooklyn
lager
to
this
version
d
very
high
tastes
great
i
dont
understand
the
low
rating
for
the
style
quite
nice
overall
second
time
in
a
row
that
im
not
impress
with
flying
dog
beer
this
one
does
not
stand
out
of
most
regular
amber
lager
i
believe
it
is
half
decent
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
a
slight
dissapointment
from
what
i
feel
is
a
great
brewery
d
drinkable
probably
pick
up
a
sixpack
here
and
there
i
tend
to
stray
from
fusion
beers
except
dogfish
heads
they
seem
to
always
get
them
right
and
this
is
not
an
exception
a
lager
with
an
amber
flavor
i
do
not
have
the
greatest
palate
so
i
have
a
hard
time
explaining
it
but
the
refined
flavor
of
a
lager
does
not
mix
with
the
amber
beer
flavor
sometimes
i
think
that
flying
dog
gets
away
with
mediocre
beer
because
of
their
porter
and
their
artwork
who
is
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
mouthfeel
is
antiquated
the
malts
taste
old
and
the
hops
are
slightly
stale
on
the
palate
both
contribute
to
a
dry
finish
even
though
the
beer
is
smooth
and
mild
bodied
at
the
start
i
could
drink
more
of
this
but
im
not
really
inclined
to
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
good
in
a
pinch
ill
give
it
refreshing
but
not
desirable
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
unless
i
was
invited
to
an
amber
lager
party
and
was
assigned
this
beer
to
bring
creamy
and
slow
on
the
tongue
this
is
an
incredible
lager
chocked
full
of
malty
goodness
and
with
ample
amounts
of
hops
full
of
flavor
and
of
high
quality
up
there
with
the
best
d
respectable
offering
from
flying
dog
though
not
my
favorite
by
far
medium
amber
in
color
with
active
prickle
in
the
glass
and
a
higher
than
average
concentration
of
bubbles
from
the
carbonation
there
is
little
to
no
head
even
right
after
being
poured
i
guess
the
carbonation
and
volatility
is
in
all
of
those
bubbles
the
nose
has
an
understated
malt
quality
to
it
maybe
some
gentle
caramel
notes
the
attack
is
mild
with
a
pleasant
and
smooth
malt
flavor
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
gentle
flavors
of
caramel
blended
with
some
coffee
flavor
that
give
a
net
result
of
smokiness
the
finish
is
very
clean
so
all
of
the
tasting
happens
with
it
in
your
mouth
the
color
is
a
brownish
color
with
some
red
hues
with
a
very
little
beige
foam
head
that
dissapated
immediatley
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
no
hops
flavor
was
slightly
sweet
caramel
apple
coating
sweet
malt
with
almost
no
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
body
was
low
to
medium
better
than
a
flat
tire
but
not
by
too
much
overall
this
beer
is
slightly
above
average
and
i
would
try
it
again
but
it
would
not
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
its
also
a
light
and
smooth
drink
d
doesnt
quite
fit
the
style
for
me
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
super
special
about
it
do
not
want
notes
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
here
and
i
just
felt
it
was
pretty
boring
all
in
all
it
was
still
o
k
pours
a
nice
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
white
head
that
does
not
stick
around
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
hints
of
banana
and
butterscotch
crisp
flavor
is
mainly
malty
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
an
undertone
of
banana
texture
is
smooth
fizzy
and
jazzy
a
good
choice
poured
from
the
bottle
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
smaller
slightly
off
white
head
that
dies
off
rather
quickly
a
reasonable
aroma
with
hints
of
light
hop
and
malt
taste
is
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
hints
of
malt
caramel
and
a
bit
of
hops
as
well
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
complexity
a
clean
rather
crisp
finish
overall
quite
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
medium
tan
head
smell
is
somewhat
rusty
not
too
hot
taste
is
quite
a
bit
better
toasted
grain
a
hint
of
diacytal
and
a
very
earthy
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
smooth
somewhat
rough
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
though
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
all
in
all
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
very
solid
sessionable
beer
to
relax
with
and
enjoy
a
ball
game
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
like
i
said
above
nothing
harsh
easy
on
the
mouth
at
5
3
abv
and
not
a
really
strong
flavor
i
could
drink
multiple
of
these
in
a
given
session
because
this
is
not
really
robust
or
rich
flavored
i
would
use
this
as
a
utility
beer
kind
of
unusual
for
a
lager
but
serves
the
purpose
to
a
tee
a
sixpack
is
around
35
aud
so
i
wont
be
taking
it
to
too
many
bbqs
but
thats
not
to
say
i
wouldnt
like
to
d
i
would
like
this
beer
in
the
autum
it
reminded
me
of
a
new
england
fall
yuengling
is
the
better
amber
lager
nice
amber
color
caramel
malty
smell
with
pretty
good
head
and
decent
ringer
good
looking
beer
good
smell
taste
is
clean
and
malty
not
exceptionally
great
but
still
a
very
good
beer
easy
to
drink
and
easy
mouthfeel
is
decent
clean
and
malty
with
pretty
good
aftertaste
malty
all
the
way
very
little
hops
but
just
enough
and
smooth
the
appearance
is
really
good
great
copper
color
with
thick
lacey
head
ummmm
looks
tasty
smells
of
malt
and
hops
dry
smooth
taste
with
hoppy
deep
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
this
is
a
good
lager
purchased
after
a
recommendation
from
our
local
liquor
owner
d
very
high
the
light
body
and
flavors
would
make
this
a
great
session
beer
over
all
its
an
good
yet
average
beer
12
oz
bottle
cloudy
amber
pour
no
real
head
to
speak
of
malt
and
quite
a
bit
of
floral
hop
characteristics
a
bit
of
a
dry
bitter
finish
for
an
amber
not
bad
im
just
not
sure
it
fits
with
the
style
i
think
the
things
that
make
their
high
gravity
beers
excellent
might
be
working
against
them
in
this
not
to
say
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
though
pours
amber
obviously
got
about
a
1
finger
head
out
of
it
can
smell
the
malts
in
this
one
also
some
citrusy
smell
tastes
pretty
good
to
me
taste
a
bit
of
that
citrus
also
getting
good
malt
taste
with
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
end
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
but
nothing
overwhelming
about
it
its
not
that
memorable
d
no
thanks
decent
drinkability
i
liked
the
beer
though
not
sure
id
reup
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
is
one
that
i
will
keep
regularly
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
i
wasnt
expecting
much
of
anything
from
this
beer
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
seeing
as
my
review
is
so
much
lower
than
the
average
i
imagine
maybe
i
just
got
an
old
bottle
i
may
have
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
but
i
dont
know
if
id
get
around
to
it
with
so
many
other
good
brews
floating
around
out
there
this
brew
pours
up
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
big
ol
off
white
head
pretty
nice
lacing
too
i
smell
sweet
malts
faint
hops
in
the
finish
smells
like
a
sweaty
day
in
the
mid
summer
i
taste
basically
the
same
as
the
nose
sweet
malts
faint
hops
caramel
and
a
whole
lotta
love
medium
bodied
low
smoothe
carbo
a
great
sessionable
beer
p
s
this
was
judged
as
a
cali
common
which
leads
me
to
ask
why
its
not
classified
as
that
here
overall
a
pretty
standard
amber
lager
i
might
consider
this
to
be
slightly
better
than
other
amber
lagers
i
have
had
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beverage
i
was
not
really
impressed
with
the
apperance
or
smell
what
lacks
in
smell
and
apperance
is
brought
up
in
taste
and
mouth
feel
i
think
it
has
a
very
light
crisp
taste
and
very
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
is
very
refreshing
on
the
way
down
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
this
was
an
ok
beer
it
was
amber
in
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
not
much
aroma
just
a
little
bit
of
caramel
malt
the
malt
came
through
a
little
more
in
the
taste
but
was
still
understated
little
bit
of
hop
finish
i
had
a
couple
of
these
and
wouldnt
want
any
more
old
scratch
had
a
beautiful
ambertolightcaramel
color
upon
pouring
the
aroma
presented
bisquity
but
had
not
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
flavor
this
amber
lager
had
a
smooth
kind
of
heavy
mouthfeel
overall
not
too
impressed
by
this
one
and
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
d
an
ok
lager
simple
fairly
approachable
but
pretty
ordinary
if
youre
looking
for
a
simple
lager
you
could
do
better
overall
an
excellent
lager
i
wish
it
were
a
little
more
easy
to
find
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
as
a
regular
option
at
restaurants
and
bars
good
drinkability
very
smooth
good
taste
but
i
prefer
a
lager
with
a
bit
more
body
overall
good
and
worth
a
try
pretty
much
what
i
expected
bit
of
mild
hop
aroma
little
flavor
but
a
nice
upfront
clean
bitterness
lends
a
nice
crispness
to
the
brew
along
with
the
carbonation
being
a
little
overdone
not
the
best
brew
for
a
cold
winter
day
but
some
where
sunny
and
warm
and
this
would
be
a
perfect
brew
d
drinkable
beer
not
too
bitter
nice
flavor
good
beer
to
try
but
dont
overindulge
it
fills
you
up
for
a
lager
poured
a
dark
honey
color
with
a
fleeting
head
leaving
a
very
thin
line
with
little
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
malts
and
a
slight
hoppy
floralness
with
a
bit
of
a
musty
quality
the
flavor
is
malty
up
front
not
unlike
a
malt
liquor
with
little
else
going
on
aside
from
a
slight
sweetness
light
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
d
very
good
not
a
terribly
complex
beer
but
an
easydrinking
lager
with
some
flavor
and
balance
pours
a
clear
amber
color
good
12
inch
head
but
poor
retention
and
little
to
no
lacing
smells
of
hops
and
a
strong
lager
smell
there
is
also
only
a
hint
of
malt
aroma
fits
the
style
pretty
well
smooth
crisp
average
carbonation
and
there
it
imparts
a
dry
quality
on
the
tongue
hops
are
noticeable
up
front
but
quickly
disappear
there
is
a
slight
malt
background
but
mostly
the
lager
flavor
is
dominant
overall
a
little
weak
and
a
little
to
high
of
carbonation
but
otherwise
a
good
beer
nikki

will
buy
again
pours
a
very
nice
neon
red
very
nice
a
bit
of
aroma
not
too
much
but
some
caramel
malt
in
there
tastes
waaay
too
dry
for
me
to
enjoy
there
are
some
decent
hops
and
some
maple
syrup
and
caramel
but
this
is
just
way
too
dry
to
work
with
those
flavors
wont
buy
this
again
overall
a
great
beer
to
wind
down
with
after
a
day
at
work
not
heavy
but
not
too
light
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
flying
dog
in
the
near
future
partially
through
the
beer
and
most
of
the
citrus
takes
over
but
it
remains
on
the
lighter
side
the
only
thing
im
not
totally
digging
is
the
bitterness
afterward
overall
the
brew
is
good
but
a
little
on
the
plain
side
the
drinkability
is
high
this
been
goes
down
very
easily
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
good
beer
i
happen
to
enjoy
this
one
it
has
a
small
hint
of
citrus
in
it
overall
it
was
a
little
more
bitter
than
what
i
like
in
an
amber
i
happen
to
like
ambers
almost
as
much
as
i
like
the
good
ol
fashion
white
beers
i
would
try
the
other
flying
dog
beers
i
tend
to
like
these
as
much
drinkability
is
so
so
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
beer
finish
is
merely
nonexistent
d
good
drinkability
due
to
the
lightness
it
has
medium
yellow
amber
body
there
is
a
good
lace
and
offwhite
head
both
have
average
staying
power
the
aroma
has
variety
sweet
fruity
malt
and
hops
tones
and
maybe
a
little
roasted
caramel
the
smell
kind
of
fooled
me
the
flavor
is
more
bitter
than
the
smell
but
that
was
good
because
it
made
it
more
balanced
of
citric
and
sweet
it
is
almost
medium
bodied
and
has
some
fizz
bite
cheers
dhigh
drinkability
due
to
ease
of
consumption
its
light
flavor
and
nonassertive
bitterness
keeps
this
one
light
and
refreshing
would
be
a
good
session
beer
for
a
longer
session
this
beer
pours
a
amber
color
with
red
notes
adn
an
off
white
head
that
promises
to
fade
to
lacing
the
aroma
presents
a
lot
of
caramel
and
other
maltiness
the
taste
presents
a
nice
amount
of
roasted
malt
and
lager
taste
with
a
medium
hop
finish
good
co2
and
a
medium
bodymake
this
a
drinkable
beer
a
nice
lager
with
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
from
it
this
would
make
a
good
sessionbeer
worth
a
try
kind
of
disappointing
in
the
taste
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
up
front
but
it
kind
of
subsides
into
grainy
watery
confusion
there
is
some
late
bitterness
and
plenty
of
carbonation
but
this
isnt
really
what
i
expect
from
an
amber
lager
at
all
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
near
perfect
bitterness
is
well
balanced
throughout
the
mouth
very
pleasant
overall
taste
drinkable
enough
but
there
is
definately
better
beer
to
try
although
this
is
no
dissapointment
the
color
when
poured
was
had
a
reddish
hue
ot
this
medium
dark
amber
with
very
little
foam
that
disapated
immediatley
the
smell
of
mild
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
candy
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
but
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
butterschoch
was
to
bitter
for
my
taste
a
very
good
ale
made
unpleasant
because
of
an
over
powering
bitter
feel
in
the
mouth
and
palate
not
what
i
expected
for
this
amber
ale
dog
drinkability
sweet
and
bitter
in
balance
and
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
the
best
one
of
the
flying
dog
mixed
pack
it
pours
a
beautiful
deep
red
color
and
has
a
very
thick
body
for
the
style
which
makes
for
a
great
mouthfeel
tastes
of
caramel
malts
and
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
damn
good
one
and
i
would
try
it
again
for
sure
d
once
is
enough
amber
lagers
arent
my
thing
drinkability
wouldnt
pass
one
up
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
one
either
all
in
all
a
very
solid
complex
and
drinkable
amber
lager
i
dug
it
bham
uk
sept
2008
one
of
the
better
flying
dog
varieties
beautiful
medium
amber
color
soft
carbonation
and
decent
head
with
nice
lacing
all
malt
in
the
nose
taste
is
the
same
smooth
caramel
malt
with
a
hops
bitterness
that
borders
on
a
bit
too
bitter
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
from
the
aftertaste
nothing
special
about
this
one
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
stuck
out
i
just
poured
it
drank
it
and
moved
on
to
the
next
flying
dog
decent
malts
not
to
much
spice
smooth
beer
there
are
better
ones
out
there
so
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
d
very
good
lager
not
to
over
powering
very
drinkable
d
too
sweet
to
session
for
me
but
some
folks
might
like
it
a
nice
lager
with
nice
flavor
and
a
hop
presence
very
enjoyable
pours
a
four
finger
slight
cream
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
nice
clear
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
maltyhoppy
nose
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
and
stays
that
way
especially
as
it
starts
to
warm
but
not
overly
malty
there
are
enough
hops
for
a
good
balance
1
67
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capital
convenience
concord
nh
d
entirely
drinkable
lager
with
ale
characteristics
doesnt
go
over
the
top
or
push
any
envelopes
it
stays
in
a
safe
zone
and
just
does
its
thang
solid
beer
that
is
drinkable
and
flavorful
like
many
flying
dog
ales
overall
its
a
decent
beer
that
goes
down
easily
but
doesnt
do
much
to
impress
in
the
flavor
department
maybe
a
good
starter
beer
to
wean
your
friends
off
bmc
for
me
one
and
done
too
many
other
good
beers
out
there
md
lightly
effervescent
on
the
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
slightly
on
the
thinish
side
but
quite
easydrinking
this
socalled
american
amber
lager
tastes
not
bad
but
surely
in
need
of
a
clearer
character
or
a
more
pronounced
profile
to
make
it
shine
at
the
moment
its
like
a
sweeter
and
less
hoppy
cross
bw
vienna
lager
and
a
fruity
english
best
bitter
overall
an
enjoyable
easily
drinkable
lager
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
well
balanced
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
refreshing
beer
the
sweetness
make
it
more
of
a
one
and
done
mouthfeel
is
high
on
carbonation
thin
on
the
palate
and
easy
to
drink
unfortunately
it
just
isnt
very
flavorful
poured
a
clear
amber
and
topped
off
by
a
two
finger
frothy
tan
head
retention
is
good
and
a
craggy
lacing
is
left
behind
smells
grainy
and
malty
with
some
sweet
tea
and
lemon
in
the
background
tastes
sweet
and
sugary
but
not
at
all
cloying
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
is
medium
this
brew
keeps
its
drinkability
while
still
being
interesting
and
tasty
d
sweet
and
bitter
in
balance
and
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
was
a
better
beer
then
i
expected
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
d
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
a
nice
combination
of
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
a
smooth
robust
malt
taste
definitely
an
excellent
summer
brew
this
brewery
puts
out
some
pretty
decent
beers
its
not
my
overall
favorite
but
i
do
enjoy
this
amber
and
am
looking
forward
to
my
twelve
pack
sampler
reviewed
on
my
phone
this
is
a
good
representative
of
how
i
like
my
ambers
great
job
by
the
flying
dog
boys
id
get
this
again
d
probably
fairly
drinkable
even
in
quantity
if
its
being
poured
or
served
worth
the
try
probably
great
with
most
meals
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
if
you
have
to
drink
it
its
not
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
but
i
wouldnt
choose
to
drink
it
again
hv
malty
crisp
sweet
aromas
and
a
handshake
of
hops
to
balance
flavor
walks
a
tightrope
suspended
above
the
safe
zone
clean
pipes
of
sweet
grain
and
a
time
reminiscent
of
gold
prospectors
drinking
with
san
francisco
transvestite
gold
diggers
not
bad
from
the
half
ass
boys
i
think
i
like
it
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
small
foamy
head
on
a
light
amber
body
sweet
caramel
dominated
the
smell
and
the
taste
with
coffee
coming
through
in
the
taste
as
well
also
a
dustiness
that
wasnt
so
nice
medium
bitterness
was
nice
and
its
medium
carbonation
was
nice
as
well
okay
nothing
too
special
or
remarkable
but
that
dustiness
didnt
help
something
about
this
beer
i
just
dont
find
very
drinkable
little
head
but
nice
color
rich
amber
but
minimal
lacing
decent
scents
of
sweet
malt
and
slight
carmel
are
the
most
abundant
smells
that
i
smell
good
malty
sweet
flavor
but
nothing
too
extraordinary
nice
body
and
its
a
good
sipping
beer
better
than
average
but
not
awesome
d
a
decent
amber
lager
worthy
of
a
try
as
i
poured
the
old
scratch
into
my
pint
glass
i
wasnt
surprised
at
what
i
saw
a
clean
molassescolored
brew
with
a
mild
head
light
carbonation
rests
on
the
tongue
instead
of
attacking
it
but
the
flavorful
brew
my
tastebuds
were
waiting
for
did
not
come
an
aftertaste
richer
than
the
initial
is
what
followed
there
are
subtle
notes
of
deep
mohagany
that
go
over
well
but
they
hide
in
the
background
a
little
too
much
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
amber
lager
but
sacrifices
flavor
too
much
for
my
liking
this
dog
needs
a
kick
in
the
ass
to
make
it
fly
d
not
a
bad
beer
just
kind
of
boring
overall
and
the
flavour
isnt
great
much
rather
have
a
sam
adams
d
i
just
dont
care
for
it
not
one
i
would
try
again
this
is
a
pretty
bland
beer
overall
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
really
and
while
it
is
drinkable
i
dont
think
id
revisit
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
overall
not
bad
pours
a
clean
amber
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
small
sweet
maltiness
in
the
taste
malty
sweet
and
somewhat
skunky
a
small
bite
and
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
malty
aftertaste
kind
of
skunky
taste
malty
and
dry
really
not
that
good
d
i
was
impressed
with
this
amber
full
flavor
and
smooth
mouthfeel
definitely
a
sessionable
lager
pours
a
one
finger
head
with
that
recedes
to
a
small
thin
island
of
foam
in
the
middle
tecolor
is
a
nicecarml
copper
with
some
light
lazy
bubbling
the
aroma
has
some
caramel
light
orange
sauce
witha
hint
of
mint
hops
these
scent
are
pretty
hard
to
detect
though
the
taste
is
a
fruity
carmel
with
a
toasted
malt
finish
mixed
with
some
light
spruce
hop
notes
the
palate
is
a
light
sweet
fruit
mixed
with
earthy
hops
with
a
bit
of
carameled
hops
pours
a
rich
amber
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
lightly
hopped
with
a
touch
of
sulfur
and
some
caramel
taste
is
malty
but
not
overbearing
mostly
caramel
flavors
with
a
faint
amount
of
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
creamier
than
expected
and
mediumbodied
easy
to
drink
like
a
god
lager
should
be
overall
a
good
standard
everyday
type
of
beer
probably
a
very
pleasant
drink
for
a
calm
evening
its
a
nice
ambe
colored
brew
with
a
smallish
quickly
receiding
head
smells
of
toasted
and
sweet
malts
with
hints
of
floral
hops
taste
is
mainly
toasted
malts
upfront
and
throughout
with
some
sweet
hints
and
a
little
hop
hit
in
the
rear
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
but
isnt
overly
drinkable
because
of
the
lack
of
overall
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldt
seek
it
out
a
pretty
decent
drinking
lager
from
flying
dog
but
not
a
standout
by
any
means
overall
a
decent
beer
not
a
great
beer
but
a
good
lager
enough
flavor
to
make
it
interesting
light
enough
to
make
it
drinkable
malt
flavors
mostly
but
nice
and
clean
sweet
at
first
with
pale
ale
richness
then
a
little
tart
with
a
nice
toasty
malt
syrup
then
nutty
dry
and
biscuity
even
with
a
slight
astringency
supremely
smooth
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
d
because
nothing
is
too
overwhelming
and
it
has
a
nice
light
flavor
it
is
a
nice
session
beer
old
scratch
is
a
decent
lager
of
clear
orangeycopper
color
with
a
modest
lid
of
fine
offwhite
fuzz
it
brings
some
very
light
sweet
caramel
and
apricots
to
the
table
along
with
a
more
pronounced
toasted
biscuit
and
spicy
hop
character
its
pretty
light
and
watery
with
a
modest
fizzy
carbonation
this
completes
my
flying
dog
sampler
and
this
one
like
most
of
the
others
is
a
decent
beer
with
good
drinkability
and
some
flavor
better
than
macro
stuff
but
nothing
amazing
im
thinking
the
canis
major
sampler
i
just
bought
will
impress
me
more
though
this
is
not
a
beer
that
will
blow
you
over
i
think
its
very
drinkable
and
i
would
gladly
have
a
few
more
last
one
from
the
sample
pack
an
ok
appearance
some
patchy
lacing
over
a
typically
delicious
amberred
color
look
the
aromas
were
a
bit
weak
had
little
roasty
aromas
with
a
general
floral
smell
the
taste
has
a
good
sweetness
to
it
a
bit
of
honey
with
caramel
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
a
good
strong
point
pretty
crisp
and
carbonated
overall
a
decent
red
lager
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
because
i
was
expecting
a
lager
and
got
something
with
more
ale
qualities
in
my
judgement
id
like
to
know
the
yeast
strain
and
temp
md
sweet
at
the
back
nice
and
refreshing
was
happy
to
see
this
wasnt
a
drain
pour
like
their
tire
bite
i
just
tasted
d
decently
drinkable
but
it
really
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
to
hold
up
well
enough
to
be
enjoyable
longterm
still
a
decent
beer
though
drinkability
goes
down
very
smooth
and
refreshes
the
palate
dits
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
something
that
i
would
reach
for
very
often
as
it
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
for
me
i
have
had
much
better
ambers
d
smooth
hoppiness
nice
balance
and
a
good
malty
sweetness
provides
for
a
smooth
drink
i
would
like
to
have
this
on
draft
may
be
better
d
4
5
might
seem
high
but
this
is
extremely
drinkable
its
not
too
heavy
not
too
belchinducing
and
not
bitter
all
this
alone
makes
a
good
session
beer
but
the
wonderful
simplicity
of
flavor
is
what
pushes
this
into
a
great
session
beer
im
trying
this
via
a
flying
dog
mix
pack
but
i
could
definitely
see
myself
buying
a
sixer
of
this
for
a
night
with
friends
drinkability
wow
flying
dog
has
been
impressing
me
so
far
another
session
quality
beer
pours
a
clear
lightmed
copper
color
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
down
my
nonic
a
decent
smell
a
steely
grain
and
toasty
caramel
smells
a
bit
raisony
and
metallic
a
crisp
and
robust
deep
malt
flavor
a
bit
minerally
but
blends
well
with
darker
fruits
and
a
clean
finish
dry
and
light
but
w
some
residual
sweetness
and
decent
co2
make
this
a
very
creamy
feeling
brew
tho
wow
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
a
few
cases
of
this
a
little
too
much
like
a
weakkneed
malt
liquor
drinkable
but
not
particularly
memorable
di
think
i
had
four
or
five
pints
and
i
enjoyed
every
single
one
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
with
a
little
bite
this
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
this
summer
d
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
about
average
it
seemed
a
little
dry
and
a
bit
light
in
character
but
overall
wasnt
too
bad
i
dont
know
that
i
would
go
seeking
this
one
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
over
all
a
decent
brew
however
i
dont
think
that
ill
be
seeking
this
out
on
a
regular
basis
especially
when
i
consider
the
quality
of
this
the
difficulty
of
finding
it
in
my
area
in
contrast
to
its
overall
flavor
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
haf
inch
off
white
head
smells
of
caramel
and
malts
has
an
interesting
sweet
and
sour
taste
to
it
the
malts
and
caramel
dominating
the
mouth
with
a
slight
hoppy
after
taste
not
a
bad
aftereffect
in
the
mouth
though
it
leaves
the
palate
a
little
dry
definately
a
drinkable
beer
i
wish
id
bought
more
than
just
one
probably
the
plainest
beer
you
will
find
from
flying
dog
its
a
great
session
ale
with
its
mild
abv
and
smoot
characteristics
recommended
d
nice
session
beer
not
too
complicated
but
enough
to
satisfy
a
good
inclusion
in
the
mixed
12
packs
drinkability
the
initial
flavor
isnt
bad
but
the
sourness
and
bitterness
turn
this
into
an
unappealing
chore
to
drink
the
feeling
that
it
leaves
in
the
mouth
and
the
throat
isnt
a
good
thing
and
the
flavor
of
it
makes
it
sit
heavy
in
the
stomach
its
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
by
a
long
shot
but
i
expected
more
from
it
very
good
drinkability
seems
like
a
good
darker
beer
to
drink
in
the
warmer
months
flavorful
but
light
enough
for
a
session
drinkability
if
youre
in
the
desert
and
you
come
upon
an
oasis
with
a
running
refridgerator
bear
with
me
here
and
it
was
stocked
with
nothing
but
ice
cold
flying
roach
beer
id
choose
death
the
rest
of
these
beers
in
my
fridge
will
be
thrown
away
or
given
to
a
homless
person
on
the
street
what
can
i
say
body
is
mid
to
light
really
this
beer
was
pretty
bad
drinkability
there
is
none
maybe
they
threw
a
bunch
of
the
flying
roaches
in
while
brewing
i
usually
dont
like
to
judge
a
bottle
by
the
label
but
i
mean
come
on
get
your
act
together
and
slap
a
real
label
on
there
no
one
wants
a
flying
roach
on
the
bottle
fire
whoever
came
up
with
this
idea
one
of
flying
dogs
more
flavorful
brews
not
as
thin
as
most
i
was
a
bit
impressed
pours
pale
amber
with
a
malty
nose
tall
caramel
malts
attack
my
taste
buds
with
the
hops
jumping
up
and
down
in
the
back
a
bit
of
swishing
and
i
finally
see
them
and
order
them
to
the
front
for
a
decent
refreshing
finish
i
recommend
for
a
not
too
sugary
after
dinner
treat
d
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
decent
attempt
at
an
amber
lager
but
comes
up
a
bit
short
isnt
quite
clear
cut
or
defining
in
any
category
overall
this
was
a
mediumbodied
average
depiction
of
the
style
nothing
above
and
beyond
and
wouldnt
really
go
out
of
my
way
to
recommend
this
one
d
pretty
solid
take
on
the
american
amber
lager
drinkability
amber
ale
is
a
good
beer
quite
drinkable
and
crisp
my
first
flying
dog
beer
one
of
six
different
flying
dog
brews
i
bought
in
a
variety
pack
that
has
me
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
them
poured
into
my
pint
glass
and
received
a
seethru
but
dark
rubycopper
body
with
some
nice
head
and
a
little
lacing
i
didnt
notice
too
much
in
the
nose
area
except
a
mild
grainy
malt
smell
couldve
been
my
nose
not
the
beer
a
soft
roasted
flavor
that
is
mediumbodied
with
touches
of
caramel
and
even
some
fruit
went
down
very
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
list
hoppy
backbite
so
you
know
youre
drinking
a
beer
not
water
very
easy
on
the
palate
and
definitely
a
session
beer
pours
a
light
orangey
amber
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
and
excellent
clarity
aromas
are
full
of
biscuity
toasty
malts
theres
also
quite
a
bit
of
fruity
ester
notes
some
apple
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
hop
aroma
comes
across
as
grassy
and
almost
vegetal
ibu
far
lower
than
style
or
anchor
steam
on
the
palate
it
is
very
clean
with
more
lager
like
qualities
im
going
to
have
to
say
bjcp
miscatagorized
this
beer
hop
flavor
is
quite
prominent
and
bitterness
isnt
as
soft
as
id
expect
for
19
ibus
toasty
and
light
estery
flavors
continue
through
in
the
flavor
overall
a
really
nice
lager
a
bit
more
body
than
other
foreign
examples
d
quite
nice
i
liked
this
one
and
could
have
more
drinkability
a
solid
lager
well
worth
a
shot
give
this
one
a
try
buy
a
sixer
and
take
it
camping
or
something
good
not
great
but
good
poured
a

not

came
through
taste
is
well
bodied
with
some

i
had
to
go
clearish
copper
pour
with
a
little
beige
head
smell
at
first
is
very
metallic
but
it
subsides
after
resting
34
minutes
turns
into
a
caramelly
malty
light
yeast
smell
that
is
substantially
more
appealing
nice
smooth
creamy
malty
amber
flavor
not
too
full
bodied
of
a
mouthfeel
but
it
has
a
nice
flavor
this
was
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
have
again
but
didnt
really
strike
me
as
one
that
i
should
i
could
session
this
stuff
much
more
character
then
most
domestic
lagers
as
far
as
flavor
goes
a
very
straight
forward
as
advertised
kind
of
beer
not
spectacular
but
far
from
mediocre
the
astringency
in
the
beer
really
takes
away
from
the
overall
impression
drinkability
is
low
i
didnt
finish
this
one
because
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
and
lifes
too
short
dont
think
it
was
spoiled
or
anything
just
a
gross
taste
from
whatever
maltestershop
combo
they
picked
wouldnt
want
to
power
though
and
chug
this
one
either
instapuke
clean
tasting
and
the
hops
only
come
through
at
the
very
end
and
the
type
is
completely
indistinguishable
the
malt
is
fantastic
on
this
beer
rich
and
complex
old
scratch
had
a
very
low
hop
profile
perhaps
too
low
for
style
i
realize
that
an
amber
lager
is
suposed
to
have
a
low
hop
profile
but
this
one
is
a
bit
low
for
my
liking
this
is
very
malty
but
so
much
so
that
it
carries
a
very
sweet
flavor
profile
d
decent
and
worth
a
try
in
the
mix
pack
but
not
to
get
a
six
pack
probably
the
least
favorite
from
an
otherwise
pretty
good
selection
from
flying
dog
d
dont
like
it
at
all
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
doesnt
taste
at
all
overall
probably
my
least
favourite
flying
dog
beer
maybe
worth
a
try
once
instead
theyve
bottled
mediocrity
a
nicelooking
but
bland
beer
that
will
make
me
selective
when
considering
something
from
flying
dog
i
remember
a
couple
years
ago
i
asked
a
cashier
at
the
local
friar
tucks
what
he
thought
about
flying
dog
and
he
said
that
he
didnt
like
their
beer
but
didnt
elaborate
with
a
few
exceptions
im
not
enamored
with
their
wares
either
id
avoid
old
scratch
overall
dependable
beer
with
good
flavors
that
are
subtle
make
this
one
to
try
again
other
not
really
impressed
as
an
absense
of
hops
becomes
neccessary
to
balance
the
overly
malty
flavors
smell
is
malty
not
hoppy
taste
is
somewhat
smoker
with
hops
and
earthy
dry
finish
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
really
needs
some
sort
of
food
to
accompany
this
brew
my
old
notes
show
old
scratch
as
a
much
better
beer
i
am
not
sure
if
my
palate
has
evolved
or
if
flying
dog
has
taken
a
hit
anyway
another
good
gateway
beer
that
nobody
could
say
i
dont
like
dark
beers
taste
is
rather
mild
no
real
hops
on
the
palate
with
a
clean
maltiness
and
finish
only
a
lager
can
produce
this
american
amber
has
some
body
and
is
nicely
carbonated
a
good
crossover
session
beer
for
your
bmc
buddies
drinkability
decent
brew
but
lacks
the
qualities
that
could
help
this
beer
become
a
standout
overall
this
one
is
merely
okay
i
cant
say
i
am
really
blown
away
at
all
the
only
thing
that
set
this
score
higher
is
the
appearance
and
fragrance
of
it
other
than
that
it
would
be
quite
lower
taste
of
caramel
wood
and
nuts
the
beer
tastes
like
a
spiced
up
pilsner
with
added
caramel
malts
which
increase
body
and
taste
typical
bottom
fermented
beer
with
light
clean
taste
maybe
some
very
light
sulfur
hops
are
very
low
body
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
one
solid
brew
in
a
nice
line
by
flying
dog
pours
a
redcopper
color
with
a
nice
head
a
bit
sticky
nicely
done
smells
of
nutty
malts
and
some
hops
is
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
and
fairly
priced
nice
baseball
drinking
beer
that
is
crisp
smooth
and
refreshing
very
clear
and
deep
reddish
amber
this
one
produced
a
tin
offwhite
head
full
of
fine
bubbles
it
showed
good
head
retention
with
some
sticky
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
pretty
clean
balanced
towards
maltiness
with
a
very
mild
caramel
character
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
mild
bitterness
with
the
balance
in
favour
of
malty
sweetness
hops
were
floral
with
a
hint
of
citrus
caramel
came
forward
at
the
end
and
the
bitterness
really
popped
in
the
finish
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
fairly
crisp
solid
texture
very
easy
drinking
well
balanced
and
well
made
id
definitely
have
this
again
d
decent
but
nothing
exciting
i
was
tossing
up
whether
to
get
this
or
not
luckily
i
only
got
two
bottles
yes
i
could
enjoy
more
of
this
if
i
had
pours
a
rubyredamber
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
light
and
crisp
malty
and
much
like
an
amber
taste
is
malty
and
even
somewhat
smoky
somewhat
of
a
cross
between
a
scottish
ale
and
lager
mouthfeel
is
ok
if
not
somewhat
dullish
and
metallic
its
also
somewhat
overwhelmed
by
the
maltiness
of
this
beer
leaving
my
mouth
dry
while
it
gets
points
for
being
drinkable
the
dryness
is
kind
of
a
letdown
here
whats
odd
is
the
name
doesnt
quite
match
the
style
california
commonsteam
beer
and
thats
probably
why
im
confused
on
style
it
is
well
balanced
fruity
lager
with
a
nice
refreshing
mouthfeel
it
is
not
overpowering
and
could
easily
appeal
to
a
mainstream
market
if
the
price
was
a
bit
cheaper
not
bad
and
i
am
glad
i
only
bought
a
couple
of
bottles
good
for
a
try
but
not
something
i
would
buy
more
of
if
readily
available
in
australia
d
i
do
not
plan
to
try
this
again
but
it
was
not
offensive
such
that
i
would
turn
it
down
if
offered
as
a
steam
beer
anchor
is
much
better
as
a
lager
id
rather
have
sa
boston
lager
or
frankly
even
something
like
pbr
could
drink
this
but
with
so
many
other
choices
i
do
not
think
so
but
if
you
like
craft
beer
i
wouldnt
necessarily
recommend
this
beer
unless
you
are
buying
the
mix
pack
the
others
will
carry
the
deadweight
from
this
one
but
please
change
your
label
artwork
though
mildly
hopped
and
void
if
any
carbonation
i
thought
it
had
the
characteristics
of
a
flat
lager
it
was
at
least
easy
on
the
palate
but
given
other
choices
i
would
not
spend
too
much
time
with
it
i
was
not
impressed
and
neither
was
my
palate
this
said
i
still
respect
the
brewery
and
will
also
drink
their
beers
should
i
find
them
nuff
said
good
dark
amber
appearance
with
orange
hues
on
the
edges
light
toasty
malts
and
a
modest
brush
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
a
little
fruity
too
and
caramel
similar
to
anchor
steam
but
overall
the
flavor
is
a
bit
toned
down
its
nice
to
see
a
brewery
with
an
extended
distribution
network
to
brew
this
style
retrospect
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
stronger
taste
for
a
lager
than
average
but
not
up
to
par
with
other
beers
by
this
brewery
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
drinkability
a
decent
beer
but
i
wasnt
that
impressed
this
is
the
california
common
i
can
remember
tasting
besides
anchor
steam
overall
i
prefer
old
scratch
to
anchor
steam
in
the
steam
beercalifornia
common
market
but
maybe
thats
just
me
the
anchor
steam
tends
to
be
a
tad
too
acrid
whereas
the
flying
dog
maintains
a
bittersweet
integrity
throughout
the
brew
d
over
all
a
good
beer
could
be
a
session
beer
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
with
a
whitish
one
finger
head
short
lived
head
leaves
littletono
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
malty
caramel
and
smooth
taste
is
also
sweet
caramel
malty
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
slick
with
a
little
mouthcoating
feeling
and
a
medium
viscocity
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
will
probably
be
enjoying
this
in
the
near
future
if
i
can
keep
my
wife
away
from
it
the
beer
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
sparse
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweetish
malt
not
very
strong
the
taste
is
nice
and
biscuity
just
good
solid
malt
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
from
being
too
sweet
the
feel
is
medium
and
wet
this
is
a
nice
pleasant
beer
and
one
im
sure
i
will
sample
again
this
was
my
fourth
sampling
from
my
mix
twelve
pack
of
flying
dog
beer
the
beer
poured
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
soon
went
away
to
almost
nothing
the
nose
smells
like
a
hint
of
grains
and
some
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
light
hops
mouthfeel
was
good
and
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
d
nice
sessionable
beer
the
malt
character
is
quite
nice
and
the
hops
are
subdued
but
they
come
out
when
they
need
to
overall
no
complaints
but
i
have
to
wonder
why
beer
advocate
classifies
this
as
a
steam
beer
because
it
does
not
really
strike
me
as
one
pours
clear
copper
with
a
big
rocky
head
aroma
is
faint
spicy
hops
taste
is
malty
hints
of
fruit
toasted
malt
a
few
spicy
hops
light
lingering
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
well
carbonated
somewhat
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
a
lot
of
it
pours
out
a
clear
amber
brew
with
a
one
finger
headnice
medium
carbonation
smells
of
sweet
maltinessvery
nice
tasteis
very
light
nowhere
near
as
malty
as
it
smellslight
hopping
actuallt
kinda
disappointing
its
not
bad
at
all
but
reminds
me
of
when
ab
makes
specialty
beers
and
they
are
a
shadow
of
what
they
truly
could
be
d
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
having
at
least
once
to
compare
to
other
steam
style
brews
very
red
color
with
an
active
had
loads
of
carbonation
hoppy
taste
off
the
bat
alcohol
is
present
but
very
malty
overtones
flavorful
and
filling
i
had
two
of
these
and
was
very
satisfied
a
fine
example
of
a
steam
amber
similar
to
anchor
steam
another
solid
one
from
flying
dog
amber
beer
with
small
head
and
big
bubbles
quickly
dissolving
to
zip
nose
is
grainy
malt
light
hops
and
some
spicy
molasses
not
bad
flavor
is
fairly
similar
tastes
a
lot
like
a
slightly
improved
killians
body
is
too
carbonated
but
good
in
terms
of
thickness
i
dunno
this
one
was
alright
as
another
reviewer
noted
flying
dog
stuff
is
generally
okay
not
great
beer
pours
a
deap
amber
with
a
12
of
white
head
that
dosent
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
is
faint
of
grains
and
honey
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
and
goes
into
an
almost
paper
like
dryness
which
finishes
clean
with
an
average
mouthfeel
as
with
most
the
flying
dog
i
have
tastes
not
particularyl
impressive
but
unoffensive
and
drinkable
tastes
a
lot
like
anchor
steam
to
me
but
not
as
good
a
rosey
copper
color
brew
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
and
decent
lace
the
aroma
includes
good
malt
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mellow
caramel
malt
with
a
smokey
background
a
little
thin
watery
but
not
tragically
the
malt
builds
up
as
you
go
a
little
dry
at
the
finish
but
drinkability
is
good
im
satisfied
and
would
have
it
again
d
light
in
weight
and
light
in
influence
overall
just
an
average
but
tasty
amber
lager
here
the
taste
is
a
bit
bland
compared
to
some
craft
brews
but
id
take
this
over
yuengling
any
day
theres
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
in
the
mostly
sweet
and
light
malt
profile
no
real
hops
to
speak
of
but
i
still
enjoyed
drinking
it
for
what
it
was
d
it
is
alright
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
to
good
i
poured
this
beer
from
a
bottle
to
a
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
had
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
that
decayed
rather
fast
the
beer
had
a
bit
of
a
caramel
or
sweet
smell
slightly
sweet
taste
also
but
but
not
bad
at
all
the
beer
was
rich
tasteing
yet
still
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
as
a
summertime
brew
i
would
drink
again
d
a
decent
brew
thats
quite
drinkable
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
this
brew
pours
a
ruby
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
generic
caramel
malt
this
beer
smells
like
dozens
of
others
i
have
had
that
are
dull
and
lacking
in
character
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
the
same
generic
caramel
as
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
sugary
and
gritty
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
i
dont
like
this
beer
and
will
not
drink
it
again
amber
pour
with
little
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
aroma
was
almost
as
bland
and
boring
as
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
okay
as
was
drinkability
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
not
a
lot
of
taste
or
character
but
what
is
has
is
light
caramel
and
toffee
i
have
been
disappointed
with
several
of
the
flying
dog
beers
it
looks
great
and
the
taste
starts
out
great
the
taste
really
falls
off
at
the
end
and
is
definatly
missing
something
not
much
to
the
smell
either
has
a
great
taste
and
mouth
feel
sweet
malty
notes
come
threw
on
the
palate
as
well
hoppy
and
slightly
sour
nothing
to
complain
about
drinkability
innocuous
and
highly
drinkable
nice
session
beer
dits
good
but
not
something
i
would
pick
up
all
that
often
i
would
rather
have
this
from
tap
at
a
bar
so
i
am
finally
working
my
way
through
the
entire
flying
dog
lineup
so
that
includes
going
for
the
mixed
twelve
pack
which
thrilled
me
to
pick
up
anyways
this
poured
a
deep
dark
amber
with
a
nice
burnt
reddish
hue
nice
one
inch
white
head
gave
way
to
a
nice
coating
along
the
top
of
the
glass
not
really
any
residual
side
glass
lacing
to
speak
of
nice
carbonation
bubbles
rippling
up
through
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
nice
lots
of
grains
and
cerals
with
a
hint
of
some
caramel
and
a
touch
of
bittering
pine
hops
mixed
in
a
very
light
off
fruit
aroma
could
also
be
detected
after
a
few
minutes
the
taste
was
very
well
crafted
a
good
malted
back
with
a
good
deal
of
a
hop
character
mixed
in
i
did
not
really
detect
much
of
a
citrus
taste
at
first
but
subsequent
sips
showed
this
to
be
more
pronounced
then
i
had
thought
earlier
very
well
balanced
beer
as
no
particular
taste
won
out
over
another
great
feel
decent
carbonation
but
the
feel
was
very
smooth
and
effortless
a
little
slick
but
not
distractingly
so
rather
easy
drinking
i
could
throw
down
a
six
pack
of
these
with
no
time
definatly
a
chugger
overall
this
was
damn
fine
and
the
first
steam
beer
i
have
had
in
quite
a
while
i
will
definatly
be
having
another
one
of
these
in
the
near
future
this
was
almost
too
good
to
pass
up
if
i
saw
it
i
really
enjoyed
it
pretty
good
brew
but
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
took
my
out
of
the
brew
a
little
bit
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
well
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
fine
california
common
and
another
winner
from
flying
dog
i
dont
know
why
i
had
been
discounting
them
for
so
long
i
was
very
very
wrong
they
are
a
great
brewery
12
oz

a
heavy

that
stays
atop
an
attractive

intrigued
then
a
rich
heavy
lager
taste
with
an
equally
heavy
mouthfeel
which
one
can
interpret
to
mean
difficult
to
swallow
as
this
beer
continues
the
presence
of
malt
increases
in
its
unsubtle
communication
at
bottles
end
only
thoughts
of
light
beers
keep
this
amber
from
earning
the
dreaded
nondescript
title
drinkability
is
also
good
malt
and
hop
flavors
are
in
the
perfect
amounts
recommended
as
a
nice
change
from
a
pale
ale
pours
a
clear
red
amber
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
into
a
small
cap
left
some
nice
lacing
as
i
drank
it
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
maybe
a
hint
of
some
type
of
fruit
not
overly
pronounced
the
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
has
a
weird
rusty
metallic
twang
which
i
think
is
a
result
of
the
malthop
balance
not
very
appealing
though
not
gross
the
feel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
finishes
a
bit
bitter
an
easy
drinking
beer
worth
a
try
though
not
great
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
super
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
very
sessionable
and
very
nice
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
one
finger
white
head
a
very
refreshing
amber
colorclear
body
a
nice
clean
smell
with
some
hop
aroma
in
there
some
malt
smell
but
i
cant
tell
what
type
the
taste
is
sorda
sweet
with
some
bready
malts
and
earthly
hop
taste
this
is
my
first
steam
beer
and
it
is
ok
but
nothing
i
would
run
out
to
try
again
the
carbonation
is
very
easy
on
the
palate
this
is
a
good
summer
time
and
session
beer
bottle
courtesy
of
okbeer
poured
a
copper
color
beer
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
not
much
retention
but
some
surprisingly
good
lacing
taste
of
pure
malt
with
some
subtle
sweet
nutty
notes
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
very
subtle
notes
of
caramel
and
nuts
light
body
with
some
low
medium
carbonation
no
hops
presence
could
be
easily
detected
overall
this
is
was
not
too
bad
as
a
session
al
but
not
something
i
would
go
for
very
often
since
it
did
lack
some
character
not
one
of
my
faves
but
i
might
try
it
again
just
to
see
if
this
batch
wasnt
a
fluke
and
bc
ive
liked
other
flying
dog
brews
pleasant
brew
nothing
spectacular
but
easily
drinkable
on
a
summer
day
a
nice
beer
but
the
bitterness
in
the
flavor
which
is
hard
to
differentiate
between
hops
and
a
smokey
character
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
still
a
good
solid
beer
with
a
unique
flavor
thats
worth
a
try
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
however
d
since
the
beer
goes
down
light
and
still
tastes
good
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
all
night
long
this
beer
pours
amber
as
one
might
expect
there
is
minimal
head
that
doesnt
leave
behind
any
lacing
very
tame
taste
without
many
prevailing
adjuncts
this
taste
is
dominated
by
the
malts
overall
pleasant
beer
but
doesnt
stay
in
memory
for
very
long
good
solid
stuff
here
nothing
to
really
complain
about
if
you
want
a
malty
but
wellbalanced
beer
thats
not
heavy
or
too
alcoholic
here
you
go
the
only
other
steam
beer
i
have
had
is
anchor
this
seems
very
different
from
what
i
remember
anchor
being
might
have
to
pick
up
a
6
of
the
classic
steam
beer
d
you
could
drink
several
you
could
but
i
wont
if
you
want
a
good
amber
lager
reach
for
a
jw
dundees
or
something
i
like
other
things
by
flying
dog
but
this
one
isnt
up
to
par
good
beer
no
shit
amber
obviously
in
appearance
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
taste
is
mostly
of
the
malt
dry
and
crisp
finish
almost
reminds
me
of
a
dry
astringent
vienna
lager
or
marzen
minimal
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
short
finish
sessionable
due
to
the
abv
pretty
much
your
typical
american
amber
d
yes
i
will
have
another
another
great
offering
from
flying
dog
the
carmel
and
nuts
do
overbalance
the
other
flavors
so
if
you
dont
like
those
then
you
will
not
like
this
beer
this
beer
was
ok
it
seems
to
be
a
slight
step
above
a
macro
lager
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
had
no
head
retention
whatsoever
it
was
better
than
most
of
the
other
flying
dog
beers
that
i
have
tried
but
overall
i
was
dissappointed
with
the
sampler
twelve
pack
that
i
bought
with
that
being
said
this
beer
was
hardly
memorable
12oz
brown
bottle
from
florians
crystalclear
brick
brownred
body
with
very
little
head
roasty
malt
dominates
the
aroma
with
hints
of
diacetyl
though
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weaker
than
expected
flavor
has
hints
of
roasty
malt
and
apricot
hops
tastes
good
but
a
bit
weaker
than
expected
no
real
flaws
though
lighter
bodied
and
very
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
tight
thin
head
that
faded
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
unusual
aromas
of
chocolate
and
malt
for
the
stule
wiith
something
medicinal
there
as
well
the
taste
is
also
quite
malty
with
more
cocoa
notes
and
a
little
sour
grain
the
mouthfeeel
is
smooth
but
a
little
slippery
not
my
favorite
the
flavors
are
a
little
bizarre
for
me
to
want
another
it
has
characteristics
of
a
lager
and
an
ale
this
one
is
decent
but
nothing
special
imo
there
is
a
certain
blandness
that
holds
back
its
drinkablilty
a
bit
but
is
fine
for
an
easy
drink
this
is
a
nice
amber
lager
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
decent
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
smell
is
malt
caramel
some
sweetness
a
little
tinny
it
smells
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
deceiving
the
carbonation
in
the
beer
is
just
about
right
the
taste
is
smooth
clean
caramel
slightly
malty
not
much
hop
except
for
maybe
a
tinge
at
the
end
the
aftertaste
is
subtle
this
is
a
lager
that
can
pass
for
an
ale
except
for
the
smell
which
gives
it
away
as
a
lager
not
a
bad
beer
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
drinkability
good
refreshing
lager
for
the
springsummerearly
fall
months
the
taste
gives
it
a
novel
feel
while
not
going
too
over
the
top
worth
keeping
a
six
around
drinkability
good
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
is
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
world
class
overall
a
good
beer
with
solid
qualities
not
one
that
i
think
i
would
ever
crave
for
but
is
nice
but
for
the
style
i
prefer
anchor
steam
thick
and
a
bit
bubbly
with
a
malty
bite
a
bit
ashydry
overall
very
malty
has
a
bite
to
it
typical
amber
competent
but
not
exhilarating
tasted
somewhat
nutty
and
buttery
and
a
tinge
of
that
metallic
twang
quite
smooth
otherwise
more
of
a
session
ale
than
a
lager
is
what
im
thinking
here
final
statement
my
first
california
common
is
a
quite
the
success
im
definately
planning
on
buying
a
sixer
of
this
on
the
first
deck
session
of
the
spring
this
is
a
very
buttery
lager
that
sits
well
with
me
nothing
mindblowing
but
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
good
flavour
d
this
one
isnt
overly
complex
or
intersting
but
i
may
have
found
a
new
session
brew
tasty
and
mild
enough
to
dink
all
night
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
nice
flavor
but
nothing
amazing
drinkability
isnt
very
high
lack
of
flavor
harsh
ingredients
colide
and
not
very
refreshing
cant
really
see
the
point
hopefully
you
enjoy
the
artwork
on
the
lable
overall
a
decent
average
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
a
moderately
light
bright
amber
with
good
retention
and
some
splashes
of
head
retention
leads
into
a
moderately
malty
smell
hints
of
spices
are
present
if
this
beer
were
just
a
bit
more
bitter
and
had
a
slightly
more
bold
mouthfeel
it
may
be
something
to
rave
about
but
its
lacking
in
those
areas
hold
it
back
but
just
a
bit
this
is
a
pleasant
brew
with
good
flavor
just
a
bit
watered
down
d
everything
about
this
brew
makes
me
think
of
autumn
the
color
of
falling
leaves
harvest
smells
and
flavors
otherwise
not
bad
at
all
its
a
good
beer
however
theres
somethign
about
it
that
isnt
great
drinkability
the
alcohol
character
and
strange
aftertaste
really
hurt
this
brew
for
me
not
sure
i
want
to
try
this
again
d
pretty
boring
beer
here
if
it
were
priced
as
a
macro
i
would
prefer
it
over
a
macro
but
its
not
so
i
dont
these
are
preatty
easy
to
put
down
though
since
its
a
ligher
brew
with
nothing
really
offensive
to
it
not
something
id
ever
really
pick
up
again
but
this
would
have
its
merits
as
a
crossover
beer
pours
a
nice
rich
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
and
a
good
lacing
to
the
finish
initial
smell
is
of
peach
or
apricot
taste
is
sweet
fruit
and
caramel
biscuit
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
good
carbonation
but
leaves
a
slick
oily
feel
on
the
tongue
very
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
good
tasting
drinkability
overall
a
subpar
beer
that
isnt
worth
seeking
out
again
but
maybe
ill
try
it
again
someday
i
knew
i
was
in
for
a
sweet
caramel
flavored
beer
as
soon
as
i
uncapped
the
bottle
and
caught
a
bit
of
the
scent
once
i
poured
the
beer
the
aroma
involved
the
hops
but
was
still
predominantly
caramel
the
beer
had
a
slight
citrus
flavor
and
the
hops
added
to
the
complexity
giving
the
flavor
some
bitterness
that
balances
out
some
of
the
sweetness
mild
carbonation
added
to
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
a
bit
thick
in
comparison
to
other
lagers
a
good
brew
nonetheless
by
volume
5
4
the
only
thing
that
keeps
this
from
being
a
session
beer
for
me
is
the
sweetness
but
its
otherwise
a
very
drinkable
but
not
terribly
interesting
beer
d
overall
an
enjoyable
but
not
remarkable
beer
good
balance
in
flavors
but
not
dry
enough
for
my
taste
light
enough
to
be
quaffable
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
found
it
on
a
beer
menu
but
i
doubt
i
would
seek
it
out
specifically
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
lots
of
these
at
a
time
there
are
better
abmer
lagers
out
there
though
drinkability
this
brew
isnt
anything
spectacular
ill
take
anchor
steam
over
this
in
a
heartbeat
snake
dog
ipa
the
other
flying
dog
in
my
mixed
sixpack
along
with
road
dog
is
a
better
flying
dog
option
this
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
bubbly
off
white
head
and
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
quickly
without
much
lace
the
smell
is
sweet
with
munich
and
toasty
amber
malts
the
taste
mimicks
the
smell
as
well
with
the
toasty
maltiness
and
a
little
bitterness
is
aparent
without
much
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
overall
a
moderately
drinkable
beer
but
not
exactly
amazing
di
could
toss
back
a
couple
at
a
party
for
sure
as
macternative
d
tastes
a
bit
like
a
hopped
up
bud
not
many
dominant
flavors
in
therethey
all
sort
of
blend
together
not
sure
about
this
offering
from
flying
dogid
pass
if
had
the
chance
again
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
beer
isnt
overly
tasty
but
a
satisfying
brew
none
the
less
a
lager
most
likely
not
wavz
this
beer
poured
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
that
lasted
for
a
while
the
smell
was
slightly
sweet
and
very
malty
the
taste
is
malty
but
balanced
with
a
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
slightly
creamy
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
goes
down
very
easy
d
decent
drinkability
interesting
beer
that
i
think
could
be
improved
old
scratch
amber
lager
was
amber
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
head
quickly
dissipated
to
almost
nothing
leaving
no
lacing
at
all
the
aroma
was
fairly
light
crystal
malt
with
some
hops
in
the
backround
taste
was
much
the
same
with
the
hops
being
a
little
more
noticeable
it
had
a
fairly
dry
finish
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
a
medium
carbontion
level
drinkablitly
is
decent
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
rich
amber
color
head
was
light
brown
but
very
tiny
maybe
14
lacing
disappeared
almost
instantly
along
with
the
head
nice
blend
of
malt
hops
almost
nutty
taste
slight
aftertaste
very
drinkable
beer
purchased
58
degrees
tucson
az
the
drinkability
is
ok
nothing
special
i
would
not
buy
this
again
it
is
ok
not
bad
just
not
good
enough
to
replace
better
beers
in
the
line
up
mk
old
scratch
has
a
decent
taste
but
not
one
that
i
would
want
to
enjoy
over
and
over
again
poured
nice
dark
amber
color
little
head
which
dissapated
quickly
lacing
barely
exsistent
slightly
fruity
odor
tasted
somewhat
fruity
as
well
with
a
mild
bitterness
to
finish
tad
bit
watery
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
at
a
time
artwork
on
bottle
is
great
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
and
crisp
sugar
cookies
sprinkled
with
brown
sugar
this
is
alright
i
could
easily
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
my
way
to
find
it
probably
would
do
alright
with
food
d
meh
pass
overall
not
a
bad
amber
ale
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
it
would
benefit
from
some
hop
balance
poor
head
but
good
mouthfeel
this
one
is
really
a
personal
preference
thing
after
trying
it
twice
i
probably
wont
try
it
again
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
easy
to
drink
would
be
easy
to
finish
a
6
pack
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
be
good
for
a
serious
drinking
session
or
to
serve
as
a
crossover
beer
if
this
was
readily
available
and
i
felt
like
having
a
few
on
a
hot
night
id
look
for
this
again
sometime
md
seems
a
little
off
for
a
lager
but
its
a
great
beer
overall
i
consider
this
one
of
the
better
brews
offered
by
flying
dog
brewery
an
inoffensive
beer
flavors
are
balanced
and
mild
seems
a
little
thin
on
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
still
drinkable
as
a
session
brew
this
looks
to
be
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
ive
seen
it
pours
very
nicely
into
a
pint
glass
nice
amber
color
w
a
white
puffy
head
that
disperses
into
a
ring
the
smell
is
a
light
hop
scent
it
tastes
fine
w
a
wheatish
caramel
flavor
it
is
average
to
good
i
almost
went
3
5
on
this
one
it
has
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
which
was
nice
it
was
crisp
i
liked
this
better
than
the
other
flying
dog
brews
that
i
picked
up
in
a
sampler
pack
and
wish
there
was
more
than
2
in
there
of
this
kind
overall
i
can
drink
it
but
pretty
bland
drinkability
this
is
easily
quaffable
because
its
unintrusive
and
uninteresting
i
wont
be
having
another
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
and
had
some
but
not
much
lacing
amber
pour
with
a
white
head
aroma
was
weak
but
what
was
there
appeared
to
be
a
malty
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
was
also
not
real
strong
but
was
again
on
the
malty
side
with
a
hint
of
hops
balance
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
a
littel
on
the
weak
side
in
all
areas
this
beer
really
did
not
do
much
for
me
expected
more
from
flying
dog
after
their
pale
ale
and
ipa
overall
it
was
somewhat
drinkable
but
nothing
special
overall
i
cant
say
this
beer
would
be
worth
anything
more
then
a
cursory
try
out
of
a
mixed
pack
you
may
like
it
more
then
i
did
but
i
dont
think
most
people
here
will
this
is
decent
i
have
to
admit
that
im
not
a
big
amber
fan
and
so
the
style
doesnt
grab
me
to
begin
with
poured
into
a
20
oz
pint
glass
with
a
deep
amber
color
that
lightens
to
an
orangeyellow
color
towards
the
bottom
a
slight
head
forms
off
white
in
color
that
slowly
disappates
down
the
glass
leaving
several
rings
along
the
side
the
sweet
scent
of
malt
is
strong
almost
a
candy
scent
not
alot
of
hop
fragrance
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
malt
giving
it
a
very
mild
flavor
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
fairly
smooth
a
slight
after
taste
but
nothing
to
offensive
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
mild
flavor
makes
it
to
want
chug
it
down
overall
a
good
beer
great
to
just
quench
your
thirst
pours
a
clear
browncopper
color
with
a
quickly
fading
head
nose
is
of
hops
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
of
semisweet
roasted
malts
with
followed
by
a
citrusy
hop
bitterness
i
personally
enjoyed
this
brew
it
actually
has
more
ale
characteristics
than
that
of
a
lager
but
overall
a
good
drinkable
beer
d
this
beer
started
with
some
nice
malt
qualities
but
didnt
have
much
to
support
or
balance
the
flavors
several
flavors
were
a
bit
strange
and
im
not
sure
if
it
was
an
old
bottle
or
they
were
just
brewing
flaws
coppery
appearance
clear
and
attractive
with
a
yellow
tinged
head
of
about
14
of
an
inch
after
sitting
for
a
half
a
minute
laces
in
dripping
rings
slight
maple
aroma
tinged
with
a
bright
smell
of
husky
hay
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
almost
medium
carbonation
is
lower
than
i
expected
and
a
bit
tepid
very
neutral
balanced
approach
to
a
flavor
profile
simple
sweet
pale
caramel
malt
of
not
a
lot
of
character
with
a
tinge
of
citric
bittering
just
a
slight
wax
paper
impression
at
the
close
actually
one
of
my
favorite
flaying
dog
brews
certainly
is
pretty
easydrinking
this
is
one
good
looking
amber
in
my
book
i
enjoy
the
color
of
the
beer
it
is
sort
of
in
between
a
dark
and
a
light
i
got
my
first
scratch
in
my
beer
of
the
month
club
and
i
have
been
searching
for
more
ever
since
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
tied
for
first
as
my
favorite
beer
at
the
moment
the
bad
part
is
trying
to
find
more
of
the
beer
where
i
am
located
i
would
highly
recommend
any
beer
from
the
flying
dog
i
sampled
quite
of
few
of
their
tasty
treats
at
the
world
beer
festival
in
raliegh
nc
in
april
2006
freshness
date
of
i
believe
aug06
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
copper
amber
with
a
thin
whitish
head
and
pretty
good
streaking
lacing
aroma
is
decent
foremost
the
hops
and
some
sweet
malt
caramel
in
character
not
feelin
in
mouth
is
pretty
good
a
medium
body
verging
on
syrupy
finishing
crisp
and
even
dry
and
while
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beverage
malts
and
hop
balanced
pretty
well
the
malts
take
on
a
pretty
neat
warming
feeling
while
citris
hops
take
on
nice
oily
notes
overall
though
overcoming
my
dislike
for
most
lagers
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
clear
amber
color
with
copper
on
the
sides
and
a
nice
medium
white
head
which
unfortunately
disappears
too
soon
decent
lacing
aroma
is
malty
with
caramel
and
a
bit
of
yeastyness
i
think
taste
is
similar
leans
on
the
malty
side
i
had
no
idea
this
was
a
steam
beer
helps
me
understand
why
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
lager
at
all
slight
fruity
characteristics
and
a
definitely
vienna
malt
dominance
decent
but
it
loses
everything
towards
the
end
gets
really
thin
with
a
cooked
veggie
taste
unfortunate
nothing
too
special
here
tastes
like
a
decent
homebrew
at
best
pretty
darn
drinkable
even
for
not
being
my
cup
of
tea
this
beer
pours
a
light
red
tinged
with
gold
and
forms
a
light
head
with
lots
of
lacing
no
big
aromas
jump
out
at
me
smells
malty
ok
the
taste
is
primarily
malty
but
the
hops
are
definitely
there
too
i
dont
know
that
i
really
like
the
word
balanced
for
this
beer
more
like
there
is
definitely
a
malty
presence
and
a
hoppy
presence
and
they
are
fighting
with
the
malt
hitting
first
and
the
hop
finishing
they
arent
fighting
in
a
bad
way
though
because
this
beer
goes
down
easily
there
is
a
light
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
finish
i
wouldnt
mind
more
hop
presence
in
this
one
but
its
still
a
good
beer
goes
down
easy
good
not
great
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
pretty
good
cali
common
ive
tried
a
few
that
fell
well
short
this
one
is
pretty
true
to
the
style
very
enjoyable
pours
a
bright
clear
medium
copper
with
a
fairly
small
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
smell
is
sweet
caramel
and
malts
with
some
rum
as
well
along
with
some
phenolic
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
hops
doesnt
blend
well
or
appeal
to
me
a
great
deal
taste
is
quite
malty
at
first
with
grain
and
grass
clippings
along
with
the
caramel
hints
and
fruity
notes
and
a
little
hop
bite
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
still
crisp
and
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
no
real
complaints
but
its
not
great
taste
is
disapointing
booring
and
weak
indistinct
stale
and
unflavorful
taste
too
light
in
flavor
with
a
ligh
mouthfeel
certainly
more
ale
like
than
lager
like
but
really
indistinct
malt
profile
with
a
very
slight
alcohol
wash
toward
the
end
as
there
is
no
malt
backbone
to
hide
it
finishes
dry
balanced
only
in
the
sense
that
nothing
stands
out
in
either
the
malt
or
the
hops
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
flying
dog
you
could
have
easily
convinced
me
it
was
a
macro
beer
why
did
they
even
bother
producing
this
extremely
dissapointed
overall
kind
of
impressed
with
this
beer
in
spite
of
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
expect
i
does
stand
apart
from
anchor
and
some
of
the
commons
ive
brewed
but
not
so
dissimilar
that
it
breaks
style
perhaps
could
have
a
more
robust
flavor
but
i
cant
complain
too
much
about
it
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
quickly
dissapearing
off
white
head
aroma
is
malty
with
only
a
hint
of
hops
has
sort
of
a
macro
aroma
is
one
way
to
put
it
taste
is
of
caramel
and
a
small
hint
of
hops
not
much
there
seems
to
be
lacking
medium
bodied
pretty
smooth
probably
seems
to
be
pretty
good
for
a
session
but
i
would
argue
there
are
better
candidates
than
this
one
pours
a
tawny
amber
with
a
slightly
imperfect
clarity
two
and
a
half
fingers
of
dense
offwhite
foam
show
good
retention
and
good
sticky
lacing
cascade
and
floral
hop
aroma
with
a
faint
fruity
ester
and
strong
toasted
malt
scent
steely
caramel
flavor
but
not
unpleasent
and
a
mild
herbal
tea
taste
in
the
background
slightly
drying
american
hop
aftertaste
with
a
mild
fruity
ester
and
diacetyl
character
as
it
warms
the
carbonation
is
low
and
the
body
light
to
medium
the
dryness
produced
by
the
hops
keeps
the
ester
in
check
and
prevents
any
noticable
slickness
this
also
provides
a
fruitymalty
finish
that
will
fade
and
allow
a
session
caliber
drinkability
good
overall
balance
and
very
enjoyable
albiet
poor
example
of
the
style
d
wonderful
mix
between
malts
and
hops
very
unique
and
very
enjoyable
nice
beer
to
break
someone
into
hops
or
to
break
them
from
macros
enjoyed
this
very
much
light
hazy
peach
colored
beer
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
head
to
it
the
beer
doesnt
have
a
lot
to
the
smell
just
a
sort
of
earthy
grassy
and
orange
smell
the
beer
tastes
very
orange
peel
like
faint
hints
of
grass
no
real
hop
character
to
describe
not
spectacular
in
the
way
of
complexity
but
a
good
enough
beer
to
have
a
few
of
pours
a
nice
crystal
clear
amber
color
the
head
foams
up
nicely
at
first
but
then
drops
to
a
thin
bubbly
film
smell
is
mildly
sweet
with
nothing
else
of
note
taste
is
the
same
sweet
malt
very
little
bitterness
or
character
no
lingering
taste
of
anything
almost
like
drinking
water
very
thin
mouthfeel
i
dont
like
to
slam
beers
but
i
see
no
reason
to
try
this
one
again
there
was
nothing
bad
per
se
about
it
but
also
nothing
noteworthy
either
mouth
feel
is
watery
and
actively
carbonated
this
just
seems
like
another
macro
style
beer
tastes
light
and
sweet
has
a
quick
bitter
punch
in
the
aftertaste
and
goes
sweet
again
nice
mix
its
light
an
smooth
and
very
easily
drinkable
not
too
much
carbonation
really
nothing
preventing
a
good
session
this
is
such
a
good
style
id
like
to
see
more
of
these
then
i
do
they
are
drinkable
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
poured
a
coppery
amber
color
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
thin
and
fizzy
white
one
finger
head
quickly
dissipated
to
very
light
white
lacing
smells
very
light
mostly
of
citrusy
hops
blended
with
sweet
caramel
malt
some
roasted
grain
aroma
present
as
well
taste
is
fairly
simple
caramel
malt
flavorings
are
the
base
that
some
lighter
hop
flavors
build
on
mainly
citrus
nothing
too
outstanding
mouthfeel
is
moderate
carbonation
with
a
light
body
fizzy
on
the
tongue
leaves
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
reasonably
drinkable
beer
just
very
plain
all
around
a
step
up
from
everyday
macro
brews
while
not
a
bad
beer
simply
a
little
disappointing
knowingly
not
the
best
quality
that
flying
dog
typically
offers
in
the
majority
of
their
beers
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
about
average
not
something
id
seek
out
but
not
something
id
turn
down
either
dcould
and
did
drink
the
other
two
bottles
that
came
in
the
pack
got
a
little
tired
of
the
taste
by
the
middle
of
the
third
bottle
but
still
a
very
good
brew
that
is
worth
the
try
an
elegant
looking
beer
with
a
clear
amber
body
that
pours
gracefully
old
dog
shows
enthused
carbonation
a
deft
creamy
head
and
good
lace
my
bottle
yielded
a
light
grainy
aroma
with
a
late
surge
of
malt
sugars
and
a
few
unwelcome
notes
of
bandaid
a
simple
massmarket
lager
taste
is
coupled
with
a
grainy
bitterness
and
a
lingering
finish
that
could
have
been
cleaner
in
fact
its
surprisingly
bitter
for
a
lager
or
steam
beer
with
flat
drab
contours
not
unlike
an
english
ale
overall
its
ok
nothing
really
exceptional
here
but
its
ok
to
toss
back
the
store
i
use
has
6
99
sixers
from
plenty
of
fine
micros
so
i
doubt
ill
be
going
back
to
this
drinkability
is
good
the
abv
is
fairly
low
and
the
beer
isnt
so
uninteresting
that
i
immediately
felt
the
need
to
move
on
not
so
much
on
the
would
i
buy
it
again
scale
though
i
wont
complain
if
somebody
wants
to
leave
a
few
in
my
fridge
again
excellent
distinctive
artwork
right
up
there
with
lost
coast
drinkability
this
is
an
exceptionally
tame
brew
with
its
thin
flavor
and
aroma
barely
stimulating
the
senses
nothing
too
far
beyond
the
depth
and
complexity
of
a
standard
macro
lager
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
12
oz
pilsner
glass
only
about
a
half
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
slight
haze
covering
the
surface
of
the
beer
lacing
is
spotty
down
the
glass
color
is
a
rich
amber
with
nice
hints
of
carbonation
dancing
within
aroma
what
aroma
very
faint
to
nonexistant
whiff
of
water
and
subdued
malts
with
possibly
some
floral
hop
to
minimal
to
even
judge
really
the
tast
is
there
nice
grainy
malt
tones
throughout
with
a
little
hop
in
the
finish
kind
of
a
metallic
tinge
to
the
grainy
aftertaste
not
my
thing
but
910
of
the
taste
is
good
the
mouthfeel
is
not
horrible
but
maybe
a
bit
watery
carbonation
is
adequate
if
you
like
macro
lager
you
will
like
this
one
a
lot
i
would
guess
im
surprised
at
the
california
steam
style
never
would
have
guessed
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
and
ill
look
for
this
again
despite
the
sweet
lack
of
balance
i
give
it
high
marks
for
moderate
complexity
untold
smoothnessand
ultimate
sessionability
i
bet
this
would
be
killer
on
tap
d
carbonation
is
a
bit
over
the
top
for
this
to
be
very
drinkable
decent
as
you
take
the
first
sip
you
get
sweet
light
nutty
body
that
is
even
and
smooth
entire
palate
is
full
with
a
nutty
zest
that
is
welcomed
leaves
a
camilized
hue
on
the
mouth
overall
it
is
dominated
by
a
very
pleasant
nutty
presence
throughout
mouthfeel
including
very
drinkable
but
id
call
thes
more
of
a
nut
brown
ale
this
is
good
suds
poured
out
to
a
orange
amber
color
with
a
good
head
of
about
12
inch
and
rings
of
lace
were
present
medium
level
of
carbonation
aroma
of
hops
and
sweet
grains
taste
was
really
good
flavors
of
hops
malt
grain
and
raw
veggies
blended
quite
well
and
were
not
overly
harsh
or
abrasive
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
well
balanced
higher
level
of
drinkability
i
would
imagine
this
on
tap
would
be
exceptional
and
even
better
than
in
the
bottle
a
good
beer
for
any
time
of
year
recommended
special
thanks
to
battlekow
for
the
sample
okay
i
got
through
this
weak
offering
from
flying
dog
pretty
quickly
simply
to
make
it
go
away
dull
boring
and
uninspired
pass
i
must
have
had
a
different
encounter
with
this
beer
than
most
i
poured
slowly
as
always
into
a
mug
and
the
result
was
no
head
whatsoever
it
is
a
decent
looking
beer
a
nice
orange
tint
the
smell
is
fairly
good
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
nothing
to
brag
about
it
seems
a
bit
watered
down
the
taste
on
this
beer
is
just
plain
insufficient
it
looks
and
smells
much
better
than
it
tastes
to
me
i
would
not
consider
buying
this
beer
again
good
for
sitting
around
the
pool
drinkability
certainly
a
4
for
me
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
in
the
winter
or
anything
but
for
summer
it
seems
to
be
a
pretty
decent
and
very
drinkable
session
brew
a
pleasing
beer
i
am
not
a
big
steam
beer
fan
but
this
seems
to
be
an
ok
example
of
the
steam
style
i
dont
know
man
this
is
a
pretty
boring
brew
even
for
a
typically
watered
style
of
steam
beer
or
california
common
i
think
this
is
a
style
problem
more
than
it
is
this
beer
it
pours
a
copperamber
color
the
head
is
apologetic
but
it
does
have
a
ring
lacing
with
each
pull
malts
make
up
the
jist
of
this
beer
hints
of
caramel
hops
are
an
afterthought
a
very
odd
woody
taste
approaches
the
end
of
this
brew
that
is
annoying
as
hell
never
had
much
success
with
this
brewery
and
this
is
another
example
overall
very
forgettable
very
mild
in
every
category
better
than
the
bmc
not
really
poured
a
medium
copper
color
with
tannish
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
glass
smell
is
extremely
light
with
maybe
a
hint
of
malt
present
taste
is
caramel
and
malt
but
neither
is
very
strong
good
ending
with
a
fruity
dryness
that
is
pleasant
to
the
palate
good
beer
to
try
drinkabilty
very
drinkable
goes
well
with
food
and
goes
down
easy
low
abv
keeps
it
that
way
amber
in
colour
with
pleanty
of
carbonation
loads
of
caramel
malt
aroma
with
this
one
along
with
a
hint
of
roasted
grain
the
flavors
were
generally
smooth
and
malty
with
subtle
notes
of
herbal
hops
roasted
grains
and
a
very
mild
fruitiness
far
better
than
i
expected
probably
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
flying
dog
that
ive
had
drinkability
it
was
a
tasty
brew
with
some
nice
flavors

a
strong

with
a
thin
semifizzy
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
leave

smells
of
caramel
and
spicy
hops
there
is
a
cloying
sweetness
with
some
bitterness
from
the
greenspicy

but
there
isnt
much
else
except
perhaps
a
hint
of
coffee
at
the
end
the
body
is
a
little
tingly
and
the
body
is
medium
to
heavy
for
a
lager
i
really
couldnt
drink
too
much
of
this
because
of
how
sweet
it
is
drinkability
is
about
average
and
definitely
of
from
a
style
standpoint
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
very
fruitylike
ale
brew
appearance
is
a
cloudy
reddish
color
with
some
beige
foam
and
sticky
lace
there
are
some
mildly
clove
or
ester
scented
hops
in
the
aroma
followed
by
citrusfruity
hops
and
roasted
malt
a
little
thin
and
too
much
like
a
nut
brown
ale
for
me
and
there
is
too
much
carbonation
supposed
to
be
a
lager
the
alcohol
asserts
itself
and
dominates
it
is
too
thin
for
an
ale
but
too
strong
for
a
lager
pours
a
golden
amber
colour
with
wispy
white
lacing
slightly
sweet
but
very
little
else
thin
and
watery
a
little
toasty
character
and
slight
hop
flavour
some
diacetyl
too
overall
ok
on
drinkability
better
than
the
mainstream
lager
but
wont
have
again
a
very
enjoyable
amber
lager
i
am
typically
not
a
fan
of
these
beers
because
of
their
cloying
sweetness
with
little
complexity
old
scratch
pours
copper
to
golden
like
a
pale
ale

malty
caramelly
toasty

than
most

clean
finish
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
im
reviewing
this
simultaneously
with
anchor
steam
beer
to
compare
it
matches
up
pretty
well
with
the
old
sea
dog
just
a
bit
off
in
every
regard
its
the
same
great
amber
color
of
anchor
steam
but
is
a
little
clearer
and
has
a
puny
head
just
looks
like
less
of
a
beer
smells
and
tastes
a
little
sweeter
and
sharper
than
the
as
at
the
same
time
its
also
more
bitter
mouthfeel
is
thinner
more
watery
not
bad
though
glorious
thats
the
only
way
for
a
malt
head
to
describe
this
wonderful
creamy
malty
complex
concoction
poured
a
deep
orangeamber
in
the
glass
with
an
off
white
rocky
cap
and
good
lacing
moderate
carbonation
allows
the
flavors
to
charge
through
aromas
are
sweet
caramel
malts
with
slight
fruitishcider
tones
the
taste
is
very
malt
biased
with
the
sweet
caramelbiscuit
malts
float
on
a
creamy
mouth
feel
woody
herbal
slightly
tangy
hops
show
in
the
middle
and
long
wet
finish
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
lager
with
some
malt
characteristics
of
a
vienna
and
a
creamy
delivery
great
stuff
pours
translucent
crimson
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
at
first
but
no
head
not
much
lacing
smells
include
some
nice
roasted
hops
citrus
notes
a
small
bit
of
wheat
and
alcohol
taste
is
mainly
light
wheats
and
some
punchy
hops
with
citrus
rather
light
bodied
a
good
session
beer
it
leaves
residual
bitterness
and
alcoholness
in
your
mouth
though
all
and
all
a
very
refreshing
and
clean
tasteing
beer
but
not
at
all
what
i
had
expected
from
it
this
had
to
me
the
least
body
of
any
of
the
flying
dog
beers
ive
tried
it
is
a
good
beer
and
is
worth
a
try
but
i
just
wasnt
impressed
its
overall
pretty
good
its
a
well
balanced
brew
with
few
surprises
certainly
not
the
worst
but
is
probably
on
the
lower
end
of
flying
dogs
line
id
drink
it
again
overall
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
anchor
steam
and
would
consider
it
a
fairly
good
uncomplicated
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
craft
beers
more
like
a
lager
than
a
lot
of
micros
but
highenough
quality
that
i
would
feel
pretty
decent
about
recommending
it
drikability
was
average
i
cant
see
buying
this
again
but
then
even
though
i
liked
anchor
steam
im
more
inclined
to
buy
liberty
ale
for
more
flavors
i
dont
know
if
id
have
many
more
of
these
amber
colored
with
a
white
head
that
stays
around
the
glass
untill
the
end
smells
slighty
hoppy
and
has
a
lond
of
roasted
malt
aroma
taste
like
sweet
roasted
malts
up
front
and
is
balanced
by
a
spicy
hop
has
a
smooth
body
and
a
great
drinkabilty
a
tasty
lager
and
should
be
a
regular
for
me
medium
bodied
to
the
light
side
its
ok
but
nothing
special
looks
like
and
amber
smells
like
and
amber
tastes
like
and
amber
solid
brew
slight
carmel
like
malt
tradin
shots
with
some
mild
hop
tones
medium
bodied
def
drinkable
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
just
a
pretty
good
stab
at
the
style
cost
effective
too
poured
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
rather
impressive
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
im
not
used
to
lagers
so
ill
have
to
review
this
one
as
best
as
i
can
had
a
very
light
taste
could
taste
the
light
hops
a
light
malt
that
was
less
prevalent
than
the
hops
some
fruit
kind
of
a
mild
apple
taste
to
it
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
thus
far
this
might
not
be
the
best
amber
out
there
but
it
went
down
smooth
while
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered

nothing

the

is
this
a
california
commonsteam
beer
who
know
or
cares
eych
another
lackluster
beer
from
flying
dog
not
a
bad
beer
really
but
not
something
ill
be
looking
for
on
shopping
trips
if
floral
hopped
lagers
are
your
thing
you
will
be
right
at
home
with
old
scratch
amber
lager
from
flying
dog
brewery
i
think
this
beer
is
underrated
it
is
a
hybrid
beer
and
it
definitely
has
both
ale
and
lager
characteristics
but
it
leans
more
towards
an
ale
it
pours
a
medium
amber
color
and
has
a
thin
white
head
it
smells
malty
and
yeasty
pretty
inviting
to
me
the
flavor
is
interesting
it
is
a
it
schizophrenic
but
it
is
supposed
to
be
is
it
a
lager
or
is
it
an
ale
is
it
really
a
steam
beer
who
cares
it
is
a
good
beer
and
worthy
of
companionship
on
a
worthy
evening
12
oz
bottle
obtained
from
westminster
liquor
colorado
in
jan
2005
and
consumed
that
same
evening

a
slightly
coudy

light

penetrating
caramel

remniscent

and
some

caramel
sweet
fruity
despite
being
a
lager
the
frutis
are
mild
and
consist
of
orange
playing
off
of
tangerine
a
very
sutle
vienna
malt
maybe
even
biscuit
flavor
good
carbonation
which
allows
the
malt
sweet
to
hang
around
a
bit
a
bit
too
sugary
for
my
tastes
but
okay
all
around
moderate
lacing
and
medium
light
bodied
ng
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
nothing
really
noteworthy
about
it
either
if
its
the
best
choice
around
id
go
for
it
but
thats
pretty
much
the
only
reason
to
buy
this
the
taste
is
mostly
malt
true
to
the
smell
there
is
a
very
slight
sourness
to
this
brew
the
hop
does
show
up
but
only
as
a
harmonic
interlude
the
beer
is
above
average
in
body
not
my
favorite
beer
from
flying
dog
overall
impression
an
interesting
lager
but
not
one
id
seek
out
again
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
head
thats
sticks
well
down
the
glassquite
a
dose
of
citruisy
hop
in
the
nose
along
with
a
toasted
grain
not
i
pick
up
a
touch
of
caramel
as
well
quite
a
hoppy
flavor
up
front
citruisy
and
pineyget
like
a
brown
suger
flavor
coming
thru
big
late
an
in
the
finish
hey
a
well
rounded
lager
with
enough
hops
to
make
it
somewhat
interestingmuch
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
got
two
in
the
sampler
pack
dont
know
what
ill
do
with
the
other
drinkability
a
decent
thirst
quencher
but
left
me
wanting
more
substance
than
this
pours
an
amber
color
duh
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
falls
away
to
nothing
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
floral
some
sort
of
hops
there
but
i
dont
know
what
kind
the
flavor
is
slightly
hoppy
and
has
a
sweetness
with
a
caramel
malt
flavor
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
fine
but
it
didnt
seem
all
that
special
to
me
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
orange
to
amber
color
with
a
weak
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
is
essentially
nil
on
this
beer
some
faint
caramel
malt
scents
but
even
that
might
be
a
stretch
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sour
with
notes
of
carmel
malts
there
is
also
a
light
tanginess
and
perhaps
a
citrus
flavor
the
beer
is
sharply
carbonated
and
and
it
distracts
from
what
little
flavor
may
be
there
the
first
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
its
sweet
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
i
can
detect
a
faint
hint
of
hoppy
afterbite
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
light
bodied
lager
with
a
pleasant
taste
i
could
put
away
a
few
of
these
fairly
quick
however
its
nothing
to
get
excited
about
it
was
pleasant
but
nothing
about
it
stood
out
as
being
great
in
my
opinion
this
is
just
your
average
microbrewed
lager
if
youre
looking
for
a
decent
lager
there
are
plenty
of
other
beers
that
are
just
as
good
plus
a
whole
lot
cheaper
like
yuengling
or
shiner
bock
this
isnt
something
ill
go
out
looking
for
but
id
drink
it
againfor
free
or
very
cheap
rather
rich
in
taste
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
would
be
plenty
for
me
pours
a
nice
amber
colour
with
a
fairly
large
and
mildly
sticky
head
pretty
good
stuff
thusfar
the
smell
is
slightly
above
average
malt
some
grain
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
hopmalt
balance
is
much
more
even
in
the
flavour
as
hops
couldnt
even
really
be
detected
in
the
smell
there
a
slight
toasted
bread
flavour
mixed
in
along
with
a
touch
of
caramel
before
a
moderate
hopbite
finish
i
would
have
liked
this
one
to
be
a
bit
biggerfeeling
but
overall
its
a
fiarly
tasty
brew
that
could
be
spruced
up
a
bit
but
is
by
no
means
offensive
a
tad
boring
but
tasty
nonetheless
this
reddish
lager
did
not
pour
much
of
a
head
the
smell
was
good
of
carmelized
malts
the
taste
was
interesting
a
nice
blend
of
the
carmel
malts
and
a
bit
of
a
hop
finish
to
make
it
interesting
i
thought
this
was
a
bit
thin
but
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
the
flying
dog
line
seems
to
be
made
for
summer
a
very
flat
beer
allaround
the
taste
is
nothing
impressive
the
hops
and
malts
are
there
but
not
much
that
tantlaizes
the
tongue
the
aroma
is
of
malts
im
assuming
thats
the
amber
aspect
there
are
hints
of
toffee
in
and
around
the
beer
but
nothing
that
makes
this
beer
stand
out
to
me
it
poured
the
color
of
mud
with
no
head
and
no
lace
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
solid
version
true
to
the
style
no
surprises
here
yet
no
disappointments
either
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
got
its
ups
and
downs
had
to
visit
old
scratch
at
least
once
it
was
worth
the
money
light
bodied
and
goes
down
okay
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
that
flying
dog
has
to
offer
pours
out
a
fine
clear
amber
colour
smallish
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
at
first
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
scotch
and
piques
my
interest
sweet
malt
on
the
next
pass
with
an
odd
sourness
as
well
that
doesnt
quite
detract
ripe
fruit
and
then
leafy
hops
it
smells
like
autumn
damnit
in
the
flavour
is
an
odd
balance
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
citric
hops
and
a
curious
sourness
from
the
hops
as
well
in
the
form
of
a
lemon
rind
tartness
perhaps
the
latter
is
influenced
by
the
yeast
full
mouthfeel
that
blankets
the
palate
rich
texture
its
definitely
not
the
best
sample
of
the
flying
dog
line
ive
been
able
to
try
yet
but
the
scotchfall
equinox
nose
and
seductive
mouthfeel
make
this
a
curiosity
that
ill
probably
revisit
again
just
to
see
if
those
two
show
up
to
the
next
party
if
not
then
id
probably
cross
old
scratch
from
my
dance
card
in
favour
of
better
endowed
prospects
fying
dogs
old
scratch
displays
a
crystal
clear
copper
body
with
a
reddish
cast
beneath
a
goodsized
head
of
ivory
foam
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
nice
splashes
of
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
combines
a
delicately
sweet
and
subtly
caramelish
toasty
maltiness
with
a
nice
touch
of
yeasty
fruitiness
its
lightly
crisp
and
then
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
medium
body
and
carbonation
the
flavor
reveals
a
richer
maltiness
than
the
nose
suggests
with
some
munich
or
vienna
malts
and
probably
a
good
dose
of
crystalcaramel
as
well
grassy
and
leafy
hops
become
apparent
towards
the
swallow
along
with
a
very
nice
fruitiness
strawberries
sweet
apple
pear
and
it
finishes
lightly
sweet
and
lingering
but
never
cloying
theres
just
enough
bitterness
there
to
keep
it
from
going
out
of
bounds
well
done
what
a
lovely
surprise
expecting
a
bland
mushy
lager
and
ending
up
with
a
juicy
tart
and
savory
steam
beer
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
despite
my
blah
review
i
think
this
makes
for
a
nice
social
beer
where
there
is
less
empahsis
on
thinking
about
what
youre
drinking
and
just
drinking
a
beer
this
has
a
nice
amber
copper
color
the
head
is
good
not
as
fizzy
as
their
others
a
thin
layer
of
lace
taste
is
pretty
light
and
simple
mostly
thin
watery
sweet
alcohol
taste
not
their
best
beer
but
it
came
in
a
sampler
so
i
didnt
lose
out
too
bad
pours
a
deep
amber
color
nice
very
little
head
and
little
if
no
lace
lingering
the
aroma
is
somewhat
fruity
cherrylike
maybe
the
taste
is
good
not
exceptional
but
good
there
is
that
fruity
taste
and
a
small
but
apparent
hop
taste
that
lingers
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
the
beer
finishes
even
and
smooth
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
drink
any
time
bitter
hops
great
the
tongue
followed
by
some
sweetness
from
the
malts
finishing
all
bitter
not
enjoyable
i
was
actually
a
bit
surprised
by
this
beer
i
hadnt
been
impressed
by
most
of
the
flying
dog
series
but
this
well
its
nothing
special
but
as
it
warms
it
actually
becomes
a
nice
simple
tasty
session
beer
id
try
this
again
if
i
got
it
in
a
mixed
pack
overall
this
is
what
i
would
call
a
good
lawnmower
beer
great
on
an
extremely
hot
day
when
you
need
a
thirst
quencher
but
lacking
in
substance
beer
is
always
good
happy
beering
t
this
beer
has
no
soul
very
cool
label
but
nothing
but
water
in
the
bottle
not
recommended
to
sum
up
this
beer
eh
while
it
looks
quite
good
with
a
white
head
on
a
brilliantly
colored
amber
body
theres
little
of
substance
to
the
beer
the
grain
and
grass
aroma
was
sub
par
and
the
flavors
less
impressive
it
was
an
uninteresting
blend
of
grassy
notes

about

would

the

i
would

surprised
me
easliy
my
favorite
of
the
flying
dog
line
that
ive
tasted
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
with
some
sass
and
some
sauce
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
malt
profile
is
round
and
warm
and
it
combines
with
the
understated
hops
to
bring
a
tasty
blend
to
the
table
for
my
money
it
drinks
well
and
capably
id
never
say
no
to
one
and
might
even
actively
look
for
it
amid
some
damned
stiff
competition
thats
pretty
decent
praise
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
isnt
bad
either
id
rather
have
an

if
a

had
a

of
this

could
share
it

possibly
some

a

seems
to
pop
up
as
well
the

profile
seems
skewed
in

direction
but
thats
acceptable
for
an

in
my
book
and
helps
the
drinkability
quite
a
bit
i
havent
been
impressed
with
flying
dog
in
the
past
and
old
scratch
amber
lager
does
nothing
to
change
that
if
the
brewery
put
as
much
effort
into
their
beer
as
they
put
into
their
labels
they
might
end
up
with
something
a
little
better
than
merely
decent
this
beer
is
an

this
one
is
probably
worth

just
not
up

it

it

a

at
first
the
taste
gets

quick
with
an
abundance
of
astringent
citrus

notes
a
graininess
lingers
on
mouthfeel
is
average
drinkability
is
good
as
is
the
case
with
most
ca
commons
ive
had
i
like
it
but
are
we
sure
this
brewery
isnt
an
extension
of
coors
or
bud
some
of
their
beer
is
well
made
but
lacks
any
special
qualities
this
is
a
one
time
purchase
and
ill
be
picking
up
anchor

if
i
want
this
style
again
the

highly
drinkable
beer
its

this
beer
poured
out
a
very
bright

color
and
was
topped
off
with
a
thin
head
of
foam
that
left
small
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
gave
off
something
like
sweet
bananas
and
sweet
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
semisweet
with
caramel
notes
and
is
very

on
the

not

a
card
playing

this

be
a

to

to
a

to

the

this

the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
oily
and
tangy
for
me
it
is
smooth
and
this
is
a
refreshing
lager
very
nice
medium

beer
i
would
drink
another
despite
the
tangy
mouthfeel
this
tasted
a
lot
like
the
the
dunkles
i
had
at
gordon
biersch
but
its
a
bit
better
as
it
has
more
flavor
its
basically
your
typical
dark
lager
flavors
with
just
a
little
more
character
probably
coming
from
the
steamstyle
brewing
of
course
thats
why
anchor
steam
is
good
for
a
lager
so
its
no
surprise
when
i
had
my
first
one
i
had
my
doubts
but
this
2nd
bottle
that
ive
reviewed
seems
to
be
a
lot
better
not
a
bad
representation
of
such
a
unique
beer
and
another

comments

its
tough
to
pull
off
the
even
hopmalt
flavoring
and
retain
smoothness
but
flying
dog
did
a
good
job
of
it
here
the
rathskeller
wine
beer
festwhen
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
had
a
small
sized
tan
head
that
contained
fine
sized
bubbles
that
fully
dissipated
the
body
was
clear
with
no
carbonation
the
hue
was
amber
and
the
nose
was
lightly
hoppy
and
malty
and
fruity
the
flavor
was
bitter
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
smooth
and
lightmedium
bodied
this
beer
tasted
more
like
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
dark
amber
color
head
is
off
white
and
foamy
aroma
is
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
a
medium
bodied
steam
beer
malts
are
very
smooth
and
sweet
nutty
and
soft
hops
are
a
touch
citrusy
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and

aftertaste
is

crystal
clear

tone
with
a
full
inch
of
foam
sitting
on

around
my
pint
aroma
has
some
zesty
lemony
tones
along
with
a
mild
sweetness
and
caramel
malt
tones
to
it
very
nice
aroma
pleasant
and
appeasing
to
the
senses
flavor
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
edge
to
it
then
a
wave
of
hop
bitterness
blended
with
a
sharp
sweetness
created
from
the
malt
and
mild
fruit
tones
also
arise
in
the
finish
crisp
with
a
nice
hop
profile
that
does
compare
to
anchor
steam
on
tap
however
the
bottles
never
seem
to
travel
well
from
san
fran
but
i
can
compare
this
to
the
draught
version
mouthfeel
from
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
is
slightly
syrupy
texture
with
a
sharp
carbonation
to
tickle
the
palate
nice
drinkability
not
dying
for
another
could
easily
consume
this
amber
lager
purely
due
to
the
fact
that
it
does
have
a
really
nice
flavor
profile
medium
amber
color
with
a
light
cream

a

as
you
quaff
mild

is
lightly
sweet
with
some

and
rather

being
swept
up
by
some
lemon
grass
hop
flavors
fairly
clean
finish
but
there
is
a
lingering
battle
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
as
with
over
5
id
expect
a
bit
of
body
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
dichotomy
of
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
wears
on
me
a
bit
almost
poured
2
bottles
into
my
larger
1l
glass
glad
i
didnt
as
12
ounces
is
enough
of
this
for
one
night
this
beer
pours
as
the
name
that
it
was
given
a
nice
amber
color
it
gave
off
a
thick
head
which
left
a
sticky
lace
to
the
end
of
the
glass
very
nice
the
aroma
was
mostly
malt
and
some
caramel
tones
are
noted
nothing
overpowering
with
the
aroma
the
taste
was
very
nice
a
straight
shot
of
malt
with
the
caramel
notes
mixed
in
giving
it
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
the
flavor
but
the
hops
came
in
at
the
end
to
give
it
a
slightly
bitter
finish
over
all
a
nice
brew
light
body
and
very
drinkable
this
is
the
first
from
the
flying
dog
that
i
enjoyed
the
beer
pours
just
as
its
name
calls
for
amber
there
is
little
head
but
a
nice
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
of
a
traditional
lager
but
with
the
addition
of
caramel
malts
giving
it
a
amber
color
and
aroma
im
not
a
particular
fan
of
lager
beer
due
to
the
fact
that
most
are
so
simplistic
in
make
up
they
hardly
ever
meander
from
the
regular
the
taste
is
good
i
like
the
amber
lagers
better
than
a
plain
i
guess
it
must
be
that
there
is
some
malt
character
although
its
still
not
much
the
mouthfeel
is
good
a
low
bodied
beer
a
real
boosers
beer
a
clean
finish
marks
the
end
of
this
beer
not
bad
as
far
as
lagers
are
concerned

lager
body
with
some
of
the
tartness

bitterness
of
an

im
not
quite
sure
how
the
brewer
is
calling
this
a
steam
style
beer
nothing
about
this
reminds
me
of
a
steam
beer
im
guessing
that
the
label
art
sells
the
beer
the
art
is
quite
good
but
the
beer
is
mediocre
its
amber
with
a
brown
tinge
and
little
head
a
metallic
smell
underlays
the
smell
of
butterscotch
making
for
a
not
completely
pleasing
combination
of
smells
the
taste
isnt
much
better
its
pretty
bland
with
just
enough
going
on
to
keep
drinking
it
in
the
hope
it
comes
together
at
some
point
unfortunately
it
never
really
does
the
flying
dog
stuff
just
doesnt
really
cut
it
its
a
clear
amber
color
with
hardly
any
head
at
all
the

caramel
maltiness
caramel
malts
are
pretty
much
the
entire
flavor
as
well
with
a
dry

i
find
more
of
a
toasty
flavor
in
there
as
it
warms
i
enjoyed
it
nothing
exciting
though
pours

an
amber

when
sipped
down
the

of

a
bit
of

and
a
slight

the

had

a

with
an

reduces
to

the

pretty
full
mouthfeel
very
round
and
smooth
almost
buttery
and
then
a
lager
crispness
in
the
end
this
leads
to
lingering
ale
like
flavors
on
the
tongue
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
oily
hops
make
it
very
unlagerish
a
very
interesting
if
not
schizophrenic
brew
and
one
i
found
rather
refreshing
and
fun
to
drink
because
there
is
stuff
going
on
not
normally
associated
with
lagers
id
like
to
try
more
steam
beers
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
the
style
clear
amber
in
color
posseses
a
thin
and
dense
offwhite
head
that
is
well
retained
leaves
some
nicely
ringed
lace
nice
caramel
malt
aroma
with
brown
sugar
mixed
in
pretty
clean
tasting
caramel
maltiness
is
the
main
player
but
there
is
also
some
spiciness
and
dryness
added
by
the
hops
a
little
better
than
average
if
that
dark
orange
in
color
a
little
lace
i
get
caramel
maltiness
on
the
nose
but
it
is
very
soft
the
taste
is
of
light
caramel
a
touch
of
ale
like
fruitiness
i
guess
this
is
a
steam
beer
with
lager
yeast
used
at
ale
temperatures
its
decent
finishes
dry
surprisingly
enough
just
a
little
too
tart
on
the
finish
for
an
amber
lager
but
it
is
definitely
interesting
initially
this
brew
pours
with
a
nice
deep
amberorange
color
the
delicate
lace
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
the
aroma
is
very
lightly
malty
overall
the
flavor
is
quite
light
as
is
the
body
slightly
sweet
maltgives
way
to
a
light
but
sharp
bitterness
that
disappears
with
a
crisp
finish
this
is
the
last
of
a
sixer
i
bought
3
or
4
weeks
ago
the
1st
was
the
best
this
is
noticeably
different
definitely
amber
approaching
dark
side
of
the
spectrum
so
they
got
that
right
head
fizzled
out
and
mouthfeel
is
flat
but
at
the
beginning
i
remember
it
being
fine
strong
piney
hops
which
are
the
appeal
of
this
beer
giving
it
a
unique
character
balanced
by
forceful
caramel
buttery
malts
like
others
have
noticed
some
ale
flavors
this
is
a
good
beer
filling
and
crisp
and
its
changed
my
opinion
of
flying
dog
after
i
sampled
their
unpleasant
yogurttasting
scotch
ale
a
couple
years
back
dark
copper
in
hue
w
brilliant
clarity
topped
by
a
one
fingered
persistent
off
white
head
attractive
lace
is
left
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
medium
caramel
malt
and
resiny
citrusy
hops
with
a
hint
of
sweet
fruity
esters
biscuit
notes
become
discernible
as
the
brew
warms
the
flavor
profile
is
clean
overall
and
consists
of
dominant
caramel
sweetess
and
bready
malt
with
mild
hop
bitterness
providing
adequate
contrast
lightly
bodied
but
with
a
mouthfeel
thats
oddly
slick
and
oily
see
portland
woodstock
ipa
finishes
with
caramel
sweetness
and
more
of
the
oily
tongue
coating
sensation
lingering
flavorwise
this
is
an
enjoyable
california
common
steam
lager
yeast
fermented
at
ale
temps
but
the
oily
mouthfeel
and
finish
was
a
bit
offputting
notes
a
pretty
good
brew
very
flavourful
but
seems
to
have
some
ale
qualities
and
finishes
like
an
ale
also
with
stronger
than
normal
alcohol
qualities
copper
colored
with
a
lightly
toasted
malt
aroma
good
balance
of
subdued
sweetness
and
spicey
hop
flavors
pretty
decent
amber
lager
although
i
would
pick
several
others
ahead
of
flying
dog
namely
wagner
saranac
sa
boston
lager
etc
too
bad
many
more
worthy
micros
dont
have
the
distribution
resources
that
fd
seems
to
well
the
old
doggie
got
me
again
i
had
it
in
my
head
these
beers
would
be
lousy
but
i
really
really
liked
this
one
as
well
did
i
get
an
ipa
in
an
amber
lager
bottle
nice
copper
color
big
fluffy
head
with
tiny
hop
bubbles
coming
through
lots
of
hop
smells
and
some
slight
sweetness
the
taste
is
pleasantly
hoppy
with
an
equal
balance
of
malty
sweetness
unbelievably
pleasant
and
drinkable
just
the
right
body
balance
hops
and
carmel
sweetness
i
must
have
got
the
best
of
the
batch
this
stuff
was
really
tasty
despite
my
doubts
this
brewery
is
3
for
3
with
me
just
goes
to
show
how
many
great
beers
are
available
if
you
just
look
a
little
i
will
buy
it
again
cloudy
bronze
in
color
with
a
rather
full
white
head
initially
fades
fairly
quickly
decent
amount
of
sticky
lace
potent
hops
dominate
the
aroma
also
slight
fruit
notes
flavor
is
quite
distinct
strong
hops
initially
with
underlying
tangy
citrus
flavors
then
roasted
malt
and
more
hops
towards
the
finish
a
complex
and
satisfying
beer
other
than
that
this
is
a
pretty
decent
and
drinkable
beer
great
appearance
nice
bronze
color
in
the
glass
and
held
to
the
light
takes
on
a
ruby
glow
not
sure
i
would
classify
it
as
a
bock
the
bottle
calls
it
an
amber
lager
seems
more
in
line
with
a
vienna
amber
i
e
dos
equis
solid
malt
with
nice
hops
balance
a
bit
more
alcohol
kick
at
the
finish
than
average
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
an
average
but
tasty
amber
beer
o
based
on
its
initial
appearance
this
looks
like
it
should
be
a
better
beer
than
it
is
nothing
worth
pursuing
again
as
the
name
suggests
this
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
grains
and
malts
the
taste
is
rather
malty
with
some
spices
as
well
finishes
slightly
crisp
and
i
actually
think
this
delivers
a
better
spice
flavor
than
their
oktoberfest
not
bad
i
heard
they
were
putting
this
into
hibernation
so
i
wanted
to
try
it
before
i
couldnt
find
it
anymore
classic
amber
pours
a
clear
darken
gold
color
with
a
small
head
there
was
a
very
subtle
malt
aroma
not
really
much
of
anything
the
taste
was
subtle
strawy
malts
with
a
yeasty
like
taste
a
bit
watery
but
still
crisp
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
doesnt
have
that
cheap
taste
some
other
red
lagers
have
o
i
would
probably
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
but
it
wasnt
horrible
very
sessionable
if
my
friend
happens
to
leave
this
in
my
fridge
again
i
will
drink
it
not
bad
enough
to
throw
out
o
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
nothing
stood
out
to
say
i
need
to
have
this
again
immediately
this
is
a
run
of
the
mill
red
lager
the
flavor
is
ok
nothing
too
special
overall
a
decent
beer

o
its
just
an
average
lager
beer
and
i
wouldnt
waste
money
on
it
a
slightly
above
average
amber
that
was
better
than
expected
mouthfeel
is
soft
not
abrasive
in
any
way
very
drinkable
not
an
inyourface
beer
by
any
means
just
an
easy
drinking
dependable
lower
alcohol
lager
that
is
fine
for
any
occasion
or
any
season
to
be
honest
its
much
better
than
expected
this
is
a
very
average
beer
its
not
awful
and
ultimately
drinkable
but
its
rather
one
dimensional
and
forgettable
overall
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
this
again
there
is
really
nothing
going
on
here
except
noticeable
faults
and
problems
drinkability
is
practically
near
zero
for
me
d
i
thought
this
would
be
an
ale
since
it
was
in
a
mixer
with
a
red
lager
oh
well
goes
down
easy
enough
but
otherwise
is
less
than
good
a
beer
for
washing
down
food
actually
gets
less
appealing
as
your
drink
it
down
appears
as
a
standard
clear
amber
color
has
exactly
the
same
fizzy
nonhead
no
lacing
as
all
other
leinenkugel
products
ive
tasted
smell
is
very
faint
and
nondescript
i
get
a
vague
sense
of
faded
biscuit
malt
and
some
mild
cooked
corn
tastes
like
a
cross
between
the
nuttiness
of
the
fireside
brown
and
a
corn
adjunct
lager
fizzy
thin
body
just
like
a
soda
pop
this
one
only
just
barely
manages
to
be
a
slightly
better
choice
than
a
bmc
pours
a
clean
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
a
sweeter
malt
and
a
bite
gingerbread
like
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
malt
in
the
aftertaste
a
sweet
gingerbread
malt
to
a
dry
end
eh
really
lacking
any
flavor
otherwise
its
decent
but
fairly
boring
and
a
little
expensive
seems
to
grow
in
price
more
every
year
pretty
mild
might
have
a
place
with
converting
people
early
on
in
their
foray
into
craft
beer
far
better
than
i
expected
from
this
brewer
but
both
the
marketing
and
the
style
claims
are
out
of
line
the
final
verdict
always
comes
back
to
taste
and
while
it
is
far
from
offensive
it
isnt
going
to
win
too
many
people
over
a
bland
beer
from
a
bland
brewer
blah
this
is
about
as
bland
as
they
come
pours
a
not
at
all
amber
golden
color
with
a
minor
haze
and
a
decent
head
but
this
looks
like
a
pilsner
to
me
the
smell
is
very
basic
too
no
indication
of
those
rich
amber
malts
just
a
very
generic
budweiser
type
nose
taste
is
similarly
bland
with
nothing
to
distinguish
it
as
a
classic
amber
it
is
nto
a
bad
brew
but
it
isnt
what
it
claims
to
be
in
the
slightest
reasonable
mouthfeel
with
medium
body
and
suitable
carbonation
but
this
will
not
be
purchased
again
weak
showing
from
leinys
which
usually
produces
at
least
b
level
beer
bud
lite
i
take
the
classic
amber
overall
its
an
entry
level
beer
definitely
not
a
great
american
amber
and
it
has
a
lot
of
adjunct
lager
qualities
i
find
it
more
pallatable
but
still
very
basic
i
see
this
beer
as
a
gateway
and
can
appreciate
it
at
that
level
this
beer
is
a
great
fall
offering
for
those
who
dig
the
leinenkugel
lineup
i
e
someone
who
likes
going
a
notch
above
macro
overall
expected
big
things
from
this
beer
as
ive
enjoyed
cases
of
the
leinenkugel
sampler
before
not
disappointed
by
its
balance
its
drinkability
and
its
characetrcrisp
yet
full
tasty
yet
smooth
a
beer
i
could
session
in
a
college
bar
for
an
evening
for
sure
the
taste
is
well
average
along
with
the
mouthfeel
it
goes
down
really
easy
and
is
mildly
appealing
but
i
would
compare
this
to
one
step
down
from
most
good
amber
ales
ive
had
but
like
i
said
very
average
o
this
is
decent
no
wow
factor
its
crisp
fairly
refreshing
and
it
goes
down
easy
enough
overall
drinkability
no
off
characters
d
blah
not
that
great
i
dont
know
if
youre
an
amber
fan
you
should
try
it
im
not
a
fan
but
i
also
dont
not
prefer
them
if
that
makes
sense
o
i
like
american
amber
style
brews
simply
put
almost
as
good
as
an
american
ale
but
not
quite
there
a
solid
beer
i
will
drink
again
gave
it
a
semigracious
2
5
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
on
purpose
i
could
flip
a
coin
between
this
and
a
schlitz
so
i
guess
i
do
give
a
schlitz
for
leinenkugel
classic
amber
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
copper
body
with
a
3
inch
fizzy
white
head
that
stays
around
for
a
little
while
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
biscuit
coming
through
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
bitter
hops
coming
though
the
mouth
feel
is
good
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
this
stuff
is
alright
nothing
special
yet
easy
drinking
this
is
a
nice
amber
beer
and
ive
enjoyed
it
more
ontap
than
in
the
bottle
it
tends
to
seem
a
bit
fullerbodied
and
maltier
solid
but
never
blows
me
away
the
classic
amber
pretty
much
reminds
me
of
their
red
lager
the
pour
gives
off
pretty
much
the
same
color
and
head
its
a
redish
colored
liquid
with
a
little
white
head
the
smell
gives
off
a
decent
sweet
aroma
with
some
grainy
malts
followed
by
a
light
hop
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
decently
bitter
with
some
good
malts
in
the
background
the
finish
is
on
the
dry
side
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
the
beer
is
drinkable
to
say
the
least
its
good
for
a
casual
drinking
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
amber
lager
which
would
make
a
great
barbecuing
beer
its
got
a
little
bit
of
character
but
it
is
refreshing
and
sessionable
as
well
d
very
drinkable
as
an
almost
macro
with
a
good
flavor
profile
taste
is
lightly
toasty
biscuity
malts
the
hops
shine
through
in
this
beer
more
than
most
other
macro
produced
amber
lagers
this
beer
was
a
bit
similar
to
yuengling
but
perhaps
a
tad
more
hops
in
this
one
i
still
like
yuengling
a
little
better
though
this
is
true
to
class
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
glad
to
have
it
on
draft
not
sure
i
would
enjoy
as
much
out
of
the
bottle
found
it
quite
drinkable
and
would
have
again
im
a
huge
fan
of
amber
lagers
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
drinkable
but
overall
a
very
average
amber
ale
o
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
would
probably
not
purchase
it
by
the
case
the
days
are
getting
longer
and
warmer
and
saw
a
summer
sampler
12
pack
11
99
so
i
figure
i
would
give
it
a
go
i
used
to
drink
quite
a
bit
of
leines
back
in
my
coast
guard
days1997
in
duluth
mn
leines
was
the
first
hand
crafted
micro
brews
i
had
ever
tasted
we
would
buy
in
wax
box
bar
cases
pretty
awesome
wish
i
could
still
do
that
i
thought
it
was
the
best
back
then
but
only
now
recognize
it
as
a
gateway
beer
to
better
beers
so
thanks
classic
amber
is
a
great
looking
golden
caramel
pours
with
a
great
head
that
dissipates
quickly
tones
of
grains
and
apple
taste
water
down
but
i
guess
you
could
make
this
a
hot
summer
day
light
session
beer
i
always
think
leinenkugels
is
best
enjoyed
on
a
canoe
or
around
a
campfire
pours
a
nice
color
but
a
little
light
for
an
amber
crystal
clear
a
light
head
and
good
carbonation
smells
of
yeast
and
grain
but
only
very
mildy
taste
is
clean
but
a
little
to
smooth
for
this
variety
not
alot
of
malts
and
somewhat
watery
so
on
the
plus
side
drinkability
will
be
up
but
left
me
with
a
full
feeling
and
tired
and
a
bad
headache
not
something
i
would
sit
at
a
bar
and
order
something
new
to
try
though
d
i
had
no
problem
consuming
this
beer
but
there
was
nothing
special
about
the
taste
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
another
one
all
in
all
rather
average
i
suppose
it
doesnt
excel
nor
offend
in
any
way
d
not
really
all
that
horrible
but
i
cant
see
that
its
something
i
really
want
to
drink
again
it
is
pretty
well
balanced
just
not
much
flavor
to
speak
of
a
basic
example
of
this
style
drinkability
easy
beer
to
drink
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
flavor
but
overall
pretty
good
d
good
evryday
beer
and
one
that
should
be
enjoyed
everyday
not
bad
but
not
great
it
would
do
well
when
the
selection
is
poor
drinkability
nothing
at
all
complex
or
interesting
in
taste
but
at
the
same
time
not
bad
tasting
for
its
likely
intentions
this
beers
is
not
a
bad
brew
taste
nothing
too
exciting
but
it
is
not
bad
it
has
somewhat
of
a
dry
taste
but
without
any
bitterness
d
i
am
glad
i
did
not
purchase
this
beer
but
drank
it
at
a
friends
house
d
i
didnt
understand
the
hype
behind
this
beer
it
is
just
a
dressed
up
macro
offering
not
bad
but
not
good
either

it

medium
the
taste
brings
out
the
sweet
malt
character
a
bit
more
than
in
the
aroma
but
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
pale
ale
rather
than
a
red
it
is
just
missing
something
drinkability
it
is
rare
that
my
favorite
element
of
a
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
but
that
is
the
case
with
this
one
otherwise
the
flavor
profile
is
clearly
aimed
at
the
middle
of
the
road
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
just
not
something
i
am
likely
to
seek
out
again
overall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
good
amber
it
may
be
pretty
hoppy
for
its
style
but
it
tends
to
benefit
this
beer
i
drink
this
beer
pretty
often
and
i
am
glad
leinenkugels
added
this
to
their
year
round
line
up
this
beer
wins
the
clown
award
for
funny
taste
why
would
i
pay
a
premium
price
for
a
beer
that
tastes
this
bad
rates
very
low
on
my
scale
avoid
this
one
at
all
costs
save
your
loot
for
a
better
beer
this
is
even
worse
than
some
of
the
big
brewers
massproduced
stuff
this
beer
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
has
decent
retention
with
very
little
lacing
and
moderate
carbonation
when
drinking
this
i
get
some
malts
in
the
taste
with
maybe
a
slight
caramel
taste
and
the
last
taste
i
get
is
a
citrus
taste
which
remains
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
a
little
sticky
that
clings
to
the
tongue
and
lips
this
is
another
leinies
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
do
like
it
when
a
beer
is
easy
to
drink
pours
a
moderate
amber
color
with
a
singlefinger
white
head
that
soon
trickles
down
into
nearly
nothing
the
nose
has
some
toasted
bread
and
some
light
caramel
as
well
as
a
faint
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
sugary
with
some
bread
crust
and
light
toast
lighttomedium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
pretty
ordinary
but
not
bad
d
average
drinkability
i
would
drink
one
if
someone
bought
it
for
me
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
there
are
better
red
lagers
out
there
this
one
just
runs
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
i
like
this
beer
there
is
almost
a
sweet
flavor
to
it
like
brown
sugar
or
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
there
is
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
but
its
not
bad
drinkability
is
average
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
brewerys
other
beers
but
this
is
something
i
could
enjoy
every
once
in
a
while
this
is
the
definition
of
a
mediocre
beer
nothing
about
it
stands
out
as
good
but
nothing
stands
out
as
bad
either
an
inoffensive
choice
you
can
do
better
hey
i
like
the
colour
it
pours
a
deep
amber
into
my
pilsner
glass
it
was
part
of
a
fall
variety
pack
and
probably
one
of
the
better
choices
smells
better
than
my
running
shoes
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
my
hoppy
beers
i
smell
caramel
and
malts
pours
a
deep
head
and
laced
some
but
dissipated
quickly
mouthfeel
is
average
nothing
special
but
better
than
the
typiacal
macrobrew
drinkability
is
fine
i
could
enjoy
a
few
after
a
long
run
or
bikeride
even
some
tennis
c
averagefine
for
guests
but
not
for
close
friends
would
not
seek
it
out
but
i
am
a
hopphead
meet
me
at
the
leinie
lodge
the
first
can
is
on
me
pours
a
very
light
ambercopper
color
with
minimal
head
scent
is
very
weak
with
a
dominant
metallic

scent
over
top
of
a
burried
grassy

and
musty

taste
doesnt
improve
on

i
thought
it
was
off
but
after
reading
the
reviews
it
may
just
not
be
anything
more
than
an
ok
beer
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
one
im
sure
i
will
cross
paths
with
again
will
i
seek
it
out
most
likely
not
d
this
was
a
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
this
a
couple
of
times
now
and
have
grown
to
drink
it
although
1
25
for
a
glass
is
hard
to
beat
its
good
for
what
it
is
and
the
drinkability
is
high
for
that
matter
its
very
malty
very
smooth
100
barley
roasted
just
enough
to
wash
away
most
of
the
breadiness
but
not
enough
to
bring
out
any
bitter
nodes
the
hops
profile
is
surprisingly
complex
but
far
too
faint

light
bodied
with
a
good
deal

carbonation
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
terrible
easy
to
session
for
sure
d
in
the
same
style
as
yuengling
but
its
nowhere
near
as
good
but
much
more
available
one
of
the
few
leines
brands
offered
in
ca
this
beer
is
only
marginally
better
than
bmc
in
fact
id
probably
prefer
a
coors
original
over
this
d
fairly
good
drinkability
not
a
particularly
memorable
beer
d
better
than
a
standard
adjunct
but
not
by
much
a
subpar
beer
from
a
mediocre
brewery
if
youre
going
for
a
leinies
get
the
1888
bock
otherwise
get
an
actual
microbrew
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
darker
beers
but
this
one
is
good
serving
type
draft
overall
not
an
especially
memorable
beer
at
the
same
time
as
usual
leinie
does
not
disappoint

this
isnt
one
i
could
have
too
many
of
and
i
dont
think
ill
be
going
back
for
more
anytime
soon
d
great
drinkability
this
is
a
easy
going
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
anytime
of
the
year
drinkability
a
good
effort
and
a
nice
beer
on
a
summer
night
d
a
good
brew
nice
carbonation
good
balance
nothing
extrordinary
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
this
kind
of
dry
but
refreshing
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
after
a
long
hard
day
drinkability
this
is
an
alright
beer
good
enough
for
parties
or
if
nothing
else
is
around
but
not
anything
too
special
here
i
wouldnt
rush
to
get
this
again
but
would
suggest
it
as
a
gateway
beer
ill
give
leinenkugel
another
chance
but
with
something
else
maybe
their
summer
shanty
i
heard
it
was
pretty
good
d
low
abv
and
very
refreshing
but
it
loses
its
appeal
pretty
quickly
drinkability
really
the
main
feature
of
this
beer
if
you
want
something
which
goes
down
easily
but
doesnt
taste
terrible
this
is
a
good
choice
it
actually
looks
pretty
good
but
the
soapy
smell
is
a
killer
and
the
beer
itself
tastes
a
lot
like
a
light
toasty
märzen
they
must
be
using
those
malts
the
hops
are
pretty
light
here
theres
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
burnt
toast
the
beer
gets
grainy
fast
and
theres
a
metallic
finish
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
its
okay
washed
down
my
indian
food
well
but
nothing
id
seek
out
not
a
great
brew
but
certainly
better
than
a
run
of
the
mill
macro
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
small
big
bubbled
head
that
disapates
rather
quickly
into
a
thin
film
with
very
minor
lacing
a
mild
malted
aroma
but
not
much
else
very
mild
taste
a
bit
biscuty
and
a
very
mild
citrus
finish
very
easy
drinking
beer
not
bad
but
also
nothing
remarkable
d
goes
down
easy
nothing
that
tastes
terrible
but
pretty
macro
like
light
body
almost
watery
at
times
from
the
mineral
taste
mediumlow
carbonation
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
definitely
several
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
i
just
enjoy
this
beer
i
dont
think
im
gonna
go
looking
for
explanations
ill
just
take
it
deasy
drinker
and
my
go
to
beer
from
leinenkugels
a
great
summer
beer
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
it
has
good
flavors
to
it
but
wont
wow
you
or
anything
d
very
drinkable
i
used
to
swear
by
leinenkugels
back
in
college
days
unfortunately
many
of
the
liquor
stores
have
pushed
its
price
pretty
high
because
of
micro
brew
popularity
and
i
would
bet
its
costing
the
same
from
the
suppliers
drinkability
i
cant
think
of
a
good
reason
to
buy
this
again
its
pretty
undistinguished
overall
seems
to
follow
the
pattern
with
all
their
offerings
decent
enough
to
get
by
but
nothing
that
is
going
to
be
earth
shattering
in
anyway
shape
or
form
a
clear
amber
color
pour
with
a
short
lasting
two
finger
fizzy
offwhite
head
high
carbonation
little
to
no
lacing
left
aroma
of
cereal
grain
dry
wood
and
a
hint
at
caramel
flavor
is
pretty
strait
forward
lightly
malty
and
lightly
bitter
a
little
spicy
at
the
finish
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
with
a
light
body
i
would
call
this
quite
drinkable
and
a
decent
enough
offering
this
was
fairly
basic
but
unoffensive
id
choose
it
over
the
average
lager
very
flavorful
yet
light
in
body
and
on
the
palate
a
very
basic
well
balanced
taste
malty
with
just
enough
hop
presence
to
make
it
very
drinkable
this
feels
pretty
rich
in
carbonation
and
leaves
the
palate
refreshed
not
too
bad
for
a
sessionable
lager
drinkability
first
one
was
good
but
i
am
a
little
afraid
that
the
second
one
would
not
be
so
good
but
since
i
only
had
one
i
wont
specualte
and
just
say
that
is
was
good
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brown
color
with
amber
hues
and
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
hops
taste
like
it
smells
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
decent
beer
drinkablity
disappointing
brew
from
leinenkugel
serviceable
but
could
use
a
bit
more
work
on
the
formula
to
improve
the
body
and
cover
up
the
cheap
ingredients
d
bar
i
was
at
was
having
a
special
and
i
thought
it
was
good
enough
to
have
three
times
if
your
looking
for
an
affordable
beer
to
have
with
some
pals
leinenkugels
is
usually
a
good
choice
overall
it
is
not
that
great
of
an
amber
ale
more
on
the
lager
side
drinkability
pretty
good
i
could
certainly
drink
this
one
again
d
i
really
dont
care
for
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
grab
some
chips
or
peanuts
something
to
get
that
after
taste
out
of
my
mouth
ive
talked
to
a
lot
of
my
northern
neighbors
who
really
like
their
leinies
but
i
guess
i
am
just
not
a
fan
overall
i
dont
think
ill
buy
this
one
again
but
it
was
nice
trying
it
drinkability
nothing
i
was
even
tempted
to
reach
for
again
that
night
at
the
bar
or
anytime
soon
of
this
style
there
are
just
so
many
beers
better
out
there
you
will
have
to
not
search
out
this
one
again
maybe
my
tap
was
bad
or
something
but
just
kinda
of
a
let
down
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
white
froth
that
dissipates
somewhat
quickly
for
an
amber
i
would
really
like
to
see
something
darker
this
almost
looks
like
a
pale
ale
simple
aromas
of
grains
light
red
fruit
easy
caramel
light
skunkiness
roasted
nuts
subtle
chocolate
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
not
very
impressive
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
much
better
than
the
nose
with
characteristics
of
roasted
hazelnuts
chocolate
caramel
grains
subtle
citrus
hops
overall
this
is
a
very
simple
straight
forward
beer
that
goes
down
easily
not
bad
but
no
something
that
ill
recommend
another
ok
beer
from
leinies
i
buy
leinies
expecting
a
solid
session
beer
and
thats
about
it
crisp
clean
tasting
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
after
it
warmed
a
bit
i
think
i
actually
tasted
dusted
cocoa
carbonation
was
a
little
more
than
med
color
is
actually
very
appealing
head
fades
quickly
leaving
small
amount
of
lacing
as
im
sipping
tastes
almost
like
their
octoberfest
maybe
with
all
the
big
beers
ive
been
drinking
im
used
to
much
more
flavor
i
think
ill
have
another
o
not
much
going
on
pretty
straight
forward
brew
this
will
appeal
to
many
tasters
but
comes
off
as
a
bit
bland
in
my
opinion
not
bad
amber
ale
however
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
flavor
drinkability
weak
on
taste
dont
bother
with
this
one
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
a
decent
leinenkugels
beer
while
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
them
all
again
for
comparisons
sake
my
sense
is
that
classic
amber
trails
only
creamy
dark
at
the
top
of
the
leinies
heap
big
eddy
russian
imperial
stout
doesnt
count
unless
they
brew
it
again
this
bottle
went
down
pretty
easy
good
with
my
pizza
better
than
bmc
if
the
choices
are
limited
at
the
local
restaurant
this
was
ok
but
not
great
of
the
offerings
from
leinenkugel
i
do
like
this
and
the
creamy
dark
the
best
this
is
the
best
product
leines
has
come
out
with
in
quite
a
while
beer
that
tastes
like
beer
what
a
novel
concept
its
not
mixed
with
lemonade
or
berry
flavoring
or
maple
syrup
its
just
good
amber
beer
it
looks
very
nice
chrystal
clear
orangish
copper
about
two
inches
of
off
white
foam
that
doesnt
last
long
the
smell
is
very
biscuit
like
toasty
malt
with
hops
in
the
background
its
a
little
more
watery
than
i
would
have
expected
a
lot
of
fizzy
carbonation
all
in
all
a
nice
solid
amber
nothing
great
but
solid
a
good
choice
to
wash
down
a
burger
at
the
tavern
average
but
sessionable
at
the
local
watering
hole
if
you
had
no
other
choice
notes
of
the
many
entries
in
the
leinies
lineup
in
recent
years
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
theres
really
nothing
off
about
it
although
the
musty
hops
werent
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
and
its
refreshing
without
being
low
on
flavor
solid
if
thoroughly
unspectacular
beer
all
in
all
a
very
average
to
above
average
beer
id
rather
have
this
than
a
bmc
beer
but
its
nothing
exceptional
either
drinkable
enough
you
could
pound
these
back
while
watching
a
game
or
playing
cards
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
great
either
drinkability
glad
i
tried
it
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
but
it
isnt
something
i
could
drink
regularly
nothing
horrible
but
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
full
six
pack
of
this
just
got
a
single
in
a
mix
pack
drinks
fairly
easy
nothing
earthshattering
but
i
could
happily
drink
34
of
these
watching
football
or
bbqing
one
of
leinies
better
mainstream
offerings
dvery
easy
to
drink
but
not
terribly
enthralling
d
easy
enough
to
get
down
but
i
didnt
care
for
the
taste
could
do
a
lot
of
these
watching
football
and
eating
pizza
but
really
will
be
avoiding
this
one
on
a
side
note
im
still
amazed
that
i
bought
a
12
pack
of
this
for
6
at
supreme
liquors
in
quincy
ma
6
packs
were
3
pretty
friggin
good
pricing
on
an
average
brew
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
some
orange
tint
with
a
nice
white
to
slightly
off
white
head
to
it
the
smell
is
of
caramel
and
some
other
sweet
malts
the
smell
is
pleasant
and
enjoyable
the
taste
is
of
some
bread
malts
and
some
caramel
and
some
other
sweet
malts
the
taste
however
is
slightly
watery
and
doesnt
pack
as
much
a
punch
as
i
hoped
for
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
very
lightly
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
okay
the
first
two
i
thought
it
was
very
drinkable
however
on
the
third
the
flaws
were
more
present
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
off
white
head
that
diminishes
pretty
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
the
aroma
gives
off
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
in
conjunction
with
the
lagery
esters
its
better
than
bad
the
taste
delivers
on
the
sweet
malt
right
up
front
with
a
bit
of
breadiness
as
well
the
light
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
make
this
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
a
nice
intro
beer
this
beer
is
light
enough
for
a
session
but
the
lack
of
any
defining
characteristics
left
me
disappointed
overall
this
is
very
close
to
bud
american
ale
and
twice
the
price
while
i
am
happy
that
leinenkugel
is
doing
real
beers
this
one
just
isnt
that
good
overall
not
anything
i
expected
ive
never
liked
leinenkugel
brews
and
i
thought
this
one
might
change
my
mind
but
im
once
again
left
dissapointed
leinenkugels
classic
amber
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
i
get
mostly
malt
in
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
doesnt
smell
especially
hoppy
the
flavor
is
malty
i
get
some
biscuit
like
flavors
there
is
some
bitterness
but
the
hops
really
are
in
the
background
mostly
just
adding
balance
decent
sessionable
beer
this
is
light
and
drinkable
its
not
great
but
its
not
bad
its
decent
but
dont
expect
more
out
of
this
not
bad
a
decent
no
frills
beer
drinkability
is
good
but
one
could
find
a
better
beer
still
quite
quaffable
d
not
a
bad
no
nonsense
drinker
id
even
grab
a
sixer
at
a
lessthan
stellar
sale
i
opted
for
a
case
after
the
first
2
99
sixpack
sorry
chaingangguy
overall
a
pretty
mellow
average
beer
a
good
amount
of
malt
presence
coppery
taste
a
too
sweet
and
bland
malty
finish
for
my
liking
i
will
not
seek
this
beer
out
again
this
beer
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
tasty
this
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
session
i
personally
would
not
but
could
see
how
others
would
drinkability
while
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
it
is
terribly
basic
generic
and
simple
one
and
done
for
me
d
drinks
like
an
adjunct
amber
with
a
bad
tart
fizzy
orange
soda
like
quality
with
a
weak
watery
hop
presence
makes
this
a
big
pass
only
gets
worse
progressively
while
you
drinking
honestly
found
this
to
be
a
defamation
of
character
against
all
american
ambers
better
suited
as
a
drain
cleaner
drinkability
this
would
be
a
very
respectable
everyday
lager
perhaps
the
best
leinies
i
have
had
d
easy
to
drink
theres
just
nothing
really
exciting
going
on
here
not
bad
but
not
good
something
a
bit
off
here
i
suppose
they
tried
to
give
it
a
more
modern
twist
on
a
classic
style
but
came
up
with
a
sweet
and
bitter
brew
that
is
mediocreish
overall
not
bad
but
not
too
good
either
we
are
so
deprived
here
in
ms
but
i
got
excited
when
i
saw
this
leiney
offering
ive
spent
many
summers
in
chippewa
falls
and
have
been
through
that
brewery
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
overall
product
it
has
a
nice
orangybrown
color
and
you
could
smell
the
hops
rather
nicely
but
to
me
it
seemed
like
an
almost
caramel
taste
that
was
overpowering
and
a
rather
strong
smoky
aftertaste
guess
ill
just
have
to
stick
with
my
sam
adams
for
now
bits
of
doughy
malt
in
the
aroma
light
and
subtle
taste
is
along
those
lines
also
with
a
nice
balance
of
spicy
hop
in
the
finish
nothing
outstanding
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
fits
the
leiny
style
of
beers
cheaper
beers
just
across
the
craft
border
from
bmc
land
d
nothing
real
great
or
real
bad
about
this
beer
it
did
not
impress
me
and
it
finishes
a
bit
to
bitter
and
dry
for
what
i
want
out
of
an
amber
ale
cost
was
cheap
and
makes
it
seem
worth
it
mouthfeeldrinkabilityoverall
medium
carbonation
slight
tangy
sensation
on
the
tongue
kinda
speads

pretty
good
drinkablity
half
way
thru
my
first
one
i
felt
that
i
could
have
5
of
these
comfortably
but
when
i
finished
my
3rd
i
changed
my
mind
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
has
some
potential
to
be
better
i
typically
agree
with
the
assertion
that
leinenkugels
makes
a
great
bridge
to
the
world
of
craft
beers
this
beer
is
somewhat
in
line
with
this
reasoning
its
good
but
not
great
the
flavor
and
balance
are
good
but
theres
nothing
that
really
stands
out
as
exceptional
however
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
its
simple
but
its
worth
trying
notes
refreshing
after
a
hot
day
not
exciting
but
a
good
solid
amber
d
just
alright
drink
it
in
a
pinch
but
not
a
standout
the
taste
runs
a
little
thin
and
lacks
character

to
me

my

of

the

2
thumbs
down
for
this

copper
colored
with
a
puffy
white
head
that
lasts
awhile
and
leaves
a
few
blobs
of
airy
foam
behind
toasted
grain
and
mild
leafy
hops
make
up
the
nose
sweet
malt
with
just
enough
hop
bittering
to
balance
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
easy
enough
to
drink
at
least
there
are
no
berries
in
this
one
light
to
medium
bodied
a
decent
amber
pours
a
very
light
copper
color
not
as
deep
as
i
like
but
the
huge
head
and
bubbles
help
as
well
as
the
decent
lacing
malty
scent
very
sweet
with
that
slight
skunky
aroma
you
get
from
macro
lagers
nice
flavor
extremely
sweet
mostly
malt
with
just
a
slight
hop
bite
and
a
slight
skunkiness
at
the
end
very
bubbly
but
not
rough
goes
down
fine
if
overly
sweet
on
tap
at
a
local
watering
hole
came
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
chill
hazed
lighter
shade
of
amber
with
a
thinner
white
head
muted
aromas
just
a
hint
of
toasted
grain
and
a
passing
whif
of
caramel
standard
amber
lager
flavors
toasted
with
some
sweeter
caramelthis
just
have
a
slight
bite
in
the
finish
like
an
herbal
smack
but
its
still
par
for
the
course
not
anything
to
write
home
aboutits
standard
and
rather
blah
d
makes
for
a
pretty
decent
sessionable
lager
good
buy
for
a
party
if
you
want
to
have
something
more
than
bmc
but
dont
want
to
break
the
bank
i
dont
seem
to
have
much
luck
with
leinies
brews
however
i
would
take
this
over
a
bud
in
a
heartbeat
i
was
excited
to
see
a
different
amber
lager
around
but
its
not
up
to
par
for
me
not
a
very
good
beer
at
all
not
a
dumper
with
weak
hop
character
metallic
finish
it
lists
four
different
hops
on
the
bottle
some
of
the
flavor
is
too
artificial
to
be
very
drinkable
reviewed
first
as
the
place
was
too
noisy
and
crowded
to
take
notes
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
light
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
hint
of
amber
malt
then
slight
hops
im
sorry
to
say
the
amber
light
is
a
superior
beer
to
this
one
unfortunate
that
this
is
the
taste
of
leinenkugels
that
most
will
encounter
its
just
pretty
boring

with

here
there
is
too
much
packaged
over
pricing
on
this
one
if
this
were
a
few
dollars
cheaper
it
would
be
worth
picking
up
now
and
then
purchased
at
brunos
at
the
summit
in
birmingham
nice
amber
color
to
this
one
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
smells
malty
with
very
little
hops
coming
through
the
taste
is
exactly
the
same
while
malty
and
decently
flavored
there
are
not
many
hops
present
at
all
i
would
not
be
quite
as
harsh
in
my
review
if
the
label
hadnt
proclaimed
4
kind
of
hops
inside
i
just
cant
find
them
on
a
brighter
note
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
sessionable
still
better
than
most
big
macro
brews
drinkable
average
brew
im
not
going
to
detail
every
aspect
of
this
new
flavor
of
leinies
its
been
reported
that
this
beer
is
being
slotted
by
leinies
as
competition
against
sam
adams
on
the
national
scale
i
found
it
to
be
very
generic
for
a
micro
or
niche
brew
flavors
ok
nothing
outstanding
drinkable
to
me
though
its
just
beer
also
this
is
categorized
wrong
its
a
lager
not
an
ale
and
i
graded
it
as
such
d
this
is
by
no
means
the
best
amber
ale
around
but
it
is
very
easydrinking
and
sessionable
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
would
be
a
good
crossover
beer
for
just
about
anyone
its
not
geeky
but
is
well
made
with
no
obvious
flaws
or
shortcomings
d
easy
to
drink
abv
is
manageable
and
the
flavors
are
light
carbonation
is
a
downside
here
as
i
feel
it
becoming
very
filling
and
bothersome
to
the
mouth
pours
a
pale
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
large
off
white
head
bubbles
form
quickly
and
collar
of
lace
is
left
in
thin
uneven
formations
aromatics
offer
up
a
mildly
sweet
light
toasted
malt
character
with
just
a
kiss
of
citrus
hops
flavor
is
quite
disappointing
same
leinenkugel
generic
craft
brew
flavor
some
sweet
malts
divide
with
a
touch
of
herbal
and
citrus
hops
100
percent
malt
with
actual
hop
character
lets
kick
this
up
a
few
notches
and
do
away
with
the
leine
yeast
strain
defnitely
unoffensive
in
every
way
body
is
extremely
light
and
somewhat
fizzy
but
not
cloyingly
so
goes
down
smooth
pretty
effortlessly
it
just
hits
as
more
of
the
same
i
think
this
is
a
winner
from
leinenkugels
btw
head
retention
was
above
average
and
theres
some
lacing
wow
not
very
impressed
after
the
local
hype
on
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
i
guess
leinenkugel
wants
me
to
believe
classic
amber
is
actually
gold
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
the
same
generic
caramel
malt
that
is
present
in
most
of
leinies
beers
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
this
beer
tastes
very
similar
to
leinies
other
beers
dull
would
be
a
good
word
to
describe
it
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
i
was
hoping
for
more
than
what
i
got
i
decided
that
the
beer
would
be
a
better
one
i
really
like
liene
beers
they
are
pretty
good
the
summer
brew
is
one
of
the
great
beers
that
i
have
had
i
really
would
like
to
try
the
different
beers
that
are
offered
by
lieni
i
am
sure
it
would
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
another
fairly
good
interesting
beer
from
the
north
woods
nice
deep
amber
color
one
of
my
favorite
lakefront
beers
great
from
the
bottle
even
better
from
the
tap
pretty
good
nice
and
sweet
beer
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
aroma
suggests
with
a
good
caramel
malty
note
with
a
slight
peppery
bitterness
definitely
not
an
overly
sweet
maltiness
if
you
want
to
enjoy
it
id
suggest
doing
at
least
two
in
a
row
one
is
good
if
youre
just
enjoying
a
brew
with
a
meal
but
to
get
the
full
flavor
id
take
few
along
for
the
ride
so
they
dont
get
lonely
and
you
get
a
good
taste
i
dont
know
if
its
a
great
stein
beer
but
it
is
still
fun
to
drink
in
one
tasted
this
at
the
brewery
great
nuttiness
light
coffee
notes
balanced
yummy
overall
very
well
done
and
enjoyable
should
pair
well
with
many
foods
picked
this
one
up
at
super
sub
and
six
pack
in
dubois
pa
while
on
trip
never
seen
it
and
do
not
anything
about
lakefront
but
figured
worth
a
try
very
surprising
good
looking
beer
that
offers
very
little
to
the
nose
but
oh
so
tasty
very
good
not
sure
if
i
will
ever
see
this
again
but
i
hope
so
overall
i
put
down
three
full
solo
cups
of
this
one
its
a
marvelously
drinkable
beer
that
paired
excellent
with
the
pulled
pork
barbecue
that
was
being
served
at
the
party
would
highly
recommend
for
craft
lager
lovers
or
new
converts
to
craft
beer
as
it
is
an
approachable
style
for
all
beer
drinkers
and
one
that
really
hits
the
style
on
the
head
would
recommend
overall
a
good
american
red
lager
here
from
lakefront
that
would
not
be
out
of
place
in
my
fridge
malty
bready
lager
beer
that
drinks
easy
and
has
pretty
solid
flavors
the
beer
is
dark
copper
with
a
mild
haze
and
sports
a
half
inch
off
offwhite
head
the
aroma
bring
caramel
malt
bread
grain
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
mild
alcohol
perhaps
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
flavor
with
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
pretty
drinkable
though
the
beer
itself
is
rather
bland
and
uneventful
ok
o
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
lakefront
a
definite
go
to
beer
after
a
long
day
very
unique
flavor
cant

it
is
worth

a

that

it
was
advertised
as
an

on

i
was
pleasantly

to
get
a

to
the

mouthfeel
is
light

this

taste
with
a
great
finish
cant
really
describe
it
other
than
you
just
have
that
great
feeling
overall
a
very
good
beer
paired
this
with
a

it

beer
is
medium

mediumheavy
in
body
surprisingly
with
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
leading
to
a
smooth
though
somewhat
placid
mouthfeel
some
more
carbonation
would
fit
this
beer
and
accentuate
the
aromas
and
move
it
more
prominently
across
the
palate
closes
semidry
with
substantial
stickiness

copper

some
of
which
sticks
around
for
a
bit
the
nose
is
musty
and
astringent
not
a
good
start
the
malt
flavors
are
easily
discernible
in
this
hearty
beer
the
finish
dries
out
a
bit
but
there
is
also
a
hint
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
at
the
very
back
end
this
offering
has
a
unique
flavor
that
i
enjoyed
however
taken
as
a
whole
package
this
beer
is
mediocre
holy
hell
this
if
absolutely
fantastic
why
have
i
not
been
buying
cases
of
this
o
the
ol
go
to
beer
in
these
parts
of
the
mke
where
every
bar
carrys
bmc
and
lf
while
i
think
its
a
good
easy
drinking
amber
lager
id
like
some
hop
character
to
come
through
in
this
beer
between
riverwest
and
east
side
dark
i
prefer
the
east
side
dark
i
know
i
know
they
are
totally
different
beers
but
most
carry
rw
over
esd
not
sure
why
beautiful
dark
copper
color
lots
of
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
but
with
a
hop
bit
at
first
taste
that
yields
to
a
sweet
slightly
citrusy
body
extraordinary
good
mouthfeel
that
finishes
as
smooth
as
any
lager
ive
ever
had
a
big
surprise
and
a
great
beer
o
a
refreshing
yet
somewhat
substantial
lager
that
would
pair
well
with
german
sausages
and
sauerkraut
pours
a
clear
bubbly
deep
amber
red
nice
inch
deep
off
white
head
and
notchy
lacing
sweet
and
bready
smell
with
some
floral
and
piney
citrus
hop
smells
this
is
just
a
really
nice
balanced
flavorful
beer
its
biscuty
and
malty
in
the
begining
this
gives
way
to
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
flavors
there
is
not
a
huge
hop
presance
but
some
bitter
pine
and
citrus
hoppy
notes
come
out
all
this
is
held
together
by
an
awesome
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
drinkable
there
is
nothing
here
that
will
wow
anyone
its
just
a
well
made
pefectly
balanced
red
really
nice
beer
flavors
and
very
easy
drinking
overall
a
lot
going
on
easy
to
drink
and
it
leaves
me
wanting
to
have
another
o
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
really
distinctive
in
the
flavor
profile
its
a
little
too
heavy
to
be
a
hot
weather
beer
or
anything
id
want
to
quaff
out
of
a
full
stein
would
likely
be
a
delicious
pairing
for
beer
cheese
soup
beer
bread
or
food
in
general
drinking
standalone
isnt
the
best
experience
though
this
beer
has
been
around
for
quite
a
while
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
an
outstanding
example
of
a
viennastyle
lager
its
too
bad
a
lot
of
beer
advocates
shun
this
style
and
gravitate
towards
more
hoppy
and
extreme
beers
i
love
vienna
lagers
and
go
back
to
them
often
no
other
beer
complements
food
like
these
do
this
one
does
just
fine
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
decent
looking
amber
colored
brew
the
head
was
white
and
fizzy
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
of
some
lager
yeast
aromas
as
well
as
some
hops
and
malts
all
seemed
pretty
well
balanced
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
nice
it
was
earthy
and
crisp
with
a
sweetness
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
i
thought
for
a
lager
it
was
drinkable
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
the
beer
wasnt
anything
too
special
to
me
but
still
was
nice
to
try
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
at
a
backyard
bbq
i
was
even
more
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
found
it
at
my
local
beer
store
on
tap
its
a
very
good
summer
beer
for
a
malt
lover
not
sure
the
bottle
version
is
quite
as
good
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
reviewing
process
it
gave
me
a
better
appreciation
for
what
is
really
in
this
beer
a
complex
amber
lager
that
should
be
enjoyed
thoroughly
o
lakefronts
flagship
beer
riverwest
is
an
easydrinking
amber
lager
thats
got
the
malt
and
hop
balance
down
pat
if
you
like
your
lagers
malty
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
this
utterly
smooth
lager
is
for
you
o
overallthis
is
a
good
amber
overall
o
very
drinkable
an
extremely
attractive
beer
color
head
lacing
very
flavorful
leaves
a
good
taste
in
your
mouth
long
after
youre
done
o
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
nothing
really
special
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
but
not
sure
it
is
one
i
really
want
to
get
again
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
it
is
really
good
with
my
one
complaint
being
i
wish
the
finish
was
a
little
crisper
besides
that
a
pretty
outstanding
beer
o
hops
were
relatively
absent
nice
complexity
to
its
malt
but
a
little
to
off
balance
still
clean
and
a
nice
lager
well
done

is
a

not
inyourface
but
also
letting
you
know
youve
got
something
outoftheordinary
in
your
glass
the
amber
lager
is
a
catchall
style
for
ba
but
dont
mistake
this
for
leinies
red
vatech
hop
head
you
need
to
find
some
fresher
stock
looks
and
smells
like
an
amber
lager
or
red
ale
but
after
one
sip
there
is
definitely
something
wrong
with
this
one
it
tastes
like
a
hard
apple
cider
or
faint
farmhouse
ale
dont
know
if
something
went
wrong
or
is
infected
but
this
one
is
way
off
the
style
guidelines
not
worth
reviewing
in
my
mind
avoid
a
decent
enough
amber
lager
or
stein
beer
i
suppose
but
the
bar
is
pretty
freaking
low
for
that
style
around
here
so
i
guess
i
gotta
say
something
sorta
nice
about
this
here
offering
uh
nope
i
got
nothing
just
an
adequately
balanced
good
to
go
brew
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
gives
me
a
little
hope
for
the
rest
of
my
mixed
pack
thats
been
pretty
basic
to
this
point
nice
earthy
amber
lager
that
hits
the
right
notes
including
a
long
finish
the
beer
is
just
right
for
the
fall
with
a
big
malt
backbone
to
anchor
everything
i
like
the
way
this
brewery
manages
to
brew
both
decent
ales
and
lagers
and
maintains
a
wide
range
of
styles
though
drinkability
seems
high
on
the
list
rather
than
cutting
edge
very
good
example
of
the
style
the
smell
is
nice
a
little
roastier
than
i
like
this
is
one
red
i
would
maybe
have
again
i
am
swinging
through
milwaukee
next
month
so
i
might
seek
this
out
on
tap
m
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
good
mouth
coating
on
tap
at
the
brewery
a
nice
drinkability
to
this
orange
body
and
soapy
head
spicy
pepper
and
clove
and
nutmeg
above
average
mouthfeel
hoppy
grapefruit
chops
good
malting
with
caramel
good
amber
decent
balance
just
not
the
greatest
drinker
for
me
wanted
something
edgier
the
body
is
medium
but
seems
a
little
shallow
almost
thin
and
spritzy
at
first
warming
just
a
little
seems
to
help
quite
a
bit
though
as
it
fills
in
and
goes
smooth
and
creamy
nice
appearing
medium
amber
with
persistent
white
foam

fairly
nondescript

that
is

extra
points

drinkability
but
is

middling

not

bad
beer
average
rate
of

though
it
did
start
to
lose
its
originally
luster
a

more
then
middrink
small
flashes
of
promise
mixes
more
so
with
average
regards
makes
me
a
fence
sitter
on
this
one
o
nowhere
near
as
delicious
as
the
cherry
lager
o
this
is
a
solid
brew
and
i
felt
that
pairing
it
with
the
bacon
cheeseburger
and
bottomless
fries
was
an
excellent
choice
o
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
quite
sessionable
pours

a

if
you
will

mild
bitterness
on
the

after
each
sip
there
is
a
good
carbonation

with
a
crisp

clean

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
bready
aroma
and
taste
reminds
me
of
a
fat
tire
variant
this
is
a
very
nice
amber
that
lakefront
has
put
together
it
has
stellar
balance
between
the
hops
and
malts
that
makes
it
dangerously
drinkableyou
hardly
notice
that
youve
just
put
away
three
pints
while
talking
about
the
politics
surrounding
the
wisconsin
state
budget
or
whether
the
packers
will
get
a
chance
to
repeat
this
year
while
its
a
favorite
of
the
milwaukee
hipsters
this
is
an
amber
for
all
people
and
should
not
be
missed
very
light
bodied
but
it
is
a
lager
would
be
better
a
bit
heavier
but
this
way
is
quite
refreshing
a
bit
maltier
and
sweeter
than
it
is
hoppier
clean
refreshing
this
one

a

the
mouthfeel

and
goes
down
easily
overall
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
to
offer
over
some
cheaper
alternatives
o
a
nice
amber
lager
id
pour
another
one
for
sure
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
really
special
about
it
either
easy
to
drink
a
decent
representative
of
the
amber
style
overall
though
it
lacks
the
real
depth
of
character
and
malt
complexities
of
the
finer
examples
its
still
suitable
as
a
mild
easydrinking
lager
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a

that
leaves

to
be

from
the
label
on

bottle
reading
all
malt
has
a
really
good
taste
to
it
that
is
very
well
mixed
very
malty
but
also
has
some
nut
hints
and
sweet
carmel
leaves
a
good
after
taste
a
very
tasty
and
well
made
red
lager
overall
another
tasty
brew
from
lakefront
well
done
amber
lager
another
revisiting
of
an
old
summerfest

peel
the
taste
amps
the
caramel
up
just
a
bit
increases
the
orange
peel
and
then
adds
a
bit
of
orange
flesh
to
the
proceedings
as
well
near
the
end
the
caramel
toasts
itself
or
somehow
becomes
toasted
whichever
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
amber
something
pleasant
enough
to
stroll
around
summerfest
with
dthis
is
a
really
excellent
sessionable
brew
i
recommend
this
one
for
sure
and
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
light
easy

overall
a

i
could
picture

one
holding
well
against
any
german
oktoberfest
beer

with
just
a
little

how
soft
they
are
because
this
one
jarred
me
a
little
from
my
expectations
which
i
suppose
isnt
always
a
bad
thing
overall
impression
id
never
consider
this
a
goto
but
for
what
it
is
a
damned
drinkable
brew
and
well
worth
a
try
overall
for
the
style
i
think
they
did
very
well
im
not
sure
how
i
feeling
about
some
of
the
flavor
sensations
i
got
for
my
personal
tastes
this
created
some
unique
aromas
and
tastes
that
are
not
found
in
other
styles
a
very
good
amber
it
smells
sweeter
than
it
tastes
the
hops
compliment
the
malt
beautifully
very
balanced
clear
light
amber
body
minimal
rising
carbonation
with
12
finger
offwhite
head
quick
dissipation
resulting
in
an
uneven
thin
sheet
of
head
nose
features
big
maltiness
some
roast
re
hot
rocks
sweet
and
either
pilsener
or
munich
for
smoothness
a
wee
bit
of
floral
hops
on
back
end
taste
mirrors
nose
more
malty
than
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
on
back
end
but
not
very
much
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
minimal
effervescence
drinkability
is
ok
but
nothing
special
and
not
all
that
tasty
a
strong
amber
lager
with
individualism
worth
trying
again
well
balanced
and
flavorful
this
was
excellent
and
really
surprised
me
drinks
more
like
an
ale
than
a
lager
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
sure
enough
that
makes
this
easy
to
enjoy
and
i
hardly
noticed
the
abv
in
this
for
the
summer
this
wont
take
the
place
of
a
wheat
beer
but
i
could
have
seen
myself
enjoying
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
time
i
enjoyed
this
and
it
made
for
a
pleasant
surprise
since
i
havent
had
too
many
beers
in
this
style
worth
a
try
once
for
those
willing
to
go
outside
of
their
boundaries
a
wee
bit
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
be
careful
on
the
pour
d
good
give
me
more
this
is
something
new
to
my
tastebuds
but
nothing
special
decent
taste
but
thats
it
worth
skipping
that
trait
is
caramel
butteryness
its
what
i
always
used
to
say
was
diacetyl
but
what
i
now
know
is
sometimes
intentional
its
usually
used
when
intentionally
used
to
middling
effect
but
here
it
mixes
with
a
kind
of
dry
riverwater
maltiness
and
rounds
everything
out
into
a
beer
that
jibes
together
differently
that
works
in
way
ive
never
seen
a
beer
work
before
md
thick
and
creamy
the
taste
makes
it
a
i
wont
buy
this
ever
again
beer
for
me
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
my
first
lakefront
offering
and
was
really
let
down
this
is
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
reach
for
again
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
most
interesting
beer
certainly
worthy
although
im
not
sure
id
have
it
often
i
keep
wanting
to
drop
down
one
or
more
of
these
scores
towards
average
but
frankly
this
is
a
really
solid
above
average
amber
lager
no
flaws
no
truly
defining
characteristic
but
something
i
would
have
loved
early
in
my
craft
drinking
career
and
something
i
could
easily
toss
back
a
few
pints
of
today
also
nothing
im
seeking
out
but
thats
the
style
not
the
beer
d
it
would
be
hard
to
find
this
one
again
and
the
label
is
so
average
i
would
probably
pass
right
by
without
noticing
very
drinkable
for
the
style
the
beer
fares
much
better
as
an
english
pale
but
even
then
the
malts
are
too
simplistic
and
too
caramelly
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
if
you
like
your
vienna
lagers
as
an
ale
d
an
ok
amber
ale
some
nice
caramel
and
bready
malts
in
the
smell
and
taste
color
is
what
youd
expect
amberred
carbonation
is
almost
white
and
there
was
good
head
the
aroma
was
very
faint
and
the
flavor
is
ok
but
nothing
outstanding
an
easydrinking
wellbalanced
enjoyable
amber
lager
this
beer
is
a
light
amber
in
color
almost
golden
the
aroma
is
almost
flowery
and
sweet
the
taste
starts
with
a
light
sweetness
and
carbonation
and
the
sweet
flower
smell
prevail
in
the
taste
it
finishes
dry
with
no
bitter
i
think
if
you
have
a
girlfriend
who
doesnt
like
beer
have
her
try
this
the
light
body
and
smooth
taste
make
this
an
easy
beer
to
approach
but
unlike
many
beer
in
this
style
it
is
full
flavored
mouthfeel
good
dynamic
between
the
light
aftertaste
on
the
palate
and
the
surge
you
get
initially
very
affordable
round
town
the
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
carbonation
level
is
lowtomoderate
eases
consumption
for
sure
the
flavors
on
this
along
with
the
aftertaste
really
remind
me
of
a
marzenofest
big
malt
presence
mild
caramel
flavoring
light
hops
and
the
finish
is
very
doughy
and
bready
light
ethanol
taste
on
the
backend
as
well
again
lakefront
has
made
another
great
beer
i
am
super
excited
to
try
the
other
4
offerings
andy
sent
my
way
thanks
again
for
the
trade
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
the
alcohol
content
is
just
right
for
this
brew
allowing
me
to
share
the
growler
over
the
afternoon
and
enjoying
every
bit
of
it

this
one
hits
the
spot
pretty
well
da
nice
drinkable
beer
which
does
meet
the
style
more
than
it
doesnt
i
will
have
this
one
again
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
would
make
for
a
session
beer
this
one
wont
cause
too
much
palate
fatigue
because
there
really
is
only
one
dominant
flavor
m
this
beer
has
a
mediumfull
mouthfeel
with
a
fizzy
finish
d
this
beer
has
no
real
off
flavors
but
it
doesnt
really
have
any
other
flavors
either
pours
a
clear

with
a
slight
offwhite

has
a
tint

is
a
very
welcoming
mix
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
much
more
going
on
with
this
aroma
than
i
was
anticipating
for
a
lager
also
detecting
a
bit
of
caramel
notes
in
the
smell
taste
a
nice
blend
of
malt
sweetness
upfront
and
a
touch
of

malty
taste
is
of
malts
and
somewhat
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in

mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
worth
checking
out
got
this
as
a
try
this
from
a
guy
at
work
havent
had
anything
else
from
this
brewery
but
am
looking
forward
to
giving
more
of
them
a
try
it
is
amazing
to
me
how
many
ambers
there
are
out
there
that
just
dont
live
up
to
the
perception
many
are
too
thin
or
over
the
edge
on
hops
an
amber
to
me
is
not
just
a
color
or
a
strong
version
of
a
lager
they
have
a
different
and
better
profile
this
is
a
pretty
well
done
amber
d
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
one
after
another
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
norm
but
not
out
of
the
ordinary
a
solid
all
around
beer
that
has
something
to
offer
very
nice
beer
as
ive
stated
i
love
this
beer
its
on
tap
all
over
town
so
getting
my
fix
is
rather
easy
ive
been
lucky
to
have
been
to
a
couple
weddings
at
the
brewery
where
you
can
basically
lay
down
under
the
tap
homer
simpson
style
free
of
charge
all
night
i
love
this
town
delicious
lager
well
built
strong
malts
creamy
texture
good
nose
seems
to
bea
bit
hoppier
than
past
years
but
still
one
of
the
best
from
milwaukee
great
brewery
tour
also
with
a
great

however
there

is
turning
many
heads
and
is
a
great
light
summer
beer
3
5
not
too
bad
though
the
tang
is
a
bit
much
would
not
seek
out
but
the
more
i
drink
the
more
it
cajoles
me
into
drinking
it
drinkability
is
ok
not
a
beer
i
would
pick
up
again
though
notes
a
really
good
beer
for
sessions
well
balanced
and
so
creamy
this
has
got
to
be
a
very
popular
beer
at
lakefront
its
got
the
perfect
characteristics
for
a
nice
crossover
beer
first
off
its
a
lager
so
theres
some
common
ground
already
secondly
its
very
balanced
yet
its
actually
got
some
color
from
malts
and
flavor
from
hops
but
the
key
here
is
balance
with
that
hop
profile
pours
an
amber
with
an
orange
glow
when
held
toward
the
light
head
is
light
cream
and
forms
nicely

broken
up

unevenly
strewn

after
a
few
sips
drinkability
overall
is
by
the
stein
im
not
sure
how
this
is
served
in
milwaukee
but
its
defniitely
suitable
for
at
least
a
12
liter
krug
or
stein
enjoyed
on
tap
at
miller

from
a
compostable

balanced
between
sweet

and

good
amount

beer
tasted
sweet
with
a
slight
nuttiness

faint

drinkability
it
was
the
perfect
fullflavored
beer
to
have
while
watching
a
baseball
game
pours
a
beautiful
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
very
thick
if
not
too
persistent
head
the
bottle
foamed
like
nobodys
business
so
i
had
to
grab
a
bath
towel
or
get
a
lapful
of
beer
aroma
is
quite
strong
and
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
malty
not
complex
but
pleasing
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness

is
smooth
and
lively

quite
a
tingle

and
a
rusty

malts
with
a
little
bit

much
like
the
smell
good
bitterness
to
wrap
up
the
experience
real
nice
mouthfeel
thanks
to
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
feel
is
milky
and
smooth
as
silk
chocolate
milk
on
the
tail
end
this
is
the
best
lakefront
beer
i
have
had
thus
far
rich
smoothy
nutty
drinkability
a
rather
flavorful
lager
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
again
but
it
was
a
cut
above
the
standards
for
the
category
pours
a
clear
amberorange
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
grass
and
some
yeast
cleanliness
fits
the
style
of
an
american
amber
red
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
up
front
then
grass
then
slight
earthy
malt
and
some
yeast
cleanliness
in
the
finish
overall
a
little
lacking
in
body
for
what
i
was
expecting
a
decent
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
fluffy
light
ecru
foam
aroma
and
flavor
are
of
sweet
caramelized
malts
medium
toasted
grains
grassy
earthy
bitter
hops
this
red
ale
is
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
for
its
style
worth
a
try
if
you
stumble
upon
it
overall
i
do
think
this
is
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
search
it
out
but
im
glad
i
had
it
and
will
enjoy
the
one
i
have
i
do
think
the
blend
of
tastes
and
mouthfeel
make
worth
trying
easy
drinking
easy
forgetting
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
good
amount
of
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
one
finger
of
beige
foam
that
retained
quite
well
and
left
lacing
in
sheets
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
tart
with
sour
malty
notes
citrus
toasted
malt
and
sweet
spices
the
flavors
were
of
toasted
malt
punctuated
by
a
slight
citrus
sourness
with
some
nutty
elements
similar
to
a
bock
beer
with
a
nice
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
rough
at
first
but
softer
after
it
had
a
chance
to
breath
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
a
bit
too
high
drinkability
when
i
say
that
this
is
becoming
my
go
to
beer
i
really
mean
that
this
is
becoming
a
session
beer
for
me
d
other
then
the
smell
and
lack
of
head
not
a
bad
brew
consistent
put
together
taste
could
drink
a
few
of
these
riverwest
stein
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
at
first
it
reminded
me
a
little
of
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
a
bit
more
smooth
and
subdued
i
like
this
pick
for
a
weekend
hanging
out
with
my
friends
i
could
easily
drink
this
one
all
night
long
and
be
happy
for
doing
so
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
flavorful
session
beer
with
some
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
this
is
a
fairly
hearty
lager
at
first
i
felt
it
was
a
bit
thin
but
given
time
to
sip
on
this
one
i
find
it
quite
satisfying
i
would
surely
drink
another
d
one
of
a
sampler
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
box
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
couldnt
quite
get
a
read
on
with
the
slight
sourness
that
crept
in
d
average
this
was
a
very
basic
malt
based
beer
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
its
a
mediocre
malt
beer
not
an
instant
classic
but
it
definitely
grew
on
me
as
the
glass
got
lower
the
flavors
melded
better
as
it
got
warmer
as
well
d
a
fair
beer
from
lakefront
i
really
didnt
like
it
but
i
didnt
hate
it
either
drinkable
but
i
dont
see
myself
getting
this
again
a
good
solid
example
of
the
style
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
good
solid
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
having
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
were
available
good
job
overall
its
not
perfect
but
somehow
i
love
it
the
dms
is
distracting
perhaps
it
is
intentional
or
i
got
a
bad
batch
i
enjoy
the
balance
of
toasty
and
grainy
malt
against
the
wide
spectrum
of
hop
flavors
no
doubt
due
to
the
use
of
at
least
three
different
hops
quite
spicy
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
beers
vaguely
comparable
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
without
caramel
and
not
the
same
hop
flavor
if
you
like
sam
adams
you
might
like
this
if
lakefront
is
reading
this
i
think
this
beer
might
benefit
from
the
addition
of
a
bit
of
rye
malt
to
help
smooth
it
out
just
a
thought
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
hops
balance
the
malt
very
well
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
good
for
style
a
decent
session
brew
quite
full
flavored
for
the
style
not
to
bad
i
found
the
more
i
drank
of
this
the
more
it
started
to
grow
on
me
pretty
solid
amber
drinkability
nice
session
beer
here
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
malty
brew
this
is
a
good
one
to
have
overall
a
decent
beer
though
the
malt
sweetness
would
catch
up
with
me
after
the
second
one
i
do
believe
two
of
the
last
three
sixers
of
this
i
have
bought
have
been
disappointing
this
is
my
one
of
my
favorite
beers
on
tap
bottled
last
week
of
august
so
beer
is
about
6
weeks
old
deep
dark
chestnut
color
nice
head
and
lacing
smells
moderately
malty
with
a
touch
of
skunk
taste
is
not
as
malty
or
roasty
as
i
remember
finishes
like
heineken
not
much
but
just
a
hint
of
skunk
mouthfeel
okay
nice
and
carbed
i
really
hope
lakefront
works
on
its
consistency
or
my
hometown
brew
will
go
back
to
sprecher
nothing
special
maybe
a
criticism
it
seems
to
be
a
little
alelike
for
a
lager
maybe
thats
why
i
like
it
drinkability
is
fairly
high
easily
sessionable
and
the
flavors
are
decent
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
amber
lager
surprisingly
hoppy
for
a
lager
this
beer
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
decent
head
and
a
lacing
that
lingered
the
smell
was
probably
the
weakest
part
of
the
beer
with
there
being
some
malts
and
maybe
a
little
fruity
the
taste
was
real
malty
and
the
mouthfeel
was
great
because
it
was
just
so
silky
creamy
and
smooth
the
drinkability
was
also
very
nice
i
had
two
bottles
and
i
still
wanted
more
taste
has
a
decent
malt
backbone
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
smooth
and
creamy
texture
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
buttery
slickness
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
the
taste
is
toasty
bread
crust
some
pine
hints
of
caramel
citrus
herbs
and
butter
the
starts
is
sweet
followed
by
increasing
faintly
spicy
light
bitterness
its
light
and
smooth
but
remains
flavourful
and
interesting

bit
of

biscuity
with
strong
caramel
and
chocolate
medium

actually
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
pretty
damn
drinkable
one
of
this
brewerys
better
offerings
imo
nice
tasty
brew
my
first
from

but
just
a
soso
mouthfeel

drink
and
review
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
amber
color
with
an
average
tan
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
weak
the
taste
is
buttery
tea
like
malt
slight
lemon
flavor
no
offputting
flavors
just
nothing
exciting
the
feel
is
light
almost
watery
thin
carbonation
with
a
sweettea
like
finish
an
average
brew
at
best
no
offputting
flavors
but
no
good
characteristics
easy
drinking
yes
but
not
worth
remembering
definitely
better
amber
lagers
out
there
d
pretty
high
i
would
have
another
if
i
could
i
recommend
it
would
pair
nicely
with
red
meat
d
a

you
really
cant
go

will

with

sessionable

one
of
my
favorite
hometown
brews
dsomething
doesnt
fly
with
me
im
not
a
fan
i
picked
this
beer
up
in
a
sampler
case
with
8
different
beers
i
wasnt
disappointed
with
any
of
them
and
if
given
the
opportunity
to
drink
any
of
these
beers
again
im
taking
it
d
easily
drinkable
with
a
nice
balanced
malt
character
a
good
beer
overall
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
efforts
from
lakefront
very
drinkable
nothing
bad
to
say
here
a
great
after
dinnerwork
beer
that
brings
a
medium
to
the
playing
ground
between
the
thick
porterstouts
and
the
lighter
ales
with
its
own
balance
between
malts
and
hops
drinkability
a
good
easy
drinking
fest
like
beer
i
like
swilling
this
from
my
mug
abv
is
a
little
high
which
keeps
this
from
sessionable
but
still
enjoyable
definately
worth
trying
i
would
buy
this
again
only
the
faintest
slickness
an
unexpected
byproduct
for
this
style
that
holds
it
back
from
perfection
this
is
the
very
definition
of
drinkable
who
needs
germany
when
we
have
wisconsin
d
an
easy
drinking
lager
light
flavors
as
expected
from
a
lager
but
ive
had
more
robust
red
lagers
winter
skal
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
why
i
wouldnt
want
another
one
though
i
can
tell
this
was
made
for
maximum
drinkability
if
this
was
on
tap
at
my
local
bar
id
spend
the
whole
night
with
it
sure
it
may
be
a
tad
too
strong
but
i
think
this
makes
an
excellent
session
beer
medium
body
with
gentle
tingly
carbonation
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
a
beer
that
definitely
leaves
you
begging
for
more
a
well
done
lager
eh
no
thanks
overall
lakefront
gets
a
kudos
on
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
finish
is
relatively
clean
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
i
was
hoping
for
more

beer
im
not
really
impressed
i
got
a
variety
8
pack
from
lakefront
and
really
havent
been
impressed
with
many
of
these
a
very
sessionable
amber
the
riverwest
stein
beer
has
low
to
moderate
carbonation
and
is
medium
bodied
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
apple
from
the
yeast
flavors
of
maple
apple
and
a
slight
butterscotch
malty
grain
presence
too
but
well
integrated
color
is
a
deep
reddish
amber
tone
true
to
style
with
a
small
amount
of
foam
truly
a
session
style
lager
with
an
interesting
flavor
profile
to
match
very
reliable
a
quality
session
brew
if
there
ever
was
one
a
good
solid
offering
from
lakefront
one
of
my
gotos
should
i
see
its
tap
handle
gracing
a
bar
pours
an
orangecopper
color
topped
by
a
pinky
fingers
worth
of
offwhite
head
that
vanishes
almost
immediately
very
light
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
palate
is
mildly
sweet
up
front
with
a
touch
of
smokiness
and
just
a
little
bit
of
metallic
tinge
a
hint
of
vanilla
sweetness
emerges
midpalate
before
a
mildly
hoppy
finish
body
is
nice
and
silky
smooth
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
looks
pretty
with
an
amberred
body
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
mix
of
caramel
malt
and
american
citrus
caramel
the
malt
is
super
smooth
on
the
tongue
but
too
faint
the
hops
are
nice
a
bit
juicy
but
not
complex
theres
also
a
slight
off
aroma
and
flavor
that
comes
out
as
this
beer
warms
i
dont
know
about
this
one
something
is
rubbing
me
the
wrong
way
excellent
beer
drinkability
solid
brew
and
unique
for
a
lager
which
is
why
im
sure
its
getting
plenty
of
good
reviews
but
overall
not
that
amazing
kinda
cant
make
up
its
mind
whether
it
wants
to
be
a
lager
or
an
ale
and
basically
gets
stuck
somewhere
in
between
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
but
dont
expect
the
world
this
one
has
a
little
hop
to
it
is
very
clean
lightly
malty
and
very
very
drinkable
its
not
exciting
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
its
a
great
step
up
from
a
pale
macro
lagers
and
probably
the
best
example
of
this
style
ive
yet
had
that
may
be
damning
with
faint
praise
as
i
mentioned
i
havent
seen
many
of
these
in
stores
around
here
but
nevertheless
its
enjoyable
this
brew
poured
a
clean
clear
dark
brown
with
moderate
head
that
quickly
dissipated
but
carbonation
that
kept
on
going
nice
maltiness
earthy
and
robust
mild
brown
bread
slight
yeastiness
and
medium
body
clean
crisp
finish
with
an
earthy
bitterness
and
molasses
aftertaste
a
mustiness
permeates
the
brew
but
it
is
not
totally
overpowering
almost
pleasant
very
german
feeling
a
more
complex
amber
than
im
used
too
with
more
malt
layering
and
less
hop
flavor
a
hearty
lager
and
with
a
hardly
noticeable
alcohol
content
it
sessions
well
very
easy
to
drink
the
glass
was
empty
before
i
realized
it
drinkability
is
good
this
is
not
complex
but
rather
a
simple
and
clean
tasting
brew
that
is
refreshing
there
are
enough
flavors
here
to
produce
a
solid
profile
enjoyable
by
many

very
nice
there
are
so
many
different
ales
now
available
in
america
i
think
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
ones
dont
expect
anything
extreme
just
a
flavorful
fullbodied
ale
from
my
lakefront
variety
8pack
i
was
hoping
to
be
underwhelmed
by
this
variety
pack
because
theres
nothing
worse
than
finding
something
you
like
in
a
trial
pack
and
never
being
able
to
get
it
on
a
regular
basis
where
you
live
case
in
point
riverwest
stein

wow
gorgeous
deep

in
the
glass
with
a
nice

of
foam
that
coated
your
face
when
you
tried
to
drink

perfect

and
rich
soft
creamyemphasis
on
the
soft

a
nice
malthops
balance
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
is
equally
balanced
but
dynamic
at
the
same
time
a
touch
of
hops
hits
you
first
then
a
rich
satisfying
malt
then
a
solid
hops
spice
kicks
in
to
round
out
the
flavor
and
provide
a
really
nice
tartness
on
the
tongue
i
think
i
said
the
word
wow
out
loud
at
least
3
times
pausing
to
look
at
the
contents
while
draining
the
glass
fantastic
and
now
i
have
to
find
a
place
where
i
can
buy
more
than
the
trial
back
how
far
is
milwaukee
anyway
d
a
good
highly
sessionable
brew
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
amber
ales
but
this
one
might
have
turned
me
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
and
was
totally
taken
by
surprise
from
a
lager
it
had
the
spiciness
from
hop
and
yeast
that
ive
only
had
from
an
ale
one
of
the
better
botm
picks
ive
received
overally
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
nice
overall
flavor
and
sufficient
hops
to
give
me
a
small
fix
went
down
easy
drinkability
smooth
and
fruity
and
buttery
lots
of
things
going
on
and
a
good
choice
to
keep
in
the
fridge
beer
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
has
sustaimed
very
well
nose
initially
was
very
citrusy
and
has
settled
down
to
a
nice
malty
bready
smell
taste
is
very
malty
and
bready
but
finishes
with
a
slightly
citusy
hop
the
aftertaste
is
classic
lager
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
almost
a
full
body
drinkability
is
very
good
this
would
make
a
great
tailgait
brew
this
is
a
great
lager
one
of
the
tastiest
bottomfermenting
beers
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
a
little
crispness
in
the
finish
makes
it
easy
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
well
done
brew
from
lakefront
good
stuff
first
id
like
to
say
that
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
wth
that
said
what
a
great
beer
a
terrific
coppercolored
beer
with
a
nice
white
head
sweet
clean
taste
with
a
good
deal
of
hops
for
an
amber
lager
melons
and
citrus
in
there
too
this
is
a
fresh
crisp
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
it
poured
a
copper
color
that
head
a
nice
looking
head
at
first
but
then
fades
away
into
nothing
smell
was
of
milk
honey
and
a
toasted
grain
character
taste
was
pretty
sharp
and
a
bitter
in
the
beginning
giving
way
to
a
sweeter
presence
in
the
end
i
got
some
hops
in
the
flavor
some
tobacco
and
grainy
husk
mouthfeel
was
medium
drinkability
was
decent
enough
although
i
wish
i
had
some
nice
cheese
to
pair
with
this
one
i
have
a
feeling
it
would
go
well
with
some
chevre
not
a
bad
beer
as
far
as
i
can
tell
good
stuff
pours
a
strong
off
white
thre
finger
head
and
some
semi
sticky
lacing
the
bubbling
is
strong
for
the
style
greeted
with
an
oktoberfest
like
deep
amber
the
aroma
is
a
sweetmalt
with
notes
of
bread
and
butterscotch
a
sweet
buttered
bread
malt
hits
with
a
little
hops
in
the
finish
that
balances
the
sweetness
alittle
but
not
enough
mlaty
sweet
chewy
yet
tight
palate
definetly
stayed
in
the
center
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
very
crisp
and
tangy
at
the
same
time
its
just
a
little
creamy
as
well
put
that
along
with
the
excellent
balance
and
i
could
see
this
thing
being
an
excellent
everyday
drinker
no
matter
what
the
conditions
i
just
hope
everything
from
my
sampler
pack
can
match
this
brew
the
bottle
is
very
colorful
and
inviting
that
being
said
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
murky
amberorange
color
with
a
thin
creme
colored
head
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
amberred
malt
and
a
touch
of
citrus
the
taste
actually
has
a
bit
more
hops
to
it
than
i
was
expecting
from
an
amber
lager
it
starts
out
slightly
sweet
of
amber
malt
and
quickly
transitions
to
a
pleasant
bitterness
that
leaves
a
mouth
dry
and
hoppy
alcohol
is
only
slightly
detectable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
definitely
an
enjoyable
one
appearance
is
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
decent
head
formation
aroma
is
a
nice
caramel
malt
and
fruity
hop
balance
flavor
is
also
similarly
balanced
with

this

i
do
not

i
could
drink
a

it
in

i

it

a

less

would
make

beer
so
after
about
3

you
might
start
to
feel
a

this
is
a
beer
youll
definitely
want
to
save
room
for
drinkability
great
overall
beer
leaves
you
wanting
more
the
high
level
of
carbonation
may
fill
you
up
quickly
though
too
bad
that
i
dont
own
a
stein
because
riverwest
stein
beer
really
should
be
drunk
out
of
that
particular
vessel
its
a
fine
example
of
an
often
overlooked
style
and
is
easily
the
best
lakefront
brewery
beer
that
ive
had
yet
recommended
this
little
confection
reminds
me
of
an
oktoberfest
in
that
its
not
overly
dark
has
hints
of
roasted
and
toasted
goodness
and
a
smidge
of
sweetness
to
it
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
or
extraordinary
just
some
ground
up
nuts
and
tree
sap
and
fermentables
but
seeing
as
i
have
nothing
wise
or
witty
to
say
about
it
it
should
be
noted
that
i
would
recommend
you
tasting
it
but
not
buying
stock
in
the
company
overall
impression
nice
amber
lager
very
well
balanced
highly
drinkable
bottle
notes
that
it
is
an
all
malt
lager
moderately
bitter
with
no
grainyness
to
the
malt
barest
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
finish
was
a
little
weak
but
not
enough
to
be
a
detraction
seemed
like
it
could
use
a
bit
of
beefing
up
to
meet
the
amber
lager
category
lakefront

stein
beer

a
hazy
orange
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
smell
is
mostly
malty
taste
is
quite
good
strong
malty
backbone
with
a
good
hoppy
finish
definitely
better
than
i
expected
recommended
the
moderate
mouth
has
plenty
of
carbonation
and
dryness
from
the
hops
i
wish
i
had
bought
this
as
a
sixer
instead
of
a
single
very
drinkable
the
best
al
ive
ever
had
not
bad
from
the
bottle
the
beer
presents
a
reddish
amber
color
suprise
suprise
with
a
short
lived
head

medium
level
of
carbonation
no

aromas
are
mostly

some
fermented
grain
taste
is
medium
to
full
bodied
lots
of
malty
goodness
some
hints
of
grain
and
earth
wood
notes
nice
mouthfeel
is
nominal
and
rather
uneventful
drinkability
is
north
of
average
a
good
lager
when
something
of
the
red
variety
strikes
your
fancy
worth
trying
light
mahoganycopper
with
minimal
haze
thin
head
has
little
retention
appears
somewhat
flat
aroma
is
weak
as
only
a
light
caramel
breadiness
hits
the
nose
very
macroish
the
taste
is
much
improved
caramel
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
initially
present
balanced
by
a
clean
tangy
bitterness
toward
the
finish
there
is
enough
flavor
here
to
keep
me
interested
at
least
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
this
was
an
easy
to
drink
brew
perhaps
sessionable
for
some
worth
a
try
clear
coppery
body
with
a
good
sized
creamy
head
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
with
notes
of
toffee
and
bread
quite
malty
taste
follows
suit
lots
of
malts
without
much
to
cut
them
caramel
runs
strong
and
thick
a
slight
fruityness
in
the
finish
but
it
doesnt
really
cut
off
the
malty
caramellike
syrup
texture
this
tastes
more
like
a
vienna
lager
than
anything
else
but
its
not
really
that
solid
of
an
offering
i
am
surprised
the
abv
was
at
6
seemed
like
it
would
be
lower
and
maybe
it
should
be
i
will
try
this
again
and
see
if
i
get
a
different
result
but
its
really
just
average
at
best
imo
this
brew
pours
a
clear
deep
ruby
color
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
and
recedes
ever
so
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
really
amazing
zesty
grapefruity
sweet
clean
wow
the
taste
lives
up
to
the
aroma
zesty
grapefruit
without
the
backgroud
haze
that
you
would
get
in
an
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
flavorful
lager
and
i
will
certainly
buy
this
again
drinkable
beer
that
would
work
well
a
session
quaffer
or
an
apperitif
to
something
stronger
this
came
with
a
big
white
head
that
quickly
subsided
leaving
behind
a
good
bit
of
sticky
lace
it
was
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
slightly
malty
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
sharp
cheesy
taste
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
more
hoppy
than
sweet
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
ive
had
better
and
from
this
brewery
uf
clear
copper
body
head
is
impressive
about
34
with
a
slow
fade
lots
of
sweet
carmel
malts
in
the
nose
some
breadiness
taste
is
also
very
smooth
and
malty
a
very
good
hops
kick
is
also
present
sweet
breadiness
pervades
what
mroe
do
you
want
from
an
amber
lager
sweet
but
not
cloying
hops
are
way
above
average
from
the
usual
amber
lager
i
see
no
faults
here
one
of
lakefronts
best
beers
dalthough
i
only
bought
a
single
as
a
precautionary
measure
i
would
happily
keep
this
beer
in
the
fridge
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
finger
of
white
bubbly
head
that
coats
the
glass
but
leaves
no
lacing
smell
is
floral
and
fruity
for
an
amber
lager
more
flavorful
than
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
this
style
too
sweet
caramel
malts
citrusfloral
hops
a
bit
of
mustymetallic
offflavor
in
the
finish
but
i
find
this
in
most
lagers
mouthfeel
is
full
and
coating
crisp
but
smooth
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
amber
lager
here
lagers
dont
tend
to
blow
my
mind
but
for
an
ale
guy
this
is
a
tasty
beer
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
a
brown
color
with
a
small
head
sweet
malty
aroma
with
just
a
little
bit
of
an
off
sour
smell
rich
malty
flavor
the
flavor
is
a
little
bubblegumlike
a
nice
fruity
hoppiness
prevents
this
beer
from
becoming
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
full
for
the
style
great
drinkability
i
didnt
think
i
would
like
this
beer
after
smelling
it
but
it
tasted
really
good
paired
this
with
a
grilled
turkey
tip
salad
with
a
mild
feta
cheese
its
an
absolutely
gorgeous
well
amberred
color
its
so
alluring
that
my
girlfriend
is
beginning
to
get
jealous
smells
of
lemons
and
prunes
in
a
good
way
though
i
promise
tastes
fruity
tangy
and
malty
it
reminds
me
of
both
lakefronts
klisch
and
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
very
flavorful
fucking
good
beer
lush
notes
of
toasty
even
slightly
roasty
nutty
mildly
sweet
and
caramelish
malt
entice
you
in
the
flavor
accented
by
grassy
and
delicately
citrusy
hops
it
starts
more
nutty
and
toasty
then
becomes
caramelish
across
the
middle
and
finally
finishes
dry
with
a
zing
of
lightly
sweet
malt
and
hops
the
bitterness
and
some
toasty
malt
linger
in
the
aftertaste
reminding
you
that
youve
just
tasted
some
beer
and
need
to
taste
some
more
very
nicely
done
a
sentimental
favorite
based
in
my
moms
old
neighborhood
originally
out
of
a
storefront
bakery
good
people
poured
into
a
pint
glass
bottle
had
a
first
week
of
march
date
on
the
label
has
a
nice
ruby
tan
color
with
a
decent
head
and
lacing
lots
of
carmel
maltiness
with
some
flowery
hops
in
the
background
in
the
nose
lots
of
carmel
comes
through
in
the
taste
with
not
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
the
mouthfeel
is
way
to
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
no
real
faults
but
i
could
not
sit
down
and
have
one
after
another
this
really
reminds
me
more
of
a
vienna
lager
or
bock
than
anything
which
semantically
speaking
are
amber
lagers
so
i
guess
lakefront
isnt
wrong
but
they
arent
completely
descriptive
either
this
beer
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
as
such
despite
being
tasty
and
smooth
i
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
more
than
2
of
these
as
they
are
very
rich
to
my
palette
still
quite
tasty
stuff
clear
rubybrown
with
copperytawny
influences
the
color
is
lovely
the
head
was
beige
in
color
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
less
than
a
of
an
inch
in
height
head
retention
was
poor
it
faded
quickly
to
a
thin
collar
the
subsequent
lacing
was
clumpy
spotty
and
it
wasnt
very
widespread
overall
it
is
an
attractive
beer
the
nose
is
clean
sharp
toasty
with
caramel
notes
and
traces
of
earthiness
light
nutty
aromas
the
potency
was
low
it
is
simple
smelling
it
fails
to
say
much
i
detected
no
offflavors
but
there
isnt
anything
to
get
excited
over
apathetic
the
palate
is
nice
it
is
improved
over
the
nose
mainly
because
the
flavors
are
louder
thankfully
the
hops
are
clear
softly
bitter
with
a
nice
earthy
taste
malt
sweetness
is
well
placed
it
is
rich
within
its
boarders
caramel
mainly
with
hints
of
toasty
grain
i
like
the
palate
it
is
very
clean
very
simple
and
straightforward
i
have
no
complaints
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
reminds
me
of
sa
boston
lager
a
firm
medium
in
body
with
solid
carbonation
of
all
the
lakefront
beers
ive
had
this
one
has
the
best
mouthfeel
all
of
the
others
ive
sampled
were
lacking
in
carbonation
and
body
in
this
case
the
mouthfeel
is
fitting
for
this
beer
drinkable
i
bet
it
would
be
good
with
pizza
or
a
grilled
ham
sandwich
id
love
this
beer
if
the
aftertaste
were
sharper
it
falls
apart
a
bit
and
becomes
muddled
id
buy
a
sixpack
of
this
in
the
future
while
it
is
nothing
special
it
was
good
enough
to
stay
on
my
radar
it
was
purchased
as
part
of
a
samplerpack
in
milwaukee
wi
poured
into
an
imperial

malty

a
sedate
yet
intensifying

drinkability
is
excellent
this
beer
was
made
for
sessioning
this
beer
is
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
small
white
head
the
head
does
not
stick
around
very
long
there
is
a
strong
smell
of
malt
and
hops
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
the
taste
is
good
malty
with
a
slight

the
mouthfeel
is

it
is
very
drinkable

a
lovely

tight
laced
cream

seems
to
want
to
curl
up
on
the
sides

is
there
but
not
overruly
smells
very
sweet
apricots
maybe
and
a
light
hint
of
alcohol
lots
of
subtle
undertones
hard
to
describe
the
taste
leans
into
the
same
apricot
taste
but
not
as
sweet
as
it
smells
here
comes
the
hint
on
hops
and
the
aftertaste
fails
to
go
bitter
an
interesting
beer
good
but
very
hard
to
describe
well
suffice
to
say
that
its
drinkable
dark
copperred
with
a
glasscoating
offwhite
head
smells
of
rich
cookie
dough
malt
and
a
touch
of
spicy
german
hops
taste
starts
off
with
the
sweet
cookie
dough
malts
followed
by
some
roasty
burnt
caramel
nice
hops
are
minimal
but
balance
the
sweetness
finish
is
a
tad
bitter
with
lingering
cookie
malt

surpisingly
chewy
one
of

with
a
little

background
good

not

dry
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all

a

in
color
very
small
white

soft
maltbready
nose
the
taste
has
a
nice
malt
profile
similar
to
a
red
ale
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
but
the
hop
balance
keeps
it
from
being
overwhelming
it
is
not
hoppy
at
all
but
the
hops
do
their
work
in
balancing
this
excellent
malty
beer
finishes
dry
and
tight
solid
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
brew
clear
deep
scarlet
color
with
a
1
inch
creamy
tan
head
theres
a
nice
refined
malt
aroma
with
a
hop
dryness
apparant
wonderful
vienna
like
malt
presence
on
the
palate
this
is
a
hearty
malty
brew
i
would
choose
this
beer
over
most
of
the
multitude
of
oktoberfest
brews
that
come
out
in
september
a
subdued
spicy
character
and
a
great
drying
on
the
finish
as
the
balanced
hop
load
clean
of
the
palate
rather
impressive
considering
the
style
this
beer
produces
a
beautiful
head
that
gradually
becomes
white
lacing
which
lasts
its
an
amber
color
and
tastes
just
right
to
me
that
is
the
balance
between
malt
and
hops
is
perfectly
achieved
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
the
aroma
is
a
rich
beer
smell
im
really
happy
that
my
publix
carries
it
very
good
smooth
beer
with
easy
taste
malty
with
some
fruity
notes
easy
drinking
pours
an
amber
color
with
decent
head
smells
of
toasted
malts
and
earthiness
fruity
sweet
taste
like
blueberries
as
well
as
spices
a
hop
finish
that
is
dry
and
slightly
astringent
smooth
drinking
creamy
feel
not
bad
sub
average
lager
toasted
yet
toasted
grain
notes
are
almost
unnoticeable
o
nothing
over
the
top
and
nothing
spectacular
a
nice
little
beer
with
a
bit
of
character
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
tried
this
beer
from
a
mixed
6
and
i
must
say
that
it
was
okay
the
main
thing
i
notice
about
this
beer
is
a
slight
after
taste
i
would
probably
try
it
again
as
a
draft
beer
to
see
if
there
is
a
major
difference
pretty
good
beer
enjoyable
with
appetizers
and
steak
nothing
to
see
here
folks
heck
id
rather
have
a
yuengling
o
no
hop
character
in
the
flavor
light
crisp
clean
refersing
great
ibu
and
taste
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
lager
smooth
flow
and
great
taste
but
watch
out
for
getting
it
on
draft
dirty
pipes
ruins
the
tastes
completely
as
it
is
thin
dark
amber
and
a
small
head
after
poured
from
tap
very
sweet
nose
of
caramel
and
biscuit
cloying
for
lager
not
a
light
nor
refreshing
beast
a
marzenesque
malt
bomb
very
sweet
cherries
chocolate
and
caramel
taste
overall

i
wish
they
sold
this
here
302beerguy
traded
me
this
one
and
so
far
its
probably
the
most
impressive
lager
ive
tried
outside
of
the
midwest
area
i
really
enjoy
it
its
a
fireside
late
night
cozy
lager
for
sure
medium
light
body
and
medium
to
medium
high
carbonation
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
091912
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
to
me
this
is
like
a
restrained
sam
adams
pleasant
i
think
the
toasting
pushes
this
to
being
bit
full
for
summer
so
good
it
should
be
good
for
fall
drinkin
all
in
all
a
good
brew
overall
this
is
just
a
solid
flagship
lager
it
really
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
very
well
with
a
thirst
quenching
quality
in
an
easy
to
quaff
feel
and
weight
tasted
like
a
normal
budweiser
to
me
medium
head
not
a
special
beer
cheers
not
too
much
to
say
about
this
one
it
is
smooth
and
has
nice
notes
of
barley
and
slight
hints
of
spice
dont
get
me
wrong
its
not
at
all
a
bad
beer
it
has
nice
balance
and
tastes
good
i
just
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
yuengling
overall
an
above
average
beer
that
is
a
nice
option
in
the
lager
world
especially
since
its
made
locally
to
me
and
always
fresh
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
can
only
say
that
if
this
is
the
same
beer
that
was
given
a
number
of
medals
there
may
have
been
a
lack
of
competition
there
are
too
many
good
flavorful
ambers
now
for
one
so
light
in
aroma
and
flavor
to
compete
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
creamy
white
head
there
was
quick
dissipation
and
minimal
lacing
left
though
it
has
a
lighter
aroma
but
with
nice
toasted
notes
and
some
hints
of
fruit
the
flavors
match
the
aroma
and
it
was
a
good
beer
with
brunch
there
was
also
a
nice
weight
to
the
body
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
overall
excellent
a
lager
for
folks
who
usually
get
bored
by
lagers
also
a
lager
for
people
who
love
lagers
theres
everything
to
like
about
this
and
no
discernible
flaws
lets
see
what
happens
after
the
anheuserbusch
acquisition
overall
pretty
solid
lager
i
havent
had
it
in
a
while
and
think
it
has
gotten
better
than
when
i
had
it
a
few
years
ago
although
the
price
and
the
appearance
of
the
pour
were
a
bit
underwhelming
for
the
beer
it
more
than
delivered
on
both
taste
and
smell
the
name
is
spot
on
because
on
the
nose
and
after
the
first
taste
you
are
bombarded
by
the
taste
of
toasted
wheat
and
malt
that
i
found
stupendous
wonderful
toasted
wheat
in
the
beginning
and
then
a
caramel
flavor
to
finish
it
for
what
it
is
i
think
that
the
price
is
a
steal
at
about
three
dollars
a
bomber
here
in
ct
overall
meh
im
not
the
biggest
lager
guy
so
would
i
have
it
again
possibly
i
might
have
reviewed
this
a
bit
more
favorably
had
i
tried
it
earlier
in
a
session
toasted
lager
this
is
on
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
buds
theres
a
really
nice
toast
and
caramel
flavor
that
leaves
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
fairly
high
which
makes
this
really
drinkable
with
its
low
bitterness
i
tend
to
find
lagers
a
bit
boring
for
the
most
part
but
something
as
simple
as
making
the
beer
taste
a
bit
toastlike
worked
very
well
id
have
another
one
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
after
youve
had
a
few
but
are
still
looking
for
something
with
a
little
bit
of
flavor
most
major
beers
i
can
think
of
overall
a
solid
lager
this
beer
does
not
have
much
going
for
it
very
interesting
that
it
behaves
a
bit
like
ale
rather
than
a
lager
but
it
would
be
nicer
if
it
had
more
body
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
im
not
typically
a
big
fan
of
this
style
of
lager
but
this
one
has
alot
of
character
tastes
of
floral
hops
bready
malts
and
toasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
with
high
carbonation
just
slightly
chewy
with
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
great
beer
overall
vienna
lagers
make
for
great
flagship
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
flavorful
and
balanced
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
noncraft
drinkers
to
enter
the
craft
beer
world
o
i
found
this
to
be
quite
enjoyable
the
darker
malts
than
typical
for
most
canned
american
lagers
made
for
a
deeper
flavor
profile
without
being
overly
sweet
a
nice
complimentary
hoppiness
while
still
staying
maltforward
a
quality
canned
lager
maybe
its
not
quite
enough
to
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
another
sixpack
when
im
in
the
mood
cheers
im
a
little
new
at
this
so
forgive
my
lack
of
craft
beer
buzzwords
but
for
some
reason
this
beer
just
went
really
well
with
food
it
was
flavorful
enough
but
not
overpowering
ive
had
beers
before
that
were
basically
meals
inandofthemselves
or
maybe
this
is
how
its
always
been

not
where
i
got
this
one
but
its
cold
and
looks
tempting
so
lets
give
it
a
go
pours
a
reddish
hued
golden
color
with
a
very
tightly
packed
white
foamy
head
i
think
the
malt
backbone
truly
takes
center
stage
in
the
nose
with
very
little
else
being
evident
its
sweet
a
small
roasty
malt
and
generally
one
i
would
choose
over
other
lagers
on
tap

it
almost
has
a
smoked
kind
of

i
am
happy
that
this
beer
exists
though
there
are
many
other
blue
point
beers
i
would
reach
for
first
i
consider
this
beer
a
solid
dinner
time
brew
but
on
its
own
it
is
somewhat
lacking
overall
there
was
nothing
outstanding
about
this
beer
but
for
some
reason
i
found
myself
drinking
it
down
quicker
than
normal
very
easy
drinking
and
worth
a
shot
since
i
went
all
the
way
to
patchogue
ny
to
visit
the
brewery
and
buy
this
im
going
to
pretend
it
was
brewed
on
premises
so
there
overall
a
nice
sessionable
offering
from
blue
point
it
makes
a
nice
substitute
for
flavorless
lagers
and
id
have
it
again
the
body
is
crisp
and
fresh
good
carbonation
level
nice
sharp
lager
flavors
of
grains
light
toffee
and
a
short
bitter
bite
at
the
finish
dang
this
was
really
refreshing
and
tasty
i
could
make
this
a
regular
with
my
cookouts
this
summer
recommend
copper
orange
in
color
depth
of
head
varied
greatly
depending
on
the
pour
whitish
lingered
not
much
of
an
aroma
hints
of
fruit
apple
pineapple
taste
is
bready
toasted
as
the
name
suggests
hints
of
rye
caraway
feel
is
combo
of
crisp
and
creamy
bit
heavier
than
many
lagers
easy
to
drink
decent
lager
but
definitely
better
ones
out
there
in
the
genre
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
was
rather
excited
to
see
this
on
tap
at
dinner
in
a
random
restaurant
starts
with
a
dark
golden
color
medium
cream
head
and
chocolate
malts
in
the
nose
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
and
surprising
balance
the
texture
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
still
strong
enough
lots
of
bready
malts
accompanying
a
surpisingly
sturdy
hop
presence
and
a
nutty
finish
overall
this
has
always
been
a
good
comfort
beer
in
the
bars
of
long
island
overall
a
well
done
lager
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
great
amber
color
was
a
bit
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
big
foamy
head
that
disapates
to
thin
film
with
ok
lacing
nice
sweet
tasting
a
little
hint
of
citrus
worked
well
on
a
hot
day
very
refreshing
not
sure
what
toasted
means
here
d
good
drinkability
but
kind
of
filling
and
not
an
exciting
enough
flavor
to
go
right
back
to
if
youve
bought
a
variety
pack
which
i
recommend
doing
with
this
beer
d
a
solid
brew
for
its
style
good
session
beer
d
very
easy
drinking
for
this
one
good
for
a
session
brew
you
get
a
finger
plus
head
of
offwhite
foam
creamy
foam
with
slight
dimpling
slightly
above
average
lacing
and
decent
retention
red
clay
to
copper
orange
in
color
just
short
of
full
transparency
mild
infusion
of

around

soft

more
texturally
present
than
deeply
scented
malted
milk
balls
dried
molasses
buttermilk
not
a
lot
of
hop
presence
perhaps
some
orange
peel
and
apricot
pit
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
is
foamy
yet
stops
short
of
getting
too
large
and
diffusing
the
flavors
metallic
edge
to
the
mouth
entry
iron
and
rust
delays
the
registering
of
the
flowers
and
more
tart
orange
to
lemon
peel
here
the
caramel
and
butterscotch
malty
flavors
less
overt
although
you
kinda
wish
they
were
hint
of
raw
nuts
the
prickle
from
the
carbonation
does
extend
its
presence
in
the
absence
of
more
resonant
flavors
no
big
flaws
simply
a
bit
boring
and
hohum
dont
find
it
growing
on
me
with
repeated
sips
i
poured
this
exceptional
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
almond
colored
almost
and
had
a
nice
tan
colored
head
the
beer
had
the
best
lacing
i
have
seen
in
a
beer
in
a
long
time
it
actually
left
rings
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
taste
was
fantastic
with
toasted
malty
caramelly
notes
i
will
buy
this
again
for
sure
shouldnt
be
priced
like
most
micros
not
worth
the
dough
but
if
you
see
it
out
in
a
bar
throw
two
back
youre
gonna
need
the
1st
one
to
warm
up
your
taste
to
it
so
you
can
enjoy
the
2nd
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
big
white
head
aromas
are
faint
but
favor
the
malty
end
of
the
spectrum
malts
and
hops
are
nicely
balanced
on
the
palate
tastes
are
initially
hopforward
and
earthy
giving
way
to
a
rustic
and
indeed
toasty
malt
sweetness
medium
body
crackles
with
lively
carbonation
very
enjoyable
all
on
its
own
drinkability
i
can
see
this
being
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
many
other
beers
i
would
reach
for
first
i
will
not
be
trying
this
again
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
dont
know
if
its
the
suggestion
of
the
name
or
the
actual
ingredientsprocess
but
this
has
a
very
toasty
taste
that
is
very
good
im
not
a
big
amber
lager
drinker
id
prefer
pislners
in
lagers
and
toasty
and
other
extreme
flavors
in
my
ales
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend

nothing

not

to

a

newbie
to
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
like
it
a
smidge
more
than
samuel
adams
bl
or
brooklyn
lager
though
i
think
great
lakes
eliot

tops
it

great
gateway
beer
for

beer
drinkers
or
those
transitioning
into
craftstock
a
cooler
have
some
folks
over
and
see
what
they
think
oelergud
d
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
poured
a
nice
golden
carbonated
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
laced
spottily
the
smell
didnt
yield
as
much
roasted
malt
and
biscuit
as
i
would
have
expected
in
fact
the
hop
bitterness
was
slightly
more
prominent
however
the
flavor
did
yield
a
more
prominent
roasted
maltiness
balanced
by
a
bitter
crisp
finish
with
no
lingering
aftertaste
good
carbo
mouthfeel
and
certainly
a
sessionable
beer
as
i
said
before
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favs
and
i
cant
recommend
it
enough
nothing
unique
about
this
lager
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
what
a
lager
should
taste
like
this
poured
a
clear
dark
gold
with
lots
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
bready
yeast
and
lemon
hops
with
roasted
barley
and
wheat
it
tasted
like
roasted
barley
and
earthy
caramel
with
creamy
yeast
and
a
bit
of
copper
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
smooth
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
nice
clean
taste
and
an
ultra
smooth
body
there
was
nothing
too
unique
or
rich
about
the
character
but
it
was
super
easy
to
drink
nice
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
with
that
flavor
and
mouthfeel
this
rates
huge
in
my
book
of
drinkability
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
now
sits
at
the
top
a
very
good
lager
more
akin
to
a
vienna
lager
in
my
opinion
nothing
great
but
solid
overall
overall
strengthens
its
consistency
as
the
glass
drains
caramel
comes
to
the
fore
an
interesting
flavor
to
a
lager
holds
its
own
against
the
cigar
i
am
smoking
one
suggestion
flaunting
medals
on
the
label
is
a
bit
of
shameless
selfpromotion
no
let
the
beer
do
the
talking
as
this
lager
is
capable
of
have
to
say
that
although
i
am
more
a
fan
of
ales
this
toasted
lager
was
very
enjoyable
it
is
a
beer
i
could
see
myself
coming
home
and
drinking
while
relaxing
or
drinking
with
friends
at
the
bar
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
not
a
bad
amber
ale
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
for
me
still
id
recommend
it
for
a
good
summer
lager
d
i
think
of
this
in
the
sessionable
category
and
i
think
of
it
fondly
easy
to
drink
light
and
good
flavor
but
not
complex
or
super
unique
dpretty
decent
it
won
an
award
a
couple
years
back
as
displayed
on
the
sixpack
holder
which
i
feel
it
deserved
i
noticed
this
beer
was
available
at
most
of
the
bars
we
visited
while
i
was
in
nyc
so
it
seemed
to
be
relatively
popular
i
definitely
liked
it
poured
a
cloudy
light
brown
with
a
good
tan
head
and
had
a
mellow
hoppy
aroma
with
some
biscuit
malt
in
the
smell
smooth
woodysmokey
i
guess
mild
hop
and
malt
flavors
in
the
beer
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
pleasant
to
drink
more
hop
bitternessdryness
than
sweet
yet
this
went
down
easy
at
lunch
and
i
could
easily
order
another
despite
its
simplicity
d
would
be
a
very
good
session
beer
but
is
not
too
unique
in
the
whole
scope
of
brews
solid
craftsmanship
and
flavor
drinkability
is
good
this
pairs
with
quite
a
bit
and
is
pretty
balanced
nothing
outstanding
but
its
the
fact
that
this
is
easily
available
and
better
than
average
makes
this
something
id
drink
again
tm
light
to
medium
body
with
a
kind
of
smooth
feeling
in
the
mouth
the
taste
tends
to
be
bitter
and
tart
with
a
few
malts
in
the
background
that
ends
dry
it
actually
went
down
fairly
fast
pours
a
perfectly
clear
orange
amber
with
a
good
sized
crème
head
that
falls
rather
quickly
nose
is
like
toasted
surprise
grains
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
kind
of
a
sweet
character
that
stays
consistent
throughout
as
well
feel
is
thicker
on
liquid
and
carbonation
is
fairly
full
this
is
a
good
alternative
to
macro
lager
crap
if
you
are
visiting
the
ny
area
and
see
it
anywhere
there
is
a
lack
of
selection
definitely
go
for
it
fresh
bottle
neutral
aroma
a
bit
of
coloured
body
without
noticeable
head
if
you
like
toasted
lager
this
is
for
you
a
little
complexity
in
malt
and
balanced
so
decent
for
style
average
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
ok
a
little
like
an
amber
and
a
festbeer
certainly
is
refreshing
for
a
warm
day
and
a
good
segue
beer
for
nonbas
other
than
that
not
much
to
report
clear
copper
with
a
good
head
nose
has
some
fruit
metal
light
floral
hops
dryish
with
some
roasted
maltiness
and
a
bit
of
a
fruity
undertone
husky
grain
as
well
quite
dry
overall
and
light
in
body
quite
drinkable
with
a
nice
grainy
aftertaste
nice
head
sticks
around
for
a
bit
amber
red
beer
pretty
nicely
carbonated
hoppy
aroma
and
a
slight
bit
of
toasted
grains
not
as
much
as
i
would
have
expected
from
a
toasted
lager
it
smells
pretty
nice
and
upon
first
sip
i
get
the
toasty
bread
up
front
but
never
again
just
in
that
first
taste
malty
for
a
lager
and
the
hops
dont
carry
through
the
beer
just
in
aroma
feels
pretty
fine
not
too
heavy
not
too
sweet
a
bit
too
dry
at
the
finish
line
drinkable
but
i
think
its
a
good
first
beer
of
the
night
i
would
move
onto
something
with
a
bit
more
depth
a
good
beer
by
no
means
great
glad
i
only
picked
up
two
try
it
thanks
gary
drink
ability
very
good
light
and
refreshing
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
easily
and
is
refreshing
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
typical
lager
nothing
outstanding
nothing
bad
either
just
there
a
good
lawnmower
beer
but
nothing
i
would
pay
a
premium
for
the
pour
was
nice
enough
with
a
light
coppery
amber
and
a
nice
clarity
to
it
really
intresting
mix
here
of
light
carbonation
and
as
mooth
white
frothy
head
very
light
aroma
here
soft
malts
light
grains
and
a
touch
of
off
fruit
notes
mixed
in
with
a
earthy
touch
to
it
the
flavor
was
light
crisp
medium
bodied
with
a
light
hop
notes
and
a
smooth
grain
profile
to
it
really
nice
bite
in
the
finish
as
the
hops
take
front
and
center
stage
light
dry
finish
and
a
nice
smooth
touch
to
finish
it
off
overall
not
bad
at
all
not
the
best
but
still
a
very
sessionable
little
lager
a
solid
tasty
lager
overall
no
off
flavors
just
a
straight
forward
drinkable
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
not
very
robust
but
whats
there
is
good
i
could
blast
through
a
six
of
this
no
problem
d
bought
it
for
the
name
just
to
try
glad
i
did
this
is
a
good
brew
that
i
strongly
recommend
to
any
beer
drinker
good
pickup
on
my
part
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
a
session
beer
although
i
think
the
slight
honey
aftertaste
would
get
old
after
you
throw
back
a
few
but
overall
its
a
pleasantly
crisp
beer
with
still
some
flavor
d
very
enjoyable
beer
since
it
is
so
smooth
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
pint
or
two
d
nice
easy
drinking
brew
d
this
is
a
beer
that
has
the
potential
to
grow
on
you
like
a
lighter
brooklyn
lager
or
sam
adam
boston
lager
refreshing
the
summery
beer
its
meant
to
be
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
from
start
to
finish
who
says
lagers
are
boring

not

could
make
a
decent
sessioner
but
not
anything
i
will
buy
on
a
regular
basis
pours
a
dark
golden
slightly
amber
color
with
2
full
fingers
of
pillowy
white
head
that
is
relatively
slow
to
recede
classic
lager
aroma
more
of
the
craft
than
the
macro
variety
if
you
know
what
i
mean
with
surprise
toasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
pretty
good
toasty
and
slightly
nutty
maybe
even
with
a
touch
of
caramel
malts
are
the
focus
here
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
and
even
lighter
hop
flavor
its
relatively
indistinct
and
i
cant
name
a
variety
or
specific
characteristics
but
its
a
more
general
slightly
herbal
hoppiness
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
with
a
light
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
caramel
good
mouthfeel
mediumlight
body
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
darn
good
this
was
an
enjoyable
brew
that
while
easy
to
drink
and
low
in
alcohol
provided
interesting
flavors
that
make
it
a
good
session
beer
d
probably
fine
if
its
whats
available
for
session
or
party
or
maybe
ontap
quite
a
unique
beer
it
is
probably
the
most
refreshing
and
crisp
beer
ive
ever
had
alas
it
also
has
almost
no
taste
and
its
very
bland
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
its
just
way
too
easy
to
drink
which
is
a
very
good
thing
i
cant
help
but
think
if
they
added
a
little
flavor
to
it
this
would
be
a
damn
good
beer
it
is
what
it
is
for
the
style
it
falls
pretty
much
in
line
with
the
basics
but
is
very
average
in
my
opinion
i
think
this
would
make
for
a
pretty
good
session
beer
overall
d
the
smooth
beer
has
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
for
a
session
lager
nuff
said
its
ok
but
ill
pass
have
a
boston
lager
instead
my
buddy
raved
about
this
brew
after
he
had
it
at
the
tasting
room
on
long
island
naturally
he
brought
some
back
with
him
before
he
left
for
school
and
said
that
i
had
to
try
it
ive
heard
quite
a
bit
about
it
and
ill
say
that
im
pretty
impressed
with
it
i
wouldnt
rate
it
as
incredibly
mindblowingly
excellent
but
its
definately
way
above
average
in
terms
of
flavor
drinkability
etc
its
just
put
together
really
really
well
try
it
for
yourself
the
drinkablilty
is
above
average
the
toasty
malts
tend
to
crowd
my
taste
buds
but
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
pours
a
clear
amber
dark
copper
with
small
slow
bubbles
good
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
nicefoamy
film
the
aroma
is
a
spicey
hop
citrus
with
some
toasted
traditional
white
bread
the
taste
starts
with
a
dry
bread
malt
powder
very
toasted
malt
flavor
then
combines
and
finishes
with
spicey
oranges
an
a
litle
rye
flavors
as
well
the
palate
is
balanced
well
bewteen
malt
and
hops
good
sessionable
beer
glad
this
is
available
in
illinois
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
best
by
october
2008
indicated
on
the
bottle
poured
a
translucent
amber
with
a
1
5
inch
tight
offwhite
head
excellent
retention
with
some
bands
of
lacing
adhering
to
one
side
of
the
glass
during
the
tasting
copious
tiny
bubbles
effervesced
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
to
the
underside
of
the
cap
scents
of
malt
and
wheat
a
little
bready
taste
consistent
with
nose
as
well
as
a
mild
caramel
character
and
a
light
hoppiness
that
presents
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
pleasantly
effervescent
and
also
a
little
creamy
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
brew
wish
i
tried
this
one
sooner
d
low
abv
was
smooth
and
easy
i
suppose
it
could
have
better
balance
and
be
less
saltybut
this
could
also
be
a
beer
to
offer
the
many
friends
and
family
who
love
budweiser
and
are
afraid
to
try
something
new
i
say
this
not
because
it
is
the
best
offering
for
a
bud
fanbut
because
it
is
a
simple
lager
d
notes
good
sessionability
here
i
enjoyed
this
beer
this
tastes
great
nice
malt
flavor
that
you
can
tell
has
been
lightly
roastedtoasted
hops
are
medium
bitterness
and
finishes
clean
i
hate
to
say
balanced
but
this
lager
is
very
balanced
does
not
taste
like
a
traditional
lager
and
maybe
lacks
some
of
the
hop
crisp
or
sharper
hop
characteristics
the
toasted
malt
makes
this
very
pleasing
sessionble
me
likey
it
can
be
easily
drank
but
ends
a
bit
sour
i
only
had
12
of
a
bottle
this
is
a
fairly
average
american
lager
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
but
still
good
to
drink
d
these
seem
easy
to
put
down
on
the
downside
the
flavoring
isnt
all
that
great
i
could
prolly
do
two
of
these
and
thats
it
a
sour
salty
aftertaste
doesnt
appeal
to
me
d
also
good
here
an
upper
class
lager
drink
away
4111
ontap
still
wish
this
beer
was
more
impressive
drinkable
but
not
a
lot
better
than
say
negro
modelo
nothing
really
special
here
just
a
pretty
well
crafted
lager
craft
beers
like
this
irk
me
a
tad
because
you
want
for
so
much
more
while
drinking
it
ignore
the
toasted
claim
this
is
one
you
could
take
or
leave
if
something
remotely
better
appeared
easy
to
drink
for
sure
a
refreshing
lager
this
beer
had
a
clear
saffron
coloring
to
it
and
poured
with
a
light
head
as
well
i
had
high
expectations
since
the
label
had
indicated
that
it
was
a
2006
world
cup
gold
medal
winner
but
was
surprisingly
disappointed
to
find
only
an
above
average
lager
i
was
definitely
expecting
more
of
a
toasty
malt
flavor
but
instead
found
a
refreshingly
balanced
crisp
tasting
lager
however
awkward
that
sounds
at
any
rate
still
a
great
beer
i
guess
i
was
just
misled
by
the
label
lime
seared
tuna
triple
sec
marinated
salmon
sure
the
toasted
lager
poured
a
copperish
color
with
a
decent
size
head
it
definitely
looks
fantastic
to
drink
this
beer
definitely
follows
through
on
the
taste
as
well
its
rich
but
not
filling
and
you
can
definitely
taste
the
toasted
in
it
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
back
relax
and
enjoy
im
definately
on
board
with
this
one
great
session
beer
as
well
as
just
for
a
tasting
would
love
to
make
a
homebrew
clone
of
this
cheers
to
blue
point
drinkability
pretty
damn
drinkable
thanks
to
the
lower
abv
clean
and
refreshing
definitely
a
go
to
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
hands
down
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
could
be
a
good
everyday
goto
beer
d
this
is
a
great
beer
will
buy
again
a
superb
beer
with
a
truly
original
taste
and
feel
the
toasted
lager
pours
a
copper
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
behind
minimal
lacing
a
little
bit
of
a
floral
hop
aroma
but
not
much
else
there
mouthfeel
is
thin
crisp
up
front
having
a
hard
time
picking
up
the
toasted
part
of
this
lager
has
a
slightly
bitter
finish
doesnt
compare
with
some
of
blue
points
other
offerings
da
good
crisp
lager
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
brooklyn
lager
i
still
prefer
brooklyn
to
this
for
the
most
part
this
beer
looked
beautiful
the
copper
almost
shined
after
that
its
a
solid
lager
it
just
doesnt
taste
as
great
as
it
looked
clear
amber
appearance
with
some
thin
lacing
faint
malt
with
some
spice
aromas
were
sensed
nothing
too
strong
not
too
toasty
but
it
did
have
a
sweet
hoppy
taste
to
it
good
medium
body
but
a
bit
too
watery
overall
i
felt
like
the
drink
could
have
better
but
its
watery
texture
hindered
any
potential
it
could
have
had
simply
just
too
weak
for
my
tastes
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
to
spend
some
time
with
went
down
easy
and
tasted
good
throughout
tasted
on
31008
d
drinkability
was
warm
and
toasty
making
for
a
big
drinking
lager
with
a
big
flavor
d
could
be
a
good
entry
level
type
craft
beer
not
really
my
style
but
i
could
see
many
considering
this
drinkable
i
had
this
when
it
first
came
out
and
it
seems
like
it
has
improved
a
bit
the
presentation
is
quite
nice
in
that
it
pours
a
coppery
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
bubbly
head
with
lots
of
retention
and
lacing
the
beer
is
clear
and
moderately
carbonated
the
smell
is
very
subdued
im
getting
some
sweet
malts
husky
grains
some
very
typical
lagery
yeast
aromas
maybe
some
florals
too
the
taste
is
malty
a
bit
tilted
in
the
direction
of
caramel
there
is
some
hop
in
the
finish
im
getting
some
crystal
malt
flavors
some
slightly
toasted
grains
some
reddish
flavors
in
the
background
there
is
a
slight
sourishness
to
this
beer
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
that
detracts
somewhat
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
brilliant
but
refreshing
enough
in
the
right
circumstances
drinkability
is
up
there
a
very
enjoyable
beer
glad
i
picked
it
up
d
very
complete
lager
imo
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
balanced
not
very
filling
which
allows
this
to
be
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amberorange
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
drop
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
aroma
is
biscuits
malt
and
little
else
toasty
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
bitter
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
is
creamy
thick
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
a
decent
if
unremarkable
lager
an
excellent
candidate
to
offer
a
macro
drinker
as
a
crossover
beer
gorgeous
clear
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
foamy
head
and
bubbles
climbing
up
the
sides
malt
a
toastedlike
scent
really
in
the
nose
with
the
same
in
the
initial
taste
nicely
balanced
fruitybitter
hops
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
brings
the
whole
beer
together
the
toasty
flavor
is
apparent
and
actually
quite
unique
and
flavorful
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
could
be
enjoyed
over
and
over
again
very
smooth
and
drinkable
serve
this
to
your
macroloving
friends
when
youre
introducing
them
to
micros
theyll
be
hooked
d
tasty
lager
with
a
very
clean
palate
and
lots
of
flavor
the
toasted
quality
really
stands
out
in
this
brew
not
particularly
complex
but
certainly
aptly
named
aftertaste
is
still
malty
and
a
bit
chewy
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
lagers
this
is
a
versitile
beer
that
will
as
the
great
john
molson
once
said
make
its
own
friends
mouthfeeldrinkability
sharp
in
the
mouth
especially
on
the
outset
it
doesnt
smooth
out
very
well
through
the
duration
either
overall
this
beer
was
definitely
a
letdown
considering
what
i
have
previously
heard
about
it
this
brew
poures
to
a
copper
color
with
a
fair
sized
slightly
off
white
head
which
seems
to
have
some
staying
power
fair
amount
of
lacing
being
left
down
the
side
of
the
glass
imo
presentation
is
pretty
good
the
aroma
is
nice
clear
malt
scent
that
goes
along
with
its
name
as
it
gives
a
nice
toasted
scent
mixed
with
a
nice
hop
presence
the
taste
is
quite
smooth
with
the
front
end
has
a
nice
malt
flavor
again
slightly
toasted
with
a
slight
fruit
like
presence
the
tail
end
shows
off
a
nice
hop
presence
that
seems
to
coat
the
back
of
the
mouth
to
give
the
feeling
of
the
hops
sticking
around
for
a
while
quite
easy
drinking
brew
possibly
not
a
sessional
one
for
me
just
due
to
the
hop
presence
and
residual
taste
take
this
with
a
grain
of
salt
as
i
am
not
usually
one
to
have
a
very
hoppy
brew
as
a
sessional
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
some
nice
flavors
coming
out
this
is
a
keeper
copped
a
single
12oz
beer
for
1
49
at
wine
and
more
in
west
orange
glad
i
only
got
one
because
even
though
this
is
an
allaround
good
brew
its
nothing
exotic
or
above
and
beyond
the
appearance
was
better
than
average
with
a
decent
foam
head
smell
was
somewhat
bland
and
didnt
really
have
a
strong
aroma
the
taste
was
crisp
clear
and
went
down
really
smooth
no
prob
at
all
drinking
a
clearcut
brew
like
this
although
i
wouldnt
want
to
run
out
to
buy
a
sixer
of
this
it
was
a
nice
sample
that
i
did
enjoy
recommended
blue
point
brewing
company
is
a
great
brewery
almost
all
their
beers
are
top
notch
the
toasted
lager
is
my
favorite
nice
lager
taste
and
color
very
refreshing
any
time
of
year
a
great
hoppy
bite
right
there
for
you
to
taste
but
not
overpowering
at
all
a
great
beer
to
have
when
you
plan
to
have
12
or
so
not
filling
at
all
love
it
pours
a
vibrant
amber
with
dark
gold
highlights
and
great
head
retention
the
aromas
are
of
buttery
toasted
grains
with
hints
of
earthy
hops
and
hazelnuts
on
the
palate
theres
some
nice
aciditysourness
first
off
before
things
dry
a
bit
into
some
toasty
grape
nut
flavors
the
finish
is
a
bit
sour
and
clings
to
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
with
good
acidity
and
perfect
carbonation
overall
a
very
solid
lager
but
nothing
too
special
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
balance
of
carbonation
overall
very
drinkable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
mediumlight
as
far
as
body
is
concerned
with
a
crisp
finish
the
remnants
of
the
head
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
its
nice
nothing
spectacular
perhaps
a
good
transition
for
rookie
bas
md
subtle
flavors
that
move
around
smoothly
and
cleanly
in
the
mouth
thats
one
characteristic
that
ive
taken
from
lagers
that
theyre
very
clean
tasting
this
toasted
lager
doesnt
stray
far
from
the
middle
of
the
pack
but
it
doesnt
disappoint
either
i
would
definitely
have
another
bottle
or
order
another
pint
recommended
pours
a
light
copper
hue
with
a
hint
of
amber
nice
two
finger
off
white
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
frothy
goodness
stickiness
is
pretty
good
some
spotty
lacing
leaving
its
mark
smell
is
of
buttery
noble
hops
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
in
there
as
well
ok
but
not
the
best
smelling
beer
by
any
means
taste
starts
off
with
a
dry
caramel
malt
and
some
sweet
candy
like
sugar
aftertaste
is
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
with
a
popcorn
like
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
smooth
lightmedium
body
with
a
noticable
carbonation
tingle
pretty
good
drinkability
but
there
are
definitely
more
lagers
out
there
id
prefer
this
was
a
tough
beer
for
me
to
review
it
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
a
pretty
decent
example
of
an
amber
lager
i
didnt
pour
this
decent
lager
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
that
i
wasnt
expecting
had
that
nice
roasted
or
shall
i
say
toasted
flavor
fairly
smooth
but
again
with
that
bite
not
as
smooth
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
would
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
had
a
nice
fullflavor
though
and
the
bite
wasnt
too
bad
im
not
a
hophead
so
thats
why
i
mention
the
bite
all
the
time
this
was
balaced
fairly
well
though
worth
a
try
id
say
pours
a
very
nice
amber
with
an
orange
hue
thin
off
white
headwith
excellent
retentionand
lacing
aroma
is
of
honeyand
sweet
malts
nicebut
a
bit
weak
body
is
light
to
mediumwith
some
carbionation
taste
is
of
sweet
fruitand
honeywith
a
nice
little
hop
balance
not
bad
got
this
on
tap
at
the
mews
in
wakefield
ri
despite
the
dim
lighting
in
the
bar
this
one
was
a
nice
golden
amber
without
much
head
to
speak
of
though
perhaps
that
had
more
to
do
with
the
pour
than
the
beer
i
didnt
notice
much
of
a
nose
to
this
one
smelled
clean
good
for
the
style
but
nothing
impressive
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
smooth
with
some
hop
bitterness
to
keep
it
interesting
id
almost
describe
it
as
an
amber
ale
dialed
down
to
mute
the
beer
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
ordered
a
second
one
worth
a
try
overall
an
interesting
lager
pleasing
at
first
but
it
didnt
persist
after
warming
drank
cold
this
would
be
much
better
pours
a
brilliant
colour
reddish
orange
very
clear
just
amazing
thick
white
head
lots
of
lace
great
retention
head
never
leaves
i
have
to
give
this
a
5
for
appearance
simply
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
ive
ever
seen
smell
is
sweet
very
malty
bit
of
toast
floral
almost
adjuncty
corn
disappointing
taste
is
much
better
sweet
caramel
floral
citrus
very
fruity
hops
very
assertive
citric
bitterness
malty
toast
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
flavour
is
really
nice
appearance
is
amazing
smell
kind
of
turned
me
off
maybe
better
aroma
when
fresh
still
good
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
nice
copper
color
but
poured
with
relatively
no
head
and
only
mild
lacing
there
is
not
much
aroma
to
comment
on
slightly
malty
and
grassy
but
nothing
distinct
i
had
anticipated
a
richer
or
mildly
smoky
aroma
similarly
i
anticipated
that
in
its
taste
as
well
however
instead
it
tasted
like
a
basic
lager
with
a
faint
roasted
malt
and
mild
sweetness
it
is
a
decent
lager
but
not
as
interesting
as
i
had
hoped
on
the
upside
it
is
a
nice
tasting
beer
and
easy
to
drink
it
was
a
welcome
refreshment
on
a
hot
saturday

of
caramel
the
taste
is
kinda
sweet
malty
hoppy
nice
little
spice
bite
and
lots
of
caramel
there
is
a
nice
clean
finish
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
amber
lager
would
recommended
i
wouldnt
deny
that
this
is
decently
brewed
but
its
simply
so
uninteresting
even
if
seeking
a
simple
summertime
lager
fantastically
insipid
the
best
description
may
just
be
meh
good
nuttyness
due
to
the
toasting
leads
off
this
highly
drinkable
if
unexciting
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
malts
lead
off
with
the
nuttyness
and
hops
dont
really
appear
until
the
finish
imparting
a
tealike
quality
i
mentioned
in
the
aroma
pleasant
though
uninspiring
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
could
make
a
nice
session
beer
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
my
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
offwhite
foam
that
leaves
a
slight
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
as
the
name
suggests
of
sweet
malt
and
bread
along
with
crisp
fruit
taste
is
again
of
sweet
toasted
malts
followed
by
a
nice
dose
of
mildly
bitter
fruity
hops
finish
is
also
clean
and
slightly
dry
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
i
wish
i
would
have
thrown
more
than
one
of
these
into
my
mixed
sixer
well
done
had
on
draft
at
friscoes
grille
columbia
md
pours
a
deep
gold
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
it
smells
malty
sweet
with
a
slight
nuttiness
tasted
malty
sweet
a
hint
of
roasted
toasted
malt
and
a
slight
dry
finish
it
was
fairly
smooth
thin
to
medium
on
the
tongue
but
did
not
linger
overall
a
decent
american
lager
which
woud
be
tasty
on
a
warm
day
this
was
a
nice
light
malty
alternative
on
a
hot
afternoon
pleasant
to
drink
no
flaws
but
nothing
special
either
a
nice
easygoing
beer
not
trying
too
hard
good
at
being
what
it
is
bottom
line
i
like
this
amber
lager
and
i
thank
jwc215
for
including
this
in
our
trade
easy
enough
to
drink
but
rather
bland
even
for
the
style
nothing
special
about
it
d
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
but
without
enough
of
a
presence
to
really
hold
up
to
that
second
or
third
bottle
file
this
under
mixpack
as
a
side
note
i
had
a
taste
of
this
beer
that
my
girlfriend
got
ontap
it
definitely
tasted
better
so
i
recommend
a
draft
of
this
over
a
bottle
of
it
prosit
und
zun
wohl
mk
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
frothy
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
spotty
lacing
carbonation
is
big
to
begin
with
but
settles
and
is
fairly
consistant
if
mellow
smells
attractive
the
toasted
malts
are
sweet
and
bready
theyre
also
prominent
on
the
tongue
but
theyre
balanced
by
a
faint
bitter
hop
thick
body
for
a
lager
but
easily
quaffed
another
good
showing
from
blue
point
and
a
great
example
of
what
can
be
done
with
an
american
lager
d
at

this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
easily
pound
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
or
on
the
coldest
darkest
winter
night
the
beer
came
out
of
the
tap
ice
cold
the
taste
is
light
and
a
bit
caramely
when
going
down
and
sitting
in
my
mouth
but
the
aftertaste
enhanced
by
the
cold
temperature
was
sharp
and
lingering
tasted
great
to
me
d
the
aftertaste
does
not
leave
you
really
wanting
to
taste
more
of
it
though
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
5

abv
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
very
filling
it
might
be
a
good
transitional
beer
for
those
that
are
trying
to
ease
their
way
into
craft
beer
however
i
prefer
something
more
flavorful
and
with
more
of
a
kick
to
it
the
aroma
promises
more
than
the
flavor
can
deliver
and
thats
not
for
want
of
trying
but
its
just
too
onedimensional
and
thin
at
that
once
it
hits
the
palate
though
it
is
still
refreshing
in
its
way
and
drinkable
as
a
consequence
it
seems
to
have
won
a
medal
but
while
i
will
eventually
finish
what
i
have
of
this
i
have
to
wonder
at
the
level
of
the
competition
i
think
this
is
a
beer
that
would
benefit
by
a
beating
hot
sun
and
a
demanding
thirst
would
be
a
very
good
session
lager
overall
maybe
a
little
past
its
prime
probably
better
right
off
tap
otherwise
nothing
special
here
all
in
all
pretty
drinkable
has
hints
of
a
roasted
almost
nutty
flavor
as
well
a
nice
buy
if
you
can
find
it
cheers
i
was
intrigued
by
the
toasted
lager
label
and
decided
to
give
this
one
a
whirl
this
beer
poured
deep
golden
color
and
had
huge
foamy
head
but
that
didnt
last
very
long
it
didnt
have
much
of
a
smell
this
was
a
pretty
traditional
tasting
lager
with
a
slightly
nutty
tasting
finish
this
must
be
the
toasted
part
it
was
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
drinkability
definitely
drinkable
some
may
not
like
the
minor
hoppy
bite
but
that
doesnt
bother
me
pours
a
dark
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
the
aromas
are
a
light
roast
caramel
and
some
light
floral
hops
a
nice
and
pleasant
amount
of
malt
too
to
me
this
is
a
good
session
brew
when
a
place
is
serving
it
fresh
i
could
put
back
quite
a
few
of
these
easily
its
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
food
as
well
a
rock
solid
amber
lager
that
hits
the
spot
almost
anytime
this
is
their
most
common
beer
but
blue
point
definitely
makes
better
ones
than
this
so
if
this
is
all
youve
tried
get
out
there
and
sample
the
others
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
its
quite
a
drinkable
beer
but
there
are
much
better
beers
from
blue
point
overall
id
reccoemmend
it
if
youre
looking
for
something
easy
to
pick
up
and
drink
but
if
youre
feeling
adventurous
id
look
elsewhere
around
their
brewery
a
very
drinkable
beerrefreshing
and
quite
enjoyableit
could
use
a
little
more
hop
presence
to
balance
out
the
malt
overallnot
a
bad
beerwould
drink
this
again
ive
been
a
fan
of
the
last
couple
offerings
from
blue
point
for
as
many
adds
ive
seen
about
these
two
breweries
in
beer
publications
its
amazing
ive
never
seen
them
appears
a
nice
copper
amber
hue
with
a
nice
off
whtie
head
leaves
even
webbed
lacing
as
it
slowly
dwindles
away
aroma
has
a
mild
zingling
pinecitrus
hop
combo
with
some
toasted
grain
brings
about
light
nutbiscuit
components
and
a
trace
of
caramel
presence
but
i
was
taken
a
back
from
the
hops
i
was
picking
up
especially
for
a
flagship
lager
taste
contains
a
mix
of
mineral
tones
caramel
biscuit
malts
and
expressive
hop
flavors
including
pine
and
citrus
with
mild
overall
bitterness
the
malts
were
very
nice
toasty
as
the
label
describes
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
body
range
even
natural
carbonation
some
light
hop
slick
oily
feeling
about
it
damn
drinkability
comes
off
with
a
classic
flavorful
lager
damn
tasty
good
hop
presence
and
i
could
drink
these
all
day
definitely
a
fan
of
this
and
the
hoptical
illusion
the
subsequent
taste
was
very
smooth
malty
and
slightly
bitter
it
didnt
explode
with
huge
fruit
but
it
easy
to
drink
and
would
probably
be
great
on
draft
lying
somewhere
between
an
american
amber
and
a
vienna
a
nice
sessionable
lager
this
beer
is
courtesy
of
one
of
my
old
college
friends
that
lives
in
this
area
of
long
island
the
beer
poured
a
medium
amber
color
and
formed
a
foamy
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
a
mild
aroma
of
hops
grain
and
banana
the
flavor
was
slightly
of
hops
and
grain
a
medium
light
body
and
a
sweet
finish
not
a
bad
session
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
very
slight
head
smells
of
malt
and
roasty
nuts
mmm
roasty
nuts
tastes
almost
like
a
nut
brown
ale
but
with
a
little
hop
hint
also
a
little
citrus
comes
back
on
the
aftertaste
a
good
lager
very
drinkable
offering
from
the
patchogue
brewery
comments
i
enjoyed
this
lager
from
blue
point
but
did
not
find
it
overly
exciting
more
full
flavored
than
your
standard
lager
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
would
have
liked
it
to
be
more
toasty
per
the
name
d
drinkable
but
not
overly
impressive
blue
point
makes
some
good
offerings
so
id
try
this
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
summer
lager
otherwise
pass
this
beer
has
really
improved
over
the
years
a
simple
easy
drinking
lager
an
excellent
session
beer
with
a
good
flavor
my
new
local
favorite
ah
what
a
treat
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
exceptional
but
this
turned
out
to
be
a
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
lager
for
those
tired
of
the
ubiquity
of
hops
this
toasted
lager
is
a
taste
bud
sanctuary
it
pours
a
nice
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
foamy
though
short
lasting
head
the
smell
is
malty
with
hints
of
yeast
the
taste
is
pleasantly
flavorful
what
does
that
mean
give
it
a
try
and
you
will
knoew
a
very
nice
brew
i
wish
i
had
not
waited
so
long
to
give
this
a
try
being
as
i
am
so
local
to
the
brewery
i
managed
to
score
a
keg
of
this
for
my
housewarming
party
and
it
went
over
great
wow
i
loved
this
lager
it
poured
a
dark
blonde
basically
a
light
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
initially
sour
musty
with
a
sweet
fruity
background
followed
by
a
oaky
vanilla
flavor
the
taste
is
fantastic
caramel
brown
sugar
vanilla
sugar
cookies
are
all
upfront
with
a
pungent
spicy
lemon
citrus
background
for
balance
this
is
a
playful
lager
that
tantalizes
the
palate
with
sweet
and
funky
notes
i
think
drinking
this
out
of
a
bottle
tho
might
leave
a
little
to
be
desired
this
is
a
pint
beer
due
to
its
not
overwhelming
characteristics
meaning
that
you
need
to
really
drink
a
good
helping
of
this
guy
to
really
appreciate
whats
going
on
the
paltry
12
oz
serving
common
to
us
bottles
isnt
going
to
impress
poured
a
crystal
clear
deep
amber
color
with
modest
white
puffy
head
that
slowly
fell
to
a
thin
coating
with
no
lacing
smell
is
mild
for
toasted
malt
and
a
slight
metallic
note
taste
is
malty
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
the
same
metallic
taste
as
in
the
smell
is
also
in
the
background
nice
refreshing
finish
with
a
nice
balcance
of
the
malt
and
hops
a
nice
pleasurable
beer
with
excellent
drinkablility
overallive
had
many
amber
lagers
that
put
this
to
shame
but
that
by
no
means
makes
this
a
bad
choice
lighter
version
of
the
style
not
too
bad
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
brew
not
a
big
beer
but
a
wellcrafted
enjoyable
beer
that
has
good
balance
some
complexity
but
is
approachable
and
drinkable
for
those
times
when
you
want
a
good
lager
with
real
flavor
a
lager
that
might
even
win
over
your
litebeer
drinking
friends
this
beer
is
similar
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
in
all
respects
i
find
it
however
to
be
a
bit
hoppier
and
a
bit
less
malty
both
of
which
add
to
its
drinkability
drinkability
was
strictly
average
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
around
better
than
a
macro
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
micros
with
more
going
for
them
while
this
is
exactly
without
an
aroma
it
is
low
enough
in
intensity
that
if
it
were
a
fart
no
one
could
pinpoint
the
origin
enough
to
lay
blame
on
any
one
person
vaguely
hoppy
is
all
i
can
say
tea
colored
thin
filmy
white

slight

theres
a

with
maybe

all
in

this

just

satisfying
medium
bodied
with

moderate

not
a
big
lager
drinker
but
this
is
a
pretty
solid
one
picked
this
up
as
a
single
but
i
might
by
a
6
pack
for
around
the
house
overall
a
good
looking
beer
with
a
better
aroma
than
flavor
it
is
difficult
to
judge
due
to
the
catchall
character
of
its
style
category
but
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
lager
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass

and
there

is
somewhat
generically
well
balanced
with
light
malt
and
hops
presences
taste
is
balanced
as
well
with
a
bit
somewhat
sour
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
average
and
drinkability
is
limited
by
that
sourness
not
a
favorite
here
has
this
on
tap
at
donnelys
public
house
in
fairport
ny
this
came
to
me
with
a
good
head
with
great
lacing
the
body
was
a
really
good
looking
amber
shade
the
smell
was
sorta
toasty
and
hoppy
simple
but
nice
the
taste
was
nice
besides
the
odd
metallic
flavor
i
noticed
roasted
malt
and
good
hops
to
balance
nothign
special
but
pleasant
moderate
mouthfeel
moderately
drinkable
this
is
a
good
beer
i
know
from
touring
the
place
that
the
color
comes
from
the
boiler
being
either
on
or
off
which
means
the
sugar
is
caramelizing
giving
this
its
color
its
not
smoky
the
only
thing
thats
weird
are
the
floaters
recommended
i
will
never
pick
this
one
up
again
a
total
bummer
ultimately
forgettable
this
was
rather
a
disappointment
as
i
am
very
fond
of
blue
points
hoptical
illusion
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
i
wont
be
having
this
beer
ever
again

was

you
call
something
a
toasted

than
it
should
taste
of
toasted

no
it

a
decent

drinkable

what
is

in
there
me
good
enough
body
for

overall
a
nice
lager
perhaps
a
bit
perfumey
but
i
wouldnt
dismiss
this
beer
overall
if
you
like
the
extremely
summery
summer
beers
airy
lagers
with
not
much
to
say
but
a
solid
flavor
and
the
profile
to
allow

for
it
i
wont
again
but
its
nothing

nothing

this

not

either
mild
toasted
quality
lurks
in
the
background
without
asserting
itself
enough
to
qualify
the
name
mouthfeel
was
the
weakest
aspect
kind
of
watery
with
prickly
carbonation
before
the
finish
not
enough
going
on
in
this
brew
to
hold
my
attention
but
not
terrible
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
wouldnt
ask
for
one
either
this
lager
poured
a
clear
coppery
amber
color
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
settled
and
clung
to
the
glass
in
streaks
the
smell
was
lightly
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
though
very
modest
overall
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
light
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
toastiness
lightly
tangy
with
a
mild
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
aftertaste
was
tangy
and
almost
soapy
this
was
an
ok
lager
overall
pretty
decent
crack
at
it
but
its
nothing

not
the
socks
off

make

a

pours
a
golden
almost
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
in
this
one
very
lively
beer
nice
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
that
sticks
around
for
the
full
glass
nothing
much
on
the
smell
other
than
a
nice
maltyness
the
taste
definately
brings
out
a
mild
toasted
flavor
and
maybe
even
a
hint
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
seemed
a
little
thin
to
me
but
had
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
that
compares
very
favorably
to
most
of
the
lagers
out
there
the
toasted
flavor
gives
it
just
enough
of
a
twist
to
make
it
unique
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
yet
slightly
sweet
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
it
has
a
victory
malt
and
lager
yeast
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
it
has
a
light
crystal
malt
feel
with
a
slight
toasted
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
lager
it
has
good
flavor
and
aroma
a
fine
sessions
beer
nothing
here
to
make
me
attempt
handstands
but
posssibly
something
to
use
to
lure
bud
drinkers
away
from
their
bud
habits
i
had
a
few
of
these
i
liked
it
so
much
it
was
tasty
and
you
dont
notice
how
much
you
drink
of
it
a
superb
beer
and
a
nice
surprise
although
i
know
that
my
judgement
of
this
beer
is
slightly
biast
because
i
live
nearby
the
brewery
i
still
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
i
have
tasted
although
i
must
agree
that
i
have
had
it
in
the
bottle
purchased
at
a
local
store
and
it
was
not
as
good
as
the
fresh
distinct
taste
on
tap
at
the
brewery
the
toasted
flavor
is
distinct
and
original
at
least
to
me
and
i
can
drink
it
all
night
and
not
get
tired
of
it
pours
clearish
medium
amber
minimal
head
that
quickly
dissipates
moderately
carbonated
smells
of
toasted
hops
and
alcohol
tastes
follow
with
bitter
toasty
hops
a
little
wheats
and
hints
of
alcohol
skunk
a
light
bodied
lager
wasnt
too
bad
but
nothing
special
this
was
the
first
blue
point
beer
i
tried
as
i
am
sure
is
the
same
with
the
rest
of
you
this
is
a
great
beer
although
when
i
go
to
th
brewery
i
generally
stick
to
the
oatmeal
stout
crop
circle
and
hoptical
illusion
the
toasted
lager
is
a
great
introductory
beer
to
the
blue
point
brewery
where
you
can
see
the
incredile
ingredients
they
use
and
maybe
it
will
tempt
you
enough
to
visit
them
if
you
are
ever
on
long
island
you
gotta
give
them
a
visit
maybe
you
will
see
me
there
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nice
flagship
brew
thanks
lupe
and
bif
10
for
binging
this
one
to
me
nice
coppery
red
color
with
a
small
head
that
left
pretty
good
lacing
behind
not
much
of
any
kind
of
nose
to
speak
of
citrusy
grainy
hoppy
taste
that
was
kind
of
like
malty
lemon
bread
in
a
bottle
really
refrehing
smooth
and
well
balanced
helped
counter
the
burning
hot
sun
on
the
shadeless
patio
clean
finish
quite
drinkable
im
not
usually
much
of
a
lager
drinker
but
id
pick
up
another
one
of
these
first
sip
reveals
an
average
bodied
brew
with
medium
carbonation
flavor
is
overall
mild
with
some
caramel
mixing
with
a
light
grassy
hop
flavor
the
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
not
sure
why
it
is
called
toasted
lager
drinkability
if
you
were
looking
for
a
malter
basic
lager
this
is
your
ticket
i
was
neither
displeased
or
impressed
by
this
beer
no
real
feelings
for
it
at
all
this
is
thicker
bodied
than
other
lagers
which
gives
it
a
good
mouthfeel
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
relatively
clean
finish
may
not
look
that
good
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
this
very
drinkable
contract
brewed
by
clipper
city
in
baltimore
md
fresh
off
the
bottling
line
from
the
brewery
its
crystal
clear
copper
body
rests
gently
beneath
a
short
head
of
light
tan
foam
that
drops
shortly
to
a
wide
creamy
collar
and
leaves
some
nice
thin
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
exceptionally
clean
with
a
light
note
of
yeasty
fruitiness
and
some
mildly
sweet
and
lightly
toasted
malt
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
its
very
fine
moderate
carbonation
lightly
caresses
the
tongue
before
it
slides
away
effortlessly
the
lightly
toasted
malts
found
in
the
nose
return
in
the
flavor
with
a
bit
of
leafy
hop
flavor
and
some
delicate
berrylike
fruitiness
its
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
that
becomes
quite
apparent
towards
the
swallow
and
leads
into
a
dry
grainy
finish
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
but
never
builds
beyond
that
very
well
brewed
flavor
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
lagery
mellowness
and
very
little
hops
im
not
sure
whats
toasted
about
this
only
a
very
light
toasted
malt
presence
mild
carbonation
medium
body
good
drinkin
on
the
downside
this
one
tasted
like
it
was
on
the
verge
of
going
bad
id
like
to
seek
it
out
ontap
to
get
a
better
sense
of
this
brew
nice
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
clean
but
does
not
seem
like
anything
special
the
taste
is
balanced
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
to
finish
then
it
all
goes
away
no
bready
or
toasted
flavors
the
name
alone
makes
me
look
for
something
extra
which
i
didnt
find
if
it
wasnt
called
toasted
maybe
i
would
not
have
been
disapointed
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
outstanding
easier
to
drink
than
sam
adams
but
very
similar
blue
point
went
a
bit
gimmicky
here
brewing
a
toasted
lager
and
the
result
while
pleasant
doesnt
change
this
brew
from
being
anything
more
than
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
lager
it
pours
a
nice
amber
colour
with
a
decent
head
an
immediate
light
toasted
graininess
is
apparent
in
both
smell
and
taste
there
are
hints
of
bread
throughout
theres
a
bit
more
carbonation
here
than
expected
but
certainly
nothing
overwhelming
every
sip
goes
down
fairly
smooth
as
well
no
compaints
but
nothing
to
rave
about
at
the
same
time
certainly
a
safe
bet
if
you
can
find
it
on
tap
especially
when
youre
in
beer
hell
i
mean
long
island
the
bottle
is
contract
brewed
in
md
and
while
the
tap
version
is
better
and
more
authentic
the
bottle
is
very
good
as
well
golden
amber
color
with
big
fluffy
head
that
laces
appealing
aroma
with
some
mild
hops
and
roasted
grains
the
toasted
aspect
was
a
bit
more
noticeable
on
draft
as
was
the
hop
bitterness
perfectly
smooth
rounded
mouthfeel
some
traces
of
butter
and
metal
in
the
bottled
version
still
a
fine
everyday
drinkable
amber
lager
its
better
than
the
current
sams
boston
lager
and
more
reliable
than
saranacs
adirondack
amber
which
goes
bad
pretty
quickly
i
was
a
big
fan
of
both
those
beers
at
one
time
or
another
and
this
is
a
more
than
adequate
replacement
the
flavor
had
a
little
more
of
the
citrus
and
hop
flavor
i
never
found
the
toasted
flavor
i
actually
let
this
sit
for
a
while
and
tried
it
later
a
little
warmer
still
nothing
still
drinkable
definately
not
in
my
drinking
rotation
but
would
bring
it
to
barbqs
or
tailgait
parties
with
non
beer
educated
beer
drinkers
this
beer
had
an
amber
color
and
a
nice
rocky
head
it
had
a
nice
floral
hoppy
nose
but
it
didnt
jump
out
at
me
the
flavors
were
of
a
normal
lager
beer
i
was
expecting
a
nice
toasty
flavor
which
would
be
rare
in
a
lager
but
couldnt
detect
any
toasted
notes
at
all
i
just
noticed
it
had
a
smoother
taste
than
most
lagers
and
the
hops
had
a
nice
floral
finish
i
am
not
a
big
lager
drinker
so
for
me
nothing
to
write
home
about

overall
the

outdoes
the

at

as
far
as
my
tastebuds
went
this
was
the
fourth
of

that

i
expected
more
out
of
this
but
it
still
wasnt
bad
the
toasted
flavor
was
quite
evident
and
the
aftertaste
was
somewhat
bitter
i
was
still
able
to
finish
a
few
bottles
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
medium
white

the
same
clear
gellike
particles
that
i
just
saw
suspended
in
my
blue

summer
ale
are
present
in
this
beer
also
pretty
subdued
notes
of
malt
and
hops
on
the
nose
the
flameroasted
quality
is
fairly
evident
in
this
brew
it
is
nice
this
is
a
pretty
good
tasting
lager
many
malts
were
employed
to
brew
this
and
they
blend
together
nicely
very
clean
tasting
a
bit
of
a
spritzy
mouthfeel
but
it
isnt
bad
very
little
hop
presence
decent
brew
here
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
with
food
its
smooth
and
crisp
taste
makes
this
one
of
the
lightest
beers
that
has
taste
i
bought
a
brown
jug
of
this
beer
at
a
local
beer
store
and
it
was
really
fresh
and
enjoyable
overall
i
love
ohb
they
make
amazing
offerings
for
this
state
however
this
is
not
one
of
them
i
know
they
plan
on
doing
more
releases
in
the
future
of
the
more
regular
offerings
and
maybe
they
will
offer
up
some
of
their
stouts
in
six
packs
because
that
is
really
where
this
brewery
shines
bought
this
on
a
whim
while
in
n
c
looks
pretty
nice
although
nosetaste
and
feel
are
murky
and
sourish
i
will
not
purchase
this
beer
again
o
very
fresh
well
done
amber
nothing
outstanding
rather
a
fresh
lightly
flavourful
brew
got
at
asheville
at
the
wine
store
near
wicked
weed
although
this
beer
is
ok
for
appearance
and
smell
taste
is
just
ok
the
3
7
alcoholic
content
barely
rates
this
as
a
beer
i
gave
it
a
rating
as
a
one
because
i
want
my
beer
to
be
real
beer
and
not
just
a
beverage
it
didnt
rate
high
enough
in
the
other
areas
to
consider
it
decent
so
i
gave
it
a
low
rating
because
beer
should
be
beer
and
3
alcohol
doesnt
equate
to
beer
in
my
book
have
you
tried
the
rating
scale
on
weak
beverages
im
from
nc
and
i
truly
wanted
to
rate
this
beer
higher
but
honestly
i
cant

this
beer
is

o
overall
at

99
for
22oz
it
was
worth
a
shot
the
mouthfeel
really
distracts
me
from
the
flavor
qualities
that
i
am
digging
here
decent
session
beer
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
good
fora
pour
but
22oz
of
this
is
a
bit
much
for
me
i
mentioned
the
appearance
it
pours
a
dark
ambercopper
color
with
a
thin
head
that
sticks
around
and
doesnt
lace
the
glass
too
much
this
is
a
rather
lightly
flavored
simplistic
sessionable
beer
theres
nothing
special
here
but
nothing
offensive
either
if
you
want
a
lighter
refreshing
beer
this
would
be
a
good
call
o
highly
drinkable
both
because
it
goes
down
easy
and
due
to
the
low
abv
adequate
and
unflawed
flavor
a
good
malthop
balance
and
a
fine
mouthfeel
strong
malty
aroma
has
a
yeasty
overtone
but
is
otherwise
about
average
it
pours
a
clear
dark
coppery
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
slightly
yellowish
light
tan
head
malty
flavor
has
yeasty
and
grassy
notes
with
just
a
hint
of
apple
nothing
special
but
still
enjoyable
texture
is
quite
fizzy
but
just
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
overall
a
decent
if
not
outstanding
brew
o
glad
i
bought
this
now
i
have
another
session
option
if
i
feel
a
little
more
spendy
to
get
a
local
brew
thats
fresh
o
a
very
nice
sessionable
lager
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
smooth
and
creamy
mouth
on
this
one
really
a
mellow
gulper
nice
sweet
malty
backbone
with
plenty
of
nutty
flavor
that
i
really
liked
caramel
and
toffee
notes
noted
this
really
was
a
refreshing
beer
to
sip
while
waiting
for
my
food
i
definitely
much
preferred
this
ontap
to
the
bottle
form
but
this
makes
me
want
to
revisit
it
for
sure
another
solid
offering
from
ohb
amber
to
ruby
in
color
duh
with
a
thin
but
lasting
cream
colored
head
sweet
aromas
with
a
fair
amount
of
nuttiness
caramel
flavored
with
said
nuttiness
minimal
hop
flavors
maybe
some
earthy
hops
for
balance
silky
smooth
mourhtfeel
good
session
beer
pours
a
nice
looking
dark
reddish
orange
almost
ruby
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
nuts
malts
and
a
little
hop
aroma
tastes
of
a
little
slight
hops
tons
of
nuts
and
a
total
ton
of
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
the
best
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
very
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
this
is
where
it
went
downhill
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutmeg
and
burnt
hair
wtf
the
flavor
was
of
burnt
malt
nutmeg
and
the
taste
of
how
burnt
hair
smells
omg
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
holy
christ
this
was
bad
it
was
just
not
appealing
in
any
aspect
burnt
hair
really
if
im
honest
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
if
it
gave
me
a
ruby
everytime
i
took
a
sip
just
not
worth
it
however
i
might
keep
this
in
mind
for
when
i
want
to
play
a
cruel
joke
on
a
notsogood
friend
pours
a
deep
red
maybe
a
tad
lighter
than
something
i
would
call
ruby
but
its
getting
there
the
beer
has
a
medium
head
that
retains
its
self
nicely
some
fruity
and
bready
malt
shows
up
in
the
aroma
along
with
mild
vegetal
notes
generally
it
smells
nice
enough
but
the
aroma
is
pretty
reserved
all
together
the
flavor
is
really
very
nice
and
consequently
a
mildly
roasty
fruity
lager
with
some
mild
snappy
hops
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
im
in
the
mood
for
at
the
moment
im
glad
i
decided
to
open
this
up
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
dig
into
here
its
a
very
clean
cery
malt
forward
beer
that
is
really
well
balanced
with
a
bit
of
zesty
hop
bitterness
very
full
flavored
for
a
4
beer
clean
and
well
balanced
not
much
else
you
can
ask
for
right
easily
marked
as
a
session
beer
and
a
good
one
at
that
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
one
keenly
drinkable
its
got
just
enough
flavor
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
balance
a
slender
body
and
a
graciously
low
abv
i
cleared
through
the
entire
bomber
in
record
time
by
the
time
the
pinback
song
grey
machine
had
finished
i
was
done
another
oh
iffering
that
has
popped
up
here
in
gso
poured
a
clear
amberbronze
with
a
very
minimal
head
that
was
gone
quickly
a
nice
mix
of
caramel
malt
and
toast
in
the
noseit
really
stuck
out
nicely
big
caramel
and
toasted
flavors
with
a
a
light
smack
of
herbal
hop
in
the
finish
its
not
a
world
beaterbut
its
not
bad
for
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
slight
hint
of
hoppiness
that
nicely
balances
out
the
sweeter
honey
flavour
sweet
crisp
fresh
very
easy
drinking
citrus
notes
a
solid
brew
but
nothing
spectacular
draft
poured
a
goldenamber
color
lager
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
aroma
consists
of
light
malt
presence
with
light
sweet
notes
form
honey
taste
is
also
dominated
by
light
caramel
notes
with
sweet
honey
finish
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
this
is
almost
closer
to
a
vienna
then
a
straight
lager
but
refreshing
nonetheless
with
limited
amount
of
complexity
o
the
honey
is
barely
detectable
overall
this
beer
is
inoffensive
easy
to
drink
yet
one
dimensional
and
easily
forgettable
despite
that
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
if
offered
i
wouldnt
look
for
seconds
of
this
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
passed
to
me
just
another
basic
brew
very
drinkable
but
nothing
complex
this
beer
is
refreshing
but
bland
with
almost
no
aftertaste
despite
the
name
im
not
really
tasting
any
honey
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
whistlers
bear
paw
honey
lager
is
much
better
but
im
having
no
problem
getting
through
the
sixpack
i
bought
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
rather
one
of
the
most
flavorless
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
especially
when
compared
to
other
honey
lagers
thin
mouth
feel
and
nonexistent
after
taste
the
beer
starts
out
ok
but
gets
very
boring
as
you
continue
to
drink
since
it
seems
to
lose
its
flavor
nuff
said
avoid
overall
this
is
a
simple
honey
lager
its
refreshing
and
inoffensive
but
also
lacks
any
outstanding
features
if
you
want
an
easy
six
pack
to
drink
id
recommend
d
the
clear
cut
above
the
average
adjunct
lager
but
a
disappointment
overall
the
honey
flavor
is
almost
undetectable
but
the
overall
flavor
profile
is
decent
for
what
it
is
overall
not
very
good
pours
a
golden
orange
no
head
retention
but
leaves
a
decent
lace
smells
of
sweet
citrus
tastes
lightly
of
honey
vanilla
yeast
not
much
of
a
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
light
low
carbonation
this
would
be
a
very
good
cross
over
beer
for
a
macrobeer
drinker
very
light
sweetness
yet
somewhat
complex
a
good
party
beer
d
wouldnt
go
back
to
back
with
this
as
it
exhaustes
the
palate
an
the
throat
overall
pretty
nice
and
very
drinkable
low
abv
makes
it
a
good
session
beer
d
overall
a
tasty
offering
but
nothing
all
that
memorable
easily
drinkable
and
nonoffensive
but
lacking
any
bold
flavours
d
im
not
a
fan
of
the
aroma
and
it
was
turning
me
off
quite
a
bit
the
more
i
drank
otherwise
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
inoffensive
in
that
underwhelming
canadian
honey
lager
pantheon
way
and
easy
enough
to
drink
when
hearts
and
minds
are
focused
elsewhere
across
the
table
or
perhaps
down
the
street
tastes
sweet
honeylike
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
backed
by
a
maltiness
which
reminds
me
of
soaked
malt
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
a
refreshing
hint
of
honey
is
plastered
on
the
can
and
i
will
admit
that
hint
of
honey
is
a
refreshing
difference
between
similar
beers
and
given
the
choice
between
this
and
other
lagers
i
probably
would
pick
this
however
overall
it
is
fairly
bland
and
given
the
choice
between
this
and
some
of
granville
islands
other
offerings
this
would
be
one
of
my
last
choices
the
body
and
drinkability
are
both
typical
for
a
light
lager
overall
while
this
beer
isnt
terrible
with
the
complete
blandness
of
this
brew
why
bother
a
fear
of
hops
and
an
unsubstantiated
fondness
for
honey
seem
to
be
the
unifying
factors
amongst
all
canadian
micro
brewers
i
like
honey
and
i
like
lagers
and
i
love
mead
but
thats
another
thing
yet
curiously
i
rarely
care
for
honey
lagers
in
the
case
of
granville
islands
however
im
as
much
enjoying
this
bottle
as
i
am
yearning
for
another
one
had
a
friend
of
mine
pick
this
up
for
me
while
she
was
out
west
and
ive
heard
a
lot
about
granville
island
but
im
a
little
underwhelmed
its
a
very
basic
clean
lager
with
a
hint
of
honey
sweetness
in
it
i
would
have
liked
it
to
have
a
little
more
bitter
on
the
end
taste
a
lot
like
other
honeys
lagers
ive
had
in
the
past
certainly
on
of
the
better
ones
but
not
all
that
impressed
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
pale
ale
that
i
also
have
all
in
all
decent
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
for
my
self
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
free
d
definitely
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
it
began
with
a
nice
solid
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
before
reducing
to
mere
wisps
the
nose
however
was
pure
honey
it
was
leaning
into
a
beehive
and
taking
a
deep
breath
albeit
without
the
angry
stinging
bees
very
pleasant
the
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
golden
honey
color
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
great
honey
sweetness
on
the
palate
the
finish
lingered
with
the
honey
taste
that
had
been
so
prevalent
throughout
now
for
a
couple
of
caveats
re
my
review
and
the
marks
i
am
generally
not
a
sweet
malty
beer
fan
but
this
was
a
very
different
type
of
sweet
not
cloying
and
very
true
to
its
origin
also
i
like
honey
as
an
alternative
to
sugar
as
a
sweetener
i
feel
like
i
really
blew
it
by
not
buying
more
of
this
one
when
i
had
the
choice
traders
its
unique
with
its
sweet
smell
but
not
girly
i
really
appreciate
that
bottled
version
lacks
the
sweetness
and
is
much
more
skunky
and
industrial
than
the
draught
version
not
a
very
attractive
lager
to
the
palate
or
as
a
drinkable
session
beer
in
the
end
i
would
say
that
this
is
better
than
a
macro
but
certainly
not
an
outstanding
lager
i
dont
think
it
would
be
hard
to
get
macro
drinkers
into
this
beer
though
so
it
may
serve
as
a
nice
gateway
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
small
white
head
forms
goes
quick
but
leaves
a
nice
ring

is
sweet
and
malty
apples
honey
vanilla
and
citrus
taste
is
malty
with
vanilla
citrus
and
yeast
weak
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
flavour
was
pretty
watered
down
there
really
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
beer
while
it
isnt
terrible
it
isnt
that
great
either
might
be
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
one
again
an
average
offering
from
the
granville
island
brewery
but
at
least
they
are
consistent
in
offering
average
beers
its
a
clear
golden
colour
decent
white
head
upon
pour
but
it
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
a
minimal
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
crisp
predominantly
floral
hops
and
the
smallest
bit
of
sweet
malt
this
possesses
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
its
very
satisfying
but
the
flavour
department
isnt
really
home
right
now
its
crisp
but
the
taste
seems
to
be
muted
its
actually
quite
refreshing
just
a
tad
bland
very
smooth
drinking
beer
not
bitter
at
all
meh
for
na
amber
beer
nice
smooth
feel
and
taste
with
no
bitterness
in
the
aftermath
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
classic

pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
small

there
is
a
very
sweet

its
very
odd
and
a
bit
offensive
the
taste
is
very
crisp

nice

good
flavors
a
little

a
very
deep
amber
in
color
with
a
good
1finger
offwhite
cap
that
settles
down
to
just
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
slides
back
down
the
sides
after
a
minute
of
so
the
aroma
is
of
some
roasted
malts
and
some
brown
sugar
little
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
some
caramel
malts
hint
of
spice
dark
fruit
and
yeast
in
the
mix
as
well
a
very
slight
pine
finish
which
adds
some
to
this
brew
no
harsh
or
bitter

is
noted
though
mediumbodied

it
is
a
decent

to
a
thin

is
a
toasty
malt
brown
sugar
and
slightly
fruity
notes

a
touch
of

and
dusty
this
beer
may
be
old
with
toasted
caramel
malt
and
a
weak
waxy
hop
balance
its
not
bad
but
it
is
rather
unremarkable
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
fizzy
much
like
bmc
overall
a
soso
beer
bear
in
mind
i
could
not
find
a
freshness
date
on
this
beer
and
it
was
stored
at
room
temperature
for
lord
only
knows
how
long
in
an
oklahoma
package
store
change
the
damn
law
already
not
too
shabby
in
fact
it
goes
down
quite
nicely
looks
the
part
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
have
a
caramel
malt
backbone
paired
with
some
satisfying
pine
notes
good
body
a
pretty
solid
amber
lager
with
more
flavour
than
most
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
smc
this
is
some
smooth
drinking
if
you
want
something
malty
at
66pack
its
hard
to
beat
a
bit
fizzy
for
me
but
others
will
say
its
well
carbonated
no
doubt
a
malty
lager
no
more
no
less
a
decent
middleoftheroadish
amber
lager
decent
but
nothing
particularly
noteworthy
a
fairly
decent
beer
with
a
nice
malt
taste
that
struck
a
good
balance
with
the
sweetness
that
appeared
throughout
the
beer
a
very
pleasant
beer
and
one
ill
pick
up
again
if
it
stays
at
this
price
o
points
amber
drinks
wonderfully
with
its
smooth
profile
making
it
really
too
bad
the
aroma
and
flavor
seem
so
cheap
nice
notes
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
sweetness
are
marred
by
the

that

me
to
believe
that
everything
is

the
lack

leaves
me
wanting

added
in

from
these

the
classic

is
a
very

beer
with

so
far
i
like
every
beer
ive
tried
by
steven

brewery
this
is
a
good
amber
ale
o
a
sweet
and
lively
amber
wish
the
aroma
had
a
larger
presence
pretty
one
flavored
taste
very
drinkable
not
what
i
expected
as
an
amber
hoping
i
got
a
bad
bottle
not
nearly
enough
hop
or
malt
flavor
rather
run
of
the
mill
and
forgettable
if
not
for
a
slightly
betterthanaverage
head
structure
o
i
like
this
beer
its
at
that
balance
point
where
its
not
heavy
that
you
cant
drink
more
than
one
but
not
light
enough
to
have
too
many
of
this
has
been
on
tap
at
my
local
watering
hole
for
quite
some
while
just
realized
i
have
never
reviewed
it
i
think
this
is
prob
the
best
beer
point
makes
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
way
it
looks
very
rich
amber
color
with
a
beautiful
head
that
has
nice
lacing
not
much
aroma
going
on
but
i
do
not
have
the
best
smeller
very
mild
the
flavor
of
this
beer
has
nutty
dried
fruit
and
grain
kind
of
like
a
granola
bar
nice
to
drink
i
am
on
my
second
one
so
it
is
decent

beers
with
robust
strong
character
its
nice
to
have
a
nice
enjoyable
delicious
beer
to
drink
that
does
not
to
do
by
being
strong
as
it
can
do
so
while
being
subtle
give
this
one
a
try
i
would
say
that
it
should
be
rated
more
than
what
ba
together
gives
it
the
more
i
drink
of
this
beer
i
want
to
read
the
flavors
of
vienna
lager
that
fuses
with
american
amber
ale
maltiness
maybe
this
is
what
the
brewery
is
targeting
regardless
it
leads
to
a
very
floral
and
lightly
carmelly
beer
that
could
use
more
citrusy
hop
bitterness
to
balance
this
one
just
becomes
too
sweet
and
onedimensionally
floral
sprechers
amberviennablack
lagers
are
all
better
and
more
classic
than
this
onot
much
to
write
home
about
with
this
one
its
beer
without
much
flavor
or
smell
overall
a
very
sessionable
amber
goes
well
with
red
beans
and
rice
o
this
beer
is
okay
if
your
looking
for
something
like
a
darker
version
of
pbr
overall
ive
had
other
beers
from
this
brewer
that
i
liked
and
im
a
fan
of
amber
ales
i
thought
two
and
two
would
equal
four
but
here
it
apparently
equals
zero
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
overall
i
actually
like
this
more
than
yuenglings
amber
lager
which
is
puzzling
since
its
a
lower
score
notes
meh
just
an
average
beer
pretty
bland
with
just
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
hops
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
fairly
balanced
it
doesnt
wow
but
it
is
quaffable
d
decent
enough
to
say
i
would
drink
one
again
but
would
not
buy
a
sixer
i
would
do
another
single
this
is
not
a
beer
that
will
wow
you
but
it
isnt
terrible
either
this
is
similar
to
the
kids
that
dont
ask
questions
in
class
dont
fail
but
also
do
not
get
great
grades
they
just
attempt
to
go
by
unnoticed
amber
clear
colored
beer
with
a
small
white
fine
head
head
dissapates
very
quickly
some
mild
lacing
there
are
not
many
carbonation
bubbles
its
pretty
plain
looking
smell
is
rather
plain
some
basic
malts
but
they
are
hard
to
pick
out
its
kind
of
bland
taste
is
pretty
smooth
with
some
caramel
malts
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
pretty
smooth
but
not
really
distinctive
its
an
average
amber
at
best
but
reasonably
priced
so
it
gets
some
drinkability
points
light
bodied
light
carbonation
and
smooth
id
not
buy
a
sixpack
but
if
i
was
at
a
bar
and
it
was
on
tap
id
probably
get
one
d
easy
drinker
good
for
a
couple
sort
of
middle
of
the
road
for
the
style
poured
a
watery
chocolate
color
with
alot
of
carbination
the
head
disappeared
almost
immediately
beer
did
not
have
much
of
an
aroma
and
the
flavor
was
a
bit
watered
down
i
did
notice
hints
of
bread
and
coffee
and
aftertaste
of
honey
this
is
just
an
average
beer
i
think
i
would
enjoy
killians
just
as
much
1
thumb
up
from
me
notes
overall
this
comes
off
as
a
nice
average
beer
i
have
always
liked
stevens
point
beer
it
is
one
of
the
original
old
wisconsin
breweries
for
that
reason
alone
we
should
be
buying
and
drinking
their
beers
pretty
much
everything
everybody
else
has
reported
on
this
beer
has
at
least
a
little
of
what
i
would
agree
with
this
came
in
an
assorted
12
pk
that
includes
some
wheat
beers
come
on
over
you
can
drink
them
if
you
want
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
bone
dry
roastedcaramel
malt
flavor
thats
weak
and
watery
it
goes
down
quick
but
finishes
bitter
and
overly
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
your
basic
amber
ale
its
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
with
little
to
get
excited
over
if
i
had
to
give
an
amber
to
somebody
whod
never
had
an
amber
itd
be
this
one
think
about
it
if
the
first
beer
you
have
in
a
style
is
too
good
then
youre
going
to
look
down
uponor
at
least
be
disappointed
withmost
other
attempts
at
that
style
this
is
so
in
the
middle
it
does
everything
its
supposed
to
no
frills
or
surprises
but
also
no
bad
nodes
or
offness
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
also
a
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
very
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
this
started
well
with
my
pour
creating
two
fingers
worth
of
mediumtam
head
with
good
retention
amber
i
would
have
said
rubyred
with
nequality
clarity
this
really
looked
pretty
in
the
glass
nose
had
a
grassy
hop
presence
overlaying
the
malty
sweetness
inherent
in
the
style
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
lightly
hoppy
taste
in
the
mouth
finish
had
a
mild
sweetness
but
i
wanted
more
throughout
it
was
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
it
just
suffered
from
a
mildness
that
could
have
been
avoided
get
the
point
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
a
step
thicker
than
plain
water
so
of
course
this
went
down
pretty
easy
and
i
can
totally
see
this
as
a
session
beer
that
at
least
is
better
than
drinking
bmc
drinkability
not
a
favorite
this
one
tastes
way
to
chemical
like
and
not
well
balanced
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
overall
a
very
middle
of
the
road
amber
drinkable
yes
would
i
pick
it
up
again
no
d
overall
kinda
disappointing
wanted
to
give
point
a
try
and
was
hoping
for
a
solid
amber
but
for
the
style
it
is
lacking
kinda
tasteless
but
certainly
easy
to
drink
i
must
say
that
it
is
a
great
looking
beer
ill
give
em
another
try
i
hear
the
ris
is
good
pours
a
dark
rubyamber
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
falls
to
a
cap
aroma
is
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruity
yeast
esters
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
flavors
of
toasted
malt
are
at
the
center
with
a
light
hop
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
i
think
this
tastes
better
out
of
the
tap
but
not
a
bad
beer
good
drinkability
oh
what
an
eventual
disappointment
this
beer
is
once
it
hits
the
palate
it
pours
from
the
bottle
a
dark
copper
color
there
is
a
faint
fruity
hoppy
aroma
there
is
a
massive
head
which
lasts
for
but
a
few
brief
moments
the
taste
is
bland
with
barely
a
lingual
taste
bud
being
tantalized
the
mouth
feel
is
best
described
as
being
wet
like
drinking
a
class
of
water
i
could
only
recommend
this
beer
for
those
actively
flying
commercial
aircraft
or
doing
extensive
yard
work
on
a
steaming
hot
day
amber
colored
beer
with
a
quick
fading
head
aroma
is
very
weak
faint
malts
taste
is
maltshops
and
light
florals
this
beer
is
as
about
as
boring
and
bland
you
can
get
without
actually
being
bad
it
might
be
nice
to
try
one
but
dont
shoot
yourself
if
you
never
do
drinkability
a
decent
amber
lager
this
beer
is
interchangable
with
almost
any
other
amber
lager
out
there
but
is
still
pretty
good
worth
a
try
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
drinkability
eh
ive
had
better
ambers
and
point
brewery
is
doing
nothing
special
with
this
one
i
feel
ive
pretty
much
summed
up
the
drinkability
portion
already
this
is
a
very
middle
of
the
road
type
amber
however
i
did
not
mind
drinking
it
at
all
and
wouldnt
have
trouble
drinking
it
all
night
long
its
cheap
enough
and
easily
sessionable
d
very
dissapointing
for
its
amber
classification
very
lackluster
in
every
way
almost
bland
dan
easy
session
brew
and
crisp
and
refreshing
enough
for
a
warm
day
amber
color
with
light
prickle
and
little
to
no
head
malty
nose
that
is
heavy
and
rich
clean
attack
that
takes
a
while
to
develop
when
it
does
there
is
a
full
malt
flavor
and
a
thick
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
there
are
some
mild
hints
that
are
reminiscent
of
nut
but
are
just
a
result
of
the
richness
of
the
malt
i
think
easy
to
drink
but
unfortunately
thats
because
there
aint
much
to
it
not
awful
but
not
even
as
good
as
killians
i
suppose
itd
be
a
easy
starter
for
someone
trying
a
beer
darker
than
budlight
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
yeast
cleanliness
slight
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
barely
fiits
the
style
of
an
american
amber
red
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
yeast
cleanliness
up
front
hint
of
hops
and
and
very
faint
sweet
malt
wow
there
is
just
no
real
body
both
the
hop
and
malt
flavors
are
severely
lacking
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
very
faint
caramel
malt
but
mostly
there
is
no
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
stronger
but
mostly
water
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
weak
amber
ale
that
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
again
so
nothing
really
stand
out
but
overall
a
respectible
beer
appearance
is
very
crisp
and
clear
amber
color
with
one
and
a
half
finger
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
smell
is
decent
slightly
sweet
malt
with
an
interesting
spice
combo
and
no
real
hops
to
note
a
touch
of
hops
come
through
in
the
taste
unfortunately
so
does
a
bit
of
metalically
taste
mouthfeel
is
average
light
to
medium
body
and
fizzy
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
drinkability
a
little
more
flavor
and
a
little
different
flavor
than
a
macro
lager
nothing
especially
notable
here
though
might
be
a
good
choice
if
options
are
few
drinkability
for
this
beer
is
pretty
good
give
it
a
try
if
you
find
it
not
bad
overall
interesting
to
say
the
least
this
is
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
for
what
id
assumed
would
be
an
adjunct
lager
type
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
pretty
much
all
maltcaramel
roasted
malt
aroma
and
flavor
are
much
better
as
it
warms
flavor
is

maltsslightly
nutty
with
a
small
touch
of
hops
i
found
this
offering
very
good
and
was
sorry
that
i
had
only
bought
one
drinkable
for
sure
overall
it
is
an
okay
beer
another
mediocre
one
from
point
that
i
probably
wont
need
again
i
used
to
think
this
was
da
bomb
until
i
got
my
craftbeer
feet
wet
deep
mahogany
color
quickly
disaperaing
head
no
lacing
has
a
nice
caramel
malty
slighty
burnt
even
more
slight
nutty
flavor
balance
is
all
right
but
leaves
me
with
a
sweet
finish
could
use
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
flavor
to
balance
the
sweetness
out
better
not
bad
but
nothing
to
kick
your
heels
together
over
either
im
surprised
scores
arent
better
for
this
i
think
people
may
have
let
price
influence
perception
of
quality
this
is
one
of
the
tastiest
lagers
ive
had
and
i
cant
recall
being
able
to
find
something
this
good
for
this
cheap
then
again
i
havent
delved
into
this
style
before
this
beer
so
ill
temper
my
excitement
i
was
tempted
to
score
this
even
higher
in
a
few
spots
it
goes
down
so
easy
too
easy
to
down
a
sixer
considering
the
moderate
abv
the
best
from
point
ive
had
but
their
belgian
white
and
augsburger
golden
lager
hold
their
own
too
d
i
could
get
along
with
a
couple
two
or
three
of
these
quite
sessionable
i
havent
had
a
stevens
point
brew
since
college
over
10
years
ago
they
have
quite
a
few
more
interesting
offerings
than
they
did
back
then
thanks
d
i
think
this
beer
is
a
little
underrated
possibly
because
the
name
has
you
expecting
an
amber
ale
not
a
marzenoktoberfest
very
sessionable
d
this
is
either
a
slightly
below
average
amber
ale
or
a
really
shitty
oktoberfest
i
personally
disagree
with
the
classification
of
this
beer
as
an
ofest
and
im
rating
it
as
if
it
were
and
american
amber
lager
this
aint
bad
for
the
price
but
its
not
all
that
great
either
i
enjoyed
this
beer
last
night
although
it
was
the
last
beer
of
the
night
it
held
up
to
the
killians
and
others
i
had
last
night
i
do
say
this
is
really
a
beer
i
will
enjoy
in
the
future
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
other
beers
this

finish
is

light

fruity

and
a

nutty
ending
overall
not
a
very
robust
brew
in
flavor
and
aroma
just
an
ok
brew
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
nicely
drinkable
there
is
the
standard
smooth
feel
that
is
easy
going
down
and
leaves
just
a
slight
after
taste
that
hangs
a
bit
longer
then
is
needed
but
does
not
take
anything
off
the
experience
o
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
beer
fairly
sweet
and
malty
not
likely
to
be
one
that
i
would
grab
again
from
an
undated
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
july
9
2012
it
pours
a
medium
to
dark
amber
that
could
also
be
classified
as
golden
bronze
with
a
smallish
head
that
fades
after
a
few
moments
the
aroma
oozes
sweetness
with
dark
malts
nuts
and
a
low
profile
hop
ester
the
body
is
medium
and
smooth
the
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
upfront
with
a
low
to
medium
bitterness
taking
up
the
tail
the
bitterness
seems
to
evolve
as
the
beer
warms
this
was
an
easy
to
drink
likable
beer
heavy
mouthfeel
smooth
and
good
aftertaste
slightly
macro
tease
but
overall
a
nice
brew
this
is
a
sturdy
well
made
nofrills
amber
lager
that
is
similar
in
stature
and
yet
more
approachable
than
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
beautiful
clear
amber
color
warm
malt
flavors
and
a
slight
hoppy
finish
are
a
fitting
tribute
to
the
storied
fishermen
of
glostah
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
deserves
a
spot
in
any
new
england
beer
collection
not
much
to
say
about
this
overall
beer
pours
a
decent
looking
clear
amber
with
only
a
14
inch
of
head
that
quickly
turns
to
nothing
smells
of
caramel
grain
and
a
touch
of
grain
pretty
much
yuengling
lager
only
less
skunky
grain
but
not
much
better
overall
its
a
pretty
nice
amber
mostly
lager
beer
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
pours
a
nice
amber
with
subtle
red
hues
very
good
clarity
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
theres
12
fingers
width
of
off
white
colored
head
which
quickly
dissipates
to
almost
nothing
and
leaves
no
appreciable
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
malts
including
caramel
and
sweet
bread
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
floral
character
quite
good
for
the
style
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
sweet
character
of
caramel
malts
a
bready
presence
and
a
decent
amount
of
spice
again
for
the
style
this
is
quite
good
medium
bodiedwith
an
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
crisp
feel
a
rather
unremarkable
mouthfeel
but
drinkability
is
good
overall
a
good
example
of
a
style
that
never
really
lights
the
world
on
fire
a
sessionable
beer
and
a
reasonable
selection
if
you
are
looking
for
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
with
more
flavor
than
your
average
lager
o
this
beer
is
solid
not
spectacular
not

would

poured
a
amber
color
with
not
much
head
there
was
a
nice
malty
smell
with
hints
of
something
sweet
maybe
cinnamon
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
hoppy
harsh
finish
it
takes
like
a
fancy
yuengling
it
does
blend
nicely
but
still
has
a
harshness
with
the
after
taste
it
is
a
bit
of
a
harsh
beer
but
from
other
beers
of
this
style
it
is
easier
to
drink
then
them
overall
i
found
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
especially
having
much
yuengling
this
is
a
very
nice
step
up
poured
a
nice
amber

without
very
much
head
what
little
there
was
was
white
and
very

sweet
flowers
taste
is
malty
sweet
hardly
hopped
very
smooth
slightly
bitter
at
the
finish
drunk
from
a
chimay
chalice
which
may
have
influenced
the
experience
o
a
welldone
tasty
amber
would
buy
again
o
this
beer
is
quite
malty
and
has
associated
sweetness
but
this
doesnt
really
get
in
the
way
of
the
drinkability
d
okay
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
decent
easy
drinking
amber
lager
odbrewed
close
to
home
but
this
is
one
of
those
lowertier
sixpack
beers
for
me
i
could
spend
the
same
amount
of
money
and
get
an
ipswich
sixer
or
even
a
finest

ipa
or
some
leatherlips
just
not
cutting
it
medium
bodied
malty
and
spicy
bready
with
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
but
its
quickly
balanced
out
with
spicy
and
slightly
bitter

that
lend
to
a
dry
and

my

instant
favorite
this

im
hoping
that
time
has
not
been
kind
to
this
beer
at
all
cause
i
kinda
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
if
i
come
across
a
fresh
bottle
will
definitely
give
it
another
far
shot
notes
a
straight
forward
and
solid
amber
lager
a
good
to
one
pick
up
cheers
nice

very
drinkable

very
sweet

fruity
it
has
large
bubbles
yet
still
feels
slightly
undercarbonated
in
the

overall
i
am
not
very
impressed
with
this
beer
d
i
generally
prefer
a

there

i
look

with
much
anticipation
to
their
next

for
the
style
im
very
impressed
very
smooth
could
move
into
my
new
regular
beer
spot
in
the
fridge
o
i
really
like
this
style
and
i
really
like
this
beer
i
used
to
have
yuengling
lager
as
my
go
to
canned
format
but
this
has
less
of
that
bubblegummy
estery
thing
going
on
and
all
the
right
malt
yeast
and
mild
hops
flavors
i
do
not
see
why
this
is
not
more
popular
out
in
western
pa
and
certainly
more
popular
than
yuengling
it
should
be
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
some
grains
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
malty
some
caramel
a
bit
of
grains
and
breadiness
tasty
and
easy
drinking
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
overall
an
ok
amber
lager
overcarbonation
is
just
too
biting
to
allow
for
potential
pleasant
flavors
in
the
mouthfeel
less
adjunct
and
more
caramel
in
the
taste
would
assist
in
flavor
presentation
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
white
head
retention
is
fair
receding
to
a
light
topping
and
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
of
spent
grains
and
corn
in
the
taste
adjunct
rice
and
grain
mix
with
faint
malt
hops
are
somewhat
sour
but
faint
enough
to
hang
in
the
background
light
bodied
and
crisp
mouthfeel
though
watery
overall
this
is
a
very
average
offering
strikes
me
as
a
pour
mans
oktoberfest
the
malts
are
nice
and
carry
the
flavor
not
overly
carbonated
which
is
really
nice
the
biggest
issue
it
should
be
enjoyed
very
cold
or
it
comes
off
as
sour
ive
had
4
during
an
afternoon
of
hockey
viewing
so
id
say
it
was
smooth
in
2
frosted
pint
glasses
taste
is
very
rich
for
a
20
dollar
case
of
beer
mouthfeel
is
balanced
maybe
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
good
this
is
a
really
nice
local
beer
with
a
great
history
behind
it
some
may
find
this
silly
but
ive
always
been
one
to
stay
away
from
whats
popular
yuenglings
traditional
lager
falls
into
that
category
if
you
also
prefer
to
walk
the
path
less
trodden
i
would
really
recommend
trying
this
brew
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
smooth
character
with
a
decent
price
tag
attached
this
beer
is
about
as
boring
as
it
gets
but
is
a
step
above
an
michelob
amber
boch
or
something
like
that
one
of
those
amber
versions
of
macrobrews
that
just
smells
like
a
sticky
beer
pong
table
and
doesnt
taste
much
better
overall
i
think
that
this
is
a
solid
beer
considering
i
only
payed
15
dollars
for
a
case
on
sale
straub
another
old
brewery
from
my
home
state
of
pa
made
a
pretty
good
beer
here
to
compete
with
yuengling
it
seems
and
i
would
much
prefer
this
to
a
yuengling
any
day
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
light
on
the
palate
yet
still
retains
a
good
amount
of
flavor
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
from
a
pa
brewery
although
i
am
on
the
other
side
of
the
state
i
like
to
keep
it
local
or
regional
if
you
will
i
really
enjoyed
the
roasted
maltsmokey
character
of
this
brew
as
i
said
it
loses
a
bit
on
the
watery
mouthfeel
almost
to
the
point
where
i
feel
as
if
im
drinking
a
light
beer
however
the
roasted
aftertaste
and
drinkability
make
up
for
it
well
see
how
i
feel
about
it
once
this
keg
is
done
this
is
a
good
inexpensive
beer
in
pennsylvania
its
made
with
pa
mountain
spring
water
from
the
laurel
run
reservoir
its
advertised
as
a
beer
that
contains
no
added
sugars
salts
preservatives
or
synthetic
chemicals
making
it
known
as
the
natural
choice
yet

overall
a
great
session
amber
brew
easy
to
drink
not
adjucty
beer
with
a
pretty
good
taste
and
feel
overall
its
just
as
good
as
the
groundhog
brew
but
seems
to
be
in
regular
rotation
if
the
price
matches
or
is
cheaper
than
yuengling
this
will
be
a
staple
in
my

very
easy
drinking
something
i

it

in

years
pours
a

it

fresh
and

made
for

trying
to
stay
afloat
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
with
even
keeled
carbonation
nothing
overbearing
or
off
on
the
palate
overall
a
well
made
refreshing
amber
lager
up
there
with
similar
products
like
yuengling
notes
similar
to
yuengling
traditional
lager
but
not
as
good
and
not
as
hoppy
nice
burnt
orange

good

hop
forward
with
a

on

very
good

beer
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
i
have
tried
from
shorts
it
is
an
enjoyable
hoppy
amber
ale
really
a
tasty
beer
a
highly
hopped
amber
lager
that
doesnt
lose
sight
of
balance
even
with
its
unconventional
hopping
too
hoppy
in
the
aroma
and
a
bit
too
bitterlight
in
body
o
decent
beer
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
definitely
interesting
lil
wheezys
a
pretty
good
beer
as
it
warms
up
the
beer
becomes
more
like
an
amber
as
the
malts
come
out
a
bit
more
this
beers
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
liking
as
an
amber
but
its
still
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
only
my
second
hoppy
lager
if
the
first
two
are
any
indication
this
hookup
just
doesnt
work
it
clashes
like
titans
decent
enough
but
the
two
opposites
just
dont
attract

overall
this
is

all
around
good
balance
and
complexity
of

flavors
with
a
fair
amount
of

and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
the
beer
is
copper
to
orange
in
color
with
a
half
inch
of
white

and
ample

on
the

the

brings

character
shows

supporting

sufficient

especially
in
the
finish
solid
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
an
above
average
hoppy
red
lager
theres
no
doubt
that
this
beer
was
heavily
hopped
and
it
really
comes
out
in
the
flavor
even
a
little
too
much
so
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
wasnt
the
smoothest
and
the
bitterness
really
lingered
the
taste
did
hold
my
attention
but
i
think
one
would
be
enough
for
me
since
i
think
the
bitterness
would
start
to
wear
on
me
after
more
than
one
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
pretty
good
balanced
and
the
highlight
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
it
wasnt
as
smooth
as
i
would
like
and
i
think
if
the
lingering
bitterness
was
cut
down
a
little
it
would
really
help
the
drinkability
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
think
its
a
nice
addition
to
shorts
new
variety
pack
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
really
hoppy
and
really
bitter
bears
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
a
little
more
intense
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
i
still
thought
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
it
just
wasnt
the
most
drinkable
thanks
for
releasing
this
beer
shorts
i
think
it
can
hold
its
own
and
could
be
released
by
its
self
nice
work
guys
this
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
o
decent
brew
but
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
all
of
these
blends
of
hoppy
lagers
it
is
worth
a
shot
but
ill
pass
on
this
the
next
time
around
another
hoppy
lager
from
shorts
and
basically
another
winner
in
my
book
delicate
hands
are
needed
when
combining
lots
of
hops
and
any
types
of
malts
darker
than
pilsner
or
pale
but
shorts
seems
to
know
what
theyre
doing
i
dont
like
this
quite
as
much
as
a
few
of
their
other
hoppy
lagers
but
its
still
a
solid
choice
i
wonder
if
it
will
ever
see
distribution
super
refreshing
beer
great
for
enjoying
outside
by
the
pool
spicy
malty
notes
on
the
nose
smooth
feel
nice
balanced
flavor
good
with
food
love
this
beer
and
this
brewery
pretty
good
brew
not
my
favorite
rahr
sons
but
still
pretty
good
just
average
tastes
mass
produced
not
the
best
finish
but
good
taste
every
time
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
i
like
it
more
its
more
like
rahr
texas
bread
poured
clear
copper
bronze
with
little
head
smelled
of
sweet
bready
malts
and
grains
tastes
bready
and
malty
with
a
nice
finish
of
bitterness
thin
mouthfeel
im
surprised
of
all
the
low
reviews
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
very
clean
going
down
near
refreshing
in
fact
suttle
hops
with
a
crisp
finish
rjt
has
the
right
idea
this
is
a
remarkable
red
for
a
texas
brew
i
am
actually
proud
this
brew
is
from
texadafter
tasting
over
6
fine
red
ales
in
the
pnw
i
am
proud
to
be
a
native
texan
sure
hope
there
is
more
to
come
in
texas
these
guys
are
obviously
learning
and
they
will
soon
master
the
craft
i
found
this
one
to
be
pretty
typical
of
what
i
think
of
when
i
see
something
thats
labeled
red
nicely
colored
quite
reddish
with
a
good
head
and
lace
aroma
and
flavor
are
pretty
malty
with
a
nice
hops
bite
and
a
slightly
lingering
bitterness
from
the
hops
medium
bodied
and
smoothly
carbonated
overall
i
see
no
reason
why
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
red
this
brewery
hasnt
disappointed
me
so
far
othis
beer
had
a
combination
of
grain
yeast
roasted
hops
and
malt
smells
and
taste
that
make
this
a
beer
to
try
again
o
lots
of
taste
and
lots
of
malt
the
full
sweetness
it
promises
never
fully
shows
up
that
huge
malty
nose
isnt
fully
mimicked
in
the
taste
but
its
good
definitely
better
than
average
and
good
enough
that
ill
be
investigating
this
one
further
i
love
malty
english
pale
and
brown
ales
and
honestly
this
has
a
lot
of
those
same
notes
for
a
bit
cheaper
price
who
says
lagers
cant
stand
toetotoe
with
ales
draught
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
reddishamber
color
there
was
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
on
it
it
left
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
isnt
too
bad
pretty
typical
malts
with
some
grassy
notes
a
decent
enough
lager
aroma
the
taste
is
also
good
nothing
really
special
just
good
and
easy
to
drink
malts
some
bitterness
and
biscuit
notes
pretty
smooth
easy
to
drink
malty
toasted
caramel
a
little
sweetness
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
mainly
earthyleafy
a
little
spicy
finish
is
semi
dry
body
is
medium
well
carbonated
smooth
dry
a
little
crisp
summary
nice
i
like
a
lager
every
now
and
then
and
rahrs
is
a
pretty
good
one
its
not
outstanding
but
enjoyable
and
it
goes
nice
with
some
chili
or
maybe
a
burger
good
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
im
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
and
prefer
ales
but
this
has
a
flavor
complexity
and
solid
maltiness
that
may
change
my
mind
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
it
is
nothing
exceptional
and
i
do
not
see
myself
rushing
to
the
store
to
buy
another
six
pack
it
is
a
solid
all
round
lagerthat
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
color
is
really
something
worth
mentioning
i
gave
it
a
4
5
because
it
looks
fantastic
to
me
very
nice
red
lager
color
is
absolutely
perfect
and
out
of
the
bottle
had
a
surprisingly
good
head
on
it
very
creamy
and
malty
beer
id
say
its
very
drinkable
with
slight
hop
notes
but
has
an
over
all
smooth
taste
a
little
caramel
flavor
on
the
back
end
the
beer
pours
an
amber
copper
color
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
smells
of
nutty
malt
dried
fruit
caramel
and
its
a
bit
vegetal
the
taste
is
mostly
bready
malt
flavors
with
some
caramel
toasted
nuts
and
earthy
lemon
hops
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
more
carbonation
than
it
should
have
and
a
very
dry
finish
this
is
an
excellent
amber
red
i
think
i
would
choose
this
over
most
other
ambers
was
in
the
dallas
airport
so
i
bellied
up
to
the
bar
and
ask
the
server
give
your
best
texas
hand
crafted
brew
she
gave
me
this
beer
in
a
pint
glass
and
there
was
no
head
and
had
a
reddish
copper
color
i
would
compare
this
beer
to
a
killigans
had
notes
of
rye
and
malt
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
wish
texas
has
better
beer
o
good
session
beer
to
support
my
local
brewery
with
nothing
special
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
i
tend
to
prefer
limited
and
seasonal
brews
from
rahrs
good
gateway
for
bmc
light
lager
drinkers
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
picked
this
up
from
central
market
in
fort
worth
while
we
were
staying
with
a
friend
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberred
with
a
thin
white
foamy
head
there
was
a
light
aroma
of
semisweet
caramel
but
very
subtle
flavors
are
dark
toasted
malt
initially
with
some
subtle
hopping
at
the
end
smooth
but
watery
especially
on
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
slightly
balanced
with
hops
this
is
an
average
red
and
would
make
a
decent
goto
for
guests
that
may
not
be
fans
of
craft
in
general
to
start
them
on
the
road
of
transition
d
this
beer
is
clean
and
refreshing
and
will
definately
be
having
several
of
these
with
no
problem
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
biscuit
malt
and
a
hint
of
vinegar
taste
up
front
is
major
biscuit
victory
malt
thin
malty
middle
and
an
extremely
tart
finish
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
smooth
however
with
medium
carbonation
levels
drinkability
was
below
average
this
beer
just
wasnt
too
appealing
to
me
imo
they
used
waaay
too
much
victory
malt
and
the
beer
got
more
tart
the
more
i
drank
mouthfeeldrinkability
felt
surprisingly
smooth
even
though
i
felt
it
lacked
in
taste
d
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
unless
it
was
the
only
beer
left
at
the
brewery
came
out
brownish
red
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
aromas
were
of
all
malt
some
caramel
no
hop
aromas
here
the
flavor
was
also
dominated
by
malts
a
little
bit
toasted
malt
and
a
little
bit
caramel
sweet
not
a
bad
flavor
just
sort
of
one
sided
and
somewhat
normal
like
a
killians
but
i
admit
that
it
is
definitely
better
than
killians
i
have
only
had
a
few
other
red
style
lagers
but
i
would
say
this
is
the
best
of
the
bunch
that
i
have
tried
overall
a
great
amber
beer
from
my
local
fort
worth
brewery
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wish
that
my
local
brewery
put
out
a
better
product
drinkability
isnt
bad
i
didnt
care
for
the
smell
at
all
but
the
taste
was
fine
but
not
so
much
that
i
opted
for
a
whole
pint
nevertheless
if
i
was
served
this
at
a
keg
party
or
something
im
probably
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
this
brew
pours
a
dark
shade
of
red
with
some
signs
of
carbonation
a
bit
of
foam
on
top
but
not
much
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
a
hint
of
roasted
grains
and
some
light
hops
the
taste
follows
this
is
definitely
a
malty
amber
brew
hops
are
faint
but
present
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
dominates
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
and
a
great
session
beer
id
recommend
trying
it
drinkability
is
good
as
it
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
good
with
pizza
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
copperreddish
color
forming
a
12
inch
tan
head
that
leaves
light
spots
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
light
consisting
light
malts
and
what
smells
like
grain
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
starting
with
a
hint
of
malts
and
ending
with
a
touch
of
hops
by
no
means
complex
smooth
light
mouthfeel
if
it
werent
for
the
lack
of
flavor
this
could
be
a
very
drinkable
ale
but
no
flavor
equals
bad
beer
overall
this
just
seemed
like
a
light
beer
however
i
could
see
using
this
beer
as
a
starting
point
for
bmc
drinkers
wanting
to
expand
i
really
want
to
like
this
brewery
because
its
in
dfw
but
im
afraid
that
im
done
trying
thier
less
than
stellar
offerings
d
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
the
roastiness
builds
up
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
somewhat
lackluster
very
quaffable
and
a
beer
i
would
drink
watching
football
with
my
friends
so
i
could
pay
attention
d
this
is
a
very
good
lager
from
the
pour
and
description
i
expected
it
to
taste
like
a
vienna
lager
something
like
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
however
this
brew
doesnt
have
the
complex
malt
flavors
of
other
darker
lagers
i
have
tried
that
being
said
i
still
really
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
this
would
be
a
great
choice
to
give
to
the
guy
who
thinks
all
dark
beers
taste
very
strong
and
introduce
him
to
the
wonderful
world
of
craft
beer
i
would
defenitely
buy
it
again

beer
i
would
imagine
rahrs

would
session
great
tried
this
while
visiting
my
folks
in
arlington
a
bit
disappointing
flavor
is
generic
malty
nothing
amazing
little
head
minimal
body
my
impression
was
that
it
reminded
me
of
a
samuel
adams
boston
lager
that
had
been
watered
down
the
other
reviews
of
this
beer
were
rather
more
positive
perhaps
i
just
stumbled
upon
a
bad
batch
a
rather
pedestrian
beer
maybe
a
decent
session
brew
not
really
bad
or
good
id
say
brewed
to
compete
with
shiner
maybe
its
a
little
lighter
dryer
and
crisper
than
shiner
bock
maybe
a
decent
alternative
at
least
it
knows
what
it
is
an
amber
lager
instead
of
calling
itself
a
bock
which
shiner
really
is
not
overall
impression
meh
very
average
amber
lager
drinkable
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
and
would
probably
take
a
shiner
instead
if
given
the
choice
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dates
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
good
head
to
start
the
smell
was
on
the
bland
side
and
malty
without
any
noticeable
hops
i
was
really
hoping
to
like
this
one
since
its
local
and
wanting
to
support
local
efforts
unfortunately
the
taste
followed
the
smell
and
was
pretty
bland
it
had
no
hops
and
was
weak
and
a
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
very
watery
as
well
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
like
so
not
a
style
issue
this
one
is
onpar
with
most
macros
for
me
dont

and
lighter
which
is
fine
as
the
style
isnt
big
in
nature
not
as
much
body
as
other
reds
but
it
is
pretty
good
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
session
away
with
this
one
since
im
in
denton
givin
my
bud
gp
a
visit
i
figured
id
try
some
of
the
local
stock
pours
a
dark
orange
thats
crystal
clear
i
like
it
smell
is
some
grainsyrupy
sweetness
that
surely
does
not
offend
taste
is
in
the
same
line
of
smellin
except
with
some
seltzery
carbonation
to
finish
the
job
this
beer
sits
well
in
the
mouth
and
stomach
and
would
be
very
drinkable
with
even
the
greasiest
of
entrees
a
fair
offering
from
texas
pours
out
to
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
medium
low
carboantion
some
notes
of
lace
aromas
of
caramel
malts
and
grassy
earth
not
bad
taste
was
light
and
slightly
bland
dry
malts
mix
with
medium
bodied
hops
mouthfeel
is
mediocre
with
some
smoothness
about
itself
drinkability
is
north
of
average
this
isnt
great
stuff
but
its
definitly
worthy
of
drinking
special
thanks
goes
out
to
assurbanipaul
for
the
sample
well
this
was
the
loser
of
the
bunch
and
i
by
loser
i
mean
not
as
good
as
the
others
from
rahr
nice
color
amber
quick
disapearing
white
head
smells
of
lager
yeast
and
muncih
malt
sweetness
taste
is
blandish
and
a
little
indifferent
there
is
some
toffee
kind
of
flavors
here
but
not
enough
still
it
is
clean
and
it
would
do
well
for
a
session
whistle
wetting
beer
i
had
no
problems
drinking
this
but
just
not
much
to
it
at
all
its
greatest
value
is
that
it
would
be
very
refreshing
in
the
hot
summer
sun
opinion
well
this
style
of
beer
doesnt
mean
to
be
too
big
so
you
cant
expect
it
to
be
bold
it
does
cross
your
palate
like
a
well
intended
beer
and
not
some
illconceived
macrocrap
like
zeigenbock
or
the
like
i
really
like
the
maltier
beers
but
i
would
actually
have
to
say
in
this
case
that
they
may
want
to
bump
up
the
bittering
just
a
tad
as
it
leaves
the
palate
very
plain
the
sweet
balance
and
attenuation
are
all
good
and
make
it
a
refreshing
yet
sufficiently
flavorful
beer
i
could
definitely
see
buying
a
6pack
of
this
stuff
to
bring
to
a
gettogether
when
i
have
to
drive
myself
home
12
ounce
bottle
sure
this
beer
is
drinkable
it
is
also
forgettable
if
i
could
buy
this
beer
locally
it
might
warrant
a
once
a
year
purchase
of
the
three
beers
ive
tried
from
rahrs
this
is
by
far
the
least
impressive
maybe
this
beer
is
just
good
and
the
other
two
were
just
that
special
whatever
the
case
i
am
happy
i
tried
it
thanks
assurbanipaul
the
color
is
a
pale
shade
of
amber
with
a
tall
thick
head
the
aroma
is
of
mild
malt
strength
with
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
isnt
as
fullflavored
as
expected
this
seems
a
little
watery
the
smooth
malt
body
is
enhanced
by
a
caramel
flavor
mixed
with
a
mild
smokiness
a
touch
of
herbal
german
hop
flavor
rounds
this
beer
out
drinkability
is
good
but
for
flavor
there
are
better
amber
lager
choices
out
there
it
does
cause
a
bit
of
friction
on
the
palate
if
too
cold
the
roasted
sweet
flavors
come
out
as
the
brew
warms
up
and
thats
how
i
would
recommend
it
higher
than
what
is
currently
shown
on
ba
this
is
a
perfectly
serviceable
beer
more
interesting
than
a
macro
and
easy
to
enjoy
without
thinking
too
much
about
it
this
would
go
nicely
with
barbecue
methinks
well
you
know
im
pretty
surprised
that
this
scores
higher
than
well
the
red
tail
ale
that
i
just
had
i
mean
well
yeah
i
liked
the
red
tail
better
so
thats
not
much
for
constructive
criticism
is
it
well
its
very
light
on
the
body
hmm
looking
at
the
different
weights
on
the
different
parts
i
guess
i
see
the
problem
too
much
weight
on
the
appearance
well
this
one
sure
looks
nice
a
deep
amber
with
a
smallish
white
head
yes
the
head
is
quickly
gone
but
the
lacing
lasts
the
taste
isnt
well
bad
or
anything
its
just
so
light
and
airy
theres
not
much
there
to
taste
no
hops
very
light
malts
thin
i
guess
thats
much
my
experience
with
this
one
thin
not
bad
or
anything
but
i
cant
really
see
myself
going
out
and
buying
this
to
have
this
you
know
while
this
beer
pours
a
beatiful
clear
pale
amberorange
color
with
a
soft
and
thick
cream
colored
head
the
smell
is
quite
subtle
whats
there
smell
pretty
nice
but
quite
muted
the
aroma
consists
of
a
soft
grain
with
a
slight
hop
presence
the
taste
is
a
smooth
grainy
taste
with
fresh
cut
grass
notes
and
a
small
jagged
edge
of
hop
bitterness
combined
with
the
carbonation
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
beer
that
finishes
slightly
dry
and
roasty
despite
the
somewhat
smooth
characteristic
of
this
beer
drinkability
isnt
quite
what
i
expected
still
a
solid
beer
but
perhaps
not
my
favorite
style
nonetheless
i
hope
rahr
does
very
well
thanks
to
aunt
beckie
for
bringing
me
this
beer
cheers
i
must
say
that
i
do
love
the
rahr
bottle
labelsespecially
this
one
with
the
crimson
background
and
black
silhouette
of
a
longhorn
head
it
sort
of
has
a
beast
from
hell
look
to
it
as
for
the
beer
it
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
thick
and
frothy
white
head
that
very
slowly
recedes
into
a
fluffy
lacevery
nice
the
nose
possesses
some
light
floral
notes
but
overall
is
a
bit
subdued
the
taste
begins
with
lightly
caramel
malts
and
a
mild
fruitiness
followed
by
notes
of
black
tea
and
a
mildly
spicy
hop
bitterness
towards
the
finish
smooth
and
easydrinkinga
great
session
beer
drinkabilitynotes
smooth
and
very
flavorful
an
easy
to
drink
session
beer
overall
impression
a
bit
harsh
overall
for
a
red
with
the
malts
seemingly
a
bit
over
roasted
or
perhaps
oversparged
a
bit
astringent
i
had
no
trouble
drinking
this
and
ill
pick
some
more
up
next
time
i
see
it
my
first
sample
from
the
tap
seemed
a
bit
more
mellow
and
tasty
one
finger
of
pale
tan
dense
foamy
slow
head
nice
again
the
beer
is
slightly
hazy
and
a
dark
redbrown
sheets
and
swoops
of
lacing
sugar
in
the
nose
nuts
a
little
soap
malty
nutty
sweet
and
fruity
up
front
the
middle
shows
thick
malt
and
fruit
dark
caramel
tangy
fruity
and
really
very
bitter
at
the
end
its
good
quite
fruity
and
nutty
with
solid
caramel
moreso
with
temperature
this
is
really
much
better
warm
lets
see
what
this
brings
us
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clean
clear
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
slight
caramel
and
lotso
f
other
business
that
i
dont
like
i
would
guess
its
is
hop
that
doesnt
giveo
ff
the
good
smell
but
there
is
definately
something
the
flavor
is
just
okay
the
hop
is
not
as
offensive
but
it
just
tastes
dirty
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
there
is
some
caramel
sweetness
in
there
but
the
hop
hides
it
the
feel
is
rather
thin
and
bubbly
i
would
like
at
least
a
medium
body
this
is
definately
not
my
favorite
beer
the
nose
and
flavor
are
just
not
nice
and
the
feel
is
lacking
12oz
brown
glass
bottle
thanks
to
assurbanipaul
for
the
sample
pours
a
very
nice
scarlet
red
color
that
is
a
nice
bright
color
when
held
to
light
smell
is
faintly
grassy
somewhat
carmely
and
slightly
nutty
big
malt
flavors
dominate
this
beer
making
a
nice
balance
between
roasted
malt
and
grassy
flavors
mouthfeel
is
full
and
robust
and
drinkability
is
also
very
pleasing
very
strong
effort
here
it
stands
out
against
most
lagers
i
can
think
of
from
american
micros
this
is
a
fine
fine
beer
particularly
for
the
first
one
out
of
the
box
it
is
evident
that
fritz
and
his
staff
have
taken
great
pains
to
get
it
right
the
first
time
i
look
forward
to
trying
his
other
offerings
at
the
brewery
and
in
the
bottle
this
could
be
a
better
beer
and
i
hope
one
day
it
is
medium
body
but
balanced
and
does
not
grow
tiring
a
very
good
session
beer
it
definitely
grows
on
you
after
a
while
