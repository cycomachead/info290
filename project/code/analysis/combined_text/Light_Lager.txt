id
like
to
try
a
bottle
now
just
for
comparo
when
i
realized
i
was
willing
to
drive
all
over
the
place
to
find
it
i
understood
finally
that
this
is
my
favorite
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
beer
that
has
a
fullbody
feel
and
taste
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
all
other
light
beers
end
up
tasting
like
water
with
some
beer
in
it
by
comparison
with
that
said
compared
to
miller
lite
youll
be
having
an
extra
approx
thirty
calories
but
considering
the
trade
off
it
is
well
worth
it
this
is
easily

i
have
drank
this
beer
since
my
college
days
of
the
late
1990s
i
still
drink
and
enjoy
it
today
can
only
find
it
sold
at
certain
stores
in
certain
geographical
locations
dissappointed
when
i
can
not
find
it
in
a
store
which
happens
more
often
than
not
shatters
my
expectations
i
guess
pretty
drinkable
and
there
are
not
terribly
disgusting
off
flavors
though
it
does
come
off
a
little
too
metallic
for
me
to
recommend
it
as
a
good

no

sweet

with

tasting
yields
a
burst
of
sweet
flavors
for
a

its
not
bad
but
then
again
just
get
high
life
full
worse
than
the
original
champagne
of
beers
this
an
above
average
light
american
beer
for
taste
it
may
be
the
best
tasting
macrobrew
light
american
lager
because
the
beer
taste
is
there
miller
and
bud
light
have
almost
no
taste
coors
is
sweet
but
not
a
lot
of
beer
taste
i
think
miller
high
lifw
light
is
a
quality
beer
and
maybe
best
in
its
category
lets
be
honest
its
highlife
tastes
awful
serve
cold
so
you
cant
taste
crisp
refreshing
beer
for
a
nice
evening
at
home
or
out
with
friends
tasters
like
a
cross
between
miller
high
life
and
michelob
ultra
mildly
flavorful
and
yet
superbly
smooth
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
this
is
hard
to
beat
a
real
thirst
quencher
overall
for
a
light
beer
this
one
isnt
half
bad
i
still
stand
by
high
life
as
being
the
better
option
but
if
youre
watching
your
waistline
this
one
aint
bad
just
make
sure
you
dont
reach
for
two
for
every
one
of
regular
high
life
youd
grab
normally
because
the
flavor
is
missing
defeats
the
purpose
only
time
i
will
drink
this
is
if
im
rolling
through
atlanta
and
see
a
40oz
at
the
gas
station
of
it
other
then
that
i
wouldnt
give
this
to
my
horses
at
room
temperature
ill
pass
but
throw
one
in
the
freezer
for
awhile
and
you
will
take
out
a
decent
tasting
beer
for
those
weeks
when
moneys
tight
founders
it
aint
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
budmilloors
products
o
considering
that
i
dont
like
light
beers
this
one
has
enough
character
to
alert
me
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
beer
very
smooth
and
drinkable
refreshing
even
miller
wins
again
grab
a
30
pack
cans
put
your
snooty
nose
away
and
enjoy
a
few
beers
your
dad
had
and
wonder
why
this
has
not
been
in
your
rotation
before
overall
hey
everyone
has
their
opinions
but
for
my
budget
being
what
it
is
and
my
propensity
to
gain
weight
if
im
not
careful
among
regular
beers
without
worries
to
price
or

overall
cheap
beer
with
no
taste
only
redeeming
quality
is
if
you
drink
enough
of
it
you
forgot
how
bad
it
is
this
beer
is
great
for
the
beginner
drinker
it
is
a
very
light
and
not
too
harsh
of
flavors
for
a
beer
i
recommend
pouring
this
beer
into
a
class
to
release
some
of
the
carbonation
it
gives
it
better
flavor
and
allows
you
to
drink
more
this
beer
has
been
around
for
a
while
allowing
it
to
be
one
of
the
classic
beers
and
a
perfect
transition
to
the
new
beer
drinker
the
first
time
i
saw
this
beer
it
was
on
tap
at
a
bar
and
it
was
a
light
yellowgold
coloring
to
it
i
was
not
a
big
fan
of
the
smell
because
it
smelled
a
little
malty
and
almost
like
it
had
gone
bad
the
taste
was
decent
though
but
maybe
a
little
watered
down
because
it
was
light
well
welcome
to
another
college
beer
with
no
taste
smell
and
overall
flat
mouthfeel
great
beer
for
college
kids
looking
for
7
deal
for
a
12
pack
utterly
disgusted
to
call
this
a
beer
being
a
dipa
lover
this
is
not
my
style
this
beer
is
good
for
someone
who
needs
a
cheap
beer
fast
and
make
sure
to
get
tums
for
the
morning
this
guy
does
not
sit
well
give
it
a
shot
if
you
gotta
go
light
overall
well
what
can
you
say
nothing
special
or
all
that
flavorful
if
it
wasnt
for
the
off
flavors
at
the
end
of
the
taste
it
would
have
been
much
easier
drinking
and
sessionable
o
overall
its
a
light
beer
that
actually
has
some
flavor
better
than
any
light
beer
ive
ever
had
the
champagne
of
beers
should
not
be
done
in
a
light
version
over
all
not
terrible
for
a
light
beer
i
think
it
fits
the
style
but
it
could
have
a
little
more
flavor
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
not
too
bad
at
all
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
better
bud
light
taste
wise
light
beers
with
a
decent
flavour
have
their
time
and
place
this
beer
would
work
well
for
camping
trips
etc
o
ok
for
quaffing
just
a
super
plain
lager
with
no
standout
flavors
if
you
havent
tried
it
and
are
looking
for
an
everyday
beer
pick
up
a
six
and
try
it
having
a
goodsized
party
it
and
miller
high
life
for
your
lightbeeradverse
guests
are
great
choices
and
few
people
if
any
are
going
to
turn
them
down
i
cant
sum
this
up
better
than
my
friend
did
they
took
a
light
inoffensive
beer
and
somehow
made
it
even
lighter
at
the
same
price
as
regular
theres
no
reason
to
buy
this
overall
a
nice
light
and
refreshing
beer
to
go
with
anything
not
what
you
want
to
warm
up
to
on
a
cold
winter
night
but
good
with
picnic
food
and
crabs
the
carbonation
takes
away
from
the
overall
drinkability
honestly
this
wasnt
offensive
in
any
way
but
it
lacked
substance
in
every
way
18
beers
for
under
9
bucks
its
hard
to
pass
up
ill
hand
these
out
to
visitors
who
may
not
appreciate
craft
beer
ill
even
have
a
few
myself
to
curb
my
spending
on
better
beer
high
life
light
is
not
as
good
as
straight
high
life
it
is
a
typical
light
lager
american
style
beer
the
color
is
yellowgold
clear
with
big
carbonation
and
head
to
start
and
then
fades
to
nothing
the
smell
and
taste
are
common
to
theis
style
grainbarleywheat
and
some
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
what
it
is
beer
that
has
a
lighter
abv
and
taste
overall
its
great
for
hot
days
overall
for
an
adjunct
it
really
was
not
that
terrible
but
who
are
we
kidding
it
is
still
an
adjunct
i
would
never
have
it
again
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
twist
on
an
old
school
beer
and
it
tastes
well
old
school
i
often
drink
lite
beers
when
not
enjoying
craft
brews
but
i
would
certinaly
choose
plainold
miller
lite
above
this
blend
a
little
too
much
skunky
taste
to
be
the
champagne
of
beers
for
me
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
sixpack
o
i
can
personally
attest
to
the
drinkability
of
this
one
friends
and
i
used
to
put
it
down
by
the
case
for
1
while
playing
darts
downtown
a
few
years
back
shameful
but
its
got
its
place
i
suppose
the
question
is
though
with
110
calories
in
this
light
beer
why
even
drink
it
overall
im
pretty
impressed
taste
is
better
than
expected
for
a
light
adjunct
beer
this
might
be
the
best
light
beer
ive
had
high
life
original
is
my
go
to
macro
beer
why
this
travesty
exists
is
beyond
me
pours
a
watery
yellow
with
minimal
head
and
not
much
character
smells
of
pure
grain
and
astringency
flavor
is
really
non
existent
with
an
off
putting
malt
flavor
and
skunkiness
making
up
the
majority
of
the
profile
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
the
carbonation
makes
it
seem
even
thinner
my
least
favorite
of
all
light
beers
d
not
for
me
i
love
my
wifes
relatives
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
and
review
these
gems
o
one
of
the
better
cheap
light
beers
out
there
miller
high
life
light
has
an
incredibly
thick
white
head
and
a
clear
straw
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
surprisingly
high
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
breadier
than
other
light
beers
but
the
taste
is
as
dull
and
watery
as
the
rest
yet
without
that
unpleasant
mineral
water
aspect
a
decent
hop
bitterness
shows
up
mainly
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
and
miller
high
life
light
finishes
crisp
refreshing
and
dry
overall
this
is
a
little
better
than
the
average
light
beer
rjt
overall
for
the
price
you
cant
beat
it
as
a
beer
its
horrible
as
a
light
lager
its
about
average
which
isnt
really
a
good
thing
so
i
guess
that
proves
that
there
is
a
place
in
the
world
for
light
beers
i
did
try
to
find
out
how
much
of
the
stuff
miller
brews
no
luck
but
it
is
probably
on
par
with
all
of
the
beer
brewed
in
belgium
lol
at
all
the
pompous
beer
snobs
on
here
crying
and
giving
this
an
f
what
did
you
think
this
beer
was
going
to
be
it
is
a
cheap
light
beer
for
when
you
feel
like
getting
mashed
go
back
to
jacking
off
over
your
overpriced
and
over
rated
belgians
nerds
d
good
representation
of
a
popular
style
the
carbonation
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
body
and
abv
make
this
a
chugger
taste
not
much
there
carbonation
water
and
aluminum
have
to
wonder
what
this
tastes
like
out
of
the
can
hops
nonexistant
any
flavor
notes
are
all
a
turn
off
even
regular
high
life
seems
miles
superior
to
this
the
only
saving
grace
is
that
the
actual
flavor
is
so
minimal
the
negative
aspects
are
at
least
diluted
with
lots
of
water
after
trying
one
of
these
with
some
friends
i
made
the
joke
that
this
should
be
called
miller
low
life
because
there
is
nothing
about
this
brew
there
is
virtually
no
flavor
at
all
its
almost
clear
in
color
with
a
slight
tinge
of
yellow
mouthfeel
is
far
too
light
this
really
shouldnt
be
a
beer
its
sad
that
people
enjoy
these
a
worthy
changeup
brew
for
the
lightbeerinclined
the
folks
that
refuse
to
step
away
from
the
american
adjunct
lager
style
pours
with
about
one
finger
of
head
which
didnt
stick
around
for
long
it
took
longer
than
i
expected
to
dissolve
though
the
odor
is
your
average
ambiguously
sweet
faint
light
beer
aroma
the
flavor
is
not
very
sweet
at
all
its
starchy
and
dry
high
life
light
is
thin
and
heavily
carbonated
it
wont
impress
anybody
but
its
a
good
fit
when
you
want
one
after
another
after
another
on
a
hot
day
d
this
is
a
pretty
innocuous
light
lager
it
tastes
okay
and
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
other
than
a
lack
of
real
substantial
flavors
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
want
an
inexpensive
very
drinkable
light
beer

a

had

water
that
had

going

than
this
insipid
brew
its
filtered
and
pasteurized
beyond
recognition
as

i
only
drink
good
beer
and
that
does
not
include
this
brew
a
good
working
in
the
yard
on
the
car
cutting
grass
or
hanging
by
the
pool
beer
screw
off
cap
and
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
clear
yellow
appearance
lighter
in
color
than
the
high
life
original
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
and
light
body
very
drinkable
when
you
want
a
thirst
quenching
lawnmower
beer
me
i
enjoy
this
at
my
desk
after
a
hard
day
at
work
no
off
flavors
noticeable
at
5
99
a
twelve
pack
in
glass
bottles
its
a
steal
this
taste
has
some
corn
a
bit
of
skunk
and
also
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
light
bodied
thin
and
watery
and
too
much
carbonation
this
is
just
nasty
thankfully
i
did
not
have
to
pay
for
this
it
was
offered
to
me
at
a
get
together
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
here
i
like
the
champagne
of
beers
but
its
lighter
counterpart
is
lacking
its
still
better
than
bud
or
miller
light
though
drinks
good
as
long
as
its
cold
its
pretty
watery
really
its
not
bad
i
was
pretty
surprised
poured
from
a
clear
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
notes
of
corn
taste
is
also
very
mild
some
hints
of
malts
and
corn
not
much
going
on
here
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
my
favorite
cheap
beer
light
but
with
a
slight
complexity
of
flavor
drinkability
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
due
to
their
lightness
in
texturefilling
although
not
a
complex
beer
at
all
overall
i
will
have
to
give
it
a
pass
not
worth
the
time
on
this
one
things
can
get
too
light
people
d
a
little
tasty
even
though
its
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
quite
easily
since
there
isnt
much
to
it
and
likewise
its
not
filling
at
all
very
mild
kick
long
ago
this
was
my
inexpensive
goto
beer
and
i
still
think
its
one
of
the
better
fizzy
yellow
beers
out
there
d
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
all
the
flavor
seemed
to
disappear
leaving
a
watery
beer
not
a
good
way
to
finish
i
really
dont
enjoy
this
beer
but
it
can
be
a
necessary
evil
while
in
a
social
atmosphere
its
a
nice
beer
if
youre
at
a
friends
party
or
out
at
a
local
bar
with
the
guys
however
it
is
by
no
means
a
sipping
beer
i
like
it
better
than
bud
light
needless
to
say
its
one
of
the
better
macro
beers
out
there
while
its
not
especially
good
i
would
pick
this
over
almost
any
light
adjunct
it
is
a
light
lager
after
all
really
though
its
better
than
any
bmc
light
i
can
think
of
d
cmon
its
cheap
middle
of
the
road
taste
and
made
for
mass
and
rapid
consumption
i
would
buy
again
when
the
shakes
strike
cant
explain
this
atrocity
just
god
awful
and
had
to
pour
it
out
it
had
the
taste
of
heartburn
going
down
and
littered
my
throat
with
the
feeling
you
get
after
drinking
a
lemony
drink
like
you
have
to
spit
or
at
worst
throw
up
got
some
from
a
relative
and
tried
to
force
three
down
couldnt
do
it
and
poured
the
last
one
down
the
drain
funny
thing
is
i
have
one
more
in
the
second
fridge
and
no
one
who
comes
over
will
drink
it
what
this
lacks
in
depth
flavor
and
character
it
makes
up
for
in
poundability
this
is
the
one
single
beer
that
lacks
anything
except
the
poundability
to
keep
up
with
the
joneses
that
is
if
jones
is
a
total
alky
and
nothing
but
sits
in
his
garage
door
open
and
drinks
beer
all
day
overall
ultimately
this
stuff
is
an
upgrade
over
keystone
and
natty
and
fits
into
the
category
of
busch
light
drinkability
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
chug
this
is
a
nice
way
to
go
but
if
you
are
like
me
and
like
to
enjoy
your
brews
then
dump
it
out
this
is
the
only
cheap
light
beer
worth
drinking
50
a
can
this
is
a
bargain
and
i
like
finding
good
bargains
a
very
nicely
done
cheap
light
beer
picked
up
a
12
pack
for
5
99
that
was
slightly
past
expiration
great
price
refreshing
light
beer
that
goes
down
easy
it
even
has
more
delicious
alcohol
than
most
light
beers
its
mostly
tasteless
but
not
offensive
like
bud
light
tastes
mostly
of
corn
with
a
bit
of
hops
and
maits
its
only
cheap
light
beer
but
i
like
it
my
pour
produced
a
rocky
fluffy
two
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
heavily
of
cereal
adjuncts
oof
mouthfeel
was
thin
sort
of
watery
with
a
light
lager
sweetness
accompanied
by
the
alltoofamiliar
taste
of
cereal
on
the
tongue
finish
was
mild
almost
flavorless
i
cannot
get
behind
this
one
drinkability
this
was
refreshing
and
one
of
the
better
light
beers
that
ive
had
d
i
drink
this
once
a
blue
moon
when
im
strapped
for
cash
and
calorie
counts
see
this
beer
gets
low
ratings
but
its
other
light
counterparts
are
equally
as
poor
on
the
taste
scale
why
pay
more
id
pick
this
over
coors
light
or
miller
light
any
day
d
i
drank
a
few
and
this
isnt
a
truly
awful
brew
certainly
better
than
bud
light
and
miller
lite
d
for
a
macro
light
lager
not
bad
cheers
d
i
guess
as
far
as
light
macro
beer
goes
this
isnt
the
worst
probably
wouldnt
be
terrible
at
a
cookout
if
nothing
else
was
available
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
mar0810bo1200329
sampled
on
december
17
2009
frankly
i
cannot
distinguish
and
difference
between
this
one
miller
lite
or
miller
genuine
draft
light
64
the
pour
is
your
typical
pale
yellow
with
buibbly
carbonation
and
thin
white
head
that
sticks
around
longer
than
expected
the
aroma
is
mildly
malty
but
mainly
corny
and
grassy
thin
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
fresh
enough
for
its
style
with
a
vague
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
but
generally
it
is
a
typical
mass
produced
pale
but
it
is
a
good
way
to
save
money
while
keeping
the
calories
down
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
a
bubbly
finish
tastes
better
than
some
other
domestic
brands
on
the
market
especially
for
a
light
beer
it
is
what
it
is
and
thats
a
light
beer
probably
the
best
for
the
money
miller
got
it
right
for
this
one
its
got
a
sweet
taste
with
the
perfect
amount
carbonation
very
refreshing
even
when
at
room
temperature
but
much
better
cold
obviously
decent
light
lager
though
the
style
itself
lacks
character
for
the
light
lager
drinker
who
actually
wants
a
flavor
besides
water
if
there
are
any
of
those
im
a
closet
fan
of
its
big
brother
mostly
due
to
nostalgia
and
choose
it
when
pickings
are
slim
or
massive
consumption
is
crucial
the
light
version
lacks
any
hint
of
charm
if
forced
to
drink
a
light
beer
this
wouldnt
be
it
i
am
usually
a
bit
hesitant
towards
light
lite
beer
but
so
far
in
my
adventure
in
the
world
of
beer
i
find
this
to
be
a
good
example
of
light
beer
yes
i
gave
it
high
marks
but
thats
because
this
beer
is
what
its
supposed
to
be
and
then
some
it
destroys
bud
lite
coors
light
and
miller
lite
you
cannot
beat
this
as
far
as
a
cheap
pound
em
down
refreshing
beer
drink
one
after
cutting
the
grass
and
youll
see
what
i
mean
taste
is
a
watery
beer
great
cold
smell
is
the
usual
from
these
kinds
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
great
awesome
beer
for
what
it
is
a
super
cheap
super
drinkable
average
joe
beer
and
i
hate
this
style
so
that
should
tell
you
something
taste
is
clean
and
definitely
corn
oriented
highly
carbonated
and
a
touch
sweet
it
is
not
completely
devoid
of
flavor
and
i
would
even
venture
so
far
as
to
say
it
has
more
than
the
average
light
lager
i
would
rather
have
a
mhl
regular
but
this
is
a
finishable
16oz
sample
smuggled
home
from
softball
this
was
a
decent
light
beer
a
little
flavor
but
mostly
an
alternative
to
drinking
water
after
playing
sports
dont
buy
it
compared
to
any
other
light
besides
corona
it
tastes
terrible
just
roll
with
the
high
life
regular
which
is
tasty
for
the
price
pours
a
light
yellow
straw
color
the
aroma
is
virtually
missing
it
smells
slightly
of
alcohol
and
maybe
some
corn
the
overall
taste
is
bland
nothing
on
any
note
to
it
it
is
watery
and
there
is
a
hint
of
grains
but
it
is
so
small
it
isnt
worth
mentioning
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
carbonated
overall
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
them
but
you
wouldnt
very
simplistic
as
beers
go
this
beer
in
very
bland
and
boring
however
as
really
cheap
light
beers
go
this
is
great
one
of
the
best
of
the
really
cheap
beers
i
definitely
recommend
drinking
all
miller
products
from
a
can
or
tap
the
clear
glass
bottles
look
great
but
being
hidden
from
the
light
makes
this
beer
a
fraction
better
d
good
cheap
session
beer
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
while
grilling
on
a
summer
night
or
just
after
having
mowed
the
lawn
d
i
can
drink
alot
of
these
with
no
problem
i
have
a
true
soft
spot
for
miller
being
my
stepdads
brew
of
choice
and
its
uaw
made
which
means
somethign
coming
from
a
union
family
mhll
is
not
a
bad
light
beerweak
flavor
although
certainly
stronger
than
mgd
64
with
a
slight
pissy
bitterness
as
an
aftertaste
simple
drinkable
and
refreshing
nothing
to
challenge
the
palate
but
nothing
to
overwhelm
it
either
the
beer
equivalent
of
a
reading
john
grishamnot
an
unpleasant
way
to
spend
time
but
not
exactly
reading
ulysses
either
not
bad
for
the
style
its
not
going
to
knock
your
fucking
socks
off
but
if
youre
at
a
party
and
you
dont
give
a
shit
what
you
drink
grab
a
bottle
of
this
if
its
available
unfortunately
this
is
not
one
that
i
enjoyed
the
tiny
smidgen
of
smell
and
taste
present
are
not
very
pleasant
this
beer
borders
on
foul
but
the
word
that
consistently
comes
to
mind
is
shallow
not
quite
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
but
pretty
damn
close
a
good
example
of
a
light
lager
flavor
is
crisp
and
unified
very
typical
light
lager
i
can
drink
but
would
only
do
so
when
my
options
are
limited
now
i
love
the
high
life
that
being
said
high
life
light
is
a
true
step
down
from
the
champagne
of
beers
it
has
not
the
flavor
nor
the
rich
color
of
high
life
and
has
a
different
odd
aroma
for
some
reason
this
beer
doesnt
even
feel
that
great
in
your
mouth
oh
well
the
high
life
is
the
same
price
well
a
free
beer
cant
be
a
bad
beer
can
it
looks
like
a
golden
yellow
color
egg
white
head
with
constant
carbonation
rising
up
the
glass
smells
like
a
macro
corny
and
nasty
tastes
like
corn
slightly
bitter
but
crisp
the
lightness
bugs
the
hell
out
of
me
but
its
high
life
what
do
i
expect
not
that
great
thank
god
i
didnt
pay
money
for
it
but
disgusting
nonetheless
the
beer
appears
a
very
light
or
pale
clear
yellow
with
a
very
light
white
head
that
dissipated
rapidly
no
aroma
of
note
the
beer
had
a
metallic
taste
to
it
which
was
strange
for
a
bottle
very
light
grain
taste
and
water
the
beer
was
over
carbonated
and
had
a
very
light
body
to
it
considering
that
i
buy
the
high
life
from
time
to
time
i
figured
that
i
might
like
this
as
well
but
i
was
wrong
it
appeared
completely
different
from
the
high
life
i
will
be
avoiding
this
one
from
now
on
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
while
it
is
not
the
best
tasting
when
comparing
it
to
other
similarly
priced
beers
it
excels
bang
for
buck
this
is
my
light
beer
of
choice
especially
if
you
are
in
college
and
tired
of
natty
or
milwaukees
best
or
keystone
this
is
your
saving
grace
very
pale
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lace
almost
nonexistant
aroma
bitter
and
slightly
hoppy
basically
water
however
a
little
maltiness
is
detectable
on
the
tongue
very
light
and
smooth
not
horrible
for
light
macro
nothing
too
offensive
pale
yellow
with
a
white
cap
of
foam
it
actually
looks
elegant
in
a
goldrimmed
flute
the
smell
is
only
of
grains
and
sugar
while
i
thought
that
this
had
a
better
taste
and
mouthfeel
than
miller
high
life
it
was
still
pretty
poor
unspectacular
swill
with
no
redeeming
values
drinkability
the
best
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
the
light
body
and
watery
taste
makes
going
through
high
life
far
too
easy
at
15
for
a
30
pack
it
is
not
bad
on
the
wallet
either
the
champagne
of
beers
little
brother
from
the
can
very
pale
fizzy
high
level
of
carbonation
light
corn
smell
the
taste
is
simple
fizzy
seltzer
a
touch
of
corn
clean
and
dry
finish
lacking
in
offflavors
super
chuggable
and
refreshing
a
reasonable
approximation
of
high
life
heavy
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
light
beers
sampled
a
couple
out
of
the
keg
at
an
ox
roast
tonight
i
like
a
cold
high
life
once
in
a
while
and
the
lite
version
is
not
too
far
off
and
better
than
most
other
commercial
light
beers
not
too
much
to
get
excited
about
but
the
couple
that
i
had
hit
the
spot
faint
aroma
light
appearance
with
a
good
sizable
head
somewhat
full
mouthfeel
solid
flavor
this
beer
other
than
a
somewhat
unpleasant
aroma
is
exactly
what
its
supposed
to
be
whether
you
like
the
style
or
not
i
actually
think
its
better
than
some
other
light
lagers
but
not
the
best
for
a
light
brew
this
is
a
solid
choice
it
may
be
living
the
lighter
side
of
the
high
life
but
at
least
its
the
high
life
light
and
fizzy
as
expected
go
figure
a
bit
slickish
but
pretty
clean
as
long
as
its
cold
its
easy
enough
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
if
you
want
tasteless
beer
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
fizzy
but
not
overly
i
think
that
high
life
is
one
of
the
better
macros
if
not
the
best
but
this
is
just
a
waste
of
time
meant
for
those
who
look
at
carbs
and
dont
want
flavor
just
easy
drinking
well
i
bought
a
30
pack
at
the
asking
of
some
guys
helping
to
build
my
deck
i
must
say
drinking
this
beer
is
like
drinking
straight
soda
water
with
a
mild
taste
that
i
could
almost
swear
was
beer
the
alcohol
was
welcome
the
ligthness
was
good
for
pouring
concrete
and
carefully
deconstructing
the
siding
definately
lawn
mower
beer
not
something
to
drink
to
enjoy
beer
but
next
time
ill
stick
to
my
lemonade
and
bourbon
ah
yes
im
really
living
the
high
life
now
a
light
lager
in
one
hand
and
a
garden
hose
in
the
other
this
is
an
extra
clear
yellow
with
not
much
of
a
white
head
not
much
of
a
nose
either
possibly
some
corn
water
the
flavor
profile
is
flat
with
again
corn
and
some
grains
a
watery
and
fizzy
body
make
me
want
to
feed
this
to
the
flowers
i
wont
though
in
fear
they
might
die
chug
chug
chug
d
there
is
no
aftertaste
on
this
beer
so
it
helps
you
forget
about
the
slight
sweetness
that
so
many
bas
find
off
putting
so
it
is
drinkable
certainly
does
not
drink
good
but
drinks
easily
so
ive
giving
it
an
average
rating
in
this
department
pale
yellow
color
12
in
white
head
that
left
good
legs
on
the
pint
glass
very
foamy
even
with
a
slow
pour
this
beer
has
a
faint
bitter
smell
leaning
heavily
on
hops
there
also
was
a
slight
metallic
smell
the
beer
was
bland
at
best
not
much
flavor
mild
hops
earthy
taste
at
best
not
much
to
it
was
left
from
a
grill
out
so
thought
i
would
review
almost
invisible
gold
if
such
a
color
existed
ran
out
of
good
beer
and
needed
one
more
to
watch
the
postgame
of
the
super
bowl
if
you
are
ever
in
a
pinch
and
need
that
one
last
beer
to
get
you
through
the
night
and
dont
care
then
this
still
shouldnt
be
it
aside
from
no
smell
there
is
a
sharp
adjunct
tast
and
it
is
not
smooth
like
most
crappy
macros
at
least
in
fact
this
dried
out
my
tongue
on
the
backbite
felt
like
a
burn
the
first
time
this
could
end
up
being
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
although
that
distinction
is
held
for
a
certain
light
beer
w
incessant
advertising
and
a
malt
liquor
that
made
me
sick
i
wasnt
paying
attention
to
what
i
was
doing
and
grabbed
a
case
of
these
instead
of
regular
high
lifes
boy
was
i
sorry
not
a
great
tasting
beer
at
all
i
hate
to
describe
a
beer
as
skunky
or
as
piss
but
these
fit
the
bill
i
just
couldnt
get
over
the
first
initial
taste
and
things
just
got
worse
from
there
id
avoid
these
like
a
screaming
case
of
herpes
each
macro
does
have
a
beer
i
can
drink
and
if
its
the
only
thing
available
i
can
enjoy
i
was
at
a
bar
that
only
had
macros
and
thought
i
was
getting
a
miller
high
life
this
beer
had
an
off
color
tasted
like
creamed
corn
soda
or
something
and
had
a
watery
fizzy
unpleasant
mouthfeel
this
is
one
i
flat
out
could
not
drink
high
life
itself
is
pretty
light
no
need
to
go
lighter

not
as
horrible
as
i
was
anticipating
being
a
big
fan
of
regular
miller
lite
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
similar
to
miller
lite
but
to
an
ardent
drinker
of
the
brew
there
were
some
noticeable
differences
that
were
apparent
enough
for
me
to
not
be
too
crazy
about
this
one
appearance
and
smell
were
very
typical
for
a
light
lager
and
the
taste
was
about
average
but
i
prefer
many
other
lite
samples
compared
to
this
one
another
brew
which
forced
me
to
take
a
tums
after
downing
a
couple
goes
down
pretty
easily
and
smooth
but
wouldnt
cop
another

not

refreshing
when
very

not
my
beer
of
choice
nor
one
i
would
foist
on
friends
this
is
corona
at
half
the
price
not
much
else
to
say
about
the
beer
as
you
know
what
to
expect
nothing
really
stands
out
it
is
definately
a
light
beer
with
heavy
carbonation
if
you
were
to
swill
a
beer
this
would
be
a
good
candidate
at
its
price
point
in
fact
this
is
my
swill
beer
of
choice
just
dont
pour
it
into
a

d
i
dont

how
people
drink
this
i
have
this

from

if

the

is
a

alternative
when
the

is
out
of

but
id
stick
to
the
real
thing
when
buying
the
schwagg
could
drink
several
of
these
wow
this
is
not
a
good
beer
but
if
you
just
want
to
drink
and
not
spend
a
lot
of
money
this
beer
is
for
you
at
6
dollars
for
a
12
pack
of
bottles
its
does
the
job
its
intended
to
do
its
also
pretty
good
for
quenching
thirst
after
mowing
the
grass
or
working
in
the
garage
being
a
fan
of
high

this
must
once
and
for
all
prove
that
there
is
no
good
light
beer
not
anywhere
similiar

only
watered
down

mainly
bring
the
alcohol
to
the
forefront
especially
compared
to

this
is
just
a
watered
down
version
of
high

where
the
negatives
get
much
worse
and
fast
skunks
easy
has
to
be
cold
and
you
have
to
be
thirsty
actually
has
some
detectable
hops
doesnt
help
its
detestable
taste
stick
with

its
in

grabbed

to

much
like

watery
flavor
is
a

taste
but
with
the
added

of
a
bit
of
extra

clean
and
slightly
bittersweet
not

i
hope
i
never

but
besides
that
as
i
didnt
start
feeling
the
high
life
with
this
one
until
i
had
nearly
6
under
my
belt
nevertheless
they
actually
did
a
decent
job
of
retaining
most
of
the
taste
of
miller
high
life
it
does
a
better
job
there
than
mgd
light
matching
up
with
regular
mgd
high

light
is
still
a
light
beer
very
little
taste
pretty
horrifying
but
if
youve
already
had
a
lot
to
drink
i
suppose
it
goes
down
easily
enough
good

swill
ive
ingested
lots
of
it

never

bought
a
six
pack
and
went
to
the
beach
poured
on
a
pilsner
glass
looked
like
a
watery
yellow
pretty
nasty
smelled
like
corn
and
rice
taste
was
the
worst
defenitely
worst
beer
ive
had
in
my
life
i
could
give
it
a
0
but
i
cant
just
barely
had
1
and
gave
the
rest
to
some
random
guy
at
the
beach
dont
drink
this
beer
rock
bottom
its
about
as
bad
as
naty
lite
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lace
of
head
so
far
so
good
smells
like
all
the
other
putrid
adjunct
lagers
goes
down
kinda
harsh
highly
carbonated
dry
and
a
little
bitter
one
of
the
worst
adjunct
lagers
let
alone
light
lagers
avoid
have
you
guys
ever
seen
that
movie
with
the
dude
who
gets
all
mad
and
turns
into
a
more
jacked
up
dude
thats
kinda
green
yea
well
drinking
milwaukees
best
beast
is
kinda
like
that
but
less
green
seriously
ive
never
been
to
milwaukee
but
if
this
is
what
their
beer
is
like
its
probably
a
great
place
smooth
really
really
crisp
balanced
and
well
hopped
id
say
the
abv
is
a
little
low
for
my
purposes
but
when
youre
out
with
the
boys
it
gets
the
job
done
unleash
the
beast
low
d
my
fallback
beer
plenty
of
taste
i
didnt
say
great
taste
at
least
compared
to
keystone
overall
a
far
cry
from
milwaukees
best
premium
a
far
cry
from
anything
mild
lager
decent
taste
has
its
pros
and
cons
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
for
the
money
got
a
12
pack
for
6
ba
is
terrible
though
definitely
would
want
more
than
a
4
20
all
these
reviews
about
it
being
watery
i
can
understand
seeing
as
how
its
got
a
light
flavor
but
it
is
tolerable
probably
not
the
best
thing
that
comes
out
of
milwaukee
but
whos
to
say
when
a
beer
isnt
even
good
for
simmering
brats
citrussy
watery
refreshing
and
an
absolute
bargain
this
may
be
my
new
goto
summertime
brew
o
its
a
shitty
light
beer
that
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
three
months
it
was
time
to
make
room
for
better
product
i
will
drink
the
other
7
after
i
am
drunk
sometime
and
need
a
water
to
sober
up
a
real
cult
classic
one
for
the
whole
family
the
feel
good
hit
of
the
summer
or
something
for
a
really
cheap
beer
i
thought
it
was
actually
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
the
first
time
i
tried
this
was
on
a
hot
summers
day
after
work
in
2012
the
special
at
the
bar
was
short
pitcher
of
the
beast
for
3
dollars
the
flavor
of
the
beer
was
ok
but
nothing
special
the
look
of
the
beer
actually
varied
from
a
dark
brownish
color
to
a
light
yellowish
color
for
a
daily
special
at
a
bar
it
wasnt
a
terrible
bargain
or
price
but
as
of
rating
it
was
o
overall
probably
the
best
out
of
the
milwaukee
series
id
have
at
a
party
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
beer
which
and
you
will
be
consuming
large
amounts
of
said
beer
this
is
the
one
for
you
spelunky
spelunky
spelunky
spelunky
god
am
i
garbage
here
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
flowers
mild
grass
and
a
decent
amount
of
soap
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
decidedly
funky
wheat
the
end
result
is
an
odd
melange
of
metallic
sour
and
bitter
suffice
it
to
say
it
doesnt
taste
good
at
all
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
depressing
offering
one
i
dont
hope
to
tangle
with
again
any
time
soon

d
it
is
what
it
is
im
just
glad
im
not
in
highschool
anymore
man
back
in
the
day
you
could
score
these
so
cheap
like
29
99
a
keg
at
discount
liquors
in
milwaukee
mouthfeel
is
just
some
sweetness
metallic
corn
insides
probably
ok
for
beer
pong
if
youre
young
and
dumb
ive
had
worse
beers
but
not
too
many
this
beers
main
sin
is
that
it
lacks
any
substance
id
recommend
only
if
you
need
a
palate
cleanser
even
on
a
hot
day
theres
plenty
of
flavorful
yet
light
options
out
there
overall
it
is
a
light
beer
and
not
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
the
price
is
good
about
7
for
a
12
pack
so
if
you
want
something
to
quench
your
thirst
with
a
lititle
bit
of
a
beer
bite
this
will
do
it
o
peasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
have
been
on
the
hunt
for
a
go
to
light
beer
and
this
one
is
not
disappointing
solid
taste
and
mouthfeel
for
a
light
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
beer
that
does
not
taste
too
light
for
an
american
adjunct
light
lager
give
this
one
a
try
above
average
for
the
style
not
much
of
an
appearance
with
about
a
1
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
like
watered
down
water
beer
taste
like
a
normal
american
pilsner
which
lacks
much
flavor
or
imagination
really
crisp
and
tastes
pretty
much
how
it
smells
and
looks
lets
face
it
this
is
a
drinking
game
beer
so
leave
it
for
the
tailgates
or
beer
pong
unless
of
course
its
free
then
the
free
beer
rule
applies
not
super
offensive
but
not
very
good
i
could
live
the
rest
of
my
days
without
ever
drinking
this
again
free
beer
rule
does
not
apply
here
this
generic
american
beer
by
miller
is
terrible
and
this
is
coming
from
a
natty
light
fan
i
decided
to
give
this
beer
a
try
as
its
in
the
same
price
range
as
natural
light
and
it
sucked
i
got
a
24
pack
box
of
cans
as
i
didnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
money
but
wanted
a
couple
days
worth
of
beer
big
mistake
this
beer
is
swill
it
tastes
like
beer
flavored
water
even
for
a
cheap
beer
i
was
expecting
better
the
buzz
even
after
45
beers
was
really
weak
i
will
never
again
buy
this
brand
of
beer
ever
was
probably
the
beer
of
choice
when
i
was
in
college
just
because
it
is
very
cheap
it
is
that
cheap
for
a
reason
because
it
is
not
very
good
poor
taste
and
potent
aftertaste
but
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
them
making
it
very
popular
for
the
college
atmosphere
therefore
goes
down
very
easily
but
too
watered
down
and
has
not
much
of
a
taste
to
it
not
too
pure
and
not
that
smooth
but
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
them
the
metallic
and
applelike
sweetness
of
this
gave
it
no
chance
the
flavor
profile
was
so
mild
as
to
be
almost
nonexistent
im
not
a
fan
no
matter
how
cheap
it
is
rjt
pretty
much
what
i
expected
from
this
one
if
you
enjoy
bmc
light
beers
save
your
money
and
buy
this
the
price
is
quite
lower
and
the
quality
is
identical
to
other
light
premium
brands
id
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
but
wouldnt
pay
for
it
this
is
truly
a
horrific
beer
id
like
to
know
what
milwaukees
worst
is
if
this
is
the
best
tough
to
swallow
without
gagging
a
little
bit
i
suppose
if
it
were
the
end
of
the
world
and
this
is
all
i
could
find
i
would
scarf
it
down
quickly
can
only
be
used
as
a
partyget
drunk
quick
beer
no
way
can
you
sip
and
enjoy
something
like
this
for
the
price
i
suppose
it
serves
a
purpose
but
its
certainly
not
a
craft
beer
nor
would
it
have
much
appeal
to
those
with
a
refined
beer
palate
a
frathouse
special
to
be
sure
pours
a
light
clear
yellow
fizzy
head
dies
down
to
nothing
very
light
pale
grainmalt
flavor
just
a
flash
of
ghost
hop
bitterness
when
ice
cold
it
goes
down
fairly
fast
though
the
flavor
is
almost
nonexistant
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
crisp
soda
water
like
overall
good
beer
if
you
dont
like
beer
how
disappointing
i
held
out
hope
that
you
would
pull
through
in
the
end
but
didnt
beer
is
super
thin
watery
has
a
late
bitterness
mild
pilsen
sweetness
up
front
midpalate
vegetalness
at
least
there
isnt
an
aftertaste
i
dont
think
ill
ever
bother
having
this
again
but
i
imagine
this
is
exactly
what
they
want
flavored
water
i
dont
really
like
it
overall
but
at
least
i
drank
one
now
i
know
and
knowing
is
half
the
battle
ya
it
hurts
to
think
that
i
did
this
to
my
body
back
in
the
90s
heck
it
hurts
to
think
that
i
did
this
to
my
body
last
night
never
again
it
is
piss
gold
tastes
like
corn
with
crap
carbonated
like
a
soda
and
overall
just
should
never
touch
my
tongue
again
pours
a
light
pale
yellow
color
some
carbonation
little
fizzy
white
head
with
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
kinda
malty
grainy
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
grainyricy
light
body
not
drinkable
would
make
a
thirst
quencher
though
d
easy
as
water
but
boring
as
it
gets
this
is
definately
not
a
beer
to
pour
into
a
glass
i
only
did
it
for
the
review
just
drink
it
from
the
can
but
if
im
low
on
cash
i
prefer
this
to
bud
or
coors
anyday
thin
bodied
a
lot
of
carbonation
has
a
dry
finish
and
does
not
have
one
impressive
quality
this
is
swill
at
its
worst
avoid
this
beer
d
good
if
you
plan
on
throwing
a
party
with
beer
pong
or
if
youre
too
thirsty
to
care
about
how
it
tastes
otherwise
dont
bother
pours
a
nasty
looking
straw
yellow
white
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
grain
and
booze
tastes
of
some
sort
of
grain
and
nasty
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
rocky
and
has
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
very
good
not
a
very
good
beer
at
all
stay
away
from
it
if
you
can
do
this
guy
mysteriously
ended
up
in
the
fridge
one
day
and
has
been
sitting
there
for
a
good
6
to
9
months
havent
a
clue
where
it
came
from
glad
its
gone
now
taking
up
too
much
space
overall
another
that
i
would
never
go
near
again
d
its
a
light
lager
its
better
than
most
but
this
still
isnt
much
of
anything
i
enjoyed
so
go
ahead
shottie
these
all
through
the
night
with
your
friends
but
dont
expect
an
actual
good
beer
just
to
drink
for
the
sake
of
enjoying
beer
while
sessioning
or
otherwise
this
is
a
social
beer
plain
and
simple
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
for
the
style
this
is
what
it
should
be
taste
what
i
said
of
the
smell
is
also
true
of
the
taste
sweet
cereal
grains
almost
nonexistent
hops
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
corn
some
malts
taste
is
basically
missing
in
action
beer
flavored
water
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
not
the
worst
light
beer
i
have
had
but
nothing
special
overall
just
because
the
smell
isnt
miserable
and
the
taste
doesnt
commit
any
crimes
either
ill
bump
this
up
a
little
bit
on
the
drinkability
scale
overall
honestly
this
is
not
offensive
its
just
very
tame
will
continue
to
give
you
gas
the
morning
after
d
goes
down
like
water
simply
because
there
isnt
enough
taste
to
savor
and
its
best
to
do
it
quickly
before
the
stench
overwhelms
i
finally
reviewed
my
fathers
sentimental
favorite
and
it
came
off
just
as
expected
notes
beer
flavored
water
anyone
the
same
as
most
light
lagersadjuncts
d
no
taste
or
at
least
a
very
slight
and
undesirable
taste
and
goes
down
like
water
horrendous
drinkability
the
unpleasantness
of
the
taste
makes
this
a
beer
you
either
have
to
chug
or
not
drink
at
all
a
golden
yellow
rather
fizzy
beer
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
no
aroma
except
for
maybe
stale
malts
that
are
hardly
noticeable
a
very
slight
taste
of
hops
and
malt
more
like
carbonated
water
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
it
does
the
job
to
say
the
least
drinkability
extremely
light
on
the
stomach
so
i
could
see
someone
going
through
several
of
these
with
ease
with
that
said
this
is
not
a
beer
i
will
ever
pick
up
for
myself
but
my
dad
seems
to
enjoy
them
well
by
enjoy
i
mean
its
cheap
and
it
gets
you
drunk
im
glad
i
found
a
world
of
far
better
beers
to
enjoy
the
drinkability
is
what
gets
me
and
many
others
out
of
the
can
anyway
its
not
bitter
as
many
of
the
bad
cheapos
are
its
even
borderline
refreshing
the
milwaukees
best
brand
seems
to
be
a
cult
following
and
its
drinkers
are
almost
proud
to
be
so
count
me
in
as
a
follower
i
cant
believe
my
friends
convinced
me
to
drink
this
the
beer
pours
and
extremely
light
gold
a
thin
bubbly
head
quickly
fades
into
nothing
with
barely
any
lacing
the
smell
is
the
average
sicklysweet
scent
of
corn
malts
that
are
too
weak
to
even
cover
up
what
little
alcohol
is
here
the
taste
is
not
terrible
its
got
that
harsh
shitty
malts
hops
beast
taste
but
toned
down
so
it
is
pretty
tolerable
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
it
goes
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
as
with
all
light
beers
the
drinkability
is
the
best
part
this
beer
is
too
damn
drinkable
this
beer
is
my
closet
indulgence
that
i
love
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
while
mowing
the
lawn
or
with
friends
on
summer
days
when
planning
to
imbibe
many
i
love
my
micros
but
this
is
the
cheap
macro
that
i
always
fall
back
on
for
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
i
always
have
it
on
hand
and
probably
always
will
carbonated
water
is
the
main
flavor
here
with
a
bit
of
sweet
corny
grains
making
up
the
remainder
surprisingly
it
does
have
a
noticeable
hop
bitterness
and
clean
finish
to
it
it
falls
a
bit
short
of
average
for
a
light
lager
mainly
due
to
the
lack
of
discernable
flavor
light
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
and
taste
are
light
adjuncts
smooth
and
when
ice
cold
is
really
a
hell
of
a
beer
the
perfect
summer
outing
beer
highly
recommended
for
outdoor
activities
of
all
kinds
this
is
something
that
i
always
have
and
always
will
purchase
a
finger
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
nose
was
lightly
sweet
with
some
cereal
in
the
background
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
kind
of
thin
without
much
taste
to
recount
it
was
yet
another
hohum
offering
in
a
can
come
on
there
have
to
be
some
good
beers
in
a
can
out
there
i
just
seem
to
have
exhausted
the
string
milwaukees
best
light
was
light
golden
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
bubbly
white
head
that
somehow
managed
to
stick
around
a
little
while
and
left
a
little
lacing
behind
the
smell
was
light
and
a
little
grainy
the
taste
was
very
light
and
with
a
dry
sort
of
grainy
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
watery
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkabity
was
below
average
its
just
another
tasteless
light
beer
the
only
thing
it
has
going
for
it
is
the
price
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
an
okay
head
the
smell
is
of
corn
and
a
small
malt
the
taste
is
of
grain
and
some
malt
it
is
very
light
but
it
is
there
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
carbonation
the
overall
drinkability
of
the
beer
is
pretty
low
it
is
much
like
all
macros
this
is
my
least
favorite
beer
however
it
amazes
me
to
see
how
popular
it
is
seems
like
the
cheap
price
is
the
catch
so
i
have
dubbed
it
trailer
trash
beer
not
that
i
have
anything
against
trailer
parks
i
grew
up
in
one
if
you
drink
enough
of
these
you
will
forget
how
really
awful
they
are
like
ugly
women
becoming
beautiful
when
youre
drunk
still
it
has
this
appeal
like
a
prostitute
down
and
dirty
i
like
it
laughing
as
i
bump
a
few
scores
allowed
to
warm
a
slight
bit
and
the
flavor
did
improve
the
astringency
was
gone
still
doesnt
taste
good
but
i
will
bump
a
little
the
drinkability
improved
when
the
beer
was
slightly
warmed
up
di
only
have
1
and
im
only
having
one
this
one
is
going
down
nicely
so
im
seeing
the
drinkablilty
side
of
this
im
wondering
about
the
next
day
aftereffects
if
id
settle
into
a
serious
session
water
is
the
mouthfeel
water
with
some
bubbles
d
it
is
better
than
some
of
the
other
ultra
cheap
macros
out
there
but
lets
be
serious
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
big
fizzy
white
head
that
faded
very
quicklyno
lacing
aroma
of
corncardboardand
sweet
baby
vomit
flavor
at
first
is
almost
nonexistantbut
as
it
warms
a
couple
of
degrees
it
takes
on
an
odd
sweet
metallic
tastethin
body
and
stinky
finish
i
can
drink
this
if
i
am
dying
from
thirst
but
save
your
money
and
buy
some
real
beer
eh
overall
i
wouldnt
ever
buy
this
or
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
can
see
this
as
being
a
college
beer
pong
beer
but
that
is
about
it
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
little
head
and
no
retention
slight
lacing
smells
of
an
adjunct
lager
fits
the
style
slightly
sweeter
than
milwaukees
best
ice
low
carbonation
and
tastes
mostly
of
adjunct
in
a
weak
lager
overall
not
worth
recommending
this
one
blows
its
bigger
brother
away
probably
because
the
rank
taste
and
odor
is
supplanted
by
water
lighter
yellow
pour
bubbly
white
head
sweeter
beerlike
aroma
malt
hops
really
taste
is
not
awful
kind
of
crisp
and
mineral
water
but
with
actual
beer
taste
and
its
not
ass
be
kind
to
yourself
drink
somethin
else
this
just
another
low
flavor
high
popularity
brew
very
blow
average
as
far
as
macrolagers
go
you
can
find
better
beers
in
the
same
price
range
than
this
one
fizzy
ricewater
taste
to
start
with
little
head
retention
should
you
even
want
to
pour
this
type
of
beer
into
a
glass
and
no
aroma
to
speak
of
sorry
but
this
ones
no
good
d
poor
this
is
watery
as
hell
and
flavorless
to
boot
shame
i
like
the
ice
version
of
milwaukees
best
the
college
kids
beer
of
choice
a
cheap
source
of
beer
but
this
hovers
somewhere
between
a
foul
beer
and
a
glass
of
water
very
pale
corn
grain
musty
dirty
malty
taste
there
really
isnt
much
else
to
say
i
think
everyone
knows
what
this
beer
tastes
like
or
has
a
pretty
good
idea
appearance
is
watered
down
tinkle
yellow
the
head
pillows
up
real
big
and
nice
then
dies
off
almost
as
fast
the
smell
is
nearly
nonexistant
taste
is
surprisingly
less
offensive
than
the
other
ultracheap
beers
i
found
this
much
more
tolerable
than
that
of
natural
light
and
busch
light
and
even
pbr
back
off
fanboys
that
trash
is
uberswill
there
is
a
tad
of
metallic
aftertaste
but
it
doesnt
last
long
enough
to
bother
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
smooth
given
the
overall
lack
of
flavor
drinkability
seems
a
bit
high
as
its
so
watered
down
and
nonoffensive
i
could
probably
crush
a
6pack
of
tallboys
and
then
get
started
on
some
real
beer
with
no
problem
this
isnt
terrible
it
just
isnt
good
ill
be
spending
my
money
on
something
else
from
now
on
pale
straw
color
and
crystal
clear
body
with
a
tiny
glaze
of
cap
smell
is
sweet
and
corny
taste
is
similar
but
fairly
weak
and
easy
to
ignore
mouthfeel
is
likewise
unmemorable
it
is
clean
and
relatively
smooth
good
in
hot
weather
or
if
you
want
to
tie
one
on
at
a
frat
party
taste
is
almost
non
existent
i
must
say
you
could
conceivably
drink
a
few
of
these
as
they
go
down
like
water
poured
a
12oz
can
into
my
united
we
stand
pint
glass
this
is
my
standard
go
to
glass
for
really
cheap
beer
the
appearance
is
definitely
off
for
the
style
while
its
the
normal
straw
yellow
there
is
absolutely
no
head
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
i
couldnt
get
much
more
than
just
a
thin
layer
of
white
bubbles
at
the
top
that
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sour
there
is
a
odd
off
smell
to
it
that
is
kind
of
muddled
with
a
bit
off
corn
aroma
with
what
reminds
me
of
soy
sauce
the
taste
is
bland
there
is
really
nothing
over
or
under
whelming
in
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
really
thin
for
the
style
with
no
hint
of
sharp
carbonation
this
beer
is
really
just
nothing
which
is
the
worst
part
about
it
i
would
rather
have
a
beer
that
is
just
flat
out
horrible
than
this
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
will
never
drink
another
i
thought
the
beast
was
bad
but
milwaukees
best
takes
the
cake
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
poor
white
head
the
nose
is
of
corn
rice
and
a
few
other
things
tht
dont
belong
in
beer
taste
is
really
bitter
for
a
light
beer
at
least
make
you
beer
tasteless
guys
the
body
is
watery
and
i
will
probably
never
drink
this
again
there
is
nothing
better
than
mowing
the
lawn
on
the
hottest
summber
day
and
then
slamming
an
ice
cold
mbl
there
is
nothing
worse
than
snowblowing
the
driveway
and
having
to
choke
down
a
mbl
at
any
temperature
dont
ask
me
why
it
tase
good
in
hot
weather
but
that
is
the
nature
of
the
beast
like
others
have
said
before
me
this
isnt
a
beer
that
was
meant
to
be
savored
its
a
beer
to
drink
to
get
smashed
immediately
after
tasting
this
memories
of
keg
parties
from
my
college
years
came
back
yes
it
was
exactly
the
same
stuff
its
cheap
doesnt
really
taste
great
but
if
someone
was
going
to
have
50
friends
and
strangers
in
their
house
would
they
spend
major
bucks
for
craft
beer
in
a
keg
that
would
be
pretty
cool
though
it
looks
like
nasty
tastes
nasty
but
has
alot
of
memories
as
it
was
what
i
drank
at
parties
in
college
this
is
you
standard
light
lager
it
tastes
like
lightly
watered
hops
medium
carbonation
overall
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
however
i
cant
say
it
was
any
worse
then
any
other
light
beer
let
me
start
of
by
saying
this
review
wont
help
anybody
the
beast
is
what
it
is
this
isnt
the
beer
you
bring
to
your
girlfriends
parents
house
to
impress
her
dad
this
beer
requires
everyone
to
turn
of
the
beer
snob
and
get
blacked
out
try
to
hookup
and
then
try
to
piece
it
all
together
the
next
morning
if
you
have
to
drink
a
light
beer
this
is
as
good
as
any
i
am
a
little
older
and
pretty
much
only
drink
dank
beers
now
but
i
am
not
above
drinking
beast
in
july
with
my
old
buddies
go
flyers
d
yet
again
im
drinking
this
only
because
of
beer
pong
this
weekend
and
unless
your
playing
drinking
games
its
not
worth
it
d
this
is
not
a
good
beer
even
for
a
session
or
lawnmower
beer
drinking
a
couple
one
night
did
not
make
me
feel
good
two
ice
cold
cans
poured
into
a
small
pitcher
for
an
anything
but
a
cup
themed
party
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
3
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
that
actually
lasted
a
good
while
and
left
some
good
lacingvery
surprised
actually
basically
no
smell
or
taste
very
unoffensive
which
is
generally
what
these
beers
aim
for
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
dry
good
drinkability
for
those
that
like
me
are
willing
to
lower
their
standards
in
the
name
of
inebriation
good
for
getting
you
drunk
not
really
anything
to
savor
except
the
surprisingly
nice
appearance
but
it
certainly
gets
the
job
done
pale
gold
and
stinky
right
off
the
bat
we
must
mention
that
this
beer
has
only
one
purpose
drinking
mass
quantities
at
extremely
low
prices
this
is
the
ultimate
college
campus
beer
and
considering
its
purpose
its
not
that
bad
its
pale
no
head
doesnt
smell
good
watery
tastes
like
nothing
with
a
touch
of
maltyness
blah
blah
blah
that
doesnt
matter
its
ten
bucks
a
30
pack
98
calories
and
3
5
carbs
a
piece
with
a
decent
4
5
alcohol
its
tolerable
enough
1823
yearsolds
across
america
should
love
this
beer
i
did
a
dozen
years
ago
i
miss
those
days
d
drinkable
as
water
nothing
bad
but
nothing
good
to
this
one
not
much
smell
heck
not
much
taste
either
while
i
can
say
the
taste
that
this
beer
does
has
is
not
really
objectionable
theres
really
not
much
there
its
just
this
side
of
water
although
i
suppose
its
drinkable
if
you
were
thirsty
but
you
could
do
much
better
not
the
greatest
beer
ever
and
probably
not
in
the
top
1000
but
it
is
a
beer
with
exceptional
drinkability
the
appearance
and
smell
are
pretty
poor
but
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
help
a
little
its
a
very
cheap
beer
usually
costing
about
1415
bucks
not
good
for
sipping
only
for
college
parties
where
you
wanna
get
a
cheap
buzz
went
down
really
easy
could
easily
drink
a
12
pack
if
somebody
wanted
to
i
would
never
drink
this
beer
again
the
only
reason
why
i
have
to
is
because
my
roommate
looked
at
my
profile
on
this
site
and
saw
that
i
havent
review
milwaukees
best
light
there
is
a
reason
why
i
waited
almost
2
years
to
drink
this
beer
its
shit
one
of
the
shittest
out
there
overall
a
lowertiered
light
macro
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
decent
drinkability
because
its
so
cheap
and
ice
cold
its
dulled
so
much
that
its
drinkable
maybe
a
lawn
mowing
beer
drinkability
one
could
drink
many
of
these
if
he
did
not
desire
flavor
and
complexity
i
found
it
rather
tasteless
and
boring
drinkability
one
of
those
cheap
beers
that
has
no
purpose
except
to
get
you
crunk
ya
know
overall
id
say
one
of
the
better
cheap
lights
i
would
still
say
suck
up
the
extra
35
calories
and
go
with
regular
mils
best
clear
golden
green
yellow
body
that
has
lots
of
bubbles
from
the
carbonation
head
is
short
and
white
and
has
faded
by
the
end
of
this
sentence
stinky
wheat
on
the
nose
very
clean
and
crisp
as
it
enters
the
mouth
super
east
to
drink
but
lacks
any
flavor
points
that
make
it
stand
out
from
any
other
bmc
product
actually
stands
up
well
to
slightly
more
costly
mainstream
bmc
products
for
the
price
overall
this
beer
is
a
joke
the
awful
taste
trumps
any
average
appearance
no
taste
here
just
swill
and
not
even
refreshing
at
that
id
rather
drink
mich
ultra
at
least
it
tastes
like
clean
water
instead
of
lead
infested
water
this
beer
almost
makes
me
like
poker
less
almost
yet
i
know
if
anybody
drinks
this
stuff
at
the
table
they
might
as
well
hand
me
their
wallet
milwaukees
best
light
pours
a
typical
macro
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
sixteen
ounce
can
smells
like
cooked
vegetables
and
corn
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
up
front
fading
into
corn
not
very
good
by
any
standard
i
would
rather
pay
a
little
more
and
get
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
this
is
really
beer
for
frat
boys
only
i
could
drink
this
if
i
wanted
to
be
cheap
and
get
drunk
clear
medium
straw
with
a
medium
white
quickly
diminishing
head
smells
of
corn
and
weak
grain
tastes
like
fizzy
water
with
some
adjunct
beer
flavor
and
a
metallic
finish
it
has
a
thin
body
watery
texture
and
sodalike
carbonation
its
really
cheap
and
tastes
it
but
at
least
it
wasnt
that
offensive
well
other
than
that
they
try
to
pass
this
off
as
beer
beast
light
what
can
you
say
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
sized
head
smells
like
cool
urine
with
a
hint
of
sweat
taste
almost
instantly
induces
vomiting
typical
pilsner
beer
but
worse
doesnt
go
down
smoothly
at
all
but
is
the
most
affordable
beer
out
there
and
by
that
token
it
has
some
merit
only
drink
this
if
you
hate
yourself
and
you
want
to
stop
enjoying
the
beer
drinking
experience
the
beast
lite
is
obviously
not
going
to
be
to
great
of
a
beer
and
it
really
looks
like
carbonated
water
but
once
you
move
past
that
you
realize
that
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
quite
crisp
with
a
smooth
carbonation
level
wont
fill
you
up
at
all
a
slight
sweetness
comes
and
goes
rather
quickly
refreshing
but
boring
not
terrible
poured
a
pale
yellow
colow
with
large
white
puffy
head
that
rapidly
disappeared
smell
is
slight
anf
barely
noticeable
with
maybe
a
slight
sweetness
and
light
beer
aroma
present
taste
follows
through
with
a
very
light
flavor
with
little
malt
or
hops
present
finishes
refreshing
but
little
else
ok
as
a
spacer
note
to
miller
just
because
its
brewed
for
a
refreshing
smooth
taste
does
not
mean
that
it
is
actually
refreshing
andor
smooth
it
gains
a
point
for
drinkability
only
because
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
and
as
a
nod
of
respect
to
legions
of
college
students
that
may
subsist
on
this
beer
and
others
of
a
similar
ilk
though
to
them
i
say
for
gods
sake
your
metabolism
is
running
high
at
this
point
in
your
life
live
a
little
and
at
least
opt
for
the
nonlite
version
notes

make
to
be
drunk
quickly
and
from
the
can
while
not
filling
you
up
it
works
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
but
its
just
not
worth
it
there
are
better
light
lagers
even
the
cheap
stuff
good
only
for
drinking
games
what
can
i
say
for
the
price
8case
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
tastes
best
in
the
summertime
after
working
in
the
yard
but
overall
its
not
as
bad
as
some
of
the
other
reviews
the
color
is
a
light
gold
with
a
mild
smell
and
not
much
of
a
head
when
poured
into
a
glass
i
prefer
the
darker
micro
brews
but
when
drinking
the
lighter
lower
cal
beers
the
biggest
difference
between
the
hometown
bud
light
and
this
beer
is
price
about
half
as
much
as
bud
light
drinkability
extremely
light
on
the
palate
so
i
could
see
someone
going
through
several
of
these
with
ease
i
find
most
of
these
macro
lagers
to
be
pretty
indistinguishable
im
glad
i
found
a
world
of
far
better
beers
to
enjoy
so
long
beast
can
provided
amid
a
bunch
of
stuff
given
to
me
for
volunteering

sodalike
head
over
a
clear
pale
straw
orange
liquid
the
head
settles
stickily
and
is
fed
by
a
few
streamers
smells
noticably
malty
sweet
and
with
floral
hop
aroma
its
weak
but
much
stronger
than
i
was
expecting
the
sweet
is
fairly
nondescript
corn
and
wet
cardboard
the
hops
are
light
like
a
hallertauer
tastes
watery
with
a
very
mild
sweet
pizza
crust
imagine
a
really
thin
and
cardboardy
crust
thats
got
no
toppings
and
a
noticable
hop
flavor
in
the
tongue
the
hops
come
on
stronger
in
the
back
of
the
throat
during
the
aftertaste
carbonation
is
only
mdheavy
but
still
contributes
a
bit
of
sting
to
the
flavor
especially
in
the
aftertaste
where
it
comes
across
as
iron
thin
body
but
with
some
dextrinous
cling
simple
and
much
better
than
i
was
anticipating
id
never
buy
this
beer
for
my
fridge
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
judged
to
style
not
my
preferences
if
they
called
this
alcoholic
tonic
water
id
buy
it
since
they
call
it
beer
but
finishes
mostly
clean
no
detectable
hop
taste
or
aroma
the
lack
of
flavor
leaves
nothing
to
mask
the
alcohol
this
one
never
should
have
been
consumed

pong
beer
is
what
its
good
for
just
a
very
average
beer
not
as
bad
as
many
mass
produced
light
lagers
on
the
market
but
still
nothing
i
would
buy
on
my
own
if
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
it
is
a
good
option
make
this
short
a
sweet
its
a
typically
light
beer
meaning
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
but
there
is
nothing
exceptional
about
it
its
a
good
easy
summer
drinker
and
its
decent
as
far
as
many
beers
of
this
style
go
but
exceptional
it
is
not
good
light
beer
original
that
started
it
all
this
beer
tastes
like
gold
my
favorite
lite
beer
for
casual
drinking
not
a
bad
beer
but
hey
you
get
what
you
pay
for
better
than
bud
and
coors
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
its
the
best
of
the
light
macros
way
better
than
coors
or
bud
this
is
the
only
light
beer
that
i
can
truly
enjoy
casually
drinking
besides

drinkable

meh
taste
and
looks

i
wouldnt
drink
it
if
someone
paid
me
too
just
horrible
my
first
favorite
beer
when
i
was
a
kid
crappy
but
better
than
bl
this
is
the
worst
of
the
macro
lites
its
passable
on
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
this
is
my
go
to
everyday
beer
light
refreshing
going
to
a
football
game
shotguning
a
beer
golfing
or
just
hanging
out
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
looks
pale
yellow
medium
carbonation
the
taste
is
not
bad
at
all
but
it
is
lacking
in
flavor
comes
across
watery
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavor
at
the
end
extremely
sessionable
and
also
affordable
yuk
this
is
really
bad
there
are
no
words
for
this
beer
awfulawful
awful
just
awful
miller
lite
always
tastes
like
beer
not
sure
if
that
makes
sense
but
it
seems
that
every
time
i
have
one
i
think
to
myself
this
is
exactly
how
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
very
bland
tasting
lager
not
worth
the
effort
to
drink
taste
taste
is
exactly
how
it
smells
like
carbonated

watered
down
mess
of
a

either
or

quality
meh

meh
look

get
what
you
pay
for
this
is
the
best
tasting
lawnmower
beer
and
everyday
drinker
gives
least
amount
of
hangover
and
has
best
taste
for
any
american
style
lite
beer
best
beer
for
a
night
out
drinking
4
beers
and
not
feeling
bloated
and
sick
that
night
or
next
day
if
you
are
in
a
situation
where
you
are
drinking
for
a
long
period
of
time
there
is
simply
no
better
choice
out
of
the
aal
category
this
isnt
too
bad
especially
compared
to
light
beers
at
least
has
a
good
amount
flavor
compared
to
the
other
light
beers
im
reaching
for
this
over
corona
dos
equis
heineken
coors
light
and
bud
every
single
day
if
thats
whats
available
by
far
the
best
light
beer
its
the
bag
of
chips
for
beer
where
you
buy
a
bag
of
chips
for
the
snack
contentc
you
mostly
get
air
you
buy
miller
for
the
beer
and
get
water
its
ok
for
what
it
is
i
love
this
beer
its
got
great
taste
for
a
great
price
all
depends
on
your
expectations
good
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
way
better
than
bud
light
or
coors
light
why
did
i
drink
this
miller
lite
one
sip
and
youll
know
its
miller
lite
pretty
distinctive
taste
you
can
taste
the
watered
down
feeling
of
the
beverage
here
in
the
midwest
chicagomilwaukee
area
its
quite
popular
and
served
at
virtually
every
bar
in
the
area
exceptional
at
the
very
best
overall
its
better
than
bud
light
so
is
most
stuff
good
look
light
taste
but
a
little
different
its
a
light
beer
and
its
not
good
i
can
remember
buying
this
brand
when
they
came
in
eight
packs
of
the
little
bottles
when
i
was
a
kid
these
little
bottles
were
popular
for
cruising
down
the
road
because
of
course
you
could
drink
them
fast
but
they
also
fit
in
your
hand
really
well
and
were
the
best
for
throwing
at
road
signs
and
mailboxes
i
think
schmidt
big
mouth
barrels
were
the
best
for
this
or
mickeys
grenades
hitting
one
of
those
signs
is
harder
than
you
might
think
because
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
speed
of
the
vehicle
etc
so
dont
knock
it
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
a
very
light
beer
with
a
decent
taste
good
for
summer
average
light
beer
and
my
favorite
of
all
the
macro
lights
a
little
cleaner
than
the
rest
overall
what
really
is
there
to
discuss
about
this
beer
it
is
simple
it
is
light
it
is
intently
mild
in
flavoring
obviously
a
popular
beer
for
the
masses
weve
had
this
one
countless
times
before
the
occasion
for
rating
came
at
a
friends
wedding
and
it
was
used
mainly
as
a
palate
cleanser
between
much
more
satisfying
nips
of
delicious
bourbon
trying
to
have
a
accurate
list
of
beers
ive
had
and
it
sucks
that
this
is
on
it
although
it
isnt
my
first
choice
anymore
i
still
dont
mind
drinking
it
it
was
my
go
to
in
high
school
and
is
easy
to
drink
in
large
quantities
not
a
beer
to
really
enjoy
use
it
like
the
pink
pickled
ginger
you
get
with
sushi
as
a
palate
cleanser
and
youre
on
defensible
ground
but
in
any
other
situation
if
you
order
this
over
other
craft
options
then
yeah
maybe
you
are
a
bad
person
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
it
the
old
school
logo
tricks
me
into
buying
this
every
now
and
then
in
the
summer
id
put
it
a
bit
higher
than
bud
light
overall
it
is
what
it
is
no
off
flavors
and
not
offensive
but
not
much
different
from
mineral
water
either
nothing
special
here
just
another
watered
down
light
beer
easy
to
drink
but
that
is
most
likely
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
my
rating
is
purely
from
the
perspective
of
aals
this
is
my
goto
volumedrinking
beer
when
quantity
is
the
name
of
the
game
caloricallylow
decent
enough
taste
to
bang
down
in
between
higher
quality
beers
also
a
mainstay
in
my
beer
fridge
lite
looks
like
piss
smells
nothing
like
good
beer
and
has
an
aroma
of
old
stale
keg
but
alas
lest
we
forget
it
tastes
great
i
wont
drink
coors
light
or
bud
light
but
for
some
reason
a
12
pack
of
lite
by
miller
never
seems
like
a
bad
decision
after
they
are
gone
it
just
really
damned
drinkable
period
i
cant
say
that
about
whale
testicle
beer
now
can
i
really
bad
beer
it
smellstastes
like
beer
that
has
sat
out
for
a
few
days
water
added
then
refrigerated
maybe
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
drank
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
i
know
that
the
rating
system
is
never
supposed
to
be
all
1s
or
all
5s
i
get
it
but
theres
no
hope
for
miller
with
this
one
they
should
probably
just
shut
down
and
stop
feeding
the
bros
classic
american
beer
for
holidays
i
feel
like
a
fool
for
never
reviewing
this
as
i
have
had
10456
of
them
if
i
give
it
a
bad
review
it
will
make
me
look
like
a
masochist
one
of
things
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
i
can
buy
a
30
pack
at
costco
for
45
cents
once
i
get
them
home
i
find
them
to
be
either
a
nice
way
to
start
the
night
as
they
dont
count
as
a
drink
or
a
great
way
to
end
the
night
dont
waste
a
good
drink
if
you
cant
stand
up
this
beer
is
liquid
and
not
poisonous
which
gives
it
good
points
it
has
little
taste
and
makes
me
pee
a
lot
which
is
bad
overall
i
will
likely
buy
500
more
of
them
this
year
so
i
give
it
a
thumbs
up
i
give
miller
lite
a
slightly
higher
overall
score
because
it
accomplishes
its
objective
well
its
a
cheap
ubiquitous
macro
beer
that
doesnt
completely
offend
the
palate
there
are
beers
a
whole
lot
worse
than
that
less
filling
tastes
fucking
great
an
average
cheap
beer
not
much
for
the
connoisseur
but
for
the
generic
bargoer
this
beer
is
pretty
good
moral
of
the
story
if
you
gotta
drink
miller
lite
drink
it
cold
and
drink
it
fast
decent
beer
although
a
bit
watered
down
but
for
the
price
you
cant
complain
american
classic
good
tailgating
beer
the
best
of
the
macro
piss
beers
imo
light
beer
what
do
you
expect
cheap
beer
i
guess
that
is
why
it
is
quite
popular
among
youth
heavily
used
for
beer
games
and
hence
nobody
can
ever
escape
it
i
wont
be
having
it
if
i
was
not
into
saving
money
why
am
i
drinking
this
a
waste
of
good
alcohol
units
beer
pong
only
there
are
better
cheap
brews
out
there
throwback
can
is
a
plus
miller
lite
is
underrated
it
belongs
on
a
different
scale
one
of
its
own
tastes
like
piss
gives
me
a
headache
to
boot
avoid
at
all
cost
for
a
light
beer
this
actually
has
decent
beer
flavor
i
can
taste
the
malts
and
even
some
hops
but
i
also
taste
a
corn
graininess
this
is
a
watery
beer
that
is
made
to
be
easydrinking
overall
its
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
if
it
was
all
malt
this
would
be
nice
but
alas
its
an
adjunct
lager
thats
probably
why
it
was
so
cheap
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
ice
cold
miller
lite
gets
the
job
done
with
low
calories
and
a
low
price
the
flavor
and
overall
experience
are
just
ok
but
for
what
it
is
as
a
cheap
light
adjunct
lager
its
pretty
good
for
a
lite
beer
it
is
pretty
good
not
a
fun
beer
or
enough
alcohol
to
be
worth
it
best
macro
light
beer
what
i
drink
after
a
couple
of
craft
beers
not
good
at
all
yuck
sucks
but
its
better
than
bud
light
best
macro
light
beer
what
i
drink
after
a
couple
crafts
overall
good
when
compared
to
other
macrobrews
in
its
class
your
typical
small
head
pale
yellow
beer
smelling
ever
so
slightly
of
hops
but
mostly
just
grain
slight
lemony
grain
flavor
with
a
crisp
finish
not
what
i
normally
drink
but
a
decent
buy
compared
to
budweiser
coors
busch
natty
light
etc
just
know
the
limitations
of
this
beer
before
buying
decent
cheap
aal
good
for
bbqs
as
good
as
pbr
or
stag
taste
is
not
the
deciding
factor
but
screw
bud
light
grandpa
and
old
mans
go
to
beer
so
i
got
a
nostalgic
feeling
about
it
i
would
rather
have
hamms
though
miller
is
decent
for
a
macro
light
bought
one
the
other
day
miller
is
good
better
than
bud
light
as
far
as
taste
compared
to
other
macro
light
lagers
this
is
a
good
one
more
flavor
ice
cold
its
a
refreshing
beer
i
rate
beers
in
this
category
against
others
in
its
class
against
bud
and
coors
this
one
is
probably
the
best
and
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
that
is
primarily
a
coors
drinker
i
dont
know
why
i
drink
it
more
than
miller
really
miller
really
is
better
if
you
like
to
take
a
glass
stick
it
in
the
toilet
after
a
fresh
piss
and
drink
it
then
this
beer
if
for
you
smell
is
non
existent
taste
reminds
me
of
a
fresh
swim
in
piss
river
color
is
light
amber
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
o
an
average
beer
all
things
considered
not
just
average
for
the
big
beers
but
average
for
any
pils
of
any
stripe
not
a
good
beer
but
the
best
of
the
worst
i
have
literally
drank
a
1000000
of
these
in
my
lifetime
give
or
take
100000
so
obviously
i
dont
hate
it
in
fact
i
have
to
admit
since
i
am
not
and
never
will
be
a
beer
snob

keep
a

stock
of
this
on

for

who
do

thought
it
was

to
do
a

review

this
beer
smells
like
a
doctors
office
kind
of
that
weird
super
sterile
alcohol
smell
that
makes
you
think
youll
get
a
super
virus
it
has
a
bitter
taste
with
a
slightly
skunky
aftertaste
at
least
is
is
pretty
smooth
so
it
does
have
that
going
for
it

but
it
is
also
alcoholic
and
you
will
start
to
feel
dizzy
when
you
drink
enough
of
it
its
virtue
is
that
it
is
more
palatable
than
some
other
domestic
beers
sold
in
the
usa
that
is
about
the
end
of
it

thanks
id
rather
drink
a

but
the
tornado
bottle
it
has
more
taste
than
other
mass
produced
american
lagers
and
that
taste
is
shit
god
the
only
thing
thats
worse
than
miller
lite
is
their
marketing
campaign
keep
fighting
the
good
fight

it
makes
me

can

had
this
on

because
my

had
nothing

so
i
caved
and
bought
one
with
my
burger
when
i
got
it
the

is

is

lite
is
not
a

beer
therefore
very
low
hop
bitterness
with
high
prickly
carbonation
the
beer
finishes
quite
dry
with
some
lingering
cereal
like
flavor
the
body
is
thin
and
carbonation
high
the
flavor
and
aftertaste
become
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
even
for
filling
that
niche
there
are

no
the

this

beer
in

alot
better

does

like

a

not

not
the
worst
thing
i
have
ever
tried
a
decent
bbq
brew
if
nothing
else
is
around
cuzcoapr

but
aggressively
carbonated
almost
abrasive
as
it
warms
the
taste
gets
worse
and
worse
until
it
tastes
sort
of
like
vomit
only
reason
im
drinking
this
one
because
im
all
out
of
my
tasty
ipas
and
these
are
left
over
from
when
i
had
friends
over
ages
ago

it
isnt
anything
exciting
either

light
body
mostly
cause
of
using
sugar
and
rice
to
keep

abv
up
but
this
is
accurate
to

light
lager
style
highly
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
want
a
bunch
of
these
they
are
boring

soulless

light

great
for
fat
rednecks
who
seem
to
be
enamored
with
this
style
pours
a
piss
yellow
clear
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
tiny
bit
of
head
smells
pretty
non
descript
like
malted
corn
no
triple
hops
on
the
nose
tastes
bland
and
unimpressive
corn
sweetness
not
much
else
going
on
the
slogan
on
the
poster
at
the
bar
is
can
you
taste
it
to
which
i
answer
no
decent
mouthfeel
and
as
drinkable
as
any
other
shitty
adjunct
lager
i
guess
does
this
deserve
an
f
no
is
it
tasty
no
is
it
refreshing
somewhat
will
i
have
more
in
the
future
of
course
for
an
inexpensive
afternoon
of
watching
basketball
with
the
guys
and
having
a
handful
of
brews
this
is
a
great
goto
theres
a
lot
i
dont
like
about
the
company
that
makes
this
beer
but
it
does
have
its
time
and
place
ill
finish
this
i
know
we
all
enjoy
the
hand
craft
beer
but
i
wanted
to
rate
my
favorite
light
macro
beer
this
is
a
go
to
beer
for
all
occasions
looks
like
a
macro
beer
clear
golden
yellow
clean
white
head
smell
of
grain
and
slight
hops
love
the
taste
for
a
light
lager
clean
and
crisp
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
drink
these
all
day
and
the
next
i
will
happily
drink
miller
lite
anytime
unless
im
really
in
the
mood
for
something
stronger
that
might
not
even
be
a
beer
not
bad
but
very
forgettable
nothing
in
this
beer
makes
it
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
not
really
worth
trying
unless
your
looking
for
large
quantity
for
a
cheap
price
a
pretty
benign
beer
great
for
mowing
the
lawn
or
painting
a
fence
to
be
avoided
at
best
light
body
high
carbonation
dry
and
unpleasant
from
top
to
bottom
i
suppose
this
drinks
quickly
but
the
flavor
nose
and
feel
all
suck
so
its
probably
best
to
get
this
one
over
with
as
soon
as
possible
thumbs
down
overall
nonoffensive
average
light
beer
bland
and
predictable
for
the
most
part
tastes
liek
your
alsmost
drinking
a
regular
beer
if
your
watching
calories
which
im
not
i
suggest
this
one
drinkable
sure
but
so
is
water
my
overall
impression
on
this
beer
though
is
not
a
very
good
one
when
i
was
in
college
i
used
to
drink
this
beer
by
the
case
now
i
cringe
at
the
thought
of
another
sip
unfortunately
im
never
really
one
of
those
guys
awful
would
never
be
my
first
choice
but
if
i
am
at
a
bar
or
party
and
they
are
serving
up
pitchers
of
miller
lite
i
will
happily
drink
it
piss
appearance
slight
bubble
gum
and
wheat
scent
tastes
like
a
mildly
spicy
wheat
better
than
most
of
the
other
american
adjunct
lagers
easy
drinking
all
night
no
harsh
flavors
whatsoever
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
satisfied
perhaps
the
best
taste
of
the
aals
but
nothing
worth
mentioning
as
a
beer
in
general
very
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
above
average
carbonation
goes
down
easily
just
not
sure
why
a
selfrespecting
craft
drinker
would
ever
go
this
route
except
for
reviewing
purposes
subdued
aftertaste
with
little
body
just
bland
overall
drinkability
all
things
considered
its
a
beer
you
can
pound
and
get
drunk
on
and
that
is
pretty
much
it
there
isnt
really
much
of
anything
to
consider
while
drinking
it
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
its
cheap
clear
light
yellow
with
slightly
soapy
head
which
disappears
quickly
very
light
floral
scents
mixed
with
straw
although
watery
in
flavor
it
was
not
unpleasant
fizzy
drinking
here
and
goes
down
easy
enough
of
all
the
megabrewed
barley
soda
brands
churned
out
this
one
is
actually
a
little
bit
better
a
little
bit
my
brother
and
father
must
get
something
about
this
brew
that
i
just
dont
gather
gotta
love
family
though
its
the
rest
of
the
population
thats
got
me
mouthing
what
the
still
to
its
credit
its
at
least
a
few
points
better
ontap
not
too
bad
a
little
warm
either
d
about
as
drinkable
a
beer
as
there
is
after
all
its
not
meant
for
one
at
a
time
its
meant
for
twenty
i
cant
completely
beat
up
on
this
brew
after
all
my
wife
and
i
were
both
holding
these
in
our
hands
when
we
met
good
memories
good
times
the
best
mass
produced
american
light
beer
overall
light
and
watery
there
is
not
really
anything
going
on
with
this
i
do
find
their
commercials
funny
but
that
is
the
extent
of
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
though
i
consider
it
among
the
best
of
the
low
calorie
massproduced
american
brews
verdict
the
more
light
lagers
that
i
have
the
less
i
enjoy
them
this
one
is
the
worst
of
them
all
so
far
worse
than
bud
light
believe
it
theres
hardly
any
flavor
in
this
beer
and
whats
there
is
your
predictable
cheap
lager
flavors
corn
and
metallic
grainy
grassy
malt
not
at
all
enjoyable
d
2
drinks
ok
if
youre
at
someone
elses
house
and
theyve
got
nothing
else
otherwise
its
mostly
to
be
avoided
d
you
can
drink
plenty
of
these
with
no
problem
but
it
gives
me
a
hangover
from
hell
the
next
day
poured
a
pale
straw
yellow
lacking
head
of
any
kind
quite
clear
though
the
aroma
is
very
faint
if
any
very
light
corn
and
sweet
grains
but
thats
about
it
the
flavor
is
bland
and
watery
i
drank
a
water
after
this
and
it
wasnt
too
different
fizzy
and
carbonated
at
least
it
has
more
carbonation
than
angels
share
lol
i
poured
the
rest
out
after
making
some
notes
no
i
didnt
quite
finish
my
pint
of
this
and
have
officially
had
my
life
long
fill
of
miller
lite
ontap
or
bottle
if
you
were
stuck
at
a
lame
party
or
already
three
sheets
to
the
wind
i
could
see
this
being
an
easy
beer
to
get
down
sadly
im
sober
right
now
and
im
not
too
stoked
about
finish
my
glass
poure
from
a
can
with
a
paleyellow
thinlooking
body
and
a
hefty
head
which
dwindles
quickly
to
small
lacing
smells
very
thin
not
much
but
metallic
corn
and
some
grain
husk
tastes
very
thin
and
watery
but
what
can
be
tasted
is
not
particularly
pleasing
as
this
beer
warms
up
you
can
really
start
to
smell
and
taste
the
cooked
cornpretty
dreadful
not
a
good
beer
at
allwhy
is
it
so
popular
on
pour
this
had
a
light
golden
color
similar
to
most
of
the
mass
market
light
beers
with
a
head
that
developed
and
disappeared
very
quickly
the
beer
had
a
grainysour
smell
which
began
to
scare
me
the
taste
finished
that
scare
with
little
flavor
besides
water
and
a
waxy
crayon
feel
left
in
my
mouth
it
would
be
drinkable
in
quantity
if
one
could
choke
down
the
the
first
2
however
it
will
take
a
better
man
than
i
to
do
that
note
for
what
it
is
its
ok
dont
get
me
wrong
though
i
would
rather
have
a
real
beer
poured
some
into
a
snifter
some
into
a
tumbler
how
is
this
beer
best
presented
i
cant
tell
you
it
looks
pale
and
watery
barely
registering
a
color
perfect
smells
like
corn
tastes
like
grains
and
corn
a
little
bit
of
grassy
hop
easy
to
drink
not
particularly
enjoyable
at
least
the
entire
can
is
covered
in
trademarks
d
easy
to
down
flavorless
the
riffled
neck
does
not
help
the
multitude
of
reviews
making
snide
comments
on
advertising
campaigns
irritates
me
rate
the
beer
dang
it
i
view
every
beer
with
an
equal
eye
regardless
of
manufacturer
this
is
not
a
good
beer
no
but
for
being
mass
produced
crap
its
not
quite
as
bad
as
all
the
pundits
make
it
out
to
be
what
a
nothing
of
a
beer
briefest
of
heads
immediately
disappeared
very
weak
straw
yellow
virtually
no
flavor
at
all
of
any
kind
the
label
says
great
pilsner
taste
but
it
doesnt
really
taste
of
anything
melted
ice
water
would
be
more
satisfying
and
triple
hops
brewed
but
maybe
by
that
they
just
mean
3
individual
hop
heads
were
added
to
an
enormous
vat
of
beer
just
an
utter
failure
of
a
beer
and
of
course
they
trademarked
the
mispelling
of
lite
which
is
pretty
funny
when
you
consider
how
dumb
that
is
and
how
bad
the
beer
is
pours
from
the
12
oz
can
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
almost
lemonade
color
with
a
foamy
1
12
finger
head
that
settles
into
a
medium
collar
very
active
carbonation
aroma
is
of
wet
grass
cheap
malts
straw
1st
sip
is
like
seltzer
water
with
a
small
amount
of
beer
flavor
all
cheap
grassy
malts
and
where
are
the
triple
hops
that
this
was
allegedly
brewed
with
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
with
tons
of
fizz
to
ensure
that
there
will
be
copious
amounts
of
belching
farting
to
add
to
the
experience
ill
admit
it
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
so
would
a
bottle
of
water
which
if
youre
worried
about
calories
carbs
would
be
a
better
choice
anyway
the
fact
this
is
one
of
the
best
selling
beers
in
america
is
a
true
shining
example
of
what
slick
advertising
can
do
for
a
product
and
to
think
there
was
a
time
when
i
actually
thought
the
swill
was
good
d
sure
i
could
easily
drink
a
6er
of
this
but
why
would
i
want
to
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
mass
marketed
light
beers
way
watered
down
nothing
to
it
not
enjoyable
only
drinkin
this
if
im
playing
some
beer
pong
or
there
is
nothing
else
left
having
said
this
it
is
what
it
is
a
light
american
beer
that
people
like
to
have
a
good
time
with
this
is
fine
but
id
rather
have
a
bud
horses
for
courses
beer
was
purchased
for
my
friend
who
didnt
want
to
drink
any
beer
so
i
decided
to
finally
try
this
pale
straw
yellow
fizzy
carbonation
without
any
real
head
retention
nothing
overly
offensive
in
the
smell
but
it
is
hard
to
get
much
of
anything
this
is
pretty
much
carbonated
water
and
i
suppose
it
could
be
considered
refreshing
but
id
rather
just
drink
water
carbonation
level
is
too
high
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
didnt
finish
on
draught
at
tokyo
grill
victoria
tx
in
22oz
mug
for
2
bucks
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
minimal
white
head
light
aroma
of
corn
grass
taste
same
as
aroma
palate
is
light
body
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
light
grass
and
corn
overall
not
much
aroma
or
flavor
to
speak
of
very
bland
and
boring
could
not
finish
it
it
was
the
one
of
the
better
choices
available
on
the
menu
you
dont
drink
miller
lite
because
of
taste
though
you
drink
it
to
get
drunk
but
not
put
on
too
much
weight
and
in
that
regard
it
works
flavourless
but
drinkable
i
just
had
my
first
miller
lite
in
about
three
years
on
draft
in
a
bar
and
ya
know
what
im
surprised
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
maybe
its
because
ive
been
drinking
nothing
but
pale
ales
and
ipas
lately
but
this
was
downright
refreshing
had
way
more
taste
than
bud
light
or
coors
and
was
nice
to
drink
with
food
i
only
got
it
because
it
was
a
cheap
happy
hour
special
and
dammit
im
glad
i
did
for
what
it
is
and
what
it
aims
to
achieve
id
say
it
succeeds
not
that
its
saying
much
but
this
has
to
be
the
best
light
lager
on
the
market
and
i
rated
it
as
such
on
draught
at
tokyo
grill
in
victoria
tx
pale
straw
color
slightly
darker
than
water
aroma
of
grass
and
corn
thin
carbonated
body
taste
is
like
water
mineral
one
due
to
carbonation
it
was
the
best
available
beer
in
the
japanese
restaurant
well
this
review
wont
be
much
of
a
surprise
but
im
bored
so
ill
write
one
anyways
smells
of
grain
corn
yeast
not
really
much
of
a
smell
at
all
only
if
you
swirl
it
around
or
you
smell
it
as
soon
as
you
pour
it
tastes
like
that
yeasty
grainy
beer
taste
with
that
metallic
tinge
which
i
think
is
the
hops
they
put
such
a
small
amount
that
the
hops
mixing
with
those
grainy
cereal
yeasty
like
flavors
that
it
comes
off
as
a
metallic
taste
even
though
its
really
not
metal
i
get
where
they
are
coming
from
with
this
beer
though
which
is
why
i
didnt
give
it
a
d
or
f
it
really
is
good
if
you
want
to
drink
a
bunch
and
not
get
filled
thats
what
this
beer
is
and
thats
it
the
only
thing
that
they
shouldnt
claim
is
of
course
their
use
of
triple
brew
hopping
if
they
didnt
say
that
and
just
used
the
less
filling
title
then
people
shouldnt
buy
this
beer
and
be
surprised
by
how
it
tastes
ill
drink
it
if
im
real
low
on
money
because
a
24oz
can
of
this
is
only
1
55
notes
like
i
said
better
then
bud
this
used
to
be
what
i
drank
i
cant
believe
the
difference
after
a
couple
years
of
just
drinking
craft
lol
overall
though
good
beer
for
style
very
good
light
adjunct
lager
drinkability
depends
on
who
you
ask
if
you
ask
me
its
not
drinkability
this
isnt
a
d
beer
bud
light
or
coors
light
are
in
the
f
to
d
range
this
beer
is
in
the
c
range
it
is
drinkable
sort
of
refreshing
and
it
cleanses
the
palate
it
also
brings
some
complexity
to
the
style
with
hints
of
hops
and
some
interesting
malts
so
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
just
an
average
beer
when
compared
to
everything
else
as
a
light
lager
this
beer
is
among
the
best
i
dont
agree
with
the
advertising
done
for
this
beer
and
i
dont
like
how
this
beer
is
portrayed
but
it
is
still
a
top
beer
among
light
lagers
d
hey
what
can
you
say
just
about
anyone
can
drink
12
of
these
during
the
course
of
a
night
its
a
classic
american
light
lager
weve
all
had
it
and
i
just
love
it
for
nostaglic
reasons
only
looks
clear
light
golden
with
a
surprisingly
big
white
head
that
settled
into
a
tiny
one
but
didnt
disappear
entirely
and
left
some
lacing
on
its
way
this
beer
smells
like
underarms
feels
watery
and
carbonated
theres
no
taste
to
describe
except
its
less
sweet
than
pbr
that
i
had
right
before
this
one
finish
is
medium
to
dry
goes
down
easy
enough
but
whats
the
point
of
ingesting
alcohol
like
this
im
pretty
lineant
when
it
comes
to
beer
if
some
one
was
to
offer
me
a
free
beer
and
it
was
miller
lite
i
would
not
except
it
this
is
amazing
if
you
know
me
because
i
love
free
drinks
this
beer
is
incredibly
weak
and
whack
its
below
that
of
coors
light
whenever
i
see
some
one
order
a
miller
lite
and
immediatly
judge
that
person
as
weak
no
offense
there
is
practically
no
flavor
and
would
not
at
any
time
buy
this
beer
d
just
like
the
rest
of
the
bmc
beers
they
sacrifice
taste
and
quality
for
volume
cheers
to
tasty
water
ive
always
enjoyed
miller
lite
for
its
easy
drinking
ability
so
im
a
little
bias
it
is
my
favorite
lite
beer
its
a
beer
to
drink
in
mass
amounts
because
you
cant
have
just
one
its
certainly
not
a
beer
thats
complex
by
any
means
it
just
has
a
simple
taste
if
it
had
anymore
taste
complexity
it
wouldnt
be
a
lite
beer
hmm
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
aside
from
the
obvious
i
would
say
that
miller
does
a
lot
of
weird
marketing
ideas
i
e
vortex
bottle
which
this
was
poured
through
what
the
heck
was
the
point
there
guys
or
the
flavor
lock
aluminum
can
screw
top
aluminum
pints
i
mean
really
how
about
working

anyway
now
that
my
rant
is
over
i
would
actually
say
that
i
have
been
sampling
various
miller
products
lately
and
they
have
surprised
me
i
was
surprised
by
the
overly

notes
this
a
very
thin
and
watery
beer
with
grains
as
the
dominate
factor
on
the
taste
which
has
a
little
malt

thats
about
it
very
bland
flavor
the
beer
was
super
thin
in

with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
grainy
watery
and
slight
crisp
finish
the
beer
drinks
very
good
because
its
so
damn
watery
which
makes
for
a
great
session

and
also
a
brew
you
can
have
lots
of
in

hot

day
oh
and
the
only
reason
im

this
style
of
beer
is
for
those
who
really
dont
want
to
taste
their
beer
too
much
they
want
refreshment
and
drinkability
after
work
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
this
beer
delivers
how
can
i
knock
it
or
give
it
too
low
of
a
review
for
delivering
what
most
of
america
and
the
rest
of
the
world
wants
will
i
personal
drink
it
not
much
but
i
know
many
who
do
and
enjoy
it
with
all
their
might

review
ive
heard
people
say
that
some
beers
are
like
drinking
water
but
i
never
understood
it
until
today
this
was
like
drinking
a
very
stale
water
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white

with
some
sticky

left
behind

is

with
some
hops
slight

the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight

note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
out
of
all
the
light
american
beers
i
like
miller
lite
the
most
it
has
a
nice
color
really
smooth
when
ice
cold
its
great
for
tailgating
and
just
hanging
out
with
friends
and
knocking
a
few
back
my
second
choice
would
be
coors
lite
but
i
would
recomend
this
beer
for
anyone
looking
for
a
good
like
domestic
beer
drinkable
sure
but
so
is
water
my
overall
impression
on
this
beer
though
is
not
a
very
good
one
this
was
review
number
666
for
me
which
is
appropriate
because
this
beer
is
in
the
words
of
bobby
bouchers
mom
on
the
waterboy
the

not

while
not
as
good
as
bud
light
in
this
category
miller
light
still
has
good
drinkability
if
they
were
going
for
minimalist
art
and
more
drinkability
because
you
actually
feel
like
you
have
drank
a
beer
after
finishing
one
my
goto
tall
boy
can
at
a

game
chickencoopsep

you
have
had
it
just
remember
cheap
aftertaste
very
light
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
in
honor
of
the
angry
video
game
nerd
rather
than
drinking
this
beer
id
rather
have
a
buffalo
take
a
diarreah
dump
in
my
ear
i
rather
eat
the
rotten
asshole
of
a
roadkill
skunk
and
down
it
with
another
beer
from
the
can
during
a
round
of
golf
but
i
know
all
too
well
what
this
beer
looks
and
smells
like
lets
be
honest
its
not
a
grate
beer
far
from
it
pale
yellow
colored
with
no
body
corny
bland
smell
super
watery
and
lacking
much
taste
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
certainly
goes
down
easy
drinkable
from
the
can
as
long
as
the
can
is
still
cold
once
this
warms
up
a
few
degrees
pitch
it
its
like
drinking
stale
water
well
its
a
light
beer
what
do
you
expect
this
is
the
best
macro
light
in
my
opinion
easy
to
session
if
its
all
youve
got
d
of
all
the
macro
light
lagers
this
one
is
probably
near
the
top
definitely
a
favorite
when
at
the
softball
field
ill
drink
these
in
group
settings
say
with
a
pitcher
thats
about
all
its
good
for
verdict
drink
another
light
beer
the
drinkability
is
about
average
if
you
can
stand
the
taste
not
the
worsttasting
beer
ive
had
that
honor
goes
to
the
flavorless
natty
light
but
certainly
near
the
bottom
d
easy
to
drink
no
harsh
after
taste
and
light
carbonation
make
this
an
easy
beer
to
enjoy
when
looking
for
something
to
drink
and
not
to
satisfy
a
craving
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
sure
its
a
macro
so
its
not
exceptional
but
is
definitely
my
choice
to
take
fishing
or
tailgating
of
course
there
is
better
beer
but
for
an
american
lager
its
one
of
the
elites
much
better
than
bud
light
and
the
silver
bullet
pours
a
golden
color
with
visible
carbonation
and
little
head
the
aroma
is
well
missing
nothing
but
a
musty
water
smell
the
taste
is
of
a
slight
hop
bitterness
yet
with
a
bite
of
skunky
beer
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
not
overly
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
low
you
could
have
one
or
two
and
no
more
it
is
a
simplistic
beer
instead
of
triple
hop
brewing
their
one
hop
they
could
add
some
citrus
notes
or
some
other
more
flavorful
hops
this
is
the
epitome
of
piss
beer
i
absolutely
hate
it
it
is
terrible
from
bottles
cans
and
kegs
while
it
is
a
part
of
many
good
memories
i
wish
i
could
forget
this
beer
it
is
cheap
for
a
reason
i
wont
even
call
it
drinkable
because
i
hate
it
so
much
serving
type
can
light
bodied
with
a
lingering
grainy
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
d
good
for
getting
drunk
honestly
though
not
bad
for
bbqsummertime
i
prefer
this
over
coorslight
and
budlight
but
id
rather
drink
a
nonlight
beer
any
day
overall
i
was
handed
this
shit
at
a
family
party
and
had
to
choke
it
down
no
off
flavors
but
thats
because
there
arent
any
flavors
why
even
bother
i
see
people
buy
this
stuff
by
the
cases
and
it
just
flat
out
baffles
me
i
would
not
have
just
one
though
because
nothing
stands
out
in
this
brew
but
i
think
its
the
best
of
the
empire
light
beers
drinkability
excellent
its
a
run
of
the
mill
beer
not
good
but
not
bad
and
its
really
mild
weak
when
the
bottom
line
is
the
bottom
line
spend
your
money
elsewhere
worth
a
try
if
you
like
a
light
lager
poor
drinkablility
so
boring
a
sweeter
version
of
the
american
adjunct
light
lager
whereas
bud
is
drier
miller
is
a
little
sweeter
with
more
cornhusk
flavors
a
definite
beer
for
long
chugging
sessions
buzz
is
guaranteed
so
is
an
overflowing
bladder
and
numbed
taste
buds
forgotten
nights
discarded
clothing
etc
a
beer
for
long
parties
where
sustainability
is
key
and
drunkeness
is
the
goal
taste
seriously
wtf
are
we
drinking
this
style
for
our
dedication
to
craftmanship
here
cheers
but
thats
pretty
much
what
miller
lite
is
trying
to
be
its
easy
to
find
and
easy
to
drink
as
far
as
light
macros
go
its
probably
the
best
its
certainly
one
of
the
least
offensive
drinkability
easy
drinking
product
but
not
very
good
if
its
cold
it
borderlines
acceptability
for
a
filler
product
not
great
though
taste
it
has
more
flavors
then
some
light
beers
but
i
dont
really
care
for
it
it
is
almost
like
they
tried
really
hard
to
have
it
be
a
more
flavorful
beer
but
the
taste
is
nothing
all
that
great
d
overall
just
a
little
more
color
flavor
and
drinkability
than
other
bmc
light
beers
ever
beer
has
its
time
and
place
and
this
is
a
tolerable
standin
for
times
when
there
are
limited
choices
ball
games
bachelor
parties
etc
i
may
lose
my
membership
for
this
but
in
the
annals
of
how
things
can
taste
miller
lite
really
isnt
that
bad
obviously
its
completely
lacking
in
any
sort
of
character
or
complexity
as
their
ad
once
put
it
its
brewed
in
vats
the
size
of
rhode
island
but
considering
the
style
its
smooth
refreshing
unobjectionable
and
basically
how
id
expect
a
light
beer
to
taste
i
wont
be
running
out
to
buy
it
but
i
wont
turn
it
down
either
poor
finish
and
leaves
a
touch
of
runny
malt
on
the
back
end
too
dry
to
finish
well
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
head
that
has
zero
lacing
smells
like
a
frat
party
ok
ill
give
it
a
little
more
credit
and
say
a
college
bar
on
a
monday
night
with
1
drafts
taste
is
basically
nothing
i
think
i
had
some
corn
stuck
in
my
teeth
though
mouthfeel
is
horrible
not
even
comparable
to
sparkling
water
just
plain
water
drinkability
is
fine
i
guess
if
you
can
drink
water
you
can
drink
miller
lite
this
beer
while
it
didnt
offend
me
or
anything
it
did
nothing
to
impress
me
its
just
kind
of
there
drinkability
it
is
their
catch
phrase
and
i
get
it
in
a
way
this
beer
can
appeal
to
the
masses
and
they
make
no
joke
about
appealing
to
the
lowest
common
demoninator
so
there
you
are
you
could
easily
drink
this
at
a
cookout
you
just
may
not
enjoy
it
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
that
it
was
free
for
a
style
that
is
maybe
falsely
associated
with
drinkability
it
took
me
quite
some
time
to
finish
a
pint
and
i
did
not
want
another
it
is
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
but
i
would
not
spend
money
on
it
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
a
real
beer
not
this
watery
yellow
fizzy
crap
d
sure
you
can
drink
it
probably
a
bunch
of
it
thats
the
point
i
guess
maybe
its
the
conditioning
with
cheep
beer
i
had
but
i
have
to
rate
this
high
on
the
drinkability
chart
because
it
is
drinkable
d
if
i
want
to
keep
up
with
my
partying
college
brothers
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
either
that
or
restraint
and
restraint
always
looses
md
smooth
on
the
tongue
but
a
forced
dry
feel
make
this
kind
of
hard
to
swallow
drinkablity
is
good
for
a
long
night
of
drinking
i
poured
this
abomination
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
white
head
which
immediately
receded
the
color
was
pale
yellow
it
smells
sweet
and
stale
it
tastes
skunky
but
having
had
miller
lite
before
i
know
this
is
how
it
is
supposed
to
taste
it
is
very
watery
high
life
and
mgd
are
better
than
this
crap
the
beer
looks
like
beer
the
body
is
a
darker
yellow
than
a
few
lite
beers
i
have
had
the
head
is
white
and
rocky
however
the
head
quickly
falls
apart
the
aroma
is
of
cooked
grain
and
little
else
the
flavors
are
briefly
sweet
grain
this
gives
way
to
a
metallic
flash
of
flavor
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thin
the
carbonation
is
active
but
fails
to
improve
the
beer
drinkability
uh
no
yet
another
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
why
not
just
drink
water
its
cheaper
drinkability
is
where
this
was
dissapointing
after
a
few
sips
it
reverted
back
to
what
i
was
expecting
bad
tasting
and
hard
to
drink
would
not
of
been
able
to
drink
anymore
i
would
clasify
this
as
a
light
pilsner
tough
call
on
if
this
is
true
to
style
just
a
crappy
one
or
just
a
crappy
beer
age
old
question
i
guess
beer
pong
any
drinking
game
this
beer
is
a
champion
you
may
buy
it
in
any
store
that
sells
booze
and
it
has
less
calories
than
other
regular
light
beers
there
you
have
it
the
best
bad
beer
d
not
as
drinkable
as
its
mainstream
peers
id
much
prefer
coors
for
a
refreshing
light
beer
if
im
buying
cheap
final
thoughts
blah
had
at
dudleys
draw
while
working
on
some
stuff
pours
a
very
pale
yellowgolden
with
a
solid
white
head
the
heads
sticking
around
on
this
guy
but
im
guessing
its
since
it
was
a
rough
pour
off
the
draft
smells
kinda
grainy
a
little
like
straw
not
much
else
on
the
nose
tastes
thin
faint
cornygrain
taste
on
the
finish
but
otherwise
pretty
dry
this
is
better
from
the
bottle
i
do
believe
its
very
inoffensive
and
easy
to
pour
down
my
gullet
though
d
all
beer
has
its
place
i
guess
this
one
would
be
acceptable
not
good
just
acceptable
for
mowing
a
lawn
t
hits
with
carbination
slight
malt
and
finishes
metalic
its
like
diet
pepsi
without
the
aftertaste
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
bmc
light
lagers
i
dont
really
know
why
i
guess
everybody
has
their
preferences
for
this
style
this
is
one
of
mine
of
all
the
mass
produced
american
light
beers
its
my
choice
it
is
what
it
is
if
you
have
a
choice
at
a
party
go
with
miller
lite
it
has
slight
beer
flavour
unlike
keystone
bud
light
busch
light
etc
very
easy
to
drink
in
excess
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
satisfied
if
youre
really
hot
and
thirsty
and
you
dont
care
much
about
flavor
or
if
youre
worried
about
calories
and
you
dont
need
a
satisfying
fullness
this
is
an
okay
beer
it
is
actually
a
rather
typical
american
light
lager
presumably
of
a
pilsener
style
but
not
flavorful
enough
to
be
worthy
of
that
title
the
beer
is
light
colored
with
a
decent
head
it
is
virtually
without
aroma
or
taste
on
the
palate
and
it
certainly
leaves
no
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
the
very
thin
texture
in
the
mouth
is
refreshing
and
crisp
if
youre
thirsty
ill
continue
to
drink
these
at
summer
baseball
games
because
you
have
little
choice
in
most
american
ball
parks
d
less
drinkable
than
bud
light
unfortunately
i
guess
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
it
just
hardly
resembles
beer
all
in
all
it
is
a
lite
beer
and
it
is
what
it
is
that
being
said
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
in
a
pinch
very
light
bodied
high
crisp
carbonation
d
fit
for
college
drinking
games
as
a
lightlyalcoholic
beverage
otherwise
i
wouldnt
touch
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
head
that
dies
pretty
quick
smells
like
stale
pee
the
flavor
is
pretty
unique
ill
give
it
that
kind
of
corn
grain
and
sweet
wheat
no
noticable
hop
flavor
other
than
maybe
a
slight
skunky
floral
sense
in
there
somewhere
no
real
bitterness
at
all
a
crisp
finish
that
leaves
no
flavors
behind
its
carbonated
ok
lots
of
bubbles
to
take
away
the
actual
flavor
once
you
had
a
few
of
these
they
could
start
going
down
real
easy
overall
if
i
rated
this
beer
solely
by
comparison
to
other
light
lagers
of
the
same
class
it
would
be
an
a
so
instead
i
also
considered
its
qualities
as
a
beer
in
general
this
is
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
whisper
i
actually
like
it
quite
well
for
the
number
of
calories
it
has
good
flavor
and
it
seems
to
have
more
body
than
the
others
i
think
i
just
changed
brands
for
my
day
on
the
boat
beer
or
when
i
just
want
something
lighter
drinkability
its
really
high
if
were
neglecting
whether
or
not
drinking
it
is
enjoyable
pass
i
drink
periodically
and
if
the
only
thing
at
a
party
for
a
beer
will
not
drink
bud
light
regardless
very
tiny
head
to
this
high
carbonation
overall
looks
similar
to
sparkling
grape
juice
smells
faintly
metallic
and
sweet
hard
to
distinguish
individual
scents
very
bland
taste
not
offensive
almost
has
a
lager
taste
almost
feels
like
light
champagne
on
the
tongue
can
drink
many
of
these
no
problem
not
my
first
choice
but
i
wont
refuse
it
when
offered
either
king
can
poured
into
imperial
pint
glass
really
dont
remember
this
beer
pouring
so
nice
and
failing
miserably
in
taste
and
feel
thought
id
try
it
for
kicks
while
i
watched
ncaa
and
snacked
on
some
spicy
stuff
looked
clear
golden
yellow
agressive
pour
resulted
in
quite
a
head
decent
tighter
than
alot
of
macros
dont
see
alot
of
carb
action
though
smells
clean
with
a
hint
of
hops
tastes
of
grain
and
the
faintest
of
hops
not
how
i
recalled
from
years
ago
when
this
tasted
distinctly
different
from
other
lights
anyway
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
terrible
flat
in
flavor
and
feel
drinkable
mouthfeel
even
ruined
that
for
me
im
curious
to
try
this
in
other
forms
im
thinking
it
has
to
be
better
on
tap
or
my
sense
of
nostalgia
has
gotten
the
better
of
me
overall
another
crappy
light
beer
dr
cox
should
stick
to
his
day
job
if
anything
its
redoubled
my
resolve
to
find
my
father
a
nice
pilsner
or
something
instead
of
this
junk
d
if
youre
lookin
to
pound
a
few
and
by
that
i
mean
like
20
then
this
is
the
beer
id
choose
its
definitely
better
than
bud
light
as
far
as
this
style
is
concerned
it
used
to
be
my
beer
of
choice
in
college
then
i
tried
real
beer
this
beer
is
o
k
at
best
it
is
a
good
beer
for
drinking
one
after
another
or
free
beer
at
social
outings
that
beer
may
not
be
consumed
fully
or
spilledwasted
another
great
use
for
this
almost
worthless
beer
is
to
use
it
in
such
drinking
games
like
beer
pong
did
drink
it
again
if
there
was
nothing
better
on
hand
verdict
maybe
im
just
not
hip
to
the
hops
but
this
sucks
its
the
normal
thin
and
bland
profile
youd
expect
from
this
style
i
might
even
move
onto
a
craftmicro
brew
of
choice
with
a
similar
golden
light
feeling
but
perhaps
with
some
more
hop
twist
involved

55supposedly
one
of
the
best
beers
for
you
because
of
the
low
carbs
yet
grainy
though
miller
doesnt
need
it
stouts
slight
smell
of
hops
the
taste
is
not
bad
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
a
light
beer
the
smell
is
of
regular
hops
why
bother
im
not
just
being
mean
if
your
just
trying
to
get
hammered
in
conclusion
miller
lite
is
definitely
the
best
tasting
that
point
cannot
be
argued
as
far
as
light
beers
go
yellow
and
offers
little
in
the
way
of
aroma
if
you
are
in
to
light
macro
brews
smells
of
adjuncts
as
usual
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
almost
no
backbone
or
flavor
much
like
drinking
corn
water
it
does
go
down
easily
even
after
the
syrupy
consistency
of
it
fades
into
the
background
certainly
nothing
special
though
its
not
lite

its

beer

american
light

worth
drinking
good
color
miller
lite
is
a
forgettable
brew
that
only
sells
because
of
its
emphasis
on
lower
calories
and
carbs
and
because
of
the
abundance
of
advertising
otherwise
no

seems
to
be
a
little
crisper
out
of
the
keg
but
again
there
really
is
nothing
to
this
brew
thankfully
had
this
one
at
a
local
bar
for
a
nickel
a
pitcher
every
wednesday
night
is
nickel
pitchers
so
i
figured
no
harm
in
trying
it
out
poured
out
a
light
colored
yellow
into
the
plastic
cup
they
gave
me
head
was
pearly
white
but
didnt
stick
around
for
long
lacing
was
little
to
nothing
aroma
was
nonexistant
first
sip
tasted
like
beer
flavored
water
slight
taste
of
corn
husks
and
a
slight
sugar
sweetness
tasted
like
they
added
a
lot
of
water
to
the
tap
on
wednesday
night
not
a
bad
beer
if
youre
paying
5
cents
per
pitcher
finish
was
wet
and
tasteless
enjoy
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
believe
the
bros
should
create
a
new
style
style
category
for
piss
beer
joking
aside
this
beer
is
not
as
horrible
as
bud
lite
or
coors
lite
this
is
far
from
a
compliment
however
as
this
beer
is
still
one
of
the
worst
in
the
world
it
has
the
light
yellow
appearance
that
i
have
come
to
excpect
from
bmc
and
it
just
looks
more
like
urine
than
beer
carbonated
urine
the
smell
is
no
different
than
any
other
light
lager
either
smelling
of
corn
and
grain
the
taste
is
surprisingly
earth
and
grainy
or
at
least
more
so
than
bud
light
and
coors
light
this
beer
is
not
worth
money
when
there
are
so
many
better
options
out
there
but
when
faced
with
the
choice
between
it
and
its
competitors
vote
miller
lite
now
that
i
have
slummed
it
a
bit
its
back
to
my
kapuziner
i
can
think
of
worse
things
to
drink
when
out
at
a
swill
bar
it
is
what
it
is
had
on
tap
at
local
swill
joint
with
little
else
to
offeronly

drinkability
is

to

favorite
12
oz
can
sweet
more
flavorful
than
say

but
not
a
complex
flavor
a
little
corny
best
when
poured
into
a
tall
glass
and
drank
like
water
had
this
at
a
friends
4th
of
july
shindig
after
i
ran
out
of
the
beer
i
brought
i
learned
one
important
lesson
that
day
when
you
bring
good
beer
to
a
house
that
usually
has
shite
beer
they
will
drink
your
good
stuff
first
oh
well
it
pours
a
light
yellow
smells
like
nothing
the
taste
is
boring
and
adjunct
laden
the
best
thing
that
can
be
said
for
this
beer
is
that
it
goes
down
easy
after
you
have
had
several
beers
before
it
it
is
drinkable
because
its
not
like
drinking
much
i
wont
buy
it
but
if
someone
hands
me
one
i
am
not
snobby
enough
to
turn
it
down
a
standard
pale
light
adjunct
lager
nothing
offensive
but
dull
as
could
be
at
the
first
whiff
after
the
cap
comes
off
the
odor
brings
a
common
or
everyday
average
brew
to
your
mind
upon
the
first
sip
you
can
right
off
the
bat
tell
its
a
light
beer
even
if
the
label
is
ripped
off
or
its
on
tap
the
smell
alone
brings
an
average
not
not
be
appealing
to
some
as
the
beer
sits
in
your
mouth
you
can
defiantly
feel
the
carbantion
and
the
freshness
i
give
the
drinkability
something
rare
and
perhaps
good
may
seem
like
an
average
beer
to
some
but
good
to
me
i
suggest
to
drink
it
down
cold
you
can
tell
this
isnt
supposed
to
be
a
specialty
beer
but
defiantly
beats
bud
light
in
the
taste
test
to
my
standerds
yeah
drink
it
cold
from
the
bottle
and
its
ok
as
far
as
light
beers
go
this
one
is
ok
with
its
light
taste
and
body
you
could
drink
a
ton
of
em
which
i
guess
is
millers
point
oh
yeah
the
answers
to
the
questions
posed
above
are
neither
one
cherry
veronica
ml
baseball
can
kiss
my
fed
up
disillusioned
ass
and
wendys
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
good
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
best
of
the
big
three
in
taste
and
drinkablility
its
a
good
session
brew
for
the
price
and
one
hell
of
a
good
fall
back
beer
not
a
brew
for
a
fine
lobster
meal
but
it
gets
the
job
done
after
a
hot
days
work
drinkability
i
bought
this
12pack
thinking
someone
in
our
sand
volleyball
league
liked
it
but
i
was
wrong
imo
its
not
really
a
good
summer
beer
if
you
plan
to
have
it
in
play
for
more
then
ten
minutes
it
gets
nasty
as
soon
as
it
climbs
into
the
upper
40s
in
temp
perhaps
it
was
the
inspiration
for
beer
funneling
better
as
a
winter
party
beer
a
football
game
when
its
nice
and
cold
outside
ice
fishing
intramural
curling
leagues
those
kinds
of
things
had
this
with
pizza
as
bud
lite
was
also
served
and
i
thought
id
see
if
there
was
any
difference
it
poured
a
clear
strawlike
yellowgold
with
a
fair
oneinch
white
head
carbonation
is
up
so
some
fizz
aids
in
taking
the
head
to
a
very
thin
film
if
at
all
lace
is
in
small
spots
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
grain
canlike
not
sweet
the
taste
is
also
grain
semi
sweet
corn
with
a
citric
hop
note
that
pretty
faint
the
mouthfeel
is
left
with
a
dry
metal
feel
again
perhaps
the
can
drinkability
was
just
ok
nothing
ill
turn
down
if
offered
and
its
priced
reasonable
not
one
id
keep
in
my
home
stock
as
for
the
bud
lite
i
thought
miller
did
a
better
job
the
appearance
is
not
as
watery
the
head
shows
up
and
you
get
some
citric
taste
backed
by
the
corn
whereas
ab
tends
to
skunk
it
up
abit
a
true
pilsner
beer
ha
ok
perhaps
ng
drinkabilty
this
is
may
be
the
most
drinkable
macro
out
there
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
it
was
fairly
refreshing
and
would
make
a
descent
lawnmower
beer
but
why
pick
this
for
lawnmowing
with
so
many
more
tasteful
choices
out
there
on
tasting
the
only
thing
i
could
pick
up
at
first
was
the
deadening
cold
and
the
intense
carbonation
stinging
my
taste
buds
when
i
recovered
i
could
start
to
sense
some
light
malt
this
too
was
ephemeral
bitterness
was
minmal
to
mild
body
was
light
but
not
completely
watery
not
impressed
overall
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
hint
of
aroma
and
malt
probaly
the
darkest
color
light
beers
amongst
the
macros
could
literally
not
distinguish
a
molecule
of
arom
it
seemed
highly
charged
with
carbonation
there
actually
was
some
substance
to
the
taste
detected
a
corn
malt
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
aftertaste
besides
sam
adams
its
probaly
the
fullest
and
tastiest
of
the
lights
but
so
what
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
for
a
light
beer
that
is
it
has
a
light
malt
scent
with
little
or
no
hops
the
is
a
small
amount
of
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
watered
down
malt
flavor
with
a
bitter
skunky
finish
it
refreshes
on
the
way
down
but
this
beer
is
for
amatuers
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
lots
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
about
average
as
far
as
these
types
of
beers
go
it
one
and
done
for
me
i
prefer
michelob
light
to
this
in
all
not
much
can
be
said
about
miller
lite
that
hasnt
already
be
stressed
in
detail
by
other
more
concise
reviews
but
accept
miller
lite
as
it
is
this
beer
will
be
around
for
decades
i
guarantee
it
drinkable
it
is
not
great
but
it
beats
everything
i
have
tasted
except
sam
adams
light
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
once
again
i
put
my
faith
in
believing
all
the
hype
but
turns
out
its
just
another
light
macro
its
too
watered
down
in
fact
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
before
i
hda
an
amste
light
and
my
amstel
light
almost
tasted
like
the
most
flavrofilled
beer
in
the
world
just
a
regular
light
beer
bland
and
simple
to
the
taste
miller
lite
is
probably
the
best
of
the
lite
beers
but
that
is
not
saying
much
the
appearance
is
a
straw
yellow
with
a
smell
sorta
fruity
the
taste
is
not
bad
actually
tastes
like
apricot
sort
of
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
on
a
hot
sticky
summer
day
not
bad
as
far
as
the
cheap
beers
are
concerned
this
is
my
favorite
budmillercoors
product
however
it
is
not
a
sipping
beer
it
is
a
beer
that
i
dont
mind
drinking
when
someone
offers
it
to
me
at
their
home
the
beer
is
yellow
and
has
not
head
it
is
light
in
taste
with
a
light
hop
character
that
is
detectable
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
it
is
light
refreshing
and
drinkable
not
a
good
beer
really
by
any
means
but
as
far
as
the
mass
produced
american
lite
beer
goes
it
isnt
bad
has
some
flavor
underneath
all
the
water
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
drink
often
but
when
you
want
to
kickback
and
watch
a
game
and
have
something
to
drink
without
getting
smashed
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
i
sat
and
watched
a
game
and
just
kept
kicking
them
back
like
it
was
water
which
it
mostly
is
but
in
the
end
i
would
take
this
over
the
other
lite
beers
i
guess
out
of
the
macro
light
lagers
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
but
that
is
not
saying
much
at
all
it
poured
the
typical
clearstraw
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
quickly
faded
into
nothing
the
smell
was
of
grain
and
a
slight
malt
scent
as
well
the
taste
was
grain
then
a
nasty
sweetness
that
tried
to
cover
up
the
brews
nastyness
but
instead
just
added
to
it
i
dont
know
why
any
sane
person
would
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
not
drinkable
but
not
a
total
drainpour
umm
how
do
i
really
go
about
revieing
thes
brew
light
straw
pout
not
to
much
taste
but
has
a
very
slight
mix
of
ricecornhop
presence
to
it
its
watery
flavor
give
it
drinkablity
level
a
nice
boost
this
by
no
means
is
a
brew
of
choice
but
give
it
to
your
nonba
buddies
they
may
by
some
unfortnae
chance
thank
you
for
it
best
with
a
burger
and
fries
cheers
there
are
worse
beers
out
there
scores
remain
the
same
as
do
my
opinions
for
a
light
beer
it
has
a
nice
little
hit
of
maltiness
and
some
subtle
hop
flavors
in
relation
to
other
light
beers
one
of
the
better
light
beers
out
there
considerably
better
than
bud
light
ok
its
a
light
beer
and
thats
the
bottom
line
here
you
can
drink
dozens
but
my
point
is
why
to
get
drunk
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
why
i
would
have
another
short
of
my
brother
pleading
me
to
have
one
with
him
and
even
then
hed
have
to
sound
as
pathetic
as
he
did
last
night
this
is
a
solid
nogo
for
me
though
i
suppose
the
drinkability
will
lead
some
to
senseless
abuse
this
was
a
lot
better
than
served
on
tap
it
was
a
little
warmer
i
think
still
has
a
very
weak
flavor
that
is
dominated
by
a
grain
taste
still
very
boring
drinking
it
out
of
the
bottle
makes
you
miss
the
lack
of
a
decent
head
gimme
a
full
flavor
beer
instead
of
this
stuff
anytime
probably
the
best
light
beer
of
the
big
3
though
thats
not
saying
a
lot
i
had
to
trade
a
prima
pils
in
order
to
get
this
review
so
i
definitely
lost
out
that
aside
i
have
this
review
so
i
dont
have
to
have
another
ever
again
what
is
worse
than
miller
light
from
a
bottle
how
about
lite
from
a
can
this
is
a
clearish
yellowy
liquid
with
a
small
spritzy
head
the
aromas
are
of
stale
grains
and
seltzer
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
nothing
good
going
on
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
worse
in
the
can
than
it
is
in
the
bottle
and
in
fact
the
taste
is
worse
as
well
of
course
the
drinkability
is
utter
crap
too
why
precisely
am
i
reviewing
this
piss
yellow
with
a
minimal
head
not
much
of
an
aroma
taste
is
fairly
grassy
with
a
little
wheat
a
little
malty
sweetness
virtually
no
aftertaste
extremely
light
bodied
might
as
well
be
drinking
soda
water
probably
one
of
the
better
light
beers
but
thats
not
saying
much
this
beer
is
nothing
great
but
its
not
too
bad
either
drinkability
i
had
this
out
of
solidarity
with
my
family
but
only
because
the
hopdevil
and
yuengling
hadnt
been
chilled
yet
drinkability
i
know
people
like
to
shun
these
beers
as
crap
because
they
think
it
has
to
be
a
50
case
of
beer
to
show
that
they
have
such
a
sophisticated
palate
well
poindexter
this
beer
is
about
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
go
to
a
game
a
company
outing
or
your
buddys
garage
and
this
beer
will
most
likely
be
in
attendance
it
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
no
it
wont
impress
anyone
but
yes
it
is
a
halfway
decent
beer
so
deal
with
it
i
feel
eminently
qualified
to
review
this
macro
miller
lite
having
consumed
mass
quantities
of
same
over
the
past
twenty
years
as
my
canadian
friends
would
say
this
isnt
really
beer
it
has
no
real
taste
or
mentionable
characteristics
i
can
assure
you
that
you
will
get
a
pronounced
buzz
after
quaffing
10
or
more
at
least
its
not
as
watery
as
most
of
its
american
competitors
and
is
rarely
skunky
not
much
else
to
say
about
it
i
feel
a
little
ashamed
that
i
didnt
just
hate
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
offensive
so
it
cant
score
too
low
plus
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
it
did
have
a
nice
gold
color
instead
of
the
thin
yellow
stuff
i
was
expecting
and
it
had
a
head
that
didnt
instantly
fizz
away
the
flavor
wasnt
much
mostly
an
interesting
applely
flavor
when
really
cold
then
joined
by
a
faint
huskiness
a
little
later
on
oh
man
this
isnt
even
good
for
a
light
beer
the
extra
sweetness
fails
miserably
when
it
attempts
ot
cover
up
the
chemical
aftertaste
think
ill
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
backdated
tasting
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
on
30aug03
this
post
is
based
on
notes
from
that
review
ahhh
one
of
americas
most
popular
beers
donated
by
a
friend
making
it
drinkable
when
the
case
is
fresh
and
youre
just
chilling
with
the
homies
watching
a
game
i
actually
dont
mind
it
nomadoct

vague
confectioners

but
not
even
a
sense

carbonation

but

strongly
near
the
close
obviously
poor
mouthfeel

didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
it
was
watery
like
most
other
lite
beers
i
have
had
definitely
nothing
much
to
this
beer
if
i
am
going
to
have
a
light
beer
from
any
of
the
macros
i
would
pass
this
up
and
go
to
a
bud
light
even
though
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
yellow
stuff
i
once
heard
a
friend
of
mine
from
the
united
kingdom
say
that
american
beer
is
for
children
little
or
no

terribly

5its
time
to
review
one
of
the
lesser
lights
of
the
beer
world
please
forgive
this
atrocious
pun
medium
gold
color
with
a
decent
snowwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
paperthin
layer
in
moments
well
carbonated
thus
quite
a
bit
of
foaming
the
carbonation
doesnt
help
to
give
any
mouthfeel
the
dummies
in
the
next
building
over
were
making
steaks
and
offered
me
one
of
these
to
go
with
it
its
not
as
bad
as
i
had
convinced
myself
it
was
clear
yellow
color
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
smell
was
really
bitter
and
metallic
taste
was
mostly
bitter
some
beerness
to
it
but
had
a
really
thin
watery
finish
and
a
sour
aftertaste
light
thin
and
easy
to
drink
the
first
23
ounces
when
cold
are
pleasant
and
tolerable
i
see
why
people
drink
these
fast
the
longer
it
sits
after
5
minutes
the
harsher
it
gets
i
knew
the
day
would
come
so
i
might
as
well
start
getting
the
macros
out
of
the
way
of
the
2
or
3
beers
that
i
will
not
drink
this
is
one
of
them
i
was
fully
prepared
to
leave
when
friends
forced
me
to
stay
and
offered
me
one
of
these
the
forced
air
carbonation
gave
a
large
fluffy
head
and
the
smell
was
bitter
but
not
quite
a
hops
type
bitterness
the
color
was
a
very
light
golden
and
the
taste
was
nonexistent
side
note
undrinkable
out
of
the
can
of
the
megabrewers
this
has
to
be
the
light
beer
that
makes
the
worst
impression
on
me
granted
all
arent
a
good
color
or
smell
but
the
taste
of
this
one
is
just
rather
odd
well
this
is
a
vapid
barely
concealed
mockery
of
beerdom
its
nothing
i
couldnt
take
the
ratings
even
down
to
1
because
it
lacks
enough
personality
to
be
awful
barely
any
aroma
only
the
slightest
hint
of
color
and
the
taste
is
so
watered
down
so
as
to
make
the
carbonation
dominate
any
possible
flavor
another
beer
i
had
at
a
good
friends
bday
party
fortunately
i
had
some
good
stuff
in
reserve
that
i
had
to
break
out
i
am
sure
i
converted
some
people
after
the
horrible
duo
of
this
and
coors
light
rating

when
i
am
out
with
friends
on
the
weekends
and
i
am
thirsty
but
i
dont
want
a
beer
this
is
what
i
drink
sometimes
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
a
grain
flavored
weakalcoholic
soda
pop
it
is
not
a
pilsner
or
any
beer
for
that
matter
if
you
enjoy
miller
lite
im
with
you
on
thatno
offense
intended
but
lets
be
honest
light
beers
basically
all
the
same
this
one
however
is
not
too
bad
on
tap
i
get
it
every
now
and
then
because
it
is
easy
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
them
and
the
23
ounce
pilsner
is
really
really
cheap
at
the
bar
absolutely
no
body
very
little
taste
but
most
important
those
grainy
aftertastes
you
see
with
every
other
macro
are
subdued
to
the
point
where
i
didnt
even
notice
them
the
best
light
beer
of
the
big
three
12
oz
bottle
very
pale
yellow
color
extreamly
carbonated
but
bubbles
are
largesign
of
forced
carbonation
to
the
max
no
smell
to
write
about
slight
malt
flavor
no
bitterness
at
all
lacks
any
sign
of
hops
slight
skunk
taste
finish
a
very
watery
beer
this
is
the
beer
that
started
the
light
beer
craze
back
in
the
70s
and
well
things
havent
been
quite
the
same
since
have
they
my
father
drinks
this
and
only
this
it
doesnt
have
alot
of
taste
and
of
course
its
watery
but
its
not
horrible
on
a
hot
day
it
will
quench
your
thirst
if
you
are
going
for
flavor
then
this
isnt
what
you
want
to
drink
darker
than
most
bright
lagers
but
does
that
count
for
anything
a
swill
beer
that
can
be
drank
endlessly
without
fear
of
getting
sick
i
hate
that
adjunct
taste
and
smell
and
its
so
fizzy
and
metallic
ugh
a
true
pilsener
what
ok
that
all
said
when
youre
stuck
in
the
desert
and
you
have
to
choose
between
this
and
coors
light
you
pick
this
again
no
idea
of
the
color
as
i
never
saw
it
on
the
way
from
the
can
to
my
piehole
definitely
more
beerlike
than
tha
bullet
with
less
of
an
offgrainy
taste
ill
agree
with
a
previous
reviewer
about
a
nuttiness
to
the
flavor
may
have
briefly
detected
a
hop
in
there
somewhere
as
well
not
a
bad
pull
if
youre
at
a
party
with
a
big
ol
cooler
full
of
mixed
cans
of
heavily
advertised
beer
as
far
as
mass
produced
american
lagers
go
this
one
is
probably
a
little
better
than
the
others
it
is
almost
transparent
smells
of
nothing
tastes
of
nothing
with
a
slight
hop
taste
that
last
for
about
1
second
this
is
its
edge
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
the
beer
is
too
carbonated
to
be
very
drinkable
good
to
get
a
keg
of
for
all
your
friends
who
dont
like
beer
when
you
have
a
party
watered
down
look
and
watered
down
skunk
taste
ok
here
we
go
i
wasnt
going
to
do
this
but
i
cant
help
it
this
is
what
millers
rd
team
manager
said
at
the
last
meeting
before
they
produced
miller
lite
lets
get
some
bad
tasting
water
and
really
screw
it
up
put
it
in
a
can
market
the
mess
out
of
it
because
we
know
this
works
see
coors
light
and
well
sell
it
and
tell
people
they
like
it
then
by
the
time
they
figure
out
this
isnt
really
beer
at
all
well
all
be
rich
enough
said
this
the
usual
light
brewski
same
as
the
rest
one
of
the
better
light
beers
out
there
for
sure
if
you
are
a
stickiler
to
styles
light
bodied
thin
lace
and
minimal
head
retention
lots
of
corn
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
finishes
pretty
damn
dry
more
or
less
a
sad
excuse
for
beer
not
sure
which
is
worse
synthetic
hops
or
rough
grainy
malt
mmm
slumming
this
is
something
youd
decline
even
if
it
was
free
notes
as
far
as
lite
beers
go
its
not
horrible
but
it
is
still
a
lite
beer
why
bother
drinking
this
on
a
normal
basis
overall
i
will
give
miller
chill
miller
brewing
co
a
3
25
it
was
better
than
i
had
anticipated
overall
less
of
a
beer
really
so
much
as
a
low
alcohol
spritzer
certainly
not
my
type
of
beer
nor
my
favourite
but
i
think
this
would
be
decent
for
those
that
would
normally
drink
a
shandy
or
a
sweet
readytodrink
as
a
guy
that
likes
all
beer
and
will
give
it
all
a
go
this
stuff
is
ok
kind
of
like
bud
light
lime
not
bad
overall
refreshing
light
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
pretty
good
for
the
style
final

a
c
miller
chill
is
fine
for
what
it
is
a
massproduced
limeflavoured
light
lager
this
style
of
beer
has
never
been
my
bag
but
i
am
willing
to
grant
that
this
is
a
surprisingly
tolerable
example
and
i
will
have
no
trouble
finishing
the
other
5
bottles
i
like
this
more
than
bud
light
lime
although
to
be
fair
i
havent
actually
had
any
of
that
stuff
in
at
least
3
years
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
again
but
id
have
no
problem
drinking
one
if
offered
and
anyone
in
the
market
for
a
tolerable
light
beer
should
give
this
one
a
look
would
not
purchase
or
drink
again
this
beer
was
a
real
good
beer
you
can
taste
the
lime
in
the
beer
it
is
smooth
and
it
is
not
too
strong
of
a
taste
the
lime
taste
i
think
is
a
really
good
taste
with
this
beer
i
have
only
had
it
in
a
bottle
but
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
if
i
could
find
a
bar
with
it

there

to

the

that
is
about
it
it
really
dose
not
smell

the
taste
is
lime
and
some
other
flavor
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
this
brew
is
not
bad
but
not
good
either
it
is

dont
believe
i
ever
had
one
of
these
chilled
down
to
36
degrees
in
my
beer
cooler
and
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
pale
strawyellow
in
color
with
about
a
2finger
white
foamy
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
not
much
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
were
seen
raising
form
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
grains
probably
corn
and
lime
the
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
very
light
body
and
on
the
waterdown
side
guess
that
would
account
for
the
lover
alcohol
content
overall
it
was
ok
nothing
special
but
different
i
wont
knock
this
to
death
because
it
is
better
than
bud
light
lime
and
much
better
than
big
rock
lime
still
its
a
below
average
attempt
at
a
light
lime
lager
if
you
can
find
moosehead
light
lime
get
that
over
this
youll
be
thankful
a
poorly
made
beer
the
citrus
does
not
marry
well
with
the
lager
underneath
grainy
salty
its
a
bit
tough
to
put
down
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
in
this
category
steer
towards
bud
light
lime
it
is
a
much
better
crafted
beer
that
drinks
much
more
easily
eh
i
was
refreshing
but
otherwise
unremarkable
o
it
was
a
pretty
boring
and
bland
experience
wasnt
horrible
but
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
again
if
someone
really
insisted
on
me
drinking
one
id
do
it
but
wouldnt
really
enjoy
it
o
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
i
want
something
cheap
available
at
the
gas
station
on
the
way
and
easy
to
drink
at
the
beach
or
park
in
the
summer
if
you
recognize
it
for
what
its
meant
to
be
a
light
lager
with
flavoring
thats
packaged
for
convenience
and
brewed
for
refreshment
not
taste
its
decent
if
fruit
in
your
beer
is
your
thing
then
this
isnt
so
bad
it
tastes
artificial
like
a
less
sweet
version
of
powdered
koolaid
it
didnt
give
me
indigestion
like
bud
light
lime
did
i
will
admit
that
this
is
a
pretty
refreshing
extremely
light
beer
good
for
a
really
hot
day
but
not
much
else
overall
im
not
a
person
that
cares
for
fruit
flavors
added
to
my
beer
that
being
said
as
a
light
lager
this
isnt
bad
but
there
are
better
choices
out
there
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
transparent
straw
color
with
an
initial
white
head
of
about
1
5
fingers
but
it
is
gone
very
quickly
smells
only
of
artificial
lime
flavoring
tastes
of
adjunct
light
beer
with
lime
flavoring
added
carbonation
a
little
heavy
but
to
be
expected
for
a
light
adjunct
beer
however
extremely
drinkable
and
could
throw
many
of
these
without
noticing
overall
definitely
a
below
average
beer
but
more
tolerable
than
most
light
lagers
appearance
is
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
crisp
but
easily
dissipating
head
smell
is
faint
of
lime
and
adjuncts
taste
is
also
light
with
the
lime
and
adjuncts
with
sparse
hops
leaving
a
minor
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
with
crisp
carbonation
i
suspect
it
could
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
way
too
much
carbonation
and
the
body
is
pretty
watery
o
i
suppose
if
i
compare
this
beer
to
something
like
bud
light
lime
it
is
decent
on
the
other
hand
if
i
compare
it
to
anything
else
then
it
is
seriously
lacking
in
the
end
miller
chill
is
pretty
awful
something
to
be
avoided
the
added
lime
does
bring
some
much
needed
character
to
the
flavor
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
its
refreshing
for
the
summer
but
thats
it
better
than
the
lemon
version
o
actually
could
have
been
worse
not
by
much
but
it
could
have
overall
this
is
a
pretty
watery
beer
its
definitely
drinkable
but
theres
nothing
good
to
say
about
it
i
would
only
drink
it
if
it
was
free
o
just
a
bad
all
around
beer
i
knew
i
wouldnt
like
it
but
boy
is
this
just
a
terrible
beer
life
is
too
short
to
waste
time
drinking
lackluster
beer
rjt
d
take
everything
you
thought
you
knew
about
macrolagers
and
add
some
gross
artificial
fruit
flavor
yuck
not
the
worst
thing
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
for
fans
of
beers
with
you
know
somewhat
of
a
taste
to
them
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
decent
carbonation
and
bright
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
smell
is
of
lime
and
grass
the
taste
just
doesnt
work
the
lime
tastes
weird
and
the
only
good
thing
about
it
is
that
its
refreshing
very
light
body
and
decent
carbonation
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
slightly
better
than
but
light
lime
but
still
not
something
i
will
ever
buy
again
overall
drinkability
decent
for
the
style
might
be
a
little
better
than
bud
light
lime
but
theyre
both
such
bad
beers
in
general
its
not
worth
splitting
hairs
over
there
really
isnt
anything
too
beery
about
this
beer
no
real
malt
profile
no
hop
presence
it
pretty
much
fails
as
a
beer
and
supposedly
miller
has
toyed
with
the
recipe
since
its
rival
bud
lime
seems
to
be
fairing
better
in
sales
from
various
sources
ive
read
i
guess
this
is
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
definitely
more
exciting
choices
out
there
for
hotweather
brews
i
dont
know
why
bother
you
shouldnt
in
these
days
of
flavorful
chewy
rich
high
hopped
and
malted
microwbrews
such
liquids
as
miller
chill
seem
to
have
no
purpose
anymore
looking
as
light
as
carbonated
soda
water
with
a
nonexistent
smell
and
almost
nonexistent
taste
you
might
as
well
place
an
order
for
limeflavored
alka
selter
soda
water
pabst
blue
ribbon
has
more
definitive
flavor
bud
light
more
hops
seagrams
malt
beveridge
at
least
has
flavor
the
slightly
metallic
wheatiness
of
this
highly
carbonated
liquid
was
so
distant
from
the
ideal
i
wonder
it
could
even
be
called
beer
even
in
the
world
of
summer
and
light
beers
id
say
this
was
low
in
its
category
and
i
wouldnt
even
give
it
the
purposeful
quality
of
thirst
quenching
quaffable
bring
on
the
genuine
ginger
ale
or
simply
bring
me
a
soda
pop
please
this
was
not
a
pleasant
experience
i
think
that
miller
tried
to
hard
and
put
in
little
effort
to
change
the
miller
style
into
a
beer
that
is
far
below
quality
and
what
i
believe
they
could
be
capable
of
it
looks
like
a
light
beer
but
taste
worse
almost
like
sun
warmed
water
that
was
later
chilled
and
then
a
warm
lime
added
i
actually
like
the
concept
of
this
beer
but
nothing
after
that
plain
ol
jane
gold
in
color
with
a
beigeish
1
finger
head
a
boring
mouth
feel
with
a
lingering
after
taste
just
all
in
all
a
poor
quality
product
pours
pale
straw
yellow
under
a
very
shortlived
head
a
hint
of
lime
in
the
aroma
and
taste
alongside
the
merest
hint
of
anything
remotely
beerish
to
be
enjoyed
in
context
done
this
one
movin
on
i
am
amazed
at
so
many
words
people
have
put
into
reviews
to
describe
this
its
a
terrible
lite
beer
with
a
sticky
syrupy
lime
taste
that
is
clearly
more
artificial
then
a
coke
not
at
one
point
when
drinking
it
did
any
flavor
hit
me
that
would
remind
me
of
anything
thatd
register
as
beer
avoid
forever
if
you
have
ever
tasted
self
respect
and
enjoyed
it
there
is
no
redemption
for
this
beer
salt
and
beer
is
something
thats
as
bad
as
it
sounds
putting
lime
in
bud
light
would
be
a
hundred
times
better
then
this
avoid
almost
no
head
weak
gold
body
aroma
of
fake
lime
and
grass
taste
is
sour
lime
pop
with
a
cardboard
beer
finish
then
a
cloying
rice
sweetness
i
would
rather
drink
a
bud
light
lime
than
this
but
that
is
really
not
saying
too
much
would
not
recommend
this
to
anybody
i
like
the
idea
of
creating
something
the
will
refresh
a
person
in
the
summer
time
however
adding
lime
to
a
pale
lager
isnt
always
the
answer
i
guess
that
miller
did
a
lot
of
spying
on
corona
extra
and
found
out
that
the
lime
might
help
them
compete
with
the
corona
drinker
im
not
partial
to
either
one
really
so
for
me
to
say
it
was
a
good
choice
would
be
a
bias
this
beer
tastes
much
like
sprite
or
7up
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
this
beer
it
is
too
sweet
for
my
liking
this
pours
a
light
and
pale
yellow
overly
carbonated
with
a
slight
bright
white
head
the
smell
is
of
fake
lime
juice
and
miller
lite
how
creative
oh
man
possibly
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
i
dont
know
why
theyd
attempt
this
it
drinks
light
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
leaves
too
much
of
the
fake
lime
flavor
behind
this
beer
is
offensively
bad
its
hard
to
look
at
let
alone
drink
it
reminds
me
of
when
this
first
came
out
during
my
sophomore
year
in
college
the
miller
lite
girls
were
at
the
liquor
store
and
having
a
tasting
they
gave
my
roommate
a
free
case
we
ended
up
having
a
party
that
night
and
we
couldnt
give
the
bottles
away
no
one
wanted
to
touch
it
for
a
reason
if
you
like
lime
in
your
beer
then
i
guess
this
is
a
beer
for
you
if
not
just
give
it
a
try
to
say
you
at
least
tried
it
d
this
is
just
awful
normally
i
can
stand
a
bad
light
lager
but
the
addition
of
lime
flavoring
to
this
just
made
it
even
worse
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
fresh
but
why
bother
the
poor
tastesmellmouthfeel
keeps
that
from
amounting
to
anything
d
on
a
summer
day
i
wouldnt
have
a
big
problem
grabbing
one
of
these
at
a
tailgate
or
something
but
its
a
pretty
lame
beer
otherwise
d
fizzy
water
with
lime
pretty
gross
for
some
new
years
eve
afternoon
entertainment
beerfms
andy
i
decided
to
open
this
bottle
that
had
been
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
since
july
may
31
on
the
bottle
pours
a
flat
light
green
which
fizzled
out
quickly
aroma
taste
very
synthetic
a
la
lime
pledge
or
pinesol
not
terrible
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
certainly
not
something
the
d
train
would
pull
out
of
the
station
to
get
on
my
own
d
overall
i
prefer
this
one
to
big
rocks
attempt
at
a
lime
beer
but
the
synthetic
lime
is
a
little
too
much
for
my
liking
if
you
want
lime
in
your
beer
i
suggest
you
get
yourself
a
real
lime
and
go
from
there
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
watery
and
overly
carbonated
truly
terrible
i
was
nearly
sick
watching
others
at
the
beer
drink
this
crap
up
yuck
pours
a
light
clear
straw
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
and
no
lacing
smells
like
creamed
corn
with
lemon
juice
tastes
like
sweet
corn
with
a
twist
of
that
fake
lemon
juice
from
the
packets
at
cheap
ass
restaurants
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
bubbly
half
decent
drinkability
drinkability
the
fresher
taste
that
the
lemon
taste
adds
makes
this
light
beer
more
tolerable
but
still
not
at
all
complex
enough
to
make
it
very
interesting
d
blech
the
flavor
is
just
too
sickly
sweet
and
artificial
to
be
enjoyable
overall
have
i
said
that
it
tastes
like
sugary
lime
juice
for
me
drinkable
i
love
lime
but
no
real
beer
flavors
i
could
drink
a
12
pack
of
these
no
problem
but
postcollege
i
dont
really
see
a
situation
where
i
would
want
too
tastes
like
sugar
thats
really
all
i
get
in
the
mouthfeel
sugar
and
water
if
thats
what
youre
into
check
it
out
pale
straw
in
colour
with
loads
of
visible
carbonation
fluffy
white
head
quickly
fizzles
away
leaving
a
thin
cap
of
bubbles
behind
some
lacing
smells
like
lime
flavoured
carbonated
water
tastes
like
lime
flavoured
carbonated
water
its
even
less
beery
than
the
bud
light
lime
if
you
can
believe
it
and
the
lime
isnt
quite
as
intense
either
thin
and
spritzy
though
not
as
aggressively
bubbly
as
bl
lime
would
you
be
surprised
if
i
told
you
it
drank
like
lime
flavoured
carbonated
water
the
lime
flavoured
carbonated
water
is
so
much
cheaper
though
why
am
i
even
reviewing
this
i
dont
know
a
friend
offered
me
this
after
basketball
it
was
cold
and
i
thought
id
take
a
chance
since
a
lime
beer
sounded
refreshing
it
was
a
pale
yellow
some
head
that
dissipated
quickly
with
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
smells
mildly
of
lime
and
i
dont
get
much
else
taste
is
almost
like
carbonated
water
with
a
little
bit
of
lime
not
much
lime
though
which
disappointed
me
i
would
have
been
happier
with
carbonated
water
with
some
lime
juice
this
wasnt
as
bad
as
it
was
nothingness
d
ill
let
this
and
bud
light
lime
fight
it

super
light

also
dominated

as
i
had
expected
just
quite
bland

yellow

with
alot
of
fizz
but
little
head
smelled
mainly
of
lime
with
a
bit
of
raw
adjunct
corn
tasted
like
a
bad
wobbly
pop
i
think
this
was
meant
as
a
vodka
cooler
but
they
added
something
resembling
beer
by
accident
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
and
very
gassy
will
definitely
make
you
bloat
drinkable
well
its
bad
but
its
not
terrible
its
a
decent
party
drink
to
serve
women
seemed
to
especially
love
it
as
for
myself
id
never
order
it
but
if
given
to
me
id
take
it
its
not
horrible
just
dull
overall
not
nearly
as
good
as
bud
light
lime
or
chopping
up
your
own
lime
not
sure
why
i
bother
reviewing
these
horrable
macros
guess
thats
what
happens
when
your
bored
at
your
inlaws
for
getting
smashed
only
interesting
to
see
a
bmc
product
on
canadian
shelves
these
days
thats
actually
made
in
its
yankee
homeland
and
not
contract
brewed
on
this
side
of
the
border
in
this
case
however
miller
chills
plainly
pandering
and
generally
offensive
nature
has
me
tempted
to
decry
american
hegemony
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with

hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is

sweet
malty
slight

note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
notes
not
a
fan
of
the
lime
flavor
too
sweet
and
off
tasting
others
may
like
it
and
think
it
slightly
improves
the
macro
lager
but
i
think
it
makes
it
worse
cheers
nice
graphics
on
the
bottle
i
still
love
the
conan
skit
with
max
the
drummer
doing
a
miller
chill
commercial
in
japan
classic
the
beer
has
a
fine
appearance
decent
body
and
good
carbonation
the
taste
however
is
far
from
my
liking
if
i
wanted
a
hint
of
lime
in
a
beer
i
would
order
a
corona
at
mexican
restaurant
how
could
this
possible
have
a
large
market
sometimes
when
im
reviewing
a
macro
i
wonder
if
i
would
rate
it
better
if
it
had
a
micro
label
on
it
in
miller
chills
case
i
dont
really
have
that
reservation
with
that
said
i
could
see
this
as
a
decent
drink
on
a
hot
day
if
it
were
ice
cold
in
fact
never
drink
this
thing
anytime
of
year
unless
it
is
frigid
d
i
took
while
walking
in
the
sun
and
i
got
very
thirsty
when
i
finished
it
overall
meh
i
would
only
drink
this
again
if
it
was
free
or
if
i
was
parched
on
a
summer
day
poured
from
a
clear
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
notes
of
lime
taste
is
rather
weak
some
flavoring
of
limes
not
much
else
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
this
probably
should
have
been
classified
as
a
light
lager
overall
nothing
special
about
this
one
d
this
beer
made
me
think
prohibition
was
a
good
idea
i
cant
say
that
there
was
anything
good
about
this
beer
except
that
i
didnt
pay
for
it
overall
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
the
best
part
there
isnt
much
flavor
so
you
could
drink
these
for
a
while
just
tried
them
cuz
they
had
a
november
20th
drinkby
date
and
were
2
50
for
a
12pack
thats
about
all
id
pay
for
them
in
the
future
though
to
wrap
it
up
this
is
worth
splitting
a
six
pack
of
with
five
other
friends
but
only
because
of
the
shared
laughter
that
will
follow
everyone
can
have
one
get
a
good
laugh
maybe
pour
half
of
it
out
and
move
on
terrible
taste
like
mixing
a
lemon
juice
with
light
beer
and
then
adding
a
teaspoon
of
salt
smell
is
unremarkable
weak
head
not
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
like
drinking
cold
water
this
is
a
weak
attemept
at
tampering
with
beer
if
anything
is
added
to
beer
it
should
be
left
up
to
the
drinker
not
prepackaged
by
the
manufacturer
just
a
bad
idea
with
a
bad
result
ech
overall
a
good
beer
thats
very
drinkable
goes
down
nicely
ive
had
no
problems
pounding
a
few
of
these
back
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
is
my
girlfriends
staple
beer
i
tried
everything
i
could
to
get
her
to
drink
beers
with
me
and
this
is
the
only
one
she
likes
ive
had
a
couple
and
its
alright
i
can
taste
the
lime
but
i
would
drink
it
every
day
it
does
drink
down
smoothly
though
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
personal
taste
but
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
dno
do
not
ever
buy
this
beer
i
cant
think
of
a
single
reason
to
drink
or
like
this
stuff
its
not
appealing
to
the
eye
the
nose
or
the
overall
drinking
experience
d
a
little
flavorful
goes
down
easily
and
is
not
too
filling
since
there
isnt
much
of
anything
to
this
beer
other
than
the
lime
flavor
very
mild
kick
for
those
that
drink
the
macros
regularly
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
for
something
light
and
different
but
overall
its
a
beer
that
tries
not
to
taste
like
beer
i
was
offered
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
party
and
thought
i
may
never
have
a
chance
to
try
this
again
pours
a
clear
bright
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
salt
and
lime
the
taste
is
simply
revolting
salt
overpowers
the
flavor
and
its
not
something
i
like
in
my
beer
couldnt
finish
this
one
and
i
will
never
try
another
lime
flavored
beer
which
is
probably
for
the
best
this
beer
is
disgusting
and
i
cannot
understand
why
anyone
would
want
to
brew
it
or
drink
it
i
am
angry
about
this
beer
d
its
different
cant
compare
it
to
anything
and
it
doesnt
taste
horrible
good
summer
drinker
d
well
not
really
mfd
overfizzled
uber
light
body
not
the
worst
avoid
not
the
best
lime
n
salt
beer
but
will
do
for
the
cheap
price
and
by
the
way
this
low
in
cals
and
carbs
a
friend
had
left
this
in
the
fridge
from
this
past
weekend
so
i
was
curious
to
give
it
a
shot
it
is
what
it
is
and
its
barely
fits
into
the
category
of
beer
not
impressed
overall
i
can
drink
this
beer
i
enjoy
sipping
well
made
beers
and
i
enjoy
pounding
bmc
beers
i
can
pound
these
all
night
like
i
said
dont
drink
this
beer
thinking
its
going
to
blow
you
away
d
dont
do
it
on
of
the
few
beers
i
poured
down
the
drain
i
drink
light
lagers
and
drink
them
with
a
smily
but
just
not
this
one
drank
out
of
a
clear
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
the
label
on
the
bottle
neck
says
100
calories
bottle
describes
it
as
light
beer
with
natural
flavors
i
am
not
sure
what
the
natural
flavors
are
it
seems
like
this
is
millers
beer
to
attract
the
corona
crowd
trying
to
please
the
masses
not
to
terrible
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
but
it
wasnt
awful
just
not
impressive
bud
light
lime
is
better
for
the
money
i
think
d
it
goes
down
ok
but
the
lime
flavor
is
not
good
at
all
in
this
beer
drinkability
hopefully
i
wont
touch
this
one
again
dreadful
d
fairly
drinkable
given
what
it
is
but
i
wouldnt
ever
choose
to
have
this
again
d
not
horrible
but
not
really
beer
either
i
suppose
if
i
only
saw
a
cooler
full
of
this
and
natty
light
or
keystone
light
that
would
be
the
only
time
id
try
this
again
this
beer
is
clearly
confused
its
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
the
slight
lemon
and
miniscule
salt
are
the
only
flavours
and
theyre
not
pleasant
its
not
sweet
enough
to
be
a
chick
beer
its
not
refreshing
enough
to
pass
as
a
corona
substitute
and
its
too
watery
to
be
a
proper
beer
this
is
a
weak
ridiculous
travesty
of
a
beer
it
completely
lacks
flavour
and
it
is
about
as
undrinkable
as
you
can
get
avoid
this
was
just
like
any
other
bmc
but
it
had
a
nice
lime
flavor
to
cover
up
some
of
the
deficiencies
if
i
have
to
drink
a
macro
it
is
either
this
or
fosters
i
think
this
is
a
nice
adition
to
the
boring
lineup
at
the
bar
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
and
none
offfensive
taste
i
have
to
be
honest
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
in
the
end
i
couldnt
even
finish
one
bottle
and
had
to
dump
half
of
it
out
i
think
it
was
a
good
idea
by
sab
miller
but
in
the
end
it
was
poorly
executed
in
the
formula
back
to
the
drawing
board
miller
yuck
again
another
godawful
idea
from
millercoors
d
absolutely
brutal
i
wish
i
had
more
hands
so
i
could
give
this
beer
four
thumbs
down
mouthfeel
is
overyly
fizzy
and
thin
overall
this
is
a
cheap
beer
and
can
be
quite
tasty
on
a
hot
day
lawnmower
beer
at
best
even
that
may
be
pushing
it
but
really
it
would
just
be
about
the
same
as
drinking
a
cold
sprite
on
a
hot
day
so
thats
the
only
way
i
can
imagine
justifying
this
one
junk
drinkabilty
what
the
hell
where
they
thinking
i
cannot
believe
that
the
people
at
miller
actually
thought
this
was
a
good
idea
i
have
tasted
the
other
lime
cough
bud
cough
beer
and
that
kicks
the
shit
out
of
this
one
drinkability
very
easy
only
good
for
long
hot
days
md
the
feel
is
highly
carbonated
and
watered
down
showing
that
there
isnt
much
substance
to
the
beer
i
highly
recommend
avoiding
this
beer
since
it
is
hard
to
stomach
it
especially
after
smelling
it
if
you
took
miller
lite
and
left
it
in
a
pothole
in
the
road
for
a
week
mixing
with
some
leaves
and
such
then
salted
it
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
avoid
dont
even
try
for
the
fun
of
it
one
awful
aspect
of
this
beverage
i
refuse
to
call
it
beer
is
that
it
gives
you
some
nasty
ass
shits
once
again
nastier
than
my
ex
girlfriend
not
much
taste
to
it
watery
light
beer
with
lime
and
salt
added
to
it
it
is
okay
beer
to
drink
for
a
football
game
this
is
about
the
only
beer
that
i
will
drink
if
i
have
to
drink
an
adjunct
lager
one
thing
i
did
think
of
for
those
who
like
tomato
juice
and
beer
that
this
might
be
a
good
hangover
remedy
combined
with
some
bloody
mary
mix
or
spicy
hot
v8
d
definitely
drinkable
for
this
style
a
lime
in
the
bottle
definitely
improves
it
though
one
word
why
aroma
of
cooked
veggies
and
cardboard
quaff
of
spunky
corn
and
grits
i
also
think
someone
dropped
a
rotten
lime
in
the
mash
tun
wet
cardboard
in
the
finish
this
is
some
major
league
crappola
someone
at
the
brewery
washed
their
socks
in
this
brew
this
stuff
wouldnt
even
make
a
decent
marinade
pretty
freakin
worthless
mouthfeel
its
pretty
much
like
wet
air
the
thinnest
mouthfeel
that
ive
ever
experienced
in
a
beer
cool
16oz
aluminum
bottle
on
its
own
miller
lite
has
barely
any
flavor
the
addition
of
salt
enhances
what
maltiness
this
has
and
the
lime
accentuates
the
taste
further
without
dominating
its
a
light
beer
with
some
actual
flavor
mouthfeel
is
flat
but
this
is
the
only
disappointment
the
motto
for
this
situation
is
dont
fruit
the
beer
as
a
coffee
enthusiast
i
know
that
when
coffee
company
flavor
their
coffees
they
are
covering
up
the
bad
qualities
of
their
coffee
arabica
vs
robusta
i
can
only
imagine
this
concept
leaking
into
the
brewing
world
miller
brews
an
inferior
beer
but
markets
the
addition
of
the
lime
flavor
as
being
exotic
this
beer
may
have
an
impact
on
the
corona
and
lime
community
but
im
not
touching
this
one
again
ill
give
it
to
miller
at
least
theyre
trying
something
different
although
if
your
version
of
different
is
lapping
up
yesterdays
suds
from
a
from
the
floor
of
a
holding
cell
in
guantanamo
then
this
beer
is
for
you
tastes
like
miller
lite
with
salt
and
lime
pop
rocks
d
i
wont
be
having
this
beer
again
d
overall
was
way
to
carbonated
to
enjoy
like
lime
seltzer
water
and
not
one
i
found
refreshing
or
desiring
of
another
serving
a
big
pass
on
this
by
all
means
one
try
for
the
curious
save
your
money
on
a
six
pack
it
is
fairly
drinkable
as
it
is
wet
and
goes
down
quick
a
better
alternative
to
the
coronas
and
what
not
not
the
worst
choice
for
a
july
picnic
d
even
though
this
doesnt
come
across
as
much
of
a
beer
i
dont
really
mind
it
for
what
it
is
much
better
suited
for
the
party
crowd
and
best
on
a
summer
afternoon
im
sure
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
then
id
move
on
to
real
beer
drinkability
ive
had
a
few
of
these
and
they
certainly
go
down
easy
this
is
not
what
i
look
for
when
i
want
a
beer
though
among
the
least
beerlike
beer
ive
encountered
good
replacement
for
an
alcopop
if
you
find
smirnoff
ice
too
sweet
i
give
this
a
big
thumbs
down
the
bud
light
lime
is
a
much
better
choice
for
someone
looking
for
a
drinkable
beer
drinkability
well
its
crisp
and
lemony
and
light
it
fits
the
bill
for
this
category
its
good
enough
to
keep
drinking
but
i
dont
buy
this
shit
voluntarily
usually
im
a
pretty
big
fan
of
millers
beers
this
one
not
so
much
i
just
hate
the
fact
that
they
try
to
get
into
a
certain
market
in
this
case
the
coronabeach
market
this
one
was
tough
to
finish
much
worse
than
the
bud
lime
nothing
very
good
about
it
nice
on
a
scorcher
on
the
beach
maybe
never
again

i
bought
this
for
5
99
a
12
pack
its
the
right
price
for
a
late
summer
session
oddball
beer
its
not
a
regular
session
beer
but
i
would
buy
it
for
a
party
or
for
others
to
try
and
drink
its
cheap
and
interesting
to
try
once
if
this
review
sounds
interesting
but
not
my
style
for
sure
its
on
sale
in
the
late
summer
early
fall
likely
because
the
sales
hasnt
been
done
well
but
thats
good
since
its
cheap
i
can
buy
a
fair
volume
couldnt
finish
donated
the
rest
to
the
nats
flying
around
the
table
even
the
miller
girls
couldnt
inspire
me
to
drink
it
12
oz
bottle
pours
light
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
smells
like
dough
sweat
solvent
puke
and
a
splash
of
lime
the
smell
alone
should
have
been
a
deterrent
probably
better
not
to
pour
out
of
bottle
and
sniff
initial
flavor
was
sweet
with
a
salty
finish
and
lime
throughout
light
on
the
palate
taste
is
very
close
to
a
corona
with
a
lime
light
easy
to
take
a
few
but
overall
near
tasteless
except
for
the
lemony
notes
for
a
light
brew
i
have
to
admit
this
miller
product
isnt
bad
i
dont
think
id
ever
order
one
for
myself
while
patronizing
a
local
watering
home
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
at
a
backyard
barbecue
in
short
i
was
hoping
to
find
a
lighter
beer
that
would
go
reasonably
well
with
chips
n
salsa
but
alas
this
strange
brew
is
just
not
very
good
with
anything
i
cant
and
wont
drink
this
again
wow
this
stuff
is
not
very
good
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
kind
of
like
wanting
to
watch
a
train
wreck
tastes
pretty
artificial
easy
to
pound
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
thats
about
it
color
is
kind
of
yellow
with
a
green
tint
artificial
color
to
go
with
the
artificial
lime
more
artificial
tasting
lime
trying
to
spice
up
boring
beer
its
just
not
working
like
the
bud
lime
its
only
upside
is
that
its
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
make
sure
the
beer
stays
damn
cold
or
just
pound
it
quickly
it
becomes
undrinkable
when
it
warms
d
easy
to
drink
not
too
bad
actually
i
guess
this
is
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
would
rather
have
lime
koolaid
poured
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
was
a
lime
citruis
scent
with
a
touch
of
cereal
grains
the
taste
was
like
a
lot
of
citruis
and
cereal
it
was
very
sweet
and
overpowered
any
type
of
taste
of
beer
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
soda
pop
more
than
beer
very
watery
with
not
much
texture
i
was
disappointed
hoping
to
get
a
beer
that
would
be
satisfying
on
a
hot
day
and
did
not
get
it
okay
well
i
really
dont
think
this
is
much
of
a
beer
but
i
give
it
originality
and
a
good
marketing
campaign
this
really
is
more
of
a
summer
treat
i
doubt
to
much
is
sold
during
the
winter
months
i
just
like
to
have
this
on
rare
occasion
when
the
weather
is
really
hot
but
for
the
most
part
i
prefer
a
good
apa
in
that
situation
i
still
recommend
trying
at
least
one
d
not
going
to
be
served
at
any
of
my
gatherings
only
trying
this
one
on
curiosity
and
did
not
buy
it
and
dont
recommend
spending
money
on
this
stuff
quite
superior
to
its
counterpart
bud
light
lime
especially
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
like
i
said
you
cant
compare
this
with
the
great
pilsners
of
europe
but
it
does
work
well
with
spicy
mexican
food
why
not
pours
a
very
clear
haystack
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
minimal
head
smells
of
light
grains
and
citrus
lime
taste
is
very
watery
light
grains
lime
slightly
salty
just
strange
not
really
up
my
alley
id
rather
have
a
miller
lite
to
be
honest
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
lots
of
carbonation
like
a
coca
cola
or
the
like
strange
aftertaste
crystal
clear
pale
golden
color
first
beer
i
think
i
have
ever
seen
that
actually
reminds
me
of
urinereally
sizeable
head
low
aromafaint
hint
of
lime
but
nothing
really
there
moderate
snap
of
flavor
somewhat
cirtusy
tasting
with
a
hint
of
saltiness
ok
body
for
stylenot
overly
watery
but
not
much
more
this
is
ok
for
the
most
part
i
cant
trash
it
as
it
isnt
all
that
bad
imho
does
an
ok
job
for
what
it
is
trying
to
be
i
could
throw
a
few
down
on
a
hot
summers
day
though
certainly
not
my
first
choice
d
as
i
mentioned
above
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
as
a
party
beer
i
could
spend
a
whole
night
drinking
this
stuff
because
of
its
lightness
and
fruitiness
though
overall
it
doesnt
get
a
very
high
mark
from
me
i
love
this
beer
because
it
quenches
my
thirst
is
very
very
refreshing
and
does
its
job
at
parties
and
on
hot
summer
days
i
should
probably
wear
skirt
if
i
ever
try
this
again
lets
hope
that
never
happens
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
faint
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
the
essence
of
lime
and
salt
kind
of
refreshing
the
taste
is
average
at
best
it
has
a
lime
flavor
that
almost
resembles
zima
or
some
other
malternative
its
refreshing
but
it
holds
little
resemblence
to
beer
the
mouthfeel
isnt
that
good
as
well
its
a
low
bodied
beer
with
loads
of
carbonation
this
beer
doesnt
deserve
the
hype
its
watery
beer
with
lime
essence
big
deal
drinkability
is
nonexistant
i
guess
it
works
after
a
night
of
heavy
drinking
but
as
a
warmup
beer
even
this
beer
just
doesnt
cut
it
avoid
unless
free
then
try
for
your
own
purposes
overall
a
poor
beer
this
is
simply
terrible
beer
and
the
idea
that
people
are
buying
it
baffles
me
it
really
is
offensive
tasting
not
flavorless
and
boring
like
one
might
say
about
miller
lite
but
it
is
simply
offensive
to
the
mouth
do
yourself
a
favor
order
a
soda
this
is
absolutely
disgusting
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
like
a
flat
lemonlime
soda
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
can
be
felt
but
it
is
mostly
a
thin
syrupy
feel
i
forced
myself
to
finish
this
but
i
am
going
to
do
what
i
can
to
never
have
this
again
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
in
vegas
i
was
living
overseas
and
have
never
herd
of
it
i
was
surprise
at
the
taste
i
have
never
had
before
it
has
a
lime
taste
like
some
mexican
beers
it
is
a
good
summer
beer
its
very
light
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
but
not
my
least
favorite
you
know
i
thought
that
adding
a
little
lime
and
salt
might
make
miller
a
bit
more
bearable
well
i
guess
i
was
wrong
this
stuff
pours
the
traditional
clear
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
nose
is
grainy
with
a
hint
of
tartness
from
the
lime
the
flavor
is
similar
very
light
and
mostly
bad
artificial
lime
even
the
saltyness
taste
fake
a
watery
overcarbonated
body
lowers
the
drinkability
even
more
not
highly
recommended
i
am
honestly
perplexed
how
this
beer
is
selling
so
well
i
would
take
a
zima
even
a
freaking
tequiza
over
this
try
this
beer
if
youre
at
a
wedding
with
an
open
bar
and
youve
eaten
too
much
food
to
simultaneously
digest
the
regional
stout
otherwise
pass
squeeze
the
juice
out
of
a
key
lime
and
put
some
salt
all
around
and
voila
the
flavor
becomes
strikingly
similar
to
tecate
my
fave
cheap
beer
golden
in
color
pours
with
a
thick
head
that
lasts
for
a
few
seconds
smells
like
lime
and
beer
which
is
what
is
advertised
the
taste
is
not
bad
but
is
watery
with
a
highly
carbonated
bite
at
the
end
i
had
one
of
these
first
on
a
hot
day
in
august
and
had
about
3
before
the
feeling
subsided
i
tried
to
give
it
another
shot
and
still
feel
the
same
verdict
a
gimmicky
product
miller
chill
isnt
the
greatest
sin
ever
committed
by
a
major
brewing
company
but
it
definitely
doesnt
help
the
cause
of
beer
advocacy
it
has
more
in
common
with
smirnoff
ice
than
it
does
with
good
beer
happy
to
say
i
only
bought
the
one
come
on
miller
if
i
wanted
lime
water
id
shake
up
a
seven
up
and
dilute
it
with
water
this
seems
to
be
miller
knock
off
of
tequiza
a
pathetic
light
golden
brew
with
a
weak
white
head
smells
like
a
watered
down
virgin
margarita
tastes
the
same
if
you
have
a
mexican
themed
party
go
for
it
but
then
again
i
would
be
drinking
margaritas
poured
a
very
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
short
and
thin
white
head
that
had
some
lacing
down
the
glass
it
smelled
like
some
hints
of
light
malt
and
minimal
amount
of
hops
underneath
a
very
big
fake
citrius
and
salty
aroma
the
taste
was
awful
i
couldnt
finish
it
it
was
salty
and
skunky
tasting
only
beer
so
far
i
couldnt
finish
it
had
a
sour
and
bitter
and
skunky
mouthfeel
which
made
it
so
undrinkable
i
couldnt
finish
it
dont
get
this
i
didnt
it
was
given
to
me
d
i
would
recommend
leaving
this
one
alone
but
on
the
outside
chance
you
were
a
zima
fan
than
this
is
your
beer
nice
pour
looked
great
in
glass
actually
was
sharing
a
couple
with
my
63
year
old
mother
she
loved
it
and
has
not
been
a
big
drinker
her
whole
life
intil
recently
she
can
bond
with
my
22
year
old
sister
but
thats
another
story
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
it
didnt
look
to
bad
it
was
all
down
hill
fom
there
i
was
very
disapointed
and
couldnt
finish
my
whole
bottle
very
surprising
afeter
all
the
hypr
taste
was
just
not
good
but
this
shit
suck
ive
had
a
lime
with
my
high
life
and
i
like
that
but
this
shit
fucking
blows
pass
on
this
one
sweet
light
malt
almost
completely
covered
by
the
lime
flavor
and
some
grapiness
weird
watery
zimalike
taste
on
the
finish
tastes
like
a
really
light
beer
with
some
lime
juice
and
sweetener
added
it
was
sour
and
bitter
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
anyone
if
you
want
a
mexicanstyle
beer
get
a
mexican
beer
quite
a
few
of
my
friends
absolutly
love
this
beer
so
i
had
to
try
it
one
of
my
friends
bought
it
for
me
while
out
we
were
at
a
club
so
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
i
was
taken
aback
by
the
immediate
taste
of
it
these
same
friends
worship
corona
also
not
a
fan
but
i
failed
to
see
the
similarities
heavy
lime
where
there
was
flavor
also
malt
i
drank
about
half
and
couldnt
stomach
the
rest
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
do
think
it
tastes
better
in
the
bottle
so
dont
pour
it
up
unless
you
want
to
see
it
and
theres
not
much
to
see
i
really
expected
more
of
a
tequizastyle
absolute
nastiness
but
this
is
impressively
palatable
go
figure
not
that
im
a
fan
of
carona
and
lime
but
id
rather
have
that
any
day
over
this
will
not
be
trying
again
left
me
with
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
very
weak
light
yellow
pour
with
short
lived
bleached
white
head
smell
is
mostly
sweet
lime
and
slightly
margarita
like
taste
is
watery
salty
sweet
a
little
of
lime
nothing
great
but
barely
drinkable
i
probably
like
this
better
than
miller
light
but
who
cares
better
than
some
stuff
of
the
serious
crap
ive
had
but
not
by
a
whole
lot
as
one
rater
stated
it
really
does
taste
like
a
mix
of
beer
and
sprite
erin
says
tastes
limey
d
first
thought
to
enter
my
mind
after
trying
this
was
why
this
is
a
lame
gimmick
beer
that
now
that
ive
tried
it
i
will
not
be
having
again
sparkling
light
beer
lame
but
maybe
chelada
style
i
know
cheladas
and
this
is
no
chelada
ive
rehydrated
myself
on
cheladas
in
playa
del
carmen
and
they
tasted
nothing
like
this
if
they
did
id
have
let
myself
dry
up
and
die
a
dessicated
gringo
i
felt
compelled
to
try
it
ive
done
so
the
rest
goes
down
the
drain
12
ounce
bottle
single
bottle
bought
for
1
39
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
below
average
it
smells
like
limelime
soda
it
doesnt
smell
bad
at
all
but
then
it
doesnt
really
have
any
kind
of
beer
smell
either
but
there
arent
any
offensive
aromas
either
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
watered
down
lime
soda
and
it
doesnt
have
much
beer
taste
to
it
at
all
it
tastes
more
like
a
malt
beveragealcopop
than
it
tastes
like
beer
it
doesnt
taste
awful
but
it
doesnt
taste
good
either
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
it
also
has
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
very
good
but
i
can
get
through
a
bottle
of
this
so
it
isnt
too
awful
but
then
again
its
not
exactly
enjoyable
i
dont
like
drinking
it
but
its
not
bad
enough
to
make
me
want
to
vomit
compared
to
this
a
bud
or
a
milwaukees
best
sounds
good
luckily
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
i
couldnt
imagine
trying
to
drink
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
12
oz
glass
bottle
color
of
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
stark
white
head
nose
of
cilantro
line
zest
hay
grass
grainy
and
slight
bitterness

taste
of
lime
juice
and
grain
body
is
light
acidic
and
with
high
carbonation

aftertaste
of
lime
peel
slight
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
im
going
to
rinse
and
slip
an
imperial
stout
down
my
gullet
and
forget
this
episode
ever
happened
it
should
only
be
tried
very
chilled
almost
frozen
this
way
you
will
not
be
able
to
taste
it
it
should
be
a
sin
to
call
this
a
chelada
style
beer
i
have
tasted
perfume
by
accident
once
you
know
when
you
spray
it
the
wrong
way
directly
to
your
face
add
some
fizz
to
it
and
bamm
you
get
miller
chill
final
note
my
sisterinlaw
brought
this
over
to
my
mominlaws
on
christmas
eve
and
there
were
4
bottles
left
from
a
12
pack
at
the
end
of
the
night
im
glad
i
only
took
1
bottle
miller
chill
is
designed
to
be
consumed
cold
and
during
the
hot
summer
months

at
the
beachpool
side
or
lawnmower
beer
the
100th
beer
i
have
reviewed
is
also
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
the
displeasure
of
drinking
could
be
refreshing
for
those
who
dont
mind
the
taste
the
definition
of
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
i
hope
never
to
drink
it
again
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
bah
leave
bad
mexican
beer
production
to
corona
the
taste
is
mostly
bad
light
beer
trying
to
be
covered
up
with
salt
and
lime
not
good
stick
with
drinking
smaller
quantitys
of
well
made
beer
the
tase
isnt
horrible
but
the
aftertaste
is
what
makes
you
want
break
the
cardnal
rule
of
always
finishing
your
beer
you
really
want
to
toss
it
in
the
trash
not
at
all
drinkable
just
a
weird
mix
of
tastes
and
a
bad
smell
it
was
cheap
it
was
there
i
decided
to
buy
a
bottle
i
wasted
my
money
it
poured
a
very
light
straw
colour
with
a
head
that
persists
its
still
lingering
about
3
4
mins
since
i
poured
it
in
the
glass
it
has
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
down
the
side
sof
the
glass
too
it
smells
like
lime
cordial
and
tastes
like
salty
lime
cordial
with
a
fizz
and
a
hint
of
beer
i
think
that
its
pretty
much
like
the
bottom
of
a
canoe
this
beer
very
very
close
to
water
with
fizz
no
body
really
and
apart
from
the
lime
flavour
there
isnt
much
else
in
it
it
might
make
a
good
beer
for
adding
to
a
marinade
it
already
had
the
hint
of
lime
in
it
definitely
not
for
drinking
beer
should
not
taste
like
this
d
though
this
is
an
abomination
to
beer
it
really
doesnt
taste
bad
to
me
its
probably
my
favorite
from
the
miller
lineup
and
is
much
better
than
miller
lite
it
is
however
very
artificial
and
screams
macro
lager
i
dont
buy
this
one
myselfbut
my
friends
like
it
and
ill
drink
a
few
of
theirs
d
this
isnt
even
refreshing
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
its
actually
gross
i
will
drink
most
macro
stuff
if
i
dont
have
a
choice
but
i
would
not
drink
this
ever
again
period
i
guess
this
beer
is
what
it
is
a
cheap
alternative
to
corona
that
you
dont
need
to
put
a
lime
in
my
wifes
cousin
brought
some
of
this
to
thanksgiving
ill
try
anything
once
i
drank
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
it
really
didnt
taste
anything
at
all
like
beer
it
tasted
like
a
funky
lime
soda
with
some
salt
in
it
the
salt
made
my
stomach
queasy
and
i
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
not
recommended
i
sure
wont
be
stocking
it
this
is
a
decent
light
beer
with
a
distinct
lime
taste
you
dont
taste
the
salt
so
much
as
the
sweetness
similar
to
miller
lite
except
with
a
noticeable
sweeter
finish
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
for
parties
and
gatherings
with
friends
for
watching
games
on
t
v
with
light
appetizers
at
5
99
for
a
sixpack
its
worth
a
try
if
you
like
other
miller
beers
its
alot
different
than
what
ive
tasted
and
unique
in
the
sense
that
the
lime
flavor
is
very
pronounced
without
actually
adding
a
lime
to
it
it
has
a
low
alcohol
percentage
and
only
110
calories
for
a
12
oz
serving
so
you
could
drink
alot
of
this
and
enjoy
without
feeling
too
full
or
bloated
although
i
certainly
wouldnt
want
this
for
a
session
beer
come
on
you
beer
snobs
this
is
a
great
beer
sure
not
good
in
the
technical
term
but
good
in
the
laid
back
saturday
night
out
with
friends
beer
i
love
the
lime
in
this
one
although
the
salt
taste
is
evident
and
does
get
more
of
an
aftertaste
the
more
that
you
drink
it
sure
it
is
not
as
classy
or
manly
as
some
of
the
other
beers
in
your
convience
store
but
none
can
beat
its
drinkablility
so
kudos
to
miller
for
thinking
outside
the
box
definately
easy
to
drink
though
a
good
choice
for
a
stinking
hot
summers
day
and
a
pool
party
with
fine
women
as
im
sure
the
girls
will
dig
it
people
that
might
usually
head
for
premixed
spirit
beverages
will
probably
love
this
finish
well
im
glad
its
finished
d
definitely
a
onetrick
pony
with
the
lime
it
got
boring
before
even
one
serving
i
can
see
this
being
a
session
beer
for
nonbeer
drinkers
probably
designed
to
compete
with
smirnoff
ice
et
al
in
that
market
drinkability
not
that
good
was
offered
this
to
try
it
nothing
special
at
all
on
this
beer
would
rather
have
a
carona
not
sure
what
chelada
is
and
the
beer
is
not
good
enough
to
warrant
researching
further
the
beer
is
a
pale
yellowgold
color
with
a
thin
bone
white
head
very
little
lacing
is
apparent
aroma
of
lime
hard
candy
and
mild
malt
lightbodied
with
a
flavor
similar
to
any
lemonlime
carbonated
beverage
only
the
barest
hint
of
any
hops
or
malt
flavor
the
finish
is
carbonated
and
citrusy
pretty
worthless
overall
very
pale
colored
beer
with
an
with
an
extremely
faint
aroma
of
artificial
fruit
taste
is
watersalt
and
lime
i
am
a
big
fan
of
macro
lagers
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
enjoyable
about
this
beer
this
is
the
first
and
last
time
for
this
awful
stuff
overall
its
not
beer
more
of
a
malternative
but
surprisingly
it
is
drinkable
i
have
had
worse
beers
and
this
is
better
than
most
macros
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
it
was
a
bit
overpowering
as
far
as
a
beer
goes
way
too
much
of
a
lime
flavor
to
it
reminded
me
of
a
zima
or
tequiza
the
aftertaste
left
a
little
to
be
desired
i
could
drink
this
beer
if
it
were
the
only
thing
around
but
all
in
all
it
was
not
the
worst
i
have
had
but
definately
the
last
thing
i
would
grab
my
friend
means
well
but
has
no
idea
what
a
good
beer
tastes
like
he
is
a
natural
light
drinker
when
he
wasnt
looking
i
went
outside
and
dumped
the
rest
out
of
my
glass
that
i
couldnt
bare
to
finnish
i
quickly
grabbed
one
of
my
sierra
nevada
pale
ales
and
opened
it
before
he
could
offer
me
another
one
i
cant
believe
that
this
drink
actually
made
it
through
the
marketing
process
is
this
really
a
beer
i
guess
ill
treat
it
as
such
appearance
is
not
good
pale
transparent
yellow
with
minimal
and
quicklydisappearing
head
ive
smelled
this
smell
before
it
smells
like
when
you
have
a
party
and
wake
up
at
1130
the
next
morning
to
clean
up
all
the
beer
and
booze
bottles
and
you
discover
a
corona
thats
still
14
full
with
a
lime
thats
been
marinating
in
it
overnight
thats
what
this
beer
smells
like
i
think
thats
how
it
tastes
too
it
tastes
like
a
light
beer
with
some
margarita
mix
in
it
then
again
i
think
that
is
whats
trying
to
be
created
here
so
congratulations
miller
brewing
you
created
a
beer
that
girls
who
dont
like
beer
can
drink
ive
decided
not
to
judge
miller
chill
by
the
usual
beer
rules
if
i
did
so
the
scores
would
fall
significantly
right
across
the
board
keeping
in
mind
the
target
the
brewery
was
aiming
at
they
didnt
do
a
bad
job
it
goes
without
saying
but
chill
needs
to
stay
chilled
or
things
fall
apart
in
a
hurry
i
decided
to
try
this
with
an
open
mind
and
also
because
it
was
free
one
of
the
more
heinous
substances
i
have
ever
put
in
my
mouth
clear
golden
yellow
pour
with
fizzy
head
this
tastes
more
like
a
sierra
mist
or
fresca
that
has
gone
bad
rather
than
just
a
bad
miller
beer
product
has
an
extreme
artificial
chemical
taste
to
it
the
brewmaster
who
came
up
with
this
should
be
flogged
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
green
glass
bottle
with
a

glass
drinkability
ugh
a
horrendous
mix
between
a
zima
and
a
corona
it
doesnt
sit
well
and
is
a
bit
of
a
stomach
churner
glad
you
could
come
up
w
a
style
for
this
my
buddy
left
this
thing
in
my
fridge
i
will
give
it
this
it
looks
the
part
a
pale
strawurine
color
that
an
exotic
beer
should
be
a
faint
white
head
that
dissapeared
w
minimal
lacing
the
smell
was
a
comb
of
lime
peel
rice
i
steeled
myself
what
came
nextit
comes
off
ok
but
goes
downhill
from
there
can
almost
taste
some
malts
but
its
overwhelmed
by
the
lime
overpowering
prob
artificially
sweetness
like
sucrolose
maybeeither
way
not
good
for
the
beer
yeah
a
little
too
much
sugar
on
the
palate
gave
it
a
2
5
cuz
its
drinkable
up
to
a
little
over
half
way
im
done
pours
a
pale
yellow
no
head
or
lacing
involved
smelled
like
lime
and
the
sweetness
that
is
to
follow
taste
is
a
sweet
lime
flavoring
and
salty
like
advertised
absolutely
no
hops
no
malt
it
had
the
carbonation
of
a
not
quite
fresh
soda
bubbly
in
the
mouth
not
very
drinkable
and
nothing
like
a
beer
if
you
must
have
a
macro
summer
beer
this
would
be
it
i
was
not
impressed
but
this
is
a
better
version
of
zema
d
out
by
the
pool
on
a
hot
day
would
be
great
otherwise
i
would
not
be
able
to
stand
it
made
my
stomach
feel
funny
too
after
a
few
of
them
not
like
a
beer
that
i
am
accustomed
to
pours
a
medium
light
off
gold
color
very
clear
as
a
light
beer
is
no
head
retention
at
all
no
lacing
either
has
a
light
hint
of
lime
aroma
very
low
carbonation
bubbles
are
present
but
has
a
flat
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
bland
in
the
flavor
department
slight
citric
flavor
with
a
hint
of
a
sour
tang
possibly
the
salt
but
not
sure
the
after
taste
is
more
that
of
a
weak
margarita
than
of
any
kind
of
beer
this
was
not
a
pleasant
session
with
this
beer
im
pretty
sure
the
only
reason
i
bought
this
is
because
of
the
novelty
of
drinking
something
that
shouldnt
be
drank
the
lime
and
salt
made
me
think
i
was
drinking
a
nasty
margarita
or
a
diluted
tequila
shot
i
really
cant
say
that
it
was
bad
but
it
certainly
isnt
something
i
would
drink
frequently
or
even
keep
on
hand
for
a
friend
who
liked
it
it
nearly
gave
me
a
stomach
ache
because
of
its
outlandish
flavor
and
bipolar
identity
one
is
enough
thanks
pours
your
standard
macro
straw
color
with
little
head
has
a
funky
fake
lime
smell
that
funky
fake
lime
carries
on
over
to
the
taste
with
some
salt
the
carbonation
is
pretty
high
felling
on
a
beach
or
jimmy
buffet
concert
is
probably
the
only
time
that
i
would
ever
have
this
again
weak
showing
here
even
from
miller
i
find
it
funny
miller
did
a
comercial
their
round
table
promotions
with
burt
reynolds
jimm
johnston
ect
and
they
agree
not
to
fruit
the
beer
ie
corona
yet
they
make
a
miller
lime
flavored
to
compete
with
crona
and
well
its
about
equally
bad
so
i
guess
in
that
respect
it
suceedes
this
is
pretty
much
extra
light
miller
lite
with
fake
lime
and
salt
flavors
ive
never
heard
of
chelada
before
but
if
it
really
does
exist
this
is
probably
a
disgrace
to
its
style
its
not
even
real
beer
its
just
another
corny
malt
beverage
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
but
who
think
drinking
some
new
and
trendy
chelada
will
make
them
look
cool
seriously
how
many
people
have
this
in
their
fridge
at
home
nah
its
a
beer
to
order
when
you
go
out
when
youre
sick
of
corona
with
lime
which
is
1000
times
better
the
flavor
additives
are
the
worst
other
brewers
have
flavored
beers
of
course
like
thirsty
dog
raspberry
or
sea
dog
blueberry
but
at
least
they
are
constructed
with
a
decent
beer
behind
the
fruit
flavor
sorry
to
slam
ya
miller
cuz
i
grew
up
on
high
life
but
keep
it
real
youre
breaking
a
very
big
manlaw
here
very
big
drinkability
for
me
i
would
not
want
to
have
this
again
i
got
one
just
to
try
for
the
experience
this
is
a
novelty
beer

the

rep
brought
this
into
our
store
trying
to
sell
it
in
we
tried
it
and
miller
chill
more
like
miller
swill
the
lime
taste
just
didnt
taste
right
at
all
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
smirnoff
or
something
similar
they
made
a
bad
beer
worse
with
corona
adding
a
lime
does
actually
make
it
taste
a
bit
better
but
this
was
not
a
good
thing
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
highly
carbonated
drinkability
is

5overall
its
not
a
great
beer
and
another
buyer
in
the
store
said
his
wife
loved
chiller
which
i
guess
is
the
hip
new
name
for
it
amongst
those
that
enjoy
it
ive
had
other
light
beers
and
this
is
among
the
worst
for
me
i
think
if
the
lime
tasted
more
natural
and
they
toned
down
the
saltiness
it
wouldnt
be
so
bad
but
it
definitely
couldnt
be
compared
to
a
corona
im
not
quite
sure
i
understand
this
brew
and
what
miller
was
going
for
12
oz
bottle
that
has
a
strong
lime
smell
and
almost
no
signs
of
any
hops
taste
is
very
interesting
never
had
i
had
a
beer
that
was
more
part
something
else
and
less
part
beer
even
the
weakest
beers
have
more
than
50
beer
taste
but
not
miller
chill
this
brew
was
almost
75
tangy
lime
juice
water
and
25
light
beer
not
exactly
disgusting
but
not
what
i
would
call
beer
i
agree
with
the
assertion
that
chill
is
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
be
warned
looks
very
appealing
but
is
not
good
in
terms
of
being
a
beer
i
have
never
before
disposed
of
an
unconsumed
six
pack
beers
i
dont
dig
hang
around
until
someone
comes
to
visit
i
cant
think
of
anyone
i
dislike
enough
to
inflict
this
particular
beer
on
so
i
trashed
it
my
wife
ordered
this
took
a
couple
sips
and
said
she
couldnt
finish
it
in
the
interest
of
science
i
finished
it
pretty
clear
without
much
color
medium
head
that
quickly
disappeared
tangy
lime
aroma
but
smelled
artificial
the
taste
was
worse
i
think
there
was
supposed
to
be
some
lime
but
all
i
could
tell
was
it
tasted
a
little
tangy
not
even
very
refreshing
im
not
sure
why
anyone
would
intentionally
drink
this
beer
this
is
truly
a
beer
soda
pop
malt
beverage
designed
to
deliver
alcohol
not
recommended
just
get
a
corona
with
a
twist
and
youre
better
off
does
anyone
remember
abs
beer
tequiza
from
from
the
late
90s
this
tastes
almost
exactly
like
that
mix
7up
a
squirt
of
imitation
lime
a
miller
light
some
water
and
dash
of
salt
and
you
get
miller
chill
honestly
i
dont
hate
it
its
not
great
but
its
surprisingly
drinkable
everyone
on
this
website
is
going
to
be
mad
at
me
for
this
review
however
this
site
tells
people
to
review
a
beer
for
what
it
is
i
think
miller
chill
is
exactly
what
it
advertizes
it
is
a
refreshing
crisp
and
light
beer
im
not
saying
its
great
but
it
is
basically
miller
trying
to
create
a
beer
that
will
take
sales
away
from
st
louiss
1
mexican
beer
personally
i
would
drink
one
of
these
over
a
corona
any
day
stay
away
wanted
to
try
this
one
before
the
summer
ended
even
tho
i
had
my
reservations
that
this
would
be
a
tequiza
throwback
pleasantly
surprised
however
with
the
smell
taste
the
appearance
is
underwhelmingstraw
yellow
watery
thin
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
the
salty
smell
of
lime
and
hops
redeems
it
and
the
taste
follows
with
a
nice
kick
there
is
a
slight
sour
aftertaste
but
this
is
definitely
a
betterthanexpected
beer
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
cool
summer
night
12oz
green
bottle
very
very
light
yellow
translucent
body
almost
the
color
of
water
really
one
of
the
lightest
beers
ive
ever
seen
with
a
thin
white
film
smells
prodominantly
fruity
like
natural
lime
flavor
with
a
fair
bit
of
salt
too
tastes
sweet
like
lime
flavoring
with
a
little
salt
in
the
background
kind
of
reminds
me
of
sprite
or
sierra
mist
extremely
light
in
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
relatively
refreshing
though
i
have
to
say
the
jason
was
spoton
about
this
being
borderline
malternative
not
horrible
though
the
salt
flavor
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
but
definitely
not
something
ill
be
drinking
of
my
own
volition
or
on
my
own
dime
anytime
soon
overall
its
a
decent
brew
worth
trying
i
am
prefacing
this
with
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
wonderful
complex
beer
but
it
is
a
good
beer
for
the
masses
i
had
one
at
a
picnic
this
evening
and
succumbed
to
my
curiosity
the
color
is
typical
macro
lager
the
smell
is
sweet
and
limey
the
taste
well
it
kind
of
tastes
like
a
lime
zima
its
very
light
and
limey
and
very
carbonated
i
thought
that
it
tasted
almost
nearly
unlike
beer
but
i
dont
really
think
lambics
taste
much
like
beer
either
so
it
is
what
it
is
it
aint
purty
and
it
aint
complex
and
it
aint
smart
but
its
the
kind
of
cute
girl
at
the
bar
thats
fun
to
hang
out
with
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
quite
quaffable
the
feel
is
nothing
its
thin
and
watery
and
i
think
they
wanted
it
that
way
still
no
points
here
i
must
say
overall
its
not
a
horrible
summery
drink
its
light
enough
and
just
fruity
enough
to
be
thirstquenching
during
the
summer
they
call
it
corona
with
the
lime
already
included
but
id
have
to
say
this
is
a
step
above
not
great
but
certainly
not
awful
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
puny
little
white
head
with
no
body
the
smell
is
probably
the
worst
thing
about
this
it
smelt
like
a
wet
mop
seriously
you
know
how
an
old
mop
or
dish
rag
smells
like
thats
it
taste
is
god
awful
too
carbonated
and
the
lime
is
really
weak
tasting
about
as
bad
as
a
corona
with
lime
or
at
least
comparable
not
much
for
mouth
feel
besides
the
bubbly
annoyance
of
carbonation
i
wont
mention
drinkability
because
its
not
worth
it
not
impressed
at
all
its
actually
pretty
drinkable
all
things
considered
its
not
how
i
want
my
beer
to
taste
at
all
but
if
you
were
blindtasting
it
among
sodas
and
fruity
drinks
youd
probably
think
it
was
pretty
good
i
wont
ever
be
buying
this
beer
but
might
go
for
one
in
the
future
at
say
a
barbecue
if
all
thats
offered
is
corona
and
this
drinkability
trendy
as
im
seeing
many
fruitenhanced
beers
this
springsummer
its
no
less
refreshing
than
a
shandy
it
may
even
prevent
scurvy
theres
a
marketing
angle
they
let
get
away
much
too
pricy
at
a
buck
a
bottle
stay
away
not
many
beer
attributes
i
agree
with
assessment
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
chalk
this
up
at
a
borderline
malternative
a
beer
for
people
that
dont
like
beer
it
actually
tastes
like
a
really
bad
diet
soda
even
if
this
does
stick
around
for
more
than
several
years
and
not
deemed
a
fad
anymore
it
will
simply
live
on
as
a
subpar
product
for
the
ignorant
uneducated
consumer
hell
with
the
amount
of
soda
that
is
sold
in
the
us
this
one
will
probably
be
here
for
a
long
long
time
but
this
will
be
the
last
visit
here
as
this
is
a
big
fat
thumbs
down
the
substance
poured
a
very
very
pale
blonde
color
as
i
described
it
to
a
friend
it
appears
like
a
pint
glass
of
water
that
someone
soaked
a
corn
chip
in
for
a
few
minutes
and
displayed
a
surprisingly
thin
soapy
head
of
bright
white
the
nose
no
that
term
is
too
highbrow
for
this
beer

the
smell
was
of
pale
rice
grain
and
corn
with
an
entire
package
of
spree
candy
dumped
in
okay
upon
the
initial
tasting
this
beer
comes
across
less
like
a
beer
and
more
like
a
malt
liquor
product
like
zima
really
after
a
couple
more
attempts
it
dawns
on
me

this
is
a
simply
a
miller
lite
with
hawaiian
punch
added
i
detect
no
lime
although
there
is
a
cheap
candylike
fruit
thing
going
on
and
definitely
no
salt
for
this
im
actually
thankful
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thin
like
carbonated
water
and
the
finish
was
clean
and
spritzy

more
of
a
citrus
soda
in
this
regard
than
anything
else
i
can
think
of
at
the
moment
over
all
maybe
the
miller
folks
have
nailed
what
they
were
trying
to
create
a
chelada
which
is
basically
a
way
to
make
a
mexican
beer
taste
better
if
that
is
possible
i
know
full
well
im
not
the
demographic
theyre
trying
to
reach
with
this
one
but
man

i
dont
even
think
i
could
do
this
for
an
occasional
lawnmower
beer
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
id
have
certainly
preferred
a
cup
of
tea
but
if
youre
into
this
sort
of
thing
knock
yourself
out
low
and
behold
the
marketing
got
to
me
the
bottle
looks
great
wet
and
cold
i
grabbed
a
12
pack
at
the
local
kroger
along
with
a
12
pack
of
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
they
were
12
99
each
all
i
can
say
is
screw
you
miller
i
compared
my
stand
by
pale
ale
with
miller
chill
and
it
became
evident
that
miller
makes
a
defective
product
nothing
of
quality
is
evident
no
lime
hops
no
malt
no
anything
i
want
my
money
back
anyone
considering
miller
swill
ooops
chill
should
try
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
instead
for
real
beer
enjoyment
overall
this
beer
is
not
a
bad
attempt
by
a
major
brewer
there
are
some
interesting
qualities
but
it
should
not
be
confused
with
a
beer
that
is
meant
to
inspire
invigorating
conversation
it
is
a
beer
to
quench
thirst
i
tried
a
bottle
of
this
recently
and
i
thought
i
should
review
it
poured
into
a
plactic
cup
the
color
was
light
and
almost
transparent
it
lacked
smell
seriously
it
had
no
smell
the
beer
tasted
like
lemon
lime
soda
it
had
no
beer
taste
at
all
i
would
consider
this
more
a
malt
beverage
than
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
full
of
carbonation
drinkability
i
dont
know
how
to
answer
that
some
people
might
like
it
others
might
not
ill
give
a
new
macro
a
try
just
out
of
curiosity
but
normally
i
dont
bother
with
a
rating
im
making
an
exception
here
because
i
want
to
do
my
part
to
see
that
this
monstrosity
gets
the
low
rating
it
deserves
poured
a
pale
straw
typical
of
a
light
beer
aroma
was
an
odd
sweet
sodapop
flavor
was
dominated
by
a
sweet
koolaid
lemonlime
flavor
with
a
strange
metallic
aftertaste
that
i
suppose
was
intended
to
be
the
salt
flavor
but
was
more
like
putting
a
quarter
in
your
mouth
if
there
was
any
beer
flavor
in
this
beverage
i
couldnt
find
it
stock
this
next
to
the
zima
never
again
to
be
fair
ive
never
liked
to
add
a
lime
to
corona
so
maybe
some
personal
taste
bias
is
coming
in
here
however
it
is
a
massproduced
macro
with
very
little
personality
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
it
unfortunately
lacks
anything
to
distinguish
itself
d
seems
like
an
alcoholic
version
of
a
limeade
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
it
was
quite
refreshing
but
weird
it
was
certainly
better
than
millers
regular
products
pours
a
pale
yellow
fluffy
white
head
with
some
retentionand
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
weak
lime
body
is
light
and
carbionated
taste
is
a
light
ale
flavored
with
limeand
citrus
crisp
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
id
have
it
again
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
two
finger
frothy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
to
just
cover
the
beer
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
of
lime
was
weak
and
candy
like
taste
is
same
weak
flavor
grainy
very
dry
mouthfeel
light
crisp
lots
of
carbonation
the
citrus
tartness
is
not
there
i
would
rather
add
fresh
lime
to
my
own
beer
of
choice
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
is
initially
impressive
but
completely
vanishes
without
lacing
in
about
a
minute
aroma
of
lime
soda
atop
rice
husks
faint
fizzy
light
beer
taste
dominated
by
artificial
lime
soda
notes
fortunately
there
is
not
enough
taste
for
it
to
be
truly
horrid
strong
selzer
water
feel
makes
for
about
as
much
drinkability
as
most
common
light
lagers
but
the
lime
spike
doesnt
justify
the
premium
price
very
lightwatery
with
a
fizzy
tang
drinkable
like
a
glass
of
water
or
soda
not
drinkable
as
far
as
beer
goes
ordered
this
at
the
mexician
restaraunt
thougt
it
might
go
with
the
food
there
was
wrong
wish
i
ordered
a
bohemia
instead
had
to
order
a
bohemia
to
get
the
taste
of
the
chill
out
of
my
mouth
did
nothing
with
the
food
didnt
even
help
to
wash
it
down
just
another
gimmick
beer
even
the
wife
said
it
tasted
nasty
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
just
wanted
to
see
what
all
the
hype
was
about
as
usual
a
big
dissapointment
drink
this
beer
at
you
own
risk
overall
this
one
is
supposed
to
be
like
a
corona
with
a
twist
of
lime
laughable
a
complete
waste
ok
as
far
as
malt
beverages
like
zima
or
smirnoff
ice
go
but
an
utter
failure
as
a
beer
avoid
so
much
talk
about
this
beer
i
had
to
see
for
myself
what
to
make
of
it
i
dont
usually
dislike
american
macrobeers
the
way
many
bas
do
but
this
one
proves
to
be
a
challenge
to
the
taste
aromas
start
off
with
a
very
standard
millerish
aroma
but
quickly
release
moderate
citrus
notes
and
cerealgrain
aroma
swirled
around
light
maltiness
looks
very
pale
golden
with
brilliant
clarity
fizzy
head
retention
and
brilliant
clarify
tastes
do
the
same
thing
as
aromasstart
off
very
millerish
leaving
a
little
longer
lag
into
a
sweet
sprite
7up
taste
with
even
sweeter
adjuncts
and
cereal
grains
the
sweetness
seems
to
be
more
overpowering
than
even
the
lime
flavor
additions
or
salt
additions
in
fact
the
salt
character
would
go
largely
unnoticed
if
not
for
the
lable
the
texture
really
suffers
with
a
water
sugarwater
feel
prickly
carbonation
and
flat
texture
finishes
with
an
emphasis
on
the
sweet
grains
and
fading
lime
flavor
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
experiment
was
welcomed
and
an
introductory
to
a
littleknown
style
however
i
dont
feel
that
this
beer
represents
the
style
or
beer
community
best
i
dont
see
this
one
staying
on
the
shelves
long
drinkability
i
am
drinking
this
beer
never
again
miller
chill
was
a
pale
yellow
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
and
managed
to
leave
a
little
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
lime
and
some
grain
the
taste
was
mostly
lime
with
a
dry
somewhat
salty
finish
it
was
light
bodied
and
fairly
high
carbonation
drinkability
was
below
average
it
is
something
interesting
to
try
but
one
of
these
was
enough
for
me
thanks
to
pegasus
for
the
karma
point
d
not
a
beer
to
drink
i
dont
even
think
most
macro
lovers
will
enjoy
this
brew
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
great
paired
with
average
americanmexican
food
its
good
if
you
like
corona
with
lime
but
dont
like
packing
or
cutting
the
limes
this
one
might
be
for
you
anyhow
avoid
this
originally
reviewed
may
1
2007
from
a
12
oz
bottle
a
sniff
from
the
neck
yields
a
saccharin
rotting
corn
and
lime
rinds
appears
to
be
a
rather
clear
pour
flavor
begins
with
stale
corn
and
swiftly
slides
into
a
repugnant
fake
lime
juice
i
think
the
salt
provides
illusion
of
body
for
a
beer
that
would
typical
come
across
as
water
tastes
like
i
put
a
lime
in
a
corona
and
let
it
sit
in
the
hot
sun
for
an
afternoon
skanky
sleazy
and
overadvertised
i
think
that
miller
has
achieved
their
goal
of
being
compared
to
some
of
the
mexican
imports
but
overall
i
am
unimpressed
truly
awful
i
cant
believe
there
is
a
market
for
this
beer
a
year
from
now
will
miller
chill
be
on
the
market
ill
bet
it
is
not
this
is
much
worse
than
i
ever
thought
it
could
be
i
almost
sprang
for
a
sixpack
a
few
weeks
ago
thank
god
i
didnt
one
bottle
is
way
more
than
i
can
handle
avoid
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
is
pretty
much
lime
with
just
the
barest
hint
of
light
malt
but
pleasant
all
the
same
the
taste
is
light
lime
just
a
bit
of
bready
malt
a
touch
of
salt
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
altogether
not
really
much
like
beer
but
not
sweet
either
the
touch
of
salt
is
interesting
and
not
overdone
to
give
a
bit
of
a
margarita
flavor
it
is
not
a
margarita
however
much
lighter
and
a
bit
watered
down
it
is
not
corona
and
lime
either
regardless
of
the
ads
but
altogether
it
could
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
it
would
be
easy
to
get
several
of
these
down
ice
cold
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
headandshoulders
better
than
miller
lite
on
which
im
assuming
its
based
make
it
cheaper
put
it
in
a
can
and
youd
have
a
winner
i
was
quite
hesistant
when
i
tried
this
because
it
is
a
miller
product
and
was
warned
that
it
wasnt
great
however
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
drank
out
of
the
bottle
because
all
the
cups
were
used
so
i
couldnt
get
a
good
grasp
on
the
appearance
not
a
very
noticable
smell
either
sort
of
lime
but
not
strong
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
though
it
quenched
my
thirst
but
it
didnt
taste
quite
like
beer
it
sort
of
is
a
nonsweet
nottoosalty
limey
but
not
quite
margarita
flavored
water
went
down
smooth
and
i
was
actually
impressed
d
it
really
tasted
like
a
corona
with
a
couple
limes
in
it
too
much
lime
though
overall
this
was
a
decent
novelty
beer
and
went
well
with
the
chips
at
the
bar
but
i
would
not
bring
home
a
six
pack
of
this
nor
buy
another
bottle
anytime
soon
give
it
a
try
if
its
around
just
for
giggles
i
must
admit
i
normally
not
a
miller
drinker
but
as
a
true
ba
i
feel
its
important
to
forget
the
brewer
and
evaluate
the
beer
for
what
it
is
this
is
truly
a
nonbeer
drinkers
brew
the
verdict
here
is
that
this
brew
is
noting
bad
and
if
you
want
something
that
tastes
more
like
a
refreshing
drink
like
fresca
this
is
your
brew
i
prefer
a
brew
that
tastes
more
like
beer
and
water

swished
it
around
in

simply
said
the
smell
is
offputting

id
like
to
wait
until
after
the
big
day
still
have
a
fake

was
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
very
sweet
and
more
like
a
malt
beverage
than
a
beer
decently
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
a
frothy
carbonation
a
decently
drinkable
beer
but
its
a
decent
alternative

but
that
really
isnt
very
strong
and
i
could
see
how
it
could
actually
help
make

in
short
but
this
is
drinkable

a
pale

with

from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
that
declares
that
it
is
light
lager
flavored
with

it
smells
like
an
overly
sweet

tastes
kind
of
like
sprite
or
maybe
fresca
if
it
were
mixed
with
watery
beer
barely
recognizable

a

to
watered
down
for
my
liking
category
is
american
light
when
judging
by
bjcp
style
guidelines
color
and
smell
are
rated
high
i
would
never
drink
this
beer
by
choice
but
when
judged
by
style
and
not
taste
alone
it
scores
a
respectable
score
these
bring
the
total
score
up
again
do
not
mistake
a
high
score
for
a
good
beer
two
categories
scored
high
by
style
does
not
a
good
beer
make
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
lace
of
head
smells
like
the
standard
adjunct
lager
with
fermented
corn
pretty
smooth
going
down
mainly
because
the
lack
of
carbonation
not
much
flavor
here
but
more
than
bud
select
55
theres
a
little
corny
aftertaste
but
doesnt
last
long
for
a
super
light
lager
its
not
too
bad
when
did
beer
try
to
market
itself
as
a
health
drink
this
is
so
empty
and
flavorless
its
not
even
worth
existing
drink
beer
or
drink
water
by
the
way
out
of
the
can
its
pretty
nasty
but
if
you
pour
it
into
a
glass
or
a
mason
jar
some
esters
are
released
and
you
get
a
nice
almost
witsmelling
aroma
and
a
better
overall
flavor
profile
i
assume
most
folks
are
drinking
this
straight
from
the
bottlecan
try
pouring
it
for
better
results
just
way
to
watered
down
to
consider
an
enjoyable
beer
something
to
drink
to
get
drunk
and
stay
thin
if
you
like
water
with
a
hint
of
coloring
this
beer
is
for
you
if
youd
like
to
get
drunk
off
of
this
beer
be
prepared
to
drink
a
case
and
hit
the
head
often
its
so
watery
and
unflavorful
that
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
anybody
if
you
want
a
decent
light
beer
try
a
sam
adams
light
and
leave
this
stuff
in
the
discount
cart
for
people
who
dont
care
how
a
beer
tastes
pours
an
almost
clear
yellow
with
no
head
the
smell
was
very
metallic
even
though
it
was
from
a
bottle
the
taste
was
a
lot
of
rice
and
some
metal
not
very
appetizing
i
guess
this
is
what
happens
when
you
strip
a
beer
down
to
64
calories
and
carbonate
the
hell
out
of
it
most
of
the
flavor
to
me
honestly
is
seltzer
carbonation
and
the
rest
is
as
if
you
diluted
another
light
beer
half
and
half
with
water
and
added
corn
this
beer
lacks
flavor
like
nothing
i
have
experienced
so
far
but
then
again
i
also
got
a
single
of
bud55
the
thing
that
makes
no
sense
to
me
is
i
dont
think
many
people
would
drink
this
without
getting
buzzed
in
mind
at
2
8
you
would
consume
many
of
these
to
get
a
buzz
and
the
calorie
drop
is
cancelled
out
do
people
forget
how
to
do
math
after
seeing
the
excessive
marketing
for
such
beers
this
surprisingly
isnt
horrible
but
pretty
damn
close
and
unlike
a
few
other
beers
ive
had
recently
this
is
drinkable
if
only
just
not
refreshing
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
as
i
found
myself
yearning
for
the
bottom
of
the
glass
to
approach
ill
sum
this
up
with
this
sometimes
you
have
to
have
a
bad
beer
to
enjoy
a
the
good
ones
thats
exactly
what
this
experiment
was
for
me
i
will
spend
the
rest
of
my
days
ensuring
i
never
drink
this
one
again
its
really
the
only
reason
you
should
have
for
consuming
this
as
well
opinions
vary
but
this
is
the
best
light
beer
i
have
tasted
my
wife
has
bought
them
all
bud55
miller
lite
my
old
favorite
light
mic
ultra
ok
i
do
love
mic
ultra
amber
but
hard
to
find
in
mn
etc
and
miller
64
has
become
a
staple
in
our
refrigerator
it
is
light
fresh
crisp
and
tastes
like
well
it
tastes
like
beer
it
has
a
low
alcohol
content
so
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
or
out
on
a
bike
ride
tastes
great
with
pizza
im
comparing
to
coors
light
bud
55
etc
obviously
this
beer
is
intended
to
be
something
to
down
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
for
someone
who
is
perhaps
trying
to
cut
down
their
drinking
without
switching
to
na
beer
miller
64
is
what
it
is
it
possesses
good
carbonation
a
fine
straw
color
when
poured
and
holds
it
own
against
the
other
macro
brands
beer
flavored
water
not
bad
just
not
worth
writing
home
about
if
there
is
no
flavor
then
it
cant
be
bad
i
keep
this
around
for
my
light
beer
visitors
and
decided
to
crack
a
few
havent
had
aal
light
in
a
long
time
now
i
remember
why
also
it
provides
no
buzz
after
five
cans
2
8
abv
lager
at
least
its
union
made
which
is
the
only
sociallly
redeaming
thing
this
about
this
fizzy
yellow
water
sort
of
kind
of
beer
like
beverage
its
technically
well
made
there
is
just
nothing
to
work
with
its
like
the
beer
version
of
the
fatfree
muffin
youre
just
taking
away
the
whole
point
by
insisting
on
a
product
with
next
to
no
calories
p
s
follow
hulk
on
instagram
hulkbeer
would
not
buy
i
would
go
to
gym
and
get
some
exercise
and
drink
something
better
i
wish
you
could
give
this
less
than
1
i
understand
that
we
are
to
keep
in
mind
the
style
when
rating
but
this
tastes
like
the
brewery
workers
drank
some
miller
light
filtered
it
through
their
own
kidneys
stored
it
in
their
bladders
for
a
while
then
well
you
get
the
picture
seriously
this
is
bad
beer
overall
well
it
looked
ok
unless
you
just
want
to
look
at
it
this
beer
is
one
to
definitely
avoid
as
its
taste
was
pretty
atrocious
well
swimsuit
seasons
coming
up
so
weve
gotta
watch
those
calories
eh
guys
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
sweet
corn
light
funky
wheat
and
a
touch
of
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
more
hardness
to
the
water
and
a
slightly
sharper
funkiness
from
the
nowgrassier
wheat
the
body
is
rather
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
limp
sad
beer
one
that
certainly
isnt
much
of
a
poster
child
for
the
fewer
calories
but
all
the
flavor
camp
give
me
the
calories
okay
this
is
a
light
beer
and
i
suppose
that
i
should
review
it
in
that
light
however
it
is
also
nearly
tasteless
it
is
watery
pale
yellow
in
color
moderately
carbonated
and
nearly
completely
devoid
of
any
smell
or
flavor
some
spritzy
carbonic
bite
but
nothing
that
tastes
like
beer
not
worth
drinking
if
you
want
to
taste
your
beverage
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
miller
took
their
concocted
piss
water
and
added
even
more
water
to
it
stale
flavor
and
smell
mouthfeel
of
lukewarm
water
and
a
miserable
sickly
pale
color
the
only
reason
i
could
imagine
drinking
this
is
because
of
the
low
calories
but
if
that
is
the
issue
eat
a
salad
once
in
a
while
weighing
in
at
2
8
abv
youd
have
to
bong
a
case
of
these
things
just
to
get
a
slight
buzz
which
would
offset
the
low
calories
as
will
everything
under
the
miller
label
this
is
just
downright
awful
i
actually
heard
there
was
a
scene
in
the
movie
zero
dark
thirty
when
they
interrogated
a
guy
by
making
him
drink
one
of
these
after
one
sip
he
begged
to
be
water
boarded
this
beer
is
pure
torture
o
not
good
it
scored
some
refreshment
points
but
its
lack
of
taste
or
flavor
cant
be
overlooked
yeah
needless
to
say
i
wont
be
having
this
one
again
its
just
so
flavorless
and
empty
if
youre
going
to
drink
a
beer
then
drink
a
beer
with
this
stuff
whats
the
point
im
actually
impressed
by
the
almost
total
lack
of
flavor
effervescent
carbonation
moderately
light
in
body
extremely
watery
overall
i
wont
say
this
is
the
worst
light
beer
ive
had
because
it
wasnt
it
wasnt
unpleasant
it
just
wasnt
there
at
all
really
and
i
had
a
hard
time
seeing
the
point
of
drinking
something
like
this
the
abv
is
so
low
it
wont
have
an
intoxicating
effect
if
thats
whats
desired
and
by
the
time
it
does
youd
have
drunk
enough
of
these
that
you
could
have
had
a
better
beer
certainly
not
my
thing
id
rather
not
drink
anything
and
save
the
calories
altogether
compared
to
other
beers
in
this
category
i
think
its
decent
theres
no
point
in
comparing
this
to
a
craft
ipa
for
instance
thats
not
the
goal
of
the
beer
when
compared
to
other
major
diet
beers
i
have
to
say
this
ranks
high
because
it
achieves
a
goal
of
not
offending
me
other
diet
beer
or
nondiet
beers
even
such
as
budweiser
platinum
and
rolling
rock
offend
me
and
theyre
not
even
trying
to
go
local
there
is
no
reason
to
drink
those
beers
this
on
the
other
hand
serves
a
purpose
and
doesnt
give
me
a
sour
face
so
im
rating
this
with
that
in
mind
pale
fizzy
straw
yellow
in
look
scent
is
pale
watery
with
only
a
faint
whiff
of
stale
light
beer
taste
is
again
very
light
somewhat
undiscernable
from
a
regular
light
beer
once
youve
had
1
or
2
stale
tasting
light
corn
thin
and
watery
compared
to
bud
55
this
atleast
tastes
like
light
beer
and
still
thats
not
a
great
thing
i
actually
have
a
hard
time
thinking
of
this
beverage
as
beer
typical
light
beer
look
and
scent
very
little
taste
to
speak
of
beerflavored
water
one
possible
use
would
be
as
a
spacer
for
a
night
a
tasting
higher
abv
selections
seltzer
waterco2
bitter
tang
up
front
light
corny
maltiness
follows
hint
of
honey
sweetness
not
much
there
slight
cardboard
bite
as
mineral
water
bitterness
takes
over
the
finish
light
bodied
with
a
fizzy
seltzery
feel
not
much
taste
in
this
not
offensive
but
not
worth
drinking
i
will
say
this
its
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
didnt
have
those
awful
applelike
or
metallic
notes
that
often
accompany
macro
lagers
it
is
a
bit
sweet
and
it
is
way
over
carbonated
but
otherwise
its
just
a
very
thinned
out
version
of
mgd
i
picked
this
up
on
a
day
that
i
had
to
drive
and
was
attending
a
cook
out
it
was
good
to
swig
in
the
hot
sun
and
i
was
able
to
drive
home
this
is
what
is
suppose
to
be
a
very
lightly
flavored
low
calorie
beer
nothing
id
seek
out
but
could
put
one
away
if
thirsty
enough
just
wouldnt
spend
my
own
money
on
it
gross
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
even
corona
light
is
miles
ahead
of
miller
64
in
taste
my
favorite
thing
miller
has
even
done
is
pabst
blue
ribbon
but
this
sir
is
a
poor
ripoff
of
what
a
beer
should
be
for
cheap
beers
ill
stick
to
pabst
blue
ribbon
miller
light
coors
coors
light
and
narraganset
miller
64
will
never
touch
my
lips
again
never
overall
compared
to
the
other
light
lagers
that
i
have
had
this
was
the
least
appealing
i
had
several
before
reviewing
so
as
to
give
it
a
fair
chance
but
this
is
not
a
satisfying
drink
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
corn
somewhat
musty
wtf
i
would
describe
the
taste
as
soon
as
i
find
one
the
is
by
far
the
weakest
beer
i
have
ever
tried
i
am
struggling
to
find
any
flavor
profile
other
than
water
feels
like
water
in
the
mouth
and
overall
most
na
beers
i
have
had
taste
more
like
beer
than
this
one
o
despite
its
light
almost
nonbeer
stature
in
individual
scoring
i
still
like
this
as
a
refreshing
drink
its
one
of
those
classically
easytodrink
lagers
that
go
good
with
a
lawn
barbecue
or
a
good
college
football
tailgate
in
settings
where
beer
isnt
necessarily
the
culinary
focus
but
having
a
couple
refreshing
easytodrink
beers
with
friends
is
key
its
an
american
tradition
it
would
do
many
of
us
good
to
remember
why
we
started
drinking
beer
in
the
first
place
overall
during
my
college
days
i
drank
beers
like
this
not
my
style
nowadays
but
if
its
a
hot
summer
day
it
would
probably
be
better
than
gatorade
i
like
the
term
lawnmower
beer
im
not
even
sure
how
this
has
as
high
ratings
as
it
does
it
might
have
to
do
with
the
fact
they
dye
the
beer
to
make
it
darker
than
it
actually
is
i
would
definitely
choose
this
over
miller
lite
buts
thats
like
deciding
between
animal
blood
and
urine
there
is
no
head
no
smell
its
extremely
light
but
if
your
a
fatty
and
you
think
this
will
help
keep
the
pounds
off
then
feel
free
to
drink
this
yellow
dye
miller
64
is
a
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
obviously
for
those
who
are
conscious
about
their
carb
intake
but
still
have
a
hankerin
for
beer
i
say
quality
over
quantity
anyway
the
beer
pours
yellow
clear
with
good
carbonation
that
forms
a
head
which
dissipates
over
time
the
smell
and
taste
are
typical
grain
slight
hop
mouthfeel
is
nothing
to
describe
really
more
like
water
than
beer
overall
its
water
with
beer
flavoring
i
enjoy
good
flavorful
beer
i
also
can
not
see
my
toes
considering
that
the
good
stuff
is
usually
upwards
of
200
calories
i
can
stand
to
drink
a
light
beer
or
two
my
wife
hardly
drinks
at
all
anymore
but
when
we
go
to
parties
well
buy
a
12
pack
and
shell
only
drink
two
so
we
always
have
this
in
the
fridge
this
beer
is
not
offensive
just
not
much
there
pale
yellow
with
average
mouthfeel
no
smell
to
speak
of
tastes
like
nothing
really
i
guess
6
of
these
would
be
pretty
refreshing
and
then
by
that
point
i
guess
you
dont
really
care
what
it
tastes
like
oh
well
just
finished
a
5
mile
run
and
was
feeling
healthy
so
i
tried
one
ill
probably
drink
some
more
but
not
because
i
want
to
my
gut
says
i
need
to
like
having
sex
in
a
canoe
indeed
d
very
light
and
crisp
with
a
refreshing
finish
easy
to
drink
but
with
this
lack
of
really
any
flavor
i
will
gladly
pass
to
sum
up
drink
if
dehydrated
otherwise
be
afraid
be
very
afraid
this
is
my
cheap
low
calorie
go
to
beer
overall
nothing
too
impressive
good
for
a
break
between
better
and
more
alcoholic
beers
this
is
a
good
replacement
for
water
next
to
no
taste
and
is
fairly
carbonated
the
only
good
part
of
the
beer
is
that
it
is
cheap
and
cold
still
better
than
bud
light
overall
i
would
never
drink
it
again
ever
pours
very
pale
gold
with
maybe
a
half
inch
of
white
head
head
exits
rapidly
smell
is
maybe
a
touch
of
corny
grains
really
hard
to
smell
anything
at
all
taste
is
beer
water
take
a
standard
miller
genuine
draft
and
dump
half
the
glass
fill
to
the
top
with
sparkling
water
and
this
is
what
you
would
get
o
k
maybe
just
pout
out
40
yes
you
could
drink
this
every
waking
hour
and
still
function
pretty
well
but
why
would
you
much
better
to
cut
back
to
one
good
beer
per
day
if
calories
or
abv
is
an
issue
a
very
light
straw
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
no
smell
here
at
all
hmm
no
taste
either
just
fizzy
water
and
maybe
some
grain
mouthfeel
is
extremely
light
with
lots
of
bubbles
very
smooth
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
there
is
nothing
that
taste
bad
about
it
if
you
plan
on
getting
hammered
and
want
to
save
the
calories
then
this
beer
will
do
the
trick
odi
guess
i
understand
the
concept
behind
this
beer
concerning
the
calories
and
what
not
nevertheless
this
beer
sucks
you
would
have
to
drink
about
seventy
if
your
trying
to
get
drunk
and
by
that
point
the
calories
will
probably
add
up
boo
i
certainly
dont
hate
it
like
i
do
a
lot
of
other
light
lagers
it
is
slightly
respectable
in
its
attempt
to
market
itself
as
a
64
calorie
beer
but
it
is
so
low
alcohol
it
seems
its
only
use
is
to
swig
when
you
are
hot
these
types
of
further
dumbeddown
beers
remind
me
of
one
thing
when
you
pour
too
much
water
into
a
caskstrength
whiskey
at
least
then
you
could
fix
it
by
just
topping
up
with
more
whiskey
no
such
luck
here
im
afraid
overall
to
be
fair
i
must
consider
what
this
is
a
64
calorie
lite
beer
in
comparison
with
other
beers
of
this
specific
style
i
really
cant
knock
it
in
fact
its
fairly
refreshing
after
being
in
the
heat
and
i
like
being
able
to
throw
back
a
few
of
these
quickly
and
not
be
buzzed
or
bloated
its
exactly
what
i
want
from
a
64
calorie
lite
beer
miller
genuine
draft
light
64
has
a
thick
but
quickly
dissipating
white
head
and
a
clear
straw
appearance
with
some
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
a
lighter
version
of
regular
mgd
corn
barley
plus
sweetness
taste
is
also
similar
to
miller
high
life
or
the
genuine
draft
corn
sweetness
and
that
odd
cooked
vegetable
flavor
but
mgd
64
is
like
the
regular
ones
with
water
added
to
half
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
extremely
watery
and
mgd
light
64
finishes
dull
veggie
and
dry
overall
this
is
poor
and
i
would
recommend
that
you
avoid
it
rjt
give
it
a
try
if
you
want
a
low
alcohol
low
calorie
light
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
onot
a
great
beer
in
any
way
has
good
color
but
fails
to
impress
in
the
other
three
categories
not
a
beer
that
you
would
ever
want
to
brag
about
or
spend
lots
of
money
on
this
is
a
little
better
than
bud
select
55
either
way
though
this
brew
is
weak
far
too
light
for
anyone
to
enjoy
on
a
quality
level
this
beer
doesnt
serve
much
of
a
purpose
other
than
for
economic
reasons
topping
off
at
2
8
abv
they
should
almost
consider
making
this
beer
an
na
brew
d
this
is
as
close
to
water
as
a
beer
gets
it
is
altogether
unoffensive
but
only
because
it
is
so
weak
d
great
drinkability
d
so
boring
like
fizzy

i
can
stomach
this
beer
because
it
has
some
flavor
it
is
still
a
boring
beer
though
in
the
realm
of
light
beers
though
this
brew
is
better
than
most
hey
you
cant
expect
too
much
from
something
like
this
but
it
gets
the
job
done
low
caldrinkabledoesnt
stink
d
practically
like
drinking
slightly
sweet
soda
water
so
you
could
imagine
its
drinkable
d
actually
very
drinkable
not
in
the
delicious
beer
sense
but
in
the
aforementioned
mineral
waterthirst
quenching
sense
i
drink
these
now
and
then
when
i
dont
want
to
get
drunk
while
slamming
beers
during
a
football
game
its
drinkable
in
the
same
way
water
is
but
if
i
want
a
beer
im
definitely
not
reaching
for
this
miller
genuine
draft
was
admittedly
popular
with
me
when
i
was
younger
this
just
showed
my
inexperience
in
different
types
of
beer
after
experimenting
with
other
beers
i
realized
this
a
piss
poor
beer
the
appearance
is
nearly
clear
looking
the
smell
is
twangingly
awful
the
taste
is
borderline
wretched
the
taste
it
leaves
in
your
mouth
is
harsh
it
immediately
makes
you
want
to
wash
out
your
mouth
with
soap
it
was
hard
for
me
to
drink
just
one
almost
painful
to
drink
this
beer
im
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
didnt
finish
the
six
pack
i
got
and
gladly
did
not
care
about
losing
the
money
i
spent
on
this
beer
highly
dislike
and
definitly
deserves
to
be
put
in
one
of
the
circles
of
hell
from
dantes
inferno
d
i
dont
get
the
point
of
this
beer
sure
the
64
calories
thing
is
cool
but
you
could
just
carbonate
some
tap
water
and
have
the
same
flavor
with
zero
calories
poured
out
of
a
clear
bottle
into
a
chilled
glass
this
beer
produced
a
half
finger
head
that
disappeared
before
i
could
get
a
good
look
at
it
no
thin
ring
no
lacing
the
color
is
light
amber
rating
a
3
on
the
srm
chart
bad
smell
like
that
of
a
can
of
mushrooms
that
has
just
been
opened
bad
i
didnt
know
if
i
wanted
to
taste
is
but
i
did
bland
mushroom
taste
with
a
little
corn
and
rice
i
guess
i
should
expect
much
taste
for
64
calories
feels
like
water
in
my
mouth
but
a
little
dry
i
will
avoid
this
beer
as
there
are
better
light
beers
out
there
maybe
this
beer
is
just
old
i
dont
know
as
there
is
no
date
on
the
bottle
pours
a
nasty
looking
off
straw
color
with
high
carbonation
virtually
no
head
or
lacing
smells
like
air
well
it
does
not
really
release
any
smell
tastes
like
piss
a
quite
terrible
taste
mouthfeel
was
just
plain
bad
high
drinkability
they
should
have
named
this
beer
miller
ghost
because
its
just
not
there
faint
smell
faint
taste
very
pale
yellow
color
and
a
soapy
head
that
just
vanishes
it
was
like
drinking
water
that
you
have
to
have
an
id
to
buy
it
doesnt
even
have
the
redeeming
quality
of
taking
the
edge
of
because
of
the
low
abv
percentage
mgd
64
might
be
a
good
brew
to
have
if
you
wanted
a
couple
of
beers
and
were
driving
but
i
like
to
keep
it
on
the
safe
side
and
refrain
all
together
if
you
want
to
drink
a
beer
then
not
be
able
to
tell
you
drank
one
then
go
ahead
and
pick
this
one
up
otherwise
just
avoid

i
really
dont
mind
this
stuff
and
think
it
has
its
place
like
when
youre
outdoors
or
want
another
beer
to
cap
things
off
but
want
to
overdo
id
probably
take
it
in
an
eitheror
for
life
over
my
favorite
old
stock
ale
for
reasons
outlined
above
why
people
drink
these
are
beyond

a
triple
this
went
down

to
a

if
youre
desperate
to
get
a
cheap
mild
buzz
but
dont
want
to
ingest
too
many
calories
go
sniff
some
glue
if
youre
trying
to
watch
your
weight
this
might
be
a
worthwhile
item
to
keep
in
inventory
but
be
forewarned
if
you
have
any
other
beer
in
the
house
this
one
will
probably
collect
dust
while
you
deplete
your
stash
of
alternatives
mgd
64
has
a
slight
corn
malt
smell
to
it
the
pour
results
in
a
vigorous
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
it
is
a
pale
yellow
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
bodied
and
a
big
lively
carbonation
it
has
a
corny
sweetness
to
it
but
no
big
beer
forward
attributes
it
does
however
have
more
flavor
to
it
than
michelob
ultra
that
really
isnt
saying
too
much
though
not
recommended
d
there
is
nothing
all
the
great
about
that
beer
other
than
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
several
nothing
to
be
proud
of
but
it
is
somewhat
better
than
some
other
light
lagers
drinkability
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
more
friendly
beer
in
my
life
the
beer
isnt
strong
and
goes
down
easy
low
calories
ibu
and
cost
that
being
said
while
it
is
friendly
its
not
great
this
is
not
a
personal
favorite
but
it
works
well
if
youre
on
a
budget
also
being
a
low
calorie
beer
it
can
be
nice
if
youre
trying
to
lose
weight
by
cutting
cals
or
carbs
ultimately
this
really
isnt
a
good
choice
there
are
plenty
of
other
alternatives
if
youre
just
looking
for
a
beer
with
a
low
calorie
count
d
decent
drinkability
pretty
good
for
a
light
beer
could
see
myself
pounding
these
down
and
for
the
price
its
not
a
bad
idea
taste
follows
with
light
grain
initially
becoming
a
vacuous
void
after
just
a
second
or
so
as
the
dryness
of
the
beverage
becomes
apparent
grainy
in
feel
helps
make
this
beer
somewhat
drinkable
and
much
better
from
a
glass
than
my
one
prior
experience
directly
from
a
can
touch
of
lemon
on
the
finish
better
than
the
masses
say
yet
whats
the
point
overall
i
really
dont
see
the
point
to
this
lowcalorie
beer
craze
people
its
only
beer
treat
yourself
to
something
nice
you
deserve
it
dont
feel
guilty
drinkability
for
the
style
this
is
above
average
and
i
have
graded
to
that
standard
it
is
nice
light
and
sweet
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
activities
especially
on
a
hot
day
it
certainly
will
not
get
you
drunk
surprisingly
good
for
what
it
is
overall
not
much
to
report
here
barely
beer
but
refreshing
got
to
try
it
for
free
at
my
grandparents
so
hey
free
beer
there
are
better
light
beer
alternatives
out
there
but
if
youre
really
trying
to
squeeze
your
calorie
budget
it
is
the
2nd
lightest
beer
in
that
aspect
this
ones
badgepatch
may
now
be
in
jeopardy
d
this
is
a
excellent
lowcarb
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
note
again
i
know
that
this
is
a
macro
and
light
on
top
of
it
but
because
it
is
striving
to
be
a
really
light
beer
it
is
actually
not
bad
for
that
particular
market
i
expected
it
to
be
a
lot
worse
drinkability
all
depends
if
you
cant
afford
the
calories
but
still
want
to
drink
a
2
8
beer
have
at
it
i
guess
cheers
frankly
a
horrifying
brew
i
guess
it
can
be
considered
beer
only
by
the
strictest
of
definitions
very
little
taste
and
not
enough
alcohol
to
matter
i
guess
i
understand
the
diet
beer
concept
but
i
see
absolutely
no
point
to
drinking
this
at
all
if
you
are
trying
to
save
calories
drink
water
maybe
d
very
drinkable
but
so
is
water
if
you
have
the
need
to
be
on
this
nearexcuse
for
a
beer
then
youll
develop
a
tolerance
for
many
sessions
pours
a
pale
yelllow
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
like
nothing
better
than
smelling
bad
i
suppose
tastes
of
carbonated
mineral
water
very
little
malt
or
sweetness
to
be
found
the
finish
has
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
likely
because
there
is
no
malt
to
counteract
any
hops
at
all
mouthfeel
is
that
of
water
basically
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
better
the
beer
is
so
light
and
unoffensive
i
can
see
how
this
would
be
a
hit
with
people
who
do
not
like
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
diet
carbonated
water
this
beer
is
clearly
the
better
choice
than
the
rival
michelob
ultra
imo
it
tastes
better
that
isnt
saying
much
and
is
less
expensive
as
well
as
less
calories
d
drinkable
but
nothing
special
drinkability
i
wouldnt
say
that
this
is
a
good
beer
by
any
means
but
it
doesnt
suck
so
i
guess
thats
something
drinkability
simply
dreadful
why
its
nothing
more
than
a
lightly
spritzy
corn
tonic
this
is
pretty
much
intolerable
possibly
used
to
say
youre
drinking
beer
but
not
actually
interested
in
taste
or
trying
not
to
get
buzzed
at
a
party
this
was
given
to
me
at
a
miller
sponsered
event
that
i
won
while
the
redwings
game
was
fun
im
actually
sad
i
was
exposed
to
the
beers
offered
so
much
for
a
slimmer
waist
line
okay
a
somewhat
positive
review
of
a
beer
was
a
clear
yellow
color
very
light
in
nature
with
a
very
small
head
the
smell
was
of
really
nothing
mabye
corn
the
taste
has
the
faintest
little
bite
at
the
end
cant
really
tell
what
maybe
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
carbonated
you
barely
feel
like
you
are
drinking
anything
overall
there
is
nothing
awful
about
the
beer
but
it
really
isnt
beer
it
nothing
i
get
the
point
but
why
bother
overall
this
is
for
the
women
looking
to
preserve
their
figures
and
not
get
fat
from
drinking
tasty
beer
i
will
never
drink
this
again
unless
bart
gets
me
another
one
by
pure
accident
drinkability
is
not
impressive
to
me
if
your
looking
for
flavor
its
not
here
but
if
your
looking
for
something
that
can
be
downed
in
large
quantities
then
i
think
this
would
be
for
you
just
nothing
impressive
pale
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
foamy
head
i
dont
really
get
much
on
aroma
the
taste
is
faint
graininess
i
know
this
isnt
the
most
tastiest
flavorful
beerbut
it
fits
well
in
the
light
lager
category
i
would
buy
again
and
recommend
for
summer
outings
doverall
a
good
drinkable
light
beer
perfect
for
tailgates
and
bbqs
on
a
hot
day
i
wont
buy
a
whole
lot
of
it
but
its
a
nice
standby
for
outtingsparties
a
decent
light
beer
overall
if
you
are
watching
your
waste
or
a
girl
this
is
the
beer
for
you
but
in
my
opinion
i
will
stick
to
my
heavier
beers
but
i
wont
bash
anyone
that
chooses
to
drink
this
because
we
all
have
are
own
opinions
on
what
is
good
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
thats
all
that
can
be
said
about
this
also
if
you
must
drink
this
get
it
in
the
can
and
put
the
cans
in
your
freezer
before
opening
them
then
at
least
it
is
icy
when
it
goes
down
because
there
is
no
taste
to
hide
drinking
it
out
of
the
glass
is
less
enjoyable
than
chugging
from
the
can
d
hard
to
argue
that
this
beer
would
be
bad
after
mowing
your
lawn
on
a
hot
day
as
long
as
that
lawn
was
the
size
of
a
football
field
and
you
had
absolutely
nothing
else
to
drink
proof
that
alcohol
counts
when
brewing
beer
it
actually
tastes
worse
than
many
nonalcoholic
brews
too
light
and
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
no
thanks
tm
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
and
the
taste
is
rather
corny
and
bland
nothing
much
here
but
it
is
only
64
calories
drinkability
i
have
to
be
fair
and
say
that
the
drinkability
has
to
be
higher
then
the
other
categories
because
to
be
honest
what
would
you
rate
water
and
thats
basically
what
this
this
beer
has
been
actually
really
taking
off
because
basically
people
just
want
to
be
able
to
drink
and
not
feel
bad
about
calories
and
gaining
weight
but
really
just
not
worth
personally
if
im
gonna
resort
to
drinking
this
id
rather
have
a
diet
soda
to
be
honest
not
gross
but
blah
mgd
64
should
of
came
up
with
a
more
honest
name
for
their
product
hmmmm
let
me
think
miller
genuine
draft
water
flavored
beer
64
yea
that
sounds
more
like
it
i
goes
down
like
water
but
if
i
had
too
many
id
pee
the
bed
seriously
though
if
you
only
want
64
calories
of
beer
drink
2
oz
of
world
wide
stout
i
would
recommend
drinking
less
of
a
better
quality
beer
to
achieve
the
same
means
d
drinikability
is
average
or
a
shade
lower
the
beer
is
easy
enough
to
drink
but
the
lack
of
aroma
flavor
and
complexity
on
any
level
just
takes
away
from
the
enjoyment
too
much
i
guess
you
could
say
im
surprised
at
the
amount
of
flavor
mb
was
able
to
wring
out
of
the
64
brew
but
it
still
just
comes
up
short
in
my
book
worth
a
try
just
for
the
experience
overall
its
not
something
im
going
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
its
in
heavy
rotation
where
i
come
from
so
i
swallow
one
every
now
and
then
trying
to
lose
weight
and
still
have
a
few
beers
on
a
hot
day
as
good
as
any
other
macro
swill
i
guess
better
than
budweiser
good
for
lawn
cutting
day
and
slamming
it
down
at
the
beach
where
you
dont
want
a
heavy
brew
and
high
abv
cant
really
seriously
rate
this
any
deeper
than
this
but
it
does
serve
a
purpose
with
64
calories
and
low
carbs
i
came
into
this
travesty
with
an
open
mind
but
even
bad
beer
tastes
like
beer
in
some
way
mgd
64
doesnt
even
try
to
taste
like
beer
drinkability
its
drinkable
in
that
you
can
throw
back
15
without
getting
that
drunk
but
that
actually
hurts
the
drinkability
since
you
cant
get
drunk
enough
quick
enough
to
not
care
about
horrid
taste
drinkablity
no
thank
you
not
again
be
careful
what
you
drink
at
memorial

get

d
light

you
might
as
well
drink
water
since
youll
get
the
same
flavour
profile
millers
answer
to
the
pallid
nature
of
michelob
ultra
i
guess
overall
quite
watery
and
wimpy
not
that
offensive
in
taste
but
not
worthwhile
one
of
the
easiest
beers
to
drink
ever
it
goes
down
like
nothing
because
it
kinda
is
nothing
its
whole
marketing
campaign
paints
as
a
healthy
lowcalorie
beer
unfortunately
this
leads
to
not
much
taste
although
what
is
there
is
average
not
awful
pretty
unremarkable
beer
but
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
are
health
conscious
or
wanting
a
great
many
because
it
does
go
down
really
easy
i
guess
if
you
are
health
conscious
you
wouldnt
drink
all
that
much
haha
mouthfeeldrinkability
at
least
the
texture
is
nice
a
tad
sharp
and
prickly
for
the
first
millisecond
but
then
its
quick
and
tight
staying
frothy
and
active
while
in
the
mouth
as
with
yeungling
light
which
i
tried
for
the
first
time
last
week
this
could
be
phenomenally
satisfying
in
the
dead
of
summers
heat
quenching
ones
thirst
while
playing
beach
volleyball
or
something
just
dont
expect
anything
in
the
way
of
taste
they
left

part
out
thin
weak

d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
was
designed
to
be
a
refreshing
nonintimidating
beer
there
are
those
who
will
be
offended
by
this
flavor
i
dont
mind
it
i
guess
i
am
one
of
the
few
people
that
can
appreciate
a
super
cheap
light
mass
produced
macro
as
well
as
something
like
ruination
or
old
rasputin
well
this
is
light
but
im
trying
to
figure
out
where
the
beer
part
went
better
to
review
it
just
to
remind
you
of
what
good
beer
tastes
like
64
calories
for
every
mgd
64
you
drink
or
0
calories
for
all
the
mgd
64s
you
dont
drink
if
youre
drinking
a
beer
solely
because
it
only
has
64
calories
just
dont
drink
beer
then
if
you
want
a
real
beer
try
something
else

one
might
as
well
be
drinking
water
there
is
just
a
teeny
bit
of
tingle
and
could
finish
seltzer
water
okay
this
one
maybe
a
diet
beer
if
i
ever
felt
the
need
to
loose
weight
overall
it
was
not
as
watered
down
as
i
thought
it
was
although
it
was
still
very
watered
down
i
guess
it
could
be
a
good
beer
for
getting
really
drunk
if
you
are
a
fat
person
drinkability
is
average
for
the
style
no
off
flavors
and
not
much
flavor
at
all
overall
though
a
good
choice
for
a
light
beer
would
rather
have
this
than
bud
light
or
coors
light
for
instance
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
i
tried
this
while
at
the
inlaws
beer
pours
a
very
pale
straw
golden
color
with
a
wispy
head
not
unpleasant
to
look
at
the
aroma
is
very
light
with
a
distinct
cooked
corn
characteristic
essentially
void
of
flavor
what
is
present
is
generic
malt
and
corn
a
ghost
of
bitterness
but
practically
none
light
on
the
palate
if
you
are
into
beer
with
flavor
i
would
not
recommend
this
for
a
cheap
sessionable
brew
this
is
not
the
one
go
for
a
high
life
light
instead
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
i
will
say
if
you
are
watching
your
calorie
intake
this
may
be
the
way
to
go
actually
one
of
millers
better
offerings
drinkability
for
me
low
calorie
low
alcohol
low
flavor
beers
arent
drinkable
why
even
bother
it
did
help
wash
down
some
homemade
chex
mix
pretty
quickly
not
worth
buying
no
good
for
me
sorry
mgd
64
its
like
a
light
beer
in
a
can
but
it
tastes
like
its
straight
from
the
tap
true
but
only
if
the
tap
is
connected
to
the
urinal
in
the
mens
room
pours
very
light
yellow
with
the
same
big
head
faint
aroma
more
metal
and
corn
than
the
corn
syrup
nightmare
of
the
regular
mgd
cornsyrup
flavor
but
with
lots
of
mineral
water
yum
this
is
a
new
low
in
the
ultra
mega
light
beer
world
putrid
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
very
faint
small
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of

saazlike
hops
in
the
taste
a
small
maltiness
but
really
no
flavor
at
all
a
clean
and
light
or
lite
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
to
a
clean
aftertaste
seriously
what
was
the
point
brewed
for
the
masses
and
for
the
people
who
really
dont
like
beer
miller
genuine
draft
light
64
is
as
inoffensive
to
drink
as
it
is
offensive
to
the
craft
beer
drinkers
sensibilities
so
bmc
how
low
can
you
go
it
seems
to
me
that
theyve
now
sunk
more
than
low
enough
with
the
release
of
this
glorified
seltzer
water
drank
as
opposed
to
tasted
on
111008
cheers
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
along
with
appearance
would
be
its
strengths
sad
thing
was
with
my
mexican
food
i
actually
drank
this
beer
fairly
fast
it
wasnt
offensive
just
lacked
almost
everything
they
ruined
a
great
light
beer
and
made
it
this
shame
on
miller
poured
into
a
pint
glass
barely
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
surprisingly
decent
sized
head
at
first
smelled
nothing
like
beer
to
me
though
more
like
dirty
dishwater
so
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
discovered
it
tasted
more
like
clean
dishwater
thin
watery
with
apologies
to
water
and
not
worth
finishing
is
this
really
what
american
macro
beer
has
come
to
beer
that
doesnt
even
taste
like
beer
what
the
hells
the
point
i
had
to
try
this
beer
because
of
all
the
hype
surrounding
it
as
far
as
superdiet
beers
go
i
prefer
becks
lightest
offering
over
this
i
really
wouldnt
even
be
satisfied
with
this
as
a
lawnmower
beer
but
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
i
would
suppose
it
hits
the
mark
just
not
for
me
im
not
one
to
promote
binge
drinking
but
since
i
had
to
buy
a
12
pack
to
try
it
i
may
see
how
many
it
takes
to
catch
a
buzz
if
i
drink
quick
as
the
abv
is
not
listed
its
got
to
be
around
33
5
though
i
have
generally
preferred
the
miller
products
over
anheuserbusch
and
coors
products
so
this
review
will
be
relative
to
comparable
products
released
by
similar
companies
this
beer
pours
with
an
abundance
of
carbonation
above
a
thinlystraw
color
lighter
than
lite
but
not
as
pale
as
michelob
ultra
the
lack
of
protiens
and
meaninful
dextrins
leaves
the
beer
a
touch
fizzy
and
lacking
in
head
retention
past
the
initial
medium
formation
aromas
are
as
partgrain
partmalt
as
any
other
light
lagers
impressive
with
the
low
calorie
sacrifices
flavors
are
much
the
same
with
good
cleanliness
no
apparent
offflavors
but
no
meaninful
complexity
either
texutres
also
recognize
the
fair
malt
base
but
the
grain
astringency
keeps
the
beer
from
gaining
points
on
mouthfeel
finishes
with
the
same
partgrain
partmalt
flavor
that
is
evident
throughout
fleeting
aftertaste
and
waters
quickly
not
a
beer
that
i
would
go
to
often
but
when
i
need
to
quench
a
thirst
not
think
about
the
beer
or
dont
appreciate
paying
5
50
for
an
average
pale
ale
at
the
local
sports
bar
during
the
game
miller
genuine
draft
light
64
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
clear
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
mildly
grainy
typical
industrial
lager
smell
the
flavor
is
mild
sweet
grain
is
present
just
barely
and
thats
about
it
this
one
is
particularly
light
and
lacking
in
flavor
i
am
not
lying
when
i
say
that
mgd
64
resembles
bottled
water
not
a
horrible
beer
in
the
sense
of
tasting
bad
but
definitely
a
bad
beer
in
terms
of
lack
of
taste
i
will
pass
on
this
offering
in
the
future
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
very
high
because
it
is
easy
to
take
down
it
is
almost
too
easy
too
drink
as
i
have
a
feeling
i
know
a
couple
of
people
who
could
drink
a
case
of
these
and
not
feel
a
thing
this
beer
is
a
product
of
board
room
meetings
trying
to
identify
target
markets
that
target
market
is
me
a
beer
drinker
who
wants
to
eat
healthy
and
keep
drinking
beer
without
getting
fat
64
calories
is
what
you
get
and
should
be
the
name
of
the
beer
i
enjoy
miller
high
life
and
consider
it
to
be
a
great
value
but
this
beer
doesnt
come
close
it
has
been
filtered
and
filtered
again
until
nothing
was
left
but
water
alcohol
and
64
calories
this
website
says
it
is
4
7
alcohol
im
finding
that
hard
to
believe
it
cant
be
more
than
2
3
id
buy
it
again
if
it
gave
me
a
buzz
but
it
doesnt
d
full
marks
here
because
quite
frankly
i
could
drink
this
all
night
very
refreshing
and
the
perfect
summer
beer
its
light
crisp
and
doesnt
leave
any
heavy
tastes
on
the
palate
plus
a
person
doesnt
have
to
feel
guilty
about
putting
back
several
with
the
low
calorie
count
and
all
a
great
alternative
to
a
soda
tastes
like
pellegrino
mixed
with
a
splash
of
beer
with
a
funky
and
not
the
good
kind
aftertaste
skip
it
unless
its
left
at
your
party
and
even
then
skip
it
pours
pale
and
fizzy
from
the
can
initially
this
gave
off
a
hydrogen
sulfide
rotten
egg
sort
of
smell
that
was
off
putting
but
not
quite
offensive
enough
to
be
awful
this
smell
gave
way
to
an
odor
that
reminded
me
of
playdough
ive
never
had
that
before
in
a
beer
it
is
faint
so
not
truly
offensive
but
weird
ive
had
two
cans
of
this
stuff
in
the
last
week
and
these
aromas
have
been
present
both
times
so
it
is
not
some
freaky
set
of
circumstances
the
taste
initally
was
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
with
an
emphasis
on
slightly
ultimately
the
taste
is
dominated
by
carbonation
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
what
you
expect
in
a
light
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
something
big
obviously
this
isnt
it
while
it
is
drinkable
even
if
one
grants
consideration
for
the
light
beer
style
guidelines
it
just
fails
to
impress
even
the
gal
said
this
is
no
good
shes
going
back
to
coors
light
oh
my
still
have
work
to
do
anyway
worth
taking
a
dive
into
if
your
looking
for
a
cheap
light
beer
to
stock
the
fridge
with
ok
maybe
thats
a
stretch
but
i
couldnt
resist
thanks
to
wikipedia
personally
i
think
it
needs
at
least
5
more
calories
to
add
some
flavor
and
then
they
could
call
it
miler
genuine
draft
69
then
theyd
be
on
to
something
one
thing
this
beers
has
going
for
it
is
there
is
really
no
flavor
that
is
about
it
though
a
clear
yellow
color
with
the
usual
bad
fizzy
head
no
flavor
or
aroma
besides
the
old
grainy
malts
and
grassy
hops
a
light
fizzy
body
finishes
me
off
this
one
goes
down
the
drain
poured
a
light
yellow
with
a
fair
amount
of
foam
that
dissapated
with
in
a
few
seconds
the
smell
and
aroma
was
very
weak
the
taste
was
also
weak
and
had
sort
of
a
watery
bitterness
while
drinking
it
not
much
difference
between
this
light
lager
and
the
others
they
all
seem
to
be
the
same
drank
this
swill
because
i
was
visiting
a
friend
and
couldnt
be
a
snob
by
turning
him
down
this
beer
was
left
at
my
home
by
one
of
my
wifes
friends
who
is
watching
calories
i
say
why
drink
beer
if
you
are
watching
your
calories
but
that
is
another
story
on
to
the
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
even
though
the
bottle
is
clear
straw
color
with
almost
no
white
head
no
lacing
this
beer
smells
of
some
corn
and
grainy
malt
the
taste
has
a
corn
flavor
carbonation
leaves
an
odd
aftertaste
this
beer
is
too
watered
down
for
its
own
good
not
impressed
but
wasnt
expecting
much
this
is
the
only
beer
that
ive
ever
reviewed
that
i
didnt
pour
into
a
glass
the
bottles
clear
so
screw
it
i
can
see
the
clear
golden
yellow
appearance
and
thin
white
head
maybe
i
could
smell
it
better
if
poured
into
a
glass
seeing
that
i
dont
smell
much
here
it
smells
better
than
some
other
macro
light
beers
that
ive
smelled
although
it
smells
as
if
lesser
fermentables
were
used
in
the
brewing
ive
smelled
worse
pretty
clean
nonbitter
taste
one
of
the
better
macro
light
beers
out
there
but
not
a
very
good
beer
beer
d
this
is
fairly
typical
of
the
style
not
very
satisfying
or
very
tasty
had
this
in
the
can
and
didnt
bother
pouring
it
smell
is
heavyish
not
airy
like
most
light
macros
but
there
really
is
nothing
there
but
some
adjuncts
like
corn
and
maybe
some
barley
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
slick
very
smooth
that
is
because
this
stuff
has
almost
flavor
whatsoever
it
isnt
even
bad
it
is
nondescript
just
nothing
to
note
of
and
the
only
reason
i
drank
this
is
because
my
cheap
beer
buddy
is
on
a
diet
i
shouldve
just
had
a
glass
of
water
very
weak
beerlike
flavor
not
much
else
to
add
a
bit
fizzy
and
light
bodied
i
would
think
it
is
extremely
low
calorie
this
is
a
quantity
over
quality
beer
but
at
its
price
point
i
can
think
of
a
couple
of
other
macro
lagers
i
would
pick
up
instead
of
this
one
right
there
in
the
mich
ltbud
lt
mold
high
on
carbonation
decent
appearance
for
a
light
beer
to
much
corn
in
the
taste
theres
a
twangy
fruit
but
i
think
its
just
sour
corn
head
is
whispy
and
leaves
quickly
crisp
finish
makes
it
quite
drinkable
although
this
beer
is
truly
unremarkable
havent
had
shiner
lt
but
to
me
mich
lt
has
a
slight
edge
on
the
lt
macro
catagory
avoid
unless
its
8
99
or
unless
you
just
want
to
feel
like
youre
saving
calories
drinkability
bad
beer
that
lacks
character
im
kind
of
offended
that
this
beer
is
being
marketed
in
my
hometown
madison
wi
i
think
were
a
little
better
than
that
this
tastes
about
like
every
other
macro
out
there
easytodrink
out
in
the
heat
but
not
much
of
an
experience
enjoy
if
your
short
on
options
d
if
you
drink
it
glacially
cold
you
can
get
away
with
drinking
this
beer
at
a
dive
bar
otherwise
avoid
at
all
costs
oh
yeah
when
i
thought
that
i
could
lose
weight
by
drinking
lite
beers
instead
of
cutting
out
the
processed
food
this
was
a
staple
i
used
to
be
loyal
to
mgd
before
i
knew
what
good
beer
was
and
this
is
just
a
smaller
version
of
mgd
some
corn
adjunct
flavors
and
aromas
are
detectable
if
you
try
really
hard
pale
colorless
tasteless
fizzy
crap
but
it
was
cheap
oh
those
30packs
and
a
frozen
glass
why
didnt
i
just
drink
vodka
if
i
didnt
want
to
taste
anything
yea
this
is
just
about
as
average
as
you
can
get
did
the
michelob
golden
draft
lite
taste
test
and
they
are
just
about
even
what
did
i
expect
you
know
i
just
wish
the
days
of
cases
of
24
returnables
for
7
50
was
still
around
you
found
a
lot
of
friends
that
would
drink
a
lot
of
average
beer
without
one
snide
remark
pours
an
albino
golden
hue
with
pristine
clairity
generating
a
one
and
half
finger
soapy
head
holds
a
very
thin
cap
for
most
of
the
glass
and
surprisingly
it
even
leaves
sticky
waves
of
lacing
cleanish
nose
some
rice
and
other
cereal
adjuncts
are
the
only
noticable
aromas
scrubbed
pale
lager
malt
and
tannic
adjunct
tastevery
light
with
no
hop
flavor
anywhere
a
suggestion
of
hop
extract
bitterness
balances
the
very
delicate
flavor
and
the
aftertaste
dries
away
to
blankness
almost
instantly
crisp
and
sharp
carbonation
and
seltzery
body
quite
effervescent
the
drinkability
could
be
called
excellent
since
a
few
seconds
after
taking
a
sip
you
could
easily
forget
you
were
having
a
beer
a
good
attmept
at
tasting
like
nothing
drinkability
its
okay
as
long
as
you
dont
tip
the
glass
to
your
mouth
expecting
to
taste
beer
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
something
i
would
buy
again
though
try
with
mexican
beer
enchiladas
tacos
de
trompo
and
green
sauce
chicharron
45
recommended
d
there
is
no
malt
flavor
and
no
real
hop
flavor
it
is
not
to
interesting
and
i
would
rather
drink
water
i
guess
the
best
thing
you
could
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
has
a
little
more
favor
than
miller
light
of
course
thats
not
hard
to
do
since
miller
light
is
basically
bottled
water
with
some
alcohol
in
it
one
should
only
drink
this
beer
in
high
school
when
they
want
the
girls
to
think
theyre
a
rebel
because
they
dont
drink
light
beers
for
a
light
beer
this
isnt
too
bad
clear
morning
urine
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
white
film
mild
aroma
of
sweet
grain
and
corn
tastes
slightly
of
corn
and
cereal
grains
with
a
minimal
amount
of
hop
bittering
mouthfeel
is
light
and
sweet
finish
is
crisp
from
the
carbonation
and
mildly
acidic
drinkability
is
better
than
most
in
the
category
not
repulsive
in
any
way
some
many
macro
lights
are
just
not
much
going
on
d
big
gulps
are
key
here
doggone
good
for
a
light
brew
in
my
humble
opinion
the
lighter
version
of
mgd
and
it
shows
very
similar
except
the
corn
flavors
and
grainy
bitterness
are
mellowed
down
body
is
light
but
more
crisp
than
i
would
have
expected
theres
a
bit
less
smoothness
to
this
than
the
millerbudcoors
lights
but
that
might
not
be
such
a
bad
thing
corn
flavors
are
obvious
and
some
bitterness
from
either
the
grains
or
hops
im
not
sure
finish
is
a
bit
acidic
to
go
with
the
crispness
i
actually
prefer
this
to
most
of
the
other
macro
lights
but
its
still
not
a
good
beer
at
least
is
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tried
and
this
light
version
is
better
than
the
regular
one
yes
i
do
not
know
why
but
it
is
a
rare
event
with
this
i
actually
had
a
good
chat
a
little
annoying
the
beer
but
was
not
trying
to
make
me
puke
like
the
previous
one
i
had
from
this
brewery
this
review
is
for
miller
genuine
draft
light
after
pizza
diner
drinking
guinness
and
hacker
pschorr
weiss
beer
i
had
to
grab
something
for
fireside
chat
with
my
family
at
a
small
store
well
it
turned
out
aok
this
beer
will
not
win
many
awards
but
i
found
it
to
be
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
without
the
feeling
i
was
not
actually
drinking
beer
decent
light
beer
i
must
admit
actually
damn
close
to
amstel
light
in
quality
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
adequate
longlasting
white
head
smell
is
very
minimal
with
only
some
slight
sweetness
noted
taste
follows
the
smell
being
very
light
but
refreshing
finish
is
refreshing
but
lacks
any
malt
or
hop
taste
good
spacer
as
far
as
light
american
macrobrew
beers
go
i
would
rate
this
beer
as
decent
this
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
no
head
and
has
a
cereal
grain
scent
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
great
cold
on
a
hot
day
where
you
dont
want
too
much
alcohol
or
too
much
aftertaste
drinability
no
taste
and
no
soul
but
such
a
drinkable
beer
great
for
tailgating
better
than
its
full
flavored
brother
pours
out
to
a
medium
golden
color
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
short
lived
white
foamy
head
notes
of
alcohol
hops
and
corn
were
observed
on
the
inital
aroma
although
a
bread
like
scent
was
also
noted
half
way
through
flavor
is
mostly
water
and
corn
but
i
can
see
how
this
could
been
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
it
was
really
cold
and
there
was
nothing
else
finished
weakly
with
the
lingering
taste
of
zinc
or
steel
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
not
a
terrible
brew
but
not
wonderful
either
worth
a
try
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
the
beer
did
have
decent
zippy
carbonation
drinkablity
is
a
tougher
call
it
is
easy
drinking
and
better
than
bud
or
miller
lite
but
still
a
yawner
the
beer
leaves
the
12ounce
clear
bottle
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
modest
frothy
bright
white
head
with
the
residual
lace
a
thin
sheet
nose
is
malt
fresh
and
crisp
the
start
sweet
with
a
light
grain
profile
and
the
top
skinny
in
feel
finish
is
brisk
in
its
acidity
the
hops
light
and
the
aftertaste
dry
one
of
the
most
common
beers
on
the
market
today
first
of
all
the
the
thing
that
kills
me
has
occasionally
made
me
cry
being
here
in
germany
any
one
can
imagine
all
the
delectable
brews
on
the
menu
saying
this
it
only
makes
me
think
down
on
alot
of
beer
drinkers
or
should
i
say
havent
got
a
clue
about
beer
and
drink
what
ever
they
had
laying
around
the
trailer
on
the
other
hand
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
will
produce
a
good
taste
tenderize
or
put
a
zip
on
any
meal
that
you
are
cooking
i
actually
sent
my
wife
to
the
store
to
buy
it
because
i
didnt
want
anyone
actually
seeing
me
buy
it
all
this
aside
the
beer
can
chicken
that
this
produces
is
mouth
watering
the
bratwurst
are
to
die
for
and
dont
get
me
started
on
the
beer
battering
the
3
bucks
a
six
pack
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
oh
ya
it
foams
alot
when
i
poor
it
in
the
pan
and
even
more
when
i
poor
it
in
the
flour
for
the
batter
and
i
allways
get
my
gasmask
out
to
keep
the
smell
out
of
my
nose
i
would
never
punish
my
senses
like
that
so
i
am
not
sure
of
the
taste
or
the
mouthfeel
first
off
i
hate
the
bottles
these
beers
come
in
clear
bottle
where
you
see
a
beer
that
turns
you
off
very
straw
yellow
when
poured
color
remains
very
strawpiss
yellow
with
no
head
just
glass
lacing
on
the
top
the
smell
is
very
strong
of
grain
and
corn
not
very
lager
smelling
taste
is
very
watered
down
with
a
hop
taste
in
the
rear
very
light
and
dull
in
the
mouth
drinkable
because
it
is
so
light
but
will
never
be
in
my
fridge
straw
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
very
grainy
with
a
little
malt
taste
is
almost
vacant
after
having
a
couple
spiced
winter
brews
tonightthis
stuff
is
closer
to
water
than
beer
i
can
sense
a
little
corn
and
malt
but
not
much
not
offensive
but
not
good
by
any
means
typical
american
beer
pours
a
light
golden
colour
and
has
a
snow
white
head
delicate
lacing
and
has
the
smell
of
most
american
beer
light
to
moderate
yeasty
bready
smell
a
wee
bit
sweeter
than
most
other
american
beers
and
far
more
palatable
than
bud
light
if
i
may
be
perimetted
to
say
the
b
word
mgd
light
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
great
inexpensive
brew
to
enjoy
in
breaks
while
doing
lawn
work
i
have
found
the
above
to
hold
true
with
most
products
from
miller
brewing
company
one
thing
i
particularly
like
about
this
brew
is
that
is
has
a
light
crackerbiscuit
after
taste
i
had
originally
given
this
one
3
0
in
all
categories
as
in
free
beer
pegasusmay
19
thin
with
no
staying
power
and
a
little
light
lacing
i
kept
trying
to
grasp
the
taste
and
it
never
improves
note
to
self
quit
trying
this
on
any
occasion
overtones
of
corn
with
the
funky
aftertaste
just
mentioned
procsep
09
but
its
close
very
pale
water
wow
an
even
liter
version
of
mgd
why
pours
a
pale
yellow
hydrated
urine
color
just
like
most
aals
very
little
head
without
an
aggressive
pour
and
even
the
head
you
do
get
is
wasted
beer
no
lacing
or
head
retention
to
speak
of
smells
like
metal
shavings
and
a
bit
of
hay
tastes
like
it
looks
hydrated
urine
finishes
heavily
carbonated
terrible
beer
absolutely
terrible
not
recommended
this
pours
a
light
clear
golden
with
small
white
head
aroma
of
nasty
corn
and
hay
skunk
flavor
followsif
you
can
call
it
flavorwith
watered
down
hay
and
a
finish
that
can
only
be
described
by
me
as
vomit
the
mouthfeel
is
of
course
light
with
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
mostly
inoffensive
until
it
finishes
where
it
seriously
induces
gagging
from
me
not
sure
what
it
is
about
this
one
but
i
avoid
at
all
costs
im
not
sure
i
would
call
this
beer
maybe
beer
flavored
water
i
would
normally
write
a
review
with
more
of
a
description
of
the
beer
but
i
dont
think
this
beer
deserves
such
a
write
up
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
appearance
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
and
this
is
the
thinnest
wateriest
beer
i
have
had
since
trying
low
alcohol
beers
with
a
beer
like
this
what
is
the
point
you
may
as
well
have
a
glass
of
water
tastes
like
water
almost
no
alcohol
content
it
was
pretty
cheap
at
9
for
a
12er
of
bottles
but
it
is
a
pointless
buy
unless
maybe
your
dd
wants
to
have
a
few
drinks
i
certainly
will
not
buy
this
ever
again
in
fact
im
heading
out
now
to
the
liquor
store
to
pick
up
something
different
right
now
this
is
beer
its
more
like
a
lightly
flavored
water
thin
watery
mouthfeel
with
basically
no
taste
this
stuff
is
far
on
the
fringe
of
what
i
am
willing
to
call
beer
everything
that
makes
it
beer
has
been
removed
to
get
the
calorie
count
down
taste
is
missing
in
action
watery
bland
overall
a
nonbeer
may
be
mistook
for
grape
soda
due
to
the
ridiculous
purple
can
thats
how
they
trick
you
into
accidentally
drinking
it
for
the
record
fav
beers
are
alaskan
amber
and
wisconsin
brewerys
porter
joe
overall
when
you
gaze
long
into
an
abyss
the
abyss
gazes
also
into
you
nietzsche
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
lookswise
this
one
isnt
so
bad
i
must
say
smell
is
of
subtle
grain
sugar
and
metal
there
is
also
a
weird
fruitiness
that
i
am
picking
up
in
the
smell
taste
is
of
sugary
water
and
slight
grain
flavors
this
beer
seems
to
be
quite
flat
with
a
watery
quality
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
horrible
beer
any
way
you
look
at
it
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
can
to
try
just
so
i
can
further
appreciate
all
the
good
beer
i
am
able
to
enjoy
o
contrary
to
what
they
believe
it
is
a
never
a
good
time
overall
its
not
too
offensive
to
drink
which
gives
a
1
5
but
just
barely
easy
drinking
thirst
quenching
beer
great
for
parties
if
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
especially
for
a
low
price
nothing
really
offensive
but
nothing
good
2
it
has
alcohol
possibly
unrefined
ethonol
so
if
you
drink
enough
of
it
you
might
forget
youre
drinking
beer30
light
and
just
choke
on
your
own
vomit
and
die
o
really
terrible
good
to
know
about
for
bets
worst
beer
and
party
tricks
make
someone
vomit
do
if
they
could
get
rid
of
that
offputting
taste
at
the
end
of
each
gulp
this
could
be
a
winner
read
average
as
it
stands
now
the
best
thing
i
took
out
of
this
24
ouncer
was
a
can
tick
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
o
why
just
why
spend
the
extra
money
and
get
pbr
budweiser
landshark
anything
other
than
this
1
5
overall
the
beer
is
what
you
pay
for
it
wouldnt
mind
spending
the
few
extra
dollars
for
budlight
though
my
friend
and
i
bought
this
as
a
joke
we
paid
9
99
for
30
beers
so
we
knew
it
would
not
be
good
this
beer
taste
like
water
with
some
grape
flavoring
in
it
it
also
tasted
like
tap
water
i
did
not
bother
pouring
it
into
a
glass
but
i
imagine
it
would
have
poured
almost
clear
there
is
nothing
good
about
this
beer
unless
you
just
want
to
get
buzzed
for
cheap
or
are
having
people
over
you
dont
like
avoid
this
beer
it
is
not
worth
the
10
i
spent
can
graciously
shared
at
the
july
santa
cruz
tasting
pours
a
sickly
yellowish
straw
color
evoking
images
of
corn
cob
aged
hose
water
with
a
sputtering
gray
head
it
could
be
power
of
suggestion
with
the
laughable
purple
can
or
it
could
be
a
really
weird
gross
fermentation
but
im
getting
some
distinct
grape
notes
on
the
nose
beyond
that
maybe
some
rotting
grains
flavor
thankfully
eases
up
on
the
fruit
solvent
and
retreats
into
your
basic
dirty
pale
lager
with
dusty
corny
grains
and
a
vanishing
unsavory
finish
carbonation
is
surprisingly
low
for
the
style
giving
a
tap
watery
impression
no
reason
to
ever
drink
this
even
for
free
well
the
tick
is
worth
it
odthe
only
good
part
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
the
cheapest
thirty
i
have
seen
in
ma
it
ran
about
13
and
i
respect
the
gimmick
theyre
going
for
here
really
gross
but
hey
its
cheap
and
eventually
gets
the
job
done
eventually
o
somehow
worse
than
beer
30
ice
i
need
to
set
up
a
trade
with
woodychandler
maybe
he
can
help
me
out
here
not
impressed
with
this
one
way
too
sweet
and
all
around
strange
right
down
to
the
purple
can
with
a
drawing
of
disembodied
arm
on
it
o
the
price
is
right
for
a
quantity
over
quality
beer
rjt
overall
not
hard
to
put
back
i
dont
know
really
if
i
was
taking
huge
gulps
because
it
was
easy
or
i
was
ready
to
move
on
to
a
kbs
or
something
can
purchased
for
sixty
cents
poured
into
a
goblet
felt
nearly
aristocratic
pouring
it
into
the
goblet
pours
fairly
deep
gold
more
color
than
a
typical
light
beer
and
decent
head
for
one
too
looking
good
though
what
doesnt
in
this
goblet
the
nose
also
has
a
bit
more
to
it
than
the
superlight
beers
of
today
nothing
bad
though
maybe
a
bit
of
honey
malt
and
a
bit
of
a
savory
contrast
tastes
like
apple
cider
low
to
moderate
bitterness
on
the
midpalate
and
a
chlorinated
coppery
finish
actually
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
victoria
bitter
note
to
ozzies
in
the
usa
honestly
this
is
pretty
inoffensive
though
the
flavors
dont
scream
stereotypical
american
light
beer
at
me
nicely
carbonated
with
decent
body
too
seems
like
people
love
to
hate
on
this
but
it
is
actually
pretty
palatable
for
a
light
lager
worth
buying
if
not
just
to
constantly
ask
people
what
time
it
is
and
wait
for
them
to
respond
beer
30
you
might
want
to
buy
one
though
just
to
display
that
silly
name
can
in
your
bar
d
almost
no
flavor
at
all
goes
down
easily
and
is
not
too
filling
since
there
isnt
much
to
it
very
mild
kick
i
dont
see
how
they
can
honestly
call
this
premium
beer
on
the
can
when
it
barely
passes
for
beer
at
all
thanks
to
my
buddy
and
his
iowa
citybased
alma
mater
i
now
have
a
case
o
this
yeah
it
pours
a
clear
deep
sallow
topped
by
a
rather
shortlived
bit
o
fizzy
white
foam
the
nose
is
nearly
as
devoid
of
scent
as
the
surface
of
the
moon
since
according
to
my
research
the
moons
not
really
made
of
cheese
seriously
when
did
this
happen
i
figure
its
pretty
scentless
with
only
some
mild
corn
chaff
finding
its
way
into
the
strils
the
taste
doesnt
try
too
hard
to
oneup
the
smell
though
a
very
mild
sweetness
vainly
tries
to
pervade
the
otherwise
tasteless
liquid
as
my
boy
filbert
once
said
this
thing
went
down
like
a
lead
rake
interestingly
the
body
is
very
light
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
so
i
guess
its
more
apt
to
say
it
went
down
too
easily
like
a
lead
rake
why
not
overall
i
really
dont
want
to
drink
this
its
not
that
its
completely
offensive
per
se
but
its
not
a
flavor
of
water
i
really
want
to
have
much
of
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
hope
the
clock
never
strikes
beer30
so
long
as
it
means
this
brew
is
in
the
offing
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
foam
wait
nevermind
the
foam
is
gone
the
smell
is
faint
and
almost
nothing
which
i
would
have
thought
good
but
as
it
turns
out
there
is
a
corn
adjunct
smell
that
i
dont
ever
like
to
smell
in
addition
i
think
there
is
soap
its
not
offensive
but
its
not
good
either
the
taste
is
in
that
not
good
range
it
is
definitely
made
with
rice
because
this
tastes
of
malt
and
cheap
sake
i
think
that
i
taste
the
soap
as
well
theres
also
that
weak
apple
core
taste
as
well
not
great
its
ok
on
the
palate
the
watery
flavor
isnt
good
but
i
suppose
its
better
than
the
opposite
its
drinkable
if
you
want
i
dont
want
to
avoid
at
all
costs
never
again
not
even
in
the
most
desperate
of
times
overall
avoid
no
redeeming
qualities
whatsoever
yellow
with
oily
white
bubbles
smells
sweet
and
grainy
do
you
know
how
cobra
smells
it
kinda
smells
like
that
but
a
bit
more
muted
not
particularly
refreshing
as
you
would
expect
in
a
light
american
lager
but
kinda
sweet
and
slick
maybe
its
the
silly
jokename
it
has
or
maybe
its
the
fact
that
the
can
reminds
me
of
grape
soda
but
i
think
its
fairly
drinkable
highly
recommended
for
a
middle
class
unique
heavy
partier
cheap
enough
for
beer
pong
yet
good
enough
for
sunday
night
football
the
price
is
right
whether
its
day
or
night
overall
just
a
bad
choice
overall
notes
not
really
all
that
great
of
a
beer
and
shows
that
you
get
what
you
pay
for
ill
probably
stick
to
pbr
or
miller
high
life
for
my
cheap
beer
but
if
you
want
a
bit
more
of
a
fruitiness
in
your
cheap
beer
this
may
be
for
you
plus
the
labelname
is
kind
of
funny
got
a
dirty
30
in
madison
i
love
the
purple
can
not
worth
pouring
in
a
glass
really
i
swear
the
purple
can
makes
you
think
its
grape
soda
as
cheap
beers
go
its
ok
10
30
pack
and
decent
drink
it
for
the
novelty
nothing
else
its
no
pbr
but
its
better
than
mountain
creek
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
corn
taste
is
like
water
with
a
touch
of
beer
flavoring
not
much
going
on
at
all
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
there
is
nothing
to
recomend
about
this
beer
this
beer
was
purchased
just
for
the
name
of
it
kind
of
like
a
novelty
we
always
joke
that
we
think
its
beer
thirty
of
course
it
didnt
hurt
we
got
a
30
pack
for
under
12
00
when
we
first
tried
this
beer
we
had
already
had
a
couple
of
other
beers
first
and
didnt
think
it
tasted
too
bad
now
today
as
i
sit
here
drinking
it
on
its
own
without
any
thing
altering
the
pallet
and
i
have
a
completely
different
opinion
of
this
beer
this
beer
reminds
me
of
something
i
would
have
bought
in
college
because
its
all
i
could
afford
as
a
grown
man
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
beer
again
no
matter
how
cheap
it
was
i
must
be
slipping
my
pour
only
produced
a
little
better
than
a
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
with
really
low
retention
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
it
looked
like
sunshine
in
a
glass
as
i
peered
into
the
gloaming
through
my
kitchen
window
the
nose
was
sweet
mostly
cereal
but
also
some
of
that
fruity
bubblegum
oof
mouthfeel
was
fuller
than
i
might
expect
in
a
light
beer
but
that
did
not
help
the
cloyingly
sweet
taste
i
got
on
the
tongue
double
oof
the
finish
left
me
wondering
how
many
more
of
these
kinds
of
beers
i
am
going
to
encounter
on
the
canquest
i
can
only
hope
that
more
craft
brewers
turn
to
cans
in
the
near
future
in
the
mean
time
avoid
pale
yellow
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
of
large
bubbles
that
burned
off
super
fast
with
an
audible
ssss
like
a
burning
fuse
the
nose
is
pure
creamed
corn
with
a
touch
of
band
aid
this
brew
tastes
like
it
costs
cheap
as
hell
and
hard
to
choke
down
cooked
corn
is
the
main
flavor
here
light
and
highly
carbonated
a
pretty
bad
beer
drinkability
thank
god
i
only
bought
two
cans
one
of
the
worst
dollars
i
ever
spent
even
though
it
was
only
a
buck
i
am
seriously
thinking
about
going
back
to
that
liquor
store
in
shelbyville
kentucky
and
getting
my
money
back
this
beer
is
downright
criminal
feels
kind
of
like
tap
water
which
is
appropriate
because
like
tap
water
this
is
going
down
the
drain
overall
i
was
given
this
can
of
beer
and
was
told
to
go
home
and
give
it
a
try
this
beer
is
nothing
special
and
not
very
easy
to
drink
unless
youve
had
a
couple
shots
of
hard
alcohol
if
you
noticed
i
gave
this
beer
all
ones
in
the
spirt
of
being
fair
while
rating
beer
i
never
like
to
give
the
extremes
for
example
i
would
never
give
a
beer
5s
across
the
board
because
that
would
mean
that
beer
was
perfect
in
every
way
this
beer
is
however
perfectly
awful
take
everything
you
like
about
your
favorite
beer
and
reverse
it
im
not
trying
to
beer
bash
but
this
was
at
a
party
once
and
people
were
fighting
over
who
got
the
luxury
of
drinking
natural
light
this
is
the
lowest
of
the
low
no
head
flavor
aroma
mouthfeel
was
terrible
carbonated
water
almost
made
me
cry
just
no
no
dale
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
anyone
who
likes
beer
that
tastes
very
bad
well
enjoy
super
fizzy
mouthfeel
with
a
light
body
easy
drinking
but
not
because
its
so
fruity
oh
and
it
should
also
work
on
the
mournful
dispepsia
it
causes
and
the
headache
this
beer
came
in
a
variety
6
pack
of
shiner
and
i
wish
they
would
put
something
better
this
beer
is
very
bland
and
boring
i
poured
it
out
and
it
was
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
medium
head
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
wheat
the
taste
is
pretty
watery
to
me
it
has
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
thats
really
it
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
average
it
is
pretty
crisp
and
a
bot
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
not
that
good
i
do
not
really
care
for
light
beers
and
this
didnt
help
change
my
views
overall
impression
doesnt
look
like
much
and
kinda
flattish
but
definitely
a
solid
choice
for
the
style
i
may
give
this
one
another
shot
sometime
and
see
if
a
better
cap
seal
improves
things
this
review
is
short
and
sweet
this
is
a
typical
light
beer
with
some
more
flavor
if
you
dont
like
lights
dont
drink
this
one
its
no
different
nice
look
with
a
puffy
white
head
smell
is
sort
of
malty
and
sweet
mild
malt
flavor
kind
of
like
corn
decent
carbonation
and
very
very
smooth
and
drinkable
low
abv
and
the
of
shinerespecially
the
variety
pack
make
for
a
good
choice
for
macro
drinkers
to
jump
into
the
world
of
craft
brewing
most
of
shiner
beers
are
not
too
over
the
top
and
this
is
no
exception
good
beer
spoetzl
brewery
probably
one
of
the
better
light
beers
ive
had
pours
a
plae
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
as
the
slight
scent
of
malts
tickle
your
nose
upon
drinking
there
is
complex
malt
taste
which
leaves
the
beer
weaker
in
taste
but
still
has
a
rather
indepth
texture
to
it
that
finishes
rather
smooth
something
better
to
try
than
the
ol
miller
lite
and
bud
light
d
4
5
overall
a
typical
lager
very
macro
like
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
easy
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
thats
about
it
i
dont
like
light
beer
but
this
is
better
than
coors
light
bud
light
busch
light
and
any
other
light
beer
ive
tried
lighter
abv
4
0
than
the
before
mentioned
consequently
a
bit
smoother
cant
give
drinkability
a
higher
score
as
i
got
it
in
a
shiner
family
multipack
there4
havent
drunk
it
enough
to
know
how
drinking
it
as
a
session
beer
would
affect
me
overall
its
ok
to
drink
and
at
4abv
not
a
problem
there
fairly
good
a
little
too
dry
but
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
notes
for
a
light
lager
this
one
is
not
bad
at
all
just
a
little
boring
but
so
is
the
style
really
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
grain
with
nothing
else
being
present
the
flavor
is
better
than
the
aroma
but
is
still
nothing
special
i
get
some
grain
and
wheat
as
well
as
some
sweet
malt
and
some
grassy
hops
medium
carbonation
and
light
mouthfeel
not
terrible
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
unless
you
really
like
light
lagers
like
washing
down
a
piece
of
white
bread
with
mineral
water
d
watery
very
drinkable
thats
its
best
attribute
scores
are
per
style
would
drink
this
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
wont
be
buying
this
stuff
notes
i
may
come
off
a
bit
critical
here
but
i
do
think
they
hit
on
the
style
just
fine
its
quite
refreshing
but
really
just
tastes
like
a
light
malty
carbonated
soda
in
my
opinion
still
its
definitely
better
than
some
of
the
standard
offerings
for
the
style
best
light
beer
ive
had
so
far
give
it
a
try
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
beer
for
a
light
beer
this
is
pretty
impressive
keep
it
on
the
cold
side
rates
high
within
its
style
its
clean
with
good
carbonation
but
im
going
to
have
to
take
the
calories
over
this
bland
d
could
probably
sit
around
and
drink
these
one
after
another
but
dont
know
why
id
choose
to
do
that
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
normally
when
you
see
light
on
a
beers
label
you
anticipate
it
to
be
a
shadow
of
anything
good
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
this
beer
is
wellworth
pounding
down
for
a
long
time
poured
from
a
bottle
in
a
mixed
six
pack
into
my
favorite
pint
glass
the
light
straw
color
and
one
inch
head
was
pretty
nice
for
a
light
brew
smell
was
bright
with
not
much
offensive
typical
adjunct
smell
taste
was
right
down
the
middle
as
well
mouthfeel
was
light
and
drinkability
was
there
all
in
all
not
bad
for
a
light
lawnmower
quality
for
sure
drinkability
a
surprisingly
decent
light
beer
while
certainly
not
a
standout
in
any
way
this
beer
is
pretty
refreshing
and
really
drinkable
you
could
do
far
far
worse
in
a
light
beer
d
easily
could
drink
a
lot
more
than
one
if
not
for
the
diacetyl
flavor
this
would
be
a
decent
beer
unfortunately
the
predominant
flavor
shouldnt
really
be
the
show
stealer
it
is
better
than
budlight
i
would
drink
it
again
but
its
not
as
cheap
as
budlight
d
for
the
style
this
is
pretty
good
im
not
going
to
reach
for
it
over
any
other
shiner
but
if
im
specifically
looking
for
a
light
beer
id
choose
this
over
the
usual
suspects
honestly
i
should
probably
rate
it
higher
just
because
i
dont
know
where
it
could
pick
up
points
and
still
be
in
style
drinkability
not
too
impressed
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
this
is
the
one
thus
far
in
my
experience
to
drink
if
you
must
have
a
light
beer
a
decent
light
beer
notes
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
im
surprised
its
as
good
as
it
is
with
the
light
label
and
everything
trying
to
diet
by
drinking
crappier
beer
just
isnt
worth
it
but
if
you
feel
the
need
to
do
so
anyway
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
now
if
only
they
could
make
a
glutenfree
beer
that
was
as
good
drinkability
is
an
easygoing
affair
but
theres
not
much
here
to
keep
ones
attention
pours
a
clear
goldencopper
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
yeast
grain
and
slight
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
light
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
yeast
hops
and
slight
wheat
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
light
lagers
ive
ever
had
good
flavor
nice
blend
and
easy
drinkability
verdict
this
is
still
a
step
albeit
not
a
massive
one
up
from
budmillercoors
light
despite
being
pretty
bland
and
boring
i
still
think
this
beer
still
serves
its
purpose
texans
used
to
the
normal
light
beers
arent
going
to
be
scared
off
by
this
and
hopefully
theyll
start
exploring
the
rest
of
the
shiner
line
and
beyond
drinkability
this
gets
a
five
for
being
a
great
light
beer
its
drinkable
and
refreshing
enough
to
pass
for
a
light
lager
but
doesnt
compromise
too
much
on
flavor
this
is
a
beer
that
shouldnt
be
ignored
simply
because
it
says
light
on
the
label
and
is
well
worth
a
shot
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
in
the
glass
the
smell
isnt
too
appealing
some
very
sweet
honey
malt
aromas
but
it
resembles
a
stale
beer
on
a
bar
room
floor
type
smell
taste
is
ok
it
starts
off
with
a
good
sweet
malt
flavor
and
then
finishes
with
some
earthy
hop
flavors
very
simple
flavors
and
well
balanced
i
kept
getting
some
metallic
tang
tastes
not
on
every
sip
so
it
might
just
be
me
carbonation
is
a
little
too
high
sound
like
pop
rocks
are
going
off
if
you
hold
a
sip
in
your
mouth
drinkability
is
good
the
taste
falls
somewhere
in
between
that
caramel
corn
that
comes
in
those
bigass
tins
at
christmas
time
and
some
burnt
white
bread
toast
it
is
actually
a
pretty
flavorful
light
lager
with
nice
carbonation
refreshing
and
crisp
not
that
i
reach
for
a
light
lager
very
often
but
this
is
not
a
bad
choice
for
the
style
d
definitely
drinkable
i
may
even
like
this
one
better
than
the
standard
shiner
bock
while
i
think
it
has
less
flavor
its
cleaner
and
more
drinkable
which
is
usually
what
im
looking
for
anyway
when
i
turn
to
shiner
pours
a
deep
gold
color
looks
really
good
of
a
light
lager
big
rocky
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaves
way
more
lace
than
i
would
have
thought
smells
faintly
of
grain
and
pale
malt
i
can
taste
some
pale
malt
notes
barely
maybe
some
hops
since
this
is
a
light
lager
i
didnt
expect
much
and
i
didnt
get
too
much
flavorwise
still
this
beer
has
more
character
than
shiner
blonde
oddly
probably
the
best
lite
beer
ive
had
shiner
definitely
has
a
victory
with
the
light
beer
circle
in
my
eyes
but
its
far
from
their
best
offerings
drinkability
not
so
bad
actually
a
light
beer
that
isnt
entirely
devoid
of
character
and
flavor
drinkability
id
take
this
over
most
of
the
light
beers
ive
tried
that
being
said
life
is
too
short
to
put
just
about
any
of
the
style
in
a
regular
rotation
d
eh
got
one
in
the
family
pack
ill
drink
it
but
doubt
ill
ever
order
one
overall
weak
in
aroma
and
flavor
rather
have
a
bmc
dont
recommend
one
and
done
not
bad
at
all
i
was
not
expecting
much
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
something
for
the
hot
summer
months
ball
games
or
bbq
it
blows
the
other
light
macro
lagers
out
of
the
water
this
is
my
least
favorite
shiner
its
a
little
boring
but
it
still
far
exceeds
the
macro
lites
happy
100th
shiner
congratulations

pretty

has

i
find

lagers
might
be
more
refreshing
after
a
long
hot
activity
lots
of
carbonation
is
felt
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
light
lager
i
dont
usually
care
for
light
beers
but
this
one
has
its
time
and
place
not
to
hate
on
bmc
here
but
i
would
much
rather
my
friends
bring
along
the
shiner
light
for
gameday
than
the
typical
offering
of
coors
and
miller
atmosphere
is
serviceable
flavor
is
not
bad
but
not
really
there
either
i
have
the
same
enthusiasm
about
the
feel
okay
quaff
overall
this
is
pretty
much
a
macro
like
beer
from
a
micro
brewery
in
an
attempt
to
draw
in
drinkers
of
macro
beers
not
a
great
beer
but
i
guess
it
does
what
it
was
intended
to
do
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
14k
gold
color
with
lots
of
visible
carbonation
the
head
was
creamcolored
retained
itself
well
as
a
cap
and
left
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
was
pretty
much
a
light
version
of
standard
macro
lager
smells
the
flavors
were
very
washed
out
dry
grains
pale
malt
and
lager
malt
all
bleached
away
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
average
and
the
carbonation
a
little
prickly
sadly
the
way
it
looked
was
the
best
part
this
is
basically
your
average
macro
light
lager
nothing
special
at
all
about
it
it
smells
a
lot
like
a
bud
light
with
grainy
malt
scents
things
are
still
kinda
hohum
boring
with
the
taste
the
same
grainy
malt
comes
out
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
though
which
is
good
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
for
a
beer
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
a
coors
light
though
durring
the
summer
this
is
a
very
good
light
beer
it
pours
a
very
nice
looking
clear
amber
color
the
smell
is
lightly
hoppy
the
taste
is
not
heavy
and
there
is
a
slight
crisp
malt
that
is
balanced
with
a
slight
bite
of
the
hops
no
real
special
flavors
natually
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
flavor
this
would
not
be
your
brew
but
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
refreshing
that
also
has
some
taste
this
is
a
very
good
choice
further
the
beer
goes
very
well
with
food
such
as
pizza
as
it
has
just
enough
flavor
to
do
so
since
the
beer
is
fairly
light
this
would
be
an
ideal
brew
for
a
hot
day
which
is
most
days
here
in
central
texas
out
by
the
pool
or
just
hanging
around
average
lager
color
medium
to
light
head
texas
makes
the
best
light
beer
of
all
time
not
a
bad
light
lager
just
lacking
depth
pours
out
to
a
rich
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
quickly
calms
to
about
116th
of
an
inch
some
lacing
aromas
are
weak
kind
of
smelled
like
wet
cardboard
mixed
with
malt
and
some
hops
taste
was
fair
but
unremarkable
maltiness
bread
hints
of
hops
and
dried
sugar
cane
mouthfeel
was
zesty
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
north
of
average
a
touch
more
on
the
flavor
with
some
more
complexity
and
this
would
be
fantastic
nonetheless
its
not
bad
special
thanks
goes
out
to
assurbanipaul
for
the
sample
overall
this
is
quite
the
treat
i
am
very
suprised
with
this
very
tasty
and
i
would
get
it
again
matches
with
my
favorite
lights
abita
and
sam
adams
good
stuff
for
its
style
i
think
its
the
best
this
brewery
makes
even
then
this
is
summertime
fetch
me
a
cold
one
beer
it
does
have
a
tinge
of
malt
standing
out
but
that
doesnt
make
it
a
must
try
wow
i
was
impressed
by
this
one
for
what
it
is
pours
a
brilliant
gold
color
with
a
decent
head
retention
not
much
aroma
going
on
here
faint
tastes
of
bread
dough
in
this
beer
not
much
else
a
touch
of
hops
here
and
there
but
thats
about
it
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
for
a
light
beer
its
acutally
kinda
thick
not
thin
watery
crap
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
texas
summer
day
pours
to
a
quickly
disappearing
head
color
is
pale
copper
color
with
a
dirty
brown
tinge
aroma
is
weak
but
nicely
malty
flavor
is
watery
and
dry
with
a
little
fresh
munich
malt
shining
no
pun
through
hoppiness
is
there
for
balance
only
finishes
clean
looks
dismal
smells
nice
tastes
weak
and
finishes
like
a
regular
shiner
bock
12
oz
brown
bottle
a
beer
from
the
texas
sampler
from
assurbanipaul
noticably
darker
than
many
light
beers
make
than
almost
any
light
beer
i
have
had
not
much
head
just
a
little
layer
of
foam
grassy
malt
dominates
the
scent
which
is
not
very
profound
for
a
light
lager
this
is
very
flavorful
and
malty
if
this
was
available
here
i
havent
seen
it
anywhere
except
here
i
would
see
me
making
this
my
extended
session
beer
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
twistoff
brown
glass
longneck
served
in
a
standard
pint
tapglass
another
beer
that
id
call
a
premium
light
beer
color
is
light
amber
with
average
head
smell
is
lightly
malty
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
taste
is
nice
and
malty
basically
this
is
shiner
bock
light
very
full
for
something
labled
as
light
drinkability
is
very
good
all
in
all
this
isnt
spectacular
but
very
good
for
a
light
beer
id
drink
it
again
without
complaint
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
very
light
copper
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
a
little
malty
and
grassy
but
not
too
much
going
on
there
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
with
some
caramel
flavors
not
much
hops
or
anything
else
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
the
drinkability
is
good
though
its
just
there
when
i
dont
wanna
get
that
full
feeling
on
a
hot
summer
day
ill
grab
for
the
shiner
light
otherwise
ill
take
the
original
or
just
something
else
mouthfeel
is
rather
watery
but
palatable
indeed
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
but
better
than
any
other
light
beer
ive
tried
if
you
are
to
judge
beers
strictly
within
the
style
this
has
to
receive
high
marks
shiner
light
comes
with
a
mediumsized
white
noisy
coarse
head
and
a
clear
orangeyamber
body
dusty
tangy
nose
is
just
a
little
grainsy
just
a
little
sourish
the
front
is
a
touch
fruity
thinning
through
the
somewhat
watery
middle
to
a
surprising
finish
some
evident
hops
and
grains
just
a
little
metal
this
is
not
bad
actually
its
not
too
far
off
shiner
bock
a
decent
fairly
tasty
light
beer
mouthfeel
was
strictly
average
like
most
light
beers
it
was
highly
drinkable
if
you
are
tired
of
the
usual
light
beer
parade
and
want
to
try
something
a
little
different
this
a
good
one
to
pour
its
only
available
in
texas
right
now
but
i
would
imagine
that
shiner
will
expand
distribution
if
this
beer
becomes
popular
my
guess
is
that
it
will
be
pours
a
very
clear
pale
golden
amber
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
and
wispy
lace
nose
is
rather
clean
with
some
notes
of
grain
and
some
underlying
semifloral
aromas
very
light
and
crisp
in
texture
with
a
moderate
amount
of
active
carbonation
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
grain
flavor
that
begins
to
turn
bitter
as
notes
of
grain
husks
begin
to
express
themselves
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
steely
metallic
flavor
that
becomes
more
pronounced
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
that
eventually
gives
way
to
a
light
lemony
hop
bite
nothing
special
though
for
a
light
beer
this
is
a
step
up
from
the
macros
o
meh
i
think
it
is
not
terrible
to
drink
but
i
dont
see
the
point
almost
no
flavor
and
what
is
there
is
not
terribly
appealing
overall
for
light
beers
probably
the
best
i
have
tried
it
actually
has
flavor
and
aroma
essentially
tastes
like
a
watered
down
euro
lager
nice
enough
for
a
3
5
abv
sessionalble
lager
ok
lager
hint
of
floral
on
the
finish
the
taste
highlights
a
more
grainy
character
with
a
clean
hop
finish
light
beers
are
light
beers
are
light
beers
this
one
is
a
little
better
than
some
overall
its
been
around
for
years
so
there
must
be
a
market
for
it
yet
another
beer
that
snobs
love
to
rip
on
i
tend
to
like
beers
that
i
dont
have
to
chew
on
taste
like
coffee
or
chocolate
or
fruit
amstel
light
fits
my
tastes
a
tasty
refreshing
beer
i
can
drink
anytime
this
beer
does
not
deserve
so
many
terrible
ratings
get
over
yourselves
people
its
not
bad
if
youre
sitting
in
the
sun
on
a
hot
day
with
a
200ml
bottle
wouldnt
serve
with
dinner
wouldnt
decline
one
however
this
only
being
reviewed
so
i
have
a
complete
list
of
beers
ive
tired
and
its
sad
but
this
is
on
it
it
should
also
be
noted
that
this
is
being
reviewed
solely
for
the
sake
of
being
a
completest
always
remember
if
its
skunk
its
junk
an
average
beer
nothing
special
as
lager
i
really
like
it
much
more
than
some
of
the
other
light
beers
tastes
great
and
isnt
as
filling
as
the
others
when
i
am
on
a
diet
this
is
my
go
to
light
beer
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
but
thats
not
saying
much
its
just
bad
all
around
bad
had
amstel
light
for
the
first
time
over
the
weekend
was
ok
at
best
awful
really
couldnt
drink
this
beer
i
will
usually
pick
this
up
to
serve
at
parties
i
wont
serve
any
of
the
big
3
light
beers
this
one
at
least
has
real
beer
pretensions
however
limited
and
swill
drinkers
wont
complain
that
theres
no
normal
beer
if
this
is
in
a
cooler
on
the
back
porch
not
horrible
not
great
pretty
much
right
down
the
middle
with
perhaps
a
bit
stronger
nose
mild
skunk
than
expected
thin
on
the
palate
straw
color
and
limited
aftertaste
amstel
is
also
my
preferred
golf
course
beer
its
available
from
the
drinks
cart
at
most
courses
isnt
terrible
and
you
can
drink
6
of
them
without
losing
your
putting
stroke
better
than
many
of
the
other
popular
light
lagers
this
however
is
not
saying
much
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
a
bitterness
i
would
not
expect
from
a
beer
like
this
hey
its
better
than
heineken
if
you
like
bitter
aftertaste
in
the
form
of
an
amber
watery
beer
than
this
one
for
you
very
little
body
to
this
beer
allina
all
its
a
mediocre
skunk
beer
not
bad
significantly
better
in
the
netherlands
than
in
the
states
no
where
near
as
bitter
i
would
take
this
over
most
in
this
category
but
this
is
no
winner
awful
tastes
like
a
watered
down
lager
proper
amstel
isnt
as
bad
but
still
nothing
to
sing
praise
over
i
dont
see
this
beer
as
any
different
than
all
other
light
beers
ill
drink
itif
you
buy
me
one
and
if
your
pretty
overall
a
little
more
flavor
and
this
could
be
considered
a
pretty
decent
light
beer
unfortunately
this
is
extremely
bland
and
water
will
quench
the
thirst
better
fortunately
enough
theres
nothing
awful
about
it
either
meaning
it
serves
its
purpose
well
enough
the
finish
has
some
malt
sweetness
to
it
but
is
generally
lacking
in
flavor
overall
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
for
the
sad
style
of
light
lager
its
not
a
bad
representation
it
poured
golden
yeal
light
head
lots
of
carbonation
and
some
lacing
it
had
the
taste
of
corn
and
metal
with
hints
of
anything
was
also
watery
and
light
bodied
it
was
refreshing
had
no
edge
and
went
down
easy
it
had
no
after
to
speak
of
and
not
many
redeeming
qualities
good
party
beer
i
guess
for
all
those
hipster
types
out
there
pours
a
light
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
some
very
spotty
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
just
of
some
yeast
and
grain
nothing
fancy
really
the
taste
is
on
the
flat
side
and
watereddown
with
just
some
grain
with
a
hint
of
floral
as
well
slight
metallic
taste
through
out
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
amstel
light
2
55
refreshing
beer
and
that
is
it
though
not
bad
among
its
style
overall
it
enjoyed
this
beer
it
beats
out
95
percent
of
light
lagers
out
there
it
beats
out
bud
light
coors
light
natural
light
but
the
price
is
to
high
for
my
pocket
book
i
will
drank
amstel
light
in
the
future
from
a
break
from
the
norm
but
i
will
stick
miller
light
from
now
wholly
unimpressive
this
beer
is
not
worth
the
money
and
is
hardly
worth
drinking
it
is
flat
tasteless
nearly
colorless
and
has
zero
zing
in
the
moth
one
might
consider
it
refreshing
if
you
looking
for
a
super
light
beer
that
resembles
water
o
unbelievably
bad
slightly
darker
than
us
light
lagers
the
head
dissapates
quickly
leaving
only
the
impression
of
light
malts
and
tangy
hop
flavor
is
very
slight
a
bitterness
that
leaves
immediately
when
swallowed
leaving
no
notable
flavors
other
than
light
malts
and
bitter
hops
same
as
the
nose
carbonation
level
is
very
heavy
with
a
very
watery
mouthfeel
yet
this
same
trait
makes
this
beer
as
easy
to
drink
as
a
diet
soda
unimpressive
but
inoffensive
and
a
less
offensive
flavor
then
most
american
light
lagers
this
is
a
beer
whose
whole
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
overall
this
beer
is
just
barely
a
step
above
water
almost
no
flavor
whatsoever
not
the
worst
wash
on
the
market
but
another
generic
macro
euro
lager
type
this
one
falling
on
the
sweeter
side
with
an
extract
malt
vibe
and
a
general
lack
of
anything
fresh
or
interesting
more
carbonation
would
make
this
passable
and
its
not
bad
from
the
bottle
but
a
little
air
exposure
in
the
glass
and
the
beer
goes
flat
a
little
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
hard
to
credit
hops
for
that
its
a
little
filling
as
well
which
is
odd
for
a
beer
this
low
in
abv
it
doesnt
even
work
to
catch
a
quick
buzz
its
not
horribly
off
in
flavor
which
i
guess
is
redeeming
in
some
sense
but
this
is
a
pretty
beat
brew
and
one
to
avoid
if
you
are
looking
for
quality
lager
o
euro
light
lager
for
the
faint
of
heart
if
you
drink
then
please
dont
drive
and
if
youve
gotta
drive
then
do
us
all
a
favor
and
please
dont
drink

edit
the
bottle
i
had
must
have
been
skunked
out
i
had
this
again
recently
at
my
grandparents
and
it
was
excellentfor
the
style
the
appearance
of
amstel
light
was
a
light
golden
amber
color
the
smell
of
it
was
a
little
like
corn
but
very
little
smell
overall
the
taste
was
a
little
watery
but
did
have
a
little
bit
of
hops
to
it
overall
not
bad
but
it
did
taste
a
little
watered
down
compared
to
other
beers
that
i
have
tried
o
disgusting
for
the
most
part
no
flavor
or
aroma
to
speak
of
whats
there
is
actually
terrible
and
skunky
who
drinks
this
stuff
i
think
the
reviews
are
overly
harsh
because
this
is
an
import
and
a
gasp
lager
its
not
supposed
to
be
an
ipa
if
you
judge
it
against
what
its
supposed
to
be
i
think
it
easily
meets
the
mark
even
if
its
not
setting
a
new
standard
this
beer
does
not
offendas
many
lights
do
and
instead
provides
an
unassuming
gardening
beer
it
is
a
nice
light
beer
but
not
worth
the
high
price
id
rather
have
a
notaste
coors
or
bud
light
than
an
amstel
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
aroma
and
taste
are
not
very
appealing
good
mouthfeel
medium
light
body
crisp
carbonation
not
too
watery
look
this
isnt
a
good
beer
by
any
means
but
it
might
get
the
job
done
on
a
sweltering
day
and
its
your
first
and
youre
not
expecting
much
and
youre
really
thirsty
and
you
cant
have
too
much
alcohol
cause
you
have
to
drive
soon
and
so
on
and
so
forth
or
you
could
just
have
water
and
wait
for
something
better
to
come
along
i
dont
know
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
blotches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
and
some
skunky
vegetal
aromas
taste
is
pretty
watery
and
is
mainly
of
grain
and
a
mild
grassy
note
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
thin
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
poor
beer
that
is
watery
and
thin
overall
this
is
a
very
good
light
beer
it
exceeds
expectations
for
me
anyway
for
a
light
beer
pleasant
tasting
and
easy
to
drink
i
have
tried
a
number
of
light
beers
and
to
date
this
was
the
best
until
i
find
another
light
beer
to
be
better
this
would
be
my
favorite
it
is
truly
amazing
that
this
beer
is
literally
nothing
the
wonders
of
science
this
brew
poured
with
a
half
finger
of
pure
white
head
that
actually
took
awhile
to
dissipated
the
body
was
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
moderate
visible
carbonation
the
nose
was
very
mild
with
a
hint
of
grain
and
nothing
else
the
taste
waswellpretty
terrible
i
got
a
hint
of
grass
grain
and
metal
the
body
was
thicker
than
expected
with
moderate
carbonation
the
metal
lasted
until
the
finish
that
was
luckily
pretty
quick
nothing
about
this
beer
was
very
pleasant
i
would
definitely
avoid
this
one
glad
this
was
free
at
a
wedding
forgettable
offer
if
you
want
a
beer
to
drink
but
dont
want
the
carbs
give
it
a
try
my
best
review
ever
got
this
at
an
open
bar
at
a
wedding
it
is
truly
awful
makes
bud
light
seem
tasty

how
about
now
holy
shit
still
not

this

is
still
unbelievably
terrible
almost
beyond

originally
reviewed

oh
what
well
this
little
silly
goes
very
well
with
the

maybe
on

a

with

brotzmann
overall
ill
drink
this
beer
any
day
of
the
week
over
any
american
adjunct
lager
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
the
appearance
was
perhaps
it
was
the
glass
i
used
but
anyway
a
good
beer
to
session
during
a

event
i
actually
like
this
macro
o
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
and
not
one
that
i
will
have
very
often
at
the
open
bars
at
many
receptions
and
conferences
this
is
often
the
best
choice
but
otherwise
i
might
avoid
it
overall
it
is
somewhat
refreshing
but
not
flavorful
at
all
possibly
good
on
a
very
warm
day
but
otherwise
not
worth
the
time
a
nice
beer
for
a
lite
pleasent
hops
taste
nice
color
it
purs
with
a
weak
head
on
my
glass
low
carbonation
it
has
a
nice
palate
for
being
a
light
beer
better
by
far
than
most
american
light
beers
i
would
drink
it
anyday
of
the
week
i
have
not
tasted
the
regular
version
soon
i
am
going
to
do
it
o
its
beer
thats
about
it
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
that
makes
you
wanna
keep
drinking
to
balance
out
the
grainy
bitterness
so
you
can
easily
go
through
a
bunch
of
these
if
you
wanted
to
with
that
being
said
id
take
this
over
coors
or
bud
light
anyday
so
its
definitely
better
than
those
beers
in
my
opinion
overall
the
beer
selection
was
weak
so
i
tried
something
i
hadnt
had
before
not
good
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
unless
it
was
free
and
i
was
planning
on
drinking
20
of
them
while
camping
o
typical
lager
nothing
i
would
grab
again
only
drank
this
one
because
it
was
really
the
only
thing
available
this
is
yet
another
lightly
flavored
lager
its
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
overall
its
forgettable
nose
is
heavy
on
the
grains
straw
wet
hay
reminds
me
of
my
days
working
at
a
garden
center
pours
like
my
piss
after
a
week
in
the
bush
plus
a
finger
of
a
fizzy
white
cap
ends
up
looking
like
a
decent
lager
though
to
be
honest
its
got
that
metallic
brown
corn
presence
that
youll
find
in
new
castle
stella
and
the
like
i
have
no
idea
what
this
comes
from
but
its
there
across
the
board
not
offputting
really
perfectly
drinkable
i
would
never
seek
this
out
though
overall
fine
yeah
it
is
what
it
is
my
frst
light
beer
are
they
supposed
to
taste
bad
like
that
like
every
food
andor
drink
which
is
light
but
good
for
you
overall
this
beer
is
not
for
me
i
will
happily
drink
while
in
the
hot
sun
and
gentle
breezes
at
the
pool
at
the
all
inclusive
next
time
in
aruba
but
this
is
not
a
discretionary
choice
for
me
rjt
o
a
decent
beer
that
fills
the
need
while
mowing
the
lawn
or
killing
a
thirst
but
fails
in
the
long
run
its
definitely
better
than
bud
light
or
coors
light
but
that
doesnt
mean
much
o
this
is
a
pretty
standard
light
lager
fortunately
its
better
than
coors
light
and
bud
light
but
thats
still
not
saying
much
this
beer
is
terrible
im
not
sure
what
a
light
lager
can
do
to
make
itself
good
but
this
beer
made
no
effort
to
sum
it
up
not
the
best
but
better
than
a
handful
a
quality
beer
as
long
as
someone
else
pays
for
it
if
your
paying
and
want
a
light
beer
just
go
american
and
buy
twice
as
much
beer
for
the
same
price
overall
not
worth
purchasing
at
its
price
save
your
hard
earned
s
d
no
69
golden
and
clear
appearance
with
a
decent
light
and
white

that
forms
some
corn
and
grain
in
the
nose
mixed
in
with
a
little
rag
weed
and
some
citrus
very
mellow
taste
slight
sweetness
from
the
malt
with
a
touch
of
grain
and
hay
nice
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
smooth
and
light
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
enjoyed
it
it
is
what
it
is
a
fairly
simple
light
lager
overall
nothing
i
will
waste
my
time
with
again
its
only
real
selling
point
is
that
its
relatively
inoffensive
unless
youre
offended
by
bland
flavorless
beers
ug
the
beer
drinkers
light
beer
this
is
not
avoid
very
light
aroma
of
lager
yeast
and
a
touch
of
grain
not
much
going
on
looks
like
carbonated
water
with
added
beer
color
white
head
that
was
not
there
when
i
put
the
bottle
down
way
too
fizzy

in

and
flavor
are
flat
zero
watery
craaaappy
save
your
money
i
bought
a
12
pack
based
on
their
motto
that
it
is
a
beer
drinkers
light
beer
it
took
me
over
a
month
to
drink
the
12er
it
became
my
beer
of
last
resort
god
awful
front
end
and
back
end
taste
this
is
garbage
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
and
have
told
many
to
avoid
nearly
the
same
consistency
as
water
i
did
not
find
this
beer
offensive
but
it
was
not
very
good
either
it
is
a
clear
gold
taste
and
flavor
are
near
nil
watery
not
as
good
as
mineral
water
crappy
beer
not
worth
buying

i
finished
the
bottle
only
because
i
had
to
flush
a
sandwich
with
something
overall
light
beers
are
why
i
thought
i
didnt
like
beer
in
my
early
drinking
days
but
i
want
to
try
as
many
as
i
can
and
light
beers
are
still
beers
as
you
can
imagine
it
seems
to
be
a
watered
down
version
of
amstel
any
head
that
forms
will
vansish
quickly
distinguishing
smells
are
not
there
and
the
taste
is
not
noteworthy
or
special
a
very
typical
macro
brew
it
comes
in
plastic
liters
in
parts
of
europe
so
that
was
convenient
odcould
be
worse
end
review
poured
all
head
standard
bmc
white
settled
down
to
a
clear
standard
straw
yellow
smell
has
a
hint
of
the
start
of
skunking
and
standard
grass
and
grain
taste
is
just
a
standard
bmc
despite
all
the
advertising
claims
that
he
has
so
much
more
flavor
than
other
light
beers
the
only
thing
a
little
stronger
than
most
lights
is
the
bitter
finish
so
id
say
acceptable
if
you
like
standard
bmc
lights
but
thats
about
it
innocuous
plain
and
good
for
totally
divided
attentions
and
evidently
popped
collars
d
ok
and
not
bad
its
somewhat
decent
for
a
light
beer
and
probably
one
of
the
lights
i
would
choose
for
a
miller
or
bud
low
flavor
profile
characteristic
of
a
light
beer
but
not
as
much
flavor
as
the
ads
claim
the
beer
has
still
tastes
too
watery
overallonly
positive
is
its
under
100
calories
besides
that
dont
drink
this
unless
you
like
light
beers
o
no
thanks
on
this
one
overall
a
beautiful
looking
beer
great
color
and
clarity
high
astringency
and
chalkiness
kills
this
for
me
i
dont
see
me
drinking
this
again
o
overall
not
a
good
beer
at
all
a
step
up
from
miller
light
but
thats
not
saying
much
would
prefer
bud
light
to
this
if
i
had
to
pick
a
light
beer
but
ill
be
switching
to
whiskey
for
the
night
pretty
soon
taste
is
very
plain
bland
and
boring
it
isnt
as
bad
as
many
but
its
not
good
theres
a
sharp
light
carbonation
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
and
a
bad
after
taste
overall
drinkability
like
having
sex
in
a
boat
you
know
the
rest
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
wellcarbonated
and
prickly
on
the
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
isnt
great
for
a
light
beer
it
tastes
like
it
should
be
a
bit
heavier
in
abv
overall
this
really
isnt
a
great
beer
its
servicable
but
just
barely
if
it
was
the
only
thing
available
id
drink
it
and
not
complain
too
much
but
picking
this
over
the
yuengling
and
stella
in
my
parents
fridge
was
a
mistake
absolutely
need
a
light
beer
this
is
better
than
many
but
seriously
sam
adams
light
or
bust
its
bizarre
to
think
that
this
might
be
better
than
most
peoples
experience
with
this
beer
because
i
took
this
bottle
straight
out
of
an
unopened
12
pack
overall
whats
the
point
well
it
is
a
light
beer
but
giving
it
a
modicum
of
a
flavor
profile
might
make
this
moderately
worthwhile
i
enjoy
the
damm
good
beer
commercials
but
thats
about
all
im
sure
that
amsterdam
isnt
that
proud
of
this
beer
anyway
this
was
probably
one
of
the
first
imported
beers
i
ever
had
and
honestly
it
wasnt
anything
to
really
brag
about
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
pale
yellow
with
a
little
head
on
top
the
aroma
is
basically
just
a
malt
based
brew
not
much
to
pick
out
really
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aromas
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
its
drinkable
but
thats
all
o
of
the
light
beers
i
sampled
this
evening
this
is
the
only
one
thats
actually
pretty
offensive
on
some
level
the
taste
is
just
bad
despite
it
minimal
but
thats
actually
there
i
dont
see
much
sense
in
consuming
this
beer
ever
o
not
a
beer
i
would
purchase
or
necessarily
reach
for
but
it
did
the
job
over
the
other
available
options
that
night
could
still
do
worse
than
an
amstel
light
pours
a
sickly
watery
straw
color
with
a
thick
boisterous
white
soapy
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
and
no
lacing
smells
like
corn
and
horse
piss
like
stella
artois
tastes
really
nasty
like
corona
and
death
had
a
baby
beer
like
rotten
corn
and
old
egg
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
has
a
heavy
carbonation
overall
it
is
one
of
the
worst
light
beers
ive
tried
if
you
are
in
a
trashy
mood
take
a
natty
light
over
this
dog
piss
not
as
bad
as
other
light
beers
that
ive
tried
but
still
not
close
to
being
good
this
isnt
bad
for
an
adjunct
lager
not
something
i
would
prefer
though
d
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
not
anything
special
d
it
has
low
abv
and
is
not
complex
though
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
to
chug
it
does
not
make
it
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
this
showed
to
be
just
another
cheap
selection
at
a
small
bar
its
like
the
bmcs
something
you
buy
to
save
money
instead
of
enjoy
a
good
beer
the
beer
was
pretty
light
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
too
high
but
honestly
one
of
the
better
beer
for
this
style
i
might
choose
this
one
if
given
the
choice
over
most
bmc
beers
its
drinkable
but
not
very
enjoyable
that
said
i
suppose
i
could
crush
these
all
night
with
nary
a
care
in
the
world
if
i
chose
but
i
would
never
choose
to
do
so
pours
a
light
yellow
color
some
carbonation
little
fizzy
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
ricy
very
slight
hop
note
the
taste
is
kinda
malty
skunkedricy
light
body
not
drinkable
why
do
they
make
these
kinds
of
beer
are
beyond
me
what
a
waste
of
water
d
just
bleh
overall
part
of
a
mix
6
so
i
dont
feel
too
bad
not
something
that
tastes
bad
enoughor
at
least
not
present
enough
to
recoil
from
but
ill
never
buy
again
the
flavor
is
watery
and
insubstantial
with
no
lingering
flavors
or
complexity
as
an
associate
once
said
beerflavored
water
pours
a
light
golden
body
with
a
small
head
just
has
the
average
dutch
skunky
smell
with
not
much
else
going
on
tastes
quite
light
not
too
much
here
but
more
than
most
light
beers
feels
pretty
bubbly
one
of
the
better
light
beers
out
there
but
that
is
not
saying
much
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
and
the
drinkability
is
low
due
to
lack
of
flavor
and
aroma
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
faint
sweetness
to
a
standard
european
lager
in
the
taste
dry
malt
and
a
small
bite
but
thin
and
not
much
going
on
a
small
bite
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
standard
lager
kind
of
aftertaste
nothing
too
exciting
here
i
guess
that
is
why
i
dont
golf
d
this
beer
was
average
in
the
drinkability
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
everyone
makes
it
out
to
be
is
it
a
great
beer
nope
does
it
do
its
job
for
the
most
part
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
most
offerings
from
bmc
d
this
is
a
very
weak
light
beer
but
isnt
that
the
point
honestly
if
you
want
a
light
beer
there
are
better
cheaper
ones
at
your
local
store
highly
sessionable
only
because
it
is
so
watery
and
will
not
fill
you
up
or
make
you
drunk
drink
on
a
hot
day
in
so
cal
5
years
ago
probably
a
sixer
while
mowing
the
lawn
today
just
1
all
i
can
do
very
thin
and
watery
to
be
expected
from
a
light
lager
nothing
to
really
enjoy
here
other
than
a
cold
flavorless
beer
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
another
one
certainly
not
on
my
dime
d
drinkable
like
flavored
water
is
drinkable
i
guess
if
you
wanted
to
chug
watery
beer
this
will
work
but
you
want
to
drink
a
beer
for
the
flavor
this
is
not
worth
having
d
easy
as
water
until
you
get
the
terrible
bitter
skunk
aftertaste
drinkability
it
is
easy
drinking
but
just
not
super
complex
its
nothing
i
would
probably
ever
by
again
just
such
a
boring
beer
its
nothing
id
search
out
again
its
better
then
alot
macros
from
usa
but
still
nothing
incredible
at
all
d
goes
down
easy
but
the
taste
and
aftertaste
ruin
any
possibility
of
good
quality
drinkability
i
was
surprised
of
the
flavor
profile
this
brew
offered
heady
doughy
singing
of
clear
maltsand
ultimately
very
refreshing
judging
this
beer
within
its
rightful
categoryas
a
light
beer
its
a
blockbuster
by
comparison
dont
let
the
light
connotation
dissuade
you
from
trying
it
d
easily
consumed
light
beer
but
definitely
not
enjoyable
would
not
recommend
to
anyone
light
bodied
high
carbonation
and
not
too
interesting
this
is
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
poured
this
very
light
colored
lager
into
my
glass
and
it
produced
a
broken
bubble
head
of
one
finger
which
vanished
in
seconds
mild
lacing
but
no
real
body
or
cling
to
that
the
color
is
a
3
on
the
srm
chart
smell
is
weak
corn
more
like
the
stalks
wheat
chaff
and
malt
taste
is
harsh
sour
bread
the
rest
i
cant
really
identify
just
not
good
a
little
buzz
on
my
tongue
but
leaves
the
back
of
my
throat
sort
of
sticky
and
dry
not
at
all
worth
the
price
glad
i
dont
have
any
more
of
this
to
drink
lighter
body
watery
quick
clean
drinking
but
definitely
not
pleasurable
its
not
horrible
for
light
beer
but
if
you
consider
the
price
buying
this
is
pretty
much
ludicrous
another
quizzo
beer
entry
it
ours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
soap
flowers
and
corn
syrup
normally
these
macroish
types
dont
smell
so
goofy
but
frankly
as
they
smell
bad
its
hard
to
really
say
this
is
entirely
unusual
the
taste
follows
closely
though
some
funky
wheat
slithers
its
way
in
there
as
well
coulda
done
without
that
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
sad
beer
one
i
would
definitely
never
call
a
damn
good
beer
even
with
spelling
errors
intact
d
because
the
taste
isnt
much
i
guess
its
another
easy
pounder
but
not
something
i
enjoy
anymore
pours
a
pale
golden
color
quite
clear
with
visible
carbonation
smells
mostly
of
grain
taste
brings
grain
and
some
husks
along
with
the
faintest
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel

with
loads

overly
carbonated
without
much
flavor
not
too
drinkable
is
it
drinkable
sure
but
with
all
the
decent
beers
out
there
im
not
sure
why
i
should
seek
this
one
out
d
i
didnt
find
this
all
that
drinkable
after
i
had
the
one
i
wasnt
looking
foward
to
the
taste
of
another
there
are
bettewr
light
beers
if
that
is
your
preference
overall
not
the
worst
tasting
just
the
least
tasting
i
had
this
evening
i
suppose
you
could
argue
that
this
is
super
drinkable
but
the
mouthfeel
really
hurt
this
for
me
also
with
no
flavor
why
would
anyone
want
to
drink
this
even
a
cheap
40
of
malt
liquor
is
better
than
this
despite
the
bad
ratings
i
kind
of
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
not
overly
carbonated
it
does
not
have
too
strong
of
flavoring
and
it
is
easy
to
find
its
not
a
preferable
beer
but
it
surely
has
nothing
wrong
with
it
not
watery
at
all
i
think
it
deserves
better
than
it
has
been
given
i
can
smell
this
beer
as
soon
as
i
open
it
but
i
always
like
to
start
with
the
pour
in
the
pint
glass
it
pours
a
bright
golden
crystal
clear
yellow
the
head
is
not
impressive
just
a
plain
white
that
doesnt
hang
out
very
long
the
nose
is
quite
pungent
with
a
lingering
skunkiness
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
but
with
less
skunkiness
it
was
replaced
with
some
bitterness
i
wouldnt
say
its
bad
especially
compared
to
some
of
the
other
ultras
and
lights
available
if
youre
watching
calories
however
like
my
friend
travis
says
watch
what
you
eat
not
what
you
drink
this
was
my
first
taste
of
imported
beer
at
a
robust
age
of
sixteen
i
was
stepping
up
in
the
world
i
didnt
like
this
gargage
14
years
ago
and
i
dont
like
it
now
its
funky
skunky
way
to
bitter
and
almost
impossible
to
drink
the
bottle
does
not
help
this
should
be
canned
and
served
next
to
carlsberg
im
only
reviewing
this
because
my
parents
had
some
friends
over
a
couple
weeks
ago
and
they
left
some
beers
behind
in
my
aging
fridge
that
i
leave
at
their
house
because
they
dont
drink
this
beer
poured
watery
and
had
a
billowing
white
head
that
took
about
two
minutes
to
fade
before
lacing
the
glass
it
is
the
palest
of
yellow
actually
kind
of
looks
urine
it
isnt
skunked
but
smells
as
if
it
is
horrible
smell
the
taste
is
weak
and
somewhat
metallic
i
only
gave
it
a
1
5
because
it
isnt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
ultra
light
pretty
flat
really
this
beer
is
awful
i
dont
even
know
why
they
make
beers
thatre
3
5
its
only
for
show
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
better
more
flavorful
beers
for
its
style
actually
a
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
out
but
id
drink
it
again
if
it
were
offered
of
course
this
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
best
craft
brews
but
it
is
a
good
beer
for
its
style
though
there
are
better
light
beers
out
there
d
its
a
light
lager
its
made
to
be
drank
copiously
altogether
theres
little
going
on
with
this
beer
other
than
a
slap
to
the
wallet
does
not
have
a
flavor
except
for
a
slight
after
taste
kind
of
gross
really
thin
mouthfeel
harsh
almost
stringent
mouthfeel
really
gross
the
body
was
as
expected
light
and
clean
drinkability
was
ok
for
a
style
thats
not
really
my
thing
overall
a
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
lite
beer
you
could
do
worse
d
great
on
a
warm
day
or
a
cool
night
smooth
with
a
great
crisp
aftertone
d
at
3
5
abv
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
and
i
have
goes
great
with
bbqd
brauts
andor
seafood
overall
dry
and
bland
not
worth
what
i
paid
for
a
case
of
it
honestly
i
would
rather
have
bud
light
a
darker
appearance
preppy
aroma
taste
teh
carbonation
probably
makes
you
think
theres
more
of
the
euro
hop
than
is
really
there
very
easy
going
down
it
is
a
very
light
beer
but
its
decent
enough
in
a
pinch
on
a
hot
day
tons
of
carbonation
plenty
of
water
but
it
does
the
trick
especially
with
some
smoke
im
really
surprised
how
low
of
a
rating
this
beer
has
received
it
is
my
favorite
light
beer
out
there
i
guess
beer
advocates
just
dont
like
light
beers
anyway
ive
really
liked
this
beers
for
many
years
i
think
its
got
a
good
enough
taste
and
doesnt
overdo
so
you
can
enjoy
it
with
a
meal
i
also
hear
its
got
the
lowest
amount
of
calories
for
those
who
care
besides
the
mgd
and
ultra
crap
decent
enough
mouthfeel
but
given
that
bottle
two
was
worse
than
bottle
one
the
drinkability
must
be
judged
as
weak
d
well
what
can
you
say
it
isnt
an
offensive
beer
it
certainly
doesnt
make
you
think
too
much
about
silly
things
like
flavor
and
character
and
goes
down
real
easy
if
you
understand
what
youre
getting
into
when
you
pop
the
cap
you
shouldnt
be
expecting
a
fullers
esb
i
could
down
a
few
in
a
sitting
before
i
got
really
bored
i
will
not
be
going
here
again
unless
i
have
no
choice
drinkability
the
best
characteristic
about
this
light
beer
its
dry
spicy
finish
also
seems
to
be
its
biggest
detriment
overall
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
but
its
still
a
light
beer
dmust
be
deprived
of
beer
for
weeks
to
truly
enjoy
this
ok
i
know
this
beer
is
lacks
true
flavor
but
has
a
better
taste
than
other
light
beers
out
there
and
that
is
what
it
is
a
light
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
in
my
opinion
d
i
was
hoping
this
imported
effort
would
be
a
more
interesting
effort
of
this
style
its
not
and
certainly
not
worth
the
extra
buck
or
2
a
sixer
over
a
domestic
light
beer
overall
i
like
amstel
better
than
heineken
although
i
feel
like
most
people
view
oppositely
either
way
this
beer
is
definitely
decent
not
too
exciting
and
has
no
bad
qualities
if
people
think
bud
represents
american
brewing
the
way
that
i
believed
that
amstel
represents
the
netherlands
i
understand
our
bad
rep
that
said
it
appears
theres
bad
beer
all
over
the
world
amstel
light
poured
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
rich
head
it
smelt
awful
and
just
offensive
it
smelt
almost
skunked
there
wasnt
much
in
the
taste
either
it
simply
didnt
have
a
taste
which
might
be
good
it
didnt
taste
like
the
smell
it
was
light
and
easy
to
drink
overall
its
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
and
its
a
better
light
beer
it
wasnt
good
but
at
the
same
time
its
not
really
bad
proost
as
far
as
light
beers
go
i
suppose
this
one
is
as
drinkable
as
they
come
however
im
glad
a
friend
gave
me
this
single
one
to
try
if
i
were
at
a
party
or
a
cook
out
and
this
was
the
beer
they
had
well
i
could
at
least
drink
it
probably
even
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
sure
its
uninteresting
and
comes
up
a
tad
watery
but
it
is
a
light
lager
harmless
and
forgettable
if
it
werent
for
these
humble
notes
id
be
hardpressed
to
recall
the
details
considering
that
this
is
a
light
beer
its
not
the
worst
but
ill
never
drink
it
again
d
this
beers
popularity
is
about
as
damning
an
indictment
of
the
light
lager
style
as
i
can
find
an
expensive
european
import
that
is
sadly
lacking
flavor
character
or
any
sense
of
refreshment
being
an
import
this
beer
is
kind
of
lagging
a
lot
of
flavor
lets
go
amsterdam
we
know
your
good
for
weed
lets
get
to
the
beer
this
is
a
pricey
beer
and
on
a
value
scale
there
are
many
light
beers
at
half
the
price
that
are
every
bit
as
good
and
in
many
cases
better
not
something
i
would
buy
again
notes
i
drank
this
right
after
i
had
a
heineken
light
and
this
beer
tasted
so
much
better
however
after
trying
this
by
itself
i
had
to
lower
my
scores
i
guess
being
better
than
heineken
light
isnt
saying
much
d
had
it
at
2
tuesdays
what
did
you
expect
joining
in
with
the
fiance
on
a
low
carb
diet
before
our
wedding
so
this
was
worth
a
try
it
pours
nearly
completely
clear
with
a
14
inch
head
which
quickly
vanishes
its
not
all
that
bad
its
drinkable
throw
a
lime
in
there
with
it
and
that
will
give
it
a
little
extra
boost
god
i
miss
my
porters
drinkability
not
something
id
ever
buy
for
myself
but
id
take
it
over
a
lot
of
beers
good
as
far
as
generic
light
lagers
goes
for
a
long
time
i
was
convinced
this
was
a
big
step
up
from
the
bmc
lights
of
the
world
i
though
it
always
had
just
enough
flavor
to
justify
that
claim
now
im
feeling
like
i
bought
into
hype
maybe
not
did
have
a
little
flavor
to
it
meh
flavor
is
thin
light
watery
particularly
as
the
carbonation
dissipates
tastes
better
directly
from
the
bottle
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
and
a
light
grainyfruity
finish
feel
is
flat
and
watery
in
either
case
fairly
drinkable
as
it
doesnt
offend
yet
has
not
character
whatsoever
to
justify
the
concept
my
pour
netted
a
little
better
than
a
fingers
worth
of
bubbly
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
the
color
was
a
light
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
slight
grassiness
underlain
by
a
cereal
quality
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
lightly
sweet
vanilla
taste
in
the
mouth
very
different
from
many
of
the
canned
light
beers
that
i
have
drank
of
late
finish
was
slightly
dry
kind
of
refreshing
it
would
probably
be
more
satisfying
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
id
have
it
again
but
id
never
buy
it
dont
think
it
would
pair
well
with
anything
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
smell
is
mild
some
hints
of
malt
taste
is
crisp
some
malts
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
here
feels
light
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
good
o
k
for
drinking
games
overall
this
makes
for
a
below
average
beer
its
not
like
amstel
light
tastes
bad
it
just
doesnt
really
taste
like
anything
honestly
if
i
feel
like
drinking
light
beer
ill
save
some
money
and
just
frat
hard
with
some
natty
overall
well
what
to
say
not
a
great
pilsner
as
my
fellow
bamembers
also
indicate
in
the
rating
however
i
think
that
most
people
here
seem
to
forget
that
this
beer
has
almost
no
calories
given
that
fact
i
think
the
brewers
did
a
great
job
still
being
able
to
put
so
much
taste
in
but
in
general
if
you
dont
have
any
overweight
and
not
on
a
diet
avoid
nothing
to
it
really
mouthfeel
is
extremely
light
bodied
one
is
reminded
of
the
phrase
beerflavored
water
that
i
guess
is
consistent
with
the
3
5
abv
would
be
more
drinkable
if
it
didnt
taste
so
bad
d
a
pbrcaliber
beer
at
a
premium
price
no
thanks
superior
to
bmc
but
not
enough
to
justify
the
price
differential
price
is
a
little
high
for
a
light
beer
but
it
tastes
better
then
your
normal
light
beers
what
more
really
needs
to
be
said
about
this
beer
obviously
nobody
here
at
ba
reads
this
really
wondering
if
amstel
is
a
decent
beer
or
not
we
all
know
it
isnt
it
is
boring
bland
but
apparently
pleases
the
masses
it
doesnt
necessarily
offend
but
my
one
complaint
is
the
premium
price
you
sometimes
see
it
for
why
pay
for
this
when
there
are
so
many
crafts
available
for
about
the
same
price
or
maybe
1
for
a
sixer
more
and
infinitely
more
enjoyable
hopefully
more
of
the
masses
will
catch
on
to
that
reality
soon
next
time
you
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
remember
that
there
is
6
pack
of
odouls
light
for
way
cheaper
d
it
is
what
it
is
it
isnt
going
to
blow
you
away
in
the
flavor
department
but
it
is
a
highly
drinkable
light
lager
that
is
easy
to
consume
a
few
in
a
single
sitting
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
poured
a
translucent
gold
with
a
two
inch
loose
frothy
white
head
that
eventually
settles
into
a
quarter
inch
cap
before
dissipating
into
a
swirl
nose
is
primarily
cereal
grains
and
adjuncts
consistent
with
nose
very
subdued
and
light
in
body
not
much
going
on
here
in
the
taste
department
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
a
little
watery
with
a
consistent
background
effervescence
from
start
to
finish
drinkability
well
its
drinkable
but
not
much
going
on
in
terms
of
flavor
still
theres
worse
out
there
out
at
a
bar
with
a
crappy
beer
selection
with
some
coworkers
so
i
ordered
one
poured
from
the
bottle
in
to
a
pint
glass
dull
yellow
color
decent
white
head
musty
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
both
boring
really
not
a
lot
to
this
beer
i
had
no
idea
until
now
that
amstel
light
is
only
3
5
wow
maybe
thats
why
it
tastes
like
water
definitely
gonna
think
twice
about
ordering
one
of
these
again
this
beer
is
now
the
official
i
cant
drink
any
more
tonight
but
ill
have
one
more
amstel
beer
back
before
i
knew
better
i
drank
amstel
light
a
lot
thinking
i
was
a
true
beer
afficionado
its
not
bad
beer
overall
but
its
nothing
i
would
run
out
and
buy
however
at
only
95
calories
per
12
oz
its
a
great
beer
to
drink
if
youre
on
a
diet
other
than
sam
adams
light
it
is
sadly
the
best
you
can
do
d
the
abv
on
this
was
actually
1
5
less
than
what
i
thought
it
would
be
now
i
see
why
people
can
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
at
a
bar
or
similiar
setting
but
i
ask
myself
why
this
stuff
taste
like
impending
doom
amstel
light
is
good
enough
if
your
trying
to
pass
the
time
at
a
party
that
you
dont
want
to
be
at
in
the
1st
place
so
its
got
that
going
for
it
but
nothing
else
overall
a
step
above
a
bmc
the
default
choice
for
me
when
its
this
or
a
bmc
goes
down
easy
enough
but
not
much
flavor
not
a
player
in
the
home
rotation
d
thirst
quenching
mild
and
easy
going
flavor
is
totally
non
aggressive
and
laid
back
this
is
the
beer
that
made
me
start
liking
beer
sometime
back
in
the
early
90s
d
its
definately
drinkable
with
the
limited
selection
at
the
kentucky
speedway
this
past
weekend
this
was
about
as
good
as
you
could
get
other
than
miller
and
bud
pours
gold
with
a
white
inch
head
smells
of
malt
and
a
little
yeast
very
light
a
crisp
with
a
mild
malty
flavor
some
light
grains
or
yeast
and
slight
hint
of
spice
overall
its
pretty
carbonated
and
on
the
watered
down
side
as
far
as
taste
goes
but
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
good
beer
from
a
refreshment
standpoint
but
boring
from
a
taste
standpoint
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
could
easly
drink
lots
of
these
but
dont
know
why
i
would
want
to
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
buy
this
agian
drinkability
not
exactly
something
i
would
go
searching
for
but
it
could
be
good
on
a
hot
day
with
some
food
d
easy
drink
for
hot
summer
day
however
not
my
typical
type
of
beer
d
yes
it
is
very
drinkable
very
smooth
and
watered
down
but
at
3
5
alcohol
youd
have
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
just
to
get
a
buzz
but
i
guess
thats
the
point
overall
absolutely
nothing
spectacular
here
very
overpriced
im
glad
i
got
it
on
sale
who
would
pay
regular
price
for
this
drinkability
for
a
light
lager
i
think
this
is
highly
drinkable
especially
in
warmer
weather
while
not
the
first
thing
i
would
go
for
it
is
more
sessionable
than
a
lot
of
beers
in
its
class
d
drinkable
well
i
could
probably
chug
a
couple
of
these
now
would
i
want
to
a
much
better
question
and
the
answer
is
no
though
in
a
pinch
i
would
take
this
over
a
bmc
lite
this
really
seems
more
like
an
american
adjunct
light
to
me
i
am
not
impressed
at
all
this
is
a
common
premium
option
in
bars
i
would
avoid
crystal
clear
as
pale
as
pale
can
be
the
smell
is
skunk
and
cereal
there
is
some
corn
floating
around
in
the
taste
unimpressive
at
best
i
would
stay
away
next
time
ill
just
grab
a
dollar
high
life
and
be
done
with
it
d
easy
to
drink
now
its
my
second
favorite
light
beer
dominating
still
modelo
light
the
old
throwback
import
for
me
ive
drank
many
of
these
over
my
lifetime
when
nothing
else
was
available
it
was
sorta
my
standby
for
a
while
i
realize
now
it
wasnt
as
good
as
i
thought
but
i
still
have
one
every
now
and
then
for
old
times
sake
d
not
really
much
to
this
i
mean
nothing
at
all
it
smells
bad
but
doesnt
taste
bad
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
i
think
my
grade
for
this
beer
is
higher
than
most
others
because
i
tried
to
judge
it
within
its
style
category
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
again
however
this
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
a
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
nothing
when
i
try
really
hard
i
can
detect
some
extremely
faint
malt
the
taste
is
little
easier
to
detect
that
the
aroma
but
it
is
still
mostly
nothing
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
it
is
actually
pretty
good
for
a
light
lager
overall
this
beer
tastes
too
much
like
water
for
my
likings
i
will
not
be
having
this
beer
again
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
watery
but
finishes
tingly
very
crisp
very
low
drinkability
i
know
a
lot
of
people
like
this
as
a
low
calorie
lighter
import
but
there
really
is
not
much
flavor
and
what
flavor
is
there
is
funky
and
skunky
drinkability
is
not
quite
as
good
as
other
light
lagers
should
go
down
like
water
and
it
doesnt
sickly
yellow
is
the
only
way
i
can
describe
the
color
of
this
beer
the
head
lasts
for
about
5
seconds
before
disappearing
completely
the
only
thing
i
can
discern
from
the
nose
is
that
this
beer
is
probably
skunked
tastes
of
grains
corn
and
some
kind
of
hopvery
unbalanced
watery
and
extremely
carbonated
reminiscent
of
a
club
soda
maybe
this
beer
has
some
sort
of
defining
flavor
but
i
cant
find
it
through
the
excess
carbonation
and
unappealing
aroma
i
couldnt
even
finish
this
one
bottle
its
too
bad
macrobrews
have
to
be
like
this
overall
maybe
all
the
marketing
has
clouded
my
judgment
a
bit
i
was
hoping
this
would
stand
up
a
little
better
than
its
american
macro
peers
but
eh
pass
on
this
one
drinkability
i
do
see
how
some
people
could
defend
this
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
all
it
is
mostly
water
but
there
has
to
be
a
better
light
beer
out
there
than
this
d
i
found
myself
having
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
if
you
see
the
international
beer
pack
at
world
market
buy
something
else
they
put
more
of
an
emphasis
on
number
of
countries
not
quality
of
beverages
dont
drink
and
review
d
better
than
most
american
lights
but
not
much
overall
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
it
is
awful
cold
and
even
worse
warm
there
is
room
for
improvement
however
pours
a
light
straw
amber
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
hint
of
lacing
smells
like
straw
hops
bitterness
and
skunk
tastes
like
watery
straw
with
lots
of
skunk
pretty
light
mouthfeel
with
average
carbonation
this
beer
was
not
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
especially
given
that
it
is
marketed
as
a
premium
quality
beer
here
in
the
us
almost
too
clear
when
poured
very
little
head
and
watery
taste
its
very
easy
to
put
down
a
few
in
a
short
time
because
of
the
lack
of
overall
beer
taste
it
has
a
lighter
feel
and
taste
than
typical
american
light
beers
but
has
a
better
drinkability
poured
a
pale
gold
with
a
moderate
fizzy
headlots
of
carbonation
a
grainycorn
aroma
with
a
faint
wiff
of
hops
some

not
bad
for
a
light
beerbut
kind
of
steep
in
price
drinkable
pours
clear
light
and
golden
with
no
head
bizarre
almost
no
aroma
also
the
taste
is
not
offensive
just
very
faint
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
almost
no
bitterness
to
balance
no
malt
not
a
bad
beer
but
barely
a
beer
leaves
a
lasting
impression
of
water
not
that
enjoyable
but
not
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
either
absolutely
a
horrible
beer
i
had
12
of
these
in
the
fridge
my
girlfriend
bought
and
after
one
it
was
time
to
put
my
boots
on
and
go
out
to
get
something
else
that
night
the
flavor
is
like
making
a
hybrid
tea
with
old
cardboard
and
selzer
water
it
literally
tastes
like
wet
paper
mixed
with
some
kind
of
glue
how
they
could
make
a
beer
this
bad
and
sell
it
for
9
99
a
6pack
price
at
my
corner
store
in
chicago
is
truly
miraculous
any
cheap
light
beer
ive
tried
busch
miller
etc
is
better
than
this
d
my
sister
swears
by
this
stuff
i
swear
at
it
i
guess
its
a
touch
better
than
most
lights
but
thats
faint
praise
seems
to
smell
taste
like
a
light
beer
no
big
deal
nothing
offensive
or
off
and
its
drinkable
enough
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
or
body
malty
overall
with
some
light
grain
and
a
smidge
of
grassy
hops
to
balance
finishes
clean
i
guess
if
youre
a
light
beer
drinker
wuss
this
is
a
good
choice
but
i
think
its
more
of
a
trendy
status
thing
than
a
flavor
thing
i
wont
pay
for
it
again
but
id
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
if
someone
handed
me
one
id
drink
it
again
but
it
would
need
to
be
cheaper
or
i
would
have
to
be
disparate
i
would
never
buy
this
for
myself
but
if
someone
is
willing
to
buy
me
one
i
wont
turn
it
down
sad
as
some
of
the
amstel
beers
available
in
the
netherlands
arent
bad
but
this
watered
down
swill
is
just
not
worth
having
isnt
it
still
a
good
beer
for
someone
who
wants
a
beer
but
is
watching
calories
a
def
step
up
from
some
other
light
domestic
macros
which
shall
remain
nameless
d
not
good
i
dont
know
how
this
stuff
is
popular
with
some
people
i
guess
marketing
goes
a
long
way
best
feature
was
that
it
was
no
charge
on
airplane
notes
from
92707
for
a
light
beer
this
one
is
not
the
worst
but
that
really
isnt
an
endorsement
certainly
it
is
drinkable
in
a
pinch
even
if
it
is
weak
nothing
metallic
here
but
it
has
a
little
grain
husk
like
malt
to
it
light
hops
light
sweet
smell
and
light
pale
color
but
what
do
you
expect
its
a
light
beer
the
taste
and
the
aroma
are
the
same
not
bad
for
a
lite
lager
golden
pour
with
a
weak
malt
scent
fairly
watery
on
the
palate
although
fuller
than
most
other
lites
flavor
is
rather
bland
there
is
a
decent
sharpness
but
it
soon
fades
low
abv
isnt
very
helpful
either
many
better
choices
out
there
d
you
could
drink
the
piss
out
of
this
the
question
is
why
would
you
when
there
are
much
better
sessionlawnmover
beers
out
there
dont
bother
d
with
so
many
other
choices
why
bother
drinkability
very
easy
it
is
wahat
it
is
rather
have
the
real
thing
in
amsterdam
in
short
this
beer
is
a
pretty
decent
light
ale
with
enough
flavor
to
make
you
want
to
drink
another
and
since
the
calories
and
alcohol
content
are
both
low
you
can
in
clear
conscience
overall
it
about
average
for
a
widely
distributed
macro
but
not
worth
the
premium
import
title
sub
par
just
something
to
wash
food
down
with
nothing
i
would
go
out
looking
for
another
lackluster
beer
in
the
style
for
a
light
beer
its
not
all
that
bad
ill
drink
one
if
its
handed
to
me
but
im
not
going
to
necessarily
ever
look
for
it
not
that
its
hard
to
find
darker
shade
of
gold
so
its
not
as
pale
looking
as
many
other
light
lagers
sweet
grainyhay
taste
watery
but
also
nothing
bad
either
really
actually
one
of
the
better
light
beers
ive
had
this
beer
looked
weak
when
poured
into
my
glass
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
laced
poorly
little
retention
aromas
were
hay
yeast
and
a
macrobrew
staleness
flavors
were
of
lager
malts
musty
yeast
and
some
lagging
hops
at
the
end
typical
import
macrobrew
stuff
the
body
was
very
light
and
washed
out
just
like
the
alc
no
depth
or
punch
to
it
technically
beer
but
a
very
boring
one
decent
session
beer
if
your
having
a
hard
time
finding
a
better
one
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
thin
soapy
white
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
stale
grassy
hops
grain
and
sulfurrusty
metal
the
grassy
hops
hit
up
front
with
some
sulfur
notes
there
is
an
odd
fruitiness
to
it
perhaps
a
combination
of
grain
husk
and
lemon
the
feel
is
light
almost
watery
well
carbonation
finishes
very
neutral
easy
beer
to
swill
down
a
light
euro
lager
for
sure
has
some
hop
flavor
which
puts
it
up
a
notch
over
the
american
light
macro
overall
this
is
really
not
a
bad
light
brew
i
could
drink
this
with
no
problem
and
is
a
good
beer
for
after
mowing
the
grass
pairing
suggestions
stinky
marijuanna
thats
about
the
only
thing
that
could
stand
up
to
the
pungent
skunk
taste
of
this
beer
when
this
beer
is
poured
into
a
glass
it
becomes
apparent
that
there
is
little
texture
and
body
the
coloring
here
is
so
thin
i
would
say
it
is
closer
to
water
than
beer
however
it
is
crisp
looking
the
aroma
carries
a
wheatlike
scent
high
amount
of
grain
aroma
to
this
one
the
flavor
is
a
yeasty
concoction
of
cornmeal
with
the
eversofaint
taste
of
leftover
hops
actually
a
very
appealing
flavor
considering
its
light
label
there
is
plenty
to
enjoy
about
its
drinkability
the
feel
it
leaves
is
so
light
and
fizzy
that
the
ability
to
drink
more
than
one
is
pretty
much
guaranteed
good
for
a
light
lager
doesnt
really
appeal
to
me
i
think
not
worth
the
premium
price
that
they
try
to
get
for
it
its
a
marketing
beer
buy
a
cheaperbetter
american
beer
if
you
are
going
to
drink
a
light
beer
it
was
ok
for
a
light
i
agree
with
other
reviews
better
than
a
heine
d
a
big
pass
on
this
stinker
it
is
what
it
is
a
euromacro
tastes
like
it
has
some
class
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
not
exactly
recommended
d
it
is
easy
drinking
and
when
given
very
limited
options
it
is
drinkable
this
is
a
light
beer
which
carries
more
of
a
beer
flavor
than
actual
characteristics
still
one
of
the
more
drinkable
light
beers
ive
had
certainly
not
badtasting
but
overall
a
shrugyourshoulders
offering
when
not
much
else
is
available
threw
down
a
few
cans
of
this
at
a
recent
gettogether
not
terrible
but
not
something
id
ever
seek
out
very
light
watery
mouthfeel
that
would
lend
itself
best
to
washing
down
strong
bbq
hopefully
not
ruining
the
flavor
in
the
first
place
tastes
of
corn
very
little
malt
you
could
do
better
than
amstel
overall
amstel
light
is
in
my
top
two
for
light
lager
because
it
has
distinctive
flavor
and
a
nice
feel
to
its
light
body
i
would
much
rather
drink
this
beer
than
most
lls
mouthfeeldrinkability
even
though
the
initial
attack
is
aggressive
and
even
biting
it
very
quickly
eases
up
and
becomes
really
smooth
and
soft
remaining
so
right
through
the
swallow
unfortunately
this
doesnt
save
the
beer
from
itself
its
a
hard
one
to
drink
out
of
a
glass
purposefully
noticing
all
of
its
warts
but
on
a
blistering
day
out
of
the
cooler
and
down
the
gullet
it
certainly
has
its
place
as
with
many
light
lagers
the
drinkability
is
high
like
water
it
would
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
i
can
see
this
as
a
lawnmower
beer
or
an
end
of
a
long
evening
drink
i
dont
think
i
would
pay
real
money
for
it
however
very
let
down
on
my
first
amstel
light
attempt
pours
an
incredibly
pale
and
soulless
yellow
this
beer
could
easily
pass
as
bud
light
upon
popping
the
top
the
smell
is
immediately
amsterdam
skunk
taste
is
pale
dead
and
boring
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
very
american
macro
rice
brew
going
on
here
drinkability
about
the
same
as
natty
light
at
a
campus
keg
party
its
just
unimpressive
and
not
good
ugh
this
is
gross
tastes
like
skunkiness
grain
and
rice
appearance
is
standard
for
the
style
although
thats
nothing
im
gonna
get
too
excited
about
weak
head
straw
color
mild
hint
of
hops
body
is
fairly
thin
but
again
appropriate
to
the
style
i
dunno
im
not
feeling
it
just
your
average
pale
euro
lager
here
no
surprises
yet
not
a
total
waste
of
time
excellent
lawnmower
summertime
beer
pours
a
really
bright
clear
golden
color
straight
out
of
12oz
bottle
with
a
thin
1finger
head
nothing
really
to
note
of
as
far
as
smell
goes
just
a
lightly
sweet
hint
of
malt
taste
was
decent
malty
sweetness
no
noticeable
hop
presence
overall
not
horrible
but
not
the
best
beer
either
if
you
had
to
go
with
a
major
beer
brand
from
amsterdam
you
might
want
to
pick
the
one
in
the
green
bottle
lets
see
how
close
we
can
get
to
making
a
3
2
beer
and
still
sell
it
at
liqour
stores
poured
a
pale
watery
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
goes
quickly
very
corny
smell
skunky
the
taste
is
a
bad
mixture
of
hop
and
barley
too
light
to
pick
too
much
up
watery
body
and
pepsi
like
carbonation
not
the
worst
but
not
worth
the
relatively
high
price
tag
d
if
you
take
it
for
what
it
is
a
macro
lager
you
could
do
much
worse
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
i
could
see
myself
knocking
a
few
of
these
back
on
the
golf
course
in
the
summer
tolerable
at
best
though
average
drinkability
its
a
macrostyle
lager
thats
about
all
you
can
say
there
are
beers
of
comparable
quality
for
a
lot
less
money
i
can
drink
a
million
of
these
but
now
after
realizing
that
they
are
glorified
water
i
think
that
i
will
skip
it
in
the
future
overall
not
a
good
beer
im
always
baffled
at
the
popularity
of
beers
like
this
heineken
budweiser
etc
apparently
people
really
really
like
water
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
however
i
have
a
good
friend
who
thinks
he
is
a
pretty
big
beer
afficionado
that
used
to
call
this
his
favorite
beer
and
said
he
would
drink
only
this
i
know
he
would
like
to
forget
this
and
would
never
admit
to
this
now
but
felt
i
had
to
mention
it
since
he
frequents
this
site
and
will
most
likely
read
this
review
a
decent
drinkability
if
you
are
looking
to
have
a
few
after
a
long
day
of
work
and
want
something
too
drink
while
socializing
overall
this
beer
is
much
better
on
draft
than
from
a
bottle
and
definetly
a
can
frothy
head
lasts
much
longer
on
draft
than
from
a
bottle
smells
of
malt
but
not
much
else
pours
to
a
bright
yellow
with
a
quickly
disappearing
fizzy
head
taste
is
bland
without
much
backbone
extremely
slight
bitterness
typical
of
a
lager
the
carbonation
is
almost
the
most
evident
aspect
of
this
brew
it
tastes
almost
watery
at
best
if
this
is
a
typical
light
lager
i
wont
be
looking
for
any
more
seriously
if
youre
calorie
conscious
and
are
just
seeking
to
quench
your
thirst
drink
water
seltzer
iced
tea
or
diet
soft
drinks
because
if
you
really
need
a
beer
it
means
you
really
like
beer
which
means
you
want
a
beer
that
tastes
like
beer
and
though
this
is
slightly
more
beerlike
than
other
light
lagers
its
still
doesnt
have
much
beer
taste
so
really
whats
the
point
pours
pale
yellow
with
almost
no
head
smell
is
sweet
with
corn
and
maltiness
in
the
taste
very
carbonated
and
light
obviously
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
decent
enough
nothing
spectacular
but
i
dont
get
all
the
really
low
ratings
this
wasnt
supposed
to
be
a
big
bold
beer
that
turned
out
light
rating
it
for
what
it
is
this
is
good
for
the
style
drinkability
ahh
something
try
when
going
out
worth
a
try
when
going
out
if
they
dont
sell
anythingelse
it
is
a
light
lager
and
its
decent
so
no
real
problems
with
giving
it
some
relatively
high
scores
had
this
ontap
for
the
first
time
at
legal
sea
foods
in
short
hills
did
its
job
well
for
being
a
light
easily
drinkable
brew
didnt
realize
the
abv
was
so
low
at
3
5
went
down
effortlessly
like
water
strawcolored
gold
appearance
with
no
head
bland
typical
average
brew
smell
and
the
taste
wasnt
anything
to
write
home
about
bland
unappealing
and
uninviting
tasted
very
macrolike
with
an
obvious
corn
flavor
drinkability
was
easy
because
of
the
low
abv
but
definitely
would
not
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
setting
just
wanted
to
try
it
thin
and
crisp
light
bodied
not
very
good
repeated
on
my
most
of
the
night
and
it
wasnt
the
welcome
hop
burps
pretty
nasty
probably
the
best
choice
at
my
company
xmas
party
but
i
was
one
and
done
just
bad
very
watered
down
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
light
in
color
and
smell
im
not
one
for
light
beers
usually
and
this
is
one
of
those
reasons
why
just
overall
lacking
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
and
get
smashed
but
very
hard
to
sit
and
drink
one
or
two
and
enjoy
it
i
am
very
surprised
to
see
the
highly
negative
reviews
for
amstel
light
as
usual
the
ba
crowd
likes
to
tear
down
a
beer
just
because
it
is
a
light
beer
it
is
said
over
and
again
that
a
beer
should
be
reviewed
based
on
its
category
unfortunately
a
lot
of
people
dont
do
that
amstel
light
has
a
nice
full
flavor
for
a
light
beer
with
an
awesome
mouthfeel
to
be
avoided
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
minimal
white
head
on
it
smell
is
of
corn
with
a
somewhat
skunky
kind
of
aroma
taste
is
sweet
and
some
what
grainy
i
can
taste
some
of
the
corn
that
i
found
in
the
smell
too
a
little
sweet
honey
is
found
at
the
end
of
the
sips
too
moutfeeling
is
light
and
refreshing
but
hey
i
wanted
to
try
it
i
just
would
not
recommend
it
drinkability
is
supurb
for
obvious
reasons
there
is
not
much
good
to
say
about
this
beer
if
a
drinker
is
looking
for
a
very
thin
brew
that
doesnt
taste
much
this
is
the
brew
for
him
or
her
d
one
step
above
pellegrino
and
washes
pizza
down
but
i
have
got
to
get
my
inlaws
to
broaden
their
horizons
drinkable
but
pretty
insipid
amstel
light
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
an
all
around
average
light
beer
for
the
money
there
are
just
as
good
american
light
lagers
at
a
lower
price
12
ounce
can
poured
with
vigor
glad
i
didnt
have
to
pay
for
it
i
would
have
wanted
my
money
back
decent
light
lager
better
than
bmc
but
is
it
worth
the
extra
i
dont
think
so
i
didnt
mind
it
i
wouldnt
drink
it
that
often
but
it
was
somewhat
refreshing
it
might
be
a
shade
better
than
the
big
3
lights
but
that
doesnt
justify
the
high
prices
this
costs
in
the
category
of
light
beer
michelob
light
tastes
better
and
wont
cost
you
an
arm
and
a
leg
id
had
amstel
light
before
and
remembered
it
for
being
an
equal
substitute
to
heineken
after
todays
sample
i
can
think
of
few
beers
i
would
prefer
this
over
wow
the
best
light
beer
ive
had
but
maybe
im
just
easily
impressed
by
hops
in
a
light
lager
the
pale
malt
was
weak
but
there
was
an
actual
hops
profile
of
spicy
european
hops
the
aroma
was
actually
quite
big
for
a
light
beer
and
while
it
hinted
at
its
light
lager
style
with
adjuncts
the
pale
malt
and
hops
still
showed
through
really
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
only
light
lagers
that
actually
leaves
some
bitterness
in
your
mouth
still
this
beer
is
only
good
for
the
style
d
pretty
nasty
stuff
i
havent
tried
the
full
flavored
amstel
but
i
wont
touch
this
light
crap
ever
again
to
be
honest
i
dont
get
any
of
these
uppriced
light
beers
i
do
drink
light
beers
at
times
but
when
i
do
i
drink
miller
lite
and
of
the
ones
ive
mentioned
in
this
review
i
cant
say
i
will
be
switching
from
that
preference
for
miller
lite
any
time
soon
12
oz
bottle
in
a
boags
premium
pilsner
glassbarnacles
of
bubbles
cling
to
the
bottom
third
of
the
glass
after
an
overly
effervescent
head
dissipatesfor
how
many
amstels
ive
had
ive
never
sessioned
it
before
i
hear
some
snickers
from
my
serious
drinking
friendsstill
here
goesthe
tint
is
urine
yellowthe
aroma
is
unmistakable
northern
european
mass
production
although
some
slivers
of
nostalgia
are
embedded
in
that
smelland
then
the
tinswift
rush
through
the
mouth
no
palate
to
speak
of
the
consolationand
insultof
this
lager
is
simply
that
it
cries
for
some
sort
of
bar
food
to
interact
with
like
ketchup
this
beer
shouldnt
be
enjoyed
aloneoh
well
d
could
drink
alot
but
because
there
isnt
much
there
color
is
a
typical
ambergold
not
much
head
smell
is
fairly
substantial
and
malty
flavor
is
malty
and
pleasant
not
complex
a
little
watery
but
still
palatable
for
a
light
beer
this
actually
tastes
pretty
good
considerably
better
than
any
other
light
beer
ive
ever
had
at
least
one
feels
as
though
one
is
drinking
beer
and
not
beerflavored
water
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
mild
carbonation
smell
is
of
light
grains
and
a
hint
of
lime
like
smell
almost
light
struck
taste
is
of
course
very
light
but
there
is
some
light
strawish
grain
and
a
hint
of
citrus
zest
its
not
a
bad
beer
quenched
my
thirst
and
did
not
offend
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
though
because
of
the
price
and
the
low
abv
pours
a
light
golden
colour
with
just
a
little
too
much
head
lacing
was
a
tad
spotty
a
lot
of
carbonation
up
front
finishing
out
smooth
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
very
end
went
well
with
my
bratwurst
essentially
omnipresent
if
there
is
nothing
better
i
e
at
a
baseball
game
or
other
such
venue
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
djust
uninteresting
and
boring
though
inoffensive
overall
a
tad
better
than
your
usual
lights
d
not
very
tasty
simply
because
theres
not
much
to
taste
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
with
a
3
50
abv
theres
almost
no
kick
but
thats
essentially
what
this
style
is
for
however
there
are
definitely
better
light
beers
out
there
amstel
light
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
skunky
light
body
and
a
skunky
flavor
but
not
as
intense
as
i
would
have
imagined
doesnt
taste
like
much
really
a
little
skunk
toward
the
end
not
recommended
drinkability
if
i
want
to
drink
a
lot
i
could
drink
some
of
these
amstel
light
was
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
was
around
briefly
the
aroma
was
typical
massmarket
light
beer
malt
and
grain
the
taste
was
light
and
and
had
a
dry
finish
it
had
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
its
very
average
overall
for
massmarket
beer
an
acceptable
alternative
if
at
a
sporting
event
or
bar
that
lacks
interesting
inventory
a
average
light
beer
can
you
believe
it
retails
at
nearly
8sixer
not
really
worth
it
to
me
anyway
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
bright
white
head
and
a
skunky
smell
akin
to
grolsch
or
heineken
mouthfeel
is
near
water
levels
not
abad
for
a
light
beer
but
nowhere
near
sam
adams
light
what
can
i
say
about
this
one
a
little
malt
and
a
little
hop
bite
but
skunk
and
cooked
vegetable
dominate
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
and
the
drinkability
suffers
as
a
result
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
better
than
many
light
lagers
though
not
much
honestly
youd
be
better
off
getting
a
bud
light
id
rather
have
something
that
tastes
like
water
than
something
that
tastes
this
bad
id
say
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
the
last
bottle
i
had
of
this
a
couple
years
ago
was
just
as
bad
i
figured
my
palate
has
changed
a
bit
since
then
so
perhaps
id
retry
it
im
glad
i
did
but
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
brew
still
unfortunately
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
into
the
pilsner
glass
a
crystalclear
pale
gold
with
light
carbonation
and
a
finger
of
white
head
that
leaves
little
lace
the
aroma
is
quite
light
and
macroish
with
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
and
the
flavor
is
just
as
bland
with
maybe
some
corn
but
no
trace
of
hops
the
body
is
light
and
tingly
drying
with
a
short
finish
overall
not
much
more
than
carbonated
alcohol
water
might
as
well
drink
something
from
bmc
instead
of
paying
for
this
import
i
typically
avoid
light
beers
but
this
one
ill
make
an
exception
for
a
rather
typical
light
pale
yellow
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
that
lingers
a
bit
a
light
grainy
smell
and
a
hoppy
grainy
flavor
quite
pleasant
really
its
well
carbonated
but
is
clean
and
good
its
good
with
a
heavy
meal
or
when
you
are
trying
to
watch
your
calories
i
should
also
say
that
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
however
since
im
on
a
lowcarb
diet
right
now
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
at
5
8g
of
carbs
i
can
afford
to
drink
two
beers
in
a
day
instead
of
only
one
regular
beer
for
a
light
lager
it
is
definitely
above
average
and
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
think
the
ads
are
right
it
is
the
beer
drinkers
light
beer
the
beer
tastes
extermely
watered
down
and
has
no
flavoring
whatsoever
the
one
i
tried
didnt
even
pour
like
a
regular
beer
had
no
head
and
very
little
carbonation
if
youre
watching
your
calories
and
drinking
light
you
may
as
well
save
on
taste
and
have
a
glass
of
water
alysmith4nov

crisper
style
before
moving
to
this
on
a
regular
basis
a
good
kolsch
or
helles
is
a
better
choice
this
can
be
expensive
so
just
go
for
the
good
stuff

butterpopcorn
vegitive
and
corn
sugar
body
was
light
and
clean
finish
was
crisp
and
clear
no
true
flavors
pronounced
themselves
but
this
beer
is
good
at
washing
down
pizza
and
nachos
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
for
a
light
too
bad
its
not
a
good
flavor
nothing
impressive
at
all
here
im
not
sure
what
they
are
putting
in
this
beer
but
its
not
worth
the
7
99
they
are
charging
for
a
six
pack
i
would
recommend
pabst
blue
ribbion
over
this
any
day
i
mean
at
least
you
can
swallow
other
light
beers
without
really
tasting
anything
just
like
water
down
the
throat
and
then
forget
about
them
but
amstel
light
makes
sure
to
rip
a
blazing
trench
through
your
tastebuds
assuring
you
that
you
wont
forget
its
abhorrent
taste
any
time
soon
also
not
really
bad
as
an
after
mowing
the
grass
beer
to
cool
off
at
least
you
wont
get
too
buzzed
from
it
the
true
epitome
of
mediocracy
what
a
waste
if
i
wanted
water
i
wouldve
bought
water
poured
out
to
a
nearly
pathetic
yellow
clear
color
with
little
head
no
lace
and
rather
low
carbonation
scent
i
think
i
smelled
corn
and
hops
but
it
was
so
damn
light
it
couldve
been
a
dog
fart
flavor
was
very
weak
notes
of
corn
and
malt
finished
blandly
no
aftertaste
or
anything
this
beer
is
like
a
90
lb
halfback
its
just
not
gonna
cut
it
needs
more
flavor
much
more
flavor
could
be
reviewed
lower
but
i
was
not
repulsed
by
this
brew
maybe
only
the
inflated
price
not
recommended
drinkable
but
not
inspiring
another
one
that
i
can
enjoy
that
most
bas
hate
i
like
amstel
mostly
for
its
low
abv
its
better
than
bud
anyway
pours
a
very
golden
macrolike
yellow
smell
is
a
little
skunkygrassy
but
it
doesnt
linger
too
much
taste
is
very
thin
and
watery
malt
but
reasonably
clean
and
fresh
tasting
i
call
this
stuff
bird
beer
because
it
wouldnt
get
a
bird
drunk
its
still
ok
in
my
opinion
12
ounce
bottle
with
some
ungodly
freshness
dating
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
exciting
it
did
wet
the
old
whistle
though
i
used
to
love
this
beer
but
havent
had
it
in
a
long
time
and
now
im
not
sure
what
i
thought
was
so
great
about
it
but
then
again
i
dont
like
light
beers
anymore
either
i
feel
the
us
macros
are
light
enough
without
watering
them
down
even
more
this
one
is
very
pale
yellow
with
a
mediumsized
white
rapidly
diminishing
head
and
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
well
hardly
there
typical
of
a
light
beer
grain
light
malt
and
a
touch
of
dms
some
malt
and
the
smallest
dashes
of
hops
among
a
grainy
and
flavor
with
a
slightly
yeasty
yet
astringent
short
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
carbonation
is
quite
lively
its
not
that
great
of
a
beer
and
it
definitely
loses
some
points
for
its
cost
but
theres
still
something
about
it
i
like
i
dont
think
id
seek
this
one
out
very
often
but
i
had
it
after
going
for
a
run
earlier
and
then
eating
a
piece
of
pizza
with
too
much
red
pepper
sprinkled
on
it
and
it
was
just
what
i
needed
i
guess
thats
worth
something
right
that
and
its
not
completely
lifeless
like
the
bulk
of
the
light
beers
out
there
good
beer
that
starts
well
has
good
clean
balance
clean
refreshing
finish
great
after
hard
work
i
am
drinking
one
now
it
is
a
little
weak
but
still
a
good
available
beer
also
noteworthy
the
third
beer
is
as
good
as
the
first
that
quality
plus
the
fact
it
is
rather
cheeper
than
other
good
beers
makes
it
a
staple
at
any
bar
cripe
just
drink
lemon
water
and
save
yourself
95
calories
if
that
drives
your
beer
choices
in
the
end
i
highly
recommend
this
as
a
choice
for
those
who
want
to
be
more
sensible
in
what
beer
they
drink
yet
still
have
a
very
palateable
beer
pale
yellow
with
a
white
lace
for
a
head
not
much
aroma
some
grassy
grains
very
clean
taste
watery
with
some
light
grains
no
hops
very
light
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
to
mention
it
only
has
3
5
alcohol
per
volume
save
your
money
and
drink
some
bud
or
miller
light
the
taste
is
the
same
and
more
alcohol
for
a
lesser
price
pours
the
typical
clear
yellow
color
but
with
a
half
decent
white
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
skunky
like
a
typical
euro
lager
but
worse
the
taste
is
a
dry
mildly
bitter
flavor
with
a
sharp
skunky
tang
mouthfeel
is
barely
above
other
watery
versions
of
light
lager
with
a
typical
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
slightly
above
the
average
light
lager
with
a
drier
less
corny
flavor
not
a
bad
thirst
quencher
but
not
the
premium
classy
beer
drinkers
light
beer
as
its
marketed
drinkability
easy
drinking
light
beer
low
alcohol
content
ensures
that
one
can
drink
these
all
night
a
decent
beer
i
have
seen
in
cans
also
however
at
a
going
rate
of
around
6
99
to
7
49
a
six
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
for
what
you
get
why
buy
this
stuff
when
you
can
spend
just
a
bit
more
for
something
with
actual
flavor
yeeshhh
overallwere
it
not
for
the
price
amstel
light
would
probably
be
the
quissential
starter
beer
for
many
as
it
is
simply
more
flavorful
than
most
other
light
lagers
obviously
not
the
greatest
beer
out
there
and
it
is
expensive
but
i
do
give
it
props
for
being
among
the
more
flavorful
light
lagers
cheers
appearance
is
good
with
a
nice
head
and
for
a
lager
dark
colour
smell
is
for
light
beer
not
too
bad
but
litle
oxidised
and
not
much
malt
taste
is
empty
and
litle
oxidised
but
has
quiet
a
nice
maltarome
and
though
there
is
not
too
much
bitterness
for
this
beer
it
fits
and
is
pleasant
dont
know
if
the
revieuwed
beer
is
the
same
cause
on
my
label
it
says
amstel
lite
full
tastelower
calorie
overall
impression
eh
thin
and
weak
being
held
captive
on
a
plane
made
me
order
one
think
ill
stick
to
the
hiney
or
just
order
up
the
bloody
mary
next
time
pale
straw
color
with
a
blanched
white
head
that
fades
into
nothingness
faint
grain
and
rice
aroma
and
a
trace
amount
of
hops
discernable
in
the
aroma
watery
in
taste
but
the
malt
and
hops
that
do
come
through
in
the
other
4
of
the
fermented
barleypop
does
have
a
crisp
clean
flavor
surprisingly
no
offflavors
this
very
well
be
the
only
light
lager
ill
review
because
im
slightly
biased
against
light
beers
they
seem
to
me
like
an
anomaly
in
brewing
pair
it
up
with
some
spicy
food
and
this
beer
fairs
pretty
well
on
its
own
it
is
rather
average
even
for
a
light
beer
this
is
just
an
insult
to
the
word
beer
in
terms
of
both
the
3
5
abv
and
the
flavor
id
rather
be
drinking
water
its
a
shame
that
marketing
is
all
it
takes
for
a
company
to
get
rich
off
of
such
crap
the
body
is
lite
as
expected
with
small
fizzy
carbonation
flavor
is
caramel
and
general
sweetness
up
front
with
some
spicy
hops
coming
through
on
the
finish
the
beer
is
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
mostly
due
to
lite
body
and
general
mildness
of
flavor
not
the
best
beer
but
a
decent
lite
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
that
has
some
semblance
of
taste
then
this
will
not
disappoint
a
bit
shy
on
the
alcohol
though
just
not
a
good
beer
thank
god
there
was
only
1
left
in
the
cooler
i
know
why
my
girlfriend
drinks
so
much
of
this
it
tastes
like
nothing
and
there
is
hardly
any
alcohol
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
that
was
a
mistake
because
the
color
of
this
beer
wont
change
much
on
the
way
out
i
taste
hops
i
think
but
they
have
an
artificial
twist
to
them
the
aroma
is
of
skunky
beer
i
was
told
by
the
girlfriend
that
is
what
it
is
supposed
to
smell
like
while
not
high
on
my
list
i
can
still
understand
why
some
folks
would
drink
one
of
these
they
are
easy
to
drink
its
one
saving
grace
maybe
a
stretch
poured
a
light
yellow
white
head
aroma
i
think
i
smelled
somthing
maybe
some
hops
corn
flavor
next
to
none

just
wish
you
didnt
have
to
have
250
characters
to
rate
a

sept

2004
the
beer
is
simply
a
tasteless
yellow
fizzy
had
this
on
a
cruise
from
what
i
remember
there
was
not
much
of
a
head
and
was
a
golden
yellow
color
taste
reminded
me
a
lot
of
budweiser
which
is
not
truely
a
bad
thing
but
is
not
what
i
expect
from
an
import
while
i
was
not
completely
impressed
with
this
beer
it
was
not
all
that
bad
either
i
actually
had
a
real
good
time
drinking
these
especially
on
2
for
1
draft
nights
and
its
incredibly
expensive
and
you
can
drink
it
all
day
and
not
even
catch
a
buzz
since
its
abv
is
so
damn
low
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
if
you
have
to
go
for
a
light
beer
but
sam
adams
light
is
better
the
color
of
the
sand
at
a
new
england
beach
had
a
small
head
for
about
5
seconds
no
lace
smell
is
a
sandy
hop
leaf
just
one
and
it
is
kind
of
a
shriveled
runt
flavor
is
like
a
salty
desert
damn
i
cant
get
the
whole
sand
and
desert
idea
out
of
my
head
with
this
beer
it
is
just
so
dry
it
is
shocking
and
i
am
surprised
light
beer
drinkers
can
deal
with
such
bitterness
thin
body
with
some
zip
and
sizzle
that
smooths
out
at
it
sits
sort
of
refreshing
in
its
dryness
pretty
clean
better
made
than
most
light
beers
yet
still
far
from
desirable
did
i
mention
that
this
is
dry
overall
this
wasnt
too
bad
when
taken
into
the
context
of
a
very
hot
day
and
little
to
no
shade
plus
physical
activity
that
said
i
dont
think
ill
find
myself
drinking
this
brew
very
often
i
must
give
props
to
the
makers
of
amstel
light
for
marketing
this
as
an
imported
light
beer
so
they
can
charge
20
bucks
a
case
and
become
popular
in
the
states
this
is
a
watered
down
beer
if
you
can
call
it
that
pours
a
light
pale
yellow
with
no
head
smell
is
grainy
and
skunky
taste
is
of
slight
hops
with
a
watered
down
taste
no
body
at
all
not
drinkable
drink
water
if
thirsty
i
thought
i
would
never
say
this
but
i
would
have
rather
had
a
bud
light
than
an
amstel
light
that
should
put
into
perspective
how
much
i
disliked
this
beer
this
is
marketed
as
the
best
tasting
light
beer
in
america
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
average
flavor
kinda
like
a
jazzed
up
miller
lite
better
than
most
american
macrobrewed
lagers
but
for
the
price
ill
take
a
samuel
adams
any
day
of
the
week
did
i
mention
the
3
5
abv
yea
wtf
is
that
all
about
drinkability

on
the
cusp
of
being
poured
out
but
barely
hanging
on
only
positive
thing
i
can
post
about
this
beer
is
the
appearance
as
it
does
pour
a
nice
hazy
yellow
color
and
starts
off
with
a
nice
albeit
shortlived
head
taste
is
bitter
coppery
not
at
all
flavorful
seemed
lacking
in
carbonation
and
zing
mouthfeel
is
similarly
uninspired
i
could
only
drink
one
then
had
to
cleanse
my
palate
with
a
water
and
several
hoegaardens
this
is
to
beer
as
a
big
mac
is
to
fine
cuisine
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
overpriced
and
completely
tasteless
garbage
standard
pale
fair
here
smell
of
veggies
and
corn
bit
of
skunk
this
a
basically
a
light
version
of
a
heineken
but
with
less
skunk
flavor
is
dominated
by
corn
not
as
adjuncty
as
domestic
light
lagers
avoid
if
you
can
if
you
must
go
light
and
youre
not
paying
for
it
go
for
this
one
useless
this
was
free
and
still
wasnt
worth
drinking
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
is
one
of
the
better
light
beers
but
overall
it
is
watery
and
bland
i
can
drink
this
if
no
real
beer
is
available
but
it
is
still
a
light
neither
good
nor
bad
this
beer
just
is
really
its
so
close
to
average
that
theres
nothing
to
rip
severely
or
recommend
heartily
it
is
what
it
is
a
light
beer
with
more
flavor
than
most
other
light
beers
that
alone
gives
it
a
leg
up
on
the
competition
and
if
it
was
the
only
beer
offered
me
id
drink
it
because
in
spite
of
its
mediocrity
or
perhaps
because
of
it
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
when
alls
said
and
done
this
is
not
something
id
buy
for
myself
ill
just
cut
my
calories
elsewhere
this
is
a
very
bland
beer
whatd
you
expect
i
must
say
that
its
better
than
most
light
beers
out
there
especially
all
the
other
american
macro
light
lagers
it
has
a
light
golden
color
and
pours
a
thin
almost
not
there
head
it
smells
of
hops
and
some
malt
and
has
a
hopy
bitter
taste
but
its
a
little
watered
down
hence
the
term
light
after
the
name
pours
golden
yellow
fizzy
not
much
head
weak
aroma
subtle
caramel
and
mild
hops
its
funny
because
it
tastes
a
lot
like
odouls
amber
thin
but
nowhere
as
thin
as
something
like
coors
light
when
theres
no
other
choice
this
is
an
acceptable
beer
overall
i
am
fairly
ambivalent
about
amstel
light
im
not
a
particular
fan
of
light
beers
but
i
wouldnt
mind
being
offered
an
amstel
light
again
as
light
beers
go
this
is
one
of
the
more
flavorful
ones
its
abv
makes
it
right
above
na
beer
but
it
still
tastes
alright
came
in
a
12
oz
brown
bottl
which
is
what
a
idrank
it
from
had
a
pretty
good
malt
and
grain
flavor
that
gives
way
to
a
little
hops
that
taste
a
little
peppery
i
would
never
buy
this
unless
i
was
choosing
between
this
or
macro
lites
airplane
beer
this
is
the
stuff
that
you
can
get
on
nearly
every
flight
within
the
us
this
is
worse
in
cans
than
it
is
in
bottles
the
apperance
takes
a
hit
as
this
light
golden
brew
is
sitting
in
my
plastic
cup
and
the
aromas
are
more
subdued
as
well
i
still
smell
slight
malts
hops
and
seltzer
water
but
the
aromas
just
arent
as
strong
as
they
are
in
the
bottled
version
the
same
thing
can
be
said
about
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
remains
mor
and
the
drinkability
is
just
ok
im
really
not
too
crazy
about
this
beer
considering
the
amount
of
money
it
cost
i
was
not
too
impressed
it
had
a
decent
taste
and
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
overall
i
felt
a
little
let
down
it
looks
good
in
case
and
the
bottle
but
thats
where
the
fun
stops
id
drink
it
but
id
never
pay
14
bucks
for
a
twelve
pack
ever
again
the
light
beer
for
serious
beer
drinkers
or
something
like
that
this
beer
starts
out
like
a
good
looking
lager
with
a
crisp
golden
color
and
a
stiff
rocky
head
but
it
goes
downhill
after
that
the
beer
had
no
real
aroma
even
though
i
practically
dropped
my
nose
in
the
head
that
shortfall
continued
into
the
taste
with
none
really
present
no
rich
sweet
malts
no
tasty
classic
hop
flavor
nothin
the
beer
was
cold
and
i
thought
maybe
the
flavor
needed
time
to
open
but
as
the
beer
warmed
still
nothing
and
now
the
crispness
of
this
lager
began
to
fade
as
well
if
you
are
a
seriuos
beer
drinker
take
a
pass
on
this
lite
offering
smelled
like
old
pizza
dough
right
off
the
top
almost
no
head
skunky
skunky
flavor
with
the
added
bonus
of
that
metallic
light
beer
taste
like
a
nickel
has
been
dissolved
into
it
i
had
mine
for
free
at
a
nearby
reception
so
at
least
i
dont
feel
ripped
off
this
beer
is
a
golden
color
brew
white
head
to
top
it
off
there
are
some
grainy
flavors
slighty
malty
slight
hop
presence
the
company
will
tell
you
that
this
is
a
beer
drinkers
light
beer
which
may
not
be
far
off
except
that
beer
drinkers
dont
drink
light
beers
the
effort
they
spent
coming
up
with
a
decent
light
should
have
been
spent
coming
up
with
a
good
regular
beer
pale
and
clear
yellow
color
middling
head
at
best
laces
in
two
incomplete
rings
some
sulfur
to
the
aroma
some
of
cream
corn
aspects
malt
dominates
mouthfeel
is
light
along
with
carbonation
and
an
overall
graininess
the
malt
impression
is
fairly
impaired
hopping
is
decent
and
the
finish
is
crisp
better
than
the
beginning
some
metallics
in
later
sips
weak
upfront
and
a
little
strident
at
the
close
i
cant
say
its
very
good
even
for
the
category
i
hate
myself
for
buying
this
beer
this
beer
ruined
my
evening
well
almost
i
guess
i
should
just
be
grateful
to
have
beer
at
all
the
pale
flavor
and
light
hops
make
this
beer
a
little
week
the
beer
in
europe
taste
much
better
there
than
here
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
in
holland
not
a
very
good
beer
overall
but
one
of
the
top
light
beers
available
probably
only
bested
by
sam
adams
light
pours
a
light
light
amber
colour
and
pretty
much
lacks
any
and
all
characteristics
theres
a
minimal
grainy
malty
smell
and
taste
but
its
mostly
just
a
watery
brew
carbonation
is
low
so
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
rather
easy
to
drink
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
boring
if
i
have
to
have
a
light
beer
i
guess
an
amstel
will
do
husk
water
people
drink
for
two
main
reasons
1
to
enjoy
a
high
quality
brew
or
2
to
get
drunk
which
leaves
me
to
question
who
would
drink
this
crap
it
would
take
a
whole
lot
to
get
drunk
off
this
super
light
beer
also
there
is
no
real
taste
their
ad
says
the
beer
drinkers
light
beer
well
maybe
thats
true
if
the
beer
drinker
normally
drinks
coors
very
expensive
ripoff
probably
the
best
light
beer
available
in
the
us
it
is
smooth
and
maltier
than
any
other
lite
beers
and
has
a
nice
malt
finish
and
balance
throughout
if
you
want
to
drink
a
light
beer
without
sacrificing
taste
than
this
is
the
one
very
well
made
for
a
macro
but
being
an
import
henieken
seems
to
push
this
beer
and
with
good
reason
low
abv
makes
this
highly
drinkable
as
well
as
the
well
rounded
taste
average
drinkability
and
this
is
with
me
dieing
of
thirst
but
if
in
some
horrible
twighlight
zone
world
were
i
was
faced
with
this
or
a
whole
array
of
american
lights
i
would
take
this
another
weak
pea
colored
brew
with
a
white
head
of
small
to
large
bubbles
that
leaves
very
little
lacing
it
has
a
low
quality
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
getting
sick
to
my
stomach
oh
not
another
one
of
these
brews
it
has
a
very
small
hoppy
flavor
smooth
and
with
no
fore
or
after
bite
its
low
alcohol
content
is
also
not
a
plus
for
me
can
i
have
a
stout
please
gf
rating
said
it
smells
like
cheap
beer
looks
like
cheap
beer
so
it
must
be
cheap
beer
lol
notes
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
lack
of
calories
my
rec
walk
an
extra
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
and
treat
yourself
to
something
with
flavor
this
beer
poured
a
large
white
frothy
head
with
small
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
the
lacing
was
fair
with
this
beer
the
body
was
clear
and
had
a
straw
yellow
hue
it
had
a
light
hoppy
aroma
the
carbonation
was
lively
in
this
beer
the
flavor
was
bitter
tasting
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
thin
and
watery
this
beer
is
the
perfect
example
of
pedestrian
swill
i
have
been
drinking
various
ipas
and
stronger
ales
lately
i
had
an
arrogant
bastard
the
night
before
drinking
this
and
i
happened
to
enjoy
it
very
much
the
only
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
as
follows
someone
slipped
me
this
beer
and
by
the
time
i
realized
it
wasnt
really
bad
seltzer
water
i
was
finished
with
it
it
pours
with
all
the
characteristics
of
ginger
ale
with
heavy
carboatoin
a
largebubbled
head
and
no
lace
the
color
was
yellow
nothing
else
no
smell
no
taste
besides
the
worn
inside
of
an
aluminum
can
not
much
pleasing
about
this
beer
but
i
suppose
if
youre
on
a
budget
well
i
wouldnt
even
reccomend
it
for
that
situation
at
least
its
still
alcoholic
amstel
light
might
have
a
little
more
taste
than
some
domestic
lights
but
it
fails
to
offer
anything
that
would
put
it
above
that
class
as
it
is
still
quite
watery
the
flavor
seemed
very
grassy
to
me
for
some
reason
i
guess
this
is
a
somewhat
safe
beer
to
drink
for
those
new
to
beer
but
altogether
this
is
a
very
forgettable
beer
light
gold
color
large
head
aroma
is
grainy
hoppy
light
tasting
with
some
malt
flavor
kind
of
thin
mouthfeel
but
it
is
a
light
beer
so
it
sort
of
excueable
not
to
bad
not
to
good
typical
pilsner
taste
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
i
didnt
like
this
beer
upon
first
taste
it
pours
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
like
most
american
standard
beers
i
didnt
like
this
beer
after
my
first
pint
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
but
it
just
wasnt
as
enjoyable
as
some
other
lite
beers
ive
had
after
a
few
pints
i
found
that
i
still
didnt
even
have
a
buzz
come
to
find
out
this
beer
has
only
3
5
abv
no
wonder
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
who
thinks
they
can
get
drunk
off
of
it
nor
to
someone
who
is
looking
to
enjoy
their
beer
heineken
light
err
amstel
light
pours
a
slightly
amberish
yellow
for
a
light
beer
and
the
head
dissipates
quite
rapidly
there
is
no
real
aroma
at
least
not
that
i
could
detect
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
taste
is
not
bad
at
all
its
pretty
crisp
well
balanced
and
fairly
drinkable
ive
had
this
numerous
times
and
it
seems
like
there
is
an
odd
metallic
taste
to
the
first
few
swallows
of
this
one
but
it
seems
to
mellow
out
the
further
down
the
bottle
or
i
just
get
used
to
it
i
prefer
this
one
over
its
big
brother
with
the
red
star
but
still
not
one
i
would
seek
out
regularly
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
netherlands
can
keep
amstel
and
heineken
too
goddammit
went
out
drinking
with
a
friend
who
says
this
is
his
favorite
beer
personally
i
tend
to
drink
heavier
beers
and
love
sitting
in
the
beer
isle
at
lees
for
about
an
hour
before
making
my
desicion
but
we
had
just
worked
out
and
i
was
thristy
and
something
light
sounded
pretty
good
plus
i
need
to
keep
my
girlish
figure
i
didnt
bother
pouring
it
in
a
glass
well
because
i
wasnt
given
one
and
didnt
think
this
beer
really
needed
it
it
smells
like
a
basic
macro
taste
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
i
was
suprised
it
had
almost
a
little
sweetness
to
it
mouthfeel
was
crisp
light
and
refreshing
and
you
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
it
is
basically
is
a
typical
light
macro
but
its
at
the
top
of
the
list
as
far
as
those
go
drinkabilty
perhaps
my
review
is
slanted
towards
the
positive
side
based
on
the
fact
that
i
am
usually
parched
when
i
drink
this
beer
it
isnt
horrible
but
they
usually
disappear
quickly
i
just
dont
see
the
hype
why
pay
more
for
a
bad
import
when
you
can
have
bad
beer
cheaper
by
buying
american
crap
if
i
get
another
chance
at
a
luxury
suite
i
think
ill
go
with
amstel
light
an
openly
light
beer
you
pour
this
one
anywhere
and
it
could
pass
off
as
something
else
a
faint
yellow
colour
and
a
very
small
foam
head
youd
expect
some
smell
to
be
perceivable
but
you
can
notice
something
after
a
while
the
taste
is
no
better
a
poor
taste
where
the
most
perceivable
factor
is
a
faint
bitterness
heck
i
had
to
buy
this
to
get
change
to
pay
for
parking
my
car
i
sure
wont
buy
it
again
extremely
grainy
fragerancesmells
much
like
it
looksstraw
water
no
noticeable
hops
malts
or
any
other
flavor
watery
and
thin
if
you
are
one
of
those
people
who
pay
1
25
for
a
bottle
of
water
out
of
a
pop
machine
youll
probably
like
this
if
ever
offered
this
im
passing
mouthfell
is
somewhat
thin
which
is
expected
for
a
light
beer
if
i
was
forced
to
only
drink
light
this
would
be
an
ok
choice
luckily
we
are
free
to
choose
bland
a
bit
corny
a
bit
adjuncty
may
have
some
hop
flavour
i
couldnt
tell
a
touch
bitter
i
suppose
tastes
like
sparkling
mineral
water
just
an
even
lighter
version
of
amstel
the
normal
stuff
which
sounds
dissapointing
and
it
is
dissapointing
but
to
be
truthful
i
wasnt
expecting
much
in
the
first
place
its
hard
to
right
something
about
it
in
detail
boring
not
a
bad
brew
amstel
just
needs
to
address
that
aromataste
issue
but
not
a
good
brew
either
pours
out
a
clear
extremely
pale
straw
colour
a
thin
head
appears
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
of
euro
lager
grainy
malt
with
a
slight
bit
of
skunk
for
good
measure
actually
doesnt
smell
that
bad
well
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
because
it
really
is
lacking
in
any
redeemable
flavors
some
weak
fizzy
grainy
notes
and
a
ghost
like
hop
crispness
in
the
finish
it
really
is
a
weak
and
crappy
beer
really
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
is
a
quality
beer
even
among
the
light
ranks
save
your
money
and
buy
any
domestic
light
beer
and
you
wont
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
this
is
bad
as
mich
ultra
except
for
a
relatively
nicer
aroma
ugh
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
crisp
clean
taste
with
little
real
character
other
than
a
grain
sense
and
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
much
in
common
with
many
american
light
lagers
from
the
macro
brewers
but
cost
more
than
domestics
ill
give
it
an
extra
point
or
two
for
the
attractive
can
my
first
amstel
light
will
also
be
my
last
but
it
will
never
truly
be
enough
this
is
probably
the
plainest
clearest
beer
ive
ever
seen
the
head
dissipated
immediately
and
left
no
lacing
the
smell
was
dominated
by
a
skunky
grainy
aroma
i
could
pick
out
a
little
bit
of
malts
in
the
taste
and
maybe
a
bit
of
hops
bitterness
but
it
was
pretty
boring
the
aftertaste
was
a
little
bitter
with
a
sort
of
corn
like
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
highly
carbonated
and
not
very
enjoyable
i
would
not
drink
this
beer
again
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
eurostyle
long
neck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
server
in
a
pilsener
glass
the
beer
pours
archetypal
lager
color
a
translucent
gold
the
head
impressive
in
size
brilliantly
white
in
color
the
texture
creamy
and
the
lace
a
nice
fine
clinging
sheet
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
as
expected
all
malt
crisp
clean
and
lightly
sweet
as
it
the
start
top
is
skeletal
the
finish
is
perkily
acidic
the
hops
sparse
but
at
least
present
dry
aftertaste
and
a
decent
if
altogether
to
light
for
me
beer
but
not
at
all
bad
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
away
nose
is
very
similar
to
american
macros
taste
is
quite
bland
with
a
bit
of
corn
and
a
faint
hop
bitterness
finish
is
crisp
a
pretty
boring
beer
its
a
lot
like
drinking
a
glass
of
tap
water
personally
if
i
were
to
choose
a
light
beer
i
think
i
would
go
with
sam
adams
light
it
seems
to
have
more
of
an
aroma
and
a
better
overall
body
well
as
much
body
as
a
light
beer
can
have
but
i
will
drink
the
amstel
and
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
even
if
it
isnt
much
elmocoso
cheers
the
taste
is
lacking
but
it
is
bitter
with
some
malts
to
it
it
really
does
not
have
too
little
flavor
for
a
light
beer
but
you
know
how
it
goes
the
carbonation
is
also
not
overpowering
which
i
find
pleasing
you
can
drink
it
easy
clear
straw
gold
in
color
with
a
bright
white
head
that
holds
well
for
a
light
beer
the
aroma
is
of
an
herbal
lightly
earthy
hoppiness
the
body
is
light
with
a
median
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
crisp
the
flavor
expresses
the
same
herbal
hoppiness
as
the
aroma
well
entwined
with
a
light
grainy
and
dryish
malt
it
lingers
dryly
in
the
mouth
with
more
malt
and
hops
than
bitterness
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
let
me
put
it
this
way
i
had
a
free
bottle
at
a
reception
and
dumped
it
if
i
dump
out
a
beer
that
i
didnt
pay
for
you
know
there
is
a
problem
no
redeeming
qualities
whatsoever
unless
you
count
not
being
an
ab
product
on
pouring
it
is
slightly
darker
than
other
light
beers
but
the
head
falls
flat
quickly
there
are
no
percievable
hops
in
the
nose
only
that
badbeer
smell
its
way
too
carbonated
and
the
condition
is
only
made
worse
because
the
beer
is
really
thin
and
watery
slight
bitterness
from
hops
in
the
finish
along
with
something
else
that
can
only
be
described
as
a
grain
related
taste
the
only
reason
id
get
this
is
because
dennis
miller
did
some
ads
for
them
otherwise
ill
leave
it
for
those
who
believe
import
good
know
how
you
can
jam
6
skunks
in
a
bottle
me
either
but
amstel
knows
how
it
smells
really
skunky
pours
a
really
clear
golden
hue
with
a
1
12
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
fortunately
the
flavor
isnt
as
skunky
as
i
first
thought
from
the
smell
but
theres
at
least
12
of
a
skunk
in
there
maybe
a
tad
of
corn
taste
in
it
as
well
extremely
watery
mouthfeel
that
might
be
okay
on
a
severely
hot
day
it
is
drinkable
but
say
pbr
is
way
way
better
and
for
the
price
why
bother
with
this
stuff
i
cant
believe
i
did
for
a
light
beer
this
is
excellent
because
it
tastes
like
real
beer
by
that
i
mean
it
has
a
noticable
hop
nose
and
thirstquenching
hop
bitterness
and
a
faint
but
discernable
malt
character
with
no
noticable
adjunct
taste
this
is
what
a
light
beer
should
be
light
easy
drinking
and
actually
taste
like
a
beer
i
also
appreciate
the
brown
botttle
it
does
help
reduce
the
formation
of
skunky
flavors
and
i
can
tell
a
difference
in
amstel
light
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
decent
color
no
aroma
nor
real
flavor
and
definately
not
my
favorite
brew
but
when
i
feel
concious
about
my
figure
this
is
the
direction
to
go
light
golden
hue
and
clear
topped
by
a
head
that
persists
better
than
a
typical
adjunct
laden
macrobrew
light
theres
actually
a
hint
of
a
noble
hop
nose
while
a
mellow
and
clean
graininess
in
present
in
aroma
as
well
lightly
bodied
but
not
as
thin
as
budmillercoors
light
the
hop
bitterness
is
above
the
norm
for
style
and
adds
to
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
as
expected
for
such
a
light
beer
malt
complexity
is
lacking
but
the
lack
of
offputting
adjunct
flavor
contributions
make
this
beer
quite
drinkable
and
clean
for
a
light
the
grist
is
probably
all
barley
malt
although
light
beer
is
my
arch
nemesis
the
dutch
managed
to
eek
in
flavor
in
amstel
light
eurotrash
this
beer
looked
fine
and
inviting
pale
copper
color
thin
white
head
that
vanished
then
the
awful
skunky
smell
metallic
bitter
harsh
taste
just
bitter
taste
watery
and
acidic
then
nothing
on
the
finish
i
may
have
had
a
bad
can
but
this
beer
is
lousy
and
sadly
overrated
i
cant
agree
with
the
beer
drinkers
light
beer
slogan
it
will
be
hard
for
me
to
try
anything
else
from
amstel
despite
the
favorable
reviews
i
cant
believe
people
ask
for
this
not
bad
for
what
it
is
and
better
than
most
for
style
aroma
is
quite
pleasant
it
has
flavor
with
a
nice
european
quality
just
not
enough
all
light
beers
are
too
heavily
carbonated
for
my
taste
and
this
is
not
an
exception
its
a
light
beer
and
understanding
that
id
rather
drink
this
than
most
any
other
certainly
any
u
s
made
one
that
i
have
tasted
they
advertise
this
as
the
beer
drinkers
light
beer
i
dont
know
what
they
are
talking
about
this
beer
starts
promising
with
a
nice
amber
glow
and
moderate
head
it
quickly
falls
short
the
flavor
is
bland
and
somewhat
spritzy
i
just
doens
t
have
much
flavor
i
am
not
much
into
light
beers
i
found
this
beer
to
be
better
than
heineken
which
i
am
not
a
fan
of
due
in
large
part
to
the
skunky
smell
that
smell
isnt
as
prevelant
in
this
beer
which
makes
it
easier
to
drink
would
still
tend
to
look
for
a
different
light
beer
than
this
one
however
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
guess
i
bought
in
to
the
tv
adds
so
amstel
you
got
my
9
99
for
this
12pk
but
dont
look
for
any
more
skunky
smell
hits
you
before
the
beer
ever
reaches
the
mouth
then
the
skunk
smell
carries
over
to
the
taste
and
i
swear
if
i
didnt
pour
it
myself
i
would
have
thought
i
was
drinking
an
aged
schlitz
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
lean
in
for
a
sniff
is
that
its
kind
of
skunky
if
you
can
keep
your
nose
close
enough
long
enough
you
start
to
notice
a
little
maltiness
and
hops
peek
out
of
that
skunks
ass
then
the
skunk
hightails
it
into
the
flavor
after
a
few
sips
you
get
used
to
ol
mr
skunk
and
dont
notice
him
as
much
and
you
realize
that
the
commercials
are
right
it
doesnt
really
taste
as
bland
as
most
light
beers
its
got
some
definite
malt
presence
with
some
citrusy
notes
but
it
also
has
that
unpleasantness
separate
from
the
skunk
that
heinekin
also
has
but
i
cant
place
it
exactly
basically
i
wish
it
was
a
light
beer
so
it
wouldnt
be
so
damn
hard
to
drink
fast
because
it
becomes
near
undrinkable
when
it
starts
to
approach
anything
resembling
warm
this
is
usually
the
best
choice
of
wedding
beer
swill
i
like
it
in
relation
to
the
abs
and
coors
products
it
is
overpriced
and
has
a
slight
skunk
overtone
but
for
a
light
beer
it
does
have
flavor
and
that
is
what
is
usually
lacking
in
this
style
any
flavor
at
all
this
past
weekend
a
friend
brought
a
twelve
for
the
sailboat
cruise
and
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
i
would
not
be
a
regular
customer
but
will
buy
it
as
the
nonbeer
snob
alternative
for
my
parties
at
the
shore
my
wife
along
with
my
friends
without
taste
will
drink
it
notes
not
much
of
a
beer
to
hoot
about
just
an
other
run
of
the
mill
light
lager
at
around
2024
a
case
you
are
better
off
buying
a
domestic
light
lager
for
around
half
the
price
great
marketing
and
riding
with
the
imported
lager
trend
have
made
this
less
than
decent
brew
a
big
seller
in
the
us
one
of
the
better
tasting
light
beers
but
still
nothing
too
spectacular
if
you
are
going
to
be
drinking
cheap
light
beer
you
might
as
well
go
buy
a
case
of
nattie
or
beast
for
a
few
bucks
less
also
it
seems
every
other
case
has
a
few
skunky
brews
in
it
ive
never
understood
the
popularity
of
this
beer
if
you
want
a
light
beer
why
bother
with
an
import
that
is
always
partially
skunked
and
not
very
good
in
any
event
i
am
mystified
when
i
see
a
male
drinking
this
beer
the
only
message
you
are
sending
is
that
you
are
vain
worried
about
your
shape
and
not
real
bright
my
feeling
is
if
youve
got
a
tool
you
damn
well
better
build
a
shed
over
it
if
you
are
worried
about
the
calories
get
a
guinness
and
get
a
life
brown
bottle
bad
euroskunk
taste
and
aroma
golden
in
color
very
light
taste
not
as
watered
down
as
coors
for
sure
if
i
was
weighing
close
to
300lbs
i
would
choose
this
over
the
other
lights
that
i
have
tried
a
very
average
beer
but
good
as
far
as
light
beers
go
some
light
malt
taste
is
there
albeit
very
light
and
there
are
some
discernable
hops
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
but
for
the
same
amount
of
money
you
can
buy
so
much
better
this
was
a
gift
from
a
friend
since
i
never
had
it
i
see
why
now
way
too
light
and
watery
after
a
taste
a
shot
of
dark
rum
dressed
it
right
up
and
made
a
very
drinkable
drink
alittle
heavier
tasting
than
other
light
beers
but
with
a
light
peppery
aftertaste
not
bad
but
not
great
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
nothing
particularly
good
either
certainly
does
not
merit
paying
import
price
green
bottle
pouring
a
barely
golden
clear
color
with
half
finger
white
head
aroma
of
skunks
a
bit
of
hay
and
hops
flavor
followed
pretty
closely
while
this
was
mostly
just
water
flavor
it
had
an
unpleasant
skunk
flavor
and
rather
dirty
rough
lager
finish
light
mouthfeel
for
sure
but
i
wouldnt
choose
this
even
on
the
hottest
of
days
lots
of
carbonation
super
easy
to
drink
beer
not
offensive
just
nothing
going
on
beyond
a
faint
impression
of
a
light
adjunct
beer
and
lots
of
water
definitely
has
a
place
its
less
than
4
it
doesnt
taste
like
shit
its
worthy
when
you
need
to
cleanse
the
palate
or
its
super
hot
or
you
want
a
beer
but
you
have
to
drive
your
kid
somewhere
soon
the
pour
is
a
faint
golden
color
with
a
twofinger
white
head
that
dies
down
quickly
and
there
is
no
lacing
to
be
seen
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
grainy
husks
and
some
light
grass
the
taste
is
really
off
and
astringent
my
goodness
is
that
bad
peels
over
to
the
feel
and
is
just
wrong
does
not
taste
good
and
has
a
horrible
feel
this
is
just
a
bad
beer
and
im
glad
its
retired
pours
an
almost
competely
clear
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
very
faint
maybe
a
hint
of
grain
the
taste
is
very
light
there
is
a
sweet
malt
taste
with
a
very
little
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
there
is
nothing
to
stop
you
from
drinking
this
beer
however
the
is
really
nothing
to
it
either
the
faint
taste
would
grade
it
above
other
mass
produced
light
beers
sometimes
a
plain
beer
is
all
i
want
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
there
is
no
bad
aftertaste
and
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
it
actually
has
an
average
taste
for
a
mass
prodcued
beer
that
isnt
trying
to
break
any
rules
go
for
one
pours
very
light
and
clear
not
too
much
in
the
aroma
area
lots
of
carbonation
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
i
think
for
a
light
beer
very
drinkable
does
come
though
as
a
bit
bland
in
the
mouth
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
after
a
hot
day
working
in
the
yard
but
that
is
about
it
the
appearance
is
ok
with
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
and
no
real
head
or
lacing
smell
is
ok
a
bit
skunky
and
a
bit
of
hops
coming
through
taste
is
pretty
good
some
hops
and
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
the
skunkiness
is
gone
mouthfeel
is
too
light
but
not
awful
drinkability
is
good
drinkability
best
club
soda
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
doesnt
have
much
of
a
head
to
cover
the
clear
straw
yellow
color
light
grainybitter
smell
flavor
has
a
bit
of
yeasty
grains
with
a
very
faint
hoppiness
not
the
worst
malt
selection
light
body
and
very
fizzy
i
suppose
it
is
well
marketed
like
most
of
the
others
drink
it
cold
drink
it
very
cold
wow
probably
the
most
tasteless
beer
ive
ever
had
again
it
is
what
it
is
although
very
bland
even
in
comparison
to
other
light
beers
ive
come
across
latrobes
light
offering
does
score
for
being
what
it
strives
to
be
a
relatively
inexpensive
lowcalorie
lowcarb
light
offering
for
the
more
health
and
weight
conscious
drinkers
out
there
this
might
be
a
good
choice
but
if
youre
looking
for
flavor
and
style
just
pass
this
one
up
ever
had
schwepps
seltzer
water
thats
exactly
what
it
tastes
like
and
mostly
what
it
smells
like
on
one
hand
that
means
its
no
thinner
than
any
other
crappy
light
beer
yes
it
earned
itself
a
1
5
on
the
mouthfeel
category
because
its
no
worse
than
5
incredibly
wellselling
but
awful
beverages
but
for
someone
who
doesnt
care
what
their
beer
tastes
like
so
long
as
it
has
some
measure
of
alcohol
and
lets
themselves
keep
their
weight
down
it
serves
as
an
easy
to
choke
down
party
beverage
why
i
tried
this
i
will
never
know
i
hate
american
pale
lagers
and
especially
light
ones
virtually
no
taste
subtlety
or
character
bland
i
guess
this
was
an
attempt
to
keep
up
with
the
michelob
ultras
of
the
world
only
83
calories
i
would
rather
have
a
hefeweizen
packed
with
200
calories
than
tasteless
83
calorie
swill
anyday
at
first
i
thought
i
was
actually
drinking
a
no
alcohol
beer
but
i
found
out
it
was
3
7
abv
avoid
the
strangest
thing
though
is
that
it
just
tastes
like
it
was
brewed
from
nothing
that
normally
is
used
to
make
beer
i
have
no
idea
what
substance
this
was
concocted
with
but
it
just
doesnt
turn
out
right
completely
unpalatable
d
not
very
good
even
for
light
lagers
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
and
hardly
any
aftertaste
rock
green
light
pours
a
darker
golden
color
than
i
would
have
expected
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
thick
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
as
it
fades
the
aroma
is
adjunct
tastes
mostly
of
adjunct
maybe
a
little
hop
or
malt
toward
the
beginning
but
not
much
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
the
rock
lager
as
a
refreshing
drinking
beer
with
a
unique
flavor
compared
to
other
mass
produced
varieties
so
i
tried
one
of
these
lights
to
see
how
it
held
up
not
well
a
light
golden
color
with
a
ridiculous
arrangement
of
gigantic
bubbles
where
a
head
should
be
the
bubbles
burst
away
quickly
and
you
see
a
steady
light
carbonation
the
aroma
is
pretty
much
missing
in
action
maybe
a
touch
of
mustiness
although
the
83
calories
is
impressive
the
taste
value
took
a
big
hit
as
well
i
dont
sense
much
of
the
old
rolling
rock
flavor
here
just
a
hint
of
rice
no
corn
very
watery
fizzy
i
would
look
elsewhere
for
a
light
beer
if
i
really
needed
one
which
i
dont
rerated
3152007
sharp
and
clear
golden
yellow
beer
with
virtually
no
head
big
cooked
starchy
grainy
aroma
like
a
grain
silo
in
the
heat
of
summer
very
thin
body
virtually
no
flavor
just
a
bit
of
vegetable
and
malted
grain
not
much
here
maybe
not
as
bad
as
my
original
but
pretty
bad
original
rating
poured
stark
yellow
extremely
still
with
zero
head
starchy
aroma
literally
this
tastes
like
water
with
a
bit
of
grass
in
it
awful
yes
even
these
super
mainstream
beers
need
to
be
reviewed
plain
yellow
body
with
off
white
head
nose
is
a
slight
stink
that
is
faint
to
pick
anything
up
enters
the
mouth
and
you
just
keep
searching
for
a
distinguishable
flavor
so
you
wait
and
do
get
a
slight
yeasty
hue
on
the
end
twords
the
finish
very
crisp
overall
makes
a
refreshing
summer
waterlike
beer
style
good
beer
for
someone
who
doesnt
usually
like
beer
d
cmon
dont
do
it
to
yourself
the
only
reason
i
had
this
is
because
a
friend
had
some
and
didnt
want
it
and
i
took
one
to
write
this
review
horrible
sample
at
alefest
dayton
still
trying
to
figure
out
why
i
wasted
a
ticket
on
this
weak
straw
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
next
to
no
lacing
metallic
smell
lightbodied
with
hardly
any
flavor
or
substance
the
finish
is
watery
but
is
the
only
place
where
there
is
even
a
suggestion
of
hops
worthless
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
which
dissapates
ultra
fast
nose
is
filled
with
nasty
adjuncts
and
a
bit
of
veggies
very
thin
body
taste
is
adjuncts
grain
huck
followed
by
mettalic
notes
this
beer
is
not
a
good
example
of
the
light
beer
style
just
too
hard
to
drink
i
dont
recommend
this
one
another
leftover
from
the
family
gathering
very
pale
in
color
with
a
thinner
head
and
faint
lacing
aroma
is
grainy
and
husky
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
it
as
well
taste
is
not
as
watery
as
most
low
carb
beers
but
that
might
not
be
a
good
thing
here
dms
cooked
veggies
sulfur
seems
to
make
up
most
of
the
flavor
still
its
watery
a
bit
of
hop
extract
in
the
finish
not
quite
as
boring
as
some
in
its
style
but
still
not
enjoyable
another
green
light
please
yeah
whatever
if
you
are
extremely
thirsty
and
this
is
all
there
is
to
drink
still
pass
this
one
is
worse
than
its
parent
rolling
rock
its
a
bitter
skunk
of
a
beer
that
tastes
like
its
been
open
in
the
sun
for
a
day
and
thrown
in
the
freezer
to
get
cold
it
smells
kind
of
bland
w
a
egg
type
smell
i
think
i
may
buy
another
6
pack
of
this
to
use
as
gifts
to
my
enemies
with
that
said
it
was
easy
to
pound
one
down
if
i
didnt
think
or
taste
it
it
tastes
of
artificial
chemical
corn
to
me
looks
like
garbage
pale
white
beer
smells
like
watered
down
budweiser
feels
like
any
uberlight
beer
totally
undrinkable
overall
if
think
this
is
the
best
of
the
ultra
light
beers
aspen
edge
and
mich
ultra
light
gives
me
a
belly
achewater
not
this
i
mean
come
on
who
in
the
hell
wants
a
belly
ache
from
a
beer
i
mean
whats
the
point
yes
a
watery
beer
but
it
goes
down
easiely
with
just
enough
flavor
i
give
it
a
c
but
thats
just
me
in
my
opinion
miller
lite
over
this
there
is
very
little
to
note
about
the
taste
of
rock
green
light
which
shouldnt
come
as
a
surprise
to
anyone
the
taste
features
a
little
bit
of
graininess
corn
meal
and
crispness
with
a
sweet
profile
that
is
almost
completely
devoid
of
any
hop
flavor
there
is
almost
no
finish
at
all
and
the
weak
funky
aftertaste
of
grain
with
metallic
notes
lingers
for
a
while
after
drinking
i
have
recently
gone
on
a
lowcarb
diet
and
had
to
limit
my
consumption
of
real
beer
to
one
night
a
week
while
this
stuff
isnt
great
it
helps
stave
off
cravings
for
good
beer
one
of
the
few
choices
at
a
recent
labor
day
party
i
decided
that
id
give
it
a
try
fizzy
yellow
color
with
considerable
carbonation
and
a
slight
head
not
much
aroma
at
allmaybe
a
bit
of
corn
and
cereal
grains
but
very
faint
no
noticeable
hop
quality
in
any
respect
its
a
hollow
watery
unsatisfying
beer
this
was
one
very
light
very
unremarkable
experience
like
a
lot
of
light
beers
theres
nothing
particularly
bad
to
say
since
theres
no
notable
flavor
at
all
heavily
pushed
recently
and
although
i
havent
like
a
single
rr
i
decided
to
try
it
anyway
i
was
somewhat
suprised
it
was
quite
tolerable
light
crystaline
yellow
pour
with
a
hole
filled
thick
head
that
faded
quickly
smelled
like
corn
on
the
nose
and
didnt
wreak
or
smell
soured
barely
any
taste
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
no
notable
aftertaste
somewhat
dry
thin
but
not
too
thin
nothing
offensive
though
if
youre
going
for
negligable
calories
this
is
about
as
good
as
you
can
get
d
very
easy
to
drink
like
sparkling
water
but
who
wants
to
drink
that
all
night
as
far
as
lowcarb
beers
go
this
one
is
better
much
better
than
michelob
ultra
in
fact
now
there
is
nothing
for
taste
though
but
it
is
missing
the
artifical
tastes
i
find
in
other
lowcarb
light
beers
it
tastes
like
it
looks
a
few
ounces
of
beer
added
to
about
9
ounces
of
water
it
really
does
taste
like
a
slightly
alocholic
seltzer
water
past
that
it
is
pretty
drinkable
meaning
you
can
drink
many
of
these
if
you
are
an
avid
drinker
you
could
easily
pound
a
12pack
without
thinking
twice
i
find
this
beer
to
be
great
for
woman
drinkers
because
well
they
stole
most
of
my
6pack
that
i
had
bought
and
well
i
didnt
complain
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
huge
carbonation
one
of
these
was
plenty
to
make
up
my
mind
drinkability
the
carbonation
is
about
the
only
thing
keeping
you
from
downing
the
whole
bottle
in
one
shot
yeah
sure
its
drinkable
when
youre
thirsty
but
so
is
water
only
thing
really
good
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
its
probably
the
best
of
the
lowcarb
fad
brews
beating
out
aspen
edge
and
mich
ultra
but
that
doesnt
really
say
anything
it
also
doesnt
make
the
mister
throw
tantrums
i
agree
pretty
much
with
riversider
it
is
a
very
pale
fizzy
water
without
much
taste
at
least
it
got
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
to
change
from
stronger
beers
i
know
rolling
rock
is
not
the
best
quality
products
availables
on
the
market
but
i
still
like
to
have
one
of
them
once
in
a
time
fizzy
water
with
a
slight
hint
of
a
bad
beer
taste
nothing
like
regular
rolling
rock
not
much
of
a
head
not
much
of
anything
i
would
not
drink
this
beer
again
rolling
rock
failed
in
their
low
carb
offering
you
would
be
better
off
with
a
diet
coke
well
this
one
is
a
little
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
it
pours
the
expected
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fastly
dissipating
white
head
the
smell
is
nice
considering
the
style
of
beer
smells
better
than
a
budweiser
if
thats
saying
much
the
initial
taste
when
the
beer
first
hits
your
palate
is
impressive
and
reminds
me
much
of
a
german
pilsener
this
is
of
course
quickly
washed
away
with
a
watery
fizzy
extra
bland
flavor
no
body
whatsoever
considering
my
experiences
this
must
be
impossible
to
avoid
when
making
a
lowcarb
beer
atleast
this
one
is
better
than
michelob
ultra
martens
and
becks
premier
light
pretty
good
for
a
low
carb
beer
but
not
much
at
all
in
the
worlds
totem
pole
of
beers
ps
i
didnt
finish
my
bottle
i
just
couldnt
do
it
hell
i
needed
an
ipa
to
kill
the
aftertaste

looks
clear
and
lightly
straw
high
carbonation
with
a
fizzy
head
that
fell
remarkibly
fast
a
lot
like
7up
aromas
are
almost
nonexistent
faintly
of
malt
corn
and
light
strikeness
taste
is
just
there
it
tastes
like
a
watered
down
bud
light
but
without
the
metalic
taste
finish
is
very
clean
and
crisp
aftertaste
is
nill
body
and
mouthfeel
is
the
same
as
alkaselzer
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
the
same
way
that
carbonated
water
is
im
not
certain
that
there
is
even
any
alcohol
in
it
all
in
all
to
me
its
the
best
of
the
low
carb
stuff
out
there
and
second
best
light
beer
poured
a
very
pale
amber
color
with
white
head
smell
is
minimal
and
slightly
sweet
there
is
very
little
taste
but
at
least
its
not
offensive
mouthfeel
is
virtually
not
there
the
perfect
beer
to
drink
if
you
are
thirsty
but
theres
no
water
available
rock
green
light
is
proof
of
the
mind
control
that
is
perpetrated
on
the
populous
by
the
fad
diet
crowd
it
is
amazing
that
latrobe
sells
quite
a
bit
of
this
stuff
i
see
stacks
of
it
in
every
store
i
enter
i
guess
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
lawnmower
beer
for
those
people
watching
their
carbs
poured
out
to
a
weak
yellow
color
with
medium
high
carbonation
and
no
head
to
speak
of
as
it
fizzed
away
before
i
got
a
chance
to
take
a
good
look
at
it
no
smell
really
i
didnt
smell
a
thing
maybe
water
taste
was
similar
with
a
touch
of
hops
finished
like
seltzer
water
i
dont
get
this
beer
i
guess
itd
be
refreshing
for
some
me
i
found
it
one
sided
and
kind
of
boring
good
for
those
on
the
atkins
though
i
must
say
if
the
world
was
filled
with
only
low
carb
beers
this
would
probably
be
my
choice
still
thats
a
dreaded
day
i
hope
we
never
come
to
i
do
not
like
michelob
ultra
i
do
not
like
rolling
rock
green
light
i
will
not
drink
them
anymore
on
a
flight
i
will
not
drink
them
anymore
while
flying
a
kite
i
will
not
drink
them
anymore
day
or
night
whatever
it
is
it
would
probably
be
drinkable
ice
cold
on
a
really
hot
day
with
the
air
conditioner
out
and
nothing
else
available
not
good
this
beer
is
mostly
flavorless
i
do
detect
a
hint
of
limeyskunk
aftertaste
while
is
isnt
as
bad
as
corona
it
has
a
distinct
unpleasent
aroma
and
aftertaste
as
far
as
low
carb
beers
go
this
isnt
that
bad
but
it
isnt
good
either
just
average
on
tap
at
old
chicago
as
part
of
spring
mini
tour
i
can
appreciate
a
rolling
rock
on
occasion
but
never
understood
the
need
for
rolling
rock
light
now
there
is
a
rolling
rock
light
light
this
tastes
like
rolling
rock
diluted
with
water
still
maintains
the
typical
green
bottle
taste
but
not
much
else
ill
take
the
extra
carbs
and
some
actual
taste
next
time
please
who
in
the
world
drinks
this
stuff
more
than
once
rock
red
light
would
be
a
much
more
appropriate
name
and
is
how
ill
think
of
this
beer
from
now
on
if
i
even
think
of
it
at
all
if
you
find
yourself
considering
a
purchase
picture
a
big
blinking
red
light
and
for
the
love
of
good
beer
stop
before
you
do
something
that
youll
regret
i
do
purchase
rolling
rock
its
not
outstanding
by
any
means
but
a
change
of
pace
from
the
big
three
i
cant
beleive
anything
this
bad
comes
from
the
glass
lined
tanks
of
old
latrobe
for
a
low
carbohydrate
light
beer
rock
green
light
actually
has
some
pleasing
characteristics
what
little
taste
is
there
i
find
likable
ok
i
am
embarassed
to
even
write
a
review
on
this
beer
but
if
it
saves
one
person
from
spending
their
money
on
it
than
i
have
done
my
job
have
you
ever
tasted
what
you
would
call
a
watered
down
beer
well
that
phrase
is
never
more
true
than
with
rolling
rock
green
light
it
taste
like
sparkling
water
no
head
no
smell
no
taste
no
color
nothing
it
would
serve
to
cool
the
mouth
on
a
hot
day
and
that
is
about
it
might
as
well
drink
water
out
of
the
tap
i
have
friends
that
leave
beer
in
my
fridge
that
i
would
never
think
of
buying
so
i
figure
that
if
it
is
there
i
should
give
it
my
opinion
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellowgold
color
but
it
is
actually
darker
than
i
would
have
expected
for
a
low
carb
beer
still
it
is
not
anything
to
write
home
about
there
is
no
head
to
speak
of
and
not
much
of
a
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
awful
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
it
smells
like
sweet
vomit
to
me
i
am
not
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
offering
im
not
a
fan
of
the
original
so
the
low
carb
option
cant
be
any
better
ok
here
we
go
the
taste
is
a
watered
down
sweetness
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
but
that
is
not
saying
much
i
dont
like
it
there
is
more
flavor
in
this
one
than
in
mich
ultra
but
i
would
rather
the
flavor
of
this
beer
be
absent
the
beer
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
burning
on
my
tounge
i
dont
know
if
i
can
even
finish
this
one
so
drinkability
shouldnt
be
much
of
a
question
having
tried
the
mich
ultra
i
would
have
to
say
that
even
though
it
is
more
like
water
the
mich
ultra
is
a
beter
offering
conlusion
if
you
want
a
really
cheap
low
carb
brew
try
this
one
i
would
probably
go
with
the
aspen
edge
but
this
one
is
prettty
close
tastless
seltzer
waterlike
mouthfeel
and
flavor
nothing
there
to
talk
about
nonalcoholic
brews
are
tastier
than
this
swill
probably
the
worst
tasting
low
carb
beer
of
them
all
im
not
a
fan
of
the
whole
low
carb
craze
but
i
try
and
judge
beers
for
their
style
and
not
my
personal
tastes
that
said
this
beer
sucks
ass
bland
has
can
be
and
it
has
an
odd
bite
in
the
finish
just
steer
clear
drinkabilitynotes
i
dislike
bashing
any
beer
but
this
one
is
a
beer
in
name
only
the
concept
of
a
low
carbohydrate
beer
is
in
my
opinion
ridiculous
as
several
have
said
eat
a
little
less
junk
food
and
drink
a
real
beer
24
ounce
can
crystal
clear
golden
hue
thin
pure
white
head
some
decent
patchy
lacing
left
at
the
end
of
the
drink
decent
will
be
the
only
positive
adjective
for
this
beverage
an
also
crystal
clear
aroma

dish
soap
absolutely
horrible
a
smell
that
worsens
as
it
gets
closer
to
your
senses
up
front
watery
thin
spritzy
minimal
flavoring
intensely
carbonated
maybe
some
hop
detection
yet
thats
stretching
the
boundaries
combined
with
your
typical
macrobeer
offerings
almost
has
some
perfumelike
tastings
the
ingredients
of
this
beverage
i
do
not
want
to
know
what
they
put
in
this
should
eventually
end
up
close
to
the
top
a
certain
ba
ranking
chart
one
to
avoid
at
all
costs
the
green
light
puts
a
bad
label
on
the
rock
this
is
drinkable
like
water
and
probably
about
as
alcoholic
makes
odouls
taste
good
in
comparison
very
pale
yellow
plastic
wrap
clear
with
a
glowing
sense
in
the
late
afternoon
marginal
head
mostly
a
ring
with
some
slight
lacing
properties
sticking
to
the
glass
in
strings
mouthfeel
is
abysmal
in
heft
but
the
carbonation
is
more
subdued
than
michelob
ultra
some
listerine
aromatics
interfere
with
the
skeletal
malt
corn
syrup
in
neutrality
but
very
hidden
smell
balances
as
much
as
hops
and
the
finish
is
like
a
disappearing
act
completely
void
not
as
fizzy
in
the
stomach
as
some
well
the
aroma
is
worst
but
theres
not
a
lot
good
happening
here
as
close
to
soda
a
beer
is
going
to
get
i
would
have
to
say
its
more
akin
to
ginger
ale
than
beer
i
have
never
had
a
beer
as
colorless
as
this
even
moreso
than
sleeman
the
taste
was
almost
of
water
ubt
there
was
a
faint
hint
of
corn
no
woth
a
penny
in
my
book
wow
this
is
perhaps
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
sampled
not
because
of
poor
flavour
or
even
poor
craftsmanship
necessarily
but
because
its
almost
mot
beer
its
more
like
liquid
air
and
is
the
closest
beverage
to
water
that
ive
ever
tried
thats
not
actually
water
pours
a
damn
near
clear
yellow
i
could
easily
see
with
detail
everything
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
smell
huh
did
i
miss
something
no
characteristics
to
speak
of
here
i
couldnt
give
the
taste
a
1
0
because
it
wasnt
awful
it
simply
didnt
taste
like
anything
liquid
nothing
blah

rather

rather
die
merely
a
skeleton
of
what
beer
is
supposed
to
be
the
mental
image
i
get
from
what
this
beer
would
look
like
as
a
person
is
something
akin
to
eddie
on
the
covers
of
the
iron
maiden
albums
emaciated
papery
skin
stretched
taut
against

ghoulish
coutenance

absolutely
ghastly
dont
let
the
atkins
hype
poison
your
brain
theres
just
no
excuse
for
drinking
crap
like
this
obesity
included
this
is
some
great
tasting
water
and
it
made
my
teeth
feel
clean
and
fresh
for
anyone
expecting
a
beer
forget
it
i
have
never
ever
tasted
a
product
so
devoid
of
any
beer
character
as
this
and
mich
ultra
ive
tasted
nas
that
are
better
than
this
ok
do
i
have
to
give
a
legit
review
here
goes
pale
poor
head
that
fades
no
taste
feels
like
seltzer
water
finish
reminiscent
of
baking
soda
feels
like
water
in
the
tummy
over
all
i
would
say
that
the
beer
was
a
nice
try
by
latrobe
i
dont
think
you
could
make
a
beer
taste
good
while
trying
to
cut
some
of
its
most
important
properties
for
me
it
will
be
the
guinness
diet

draft
has
125
calories
and
10
grams
of
carbs
and
is
a
real
beer
labtrobes
entry
into
the
low
carb
market
amazingly
retains
the
dms
character
theyre
known
for
while
almost
completely
eliminating
everything
else
its
a
great
looking
glass
of
beer
it
even
leaves
some
lace
and
its
effortless
to
consume
just
like
water
but
its
almost
entirely
devoid
of
any
flavor
in
fact
it
seems
like
watereddown
rolling
rock
light
but
there
are
no
flaws
in
it
other
than
what
they
intended
they
wanted
the
dms
light
body
and
lack
of
flavor
so
it
cant
score
all
the
way
at
rock
bottom
in
fact
for
a
lowcarb
beer
its
pretty
good
in
comparison
but
for
the
amount
of
carbohydrates
youre
saving
its
just
not
worth
it
go
for
the
regular
rolling
rock
but
have
one
less
potato
chip
and
youll
still
be
way
ahead
of
the
game
this
is
still
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
say
michelob
ultra
but
beers
like
these
are
not
worthy
of
a
real
beer
drinkers
attention
ignore
this
beer
with
extreme
prejudice
drinkability
is
peak
if
its
hot
out
and
you
need
a
quencher
but
i
wouldnt
choose
this
one
for
any
seasonal
parties
this
winter
except
maybe
for
shock
value
heh
heh
wow
what
a
bad
beer
i
drink
a
ton
of
rolling
rock
when
the
bartender
said
it
was
all
warm
and
i
could
have
the
green
light
for
free
till
a
rr
hit
a
lower
temp
i
said
sure
what
a
mistake
try
watering
down
rr
and
adding
some
nasty
solvent
to
it
on
the
plus
side
you
may
well
lose
weight
drinking
this
beer
since
its
so
nasty
you
cant
drink
very
many
if
you
want
low
carb
go
mich
ultra
its
drinkable
if
you
lost
your
tongue
in
some
horrible
work
accident
this
pours
out
to
a
decent
looking
bright
yellow
actually
much
brighter
than
i
expected
a
light
beer
to
be
however
this
is
where
the
positives
end
the
aroma
is
that
of
overcooked
veggies
and
cooked
cereal
the
taste
reminds
me
of
soda
water
with
some
beer
flavoring
essentially
next
to
nothing
tastewise
i
know
people
want
to
hang
on
the
lowcarb
diet
fad
but
eat
healthy
and
drink
good
beer
this
isnt
worth
the
time
or
effort
to
drink
oh
my
what
a
beer
pours
the
lightest
colour
i
have
ever
seen
on
a
beer
the
nose
is
almost
non
existant
and
smells
of
well
water
the
taste
is
well
quite
frankly
there
is
no
taste
the
taste
consists
of
a
whisper
of
beer
flavour
with
the
carbonation
of
tonic
water
the
finish
dissapears
almost
instantly
squeeze
a
lemon
in
it
and
and
you
have
spritzy
lemon
beer
water
i
thought
ultra
was
insipid
but
this
stuff
goes
to
a
new
depth
of
lack
of
flavour
should
be
marketed
as
a
malternative
no
beer
here
well
as
i
just
could
not
resist
buying
this
light
beer
i
most
certainly
got
what
i
paid
for
a
light
beer
the
pour
is
a
transpicuous
gold
color
with
the
head
a
creamy
white
and
modest
in
size
lace
a
nice
thin
sealing
sheet
nose
is
crisp
and
clean
start
is
lightly
sweet
with
the
top
cadaverous
in
feel
finish
is
brisk
in
its
carbonation
hops
are
quite
light
the
aftertaste
dry
just
what
you
would
expect
from
a
light
beer
nothing
but
hell
i
was
thirsty
and
it
was
only
a
1
19
my
god
what
were
they
thinking
in
latrobe
when
they
created
this
brew
i
really
cant
find
anything
good
about
this
beer
it
pours
out
to
an
extremely
pale
yellow
and
one
can
definetly
smell
the
adjuncts
in
it
as
for
the
taste
or
lack
there
of
it
is
horrible
i
will
not
hesitate
to
say
that
this
is
officially
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
very
pale
golden
color
with
a
crisp
white
head
decent
sized
head
that
fades
rapidly
to
nothing
large
carbonation
tries
to
sustain
the
head
but
is
fighting
a
losing
battle
smell
is
a
little
sweet
and
very
clean
taste
almost
non
existent
a
touch
of
malt
with
a
lingering
sweetness
on
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
like
carbonated
water
drinkability
well
it
goes
down
better
than
many
municipal
water
supplies
but
isnt
all
that
enjoyable
but
a
great
summer
thirst
quencher
id
almost
call
it
a
nearbeer
but
it
does
have
some
alcohol
although
it
doesnt
show
in
the
taste
not
offensive
but
why
bother
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
surprisingly
thick
and
creamy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
nice
amount
of
lace
the
use
of
adjuncts
is
very
apparent
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
a
cooked
veggie
aroma
very
light
and
thin
in
body
taste
is
sweet
corn
and
cereallike
grain
husks
followed
by
some
metallic
notes
this
was
my
first
and
last
time
to
have
this
beer
this
makes
regular
rolling
rock
seem
outstanding
but
this
light
is
an
embarrassment
please
remove
it
from
your
stable
ok
colour
is
nice
light
golden
very
limited
head
with
some
minor
glass
cling
the
body
is
thin
and
the
taste
is
well
balanced
but
frail
this
brew
has
no
personality
it
saddens
me
its
only
good
point
was
that
it
made
me
hunger
for
a
r
r
light
of
lights
why
bother
with
this
when
tap
water
will
do
if
i
am
ever
this
desperate
for
alcohol
again
i
will
drink
listerene
very
light
color
no
taste
you
could
brush
your
teeth
or
shave
with
this
beer
i
have
to
go
with
psugrad98
on
this
one
while
it
is
readily
available
here
in
pennsylvania
that
does
not
exactly
mean
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
it
is
pale
has
little
aroma
and
tastes
just
like
it
looks
and
smells
proceed
with
caution
why
why
why
why
why
why
would
i
even
try
this
beer
give
every
beer
a
chance
and
remember
to
never
do
anything
this
foolosh
again
notes
is
this
really
a
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
tastes
like
creamed
corn
has
no
malt
or
hop
flavour
then
sticks
you
with
a
nastyass
aftertaste
you
can
have
the
other
5
beers
in
my
sixpack
was
about
to
brew
a
lighter
blonde
ale
in
this
srm
3
range
so
i
picked
up
a
bunch
of
different
varieties
for
inspiration
this
was
my
favorite
surprisingly
it
was
one
of
the
lighter
offerings
but
it
had
that
something
different
that
kept
me
going
back
to
it
it
pours
light
gold
with
a
5
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
has
nice
lacing
and
a
brisk
spritzy
innercarb
tastes
like
a
decent
macro
lager
with
a
nice
funky
yeastkick
its
a
weird
almost
cloying
soursweet
funk
to
it
that
makes
it
original
and
interesting
lets
face
it
this
style
is
hard
to
make
interesting
but
that
yeast
funkiness
going
on
doesnt
taste
like
a
paulaner
but
it
does
kinda
remind
of
that
originalfunk
quality
thats
nice
and
it
does
set
this
apart
in
a
usually
boringbland
category
it
might
be
slightly
underrated
here
slightly
a
good
summer
beer
beef
it
up
with
a
bit
of
grain
of
paradise
bite
and
youd
have
yourself
a
winner
and
get
rid
of
the
twist
offs
pls
dont
like
buying
bottles
i
cant
recycle
for
homebrews
bright
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
haziness
from
some
light
sediment
a
quarter
inch
head
of
off
white
foam
is
on
topbut
quickly
fades
brussels
lacing
aroma
is
of
light
maltrice
and
perhaps
some
faint
bittering
hops
flavor
is
light
maltrice
and
some
faint
saaz
hops
this
beer
is
daily
light
in
body
and
fairly
crisp
not
usually
a
fan
of
lagers
but
this
one
has
a
good
flavor
with
a
touch
of
hops
on
the
back
of
your
tounge
smells
of
a
wheat
beer
maintains
a
smooth
flavor
even
as
the
bottle
warmed
unlike
a
real
hoppy
beer
pairs
good
with
a
beef
dish
like
steak
pours
a
clear
straw
color
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
hint
of
wheat
rice
and
a
hint
of
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
light
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
rice
pale
malt
hint
of
hop
and
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
overall
decent
appearance
aroma
and
blend
for
a
light
lager
but
the
bottle
clearly
states
blonde
ale
and
is
therefore
a
poor
american
blonde
ale
overall
not
offensive
but
ive
had
this
style
before
and
it
comes
off
as
sweetened
cereal
honey
bunches
of
oats
o
for
such
a
light
beer
it
still
has
decent
flavor
that
is
certainly
better
than
bmc
again
if
you
know
someone
looking
to
get
into
craft
beers
but
are
scared
of
the
heavy
flavors
this
is
a
good
start
this
isnt
bad
for
what
it
is
its
probably
brewed
for
the
macrolager
and
its
better
than
most
in
that
class
its
not
a
bad
lawnmower
beer
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
slight
bit
of
foam
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
smells
of
pilsner
malt
lemongrass
very
sweet
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
smell
very
basic
with
a
slight
bit
of
pilsner
taste
to
it
has
a
very
bready
aftertaste
lightmedium
in
body
low
carbonation
for
the
style
nothing
impressive
here
good
starter
beer
for
those
who
only
drink
pbr
miller
and
bud
taking
into
consideration
unless
youre
at
least
50
you
dont
bother
with
coors
anymore
and
that
would
be
coors
original
not
light
o
pleasant
drink
good
alternative
to
the
bmc
but
still
a
bit
plain
o
not
totally
disappointing
but
nothing
i
would
grab
again
this
blonde
doesnt
get
down
and
dirty
but
i
am
sure
you
could
make
up
for
that
by
doing
it
all
night
long
hopefully
the
horns
wont
wear
off
but
i
think
i
might
get
tired
of
it
and
want
something
with
more
character
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
that
you
could
drink
all
day
long
this
tastes
more
like
a
blonde
ale
than
a
light
lager
not
as
horrible
as
the
label
looks
or
the
beer
sounds
pours
a
clear
brilliant
golden
color
with
a
bright
white
head
forms
thin
speckled
lacing
as
it
dwindles
aroma
has
light
biscuit
malts
with
a
light
herbal
hop
in
the
back
end
nothing
overtly
sweet
or
offensive
here
flavor
has
a
creamy
malts
sweetness
with
massive
cereal
notes
and
a
bit
of
cooked
veggie
light
herbal
hops
in
the
back
end
with
some
dry
yeast
cake
chalkiness
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
a
bit
fizzy
and
a
bit
yellow
nothing
markedly
better
than
anything
mainstream
or
worse
than
anything
out
there
that
is
super
craft
overall
it
was
bearable
but
nothing
really
exciting
or
well
executed
as
a
honey
blonde
lager
affordable
and
inoffensive
this
lager
is
a
serviceable
beer
could
be
paired
with
just
about
anything
and
would
go
just
fine
along
with
greasy
bar
food
or
lighter
seafood
dishes
o
a
good
tasting
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
i
love
this
beer
it
is
a
extremley
refreshing
lager
there
is
the
perfect
amount
of
hop
presence
and
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
beer
it
has
a
high
abv
and
a
much
better
taste
than
most
light
lagers
if
someone
is
looking
to
slug
beers
all
day
long
but
not
compromise
taste
this
is
a
great
choice
overall
another
horny
goat
offering
that
i
dont
mind
drinking
but
likely
wont
purchase
again
not
bad
just
so
many
better
options
overall
this
has
an
overall
fake
flavor
about
it
this
one
comes
across
as
just
another
macro
type
beer
for
the
masses
skip
this
one
o
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
certainly
not
a
belgian
style
or
yeasty
but
as
a
stand
alone
entry
level
light
sippin
tweener
will
suffice
for
one
or
two
bought
as
a
part
of
a
sampler
pack
average
all
around
its
really
pretty
smooth
and
its
got
more
flavor
especially
hops
than
i
was
anticipating
so
for
that
i
give
it
credit
its
not
an
award
winner
but
it
is
gone
in
2
minutes
and
that
certainly
aids
in
its
overall
impression
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
quite
a
bit
of
foamy
white
head
smells
lemony
sweet
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
from
the
store
but
if
on
sale
and
if
you
looking
for
something
to
slam
it
would
be
good
for
you
to
go
for
it
man
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
quite
a
bit
of
foamy
white
head
smells
lemony
sweet
nice
light
bodied
beer
with
a
good
clean
taste
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
drinkable
ill
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
see
it
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
get
again
the
look
of
this
beer
is
like
a
lager
yellow
the
aroma
smells
like
bananas
maybe
a
hint
of
apples
it
tastes
like
a
light
lager
there
isnt
much
of
a
honey
taste
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
it
tastes
like
there
really
isnt
any
flavor
there
this
is
how
light
lager
is
suppose
to
be
but
even
with
a
light
flavor
you
need
balance
when
the
beer
is
on
the
tounge
it
doesnt
taste
smooth
eh
poured
with
decent
white
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
aroma
is
heavy
banana
crackers
biscuit
malt
flavor
is
similar
to
aroma
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
too
the
banana
thing
is
too
much
not
a
session
beer
this
is
a
very
simple
but
well
made
beer
and
is
extremely
drinkable
and
would
likely
be
pleasant
for
most
im
a
fan
of
much
bigger
beers
and
of
extreme
beers
yet
this
one
as
simple
as
it
is
was
quite
pleasant
and
appealing
d
ill
never
have
it
again
the
horny
blonde
isnt
their
worst
beer
but
its
not
worth
having
if
for
some
reason
you
find
yourself
in
a
predicament
where
its
the
only
option
it
wont
kill
you
of
course
after
a
few
in
the
morning
you
may
wish
it
had
would
buy
again
but
probably
would
go
for
one
of
their
other
offerings
first
pours
a
pretty
golden
honey
in
color
with
about
a
halffinger
of
a
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
with
a
touch
of
honey
the
taste
is
even
more
flavorful
with
more
of
a
honey
taste
crisp
and
smooth
actually
with
a
slight
tangy
finish
no
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
brew
overall
not
bad
like
a
macro
good
lawn
mower
beer
this
is
my
first
in
a
sampler
platter
hope
it
gets
better
mouthfeel
is
overcarbonated
obviously
lightbodied
crisp
and
clean
drink
eh
only
for
the
state
tick
never
again
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
not
offensive
but
not
a
lot
to
like
either
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
o
this
is
an
okay
light
lager
it
is
certainly
better
than
most
mass
produced
light
lagers
if
it
finished
smoother
i
think
this
one
could
garner
some
more
positive
attention
than
what
has
been
seen
so
far
served
as
part
of
the
eight
beer
sampler
at
granite
city
in
st
louis
park
color
was
light
yellow
and
no
foam
by
the
time
it
arrived
no
lacing
not
sure
if
there
was
a
smell
it
was
light
and
mostly
grainy
if
it
was
anything
taste
was
crisp
mild
grain
clean
smooth
perhaps
a
step
above
a
bmc
adjunct
drinkable
enough
light
mouthfeel
and
clean
finish
okay
and
average
in
all
regards
its
advertised
as
their
mildest
offering
and
thats
exactly
right
overall
its
a
typical
hot
summer
afternoon
beer
one
that
you
would
drink
after
doing
some
yard
work
or
when
just
grilling
out
with
friends
its
not
by
any
means
great
in
fact
id
say
this
beer
is
fairly
bad
but
you
could
do
worse
not
that
youd
want
to
the
northern
lights
lager
had
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
did
not
lace
the
scent
included
hop
and
subtle
sweet
malt
the
taste
i
thought
carried
a
bit
to
it
there
was
some
sweetness
but
not
for
very
long
the
hop
really
took
over
and
left
a
sligth
aftertaste
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
light
body
failry
easy
to
drink
i
preferred
there
ipa
for
a
session
to
this
however
cooked
vegetables
in
the
flavor
red
flag
of
dms
mellow
and
buttery
buttered
corn
and
husky
grains
pretty
bland
with
enough
off
flavors
to
dump
the
last
bit
of
the
glass
not
recommended
even
for
the
dumb
label
this
is
junk
d
nothing
special
however
its
quite
enjoyable
a
good
beer
for
this
time
of
year
kicking
back
and
watching
some
football
on
the
weekends
they
go
down
easily
and
can
be
enjoyed
by
a
wide
range
of
people
finish
little
sweet
caramel
malts
clear
pale
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
quickly
settled
to
a
film
light
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
consists
of
dry
cracker
malt
and
some
grassy
hops
very
low
bitterness
which
is
not
really
surprising
the
malt
is
dry
and
gives
some
decent
flavor
for
a
light
lager
just
a
little
grassiness
from
the
hops
light
bodied
with
lower
carbonation
than
what
is
typically
found
in
this
style
not
as
prickly
and
easier
to
drink
a
nice
beer
but
at
this
price
i
would
prefer
one
of
their
other
offerings
body
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
as
it
is
supposed
to
be
drinkable
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
it
other
than
the
lack
of
flavor
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
yeast
pale
malt
grain
slight
citrus
and
slight
pale
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
light
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
grain
pale
malt
yeast
and
slight
sweet
malt
overall
a
clean
beer
but
rather
average
light
lager
drinkability
is
ok
i
can
see
kicking
back
a
few
of
these
during
a
ball
game
with
some
friends
fairly
easily
they
would
even
enjoy
it
d
this
was
a
drinkable
beer
i
think
it
drinks
more
like
a
german
pilsner
than
a
light
lager
but
hey
im
not
the
one
who
makes
up
the
signs
at
the
brewpub
nothing
great
but
its
a
good
starter
beer
for
the
night
or
an
inbetween
beer
to
help
cleanse
the
palate
overall
this
beer
is
slightly
better
than
pabst
but
nothing
special
as
with
almost
all
the
beers
ive
had
from
granite
city
food
brewery
in
kansas
city
mo
this
beer
is
hardly
carbonated
unbalanced
overall
it
was
a
good
light
beer
pours
a
clear
corn
yellow
with
a
little
to
no
head
that
bubbles
down
to
nothing
in
less
than
a
minute
tastes
a
bit
watery
and
has
hints
of
adjuct
corn
and
rice
finishes
very
clean
with
little
to
no
traces
of
what
came
before
it
was
cool
to
try
a
growler
for
the
first
time
though
i
was
feeling
pretty
thirsty
and
figured
this
was
worth
a
try
during
happy
hour
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
though
not
that
much
it
is
a
light
lager
but
it
resembles
a
nice
allmalt
lager
the
malt
profile
is
mellow
and
smooth
with
a
lightly
roasted
barley
taste
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
bold
it
aint
but
it
does
a
good
enough
job
at
having
personality
for
a
light
lager
no
medal
tallgrass
light
raccoon
river
overall
northern
light
lager
is
a
very
appropriate
moniker
for
this
brew
runofthemill
pale
lager
that
obviously
fills
the
bmc
macro
gap
for
those
that
need
it
i
didnt
i
would
not
drink
this
again
i
didnt
find
any
diference
in
this
and
your
typical
light
macro
give
it
to
a
buddy
that
will
only
touch
miller
light
the
taste
is
all
malt
and
corn
and
the
strongest
flavor
of
the
beer
there
is
a
bite
to
it
from
the
hops
that
gives
it
a
sweet
and
sour
flavor
to
it
much
sweeter
then
you
would
see
from
a
macro
light
lager
there
really
was
no
body
to
the
beer
and
was
lightly
carbonated
i
guess
this
was
the
beer
to
try
if
you
like
macros
then
why
not
just
order
a
bud

i
never
saw
this
coming

but
maybe
not

carbonated
and
drinkable
enough
granite
city
sure
let
me
down
drinkability
high
points
as
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
beer
i
can
understand
why
they
would
brew
this
they
get
one
to
have
this
and
the
bmc
drinker
likes
it
and
hopefully
will
try
one
of
the
other
beers
my
bud
light
drinking
friend
did
have
one
and
then
ordered
another
bud
light
bottle
idiot
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
with
very
little
head
or
carbonation
a
light
somewhat
sweet
taste
difficult
to
pick
out
any
hops
on
this
one
watered
down
but
then
again
there
is
light
in
the
name
probably
some
marketing
to
get
some
crossover
macro
drinkers
slightly
above
average
this
light
ale
has
a
prominent
buttery
sweet
aroma
and
flavor
with
almost
no
bitter
quality
and
a
bit
of
a
watery

but
much
less
a

staple
than
the
original

overall
well
for
a

it
is
kind
of
run
of
the

to
slightly
above
so
crisper
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
lacking
of
substantial
flavor
and
any
real

of

medium

bitterness
and
a

as

as
light

this
holds
up
nothing

nothing
wrong
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
light
not
much
retention
the
smell
was

a
little

some

yeast
in
there
too
the
taste
had
some

flavors
in
there
sweet

and
a

in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was

nicely
carbonated
and
very
easy

overall
i
was
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
as
i
havent
seen
this
one
around
much
i
feel
this
one
is
better
than
the
light
lager
opretty
good
for
a
light
beer
no
almost
no
taste
to
it
but
its
quaffable
overall
one
of
the
few
light
beers
out
there
that
has
a
light
yeast
taste
and
for
that
i
do
really
like
it
it
is
easy
on
the
palates
and
when
your
looking
for
a
a
go
to
or
a
fail
safe
this
just
might
be
it
salud
overall
light
pilsner
nothing
to
knock
yet
nothing
spectacular
very
good
casual
drinkability
o
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
once
more
we
have
an
example
of
greg
kochs
fizzy
yellow
beer
and
i
poured
it
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
glass
really
helped
with
head
retention
and
i
had
a
little
over
a
finger
of
creamy
bonewhite
head
color
was
a
pale
lemon
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
heavily
of
cereal
adjuncts
blah
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
and
the
taste
was
fairly
bland
i
was
definitely
not
impressed
finish
was
likewise
bland
watery
and
dull
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
even
less
than
amls
and
aals
both
staples
of
the
canquest
tm
and
this
was
a
pretty
light
example
ill
say
this
at
least
it
retains
a
level
of
flavor
on
par
with
the
regular
version
and
its
miles
better
than
something
like
a
bud
light
i
guess
if
you
have
to
have
a
light
beer
i
cant
think
of
a
better
one
but
its
still
a
light
beer
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
very
good
pale
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
and
taste
are
light
and
fresh
goes
down
just
like
water
pefect
for
summer
outings
or
in
the
fall
watching
football
overall
a
good
light
beer
i
would
recommend
and
will
probably
be
buying
it
again
shortly
in
the
future
my
preference
in
beers
tends
toward
the
british
isles
especially
scotch
ales
so
malt
is
what
i
crave
ive
been
forced
to
drink
crap
like
bud
light
because
thats
what
one
of
my
drinking
buddies
likes
this
is
wv
and
exposure
to
real
beers
is
at
a
minimum
but
thats
just
me
being
sociable
you
dont
have
to
force
me
to
drink
yuengling
light
for
when
i
want
lower
abv
so
i
can
spend
an
afternoon
putzing
around
on
the
deck
this
beer
more
than
adequately
fits
the
bill
regular
yuenglings
is
my
fav
american
macro
and
the
light
comes
in
neatly
behind
very
light
bodied
a
typical
mass
production
lager
amazing
light
beer
and
value
another
workmanlike
good
beer
from
yuengling
d
easy
to
drink
just
boring
and
bland
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
th
nose
brigs
some
grain
grass
and
a
bit
of
corn
taste
is
moderately
sweet
with
grass
and
grain
elements
light
feel
with
fairly
high
carbonation
his
goes
down
easy
and
does
not
have
any
real
off
flavors
it
is
simply
quite
light
this
is
nothing
that
id
pay
for
but
ive
enjoyed
worse
beer
from
many
a
brewer
in
the
past
so
id
probably
drink
this
if
someone
shoved
it
into
my
hand
overall
very
boring
lifeless
flavored
water
with
an
offputting
taste
pass
drinks
alright
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
nothing
too
nasty
either
i
could
do
1
or
2
on
a
summers
day
if
pressed
it
is
clear
cold
carbonated
and
beats
bmcs
typical
offerings
soundly
in
my
area
south
central
pa
you
can
get
the
stuff
for
about
13
a
case
on
sale
when
the
weather
turns
colder
ill
be
happy
to
turn
back
to
heavier
stuff
but
right
now
in
this
100
degree
heat
it
is
working
for
me
d
drinks
pretty
good
but
with
a
lager
as
good
as
premium
beer
available
year
round
and
not
much
higher
in
abv
id
go
for
that
every
time
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
well
nothing
taste
is
also
missing
for
the
most
part
some
gentle
notes
of
malt
and
corn
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
good
for
beer
games
overall
this
is
a
very
mediocre
light
beer
had
to
try
this
pa
beer
lager
is
a
staple
around
here
so
this
distant
cousin
should
be
ok
right
appearance
was
light
and
fizzy
somewhat
yellow
smell
was
almost
nonexistant
as
was
the
taste
then
again
its
light
mouthfeel
was
thin
as
youd
expect
drinkability
was
high
and
this
would
be
a
perfect
summer
yardwork
beverage
the
3
5
would
make
it
easy
to
drink
all
day
and
still
be
able
to
mow
or
play
volleyball
would
choose
this
over
a
mass
produced
brew
just
for
the
pa
factor
compared
to
most
light
lagers
this
one
drinks
like
a
dream
a
really
great
tasting
light
drinking
beer
its
a
lawnmower
beer
that
you
dont
have
to
think
about
its
for
hydrating
and
satisfying
the
beer
craving
appears
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
light
fizzy
white
head
forms
ample
scattered
lacing
aroma
has
a
light
cereal
note
semi
sweet
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
in
the
background
clean
tasting
flavor
from
front
to
back
with
a
wimsy
light
malt
biscuit
background
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
i
drank
a
good
bit
of
this
at
my
father
in
laws
50th
birthday
last
year
it
was
hot
outside
and
it
just
kept
going
down
so
smooth
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
carbonation
a
little
too
much
pretty
unnatural
crisp
overall
mouthfeel
no
metallic
harshness
drinkability
is
up
there
with
the
most
drinkable
brews
in
number
not
that
this
one
will
fill
your
tastebuds
with
satisfaction
as
a
starter
beer
these
would
make
great
training
wheels
this
is
an
interesting
light
beer
bout
what
you
would
expect
from
nomal
light
beers
when
it
comes
to
appearance
the
smell
was
practically
non
existant
the
taste
however
is
pretty
good
with
a
little
bitterness
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
for
sure
which
makes
for
a
average
drinkability
very
clear
yellow
in
color
plenty
of
foam
no
real
nose
other
than
a
generic
beer
smell
which
is
better
than
an
offensive
smell
i
suppose
tastes
like
it
smells
very
boring
but
safe
light
malt
flavour
watery
mouthfeel
good
amount
of
carbontion
more
drinkable
than
alot
of
macro
lights
but
far
from
great
taste
is
very
plain
and
bland
its
not
bad
and
a
bit
sweet
but
its
really
plain
and
nondescript
it
has
light
and
smooth
mouthfeel
and
its
pretty
damn
easy
to
drink
esp
with
such
a
low
abv
interested
to
try
this
after
trying
the
regular
premium
beer
pours
pale
straw
with
light
cloudiness
and
over
an
inch
of
fizzy
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
coming
up
but
hardly
any
head
retention
smells
of
corn
and
a
bit
of
plastic
not
too
bad
of
a
smell
but
sadly
lacking
all
of
the
strawgrassy
quality
of
the
regular
beer
tastes
of
corn
grains
some
plastic
though
at
least
it
does
carry
a
more
pronounced
bitterness
than
most
big
name
light
lagers
light
bodied
fizzy
but
also
nicely
prickly
on
the
mouthfeel
for
a
light
lager
this
is
okay
for
the
style
i
think
this
beer
is
a
good
representation
but
necessarily
a
good
beer
md
mouthfeel
is
light
the
beer
gets
out
of
the
way
and
falls
down
your
throat
about
what
i
would
expect
this
would
certainly
be
a
goto
for
pizza
or
a
session
when
i
had
to
drive
soon
this
is
very
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
there
is
hardly
any
flavor
at
all
pours
a
medium
yellow
minimal
head
smell
is
faintly
malty
a
tad
skunky
taste
is
light
syrupy
malt
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
it
goes
down
smoothly
to
be
expected
for
a
light
brew
probably
a
good
lawnmower
beer
definitely
a
brew
to
have
with
something
salty
average
light
beer
period
its
pretty
typical
for
this
style
cant
think
of
much
to
say
about
it
that
could
be
improved
upon
as
compared
to
miller
and
bud
light
beers
the
taste
is
a
little
thin
i
didnt
taste
much
flavor
of
any
kind
behind
it
and
it
seems
a
little
more
watery
than
other
beers
ive
tried
in
this
category
not
good
but
not
bad
either
d
went
well
with
a
big
italian
meal
i
had
a
few
of
these
and
they
hit
the
spot
low
alcohal
helps
the
drinkability
and
overall
ive
had
much
worse
d
easy
to
drink
not
so
much
i
hated
the
taste
i
think
water
has
a
lot
more
flavor
and
i
would
never
have
a
second
one
it
is
not
the
styles
fault
this
was
just
a
bad
job
while
i
am
wary
about
trying
this
again
i
wonder
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
bottle
because
i
cannot
explain
why
this
beer
gets
such
high
ratings
on
ba
d
if
you
must
drink
a
light
this
is
tastier
than
anything
from
bmc
especially
miller
lite
which
this
beer
would
be
closest
too
still
ic
light
in
aluminum
bottles
seems
like
a
bit
tastier
which
doesnt
say
much
i
love
the
y
but
ill
have
none
of
these
light
beers
it
looks
like
americas
oldest
brewery
claims
the
macro
smackdown
xxi
crown
that
doesnt
mean
that
its
great
beer
just
that
it
had
bupkis
for
competition
as
a
low
calorie
rehydrator
okay
just
dont
kid
yourself
that
youre
drinking
real
beer
glad
i
only
had
one
sample
thats
more
than
enough
even
for
a
light
beer
it
doesnt
work
very
well
overall
an
uneventful
light
lager
medium
straw
with
a
small
white
foamy
slowly
diminishing
head
some
light
lacing
smells
of
light
grain
and
cereal
with
a
light
floral
aroma
and
some
very
light
brown
sugar
tastes
of
light
grain
and
cooked
veggie
it
has
a
thin
body
lightly
slick
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
a
step
up
from
most
macro
lights
but
nothing
special
cheers
not
a
bad
light
lager
poured
out
to
a
clear
and
clean
golden
color
with
a
nice
long
lived
foamy
head
no
notes
of
lacing
aromas
of
bread
and
mild
hops
were
nice
but
a
bit
bland
something
was
missing
taste
was
middle
of
the
road
some
malt
some
grain
and
some
water
no
suprises
here
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
couldve
benefited
from
better
carbonation
drinkability
is
fair
id
go
for
regular
yuenling
first
thanks
to
maltygoodness
for
the
sample
i
am
truely
amazed
to
find
a
lighter
version
of
yuenglings
premium
with
a
little
bit
less
malt
and
not
too
bitter
the
smell
is
spring
fresh
with
no
skunk
to
ruin
your
day
and
blindfolded
i
dont
think
you
could
tell
the
difference
in
the
taste
from
the
premium
i
am
becoming
quite
a
fan
of
yuengling
as
one
might
tell
it
turns
out
that
premium
is
a
euphamism
for
macro
thats
what
this
is
yuengling
brewery
doing
a
macro
style
beer
as
opposed
to
traditional
which
is
well
traditional
thats
amber
american
lager
it
was
a
style
which
was
a
much
bigger
preprohibition
staple
in
america
anyway
the
color
is
a
sort
of
cleargold
not
nearly
as
deep
as
say
urquell
but
noticably
more
amber
than
most
macros
compared
to
the
traditional
its
lighter
and
clearer
smell
is
pretty
boring
a
little
sweet
grain
and
a
lot
of
hops
the
hops
are
kind
of
hard
to
describe
i
guess
id
call
them
metallic
or
typical
macro
if
i
found
them
objectionable
but
i
dont
theyre
pretty
bitter
but
leave
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
theyre
clean
and
surprisingly
strong
for
the
style
but
still
not
too
interesting
i
guess
the
best
way
to
describe
them
would
be
typical
macro
hops
if
typical
macro
hops
weret
disgusting
they
are
balanced
by
light
malts
that
are
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
all
about
carbonation
maybe
this
would
feel
thin
if
not
for
all
those
bubbles
but
i
honestly
cant
tell
you
i
could
taste
the
beer
fine
but
carbonation
was
all
the
mouthfeel
i
could
get
drinkability
is
fine
you
could
definately
drink
these
all
night
the
hops
dont
get
in
my
way
the
taste
isnt
bad
nothing
is
wrong
with
this
except
that
no
store
or
bar
exists
that
carries
this
unless
they
carry
the
traditional
lager
as
well
so
why
bother
this
is
obviously
what
yuengling
brewed
to
catch
the
budweiser
crowd
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
that
is
slightly
sweet
and
dry
with
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
has
a
very
light
pale
malt
flavor
with
some
adjuncts
it
is
watery
but
has
more
flavor
than
most
light
lagers
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
a
bit
musty
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
light
lager
and
quite
possibly
the
weakest
offering
from
yuengling
piured
a
clear
amber
color
with
large
puffy
white
head
there
is
littel
aroma
except
for
a
generic
beer
smell
taste
is
very
light
with
no
note
of
hops
mouth
feel
is
average
easy
to
drink
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
when
you
are
having
more
than
one
this
poured
very
light
and
was
a
pale
golden
color
small
thin
head
turned
into
a
film
after
a
sip
or
two
very
clear
the
aroma
is
very
light
and
has
a
slight
musty
graininess
theres
a
perfumey
dank
smell
that
here
the
same
that
i
get
from
other
yuengling
products
the
taste
is
light
tangy
and
has
a
clean
finish
the
body
is
light
of
course
but
is
more
sweeter
than
most
other
light
beers
for
a
light
beer
this
isnt
all
that
bad
it
has
some
of
the
same
characteristics
as
their
regular
beer
but
lighter
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
it
it
has
an
extremely
light
feeling
almost
watery
this
definatley
contributes
to
its
drinkability
it
has
a
very
clea
crisp
taste
to
it
as
well
which
definatly
helps
has
a
light
bread
like
aroma
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
hops
for
flavor
noting
really
dominat
this
is
a
watery
light
beer
whihc
makes
it
rather
drinable
and
its
only
stron
seeling
point
enjoy
yuenglings
answer
to
a
bmc
light
beer
drunk
straight
from
the
can
i
have
to
knock
a
point
for
appearance
aromas
are
of
light
breads
and
faint
old
hops
and
they
are
more
subdued
in
the
can
version
of
this
beer
than
they
are
in
the
bottled
version
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
and
is
not
very
complex
at
all
as
a
light
beer
this
is
ok
but
the
watery
mouthfeel
makes
the
drinkability
a
low
score
bought
it
for
the
wife
and
decided
to
have
one
of
the
sixpours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
decent
headthe
aroma
is
very
ironlike
with
some
grainy
notes
the
taste
is
crisp
and
very
clean
with
a
light
malty
biscuit
flavor
to
itvery
clean
beer
hey
this
is
one
of
the
better
light
bers
out
there
not
real
good
but
would
have
at
a
family
gathering
over
ab
products
any
time
a
crystalclear
lightstraw
colored
body
is
topped
by
a
decent
sized
head
of
creamy
bright
white
foam
the
retention
is
limited
and
it
drops
in
size
rather
quickly
but
surprisingly
leaves
some
nice
lace
as
it
goes
the
nose
offers
very
little
more
than
a
generic
beer
character
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
not
unlike
the
aroma
the
flavor
offers
very
little
theres
a
delicate
touch
of
malt
and
a
backing
bitterness
but
nothing
really
stands
out
it
finishes
as
short
and
dry
as
it
begins
its
not
a
bad
light
beer
in
comparison
to
many
others
however
as
its
clean
and
straightforward
without
any
odd
notes
to
it
its
simply
watered
down
yuengling
premium
and
thats
fine
but
for
the
10
or
so
calories
id
rather
have
the
extra
flavor
in
the
standard
version
poured
a
crystal
clear
bright
yellow
with
a
fairly
fizzy
white
head
that
lasted
for
an
adequate
time
on
the
surface
no
lacing
very
tough
to
pick
out
any
aroma
note
the
strange
looks
from
the
wifes
relatives
while
i
smell
my
beer
what
small
amount
of
aroma
i
could
get
was
mostly
a
raw
grainy
smell
taste
was
better
than
expected
very
clean
and
crisp
flavor
is
on
the
subdued
side
with
only
a
slightly
hoppy
bitterness
kicking
in
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
tolerable
for
a
light
beer
drinkability
is
average
too
not
a
bad
offering
from
yuengling
this
is
in
contention
with
coors
light
and
strohs
light
as
the
most
watery
beer
i
have
had
of
course
i
am
no
fan
of
light
beers
in
the
first
place
but
i
would
take
yuengling
light
lager
the
light
version
of
yuengling
traditional
lager
over
this
i
cant
recommend
yuengling
premium
light
in
the
world
of
watereddown
light
beers
this
one
stands
out
there
is
a
decent
hop
presence
to
this
beer
while
not
a
powerhouse
it
stands
up
tall
and
along
with
sam
adams
light
proves
that
a
light
can
be
decent
notice
i
said
decent
and
not
good
nice
offering
yuengling
keeps
impressing
me
pale
yellow
to
gold
color
and
very
clear
white
head
malthop
and
very
fresh
smelling
nose
fine
white
lace
in
the
glass
a
great
look
which
is
rare
in
a
light
beer
a
persistant
white
sheen
stays
on
the
surface
of
the
brew
crisp
clean
taste
with
a
sturdy
malt
base
the
hop
finish
gives
just
enough
bitterness
to
leave
your
mouth
wanting
more
this
is
a
great
domestic
light
beer
the
mouth
is
solid
and
smooth
for
a
light
beer
also
the
light
version
of
yuengling
premium
less
malt
than
it
should
have
slightly
bitter
but
highly
drinkable
smell
is
clean
and
fresh
it
is
sometimes
almost
undistinguishible
from
the
premium
this
is
also
good
on
draught
this
is
just
a
whatever
beer
that
a
casual
drinker
can
have
nothing
stands
out
with
this
one
bland
and
boring
is
this
great
beer
nope
that
is
not
the
important
question
the
real
question
is
how
does
this
compare
to
other
inexpensive
light
beers
to
that
question
i
would
say
it
is
a
superior
product
because
it
is
yuengling
it
has
a
better
color
than
the
flavor
would
suggest
has
a
pleasant
and
present
flavor
not
a
given
in
this
style
smooth
if
not
interesting
very
good
beer
if
you
want
something
really
light
and
pretty
cheap
maybe
too
much
for
lawn
mower
beer
but
perfect
for
a
summer
cookout
with
the
boys
that
goes
all
day
and
night
solid
light
beer
as
far
as
low
calorietaste
goes
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
ok
for
a
light
macro
lager
much
better
than
the
bmc
versions
not
as
good
as
the
regular
lager
it
is
a
little
more
bland
however
still
very
smooth
its
a
tasty
beer
im
trying
to
cut
calories
wish
the
abv
was
a
little
higher
overall
a
pleasant
light
lager
grabbed
a
couple
of
these
walking
around
and
enjoyed
the
taste
and
smell
mouth
feel
was
good
i
could
session
a
lot
of
these
not
going
to
get
drunk
on
this
much
better
than
st
louis
swill
or
rocky
mountain
low
a
great
american
light
beer
above
average
for
a
light
beer
overall
yuengling
light
is
probably
the
best
light
beer
youll
find
and
has
somewhat
more
flavor
than
the
budmillercoors
lights
yet
it
retains
the
same
price
point
im
not
a
light
beer
drinker
but
if
i
had
to
pick
one
i
would
choose
this
the
best
light
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
so
far
love
it
solid
and
tasty
definitely
a
light
beer
also
definitely
a
quality
one
in
the
bottle
this
was
ok
for
a
light
beer
id
have
to
say
as
far
as
widely
available
light
lagers
go
this
is
the
best
option
although
its
a
bit
low
on
the
abv
compared
to
others
in
the
class
with
this
beer
the
consumer
will
sacrifice
about
8
abv
for
100
better
taste
as
with
yuenglings
lager
this
doesnt
possess
the
adjunct
flavors
associated
with
american
lagers
it
has
a
nice
barley
graininess
slight
caramel
malt
but
an
off
putting
metallic
watery
quality
it
also
holds
a
rather
harsh
sharpness
in
flavor
and
taste
with
a
sour
after
taste
fan
of
the
standard
but
this
is
not
worth
the
dip
in
taste
to
save
some
calories
pours
a
light
yellow
with
almost
no
head
the
smell
is
very
light
with
only
some
rice
scents
coming
through
the
taste
is
underwhelming
with
some
rice
from
the
malt
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
its
not
complex
but
it
is
a
decent
light
beer
for
the
price
hard
to
find
much
to
say
about
it
its
a
light
brew
with
a
light
flavor
does
what
it
says
on
the
tin
i
suppose
for
a
light
beer
this
is
good
it
is
slightly
watery
but
it
is
a
light
nice
session
abv
easy
to
knock
down
a
six
pack
and
not
feel
to
guilty
about
it
worth
a
try
on
a
hot
day
o
slightly
better
than
the
mass
produced
light
beers
from
the
big
breweries
in
the
usa
but
not
by
all
that
much
not
something
i
would
get
with
any
amount
of
regularity
best
light
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
its
not
what
i
would
call
a
good
beer
exactly
but
as
inexpensive
light
beers
go
its
perfectly
acceptable
do
not
believe
the
commercials
this
tastes
nothing
like
the
commercials
say
this
is
a
slight
metalic
taste
and
it
does
not
come
close
to
the
traditional
really
disappointed
by
this
and
at
3
2
why
even
bother
best
in
the
readily
available
light
category
better
than
most
for
this
category
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
fuller
bodied
than
most
light
beers
not
my
favorite
but
inexpensive
and
perfectly
competent
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
anyone
on
a
diet
the
appearance
is
a
pleasing
light
amber
the
head
when
poured
frothy
but
not
very
long
lasting
the
taste
is
pleasing
but
not
as
robust
as
the
regular
lager
but
that
is
to
be
expected
the
smell
is
not
strong
overall
i
think
this
is
better
than
any
of
the
light
beers
that
i
have
tried
yuengling
light
is
a
step
up
from
natty
light
and
i
happen
to
love
to
swill
that
beer
when
more
than
one
is
needed
yl
has
a
good
color
and
its
has
a
fairly
strong
aroma
for
a
light
brew
its
taste
is
mild
and
does
not
leave
an
aftertaste
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
the
lovers
of
heavier
beers
should
steer
clear
of
but
for
those
mere
mortals
who
love
a
cold
one
while
mowing
the
yard
will
simply
enjoy
the
mild
but
refreshing
flavor
o
in
a
blind
tasting
one
might
mistake
this
for
their
flagship
lager
a
few
sips
in
a
dedicated
fan
may
begin
to
notice
something
off
a
notso
surprisingly
great
light
beer
overall
for
the
style
this
is
surprisingly
awesome
and
would
be
one
that
i
would
turn
to
if
i
wanted
a
light
beer
plenty
of
flavor
unlike
a
lot
of
the
beers
in
this
style
which
seem
to
be
either
sugared
up
andor
watered
down
i
think
i
like
this
better
than
regular
yuengling
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
it
being
criticizing
the
light
lager
category
is
easier
than
shooting
fish
in
a
barrel
its
more
like
insulting
fish
in
a
barrel
for
what
it
is
yuengling
light
lager
is
decidedly
above
average
the
hints
of
amber
keep
things
interesting
id
place
this
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
cheap
light
lagers
alongside
narragansett
light
yuengling
light
lager
brewed
by
yuengling
the
brew
pours
out
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
this
brew
is
light
it
has
an
abv
of
3
2
the
smell
is
rich
with
flavor
there
is
nothing
bad
about
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
light
and
crips
not
much
to
this
brew
as
far
as
taste
there
is
some
flovor
at
first
but
it
goes
away
fast
the
after
taste
is
like
water
i
was
hoping
for
more
this
brew
but
it
is
not
there
yuengling
light
lager
is
a
good
drinking
brew
nothing
bad
at
all
i
just
thought
there
would
be
more
flavor
but
i
guess
it
is
smooth
because
of
its
low
abv
i
would
get
this
brew
again
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
color
lager
with
small
bubbly
white
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
sweet
notes
with
light
cereal
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
cereal
notes
with
almost
no
aftertaste
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
lager
with
very
little
complexity
very
clean
but
very
bland
i
have
to
give
it
some
credit
for
not
having
putrid
offflavors
some
of
its
counterparts
have
drink
ice
cold
and
you
will
not
notice
the
off
flavors
i
am
disappointed
with
this
beer
because
i
love
the
regular
lager
that
they
make
this
was
far
worse
than
the
regular
lager
i
like
the
look
and
color
a
lot
there
was
no
head
but
it
was
a
beautiful
colored
beer
other
than
the
look
the
beer
stunk
the
task
is
very
bitter
i
rather
drink
a
milwaukees
best
ice
to
be
honest
the
feeling
was
even
worse
than
the
taste
the
beer
finished
leaving
your
mouth
very
dry
and
bitter
feeling
i
had
bout
a
case
of
this
thinking
it
would
be
great
like
the
regular
lager
but
with
less
calories
i
was
very
wrong
and
it
was
a
total
waste
of
money
its
got
a
nice
color
that
leans
toward
amber
as
oppose
to
most
american
beers
that
are
just
a
light
yellow
and
the
most
important
thing
is
it
taste
good
its
funny
because
the
yuengling
lager
taste
bad
i
dont
like
it
one
bit
but
this
i
recomend
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
it
has
a
light
dryness
toward
the
end
of
it
but
is
generally
refreshing
its
nothing
more
than
one
would
expect
of
a
cheap
light
lager
flavor
is
better
than
it
could
be
between
this
and
other
light
beers
i
suppose
i
would
still
pick
this
over
bud
miller
coors
etc
but
one
point
of
disappointment
that
i
need
to
raise
is
the
exceptionally
low
alcohol
content
with
an
abv
of
only
3
2
its
a
failure
seems
like
the
brewerys
idea
for
yeungling
light
is
to
water
down
the
regular
beer
while
still
charging
the
same
price
for
traditional
pager
im
not
going
to
get
skinny
drinking
this
im
just
going
to
have
to
pay
for
more
drinks
to
get
a
buzz
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
caramel
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
and
not
much
head
at
all
a
bit
on
the
pale
side
to
look
at
aromas
of
caramel
sweet
toasted
grains
and
not
much
else
slightly
watery
nose
flavors
are
buttery
and
caramel
forward
but
again
watered
down
with
a
very
subtle
toastiness
in
the
backbone
light
bodied
with
a
slight
crisp
in
the
finish
from
the
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
toasted
and
slightly
sweet
this
is
certainly
an
easy
drinker
but
lacks
a
bit
in
every
other
department
i
guess
what
i
am
saying
is
in
light
beer
land
yuengling
light
is
god
o
this
beer
seems
like
it
is
a
slight
cut
above
the
most
common
light
lagers
but
isnt
anything
special
overall
on
the
plus
side
it
looks
rather
nice
for
a
light
beer
but
other
than
that
well
this
beer
is
inoffensive
unlike
most
light
beers
however
i
never
really
have
the
desire
to
take
another
sip
it
isnt
much
better
than
most
light
beers
taste
wise
it
has
a
nice
body
and
nice
smell
i
just
cant
recommend
this
beer
as
much
as
i
love
the
yuengling
family
drink
a
regular
yuengling
they
arent
super
high
on
calories
not
remediable
because
well
it
is
not
especially
good
and
not
especially
bad
very
light
even
for
a
logger
it
is
not
quite
bud
light
thin
but
still
very
thin
and
for
the
abv
well
i
guess
its
good
if
your
trying
to
take
it
easy
but
for
the
money
your
better
off
drinking
cheaper
light
beers
rjt
actually
a
bit
better
in
my
opinion
than
their
regular
lager
this
light
lager
has
more
flavor
than
most
light
beers
but
offers
nothing
particularly
special
it
has
flavors
of
bread
grain
malt
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
and
it
is
somewhat
more
bitter
than
most
run
of
the
mill
light
beers
where
i
live
this
sells
for
5
996
pack
bottles
and
is
actually
a
bit
less
than
coors
light
and
some
other
light
beers
while
not
particularly
good
this
light
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
a
somewhat
better
choice
than
other
cheap
beer
options
also
with
its
low
abv
it
makes
for
a
decent
session
beer
for
someone
with
a
low
budget
i
had
no
choice
but
to
try
this
light
beer
at
the
last
party
i
was
at
who
the
heck
only
stocks
light
beer
in
the
cooler
anyway
it
wasnt
half
bad
the
beer
had
a
great
golden
look
with
a
white
frothy
head
what
surprised
me
was
the
bold
crisp
flavor
the
beer
had
even
though
it
felt
a
bit
watery
overall
it
was
one
of
the
better
lights
i
have
had
this
is
definitely
not
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
for
a
light
it
is
not
bad
at
all
serves
its
purpose
and
i
would
drink
again
its
alright
i
guess
ill
drink
it
from
timetotime
you
dont
have
to
im
pretty
sure
that
all
they
did
was
water
down
regular
yuengling
lager
until
it
was
below
100
carbs
99
according
to
the
bottle
and
then
bottle
it
as
a
light
beer
really
glad
this
beer
was
given
to
me
because
i
wouldnt
buy
it
if
you
are
a
fan
of
traditional
yuengling
lager
then
go
with
that
and
if
you
are
trying
to
watch
you
calories
drink
less
or
make
cuts
somewhere
else
o
basically
a
watered
down
traditional
yuengling
without
that
sour
lingering
aftertaste
still
would
take
the
full
flavored
version
over
this
one
though
take
all
the
bad
features
of
the
normal
yuengling
its
gross
stale
malt
flavor
its
way
over
the
top
carbonation
and
its
skunky
aftertaste
then
water
it
all
down
and
this
is
what
you
get
it
pours
clear
and
bubbly
minimal
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
bad
metallc
and
off
on
the
malt
no
hops
at
all
the
flavor
is
just
a
dumbed
down
regular
yuengling
with
a
little
less
body
carbonation
is
also
brutally
ovedone
feels
like
a
pepsi
in
my
mouth
but
tastes
far
worse
this
had
me
on
the
verge
of
throwing
up
in
my
mouth
no
joke
i
can
find
some
redeeming
factor
in
any
beer
which
is
hard
in
this
case
but
guess
if
you
want
to
drink
all
day
and
not
catch
a
buzz
this
it
your
go
not
something
ill
hopefully
ever
drink
again
o
it
looks
great
for
a
light
beer
thats
about
it
its
as
close
to
water
as
ive
come
across
since
having
a
coors
light
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
yuengling
is
always
pretty
solid
and
this
one
might
edge
out
the
original
in
the
summer
1
5
d
weak
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
in
its
style
nicely
drinkable
great
with
food
but
overall
theres
not
much
going
on
here
decent
overall
its
fairly
inoffensive
but
it
sure
smelled
unappealing
on
first
open
i
suppose
you
could
do
worse
cant
say
i
am
really
drawn
to
this
though
whats
the
point
of
drinking
a
beer
that
has
next
to
nothing
for
taste
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
the
head
didnt
stay
around
for
too
long
and
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
corn
not
much
to
this
brew
at
all
its
not
a
bad
aroma
but
not
great
either
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
its
all
sweet
malt
and
corn
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
smooth
a
bit
slick
and
goes
down
easy
enough
id
have
to
say
for
the
style
of
beer
this
is
its
average
ive
certainly
had
a
lot
worse
its
not
offensive
at
all
and
for
the
most
part
i
think
its
more
enjoyable
than
most
light
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
not
that
i
would
make
a
point
to
seek
this
out
but
its
really
not
bad
single
bought
from
blacklick
wine
and
spirits
for
1
09
well
i
cant
say
i
totally
hated
this
thing
but
there
wasnt
much
to
hate
it
was
drinkable
like
water
or
coke
o
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
light
lager
i
like
it
better
than
the
offerings
from
the
big
three
but
it
still
is
not
something
i
will
be
stocking
in
the
fridge
any
time
soon
served
from
bottle
into
a
shaker
poured
a
golden
caramel
color
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutty
and
floral
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
nutty
floral
and
water
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
average
brew
while
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
it
really
wasnt
bad
either
just
wish
this
one
would
have
been
a
little
more
complex
would
make
a
good
gateway
beer
for
the
regular
frat
boy
out
there
i
tried
the
yuengling
light
lager
during
a
visit
to
ohio
the
beer
poured
a
light
oak
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
headthen
lay
to
a
light
lace
around
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
and
taste
were
mostly
malt
with
slight
balance
hop
the
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
carbonated
overall
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
a
nice
light
beer
overall
a
good
light
beer
o
decent
for
the
style
does
the
trick
what
yuengling
was
trying
to
do
probably
only
have
again
if
im
trying
to
lose
weight
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
light
lager
easily
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
thus
far
prefer
the
normal
yuengling
lager
this
light
beer
had
no
taste
really
i
dont
like
any
light
beers
but
i
would
prefer
one
of
the
big
3
over
this
one
the
aroma
was
alright
the
appearance
was
a
light
bright
color
but
the
taste
wasnt
that
good
didnt
apprecaite
the
aftertaste
either
i
believe
i
can
get
the
same
quality
of
this
beer
at
a
lower
price
as
well
o
this
was
my
second
or
third
time
having
it
maybe
its
because
i
was
paying
more
attention
this
time
around
but
pretty
disappointed
and
a
lot
less
flavor
than
i
remembered
even
if
i
had
a
long
night
of
drinking
ahead
of
me
i
would
go
with
yuengling
heavy
over
this
o
not
bad
after
mowing
the
lawn
thats
for
true
i
could
see
this
being
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
but
definitely
not
one
id
keep
on
hand
if
available
there
is
much
more
flavor
here
than
is
present
in
other
light
beers
and
i
would
gladly
choose
this
over
any
bmc
light
lager
poured
mid
pale
yellow
body
with
a
white
head
that
starts
full
but
dies
off
quickly
spotting
more
than
lacing
the
glass
aroma
is
weedy
grass
rice
corn
taste
is
a
bit
acrid
but
crisp
a
touch
thin
and
watery
leaves
a
slick
almost
oily
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
out
of
a
24oz
can
this
beer
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
decent
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma
was
of
pale
malt
lager
yeast
and
almost
no
hops
the
flavors
were
also
almost
all
pale
malt
some
adjuncts
corn
cereal
grains
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
very
easy
to
drink
but
also
very
little
to
write
about
the
body
was
light
the
carbonation
average
and
the
mouthfeel
ok
pours
a
lite
goldenamber
deep
color
for
a
beer
of
this
style
a
white
head
soon
rings
low
carbonation
and
as
a
result
the
feel
suffers
smell
is
mild
adjunct
and
not
much
else
taste
is
very
light
biscuit
small
amounts
of
bitters
and
water
mostly
water
pours
with
a
tall
head
that
quickly
disappears
while
i
love
yuengling
light
just
does
not
work
it
is
your
typical
watered
down
light
beer
it
is
only
god
for
the
hottest
day
when
mowing
the
lawn
ive
got
a
case
in
the
basement
so
i
hope
it
gets
warm
so
i
can
finish
it
quaffable
mild
flavor
moderate
carbonation
not
all
that
bad
for
the
style
d
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
but
i
doubt
ill
revisit
otherwise
probably
the
best
readily
available
light
beer
extremely
high
drinkability
my
friend
brought
a
six
pack
over
the
other
night
and
i
had
a
couple
the
color
was
a
light
amber
taste
was
smooth
however
it
seemed
more
watered
down
overall
taste
was
ok
and
this
would
be
a
great
summer
time
beer
outside
in
the
heat
overall
the
beer
was
ok
but
i
prefer
the
origial
yuengling
traditional
lager
o
not
too
bad
at
just
3
4
probably
one
of
the
better
light
lagers
out
there
unfortunately
theres
just
not
much
character
with
this
beer
and
it
becomes
more
unenjoyable
throughout
consumption
o
not
bad
for
an
american
light
lager
and
worked
ok
as
a
beverage
to
accompany
a
meal
just
ok
with
a
no
frills
design
teacolored
beer
with
a
light
head
that
dissipates
quickly
grassy
sweet
aroma
with
light
citrus
notes
crisp
fresh
leafy
flavor
creamy
texture
but
doesnt
feel
heavy
at
all
the
only
way
i
can
tell
this
is
a
light
beer
is
the
slightly
watery
body
but
even
that
isnt
unpleasant
hard
to
believe
this
is
in
the
same
category
as
the
bmc
lights
id
drink
this
stuff
all
the
time
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
o
in
the
land
of
american
light
lagers
this
would
be
near
the
top
there
arent
any
real
off
flavors
like
some
of
the
other
mass
produced
beers
have
nice
and
light
tasting
its
a
light
beer
and
refreshing
in
the
summer
honestly
i
wish
theyd
stop
making
light
beers
this
beer
pours
just
like
its
fuller
version
the
traditional
lager
its
got
a
copperish
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
goes
away
quickly
the
smells
are
almost
the
same
its
kind
of
hoppy
and
its
got
some
grains
in
there
too
the
aroma
is
super
light
though
the
taste
is
virtually
absent
from
this
beer
compared
to
the
original
lager
this
beer
is
very
weak
on
flavor
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
should
just
drink
the
real
thing
ill
begin
with
stating
my
fondness
for
yuengling
lager
its
been
one
of
my
standby
beers
for
a
long
time
after
a
recent
band
practice
at
my
home
i
found
a
couple
bottle
of
the
light
lager
left
by
my
sax
player
so
watching
the
game
the
other
nightpop
first
sip
out
of
the
bottle
was
a
shockwatery
really
watery
so
i
poured
the
brew
into
a
pint
glass
hey
looks
like
lagernice
color
drank
it
down
and
this
is
my
view
on
this
beer
take
a
reg
lageradd
14
cup
of
waterlight
lager
i
wasnt
fond
of
this
beer
watery
taste
watery
mouthfeel
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
want
to
drink
again
stick
to
the
real
deal
lager
o
better
than
your
average
watery
light
beer
in
some
ways
in
others
about
well
average
have
had
a
few
different
yuenglings
in
the
last
couple
years
but
never
this
one
as
a
version
of
their
standards
that
satisfies
the
calorieconscious
99
calories
says
so
on
the
label
id
say
it
isnt
bad
at
all
among
the
best
ive
tried
of
the
style
notes
overall
its
an
average
light
beer
with
no
real
flaws
for
its
style
its
light
on
everything
and
easy
to
drink
yuengling
light
lager
pours
out
a
slighter
shade
than
your
average
yuengling
traditional
this
is
a
tan
shade
of
amber
a
nice
inch
of
ecru
foam
on
top
fades
becomes
a
cap
leaving
sqiggles
smell
is
fairly
simple
wait
im
being
to
nice
this
actually
smells
like
hay
and
faded
barley
with
a
hint
of
corn
taste
is
a
step
up
though
if
you
had
a
yuengling
this
is
the
same
just
toned
down
a
notch
or
they
put
less
corn
in
it
or
something
feel
is
light
like
the
name
implies
and
the
carb
is
crisp
out
of
da
can
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
but
a
good
one
to
go
for
if
your
in
a
pinch
or
if
your
extremely
broke
at
the
time
hence
why
i
purchased
this
it
was
only
average
drinkability
even
being
only
99
calories
it
still
felt
heavier
than
a
light
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
not
something
i
could
tailgate
with
its
more
of
a
have
a
few
gotta
drive
home
later
type
beer
made
me
feel
fuller
than
normal
light
beers
overall
a
good
beer
that
should
be
picked
up
thanks
to
woody
for
the
can
wow
a
light
beer
with
some
color
its
nice
to
see
a
light
beer
that
is
something
other
than
the
usual
pale
yellow
amber
caramel
bronze
colored
with
no
head
just
a
tight
ring
of
lace
on
the
top
of
the
glass
faint
hint
of
caramel
in
the
nose
but
theres
really
not
much
there
at
least
it
doesnt
smell
bad
faint
malt
caramel
and
lemon
grass
flavors
its
a
light
beer
so
its
light
on
flavor
but
at
least
its
a
light
beer
with
flavor
very
light
in
body
with
a
nice
dry
finish
for
a
light
lager
you
could
do
much
worse
this
and
sam
adams
are
the
2
best
light
beers
ive
had
d
better
than
the
average
light
beer
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
maybe
halfway
between
the
usual
light
beer
and
yuengling
small
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
and
a
thin
film
left
on
top
has
a
bit
of
the
smell
of
yuengling
regular
a
quite
noticeable
sweetness
taste
is
where
things
go
wrong
too
much
carbonation
up
front
like
seltzer
water
behind
it
there
is
not
much
taste
just
a
watereddown
version
of
the
normal
beer
the
flavor
is
pushed
to
the
background
ill
admit
that
this
is
different
than
the
bmc
lights
it
doesnt
have
the
skunky
and
metallic
flavors
but
that
doesnt
make
it
better
as
is
virtually
always
the
case
with
light
beer
this
tastes
very
much
like
the
full
calorie
version
with
extra
water
since
the
full
calorie
version
is
a
very
good
though
admittedly
somewhat
simple
beer
and
theres
no
such
thing
as
a
light
bock
or
ipa
or
even
a
light
hefe
weisse
at
least
not
that
i
know
of
this
is
naturally
one
of
the
best
light
beers
ive
ever
had
ok
really
the
best
there
are
years
between
my
rating
this
and
the
former
champ
amstel
so
im
not
sure
if
my
number
rating
will
reflect
that
anyway
its
like
yuengling
traditional
only
lighter
and
waterier
color
is
still
brown
though
paler
than
the
traditional
head
is
basically
nonexistent
smell
is
slightly
malty
just
barely
detectable
hops
and
generally
cleaner
than
the
traditional
since
it
comes
in
a
brown
bottle
instead
of
a
green
one
the
taste
still
demonstrates
a
recognizable
malt
character
its
actually
maltier
than
many
a
full
calorie
macro
like
miller
the
hops
are
the
same
tasty
combo
of
cascade
and
cluster
found
in
traditional
thanks
for
clearing
that
up
alstrom
bros
though
obviously
weaker
mouthfeel
is
slightly
on
the
watery
side
though
compared
to
other
light
beers
its
unusually
substantial
drinkablity
is
as
good
as
possible
for
anything
that
contains
alcohol
the
taste
may
not
produce
a
symphony
in
your
mouth
but
its
clean
pleasant
and
very
substantial
for
a
light
combined
with
its
light
easy
drinking
nature
you
definitely
have
something
you
could
drink
all
day
this
gets
an
a
for
light
beer
maybe
an
a
for
a
cheap
american
brew
you
can
buy
anywhere
if
you
live
on
the
east
coast
like
me
maybe
a
b
when
rated
among
all
beers
yes
ive
got
a
sentimental
bias
in
favor
of
yuengling
products
but
this
is
still
exceptional
for
a
light
beer
mouthfeel
is
onpar
for
the
style
and
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
beer
altogether
only
3
4
nice
so
does
that
mean
that
yuengling
light
lager
qualifies
as
a
session
beer
inquiring
minds
want
to
know
part
of
a
yuengling
sampler
pack
being
a
light
beer
definitely
not
my
preferred
style
of
beer
but
im
open
to
try
anything
pours
a
dark
golden
color
thin
head
looks
pretty
good
for
a
light
beer
no
aroma
to
this
one
very
light
bodied
slight
lacing
on
glass
watery
mouthfeel
to
say
the
least
but
theres
a
slight
hoppiness
in
there
and
definitely
has
at
least
some
taste
extremely
drinkable
and
goes
down
easily
especially
with
the
lower
abv
as
a
beer
overall
this
wouldnt
rank
very
high
but
in
the
light
beer
spectrum
this
one
is
pretty
good
lookstastes
better
than
a
ton
of
other
light
beers
except
sam
adams
light
of
course
and
goes
down
easy
nice
easy
beer
to
drink
just
take
it
for
what
it
is
d
for
a
light
lager
it
is
easy
to
drink
low
alcohol
content
has
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
drinking
them
while
tailgating
drinkability
my
ratings
seem
higher
than
i
expected
but
a
part
of
that
is
probably
an
indication
of
the
category
overall
this
is
more
impressive
than
most
of
the
standard
light
beers
you
will
find
i
mentioned
that
i
bought
a
12pack
after
a
party
to
finish
out
the
night
and
it
seems
it
would
serve
that
type
of
purpose
if
you
can
drink
water
you
can
drink
this
this
beer
was
made
for
drinkability
as
well
as
a
slightly
healtier
alternative
as
far
as
light
lagers
go
this
is
prolly
the
best
ive
seen
so
far
not
so
much
of
an
adjunct
flavor
but
still
hella
watery
dperfect
im
not
sure
if
theres
another
beer
i
could
have
a
larger
volume
of
of
course
this
has
to
do
with
the
low
abv
but
the
taste
is
quite
yummy
considering
the
verdict
very
low
abv
and
lack
of
offensiveness
would
make
it
a
good
session
beer
its
better
still
than
macros
however
if
youre
looking
for
any
complexity
you
should
stay
away
then
again
the
word
light
probably
tells
you
that
already
this
beer
had
more
body
and
flavour
to
it
than
many
other
light
lagers
i
have
remembered
tasting
its
a
good
choice
for
cutting
the
grass
i
can
definately
see
myself
drinking
this
when
im
in
the
mood
shits
not
bad
a
little
more
complex
than
most
light
beers
and
easy
on
the
wallet
you
want
a
decent
beer
with
which
to
sit
on
your
porch
and
play
the
guitar
this
one
is
a
model
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
by
marco
lager
standards
not
awful
but
certainly
one
of
the
last
choices
at
least
if
there
are
other
options
granted
the
few
beers
ive
had
that
i
really
hate
and
wont
drink
again
still
would
be
worse
than
this
one
but
thats
just
an
opinion
drinkability
what
you
would
expect
from
a
light
lager
could
be
easily
written
off
as
a
watereddown
version
of
the
traditional
but
viewed
as
a
pilsner
it
is
above
average
and
something
that
can
be
readily
enjoyed
the
beer
poured
a
light
oak
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
headthen
lay
to
a
light
lace
around
the
top
of
the
glass
it
has
a
decent
taste
a
little
watery
and
carbonated
nice
mouth
feel
goes
down
smooth
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
a
nice
light
beer
better
than
most
light
beers
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
full
cap
of
frothy
white
head
diminishing
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
scent
is
clean
with
only
a
hint
of
dried
hay
and
must
as
regular
yuengling
lager
is
a
tad
more
fuller
taste
than
many
other
macros
the
light
version
brings
it
in
check
with
most
american
macro
lagers
dried
hay
touch
of
nuttyness
and
some
must
are
the
only
notable
flavors
highly
carbonated
slightly
watery
a
decent
replacement
for
the
bmc
lights
of
the
world
d
very
sessionable
and
a
step
above
macros
still
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
though
drinkability
it
is
a
light
beer
fairly
refreshing
decent
at
best
great
crisp
refreshing
mouth
on
this
some
light
toasted
grains
in
the
flavor
bitterness
is
low
which
is
expected
finish
is
sweet
i
cant
say
that
theres
a
ton
more
complexity
that
a
bmc
light
but
its
just
bettercrafted
this
ones
got
a
bit
of
flavor
and
a
much
thicker
mouthfeel
drinkable
you
better
freaking
believe
it
notes
still
plenty
of
carbonation
gives
this
a
decent
mouthfeel
however
there
is
no
way
to
look
at
it
but
this
is
a
real
shortcoming
for
yuengling
d
the
drinkability
is
good
here
its
very
light
and
refreshing
this
is
a
chuggable
light
lager
for
sure
notes
i
love
traditional
lager
but
i
just
cant
stomach
whatever
it
is
they
do
to
make
this
flavor
just
bad
in
my
humble
opinion
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
light
with
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
ok
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
for
me
to
want
to
drink
more
overall
one
of
the
better
light
beers
but
thats
probably
not
saying
much
taste
is
like
a
bmc
light
lager
not
much
here
light
hoppines
bur
really
light
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
like
most
bmc
lagers
skip
this
go
for
the
light
beer
overall
one
of
the
most
appealing
light
lagers
i
have
had
hats
off
for
this
one
i
think
it
is
better
than
the
traditional
lager
very
drinkable
though
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
due
to
the
raving
of
my
northern
friends
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
eggshell
head
over
the
clear
amber
brew
head
lasts
pretty
well
with
average
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
minimal
pale
sweetness
and
slightly
earthy
hops
taste
is
sedate
light
pale
malts
and
balancing
crisp
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
easy
good
option
for
the
style
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
amber
highlights
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
of
malts
not
as
watered
down
as
other
light
beers
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
for
a
light
beer
this
aint
that
bad
like
others
it
came
in
a
sampler
i
had
to
try
1
before
i
gave
the
rest
away
ehhh
its
in
the
name
light
better
tasting
than
your
run
of
the
mill
domestics
didnt
waste
time
with
a
glass
just
swigged
it
from
the
bottle
initial
taste
was
smooth
and
faded
quickly
actually
had
a
german
taste
for
the
finish
dont
have
much
to
say
for
light
beers
period
for
a
light
beer
its
not
as
bad
as
the
macros
but
its
still
a
light
beer
got
a
sixer
that
came
with
the
variety
otherwise
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
d
definitly
drinkable
just
dont
know
how
much
i
want
to
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
date
or
lot
code
sampled
on
october
12
2009
the
pour
is
a
handsome
ambercopper
with
little
to
no
head
slow
upwardly
mobile
carbonation
bubbles
and
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
has
a
dab
of
sweeter
malts
and
neutral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
study
for
a
light
beer
the
flavor
is
a
mixture
of
caramel
malts
and
rather
bready
a
nice
enough
light
lager
a
decent
beer
and
well
above
average
for
this
style
this
still
resembles
a
nice
lager
whereas
many
larger
breweries
do
not
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
in
the
glass
it
has
a
solid
gold
color
definitely
darker
than
most
of
its
peers
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
more
faintly
of
floralspicy
hops
it
has
a
nice
balanced
hops
and
light
malt
flavor
as
it
hits
the
palate
but
that
flavor
disappears
almost
as
soon
as
it
arrived
mouthfeel
is
lacking
as
was
expected
all
in
all
this
one
is
a
step
above
the
macro
light
brews
this
beer
is
not
terrible
for
what
it
is
its
really
easy
drinking
and
is
not
offensive
in
anyone
aspect
its
definitely
a
way
watered
down
version
of
there
regular
lager
but
its
still
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
light
beer
basically
this
is
a
good
option
if
you
are
looking
for
a
long
session
beer
its
strong
point
is
obviously
its
drinkability
and
its
low
point
is
you
cant
definitely
at
times
feel
its
very
watered
down
i
got
two
fingers
of
ecru
head
off
of
my
pour
which
held
in
nicely
color
was
the
same
mediumreddish
amber
as
its
leaded
counterpart
which
made
my
hopes
rise
nose
had
a
light
malty
sweetness
again
not
too
different
from
the
leaded
version
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
the
taste
was
really
thin
dang
it
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
recommend
a
lowcalorie
lowcarb
counterpart
but
this
just
did
not
have
the
ooomph
to
cause
me
to
do
so
there
was
a
light
sweetness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
pleasant
which
a
lot
of
light
beers
cannot
say
and
even
a
little
dry
but
overall
it
was
a
lesser
experience
tood
bad
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
beer
this
might
be
a
good
candidate
but
otherwise
id
say
have
a
traditional
lager
the
leaded
version
malty
a
little
sweet
but
definitely
husky
on
the
palate
finishes
with
the
lightest
touch
of
bitterness
not
much
happening
here
i
probably
will
not
go
back
to
this
one
it
is
not
an
imperial
stout
or
a
scottish
ale
but
it
works
after
the
grass
is
cut
sam
adams
is
a
better
light
but
it
also
has
much
more
calories
i
believe
that
yuengling
lager
is
one
of
the
best
macros
out
there
so
i
figured
yuengling
light
wouldnt
be
too
bad
either
well
this
beer
is
extremely
light
on
smell
taste
and
body
its
an
extremely
watered
down
version
of
their
lager
with
hardly
anything
exciting
about
it
it
has
hardly
any
aroma
tastes
like
tap
water
with
malt
in
it
and
had
an
extremely
thin
body
nothing
too
exciting
about
this
beer
but
i
guess
if
you
are
one
of
those
anal
caloriecarb
counters
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
d
i
rate
the
drinkability
of
this
pretty
high
you
could
have
quite
a
session
with
these
with
them
close
to
3
abv
just
a
foul
tasting
brew
i
was
hoping
this
might
be
a
light
lager
i
enjoy
but
alas
twas
not
to
be
thin
watery
rancid
avoid
d
if
you
like
water
youll
be
able
to
drink
this
very
thin
its
average
rather
than
terrible
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
most
beers
in
this
style
are
light
versions
of
adjunct
lagers
however
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
is
a
lighter
version
of
a
vienna
lager
the
result
is
more
flavor
than
most
others
low
abv
light
taste
and
a
decent
flavor
all
in
all
for
a
lowcal
version
its
a
pretty
close
approximation
of
yuenglings
traditional
lager
mouthfeeldrinkability
tiny
bubbles
prickle
in
the
mouth
never
becoming
more
than
just
a
mellow
texture
overall
two
ways
to
score
drinkability
do
i
want
another
because
the
experience
was
so
pleasurable
hell
no
would
i
select
this
beer
to
pound
by
the
carload
in
sweltering
100
degree
heat
probably
my
number
one
choice
very
light
amber
clear
golden
color
with
steady
carbonation
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
nice
for
the
style
light
grain
smell
with
a
little
caramel
medium
body
with
sharp
carbonation
strong
grain
flavor
light
malt
background
and
some
hops
bite
in
the
finish
with
the
carbonation
balancing
out
initial
sweetness
this
beer
is
what
it
is
an
above
average
macroish
light
lager
d
ill
take
the
caloric
hit
and
take
the
regular
yuengling
at
least
its
palatable
also
i
will
try
and
review
the
can
version
of
this
can
versions
are
simply
not
the
same
beer
never
has
been
for
me
dr
i
like
water
better
i
finished
it
because
im
cheap
and
wont
waste
it
drinkability
a
very
easy
to
consume
beer
but
with
such
a
low
abv
ya
got
to
be
able
to
drink
alot
to
get
a
good
drunk
on
but
its
still
a
way
better
light
beer
than
ml
bl
or
cl
d
ok
this
is
my
first
light
lager
ive
reviewed
and
it
is
as
i
had
expected
very
light
in
all
respects
you
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
not
complex
just
simple
beer
low
carbs
and
low
abv
that
being
said
i
would
run
away
from
this
beer
ill
start
working
in
some
light
beers
and
come
back
to
this
one
to
compare
i
mean
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
this
beer
but
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
d
easy
to
throw
back
but
would
like
something
with
more
flavor
ive
had
better
light
beers
ill
buy
something
else
the
next
time
i
buy
a
light
beer
you
should
probably
do
the
same
in
my
opinion
i
have
nothing
else
to
say
on
this
one
but
it
makes
me
type
more
words
please
make
it
stop
please
okay
this
should
finally
get
me
to
250
overall
a
good
light
beer
good
for
people
watching
what
they
eat
drink
not
as
full
flavored
as
the
flagship
lager
but
not
bad
and
a
great
buy
too
smells
a
little
nutty
like
peanut
butter
with
a
surprising
maltiness
pours
to
a
light
golden
color
with
hardly
any
head
that
dissapears
fast
taste
is
malty
but
light
with
a
slightly
tarty
and
crisp
hoppiness
but
really
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
has
good
body
and
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
fizz
but
still
a
little
thin
this
is
a
tastier
beer
than
i
was
expecting
when
i
saw
it
was
light
being
a
3
4
beer
i
am
even
more
impressed
you
can
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
great
flavor
for
the
style
it
is
incredible
this
blows
the
doors
off
any
bmc
light
or
bmc
for
that
matter
for
the
price
its
a
steal
drinkability
its
ok
for
a
light
lager
d
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
good
beer
d
it
was
real
easy
to
drink
but
just
not
much
flavor
all
and
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
ive
had
better
light
lagers
overall
one
of
the
best
light
lagers
i
have
had
but
by
no
means
good
had
one
of
these
tonight
because
thats
whats
in
ma
fridgerator
haha
fairly
lackluster
appearance
pale
small
head
not
much
in
the
nose
some
faint
grain
and
also
faint
sweetness
flavor
is
better
than
most
light
bmcs
but
thats
not
saying
much
there
is
a
bite
of
raw
grain
in
the
back
bit
of
corny
sweetness
balanced
by
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
well
it
goes
down
with
more
ease
than
bud
light
or
mich
ultra
but
im
just
not
much
of
a
light
beer
guy
basicially
a
watered
down
version
of
the
original
yuengling
lager
unlike
the
real
lager
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
thick
and
distinctive
dark
color
but
a
light
seethru
red
that
leaves
no
discernable
head
or
lacings
offers
an
even
fainter
hop
aroma
then
the
lager
and
contains
little
in
smell
other
than
grain
watery
and
a
little
like
drinking
half
a
lager
with
h2o
mixed
in
some
hops
present
but
no
real
citric
taste
or
malts
like
the
lager
and
instead
of
the
signature
crisp
backbite
of
the
lager
it
just
goes
down
silky
and
smooth
if
you
want
a
light
beer
for
the
taste
get
sam
adams
light
if
you
want
a
light
beer
for
diet
reasons
get
a
miller
or
something
this
is
better
than
most
macro
lights
but
i
cant
drink
this
when
the
premium
lager
is
right
next
to
it
in
the
cooler
overall
lawnmower
beer
d
not
a
difficult
beer
to
throw
back
a
few
of
but
its
obvious
watery
character
coupled
with
lack
of
flavor
make
this
a
subpar
beer
to
say
the
least
dextremly
drinkablebut
at
what
cost
to
your
pride
and
dignity
d
now
i
know
why
this
is
so
damn
thin
and
watery
there
is
barely
any
booze
in
this
damn
beer
2
7
youve
gotta
be
kidding
me
even
though
this
is
a
relatively
cheap
beer
catching
a
buzz
on
this
soda
pop
could
be
expensive
feels
thin
and
watery
though
unobtrusive
gone
at
the
swallow
its
pleasant
enough
for
a
light
lager
but
offers
little
in
the
way
of
body
dark
yellow
pour
nice
solid
head
crisp
with
very
little
after
taste
even
color
with
a
hint
of
various
malts
almost
makes
you
forget
your
drinking
a
litght
beer
or
is
it
noticed
that
it
freezes
faster
than
most
beers
though
which
is
surprises
me
overall
pointless
just
like
any
light
beer
half
the
flavor
half
the
alcohol
what
again
is
the
point
of
light
beers
pours
a
clear
orange
with
fast
fading
white
head
and
spotty
lacing
smell
caramel
malt
hint
of
diacetyl
taste
watered
down
yuengling
lager
watery
caramel
malt
and
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
quite
watery
decent
light
beer
from
yuengling
but
not
quite
sa
light
d
you
could
drink
this
all
day
and
not
even
get
a
buzz
one
of
the
better
tasting
lights
ive
had
very
clear
dark
gold
colour
with
a
thin
white
skim
of
bubbles
that
settled
to
a
coarse
ring
minimal
lacing
with
fair
head
retention
floralsulfury
hops
in
the
aroma
plus
some
sugary
malt
and
maybe
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
light
bitterness
with
a
mild
sweetness
lemony
hops
lingered
very
light
bodied
nearly
watery
with
assertive
carbonation
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
inoffensive
but
not
much
flavour
one
of
the
better
light
lagers
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
light
lager
ill
prefer
over
the
bmc
lights
on
any
day
watered
down
but
true
to
yuengling
form
the
c
rating
this
beer
has
is
accurate

its
completely
average
i
drank
it
this
past
weekend
and
remember
thinking
it
tasted
a
bit
like
heineken
mouthfeel
is
low
drinkability
is
high
the
rest
average
the
only
reason
to
get
this
is
if
youre
in
pa
and
you
consider
it
a
local
brew
tawny
yellow
orange
body
with
a
soft
swiftly
dissapating
head
moderately
effervescent
dark
for
a
light
beer
sharp
malt
accents
quite
strong
for
a
light
lager
too
reminiscent
of
the
original
smooth
slightly
flat
and
creamy
palate
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
short
taste
of
woody
sweetnesslight
in
th
finish
with
hints
of
roasted
malt
yuenglings
light
maintains
much
of
the
originals
flavor
traits
for
the
better
now
if
i
only
liked
drinking
light
beers
flavor
is
very
bready
not
as
light
as
i
expected
which
is
nice
faint
hops
unlike
most
light
lagers
ive
tried
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
wincing
aftertaste
and
actually
has
a
little
bit
of
flavor
its
very
subtle
given
the
style
but
i
was
impressed
this
is
probably
the
worst
beer
brewed
by
d
g
yuengling
and
sons
it
has
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
but
thats
the
only
thing
they
got
right
the
smell
has
something
off
about
it
and
it
follows
to
the
taste
the
taste
is
what
threw
me
off
and
i
dont
really
like
this
beer
it
has
a
sweet
taste
to
it
sweeter
than
the
traditional
lager
and
premium
but
the
sweet
taste
is
almost
artificial
i
think
the
best
way
to
describe
it
is
to
go
from
drinking
regular
coke
to
diet
coke
and
not
enjoying
the
difference
the
artificial
sweetness
is
not
good
to
this
beer
and
is
probably
why
it
is
a
light
lager
dont
try
it
if
you
like
the
traditional
lager
not
worth
it
d
i
would
take
this
beer
over
any
other
light
lager
ive
had
the
taste
though
simple
and
sweet
was
enjoyable
and
the
drinking
was
easy
mouthfeel
well
pitiful
mouthfeel
is
bland
and
lifeless
i
suppose
if
this
were
really
cold
and
i
was
in
the
right
mood
drinkability
could
potentially
be
as
high
as
3
0
so
there
thats
about
all
i
have
for
kind
words
regarding
this
thing
still
glad
i
tried
another
offering
from
such
a
legendary
u
s
brewer
went
out
to
applebees
and
it
was
this
or
a
bmc
combo
so
i
had
to
go
with
the
yiuengling
well
i
guess
yuengling
isnt
really
a
macro
but
still
a
light
lager
so
i
went
ahead
and
added
it
to
the
same
category
poured
a
decent
amber
with
a
small
white
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
and
very
clear
consistency
at
least
the
tone
has
a
decent
reddish
tint
smell
was
full
of
grains
and
not
really
much
else
slight
hint
at
a
caramel
or
sugar
sweetness
but
very
slight
and
only
as
it
warmed
the
taste
was
a
little
musty
grain
corn
and
grass
flavors
were
the
big
players
here
slight
amount
of
caramel
trying
to
come
through
but
never
really
made
it
the
feel
was
very
smooth
decent
body
not
as
light
as
some
others
overall
it
had
a
bit
more
of
a
flavor
profile
then
some
of
the
others
did
but
still
needs
a
little
work
i
actually
liked
this
slightly
better
then
the
premium
lager
go
figure
it
seemed
a
bit
more
well
wounded
the
lager
seemed
too
bready
to
me
this
was
a
decent
light
beer
for
a
light
beer
this
isnt
too
bad
has
some
head
not
much
lacing
and
tastes
sweetish
and
light
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
smell
is
slightly
skunky
but
doesnt
show
up
in
the
taste
has
no
aftertaste
and
is
crisp
and
smooth
highly
drinkable
and
extremely
low
abv
i
would
say
not
horrible
for
style
but
not
much
to
it
at
all
except
some
maltiness
that
is
often
lacking
in
light
beers
increasingly
annoying
aftertaste
brings
it
down
in
my
book
for
a
light
beer
i
suppose
its
okay
though
not
much
better
than
so
many
other
light
beers
why
bother
glad
i
only
had
one
sample
it
was
enough
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
body
with
a
white
head
does
not
hold
for
the
whole
beer
and
there
really
is
not
much
of
a
lacing
leftover
the
smell
reminded
me
of
the
other
macrolagers
some
kind
of
a
maltalcohol
hybrid
on
my
nostrils
the
taste
was
pretty
good
tasted
like
a
nice
light
lager
with
a
bit
if
a
yuengling
lager
twist
on
it
that
was
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
me
even
for
a
light
lager
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
light
refreshing
and
not
filling
at
all
definitely
worth
a
shot
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
it
never
made
sense
to
me
to
try
yuengling
lager
worked
just
fine
and
i
didnt
need
to
watch
the
calories
so
why
change
ended
up
having
it
on
a
bartenders
screw
up
and
here
we
are
actually
looks
pretty
good
golden
color
with
a
little
head
nose
is
standard
lager
scent
corn
and
grain
taste
is
similar
tastes
almost
exactly
like
a
lager
feel
is
weak
thinner
than
id
like
overall
not
a
bad
light
lager
but
then
again
theres
no
real
reason
to
get
this
unless
youre
trying
to
lose
weight
d
well
you
can
have
this
after
a
workout
or
lawn
mowing
when
its
really
hot
because
its
almost
water
with
a
bit
of
the
flavor
from
y
amber
its
better
than
bigger
macro
lights
but
ic
light
is
a
better
drinker
if
you
must
drink
light
this
is
beer
i
know
the
rules
say
not
to
slam
a
beer
but
i
dont
think
this
qualified
as
beer
maybe
i
got
a
hold
of
a
bottle
from
a
lousy
batch
color
is
typical
strawyellow
aroma
is
weak
and
unimpressive
taste
is
very
thin
more
like
water
than
beer
it
reminds
me
of
the
quip
that
light
beers
are
like
doing
gymnastics
on
the
beach
flipping
close
to
water
on
a
side
note
atlanta
does
not
have
yuengling
in
any
stores
so
for
me
it
is
always
exciting
going
anywhere
out
of
town
to
buy
it
pretty
nondescript
light
in
all
facets
basically
no
aroma
except
for
a
very
faint
grain
hop
detection
the
color
is
very
watery
looking
and
overcarbonated
no
real
head
to
speak
of
tastes
more
grainy
than
malty
but
the
lightness
keeps
it
from
becomming
a
disaster
light
notes
of
green
apples
and
metailic
note
in
the
flavor
accompany
the
grains
feels
acidic
and
prickley
with
a
mild
hop
linger
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
brew
taste
is
a
disappointment
mostly
bland
carbonation
with
thin
malt
flavors
and
no
hops
to
speak
of
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
a
light
beer
but
i
guess
i
made
the
mistake
of
getting
my
hopes
up
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
just
not
enough
taste
for
anything
other
than
emergency
consumption
falls
in
the
macrolights
just
above
average
like
it
does
with
the
lager
light
color
no
head
no
lacing
some
maltiness
takes
it
above
coors
light
etc
overcarbonated
and
watered
down
at
the
same
time
this
is
really
not
a
bad
offering
for
the
style
but
besides
parched
thirstiness
this
is
not
a
beer
drinkers
beer
taste
is
in
between
miller
lite
and
sam
light
if
i
was
really
concerned
about
those
extra
calories
i
would
be
upset
that
this
light
isnt
avail
in
my
area
but
im
just
not
much
of
a
light
beer
drinker
and
when
i
am
miller
lite
is
about
the
same
quality
as
this
this
isnt
in
the
same
league
as
say
sam
adams
light
lager
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
factor
in
the
low
price
and
low
alcohol
and
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
you
could
drink
all
day
if
need
be
great
beer
great
price
p
c
c
i
bought
a
12
pack
of
this
to
drink
during
the
national
championship
at
a
buddys
house
the
game
was
great
go
gators
the
beer
was
awful
it
looked
average
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
nice
frothy
head
that
laced
the
glass
unfortunately
that
was
the
best
thing
about
it
it
smelled
like
grassy
earth
and
tasted
about
the
same
the
taste
was
very
bland
similar
to
a
bud
light
i
drink
2
and
went
to
the
store
to
buy
more
beer
at
half
time
and
left
the
other
10
to
the
free
beer
fund
d
id
pass
unless
you
were
looking
for
a
very
low
abv
beer
to
pound
over
many
many
many
hours
the
caloric
increase
up
to
lager
is
not
that
significant
so
take
the
dive
dammit
yuengling
is
a
great
complement
to
most

although
i
enjoy
it
with
a
nice
summer
barbecue
or
typical
bar
foods
a
really
nice
brozish
coppery
color
with
a
solid
light
tan
head
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
looks
good
smell
is
weak
a
bit
metallic
some
bready
notes
in
there
taste
is
just
not
enjoyable
obviously
watery
but
also
a
touch
of
canned
sweet
corn
but
also
some
plastic
and
metallic
flavors
esp
at
the
end
not
even
a
good
choice
if
youre
watching
your
carbs
not
bad
at
all
for
a
light
beer
but
i
cant
really
recommend
it
unless
you
absolutely
require
a
low
carb
beer
nonoffensive
nonchallenging
low
alcohol
light
beer
whats
the
point
not
thaaat
bad
for
a
light
lager
but
not
as
good
as
sam
light
i
would
suggest
getting
real
beer
instead
d
not
very
pleasing
at
least
the
regular
lager
challenges
you
to
keep
drinking
this
doesnt
even
put
up
a
fight
bland
cheers
overall
a
drinkable
light
beer
certainly
better
than
bmc
but
nothing
special
however
at
99
calories
it
truly
is
a
light
beer
yuengling
light
lager
pours
a
surprisingly
dark
color
for
a
light
lager
almost
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
corn
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
tastes
like
adjunct
seems
like
there
is
an
off
flavor
i
cant
really
place
it
but
its
not
overwhelming
reasonably
drinkable
light
lager
light
brownishamber
with
a
small
slightly
offwhite
tight
head
that
diminishes
to
a
film
smells
of
sweet
grain
and
floral
hops
with
a
little
brown
sugar
lightly
hoppy
and
very
bready
flavor
mild
but
nice
mediumlight
body
slick
texture
moderate
carbonation
not
bat
at
all
for
a
light
beer
drinkability
if
i
have
to
drink
a
light
beer
this
is
the
one
that
i
would
choose
poured
a
medium
amber
color
with
moderate
white
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
thin
coating
smell
is
very
minimal
with
only
a
mild
sweetness
to
be
found
taste
is
more
of
the
smell
with
much
less
character
than
their
regular
lager
with
a
bit
too
light
for
myn
taste
finish
is
also
light
with
little
of
anything
to
be
found
drinkabilty
to
good
mostly
due
to
the
low
alcohol
content
drinkability
not
being
a
light
beer
fan
i
was
surprised
that
this
didnt
offend
my
tastebuds
in
relation
to
the
light
lager
style
so
this
is
nicely
drinkable
in
my
book
choose
this
over
the
bmc
alternatives
if
you
need
to
drink
a
light
beer
the
color
is
a
dull
gold
with
a
big
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
little
froth
all
the
way
down
it
smells
of
faint
barley
the
taste
isnt
bad
for
a
light
beer
there
is
a
little
malt
presence
not
hops
but
no
corn
rice
or
adjuncts
either
it
honestly
feels
about
what
an
all
malt
lager
fells
like
rather
than
a
light
beer
overall
its
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
the
best
light
beers
out
there
poured
a
yellowish
amber
color
with
small
head
of
foam
that
dissipated
very
fast
and
left
no
rings
or
lace
whatsoever
the
only
good
part
was
all
those
carboantion
bubbles
in
the
pilsner
glass
the
only
aroma
was
that
of
faint
malts
and
hops
and
nothing
else
the
taste
was
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
slight
malty
aftertaste
to
it
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
watery
and
light
but
not
as
watery
like
most
macro
light
beers
overall
this
was
an
above
average
light
beer
with
more
taste
and
better
mouthfeel
than
most
light
beers
if
you
want
a
light
beer
and
cant
find
sam
adams
light
then
this
would
make
a
nice
substitute
my
first
offering
from
yuengling
poured
out
to
a
deep
yellow
orange
color
with
a
small
white
foamy
head
that
calmed
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
over
the
surface
of
the
beer
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
brewery
fresh
ingredients
was
very
enjoyable
malt
hops
and
grain
were
all
light
but
notable
taste
was
a
definite
step
up
from
your
typical
light
lager
flavors
of
lightly
roasted
malt
rich
grain
and
some
tea
like
lingering
taste
went
very
well
together
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
with
the
carbonation
adding
some
crisp
zesty
character
good
drinkability
i
would
have
this
over
any
other
light
beer
out
there
today
recommended
for
light
beer
lovers
special
thanks
to
oldfrothingslosh
for
the
sample
overall
i
love
this
light
beer
best
in
the
us
for
a
light
beer
an
honest
light
beer
a
touch
weak
in
alcohol
but
a
nice
example
of
an
american
light
lager
i
like
it
drinkability
i
dont
want
this
again
ever
i
could
use
it
as
a
session
beer
but
at
2
75
abv
i
might
as
well
put
a
drop
of
kirschwasser
in
a
big
glass
of
water
that
would
taste
like
water
and
get
the
same
alcohol
in
my
system
since
the
carbonation
numbs
your
mouth
it
could
be
eaten
with
bad
food
some
one
could
serve
it
at
their
dinner
party
to
conceal
the
fact
that
their
cooking
tastes
terrible
other
than
that
this
is
best
left
on
the
shelves
drinkability
this
went
down
extremely
well
but
perhaps
too
well
for
what
i
expected
out
of
this
beer
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
medium
gold
body
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dwindles
to
a
thin
wisp
of
collar
aroma
is
nearly
void
so
i
cant
rate
it
as
awful
some
faint
grainess
is
barely
noticed
mouthfeel
is
very
light
bodied
with
lots
of
crisp
carbonation
taste
is
watery
and
fizzy
slight
notes
of
caramel
malt
are
easily
balanced
by
subdued
hops
bitterness
clean
finish
and
aftertaste
make
this
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
but
i
dont
see
any
point
in
trying
this
one
again
clean
aroma
on
the
nose
light
graininess
faint
hops
tastebuds
pick
up
a
nice
small
hint
how
sweetnesscaramel
graininess
and
hint
of
hops
very
good
drinkability
will
i
ever
drink
this
again
i
have
no
reason
to
drink
this
over
the
traditional
lager
drinkability
this
goes
down
ultra
easy
philly
town
has
plenty
of
other
great
micros
turn
this
one
down
decided
at
first
that
i
would
pass
on
ordering
any
alcohol
at
a
pizza
pub
and
watering
hole
however
ive
enjoyed
yuenglings
lager
and
black
tans
so
i
thought
what
the
heck
the
entire
time
im
sipping
i
am
disappointed
too
much
lemon
flavor
for
a
light
beerits
sad
to
say
but
i
would
order
a
miller
light
instead
of
this
next
time
light
amber
color
clear
liquid
with
a
sodapop
white
head
it
probably
looks
better
than
most
light
beers
but
its
not
perfectly
enticing
faint
malt
aroma
taste
is
grainlike
and
very
dry
not
much
hops
and
certainly
not
bitter
average
to
high
carbonation
this
is
a
middleofthe
road
light
beer
notably
pointless
tastes
alright
for
a
light
lager
havent
had
too
many
light
lagers
but
this
one
is
ok
watery
in
the
mouth
sweet
shallow
malts
tangy
soft
empty
carbonation
very
clean
aftertaste
i
think
i
probably
like
sam
adams
light
better
this
beer
smells
like
a
farm
head
goes
away
quickly
the
beer
has
a
great
amber
appearance
but
that
is
the
only
saving
grace
tastes
okay
mouthfeel
is
smooth
drinkabliity
is
great
considering
the
insulting
abv
not
worth
it
i
am
not
sure
why
yuengling
bothered
to
make
this
beer
it
really
isnt
a
good
product
its
light
beer
that
costs
less
than
5
six
pack
and
ill
be
buying
more
of
it
this
is
really
an
utterly
worthless
beer
i
mean
whats
the
point
of
it
being
low
in
calories
if
you
dont
get
some
pleasure
out
of
it
youre
certainly
not
going
to
get
a
buzz
at
2
7
abv
i
can
give
you
a
good
asskicking
that
will
be
low
in
calories
too
you
might
even
bleed
a
ounces
off
is
this
a
selling
point
i
ended
up
at
a
cookout
this
evening
and
there
was
nothing
available
to
drink
other
than
four
kinds
of
macroswill
yuengling
light
being
one
of
the
domestic
varieties
along
with
budweiser
the
imported
swills
included
corona
and
konigsburg
instead
of
leaving
and
embarrasing
my
family
i
took
this
as
an
opportunity
to
try
some
beers
i
had
not
had
in
over
two
years
i
wish
i
had
just
left
i
drank
this
straight
out
of
the
bottle
so
i
had
no
real
sense
of
its
appearance
but
if
the
smell
and
taste
were
any
indication
it
would
be
weak
there
was
no
aroma
to
speak
of
and
taste
was
bland
at
best
in
simplest
term
this
brew
is
worthless
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
dry
musty
scent
with
little
malts
and
fewer
hops
the
taste
is
average
also
it
is
light
dry
and
musty
with
a
very
watery
grainy
malt
makeup
it
goes
down
easy
but
lacks
any
real
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
an
extremely
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
light
beer
there
is
nothing
special
here
i
found
this
to
be
dryer
than
most
its
one
and
done
for
me
appearance
copper
golden
amber
forms
a
thin
shortlived
off
white

no

left
at
all
aroma
mild
grainy

touch

very
bland
all
in

taste
an

comes
off
a
bit
tart
and
bready
with
no
finishing
flavors
starts
off
a
decent
sweetness
then
boom
nothing
not
aftertaste
nothing
there
water
mouthfeel
watery
thin
spritzy
carbonation
cant
believe
they
produce
this
beer
drinkability
i
guess
you
could
drink
alot
of
it
2
7abv
and
watery
mouthfeel
but
why
would
you
waste
your
time
with
flavorless
beer
taste
has
a
better
malt
profile
than
i
had
expected
lightly
sweet
and
hints
of
nuttiness
light
hops
finish
however
overall
it
is
too
watery
and
doesnt
have
much
aftertaste
very
thin
very
drinkable
though
and
as
far
as
light
lagers
go
this
one
isnt
offensive
this
beer
poured
a
caramelamber
color
into
the
glass
and
was
crystal
clear
and
well
carbonated
the
head
that
was
formed
when
vigorously
poured
was
off
white
in
color
and
lasted
only
a
second
then
quickly
fell
to
nothing
not
even
a
ring
on
the
edges
no
lace
was
resent
the
aroma
that
came
from
the
glass
to
be
honest
was
a
weaker
version
of
the
regular
lager
i
nosed
light
toasted
malts
and
some
citrus
hops
again
faint
in
the
nose
the
tastes
that
came
over
my
tongue
were
light
as
well
some
malts
sweet
and
roasted
light
caramel
grainshusks
hops
and
some
bready
dough
as
it
finished
the
aftertaste
was
light
and
wisps
of
corn
and
malt
came
forth
as
it
warmed
the
body
was
light
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
lager
and
choose
not
to
drink
it
the
light
is
actually
better
and
more
easily
drinkable
not
the
greatest
beer
but
in
a
class
of
light
beers
this
one
stands
above
the
rest
this
is
a
light
beer
that
you
can
pass
off
to
your
macro
friends
its
decent
for
what
it
is
and
if
youre
going
to
drink
light
beer
then
why
not
back
these
guys
up
instead
of
supporting
the
big
dogs
not
the
best
light
beer
but
very
acceptable
at
least
they
dont
have
stupid
commercials
with
people
hollerin
and
yellin
this
beer
has
good
color
but
a
head
which
quickly
disipates
the
other
characteristics
can
all
be
described
as
ok
so
all
in
all
nothing
special
but
good
for
a
light
not
really
a
light
beer
drinker
but
gave
this
one
a
go
ver
carbonated
however
the
wite
head
had
next
ot
no
staying
power
the
smell
was
quite
faint
nothing
really
detectable
there
tastes
ok
no
hops
seemed
to
be
present
and
if
they
were
they
must
been
hiding
or
something
very
watery
pehaps
they
just
tool
their
lage
and
added
some
water
ok
for
a
light
and
nothing
else
f
defintely
one
of
the
better
looking
light
beers
but
its
all
about
taste
which
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
ill
take
it
any
day
over
budmillercoors
light
but
id
also
take
a
regular
yuengling
over
this
if
for
some
reason
you
want
to
drink
this
beer
buy
a
case
of
the
regular
lager
and
24
empty
bottles
proceed
to
pour
half
of
each
lager
into
an
empty
bottle
and
fill
the
rest
up
with
water
now
you
have
two
cases
now
the
final
step
is
to
send
me
your
leftover
money
beermail
me
and
ill
give
you
an
address
this
rating
is
in
comparison
to
other
light
beers
it
has
a
clear
carbonated
light
gold
look
more
color
than
most
lights
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
note
to
the
nose
caramel
white
head
diapated
quickly
to
a
slight
constant
white
sheen
sweetish
malt
water
taste
with
cardboard
notes
in
the
finish
oxidation
the
mouth
is
quite
full
and
smooth
for
a
light
beer
i
gave
it
slightly
above
average
marks
because
in
comparison
to
the
macro
lights
and
the
light
imports
this
beer
has
more
in
the
way
of
mouth
taste
and
appearance
golden
to
amber
in
color
the
held
quickly
melts
into
a
coarse
layer
the
only
aroma
that
i
could
pick
out
is
something
like
caramel
but
not
a
rich
malty
caramel
instead
this
smelled
very
artificial
like
womens
caramelscented
shower
gel
husky
tasting
with
little
malt
flavor
hops
too
are
light
but
appropriate
considering
the
malt
flavor
tight
carbonation
and
very
light
but
not
watery
mouthfeel
overall
pretty
boring
but
still
one
of
the
better
light
beers
out
there
medium
amber
light
carbonation
crisp
mouthfeel
slightly
sweet
malt
character
balanced
by
subtle
hop
bitterness
finishes
slightly
sweet
here
it
is
yuengling
traditional
lager
is
yuengling
premium
lager
with
a
caramel
coloring
called
porterine
added
same
beer
different
color
yuengling
light
is
watered
down
yuengling
premium
lager
therefore
this
is
basically
yuengling
light
with
food
coloring
there
is
nothing
special
about
it
the
porterine
does
give
a
very
slight
flavor
but
its
basically
insignificant
at
this
level
if
you
like
the
light
and
its
not
bad
compared
to
other
lights
then
youll
like
this
otherwise
forget
it
in
the
world
of
light
beers
this
one
is
good
there
is
actually
some
taste
to
it
albeit
not
much
not
as
good
as
sam
adams
light
however
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
ggggllllooooddddd
the
smell
actually
tells
you
a
lot
about
this
beer
as
it
has
some
malt
sweetness
which
could
have
adjunct
or
not
it
isnt
obvious
but
it
is
sweet
and
the
flavor
is
gentle
with
the
carbonation
whisking
it
away
and
leaving
the
mouth
dry
with
a
slight
tangy
yeast
tinge
overall
pleasant
but
not
memorable
pretty
average
yet
not
offensive
it
is
a
palate
cleanser
if
there
ever
was
one
the
downside
to
diabetes
is
not
being
able
to
drink
beers
i
loved
red
stripe
was
a
favorite
and
chock
full
of
carbs
red
stripe
light
still
delivers
some
of
that
jamaican
flavor
while
cutting
the
carbs
down
to
ten
per
bottle
it
has
a
better
flavor
than
most
american
light
beers
if
you
like
rs
regular
and
can
no
longer
drink
it
give
the
light
a
try
now
if
they
could
come
up
with
a
lowcarb
dunkel
sigh
the
taste
was
leaning
towards
hoppy
and
had
a
semibitter
dry
finish
i
found
it
refreshing
and
just
what
i
needed
at
the
time
this
is
not
the
srot
of
beer
id
normally
buy
but
it
was
sunny
hot
and
i
was
in
jamaica
overall
not
really
for
me
but
pretty
average
for
the
style
does
anyone
really
drink
this
for
real
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
more
watery
than
anything
else
not
worth
the
effort
to
even
try
it
ill
pass
on
ever
intentionally
drinking
this
again
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
quite
lager
like
and
a
sweet
buttery
smell
in
the
taste
a
small
sweet
note
of
butter
but
really
a
lack
of
flavor
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
note
of
dryness
and
quite
clean
aftertaste
so
no
flavor
or
aftertaste
but
a
little
buttery
note
hooray
beer
rjt
not
sure
why
but
i
felt
compelled
to
try
this
tonight
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
dirtywhite
foam
the
nose
is
nearly
nonexistent
with
only
a
vague
powderedsugarlike
sweetness
and
a
mild
cornmeal
finding
their
ways
to
my
strils
the
taste
holds
notes
of
hard
water
rocks
very
light
and
vague
vegetable
matter
and
a
tiny
touch
of
sweetness
man
this
stuff
is
more
like
weirdtasting
water
than
a
beer
the
body
is
pretty
damn
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
unsurprisingly
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
sad
beer
i
got
nuthin
else
o
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
easily
since
there
isnt
much
to
the
beer
likewise
not
filling
at
all
extremely
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
poured
a
2
bight
white
soap
suds
head
clear
very
light
straw
yellow
color
smells
mildly
of
sour
corn
taste
is
basically
water
with
an
after
taste
of
grain
and
a
slight
acidic
zing
honestly
its
not
the
worst
light
beer
ive
had
but
like
pretty
much
all
the
rest
its
not
much
more
than
water
o
not
a
lot
to
go
on
very
drinkable
in
large
quantities
but
would
prefer
a
lager
with
more
heft
o
overall
this
light
low
alcohol
lager
is
probably
pretty
good
in
jamaica
its
not
too
bad
on
a
100
degree
day
in
nebraska
however
this
is
a
mediocre
at
best
easily
forgettable
beer
and
i
get
about
one
less
in
a
12
pack
i
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
compare
this
to
rolling
rock
which
i
had
earlier
tonight
and
struggled
to
find
words
for
the
ultralight
flavor
overall
its
a
light
lager
i
dont
like
this
kind
of
beer
but
to
be
fair
i
know
what
it
is
that
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
and
it
does
it
pretty
well
d
i
was
glad
when
they
repaired
the
taps
because
this
stuff
just
wasnt
hitting
the
spot
worth
a
try
if
you
like
light
lagers
but
i
would
recommend
the
regular
red
stripe
over
their
toned
down
watery
version
d
skunky
makes
it
fail
on
top
of
thin
watery
crap
beer
taste
a
session
beer
both
by
definition
and
by
drinkability
light
and
crisp
and
mindless
good
drunk
beer
d
not
bad
would
probably
drink
again
if
i
wanted
a
decent
light
beer
d
might
be
better
on
a
very
hot
sumer
day
probably
even
better
in
jamaica
from
the
11
2
fl
oz
stubby
bottle
sampled
on
december
28
2010
the
pour
is
straw
yellow
with
busy
carbonation
leading
up
to
a
oneinch
fizzy
white
head
that
simmers
down
after
a
bit
the
aroma
pulls
together
grass
and
malts
with
a
hint
of
hoppiness
and
accompanying
adjuncts
the
bidy
is
thin
to
medium
which
is
not
unusual
with
a
light
beer
the
taste
is
also
grassy
and
malty
for
a
light
beer
it
is
fairly
drinkable
taste
is
pretty
basic
and
utilitarian
wet
grain
and
mild
sweetness
suggesting
apple
and
corn
again
feels
fizzy
yet
dry
and
clean
super
easy
to
drink
without
thinking
about
it
pretty
average
lager
with
no
off
flavors
i
will
say
that
this
is
better
than
a
lot
of
light
lagers
out
there
however
its
still
not
enough
to
make
me
want
to
drink
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
light
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
little
hop
character
and
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
pilsner
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
quick
and
easy
with
a
bone
dry
finish
it
doesnt
taste
much
different
from
the
original
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
refreshing
light
lager
again
if
you
like
the
original
this
isnt
much
different
and
you
can
sleep
better
knowing
its
better
for
you
d
if
youre
going
to
drink
a
light
lager
this
might
actually
not
be
an
awful
way
to
go
by
no
means
amazing
but
there
are
definitely
worse
options
clean
grains
and
a
high
carbonation
just
about
sum
this
one
up
a
brief
flash
of
drying
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
i
am
not
even
sure
that
is
from
hops
its
thirst
quenching
and
is
actually
a
pretty
well
brewed
lager
to
be
so
clean
i
dont
really
detect
any
flaws
here
not
to
say
i
really
like
it
but
i
dont
dislike
the
beer
d
okay
gulpable
just
flavorless
my
aunt
picked
up
a
sixer
becase
red
stripe
regular
is
a
refreshing
summer
beer
and
why
not
try
the
light
not
is
the
optimal
word
with
the
low
3
6
abv
there
is
no
taste
of
alcohol
at
all
in
here
so
theyre
really
easy
to
down
the
problem
i
have
with
it
is
that
its
not
really
very
beerlike
overall
stick
with
regular
red
stripe
d
great
for
warm
weather
a
crisp
beer
typical
for
a
light
beer
but
this
one
does
stand
above
many
others
red
stripe
light
was
a
very
light
golden
color
with
good
clarity
it
has
a
white
fizzy
head
that
quickly
dissipated
with
no
lacing
it
had
a
light
beer
smell
to
it
it
tasted
fairly
close
to
the
regular
just
lighter
in
taste
and
body
the
finish
was
dry
and
crisp
mouthfeel
was
light
body
with
prickly
carbonation
drinkability
was
above
average
overall
it
was
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
quite
refreshing
but
the
original
is
better
cheers
clear
yellow
pour
looks
like
any
light
beer
this
stuff
is
downright
horrible
worse
than
other
light
beers
bud
coors
miller
etc
fain
maltiness
and
a
horrible
sickly
metallic
taste
very
watery
i
like
a
good
light
lager
on
a
hot
day
at
a
bbq
but
this
stuff
is
awful
probably
better
in
jamaica
with
the
regular
version
why
why
the
hell
not
im
going
to
clear
the
air
here
and
say
that
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
stubby
bottle
cute
little
bastards
get
me
every
time
oh
and
if
it
would
have
come
in
that
weird
10
5oz
clear
bottle
seen
over
there
well
buddy
i
wouldnt
have
purchased
it
well
i
dont
know
about
that
10
5
oz
is
one
odd
size
and
i
like
odd
sized
bottles
too
i
dont
think
i
like
them
the
way
i
like
stubby
bottles
though
there
is
just
this
sort
of
romantic
feeling
i
get
from
a
stubby
bottle
i
cant
quite
grasp
why
this
is
not
the
standard
the
design
seems
so
much
more
drinky
if
i
may
so
much
more
conducive
to
drinking
beer
than
the
long
neck
i
dont
know
why
i
feel
this
way
its
a
psychological
thing
really
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
i
can
do
to
explain
it
i
am
very
lucky
though
a
new
brewery
in
iowa
peace
tree
brewing
is
bottling
exclusively
in
stubbys
the
cool
thing
about
peace
tree
is
that
i
love
their
beer
which
basically
means
that
ill
not
be
swayed
by
the
undeniable
charm
of
the
red
stripe
bottle
again
arevaderche
jamaican
lager
hola
hop
wrangler
on
with
the
rating
now
this
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
nice
medium
sized
tight
head
i
swear
to
you
that
the
first
thing
i
detect
in
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
chicken
crock
pot
roasted
chicken
its
a
pretty
specific
smell
and
one
that
i
am
very
familiar
with
when
i
come
home
from
work
to
find
the
aroma
of
the
chicken
i
was
forced
to
wake
up
a
whole
ten
minutes
early
that
morning
to
throw
into
a
cooking
device
my
aunt
nancy
uncle
don
gave
me
this
is
a
joyous
smell
but
it
serves
very
little
if
any
place
in
the
world
of
beer
i
guess
this
is
one
of
those
things
that
makes
me
realize
how
damned
inexperienced
of
a
brewer
i
am
oh
my
beers
suffer
from
all
the
usual
problems
a
bit
tart
here
a
little
vegetal
there
maybe
a
bit
too
many
hops
for
this
style
or
a
damned
thin
mouth
feel
but
never
in
my
life
have
i
come
across
any
sort
of
process
or
technical
flaw
that
would
make
my
beer
smell
like
a
roasted
chicken
just
damned
fascinating
along
with
the
chicken
weve
got
some
complimentary
aromas
some
corn
and
some
herbal
hoppiness
the
flavor
for
all
its
short
comings
is
so
much
of
a
relief
as
compared
to
the
aroma
that
im
happy
as
can
be
to
be
drinking
as
opposed
to
smelling
this
the
beer
is
basically
dry
and
very
light
on
flavor
but
has
some
bright
maltiness
a
little
corn
and
some
distinct
noble
hoppiness
this
is
very
refreshing
but
it
is
also
very
light
i
have
no
problem
with
beers
being
light
in
fact
i
am
very
for
it
but
this
one
certainly
falls
under
that
sacrificing
flavor
for
levity
thing
very
strongly
people
are
purchasing
this
for
nine
dollars
a
six
pack
that
is
really
happening
surreal
this
reminds
me
that
i
need
to
roast
a
chicken
very
drinkable
due
to
overall
lack
of
flavor
i
was
sitting
in
the
hot
sun
at
the
beach
and
this
was
the
beer
they
had
on
special
maybe
they
were
trying
to
get
rid
of
it
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
corn
and
malts
taste
is
crisp
some
grains
a
tad
more
flavor
than
other
light
beers
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
not
the
worst
light
beer
i
have
had
but
nothing
great
another
pale
fizzy
lager
this
one
is
a
light
straw
golde
color
with
heavy
streaming
carbonation
white
head
forms
thick
at
first
and
dwindles
quickly
down
to
nothing
thin
speckled
lacing
not
much
an
eye
candy
appeal
here
aroma
has
a
grainy
cooked
vegetable
grassy
tone
to
it
slightly
metallic
tone
going
on
as
well
its
really
hard
to
describe
because
theres
not
much
there
flavor
is
light
crisp
malt
sweetness
with
some
harsh
grassy
herbal
tones
blended
with
a
metallic
finish
mouthfeel
is
ligt
on
the
palate
but
carbonation
is
really
heav
for
some
reason
definitely
force
carbonated
drinkabilit
overall
is
an
average
light
lager
its
hard
to
complain
about
i
know
it
would
be
refreshing
if
in
the
caribbean
but
id
much
rather
stick
to
the
original
meh
unless
you
consider
yourself
a
fan
of
light
lagers
id
avoid
not
bad
average
at
best
d
overall
red
stripe
light
is
about
what
i
expected
it
to
be
a
pretty
typical
macro
light
lager
that
really
doesnt
stand
out
against
any
other
in
the
style
not
horribe
not
great
either
probably
wouldnt
purchase
again
smell
is
mostly
of
grains
although
it
does
have
a
very
slight
hint
of
citrusy
hop
aroma
taste
is
pretty
much
exactly
the
same
almost
identical
to
the
american
macros
but
with
a
tiny
bit
more
of
a
hop
presence
that
for
me
makes
it
slightly
more
enjoyable
very
light
bodied
almost
feels
like
carbonated
water
now
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
a
good
light
beer
not
a
excellent
beer
but
still
a
decent
summer
brew
i
would
buy
this
over
corona
drinkability
hooray
beerlite
while
it
probably
has
a
place
served
up
on
a
hot
sunny
beach
somewhere
its
just
not
too
terribly
enjoyable
here
in
georgia
during
the
waning
days
of
winter
had
it
on
the
beach
at
sandals
negril
it
was
much
easier
to
drink
in
the
heat
than
the
the
more
typical
red
stripe
its
a
very
light
tasting
beer
with
little
or
no
aftertaste
would
prefer
it
to
american
light
beers
and
would
definitely
purchase
again
if
only
they
sold
it
in
the
states
available
at
our
resort
so
i
ended
up
with
a
couple
of
these
rather
than
the
regular
red
stripe
crystal
clear
very
pale
yellow
with
a
bright
white
cap
that
didnt
last
long
light
aroma
cereal
grains
mostly
very
low
bitterness
mild
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
esters
bordering
on
watery
but
it
still
had
something
of
a
body
and
texture
medium
to
high
carbonation
seemed
to
be
a
little
too
much
not
much
here
so
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
liked
the
regular
stuff
a
lot
more
so
it
didnt
seem
to
make
sense
to
keep
going
back
for
more
of
this
to
my
surprise
i
like
this
one
its
a
light
beer
from
jamaica
so
its
exactly
what
youll
expect
and
is
a
nice
thirst
quencher
for
those
hot
jamaican
afternoons
aviable
on
tap
on
jamaicait
si
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
regular
red
stripe
however
it
is
okay
for
a
light
lager
it
isnt
nearly
as
watery
as
most
light
lagers
and
it
still
tastes
relatively
close
to
the
original
it
is
just
a
weaker
version
of
the
real
deal
drank
this
on
the
beach
in
jamaica
tasted
much
better
then
your
average
light
beer
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
its
bigger
brother
regular
red
stripe
clear
pour
very
little
head
very
little
odor
smooth
and
a
bit
watery
but
refreshing
and
does
the
job
its
made
to
do
i
could
and
did
drink
several
in
one
sitting
better
on
a
hot
day
in
jamaica
than
dragon
stout
for
sure
and
the
red
stripe
light
they
had
on
tap
did
not
cheer
me
up
much
the
regular
red
stripe
was
warm
and
i
wanted
a
cold
beer
the
color
was
a
sickly
yellow
with
a
thin
head
its
not
that
the
aroma
was
awful
but
more
that
there
was
simply
no
aroma
the
taste
was
corn
and
rice
no
malts
or
hops
while
it
looked
carbonated
big
bubbles
and
all
the
mouthfeel
was
flat
i
could
see
being
able
to
drink
this
beer
but
the
closest
comparison
i
can
think
of
is
carbonated
tap
water
not
much
to
it
but
its
par
for
the
course
with
light
beers
and
i
might
even
prefer
it
to
the
standard
american
macros
o
wouldnt
buy
again
but
not
bad
for
a
light
i
may
have
to
retry
this
one
i
see
all
the
favorable
reviews
i
thought
it
tasted
awful
did
i
just
get
a
bad
or
outdated
sixer
or
what
ive
tried
a
lot
of
beers
and
this
one
is
the
worst
says
review
optional
it
is
not
similar
tastes
to
grey
lady
nice
and
crisp
i
swear
this
tastes
like
some
belgian
ale
offshoot
for
a
low
cal
low
abv
it
is
delishous
for
sure
very
citrusy
and
thin
but
expected
for
a
light
beer
no
weird
aftertaste
finish
is
crisp
overall
a
good
light
lager
that
blows
away
the
bmc
crowd
but
only
negative
is
very
expensive

light
it
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
white
bread
mild
flowers
mild
grass
and
a
kiss
of
what
seems
to
me
to
be
tangelo
rind
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
lightness
in
the
name
and
the
smell
underlined
here
on
my
tongue
in
addition
the
bread
from
earlier
appears
to
have
taken
on
a
slight
sweetness
though
its
not
much
to
speak
of
the
body
is
appropriately
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
watery
feel
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
especially
considering
how
overwhelmingly
underwhelming
the
light
lager
style
has
become
over
the
years
but
its
overt
mildness
borders
far
too
much
on
boring
for
its
own
good
i
could
see
myself
drinking
another
at
some
point
in
the
future
but
its
unlikely
ill
have
paid
for
it
nice
beer
next
time
i
want
a
light
beer
ill
go
with
a
sam
adams
light
all
things
are
relative
and
this
light
lager
pours
with
nice
body
significant
aroma
and
great
taste
for
a
light
lager
the
body
is
clean
pale
straw
with
a
sizable
bright
white
head
the
aroma
is
lemony
with
nice
cereal
malts
and
a
pilsner
like
scent
the
taste
is
crisp
light
and
lemony
with
tea
leaf
malts
cereal
grains
and
an
almost
wheat
like
body
this
is
a
hugely
sessionable
lager
with
significant
personality
and
very
well
done
for
a
light
lager
sankaty
is
in
most
actuality
a
vienna
lager
but
in
the
shell
of
a
light
lager
as
a
viennastyle
beer
the
ale
sorely
misses
its
mark
in
body
and
hops
but
as
a
unique
american
light
lager
its
marketing
might
just
be
ingenious
o
great
drinkable
lager
more
flavor
then
your
run
of
the
mill
domestic
lager
but
still
very
accessible
to
noncraft
beer
drinkers
add
that
it
is
comes
in
a
can
and
is
3

abv
and
this
is
a
perfect
poolbeach
beer

hazy

with
a
foamy
offwhite

settles
to
a
partial
film
on

of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the

down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus

and

aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
grass
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
but
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
tasty
for
what
it
is
overall
this
is
an
okay
american
lager
the
sankaty
light
lager
is
a
decent
american
style
lager
the
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
clear
color
with
white
head
that
is
leaving
some
lace
there
isnt
much
to
the
scent
maybe
some
wet
grain
and
mild
malt
the
taste
is
well
balance
with
subtle
hint
of
lemony
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
lager
and
would
be
best
drank
on
warm
summer
days
overall
really
hoppy
and
light
is
this
right
nice
hop
profile
and
simplistic
o
very
simple
and
straightforward
just
a
clean
hoppy
session
lager
a
nofrills
just
drink
it
sort
of
beer
a
nice
lawnmower
beer
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
o
combine
all
of
the
above
with
a
3
7
abv
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
12pack
over
the
course
of
a
hot
weekend
i
wish
i
could
but
the
price
tag
is
a
little
steep
to
allow
for
this
on
a
regular
basis
very
enjoyable
but
since
i
normally
limit
myself
to
a
beer
a
night
this
one
doesnt
really
fit
into
my
regular
rotation
had
this
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
my
ratings
are
in
comparison
to
other
light
lagers
not
beers
in
general
i
think
that
this
is
how
most
reviews
on
this
site
are
supposed
to
be
but
its
easy
to
compare
lagers
to
other
lagers
when
youve
had
a
bunch
of
different
varieties
as
opposed
to
comparing
something
like
milk
stouts
where
maybe
youve
only
had
a
handful
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
few
light
lagers
that
i
actually
enjoy
drinking
very
refreshing
and
not
too
heavy
crisp
and
fruity
excellent
on
a
summer
day
smell
is
bolder
and
fruitier
than
most
lagers
as
well
solid
offering
from
the
incredibly
consistent
cisco
sankaty
light
is
a
light
beer
that
would
make
coors
light
cringe
not
coors
light
drinkers
mind
you
i
bet
theyd
prefer
it
it
offers
big
flavour
in
a
lowcalorie
serving
and
a
level
of
quality
that
you
simply
cant
find
in
macro
commercial
brands
it
is
a
reminder
that
lower
alcohol
beers
are
still
real
beers
nonetheless
they
have
maltiness
and
bitterness
just
like
any
others
good
on
cisco
for
sticking
up
for
the
little
guys
clean
and
refreshing
nice
lager
overall
a
good
light
lager
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
its
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
watery
and
thin
feel
to
be
expected
i
guess
clean
and
malty
with
some
expressive
noble
hop
character
wisps
of
bready
biscuit
and
herbal
tea
little
sweetness
more
of
a
dry
coarse
finish
not
a
bad
lager
certainly
has
more
flavor
than
most
light
beers
on
the
market
overall
aroma
and
appearance
are
appropriate
to
style
but
the
flavor
was
slightly
watery
and
could
have
benefited
from
a
more
dextrinious
wort
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
crisp
yellowgold

with
a
tall

and
roasted

on

crisp

this
is
a
great

beer

for

drinkable

slight
sheets
of

mild
aromas
of
doughy
malt
grassy

and
sweet

not
bad
for
a
light
beer
taste
is
similarly
impressive
with
more
bready
malt
sweet
toasted
grain
and
faintly
herbal
hops
not
watereddown
in
the
least
and
easily
the
most
fullflavored
light

ive
had
edging
sam

only
slightly
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
drinkable
with
a
mediumthin
body
and
excellent
carbonation
overall
a
superb
light
lager
probably
the
best
on
the
shelves
the
crack
gllug
was
up
to
spec
and
i
managed
to
produce
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
limited
retention
in
this
oppressive
heat
and
humidity
color
was
a
beautiful
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
plenty
of
fizzy
bubbles
take
that
greg
koch
nose
smelled
like
allmalt
no
adjuncts
and
grassy
hops
and
my
heart
began
to
go
pittypat
i
cannot
tell
you
the
pain
that
i
have
endured
at
times
in
this
madness
and
especially
from
this
style
aals
and
amls
this
actually
smelled
like
real
beer
even
in
a
light
lager
version
mouthfeel
was
actually
pretty
big
very
foamy
with
big
bubbles
and
the
taste
was
of
light
malt
and
light
grassy
hops
zounds
finish
was
semidry
and
i
was
ready
for
another
sip
i
cannot
remember
the
last
time
that
i
thought
that
way
of
a
beer
of
this
style
now
all
of
that
said
i
am
not
going
to
pack
the
cooler
full
of
such
cans
however
i
do
not
care
how
good
it
may
be
i
am
not
into
light
beers
i
probably
could
stand
to
lose
some
weight
but
not
by
cutting
back
on
flavorful
beer
if
you
are
accompanying
me
to
the
beach
or
elsewhere
i
will
happily
put
some
in
the
cooler
for
you
but
thats
it
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
grains
taste
is
crisp
malts
a
touch
of
hops
more
flavor
than
just
about
any
light
lagers
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
cut
above
for
this
style
o
very
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
the
low
abv
makes
this
beer
very
sessionable
and
the
lighter
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
this
a
great
summer
beer
to
me
this
beer
basically
sucked
as
a
beer
experience
as
i
dont
see
the
point
of
a
microbrewery
creating
competition
for
coors
light
bud
light
and
amstel
light
this
was
on
par
with
a
macro
brewed
light
beer
and
while
the
flavor
was
above
average
i
just
dont
understand
why
this
beer
exists
if
you
like
this
style
then
go
for
a
budweiser
or
another
beer
that
you
can
find
in
a
711
or
any
gas
station
across
america
this
may
seem
like
a
harsh
review
but
it
based
on
principal
more
than
flavor
perhaps
this
is
helping
cisco
fund
its
other
beers
as
thats
the
only
reason
i
can
think
of
for
producing
this
drink
while
my
score
isnt
that
high
it
just
comes
down
to
reviewing
to
style
in
this
case
still
this
isnt
not
bad
at
all
the
body
is
nice
and
light
with
good
carbonation
i
cant
help
to
compare
this
to
the
big
boys
yes
this
is
a
light
lager
but
theres
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
flavor
to
it
not
a
world
class
beer
but
one
im
sure
ill
enjoy
around
campfires
in
the
summer
tastes
like
the
smell
but
with
a
good
dose
of
bittering
hop
more
grainy
than
i
like
the
body
is
rich
for
the
stylecarbonation
is
low
one
of
the
best
light
beers
ive
ever
had
but
its
still
a
light
beer
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
in
sconset
during
an
unexpected
and
much
needed
weekend
of
relaxation
with
close
friends
lightly
sweet
grainy
nose
with
subtle
noble
hopping
the
grain
flavors
are
rather
husky
almost
a
bit
stale
but
it
ends
up
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
a
very
dry
finish
pretty
refreshing
actually
the
attenuation
seems
to
be
key
here
a
tangier
hop
presence
than
you
might
expect
and
a
much
tastier
experience
than
your
average
light
lager
delivers
this
was
a
surprisingly
flavorful
and
very
quaffable
light
lager
and
seems
like
it
would
make
a
super
sessionable
selection
for
the
spring
and
summer
months
this
beer
was
a
great
choice

put

was

the

it

me
want
to
keep
drinking
it
to
stop
the
dryness
d
not
impressed
in
the
least
one
of
the
worst
craft
beers
ive
tried
i
never
thought
id
drink
something
this
poor
from
cisco
which
has
become
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
new
england
in
just
a
couple
years
this
is
bad
though
enough
to
turn
me
away
from
the
brewery
as
a
whole
for
quite
a
while
theres
no
reason
a
brewery
of
this
quality
should
produce
a
beer
this
bad
this
is
a
light
beer
wow
im
pleasantly
surprised
blows
away
most
micro
lights
including
the
much
touted
sam
adams
light
id
buy
a
case
of
this
as
a
summer
brew
i
highly
recommend
this
and
at
3
8
percent
abv
its
highly
sessionable
o
this
tastes
okay
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
o
very
drinkable
overall
and
sadly
have
never
seen
this
in
the
pittsburgh
area
and
so
thanks
to
okey
for
bringing
this
one
to
my
attention
i
received
a
biker
pour
so
only
ended
up
with
a
thin
skim
of
whitish
bubbles
topping
my
pale
gold
beer
it
had
a
bit
of
haze
and
the
head
left
some
fine
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
it
had
a
grainy
cereal
flavour
fairly
sweet
with
mild
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
toasted
malts
it
was
also
slightly
fruity
and
there
was
slight
citrus
to
the
flavour
and
aroma
the
nose
had
a
grassy
fruity
quality
with
fresh
grain
character
and
hints
of
spice
light
bodied
but
not
thin
medium
to
high
carbonation
offdry
decent
texture
this
was
decent
for
a
light
beer
much
more
flavour
than
you
get
from
a
typical
bmc
light
beer
it
may
have
helped
that
this
tasted
really
fresh
as
well
sampled
on
may
29
2011
it
has
a
straw
yellow
pour
with
a
bit
of
a
fizzy
white
head
that
settles
down
in
typical
light
lager
fashion
lots
of
sweet
malts
corn
and
grain
on
the
nose
the
body
is
better
than
many
lights
the
taste
has
this
vague
bitterness
with
a
weird
mixture
of
sweetness
and
grains
a
decent
enough
light
lager
i
suppose
it
is
pretty
nice
for
a
light
lager
the
plastic
hint
offflavor
bothers
me
at
first
but
it
seems
to
fade
with
time
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
quaff
because
it
isnt
very
filling
and
has
a
low
amount
of
alcohol
thinner
in
flavor
but
watery
flavors
continue
throughout
the
drinking
process
it
is
ok
and
very
different
from
others
in
the
style
pizza
beer
maybe
grilling
beer
but
that
is
about
it
not
bad
but
why
go
here
buy
a
single
not
a
4
pack6pack
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
were
not
overwhelming
and
neither
was
the
alcohol
the
flavors
mixed
well
and
it
was
a
decent
light
lager
pours
a
not
quite
clear
golden
color
just
over
a
one
finger
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
cover
over
the
beer
and
a
fair
amount
of
lace
smells
like
a
pilner
and
has
a
better
taste
than
any
light
beer
i
have
tried
but
did
leave
a
little
after
taste
light
body
which
i
expected
and
carbonation
was
good
easy
to
drink
and
on
the
dry
side
but
a
little
high
priced
at
10
99
for
a
light
beer
ordered
a
pint
at
pour
judgment
in
newport
out
of
curiosity
man
i
was
disappointed
this
beer
was
all
ringwood
character
with
a
bit
of
diacetyl
and
oxidation
there
was
a
mild
bitter
kick
but
this
beer
was
also
a
touch
acidic
and
without
much
actual
malt
character
id
avoid
this
in
the
future
in
summary
id
be
willing
to
buy
the
brand
again
but
not
at
an
11
price
tag
when
a
brand
like
prima
pils
can
be
purchased
at
a
lower
price
the
romance
associated
with
a
connection
to
the
glamour
of
the
nantucket
name
doesnt
automatically
command
a
higher
price
unless
the
product
is
a
superior
one
looks
good
smells
like
feet
tastes
like
fish
nice
and
fizzy
tastes
like
socks
i
give
up
on
cisco
either
their
beer
erupts
uncontrollably
from
the
bottle
is
overhopped
is
overyeasted
or
tastes
like
fish
that
have
rotted
in
somebodys
running
shoes
with
all
that
money
on
nantucket
youd
think
they
could
produce
a
decent
beer
feh

give
an
average
rating
to
this
one
but
i
see
where
theyre
going
with
it
i
likes
it
better
as
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
in
fact
still
though
the
only
thing
light
about
the
beer
is
the
feel
which
is
fine
but
the
flavor
is
quite
strong
and
maybe
too
bitter
for
such
a
light
feel
strong
taste
of
salt
air
and
steamed
clams
and
im
actually
not
just
saying
that
because
its
brewed
in
nantucket
it
really
tastes
that
way
probably
would
be
delicious
with
steamers
but
i
dont
have
any
to
hand
drinkability
if
i
was
at
a
bbq
and
was
planning
on
drinking
a
few
i
would
gladly
consume
a
few
of
these
very
drinkablenice
beer
on
tap
the
the
corner
tavern
in
boston
served
in
a
sharp
looking
glass
looked
to
be
more
than
a
pint
thin
white
head
slight
peppery
smell
overall
nice
flavor
not
very
hoppy
but
with
enough
malt
to
satisfy
i
found
it
to
a
bit
thin
but
since
its
a
light
beer
i
would
assume
such
very
low
abv
made
this
brew
extremely
easy
to
drink
could
easily
be
a
nice
session
beer
one
of
the
better
light
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
d
easy
to
drink
with
some
character
accessible
but
basic
a
good
bbq
beer
or
for
sporting
events
in
the
hot
summer
sun
an
easy
crossover
beer
for
friends
who
drink
macros
the
appearance
is
a
yellow
tone
with
a
two
finger
sized
white
head
it
had
a
smell
of
yeast
and
light
sweetness
the
taste
was
light
and
easy
nice
to
go
along
with
the
warmer
spring
weather
here
in
new
england
mouthfeel
is
basic
not
complex
but
solid
for
the
style
due
to
abv
and
consistency
it
would
work
well
as
a
session
beer
beer
was
served
a
darker
hazy
straw
color
with
a
filmy
white
head
decent
head
retention
and
a
slight
bit
of
lacing
there
wasnt
much
to
the
nose
other
yeast
perhaps
some
slight
hops
but
i
really
had
to
look
for
it
taste
is
definitely
heavy
on
the
yeast
there
was
a
biscuity
flavoring
to
the
beer
though
on
the
finish
you
could
pick
up
some
hops
light
on
the
tongue
decent
carbonation
it
goes
down
easily
though
i
felt
this
beer
fell
a
little
flat
notes
from
31707
this
is
a
really
good
light
beer
the
color
is
light
but
not
as
light
as
a
bud
just
more
amber
than
golden
there
is
not
much
of
a
scent
to
it
what
really
counts
is
the
taste
which
is
very
good
and
the
fair
amount
of
carbonation
makes
the
beer
feel
tight
and
refreshing
the
combination
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
served
in
a
standard
pint
this
one
was
a
gusher
glass
was
98
foam
2
beer
four
inch
bright
white
volcanic
head
that
formed
lots
of
jagged
peaks
and
crags
as
the
eruption
slowly
subsided
lots
of
sticky
lacing
on
this
one
brew
is
a
translucent
goldenyellow
nose
is
clean
and
mild
only
a
faint
wheat
scent
is
detectable
taste
is
also
clean
more
light
wheat
with
a
nice
wellrounded
balance
of
citrus
and
hops
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
nicely
balanced
between
body
and
carbonation
when
served
in
my
pint
however
a
pull
straight
from
the
bottle
revealed
way
too
much
carbonation
good
drinkability
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
for
a
3
8
abv
expected
a
light
lager
but
wow
it
was
a
nice
thick
lager
great
thick
head
that
stuck
nice
aroma
extra
flavs
not
typical
of
a
light
lager
thats
for
sure
thick
pour
for
a
lager
too
refreshing
and
delicious
when
i
was
expecting
mediocrity
i
may
have
found
a
new
favorite
lager
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
rapidly
diminishing
soapy
white
head
clingy
lacing
left
in
the

smell
is
clean
malty
slightly
bready
some
citric
hops
taste
is
crisp
grainy
faint
lemon
rind
mildly
bitter
hop
presence
really
crisp
and
refreshing
but
does
not
skimp
on
flavor
this
is
a
light
beer
cant
believe
i
ignored
this
one
for
so
long
considering
how
much
cisco
ive
drank
these
last
couple
years
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
here
3
80
love
it
this
summery
offering
poured
a
yellowish
amber
with
a
fair
white
head
and
good
lacing
it
smells
like
wonder
bread
and
it
sort
of
tastes
like
white
bread
with
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
a
little
peppery
nice
for
a
light
beer
refreshing
and
not
too
watery
very
easy
drinking
of
course
better
than
most
any
light
beer
i
would
say
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
if
i
was
looking
for
flavor
d
very
smooth
drinkability
and
nice
flavor
would
make
a
good
lawnmower
beer
though
flavor
is
nothing
outstanding
it
still
good
for
what
it
is
poured
a
light
amber
a
bit
clouded
and
with
a
good
head
to
it
definitely
had
strong
citrus
undertones
im
not
a
big
fan
of
white
beers
but
this
seemed
pretty
balanced
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
harpoons
ufo
this
beer
was
nice

id
buy
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
hunting
for
it
ill
try
it
as
a
summer
beer
next
time
pours
a
clouded
gold
with
no
head
nose
is
subdued
citrus
with
a
grain
quality
to
it
there
isnt
much
to
the
nose
though
it
is
rather
light
flavor
is
a
slight
bit
hoppy
and
a
fair
bit
earthy
overall
kind
of
toned
down
from
something
that
seems
like
it
could
be
a
whole
lot
more
feel
is
standard
stuff
overall
it
is
drinkable
sure
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
overly
interesting
and
definitely
not
worth
the
price
nice
but
not
worth
walking
more
than
seven
feet
out
of
your
way
for
overall
a
very
pleasent
lager
a
good
sitting
at
the
bar
during
the
summer
beer
i
also
have
this
in
my
fridge
at
home
and
its
nice
to
have
on
a
warm
work
night
watching
the
game
pours
and
tastes
just
as
good
from
the
bottle
as
it
does
from
the
tap
not
easy
to
find
in
its
four
pack
but
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
could
use
a
bit
more
of
a
kick
but
its
perfect
when
you
want
something
light
its
wellworth
drinking
on
a
hot
day
and
youre
not
looking
to
get
too
hammered
drinkability
very
easy
to
suck
this
down
as
it
is
light
and
has
a
mellow
lemony
flavor
for
a
lite
beer
this
is
much
better
than
any
macro
lite
beer
you
may
try
good
to
try
maybe
have
on
draft
prolly
wont
drink
again
because
not
my
pref
style
the
beer
poured
a
slight
hazy
yellowish
straw
color
with
a
clean
white
head
a
light
lace
was
left
down
the
pint
glass
the
inviting
presentation
gives
way
to
an
equally
impressive
taste
this
beer
smells
floral
with
malt
sweetness
there
is
a
nice
pale
malt
smell
mixed
with
some
fruit
and
citrus
you
can
certainly
pick
up
the
hop
under
tones
good
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
rather
light
but
not
watery
it
certainly
has
a
good
balance
of
flavors
nice
pale
malt
balanced
out
with
the
mild
tone
of
hops
the
hops
leave
a
nice
bitter
tone
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
this
is
a
smooth
and
very
drinkable
beer
no
freshness
date
to
be
found
on
the
bottle
but
it
tasted
perfect
this
one
is
a
very
easy
drinking
session
brew
i
am
glad
i
found
this
one
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
enjoying
more

products

mild
honey
and

aroma
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
taste
is
light
and
lemony
hopped
but
not
overly
so
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
nice
alternative
to
macro
if
its
available
good
drinkability
might
be
a
little
better
in
the
summer
months
not
lagerlike
though
this
beer
may
come
the
worlds
smallest

handle
the
darkest
light
beer
when
it
comes
to
a
rich
amber
color
much
better
than
sam
light
a
well
balanced
from
nantucket
incredibly
drinkable
since
it
came
out
of
a
tap
im
not
sure
how
light
it
is
for
calorie
crunchers
refreshing
and
perfect
for
summer
overall
a
very
drinkable
blonde
ale
light
and
refreshing

excellent
summer
beer
clean
crisp
very
flavorful

for
a
12
oz
bottle
from
capital
convenience
concord
nh
a
cloudy
goldenstraw
color
with
an
agreeable
frothy
head
describes
the
appearance
of
this
brew
theres
a
rustic
malt
and
yeast
smell
thats
framed
by
a
mild
floral
hoppiness
also
present
is
a
faint
citric
grapefruit
aroma
in
all
the
smells
pretty
agreeable
its
just
a
little
faint
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
a
nice
malt
foundation
hops
take
over
by
the
finish
though
which
is
solidly
bitter
and
dry
despite
being
a
lightbodied
brew
this
one
has
a
creamy
texture
to
the
mouthfeel
it
doesnt
have
the
clean
taste
that
i
expected
given
the
style
description
but
its
a
very
agreeable
beer
very
nice
flavor
and
well
balanced
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
expected
that
i
would
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
and
a
ton
of
yeast
floaties
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
that
seems
a
bit
earthy
maybe
the
yeast
along
with
a
mild
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
flavor
that
is
overpowered
with
citrus
hops
it
goes
down
slow
because
of
its
bitterness
and
finishes
dry
and
a
bit
earthy
i
like
the
use
of
hops
but
i
think
this
is
a
little
too
much
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
an
average
beer
at
best
please
leave
the
light
lagers
for
the
big
three
this
is
one
for
the
scrap
heap
bought
this
as
a
single
due
to
the
previous
review
it
pours
an
off
golden
color
a
little
cloudy
small
to
no
head
consistent
with
lighter
beers
it
smelled
like
a
domstic
light
beer
to
me
but
after
sampling
it
had
more
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
i
thought
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
ok
has
a
very
faint
taste
a
bit
fruity
with
a
tad
of
a
bitter
afterataste
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
lighter
beers
so
this
beer
was
just
ok
to
medicore
as
the
previous
reviewer
stated
it
does
taste
a
bit
towards
the
sam
light
spectrum
a
light
grainy
malt
aroma
solid
pale
yellow
but
with
a
slight
haze
a
quick
bubbly
white
head
but
doesnt
last
long
taste
is
slight
grain
and
lemon
zestiness
in
background
has
a
light
tart
finish
that
is
refreshing
great
summer
brew
light
beer
is
a
light
beer
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
earth
shattering
but
its
a
well
made
lager
a
very
good
example
of
a
style
most
of
us
dont
care
for
is
still
a
very
good
beer
not
a
great
beer
but
a
very
good
one
i
really
hate
to
write
this
truly
i
do
because
this
is
an
outstanding
brewery
that
has
produced
dozens
of
beers
that
i
have
absolutely
adored
but
this
was
not
one
of
them
i
found
it
nearly
tasteless
fizzy
water
with
a
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
which
didnt
work
because
it
had
nothing
to
balance
it
out
if
their
goal
was
to
brew
a
light
american
style
lager
that
tasted
like
the
ones
that
the
macro
guys
make
they
nailed
it
like
the
aroma
the
taste
leans
more
to
the
grainy
side
with
a
mild
hop
finish
it
was
not
bad
all
in
all
i
guess
if
you
like
thin
4
5
abv
beers
youll
be
okay
many
others
brew
it
worse
since
im
an
imperial
drinker
im
probably
way
too
harsh
try
it
you
wont
dump
it
just
lower
your
expectations
if
youre
used
to
their
better
brews
serves
up
a
light
yellow
body
and
a
nice
foamy
head
smells
of
minerals
malt
and
some
hops
flowers
very
american
lagery
low
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
certainly
best
served
cold
i
had
mine
slightly
warmer
and
didnt
really
like
it
had
it
on
the
cold
side
and
found
it
refreshing
this
has
a
definite
american
lager
flavor
to
it
so
dont
expect
something
similar
to
what
the
brewery
typically
puts
out
pale
yellow
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
a
shortlived
cap
of
bright
white
soapy
bubbles
malt
and
cereal
aroma
notes
of
herbal
and
slightly
sulfury
hops
moderate
bitterness
that
lingered
slight
citrus
up
front
followed
by
malt
and
grassy
character
pretty
nice
lighttomedium
bodied
carbonation
a
little
on
the
low
side
some
dryness
overall
refreshing
and
nicely
balanced
i
liked
it
and
am
happy
to
have
the
rest
of
a
12pack
to
go
through
o
not
a
super
complex
brew
by
any
measure
but
very
well
done
for
what
it
is
id
be
curious
to
try
this
side
by
side
with
jabby
brau
as
this
seems
very
similar
but
with
a
reduced
hop
presence
overall
typical
jacks
abbey
another
solid
and
clean
lager
even
though
it
is
a
light
beer
it
is
still
a
bit
heavier
than
most
in
the
style
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
o
again
i
like
it
a
lot
overall
meh
not
one
of
their
best
imo
it
has
some
decent
big
doughy
cracker
straw
like
grains
mostly
on
the
taste
hops
are
a
bit
on
the
too
light
side
even
for
a
light
lager
the
lagering
portion
also
seems
a
bit
off
as
it
has
that
mild
minerality
note
not
quite
like
a
sulfur
or
phosphorus
but
something
there
doesnt
quite
seem
up
to
a
typical
jacks
abby
lager
of
particular
note
though
it
doesnt
influence
my
scoring
is
that
this
beer
costs
about
11
a
12pk
this
is
basically
a
gateway
beer
from
bmc
to
craft
but
unlike
other
such
beers
this
one
isnt
really
trying
to
push
you
toward
anything
else
hard
to
find
fault
with
this
and
easy
to
imagine
putting
away
quite
a
bit
of
it
o
it
is
what
it
is
jacks
abbys
answer
to
fizzy
lite
lagers
in
that
light
its
actually
pretty
good
just
dont
expect
anything
on
the
level
of
hoponious
union
this
is
all
about
being
a
12pk
pounder
its
a
bold
decision
for
them
especially
to
go
to
market
with
volume
in
a
12pk
format
this
is
a
brewery
that
had
still
been
bottling
500ml
exclusively
not
even
a
year
ago
i
think
they
timed
it
perfectly
though
they
seem
to
be
at
a
point
where
they
can
comfortably
field
the
volume
as
long
as
demand
doesnt
soar
the
red
white
and
blue
packaging
will
surely
encourage
some
impulse
buys
and
make
for
great
display
pieces
as
it
goes
to
market
around
the
fourth
of
july
next
up
mix
12
pack
might
not
be
a
bad
choice
o
overall
a
solid
lager
shows
was
a
lite
bmc
could
really
taste
like
well
crafted
beer
from
jacks
abby
as
usual
opretty
well
done
a
high
quality
american
lager
that
is
well
made
but
goes
nowhere
the
pushing
any
boundaries
pretty
neat
through
and
through
on
tap
at
the
jacks
abby
brewery
very
tasty
american
style
lager
for
the
price
its
brewed
with
all
real
ingredients
this
means
no
corn
rice
or
other
adjuncts
good
beer
for
drinking
at
bbqs
or
on
the
beach
makes
sense
that
they
would
brew
an
approachable
lager
considering
it
was
brewed
to
raise
money
for
the
revitalization
of
downtown
framingham
yeah
about
this
beer
mass
brewed
says
it
all
for
a
light
beer
this
one
at
least
has
taste
for
its
style
it
is
good
nice
for
a
hot
day
michelob
light
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
with
an
abv
of
4
3
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
grains
and
malts
there
is
a
hit
of
hops
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
light
but
is
bold
with
flavor
michelob
light
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
rich
and
smooth
i
really
like
the
taste
of
this
light
brew
michelob
light
has
flavor
for
being
a
light
beer
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
overall
im
giving
michelob
light
a
4
5
out
of
5
michelob
light
is
not
a
bad
light
beer
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
favorite
light
beer
light
refreshing
while
still
maintaining
a
good
malt
profile
looks
great
but
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
very
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
at
the
cabot
lodge
happy
hour
not
as
bad
as
youd
think
overall
3
69
as
i
sit
here
with
a
golden
light
and
a
regular
light
next
to
each
other
i
stopped
my
review
and
pulled
a
mgl
from
the
fridge
the
michelob
light
tastes
much
better
and
has
better
flavor
where
the
golden
light
has
grassy
straw
and
corn
michelob
light
has
rice
barley
and
faint
hop
its
not
as
easy
drinking
or
unoffensive
as
michelob
golden
light
nor
is
it
near
as
cheap
but
i
have
to
say
the
regular
light
is
the
superior
beer
pours
a
lighter
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
settles
just
to
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
little
spotty
lacing
is
seen
but
not
much
really
the
aroma
isnt
much
just
of
some
grassy
grain
for
the
most
part
with
a
hint
of
sweet
corn
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
slight
sweet
finish
much
more
flavor
and
tastes
better
than
their
more
popular
michelob
ultra
which
i
didnt
care
much
for
medium
carbonation
overall
not
bad
and
close
to
the
flavor
from
20
years
ago
that
i
remember
oif
you
grade
this
beer
on
on
what
it
has
compared
to
what
it
is
suppose
to
be
then
it
was
better
than
most
o
not
flavorful
at
all
goes
down
easily
and
not
too
filling
since
there
isnt
much
to
the
beer
very
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
even
for
a
light
beer
this
one
isnt
very
good
this
beer
is
pretty
awful
i
had
one
and
immediately
went
back
to
regular
michelob
water
doesnt
begin
to
describe
it
no
no
no
overall
this
was
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
its
what
my
dad
drinks
and
i
stole
one
out
of
curiosity
its
definitely
not
something
ill
purchase
on
my
own
dollar
but
it
was
pleasantly
surprising
which
is
of
course
relative
in
the
world
of
american
light
beer
overall
higher
in
sweetness
but
lower
in
refreshment
for
a
beer
of
the
light
category
a
little
too
much
corn
and
papery
taste
combined
with
the
off
feel
make
this
brew
one
to
likely
avoid
overall
a
bit
disappointing
compared
to
the
michelob
ultra
this
is
a
bit
weaker
the
ultra
had
a
bit
more
beer
flavor
and
appearance
this
was
really
low
flavor
and
did
not
make
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
the
taste
is
fresh
with
grains
and
a
crisp
quick
light
hop
finish
it
is
really
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
so
i
would
call
it
average
for
the
style
nothing
crafty
here
just
plain
old
thirst
quenching
stuff
i
think
this
beer
has
an
above
average
taste
that
doesnt
bite
but
is
full
bodied
and
flavorable
i
perfer
a
glass
bottle
over
the
can
or
tap
to
me
it
is
a
much
richer
beer
than
its
brouther
ultra
that
taste
much
closer
to
water
my
only
problem
is
it
seems
that
michelob
light
is
fading
out
of
the
picture
i
am
having
difficulty
finding
my
favorite
beer
in
the
market
place
i
guess
that
is
why
this
is
known
as
dads
beer
but
the
yuppie
beer
ultra
just
doest
measure
up
for
me
well
this
achieved
what
they
set
out
to
achieve
its
light
bodied
very
lightly
flavored
and
you
can
work
through
quite
a
few
of
them
its
unoffensive
highly
drinkable
but
ultimately
forgettable
overall
this
is
a
light
beer
one
rung
higher
than
the
usual
bmc
light
offerings
rated
within
the
style
it
rates
fairly
respectable
i
cannot
believe
that
this
beer
is
not
as
popular
as
other
light
american
beers
its
much
better
than
bud
light
coors
light
and
miller
light
super
drinkable
real
malt
and
hop
flavor
and
some
lacing
make
this
light
lager
my
go
to
light
beer
dont
waste
your
time
with
michelob
ultra
michelob
light
is
much
better
o
its
good
for
one
thing
when
for
whatever
reason
youre
pounding
beers
like
a
madman
and
dont
want
to
seem
as
hoi
polloi
as
the
typically
redneck
bud
light
drinkers
thats
it
people
i
drink
this
stuff
so
you
dont
have
to
so
just
get
some
real
beer
instead
might
i
suggest
some
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
im
not
sure
why
but
this
is
my
favorite
bud
product
it
doesnt
taste
offensive
actually
quite
smooth
with
very
little
intense
flavors
or
hops
appears
a
little
darker
than
normal
light
lagers
but
that
seems
to
be
a
good
thing
not
a
beer
for
playing
drinking
games
but
i
more
closely
relate
this
as
your
dads
beer
not
complex
but
gets
the
job
done
free
beer
rule
applies
here
pours
to
a
thick
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
no
lacing
pale
yellow
aroma
is
a
weak
combo
of
co2
faint
hops
grains
and
a
whiff
of
decomposed
veggies
flavor
is
weak
and
blandyou
can
taste
the
malt
and
hops
and
know
that
they
are
good
but
they
are
just
too
faint
to
enjoy
mouthfeel
is
overcarbonated
but
not
exactly
watery
either
overall
a
waste
of
money
and
space
in
the
fridge
so
why
bother
really
not
a
bad
light
beer
actually
tastes
like
something
at
least
much
better
than
budcoorsbusch
light
o
wasnt
expecting
much
and
it
was
drinkable
not
terrible
for
what
it
is
not
a
good
beer
not
a
bad
beer
rather
unmemorable
which
isnt
a
good
thing
clear
and
yellow
with
a
white
head
and
collarsmell
was
corn
rice
and
bread
and
malts
had
a
sweet
corn
and
malt
start
a
little
hop
taste
with
bread
and
grain
finish
crisp
and
carbonated
easy
to
drink
it
went
well
with
the
wings
not
a
failure
but
an
average
beer
that
is
really
not
to
bad
on
a
100
degree
day
pours
between
a
pale
straw
color
and
water
with
much
carbonation
and
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
stale
hops
and
skunk
on
the
nose
not
much
in
the
flavor
department
other
than
what
was
received
in
the
nose
light
thin
and
watery
goes
down
easy
to
be
avoided
every
time
i
review
a
bmc
product
i
really
try
to
look
deep
for
the
good
qualities
and
rate
it
for
what
it
is
unfortunately
even
for
a
light
beer
this
stuff
is
not
good
the
only
good
side
is
that
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
would
you
really
want
to
sorry
ab
you
have
failed
once
again
o
a
decent
light
lager
i
guess
nothing
remarkable
and
generally
light
in
every
regard
in
that
sense
mission
accomplished
rjt
it
is
not
too
bad
in
the
looks
department
it
has
a
nice
white
head
and
spread
out
lace
the
body
is
a
pale
straw
gold
color
the
aroma
is
faint
but
what
is
there
does
smell
corny
the
body
is
watery
with
some
carbonation
tickle
this
beer
has
a
very
light
american
pilsner
taste
it
is
a
little
bit
sweet
corny
and
with
a
faint
saaz
tone
for
a
light
beer
it
is
not
too
bad
i
used
to
drink
michelob
light
in
my
college
days
the
cockpit
in
5points
columbia
sc
i
drank
it
mainly
because
it
was
their
cheap
beer
the
unique
bottle
it
came
in
and
the
price
were
the
best
things
about
it
dont
get
me
wrong
michelob
aint
bad
its
just
an
average
american
beer
from
one
of
the
big
boxes
i
honestly
dont
think
i
could
tell
the
difference
in
a
blind
taste
test
between
bud
coors
michelob
or
any
of
the
other
light
american
lagers
its
not
to
say
that
i
dont
like
them
i
mean
if
you
got
some
drinkin
to
do
theyre
a
welcomed
old
friend
my
pallet
has
grown
a
bit
over
the
years
and
if
im
drinkin
beer
for
taste
im
not
going
with
an
american
light
beer
all
of
that
said
michelob
isnt
a
bad
product
if
you
got
one
for
me
ill
gladly
drink
it
drinkability
enjoyed
3
back
to
back
all
poured
into
this
interesting
pilsner
glass
the
drinkability
is
unreal
on
these
as
well
as
they
go
down
easier
than
ever
loving
the
beer
from
saint
louis
lately
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
drinkable
for
even
the
occasional
beer
drinker
this
goes
down
with
little
effort
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
some
carbonation
nice
little
onefinger
white
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
kinda
malty
with
some
funkyness
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
light
body
not
drinkable
this
one
is
just
like
the
rest
of
the
macros
out
there
not
worth
of
buying
again
d
drinkable
like
water
bland
and
boring
as
expected
light
bodied
thin
and
watery
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
drinkability
like
i
said
goes
down
smooth
it
was
what
i
expected
from
a
michelob
light
could
definitely
throw
back
a
few
of
these
at
a
backyard
barbecue
pours
a
thin
yellowish
straw
color
with
a
thick
rocky
white
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
corn
and
some
grain
hops
are
nowhere
to
be
found
tastes
quite
awful
like
corn
on
the
cob
in
a
biscuit
mouthfeel
is
super
thin
and
the
drinkability
is
fairly
decent
for
something
that
tastes
like
horse
piss
the
crack
glug
proceeded
as
usual
with
a
short
moment
of
panic
as
the
creamy
bonewhite
head
began
to
approach
the
lip
of
the
glass
fortunately
i
know
what
to
do
in
such
situations
and
backed
off
of
my
pour
great
head
retention
btw
color
was
a
light
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
light
with
a
citrusy
spiciness
that
was
truly
unexpected
it
was
like
lemon
zest
with
a
mild
biscuitiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
lemony
taste
on
the
tongue
along
with
an
attendant
bite
or
snap
dang
this
is
pretty
good
finish
had
more
of
a
biscuit
taste
but
the
lemon
was
still
there
it
reminded
me
of
archway
lemon
snap
cookies
completely
unexpected
the
only
knock
on
this
was
its
watery
mouthfeel
i
would
bring
this
in
the
cooler
for
those
who
are
into
light
beers
but
i
am
not
a
calorie
counter
plus
i
am
betting
that
this
is
sold
at
the
premium
price
range
and
i
would
not
want
a
case
at
those
prices
what
knob
pays
more
than
1
per

it

so
light
overall
not
a
lot
going
for
this
beer
pale
yellow
with
bland
aroma
little
or
no
head
just
not
a
good
light
offering
from
a
premium
label
michelob
is
not
the
brand
it
was
30
or
more
years
ago
sad
to
say
there
is
not
much
to
this
beer
no
malt
or
hop
presence
at
all
in
my
opinion
save
a
few
if
you
want
to
got
this
route
and
just
have
a
miller
lite
this
is
not
a
premium
light
lager
drinkability
satisfactory
michelob
light
is
an
acceptable
light
lager
that
isnt
entirely
devoid
of
flavor
or
woefully
watery
well
to
start
yeah
its
a
macrocheap
beer
in
a
can
very
similar
to
all
the
other
bud
lightsmiller
litesnatural
lightskeystone
etc
but
i
find
this
one
to
have
a
tad
more
of
a
hop
flavor
even
keeps
its
head
as
you
drink
it
cant
say
that
about
much
of
the
other
ones
and
even
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
showing
it
has
some
substance
to
it
clearly
a
lawnmowerparty
beer
but
its
quite
refreshing
and
a
lot
more
tolerable
and
most
of
the
other
cheap
beers
plus
its
the
same
price
one
of
my
favorite
cheap
beers
d
easy
to
drink
but
unfortunately
not
that
enjoyable
it
is
clear
that
you
have
to
sacrifice
taste
in
order
to
watch
calories
and
michelob
ultra
is
a
good
example
of
this
drinkability
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tried
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
getting
it
again
the
taste
is
of
light
grain
some
malt
sweetness
and
a
decent
hop
bitterness
overall
pretty
flavourful
for
a
light
lager
and
one
of
best
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
i
poured
this
average
bland
brew
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
i
would
not
normally
waste
my
time
rating
a
domestic
beer
but
my
wife
drinks
these
and
said
why
not
so
the
beer
poured
a
nice
blond
color
clear
and
sparkling
the
head
was
white
with
tinly
little
bubbles
that
did
not
last
long
at
all
the
smell
was
breadty
and
yeasty
the
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
for
sure
good
chick
beer
i
would
drink
this
beer
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
taste
is
better
than
expected
for
the
style
and
the
body
actually
has
some
semblance
of
legs
to
stand
on
bit
buttery
even
on
the
finish
with
a
short
lived
malt
close
carbonation
is
good
enough
to
lift
the
beer
a
bit
yet
not
the
pucker
i
got
from
the
ultra
drinkability
is
good
low
abv
low
calories
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
yet
this
easily
outstrips
most
competitors
and
many
a
big
brother
better
than
bmcs
regular
offerings
um
not
sure
what
to
say
about
this
not
much
of
a
beer
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
not
much
in
the
way
of
anything
piss
color
no
nose
very
subtle
candy
malt
flavor
and
thats
about
it
no
real
point
in
drinking
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
beer
get
something
better
yuengling
sam
adams
light
or
cheaper
bmc
no
point
going
here
overall
if
youre
going
to
drink
something
in
this
category
youre
drinking
crap
beer
why
spend
the
extra
money
for
michelob
when
you
can
get
much
the
same
undesirable
traits
from
keystone
or
natty
for
much
less
and
without
much
of
a
difference
in
taste
poor
value
the
next
time
i
pay
for
cheap
american
beer
which
wont
be
for
a
long
while
ill
just
go
for
the
cheap
stuff
somehow
i
find
myself
rating
every
americanstyle
pale
lager
the
same
that
saddens
me
there
is
once
again
no
taste
other
than
water
grains
and
slight
metallic
hop
flavors
doesnt
smell
that
great
the
looks
are
nothing
special
its
a
light
beer
zero
points
for
originality
and
would
not
buy
or
drink
not
as
full
bodied
as
the
regular
but
still
respectable
for
a
lite
not
much
to
the
nose
more
grainy
than
michelob
light
yellow
pour
medium
creamy
white
head
more
filling
than
most
commercial
counterparts
flavor
has
that
typical
watery
weak
malt
affect
pours
a
fivefinger
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
ring
leaving
no
lace
crystal
clear
pale
amber
color
very
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
grassy
nose
flavor
is
sweet
grass
clean
finish
very
one
dimensional
who
drinks
this
stuff
1
75
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
barbs
beer
emporium
concord
nh
d
for
a
light
beer
its
ok
i
am
a
beer
snob
but
for
this
style
of
beer
and
the
fact
that
it
is
a
mass
produced
it
is
better
than
i
expected
one
of
the
best
lights
behind
sam
adams
and
amstel
d
only
if
there
is
no
other
possible
choice
and
im
pretty
resourceful
this
isnt
terrible
but
i
just
dont
see
the
point
for
whatever
reason
i
find
this
one
to
be
even
more
watery
than
a
lot
of
other
light
beer
swill
however
thats
almost
like
saying
aquafina
is
more
watery
than
poland
spring
very
pale
yellow
color
with
some
straw
or
hay
taste
nothing
offensive
just
nothing
really
to
it
d
definitely
one
of
the
better
versions
of
this
style
that
ive
come
across
much
better
than
abs
other
lights
that
i
have
had
bud
light
and
michelob
ultra
soft
and
easy
to
drink
if
it
was
a
couple
dollars
cheaper
id
be
inclined
to
buy
a
sixer
of
it
to
the
craft
beer
drinker
you
really
dont
get
much
but
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
sixer
over
the
course
of
a
hot
summer
day
another
crappy
beer
from
ab
amazing
who
would
have
thunk
it
this
one
was
also
free
at
our
hotel
at
disneylandvery
pale
straw
yellow
that
you
could
see
right
throughlittle
white
head
and
no
lacing
wet
grass
and
grains
with
a
good
whiff
of
corn
is
what
comes
to
the
nosetaste
is
the
same
with
the
corn
coming
thruvery
lite
body
and
bubbly
like
eno
in
waterwent
down
like
waternot
much
for
my
liking
d
very
high
i
could
drink
at
least
a
sixpack
of
these
in
a
sitting
very
smooth
well
balanced
you
get
what
you
expect
here
for
a
macro
brew
you
can
get
it
down
but
not
much
more
enjoyment
than
that
clear
pale
yellow
body
supports
a
decent
white
foamy
head
with
moderate
retentionnot
bad
for
a
light
beer
im
not
impressed
with
the
smell
with
a
faint
malty
aroma
peeking
through
light
grassy
but
nothing
else
ok
taste
a
decent
bit
of
malt
for
a
light
beer
but
on
the
whole
not
impressive
smooth
mouthfeel
with
fairly
good
carbonation
and
duration
assist
mick
light
and
its
far
from
the
worst
light
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
not
a
beer
that
interests
me
that
piques
my
interest
with
some
fairly
well
done
aspect
or
interesting
twist
in
the
slightest
thats
about
what
i
expected
beats
nothing
in
dire
straits
but
falls
far
short
of
actually
good
beer
in
summary
there
are
so
many
other
beers
out
there
with
different
characters
and
more
to
offer
in
terms
of
flavor
character
mouthfeel
etc
i
could
easily
forego
my
daily
beer
ration
if
my
only
choice
was
michelob
light
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
fizzy
white
head
smells
like
grassy
hops
and
pale
malt
the
taste
is
super
light
possibly
a
slight
malt
presence
body
is
soda
like
and
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
i
dont
mind
lagers
with
no
flavor
but
they
probably
shoulnt
give
me
the
bitter
beer
face
not
too
drinkable
due
to
the
bite
oh
well
at
leat
im
not
going
to
get
fat
off
of
this
one
reading
the
commercial
description
made
me
laugh
when
i
saw
superpremium
light
beer
never
knew
there
was
such
a
thing
this
beer
sucks
like
most
american
light
pale
lagers
no
taste
too
much
carbonation
etc
not
really
that
offensive
just
lacking
everything
from
taste
to
aroma
dont
bother
with
this
id
avoid
if
at
all
possible
d
if
youre
into
this
for
the
night
stranded
at
some
nonbeerliterate
party
or
pub
youll
survive
it
insession
i
usually
keep
some
mgb
on
stock
at
home
as
inexpensive
backups
or
for
usmacroonly
fans
this
one
has
less
in
the
flavor
but
overall
makes
a
nicely
reasonable
compromise
for
those
who
know
real
beer
overall
its
much
better
than
miller
lite
bud
light
etc
ill
buy
it
again
when
i
want
something
light
and
simple
like
when
im
with
friends
who
have
no
interest
in
discussing
the
character
of
their
beer
which
is
both
frequent
and
ok
this
beer
is
ok
it
is
like
many
of
the
other
macro
brewed
light
lagers
out
there
it
is
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
short
white
head
the
smell
is
of
very
light
malt
and
very
light
hops
the
taste
is
the
same
very
light
malt
and
very
light
hops
that
are
just
watered
down
the
aftertaste
is
kind
of
dry
and
it
doesnt
really
do
much
for
my
beer
needs
but
that
is
what
these
light
lagers
tend
to
do
not
really
worth
it
even
if
you
are
gonna
rollerblade
on
your
power
lunch
the
good
thing
is
that
it
is
pretty
drinkable
and
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
overall
drinkability
is
very
east
cause
it
is
like
fizzy
water
what
tiny
bit
of
beer
flavor
i
detected
was
not
bad
but
that
kinda
sucks
for
me
cause
i
like
having
flavor
in
my
beer
oh
well
wow
i
havent
killed
a
soldier
in
awhile
this
one
definitely
went
down
the
drain
after
four
sips
thank
god
it
was
free
pours
a
pale
yellow
smells
crisp
light
and
sweet
to
its
credit
i
guess
tastes
awful
like
theres
nothing
but
adjuncts
and
sugar
very
grainy
thin
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
if
it
were
cold
and
stayed
cold
i
could
probably
finish
it
but
this
is
basically
relabeled
bud
light
to
me
d
like
most
beers
in
this
style
they
are
theoretically
fairly
drinkable
but
id
rather
not
drink
beer
d
very
pleasant
much
better
than
your
typical
ab
beer
nothing
impressive
but
one
of
the
best
efforts
ive
seem
from
ab
d
an
easy
drinker
almost
as
easy
as
water
but
no
flavor
whatsoever
while
you
wont
find
utopia
in
a
beer
like
this
you
will
find
a
better
consistency
than
many
other
light
lagers
this
is
pretty
close
to
sam
adams
light
in
my
opinion
as
both
are
allmalt
have
decent
flavors
and
still
considered
to
be
light
beers
i
think
again
that
ab
has
made
a
good
choice
with
the
michelob
line
sans
the
ultra
stuff
this
brew
pours
a
clear
straw
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
lasts
about
a
minute
before
it
recedes
into
this
lacing
this
is
one
of
the
better
looking
light
beers
i
have
seen
the
aroma
is
of
cereal
with
a
touch
of
caramel
but
is
very
faint
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
however
it
does
have
a
somewhat
silky
texture
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
light
beers
i
have
had
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
because
light
beer
isnt
my
thing
however
if
i
were
at
a
party
with
only
macros
to
choose
from
and
if
i
were
in
the
right
mood
i
e
i
really
felt
like
having
a
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
what
can
i
really
say
about
this
looks
bad
smells
like
air
and
tastes
like
flavored
water
at
a
concert
it
is
all
you
can
get
so
its
what
you
are
left
with
pale
yellow
carbonated
water
that
has
to
be
drank
freezing
or
it
is
completly
untolerable
please
look
somewhere
else
its
not
offensive
that
is
unless
you
find
the
lack
of
flavor
to
be
offensive
to
the
name
of
beer
theres
a
low
pale
malt
flavor
masked
by
a
slight
sweetness
and
dustygrain
like
flavor
the
aroma
hints
of
sour
grains
and
the
drinkability
isnt
bad
if
youre
thirtsy
really
though
there
isnt
much
reason
to
try
this
for
a
ab
product
this
isnt
bad
and
for
an
ab
light
beer
this
is
outstanding
when
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
pack
this
isnt
going
to
make
me
swear
off
pilsner
but
if
i
had
to
drink
a
light
beer
this
is
easily
the
best
of
the
bunch
except
for
maybe
sam
adams
light
michelob
light
is
a
brew
i
go
for
when
im
with
friends
and
we
are
picking
out
a
keg
of
light
beer
to
use
at
a
party
for
beer
olympics
and
such
it
pours
clear
and
very
pale
with
alot
of
carbonation
building
the
foamy
bright
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
some
lightly
bready
grains
and
possibly
a
hint
at
noble
hop
the
flavor
is
of
course
light
but
with
more
malt
flavor
than
most
light
beers
in
its
class
some
lightly
sweet
hay
like
grain
and
just
enough
balancing
bitterness
that
is
a
bit
spicy
light
body
and
fairly
carbonated
feel
it
goes
down
with
ease
and
id
choose
it
over
many
other
light
beers
good
bottles
to
this
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
if
you
make
sure
to
drink
it
nice
and
cold
why
would
anyone
drink
this
you
want
a
session
beer
there
are
better
beers
out
there
for
sessioning
you
want
cheap
there
are
better
cheap
beers
out
there
you
want
to
watch
your
weight
try
exercising
once
in
a
while
stop
eating
shit
and
stick
with
the
truly
flavorful
beers
overall
impression
certainly
not
an
exciting
beer
but
i
do
appreciate
seeing
an
all
malt
light
lager
wont
be
seeking
it
out
but
it
seems
like
a
better
trend
than
the
alcopops
and
adjunt
filled
light
lagers
pours
a
light
golden
color
out
of
the
newold
bottle
not
much
of
a
difference
from
the
old
mich
light
but
there
is
a
hint
of
more
maltiness
smells
like
nothing
water
at
the
most
tastes
lacking
to
say
the
least
slight
malt
and
hop
note
but
not
much
of
anything
else
mouthfeel
is
average
drinkability
is
high
just
cause
you
could
drink
it
all
day
long
and
nothing
would
happen
to
you
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
any
other
macro
light
lager
with
a
slightly
stonger
malt
presence
and
more
noticeable
grassy
hops
definitely
decent
as
far
as
this
category
goes
yet
still
nothing
special
i
would
like
to
see
how
the
amber
bock
is
as
all
malt
characteristically
theres
nothing
to
say
except
light
gold
bubbly
and
a
thin
cornlike
sweetness
this
is
better
than
most
other
massprolts
because
a
it
doesnt
have
off
tastes
and
b
you
really
can
drink
a
twelve
and
feel
fine
in
the
morn
very
light
on
taste
but
highly
drinkable
especially
compared
to
others
in
this
style
underrated
here
in
a
close
race
with
lite
for
massprolight
supremacy
example
i
could
bring
a
case
of
this
over
to
my
broinlaws
house
knock
it
off
with
him
during
a
yankee
game
and
feel
no
pain
in
the
morning
allmalt
light
amber
body
just
slightly
darker
hue
than
the
old
one
with
an
inch
of
white
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
quickly
but
leaves
some
lacing
smells
sweet
and
grainy
tastes
sweet
with
bready
and
biscuity
notes
with
a
hint
of
dms
still
the
flavor
is
somewhat
weak
and
watery
light
bodied
but
not
quite
as
watery
as
the
old
one
imo
not
a
great
leap
from
the
old
version
though
it
does
taste
better
and
is
more
palletable
far
and
away
the
best
macro
lager
out
there
now
unless
you
count
sam
adams
imho
at
first
i
might
have
mistaken
this
for
a
pale
lager
as
it
pours
a
surprisingly
good
head
into
my
recently
bought
kronenbourg
1664
glass
faint
smells
of
adjuncts
stop
as
i
tilt
the
glass
into
my
mouth
and
taste
uncle
bens
rice
with
a
small
trace
of
bitterness
a
bit
watery
but
firm
for
a
light
beer
not
a
harsh
beer
to
drink
but
nothing
really
happening
either
i
guess
what
im
trying
to
say
is
its
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
and
thats
with
adjuncts
i
have
to
give
credit
to
ab
here
theyve
brought
mich
light
back
from
swill
into
a
passable
nofrills
creamy
and
thicker
than
expected
leaves
a
bitter
feel
but
actually
not
too
bad
considering
type
relatively
inoffensive
for
a
macro
could
do
a
lot
worse
not
too
bad
for
a
lowertier
brew
not
worth
trying
your
typical
macro
i
got
this
pint
at
prime
time
sports
grill
it
poured
not
head
with
very
fast
retention
and
little
if
any
lace
the
color
was
a
pale
gold
if
that
is
a
color
the
smell
was
typical
macro
the
taste
was
typical
macro
by
typical
macro
i
mean
that
it
was
blah
not
good
but
not
bad
decent
brew
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
not
the
best
light
beer
out
there
just
tastes
like
it
was
over
filtered
or
something
our
fireworks
team
did
a
show
last
night
for
the
local
high
school
when
we
were
returning
the
equipment
to
the
team
directors
barn
around
midnight
he
wandered
down
from
his
house
and
brought
us
a
bottle
of
this
beer
down
as
a
token
of
thanks
for
a
show
that
was
well
received
by
the
football
fans
this
really
hit
the
spot
occasions
like
this
fit
this
style
of
beer
well
every
beer
has
its
place
and
this
one
serves
in
that
aspect
really
well
d
i
wouldnt
regularly
pick
this
up
but
when
it
is
free
and
it
is
the
only
beer
option
it
will
do
the
job
i
suppose
for
mass
produced
light
beer
michelob
light
is
not
really
all
that
bad
when
there
isnt
any
choice
when
being
out
with
friends
at
a
bar
boiling
alley
or
a
ballgame
i
suppose
the
host
of
our
family
reunion
did
okay
when
selecting
this
he
could
have
done
much
worse
anheuserbusch
is
known
the
world
over
for
their
commitment
to
quality
and
it
shows
in
addition
to
bud
light
the
best
selling
light
beer
on
earth
michelob
light
proves
that
they
really
know
how
to
make
a
light
beer
work
whats
the
difference
between
this
and
water
water
doesnt
give
you
a
headache
decent
mouthfeel
and
decent
drinkability
the
smell
is
bland
and
a
little
skunky
i
think
they
need
to
clean
out
their
lines
the
taste
is
nothing
great
at
all
and
is
bitter
stale
hops
and
adjunts
really
is
sad
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
the
largest
brewer
in
the
world
michelob
light
was
served
to
me
with
absolutely
no
head
its
appearance
was
typical
of
macro
lagers
yellow
the
smell
was
typical
as
well
adjunct
tastes
like
corn
fairly
typical
and
nothing
to
particularly
recommend
it
okay
for
lawnmower
beer
frat
parties
and
other
appropriate
occasions
only
d
might
be
nice
with
spicy
food
but
water
will
serve
the
same
purpose
save
your
money
for
a
beer
with
some
flavor
this
one
simply
has
none
drinkability
could
conceivably
drink
about
a
dozen
but
the
question
is
do
i
want
to
the
lack
of
enjoyment
derived
from
this
beer
is
the
biggest
knock
against
its
drinkability
its
one
of
the
palest
beers
ive
ever
had
pours
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
smell
is
all
malt
adjunct
mostly
corn
taste
i
dont
think
it
has
any
tastes
like
a
piece
of
wonder
bread
was
stuck
in
seltzer
water
for
a
while
then
served
as
beer
why
buy
this
when
you
could
get
something
good
or
getting
something
equally
bad
for
half
the
price
im
never
having
this
again
mind
you
the
only
reason
i
paid
any
money
for
this
beer
tonight
was
so
i
could
finish
this
craxz
beer
club
im
in
where
i
get
a
nice
50
gift
certificate
after
completing
my
list
as
you
can
tell
im
near
the
end
not
the
worse
since
its
on
draft
this
beer
is
just
so
nearly
not
as
good
after
ive
reviewed
250
beers
in
the
past
year
or
so
either
your
tastes
really
change
or
the
comparison
is
so
obvious
now
not
worth
even
drinking
after
a
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
day
in
40
degree
weather
its
even
worse
pours
light
yellow
with
a
tinge
of
amber
and
has
a
mediumsized
white
quickly
diminishing
head
only
the
slightest
film
and
light
spotty
lacing
the
smell
is
lightly
floral
and
grainy
the
taste
is
well
for
a
light
macro
not
horrible
crisp
and
light
with
the
slightest
hint
of
nut
its
not
terrible
but
its
just
too
bland
and
watered
down
for
me
to
really
take
much
pleasure
in
drinking
one
of
these
but
it
is
easydrinking
a
beer
from
anheuser
family
the
best
of
all
is
its
bottle
in
elegant
extruded
aluminum
no
comments
about
its
drinkability
little
aromatic
of
hops
adjoincts
rice
over
the
flavor
off
course
good
for
american
and
mexican
cuisine
snack
monday
night
not
try
with
german
cuisine
70
recommended
overall
a
good
try
at
a
light
american
lager
i
tad
better
than
miller
lite
no
doubt
just
cost
more
than
the
latter
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
hanging
out
at
my
brothers
house
before
going
to
the
brewpub
downtown
i
figured
id
try
one
of
his
mich
lights
pale
almost
clear
golden
color
with
a
whisp
of
a
fizzy
head
slightly
sour
aroma
of
cheap
adjunct
malt
palate
actually
has
a
bit
of
flavor
to
it
cheap
malt
and
a
bit
of
smokiness
i
dont
think
you
could
pick
up
any
hop
flavor
with
an
electronic
sniffer
light
body
is
slightly
foamy
not
terrible
but
certainly
not
a
pleasurable
drinking
experience
sample
out
of
one
of
the
fancy
new
aluminum

back
from
a
recent
trip
to
the
states
definatley
a
unique
package
metallic
blue
tall
and
thin
16
oz
after
the
rather
stunning
package
it
is
a
very
basic
bmc
macro
product
pours
out
a
yellow
color
foam
comes
and
goes
leaving
a
glass
of
yellow
colored
water
it
has
a
light
aroma
of
some
grain
or
grass
not
much
taste
again
typical
of
what
you
expect
from
a
light
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
over
carbonated
nothing
special
would
not
search
out
again
based
on
the
taste
but
it
is
a
cool
looking
can
lackluster
and
tasteless
looks
light
yellow
and
brightly
clear
overly
carbonated
and
lacks
head
retention
or
lacing
tastes
low
malty
or
sweet
grainy
and
cornlike
slightly
metalic
and
astringent
tastes
similar
to
smell
hard
on
the
toung
and
palate
because
of
the
carbonation
thin
and
scrubbed
to
the
palate
no
malt
or
hop
flavor
or
balance
to
mention
light
and
powdery
finish
with
a
grainy
metalic
aftertaste
aside
from
all
of
its
poor
qualities
its
not
offensive
but
neither
is
water
all
of
its
beerlike
qualities
disolve
as
soon
as
it
hits
the
palate
appearance
is
that
translucent
pale
straw
we
have
come
to
associate
with
lite
beers
way
too
much
carbonation
diminishes
the
aroma
straw
barley
dextrose
and
not
much
else
and
the
taste
foam
appears
and
disappears
without
leaving
anything
to
remember
them
by
initial
taste
is
of
water
a
hint
of
malt
and
a
soupcon
of
hops
finish
is
nonexistent

the
beer
just
goes
down
your
throat
and
thats
it
not
worth
a
repeat
12
oz
born
on
5205
served
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
pours
a
thin
watery
yellow
that
is
crystal
clear
with
lots
and
lots
of
streams
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
and
a
12
inch
white
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
smell
is
of
adjuncts
and
metal
with
the
same
for
the
flavor
but
with
a
trace
of
hops
very
light
with
your
average
macro
drinkability
michelob
light
is
the
clear
loser
of
macro
smackdown
v
thats
not
to
say
that
miller
high
life
light
is
any
great
shakes
but
this
beer
just
rolled
over
and
quit
flavorwise
a
more
pathetic
showing
i
have
rarely
seen
the
new
canottlebottcan
didnt
do
squat
gosh
and
i
really
expected
it
to
stay
away
from
mich
light
stay
very
very
far
away
sampled
their
new
aluminum
bottle
shaped
can
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
white
head
taste
in
very
light
with
a
background
sweetness
mouth
is
not
unpleasant
and
is
a
good
thirstquencher
a
good
example
of
a
lawnmower
beer
an
easy
drinking
beer
another
us
macro
review
it
is
a
very
typical
bmc
macro
product
it
has
a
light
aroma
and
not
much
taste
but
just
enough
to
make
you
remember
that
youre
drinking
a
macro
the
mouthfeel
is
foamy
and
overall
it
is
another
yellow
fizzy
macro
the
last
time
i
had
a
michelob
it
was
a
regular
one
and
it
was
better
than
its
light
version
not
a
problem
to
find
out
lots
of
better
beers
a
weak
follow
up
to
its
half
decent
full
flavored
brother
not
much
to
speak
of
here
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
but
as
with
most
other
ab
products
it
dissipated
in
less
than
15
seconds
medium
carbonation
and
odors
of
corn
and
malt
were
detected
over
the
slight
aroma
of
alcohol
flavor
was
decent
but
not
anything
great
with
overtones
of
hops
barely
and
corn
finished
slightly
sweet
with
a
kind
of
floral
note
nothing
special
here
they
need
to
go
back
to
the
unique
bottle
then
i
might
buy
this
stuff
once
in
a
while
then
again
maybe
i
wouldnt
then
anyway
poured
from
a
sharp
looking
aluminum
bottle
does
this
count
as
a
bottle
since
it
is
can
material
who
knows
clear
straw
color
barely
any
head
visible
smell
what
smell
barely
grainy
and
i
mean
barely
taste
is
also
lightly
grainy
no
decent
malt
presence
no
hops
to
speak
of
what
a
weak
pos
beer
skip
it
still
one
of
my
favorite
light
beers
if
i
want
an
agreeable
light
beer
that
most
people
can
drink
that
will
still
give
me
some
sence
of
forfillment
this
is
it
much
more
flavor
than
most
other
light
beers
not
as
flavorfull
as
most
lagers
or
sam
adams
light
it
is
still
far
superior
to
the
bud
light
coors
light
genre
or
beers
easy
to
drink
just
like
cold
and
refreshing
carbonated
water
a
typical
fizzy
tasteless
american
macro
light
and
nothing
more
this
stuff
is
not
a
bad
choice
for
getting
loaded
in
the
ice
shanty
or
whereever
it
is
that
you
get
loaded
lots
better
than
bud
light
the
michelobs
should
probably
be
anheuserbuschs
flagship
beer
12oz
bottle
i
cant
believe
that
i
used
to
drink
this
all
the
time
as
for
macro
lagers
go
it
isnt
half
bad
it
doesnt
have
a
very
strong
aroma
but
it
isnt
unpleasant
in
the
least
the
taste
is
about
the
same
there
is
a
bit
of
it
there
but
it
doesnt
offend
on
the
plus
side
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
miss
the
old
bottle
whatever
happened
to
tradition
noble
hop
flavor
wretched
well
wifezilla
was
turning
50
so
i
had
to
supply
some
better
stuff
than
bud
lite
for
her
family
no
way
could
i
get
good
stuff
without
them
complaining
well
the
mic
lite
was
acceptable
its
just
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
flavor
it
pours
ok
with
a
minimal
head
no
aroma
to
speak
of
no
one
got
sick
from
it
so
i
guess
thats
the
highlight
of
this
stuff
very
plae
and
clear
does
form
a
nice
longlasting
head
that
is
quit
respectable
smell
is
very
lacking
so
i
gave
it
a
rockbottom
score
very
light
in
taste
slightly
sweet
with
hops
doing
very
little
as
well
a
little
bitter
leaving
virtually
no
aftertaste
the
beer
has
so
little
taste
that
its
easy
to
drink
but
you
have
to
wonder
why
you
would
want
to
as
light
macros
go
this
one
isnt
horrible
yet
theres
no
reason
to
recommend
it
either
however
if
youre
ever
in
an
allbmc
situation
this
is
one
of
your
better
options
reflection
if
you
have
to
drink
a
light
beer
try
sam
adams
or
amstel
but
if
you
had
any
sense
at
all
you
would
be
drinking
guinness
for
only
a
few
more
calories
have
some
damn
pride
overall
im
surprised
many
dont
like
this
brew
a
lot
i
found
a
lot
of
flavor
in
its
taste
a
nice
refreshing
light
beer
that
is
leaps
and
bounds
above
its
competitors
for
a
good
light
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
ive
had
nonalcoholic
beer
that
taste
better
with
so
many
quality
lagers
available
to
purchase
i
cannot
fathom
why
anyone
would
choose
this
dreck
no
flavor
no
redeeming
qualities
at
all
unless
it
is
icecold
and
you
have
nothing
else
to
drink
the
beer
upon
its
exit
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
limpid
pale
gold
color
with
a
modest
semicreamy
bright
white
head
and
after
its
demise
the
lace
forms
a
velum
like
sheet
on
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
fresh
and
crisp
start
sweet
and
light
grain
profile
top
slender
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
benignly
acidic
the
hops
sparing
in
their
spiciness
quite
dry
aftertaste
ive
had
much
worse
light
beers
than
this
one
but
that
still
is
not
saying
much
it
poured
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
faded
quickly
into
nothingness
the
smell
was
lightly
malty
with
a
dirt
like
smell
to
it
as
well
the
taste
was
a
little
heavier
than
most
light
beers
and
had
a
decent
malt
profile
and
not
much
of
a
grainy
flavor
at
all
decent
mouthfeel
for
a
light
beer
as
well
not
good
enough
to
buy
but
id
drink
it
if
it
were
available
for
free
tasted
061604
pours
an
unattractive
pale
yellow
with
alot
of
bubbles
rishing
through
the
glass
head
isnt
to
bad
but
goes
down
to
a
fizzle
smell
is
of
roasted
corn
and
grain
clean
to
the
nose
taste
is
very
clean
and
fresh
grain
notes
are
the
steady
taste
sweetness
lingers
but
the
hop
pizazz
just
wasnt
there
almost
a
flat
tingle
light
bodied
lager
goes
down
easy
but
so
much
better
out
there
why
settle
for
this
michelob
light
was
an
above
average
light
beer
it
went
down
very
smooth
and
i
enjoyed
it
however
i
was
expecting
more
taste
the
bottle
says
brewed
with
imported
hops
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
this
beer
tasted
very
similar
to
the
less
pricey
michelob
golden
draft
light
sold
here
in
minnesota
it
was
very
easy
to
down
the
12
pack
i
bought
if
you
are
ever
in
minnesota
or
its
border
states
save
some
money
and
buy
mich
gold
light
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
boasts
of
mostly
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
but
is
also
fresh
smelling
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
is
watery
and
weak
with
a
slight
malt
flavor
it
refreshes
on
the
way
down
and
finishes
clean
it
has
a
slight
bitter
skunkiness
but
it
is
very
small
the
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
well
despite
all
of
its
limitations
this
is
the
light
macro
beer
for
me
cheers
from
what
i
could
tell
of
the
color
it
was
in
a
can
after
all
it
was
a
very
pale
yellow
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
produces
a
lot
of
foam
while
cruising
around
in
a
golf
cart
smelled
about
like
what
i
expected
kinda
grainy
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
tasted
better
than
bud
light
i
can
tell
you
that
and
without
the
nasty
headache
didnt
care
much
for
the
flavor
overall
though
it
did
surprise
me
with
just
a
little
hoppy
bite
at
the
end
maybe
a
hint
of
what
it
could
be
were
it
not
produced
for
the
masses
clean
mouthfeel
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
a
bite
kinda
crisp
ill
take
this
over
bud
with
that
being
said
i
wont
drink
this
often
it
is
however
a
work
of
art
when
compared
to
michelob
ultra
final
thoughts
i
consume
a
lot
of
this
product
without
really
thinking
about
it
in
reality
this
is
just
a
mediocre
beer
that
is
over
priced
imo
at
around
56
a
six
pack
better
stuff
can
be
had
in
this
price
range
when
you
think
about
it
ab
touts
the
michelob
line
as
their
high
end
beers
when
they
really
arent
that
big
of
an
upgrade
in
product
but
significantly
higher
in
price
still
ill
probably
keep
buying
it
out
of
habit
this
is
a
very
light
straw
colored
beer
with
some
head
and
no
noticable
aroma
the
taste
is
a
significant
disappointment
there
was
none
but
not
bad
when
compared
to
its
style
competing
against
water
perrier
and
low
cal
tonic
water
mouthfeel
compares
to
that
of
other
watery
drinks
drinkability
is
the
high
point
of
this
alchoholic
substance
due
to
its
lack
of
substantial
consistency
or
flavor
it
could
honestly
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
just
like
water
if
you
consider
yourself
a
lover
of
beer
i
would
steer
clear
of
this
offering
if
you
like
to
drink
heavily
for
the
purpose
of
mass
consumption
and
drunkeness
without
becoming
full
or
consuming
mass
calories
this
is
what
you
need
well
i
never
really
thought
beer
could
taste
like
air
this
one
takes
the
cake
for
that
one
it
had
no
real
distinctive
taste
at
all
really
just
a
small
shot
of
malt
which
was
weak
at
best
the
rest
was
a
heavy
airwater
taste
the
only
real
redeeming
quality
of
this
beer
is
the
apperance
it
had
a
pale
straw
color
with
an
impressive
head
that
lasted
a
little
while
why
is
the
drinkability
so
high
i
could
drink
this
if
i
needed
some
refreshment
after
lifting
or
throwing
if
i
was
an
alcoholic
i
would
substitute
this
for
water
pale
yellow
appearance
with
quickly
dissipating
head
no
aroma
to
speak
of
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
slight
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
a
good
choice
with
food
but
is
not
much
by
itself
this
beer
was
my
gentle
introduction
to
beer
drinking
24
years
ago
it
is
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
12
oz
bottle
very
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
last
for
more
than
15
seconds
or
so
the
smell
is
syrupy
sweet
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
but
not
much
there
very
carbonated
tastes
like
corn
and
has
no
real
body
to
it
at
all
the
aftertaste
just
seems
like
something
fizzy
of
all
the
light
beers
that
i
have
had
this
one
isnt
that
good
even
though
i
really
liked
michelob
and
michelob
ultra
i
really
cannot
say
that
i
liked
this
beer
that
much
at
all
it
has
a
very
watered
down
taste
and
in
reality
doesnt
even
taste
like
beer
to
me
at
all
i
flat
out
just
did
not
enjoy
this
at
all
and
would
not
recommend
it
unless
it
is
the
only
thing
available
all
imported
hops
what
hops
there
might
be
one
or
two
in
here
and
imported
from
where
ive
tossed
imported
mulch
in
my
garden
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
want
my
hops
grown
in
a
peat
bog
a
little
more
information
would
be
delightful
here
michelob
is
a
pretty
beer
light
in
color
allowing
you
to
see
the
carbonation
bubble
to
a
thick
richlooking
head
the
smell
was
almost
nonexistant
almost
watery
thats
where
the
taste
comes
in
watery
i
dont
know
what
they
did
but
i
found
no
trace
of
hops
anywhere
on
my
palet
this
beer
is
what
it
is
a
macrobrew
devoid
of
any
distinct
flavor
or
character
but
good
when
its
had
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
ill
drink
it
if
the
sam
adams

is
all
gone
light

medium

very
light

very

some

mouthfeel

aftertaste
is
very
slightly
bitter
slightly
lemony
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
nothing
very
good
about
it
either
at
least
there
is
some
taste
to
this
light
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
but
wish
it
had
some
more

this
is
better
than
most

even
though
i
costs
a
bit
more
i
would
still
get
it
if
i
were
going
to
drink
a
light
lager
for
the
night
over
other
macros
not
much
in
taste
but
thats
better
than
the
others
pretty
smooth
and
creamy
which
is
kind
of
surprising
a
little
better
that
others
in
its
field
but
that
still
doesnt
mean
its
good
an
acceptable
session
beer
for
thirst
quenching
and
the
ensuing
socializing
mouthfeel
is
paper
thin
drinkability
is
good
for
a
light
beer
if
you
have
to
drink
or
serve
light
go
for
sam
adams
special

or
leinies
amber
i
too
had
thisone
at
easter
for
it
was
the
chioce
at
the
time
it
appeard
clear
straw
in
color
with
a
bit
high
on
carbonation
the
head
was
fizzy
and
shortlived
lace
was
little
the
body
was
watery
but
not
as
much
as
ultra
the
brew
was
smooth
and
drinkable
if
very
cold
it
will
quench
a
hot
days
thirst
the
taste
offered
no
real
hop
or
malt
notice
just
a
grain
grassy
taste
and
mouthfeel
overall
ok
if
choice
is
slim
no
real
hops
detected
exactly
what
i
thought
it
would
be
fizzy
grain
water
i
just
cant
stand
ab
products
that
awful
taste
is
simply
present
in
each
and
everyone
of
their
beers
this
is
no
different
despite
the
standard
yellow
color
and
white
head
thats
gone
very
quickly
theres
always
that
same
mouthfeel
and
bad
flavor
this
is
probably
ok
if
you
can
stand
any
of
the
ab
products
i
just
cant
stomach
the
flavor
someday
ill
be
able
to
describe
because
ill
likley
keep
sampling
their
stuff
til
i
figure
it
out
drinkability
overall
not
that

i
got
two
free
bottles
and
after
i
drank
them
i
had
a

this
light
beer
is
not
offensive
but
not
enjoyable
either
surprisingly
good

slightly

up
a

as

but
not
too
much
as
compared
to

macros
by
busch
this
light
brew
leaves
you
wanting
first
let
me
say
i
dont
consider
light
beer
to
be
real
beer
i
tried
this
with
reservations
but
a
friend
of
mine
swears
by
it
michelob
light
pours
extremely
light
yellow
forget
a
head
or
any
other
good
looks
taste
is
watered
down
swill
very
chemical
like
twang
i
had
trouble
finishing
this
i
was
actually
pissed
off
that
a
beer
this
expensive
is
so
awfull
had
a
can
of
this
and
a
can
of
labatt
blue
light
at
a
bluejackets
game
back
and
forth
i
went
between
the
two
back
and
forth
labatt
and
michelob
michelob
and
labatt
there
literally
was
no
difference
both
had
next
to
no
aroma
or
flavor
both
sucked
sour
frog
ass
taste
tests
between
two
crappy
beers
are
not
fun
at
least
they
were
free
mich
light
even
my
macro
swilling
friends
had
to
admit
that
this
was
one
poor
looking
beer
weak
yellow
color
so
much
so
that
i
had
a
macro
swiller
claiming
that
it
was
not
a
bad
thing
if
a
beer
looked
like
urine
must
i
review
it
ok
yellow
no
head
no
body
no
hops
no
taste
no
nothing
better
than
bud
but
who
gives
a
rodents
rump
my
verdict
a
slightly
more
tasty
version
of
bud
light
that
is
quite
drinkable
but
i
dont
see
the
point
in
paying
premium
prices
for
a
light
beer
kind
of
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
i
would
suppose
and
probably
a
good
swill
beer
to
have
around
if
the
guys
are
over
i
used
to
drink
these
all
the
time
from
9701
it
was
probably
my
beer
of
choice
revisited
it
this
weekend
pours
a
nearly
clear
to
yellow
color
thin
wispy
white
head
smelled
alot
of
the
same
grainy
smells
as
the
other
ab
products
but
less
offensive
it
had
some
beer
like
qualities
faint
hops
and
a
decent
crisp
finish
but
way
to
watery
might
be
an
ok
choice
at
dinner
with
nothing
else
to
choose
from
certainly
better
than
bud
light
okay
i
am
not
a
fan
of
light
beers
this
is
obviously
better
than
than
their
bud
light
and
natural
light
but
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
very
little
body
taste
or
character
to
it
when
will
somebody
get
the
light
beers
right
again
light
beer
just
doesnt
make
sense
and
michelight
isnt
any
different
if
there
is
such
a
thing
yesterday
a
warm
sunny
day
seemed
the
best
time
to
try
a
light
beer
i
was
outdoors
at
a
fair
and
gave
michelob
light
a
try
im
sorry
that
i
did
overcarbonated
with
absolutely
no
taste
the
beer
was
repulsive
despite
being
an
ab
product
i
really
cant
complain
with
this
one
it
is
probably
one
of
the
best
light
beers
around
everyone
likes
the
bottle
too
i
like
it
at
dinner
nothing
about
this
beer
really
distinguishes
it
i
had
it
while
partaking
in
several
bowls
of
chili
the
other
day
refreshing
with
a
very
very
light
hop
taste
but
moreso
than
most
lights
i
can
find
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
and
nothing
outstanding
i
actually
think
this
is
better
tasting
than
regular
michelob
i
normally
dont
review
macros
but
100
reviews
is
within
striking
distance
so
ill
throw
this
one
in
i
had
one
last
night
at
my
brothers
im
taking
care
of
his
cat
and
its
the
only
thing
they
had
in
their
fridge
its
not
terrible
but
i
deserve
better
for
scooping
out
the
kitty
litter
i
rate
this
compared
to
good
beers
compared
to
most
light
beers
this
one
isnt
bad
im
not
sure
if
they
use
rice
in
this
one
but
it
definitely
has
a
different
flavor
im
guessing
they
do
use
rice
a
bit
more
flavor
than
most
light
beers
but
at
130
plus
calories
i
would
hope
so
as
light
beers
go
this
is
pretty
decent
and
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
handle
a
few
of
these
but
compared
to
good
beers
it
just
doesnt
rate
not
too
bad
for
a
light
beer
actually
quite
refreshing
for
a
hot
day
very
pale
in
color
and
ultra
light
and
clean
in
taste
it
seems
you
could
drink
these
forever
without
getting
filled
up
notes
such
a
clean
beer
almost
too
clean
there
are
worse
light
beers
out
there
but
this
one
leaves
you
wondering
how
much
stuff
was
filtered
out
of
this
beer
a
pale
shadow
of
the
fullweight
michelob
which
isnt
all
that
great
to
start
with
starts
sweet
but
finishes
with
a
grainy
adjunct
character
hops
had
a
synthetic
flavor
i
rated
this
in
comparison
to
other
light
beers
obviously
it
tastes
like
piss
water
compared
to
stouts
and
pale
ales
but
as
far
as
the
pretty
new
light
beers
go
this
one
isnt
the
worst
rating
to
style
you
think
it
tastes
like
water
what
aallight
lager
doesnt
and
if
you
think
it
tastes
like
piss
i
have
no
perspective
because
that
is
a
flavor
profile
im
not
familiar
with
in
my
opinion
the
worst
of
the
shitty
light
beers
gross
taste
like
someone
put
water
in
there
beer
and
shook
it
up
rather
just
drink
water
would
rather
just
not
drink
favorite
light
beer
so
far
i
thought
maybe
drinking
this
by
the
pool
in
the
hot
florida
sun
might
make
this
beer
a
little
bit
tolerable
the
choice
was
this
or
corona
without
a
lime
if
it
had
been
wlime
i
would
have
opted
for
it
i
was
wrong
i
honestly
felt
like
i
wanted
to
puke
after
finishing
my
16
oz
blue
aluminum
bottle
if
i
never
drink
another
one
of
these
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
will
definitely
be
cool
with
that
worst
beer
ever
drink
yueng
ling
instead
same
price
better
beer
beer
pong
beer
that
is
all
it
is
nasty
when
i
like
to
feel
like
trailer
trash
i
drink
this
it
looks
like
beer
but
it
tastes
like
liquid
cardboard
i
have
no
idea
why
so
many
people
choose
this
over
the
many
better
and
cheaper
alternatives
this
beer
tastes
like
celery
blah
blah
blah
blah
beer
party
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
this
beer
is
awful
just
plain
bad
brew
pours
a
pale
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
pretty
thin
white
cap
some
sheets
of
spotty
lacing
was
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
really
nothing
to
mention
just
some
light
grassy
grains
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
very
watered
down
with
not
much
taste
ends
with
a
slight
metallic
taste
which
might
or
might
not
be
from
the
aluminum
bottle
lightbodied
with
above
average
carbonation
why
i
drank
some
of
these
over
the
years
before
i
discovered
some
good
brews
and
brewstyles
is
beyond
me
overall
why
bother
to
drink
this
no
matter
what
fancycool
bottle
they
use
this
is
a
below
average
brew
in
my
opinion
ok
so
its
really
bad
but
its
the
best
of
the
worst
syrupy
piss
water
if
ive
ever
tasted
it
its
a
very
flavorless
beer
that
you
straight
up
shouldnt
drink
its
an
okay
beer
would
rather
have
a
coors
light
omg
this
is
ridiculous
so
much
decent
for
cheap
price
beer
watery
beer
with
no
taste
bland
taste
like
water
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
in
it
felt
nauseous
when
i
drank
it
coupled
with
the
taste
of
rotten
wheat
in
my
mouth
pure
piss
only
drink
it
when
theres
nothing
else
cheep
easy
beer
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
and
not
enjoy
your
beer
drink
this
cheap
drunk
strictly
lake
beer
for
your
buddies
this
is
an
average
beer
a
cheep
way
of
being
able
to
drink
all
day
besides
making
you
go
to
the
bathroom
a
lot
it
is
ok
it
taste
a
like
a
well
hydrated
horse
took
a
piss
its
drinkable
if
you
drink
beer
you
drink
beer
it
is
what
it
is
beer
snobs
just
love
to
hate
this
beer
why
even
bother
with
this
absolutely
one
of
the
worst
beers
see
review
of
budweiser
this
is
beer
for
washing
down
hot
dogs
at
a
ball
game
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
ive
never
met
a
beer
i
didnt
like
there
are
just
varying
degrees
of
amiability
bud
light
is
like
an
acquaintance
i
dont
mind
getting
drunk
with
once
a
year
o
i
dont
personally
like
the
style
but
for
what
this
is
its
well
made
o
bleh
great
for
micheladas
but
meh
it
is
what
i
like
is
that
so
bad
i
wish
this
wasnt
produced
this
is
the
garbage
people
try
and
then
think
oh
i
dont
like
beer
this
isnt
beer
sometimes
you
happen
to
like
consistency
awful
schmegma
for
the
3
years
post
college
when
youre
still
stupid
great
daily
beer
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
bud
light
what
do
you
expect
i
actually
dont
find
this
to
be
a
terrible
beer
its
nothing
good
by
any
means
but
its
not
bad
definitely
better
than
the
regular
version
however
there
are
handfuls
upon
handfuls
of
better
alternatives
what
else
is
there
to
say
its
bud
light
wish
i
had
a
peach
pumpkin
ale
o
despite
the
prominence
of
the
adjunct
corn
this
is
not
the
horrible
swill
its
made
out
to
be
its
main
flaw
is
that
it
basically
lacks
any
notable
beer
character
this
is
pretty
fresh
and
goes
down
easy
meaning
its
not
the
worst
thing
to
drink
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
its
awful
cheap
tasting
beer
best
beer
ever
im
a
redneck
and
we
all
love
this
beer
wish
i
could
make
sweet
love
to
it
had
the
misfortune
of
showing
up
to
a
meathead
party
that
only
had
this
offering
took
about
3
sips
and
had
to
dump
it
absolutely
horrid
i
feel
sorry
for
anyone
who
thinks
this
is
good
beer
even
worse
than
bw
and
thats
saying
a
lot
why
bother
it
looks
the
same
coming
out
as
it
did
going
in
super
popular
watery
adjunct
lager
with
no
further
description
needed
this
is
not
beer
and
its
terrible
almost
no
aroma
and
the
taste
is
essentially
watery
and
slightly
sweet
with
no
hop
presence
water
will
do
the
trick
this
beer
is
watered
down
a
lot
ehhh
not
good
at
all
not
not
bad
a
great
casual
beer
to
drink
with
friends
take
budweiser
the
watered
down
beer
that
helped
gave
north
american
beer
a
bad
name
for
many
years
piss
in
it
and
drink
it
thats
what
bud
light
tastes
like
even
looks
a
pale
foamy
light
yellow
like
someone
pissed
in
a
glass
of
budweiser
one
of
the
sorriest
excuses
for
a
beer
in
around
i
once
pissed
a
mixture
of
gatorade
milk
and
bud
light
i
bottled
the
urine
stream
into
an
old
bud
light
bottle
and
served
an
unexpecting
exgirlfriend
she
couldnt
tell
the
difference
i
think
she
even
got
a
lil
krunk
from
it
typical
american
adjacent
lager
light
smooth
flavorless
and
not
worth
a
full
review
decent
for
a
camp
fire
or
bbq
if
you
in
to
watching
your
calorie
intake
many
people
claim
this
beer
taste
like
piss
to
which
i
ask
tell
me
how
you
know
what
piss
taste
like
again
gross
closer
to
seltzer
water
than
beer
their
slogan
is
up
for
whatever
because
you
literally
have
to
be
up
for
whatever
to
drink
this
grew
up
on
this
stuff
which
is
probably
the
only
reason
i
ever
drink
it
now
good
for
learning
that
is
about
it
id
put
miller
light
a
bit
higher
i
dont
particularly
drink
light
beer
i
was
given
a
six
pack
of
8
ounces
bottles
as
a
gift
it
is
drinkable
especially
after
a
workout
terrible
very
light
and
no
flavor
j
serving
type
on
tap
urinate
in
a
can
and
commence
drinking
there
you
have
bud
light
i
rated
slightly
higher
than
miller
light
as
i
preferred
bud
light
for
a
while
but
im
proud
to
say
that
i
no
longer
have
any
in
my
house
their
tag
line
should
be
why
europeans
think
yanks
dont
understand
beer
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
f
no
this
is
a
peace
of
s
served
too
cold
to
smelltaste
how
awful
it
is
its
ok
for
beer
pong
overall
fresh
dirty
water
im
embarrassed
to
say
ive
ever
drank
this
crap
awuful
bottom
line
no
reason
to
drink
this
hamms
is
cheaper
as
far
as
light
beer
goes
hardly
being
beer
at
all
this
is
passable
quite
possibly
one
of
the
worst
beers
ever
frat
parties
and
kegs
college
yep
thats
bud
light
just
good
old
fashioned
american
light
beer
i
give
it
credit
for
what
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
for
when
your
say
drinking
with
people
who
dont
care
what
theyre
drinking
its
the
cheapest
beer
ill
buy
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
taste
but
its
very
drinkable
almost
anyone
will
accept
a
bud
light
and
willingly
drink
it
looks
great
but
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
very
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
i
love
this
beer
very
upset
that
i
was
brain
washed
by
this
beer
company
into
believing
that
this
was
the
only
choice
of
beer
rice
is
not
a
beer
ingredient
mmm
gotta
love
small
town
bars
that
refuse
to
have
any
alternatives
really
good
when
you
get
to
the
12th
or
13th
one
tastes
like
fizzy
water
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
skunk
its
a
diet
beer
for
the
style
it
is
not
great
it
is
unbalanced
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
i
believe
that
derives
from
the
adjuncts
used
not
a
great
style
but
definitely
a
great
example
of
the
style
did
is
a
brew
is
drink
used
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
super
thick
head
that
thins
to
a
quarter
inch
smells
like
chemicals
and
corn
goes
down
really
smooth
but
dry
not
much
flavor
what
so
ever
for
a
light
beer
its
not
too
bad
ehhh
not
bad
for
this
kind
of
beer
my
point
being
that
for
me
the
fact
that
you
can
drink
endless
amounts
of
this
beer
and
never
get
drunk
or
gain
a
pound
isnt
a
point
in
its
favor
overall
i
am
not
sure
what
accounts
for
the
popularity
of
this
rotten
piss
water
this
is
truly
some
of
the
worst
stuff
ive
ever
endured
and
dont
tell
me
that
its
popular
because
its
cheap
there
are
any
number
of
cheap
alternatives
that
easily
beat
out
this
awful
slop
i
felt
obligated
to
try
it
because
because
you
know
i
forgot
a
long
time
ago
why
i
even
ordered
this
well
now
at
least
i
can
say
from
experience
that
this
beer
is
not
worth
drinking
thats
the
booby
prize
i
suppose
boring
and
bland
for
sure
not
a
lot
of
flavor
busch
light
is
better
busch
light
is
my
lawn
mower
lager
in
the
summer
time
bud
light
doesnt
tank
simply
because
it
is
one
of
the
easiest
beers
to
drink
period
supreme
drinkabilty
takes
this
beer
where
it
needs
to
be
comparing
this
to
other
bmc
beers
this
is
better
than
coors
mainly
because
of
the
metallic
taste
present
in
coors
light
miller
lite
is
a
little
stronger
flavor
for
what
this
beer
sets
out
to
be
which
is
a
bland
boring
beer
with
very
little
taste
it
reigns
supreme
this
is
for
people
who
just
want
a
hint
of
beer
taste
this
isnt
really
something
i
would
compare
to
sierra
nevada
or
sam
adams
its
just
a
light
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
party
beers
in
my
opinion
sam
adams
boston
lager
was
my
first
good
quality
beer
ive
had
so
many
beers
i
cant
really
remember
which
one
i
had
first
had
to
have
been
sa
boston
lager
or
blue
moon
belgian
white
then
my
3rd
one
was
bud
light
i
actually
enjoy
bud
light
i
have
nostalgia
with
bud
its
been
me
and
my
buddys
fishing
beer
and
party
beer
since
2
years
ago
lot
of
memories
the
alcohol
wasnt
what
made
the
memories
its
the
being
with
friends
all
having
a
good
time
the
fact
it
was
bud
light
just
makes
me
like
this
beer
may
not
be
good
compared
to
real
flavored
beer
its
just
my
official
party
beer
you
bring
in
the
bud
light
its
usually
my
first
30
pack
finished
at
the
party
followed
by
the
coors
light
and
bud
light
lime
people
i
party
with
also
love
corona
pretty
much
you
will
find
this
at
any
party
worth
a
damn
or
alternatively
miller
lite
or
coors
light
or
busch
too
ive
brought
busch
were
talking
southern
parties
in
corn
fields
with
bonfires
brought
some
busch
light
and
some
bud
light
and
it
was
a
good
night
any
party
worth
anything
at
all
will
have
bud
coors
or
miller
or
maybe
busch
but
other
than
that
none
of
the
off
brand
products
this
is
the
supreme
party
beer
for
beer
pong
some
good
times
partying
with
this
beer
still
lot
better
things
out
there
just
advertising
makes
this
sell
so
well
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
unless
there
are
no
other
choices
this
beer
has
its
time
and
place
and
is
definitely
better
than
no
beer
at
all
for
a
light
beer
its
okay
but
its
really
not
good
i
have
never
thought
that
its
so
great
but
nor
i
think
that
its
so
awful
its
a
good
choice
to
drink
on
a
weekend
night
while
watching
something
with
your
friends
or
family
specially
because
here
it
usually
have
discounts
such
as
24
beers
for
8
usd
the
taste
is
bland
but
although
it
is
not
a
great
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
good
for
people
who
are
just
beginning
to
drink
beer
this
swill
is
just
above
natty
light
and
i
mean
just
only
because
i
dont
feel
like
i
just
drank
old
well
water
after
it
goes
down
dont
understand
how
its
so
popular
would
never
buy
i
marked
this
as
want
i
cant
find
this
anywhere
its
so
polarizing
that
ive
got
to
try
it
if
only
momma
could
lend
me
the
keys
to
her
mini
van
so
i
could
drive
into
town
to
find
it
looks
like
its
toilet
wine
again
i
wouldnt
drink
this
unless
i
was
already
a
few
beers
deep
on
good
beer
already
and
even
then
its
questionable
camel
piss
may
taste
better
does
the
job
why
are
you
reading
reviews
for
this
you
know
what
bud
light
tastes
like
the
fact
that
their
selling
point
is
drinkability
with
little
else
mentioned
already
tells
you
everything
you
need
to
know
its
cheap
light
beer
that
accomplishes
exactly
what
its
trying
to
accomplish
it
goes
down
easy
its
drinkable
but
its
hardly
a
beer
if
camo
is
one
of
your
favorite
patterns
to
wear
on
your
everyday
attire
then
youd
more
than
likely
go
gaga
over
this
carbonated
urine
looks
reasonably
like
a
beer
but
no
smell
or
feel
to
speak
of
and
next
to
no
taste
a
reasonable
substitute
for
water
only
offensive
in
its
lack
of
beerness
it
doesnt
taste
unpleasant
it
just
doesnt
taste
at
all
overall
i
like
that
it
came
served
in
a
patriots
bud
light
glass
i
gave
this
beer
a
legit
shot
i
drank
it
with
hot
dogs
while
watching
sports
effectively
handing
it
home
field
advantage
but
its
just
bad
theres
no
reason
to
drink
this
as
long
as
tap
water
remains
free
first
thing
i
would
do
in
a
time
machine
destroy
this
beer
id
rather
drink
urine
a
great
introduction
into
the
world
of
beer
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
beer
you
want
in
a
bong
it
will
not
get
the
love
here
because
the
lack
of
taste
but
with
out
most
wouldnt
be
here
i
find
this
beer
so
much
worse
than
natty
light
for
whatever
reason
ill
turn
my
nose
up
at
it
for
sure
but
at
a
pinch
ill
drink
it
gets
the
job
done
if
getting
wasted
is
all
you
want
absolutely
no
flavor
water
and
corn
is
all
i
taste
dont
expect
much
from
this
beer
good
for
tailgates
this
isnt
bad
but
really
nothing
going
to
speak
of
its
flavor
or
lack
thereof
is
the
reason
so
many
people
like
this
in
my
lineup
of
light
beers
this
doesnt
get
a
metallic
taste
people
on
here
tell
people
to
start
with
the
strong
beers
trust
me
my
cousin
did
that
and
he
hates
beer
now
start
on
something
light
people
say
dont
let
bud
light
be
someones
first
beer
honestly
when
you
first
start
drinking
beer
you
want
something
with
a
little
flavor
but
nothing
too
strong
the
reason
i
say
this
is
i
started
with
blue
moon
i
almost
hated
beer
from
the
beginning
because
i
tried
something
so
strong
then
my
friend
gave
me
a
bud
light
i
took
a
drink
it
was
nice
and
refreshing
and
didnt
overwhelm
me
with
flavor
it
was
good
the
reason
people
buy
bud
light
and
its
the
number
one
selling
beer
in
america
is
because
it
doesnt
offend
its
light
doesnt
have
much
flavor
and
is
really
refreshing
nothing
to
speak
about
but
nothing
that
offends
either
it
gets
a
three
out
of
five
its
an
average
macro
lager
that
being
said
its
very
watery
no
real
great
flavor
coors
light
is
a
better
beer
but
both
are
bad
do
yourself
a
favor
spend
a
little
bit
more
of
money
or
less
quantity
for
a
better
beer
you
might
as
well
be
drinking
water
with
a
nasty
taste
generally
inoffensive
light
in
body
and
high
in
carbonation
out
of
all
the
macro
lagers
this
is
my
least
favorite
unpalatable
worst
beer
i
can
think
of
with
the
exception
of
warm
honduran
beers
in
clear
glass
bottles
the
gray
water
from
rinsing
out
my
morning
oatmeal
bowl
has
more
grain
flavor
than
this
swill
this
isnt
good
even
if
its
free
friends
shouldnt
let
friends
drink
shitty
beer
i
drink
this
at
parties
for
free
lol
it
beats
naty
light
and
not
drinking
at
all
would
drink
for
free
straightup
average
in
every
way
nothing
special
here
we
all
can
agree
but
with
0
fat
and
minimal
calories
it
does
make
it
the
water
of
choice
not
a
huge
fan
of
light
beers
this
im
favorite
of
the
lot
smooth
velvety
finish
overall
impression
drink
something
else
you
may
never
complain
about
the
quality
of
free
beer
temperature
of
said
beer
remains
an
open
subject
far
from
the
best
tasting
beer
i
feel
guilty
admitting
that
this
beer
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart
when
i
have
to
play
a
concert
i
can
drink
a
few
without
getting
truly
drunk
just
perpetually
buzzed
obviously
not
the
brew
of
choice
for
beer
snobs
overall
2

i
know
why
people
buy
this
stuff
its
because
theres
almost
nothing
to
be
offended
at
and
it
drinks
like
a
soda
when
you
have
no
taste
theres
less
chance
of
bitterness
or
offnotes
the
longer
you
brew
a
beer
the
more
broken
down
it
gets
and
thus
you
have
light
beer
i
far
prefer
the
full
taste
of
budweiser
over
a
bud
light
about
10
to
1
but
bud
light
isnt
half
bad
if
youre
looking
for
a
refreshing
drink
for
the
crowd
that
no
one
will
object
to
best
beer
ever
that
would
be
ludicrous
best
beer
for
frat
parties
that
might
even
be
stretching
it
best
beer
for
beerignorant
tastechallenged
rowdy
boys
and
girls
who
sit
around
the
bonfire
sharing
prepubescent
humor
and
chasing
tail
now
thats
more
like
it
always
good
o
i
refuse
to
drink
this
anymore
even
if
free
drain
pour
its
dirty
water
this
is
what
you
get
when
you
pee
in
miller
lite
a
somehow
more
disappointing
beer
at
least
the
extreme
carbonation
is
a
little
less
harsh
but
otherwise
theres
just
nothing
here
its
like
alcoholic
water
its
just
sooo
blah
i
really
dont
understand
the
extreme
fanaticism
of
the
fans
of
this
beer
i
am
a
sea
creature
look
it
up
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
mostly
rice
if
anything
at
all
the
taste
was
a
lot
more
rice
was
not
a
fan
but
to
just
have
something
at
a
party
i
can
understand
why
this
would
be
chosen
i
should
not
be
able
to
clearly
read
small
print
through
a
beer
though
thank
you
for
your
time
and
attention
god
bless
you
god
bless
bud
light
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
i
accidently
took
a
mouthful
of
this
redneck
swill
during
a
beerpong
game
hosted
by
a
20
something
friend
of
mine
i
quickly
reaffirmed
my
commitment
to
avoiding
this
corn
water
crap
3
8
redneck
corn
water
seriously
it
tastes
like
someone
poured
the
juice
off
a
can
of
corn
into
a
glass
with
the
smallest
bit
of
grain

selling
beer
in
america
no
wonder
we
are
in
such
trouble
lets
see
here
the
appearance
looks
like
urine
it
also
smells
like
urine
taste
is
comparable
to
ball
sweat
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thin
overall
terrible
lager
however
it
doesnt
taste
as
bad
in
a
can
in
the
can
its
actually
rather
sweet
and
i
would
describe
it
as
malty
pours
a
piss
yellow
color
with
a
head
that
disappears
in
seconds
smells
like
a
skunked
beer
when
its
chilled
tastes
like
every
other
mass
produced
american
lager
malty
and
makes
you
want
to
finish
it
as
fast
as
possible
trying
to
avoid
what
it
tastes
like
if
it
gets
to
a
balmy
40
degrees
fahrenheit
honestly
wasnt
in
my
mouth
long
enough
to
tell
you
how
it
felt
sadly
i
will
buy
it
again
just
because
its
cheap
and
its
hard
to
argue
with
14
bucks
for
a
case
please
dont
let
your
friends
let
this
be
their
first
beer
bud
light
25
pours
a
pale
straw
with
a
huge
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
is
bland
the
flavor
profile
tastes
like
watery
corn
even
in
my
days
of
regularly
drinking
aals
i
simply
could
not
handle
diet
aals
i
cant
believe
that
people
buy
this
beer
by
the
case
and
consume
mass
quantities
of
it
there
must
be
a
better
way
of
getting
plastered
has
just
a
bit
more
flavor
than
bud55
but
still
almost
none
when
it
comes
down
to
it
no
over
the
top
offflavors
like
people
describe
but
nothing
good
to
speak
of
overall
it
is
what
it
is
it
is
a
great
beer
for
when
your
hot
sweaty
and
need
a
thirst
quencher
i
drank
this
for
the
beginning
of
my
adult
life
and
many
of
my
friends
drink
it
a
lot
of
it
i
will
take
one
of
these
if
it
left
at
my
house
or
a
friend
swaps
one
of
these
for
one
of
my
more
tasty
brews
but
i
surely
would
not
buy
it
i
drink
pabst
and
miller
for
cheap
beer
i
keep
some
of
this
on
hand
when
im
out
of
craft
beer
and
dont
wanna
stop
or
funds
are
low
i
rarely
to
never
drink
bud
unless
it
is
free
o
hell
it
tastes
watered
down
and
its
4
2
clearly
designed
for
someone
trying
to
throw
a
few
back
clearly
a
youth
party
favorite
but
if
drunk
for
appreciation
nothing
to
write
home
about
or
purchase
in
the
first
place
wake
up
people
you
could
buy
a
craft
brew
for
nearly
the
same
price
water
it
down
to
like
23rds
water
and
13rd
of
the
craft
beer
and
it
would
still
have
more
flavor
than
bud
light
and
youd
probably
have
3
x
as
much
fluid
oz
for
your
buck
overall
piss
poor
will
not
drink
again
overall
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
the
beer
has
corn
cereal
flavors
with
a
huge
lack
of
flavor
from
the
watery
qualities
of
the
beer
it
almost
tastes
like
seltzer
with
how
watery
this
beer
is
bud
light
isnt
as
bad
as
its
made
out
to
be
if
youre
doing
lawn
work
or
watching
the
game
why
not
throw
back
a
bud
light
i
challenge
anyone
here
to
brew
a
clone
of
a
bud
light
and
see
what
you
come
up
with
hangoverwise
probably
a
good
choice
as
a
starter
its
an
easy
goto
beer
its
inexpensive
goes
down
easy
leaves
no
aftertaste
not
much
taste
but
it
works
its
a
beer
you
can
go
to
whenever
never
a
bad
time
for
a
bud
light
its
not
a
special
beer
or
anything
like
that
but
its
a
good
light
beer
not
my
favorite
but
ive
got
no
complaints
i
can
easily
drink
bud
light
anytime
who
hasnt
had
a
bud
light
classic
american
beer
if
you
dont
know
what
to
order
at
a
bar
with
a
bud
light
you
cant
go
wrong
you
can
find
this
beer
at
almost
every
bar
it
is
light
in
color
and
goes
down
smooth
the
after
taste
isnt
too
bad
and
you
can
drink
a
lot
without
getting
too
full
bud
light
for
frat
boys
and
girls
that
dont
know
good
beer
25
my
opinion
bud
light
is
highly
over
rated
its
one
step
above
water
although
it
does
taste
ok
but
to
a
well
rounded
beer
taster
it
is
weak
cost
is
comparable
to
other
american
beers
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
unless
it
was
cheaper
than
a
competitor
i
cant
believe
this
beer
is
so
popular
because
it
lack
character
in
my
book
excessively
bubbly
devoid
of
taste
and
a
lingering
chemical
feeling
in
ones
mouth
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
if
cost
is
your
motivator
theres
plenty
of
cheaper
beers
on
the
market
that
exceed
in
taste
and
quality
start
with
pretty
much
any
beer
on
this
website
including
a
watery
blatz
it
will
be
a
step
upwards
its
not
supposed
to
compete
with
craftsman
beer
and
it
doesnt
face
it
weve
all
had
our
share
of
domestic
mass
produced
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
in
that
category
quit
dogging
bud
light
its
cheap
mass
produced
beer
watered
down
catpiss
unfortunately
the
only
option
at
some
places
although
the
aroma
is
far
from
nice
flavor
is
not
utterly
unpleasant
still
i
wonder
how
i
could
drink
this
when
i
was
a
teenager
in
fact
im
drinking
one
right
now
after
indulging
in
uplands
infinite
wisdom
tripel
the
very
first
sip
has
a
nice
distinct
wheat
flavor
after
that
its
barely
a
notch
above
water
about
the
only
thing
this
is
good
for
is
when
youre
outside
grilling
on
a
hot
day
not
worried
about
taste
and
you
want
to
have
a
small
buzz
with
your
friends
also
its
cheap
i
avoid
it
unless
its
the
only
thing
available
sometimes
i
still
avoid

remember

this
beer
is
the
thing
in
the
house
i
am
most
nervous
about
finding
bud

is
a

beer
this
beer
is
brewed
by
anheuser

with
an

light
amber

lighter
than
budweiser
taste
is

not

just
smooth
the
smell
is
a
light
beer
smell
not
much
here
over
all
a
good
drinking
beer
on
a
hot
day
o
its
drinkable
it
has
no
character
whatsoever
though
i
cant
rate
it
too
poor
because
there
are
much
worse
lower
alcohol
light
beers
out
there
ok
so
bud
light
what
can
i
say
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
by
any
means
ive
certainly
had
my
share
on
drinking
it
of
course
but
the
taste
is
sort
of
hard
to
explain
for
me
kind
of
a
lightstrongtasteless
taste
if
that
makes
sense
its
good
when
its
ice
cold
dont
bother
if
its
warm
my
advice
grab
some
buds
and
go
somewhere
that
serves
a
proper
brew
o
well
as
most
young
people
i
also
started
drinking
beers
like
this
and
enjoyed
them
recently
i
have
experimented
with
all
sorts
of
different
types
of
beer
and
discovered
that
i
prefer
a
more
complex
flavor
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
this
beer
has
a
time
and
place
not
my
favorite
but
its
ok
overall
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
respecting
all
beer
i
should
not
be
rating
this
beer
i
dont
like
any
of
these
watered
down
commercialized
domestic
beers
due
to
its
popularity
i
am
often
asked
what
i
think
about
this
beer
the
only
way
to
give
an
honest
opinion
is
to
try
it
this
beer
taste
like
the
water
after
the
beer
glass
is
rinsed
it
does
go
down
smooth
for
people
who
like
the
idea
of
drinking
beer
but
dont
like
the
taste
of
real
beer
this
buds
for
you
overall
not
that
great
for
a
light
beer
the
king
of
beers
light
version
pours
a
barely
yellow
body
very
light
not
much
aroma
taste
is
wet
cardboard
and
stale
malt
flavor
is
more
off
putting
than
bland
and
actually
had
trouble
finishing
my
glass
which
i
didnt
proof
that
marketing
trumps
flavor
in
this
case
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
to
love
beer
bud
light
will
always
be
my
number
one
favorite
beer
its
fairly
cheap
but
it
doesnt
taste
real
cheap
to
me
its
smooth
and
refreshing
my
number
one
choice
when
i
want
a
beer
no
its
not
all
i
drink
i
drink
many
other
brands
but
i
love
my
bud
light
theres
a
reason
college
students
drink
this
beer
overall
this
beer
is
great
when
throwing
them
down
in
beer
pong
but
not
in
many
other
circumstances
im
sure
youve
had
bud
light
before
so
you
probably
know
what
im
talking
about
anyways
i
think
weve
all
drank
budlight
before
if
you
havent
then
i
dont
know
where
the
fuck
youre
from
its
watery
and
weak
but
isnt
all
together
disgusting
its
beer
flavored
water
oh
and
for
some
reason
i
get
the
worst
hangovers
from
budlight
it
is
also
the
most
commonly
drank
beer
around
where
i
live
which
is
strange
overall
10
10
perfect
drink
probably
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
i
dont
know
how
annheuserbusch
and
all
the
stores
that
carry
this
product
could
distribute
this
beer
and
be
okay
with
it
every
bottle
leaves
you
feeling
sick
and
unsatisfied
absolutely
terrible
this
beer
is
basically
piss
bud
light
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
started
drinking
about
10
years
ago
i
never
knew
what
beer
was
suppose
to
be
like
or
if
this
was
what
all
other
beers
competed
against
to
the
public
man
was
i
wrong
i
soon
discovered
other
flavors
aromas
and
depth
in
beers
that
bud
light
didnt
offer
although
i
do
enjoy
darker
beers
now
i
got
to
say
bud
light
still
holds
a
place
in
my
heart
lets
be
real
you
can
grab
a
30pk
at
times
for
16
during
a
major
holiday
or
sporting
event
even
if
it
doesnt
hold
up
to
other
beers
im
sure
it
will
be
around
for
a
long
time
to
come
family
and
friends
enjoy
this
pilsner
beer
and
when
its
around
i
wont
hesitate
to
grab
one
cheers
light
body
with
a
crisp
hop
presence
that
is
immediately
countered
by
an
unpleasant
lingering
metallic
adjunct
character
some
crisp
grassy
hop
flavor
but
its
killed
off
by
hints
of
metal
corn
and
rice
the
adjuncts
realy
overpower
what
could
be
a
decent
tasting
light
lager
the
pale
malts
and
hops
are
obliterated
by
the
offensive
lingering
flavors

just
as
the
saying
goes
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
im
not
talking
about
the
consumer
the
big
bud
has
spent
little
and
put
little
into
this
beer
no
hops
taste
no
barley
taste
and
thats
what
you
get
it
could
be
so
much
more
but
why
bother
it
sells
and
so
lets
get
to
the
bottom
line
most
consumers
today
are
getting
a
corn
product
with
an
abv
content
and
less
sweet
than
sum
of
those
corn
syrup
mixes
out
there
but
little
hops
and
little
hopes
that
this
beer
will
change
for
the
better
thanks
mass
market
corpiarets
for
ruining
american
lager
but
that
said
it
will
still
get
u
a
dui
oh
and
if
this
beer
aint
made
from
corn
well
please
let
me
no
what
gmo
it
is
thanks
overall
in
terms
of
beer
its
horrible
its
sad
that
this
is
what
most
people
think
of
when
you
say
light
beer
or
even
beer
only
reason
why
im
giving
it
a
1
75
instead
of
anything
lower
is
because
it
doesnt
have
a
taste
that
makes
you
sick
its
well
carbonated
its
cheap
and
it
will
eventually
get
you
drunk
overall
how
do
i
loathe
this
beer
id
take
a
regular
bud
coors
miller
all
the
other
lights
and
even
most
of
the
natty
products
over
bud
light
its
easily
the
worst
of
all
the
beers
the
macros
have
to
offer
how
this
beer
is
the
number
one
selling
beer
in
the
us
continually
eludes
me
and
yes
i
did
save
this
beer
for
my
666th
review
p
alright
finally
had
it
after
ive
started
rating
was
hoping
to
try
100
beers
first
pours
with
a
light
white
head
of
foam
that
gradually
dissipates
entirely
crystal
clear
clarity
and
a
light
gold
color
aroma
of
rice
and
just
a
faint
bit
of
buttering
hops
very
light
and
crisp
body
flavor
is
rice
light
malt
and
very
faint
bitterings
hops
this
isnt
a
great
beer
it
is
weak
and
smells
bad
it
does
go
down
pretty
smooth
not
sure
if
that
is
because
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
taste
or
what
it
doesnt
rock
my
gut
like
bud
heavy
does
though
i
prefer
bud
heavy
this
is
a
decent
alternative
i
dont
want
to
come
off
as
a
snob
since
there
is
an
evident
majority
that
prefers
the
market
beers
but
there
is
also
a
growing
minority
of
beer
lovers
who
demand
a
better
beverage
and
im
so
thankful
that
the
craft
beer
community
is
exploding
and
raising
the
bar
i
can
only
hope
that
the
macros
take
the
hint
and
rejoin
the
competition
yea
its
bud
light
its
as
shitty
as
it
sounds
but
when
you
really
think
about
it
who
needs
fancy
shit
just
to
get
drunk
not
this
reviewer
thumbs
up
because
im
drunk
and
loving
it
the
rest
of
this
post
just
filler
to
get
to
the
250
character
limit
overall
if
you
havent
had
it
im
surprised
youre
on
this
website
this
short
story
is
better
than
this
beer
it
really
is
easy
to
see
why
this
is
the
best
selling
beer
in
the
world
the
stuff
goes
down
easier
than
water
but
brings
all
the
feeling
of
a
pleasant
buzz
if
youre
a
hop
head
or
someone
that
only
drinks
craft
you
have
no
business
here
but
if
you
like
to
spend
a
few
hours
enjoying
a
refreshing
beer
with
your
friends
bud
light
does
it
as
well
as
any
other
macro
light
also
like
most
of
us
i
am
the
proud
owner
of
a
decent
sized
beer
gut
a
light
beer
once
and
while
makes
me
feel
like
ive
made
healthy
choice
yes
theres
nothing
outstanding
about
bud
light
but
there
is
also
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
it
thats
what
makes
it
the
best
selling
beer
in
the
world
overall
god
awful
poor
quality
ingredients
and
its
half
rice
what
is
rice
doing
so
heavy
in
a
beer
o
nothing
memorable
about
the
beer
but
it
will
do
in
a
pinch
on
a
hot
day
its
best
out
of
a
ice
cold
cooler
o
had
78
of
em
but
my
wife
drank
some
of
those
and
others
i
put
down
and
never
remembered
to
pick
up
all
in
all
a
good
sippin
lager
go
a
halfday
without
drinking
water
and
your
urine
will
be
darker
than
this
and
probably
taste
a
little
better
too
this
is
rotten
stuff
almost
every
single
time
in
any
format
from
any
location
ive
somehow
not
reviewed
this
until
now
although
ive
ranted
about
it
constantly
not
just
for
its
low
quality
but
for
its
social
position
and
politics
both
of
which
i
cannot
tolerate
at
all
i
did
manage
to
have
this
fresh
at
the
brewery
though
and
must
confess
that
in
that
context
it
is
passable
albeit
as
a
light
adjunct
brew
it
didnt
have
its
usual
skunky
metallic
profile
in
normal
format
though
this
is
swill
i
wont
even
usually
touch
pee
yellow
very
fizzy
and
tasting
like
anything
but
good
fresh
beer
i
marvel
at
how
millions
of
people
consider
this
the
good
stuff
and
how
much
profit
it
generates
for
its
creators
to
me
i
would
rather
not
drink
honestly
the
amount
of
these
it
would
take
me
to
get
drunk
is
sickening
and
hopefully
i
wont
embark
on
that
mission
anytime
soon
arent
they
in
a
lawsuit
for
having
watered
this
down
watering
down
water
thats
a
laugh
o
its
just
a
bud
light
at
the
end
of
the
day
im
not
going
to
say
it
was
awful
because
really
it
wasnt
i
feel
like
too
many
craft
nerds
like
to
rip
on
bud
when
it
reality
its
not
bad
in
flavor
profile
its
just
absent
probably
would
never
buy
it
but
if
offered
it
i
have
no
real
problem
with
it
very
little
else
to
say
i
expected
water
and
got
metallic
water
the
best
way
to
describe
it
is
since
ive
had
real
good
beers
you
can
pick
out
so
many
different
characteristics
on
so
many
different
levels
it
blew
my
mind
how
different
they
were
even
within
a
same
style
then
you
try
a
bud
light
and
you
realize
its
made
to
be
cheap
get
you
drunk
and
as
clean
by
clean
i
mean
watery
and
hiding
any
flavor
as
possible
miller
light
would
be
a
better
choice
if
you
like
that
stuff
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
2
finger
width
carbonated
head
head
quickly
dissipates
with
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
has
more
of
a
sour
fruit
aroma
but
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
banana
at
the
end
a
little
sweeter
there
bready
malty
taste
with
a
slight
hop
edge
at
the
end
there
is
a
hint
of
cloves
and
banana
at
the
end
to
be
honest
as
far
as
the
type
of
beer
goes
it
isnt
bad
it
is
fairly
representative
i
wont
mistake
it
for
a
good
beer
though
there
is
still
more
of
a
watered
down
flavor
this
is
my
cheap
light
beer
of
choice
i
know
its
nothing
special
but
it
got
me
through
college
and
when
the
other
beers
i
could
afford
were
so
terrible
keystone
nattie
lite
this
felt
like
upper
class
so
i
will
always
have
room
and
nostalgia
for
bud
light
if
you
like
beer
that
tastes
very
watery
hear
you
go
this
is
something
i
would
buy
if
there
was
nothing
else
on
the
shelves
i
honestly
dont
know
why
millions
of
people
buy
this
beer
maybe
itt
the
fact
that
it
does
not
taste
like
beer
its
more
like
some
kind
of
oddly
flavored
soda
to
me
taste
is
of
cardboard
rice
and
hops
nothing
fills
it
out
this
beer
does
not
stand
out
in
any
way
its
hard
to
make
a
strong
protest
against
it
though
it
isnt
revolting
just
very
very
plain
it
doesnt
even
leave
an
aftertaste
i
guess
thats
a
good
thing
for
an
unimpressive
major
label
beer
lets
be
realistic
bud
light
may
not
be
craft
beer
but
it
has
got
more
people
laid
than
any
craft
beer
most
of
life
of
a
man
revolves
around
getting
laid
then
you
grow
up
get
married
then
getting
laid
doesnt
matter
as
much
when
is
the
last
time
pliny
got
you
laid
dont
hate
on
people
that
drink
light
beer
let
them
do
their
thing
most
girls
do
not
drink
craft
beer
if
they
drink
any
beer
at
all
i
personally
am
beer
spoiled
due
to
my
occupation
and
i
drink
tons
of
craft
beer
with
visits
to
russian
river
21st
amendment
victory
magic
hat
and
goose
island
so
far
this
year
the
only
reason
these
craft
beers
exist
is
because
anheuser
busch
lets
them
craft
beer
is
about
10
of
the
beer
industry
beer
is
meant
to
be
drank
drink
up
this
is
my
all
time
favorite
beer
for
a
everyday
drink
whether
its
after
a
long
day
of
work
or
even
a
tailgate
day
where
you
are
out
drinking
all
day
in
the
sun
this
is
the
beer
for
you
it
is
a
light
beer
that
is
nothing
special
served
cold
out
of
the
bottle
is
best
for
this
beer
its
look
is
light
and
carbonated
with
little
aroma
this
beer
is
good
for
any
occasion
o
this
beer
is
perhaps
the
leastaligned
brew
with
my
own
preferences
when
i
enjoy
hoppy
bitterness
in
a
beer
i
need
it
to
be
balanced
and
flavorful
this
is
neither
of
the
latter
i
cannot
stand
what
little
flavor
is
present
that
bitterness
might
work
for
other
people
judging
by
the
average
score
however
it
does
not
but
when
its
not
balanced
with
anything
else
its
just
not
for
me
i
thought
the
bud
light
was
very
good
the
appearance
was
a
light
yellow
coloring
the
smell
was
of
wheat
and
a
little
malt
to
it
the
taste
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
best
out
of
the
bottle
but
the
can
was
alright
too
the
aroma
was
not
that
good
and
was
a
little
bland
served
straight
from
a
tallboy
golden
yellow
appearance
and
a
classic
light
beer
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
american
beer
taste
toasted
grains
really
come
through
in
the
aroma
and
taste
but
there
is
not
much
flavor
diversity
beyond
that
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
has
a
lively
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
smooth
taste
with
bubbles
and
with
very
little
lingering
aftertaste
poured
from
a
tallboy
into
a
shaker
pint
i
cant
believe
im
doing
this
but
i
used
to
drink
so
much
of
it
before
that
i
almost
feel
compelled
to
give
it
a
shake
now
the
beer
is
a
pale
almost
clear
yellowish
coloring
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
sparse
coating
of
filmy
white
bubbling
fast
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
bubbling
aromas
of
toasted
grains
and
not
much
else
flavors
of
not
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
seriously
clean
with
some
toasted
grain
characteristics
but
very
subtle
aftertaste
is
funky
with
a
slightly
floral
and
sour
character
to
it
clean
crisp
finish
very
neat
and
clean
brew
but
lack
just
about
every
other
quality
this
by
far
is
my
favorite
beer
that
i
know
can
be
found
anywhere
and
is
light
allowing
you
to
drink
on
it
for
hours
at
a
time
basically
between
coors
light
miller
light
and
bud
light
i
will
always
go
with
bud
now
having
said
all
of
that
it
by
all
means
doesnt
make
it
the
best
it
terms
of
flavoring
and
sipping
on
a
beer
to
enjoy
its
creativity
this
obviously
isnt
the
beer
for
that
its
about
as
simple
and
generic
as
a
beer
can
get
but
it
does
have
drinkability
going
for
it
overal
this
beer
is
smooth
crisp
refreshing
balanced
easy
on
the
tongue
i
wanted
a
light
lager
i
got
it
i
was
not
looking
for
ale
stout
or
wheat
beer
would
buy
this
again
on
special
occasions
but
i
take
a
busch
light
or
natural
light
over
this
because
price
i
guess
i
prepared
myself
for
even
worse
but
bl
pretty
much
sucks
i
cannot
imagine
how
poorly
it
would
taste
if
it
werent
super
chilled
even
bud
light
platinum
is
significantly
better
at
least
according
to
my
review
get
me
an
ale
or
at
least
a
real
lager
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
hahahaha
my
first
sips
of
this
beverage
from
its
embarrassingly
designed
aluminium
bottle
were
remarkably
absent
of
any
sensation
at
all
when
cold
this
beer
is
indistinguishable
from
soda
water
as
it
warmed
a
soft
sweet
flavour
appeared
to
fill
the
drinks
middle
space
none
of
this
was
unpleasant
in
fact
i
was
impressed
by
the
skill
with
which
this
beer
was
executed
in
the
end
there
are
no
faults
flaws
or
any
hint
of
character
whatsoever
there
is
energy
here
but
no
substance
will
drink
it
if
there
are
no
other
full
beers
or
miller
lite
on
the
low
cal
side
not
horrible
but
not
something
you
should
seek
out
if
you
have
choices
if
you
must
drink
light
go
with
miller
but
this
one
is
better
than
coors
which
seems
to
be
the
three
major
light
beers
in
my
part
of
the
usa
i
have
not
tried
the
michelobe
lights
or
ultras
so
i
can
not
compare
them
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
what
is
the
point
of
drinking
a
waterdown
beer
i
may
ask
original
budweiser
was
nasty
enough
yet
they
managed
to
make
it
even
worse
every
time
i
watch
a
bud
light
ad
on
tv
i
feel
the
need
to
puke
my
guts
out
bad
bad
beer
cant
help
but
wonder
what
is
wrong
with
the
fellas
buying
those
12
or
18
can
cases
must
have
their
taste
buds
damaged
or
something
bud
light
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
is
not
going
to
break
the
bank
when
you
go
out
or
just
want
some
beer
around
the
house
the
taste
of
bud
light
is
goodwhile
the
smell
is
just
average
i
have
always
liked
the
texture
of
it
as
well
it
is
a
good
and
relieble
beer
this
is
among
my
top
3
favorite
weekend
beers
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
and
quite
enjoyable
to
drink
but
some
enthusiasts
would
think
this
beer
is
overdone
with
flavor
and
lacks
traditional
beer
qualities
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
when
you
want
to
go
out
an
have
fun
or
even
if
you
are
just
chilling
at
home
the
can
however
could
use
some
work
the
logo
is
simple
and
i
like
that
but
they
can
do
a
lot
more
to
improve
the
appearance
of
the
can
overall
this
is
a
very
boring
beer
i
o
people
kill
this
beer
but
it
is
what
it
is
an
extremely
cheap
beer
that
is
good
in
situations
where
you
want
something
consistent
and
reliable
not
a
great
beer
but
for
the
value
i
think
is
right
on
the
mark
o
i
know
a
lot
of
people
bash
this
because
its
an
inbev
product
but
realistically
this
is
one
of
the
best
light
lagers
you
will
find
ive
had
some
terrible
light
lagers
that
are
rated
far
higher
than
this
simply
because
they
are
from
another
brewery
easy
drinking
not
offensive
at
all
and
actually
has
some
flavor
which
is
rare
for
the
style
it
isnt
a
craft
beer
and
it
doesnt
pretend
to
be
a
craft
beer
you
can
do
much
worse
for
the
adjunct
style
overall
i
dont
hate
this
beer
i
just
dont
happen
to
like
it
very
much
it
can
be
said
however
to
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
when
served
cold
still
there
are
much
better
beers
in
the
cheapswill
class
which
do
a
better
job
under
those
circumstances
than
bud
light
the
taste
is
very
typical
of
an
adjunct
light
lager
like
this
with
a
pale
grainy
malts
and
a
clean
hop
finish
it
makes
sense
that
this
beer
is
popular
among
the
masses
as
a
craft
beer
it
is
weak
but
for
its
style
it
is
right
where
it
is
supposed
to
be
i
used
to
go
to
a
now
defunct
pizza
joint
in
greenville
n
c
they
had
this
on
tap
warm
for
1pitcher
no
flavor
no
nothing
i
am
no
aficionado
but
this
is
the
beer
of
college
students
and
people
who
hate
their
kidneys
avoid
at
all
costs
please
cheers
i
dont
get
all
the
hate
for
the
bmcs
on
this
site
did
everyone
start
out
drinking
craft
i
know
i
didnt
and
i
can
also
say
im
not
nor
will
i
ever
be
too
good
for
a
bud
i
feel
there
is
always
a
time
and
a
place
for
it
if
i
know
im
going
to
drink
all
day
like
tailgating
at
a
texans
game
im
going
to
bust
out
the
bud
rather
than
an
ipa
or
stout
im
not
even
going
to
break
down
this
review
and
tell
you
color
taste
ect
because
you
should
already
know
what
a
light
lager
tastes
like
in
my
opinion
this
site
is
more
about
learning
craftmicro
brews
that
you
possibly
cant
get
or
find
so
you
read
about
them
this
beer
is
too
easily
accessible
you
want
to
know
what
what
it
tastes
like
go
buy
one
o
yeah
like
everyone
here
knows
its
pretty
bad
theres
worse
much
worse
but
this
is
pretty
close
to
the
bottle
of
the
well
i
normally
refuse
this
just
not
me
overall
the
only
time
i
buy
this
beer
is
if
i
really
need
to
do
a
beer
batter
im
not
using
good
beer
for
that
other
than
that
if
given
the
choice
between
drink
bud
light
on
a
budget
or
not
drink
im
choosing
not
drink
every
time
avoid
just
had
the
family
bring
back
one
of
the
fancy
new
16
oz
alumibottles
neat
packaging
taste
is
the
same
overall
its
a
light
beer
theyre
all
about
the
same
smooth
and
refreshing
but
tasteless
if
you
like
beer
with
flavor
dont
bother
i
might
prefer
natural
light
haha
barely
a
step
above
weak
soda
water
in
fact
id
rather
drink
a
nice
cold
glass
of
ice
water
over
having
this
beer
i
wonder
what
the
budweiser
marketing
folks
mean
by
the
superior
drinkability
label
on
the
bottle
superior
to
plain
water
perhaps
there
is
a
low
alcohol
content
that
may
be
a
draw
over
plain
h2o
superior
to
drinking
a
flavorful
beer
no
way
one
of
the
primary
reasons
i
try
and
drink
so
many
beers
near
and
far
is
for
classic
beer
flavors
and
new
and
interesting
twists
which
so
many
creative
thinking
brewers
come
up
with
if
low
alcohol
and
barely
perceptible
taste
are
what
youre
looking
for
then
bud
light
is
the
beer
for
you
lets
face
it
this
beer
has
very
little
taste
more
like
flavored
water
and
is
marketed
for
girls
who
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
you
are
paying
for
the
name
and
marketing
if
you
paid
for
taste
this
stuff
would
be
almost
free
this
is
basically
an
image
beer
score
wise
this
is
as
low
as
ill
ever
go
without
giving
this
to
drain
because
as
much
as
i
dislike
it
it
is
very
drinkable
even
with
all
of
its
pusfilled
carbuncles
due
to
being
so
similar
to
carbonated
water
and
its
not
quite
as
terribad
as
bl
platinum
so
celebrate
those
two
merits
bud
light
because
thats
all
im
giving
you
tonight
note
i
review
for
the
style
i
refuse
to
let
my
prejudices
slant
any
review
nothing
worse
than
the
typical
beer
snob
reviewing
an
aal
same
for
your
aal
drinker
reviewing
a
craft
brew
it
is
really
hard
for
me
to
absolutely
hate
this
beer
having
pretty
much
drank
it
most
of
my
adult
life
but
now
having
tasted
so
many
excellent
and
shall
i
say
real
beers
this
one
is
definitely
at
the
bottom
for
me
taste
inoffensive
so
its
not
god
awful
but
it
drinks
like
a
glass
of
water
which
is
weird
a
beer
should

there
are

out
there

you

more
give

which
surprised
me
rating
this
for
the
style
of
beer
it
is
i
dont
think
its
bad
at
all
but
comparing
it
to
other
beers
in
general
i
would
choose
plenty
of
other
brews
before
this
one
overall
your
typical
adjunct
lager
what
can
i
say
d
well
its
bud
what
do
you
expect
kudos
to
the
beer
giants
in
st
louis
for
making
this
beer
last
so
long
it
will
be
here
for
years
to
come
i
would
take
a
miller
lite
over
this
any
day
keep
up
those
funny
commercials
though
i
havent
done
an
extensive
investigation
into
this
style
so
i
may
be
missing
some
nuances
here
really
cheap
lagers
from
honduras
and
india
seem
to
have
more
flavor
so
they
must
have
determined
that
less
flavor
is
what
theyre
after
but
it
does
seem
like
this
is
a
suggestion
of
beer
a
marketing
campaign
like
the
marlboro
man
we
all
know
about
bud
light
its
nothing
extraordinary
and
yet
its
nothing
undrinkable
there
is
little
to
no
smell
and
the
downside
to
this
is
that
there
is
also
little
to
no
taste
bud
light
is
basically
water
with
a
hint
of
beer
flavoring
i
guess
its
good
if
you
want
to
drink
in
excess
but
still
there
are
other
better
options
out
there
dont
get
me
wrong
i
drink
bud
light
on
occasion
but
it
is
nowhere
near
my
1st
choice
or
even
my
30th
choice
d
only
thing
to
do
with
this
is
drink
it
fast
and
cold
nothing
going
on
here
but
some
bubbly
refreshment
double
boo
o
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
still
not
one
i
would
turn
to
if
i
was
looking
for
a
tasty
beer
and
you
have
to
drink
it
fast
before
it
warms
up
because
once
it
does
you
might
as
well
dump
it
down
the
drain
pours
a
pale

drinkability
decently
drinkable
but
id
prefer
water
its
not
unpleasant
or
offensive
nor
harsh
or
chemically
its
just
not
very
good
pass
on
this
one
vic
youre
an
ahole
for
sending
this
im
sure
your
fridge
is
stocked
full
of
it
i
hope
all
your
relatives
buy
you
a
case
of
this
for
christmas
possibly
the
best
beer
one
can
obtain
in
college
perfect
to
get
faced
with
as
the
hangover
is
not
as
bad
as
miller
or
coors
again
the
pour
is
fizzy
yellow
water
the
taste
is
more
watered
down
corn
and
rice
but
with
extra
corn
syrup
doable
not
preferable
why
do
we
even
do
this
to
ourselves
this
is
what
we
are
rising
up
against
but
this
is
the
optimal
light
american
lager
meant
to
be
conumed
in
great
amounts
while
building
a
tree
house
watching
a
baseball
game
or
playing
a
softball
game
its
good
for
what
it
is
but
what
it
is
is
not
good
its
like
a
bad
handjob
ypu
gotta
appreciate
what
happening
but
tis
pretty
awful
and
you
just
want
it
over
with
served
in
a
can
one
of
the
most
popular
if
not
the
most
popular
beer
in
america
while
light
lagers
arent
exactly
my
favorite
beer
bud
light
isnt
bad
its
the
ideal
definition
of
a
watered
down
beer
doesnt
really
have
much
of
a
taste
to
it
itll
get
you
drunk
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
for
the
taste
i
prefer
this
over
miller
light
coors
light
and
budweiser
definitely
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
large
quantities
and
definitely
much
better
than
the
keystone
and
nattys
of
the
world
this
beer
is
one
of
beers
that
reminds
me
as
to
why
when
i
got
older
i
promised
myself
that
i
would
drink
better
beer
we
got
a
pitcher
as
the
others
didnt
want
bud
which
i
would
have
preferred
poured
half
a
cup
and
proceeded
to
slow
drink
the
thing
all
night
as
i
could
barely
stomach
it
it
was
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
huge
head
that
was
gone
in
15
seconds
or
less
it
had
a
faint
grainy
smell
to
it
same
with
the
taste
no
real
flavor
to
it
like
i
said
i
could
only
handle
half
a
cup
stay
away
i
think
this
is
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
in
high
school
used
to
drink
these
all
the
time
and
thought
they
were
the
best
thing
ever
now
im
still
only
in
college
and
i
usually
avoid
it
i
get
it
now
from
time
to
time
on
tap
or
if
its
on
sale
but
i
have
found
that
there
are
much
better
alternatives
this
is
a
partytailgatingbeer
pong
beer
and
not
much
more
and
i
would
personally
choose
natty
light
for
those
just
because
its
cheaper
and
honestly
less
watered
down
tasting
and
a
better
tasting
beer
bud
light
is
not
really
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
that
good
overall
sounds
pretty
good
doesnt
itif
your
a
thirsty
robot
but
the
funny
thing
is
millions
of
folks
love
this
stuff
but
then
again
millions
of
people
like
diet
pepsi
too
better
than
millers
light
beer
but
i
prefer
coors
if
we
are
talking
about
the
big
3
well
it
sure
goes
down
like
um
you
guessed
it
i
cant
fault
this
for
tasting
bad
as
it
really
is
the
picture
of
flavour
neutrality
like
too
many
other
widely
available
products
that
i
will
refrain
from
naming
here
what
i
cant
seem
to
grok
is
drinking
a
case
of
these
over
an
evenings
activities
id
much
prefer
a
few
wellmade
strong
drinks
with
unadulterated
water
in
between
one
day
ill
get
my
old
man
to
try
something
different
one
day
a
light
amber
color
almost
too
pale
that
appears
clear
a
light
head
with
little
if
no
lacing
weak
lager
flavor
that
is
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
light
crisp
mouthfeel
and
is
a
little
too
carbonated
overall
a
beer
the
might
be
good
for
getting
drunk
but
not
too
quickly
not
a
beer
too
enjoy
for
flavor
would
not
recommend
drinkability
is
low
you
could
argue
sessionability
because
of
low
alc
etc
but
i
cant
see
drinking
these
in
bulk
anymore
unless
im
trying
to
get
hammered
theres
more
flavorful
ways
to
do
that
anyway
so
i
think
next
time
ill
leave
bud
light
on
the
shelves
the
mouthfeel
is
bad
and
the
drinability
is
as
poor
as
any
beverage
alcoholic
or
not
as
i
have
ever
tasted
d
i
suppose
ice
cold
this
beer
will
work
for
me
it
is
instant
headache
if
i
consume
more
than
two
a
real
frowzy
beer
for
the
money
i
can
hit
the
strohs
high
life
or
pbr
and
get
a
winner
sorry
bud
i
really
dont
recomend
this
beer
this
beer
is
absolutely
horrible
i
will
never
place
this
beer
in
my
mouth
again
the
color
is
like
piss
and
the
taste
is
not
much
far
removed
the
carbonation
and
corn
flavanols
give
this
beer
a
horrible
beginning
middle
and
disguisting
after
taste
that
was
only
ended
by
my
samuel
adams
boston
ale
d
better
than
regular
bud
at
least
i
can
tolerate
bud
light
i
drink
this
beer
to
get
wasted
theres
no
other
good
purpose
for
it
drinkability
better
than
water
but
not
my
preference
i
know
it
is
easy
to
risk
ones
beerness
status
when
giving
a
budget
beer
anything
over
a
2
0
but
honestly
i
believe
the
ab
got
it
right
with
their
new
commercial
campaign
the
difference
is
drinkability
and
bud
light
has
it
unlike
miller
lite
which
needs
to
be
numbingly
cold
bl
can
actually
move
to
the
not
freezing
side
and
still
be
pretty
good
everyone
needs
a
good
budget
beer
for
me
bl
provides
that
its
a
light
straw
yellow
it
smells
like
nothing
and
a
tiny
touch
of
ironish
metallic
it
tastes
like
it
was
made
with
unsweetened
cornflakeswhich
is
not
necessarily
horrible
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
it
feels
decent
in
my
mouth
and
i
could
drink
them
one
after
another
but
if
i
was
going
to
do
that
i
would
drink
a
session
lager
its
only
20
more
calories
and
its
about
20
times
better
golden
transparent
hue
with
frothy
head
almost
no
aroma
whatsoever
that
i
can
determine
tastes
almost
as
bland
as
the
aroma
but
a
few
hop
flavors
show
through
as
well
as
some
grains
this
is
the
most
watered
down
beer
i
have
had
among
the
millercoors
and
anheuserbusch
companies
drinkability
very
easy
goes
down
easier
than
water
good
for
drinking
games
d
well
its
certainly
inoffensive
at
least
in
the
sense
that
it
contains
absolutely
zero
off
flavors
or
flavors
of
any
sort
actually
it
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
thats
about
the
only
use
for
this
beer
very
pale
colored
beer
with
a
very
rapidly
fading
head
taste
like
all
ab
products
are
fresh
and
smooth
another
light
lager
that
is
refreshing
and
made
for
those
hot
summer
days
this
is
something
ill
always
purchase
no
matter
how
many
new
beers
come
out
on
the
market
little
lit
of
grain
and
some
citrusy
notes
too
other
than
than
this
is
a
pretty
bland
light
beer
little
to
no
head
retention
and
the
aroma
is
only
noticeable
from
about
an
inch
away
given
it
is
a
light
beer
so
i
cant
bash
it
too
much
i
guess
its
alright
for
a
beer
in
this
category
nothing
special
but
not
a
terrible
choice
d
for
light
lagers
id
far
rather
go
with
miller
lite
as
it
has
more
character
by
far
this
is
ok
but
not
even
decent
d
easily
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
there
are
no
bad
flavors
to
slow
you
down
in
fact
there
arent
really
any
flavors
to
get
in
the
way
do
as
others
have
opined
this
is
more
like
a
beerflavored
beverage
waterclub
sodaseltzer
than
an
actual
beer
i
guess
for
what
ab
is
trying
to
do
with
it
it
hits
the
mark
but
there
are
certainly
better
light
lager
options
out
there
if
thats
your
thing
at
least
the
phillies
bottle
will
look
good
on
my
shelf
this
was
probably
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
tried
its
cheap
and
really
at
that
age
i
didnt
know
any
better
the
color
is
a
pale
yellow
and
pours
out
initially
with
a
moderate
amount
of
foam
which
completely
dissipates
into
nothing
it
has
a
very
bland
taste
to
it
almost
completely
like
water
a
lot
of
carbonation
truly
its
the
beer
to
drink
when
all
you
want
to
do
is
get
drunk
and
even
then
it
will
take
far
too
many
than
i
care
to
spend
my
money
on
d
drinkability
was
bad
very
corny
flavor
with
green
stalks
and
a
high
carbonation
factor
all
which
leads
to
a
big
fizzy
disappointment
will
make
your
grimace
with
every
sip
and
consider
pouring
it
down
the
drain
notes
i
went
to
college
in
st
louis
slu
and
so
there
was
a
time
when
bud
and
therefore
bud
light
was
my
hometown
beer
man
i
wasted
a
lot
of
tastetime
on
them
bud
light
is
a
solid
choice
in
its
category
in
my
opinion
nothing
about
the
beer
is
particularly
exceptional
the
look
is
pale
yellow
it
poors
very
average
with
little
head
and
the
taste
is
very
bland
and
unnoticable
but
in
each
of
these
categories
it
rises
above
other
brands
of
similar
style
like
coors
light
miller
etc
and
it
seems
to
have
more
flavor
than
its
counterparts
a
really
genuinely
bad
beer
but
not
really
any
worse
than
anything
else
of
this
style
its
not
so
much
offensive
as
it
is
tasteless
what
more
can
be
said
about
this
for
what
it
is
which
is
a
social
party
beer
it
does
its
job
certainly
my
only
gripe
with
it
is
that
its
basically
the
same
price
as
micros
yet
people
still
insist
on
getting
this
a
30
pack
taxdeposit
will
run
you
like
22
if
you
want
cheap
beer
you
can
get
natty
light
or
gennesse
among
others
for
about
half
the
price
and
they
taste
the
same
end
of
story
d
better
than
regular
bud
at
least
i
can
tolerate
bud
light
i
can
actually
finish
a
can
without
feeling
the
need
to
go
throw
up
just
happy
to
be
done
with
it
nutty
thing
about
this
one
is
that
you
see
people
buying
30
packs
of
this
or
other
lite
macros
i
just
dont
get
it
taste
was
too
light
to
be
enjoyable
good
for
getting
drunk
but
tough
to
actually
enjoy
for
the
taste
overall
dear
bud
light
its
over
dont
call
dont
write
this
didnt
taste
horrible
until
i
really
sat
down
and
thought
about
it
cant
choke
this
down
unless
nearly
frozen
no
bmc
bashing
here
this
really
isnt
good
at
all
its
better
than
budweiser
which
i
never
could
drink
a
barely
drinkable
mass
produced
pale
lager
that
only
has
a
little
bit
of
a
foul
taste
to
go
along
with
the
watery
sweet
corn
grainy
malty
mixture
i
dont
hate
bud
light
but
that
may
be
because
the
bud
light
commercials
are
at
least
funny
once
again
made
for
mass
consumption
and
not
the
enjoyment
of
tasting
beer
i
am
drinking
only
for
the
purpose
of
reviewing
looks
a
little
less
interesting
than
a
typical
macro
lager
light
yellow
with
barely
a
sizzle
of
foam
smells
like
the
urinals
at
a
football
game
tastes
like
watered
down
stale
grain
too
thin
and
lightly
carbonated
to
feel
much
of
anything
but
regret
even
using
this
in
a
beer
funnel
is
shameful
completely
refraining
from
hyperbole
this
is
the
worst
beer
ever
created
by
man
tastes
of
light
malt
and
rice
and
rather
highly
carbonated
yet
typically
cloaking
of
the
style
surely
better
in
a
glass
than
via
the
bottle
not
sure
i
can
say
that
for
many
an
amerian
macrobrew
unfortunately
this
was
my
first
beer
and
i
almost
swore
away
all
of
beers
goodness
because
if
all
beer
tasted
like
this
i
couldnt
handle
it
i
would
probably
be
thinner
and
have
more
money
but
i
wouldnt
be
happy
p
i
can
drink
a
12
pack
of
these
and
not
suffer
any
ill
effects
i
prefer
better
beer
but
when
im
slumming
it
which
is
quite
frequently
as
of
late
im
not
too
proud
to
buy
some
bud
light
it
doesnt
taste
bad
and
if
i
drink
enough
it
gets
me
where
i
want
to
be
i
am
not
here
to
defend
one
of
the
biggest
selling
beers
on
the
planet
but
understand
the
context
for
having
a
beer
like
this
i
think
that
this
is
why
bud
light
is
such
a
huge
seller
lay
people
nonbas
just
want
to
drink
something
cold
that
gives
them
a
buzz
and
this
is
what
bud
light
bottles
are
all
about
well
ive
put
rating
this
one
off
for
a
long
time
truth
is
i
havent
had
one
since
i
started
rating
beers
downed
a
handful
of
these
this
morning
during
a
golf
scramble
no
great
or
even
good
redeeming
qualities
another
light
beer
that
will
only
give
you
a
headache
poured
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
aroma
was
cereal
grains
with
a
slight
hint
of
malt
and
hops
taste
was
cereal
grains
but
for
an
light
lager
i
caught
some
hops
and
malt
thin
a
little
more
water
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
not
much
flavor
but
you
could
pound
a
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
taste
is
watery
with
a
flat
note
of
wet
bran
cereal
and
a
tang
of
sour
spent
grain
at
approximately
22
ounces
remaining
of
the
original
24
bud
light
proved
my
most
voluminous
drainpour
to
date
i
hate
to
play
pile
on
drinkability
is
this
a
joke
i
just
had
one
of
these
at
a
baseball
game
where
it
was
the
only
beer
available
i
was
glad
to
have
something
to
quench
my
thirst
like
other
american
light
pilsnerstyle
lagers
the
color
is
very
pale
and
the
flavor
is
difficult
to
detect
very
little
head
or
body
but
hey
at
a
hot
texas
ballpark
in
july
it
does
help
you
beat
the
heat
without
adding
too
many
calories
to
your
belly
budget
d
i
had
a
few
since
i
was
thirsty
and
they
were
free
i
shut
myself
off
after
3
i
just
couldnt
do
it
anymore
mouthfeel
is
crisp
highly
carbonated
everything
is
way
too
light
for
my
tastes
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
minimal
white
head
the
smell
is
not
complex
and
all
and
just
reminds
me
of
drinking
cheap
beer
the
taste
is
very
slight
with
the
mildest
flavor
of
nuts
with
no
hop
taste
all
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
mean
its
not
the
greatest
tasting
beer
but
its
not
uncomfortable
in
my
mouth
i
must
admit
it
is
a
beer
i
drink
after
i
am
buzzed
purely
for
monetary
reasons
cant
justify
to
myself
drinking
quality
beer
when
i
am
not
there
enough
to
enjoy
it
like
many
i
drank
a
bud
light
because
it
was
the
only
choice
at
a
gathering
there
is
really
nothing
to
be
said
for
this
bland
brew
it
completely
lacks
any
presence
or
complexity
bl
tastes
faintly
beerlike
but
definitely
not
malty
or
hoppy
although
there
is
a
cold
wellcarbonated
crispness
its
sad
that
bl
reflects
the
quintessential
american
beer
taste
this
beer
is
thin
watery
has
barely
any
smell
and
i
cant
even
describe
the
flavor
because
this
beer
makes
me
literally
gag
so
i
guess
you
could
say
the
aftertaste
of
this
beer
is
vomit
i
wish
i
could
give
it
a
zero
on
taste
and
drinkability
i
dont
understand
how
my
friends
can
chug
these
by
the
bucket
at
a
bar
overall
an
unimpressive
brew
good
for
washing
food
down
on
a
hot
day
best
thing
to
say
is
it
could
be
worse
this
beer
gets
the
job
done
but
its
not
worth
the
damage
to
my
liver
to
drink
it
in
my
opinion
its
one
of
the
worst
beers
in
the
world
its
drinkable
with
some
salt
and
a
lime
and
also
if
ice
cold
and
in
a
beer
bong
at
a
college
party
drinkability
the
best
just
pop
the
top
and
drink
smooth
nothing
offensive
left
in
your
mouth
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
with
any
regularity
whatsoever
but
it
makes
a
pretty
drinkable
camping
beer
smell
aside
not
a
bad
macro
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
that
bl
mite
be
my
favorite
macro
when
i
cannot
afford
good
beer
i
always
end
up
running
to
the
supermarket
and
grab
these
also
since
alot
of
my
friends
dont
drink
good
beer
they
usually
buy
this
it
is
good
for
bbqs
the
beach
and
parties
because
its
cheap
and
plentiful
d
avoid
at
all
cost
no
redeeming
features
of
this
product
as
stated
before
i
can
drink
the
worse
water
and
have
no
problem
but
this
stuff
makes
me
cringe
its
horrible
the
only
time
i
enjoyed
this
is
when
i
won
it
a
serious
game
of
texas
hold
em
other
than
that
its
not
on
my
list
of
beers
to
get
someone
bought
a
bottle
of
this
for
my
birthday
and
how
can
you
turn
that
down
might
as
well
review
this
beer
considering
i
drank
about
a
million
of
these
in
college
so
many
years
ago
unimpressive
appearance
pale
yellow
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
taste
is
actually
tolerable
some
grain
and
a
hint
of
crisp
malt
flavor
until
it
warms
up
that
is
at
that
point
things
go
south
and
its
pretty
bad
gotta
drink
this
beer
cold
thats
for
sure
this
was
definitely
the
first
beer
that
i
had
ever
tasted
a
long
time
a
go
and
the
only
reason
why
im
reviewing
it
and
didnt
think
i
could
finish
it
last
night
while
at
a
birthday
party
i
tried
to
actually
analyze
the
flavors
instead
of
mindlessly
downing
it
and
found
that
it
had
light
cereal
grain
first
time
i
detected
cereal
grain
and
could
recognize
it
corn
slightly
metallic
even
from
a
bottle
and
undoubtedly
there
must
be
rice
involved
the
abv
has
to
come
from
somewhere
barely
any
hop
presence
this
stuff
is
bubbly
and
watery
and
hopefully
cold
miller
light
probably
has
more
of
a
pilsner
light
barley
malt
taste
in
it
but
it
still
doesnt
make
it
much
better
it
has
a
strange
afterbite
in
it
that
i
cannot
pinpoint
this
is
soda
water
with
a
drop
of
bad
tasting
beer
in
it
yet
it
is
drinkable
because
of
how
nonexistent
it
is
i
gave
it
a
3
5
for
drink
so
if
youre
drinkingchugging
as
fast
as
you
can
you
can
catch
a
buzz
compared
to
coors
light
or
even
regular
coors
it
looks
tastes
and
feels
better
so
i
ran
out
of
sierra
nevada
at
my
sisters
graduation
party
and
had
to
switch
to
these
ugh
peeyellow
light
carbonation
impressive
head
for
what
it
is
smells
faintly
of
corn
and
malts
taste
is
completely
watered
down
so
watered
down
in
fact
i
added
some
lemonade
to
it
and
created
a
shandy
which
made
it
taste
like
watered
down
lemonade
not
a
good
beer
by
any
means
um
i
dont
really
know
what
to
say
its
not
good
okay
i
mean
its
really
terrible
it
looks
like
peepee
and
it
smells
like
corn
and
maybe
some
slight
sweet
malt
the
nose
and
flavor
are
incredibly
weak
maltiness
with
absolutely
no
hops
as
in
i
dont
think
they
actually
use
hops
in
this
beer
sad
but
true
feel
is
thin
and
weak
i
dunno
it
gets
you
drunk
but
its
truly
awful
d
not
again
d
the
bud
light
was
easy
to
drink
and
since
i
found
that
it
wasnt
lacking
in
character
i
could
have
another
if
light
beer
was
something
i
wanted
in
my
life
i
might
pick
this
one
up
again
for
a
light
beer
expirience
that
provides
low
calories
with
exceptional
flavor
and
drinkability
sam
adams
light
does
the
trick
well
it
is
no
wonder
the
rest
of
the
world
shames
our
beer
drinking
palate
when
this
crap
brew
is
the
number
one
seller
in
america
this
is
the
beer
that
most
of
my
friends
routinely
drink
and
im
not
so
sure
why
its
weak
it
smells
awful
and
it
goes
down
like
yellow
water
if
you
know
what
i
mean
never
retains
head
minimal
lacing
bad
taste
bad
smell
theres
really
nothing
redeemable
about
this
beer
at
all
very
very
very
average
beer
if
your
intentions
are
to
consume
as
much
fermented
grain
as
possible
than
this
is
ok
but
other
than
that
find
a
better
beer
poured
in
american
pint
glass
almost
complete
lack
of
head
but
some
lacing
did
remain
translucent
yellow
color
eerily
similar
to
urine
very
effervescent
and
this
showed
through
in
the
taste
bright
flavour
very
active
but
without
substance
watery
mouthfeel
the
taste
disappeared
almost
midway
through
although
a
bit
of
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
surfaced
i
remember
some
good
times
with
this
beer
but
find
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
half
of
one
now
and
youll
be
right
bud
light
is
simultaneously
abs
most
popular
product
and
one
of
its
worst
budweiser
on
the
other
hand
is
actually
not
too
bad
i
tried
this
beer
for
the
first
time
ever
on
april
14
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
pours
a
very
translucent
pale
yellow
almost
clear
with
yellow
food
colouring
added
to
give
it
a
tinge
of
colour
the
aroma
is
weakly
malty
with
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
watery
with
little
carbonation
the
flavour
was
watery
as
well
again
water
with
a
little
bit
of
artificial
beer
taste
added
i
have
to
admit
while
there
was
nothing
spectacular
about
this
beer
it
went
down
very
fast
p
s
i
dont
like
light
beers
a
pale
staw
color
with
a
tan
head
the
mell
is
of
old
hops
and
some
malt
syrup
the
taste
is
similar
not
much
different
than
water
sparkling
yellow
water
that
is
bitter
is
the
main
component
body
is
light
with
a
heavy
carbonation
not
the
most
drinkable
light
beer
good
for
cooking
perhaps
pairs
well
with
a
nascar
race
this
used
to
be
the
beer
of
choice
when
i
was
under
21
but
ive
found
that
bud
light
steered
me
away
from
beer
in
general
for
quite
a
while
im
only
drinking
this
one
because
a
buddy
left
some
over
here
one
night
with
this
being
a
lot
of
peoples
idea
of
beer
its
no
wonder
hardly
anyone
understands
the
beverage

it
is
the
drinkability
that
makes
it
so
good

i

5drinkability
if
my
goal
is
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
beer
is
the
beer
craftsmanship
of
anheuserbusch
in
the
world
of
brewing
it
serves
that
purpose
still
i
drink
this
crap
to
sober
up
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
lage
bubbles
and
no
head
the
aroma
is
better
than
the
flavor
i
actually
smell
some
malt
the
flavor
is
quite
subtle
with
water
and
co2
bubbles
dominating
very
light
on
the
pallette
what
more
is
there
to
say
to
reach
the
250
character
minimum
drinkability
yes
you
can
pound
this
out
but
youll
feel
sick
the
next
day
and
be
kicking
yourself
for
it
when
we
are
young
and
foolish
this
drink
is
great
when
you
begin
trying
new
drinks
you
realize
how
crappy
this
really
is
do
not
want
this
beer
pours
a
straw
colored
wait
a
minute
pour
bud
light
from
a
can
hah
i
drank
this
on
the
golf
course
quickly
as
possible
since
it
was
so
hot
yesterday
it
appears
to
be
yellow
food
colored
water
smell
is
almost
non
existent
in
the
taste
i
sense
corn
a
little
hops
and
mostly
water
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
more
forgivable
as
it
is
a
crisp
carbonated
refreshing
drink
on
a
summer
day
outside
overall
seriously
why
bother
im
not
just
being
mean
if
your
just
trying
to
get
hammered
drink
a
few
shots
or
something
maybe
drink
one
of
those
flavored
malt
beverages
at
least
it
has
some
flavor
thats
it
for
the
big
3
thank
god
i
swear
without
the
bottles
id
never
be
able
to
tell
them
apart
that
said
ive
had
worse
d
i
caught
this
beer
on
sale
and
thought
i
would
give
it
a
shot
i
bought
it
and
i
will
drink
it
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
if
i
wanted
a
cheap
beer
and
caught
it
on
sale
i
still
would
have
second
thoughts
about
buying
it
i
have
to
admit
i
went
along
time
thinking
this
was
a
prime
lager
example
now
that
i
finally
have
learned
about
real
beer
this
stuff
is
horrible
d
despite
its
lack
of
flavor
and
character
this
beer
is
near
ultimate
drinkability
on
a
hot
day
if
you
like
drinking
half
beer
half
water
the
best
choice
if
youre
having
a
party
and
providing
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
no
head
retention
or
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
has
a
very
light
aroma
to
it
smells
like
malted
corn
and
rice
corn
and
rice
also
the
main
part
of
the
taste
with
little
hops
character
very
light
and
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
too
light
little
taste
even
considering
the
style
there
are
much
better
beers
as
im
sure
most
people
realize
since
theyve
probably
had
this
beer
and
i
give
credit
to
the
people
at
anheuserbusch
they
aim
to
make
a
product
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
and
indeed
theyve
succeeded
light
beer
was
introduced
in
the
1970s
as
a
marketing
attempt
at
expanding
their
demographic
to
women
and
healthconscientious
people
to
appeal
to
a
wider
market
they
needed
to
make
a
wider
appealing
product
and
did
so
by
introducing
a
product
with
less
flavour
less
aroma
less
alcohol
who
doesnt
drink
water
this
is
something
else
d
yuck
made
to
be
drunk
as
fast
as
possible
and
puked
up
later
absolutely
awful
drinkable
if
nothing
else
it
is
drinkable
however
with
such
a
weak
taste
there
is
little
reason
to
want
to
drink
it
pours
a
clear
bland
yellow
color
with
a
nice
head
aroma
is
of
light
corn
or
rice
whichever
it
is
and
seems
sweet
taste
is
very
sweet
as
well
and
again
cornish
or
rice
taste
which
is
unimpressive
overall
beer
is
inoffensive
but
i
didnt
see
much
that
could
differentiate
it
from
other
light
lagers
boring
this
is
a
great
beer
for
beer
pong
since
it
is
cheap
and
much
easier
to
chug
than
some
of
the
other
macro
lackluster
beers
nothing
good
to
say
so
i
will
keep
it
short
and
sweet
this
is
your
typical
macro
no
head
no
lace
extremely
bland
on
the
nose
and
the
tongue
i
would
only
drink
if
there
was
no
other
option
thankfully
there
are
lots
of
options
i
dont
even
know
why
i
bothered
pouring
in
a
glass
should
have
used
a
funnel
i
wrote
this
down
in
a
notebook
3
years
ago
i
was
only
18
i
am
not
full
of
myself
but
there
aint
to
many
18
year
olds
who
would
have
preferred
a
trappist
beer
over
this
finish
has
the
faintest
hint
of
hops
over
carbonated
this
is
the
definition
of
a
tasteless
watered
down
macro
theres
almost
nothing
to
describe
suffers
as
it
warms
arent
most
beers
supposed
to
do
the
opposite
why
anyone
would
pay
35
more
for
this
over
mhl
i
have
no
earthly
idea
d
cheap
macro
light
beer
not
surprisingly
lacking
in
any
good
qualities
but
at
least
it
goes
down
easily
as
it
is
basically
water
drinkability
not
much
taste
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
water
at
least
it
was
free
or
else
id
feel
like
i
really
wasted
my
money
drinkability
could
drink
this
all
day
but
there
are
much
better
choices
one
thing
i
will
say
in
favor
of
this
beer
is
that
you
can
drink
it
if
nothing
else
is
available
its
not
a
beer
i
absolutely
cant
stand
to
drink
its
just
not
something
id
choose
to
drink
for
me
i
pick
the
bud
light
because
nothing
does
the
trick
on
a
hot
day

di
guess
people
drink
heineken
because
at

skunk
tastes
like
something
this
doesnt
taste
like
beer
maybe
watered
down
beer
once
again
i
am
bored
at
the
airport
my
assumption
as
to
why
people
drink
this
people
dont
like
the
taste
of
malt
or
hops
d
i
only
give
this
beer
a
1
5
because
i
imagine
the
tap
line
was
a
bit
old
and
imparted
a
hex
on
the
beer
that
made
it
worse
than
it
should
have
been
still
a
terrible
experience
here
overall
a
rather
flavorless
experience
no
really
offensive
flavors
or
aromas
just
nothing
really
worth
drinking
this
is
almost
a
no
beer

only
because

was
the
recipe
i
thought
this
is
what
a
beer
would
taste
like
if
you
took
really
cold
carbonated
water
and
then
used
an
eye

and
dropped
in
a
few
drops
of

good
refreshing
beer
not
much
flavor
smell
and
not
the
best
looking
beer
but
it
quenches
my
thirst
on
hot
south
texas
days
the
drinkability
is
awsome
not
very
hard
at
all
to
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
depechemode1983sep
26
that
being
said
this
is
my
brothers
most
frequently
purchased
beer
bud
light
was
very
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
disappeared
very
quickly
the
taste
and
smell
were
nearly
nonexistant
the
finish
is
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
watery
nearly
tastless
fizzy
beverage
but
i
guess
thats
what
its
designed
to
be
avoid
absoluetly
discusting
i
dont
know
how
you
can
drink
this
panther
piss
after
drinking
so
many
top
notch
brew
bud
lightbudweiser
needs
to
get
a
clue
i
know
they
sell
to
the
mass
but
what
a
tasteless
brew
no
dominate
scent
very
light
in
appearence
and
alot
of
carbonation
which
leaves
me
full
ill
stick
to
water
next
time
bud
light
is
being
served
get
my
buzz
on
n
i
recently
reviewed
this
beer
with
a
rambling
tirade
and
todd
called
me
on
it
it
was
too
soon
after
being
forced
to
drink
it
i
have
composed
myself
since
i
hadnt
had
the
displeasure
of
sampling
this
junk
for
many
years
but
was
relegated
to
during
a
football
tailgate
this
past
weekend
never
again
a
very
pale
urinestraw
colored
with
low
carbonation
and
no
head
s
watery
yeasty
corn
t
what
taste
it
is
an
attempt
at
beer
flavored
water
m
thin
but
no
worse
than
any
other
macro
light
lager
d
i
unlike
an
alarming
number
of
beer
drinking
americans
find
this
stuff
undrinkable
you
get
nothing
from
this
that
you
drink
beer
for
taste
not
withstanding
a
fermented
beverage
that
is
derived
from
malted
barley
and
hops
need
only
yield
5
alcohol
to
be
technically
classified
as
beer
bud
light
cant
have
much
more
than
that
and
even
less
taste
its
sad
when
something
makes
coors
or
miller
lite
seem
flavorful
relatively
speaking
thanks
todd
from
the
kinder
gentler
veech
heartless
gutless
taste
with
just
the
husk
of
flavor
in
a
watery
mess
mouthfeel
is
awol
boy
this
is
just
as
bad
as
i
remember
tell
me
again
why
this
beer
is
the
most
popular
by
volume
in
the
entirety
of
the
states
eric
this
isnt
the
worst
light
beer
available
in
this
area
but
its
far
from
the
best
given
a
choice
of
mass
produced
light
lagers
this
would
probably
be
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
i
can
think
of
at
least
two
or
three
brewed
by
major
companies
including
anheuserbusch
that
are
more
enjoyable
its
somewhat
embarrassing
this
is
the
1
selling
beer
in
america
i
hope
the
europeans
dont
take
notice
of
this
fact
drinkability
is
actually
good
i
say
this
because
for
its
style
even
though
it
is
not
complex
in
the
slightest
and
it
is
very
watery
there
is
no
skunk
or
cheap
malt
taste
pours
a
sickeningly
bright
but
translucent
hue
of
yellow
almost
like
some
champagne
head
seemed
good
at
first
but
lost
its
mojo
pretty
fast
smells
like
a
kegger
actually
its
not
an
entirely
unpleasing
smell
in
small
doses
but
it
certainly
doesnt
smell
like
a
hearty
delicious
brew
tastes
like
stale
bread
after
first
taste
the
nose
becomes
almost
undetectable
citrus
quality
is
observed
aftertaste
is
most
unpleasant
also
its
a
very
watery
brew
not
sure
if
this
is
a
legitimately
observed
taste
or
not
but
a
flavor
of
bile
was
definitely
noted
in
the
back
of
the
throat
it
made
me
scrunch
up
my
face
with
the
first
taste
perhaps
im
just
recalling
youthful
nights
of
overindulgence
dont
drink
beers
like
this
i
had
this
in
the
new
aluminum
bottle
that
seems
to
be
the
new
selling
point
for
ab
on
a
hot
day
at
the
byron
nelson
pga
tournament
this
hit
the
spot
stayed
cold
that
thick
shell
showed
its
purpose
i
felt
real
guilty
about
throwing
this
out
because
it
is
such
a
waste
make
sure
you
recycle
these
bottles
far
from
being
a
great
product
bud
light
is
a
versatile
beer
that
most
anyone
will
find
acceptable
i
generally
dont
go
for
light
beers
but
among
the
macro
lights
bud
light
ranks
as
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
also
one
of
the
few
light
beers
that
i
like
better
than
the
regular
beer
it
is
what
you
come
to
expect
from
a
bmc
product
average
across
the
board
the
appearance
was
a
very
light
yellow
there
was
no
smell
present
the
drink
ability
is
the
only
positive
thing
about
this
beer
because
it
seems
very
easy
to
down
a
couple
overall
i
would
not
buy
this
again
the
only
time
i
might
accept
this
is
if
its
free
drinkability
you
can
put
these
back
about
as
fast
as
you
can
put
back
a
little
bottle
of
soda
water
thats
pretty
much
what
it
is
anyway
salud
it
has
hardly
any
taste
and
the
taste
it
does
have
reminds
me
of
water
water
from
boston
harbor
it
has
a
boring
yellow
color
its
a
decent
beer
if
youre
with
friends
who
arent
beer
drinkers
and
just
want
to
get
tipsy
otherwise
id
never
order
this
at
a
bar
or
buy
a
6
pack
drinkability
as
bad
as
it
gets
drinking
one
is
very
very
trying
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
light
head
the
beer
smells
pungent
and
almost
fruit
like
the
taste
is
sweet
and
it
hits
you
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
it
has
a
crisp
feel
with
little
aftertaste
over
all
the
drinkability
is
fine
but
this
beer
doesnt
offer
much
the
smell
and
appearance
are
still
the
same
as
if
i
was
drinking
out
of
a
40
oz
but
the
taste
actually
had
some
nice
hop
character
to
it
and
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
better
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
and
the
taste
lacks
the
original
sourness
which
made
it
easy
to
pound
down
two
pitchers
before
getting
cut
off
by
my
aunt
bottom
line
just
another
shitty
american
macro
light
lager
king
of
beers
i
think
they
should
be
sued
for
saying
that
just
my
opinion
ta
ta
this
beer
has
a
yellow
bubbling
tint
to
it
that
leaves
no
head
whatsoever
smell
is
of
i
cant
really
decide
i
think
it
smells
like
water
flavored
corn
taste
is
almost
nonexistent
i
couldnt
even
finish
the
whole
thing
without
dumping
it
down
the
drain
avoid
this
at
all
costs
cheers
this
is
as
drinkable
as
tap
water
its
not
as
offensive
as
some
other
light
beers
ive
tried
but
it
lacks
any
real
beer
flavor
or
character
this
is
another
failed
attempt
at
making
a
light
beer
that
tastes
like
beer
ive
had
lowalcohol
beer
that
tastes
more
like
beer
yeah
it
isnt
bad
just
terribly
boring
if
i
wanted
the
same
sort
of
experience
but
good
id
hit
up
a
helles
i
can
see
where
they
were
going
with
this
beer
but
man
just
not
that
well
executed
the
number
one
beer
in
america
so
good
that
according
to
the
tv
ads
people
will
arange
thier
lives
around
it
hardly
youll
do
better
with
a
busch
light
from
the
same
folks
in
st
louis
mo
overall
a
beer
i
dont
know
why
i
am
reviewing
must
be
drunk
in
all
honesty
its
not
a
horrible
thing
to
drink
just
a
horrible
beer
to
save
money
i
say
buy
bud
dry
if
you
want
ab
or
just
get
something
cheaper
this
shit
aint
worth
it
d
not
sure
if
this
wasnt
a
good
keg
or
not
but
if
the
rest
is
like
this
it
is
purely
undrinkable
how
can
this
be
so
different
than
the
bottle
reminds
me
of
high
school
drinking
whatever
alcohol
we
could
get
our
hands
on
oh
many
years
went
by
when
we
drank
this
type
of
beer
busch
or
bud
light
just
in
order
to
get
inebriated
enough
to
make
some
bad
decisions
kinda
depressing
that
legal
adults
still
drink
the
same
pisswater
just
to
get
drunk
clear
pale
yellow
grainy
aroma
and
not
much
else
nearly
nothing
for
complexity
and
the
mouthfeel
is
so
ridiculously
light
im
convinced
that
this
beer
is
engineered
for
frat
houses
and
nothing
more
12
oz
can
it
is
clear
yellow
color
that
is
highly
carbonated
it
smells
of
alcohol
and
faintly
of
corn
the
taste
is
very
watery
maybe
there
is
some
malt
flavor
mixed
in
there
too
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
its
only
drinkable
because
it
is
so
light
an
awful
light
beer
cant
see
how
people
drink
these
going
to
have
to
say
avoid
at
all
costs
it
seems
every
time
i
go
to
a
party
this
beer
is
in
the
hands
of
most
of
the
party
goers
i
usually
bring
my
own
beer
to
parties
for
that
very
reason
i
still
end
up
having
one
though
and
each
time
it
reminds
me
how
much
i
dislike
this
beer
the
appearance
is
pretty
bad
just
a
bland
watery
pilsner
the
smell
isnt
better
still
awful
this
beer
has
almost
no
taste
to
me
the
only
taste
i
notice
is
something
like
half
beer
and
half
water
a
very
poor
beer
also
a
great
indicator
of
bad
taste
poured
into
a
clear
plastic
fest
mug
about
all
it
deserves
formed
a
2
bright
white
head
over
the
light
yellow
liquid
head
actually
lasts
reasonably
well
with
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
totally
mia
maybe
the
slightest
whiff
of
pale
andor
adjunct
sweetness
taste
is
the
same
sweetness
that
was
almost
found
in
the
nose
which
carries
throughout
mouthfeel
is
not
detrimental
just
totally
nondescript
so
hard
to
subtract
points
there
relatively
drinkable
if
youre
into
this
sort
of
thing
i
guess
ive
become
more
of
a
bmc
soft
touch
than
i
was
when
i
reviewed
it
in
the
can
oh
well
a
pox
on
this
beer
its
utter
drek
drinkability
gross
not
only
does
this
beer
lack
taste
and
body
even
for
a
light
beer
but
its
chock
full
of
impurities
and
preservatives
that
give
me
a
massive
headache
asprin
takes
away
headaches
bud
light
gives
them
i
can
taste
the
marketting
more
than
the
hops
if
there
are
any
at
15
for
a
30
pack
its
no
wonder
why
it
shows
up
at
every
poker
party
bbq
wedding
etc
my
brother
loves
it
he
also
puts
his
steaks
on
the
grill
straight
from
the
freezer
this
is
a
drinkers
beer
so
drink
up
johnny
mk
d
easy
to
drink
i
would
prefer
to
drink
other
things
but
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
only
thing
in
my
girlfriends
fridge
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
one
inch
head
that
dissapates
to
a
film
smell
has
sweet
malt
with
no
hops
taste
is
sweet
not
really
malty
and
no
hops
very
thin
in
the
mouth
can
drink
if
its
cold
enough
but
overall
not
a
favorite
drinks
okay
all
things
considered
i
consider
this
the
best
of
the
worst
as
far
as
macroswill
goes
still
does
the
job
after
cutting
the
lawn
d
like
i
said
above
i
drank
this
by
mistake
when
someone
handed
me
a
refill
since
it
was
bought
for
me
i
did
the
polite
thing
and
finish
it
i
wish
i
left
it
on
a
table
and
walked
away
later
in
the
day
i
had
awful
stomach
cramps
which
i
am
totally
blaming
on
this
pathetic
excuse
of
a
beer
it
is
true
that
i
began
to
drink
this
beer
with
low
expectations
but
this
beer
genuinely
fell
even
short
of
what
id
expected
ill
switch
to
md
2020
before
i
stock
this
stuff
in
my
house
expanding
upon
my
review
of
the
bottled
version
ontap
it
is
still
and
perhaps
more
if
that
is
possible
watered
down
than
the
bottle
version
there
is
less
carbonation
than
the
bottled
version
but
still
the
same
watered
down
beer
if
it
is
the
only
beer
available
than
go
for
it
but
typically
there
will
be
something
more
appealing
great
for
fraternity
parties
worldwide
it
was
left
in
my
fridge
so
why
not
put
a
couple
words
down
about
it
a
little
yellow
food
coliring
was
added
to
carbonated
water
there
you
have
the
body
maybe
my
cold
hasnt
gone
away
i
cant
smell
anything
taste
is
not
much
very
slight
grain
no
hops
yeast
possibly
mouthfeel
is
an
afterthought
a
farce
of
a
beer
very
watery
with
very
little
malt
or
hop
presence
a
very
dull
mouthfeel
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
unless
i
was
stuck
at
a
house
or
on
a
island
and
it
was
the
only
beer
there
bud
light
a
beer
of
choice
when
u
are
at
a
college
party
for
its
drinkablity
but
to
sit
around
and
enjoy
blah
very
light
in
color
the
smell
non
existant
bud
light
is
a
very
boring
beer
as
it
goes
down
your
throat
the
taste
reminds
me
of
water
thats
right
its
like
drinking
water
a
plus
one
this
beer
is
that
it
is
cheap
and
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
like
nothing
but
if
it
was
to
me
id
take
the
money
i
spent
one
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
and
buy
me
a
single
of
some
real
beer
taste
isnt
too
bad
since
its
lacking
a
bit
extra
but
i
mean
do
not
go
to
crazy
with
it
for
it
will
come
back
and
give
a
massive
hangover
if
you
underestarmate
the
taste
so
yeah
dat
drinkability
you
got
is
a
killer
for
this
one
i
told
the
guy
at
the
counter
that
he
had
a
damn
good
spot
to
sell
beer
if
he
ever
decided
to
this
was
after
he
refused
to
sell
me
a
cold
beer
so
if
im
looking
for
a
beer
with
light
body
low
abv
and
lots
of
corn
flavor
and
i
can
drink
gallons
without
feeling
full
or
drunk
it
turns
out
budwieser
is
damn
near
perfect
factor
in
that
its
price
is
condusive
to
feeding
the
five
thousand
and
you
have
a
winner
on
your
hands
dont
fight
it
besides
wrapping
your
gutgoobered
orangestained
fingers
around
a
tulip
glass
to
quaff
your
ipa
really
just
wouldnt
be
right
dnot
one
for
menot
enough
flavor
this
is
one
to
drink
if
you
are
looking
to
get
drunk
no
flavor
and
it
goes
down
like
water
i
thought
i
should
give
this
crud
a
try
just
to
see
what
all
the
commercial
hype
is
about
my
first
mistake
was
pouring
the
beer
into
a
glass
instead
of
just
chugging
from
the
can
it
made
a
lot
of
nice
frothy
head
and
im
giving
it
points
on
that
only
the
downside
is
that
all
the
carbonation
had
gone
after
that
since
theres
no
body
to
keep
it
in
leaving
me
not
just
with
bad
beer
but
flat
bad
beer
as
well
i
cant
even
say
it
had
a
taste
it
was
kind
of
like
sour
water
there
was
no
hop
flavor
malt
flavor
or
even
yeast
flavor
all
in
all
one
more
reason
to
be
wary
of
american
pop
culture
bad
news
cant
argue
with
free
beer
sometimes
though
overall
id
say
this
is
a
very
typical
representation
of
a
light
lager
unfortunately
d
of
course
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
its
like
drinking
tap
water
not
very
drinkable
it
doesnt
have
flavor
body
or
drinkability
i
pray
to
god
i
never
drink
this
again
on
that
note
bud
light
is
almost
beerflavored
water
bud
light
is
something
to
drink
when
youre
afraid
youre
putting
on
too
many
pounds
or
want
to
be
polite
and
accept
a
beer
from
a
friend
if
you
have
to
buy
bud
light
the
least
you
can
do
is
buy
it
in
bottles
i
think
drinking
this
stuff
from
the
can
will
just
make
it
that
much
more
apparent
how
worthless
this
stuff
is
that
being
said
it
doesnt
taste
bad
and
i
can
drink
it
if
my
friends
offer
it
to
me
i
just
dont
think
it
tastes
like
a
beer
im
a
lightweight
but
i
drank
an
awful
lot
of
these
and
never
felt
too
drunk
at
4
2
this
is
kind
of
a
waste
of
my
time
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
to
avoid
at
all
costs
im
looking
at
the
rest
of
the
pint
and
dreading
finishing
it
not
a
great
beer
but
alright
for
a
warm
sunday
pass
it
up
there
are
plenty
of
better
light
beers
on
the
market
if
you
have
to
go
there
so
much
for
my
take
on
the
matter
however
light
beer
drinkers
are
quite
simply
looking
for
different
things
from
their
beer
than
i
am
with
my
three
criteria
if
bud
light
delivers
on
their
requirements
good
show
for
them
say
i
i
used
to
use
beer
as
yet
another
means
to
look
down
on
others
but
thankfully
those
days
are
long
gone
light
beer
drinkers
could
care
less
about
the
opinions
of
beer
snobs
much
less
exbeer
snobs
and
theres
no
reason
for
that
to
change
sadly
ive
probably
drinken
more
of
this
than
any
other
beer
it
looks
like
piss
smells
like
piss
and
tastes
like
piss
but
after
23
cans
it
becomes
more
drinkable
even
after
8
cans
you
will
still
be
aware
that
it
tastes
like
crap
but
tat
that
point
you
just
dont
care
anymore
the
only
redeeming
factor
is
that
its
cheap
but
it
tastes
cheap
too
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
drink
these
kind
of
beers
this
is
what
gives
beer
a
bad
name
never
again
drinkability
this
is
as
drinkable
as
any
light
beer
goes
down
easy
if
you
just
want
a
thirstquencher
but
if
you
want
something
that
you
can
really
enjoy
look
elsewhere
this
tastes
like
nothing
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
nothing
to
get
in
the
way
of
pouring
it
straight
down
the
gullet
consumed
as
a
ba
would
consume
it
the
beer
gets
very
astringent
and
unpleasant
as
it
warms
so
drink
it
while
its
cold
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
theres
a
reason
why
its
the
most
popular
beer
on
earth
and
ill
take
it
before
a
lot
of
craft
beers
in
a
heartbeat
notes
id
pass
on
this
drinking
budweiser
is
one
thing
but
bud
light
why
well
it
was
the
only
beer
in
my
fridge
left
by
someone
poured
a
watery
crystal
clear
and
oh
so
pale
yellow
large
head
as
a
result
of
me
takening
out
my
aggression
caused
by
no
better
beer
by
pouring
as
fast
and
hard
as
possible
smell
is
lightest
of
malt
and
adjunct
taste
is
same
not
much
of
anything
to
describe
mouthfeel
like
water
with
a
shot
of
beer
in
it
it
is
very
drinkable
out
of
a
funnel
very
weak
beer
appearance
is
very
light
yellowgolden
smell
is
inconsequential
nothing
really
too
it
a
little
grainy
and
bitter
just
like
the
taste
its
smooth
going
down
cos
theres
nothing
to
it
so
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
wo
really
enjoying
it
and
taking
a
long
time
to
get
any
type
of
buzz
going
less
filling
than
bud
but
has
less
taste
and
thats
not
saying
much
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
mediumsized
foamy
white
quickly
diminishing
head
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
weak
grainy
malts
and
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
very
light
clean
and
lacking
in
character
as
i
expected
from
domestic
light
nothing
really
offensive
but
nothing
good
either
more
weak
grain
and
hardly
any
detectable
hops
it
has
a
thin
body
weird
semislick
texture
and
lively
carbonation
i
guess
it
actually
wasnt
that
horrible
surprisingly
its
a
small
step
up
from
coors
lights
not
like
that
means
much
of
anything
but
i
still
was
left
with
thinking
why
bother
after
i
was
finished
overall
this
was
worse
than
expected
it
is
drinkable
if
you
want
to
be
able
to
drink
a
couple
six
packs
in
a
night
not
sure
why
you
would
want
to
do
that
when
so
many
other
options
available
though
you
cant
drink
as
many
i
could
possibly
see
drinking
this
on
a
very
very
hot
day
when
this
beer
was
served
ice
cold
thats
about
all
poured
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
is
clean
but
like
most
macro
lagers
has
a
slight
smell
of
creamed
corn
just
really
bland
taste
is
much
of
the
same
no
pronounced
flavor
nothing
that
i
could
get
enjoyment
out
of
i
would
like
to
see
some
hops
come
through
just
a
little
at
least
mouthfeel
overly
carbonated
and
intended
to
serve
ice
cold
perhaps
to
hide
flavors
good
or
bad
within
drinkability
i
could
imagine
this
is
drinkable
for
many
but
i
could
maybe
have
one
in
a
sitting
and
then
not
have
anymore
again
ever
ordered
a
bud
light
on
tap
it
was
served
in
a
plastic
disposable
cup
well
proper
glassware
does
improve
the
beer
experience
and
what
could
be
more
appropriate
it
appeared
pale
macro
lager
yellow
with
a
minimal
head
it
went
down
smooth
like
a
nice
glass
of
carbonated
water
with
just
the
slightest
kiss
of
hops
to
remind
you
this
is
supposed
to
be
beer
this
is
beer
to
guzzle
it
is
either
lawnmower
beer
of
the
highest
order
or
it
is
the
lowest
common
denominator
that
serves
to
keep
beer
as
low
brow
as
possible
in
america
is
the
keg
half
full
or
is
it
half
empty
that
is
for
you
to
decide
drinkability
out
of
all
of
the
macro
lagers
perhaps
in
the
2nd
tier
of
beers
would
still
avoid
if
possiblethink
about
it
do
you
ever
add
water
to
your
favorite
cheap
beer
im
still
waiting
after
my
fifth
or
sixth
sip
i
finally
realized
that
there
is
no
taste
simply
amazing
body
is
nonexistant
this
is
the
second
worst
beer
ive
reviewed
to
date
drinkabilty
if
you
dont
mind
the
taste
lack
of
aroma
and
general
unbeeriness
you
might
could
have
finished
the
whole
40
i
couldnt
drinkability
id
imagine
after
about
5
or
6
of
these
things
they
get
pretty
drinkable
hope
i
never
get
to
that
point
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
does
not
lace
it
just
smells
of
nasty
corn
there
is
very
little
taste
that
is
dominated
by
corn
and
rice
the
mouthfeel
has
some
overpowering
artificial
carbonation
and
is
watery
overall
it
is
tough
to
drink
the
adjunct
flavors
just
take
over
making
me
heave
to
try
to
drink
it
quickly
however
it
is
light
enough
to
not
be
as
offensive
as
it
could
be
if
these
flavors
were
stronger
it
wasnt
till
later
that
they
admitted
that
is
was
bud
light
nice
try
guys
notes

this
is
the
first
in
a
series
of
reviews
as
i
clear
out
my
college
fridge
i
have
quite
a
little
macro
collection
from
party
left
overs
drinkability
very
drinkable
because
it
is
just
like
water
i
can
drink
it
and
ive
drank
large
amounts
of
it
when
in
the
company
of
friends
but
its
nothing
id
ever
go
to
because
i
enjoy
any
of
its
qualities
pours
a
lovely
urine
color
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
a
head
smells
like
stale
yeast
much
like
a
beer
glass
that
has
been
left
on
the
counter
over
night
that
and
corn
chips
tastes
like
carbonated
red
licorice
and
corn
delicious
mouth
feel
is
thin
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
must
say
this
is
a
few
steps
closer
to
drinkable
when
its
on
tap
indy
o
avoid
at
all
costs
a
yellow
straw
color
with
a
small
headit
did
have
alot
of
carbonation
this
smells
alittle
fruitybut
not
much
else
this
tastes
like
water
that
is
beer
flavored
its
light
and
waterybut
as
far
as
a
macro
light
goes
it
stands
up
to
the
other
swill
the
mf
is
light
and
watery
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
try
this
againbut
its
still
better
than
other
big
macro
lights
cheers2beers
the
only
reason
that
i
give
this
beer
a
3
5
on
drinkablity
is
because
the
price
is
right
you
can
hardly
argue
this
but
never
forget
you
get
what
you
pay
for
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
ab
this
was
the
first
beer
that
i
would
call
my
own
every
now
and
then
after
a
long
hard
day
of
work
i
still
like
to
sit
down
with
a
cold
tall
bud
light
but
dont
get
me
wrong
if
im
out
playing
wiffleball
or
at
fenway
and
my
buddy
comes
back
with
a
cup
of
bud
light
ill
drink
it
there
are
times
when
it
is
okay
there
are
just
way
too
few
when
it
is
right
a
little
good
about
its
sister
its
espectacular
aluminum
bottle
are
beatiful
really
can
help
to
keep
cold
the
beer
until
the
last
drop
its
bottle
is
one
of
the
most
advanced
innovations
in
the
beer
market
i
try
alone
withouth
food
its
pint
size
is
perfect
for
take
two
or
three
bottles
no
more
drink
direct
from
the
bottle
75
recommended
with
this
we
are
getting
into
the
awfull
beers
domains
this
is
a
little
hard
to
stand
and
maybe
with
sdome
other
beers
before
you
can
relax
and
just
drink
it
but
as
it
can
be
described
it
can
be
found
i
would
preffer
to
have
a
regular
beer
than
the
light
version
of
this
brewery
overall
i
would
never
buy
this
again
if
it
werent
for
having
group
gettogethers
where
my
buddies
drink
a
ton
of
this
crap
the
pour
is
something
of
a
goldtinged
clear
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
a
thin
lace
you
can
work
backwards
from
better
beer
or
forward
from
awful
beer
when
reviewing
this
one
there
isnt
much
of
a
nose
but
its
not
filled
with
corn
like
some
other
macros
its
not
overly
fizzy
but
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
watery
theres
not
a
lot
of
anything
here
as
far
as
the
taste
is
concerned
it
tastes
like
club
soda
with
possibly
the
least
amount
of
hops
and
malt
you
can
put
into
a
beverage
and
still
have
the
chutzpah
to
call
it
beer
theres
no
offensive
flavors
in
here
so
its
not
a
chore
to
drink
but
im
not
anxious
to
have
another
one
of
these
ever
again
i
got
this
ontap
for
only
90
a
12oz
at
a
local
bar
someone
got
this
for
me
and
its
a
good
thing
because
this
stuff
was
bad
it
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
an
inch
of
foam
that
dissipated
very
fast
no
smell
what
so
ever
and
if
there
was
anything
im
sure
as
hell
didnt
smell
it
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
both
bland
and
watery
its
sad
that
a
bottle
of
water
has
more
taste
than
this
beer
ontap
since
this
beer
is
cheap
affordable
low
in
alcohol
and
everywhere
you
drink
alot
of
this
stuff
but
i
cant
see
why
anybody
would
do
that
bottle
obtained
from
the
discount
bin
of
liquor
mart
boulder
and
consumed
about
a
week
later
born
on
15
aug05
d802
very
very
pale
dull
yellow
liquid
although
its
crystal
clear
pours
a
two
finger
fizzy
soda
pop
head
that
quickly
settles
to
nothing
smells
mildly
malty
like
honey
sweet
plus
a
darker
aroma
that
comes
across
as
sort
of
cardboard
and
mushroom
but
which
im
beginning
to
recognize
as
spalt
hops
tastes
very
watery
mildly
malt
sweet
and
with
a
dark
hop
character
hop
is
extremely
mild
and
is
way
below
the
sting
from
the
carbonation
in
fact
i
would
say
the
carbonation
contributes
more
to
the
flavor
than
anything
else
the
first
sip
was
decent
as
i
could
really
get
the
malt
and
hops
but
all
subsequent
tastes
were
lacking
im
not
sure
if
my
dfh
pint
glass
will
ever
recover
i
was
foolish
to
use
it
for
this
bud
light
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thin
like
water
the
beer
actually
improved
a
bit
when
i
swirled
to
release
some
of
the
carbonation
the
hop
flavor
became
more
prevalent
and
the
taste
of
iron
made
an
appearance
drinkability
low
when
im
in
beer
geek
mode
but
could
be
high
under
certain
circumstances
a
bit
better
than
miller
lite
and
lots
beter
than
coors
light
in
my
opinion
seems
very
similar
to
busch
light
actually
i
go
with
bud
light
when
i
dont
opt
for
diet
coke
or
water
and
have
to
choose
among
the
3
no
body
whatsoever
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
watered
down
drinks
a
lot
like
water
however
you
can
only
hope
to
have
it
taste
that
good
bottle
poured
a
very
light
yellow
color
lager
with
small
bubbly
head
with
not
much
retention
aroma
of
adjunct
and
little
else
taste
is
very
light
indeed
similar
to
water
with
bit
of
corn
in
there
body
is
so
thin
its
unbelievable
hard
to
believe
but
being
stuck
between
the
regular
bud
and
this
i
would
go
with
bud
moderate
carbonation
with
a
very
thin
body
i
guess
i
just
dont
get
it
this
is
the
1
selling
beer
in
the
u
s
it
has
no
smell
no
taste
no
nothing
none
neither
fizzy
watery
and
thin
and
those
are
the
good
points
as
they
say
it
is
what
it
is
im
surprised
that
this
is
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
bud
select
is
much
worse
perhaps
that
is
what
i
was
expecting
id
take
most
of
the
other
light
beers
over
this
but
its
drinkable
if
youre
thirsty
now
on
to
the
town
hall
smoked
porter
growler
review
12
oz
bottle
at
the
last
round
up
in
stillwell
in
you
can
imagine
the
beer
selection
they
might
have
in
stillwell
in
it
was
cold
and
wet
bud
light
finishes
pretty
dry
it
has
a
mostly
grainy
aroma
clear
and
bubbly
bud
light
has
its
place
im
glad
to
say
that
most
of
us
think
its
in
somebody
elses
fridge
note
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
listed
as
a
4
2
ive
always
been
under
the
impression
it
was
3
2
couldnt
find
anything
on
the
can
to
verify
this
though
drinkability
sure
you
can
pound
these
down
sure
it
is
easy
to
keg
stand
but
when
it
comes
down
to
it
at
a
party
i
would
always
consider
turning
it
down
this
beer
is
bad
it
tastes
like
they
watered
down
budweiser
it
seriously
is
watered
down
beer
very
popular
beer
i
dont
know
why
though
because
it
has
less
alcohol
than
budweiser
virtually
no
smell
and
no
color
very
drinkable
though
watery
taste
if
you
want
a
cheap
crappy
light
beer
coors
is
better
than
this
stuff
much
better
than
a
busch
though
i
wouldnt
buy
it
but
ill
definetly
drink
it
if
it
is
free
and
people
are
around
by
myself
i
dumped
the
last
14
bottle
of
this
stuff
out
takes
too
many
of
these
to
get
drunk
anyway
virtually
know
head
and
barely
smell
able
i
will
say
one
thing
about
this
brew
i
can
drink
these
all
day
long
without
feeling
it
too
bad
the
next
morning
and
unlike
alot
of
people
i
dont
find
this
beer
particularly
offensive
just
boring
maybe
its
because
ive
drank
so
many
of
these
that
im
used
to
the
taste
regardless
ive
had
worse
beers
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
this
beer
is
a
4
2abv
i
give
this
beer
slightly
above
1s
just
because
in
my
book
to
get
a
1
that
beer
needs
to
taste
like
puketurdactuall
piss
or
in
the
ball
park
and
lets
be
honest
its
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
offensive
i
can
drink
this
crap
all
day
and
hardly
get
a
buzz
glad
i
dont
deal
with
this
anymore
unless
forced
by
circumstance
i
cant
understand
how
this
sells
well
it
is
unfortunate
that
many
people
have
been
conditioned
to
think
that
this
is
the
king
of
beers
people
simply
dont
know
what
they
are
missing
drinking
this
alcohol
water
any
calories
you
save
by
drinking
this
are
marginal
and
you
lose
the
ability
to
enjoy
any
taste
mouthfeeldrinkability
fizzy
water
just
bad
we
need
to
wake
the
world
up
to
better
beer
because
life
is
too
short
to
drink
this
crap
a
clear
very
pale
yellow
dense
3
finger
head
that
retains
very
well
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
are
predictably
very
water
with
a
faint
adjunct
presence
low
alcohol
low
carbonation
and
lack
of
taste
make
a
very
drinkable
but
boring
beer
refreshing
and
light
but
so
is
water
dries
out
the
mouth
more
than
in
the
bottle
and
also
had
almost
no
carbonation
if
i
ever
had
to
have
this
again
i
would
rather
not
drink
anything
at
all
or
bring
a
glass
with
me
to
the
restroom
not
good
at
all
body
is
razor
thin
watery
and
soda
like
i
think
it
would
be
better
with
some
sugar
and
lemon
juice
in
it
beerinade
not
a
good
job
even
for
a
large
american
macrobrew
this
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
no
head
and
has
a
metallic
grain
like
scent
the
taste
is
slightly
malty
somewhat
metallic
and
almost
stale
very
little
appealing
flavor
needs
more
kick
and
a
higher
abv
drinkaility
if
i
want
to
drink
water
ill
drink
water
but
ill
stick
to
the
real
deal
beer
water
bodied
a
lot
of
people
drink
this
and
they
drink
it
fast
and
cold
there
is
a
reason
for
that
looks
like
pee
maybe
a
little
frothier
smell
of
who
am
i
kidding
none
of
that
matters
with
this
beer
this
is
absolutely
the
blandest
wateriest
beer
in
the
world
it
hardly
tastes
like
anything
why
do
i
give
drinkability
a
5
because
its
actually
so
watery
that
you
could
probably
drink
a
hundred
of
them
without
any
kind
of
cloying
aftertaste
or
taste
at
all
for
that
matter
if
youre
drinking
bud
light
youre
probably
at
a
crowded
party
or
lame
bar
with
little
or
nothing
else
to
choose
from
and
its
easy
enough
to
live
with
i
suppose
like
stale
ice
water
flat
club
soda
too
cold
nothing
room
temperature
water
is
preferred
slightly
yellow
no
head
a
bit
malts
dry
metallic
can
get
one
to
swear
off
beer
this
is
one
of
americas
most
popular
selling
beers
what
an
embarrasment
it
was
served
in
a
frosty
cold
mug
i
dont
think
that
the
condensation
hurt
this
beer
i
will
order
this
beer
again
on
occasion
when
belgians
are
not
availble
which
is
quite
often
as
alabama
has
the
silly
6
max
abv
law
just
a
terrible
beer
nothing
to
note
nothing
at
all
blasphemy
is
all
i
have
to
say
drinkabability
my
stomach
was
threatening
a
rebellion
so
i
left
this
nasty
beer
on
the
table
bud
light
sucks
it
tastes
like
water
with
a
touch
of
old
man
ass
seasoning
i
have
friends
that
drink
this
beer
as
if
it
was
made
of
gold
i
do
not
get
it
the
flavor
is
terrible
the
smell
is
the
best
part
about
it
and
that
isnt
very
good
either
as
it
tends
to
smell
like
a
dirty
glass
i
put
ontap
however
in
my
time
obviously
ive
had
this
beer
every
way
it
can
be
served
i
think
the
best
this
beer
gets
is
in
a
beer
funnel
that
way
you
cant
taste
it
and
its
gone
before
you
realized
it
was
a
bud
light
2
thumbs
down
on
this
one
i
guess
this
is
beer
i
cant
really
tell
not
much
color
basically
a
light
yellow
high
carbonation
and
a
weak
head
when
poured
does
not
speak
well
for
this
brew
flavor
of
watery
corn
and
watery
hops
with
a
hint
of
watery
malt
very
watery
if
you
get
my
drift
finished
weak
with
literally
no
aftertaste
except
that
of
you
guessed
it
water
nothing
good
here
go
with
a
miller
light
if
you
must
this
is
a
simple
review
this
beer
pours
pour
yellow
smells
like
nothing
and
tastes
like
nothing
a
sad
beer
and
only
reaffirms
that
the
big
3
only
care
about
making
money
and
nothing
else
when
this
beer
hit
the
palate
if
tasted
like
corn
and
something
like
hops
this
is
a
good
beer
to
get
drunk
on
but
that
is
its
only
benefit
poured
a
pale
yellow
crystal
clear
color
with
moderate
white
puffy
head
little
if
any
smell
taste
is
very
mild
mouthfeel
is
mild
drinkable
due
to
its
mildness
good
spacer
beer
between
a
nice
imperial
stout
and
a
very
hoppy
pale
ale
bud
light
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
if
you
like
average
everyday
domestic
beers
if
your
looking
for
something
tasty
and
special
youd
be
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
with
this
one
but
if
your
looking
for
to
slam
back
a
bunch
of
beers
on
a
hot
summer
day
bud
light
is
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
it
does
the
trick
just
in
a
boring
watery
kind
of
way
im
trying
to
do
a
better
job
of
reviewing
these
beers
according
to
bjcp
judging
standards
under
those
standards
bud
light
clearly
hits
near
average
on
every
category
genuinely
inoffensive
just
like
a
light
lager
apparently
should
be
outside
of
mere
judging
standards
however
theres
nothing
in
particular
to
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
it
is
ok
if
you
want
to
drink
a
bottle
or
two
without
getting
loaded
fast
otherwise
if
i
want
to
drink
beer
i
will
buy
a
real
beer
had
this
beer
today
when
my
stuff
ran
out
at
the
family
easter
dinner
the
brew
poured
to
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
fair
sized
bright
white
head
that
actually
had
some
retention
but
left
absolutely
no
lacing
the
aromas
of
this
brew
are
minimal
at
best
some
malt
and
grain
like
characteristics
but
that
would
be
all
the
taste
goes
right
along
with
the
aroma
not
much
there
i
cannot
pick
up
any
hint
of
hops
and
it
has
a
somewhat
sweet
flavor
to
be
truthful
it
has
the
feel
of
soda
water
over
all
imo
this
is
a
real
bad
beer
but
they
do
sell
a
lot
of
it
i
stopped
after
one
and
never
bothered
trying
to
pair
one
with
my
chili
there
seemed
to
be
no
point
well
its
drinkable
but
pretty
bland
sort
of
like
boiled
lettuce
thats
been
strained
and
then
watered
down
next
drinkability
none
even
if
this
is
free
i
will
never
drink
it
again
as
there
are
no
redeeming
qualities
to
this
beverage
i
know
its
not
popular
to
even
review
massproduced
but
this
beer
is
different
its
consistent
sure
youll
say
consistetnly
bad
but
no
this
beer
has
never
let
me
down
drinkable
during
the
summer
a
good
way
to
wash
a
hoppy
beer
down
goes
well
with
the
types
of
food
i
like
youll
say
there
is
no
craft
in
brewing
this
beer
well
your
right
its
a
mindless
beer
in
a
time
when
there
is
too
much
to
think
about
enjoy
it
its
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
fizzy
head
at
first
then
nothing
after
that
smells
like
old
cooked
rice
and
way
to
much
of
fake
carbonation
the
body
is
very
thin
no
hop
flavor
just
a
little
bit
of
grain
and
rice
there
is
nothing
to
it
but
a
cheap
buzz
12
ounce
can
sampled
comes
with
born
on
dating
on
the
bottom
of
the
can
pours
dull
yellow
and
clear
medium
bubble
white
head
the
question
i
have
is
how
can
so
many
people
drink
so
much
of
this
swill
this
is
very
lame
brew
maybe
id
drink
it
again
but
only
only
on
a
very
hot
day
a
1
rating
awful
really
translates
here
as
less
than
needed
to
be
observable
or
not
present
which
pretty
much
describes
smell
and
mouthfeel
taste
is
just
less
than
not
impressed
i
was
a
30
can
silver
bullet
boater
until
i
started
homebrewing
and
expanding
my
style
range
around
november
last
year
i
still
have
15
or
20
of
my
last
30
pack
that
i
use
to
rinse
out
my
glass
ware
and
give
to
my
neighbor
who
supplies
my
untreated
deep
well
water
for
my
homebrews
aroma
is
corn
and
rice
some
light
hints
of
malt
flavor
is
metalic
finish
is
canned
corn
not
good
but
its
better
than
coors
light
heck
for
a
all
day
mardi
gras
in
st
louis
its
not
that
bad
not
much
taste
but
is
drinkable
for
the
duration
must
have
been
a
million
cans
of
this
stuff
drank
on
saturday
if
someone
gives
me
one
of
these
ill
certainly
drink
it
i
try
not
to
actually
buy
it
too
often
there
are
much
more
flavorable
ones
on
the
market
i
had
a
bud
light
and
some
time
so
i
figured
why
not
review
it
12
oz
born
on
12005
cant
say
they
arent
fresh
anyway
pours
into
the
pint
glass
with
a
half
inch
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
on
top
of
what
looks
like
carbonated
water
with
1
drop
of
yellow
food
coloring
added
not
much
in
the
nose
and
what
is
there
is
a
metallicadjunctass
smell
almost
no
flavor
same
description
as
scent
here
beer
is
thin
and
dry
and
seems
overly
carbonated
as
if
it
were
a
soda
easy
to
drink
6
or
8
free
ones
at
a
keg
party
but
keep
it
away
from
your
personal
stash
clear
pale
limpidstraw
color
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
just
a
slightly
sweet
grainy
scent
clean
sweetish
malt
flavor
very
light
though
no
off
flavors
i
admit
that
using
rice
as
a
large
adjunct
instead
of
corn
helps
boost
the
flavor
to
a
2
quick
reasonably
dry
finish
body
is
thin
carbonation
rather
gassy
not
something
i
would
drink
if
given
the
choice
saw
this
in
the
fridge
and
decided
to
drink
down
appearance
was
very
light
yellow
with
minimal
head
carbonation
very
evident
smell
was
like
corn
but
very
faint
taste
was
almost
nonexistent
but
there
was
a
light
corn
syrupy
feel
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
drinkability
is
ok
but
so
is
water
despite
how
bad
this
is
i
find
it
drinkable
due
to
its
watery
characteristic
and
low
abv
i
could
probably
drink
it
all
night
would
i
drink
something
else
instead
yes
but
would
i
drink
this
all
night
if
the
fridge
was
stocked
yep
a
typical
light
lager
that
is
an
insult
to
the
word
beer
this
is
more
closely
related
to
water
imo
just
a
waste
of
my
time
uh
its
bud
light
at
least
i
tried
it
on
tap
i
did
successfully
avoid
this
beer
for
a
very
long
time
but
i
guess
i
decided
to
try
it
no
head
lightly
piss
colored
some
carbonation
tastes
like
seltzer
that
you
cracked
open
4
years
after
the
expiration
date
mouthfeel
yeah
if
you
think
water
has
mouthfeel
its
the
lightest
of
light
beers
ive
had
im
not
sure
if
thats
a
compliment
or
not
there
wasnt
really
anything
special
about
this
beer
it
would
be
a
step
up
for
big
party
hosts
to
purchase
this
rather
than
some
of
the
other
stuff
they
buy
sampled
hah
at
my
friends
house
from
a
22
oz
bottle
piss
yellow
with
no
head
typical
smelled
fainlty
of
hops
and
malts
moreso
than
any
other
light
lager
ive
head
taste
respectably
balanced
with
strong
hops
shining
through
and
a
lingering
malt
back
the
only
problem
is
that
it
tastes
artificial
nothing
tastes
real
the
best
macro
light
beer
possibly
the
best
macro
in
general
ive
had
to
date
but
not
good
what
a
waste
of
anyones
money
or
time
to
drink
this
beer
any
light
beer
should
be
taken
off
of
the
market
i
am
glad
that
the
rest
of
the
world
doesnt
believe
in
these
light
beers
and
discrace
themselves
by
making
them
sparkling
water
with
a
drop
of
food
coloring
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
it
was
so
pale
and
pathetic
i
could
hardly
tell
it
was
beer
this
pale
yellow
ghost
had
a
fizzy
white
head
quickly
died
down
to
nothing
took
a
whiff
and
smelled
stronly
of
sulfur
with
a
hint
of
adjunct
grains
ive
had
farts
smell
better
than
this
brew
taste
was
almost
nonexistant
but
still
was
like
the
smell
there
was
sulfur
and
adjunt
grains
if
you
could
drink
a
fart
i
think
it
would
taste
alot
like
this
beer
this
beer
was
too
fizzy
and
overcarbonated
just
one
made
me
bloated
mouthfeel
was
thin
like
water
but
sharp
like
seltzer
water
are
there
hops
in
this
beer
perhaps
they
added
a
hop
cone
or
two
to
the
whole
kettle
but
i
couldnt
detect
any
hops
beer
is
not
very
drinkable
but
i
was
able
to
finish
one
it
just
wasnt
pleasant
bad
bud
light
isnt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
at
least
its
not
skunky
but
i
havent
purchased
this
beer
for
myself
in
quite
some
time
and
i
dont
plan
to
do
so
in
the
future
drink
one
only
if
youre
doing
so
for
free
comments
this
beer
is
clean
crisp
and
thirst
quenching
unfortunately
the
list
of
good
qualities
ends
there
the
taste
is
borderline
offensive
this
beer
is
all
about
being
easy
to
drink
while
providing
as
few
obstacles
to
your
senses
as
possible
before
and
during
a
recent
football
game
i
was
presented
with
one
beer
choice
bud
light
so
how
bad
could
it
be
well
its
not
so
much
distasteful
as
nontasteful
its
an
unbelievably
pale
watery
light
shade
of
yellow
the
head
is
minimal
at
best
no
aroma
no
taste
maybe
a
hint
of
grain
mouthfeel
of
carbonated
water
no
aftertaste
frankly
drinking
this
beer
is
not
much
of
an
experience
at
all
its
easy
to
drink
but
it
certainly
doesnt
leave
me
with
a
desire
for
another
not
much
to
say
that
already
hasnt
been
said
about
bud
light
pale
yellow
no
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
water
mixed
with
corn
juice
and
then
refrigerated
bud
light
is
just
another
sad
product
of
the
carb
craze
bud
lght
and
all
the
other
light
lagers
are
the
saddest
syle
of
a
beer
ever
made
had
this
at
a
graduation
party
from
the
can
i
guess
if
you
like
water
from
a
can
with
a
hint
of
flavor
to
it
this
would
do
aroma
hardly
any
flavor
corn
and
as
it
warmed
up
it
just
got
bad
i
do
have
to
say
it
was
better
than
busch
light
by
a
slight
margin
overallveteran
beer
drinkers
obviously
hate
this
as
it
isnt
much
of
a
real
beer
but
i
suppose
thats
the
reason
its
light
this
beer
is
a
fine
beginners
beer
and
middle
of
the
road
light
beer
and
is
good
for
a
beginning
drinker
other
than
that
it
has
no
redeeming
qualities
that
make
it
stand
out
i
feel
it
isnt
as
awful
as
some
make
it
out
to
be
but
if
this
is
all
you
have
in
your
life
your
definitely
not
a
real
beer
drinker
id
still
have
it
if
offered
though
hey
its
a
pretty
good
light
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
taste
or
flavor
the
taste
is
horrible
like
a
bad
corny
bad
veggtable
taste
that
only
gets
worse
at
it
warms
up
it
basically
has
a
mouthfeel
consiting
of
water
so
not
much
there
and
considering
the
taste
i
personally
cant
get
through
one
and
would
much
prefer
just
drinking
water
respect
beer
i
dont
see
what
the
problem
whit
good
ol
bud
light
is
there
are
much
worse
beers
in
the
world
than
this
one
i
have
been
known
to
at
times
put
down
a
whole
case
of
these
while
it
cannot
compare
with
an
import
not
much
american
beer
can
for
what
it
is
worth
bud
light
is
actually
pretty
good
beats
the
hell
out
of
its
cousin
busch
light
it
pours
a
transparent
whitish
yellow
color
with
a
thin
quickly
disappearring
head
almost
soda
like
the
aroma
is
faintly
yeasty
there
is
no
real
malt
aroma
and
absolutely
no
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
quick
watery
hint
of
wheat
malt
and
corn
sugar
there
is
almost
no
body
to
this
and
thankfully
almost
no
aftertaste
this
beer
is
made
for
sheer
drinkability
in
terms
of
volume
and
not
pleasure
this
seems
to
be
a
typical
example
of
an
american
macro
light
beer
appearance
is
pale
watery
yellow
and
smell
is
of
the
usual
macro
adjunct
aroma
taste
presents
a
tiny
bit
of
flavor
but
mainly
watered
down
mediocrity
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
an
average
ba
still
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
beer
for
hanging
around
with
friends
when
you
dont
need
anything
anywhere
near
special
the
colder
the
better
here
the
beer
after
spilling
from
the
12ounce
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
minimal
frothy
bright
white
head
that
evaporates
quickly
leaving
a
thin
bit
of
lace
to
coat
the
glass
nose
is
malt
sweet
and
fresh
with
the
start
lightly
malted
and
somewhat
sweet
top
is
thin
finish
has
a
stern
acidity
and
the
hops
light
to
the
palate
fry
aftertaste
a
drinkable
beer
and
one
i
used
to
find
enjoyable
before
i
became
addicted
to
over
the
top
beers
ahh
yet
another
sample
from
me
bud
man
do
they
really
think
the
factory
fresh
bud
stuff
is
gonna
change
my
mind
pours
the
colour
of
washed
out
corn
smells
like
chemicals
and
tastes
like
it
too
no
hops
no
malt
at
least
miller
high
life
has
character
compared
to
this
charlaten
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
as
its
not
to
spritzy
but
drinkability
please
the
only
reason
to
drink
this
is
when
its
the
only
beer
available
very
drinkable
as
water
is
very
drinkable
but
the
only
reason
i
went
for
it
was
because
it
was
free
i
wouldnt
pay
for
this
stuff
i
cant
believe
some
people
drink
this
bile
nightly
ill
stick
with
guinness
there
is
no
saving
grace
for
bud
light
though
nothing
every
aspect
of
this
beer
is
either
painful
or
nonexistant
a
great
friend
of
mine
left
a
few
of
these
in
my
fridge
i
decided
to
crack
them
open
and
see
what
there
is
to
see
the
beer
is
a
yellow
thin
headed
macro
with
a
corny
smell
this
beer
tastes
like
veggies
from
the
crisper
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
the
only
thing
that
contributes
to
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
fairly
high
considering
it
is
made
to
be
consumed
in
high
quantities
by
the
least
common
denominator
a
very
average
light
beer
theres
my
glowing
review
for
bud
light
tastes
and
feels
like
paste
goes
down
50
easier
i
hate
bud
light
i
hate
anheuserbusch
i
cant
stand
this
stuff
but
will
always
be
a
keg
party
staple
for
years
to
come
unfortunately
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
again
ever
this
stuff
is
no
good
im
sorry
its
just
a
bad
beer
drink
water
this
is
the
beer
of
choice
for
social
gatherings
well
not
any
gatherings
i
would
attend
now
moderatly
priced
and
you
get
what
you
pay
for
clear
yellow
color
reminds
me
of
tainted
water
easy
to
drink
must
be
ice
cold
or
it
tastes
discusting
smells
like
rice
some
mild
bittered
maltness
this
beer
has
been
around
for
years
and
is
still
very
popular
with
the
non
micro
and
macro
brew
crowds
a
nice
long
neck
bottle
in
a
cooler
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
especially
when
you
are
mowing
the
lawn
or
something
something
not
to
important
not
to
impressive
of
a
brew
but
still
if
you
need
to
drink
a
cold
one
and
they
are
around
rather
disapointing
rereading
this
review
i
am
glad
i
have
matured
in
taste
beer
for
people
who
hate
beer
sums
it
up
these
people
could
teach
the
people
at
zepherhills
something
about
waterd
down
its
as
drinkable
as
water
so
i
can
not
knock
it
for
that
but
it
does
not
have
any
taste
if
its
the
only
thing
available
i
will
drink
it
its
better
than
corona
but
that
does
not
say
much
but
i
would
not
buy
it
and
laugh
at
the
people
who
buy
this
and
think
it
is
good
beer
people
need
to
read
up
on
nutrition
and
realize
the
carb
thing
means
nothing
why
oh
why
isnt
there
a
ranking
lower
than
1huntermay

not
much
taste
at
all
i
will
pass
on
another

to

these
are
old
beat
up
skateboarders
and
they
dont
really
give
a
shit
about
my
beer
knowledge
that
being
said
dont
slam
a
beer
well
the
drinkability
is
high
because
you
could
drink
a
million
of
these
the
reggaes
pounding
yellow
very
faint
smell
mostly
adjuncts
so
weak
i
couldnt
tell
what
they
were
light
taste
it
isnt
water
then
the
seltzer
water
taste
set
in
with
the
slightly
dry
carbonation
making
up
the
rest
of
the
flavor
this
beer
is
just
wrong
dmannjan
25
jed
overall
a
beer
with
zero
peronality
but
is
extremely
drinkable
good
for
the
ball
game
or
a
long
night
out
geez
its
like
1
50
a
pint
so
why
not
settle
in
with
a
few
bud
lights
anyway
i
can
remember
in
highschool
and
college
drinking
this
in
mass
quantity
knowing
nothing
about
a
good
beer
there
is
no
smell
to
it
at
all
very
bland
taste
was
weak
at
best
and
the
after
taste
was
that
of
2
month
old
rotting
underware
mouthfeel
consistant
with
tap
water
but
very
easy
to
drink
if
that
happens
to
be
your
goal
at
first
the
taste
was
very
similar
to
budweiser
but
the
aftertaste
was
pretty
bad
typical
diet
beer
if
i
were
drinking
quantity
it
might
pass
but
its
even
a
few
notches
down
from
regular
budthe
selfproclaimed
king
of
beers
lemonade
color
body
frighteningly
white
head
decent
lacing
to
the
bottom
of
my
cup
astonishingly
little
aroma
but
what
aroma
there
is
is
of
corn
and
lemon
the
faintest
taste
of
pale
malt
and
corn
mouthfeel
is
of
pelligrino
which
is
good
for
pelligrino
but
not
for
beer
this
beer
was
gone
in
a
flash
not
because
it
was
so
tasty
but
because
there
was
nothing
to
saver
in
retrospect
i
guess
i
was
just
being
polite
in
the
future
ill
come
up
with
a
good
excuse
like
i
have
hepatitis
to
avoid
the
neardestruction
of
my
palate
bud
light
is
in
a
word
crap
pax
its
beers
like
this
that
sent
us
searching
for
web
sites
like
this
transparent
nice
enough
head
faint
taste
of
some
adjunct
and
then
seltzer
i
taste
tested
this
with
3
other
lights
and
it
came
out
last
yet
i
have
two
friends
who
proudly
proclaim
this
is
all
they
drink
and
yes
they
both
have
huge
nascar
posters
in
their
garage
clearly
not
brewed
with
the
likes
of
me
in
mind
but
hey
if
you
enjoy
draining
bottles
and
cans
of
nothingness
down
your
gullet
be
my
guest
another
lousy
light
beer
try
it
just
to
remind
yourself
what
bad
beer
tastes
like
backdated
tasting
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
on
28jun03
this
post
is
based
on
notes
from
that
review
or
at
least
that
what
it
tasted
like
why
the
hell
i
didnt
switch
to
the
crap
wine
instead
of
beer
ill
never
know
but
i
didnt
and
so
therein
lies
the
inspiration
for
this
review
picked
up
a
couple
cans
at
a
wedding
only
to
retry
this
for
this
was
a
preba
brew
for
me
some
many
years
back
ive
come
along
way
since
only
to
wonder
how
this
massproduced
light
straw
colored
little
beer
holds
such
a
large
market
share
it
pours
so
clear
you
can
see
through
it
as
its
pouring
the
head
is
white
and
fizzy
it
fades
very
fast
to
not
even
a
thin
film
the
body
is
weak
and
lace
is
wispy
if
at
all
hops
malt
dont
even
go
there
for
not
much
to
be
found
a
slight
bitter
dry
finish
with
some
alcohol
kick
if
you
drink
enough
of
them
that
must
be
the
mass
appeal
i
hate
his
beer
as
anything
bud
seems
to
give
me
a
headache
even
just
one
this
one
follows
suit
but
seeing
as
its
so
watered
down
it
gave
me
less
of
a
headache
so
bonus
points
i
guess
basically
this
looks
and
smells
like
the
toilet
water
i
just
pissed
in
not
that
id
know
but
i
cant
imagine
this
tastes
much
better
wither
just
plain
awful
like
water
mixed
with
chemicals
or
something
no
real
beer
flavouring
here
at
all
save
for
a
bit
of
graininess
perhaps
keep
this
one
away
from
me
had
this
after
golf
because
the
clubhouse
didnt
really
offer
anything
else
fairly
easy
to
drink
without
getting
drunk
just
very
little
flavor
ill
get
around
to
reviewing
coors
just
not
sure
i
want
to
ruin
my
memories
of
what
i
used
to
drink
but
this
was
definately
not
a
winner
for
me
glad
i
steered
clear
of
it
in
college
otherwise
i
might
still
be
stuck
on
it
drink
up
cristal
clear
headless
pale
golden
tone
with
not
very
much
to
it
slight
hoppy
smell
not
very
elaborate
or
strong
brutal
taste
terribly
weak
and
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
some
perception
of
hops
at
the
end
but
rather
like
dirty
water
than
beer
i
just
wish
there
werent
so
many
in
my
fridge
right
now
there
are
no
hops
no
malt
but
plenty
of
water
was
used
and
apparently
yeast
was
present
at
some
point
had
to
go
with
the
draft
special
here
because
i
was
low
on
cash
this
beer
was
served
close
to
freezing
temperatures
and
was
nearly
giving
me
brain
freezes
as
i
drank
of
course
this
beer
poured
out
a
very
clear
and
light
pale
yellow
color
the
head
was
thin
tons
of
carbonation
slight
whiffs
of
grains
and
rice
from
the
aroma
hard
to
tell
since
i
was
drinking
yellow
liquid
nitrogen
it
was
hot
outside
and
it
paired
very
well
with
the
hot
wings
i
was
eating
left
a
slight
oiliness
on
the
tongue
i
didnt
let
it
get
warm
i
dont
know
if
thats
a
good
thing
or
not
i
suppose
ill
rate
bud
light
just
because
its
so
commonplace
bud
light
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
it
is
very
boring
because
it
is
a
mass
produced
beverage
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
youre
out
somewhere
because
you
can
find
it
anywhere
if
youve
not
had
it
youre
out
of
the
loop
the
pour
is
pretty
boring
the
aroma
is
kinda
boring
and
the
flavor
is
pretty
plain
but
it
is
a
staple
in
modern
america
not
a
bad
drink
but
if
youre
looking
for
an
intersting
beer
this
one
isnt
for
you
i
did
try
this
beer
before
they
water
it
down
at
an
ab
tour
and
man
that
was
good
why
dont
they
sell
that
overall
this
is
a
clean
lager
that
gives
the
impression
that
its
about
half
beer
and
half
water
very
little
character
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
that
is
nearly
crystal
clear
yet
has
alot
of
bubbles
racing
towards
the
headless
top
of
this
beer
the
smell
is
extremely
mellow
with
hardly
any
character
at
all
the
first
impression
from
the
taste
is
alot
of
carb
bite
and
abruptly
changes
to
a
very
faint
lightly
sweetened
earthy
grain
and
not
much
else
going
on
it
is
very
light
bodied
and
finishes
some
way
or
another
just
too
faint
to
tell
goes
down
easy
in
the
hot
texas
sun
but
im
not
a
fan
of
ab
products
in
general
cheers
for
the
bjcp
style
american
light
lager
this
is
pretty
good
maybe
4
2
5
but
it
could
be
a
little
less
syrupy
bud
light
is
the
most
unoffensive
beer
in
the
world
the
appearance
is
a
pale
golden
fizzy
yellow
tone
with
a
highly
carbonated
fizzy
white
head
that
does
stay
around
for
a
little
suprisingly
not
much
lace
going
on
here
aroma
is
not
off
just
mild
sweetness
derived
from
corn
rice
and
malted
barley
my
theory
is
that
people
who
dont
like
beer
drink
this
beer
because
you
dont
have
to
think
about
it
theres
not
much
to
analyze
here
or
to
taste
for
that
matter
flavors
blend
smoothly
because
nothing
stands
out
enough
to
collide
so
this
is
for
the
masses
and
their
marketing
campaign
allows
them
to
reach
more
people
than
i
can
fathom
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
highly
carbonated
like
a
soda
water
flavored
beer
drinkability
on
a
couple
levels
does
this
challenge
my
senses
and
make
me
yearn
for
another
well
no
but
can
i
drink
alot
of
this
low
alcohol
light
beer
yes
probably
a
12
pack
but
is
it
worth
it
not
in
my
opinion
i
remember
thinking
that
this
stuff
was
crap
even
before
i
knew
what
good
beer
was
but
i
was
at
my
friends
house
a
few
nights
ago
and
all
he
drinks
is
bud
light
i
wanted
a
drink
so
i
decided
to
have
one
wow
was
that
one
bad
tasting
beer
i
could
only
drink
one
that
night
not
quite
as
watery
as
some
other
macro
lights
but
that
might
not
be
a
good
thing
the
only
taste
i
recognize
is
grass
im
swearing
this
stuff
off
for
good
drinkability
man
at
6
bucks
a
beer
i
gotta
find
regular
bud
for
a
first
round
to
quench
the
thirst
and
all
this
does
the
trick
but
after
one
its
really
time
to
shift
gear
into
some
higher
octane
brew
the
evenings
beer
search
continues
with
my
bud
ontap
review
up
next
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
white
bubbles
and
produced
a
has
a
rice
beer
aroma
the
head
quickly
disappeared
before
i
could
take
my
first
taste
its
body
is
a
transparent
urine
yellow
color
with
carbonation
rising
in
the
mug
very
little
taste
to
this
brew
of
mostly
fizz
what
little
taste
there
is
is
that
of
rice
and
water
this
draft
beer
came
to
me
looking
pretty
normal
a
light
yellow
in
color
with
no
head
or
lace
in
this
brew
the
aroma
was
week
slight
hint
of
malt
and
grains
but
that
was
it
a
slightly
malt
start
and
a
bitterdry
after
taste
watered
down
is
the
best
description
for
the
taste
nothing
impressive
better
off
drinking
water
i
think
most
people
drink
it
because
they
want
to
drink
but
keep
the
evening
as
low
cal
as
alcohol
can
be
i
would
think
this
is
the
lowpoint
of
my
beer
reviews
the
best
selling
beer
in
america
pours
pale
and
clear
with
only
a
wisp
of
a
head
forming
the
aroma
is
the
standard
ab
green
apple
smell
no
hops
to
speak
of
no
real
malt
aroma
either
the
taste
is
watery
smooth
and
no
dominant
characteristics
i
only
would
drink
this
if
given
to
me
while
visiting
somebodys
home
there
are
two
things
that
perplex
me
one
the
fact
that
some
people
will
hate
any
ab
product
de
facto
secondly
that
a
beer
advocate
would
drink
a
lite
beer
expecting
some
mona
lisa
type
masterpiece
in
a
glass
its
fucking
light
beer
if
you
want
a
beer
good
for
drinking
with
a
diverse
crowd
this
is
the
right
beer
if
you
want
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
in
mass
quanities
with
no
problem
this
is
the
right
beer
if
you
want
something
complex
and
interesting
then
find
something
that
was
meant
to
be
complex
and
interesting
bud
light
i
cant
believe
i
drank
this
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
loose
artificial
looking
head
the
head
fades
quickly
into
oblivion
smell
what
smell
maybe
a
hint
of
graininess
taste
metallic
water
not
all
that
much
here
mouthfeel
is
very
harsh
with
gargantuan
bubbles
rasping
at
my
tongue
and
throat
drinkability
poor
id
rather
drink
water
i
suffered
through
this
one
in
the
name
of
beer
advocacy
maybe
the
worst
light
macro
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
so
thin
as
to
be
almost
nonexistent
drinkability
is
about
the
same
as
a
club
soda
or
other
carbonated
water
truly
an
abysmal
product
compared
to
coors
miller
lightlite
this
is
pretty
bad
i
mean
its
decent
but
it
is
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
itll
do
if
you
have
nothing
else
around
but
certainly
not
a
top
pick
taste
good
after
about
the
5th
or
6th
time
around
usually
better
to
start
with
something
stronger
like
budweiser
then
the
more
you
drink
throughout
the
day
gradually
slow
down
with
a
bud
light
this
beer
poured
a
quick
dissolving
head
it
was
watery
it
was
yellow
in
color
there
was
definitely
carbonation
in
this
beer
there
was
not
much
taste
to
this
beer
at
all
i
was
totally
unimpressed
by
yet
another
american
beer
i
am
glad
i
have
this
rating
over
with
baaaaaadddd
strawtransparent
color
with
white
fizzy
head
bottle
opened
like
a
bottle
of
seltzer
with
the
sound
off
psssttttt
flavorless
at
first
but
leaves
an
after
taste
of
adjuncts
corn
and
veggies
carbonation
is
off
the
charts
its
light
and
tasteless
making
it
an
acceptable
substitute
for
water
or
even
milk
right
peta
i
cant
stand
budweiser
and
bud
light
is
more
of
the
same
garbage
with
even
less
redeeming
qualities
this
is
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
so
they
choose
something
that
lacks
any
and
all
flavor
characteristics
if
youre
watching
calories
drink
water
or
certainly
find
a
light
beer
with
some
kind
of
flavor
always
looks
better
than
it
tastes
this
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
head
dissipates
almost
immediately
and
leaves
no
lacing
tastes
the
standard
ab
bad
with
tinges
of
bad
adjuncts
and
the
bad
hops
that
ab
always
uses
pass
on
this
unless
you
want
to
have
bad
memories
we
use
this
to
baste
hams
i
ran
out
of
beers
and
some
chicks
gave
me
one
of
these
needless
to
say
i
took
it
but
as
far
as
beers
go
this
is
towards
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
if
you
were
going
to
drink
anything
for
this
company
bud
heavy
should
be
the
only
thing
you
consider
not
worth
buying
how
can
i
review
a
beer
so
horrible
its
macrogarbage
at
its
worst
i
dont
even
care
to
think
about
how
bad
this
is
one
taste
will
tell
you
damn
what
am
i
thinking
and
drinking
stick
to
water
as
with
all
ab
products
it
doesnt
matter
which
beer
it
is
dry
ice
original
or
light
they
are
all
lousy
and
of
poor
quality
and
that
born
on
date
doesnt
matter
if
you
drank
it
from
the
brewery
itself
i
guess
for
a
light
beer
its
not
bad
pours
with
almost
no
head
light
straw
color
taste
is
of
watered
down
grains
hops
are
played
out
if
at
all
present
in
taste
a
distinct
pungent
chemical
like
taste
pervades
i
found
myself
longing
for
a
regular
bud
which
indicates
just
how
bad
this
stuff
is
this
was
my
beer
of
choice
before
i
stumbled
across
good
beers
now
drinking
it
again
i
wonder
how
i
managed
to
be
happy
with
it
before
this
beer
is
really
bland
even
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
its
style
it
is
ok
if
there
is
not
much
choice
and
you
really
want
to
get
drunk
but
if
you
want
to
enjoy
a
beer
pass
this
one
by
i
asked
the
bartender
for
a
sample
of
this
ive
never
had
it
before
and
he
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
crazy
i
knew
i
didnt
want
a
whole
pint
i
just
wanted
to
see
how
bad
this
crap
really
was
it
is
bad
pale
pale
yellow
tastes
more
like
water
than
beer
im
not
sure
why
people
drink
this
yuck
before
i
found
good
beer
i
drank
bud
light
as
one
of
my
regulars
yes
i
give
it
credit
for
being
a
light
beer
and
do
take
that
into
consideration
in
my
review
but
the
facts
shine
through
this
beer
is
one
of
the
blandest
dullest
most
overmassproduced
flavorless
beerwater
beverages
on
earth
but
it
does
have
fewer
calories
yes
you
can
down
a
few
if
they
are
ice
cold
but
try
getting
a
good
buzz
forget
it
anyway
there
is
worse
coors
light
so
this
beer
doesnt
bring
up
the
rear
taste
bad
beer
mixed
wwater
if
this
is
all
weve
got
ill
ask
for
water
instead
if
im
dieting
id
rather
drink
one
good
brew
and
2
glasses
of
water
than
sit
around
drinking
3
of
these
f
it
has
all
been
said
about
this
one
it
is
true
this
beer
has
no
taste
and
very
little
aroma
but
i
have
to
show
a
little
respect
this
was
the
first
brew
ive
ever
had
i
guess
you
could
say
it
got
me
interested
in
beer
i
will
still
drink
this
brew
if
it
is
the
only
thing
offered
especially
after
a
long
hard
day
but
only
if
it
is
the
only
thing
offered
first
of
all
the
color
is
disconcerting
it
looks
more
like
a
bodily
fluid
than
a
beer
then
you
get
to
the
taste
ugh
watery
but
with
a
slight
taste
of
leftovers
scraped
from
the
floor
when
they
brewed
regular
bud
tossed
in
combine
that
with
the
average
price
tag
for
a
24
pack
being
around
14
and
you
get
an
allaround
ripoff
its
considered
good
beer
by
those
who
have
never
had
anything
except
for
mgd
rolling
rock
or
coors
light
personally
id
rather
have
a
keystone
light
natty
light
or
even
a
pbr
those
three
beers
are
not
only
more
satisfying
they
are
half
the
price
of
this
overpriced
beerwater
hey
at
least
the
commercials
are
good
i
attend
college
in
williamsburg
va
right
next
to
busch
gardens
and
the
ab
brewery
i
have
to
smell
this
stuff
being
brewed
my
finacees
dad
drinks
this
stuff
all
the
time
hes
given
me
some
but
that
has
been
the
only
time
i
drink
it
and
that
was
only
when
i
was
hard
up
for
beer
what
can
i
say
about
it
its
light
in
color
with
a
little
head
due
to
carbonation
the
taste
is
nothing
great
its
just
there
i
guess
if
i
had
to
describe
it
i
would
say
that
it
was
like
stale
water
with
some
hoppiness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
remeniscent
of
water
not
much
on
the
drinkability
scale
but
its
better
than
the
bull
the
beer
from
a
tap
poured
to
give
a
light
golden
beer
with
very
little
carbonation
and
only
a
small
head
the
aroma
was
very
very
slight
malt
the
taste
is
very
light
but
not
tasteless
as
far
as
light
beers
it
serves
the
purpose
i
suppose
there
is
very
little
mouthfeel
since
it
is
so
thin
but
there
is
some
tiny
amount
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
drinkability
is
low
but
if
you
must
make
sure
it
is
ice
cold
oh
how
the
palate
has
changed
not
that
i
often
drank
this
but
it
regularly
showed
up
at
many
family
gatherings
as
it
did
this
night
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
lasted
longer
than
i
expected
doesnt
look
bad
but
the
nose
really
didnt
give
any
hints
as
to
the
taste
to
come
or
maybe
it
did
watered
down
bitter
and
overall
not
tasty
i
drank
it
but
the
first
sip
made
me
cringe
switched
to
soda
until
i
could
get
home
to
some
real
beer
a
good
bottled
water
would
serve
me
better
perfectly
clear
and
almost
colorless
with
a
large
snowwhite
head
and
moderate
carbonation
rather
faint
aroma
of
grain
and
a
mere
rumor
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
quite
watery
carbonation
stings
a
bit
sharply
tasting
yields
a
little
malt
which
fades
to
a
faint
bit
of
lemon
hops
with
a
crisp
and
dry
finish
little
more
in
character
than
a
sparkling
mineral
water
would
offer
it
is
amazing
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
for
me
over
the
past
five
years
in
terms
of
my
beer
selection
in
college
i
thought
bl
was
a
good
beer
i
had
so
much
to
learn
this
beer
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
water
with
corn
added
to
each
his
own
but
this
one
isnt
for
me
beer
makes
coors
light
taste
like
a
refreshing
drink
pours
a
very
clear
yellowishlight
straw
gold
with
a
white
head
that
drops
almost
immediately
to
just
a
collar
the
aroma
is
quite
limited
but
offers
some
dull
maltiness
if
you
seek
it
out
the
body
is
light
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
thats
gently
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
limited
as
well
but
offers
a
clean
combination
of
gentle
malt
and
mild
hop
it
finishes
exceptionally
clean
and
drying
theres
not
really
much
here
but
i
guess
thats
the
point
of
light
beer
what
makes
it
stand
out
in
its
category
however
is
that
theres
absolutely
no
offflavor
to
it
and
the
balance
is
dead
on
very
well
made
i
enjoyed
it
absolute
worst
of
the
american
macrolights
very
very
very
pale
very
pale
it
was
only
a
little
grainy
smelling
thats
it
not
really
any
malt
to
speak
of
and
as
for
hops
the
only
hops
this
beer
had
in
it
is
some
that
my
have
diffused
through
the
packaging
from
some
good
beer
it
was
sitting
next
to
on
the
shelf
very
carbonated
like
soda
water
with
yellow
food
coloring
the
only
reason
i
got
this
was
because
it
was
the
cheapest
6pack
in
the
store
this
was
also
the
reason
for
the
drinkability
not
being
aweful
i
was
having
a
feud
with
neighbor
and
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
these
to
empty
and
then
throw
on
his
yard
definite
white
trash
beer
people
who
like
this
are
into
stock
car
racing
and
hunting
i
personally
think
it
has
no
taste
i
once
tried
to
steam
mussels
in
it
but
that
didnt
even
produce
a
taste
will
go
with
out
before
i
drink
this
well
you
know
cheap
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
great
tasting
beer
light
body
no
head
plenty
of
corn
and
rice
though
for
cheap
shit
it
works
i
will
have
on
hand
for
my
friends
that
do
appricate
the
good
stuff
this
is
not
a
very
good
product
overall
it
has
a
very
bland
appearance
no
highlights
no
real
color
there
isnt
a
very
defined
scent
the
aroma
is
very
faint
because
it
is
barley
there
to
begin
with
i
can
not
drink
this
it
has
a
very
sandy
texture
and
goes
down
rougher
than
warm
ginger
ale
pale
liquid
not
so
much
strawcolored
as
it
is
just
gray
a
scary
deadlooking
color
freakishly
clownlike
aromas
of
cotton
candy
sweetheart
candy
formaldehyde
i
dont
think
i
can
drink
this
beer
i
push
on
wow
the
flavors
are
thankfully
very
watery
i
was
afraid
i
would
have
to
taste
what
i
smelled
there
is
a
very
faint
echo
of
the
aromas
on
the
palate
like
it
is
coming
to
me
across
a
vast
distance
i
feel
safe
if
i
was
a
gutter
alcoholic
i
might
consider
drinking
this
if
it
were
free
very
pale
yellow
with
not
much
of
a
head
clean
smell
and
very
fizzy
like
a
soda
not
much
flavor
here
at
all
if
you
like
water
this
is
for
you
but
water
is
cheaper
it
will
quench
your
thirst
and
thats
about
it
at
least
its
not
skunky
very
easy
too
drink
its
a
party
beer
whereas
budweiser
specifically
lists
that
it
is
brewed
with
rice
on
its
label
bud
light
says
select

521122had
one
the
other
night
because
that
was
all
that
was
available
id
forgotten
how
watery
a
beer
can
be
just
an
awful
beer
no
reason
to
drink
this
gives
me
the
shits
man
would
highly
recommend
on
a
special
occasion
this
beer
should
be
illegal
blind
taste
test
out
of
7
aals
this
was
easily
the
worst
metallic
watery
terrible
finish
o
only
reason
i
gave
it
a
2
was
because
it
is
so
cheap
and
widely
available
but
everything
else
is
poor
at
best
shouldnt
even
be
able
to
be
called
beer
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
put
in
my
mouth
id
rather
drink
piss
even
bud
and
coors
are
far
better
and
thats
saying
a
lot
taste
great
if
u
like
water
cons
you
will
need
to
drink
all
30
of
these
before
you
get
any
kind
of
a
buzz
at
all
hell
you
can
probably
drink
all
30
of
them
on
the
way
home
and
not
hit
the
legal
limit
then
i
question
whats
the
point
of
drinking
a
light
beer
at
all
when
one
imperial
stout
has
a
fraction
of
the
calories
as
30
of
these
not
a
good
beer
but
its
easy
to
drink
and
cheap
and
i
find
myself
buying
it
often
why
are
you
reading
busch
light
reviews
reminds
me
of
high
school
better
than
bud
light
and
cheaper
i
find
it
refreshing
and
enjoyable
looks
great
but
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
very
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
thick
head
thinning
to
a
lace
smells
like
fermented
corn
vomit
goes
down
pretty
smooth
with
surprisingly
hoppy
and
bitter
and
a
little
dry
not
bad
overall
one
of
the
better
light
beers
buy
this
at
the
gas
station
it
isnt
expensive
and
still
beats
bud
light
in
my
blind
taste
test
buddy
gave
me
both
of
them
ice
cold
this
is
really
refreshing
goes
down
like
water
i
see
all
the
ones
and
twos
on
here
and
i
kind
of
wonder
what
its
being
compared
to
the
price
is
right
and
when
you
go
fishing
or
are
at
a
barbeque
its
really
good
for
those
occasions
although
it
will
never
win
a
taste
contest
based
on
its
crispness
this
ones
a
staple
in
my
beer
diet
ah
the
ignorance
of
childhood
i
remember
my
friends
mom
used
to
buy
this
in
bulk
for
us
when
i
was
in
high
school
didnt
care
then
just
wanted
to
get
drunk
nowadays
you
would
not
get
me
drinking
this
no
matter
how
many
other
beers
ive
already
had
the
slightest
taste
of
watery
piss
swill
makes
me
nauseous
now
whether
its
natty
keystone
or
this
ab
abomination
doesnt
matter
save
your
money
for
half
decent
beer
leave
this
for
frat
houses
and
shitty
moms
to
buy
for
their
kids
and
their
friends
had
this
one
at
a
bbq
as
this
was
the
only
choice
available
busch
light
is
a
horrible
beer
that
has
no
flavor
whatsoever
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
and
it
has
barely
any
head
busch
is
one
of
those
beers
that
isnt
worth
trying
as
the
taste
is
very
watery
having
a
glass
of
water
afterwards
you
wouldnt
even
tell
the
difference
as
a
light
beer
its
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
stick
with
a
pbr
instead
good
college
party
beer
doesnt
have
a
stand
out
taste
ill
only
drink
this
from
a
keg
at
a
college
party
its
ok
cheap
but
better
than
natural
light
ha
classic
college
cheap
beer
buy
this
by
the
30pk
and
hope
it
lasts
the
night
good
for
drinking
games
overall
2
ive
had
worse
but
man
ive
sure
had
better
believe
it
or
not
in
comparison
the
abominable
keystone
light
is
actually
more
drinkable
probably
because
of
the
smoothness
i
find
most
folks
will
drink
this
brew
or
bud
light
because
keystone
or
hamms
or
natural
light
is
just
a
trailer
trash
beer

5why
review
this
because
it
was
ontap
and
i
said
to
myself
why
not
my
pint
glass
at
mckees
was
delivered
to
my
table
a
bleached
gold
color
with
a
trace
of
white
foam
the
head
had
already
fizzed
away
by
the
time
it
reached
me
and
there
was
no
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
was
very
weak
it
appeals
to
the
masses
because
it
is
non
offensive
but
given
the
choice
i
will
not
be
drinking
it
again

its

it

probably
the
only

was
that
this

extremely

be
an

quencher
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
worst
of

5its
an
inexpensive
beer
to
buy
and
i
think
it
has
a
little
more
taste
than
other
light
beers
i
have
tried
it
has
a
light
gold
color
not
very
much
head
if
poured
into
a
glass
i
find
it
leaves
no
bad
after
taste
and
is
very
drinkable
on
a
day
when
i
just
want
a
few
cold
beers

and
left

in

i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
shot
i
dont

why
i
bothered
its
a
mix
of
a
great
deal
of

a

the

the
only
reason
people
drink
this

because

they

they
are

taste
mostly
comes
from
the
carbonation
beneath
the
acrid
carb
sting
is
a
gentle
malt
sweet
and
a
hop
floral
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
bit
hop
bitter
and
the
hop
flavor
is
a
bit
more
flat
than
earlier
superthin
body
and
heavily
carbonated
wow
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
a
beer
where
the
carbonation
was
the
predominant
flavor
beer
scored
to
style
not
my
flavor
preferences
busch
light
isnt
good
beer
but
i
think
you
knew
that
already
it
is
however
ever
so
slightly
preferable
to
coors
light
when
it
comes
to
the
flavor
of
a
macro
light
less
is
often
more
busch
light
may
not
be
as
cold
tasting
what
a
bunch
of
hooey
but
it
should
be
as
close
as
possible
to
freezing
while
still
being
able
to
exit
the
canbottle
as
a
liquid
before
drinking
if
you
absolutely
must
that
is
ive
gotta
say
for
a
cheap
ass
beer
this
brew
could
be
a
helluva
lot
worse
pours
out
to
a
light
yellow
color
with
high
carbonation
but
a
short
lived
head
aroma
of
corn
is
most
noted
as
there
isnt
much
else
in
this
brew
flavors
of
watery
barley
and
corn
are
noted
but
again
nothing
else
finished
clean
and
crisp
nothing
great
here
but
i
can
see
this
beer
being
a
favorite
of
college
kids
with
no
desire
to
appreciate
beer
in
all
its
true
glory
if
youre
gonna
drink
crap
this
is
the
beer
for
you
i
have
many
busch
fueled
memories
from
college
and
to
be
honest
why
plunk
down
more
money
for
bud
etc
when
busch
is
cheaper
and
tastes
as
good
if
not
better
ive
found
that
from
the
bottle
it
has
a
nice
beery
characteristic
that
most
light
beers
lack
cooked
corn
grassiness
etc
are
still
present
but
thats
all
a
part
of
the
style
a
bit
overcarbonated
in
the
can
but
out
of
the
bottle
its
not
bad
dont
get
me
wrong
its
an
awful
horrid
beer
but
its
not
trying
to
be
a
stone
ipa
if
youre
in
the
need
for
cheap
and
cant
find
ballantine
this
is
it
the
drinkablity
is
harsh
because
of
the
beers
skunky
quality
this
beer
is
the
official
keg
beer
of
ecu
cheap
flavorless
good
for
when
my
fraternity
needs
to
throw
a
kegger
a
light
american
adjunct
lager
not
much
to
say
not
much
to
be
impressed
by
inoffensive
pours
a
light
light
straw
color
i
actually
got
some
lacing
from
this
head
retention
is
minimal
very
very
little
flavor
i
cant
pick
anything
out
good
or
bad
perhaps
a
slight
sweetnesscooked
corn
flavor
but
not
much
moutfeel
is
okay
a
little
thick
for
a
light
adjunct
lager
well
perhaps
over
carbonated
id
drink
it
if
it
was
this
or
going
thirsty
but
i
wouldnt
look
hard
for
it
at
13
99
for
a
30pack
this
beer
is
overpriced
people
pay
good
money
to
get
this
on
tap
near
me
too
spend
an
extra
dollar
for
each
case
you
buy
and
get
something
somewhat
better
mmmm
busch
light
the
taste
most
of
us
grew
up
on
this
obviously
is
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
honestly
its
not
bad
at
all
i
would
consider
it
a
midrange
domestic
brew
its
not
so
gross
that
you
cant
choke
it
down
and
its
not
so
good
that
its
going
to
cost
you
an
arm
and
a
leg
just
to
get
a
buzz
i
like
to
dip
into
nice
expensive
treat
beers
once
in
a
while
but
i
always
go
back
to
good
ole
busch
light
the
more
often
you
drink
it
the
better
it
seems
to
get
although
it
is
quite
watery
and
almost
tasteless
around
here
its
the
cheapest
way
to
knock
back
a
few
brews
without
gagging
yourself
with
terrible
beer
beer
number
2
for
the
day
after
a
mickeys
im
either
starting
early
or
finishing
late
im
still
not
sure
this
beer
is
so
watery
in
appearance
i
would
not
think
it
to
be
beer
if
i
didnt
know
no
smell
whatsoever
and
the
taste
is
very
very
watery
maybe
some
adjuctyness
in
there
but
its
really
just
like
barley
water
good
to
have
for
its
value
when
playing
drinking
games
i
see
tons
of
college
students
esp
girls
drinking
this
bc
its
cheap
and
lacks
any
flavor
terrible
beer
to
sit
down
and
drink
with
though
pours
with
almost
no
head
its
really
weird
to
drink
this
out
of
a
glass
and
the
way
it
looks
is
a
darned
good
reason
not
to
drink
it
that
way
i
swear
that
it
looks
like
urine
it
tastes
kind
of
skunky
and
metallic
to
be
honest
i
dont
expect
much
from
a
light
beer
and
this
certainly
isnt
the
worst
one
out
there
its
a
good
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
cheap
to
get
wasted
on
and
hey
it
aint
keystone
light
pours
pale
amber
with
some
head
smells
like
skunk
and
alcohol
nothing
else
tastes
like
seltzer
thats
been
sitting
for
a
freaking
long
ass
time
but
i
think
i
detected
the
slightest
hint
of
wheat
it
may
have
been
my
imagination
mouthfeel
is
most
certainly
like
seltzer
drinkable
if
youre
playing
beer
pong
sure
otherwise
i
think
i
wasted
the
minutes
of
my
life
drinking
this
graduation
party
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
the
shudder
can
aroma
weak
corn
wheat
and
not
much
of
anything
else
flavor
weak
corn
wheat
i
have
had
better
water
i
just
do
not
see
the
attraction
to
this
beer
it
was
a
waste
of
time
to
even
open
the
can
it
tastes
bad
smells
bad
goes
down
like
water
so
you
can
drink
a
lot
overall
not
a
fan
i
can
definitley
drink
it
when
it
comes
my
way
but
there
are
countless
beers
i
would
rather
have
for
the
cheap
college
kid
though
me
very
drinkable
and
appealing
the
beer
departs
the
can
a
faded
gold
color
with
a
portly
head
that
is
frothy
white
and
the
lace
left
behind
a
velum
like
sheet
nose
is
crisp
and
clean
malt
sweet
with
the
start
somewhat
sweet
and
the
top
thin
as
the
edge
of
space
finish
is
stinging
in
its
acidity
and
the
hops
light
dry
aftertaste
went
to
a
frat
party
at
francis
marion
and
well
there
they
love
this
stuff
the
main
draw
to
it
is
definately
the
price
but
when
i
look
for
a
beer
i
would
rather
throw
in
a
couple
extra
dollars
than
to
drink
this
however
it
gets
the
job
done
for
cheep
i
instead
threw
in
an
extra
3
for
budweiser
which
may
not
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
this
stuff
overall
a
cheap
mass
produced
bargain
batch
ill
be
saving
my
10
99
for
something
craftlike
12
oz
can
i
guess
this
one
can
was
good
for
a
flashback
but
im
sure
as
hell
glad
that
the
alstrom
brothers
saved
my
ass
and
sheparded
me
to
better
beer
im
forver
in
debt
to
beeradvocate
notes
this
is
beer
by
definition
not
by
example
period
i
gave
it
a
good
drinkability
score
because
thats
what
it
is
a
good
get
drunk
beer
color
of
light
beer
i
guess
clear
light
yellow
minimal
head
just
ugly
hissing
carbonation
that
releases
unpleasant
scent
of
stale
sourness
and
lawn
mulch
taste
is
the
same
as
smell
sour
grass
and
sweet
adjucts
i
think
the
beer
attempts
to
distract
you
from
the
taste
with
carbonation
but
it
doesnt
work
absolutely
awful
busch
light
is
like
any
other
ab
light
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
no
head
taste
is
of
strong
hops
with
water
flavor
no
huge
smell
hint
of
hops
metallic
if
smelling
out
of
can
no
mouthfeel
what
so
ever
you
can
however
drink
alot
of
these
i
did
drink
these
quite
alot
when
i
was
in
high
school
very
cheap
and
just
as
equal
with
bud
light
which
was
more
expensive
personally
if
i
had
to
choose
to
have
a
busch
product
i
would
get
a
regular
busch
you
get
more
bang
for
your
buck
and
atleast
it
tastes
somewhat
like
a
lager
sorta
busch
light
draft
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
mass
consumption
beer
its
not
a
saturday
afternoon
beer
unless
you
are
in
college
like
me
this
beer
is
cheap
but
its
very
good
busch
light
is
extremely
smooth
and
good
ice
cooled
in
a
snow
bank
this
beer
is
much
better
than
the
trendy
bud
light
that
is
much
more
expensive
wehn
i
think
of
adjuncts
i
now
think
of
busch
light
this
beer
is
terrible
with
a
faint
yellow
color
no
head
and
no
carbonation
and
a
skunky
smell
that
makes
you
wish
you
had
a
rogue
close
by
the
taste
was
of
corn
and
not
much
else
it
was
absolutly
horrid
and
i
hope
to
never
drink
this
again
a
very
light
straw
color
with
a
white
head
no
carbonation
smells
of
adjuncts
and
grain
not
very
strong
tastes
like
corn
and
faint
malt
with
almost
no
hops
finish
not
good
pouring
it
into
a
samuel
smith
tulip
almost
seems
like
a
travesty
very
cheap
and
not
satisfying
pours
a
very
light
very
clear
yellowtinged
liquid
actually
the
head
is
very
nice
puffy
and
bright
white
with
notable
stability
zero
aromamaybe
a
faint
hint
of
cooked
vegetables
but
you
have
to
nearly
inhale
the
liquid
to
get
even
that
minor
sensation
essentially
zero
taste
as
well
with
a
little
tingle
of
carbonation
im
not
exaggerating
to
say
that
i
think
ive
had
seltzer
water
with
more
character
now
there
isnt
anything
unpleasant
about
the
beerit
simply
has
a
complete
lack
of
any
attributes
at
all
nothing
disagreeable
because
theres
nothing
thereof
course
that
begs
the
question
can
it
then
be
called
beer
final
thoughts
just
like
i
remember
should
get
bonus
points
for
consistency
from
one
bottle
to
another
since
this
is
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
if
i
would
not
have
liked
it
i
may
not
be
drinking
beer
now
in
a
way
it
has
helped
me
to
get
to
ba
because
i
thought
there
has
to
be
something
better
out
there
its
almost
odorless
which
may
be
a
blessing
and
terribly
bland
there
were
two
cans
left
in
my
beer
fridge
from
my
parents
last
visit
so
i
figured
what
the
heck
right
wrong
the
second
one
went
right
into
the
trash
i
wouldnt
even
cook
with
it
i
dont
like
to
trash
a
beer
because
i
know
someone
somewhere
likes
it
but
i
just
cant
help
myself
here
yep
its
drinkable
just
like
water
so
next
time
failing
other
options
ill
have
the
water
allllllllright
this
is
something
you
give
to
an
enemy
to
drink
i
cant
emphasize
the
blandnesswateriness
of
this
stuff
my
girlfriends
dad
drinks
it
and
hes
a
truckernot
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
maybe
that
would
show
that
he
doesnt
really
get
into
tasteing
beers
and
what
not
reviews
appearance
what
appearance
looks
like
water
with
some
carbonated
foam
on
it
smell
smells
like
teen
spirit
or
skunky
water
which
ever
you
want
taste
taste
is
as
bad
as
the
smell
if
not
worse
because
you
are
subjecting
your
body
to
it
mouthfeel
ah
i
dont
feel
like
doing
the
last
two
just
dont
waste
your
money
thin
watery
texture
borderline
of
a
very
pale
yellow
skunky
aroma
cooked
veggies
if
anything
on
the
nose
initial
bland
boring
and
rather
skunky
pushing
hard
to
detect
any
sort
of
character
trying
to
detect
any
malt
body
is
tough
corn
veggie
and
adjuncts
to
be
noted
a
very
bad

by

busch
light
from
a
can
that
was
all
they
served
at
the
recent
rodeo
i
attended
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
this
beverage
cripes
it
is
shockingly
pale
i
mean
take
a
bud
and
pour
half
a
glass
of
water
in
it
and
you
are
still
to
dark
no
head
initial
aroma
was
like
melted
wax
yeah
i
know
that
does
not
make
any
sense
the
taste
is
absent
i
mean
there
is
sweetness
there
toward
the
end
but
this
is
not
a
beer
im
not
kidding
ive
had
water
that
has
more
taste
than
this
not
enough
of
anything
even
to
be
awful
i
can
still
complain
even
though
my
sister
gave
it
to
me
free
this
is
the
closest
thing
to
tasteless
beer
i
have
seen
a
little
sweet
a
little
grainy
tasting
carbonation
what
carbonation
flat

drank
3
of

in

no

i
dont

it

the

bringing

at

this
beer
never
quits
being
the
most
iconic
symbol
of
fraternal
bliss
ever
created
this
beer
isnt
meant
to
compete
with
any
of
the
top
stuff
here
its
just
a
cheap
light
beer
that
you
can
throw
in
a
cooler
and
have
on
a
hot
day
before
the
game
or
when
youre
grilling
and
for
that
its
perfect
i
always
have
a
few
in
my
fridge
when
im
looking
for
something
light
brings
back
memories
too
solid
cheap
beer
good
value
brings
back
amazing
memories
of
college
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
best
cheap
beer
out
there
best
bang
for
your
buck
poured
an
almost
clear
slightly
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
fizz
the
smell
was
very
faint
with
only
some
rice
scent
the
flavor
was
little
to
nothing
with
some
rice
soda
flavor
at
the
finish
not
too
crazy
about
what
is
basically
iced
beer
tea
im
going
to
try
to
give
this
an
objective
review
why
i
dont
know
maybe
its
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
given
the
connection
i
have
to
this
beer
through
my
college
experience
well
here
goes
picked
up
a
single
16
oz
can
at
the
corner
gas
station
pours
in
to
a
craft
beer
exchange
pint
glass
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
almost
instantaneously
the
exceptionally
pale
translucent
yellow
beer
affords
a
good
look
at
the
bubbles
streaming
to
the
surface
without
them
it
would
appear
completely
lifeless
and
stale
i
was
going
to
talk
about
the
aroma
but
there
is
none
i
accidentally
dipped
my
nose
in
to
the
beer
while
trying
to
get
close
enough
to
detect
anything
traces
of
pale
malts
and
a
vague
beer
smell
thats
about
it
the
taste
almost
nothing
there
either
it
is
so
mild
and
nondescript
that
i
would
hesitate
to
label
the
flavor
perhaps
a
faint
aftertaste
of
creamed
corn
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
average
carbonation
and
an
exceedingly
thin
body
it
makes
you
wonder
why
why
would
anyone
voluntarily
buy
this
why
even
bother
i
guess
the
answer
is
found
in
my
college
dorm
days
my
roommates
dad
worked
for
anheuserbusch
and
the
college
was
located
just
outside
of
st
louis
so
if
you
use
your
imagination
im
sure
you
can
envision
that
this
was
not
a
good
combination
for
a
freshman
living
out
of
state
i
managed
to
wallpaper
the
entire
ceiling
of
our
room
with
the
case
labels
but
as
cheap
as
each
30pack
was
it
exacted
a
much
higher
price
in
the
form
of
poor
judgment
embarrassment
and
legal
fees
for
my
drunken
escapades
the
moral
of
the
story
drink
this
beer
only
if
its
free
but
be
prepared
to
be
completely
uninspired
possibly
nauseated
and
maybe
even
arrested
dirt
dirt
dirt
dirt
dirty
beer
if
there
were
a
category
for
use
versatility
ipecac
projectiles
and
sheer
memories
from
the
days
of
yore
where
a
case
of
this
was
like
having
a
briefcase
full
of
nudie
mags
i
would
not
put
that
amorphous
glob
into
the
overall
but
what
can
i
do
beer
is
a
social
drink
and
this
brand
did
a
lot
of
the
breaking
in
of
life
and
my
place
in
it
during
my
formative
years
this
is
absolute
piss
water
if
i
had
to
compare
this
to
a
movie
it
would
be
the
room
so
terrible
you
must
have
it
i
wonder
if
this
is
even
beer
disgusting
i
started
drinking
craft
beers
about
6
years
ago
im
29
now
i
used
to
drink
bud
light
as
a
college
student
but
i
would
always
avoid
natural
light
i
cant
drink
anything
from
ab
these
days
we
actually
keep
this
in
stock
at
the
hospital
pharmacy
i
work
at
for
alcoholics
who
have
to
have
a
beer
each
day
during
their
stay
i
pretty
much
have
to
apologize
for
handing
this
swill
out
i
would
advise
against
this
beer
i
sit
down
with
an
ice
cold
can
and
only
the
purest
thoughts
of
alcoholic
absolution
run
through
my
mind
cracking
open
the
top
and
listening
to
the
hiss
of
the
carbonation
im
immediately
transported
to
a
land
of
verdant
rolling
hops
and
ice
cold
mountain
streams
indeed
this
is
a
beer
meant
for
kings
and
gods
that
much
is
apparent
from
the
outset
a
routine
pour
reveals
a
beer
steeped
in
ineffable
majesty
the
cascading
golden
lager
results
in
sumptuous
suds
with
a
head
that
literally
begs
for
a
deep
long
drag
from
the
dry
gulch
of
the
thirsty
everyman
beer
meant
for
men
and
not
much
else
needs
to
be
said
brewers
can
do
it
right
or
do
it
wrong
and
natural
light
hits
a
slam
dunk
every
time
i
love
this
beer
more
than
i
love
pizza
i
rated
it
as
i
felt
appropriate
acceptable
only
as
a
beer
pong
beer
so
long
as
you
have
something
decent
to
chase
it
with
but
everyone
already
knows
this
beer
is
just
awful
the
price
says
it
all
bad
bad
bad
i
couldnt
finish
its
cheap
only
quality
it
really
has
getting
light
lager
out
of
the
way
in
the
classiest
way
possible
awful
taste
awful
smell
cheap
beer
not
good
watery
and
a
slight
skunky
taste
super
light
watery
fitting
for
college
drinkers
or
anyone
on
a
tight
budget
better
out
of
the
can
than
in
the
glass
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
if
its
not
ice
cold
you
will
be
gagging
as
you
drink
it
overall
i
will
give
this
a
1

nice
terrible
light
low
end
brew
throw
few
thousand
pet
food
bags
a
night
stop
by
the
store
get
a
couple
25s
slam
em
wake
up
do
it
all
again
the
way
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
enjoyed
this
stuff
is
really
gross
smells
and
taste
like
cat
piss
reminds
me
of
high
school
and
not
in
a
good
way
great
beer
pong
beer
better
than
bud
light
used
to
drink
this
back
in
high
school
when
a
30
pack
was
10
havent
touch
it
in
years
big
nasty
corn
wet
newspaper
aroma
and
taste
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
head
starts
off
thick
looking
like
soft
drink
carbonation
thinning
to
very
thin
but
not
completely
disappearing
smells
like
what
youd
expect
watered
down
fermented
corn
not
much
taste
at
all
and
is
quite
dry
on
the
mouth
overall
1
46
i
can
already
feel
myself
getting
a
headache
from
this
and
im
only
a
half
of
a
can
in
can
i
rename
this
beer
to
liquid
metal
it
might
sell
better
that
way
and
at
least
theyre
being
honest
about
the
taste
the
belches
have
more
flavor
than
the
beer
itself
so
in
closing
this
beer
is
close
to
the
worst
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
if
you
truly
hate
yourself
youll
buy
and
drink
this
beer
it
really
truly
is
pure
garbage
i
may
honestly
use
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
for
target
practice
on
the
range
drank
this
the
other
day
just
a
run
of
the
mill
cheap
light
beer
thats
all
it
isnt
bad
nor
good
i
picked
up
some
because
money
was
low
holiday
season
i
was
used
to
craft
beer
not
this
just
about
as
close
to
water
as
you
can
get
no
taste
no
head
what
else
can
i
say
will
not
be
purchased
again
went
to
a
friends
house
to
watch
football
last
night
and
he
had
a
case
of
this
never
had
one
before
and
i
never
will
again
the
worst
swill
ive
ever
put
in
my
body
it
is
reminiscent
of
a
drink
that
you
drank
most
of
but
theres
a
few
sips
at
the
bottom
mixed
with
the
ice
water
and
you
try
to
drink
that
watery
crap
i
could
barely
finish
the
can
and
could
not
drink
another
until
i
had
4
16oz
of
pbr
it
was
that
bad
the
color
really
looks
like
faint
yellow
piss
what
head
the
swill
has
flattens
in
seconds
the
immediate
taste
is
watery
beer
and
the
lingering
flavors
are
of
aluminum
and
morning
breath
i
wouldnt
touch
this
ever
again
willingly
decent
value
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
tried
this
beer
is
completely
watery
with
a
slightly
metalic
flavor
on
the
finish
really
this
beer
is
so
watery
and
nasty
tasting
its
hard
not
to
be
impressed
with
abs
ability
to
fashion
such
a
bad
beer
even
by
ab
stanadards
this
stands
out
as
a
particularly
awful
effort
nasty
stuff
on
par
with
good
ol
keystone
light
as
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
drank
i
cant
believe
ive
drunk
this
natty
light
unforgettable
name
that
accompanies
many
great
memories
unfortunately
a
very
forgettable
beer
in
an
of
itself
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
even
qualifies
as
a
1
out
of
5
rating
this
is
the
college
piss
water
you
use
to
keep
yourself
hydrated
in
between
shots
overall
not
gonna
set
the
world
on
fire
but
it
is
defiantly
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
after
mowing
the
grass
my
dad
left
one
at
my
house
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
while
watching
the
ballgame
and
i
grew
up
drinking
this
so
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
review
defiantly
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
drink
but
sure
leaves
room
for
improvement
would
be
my
go
to
in
college
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
10
per
case
only
drink
if
looking
to
drink
a
lot
of
beer
at
one
party
i
purchased
it
in
the
cans
and
put
in
the
fridge
for
the
nephews
who
like
it
they
pick
things
up
and
put
them
dowen
since
its
low
calorie
and
theyre
on
the
younger
side
of
beer
appreciation
i
had
one
cold
from
the
fridge
and
found
it
quite
inoffensive
in
fact
so
devoid
of
anything
that
it
was
quite
refreshing
like
busch
or
water
and
i
can
see
how
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
and
why
its
popular
with
the
frats
no
smell
no
taste
except
a
quick
crisp
carbonation
that
quickly
dissipates
no
odd
aftertaste
im
talking
about
you
narragansett
just
an
easy
4
2
abv
beer
its
like
stretching
out
for
the
real
game
or
coming
in
the
the
home
stretch
after
no
offense
no
foul
lots
of
descriptive
reviews
here
making
up
offenses
but
really
it
is
almost
as
inoffensive
as
ultra
light
where
you
suspect
it
is
take
calories
out
of
your
body
like
some
kind
of
flavor
vacuum
in
fact
im
so
content
with
its
neutrality
im
upping
my
rating
to
a

beige

of

5
go
to
beer
when
your
on
a
budget
nasty
light
pure
unadulterated
filth
easily
among
the
worst
beers
ive
had
the
misfortune
to
encounter
that
is
all
nastier
than
shit
i
like
light
beer
and
this
is
the
worst
drink
man
has
ever
known
this
beet
taste
like
watered
down
piss
this
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
theres
just
no
reason
for
it
to
be
as
utterly
thin
tasteless
and
generally
bad
as
it
is
i
mean
they
could
care
a
little
bit
about
what
they
put
in
cans
it
seems
to
me
delta
fu
i
am
a
sea
creature
look
it
up
o
overall
not
very
good
but
not
skunky
as
least
not
the
worst
adjunct
or
light
beer
out
there
though
not
good
at
all
if
youve
got
nothing
else
to
drink
including
water
this
is
passable
it
felt
like
water
not
beer
not
alcohol
at
all
just
water
unfortunately
it
didnt
taste
like
water
it
tasted
like
a
weak
and
yet
oddly
pungent
mixture
of
things
that
shouldnt
be
fermenting
together
can
cause
epic
beer
poops
the
next
morni
overall
i
have
to
admit
this
wasnt
nearly
as
bad
as
id
expected
but
the
thing
is
theres
just
no
taste
or
aroma
to
this
thats
better
than
it
having
a
completely
weird
or
off
taste
like
some
other
cheap
beers
o
not
pouring
it
down
the
drain
it
can
get
there
when
im
done
with
it
its
decent
to
drink
when
youre
trying
to
pinch
pennies
look
my
friends
here
at
beer
adv
its
natural
light
used
to
steal
this
by
the
case
at
local
store
its
poundable
cheapif
you
paid
for
it
no
hoppy
why
the
hell
am
i
drinking
this
over
flowered
beer
feel
to
it
simple
to
the
point
libationa
favorite
among
my
homeless
friends
and
college
dropouts
more
to
the
point
i
like
our
nice
house
vehicles
toys
and
bills
paid
im
at
the
age
where
beer
snobbiness
is
no
longer
an
issuestill
prefer
extra
gold
though
on
a
side
note
this
is
labeled
as
a
pilsner
not
lager
anywho
my
fraternity
refused
to
buy
it
for
parties
its
that
bad
overall
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
can
imagine
its
what
i
would
force
prisoners
to
drink
to
rehabilitated
them
from
drunk
driving
after
being
forced
to
drink
this
most
people
would
never
want
to
touch
any
beer
ever
again
overall

this
beer
took
me
on
a
bit
of
a
roller
coaster
of
emotions
at
first
i
was
hesitant
based
on
the
appearance
but
then
i
was
impressed
by
the
smell
immediately
after
being
let
up
by
the
smell
and
appearance
i
was
put
down
by
the
taste
but
then
brought
right
back
around
by
the
feel
a
very
peculiar
experience
for
me
but
overall
this
was
a
very
decent
beer
especially
for
the
price
if
i
could
rate
this
beer
at
zero
i
would
stopped
by
the
quick
pick
gas
station
after
work
had
low
funds
so
i
grabbed
a
sixxer
of
16oz
cans
for
3
50
should
have
been
my
first
sign
i
noticed
it
has
no
taste
at
all
canned
water
with
alcohol
my
dog
wouldnt
even
drink
it
causes
gut
busting
diarhea
also
pours
a
lighter
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
good
2finger
fizzy
white
head
that
settles
down
to
just
a
thin
layering
on
top
and
the
sides
of
the
glass
actually
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
was
seen
the
aroma
is
of
grains
and
a
hint
of
sweet
corn
the
taste
is
right
up
from
the
with
corn
first
followed
by
the
grain
lots
of
carbonation
that
is
excepted
and
common
with
bud
products
actually
the
taste
wasnt
that
bad
and
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
great
tasting
inexpensive
beer
by
anheuserbusch
also
low
in
carbs
carbs
are
only
3
2
compared
to
bud
light
with
6
6
and
the
alcohol
content
is
the
same
for
both
at
4
2
good
choice
for
beer
drinkers
who
are
diabetic
cant
tell
the
difference
in
natural
light
miller
light
or
mich
ultra
you
get
what
you
pay
for
httpyoutu
bezpsovixjeg
o
i
paid
1
39
for
25oz
of
easy
drinking
low
taste
beer
that
i
could
slam
quickly
and
not
feel
full
and
sleepy
and
thats
what
i
got
if
you
refuse
to
drink
this
beer
out
of
sheer
snobbery
just
remember
that
it
has
its
place
i
drank
it
it
went
down
easy
i
feel
slightly
refreshed
and
not
at
all
full
well
done
natural
light
youre
not
terrible
nothing
offensive
about
natty
light
but
you
have
to
look
hard
find
any
taste
to
it
i
am
not
going
to
trash
natural
light
again
it
has
its
place
in
college
frat
house
and
people
hard
on
cash
i
will
stick
with
miller
light
and
bud
light
which
have
more
resemblance
of
a
beer
the
saving
is
not
worth
the
quality
you
are
giving
up
with
natty
light
for
some
of
you
out
who
buy
natty
light
as
long
as
youre
comfortable
being
spotted
as
a
natty
light
drinker
go
an
buy
you
some
of
this
natty
swill
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
refreshing
but
is
not
really
interesting
enough
to
want
to
have
another
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
drinking
on
the
beach
especially
out
of
the
24
oz
can
o
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
not
offensive
its
perfect
on
a
hot
day
or
when
feeling
thirsty
for
a
great
light
beer
piss
poor
appearance
aroma
like
tap
water
disagreeable
taste
for
beer
yep
this
is
a
poor
excuse
for
beer
i
pity
those
who
drink
this
swill
in
order
to
minimize
calories
there
are
so
many
other
fine
tasting
low
calorie
beers
out
there
i
just
cant
fathom
why
anyone
would
opt
for
this
loser
brew
when
there
are
plenty
of
tasty
alternatives
well
this
is
kind
of
hard
to
review
mainly
because
it
doesnt
really
have
any
taste
or
smell
this
is
what
i
was
always
afraid
was
in
the
keg
well
it
kind
of
looks
like
dirty
yellow
water
and
it
is
pretty
smooth
the
lack
of
taste
is
a
plus
for
this
beer
since
most
beers
of
this
type
are
terrible
well
done
natty
light
win
by
having
almost
no
taste
overall
for
the
price
natural
is
a
good
go
to
beer
for
social
events
but
for
pleasure
not
so
much
i
used
to
split
a
case
of
nat
light
with
a
friend
in
high
school
when
it
was
10
a
case
the
alcohol
content
and
flavor
is
even
less
in
oklahoma
than
in
most
states
it
was
my
go
to
beer
when
i
only
had
5
in
my
pocket
other
than
the
price
there
isnt
much
to
like
about
this
beer
an
affordable
beer
with
a
light
refreshing
taste
at
the
end
of
that
nice
gulp
it
is
frowned
upon
by
many
people
i
know
but
most
of
them
have
never
even
tried
it
go
figure
this
beer
to
me
is
refreshing
after
a
long
day
you
can
drink
many
and
not
get
too
wasted
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
go
drink
one
with
a
open
mind
overall
super
light
tastes
almost
like
a
glass
of
water
that
someone
accidentally
spilled
a
little
bit
of
their
beer
into
not
good
at
all
o
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
not
very
pleasant
it
sort
of
tastes
bad
like
a
very
skunked
beer
from
a
green
bottle
but
what
is
really
disappointing
is
this
came
from
a
can
so
it
wasnt
even
spoiled
by
light
overall
i
did
not
care
for
this
beer
very
much
it
had
a
very
skunky
smell
when
i
opened
the
can
and
the
taste
was
a
little
like
watered
down
it
might
have
been
because
it
was
a
light
instead
of
normal
but
i
still
did
not
care
for
it
the
overall
mouth
feel
was
not
very
great
either
which
is
why
i
only
gave
it
a
2
out
of
5
despite
the
fact
that
everybody
i
knew
in
college
drank
this
stuff
by
the
gallon
this
is
only
the
second
time
ive
had
a
natty
light
it
barely
even
looks
like
a
beerreminds
me
more
of
water
from
a
rusty
pipe
only
with
tons
of
carbonation
smells
of
sugar
and
vegetables
and
tastes
about
the
same
with
the
addition
of
a
faint
metallic
aftertaste
very
very
thin
body
why
not
i
have
not
reviewed
it
i
heard
great
things
from
this
one
from
the
stcwb
poured
this
22
ounce
can
into
a
pint
glass
this
light
lager
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
produced
an
ultra
thin
white
head
and
featured
piss
poor
retention
the
aroma
consisted
of
cereal
grain
and
cooked
veggies
light
in
body
a
foundation
of
thin
malted
grain
and
a
small
dose
of
hops
bottom
line
this
is
barely
beer
overall
1
75
im
thoroughly
convinced
that
there
are
good
aals
out
there
but
this
like
many
others
is
marked
more
by
its
absence
its
just
not
bringing
anything
really
to
the
table
and
you
know
what
it
is
what
it
is
but
its
a
boring
slightly
offensive
piece
of
shit
overall
well
it
is
considered
a
frat
brew
beer
for
a
reason
cheap
cheap
cheap
and
not
one
to
go
to
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
flavor
but
if
looking
to
party
with
and
colleged
aged
then
maybe
ill
leave
it
to
others
though
you
could
waterboard
me
with
this
stuff
and
id
probably
enjoy
it
more
than
drinking
it
overall
this
is
a
good
macro
beer
definitely
worth
trying
this
beer
is
horrible
if
you
are
familiar
with
natural
ice
just
as
bad
then
you
should
know
that
this
is
just
a
more
dull
and
watered
down
version
of
that
the
light
part
of
this
beer
just
made
the
ice
version
a
lot
worse
i
wouldnt
suggest
and
of
the
natural
beers
because
they
are
not
well
brewed
the
cans
are
very
boring
and
unattractive
as
well
if
you
drink
this
you
are
purely
intending
to
get
inebriated
as
a
college
student
i
see
this
a
lot
but
i
cannot
drink
it
its
very
easy
to
drink
however
but
its
basically
water
i
dont
think
ab
intended
it
to
be
a
good
brew
just
to
be
drank
in
mass
consumption
papery
grains
and
light
sweet
apple
dull
and
insipid
dry
papery
finish
though
pretty
clean
astringent
if
over
35
degrees
when
super
cold
its
not
terrible
definitely
have
had
worse
quenching
and
nonintellectual
it
does
have
carbonation
which
is
a
life
saver
for
this
beer
without
it
the
staleness
of
the
malt
flavor
would
linger
too
long
well
it
does
anyway
but
it
would
be
even
longer
o
cheap
and
crappy
light
lager
what
do
you
expect
almost
no
flavor
or
aroma
what
little
there
is
isnt
particulary
good
either
bleh
o
i
do
not
suggest
drinking
this
beer
it
can
not
be
healthy
overall
one
of
the
better
light
beers
easy
to
drink
and
very
crisp
absolutely
love
it
my
1st
choice
when
it
comes
to
buying
beer
its
cheap
and
for
someone
who
drinks
it
like
i
do
thats
a
good
thing
its
very
good
when
its
very
cold
but
i
could
really
care
less
not
many
people
bum
beer
off
of
me
because
most
folks
dont
drink
it
beware
you
are
certainly
not
going
to
impress
anyone
with
natty
overall
if
this
is
all
you
can
afford
dont
drink
tonight
the
only
redeeming
quality
i
could
really
mention
about
this
beer
is
that
i
could
drink
it
at
a
moderate
pace
probably
all
day
and
not
get
myself
into
trouble
if
its
100
degrees
out
and
its
under
ice
in
your
cooler
and
no
one
else
contributed
to
the
beer
fund
that
day
forcing
you
to
take
care
of
it
all
it
might
be
an
acceptable
choice
maybe
my
go
to
economy
travel
beer
plus
you
can
get
three
quarts
for
five
dollars
out
the
door
its
the
goto
beer
for
bubbly
watery
beery
refreshment
so
pale
of
a
straw
color
that
it
might
as
well
be
clear
mild
chill
haze
no
aroma
oh
wait
i
think
im
getting
something
smells
like
metal
and
corn
my
favorite
tastes
a
little
like
metal
and
corn
too
very
grainy
and
watery
it
isnt
so
much
offensive
as
it
is
basically
nonexistent
by
any
beer
related
metrics
very
nearly
no
smell
taste
color
and
the
mouth
feel
is
akin
to
tap
water
with
some
carbonation
overall
id
suggest
going
to
bed
thirsty
before
wasting
your
time
and
money
on
this
stuff
yuck
had
this
beer
a
long
time
ago
thankfully
although
i
figured
id
give
it
a
review
based
on
what
i
could
remember
i
actually
remember
preferring
bud
light
over
this
garbage
anyway
poured
from
a
can
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
medium
yellow
with
absolutely
no
head
and
no
lacing
whatsoever
probably
the
blandest
looking
beer
that
i
have
ever
seen
the
smell
corn
adjnuct
thats
it
literally
that
is
it
at
least
it
smelled
like
something
though
i
guess
the
taste
is
of
the
lightest
rice
i
have
ever
tasted
and
perhaps
some
rotten
asparagus
terrible
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bunch
of
fizziness
the
mouthfeel
actually
completely
lacks
flavors
of
any
sort
although
with
this
beer
it
isnt
a
bad
thing
ill
give
it
a
two
simply
for
getting
rid
of
those
flavors
overall
this
is
the
blandest
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
why
buy
this
pbr
is
just
as
cheap
and
actually
is
pretty
good
this
beer
should
be
discontinued
as
the
only
people
who
buy
it
are
fake
rednecks
the
beer
pours
light
orangey
yellow
with
a
light
thin
layer
of
foam
leave
some
lace
on
the
glass
as
the
foam
subsides
the
smell
is
of
wheats
and
grains
and
everything
you
could
expect
from
the
style
the
taste
is
light
flavorful
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
or
mowing
the
lawn
nothing
earth
shattering
but
does
not
deserve
all
the
hate
it
gets
o
not
a
beer
i
tend
to
seek
out
beer
from
a
neighborhood
bbq
its
only
redeeming
trait
is
the
price
and
it
does
go
down
easy
especiallywhen
cold
take
it
as
it
is
natty
kicks
some
ars
for
a
cheap
fix
yeah
light
beers
shouldnt
be
a
thing
pass
on
this
for
sure
light
it
is
horrible
too
yikes
just
putrid
i
try
these
things
once
in
awhile
to
see
what
i
am
missing
sometimes
obviously
not
much
the
sad
irony
is
you
probably
couldnt
even
drink
enough
of
this
to
get
drunk
o
not
bad
for
such
a
cheap
light
beer
but
certainly
not
something
i
would
look
for
i
have
yet
to
find
a
light
beer
i
would
willingly
stock
in
the
fridge
so
this
one
is
par
for
the
style
i
would
consider
this
over
many
other
more
expensive
light
beers
overall
ill
give
it
an
average
rating
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
the
price
and
the
fact
that
after
cutting
grass
or
doing
some
other
summer
activity
you
can
slam
3
or
4
of
these
it
is
cold
wet
and
will
and
quench
a
thirst
without
filling
you
up
as
is
typical
with
a
light
beer
overall
it
is
what
it
is
for
a
broke
frat
boy
looking
to
get
loaded
on
a
wednesday
night
this
beer
is
perfect
even
for
tailgating
barbequing
boating
or
other
outdoor
summer
activities
this
hits
the
spot
because
yuo
can
drink
a
lot
and
it
isnt
too
heavy
natty
o
lets
face
it
if
youre
gonna
have
a
few
before
a
game
or
going
out
a
fullbodied
chocolate
blueberry
lager
is
going
to
be
too
much
while
this
isnt
an
amazing
beer
it
succeeds
at
its
own
goal
good
cheap
beer
being
a
blue
collar
worker
in
this
weak
economy
i
have
been
dealing
with
stress
and
having
to
budget
like
never
before
this
cheap
beer
takes
care
of
both
of
those
things
we
all
know
its
one
of
the
most
lower
end
american
beers
you
can
buy
but
i
have
drank
several
generic
brands
and
this
one
does
the
job
best
for
me
when
i
want
a
good
buzz
at
an
affordable
price
i
typically
prefer
the
6
pack
16oz
cans
but
sometimes
stock
up
on
the
30
pack
lol
the
smell
is
light
the
flavor
while
watery
is
still
good
and
makes
it
easy
to
drink
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
for
almost
3
years
now
and
it
makes
me
feel
good
after
ive
had
my
share
lol
it
doesnt
give
me
a
hang
over
or
head
ache
either
like
i
said
i
am
more
about
affordability
then
quality
right
now
and
dont
consider
my
self
a
beer
connoisseur
im
happy
with
my
natty
light
sitting
on
the
couch
with
my
girl
watching
netflix
call
me
cheap
i
dont
care
natty
light
rocks
now
should
i
throw
them
out
of
course
not
that
would
be
alcohol
abuse
so
it
pours
yellow
with
carbonation
angst
and
a
foamy
head
the
head
fades
fast
it
looks
like
it
supposed
to
aromas
of
barley
malt
cereal
light
yeast
and
clean
hop
note
better
than
anticipated
but
still
very
typical
the
body
is
thin
and
watery
the
taste
is
grainy
with
a
slightly
unexpected
dry
finish
still
nothing
extraordinary
all
in
all
a
typical
light
macro
lager
overall
just
as
bad
if
not
worse
than
the
bigname
bmc
lights
o
its
my
favorite
within
the
style
of
drinking
game
beer
i
would
rather
have
natty
light
than
bud
light
miller
light
coors
light
or
any
other
cheap
garbage
beer
this
affectionatelynamed
frat
water
is
a
musthave
for
all
collegiate
men
pursuing
higher
and
noble
ideals
o
i
dont
hate
it
but
its
pretty
typical
for
the
style
probably
wouldnt
ever
go
out
and
buy
it
unless
i
was
trying
to
get
hammered
actually
genny
ice
might
be
a
better
solution
there
onot
a
great
beer
even
for
aals
but
its
not
the
worst
i
would
drink
this
over
a
few
bmcs
though
it
is
cheap
beer
so
take
it
for
what
it
is
not
nearly
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
its
nearly
inoffensive
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
lightasair
beer
you
can
pound
quickly
and
thoughtlessly
youd
still
be
better
off
drinking
keystone
light
as
that
provides
the
same
cheap
buzz
with
maybe
half
the
gross
nodes
this
beer
is
absolutely
awful
and
doesnt
have
one
positive
quality
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
i
hadnt
had
one
since
college
but
i
was
drinking
out
of
my
fatherinlaws
fridge
its
basically
a
haven
any
and
all
macros
so
i
figured
id
run
through
as
many
different
ones
as
i
could
since
it
was
free
i
would
never
buy
this
now
overall
drinkability
nothing
particularly
offensive
but
almost
completely
characterless

average
as
this
beereven
for
a
lightis
way
too
watered
down
i
dont
understand
the
this
beer
does
its
job
comments
yeah
its
cheap
but
if
what
you
want
is
to
get
drunk
you
can
get
a
lot
more
hooch
on
the
dollar
with
cheap
whiskey
o
if
youre
looking
to
drink
something
and
drink
it
fast
go
for
natural
light
otherwise
you
can
get
much
better
options
for
relatively
the
same
price
1
0
anyway
it
looks
like
something
close
to
water
tastes
like
close
to
water
and
smells
mostly
like
the
can
is
came
in
drink
this
cause
youre
cheap
like
me
while
in
college
not
a
repulsive
taste
just
hardly
any
at
all
easy
to
drink
a
ton
of
natural
light
pours
like
your
typical
pale
lager
the
color
is
straw
gold
there
was
no
smell
to
speak
of
none
at
all
the
taste
was
bland
and
boring
honestly
this
beer
felt
like
water
in
my
mouth
oh
thats
right
it
is
water
with
food
coloring
added
my
grandmother
drinks
this
beer
like
its
going
out
of
style
she
always
has
a
30
pack
of
it
on
hand
take
away
while
some
believe
the
beer
is
tolerable
due
to
the
price
i
think
it
may
be
more
reasonable
to
shell
out
a
few
more
bucks
for
something
that
tastes
a
little
better
overall
perfect
to
clean
your
toilet
with
looking
back
on
my
18
year
old
self
i
realize
why
we
drank
this
but
now
i
want
to
smack
myself
in
the
head
if
you
want
to
go
cheap
get
some
high
life
its
dirt
cheap
which
is
an
insult
to
dirt
really
and
doesnt
exhibit
any
particular
nasty
offflavours
for
obvious
reasons
the
big
can
sure
is
stately
looking
and
just
as
inherently
slick
without
any
soul
and
i
just
noticed
the
mention
of
pilsner
in
the
labels
description
and
my
own
soul
died
a
bit
further
frankly
theres
no
reason
to
buy
crap
like
bud
lite
over
natty
light
and
people
who
insist
otherwise
stupid
college
kids
just
want
attention
pours
a
very
fizzy
head
and
it
disappears
fast
extremely
clear
beer
looks
like
water
with
some
food
coloring
smells
like
nothing
but
maybe
some
grain
tastes
like
nothing
but
maybe
some
grain
no
awful
aftertaste
thou
so
it
saves
itself
from
an
f
odsuper
light
easy
to
put
back
endless
amounts
of
these
i
actually
prefer
the
lack
of
taste
to
more
macro
taste
once
again
what
is
the
point
of
light
beer
overall
never
again
i
tried
this
beer
because
i
have
a
bunch
of
friends
who
had
it
laying
around
never
again
light
straw
colored
with
some
bubbles
not
really
a
smell
to
it
maybe
grain
grass
corn
taste
is
the
same
very
smooth
and
mild
tastes
of
grass
and
some
corn
mouthfeel
is
very
light
body
with
decent
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
its
a
cheap
beer
for
tailgates
parties
or
days
on
the
boat
not
a
very
good
beer
at
all
leaves
a
bad
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
and
gives
me
a
headache
in
the
mornings
people
get
it
because
it
is
the
cheapest
case
to
buy
in
most
distributors
at
least
around
me
not
really
any
taste
to
it
the
smell
is
sub
par
and
the
appearance
is
nothing
too
special
you
will
see
college
kids
drinking
it
and
thats
about
it
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
gets
the
job
done
the
job
being
inebriation
if
you
pour
it
quickly
youll
get
some
foam
that
dissolves
instantly
before
your
eyes
dont
even
bother
with
a
glass
just
drink
it
from
the
can
smells
and
tastes
are
pretty
much
nonexistent
it
is
what
it
is
cheap
and
ultralight
you
can
get
over
the
watered
down
taste
and
general
bad
beer
smell
as
long
as
youre
willing
to
buy
and
drink
a
lot
of
it
tastes
like
spoiled
water
mixed
with
aluminum
foil
but
that
dissipates
after
about
10
of
them
great
for
college
and
about
nothing
else
but
still
created
a
lot
of
memories
or
lack
thereof
mostly
good
for
frat
boys
not
something
id
buy
for
myself
had
this
in
an
old
chicago
as
a
humorous
way
to
mark
a
halfway
point
in
their
world
beer
tour
needless
to
say
this
one
can
will
be
the
only
one
i
ever
drink
while
i
can
enjoy
cheap
beer
for
what
it
is
there
is
almost
no
taste
at
all
to
this
beer
its
as
if
rancid
water
was
shown
a
picture
of
coorsbudmiller
light
and
told
to
try
and
imitate
it
and
it
failed
miserably
very
very
bad
beer
and
even
an
insult
to
cheap
beer
just
like
its
peers
bud
light
and
coors
light
there
is
no
smell
no
color
no
taste
just
do
everyone
a
favor
and
let
the
college
kids
have
this
one
even
though
i
myself
am
in
college
if
your
looking
for
an
alternative
to
miller
lite
and
want
something
with
less
taste
and
lots
of
smoothness
this
is
it
some
guy
reviewed
this
and
said
something
like
its
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
night
i
would
agree
stay
far
far
away
from
this
liquid
its
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
sure
its
cheap
and
i
guess
that
if
thats
your
main
goal
then
it
will
probably
get
you
where
you
want
to
go
id
rather
have
something
that
tastes
good
although
if
i
had
to
drink
some
bmc
product
this
one
is
so
bland
that
it
comes
off
as
completely
inoffensive
thats
a
positive
note
i
guess
bring
a
30
pack
to
bbq
and
keep
the
ipas
stashed
cheers
d
makes
most
other
macros
taste
like
dessert
avoid
unless
at
a
frat
party
and
in
need
of
losing
your
sobriety
m
incredibly
light
and
it
is
forgotten
before
it
is
swallowed
it
serves
a
purpose
and
i
have
outlived
this
purpose
and
this
beer
is
of
little
utility
to
me
but
about
this
beer
it
has
flavor
decent
balance
of
effervescence
and
body
and
quite
a
bit
of
real
beer
substance
considering
its
a
light
beer
im
new
to
light
beers
i
admit
but
i
think
ive
found
a
decent
brew
here
in
natural
light
d
well
you
could
easily
have
20
of
these
but
who
would
want
to
it
does
its
job
but
in
a
very
unpleasant
way
synonymous
with
bad
beer
for
a
good
reason
o
after
i
drank
natural
light
i
wept
all
jokes
aside
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
that
costs
less
than
a
dollar
there
are
many
better
options
in
my
opinion
similar
beers
such
as
bud
lightcoors
lightmiller
light
are
better
just
because
of
the
watertocorn
ratio
alone
can
like
theres
a
difference
the
appearance
is
its
best
attribute
and
it
was
unimpressive
the
rest
smells
tastes
and
feels
like
what
i
imagine
to
be
horse
piss
heres
a
tip
youre
that
hard
up
go
for
steel
reserve
or
better
yet
quit
drinking
overall
mostly
a
meh
beer
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
anything
at
all
but
the
smell
was
pretty
bad
id
avoid
this
if
you
want
to
actually
taste
and
smell
something
overall
dont
touch
it
unless
youre
a
penniless
pathetic
drunk
with
no
standards
for
your
beer
well
overall
its
not
disgusting
i
really
dont
want
it
again
though
just
judging
it
solely
as
a
light
beer
its
not
terrible
it
is
what
it
is
although
id
recommend
sticking
with
pbr
light
strohs
light
blatz
light
or
hell
even
miller
lite
if
thats
what
floats
your
boat
poured
from
12oz
can
had
to
try
as
was
handed
to
me
was
told
not
bad
for
the
price
price
does
not
matter
this
is
a
bad
beer
highly
carbonated
very
dull
in
flavor
light
straw
color
and
smell
of
american
aluminum
not
kidding
guess
it
must
be
considered
a
beer
but
really
is
not
good
spend
an
extra
buck
or
two
you
almost
surely
will
do
better
tasty
water
for
a
person
who
needs
to
drink
more
water
check
this
beer
out
its
alcoholic
water
but
damn
its
tasty
and
super
fizzy
its
a
very
weak
beer
and
serves
its
purpose
its
for
pounding
back
on
those
university
pub
pregame
nights
and
for
cutting
the
grass
out
back
12
cans
is
about
7
bucks
us
last
i
checked
a
deal
for
sure
and
theyre
great
for
sessions
i
must
add
its
not
super
boozy
but
alcoholic
enough
to
give
you
what
you
want
in
a
session
cheers
to
natural
light
i
dont
think
anyone
honest
will
repesent
this
as
a
great
tasting
beer
its
brewed
and
priced
to
get
beer
into
the
hands
of
people
who
want
to
be
refreshed
and
feel
good
but
conserve
funds
for
things
they
prioritize
more
highly
i
like
natty
light
its
not
a
great
beer
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
which
is
momentary
refreshment
so
i
cant
complain
i
believe
many
folk
dont
like
this
brew
even
before
they
taste
it
if
this
beer
cost
more
than
bud
light
it
would
be
the
more
popular
beer
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
first
light
beer
which
is
brewed
by
ab
how
much
time
and
do
you
think
ab
put
into
this
product
before
releasing
it
with
the
bottomless
pockets
of
the
number
1
brewery
in
the
world
you
should
know
that
they
are
going
to
do
their
research
and
put
put
out
the
best
product
they
can
dont
be
fooled
by
the
low
cost
when
it
comes
to
light
beers
ab
knew
what
they
where
doing
bringing
this
out
long
before
bud
light
or
select
enjoy
a
cold
natural
light
and
be
happy
you
saved
a
few
of
your
hard
earned
d
nothing
special
but
no
major
flaws
its
is
a
crisp
cold
and
refreshing
highly
carbonated
inexpensive
gatorade
alternative
very
good
macroswill
beverage
i
do
not
believe
it
is
possible
to
get
wasted
drinking
nl
theres
just
not
enough
abv
ive
probably
shotgunned
24
of
these
in
24
hour
period
without
success
d
its
a
last
resort
beer
rjt
d
i
give
it
a
2
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
carbonation
hides
most
of
the
flavor
of
the
beer
thus
slightly
easier
to
chug
down
i
would
still
probably
gag
if
i
had
to
drink
more
of
that
crap
though
great
beer
if
you
want
to
get
wasted
the
high
point
of
this
beer
is
its
alcohol
content
i
remember
being
disappointed
when
i
got
this
for
free
at
frat
parties
in
my
early
college
years
im
not
sure
this
deserves
to
be
called
beer
ive
tasted
na
beers
that
were
better
than
this
but
this
beer
brings
back
memories
and
has
never
let
me
down
at
9am
on
gameday
d
some
people
could
throw
these
down
30
a
night
but
this
would
be
hard
to
stomach
for
along
time
d
not
very
flavorful
even
for
the
style
goes
down
easily
and
not
too
filling
since
there
isnt
a
lot
to
the
beer
very
mild
kick
its
poundable
because
of
its
lack
of
substance
but
overall
its
not
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
thin
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thick
fizzy
white
head
and
very
little
lacing
smells
of
corn
and
some
little
grain
and
hops
extract
tastes
of
sweet
corn
and
a
little
grainy
goodness
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
and
it
is
watery
drinkability
is
fair
the
beer
certainly
has
its
place
d
it
claims
to
be
a
pilsner
on
the
label
so
i
will
review
it
as
such
boring
and
insipid
i
can
see
why
folks
go
for
this
just
trying
to
get
a
buzz
its
so
innocuous
because
its
basically
alcoholic
seltzer
water
i
usually
drink
natty
light
from
the
can
on
camping
trips
and
such
when
i
look
at
it
in
the
glass
the
unimpressive
beer
is
even
more
unimpressive
looks
like
some
type
of
contaminated
water
as
pale
yellow
as
pale
can
get
with
just
a
faint
white
fizzy
ring
on
top
kind
of
like
the
ring
that
is
around
the
moon
before
it
snows
is
it
really
there
not
really
much
aroma
its
not
bad
its
not
good
its
not
there
as
the
beer
warms
in
might
smell
kind
of
metallic
probably
from
the
can
for
what
it
is
i
dont
think
its
a
bad
tasting
beer
its
cheap
and
taste
like
it
but
its
not
repulsive
too
me
it
taste
like
cheerios
mouthfeel
is
as
thin
bodied
as
a
beer
can
get
i
like
natty
light
as
a
beer
to
sit
around
the
campfire
and
shoot
the
bull
with
the
buds
and
its
like
3
bucks
a
6
pack
to
boot
we
used
to
pound
these
all
day
in
college
when
we
were
too
broke
to
afford
anything
decent

the
taste
is

not
much
going
on
here
not

would
not
buy
again
and
other
than
that
theres
really
nothing
left
to
review
nothing
to
it
one

mouth
nothing
to
write
home
about
cheap
and
plentiful
a
yard
work
beer
d
as
drnkable
as
water
i
think
the
best
method
to
drink
these
is
to
poke
a
hole
in
the
can
and
shotgun
them
then
you
actually
get
a
foamy
head
at
the
end
this
beer
is
both
d
this
is
a
little
below
average
drinker
for
the
style
the
sweetness
really
kills
the
beer
for
me
but
i
can
see
why
people
like
it
flavors
are
overall
weak
and
the
abv
makes
it
low
enough
to
drink
a
ton
of
it
the
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
faint
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
barely
any
hops
and
a
dry
finish
the
taste
is
below
average
its
obviously
loaded
with
adjuncts
and
only
has
enough
malt
for
a
pale
coloring
and
a
faint
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
quick
and
easy
with
a
dry
finish
its
crisp
and
clean
with
little
beer
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
average
its
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
adjunct
laden
light
lager
its
nothing
id
revisit
soon
but
it
does
the
trick
for
people
who
drink
macro
lagers
and
are
looking
for
a
lighter
choice
this
was
a
beer
that
i
used
to
drink
very
frequently
in
college
when
my
friends
and
i
sampled
the
whole
assortment
of
cheap
beers
this
was
the
one
we
settled
in
with
as
our
most
purchased
variety
it
was
the
most
tolerable
easiest
to
drink
cheap
without
bad
beer
face
but
only
by
virtue
of
its
taste
being
so
weak
as
to
be
somewhat
better
than
overchlorinated
city
water

will

this
much
the
same
way
i
reviewed
bud
light
in
the
sense
that
i
will
not
waste
time
with
a
proper
rating
this
is
a
poor
college
student
beer
of
all
the
poor
college
student
beers
it
is
the
poorest
when
you
have
ten
bucks

whats
the
point
in
even
reviewing
garbage
i
ask
myself
when
the
idea
floats
into
mind
to
try
these
useless
inferior
drinks
but
alas
sometimes
you
are
forced
to
have
half
a
cup
of
this
sort
of
nonsense
at
a
bbq
simply
while
waiting
for
the
good
beers
you
brought
for
yourself
to
cool
down
it
look
slike
straw
yellow
seltzer
water
smells
like
grain
and
adjunct
tastes
like
they
added
just
the
most
remote
level
of
adjunct
possible
to
some
water
to
produce
the
slightest
hint
of
a
flavor
and
the
body
oh
the
body
so
thin
you
wonder
what
sort
of
alchemy
produced
a
liquid
thats
lighter
than
water
i
decided
to
have
just
a
little
bit
of
this
because
i
though
hey
what
the
hell
i
can
review
it
on
ba
and
wont
be
so
thirsty
waiting
for
my
stone
and
flying
dogs
to
cool
id
rather
have
just
stayed
thirsty
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
thin
body
the
carbonation
is
active
and
helps
the
beer
but
its
still
not
good
this
beer
is
little
more
than
an
alcohol
delivery
system
and
not
particularly
good
at
that
d
when
you
are
absolutely
broke
and
still
want
to
drink
something
that
is
a
small
step
above
malt
liquor
and
fortified
wines
for
people
who
hate
the
taste
of
beer
only
drinkability
this
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
can
easily
put
like
10
down
in
a
night
nothing
wrong
with
the
drinkability
i
have
had
different
beers
in
the
fridge
at
the
same
time
and
found
myself
reaching
for
a
nl
over
them
sometimes
it
just
feels
right
really
a
legend
on
campuses
nationwide
for
many
this
is
the
ultimate
priceconscious
beer
although
keystone
is
much
better
it
smells
rank
looks
crappy
and
feels
like
when
you
take
a
drink
and
there
is
a
hair
in
your
beverage
seriously
it
just
doesnt
feel
right
the
drinkability
is
there
because
the
taste
is
ignorable
if
you
chug
it
quickly
and
in
large
quantities
allinall
stay
away
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
it
did
take
years
of
exposure
to
this
beer
through
college
to
be
able
to
tolerate
it
d
dont
expect
me
to
drink
it
again
worst
beer
i
have
reviewed
final
thoughts
this
beer
has
to
be
the
worst
to
sit
down
and
drink
one
of
not
comparing
it
to
other
more
flavorful
beers
it
is
still
difficult
to
drink
compared
to
other
light
adjunct
lagers
this
is
a
cheap
party
beer
college
students
are
saved
by
this
beer
and
it
certainly
has
its
place
in
drinking
games
to
get
people
drunk
in
any
other
sense
of
the
beer
world
natural
light
is
not
worth
it
strapped
for
cash
and
need
a
cheap
drinking
beer
busch
light
is
the
same
price
in
bottles
go
for
that
instead
d
can
drink
like
water
enjoy
it
no
but
i
could
have
a
ton
so
if
youre
looking
to
get
drunk
or
relive
those
college
days
this
is
your
beer
overall
i
am
happy
i
am
brewing
my
own
and
no
longer
drinking
this
well
you
could
honestly
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
which
has
happen
before
this
has
no
taste
and
is
only
for
mass
consumption
so
to
the
review
is
this
really
a
beer
looks
like
a
water
with
one
tip
of
a
tea
bag
in
it
smell
gets
a
1
5
only
because
it
hardly
has
a
smell
the
taste
of
butt
if
i
knew
what
that
tasted
like
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
its
highest
values
because
if
your
overall
goal
is
to
get
wasted
on
a
summer
afternoon
in
college
then
youve
arrived
at
your
beer
for
cheap
entertainment
from
the
smell
to
the
aftertaste
it
is
terrible
it
tastes
nothing
like
beer
it
is
bottled
and
cheap
thats
about
it
no
hop
aroma
or
taste
prolly
none
used
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
the
body
of
the
beer
is
super
light
the
finish
what
finish
the
beer
truly
taste
like
water
with
some
chemical
malt
and
corn
additives
dont
know
why
my
dumb
brother
wanted
me
to
review
this
beer
korean
store
next
door5sixpack
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
that
hasnt
been
said
i
grew
up
on
this
and
im
sure
a
lot
of
other
members
have
as
well
being
in
a
frat
right
now
this
is
still
all
i
ever
see
at
parties
so
since
ive
turned
21
i
have
been
bringing
my
own
6
packs
to
them
not
really
a
beer
to
sit
around
and
drink
its
made
for
a
purpose
to
get
poor
college
students
drunk
i
hate
it
but
love
it
at
the
same
time
but
i
will
never
buy
again
with
my
own
money
for
its
price
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
spend
about
3
more
and
you
can
make
a
much
better
purchase
note
drinking
this
beer
in
a
bottle
can
be
equated
to
wearing
a
tuxedo
tshirt
you
are
trying
to
be
formal
but
really
youre
there
to
get
drunk
if
you
are
on
a
really
tight
budget
then
by
all
means
spend
an
extra
3
a
30pack
and
get
a
real
light
beer
miller
lite
hey
i
am
a
st
louis
area
native
but
this
is
just
not
a
good
beer
at
all
not
much
to
add
just
read
the
other
reviews
and
you
will
hear
words
like

this
is
an
exceptional
beer
if
you
prefer
to
get
a
cheap
buzz
and
a
great
alternative
to
keystone
light
or
miller
high
life
coors
knockoff
and
millers
knockoff
respectively
this
beer
is
the
best
of
the
worst
and
also
has
the
best
price
among
its
foul
tasting
competitors
d
i
traded
a
pbr
to
one
of
my
brothers
for
one
of
these
so
i
could
review
it
people
in
the
house
go
through
this
stuff
like
crazy
on
the
weekends
so
i
figured
trading
was
better
than
buying
a
whole
case
of
this
crap
i
remember
drinking
this
as
a
freshman
when
i
first
came
to
school
and
thinking
that
it
wasnt
half
bad
my
how
my
taste
has
evolved
even
at
less
than
50
cents
a
can
i
wouldnt
buy
this
theyd
need
to
pay
me
to
drink
it
lots
stale
yellow
coloring
with
no
head
whatsoever
a
strong
alcoholic
watery
aroma
that
is
as
inviting
as
a
public
bathroom
stall
watery
taste
with
smooth
floral
notes
initially
evolves
into
a
stale
drink
aftertaste
weak
carbonation
of
a
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
balance
well
with
the
uninteresting
taste
a
feeble
attempt
for
a
beer
but
an
american
college
legend
nonetheless
bonus
points
for
the
nostalgia
but
not
something
youd
find
in
my
fridge
these
days
well
unless
were
having
a
hurricane
party
d
easy
to
drink
not
much
to
it
no
flavor
watery
in
terms
of
cost
per
unit
flavor
this
abomination
is
seriously
expensive
cant
believe
i
used
to
think
fairly
highly
of
it
in
college
has
the
natural
light
changed
or
just
me
the
drink
is
thinbodied
with
a
tickle
of
carbonation
great
drinkability
in
situations
where
refreshment
is
the
objective
and
any
real
flavor
or
substance
a
hindrance
the
beer
of
choice
during
my
college
years
but
havent
really
touched
it
since
it
definitely
is
a
college
kid
beer
saying
ive
had
it
many
times
just
doesnt
tell
the
story
i
cant
bring
myself
to
say
too
many
bad
things
about
this
beer
so
many
good
times
where
fueled
by
the
naty
light
for
what
its
worth
i
preferred
it
over
busch
and
you
simply
cannot
beat
the
price
however
i
just
dont
think
i
could
even
stomach
this
anymore
the
palest
of
yellows
this
is
also
a
pale
reflection
of
what
a
beer
should
be
tons
of
foam
upon
pouring
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
cap
that
leaves
surprisingly
nice
lacing
a
faint
aroma
like
cornflakes
no
malt
no
hops
no
anything
alcoholic
water
weak
it
tastes
like
unfulfilled
dreams
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
aroma
was
cereal
grains
and
not
much
else
taste
was
also
of
cereal
grains
but
light
and
refreshing
and
no
aftertaste
texture
was
watery
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
this
is
a
light
body
beer
with
not
much
flavor
but
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
fishing
trips
one
can
pound
a
lot
of
these
and
not
feel
much
natural
light
is
one
of
those
beers
with
sentimental
value
to
me
the
first
beer
i
have
tasted
perhaps
it
is
still
the
most
common
beer
that
i
see
people
drink
obviously
due
to
its
price
i
have
found
natural
light
to
be
so
unbearable
for
me
now
a
days
that
even
on
a
90
degree
day
on
the
beach
with
100
humidity
i
find
myself
turning
down
natty
sad
but
everyone
has
to
grow
up
i
suppose
drinkability
an
easy
session
beer
simply
kill
5
as
fast
as
possible
wait
10
minutes
and
then
youre
fine
to
drink
them
all
night
i
drank
one
of
these
from
a
halfempty
case
left
by
partying
college
kids
at
a
neighborhood
beach
presumably
the
abandoned
it
accidentally
this
beverage
is
very
pale
in
color
and
has
virtually
no
smell
or
taste
it
feels
like
water
going
down
the
chute
if
youre
thirsty
it
may
be
better
than
nothing
but
ill
stick
with
my
bottle
of
spring
water
for
the
college
kids
only
over
21
without
a
developed
taste
for
malt
and
hops
this
may
be
a
good
way
to
chill
with
friends
i
grew
up
on
this
stuff
so
got
used
to
it
but
then
after
getting
the
early
college
years
i
quickly
switch
to
a
minimum
of
miller
products
as
my
cheap
alternative
this
stuff
is
hardly
beer
in
my
opinion
but
it
will
get
you
drunk
for
a
very
cheap
ticket
something
like
1315
w
michigan
deposit
for
a
dirty
thirty
30
pack
of
next
day
regrets
so
watery
and
highly
carbonated
this
is
my
exact
opposite
picture
of
what
a
beer
should
be
the
only
way
i
drink
this
now
and
days
is
if
its
free
to
me
im
utterly
desperate
or
the
only
other
option
is
busch
light
ahh
d
this
can
be
drank
and
is
by
a
devoted
crowd
of
poor
college
kids
i
am
not
impressed
in
fact
im
disappointed
in
myself
for
drinking
this
forgot
how
bad
this
beer
was
last
time
i
had
it
was
about
4
years
ago
in
college
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
not
much
of
a
head
looks
like
water
with
some
pale
ale
mixed
in
smells
like
grain
and
well
nothing
taste
is
bland
and
nearly
nonexistent
aftertaste
is
pretty
awful
though
im
not
sure
this
can
be
classified
as
beer
but
i
suppose
it
has
to
be
since
they
check
your
id
when
you
buy
it
verdict
this
is
about
as
nofrills
as
a
beer
can
get
its
cheap
and
goes
down
like
water
which
is
why
its
so
popular
on
college
campuses
but
theres
no
beer
enjoyment
to
be
found
still
at
12
bucks
for
a
30
pack
i
guess
you
could
do
worse
avoid
like
the
plague
d
i
grabbed
one
of
these
from
my
buddys
fridge
the
other
night
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
rating
it
i
honestly
dont
know
how
he
plans
to
get
through
the
other
11
ah
natty
unbeatable
at
8
a
case
basically
water
with
a
slight
amount
of
flavor
from
rice
and
weak
grains
only
redeeming
factors
are
lots
of
carbonation
and
the
price
tag
the
8
people
that
listed
this
in
their
got
section
for
beer
trading
should
be
shot
rjr
at
least
its
cheap
and
doesnt
pretend
to
be
something
it
isnt
for
that
reason
natty
puts
some
respect
points
in
my
book
but
thats
about
it
drinkability
great
for
house
parties
well
appropriate
for
house
parties
college
house
parties
this
is
a
cheap
buzzdrunk
will
buy
again
i
will
probably
never
drink
this
again
even
if
it
is
free
sorry
busch
but
step
it
up
yea
right
drinkability
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
advise
it
i
will
say
they
get
easier
going
down
the
more
you
have
its
only
claim
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
only
because
its
easy
to
chug
however
drink
more
than
2
of
these
and
youre
in
for
a
rough
hangover
and
horrendous
beer
shits
avoid
this
one
unless
your
on
a
seriously
tight
budget
or
its
all
thats
available
even
then
id
find
an
excuse
not
to
imbibe
there
is
a
reason
why
all
my
friend
call
it
nasty
light
what
a
waste
of
aluminum
looks
like
pee
after
you
drink
a
gallon
of
water
smells
like
the
bottom
of
a
sweet
corn
tray
in
a
cafeteria
tastes
of
water
mixed
with
perrier
and
maybe
one
malt
grain
its
good
for
funneling
in
college
to
impress
your
friends
with
how
much
fizzy
water
you
can
drink
d
definitely
not
as
drinkable
as
it
used
to
be
i
dumped
out
the
other
half
you
could
pound
a
lot
of
these
beers
quickly
but
only
if
you
avoid
tasting
them
another
terrible
pale
lager
by
anheuserbusch
i
remember
when
this
first
came
out
and
it
was
advertised
as
the
beer
with
a
taste
for
food
mixing
this
with
food
would
be
vomitinducing
typical
ab
pale
lager
with
little
aroma
or
taste
and
what
taste
it
has
is
chemicalmetallic
overly
carbonated
so
mouthfeel
is
poor
made
for
drunks
with
little
discretionary
income
as
a
beer
connoisseur
i
can
say
that
if
youre
looking
for
the
biggest
bang
for
your
buck
natty
light
is
definitely
the
way
to
go
if
youre
a
starving
college
student
like
myself
you
learn
to
appreciate
it
not
the
best
but
ive
had
worse
very
drinkable
perfect
for
beer
pong
good
ol
college
standby
i
spent
many
of
nights
in
college
doing
12oz
curls
of
this
schwill
its
drinkability
is
superb
because
it
tastes
like
water
as
far
as
standards
this
one
rates
low
but
nostalgia
and
the
many
memorable
nights
and
football
games
i
spent
with
my
natty
i
cannot
talk
bad
about
this
beer
exceptional
tailgating
beer
not
much
taste
not
much
of
a
brew
one
beer
i
will
rate
from
memory
what
a
nightmare
other
than
price
this
beer
has
absolutely
no
reedeming
qualitys
looks
bad
smells
worst
believe
it
or
not
tastes
and
goes
down
worse
than
that
this
beer
is
seriously
seriously
bad
keystone
or
natty
light
neither
would
rather
not
having
anything
to
drink
these
days
awesome
beer
and
awesome
price
this
is
a
college
kids
beer
i
drank
this
all
the
time
in
college
it
was
cheap
and
all
i
could
afford
i
use
to
not
be
able
to
stand
it
at
all
but
after
drinking
so
much
of
it
i
got
use
to
it
this
is
just
a
nothing
special
beer
if
you
want
a
cheap
beer
to
get
drunk
and
play
drinking
games
this
is
a
perfect
beer
no
thanks
a
friend
left
this
brew
here
i
think
i
know
why
all
said
if
you
need
to
get
drunk
drink
it
d
if
you
can
stomach
the
taste
i
guess
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
scott
appearance
was
almost
clear
poured
with
a
tiny
head
had
a
light
smell
almost
like
water
almost
as
flavorful
as
water
thin
like
water
here
is
the
point
water
is
just
as
available
and
also
cheaper
i
have
so
few
things
to
write
about
this
just
because
i
dont
know
how
to
explain
a
flavorless
beer
wow
this
is
a
beer
that
you
cannot
get
into
if
you
were
scrounging
around
for
spare
change
this
one
may
be
a
half
assed
beer
to
get
into
i
cannot
say
it
is
good
but
i
cannot
say
it
is
the
worst
i
could
say
it
is
swill
with
alchohal
and
bahrley
sorry
for
being
a
little
drunk
basically
if
you
want
a
beer
thats
got
no
taste
that
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
is
it
good
for
getting
plastered
for
only
13
for
a
30
pack
but
other
than
that
i
would
avoid
nothing
resembling
beer
at
all
but
so
many
good
memories
there
is
almost
nothing
that
distinguishes
this
from
water
i
am
not
going
to
really
get
it
into
the
beer
i
think
the
fact
that
is
a
substandard
macro
light
lager
on
the
cheap
read
they
make
this
for
people
who
cant
afford
bud
light
should
tell
you
what
to
expect
this
is
smoother
and
not
as
strong
on
the
tongue
than
natty
ice
but
thats
why
it
is
light
i
guess
if
you
want
to
be
able
to
drink
for
a
long
time
wo
feeling
the
effects
mentally
or
financially
this
is
your
beer
one
of
the
beers
of
choice
for
poor
college
students
watery
in
both
texture
and
flavor
it
is
light
in
just
about
every
sense
of
the
word
hardly
any
taste
of
alcohol
which
makes
it
drink
like
water
but
because
of
this
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
buzz
before
your
stomach
fills
up
its
main
attractiveness
is
its
price
which
i
have
to
admit
is
almost
unbelievable
for
my
tastes
however
i
think
its
worth
it
to
spend
the
extra
money
natty
light
has
sunk
my
experience
on
ba
to
new
lows
after
this
experience
i
had
to
break
out
a
bottle
of
eku
28
to
ease
the
pain
so
will
miller
high
life
light
be
enough
to
erase
the
bad
memory
from
tonight
find
out
tomorrow
night
the
second
part
of
the
college
light
invitational
this
has
to
be
the
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
it
has
an
amazing
lack
of
everything
d
honestly
id
only
drink
it
again
for
beer
pong
or
some
other
stupid
drinking
game
a
friend
of
mine
brought
this
over
who
was
obviouslly
trying
to
get
as
much
brew
for
his
buck
as
he
could
nuff
said
this
beer
was
an
absolute
bummer
and
a
bore
at
2
99
for
a
sixpack
i
guess
its
a
decent
sample
if
you
dont
have
too
much
dough
but
for
the
average
consumer
definitely
not
worth
a
try
unless
youre
scrounging
for
coins
trying
to
come
up
with
enough
change
to
buy
anything
to
drink
i
remember
back
in
college
this
was
the
beer
of
choice
for
most
undergrads
living
on
less
than
50
bucks
a
week
if
youre
not
absolutely
broke
dont
even
bother
d
drinkable
only
if
you
are
in
desperate
need
for
a
beer
this
is
definitely
a
college
frat
party
beer
not
much
to
speak
about
just
your
classic
display
of
a
generic
american
lager
apearance
is
yellow
and
fizzy
nose
is
dull
and
stale
taste
is
very
carbonated
and
yeasty
feels
like
youre
drinking
water
finishes
with
a
dry
old
dusty
taste
warning
natty
must
be
consumed
in
mass
consumption
because
you
for
sure
want
those
taste
buds
to
be
deadened
when
this
cold
gold
is
poured
into
your
mouth
an
extremely
cheap
beer
that
isnt
even
worth
buying
when
youre
broke
it
tastes
so
artificial
and
unappealing
i
cant
deny
where
i
came
from
but
i
sure
am
glad
ive
graduated
on
to
more
diverse
beers
this
is
a
very
cheap
light
beer
that
delivers
on
a
watered
down
flavor
the
color
is
a
very
light
yellow
that
is
not
that
appealing
the
aroma
is
very
bland
with
the
pungent
smell
of
cheap
beer
the
taste
is
not
much
better
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
mouthfeel
because
it
is
a
watered
down
light
beer
the
finish
is
not
very
good
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
if
you
are
looking
to
drink
alot
of
beer
for
very
cheap
this
just
might
be
your
beer
drinkable
kinda
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
14
of
one
stay
away
from
this
if
possible
whatever
earlier
this
summer
i
was
sitting
at
the
pool
and
someone
saw
me
drinking
a
genesee
red
he
said
he
would
trade
me
with
one
of
what
he
was
drinking
i
fell
for
it
i
put
this
into
the
cooler
to
rate
at
a
different
time
he
gulped
it
down
straight
from
the
can
commented
on
how
heavy
it
was
some
people
are
just
stuck
in
macroland
for
those
people
this
one
well
tastes
smooth
it
is
what
it
is
how
many
times
have
we
said
that
really
its
not
that
bad
for
a
light
beer
i
dont
care
for
light
beer
but
the
gut
is
getting
outta
hand
so
i
picked
this
up
as
a
spacer
havent
had
it
in
a
couple
years
and
it
really
hasnt
gotten
any
better
ive
always
figured
why
pay
more
for
less
of
a
product
though
like
miller
lite
its
2230pk
bud
light
mich
ultra
etc
they
all
cost
way
too
much
for
what
little
they
are
so
if
youre
gonna
do
light
why
not
go
cheap
i
just
paid
13
75
including
tax
for
a
30pk
and
the
calories
and
carbs
are
just
as
low
even
lower
than
some
lights
it
has
more
flavor
than
alot
of
lights
but
not
the
greatest
flavor
it
is
smooth
i
must
say
and
watery
therefore
very
drinkable
has
that
budab
familiar
flavor
to
me
however
slight
it
is
a
decent
light
if
there
is
such
a
thing
does
the
job
and
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
hits
the
spot
if
youre
a
light
beer
drinker
and
have
never
tried
this
i
doubt
youll
hate
it
and
you
may
even
like
it
better
than
the
big
3s
light
offerings
well
it
is
an
ab
product
so
if
youre
a
bud
light
drinker
give
this
one
a
try
its
clean
smooth
slightly
refreshing
so
is
water
though
happy
drinkin
my
friends
cheers
and
as
we
italians
say
saaalooot
again
any
brew
that
can
be
purchased
in
30packs
probably
isnt
the
most
delicious
beverage
pours
out
a
watery
yellow
with
a
quickly
fading
head
not
appealing
but
in
line
with
most
light
beers
in
the
category
the
smell
is
hops
and
an
acidic
sourness
taste
starts
with
a
buttery
corn
taste
similar
to
other
light
beers
but
then
followed
by
an
acidic
alcohol
tart
afterward
not
very
pleasant
and
probably
one
of
the
worst
light
beer
tastes
overall
with
the
exception
of
the
taste
this
is
in
line
with
other
light
beers
the
taste
however
makes
it
significantly
lower
than
other
beers
on
the
plus
side
its
one
of
the
cheapest
beers
ive
ever
seen
but
drink
at
your
own
risk
d
decent
if
you
must
drink
a
light
beer
this
one
aint
so
bad
pours
an
yellow
fizzy
color
with
a
head
that
doesnt
last
taste
is
somewhat
watery
with
only
a
mild
corn
background
definitely
tastes
like
drinking
fouled
water
for
being
one
of
abs
budget
beers
im
not
too
shocked
if
you
like
your
beers
to
go
down
easy
and
taste
like
nothing
this
beers
for
you
piss
yellow
with
a
112
in
head
that
quickly
disappears
with
hardly
a
trace
an
astringent
odor
of
cereal
with
a
noticeable
absence
of
malt
much
worse
than
bud
regular
my
benchmark
of
poor
beers
if
you
need
a
cheap
light
beer
drink
strohs
they
use
malt
my
high
score
on
drinkability
is
not
for
palatability
it
just
goes
down
fast
the
faster
the
better
overall
not
the
worst
light
beer
i
have
had
but
not
really
recommended
the
downside
if
you
are
into
bigflavor
this
aint
it
it
is
in
noway
comparible
to
a
microbrew
but
it
is
tasty
and
swillable
no
bad
attributes
other
reviewers
have
referred
to
this
as
a
great
college
beer
i
must
agree
serve
cold
the
best
of
the
cheap
crappy
beers
it
has
no
taste
goes
down
smooth
and
gets
you
drunk
anything
positive
someone
says
outside
that
is
clearly
a
lie
great
for
power
hours
great
when
you
want
to
mass
consume
and
dont
feel
like
tasting
anything
an
excellent
college
campus
beer
it
looks
like
macsmack
xvi
is
a
reprise
of
macsmack
iv
in
that
ab
has
barely
edged
out
coors
to
snag
the
coveted
crown
these
are
two
of
the
least
impressive
beers
that
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
every
time
i
see
seemingly
normal
people
fill
their
grocery
cart
with
swill
like
this
i
just
shake
my
head
and
move
on
ive
given
up
trying
to
figure
out
why
this
crap
sells
i
have
no
complaints
although
im
not
sure
what
exactly
is
natural
about
this
beer
it
scores
a
5
on
the
value
scale
i
had
this
with
a
group
of
college
friends
even
did
it
the
honor
of
pouring
it
into
a
glass
what
waste
such
a
bad
beer
it
can
usually
enjoy
bad
beers
in
a
different
way
sometimes
a
budlight
is
ok
that
said
i
wouldnt
choose
them
if
given
an
option
and
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
if
it
was
free
and
i
was
drunk
awful
in
its
lacking
of
anything
usually
i
put
drinkability
high
on
these
beers
because
you
can
pack
them
back
not
this
beer
i
stopped
after
the
first
went
to
food
lion
and
got
something
else
overall
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
a
sad
attempt
to
pass
off
yellow
liquid
with
rice
syrup
as
a
beer
adjuncts
overtake
all
other
flavors
and
no
real
offensive
or
actual
taste
is
really
detected
at
all
thats
all
i
can
say
really
drinkability
not
the
worst
of
the
light
beers
and
cost
effectiness
is
clutch
overal
rather
drinkable
en
mase
one
stream
of
carbonation
sums
up
this
beers
appearance
foamy
head
at
the
start
but
like
most
macro
lagers
this
disappears
pretty
fast
light
light
light
golden
honey
color
smell
is
mostly
grain
taste
is
rice
and
grain
with
a
subtle
sweetness
that
doesnt
go
overboard
like
most
beers
in
this
style
mouthfeel
has
nice
bubbles
and
is
just
right
for
the
style
this
beer
is
much
better
than
i
remember
it
to
be
in
high
school
and
i
could
even
see
this
as
a
go
to
after
something
heavy
easy
all
around
looks
an
odd
yellow
with
hardly
any
bubbles
and
no
head
smells
faint
grain
and
rice
tastes
ricey
with
a
little
sweetness
and
actually
some
malt
towards
the
end
grain
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
prickly
i
could
drink
this
for
a
while
simple
d
putting
these
beers
away
is
not
a
problem
but
it
is
hardly
an
enjoyable
experience
come
on
now
this
is
a
cheap
beer
intended
for
mass
consumption
its
not
meant
to
be
the
best
beer
ever
it
is
however
not
the
worst
beer
ever
either
i
will
definately
take
this
beer
for
free
from
a
friend
whenever
i
have
it
often
the
appearance
is
a
light
straw
yellow
color
with
no
head
retention
smell
and
taste
dont
offer
much
mouthfeel
is
overcarbonated
but
is
it
drinkable
and
worth
the
money
yes
overall
this
beer
ranks
at
the
bottom
1
the
worst
ive
had
besides
lacrosse
light
i
would
buy
natty
ice
over
this
anyday
dont
waste
your
time
not
the
previews
reviews
were
deead
on
when
you
review
this
beer
you
have
to
take
in
consideration
the
fact
that
the
beer
is
made
to
satisfy
college
students
budgetts
in
turn
the
beer
is
pale
pale
yellow
has
aboslutly
no
aroma
to
it
at
all
and
its
very
simialr
to
water
in
taste
i
wouldnt
say
it
taste
bad
more
that
it
just
doesnt
tast
like
anything
there
is
really
almost
no
point
to
reviewing
this
beer
as
it
is
made
for
college
students
strapped
for
cash
that
want
to
get
drunk
fast
college
students
usually
arent
concerned
with
taste
but
ease
of
consumption
and
this
goes
down
easy
obviously
not
for
the
beer
connoisseur
but
perfect
for
its
intended
purpose
natty
is
worth
a
college
student
spending
a
few
bucks
on
poured
a
really
pale
yellow
lots
of
fizz
for
a
bit
then
no
head
smell
is
really
thin
clean
metal
faint
beery
character
the
taste
is
just
so
damn
thin
but
it
is
cold
thats
good
right
anyways
hints
at
some
corny
grain
and
hay
stored
in
metal
clean
taste
that
comes
and
goes
rapid
fire
im
not
one
to
turn
down
a
free
beer
so
as
long
as
im
outside
in
the
sun
and
theres
nothing
else
ill
drink
it
otherwise
barely
beer
it
was
also
very
light
as
promised
on
the
can
the
main
thing
is
that
the
bad
flavors
were
less
prounced
whoo
good
grief
a
lite
straw
pour
with
almost
no
heading
is
not
a
good
start
cooked
veggies
in
the
aroma
and
almost
no
taste
whatsoever
dry
and
unimpressive

but
crap
at
10
for
a
30
pack
what
the
hell
would
ya
expect
the
drinkability
is
ok
if
need
be
you
could
survive
on
this
mk
i
got
this
from
my
fathers
refrig
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
proably
the
most
clear
yellow
color
i
have
ever
seen
with
a
fair
amount
of
head
that
had
the
fastest
retention
i
have
ever
seen
there
was
a
bit
of
lace
that
was
not
sticky
the
smell
was
kind
of
spicy
and
the
taste
was
kind
of
sweet
not
very
good
dont
drink
and
review
d
everyone
says
corn
is
supposed
to
bring
out
the
sweetness
in
a
beer
but
is
that
a
good
thing
still
its
more
drinkable
than
other
light
beers
so
i
guess
natty
light
isnt
half
bad
drank
this
beer
all
the
time
in
college
didnt
really
like
it
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
and
now
i
have
no
problem
drinking
it
the
color
of
this
beer
is
a
decent
pale
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
is
a
potent
hoppy
smell
which
strikes
the
nostrils
immediately
tastes
malty
at
first
but
you
get
used
to
the
taste
decent
mouthfeel
not
too
watery
for
a
light
beer
usually
only
drink
it
when
its
the
best
available
i
was
expecting
a
relationship
here
similiar
to
coors
light
and
keystone
light
those
two
are
very
similiar
to
me
but
this
is
a
unique
beer
from
bud
light
and
i
do
prefer
it
because
its
cheaper
and
doesnt
have
a
foul
aftertaste
if
looking
for
cheap
light
beer
go
with
keystone
light
or
old
milwaukee
light
they
are
easier
to
drink
and
unique
from
other
light
macros
id
say
overall
it
tastes
ok
im
slightly
impressed
it
showed
some
meager
attempt
at
taste
were
it
not
for
the
slightly
malty
flavor
in
the
finish
i
would
have
thought
i
was
drinking
club
soda
when
reviewed
within
the
style
this
beer
is
fairly
average
the
only
thing
is
it
is
a
little
cheaper
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
tonight
for
no
other
reason
than
i
had
a
driver
and
this
was
the
only
thing
in
16oz
cans
i
was
wanting
to
get
a
little
more
than
a
standard
six
and
this
met
that
requirment
pretty
typical
for
the
style
a
camping
session
beer
for
sure
this
worked
for
me
for
2
years
in
college
i
suggest
you
try
it
just
once
if
you
are
broke
or
just
for
laughs
beermail
me
and
let
me
know
if
this
works
for
you
too
well
im
a
college
student
and
as
far
as
cheap
beer
goes
natty
light
is
by
far
the
best
its
also
good
beer
to
have
around
for
women
who
dont
like
beer
since
it
tastes
like
water
it
literally
has
no
beer
taste
to
it
at
all
its
beer
flavored
water
that
will
get
you
drunk
now
that
im
21
ive
started
drinking
good
beers
for
a
change
but
when
i
want
something
cheap
to
chug
natty
is
1
why
pay
45
bucks
more
for
budcoors
etc
if
natty
light
is
11
now
that
i
truely
appreciate
beer
the
naty
light
isnt
all
that
good
anymore
but
i
will
say
its
chugability
is
that
even
a
word
is
excellent
not
to
mention
its
cheap
its
the
best
starter
beer
to
drink
when
your
a
noob
freshman
in
college
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
drinking
games
its
drinkable
in
high
volumes
and
doesnt
have
the
low
abv
of
most
light
beers
the
taste
is
watery
but
has
more
bite
to
it
than
a
coors
light
or
keystone
light
regardless
i
would
avoid
it
unless
youre
on
a
very
tight
budget
or
looking
to
relive
your
college
years
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
give
any
other
reviews
of
the
beer
seeing
as
my
serving
type
or
method
was
the
classic
shotgun
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
on
a
budget
go
natty

natural
light
is
extremely
easy
to
consume
much
like
a
sprite
i
dont
particulary
want
another
one
but
i
probably
will
cheers
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
refreshing
but
still
doesnt
stand
up
at
all
in
the
mouth
carbonation
is
also
a
killer
not
worth
any
more
than
the
slightest
of
efforts
more
good
beer
stores
needed
in
harnett
county
pours
pale
yellow
with
fizzy
white
head
smells
grainy
lots
of
adjucts
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
other
than
vague
graininess
its
not
unpleasant
though
very
light
bodied
i
have
to
give
it
an
average
drinkability
rating
its
not
good
but
its
ok
as
a
session
beer
i
wouldnt
reccomend
it
as
any
type
of
craft
beer
but
its
cheap
and
drinkable
not
to
mention
its
not
really
any
different
from
any
other
light
beer
pours
a
weak
golden
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
of
stale
bread
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
but
is
far
from
impressive
i
drank
this
by
the
gallon
in
college
but
will
now
will
only
drink
it
again
if
nothing
else
is
available
at
the
time
overall
this
is
below
average
beer
because
of
the
beers
price
and
drinkability
it
makes
it
a
staple
at
all
college
parties
would
avoid
if
possible
and
hopefully
never
drink
again
good
old
natty
light
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
and
deserves
the
respect
of
many
this
is
a
great
beer
for
college
parties
and
getting
very
drunk
because
it
is
very
cheap
and
it
tastes
great
in
my
opinion
this
beer
tastes
better
than
most
domestic
beers
and
if
bars
would
put
this
on
tap
i
would
gladly
get
it
everytime
yechh
this
stuff
truly
even
makes
budweiser
look
like
the
king
of
beers
by
comparison
carbonated
pee
would
be
putting
it
nicely
all
i
could
smell
was
the
aluminum
can
and
some
crap
that
was
stuck
in
the
rim
let
the
frat
boys
have
it
or
whatever
socially
challenged
segment
of
the
popultioan
that
likes
hurting
themselves
by
drinking
this
beer
stuck
in
florida
this
week
akll
they
have
is
the
macros
where
i
am
staying
what
the
heck
time
to
revisit
the
old
college
days
natural
light
is
just
that
light
apparance
is
pale
yellow
some
initial
head
and
carbonation
smell
is
mainly
grassy
grains
hmm
lawnmower
brew
taste
is
equally
inspectacular
mouthfeel
is
ok
very
light
duh
east
enough
to
drink
but
lacking
in
the
taste
dept
natty
light
is
a
great
way
to
get
people
turned
off
to
the
beer
world
i
am
just
going
to
forget
i
ever
drank
this
i
picked
it
up
a
can
of
this
as
a
joke
because
my
friend
asked
for
water
to
i
got
both
and
handed
him
the
natty
light
yeah
my
band
just
got
down
playing
a
show
outside
very
hot
and
tired
so
i
didnt
want
to
put
it
back
i
opened
it
up
drank
half
of
it
could
not
stand
it
so
i
poured
it
out
yes
this
beer
lacks
in
so
many
areas
it
looks
like
urine
with
a
smell
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
it
sure
is
offensive
tastes
like
nothing
at
all
very
very
very
light
watery
mouth
feel
with
a
drinkability
that
leads
me
to
be
able
to
choke
one
of
these
down
once
every
5
years
i
had
a
couple
while
watching
the
nba
finals
the
rest
of
the
six
will
be
either
given
away
or
used
as
a
beercan
chicken
stand
i
can
come
up
with
better
ways
to
spend
3
50
than
a
six
of
these
its
an
alcohol
delevery
device
and
nothing
more
waiter
can
i
just
get
a
lemon
water
i
find
these
beers
too
watered
down
yes
light
lagers
will
be
watered
down
by
definition
but
this
is
too
the
extreme
this
beer
has
practically
no
qualities
to
it
like
water
drinkability
as
stated
when
this
is
kept
cold
on
ice
and
consumed
at
a
fairly
quick
pace
this
is
ok
let
one
warm
a
little
well
its
best
to
just
pour
it
out
and
get
another
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
drank
and
i
drank
it
regularly
in
early
college
but
after
a
few
years
of
drinking
more
complex
beers
going
back
i
just
cant
see
how
i
ever
could
drink
it
i
bought
it
for
a
nice
day
at
the
pool
but
even
in
that
situation
it
still
falls
flat
not
recommended
natural
light
pours
a
typical
macro
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
sixteen
ounce
can
smells
like
cheap
beer
in
other
words
adjunct
all
the
way
tastes
like
corn
this
is
lawnmower
beer
only
recommended
for
appropriate
uses
such
as
beer
bongs
and
frat
parties
avoid
i
reluctantly
tried
this
beer
because
some
friends
went
out
and
bought
it
and
there
was
nothing
else
the
color
was
light
straw
yellow
with
a
medium
head
the
aroma
smelled
of
nothing
really
with
a
hint
of
adjuncts
the
taste
was
almost
nonexistant
with
a
light
maltcorn
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
big
surprise
light
with
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
i
honestly
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
ever
again
but
i
suppose
if
youre
a
college
student
who
is
trying
to
get
smashed
for
cheap
this
would
be
a
great
choice
not
good
even
by
cheap
beer
standards
and
dont
worry
if
you
spill
some
on
you
its
only
alcoholic
water
my
oldest
son
just
turned
21
and
this
is
what
he
brought
home
i
thought
i
had
raised
him
better
where
is
the
sierra
nevada
i
asked
about
the
only
thing
going
for
this
beer
is
that
it
is
oh
so
cheap
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
thin
head
smells
of
corn
and
cheap
grains
not
much
in
the
taste
department
either
thin
and
watery
with
just
a
slight
grainy
flavor
this
is
a
brew
for
college
students
all
the
way
may
have
to
up
his
allowance
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
moderate
white
puffy
head
that
very
quickly
vanished
smell
is
on
the
sweetish
side
and
not
particularly
enjoyable
taste
is
very
mild
nonoffensive
because
there
is
so
little
there
taste
does
not
improve
when
it
warms
because
some
strange
sweet
notes
begin
to
appear
refreshing
when
ice
cold
not
very
good
cool
drink
it
fast
while
its
ice
cold
this
coulda
been
worst
i
choose
not
to
wait
long
enough
for
it
warm
i
dare
not
give
it
that
chance
nothing
id
look
for
and
well
worth
the
cost
for
this
can
ones
enough
drinkability
out
of
all
of
the
macro
lagers
perhaps
in
the
2nd
tier
of
beers
considering
the
price
of
the
beer
a
very
good
buy
doesnt
give
me
a
headache
afterwards
and
i
would
recommend
it
for
your
college
parties
the
only
reason
i
am
drinking
this
is
because
it
is
my
father
in
laws
favorite
beer
pours
a
bright
urine
colored
yellow
with
a
fuzzy
white
thin
head
that
falls
almost
immediately
to
thin
fuzz
smells
of
cornbarley
and
cereal
along
with
some
cheap
grainy
adjuncts
tastes
like
watered
down
malty
grain
water
nothing
else
really
present
could
only
drink
ice
cold
to
freeze
my
taste
buds
enough
to
dumb
down
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
mineral
water
drinkability
is
low
maybe
this
is
better
when
youre
already
inebriated
ill
pass
this
beer
makes
no
excuses
or
outlandish
promices
on
the
label
so
i
wont
try
to
sugarcoat
either
from
frat
boys
everywhere
to
high
school
kids
with
no
job
this
is
a
staple
of
young
drinking
lifeyes
it
is
cheap
and
maybe
a
little
to
light
def
the
lightest
light
beer
everfor
my
taste
but
my
friend
let
me
tell
ya
it
will
get
ya
drunk
in
any
case
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
but
it
aint
bad
if
you
need
to
get
a
quick
load
try
a
funnel
or
shotgun
technique
whatever
this
beer
is
exactly
like
any
other
shitty
light
lager
but
has
too
much
carbonation
probably
to
hide
the
sour
skanky
taste
and
has
a
horrible
tincan
flavor
when
drank
from
a
can
add
an
unadmirable
green
apple
taste
to
its
resume
guess
im
not
really
getting
anywhere
good
with
this
i
suppose
i
wouldnt
bitch
too
much
about
knocking
a
couple
back
if
i
was
already
good
and
loaded
but
it
would
be
tough
to
start
the
nightday
with
one
of
these
gross
come
aside
here
for
a
sec
this
is
crap
there
is
much
better
beer
out
there
and
life
is
too
short
to
be
drinking
this
swill
forget
about
the
buzz
for
a
sec
and
consider
buying
a
quality
product
instead
no
amount
of
cheap
beer
is
worth
subjecting
yourself
to
this
so
since
i
am
in
college
this
is
my
standard
beer
at
9
99
a
24
pack
ive
finally
got
the
courage
to
review
it
usually
i
start
out
with
some
good
beers
and
go
to
this
but
i
always
tell
myself
that
im
drinking
water
appearence
is
a
light
straw
color
and
it
smells
like
dirt
and
cooked
rice
there
is
a
huge
bubbly
head
at
first
that
dissapates
rapidly
it
tastes
like
water
no
hops
or
malt
just
plain
gross
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
i
rank
this
a
2
5
in
drinkability
because
it
is
comparable
to
water
and
makes
a
great
session
beer
if
you
dont
have
much
cash
overall
this
is
a
nasty
beer
i
cant
wait
til
i
get
a
good
paying
job
yeah
i
know
i
was
slumming
it
but
i
want
to
sample
and
rate
all
beers
including
this
horrible
concoction
this
is
one
of
the
most
lifeless
looking
beers
ive
ever
seen
pale
straw
with
a
small
white
fizzy
quickly
diminishing
head
typical
adjunct
smell
that
is
bland
and
stinks
of
cooked
vegetables
the
taste
is
bland
not
as
horrible
as
i
expected
but
still
not
good
by
any
means
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
watery
and
lifeless
you
can
tell
that
this
beer
was
made
to
be
cheap
period
yes
it
is
very
inexpensive
but
its
still
not
worth
it
save
this
stuff
for
the
college
freshman
parties
natty
is
a
beer
i
drink
almost
every
week
it
brings
back
so
many
good
memories
being
a
poor
college
student
with
a
limited
budget
natural
light
has
become
a
staple
of
my
diet
under
15
for
a
30
pack
i
cant
resist
not
a
great
tasting
beer
but
for
the
money
it
will
do
i
recomend
anyone
with
little
or
no
money
give
it
a
try
at
least
some
drinks
are
described
as
astringent
as
they
make
your
mouth
feel
almost
puckered
this
does
that
but
not
through
any
particular
quality
of
the
drink
but
more
becuase
of
the
pure
nasty
of
the
taste
it
is
sour
in
a
way
entirely
seperate
from
anything
palatable
bitter
in
entirely
unnatural
ways
and
even
when
poured
into
a
glass
retains
a
metallic
tang
that
dominates
the
character
of
the
beer
this
is
also
the
only
beer
i
have
ever
encountered
that
tastes
exactly
the
same
no
matter
what
state
it
or
the
taster
is
in
whether
roomtemperature
or
nearfrozen
whether
tasted
while
stonecold
sober
or
3
sheets
to
the
wind
the
beer
hearkens
to
the
fermented
sweat
of
lucifer
hopped
with
only
the
finest
brimstone
and
sulfur
abandon
hope
all
ye
who
enter
here
basically
this
is
a
completely
unoffensive
and
extremely
boring
beer
big
thumbs
down
i
really
am
not
sure
what
the
brewmasters
of
this
beer
were
going
for
when
they
discovered
natty
but
i
think
that
they
did
a
good
job
of
making
a
really
cheap
shitty
popular
among
college
students
beer
that
pulls
in
alot
of
profit
it
tastes
like
carbonated
water
with
a
little
beer
flavoring
added
the
metal
taste
from
the
can
actually
enhances
the
taste
it
tastes
even
worse
when
poured
into
a
glass
because
the
aluminum
flavor
is
taken
away
this
beer
is
the
very
definition
of
cheap
swill
i
really
tried
hard
to
drink
this
with
a
straight
face
but
i
simply
couldnt
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
and
it
looked
like
water
with
a
slight
amount
of
piss
or
something
light
yellow
in
there
not
really
any
head
or
carbonation
showing
smelled
nothing
tasted
nothing
i
got
out
a
glass
of
water
and
drank
them
side
by
side
almost
no
difference
im
not
joking
terrible
stuff
might
be
good
for
beer
pong
if
youre
too
poor
to
buy
busch
light
or
high
life
this
is
not
good
surprisingly
natilight
may
actually
be
better
than
a
lot
of
abs
beers
not
because
its
better
tasting
beer
its
because
the
bad
flavors
are
less
pronounced
here
than
in
many
other
of
their
beers
having
said
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
it
has
a
vague
yellow
color
overcarbonated
and
cannot
retain
a
foamstand
has
almost
no
presence
to
the
nose
flavors
are
nill
slight
and
i
do
mean
slight
grain
flavor
and
metalic
tones
everything
disapears
to
a
watery
gulp
absolutely
nothing
in
the
finish
or
aftertaste
my
advice
drink
only
when
free
and
nothing
better
is
within
a
days
drive
i
have
5
words
to
describe
this
beer
seltzer
water
in
a
can
this
beer
taste
like
carbonated
water
with
a
faint
taste
of
alcohol
i
seriously
had
to
drink
about
12
beers
to
get
anywhere
close
to
where
i
wanted
to
be
ill
tell
you
i
had
to
whizz
about
a
good
15
times
that
night
if
you
want
to
drink
a
beer
dont
waste
your
time
with
this
water
in
a
can
have
a
natural
ice
or
be
a
big
boy
and
have
a
good
ole
steel
211
leave
this
beer
to
the
amateurs
note
regardless
of
this
beers
low
ranking
from
me
it
does
have
its
place
this
beer
is
a
good
bet
for
beer
pong
and
beer
bongs
both
of
which
are
better
when
you
dont
have
to
worry
about
caring
much
about
the
beer
youre
drinking
an
almost
transparent
yellow
color
with
a
one
finger
head
goes
from
white
fizz
to
busy
carbonation
almost
instantly
and
leaves
no
lacing
light
watery
body
very
faint
off
malt
smell
mostly
adjunct
metallic
offtaste
is
just
about
the
only
flavor
but
its
wide
availability
and
low
price
make
it
a
staple
of
american
college
keg
parties
drinkability
it
doesnt
actively
offend
so
you
could
do
worse
lack
of
beerlike
charactaristics
however
make
this
one
strictly
for
the
nonbeer
drinker
taste
borders
on
the
ultralight
i
e
mich
ultra
bud
select
drinkability
i
am
happy
to
have
reviewed
this
college
classic
even
if
i
would
always
find
something
else
with
more
bang
for
my
buck
take
it
easy
boys
and
girls
consumed
straight
from
the
can
white
foam
bubbled
up
as
i
cracked
open
the
tab
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
carbonation
provides
some
texture
toward
the
back
of
the
tongue
thin
grainy
taste
with
some
residual
sweetness
weak
hop
flavor
is
detectable
toward
the
back
finish
is
dry
and
weak
with
some
more
of
the
lingering
grainy
taste
that
was
present
upfront
a
terribly
bland
light
beer
a
friend
on
mine
from
florida
thought
itd
be
nice
to
remind
me
what
it
was
like
back
in
the
boons
i
got
to
pour
it
out
in
a
flimsy
plastic
cup
and
im
not
sur
if
it
was
transparent
or
not
but
it
was
sure
close
even
with
its
overly
fluffy
useless
smelly
head
it
smelled
like
preserve
or
something
i
cant
place
it
i
guess
if
its
server
near
freezing
you
wont
notice
it
has
no
friggin
taste
id
be
better
off
using
it
as
solvent
water
thin
at
best
really
bad
beer
amazing
i
ever
had
some
even
years
ago
and
didnt
notice
12
oz
can
born
on
5905
served
chilled
in
a
mug
pours
about
the
palest
yellow
you
can
get
and
its
topped
with
a
2
finger
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
metal
and
ass
in
the
aroma
almost
no
flavor
except
for
the
adjunct
and
metal
this
is
an
itll
get
you
drunk
beer
but
thats
about
it
drinkability
from
my
past
college
years
ive
heard
this
beer
called
beast
repeatedly
im
not
sure
if
its
quite
that
offensive
maybe
the
hangovers
are
but
i
can
barely
call
it
beer
this
is
something
that
frat
boys
need
to
practically
freeze
and
drink
very
quickly
as
if
its
a
malt
liquor
if
you
want
a
light
beer
stick
to
something
better
like
sam
adams
light
comments
crisp
pretty
clean
and
refreshing
its
a
shame
a
beer
with
these
positive
characteristics
still
falls
flat
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
is
popular
on
college
campuses
when
there
are
cheaper
beers
out
there
that
taste
better
i
tried
to
pass
it
off
to
the
wife
as
an
example
of
a
blonde
ale
she
looked
at
it
smelled
it
sipped
it
and
said
its
ok
i
guess
tastes
like
a
regular
lager
she
had
even
less
of
it
than
i
did
and
left
it
on
the
counter
i
was
so
proud
of
her
shes
coming
right
along
on
this
clandestine
beer
appreciation
project
decent
for
cheap
alcoholic
bliss
as
bland
as
beer
gets
cheers
despite
how
crappy
this
beer
is
it
is
actually
very
drinkable
its
really
cheap
and
goes
down
like
water
low
abv
makes
it
easy
to
drink
all
night
after
a
few
it
really
does
taste
like
water
if
you
drink
a
lot
of
it
just
beware
that
it
has
been
known
to
cause
a
stomach
condition
on
the
following
day
known
as
the
natty
splatties
in
a
12
oz
can
not
exactly
willing
to
pour
this
as
its
a
swill
and
drop
beer
i
try
not
to
smell
it
often
but
it
does
have
a
metallic
nose
that
fights
somewhat
with
its
negligible
grain
scent
the
taste
is
more
bite
that
it
is
hops
and
malt
the
beer
is
light
on
the
flavors
it
should
have
and
not
at
all
smooth
a
staple
at
psu
fraternity
parties
and
what
one
must
drink
if
they
want
to
drink
for
free
one
of
the
palest
beers
i
have
ever
seen
seltzerlike
carbonation
nonoffensive
cheap
alternative
to
bud
light
etc
surprisingly
drinkable
and
refreshing
lowcal
if
you
are
worried
about
that
sort
of
thing
pros
cheap
light
refreshing
cons
boring
macrobrew
pitifully
plain
flavorless
not
offensive
slight
metallic
taste
low
on
the
typical
cooked
veggie
somehow
clean
and
crisp
like
drinking
a
beer
flavored
water
a
hot
beach
a
cooler
and
a
lawnchair
certainly
one
cant
be
bringing
any
olde
schoool
barleywhine
to
the
beach
unless
they
want
to
wake
up
floating
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
ive
never
experienced
mich
ultra
and
thats
kin
but
this
truly
tasted
like
beer
seltzer
water
least
it
didnt
give
me
a
splitting
tummy
ache
like
it
did
the
last
time
i
drank
it
5
years
ago
or
more
natural
light
goes
down
very
smoothly
so
i
think
it
has
an
aboveaverage
drinkability
quotient
perfect
for
outdoor
drinking
on
a
scorchin
hot
day
but
not
a
brew
that
you
would
serve
if
youre
trying
to
impress
a
beer
snob
i
honestly
do
not
understand
the
fascination
w
this
absolute
shitty
beer
it
seems
its
almost
always
this
college
parties
it
sucks
maybe
its
because
i
dont
flock
to
light
beer
like
every
single
other
spineless
american
but
there
are
so
many
other
beers
out
there
for
the
same
price
if
youre
gonna
go
w
cheap
beer
get
pabst
of
evil
eye
or
something
dont
torture
yourself
w
awful
light
beers
overallis
this
beer
doesnt
have
any
beer
characteristics
cheap
buzz
is
all
its
good
for
drink
em
like
water
or
get
a
real
beer
my
friend
if
drinkablity
means
being
able
to
swig
this
swill
all
night
long
with
no
regrets
in
the
morning
its
a
five
well
maybe
not
the
no
regrets
part
if
drinkability
means
being
able
to
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
all
night
long
well
yeah
drinkability
more
drinkable
than
beast
and
stone
for
what
its
worth
seriously
though
this
is
just
as
bad
as
busch
light
and
corona
light
they
all
reek
of
fermenting
cereal
grains
and
rat
shit
and
its
actually
a
wonder
why
they
taste
like
water
and
not
sewage
this
is
quite
possibly
the
worst
american
beer
on
the
planet
i
realize
many
people
grow
up
on
this
stuff
and
everyone
needs
to
start
their
beer
drinking
somewhere
but
this
shit
is
rancid
i
myself
used
to
drink
this
stuff
by
the
bucket
in
my
early
college
days
and
in
hindsight
i
should
have
just
taken
shots
of
something
and
saved
myself
the
trouble
the
beer
as
it
pours
from
the
12
ounce
aluminum
can
forms
a
transparent
gold
color
with
a
bright
white
head
and
the
lace
a
very
thin
sheet
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
all
malt
sweet
fresh
and
crisp
to
the
senses
start
is
lightly
sweet
some
malt
noticed
the
top
is
cadaverous
finish
has
a
benign
acidity
the
hops
negligible
very
dry
guess
its
better
than
dying
of
thirst
but
only
barely
its
not
easy
to
be
worse
than
natty
ice
but
this
beer
has
done
it
the
quality
is
bottom
of
the
barrel
clear
light
yellow
with
absolutly
no
head
the
smell
was
non
existant
the
taste
was
very
much
like
rice
and
a
bit
of
a
ginger
ale
taste
i
couldnt
finish
the
whole
thing
nasty
stuff
drinkable
there
is
nothing
offensive
or
endearing
about
this
brew
at
all
original
review
32702
the
absolutely
lightest
beer
i
have
ever
drank
nearly
see
through
in
presentation
in
the
glass
after
being
poured
i
couldnt
find
much
flavorwise
other
than
a
very
very
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
i
do
mean
slight
i
actually
poured
out
what
was
remaining
as
i
just
tasted
bitter
water
and
well
the
vernors
ginger
ale
in
the
refrigerator
was
calling
me
frat
boy
beer
bonging
beer
at
best
natural
light
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
no
little
to
no
head
the
smell
is
downright
potent
i
cant
tell
what
it
is
but
it
smells
like
rotten
steak
the
taste
is
what
you
would
expect
very
little
watery
with
a
few
hops
present
in
your
mouth
in
has
no
pizazz
tastes
like
water
the
only
reason
to
buy
this
beer
is
for
a
cheap
buzz
and
a
weekend
camping
trip
you
can
pick
up
a
case
for
9
bucks
so
you
can
see
why
it
is
still
around
this
is
a
college
mans
beer
great
for
drinking
games
very
unimpresive
yellow
with
minimal
head
smell
is
equally
unimpressive
when
ice
cold
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
the
idea
with
this
beer
is
to
drink
it
fast
because
it
is
hard
to
take
down
as
it
warms
the
only
reason
to
drink
this
disgreace
of
a
beer
is
to
get
a
cheap
buzz
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
if
your
looking
for
an
inexpensive
refreshing
macro
the
color
and
head
retension
leave
something
to
be
desired
but
where
i
live
the
closest
place
to
buy
beer
is
15
miles
away
and
very
expensive
so
i
often
turn
this
direction
to
save
money
for
a
more
desireable
micro
or
import
it
is
going
to
be
hard
to
come
up
with
ways
to
expound
upon
worst
beer
ever
when
attempting
to
describe
this
brine
because
i
think
that
about
says
it
all
calling
this
beer
watery
is
an
insult
to
water
light
fizzy
gold
color
with
a
weak
white
head
youll
find
as
much
lacing
with
this
beer
as
you
would
with
a
pair
of
velcro
sneakers
aroma
of
mineral
water
weak
borderline
insulting
flavor
and
no
finish
at
all
why
anyone
would
try
to
explain
the
virtue
of
being
able
to
buy
30
cans
of
this
to
get
hammered
for
a
low
price
is
beyond
me
spend
a
dollar
more
and
get
a
beer
with
a
bit
of
flavor
that
actually
has
some
alcohol
in
it
if
that
is
your
game
there
is
simply
no
reason
for
this
to
exist
drank
this
straight
from
the
can
i
was
given
no
i
didnt
buy
it
tastes
metallic
and
grainy
doesnt
do
a
lot
for
the
tastebuds
the
carbonation
is
more
overpowering
than
the
flavor
its
just
swill
anyway
another
i
would
say
dont
buy
to
why
is
there

this
beer
is
the
stuff
fratboys
vomit
is
made
of
this
beer
is
quite
pungent
with
a
odor
like
no
other
it
smells
sort
of
like
a
dumpster
at
a
very
popular
bar
i
cant
believe
people
actually
drink
this
crap
after
a
glass
full
i
cant
take
anymore
color
is
like
any
other
cheap
domestic
beer
golden
and
clear
i
feel
sick
now
and
dont
think
i
need
to
continue
this
review
any
further
my
opinion
is
that
this
brew
is
undrinkable
pour
it
down
the
drain
and
save
yourself
from
a
horrible
experience
this
is
quite
possibly
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tried
to
drink
i
think
it
is
the
second
beer
in
my
life
that
i
poured
down
the
drain
because
i
couldnt
gag
it
down
the
experience
is
a
loser
from
first
pouring
this
pale
yellow
almost
headless
i
found
little
smell
so
that
makes
the
smell
rate
a
little
higher
than
any
other
category
the
taste
was
terrible
this
didnt
even
taste
like
beer
it
tasted
like
what
you
would
get
if
you
poured
beer
through
a
dirty
beer
rag
and
then
rung
it
out
in
your
glass
i
didnt
keep
it
in
my
mouth
long
enough
to
determine
if
it
even
had
a
mouthfeel
it
was
undrinkable
this
was
my
college
student
daughters
attempt
to
bond
with
me
by
bringing
me
home
what
they
drink
at
the
frat
parties
please
dear
no
more
favors
of
this
kind
hopefully
shell
never
read
this
review
on
tap
at
the
last
keg
party
i
went
to
palest
of
yellows
natural
light
looks
as
if
someone
took
half
a
pint
of
beer
and
half
a
pint
of
water
and
mixed
them
together
the
smell
was
that
of
corn
and
slight
metallic
hints
it
tastes
thin
and
crisp
but
almost
no
flavor
totally
bland
ugh
never
again
finish
is
nonexistant
with
nary
a
palate
memory
left
another
lousy
light
beer
nothing
else
to
say
natty
light
drank
this
at
a
family
outing
this
is
one
hell
of
a
light
beer
i
must
have
had
20
cans
without
even
noticing
its
piss
yellow
color
and
flavor
to
match
went
down
easy
without
getting
bloted
not
much
head
or
carbonation
for
that
matter
this
is
one
ice
cold
can
drinker
beer
sixth
category
memories
grand
salad
days
but
never
again
natty
light
surprisingly
in
the
area
im
from
natty
is
around
but
plays
second
fiddle
to
beast
i
think
its
because
natty
is
more
watery
than
beast
and
most
likely
the
people
who
buy
natty
are
buying
it
to
get
drunk
and
not
for
its
taste
honestly
the
only
time
ive
ever
poured
this
beer
was
into
little
plastic
cups
for
drinking
games
but
as
i
recall
it
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
no
head
and
decent
carbonation
it
smells
of
corn
rice
and
filler
it
has
a
faint
bitterskunk
taste
not
from
hops
this
isnt
because
i
got
a
skunk
caseits
part
of
the
beers
flavor
honestly
its
very
watered
down
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
the
taste
just
isnt
there
so
its
difficult
to
enjoy
if
you
graduate
college
and
still
purcahse
this
you
had
either
be
making
payments
on
a
ferrari
and
consequently
have
no
for
beer
or
living
with
your
parents
and
still
looking
for
one
of
them
things
they
call
jobs
but
it
serves
its
purpose
and
there
are
worse
things
out
there
this
brew
had
a
mild
to
no
aroma
a
light
yellow
pour
with
next
to
no
head
some
lacing
as
the
glass
is
tilted
tastes
like
a
budweiser
to
me
thats
probably
an
insult
but
so
is
the
beer
no
wonder
i
once
thought
all
american
beer
was
bad
after
it
warms
the
aroma
becomes
even
more
noxious
but
as
a
faithful
ba
i
must
sample
all
beers
can
i
have
another
sinebrychoff
porter
please
i
have
to
wash
this
swill
down
this
beer
when
poured
into
my
glass
had
a
large
white
frothy
head
with
small
bubbles
that
fully
diminished
there
was
some
lacing
with
this
beer
and
very
little
carbonation
was
observed
there
was
very
little
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
watery
anyhow
witness
exhibit
a
in
the
prosecution
of
macro
pale
lagers
as
piss
i
havent
consumed
piss
to
my
knowledge
but
if
ever
there
were
a
beer
that
ressembled
urine
in
appearance
this
must
be
it
its
drinkable
for
sure
but
there
are
a
couple
things
you
have
to
think
about
1
why
bother
and
2
drink
it
before
it
gets
warm
because
itll
be
brutal
on
your
senses
otherwise
i
was
at
a
wedding
reception
and
this
is
all
that
they
had
on
tap
i
never
had
it
so
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
i
was
not
impressed
it
poured
a
bright
yellow
gold
color
with
a
head
that
was
gone
with
the
blink
of
an
eye
there
was
much
carbonation
however
it
looked
like
ginger
ale
it
tasted
like
seltzer
water
i
really
could
not
taste
much
flavor
at
all
i
would
be
able
to
drink
many
of
these
because
it
was
like
water
however
i
would
not
want
to
absolutely
awful
very
light
appearance
and
a
skunky
smell
this
beer
tastes
very
watered
down
and
just
wont
go
down
for
me
i
have
never
been
able
to
drink
more
then
2
and
i
dont
think
i
ever
will
be
able
to
out
of
all
the
low
end
beers
this
one
takes
the
taco
hey
another
ab
product
that
is
terrible
allow
me
a
moment
to
act
surprised
this
is
another
bad
beer
poured
from
the
can
a
pale
yellowbrown
colour
dirty
toilet
water
mutated
dog
saliva
i
dont
know
smelled
weak
what
was
detected
was
of
course
corn
tasted
at
best
tolerable
no
malts
no
hops
little
corn
lotta
chemicals
but
nothing
that
will
make
you
vomit
terribly
carbonated
mouthfeel
little
watery
definitely
a
macro
light
beer
sure
you
can
pound
back
a
few
of
these
but
why
switch
to
something
more
enjoyable
or
dont
drink
at
all
natty
light
is
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
it
gets
the
job
done
and
thats
all
that
matters
sure
it
doesnt
go
down
as
smooth
as
others
but
to
be
quite
honest
i
prefer
it
over
other
beers
like
bud
light
its
not
as
bad
as
everyone
says
natty
light
is
the
poormans
drink
and
thats
the
bottom
line
what
can
i
say
this
is
natty
and
it
is
not
a
beer
drinkers
beer
this
is
a
beer
for
college
students
and
homeless
alcoholics
very
very
watery
taste
not
worth
drinking
unless
you
get
it
for
free
do
yourself
a
favor
and
dont
pour
it
into
a
glass
it
will
probably
scare
you
away
from
it
where
to
begin
i
cant
think
my
buddy
claimed
that
this
is
the
most
drinkable
beer
on
the
planet
i
avoid
this
one
like
the
plague
as
for
the
shitty
lights
this
one
is
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
spectrum
bordering
not
even
worth
drinking
for
a
buzz
my
advice
to
anyone
who
is
drinking
beer
just
to
feel
good
stick
with
your
bud
heavy
if
you
gotta
go
light
keystone
maybe
shit
they
all
suck
natural
light
just
walk
down
grant
or
mcclaine
in
morgantown
and
you
will
see
this
beer
just
about
every
place
you
look
it
seems
unescapable
down
here
well
my
roomate
had
a
party
over
the
weekend
and
he
offered
me
a
leftover
beer
according
to
him
this
beer
isnt
bad
and
that
he
doesnt
mind
it
well
it
appears
a
fizzy
yellow
not
gold
yellow
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
leaving
drops
of
lace
around
the
glass
with
each
sip
the
aroma
has
a
very
adjunct
ridden
aroma
but
it
is
almost
bearable
due
to
some
detectable
sweetness
i
dont
think
this
beer
has
any
hops
in
it
when
it
comes
down
to
it
this
beer
is
carbonated
water
flavored
with
beer
if
they
sold
a
beer
flavoring
this
would
be
it
very
dumbed
down
in
flavor
aroma
and
appearance
designed
for
one
thing
mass
consumption
its
not
horrible
tasting
just
there
is
nothing
here
worth
tasting
so
i
guess
for
ten
bucks
a
case
this
continues
to
be
my
peers
drink
of
choice
the
mouthfeel
is
seltza
water
definitely
a
poorly
made
beer
that
i
could
never
have
the
urge
for
and
why
drink
a
ton
of
this
stuff
all
it
will
leave
you
is
a
bad
hangover
and
a
bloated
stomach
pass
on
the
shitty
beer
if
your
trying
to
get
drunk
and
grab
a
bottle
of
liquor
some
jagermeister
treats
me
much
better
than
a
case
of
natty
ok
so
this
is
my
first
review
on
the
site
and
being
a
college
student
i
thought
i
should
use
the
one
beer
that
is
most
dear
to
me
i
know
everyone
trashes
this
beer
and
no
its
not
a
good
beer
but
when
pitchers
are
2
50
you
cant
pass
it
up
very
pale
clear
in
color
rank
smellshould
definately
keep
it
in
the
can
so
you
dont
get
a
nosefull
and
it
tastes
like
water
however
it
also
goes
down
like
water
and
is
perfect
for
when
drinking
a
lot
or
on
hot
days
i
think
i
could
take
a
water
bottle
of
it
when
i
run
so
overall
no
its
not
a
beer
id
crack
open
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
but
occasionally
for
the
price
its
hard
to
beat
oh
my
god
i
laugh
at
every
redneck
in
standing
in
front
of
me
at
the
store
buying
this
crap
for
6
99
a
12
pack
in
cans
this
is
straight
piss
for
people
who
cant
afford
anything
else
if
you
have
the
extra
3
at
least
get
a
12
pack
of
michelob
pure
toilet
water
good
day
drinkablity
i
guess
if
i
was
damn
thirsty
it
was
hotter
then
hell
out
and
somebody
had
just
spit
in
my
mouth
i
might
choose
this
beer
over
a
glass
of
cold
iced
t
or
water
for
the
sole
reason
that
the
alcohol
in
the
beverage
would
do
a
better
job
at
killing
all
of
the
harmful
bacteria
from
the
foreign
spit
i
am
going
to
give
this
beer
a
generous
2
5
across
the
board
for
the
simple
fact
that
it
is
what
fueled
my
freshman
year
of
college
it
has
very
little
taste
at
all
and
it
is
very
cheap
as
well
my
friends
and
i
buy
case
after
countless
case
of
this
stuff
to
satisfy
are
drinking
needs
when
we
are
broke
i
buy
the
good
stuff
when
i
can
but
it
is
nice
to
know
there
is
always
a
twelve
of
natty
waiting
for
me
edit
i
like
the
low
carbs
and
the
fact
that
this
beer
was
made
not
to
be
amazing
but
to
be
a
light
straight
forward
brew
i
enjoy
it
on
hot
summer
days
i
drink
it
on
cold
winter
nights
this
is
a
cheap
light
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
i
know
many
will
not
agree
with
me
and
thats
fine
but
i
can
work
with
this
brew
its
not
great
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
this
is
not
a
pleasant
beer
to
consume
there
will
be
no
joy
in
mudville
tonight
if
this
is
all
there
is
this
product
as
imported
into
canada
in
a
quart
bottle
pours
out
very
light
with
minimum
head
that
disapates
to
nothing
it
actually
appears
to
be
water
after
sitting
for
5
minutes
the
taste
is
very
thin
with
a
slight
bitterness
which
actually
gives
it
a
slight
bit
of
character
ah
yes
natty
light
the
official
beer
of
poor
college
students
i
think
that
this
is
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
if
you
like
water
and
want
to
look
cool
by
holding
a
can
of
beer
granted
down
in
my
home
state
of
sc
they
are
keepin
it
real
by
donateing
a
share
of
the
dinero
to
the
ace
basin
water
conservation
program
so
that
is
kosher
in
my
book
even
though
they
dont
get
much
money
from
me
anyways
to
the
taste
it
brings
a
line
from
one
of
my
favorite
poemsiron
maiden
songs
water
water
everywhere
and
not
a
drop
to
drink
thats
right
its
water
with
some
yellow
stuff
in
it
and
some
alcohol
in
it
if
you
really
want
something
that
bad
just
strain
rubbing
alcohol
through
a
dirty
sock
and
get
the
same
effect
one
of
the
best
session
beers
ive
ever
had
i
can
drink
this
stuff
all
night
yet
it
has
a
plain
taste
and
color
it
didnt
taste
bad
because
it
didnt
taste
at
all
its
like
tasting
water
what
is
there
to
taste
if
its
getting
messed
up
you
want
id
take
bud
light
or
keystone
light
over
this
they
arent
much
better
but
at
least
in
my
experience
not
as
hard
on
the
belly
my
rating
says
it
all
watery
appearance
no
aroma
or
taste
worth
noting
mouthfeel
is
just
as
watery
as
it
looks
got
stuck
with
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
party
hosted
by
people
who
have
no
clue
about
beer
i
actually
couldnt
finish
it
which
says
volumes
because
im
usually
not
one
to
turn
down
a
freebie
im
not
sure
if
its
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
because
it
has
lots
of
competition
but
its
got
to
be
close
pours
just
barely
yellow
and
ultra
clear
i
mean
nearly
as
clear
as
pure
water
it
produced
a
soap
bubble
type
head
that
is
not
impressive
at
all
the
smell
is
grainy
with
a
touch
of
sweet
skunk
whatever
that
is
the
head
is
gone
now
that
i
typed
that
and
i
can
type
fast
lots
of
bubbling
action
a
lemony
wang
at
first
taste
and
watered
down
something
or
another
just
not
much
there
resembling
beer
light
bodied
well
actually
extremely
watery
well
its
hard
to
say
but
cheers
anyways
its
another
hot
and
humid
day
with
the
temperature
at
ninety
six
degrees
and
this
macro
is
hitting
the
spot
i
really
dont
think
that
this
beer
was
meant
to
be
picked
over
i
get
the
impression
that
this
beer
is
meant
to
have
its
top
popped
and
just
thrown
back
for
the
pure
enjoyment
of
its
being
a
cold
wet
conservatively
priced
beer
anyway
this
is
the
cheapest
beer
ive
bought
so
far
at
around
3
50
for
six
bottles
this
beer
solely
exists
for
poor
saps
who
want
to
get
wasted
but
it
isnt
too
bad
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
maybe
if
it
were
ice
cold
it
would
be
somewhat
drinkable
but
as
it
warms
up
the
slightest
bit
it
starts
tasting
nastier
and
nastier
very
light
in
color
body
hard
to
get
a
whole
can
of
this
down
really
but
if
your
goal
is
cheap
beer
that
will
get
you
drunk
then
i
guess
this
one
would
fit
that
bill
okay
the
continuation
of
confessions
in
my
drinking
of
budweiser
at
friends
parties
i
have
had
this
on
occasion
i
consider
this
to
be
worse
than
bud
light
which
is
practically
water
i
wish
the
macros
would
get
light
beer
down
before
i
have
to
worry
about
my
weight
i
didnt
buy
this
it
was
offered
today
under
a
clear
blue
sky
and
warm
sunny
conditions
i
drank
a
sixer
and
just
got
tired
if
you
can
believe
it
this
was
my
first
try
at
natty
light
there
are
a
lot
of
cheap
swill
beers
that
are
better
so
why
even
bother
it
does
slide
down
pretty
easy
though
for
a
crap
beer
deserving
of
the
top
spot
of
worst
beers
nattie
light
is
truly
the
staple
of
college
campuses
everywhere
cheap
beers
are
usually
pretty
bad
and
nattie
is
no
different
yet
nattie
light
is
the
best
of
the
worst
its
a
college
party
beer
thats
it
and
although
it
looks
really
strange
nattie
light
does
come
in
a
bottle
you
usually
will
be
questioned
because
it
looks
all
sophisticated
wow
nattie
in
a
bottle
dont
be
fooled
though
when
you
thought
it
couldnt
get
any
worse
it
does
out
of
the
bottle
stick
with
that
trashy
silver
can
and
before
you
know
it
you
will
be
able
to
pound
plenty
of
this
swill
no
hows
that
for
a
succinct
review
this
beer
lacks
any
redeeming
qualities
whatsoever
wait
i
suppose
that
it
could
give
sparkling
water
a
run
for
its
money
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
an
odd
grain
aroma
and
a
subdued
head
very
little
flavor
just
a
faint
note
of
hops
at
the
finish
and
stinging
carbonation
i
cant
stand
bad
beer
i
refuse
to
drink
crappy
beer
theres
no
point
in
wasting
your
money
on
bad
beer
when
you
can
get
drunk
for
less
on
cheap
liquor
that
being
said
when
the
beer
has
no
flavor
and
goes
down
like
water
it
makes
it
better
than
most
bad
beers
at
least
i
can
get
it
down
without
my
gag
reflex
being
triggered
budweiser
and
southpaw
light
trip
the
reflex
around
the
last
third
of
the
canbottlecup
and
im
being
serious
notes
wheres
the
beer
light
beers
are
light
beers
but
this
is
on
the
verge
of
not
even
being
beer
disgustingly
horrible
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
displeasure
of
trying
ok
beer
not
a
big
fan
of
diet
beer
super
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
tad
bit
better
than
bud
light
thats
about
it
not
bad
not
good
serves
the
purpose
on
a
hot
day
as
good
as
any
other
domestic
light
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
that
thins
to
less
than
a
lace
smells
gross
like
every
other
adjunct
lager
has
a
surprising
nice
taste
for
this
type
of
beer
goes
down
pretty
smooth
a
little
dry
overall
not
too
bad
but
not
good
enoug
to
buy
again
wouldnt
drink
this
again
even
if
it
was
free
solid
low
calorie
beer
my
personal
favorite
if
i
want
to
diet
pours
a
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
just
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
little
lacing
is
seen
spotty
at
best
lots
of
carbonation
the
aroma
isnt
much
of
anything
really
just
some
grass
and
sweet
corn
the
taste
is
well
horrible
talk
about
a
watereddown
brew
taste
this
would
be
it
actually
the
taste
is
very
light
of
grain
with
a
slight
sweet
corn
finish
that
is
a
tad
on
the
dry
side
o
just
not
worth
brewing
or
drinking
99
calories
of
watery
brew
i
get
that
this
is
something
people
go
for
but
its
not
for
me
yeah
another
great
idea
by
ab
tthis
beer
has
something
other
than
a
sweet
grain
taste
note
canned
on
31313
no
purpose
i
started
drinking
this
beer
when
i
was
on
a
low
carb
diet
it
fit
the
bill
for
me
to
a
t
smooth
easy
maybe
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
with
a
taste
that
isnt
offensive
it
is
the
perfect
diet
beer
miler
lite
to
me
is
bitter
with
a
tang
and
offensive
coors
is
like
water
as
is
bud
55
at
least
this
beer
has
some
taste
and
will
give
me
a
buzz
a
lot
of
the
other
premium
light
beers
arent
light
at
all
select
gives
you
the
right
balance
between
caloriecarbs
and
taste
o
no
real
flavor
or
smell
like
most
light
lagers
surprisingly
not
offensive
at
least
and
99
calories
is
decent
for
slumming
it
with
crap
beer
o
overall
just
another
bud
product
thats
lacking
any
good
flavor
not
offensive
but
not
good
overall
overly
carbonated
and
lacking
in
any
complexity
surprise
this
is
a
typical
adjunct
light
lager
its
crisp
lightly
flavored
ultimately
unoffensive
and
goes
down
easily
and
quickly
status
quo
for
adjunct
light
lagers
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
not
bad
for
what
its
trying
to
be
for
lower
calories
and
less
offensive
taste
this
is
where
i
go
not
quite
as
good
as
mich
ultra
for
low
calories
but
solid
still
not
a
craft
beer
and
not
one
that
i
drink
unless
im
drinking
a
lot
of
em
overall
theres
nothing
special
to
say
about
this
beer
its
definitely
drinkable
but
its
just
your
common
light
lager
id
like
it
better
if
the
carbonation
was
a
little
lower
over
all
cold
and
refreshing
not
a
beer
that
i
would
want
to
drink
everytime
i
felt
like
a
beer
but
it
would
be
perfect
after
cutting
the
grass
on
a
hot
day
meh
meh
meh
meh
meh
meh
meeeh
meh
mehmehmehmehmehmehmehmehmehmehmeh
meeehhh
meh
meh
meh
meh
meh
meh
meh
meh
actually
scratch
that
never
mind
this
beer
sucks
pretty
hard
no
meh
about
it
can
looks
cool
though
especially
when
you
shake
it
up
and
shoot
it
with
a
pellet
gun
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
white
fizzy
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
smell
of
corn
and
faint
hops
tastes
the
same
and
typical
macrobrew
funk
very
thin
bodied
like
water
i
actually
prefer
budlight
to
this
but
thats
not
saying
much
pours
a
pale
straw
with
a
starch
white
half
finger
of
fizzy
boring
looking
head
really
have
to
snort
at
this
one
to
gather
much
of
anything
corn
and
sweet
subtle
grains
wet
grass
slight
metallic
zing
in
front
with
a
corny
bread
flavor
as
it
fades
mouthfeel
is
akin
to
urine
overall
youre
better
off
drinking
soda
straw
colored
and
clear
with
a
very
thin
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
very
light
and
mostly
light
malt
and
some
bready
biscuity
notes
flavor
is
not
very
offensive
but
not
good
either
mostly
light
malt
and
breads
no
bad
aftertaste
or
bitterness
which
is
nice
from
this
genre
refreshing
light
body
and
high
carbonation
better
than
budweiser
but
still
a
budweiser
beer
pours
light
straw
golden
with
a
wispy
head
aroma
from
this
beer
is
difficult
to
pick
up
but
i
detect
adjunct
sweet
like
corn
syrup
in
the
flavor
i
wasnt
able
to
detect
any
presence
of
hops
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
little
flavor
and
what
is
there
is
not
enjoyable
overall
drinkability
not
offensively
bad
just
thoroughly
boring
overall
perhaps
in
not
giving
this
beer
a
fair
shake
based
on
how
cold
it
was
and
my
predisposition
towards
macros
but
still
its
bland
thin
and
not
tasty
though
i
might
have
a
worse
opinion
if
it
was
served
at
room
temp
ill
take
a
boston
lager
over
this
every
minute
of
everyday
over
this
bud
select
is
much
better
than
regular
bud
at
least
to
me
but
common
lets
face
it
there
is
not
much
a
brewery
can
do
to
mix
up
an
american
style
adjunct
lager
its
pretty
basic
appearance
is
yellowgold
with
decent
carbonation
and
head
to
start
and
then
if
fades
quickly
smell
and
taste
contain
grainbarley
and
some
hops
mouthfeel
is
fine
its
not
gross
tasting
but
its
not
noteworthy
overall
its
drinkable
in
a
pinch
i
wounder
if
roles
were
reversed
meaning
ipas
were
as
marco
as
adjunct
and
the
general
population
trying
the
adjunct
for
a
first
time
if
reactions
to
this
style
would
be
different
its
better
than
bud
light
and
miller
light
but
i
think
id
still
rather
have
a
bud
o
less
awful
than
many
of
the
other
budweiser
variants
still
wouldnt
have
this
again
its
easydrinking
and
full
of
aroma
and
flavor
for
a
light
beer
poured
this
can
into
a
plastic
cup
it
poured
a
plae
straw
color
and
it
has
very
nice
clarity
it
produced
a
pathetic
white
head
with
horrible
head
retention
little
to
no
lacing
aroma
what
aroma
i
think
i
might
have
smelled
a
grain
yes
a
grain
the
taste
of
this
light
lager
is
almost
no
existent
if
there
is
a
taste
of
malt
or
grain
or
hops
it
is
barely
existent
what
is
this
crap
rjt
d
yea
this
sure
is
not
worth
my
time
o
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
but
that
is
mostly
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
and
waterlike
consistency
overall
its
not
an
offensive
beer
it
just
has
no
flavor
except
corn
and
some
grain
i
dont
recommend
this
its
definitely
not
worth
the
money
o
it
kinda
sucks
not
good
but
not
offensive
either
i
really
wasnt
able
to
come
up
with
anything
special
about
this
beer
to
me
in
still
just
budweiser
in
a
different
bottle
so
with
that
being
said
this
beer
is
yellow
in
color
malts
and
corn
aromas
on
the
nose
the
head
fades
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
design
on
the
label
thats
about
it
for
a
light
beer
its
ok
not
much
flavor
or
body
nothing
special
easy
to
put
down
but
for
what
reason
this
beer
is
really
bad
worse
than
anything
else
ive
had
from
budweiser
it
has
nothing
to
offer
other
than
reduced
calories
in
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
budlight
gone
wrong
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
had
two
more
after
this
first
one
and
didnt
think
twice
about
pounding
them
will
be
drinking
again
for
sure
overall
wow
i
really
need
to
keep
craft
brew
in
the
house
at
all
time
she
can
not
bring
this
in
anymore
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
go
to
beers
it
is
refeshing
after
working
on
a
hot
day
or
mowing
the
yard
it
has
to
be
one
that
you
go
to
when
it
is
your
first
that
day
or
when
your
only
other
option
is
a
bmc
light
version
it
has
a
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
my
fathers
beer
choice
but
doesnt
get
worse
until
the
third
one
over
all
there
are
thousands
more
that
are
better
but
if
your
looking
for
an
economical
and
lower
calorie
choice
then
this
is
the
best
that
is
out
there
of
the
light
beer
choices
i
dont
keep
it
in
my
fridge
since
my
palate
ahas
developed
suckers
are
born
every
minute
taste
better
the
more
you
drink
or
really
i
should
say
its
easier
to
stomach
d
easy
to
drink
like
water
boring
and
bland
i
had
this
the
other
day
while
drinking
with
my
non
craft
buddy
his
little
2
year
actually
was
his
beer
bitch
running
to
get
these
all
day
so
it
made
me
reconsider
kids
for
a
split
second
anyway
drank
directly
from
the
can
going
old
school
the
aroma
actually
isnt
that
bad
its
lightly
skunky
but
more
sweet
corn
and
some
hops
come
through
the
taste
was
better
than
expected
as
well
slightly
skunky
but
really
just
light
sweetness
with
hops
i
crushed
one
of
these
and
would
drink
a
few
of
these
if
i
had
too
not
bad
poured
a
glass
resulting
in
a
two
finger
head
of
pure
white
foam
that
faded
to
a
small
ring
around
the
glass
in
seconds
lace
is
broken
but
does
cling
color
is
a
2
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smells
like
wet
corn
and
malt
taste
is
bland
flavors
of
wheat
corn
and
malt
with
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
water
has
about
the
same
mouthfeel
as
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
lack
luster
flavor
and
feel
i
guess
its
only
grace
is
it
is
plentiful
and
cheap
this
is
another
beer
to
mow
and
play
golf
with
it
is
good
for
that
at
least
i
usually
have
this
in
cans
when
i
do
have
it
and
it
tastes
fine
smells
ok
drinks
well
and
is
cheap
and
easy
to
find
it
is
like
the
rest
of
these
mass
produced
beers
i
would
drink
it
again
dvery
thin
feeling
even
for
a
light
lager
might
as
well
drink
water
though
me
not
being
a
jerk
i
wont
complain
or
turn
it
down
if
a
friend
offers
me
one
summary
this
is
a
bad
beer
i
gave
it
a
6
010
or
a
d
the
word
select
in
the
title
enticed
me
to
try
it
but
after
reading
99
calories
underneath
that
i
knew
this
wasnt
going
to
be
an
exceptional
beer
for
a
premium
beer
this
beer
really
has
no
taste
and
is
as
consistent
as
water
it
comes
off
as
a
slightly
better
version
of
bud
light
the
only
saving
grace
is
the
99
calories
but
i
would
rather
just
run
on
a
treadmill
for
30
minutes
and
drink
a
good
beer
i
would
only
drink
this
beer
again
if
there
was
nothing
better
available
overall
find
a
better
light
lager
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
would
i
want
a
sixer
of
this
nope
the
abv
is
low
enough
that
a
sixer
plus
is
very
doable
i
would
pick
this
out
of
my
choice
of
mainstream
light
lagers
though
for
what
it
is
worth
pours
a
sickly
looking
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
soapy
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
grain
and
corn
maybe
a
little
yeast
tastes
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
although
nothing
is
really
prominent
enough
to
pick
out
other
than
some
corn
or
rice
high
carbonation
thin
mouthfeel
low
drinkability
quite
nasty
awful
this
beer
just
smells
from
moldly
boiled
rice
and
has
no
scent
of
alcohol
pale
yellowish
color
no
head
no
lacing
and
almost
clear
makes
me
wonder
why
i
am
drinking
this
the
flavor
is
mostly
like
a
bitter
moldy
rice
soda
the
beer
if
flat
avoid
pours
as
if
someone
put
two
drops
of
yellow
food
coloring
inside
of
a
glass
of
water
pours
with
a
bit
of
white
head
but
that
quickly
recedes
into
nothing
and
leaves
zero
lacing
smells
like
a
stale
loaf
of
bread
in
between
slices
of
cardboard
tastes
about
the
same
although
thankfully
tames
it
down
a
bit
feel
and
drinkability
is
about
the
same
as
carbonated
water
drinkability
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
drink
something
like
this
like
water
due
to
the
almost
complete
lack
of
smell
taste
and
aftertaste
as
far
as
wanting
to
drink
it
its
fairly
boring
found
this
for
fifty
cents
at
a
local
bait
shopgeneral
store
during
mans
weekend
a
pour
results
in
a
clear
jaundice
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
shortlived
white
suds
the
nose
comprises
corn
corn
syrup
and
hard
water
the
taste
is
nearly
identical
though
the
calcium
from
the
hard
water
is
intensified
a
bit
and
some
aluminum
foil
is
added
for
good
measure
the
body
is
rather
light
with
a
heavy
moderate
carbonation
and
a
relatively
easygoing
feel
overall
not
the
worst
thing
ive
put
in
my
mouth
but
not
something
id
generally
go
after
at
a
bar
or
something
without
a
harsh
lack
of
choice
about
it
light
bodied
pale
appearance
probably
not
bad
if
youre
at
an
outside
event
in
the
broiling
sun
nothing
proffered
nothing
rejected
the
absence
of
anything
to
critique
makes
this
one
unfair
fight
drink
it
if
you
just
dont
care
and
you
wont
know
any
better
drinkability
if
you
can
drink
sparkling
water
you
can
drink
this
its
not
offensive
in
any
way
just
very
bland
with
little
to
no
flavor
fizzy
feel
to
it
taste
is
watered
down
bud
grainy
and
musty
not
sure
why
anyone
would
drink
this
if
you
want
low
calories
hit
the
ice
water
ok
this
is
one
of
the
better
ab
brews
and
it
still
isnt
very
good
although
it
is
better
than
regular
budweiser
i
would
not
recommend
to
anyone
to
spend
their
hard
earned
money
on
one
of
these
but
if
youre
at
a
party
and
all
they
have
is
this
stuff
and
its
free
go
for
it
other
than
that
keep
on
moving
spend
your
6
on
lottery
tickets
or
charity
this
beer
has
a
little
more
heaviness
than
regular
bud
which
is
a
slight
plus
however
its
still
a
very
bland
faintly
cornflavored
beer
if
not
poured
right
youll
get
a
ton
of
head
from
all
of
the
carbonation
its
pretty
much
as
pale
of
an
amber
as
you
can
get
without
being
yellow
smells
of
corn
as
well
as
tastes
like
it
while
better
than
their
light
beers
its
still
nothing
great
d
like
all
bmc
this
beer
is
made
with
drinkability
in
mind
that
being
said
there
are
other
ab
products
i
prefer
if
you
are
sticking
to
this
brand
appears
smells
and
has
the
same
mouthfeel
as
every
other
american
light
beer
ive
tried
before
its
body
however
is
a
little
fuller
than
the
rest
so
i
would
place
this
one
a
bit
higher
if
we
were
comparing
apples
to
apples
for
those
nights
i
feel
like
reliving
the
fantasy
days
of
college
and
taking
down
a
twofour
then
this
the
one
for
me
its
a
good
choice
for
beer
pong
ive
discovered
more
beer
with
fewer
calories
but
i
will
never
order
one
of
these
at
a
bar
or
pop
one
open
to
enjoy
on
my
veranda
d
to
be
honest
it
reminds
me
of
a
retired
ab
offering
bud
dry
in
fact
all
that
comes
to
mind
relative
to
this
beer
is
why
ask
why
try
bud
dry
drinkability
overall
it
seems
like
carbonated
water
that
has
gone
bad
on
the
plus
side
i
guess
it
is
drinkable
budweiser
select
is
a
light
beer
brewed
by
anheuser
busch
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
4
1
budweiser
select
is
lighter
than
bud
light
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
these
smell
is
sweet
with
some
grains
and
malts
the
taste
is
bold
but
smooth
you
pick
up
on
the
grains
and
malts
in
this
brew
budweiser
select
has
a
good
taste
for
a
light
beer
this
beer
dose
go
down
nice
real
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
light
smooth
and
refreshing
i
would
have
a
budweiser
select
over
bud
light
any
day
good
light
beer
anheuserbusch
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
5
out
of
5
in
the
end
its
a
rather
bland
beer
that
smells
bad
but
makes
up
for
it
slightly
with
good
drinkability
and
a
nice
low
calorie
count
poured
from
12
oz
can
into
mug
color
is
slightly
darker
than
the
average
light
beer
and
the
head
slowly
dissipates
leaving
no
lacing
slight
smell
of
flowers
but
nothing
else
either
bad
or
good
there
initial
taste
is
of
metal
and
carbonation
slightly
skunky
as
well
after
the
first
few
sips
taste
become
that
of
the
smell
not
a
whole
lot
either
bad
or
good
overall
decent
for
what
it
is
its
rather
inoffensive
in
most
categories
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
pale
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
not
impressive
smells
like
some
grain
and
mostly
water
taste
the
same
why
is
this
even
produced
mouthfeel
is
as
thin
as
anything
i
have
had
before
over
carbonated
some
metallic
aftertaste
from
a
bottle
yuck
well
as
some
people
on
here
have
said
i
hate
bud
light
i
think
it
has
a
sharp
unpleasant
taste
that
continues
to
astonish
me
as
to
how
people
drink
it
so
often
budweiser
is
decent
but
far
from
the
top
that
being
said
bud
select
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
i
have
no
trouble
drinking
of
course
2
25
for
a
25
oz
mug
here
at
a
bar
in
plantation
fl
landlubbers
raw
bar
for
all
you
broward
folks
who
may
read
this
helps
but
regardless
it
is
something
im
having
an
easier
time
tolerating
than
i
was
expecting
the
foamy
head
is
actually
pretty
impressive
although
its
a
25
ouncer
not
a
pint
but
still
the
taste
is
a
tolerable
mix
of
corn
hops
and
carbonation
but
not
an
overpowering
sharpness
that
i
get
from
bud
light
it
seems
to
me
that
bud
select
is
very
unappreciated
among
the
beer
buyers
because
although
this
isnt
top
of
the
line
it
certainly
beats
out
bl
and
honestly
id
rather
have
this
than
budweiser
also
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the

my
pour
resulted
in
two
fingers
worth
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
exploding
with
co2
bubbles
that
fell
like
a
souffle
when
the
door
is
banged
closed
it
did
leave
some
nice
lacing
as
a
parting
gift
though
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
neplus
clarity
it
gave
me
xray
vision
allowing
me
to
see
through
walls
nose
was
an
unholy
combo
of
metallic
cereal
and
a
light
lagerish
sweetness
as
a
reminder
of
what
could
have
been
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
bland
watery
taste
in
the
mouth
full
flavor
read
the
can
and
yet
i
found
myself
wondering
full
of
what
finish
was
equally
bland
and
boring
it
is
not
that
this
tasted
bad
or
foul
it
just
did
not
taste
at
all
oof
completly
lacking
in
flavor
for
any
style
this
beer
is
very
light
and
only
has
a
slightly
bitter
taste
only
a
small
metallic
taste
why
would
anyone
drink
this
always
good
to
warn
a
fellow
beer
drinker
when
you
happen
to
sip
someone
elses
crappy
beer
tastes
mostly
like
water
with
a
little
bit
of
corn
but
more
than
the
corn
is
a
metallic
blood
flavor
if
you
were
to
play
some
beer
pong
i
guess
this
wouldnt
be
a
horrible
choice
i
was
not
impressed
by
the
color
or
texture
of
the
beer
but
it
is
not
all
about
appearance
it
has
a
good
smell
but
quite
weak
it
has
a
really
similar
taste
to
bud
light
cant
tell
much
difference
in
the
two
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
that
is
not
over
powering
with
carbonation
and
its
drinkability
is
rather
nice
it
goes
down
quite
well
and
is
rather
refreshing
from
a
light
beers
point
of
view
it
is
defintley
a
decent
beer
i
still
prefer
bud
light
taste
is
a
bit
richer
than
bud
heavy
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
for
an
adjunct
lager
very
little
hoppiness
its
not
great
but
pretty
easy
to
drink
when
cold
i
cannot
stand
bud
light
in
fact
most
lite
beers
are
kinda
bad
having
said
that
i
find
this
beer
to
be
quite
nice
it
actually
has
pretty
decent
flavor
this
should
be
the
light
beer
choice
of
bud
drinkers
everywhere
not
its
super
selling
sister
bud
light
for
some
reason
that
i
cant
explain
i
actually
like
bud
select
i
like
it
much
more
than
bud
light
i
find
bud
select
to
have
a
better
taste
and
flavor
than
bud
light
its
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
one
that
i
will
drink
on
occasion
and
its
low
calorie
so
it
must
be
healthy
for
you
right
overall
not
a
bad
beer
goes
well
with
pizza
or
any
other
kind
of
food
a
good
everyday
drinker
sometimes
less
is
more
d
bad
for
folks
that
are
into
bud
light
and
other
popular
macrolagers
i
must
say
that
the
taste
isnt
far
off
so
i
suppose
its
a
good
lowcal
option
for
them
for
me
i
wont
drink
it
again
poured
into
my
pilsner
glass
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
billowy
white
head
on
top
decent
retention
left
some
sticky
lace
in
its
wake
scents
of
corn
grains
and
crackers
the
body
is
extremely
thin
and
wet
no
crisp
bite
at
all
even
though
i
can
see
plenty
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
flavors
of
buttered
corn
and
white
bread
very
weak
drinkability
is
high
as
its
like
drinking
corn
flavoredwater
but
whod
want
to
if
youre
gonna
get
a
macro
theres
better
than
this
out
there
not
a
great
beer
but
something
to
make
us
college
kids
feel
like
theyre
drinking
something
classic
not
something
ill
buy
and
this
one
was
given
to
me
by
a
friend
crisp
taste
and
good
drinkability
for
a
light
lager
keep
this
beer
from
being
a
total
flop
i
definitely
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
in
search
of
a
decent
beer
not
as
grainy
as
its
predecessors
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
not
as
metallic
either
but
this
is
still
an
unacceptable
brew
for
a
american
beer
expensive
for
the
category
d
a
bad
beer
99
calories
lousy
beer
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
little
head
that
disappears
almost
instantly
theres
really
not
too
much
going
on
with
this
one
and
thats
why
i
think
its
not
an
awful
beer
rice
and
grain
come
through
thats
all
i
dont
mind
drinking
these
during
the
game
theyre
incredibly
light
and
boring
drinkability
is
really
what
this
is
all
about
i
suppose
thats
the
difference
never
realized
this
qualified
as
a
light
lager
until
i
saw
it
here
but
it
looks
the
part
light
straw
reminiscent
if
a
miller
lite
or
the
ilk
about
an
34
inch
of
head
in
a
pint
glass
quickly
foams
down
to
just
a
bit
of
residue
on
top
smell
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
mexican
macro
lager
as
opposed
to
an
american
one
i
e
it
smells
like
fermented
grain
instead
of
just
grain
taste
is
weak
even
for
an
american
light
beer
it
does
have
a
bit
of
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
fades
quickly
the
initial
taste
and
lingering
aftertaste
is
only
slightly
different
from
seltzer
water
it
is
of
course
highly
drinkable
but
doesnt
score
perfect
marks
even
in
that
category
its
problematic
when
i
have
to
keep
looking
back
to
remember
what
im
drinking
you
like
bud
get
a
bud
light
and
save
some
money
you
like
beer
look
elsewhere
what
is
this
supposed
to
be
the
website
says
it
uses
bavarian
hops
really
thats
interesting
because
it
would
appear
they
are
nowhere
to
be
found
full
flavor
yeah
it
sure
is
full
of
diacetal
twang
although
you
sure
can
pound
em
hence
the
drinkability
score
although
you
want
to
stop
hurting
your
liver
for
the
flavor
equivalence
of
water
overall
i
try
to
cut
the
bmc
stuff
some
slack
it
serves
its
purpose
but
this
is
just
bad
there
are
plenty
of
other
better
marco
lagers
if
thats
what
youre
after
d
not
very
flavorful
but
it
goes
down
easily
and
is
not
too
filling
since
there
isnt
much
to
it
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
a
lackluster
style
overall
its
just
another
fizzy
yellow
beer
but
its
at
least
better
than
abs
other
light
beer
note
to
me
this
is
a
bud
light
mixed
with
regular
bud
but
hey
full
flavor
only
99
calories
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
maltiness
taste
is
uh
missing
for
the
most
part
crisp
and
flavorless
feels
light
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
good
great
for
drinking
games
overall
this
is
a
fairly
unimpressive
beer
so
after
this
whole
ordeal
what
have
i
learned
you
ask
i
have
learned
that
relatives
of
the
people
that
own
these
giant
breweries
are
just
as
ignorant
as
the
people
they
advertise
to
that
is
all
the
drinkability
is
poor
there
is
not
much
flavor
and
doesnt
satisfy
a
beer
craving
at
all
weak
from
the
24
fl
oz
can
marked

sampled
on
august

2009
the
pour
is
an
ultra
carbonated
pale
yellow
with
about
an
inch
thick
puffy
white
head
the
smell
is
of
corn
grain
and
a
glimmer
of
hops
and
not
quite
as
metallic
as
its
older
brother
budweiser
regular
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
the
taste
is
slightly
hopped
and
grassy
but
not
as
horrible
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
and
it
leaves
no
aftertaste
it
goes
down
pretty
quickly
like
water
deffinately
sessionable
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
of
grains
and
there
is
a
small
presence
of
hops
the
smell
is
better
than
other
light
beers
the
taste
has
slight
floral
hops
and
once
again
is
better
than
other
light
beers
in
this
class
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
beer
isnt
great
but
it
is
better
than
others
in
the
class
it
is
clearly
a
bud
product
it
tastes
like
every
other
bud
product
this
beer
is
nothing
special
my
friend
is
absolutely
crazy
about
this
beer
and
i
have
no
idea
why
he
likes
the
macro
lagers
but
i
mean
cmon
you
have
to
know
that
this
is
junk
i
wouldnt
even
drink
it
if
it
were
free
i
have
had
this
beer
in
the
past
before
i
was
really
into
craft
beer
and
thought
it
was
decent
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
decent
beer
it
has
good
flavor
for
a
light
lager
and
it
is
highly
drinkable
in
the
sense
you
could
easily
have
many
of
these
compared
to
something
like
a
goose
island
ipa
it
is
watery
i
know
its
easy
to
bash
the
big
boys
but
i
rated
this
beer
as
to
how
it
compares
to
others
in
its
category
and
by
that
standard
its
a
winner
will
i
seek
this
beer
out
no
i
was
at
a
festival
this
weekends
and
this
was
one
of
the
three
beers
they
had
the
lesser
of
the
three
evils
overall
its
not
a
very
good
beer
this
is
lighter
than
light
beer
if
dasani
made
beerflavored
water
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
not
really
any
worse
than
bud
light
or
bud
but
certainly
not
better
d
youd
survive
if
it
was
the
only
beer
at
a
party
d
definitely
not
worth
the
money
there
are
many
other
alternatives
for
a
lighter
beer
that
will
give
you
greater
flavor
and
more
bang
for
the
buck
at
the
very
least
it
goes
down
easy
but
lacks
character
or
intensity
bland

pale

and
paperslightly
metallic
thin

bodywith
a
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
this
was
drinkable
and
not
offensive
but
i
dont
believe
i
would
ever
buy
it
again
for
any
reason
as
expected
this
is
wonderfully
drinkable
as
it
has
hardly
more
flavor
than
a
glass
of
club
soda
in
fact
im
fairly
sure
that
i
drank
a
few
different
types
of
carbonated
mineral
water
in
germany
that
had
more
flavor
to
them
calling
this
beer
almost
seems
sacriligious
but
the
definition
of
what
beer
is
classes
this
accordingly
what
a
shame
final
thoughts
not
bad
if
youre
counting
calories
d
yet
again
comparing
this
only
to
other
macro
styles
its
got
decent
drinkability
goes
down
incredibly
easy
and
is
nice
and
light
in
the
belly
not
bad
at
all
for
99
calorie
brew
ive
sure
as
hell
had
worse
and
this
beer
is
not
bad
at
all
sure
its
not
a
mind
blowing
brew
but
it
is
a
macro
style
lager
its
not
meant
to
blow
your
mind
its
to
keep
you
refreshed
and
cool
you
off
it
does
just
that
and
brings
a
bit
of
flavor
to
the
equation
could
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
worse
thats
for
sure
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
no
head
smells
faintly
of
straw
and
mainly
corn
tastes
the
same
way
its
highly
carbonated
and
has
a
very
dry
finish
it
drinks
easy
so
if
you
wanted
something
inoffensive
and
to
slam
back
8
of
this
would
be
an
ok
choice
but
all
in
all
its
boring
once
of
the
worst
ive
had
thus
far
bud
select
has
a
limpid
strawgold
color
crystal
clear
with
little
head
retention
after
an
initial
burst
of
foam
the
nose
is
very
neutral
a
touch
grainy
but
otherwise
almost
nonexistent
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
with
no
detectable
bitterness
but
its
very
clean
and
not
excessively
grainy
bland
is
the
key
word
for
this
beer
cheers
well
it
is
not
as
good
as
other
light
beers
so
therefore
why
would
i
prefer
to
drink
this
over
other
at
least
passable
options
very
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quick
and
leaves
no
lace
smell
of
faint
toasted
grain
and
nothing
else
tastes
of
watered
down
cereal
grains
mildly
sweet
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
lame
avoid
there
are
a
million
better
beers
even
in
this
catagory
final
thoughts
what
is
there
to
really
say
we
know
what
it
is
a
low
carb
macro
brew
it
contains
minimal
calories
and
taste
that
being
said
it
goes
down
easy
enough
for
drinking
games
and
whatever
else
little
other
redeeming
qualites
used
to
be
1
but
now
sits
at
1
50
a
pint
always
a
winning
feature
in
my
book
drinkability
is
low
to
moderate
the
beer
would
be
sessionable
due
to
the
low
alcohol
but
the
flavor
profile
is
boring
at
best
and
what
little
is
happening
tastes
generic
and
poorly
crafted
thin
fizzy
and
watery
what
else
to
expect
good
for
beerpong
beer
games
and
those
trying
to
watch
their
weight
while
drinking

slightly

a

in

easy

drinkno
off
flavorsvery
clean
not
all
that
bad
could
see
the
drinkability
factor
just
not
enough
taste
for
mealthough
i
wouldnt
turn
a
cold
one
down
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
have
to
admit
i
still
purchase
this
when
my
inlaws
come
to
town
something
that
they
will
drink
and
i
can
stomach
out
of
a
24oz
can
this
beer
produced
a
ridiculously
huge
foamy
head
of
offwhite
bubbles
the
retention
was
decent
and
the
lacing
scattered
the
aroma
was
of
corn
mash
grains
and
some
light
hops
the
flavors
were
a
cleaned
up
version
of
regular
bud
but
still
quite
washed
out
pale
malt
bleached
hops
decent
balance
and
a
session
beer
for
those
who
fear
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
prickly
and
watery
the
carbonation
high
and
the
body
light
skip
it
d
just
terrible
atrocious
i
could
not
even
finish
a
whole
can
pours
a
piss
yellow
with
think
white
head
that
dissapates
rapidly
no
lacing
the
smell
is
pathetic
you
cant
smell
anything
the
taste
is
watery
with
slight
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
drinking
tonic
water
carbonated
and
tingly
it
is
drinkable
because
it
is
pretty
much
water
this
would
be
a
good
beer
if
you
were
sweating
one
out
at
a
ballpark
otherwise
pass
d
the
good
news
here
is
that
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
all
night
during
any
time
of
the
year
id
say
that
this
is
a
slightly
upgraded
version
of
mgd
64
this
is
not
trying
to
be
anything
other
than
what
it
is
and
i
think
it
does
it
much
better
than
the
other
light
beers
ive
tasted
not
bad
for
a
am
macro
session
beer
which
is
why
i
got
the
keg
for
my
guests
i
was
drinking
my
pale
ale
home
brew
abv
is
a
little
light
for
my
preference
to
buy
on
my
own
i
would
prefer
a
bottle
over
the
can
any
day
better
than
bud
light
and
most
light
beers
in
my
opinion
bud
select
ended
up
not
being
as
bad
as
i
expected
but
i
only
drink
this
when
there
is
nothing
else
or
its
really
hot
and
im
in
need
of
a
beer
that
is
not
too
heavy
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
bullfrog
ale
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
really
light
straw
with
a
big
white
head
that
melted
away
into
just
a
thin
layer
the
aroma
is
canned
corn
with
just
a
hint
of
grain
the
taste
is
almost
nonexistent
the
flavor
is
slightly
corny
but
mostly
just
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dry
but
mostly
just
watery
unless
you
dont
like
beer
definitely
stay
away
from
this
one
drinkability
as
is
the
case
with
so
many
of
these
macro
lager
theres
really
just
not
much
to
it
definitely
encouragement
to
win
at
beer
pong
there
really
isnt
much
to
talk
about
here
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
might
not
be
able
to
tell
bud
light
and
bud
select
apart
its
not
that
i
couldnt
taste
a
difference
its
just
they
are
equally
light
and
watery
and
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
pin
which
is
which
its
best
quality
is
once
again
mouthfeel
and
drinkablity
easy
to
drink
and
hey
its
cheap
too
good
college
beer
pours
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
no
headretentionlacing
smells
very
weak
but
you
can
still
pick
up
on
adjuncts
in
a
watery
lager
fits
the
style
well
enough
tastes
of
adjunct
in
lager
but
very
weak
body
overall
it
is
smooth
and
crisp
though
overall
wow
this
is
barely
beer
at
all
not
recommended
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
the
drinkability
other
than
that
nothing
if
your
looking
for
a
lite
beer
than
try
bud
light
or
any
of
the
other
lite
macroadjunct
lagers
out
there
just
dont
wast
your
money
on
this
folks
not
recommended
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
except
for
slamming
i
find
it
funny
that
budweiser
put
select
on
the
label
there
is
nothing
about
this
beer
that
is
very
special
unlike
some
others
on
this
site
im
not
above
drinking
an
anheuserbusch
product
from
time
to
time
im
also
not
below
trashing
their
products
but
come
on
if
youre
going
to
call
yourself
select
at
least
taste
like
something
other
than
bud
light
it
pours
clear
yellow
with
the
telltale
foamy
white
head
more
corn
and
sugar
in
the
nose
who
wants
a
lot
of
after

in
a

do
you
really
want
to
taste

do
you

this

this

were

better
than

wouldnt

no

noticable

for
a

i
dont
expect
to
smell
any
hops
either
no
offensive
flavors
at
all
too
much
carbonation
and
very
watery
the
upside
that
i
can

is
that
its
supposed
to

for
youlow

no

although
i
some
how
tend

get

when

i
would
probably
never
buy
this
beer
but
some
one
happened
to
leave
it
in

i
would
imagine
this
would
be

a

with

was

with

for

very

if

cheers
the

lack

is
still
better
than
the
horrid
taste
of
some
of
their
other
products
drinkability
nothing
select
about
this
brew
stick
with
regular
bud
if
youre
a
fan
of
that
beer
this
beer
made
me
angry
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
good
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
it
but
i
did
expect
it
to
be
at
least
different
i
didnt
care
how
or
what
exactly
was
going
to
be
different
but
just
something
that
distinguished
it
from
bud
or
bud
light
unfortunatley
i
had
no
idea
what
this
beer
was
trying
to
be
has
anyone
ever
drank
this
and
thought
to
his
or
herself
wow
this
is
a
new
idea
no
this
beer
is
all
about
marketing
they
put
the
same
fucking
beer
in
a
different
bottle
and
i
see
people
everyone
ordering
this
crap
this
beer
is
thin
has
no
smell
and
tastes
like
crap
i
could
barely
drink
it
this
being
select
and
the
pride
of
a
company
is
downright
comical
and
that
is
coming
from
someone
who
lives
near
st
louis
theres
just
so
little
smell
and
taste
its
hard
to
describe
nothing
i
guess
theres
a
bit
of
a
corn
taste
it
looks
as
pale
and
thin
as
it
smells
and
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
super
light
like
water
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
for
its
waterlike
qualities
but
the
utter
lack
of
desire
to
drink
this
nearly
flavorless
beverage
makes
me
bring
down
the
drinkability
score
to
a
3
bottom
line
ab
has
spent
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
developing
and
marketing
this
mess
why
avoid
it
at
least
bud
light
is
drinkable
i
think
they
may
need
to
try
and
select
a
few
other
things
and
give
it
another
go
i
would
like
to
taste
more
malt
and
def
more
hops
in
the
ending
and
smell
ok
so
this
beer
has
fooled
millions
into
thinking
they
are
drinking
good
beer
which
is
cool
if
lack
of
flavor
better
d
easy
drinking
could
drink
all
daynight
but
wouldnt
want
to
great
beer
for
collegebinge
drinking
looks
classier
than
budbud
light
but
is
worse
i
find
it
to
be
more
drinkable
than
regular
bud
the
lightest
color
i
have
ever
seen
more
of
a
white
then
a
pale
small
white
head
which
doesnt
last
clean
aroma
with
hints
of
pear
water
and
light
graincorn
disgusting
fermented
corn
water
in
the
flavor
without
a
note
to
be
noted
terrible
nasty
salud
i
really
cannot
tell
a
difference
between
this
and
bud
light
maybe
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
that
is
it
pours
light
golden
with
a
decent
head
that
does
not
last
very
long
taste
is
pretty
much
water
with
faint
hints
of
corn
and
alcohol
just
not
enough
character
to
satisfy
my
tastebuds
only
good
thing
is
the
born
on
date
i
wish
other
breweries
would
do
this
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
with
very
little
foam
nothing
exceptional
with
this
beer
after
awhile
all
buds
taste
the
same
this
is
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
or
while
sitting
around
watching
sporting
events
average
taste
average
average
average
eric
very
pale
yellow
very
clear
thin
white
foam
but
not
enough
to
call
it
head
very
little
to
smell
some
grain
typical
lager
smell
very
thin
and
light
bodied
another
crisp
clean
brew
with
hardly
any
flavor
oh
wait
tried
side
by
side
with
bud
light
and
it
does
have
more
taste
to
it
again
glad
i
didnt
pay
overall
bold
taste
finishes
clean
nope
better
than
a
bud
maybe
better
than
a
bud
light
hell
yes
better
than
most
other
decent
beers
out
there
fuhgetaboutit
not
recommended
i
mean
wheres
the
pride
how
cheap
do
you
get
verdict
dont
bother
you
might
as
well
put
the
beer
down
and
drink
a
pepsi
instead
the
pepsi
will
have
more
flavor
the
mouth
feel
was
the
highlight
of
the
beer
so
if
youre
not
so
much
into
the
taste
or
smell
this
just
may
be
a
winner
for
you
whats
going
on
here
this
is
as
nonbeerlike
as
you
can
get
yes
its
very
different
but
its
not
a
lime
soda
its
supposed
to
be
a
beer
as
a
former
ab
wholesaler
this
to
me
tastes
like
the
old
mich
dry
recipe
reborn
in
a
different
package
ab
swears
by
its
clean
fleeting
finish
and
thats
exactly
what
bud
select
gives
you
just
like
the
old
mich
dry
watery
pour
yellow
nothing
golden
about
this
thin
white
head
rice
and
malt
in
the
nose
hops
are
not
present
although
augie
iii
swears
theyre
in
there
carbonation
out
the
wazoo
which
leads
to
the
fleeting
finish
not
recommended
and
not
just
for
taste
but
the
horrific
hangover
it
gave
my
wife
in
comparison
to
the
standard
budweiser
this
is
lighter
and
less
flavorful
as
if
itd
simply
been
watered
down
on
the
other
hand
it
doesnt
have
the
sweet
maltiness
of
the
regular
version
and
therefore
appears
slightly
more
balanced
its
like
a
halfway
point
between
bud
and
bud
light
notes
tasted
very
similar
to
the
king
of
all
beers
budweiser
but
it
falls
short
of
its
father
beer
thats
not
a
compliment
to
either
seemed
to
fall
somewhere
between
budweisers
standard
lager
and
a
dry
beer
less
husky
than
the
standard
with
a
moderately
tart
finish
that
ended
on
a
distinctively
dry
astringent
note
the
overall
effect
take
a
quite
average
not
terribly
flavorful
beer
and
then
give
it
a
bit
of
pucker
at
the
finish
nothing
to
see
here
folks
move
along
budweiser
select
pours
a
urine
colored
yellow
with
minimal
head
from
a
twelve
ounce
can
aroma
is
fairly
light
consisting
of
adjunct
tastes
like
a
typical
light
american
macro
lager
in
other
words
it
tastes
of
adjuncts
and
not
much
else
this
is
a
very
light
beer
okay
for
what
it
is
lawnmower
beer
not
recommended
overall
better
than
i
expected
but
still
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
d
definitely
drinkable
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
if
i
was
left
with
bad
options
i
might
pick
this
up
again
i
dont
understand
how
this
beer
is
still
on
the
shelves
i
dont
think
frat
dudes
will
buy
it
because
it
isnt
an
established
slammin
beer
see
natty
ice
beast
etc
and
it
isnt
quite
in
the
lowcarb
realm
but
it
is
a
light
beer
and
it
most
certainly
is
not
an
attempt
at
a
craft
beer
i
dont
even
think
it
is
trying
to
go
against
the
heinekenbecks
import
crowd
as
i
recall
anheuser
world
select
was
supposed
to
tackle
that
niche
i
dont
know
who
ab
is
trying
to
market
with
this
brew
and
it
would
be
well
advised
to
anyone
who
wishes
to
conserve
their
taste
buds
that
they
stay
far
away
from
this
one
it
may
be
light
in
calories
and
flavor
but
what
flavor
it
does
have
is
near
putrid
unless
you
enjoyed
having
your
mouth
washed
out
with
soap
when
you
were
a
kid
wont
be
ordering
again
if
i
have
a
bud
it
will
be
a
regular
one
poured
into
my
trusty
goblet
sparkly
head
that
goes
away
in
30
seconds
lacing
present
but
not
to
sticky
not
much
smell
to
speak
of
golden
color
with
slight
yellow
hue
taste
is
really
bland
not
much
carbonation
very
faint
hop
taste
tastes
like
seltzer
water
difficult
to
believe
this
could
have
any
alcohol
in
it
i
think
ive
had
more
flavorful
near
beers
i
bet
this
would
be
a
good
one
though
playing
football
or
softball
when
its
ice
cold
out
of
a
cooler
in
90
degree
heat
and
90
percent
humidity
tried
one
of
these
i
honestly
think
there
is
more
taste
in
bud
light
poured
slightly
more
golden
than
bud
light
small
head
smells
of
something
taste
is
really
just
nothing
honestly
it
is
chuggable
though
more
so
than
bud
light
not
hard
to
get
down
or
anything
i
just
wouldnt
buy
it
skunky
aroma
with
a
touch
of

pale

with
a
very

frothy
white
head
slightly

in

fore
with
some
corn
and
cereal
corn
flakes
is
about
right
in
the
finish
its
a
lot
better
than
budweiser
but
it
has
very

drinkability
typical

expect
it

at
best
that
s
what
this
beer
is
to
me
it
may
be
a
good
choice
with
many
types
of
food
since
it
is
so
light
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
decent
head
that
dissipates
and
leaves
a
spotty
lacing
smell
is
of
cream
corn
maybe
yeast
alcohol
it
just
doesnt
smell
the
least
bit
enticing
taste
is
better
than
smell
but
that
isnt
saying
much
very
bland
flavor
it
has
a
corn
flavor
but
its
very
watery
mouthfeel
is
very
light
i
would
rate
it
higher
but
the
carbonation
is
way
too
high
honestly
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
its
not
necessarily
bad
but
it
just
isnt
that
good
either
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
creamy
layer
pretty
quickly
smells
very
slightly
of
yeast
and
nothing
else
tastes
like
it
smells
like
nothing
slight
bitterness
without
any
hop
flavor
slight
sweetness
without
any
malt
flavor
its
like
ab
waved
some
malt
over
the
kettle
and
showed
it
a
picture
of
some
hops
then
just
used
rice
and
hop
oil
to
make
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
really
watery
with
a
slight
tingling
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
not
good
at
all
its
drinkable
but
so
is
water
and
water
is
cheaper
just
water
down
vodka
its
the
same
experience
i
figured
the
only
way
i
could
pay
the
least
amount
to
actually
try
this
was
to
have
it
at
a
bar
cause
after
having
it
there
is
no
way
id
ever
want
another
again
just
boring
no
smell
none
in
fact
the
only
reason
it
didnt
get
a
1
is
because
it
didnt
smell
just
plain
bad
as
far
as
taste
goes
it
was
basically
a
slightly
more
flavorful
bud
but
not
by
much
as
far
as
i
remember
if
youre
going
to
buy
a
bud
product
like
this
you
may
as
well
go
for
bud
light
or
natural
light
which
will
probably
be
much
cheaper
with
about
the
same
characteristics
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
with
a
mild
skunky
finish
this
stuff
is
awful
i
bought
this
a
couple
of
months
ago
in
the
summer
cause
if
worse
comes
to
worse
i
can
deal
with
budweiser
regular
but
this
is
way
too
thin
missing
everything
except
water
no
hop
presence
whatsoever
no
malt
presence
either
i
couldnt
figure
out
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
except
sell
at
bars
to
young
drinkers
who
need
to
drink
40
beers
to
get
a
buzz
off
this
stuff
if
you
are
going
anhbusch
stick
with
michelob
or
bud
if
you
have
to
born
on
date
nov
23
2005
the
beer
poured
a
a
pale
straw
with
a
white
fizzy
bubbled
head
that
rose
to
just
over
a
finger
and
dissipated
quickly
the
carbonation
was
very
visible
with
little
bubbles
rapidly
traveling
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
nearly
non
existent
but
after
nearly
touching
my
nose
to
the
liquid
i
picked
up
some
graininess
the
taste
was
quick
and
insanely
clean
some
residual
graininess
lingers
on
the
tongue
with
the
very
dry
sensation
to
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
and
not
the
best
of
what
is
often
thought
to
be
a
very
flawed
style
i
would
love
to
see
a
dry
hoppier
finish
like
a
true
european
pils
this
beer
would
be
quite
adqueate
with
that
one
addition
but
instead
it
remains
quick
and
bland
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
beer
but
not
in
the
way
one
would
want
the
manner
in
which
water
is
drinkable
budweiser
select
whose
marketing
program
manifests
a
step
forward
for
ab
in
some
way
still
needs
something
more
this
beer
pours
with
a
white
frothy
head
with
a
golden
yellow
color
the
head
holds
moderately
well
and
laces
decently
the
smell
is
quite
harsh
not
very
apealing
it
smells
of
rice
and
corn
this
is
probably
a
worse
smell
than
skunk
there
is
hardly
any
taste
at
all
the
taste
is
harsh
like
the
smell
it
is
almost
chemical
there
are
worse
beers
out
there
though
this
beer
is
overcarbonated
watery
and
not
smooth
at
all
this
should
only
be
used
for
beer
pong
finishes
almost
imperceptibly
but
oily
and
sour
with
a
shortlived
aftertaste
i
would
drink
soda
or
even
a
glass
of
water
before
having
this
one
again
theres
just
no
point
im
not
into
drinking
alcohol
just
for
the
sake
of
drinking
alcohol
so
i
really
would
skip
the
beer
if
there
wasnt
anything
better
than
this
available
the
clears
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
limpid
light
gold
color
with
a
portly
bright
white
frothy
head
the
lace
a
fine
coating
upon
the
glass
archetypal
lager
nose
sweet
malt
and
little
else
start
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
light
but
present
grain
profile
the
top
light
finish
is
strikingly
acidic
the
hops
light
but
there
at
least
very
dry
aftertaste
in
all
fairness
and
it
is
what
it
is
an
everyday
lager
i
think
this
is
micheloeb
ultra
in
different
packaging
if
im
out
at
the
bar
that
only
has
macros
i
might
drink
this
otherwise
ill
pass
is
select
the
new
ice
pale
yellow
and
bubbly
with
a
thin
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
faint
musty
hops
aroma
or
maybe
i
imagined
it
seltzerwater
character
with
no
real
flavor
present
dont
they
use
the
word
bold
somewhere
in
the
advertising
right
the
finish
is
equally
tasteless
this
beer
is
doa
this
beer
is
nothing
special
but
it
most
certainly
is
crisp
refined
and
goes
down
easy
pours
just
like
everybody
else
says
and
yada
yada
with
the
smell
and
taste
we
all
know
what
bud
tastes
like
this
is
just
about
inbetween
bud
heavy
and
bud
light
it
is
just
right
with
the
flavor
bud
light
is
like
drinking
water
that
somebody
poured
a
little
beer
into
bud
heavy
is
a
thicker
beer
that
fills
you
up
quicker
this
is
probably
what
bud
heavy
should
be
nice
and
refreshing
but
nothing
that
will
blow
your
socks
off
it
has
easily
become
my
beer
of
choice
when
i
want
to
get
faded
for
the
weekend
as
it
goes
down
smooth
beer
after
beer
after
beer
if
i
just
wanted
to
lay
back
and
drink
a
beer
it
would
most
certainly
be
overlooked
but
take
it
for
what
it
is
a
beer
to
be
consumed
by
the
mass
market
in
mass
quantities
cant
go
wrong
here
best
used
for
beer
pong
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
for
a
light
lager
for
the
ba
score
if
i
graded
it
according
to
style
id
call
it
at
least
a
4
0
i
think
id
end
up
giving
it
a
2
5
or
so
but
for
the
style
its
pretty
good
d
i
suppose
you
could
put
down
quite
a
few
because
of
the
low
alcohol
and
little
taste
a
god
beer
for
a
frat
party
thats
about
it
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
surprise
here
surprised
because
i
actually
didnt
despise
this
the
color
of
this
was
like
golden
straw
fizzy
and
sporadic
carbonation
with
a
fizzy
head
the
aroma
has
some
soft
lemony
graininess
with
just
a
touch
of
cooked
cabbage
hoppiness
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
finishes
with
a
subtle
and
pleasant
graininess
overall
i
believe
this
is
a
much
smoother
than
regular
bud
cleaner
and
less
harsh
i
really
have
not
much
negative
to
say
about
it
clean
and
simple
and
maybe
what
regular
bud
should
really
be
allright
this
is
bad
but
really
i
dont
see
it
that
much
worse
than
regular
bud
looks
similar
to
but
and
there
is
no
real
smell
besides
the
macro
chemical
norm
the
taste
is
similar
to
bud
also
but
do
i
maybe
detect
some
fruityness
not
enough
to
save
it
it
still
sucks
watery
mouthfeel
drinkablity
is
allright
but
i
dont
know
why
you
would
want
to
so
it
is
irrelevant
ok
as
an
avid
bud
fan
i
felt
i
owed
it
to
the
people
whoever
they
are
to
review
this
one
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
big
head
that
rapidly
receedes
other
then
that
it
looks
totally
flat
no
bubbles
rising
or
anything
aromawhat
aroma
nowhere
to
be
found
flavor
is
best
described
as
if
rainman
was
describing
itwetvery
wet
other
then
thatnothing
fair
mouthfeelthin
but
theres
something
there
overallforget
it
im
a
big
believer
in
a
place
and
time
for
everything
but
this
is
sad
has
to
be
the
worst
lite
beer
i
have
ever
tried
or
been
offered
pours
clear
yellow
with
two
finger
head
low
head
retention
high
lacing
very
faint
adjunct
smell
grain
and
rice
most
likely
what
differentiates
this
from
regular
budweiser
is
its
lack
of
aftertaste
which
is
a
good
thing
considering
the
poor
flavor
it
does
however
live
up
to
the
crisp
with
a
clean
finish
claim
while
sacrificing
any
note
of
real
beer
flavor
drinkability
the
good
news
at
least
it
got
lower
contents
in
carbs
and
calories
also
the
label
is
not
that
bad
otherwise
the
name
tells
you
all
and
you
knows
what
to
do
if
what
to
drink
higher
quality
beer
avoid
it
in
my
quest
for
good
beer
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
worst
got
a
24
pack
for
the
family
along
with
some
oberon
full
circle
and
reds
rye
i
decided
to
drink
a
leftover
and
give
this
beer
a
chance
pours
a
very
light
watery
pale
golden
color
nice
head
forms
and
decent
retention
lots
of
bubbles
along
the
side
of
the
glass
and
rising
to
the
top
smell
is
mildly
grainy
in
an
artificial
adjunct
sort
of
way
taste
is
almost
nothing
this
beer
is
so
dry
and
watery
that
i
can
discern
almost
no
flavor
slightly
sweet
grain
at
the
initial
sip
but
it
goes
away
right
away
not
even
refreshing
this
beer
is
worthless
on
the
bright
side
ive
had
worse
yea
really
looks
poorly
yellow
and
clear
with
high
carbonation
the
same
head
you
get
from
a
diet
sprite
and
no
lacing
at
all
smells
like
spoiled
water
is
that
even
possible
grainy
vegetive
sour
and
almost
no
sweetness
tastes
more
grainy
cornlike
among
other
cerial
grains
sharp
and
metalic
body
is
watery
and
over
carbonated
finishes
crisp
and
a
bit
scrubbed
aftertaste
is
non
existant
basically
a
waste
of
grains
hops
water
and
yeast
i
cannot
believe
my
buddy
even
bought
this
stuff
i
mean
he
is
a
little
over
weight
but
not
that
overweight
that
he
needed
to
make
us
suffer
through
this
crap
it
poured
a
pale
yellowish
color
with
nice
clarity
it
smelled
of
nothing
maybe
a
little
bit
of
grain
it
is
overly
dry
causing
a
cottonmouth
feel
besides
being
dry
it
has
this
crispy
bite
to
it
that
is
most
umpleasant
gross
gross
gross
regardless
if
this
is
from
anheuserbusch
or
not
its
below
average
thats
all
no
real
lacing
lots
of
carbonations
ver
pale
straw
colored
slight
cornrice
taste
but
nearly
as
overwhelmingly
bad
as
cheap
macros
milwaukees
best
etc
easy
enough
to
drink
not
horrible
but
would
not
have
gotten
this
if
a
it
wasnt
1
50
and
b
it
wasnt
a
requirement
to
finish
a
beer
club
at
the
local
pub
i
really
cant
say
enough
bad
things
about
this
select
beer
managed
to
down
half
the
bottle
for
educational
purposes
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
white
puffy
head
smell
is
not
much
to
talk
about
maybe
a
slight
scent
of
grain
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
no
trace
of
hops
or
malt
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
just
as
a
glass
of
water
might
be
i
tried
this
after
a
regular
budweiser
and
had
trouble
telling
the
difference
color
is
that
of
extremely
diluted
urine
barely
any
color
and
clear
only
a
barely
noted
fizzy
white
head
is
seen
aromas
again
are
brealy
noted
is
that
some
cornyhusky
scent
i
detect
flavor
is
like
fizzy
water
it
amazes
me
that
people
actually
find
this
to
be
a
beer
they
want
to
drink
the
fizz
overpowers
anything
in
the
way
of
flavor
some
grainlike
flavor
husky
finishes
without
a
trace
of
any
aftertaste
whatsoever
its
like
it
evaporates
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
laughable
not
drinkable
to
say
the
least
drinkability
had
to
mow
a
decent
size
lawn
this
morning
and
figured
with
all
this
talk
about
lawnmower
beers
i
would
give
this
one
a
try
just
to
quench
my
thirst
lord
knows
you
cant
get
prima
pils
in
montana
ended
up
pouring
out
about
a
13
of
it
and
just
having
water
instead
so
when
you
have
to
resort
to
water
sulfer
flavored
water
instead
of
any
kind
of
beer
enough
said
avoid
did
i
mention
that
i
actually
like
budweiser
22
oz
born
on
4605
figured
i
was
gonna
try
it
one
time
or
another
served
chilled
in
a
nonic
the
head
is
the
only
thing
that
looks
ok
its
2
fingers
and
has
decent
pits
as
is
recedes
leaving
more
lacing
than
i
usually
see
from
ab
beers
corn
metal
and
other
adjunct
scents
in
the
nose
on
the
palate
carbonation
thats
it
theyve
finally
figured
a
way
to
filter
all
the
flavor
out
of
their
beer
it
wasnt
until
near
the
end
of
the
bomber
that
hints
of
corn
appeared
mouthfeel
is
tingly
and
very
light
im
staying
away
from
this
one
in
the
future
these
are
the
type
of
beers
that
confuse
me
theyre
almost
fitness
drinks
and
they
drink
as
easy
as
tap
water
its
as
close
to
the
original
budweiser
as
any
light
or
ultralight
ive
had
it
seems
to
be
server
nearfreezing
as
to
numb
your
tongue
and
senses
im
surprised
its
4
3
because
i
was
pretty
sure
it
was
no
more
than
3
4
ill
be
darned
if
theyre
willing
to
waste
a
glass
on
it
bottle
only
its
a
good
beer
to
have
with
nachos
jalepenos
but
thats
about
it
pours
piss
yellow
with
a
thin
white
cap
grainy
aroma
watery
taste
crisp
and
light
sharp
mouthfeel
hard
to
believe
how
flavourless
beer
can
get
only
drank
it
because
it
was
free
and
was
eating
crappy
burgers
ive
had
better
light
beers
with
more
flavour
profile
this
one
truly
sucks
drinkable
if
you
want
something
fast
to
get
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
but
many
many
better
options
this
is
too
pricey
to
be
a
super
cheap
swill
but
has
less
flavor
a
good
and
a
bad
thing
objectiveness
right
as
much
as
i
can
i
like
bud
and
bud
light
but
this
is
terrible
very
watered
down
quite
frankly
this
beer
does
not
have
enough
of
anything
that
would
remotely
give
off
any
indelible
characteristic
unfortunaley
i
purchased
a
six
pack
and
have
lost
out
on
a
couple
of
bucks
i
decided
to
try
this
the
other
day
just
for
the
sake
of
knowing
what
ab
considers
select
i
found
myself
asking
what
is
the
big
deal
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
and
the
color
really
light
like
your
urine
after
a
few
regular
buds
there
was
a
hint
of
the
hops
but
the
carbonation
overwhelmes
them
my
first
and
last
drinkability
this
is
a
standard
american
macro
light
lager
that
has
little
to
offer
a
serious
beerdrinker
crisp
and
refreshing
with
no
offnotes
but
very
bland
and
watery
a
decent
fizzy
light
yellow
beer
that
is
brewed
for
the
masses
who
are
not
seeking
any
nuances
or
complexity
easy
to
quaff
but
so
is
soda
water
purchased
at
a
gas
station
on
a
lark
in
a
24
oz
can
the
color
is
pale
yellow
head
is
just
a
tiny
layer
of
foam
the
aroma
is
a
typical
macro
beer
light
sweetness
nothing
special
going
on
with
the
taste
either
just
light
malts
and
adjunct
sweetness
with
a
very
clean
finish
i
guess
drinkability
is
okay
this
doesnt
have
any
offtastes
and
is
refreshing
enough
i
wonder
with
bud
light
already
on
the
market
was
there
really
any
reason
to
release
bud
select
drinkability
id
rather
go
for
a
real
club
soda
even
if
i
were
really
pining
for
a
beer
this
wouldnt
do
it
but
again
not
totally
awful
almost
no
aroma
whatsoever
only
hints
of
cooked
grain
and
hops
taste
is
even
lighter
very
subtle
hints
of
bitterness
that
quickly
are
overtaken
by
equally
subtle
sweetness
from
cooked
veggies
seltzer
like
quality
is
reminiscent
of
well
alkaseltzer
with
almost
no
mouth
feel
and
cheweyness
youd
expect
from
a
beer
one
thing
it
does
have
in
its
favor
is
that
it
is
better
than
bud
light
so
if
you
have
a
choice
between
this
beer
and
bud
light
grab
this
one
for
things
this
light
i
vastly
prefer
the
japanese
superdrys
but
in
the
american
lager
category
id
have
to
say
both
coors
and
miller
both
of
which
have
at
least
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
are
better
overall
just
another
macro
brew
it
is
easy
enough
to
drink
while
painting
the
garage
im
sure
and
inoffensive
when
theres
nothing
better
but
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
stuff
id
pick
regular
bud
over
this
well
if
only
given
two
choices
i
would
get
sick
of
this
in
no
time
i
have
to
say
that
the
anheiser
world
select
that
was
test
marketed
before
they
changed
over
to
this
stuff
was
much
better
extremely
mediocre
drinkability
sure
i
could
drink
this
stuff
but
i
could
get
about
the
same
amount
of
satisfaction
out
of
a
sprite
this
beer
rivals
the
lowcarb
brews
for
least
amount
of
character
not
worth
your
time
unless
you
dont
like
to
taste
your
beer
then
its
perfect
for
you
at
first
i
thought
popping
this
was
going
to
be
something
special
that
bud
did
right
like
michelob
as
i
was
sitting
down
to
watch
tv
after
work
with
a
platter
of
sushi
it
looked
a
little
light
and
i
liked
the
head
it
produced
in
my
50cl
glass
but
other
wise
it
was
nothing
special
the
first
taste
revealed
elements
of
regular
bud
to
bud
light
and
it
finished
like
busch
draft
i
thought
it
was
soso
with
the
sushi
as
bud
usually
goes
well
with
sushi
and
sashimi
for
me
strangely
it
tasted
as
if
bud
was
designing
something
to
be
a
thirst
quencher
for
a
dance
floor
and
a
shallow
locarb
wanna
be
pours
a
onefinger
white
froth
from
the
bottle
being
straight
up
this
fades
quickly
and
there
is
no
lace
clear
very
pale
amber
color
nose
is
not
there
for
me
at
least
it
is
not
skunky
like
so
many
from
the
macros
light
carbonation
and
very
light
bodied
starts
with
a
slight
sweetness
no
detectable
hops
watery
finish
i
would
rather
drink
water
than
spend
money
on
this
beer
1
25
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
lace
for
a
head
smells
like
cooked
grains
and
grass
i
little
bit
of
sulfer
too
every
thin
body
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
sizzles
on
the
tounge
a
bit
taste
slighty
sweet
and
grainy
a
small
hop
presence
finishes
like
a
bottle
of
water
not
much
going
on
with
this
beer
just
a
marketing
scam
by
budweiser
to
me
there
is
no
point
to
this
beer
just
cheap
with
no
flavor
i
fail
to
see
what
is
select
about
bedweiser
select
this
beer
is
quite
tasteless
it
does
have
a
bit
more
taste
than
bud
light
or
michelob
ultra
but
it
isnt
much
more
noticeable
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
if
you
want
water
but
for
taste
stay
far
away
from
this
this
beer
was
seriously
unimpressive
thick
bone
white
head
on
top
of
what
looked
like
regular
budweiser
with
extra
yellow
no
5
smelled
like
sweat
socks
stronger
malt
flavor
than
the
regular
bud
heavy
corn
sugar
sweetness
and
very
mild
practically
nonexistent
hop
flavor
good
lacing
down
the
glass
and
no
aftertaste
at
all
the
vitamin
water
of
american
beer
except
without
the
vitamins
if
you
want
taste
get
it
somewhere
else
notes
more
drinkable
than
a
bud
light
or
regular
budweiser
i
was
not
let
down
in
summation
it
is
just
bud
light
without
the
lingering
after
taste
there
you
have
it
a
close
contest
between
two
lightweights
that
didnt
settle
much
of
anything
bud
select
looks
better
the
slightly
paler
color
is
more
than
offset
by
the
superior
head
and
feels
a
little
better
in
the
mouth
since
it
maintains
its
carbonation
longer
milwaukees
best
light
smells
and
tastes
a
little
better
pretty
much
a
draw
if
you
ask
me
as
bad
a
brew
as
ive
had
from
one
of
the
major
breweries
i
thought
this
would
be
added
flavor
being
it
was
select
it
is
not
it
has
little
flavor
and
what
flavor
it
does
have
is
nasty
it
literally
tastes
like
i
took
a
glass
of
water
dropped
an
ounce
of
bud
light
into
and
mixed
it
up
this
has
no
redeeming
qualities
id
take
a
host
of
light
beer
over
this
that
have
more
flavor
the
worst
purchase
i
have
made
in
many
years
stick
to
regular
bud
if
you
like
ab
macros
hey
its
not
far
off
for
its
style
and
its
definitely
a
step
up
from
michelob
ultra
i
really
like
the
bottle
too
its
got
a
distinguished
understated
elegence
if
neither
of
those
good
points
appel
to
you
probably
best
to
avoid
this
about
the
best
thing
that
can
be
said
about
this
beer
is
that
its
relatively
atkins
friendly
being
a
lowcarb
beer
it
definitely
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
having
an
extremely
bland
flavor
and
lack
of
character
while
making
a
lowcarb
beer
may
be
an
admirable
goal
it
seems
to
me
that
real
beer
lovers
would
prefer
one
with
more
carbs
albeit
flavor
and
character
standard
clear
gold
color
small
fizzy
head
smell
is
not
very
strong
just
when
i
think
i
smell
some
maltiness
it
disappears
taste
is
pretty
much
like
any
other
light
macro
not
interesting
no
hops
present
and
relatively
malt
free
a
little
grain
is
all
that
is
present
fizzy
mouthfeel
whats
the
point
you
can
get
a
6
packs
of
hundreds
of
different
craft
brews
and
regionals
for
what
this
crap
costs
stay
away
thanks
to
clvand0
for
sharing
this
with
me
as
i
would
not
have
had
it
on
my
own
poured
into
my
pbr
chalice
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
golden
yellow
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
more
than
i
would
expect
over
top
of
the
liquid
the
nose
is
typical
with
a
slightly
corn
sweet
grainey
character
and
no
hop
at
all
the
flavor
is
slightly
grainey
and
just
touched
with
some
corn
sweetness
not
as
harsh
as
others
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
very
clean
finish
as
promised
the
feel
is
light
with
a
very
active
carbonation
overall
its
ok
not
a
bad
beer
to
sit
down
with
after
some
hard
yard
work
when
you
want
something
to
slam
hey
its
not
some
off
da
hook
beer
but
its
good
and
i
like
to
drink
it
very
light
heard
its
the
low
carb
bud
beer
out
of
the
low
carb
beers
its
one
of
the
better
ones
has
a
maltier
and
more
tasteful
taste
than
bud
light
which
is
just
water
not
much
on
aftertaste
but
still
has
a
little
malthop
tinge
in
the
end
vey
easy
on
the
palate
so
its
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
i
prefer
it
over
most
light
beers
actually
i
know
buds
a
big
nasty
corpo
but
they
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
24
oz
can
a
weak
attempt
at
cloning
miller
lite
bud
light
took
a
beating
in
the
lowcarb
advertising
wars
from
miller
due
to
its
relatively
high
carbohydrate
content
now
ab
has
made
a
brew
that
is
almost
identical
to
miller
lite
99
calories
and
3
1g
carbs
miller
comes
in
at
96
calories
and
3
0g
carbs
this
beer
pours
to
a
nice
white
head
with
tiny
bubbles
color
is
very
pale
like
all
the
others
of
its
ilk
aroma
is
very
weak
much
like
lite
flavor
is
almost
nonexistent
very
litelike
no
aftertaste
at
all
how
they
got
the
enhanced
mouthfeel
is
beyond
me
bland
as
hell
and
hellbent
on
taking
back
market
share
that
bud
light
lost
to
miller
in
this
category
nice
idea
from
budweiser
i
always
love
it
when
new
things
to
try
come
out
im
not
sure
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
their
version
of
a
lowcarb
beer
or
what
but
if
it
is
i
think
they
did
an
excellent
job
this
beer
tastes
far
better
than
michelob
ultra
or
aspen
edge
mouthfeel
gets
too
flat
sometimes
aside
from
that
theres
not
much
of
anything
special
to
speak
of
it
actually
reminds
more
of
miller
lite
than
it
does
a
budweiser
product
i
think
id
call
it
miller
in
a
taste
test
not
bad
though
a
nice
change
of
pace
you
can
only
expect
so
much
from
your
run
of
the
mill
domestic
brew
with
that
in
mind
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
what
the
hell
are
they
trying
to
make
the
most
bland
beer
one
step
away
from
mineral
water
but
not
as
tasty
clear
gold
color
fluffy
white
head
head
rapidly
fades
to
nothing
i
noticed
a
small
periling
going
on
in
the
glass
aroma
of
fresh
cut
hay
musty
wet
at
that
flavor
can
be
summed
up
with
lack
of
nothing
was
there
in
the
flavor
department
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
bland
drinkability
why
i
have
to
admit
the
very
first
time
i
had
budweiser
select
i
actually
loved
it
but
then
after
a
few
weeks
of
drinking
it
on
a
regular
basis
i
grew
tired
of
it
very
quickly
one
good
thing
is
that
there
is
very
little
aftertaste
but
after
a
while
it
tastes
so
ridiculously
watered
down
id
obviously
recommend
this
to
anybody
who
is
watching
their
carbs
or
maybe
if
you
are
participating
in
some
drinking
game
but
if
you
want
to
sit
around
the
house
and
have
a
nice
cold
one
this
definitely
is
not
what
you
are
looking
for
edit
upon
reading
the
reviews
of
others
after
posting
i
now
realize
this
is
a
lowcarb
beer
damn
ab
for
not
expressly
saying
that
i
would
not
have
wasted
my
money
i
feel
soiled
atkins
dieters
should
be
drowned
in
this
swill
drinkable
yes
for
there
is
nothing
here
to
offend
again
with
the
roll
out
this
beer
had
i
was
expecting
more
this
is
as
bad
as
beer
can
get
it
truly
is
a
low
point
in
the
history
of
beer
in
part
because
select
is
not
labeled
a
light
beer
or
low
carbohydrate
it
is
like
ab
is
trying
to
fool
the
consumer
yet
again
dont
believe
the
hype
it
is
a
flavorless
beer
it
is
for
the
masses
that
dont
like
beer
but
want
to
get
drunk
or
fit
in
select
is
as
bad
as
michelob
ultra
i
purchased
a
22ounce
bottle
for
1
50
in
omaha
and
split
it
with
bluemooner
she
gave
up
after
a
couple
sips
i
finished
my
glass
for
the
sake
of
this
review
but
the
rest
of
the
bottle
went
down
the
drain
i
will
never
purchase
or
drink
this
beer
again
i
recommend
you
avoid
this
unfunny
joke
sampled
this
one
along
with
a
bud
dry

thought
they
may
be
the
same
but
no
theyre
close
cousins
but
a
little
different
the
select
is
clear
amber
yellow
slightly
darker
than
the
dry
little
more
hoppy
in
the
finish
over
dry
no
aftertaste
say
the
marketing
geniuses

why
would
that
be
a
good
thing
awfully
plain
and
generally
tasteless
but
still
not
an
unpleasant
beer
was
drinkable
outside
for
an
afternoon
session
yeah
better
ones
are
out
there
awaiting
if
you
want
to
drink
beer
without
tasting
anything
make
no
mistake
this
is
the
beer
for
you
overallive
never
seen
anything
like
this
even
michelob
ultra
left
me
with
something
to
taste
and
didnt
just
dissapear
i
know
thats
what
they
were
going
for
but
damn
as
for
the
beer
its
nuthing
special
dont
go
looking
for
it
unless
you
like
light
beer
for
whatever
reason
sadly
ab
is
gonna
make
billions
off
this
stuff
from
previously
noted
frat
boys
and
college
girls
who
cant
appreciate
the
taste
of
real
beer
anyway
somebody
brought
one
of
these
over
to
my
house
so
i
had
to
try
it
because
i
was
curious
but
not
curious
to
buy
one
for
myself
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
very
little
head
and
very
light
carbonation
i
smelled
it
and
thought
maybe
my
glass
is
empty
because
i
dont
smell
anything
look
down
and
there
is
beer
in
my
glass
so
very
little
or
no
aroma
here
about
the
flavor
imagine
you
had
a
standard
bud
light
then
cut
it
with
an
equal
amount
of
water
literally
this
beer
has
almost
no
flavor
at
all
slight
hint
of
the
standard
bud
light
but
barely
noticeable
not
even
a
beer
hell
ill
just
have
some
water
instead
tastes
the
same
well
i
saw
the
super
bowl
commericial
promising
a
new
beer
in
practice
i
havent
had
budweiser
or
bud
light
in
quite
some
time
but
from
what
i
remember
this
tastes
exactly
the
same
as
any
other
macro
so
i
have
to
ask
whats
the
point
of
packaging
this
in
a
bomber
when
its
nothing
but
the
same
old
same
old
the
only
thing
nice
about
this
is
that
the
22
oz
was
only
1
19
so
no
big
loss
to
give
it
a
try
but
ill
never
bother
with
this
again
no
waywould
i
buy
more
of
this
usual
low
carb
crap
doesnt
ab
know
the
low
carb
frenzy
is
almost
over
i
dont
see
the
point
in
this
beer
they
alreadyhave
the
abysmal
mich
ultra
drank
everywere
by
obese
idiots
with
their
plate
of
grease
bottom
line
wheres
the
beer
12
ouncer
sampled
born
on
dating
pours
very
light
straw
nose
is
non
existant
taste
is
ultra
thin
body
is
watery
this
is
worthless
swill
more
wasting
of
decent
water
by
ab
the
best
feature
of
this
product
is
the
born
on
dating
concept
i
wish
many
other
brewery
case
us
beer
drinkers
that
kind
of
usefull
info
pass
this
stuff
by
support
micro
brewers
well
it
is
a
light
lager
it
looks
well
clear
as
a
light
lager
should
reasonably
good
head
retention
on
this
as
well
kind
of
a
fluffy
head
aroma
is
slightly
metallic
to
me
flavor
is
bland
yet
crisp
as
advertised
mouthfeel
is
as
stated
no
front
mid
or
aftertaste
well
carbonated
not
much
going
on
in
this
beer
yet
there
isnt
anything
offensive
a
thirst
quencher
but
thats
about
it
perhaps
bud
ultra
light
is
a
more
suitable
name
poured
out
to
a
light
yellow
golden
color
with
a
short
lived
white
lacy
head
medium
light
carbonation
not
much
of
a
nose
but
hints
of
stewed
veggies
and
earthy
notes
were
observed
light
airy
taste
of
corn
and
hops
could
be
a
whole
lot
stronger
but
considering
this
is
low
carb
its
not
bad
less
flavor
than
miller
light
but
a
nice
change
and
a
bit
less
abrasive
mouthfeel
worth
a
try
slàinte
sort
of
this
poured
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
there
honestly
was
not
much
to
the
smell
only
a
few
traces
of
grain
the
taste
was
very
weak
with
only
hints
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
near
the
end
what
little
taste
there
was
vanished
quickly
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
like
carbonated
water
as
for
drinkability
its
certainly
drinkable
but
you
wont
want
to
drink
more
than
one
im
not
at
all
impressed
with
this
one
as
usual
when
it
comes
to
ab
products
ive
had
dry
italian
wines
that
made
your
tongue
feel
like
a
dry
sponge
but
this
is
worse
worse
to
the
point
of
being
a
punchline
seriously
drinkability

i
enjoy
a
good
light
lager
but
this
just
didnt
cut
it
it
wasnt
refreshing
it
had
a
long
sweet
finish
and
the
sugars
were
on
par
if
not
bigger
than
the
malts
it
tastes
a
lot
like
michelob
a
little
hoppier
than
regular
bud
but
with
no
nose
whatsoever
the
only
notable
feature
of
this
beer
is
the
complete
absense
of
a
bouquet
hence
asinine
no
aftertaste
marketing
the
flavor
stops
with
almost
surgecal
precision
after
the
beer
is
gone
it
freaked
me
out
on
the
brightside
this
beer
is
about
as
drinkable
as
they
come
if
i
got
suckered
into
playing
drinking
games
etc
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
go
clear
light
gold
color
darker
by
a
shade
than
budweiser
head
is
very
foamy
and
white
rises
high
and
sinks
lke
a
stone
some
limited
commalike
lace
aroma
is
a
little
pearlike
with
a
standard
malt
sweetness
sharp
not
seemingly
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
medium
and
toned
down
compared
to
some
macros
flavor
echos
the
pear
impression
a
little
too
sharp
and
metallic
with
a
bare
sense
of
dry
hops
the
brew
takes
a
powder
mid
mouth
fades
out
of
any
perspective
but
unlike
some
lightlow
carbs
doesnt
finish
quite
as
watery
not
good
not
offensive
mildly
drinkable
with
an
ok
mouthfeel
why
this
beer
was
probably
created
to
chip
away
at
the
macrolager
market
i
am
sure
they
are
looking
to
grab
more
of
the
market
even
if
it
mildly
cannibalizes
some
of
their
own
brands
this
is
drinkable
for
the
masses
my
hypothesis
this
is
light
beer
for
people
who
dont
yet
want
to
admit
that
they
like
or
feel
the
need
for
low
calorie
products
emblazoned
with
that
word
light
a
positioning
against
miller
lite
more
than
a
beer
that
stands
on
any
merit
this
is
drinkable
in
the
same
sense
that
water
is
drinkable
not
much
there
to
offend
this
probably
does
taste
a
bit
better
than
budweiser
light
does
but
there
just
isnt
anything
here
for
a
beer
advocate
poured
clear
straw
no
smell
maybe
a
slight
sweet
husk
taste
was
very
watery
no
real
flavor
mouthfeel
was
like
carbonated
water
i
was
expecting
something
at
least
as
good
as
regular
bud
but
this
stuff
is
seriously
watery
and
tasteless
it
makes
bud
taste
like
craft
beer
well
not
quite
but
you
get
my
point
pours
out
to
a
standard
golden
color
in
the
glass
with
a
moderatesized
head
the
aroma
is
faint
and
smells
of
light
malt
the
taste
is
very
light
with
a
slight
residual
sweetness
it
tastes
like
budweiser
only
more
watered
down
honestly
this
should
be
called
bud
light
as
it
is
more
like
the
king
tougue
in
cheek
here
than
the
actual
bud
light
the
finish
is
indeed
lacking
as
it
has
no
aftertaste
just
as
they
planned
it
it
isnt
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
it
sure
could
use
a
bump
in
the
flavor
department
when
judged
against
michelob
ultra
aspen
edge
and
rolling
rock
green
light
it
comes
out
on
top
the
really
should
change
this
to
budweiser
antibeer
drinkability
ok
easy
to
have
more
than
one
if
you
want
i
still
cant
believe
this
is
a
low
carb
offering
drinkability
for
the
macro
croud
is
likely
to
be
high
i
am
having
a
tough
time
finishing
it
i
had
a
couple
of
these
on
tap
over
dinner
during
a
trip
this
week
with
little
else
to
choose
from
i
thought
that
this
would
be
an
interesting
brew
to
try
the
beer
is
extraordinarily
light
colored
with
a
fizzy
sodapop
head
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
cereal
grain
and
carbonic
fizzthats
about
it
the
beer
is
lighter
and
has
less
taste
than
traditional
budweiser
its
like
a
grain
flavored
water
some
hops
in
the
finish
which
is
watery
and
hollow
serious
disappointment
pours
a
very
very
pale
yellow
with
a
decent
snow
white
head
i
mean
this
is
a
pale
pale
beer
aroma
still
trying
to
find
one
maybe
a
bit
of
crispness
but
nothing
jumps
out
taste
is
intially
a
light
touch
of
maltiness
followed
by
a
crisp
dryness
followed
by
nothing
hey
they
did
get
of
the
aftertaste
and
damn
near
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
the
before
and
during
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
honestly
after
a
couple
of
sips
you
wonder
if
anything
is
there
my
guess
is
that
the
increase
in
hops
was
just
to
let
you
know
that
you
didnt
pick
up
the
bottle
of
seltzer
instead
if
you
think
mich
ultra
is
insipid
at
least
it
had
the
cojones
to
admit
what
it
was
budweiser
select
makes
one
think
its
something
special
which
it
definately
is
not
ill
give
it
the
ol
a
for
effort
its
a
definite
step
up
from
the
low
standards
set
by
other
lowcarb
beers
the
splashy
packaging
and
anheiserbusch
pedigree
will
probably
be
enough
to
make
this
a
market
leader
if
it
ever
gets
released
into
distribution
judging
by
the
halffull
displays
and
cold
cases
apparently
im
an
outlier
for
not
calling
this
the
worst
beer
on
the
planet
honestly
i
thought
it
was
plenty
smooth
inoffensive
and
went
fine
with
my
japanese
food
id
rather
have
this
than
a
large
bunch
of
the
awful
craft
out
there
typical
mass
produced
beer
abinbev
owns
this
now
and
it
is
brewed
in
usa
light
flavor
gold
color
average
skunklike
flavor
this
beer
had
a
moderate
sweet
taste
that
disappeared
quickly
there
was
also
a
low
level
of
carbonation
if
i
have
another
i
will
want
it
really
cold
and
only
to
quench
a
thirst
clearly
not
a
session
beer
goes
down
easy
but
so
do
a
lot
of
things
rjt
half
finger
head
on
a
clear
straw
to
bright
golden
colored
body
aroma
is
minimal
with
grains
and
some
sweet
corn
flavor
is
the
same
but
i
am
happy
there
are
no
off
putting
flavors
although
little
flavor
is
there
at
all
light
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
easy
to
drink
not
flavorful
but
nothing
really
to
turn
you
off
basically
slightly
bitter
water
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
this
is
probably
one
of
the
less
offensive
light
lagers
as
it
at
least
still
has
some
taste
to
it
would
not
be
on
the
top
of
the
list
of
beers
to
have
again
i
am
not
sure
if
i
will
try
this
once
again
too
pricey

is
downright
weak
maybe
a
hint
of

very
water
like
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
was
lacking
in
flavor
even
for
this
style
really
wasnt
much
to
speak
of
lots
of
water
more
bitterness
than
it
should
have
given
the
lack
of
much
substance
to
the
beer
prickly
carbonation
pretty
clean
overall
except
the
bitterness
must
be
a
decent
use
of
rice
to
this
beer
my
initial
pour
netted
me
twoplus
fingers
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
extremely
limited
retention
hey
i
realize
that
i
am
not
the
handsomest
of
guys
but
do
you
have
to
take
off
so
quickly
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
i
have
urinated
darker
water
than
this
nose
had
a
faint
lagercorn
adjunct
sweetness
but
it
was
all
pretty
mild
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
with
only
the
barest
of
taste
in
the
mouth
i
am
glad
it
was
nearing
my
bedtime
as
this
was
a
major
snoozeathon
holy
boring
batman
finish
was
equally
band
and
hohum
making
for
a
lessthanscintillating
experience
that
said
i
do
not
feel
that
i
should
dun
it
too
badly
i
knew
what
i
was
buying
but
i
had
never
seen
it
before
either
in
can
or
bottle
and
i
have
certainly
had
much
worse
including
from
the
style
hey
it
beats
a
cup
of
tea
before
retirement
i
promise
you
dont
avoid
it
if
it
is
one
of
the
few
options
open
to
you
it
could
be
the
lesser
of
several
evils
overall
very
drinkable
beer
but
why
would
you
pay
money
for
a
beer
with
no

only
drank
this
one
because
i
needed

with
my
wife
to
a
nice
sushi
place
in
roslindale
after
looking

went

never

have
any

was

certainly
had
no

putting
this
down

at

and
being
a

unfortunately
it

the

the

however
expresses

to
believe
theres
just
a
mild

its

it
doesnt
really
finish
as

the

just

disappointing
what
would
be
the
politically
correct
term
for
this
beer
japanese
american
light
crap
please
this
beer
is
horrible
and
now
it
is
brewed
in
the
us
like
that
would
make
any
difference
other
than
someone
cutting
costs
to
line
their
pockets
this
is
an
excellent
light
beer
way
better
than
bud
or
coors
has
a
nice
crisp
taste
though
it
is
watery

favorite
light
beer
besides
sam

light
from
a

clean

not
much
beer
flavor
slightly

this
is
what
i
grew
up
on
so
i
cant
hate
it
still
a
good
beer
goes
down
way

easy
could
easily
drink
about

watered

beer
almost
seems
skunky
will
only
drink
when
it

i
absolutely
love
this
beer
it
explains
my
name
best
light
beer
money
can
buy
for
the
style
and
cheapness
my
favorite
one
out

would

in

than
bud

again
on
average
i
probably
drink
more
michelob
golden
light
than
any
other
beer
from
any
other
brewer
i
buy
this
in
the
cases
its
just
so
easy
grab
it
and
dont
think
its
just
great
with
anything
and
flavorful
everything
is
just
right
it
is
in
my
opinion
the
ideal
light
beer
pours
a
lighteryellow
in
color
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
that
settles
down
to
mostly
the
sides
of
the
glass
not
much
of
a
aroma
actually
just
some
grain
with
light
hops
carbonation
is
above
normal
but
not
bad
taste
was
about
the
same
but
is
a
little
on
the
watery
side
but
i
like
this
one
and
not
a
fan
overall
for
bud
products
on
a
really
hot
day
and
if
it
is
very
cold
it
can
be
tolerated
and
even
can
be
refreshing
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
actually
quenches
thirst
and
no
aftertaste
very
refreshing
light
taste
not
bitter
or
thick
tasting
no
beer
breath
i
just
love
this
beer
didnt
feel
full
either
after
drinking
highly
recommended
unless
you
like
thick
malty
dark
beers
enjoyed
at
the
brewery
in
st
louis
1
5
finger
head
with
poor
retention
on
a
clear
bright
golden
body
this
beer
is
pretty
much
odorless
flavor
is
also
really
mild
with
mostly
light
grain
and
rice
no
hop
or
supporting
flavors
but
also
not
bitter
or
off
putting
light
body
ad
high
carbonation
incredibly
boring
beer
obviously
easy
to
drink
but
also
its
lack
of
flavor
will
bore
you
into
not
wanting
another
rjt
i
dont
like
to
unfairly
bash
beers
like
this
but
this
just
isnt
enjoyable
halfway
decent
at
times
till
the
garbage
juice
flavor
hits
you
for
some
reason
its
huge
in
the
midwest
and
seems
to
be
at
almost
every
bar
i
go
to
its
always
cheap
as
dirt
but
even
at
a
good
price
it
isnt
worth
it
this
beer
is
light
beer
so
i
will
compare
it
to
other
light
beers
it
does
not
compare
to
more
roboust
beers
as
it
is
not
meant
to
be
the
flavor
was
decent
and
it
went
down
easy
if
there
was
a
drinkability
rating
it
would
get
a
4
5
the
color
was
as
expected
for
its
style
light
golden
transparent
it
was
priced
right
at
3
for
a
20oz
draft
on
happy
hour
the
flavor
was
mild
but
still
decent
for
its
style
i
did
not
feel
like
i
ate
a
meal
after
a
couple
if
you
like
like
light
beer
i
would
recommend
trying
this
one
final
thoughts
while
not
the
worst
macrolager
michelob
golden
light
is
definitely
lowclass
its
the
usual
choice
for
frat
parties
and
other
mindless
drinking
activities
but
has
absolutely
no
place
in
a
now
booming
beer
industry
full
of
such
better
options
overall
a
regional
beer
that
i
think
might
have
success
elsewhere
outside
of
the
midwest
cant
believe
i
used
to
like
this
stuff
its
easy
drinking
but
why
it
has
no
flavor
thanks
to
cpolking
for
sending
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
sweetness
to
it
taste
is
also
mild
a
touch
of
sweet
malts
light
and
easy
drinking
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
while
nothing
offensive
there
is
nothing
to
separate
it
from
other
light
beers
this
is
much
better
than
i
remember
its
what
it
is
for
the
style
you
can
consume
it
but
overall
its
nothing
youd
want
to
trade
for
or
mention
twice
light
bodied
a
lot
of
carbonation
no
real
aftertaste
nothing
here
which
merits
trying
this
again
i
had
this
at
a
holiday
get
together
with
the
relatives
and
decided
to
try
it
you
cannot
expect
much
from
this
style
or
you
will
be
sorely
disappointed
i
expect
very
little
and
so
these
types
of
beers
usually
live
down
to
my
expectations
i
got
maybe
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
from
my
glug
but
while
i
was
typing
it
vanished
into
the
atmosphere
color
was
a
light
lemonyellow
and
it
had
the
transparency
of
one
of
the
slides
that
i
plan
to
use
on
the
overhead
projector
tomorrow
come
on
give
me
something
to
work
with
throw
this
dog
a
bone
so
that
he
may
do
so
in
return
nose
smelled
like
watery
silage
which
in
case
you
are
just
tuning
in
is
the
fermented
corn
cobs
stored
in
silos
for
feeding
pigs
later
on
after
the
harvest
season
it
is
sweetish
and
actually
not
offputting
until
you
smell
it
in
glass
after
glass
of
beer
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
and
i
was
beginning
to
doubt
my
objectiveness
at
this
point
by
gar
i
have
reviewed
this
beer
in
one
of
its
forms
or
another
on
a
seemingly
endless
basis
which
is
why
many
have
begun
to
question
my
sanity
finish
was
equally
thin
and
watery
and
i
thought
wistfully
of
the
odouls
amber
that
i
had
just
finished
which
others
had
dunned
and
i
had
enjoyed
i
did
not
enjoy
this
i
would
not
waste
cooler
space
on
this
what
more
needs
to
be
said
o
terrible
2nd
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
dont
even
try
it
for
kicks
o
meh
its
about
on
par
with
most
light
lagers
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
common
conception
of
the
style
o
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
very
easily
and
not
filling
at
all
since
there
isnt
much
to
the
beer
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
at
least
typical
fizzy
yellow
light
beer
edit
edited
taste
section
to
account
for
the
factor
of
environmental
temperature
fluctuation
summertime
in
a
clear
glass
does
nothing
for
the
flavor
of
this
beer
id
have
been
much
better
served
by
drinking
it
straight
from
the
can
im
also
reminded
by
the
annoying
aftertaste
that
this
particular
beer
leaves
behind
which
reminds
me
very
much
of
the
aftertaste
which
always
made
me
dislike
diet
soda
pop
in
general
i
had
to
crack
the
nearest
can
of
leinies
original
just
to
get
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
o
very
easy
to
drink
probably
the
beer
ive
had
the
most
out
of
all
other
bmc
beers
it
is
refreshing
taste
as
youd
expect
no
malt
or
hop
quality
to
speak
of
nothing
tastes
bad
just
nothing
tastes
so
its
a
good
palate
cleanser
if
you
think
drinking
water
is
for
pussies
theres
just
not
much
to
speak
of
here
when
water
is
the
predominant
quality
in
a
beer
ive
had
worse
this
isnt
painful
to
drink
or
anything
unless
youre
jonesing
for
some
beer
or
a
buzz
overall
this
is
probably
ab
best
brew
buy
some
and
serve
to
your
freeloading
freinds
o
cheap
easytoconsume
but
not
fun
to
taste
beer
such
low
alcohol
and
taste
content
that
it
finishes
quickly
before
you
realize
it
did
taste
better
than
bud
however
as
i
tasted
the
two
alongside
each
other
to
compare
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
slightly
malty
grainy
and
ricy
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
with
too
much
grainsrice
light
body
a
thirst
quencher
only
overall
there
is
absolutely
nothing
about
this
beer
that
is
enjoyable
for
me
i
dont
judge
those
that
enjoy
it
but
it
is
not
for
me
finish
skunk
light
grassiness
if
you
ask
me
if
i
want
another
no
thank
you
overall
they
are
almost
all
the
same
and
universally
just
ehh
ut
what
can
you
do
d
like
most
light
macrobrews
this
drinks
like
unflavored
mineral
water
i
only
review
it
because
it
is
technically
a
beer
now
dont
get
me
wrong
here
on
the
rating
i
love
eastern
european
ale
such
as
belhaven
stouts
and
new
castle
and
dark
mexican
beers
but
have
switched
to
only
drinking
them
sometimes
working
one
the
lowcarb
diet
and
low
cal
beers
to
try
to
maintain
weight
tried
all
of
them
that
i
know
of
and
bud
55
is
water
tastes
like
it
mgd
64
is
little
better
but
not
much
and
is
somewhat
drinkable
the
mich
golden
light
is
better
than
the
previous
2
except
mich
ultra
light
better
taste
and
does
not
make
you
feel
as
your
drinking
water
thats
not
saying
much
but
remember
i
am
comparing
the
mich
gl
to
those
lowcarb
beers
low
calorie
beers
in
the
real
world
of
real
beers
it
pretty
much
sucks
too
but
there
you
go
nothing
good
to
be
had
from
this
one
not
worth
even
a
try
d
the
only
reason
i
had
this
in
my
fridge
was
because
i
was
entertaining
a
girl
that
cant
drink
the
thick
and
gross
craft
beer
i
drink
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
anybody
and
feel
like
ive
insulted
my
taste
buds
by
even
pouring
this
in
my
mouth
call
me
a
beer
snob
if
you
will
i
just
enjoy
more
flavorful
beer
drinkability
this
beer
is
not
offensive
and
you
cant
spend
the
whole
day
night
drinking
russian
imperial
stouts
can
you
also
a
perfect
compliment
to
a
bloody
mary
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
not
worth
it
grainy
thin
slightly
dry
thin
aftertaste
thin
i
call
these
beers
road
sodas
to
encourage
people
to
drink
and
drive
theres
nothing
to
it
nothing
to
say
theres
probably
trace
formaldehyde
in
this
beer
slowly
giving
the
consumers
cancer
time
for
some
bad
beer
epidemiology
never
again
i
say
overall
this
is
nothing
special
but
a
solid
go
to
cheap
macro
easy
drinking
and
light
as
can
be
i
did
a
das
boot
to
finish
this
one
off
great
drinkability
i
have
to
admit
to
one
thing
about
this
beer
on
a
very
very
hot
afternoon
after
cutting
the
lawn
trimming
the
trees
walking
the
dogs
putting
new
plugs
in
the
car
changing
the
oil
in
the
same
car
rotating
the
tires
on
the
same
car
taking
the
dogs
for
a
walk
again
moving
the
hoses
on
the
garden
oh
crap
i
forgot
to
mention
pushing
the
trim
mower
all
around
the
back
yard
this
beer
really
fills
the
bill
and
i
can
drink
a
6er
d
reallyalthough
perhaps
as
a
newly
initiated
college
student
i
may
have
thought
this
palatableit
is
absolutely
horrible
adjuncts
combined
with
a
few
other
unidentified
ingredients
make
an
attempt
to
make
this
tasteless
but
end
up
making
it
taste
like
watereddown
corn
and
grain
not
my
finest
beer
tasting
moment
i
was
impressed
with
the
beers
fruityslightly
sweet
character
the
smoothness
of
this
particular
beer
was
also
very
enjoyable
i
found
the
fruit
hard
to
narrow
down
at
times
it
seemed
citrusy
and
others
hinted
of
berry
overall
the
fruity
taste
wasnt
overbearing
to
the
extreme
that
some
other
fruit
beers
have
which
is
great
since
this
isnt
really
a
fruit
beer
in
the
conventional
sense
would
definitely
drink
again
even
if
it
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
d
this
is
mostly
what
i
like
about
the
beer
it
goes
down
very
easy
without
anyhting
there
to
offend
the
tastebuds
i
like
to
keep
a
lot
of
these
macro
beers
in
the
bottle
making
the
beer
a
little
more
substantial
and
easier
to
drink
i
cant
hate
this
beer
i
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
it
but
i
cant
throw
praise
at
it
either
the
beer
is
decent
it
serves
a
purpose
but
is
nothing
to
praise
from
the
rooftops
about
if
you
never
try
it
youre
not
missing
anything
but
if
i
never
tried
it
i
may
have
missed
everything
drinkability
was
fine
i
got
it
down
with
no
problem
towards
the
end
as
it
warmed
up
it
started
to
get
less
drinkable
though
drink
em
cold
and
drink
em
fast
and
you
will
be
okay
this
is
my
favorite
cheap
beer
why
well
its
not
particularly
distinctive
but
its
crisp
refreshing
no
off
flavors
and
no
rotgut
throw
it
in
a
cooler
full
of
icewater
provide
it
to
your
undiscerning
friends
and
enjoy
a
sunny
day
on
the
lake
heck
i
throw
a
lime
in
it
i
know
i
know
i
shouldnt
fruit
the
beer
and
normally
i
dont
and
its
a
lot
cheaper
than
all
those
clear
bottled
mexican
lagers
its
an
american
macro
but
so
what
mich
golden
light
is
good
for
the
type
of
beer
that
it
is
pours
clear
yellowgolden
color
13
inch
head
of
white
color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
yeast
adjunct
pale
malt
and
slight
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
light
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
grain
sweet
malt
pale
malt
yeast
and
adjunct
overall
a
pretty
average
light
lager
d
definitely
good
for
a
kegger
or
drinking
games
do
i
really
enjoy
it
though
not
a
ton
but
a
little
id
also
like
to
add
that
ive
never
gotten
a
hangover
from
drinking
this
beer
excessively
pours
a
light
clear
straw
yellow
with
little
head
that
dissipates
immediately
little
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
like
water
and
cereal
am
i
drinking
beer
here
or
adjunct
flavored
water
there
is
really
nothing
to
this
beer
other
than
the
water
and
light
cereal
flavors
with
moderate
carbonation
at
least
its
not
offensive
marketed
as
a
real
trendy
beer
here
in
minnesota
but
im
not
enjoying
it
probably
would
prefer
this
to
a
miller
lite
or
bud
light
though
overall
if
this
is
beer
then
what
the
hell
have
i
been
drinking
another
cheap
buzz
it
is
what
it
is
i
hope
to
never
touch
this
stuff
again
not
too
bad
for
a
light
macro
this
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
the
average
macro
head
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
nose
and
taste
and
very
grainy
with
a
bit
of
ricey
hops
the
body
is
also
very
light
too
much
carbonation
to
enjoy
this
stuff
doesnt
have
much
going
on
but
it
is
not
too
bad
either
snuck
home
a
can
from
softball
where
this
beer
is
probably
a
close
second
to
miller
lite
for
postgame
drinking
not
too
bad
but
id
rather
have
miller
d
extremely
boring
and
nearly
flavorless
this
is
clean
and
flavorfree
like
sparkling
water
honestly
this
aint
half
bad
for
a
light
macro
lager
but
that
aint
sayin
much
md
overly
carbonated
and
very
thin
drinkable
beer
if
you
are
just
looking
to
drink
some
beers
pours
a
light
golden
color
duh
without
hardly
any
head
at
all
has
a
cool
faceted
can
smell
is
non
existent
i
really
cant
smell
anything
at
all
the
taste
is
ok
as
long
as
its
cold
when
i
was
first
getting
into
beer
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
but
it
was
one
that
i
could
never
get
around
where
i
live
so
whenever
i
got
to
have
some
it
was
a
big
treat
now
it
isnt
a
big
deal
but
i
tell
you
what
i
could
drink
about
11ty
of
these
and
still
be
ok
i
still
enjoy
it
every
now
and
then
atleast
for
nostalgics
sharp
crisp
mouthfeel
but
thats
about
it
watery
no
body
and
it
feels
like
its
going
to
make
me
burp
a
lot
typical
light
lager
no
better
no
worse
drinkable
in
a
desperate
situation
but
even
for
the
price
i
will
never
spend
my
own
money
on
this
beer
lets
just
say
if
this
was
the
last
beer
on
earth
id
switch
to
wine
d
this
ones
very
drinkable
through
the
years
ive
had
several
staple
beers
miller
high
life
coors
light
budweiser
select
and
michelob
light
but
i
keep
coming
back
to
michelob
light
as
long
as
you
dont
have
your
nose
in
it
the
beer
delivers
and
it
isnt
too
sweet
or
strong
tasting
to
serve
as
a
fine
staple
beer
some
one
left
this
bottle
orphaned
in
my
cooler
after
a
guys
weekend
so
i
inherited
it
along
with
5
wisconsin
capital
ambers
and
one
hacker
pshorr
oktoberfest
so
its
10
oclock
on
a
saturday
with
a
good
boxing
match
on
calzaghe
vs
kessler
so
after
round
one
i
sprinted
down
to
the
beer
fridge
and
picked
out
this
poor
soul
a
very
faint
aroma
some
carbonation
no
metalic
smell
to
it
theres
really
not
much
to
review
as
far
as
taste
goes
because
there
isnt
any
if
some
one
asked
you
hows
that
beer
taste
ive
never
had
it
youd
have
a
hard
time
responding
and
probably
would
just
give
them
one
because
they
arent
going
to
really
hate
it
or
really
love
it
and
drink
you
out
of
it
after
3
rounds
i
gratefully
went
and
got
a
captial
amber
to
finally
have
a
beer
with
the
boxing
match
drinkability
this
beer
was
crap
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
neighbor
brought
some
of
these
over
in
clear
bottles
they
are
pale
yellow
in
appearance
not
heavily
carbonated
no
need
to
worry
about
skunking
as
there
is
really
no
hopping
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
smooth
waterlike
drinkable
you
may
not
notice
that
it
is
beer
it
seems
to
me
that
ab
products
are
only
victorious
in
any
given
macro
smackdown
when
they
go
up
against
coors
products
i
like
the
corrugatedlike
cans
that
michelob
golden
draft
light
comes
in
and
the
cans
graphics
are
pretty
cool
but
the
beer
itself
sucks
like
theres
no
tomorrow
comes
in
a
plastic
cup
straw
yellow
and
fizzy
looking
the
odor
is
extremely
mild
almost
non
existent
maybe
there
is
a
little
rice
or
something
but
nothing
pleasant
the
taste
is
what
really
brings
this
beer
down
the
first
couple
sips
are
bearable
but
the
beer
just
continues
to
get
funkier
and
funkier
the
only
way
to
drink
this
beer
is
really
fast
when
it
is
really
cold
otherwise
dont
bother
at
all
overall
if
your
going
to
have
this
beer
i
would
suggest
having
it
on
tap
its
better
than
the
bottled
version
but
still
nothing
to
seek
out
d
better
than
bud
id
say
its
on
par
with
pbr
poured
from
the
bottle
beer
is
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
effervescent
head
smell
is
pretty
typical
of
a
macro
light
lager
just
a
slight
sweetness
of
grainy
malt
taste
is
also
of
corn
malt
and
adjuncts
as
a
light
beer
it
has
the
mouthfeel
of
water
as
i
had
expected
this
is
a
drinkable
light
beer
nothing
special
so
it
fits
the
profile
i
would
however
drink
this
beer
over
bud
light
if
i
had
the
choice
found
this
great
beer
at
the
tour
center
of
ab
in
st
louis
i
have
always
liked
michelob
light
but
golden
light
far
surpasses
regular
michelob
light
only
problem
is
that
it
is
not
sold
in
our
market
here
might
have
to
take
a
road
trip
north
to
get
some
of
this
excellent
michelob
d
not
a
staple
beer
it
is
drinakble
and
okay
for
the
style
michelob
golden
light
was
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
head
was
quick
disappear
leaving
very
little
lace
the
aroma
was
light
with
a
little
of
malt
and
grain
the
taste
was
very
light
as
well
rather
crisp
and
about
the
same
as
the
aroma
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
highly
carbonated
the
drinkability
was
below
average
its
just
another
nearly
tastless
light
lager
the
head
doesnt
really
exist
and
there
is
also
no
lacing
the
color
is
golden
and
clear
almost
like
water
smell
is
like
urine
taste
is
bad
doesnt
taste
anything
but
funky
really
carbonated
and
not
very
enjoyable
i
will
never
have
this
beer
again
the
beer
tasted
just
like
a
watered
down
michelob
lagar
it
was
very
light
in
color
and
had
a
light
taste
to
it
however
you
could
taste
that
flavor
that
all
the
michelob
products
have
i
was
good
and
if
i
were
at
a
party
dinking
a
lot
of
beer
i
could
possibly
drink
it
all
night
its
amazing
how
you
will
almost
never
find
this
beer
anywhere
out
side
minnesota
and
the
surrounding
states
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
almost
no
head
and
some
slight
lacing
smells
watered
down
and
grassy
taste
tastes
grainy
watered
down
and
a
little
malty
i
drink
this
alot
at
campus
partys
and
whatnot
i
can
tolerate
it
when
i
have
to
5
for
a
cup
but
i
would
never
go
out
and
buy
it
on
my
own
dmy
tastes
have
changed
quite
a
bit
over
the
past
few
yearsnot
liking
this
one
as
much
as
i
rememberneeds
more
flavor
just
too
light
still
it
could
do
on
a
hot
summer
day
by
the
pool
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
head
leaves
no
lace
around
glass
smell
was
pretty
water
but
with
hints
of
grain
and
a
bit
of
corn
taste
emulates
the
smell
for
the
most
part
light
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
wasnt
overcarbonated
like
most
macros
given
a
choice
i
probably
wouldnt
have
another
this
beer
came
a
slightly
tan
yellow
that
looked
dead
and
dirty
smelled
of
burnt
corn
and
foul
earth
tasted
of
creamed
corn
fried
eggs
that
were
left
in
the
pan
way
to
long
old
yeast
and
finished
much
like
i
would
expect
an
ashtray
to
taste
like
mouth
feel
was
medium
with
light
carbonation
there
are
light
beers
and
there
are
light
beer
wannabees
michelob
golden
light
draft
fits
the
latter
a
good
light
version
of
its
full
flavored
brother
poured
out
to
a
decent
golden
yellow
color
with
a
weak
head
no
notes
of
lace
around
the
glass
odors
were
watery
but
consisted
of
hops
and
grain
with
corn
in
the
background
flavor
was
consistant
with
odor
corn
weak
hops
and
a
note
of
tartness
finished
crisp
and
well
for
a
light
lager
worth
a
try
for
light
lager
fans
thin
mouth
that
the
carbonation
can
not
over
come
drinkable
in
a
pinch
but
there
must
be
something
better
on
about
any
beer
list
just
picture
the
clamor
when
we
realized
the
whole
bar
was
free
and
there
was
no
need
to
stick
to
this
swill
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
and
it
goes
down
perfect
this
is
the
kind
of
college
kid
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
actually
drinking
every
once
in
a
while
all
of
my
friends
love
this
beer
i
think
they
are
crazy
it
is
a
pale
yellow
lager
with
a
bitter
flavor
and
a
generic
macro
light
beer
body
i
only
drink
this
beer
when
there
is
nothing
else
available
i
should
have
went
up
to
the
bar
and
had
a
summit
oktoberfest
instead
what
a
waste
of
time
money
and
liver
aside
from
the
almost
clear
yellow
color
and
it
tasting
like
water
i
find
no
reason
why
anyone
would
drink
this
granted
every
one
here
in
mn
drinks
it
like
water
about
the
only
good
thing
i
can
think
of
about
this
beer
is
the
price
about
17
for
a
case
of
bottles
oh
i
almost
forgot
the
cool
bottle
thanks
for
letting
me
raid
your
macro
selection
zap
while
this
may
be
overrated
by
some
of
the
macro
lovers
i
think
this
underrated
by
a
lot
of
micro
lovers
a
billion
times
better
than
bud
light
and
also
better
than
miller
light
coors
light
a
host
of
others
a
great
lawnmowereasy
drinker
macro
light
being
from
the
midwest
and
a
current
student
of
the
university
of
minnesota
michelob
golden
draft
light
is
the
finest
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
this
is
indeed
the
most
popular
beer
on
campus
and
in
minnesota
a
whole
state
can
not
be
wrong
mich
gold
light
is
one
of
the
most
refreshing
crisp
tasting
beers
on
the
market
you
can
drink
in
the
boat
in
the
fishing
shack
or
at
a
kegger
as
the
replacments
from
minneapolis
sing
all
i
wanna
do
is
drink
beer
for
breakfast
no
doubt
they
were
singing
about
this
beer
mich
gold
light
might
not
be
a
very
full
beer
but
it
sure
is
the
best
light
beer
on
the
market
i
feel
bad
for
the
people
who
live
on
the
coasts
it
is
indeed
a
smooth
premium
beer
this
stuff
is
marketed
heavily
in
minnesota
and
the
upper
midwest
in
fact
i
think
it
is
only
distributed
here
it
is
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
i
drank
it
out
of
its
unique
paneled
bottle
its
very
bland
and
nonintrusive
a
little
malt
an
absence
of
hops
still
it
watery
tasting
and
not
worth
your
while
the
only
reason
i
give
this
beer
a
2
is
because
it
is
my
favorite
light
beer
if
there
is
such
a
thing
its
good
for
young
folks
drinking
it
out
of
a
keg
for
some
reason
this
isnt
sold
many
places
i
was
always
under
the
impression
it
was
only
in
mn
anyways
you
cant
find
it
very
often
out
of
that
state
nothing
special
by
any
means
this
is
very
popular
though
i
dont
know
why
this
pours
very
light
yellow
with
almost
no
head
taste
is
very
watered
down
with
very
little
hops
or
anything
else
to
speak
of
extremely
grainy
tasting
with
husk
notes
i
have
nothing
good
to
say
about
this
why
is
this
crap
so
popular
very
watery
and
somewhat
bland
i
liked
the
bottle
shape
it
that
counts
for
anything
not
much
going
on
with
this
beer
had
this
over
the
weekend
too
probably
the
worst
beer
ever
made
maybe
even
worse
than
coors
light
its
like
drinking
bad
tasting
seltzer
water
i
imagine
the
only
redeeeming
quality
of
this
beer
is
um
well
i
cant
think
of
one
right
now
but
it
was
free
anyway
light
malty
almost
skunky
aroma
full
head
and
fizzy
pale
gold
and
crystal
clear
light
in
overall
taste
whats
there
is
malt
then
light
to
medium
dryness
from
hops
very
carbonated
crisp
and
thirst
quenching
just
not
enough
flavor
rjt
pours
a
lighter
to
medium
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
cap
that
settles
down
to
just
a
ring
around
the
glass
not
much
lacing
is
seen
just
a
couple
of
very
light
spots
the
aroma
isnt
really
all
that
much
just
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
pretty
much
is
said
for
the
taste
actually
isnt
all
that
bad
and
probbaly
the
best
of
the
ultra
micks
lighterbodied
with
decent
carbonation
its
drinkable
but
that
is
about
all
i
am
going
to
go
with
feel
exceptionally
light
and
watery
body
crisp
medium
carbonation
theres
nothing
offensive
about
this
its
a
slightly
flavored
beer
with
low
alcohol
and
a
very
thin
feel
i
detect
a
touch
of
barley
malt
caramel
and
roasted
nut
swimming
in
a
pool
of
water
if
i
want
to
drink
light
and
get
a
buzz
and
a
bit
of
flavor
this
would
be
a
go
to
not
even
good
for
a
knock
back
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summers
afternoon
does
this
mean
ill
have
to
pour
the
rest
of
the
12
pack
down
the
drain
its
good
sometimes
better
than
keystone
or
busch
this
beer
had
a
slight
carbonated
feel
to
it
not
especially
strong
taste
wise
and
i
consider
this
a
party
beer
where
quantity
wins
out
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
especially
on
a
hot
southern
summer
day
appearance
was
of
good
color
and
it
had
a
nice
aroma
that
was
not
off
the
mark
from
its
taste
overall
dont
expect
too
much
here
but
really
should
you
really
be
expecting
tons
with
a
ultra
low
cal
beer
the
look
was
typical
of
a
michelob
beer
which
is
ok
poor
was
a
light
white
head
that
was
gone
as
quickly
as
it
came
the
color
was
a
bit
pale
compared
to
that
of
other
amber
beer
taste
was
over
powered
by
carbonation
but
after
wasnt
bad
not
to
much
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
it
would
be
a
good
crisp
beer
on
a
hot
day
with
a
decent
taste
i
would
buy
it
again
for
that
reason
only
light
golden
amber
in
color
clean
and
clear
moderate
cap
of
bone
white
froth
so
far
so
good
scent
pale
and
nonexistent
only
positive
is
no
offnotes
same
with
taste
pale
and
faint
hint
of
malt
that
is
neither
sweet
or
toasted
no
off
notes
light
bodied
bubbly
nothing
much
going
on
here
but
id
take
it
over
any
other
bmc
light
product
as
it
didnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
offnotes
over
all
been
there
done
that
moving
on
now
this
is
an
incredibly
light
beer
with
little
flavor
its
crisp
and
very
easy
to
drink
as
is
expected
the
off
notes
are
enough
to
ruin
this
one
i
wont
buy
it
again
o
this
is
a
great
light
beer
from
now
on
it
is
my
go
to
light
beer
while
it
does
have
less
flavor
than
other
light
beers
like
bud
miller
and
coors
light
the
flavor
that
is
there
is
far
superior
not
as
tasty
as
the
original
michelob
ultra
in
fact
you
cannot
taste
any
malt
or
barley
at
all
in
this
it
really
just
tastes
like
water
and
weak
hops
the
flavor
is
not
too
offensives
but
it
doesnt
have
the
fresh
clean
flavor
of
michelob
ultra
it
tastes
a
little
stale
i
would
not
suggest
drinking
this
unless
there
were
no
other
options
available
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
but
not
good
12
oz
bottle
pours
amber
with
some
white
head
and
a
soda
like
carbonation
and
not
much
lacing
nose
is
similar
to
lemonade
body
is
thin
and
watery
taste
includes
some
sweetness
followed
by
an
abrupt
dryness
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
hops
nice
sinkhole
beer
this
is
perfect
for
filler
nothing
to
love
or
hate
i
guess
this
is
better
than
regular
michelob
ultra
but
there
really
isnt
anything
here
that
would
make
it
worth
drinking
again
interesting
sidenote
i
offered
a
taste
to
someone
who
only
drinks
light
just
as
a
test
not
telling
her
what
it
was
she
usually
hates
the
beers
i
drink
but
she
liked
this
one
overy
crisp
beer
but
if
you
dont
focus
on
the
taste
youll
quickly
forget
it
has
one
there
are
no
real
negative
qualities
other
than
an
overall
lack
of
flavor
but
it
is
very
very
easy
to
drink
d
better
than
most
of
the
light
crap
out
there
but
in
no
way
a
worthy
beer
taste
was
thin
even
though
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
chewy
by
any
means
light
corn
and
caramel
taste
thin
seems
to
be
the
operative
word
in
this
review
but
its
a
light
beer
and
for
the
weird
dichotomy
of
drinking
beer
and
counting
calories
this
is
one
of
the
dare
i
say
superior
choices
in
such
a
conundrum
i
dont
see
why
they
cant
have
hops
in
the
beer
though
i
mean
those
arent
going
to
add
caloricly
speaking
i
think
as
far
as
the
new
ultra
light
beers
go
ie
bud
select
mgd
64
select
55
ect
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
cheers
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
faint
malts
taste
is
also
mild
some
malts
a
touch
of
bitterness
nothing
special
but
not
the
worst
light
beer
i
have
tasted
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
not
that
bad
as
far
as
light
beers
go
d
better
than
a
lot
of
macro
light
beers
refreshing
summertime
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
pours
a
nice
amber
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
onefinger
plus
white
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
very
light
hop
note
with
some
funky
cornrice
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
but
with
the
classic
macro
taste
light
body
not
drinkable
started
off
pretty
good
but
still
not
worth
buying
again
a
suggestion
drink
this
beer
while
munching
on
some
peanuts
allergens
or
lack
thereof
provided
it
compliments
them
so
well
not
really
sure
why
but
just
try
it
im
not
a
health
freak
and
i
like
my
beers
heavy
and
calorieladen
but
on
the
offchance
that
i
go
work
out
and
need
to
rehydrate
afterward
ill
definitely
reach
for
a
mich
ultra
amber
or
five
d
i
like
this
beer
way
better
than
the
regular
ultra
or
the
fruity
flavored
ultras
if
i
were
forced
to
choose
a
low
calorie
beer
this
would
be
the
one
pours
a
moderate
amber
brown
with
a
slight
off
white
head
leaves
behind
a
tad
bit
of
lacing
nose
brings
forth
some
amber
malt
and
grain
husks
taste
is
pretty
weak
really
not
much
going
on
here
feel
is
light
too
light
drinks
okay
and
is
one
of
the
better
4
99
six
packs
around
but
nothing
too
special
overall
what
can
you
say
i
knew
what
this
one
was
going
to
be
going
in
and
my
opinion
was
about
dead
on
not
the
worst
by
far
nut
nothing
really
interesting
either
drinkability
ehh
its
not
tough
to
drink
but
id
choose
others
over
this
adjunct
flavors
begin
to
rear
their
ugly
head
in
the
flavor
and
are
mildly
offset
by
a
watery
caramel
presence
carbonation
level
is
high
and
the
mouthfeel
is
expectedly
thin
really
not
much
flavor
at
all
but
it
is
probably
better
than
threequarters
of
light
lagers
grainy
cardboard
comes
out
as
it
warms
up
and
goes
progressively
downhill
from
there
update
52310
theyve
reformulated
this
to
lower
the
calories
further
its
been
reduced
from
114
calories
to
95
and
the
alcohol
was
cut
from
5
to
3
2
unfortunately
this
came
at
the
expense
of
taste
its
pretty
watery
tasting
now
not
much
different
than
regular
mich
ultra
while
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
original
formula
this
new
one
is
really
bad
i
cant
stand
michelob
ultra
but
i
really
do
enjoy
the
amber
version
im
so
tired
of
most
light
beers
so
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
its
a
very
light
beer
with
decent
taste
i
buy
this
pretty
often
and
i
suggest
it
to
my
friends
i
dont
want
to
try
the
other
flavored
ultras
though
they
scare
me
unfortunately
not
even
as
good
as
your
typical
bmc
swill
poured
into
a
12oz
glass
and
was
in
no
danger
of
spilling
a
drop
theres
virtually
no
head
and
anything
that
did
form
was
gone
after
i
blinked
i
wouldnt
call
the
color
amber
if
anything
is
was
a
slightly
darker
shade
of
normal
fyb
smell
was
tinny
and
metallic
with
some
sort
of
maltlike
smell
this
tasted
awful
like
stagnant
carbonated
water
has
the
feel
too
of
water
id
rather
drink
water
you
can
chug
this
which
is
the
only
reason
it
didnt
get
a
1
but
why
would
you
want
to
maybe
my
girlfriends
dad
will
drink
the
rest
of
the
sixer
d
just
another
lawn
mowing
beer
drinkability
is
ok
if
you
are
watching
your
carbs
this
might
be
the
beer
for
you
from
bottle
to
shaker

pours
a
light
clear
amber
with
minimal
head
diminishing
well
lets
just
say
it
is
what
it
is
a
very
light
beer
with
a
bit
more
pizzaz
and
flavor
than
regular
ultra
a
clear
choice
over
its
bland
sister
if
these
are
the
only
two
you
have
to
choose
from
other
than
that
well
i
just
would
not
purchase
d
pretty
drinkable
its
tastier
than
i
thought
but
by
no
means
tasty
by
my
normal
standards
i
would
drink
again
as
a
light
lager
its
much
better
than
the
light
adjuncts
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
carbonated
wateryness
the
beers
drinkability
rates
a
3
based
on
the
ease
of
drinking
the
beer
honestly
it
would
bore
me
too
much
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
week
saw
this
and
was
intrigued
ive
had
watery
brew
before
ultra
but
amber
watery
brew
may
be
different
plus
the
temps
are
climbing
and
a
good
refresher
is
always
needed
first
off
looking
at
the
carbs
it
actually
has
about
50
more
than
ultra
hmmm
interesting
smells
like
an
amber
brew
not
outstandingly
but
its
there
pours
to
an
light
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
taste
is
thin
but
does
have
hints
of
an
amber
brew
with
a
slight
maltiness
and
a
mild
twang
of
hops
carbonation
isnt
too
high
but
due
to
the
lack
of
backbone
does
override
the
flavor
this
is
definitely
not
a
connoisseurs
beer
but
i
doubt
any
connoisseur
is
going
to
buy
a
self
proclaimed
low
carb
brew
it
is
what
it
is
i
rate
it
what
it
proclaims
to
be
not
even
next
to
one
of
my
red
ale
homebrews
for
wicked
hot
weather
working
outside
this
would
be
tough
to
top
although
at
5
ac
i
wouldnt
be
wielding
a
chainsaw
cheers
why
drink
this
when
you
can
go
for
a
regular
amber
ale
if
you
like
your
beer
as
close
to
water
as
possible
this
may
be
for
you
i
cant
be
too
sure
d
very
drinkable
since
there
was
very
little
taste
and
it
was
very
light
feeling
ive
had
a
lot
worse
lite
beers
and
this
really
isnt
that
bad
not
great
mind
you
not
particularly
good
either
but
not
bad
drinkable
and
okay
the
beer
certainly
looks
good
with
an
amber
color
loads
of
efforvescence
and
carbonation
the
carbonation
is
prodigious
there
is
a
fairly
creamy
head
that
laces
and
retains
well
im
surprised
by
that
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
better
than
most
adjunct
lagers
there
is
a
dextrin
sweetness
some
sweet
maltiness
that
is
hard
to
pin
down
with
specificity
a
slight
earthy
and
musty
aroma
too
the
beer
is
creamy
ultra
light
watery
sweet
with
no
real
flavor
i
can
see
why
people
drink
this
you
could
down
lots
of
these
because
there
is
just
not
much
body
taste
character
or
hop
presence
in
the
beer
it
is
a
carbonated
malty
beverage
that
is
largely
inoffensive
thats
about
all
you
can
say
the
amber
in
the
name
is
in
reference
to
the
color
of
the
beer
and
nothing
more
dad
handed
me
a
bottle
so
what
are
you
gonna
do
the
beer
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
compact
white
head
that
gives
up
the
ghost
quickly
minimal
lacing
faint
grainy
malt
aroma
light
seltzer
water
body
with
light
grain
and
malt
flavors
the
finish
is
absolutely
flavorless
unless
you
call
bubbles
a
flavor
truly
a
beer
for
people
who
do
not
like
beer
after
drinking
it
i
realized
why
its
discontinued
but
mostly
i
was
confused
why
was
it
even
bottled
and
sold
to
the
public
not
a
good
beer
at
all
very
light
tasting
which
is
not
what
you
expect
or
want
in
an
amber
at
all
a
weird
aftertaste
no
good
feel
just
a
poor
beer
all
around
drinkability
very
easy
better
than
alot
of
low
carb
beers
d
4
5
this
is
a
very
solid
session
light
beer
great
price
great
on
calories
and
great
on
abv
5
0
this
beats
all
other
light
american
lagers
hands
down
if
you
like
light
beers
with
more
character
than
this
is
your
beer
try
it
it
is
my
first
pick
if
i
am
on
a
session
of
light
beers
with
hig
abv
but
still
have
some
decent
taste
after
drinking
a
few
michelob
ultras
i
was
ready
to
be
disappointed
here
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
one
had
a
decent
appearance
and
what
is
this
taste
theres
some
good
flavors
going
on
here
and
its
enjoyable
and
flavorabble
to
drink
granted
it
can
be
a
lot
better
but
its
cheap
tastes
good
what
else
can
you
want
so
uh
yeah
if
youre
thirsty
this
is
not
offensive
but
it
is
really
lacking
taste
ive
had
water
with
more
taste
than
this
who
would
have
guessed
this
was
a
light
beer
its
not
as
obviously
watered
down
like
others
but
one
bottle
will
do
me
just
fine
notes
overall
it
has
a
simple
clean
flavor
with
a
light
body
thats
easy
drinking
also
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
little
bit
better
than
the
regular
michelob
ultra
the
taste
was
very
mild
watered
down
it
was
smooth
but
simply
for
the
fact
that
there
was
not
that
much
taste
drinkability
who
are
they
fooling
this
is
michelob
ultra
with
a
little
added
coloring
agent
dont
waste
your
time
or
money
however
it
is
definitley
a
step
up
from
the
regular
and
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
two
this
one
would
get
my
vote
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
nearly
inoffensive
beer
dms
and
adjust
lager
aroma
pull
this
down
from
what
might
otherwise
pass
as
a
bland
mild
the
appearance
is
a
reddish
amber
with
no
head
retention
and
like
i
said
the
aroma
well
stinks
like
cheap
beer
the
taste
has
a
caramel
note
with
pale
biscuit
undertones
this
pairing
of
real
beer
flavors
almost
makes
up
for
the
aroma
but
still
cant
qualify
it
as
good
beer
easy
enough
to
drink
and
i
wouldnt
turn
a
free
one
down
but
id
never
order
this
drinkability
not
recommended
michelob
ultra
amber
is
very
lacking
in
taste
very
light
in
body
and
very
dull
and
lifeless
overall
i
actually
like
some
of
the
michelob
specialty
brews
and
i
was
hoping
that
ultra
amber
would
be
a
decent
beer
but
unfortunately
this
is
a
light
beer
in
the
truest
sense
with
little
body
and
taste
and
little
or
nothing
in
its
composition
that
is
noteworthy
or
memorable
nonetheless
not
bad
for
a
big
american
macro
just
pour
a
few
ounces
at
a
time
into
your
glass
to
keep
ahead
of
your
consumption
i
really
didnt
enjoy
the
original
michelob
ultra
but
had
hopes
that
the
amber
would
come
with
more
flavor
the
color
was
an
improvement
over
the
original
ultra
which
i
found
odd
even
for
a
macro
no
real
smell
and
no
real
head
taste
may
actually
me
less
than
the
original
ultra
there
is
a
slight
sweetnes
to
this
that
is
not
present
in
the
original
i
can
see
the
value
of
this
for
mass
consumption
read
getting
drunk
but
still
not
as
flavorful
as
i
expected
i
tried
this
in
hopes
that
the
amberness
would
over
power
the
macroness
once
again
i
was
wrong
very
very
wrong
the
color
is
a
cross
between
yellow
and
amber
it
has
or
once
had
a
fizzy
off
white
head
the
nose
is
of
artificial
sugars
and
ricey
malts
the
taste
is
also
very
artificial
and
cloying
not
much
of
a
hop
or
malt
base
to
it
a
decent
body
is
not
too
carbonated
i
guess
i
could
drink
this
if
a
gun
was
to
my
head
ab
i
was
hoping
for
more
in
your
premium
brand
for
a
light
lager
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
granted
its
definitely
not
my
style
see
my
other
reviews
but
i
have
to
give
them
credit
for
trying
to
add
a
little
character
to
an
otherwise
bland
style
my
fiancee
had
a
few
laying
around
after
a
party
so
i
decided
to
try
it
this
brew
tastes
more
like
a
product
of
chemicals
mixed
together
than
from
fresh
ingredients
not
really
sure
why
people
buy
this
but
i
guess
to
each
their
own
the
bigger
malt
flavor
is
appreciated
this
would
be
an
o
k
choice
if
you
find
yourself
at
a
frat
party
crap
only
tried
a
bottle
of
this
so
i
could
rate
it
why
doesnt
anheuserbusch
consolidate
their
pale
lager
offerings
since
they
all
suck
stuff
is
nasty
had
a
chemical
metallic
taste
that
made
it
undrinkable
avoid
like
the
plague
if
you
are
weightconscious
you
can
do
much
better
than
this
well
where
should
i
begin
im
not
that
much
of
a
technical
reviewer
so
here
it
goes
somewhat
technical
but
not
like
some
people
ok
so
here
it
goes
this
beer
is
just
somewhat
darker
than
mich
ultra
or
budweiser
or
fill
in
the
blank
ricey
pisswater
beer
here
same
quickly
disappearing
head
as
most
macros
with
no
lacing
whatsoever
the
taste
well
is
there
any
the
taste
is
kinda
lilke
amber
bock
mixed
with
mich
ultra
to
create
a
beer
with
a
little
more
flavor
than
reguar
mich
ultra
but
not
as
much
as
amber
bock
or
mich
lager
what
can
i
say
i
bought
this
to
switch
things
up
as
in
the
realm
of
my
budget
beers
normally
i
try
to
stay
away
from
all
macros
period
favoring
paulaner
salvator
dopplebock
or
a
classic
sam
adams
boston
lager
final
verdict
on
mich
ultra
amber
this
beer
sucks
d
steer
clear
of
this
one
it
has
no
flavor
amber
colored
beer
with
quickly
fading
foam
head
aroma
and
taste
are
your
typical
corn
or
cooked
veggies
macro
that
has
been
waterd
down
to
make
it
a
light
beer
with
that
being
said
it
was
fresh
and
enjoyable
i
would
definetly
prefer
this
to
any
micro
on
a
hot
day
or
family
barbeque
it
is
just
as
advertised
a
light
low
calories
beer
almost
a
little
confused
when
i
took
notes
for
the
review
i
kinda
liked
it
but
kinda
didnt
like
it
if
thats
possible
might
try
it
this
summer
out
on
a
lawnchair
in
the
sun
for
what
it
is
worth
this
beer
really
accompished
what
it
is
inteaded
to
do
this
beer
has
a
some
what
decent
taste
to
it
of
all
the
michelob
products
i
would
have
to
say
this
one
is
the
second
most
impressive
beer
they
offer
good
job
on
offering
a
ultra
light
beer
with
some
taste
the
bottle
is
pretty
much
the
same
color
as
the
beer
w
a
cheesy
clear
decal
dont
bother
pouring
into
a
glass
but
if
you
do
hold
the
dark
amber
beer
to
the
light
and
watch
it
pass
through
like
a
glass
w
coke
and
ice
i
am
generous
with
the
taste
rating
as
if
you
compared
this
to
most
dark
beers
it
would
finish
last
in
a
contest
but
the
little
taste
of
anything
it
offers
there
is
some
malt
in
there
is
smooth
and
leaves
no
aftertaste
honestly
a
decent
choice
for
dollar
draft
night
or
if
youre
watching
the
game
and
want
a
few
its
best
aspect
is
the
very
low
cal
and
fat
content
so
if
youre
like
me
and
on
a
diet
a
couple
of
these
every
now
and
then
dont
hurt
at
all
probably
wont
buy
again
go
with
amber
bock
instead
i
havent
yet
figured
out
the
various
scores
but
given
the
way
the
percentages
are
assigned
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
the
beer
that
i
like
less
well
this
one
ends
up
being
the
winner
of
macro
smackdown
xxi
yet
another
reason
why
my
ideal
would
be
for
taste
to
be
at
least
50
mouthfeel
to
be
oh
never
mind
bottom
line
schell
light
is
the
better
beer
no
matter
what
the
final
scores
say
d
this
beer
isnt
horrible
compared
to
other
light
beers
this
is
one
i
bought
just
to
try
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
this
was
a
decent
beer
poured
a
golden
color
and
tasted
like
all
of
the
common
american
pale
lagers
out
there
a
very
bland
beer
to
some
aspect
but
if
your
looking
for
somthing
a
little
cheap
and
quick
buzz
then
this
would
be
your
best
bet
i
would
expect
better
from
anheuser
busch
but
they
did
ok
in
this
realm
drinkability
would
be
better
if
it
was
completely
flat
instead
of
fizzy
then
you
could
more
easily
chug
it
on
a
hot
day
like
the
alcoholdelivery
maltbased
beverage
that
it
is
this
is
the
beer
industrys
answer
to
craft
beer
it
looks
like
craft
beer
but
tastes
like
nothing
kind
of
like
trelanes
fireplace
that
gave
off
no
heat
that
didnt
fool
the
enterprise
crew
and
this
beer
shouldnt
fool
you
middle
of
the
road
light
beer
certainly
not
at
the
level
of
the
sa
light
but
this
amber
does
have
more
taste
than
the
regular
ultra
but
it
is
still
not
as
flavorful
as
i
was
hoping
for
would
consider
buying
again
if
i
were
slumming
i
would
spend
my
nonmoney
on
something
that
delivers
what
it
says
it
does
like
mickeys
or
pbr
if
i
wanted
a
darker
lager
then
id
go
with
honey
brown
if
you
dont
want
carbs
dont
drink
beer
i
wont
go
into
a
detailed
review
its
a
low
carb
beer
that
actually
tastes
like
a
beer
amazing
i
dont
much
like
this
beer
next
time
water
or
tea
for
me
overall
a
pretty
weak
beer
i
wont
be
drinking
many
of
these
in
the
future
typical
of
the
macro
styles
of
today
drinkability
isnt
bad
it
goes
down
like
water
hmmm
i
dont
know
what
to
think
it
really
does
taste
more
like
beer
than
most
light
beer
but
in
a
really
watered
down
way
as
opposed
to
most
light
beer
which
tastes
like
watered
down
crap
beer
so
i
gues
it
gets
a
thumbs
up
for
trying
i
have
seen
light
beers
with
better
appearence
i
mean
with
a
darker
color
smell
isnt
something
to
be
crazy
about
it
taste
different
from
the
regular
michelob
ultra
it
have
a
little
bit
of
sweetnes
in
the
flavor
like
a
far
honey
flavor
good
for
a
hot
sunday
overall
a
low
carb
beer
thats
it
maybe
a
little
flavor
thrown
in
but
thats
it
it
is
what
it
is
for
a
light
beer
this
actually
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
i
guess
if
i
was
going
to
consider
a
light
beer
i
may
choose
this
one
its
actually
tolerable
personally
i
dont
drink
light
beers
because
im
not
trying
to
watch
my
weight
and
if
i
was
i
wouldnt
be
drinking
beer
at
all
if
you
must
try
this
one
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
ambercopper
color
with
small
amounts
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
to
the
thin
head
on
top
smell
is
primarily
quite
grainy
corn
amber
malts
only
slightly
there
is
almost
no
taste
to
this
beer
a
slight
grainy
malt
taste
and
a
minute
amount
of
hops
beer
is
very
light
in
body
as
expected
and
has
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
just
because
you
can
do
something
doesnt
necessarily
mean
you
should
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
like
michelob
ultra
but
want
more
flavor
beston
draft
im
not
one
to
taste
chew
and
enjoy
light
beers
but
i
try
them
and
every
now
and
then
i
find
one
passable
this
was
not
that
beer
it
was
way
light
amber
touch
almost
water
smell
was
a
little
like
a
generic
beer
with
a
little
sharpness
from
the
slight
hops
there
really
wasnt
anything
else
mouth
beer
generic
average
went
down
like
a
beer
this
is
coors
taste
slight
hops
hint
that
this
is
an
amber
but
water
water
coors
again
while
not
totally
tasteless
i
even
have
enjoyed
nas
more
than
this
with
kaliber
being
a
good
amber
na
that
tastes
like
an
amber
beer
not
water
did
much
rather
drink
a
budweiser
not
very
good
to
drink
not
a
good
beer
too
carbonated
has
the
body
of
water
hint
of
caramel
is
quickly
destroyed
by
a
carbonation
bitter
bite
that
destroys
everything
tastes
flat
and
thin
and
in
my
opinion
stick
with
sam
adams
light
and
pay
the
extra
2
50
because
that
2
50
gets
you
a
much
better
sixpack
of
light
beer
not
overtly
horrible
because
its
so
close
to
caramel
water
but
definately
not
recommended
even
miller
lite
has
more
body
which
makes
me
wonder
how
they
got
this
color
i
tried
this
one
not
really
because
i
wanted
too
it
was
just
handed
to
me
rather
flat
tasting
no
real
flavor
just
a
little
caramelization
slight
bitter
from
that
other
than
that
no
real
flavor
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
as
good
as
the
amber
boch
offering
ab
has
but
no
where
near
as
flavorful
was
very
dissapointed
since
i
have
tried
a
few
of
the
new
seasonals
they
offer
on
draft
and
like
them
will
not
buy
this
one
one
of
the
better
light
beers
ive
had
appearance
is
a
light
amber
with
a
very
thin
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
not
much
of
a
smell
other
than
standard
swill
beer
but
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
better
kick
than
most
light
beers
a
little
grainy
but
not
that
bad
id
suggest
this
over
bud
light
and
coors
light
in
a
heartbeat
the
new
look
of
light
beer
hooray
it
still
sucks
d
only
marginally
better
than
regular
ultra
but
that
isnt
saying
much
if
the
odd
sweetness
wasnt
there
it
would
be
easier
to
drink
more
of
it
but
i
could
hardly
finish
this
one
without
gagging
if
you
must
drink
a
light
beer
try
something
else
d
wouldnt
do
it
too
much
diet
beer
is
gross
even
for
a
light
macro
this
one
is
just
a
halfhearted
attempt
at
best
to
put
some
flavor
in
an
ultra
light
that
falls
short
i
dont
need
to
lose
weight
but
even
if
i
did
i
wouldnt
drink
this
one
it
has
no
real
flavor
or
character
a
neighbor
offered
this
one
to
me
figured
i
would
give
it
a
try
glad
i
didnt
spend
money
on
it
michelob
ultra
amber
was
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
managed
to
stick
around
for
a
couple
of
minutes
the
nose
was
not
bad
but
was
extremely
light
the
taste
was
light
as
well
a
little
sweet
upfront
a
slight
twang
and
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
with
a
fairly
high
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
sucks
the
only
thing
that
it
has
going
for
it
is
the
initial
appearance
and
then
it
was
all
downhill
after
that
the
drinkability
was
rather
good
not
because
of
the
great
taste
it
just
went
down
rather
easily
thin
and
watery
no
better
than
its
ultra
brother
is
this
a
light
beer
designed
to
make
it
look
like
you
are
drinking
a
decent
beer
i
guess
that
makes
it
drinkable
to
the
ab
crowd
michelob
ultra
amber
pours
a
dark
honey
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
smells
like
adjunct
mild
in
general
very
watery
mouthfeel
some
metallic
notes
at
the
end
this
stuff
hardly
tastes
like
anything
i
think
id
rather
drink
water
not
recommended
overall
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
not
good
but
not
bad
either
overall
it
may
wake
up
michelob
ultra
drinkers
taste
buds
but
not
many
others
when
the
bartender
poured
it
into
a
12oz
mug
the
beer
was
a
clear
amber
color
with
at
least
a
1
finger
head
of
white
foam
it
was
probably
the
way
they
poured
it
but
it
was
still
very
nice
to
see
that
the
head
of
foam
had
good
retention
and
left
plenty
of
white
sticky
lace
around
the
mug
i
kept
trying
to
get
an
aroma
out
but
there
really
wasnt
anything
there
except
for
maybe
a
slight
and
i
mean
slight
aroma
of
watered
down
hops
i
was
actually
quite
surprised
by
the
taste
there
still
wasnt
much
there
but
this
beer
had
way
more
taste
than
their
regular
ultra
this
beer
had
the
taste
of
water
little
sweet
malt
and
a
light
taste
of
some
rice
and
corn
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
with
a
slight
taste
of
something
i
just
dont
know
what
it
was
it
was
probably
the
corn
and
rice
drinkability
for
me
no
if
it
was
really
cheap
and
there
was
nothing
else
there
then
maybe
im
just
glad
that
it
had
more
taste
and
color
than
regular
ultra
an
average
light
beer
they
missuse
the
amber
in
the
name
to
quite
an
extent
this
beer
would
be
pale
yellow
if
the
additional
coloring
was
not
added
try
one
of
these
just
for
the
review
ran
out
of
beer
at
dads
he
had
some
of
this
left
over
cringing
i
grabbed
on
for
the
experience
and
he
laughed
at
me
this
looked
fine
except
it
was
watery
and
the
bubbles
made
the
head
look
like
soda
it
smelled
like
a
light
lager
with
a
touch
of
extra
toasty
malt
but
it
still
had
that
stale
cooked
corn
smell
the
taste
was
sex
in
a
canoe
carbonated
water
with
a
splash
of
coloring
and
flavor
additives
you
could
drink
this
but
it
doesnt
mean
you
should
drinkability
sure
you
can
drink
this
but
why
got
this
on
sale
on
a
whim
because
i
have
a
need
to
at
least
try
everything
once
this
beer
was
made
for
yuppie
people
to
go
hey
look
at
me
im
drinking
a
dark
beer
well
woopty
do
either
this
is
watered
down
amber
bock
or
ultra
with
food
coloring
eh
as
macros
go
it
aint
to
bad
sort
of
like
budweiser
with
food
coloring
but
nothing
id
buy
again
unless
i
was
given
it
for
free
overall
a
decent
beer
to
bring
a
case
of
to
your
friends
block
party
this
summer
overall
the
best
thing
you
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
might
get
people
to
try
something
different
and
if
that
somehow
leads
them
down
the
road
to
beer
advocacy
then
thats
a
good
thing
other
than
that
though
theres
nothing
special
about
this
at
all
its
better
than
your
standard
macro
light
lager
but
not
by
a
lot
i
promise
you
my
wife
just
had
to
buy
this
tonight
what
the
heck
it
looked
actually
pretty
good
very
clear
and
crisp
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
thin
lacing
and
then
down
hill
a
little
taste
of
grassy
hops
that
made
it
difficult
to
finish
even
the
smallest
portion
after
just
making
a
pretty
good
fat
tire
amber
clone
in
my
homebrew
this
one
may
look
better
but
thats
all
im
kind
of
torn
on
this
one
its
a
low
carb
brew
that
enters
the
realm
of
something
different
than
just
beer
flavor
for
that
i
give
em
mad
props
for
atleast
trying
it
sure
its
not
some
superdeeduper
awesome
brew
or
anything
but
for
what
it
is
i
think
its
ok
its
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
which
is
what
a
very
light
beer
should
be
ofcourse
i
think
they
did
this
one
a
bit
too
conservatively
so
it
really
doesnt
have
a
chance
to
offend
anyone
overall
its
an
ok
brew
something
ill
enjoy
plenty
of
during
the
summer
months
light
amber
in
appearance
with
a
strange
orange
tinge
makes
it
look
like
liquid
rust
for
some
reason
small
bubbly
white
head
quite
a
fruitysweet
malty
aroma
not
that
bad
considering
the
source
in
taste
it
is
sweet
highly
carbonated
slight
beer
taste
very
sodalike
in
mant
aspects
reminds
me
of
the
cans
of
bass
shandy
i
used
to
get
as
a
kid
back
in
the
uk
but
that
was
0
5
this
is
5
really
light
water
filled
mouthfeel
to
be
honest
this
wasnt
quite
as
bad
as
i
expected
if
it
were
hot
outside
and
iwas
working
this
would
be
ok
drinkability
is
slightly
better
than
your
average
macro
light
but
still
has
a
ways
to
go
before
i
would
want
to
drink
more
as
far
as
macros
go
this
one
aint
half
bad
the
color
is
a
light
amber
with
just
a
hint
of
red
the
smell
is
very
slightly
spiced
the
taste
is
like
a
light
beer
but
with
a
touch
of
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
where
this
one
is
seperated
from
the
other
mass
produced
beers
there
is
no
harsh
bitterness
it
is
a
fairly
smooth
beer
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
beer
is
brewed
to
be
a
light
session
beer
and
it
certainly
is
that
i
could
session
these
all
night
final
thought
better
than
most
light
beers
so
it
is
worth
a
shot
to
all
you
yuppies
that
think
drinking
this
nonbeer
matters
in
the
calorie
count
pours
pale
amberorange
with
good
clarity
a
soapyfizzy
offwhite
head
of
threefingers
shows
very
poor
retention
and
scarcespotty
lacing
cereal
adjunct
and
light
toasted
amber
malt
nose
weak
overall
with
no
detectable
hops
the
flavor
is
similar
semisweet
cornrice
flavor
upfront
then
faint
malt
character
comes
on
and
fades
in
the
same
instant
nil
aftertaste
highly
carbonated
and
thin
bodied
turns
out
overly
crisp
but
still
not
enough
to
hide
the
offflavor
the
finish
is
mostly
clean
but
the
taste
seems
forced
and
fake
this
seems
to
be
an
attempt
to
produce
both
light
and
malty
flavor
simultaneously
and
it
ends
up
failing
to
achive
either
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
the
touch
of
sweet
increases
drinkability
over
the
regular
ultra
very
easy
to
toss
back
and
actually
enjoyable
after
a
long
day
of
laying
ceramic
tile
got
a
case
of
this
stuff
for
my
wife
i
hope
she
enjoys
it
because
there
aint
much
there
tough
sell
on
this
one
for
a
light
macro
made
beer
this
is
not
bad
pours
to
a
medium
orange
brownishgold
color
with
a
head
of
white
foam
that
did
have
staying
power
some
lacing
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
grass
and
mildly
sweet
malts
taste
was
fair
enough
traces
of
hops
dance
over
a
bland
yet
sweetened
malty
character
oddly
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
was
like
having
carbonated
water
sloshing
about
in
my
mouth
could
be
nice
on
a
wicked
hot
summer
day
but
on
a
early
spring
day
in
detroit
it
doesnt
do
much
drinkability
is
north
of
average
this
is
better
than
its
original
sister
but
not
an
amazing
beer
by
any
stretch
try
it
if
you
like
dont
expect
a
world
of
flavor
maybe
just
a
town
of
taste
stressing
for
a
macro
brew
light
beer
d
oh
yeah
im
drinking
this
again
not
i
really
dont
see
why
people
are
so
critical
of
this
beer
i
know
it
kind
of
sucks
but
for
what
it
is
and
what
its
supposed
to
be
its
not
that
bad
definitely
has
an
amber
color
to
it
with
a
glowing
white
head
and
steady
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
looks
a
little
too
fizzy
minimal
lacing
smells
somewhat
grainy
and
adjuncty
flavor
is
better
with
stronger
caramel
malty
notes
and
a
bready
texture
still
rather
thin
and
bubbly
from
the
carbonation
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
but
they
are
much
more
flavorful
than
most
light
lagers
and
this
one
still
is
quite
clean
it
has
its
place
nice
amber
color
to
it
fair
sized
white
head
with
nonstop
pearling
it
looks
pretty
good
aroma
is
a
tad
sweet
and
thin
not
much
going
on
taste
is
the
same
a
sweet
start
with
a
light
bitter
middle
and
a
dry
finish
and
yes
watery
on
the
tongue
overall
ok
nothing
i
would
buy
but
for
freeit
was
ok
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
still
a
lite
beer
though
and
id
rather
not
drink
it
but
still
it
wasnt
bad
wasnt
bad
at
all
that
something
strangely
enough
is
a
killians
all
the
things
they
could
have
made
this
taste
like
and
they
go
for
a
michelobkillians
mix
a
bit
dissapointing
really
bottom
line
just
because
its
amber
doesnt
mean
its
good
i
was
over
at
a
buddys
house
checking
out
new
kegerator
and
this
is
what
he
had
hooked
up
poured
a
pale
amber
color
slight
red
hues
thin
cap
that
dissipated
quickly
he
keeps
his
kegerator
at
38
degrees
so
the
smell
wasnt
much
but
had
a
slightly
better
than
your
basic
macro
corn
and
filler
smell
but
more
of
the
same
the
taste
was
full
of
carbonation
very
watery
not
much
sweetness
and
a
very
slight
hopiness
at
the
end
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
are
going
for
quantity
not
quality
when
you
need
to
entertain
mouthfeel
is
light
with
the
same
stingy
carbonation
that
i
mentioned
in
the
flavor
this
beer
is
just
utterly
lacking
in
any
redeeming
qualities
i
cant
even
finish
the
rest
of
my
glass
its
not
drinkable
in
the
least
i
dont
understand
why
this
even
exists
one
of
the
worst
beers
to
ever
touch
my
lips
im
not
sure
what
is
worse
the
radio
ad
campaign
or
the
beer
itself
seriously
avoid
at
all
costs
this
is
not
worth
your
time
or
money
poured
out
a
brownish
and
bubbly
amber
not
much
of
a
head
bottle
looks
kinda
kewl
wish
the
beer
inside
it
was
better
smell
is
very
light
grain
and
adjunct
taste
is
similar
to
regular
ultra
not
much
taste
at
all
it
is
a
little
smoother
and
has
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
presence
that
regular
ultra
doesnt
didnt
taste
any
hop
flavors
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
that
quickly
vanishes
this
is
drinkable
chuggable
but
its
just
not
got
any
flavor
i
wouldnt
buy
it
but
i
would
grab
it
before
a
bud
light
or
mich
ultra
reg
at
a
party
i
was
eating
potatoes
chips
with
onion
dip
so
it
didnt
taste
that
bad
after
potato
chips
better
than
a
soda
and
with
less
sugar
hanging
at
a
bar
in
weirton
what
are
you
going
to
order
to
drink
well
i
went
with
the
beer
that
at
least
i
could
get
a
review
on
even
if
its
an
ultra
low
carb
amber
appears
caramel
amber
with
a
white
frothy
head
leaves
scattered
thin
lace
aroma
is
slightly
toasted
malt
touch
of
caramel
mild
creamy
note
touch
of
generic
hop
profile
taste
is
ultra
light
on
flavor
with
a
weird
sweetness
and
clean
low
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
once
again
ultra
light
airy
with
artificial
infused
carbonation
drinkability
well
i
cant
taste
my
beer
its
alright
i
was
just
giving
it
a
shot
but
more
of
the
same
shite
from
the
big
boys
this
seltzer
water
somehow
had
a
5
abv
it
was
made
to
give
a
buzz
to
the
active
people
wo
having
to
actually
drink
anything
thank
god
it
was
a
freebie
i
cant
imagine
paying
hard
earned
cash
for
this
crap
ill
see
if
maybe
later
i
can
come
up
with
more
constructive
critiques
and
comments
once
im
back
from
the
e
r
my
fiancee
tried
this
as
well
she
indicated
that
she
needed
a
stout
to
wash
the
taste
of
this
beer
out
of
her
mouth
it
was
the
only
thing
that
the
sports
bar
offered
that
i
had
not
already
tried
i
should
have
gone
with
something
elseanything
else
the
beer
lacks
optomism
comming
straight
from
the
bottle
lightly
browned
thin
fizzy
carbonation
it
looks
like
watered
down
cola
aromas
are
faint
but
do
resemble
true
malt
caramel
and
nuts
flavors
dont
hold
the
same
promise
as
the
aroma
grainy
husky
and
vegetable
flavors
persist
without
the
malt
backbone
to
balance
or
mask
the
negative
characters
watery
from
the
very
first
sip
and
never
firms
up
finishes
thin
grain
and
husk
like
even
for
an
american
light
beer
this
is
bad
cheers
humor
is
great
but
why
do
they
think
neanderthals
are
the
only
ones
that
drink
beer
this
reminds
me
of
lowcarb
pasta
why
eat
something
that
tastes
like
utter
crap
because
you
are
trying
to
watch
you
weight
live
for
today
dont
drink
lowcarb
or
light
beer
just
another
gimmick
beer
from
ab
color
is
actually
quite
pretty
but
that
is
where
the
positives
end
nice
light
mahogany
brown
color
good
clarity
fleeting
but
substantial
head
with
a
hard
pour
but
dont
let
the
color
fool
you
there
is
little
to
no
flavor
here
as
a
homebrewer
i
can
tell
you
that
it
is
quite
easy
to
influence
the
color
of
a
beer
without
hitting
the
taste
it
would
not
take
much
more
than
a
pound
of
specially
malted
barley
to
color
a
large
batch
of
beer
homebrewers
use
these
darker
roasted
malts
in
higher
percentage
to
gain
a
roasted
or
caramel
depth
to
ales
and
lagers
while
quite
clean
tasting
i
can
barely
perceive
a
toasted
malt
character
or
breadiness
to
this
beer
wearing
a
blindfold
i
would
have
a
hard
time
distinguishing
this
from
any
light
beer
smell
is
sweet
and
slightly
alcoholic
with
a
yeasty
touch
very
little
hop
bitterness
or
aroma
looks
good
poured
in
a
glass
so
if
you
are
shooting
to
impress
someone
with
drinking
darker
beer
and
cant
stand
something
like
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
choose
this
razor
thin
body
with
sodalike
carbonation
and
a
watery
mouthfeel
gross
in
terms
of
light
beers
only
sam
adams
light
comes
to
mind
as
being
an
altogether
hands
down
better
beer
overall
this
does
have
some
taste
but
i
think
i
will
pass
on
this
for
now
on
i
am
just
a
sucker
for
trying
new
macro
shit
im
used
to
other
crap
beers
taste
so
ill
just
stick
with
that
if
i
have
too
but
i
wouldnt
knock
anyone
for
buying
this
over
mich
light
bl
ml
or
cl
overall
this
beer
should
do
ok
for
them
i
would
never
order
an
ultra
but
thisone
i
could
see
myself
ordering
if
the
choice
was
slim
and
thisone
stood
out
purchased
a
six
pack
the
other
day
out
of
couriosity
pours
a
light
amber
copper
color
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipates
no
lacing
some
faint
caramel
malt
aroma
taste
is
slightly
malty
similar
to
their
amber
bock
just
watered
down
at
least
there
is
some
taste
as
opposed
to
mich
ultra
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
at
5
abv
some
taste
and
114
calories
ab
may
have
a
winner
on
their
hands
as
far
a
light
beers
go
i
think
i
will
let
the
wife
have
the
other
5
though
i
would
like
to
thank
my
beer
guy
for
giving
me
a
case
for
free
however
even
my
guests
dont
want
them
for
free
because
the
people
who
drink
mich
ultra
typically
drink
it
because
they
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
so
they
drink
that
which
doesnt
have
much
of
a
beer
taste
at
all
the
people
who
typically
drink
amber
beers
and
others
beers
like
it
want
a
real
amber
or
dark
beer
not
fizzy
water
i
think
that
they
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
i
understand
what
they
are
trying
to
do
but
i
dont
think
that
they
did
it
very
well
again
thanks
for
the
free
beers
mr
beer
delivery
guy
but
no
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
beer
especially
the
free
kind
but
next
time
give
me
something
different
please
i
problely
wont
buy
again
this
is
a
another
attemp
to
bring
a
different
type
of
light
beer
to
the
masses
this
beer
has
a
little
more
flavor
than
most
light
beers
good
amber
color
the
carbonation
is
just
right
slight
malt
taste
but
as
usual
with
the
typical
weak
waterdown
flavor
of
a
light
beer
it
is
one
of
the
better
light
beers
out
there
but
when
you
compare
it
to
a
another
amber
light
like
sam
adams
it
falls
way
short
the
best
thing
you
can
say
about
this
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
pours
copper
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
which
fades
quick
and
leaves
no
lacing
light
caramel
malts
in
the
aroma
no
hop
profile
whatsoever
thin
is
the
understatement
of
the
year
here
the
flavors
dont
blend
well
and
its
too
weak
to
have
the
word
amber
attached
to
it
a
beer
aimed
for
the
masses
this
misses
its
mark
and
joins
the
ranks
of
other
ultra
beers
drinkability
easy
to
drink
just
like
water
still
its
not
offensive
and
id
rather
have
it
and
a
fair
amount
fewer
calories
than
a
bad
beer
with
a
lot
of
calories
but
id
rather
have
a
good
beer
no
doubt
about
it
from
a
retail
standpoint
im
sure
that
this
beer
will
sell
it
does
apeal
to
the
ultra
drinker
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
say
on
a
boat
or
in
the
sun
playing
softball
as
a
thirst
quencher
if
thats
what
was
served
but
i
wouldnt
choose
it
over
almost
any
other
options
i
like
it
its
a
good
go
to
during
the
summer
or
just
wanna
crush
through
a
few
my
wife
picked
this
up
for
herself
i
tried
one
worst
thing
ive
ever
tasted
first
sip
tasted
like
slightly
fruited
seltzer
water
then
the
fruit
went
away
quickly
and
i
was
left
with
a
tingle
as
if
i
just
drank
plain
seltzer
or
club
soda
vile
stuff
i
dont
drink
those
flavored
sparkling
waters
or
vitamin
water
etc
but
i
imagine
this
is
what
they
taste
like
i
would
have
rated
this
1
but
gave
a
little
extra
for
at
least
having
a
tiny
bit
or
fruit
aroma
barely
light
fruity
beers
are
not
for
everyone
personally
i
cant
stand
hoppy
bitter
beers
and
that
seems
to
be
the
trend
with
craft
brewers
in
the
us
i
prefer
lighter
sweeter
beers
michelobs
pomegranate
rasberry
beer
has
been
my
favorite
staple
beer
for
years
i
love
this
beer
its
light
sweet
and
refreshing
perfect
for
hot
summer
days
if
i
am
camping
or
at
a
friends
bbq
and
plan
to
be
drinking
for
hours
on
end
this
is
the
beer
i
bring
most
hard
core
beer
snobs
will
cringe
at
this
but
i
love
to
add
orange
juice
and
make
a
beermosa
with
this
beer
like
i
said
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
and
i
expect
many
to
turn
their
nose
up
at
any
beer
than
is
light
and
sweet
but
if
this
is
the
style
your
taste
buds
prefer
you
will
enjoy
it
pours
a
very
light
straw
yellow
in
color
with
a
very
small
fizzy
white
head
no
lacing
is
seen
to
mention
the
aroma
is
better
than
the
taste
and
is
of
some
sweet
fruits
the
taste
is
well
really
bad
like
drinking
a
lightly
flavored
club
soda
or
seltzer
water
way
to
much
carbonation
and
even
more
than
other
bud
products
overall
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
one
again
ookay
beer
that
was
not
too
sweet
and
would
be
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
not
overly
offensive
but
not
something
that
i
would
ever
pick
up
again
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
a
little
too
artificial
for
me
best
served
ice
cold
because
the
flavors
did
not
improve
as
this
beer
warmed
up
during
the
drinking
this
is
my
favorite
summertime
beer
my
friends
and
i
always
take
a
cooler
full
to
the
beach
i
have
had
such
a
hard
time
finding
it
this
year
i
have
heard
people
say
they
are
going
to
be
discontinuing
it
i
will
be
devastated
dont
take
our
favorite
summer
beer
away
we
love
it
out
of
all
of
the
other
beers
produced
by
the
big
3
brewers
i
like
michelob
the
best
however
this
beer
does
not
have
any
balance
the
flavors
just
do
not
work
together
at
all
it
tastes
like
they
just
added
fruit
flavorings
to
a
beer
this
is
not
something
i
would
try
again
this
is
what
it
advertises
to
be
its
very
light
and
has
a
fruity
flavor
the
carbonation
is
the
worst
part
its
even
worse
than
the
most
carbonated
soda
ill
wont
ever
be
picking
this
up
again
once
more
the
harder
that
i
poured
the
quicker
the
fizzy
bonewhite
head
seemed
to
dissipate
color
was
a
pale
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
in
evidence
nose
was
a
bit
too
perfumelike
for
my
taste
certainly
of
raspberry
but
much
too
sweet
almost
like
chemicallyengineered
esters
than
anything
natural
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
with
a
fizziness
like
pop
and
a
really
sweet
flavor
again
more
like
pop
than
beer
it
has
usually
been
my
experience
that
raspberries
impart
a
tartness
in
beer
not
the
sweetness
that
this
had
maybe
it
could
be
blamed
on
the
pomegranate
but
it
was
just
a
beer
for
people
who
really
dont
like
beer
finish
was
still
much
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
like
this
one
better
than
the
dragonfruitpeach
but
it
really
isnt
too
close
to
beer
either
these
fruitflavored
michelob
ultras
really
are
for
nonbeer
drinkers
this
is
definitely
a
mistake
i
will
not
make
again
horrible
weak
swilldont
even
think
i
can
use
this
slop
for
a
marinadealways
have
liked
mick
but
will
never
buy
it
again
very
sad
that
they
have
stooped
so
lowthis
is
just
plain
undrinkablelolpitiful
and
sad
specially
since
it
sells
for
a
premium
price
ive
learned
my
lesson
the
hard
way
overall
no
thanks
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
barely
beer
enough
to
not
be
a
wine
cooler
not
a
fruit
drink
but
not
the
first
thing
i
would
go
for
of
this
series
it
is
probably
my
least
favorite
as
well
just
like
the
ultra
dragon
fruit
peach
this
does
not
taste
like
beer
but
rather
a
fruity
soda
of
some
sort
so
if
this
is
what
you
look
for
in
a
beer
you
might
enjoy
this
pomegranate
is
a
unique
flavor
for
a
beer
which
is
why
i
gave
this
a
shot
it
has
an
extremely
light
color
and
will
not
fill
you
up
while
it
refreshes
you
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
this
was
beer
one
of
three
from
a
12
pack
sampler
at
a
friends
house
i
only
drank
half
of
each
beer
i
cant
imagine
anyone
who
actually
likes
beer
drinking
more
than
that
i
had
this
quote
in
my
notes
which
i
must
have
said
doesnt
age
aka
2
hours
on
my
deck
very
well
quite
true
it
certainly
got
worse
as
the
open
bottle
sat
around
in
the
sun
for
awhile
though
rest
assured
i
reviewed
this
under
the
optimal
conditions
of
it
being
at
its
ideal
serving
temperature
i
e
just
above
freezing
beer
is
sweet
and
thin
with
a
grainy
acidic
aftertaste
it
is
basically
soda
at
this
point
with
a
beery
late
palate
and
aftertaste
it
is
about
as
far
from
beer
as
you
can
get
in
aroma
and
taste
and
still
call
it
beer
who
is
this
marketed
to
children
we
decided
we
needed
a
liquid
to
bridge
the
gap
between
the
hops
and
stouts
of
our
tasting
this
was
the
answer
i
guess
it
doesnt
look
horrible
berlinner
weiss
sort
of
color
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
bizarrely
attractive
and
retentive
white
head
aroma
is
effed
childhood
nightmares
of
coughing
attacks
and
robitussin
return
flavor
is
less
offensive
but
were
still
trafficking
in
cough
syrup
with
a
raspberry
aftertase
um
whatevs
12
ounce
bottle
picked
up
a
single
of
this
at
liquor
barn
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
pretty
much
no
head
retention
at
all
but
theres
a
decent
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
it
smells
like
candied
pomegranates
and
raspberries
there
arent
any
beerlike
aromas
but
it
does
have
a
nice
fruity
smell
the
brew
tastes
like
slightly
watered
down
pomegranates
and
raspberries
mouthfeelbody
is
light
and
watery
it
has
moderate
carbonation
its
smooth
and
its
easy
enough
to
drink
its
an
ok
fruity
drink
but
it
seems
more
like
a
malt
beverage
than
a
beer
as
much
as
i
hate
to
say
it
i
liked
it
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
was
going
to
odno
dice
simply
not
gonna
work
here
i
like
the
two
fruits
they
chose
but
this
beer
kinda
blows
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
they
were
trying
to
dockers
im
assuming
appeal
to
the
female
maybe
i
know
plenty
of
girls
who
would
hate
this
maybe
its
their
way
of
completing
with
the
flavored
malt
beverages
out
there
either
way
this
isnt
worth
buying
its
still
the
same
boring
pale
beer
now
with
some
watered
down
added
flavors
blah
thankfully
the
last
one
of
the
night
as
they
were
just
not
good
beers
more
like
wine
coolers
then
beers
for
me
again
just
not
good
d
like
a
soda
but
less
sweet
tonic
water
with
artificial
flavoring
and
waaaay
too
much
carbonation
not
offensive
but
almost
d
this
isnt
offensive
at
least
but
it
would
be
cheaper
to
just
buy
a
bottle
of
flavored
soda
or
tonic
water
the
beer
pours
a
clear
very
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
raspberries
and
bready
malt
without
much
else
the
flavor
is
pomegranate
raspberries
corn
bread
and
water
not
only
is
the
beer
very
watery
feeling
it
tastes
like
a
glass
of
water
with
a
splash
of
fruit
juice
added
to
it
medium
carbonation
and
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
over
all
it
tastes
good
but
its
a
girly
flavored
drink
not
a
real
manly
beer
even
for
snotty
connoisseurs
more
alcoholic
juice
than
beer
its
light
tastes
and
smells
fruity
and
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
you
dont
want
to
have
too
many
or
you
will
get
sick
to
the
stomach
it
does
not
go
well
with
food
either
but
its
light
and
tastes
ok
good
for
those
who
dont
like
actual
beer
but
like
to
pretend
they
do
i
guess
d
drinkable
beer
better
than
the
other
flavors
they
came
out
with
still
this
is
not
really
beer
i
think
just
some
watered
down
raspberry
flavor
with
some
artifical
sweetness
added
to
it
my
wife
was
drinking
one
of
these
in
the
backyard
last
night
so
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
try
pretty
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
enough
white
head
this
was
the
best
feature
of
this
beer
in
fact
i
think
it
was
appropriate
for
the
style
allowing
me
to
score
it
above
3
0
if
i
so
choose
not
much
else
to
say
here
lots
of
fake
raspberry
flavor
very
sugary
almost
like
a
sickly
sweet
soda
nothing
good
going
on
here
much
better
than
the
regular
michelob
ultra
the
fruitiness
of
it
covers
the
nastiness
of
that
the
body
also
is
a
bit
different
for
a
light
beer
thought
it
was
going
to
be
too
fizzy
or
too
sweet
but
wasnt
really
wasnt
much
of
anything
but
some
mild
fruitiness
with
a
decent
smoothness
pretty
sucky
but
drinkable
fizzy
yellowy
brown
in
color
smell
is
a
mellow
blend
of
pomegranate
and
raspberry
taste
is
thankfully
not
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
the
lime
version
some
notes
of
pale
malts
drink
while
its
ice
cold
or
the
flavors
become
somewhat
medicinal
from
355
ml
bottle
no
09070bm33
sampled
on
january
10
2010
the
pour
is
a
light
yellow
color
with
upwardly
mobile
carbonation
the
white
head
is
thin
and
shortlived
the
aroma
is
too
overpowered
by
the
pomegranate
and
raspberry
addins
to
be
able
to
distinguish
anything
remotely
close
to
malts
or
hops
thin
mouthfeel
which
is
average
for
a
light
beer
but
it
also
has
this
honeylike
texture
as
well
the
taste
is
so
entrenched
in
pomegranate
and
raspberry
that
it
ends
up
coming
off
more
like
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
oh
well
i
guess
theyll
try
any
combination
once
definitely
marketed
towards
women
and
maybe
the
female
fitness
crowd
the
mouthfeel
is
as
close
to
water
as
you
can
get
without
actually
being
water
very
light
and
lightly
sweetened
with
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
which
does
make
it
kind
of
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
one
word
of
warning
however
do
not
let
this
beer
get
anywhere
near
room
temperature
or
it
gets
really
awful
if
you
do
want
to
try
it
get
it
as
cold
as
you
can
i
ended
up
giving
the
rest
of
it
to
my
mom
who
was
moderately
amused
by
it
hmm
this
was
left
at
my
place
after
a
cookout
a
few
weeks
back
im
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
but
i
wont
be
sampling
this
brew
again
anytime
soon
notes
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
it
is
pretty
much
michelob
ultra
with
just
some
kind
of
flavoring
agent
added
that
takes
what
little
flavor
it
had
to
begin
with
and
covers
it
up
completely
youd
be
better
off
with
a
raspberry
wine
cooler
i
actually
had
hopes
for
this
one
bc
i
like
pomegranate
water
and
was
thinking
it
would
taste
like
this
but
w
alcohol
dead
wrong
its
not
even
a
chick
beer
as
the
girl
i
bought
it
for
drank
twice
as
me
two
sips
to
my
one
before
dumping
it
down
the
sink
it
is
a
straw
gold
bodied
beer
that
is
thin
and
watery
and
designed
to
go
down
nice
and
easy
with
sweet
razzpom
taste
instead
it
is
a
little
sour
and
sharp
and
tastes
like
a
diet
cherry
7up
that
was
left
on
the
counter
for
awhile
this
is
really
not
palatable
at
all
bottle

pours
mostly
pale
yellow
with
very
thin
white
head
at
least
there
was
some
aroma
to
this
basically
a
water
light
beer
with
flavor
added
not
too
bad
after
18
holes
of
golf
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
much
herebut
it
was
better
than
regular
ultra
or
b
light
i
disregarded
the
fact
that
this
was
a
michelob
as
most
people
who
reviewed
it
did
not
and
thus
decided
it
was
going
to
be
bad
before
consuming
it
its
not
that
terrible
very
drinkable
but
shouldnt
be
considered
beer
a
better
version
of
michelob
ultra
but
the
bar
is
set
pretty
low
d
if
you
miss
zima
this
might
be
for
you
but
if
you
want
beer
forget
about
it
drinkability
this
beer
is
simply
stupid
i
cannot
imagine
who
would
voluntarily
purchase
this
this
is
the
most
yuppie
concoction
ever
produced
pomegranate
beer
i
have
officially
seen
it
all
i
have
never
thrown
a
six
pack
away
but
i
am
throwing
bottles
away
as
we
speak
youve
been
warned
its
really
that
bad
not
a
great
marriage
of
fruit
flavors
and
beer
especially
since
neither
are
actually
wellrepresented
here
its
not
horrible
but
its
not
impressive
either
pours
a
huge
foamy
white
head
quickly
diminishing
with
a
very
clear
pale
yellow
colored
body
very
strong
raspberry
and
cherry
pomegranate
aromas
very
enticing
some
malts
too
but
very
sweet
smelling
mmmm
cherries
very
cherry
taste
some
bitter
raspberry
and
dryness
on
the
end
somewhat
cloying
sweetness
very
fruity
tasting
but
simple
very
cherry
and
some
raspberry
refreshing
but
very
sweet
holy
chick
beer
im
really
trying
to
take
the
purpose
of
this
beer
into
consideration
when
reviewing
it
its
fruity
crap
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
and
therefore
they
should
be
drinking
a
mikes
hard
lemonade
or
rum
and
coke
nevertheless
its
a
pale
pee
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
it
looks
like
apple
juice
with
a
periodic
bubble
escaping
to
the
surface
smells
like
fruit
i
drink
a
pom
pomegranate
juice
from
time
to
time
and
i
eat
raspberries
and
i
suppose
those
odors
are
present
along
with
a
faint
faint
stink
of
lreally
light
beer
trying
to
poke
through
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
doesnt
taste
anything
like
beer
in
fact
i
pick
up
on
just
about
no
beer
qualities
whatsoever
nonexistant
malt
hops
or
anything
youd
find
in
real
beer
its
waterthin
and
very
lightly
carbonated
overall
its
closer
to
a
fruit
juice
than
a
beer
its
easy
to
drink
though
this
is
childrens
beer
if
there
ever
was
such
a
thing
theres
two
more
types
of
ultra
in
the
variety
12
pack
that
i
got
not
beer
is
this
nonalcoholic
there
is
not
an
alcohol
flavor
to
be
had
there
is
nary
a
typical
beer
flavor
also
so
it
goes
without
saying
i
would
put
this
in
plastic
bottles
and
have
them
iced
for
after
a
basketball
game
thirst
quenching
but
far
from
scratching
my
itch
for
an
actual
beer
overall
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
this
beverage
if
you
have
nothing
nice
to
say
dont
say
anything
at
all
d
i
admit
that
this
doesnt
taste
absolutely
horrible
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
beer
at
all
drinkable
how
can
you
deny
it
drinkable
as
beer
nfw
pale
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
like
the
kind
you
would
have
with
soda
aroma
is
raspberry
taste
is
fruit
dominated
by
the
raspberry
it
goes
down
easy
and
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
i
liked
it
but
its
nothing
thats
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
overall
this
stuff
sucks
no
way
about
it
please
do
not
pay
money
for
it
im
trying
someone
elses
out
of
curiosity
but
please
dont
waste
you
money
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
was
hoping
its
definitely
bad
but
ive
had
worse
nice
try
dyan
ill
have
to
see
about
getting
you
some
amnesia
ipa
and
i
do
believe
that
their
original
regular
ultra
certainly
does
have
a
place
on
the
great
beer
shelf
of
life
pours
a
extremely
pale
golden
color
a
fluffy
two
finger
tall
head
perches
itself
for
longer
than
expected
and
then
leaves
lots
of
lacingprobably
from
the
sugary
additives
this
nose
is
sweetnot
in
a
good
way
very
artificial
and
reminiscent
of
sugary
pixistixgood
when
your
an
adolescentnot
good
when
they
combine
it
with
beer
the
flavors
are
much
the
same
quite
offensive
in
my
opinionreminds
me
of
watered
down
clearly
canadian
very
thin
and
waterythough
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
acceptable
the
finish
is
of
sticky
artificial
sweetener
and
candy
corn
this
is
horrible
no
wonder
my
girlfriend
loves
it
this
is
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
and
should
be
avoided
picked
this
one
up
cause
im
a
sucker
for
novelty
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
was
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
was
short
lived
it
did
however
retain
a
pure
white
soapskim
ring
that
laced
tiny
bubbles
moderately
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
all
raspberry
extract
the
flavors
were
at
first
sweet
the
fruit
extracts
hit
me
as
decent
but
then
it
all
went
south
stale
grain
and
stale
corn
no
pomegranate
flavor
can
be
pulled
out
of
the
raspberry
syrup
that
is
stomping
all
over
it
hops
and
malt
are
quashed
too
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
and
a
little
rough
the
body
light
to
its
only
credit
it
is
crisp
but
the
aftertaste
is
unpleasant
and
metallic
so
even
thats
hard
to
enjoy
i
always
hate
to
fail
a
beer
but
this
one
deserves
it
d
nope
i
aint
drinking
any
more
d
i
somehow
managed
to
choke
this
down
i
would
never
buy
it
again
and
i
might
ask
for
my
money
back
i
honestly
didnt
hate
regular
michelob
ultra
which
isnt
great
in
its
own
regrad
but
this
is
a
wine
cooler
trying
to
be
a
beer
and
it
just
fails
miserably
not
what
i
consider
drinkable
as
soon
as
i
finished
a
bottle
i
wased
it
down
with
a
different
beer
or
some
soda
just
to
get
that
artifical
taste
out
of
my
mouth
appearance
is
of
the
fizzy
yellow
beer
vein
with
a
quickly
fleeting
head
light
specks
of
lacing
left
behind
aroma
tart
raspberries
of
the
artificial
kind
at
that
smells
like
candy
wheres
the
beer
straight
up
carbonation
in
flavor
with
a
raspberry
syrupy
flow
pretty
much
unbearable
definitely
brought
into
my
home
by
friends
fizzy
thin
cloying
mouthfeel
no
thanks
drinkability
this
is
the
worst
of
the
three
at
least
the
two
citrus
based
versions
were
refreshing
and
no
worse
than
a
chill
bud
light
lime
or
a
corona
with
a
lime
12
oz
bottle
basically
i
think
this
beer
was
made
for
12
year
old
girls
not
that
im
mad
about
that
a
friends
girl
brought
this
to
our
last
tasting
i
had
to
try
it
poured
a
transparent
yellow
fizzy
white
head
it
basically
tasted
like
fruity
gaswater
aroma
and
flavor
was
raspberry
all
artificial
very
very
light
on
the
palate
fizzy
i
guess
if
i
were
in
the
desert
and
had
to
chose
between
this
and
camel
piss
id
chose
this
maybe
drinkability
it
is
a
great
beer
for
people
who
want
to
say
they
drink
beer
but
dont
or
a
training
wheel
beer
clear
bottle
as
pictured
part
of
a
make
your
own
sixpack
from
a
local
grocery
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
body
alive
with
active
carbonation
tiny
white
head
quickly
vanishes
without
lacing
aroma
is
some
kind
of
berry
pez
candy
not
a
bad
smell
except
for
a
beverage
masquerading
as
a
beer
very
light
bodied
very
thin
actually
seltzer
water
carbonation
rules
the
palate
lightly
flavored
a
liquid
pez
candy
or
jolly
rancher
aspect
the
artificial
fruitiness
isnt
sickingly
sweet
to
its
creditbut
thats
about
the
only
thing
to
recommend
it
this
might
make
a
good
beginner
beer
for
someone
who
has
never
had
an
alcoholic
beverage
making
me
think
this
is
marketed
for
underage
drinkers
give
me
some
fruit
syrup
and
seltzer
water
and
i
could
produce
something
very
similar
in
taste
this
ultra
is
very
forgettable
a
waste
of
money
at
any
price
its
fairly
refreshing
and
not
undrinkable
but
it
aint
beer
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
any
beer
lover
i
can
see
where
some
people
who
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
would
drink
this
but
i
really
cant
believe
its
on
this
site
not
good
at
all
unless
youre
looking
for
alcoholic
fruit
punch
d
not
as
bad
as
i
anticipated
actually
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
michelob
ultra
fruity
beer
series
this
along
with
lime
cactus
and
tuscan
orange
or
apricot
or
whatever
is
much
better
than
the
regular
michelob
ultra
which
is
tasteless
imo
drinkability
their
tuscan
orange
was
acceptable
but
this
however
was
so
intensely
artificial
in
flavor
as
to
be
unpleasant
apart
from
the
lime
in
the
corona
this
is
my
first
of
the
fruit
beers
should
have
been
a
little
wary
when
all
the
girls
went
crazy
for
it
poured
about
a
halfinch
head
faded
in
15
seconds
some
lacing
that
lasted
a
bit
very
light
could
definitely
smell
the
pom
rasberry
fruits
didnt
taste
like
a
beer
at
all
rather
it
resembled
a
good
fruit
drink
gone
a
little
sour
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
but
dont
plan
on
going
with
whats
easy
in
the
future
drinkability
no
just
no
avoid
it
this
brew
is
delicious
ill
be
drinking
many
more
this
summer
its
just
as
tasty
as
other
fruit
beers
but
not
as
heavy
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
vanishes
in
a
minute
and
leaves
no
lace
clear
ugly
greenish
amber
color
strong
carbonation
and
light
bodied
sweet
raspberry
nose
flavor
is
sweet
raspberry
squeaky
clean
finish
good
session
beer
for
the
nonbeer
drinker
nothing
here
for
the
serious
beer
drinker

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capitol
convenience
concord
nh
not
recommended
though
this
was
free
at
a
recent
marathon
runners
expo
normally
the
best
tasting
beer
is
free
beer
but
that
does
not
really
apply
to
this
beer
poured
a
pale
translucent
gold
with
a
smallish
wispy
head
head
quickly
disappears
pomegranate
raspberry
highlights
the
nose
and
taste
of
this
brew
both
vying
for
your
attention
really
light
ultra
light
on
taste
mostly
just
overcarbonation
and
alcohol
is
all
you
notice
would
drink
again
if
free
but
doubtful
that
id
ever
purposely
purchase
this
one
overall
im
not
going
to
knock
this
just
because
it
is
a
lite
fruit
beer
from
michelob
as
far
as
advertising
what
it
is
and
focused
on
people
who
would
normally
buy
this
i
think
they
did
a
decent
job
though
they
say
ultra
but
it
has
over
100
calories
and
6
grams
of
carbs
sounds
more
like
a
solid
light
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
the
light
flavor
and
the
mild
fruity
sweetness
and
lack
of
bitterness
makes
this
an
easy
chugger
after
cutting
the
grass
not
one
i
would
stamp
my
approval
on
but
not
one
i
would
really
cut
down
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
its
not
undrinkable
but
its
pretty
far
from
being
good
its
more
a
beer
with
no
real
reason
for
existing
one
can
only
wonder
what
mic
was
shooting
for
here
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
clear
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
i
didnt
expect
to
love
ultra
pomegranate
raspberry
but
i
did
expect
it
to
be
drinkable
live
and
learn
according
to
one
of
their
press
releases
the
brewerys
target
is
females
ages
2149
its
hard
to
imagine
anyone
liking
this
abomination
no
matter
their
sex
age
or
degree
of
dementia
hates
them
right
back
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
similar
to
a
standard
light
lager
in
appearance
a
clear
straw
colored
beer
with
a
bubbly
white
head
the
smell
is
nothing
like
a
beer
very
sweet
and
koolaid
like
the
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
very
sweet
and
no
apparent
beer
about
it
very
fruity
actually
tastes
pretty
good
but
nothing
like
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
and
slightly
dry
finish
a
drinkable
beer
the
pool
looked
great
but
before
the
cooling
process
could
begin
i
spyed
a
lady
friend
drinking
one
of
these
and
grabbed
one
oh
yeah
pours
a
light
straw
colour
with
some
light
lacing
from
the
small
head
oh
yeah
has
some
nice
fruity
aromas
that
dont
smell
too
artificial
oh
yeah
taste
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
fruit
flavoured
mass
marketed
drink

this

pours
out
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
small

head
the
smell
is
crisp
with
lime
and
citrus
you
pick
up
on
minor
grans
in
this
brew
now
for
the
taste
it
is
lime
with
little
to
no
grains
at
the

puts
you
in
the
mind
of

up
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
some
lime
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
out
of
5
not
the
worst
brew
ive
had
but
not
the
best
there
is
not
much
to
this
brew
nice
fresh
lime
smell
almost
no
color
looks
like
a
cider
actually
kind
of
tastes
like
a
cheap
cider
overall
a
refreshing
drink
this
isnt
a
goto
top
shelf
beer
intended
for
appreciated
consumption
it
is
however
eminently
refreshing
on
hot
humid
summer
days
its
crisp
and
clean
far
superior
to
bud
light
lime
for
its
purpose
i
e
refreshment
ill
reach
for
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
its
easy
to
drink
i
feel
like
you
either
love
this
beer
or
hate
it
i
am
the
former
the
beer
is
a
wheat
yellow
type
of
color
and
is
very
carbonated
has
a
huge
head
if
you
pour
it
into
a
glass
i
personally
enjoy
the
carbonated
beer
it
has
an
intense
lime
flavor
and
imo
a
much
better
tasting
beer
than
bud
lite
lime
or
any
other
lime
beers
out
there
has
a
crisp
finish
with
little
after
taste
i
call
this
beer
a
candy
beer
among
my
friends
because
it
is
so
light
and
tasty
lots
of
you
beer
purists
will
laugh
at
me
for
even
rating
this
beer
im
not
a
purist
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
im
just
a
sucker
for
citrus
tasting
things
and
was
fortunate
to
stumble
upon
the
beer
when
i
was
in
college
thank
the
lord
that
i
did
great
beer
to
drink
during
the
warm
months
of
the
year
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
citrus
tasting
beer
cheers
pours
clear
goldenyellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
at
all
as
well
as
no
lacing
lots
of
bubbles
due
to
high
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
grains
and
lime
the
taste
is
the
same
but
on
the
watereddown
side
as
would
be
excepted
actually
goes
down
easy
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
i
liked
this
one
better
than
the
regular
mick
ultra
i
had
several
months
ago
probably
good
for
a
hot
summers
day
o
if
you
are
going
to
consume
a
product
that
is
this
fake
and
synthesized
i
feel
like
you
should
just
go
with
a
malt
beverage
obud
light
lime
was
better
but
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
me
knowing
this
beer
did
not
use
real
limes
to
flavor
it
o
a
horrible
beer
do
not
recommend
at
all
to
me
this
is
the
worst
beverage
i
ever
drank
michelob
ultra
lime
cactus
2
55
anheuserbusch
in
saint
louis
mo
i
need
this
on
the
shelves
in
my
area
pleased
customer
o
this
is
different
than
most
lime
beers
namely
bud
light
lime
i
suppose
its
that
cactus
edge
giving
it
some
extra
agave
nectar
sweetness
i
understand
that
most
beers
have
a
purpose
even
crappy
or
fruited
ones
i
just
cant
imagine
anyone
buying
this
for
enjoyment
its
just
not
that
good
weve
found
the
michelob
ultra
lime
cactus
to
be
an
outstanding
beer
and
love
the
refreshing
taste
and
the
after
taste
the
only
beer
that
has
come
close
to
it
was
the
shiner
bock
lime
cactus
that
was
a
limited
production
beer
it
did
not
compare
to
this
to
the
michelob
and
its
all
we
drink
now
o
this
one
is
not
for
me
maybe
i
do
not
like
the
lime
syrup
with
cactus
combined
with
super
light
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
i
would
call
this
enjoyable
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
it
is
sweet
with
lime
juice
but
there
is
a
clean
crisp
adjunct
hop
note
at
the
end
so
that
is
around
average
overall
well
not
really
my
kind
of
brew
i
guess
if
you
feel
like
a
diet
soda
with
vodka
you
may
like
this
but
then
again
why
even
bother
o
overall
this
was
a
nice
little
flavored
adjunct
that
would
do
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
id
have
another
in
the
specified
situation
or
at
a
party
poured
form
a
12
oz
can
into
a
pint
tulip
glass
this
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
are
of
sugar
lime
sort
of
a
soda
smell
the
feel
is
light
the
taste
is
more
tasteless
than
i
expected
mostly
taste
of
water
with
hints
of
lime
and
sugar
you
dont
drink
this
one
for
flavor
it
is
what
it
is
its
too
sweet
for
me
but
ultimately
it
achieves
what
it
set
out
to
achieve
a
fruity
light
lager
that
you
can
pound
my
quick
pour
resulted
in
a
finger
of
fizzy
foaming
popping
bonewhite
head
with
almost
instantaneous
dissipation
i
would
have
a
tough
time
defending
this
one
of
i
were
ever
called
before
greg
koch
color
was
a
pale
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
in
evidence
nose
smelled
of
lime
and
something
peppery
is
this
what
the
cactus
was
supposed
to
impart
or
was
this
some
sort
of
marketing
scheme
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
with
a
really
watereddown
lime
taste
on
the
tongue
i
have
had
better
limeade
in
fact
i
had
a
mikes
classic
margarita
yesterday
and
while
it
may
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
it
was
more
interesting
than
this
finish
had
such
a
light
taste
of
lime
that
i
wondered
why
they
even
bothered
this
needed
more
ooomph
to
distinguish
it
from
regular
michultra
again
what
was
the
cactus
supposed
to
have
brough
to
the
party
i
feel
like
i
missed
something
rjt
o
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
lime
and
cactus
actually
work
kind
of
well
together
but
still
not
very
good
it
has
the
lime
with
a
hint
of
salt
finish
like
a
margarita
but
without
the
hard
liquor
sugar
and
calories
try
it
youll
love
it
as
well
as
your
nonbeer
drinker
friends
it
can
be
your
gateway
beer
for
them
this
is
the
first
lime
beer
that
didnt
remind
me
trix
cereal
as
the
flavor
was
pretty
much
pure
lime
maybe
im
not
too
familiar
with
cactus
but
im
pretty
sure
there
was
no
cactus
flavor
here
this
one
might
the
most
enjoyable
of
the
3
beers
in
the
pack
the
others
being
dragonfruitpeach
and
pomegranateraspberry
but
it
still
is
pretty
much
a
nonbeer
drinkers
beer
i
can
see
this
being
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
if
nothing
else
was
available
i
was
thinking
this
was
going
to
be
worse
than
expected
but
its
what
the
label
says
minus
cactus
needles
stuck
in
your
face
a
sprite
dumbed
down
beer
like
that
it
doesnt
have
much
calories
probably
a
brainless
summer
cheap
quencher
harmless
just
not
that
fun
this
beer
is
definitely
a
little
better
with
the
addition
of
salt
around
the
mouth
other
than
a
cheap
summer
beer
this
isnt
very
good
served
from
bottle
into
a
shaker
poured
straw
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
lime
water
and
floral
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
lime
water
and
floral
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
not
that
good
of
a
brew
with
that
said
this
is
much
better
than
the
regular
mich
ultra
though
as
it
has
more
flavor
i
could
see
the
girls
pounding
these
at
a
frat
party
in
college
i
would
drink
again
but
only
for
the
same
reason
i
did
this
time
to
sober
up
taste
shows
some
margarita
mix
with
a
light
lager
and
a
shitload
of
fizz
not
altogether
bad
but
it
is
very
unbeerlike
i
actually
dont
mind
a
bud
light
lime
every
now
and
again
so
compared
to
that
michelob
ultra
lime
cactus
is
actually
not
half
bad
its
definitely
sweeter
more
carbonated
and
less
beery
i
can
easily
finish
this
12
oz
sample
but
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
buy
it
im
gonna
consider
this
research
of
sorts
for
an
upcoming
cactusbased
desert
beer
it
pours
a
clear
lightlypale
straw
topped
bya
shortlived
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
fake
sugary
lime
wheat
and
watereddown
lemonade
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
somehow
the
sweetness
is
both
increased
and
helpful
its
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
body
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
suprisingly
decent
brew
one
that
wallows
in
artificiality
but
abstains
from
taking
it
too
far
going
into
real
swill
territory
im
not
sure
how
to
feel
right
now
overall
this
beer
is
way
too
limey
for
me
theres
nothing
to
the
beer
other
than
lime
but
it
is
definitely
better
than
plain
michelob
ultra
for
sure
overall
no
thank
you
unless
i
ran
out
of
beer
on
a
canoe
trip
or
on
the
4th
of
july
the
mouthfeel
was
not
overly
carbonated
and
it
was
very
light
bodied
overall
this
one
is
not
offensive
especially
on
a
hot
day
however
it
moreso
tastes
like
lime
soda
than
beer
to
its
credit
it
does
not
have
some
of
the
nasty
chemical
taste
that
other
lime
beers
have
though
there
is
only
an
inkling
that
lets
you
know
heythis
is
beer
i
find
i
would
drink
this
after
a
really
dry
beer
but
would
otherwise
pass
i
did
try
to
grade
this
to
style
and
in
comparison
to
most
in
the
style
it
is
drinkable
this
beer
sucks
dont
buy
it
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
disappeared
it
smells
of
flowers
and
lime
sherbet
it
tastes
of
lime
sherbet
too
thats
about
it
its
a
lime
sherbet
beer
its
very
carbonated
and
light
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
beer
isnt
bad
lots
of
flavor
almost
like
a
key
lime
pie
definitely
a
gimmick
but
hey
it
tastes
pretty
good
pours
a
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
some
carbonation
little
fizzy
white
head
which
did
leave
some
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
has
a
nice
scent
of
lime
grain
and
kinda
ricy
the
taste
is
pretty
cool
citrus
but
also
grainyricy
light
body
tastes
pretty
good
on
a
hot
day
but
would
not
really
seek
out
again
o
only
reason
i
rated
it
this
high
is
because
it
did
go
pretty
well
with
some
lime
flavored
chicken
wings
into
a
pint
glass
this
ones
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
no
carbonation
streams
tiny
joke
of
a
thin
white
head
fades
faster
than
you
can
say
chick
beer
surprisingly
it
retains
a
thin
ring
and
some
lacing
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
smells
of
seltzer
water
with
a
lime
twist
tastes
of
watered
down
lime
punch
artificial
flavor
kind
of
like
a
couple
of
lime
jolly
ranchers
dissolved
in
a
glass
of
water
i
think
im
sensing
a
theme
here
faint
astringent
note
with
a
slightly
dry
mildly
alcoholic
finish
of
the
three
flavored
mich
ultras
i
tried
the
lime
cactus
was
the
only
one
that
had
any
kind
of
alcohol
flavor
whatsoever
mouth
is
fizzy
and
wet
and
wholly
underwhelming
overall
its
inoffensive
not
overly
sweet
and
quenching
its
the
least
offensive
of
the
4flavor
mich
ultra
multipack
mich
ultra
cactus
lime
is
a
perfect
hot
summer
lawn
mower
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
but
it
is
not
a
beer
for
beer
snobs
the
attempt
by
mich
ultra
to
hit
the
corona
lime
is
quite
nice
the
color
is
clear
golden
with
good
carbonation
not
much
head
the
smell
is
limesyrup
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
lime
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
perfect
for
hot
days
like
at
disney
world
for
example
another
cheap
beer
provided
by
my
broinlaw
poured
into
a
glass
pours
a
pale
gold
no
head
scents
of
lime
lemon
rice
mouth
is
sharp
with
good
carbonation
easy
gulper
flavor
isnt
too
bad
i
like
the
lime
characteristic
but
the
rest
of
it
is
just
plain
weak
cheap
grains
like
rice
and
corn
make
up
the
most
of
it
the
lime
addition
steps
this
one
just
a
cut
above
the
regular
ultra
but
this
is
still
something
id
avoid
in
the
future
just
want
to
start
off
by
saying
that
cactus
just
sounds
really
interesting
as
a
beer
additive
however
lime
not
so
much
this
brew
is
probably
the
best
out
of
the
three
in
the
series
the
look
of
the
beer
is
very
light
and
has
almost
no
head
the
smell
is
of
lime
mostly
not
much
of
anything
else
happening
here
the
taste
is
light
flavored
with
lime
not
really
sure
what
cactus
tastes
like
so
its
hard
to
pick
up
on
that
the
beer
itself
isnt
really
all
that
great
i
might
try
this
one
again
if
it
was
free
drinkability
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
at
all
complex
or
interesting
easy
to
drink
in
the
morning
after
a
bad
hangover
what
were
they
thinking
8th
grade
promotion
for
a
girl
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
an
extreamly
pale
yellow
color
with
virtually
no
head
smell
is
of
sweet
limes
taste
is
rather
mild
some
sour
limes
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
overall
one
of
the
worst
i
have
ever
had
i
am
sorry
to
have
been
a
part
of
this
one
d
the
lime
flavor
keeps
this
from
total
failure
but
it
is
watery
and
fizzy
would
be
easy
to
drink
but
effervescents
and
artificial
flavors
makes
me
queezy
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
rather
large
head
actually
bought
it
because
its
past
its
drink
by
age
and
was
only
ten
bucks
for
a
case
you
can
taste
primarily
just
lime
and
i
have
no
clue
what
cactus
tastes
like
but
this
is
what
id
imagine
it
to
taste
like
it
is
super
easy
to
drink
at
4
0
alcohol
and
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
after
a
long
day
at
work
or
a
long
workout
or
a
pickup
game
of
football
basketball
or
baseball
its
by
far
the
best
ultra
light
style
beer
ive
had
overall
really
is
this
beer
my
fiance
bought
it
so
i
drank
one
but
never
again
pours
a
pretty
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
lime
and
light
beer
like
sweetness
and
only
the
faintest
hop
aroma
tastes
very
sweet
with
hints
of
citrus
lime
a
little
faint
hops
in
there
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
drinkability
is
not
the
best
d
i
guess
it
serves
its
purpose
as
chick
beer
because
i
cant
find
a
single
beer
element
in
this
beverage
its
like
they
took
bud
light
lime
and
added
50
water
to
it
d
not
the
best
beer
but
i
like
it
d
as
awful
as
it
might
be
to
some
people
to
sayadmit
this
wasnt
really
all
that
bad
i
dont
know
how
often
id
want
to
drink
this
but
it
tasted
pretty
decent
drinkability
if
im
looking
for
something
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
the
lake
it
may
or
may
not
include
a
lime
but
if
i
wanted
a
lime
beer
this
one
wouldnt
be
the
one
way
too
light
watery
and
not
enough
lime
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
lime
with
a
little
salt
it
smells
like
a
margarita
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
lime
with
a
tad
bit
of
sweetness
light
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
terrible
but
not
something
i
wish
to
try
again
d
i
was
kind
of
thirsty
and
just
looking
for
something
to
throwback
quickly
i
grabbed
this
out
of
the
fridge
and
it
did
the
trick
as
far
as
american
light
lagers
go
this
one
is
more
than
bearable
and
pleasantly
drinkable
a
good
picnic
beer
that
you
dont
have
to
feel
bad
about
drinking
straight
from
the
bottle
i
honestly
believe
this
is
the
best
of
the
with
lime
beers
out
there
ab
thank
you
for
actually
doing
something
right
d
this
beer
is
well
drinkable
i
dont
care
for
the
flavor
of
it
but
the
low
abv
and
the
lack
of
any
real
flavor
gives
it
amazing
drinkability
oh
michelob
you
make
me
smile
once
again
with
your
mastermind
d
look
the
abv
is
low
and
you
can
drink
it
it
is
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
drank
drank
directly
from
the
bottle
bright
yellow
color
very
crisp
lime
flavor
and
some
other
sweet
flavors
also
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
spring
day
much
better
choice
than
bud
lime
or
even
corona
this
beer
is
pairing
nicely
with
some
homeade
buffalo
chicken
and
greek
salad
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
very
easy
it
was
pretty
crisp
and
was
not
very
flavorful
the
lime
just
points
out
and
lets
itself
be
known
but
beyond
that
here
really
isnt
a
lot
to
speak
of
fizzy
neon
yellowy
green
in
color
smell
is
of
lime
juice
and
sugar
taste
is
a
horrible
cloying
punch
of
sugary
limeade
no
notes
of
beer
at
all
except
the
carbonation
i
can
barely
finnish
this
guy
and
as
it
warms
it
tastes
worse
and
worse
this
is
pretty
much
limeade
with
a
touch
of
unnoticable
alcohol
thin
light
highly
carbonated
it
as
close
as
beer
gets
to
drinking
air
you
just
burned
a
couple
thousand
calories
on
the
bike
why
put
them
back
on
with
a
surly
stout
or
pretentious
porter
this
beer
is
neither
michelob
makes
honest
quality
beers
for
hard
working
americans
the
ultra
lime
cactus
is
definitely
their
pinnacle
brew
a
true
epiphany
in
a
bottle
even
tastier
than
the
pom
wheat
keeping
with
the
theme
of
simplicity
and
american
pride
the
bottle
is
twistoff
which
makes
it
even
easier
to
quaff

which

no
detail
is
ignored
step
back
and
take
a
good
look
from
the
light
blocking
clear
bottles
to
the
neuvoamericano
label
design
the
true
treasure
is
all
around
not
just
in
the
brew
the
ultra
lime
cactus
or
ulc
as
i
call
it
is
an
experience
not
to
be
rushed
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
faint
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
crisp
lime
aroma
its
light
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
has
a
light
and
watery
pilsner
malt
and
adjunct
flavor
thats
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
lime
character
its
easily
quaffable
on
a
hot
day
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
typical
light
lager
with
a
nice
lime
taste
this
would
be
a
fine
choice
in
the
hot
weather
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
down
to
nothing
smells
ok
sort
of
like
a
lime
girly
lotion
or
something
definitely
not
like
a
beer
still
not
an
awful
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
lime
thats
about
it
sort
of
like
drinking
lime
water
without
the
bitter
lime
citrus
bite
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
you
could
drink
these
pretty
much
all
day
long
absolutely
avoid
this
like
the
plague
it
reminds
me
that
fruit
beers
can
be
horrible
if
poorly
done
and
its
an
example
of
that
overall
well
i
can
say
id
buy
it
for
a
frat
party
or
a
softball
game
or
something
where
lots
of
distractions
would
keep
me
from
enjoying
a
good
beer
and
where
other
people
may
enjoy
a
new
flavor
wont
be
found
in
my
beerhumidor
though
save
your
for
something
else
i
got
a
12
pack
of
three
different
types
of
this
childrens
beer
this
is
the
second
one
i
am
trying
this
ultra
variety
has
no
head
whatsoever
it
looks
like
apple
juice
with
some
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
every
once
in
a
while
it
smells
like
a
margarita
it
smells
good
but
absolutely
nothing
like
a
beer
i
swear
to
god
water
with
a
lemon
wedge
has
as
much
flavor
as
this
this
beer
is
as
thin
as
water
and
tastes
almost
the
same
there
is
nothing
about
this
beverage
that
resembles
beer
nothing
its
a
fruit
juice
lime
juice
a
girl
who
doesnt
like
beer
would
be
better
off
with
a
mixed
drink
or
a
woodchuck
cider
or
something
i
cant
see
how
this
would
appeal
to
anybody
a
true
american
embarassment
i
hope
no
germans
ever
drink
this
beverage
got
this
on
beer
friday
at
work
does
have
a
nice
brilliant
gold
color
though
little
head
appears
on
top
of
it
sweet
lightly
limeish
aroma
the
taste
doesnt
resemble
beer
at
alla
candy
sweetness
with
a
faint
lime
tartness
still
it
doesnt
taste
bad
per
se
its
like
a
light
limey
soda
not
worth
trying
again
but
not
wretched
either
light
bodied
really
and
easy
to
drink
could
give
lime
flavored
seltzer
a
run
for
its
money
this
is
drinkable
as
it
tastes
like
water
but
i
cant
call
this
beer
and
i
do
believe
that
their
original
regular
ultra
certainly
does
have
a
place
on
the
great
beer
shelf
of
life
yes
i
know
its
a
pilsner
but
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
watery
and
thin
and
gross
after
i
finish
enough
to
review
it

you
remember
a
decade
back
when
clear
food
products
were
in
there
was
even
the
illfated
and
pretty
horrible
miller
clear
well
or
too
salty
like
miller
chill
nope
but
by
no
means
it
is
beer
and
rather
shitty
at
that
overall
this
beer
is
for
yardwork
fishing
or
heavy
session
drinking
with
that
said
it
aint
bad
for
those
events
my
favorite
light
macro
doesnt
say
a
lot
awfullly
bland
no
taste
at
all
might
as
well
drink
carbonated
water
this
is
really
not
that
bad
it
tastes
like
water
but
i
dont
mind
that
sometimes
i
just
need
a
beer
that
doesnt
have
a
strong
flavor
i
like
the
bottle
design
too
this
is
overall
not
a
bad
choice
definitely
better
than
bud
light
my
go
to
beer
when
looking
for
low
carbs
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
gets
knocked
all
the
time
if
you
want
a
low
carblight
beer
with
a
decent
taste
and
a
higher
than
3
volume
this
is
it
not
as
bad
as
some
of
these
reviews
would
indicate
im
not
a
abi
or
millercoors
fan
at
all
but
when
im
at
someones
house
for
a
barbecue
and
its
hot
and
humid
as
hell
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
time
and
place
i
suppose
this
is
the
beer
i
go
to
when
i
just
want
to
get
a
cold
refreshing
buzz
without
the
bitterness
of
full
flavor
beer
or
the
alcohol
kick
of
liquor
not
much
going
for
it
in
terms
of
character
i
drink
carbonated
water
daily
and
this
simply
feels
like
a
hoppy
alcoholic
version
of
that
i
would
say
that
its
deceptively
strong
for
its
watered
down
taste
i
am
a
fan
of
domestic
light
beer
and
this
is
my
goto
the
bros
insist
waitresses
card
me
when
i
order
claiming
you
cant
order
ultra
unless
you
are
under
21
but
i
cant
help
myself
this
is
what
i
like
i
can
drink
these
all
night
with
no
damage
if
you
like
flavor
or
a
buzz
stay
away
this
aint
that
brew
this
is
for
guys
like
me
who
harvest
flavor
from
the
enchiladas
and
seek
refreshment
from
my
brew
unbiased
this
was
honestly
the
worst
experience
i
have
ever
had
drinking
beer
in
my
life
id
rather
pour
this
down
the
drain
than
finish
one
probably
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
pours
a
near
translucent
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
the
scent
had
a
bit
of
rice
on
it
but
nothing
much
the
taste
was
terribly
mild
with
only
some
rice
in
the
beginning
not
a
fan
might
be
the
worst
beer
to
date
no
taste
better
off
drinking
a
glass
of
water
awful
beer
cheap
price
cheap
taste
my
mom
drinks
this
swill
no
thanks
super
light
but
clean
perfect
for
a
hot
day
on
the
golf
course
watered
down
bud
light
is
the
taste
of
this
urine
my
favorite
light
domestic
beer
horrible
thanks
but
no
thanks
overall
i
like
the
taste
andcontent
seems
to
be
a
bit
pricy
to
have
around
for
a
regular
beer
great
light
beer
to
enjoy
without
the
calories
smooth
with
lower
alcohol
content
than
other
beers
just
a
good
beer
to
have
onhand
i
can
actually
enjoy
a
bud
light
or
miller
lite
and
i
do
more
often
then
most
on
this
website
im
sure
was
left
10
from
18
pack
i
got
from
are
room
neighbor
while
on
vacation
at
the
beach
we
ran
outa
bud
and
started
on
these
this
has
got
to
be
the
worst
beer
in
ever
tasted
when
people
say
that
bud
or
miller
light
have
no
taste
i
roll
my
eyes
a
little
because
they
maintain
some
kind
of
beer
flavor
this
stuff
is
pure
water
no
sweetness
no
bitterness
nothing
i
tasted
more
from
the
side
of
can
which
makes
it
even
more
nasty
since
it
makes
this
water
taste
like
metal
worst
beer
in
ever
had
most
watered
down
beer
ive
ever
had
looks
great
but
not
a
lot
of
taste
very
watery
but
very
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
very
clean
and
refersing
very
light
no
taste
at
all
i
dont
understand
why
they
still
make
this
this
is
what
you
drink
when
youve
been
drinking
so
much
beer
that
your
belly
is
starting
to
show
it
its
also
relatively
inexpensive
its
not
fantastic
youre
not
going
to
sing
alabanzas
but
its
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
but
no
head
whatsoever
and
very
light
carbonation
smells
like
every
other
adjunct
lager
a
lot
of
carbonation
going
down
and
more
flavor
than
most
like
beers
so
far
my
second
favorite
light
lager
after
busch
light
if
i
had
to
choice
favorite
using
the
term
lightly
that
is
not
very
bad
not
very
good
very
light
with
a
faint
taste
ice
cold
not
bad
tastes
sweet
i
was
in
disney
world
everythings
better
there
enjoy
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favourite
beers
when
i
didnt
like
the
bitterness
i
went
back
to
taste
it
again
well
definitely
is
not
something
precious
but
i
dont
think
that
is
so
bad
as
the
scores
here
it
might
just
be
for
different
kind
of
drinkers
yes
its
actually
too
soft
and
almost
like
drinking
water
but
there
are
some
people
who
like
this
kind
of
beer
so
if
you
like
it
go
for
it
wow
this
place
is
loaded
with
snobs
beer
enthusiasts
are
getting
bad
raps
because
of
haters
that
crap
on
everything
that
isnt
100
ibus
beer
is
beer
folks
are
getting
snobbier
than
the
wineos
at
my
restaurant
its
a
cheap
clean
beer
meant
to
be
drank
out
of
a
can
on
the
golf
course
around
a
fire
or
just
when
you
dont
feel
like
sinking
1216
bucks
on
a
six
pack
it
is
what
it
is
beer
snobs
i
am
not
sure
why
people
dislike
it
so
much
for
20
bottles
it
was
12
great
buy
it
is
a
great
beer
to
relax
and
drink
with
it
does
the
trick
but
it
has
decent
quality
and
taste
when
you
compare
it
to
other
light
beers
in
the
same
price
range
it
has
a
sweet
taste
that
doesnt
linger
look
i
love
beer
so
if
im
offered
one
i
will
probably
take
it
but
i
would
buy
natural
ice
before
i
bought
this
stuff
hey
at
least
nattie
ice
will
give
you
a
buzz
with
the
5
9
abv
i
once
drank
30
mich
ultras
during
a
canoe
trip
and
wasnt
even
drunk
at
the
end
if
you
want
to
have
something
in
your
hand
but
dont
want
taste
or
to
get
drunk
this
is
the
beer
for
you
tastes
fine
gets
you
drunk
before
filling
you
up
also
maybe
i
want
to
watch
my
weight
bunch
of
animals
on
here
an
outstanding
beer
as
long
as
you
want
something
thats
a
notch
above
swill
and
arent
really
for
any
true
beer
taste
or
smell
experience
highly
recommended
for
those
who
cant
stand
the
idea
of
drinking
anything
with

beer
for
those
watching
their

for
those
of
us
who
want
to
taste
their
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
steer
clear
of
this
sorry
excuse
for
a
beer
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
if
this
didnt
exist
this
sucks
impressive
they
managed
to
get
so
little
flavour
in
this
even
within
the
context
of
comparing
light
beers
which
collectively
tend
to
be
awful
this
one
is
just
plain
nasty
no
flavor
whatsoever
this
embarrassing
to
say
i
even
drank
one
at
one
time
why
would
anyone
take
time
to
seriously
review
this
brew
wow
pretty
awful
no
flavor
basically
just
drinking
water
with
a
tad
bid
of
alcohol
overall
i
tried
it
now
i
know
probably
wont
drink
again
unless
i
get
it
free
somewhere
overall
im
usually
a
bit
of
a
snob
but
for
a
light
beer
this
one
has
some
character
its
not
offensive
and
even
though
coors
light
and
miller
lite
taste
better
this
is
better
than
bud
light
by
a
mile
give
it
a
fair
shot
you
might
even
like
it
overall
this
beer
tries
so
hard
to
be
so
light
that
it
loses
the
plot
pass
if
pooft
was
a
beer
style
this
would
be
the
beer
that
epitomized
the
style
i
could
have
sworn
i
was
drinkiing
something
akin
to
kiwi
or
grape
seltzer
water
not
sure
why
i
was
getting
fruity
smells
and
tastes
from
this
beer
but
i
was
i
guess
if
you
technically
stretch
the
definition
of
beer
far
enough
it
could
conceivably
be
possible
to
include
this
beverage
but
im
not
sure
why
youd
want
to
should
be
marketed
as
some
sort
of
wine
cooler
thing
because
beer
it
really
aint
this
beer
is
proof
that
if
you
spend
enough
time
building
a
brand
people
will
buy
almost
anything
lucky
for
me
this
can
was
a
freebie
which
i
attempted
to
consume
for
the
purposes
of
doing
a
review
i
finished
slightly
more
than
half
i
thought
that
was
doing
pretty
good
this
beer
gets
a
general
shrug
from
me
the
only
reason
i
might
pick
it
up
would
be
if
i
was
counting
my
calories
and
was
too
lazy
to
go
running
to
burn
off
my
beer
intake
im
diabetic
with
high
triglycerides
not
supposed
to
drink
beer
or
whiskey
on
both
counts
from
more
healthy
days
way
back
my
top
three
beers
were
warsteiner
becks
and
michelob
light
im
not
supposed
to
drink
any
beer
but
i
sneak
one
every
month
or
so
so
far
the
only
beer
that
doesnt
impact
my
physical
conditions
on
a
one
beer
serving
only
basis
is
michelob
ultra
admittedly
it
doesnt
have
the
qualities
of
a
warsteiner
or
a
becks
which
would
now
yield
me
alley
oop
ankles
on
one
serving
but
it
does
compare
favorably
for
me
to
michelob
light
my
favorite
american
beer
ultra
is
not
one
of
my
top
three
beers
but
if
i
want
to
avoid
painful
swelling
in
my
ankles
lower
legs
while
enjoying
a
single
beer
a
month
it
is
my
only
beer
and
i
am
truly
grateful
for
it
it
is
enjoyable
and
thats
what
its
now
all
about
for
me
o
i
hadnt
had
a
michelob
ultra
in
a
long
time
and
now
i
remember
why
i
did
some
investigation
among
the
party
guests
who
were
drinking
a
fair
amount
of
the
stuff
and
got
the
typical
i
dont
like
the
stuff
you
drink
answer
oh
well
to
each
his
own
well
its
better
than
michelob
light
i
understand
the
effort
to
make
light
beer
for
those
trying
to
watch
carbs
or
calories
but
if
this
is
what
you
have
to
resort
to
you
should
just
quit
beer
all
together
i
dont
review
beers
too
often
but
somehow
i
came
across
this
on
ba
and
memories
of
drinking
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
were
conjured
up
it
was
a
few
years
ago
when
this
beer
was
released
a
few
friends
of
mine
gathered
at
a
local
pub
the
michelob
girls
showed
up
with
free
shirts
and
beer
in
buckets
full
of
ice
they
gave
us
all
free
bottles
to
try
and
the
funny
thing
is
after
tasting
the
michelob
ultra
we
all
ended
up
tossing
the
free
michelob
and
buying
our
own
real
beer
avoid
this
if
you
enjoy
beer
with
substance
flavor
and
soul
after
lengthy
test
of
human
endurance
man
prefers
to
be
rewarded
with
this
magnificent
brew
cans
are
the
prefered
container
due
to
their
low
weight
for
packing
on
a
cycling
sailing
or
skiing
adventure
the
slender
size
makes
the
cans
perfect
for
packing
into
ones
jeans
optimally
cans
can
be
inserted
through
the
front
zipper
stashed
in
the
jeans
above
the
ski
boots
the
cans
are
often
purchased
by
the
30
as
they
are
assorted
into
a
beautiful
suitcase
in
ones
hands
delicate
fingers
wrap
effortlessly
to
ensure
a
tight
grip
the
feeling
of
holding
a
slender
tall
yet
athletic
can
can
only
be
compared
to
the
exhilarating
feel
of
yachting
on
the
mediterranean
after
a
grueling
cycle
through
the
dolomites
the
taste
is
world
renowned
some
have
compared
the
taste
to
that
of
a
very
young
yet
well
fed
flamingo
oh
how
delicious
they
are
after
consumption
the
body
feels
a
great
pleasure
which
has
no
equal
the
smell
brings
ill
prepared
man
to
his
knees
for
it
is
unrivaled
as
the
beer
slides
down
a
mans
throat
he
oft
not
forget
how
powerful
each
day
he
breathes
earths
air
can
be
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
i
enjoyed
my
bottle
for
what
it
was
and
it
did
help
pouring
in
the
glass
instead
of
drinking
from
a
bottle
as
is
typically
done
with
this
style
a
low
carbohydrate
beer
regarded
by
yuppies
as
a
reward
has
a
very
pale
yellow
appearance
which
culminates
in
a
flavor
profile
of
some
light
malt
meets
corn
and
a
slightly
watery
note
of
virtually
no
hops
to
balance
out
the
water
flavor
tastes
to
me
like
seltzer
water
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
michelob
light
itself
no
beer
of
character
with
the
slightest
hint
of
a
floral
grain
note
id
much
rather
drink
a
sip
of
a
real
lager
beer
or
ale
which
is
decent
than
this
horrid
swill
if
i
had
to
watch
carbs
and
calories
to
me
this
is
punishment
not
a
reward
after
a
hard
workout
i
regard
this
as
a
beer
insult
even
to
low
end
bmc
swill
so
you
have
a
low
rating
for
many
of
us
this
would
take
a
dozen
to
not
make
you
want
more
so
horrid
value
for
the
money
so
please
look
elsewhere
for
a
light
lager
and
drink
fewer
and
be
happier
ultra
swill
i
call
this
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
if
you
have
the
money
pours
a
clear
super
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
watery
with
some
malt
grain
corn
and
vegetal
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
watery
and
bland
sweet
grain
corn
and
vegetal
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
horrible
beer
that
is
barely
drinkable
with
its
sweet
and
vegetal
aromas
and
flavors
pours
a
strawyellow
like
cider
with
a
very
small
white
fizzy
head
that
doesnt
last
long
some
very
light
spotty
lacing
was
seen
but
very
little
high
carbonation
hence
all
the
tiny
bubbles
every
where
the
aroma
is
not
too
much
really
just
a
light
grain
the
taste
was
almost
like
seltzer
water
with
really
no
flavor
slight
metallic
taste
as
well
for
some
reason
o
a
sad
remnant
of
the
lowcarb
craze
that
spawned
this
beer
if
you
could
even
call
it
a
beer
fizzy
flavorless
and
devoid
of
character
i
drank
three
of
these
things
over
a
month
period
and
tried
to
give
the
brew
as
fair
a
shake
as
possible
in
terms
of
a
review
each
time
all
i
taste
is
lemon
water
and
about
halfway
into
each
one
it
took
a
lot
of
energy
not
to
drain
pour
it
just
awful
not
a
good
session
beer
not
good
for
a
barbecue
not
good
for
anything
that
a
good
cold
glass
of
water
cant
give
you
equally
minus
the
alcohol
this
beer
is
what
it
is
its
an
extremely
light
light
beer
drink
enough
of
them
youll
get
drunk
eventually
i
first
started
drinking
it
because
my
friend
was
a
fitness
guru
and
was
strict
about
his
calorie
intake
and
yet
to
this
day
it
is
my
goto
light
beer
when
i
want
to
get
drunk
im
going
for
this
if
im
going
to
just
enjoy
a
beer
with
a
full
meal
im
going
with
a
quality
nonlight
beer
to
me
ultra
is
in
a
class
above
miller
lite
coors
light
and
bud
light
honestly
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
on
a
hot
day
or
golfing
or
if
you
are
trying
to
lose
weight
but
dont
want
to
throw
your
entire
days
worth
of
calories
out
with
a
couple
beers
i
do
think
this
beer
gets
a
bit
of
a
bad
reputation
by
people
that
just
discard
it
as
a
chick
beer
or
beerflavored
water
if
youre
drinking
it
you
have
to
realize
that
it
is
what
it
is
if
you
want
mountains
of
flavor
this
isnt
the
beer
for
you
however
for
a
light
beer
i
do
think
this
one
has
a
great
taste
if
you
are
debating
whether
to
try
it
or
not
because
youre
afraid
your
manhood
will
be
questioned
just
try
it
for
yourself
and
form
your
own
opinion
i
can
think
of
a
few
reasons
why
beer
drinkers
might
reach
for
a
michelob
ultra
its
a
fine
choice
for
beer
drinkers
who
are
counting
calories
and
carbohydrates
its
crispness
and
wateriness
are
welcome
characteristics
on
very
hot
afternoons
the
thinness
of
its
malt
profile
minimizes
the
nasty
skunk
flavors
of
american
macrolagers
making
ultra
comparatively
enjoyable
indeed
id
reach
for
a
michelob
ultra
before
any
of
the
big
three
coors
miller
budweiser
or
their
light
counterparts
not
to
much
attention
was
paid
to
this
beer
as
not
much
was
expected
however
upon
my
first
taste
i
was
surprised
that
it
actually
had
a
decent
flavor
for
being
a
big
name
beer
its
one
of
the
better
light
beers
in
this
category
in
my
opinion
thats
really
all
i
have
to
say
about
that
overall
i
dont
regret
having
this
beer
but
if
this
is
all
youve
got
just
drink
water
instead
or
just
have
a
soda
now
thats
an
awful
beer
cracked
open
a
slim
can
as
it
was
the
last
beer
in
the
beer
fridge
leftover
from
a
cookout
a
few
weekends
ago
drank
about
half
of
it
while
watching
the
sox
game
and
the
rest
went
warm
eventually
dumped
it
out
and
got
a
glass
of
water
which
was
much
more
satisfying
and
had
just
about
as
much
flavor
hitting
the
craft
beer
store
tomorrow
overall
you
get
what
you
pay
for
thankfully
it
was
free
this
is
nowhere
near
the
worst
beer
out
there
even
in
the
light
beer
category
i
found
it
pleasant
enough
to
consume
and
pretty
terrible
to
smell
most
people
who
drink
this
probably
dont
pour
it
into
a
glass
so
smell
isnt
something
they
are
thinking
about
i
would
not
be
buying
this
again
however
if
i
was
in
the
situation
of
drinking
light
beer
i
know
id
be
safe
with
this
one
clear
nearly
transparent
yellow
colored
brew
white
fizzy
short
lived
head
aroma
of
dry
cereal
grains
namely
corn
and
rice
with
some
malt
there
is
a
small
note
of
grass
in
the
flavor
grain
driven
sweetness
with
a
flash
of
mildly
bitter
hop
that
was
a
surprise
the
flavor
is
quite
light
and
goes
away
quickly
watery
over
carbonated
body
not
the
greatest
beer
here
my
friend
saw
me
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
and
grabbed
it
out
of
my
hand
and
threw
it
into
the
back
yard
id
consider
him
a
good
friend
and
an
even
better
person
sigh
am
i
one
of
those
guys
who
hates
every
light
beer
i
hope
not
i
hope
theres
one
thing
out
there
that
tickles
my
fancy
enough
that
i
dont
cringe
when
hearing
its
name
this
is
now
one
of
the
former
here
is
what
this
beer
gives
you
90something
calories
the
refreshing
taste
of
ice
cold
water
beer
is
that
what
they
are
going
for
probably
and
that
sucks
as
a
beverage
i
guess
it
isnt
half
bad
its
meant
i
suppose
to
be
drunk
out
of
the
bottle
but
i
refuse
as
a
beer
its
bad
its
almost
a
nonbeer
dont
recommend
it
get
drunk
on
lowcalorie
liquor
if
thats
what
you
want
going
entirely
on
style
this
is
a
refreshing
and
easy
to
quaff
light
lager
but
dont
expect
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
just
expect
to
be
refreshed
after
a
busy
day
mowing
the
lawn
if
you
drink
please
dont
drive
and
if
you
have
to
drive
then
do
us
all
a
favor
and
dont
drink
overall
maybe
the
worst
light
beer
i
have
tried
it
barely
had
any
taste
o
id
say
mich
ultra
is
actually
a
better
beer
than
the
typical
bmc
fare
if
only
because
it
is
so
devoid
of
flavor
that
it
avoids
all
the
bad
flavors
definitely
more
drinkable
on
tap
than
bud
for
my
tastes
o
yeah
overall
this
is
disgusting
someone
brought
a
case
over
to
a
barberque
at
my
place
and
ive
been
struggling
on
how
to
deal
with
them
besides
pouring
them
down
the
toilet
been
using
them
as
a
base
to
cook
chili
pretty
much
the
only
thing
theyre
good
for
not
recommended
and
should
be
discontinued
really
not
going
to
snob
out
on
this
beer
it
really
is
designed
for
those
who
are
watching
their
weight
or
have
other
health
concerns
that
said
is
it
a
thintasting
macro
lager
that
doesnt
leave
the
taste
buds
satisfied
of
course
but
is
it
undrinkable
of
course
not
less
of
a
fullness
that
the
ordinary
american
adjunct
lager
but
decent
for
what
it
is
nobodys
gonna
lay
a
finger
on
my
butterfinger
or
michelob
ultra
for
that
matter
this
beer
is
the
absolute
worse
beer
i
have
ever
had
stay
the
hell
away
from
this
atrocity
the
only
instances
in
which
ive
been
able
to
tolerate
i
didnt
say
condone
michelob
ultra
have
been
at
a
ballpark
where
the
beer
selection
is
so
poor
as
to
make
a
bad
light
beer
preferable
to
bad
standardstrength
brands
it
is
after
all
among
its
few
positive
qualities
one
of
the
most
bland
things
ive
ever
tried
summed
up
in
two
words
adult
pop
overall
it
is
very
light
and
moderately
refreshing
and
hence
it
fits
many
of
the
categories
that
a
light
beer
should
it
doesnt
have
a
great
flavor
profile
however
with
some
slightly
off
flavors
especially
toward
the
end
of
the
taste
light
yes
but
super
tasty
no
o
itd
be
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
its
not
disgusting
by
anymeans
and
serves
it
purpose
but
it
doesnt
have
the
big
flavors
i
like
in
beers
still
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
and
im
sure
ill
be
drinking
many
more
overall
i
will
drink
this
beer
with
ease
when
offered
for
free
probably
on
a
golf
trip
overall
ive
drank
this
a
few
times
now
im
canadian
and
where
im
from
this
beer
was
unavailable
till
a
couple
months
maybe
a
year
ago
id
had
it
in
the
states
before
this
and
found
it
appalling
much
to
my
dismay
it
reared
it
ugly
head
in
our
neck
of
the
woods
i
drink
it
when
im
offered
it
at
parties
and
get
togethers
and
could
see
it
being
sessionable
but
i
dont
really
enjoy
the
experience
o
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
not
a
beer
that
i
will
be
getting
again
limited
selection
at
the
airport
lead
to
trying
this
one
it
is
too
thin
and
too
watery
to
really
be
enjoyable
o
while
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
tastes
more
like
writer
with
notes
of
rice
and
hints
of
hops
michelob
ultras
biggest
competition
is
obviously
budweiser
select
both
beers
come
in
at
right
under
100
cal
and
are
intended
to
win
over
the
weightconscious
crowd
i
personally
am
trying
to
drop
about
40
pounds
and
so
i
tend
to
buy
these
watereddown
diet
adjunct
beers
on
occasion
michelob
ultra
is
the
best
of
these
kinds
of
beers
it
taste
like
a
light
beer
but
its
an
ultra
light
not
great
but
not
horrible
ordered
this
from
applebees
draft
16
oz
glass
appearance
is
extremely
light
pale
straw
colored
yellow
clear
as
water
and
almost
as
light
lots
of
bubbles
continue
to
rise
from
the
bottom
to
the
surface
the
head
is
almost
non
existant
no
lacing
but
a
soap
like
bubblineess
smell
is
sweet
corn
and
malts
taste
is
sour
and
tart
light
and
watery
no
discernible
taste
of
hops
or
grains
i
assume
what
i
am
tasting
are
the
adjuncts
rice
and
corn
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
soda
water
this
is
a
beer
that
you
drink
when
you
dont
want
to
take
any
sort
of
enjoyment
from
the
beer
drinking
experience
but
then
again
no
one
drinks
this
for
its
taste
its
diet
beer
but
the
low
alcohol
and
crappy
flavor
nullify
the
fact
that
its
lower
calorie
because
you
would
have
to
drink
several
of
these
just
to
get
a
buzz
thereby
equaling
the
calories
youd
consume
from
drinking
a
quality
beer
basically
its
what
you
drink
when
tap
water
isnt
quite
alcoholic
enough
for
you
there
is
worse
tasting
beers
out
there
but
only
because
this
can
scarcely
be
considered
beer
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
anything
it
pours
lighter
than
piss
about
as
clear
as
my
tap
water
with
soda
carbonation
yet
zero
head
the
nose
is
offensive
old
apple
juice
and
malt
extract
watered
down
way
past
a
reasonable
level
the
taste
is
nonexistant
less
taste
than
any
other
beer
ive
ever
put
in
my
mouth
its
downright
absent
no
body
at
all
too
many
bubbles
what
is
the
point
of
this
if
you
want
to
cut
carbs
dont
drink
beer
at
all
or
skip
the
cereal
in
the
morning
but
dont
shave
away
the
elements
that
makes
a
beer
a
beer
this
is
an
assualt
on
brewing
and
something
i
never
want
to
see
in
my
fridge
again
damn
my
old
man
who
thinks
he
can
get
skinny
on
this
shit
i
like
this
beer
when
its
like
100
degrees
out
or
when
i
need
to
cleanse
my
palate
other
than
that
i
dont
understand
this
beer
but
its
not
bad
just
watered
down
which
is
bad
hmmm
its
somewhere
between
bad
and
watered
down
for
a
low
carb
beer
with
90
something
calories
it
isnt
a
horrible
choice
for
cats
on
a
diet
i
like
to
drink
them
during
the
week
because
they
dont
jack
you
up
and
your
not
killing
yourself
with
late
night
carbs
that
being
said
i
would
never
order
one
at
a
restaurant
and
short
of
the
principle
listed
above
would
probably
never
drink
one
other
than
that
i
appreciate
good
beer
giving
dogfish
head
90
minutes
ipa
a
55
but
im
dissapointed
to
see
such
low
reviews
for
mic
ultra
exactly
what
did
the
reviewers
expect
this
is
as
advertised
a
very
light
low
carb
beer
for
an
active
summer
or
other
season
day
when
the
drinker
does
not
want
to
feel
weighted
downbloated
but
wants
to
enjoy
a
beer
no
this
is
not
the
finest
craft
beer
on
the
planet
but
it
does
not
pretend
to
be
it
does
not
sell
itself
beyond
its
label
overall
this
really
isnt
a
beer
ive
never
seen
a
beer
that
was
such
a
light
shade
of
yellow
the
taste
is
extremely
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
like
a
seltzersoda
not
sure
why
i
picked
this
one
up
curiosity
got
the
better
of
me
my
advice
stay
away
unless
you
carb
watchers
are
desperate
for
a
beerflavored
beverage
this
is
that
beer
its
about
as
interesting
as
drinking
a
box
of
styrofoam
chips
if
you
want
to
drink
something
low
calorie
at
least
go
for
some
clausthaler
amber
this
beers
angle
just
makes
no
sense
to
me
it
is
drinkable
and
easy
but
for
flavor
and
experiences
why
would
i
even
bother
to
have
this
again
certainly
of
the
most
flavorless
beers
around
very
watery
but
still
easier
drinkingslightly
more
enjoyable
than
your
light
coors
busch
bud
etc
this
poured
with
nearly
no
head
and
a
pale
yellow
color
virtually
without
scent
it
has
actually
has
alight
easy
drinking
taste
lets
face
this
is
an
alcohol
delivery
system
for
people
who
want
less
carbs
and
calories
i
must
admit
that
if
i
intend
to
get
intoxicated
and
not
be
filled
up
this
is
the
easiest
drinking
beer
i
can
think
of
overall
refreshing
and
good
after
getting
hot
and
thirsty
easy
to
drink
if
you
want
something
with
flavor
you
need
to
try
something
else
not
quite
sure
exactly
what
the
purpose
is
of
this
beer
yes
its
one
of
the
best
selling
in
the
world
and
yes
it
probably
makes
ab
boat
loads
of
money
but
literally
its
like
drinking
nothing
no
texture
no
taste
no
smell
no
flavor
nothing
just
yellowish
watery
hop
swill
i
shall
forever
pass
on
it
boy
was
that
a
waste
of
8
i
ended
up
giving
it
away
to
my
cousin
because
i
could
barely
stomach
the
bottle
i
had
and
moved
on
to
bigger
and
better
things
budweiser
o
overall
not
the
worst
thing
i
have
ever
had
certainly
better
than
strohs
and
some
other
adjuncts
but
that
isnt
really
saying
much
o
well
now
i
know
why
someone
didnt
bother
grabbing
this
back
once
it
hit
my
fridge
again
a
total
lack
of
anything
resembling
beer
characteristics
malt
hops
body
just
watery
sweet
tasting
and
generally
terrible
finshed
about
13
of
a
glass
rest
is
going
down
the
drain
even
for
a
low
calorie
light
lager
this
is
pretty
bad
with
an
almost
total
absence
of
flavour
what
little
is
there
is
rather
unappealing
as
well
poured
this
light
lager
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
produced
a
small
amount
of
head
poor
retention
and
left
only
a
small
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
cooked
corn
and
cereal
light
in
body
this
brew
has
very
little
grain
flavor
it
tastes
more
of
water
then
it
does
beer
there
is
only
a
ever
so
slight
amount
of
hop
bitterness
dry
finish
overall
one
of
the
most
boringnon
flavorful
beers
that
i
have
ever
tried
o
it
tastes
like
water
probably
be
good
to
drink
with
hot
wings
when
your
tongue
is
numb
from
the
heat
and
you
cant
taste
anything
o
very
cheap
and
light
beer
with
some
flavor
i
like
it
all
in
all
i
drank
15
of
the
glass
and
left
it
on
the
bar
overall
tastes
like
carbonated
water
o
one
pint
was
more
than
enough
an
underwhelming
light
lager
with
flavors
so
mild
it
could
be
mistaken
for
a
pint
of
beer
that
was
mixed
5050
with
water
avoid
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
pretty
much
void
of
any
real
character
which
i
guess
is
fitting
for
the
style
if
you
want
a
beer
that
tastes
as
little
like
beer
as
possible
by
all
means
go
tank
a
case
of
this
and
throw
a
couple
limes
in
the
neck
of
the
bottle
just
for
shits
not
recommended
overall
complete
waste
of
time
the
only
thing
it
has
going
for
it
is
that
its
not
actively
repulsive
this
one
was
offered
to
me
and
i
accepted
having
never
had
it
dont
waste
your
time
the
main
question
on
my
own
mind
is
why
ab
would
even
bother
trying
to
bring
this
into
the
bloated
canadian
light
beer
market
maybe
to
siphon
off
some
coors
drinkers
i
guess
that
could
happen
but
these
beers
are
all
so
indistinguishable
from
one
another
that
i
would
think
mu
is
just
as
likely
to
steal
sales
from
bud
light
as
it
is
from
coors
like
the
beer
itself
it
seems
like
a
pointless
endeavour
overall
ultra
boring
i
never
thought
id
say
pass
me
the
bud
light
superior
light
beer
in
my
part
of
california
it
sure
comes
at
a
premium
price
for
those
looking
for
low
calorie
low
carb
beer
this
works
well
it
is
well
made
but
just
lacks
any
real
character
this
really
seems
like
a
beer
aimed
at
people
who
dont
like
beer
abs
other
beers
in
this
category
have
a
lot
more
going
for
them
even
the
value
brands
cheers
osafe
doesnt
make
me
want
to
down
another
and
get
in
trouble
driving
clean
and
for
its
style
one
of
the
better
ab
offerings
overall
very
watery
and
no
flavour
but
still
better
than
coors
or
bud
light
i
can
see
this
one
doing
really
well
at
retail
level
the
masses
like
a
flavorless
beer
and
this
one
delivers
this
beer
is
mostly
for
people
looking
to
lose
weight
and
still
want
to
drink
the
color
is
light
yellow
not
much
to
it
one
thing
that
surprised
me
about
this
beer
is
its
taste
its
really
really
smooth
i
put
6
of
these
away
with
ease
the
after
taste
of
this
beer
is
what
i
really
enjoyed
its
not
harsh
at
all
very
smooth
all
the
way
through
for
those
watching
their
weight
i
suggest
you
give
this
a
try
o
its
just
okay
i
think
there
are
much
better
adjunct
lagers
to
be
had
i
guess
this
one
is
just
for
people
on
strict
diets
d
none
overall
i
dont
understand
why
light
beers
need
to
be
so
tasteless
this
is
one
of
the
worst
ones
i
have
had
to
sample
if
you
want
some
flavor
in
a
light
beer
have
a
sam
adama
light
avoid
this
i
had
this
beer
over
the
weekend
at
a
parry
poured
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
that
died
almost
immediately
aroma
was
nonexistant
taste
was
minimal
corn
and
adjunct
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
this
was
my
first
and
last
time
to
drink
this
beer
this
may
be
the
lightest
least
flavorful
beer
ive
ever
had
there
is
almost
nothing
here
pours
from
the
12oz
bottle
a
rather
acceptable
golden
hue
with
a
foamy
head
that
settles
into
a
medium
collar
carbonation
is
lively
but
not
overactive
aroma
is
of
sweet
wet
grass
clippings
1st
sip
is
of
club
soda
mixed
with
a
splash
of
light
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
with
a
lively
fizz
from
the
bubbles
again
like
club
soda
drinkability
is
high
but
then
so
is
that
of
club
soda
overall
this
beer
was
given
to
me
for
free
and
i
still
feel
like
i
got
ripped
off
if
youre
that
concerned
about
you
calorie
carb
intake
have
a
diet
coke
instead
oh
well
it
was
good
for
adding
another
rating
this
is
good
if
you
dont
want
a
lot
of
flavor
and
prefer
to
just
have
a
beer
to
chug
or
play
beer
pong
with
there
are
worse
there
are
better
out
there
in
the
world
of
beer
o
terrible
and
worse
than
bud
light
in
the
side
by
side
i
really
hate
to
rate
a
beer
this
low
i
actually
feel
bad
about
it
but
honestly
this
beer
is
just
this
bad
the
beer
came
in
a
glass
and
it
was
so
light
i
legitimately
thought
it
was
seltzer
water
the
lack
of
aroma
and
taste
only
make
it
worse
i
have
never
in
my
life
seen
a
beer
with
this
much
carbonation
either
once
again
i
hate
to
rate
a
beer
this
bad
but
this
beer
is
just
ridiculous
had
a
cute
girl
i
was
hitting
on
not
bought
this
for
me
i
would
have
just
poured
it
into
the
sewer
truly
a
terrible
excuse
for
beer
i
can
see
why
its
considered
a
girl
beer
theres
nothing
there
to
be
scared
of
taste
wise
overall
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
beer
for
people
that
are
watching
carbs
and
calories
at
least
that
is
how
it
is
marketed
southwest
airlines
was
kind
enough
to
treat
us
to
this
swill
after
waiting
for
two
hours
on
the
runway
overall
complete
waste
of
time
the
only
thing
it
has
going
for
it
is
that
its
not
actively
repulsive
this
one
was
offered
to
me
and
i
accepted
having
never
had
it
my
advice
dont
waste
your
time
overall
if
i
ever
need
watered
down
lemonade
ill
make
it
myself
a
tasteless
practically
odorless
mess
why
so
many
people
drink
this
is
an
absurdly
odd
statement
about
how
badly
people
need
to
sample
more
craft
beer
it
has
a
clean
mouthfeel
nicely
carbonated
and
enough
alcohol
to
keep
it
from
tasty
too
watery
overall
drinkability
other
than
the
lack
of
flavor
there
are
no
off
characters
great
light
beer
that
pairs
well
with
any
dish
because
it
make
no
attempt
to
compete
or
compliment
the
black
of
beers
well
they
achieved
what
they
were
after
a
very
light
low
calorie
flavorless
beer
almost
tasteless
but
the
taste
you
do
get
is
very
pleasant
overall
well
its
not
quite
a
drain
pour
but
it
certainly
isnt
something
id
ever
want
to
drink
again
ill
give
this
beer
some
credit
though
for
at
least
having
some
flavor
and
aromas
even
though
they
arent
all
that
pleasant
on
the
only
reason
to
drink
this
swill
it
has
virtualy
no
carbs
i
had
this
at
my
sons
home
he
specificaly
bought
it
because
he
just
started
the
atkins
diet
although
at
4
2
it
is
not
low
alchohol
the
beer
is
clear
piss
yellow
and
have
a
massive
carbonated
head
the
smell
has
a
slight
corn
smell
with
a
tiny
bit
of
grain
the
taste
is
terrible
i
just
get
nothing
at
all
from
this
beer
i
dont
get
how
anybody
can
drink
this
stuff
i
had
to
use
like
10
limes
to
kill
the
flavor
and
make
it
a
little
drinkable
i
just
dont
know
what
to
even
say
about
this
beer
but
it
is
beyond
horrible
i
just
feel
that
it
offers
nothing
at
all
and
it
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
drink
when
my
stone
ipa
ran
out
i
had
no
choice
at
a
friends
house
i
let
him
drink
my
beer
but
ill
try
not
to
have
to
drink
this
again
o
how
does
my
aunt
drink
this
o
while
the
flavor
wasnt
really
good
it
wasnt
offensive
i
suppose
that
counts
as
some
sort
of
moral
victory
i
would
avoid
drinking
this
beer
in
the
future
very
bad
beer
i
call
this
beer
mc
ultra
after
the
u
s
governments
brainwashing
experiments
in
the
70s
codename
mk
ultra
in
part
because
i
figure
you
must
be
brainwashed
to
drink
this
theres
no
aroma
no
flavor
really
theres
nothing
to
this
beer
as
blasphemous
as
this
sounds
youd
be
better
off
mixing
a
craft
beer
with
sparkling
water
if
you
wanted
a
lowcalorie
alternative
with
flavor
otherwise
its
just
not
worth
it
dont
drink
it
the
aroma
had
just
a
light
scent
of
grain
and
the
faintest
whiff
of
hops
the
flavor
was
the
same
just
a
bit
weaker
the
body
was
very
thin
even
considering
the
style
the
beer
was
easily
drinkable
but
so
is
water
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
it
would
probably
make
a
decent
electrolyte
replacement
beverage
after
some
hard
work
or
play
but
as
a
beer
why
bother
it
has
all
the
peeing
with
none
of
the
fun
poured
a
2
white
soap
suds
head
which
faded
really
fast
clear
straw
yellow
color
faintest
little
grass
smell
taste
is
kind
of
like
dirty
seltzer
water
so
this
is
95
calories
youre
better
off
drinking
plain
clean
water
than
this
seltzer
water
out
of
a
dirty
glass
o
if
you
are
actually
drinking
this
beer
while
dieting
im
sure
it
would
be
fine
for
you
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
tastey
sessionable
light
lager
this
is
something
very
worthy
of
a
session
but
very
much
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
it
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
very
quickly
fading
bright
white
head
with
lots
of
bubbles
the
smell
is
of
grass
and
grain
it
is
very
smooth
watery
with
the
taste
of
grass
and
grain
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
lots
of
nice
bubbles
very
light
body
and
very
smooth
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
just
no
flavor
if
youre
spending
the
day
on
a
boat
then
this
beer
works
otherwise
leave
it
alone
you
cant
get
much
lighter
then
a
mic
ultra
the
color
is
quite
clear
and
the
foam
fades
away
quite
quickly
the
smell
and
taste
are
not
too
spectacularthere
isnt
much
of
either
i
would
take
a
bud
light
over
this
however
ultras
or
not
bad
on
a
hot
summer
day
they
dont
fill
you
up
or
weigh
you
down
if
you
ever
get
that
uggh
i
just
drank
a
fat
beer
feeling
you
wont
get
that
here
it
goes
down
and
feels
like
water
in
your
belly
o
mass
produced
garbage
i
am
glad
it
was
a
free
sample
not
the
best
but
hey
its
still
beer
o
basically
a
water
with
few
ingredients
thrown
in
its
only
saving
grace
is
that
it
is
refreshing
but
only
because
it
is
essentially
water
o
its
just
slightly
more
engaging
than
drinking
water
if
you
had
a
choice
this
isnt
the
worst
example
of
the
light
lager
style
but
it
doesnt
have
anything
going
for
it
its
a
run
of
the
mill
average
beer
in
the
mix
with
huge
macro
beers
that
ussually
will
run
marketing
circles
around
it
but
its
better
than
the
big
macro
lights
but
not
by
much
if
you
want
a
light
beer
drink
miller
lite
weak
light
beer
boring
by
all
means
garbage
at
best
ugly
champagne
bubbly
color
with
1
finger
same
color
head
that
receded
quickly
leaving
no
film
to
speak
of
it
looked
like
a
light
beer
drank
like
a
light
beer
and
tasted
like
water
with
a
side
of
bland
bread
it
had
a
boring
and
long
lasting
bad
mouth
feel
that
was
even
unpleasant
to
think
about
even
today
basically
seltzer
water
thin
and
watery
with
a
prickly
rough
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
sorriest
excuses
for
beer
ive
ever
tasted
and
the
complete
lack
of
flavor
is
enough
to
make
bud
light
seem
like
dark
lord
if
youre
on
a
diet
drink
water
not
this
the
next
cheap
beer
available
this
last
week
at
the
beach
this
one
compliments
of
my
brotherinlaw
and
his
wife
can
poured
into
a
glass
not
sure
why
i
bothered
i
thought
the
bud
i
recently
had
was
the
palest
beer
out
there
but
this
one
is
even
paler
looks
like
honeywater
no
head
at
all
nose
is
weak
with
grains
and
butter
the
mouth
is
crisp
its
only
redeeming
quality
the
flavor
if
you
can
call
it
that
is
muted
with
flavors
of
hay
faint
citrus
i
dropped
a
lime
in
the
last
half
of
this
bad
boy
to
help
my
finishing
it
id
rather
have
water
im
not
going
to
bother
keeping
these
things
around
anymore
overall
this
is
a
boring
barely
beer
if
youre
trying
to
cut
your
carbs
you
might
as
well
just
buy
a
case
of
bottled
water
pours
a
very
pale
color
between
straw
and
clear
with
some
carbonation
and
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
on
top
not
much
in
the
nose
some
faint
stale
grain
noticeable
same
on
the
tongue
with
barely
any
noticeable
taste
other
than
stale
grain
skunk
and
what
could
be
conceived
as
a
hop
extremely
light
and
watery
and
goes
down
the
same
to
be
avoided
as
they
say
it
is
what
it
is
a
low
calorie
light
lager
i
thought
a
lot
of
the
calories
in
beer
were
from
the
alcohol
but
this
beer
will
make
you
think
the
calories
were
in
the
flavor
because
this
beer
has
no
taste
way
too
much
carbonation
and
little
substance
dont
reach
for
this
beer
unless
you
are
on
a
diet
even
then
you
may
just
want
to
have
water
instead
overall
just
a
very
bland
beer
i
didnt
find
anything
offensive
about
it
really
it
just
provided
nothing
to
speak
of
d
could
probably
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
and
not
even
notice
but
thats
the
point
isnt
it
if
this
were
my
only
option
for
booze
id
just
stay
sober
overall
unless
you
completely
dislike
the
taste
of
beer
avoid
this
gimmicky
unsatisfying
overpriced
garbage
in
a
can
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
about
it
is
that
there
is
no
repulsive
flavor
which
is
not
hard
to
accomplish
when
there
is
no
flavor
at
all
d
not
my
beer
o
epic
fail
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
light
beer
the
only
time
i
ever
drank
a
steady
supply
of
it
was
because
we
were
playing
drinking
games
in
college
and
you
could
plow
through
an
18
pack
and
still
drink
more
after
the
game
i
would
usually
opt
for
coors
light
but
really
any
light
beer
would
work
this
one
is
a
big
step
below
even
those
beers
the
only
thing
going
for
this
beer
is
that
it
is
low
carb
however
ive
never
seen
anyone
just
drink
one
or
two
of
these
people
finish
the
12
pack
which
really
doesnt
make
it
a
low
carb
beer
rjt
dhow
drinkable
is
water
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
with
out
being
grossed
out
but
it
isnt
enjoyable
drinkability
id
actually
prefer
water
although
water
does
not
have
an
alcohol
content
it
also
does
not
have
calories
if
youre
watching
your
calories
and
trying
to
get
drunk
miller
light
seems
like
a
better
option
man
if
only
i
knew
when
i
was
younger
how
bad
this
beer
was
i
wouldnt
have
ordered
it
one
my
first
venture
to
a
local
bar
when
i
turned
21
had
a
guinness
prior
to
this
and
this
brew
wasnt
going
to
overcome
that
by
any
means
it
was
like
drinking
seltzer
after
the
guinness
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
ive
had
once
and
did
not
have
it
again
it
really
has
not
taste
or
enticing
aroma
the
look
of
it
is
also
not
impressive
i
do
not
condone
drinking
this
beer
unless
you
are
a
true
weakling
drink
a
real
beer
instead
the
cpj
serving
type
bottle
horrific
beer
avoid
unless
youre
a
poor
college
student
even
then
id
drink
soda
ahead
of
this
one
d
i
used
to
actually
drink
a
lot
of
these
before
i
respected
beer
they
arent
even
refreshing
to
me
any
more
im
really
having
to
choke
this
down
this
doesnt
really
deserve
the
label
beer
ok
i
suppose
as
a
cold
beerlike
refreshment
with
a
meal
or
to
quench
ones
thirst
poor
substitute
for
a
real
beer
absolutely
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
it
can
hardly
be
called
beer
the
taste
is
like
if
someone
took
half
a
bottle
of
water
and
added
another
half
bottle
of
bud
light
to
it
the
only
upside
would
be
the
drinkability
i
would
rather
drink
a
nonalcoholic
beer
than
this
d
well
damn
you
could
swallow
it
like
water
but
its
not
very
flavorful
it
has
some
alcohol
content
but
very
little
its
pretty
disgusting
overall
i
would
definitely
pass
on
it
d
wouldnt
be
too
tough
to
drink
several
of
these
but
there
are
better
tasting
light
beers
out
there
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
light
and
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
its
really
not
all
that
appealing
or
drinkable
unless
you
want
an
off
tasting
carbonated
water
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
it
actually
looks
watery
in
the
aroma
sweet
corn
and
faint
ints
of
a
standard
macro
lager
in
the
taste
sweet
pear
like
and
a
watered
down
version
of
a
mass
produced
lager
a
smooth
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
hint
of
fruit
sweet
and
watery
if
you
are
worried
about
calories
dont
drink
d
not
very
most
of
michelob
products
i
have
to
give
higher
drinkability
than
i
want
to
towards
the
overall
average
but
this
is
like
bad
tonic
water
nothing
enjoyable
about
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
body
and
decent
carbonation
however
the
aftertaste
and
taste
in
general
make
this
beer
nearly
undrinkable
d
hey
it
a
beer
to
go
to
town
on
i
can
respect
that
avoid
thought
i
would
revisit
this
long
lost
aquaintence
and
was
of
course
disappointed
in
myself
clear
as
water
watery
pale
yellow
color
cant
believed
i
never
noticed
how
colorless
this
was
thin
white
ring
around
edge
of
glass
aroma
smells
like
cantaloupe
rhine
moderate
carbonation
very
light
all
the
way
through
light
rhiney
taste
for
maybe
a
second
or
too
not
really
much
flavor
some
flavor
in
the
middle
but
not
much
other
than
that
now
i
know
why
these
were
so
easy
to
bong
as
close
to
water
as
you
can
get
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
is
the
most
watery
beer
i
have
ever
sampled
no
taste
no
smell
stinging
carbonated
water
so
you
know
this
has
got
to
be
some
drinkable
beer
yummy
d
i
would
rather
drink
tap
water
this
beer
is
completely
futile
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
doesnt
taste
like
anything
why
waste
money
on
a
product
that
has
nothing
to
offer
to
create
the
perception
that
youre
taking
care
of
your
physique
andor
being
responsible
by
choosing
low
calorie
faddish
flavorless
macro
swill
ill
pass
pours
a
pale
yellow
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
corn
and
some
grain
maybe
a
little
malt
tastes
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
clean
crisp
from
a
lack
of
anything
else
other
than
water
mouthfeel
is
really
thin
drinkability
is
okay
the
mass
market
is
full
of
light
beers
and
this
michelob
ultra
fits
in
with
most
of
them
not
many
calories
not
much
taste
this
bottle
has
a
born
on
date
and
i
am
well
within
the
freshness
date
so
i
cant
attribute
any
of
the
beer
characteristics
to
being
old
the
pour
resulted
in
a
little
head
that
was
gone
in
seconds
leaving
a
ring
with
light
lacing
the
color
is
light
amber
rating
a
2
on
the
srm
chart
so
far
this
is
the
lightest
colored
beer
i
have
rated
not
much
to
smell
a
little
malt
and
yeast
maybe
some
corn
tastes
like
sweet
malt
and
corn
but
very
little
flavor
at
all
mouthfeel
is
like
water
it
guess
that
is
because
it
is
mostly
water
leaves
my
mouth
feeling
dry
because
i
drink
a
beer
for
the
flavor
and
this
one
doesnt
have
much
of
one
i
will
stay
far
away
from
this
brew
pours
foamy
then
dissipates
smells
of
chemistry
class
and
despair
tastes
like
lack
of
selfesteem
eats
hope
i
do
wish
it
were
able
to
clean
drains
what
to
do
with
the
other
five
bottles
otherwise
somehow
salty
perhaps
we
can
start
rumors
about
ingredients
whats
that
you
say
is
in
the
soylent
charlton
no
the
green
one
pours
with
the
tiniest
bit
of
yellow
color
smells
of
faint
grain
and
a
bit
of
cardboard
taste
is
a
bit
more
grain
and
by
grain
i
probably
mean
the
flavor
and
complexity
of
plain
white
rice
feel
is
very
very
light
and
overly
carbonated
drinks
like
carbonated
water
and
tastes
a
bit
worse
that
about
sums
it
up
this
is
a
terrible
beer
d
yeah
it
is
drinkable
but
why
would
you
have
a
bunch
of
these
ill
take
one
good
craft
beer
over
a
few
of
these
anytime
as
far
as
light
lagers
go
there
are
much
better
choices
out
there
as
my
grandfather
liked
his
beer
a
raw
egg
or
some
salt
would
make
this
beer
better
i
think
flying
dog
said
it
best
good
people
drink
good
beer
and
this
is
far
from
good
beer
drinkability
the
beers
best
quality
if
you
can
drink
water
you
can
drink
this
beer
d
i
was
obliged
to
score
this
one
highly
because
this
is
almost
as
drinkable
as
beer
gets
very
easy
to
swig
and
swallow
still
i
dont
want
to
drink
it
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
just
to
marvel
at
its
accomplished
nothingness
not
recommended
served
from
tap
into
a
magic
hat
shaker
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
amount
of
white
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
at
all
on
this
one
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
and
a
nutty
note
the
flavor
was
of
malt
wheat
nutty
and
water
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
just
blah
short
reply
would
be
to
say
that
this
one
sucks
unless
of
course
you
are
trying
to
sober
up
which
i
was
f
drank
this
from
bottle
at
many
bars
restuarants
and
college
parties
no
sustainable
head
pale
gold
color
with
a
terrible
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
not
super
skunky
as
this
is
mostly
water
the
taste
is
all
water
nothing
worth
ever
drinking
pours
a
clean
pale
straw
color
with
minimal
plume
of
white
head
despite
many
bubbles
smell
is
almost
nonexistant
faint
dried
hay
and
slight
corn
taste
is
rather
non
existant
too
except
for
the
light
touch
of
boiled
corn
on
the
finnish
extremely
light
very
watery
and
highly
carbonated
the
only
positive
i
can
say
is
that
the
off
flavors
were
kept
to
a
minimum
but
so
were
all
of
the
flavors
poured
a
clear
bubbly
deep
strawlight
gold
color
with
a
short
lived
fizzy
white
head
dissipated
and
left
with
a
clear
yellow
tinted
liquid
a
light
metallic
nose
and
a
touch
of
corn
not
much
else
can
be
discerned
very
fizzy
im
not
sure
of
where
the
drinkability
comes
into
play
here
its
too
carbonated
for
me
the
light
body
doesnt
support
it
well
flavor
or
what
little
bit
of
corniness
dies
quickly
i
did
not
find
this
drinkable
in
fact
i
ended
up
pouring
it
out
after
a
few
sips
all
in
all
this
beer
has
an
unfairly
low
rating
on
here
in
my
opinion
even
though
id
never
choose
this
beer
its
not
a
drain
pour
its
just
barely
beer
ethereal
mildness
incarnate
generally
inoffensive
and
a
hair
below
table
water
in
thirst
quenching
effectiveness
im
surprised
that
i
got
carded
when
i
ordered
this
for
multiple
reasons
none
of
them
all
that
good
one
of
the
spokes
of
that
boundary
and
cliff
edge
pushing
wheel
that
the
big
boys
of
beer
can
ill
afford
to
not
pursue
apparently
overall
bud
lights
actually
better
this
is
nothing
but
carbonated
water
with
a
little
alcohol
mixed
in
i
really
dont
even
consider
this
beer
a
social
beer
its
a
disappointment
michelob
does
have
several
other
selections
that
are
respectable
i
consider
this
one
to
have
one
of
the
worst
tastes
of
any
beer
ive
tried
d
if
your
objective
is
to
look
cool
you
failed
if
your
objective
is
to
get
drunk
you
failed
if
your
objective
is
to
look
like
you
are
on
a
diet
than
you
have
succeeded
it
is
not
drinkable
and
will
leave
you
feeling
empty
and
lonely
as
people
start
calling
you
a
fag
crystal
clear
and
very
pale
yellow
a
fizzy
white
cap
disappeared
almost
instantly
very
faint
cereal
grain
aroma
slight
fruit
minerals
otherwise
the
smell
is
nearly
nonexistent
not
much
in
the
way
of
bitterness
light
apple
and
grain
metallic
finish
very
light
bodied
slipping
into
the
watery
category
by
the
finish
quite
dry
with
coarse
carbonation
cant
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
at
all
d
i
suppose
if
you
were
really
thirsty
this
might
be
okay
since
its
a
close
relative
to
soda
otherwise
avoid
drinkability
its
so
bland
and
watery
that
i
couldnt
finish
drinking
the
whole
beer
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
anyone
d
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
really
see
why
anyone
would
it
can
hardly
get
you
drunk
it
has
no
real
taste
no
color
no
smell
no
purpose
i
guess
this
is
for
people
who
need
to
have
something
in
their
hand
while
at
the
bar
with
their
friends
d
i
guess
you
could
call
this
drinkable
but
by
no
means
would
i
ever
want
a
session
or
pong
game
with
it
i
suppose
if
you
were
dieting
and
needed
a
session
beer
it
would
do
d
normal
people
like
this
stuff
plus
this
is
a
really
safe
choice
they
wouldnt
spend
that
much
on
advertising
if
it
wasnt
one
of
the
best
beers
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
positive
review
or
a
negative
but
i
keep
it
in
the
house
all
the
time
now
avoid
this
beer
at
all
costs
its
really
disgusting
and
i
have
no
idea
why
people
buy
it
since
its
not
even
cheap
d
very
easy
to
drink
low
abv
plus
only
95
calories
and
low
in
carbs
but
why
my
quest
for
a
good
light
beer
continues
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
from
this
usually
light
beer
is
pretty
bad
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
but
it
left
me
unsatisfied
i
like
to
end
with
a
really
good
beer
so
this
is
definitely
a
starter
beer
for
me
d
i
dont
see
whats
so
ultra
about
this
beer
considering
it
tastes
worse
than
original
michelob
and
original
michelob
was
already
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
there
is
nothing
to
this
beer
at
all
someone
could
switch
your
drink
with
club
soda
and
you
wouldnt
even
know
it
if
you
were
drinking
this
swill
it
is
clean
and
crisp
tasting
but
its
hard
to
screw
up
h2o
i
had
two
of
these
and
doubt
i
ever
will
again
because
really
theres
just
no
point
i
went
from
drinking
bud
light
to
drinking
this
and
the
bl
seemed
complex
in
comparison
its
that
bland
it
is
easy
to
drink
though
which
is
why
i
gave
it
a
2
for
that
but
only
a
2
because
its
not
fun
to
drink
i
have
to
say
this
was
much
better
than
i
had
anticipated
there
is
actually
some
flavor
which
i
expected
none
i
doubt
i
will
drink
this
ever
again
but
i
would
take
it
over
many
other
light
lagers
dyeah
i
gave
it
a
4and
heres
why
bitches
try
drinking
another
light
beer
in
this
calorie
category
and
then
go
pick
it
up
again
ill
drink
the
6
pack
but
id
rather
let
myself
have
3
calorie
packed
delights

the

really
no
taste
at
all
but
like
i
said
before
it
is
a
light
beer
if
you
do
not
like
light
beers
this
is
not
for
you
would
rather
have
a
michelob
or
budweiser
over
this
overall
this
is
an
ok
brew
im
giving
it
a

would
drink

with
a
hotdog
at
a
party

about
drinking
17
more
why
not
just
drink
some
fiji
what

i
wanted

stuff
is
water
i
dont
even
understand
why
this
is
made
sure
its
low
in
carbs
and
everything
but
its
all
empty
calories
its
not
healthy
for
you
wake
up
this
beer
is
sold
based
on
marketing
alone
drinkability
tastes
and
feels
like
sweet
seltzer
water
on
the
plus
side
i
actually
could
finish
it
light
bready
texture
in
consistency
with
a
return
of
a
spritzy
lemon
flavor
reminds
me
in
a
way
of
lemon
flavored
seltzer
thin
and
watery
feel
yet
quite
quaffable
with
no
negative
flavors
surely
better
directly
from
the
bottle
removing
the
look
and
aroma
from
the
equation
where
its
smooth
and
pleasant
better
than
coors
light
by
a
long
shot
yet
theres
nothing
really
there

i
am
not
bothering
to
pour
this
brew
in
to
a
glass
no
real
scent
i
am
drinking
this
cold
right
out
of
the
freezer
on
a
65
degree
spring
day
its
hitting
the
spot
certainly
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
a
small
amount
of
cereal
and
rice
flavors
slighty
sweet
nothing
to
special
here
will
i
drink
some
more
yea
not
bad
stuff
notes
not
all
that
good
even
when
compared
to
other
mass
produced
beers
this
doesnt
stand
out
not
really
worth
going
after
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
if
i
want
a
light
refreshing
beer
its
going
ot
be
an
ultra
its
simply
the
leat
offensive
of
the
light
beers
extremely
light
taste
but
very
smooth
with
no
bitterness
nicely
carbonated
these
go
down
way
easy
and
are
refreshng
when
they
are
ice
cold
good
summer
beer
when
its
brutally
hot
out
and
you
want
to
cool
off
this
beer
has
its
place
summary
why
bother
just
drink
water
i
like
this
one
as
a
light
overall
beer
its
one
i
can
just
sit
around
and
drink
the
overall
beer
factor
of
this
is
its
not
going
to
compare
very
well
with
beers
on
here
but
its
a
good
light
beer
thats
american
made
for
the
masses
that
you
can
put
em
down
michelob
ultra
is
one
of
my
top
beers
officially
thanks
michelob
d
surprisingly
filling
i
didnt
want
to
drink
anything
else
after
the
pint
the
dryness
and
light
flavor
increase
drinkability
the
prickly
carbonation
does
not
i
seriously
cant
recommend
this
one
no
flavor
whatsoever
hardly
any
hops
a
complete
waste
of
money
thank
god
that
i
did
not
have
to
pay
for
it
with
mine
pours
a
nice
golden
color
little
bit
of
fastfading
lace
its
not
bad
for
a
backyard
bbq
or
a
football
game
type
beverage
easy
to
drink
worth
trying
for
said
occasions
price
is
maybe
a
little
above
average
for
this
type
of
beer
but
i
like
it
better
than
bud
ice
or
milwaukees
best
appearance
has
a
light
straw
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
crisp
head
smell
has
a
faint
grainy
sweetness
taste
having
light
grain
and
hops
this
must
be
the
most
diluted
beer
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
not
a
terrible
beer
but
goes
down
real
quick
and
smooth
would
be
exellent
on
a
hot
day
d
i
liked
with
the
clam
chowder
while
i
will
agree
this
beer
isnt
the
greatest
to
have
but
it
has
its
place
in
the
world
of
beer
very
light
pale
almost
no
head
little
lacing
light
in
flavor
not
impressive
just
a
good
beer
to
drink
if
you
dont
care
about
quality
and
just
want
to
get
a
buzz
without
collecting
a
lot
of
carbscalories
i
like
this
beer
but
it
does
kind
of
suck
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
which
disappears
right
away
there
is
almost
no
smell
to
this
maybe
some
cooked
corn
and
thats
about
it
taste
what
taste
light
cooked
corn
and
mostly
just
water
feels
thin
and
watery
fair
carbonation
very
dry
and
bland
i
had
this
one
at
new
years
eve
and
am
willing
to
try
most
beers
at
least
once
but
will
not
have
this
again
remember
this
is
a
light
beer
pours
very
pale
amber
with
a
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
minimal
and
somewhat
corny
taste
is
very
light
with
a
champalelike
body
even
in
a
light
beer
category
this
is
weak
nothing
bad
in
this
beer
just
hard
to
call
it
a
beer
a
fine
brew
for
those
who
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
very
champagne
like
d
dont
drink
this
if
you
want
a
beerthis
is
for
the
low
calorie
seeker
only
all
of
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
were
just
average
nothing
special
just
a
lower
calorie
version
of
an
american
light
lager
the
only
edge
this
beer
has
is
in
drinkability
because
you
can
have
a
bunch
of
them
and
not
have
a
calorie
overload
d
well
good
since
it
is
very
close
to
water
in
fact
i
would
take
a
nice
glass
of
ice
water
over
this
beer
i
mean
it
i
would
rather
have
water
and
then
later
crack
open
a
beer
with
some
taste
4
0
overall
i
wouldnt
turn
down
one
if
it
was
free
like
i
said
previously
there
are
certainly
more
offensive
beers
out
there
but
like
many
i
just
cant
see
the
point
of
a
beer
like
this
i
know
that
a
lot
of
people
drink
it
to
watch
their
weight
but
honestly
if
i
was
watching
mine
id
rather
not
drink
at
all
than
have
this
bottle
poured
a
super
light
yellow
color
lager
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
that
disappeared
very
quickly
aroma
of
very
light
adjunct
and
water
taste
is
lighter
then
coors
light
which
i
didnt
though
was
possible
with
light
adjunct
and
very
little
else
to
note
body
is
closer
to
perrier
then
any
other
beer
i
drank
before
one
of
the
blandest
beer
i
have
drank
in
my
life
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
very
mild
aroma
some
hints
of
corn
really
no
taste
to
speak
of
beer
flavored
water
feels
light
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
not
bad
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
sorry
excuse
for
beer
but
since
i
need
to
take
of
a
few
pounds
i
guess
there
is
a
purpose
for
it
drinkability
a
beer
for
those
who
dont
like
calories
and
dont
like
flavor
bland
watered
down
incredible
light
with
too
much
carbonation
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
crisp
and
clean
the
body
of
the
beer
is
super
light
and
the
finish
is
nil
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
the
beer
fits
well
in
the
guidelines
for
its
style
and
that
is
only
the
reason
why
it
got
this
rating
as
with
many
macros
in
a
can
it
pours
with
a
decent
fingerandahalf
of
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
the
really
striking
aspect
of
this
beer
is
its
color
holy
urine
batman
my
stream
this
morning
was
darker
than
this
it
was
an
ultrapale
lemonyellow
with
ultra
nequality
clarity
hell
i
could
see
through
walls
with
this
one
the
nose
had
a
slight
cereal
quality
but
that
was
after
repeated
sniffs
trying
to
discern
even
something
worth
mentioning
ultra
hohum
mouthfeel
was
light
airy
ultra
smooth
almost
like
i
was
not
even
drinking
water
no
air
no
beer
oh
thats
right
i
was
supposed
to
be
drinking
beer
well
you
could
not
prove
it
by
this
concoction
ultra
boring
finish
was
ultra
nonexistent
wow
give
this
a
wide
berth
unless
ultra
boredom
is
your
bag
this
was
a
5
second
drink
then
about
a
23
glass
drainpour
i
normally
no
matter
how
much
i
dislike
a
beer
will
drink
it
this
one
i
just
couldnt
bleh
gross
ordered
at
uncle
julios
poured
starw
coloured
with
thin
head
no
smell
and
soda
water
0
1
hop
taste
surprisingly
not
even
a
hint
of
malt
waterlike
with
high
carbonation
if
you
want
a
session
without
any
stopping
or
guilt
this
could
be
a
possible
choice
avoid
well
they
didnt
give
a
glass
so
i
had
to
drink
it
from
the
bottle
so
appearance
gets
an
automatic
f
right
smells
like
ass
too
tastes
like
sweet
cornflakes
left
out
in
the
sun
for
a
week
i
mean
goddamn
this
is
bad
i
finished
it
though
since
i
had
to
get
my
six
bucks
worth
overall
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
light
and
thin
this
is
just
a
fancy
way
of
saying
a
light
beer
is
light
a
very
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
no
lacing
aroma
of
light
sweet
corn
faint
grain
and
very
littlke
else
flavor
is
very
light
some
light
malt
raw
grain
and
carbonated
water
no
hop
flavor
at
all
no
bitterness
prickly
mouthfeel
from
too
much
carbonation
light
body
no
aftertaste
drinkable
but
not
very
good
nothing
offensive
just
not
at
all
what
i
look
for
in
a
beer
like
aroma
and
flavor
im
not
sure
what
the
ultra
refers
to
cuz
this
beast
is
just
awful
looks
like
a
watered
down
glass
of
some
other
superpale
beer
smells
like
nothing
else
really
just
michelob
ultra
tastes
like
cup
of
water
thats
been
filtered
through
a
bag
of
rotten
grains
i
wouldnt
wish
this
on
my
worst
enemies
drinkability
is
the
highlight
here
could
easily
down
a
12
of
these
perhaps
the
worst
beer
ive
consumed
since
chelada
i
mean
im
not
a
hater
on
these
styles
necessarily
but
comeon
draw
the
line
somewhere
millerbudcoors
have
all
created
beers
that
are
light
and
low
in
calories
how
far
do
we
have
to
go
d
easy
to
drink
in
a
volume
sense
but
i
would
rather
have
as
little
of
this
as
possible
skip
the
95
calories
of
slightly
flavored
water
and
just
have
a
nice
refreshing
glass
of
pure
h20
i
drank
this
to
find
out
weather
the
rest
in
my
pantry
are
worth
saving
for
my
next
party
no
reason
not
to
keep
it
it
is
a
ver
very
hot
humid
day
today
so
it
went
down
easy
and
fast
but
this
is
not
anything
id
sit
and
sip
or
even
cook
with
why
buy
this
crap
if
you
could
imagine
boiling
corn
and
rice
in
the
same
pot
then
straining
it
and
adding
sugary
seltzer
to
the
water
the
corn
and
rice
boiled
in
you
would
come
close
to
this
however
this
is
an
utlra
light
beer
coming
in
at
95
calories
and
is
useful
when
trying
to
loose
weight
like
i
have
been
doing
for
the
past
few
months
and
it
has
paid
off
considerably
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
however
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
but
is
an
alternative
to
drinking
a
high
abv
high
calorie
beer
when
trying
to
work
out
and
loose
weight
this
is
the
best
ultra
light
beer
i
have
had
to
date
pours
a
see
through
yellow
white
color
the
smell
is
of
nothing
there
is
a
hint
of
some
type
of
grain
the
taste
is
of
nothing
but
a
barely
there
grain
the
taste
is
watery
but
at
least
not
offensive
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
overall
there
is
not
much
to
this
beer
it
is
pretty
simple
and
weak
all
over
yet
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
it
it
is
really
nothing
to
speak
of
perversely
i
have
given
this
a
very
high
drinkability
rating
because
i
think
if
i
was
after
a
beer
to
drink
by
the
bucket
until
i
was
rotten
drunk
then
this
would
be
right
up
there
as
it
tastes
of
nothing
it
would
be
very
hard
to
get
sick
of
it
poured
very
light
yellow
in
color
had
a
white
head
that
basicly
diappeared
in
a
few
seconds
no
lacing
at
all
after
pouring
you
never
even
realized
it
had
a
head
in
the
beginning
smelled
like
nothing
maybe
some
grain
or
corn
but
really
smelt
like
nothing
tasted
like
a
watered
down
busch
had
that
ab
slight
sweet
flavor
very
very
light
in
the
flavor
area
felt
like
water
in
the
mouth
maybe
to
much
over
carbonation
i
guess
i
expected
to
much
from
michelob
wont
drink
again
cheers
d
the
dump
i
took
while
writing
this
sentence
from
notes
had
10x
more
character
than
this
crappy
beer
for
the
masses
that
want
to
work
out
while
drinking
a
beer
as
their
ads
imply
its
drinkable
for
any
selfrespecting
beerloving
person
its
unacceptable
poured
out
the
rest
after
the
review
was
done
the
pour
left
no
head
and
it
had
a
very
dilute
apple
juice
appearance
to
it
there
was
minimal
lacing
at
first
but
nothing
on
the
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
faintly
like
water
from
a
summer
warmed
hose
nothing
really
discernible
but
really
had
a
slight
smell
of
rubber
to
it
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
terrifyin
and
i
doubt
it
would
have
been
much
better
without
my
previously
mentioned
experience
pours
pale
very
thin
white
head
utterly
transparent
smells
of
grain
husks
and
corn
why
do
i
get
corn
on
this
thing
to
be
so
thin
on
calories
it
could
at
least
have
the
decency
to
smell
like
nothing
tastes
of
air
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
water
wheres
that
gross
corn
i
smelled
i
was
kinda
looking
forward
to
some
gross
corn
its
slightly
flat
too
good
one
i
tried
this
beer
because
it
happened
to
be
the
beer
of
the
month
at
my
regular
bar
the
waitress
warned
me
that
it
was
like
water
but
i
tried
it
anyway
and
she
was
right
simply
put
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
and
probably
wont
ever
get
it
again
drinkability
well
the
only
time
this
is
even
close
to
drinkable
is
if
youve
been
involved
in
some
sort
of
sporting
activity
and
are
about
dead
tired
ew
with
all
the
ipas
and
stouts
i
have
had
over
the
years
this
tastes
so
bland
i
poured
this
into
my
trusty
drinking
mug
and
it
looks
tepid
and
bland
bland
yellow
color
no
head
at
all
and
has
no
character
to
it
whatsover
this
beer
is
made
for
the
ones
who
have
to
drive
the
drunkards
home
because
with
even
3
of
these
they
will
not
get
a
buzz
this
stuff
has
no
character
to
it
whatsover
would
rather
drink
211
at
least
i
know
i
will
have
something
going
on
after
a
couple
yuk
what
the
hell
am
i
drinking
my
boss
left
this
in
my
hotel
fridge
so
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
spin
note
to
self
dont
drink
left
over
beer
from
my
boss
ever
again
i
dont
think
this
should
be
allowed
to
be
called
beer
it
should
be
considered
carbonated
water
with
a
bit
of
yellow
color
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
water
some
how
the
carbonation
is
supercharged
and
gritty
pale
almost
clear
yellow
with
a
slight
skim
of
foam
around
the
edges
smells
very
faintly
of
creamed
corn
and
nothing
else
this
beverage
takes
flavorless
to
new
levels
very
similar
to
sparkling
water
watered
down
grain
and
faint
artificial
sweetness
very
light
effervescent
mouthfeel
finishes
squeaky
clean
my
buddy
left
a
few
of
these
in
the
fridge
and
i
just
couldnt
resist
i
think
this
beer
is
for
those
that
want
a
diet
beer
without
all
that
beer
flavor
getting
in
the
way
at
least
this
makes
anything
from
their
craft
series
taste
great
but
of
course
thats
conditional
as
it
gets
as
a
runner
weightlifter
and
beer
drinker
i
am
the
target
market
for
this
stuff
and
you
couldnt
pay
me
to
drink
it
so
whos
buying
this
crap
poured
a
very
light
golden
color
with
a
very
little
head
that
quickly
disappeared
this
was
probably
the
lightest
beer
ive
seen
in
a
while
the
smell
was
very
little
i
managed
to
get
a
bit
of
a
grain
smell
with
just
a
quick
hint
that
it
was
a
beer
tasted
a
bit
grainy
with
a
light
metallic
taste
mouthfull
was
very
carbonated
that
left
a
dry
finish
in
my
opinion
this
ultra
light
has
very
characteristics
only
beer
i
found
in
my
sisters
fridge
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
taste
pours
a
very
very
pale
straw
watery
color
decent
carbonation
and
no
head
smells
like
pee
with
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
taste
is
not
as
bad
as
some
other
mainstream
beers
it
is
somewhat
sweet
and
thats
about
it
no
real
flavors
that
stand
out
kind
of
malty
but
maybe
its
more
rice
flavored
of
course
if
you
add
lots
of
lime
juice
and
a
little
vodka
it
can
be
a
decent
mixed
drink
good
while
mowing
the
lawn
but
i
would
prefer
something
else
overall
it
was
an
unremarkable
bland
beer
that
did
not
bring
much
flavor
low
abv
carbonated
watery
taste
and
there
are
better
light
beers
out
there
as
someone
else
said
drinking
it
seemed
to
ask
the
question
whats
the
point
trash
good
if
you
want
to
count
calories
but
why
buy
something
as
cheap
as
this
when
you
can
settle
for
a
pint
of
guinness
every
now
and
then
there
are
plenty
of
beers
that
are
light
in
alcohol
and
full
of
flavor
avoid
this
crap
overall
carbonation
is
standard
for
the
style
as
for
drinkability
since
i
didnt
find
the
taste
horrible
i
cant
put
the
drinkability
very
far
down
seeing
as
how
drinking
a
case
of
this
may
be
possible
in
an
hour
or
two
if
you
care
about
calories
more
than
flavor
go
for
it
not
much
but
some
in
my
opinion
it
is
one
of
the
better
mass
prodcued
beers

i
guess
its
good
if
you
like
this
sorta
thing
for
light
beer
but
its
shy
on
taste
mouthfeel
and
abv
so
its
leaves
thinking
whats
the
point
drank
dec
27
from
bottle
into
shaker
glass
very
little
color
very
little
flavor
looked
at
the
last
sip
or
two
and
wondered
if
it
was
water
or
beer
waiting
for
me
low
carb
low
everything
overpriced
in
the
premium
beer
market
almost
as
bad
as
bud
light
i
prefer
miller
lite
over
this
anyday
bad
beer
and
does
not
deserve
the
michelob
name
attached
to
it
future
outlook
nah
not
unless
im
looking
to
turn
back
the
clock
to
college
times
and
get
drunk
on
alcoholic
water
i
understand
carb
and
calorie
counting
but
id
rather
become
a
belgian
monk
then
to
drink
this
godawful
swill
the
antibeer
for
any
selfrespecting
ba
ugh
a
drinkable
beer
whos
major
advantage
is
a
low
carbohydrate
count
will
not
fill
you
up
no
matter
how
much
you
drink
it
is
average
in
almost
every
category
for
its
typeappearance
smell
taste
better
than
many
lite
beers
but
not
overly
impressive
head
does
not
last
it
is
best
drank
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
dont
think
i
hate
this
brew
as
much
as
the
rest
of
you
its
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
but
could
be
worse
color
and
appearance
is
pretty
average
for
the
style
flavor
is
where
you
can
start
the
bitching
i
think
someone
before
me
said
it
is
kinda
like
a
ginger
ale
i
can
taste
that
now
that
i
think
about
it
nothing
too
special
here
just
a
below
average
brew
this
is
another
one
of
those
beers
that
is
nice
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
its
ice
cold
i
drink
it
often
because
it
prevents
me
from
having
to
keep
going
to
the
bathroom
to
take
shots
which
can
be
embarrassing
if
im
trying
to
socialize
when
im
by
myself
at
my
house
i
would
never
not
a
hint
of
hops
aroma
and
even
the
corn
character
was
barely
noticable
flavor
was
one
with
the
aroma
more
noticeable
for
what
was
not
there
than
what
was
left
a
slightly
dry
alcoholic
aftertaste
with
an
astringent
bitter
edge
to
it
i
suppose
this
stuff
is
really
quite
drinkable
because
theres
so
little
to
it
and
as
long
as
it
is
icecold
your
taste
buds
will
stay
numb
if
its
warm
toss
it
back
like
a
grenade
that
lands
in
your
foxhole
with
the
pin
out
or
fall
on
it
to
save
your
friends
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
slight
head
and
absolutely
no
retention
also
of
course
theres
no
lacing
smells
of
what
you
would
expect
adjunct
in
a
lager
i
guess
it
fits
this
great
style
smooth
and
crisp
is
the
best
i
can
say
about
this
beer
tastes
bland
watered
down
mostly
adjunct
in
lager
overall
not
very
good
at
all
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
the
most
translucent
shad
of
yellow
i
have
ever
seen
pour
out
of
a
beer
bottle
it
really
looks
like
yellow
bubbly
water
the
only
thing
that
i
can
give
it
credit
for
is
the
fact
that
the
pour
produced
a
huge
3
finger
white
head
when
looked
down
from
the
top
of
the
glass
it
really
looks
like
a
pretty
beer
the
smell
is
really
watery
with
just
a
hint
of
corn
the
taste
is
well
canned
corn
water
the
mouthfeel
is
nonexistent
just
like
water
if
you
like
drinking
water
stick
with
the
tap
if
you
like
drinking
beer
move
on
to
something
else
either
way
avoid
this
beer
do
i
even
need
to
say
anything
well
i
have
to
have
two
hundred
fifty
characters
so
i
guess
i
will
in
all
seriousness
this
is
made
for
a
female
to
look
good
in
the
bar
with
a
trendy
im
drinking
a
beer
like
the
guys
kinda
thing
not
saying
women
dont
drink
beer
but
most
usally
have
this
kind
of
thing
in
hand
wife
came
home
with
a
6pack
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
watereddown
budweiser
to
recap
clear
yellow
pour
sickening
corn
syrup
nose
watery
beerlike
taste
with
straw
and
sugar
upside
you
can
drink
a
ton
since
it
is
as
close
to
water
as
you
can
get
downside
you
have
to
drink
a
ton
of
this
to
like
it
a
travesty
pours
a
very
light
watery
golden
yellow
with
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
dissapears
aroma
consists
mostly
of
corn
and
frat
house
hallways
very
watered
down
with
extremely
bland
corn
flavor
very
light
and
nasty
the
whole
way
through
disgusting
this
was
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
in
fact
this
is
a
good
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
these
were
free
at
the
time
but
i
must
say
as
a
beer
lover
i
switched
to
coffee
after
two
of
these
i
had
this
at
a
friends
house
the
friend
one
of
my
very
best
is
very
concerned
about
calories
so
this
is
all
he
had
this
does
not
really
look
taste
smell
or
feel
like
a
real
beer
the
color
is
exceptionally
pale
a
slight
malt
meets
your
nose
but
dies
after
a
sip
or
two
i
honestly
couldnt
really
taste
this
beverage
but
i
admit
ive
hardened
my
taste
buds
over
the
years
of
sucking
down
lots
of
strong
italian
espresso
and
bitter
pale
ales
the
texture
is
like
carbonated
water
and
so
it
is
a
thirst
quencher
michelob
is
producing
some
nice
beers
these
days
but
this
one
is
good
only
for
being
polite
to
a
close
friend
with
calorie
sensitivity
my
marge
likes
this
beer
and
drinks
it
regularly
and
she
is
a
bonafide
expert
on
european
weisse
beers
i
know
big
brewery
light
beers
get
a
bad
rap
especially
herethis
one
is
not
bad
for
the
style
which
is
very
light
lager
pours
with
a
decent
head
light
in
taste
and
goes
down
way
too
smooth
its
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
things
real
quick
not
impressive
and
not
worth
the
price
but
if
you
limited
to
coors
light
bud
light
miller
lite
and
this
i
would
go
for
this
drinkability
very
easy
only
good
for
long
hot
days
lawnmower
beer
d
if
youre
looking
for
something
to
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
summer
day
look
no
further
if
youre
looking
for
even
an
inch
more
than
that
then
by
damn
keep
looking
d
as
i
said
above
the
first
mouthful
i
thought
not
bad
it
was
a
knock
off
drink
i
was
thirsty
but
by
the
end
i
thought
how
boring
absolutely
nothing
of
interest
to
entice
me
back
the
one
redeeming
quality
of
this
beer
is
that
it
makes
excellent
beertails
you
want
something
with
no
flavor
to
compete
with
the
liquor
i
like
to
add
a
shot
of
butterscotch
schnapps
for
butter
beer
made
some
snide
remark
about
watching
my
figure
and
reluctantly
accepted
the
mich
ultra
it
was
a
friday
afternoon
after
a
long
work
week
so
just
about
anything
would
have
hit
the
spot
the
fact
that
people
voluntarily
drink
this
stuff
is
surprising
there
is
nothing
to
it
no
retention
i
was
tired
of
drinking
the
other
nonstarters
they
were
offering
e
g
nothing
going
on
like
seltzer
water
with
a
splash
of
beer
flavor

its
not
the
worst

ive
tasted
in
terms
of
offending

watery
gold

w
a
quickly
dieing
head
that
greets
me
the
barwecnch
didnt
even
bother
tilting
the
glass
watery
beer
peasant
all
in
all
this
one
tastes
like
a
diet
beer
very
watered
down
and
yes
i
am
aware
of
the
purpose
of
a
3
2
state
describing
a
weak
tasting
beer
it
reallly
tastes
watered
down
really
watered
down
the
only
saving
grace
on
this
one
is
the
fact
that
the
only
option
they
have
is
an
amber
little
head
or
retention
for
that
part
the
only
thing
i
can
same
about
this
is
that
it
did
feel
crisp
thats
why
i
gave
a
2
for
mouthfeel
not
bitter
but
then
again
not
much
of
anything
this
is
as
light
as
it
gets
for
someone
that
wants
to
drink
beer
with
their
friends
but
is
watching
their
weight
and
does
not
not
beer
much
anyways
this
is
the
beer
for
you
light
as
it
gets
nothing
more
nothing
less
gives
you
bloatedness
while
tasting
like
water
this
beer
is
for
the
weak
stomached
or
if
youre
trying
to
see
how
many
you
can
drink
it
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
short
white
head
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
smell
except
that
stale
beer
smell
light
hops
and
malts
watered
down
to
almost
nothing
the
taste
is
the
same
as
well
it
tastes
watered
down
with
some
light
hops
and
light
malts
in
there
to
get
the
most
out
of
the
beer
id
give
it
a
decent
rating
on
the
drinkablility
because
it
is
closer
to
water
than
to
most
beer
the
worst
this
is
the
only
beer
i
feel
comfortable
ranting
about
for
people
who
drink
it
i
understand
what
youre
looking
for
and
my
advice
is
this
take
a
shot
of
cheap
vodka
chug
a
glass
of
water
and
do
some
jumping
jacks
instead
aside
from
the
1s
i
gave
it
a
2
for
drinkability
because
i
would
be
comfortable
chugging
this
if
offered
one
that
way
i
could
immediately
order
something
different
this
is
just
my
opinion
and
its
ok
if
this
is
your
beer
but
i
would
suggest
mic
light
instead
leave
it
the
first
time
i
drank
one
was
from
a
bottle
after
a
four
hour
drive
on
a
hot
day
and
i
found
it
to
be
light
and
refreshing
now
i
see
it
for
what
it
is
a
truly
crap
beer
cheap
but
still
poor
value
admittedly
there
are
no
off
smells
or
tastes
but
frankly
there
are
almost
no
smells
or
tastes
at
all
my
girlfriend
suggested
adding
a
slice
of
lemon
and
i
agree
with
her
it
needs
something
or
better
still
buy
a
good
beer
instead
pours
an
extremely
pale
golden
with
a
bright
white
head
that
fades
immediately
to
almost
nothing
smell
is
lightly
sour
and
vaguely
citrusy
and
grainy
sorta
like
a
poor
quality
orangina
knockoff
thats
been
watered
down
there
is
an
underlying
cereal
sweetness
the
taste
is
unbelievably
light
an
initial
graininess
and
then
nothing
it
just
fades
off
in
a
burst
of
effervescence
that
tastes
vaguely
of
slightly
sweetened
club
soda
that
being
said
as
weak
as
this
is
i
prefer
its
inoffensiveness
to
the
cooked
corn
taste
to
so
many
other
american
macro
lagers
this
one
is
barely
a
beer
but
i
could
see
sucking
one
down
while
mowing
the
yard
but
only
if
i
were
out
of
water
another
fun
reviewer
to
say
i
am
sessioning
this
is
to
say
one
is
tastetesting
a
chicken
nugget
sad
when
a
beers
advertisiements
actually
do
approximate
what
to
expect
from
the
taste
sparkling
translucent
effervescent
yellow
body
with
a
hint
of
headchampagne
from
a
distance
light
hints
of
bread
and
dough
classic
cereal
a
bit
of
chemical
cleanliness
light
watery
body
that
bubbles
around
the
tonguefleeting
in
presence
the
beechwood
aging
appellationwould
best
apply
here
refreshing
is
the
commercial
and
euphemistic
word
for
anything
this
ultra
no
surprises
a
beer
that
somehow
manages
a
measly
amount
of
carbs
and
sacrifices
a
ton
of
character
possibilities
for
a
chance
to
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
by
clubhopping
hipsters
or
so
notes
the
commercials
and
im
strangely
okay
with
that
from
this
distance
then
again
i
like
chicken
nuggets
d
well
if
youre
looking
for
something
that
makes
it
seem
as
if
youre
drinking
beer
without
all
of
the
malt
and
hops
getting
in
the
way
then
this
is
your
beer
refreshing
but
only
as
much
as
a
nice
glass
of
water
would
be
above
average
drinkability
for
the
style
thanks
to
the
merciful
lack
of
taste
ive
had
this
numerous
times
and
just
now
getting
to
reviewing
it
pours
a
decent
amber
color
with
little
to
no
head
and
practically
no
lacing
really
has
no
smell
to
it
at
all
the
taste
is
ok
when
nice
and
cold
but
as
it
warms
up
like
most
macros
it
begins
to
suffer
overall
its
an
average
to
below
average
beer
but
certainly
not
the
worst
ive
ever
had
drinkability
low
carb
come
on
is
this
what
weve
reduced
ourselves
to
macrobeer
was
already
reduced
down
in
flavor
and
calories
a
hundred
times
before
this
drink
came
around
america
macros
supposedly
made
good
beer
before
ww2
and
then
they
marketed
after
the
women
so
what
does
that
tell
youno
offense
to
any
women
on
this
site
that
like
good
beer
i
tried
it
because
one
of
my
friends
had
it
in
her
fridge
and
i
wanted
to
rate
it
for
myself
to
be
honest
the
low
score
is
not
because
it
tastes
bad
it
doesnt
it
is
just
not
beer
and
doesnt
deserve
credit
just
because
it
tastes
like
seltzer
as
opposed
to
a
bad
tasting
beer
that
tried
to
make
an
interesting
taste
mich
ultra
has
an
average
look
very
pale
straw
coloring
with
some
carbonation
almost
no
head
and
little
lacing
it
has
almost
no
scent
to
it
and
very
little
taste
its
very
bland
it
goes
down
easily
but
only
because
its
nearly
water
it
would
be
all
right
for
quenching
your
thirst
after
mowing
your
lawn
but
so
would
a
cool
glass
of
h2o
d
not
very
tasty
because
theres
simply
a
lack
of
any
flavor
goes
down
easy
for
the
same
reason
not
filling
at
all
even
among
macros
there
isnt
much
that
would
make
me
pick
this
beer
the
fact
that
its
so
light
seems
to
be
the
only
thing
that
it
has
going
for
it
really
doesnt
have
much
to
offer
for
a
beer
lover
if
you
like
pale
flavorless
beers
and
you
care
about
carbs
then
this
one
it
right
up
your
alley
but
ab
was
trying
to
make
a
lowcarb
beer
and
they
achieved
this
goal
they
didnt
attempt
at
flavor
or
complex
nature
remember
that
when
reviewing
this
beer
because
i
love
tons
of
quality
brews
but
since
im
a
fitness
addict
during
the
week
when
i
want
a
brew
i
dont
need
something
with
a
metric
ton
of
calories
but
something
tells
me
a
large
percentage
of
the
people
truly
bashing
this
beer
for
its
caloric
content
etc
have
guts
hanging
over
their
beltlines
just
a
thought
if
you
feel
like
drinking
a
case
and
not
getting
full
or
putting
on
weight
this
is
probably
the
way
to
go
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
better
head
than
i
expected
about
1cm
of
creamy
head
that
stood
up
above
the
rim
for
a
while
then
faded
to
a
thin
layer
that
clings
to
the
glass
smells
a
lot
like
the
inside
of
an
empty
soda
water
bottle
like
plastic
tastes
like
nothing
ive
had
vodkawater
with
more
flavor
than
this
mouthfeel
is
mildy
fizzy
and
very
watery
i
would
say
this
is
a
boring
beer
but
im
not
sure
its
even
beer
as
far
as
i
can
tell
they
didnt
use
any
malt
or
hops
if
it
was
possible
to
brew
beer
without
using
yeast
or
water
i
imagine
they
would
have
skipped
those
too
i
dont
know
why
everyone
rips
on
this
beer
it
certainly
doesnt
deserve
such
a
low
rating
there
are
way
worse
beers
out
there
than
this
its
on
scale
with
bud
light
miller
lite
etc
i
like
it
better
than
bud
light
a
light
watery
generic
beer
not
that
bad
though
pure
unadulterated
crap
no
body
subtlety
nor
taste
diet
beer
anheuserbusch
is
a
marketing
genius
that
has
weightconscious
females
drinking
this
crap
because
its
lowcarb
this
is
the
worst
of
what
america
has
to
offer
color
is
sickly
light
yellow
and
almost
no
aroma
mouthfeel
is
basically
just
carbonation
the
head
on
this
stuff
lasts
just
shy
of
2
seconds
d
not
a
good
beer
if
you
want
a
light
beer
drink
guinness
it
was
not
hard
to
drink
this
beer
but
wont
have
again
unless
free
d
under
no
circumstances
should
anyone
ever
drink
this
beer
stick
with
michelob
and
forget
this
thing
even
exists
im
pretty
sure
that
this
was
mislabeled
this
is
seltzer
water
not
beer
i
give
it
a
1
5
for
smell
because
water
doesnt
smell
bad
it
gets
a
1
5
on
drinkability
because
water
is
very
slamable
it
isnt
very
cheap
it
doesnt
taste
good
nor
like
beer
and
you
shouldnt
drink
beer
if
you
are
on
a
lowcarb
diet
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
that
this
should
ever
be
bought
by
anybody
good
thing
is
was
free
to
me
pass
on
this
and
go
with
busch
or
budweiser
pbr
coors
instead
if
you
have
to
drink
a
lite
macro
if
you
are
goingt
to
drink
this
beer
because
of
low
carbsyou
should
not
drink
anything
at
all
it
makes
you
think
is
there
a
real
different
between
having
a
good
beer
with
100
to
120
carbs
or
punish
your
self
with
this
beer
for
some
carbs
and
the
taste
where
to
begin
no
really
where
theres
almost
no
flavor
here
its
a
little
sour
and
a
touch
bitter
but
overall
its
just
fizzy
theres
not
much
else
to
say
other
than
people
who
drink
this
probably
dont
like
beer
in
general
i
suppose
you
could
drink
a
hundred
of
them
if
you
really
wanted
to
but
why
put
yourself
through
that
another
bland
massmarket
lager
next
time
i
will
pass
even
if
it
is
free
i
am
not
slamming
it
it
just
is
not
my
style
to
each
their
own
pours
a
straw
golden
pale
empty
nothingness
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
and
what
is
there
is
gone
soon
after
smells
like
water
with
a
splash
of
beer
kinda
of
muted
all
around
taste
is
halfway
decent
for
macro
lagers
i
like
it
better
than
the
few
others
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
empty
only
a
slighty
dirty
grainy
mouthfeel
can
describe
it
drinkability
is
fairly
low
although
its
supposed
to
be
light
and
easy
to
drink
id
much
rather
buy
some
yuengling
and
enjoy
that
for
about
the
same
price
than
drink
this
for
an
evening
what
can
i
really
say
about
this
looks
bad
smells
like
air
and
tastes
like
flavored
water
at
a
concert
it
is
all
you
can
get
so
its
what
you
are
left
with
pale
yellow
carbonated
water
that
has
to
be
drank
freezing
or
it
is
completly
untolerable
please
look
somewhere
else
this
is
hands
down
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
pinnacle
of
american
macro
lagers
as
far
as
tasteless
swill
goes
it
is
utterly
devoid
of
any
aroma
and
taste
spritzy
though
and
only
64
calories
low
carbs
why
even
drink
beer
if
youre
going
to
reduce
yourself
to
this
nothing
is
the
only
thing
i
can
say
about
this
one
congrats
to
the
brewers
at
ab
you
absolutely
cannot
top
this
years
of
taking
flavor
and
aroma
out
of
beer
all
that
expertise
has
culminated
in
this
take
a
bow
please
this
is
more
like
bottled
carbonated
water
than
beer
thin
watery
very
little
color
very
little
head
no
lacing
very
little
aroma
very
little
taste
mind
you
its
not
unpleasant
its
not
awful
and
its
not
skunked
theres
just
not
much
here
for
one
dollar
a
bottle
you
could
get
much
more
and
you
should
d
not
that
easy
after
drinking
a
few
of
them
im
glad
im
not
watching
my
carb
intake
and
i
dont
have
to
drink
this
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
nothing
nada
zilch
i
gave
it
a
1
5
because
it
didnt
smell
bad
the
taste
is
the
same
nothing
you
can
drink
this
beer
while
working
out
i
thought
i
might
have
tasted
something
but
i
cannot
find
it
again
amid
the
high
carbonation
the
feel
is
watery
bubbly
this
is
yellow
soda
water
nothing
else
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
you
do
not
want
this
i
give
them
big
points
for
producing
what
they
intend
and
getting
it
all
the
way
down
under
with
negligible
loss
in
quality
its
clean
and
wet
not
much
else
to
it
but
importantly
to
me
there
are
not
any
faults
other
than
perhaps
too
fizzy
had
a
good
head
at
the
start
then
almost
totally
dissapeared
into
nothing
the
color
is
strange
being
that
it
is
absolutely
crystal
clear
very
light
yellow
scattered
bubbling
carbonation
is
seen
with
spooty
traces
of
foamy
lace
it
looks
like
yellow
tinted
water
basically
if
i
am
going
to
drink
macroproduced
beer
this
and
coors
light
is
always
the
usual
choice
it
doesnt
taste
that
bad
and
goes
down
real
easy
plus
it
has
like
95
calories
a
can
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
making
it
real
filling
dry
refreshing
finish
with
almost
no
bitterness
or
hop
character
at
all
its
basically
a
bubbling
malt
beverage
with
a
low
abv
has
a
light
sweet
rice
or
corn
with
a
faint
wheat
taste
the
only
thing
this
cheap
beer
is
good
for
is
impressing
people
with
how
many
cans
you
can
finish
off
the
aroma
has
a
faint
malt
aroma
with
no
hops
but
has
the
typical
lager
smell
good
beer
for
a
cookout
but
not
worthy
of
a
session
beer
not
a
beer
that
i
would
recommend
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
like
michelob
light
and
water
d
if
you
are
thirsty
this
is
as
good
as
water
this
is
no
real
beer
though
for
someone
just
looking
to
get
drunk
with
as
little
interference
from
the
tastebuds
as
possible
this
is
you
weapon
of
choice
ill
never
drink
this
again
appearance
an
ultraclear
yellow
like
a
thimble
of
urine
poured
into
a
liter
of
water
the
only
thing
that
saves
this
from
a
1
is
that
it
has
a
head
nose
is
incredibly
faint
grains
taste
is
mild
corn
and
nothing
else
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
drinkability
is
similar
to
that
of
water
overall
a
true
ultralight
light
taste
light
body
light
enjoyability
a
terrible
excuse
for
a
beer
even
thinner
than
a
coors
light
avoid
i
though
i
would
see
this
beer
in
museums
by
now
but
long
after
the
atkins
diet
fad
i
still
see
people
drink
this
stuff
speaking
of
atkins
how
is
eating
a
pound
of
bacon
healthier
than
eating
one
apple
im
not
going
to
buy
into
something
like
that
and
neither
should
you
the
only
reasons
to
drink
this
are
to
add
to
your
beers
reviewed
list
and
to
remind
you
this
is
beer
to
the
lowest
common
denomenator
as
the
joke
goes
light
beers
are
like
doing
gymnastics
on
the
beach
flippin
close
to
water
drinkability
one
could
drink
many
of
these
if
he
did
not
desire
flavor
and
complexity
i
found
it
rather
tasteless
and
boring
at
first
glance
this
beers
appearance
isnt
as
bad
as
other
light
macros
but
as
they
say
looks
can
be
deceiving
hardly
any
aromas
to
speak
of
maybe
some
mild
metallic
and
corny
husk
this
beer
literally
tastes
like
seltzer
with
a
bit
of
malt
flavoring
added
its
just
awful
its
about
as
light
as
a
beer
can
get
this
is
what
people
who
dont
really
like
beer
drink
or
chicks
who
think
they
are
watching
their
weight
big
time
pass
on
this
decided
to
review
this
after
it
was
left
in
my
fridge
after
new
years
eve
poured
a
lighter
than
pale
yellow
with
a
thincarbon
filled
head
similar
to
a
soft
drink
it
smells
bready
with
little
substance
this
is
continued
into
the
taste
bready
with
little
taste
and
heavy
carbonation
the
carbonation
dominates
the
mouthfeel
if
you
can
drink
carbonated
water
this
is
drinkable
poured
this
one
out
after
13
of
the
glass
no
thank
you
i
am
not
a
lager
drinker
normally
but
got
this
purely
because
of
this
site
so
i
could
review
it
i
must
be
getting
sad
in
my
old
age
however
you
are
all
overlooking
the
actual
best
usage
for
the
beer
it
does
make
a
good
marinade
for
shellfish
weve
also
used
it
before
as
the
base
of
steaming
shrimp
and
crabs
cheap
easy
and
doesnt
pain
me
to
use
because
i
dont
want
to
drink
it
i
really
dont
know
why
people
wouild
spend
money
on
this
stuff
if
you
are
that
weight
and
health
conscious
just
drink
water
out
of
the
tap
and
forget
about
paying
for
the
dark
bottle
and
michelob
label
poured
out
with
the
faintest
of
light
golden
color
crystal
clear
and
bubbly
zero
head
retention
the
nose
gave
me
nothing
a
tiny
amount
of
grain
perhaps
this
drank
like
acrid
spring
water
more
like
hmmm
whats
that
off
flavor
in
my
water
than
hmmm
wheres
the
flavor
in
my
beer
strangely
enough
it
went
from
no
taste
to
foul
tasting
after
finishing
off
the
bottle
this
beer
is
yet
another
testament
to
why
people
shouldnt
go
on
the
atkins
diet
i
cant
help
but
believe
that
if
i
drank
this
for
a
few
hours
straight
there
would
be
no
discernable
difference
between
the
liquid
going
into
my
body
and
the
liquid
coming
out
an
all
around
average
beer
i
dont
see
why
everyone
rated
this
quite
as
low
as
it
is
there
was
actually
a
bit
of
head
and
lacing
with
this
beer
so
i
cant
knock
the
appearance
the
taste
is
relatively
bland
and
watered
down
but
there
is
some
dry
malt
taste
and
a
bit
of
spice
to
keep
it
fresh
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
my
liking
very
uneventful
light
body
that
is
fizzy
watery
and
made
for
the
masses
that
dont
mind
this
style
wheres
the
alcohol
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
beer
with
at
least
some
flavor
miller
high
life
light
might
be
more
up
your
alley
with
similar
calorie
content
as
this
are
they
sure
this
is
beer
i
thought
it
was
just
carbonated
corn
starch
and
water
i
just
hope
people
that
drink
this
like
my
future
mother
in
law
can
try
to
find
a
light
beer
that
isnt
insulting
to
the
name
like
sam
adams
light
maybe
d
when
they
say
light
beer
they
arent
kidding
light
color
no
smell
light
taste
avoid
at
all
cost
i
am
almost
more
dissappointed
when
i
hear
someone
order
this
than
if
they
order
bud
light
it
may
seem
gimmicky
but
i
dont
think
this
one
will
go
away
anytime
soon
the
drinkability
is
really
not
very
good
even
free
i
am
not
going
to
finish
it
but
34
gives
me
enough
to
work
with
here
stay
away
mk
crisp
feeling
on
the
palate
goes
down
easy
better
than
some
lite
beers
but
still
not
my
type
its
not
repulsive
but
you
might
as
well
just
drink
sparkling
water
cheers
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
beer
this
is
not
it
if
you
are
hoping
to
save
a
few
calories
and
especially
carbs
this
cant
be
beat
smell
is
kind
of
funky
the
taste
is
quite
waterish
and
it
will
take
about
4
before
you
feel
any
buzz
whatsoever
essentially
this
beer
is
good
for
what
it
was
created
to
be
a
low
carb
macrobrew
even
for
a
light
beer
michelob
ultra
is
pretty
underwhelming
light
yellow
in
appearance
with
a
simple
smell
and
near
nonexistant
taste
carbonated
watereddown
beer
towards
the
end
its
hard
to
finish
would
be
fine
if
you
were
desperate
or
having
a
burger
or
hot
dog
at
a
bbq
and
trying
to
avoid
the
calories
but
sam
adams
light
amstel
light
or
even
bud
light
would
be
a
better
choice
i
hope
to
never
drink
this
again
only
did
this
one
because
it
was
free
overall
a
good
substitute
if
your
tap
water
is
contaminated
drinkability
comes
from
the
lack
of
any
nonwater
flavor
to
speak
of
quite
possibly
the
worst
macro
brew
that
i
have
ever
imbibed
michelob
ultra
is
horridly
pathetic
honestly
bud
light
has
more
taste
and
thicker
mouthfeel
and
thats
saying
something
appearance
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
thinnest
of
thin
heads
poured
yellowiest
of
fizzy
yellow
lagers
smell
is
in
the
distance
as
the
taste
what
little
taste
there
is
is
of
warm
corn
mouthfeel
is
also
thin
as
a
sheet
of
paper
the
upside
you
can
drink
it
like
water
go
ahead
it
wont
make
ya
choke
up
no
beer
characteristics
to
be
afraid
of
in
fact
i
was
questioning
myself
as
to
if
there
was
any
alcohol
in
this
beer
it
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
hard
to
desrcibe
because
it
doesnt
really
smell
like
anything
the
taste
slightly
resembles
a
lager
but
for
the
most
part
it
tastes
like
water
mouthfeel
was
also
rather
waterlike
i
gave
it
a
2
on
drinkability
because
you
could
easily
drink
alot
because
it
is
so
light
clear
pale
straw
with
a
fizzy
white
sodalike
rapidlydiminishing
head
smells
of
weak
grain
light
doughy
yeast
and
light
metal
the
taste
is
so
mild
its
ridiculous
but
its
not
offensive
it
has
a
thin
body
watery
sodalike
texture
and
very
lively
carbonation
sure
its
refreshing
i
guess
but
so
is
water
a
whybother
kind
of
beer
md
this
beer
was
very
lighthence
how
it
is
marketed
almost
water
like
in
body
with
high
carbonation
i
could
see
how
you
might
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
to
cool
down
but
not
too
much
for
the
pure
enjoyment
factor
why
bother
with
this
one
in
a
word
no
not
again
anyway
cheers2beers
the
last
time
i
saw
something
this
color
was
in
the
urinal
not
much
to
the
pour
with
corn
in
the
nose
taste
was
watereddown
to
get
to
be
ultra
this
beer
gives
the
michelob
premium
brand
a
bad
name
if
its
possible
id
rather
drink
water
and
this
was
my
first
and
last
ultra
and
it
gave
me
a
headache
to
boot
thanks
augie
michelob
ultra
came
served
on
tap
in
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
typical
macro
yellow
with
no
head
smells
and
tastes
like
corn
its
just
not
very
good
drinkable
at
ice
cold
temperatures
preferably
on
a
hot
day
in
other
words
lawnmower
beer
not
recommended
wtf
this
is
a
good
working
definition
of
what
a
beer
shouldnt
be
but
think
of
how
many
calories
i
saved
this
is
the
worst
beer
of
all
time
avoid
if
possible
no
hops
all
water
no
flavor
makes
you
wanna
vomit
michelob
dry
was
good
and
not
available
any
longer
this
watered
down
mess
is
the
residual
of
carb
nutheads
gone
wild
not
recommended
whatsoever
the
color
of
this
beer
was
very
light
and
had
a
very
light
aroma
that
smelled
faintly
of
malt
and
adjuncts
the
taste
wasnt
very
much
of
anything
to
be
honest
and
was
nothing
more
than
crisp
the
mouthfeel
was
like
carbonated
water
and
was
of
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
im
not
trying
to
be
hard
on
this
beer
but
its
hard
to
consider
a
beer
drinkable
when
there
isnt
much
taste
to
it
if
you
are
that
concerned
about
calories
than
just
drink
water
in
summary
irregardless
of
personal
biases
i
felt
that
this
beer
was
less
than
impressive
when
it
comes
to
taste
and
quality
this
is
water
there
is
no
color
to
it
there
is
no
aroma
there
is
nothing
its
called
ultra
light
for
a
reason
there
is
an
ultra
low
amount
of
beer
quality
in
this
beer
if
you
want
a
low
carb
beer
go
for
miller
lite
d
well
its
drinkable
in
the
way
that
water
is
drinkable
seriously
i
could
get
away
with
drinking
this
while
i
was
working
out
perhaps
hydration
is
the
one
value
to
gain
from
mich
ultra
this
is
seriously
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
i
cant
even
think
of
what
is
second
on
that
list
now
its
memory
has
been
clouded
by
this
beverage
poured
perhaps
the
palest
pale
very
clear
with
bubbles
quickly
rising
but
no
head
smell
is
very
clean
some
light
corn
and
adjunct
aroma
not
much
bit
of
grain
taste
is
crisp
carbonated
extremely
light
and
clean
not
much
flavors
to
describe
really
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
crisp
a
drinkable
beer
its
just
that
i
dont
want
to
drink
it
if
that
makes
sense
much
better
beer
out
there
dont
waste
your
cash
unless
you
dont
like
flavor
in
beer
or
are
an
extreme
calorie
counter
drinkability
looks
like
water
tastes
like
water
it
must
be
water
this
might
even
be
cheaper
than
water
in
some
places
this
ultralite
beer
is
kind
of
like
catching
a
400
lb
marlin
on
4
lb
test
it
looks
good
for
an
instant
then
its
long
gone
deep
yellow
color
has
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
faint
sweet
hops
taste
is
alot
of
carbonation
with
some
hints
of
beer
flavor
kind
of
a
beer
flavored
soda
water
once
again
as
most
ab
products
i
believe
this
is
designed
to
be
dranken
ice
cold
on
a
blustery
summer
day
if
this
were
the
case
right
now
i
could
drink
a
case
of
these
i
cant
really
smell
this
it
is
light
and
watery
but
for
its
style
it
isnt
bad
for
beer
it
is
terrible
but
comparing
it
to
other
american
macro
lager
offerings
not
bad
i
tried
to
keep
that
in
mind
when
making
my
review
i
was
at
a
movie
theater
so
the
cup
was
frostcolored
plastic
still
from
what
i
could
see
it
was
very
light
colored
and
pale
it
retained
a
thin
head
for
a
long
time
as
it
warmed
the
malts
became
more
defined
it
tasted
slightly
fruity
there
was
no
identifiable
hops
taste
given
the
choice
between
this
and
city
water
which
tastes
like
a
swimming
pool
id
drink
this
that
was
my
choice
i
had
five
of
these
left
in
my
fridge
by
a
friend
i
didnt
purchase
them
so
i
thought
i
would
review
this
beer
poured
into
a
20
oz
pint
glass
the
color
is
lite
yellow
emphasis
on
the
word
lite
there
is
alot
of
carbonation
in
the
glass
as
well
there
is
an
aroma
there
in
the
first
scent
but
i
can
not
place
it
it
is
very
faint
taste
is
very
similar
to
water
no
taste
at
all
in
the
mouth
it
feels
like
water
with
carbonation
added
with
coloring
to
make
it
look
like
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
be
negative
toward
this
beer
because
of
the
brewery
it
comes
from
it
is
valiant
effort
to
make
a
beer
low
carb
but
they
left
the
taste
at
the
door
this
beer
fits
the
description
of
monty
pythons
line
from
the
bruce
sketch
american
beer
is
like
making
love
in
a
canoe
i
could
go
through
every
category
and
describe
this
beer
but
that
would
be
a
waste
of
time
i
guess
its
ok
if
youre
looking
to
cut
some
calories
or
carbs
but
for
the
beer
enthusiast
it
offers
very
little
that
you
couldnt
get
from
a
bud
miller
or
coors
light
which
are
equally
as
bland
they
just
sport
a
smaller
price
tag
save
your
money
heineken
bud
bud
light

select
and
michelob
ultra
all
in
all
this
is
the
second
best
beer
to
give
to
your
girlfriend
to
drink
if
she
refuses
to
drink
beer
behind
labatt
blue
light
take
it
for
what
it
is
it
certainly
it
is
not
the
beer
drinkers
light
beer
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
moderate
white
puffy
head
that
quickly
disappeared
smell
is
minimal
with
only
a
slight
sweetness
noted
taste
is
very
light
and
nonoffensive
really
not
much
to
describe
evcept
for
a
slight
swweetness
finish
is
refreshing
but
not
hops
found
if
you
need
to
drinka
low
caerb
beer
this
one
is
ok
drinkability
i
couyldnt
even
finish
one
of
these
pours
a
slightly
yellowed
clear
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
nothing
over
top
very
active
carbonation
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
hte
pint
glass
nose
is
faint
whisps
of
grain
and
corn
sweetness
but
very
faint
flavor
is
just
as
faint
as
the
nose
hints
of
adjunct
sweetness
and
very
light
grainyness
feel
is
watery
with
an
active
carbonation
drinkable
beer
but
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
not
something
i
would
keep
around
this
takes
the
light
lager
to
a
new
level
of
bad
the
pain
of
the
fizz
mixed
with
the
horrible
flavor
made
me
dump
this
out
drinking
less
than
half
of
it
this
is
an
incredibly
bad
beer
and
not
in
the
usual
macro
tastes
like
nothing
sense
this
actually
tastes
like
feet
very
nice
look
little
head
but
very
clear
yellow
as
desired
for
style
the
aroma
is
awful
though
it
has
a
very
odd
chemicalcorn
smell
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
the
flavor
is
ok
for
style
which
isnt
saying
much
but
im
gonna
rate
this
one
by
style
what
the
hey
its
crisp
clean
bland
easy
to
drink
a
very
faint
sweetness
at
the
end
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
as
well
that
rapidly
subsides
are
the
only
things
i
can
pick
up
mouthfeel
is
light
ok
for
style
and
the
beer
is
somewhat
drinkable
not
a
great
beer
not
even
that
great
of
an
american
macro
to
me
the
biggest
tragedy
is
ive
been
on
lowcarb
for
a
while
it
works
its
great
but
its
low
carb
not
nocarb
and
its
much
better
to
drink
a
hefty
good
beer
with
more
carbs
than
this
crap
unless
you
drink
6
beers
every
night
which
i
dont
i
cut
carbs
in
sweets
and
some
starches
not
in
beer
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beer
i
even
drinking
his
taste
is
like
a
budweiser
family
beers
the
same
poor
flavor
made
whit
rice
and
choicest
hops
boring
not
much
more
to
be
said
orbitalr0xsep

but
slight
body
is
very
thin
and
light
carbonation
masks
any
flavor
or
texture
in
the
body
or
aftertaste
finishes
grainy
and
suddenly
just
slight
of
crisp
or
dry
no
alcohol
and
light
hop
character

im
the

if

goes
as
planned
more

malty
all
and
all
the
aroma
was
nothing
outstanding
but
was
crisp
refreshing
beer
that
on
a
hot
day
did
its
job
i
swiped
this
one
from
my
dads
case
that
we
keep
for
him
for
my
house
because
he
helps
out
so
much
almost
no
hops

or
flavor
like
a

said
i
just
wish
this

will
go

it
took
me
a
long
time
to
admit
publicly
that
i
like
the
beegees
admitting
to
buying
and
drinking
michelob
ultra
is
just
as
difficult
for
me
but
i
will
continue
until
sam
adams
comes
out
with
a
2
6
carb
beer
hopefully
better
than
their
current
light
offering
it
is
drinkable
as
in
like
a
glass
of
water
how
bad
can
cheap
ass
beer
get
you
got
your
answer
right
here
with
michelob
ultra
i
love
the
commercials
ab
puts
out
for
this
beer
people
pumping
iron
and
rewarding
themselves
by
drinking
this
crap
ha
how
can
this
stuff
ever
be
considered
a
reward
its
just
carbonated
water
tastes
like
water
smells
like
water
with
a
shot
of
rubbing
alcohol
in
it
feels
like
water
with
carbonation
added
hey
it
is
water
sometimes
i
really
wonder
how
much
it
costs
ab
to
make
this
stuff
water
costs
close
to
nothing
and
ow
much
can
co2
cost
so
i
guess
this
beer
cost
ab
practically
nothing
except
for
the
cost
of
all
those
commercials
this
is
highly
drinkable
but
so
is
water
this
might
be
the
lightest
beer
that
i
have
seen
looks
like
water
with
a
splash
of
yellow
very
small
head
that
doesnt
last
i
smell
almost
nothing
maybe
a
hint
of
something
sweet
like
corn
syrup
no
hops
and
no
malt
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
nothing
i
have
heard
a
lot
of
people
bitch
about
other
light
beers
but
this
one
really
deserves
it
it
is
almost
like
they
have
stripped
this
beer
down
to
nothing
there
is
nothing
else
they
can
take
away
drinkability

i
cant
believe
im
writing
this
but
this
beer
isnt
half
bad
i
thought
the
phrase
beer
flavored
seltzer
water
was
a
beer
snob
exaggeration
until
i
tried
michelob
ultra
it
indeed
tastes
like
seltzer
water
with
a
light
beer
flavoring
which
is
in
no
way
an
exaggeration
i
dont
even
know
what
to
write
about
theres
barely
any
taste
to
the
beer
whatsoever
the
aftertaste
is
bready
thats
about
it
ill
have
this
again
when
i
run
out
of
water
not
recommended
unless
you
do
not
like
the
flavor
of
beer
wow
i
cant
believe
i
drank
this
at
least
i
didnt
pay
for
it
a
guy
i
know
brought
it
to
our
new
years
eve
party
yes
i
know
that
was
days
ago
i
just
couldnt
bring
myself
to
review
this
partly
shame
partly
that
i
want
to
forget
the
experience
poured
a
very
clear
very
light
yellowish
color
like
someone
put
a
drop
or
two
of
yellow
food
coloring
in
water
those
of
you
who
couldnt
smell
this
be
glad
the
smell
was
horrid
smelled
like
rotten
egg
very
very
gross
made
me
want
to
put
it
back
in
search
of
something
that
i
could
stomach
thankfully
it
didnt
taste
like
it
smelled
to
be
honest
it
tasted
fairly
close
to
bud
light
like
a
watered
down
rice
beer
no
hops
to
speak
of
light
in
the
mouth
no
bite
just
like
drinking
water
as
far
as
the
mouthfeel
went
drinkability
they
wish
ill
never
drink
this
again
it
took
me
a
few
hours
to
get
over
the
smell
of
it
i
suppose
if
youre
on
the
adkins
diet
and
you
are
adamant
that
the
beer
is
what
caused
the
gut
then
this
could
be
the
beer
for
you
however
as
i
observed
this
is
not
the
beer
for
me
i
went
right
back
to
the
bully
porter
i
brought
and
tried
to
drown
my
tastebuds
in
something
theyd
enjoy
i
also
appologized
to
them
for
hours
palest
yellow
i
have
ever
seen
not
appetizing
in
the
least
the
head
has
some
retention
probably
because
it
is
so
light
gravity
has
no
effect
on
it
there
is
absolutely
no
aroma
at
all
i
practically
snorted
some
just
to
be
able
to
say
something
about
it
but
to
no
avail
the
taste
just
sucks
subtle
husky
grain
and
c02
bitterness
i
swear
this
is
club
soda
or
seltzer
water
goddamn
this
is
a
miracle
of
science
to
be
able
to
make
something
with
4alcohol
look
and
taste
like
carbonated
water
its
easy
to
bash
this
beer
but
it
really
does
taste
like
water
to
me
sparkling
water
with
some
beer
essence
in
there
somewhere
i
have
no
other
description
to
add
to
taste
or
mouthfeel
but
sparkling
water
very
drinkable
though
you
could
give
this
beer
a
1
if
it
was
the
least
bit
offensive
but
it
doesnt
do
much
one
way
or
the
other
goes
down
easy
but
why
would
you
want
it
to
i
can
feel
the
unsightly
flab
melting
away
as
i
type
this
this
is
the
beer
for
people
who
believe
what
they
see
on
tv
its
a
macro
trend
that
is
all
in
all
crap
miller
lite
at
least
has
some
flavor
to
it
and
not
much
more
on
the
carb
scale
if
youre
watching
the
carbs
drink
captain
and
diet
coke
but
skip
this
one
drinkability
ick
i
cant
believe
i
drank
this
but
my
family
had
ordered
it
and
i
thought
i
should
see
just
how
bad
it
was
ultra
is
ultra
bad
if
youre
watching
your
weight
i
suggest
frinking
slimfast
hell
mix
slimfast
with
gin
for
a
martini
itll
taste
better
this
is
the
least
flavor
of
a
beer
that
ive
ever
had
it
has
a
tiny
bit
of
that
nuttiness
that
regular
michelob
has
but
its
so
faint
that
you
really
have
to
be
looking
for
it
to
notice
it
it
does
have
a
little
bit
of
a
citrusy
character
to
it
that
almost
gives
it
character
but
really
it
tastes
kind
of
like
city
water
on
the
pour
a
lucent
pale
gold
color
the
head
modest
in
size
and
white
in
color
the
texture
frothy
and
the
lace
a
very
thin
sheet
nose
is
crisp
and
clean
the
start
slightly
sweet
top
cadaverous
finish
stinging
in
its
acidity
hops
scarce
dry
and
a
totally
forgettable
beer
this
isnt
beer
as
it
pours
the
colour
of
carbonated
seltzer
water
the
aroma
is
of
water
and
carbonation
as
is
the
taste
no
hops
no
malts
no
beer
flavor
mouthfeel
is
that
of
water
but
the
drinkability
is
nonexistant
the
fact
that
this
stuff
sells
so
well
just
shows
how
many
people
are
slaves
to
marketing
if
you
are
on
atkins
just
drink
water
dont
spend
17
a
case
for
this
junk
or
hey
if
you
really
like
beer
go
with
amstel
light
that
has
only
95
calories
and
5
carbs
and
it
actually
has
get
this
beer
flavor
to
it
do
you
like
water
of
course
you
do
if
you
are
ooking
for
a
buzz
but
like
the
taste
of
water
then
mu
is
what
you
like
my
gf
likes
it
for
the
atkins
aspect
but
i
still
dont
i
mean
tis
is
water
w
abv
basically
dont
drink
it
if
you
hafta
but
if
you
like
water
by
all
measn
go
for
it
ugh
i
dont
know
why
i
waste
my
time
but
i
have
to
be
a
completist
haha
anyway
if
you
like
this
beer
do
not
read
this
review
in
fact
you
should
leave
the
site
this
is
not
beer
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
this
is
swill
of
the
worst
kind
not
only
does
it
look
bad
smell
bad
and
taste
bad
you
have
to
pay
for
this
what
pay
for
water
what
an
outrage
ah
well
i
am
glad
its
over
no
taste
whatsoever
to
leave
behind
so
i
guess
that
can
be
construed
as
a
good
thing
otherwise
get
thee
behind
me
any
and
all
ab
products
my
wife
bught
me
a
12
pack
with
the
idea
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
while
trying
to
cut
carbs
you
know
the
atkins
thing
anyway
probably
good
while
on
that
diet
but
for
a
lover
of
full
bodied
hopped
micros
and
home
brews
this
one
tasted
like
carbonated
water
i
really
had
to
try
to
get
some
flavor
here
i
could
do
the
same
thing
by
putting
a
tablespoon
of
homebrew
in
an
empty
bottle
and
fill
it
up
with
water
carbonate
it
and
there
you
go
lots
cheaper
too
hmmm
did
i
have
a
bottle
of
perriair
as
seen
in
spaceballs
or
was
that
a
beer
its
questionable
this
brew
is
light
as
hell
probably
the
lightest
beer
ive
ever
had
there
are
quite
simply
no
characteristics
here
it
looks
somewhat
like
a
beer
but
if
it
werent
for
that
i
might
not
have
known
what
u
was
drinking
as
i
couldnt
detect
a
dominant
smell
or
taste
the
drinkability
goes
up
because
its
really
like
having
a
glass
of
water
but
overall
this
just
isnt
a
good
brew
blah
this
was
actually
not
as
bad
as
i
had
expected
the
appearance
was
that
of
a
regular
light
beer
with
less
of
a
head
that
dissapeared
when
you
blinked
the
smell
was
the
same
of
any
other
light
beer
the
taste
was
much
better
than
i
expected
from
this
it
tasted
good
to
me
today
however
there
was
a
bit
of
a
watery
taste
to
it
the
mouth
feel
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
very
watery
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
one
setting
i
guess
that
is
what
it
is
made
for
however
just
because
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
one
setting
doesnt
mean
i
will
taste
if
the
colour
was
light
the
flavour
was
lighter
it
tasted
as
if
someone
cut
a
michelob
light
with
tonic
water
this
is
the
white
wine
spritzer
of
beer
no
real
malt
and
the
hops
are
there
only
if
you
really
think
about
it
also
seems
overly
carbonated
i
guess
you
could
say
its
got
drinkability
since
its
like
drinking
water
actually
i
would
prefer
water
to
this
stuff
low
carbs
be
damned
give
me
some
flavour
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
that
i
have
ever
tried
i
kept
asking
myself
why
why
why
the
color
was
extremely
light
and
not
enticing
much
like
the
aroma
no
hop
aroma
what
so
ever
and
a
taste
that
is
almost
nonexistant
a
very
watered
down
beer
i
had
to
put
some
hops
in
the
beer
to
give
it
at
least
a
decent
aroma
to
help
me
finish
the
beer
the
beer
pours
a
pale
almost
clear
gold
color
very
light
the
head
laces
nicely
the
nose
smells
like
regular
michelob
but
noticably
lighter
the
taste
is
very
watery
but
still
maintaining
the
lager
flavor
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
finishes
crisp
its
a
gusler
no
doubt
and
a
bonafied
chick
beer
i
guess
if
you
enjoy
macrobrewed
lagers
like
michelob
this
is
a
beer
you
would
be
excited
about
its
the
old
philosophy
of
less
calories
larger
consumption
i
dont
worry
myself
with
calorie
counts
whats
the
point
if
a
beer
tastes
good
drink
it
like
anything
else
in
life
use
in
moderation
local
bar
has
50
cent
macro
draft
specials
and
i
decided
to
try
this
finally
before
getting
a
bottle
of
dead
guy
ale
light
lemony
yellow
color
is
almost
clear
the
smell
is
sort
of
a
faintly
skunked
psuedobeer
aroma
the
taste
is
slightly
metallic
like
bad
well
water
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
harsh
and
the
drinkability
is
very
poor
i
actually
returned
about
23
of
the
glass
and
asked
for
my
dead
guy
the
ownwer
knows
me
and
said
i
told
you
you
wouldnt
like
that
beer
they
didnt
charge
me
for
it
that
just
got
the
beer
girl
a
bigger
tip
anybody
that
would
warn
me
against
macro
crap
then
not
charge
me
for
it
when
i
started
coughing
like
bill
the
cat
is
ok
in
my
book
but
this
beer
definitely
is
not
a
disgrace
to
the
michelob
label
not
too
bad
for
a
low
carb
4g
beer
taste
was
pretty
good
didnt
smell
great
though
the
appearance
was
pretty
decent
michelob
invested
a
lot
in
their
new
formula
with
the
type
of
barley
they
use
also
like
the
cover
always
liked
michelobs
design
for
the
bottles
there
has
to
be
something
wrong
with
this
beer
its
skunked
right
that
is
the
major
response
that
i
hear
working
at
an
outdoor
summer
concert
venue
when
poured
after
trying
this
beer
just
now
i
can
honestly
say
i
understand
what
they
mean
in
all
reality
this
beer
is
not
beer
its
a
bastardized
marketing
concept
by
a
conglomerate
of
a
big
business
in
the
brewing
industry
of
a
usa
mass
produced
dumb
down
american
light
lagers
marketed
as
the
low
carbohydrate
light
beer
to
pair
with
the
ongoing
trend
of
the
atkins
diet
so
if
you
ask
me
this
beer
is
going
to
die
just
the
same
as
all
trends
do
and
mark
my
words
if
this
ever
becomes
a
staple
of
the
brewing
industry
of
this
country
i
may
just
find
my
way
to
another
place
smooth
and
refreshing
lager
beer
this
is
false
advertisement
but
here
goes
my
description
pours
quite
a
few
shades
short
of
golden
with
a
highly
carbonated
artificial
fizzy
white
head
leaving
no
lace
sad
looking
aroma
very
mild
hop
aroma
some
sweetness
and
light
cooked
veggie
tones
with
an
nonexisting
aroma
might
as
well
be
carbonated
water
taste
offensive
in
all
regards
tries
to
pass
of
shitty
piss
water
as
a
lager
beer
with
a
harsh
nonrefreshing
cooked
veggie
psuedo
hop
profile
that
i
could
only
pray
would
taste
like
water
instead
of
its
current
form
mouthfeel
is
of
over
carbonated
seltza
water
with
the
drinkability
of
urine
this
beer
poured
a
large
white
frothy
head
with
small
bubbles
that
fully
diminished
there
was
a
lot
of
fizzy
carbonation
in
this
beer
the
body
was
clear
and
the
hue
was
pale
yellow
the
aroma
was
skunky
and
there
was
virtually
no
flavor
to
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
and
thin
low
in
carbs
easy
when
you
get
10
oz
in
the
serving
not
that
it
was
any
great
loss
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
at
least
not
any
worse
than
the
runofthemill
macro
lager
long
on
cooked
cereal
flavors
it
really
struck
me
as
not
being
a
beer
at
all
it
is
a
mere
echo
of
a
beer
and
could
be
called
a
lightly
beerflavored
malt
beverage
in
the
class
with
zima
and
hard
lemonade
if
the
lowcarb
bandwagon
runs
out
of
steam
this
brew
poured
a
large
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
and
a
weak
watery
urine
yellow
colored
body
it
has
a
very
mild
hop
aroma
good
lacing
and
a
watery
and
thin
rice
beer
flavor
no
thanks
glad
to
get
this
one
rated
and
off
my
list
this
brew
was
a
drain
pour
never
again
ok
so
i
compete
in
muay
thai
which
means
i
really
have
to
watch
my
weight
so
i
cant
always
enjoy
that
high
alcohol
stout
or
porter
sometimes
you
have
to
take
one
for
the
team
so
i
figured
id
try
this
low
calories
and
really
low
carbs
whoopdie
doo
i
didnt
pour
it
out
i
figured
it
wouldnt
be
impressive
and
would
just
be
a
waste
of
a
glass
basically
this
stuff
taste
like
seltzer
water
its
fizzy
and
has
really
no
flavor
at
all
i
mean
it
dosnt
even
taste
like
a
light
beer
i
cant
describe
it
because
there
isnt
anything
there
maybe
ill
just
stick
to
good
beer
and
do
more
sit
ups
blah
someone
had
these
on
a
recent
camping
trip
and
i
couldnt
resist
trying
it
pours
a
very
fizzy
clear
clear
yellow
with
an
instantaneously
disappearing
head
no
aroma
to
speak
of
taste
is
watery
cornbeer
like
someone
took
a
coors
light
and
cut
it
with
club
soda
palatable
if
ice
cold
forget
it
if
it
gets
above
40
degrees
i
cant
even
imagine
people
who
like
light
beer
liking
this
crap
what
an
fn
disgrace
edit
i
had
to
lower
the
drinkability
factor
by
a
point
this
this
crap
not
be
drunk
why
was
i
drinking
this
my
uncle
insisted
i
think
i
finished
the
bottle
because
it
was
empty
but
my
stomach
didnt
believe
it
very
very
pale
yellow
with
way
too
many
bubbles
white
head
initally
but
this
is
a
memory
after
the
pour
slight
musty
nose
watery
slightly
sour
musty
malt
taste
tastes
like
overcarbonated
light
beer
that
has
been
filtered
through
a
dirty
old
sock
i
decided
to
give
this
a
try
at
a
work
get
together
where
i
wouldnt
be
stuck
buying
a
whole
six
pack
of
the
stuff
it
poured
a
very
pale
straw
color
and
formed
a
white
foamy
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
quickly
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
grain
with
an
almost
chemical
aspect
to
it
a
flavor
of
grain
the
finish
is
just
too
tartbitteretc
to
really
recommend
this
beer
at
all
pours
an
absolutely
crystalclear
and
exceptionallypale
straw
colored
body
streams
of
standardsized
fastrising
bubbles
are
quite
noticeable
and
help
to
support
its
goodsized
foamy
brightwhite
head
its
retention
is
surprisingly
good
and
it
leaves
a
very
nice
ring
of
lace
at
the
outset
and
then
some
decent
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
leaves
something
to
be
desired
with
a
thin
huskiness
that
detracts
from
its
very
lightly
grainy
malt
note
the
body
is
light
and
the
creamy
head
lends
a
bit
of
softness
to
the
crisp
and
effervescent
carbonation
that
follows
as
it
releases
its
gas
it
becomes
even
softer
and
somewhat
creamy
in
the
mouth
but
its
a
tradeoff
because
the
carbonation
actually
helps
to
enhance
the
flavor
thats
there
the
flavor
is
limited
but
what
else
could
be
expected
of
a
beer
thats
labelled
as
a
low
carbohydrate
light
beer
theres
some
thin
grainy
malt
present
and
its
surprisingly
wellbalanced
by
a
subtle
interwoven
bitterness
yet
it
seems
lacking
it
finishes
almost
without
notice
still
its
clean
and
refreshing
it
might
make
a
good
beer
at
an
outdoor
sporting
event
in
the
summer
but
other
than
that
i
dont
think
it
has
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
throughout
even
one
bottle
taste
lets
see
you
know
if
you
throw
about
an
eighth
of
the
required
mix
into
an
iced
tea
or
lemonade
and
it
tastes
like
funny
water
that
is
what
ultra
is
ultra
low
watery
flavor
a
bit
of
grain
no
hops
really
no
flavor
much
less
flavor
than
flavored
vitamin
waters
for
that
reason
i
can
not
give
it
good
drinkability
because
it
does
not
even
strike
me
as
a
beer
it
is
not
drinkable
as
far
as
flavored
water
goes
wow
i
can
not
believe
people
buy
this
stuff
so
much
settled
in
at
the
tap
corner
of
the
local
cold
cheeseburgers
and
bad
beer
bar
for
a
burger
and
a
beer
so
what
tap
pull
is
right
beside
my
left
arm
mic
ultra
happy
hour
discounts
gotta
try
it
right
big
mistake
this
is
bad
branding
at
its
best
the
ultra
label
has
got
to
mean
something
special
but
not
in
this
case
ultra
pale
with
almost
no
color
whatsoever
no
real
aroma
no
taste
which
is
a
good
thing
considering
that
its
an
ab
no
head
no
lace
this
is
just
ultra
bad
what
the
is
this
really
beer
i
thought
it
was
beer
flavored
water
id
much
rather
drink
water
flavored
water
than
waste
my
time
on
this
beer
beers
like
this
take
the
fun
out
of
drinking
i
drink
beer
because
i
like
beer
not
because
i
want
to
get
drunk
this
is
not
a
beer
made
for
people
who
like
beer
again
yuck
bottom
line
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
that
remains
kochs
golden
anniversary
but
why
drink
it
clear
pale
pale
pale
yellow
thin
foamy
head
hints
of
lace
hints
of
adjuncts
in
the
aroma
tastes
of
um
nothing
seltzer
water
body
mineral
water
soul
there
is
some
slight
graininess
to
give
it
a
ghostly
like
light
beeriness
crisp
and
clean
its
drinkable
but
why
would
you
want
to
drink
this
beer
again
i
swear
i
will
never
drink
this
again
as
long
as
i
live
worse
than
i
expected
a
shameful
concoction
good
lord
whos
idea
was
this
michelob
light
is
decent
but
this
damn
there
is
no
color
no
flavor
no
head
no
good
i
cant
believe
that
this
beer
is
actually
being
touted
as
keeping
the
flavor
i
try
to
find
some
good
in
all
the
beers
i
review
but
this
one
is
impossible
skip
it
and
if
you
are
trying
to
keep
the
calories
and
carbs
down
go
for
miller
lite
as
its
nearly
the
same
levels
cheaper
and
tastes
better
lose
the
carbs
not
the
taste
what
taste
michelob
ultra
has
practically
no
taste
except
for
its
finish
color
is
an
extremely
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
barely
exists
except
for
some
malt
and
alcohol
extremely
thin
and
watereddown
mouthfeel
the
taste
was
kind
of
like
seltzer
with
the
slightest
malt
flavor
in
the
finish
despite
the
low
carbs
if
i
had
to
resort
to
a
lite
beer
id
rather
have
sam
adams
light
even
miller
lite
tastes
better
than
this
and
thats
not
saying
much
a
boring
and
bland
dietbeer
that
will
initially
sell
as
people
are
sucked
into
the
hype
of
drinking
a
healthy
alcoholic
beverage
ive
got
nothing
new
to
add
to
whats
been
said
already
the
only
reason
i
didnt
give
it
lower
scores
on
taste
and
smell
is
because
that
it
contains
nothing
patently
offensive
its
just
bland
tasteless
and
odorless
for
the
most
part
it
got
a
slightly
higher
drinkability
score
because
go
figure
it
goes
down
like
water
i
cant
imagine
that
anyone
who
spends
much
time
on
this
site
will
find
this
product
worth
his
or
her
time
incredibly
pale
golden
color
strongly
resembles
seltzer
water
quite
lively
carbonation
with
a
decent
snowwhite
head
good
broken
lace
aroma
is
quite
clean
perhaps
because
there
is
almost
nothing
there
just
some
faint
malt
taste
begins
with
a
little
sting
of
carbonation
and
a
washed
out
corn
grits
flavor
even
that
disappears
quickly
there
is
perhaps
a
ghost
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
a
remarkably
insubstantial
beer
michelob
ultra
can
best
be
described
as
watered
down
michelob
light
which
is
in
turn
watered
down
michelob
they
all
share
the
base
flavor
which
is
something
considering
that
other
lite
beers
often
share
no
taste
in
common
with
their
regular
versions
e
g
bud
light
and
bud
michelob
ultra
pours
to
give
one
of
the
lightest
golden
beers
i
have
ever
seen
it
hardly
looks
like
beer
there
is
a
faint
aroma
of
malt
the
taste
is
extremely
thin
imagine
a
glass
of
club
soda
with
a
shot
of
beer
added
there
is
almost
no
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thin
not
bad
but
just
like
water
the
drinkability
is
minimal
there
is
not
a
horrible
taste
but
just
an
almost
complete
lack
of
reason
to
want
to
drink
this
beer
somebody
help
me
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
with
alomost
no
head
not
much
for
aroma
and
the
taste
was
barely
there
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
pound
for
a
party
this
could
be
what
you
are
looking
for
there
is
a
reason
why
1
0
on
our
score
here
equals
awful
this
beer
offers
almost
nothing
that
i
can
constructively
critique
there
is
no
aroma
whatsoever
aside
from
some
remnants
of
fermentation
i
suppose
however
there
is
some
hint
of
flavor
at
the
very
onset
of
the
sip
but
that
quickly
dissippates
into
a
bitter
and
bordering
on
nasty
taste
that
is
not
even
including
the
aftertaste
i
know
beer
makers
have
to
try
to
remain
on
the
cutting
edge
but
the
only
thing
that
is
being
cut
after
drinking
this
brew
is
wind
virtually
no
head
faint
dilute
yellow
color
zero
aroma
almost
no
taste
possibly
hints
of
cooked
veggies
no
hops
curiosity
let
me
down
pale
light
yellow
color
fizzy
white
head
not
much
aromachemical
like
seltzer
water
clean
but
no
flavor
sad
ab
has
to
resort
to
this
i
guess
this
one
is
for
ultra
fitness
freaks
that
shave
their
chest
i
gave
this
one
the
lowest
rating
i
would
much
rather
drink
water
it
really
sucks
resorted
to
this
at
a
holiday
party
when
all
the
decent
beer
was
gone
it
was
in
a
big
galvanized
tub
of
ice
and
was
exceedingly
cold
which
was
probably
a
blessing
i
drink
macroswill
so
infrequently
that
i
am
truly
shocked
when
i
encounter
one
this
beer
comes
from
a
marketing
company
that
pretends
that
it
makes
beer
no
color
no
head
no
mouthfeel
no
taste
no
point
to
it
at
all
avoid
it
at
all
cost
even
if
its
free
had
the
misfourtune
of
tasting
this
swill
a
light
beer
drinking
friend
offered
me
a
bottle
and
not
being
one
to
turn
away
free
beer
regardless
of
how
bad
it
is
i
agreed
wish
i
never
agreed
one
word
comes
to
mind
when
consuming
this
beer
water
no
head
to
speak
of
no
hop
presence
not
anything
while
this
beer
deserved
ones
across
the
board
i
gave
its
drinkability
a
1
5
simply
because
i
can
see
how
these
could
be
drank
rather
quickly
something
that
might
appeal
to
the
college
crowd
or
to
someone
looking
for
a
quick
buzz
this
is
either
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
or
one
of
the
best
seltzer
waters
maybe
i
would
try
it
again
if
i
had
a
stubborn
stain
on
my
clothes
keep
drinking
it
to
lose
weight
people
light
clouded
yelow
color
has
a
sour
taste
but
other
than
that
it
has
no
taste
i
am
an
athletic
guy
who
has
no
need
to
watch
carbs
if
i
did
i
would
drink
this
because
after
2
sips
you
want
to
stop
drinking
period
i
guess
thats
the
point
of
this
crap
happy
drinking
folks
the
only
upside
of
it
would
be
it
would
be
refreshing
it
you
had
just
mowed
the
lawn
and
wanted
a
very
light
chugging
beer
but
then
you
shouldnt
be
drinking
beer
and
should
be
drinking
watet
this
should
not
be
called
beer
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
stuff
is
probably
going
to
be
the
next
beer
fad
see
dry
beer
ice
beer
etc
this
stuff
isnt
repulsive
but
the
taste
just
isnt
there
easy
to
chug
but
that
would
ruin
its
dietary
purpose
wouldnt
it
verdict
just
another
watery
light
beer
i
was
actually
dumbfounded
about
how
bad
this
was
is
this
a
gimmick
or
will
it
stick
around
as
can
be
expected
the
color
is
straw
the
head
is
nonexistant
and
the
taste
is
corn
ive
had
seltzer
water
with
more
character
than
michelob
ultra
michelob
its
not
my
idea
of
ultra
it
reminds
me
of
a
pabst
na
i
used
to
drink
that
means
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
most
likely
with
the
ladies
or
folks
who
really
watch
those
calories
and
are
willing
to
make
do
the
carbonation
is
very
high
it
births
a
very
fizzy
short
lived
head
with
no
lace
or
film
the
color
is
gold
but
looks
flat
and
watery
soon
truth
is
dont
let
the
beer
sit
and
go
do
something
else
because
it
does
flattenout
very
quickly
this
is
not
a
beer
this
is
barely
even
a
malt
beverage
it
has
the
color
and
carbonation
of
champagne
a
wineycheap
champagne
nose
a
mouthfeel
similar
to
mineral
water
and
virtually
no
taste
it
even
feels
like
water
as
it
settles
into
in
my
stomach
thats
just
not
right
when
you
can
actually
smell
the
alcohol
in
a
low
alcohol
beer

same
as

for

store
brew
it
aint
friggin
beer
it
is
so
devoid
of
taste
that
it
will
actually
help
sales
of
beers
like
sam
adams
light
lite
beer
drinkers
will
eschew
this
tasteless
ultra
crap
en
masse
and
ask
the
barkeep
for
a
light
beer
with
flavor
then
they
will
taste
the

howl
uncontrollably
and
cause
some
poor
guy
to
get
a
dart
planted
in
his

whew
very
pale
slighly
greenish
color
only
becks
light
is
paler
in
my
experience
terrible
head
gone
in
10
seconds
not
much
of
a
sense
of
aroma
to
all
a
little
bit
of
grassy
pea
pod
sense
gassy
as
all
get
out
fizzy
from
beginning
to
the
stomach
vague
quianine
water
flavor
slight
artificial
lemon
slight
metallics
very
unidimensional
from
front
to
back
to
me
this
brew
is
an
abomination
though
it
might
make
a
good
base
for
a
cheapass
punch
at
a
frat
party
sorry
cant
recommend
even
within
style
notes
can
beer
get
any
lighter
than
this
is
this
the
base
product
for
the
production
of
malternative
this
is
light
beer
so
light
there
is
nothing
there
people
who
seek
this
beer
out
are
people
with
boring
beer
palates
there
are
better
light
beers
out
there
even
then
what
is
the
point
i
compare
this
beer
with
baked
fat
free
light
nacho
chips
its
like
eating
air
whats
the
point
dont
even
bother
with
this
one
as
it
is
the
most
lackluster
boring
gimmicky
brew
of
its
time
this
one
was
pale
it
actually
looked
like
it
was
50
beer
50
water
the
only
thing
it
smelled
like
to
me
was
raw
string
beans
hmmm
the
foam
hung
in
there
for
a
little
bit
maybe
30
seconds
and
it
kinda
looked
like
it
would
form
a
rocky
white
head
i
was
wrong
and
it
fell
flat
to
nearly
nothing
a
few
seconds
later
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
mainly
cereal
no
real
hops
to
speak
of
here
i
noticed
an
ever
so
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
a
minute
bit
of
bittering
hops
would
have
this
beer
binish
dry
which
wouldnt
be
as
bad
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
by
no
means
would
i
ever
stock
my
fridge
with
this
this
could
be
the
clearest
beer
i
have
ever
drank
more
reminiscent
of
champagne
in
the
glass
pours
out
to
a
nearly
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
a
funny
cooked
veggie
aroma
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
virutally
no
aftertaste
no
hops
or
malt
presence
at
all
tastes
very
very
similar
to
miller
lite
very
watered
down
with
no
body
whatsoever
i
agreed
with
my
roomatebuddy
who
is
currently
passed
out
on
the
couch
to
fairly
review
all
the
ab
products
that
he
loves
as
long
he
buys
or
they
are
freebies
here
it
goes
transparent
faint
yellow
color
yeilds
an
overly
bubbly
head
that
leaves
in
a
hurry
smell
is
mostly
grainy
and
metallic
the
only
beer
flavor
is
a
faint
sour
stale
finish
and
aftertaste
like
the
stale
beers
you
would
sneak
out
of
your
dads
supply
in
high
school
excessively
thin
even
for
a
light
beer
cant
get
over
the
metallicgrainy
whiff
easy
to
down
but
not
enjoyable
at
all
the
biggest
impression
is
the
overall
lack
of
any
positive
beerlike
flavors
i
used
to
drink
michelob
light
before
i
knew
what
good
beer
was
this
is
a
decent
marketing
job
but
a
lousy
beer
even
for
a
light
beer
which
should
always
be
judged
on
a
different
scale
since
they
will
never
compare
with
a
good
nonlight
style
this
is
just
terrible
i
had
some
degree
of
hope
since
they
put
it
out
under
the
michelob
name
and
not
budweiser
but
this
is
as
bad
as
beer
gets
unless
your
dietician
is
against
any
form
of
beer
because
of
high
carbs
and
theyll
let
ya
slide
with
this
stay
away
from
it
michelob
ultra
the
ultra
low
carbohydrate
beer
from
ab
its
in
a
standard
michelob
12
ounce
bottle
but
with
an
over
the
top
color
scheme
that
well
be
seeing
on
a
nascar
any
day
now
cant
figure
out
why
ab
is
using
michelob
for
this
and
not
bud
but
the
michelob
name
has
lost
all
credibility
with
me
anyhow
the
beer
is
about
as
youd
expect
pale
looking
macrolager
adjuncty
aroma
with
a
more
pronounced
chemical
smell
aggressive
carbonation
if
it
had
any
flavor
it
was
wiped
away
by
those
scrubbing
bubbles
marketing
came
up
with
this
one
and
it
tastes
like
it
i
dont
understand
what
theyre
trying
to
do
with
this
outlier
detected
this
beer
is
aweful
please
terrible
taste
tried
to
hard
to
be
a
girly
drink
tastes
like
death
its
a
drinkable
cheap
beer
for
a
cook
out
i
like
it
better
than
most
big
box
american
beers
with
that
being
said
its
nothing
special
but
i
buy
it
for
my
wife
from
time
to
time
ok
for
after
mowing
the
lawn
not
sure
why
i
like
this
beer
but
i
honestly
enjoy
it
from
time
to
time
stuck
in
a
midwest
bar
with
the
wife
i
think
it
comes
from
the
practice
of
my
grandparents
adding
lime
and
salt
to
corornas
loved
that
bud
light
lime
seems
to
nail
that
taste
for
me
how
have
i
never
rated
this
it
was
my
second
lawnmower
beer
after
landshark
cans
disappeared
what
can
i
say
its
a
lime
beer
nose
of
fake
lime
barely
a
bit
of
beer
taste
under
that
big
fake
lime
taste
that
seemingly
never
leaves
the
tongue
ive
moved
on
to
the
various
leinekugel
shandys
now
for
mowing
but
yep
many
a
strip
of
grass
were
doused
with
the
last
ounce
or
so
of
a
bud
light
lime
once
the
cold
fell
off
really
only
way
to
drink
it
is
ice
freaking
cold
think
just
north
of
slushy
cold
another
solid
example
these
guys
cant
brew
a
good
beer
love
the
noticeable
line
taste
better
than
miller
chill
just
plain
aweful
this
beer
shouldnt
be
produced
o
nothing
that
is
gonna
knock
your
sox
off
but
a
refreshing
offering
that
would
be
good
to
bring
a
12
pack
of
to
the
beach
crisp
and
citrus
flavors
make
it
an
average
beer
yummy
crisp
lime
soda
drink
still
awful
but
better
than
the
original
artificial
lime
quality
over
the
watery
body
flavor
profile
smelled
like
lime
taste
a
little
disappointing
not
undrinkable
ok
with
a
lime
i
would
unfortunately
rather
have
a
corona
with
lime
than
this
what
can
i
say
but
bud
light
lager
with
lime
added
its
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
but
the
lime
really
taste
generic
and
if
i
am
going
to
add
lime
to
beer
i
would
much
rather
add
real
lime
i
feel
bad
even
rating
this
super
gross
i
dont
like
fruited
beers
especially
favored
artificially
looks
great
way
to
much
lime
but
still
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
i
mean
for
what
it
is
pretty
good
it
tastes
like
soap
not
completely
sure
the
brand
of
soap
but
probably
ivory
i
dont
see
how
people
like
it
im
sure
cold
bath
water
tastes
smooth
but
its
not
really
a
good
taste
very
sessionable
the
lime
flavor
hides
the
alcohol
taste
in
this
beer
that
is
forward
in
bud
light
had
this
at
my
buddys
birthday
party
not
a
lot
of
flavor
worth
mentioning
the
lime
tastes
like
real
lime
but
is
a
light
dash
of
it
i
give
this
a
5
out
of
5
for
one
reason
it
tastes
incredibly
smooth
and
goes
down
really
good
carbonation
is
perfect
for
this
beer
you
could
argue
its
not
beer
considering
there
is
no
beer
flavor
really
besides
a
light
malt
taste
this
stuff
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
it
actually
stays
easy
to
drink
even
warm
because
of
that
i
also
rated
this
beer
highly
it
is
seriously
the
easiest
thing
to
drink
i
have
ever
had
the
fact
its
so
easy
to
drink
i
drank
almost
a
24
pack
of
bottles
by
myself
across
the
day
the
lime
is
just
the
perfect
amount
i
am
not
a
beer
snob
at
all
but
i
do
enjoy
the
hoppier
stuff
too
i
gotta
say
they
dont
market
this
as
much
as
regular
bl
and
i
dont
think
they
have
too
this
is
good
without
marketing
its
just
the
perfect
balance
of
the
lime
flavor
and
the
light
body
of
the
beer
taste
that
makes
me
like
this
next
time
i
go
fishing
im
taking
a
pack
of
this
perfect
for
hot
days
i
personally
love
this
beer
perfect
for
hot
days
overall
very
refreshing
and
palatable
nice
and
refreshing
good
really
really
chilled
bud
light
with
a
little
lime
taste
not
to
overpowering
good
american
version
of
corona
with
no
skunk
smell
excellent
lake
beer
no
real
reason
for
this
beer
that
i
can
think
of
they
should
just
stop
making
bud
lite
products
altogether
this
beer
tastes
and
smells
like
the
moldy
piss
on
the
floor
of
your
local
mexican
cantina
restaurantbar
in
fact
im
really
not
sure
this
was
beer
at
all
it
has
such
a
low
abv
good
luck
trying
to
get
a
buzz
on
this
garbage
bud
take
a
look
at
what
dogfish
is
doing
with
their
ancient
ales
line
they
at
least
taste
good
and
get
me
a
buzz
i
like
it
its
a
guilty
pleasure
just
bad
and
artificial
tasting
bud
light
lime
25
appearance
was
a
very
pale
yellow
with
no
head
smell
was
full
of
lime
but
also
kind
of
a
chemical
scent
the
taste
was
a
bud
light
with
artificial
lime
flavor
added
thats
kind
of
all
there
is
to
it
good
beer
for
the
beach
if
youre
not
trying
to
spend
too
much
or
if
craft
beer
isnt
available
that
is
the
only
time
drinking
bud
is
even
remotely
acceptable
go
with
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
or
blonde
ale
instead
i
am
someone
who
enjoys
light
beer
reason
its
smooth
and
goes
down
like
water
this
has
no
real
flavor
worth
mentioning
besides
a
slight
beer
taste
and
lime
its
very
balanced
in
the
carbonation
i
like
this
more
than
my
coors
light
coors
light
is
in
the
same
boat
as
this
though
what
made
me
rate
this
this
way
is
the
hint
of
lime
its
not
overpowering
and
today
i
had
two
or
3
of
these
and
they
were
good
as
i
said
the
only
thing
i
can
taste
is
the
lime
also
its
one
of
the
few
things
i
let
get
hot
and
it
didnt
turn
nasty
this
and
redds
apple
ale
trump
all
the
other
macros
for
me
overall
terrible
i
enjoy
many
fruit
flavored
beers
but
this
is
god
awful
tastes
chemically
to
me
would
i
recommend
it
honestly
good
question
i
will
say
a
small
yes
but
only
during
summer
as
a
try
for
appearance
it
is
very
hard
for
a
beer
to
appear
bad
thats
why
it
gets
a
4
that
is
where
the
high
marks
end
the
smell
has
a
very
faint
lime
smell
to
it
and
is
the
only
think
you
can
smell
from
the
beer
the
taste
is
just
lime
and
nothing
more
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
is
like
drinking
a
bud
light
overall
the
beer
isnt
good
i
wanted
to
try
it
as
a
beach
beer
and
is
low
in
abv
and
comes
in
cans
it
gave
me
slight
hard
burn
and
is
like
drinking
a
watered
down
corona
overall
i
have
to
remind
myself
to
respect
beer
at
this
moment
i
understand
this
beer
is
popular
with
frat
boys
but
its
not
for
me
this
beer
would
appeal
to
people
who
are
trying
beer
for
the
first
time
and
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
it
would
also
appeal
to
people
who
do
not
really
like
beer
it
tasted
more
like
a
soft
drink
than
beer
its
a
decent
beer
when
you
take
it
for
what
it
is
these
types
of
beer
have
their
place
its
not
a
craft
beer
or
a
microbrew
and
it
doesnt
need
to
be
for
a
hot
day
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
pretty
good
still
not
as
good
or
as
cheap
as
high
life
which
is
my
go
to
filler
beer
the
bud
light
lime
is
actually
a
good
beer
it
is
like
a
bud
light
with
lime
flavor
added
to
it
tou
can
actually
taste
the
lime
flavor
on
the
beer
the
color
is
like
a
clear
golden
color
the
smell
pf
the
beer
is
actually
pretty
good
as
well
for
an
every
day
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
this
is
your
typical
taste
look
and
aroma
what
i
think
sets
this
one
apart
is
the
lime
flavor
that
is
added
the
line
is
more
natural
than
fake
and
adds
great
improvement
to
the
bud
lite
itself
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
beer
very
cold
because
as
the
temperature
rises
the
flavor
becomes
slightly
skunky
and
undesirable
keep
it
cold
and
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beverage
this
is
an
okay
summer
boating
beer
thats
watery
mouthfeel
actually
lends
itself
to
its
drinkability
on
a
hot
summer
day
out
on
the
boat
i
think
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
a
fuller
bodied
beer
would
fill
you
up
though
any
other
time
not
the
greatest
beer
pours
a
small
head
if
you
are
a
fan
of
drinking
beer
with
a
lime
in
it
you
may
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
an
alright
alternative
than
actually
cutting
a
lime
and
sticking
it
into
your
beer
i
would
say
it
is
more
for
the
summer
so
crack
one
open
on
a
hot
summer
day
my
buddy
drinks
this
for
breakfast
at
the
spring
bristol
race
and
i
took
a
hit
was
gut
wrenching
no
matter
what
time
of
day
i
would
rate
this
less
than
1
0
if
available
this
barely
qualifies
as
beer
to
begin
with
what
little
taste
there
is
to
be
had
is
a
disgusting
slightly
lime
taste
that
leaves
a
horrible
tangy
feeling
in
your
mouth
afterwards
the
rest
is
just
watery
the
massive
carbonation
attempts
to
hide
the
fact
that
this
beer
literally
tastes
like
urine
but
fails
completely
to
do
so
everything
about
this
beer
is
unpleasant
and
i
am
genuinely
amazed
that
anyone
buys
it
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
beer
its
an
alcoholic
lime
drink
bud
light
lime
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
there
is
little
to
no
head
to
this
brew
but
it
is
white
head
this
beer
smells
like
7
up
or
other
lemon
lime
pop
or
soda
on
the
market
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
but
flat
lemon
lime
pop
or
soda
i
thought
there
would
be
more
to
this
brew
but
there
is
not
if
you
like
lemon
lime
soda
or
pop
you
my
like
this
nothing
special
about
this
brew
over
all
im
giving
this
brew
a
2
5
out
of
5
o
had
this
with
homemade
mexican
food
and
it
wasnt
that
bad
i
could
see
this
at
the
right
price
of
course
as
being
a
great
lawnmower
or
other
manual
labor
on
a
hot
day
type
beer
the
low
alcohol
content
certainly
makes
it
a
candidate
for
mass
consumption
but
i
have
to
wonder
if
youd
tire
of
the
lime
flavor
is
lime
that
hard
to
cut
this
just
doesnt
seem
like
much
of
an
added
value
ive
lived
in
cold
climates
and
lime
is
still
available
pretty
much
year
round
no
matter
how
awful
the
fruit
looks
its
gotta
be
better
than
what
bud
or
inbev
synthesizes
otonight
is
light
lager
night
i
like
the
idea
that
real
limes
are
used
with
this
beer
so
it
is
a
bud
light
that
has
real
limes
in
it
i
have
to
say
it
taste
better
with
e
lime
in
it
this
is
not
an
abomination
in
some
ways
its
actually
more
interesting
than
bud
light
while
bud
light
has
no
flavor
this
at
least
has
some
lime
above
all
im
curious
why
this
beer
still
exists
does
this
appeal
to
people
looking
for
that
omg
drinking
corona
with
lime
is
like
im
really
on
the
beach
demographic
i
wish
that
demographic
didnt
exist
on
a
related
note
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
corona
lime
or
not
or
does
this
appeal
to
the
im
underage
and
i
dont
like
beer
but
this
doesnt
taste
like
beer
lol
crowd
whatever
one
thing
is
certain
i
now
really
need
to
review
the
masterpiece
known
as
bud
light
limearita
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
but
this
was
my
first
time
rating
it
it
wasnt
too
bad
i
have
to
say
dare
i
say
i
enjoyed
it
i
understand
some
people
may
like
this
kind
of
stuff
i
am
not
one
of
them
the
lime
flavor
in
bll
is
overpowering
and
its
not
too
bad
it
does
taste
like
lime
not
too
artificial
drinking
bll
is
definitely
not
a
deep
beerdrinking
experience
but
if
i
ever
do
want
something
cheap
or
something
to
just
get
me
a
little
drunker
it
is
one
of
the
first
things
i
will
reach
for
although
because
the
flavor
is
so
strong
its
tough
to
have
a
lot
of
it
in
one
go
but
i
suppose
once
youre
drunk
enough
you
can
get
a
regular
cheapo
lager
and
not
tell
the
difference
when
you
pour
milk
in
your
fruitloops
and
eat
all
the
fruitloops
you
have
fruity
milk
left
over
to
drink
when
you
pour
bud
light
in
your
fruitloops
and
eat
all
your
fruitloops
you
have
bud
light
lime
left
to
drink
i
know
a
lot
of
very
smart
and
respectable
people
who
really
like
this
brew
but
im
not
one
of
the
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
not
much
to
say
about
the
smell
average
some
sort
of
limeish
scent
nothing
special
at
all
taste
was
okay
at
first
but
seemed
very
artificial
and
became
far
too
overpowering
after
a
few
drinks
was
expecting
a
subtle
lime
taste
but
definitely
not
the
case
here
awful
not
sure
if
the
can
had
something
to
do
with
this
but
ill
possibly
have
to
review
this
again
later
after
trying
it
in
a
bottle
sampled
on
9113
chilled
down
to
36
degrees
in
my
beer
cooler
poured
into
a
pool
ball
pilsner
glass
pours
a
goldenyellow
with
a
small
foamy
head
very
little
lacing
was
seen
lots
of
bubbles
were
seen
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
due
to
excessive
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
some
grain
and
lime
the
taste
is
of
mostly
lime
which
covers
up
the
grain
flavor
actually
a
bit
much
and
more
so
that
the
miller
chill
that
i
had
earlier
was
waterdown
and
doesnt
taste
like
real
lime
this
beer
is
pretty
terrible
if
you
can
call
it
beer
it
smells
like
laundry
soap
seriously
that
is
the
first
thing
i
thought
when
i
smelled
it
its
light
and
fizzy
like
most
other
american
mass
produced
beers
its
about
as
smooth
as
water
if
you
call
that
smooth
the
feel
is
very
crisp
from
all
the
carbonation
and
is
super
easy
the
problem
on
feel
is
that
it
carries
the
unnatural
lime
sourness
through
the
taste
i
like
it
better
than
bud
light
the
lime
does
add
a
refreshing
character
to
it
the
lime
flavor
can
get
cloying
so
i
would
only
drink
as
a
palate
cleanser
this
drink
is
all
lime
in
aroma
and
flavor
almost
candylike
as
it
doesnt
have
a
natural
lime
tartnesssourness
its
a
touch
syrupy
no
malt
or
hop
character
at
all
since
when
did
miller
lite
change
their
name
to
bud
light
lime
was
there
suppose
to
be
lime
flavor
in
it
because
it
had
not
even
a
hint
of
lime
but
enough
about
that
its
not
bad
but
ill
just
order
a
miller
lite
next
time
i
go
to
that
restaurant
pours
clear
yellow
color
with
2
finger
width
carbonated
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
virtually
nonexistent
lime
predominates
the
aroma
nothing
special
there
very
light
malty
taste
up
front
followed
by
a
watered
down
limeade
aftertaste
and
spicy
bitterness
light
and
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
by
the
pool
but
there
are
literally
thousands
of
better
beers
for
this
overall
for
what
it
is
this
does
the
job
id
rather
be
drinking
one
of
these
than
the
traditional
corona
and
lime
during
a
party
or
something
primarily
because
the
effect
is
basically
the
same
and
this
one
is
cheaper
a
good
party
drink
if
youre
having
lots
of
people
over
who
dont
like
beerbeer
not
something
id
pick
up
on
my
own
but
for
what
it
is
its
refreshing
and
dangerously
drinkable
but
not
in
a
traditional
beer
kind
of
way
more
like
a
soda
or
hardlemonade
thats
bitter
sort
of
way
overall
a
well
crafted
beer
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
the
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
lime
is
good
neither
overpower
the
aftertaste
of
lime
is
also
a
nice
touch
i
was
happily
surprised
by
the
brew
it
will
be
good
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
d
this
beer
certainly
surprised
me
i
am
not
a
fan
of
bud
light
but
this
seems
to
cover
up
the
off
flavors
with
a
moderately
enjoyable
lime
characteristic
if
i
was
going
to
drink
a
lot
of
beers
on
a
summer
day
i
wouldnt
mind
this
being
one
or
two
of
them
this
isnt
good
but
you
probably
expected
that
this
beer
is
just
plain
nasty
the
taste
is
just
horrible
the
beer
taste
its
kinda
sour
in
my
opinion
and
it
has
a
bitter
taste
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
bud
light
is
bad
enough
but
who
ever
decided
to
add
lime
should
be
fired
my
advice
avoid
and
save
your
money
o
for
light
beers
its
an
interesting
spin
very
drinkable
maybe
nice
for
hot
weather
or
a
barbeque
for
the
style
i
would
say
its
maybe
a
bit
above
avg
for
all
beer
its
just
a
bit
to
artificial
and
dull
i
feel
like
ive
tasted
it
before
in
other
light
beers
piss
colored
appearance
smell
is
over
the
top
of
pale
lager
and
artificial
lime
juice
no
complexity
and
has
adjunct
pale
lager
written
all
over
it
mouthfeel
is
so
quick
and
bubbly
and
dry
in
the
worst
way
this
is
one
for
the
women
stay
away
at
all
cost
overall
an
average
beer
good
for
social
occasions
but
i
wouldnt
drink
this
for
the
taste
very
meh
on
a
budget
this
is
my
pick
i
understand
it
goes
against
what
i
believe
a
beer
should
be
made
out
of
or
even
taste
like
but
i
am
obsessed
with
lime
so
this
was
my
choice
at
bars
otherwise
id
rather
not
choose
an
anheuserbusch
beer
at
all
the
only
beef
i
have
about
this
beer
is
it
is
more
than
likely
processed
with
high
fructose
corn
syrup
give
it
a
shot
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
ball
game
or
other
out
door
event
o
fruit
in
beer
seems
to
be
something
people
do
whenever
they
dont
like
beer
because
all
theyve
ever
had
is
the
fizzy
yellow
stuff
nothing
against
them
i
feel
like
most
beer
geeks
were
bmc
consumers
first
but
im
not
a
fan
imagine
that
o
much
better
than
regular
bud
light
im
not
sure
why
i
liked
it
as
much
as
i
did
probably
because
i
was
super
thirsty
but
it
hit
the
spot
o
for
what
it
is
this
is
actually
not
bad
at
all
no
real
adjunct
flavors
or
aromas
probably
masked
by
the
lime
which
makes
this
rather
easy
to
drink
especially
given
the
fact
that
it
is
4
2
and
doesnt
have
too
many
beerlike
qualities
i
guess
that
might
be
the
problem
though
no
beer
qualities
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
hue
with
an
average
head
mainly
because
i
pour
this
as
viciously
as
possible
to
get
a
head
some
cheap
grains
and
lime
are
evident
in
the
scent
drinks
fairly
weakly
with
very
little
volume
or
texture
at
least
it
lives
up
to
the
lime
name
and
has
a
decent
lime
flavor
leaves
a
slight
lime
after
taste
and
thats
about
it
a
glorified
version
of
what
i
refer
to
as
beer
flavored
water
overall
good
drink
for
a
hot
summer
day
if
you
want
something
fruity
with
a
slight
kick
2

d
calling
bud
light
a
beer
is
a
stretch
but
this
can
and
never
should
be
called
beer
it
shouldnt
even
be
allowed
to
be
reviewed
on
this
site
drink
this
if
you
are
burnt
out
on
beer
i
guess
surprisingly
a
better
alternative
to
bud
light
at
least
this
one
tastes
like
something
the
lime
flavor
is
very
obviously
artificial
like
a
diet
soda
so
its
maybe
not
as
tasty
as
a
corona
with
lime
added
but
its
something
you
can
stomach
the
carbonation
has
a
nice
bite
which
really
helps
the
style
if
youre
stuck
between
bud
light
or
bud
light
lime
and
the
water
is
bad
this
is
the
obvious
choice
cheers
all
in
all
not
bad
but
the
title
says
all
a
light
big
company
beer
with
flavor
added
bud
light
lime
is
less
of
a
beer
and
more
of
a
liquified
lime
jolly
rancher
with
a
touch
of
beer
flavor
it
would
be
refreshing
in
the
summer
in
fact
i
just
finished
a
5k
in
91
degree
heat
but
the
artificial
lime
flavor
is
just
too
much
this
was
given
to
me
for
helping
my
professor
move
and
i
would
not
partake
in
it
again
unless
under
similar
circumstances
o
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
evening
this
is
actually
a
better
version
of
bud
light
and
tastes
like
a
bud
light
with
a
shot
of
roses
lime
syrup
this
beer
is
best
when
ice
cold
so
there
you
have
it
next
time
you
want
bud
light
look
and
see
if
they
have
bud
light
lime
its
just
a
pinch
better
it
went
down
easier
than
expected
but
still
something
that
came
from
a
party
cooler
and
not
as
a
result
of
a
conscious
choice
to
purchase
this
not
all
offensive
just
not
very
good
color
was
deep
piss
yellow
terrible
less
than
half
finger
head
that
dissipated
faster
than
i
could
blink
tasted
like
a
diet
soda
water
and
lime
just
plain
terrible
overall
at
least
miller
chill
had
taste
although
a
bad
one
it
was
still
better
than
this
travesty
wow
this
sucks
id
take
a
corona
light
with
lime
any
day
of
the
week
over
this
originally
reviewed
07062011
overall
actually
this
is
much
better
than
i
was
anticipating
it
had
a
lot
more
flavor
while
most
in
lime
it
was
a
lot
more
flavor
then
the
average
light
beer
its
amazing
how
a
single
additional
flavor
into
an
otherwise
shitty
beer
can
change
things
i
cannot
power
through
bud
light
and
actually
enjoy
it
the
addition
of
lime
and
salt
flavoring
really
takes
this
stuff
from
an
bad
watered
down
redneck
lager
to
something
that
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
although
i
dont
prefer
it
to
lets
say
labatt
blue
it
still
is
not
a
bad
choice
although
i
typically
dont
like
paying
22
for
an
18
pack
of
this
when
i
can
get
labatt
for
less
o
this
beer
goes
down
like
water
and
somewhat
resembles
limeflavored
soda
except
that
it
lacks
a
strong
sugary
sweetness
this
beverage
is
probably
best
consumed
very
quickly
and
in
the
can
o
lives
up
to
my
nonexistent
expectations
but
i
can
manage
these
little
7
oz
bottles
to
an
extent
its
not
completely
awful
if
you
go
into
it
expecting
a
lime
soda
instead
of
an
actual
beer
me
ill
stick
with
actual
craft
beer
thank
you
very
much
overall
this
is
more
of
a
fruit
and
spices
beer
than
an
adjunct
lager
not
good
but
the
lime
hides
the
bad
stuff
95
degrees
outside
and
95
humidity
want
some
beer
this
is
an
excellent
choice
thin
yes
refreshing
hell
yes
zero
hops
weiss
no
refreshing
hell
yes
cmon
its
in
a
clear
bottle
not
sure
why
this
is
advertised
any
season
other
than
summer
and
its
kinda
good
with
summer
food
like
bbq
looks
like
any
other
macro
smells
and
tastes
heavily
of
lime
and
some
hints
of
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
prickly
overally
dont
go
into
this
expecting
greatness
you
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
i
think
the
reviews
are
way
too
low
remember
compare
this
to
miller
lite
chill
that
is
all
this
beer
is
not
my
type
the
color
is
a
yellow
straw
and
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
hint
of
lime
there
just
isnt
much
taste
to
it
its
very
bland
and
watery
this
seems
like
a
girly
drink
to
me
let
them
enjoy
it
if
anything
stick
with
a
regular
bud
light
will
never
drink
again
you
can
tell
how
this
beer
looks
if
you
have
ever
seen
a
bud
product
it
is
like
that
in
a
clear
bottle
smells
like
lager
and
a
bit
of
lime
air
freshener
flavor
is
adjunctional
and
has
a
strong
lime
character
while
cold
the
lime
is
a
little
sharp
and
as
the
beer
warms
it
actually
comes
out
a
bit
more
thin
with
insane
carbonation
and
a
semi
dry
finish
this
beer
is
poorly
done
but
i
cant
help
but
enjoy
it
when
out
on
the
lake
in
an
intertube
o
not
horrible
but
tastes
more
like
a
soft
drink
than
a
beer
good
for
those
who
dont
really
like
beer
and
need
something
sweeter
id
probably
look
elsewhere
if
this
was
a
choice
bud
light
lime
is
much
more
flavorful
than
normal
bud
light
it
has
the
taste
of
limes
and
sugar
with
a
malty
backdrop
this
flavored
light
lager
is
popular
and
i
see
why
the
mild
taste
of
this
brew
will
not
satisfy
hop
lovers
but
should
be
a
welcomed
alternative
for
fans
of
the
original
bud
light
had
out
of
the
bottle
smells
like
sweet
artificial
lime
flavoring
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
really
light
body
and
seltzery
carbonation
i
would
hardly
consider
this
beer
but
to
be
honest
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
one
bit
on
a
hot
summer
day
george
the
feel
is
a
little
sad
i
expect
light
and
it
is
crisp
whats
weird
is
that
it
watery
yet
somehow
also
slick
what
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
pop
flavors
flavors
and
aromas
but
i
couldnt
find
the
beer
in
this
f
o
this
is
like
drinking
lime
juice
mixed
with
cheap
mineral
water
im
trying
to
find
something
positive
to
say
here
but
honestly
just
cant
do
it
this
is
atrocious
its
a
sad
excuse
for
a
beer
but
fortunately
for
me
i
expected
no
less
my
first
drain
pour
in
some
time
this
beer
is
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
lime
aroma
that
almost
hides
a
hint
of
rice
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
onedimensional
all
lime
its
not
overpowering
but
thats
all
there
is
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bud
light
lime
is
a
bad
beer
not
recommended
this
is
a
solid
c
from
me
sure
i
would
never
order
it
at
the
bar
but
when
hanging
out
with
buds
or
similar
activities
this
is
the
perfect
beer
in
my
opinion
its
the
tailgating
beer
this
beer
is
a
thirst
quencher
and
easy
to
drink
it
tastes
good
especially
if
you
like
lime
drinks
however
i
dont
feel
like
im
really
drinking
beer
its
o
k
to
taste
like
lime
but
let
me
taste
some
malt
or
hops
too
otherwise
if
some
other
kind
of
beer
is
available
ill
take
it
overalll
this
was
poured
into
a
frosted
mug
for
me
and
i
was
shocked
to
see
after
i
let
the
beer
sit
for
about
three
or
four
minutes
that
small
parts
of
ice
started
floating
to
the
top
of
the
mug
what
a
travesty
might
have
been
better
if
1
it
wasnt
served
in
a
mug
2
there
wasnt
any
ice
in
it
i
dont
know
if
its
because
of
how
thin
this
beer
is
or
because
of
how
cold
the
glass
was
but
thats
what
ruined
it
for
me
overall
i
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
this
beer
even
at
a
party
or
something
i
wouldnt
go
all
beer
geek
on
them
and
talk
about
how
bad
most
adjuncts
are
but
i
try
to
always
byob
beers
like
this
is
why
o
so
it
may
not
be
terrible
but
i
still
cant
manage
to
finish
an
entire
glass
i
feel
this
is
a
beer
to
be
swigged
from
the
bottle
on
a
sultry
summer
eve
in
the
company
of
bros
unrecommended
but
if
push
comes
to
shove
or
i
need
to
blend
in
at
a
tailgate
i
would
not
disdain
this
beer
in
the
future
onothing
special
here
it
tastes
like
fizzy
lime
koolade
but
not
as
sweet
overall
not
worth
purchasing
again
i
had
heard
mixed
reviews
from
friends
and
hoped
for
the
best
unfortunately
i
cannot
give
this
beer
a
positive
review
o
not
as
horrible
as
i
imagined
but
this
has
little
to
no
real
characteristics
of
beer
with
subsequent
sips
the
lime
begins
to
taste
stale
it
lingers
hand
me
a
perrier
to
wash
away
the
shame
this
beer
has
cast
upon
selfrespecting
mineral
waters
its
crisp
clean
refreshing
dry
and
perfect
for
a
party
warm
weather
and
just
about
anything
else
the
flavor
is
better
than
i
expected
i
have
had
this
before
and
was
not
sure
how
i
felt
the
flavor
is
so
light
it
is
like
having
a
lime
flavored
alkaseltzer
practically
there
is
a
sweet
tinge
from
whatever
malt
there
is
in
this
the
lime
flavor
is
a
gentle
addition
to
the
light
beer
taste
not
overdone
and
freshens
the
slightly
dull
crisp
taste
a
bit
overall
it
is
more
of
a
drink
for
refreshing
the
palate
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
mowing
than
a
beverage
to
enjoy
the
day
after
christmas
but
for
the
price
it
isnt
terrible
overall
its
pretty
acceptable
but
not
great
by
any
means
i
will
drink
it
every
once
in
awhile
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
thought
it
would
be
better
due
to
popularity
dont
drink
this
if
you
have
acid
reflux
lol
tastes
like
wet
paper
manila
folders
soaked
in
club
soda
with
a
splash
of
lime
juice
dry
flabby
mealy
aftertaste
once
the
carbonation
dies
down
a
bit
watery
and
insipid
lacking
crispness
of
a
good
lager
with
a
touch
of
natural
lime
just
utterly
dull
and
lacking
any
sort
of
character
outside
of
the
lime
addition
water
tastes
pretty
good
with
a
lime
in
it
too
overall
drinkability
you
would
be
better
off
with
a
regular
bud
light
with
fresh
lime
and
salt
would
taste
noticably
better
mouthfeel
would
be
more
effervescent
upon
first
sip
too
poured
a
2
white
head
which
hovered
a
bit
then
fairly
quickly
collapsed
as
the
body
exhausted
all
carbonation
clear
straw
yellow
color
smell
is
grass
and
lime
taste
has
the
grass
of
typical
bud
light
but
i
was
surprised
it
actually
expressed
some
maltiness
and
the
lime
though
present
wasnt
the
artificial
limeaid
i
was
expecting
still
watery
for
a
cheap
low
cal
beer
this
is
ok
though
do
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
particularly
on
a
warm
summer
day
for
what
it
is
the
lime
addition
actually
works
rather
well
here
i
would
score
this
beer
above
bud
light
for
whatever
thats
worth
its
refreshing
in
the
right
place
this
would
be
enjoyable
on
a
cold
november
night
not
so
much
o
i
didnt
think
this
beer
was
going
to
be
good
alot
of
people
come
on
here
and
slander
abinbev
because
they
make
shitty
beer
but
this
beer
really
is
god
awful
for
me
drinking
this
beer
is
reminiscent
of
punching
myself
in
the
genitals
aggressively
im
actually
pissed
off
at
myself
and
feel
guilty
that
i
poured
this
into
my
brooklyn
brewery
tulip
shit
drainpour
eric
rjt
oim
dont
care
so
much
for
this
one
it
feels
like
not
much
thought
or
effort
went
into
brewing
the
beer
mindless
mass
production
at
its
worst
this
beer
only
works
if
its
super
cold
and
if
there
is
nothing
else
to
drink
this
is
my
fatherinlaws
favorite
beer
and
i
cant
understand
why
i
dont
usually
hate
on
beer
but
something
is
wrong
when
inbev
sells
millions
of
cases
of
this
every
year
if
you
enjoy
lovingly
hand
crafted
beer
then
stay
clear
of
this
toxic
waste
nightmare
as
far
as
light
beer
goes
you
could
definitely
do
worse
than
bll
i
am
generally
not
a
big
fan
of
fruity
beer
especially
when
its
artificial
fruitiness
but
i
still
find
this
to
be
drinkable
perhaps
even
enjoyable
with
the
proper
weather
and
situation
at
the
very
least
i
can
say
i
like
this
more
than
regular
bud
light
reasonably
inoffensive
a
serviceable
light
beer
option
the
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
and
not
overly
carbonated
for
entertainment
i
did
a
taste
test
vs
michelob
ultra
lime
cactus
and
this
bud
light
lime
the
bud
light
lime
was
better
the
mulc
was
more
watery
and
the
lime
tasted
artificial
the
only
positive
thing
that
i
can
say
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
a
nice
cold
drink
on
a
warm
day
and
if
it
is
cold
enough
you
might
get
lucky
enough
not
to
have
to
taste
it
a
good
idea
gone
horribly
bad
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
doesnt
leave
an
unpleasant
after
taste
whether
chugging
like
a
college
student
or
grippin
and
sippin
this
beer
doesnt
get
boring
stop
hating
the
light
beer
its
a
necessary
evil
did
i
mention
the
lime
basicaly
a
ruined
bud
light
for
those
that
dont
like
beer
and
like
the
taste
of
liquid
lime
bud
light
lime
is
for
younot
the
style
for
me
mouthfeel
light
sure
but
thats
not
necessarily
impressive
very
drinkable
watery
carbonation
is
decent
ill
give
it
that
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
quaffable
poolside
beer
thats
a
little
nontraditional
this
is
it
i
guess
if
i
had
to
choose
one
or
the
other
i
would
pick
this
over
miller
chill
its
only
saving
grace
is
that
it
is
a
tiny
bit
more
refreshing
than
its
competitor
playing
softball
in
the
blazing
hot
sun
on
the
first
morning
i
forgot
my
water
bottle
i
reached
into
the
cooler
and
saw
this
one
after
initially
throwing
up
in
my
mouth
thirst
and
to
be
honest
morbid
curiosity
got
the
better
of
me
cracking
open
the
can
i
took
a
big
swallow
and
nothing
tasted
pretty
much
like
regular
bud
light
nothingness
emptiness
etc
with
a
hint
of
lime
could
have
been
worse
though
i
have
no
plans
to
pick
up
any
more
drank
this
one
straight
from
the
can
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
generally
im
not
a
fan
of
bud
light
but
i
think
the
subtle
addition
of
lime
is
a
nice
addition
the
lime
is
present
in
the
smell
and
in
the
flavor
and
is
not
too
overpowering
everything
else
about
this
beer
is
average
at
best
kind
of
an
odd
flavor
it
looks
and
feels
like
any
regular
bud
light
the
taste
is
a
bit
weird
though
it
is
almost
like
you
just
mixed
a
bud
light
with
a
margarita
i
considered
mixing
it
with
a
little
regular
bud
light
to
offset
some
of
the
lime
which
was
a
little
strong
regardless
it
is
refreshing
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
landshark
might
be
a
little
more
tasty
thin
body
high
carbonation
watery
and
light
on
the
tongue
pretty
much
what
the
name
implies
although
it
definitely
doesnt
help
overall
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
unfortunately
what
it
is
is
a
crappy
adjunct
light
lager
with
lime
juice
added
to
mask
the
terrible
flavor
im
rating
it
as
a
light
lager
and
as
a
light
lager
it
falls
way
short
you
dont
really
get
any
beer
flavors
as
its
totally
overpowered
by
lime
juice
the
lime
juice
tastes
natural
but
im
not
looking
for
my
beer
to
taste
like
limes
i
always
say
if
you
need
a
lime
to
cover
up
the
taste
of
your
beer
you
should
be
drinking
a
different
beer
i
would
avoid
this
one
super
pale
yellow
produces
a
fluffy
snow
white
head
that
dissipates
immediately
smell
is
what
i
would
call
spriteradler
by
far
the
smell
is
the
best
thing
about
it
rather
fruity
citrusy
very
soda
poppy
taste
is
basically
a
dry
lime
soda
andor
alka
seltzer
with
a
slight
beer
finish
and
aftertaste
no
cloying
sweetness
left
over
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
super
thin
like
a
radler
and
refreshing
bubbly
as
easy
as
this
should
be
to
drink
something
about
it
is
vaguely
nauseating
i
cant
imagine
having
more
than
one
although
that
is
certainly
not
their
intention
it
tastes
very
artificial
not
at
all
like
a
beer
with
real
lime
in
it
poured
from
a
bottle
pours
a
clear
color
with
a
hint
of
yellow
very
thin
white
head
actually
almost
no
head
at
all
very
strong
smell
of
lime
with
a
bit
of
wheat
if
you
bury
your
nose
inside
the
glass
no
mouth
taste
really
there
just
kind
of
feels
like
water
tastes
very
strong
of
lime
pretty
much
over
powering
the
beer
really
no
taste
of
beer
until
the
after
taste
overall
i
think
its
a
plan
to
cover
up
a
shitty
beer
with
the
taste
of
lime
not
impressed

yellow
pour
a
quick
fizzy
white
head
aromas
of
lime
edging
out
the
thin
hoppiness
light
body
loads
of
lime
in
the
flavor
with
a
toned
down
grain
and
a
whisp
of
hops
this
epitomizes
the
kind
of
thing
you
might
like
to
have
on
a
hot
day
if
you
dont
want
the
flavor
of
beer
bud
light
lime
is
like
many
of
the
other
light
beers
that
have
a
hint
of
fruit
added
to
attract
the
female
populous
bud
light
lime
is
not
bad
certainly
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
the
color
is
yellow
with
good
carbonation
that
translates
to
a
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
this
beer
have
good
lime
aroma
the
taste
is
bud
light
with
lime
or
grain
and
lime
if
you
prefer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
easy
drinking
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
go
elsewhere
if
you
want
a
seriously
limeflavored
drink
limes
are
like
41
and
limeade
is
easy
to
make
taste
and
looks
like
water
no
aroma
no
head
i
hear
its
very
hard
to
make
though
and
they
get
it
the
same
every
time
i
guess
that
is
one
positive
oh
and
they
do
have
good
commercials
it
gets
a
little
bit
sweet
after
a
while
and
although
i
never
see
myself
trying
this
again
i
didnt
hate
it
for
the
price
however
you
could
get
a
case
of
beer
that
is
actually
good
so
this
is
a
failure
o
its
not
horrendous
but
i
would
rather
but
a
real
lime
in
my
own
bud
they
put
too
much
lime
in
it
so
you
can
barely
taste
any
other
flavors
the
taste
also
has
artificial
limes
light
bodied
over
carbonated
and
pretty
bad
avoid
thankfully
i
got
this
as
a
freebie
at
a
get
together
i
would
have
hated
to
pay
for
this
overall
this
is
just
another
gimmick
beer
support
microbrews
or
better
brews
by
the
bigger
companies
looks
a
very
pale
watery
golden
color
smells
very
strongly
of
lime
tastes
almost
like
a
soda
very
little
beer
flavor
detected
the
lime
is
definitely
the
dominant
flavor
up
front
finishes
with
a
wheatcereal
flavor
interesting
definitely
better
than
bud
light
because
the
skunk
flavor
is
masked
with
the
lime
but
i
can
hardly
call
this
a
beer
i
suppose
it
has
its
purpose
poolside
or
at
a
bbq
but
i
would
prefer
something
else
otherwise
all
and
all
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
a
beer
like
this
i
just
havent
found
it
yet
cheers
overall
surprisingly
inoffensive
not
very
beerlike
more
like
seltzer
with
a
twist
miles
better
than
similar
lime
flavored
malt
drinks
i
wouldnt
seek
another
out
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
overall
this
is
definitely
not
the
devils
spawn
that
the
beer
geek
community
would
have
you
believe
its
relatively
inoffensive
and
even
somewhat
refreshing
but
in
the
manner
of
sprite
which
i
think
it
has
more
in
common
with
than
beer
not
a
novel
take
but
a
valid
one
reviewing
aside
i
might
take
one
if
im
at
the
beach
and
parched
but
i
wont
pay
money
for
it
overall
this
isnt
something
that
i
would
have
purchased
but
it
was
offered
to
me
by
a
friend
and
i
figured
i
might
as
well
give
it
a
try
it
seems
to
be
selling
fairly
well
i
figured
it
would
be
a
fad
that
would
away
but
the
beer
has
been
around
for
a
few
years
now
i
still
dont
see
whats
so
hard
about
adding
your
own
lime
to
a
bud
light
or
whichever
beer
you
choose
at
least
then
it
would
taste
less
artificial
poured
this
beast
out
of
a
can
into
a
clear
plastic
cup
only
the
best
for
bud
light
it
produced
a
tiny
thin
white
head
poor
retention
no
lacing
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
aroma
was
a
hint
of
odd
smelling
lime
somehow
i
doubt
the
claim
of
100
natural
lime
flavor
there
was
a
taste
of
lime
from
start
to
finish
i
did
not
detect
any
malt
or
grain
or
hops
for
that
matter
can
someone
say
lemon
lime
vess
soda
that
has
been
sitting
out
in
an
open
2
liter
bottle
for
about
a
week
overall
bad
not
good
overall
this
beer
wasnt
nearly
as
bad
as
i
expected
it
to
be
its
like
a
fizzy
citrusy
soda
not
much
abv
so
it
doesnt
hit
hard
it
sounds
trashy
but
i
really
wouldnt
mind
a
canned
one
on
a
hot
day
fishing
or
something
overall
not
a
bad
beer
in
the
big
picture
but
isnt
really
that
great
either
the
lime
flavor
really
adds
a
lot
to
this
beer
d
meh
i
dont
know
that
i
could
down
18
of
these
in
an
evening
or
anything
but
im
glad
to
find
a
bmc
product
that
i
dont
mind
drinking
d
this
beer
certainly
surprised
me
i
am
not
a
fan
of
bud
light
but
this
seems
to
cover
up
the
off
flavors
with
a
moderately
enjoyable
lime
characteristic
if
i
was
going
to
drink
a
lot
of
beers
on
a
summer
day
i
wouldnt
mind
this
being
one
or
two
of
them
bud
light
lime
is
not
a
good
beer
compared
to
other
better
beers
but
when
used
correctly
and
without
pretension
it
is
good
pretty
average
appearance
pours
out
a
golden
straw
color
with
some
white
sudsy
head
no
lacing
of
course
plenty
of
rising
carbonation
smells
like
bud
light
with
lime
added
as
advertised
cant
really
smell
much
more
than
lime
taste
is
nothing
but
lime
the
good
thing
is
it
taste
natural
like
i
got
a
bud
light
and
literally
squeezed
lime
juice
into
it
mouth
feel
is
ok
light
bodied
highly
carbonated
like
seltzer
water
almost
dont
really
have
anything
bad
to
say
about
this
it
is
what
it
is
average
macro
lager
would
i
buy
this
on
a
regular
basis
no
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
if
thats
all
there
was
though
639
overall
the
beer
is
what
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
with
lime
in
overpowering
lime
taste
is
about
the
same
as
most
of
the
other
lime
beers
overall
easy
drinking
tonic
water
tasting
and
an
easy
floating
trip
or
marathon
beer
i
have
enjoyed
many
times
and
now
when
it
comes
down
to
it
i
can
hardly
write
anything
about
it
better
than
many
other
of
its
competitors
miller
chill
corona
lime
etc
overall
gimmick
beer
that
inspired
a
number
of
knock
offs
only
thing
that
makes
this
different
then
bud
light
is
the
lime
taste
at
least
its
easy
to
dry
no
malt
or
hop
presence
just
seems
like
someone
mixed
sprite
with
bud
light
lots
of
sprite
nothing
in
the
mouthfeel
other
than
carbonation
and
lime
soda
cannot
believe
this
is
so
popular
even
amongst
people
who
like
bud
light
o
of
the
two
big
light
lime
beers
this
is
my
preference
which
is
a
lot
like
say
that
i
would
rather
lose
a
leg
than
an
arm
is
it
artificial
or
natural
lime
flavor
can
says
100
natural
flavor
dispute
settled
average
clear
straw
color
with
average
head
retention
and
above
average
lacing
fantasticlly
quafable
i
wish
i
was
very
very
thirsy
tastes
like
lime
alcohol
selter
i
want
to
mix
it
with
some
coconut
flavored
whisky
for
a
tropical
boiler
maker
that
would
make
this
beer
that
much
more
enjoyable
overall
possible
light
beach
beer
that
did
not
capture
my
imagination
i
didnt
think
id
ever
try
this
but
a
friend
had
it
and
tossed
me
one
i
wasnt
overly
excited
to
try
it
but
i
did
anyway
the
nose
is
quite
potent
with
lime
it
smells
nice
but
its
reminding
me
of
soda
the
beer
is
clear
yellow
and
obviously
light
bodied
the
taste
is
lime
no
doubt
about
that
the
flavors
of
lime
subside
after
a
little
and
turns
into
that
very
familiar
bud
lite
flavor
most
of
us
know
and
hate
d
not
too
flavorful
since
the
only
thing
i
can
taste
is
lime
goes
down
very
easily
and
not
filling
at
all
since
theres
nothing
to
the
beer
since
its
so
light
that
makes
it
a
good
representation
of
style
it
seems
as
though
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
tries
to
appeal
to
people
that
dont
like
beer
by
tasting
as
little
like
beer
as
possible
overall
i
didnt
find
this
as
bad
as
expected
but
i
like
anything
lime
even
fake
tasting
lime
candy
that
may
explain
my
tolerance
here
sucks
but
hey
it
is
what
it
is
at
least
they
can
make
money
off
of
it
pee
yellow
the
lime
scent
was
thankfully
strong
enough
to
cover
the
goop
beer
again
the
lime
was
the
only
redeeming
quality
in
the
flavor
sweet
syrupy
stank
followed
and
a
weekold
stale
beer
flavor
finished
wanted
to
spit
the
aftertaste
out
so
i
did
thankfully
i
was
at
a
bbq
this
beer
is
barely
beer
so
its
safe
to
say
it
was
not
very
drinkable
yuck
im
banking
that
this
purchase
wont
ruin
pliny
for
me
hot
summer
days
are
the
only
place
for
these
or
if
your
out
of
every
other
beer
and
you
have
no
choice
they
also
can
cause
a
wicked
headache
avoid
finally
dragged
into
trying
one
of
these
clearly
looked
like
it
was
going
to
be
frightening
but
honestly
was
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
if
i
am
at
a
party
in
the
hot
summer
sun
and
am
asked
bud
light
bud
heavy
or
bud
light
lime
i
may
have
to
put
my
manhood
aside
and
ask
for
the
lime
imagine
drinking
a
flat
diet
seven
up
with
some
palmolive
mixed
in
and
you
have
bud
light
lime
if
you
want
to
add
a
lime
to
your
beer
why
i
dont
knwo
then
buy
a
regular
beer
and
add
a
lime
see
corona
its
not
horrible
but
maybe
if
your
sitting
at
a
mexican
restaurant
with
some
tortilla
chips
and
salsa
then
have
a
few
otherwise
no
very
thin
watery
and
light
which
is
ok
for
the
flavor
and
style
but
not
great
drinkability
is
good
as
it
should
be
since
thats
the
whole
point
of
this
beer
better
than
expected
beer
d
drinkability
was
high
because
it
was
basically
watered
down
limeade
and
went
down
like
water
d
surprisingly
this
was
not
completely
horrendous
i
dont
know
if
id
want
to
drink
a
full
glass
of
this
but
its
not
as
bad
as
some
might
lead
you
to
believe
tastewise
not
sure
that
id
take
this
even
over
bud
light
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
lime
flavor
here
i
had
this
at
my
friends
wedding
because
there
wasnt
anything
else
to
drink
lets
start
off
with
this
i
hate
any
and
all
off
the
big
3s
beers
after
saying
that
there
are
a
couple
of
good
things
i
have
to
say
about
this
beer
it
was
refreshing
after
a
night
of
dancing
this
beer
really
hit
the
spot
the
lime
flavor
was
good
it
really
took
away
from
the
piss
water
taste
of
the
bud
light
so
would
i
drink
this
again
probably
not
would
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
no
but
it
is
slightly
better
then
bud
light
which
i
consider
to
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
on
the
face
of
the
earth
beer
is
really
thin
and
too
sweet
for
what
it
is
it
has
a
terrible
aftertaste
too
kind
of
like
lime
flavored
soap
im
totally
not
into
this
this
is
far
worse
than
bud
light
imo
at
least
i
could
finish
bud
light
d
if
you
can
hold
your
nose
while
drinking
this
youll
have
no
problem
downing
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
working
yourself
to
sweat
after
quenching
your
thirst
this
beer
is
useless
d
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
i
dont
know
what
made
me
want
to
try
this
but
i
did
i
regret
it
but
hey
there
is
not
much
i
can
do
about
it
now
lime
with
spashes
of
tonic
water
would
have
the
same
effect
if
you
want
to
try
this
one
out
how
dare
ab
for
taking
away
my
american
right
to
put
a
lime
in
my
mexican
style
beer
whats
the
fun
in
drinking
this
stuff
i
need
to
put
that
lime
in
myself
i
dont
trust
anybody
to
do
it
like
i
do
it
cause
i
put
them
limes
to
good
use
i
really
know
how
to
get
the
most
out
of
that
small
wedge
and
how
dare
ab
to
take
away
market
share
from
one
of
most
popular
products
out
of
mexico
i
mean
come
on
their
ganga
sucks
what
else
do
they
have
somethings
gotta
give
d
i
really
dont
think
this
is
a
horrible
beer
with
a
mexican
or
spicy
dish
it
has
ok
drinkability
but
its
not
something
i
would
tell
anyone
to
go
out
and
buy
this
will
eventually
leave
my
fridge
especially
if
i
am
eating
spicy
or
i
have
company
over
and
save
the
crafts
for
myself
the
smell
or
the
taste
cant
decide
which
one
is
more
offensive
i
no
way
to
describe
this
beer
except
offensive
adjuct
filled
skunky
beer
meets
artificial
limemy
godjust
its
like
an
accident
on
my
palate
and
no
i
dont
think
that
real
lime
could
save
this
beer
anyway
undrinkable
at
best
clear
glass
yikes
how
come
beers
that
come
in
clear
glass
almost
always
get
some
type
of
lime
do
they
really
think
that
will
improve
it
no
lime
will
not
improve
a
poorly
made
adjuct
filled
beer
thats
been
sitting
in
clear
glass
and
no
the
canned
version
did
not
taste
any
better
when
poured
in
a
pint
glass
sorry
buds
this
one
is
better
left
alone
lifes
short
do
your
self
a
favour
and
drink
somthing
better
d
for
a
hot
day
not
bad
but
might
as
well
drink
a
watered
down
7up
not
well
balanced
artificial
tasting
and
its
only
saving
grace
is
its
refreshing
quality
this
is
not
a
good
beer
this
beer
is
made
to
be
drunk
in
large
quantities
it
might
be
good
for
chicks
or
beer
bong
i
wouldnt
be
caught
dead
with
this
beer
again
at
a
party
also
i
wouldnt
be
too
open
to
pair
this
with
any
types
of
food
except
wings
this
is
another
beer
to
mow
and
play
golf
with
i
usually
have
this
in
cans
when
i
do
have
it
putting
the
lime
in
saves
a
step
but
does
not
improve
the
taste
it
smells
and
tastes
awfull
there
is
nothing
more
good
to
say
about
it
i
would
not
drink
it
again
notes
good
bitch
beer

priced
more
than
bl
regular
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
straightforward
doesnt
really
tastes
too
much
like
beer
drinkable
if
this
is
your
thing
but
not
for
me
the
beer
pours
exactly
like
regular
bud
light
with
a
very
clear
yellow
body
and
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
heavy
on
the
lime
with
a
little
bit
of
grain
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
lime
along
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
grain
thin
body
and
medium
carbonation
not
near
as
bad
as
i
expected
i
got
an
initial
finger
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
off
of
the
pour
nose
smelled
like
an
artificial
lime

please
lets
all
remember
to
review
a
beer
with
its
style
in
mind
i
hate
buds
and
most
all
other
junk
even
remotely
close
im
embarresed
to
even
carry
any
anheuserbusch
product
in
my
fridge
however
when
rolling
out
of
a
tent
on
a
warm
saturday
morning
at
a
weekend
festival
this
beer
can
not
be
beat
ive
turned
soooo
many
beer
drinkers
onto
this
do
you
really
want
to
start
your
day
off
with

of
hydrating
yourself
with

for
the

filled
with

as

i
dont

i
could
still

a
few
if
it
was
a
hot
summer
day
and
i
wanted
something
cold
and
refreshing
that
being
said
there
are
a
lot
better
attempts
at
lime
beers
out
there
for
example
moosehead
light

actually
has

to

thats

better
than

drinkable
is
not

light
lime
isnt
anything
that
is
too
special
it
is
simply
a
very
light
beer
with
a
strong
lime
flavor
its
not
a
terrible
beer
blah
with
some
lime
taste
is
on
lighter
side
thin
taste
of
lightest
of
malts
namely
miller
chill
but
i
mean
but
probably
not
quite
as
crappy
as
i
was
expecting
still
little
bit
of
syrupy
concentrate
trouble
is
within
the
same
can
it
tasted
like
lemonade
in
some
sips
water
in
others
if
you
like
light
beer
its
ok
but
its
not
worth
paying
store
price
for
giving
it
a
4
on
drinkability
because
its
light
so
one
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
they
chose
to
d
on
a
nice
summer
float
trip
i
could
drink
this
all
day
the
light
body
and
high
carbonation
really
take
it
easy
on
the
tongue
drinkable
its
a
light
lager
i
recommend
you
try
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
refreshing
alternative
you
may
be
pleasantly
surprised
final
thoughts
well
i
knew
i
wasnt
going
to
like
bud
light
lime
but
at
least
now
i
can
sorta
understand
the
appeal
this
beer
is
a
big
time
guzzler
and
for
people
who
arent
a
fan
of
bitterness
its
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
isnt
as
bad
as
a
lot
of
people
are
making
it
out
to
be
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
ill
stick
to
a
brava
with
a
wedge
of
actual
lime
overall
this
is
an
impressive
offering
from
ab
and
heres
why
they
keep
pushing
the
absolute
boundary
of
how
bad
you
can
make
a
beer
and
use
their
incredible
marketing
power
to
make
it
outsell
the
entire
craft
brewing
industry
they
could
probably
make
natty
light
tapeworm
infested
pig
feces
and
have
it
break
1
overall
beer
market
share
whoever
the
ad
wizards
who
came
up
with
this
one
are
they
truly
are
real
men
of
genius
feels
very
light
and
a
bit
overly
carbonated
i
could
slam
about
a
million
of
these
if
i
didnt
decide
after
one
or
two
that
i
wanted
to
taste
some
hops
or
actual
beer
think
of
it
as
a
bud
light
smoothie
dugh
as
i
said
its
rather
refreshing
but
its
simply
not
beer
pretty
drinkable
though
the
lime
overpowers
and
would
at
least
for
me
become
too
much
after
probably
two
bottles
reminiscent
of
the
alcopops
that
have
begun
to
take
hold
of
the
german
market
this
stuff
is
hardly
any
more
beerlike
than
sprite
the
big
guys
need
to
realize
that
lime
isnt
added
to
corona
because
it
makes
such
a
delicious
drink
good
beer
doesnt
come
in
clear
bottles
overall
if
you
like
lime
with
your
beer
it
maybe
for
you
got
this
one
at
a
friends
house
ice
cold
opened
it
and
a
faint
smell
of
beer
hidden
behind
a
wif
of
lime
the
taste
was
faint
it
went
down
easy
nothing
i
would
drink
if
you
can
stand
the
lime
taste
go
for
it
i
would
rather
not
have
fruit
in
my
beer
but
i
guess
some
people
like
this
mfd
too
fizzy
for
me
overcarbonated
light
in
body
short
twangy
sour
note
to
finish
d
went
down
extremely
quick
in
the
summer
sun
but
my
palate
was
quickly
bored
theres
more
out
there
for
summer
quaffing
than
this
thank
god
d
i
will
not
drink
any
more
of
these
if
i
have
a
say
so
i
was
surprised
that
this
beer
tasted
pretty
clean
and
crisp
it
is
just
simple
and
all
about
lime
flavoring
would
i
buy
it
no
i
know
my
fellow
bas
like
to
bash
such
a
beer
with
low
review
scores
but
one
has
to
consider
who
this
beer
is
brewed
for
this
is
for
people
who
dont
want
beer
i
see
see
this
as
a
competitor
for
smirnoff
ice
or
mikes
hard
whatever
and
i
would
rather
have
this
than
those
sugarbombs
its
no
small
wonder
this
stuff
flies
off
the
shelves
though
for
all
i
knock
it
ive
pounded
this
stuff
back
pretty
quick
and
that
bothers
me
its
like
im
just
meant
to
pound
it
back
without
thinking
of
that
nasty
beer
taste
the
good
folks
at
anheuserbush
have
worked
so
hard
to
mask
for
me
the
problem
is
i
like
beer
and
good
beer
is
worth
savouring
im
all
for
brewers
coming
up
with
interesting
new
flavours
and
not
against
fruit
beers
but
this
stuff
wasnt
made
to
appeal
to
people
who
like
good
beer
its
more
like
malternative
than
beer
like
a
batch
that
got
churned
out
when
the
filtration
system
used
on
the
base
was
broken
down
so
they
couldnt
get
the
colour
out
of
it
its
one
saving
grace
is
that
unlike
its
brethren
coolers
it
isnt
cloyingly
sweet
from
added
sugar
even
the
bros
got
tricked
they
gave
this
product
a
c
son
of
a
gunwhats
the
world
of
beer
come
to
drinkability
overall
for
me
i
could
not
have
more
then
one
or
two
of
these
max
just
to
sweet
and
soda
like
could
imagine
having
so
many
of
these
i
got
drunk
they
are
not
gross
and
i
just
had
to
try
one
with
all
the
buzz
they
are
catching
right
now
not
terrible
but
not
for
me
doesnt
matter
what
i
think
its
becoming
a
summertime
beast
for
years
to
come
from
tasting

refreshing
but
thats
about
it
i
can
understand
the
popularity
but
not
my
thing
taste
while
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
it
is
not
a
beer
taste
there
is
nothing
that
would
even
make
this
seem
like
a
beer
besides
the
appearance
it
tastes
almost
like
a
lime
pop
but
not
like
the
lime
added
pops
it
has
its
own
unique
taste
slightly
sweet
with
a
strong
lime
flavor
yup
this
brew
is
pretty
tasty
but
not
to
sound
like
a
broken
record
this
isnt
really
beer
in
my
book
if
i
were
a
bettin
man
id
say
they
just
blended
a
high
octane
version
of
their
bud
light
with
seltzer
water
whatever
sorcery
is
at
work
behind
this
product
ill
say
that
they
hit
some
sort
of
nail
on
the
head
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
beerlime
seltzer
water
that
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
summer
and
in
summers
to
come
t
lime
it
tastes
like
lime
drink
you
cannot
taste
any
real
alcohol
its
pure
lime
way
too
overpowering
alas
once
again
one
finds
themself
at
a
bbq
where
the
only
beer
selections
are
dismal
after
2
hours
in
the
sun
you
can
no
longer
deal
with
the
torturous
drought
and
you
cave
accepting
the
horrible
swill
just
to
keep
from
perishing
this
beer
looks
terrible
it
smells
like
artificial
lime
scent
tastes
like
citrus
kitchen
cleaner
really
like
pinesol
or
some
lemonscented
dish
liquid
the
mouthfeel
is
your
standard
and
so
it
isnt
offensive
like
the
flavor
as
for
drinkability
it
is
easy
to
chug
in
fact
its
a
lot
more
sodalike
than
beer
but
drinkability
should
also
consider
the
beers
ability
to
make
you
want
to
drink
more
of
it
and
this
beer
does
not
overall
if
i
had
to
have
a
macro
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
would
not
be
it
the
only
way
this
beer
is
tolerable
is
if
its
ice
cold
and
you
have
half
a
bottle
while
the
lime
juice
wasnt
intolerable
off
the
bat
it
builds
as
you
drink
it
and
that
synthetic
flavor
just
becomes
too
much
great
as
a
lawnmower
beer
or
with
bbq
on
a
hot
day
but
it
comes
off
as
an
alcopop
not
nearly
as
good
as
other
lime
beers
ive
tried
looks
the
part
of
your
typical
american
light
lager
smells
and
tastes
the
same
which
is
to
say
not
much
but
with
an
artificial
lime
thing
dominating
a
bit
sweeter
than
regular
bl
to
balance
the
artificial
tartness
i
suppose
taste
gets
old
real
quick
but
i
guess
id
drink
this
over
a
regular
bl
as
there
is
some
kind
of
actual
flavor
in
here
fake
or
not
i
guess
i
rated
this
beer
a
little
to
good
but
in
terms
of
taste
it
really
wasnt
bad
its
just
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
resemble
beer
that
makes
most
beer
advocates
afraid
to
touch
it
if
youre
at
a
bbq
and
want
a
refreshing
drink
sift
through
that
community
cooler
and
reach
for
one
of
these
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
manly
mans
beer
look
look
somewhere
else
sad
to
say
its
horrid
compared
to
budcoors
light
and
ive
never
purchased
those
beer
d
i
could
not
drink
this
the
bad
aftertaste
ruined
any
drinkability
that
it
had
for
me
d
underwhelming
is
an
understatement
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
beeriness
but
there
just
isnt
any
here

the

corn
some

with
a

the
sinthetical

that
has

vomit
this
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tried
but
we
were
out
of
options
it
was
a
hot
day
there
was
no
choice
i
will
never
ask
the
dude
that
brought
them
again
to
bring
beer
to
any
of
my
friend
reunions
keep
away
taste
much
like
the
smell
artificial
lime
more
like
a
gross
lime
soda
than
a
beer
not
horrible
serviceable
but
not
really
a
beer
that
you
can
break
down
the
complexities
of
wow
i
actually
love
macro
garbage
with
frozen
limeade
gimme
a
bud
light
and
some
of
that
frozen
concentrate
and
i
will
have
a
great
summer
afternoon
but
this
beer
somehow
completely
fucked
up
that
formula
its
like
they
cant
even
make
shitty
beer
right
im
randomly
disappointed
by
this
one
avoid
this
product
notice
that
i
dont
even
call
this
a
beer
avoid
had
a
second
one
on
vacation
opened
and
passed
too
me
by
an
old
friend
who
loved
it
dearly
same
as
my
first
rating
above
not
very
good
in
my
books
but
my
buddy
knows
a
good
beer
when
he
tastes
one
so
im
surprised
cause
he
would
have
fought
defending
this
ones
honor
i
just
dont
get
it
i
guess
this
beer
is
sweet
not
something
i
enjoy
in
the
drinkability
factor
this
beer
should
be
drank
slowly
and
one
will
do
it
tastes
like
a
mixture
of
tequiza
bud
light
and
extra
sweetened
lime
beware
bottle
poured
a
clear
bright
golden
color
lager
with
a
fizzy
head
taste
of
lime
is
not
overly
dominant
or
too
fake
to
be
gross
not
as
bad
as
i
had
expected
just
closer
to
lemonade
then
actual
beer
somewhat
reminiscent
of
twist
shandy
that
used
to
be
brewed
by
labatt
notes
its
an
obvious
attempt
to
horn
in
on
the
corona
market
hard
to
say
which
ones
worse
the
only
reason
why
i
know
about
this
beer
is
because
of
my
early
unexperienced
drinking
days
even
then
i
hated
it
here
i
am
a
year
later
letting
out
my
anger
it
is
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
thanks
mark
for
saving
me
the
temptation
of
paying
to
try
this
pours
a
clear
notsofizzy
yellow
with
bubbly
white
foam
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
leaving
no
head
the
smell
is
a
strong
lime
zest
aroma
from
the
outset
with
some
lime
and
lemon
aromas
and
a
bit
of
malt
aroma
beneath
the
taste
is
dominated
by
lime
with
some
lemon
and
a
hint
of
sugar
the
citrus
flavors
fade
toward
the
finish
to
reveal
a
bit
of
malt
beneath
but
the
lime
lingers
after
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
citric
with
light
body
and
modest
carbonation
feel
this
is
a
refreshing
beverage
like
a
lemonade
but
the
beer
qualities
are
overwhelmed
by
the
lime
i
dont
know
if
its
beer
but
i
like
it
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
granted
my
expectations
were
low
taste
was
a
bit
of
lime
and
very
little
malt
with
almost
nothing
else
going
on
the
smell
was
like
alkaseltser
heartburn
lemon
lime
flavor
it
wasnt
an
offensive
taste
though
giving
it
enough
drink
ability
to
drink
a
few
of
this
beer
is
100
for
the
summertime
it
cools
me
down
and
goes
down
smooth
perfect
for
floating
down
the
river
with
my
freinds
its
mouthfeel
is
less
than
exciting
but
its
very
drinkable
and
does
the
job
its
supposed
to
do
refresh
and
releave
you
from
the
heat
of
the
beach
the
beer
that
has
taken
vancouver
by
storm
no
joke
all
the
beer
stores
are
telling
me
that
they
sell
out
so
quickly
that
they
have
to
put
signs
on
the
door
so
they
dont
get
asked
every
minute
whether
they
have
bud
light
lime
ironically
it
retails
for
around
1415
which
is
more
than
carib
and
a
bunch
of
limes
i
tried
some
of
my
fiances
beer
on
a
patio
where
every
drinker
but
2
had
this
beer
i
was
one
of
the
two
it
is
corona
with
artificial
lime
flavour
which
makes
corona
look
good
the
one
about
carib
the
best
of
this
beach
beer
style
is
that
with
a
real
lime
in
the
bottle
it
makes
a
refreshing
limebeer
drink
accented
by
the
taste
of
a
real
lime
when
you
take
a
crappy
version
of
the
style
and
add
artificial
lime
flavouring
then
you
get
this
overhyped
overpriced
monstrocity
dont
try
this
unless
you
want
to
look
cool
on
the
beach
thats
about
all
it
seems
good
for
i
dont
care
what
any
beer
snobs
say
this
is
the
most
refreshing
beer
ive
ever
had
this
stuff
is
made
for
the
summertime
the
look
is
typical
macro
through
the
bottle
no
need
to
pour
this
into
anything
but
your
mouth
great
lime
scent
and
taste
a
beer
made
for
the
golf
course
which
is
why
im
very
grateful
it
now
comes
in
cans
i
love
my
iipas
and
wheats
but
when
i
want
to
beat
the
heat
and
get
sauced
doing
it
this
is
the
ticket
d
goes
down
easy
decent
price
easy
to
come
by
so
in
my
opinion
good
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
drinklike
a
cool
glass
of
water
nothing
beerlike
stands
out
and
i
dont
think
id
reach
for
it
if
i
wanted
a
beer
flavor
is
not
all
that
awful
possibly
an
improvement
on
normal
bud
light
but
after
a
while
it
basically
tastes
like
a
lime
seltzer
including
the
nonexistent
mouthfeel
so
watery
so
little
real
flavor
but
not
as
artificial
as
i
was
expecting
refreshing
yes
if
cold
enough
worth
it
by
ba
standards
no
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
does
its
job
on
hot
summer
days
ill
be
honest
i
reviewed
partly
on
my
own
taste
and
not
entirely
to
style
to
style
this
is
dead
on
but
i
dont
care
for
it
i
mixed
the
scores
a
bit
pardon
me
d
blah
my
tap
water
is
a
better
way
to
quench
my
thirst
and
there
are
much
better
and
more
efficient
ways
to
get
alcohol
in
your
blood
even
though
im
not
too
impressed
by
this
beer
i
still
think
its
better
than
regular
bud
light
it
looks
like
beer
to
my
surprise
pale
pale
yellow
white
head
that
disappears
quick
with
no
lacing
it
smells
sweet
like
sprite
or
sierra
mist
or
something
tastes
like
fruit
loops
specifically
green
fruit
loops
behind
the
dominate
fruity
assault
theres
a
faint
dry
grainy
taste
in
the
background
if
you
use
your
imagination
this
kinda
tastes
like
cheap
key
lime
pie
the
bottle
says
natural
lime
flavor
but
i
say
bullshit
everyone
has
squeezed
a
lime
into
a
corona
natural
lime
flavor
doesnt
taste
like
green
fruit
loops
that
being
said
the
beer
does
go
down
easy
the
only
thing
that
would
stop
me
from
having
several
of
these
if
they
were
free
would
be
the
shame
of
being
seen
with
one
in
my
hand
d
while
its
one
terrible
excuse
for
a
beer
this
could
pass
for
a
smrinoff
ice
or
something
it
works
for
what
its
going
for
and
thats
summer
drinkability
for
the
masses
ok
summer
beer
i
hope
to
never
have
again
i
may
not
even
bother
finishing
it
the
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
it
isnt
really
beer
it
is
a
malt
beverage
that
is
made
for
young
adults
and
women
who
dont
like
beer
but
want
to
be
trendy
my
girlfriend
loves
it
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
but
this
is
not
beer
and
it
is
a
complete
disgrace
to
the
traditional
lager
and
lime
my
advice
to
bud
is
to
take
this
beer
remove
the
alcohol
and
market
it
to
teens
they
can
have
it
over
ice
and
still
feel
cool
thanks
anheuserbusch
but
i
think
i
can
add
lime
to
my
own
beer
in
the
future
after
all
if
i
wanted
a
margarita
id
have
ordered
one
this
is
pretty
much
a
very
weak
fizzy
margarita
bubbles
dextrose
lime
watered
down
alcohol
id
call
this
a
chick
drink
but
im
afraid
the
women
i
know
would
beat
me
senseless
for
saying
so
my
drinking
buddy
left
the
majority
of
the
bottle
on
the
bar
case
closed
the
bartender
said
were
getting
miller
chill
soon
in
our
province
like
thats
any
consolation
overall
a
decent
flavorless
fake
tasting
offering
from
ab
avoid
if
possible
not
the
worst
option
for
a
party
overall
a
good
beer
for
an
outdoor
barbecue
it
does
have
drinkablility
in
the
sense
that
it
has
sodalike
sweetness
and
a
watered
down
taste
goes
down
easy
but
there
is
no
substance
to
it
im
also
drinking
this
one
quickly
because
i
dont
want
to
know
how
it
tastes
when
it
warms
up
a
little
it
should
be
noted
however
that
it
does
taste
and
drink
just
like
a
soda
pop
it
has
the
unmistakable
texture
of
artificial
carbonation
an
unnaturally
sweet
flavour
one
that
is
likely
to
appeal
to
children
no
less
and
is
somewhat
refreshing
that
last
point
is
really
contingent
on
weather
and
ones
level
of
thirst
bottom
line
anything
that
tastes
less
like
bud
light
is
better
than
bud
light
in
my
books
dno
thanks
its
all
lime
and
no
beer
this
is
more
like
some
kind
of
flavored
malt
liquor
than
an
actual
fruit
beer
i
cant
even
say
that
the
style
is
identifiable
light
golden
color
typical
of
this
style
heavily
carbonated
with
a
white
bubbly
carbonation
that
is
constantly
reenergized
as
you
drink
pretty
much
just
a
sweet
citrus
smell
theres
really
not
much
bear
to
taste
here
mostly
just
the
unusually
sweet
lime
the
brew
in
and
of
itself
is
not
overly
sweet
just
the
lime
component
it
also
has
a
bit
of
a
salty
palette
i
dont
know
if
this
is
done
meaningfully
specifically
for
this
brew
as
i
find
the
palette
of
most
budweiser
products
to
have
a
similar
salty
feel
either
way
its
there
if
you
dont
really
like
bud
light
this
will
be
a
plus
for
you
because
the
bud
light
taste
is
drowned
out
light
bodied
overly
carbonated
as
you
progress
through
this
brew
the
flavor
seems
to
weaken
and
thin
out
by
the
time
you
reach
the
end
its
mostly
flavorless
i
guess
the
drinkability
is
fine
if
youve
been
mowing
the
lawn
or
painting
the
house
and
just
want
some
adult
refreshment
thats
a
bit
different
drinkability
is
good
if
you
dont
care
about
taste
or
anything
this
is
definitely
a
beer
one
could
drink
all
day
long
on
a
hot
day
bud
light
lime
would
not
be
an
awful
selection
but
very
close
to
an
awful
selection
i
wouldnt
turn
these
down
at
a
barbeque
if
they
were
the
only
beers
being
served
but
i
would
probably
emasculate
the
crap
out
of
anyone
serving
it
it
does
look
a
tad
refreshing
in
the
commercials
but
when
i
saw
it
in
person
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
the
taste
was
like
grahm
crackers
with
lime
in
it
it
did
not
taste
a
thing
like
beer
to
me
it
was
a
little
on
the
weak
side
i
am
not
going
to
say
dont
try
it
because
i
know
tons
who
like
it
but
its
not
my
kind
of
brew
and
i
am
not
a
bud
person
this
beer
is
not
good
i
couldnt
finish
the
entire
bottle
i
expected
someting
along
the
lines
of
putting
a
lime
in
a
corona
or
dos
equis
but
this
is
a
totally
different
and
worse
experience
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
clear
glass
long
neck
bottle
served
in
a
standard
tap
glass
color
is
an
uninspiring
clear
strawyellow
and
the
white
head
is
thin
and
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
strongly
of
lime
the
best
aspect
of
this
particular
beer
flavor
is
thin
and
despite
a
good
hint
of
lime
fails
to
inspire
texture
is
a
little
tingly
but
not
enough
to
make
up
for
its
wateriness
drinkability
i
got
this
on
a
cruise
and
my
though
was
not
again
i
like
fruit
beers
to
taste
like
fruit
and
beer
this
tastes
like
something
i
would
get
from
dairy
queen
not
a
beer
if
i
want
dairy
queen
i
will
go
there
instead
it
is
going
to
be
quite
amusing
to
review
this
and
cable
car
on
back
to
back
days
d
ok
while
not
a
beer
and
not
a
wine
cooler
this
is
a
beverage
that
may
do
well
at
a
concert
or
on
a
boat
or
at
the
beach
accompanied
by
some
jimmy
buffet
music
other
than
that
ill
pass
i
deserve
better
you
deserve
better
humanity
deserves
better
very
little
beer
taste
absolutely
no
bitterness
more
lime
than
beer
i
cant
say
much
else
about
this
drink
good
but
shouldnt
even
be
on
this
site
with
beer
ive
seen
soft
drinks
hold
a
better
head
looks
and
smells
a
lot
like
a
corona
but
friends
dont
be
fooled
if
you
think
corona
is
garbage
youd
be
right
and
this
is
worse
than
that
very
light
almost
not
there
kind
of
like
drinking
water
but
somehow
its
lighter
than
water
i
wouldnt
pour
this
beer
in
my
backyard
if
that
gives
you
any
indication
of
drinkability
d
this
isnt
drinkable
this
is
poundable
now
i
can
see
why
people
buy
this
shit
pound
it
and
move
on
to
the
next
there
isnt
really
anything
to
enjoy
here
just
some
lime
flavor
on
top
of
cornflakes
im
not
impressed
by
it
but
given
the
right
situation
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
is
it
better
than
keystone
you
bet
better
than
coors
light
marginally
better
than
regular
bud
light
marginally
around
my
buddies
still
in
college
and
their
fridges
id
reach
for
this
the
appearance
of
this
is
only
one
step
darker
than
water
the
smell
is
downright
offensive
it
literally
smells
like
a
lime
flavored
candy
there
isnt
a
hint
of
beer
taste
to
be
found
in
this
concoction
only
some
limeflavored
idontknowwhat
the
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
its
like
other
ab
products
or
water
i
will
never
drink
another
one
of
these
there
is
absolutely
no
redeeming
qualities
for
this
useless
swill
ok
is
this
beer
all
i
could
taste
was
lime
there
was
no
hint
of
lime
it
was
all
lime
in
every
drink
other
than
that
it
looks
like
bud
light
is
thin
and
watery
like
bud
light
but
where
at
least
you
could
chug
bud
light
this
crap
is
like
chugging
a
limeaid
with
extra
fizz
i
cant
accurately
review
this
since
i
cant
give
0
scores
in
any
category
worst
beer
ive
ever
drank
d
not
the
worst
beer
out
there
but
i
would
never
again
purchase
it
i
did
it
i
tried
it
as
a
home
brewer
and
beer
geek
i
did
it
at
first
look
its
a
light
yellow
not
much
head
not
impressed
taste
was
like
dish
soap
and
limey
smell
was
limey
aonly
good
if
you
are
fishing
and
u
like
coranas
and
dont
want
to
cut
up
a
lime
with
fishy
hands
this
is
not
a
beer
i
am
convinced
it
one
of
those
clearly
canadian
flavored
waters
with
some
yellow
food
coloring
there
is
no
malt
or
hop
flavors
at
all
to
its
credit
it
is
not
the
foulest
thing
ab
has
put
out
on
the
market
god
only
knows
why
my
sister
in
law
loves
this
stuff
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
seconds
to
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
jolly
rancher
not
lime
but
lemon
how
odd
there
are
absolutely
no
beer
qualities
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
surprisingly
pleasant
like
the
aroma
it
is
more
candy
or
wine
cooler
like
than
beer
like
in
fact
if
i
were
blind
folded
i
would
probably
guess
that
this
was
a
soda
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
but
not
annoyingly
high
the
was
most
macro
beers
are
overall
this
is
something
i
will
not
be
drinking
again
i
like
beer
too
much
to
waste
my
time
drinking
things
that
arent
beery
appearance
is
straw
colored
crisp
dissapating
head
with
no
lace
smell
of
mainly
lime
and
other
adjuncts
taste
has
a
refreshing
lime
flavor
that
goes
down
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
with
a
light
mouthfeel
i
can
see
this
being
a
quencher
on
a
hot
day
without
being
to
filling
at
a
bbq
avoid
at
all
costs
if
you
want
lime
with
your
beer
just
stick
a
wedge
of
lime
in
it
and
drink
it
no
need
to
go
this
far
and
make
a
glorified
lime
seltzerflavored
beer
d
no
dont
do
it
unless
its
free
d
3
0
its
different
which
i
can
appreciate
but
its
not
in
my
top
10
or
anything
its
strange
for
sure
i
like
it
better
than
miller
chill
its
okay
if
you
are
after
this
type
of
thing
d
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
finishing
just
one
out
of
all
the
ab
products
this
would
probably
be
my
second
favorite
behind
american
ale
but
that
still
isnt
saying
much
this
beer
isnt
really
useful
except
something
cheap
and
refreshing
to
drink
on
the
beach
or
by
the
pool
in
summer
i
dont
understand
how
several
reviews
mention
that
this
beer
is
tasty
and
refreshing
often
with
mexican
food
yet
still
rate
this
as
a
d
or
lower
that
said
i
bet
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
cook
with
for
a
lot
of
stuff
it
might
be
worth
keeping
a
6pack
in
your
fridge
when
you
need
beery
acidic
accents

and
husbands
when
they
want
to
venture
to
where
the
construction
worker
goes
and
leave
their

coolers
behind

pick
this
up

has

d
having
an
ice
cold
bll
after
a
hard
day
of
work
is
actually
quite
refreshing
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
taste
wise
but
it
borders
on
being
a
wine
cooler
d
this
beer
wasnt
horrible
however
im
glad
that
it
was
free
and
its
just
not
for
me
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
displeasing
taste
and
could
definitely
down
a
bunch
of
these
in
one
sitting
not
that
i
would
want
to
ever
yellow
golden
color
typical
short
lived
large

aroma
is

filled
no

some
sort

not
very
good
very
much
a

beer
here
light
and
refreshing
and
not
meant
to
be
any
masterpiece
pretty
much
an
american
version
of
shandyradler
you
shouldnt
either
pours
a
pale
clear
yellow
15
inch
head
with
no
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
of
a
strong
lime
aroma
reminiscent
of
a
lime
soda
fits
the
style
more
of
a
fruitvegetable
beer
than
an
american
adjunct
lager
at
least
on
taste
smooth
average
crispness
high
carbonation
tastes
of
lime
flavoring
up
front
with
a
thin
lager
background
besides
the
overpowering
lime
flavor
the
lager
is
almost
like
water
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
beer
so
much
as
a
lime
soda
overall
not
very
good
at
all
unless
youre
extremely
hot
and
need
something
to
cool
you
off
great
beer
for
none
beer
drinkers
and
those
who
just
want
something
different
from
all
those
heavy
micros
just
a
side
note
though
i
had
another
bottle
last
night
with
tacos
it
went
pretty
well
with
that
ive
used
the
lost
at
sea
scenario
for
other
light
beers
so
i
might
as
well
use
it
again
if
i
was
lost
at
sea
with
sharks
all
around
and
the
sun
beating
down
i
could
certainly
go
for
a
few
of
these
and
as
an
added
bonus
theyd
help
me
fight
scurvy
im
only
kidding
of
course
well
not
really
i
do
like
it
but
i
kind
of
cant
respect
it
as
a
beer
ive
enjoyed
a
few
at
parties
and
they
go
down
really
easy
its
just
that
overall
i
find
it
kind
of
lacking
the
lime
flavor
dominates
so
why
use
beer
as
the
base
vodka
and
lime
works
for
me
just
as
well
of
course
this
is
easy
hmmm
let
me
just
go
with
it
is
refreshing
and
it
tastes
good
and
its
drinkable
if
you
mixed
a
fizzy
lime
soda
with
a
bud
light
this
is
what
you
would
get
there
is
nothing
impressive
about
this
beer
can
you
call
it
that
at
first
the
lime
scent
isnt
that
bad
its
almost
refreshing
after
a
while
it
kind
of
became
overpowering
and
i
dreaded
having
to
take
a
whiff
the
taste
is
fizzy
lime
drink
with
no
hops
or
malts
detectable
nevertheless
its
fairly
drinkable
so
its
not
a
complete
loss

d
very
drinkable
for
this
style
the
lime
flavor
sets
it
apart
from
others
the
feel
is
good
its
trying
to
hard
to
be
like
a
corona
but
does
still
retain
that
bud
taste
and
feel
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
abs
beers
but
i
think
this
may
be
one
of
the
better
beers
bud
has
put
out
would
be
good
at
least
as
a
summer
cookout
beer
this
was
worth
the
morbid
interest
try
but
i
wont
be
spending
any
money
on
it
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
its
the
only
option
at
a
summer
bbq
but
itll
get
edged
out
pretty
easily
from
the
cheap
domestics
too
at
first
i
couldnt
decide
whether
this
tasted
more
like
a
lemonlime
sweet
tart
or
smartie
but
there
really
isnt
enough
tang
for
this
to
be
a
sweet
tart
there
was
a
hint
of
very
plain
light
barley
malt
in
the
background
but
this
beer
was
mostly
a
lime
candyflavored
beverage
barely
beer
but
technically
it
is
i
will
also
give
it
credit
for
being
completely
inoffensive
to
the
palate
if
youre
offended
by
fruity
booze
trying
to
pass
as
beer
however
thats
another
story
one
was
enough
for
me
o
candy
sweet
little
taste
come
on
people
just
squeeze
a
lime
in
a
corona
on
the
whole
i
really
dont
want
to
finish
this
beer
nor
drink
any
more
of
them
wouldnt
spend
money
on
it
but
i
wonder
how
miller
chill
stacks
up
ha
a
conversation
from
earlier
tonight
reminded
me
to
review
this
beer
and
like
i
said
i
would
prefer
a
corona
with
a
real
lime
served
in
a
salt
lined
glass
it
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
weak
head
nose
and
taste
are
of
grains
rice
and
artificial
ingredients
thin
body
feels
like
sprite
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
thin
body
it
is
well
carbonated
this
is
oddly
like
drinking
lemonlime
soda
no
where
near
the
chore
i
thought
it
would
be
to
drink
main
negative
point
its
still
bud
light
wouldnt
ever
buy
glad
the
only
one
i
ever
had
was
given
to
me
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
who
would
want
to
this
is
an
attempt
to
floor
the
market
of
lime
beers
to
the
max
one
thing
i
can
say
is
its
better
then
miller
chill
but
not
better
then
a
corona
my
final
verdict
stick
to
corona
if
you
want
this
style
otherwise
avoid
i
usually
dont
directly
dis
beer
but
this
one
was
pretty
bad
ive
had
one
at
a
club
and
it
wasnt
horrible
then
i
guess
you
just
have
to
be
in
the
mood
drinkability
yea
its
got
this
why
wouldnt
it
light
crisp
refreshing
for
a
hot
day
and
a
flavor
that
appeals
to
people
who
dont
like
beer
i
like
beer
so
this
one
is
one
id
pass
on
but
it
does
do
the
job
it
was
made
to
do
d
all
the
components
together
made
me
not
want
to
finish
this
beer
i
think
i
did
though
pale
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
kamikaze
drink
taste
is
bud
light
with
a
nice
splash
of
citrusy
lime
this
is
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
miller
chill
i
like
this
beer
and
will
buy
it
on
a
regular
basis
good
job
by
ab
i
drank
this
its
true
it
tastes
like
someone
poured
together
half
a
glass
of
piss
beer
and
half
a
glass
of
lime
juice
into
a
bottle
stirred
and
served
which
lets
be
honest
is
pretty
close
to
what
they
probably
did
only
it
was
lime
flavoring
not
lime
juice
honestly
its
not
terrible
but
its
not
really
beer
to
me
basically
its
a
fruit
beer
with
that
fruit
being
a
lime
thing
high
carbonation
strong
lime
flavoring
and
thats
it
not
worth
your
time
if
youre
interested
in
drinking
beer
but
if
you
like
weird
lime
things
this
is
for
you
dude
i
always
understood
that
their
was
a
manlaw
against
fruiting
the
beer
as
a
coffee
enthusiast
i
know
that
many
coffee
companies
will
flavor
their
inferior
coffee
crops
to
cover
up
the
substandard
product
i
can
only
imagine
that
the
same
concept
would
apply
in
the
world
of
coffee
nothing
special
about
this
beer
just
an
attempt
at
an
exotic
taste
not
to
bash
a
beer
but
a
macrobrew
trying
to
be
exotic
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
contradiction
to
me
well
to
start
off
with
bud
light
lime
i
have
to
admit
that
its
one
of
the
lightest
tasting
beers
ive
had
im
a
pretty
big
fan
of
dropping
a
lime
in
a
beer
when
i
can
so
naturally
i
had
to
try
this
one
yeah
the
lime
flavoring
is
noticeable
but
definetly
not
overpowering
i
agree
with
the
poster
who
said
if
you
dont
like
beer
this
is
the
drink
that
will
get
you
drunk
or
something
like
that
ill
also
admit
that
this
definetly
wouldnt
be
a
beer
afficianados
idea
of
a
great
brew
but
on
a
beach
day
or
a
game
day
or
just
anytime
you
want
to
have
a
cold
one
or
two
with
no
real
goal
in
mind
i
have
no
problem
reaching
for
this
one
its
very
drinkable
which
is
its
strongest
point
i
believe
while
it
may
not
be
the
favorite
beer
of
most
people
i
bet
id
be
hardpressed
to
find
many
who
downright
hate
it
i
think
ab
hit
the
spot
pretty
well
with
this
one
d
if
you
dont
like
beer
this
is
what
you
drink
to
get
drunk
i
personally
cant
stand
the
lime
flavoring
and
the
small
amount
of
alcohol
means
itll
take
most
a
looot
of
lime
flavor
12
to
get
through
the
night
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
was
all
lime
not
a
hint
of
anything
beer
taste
was
very
corona
like
definetly
lime
without
a
hint
of
cereal
grains
or
malt
a
citric
acid
aftertaste
like
a
phosphate
soda
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
and
carbonated
for
a
hot
day
i
would
still
prefer
a
regular
light
macro
but
this
wasnt
to
bad
out
of
the
trendy
lime
beers
i
have
tried
this
is
the
better
of
them

given
the
choice
id
rather
get
a
corona
or
dos
equis
at
least
you
can
add
a
real
lime
im
not
a
fan
of
macros
overall
this
is
an
average
attempt
at
this
genre
this
would
work
on
a
hot
day
if
served
very
cold
and
maybe
straight
from
the
bottle
this
beer
is
a
great
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
would
pick
this
over
a
coronalandsharkmiller
chill
insert
gimmicky
flavored
beer
here
any
day
of
the
week
not
an
overpowering
lime
taste
but
still
much
better
than
a
bud
light
good
work
ab
not
a
great
product
at
all
then
again
its
coming
out
of
anheuser
busch
and
not
too
much
out
of
there
is
that
great
essentially
it
tastes
like
a
watered
down
corona
with
lime
juice
squeezed
in
it
not
recommended
at
all
id
almost
rather
grab
a
busch
light
then
drink
this
again
i
havent
had
the
miller
chill
in
awhile
but
from
what
i
recall
this
is
better
but
only
by
a
small
margin
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
really
taste
much
like
a
beer
drinks
surprisingly
well
enough
for
one
could
almost
see
a
somewhat
refreshing
quality
to
it
on
a
hot
day
for
nonbeer
drinkers
if
i
liked
lime
soda
more
i
may
have
liked
this
one
more
its
okay
for
what
it
is
i
suppose
but
one
is
enough
overall
this
isnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
had
miller
chill
about
a
year
ago
and
i
believe
this
to
be
better
however
that
does
not
mean
that
i
will
be
purchasing
either
again
12
oz
bottle
pours
yellow
with
a
white
tiny
fizzy
head
which
diminished
immediately
had
a
light
doughy
smell
with
the
obvious
limeflavored
aroma
taste
was
actually
not
bad
like
a
good
corona
with
a
lime
had
a
somewhat
salty
finish
it
was
pretty
fizzy
on
the
palate
too
much
carbonation
not
great
but
drinkable
same
coworkers
house
as
my
mich
ultra
review
i
was
pressured
into
trying
bl
with
lime
i
had
read
possibly
in
ba
mag
how
many
millions
of
barrels
of
miller
chill
had
been
sold
which
led
to
ab
wanting
a
piece
of
the
action
who
is
drinking
this
stuff
i
dont
mind
the
occasional
fruity
beer
but
i
am
rarely
if
ever
chopping
up
fresh
fruit
to
garnish
my
beer
with
never
mind
fresh
fruit
what
about
an
imitation
lime
flavoring
it
tastes
like
limeade
with
a
twist
of
beer
way
too
sweet
to
be
anything
close
to
enjoyable
i
think
the
taste
that
i
took
didnt
even
clear
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
i
returned
it
to
my
friend
to
finish
it
up
i
cant
believe
that
people
willingly
choose
this
stuff
to
drink
im
holding
out
for
bud
light
weed
ill
post
the
same
review
for
miller
chill
which
i
thought
was
equally
bad
this
might
be
ok
at
a
summer
picnic
but
it
has
to
be
ice
cold
better
than
corona
with
lime
imho
not
recommended
even
for
nonbeer
drinkers
if
im
in
the
mood
for
easy
drinking
lime
taste
in
the
future
theres
a
strong
chance
ill
be
going
for
some
kind
of
tequila
drink
instead
of
one
of
these
concoctions
typical
bud
pale
gold
color
atypical
aroma
however
like
a
drivein
limeade
little
head
that
quickly
fades
and
no
lacing
at
all
surprisingly
natural
lime
flavors
not
like
the
candyartificial
i
was
expecting
mediumlight
body
higher
carbonation
this
is
akin
to
a
girly
drink
think
smirnoff
ice
it
will
probably
be
a
hit
with
underfed
tanorexic
girls
in
lamiami
this
is
bud
light
with
artificial
lime
flavor
the
color
was
like
youd
expect
smelled
like
artificial
limes
taste
was
bud
light
with
artificial
lime
flavor
thin
mouthfeel
the
only
thing
going
for
it
is
the
quaffability
goes
down
like
water
tried
one
to
say
i
tried
it
and
thats
it
d
it
is
what
it
is
i
am
making
a
sacrifice
in
the
name
of
advocating
i
do
not
advocate
this
unless
you
cannot
make
your
mind
up
between
having
a
beer
or
a
sprite
tried
the
bud
light
lime
for
the
very
first
time
the
color
of
the
beer
is
the
same
as
most
standard
budweiser
products
but
you
can
taste
a
little
hint
of
lime
in
the
beer
the
lime
taste
is
very
subitle
but
is
also
felt
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
were
free
overall
very
disappointing
oh
wait
its
another
macro
lager
so
i
shouldnt
be
very
bland
and
watery
not
worth
the
money
id
probably
chug
it
if
it
was
free
id
rather
have
a
labatt
blue
light
d
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
but
mostly
due
to
the
mouthfeel
an
easy
beer
that
does
not
take
much
to
drink
the
slight
saltiness
with
a
refreshing
mintlime
taste
made
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
decent
overall
but
nothing
major
and
i
cant
say
i
would
make
this
one
a
beer
of
choice
in
the
future
i
guess
i
can
agree
that
its
light
enough
to
go
down
easy
on
a
warm
summer
day
not
drinkable
this
is
basically
alcoholic
seltzer
water
with
lime
hmm
must
have
liked
another
beer
companies
idea
another
lime
kindabeer
i
give
this
about
the
same
rating
as
miller
chill
but
each
have
a
little
individuality
bll
has
less
carbonation
and
is
a
little
more
drinkable
personally
i
dont
think
it
has
as
much
flavor
as
mc
give
it
a
try
however
not
a
terrible
summer
treat
on
rare
occasion
give
it
a
shot
the
taste
is
candy
too
very
sweet
refreshing
in
the
way
that
pop
is
actually
it
might
be
better
than
pop
but
it
seems
fake
again
its
the
processed
candy
flavor
that
i
am
fighting
with
lacks
the
acidic
twang
of
real
fruit
by
leaps
and
bounds
i
prefered
the
miller
chill
there
was
a
better
balance
of
added
flavors
the
base
beer
itself
is
better
and
best
of
its
not
flat
like
bud
light
lime
drinkability
is
pretty
good
and
refreshing
my
sister
likes
this
stuff
and
i
have
read
lots
of
varying
opinions
on
it
so
i
stole
a
single
from
the
six
pack
i
bought
her
pours
a
clear
straw
color
and
a
tight
white
head
that
eventually
becomes
a
ring
of
lace
around
the
glass
aroma
is
similar
to
how
a
corona
smells
after
putting
a
lime
in
the
lime
smell
does
have
a
certain
generic
quality
about
it
besides
that
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
smell
department
taste
is
dominated
by
the
lime
but
also
has
some
salt
and
cereal
grains
feel
is
light
and
could
use
some
more
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
half
bad
i
would
take
this
over
a
regular
bud
light
most
likely
anheiser
busch
has
created
an
average
beer
that
has
some
clever
marketing
behind
it
lime
flavored
nachos
with
salsa
on
the
side
sounds
like
a
good
pairing
cheers
poured

smells
of
beer
with
lime
similar
to
corona
but
no
skunkiness
for
what
it
is
i
kinda
like
it
tatses
like
a
pale
beer
with
lime
of
course
and
has
subtle
hints
of
sweet
and
saltiness
to
it
not
bad
no
mouthfeelbut
seriously
did
you
expect
onea
beer
i
would
choose
over
other
macros
md
feels
like
a
bud
light
crisp
light
and
watery
it
drinks
like
a
poorly
made
margarita
i
highly
recommend
not
wasting
your
time
on
it
unless
you
love
the
taste
of
lime
d
this
isnt
great
and
probably
not
even
good
but
sadly
id
probably
grab
it
before
any
other
mexicanesque
beer
edit
i
am
happy
to
say
that
after
12
hour
i
did
get
the
standard
bl
headache
that
i
always
get
after
one
bl
so
in
case
anyone
was
wondering
if
there
really
is
a
beer
in
there
somewhere
there
is
and
its
a
bud
light
i
lowered
my
drinkability
score
based
on
this
latest
finding
i
cant
drink
this
stuff
it
just
seems
stupid
to
me
it
does
not
taste
like
beer
at
all
but
just
some
lime
drink
with
bitters
something
you
would
drink
when
not
in
the
mood
for
beer
pale
yellow
colorquite
the
large
head
at
first
though
it
is
gone
rather
quickly
moderate
aromaquite
the
lime
presence
clean
flavor
though
relies
heavily
on
the
lime
taste
almost
too
much
i
have
to
balance
this
against
miller
chill
which
i
just
had
thats
a
lot
more
subtle
decent
bodyactually
quite
full
for
the
style
rather
drab
overall
too
much
lime
for
me
not
lime
kool
aid
like
but
still
overdone
like
the
other
flavored
beers
out
there
i
would
say
this
is
ok
for
what
it
is
trying
to
be
bud
light
lime
is
a
shameless
attempt
to
cash
in
on
the
recent
and
regrettable
trend
of
limeflavored
beer
sticking
a
slice
of
lime
in
the
neck
of
a
corona
was
a
pain
in
the
ass
anyway
the
one
time
i
actually
did
it
for
my
money
any
added
ingredient
that
can
effectively
cover
up
the
socalled
flavor
of
bud
light
is
an
improvement
okay
so
bud
light
liver
and
onions
might
not
be
so
good
i
tried
one
of
these
after
helping
my
buddy
put
his
dock
in
the
beer
pours
out
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
white
fizzy
head
the
head
didnt
stick
around
for
long
though
no
lacing
at
all
smell
was
pretty
basic
kind
of
grainy
but
the
lime
definitely
makes
an
appearance
taste
was
about
the
same
nothing
special
leaves
a
nasty
aftertaste
overall
though
the
beer
was
pretty
smooth
and
a
little
fizzy
it
felt
good
on
this
hot
summer
day
but
the
taste
and
smell
just
didnt
help
it
out
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
another
one
of
these
unless
its
all
thats
available
great
concept
but
this
is
going
in
the
wrong
direction
for
beer
and
you
cant
even
compare
this
to
a
good
lager
and
lime

could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
and
then
the
heart
burn
might
set
in
imo
not
my
cup
of
tea
it
just
really
isnt
that
bad
at
all
make
no
mistake
the
bashings
will
happen
i
just
threw
up
in
my
mouth
thinking
of
this
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
with
your
mouth
one
of
these
lightest
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
give
me
alcoholic
bitter
water
over
this
pours
a
surprising
dark
copper
color
but
no
head
whatsoever
smells
like
pretty
much
all
other
adjunct
lagers
goes
down
real
smooth
only
because
there
is
no
flavor
or
hops
a
tad
dry
though
if
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
beer
with
no
taste
this
is
the
beer
for
you
looks
great
but
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
very
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
it
pretty
much
tastes
like
water
but
i
suppose
that
is
what
you
get
with
a
55
calorie
beer
it
is
a
good
bargain
for
people
that
like
the
taste
of
beer
just
not
a
serious
beer
not
more
than
a
beer
to
drink
when
you
on
a
diet
overall

55
calories
as
a
beer
it
is
not
a
shining
example
for
a
quick
refresher
or
something
light
with
lunch
it
goes
well
its
guaranteed
to
not
offend
and
it
drinks
easy
it
has
its
place
although
its
not
as
good
as

this
beer
pours
the
color
of
watered
down
urine
side
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
nasty
soapy
head
that
goes
from
huge
to
nonexistent
very
quickly
smells
like
metal
shavings
tastes
like
it
looks
i
wish
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
almost
nonexistent
overall
a
terrible
attempt
at
making
beer
drinking
a
healthy
past
time
just
like
turkey
bacon
sucks
so
does
this
beer
will
never
ever
ever
seek
out
was
only
tasted
because
it
was
a
freebie
this
tastes
like
some
sort
of
slightly
alcoholic
grainy
water
it
is
the
most
tasteless
beer
i
have
ever
encountered
if
you
want
to
avoid
carbs
and
calories
and
also
like
lower
alcohol
levels
and
also
do
not
care
at
all
about
taste
than
this
is
your
beer
if
you
care
about
taste
this
is
simply
not
on
the
table
this
doesnt
offend
me
with
bad
flavors
but
it
offends
me
because
there
is
nothing
here
in
flavor
or
body
i
suppose
that
might
be
a
result
of
stripping
almost
all
calories
out
of
the
brew
but
it
is
not
good
in
any
way
just
a
strangely
unique
yet
terrible
mouthfeel
as
well
it
feels
as
if
the
beer
was
never
on
the
palate
after
a
sip
nope
was
given
to
me
for
free
and
i
drank
it
after
work
would
have
gotten
the
same
experience
out
of
tap
water
no
color
rice
smell
and
very
little
to
come
by
in
the
way
of
taste
it
didnt
make
me
wretch
like
some
people
on
this
site
would
say
but
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
nor
would
i
recommend
i
doubt
it
would
ever
be
in
my
fridge
owhat
i
expected
is
what
i
got
this
beer
is
great
for
many
that
want
to
have
a
beer
and
be
able
to
drink
beer
all
night
it
would
be
great
at
a
party
and
to
drink
on
a
summer
day
while
i
was
grilling
o
this
is
a
perfectly
marketed
beer
it
is
low
in
calories
and
alcohol
content
it
wont
offend
anyones
taste
buds
because
there
isnt
any
taste
to
be
offended
by
it
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
by
those
who
are
watching
calories
my
suggestion
drink
water
instead
o
slightly
skunky
but
not
that
shocking
since
it
is
packaged
in
a
clear
glass
bottle
the
beer
was
not
offensive
but
that
is
because
there
was
not
much
too
it
to
offend
very
little
flavor
or
smell
to
this
beer
i
probably
would
not
grab
another
of
these
but
i
can
see
why
some
people
could
go
for
this
when
they
are
looking
for
low
alcohol
and
low
calorie
options
this
beer
is
for
those
who
want
to
watch
their
calorie
intake
while
it
is
watered
down
it
is
refreshing
in
the
summer
heat
or
after
a
work
out
beerwise
though
there
is
not
much
i
can
praise
it
for
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
like
water
definitely
not
worth
the
money
purchasing
this
pairs
nicely
with
veggie
dogs
this
beer
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
on
planet
earth
and
i
am
embarrassed
for
the
makers
it
is
like
drinking
heartburn
and
having
no
ware
to
go
to
throw
up
an
abundant
disaster
by
the
makers
of
budweiser
would
rather
drink
wisconsin
club
than
this
tragedy
on
a
bad
day
please
do
not
purchase
this
beer
it
will
only
take
up
space
at
the
grocery
store
and
block
a
more
deserving
brand
an
awful
table
beer
for
modern
times
when
the
zombie
uprising
occurs
this
would
be
a
fine
substitute
for
water
for
sure
this
beer
made
jon
spencer
blues
explosion
flava
pop
in
my
head
who
gots
tha
flava
not
bud
55
there
is
no
need
to
seek
the
aroma
or
any
such
nonsense
obviously
that
is
not
the
point
if
you
are
buying
this
you
know
what
you
are
getting
and
this
is
a
great
ultra
light
beer
overall
while
expecting
the
worst
it
really
was
not
much
different
than
the
standard
light
beer
maybe
just
a
little
less
flavor
if
you
are
really
concerned
about
calories
well
you
probably
arent
if
you
reviewing
big
beers
on
ba
then
this
may
be
a
good
option
but
if
like
me
you
want
something
with
a
bit
more
robust
flavor
then
leave
it
on
its
own
pale
yellow
with
no
head
no
discernible
smell
tastes
grainy
and
slightly
chalky
no
bitterness
but
a
slight
sourness
not
in
a
good
way
it
almost
tastes
rancid
there
is
a
bit
of
body
surprisingly
not
much
and
not
enough
to
be
good
but
it
isnt
the
worst
ive
had
overall
if
i
want
beer
ill
pass
on
this
if
i
want
low
cal
ill
get
a
michelob
ultra
and
if
i
want
a
cheap
big
brew
beer
to
get
drunk
on
ill
find
some
coors
light
this
beer
has
no
place
in
my
rotation
overall
if
you
dont
think
of
this
as
beer
its
a
refreshing
mildly
alcoholic
low
calorie
refreshment
if
you
do
think
of
it
as
beer
its
a
bland
tasteless
excuse
for
a
beer
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
youre
looking
for
pale
fizzy
yellow
almost
non
existant
scent
and
taste
save
for
some
faint
kiss
of
cooked
corn
bubbly
and
uber
light
lifeless
and
uninspired
the
weakest
alcoholic
beverage
i
have
ever
sampled
but
when
faced
with
this
or
other
bmc
light
products
maybe
its
almost
better
to
not
have
anything
to
smell
or
taste
or
digest
overall
this
is
a
poor
excuse
for
a
light
beer
a
lot
of
light
beers
are
at
least
somewhat
refreshing
but
this
doesnt
do
that
i
wont
be
having
this
again
o
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
quite
easily
and
is
not
filling
at
all
since
there
isnt
very
much
to
this
beer
extremely
mild
kick
its
a
watereddown
version
of
a
beer
that
didnt
have
much
to
it
to
begin
with
well
this
is
a
very
light
beer
so
mission
accomplished
but
this
lacks
any
kind
of
flavor
and
the
applelike
off
notes
dominate
both
the
smell
and
the
flavor
pass
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
been
watching
my
caloric
intake
so
i
saw
this
the
other
day
and
figured
lets
try
it
just
to
see
how
bad
it
is
and
also
to
see
it
filled
a
void
that
i
had
for
my
beer
cravings
this
is
literally
watered
down
bud
select
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
golden
color
with
a
highly
carbonated
quickly
fleeting
head
leaves
sparse
speckled
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
cooked
vegetable
corn
generic
beer
nose
no
actual
hop
component
with
a
bit
of
metallic
character
going
on
the
first
sip
has
a
watery
non
discrete
grainy
quality
with
some
more
of
the
cooked
corn
rough
husk
quality
no
herbal
no
hops
just
generic
mass
produced
beer
flavor
ferments
out
to
only
2
4
alcohol
this
is
a
glorified
non
alcoholic
beer
labeled
as
premium
light
beer
im
just
surprised
that
its
only
55
calories
the
only
other
drink
other
than
water
that
ive
had
on
a
regular
basis
has
been
gatorade
g2
at
45
calories
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
pretty
rough
just
because
of
the
graininess
light
flavors
and
high
carbonation
2
4
alcohol
so
go
knock
yourself
out
with
a
sixpack
but
if
if
you
really
want
to
try
a
decent
light
beer
go
get
a
sam
adams
light
this
bud
select
55
does
nothing
for
me
i
gave
this
beer
high
rating
because
it
does
what
its
supposed
to
do
its
not
supposed
to
be
a
strong
smelling
dark
tasteful
beer
and
thats
what
i
want
sometimes
when
its
hot
out
and
i
want
a
cold
beer
to
go
down
fast
this
is
the
one
its
light
and
yes
the
taste
is
very
weak
but
its
kind
of
like
wanting
a
cold
glass
of
ice
water
on
a
hot
day
but
its
still
a
beer
it
cant
be
denied
there
is
a
reason
budweiser
is
the
top
selling
beer
a
lot
of
people
do
like
it
overall
why
yuck
if
the
beer
world
is
slowly
seeing
the
emergence
of
craft
beer
into
a
dominant
force
maybe
ab
thinks
theres
a
shift
in
the
opposite
direction
as
well
ultra
light
beers
ive
had
much
worse
products
than
this
one
but
artistically
this
beer
is
like
thomas
kincaid
this
may
be
good
business
for
ab
and
macro
brewers
but
it
is
not
driven
from
a
deep
and
abiding
love
for
beer
poured
from
can
into
a
pint
glass
body
is
a
clear
pale
straw
color
with
half
a
finger
of
white
bubbly
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
smell
and
taste
were
almost
none
was
able
to
pick
up
on
faint
grains
and
a
metallic
tonic
water
flavor
beer
goes
down
pretty
clean
with
no
hops
flavor
and
too
much
carbonation
like
drinking
a
glass
of
tonic
maybe
i
should
of
addded
vodka
and
a
lime
slightly
astringent
grainy
malt
and
mineral
water
bitterness
up
front
watered
down
faint
cereal
malt
flavors
midpalate
not
even
a
hint
of
sweetness
mineral
water
bitterness
into
the
finish
light
bodied
with
a
very
lively
sodalike
feel
watery
and
almost
tasteless
id
rather
have
4
oz
of
a
good
beer
if
i
were
watching
my
beer
calories
light
straw
lots
of
bubbles
and
small
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
smell
maybe
straw
taste
is
of
carbonated
water
some
straw
corn
mouthfeel
is
very
light
highly
carbonated
there
is
just
no
flavor
here
but
i
guess
that
it
cant
be
avoided
with
55
calories
this
to
me
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
of
all
time
i
grabbed
this
because
it
was
on
sale
for
3
dollars
that
should
have
screamed
to
me
that
it
was
terrible
and
i
poured
it
into
a
regular
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
boring
piss
yellow
and
the
smell
was
just
a
tiny
bit
of
something
and
water
the
taste
was
not
there
you
get
a
little
malt
but
other
than
that
not
much
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
like
highly
carbonated
water
i
couldnt
stand
it
so
it
went
down
the
drain
as
well
as
the
other
5
dont
buy
this
beer
it
is
terrible
i
think
coors
light
might
still
be
a
more
watery
beer
but
while
coors
just
lacks
flavor
for
the
most
part
bud
select
55
is
almost
a
chore
to
drink
it
felt
like
it
took
me
a
half
hour
to
finish
the
bottle
i
think
the
unpleasant
mouthfeel
really
hindered
this
beer
this
is
definitely
not
recommended
even
to
people
who
like
light
beers
pours
clear
pale
gold
with
about
one
inch
of
bone
white
head
no
lacing
aroma
is
a
hint
of
grain
taste
is
clean
crisp
malt
water
a
tiny
amount
of
bitterness
is
found
from
time
to
time
mouthfeel
was
like
a
lower
cabonated
sparkling
water
some
dryness
in
the
finish
if
they
had
a
seperate
style
class
for
ultralight
beer
this
would
fare
a
bit
better
o
the
ads
say
its
the
lightest
beer
in
the
world
they
arent
lying
i
strongly
suggest
sacrificing
an
additional
4060
calories
and
go
with
a
bmc
light
lager
instead
o
its
a
good
idea
for
people
who
like
la
croix
but
want
a
beer
like
flavor
good
for
if
u
want
a
beer
with
dinner
while
on
a
diet
but
thats
it
rjt
ok
let
me
first
say
when
you
see
this
beer
it
is
obvious
what
you
are
going
to
get
half
the
calories
half
the
alcohol
half
the
taste
this
beer
is
perfect
for
those
times
when
you
are
entertaining
friends
and
want
to
be
sociable
without
getting
drunk
it
is
far
better
than
most
na
brews
and
better
than
mgd
64
i
am
actually
impressed
a
bit
by
this
beer
i
drink
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
i
dont
want
too
get
drunk
my
pour
yielded
a
one
finger
head
of
the
whitest
foam
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
and
i
am
glad
i
took
a
good
look
because
it
was
gone
very
quickly
leaving
very
little
lace
very
little
cling
color
is
a
2
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
a
light
aroma
of
cooked
corn
and
wheat
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
but
less
of
it
sweet
corn
and
wheat
maybe
a
slight
touch
of
grapefruit
can
i
say
bland
mouthfeel
equals
fizzy
water
i
guess
if
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
and
pee
a
lot
in
a
night
of
fun
with
friends
and
still
be
sober
to
drive
this
would
be
the
beer
for
you
picked
a
bottle
of
this
at
liquor
barn
its
one
of
those
brews
that
i
know
ill
never
buy
a
6
pack
of
but
want
to
try
for
some
stupid
reason
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
light
gold
color
with
about
a
14
inch
white
head
that
went
away
very
quickly
there
isnt
any
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
not
much
else
it
doesnt
smell
bad
but
it
doesnt
exactly
smell
appealing
either
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
but
there
arent
any
offensive
flavors
mouthfeelbody
is
light
and
watery
but
thats
to
be
expected
for
this
style
of
beer
its
really
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
was
expecting
the
worst
when
i
tried
this
brew
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
hate
to
admit
this
but
if
someone
gave
me
a
bottle
of
this
id
drink
it
not
that
ill
ever
buy
this
again
ive
certainly
drank
worse
beers
im
not
saying
this
is
good
but
for
a
55
calorie
light
lager
its
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
it
is
it
looks
like
beer
in
the
bottle
pours
light
gold
color
white
head
that
quickly
went
flat
and
no
lace
very
weak
cooked
corn
smell
its
hard
to
describe
the
taste
because
there
was
none
watery
weak
mouthfeel
and
not
enough
alcohol
to
make
to
worth
the
price
dont
waste
your
money
if
your
looking
for
beer
its
not
o
if
you
think
this
is
going
to
make
you
lose
weight
you
probably
love
it
but
im
not
on
a
diet
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
aple
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
notes
of
beer
taste
is
also
mild
a
touch
of
malt
not
much
going
on
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
not
the
worst
light
beer
i
have
tried
there
is
nothing
to
seperate
it
from
this
unremarkable
herd
had
to
try
it
just
to
see
what
the
hype
was
all
about
im
still
impressed
that
this
hasnt
been
retired
by
the
brewery
its
one
thing
to
have
a
light
beer
and
its
another
thing
to
have
a
light
light
beer
honestly
im
struggling
to
see
the
purpose
to
this
if
americans
are
getting
too
fat
to
enjoy
a
good
beer
from
time
to
time
then
they
shouldnt
be
having
beer
at
all
this
beer
is
a
waster
of
money
time
ingredients
and
everything
else
that
is
put
into
making
this
id
rather
see
this
removed
from
the
shelves
and
crystal
pepsi
put
in
its
place
d
easy
to
drink
in
that
its
almost
water
not
easy
to
drink
in
that
it
doesnt
taste
that
great
overally
is
this
a
beer
or
some
kind
of
water
i
guess
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
that
was
because
it
was
basically
water
would
i
drink
it
again
no
select
55
was
pale
yellow
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
fizzy
white
head
that
disappeared
instantly
the
smell
was
very
light
and
clean
with
a
bit
of
cereal
grain
the
taste
was
water
with
a
touch
of
grain
thrown
in
the
mouthfeel
was
as
close
to
water
as
you
can
get
with
light
carbonation
drinkability
was
poor
this
is
the
wateriest
beer
that
i
have
ever
tried
here
is
why
i
said
the
above
this
beer
has
an
awful
taste
that
only
get
worse
when
it
gets
warmer
there
is
no
flavor
to
discuss
i
understand
this
is
seems
like
i
am
slamming
this
beer
i
really
am
not
there
isnt
anything
to
write
about
with
this
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
almost
chalky
leaving
your
mouth
dry
the
flavor
is
a
a
generic
american
style
bud
but
with
less
taste
i
would
recommend
you
try
another
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
lot
cal
beer
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
slam
back
its
light
flavor
and
heavy
carbonation
would
be
killer
as
a
patio
beer
but
i
think
it
would
be
more
effort
than
its
worth
having
to
use
the
toilet
often
and
not
getting
the
desired
buzz
effect
ill
stick
to
a
standard
macro
before
this
but
if
im
having
a
heavy
meal
this
might
be
a
compromise
a
notch
below
bud
select
but
a
notch
above
mgd
64
d
not
good
how
do
you
make
a
terrible
beer
even
worse
you
make
budweiser
select
55
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
some
carbonation
with
a
fizzy
little
white
head
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
grainyricy
slight
spice
the
taste
is
watery
at
best
not
much
going
on
here
light
body
not
drinkable
a
waste
of
money
on
this
one
i
saw
this
one
in
the
in
laws
fridge
and
had
forgotten
to
bring
anything
with
me
that
day
so
i
just
went
with
it
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
a
light
golden
amber
comes
through
right
away
again
nothing
really
crazy
here
an
exactly
what
i
had
expected
short
lived
head
and
lively
carbonation
were
common
place
aroma
is
light
grain
muted
and
touched
by
very
light
hop
notes
that
seem
to
provide
something
but
again
so
light
it
is
really
hard
to
detect
crisp
clean
super
light
and
had
virtually
no
aftertaste
not
a
terrible
beer
just
a
non
existent
one
too
light
and
overly
carbonated
but
i
have
had
much
worse
d
harsh
and
fizzy
watery
boring
and
unpleasant
d
i
would
highly
recommend
against
it
its
all
around
bad
d
i
guess
you
could
session
this
is
you
wanted
i
would
take
almost
any
other
light
beer
over
it
though
drink
is
a
zero
but
thats
not
an
option
so
ill
up
it
to
a
full
1
0
another
one
i
drank
as
part
of
losing
a
bet
clear
bottle
poured
into
straight
pint
glass
i
honestly
try
to
find
something
positive
about
every
beer
i
try
but
even
i
couldnt
find
one
nice
thing
to
say
about
this
puppy
clear
urine
color
no
grain
or
hop
scents
almost
zero
flavor
the
same
amount
of
body
as
a
glass
of
water
water
has
a
higher
level
of
drinkability
because
its
not
pretending
its
not
water
only
drink
if
you
lose
a
bet
first
the
obligatory
ba
disclaimer
this
was
left
in
the
fridge
and
was
simply
taking
up
space
more
worthily
occupied
by
some
any
other
brew
i
decided
i
might
as
well
give
it
a
chance
poured
a
very
light
gold
some
vague
sweetness
in
the
aroma
flavor
well
theres
the
rub
there
is
none
or
at
least
almost
none
i
think
i
could
pretty
well
replicate
this
beer
by
taking
a
bud
light
and
mixing
it
with
three
parts
club
soda
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
anyone
even
a
light
beer
fan
would
bother
to
drink
this
it
is
wet
that
is
about
it
a
relative
was
nice
enough
to
leave
a
bottle
of
this
in
the
fridge
for
me
why
not
many
reasons
i
find
out
first
it
pours
without
almost
no
color
and
cant
hold
a
head
or
produce
lacing
with
the
hardest
of
pours
smells
like
a
tiny
bit
of
grain
and
tastes
the
same
no
off
flavors
but
thats
not
enough
to
keep
it
from
getting
the
awful
mark
feel
is
quite
light
and
overly
carbonated
drinks
quickly
but
theres
absolutely
no
reason
to
take
a
second
sip
only
drinkable
for
wimps
and
people
who
want
to
join
in
beer
drinking
with
people
who
drink
actual
beer
drinkability
as
far
as
light
lagers
go
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
definitely
is
lacking
in
complexity
but
helps
you
maintain
a
buzz
after
sampling
other
more
diverse
beers
the
taste
of
select
55
is
decent
i
e
nonoffensive
and
they
go
down
nice
and
easy
its
light
and
pleasantly
carbonated
with
just
enough
alcohol
to
take
the
edge
off
after
a
10
hour
work
day
55
is
also
perfect
for
camping
or
the
beach
when
you
literally
could
down
a
case
of
these
throughout
the
day
and
not
get
hammered
or
sick
no
its
not
an
objectively
great
beer
but
its
perfect
for
what
it
is
and
therefore
one
of
my
favorite
daily
drinkers
overall
not
a
worldclass
beer
by
any
means
yet
i
find
some
surprisingly
pleasant
qualities
with
this
it
smells
ok
tastes
ok
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
which
i
think
is
the
point
of
this
beer
on
these
grounds
i
give
budweiser
select
55
a
thumbs
up
as
a
decent
albeit
not
great
beer
on
to
the
chug
to
end
this
nightmare
drinkability
sure
for
the
few
calories
why
not
or
not
an
ultimate
lawnmover
beer
to
have
a
couple
or
few
before
and
after
mowing
the
lawn
got
this
one
for
free
out
of
a
buddys
fridge
had
just
gotten
back
from
the
foothills
baltic
porter
release
and
needed
to
sober
up
some
this
was
my
first
choice
served
from
bottle
into
a
corona
extra
shaker
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
died
a
very
swift
death
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
wheat
and
urine
the
flavor
was
of
water
grain
and
malt
mostly
water
however
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
my
question
is
where
did
the
flavor
go
however
i
am
glad
that
the
urine
i
picked
up
on
in
the
aroma
stayed
in
the
aroma
and
didnt
hit
my
palate
this
one
was
nice
for
sobering
up
but
thats
about
it
a
friend
left
one
lonely
can
in
my
fridge
after
a
get
together
this
past
weekend
i
figured
id
pop
it
open
last
night
and
finish
it
off
poured
into
a
pils
glass
very
light
yellow
body
with
moderate
carbonation
small
fizzy
head
smell
was
nonexistent
taste
also
was
pretty
much
absent
barely
more
flavor
than
water
mouthfeel
had
some
bubbles
to
it
and
it
was
an
easy
beer
to
drink
which
is
what
ab
is
looking
for
but
at
2
4
abv
whats
the
point
since
its
basically
a
nonalcoholic
beer
youd
be
better
off
drinking
a
lemonade
at
least
that
has
some
flavor
and
low
calories
from
the
12
fl
oz
can
marked
07may10wf09
sampled
on
august
8
2010
the
pour
is
mainly
yellow
with
a
slight
golden
hue
and
a
shortlived
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
rice
adjuncts
but
also
there
is
a
thin
hoppy
coating
as
well
as
a
very
fine
pinelike
scent
the
body
is
not
as
watered
down
as
many
light
beers
i
have
had
but
i
would
not
call
it
medium
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
there
is
a
weak
maltiness
in
the
mix
and
a
clean
hopped
shadow
but
nothing
pounces
out
looking
at
this
beer
in
an
objective
fashion
it
is
very
typical
of
light
macros
but
not
offensive
overallnotes
im
moving
and
under
a
lot
of
stress
so
my
cousin
gave
me
two
of
these
as
a
sort
of
pickmeup
in
all
honesty
im
not
going
to
make
some
sarcastic
remark
about
it
after
all
this
is
a
beer
with
55
calories
how
does
one
review
that
it
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
do
have
the
lightest
beer
possible
that
however
doesnt
absolve
it
of
all
of
the
numerous
faults
it
has
just
not
a
good
beer
and
not
even
worth
the
can
it
comes
in
serving
type
draft
16oz
for
7
50
baseball
price
its
easy
drinking
extremely
light
and
lacks
any
real
flavor
great
if
you
are
looking
to
drink
something
that
resembles
beer
but
this
is
not
what
is
beer
is
about
this
is
12
ounces
of
liquid
to
rehyrate
with
in
between
tasty
beers
im
actually
quite
surprised
the
only
way
that
this
is
truly
offensive
is
in
its
concept
as
for
its
execution
it
is
just
a
very
very
mild
lager
no
skunk
factor
whatsoever
just
like
your
goto
grocery
store
bottled
water
however
that
defence
falls
short
this
is
supposed
to
be
beer
crystal
clear
and
a
darker
yellow
almost
gold
than
i
expected
a
fizzy
white
cap
disappeared
shortly
after
the
pour
leaving
nothing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
light
grainy
aroma
faint
apple
slightly
vegetal
not
much
to
talk
about
really
low
bitterness
minerals
cereal
grains
metallic
and
watery
finish
thin
bodied
sharp
carbonation
super
dry
sort
of
tastes
like
carbonated
water
with
a
little
bit
of
flavour
added
not
much
point
here
as
i
expected
time
to
move
along
d
you
would
probably
have
to
drink
3
or
4
fairly
quickly
to
feel
the
effects
not
worth
it
to
me
but
maybe
for
some
if
you
like
paying
excessively
high
prices
for
bottled
water
this
beer
is
for
you
the
only
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
that
is
good
is
that
its
good
for
barbeques
and
partys
where
you
dont
want
to
get
drunk
but
you
do
want
something
to
drink
appearance
seems
no
different
than
any
other
macro
with
light
golden
body
and
a
thin
crisp
dissapating
head
smell
is
clean
that
has
a
light
aroma
of
grainy
adjuncts
taste
of
light
grain
that
is
definably
watered
down
that
ends
dry
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
id
have
to
say
that
amongst
the
ultras
that
ive
tried
so
far
this
aint
to
bad
id
prefer
this
over
bl
bl
lime
and
sunset
wheat
this
is
not
good
even
for
a
macro
light
lager
why
bother
might
as
well
drink
tonic
water
in
fact
i
probably
would
prefer
to
would
be
less
cardboardy
it
has
good
drinkable
but
taste
is
so
light
that
if
your
looking
for
some
sort
of
beer
flavor
but
if
you
want
a
light
beer
this
is
not
for
you
get
a
real
light
beer
this
is
not
a
good
beer
and
should
be
avoided
one
thing
select
55
is
is
thirstquenching
due
to
the
lack
of
any
flavor
or
body
i
suppose
one
could
hang
out
after
a
long
jog
or
ride
while
wearing
spandex
with
their
buddies
and
quench
their
thirst
with
these
other
than
that
there
is
really
no
place
for
this
beer
in
a
mans
fridge
budweiser
select
55
is
a
light
beer
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
2
40
select
55
is
the
lighter
of
budweiser
select
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
smell
white
head
the
smell
is
light
with
a
hit
of
grains
and
malts
this
is
just
a
water
down
beer
no
taste
at
all
you
pick
up
hits
of
beer
taste
the
drinkability
is
ok
it
is
smooth
and
clean
this
beer
is
like
drinking
busch
na
over
all
i
would
not
buy
this
unless
you
like
light
light
beers
not
the
greatest
anheuserbusch
brew
i
had
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
2
out
5
do
yourself
a
favor
and
at
the
bar
or
package
store
select
a
different
brew
12oz
clear
bottle
purchased
cheaply
at
the
local
hannafords
pours
a
crystal
clear
very
light
straw
yellow
with
an
initial
white
head
that
dissipates
almost
immediately
smells
mostly
like
cooked
corn
with
hints
of
malt
in
the
background
tastes
very
light
cooked
corn
dms
and
slight
hints
at
bready
malt
character
toward
the
finish
is
all
im
getting
extremely
lightbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
no
surprise
since
this
basically
comes
off
as
beerflavored
carbonated
water
dull
and
lifeless
albeit
somewhat
refreshing
drinkability
yeesh
the
stuff
they
have
the
nerve
to
slap
the
word
premium
onto
steer
clear
of
this
one
friends
bud
55
is
an
awful
beverage
for
those
that
feel
bud
light
is
simply
too
rich
and
filling
it
is
the
most
watered
down
beer
i
have
ever
tryed
i
like
the
regular
bud
select
but
a
55cal
beerthey
need
a
new
catagory
supper
light
beer
with
miller
having
really
light
beer
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
bud
and
coors
will
come
out
with
one
to
who
counts
calories
so
much
they
will
drink
this
stuff
thank
the
beer
gods
for
sam
adams
light
d
yeah
though
a
bong
this
would
go
down
smooth
poured
a
clear
nearly
colorless
into
a
pint
glass
a
thin
white
head
that
disappeared
instantly
more
like
a
soda
water
head
than
a
beer
head
smelled
like
a
soda
water
also
hell
tasted
like
soda
water
too
no
flavor
no
texture
no
reason
to
drink
it
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
ten
seconds
into
absolutely
no
lacing
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
viewed
a
beer
with
this
little
lacing
i
mean
usually
there
is
at
least
a
tiny
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
but
not
in
this
beer
it
really
doesnt
look
like
a
beer
the
aroma
seems
to
have
gone
where
ever
the
head
did
that
is
to
say
it
smells
like
water
upon
closer
inspection
there
is
a
little
something
there
making
it
smell
more
like
tainted
water
truly
awful
it
would
be
better
if
it
just
didnt
have
a
smell
the
taste
is
like
carbonated
water
the
mouthfeel
is
the
thinnest
i
have
every
encountered
in
a
beer
which
makes
sense
being
that
this
beer
is
only
55
calories
and
a
mere
2
4
abv
i
can
handle
the
thin
body
but
this
beers
under
carbonation
is
a
huge
detractor
i
never
thought
id
say
a
beer
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
is
under
carbonated
but
this
beer
truly
is
there
is
some
carbonation
to
it
but
not
enough
for
a
light
lager
overall
this
is
a
really
bad
beer
i
will
never
drink
this
again
d
after
a
couple
of
drinks
im
bored
really
whats
the
point
anymore
drainpour
this
beer
is
so
light
it
makes
michelob
ultra
look
like
yeti
notes
if
someone
is
so
concerned
about
the
calories
in
beer
that
they
cant
even
drink
a
typical
light
beer
they
probably
shouldnt
be
drinking
beer
just
drink
water
instead
of
this
stuff
d
if
drinkability
is
characteristic
of
a
beers
ease
of
consumption
sho
nuff
if
i
was
struck
blind
and
asked
someone
for
a
glass
of
water
they
could
fool
me
with
this
thought
i
might
accuse
them
of
having
peed
in
my
glass
with
this
i
wrap
up
my
reviewing
days
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
slight
yeast
metallic
very
slight
citrus
and
grain
fits
the
style
of
a
light
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
metallic
yeast
pale
malt
and
grain
overall
almost
no
body
definitely
drinkable
but
so
is
water
dif
i
could
get
past
the
taste
i
could
probably
drink
buds
supply
of
this
brew
and
id
be
sober
enough
to
remember
just
how
horrible
each
one
was
25
avoid
like
the
plague
this
is
just
overkill
and
the
very
reason
why
abinbev
is
cannibalizing
itself
in
the
name
of
profits
they
just
dont
understand
that
its
not
calories
but
rather
carbs
waste
of
money
the
two
fingers
worth
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
were
reminiscent
of
the
blowing
drifting
snow
out
my
back
window
the
head
held
up
so
poorly
that
i
wished
that
the
snow
could
take
its
cue
from
the
beer
can
nothing
cheer
me
up
today
the
color
was
a
pretty
deepgold
with
nequality
clarity
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
on
this
snowwhite
afternoon
that
was
nice
nose
had
a
faint
lagersweetness
but
only
faint
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
with
only
a
light
sweet
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
equally
watery
and
did
not
leave
me
with
much
of
any
taste
pleasant
or
not
it
was
really
a
bland
beer
overall
and
while
not
worthy
of
outright
avoidance
i
would
not
seek
it
out
unless
you
are
on
a
canquest
like
i
said
i
could
drink
this
by
the
keg
im
going
to
be
using
bud
select
55
instead
of
water
on
some
of
my
longer
endurance
rides
this
spring
drinkability
this
goes
down
like
water
as
it
should
the
drinkability
is
extremely
high
even
though
its
not
tasty
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
low
abv
helps
i
had
to
laugh
when
i
saw
this
in
my
favorite
beer
store
as
it
was
a
new
item
so
it
beats
miller
64
by
9
calories
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
it
looked
to
be
okay
but
its
aroma
was
mostly
of
corn
and
faint
wheat
the
taste
was
better
than
i
expected
though
it
lacked
any
after
effects
other
than
mild
carbonation
i
was
hoping
to
find
a
clean
beer
that
was
void
of
both
meaningful
flavor
and
flaws
looks
like
i
was
right
about
the
meaningful
flavor
omition
i
dont
know
what
to
say
aside
from
im
glad
it
was
free
to
say
it
looks
like
a
light
lager
would
be
inaccurate
it
was
lighter
and
more
clear
than
any
other
beer
ive
seen
i
cant
say
i
smelled
anything
is
that
possible
as
for
the
flavor
it
honestly
tastes
like
a
5050
mix
of
bud
light
and
water
guess
what
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
thin
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
takes
off
its
low
calorie
has
no
awful
bitterness
that
most
adjunct
lagers
have
and
its
low
abv
makes
it
extremely
sessionable
i
imagine
youd
have
to
drink
a
case
to
get
a
buzz
which
would
counteract
the
low
calorie
effect
i
guess
you
win
some
and
you
lose
some
had
this
at
a
new
years
eve
get
together
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
which
faded
immediately
almost
no
aroma
some
cooked
rice
is
about
it
same
for
the
flavor
not
much
going
on
here
either
feels
thin
and
watery
carbonation
is
ok
this
was
a
boring
beer
to
drink
drinkability
is
well
like
seltzer
sure
i
could
chug
this
like
water
but
why
would
i
want
to
at
only
2
abv
its
not
even
worth
the
effort
as
an
alcohol
delivery
device
verdict
if
you
want
a
buzz
without
too
many
calories
bud
light
already
exists
if
you
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
there
are
plenty
of
alternatives
out
there
if
you
want
to
cut
the
flavor
calorie
count
and
alcohol
content
off
a
bud
light
in
half
potable
tap
water
is
available
in
almost
all
american
households
so
why
the
hell
does
this
exist
d
it
would
be
impressive
if
you
finish
the
first
bottle
budweiser
select
55
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
from
a
twelve
ounce
can
the
aroma
is
mildly
grainy
i
cant
particularly
detect
any
hops
or
malt
the
taste
is
predictably
mild
a
touch
grainy
and
thats
about
it
watery
is
probably
the
best
description
for
this
one
okay
for
what
it
is
just
not
what
most
of
the
people
on
this
site
are
looking
for
pale
yellow
gold
with
a
head
thats
gone
in
30
seconds
now
it
looks
like
apple
juice
it
smells
like
an
empty
glass
of
beer
what
i
mean
is
it
smells
like
a
glass
that
contained
a
skunked
heineken
that
beer
was
drank
then
the
glass
was
left
on
the
counter
overnight
thats
what
this
beer
smells
like
the
taste
jesus
water
this
tastes
like
cornade
lemonade
but
made
with
corn
water
mouthfeel
flat
terrible
i
hope
these
horrible
beers
go
away
whats
the
point
if
people
dont
like
beer
they
should
drink
something
else
overall
i
will
not
be
buying
this
one
very
bland
bud
select
55
pours
a
light
pale
yellow
the
skunky
aroma
covers
up
anything
else
that
might
be
there
the
flavor
is
sulfery
and
slightly
grainy
more
proof
that
a
clear
bottle
is
a
bad
idea
this
beer
is
about
as
close
to
water
as
it
gets
not
worth
it
if
youre
dieting
go
for
mixed
drinks
or
go
without
and
in
my
humble
opinion
trying
to
cut
back
on
calories
andor
losing
weight
is
no
excuse
for
making
or
drinking
a
beverage
this
flavorless
had
to
buy
this
just
to
say
ive
had
it
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
beer
is
as
it
appears
in
the
clear
glass
bottle
a
very
light
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
fizzy
bubbles
on
the
glass
and
comprising
a
large
foamy
white
head
the
nose
is
virtually
nonexistent
what
is
there
reminds
me
slightly
of
vomit
if
ab
was
going
for
the
absolute
closest
to
water
you
can
get
and
still
call
it
a
beer
theyve
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
goes
down
just
like
carbonated
water
with
only
a
very
slight
whisper
of
budweiser
at
the
finish
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
because
again
how
drinkable
is
water
very
im
sure
this
will
get
beat
up
bad
just
because
it
is
an
ab
product
but
honestly
could
i
get
some
beer
with
my
beer
pale
yellow
fizzy
carbonation
almost
no
smell
no
tase
at
all
none
tastes
wet
with
some
bubbles
this
beer
is
completely
pointless
im
not
one
of
those
snobs
who
thinks
there
is
no
place
for
a
mass
produced
yellow
beer
sometimes
you
want
a
simple
cheap
lager
that
you
can
down
all
day
but
even
i
cant
defend
this
if
they
got
it
down
to
55
calories
what
is
it
made
of
its
not
even
that
drinkable
because
it
is
so
boring
its
like
drinking
a
case
of
bottled
water
you
probably
could
but
why
if
this
is
what
you
have
to
drink
in
order
to
drink
beer
you
dont
like
beer
at
less
than
4
youd
be
bloated
from
drinking
this
before
even
feeling
a
slight
buzz
but
i
suppose
as
water
its
drinkable
d
great
for
drinking
games
since
its
as
easy
to
chug
as
water
and
wont
get
you
drunk
other
than
that
you
have
no
reason
to
drink
this
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
which
should
be
reason
for
a
score
of
5
however
the
fact
that
i
would
not
be
buzzed
combined
with
the
illusion
that
im
drinking
dirty
water
lowers
the
drinkabilty
score
to
1
overall
just
an
awful
beer
id
rather
have
a
beer
belly
than
resort
to
this
crap
ever
again
not
to
mention
the
drunkability
was
an
f
i
drank
4
of
these
in
a
2
hour
time
period
no
buzz
nada
all
i
felt
was
a
full
belly
of
club
soda
with
maybe
a
shot
of
real
beer
please
unless
you
are
a
light
weight
dont
even
waste
your
time
on
this
terrible
excuse
for
a
beer
yuck
very
thin
and
watery
flavor
i
wont
have
another
one
its
as
drinkable
as
a
cold
glass
of
tap
water
so
i
guess
ok
but
why
bother
drinkability
depends
how
you
look
at
it
the
sessionability
is
ridiculous
so
in
that
regard
yes
its
drinkable
on
the
other
han
i
like
to
consider
the
flavor
profile
and
whether
it
brings
me
back
for
another
sip
in
that
regard
this
is
easily
the
most
boring
beer
ive
ever
had
ive
found
more
enjoyment
and
flavor
in
nonalcoholic
beer
just
really
a
bad
gimic
beer
and
its
sad
to
think
that
this
will
pass
as
beer
to
the
masses
d
to
be
honest
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
anything
and
because
of
that
it
is
the
best
out
of
all
the
bmc
flagship
beers
haha
clear
urine
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
burns
off
quickly
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
not
offensive
because
there
is
none
very
light
tasting
almost
like
a
nonalcoholic
beer
with
a
sourness
in
the
finish
watery
with
seltzery
carbonation
another
low
alcohol
diet
beer
with
no
flavor
why
bother
so
there
it
is
not
particularly
good
but
particularly
easy
to
ignore
bubbly
as
all
hell
simple
to
drink
but
who
drinks
lame
beer
to
not
get
a
buzz
at
2
4
i
dont
get
it
much
one
scenario
could
be
if
you
have
to
show
up
at
a
party
with
bad
beer
you
can
drink
a
number
of
these
and
then
drive
home
aok
though
normally
if
you
want
something
fizzy
and
low
in
calories
reach
for
a
diet
pepsi
max
or
a
coke
zero
those
are
pretty
good
even
though
this
is
the
lightest
malted
barley
beverage
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
lifetime
at
least
not
without
monetary
compensation
i
must
still
take
my
hat
off
to
bud
their
marketing
department
is
awesome
if
they
can
get
people
to
buy
this
they
should
use
thair
powers
for
good
and
maybe
bring
peace
to
the
middle
east
or
get
lindsey
lohan
to
eat
a
damn
sandwich
it
does
however
get
the
extra
12
point
because
you
could
probably
replace
water
with
this
stuff
and
still
maintain
life
hell
its
more
sanitary
than
most
peoples
tap
water
i
call
this
beer
the
pacifier
beer
when
you
want
a
real
beer
but
you
just
cant
have
it
stick
this
in
your
mouth
and
youll
shut
up
for
a
while
i
pray
this
beer
never
makes
it
out
of
the
test
markets
and
i
should
be
flogged
for
buying
a
sixer
just
to
review
it
last
time
i
drank
this
there
was
a
family
crisis
it
might
just
be
me
but
this
beer
has
a
smell
and
taste
that
reminds
me
ever
so
faintly
of
the
way
nail
polish
remover
smells
i
found
it
pretty
undrinkable
and
poured
it
down
the
drain
really
horrible
i
guess
the
draw
is
that
its
90
calories
at
6
a
friend
left
it
in
the
fridge
decided
i
would
try
to
see
what
brewed
the
hard
way
was
all
about
half
way
through
the
beer
i
accidentally
knocked
my
glass
over
and
broke
it
i
think
god
was
sending
me
a
message
like
it
better
than
regular
bud
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
better
abv
than
other
bud
products
but
has
a
different
after
taste
this
beer
is
pretty
good
pours
a
thin
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
smells
slightly
metallic
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
just
bud
light
with
a
bit
more
alcohol
on
the
finish
not
a
fan
of
the
beer
but
i
can
see
why
its
popular
this
is
a
good
once
in
a
while
beer
this
is
basically
a
light
malt
liquor
and
rather
unique
as
it
is
its
not
very
flavorful
but
its
also
not
terrible
this
beer
would
be
good
for
someone
who
likes
light
lagers
but
wants
a
bit
more
kick
better
than
regular
bud
light
a
little
more
body
and
flavor
i
guess
the
little
extra
alcohol
content
helps
it
dont
let
the
low
ratings
fool
you
it
a
pretty
good
drink
finally
found
a
cheap
beer
that
is
decent
enough
to
border
on
enjoyable
smooth
on
the
front
slightly
sweet
and
ever
so
slightly
spicy
on
the
finish
almost
as
if
they
made
a
5050
mix
of
club
soda
and
duvel
for
a
dollar
more
for
a
12
pack
then
regular
bud
light
thus
definitely
will
be
my
go
to
party
session
beer
their
they
go
again
keeping
horrible
beer
alive
better
than
bud
light
still
bud
drinkable
pouted
from
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
very
pale
straw
color
crystal
clear
there
is
zero
head
and
no
lacing
there
is
more
smell
than
most
lagers
mostly
grain
and
small
flecks
of
citrus
no
hops
to
speak
of
taste
is
much
of
the
same
malted
grain
flavor
no
alcohol
on
the
palate
no
hoppy
bitterness
fair
for
this
style
of
beer
feel
is
a
bit
odd
feels
much
like
tonic
water
thin
wispy
with
loads
of
cola
carbonation
this
is
the
second
platinum
ive
tried
and
it
is
my
last
taste
is
smooth
and
completely
better
than
any
other
budweiser
beers
if
you
drink
it
fast
enough
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
and
gets
you
buzzed
usually
can
be
found
for
a
buck
at
kroger
we
and
wont
drink
again
beer
for
college
chicks
looking
to
get
drunk
faster
putrid
i
dont
understand
why
this
exists
just
buy
good
beer
folks
solid
sessionable
macro
it
is
what
it
is
wasnt
sure
it
was
possible
to
be
worse
than
bud
light
but
you
pulled
it
off
looks
great
but
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
very
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
basically
a
stronger
version
that
taste
almost
the
same
as
bud
light
but
for
a
more
stressful
day
does
not
taste
bad
at
all
actually
surprised
it
wasnt
worse
not
an
ipa
but
not
bad
i
feel
most
of
the
poor
reviews
come
from
people
comparing
this
to
craft
beers
this
is
not
a
craft
beer
and
it
isnt
trying
to
be
one
this
is
a
beer
for
bbqs
and
hot
days
its
crisp
clean
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
weigh
you
down
it
also
is
good
for
night
life
because
is
doesnt
make
you
as
tired
as
other
heavier
beers
for
its
purpose
i
feel
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
fuck
no
jeeez
you
would
think
this
stuff
is
brewed
with
toxic
waste
and
camel
piss
from
so
many
of
the
ultra
poor
reviews
here
on
beer
snob
advocate
why
is
it
that

like
this
beer
simply
because
it
is
a
cheaper
beer
that
i
think
tastes
good
i
think
its
kinda
sweet
which
is
what
i
like
about
it
it
has
a
high
alc
volume
that
i
like
for
a
cheep
beer
and
i
disagree
with
people
that
say
it
tastes
like
regular
bud
light
it
does
has
a
different
flavor
as
far
as
that
goes
like
i
said
its
sweeter
to
me
anyways
and
has
a
nice
volume
the
crown
from
the
glass
isnt
huge
but
thats
expected
with
this
beer
overall
i
enjoy
it
over
other
common
bought
beers
and
the
glasses
are
cool
and
so
are
the
thin

was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
i
enjoy
bud
lite
to
an
extend
and
was
hoping
this
would
add
a
little
more
flavor
and
profile
than
a
typical
bud
lite
it
is
a
little
heavier
but
overall
i
thought
the
taste
was
similar
to
that
of
bud
lite

a

carbonated
ultra
light
beverage
well
recommended
for
those
who
hate
the
taste
of
beer
and
want
to
get
happy
rather
quickly
keep
this
stuff
away
from
little
kids
please
i
think
they
would
guzzle
it
down
thinking
it
was
some
type
of
child
beverage
like
carbonated
apple
juice
the
can
is
strange
too
with
a
bit
of
a

it
tastes

with

the
body
is

the

5this
is
an
interesting
one
the
most
confusing
part
to
me
is
how
they
are
able
to
pass
this
as
a
light
beer
it
only
has
a
handful
of
calories
less
than
regular
budweiser
i
think
it
would
have
made
more
sense
to
simply
call
it
budweiser
platinum
i
think
the
main
purpose
was
to
produce
a
beer
with
a
slightly
boosted
abv
because
thats
what
it
tastes
like
a
bud
with
some
more
alcohol
that
makes
it
a
better
choice
than
bud
or
bud
light
if
you
want
to
get
wasted
its
redeeming
qualites
stop
there

high

beer
if
the
goal
is
beer
to
get
you
drunk
davidford89
i
predict
it
will
be
a
fart
in
the
pan
like
lots
of
other
bud
products
wish
they
would
trade
it
for
bud
dry
reprise
of
course
i
may
have
been
too
young
to
know
that
bud
dry
was
just
another
crappy
macro
the
last
time
it
was
available
i
really
like
it
glass
dimpled
mug
mehhh
as
expected
this
beer
sucks
i
guess
i
would
call
it
better
than
regular
bud
lite
but
then
regular
bl
is
one
the
nastiest
beers
on
the
planet
one
and
done
for
me
overall
if
i
could
go
back
in
time
and
have
the
money
id
only
play
beer
pong
with
this
beer
it
really
hides
the
6
0
very
well
honestly
it
doesnt
taste
offensive
at
first
but
it
develops
into
something
awful
the
extra
malt
just
adds
the
same
malt
flavors
but
just
more
of
them
feels
light
and
crisp
d
so
despite
the
incredibly
upscale
packaging
this
pretty
much
tastes
like
bud
light
with
some
nutrasweet
in
it
in
fact
i
am
pretty
sure
i
just
cracked
the
secret
of
bud
light
platinum
time
to
stake
out
the
local
ab
brewery
and
try
to
get
a
picture
of
the
truck
delivering
loads
of
fake
sugar
finishes
like
sour
milk
very
gross
it
gives
me
gas
and
a
headache
i
cant
stand
it
o
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
for
a
light
lager
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
for
what
it
is
its
excellent
o
well
im
trying
to
be
objective
here
i
gave
it
low
scores
but
its
not
horrible
it
doesnt
taste
like
hot
trash
it
didnt
give
me
herpes
yet
it
just
has
almost
no
aroma
or
taste
so
how
can
i
give
it
much
of
a
score
basically
some
mild
adjuncts
and
cereal
grain
and
that
is
it
it
is
drinkable
of
course
why
wouldnt
it
be
its
not
really
all
that
far
from
water
whats
more
drinkable
than
water
if
i
had
no
other
options
and
i
wanted
to
get
drunk
quickly
and
easily
why
not
pick
this
beer
i
recommend
it
but
beer
snobs
will
more
than
likely
diss
it
as
it
is
not
complex
or
a
micro
brew
overall
this
is
an
insult
to
the
word
beer
you
see
beer
should
be
a
wonderful
thing
not
an
ugly
abomination
like
this
im
going
to
sum
it
up
in
one
phrase
directed
at
anheuserbusch
this
beer
is
bad
and
you
should
feel
bad
snappy
blue
bottle
pours
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
finger
of
foam
that
persists
smell
is
breads
and
grains
taste
reminded
me
immedately
of
a
sort
of
lightweight
champale
maybe
a
low
sugar
moscato
i
only
get
the
faintest
hint
of
beer
taste
its
mildly
sweet
fizzy
grainy
you
can
detect
the
bud
light
family
genes
as
well
we
worked
our
way
through
half
a
twelve
pack
after
drinking
several
from
the
bottle
one
from
a
glass
my
brother
chris
added
half
a
bottle
to
some
orange
juice
and
stated
that
it
made
a
passably
decent
mimosa
im
sure
people
that
dislike
the
beer
flavor
of
beer
will
really
go
for
platinum
a
cold
one
on
a
hot
day
would
be
fine
but
i
like
the
taste
of
beer
and
therefore
would
pass
on
this
this
particular
brew
is
uneventful
slightly
sweeter
mouthfeel
than
the
original
bud
light
and
has
a
sharper
acidity
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
bad
stale
bread
i
would
try
it
once
to
get
it
out
of
your
system
then
to
other
brews
it
is
i
would
say
its
not
an
improvement
over
bud
light
but
its
definitely
stronger
ill
be
enjoying
that
later
tonight
at
lazer
tag
t
again
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
with
nothing
else
in
there
to
stand
up
to
it
some
boiled
corn
grain
and
bready
yeast
on
the
finish
that
grows
as
it
warms
this
is
far
from
being
the
worst
thing
out
there
but
its
still
not
good
odthought
it
would
be
worse
but
it
still
blew
overall
its
bad
when
a
beer
makes
you
want
a
bud
light
anheuserbush
sure
can
market
a
product
this
beer
accomplishes
the
goal
of
what
i
believe
many
of
the
drinkers
who
buy
this
product
want
to
accomplish
get
a
buzz
faster
i
was
suckered
into
purchasing
this
beer
from
the
marketing
campaign
and
the
electric
blue
bottle
this
beer
tastes
much
like
its
bud
light
roots
a
ricecorn
blended
taste
with
an
almost
maltliquor
mouth
feel
many
people
who
enjoy
bud
light
will
probably
enjoy
this
as
well
o
i
find
coors
to
be
better
than
budweiser
in
general
because
i
get
a
nasty
aftertaste
in
ab
products
this
however
was
actually
quite
clean
and
crisp
given
the
choice
this
trumps
regular
bl
pretty
drinkable
actually
and
not
terrible
as
it
warms
overall
a
disappointment
and
i
wasnt
expecting
much
i
hope
my
wife
wants
to
drink
the
rest
of
six
pack
tasted
similar
more
apple
and
soggy
graininess
it
has
a
touch
more
malt
flavor
than
standard
issue
bud
light
mild
taste
flaccid
feel
utterly
dull
and
insipid
flavor
wise
biting
astringent
carbonation
watery
aftertaste
pretty
much
bullshit
any
way
you
slice
it
whee
liquid
garbage
really
not
much
to
say
that
im
sure
hasnt
been
said
already
no
real
appearance
to
speak
of
not
really
any
smell
or
taste
that
im
guessing
was
the
intention
overall
really
just
a
alcohol
delivery
device
and
im
my
opinion
not
a
very
good
one
bourbon
works
faster
and
taste
better
in
my
opinion
overall
this
beer
is
not
good
i
got
this
beer
from
a
party
where
the
buyer
not
me
didnt
want
it
i
wonder
why
so
i
took
it
home
six
free
beers
why
not
for
the
price
i
have
seen
this
selling
for
no
way
if
im
going
macro
give
me
busch
light
coors
or
natty
i
picked
up
a
12
pack
in
bottles
because
i
was
curious
about
bud
coming
out
with
a
6
abv
and
they
offered
a
4
00
rebate
i
thought
ill
give
it
try
for
8
00
since
its
the
holidays
and
i
like
to
keep
a
few
lite
fizzy
beers
on
hand
for
my
family
in
a
word
terrible
it
has
no
smell
taste
mouthfeel
lacing
or
head
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
would
never
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
note
as
far
as
macro
beers
go
i
actually
do
like
bud
products
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
but
it
probably
would
not
be
something
i
would
get
again
if
i
had
a
choice
between
this
and
bud
light
i
would
take
the
regular
bud
light
wow
just
wow
lets
take
a
bad
product
increase
the
strength
but
make
it
taste
worse
i
think
theyve
done
that
it
was
fizzy
yellow
and
clear
smells
like
nothing
corn
maybe
it
tasted
like
corn
and
water
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
highly
carbonated
overall
this
is
just
as
bad
if
not
worse
than
bud
light
simply
amazing
o
ive
certainly
had
worse
beers
but
i
wont
have
this
one
again
any
time
soon
thanks
to
my
trading
partner
i
wont
have
to
waste
money
on
my
own
6pk
overall
drinkability
pretty
awful
but
it
is
a
novelty
not
worth
it
though
just
bought
my
first
pack
of
this
the
6
0
alcohol
caught
my
attention
on
the
commercials
but
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
disappointing
less
taste
than
bud
light
but
more
alcohol
interesting
you
can
really
taste
the
booze
in
this
its
almost
like
a
weak
mixed
drink
no
real
beer
taste
tho
disappointing
worse
than
bud
light
better
than
bud
light
chelada
there
you
have
it
o
well
its
better
than
plain
bud
light
its
got
that
going
for
it
which
is
nice
a
half
finger
head
forms
the
smell
is
of
barely
taste
is
sweeter
than
bud
light
with
a
less
bitter
aftertaste
the
beer
tastes
and
looks
watered
down
but
really
its
just
lack
of
hop
flavoring
far
more
watered
down
than
its
nonlight
version
just
like
bud
light
light
malt
sweetness
up
front
some
honey
but
turns
to
sugardusted
corn
cereal
pretty
quick
light
graininess
near
the
finish
along
with
a
hint
of
ethanol
and
a
blip
of
peppery
hops
lightbodied
with
a
fizzy
soday
feel
corny
overall
i
dont
really
understand
why
this
beer
exists
marketing
and
niche
wiselight
malt
liquor
might
be
a
better
style
and
i
also
dont
understand
why
anyone
would
try
it
again
not
terrible
but
not
good
finish
clean
crisp
refreshing
dry
o
its
kind
of
bad
i
think
i
prefer
a
normal
bud
light
this
is
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
another
swing
and
a
miss
now
to
decide
to
pour
it
down
my
throat
or
the
sink
overall
i
would
drink
this
over
bud
light
would
use
as
the
foil
in
a
mystery
cooler
d
hot
day
or
a
quick
buzz
not
a
bad
option
for
abv
and
lightness
what
the
hell
were
they
thinking
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
fire
the
brewmaster
and
the
idiots
who
approved
this
mess
i
brewed
an
ipa
and
on
my
first
shot
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
they
were
trying
to
do
with
this
one
its
flavor
profile
is
incredibly
light
and
is
dominated
by
that
applelike
off
flavor
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
so
i
wont
say
im
disappointed
ill
be
passing
on
this
in
the
future
o
not
the
worst
light
beer
ive
ever
had
it
must
be
because
of
the
citrus
overtones
this
one
peresents
if
i
wanted
to
do
nothing
but
get
drunk
this
would
be
akin
to
a
malt
liquor
minus
the
malt
i
will
not
purchase
this
beer
and
am
glad
my
neighbor
gave
me
one
to
come
to
this
conclusion
as
far
as
light
lagers
go
this
really
isnt
bad
bud
light
is
prolly
my
favorite
out
of
all
the
macro
light
lagers
but
thats
not
saying
much
as
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
this
is
hardly
any
different
than
regular
bud
light
maybe
the
slightest
bit
more
taste
but
still
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
and
even
avoid
drinking
if
it
was
free
and
i
really
dont
understand
the
whole
concept
behind
this
beer
all
i
can
make
of
it
is
a
ploy
to
alcoholics
o
pretty
much
what
i
expected
meh
o
why
did
i
do
this
oh
well
at
least
now
i
know
i
wont
have
to
worry
about
ticking
this
any
longer
below
average
light
lager
o
its
a
good
idea
for
people
who
like
light
beer
and
want
to
get
drunk
but
for
those
of
us
who
actually
have
taste
buds
and
a
functioning
brain
id
definitely
avoid
this
beer
overall
this
is
actually
much
more
flavorful
then
the
average
light
beer
and
its
mouthfeel
blows
the
normal
light
beer
out
of
the
water
it
still
is
very
one
dimensional
however
with
its
taste
consists
nearly
entirely
of
corn
better
than
the
average
light
beer
that
is
for
sure
but
not
something
to
pine
for
poured
into
glass
it
looks
like
its
counter
parts
but
very
carbonated
smell
was
like
bud
but
with
a
little
bit
more
behind
the
smell
maybe
an
extra
sniff
of
hops
it
taste
pretty
good
to
me
it
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
think
its
one
of
anheuserbuschs
coolest
creation
lately
i
mean
more
alcohol
than
bud
and
less
calories
i
mean
cant
go
wrong
there
didnt
know
what
to
expect
when
i
was
about
to
try
this
certainly
has
a
unique
bottle
that
stands
out
i
actually
didnt
mind
this
they
bumped
it
up
to
a
6
0
which
i
thought
was
smart
went
down
alot
easier
than
i
anticipated
which
could
be
trouble
for
people
who
throw
back
a
lot
at
a
time
pretty
smooth
bitter
aftertaste
wasnt
too
high
on
the
smell
but
overall
didnt
mind
it
overall
whats
the
point
of
this
beer
its
bud
light
with
a
higher
abv
o
if
i
wanted
to
get
hammered
this
would
be
easy
to
do
it
with
has
little
flavor
and
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
however
if
i
want
to
enjoy
a
cheap
beer
then
this
isnt
it
this
gimmick
of
a
beer
is
definitely
the
6
abv
and
that
its
platinum
o
good
college
dorm
room
beer
im
sure
itll
be
a
big
hit
in
that
age
bracket
for
beer
enthusiasts
though
its
probably
not
even
worth
trying
honestly
not
sure
if
this
is
really
beer
just
diluted
alcohol
begs
for
a
twist
of
lime
or
something
to
give
it
more
flavor
pours
out
a
light
yellow
straw
hue
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
very
little
retention
no
lacing
and
high
carbonation
can
hardly
smell
anything
in
this
beer
even
though
i
get
hints
of
the
typical
old
corn
and
old
rice
smell
of
the
typical
american
light
beer
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
rice
some
sweet
syrups
followed
by
alcohol
and
finishes
off
with
hints
of
sweet
malts
if
there
is
any
hops
in
this
i
cant
taste
them
the
mouthfeel
is
a
very
light
bodied
and
watered
down
beer
that
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
good
if
you
want
a
light
beer
to
try
to
get
drunk
off
of
and
dont
care
for
taste
but
if
you
care
about
taste
and
quality
this
beer
is
not
for
you
and
it
is
not
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
designed
to
pack
more
punch
than
your
average
light
beer
all
the
while
delivering
the
same
llittle
flavor
the
scientists
at
ab
have
successfully
done
this
for
those
beer
drinkers
who
hate
the
taste
of
beer
o
you
cant
taste
the
additional
alcohol
6
vs
4
5
but
i
would
take
a
normal
bl
over
this
any
day
my
advice
if
you
want
a
decent
light
beer
spend
a
couple
extra
bucks
and
pick
up
some
sam
adams
light
o
overall
this
is
definitely
a
step
up
from
bud
light
in
the
flavor
department
but
lacks
in
the
drinkability
department
due
to
the
higher
abv
i
would
definitely
take
this
over
a
bud
light
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
especially
if
there
is
a
better
craft
option
available
let
me
start
by
saying
i
sampled
one
of
these
after
trying
a
southern
tier
choklat
this
high
abv
bud
is
very
similar
to
bud
light
but
you
get
more
alcohol
and
well
disguised
to
boot
i
really
dont
taste
anything
bad
different
etc
from
any
other
bmc
light
products
if
you
want
the
mediocre
flavors
of
a
bmc
but
dont
want
to
down
a
6
pack
before
you
get
a
buzz
then
this
is
your
beer
nothing
goodnothing
bad
enjoy
still
not
a
beer
ill
be
drinking
again
way
too
much
alcohol
and
too
little
flavor
youre
better
off
with
some
malt
liquor
overall
its
better
than
bud
light
and
the
flavor
really
isnt
all
that
bad
for
what
this
is
i
dont
get
the
cornadjunct
flavors
in
this
at
all
its
actually
quite
light
and
crisp
and
the
flavors
are
definitely
pear
and
apple
but
again
they
are
very
light
ultra
drinkable
almost
goes
down
like
water
if
you
want
a
cheap
local
buzz
that
has
very
light
crisp
apple
n
biscuits
flavor
then
try
this
i
only
paid
5
99
for
the
sixer
but
nonetheless
i
still
felt
overcharged
this
beer
is
only
good
for
people
who
want
to
catch
a
quick
buzz
and
not
really
savor
a
good
brew
12oz
blue
bottle
pours
extra
pale
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
in
a
minute
or
so
its
paler
than
i
expected
but
the
clarity
is
stunning
aromas
are
weak
with
some
corn
grain
tastes
are
weak
and
watery
not
much
more
in
flavor
compared
to
its
original
bud
light
mild
grain
cereal
and
a
sugary
sweetness
are
about
it
here
its
sweeter
than
bud
light
and
the
extra
alcohol
leaves
a
slight
prickle
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
highly
carbonated
it
does
go
down
smoothly
though
overall
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
more
here
with
the
sleek
packaging
and
extra
abv
even
though
expectations
were
set
low
to
begin
with
glad
a
friend
bought
this
for
me
not
worth
buying
yourself
id
love
to
say
that
it
tastes
nasty
offensive
or
terrible
but
the
truth
is
that
it
really
doesnt
have
a
taste
its
like
bubbly
water
with
some
corn
extract
flavor
ive
had
worse
tasting
beers
but
at
least
they
tasted
like
beer
this
is
nothing
not
worth
the
time
at
all
o
sucks
not
worth
the
money
sweet
water
me
and
my
friend
decided
ti
see
what
is
about
and
were
disappointed
time
for
something
good
the
body
as
expected
was
very
thin
and
watery
and
had
a
high
level
of
carbonation
the
beer
was
smoothly
drinkable
but
why
would
you
want
to
drink
several
of
these
overall
pretty
much
youd
expect
from
this
beer
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
this
beer
was
6
abv
however
i
suspect
that
inbev
hit
their
target
when
they
made
this
brew
but
theres
really
not
much
for
a
craft
beer
lover
to
like
about
this
offering
i
drank
it
so
you
dont
have
to
overall
if
offered
again
usually
when
the
good
stuff
is
gone
its
perfectly
drinkable
not
something
i
would
buy
even
if
it
was
cheap
as
hell
o
bought
a
sixer
for
6
99
to
give
it
a
try
wont
buy
it
again
it
is
too
bland
for
my
tastes
would
drink
bud
ice
over
this
the
blue
bottles
are
cool
though
the
look
smell
and
taste
are
to
be
expected
its
a
bud
light
with
slightly
more
malt
and
an
ever
so
slight
hop
characteristic
it
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
weekday
afternoon
ill
save
the
la
fin
du
monde
for
the
weekends
twist
off
bottle
and
into
a
coors
shaker
glass
i
like
a
little
rivalry
wow
does
this
stink
sweet
and
boozy
like
a
hurricane
who
pours
malt
liquor
unless
for
a
dead
homie
but
this
isnt
supposed
to
be
a
malt
liquor
right
tastes
very
sweet
and
corny
like
you
guessed
it
a
watered
down
hurricane
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
a
beer
for
people
that
dont
like
beer
and
want
to
get
tanked
quicker
if
youre
in
this
category
just
stick
with
the
jungle
juice
i
really
dont
understand
the
point
of
this
beer
if
someone
wants
a
heavier
bud
light
then
well
try
a
bud
d
there
isnt
much
flavor
to
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
not
filling
at
all
since
theres
not
much
substance
to
the
beer
mild
kick
im
not
really
picking
up
much
of
any
difference
between
this
and
the
regular
bud
light
smells
like
bud
light
spiked
with
a
nice
single
malt
scotch
taste
like
it
smells
cheap
and
tawdry
the
way
they
souped
it
up
during
the
superbowl
i
was
anticipating
a
serious
attempt
at
a
respectable
beer
could
have
been
brewed
in
a
prison
toilet
overall
this
is
disappointing
even
as
a
light
lager
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
there
was
a
great
deal
of
hype
building
up
to
this
product
being
released
but
for
me
i
wont
be
having
this
again
ab
offers
other
light
lagers
that
more
pleasing
than
this
one
if
youre
out
on
the
town
and
broing
it
up
then
i
guess
this
stuff
would
be
perfect
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
gets
you
drunk
faster
without
having
to
pee
as
much
as
you
would
if
you
were
drinking
regular
bud
light
with
enough
of
this
beer
youll
be
hitting
on
sorostitutes
in
no
time
at
all
oif
you
wanted
beer
with
flavor
you
shouldnt
even
consider
this
but
for
the
style
it
is
better
than
some
it
is
only
for
someone
looking
for
some
cheap
bmc
very
tough
to
rate
style
wise
i
would
say
3
across
the
board
average
run
of
the
mill
light
as
a
beer
probably
1s
across
the
board
so
i
tried
to
grade
a
little
more
towards
style
it
is
just
another
way
for
bmc
to
get
more
shelf
space
they
are
definitely
in
the
business
to
make
money
not
beer
d
no
i
dont
recommend
this
beer
its
a
novelty
act
for
a
company
trying
to
make
more
billions
it
wasnt
as
offensive
as
bud
light
lime
which
isnt
saying
much
but
this
was
just
not
good
o
this
was
just
a
bland
beer
overall
it
was
so
heavily
and
unnaturally
carbonated
that
it
gave
me
a
bit
of
a
stomach
ache
a
very
tough
beer
to
drink
luckily
my
kitchen
drain
gladly
accepted
the
final
6
oz
nice
try
ab
pours
a
clear
straw
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
slight
alcohol
hint
of
pale
malt
rice
and
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
light
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
citrus
hops
pale
malt
slight
alcohol
slight
metallic
and
rice
overall
weak
in
appearance
aroma
and
body
blend
and
feel
are
the
best
qualities
feels
thin
but
with
mild
alcohol
warmth
pretty
much
a
bl
on
roids
but
still
doesnt
give
off
the
overall
budweiser
feel
even
though
this
one
has
more
alcohol
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
transparent
third
to
fourth
piss
of
the
night
yellow
it
has
a
1
dish
soap
white
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
corn
sweet
just
like
original
bud
light
taste
hmmm
corn
sweet
bread
almost
like
those
hawaiian
dinner
rolls
adequate
carbonation
i
cant
really
say
that
i
prefer
platinum
over
any
of
their
other
products
a
little
more
alcohol
and
8
less
calories
i
guess
thats
what
makes
this
attractive
to
some
glad
i
got
it
in
a
mix
6
and
didnt
have
to
buy
6
of
these
but
i
hope
you
enjoyed
learning
about
platinum
thanks
wikipedia
its
basically
a
light
malt
liquor
lacking
any
real
malt
flavor
and
the
cloying
character
it
less
resembles
a
beer
and
more
of
a
very
watered
down
cheap
whiskey
there
are
clearly
better
light
beers
out
there
if
you
are
into
that
now
we
all
just
have
to
wait
for
the
half
dozen
fruit
varieties
that
will
follow
it
is
does
well
o
ok
i
guess
for
what
it
is
i
got
it
as
a
mystery
beer
at
a
bar
that
usually
has
good
mystery
beers
so
i
wasnt
happy
o
bud
light
platinum
more
alcohol
same
drinkability
i
can
see
what
ab
is
doing
here
i
cant
say
im
interested
in
ever
having
this
beer
again
but
honestly
once
the
aroma
disappears
1
which
doesnt
take
long
to
wait
for
and
2
how
many
people
will
drink
it
from
anything
but
the
bottle
this
beer
isnt
offensive
in
the
least
o
gonna
give
this
one
a
3
because
its
pretty
above
average
for
a
ab
aal
but
expensive
would
i
pay
a
premium
again
for
another
sixer
nah
its
only
good
for
the
style
and
im
not
into
that
style
anymore
so
its
not
for
me
i
can
drink
it
but
other
than
the
nostalgia
aspect
its
not
enjoyable
but
there
isnt
much
to
dislike
either
its
made
for
the
masses
so
theres
nothing
offensive
or
niche
about
it
its
just
a
slightly
beefed
up
middle
of
the
road
bud
light
beer
o
pure
curiosity
and
marketing
got
me
to
purchase
one
bottle
i
will
not
buy
again
o
a
great
beer
for
nonbeer
drinkers
nothing
in
this
beer
is
imposing
except
for
the
sweetness
not
a
quality
i
like
but
many
others
might
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
the
sweetness
overpowers
making
it
a
rough
session
beer
imo
if
there
was
a
category
for
chick
beers
this
one
would
top
the
list
12oz
bottle
a
friend
felt
compelled
to
buy
a
6
after
the
superbowl
and
gave
me
one
to
try
this
one
pours
a
very
pale
clear
yellow
color
there
was
a
good
deal
of
a
white
head
on
it
but
alas
it
did
not
linger
or
leave
any
lacing
light
aroma
a
bit
grainy
maybe
some
floral
but
nothing
else
taste
is
thin
and
watery
can
taste
a
touch
of
an
adjunct
corn
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
at
6
you
might
expect
some
flavor
but
then
it
wouldnt
be
a
light
beer
its
just
an
alcohol
delivery
device
with
a
big
ad
campaign
it
will
probably
get
some
mileage
in
the
cities
but
like
bl
wheat
it
will
likely
disappear
into
ab
history
o
a
bit
better
than
bl
and
the
boost
in
abv
makes
it
more
fun
this
is
pretty
much
like
bud
light
with
extra
abv
taste
is
much
sweeter
the
mouthfeel
is
less
carbonated
so
its
a
little
smoother
it
kind
of
smells
unpleasant
like
a
sulfur
scent
th
apperance
is
your
typical
aal
if
you
want
a
decent
beer
to
get
obliterated
on
this
is
it
typical
of
the
style
clear
and
lightly
tan
im
giving
it
a
staight
up
average
rating
i
was
expecting
crap
but
it
wasnt
that
bad
at
all
grainy
and
sweet
but
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
good
enough
for
my
expecting
terrible
better
than
typical
for
the
brewery
thats
for
sure
o
with
7
less
calories
than
a
budweiser
and
a
whole
more
in
abv
i
suppose
it
is
well
deserving
of
the
bud
light
title
still
its
just
a
boring
american
swill
lager
ill
get
drunk
tonight
either
way
boy
i
shouldnt
have
bought
a
12
pack
overall
this
is
a
light
beer
trying
to
be
a
malt
liquor
or
a
malt
liquor
trying
to
be
a
light
beer
identity
crisis
yes
ab
should
put
it
in
tall
cans
and
40s
and
call
it
a
day
overall
i
think
that
this
beer
will
work
out
well
personally
i
think
that
it
tastes
different
than
bud
ice
althought
similar
in
abv
i
think
i
like
it
because
to
me
bl
is
a
go
to
beer
for
chugging
and
now
that
its
lower
carbonation
it
will
make
that
easier
and
the
added
alcohol
is
a
bonus
for
the
purpose
this
beer
serves
for
me
i
suppose
its
a
wash
since
i
poured
out
a
little
of
my
blp
for
my
homies
who
are
no
longer
with
me
overall
not
worth
a
try
bud
light
with
more
alcohol
and
sweetness
ugh
o
i
enjoyed
it
and
ill
probably
buy
it
again
will
i
put
it
on
my
next
beer
list
nah
not
for
awhile
but
im
sure
someday
ill
want
something
light
and
refreshing
and
itll
be
this
been
waiting
with
baited
breath
for
this
randomness
to
come
out
call
it
a
tickers
curiosity
it
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
faint
with
undertones
of
corn
syrup
light
grass
light
sweet
flowers
and
mild
wheat
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
corn
syrup
sweetness
with
some
grains
hidden
behind
a
touch
of
sweetgrass
flares
up
as
well
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
syrupy
feel
overall
this
honestly
aint
as
bad
as
it
initially
sounded
frankly
id
take
this
over
a
normal
bud
light
any
day
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
likely
fresh
this
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
high
bubbling
carbonation
the
smell
is
as
expected
adjunct
sweet
malts
no
real
hop
presence
the
feel
is
light
taste
is
similar
to
regular
bud
nice
marketing
ploy
though
o
complete
fail
i
can
tolerate
bud
light
cant
tolerate
this
one
even
though
i
want

abv
surprisingly
im
not
too
terribly
off
put
with
this
beer
its
probably
because
there
actually
has
to
be
a
taste
present
in
order
to
critique
negativley
theres
just
no
there
there
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
almost
like
it
is
a
glass
of
tainted
water
a
slight
head
but
it
disappears
quickly
not
too
strong
of
a
scent
mostly
just
hints
of
cheap
earthy
grains
the
taste
isnt
too
bad
it
has
a
sweet
easy
drinkable
texture
only
a
slight
reminisce
of
beer
in
the
after
taste
definitely
would
take
this
over
a
bud
light
or
mgd
64
from
a
bottle
stamped
12015bk83
sampled
on
january
31
2012
the
pour
was
pale
yellow
with
a
short
lived
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
was
better
than
most
lights
with
a
decent
combination
of
grains
malts
sugars
and
a
clean
hop
note
the
body
fell
in
the
medium
range
but
also
had
a
smooth
creamy
character
the
taste
was
also
on
the
grainy
side
with
a
clean
hop
bite
and
something
almost
fruity
a
light
beer
with
6

is
better

it

as

diabetic
who
still

this
offers
a

alternative
to

options
it
is
very
crisp
with
some
more

than
most
low

beers
still
very
light
though
the
alcohol
content
is
surprising
as
it
doesnt

an

high

lager
it
is
light

from
my
unfortunately
now
rare

duvel
but
it
does

a

more
in
many
ways
to
those
of
us
who
must

reasons
considering
that
bud
light
is
the
1
selling
beer
my
guess
is
that
platinum
will
be
a
huge
marketing
success
for
abinbev
the
mouthfeel
feels
somewhat
lively
on
the
tongue
but
the
beer
is
slick
and
thin
on

below
average
but
not
a
disaster
overall
this
is
a
below

its

does
this

a

yellow
bright
golden
color
with
white
head
dwindling
quickly
aroma
has
some
green
apple
notes
with
a
faint
slightly
metallic
note
with
cooked
veggies
and
cereal
grains
this
is
like
putting
a
tuxedo
on
a
malt
liquor
flavor
has
the
sweetness
like
sweet
creamed
corn
notes
and
a
touch
of
rough
alcohol
herbal
hops
juicy
fruit
and
sweet
malts
defines
this
beer
pretty
much
sweet
even
cloyingly
so
brings
beer
to
a
new
level
of
mass
production
and
acceptable
sweetness
levels
overall
a
beer
i
will
drink
with
friends
who
buy
this
but
i
wont
be
spending
11
99
on
a
12
pack
again
although
my
wife
seems
to
enjoy
the
effects
of
a
beer
that
drinks
just
as
easy
as
bud
light
but
has
the
full
alcohol
level
of
6
abv
well
well
well
lets
see
here
pours
a
straw
golden
diet
gingerale
with
a
frothy
12
finger
foam
head
that
lays
atop
the
beer
nicely
for
most
of
the
time
grainy
smells
of
corn
and
grass
come
through
mixed
with
a
slight
rubbing
alcohol
touch
oddly
not
offensive
in
anyway
ah
the
taste
rubbing
alcohol
feel
without
the
burn
corn
old
stagnant
water
with
some
hand
sanitizer
dripped
into
it
weird
tasting
shit
mouthfeel
well
its
light
real
light
very
light
not
much
body
or
balance
to
this
what
so
ever
come
together
now
folks
now
i
dont
quite
understand
why
this
beer
exists
and
i
hope
soon
it
doesnt
but
it
does
and
right
now
im
drinking
it
it
has
no
smell
no
taste
and
no
feel
to
it
its
just
all
around
a
bud
light
with
some
hand
sanitizer
in
it
overy
average
better
than
bl
about
equal
with
bud
but
i
would
probably
pick
a
normal
bud
o
although
i
prefer
it
to
bud
light
but
i
will
wont
be
touching
this
beer
again
i
gave
it
a
shot
and
it
doesnt
compare
to
some
of
the
better
light
adjunct
lagers
out
there
o
really
awful
i
imagine
their
thought
process
being
oh
crap
you
can
almost
taste
the
alcohol
we
better
make
it
overpoweringly
sweet
to
hide
that
if
given
the
choice
between
this
and
bud
light
ill
take
the
bud
light
actually
i
cant
think
of
anything
i
would
choose
this
over
except
maybe
wild
blue
unless
youre
just
looking
to
get
drunk
with
a
few
less
bottles
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
one
o
overall
this
is
terrible
budweiser
is
a
thousand
times
better
and
bud
light
is
even
preferable
in
fact
id
take
a
bud
light
lime
over
this
garbage
the
beer
loses
that
crisp
clean
aroma
and
taste
that
cheap
adjunct
lagers
depend
on
which
makes
the
beers
immensely
less
refreshing
which
is
supposed
to
be
its
top
selling
point
much
better
than
bud
light
i
could
see
getting
this
from
time
to
time
instead
of
a
coors
light
or
similar
o
good
replacement
for
bud
light
at
a
party
at

alc
rjt
o
this
one
seems
more

less
than
the
regular
for
some
reason
this
is
too
easy
drinking
malt
liquor
has
an
extremely
offensive
taste
to
me
this
beer
has
a
mild
malt
liquor
taste
if
it
were
a
malt
liquor
it
would
be
the
best
ive
ever
had
ive
had
a
lot
worse
beers
but
this
is
still
bad
for
a
cheap
6
0
abv
beer
this
isnt
too
horrible
overall
not
my
favorite
but
it
is
definitely
something
i
can
see
myself
drinking
on
the
back
porch
with
a
few
friends
in
the
future
it
has
a
decent
flavor
and
packs
a
solid
punch
for
a
light
beer
drinkablity
for
me
is
zero
i
will
never
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
was
a
light
beer
aficionado
id
probably
be
all
over
blp
the
average
joey
suitcase
thinks
6
abv
is
robust
its
not
sally
overall
blp
is
a
novelty
and
two
years
from
now
this
beer
will
be
no
more
than
a
memory
a
la
anheuser
world
select
remember
that
dandy
blp
is
forgettable
and
while
not
terrible
it
is
um
what
was
i
talking
about
o
this
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
and
i
think
that
itll
pull
some
miller
light
coors
light
and
molson
xxx
drinkers
to
bud
overall
a
very
smooth
lager
that
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
would
never
seek
this
style
out
but
in
fairness
there
are
no
offensive
or
off
flavors
has
a
touch
going
on
more
than
most
light
beers
not
terrible
has
a
bit
of
an
odd
finish
they
really
succeeded
at
making
a
strong
beer
with
almost
no
beer
flavor
do
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
its
going
to
stick
around
long
i
can
hear
it
now
hey
look
a
new
bud
light
im
going
to
try
it
one
and
done
its
similar
enough
that
some
bud
drinkers
may
take
a
liking
to
it
but
not
enough
to
have
it
stay
around
more
than
a
year
or
two
this
is
a
party
beer
or
a
social
lubricant
when
you
want
to
get
drunk
or
someone
else
drunk
quickly
comes
in
a
blue
bottle
the
bottle
and
labeling
were
quite
nice
anyway
poured
to
about
a
one
inch
head
head
didnt
hang
around
very
long
not
much
lacing
if
any
very
white
in
color
brew
itself
was
a
very
light
pale
yellow
smelled
very
light
just
notes
of
sweetness
maybe
a
little
fruity
tasted
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
also
notes
of
fruit
maybe
apple
actually
tasted
good
this
brew
is
suppose
to
be
6
no
alcohol
could
be
detected
felt
good
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
about
right
ill
buy
a
sixer
when
this
brew
hits
the
stores
id
love
to
drink
a
sixer
to
see
if
its
actually
6
overall
this
is
slightly
better
than
bud
light
but
still
not
really
worth
drinking
not
pleasant
obviously
received
as
part
of
a
mystery
case
well
this
genny
from
the
block
is
certainly
a
whole
lot
lighter
than
jlo
it
is
what
it
is
my
dads
favorite
beverage
you
cant
teach
an
old
dog
new
tricks
i
wish
i
could
get
him
turned
on
to
a
session
ipa
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
water
added
to
the
batch
it
tastes
ok
at
the
brewery
dirt
cheap
but
i
would
look
elsewhere
not
even
worth
a
college
keg
party
pale
gold
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
a
quarter
inch
of
white
head
rests
on
top
and
gradually
diminishes
entirely
i
get
loads
of
corn
and
an
dialectal
note
that
is
off
putting
the
taste
is
corn
and
a
metallic
note
the
body
is
thin
and
watery
thats
1
29
that
i
want
refunded
o
ill
try
it
again
when
on
an
extreme
budget
its
between
a
dollar
and
1
25
for
a
24
oz
or
13
50
for
a
30
rack
partially
because
its
the
local
poison
for
me
definitely
will
take
this
over
a
regular
genny
too
it
has
less
of
that
flavor
usually
not
a
good
thing
but
you
see
what
i
mean
genny
light
brewed
by
genesee
brewing
co
in
new
york
state
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
this
brew
is
darker
than
your
average
american
light
lager
beer
this
brew
also
has
a
smell
of
grains
nothing
bad
about
the
smell
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
light
there
is
not
much
there
a
hint
of
sweet
and
water
and
that
is
about
it
for
this
brew
being
darker
than
other
light
beers
out
there
there
is
not
much
there
but
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
3
6
and
other
american
lagers
are
about
4
2
abv
im
not
impressed
by
this
beer
it
could
be
so
much
more
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
if
you
like
light
beer
then
you
may
like
this
brew
o
this
light
beer
has
more
flavor
than
most
macro
lagers
probably
one
of
the
more
flavorful
light
beers
out
there
overall
cheap
and
very
low
in
abv
i
only
bought
it
to
review
gotta
try
em
all
at
some
point
o
a
decent
light
beer
not
so
bad
with
lunch
extremely
sessionable
at
3
6
abv
but
definitely
not
a
goto
for
flavor
as
the
lousy
cans
of
cheap
beer
go
i
dont
hate
this
one
it
still
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
beer
like
it
might
contain
the
essential
elements
and
like
it
still
might
be
brewed
rather
than
mixed
or
synthesized
or
whatever
they
do
to
make
the
corn
water
these
days
sudsy
head
surprises
me
and
the
nonmetallic
flavor
profile
suggests
a
level
of
quality
a
step
or
two
above
the
others
real
thin
and
watery
feel
but
it
is
a
light
lager
after
all
yeast
helps
it
finish
clean
no
off
putting
flavors
sticking
around
easy
enough
drinking
if
you
can
handle
all
the
bubbles
but
if
its
cola
by
day
and
cheap
cans
by
night
this
is
your
horse
overall
tough
to
sit
down
and
rate
a
style
like
this
with
such
a
light
body
and
alcohol
content
the
flavors
are
subtle
notes
really
not
bad
easy
to
drink
low
abv
makes
this
a
lawnmowers
session
beer
o
ive
had
worse
so
i
may
even
cross
paths
with
this
again
what
the
heck
yay
local
o
overall
just
another
light
adjunct
oh
well
this
stuff
is
1
for
a
24oz
can
virtually
anywhere
you
go
so
you
get
what
you
pay
for
overall
while
certainly
not
the
most
flavorful
it
is
rather
refreshing
and
at
only
1
29
for
a
24
oz
can
it
makes
for
a
great
session
brew
rjt
overall
saw
this
at
the
store
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
it
goes
down
easy
but
is
not
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
pretty
much
your
average
light
lager
maybe
a
little
better
its
good
for
the
price
its
solid
although
super
low
in
abv
it
tastes
kinda
like
corn
and
cheap
grain
its
on
the
sweeter
side
extremly
drinkable
very
minimal
flavor
but
its
better
than
natty
milwaukees
level
i
prefer
highlife
for
budget
beer
but
its
better
than
wasting
money
on
bud
or
coors
honestly
for
the
price
point
i
was
expecting
something
much
worse
than
what
i
received
i
could
have
and
yes
i
have
done
much
worse
than
this
particular
brew
its
tolerable
it
could
even
work
as
a
lawnmower
beer
if
you
cared
very
little
about
flavor
yet
didnt
want
to
drink
straight
water
out
of
a
can
this
light
lager
was
an
urine
yellow
really
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
the
head
was
short
lived
but
it
did
show
some
retention
as
a
collar
that
left
scant
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
faint
blend
of
corn
and
rice
the
flavors
were
bad
i
tasted
an
unpleasant
mix
of
corn
rice
and
cardboard
slightly
sour
as
well
it
reminded
me
of
kix
cereal
only
stalerancid
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
the
body
light
and
the
carbonation
medium
garbage
meh
i
think
i
found
my
new
lawnmower
beer
overall
youre
not
going
to
be
blown
away
by
the
taste
of
this
beer
by
any
means
but
for
the
style
it
actually
isnt
half
bad
i
purchased
30
of
these
for
a
recent
camping
trip
and
they
worked
out
well
they
have
a
bit
of
a
sweet
malty
taste
that
kind
of
sets
it
apart
from
the
other
beers
in
its
category
id
buy
it
again
sampled
on
june
24
2011
it
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
corn
and
grain
with
a
dim
hop
backdrop
the
body
is
actually
pretty
good
for
a
light
lager
it
is
better
than
watered
down
the
taste
hjas
a
dash
of
malts
with
a
fresh
hop
bite
at
the
end
an
acceptable
macro
golden
and
sudsy
with
lots
of
carbonation
has
an
initial
aroma
of
dank
skunkiness
that
goes
away
after
the
beer
has
breathed
for
a
minute
dry
grain
aroma
with
some
sugary
undertones
tastes
of
dry
vegetables
and
grain
has
pretty
decent
flavor
and
a
lot
of
body
for
a
light
beer
dyeah
this
is
drinkable
the
fact
that
it
is
about
5
less
alcohol
than
other
light
beers
is
a
setback
because
if
you
are
trying
to
get
hammered
its
a
few
extra
beers
to
drink
but
the
taste
is
better
than
expected
overall
for
the
cheapest
30
rack
at
my
colleges
local
liquor
store
i
cannot
complain
notes
while
i
find
genny
light
to
be
a
quality
light
beer
im
still
not
a
fan
of
the
style
a
onceinthewhile
for
me
at
best
if
anything
its
much
better
than
the
big
3
bud
light
miller
lite
coors
light
d
ok
actually
id
take
this
over
any
of
the
bargain
lights
like
keystone
or
busch
drank
it
from
the
can
and
its
not
half
bad
very
light
bodied
beer
not
a
ton
of
taste
or
flavor
but
what
was
there
wasnt
too
bad
went
down
smooth
easy
to
drink
not
a
great
beer
but
for
the
price
it
will
get
the
job
done
if
youre
going
for
quantity
pours
a
thin
looking
straw
yellow
color
with
a
huge
billowing
white
head
and
no
lacing
at
all
smells
of
corn
and
sweet
malts
tastes
of
tons
of
grain
and
corn
character
and
some
malts

thin

fizzy
and
drinkability
is
very
low

again
this
is

this
beer
gets
a
terrible
rap
for
being
brewed
with
water
from
the
genesee
river
but
most
of
the
water
we
drink
in
that
area
comes
from
it
and
its
some
of
the
best
tasting
water
in
the
state
genny
also
brews
sam
adams
mikes
hard
lemonade

blue

so
if
the
water
really
had
an
effect
on
the
flavor
would
these
companies
allow
their
product
to
be
produced
at
the
genny
brewing
facilities
i
think
not
so
to
rochester
and
all
people
with
access
to

beer
choose
genny
over
those
overpriced
foreign

this

always
to

this
beer
for
what
it
is
it
really
isnt
that
bad
i
was
expecting
something
uncommonly
nasty
but
it
is
bland
and
inoffensive
this
alone
puts
it
above
other
offflavored
light
beers
such
as
bud
light
i
drank
this
can
at
well
above
the
rocky
mountain
level
of
cold
that
it
is
intended
to
be
served
at
and
it
still
wasnt
a
chore
to
imbibe
just
try
that
with
most
light
beer
this
is
by
no
means
a
good
beer
but
it
isnt
actively
bad
just
very
light
and
its
extremely
neutral
flavor
is
actually
a
pretty
impressive
achievement
the
detroit
area
specialty
beer
store
i
go
to
always
has
beers
common
to
other
parts
of
the
country
but
rare
here
that
why
i
had
to
buy
a
30
pack
of
this
ive
never
had
it
before
so
i
pour
very
clear
hay
yellow
color
with
a
quicklydissolving
soap
bubble
head
now
it
looks
like
diluted
apple
juice
smells
earthy
and
cornlike
smells
like
just
about
every
other
macrobrewed
light
beer
ever
but
the
taste
is
a
little
different
surprising
tastes
like
cereal
cherrios
corn
flakes
king
vitamin
this
may
smell
like
every
other
light
beer
but
the
taste
is
pleasantly
surprising
slightly
sweet
grainy
and
grape
nuts
good
i
like
it
its
still
a
watery
beer
that
youd
drink
mass
quantities
of
around
a
campfire
with
your
jerkoff
friends
but
its
not
bad
all
beers
need
love
ill
cherish
the
time
that
i
have
with
the
other
29
genny
lights
had
this
beer
after
it
was
offered
to
me
by
a
friend
pours
golden
with
not
much
head
to
speak
of
smells
metallic
with
some
hints
of
malt
and
corn
taste
is
a
light
malt
with
adjunct
a
slight
metallic
hint
of
citrus
overall
its
just
a
macro
but
its
a
macro
thats
a
lot
less
offensive
than
anything
bmc
has
ever
put
out
not
to
mention
the
much
higher
priced
corona
beer
pong
approved
d
beats
the
pants
off
of
bud
light
and
coors
light
actually
cleaner
and
less
blatantly
adjuncty
than
regular
genesee
still
not
really
much
reason
to
seek
this
out
we
had
some
left
over
from
a
party
so
thats
why
im
drinking
it
right
now
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
really
low
retention
it
fell
like
wile
e
coyote
off
of
a
cliff
nose
had
the
same
sharpness
that
i
noted
in
the
leaded
version
this
being
unleaded
color
was
a
straw
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
really
thin
and
watery
with
a
better
cleaner
taste
than
leaded
maybe
producing
a
light
version
of
a
beer
can
be
a
good
thing
finish
was
likewise
less
sharp
and
more
pleasant
that
leaded
i
would
drink
this
over
leaded
but
i
would
still
like
to
grab
a
genny
cream
and
see
how
it
stands
up
avoid
on
tap
at
all
costs
just
lick

pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
small
thin
head
and
very
few
bubbles
has
a
very
weak
hoppy
aroma
the
initial
taste
is
one
of
hops
but
thats
about
it
very
thinbodied
mostly
water
easy
to
drink
because
of
that
fact
and
also
because
it
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
a
taste
not
too
good
but
not
a
horrible
light
beer
despite
some
of
the
outrageously
low
scores
posted
for
this
beer
and
in
the
spirit
of
the
judge
according
to
style
mentality
along
with
just
the
general
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
believe
this
beer
is
remarkably
average
even
good
considering
some
of
its
brothers
in
the
american
macro
lager
category
the
pale
watery
corny
presence
is
accompanied
by
some
real
flavor
flavor
that
is
noticeably
missing
from
some
of
the
other
super
cheap
beers
like
natty
light
etc
a
bit
sour
and
salty
really
light
mouthfeel
with
some
real
gasp
malt
flavor
i
dont
want
to
have
a
lot
of
these
and
its
not
craft
brewed
goodness
but
it
is
a
cheap
macro
with
some
substance
grain
and
water
a
bad
blast
of
sour
corn
that
thank
god
fades
fast
to
a
finish

blah
30

i
think
i
will
leave
this
one
for
the
kids
beer
pong
and
funnels
and
all
the
things
that
make
collage
fun
but
if
you
respect
your
taste
buds
you
will
run
as
far
away
from
this
one
as
you
can
and
i
dident
think
you
could
get
any
worse
than
budwiser
i
think
this
goes
down
as
the
worst
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
so
much
more
drinkable
than
other
low
budget
beers
like
milwaukees
best
busch
light
and
natural
light
that
its
not
even
really
funny
people
always
rave
about
this
beer
when
they
come
to
my
liquor
store
in
florida
you
have
genny
from
new
york
i
drank
this
all
the
time
so
i
said
why
not
i
have
only
been
disgusted
with
every
other
light
beer
why
shouldnt
this
be
an
exception
pours
a
cloudy
canary
yellow
color
tastes
of
watery
hops
and
some
cereal
grains
like
ground
up
cheerios
afte
theyve
been
sitting
in
milk
for
four
hours
cheap
as
dirt
though
so
i
didnt
mind
spending
the
75
cents
for
the
bottle
had
this
at
a
frat
party
they
hand
these
out
free
when
you
get
in
the
door
and
theres
a
reason
they
use
it
for
beirut
for
fratwater
its
actually
above
the
natty
lightbusch
light
but
at
the
same
time
if
you
get
your
own
definitely
reach
to
the
back
of
the
fridge
and
get
a
sam
adams
or
even
some
schlitz
considering
this
is
a
light
beer
it
is
satisfying
it
has
a
pleasing
sweetness
to
it
with
a
mild
floral
hop
aroma
highly
drinkable
too
a
great
bargain
at
about
6
50
a
12
pack
its
the
beer
that
your
dad
gave
you
when
you
were
10
years
old
youd
think
that
it
would
scare
you
away
from
beer
drinking
forever
in
the
ensuing
22
years
i
have
given
a
lot
of
other
beers
a
shot
but
now
im
back
to
this
although
it
is
not
as
gross
as
i
remembered
its
a
far
cry
from
the
ales
of
dogfish
or
the
lagers
of
germany
it
is
however
and
adjunct
laden
watery
mess
that
is
par
for
the
course
for
its
style
sweet
aromas
of
cereal
grains
raw
barley
and
metalic
hops
the
malt
profile
is
timid
to
the
taste
along
side
of
the
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
leaves
some
sulfer
compounds
burned
match
cooked
corn
and
a
tart
green
apple
flavor
on
the
mouth
quite
dry
and
bitey
to
the
feel
and
lingers
into
the
terse
finish
i
guess
its
fine
if
you
are
fishing
with
your
dad
in
1984
but
you
wont
find
it
in
my
cellar
this
beer
is
ok
getting
past
the
first
few
sips
may
be
a
struggle
but
after
that
you
can
get
into
it
a
pretty
bitter
beer
with
a
malty
taste
a
pale
amber
color
with
a
distinct
hoppy
smell
tastes
pretty
good
once
you
get
past
the
first
few
sips
kind
of
watery
but
still
a
fair
representative
of
a
decent
beer
fairly
drinkable
appearance
is
a
light
pale
golden
hue
with
a
large
bubbled
white
head
leaves
behind
thin
lacing
with
quickly
diminishing
foam
aroma
contains
sweet
corn
and
rice
character
with
a
slight
metallic
tone
and
no
real
hop
profile
taste
has
cereal
grains
corn
and
rice
it
forms
flavor
with
a
touch
of
creamy
sweetness
and
low
hop
bitterness
making
this
light
beer
from
upstate
ny
very
unoffensive
mouthfeel
has
evident
carbonation
with
light
body
not
as
watery
as
some
light
beers
out
there
drinkability
is
definitely
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
in
number
however
i
dont
think
i
would
reach
for
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
verdict
a
very
unpleasant
light
beer
when
there
are
much
better
even
cheapies
to
get
i
couldnt
buy
one
so
ill
have
to
finish
the
12
brew
poured
to
a
bight
clear
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
upper
section
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
grains
that
also
have
a
cerealcorn
quality
not
a
bad
smelling
brew
based
on
the
light
qualities
of
the
brew
the
taste
is
not
bad
probably
the
best
light
brew
i
have
especially
with
the
cost
factored
in
with
the
exception
of
sam
adams
light
the
crisp
taste
adequately
carbonation
and
toasted
flavors
make
it
quite
smooth
it
is
nothing
overly
exciting
but
for
me
it
is
a
ok
brew
when
you
are
trying
to
save
a
few
bucks
or
drink
with
friends
that
more
or
less
enjoy
macro
brews
hell
they
will
think
they
are
drinking
the
good
stuff
also
growing
up
in
ny
it
was
a
brew
that
has
a
lot
of
history
and
family
memories
i
described
this
beer
to
my
friend
as
the
beer
that
you
would
want
to
pick
if
you
were
ever
challenged
to
a
beerdrinking
contest
and
you
were
allowed
to
pick
your
own
beer
the
price
is
what
would
attract
people
to
this
beer
thats
what
attracted
me
however
there
are
other
cheap
beers
that
are
much
better
the
beer
had
a
suprisingly
nice
golden
yellow
color
in
the
glass
with
about
a
half
inch
of
head
that
disappeared
very
quickly
during
the
drink
it
left
very
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
a
killer
slightly
reminds
me
of
a
urinal
the
taste
while
crappy
when
comparing
to
a
non
light
beer
is
still
better
than
just
about
all
other
macro
lights
there
is
a
strong
corn
and
vegetable
taste
but
nothing
too
overpowering
it
starts
out
strong
then
leaves
a
subpar
grainy
aftertaste
on
the
pallette
the
mouthfeel
is
flat
but
predictable
as
there
are
virtually
no
bubbles
in
the
glass
after
the
first
minute
or
so
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
id
save
it
for
the
hot
summer
days
the
ballpark
and
the
cheap
30
pack
for
the
party
pours
the
standard
macro
lager
yellow
with
decent
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
is
mild
as
is
the
flavor
very
drinkable
if
unexciting
substitute
for
budmillercoors
type
beers
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
one
either
drinkability
this
beer
is
not
worth
purchasing
as
there
is
so
little
alcohol
that
all
you
can
taste
are
the
vegetable
flavors
this
one
falls
far
short
of
the
mark
when
it
comes
to
light
lagers
pours
out
to
nearly
the
color
of
clean
water
with
only
a
touch
of
yellow
small
head
dissipated
rather
quickly
minor
notes
of
lacing
aroma
is
not
impressive
by
any
means
some
adjunct
and
sweetness
is
noted
over
a
watery
character
that
remains
constant
flavor
is
mild
and
boring
weak
malts
and
adjunct
blend
with
water
and
low
level
hops
to
produce
nothing
short
of
bland
and
average
taste
mouthfeel
was
light
and
watery
typical
of
the
style
drinkability
is
fair
at
best
go
for
genesee
cream
ale
instead
drinkability
beer
pong
beer
only
the
dirt
from
the
floor
will
liven
it
up
allright
here
is
the
deal
light
ales
suck
we
all
know
this
and
at
the
moment
i
am
eating
some
cheese
and
crackers
the
light
ale
tastes
good
with
cheese
and
crackers
this
is
one
worth
trying
taste
it
on
its
own
not
that
bad
eh
yes
light
beer
sucks
but
i
think
this
is
the
least
of
the
suckiest
it
doesnt
taste
like
rotting
chemical
ass
the
abv
is
only
3
6
but
thats
fine
i
can
do
a
6
pack
of
the
16
ouncers
and
not
feel
much
doesnt
look
the
best
the
label
is
heinous
but
it
isnt
bad
and
it
is
local
overallsuperior
to
regular
genny
due
to
its
better
character
and
easier
drinking
but
the
bland
flavor
at
the
end
kept
it
from
being
rated
much
higher
the
fact
that
it
has
flavor
should
make
it
notable
since
many
light
beers
lack
it
even
if
it
is
bland
who
knows
maybe
someone
else
will
like
it
for
three
bucks
a
six
it
will
do
it
a
pinch
it
pours
a
pale
straw
gold
body
beneath
a
full
head
of
bright
white
foam
that
drops
shortly
to
a
wide
collar
and
thin
surface
covering
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
initially
not
too
many
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
to
the
surface
and
the
mouthfeel
backs
that
up
its
carbonation
is
fairly
restrained
for
the
style
and
its
more
soft
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
than
crisp
some
cornlike
sweetish
malt
dms
perhaps
greets
you
in
the
nose
and
carries
over
into
the
flavor
bitterness
is
kept
to
a
minimum
and
only
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
is
found
in
the
finish
a
dull
residual
maltiness
and
touch
of
bitterness
linger
in
the
mouth
and
throat
along
with
a
touch
of
soapiness
its
not
particularily
offputting
but
id
like
to
see
it
a
little
crisper
overall
a
fairly
dull
flavored
light
beer
that
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
bit
in
the
refreshing
department
as
light
beers
go
this
was
unoffensive
which
is
often
about
all
one
can
hope
for
pale
pale
straw
a
bit
of
corn
in
the
aroma
thin
perhaps
just
a
touch
dry
with
light
sweet
corn
adjunct
flavors
very
smooth
with
no
metallic
notes
borders
on
flavorless
but
what
flavor
one
can
find
is
acceptable
the
beer
pours
an
almost
clear
color
with
a
pale
gold
hue
it
has
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
for
these
macro
light
beers
it
has
a
very
light
malt
scent
with
the
appearance
of
adjuncts
it
is
a
bit
dry
and
musty
smelling
the
taste
is
not
that
bad
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
flavor
that
is
watered
down
and
surrounded
by
rice
and
corn
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
an
extremely
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
drinking
light
beer
there
is
nothing
special
about
it
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
refreshes
oh
yeah
for
those
who
care
its
low
on
carbs
just
remember
that
this
is
a
light
beer
not
supposed
to
be
in
your
face
if
i
have
a
choice
between
genny
light
and
the
other
lights
brewed
by
the
macros
ill
take
a
genny
light
hands
down
pours
a
clean
pale
golden
color
with
a
crisp
white
head
that
lingers
quite
nicely
not
a
lot
going
on
with
the
aroma
a
light
maltiness
as
with
the
flavor
carbonation
is
what
youd
expect
nothing
to
get
in
the
way
of
finishing
it
and
having
another
grab
your
fishing
pole
and
a
12
pack
on
a
nice
summers
day
and
enjoy
a
very
light
yellow
color
that
leads
to
a
foamy
head
the
smell
was
very
skunky
i
have
faith
in
the
pub
that
i
had
this
at
so
it
had
to
be
the
beer
not
the
lines
the
taste
was
very
watery
a
small
taste
of
hops
but
not
anything
to
brag
about
genny
keeps
up
with
the
light
beer
tradition
of
being
just
a
bad
beer
i
applaude
the
brewers
for
attempting
to
retain
some
of
the
original
beers
character
and
for
a
light
beer
i
guess
this
isnt
too
bad
i
place
it
on
the
same
level
as
their
original
genny
which
is
below
the
cream
ale
and
the
red
lager
at
96
calories
genny
light
is
right
up
there
with
miller
light
in
terms
of
lightness
what
genny
has
that
the
budmiller
coors
lights
dont
is
character
thats
like
saying
someone
really
has
personality
that
leaves
it
pretty
wide
open
to
interpretation
hence
the
mixed
reviews
on
this
forum
heres
my
take
upon
opening
the
twistoff
cap
the
loud
pfffst
foreshadowed
the
sudsy
gassy
pour
i
was
immediately
met
with
the
faint
smells
of
canadian
beer
skunk
i
know
rochester
is
in
new
york
but
theyre
neighbors
as
well
as
faint
grain
and
alcohol
aromas
skunky
rubbery
flavor
with
a
lot
of
water
theres
a
huge
hole
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
the
fizzy
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
offputtingmuch
like
michelob
ultra
yuck
finishes
with
grainy
sweetness
and
residual
skunk
funk
but
amazingly
it
is
still
better
than
most
cheap
american
lagers
though
12
oz
can
i
grew
up
on
genny
but
this
was
my
first
try
at
the
genny
light
pours
the
same
straw
yellow
with
a
moderate
head
that
recedes
rather
quickly
leaving
some
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
doesnt
differ
much
from
regular
genny
and
id
say
that
was
a
plus
it
still
has
that
genny
taste
that
im
familiar
with
but
just
a
little
more
watered
down
this
is
another
good
session
beer
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
there
is
a
place
for
this
brew
in
the
beer
world
not
in
my
fridge
just
yet
but
somewhere
cheap
genny
light
be
your
name
light
color
whispy
head
and
that
all
too
familiar
lack
of
taste
this
beer
is
slightly
better
than
most
lights
especially
if
your
drinking
on
the
cheap
crisp
and
grainy
with
a
cooked
corn
grit
flavour
cheap
6row
malt
flavour
perhaps
also

too
light
to
really
tell
semicrisp
and
very
light
bodied
bland
and
watered
down
but
that
is
what
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
as
i
said
with
the
can
review
dont
waste
your
money
on
expensive
light
beers
this
one
is
just
fine
to
keep
you
slim

yeah
right
light
yellow
golden
in
color
with
quickly
dissappearing
head
light
bodied
with
seltzer
like
quality
mildly
bitter
with
a
hint
of
cooked
cornrice
sweetness
very
unassuming
better
than
most
macro
light
beers
one
of
the
more
flavorful
light
beers
from
a
distance
looks
like
it
would
be
like
any
other
cheap
beer
simply
put
its
not
this
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
not
worth
buying
not
worth
drinking
it
looks
almost
clear
when
you
pour
it
and
it
is
extremely
watery
and
tasteless
my
go
to
light
beer
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
watery
beers
ive
ever
had
it
simply
has
no
flavor
its
certainly
a
stretch
to
call
this
beer
works
for
beer
pong
but
thats
about
it
no
words
to
describe
this
swill
good
to
shotgun
and
thats
about
it
it
smells
looks
like
tastes
and
feels
just
like
coors
light
but
at
half
the
cost
if
you
are
having
dozens
of
people
over
for
a
summer
party
why
not
if
anyone
at
the
party
complains
about
the
beer
let
them
know
there
is
more
room
in
the
ice
chest
and
point
them
towards
the
nearest
store
great
for
beer
pong
if
someone
slops
it
on
the
table
no
one
is
going
to
cry
if
the
morning
after
a
party
you
go
around
your
home
and
find
a
bunch
of
open
half
drank
cans
its
no
big
loss
flat
keystone
light
makes
great
snail
bait
in
the
garden
see
your
friends
are
getting
a
slight
buzz
and
youre
saving
your
tomatos
from
pests
another
plus
is
that
aluminum
cans
are
profitable
right
now
at
recycle
stations
in
most
states
and
my
dog
loves
beer
im
not
going
to
waste
quality
suds
on
the
mutt
but
keystone
light
drink
up
fido
another
watered
down
useless
beer
it
is
worse
than
keystone
ice
and
same
thing
unless
im
playing
beer
pong
im
not
drinking
it
tastes
exactly
like
seltzer
water
great
party
beer
got
me
through
college
very
smooth
great
for
all
occasions
in
monty
python
s
live
at
the
hollywood
bowl
theres
a
joke
about
bad
beer
being
like
sex
in
a
canoe
its
fuing
close
to
water
that
joke
came
to
mind
as
i
drank
this
there
is
a
mild
bubblegum
corn
and
hop
bitterness
as
it
finishes
with
a
touch
of
metal
but
over
all
its
just
water
it
drinks
amazingly
easy
with
little
carbonation
like
water
its
not
overly
offensive
so
i
dont
feel
i
can
score
it
lower
than
a
2
its
just
water
and
very
little
beer
not
bad
for
a
i
have
to
drive
somewhere
beer
you
can
have
a
few
of
these
and
be
more
sober
than
when
you
started
ps
daughter
worked
for
coors
market
development
about
20
years
ago
her
insider
info
helped
me
pay
off
her
college
education
v
really
good
value
stuff
runs
at
like
12
bucks
for
a
30
pack
i
would
rate
this
beer
a
negative
number
if
i
could
enough
said
for
when
you
absolutely
must
have
alcohol
but
have
very
little
money
i
ended
up
with
the
last
2
beers
in
my
30
pack
tasted
light
it
had
set
out
all
night
bought
from
the
convenience
store
tastes
just
like
coors
light
good
drinkability
thats
all
average
cheap
light
beer
easy
drinking
smooth
simple
light
beer
i
personally
like
keystone
light
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
rating
it
on
what
it
is
an
american
light
beer
its
one
of
the
best
you
can
get
seems
to
taste
better
when
sipped
from
their
camo
wrapped
cans
the
best
thing
about
this
awful
beer
is
its
advertising
keith
stone
is
a
riot
otherwise
forget
it
its
not
worth
drinking
got
a
dirty
thirty
camo
cans
for
deer
camp
after
a
couple
you
develop
a
nasty
taste
in
your
mouth
makes
a
mean
hangover
also
cheap
buzz
tastes
like
shit
kegs
at
college
i
probably
vomited
often
the
best
bad
beer
you
will
ever
drink
had
this
at
a
music
festival
because
i
ran
out
of
beer
one
of
my
friends
had
this
and
gave
it
to
me
i
didnt
even
taste
anything
i
have
tried
most
of
the
macros
it
gets
a
3
if
i
enjoy
it
enough
that
i
will
buy
it
again
and
if
it
isnt
something
i
would
buy
it
gets
a
two
this
is
kind
of
bad
overall
2
12
it
may
be
the
worst
beer
in
my
fridge
but
its
not
the
worst
beer
of
all
time
it
gets
a
pretty
bad
rep
but
it
has
a
few
redeeming
qualities
for
a
light
beer
it
drinks
smooth
its
not
tasty
but
ill
take
that
lack
of
taste
over
some
of
the
overhopped
ipa
crafts
ive
had
i
think
i
bought
this
12
pack
of
cans
for
around
8
if
i
remember
right
if
anything
the
price
is
right
so
youve
got
price
and
drinkability
as
the
positives
with
pretty
much
everything
else
weighing
it
down
if
keystone
light
is
for
you
rock
it
but
dont
stop
here
to
do
so
would
be
a
grave
injustice
the
perfect
chuggable
light
beer
this
has
got
to
be
the
smoothest
easiest
to
drink
beer
out
there
it
is
also
one
of
the
cheapest
it
is
not
harsh
in
anyway
at
all
it
is
the
easiest
of
easy
drinking
beers
keystone
light
is
the
quintessential
cheap
light
beer
if
you
want
a
cheap
easy
drinking
light
beer
then
this
is
the
ultimate
of
that
type
enjoy
this
beer
was
ok
for
a
cheap
beer
you
could
tell
that
it
was
a
cheap
beer
when
drinking
it
i
have
had
a
lot
worse
cheap
beers
so
compaired
to
some
that
i
have
had
this
one
was
ok
if
you
do
not
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
beer
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
theres
a
reason
only
college
kids
drink
this
stuff
odamn
good
serving
type
can
if
im
low
on
funds
and
just
want
something
light
keystone
light
is
my
personal
choice
for
under
20
here
in
northeast
ohio
i
really
dig
that
price
when
im
in
a
light
beer
mood
as
ive
said
in
my
budweiser
review
while
i
venture
out
into
more
exciting
territories
in
the
world
of
craft
brew
i
have
the
old
standby
this
just
so
happens
to
be
my
light
standby
keystone
light
is
a
brew
made
by
coors
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
cam
says
always
smooth
and
i
will
give
it
that
this
brew
is
smooth
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
in
my
opinion
this
brew
is
better
than
coors
light
this
beer
has
more
to
it
i
would
get
this
over
coors
light
any
day
ive
found
salvation
and
it
looks
like
a
chilled
keystone
light
o
its
not
bad
nothing
makes
it
stand
out
from
other
aals
i
prefer
others
more
then
this
one
though
the
taste
was
miserable
as
was
mouthfeel
i
likened
it
to
drinking
an
onion
and
that
may
be
generous
while
the
steel
reserve
i
drank
a
few
nights
ago
was
almost
undrinkable
keystone
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
displeasure
of
drinking
while
natty
light
is
not
a
good
beer
its
better
than
this
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
very
small
white
head
some
light
spotty
lacing
was
seen
but
not
a
lot
above
average
carbonation
as
would
be
expected
the
aroma
with
very
weak
and
is
just
some
grassy
grains
the
taste
is
about
the
same
and
pretty
watery
as
would
be
expected
for
this
one
has
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
it
wasnt
too
bad
for
a
cheaper
brew
smells
like
coors
drank
this
for
a
half
a
year
as
my
go
to
beer
if
you
buy
coors
light
over
this
you
are
an
idiot
and
wasting
your
money
its
nearly
exactly
the
same
its
not
like
busch
vs
bud
where
they
use
corn
vs
rice
this
is
identical
to
coors
light
that
being
said
its
not
remarkable
and
seems
like
it
takes
more
keystone
light
to
get
me
drunk
than
other
lights
at
the
same
abv
overall
nothing
really
good
about
it
even
for
a
light
beer
this
one
is
a
weak
overall
due
to
the
sour
and
rather
off
flavors
of
the
brew
overall
keystone
light
is
not
offensive
it
has
its
place
on
college
campus
and
with
someone
on
budget
keystone
light
worth
the
money
saved
on
not
buy
higher
e
quality
product
like
bud
light
coor
light
or
miller
lite
nope
the
quality
of
coors
light
bud
light
and
miller
lite
way
better
then
the
cost
saving
of
keystone
light
i
will
not
hate
on
keystone
light
it
goes
down
smooth
is
what
they
say
when
it
is
watered
down
this
is
a
typical
economybrand
aal
not
much
going
on
with
the
beer
inoffensive
in
the
taste
but
there
isnt
really
much
for
taste
to
begin
with
it
goes
down
smooth
though
and
is
cheap
to
be
honest
i
couldnt
tell
the
difference
between
this
and
regular
coors
light
since
this
is
cheaper
i
would
probably
go
with
this
if
your
buying
in
this
style
of
beer
though
to
be
honest
even
at
these
prices
its
not
really
worth
drinking
in
the
first
place
well
this
beer
is
cheap
for
cheap
beer
it
does
have
one
good
quality
it
is
pretty
smooth
the
marketing
boys
took
about
the
only
decent
quality
it
has
and
markets
the
crap
out
of
it
it
is
very
liught
yellow
and
very
fizzy
it
smells
skunky
and
is
pretty
smooth
going
down
honestly
i
prefer
the
closet
aged
over
the
cold
stocked
shelf
beer
any
day
o
while
the
appearance
is
spot
on
for
the
style
the
aroma
and
the
taste
border
on
the
slightly
offensive
this
is
not
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
slightly
over
carbonated
and
definitely
not
one
that
i
would
grab
again
or
have
another
during
a
session
i
actually
remember
this
being
slightly
better
from
my
college
days
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
and
i
likely
had
forgotten
some
of
the
badness
also
just
to
note
that
the
flavor
actual
gets
worse
as
it
warms
up
so
i
recommend
drinking
it
extremely
cold
and
quickly
overall
extremely
cheap
beer
and
the
quality
reflects
that
overall
quite
simply
a
beer
that
is
hard
to
pick
out
any
visible
taste
its
sweet
watery
and
metallic
i
would
recommend
pairing
keystone
light
with
a
large
pepperoni
and
cheese
pizza
a
hockey
game
three
to
four
friends
and
a
constantly
replenishing
bowl
of
pretzels
but
anyways
if
u
low
in
money
or
u
just
wanna
save
and
get
a
good
buss
this
is
more
than
enough
to
keep
u
leveled
this
is
cheap
for
a
reason
its
horrible
i
now
understand
why
they
say
keystone
is
as
smooth
as
keith
stone
yellow
alcohol
corn
water
thats
basically
it
i
still
drink
it
only
because
its
very
cheap
give
me
an
ipa
or
a
stout
any
day
over
this
though
nothing
too
special
here
just
a
good
beer
at
a
great
price
this
is
much
better
than
big
brother
coors
light
this
actually
has
some
flavor
great
for
a
hot
day
at
the
beach
or
river
good
for
bbqs
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
etc
as
light
beers
go
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
plus
keith
stone
is
just
cool
lol
final
grade
2
49
a
d
keystone
light
is
a
totally
forgettable
light
lager
that
i
doubt
ill
ever
pick
up
again
that
being
said
if
you
are
a
strict
light
beer
drinker
you
might
as
well
save
some
money
and
pick
this
up
instead
of
coors
or
bud
light
flavourless
swill
is
flavourless
swill
so
theres
no
reason
to
spend
any
more
than
necessary
why
keystone
light
and
busch
light
arent
massively
outselling
their
more
expensive
counterparts
will
always
leave
me
befuddled
ah
well
a
fool
and
his
money
and
all
that
unfortunately
im
the
fool
in
this
instance
if
you
are
a
in
collegebroke
or
both
keystone
light
is
a
very
good
choice
to
get
hammered
for
a
very
cheap
price
at
1
dollar
a
can
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
it
is
light
yellow
minimal
to
no
head
smells
like
any
other
macro
light
lager
it
tastes
like
coors
light
only
a
bit
stronger
with
more
hops
overall
a
cheap
beer
to
get
the
job
done
o
it
is
what
it
is
a
marketable
cheap
and
effective
college
beer
i
drink
this
occasionally
as
a
lawn
mower
beer
its
drinkability
is
what
makes
it
so
successful
not
something
to
seek
out
if
you
are
a
beer
snob
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
drink
go
for
it
overall
only
when
its
all
you
have
left
over
from
a
weekend
in
the
mountains
not
good
barely
drinkable
overall
not
a
very
appealing
drink
in
my
opinion
beer
flavored
water
i
kind
of
hated
this
beer
its
innocuous
enough
but
its
like
a
lot
of
america
lagers
especially
light
lagers
there
just
isnt
much
to
it
and
i
get
it
its
not
supposed
to
be
earthshattering
i
get
that
its
just
a
waterdowned
beverage
to
suck
down
on
a
hot
day
still
why
would
anyone
buy
this
if
other
choices
were
available
that
i
do
not
get
price
is
good
for
indulging
in
it
mostly
good
for
parties
or
a
good
lawnmower
beer
nothing
to
offensive
about
this
beer
poured
from
a
can
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
two
finger
head
decent
head
for
the
type
of
brew
but
the
appearance
is
nothing
special
smells
of
cooked
corn
and
various
other
vegetables
and
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
rice
average
for
the
type
of
beer
the
taste
completely
follows
the
smell
and
brings
nothing
new
to
the
table
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
above
average
for
an
aal
the
amount
of
carbonation
goes
very
nicely
with
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
more
comparable
to
an
mgd
or
something
of
the
like
tried
after
busch
light
at
an
anniversary
party
this
one
i
actually
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
light
yellow
fizzy
beer
with
bubbles
rising
steadily
smell
was
nigh
on
nothing
taste
was
of
light
club
soda
and
a
little
beerishness
mouthfell
also
falls
flat
not
recommended
ever
super
light
very
crisp
even
spritzy
almost
smooth
almost
i
have
to
say
as
a
university
of
colorado
student
i
must
admit
that
im
a
bit
biased
perhaps
appearance
dont
really
know
i
suppose
from
beer
pong
i
can
say
very
light
practically
no
head
near
water
at
the
same
time
incredibly
easy
to
drink
those
that
say
it
is
like
water
are
not
entirely
wrong
very
watery
but
at
the
same
time
very
cheap
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
some
beer
pong
go
for
it
even
in
this
modern
age
very
cheap
and
honestly
coors
light
is
probably
worse
so
go
for
it
overall
nice
light
lager
i
enjoyed
it
no
head
at
all
on
this
bad
boy
looks
like
water
mixed
with
0
01
parts
beer
and
has
constitency
of
water
drinks
worse
than
water
no
taste
at
all
no
malts
no
hops
no
nothing
well
maybe
some
corn
id
rather
have
a
vodka
and
milk
than
this
shit
notgood
easy
drinker
not
offensive
but
not
good
its
a
cheap
buzz
but
not
a
satisfying
beer
o
i
refuse
to
hate
on
this
beer
as
others
have
i
tried
my
best
like
a
highschool
teacher
grading
a
students
regents
but
i
cant
really
say
there
is
much
to
this
beer
besides
being
a
frat
house
beer
pong
swill
i
give
credit
to
keystone
for
brewing
such
a
marketable
high
selling
beer
you
must
see
that
the
reason
this
beer
sells
so
well
is
clearly
not
the
taste
aroma
look
or
mouthfeel
its
marketing
and
easy
drinking
you
can
give
this
beer
to
any
college
girl
in
america
and
shell
probably
drink
it
enough
said
marketing
campaign
finished
shameful
but
profitable
i
cant
respect
it
but
i
can
understand
it
o
again
much
like
the
other
macros
good
for
a
shotgun
party
beer
pong
frat
house
etc
the
commercials
are
still
humorous
not
much
of
an
appearance
with
about
a
1
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
like
watered
down
water
beer
taste
like
a
normal
american
pilsner
which
lacks
much
flavor
or
imagination
really
crisp
and
tastes
pretty
much
how
it
smells
and
looks
lets
face
it
this
is
a
drinking
game
beer
so
leave
it
for
the
tailgates
or
beer
pong
unless
of
course
its
free
then
the
free
beer
rule
applies
i
stay
as
far
away
from
this
as
possible
tastes
the
same
but
with
such
little
intensity
of
flavor
that
it
is
slammable
especially
considering
the
refreshing
pop
of
the
supercarbonation
the
bigger
the
gulp
the
more
enjoyable
this
theory
applies
all
the
way
to
the
12ozshotgun
level
no
small
sips
o
if
youre
in
the
need
of
a
beer
for
a
case
race
or
shotgunning
youve
found
what
youre
looking
for
but
other
than
that
meh
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
are
the
mildly
entreating
commercials
o
a
better
water
than
it
is
a
beer
there
are
so
many
better
light
lagers
out
there
and
this
is
just
over
all
a
bad
beer
this
beer
is
great
for
shotgunning
theres
nothing
too
this
one
at
all
i
cant
think
of
a
reason
for
anyone
too
try
this
beer
o
not
much
to
this
beer
better
than
some
macros
but
there
is
alot
better
out
there
no
real
reason
to
drink
this
unless
you
like
a
smooth
watery
taste
o
i
really
dont
mean
to
give
this
beer
a
clubbing
but
holy
hell
was
this
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
watery
taste
horrible
smell
and
little
carbonation
at
least
its
cheap
but
honestly
there
are
beers
10x
better
for
jut
50
cents
more
save
yourself
overall
definitely
drinkable
thats
what
its
for
beer
pong
enthusiasts
and
broke
undergrads
will
enjoy
this
is
as
a
refrigerator
staple
but
it
wont
impress
the
discerning
drinker
thee
are
worse
light
beers
out
there
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
this
is
an
unpleasant
brew
with
few
redeeming
characteristics
i
cant
complain
about
the
price
but
id
discourage
friends
from
picking
this
up
simply
put
this
beer
sucks
but
it
gets
the
job
done
but
not
really
this
beer
would
pour
out
of
the
tap
with
absolutely
no
head
people
may
ask
you
if
your
drinking
apple
juice
because
there
is
almost
no
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
very
clear
with
a
slight
yellow
tint
close
to
pee
colored
and
has
almost
no
smell
to
it
closer
to
the
smell
of
stale
beer
if
anything
this
is
an
extremely
light
beer
almost
tastes
like
somebody
put
water
in
it
in
fact
the
only
reason
you
could
have
your
brew
taste
like
that
is
if
you
did
add
water
to
it
overall
its
rather
nondescript
but
its
unoffensive
the
good
news
is
theres
no
metallic
off
flavors
that
are
so
prevalent
among
macros
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
ill
admit
its
smooth
but
it
tastes
abysmal
unfortunately
i
have
eight
more
of
these
to
drink
overall
the
really
offender
of
this
adjunct
light
is
the
smell
if
you
have
the
wits
about
you
to
hold
your
nose
while
taking
a
drink
consider
it
otherwise
it
is
a
typical
adjunct
light
beer
water
with
a
slight
beer
flavoring
it
has
no
head
and
no
lacing
and
only
a
slight
aroma
of
rice
its
a
beer
best
kept
for
college
students
who
do
not
have
to
money
to
buy
anything
else
it
has
no
characteristics
of
a
real
beer
im
using
it
to
cleanse
my
palate
in
between
reviews
of
more
worthy
beers
i
was
looking
forward
to
enjoying
a
nice
delicious
beer
but
unfortunately
this
was
the
only
beer
my
room
mate
had
after
taking
the
first
sip
i
could
already
tell
how
bad
it
was
throughout
the
entire
beer
it
tasted
like
an
ass
of
a
cheap
beer
example
budweiser
and
busch
i
recommend
staying
away
from
this
beer
at
all
cost
do
reviewed
to
style
here
it
is
review
400
if
youre
drinking
light
beer
it
isnt
for
the
taste
keystone
light
has
the
least
amount
of
taste
in
a
light
beer
therefore
keystone
light
is
the
best
light
beer
ive
said
this
over
and
over
defending
my
late
teenearly
twenties
goto
this
is
the
beer
that
tastes
most
like
water
great
for
drinking
all
day
preferably
in
the
summer
sun
overall
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
its
very
very
light
tasting
and
looking
i
guess
if
you
were
trying
to
drink
all
day
long
this
beer
would
work
nicely
its
very
watery
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
not
very
heavy
at
all
nor
does
it
have
a
good
taste
has
a
bad
after
taste
and
gives
me
headaches
the
next
day
im
convinced
that
for
the
low
end
light
beers
keystone
light
is
a
solid
choice
its
coors
lights
little
brother
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
it
really
has
nothing
to
offer
this
is
slightly
worse
than
coors
light
but
im
giving
it
the
same
overall
score
because
its
slightly
cheaper
if
youre
going
to
drink
bad
beer
why
you
might
as
well
punish
yourself
with
this
because
its
not
significantly
worse
than
coors
light
i
was
pretty
damn
stoked
when
my
local
publix
started
stocking
this
again
i
havent
had
it
since
high
school
errr
college
it
previously
smashed
most
aals
except
olympia
hamms
and
old
milwaukee
in
numerous
headtohead
challenges
conducted
in
my
apartment
so
i
wonder
if
it
can
hold
up
to
its
legacy
first
off
the
looks
the
can
is
blue
with
silver
and
white
accents
there
are
mountains
embedded
in
the
graphics
but
they
dont
turn
blue
so
i
cannot
tell
how
cold
the
beer
is
i
imagine
the
beer
inside
the
can
is
very
pale
yellow
and
fizzy
with
a
sodalike
head
of
course
i
would
not
actually
pour
one
of
these
bad
boys
into
a
glass
that
would
feel
like
sacrilege
sniffing
around
the
can
i
dont
smell
much
except
a
faint
floral
jasmine
rice
note
the
flavor
is
quite
light
offering
little
more
than
a
generally
beery
grain
impression
light
minerals
and
a
hint
of
the
aformentioned
floralrice
note
alcohol
and
bitterness
are
not
perceived
crispness
is
the
feel
is
light
refreshing
and
has
a
sparkling
mineral
water
sensibility
about
it
i
still
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
the
best
aal
ive
had
in
a
while
probably
since
blatz
this
stuff
is
crap
no
flavor
or
feel
whats
the
point
taste
is
really
watery
but
has
a
bit
of
corn
sweetness
and
is
very
smooth
body
is
very
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
drinks
very
easily
beer
pong
i
could
not
resist
i
typically
only
drink
good
or
at
least
mediocre
beer
for
beer
pong
but
i
made
the
exception
for
both
this
and
natural
light
i
will
admit
if
i
had
to
drink
one
of
the
two
i
would
drink
this
again
that
is
not
to
say
it
was
even
decent
it
was
simply
more
than
what
i
was
expecting
if
i
have
a
choice
however
i
will
never
touch
the
stuff
again
this
beer
has
a
sticky
sweet
corn
taste
that
is
very
unpleasant
the
medium
to
fast
carbonation
also
leaves
a
terrible
lingering
stickiness
on
the
pallate
this
stuff
makes
coors
light
taste
like
the
holy
grail
of
beers
enough
said
o
this
beer
is
pretty
much
just
water
that
happens
to
get
you
drunk
if
i
rated
drinkability
i
would
give
it
a
6
out
of
5
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
sweetness
and
almost
skunky
in
the
taste
sweet
malt
and
a
small
hop
but
overly
watery
a
small
carbonation
like
bite
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
standard
domestic
thin
watery
and
lack
of
flavor
i
wish
i
could
make
a
joke
about
keith
stone
but
i
cannot
the
watteriest
of
the
value
brands
when
times
are
hard
this
may
be
one
of
your
only
options
i
would
recommend
a
busch
or
natty
above
this
zero
head
forms
to
trap
zero
smell
and
taste
do
not
dirty
a
glass
and
just
drink
this
from
the
can
quickly
coors
lights
twin
its
all
in
the
packaging
right
the
color
is
yellow
and
clear
with
good
carbonation
that
results
in
a
white
foam
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
and
taste
are
primarily
grain
with
attempted
balnace
of
hops
etc
the
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
light
overall
this
one
drinks
like
a
nonalcohol
beer
with
its
sweetness
it
is
actually
somewhat
surprising
that
it
is
4
2
not
horrible
for
the
style
but
i
would
certainly
choose
lots
of
beers
over
this
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
gets
the
job
done
the
job
being
inebriation
o
it
is
what
it
is
gatorade
for
the
alcoholic
o
besides
a
complete
lack
of
aroma
yeah
its
ice
cold
we
did
it
a
favor
its
not
a
terrible
brew
itll
quench
a
big
thirst
but
its
certainly
a
recipe
for
a
big
hangover
overall
i
cant
think
of
a
more
boring
beer
than
this
one
at
least
the
bad
tasting
ones
try
to
achieve
something
more
than
just
water
i
completely
hate
this
lack
of
attempt
at
anything
except
for
being
smooth
which
means
like
water
i
guess
overall
drinkability
excellent
for
what
its
supposed
to
do
but
im
having
a
conflict
of
interest
simply
rating
it
in
style
it
would
get
all
5s
that
way
and
i
just
think
thats
shameful
ill
just
have
to
make
a
blend
of
the
beer
rating
and
the
style
rating
edit
a
d
is
still
better
than
an

i
promptly
reimbursed
my
roommate
the

cents
the

down
the
drain
you
deserve
better
than
to
expose
yourself
to
this
heap
of
rubbish
that

would
be
a
perfect
beer
for
this
occasion
but
nothing
i
will
be
picking
up
anytime
soon
dconmay

right
the
only
thing
i
can
say
that
is
ok
about
the
appearance
is
the
moderate
carbonation
sweet
malt
adjunct
on
the
smell
very
sour
but
thats
not
enough
to
save
this
beer

cheers
you
wont
lose
much
from
your
wallet
though
i
wouldnt
even
define
this
as
sessionable
id
call
it
a
marathon
beer
beer
pong
asshole
kings
whatever
drinking
game
you
choose
this
is
the
perfect
accompaniment
certainly
not
going
for
quality
here
though
i
do
feel
it
surpasses
most
macros
but
if
your
looking
for
quantity
for
the
duration
this
is
the
way
to
go
notes
pretty
much
what
you
expect
from
a
really
cheap
beer
like
drinking
water
with
a
hint
of
beer
wish
i
still
had
a
torpedo
ipa
left
poured
from
a
24
ounce
can
into
a
pint
glass
no
head
or
even
carbonation
to
speak
of
pale
clear
yellow
color
basically
flavorless
if
i
stretch
my
palate
i
can
detect
a
little
sweetness
from
corn
and
some
metalic
flavors
very
watery
in
the
mouth
another
mass
produced
beer
to
be
mass
consumed
d
non
drinkable
ill
deviate
from
this
rule
long
enough
to
say
that
this
is
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
it
is
light
yet
virtually
undrinkable
and
after
choking
one
down
i
actually
would
have
drank
a
bud
light
to
wash
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
if
i
urinated
into
an
empty
keystone
light
can
and
put
it
in
the
fridge
overnight
i
would
have
myself
a
far
more
drinkable
beverage
than
keystone
light
the
feel
is
all
water
and
you
cant
drink
a
lot
of
this
no
matter
what
notes
as
i
have
said
in
my
other
reviews
light
lagers
taste
so
similar
to
me
that
being
said
i
think
keystone
light
fills
coors
niche
as
a
more
bargain
brand
it
looks
considerably
more
pale
and
has
a
much
fizzier
head
than
budmillercoors
light
smell
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
the
same
however
it
tastes
slightly
more
watered
down
however
itll
have
a
special
place
in
my
drinking
heart
since
it
is
my
go
to
cheap
beer
i
will
refrain
from
giving
it
higher
scores
because
of
this
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
would
drink
my
stones
over
a
bud
light
well
its
drinkable
not
better
beer
but
you
can
actually
do
worse
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
maybe
some
corn
taste
is
lacking
basicallly
water
with
some
hints
of
beer
feels
like
water
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
good
in
the
same
manner
as
water
or
iced
tea
overall
there
is
not
much
to
recommend
about
this
one
this
beer
pours
an
uninspiring
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
disappears
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
crisp
malty
and
rather
weak
flavor
is
malty
and
insipid
hardly
there
at
all
the
texture
is
quite
thin
and
a
little
watery
it
is
hardly
like
drinking
beer
at
all
drinkability
good
if
youre
just
looking
for
a
way
to
get
wasted
on
the
cheap
horrific
if
you
in
any
way
care
about
whats
passing
through
your
mouth
d
the
mouthfeel
along
with
a
very
cold
temperature
is
what
makes
this
beer
somewhat
palatable
got
this
one
from
a
friend
of
mine
with
friends
like
this
never
mind
clear
gold
color
with
a
thin
head
which
disappears
quickly
the
smell
ugh
some
grain
and
not
much
else
taste
is
mostly
water
slightly
bitter
water
at
that
with
no
real
malt
sweetness
could
this
cause
the
dreaded
bitter
beer
face
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
with
fair
carbonation
as
far
drinkability
goes
ill
get
my
friend
for
this
one
next
time
i
will
pass
even
if
it
is
free
like
this
one
was
this
stuff
is
drunk
by
horny
college
underclassmen
like
piss
water
save
up
and
buy
something
with
some
flavour
and
a
bit
of
class
ive
been
seeing
billboards
for
this
stuff
all
over
town
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
to
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
cant
say
much
in
favor
of
my
experience
other
than
it
was
indeed
pretty
light
which
i
guess
was
their
goal
no
smell
taste
or
mouthfeel
to
speak
of
all
very
bland
and
generic
drinkability
was
ok
because
i
might
as
well
have
been
drinking
water
it
really
isnt
all
that
drinkable
i
would
rather
have
a
glass
of
water
i
did
actually
drink
a
second
one
straight
out
of
the
can
and
it
was
more
drinkable
that
way
i
think
that
the
smell
of
this
one
just
really
turns
me
off
this
beer
really
would
only
be
good
for
filling
a
beer
bong
at
a
college
party
i
boiled
off
the
water
while
steaming
corn
on
the
cob
recently
and
the
syrup
that
cooked
onto
the
bottom
of
the
pan
smelled
very
similar
to
keystone
which
should
give
you
some
indication
of
what
it
is
really
made
up
of
d
its
like
drinking
mineral
water
goes
down
very
smooth
obviously
i
understand
what
makes
this
beer
appealing
to
college
students
but
id
rather
have
one
decent
craft
beer
over
an
entire
case
of
this
but
i
guess
thats
why
im
a
ba
to
say
it
safely
there
are
much
much
better
options
out
there
for
quality
but
then
again
you
get
what
you
pay
for
a
30pack
for
12
dollars
only
gets
you
so
much
and
doing
anything
with
this
beer
other
than
straight
pounding
it
is
to
do
yourself
an
incredible
diservice
to
your
beerloving
palate
at
a
college
party
this
stuff
is
unavoidable
but
serves
its
purpose
as
a
highly
poundable
flavorless
piss
from
a
24oz
can
appearance
is
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
crisp
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
has
a
light
corn
adjunct
aroma
taste
has
not
much
to
speak
of
very
light
grain
and
hops
with
a
slight
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
if
your
looking
for
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
and
no
more
it
would
be
a
good
one
its
watered
down
but
clean
lifeless
pale
weak
and
watery
the
can
lent
an
unappealing
chemical
taste
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
exceptionally
thin
i
cant
think
of
anything
appealing
about
this
beer
i
dont
want
to
sound
too
overly
snobbish
here
but
the
light
beers
that
come
out
of
coors
brewery
that
i
have
tasted
are
extremely
light
its
beer
for
those
who
just
dont
like
beer
id
say
and
who
dont
understand
that
beer
is
more
complex
well
should
be
more
complex
to
the
palate
than
wine
ive
droned
on
enough
summary
id
drink
it
again
ice
cold
at
a
party
or
cook
out
but
not
if
there
was
something
anything
else
available
i
dont
hate
this
beer
i
just
personally
prefer
a
much
more
robust
flavor
a
friend
had
this
ontap
in
his
kegerator
and
i
couldnt
resist
giving
this
a
try
i
was
also
out
of
kellerweise
last
time
i
drank
this
it
was
in
an
unfinished
basement
in
college
this
experience
frankly
and
thanks
to
kuklickx
wasnt
terribly
different
i
found
the
key
to
this
beer
was
to
taste
it
as
little
as
possible
letting
sit
on
my
tongue
for
a
split
second
before
gulping
left
just
a
cream
soda
and
white
bread
taste
when
i
let
it
linger
it
tasted
like
a
chemical
spill
it
was
sharp
and
acrid
with
a
dirty
water
background
stick
to
chugging
you
dont
want
to
taste
this
its
difficult
to
understand
how
anyone
could
view
this
as
beer
but
it
passes
government
regulations
for
the
definition
of
the
product
and
unlike
water
has
104
calories
5
0
grams
carbohydrates
and
0
7
grams
protein
not
to
mention
4
2
alcohol
by
volume
honestly
i
cant
even
really
call
this
drinkable
as
theres
nothing
there
to
make
one
want
to
drink
more
when
i
eat
something
delicious
i
want
more
when
i
drink
something
delicious
i
want
more
this
i
dont
even
notice
as
i
drink
it
so
theres
nothing
there
to
make
me
want
more
it
fails
even
in
the
light
lager
category
of
beer
absolutely
pathetic
tonic
water
with
hint
of
grain
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
anyone
maybe
if
i
were
into
beer
pong
but
im
not
and
even
then
there
are
better
cheap
light
lagers
out
there
if
keystone
premium
is
awful
then
how
can
anyone
expect
the
light
version
to
be
any
better
this
beer
is
watery
and
not
much
else
good
can
be
said
about
it
others
have
said
it
better
than
i
can
mouthfeel
is
weak
taste
is
atrocious
and
poured
appearance
is
without
obvious
merit
drinkability
you
got
to
be
kidding
yet
another
offering
to
the
masses
of
college
students
it
is
a
punishment
to
drink
this
stuff
if
there
is
no
party
around
you
obviously
this
beer
fulfills
its
role
perfectly
it
is
meant
to
be
cheap
and
get
you
drunk
it
does
that
taste
is
not
a
factor
for
those
who
just
want
to
get
drunk
on
the
cheap
pours
a
yellow
almost
clear
color
with
carbonation
very
clearly
shown
there
is
almost
no
head
at
all
the
smell
is
of
corn
and
that
smell
is
very
faint
at
best
the
taste
is
of
barely
corn
it
is
very
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
like
a
pepsi
it
is
very
fizzy
overall
you
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
it
is
filling
and
watery
tm
the
mouthfeel
is
for
the
most
part
watered
down
and
the
taste
has
some
weak
hops
in
the
background
really
it
tases
like
a
macro
light
no
more
or
no
less
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
dry
and
lightly
carbonated
the
body
of
the
beer
is
water
uh
i
mean
very
light
the
finish
what
finish
okay
my
opinion
now
it
is
bang
on
for
what
the
beer
is
suppose
to
be
i
think
that
this
beer
is
good
for
two
things
drinking
and
peeing
in
the
depressing
settings
where
one
finds
themself
left
with
choices
such
as
keystone
light
it
may
be
helpful
to
reflect
upon
the
path
that
has
led
to
such
dismal
circumstances
beers
such
as
this
fall
into
a
category
where
rating
them
is
sort
of
a
challenge
essentially
all
you
can
ask
is
well
what
did
you
expect
it
smells
like
foam
however
something
can
smell
like
foam
i
have
no
idea
but
the
only
thing
that
makes
sense
in
the
smell
is
generic
beer
foam
i
suppose
youre
really
just
smelling
adjucts
it
has
the
generic
adjuct
taste
of
corn
or
whatever
garbage
is
being
used
and
a
thin
watery
body
perhaps
you
could
say
there
is
a
slight
extra
sourbitter
taste
that
gives
it
a
modest
hue
of
unique
character
when
compared
to
the
other
light
adjuct
lagers
from
coors
et
al
again
the
best
thing
this
beer
could
be
used
for
is
a
catalyst
for
reflection
upon
ones
own
life
choices
because
if
you
are
drinking
this
by
choice
then
you
have
made
some
terrible
terrible
mistakes
although
this
beer
seemed
slightly
refreshing
and
had
a
manageable
taste
to
begin
with
as
it
warms
the
taste
grows
more
and
more
burdensome
i
think
ill
leave
this
one
to
hunting
trips
and
already
drunk
college
party
goers
d
very
drinkable
for
its
intended
massswill
purpose
in
a
halfdrunken
haze
i
bought
30
of
these
from
walmart
i
thought
it
was
a
good
deal
at
the
time
but
on
further
thought
i
dont
really
think
so
having
this
fine
fellow
out
of
a
beveled
beer
mug
it
pours
flat
its
pale
yellow
which
is
fine
by
me
but
the
zero
head
and
no
apparent
carbonation
makes
it
look
kinda
gross
it
smells
shockingly
sweet
corny
and
of
fusel
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
slick
and
cornygrainy
flavors
wash
over
the
tongue
theres
a
bit
of
an
after
taste
that
reminds
me
of
putting
a
penny
in
my
mouth
if
this
was
a
malt
liquor
id
be
a
big
fan
but
at
4
2
percent
abv
what
am
i
getting
thanks
a
bundle
coors
fuck
you
by
the
way
what
can
i
review
next
this
was
another
find
at
my
local
sixer
but
it
was
not
much
of
a
find
it
was
another
fizzy
yellow
beer
with
a
big
white
head
with
low
retention
the
nose
was
virtually
nonexistent
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
without
much
flavor
either
the
finish
made
me
wish
that
i
had
some
actual
beer
rather
than
the
swill
that
seems
to
fill
cans
boooring
final
thoughts
this
is
my
party
beer
for
as
cheap
as
it
is
a
very
draikable
good
beer
not
my
typical
style
but
inexpensive
and
easy
to
drink
not
to
mention
it
tastes
good
my
favorite
light
beer
just
had
this
beer
at
a
party
the
other
night
i
found
that
i
actually
couldnt
taste
it
opened
the
can
and
smelled
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
some
rice
poured
there
was
just
some
foam
that
settled
within
5
seconds
and
left
a
liquid
that
appeared
close
to
urine
in
appearance
the
can
actually
said
beer
on
it
and
im
glad
i
saw
that
because
honestly
without
it
i
wouldnt
have
known
what
can
you
say
really
you
basically
know
what
youre
getting
into
when
you
reach
for
one
of
these
which
is
a
night
of
getting
hammered
more
or
less
a
sorry
excuse
for
a
beer
but
must
admit
being
in
college
and
at
14
for
a
30
it
serves
its
purpose
nothing
to
enjoy
just
something
to
play
beirut
with
and
get
drunk
note
i
was
reminded
recently
how
important
it
is
to
review
a
beer
with
in
its
style
to
ensure
fair
and
proper
scoring
im
a
college
student
no
matter
how
bad
this
beer
adds
up
to
a
true
beer
it
is
a
great
deal
for
its
price
compared
to
other
cheap
light
beer
this
stuff
is
great
however
not
a
overall
good
beer
ice
cold
is
where
its
at
on
this
beer
then
its
like
drinking
a
bottle
of
water
after
just
walking
through
the
desert
i
must
admit
that
i
do
find
this
beer
to
be
refreshing
when
cold
it
does
have
a
clean
crisp
feel
with
a
nice
bite
that
i
attribute
to
heavy
carbonation
rather
then
hops
drink
this
beer
only
in
the
shop
while
looking
at
a
dismantled
vehicle
this
is
shop
beer
to
be
drank
quick
for
a
light
buzz
and
thats
all
its
no
surprise
that
all
the
categories
fall
subpar
but
this
beer
has
a
purpose
and
thats
to
get
you
piefaced
and
honestly
i
believe
its
a
better
and
cheaper
alternative
than
budlight
avoid
if
you
can
keystone
lite
is
really
just
a
beer
for
beer
pong
i
drink
them
every
so
often
just
because
i
typically
cant
afford
anything
nicer
and
its
not
like
it
hurts
to
drink
it
its
relatively
refreshing
lacks
most
flavor
and
has
a
nice
low
alcohol
content
to
it
pours
an
extremely
pale
body
with
strong
carbonation
small
head
and
no
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
and
tastes
very
weak
watery
with
low
malt
and
small
amount
of
hops
and
grain
strong
carbonation
but
not
horribly
strong
carbonation
overall
not
the
worst
but
not
good
or
even
okay
lets
face
it
the
only
reason
anyone
myself
included0
drinks
this
beer
is
to
get
sloppy
drunk
that
being
said
the
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
good
because
the
taste
is
not
necessarily
bad
but
because
the
taste
almost
doesnt
exist
the
beer
just
goes
down
nice
and
easy
with
no
flavor
at
all
the
other
aspects
are
completely
unremarkable
the
colorsmell
is
nonexistant
the
taste
is
bad
very
copper
tasting
the
mouthfeel
is
the
highlight
never
a
good
sign
for
a
beer
this
is
hands
down
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
ive
had
it
a
few
times
at
parties
and
could
barely
down
it
i
feel
like
this
makes
natty
light
look
like
jesus
the
color
is
poor
yellow
and
it
smells
like
corn
and
urine
it
takes
like
carbonation
it
has
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
is
just
so
bad
i
would
never
ever
spend
my
own
money
on
this
i
probably
wont
even
drink
this
if
its
offered
for
free
i
dont
like
bashing
beer
but
this
is
the
worst
ive
had
when
my
friends
throw
parties
this
is
the
kind
of
keg
they
get
its
cheap
and
for
good
reason
its
the
typical
bmc
light
lager
looks
like
tinted
water
smells
like
beer
mixed
with
water
tastes
like
waterdiluted
beer
its
overcarbonated
as
well
the
best
thing
about
it
is
its
not
hard
to
take
a
few
of
these
down
so
long
as
you
drink
it
quickly
its
a
great
beer
pong
beer
cheap
and
not
too
alcoholic
i
guess
its
time
to
give
an
officially
review
to
the
local
college
favorite
it
poured
a
yellowtinged
clear
color
with
a
singlefinger
head
that
didnt
last
long
and
a
ton
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
corn
adjunct
the
taste
is
watery
and
mercifully
unflavorful
all
there
is
is
a
bit
of
sweet
corniness
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
highly
carbonated
but
not
entirely
unpleasant
if
the
beer
is
cold
enough
thankfully
for
poor
college
kids
everywhere
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
you
may
find
yourself
drinking
half
a
case
of
this
without
noticing
well
beeradvocate
is
telling
me
i
need
to
type
more
but
there
isnt
much
more
to
say
about
this
beer
only
drink
it
if
1
you
are
dirt
poor
or
2
are
a
college
student
the
later
of
the
two
applies
to
myself
dont
be
temped
by
the

the

pours
a

color
with
a
12
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
below
average
it
has
a
faint
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
some
adjuncts
and
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
less
than

as
well
it
has
a
watery
pilsner

flavor
thats
devoid
of
any
real

character
it
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
finishes
dry
with

the

is

it
is
a
low

with

this
is
an

its

this

not

too
much
corn
sweetness
for
my
taste
just
not

d
the
horrible

made

i
couldnt

a
rarity
for
me
it
also
gave
me
a
bad

after
one
this
beer
sucks
and
i
dont
plan
on
ever
drinking
it
again
not
terrible
not
offensive
but
not
that
good
either
a
good
choice
for
those
who
like
easily
drinkable
beer
who
dont
want
to
drink
anything
complex
strong
or
overly
flavorful
or
are
entering
a
drinking
competition
best
served
cold
so
as
to
mask
its
lack
of
real
flavor
and
character
even
for
a
light
beer
you
can
certainly
do
better
d
it
is
super
easy
to
drink
this
beer
so
that
is
why
the
score
is
as
high
as
it
is
i
know
ill
have
this
again
as
i
am
still
in
college
but
as
soon
as
i
am
gone
so
will
this
beer
from
my
life
due
entirely
to
its
horrifying
head
keystone
light
comes
up
the
loser
in
the
sixteenth
version
of
this
venerated
series
dont
kid
yourself
though
neither
one
of
these
light
lagers
should
have
been
brewed
in
the
first
place
the
fact
that
its
a
2005
gabf
bronze
medalist
makes
me
wonder
if
there
were
only
three
entrants
that
year
better
than
average
drinkability
for
a
light
beer
and
not
a
regular
beer
of
the
american
light
beers
from
the
big
three
coors
light
is
the
one
that
i
have
always
found
most
tolerable
i
am
very
convinced
that
this
beer
is
nothing
but
coors
light
with
a
different
label
i
dont
mind
this
one
every
once
in
a
while
d
tastes
like
carbonated
water
but
if
i
really
just
wanted
to
get
drunk
especially
when
its
hot
outside
i
could
handle
this
i
dont
know
why
i
liked
this
so
much
in
school
oh
wait
i
know
it
was
cheap
d
dont
even
think
about
this
tasting
this
one
if
youll
be
drinking
it
fast
enough
to
not
taste
it
then
by
all
means
go
ahead
drinkability
suprisingly
drinkable
if
you
want
cheap
beer
you
can
literally
drink
this
beer
with
everything
as
there
is
not
a
single
flavor
that
could
possibly
interfere
the
light
lager
category
doesnt
do
much
for
me
at
least
theres
a
level
of
complexity
and
layers
of
character
to
european
lagers
and
pilsnerstyle
beer
dont
bother
with
this
one
unless
youve
got
thirty
friends
and
twelve
dollars
between
them
i
guess
this
might
make
a
good
palate
cleanser
between
beer
tastings
this
is
absolutely
the
blandest
beer
ive
ever
had
overall
cheap
beer
thats
better
than
busch
or
anything
else
in
its
price
range
but
it
still
sucks
if
youre
gonna
get
keystone
at
least
get
keystone
ice
to
get
that
extra
5
abv
drinkability
well
this
is
a
light
beer
nothing
terrible
tasting
but
lacking
any
flavor
at
all
if
thats
what
youre
going
for
i
suppose
its
good
mouthfeel
is
weird
and
foamy
the
only
redeeming
purpose
of
this
beer
is
the
fact
you
could
guzzel
can
after
can
otherwise
this
seems
like
a
close
to
exact
replication
of
coors
light
except
worst
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
a
keystone
brand
beer
since
i
can
remember
it
was
offered
by
a
friend
during
a
recent
visit
to
his
home
honestly
its
an
absolutely
tasteless
beer
theres
absolutely
no
smell
and
just
a
shadow
of
a
grass
taste
nothing
really
resembles
a
traditional
beer
flavor
theres
really
no
unpleasantness
its
just
a
completely
empty
and
hollow
beer
very
watery
body
with
a
normal
amount
of
carbonation
the
head
is
initially
fizzy
then
nonexistent
like
a
sodapop
this
just
isnt
for
me
it
crazy
when
i
can
buy
a
thirty
pack
of
these
stones
for
less
than
i
can
buy
a
thirty
pack
of
bottled
waters
although
bottled
water
is
pretty
close
to
what
this
beer
is
the
color
has
to
be
the
lightest
shade
of
yellow
possible
as
well
its
carbonated
yellow
water
that
someone
through
some
alcohol
into
because
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
someone
actually
brews
this
if
you
have
ever
wanted
to
get
drunk
whilst
drinking
water
here
is
your
chance
and
this
is
the
most
unbelievably
cheap
beer
in
history
i
think
it
might
be
cheaper
than
natty
which
i
didnt
know
was
possible
you
can
pick
up
a
nice
30
stones
for
a
cool
11
bucks
11
bucks
theyre
practically
giving
it
away
if
you
are
in
college
why
are
you
not
drinking
this
youll
never
go
broke
again
overall
this
is
a
cheap
beer
and
should
be
enjoyed
as
such
not
as
bad
as
other
cheapos
overall
the
thinnest
most
insubstantial
and
least
beerlike
beer
ive
ever
tasted
there
may
be
worse
out
there
but
nothing
more
absolutely
unbeerlike
absolutely
avoid
this
is
a
college
drinking
beer
for
sure
if
you
want
to
drink
a
ton
and
not
get
filled
up
or
get
sick
from
a
metal
like
taste
this
is
your
beer
there
is
hardly
anything
too
it
although
it
pretty
much
is
a
crap
beer
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
and
it
goes
down
smooth
and
since
there
isnt
any
aftertaste
you
can
drink
them
all
night
long
this
beer
is
terrible
no
need
to
go
into
specifics
i
dont
even
want
to
discuss
the
taste
and
appearance
and
etc
its
bad
the
cheapest
beer
ever
made
good
for
college
parties
i
guess
but
if
i
have
a
choice
in
what
i
am
drinking
i
would
never
choose
this
d
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
light
goes
down
easy
and
wont
normally
give
you
a
hangover
unless
you
really
deserve
one
if
you
are
looking
for
a
flavorful
beer
dont
look
here
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
very
watery
it
really
leaves
a
bad
aftertaste
too
not
really
drinkableat
all
just
a
mediocre
macro
beer
drinkability
ya
right
theres
no
way
this
one
is
going
into
my
dont
ever
drink
again
pile
d
horrible
theres
no
way
anyone
can
actually
enjoy
this
one
not
much
to
be
said
about
this
really
pretty
watery
and
tastes
awful
the
smell
should
pretty
much
discourage
anyone
from
drinking
this
the
only
upside
is
that
its
about
18
bucks
for
a
30
pack
this
beer
is
only
meant
for
college
specifically
beer
pong
and
other
drinking
games
overall
id
recommend
this
beer
over
coors
light
for
the
price
because
the
taste
is
just
about
the
same
and
stone
light
is
much
cheaper
the
only
other
time
id
recommend
it
is
when
quantity
drinking
or
maybe
to
someone
who
isnt
really
a
beer
fan
no
head
no
smell
little
taste
that
about
sums
it
up
its
good
for
those
college
parties
when
youve
just
finished
finals
on
friday
and
headed
home
on
sunday
evening
ive
had
worse
macros
and
key
isnt
offensive
its
just
not
good
no
bitterness
to
by
found
at
all
the
only
taste
is
a
unidentifiable
grain
im
guessing
a
mix
of
rice
and
corn
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
i
could
easily
finish
the
30
rack
on
a
saturday
afternoonevening
only
real
purpose
is
to
get
drunk
at
a
college
party
to
be
honest
thats
what
i
bought
this
one
for
rugby
championship
halloween
weekend
good
for
tailgaiting
beer
pong
and
such
which
still
admittedly
happens
from
when
i
first
had
it
to
now
id
say
the
first
beer
takes
like
water
with
a
dash
of
urine
the
good
thing
about
it
is
its
cheap
and
if
your
in
college
theres
a
great
chance
that
its
not
outofdate
beer
the
beer
is
thin
in
color
taste
head
all
of
the
above
it
is
like
yellow
water
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
it
there
is
no
class
in
drinking
this
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
of
classes
drinking
it
10
for
a
30rack
what
of
it
overall
for
the
price
its
not
terrible
compared
to
other
low
priced
lagers
but
i
see
no
reason
to
buy
this
beer
keystone
light
is
a
very
clear
light
straw
colored
beer
it
had
a
white
head
for
about
10
seconds
barely
and
aroma
at
all
the
taste
was
about
the
same
as
the
aroma
not
much
there
this
is
petty
much
just
a
can
of
water
with
a
little
color
and
offflavor
added
yum
rejected
coors
light
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
in
my
case
that
was
nothing
a
friend
offered
one
of
these
to
me
i
drank
it
because
honestly
there
was
nothing
else
available
its
a
pale
yellow
i
wouldnt
even
call
it
golden
tastes
a
bit
like
beer
flavored
water
you
know
like
those
fruit
flavored
waters
only
with
beer
instead
of
fruit
it
does
go
down
easy
though
especially
if
you
have
a
cold
or
something
and
can
no
longer
taste
cheers
so
put
it
in
perspective
its
not
like
this
beer
is
good
but
when
looking
at
the
cheap
end
of
the
isle
i
dont
really
look
at
anything
else
except
pbr
or
maybe
strohs
drinkability
might
not
be
a
bad
replacement
for
water
on
a
hot
day
hits
the
marks
of
the
admittedly
uninspiring
standards
for
american
light
lager
no
real
character
to
speak
of
relatively
low
price
yuck
why
am
i
drinking
this
oh
yeah
because
its
in
my
fridge
and
im
half
in
the
can
from
the
delicious
ubu
i
just
finished
and
dont
want
to
waste
any
good
beer
when
im
ready
to
go
to
sleep
as
it
is
what
can
i
say
about
keystone
light
maybe
if
we
added
an
assfeel
category
to
beer
reviews
it
would
be
a
more
accurate
review
lets
just
say
this
beer
sucks
on
the
way
down
and
on
the
way
out
pleas
note
this
is
left
over
from
a
camping
trip
and
did
not
end
up
in
my
fridge
willingly
keystone
light
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
sixteen
ounce
can
there
is
very
little
aroma
no
off
smells
but
not
much
of
anything
really
wow
this
tastes
bad
really
bad
worse
than
i
expected
i
was
just
thinking
it
would
be
typical
macro
swill
with
a
watered
down
flavor
this
is
just
plain
bad
avoid
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
this
beer
was
the
fact
that
it
has
absolutely
no
head
whatsoever
it
looks
like
yellow
water
and
tasts
similar
to
that
effect
however
i
rather
enjoy
this
beer
due
to
its
price
point
and
the
fact
that
contrary
to
popular
belief
it
has
just
as
much
alcohol
as
coorsbudmiller
light
so
thats
not
where
the
price
relief
comes
from
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
different
very
empty
feeling
not
much
to
discuss
there
the
smell
is
nonexistent
seriously
no
smell
taste
is
pretty
decent
for
something
of
this
price
and
i
can
imagine
stocking
my
fridge
with
it
for
a
good
cheap
want
a
beer
type
of
beer
but
my
heart
still
lies
with
nimbus
monkeyshine
but
this
beer
brings
me
back
to
that
first
year
of
college
mmmm
college
party
beer
if
too
much
water
is
added
while
making
the
silver
bullet
coors
must
put
that
swill
into
a
keystone
light
can
carbonated
water
at
best
i
gave
drinkability
a
2
0
only
because
i
have
had
worse
i
had
to
give
appearance
and
taste
a
1
0
because
the
b
a
site
doesnt
have
any
zeros
and
when
i
say
zero
i
mean
it
this
has
absolutely
no
color
or
smell
this
is
basically
a
mineral
water
thank
god
that
my
sampling
came
in
an
aluminum
can
the
can
added
some
flavor
no
hop
barley
or
malt
whatsoever
when
will
society
come
to
its
senses
and
stop
the
insanity
to
spend
even
one
penny
of
your
hard
earned
money
on
this
crap
which
in
turn
helps
finance
one
of
the
big
three
is
truly
senseless
this
is
basically
coors
light
but
a
little
bit
lighter
most
people
cant
tell
the
difference
if
you
try
to
get
them
to
differentiate
this
beer
is
water
i
think
people
only
drink
it
because
its
cheap
i
had
a
girl
try
my
miller
then
her
keystone
and
she
was
like
mine
tastes
all
diluted
if
you
are
playing
a
drinking
game
that
will
require
you
to
drink
a
crap
load
of
beer
then
keystone
would
be
a
good
pick
its
very
easy
to
chug
because
its
basically
just
water
this
beer
also
has
no
color
whatsoever
a
very
fainy
smell
as
well
dont
order
this
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
to
just
have
a
beer
with
a
meal
this
is
a
drinking
gamesave
money
on
beer
type
beer
if
you
are
looking
only
to
save
money
though
id
go
with
other
beers
there
are
even
cheaper
beers
that
taste
even
better
than
keystone
avoid
is
certainly
the
proper
rating
for
this
beer
cheap
beer
30
pack
cans
here
are
10
99
while
i
would
not
order
this
at
a
bar
with
dinner
it
is
good
to
drink
when
you
have
friend
over
playing
xbox
360
the
only
reason
to
buy
this
beer
is
if
you
are
a
poor
college
student
looking
to
imbibe
mass
quantities
of
beer
which
i
am
obviously
this
beer
warrants
no
comparisons
to
any
quality
craft
brew
its
probably
the
cheapest
beers
available
available
at
my
local
package
store
for
13
for
a
30
pack
youre
not
supposed
to
taste
this
beer
youre
supposed
to
drink
it
as
fast
as
you
can
avoid
tasting
it
at
all
costs
because
what
little
flavor
this
beer
posesses
is
not
a
very
agreeable
taste
if
youre
just
looking
to
get
drunk
and
are
on
a
budget
this
is
the
beer
for
you
on
a
side
note
this
is
the
only
beer
that
has
induced
me
to
vomit
damn
i
just
spilled
this
shit
beer
all
over
my
computer
ill
be
mad
if
this
crappy
beer
ruins
my
computer
now
if
it
were
arrogant
bastard
duvel
or
perhaps
a
good
scotch
ale
it
would
be
understandable
drinkability
avoid
at
all
costs
however
this
beer
is
usually
the
top
choice
at
parties
because
of
its
ultralow
price
o
when
i
was
younger
i
thought
that
this
it
was
not
to
bad
in
a
pinch
but
now
imho
its
best
to
leave
this
one
to
the
college
frats
and
softball
teams
to
cheap
to
pitch
in
for
coors
light
of
course
i
had
this
beer
in
a
can
and
when
its
ice
cold
its
actually
not
too
terrible
the
cold
overpowers
any
of
the
bad
taste
something
i
would
drink
fast
for
a
buzz
at
a
party
or
after
physical
activities
its
a
light
yellow
much
like
urine
which
one
could
argue
is
eerily
similar
to
its
taste
when
warm
its
nasty
and
anytime
you
drink
it
its
watered
down
like
crazy
what
smell
there
really
is
no
smell
except
out
of
a
keg
it
has
that
crayon
smell
to
it
and
just
cheap
beer
the
only
reason
it
has
a
2
drinkability
is
out
of
sheer
frequency
of
drinking
it
so
i
have
become
accustomed
to
it
now
i
mean
seriously
what
else
are
you
going
to
drink
at
a
college
party
cheap
beer
keystone
light
is
the
epitomy
notes
you
are
either
buying
this
because
it
is
on
sale
or
because
it
is
on
sale
there
is
no
way
any
self
respecting
lover
of
beer
should
be
buying
this
stuff
pours
a
pale
straw
with
a
large
white
fizzy
quickly
diminishing
head
the
smell
is
very
mild
hay
with
barely
any
detectable
hops
it
has
more
of
an
adjunct
taste
than
the
aroma
leads
you
to
believe
light
grain
and
cooked
corn
with
a
hint
of
fruit
on
the
finish
it
has
a
thin
sodalike
mouthfeel
first
let
me
say
that
this
is
not
a
good
beer
at
all
however
i
cant
blast
it
too
hard
because
compared
to
the
other
ultrawatereddown
domestic
cheapos
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
sure
it
lacks
character
but
at
least
what
is
there
isnt
completely
revolting
its
easy
to
drinking
and
thirst
quenching
a
good
beer
to
down
after
moving
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
could
probably
do
it
in
a
few
seconds
but
what
i
dont
understand
is
that
this
is
made
by
coors
and
is
marketed
as
a
bargain
beer
but
i
think
this
tastes
better
than
coors
light
drinkability
ive
had
two
of
these
suckers
tonight
easy
to
down
but
i
couldnt
drink
them
all
day
like
ive
seen
many
of
my
friends
do
poured
a
perfectly
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
adequate
white
puffy
head
that
quickly
fell
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
virtually
nonexistent
with
only
a
slight
swwetness
present
taste
is
also
very
light
and
would
be
difficult
to
distinguish
from
water
if
not
for
the
carbonation
finish
is
virtually
without
taste
spacer
beer
ha
can
provided
by
gabf
as
part
of
a
reward
for
all
my
volunteer
efforts
for
the
2005
show
pours
a
one
finger
fizzy
white
head
over
a
dull
and
very
pale
straw
liquid
think
of
it
as
a
yellow
ghost
of
a
beer
smells
very
very
mild
only
a
hint
of
malt
sweet
cardboard
corn
melon
maybe
a
hint
of
hop
floral
but
im
really
searching
tastes
mild
malt
sweet
thats
in
balance
with
acrid
tang
from
the
carbonation
some
cantelope
and
some
cardboard
a
bit
tinlike
perhaps
from
hops
perhaps
from
the
can
you
know
this
is
actually
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
no
not
challenging
nor
stellar
but
pleasing
in
its
simplicity
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
nearly
waterlike
beer
like
this
could
go
down

f
this
stuff
is
cheap
rightly
so
and
is
therefore
a
good
choice
if
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
fast
other
than
that
try
and
avoid
it
a
light
beer
with
taste
just
the
wrong
taste
in
my
humble
opinion
i
would
have
liked
to
have
had
a
sweet
barley
malt
instead
of
sweet
corn
but
i
guess
any
taste
in
a
light
beer
is
better
than
no
taste
at
all
this
is
my
fraternitys
beer
of
choice
that
should
tell
you
something
mainly
that
this
is
cheap
and
doesnt
taste
like
beer
beeradvocate
asks
that
when
you
slam
a
beer
you
must
mention
a
good
characteristic
so
here
it
is
this
is
the
best
beer
for
shotgunning
i
have
ever
found
since
its
closely
related
to
bad
tasting
water
it
just
slides
down
the
hatch
overall
my
gawd
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
guy
can
get
up
in
those
commercials
and
talk
about
beer
quality
even
in
spanish
im
sorry
busch
beer
is
like
warsteiner
compared
to
this
i
mean
force
carbonated
swill
it
has
alcohol
and
tastes
somewhat
like
beer
thats
all
im
gonna
say
pours
straw
gold
with
incredible
clarity
one
finger
head
fizzles
away
like
tonic
water
no
lacing
but
carbonation
is
highly
active
strong
esters
and
cereal
adjunct
in
the
nose
with
no
malt
or
hop
aromas
present
sweet
cereal
flavor
and
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
that
may
be
hops
finishes
semidry
with
a
foul
adjunct
and
ester
taste
clinging
to
the
tounge
light
bodied
and
crisp
this
would
be
refreshing
and
drinkable
if
not
for
the
harsh
taste
just
crap
but
at
least
it
goes
down
alright
if
you
can
stomach
the
taste
and
smell
its
cheap
for
a
reason
taste
watered
down
its
a
light
american
lager
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
mouthfeel
but
water
but
when
it
comes
down
to
it
like
a
good
number
of
the
other
reviewers
here
this
is
a
college
beer
something
a
number
of
people
started
drinking
because
they
either
knew
no
better
or
wanted
a
cheap
buzz
i
drank
it
for
both
reasons
in
school
but
this
isnt
something
i
buy
readily
now
unless
im
throwing
a
cheap
bash
for
a
bunch
of
people
who
are
content
with
bmc
because
theyll
drink
this
too
either
way
i
dont
necessarily
hold
it
against
this
beer
that
is
what
its
created
for
the
low
on
funds
adjunct
lager
lover
drinkable
given
the
situationthey
were
colder
than
cold
there
was
no
water
it
was
hot
and
humid
not
something
that
i
would
normally
go
back
to
if
you
hear
any
rumor
that
i
beerbonged
this
in
the
past
you
will
get
a
crisp
nocomment
not
as
bad
as
i
remember
it
and
likely
better
than
coors
light
id
rather
have
no
flavor
than
bad
flavor
this
might
be
your
beer
but
i
woudnt
recommend
it
so
if
there
was
nothing
else
it
wont
kill
you
otherwise
id
pass
this
is
the
beer
that
people
who
live
on
the
street
drink
come
on
youre
better
than
that
tastes
like
beer
from
a
bottle
because
of
the
specially
lined
can
and
who
could
forget
the
bitter
beer
face
comercials
i
could
be
wrong
but
isnt
bitterness
in
some
beers
a
good
thing
one
of
the
premier
beers
in
my
college
days
and
up
until
about
two
years
ago
you
could
regularly
find
30
stones
for
10
bones
here
in
lincoln
now
i
guess
they
think
theyre
more
premium
because
it
usually
goes
for
aroung
13
and
a
good
deal
is
when
someone
has
it
on
sale
for
12
i
can
remember
buying
a
30
or
two
on
friday
and
having
it
last
all
weekend
could
not
buy
beer
on
sundays
back
then
college
is
great
especialy
in
the
fall
sitting
around
all
day
saturday
drinking
watching
football
on
tv
playing
video
games
ordering
pizza
so
you
dont
have
to
get
cleaned
up
to
go
out
sobering
up
enough
sunday
afternoon
to
do
homework
while
watching
more
football
im
glad
i
took
7
years
to
graduate
i
was
surprised
that
no
aspect
of
this
beer
really
turned
me
away
but
theres
nothing
too
good
either
taste
is
like
water
goes
down
real
quick
hard
to
believe
you
could
get
drunk
off
this
stuff
harmless
drink
overall
cant
find
it
in
a
bottle
ive
only
found
it
in
a
can
not
even
on
tap
not
that
it
matters
because
no
real
drinker
would
ever
drink
this
often
only
for
the
poor
college
kid
like
myself
at
12
bucks
a
thirty
pack
it
does
the
job
but
there
are
far
better
beers
for
only
a
buck
more
drinkability
no
one
in
his
right
mind
should
buy
this
filth
there
are
better
beers
for
the
money
for
what
it
is
and
who
its
marketed
for
it
could
be
worse
for
me
id
rather
drink
ocean
water
at
least
ocean
waters
got
some
flavor
to
it
flavor
is
well
i
was
actually
expecting
something
maybe
a
ricey
flavor
or
perhaps
a
little
hops
there
honestly
is
no
flavor
whatsoever
it
tastes
exactly
like
seltzer
water
i
seriously
had
a
hard
time
drinking
this
because
of
the
serious
bitter
water
taste
without
any
pleasant
hop
bitterness
or
malt
i
dont
think
they
use
malt
in
this
beer
as
it
warms
up
you
get
a
hint
of
sugar
and
corn
which
was
actually
a
welcome
change
theres
actually
a
touch
of
green
apple
tartness
somewhere
beneath
the
huge
carbonation
i
think
thats
a
sign
of
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
in
quality
body
on
this
beer
was
if
i
may
guess
a
0
098
final
gravity
i
think
it
may
actually
be
lighter
than
water
carbonation
is
very
high
and
very
forced
i
think
id
prefer
this
flat
i
cant
believe
i
drank
this
crap
its
honestly
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
if
you
can
call
it
beer
not
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
again
as
usual
more
taste
than
bud
light
but
not
great
by
any
strech
not
good
but
there
is
worse
out
there
smells
and
looks
bad
tastes
ok
maybe
compareable
to
busch
try
to
avoid
this
if
better
beer
is
available
this
is
a
very
watered
down
tasting
beer
with
high
carbonation
the
alcohol
content
seems
low
as
i
seem
to
always
put
away
more
than
half
the
30
pack
with
somewhat
ease
i
mainly
purchased
this
due
to
the
price
9
95
for
a
30
pack
it
has
gone
up
since
a
few
dollars
which
keeps
me
away
there
really
isnt
much
difference
than
this
and
coors
i
had
a
few
skunked
keystone
lights
and
they
actually
had
some
characteristics
mixed
with
added
aluminum
flavor
if
you
drink
this
beer
enough
you
begin
to
pick
up
hints
of
banana
hiding
behind
all
the
carbonation
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
largs
amounts
of
when
you
are
in
college
priced
correctly
as
well
while
this
beer
is
rather
pedestrian
in
appearance
upon
scientific
inspection
it
was
concluded
that
it
in
fact
has
more
color
and
carbonation
than
coors
light
not
that
it
has
much
by
any
means
the
smell
is
kind
of
strange
with
a
hint
of
sharp
cheddar
cheese
and
bubble
gum
mixed
in
with
the
metallic
flavors
that
compliment
the
rice
and
malt
theres
no
flavor
to
it
but
granted
that
some
beers
actually
make
me
perform
what
professional
eaters
refer
to
as
the
reversal
of
fortune
its
better
than
some
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
water
and
lack
of
carbonation
no
hops
obviously
not
much
going
on
here

though

this

terrible
tastes
like
any
other
crap
light
beer
havent
had
one
in
years
not
missing
much
piss
absolute
piss
deserving
of
no
further
commentary
dont
let
it
get
warm
pretty
good
for
a
lite
beer
o
unpleasant
a
bit
nasty
not
so
bad
after
a
few
sips
i
would
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
if
i
was
thirsty
not
very
good
dont
suggest
it
good
beer
lighter
than
u
would
expect
shitty
only
drink
to
get
drunk
even
then
it
doesnt
do
the
job
ok
beer
but
nothing
to
write
about
this
is
obviously
not
a
great
beer
but
it
doesnt
taste
bad
and
it
has
good
mouthfeel
far
superior
to
bud
light
though
thats
not
saying
much
appearance
pale
straw
with
a
fizzy
white
foam
cap
smell
smells
like
nothing
corny
if
anything
with
a
little
green
apple
taste
crisp
with
apple
maybe
a
little
corn
no
hops
balanced
towards
the
malt
what
little
there
is
mouthfeel
thin
light
watery
high
carbonation
slight
carbonic
bight
stay
away
from
it
no
taste
or
feel
to
it
o
inoffensive
and
bland
advertise
anything
well
enough
and
sheeple
will
buy
it
none
of
that
pesky
flavor
to
get
in
the
way
of
drinkability
eh
lite
gold
with
white
top
whisper
of
biscuits
lemon
water
flavor
lite
mouthfeel
corporate
meh
but
better
than
most
lagers
ive
been
drinking
lately
in
ecuador
this
shit
is
absolutely
disgusting
coors
light
isnt
good
at
all
i
found
it
much
too
sweet
the
comercials
for
this
beer
are
perfect
there
is
no
mention
of
taste
or
flavor
yet
the
fact
that
it
is
cold
is
hyped
up
this
beer
looks
like
colored
seltzersmells
like
cornand
tastes
like
water
however
it
is
cold
not
much
other
than
a
water
taste
my
goto
cheap
beer
when
i
dont
have
too
much
to
spend
it
makes
me
happy
to
see
the
blue
mountains
overall
not
a
bad
beer
in
my
opinion
those
hot
summer
bbq
days
want
to
drink
beerflavored
sodawater
desire
urinating
twelve
times
before
you
get
a
buzz
this
is
the
beer
for
you
essentially
water
although
not
the
worst
tasting
beer
out
there
it
sucks
i
would
only
drink
this
beer
if
someone
else
bought
it
and
offered
it
to
me
river
beer
at
its
best
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
this
trash
isnt
worth
justifying
a
1
5
this
stuff
was
fantastic
when
i
was
in
high
school
beer
is
terrible
and
smells
like
wet
cardboard
best
of
the
domestic
competition
yep
light
for
sure
on
every
this
isnt
beer
foam
flavored
water
nice
and
crisp
beer
pong
beer
have
you
been
to
golden
st
louie
or
wherever
like
budweiser
but
worse
no
distinctive
taste
to
speak
of
absolutely
horrendous
looks
like
a
watered
down
mountain
dew
what
little
flavor
it
does
have
makes
you
wish
you
had
never
opened
the
bottle
21615
aluminum
bottle
hadnt
had
a
coors
light
in
a
while
wide
mouth
bottle
but
poured
into
a
glass
very
light
colouring
with
minimal
aroma
tasted
ok
and
it
went
down
smooth
and
easy
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
just
want
a
cold
drink
with
minimal
taste
and
calories
but
i
typically
seek
out
stronger
beers
with
varied
taste
better
then
water
worse
then
beer
its
coors
light
like
drinking
water
no
taste
after
drinking
this
youll
need
a
silver
bullet
this
beer
is
straight
garbage
its
coors
light
goes
down
easy
o
an
ok
beer
if
your
planning
on
drinking
several
in
one
setting
but
there
are
some
much
better
ones
out
there
for
that
application
super
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
taste
great
probably
the
better
out
of
the
cheap
light
beers
classic
volume
beer
not
much
else
if
your
judging
this
beer
against
the
light
lager
style
it
is
not
awful
it
is
the
classic
example
is
it
a
delicious
beer
no
that
this
inexpensive
light
beer
is
rated
awful
is
surprising
it
is
not
a
great
beer
its
a
light
crisp
clean
lager
and
it
tastes
good
this
is
a
pretty
good
everyday
drinker
more
suited
for
those
who
do
not
desire
a
full
bodied
beer
or
those
new
to
drinking
very
light
but
it
doesnt
taste
bad
another
super
light
refreshing
crisp
beer
thats
best
from
the
can
a
mood
enhancing
can
of
water
its
okay
as
far
as
commercial
light
beer
goes
very
smooth
on
draught
not
a
bad
beer
this
beer
is
for
beer
pong
better
than
miller
light
or
bud
light
but
not
much
else
joking
aside
it
isnt
terrible
on
super
hot
day
but
then
water
works
as
well
2nd
worst
in
a
blind
taste
test
of
7
aals
metallic
bad
aftertaste
best
on
draft
very
refreshing
for
a
light
beer
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
just
the
worst
lets
be
honest
it
was
good
for
beer
pong
in
college
but
serves
no
purpose
any
longer
meh
its
coors
what
do
you
expect
if
i
arched
my
own
urine
stream
into
my
mouth
it
would
be
more
pleasant
than
this
beer
that
is
all
barely
drinkable
and
stale
boring
beer
with
no
freshness
its
better
than
nothing
right
might
as
well
drink
water
tap
water
my
favourite
light
beer
for
bbq
and
summer
only
criticism
is
its
slightly
over
carbonated
overall
not
half
bad
for
a
microlager
well
honestly
watery
but
enough
to
taste
a
little
flavor
plain
beer
that
to
ne
is
very
blah
of
a
beer
tastes
like
fresh
spring
water
mixed
with
a
tiny
bit
of
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
anytime
you
need
to
tie
one
on
and
quench
your
thirst
such
as
after
hockey
or
while
installing
a
privacy
fence
coors
lite
tastes
great
on
lips
of
a
young
grad
student
at
karaoke
night
serve
at
your
next
couples
dinner
to
prove
the
point
that
your
not
interested
in
a
lot
of
discussion
just
gettin
smashed
overall
1
25
the
best
cheap
terrible
beer
on
first
sip
i
taste
the
pure
a
natural
taste
of
the
rockies
this
is
great
cold
refreshing
tastes
great
as
i
continue
to
drink
i
think
i
understated
my
first
statement
and
blasphemed
the
true
king
of
light
beers
seriously
though
its
a
good
light
beer
for
what
it
is
overall
im
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
this
and
i
cant
ever
see
buying
it
in
the
future
i
took
two
or
three
swallows
and
confined
the
rest
of
it
to
the
sink
i
really
wish
i
had
had
a
beer
with
my
lunch
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
thick
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
less
than
a
lace
slightl
less
corn
adjunct
aroma
than
most
and
i
sense
a
little
malt
surprised
on
the
flavor
way
more
than
most
adjunct
lagers
let
all
light
her
beers
sense
a
little
hops
also
by
far
the
best
light
beer
ive
had
i
think
some
of
the
reviewers
are
overreacting
about
it
tasting
bad
its
a
little
tasteless
and
watery
but
its
not
horrible
main
reason
i
dont
like
it
is
because
it
gives
me
horrible
heartburn
some
reason
maybe
the
high
carbonation
avoid
at
all
costs
its
basically
dirty
water
with
hfcs
added
i
would
tell
national
secrets
before
drinking
another
one
of
these
taste
like
watered
down
piss
but
if
thats
what
you
like
hey
thats
you
im
guessing
it
wasnt
fair
to
drink
this
after
a
trappist
rochefort
10
lol
hey
you
may
catch
a
buzz
if
you
drink
a
case
i
mean
its
coors
light
lol
i
will
never
drink
this
again
good
maybe
for
cooking
nothing
else
my
light
beer
of
choice
enough
said
ive
drank
so
much
of
this
rocky
mountain
kool
aid
and
ill
drink
a
whole
lot
more
good
stuff
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
unless
there
are
no
other
choices
its
a
light
beer
you
get
what
you
get
tastes
like
ice
water
with
just
the
faintest
hint
of
corn
smells
similar
looks
like
watered
down
piss
feel
water
again
overall
is
this
beer
or
water
cant
really
tell
probably
one
of
the
best
cheap
beers
that
come
in
a
36
pack
that
you
can
get
crisp
and
light
with
endless
gmos
that
you
would
expect
to
come
in
acheaply
mass
produced
american
lager
makes
me
wanna
watch
those
coors
light
and
ice
cube
commercials
over
and
over
again
this
beer
is
pretty
good
o
coors
light
is
great
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
a
light
practically
tasteless
lager
dont
fool
yourself
coors
light
isnt
trying
to
impress
anyone
its
an
easy
drinking
nonoffensive
beer
that
practically
anyone
can
enjoy
while
i
wouldnt
go
out
on
a
limb
to
buy
this
beer
for
myself
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
one
i
buy
it
from
time
to
time
simply
because
it
is
cheap
and
works
well
for
my
pretend
diet
as
it
is
a
light
beer
overall
as
light
as
they
come
but
absolutely
dreadful
do
yourself
a
favour
and
drink
vodka
with
some
water
because
that
would
taste
way
better
i
can
drink
right
from
the
can
now
theyre
vented
when
the
mountains
are
blue
its
time
to
party
thats
what
my
ass
says
to
the
toilet
before
the
beer
shit
explosion
speckles
my
porcelain
like
a
robins
egg
seriously
my
clorox
resigned
and
hit
the
road
when
it
saw
the
damage
thanks
coors
my
cleaning
products
would
rather
stand
shivering
in
the
cold
waiting
for
bread
rations
than
deal
with
the
plague
you
placed
upon
my
colon
overall
so
ive
finally
had
coors
i
heard
it
was
dreadful
and
have
to
admit
that
i
didnt
find
it
all
that
bad
the
problem
is
that
there
are
plenty
of
other
midstrength
lagers
for
an
equivalent
price
au40
per
case
of
24
x
355ml
that
are
of
far
better
quality
ill
just
take
a
carlton
mid
thanks
all
the
same
this
is
the
king
of
all
barley
pops
refreshing
rocky

mountain
taste
millercoors
super
light
mowing
the
lawn
type
beer
good
domestic
light
beer
also
the
aluminum
pints
are
sweet
awful
you
are
better
off
dropping
your
money
down
a
storm
drain
its
good
for
what
it
is
its
a
light
beer
water
nuff
said
the
beer
looks
like
water
with
a
tinge
of
yellow
there
is
a
faint
malt
aroma
and
malt
taste
with
some
corn
mixed
in
no
hop
presence
though
there
isnt
anything
offensive
here
there
is
virtually
no
taste
2550
the
beer
of
my
youth
metallica
drank
this
back
when
they
were
broke
teenagers
therefore
i
had
to
drink
it
too
its
terrible
beer
but
it
will
get
you
drunk
without
draining
your
wallet
a
lot
of
people
on
here
are
going
to
hate
on
this
beer
but
for
me
i
like
coors
light
for
what
it
is
it
does
not
try
to
be
different
or
interesting
in
anyway
but
if
im
going
to
drink
a
wheelbarrow
of
it
like
god
intended
its
the
best
for
that
in
my
opinion
so
on
to
its
taste
this
is
the
hardest
part
for
me
it
taste
like
water
with
beer
flavoring
kind
of
like
beef
flavored
ramen
tastes
nothing
like
beef
but
has
a
hind
of
beef
flavor
to
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
have
no
idea
why
i
like
or
keep
buying
maybe
its
the
marketing
maybe
its
the
fact
that
ive
drank
so
much
pabst
at
this
point
that
if
i
drink
anymore
ill
go
into
shock
and
start
foaming
from
the
mouth
but
most
of
all
its
the
best
of
the
worst
in
my
mind
bud
is
for
necks
and
southerners
and
miller
i
have
no
idea
who
drinks
that
shit
other
then
hipsters
but
for
the
rest
of
us
at
a
sporting
event
or
really
anywhere
that
you
need
to
drink
5
beers
in
45
mins
coors
is
the
beer
of
choice
here
to
coors
and
heres
to
merica
o
just
bad
avoid
it
if
you
can
best
worst
beer
out
there
drinkable
cheap
flavorless
beer
overall
2
29
i
do
keep
this
on
hand
in
my
fridge
from
time
to
time
awhile
back
i
logged
on
and
reviewed
keystone
light
on
its
own
merit
and
reflected
against
this
beer
because
rumor
has
it
its
the
same
recipe
from
the
same
brewer
but
a
little
more
stale
i
can
confirm
that
they
taste
similar
but
coors
light
has
a
bite
crispness
and
fresh
taste
that
keystone
lacks
i
think
its
the
difference
between
a
crisp
apple
and
one
left
out
for
a
day
keystone
compounds
that
lack
of
crispness
with
adding
extra
smoothness
so
its
in
fact
the
opposite
mouthfeel
of
coors
light
i
like
it
better
than
keystone
as
for
whether
its
worth
the
extra
price
well
i
dont
know
i
do
know
id
reach
for
this
over
keystone
light
in
an
ice
cooler
its
the
superior
product
better
than
bud
light
not
as
good
as
miller
lite
so
there
you
have
it
better
than
miller
light
thats
not
saying
much
i
enjoy
this
brew
its
the
only
thing
i
have
bought
with
my
own
money
as
far
as
alcohol
my
friend
introduced
me
to
the
silver
bullet
one
day
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
stronger
than
bud
light
at
this
point
i
was
kind
of
wanting
to
try
stronger
beers
so
it
was
a
refreshing
change
while
still
being
inoffensive
now
i
drank
it
today
after
having
some
the
other
day
it
has
no
flavor
to
speak
of
its
kind
of
sweet
though
its
nothing
really
memorable
poured
into
glass
gently
so
there
would
be
no
foam
the
foam
really
makes
me
sick
to
my
stomach
so
light
beer
is
really
good
because
of
that
pale
golden
liquid
never
actually
seen
it
out
of
the
bottle
till
today
its
smell
is
kind
of
sweet
its
inoffensive
i
cant
really
taste
anything
other
than
a
slight
beer
taste
very
forgettable
its
good
for
me
to
drink
when
i
get
thirsty
i
would
buy
it
again
best
beer
i
drink
all
the
time
probably
the
best
light
beer
out
there
in
comparison
to
stuff
that
i
recently
tried
being
corona
and
founders
and
things
of
that
sort
this
is
not
as
good
but
for
the
category
its
still
a
little
bit
worse
than
miller
lite
i
mean
coors
is
good
for
when
im
thirsty
i
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
overall
must
remember
to
respect
beer
at
this
moment
this
is
a
beer
that
would
appeal
to
people
on
a
diet
who
want
to
drink
beer
but
do
not
necessarily
like
beer
it
has
a
bland
weak
taste
that
is
in
no
way
appealing
to
me
at
all
if
you
are
fat
and
dont
really
like
beer
but
just
want
to
fit
in
then
this
is
your
beer
pours
a
pale
almost
clear
yellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
metallic
but
with
hints
of
fruit
and
even
a
little
hop
the
taste
had
a
lot
of
rice
in
it
and
then
a
touch
of
sweetness
on
the
end
very
faint
flavors
this
is
a
beer
that
like
mineral
water
quenches
the
thirst
without
taste
to
speak
of
there
are
no
flaws
to
the
brew
no
off
flavors
which
is
difficult
to
do
in
such
a
bland
beer
as
an
engineer
i
admire
this
but
as
a
beer
lover
i
disdain
this
approach
to
beer
i
am
sure
that
i
have
never
before
rated
a
flawless
beer
that
low
o
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
this
would
be
not
a
snob
its
just
with
so
many
other
options
out
there
it
is
amazing
to
me
why
people
actually
like
this
straw
yellow
almost
no
head
with
a
slight
astringent
finish
reminiscent
of
hops
nice
water
taste
it
is
a
great
breakfast
beer
or
a
beer
that
you
drink
for
the
sake
of
drinking
all
day
and
night
i
loved
this
beer
in
junior
high
but
now
only
meets
my
needs
when
shotgunning
coors
light
2
55
just
awful
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
yes
if
u
are
at
the
swimming
pool
and
u
need
a
refreshing
beer
give
a
try
to
the
coors
light
definitely
one
of
my
beer
that
i
drink
during
summer
nothing
wrong
with
anyone
who
enjoys
this
beer
theyll
just
be
very
hydrated
incredible
beer
love
to
drink
it
all
the
time
pours
a
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
very
little
spotty
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
just
of
some
grains
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
hint
of
sweet
corn
also
on
the
thin
side
lots
of
carbonation
nothing
real
special
here
but
a
decent
light
brew
for
the
warmer
months
overall
i
still
like
it
this
is
really
the
only
other
beer
i
like
besides
guinness
not
gonna
go
into
flavor
we
all
know
what
coors
is
like
i
drank
12
of
these
at
the
pay
lake
by
myself
without
getting
drunk
didnt
have
a
hangover
either
i
give
it
a
5
because
this
is
my
macro
beer
of
choice
that
being
said
there
is
little
else
to
recommend
it
i
dont
think
the
silver
bullet
is
brewed
for
making
memories
its
brewed
to
be
guzzled
and
coors
does
a
good
job
in
delivering
what
the
guzzlers
want
i
only
gave
it
a
1
25
because
i
felt
bad
giving
it
a
1
when
they
said
tap
the
rockies
i
didnt
think
they
meant
literally
put
a
tap
in
the
mountains
and
pull
all
the
animal
pee
and
poo
out
and
put
it
in
a
can
on
a
high
note
the
can
is
kinda
cool
with
the
mountains
that
turn
blue
although
you
would
have
to
be
of
low
intelligence
to
not
know
if
your
beer
was
cold
my
heart
doc
said
that
i
needed
to
drink
less
beer
so
coors
was
my
choice
i
figured
that
a
poor
tasting
beer
would
slow
me
down
and
maybe
enjoy
the
better
beers
a
lot
more
well
after
a
few
years
of
coors
light
it
has
slowed
me
down
i
quit
when
i
should
and
get
some
sleep
while
i
prefer
a
hefeweizen
for
quenching
my
thirst
the
coors
is
fine
for
the
times
when
the
lawn
must
be
mowed
and
it
is
hot
outside
in
that
regard
coors
light
is
ok
while
i
do
not
recommend
it
as
an
allamerican
beer
it
seems
to
taste
a
bit
better
than
any
other
light
beer
i
have
tried
will
seek
out
and
purchase
again
repeatedly
as
i
already
do
one
of
my
least
favorites
generic
cheap
beer
i
typically
avoid
it
unless
its
the
only
thing
at
a
party
even
then
ill
pick
heineken
over
this
save
your
money
and
get
a
case
of
yuengling
or
bass
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
okay
and
the
only
regular
macrobrew
or
light
beer
for
that
matter
i
will
drink
besides
budweiser
this
is
a
beer
for
sitting
outside
on
a
hot
day
drinking
and
talking
with
friends
or
a
light
drink
whenever
the
thirst
comes
for
it
this
is
a
beer
that
can
go
down
fast
and
drunkenness
would
come
fast
because
its
so
easy
to
drink
reminds
me
of
those
crystal
light
water
flavorings
but
in
beer
flavor
its
light
and
tastes
like
water
this
is
not
a
full
flavored
beer
to
sit
and
slowly
sip
just
a
simple
brew
with
little
flavor
i
think
it
is
okay
there
was
a
saying
i
once
heard
beer
and
girls
when
its
good
its
good
and
when
its
bad
well
its
still
ok
this
guy
must
not
have
drank
many
coors
lights
this
is
some
aweful
stuff
id
give
up
beer
if
this
was
all
there
was
it
tastes
like
pizza
cardboard
soaked
in
water
and
mixed
with
fruit
loops
with
a
lot
of
metallic
if
you
drink
3
quickly
then
it
doesnt
taste
as
bad
but
beware
it
cause
severe
belly
bloat
also
causes
insane
diarrhea
the
next
day
avoid
this
stuff
i
give
you
your
party
beer
it
comes
in
a
can
a
bottle
a
party
ball
and
a
keg
solid
for
beer
pong
and
beer
bongs
alike
ive
never
made
so
many
mistakes
for
under
the
cost
of
whopper
meal
which
appropriately
enough
will
be
some
undergrads
main
source
of
sustenance
at
300am
this
saturday
night
its
a
table
beer
not
the
kind
you
enjoy
for
the
taste
the
look
or
to
promote
your
local
rockies
its
sole
purpose
in
the
opinion
of
this
lowly
beer
enthusiast
is
to
get
you
where
you
need
to
be
am
i
right
fellas
more
so
its
your
gateway
brew
to
better
and
bolder
beers
coors
light
is
what
i
started
drinking
before
i
became
better
acquainted
with
the
wide
world
of
ales
and
lagers
i
like
so
many
other
rebellious
youth
was
introduced
to
this
great
and
diverse
realm
of
beer
by
the
welcoming
but
not
above
mediocre
drinkability
of
coors
light
and
for
that
we
thank
you
this
beer
is
a
heavy
beer
at
least
i
think
it
is
heavy
it
is
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
but
i
still
like
this
beer
it
has
a
strong
aroma
to
it
even
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
i
still
have
one
every
now
and
then
i
would
not
have
any
problem
recommending
it
to
friends
and
family
overall
i
think
coors
light
is
just
fantastic
it
is
a
beer
for
whenever
you
want
to
just
sit
around
with
friends
and
drink
a
ton
of
beer
wont
fill
you
up
wont
let
you
down
you
need
to
drink
about
25
to
get
truly
drink
but
its
enough
that
each
beer
will
keep
the
buzz
going
as
refreshing
as
they
come
cleaner
than
the
three
beers
i
have
mentioned
above
and
perhaps
second
to
sam
adams
light
for
this
style
so
far
for
me
there
actually
is
some
flavor
of
grain
and
yeast
without
much
of
that
light
lager
offflavor
o
sweet
cheap
beer
nothing
more
hi
i
am
from
colorado
and
i
love
this
beer
here
in
colorado
we
know
some
things
mountains
lead
west
coors
light
is
the
best
and
the
denver
broncos
are
going
to
win
the
super
bowl
every
year
i
know
i
have
a
picture
of
bert
farver
as
my
profile
and
it
is
true
i
want
them
to
bring
back
bert
just
so
i
can
watch
the
broncos
make
that
old
man
cry
over
and
over
again
overall
this
was
the
second
highest
rated
light
lager
rated
for
the
tournament
bracket
and
it
is
still
a
pisspoor
beer
a
sweet
watery
mess
that
will
get
you
drunk
if
you
have
enough
so
watery
this
light
beer
is
just
bad
flavor
not
much
to
say
here
take
a
coors
original
and
add
about
20
water
there
is
some
light
flavor
of
corn
husks
and
sweet
barley
malt
with
no
detectable
hops
mostly
it
tastes
like
a
malty
mineral
water
i
really
dont
like
drinking
light
beers
but
when
you
over
at
a
friends
and
thats
whats
offered
you
take
it
with
a
smile
nonetheless
i
really
dont
like
them
but
of
the
light
beers
ive
had
this
is
the
best
of
the
lot
and
another
thing
ive
learned
your
typical
big
american
brewery
or
for
that
matter
big
brewery
beer
just
doesnt
cut
it
for
me
any
more
the
craft
beers
i
focus
on
are
way
better
than
the
glut
of
stuff
you
find
in
walmart
anyway
coor
light
for
all
of
its
advertising
is
just
a
tiny
bit
better
than
ok
when
nothing
else
is
offered
not
sure
who
this
review
is
going
to
appeal
to
i
dont
know
many
beer
drinkers
that
havent
had
a
coors
light
at
some
point
in
their
life
extremely
generic
little
to
no
flavor
very
watery
foamy
when
poured
but
almost
scentless
airy
foam
serves
the
purpose
of
high
volume
drinking
useful
at
least
for
playing
games
or
long
days
involving
heavy
consumption
but
otherwise
purposeless
beer
no
idea
why
anyone
would
pay
for
this
for
any
reason
other
than
to
drink
without
feeling
too
full
very
boring
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
with
not
much
taste
and
no
originality
look
no
further
basic
beer
that
you
can
get
for
very
cheap
this
beer
is
very
common
among
college
age
students
because
it
is
easy
to
find
anywhere
and
it
is
very
inexpensive
definetly
a
bland
and
boring
beer
as
far
as
beer
goes
yet
somehow
it
refreshes
and
hits
the
spot
very
easy
drinking
for
a
pale
lager
transparent
clear
yellow
body
best
when
enjoyed
ice
cold
very
common
among
college
age
people
most
likely
because
of
the
inexpensive
aspect
of
this
beer
overall
an
enjoyable
experience
coors
light
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
very
transparent
body
the
head
retention
is
very
low
i
found
the
aroma
to
be
nonassertive
i
could
make
associations
to
sparkling
water
corn
and
minerals
the
mouthfeel
is
expectedly
light
with
fizzy
carbonation
flavor
notes
are
again
quite
mild
with
suggestions
of
seltzer
water
canned
corn
and
distant
grains
a
notion
of
european
hops
could
be
sensed
with
enough
concentration
coors
light
is
very
true
to
the
macroadjunct
lager
style
it
could
be
improved
in
my
opinion
with
a
bit
more
character
from
the
barley
and
hop
bill
still
mildly
refreshing
and
certainly
not
awful
or
flavorful
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
as
far
as
cheap
american
beer
goes
lets
get
one
thing
strait
theres
a
huge
difference
in
beers
referring
to
the
saying
you
get
what
you
pay
for
if
your
not
expecting
much
in
the
way
of
taste
but
more
for
fill
then
coors
light
fits
the
bill
it
has
a
good
taste
and
no
after
taste
though
a
little
watery
tasting
if
your
looking
for
some
thing
light
this
is
it
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
clearly
though
when
separating
men
from
boys
in
beer
sense
coors
light
is
still
a
boy
quite
honestly
this
is
the
worst
beer
on
the
planet
the
only
redeeming
quality
is
the
fact
that
it
does
have
alcohol
in
it
but
youd
be
better
served
to
add
a
few
drops
of
vodka
to
a
bottle
of
perrier
this
beer
will
always
be
popular
because
of
its
marketing
and
sponsorships
but
my
god
coors
light
i
give
credit
for
two
things
it
seems
to
get
colder
than
any
other
beer
and
it
is
about
only
choice
to
when
losing
weight
without
drinking
super
low
calorie
water
beers
miller
lite
sucks
so
bad
it
makes
coors
light
seem
elite
in
this
category
of
light
beers
coors
light
brewed
by
coors
this
brew
has
an
abv
4
2
the
brew
pours
out
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
coors
light
smells
like
beer
that
all
i
can
say
as
far
as
taste
there
is
not
much
there
it
is
like
drinking
water
with
a
hit
of
beer
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
but
there
could
be
more
to
it
to
me
it
is
to
light
but
is
drinkable
overall
i
give
this
brew
a
3
out
5
o
considering
the
price
this
is
a
terrible
excuse
for
beer
i
have
had
out
of
can
bottle
tap
and
directly
from
brewery
but
this
is
based
the
old
silver
bullet
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
head
quickly
disipates
into
the
yellowgold
donkey
piss
that
they
are
mislabeling
as
beer
nice
sweet
metallic
taste
thank
god
they
had
the
cold
indicator
on
there
i
tried
to
tell
by
touching
it
but
just
couldnt
be
sure
and
didnt
have
the
balls
to
try
it
this
stuff
makes
coors
original
taste
more
like
a
boston
lager
they
dont
even
have
good
tv
spots
anymore
remember
when
they
used
man
on
the
silver
mountain
seriously
is
anyone
reading
this
i
am
just
reviewing
to
kill
time
at
my
daughters
dance
practice
there
is
no
way
anyone
is
really
looking
at
coors
light
reviews
for
any
reason
other
than
their
daily
dose
of
sarcasm
i
could
probably
keep
my
bank
account
login
information
safe
here
anyway
if
you
feel
like
drinking
a
light
beer
drink
liqour
but
if
you
want
a
good
light
aal
this
is
not
a
good
one
i
would
recommend
yuengling
light
oby
far
my
favorite
adjunct
bmc
lager
othe
silver
bullet
is
obviously
meant
not
to
offend
anyone
because
it
does
not
provide
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
which
is
sort
of
offensive
im
not
one
to
simply
bash
a
beer
just
because
it
is
bmc
or
a
light
macro
lager
but
even
when
this
beer
is
compared
against
its
rivals
e
g
miller
lite
bud
light
etc
it
lacks
any
real
character
ba
says
that
reviews
should
have
something
constructive
but
thats
very
difficult
with
this
one
as
im
sure
most
of
us
on
here
are
not
generally
fans
of
american
mega
brewery
light
beers
i
have
a
hard
time
calling
this
beer
i
think
coors
light
stands
above
them
all
as
probably
the
worst
mass
produced
brew
from
any
major
company
it
is
simply
too
watered
down
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
and
i
will
sadly
admit
that
i
think
less
of
people
when
they
order
it
o
one
of
the
worlds
greatest
marketing
feats
was
to
convince
men
that
light
beers
like
this
which
were
originally
conceived
as
diet
beers
were
the
only
beers
a
man
should
ever
consider
drinking
now
its
so
entrenched
in
the
masculine
ideal
that
if
youre
not
chugging
a
can
of
this
and
crushing
it
against
your
skull
when
youre
through
youre
a
pussy
this
is
the
swill
i
proudly
drank
straight
through
high
school
and
right
into
my
latter
college
days
its
meant
to
pander
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
and
it
does
just
that
its
advantages
are
that
it
is
ubiquitous
affordable
and
lacking
in
any
offensive
character
its
drawbacks
are
that
it
really
lacks
any
meaningful
taste
or
character
at
all
its
low
in
alcohol
and
as
drinkable
as
seltzer
water
whats
manly
about
that
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
no
head
whatsoever
aromas
of
toast
and
not
much
else
a
little
bit
of
tangy
but
really
stretching
to
find
even
that
flavors
are
toasted
forward
with
a
butter
and
grainy
character
throughout
and
literally
nothing
more
very
watery
body
with
a
crispness
from
the
extremely
high
amount
of
carbonation
throughout
the
body
very
sharp
overly
crisp
finish
with
a
grainy
aftertaste
jesus
i
dont
know
how
i
drank
so
much
of
this
in
college
unless
youre
looking
for
quantity
quality
id
suggest
you
pick
up
another
beer
httpyoutu
bezpsovixjeg
people
that
drink
this
shit
are
clueless
i
love
craft
beer
more
than
the
next
guy
more
im
from
the
portland
metro
area
i
am
blessed
with
countless
microbreweries
from
seattle
to
pdx
however
i
love
coors
light
its
amazing
how
could
you
down
on
such
a
smooth
beer
love
is
all
i
have
for
it
overall
horrible
choice
for
anything
other
than
if
you
want
cheap
stuff
that
has
no
taste
to
drink
at
a
college
party
its
what
i
did
but
looking
back
i
probably
wouldve
been
better
off
buying
better
quality
beer
higher
alcohol
content
less
weight
to
carry
to
a
party
better
taste
get
drunk
faster
serving
type
bottle
overall
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
bmcs
but
definitely
not
the
worst
odourless
and
tasteless
yet
not
really
bad
just
not
very
beery
this
ticks
off
one
of
the
highest
reviewed
beers
id
never
had
before
the
main
reason
i
decided
to
have
a
glass
heineken
and
budweiser
are
my
next
bland
lager
targets
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
although
still
pretty
light
and
lackluster
but
thats
what
an
american
adjunct
lager
is
supposed
to
be
mb
average
at
best
for
a
light
beer
very
mild
average
and
bland
o
this
beer
is
only
good
for
one
thing
getting
drunk
the
lack
of
flavor
and
lightness
make
them
easy
to
pound
so
i
guess
it
gets
some
credit
for
that
2
50
the
beer
was
light
bodied
it
was
very
refreshing
the
picture
of
a
lawnmower
beer
i
left
no
film
and
finished
sweet
conclusion
what
im
really
trying
to
say
coors
light
is
good
when
you
just
finished
doing
some
work
especially
on
a
warm
day
according
to
the
can
it
has
107
calories
and
3
7
alcohol
something
else
that
may
appeal
to
you
while
there
may
be
sometimes
i
reach
for
an
old
rasputin
or
dogfish
head
90
coors
light
also
has
its
place
i
was
in
golden
so
of
course
i
had
to
go
well
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
coors
light
i
remember
a
soapy
taste
well
this
time
it
was
very
watery
it
didnt
taste
like
much
and
there
was
no
aroma
the
overall
what
no
so
good
but
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
myself
into
it
tastes
like
urine
and
smells
horrible
the
aftertaste
makes
me
want
to
gag
i
like
the
bottles
they
have
fun
blue
stuff
on
them
to
play
with
not
sure
how
always
being
cold
makes
it
any
better
since
it
sits
in
grocery
store
backrooms
where
it
is
not
cold
it
has
a
light
yellow
appearance
and
is
fizzy
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
smell
except
slightly
skunky
smooth
until
aftertaste
then
it
just
turns
bad
poor
guy
poured
from
draft
into
a
plastic
cup
at
a
local
music
club
pale
straw
in
appearance
with
a
soapy
head
that
dissapates
quickly
but
still
maintains
a
small
layer
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
of
the
cup
aroma
is
tangy
metallic
lightly
sweet
vegetable
lightly
grainy
no
discernible
aroma
of
hops
whatsoever
flavor
follows
nose
with
a
tangy
sour
metallic
flavor
dominating
hard
to
pinpoint
any
real
descriptive
flavors
or
anything
that
is
close
to
cereal
grains
or
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
but
thicker
than
water
and
the
carbonation
is
lighter
than
its
canned
counterpart
not
sure
if
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
light
american
lager
or
not
it
is
a
different
drink
entirely
than
what
i
would
consider
a
real
beer

drinkability
easily
drinkable
and
okay
for
when
you
dont
care
what
youre
drinking
but
for
now
stale

it
has
a
light
body
and
goes
down
fairly
easy
which
i
guess
is
average
for
the

overall
its

im
trying
to
be
unbiased
here
the
beer
was
mostly
plain
and
uninteresting
its
more
of
a
fizzy
sodalike
body
the
vented
can
deal
is
one
of
the
few
gimmicks
ive
seen
that
really
make
a
difference
it
allows
for
an
exceptionally
smooth
pour
and
i
dont
find
this
brew
anymore
offensive
than
most
other
macro
lights
if
anything
but
i
do
find
it
insulting

if
having
one
is

with

i
believe
the
combination
of
mass
brewing
with
low
flavor
ingredients
like
rice
to
replace
barley
and
poorly
cultured
yeasts
yield
a
massively
inferior
beer
this
is
truly
the
bottom
rung
of
beer
i
will
make
one
distinction
though
this
beer
improves
a
bit
when
it
is
very
cold
if
it
becomes
room
temperature
it
is
quite
bad

then
it
isnt

its
relatively
inexpensive
and
most
anyone
will
drink
it

you
have
a

of

coming

a
very
light
and
thin
beer
o
a
typical
mast
produced
lager
without
my
thought
or
flavor
put
into
i
cant
believe
i
would
drink
this
stuff
in
college
but
it
was
cheap
and
available
overall
i
hope
i
rarely
if
never
have
to
have
coors
light
again
coors
originalbanquet
is
actually
pretty
good
but
this
light
beer
is
just
awful
if
you
want
a
light
beer
stick
with
something
else
and
stay
away
from
this
ogood
for
very
hot
summer
days
when
you
are
not
doing
anything
strenuous
if
you
were
to
offer
me
one
ill
take
it
just
as
long
as
its
not
accompanying
food
overall
as
far
as
the
mass
produced
american
beers
go
this
sits
with
the
rest
of
them
nothing
spectacular
and
other
than
the
fact
that
it
goes
down
like
well
water
it
leaves
everything
to
be
desired
overall
nothing
surprising
about
this
one
it
looks
like
a
light
lager
it
tastes
like
one
too
but
for
those
budget
30
pack
fans
heres
your
golden
calf
t
yeah
this
isnt
good
theres
a
bit
of
a
sweetness
to
it
and
a
faint
hint
of
grassy
hops
but
everything
tastes
way
watered
down
drinking
this
warm
is
a
feat
best
not
to
let
it
get
to
that
point
pound
it
while
its
cold
or
better
yet
stay
away
altogether
i
dont
really
think
this
beer
serves
any
purpose
other
than
freezing
your
tongue
off
it
some
time
has
hints
of
banana
which
is
on
and
off
sometimes
i
think
this
beer
is
way
better
than
a
busch
though
still
this
beer
is
just
for
lame
parties
they
should
stop
bragging
about
how
cold
their
beer
is
and
maybe
work
on
some
of
the
flavor
or
smoothness
buy
lots
and
get
girls
drunk
thus
the
relatively
high
rating
pours
light
straw
almost
colorless
thin
and
fizzy
aroma
of
stale
nothingness
tastes
of
what
comes
out
of
a
cow
after
spending
too
much
time
drinking
from
a
puddle
d
light
watery
mouthfeel
and
although
it
goes
down
like
water
it
leaves
a
deathly
aftertaste
and
is
to
be
avoided
at
all
costs
other
than
see
first
sentence
well
the
first
thing
i
notice
with
this
beer
when
i
pour
it
is
that
i
can
hear
the
head
fizzing
away
like
soda
the
bubbles
are
small
so
the
head
looks
nice
but
i
can
tell
it
will
be
gone
in
seconds
in
fact
in
the
time
its
taken
me
to
write
this
a
two
finger
head
is
now
gone
terrible
other
than
that
it
looks
like
water
with
yellow
color
in
it
completely
see
through
for
the
smell
well
it
smells
sour
maybe
a
little
malt
no
hops
on
the
nose
at
all
just
generic
bad
beer
smell
i
think
i
might
even
smell
water
which
is
amazing
as
for
taste
its
coors
so
its
not
the
worst
adjunct
lager
ive
ever
had
in
fact
its
one
of
the
better
ones
with
that
being
said
its
still
a
crappy
crappy
adjunct
lager
almost
no
taste
all
i
get
it
water
carbonation
and
a
little
malt
and
then
some
adjunctycoors
taste
it
doesnt
taste
god
awful
like
some
beers
do
but
its
still
not
a
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
horrible
drinkability
is
ok
just
because
it
doesnt
taste
gross
and
its
really
light
overall
below
average
beer
but
on
the
better
side
of
the
adjunct
lager
beers
aroma
is
different
from
water
but
the
body
not
by
much
taste
is
also
slightly
different
from
water
at
least
the
brew
is
not
disgusting
i
can
drink
it
when
i
am
very
thirsty
m
sort
of
of
setting
after
taste
but
this
is
a
party
beer
and
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
120th
overall
a
leader
among
light
us
lagers
and
the
official
beer
of
my
uncle
jimmy
a
craft
enthusiast
will
not
enjoy
this
as
much
o
oh
how
i
remember
the
days
while
the
silver
bullet
is
poundable
the
taste
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
just
not
good
at
all
all
in
all
if
i
were
in
the
deep
south
standing
next
to
my
broken
down
vehicle
on
a
hot
and
humid
july
day
a
cooler
full
of
these
would
be
a
real
welcome
sight
and
would
seem
downright
apropos
just
make
sure
those
danged
mountains
are
blue
and
it
honestly
doesnt
really
smell
like
anything
unless
you
spill
it
on
a
hot
sunny
day
not
impressed
id
have
to
be
either
super
thirsty
or
out
of
beer
and
water
to
have
the
other
one
in
my
fridge
drink
i
shouldnt
have
bitten
the
bullet
it
was
just
flavorless
no
real
reason
to
have
one
of
these
other
than
to
say
you
are
drinking
a
beer
no
fullness
on
the
drink
no
real
flavor
d
its
low
abv
and
high
watercontent
allows
you
to
slug
back
a
whole
lot
of
these
in
one
evening
but
the
lack
of
flavor
in
any
form
means
that
i
only
choose
to
when
the
temperature
rises
above
90
this
beer
has
its
place
in
my
fridge
that
place
is
waaay
in
the
back
available
for
consumption
after
mowing
the
lawn
and
a
cheap
option
to
provide
for
guests
who
would
honestly
prefer
this
over
an
ipa
or
a
stout
anyway
for
those
reasons
and
those
reasons
alone
it
isnt
a
complete
and
utter
failure
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
find
it
easy
to
drink
and
a
refreshing
taste
i
dont
however
think
this
is
a
beer
beer
its
a
easy
drink
drinkability
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
of
if
only
because
theres
little
flavor
bubbly
slightly
sweet
drinkability
im
finding
it
hard
to
finish
this
beer
this
is
a
little
sad
the
taste
while
very
bland
has
no
obvious
flaws
so
it
is
ok
for
what
it
is
and
it
is
crisp
with
slight
adjunct
flavor
giving
a
mild
sweet
effect
and
it
finishes
clean
without
any
hop
flavor
or
real
malt
to
speak
of
the
drinkability
is
not
great
i
would
not
order
this
normally
since
it
really
lacks
much
in
the
way
of
beer
flavor
simply
comes
off
as
a
fizzy
sodalike
malt
beverage
or
a
palate
cleanser
i
do
think
it
fits
within
the
style
ok
but
generally
i
would
avoid
this
unless
light
lagers
are
your
thing
drinkability
average
what
else
can
i
say
saying
this
beer
has
bad
drinkability
is
like
saying
water
has
bad
drinkability
my
final
impression
whats
the
point
in
drinking
this
its
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
but
want
something
cheap
with
alcohol
in
it
crystal
clear
and
very
pale
yellow
it
had
a
nice
head
after
the
initial
pour
but
it
drops
to
almost
nothing
after
a
minute
or
so
looks
weak
very
clean
and
somewhat
fruity
aroma
smells
weak
tastes
much
like
it
smells
imagine
a
pilsener
had
all
traces
of
hops
removed
from
it
before
having
adult
relations
with
a
bucket
of
water
this
beer
would
be
the
result
of
such
a
union
its
the
typical
lager
gold
color
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
wheat
and
not
much
else
the
taste
light
wheat
and
corn
but
not
much
of
them
it
goes
down
super
easy
and
finishes
clean
the
body
is
typical
for
the
style
for
a
light
lager
its
decent
but
for
the
typical
beer
geek
theres
plenty
of
brews
out
there
that
would
be
more
satisfying
in
short
its
light
and
thin
but
clean
pouring
down
drain
now
a
great
beer
however
beer
snobs
should
avoid
d
in
the
summer
on
a
boat
on
the
lake
in
90
degree98
percent
humidity
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
its
the
most
drinkable
one
out
of
all
the
american
light
beers
this
beer
tastes
much
better
out
of
the
tap
than
the
bottle
or
can
the
thing
that
stands
out
most
is
the
great
tasteand
the
thing
that
i
dislike
the
most
is
there
is
no
smell
and
the
color
is
similar
to
water
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
i
recommend
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
while
watching
a
baseball
game
water
please
this
is
such
a
watered
down
beer
flavorless
my
wife
drinks
this
and
prefers
it
from
the
bottle
if
i
had
to
choose
to
drink
this
it
would
be
from
tap
only
this
would
be
the
last
choice
of
beers
to
drink
besides
schlitz
lol
i
dont
want
to
seem
like
im
ripping
it
apart
but
this
is
not
a
beer
to
sit
down
and
drink
over
and
over
again
d
if
i
was
still
in
college
this
would
get
a
high
rating
on
drinkability
because
it
gets
you
drunk
for
cheap
and
its
not
very
filling
however
im
not
anymore
i
would
never
drink
this
beer
drinkability
its
a
smooth
beer
but
it
is
way
to
watered
down
perfect
if
your
just
looking
to
get
drunk
but
even
there
its
gonna
take
you
alot
of
these
little
body
and
very
little
hop
bite
zero
aftertaste
but
i
think
that
is
the
point
bought
it
in
a
bottle
and
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
old
faithful
is
what
a
lot
call
it
its
my
safety
beer
everyone
drinks
it
nobody
hates
it
except
the
nra
haha
it
pours
a
very
light
yellow
color
it
smells
alcoholic
its
the
average
persons
beer
it
goes
down
really
smooth
and
is
very
drinkable
it
leaves
the
palate
of
a
person
who
has
drank
craft
beers
looking
for
more
but
is
very
refreshing
after
cutting
the
grass
while
cutting
the
grass
easiest
beer
to
drink
pours
a
very
very
pale
yellow
color
its
actually
even
more
pale
than
i
thought
it
was
bit
of
an
alcohol
smell
to
it
pretty
weak
taste
not
a
lot
of
flavor
not
a
bad
taste
but
it
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
smooth
drinking
beer
this
beer
is
probably
best
consumed
in
quantity
in
a
world
of
beer
pong
and
tailgates
where
youll
drink
a
million
beers
over
the
course
of
5
hours
the
silver
bullet
is
the
true
king
of
beers
its
never
ending
ability
to
provide
small
doses
of
alcohol
in
between
good
beers
when
you
are
getting
piss
yourself
drunk
is
second
to
none
a
little
pricey
for
what
you
get
it
should
cost
no
more
than
natural
ice
but
we
are
slaves
to
ad
costs
whether
it
is
for
a
beer
bong
or
a
keg
cup
coors
light
is
the
choice
of
champions
just
dont
think
you
are
going
to
be
savoring
the
last
drops
of
this
one
the
silver
bullet
good
for
2
things
killin
warewolves
and
pounding
until
you
cant
stand
up
i
like
to
take
coors
light
tailgating
because
i
can
drink
these
things
like
water
when
im
in
a
pinch
for
time
the
taste
is
bland
not
much
flavor
here
so
you
dont
mind
it
when
it
dribbles
down
you
chin
onto
your
shirt
and
then
onto
the
ground
i
have
a
late
cousin
that
drank
this
religiously
so
ill
crack
one
open
in
memory
of
him
sometimes
all
usefullness
aside
theres
nothing
special
about
coors
light
i
must
say
though
when
its
ice
cold
i
have
been
know
to
drink
these
like
a
bastard
had
this
in
many
different
cities
across
this
great
land
and
its
too
bad
this
was
my
beer
of
choice
when
i
was
a
young
lad
not
at
all
what
i
would
consider
to
be
a
choice
for
drinking
now
i
would
much
rather
have
water
and
wont
even
offer
to
my
friends
i
rated
this
high
in
drinkability
because
i
think
you
can
drink
your
own
weight
of
this
stuff
pours
a
very
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
finger
off
white
foamy
head
that
disapears
fast
nose
is
also
pale
phenol
grain
yeast
and
grass
taste
is
bland
and
mediorce
water
grain
grassy
and
very
light
in
flavour
also
light
in
mouthfeel
watery
fair
drinkabiliry
in
that
they
are
easy
to
drown
a
couple
at
any
time
ive
had
my
share
of
these
since
its
my
dads
goto
my
choice
if
im
with
him
and
theres
no
craft
options
otherwise
dont
waste
your
time
drinks
poorly
at
best
overall
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
one
of
those
allday
summer
events
like
a
beach
party
bbqetc
goes
down
smooth
easy
refreshes
and
quenches
the
thirst
the
low
abv
makes
it
so
you
can
enjoy
several
while
engaged
in
a
fun
outdoor
summer
activity
with
your
buddies
also
its
light
refreshing
enough
for
people
who
are
not
real
beer
drinkers
to
enjoy
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
it
does
have
its
place
in
the
beer
world
drinkability
easy
and
like
drinking
carbonated
water
i
remembered
drinking
this
beer
when
i
got
introduced
to
alcohol
and
remembering
it
was
shit
fast
forward
about
nine
years
where
i
actually
enjoy
beer
and
this
memory
doesnt
surprise
me
one
bit
when
attempting
to
enjoy
it
now
drink
craft
beers
rjt
water
anyone
just
another
utterly
weak
nearly
flavorless
light
beer
kind
of
like
if
you
pack
a
glass
to
the
top
with
ice
cubes
then
drop
in
a
shot
or
two
of
regular
coors
and
walk
away
long
enough
for
the
ice
to
melt
tada
coors
light
the
only
saving
grace
is
theres
really
nothing
to
be
offended
by
something
would
have
to
be
in
it
in
order
for
you
to
ask
for
something
to
take
out
of
it
d
not
so
bad
of
a
beer
to
drink
at
a
bowling
alley
to
keep
up
with
the
boys
but
nothing
to
seek
out
otherwise
i
always
dog
my
friend
for
constanly
drinking
this
i
think
he
likes
the
moutnains
easily
amused
dude
ha
not
to
wax
philosophical
here
but
i
tend
to
think
beers
like
this
are
popular
simply
because
they
are
drinkable
one
can
easily
down
this
without
getting
full
and
if
ones
intentions
are
purely
to
get
drunk
i
guess
this
makes
sense
but
once
youve
crossed
over
to
the
world
of
craft
brew
this
one
must
be
left
behind
and
utilized
only
in
the
most
desperate
of
situations
not
one
of
the
best
or
even
the
decent
i
advise
staying
away
from
macro
light
beers
all
together
because
of
their
lack
of
flavor
and
pizzaz
but
if
you
have
to
there
are
better
choices
drinkability
this
would
be
bearable
if
i
were
cutting
the
grass
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
and
needed
to
quench
my
thirst
but
water
would
work
better
d
umm
not
the
worst
beer
ever
sold
to
the
masses
but
when
your
selling
points
are
blue
mountains
and
not
tasting
unpleasant
your
not
aiming
high
enough
i
didnt
really
expect
much
from
this
one
and
have
never
been
too
impressed
when
ive
had
it
hundreds
of
times
before
after
close
inspection
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
one
of
the
least
offensive
light
lagers
its
still
only
half
beer
but
it
plays
its
cards
right
and
can
be
consumed
like
cold
water
in
the
most
desolate
desert
d
well
if
youre
looking
to
drink
a
lot
of
beer
quickly
without
enjoying
it
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
its
cheap
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
and
the
taste
is
so
watered
down
that
you
cant
help
but
keep
drinking
it
hoping
to
find
some
sort
of
lost
taste
or
at
the
very
least
something
to
commend
coors
on
doing
well
but
thats
not
the
point
of
coors
light
the
point
of
it
is
to
be
easy
to
drink
and
light
on
taste
which
coors
does
exceptionally
well
2
out
of
5
widely
available
try
one
or
dont
bottled
water
has
arrived
well
its
not
water
but
it
might
as
well
be
it
tastes
like
poorly
treated
well
water
lots
of
minerals
lots
of
iron
no
hop
taste
very
light
malt
flavor
you
can
drink
alot
of
it
since
it
has
almost
no
flavor
and
an
abv
below
5
but
there
is
no
real
reason
too
it
does
get
high
drinkability
though
because
water
is
pretty
drinkable
notes
theyre
not
the
strongest
beers
but
at
the
same
time
if
you
drink
a
lot
of
them
you
dont
have
to
worry
about
taping
out
a
lot
of
the
local
stores
near
here
serve
them
from
a
6pack
up
to
a
30pack
prices
are
some
what
cheep
so
by
all
means
have
at
it
a
decent
fall
back
beer
for
hard
times
really
drinkability
this
was
my
go
to
beer
before
i
started
drinking
craftbeer
i
havent
had
it
for
about
3
12
yrs
it
is
easily
drinkable
but
so
much
more
is
out
there
that
can
do
what
this
beer
can
and
more
as
far
as
being
thirst
quenching
being
refreshing
and
ease
of
drink
i
would
only
drink
this
to
fit
in
or
if
it
was
all
that
was
available
overall
pretty
standard
for
a
macro
brewed
light
very
small
amount
of
flavor
and
depth
i
cannot
understand
why
people
drink
this
stuff
unless
they
just
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
d
easy
as
water
to
drink
down
a
case
of
these
and
not
get
drunk
may
as
well
drink
a
glass
of
water
it
is
better
in
bottles
i
wouldnt
drink
this
bad
boy
unless
it
was
the
only
thing
a
buddy
has
on
hand
after
a
hard
days
work
i
would
get
a
finger
of
fizzy
bonewhite
head
briefly
after
the
pour
but
it
would
disappear
as
quickly
as
my
students
after
the
bell
rings
color
was
a
light
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
faintly
lager
sweet
but
with
an
adjunct
scent
also
more
rice
than
corn
but
still
pretty
bland
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
fizzy
like
drinking
pop
the
taste
was
so
bland
and
nearly
nonexistent
that
i
found
myself
wondering
why
i
had
bothered
finish
was
nearly
tasteless
watery
and
bland
i
had
a
better
time
drinking
all
of
that
malt
likker
yesterday
at
least
they
tasted
like
something
only
scores
as
high
here
as
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
not
much
in
the
way
of
taste
or
anything
else
for
that
matter
d
wanna
watch
the
game
with
your
buddies
and
get
wasted
this
is
probably
the
beer
for
you
wheres
the
chips
and
salsa
i
can
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
especially
when
my
focus
its
on
the
beer
goes
down
like
water
best
way
to
drink
the
beer
is
on
tap
or
keg
not
a
beer
for
those
who
actually
enjoy
beer
best
if
drank
with
country
music
friends
and
a
fishing
pole
d
as
light
lagers
go
it
is
average
maybe
slightly
worse
than
a
bud
light
but
that
doesnt
say
much
i
will
never
understand
why
people
drink
these
coors
light
has
a
terrible
verylight
straw
colour
but
the
head
on
mine
was
actually
decent
i
smelled
nothing
even
when
i
dipped
my
nose
in
the
stuff
it
doesnt
have
much
flavour
the
main
thing
i
get
is
corn
in
the
middle
and
aftertaste
this
beer
is
flavourless
but
drinkable
but
you
already
knew
that
d
ideal
for
beer
bonging
nothing
else
cold
activated
can
and
vented
wide
mouth
do
nothing
to
help
this
beer
one
finger
head
sounded
like
soda
pop
and
evaporated
in
seconds
straw
color
resembles
a
3
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
that
of
wet
corn
and
straw
taste
like
corn
rice
and
sweet
malt
but
has
a
mold
flavor
mouthfeel
is
that
of
fizzy
water
this
beer
is
cheep
and
there
is
a
reason
for
it
i
think
i
will
pass
on
any
more
of
this
unless
there
is
nothing
else
and
i
am
already
drunk
and
thirsty
really
thirsty
pours
pale
straw
yellow
tons
of
effervescence
ha
no
head
retention
at
all
lot
and
lots
of
bubbles
how
fun
gosh
the
smell
is
very
solvent
acetonelike
with
some
sweetness
from
all
those
adjuncts
just
took
a
sip
wow
nothing
really
there
unfortunately
what
is
there
is
an
aftertaste
of
gluesolvent
i
swear
i
do
not
know
how
people
can
drink
these
just
from
all
the
weird
off
flavors
it
would
make
me
vomit
pretty
fast
this
has
a
low
abv
but
could
never
be
a
session
brew
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
prickly
and
grating
on
the
tongue
with
all
the
bad
things
going
on
in
the
brew
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
chance
i
was
slightly
surprised
by
a
few
of
my
macro
picks
lately
i
mean
they
werent
quite
as
awful
as
i
thought
was
hoping
this
might
do
something
but
make
me
feel
nauseous
down
the
drain
we
go
overall
if
you
have
to
freeze
the
tastebuds
to
slide
something
past
them
the
product
sucks
but
the
silver
bullet
is
in
fact
better
than
bud
light
if
that
means
anything
i
usually
dont
review
quizzo
beers
but
since
ive
yet
to
review
it
i
see
no
is
as
good
of
a
time
as
any
this
beer
pours
clear
i
think
there
might
be
some
yellow
in
there
but
it
really
just
looks
like
water
the
smell
has
the
adjunct
aromas
but
they
actually
arent
really
that
offputting
in
fact
they
might
be
construed
by
some
as
sweet
though
the
aroma
is
fairly
nonexistent
in
the
first
place
which
ive
learned
isnt
really
all
that
bad
the
taste
is
a
light
lager
theres
not
really
anything
too
it
it
served
its
purpose
as
cold
beer
god
help
you
if
you
let
it
warm
up
its
really
easy
to
drink
it
goes
down
smooth
it
really
is
best
enjoy
if
you
really
dont
focus
on
what
you
are
drinking
and
just
drink
it
the
subtle
imperfections
will
go
unnoticed
the
problem
is
i
was
looking
for
all
of
them
it
still
will
be
my
go
to
beer
if
im
forced
to
pick
a
bmc
product
but
since
thats
not
the
case
thank
god
for
that
ill
leave
it
on
the
shelves
for
the
people
who
dont
know
any
better
overall
not
much
more
than
a
throwaway
beer
thats
good
for
beer
pong
and
college
parties
its
like
20
for
a
30
pack
at
a
convenience
store
dont
drink
this
if
you
can
avoid
it
it
has
the
taste
of
a
watery
flavorless
lager
its
not
offensive
but
far
from
tasty
theres
high
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
youre
just
looking
to
slam
a
few
back
quickly
or
are
playing
drinking
games
it
is
very
refreshing
when
ice
cold
and
enjoyed
on
a
hot
summer
day
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thick
at
first
head
which
quickly
dissipates
and
zero
lacing
smells
of
grain
and
water
not
much
else
very
clean
taste
like
barley
soda
malty
maybe
a
little
yeast
bread
not
the
worst
adjunct
ive
had
to
date
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
tons
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
i
reviewed
bud
light
in
which
i
know
not
a
lot
of
people
are
impressed
by
it
i
think
coors
light
is
worse
than
bud
light
the
color
resembles
rain
water
after
a
cat
pissed
in
it
there
was
no
foam
at
the
top
after
the
pour
was
complete
the
taste
was
very
unimpressive
i
couldnt
see
my
self
drinking
more
than
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
would
rather
not
have
one
again
when
coming
in
a
bottle
it
is
relatively
tolerable
i
would
not
recommend
it
yeah
its
a
lame
beer
i
didnt
expect
anything
else
remind
me
not
to
go
places
that
have
nothing
better
on
tap
light
watery
body
with
no
substantial
attribute
for
drinkability
unappealing
and
unattractive
from
top
to
bottom
great
job
coors
d
since
its
very
watery
its
drinkability
is
not
bad
nevertheless
i
suggest
a
bottle
of
water
instead
d
why
does
anyone
want
to
pay
for
this
swill
it
has
no
character
and
is
like
a
mild
beer
flavored
cooler
id
rather
just
drink
pop
than
this
and
i
will
not
be
buying
this
in
the
future
i
have
had
and
have
chinese
beer
that
is
better
than
this
and
thats
generally
not
great
beer
either
i
will
say
that
it
is
easy
to
drink
though
bc
it
really
isnt
like
drinking
beer
why
cant
molsoncoors
bring
coors
banquet
beer
up
north
at
least
thats
half
decent
another
quizzo
brew
it
pours
a
clear
jaundice
topped
by
somewhere
around
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
wheat
rice
corn
corn
syrup
and
grass
the
taste
really
doesnt
bring
anything
new
to
the
table
aside
from
the
usual
hard
water
flavor
that
accompanies
these
damn
adjunct
lagers
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
sharp
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
watery
feel
overall
if
these
things
werent
so
cheap
i
dont
think
many
would
continue
to
drink
them
that
said
it
served
its
purpose
as
mild
lubricant
during
quizzo
so
it
had
that
going
for
it
the
blue
mountains
were
kinda
neat
though
mouthfeel
is
more
or
less
standard
for
the
style
lightbodied
watery
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
this
beers
major
selling
point
which
isnt
saying
much
marketed
to
a
younger
demographic
more
interested
in
quantify
than
quality
imo
coors
light
succeeds
to
some
degree
inoffensive
and
super
light
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
i
just
dont
see
the
point
drinkability
none
at
all
after
the
third
gulp
i
wanted
to
throw
up
again
and
again
it
was
just
too
much
carbonation
to
drink
so
disgusting
i
would
never
drink
that
again
can
ok
so
i
had
one
of
these
in
the
fridge
left
over
from
a
get
together
and
decided
to
rate
it
beer
poured
from
a
can
meant
for
well
probably
left
in
the
can
but
ill
pour
it
into
a
glass
pours
a
very
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
very
fizzy
white
head
that
pops
its
little
bubbles
pretty
frantically
whats
left
of
the
head
after
it
settles
is
very
little
head
at
all
no
lace
at
all
the
aroma
is
that
of
sweet
baby
corn
but
nothing
really
else
pretty
non
descript
the
taste
is
pretty
non
descript
as
well
until
you
get
this
lingering
off
flavor
in
the
end
semi
sweet
up
front
the
carbonation
on
this
is
pretty
high
and
gets
in
the
way
of
any
real
flavors
that
may
be
there
pretty
light
mouthfeel
in
the
world
of
beers
how
does
this
rate
well
pretty
bad
im
sure
there
are
worse
but
i
would
go
micro
any
day
of
the
week
instead
of
grabbing
one
of
these
i
can
take
these
down
all
day
especially
if
drinking
games
are
involved
way
too
easy
though
honestly
though
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
party
beer
go
buy
pabst
blue
ribbon
or
the
canned
watered
down
version
of
schlitz
theyre
both
cheap
adjunct
lagers
but
theyre
well
done
cheap
adjunct
lagers
tap
into
the
something
else
what
the
hell
one
of
the
best
light
lagers
out
there
easy
drinking
and
perfect
after
a
hot
grass
cutting
day
not
alot
of
flavor
but
hey
this
is
light
beer
no
off
flavors
and
nicely
carbonated
at
around
3
8
this
is
a
really
good
all
day
drinker
if
you
are
at
a
lake
sporting
event
concert
or
bbq
the
fact
that
the
mountains
turn
blue
when
its
cold
brilliant
drinkability
if
you
like
fizzy
yellow
water
than
it
could
be
drank
all
day
i
probably
wouldnt
order
this
even
if
i
was
out
and
this
was
all
they
had
on
tap
more
marketing
less
taste
thats
the
coors
light
way
d
it
is
sweet
and
watery
and
has
no
real
taste
to
it
why
not
buy
yuengling
or
pbr
same
price
much
better
taste
and
also
easy
drinking
drinkability
is
all
this
beer
has
going
for
it
if
you
want
to
piss
all
night
its
what
it
was
made
for
getting
drunk
and
thats
it
plain
and
simple
out
of
all
the
big
macro
light
lagers
out
there
this
is
one
of
the
worst
thats
kind
of
like
being
the
smartest
kid
on
the
short
bus
drinkability
is
all
this
beer
has
going
for
it
its
what
it
was
made
for
and
thats
it
plain
and
simple
out
of
all
the
big
macro
light
lagers
out
there
this
is
one
of
the
worst
thats
kind
of
like
being
the
smartest
kid
on
the
short
bus
final
thoughts
drinkable
and
sessionable
thats
definitely
the
only
point
to
this
beer
as
well
as
the
marketing
campaign
but
would
certainly
not
be
my
first
choice
at
the
beer
store
its
watery
ive
never
had
it
from
the
bottle
but
the
out
of
the
can
has
that
bad
aluminum
taste
despite
some
sort
of
fake
liner
they
put
in
but
hey
the
mountains
turn
blue
on
the
side
in
case
you
have
no
sense
of
coldhot
i
will
never
purchase
this
beer
but
will
have
one
if
its
available
and
free
if
the
mountains
arent
blue
i
would
recommend
not
drinking
it
obviously
this
is
a
really
generic
beer
that
is
about
equivalent
to
tap
water
in
terms
of
excitement
mainly
people
drink
it
because
it
contains
alcohol
and
sodium
the
best
thing
you
can
say
about
it
is
that
it
is
not
foul
tasting
goes
well
with
v8
d
you
can
chug
it
you
can
also
chug
pond
water
it
would
be
about
the
same
dfor
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
highest
in
the
style
is
a
b
or
something
still
i
will
pass
unless
i
need
to
be
drunk
and
fast
theres
just
nothing
to
coors
light
it
is
more
clear
than
yellow
hardly
any
head
hardly
any
real
aroma
light
corn
taste
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
watery
thin
no
aftertaste
its
drinkable
if
you
simply
want
a
buzz
and
its
the
only
beer
around
otherwise
no
thanks
lets
face
it
its
not
a
great
beer
but
i
do
like
drinking
coors
light
if
im
hanging
out
at
a
friends
house
during
a
bbq
or
watching
football
games
ps
go
chargers
the
main
reason
i
like
them
is
you
can
drink
6
to
8
with
out
being
really
buzzed
the
water
flavor
is
not
bad
and
the
feel
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
color
is
your
basic
american
domistic
gold
the
plus
side
you
can
pick
up
a
18
pack
for
around
10
to
12
bucks
pours
a
very
lightly
hued
yellow
nearly
translucent
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
very
considerable
head
this
looks
like
dirty
water
or
perhaps
urine
smell
is
a
funky
unpleasant
aroma
that
i
cant
really
pinpoint
taste
is
barely
discernible
as
beer
say
but
i
think
im
really
trying
to
smell
something
taste
is
pretty
much
almost
beer
flavoured
carbonated
water
pretty
much
just
watered
down
beer
that
is
ultra
fizzy
that
makes
it
harder
to
choke
down

it
has
little
to
no
mouthfeel
if
you
want
a
general
comsumption
light
beer
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
drank
ice
cold
it
reminds
me
of
a
glass
of
water
into
which
someone
accidentally
poured
in
a
little
beer
i
understand
the
mass
market
for
beer
in
the
usa
is
young
adults
who
prefer
quantity
over
quality
coors
light
is
perfect
for
that
audience
you
can
drink
it
like
water
because
it
is
water
tap
the
rockies
according
to
style
i
think
coors
light
meets
the
objectives
pretty
well
it
has
a
bit
more
of
a
cleaner
profile
than
bm
very
light
and
non
filling
as
you
would
expect
drinkable
if
this
is
your
type
of
style
i
may
have
learned
that
i
would
choose
a
cl
over
bl
or
ml
if
someone
is
handing
them
out
drinkability
if
i
want
water
ill
drink
water
if
i
want
a
beer
ill
look
for
one
with
a
taste
pointless
reviewk
but
what
the
hey
pours
an
almost
clear
bubbly
fizzy
watery
yellow
without
much
of
a
head
besides
a
few
bubbles
at
the
top
smells
like
a
frat
house
at
3am
after
everyone
left
and
the
floor
is
covered
in
sticky
beer
residue
and
empty
cans
taste
is
bland
and
uninteresting
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
very
watery
drinkability
is
poor
this
just
tastes
like
nothing
i
like
it
better
than
bud
and
miller
light
but
frankly
i
cant
imagine
someone
drinking
this
for
any
reason
other
than
to
get
drunk
or
so
they
can
show
off
that
they
had
a
beer
d
this
beer
is
not
for
me
or
a
lot
of
people
who
drink
for
the
taste
not
the
effect
i
am
not
impressed
at
all
with
this
beer
ill
pass
it
up
anytime
i
can
one
thing
thats
always
baffled
me
it
has
a
faint
banana
taste
to
it
what
the
hells
up
with
that
this
is
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
light
beer
i
dont
really
drink
light
beer
so
that
isnt
saying
much
but
if
im
looking
to
play
a
bunch
of
drinking
games
with
is
what
i
would
go
with
every
time
d
because
of
very
little
taste
and
feel
it
will
pass
some
what
on
a
hot
day
if
im
about
to
die
of
lack
of
beer
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
when
you
want
to
just
slam
something
sadly
this
beer
is
not
for
me
or
a
lot
of
people
who
drink
for
the
taste
not
the
effect
i
am
not
impressed
at
all
with
this
beer
ill
pass
it
up
anytime
i
can
d
drinkable
only
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
anything
below
miller
light
and
bud
light
in
my
book
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
12
oz
can
found
this
silver
bullet
all
the
way
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
it
was
hiding
behind
a
bottle
of
orval
which
i
will
be
enjoying
next
after
this
soontobe
disaster
i
will
not
even
give
this
sorry
excuse
for
a
beer
the
luxury
of
sitting
in
my
leffe
glass
so
ive
decided
to
just
gulp
it
down
right
out
of
the
can
you
can
only
drink
this
ice
cold
and
if
you
let
it
warm
up
you
might
as
well
just
throw
it
out
a
good
thing
the
mountains
on
my
can
were
blue
an
indication
to

or
you
will
be
sorry
later

choice
for
any
reunion
where
your
friends
think
budweiser
is
the
best
beer
in
the
world
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
pours
a
beautiful
piss
yellow
color
bland
smell
its
a
light
watered
down
beer
doesnt
taste
bad
but
not
good
either
good
drinkability
for
parties
other
wise
its
a
nogo
from
me
d
well
if
theres
a
saving
grace
of
this
beer
this
is
it
it
is
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
it
is
nearly
tasteless
so
that
you
can
drink
it
quickly
and
easily
cheers
as
a
college
student
coors
is
my
daily
bread
as
jesus
was
to
beer
it
sucks
the
mouthfeel
taste
and
smell
are
horrible
yet
because
im
in
college
and
i
drink
this
all
the
time
the
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
good
so
damn
bubbly
this
beer
will
make
you
burp
all
day
long
dont
be
fooled
by
their
flashy
blue
mountains
bullshit
this
beer
is
shit
however
drink
coors
light
on
a
hot
day
and
you
will
think
your
rehydrating
yourself
with
pure
natural
spring
water
drink
it
as
a
refreshment
nothing
else
if
you
prefer
pissy
water
drink
coors
piss
if
not
pbr
yuengling
and
a
lot
of
other
beers
are
cheaper
and
much
tastier
overall
nothing
special
just
your
run
of
the
mill
light
american
lager
is
anyone
really
rating
this
beer
objectively
its
tough
to
drinkability
psh
thats
bud
lights
slogan
mr
cold
as
the
rockies
negative
anyway
dont
drink
this
unless
someone
is
threataning
your
life
final
thoughts
as
one
of
the
beers
that
most
bas
love
to
hate
the
silver
bullet
isnt
as
bad
as
everyone
makes
it
out
to
be
now
im
not
saying
i
like
it
but
its
pretty
much
the
standard
for
the
light
lager
style
if
you
are
looking
to
have
a
couple
with
the
boys
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
have
to
drive
home
then
yeah
maybe
get
coors
light
d
exceptional
you
could
easily
drink
six
of
these
and
be
none
the
wiser
im
not
saying
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
due
to
its
close
resemblance
to
water
and
minimal
aftertaste
there
is
not
much
to
review
here
standard
pour
with
the
classic
transparent
straw
color
mineral
and
metallic
nose
along
with
corn
and
grain
light
in
body
very
rough
around
the
edges
this
is
perhaps
my
worst
review
ive
written
but
it
gets
old
reviewing
the
same
shit
drinkability
surefire
crowd
pleaser
for
the
college
mentality
to
drinking
light
and
slammable
in
the
light
beer
category
its
a
decent
rank
but
as
an
overall
id
say
only
if
i
was
on
a
budget
and
counting
calories
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
12
inch
head
and
virtually
no
carbonation
smell
is
of
mild
corn
and
malts
taste
is
well
there
is
none
i
guess
like
beer
flavored
water
feels
watery
in
the
mouth
o
k
i
have
to
give
it
to
them
on
drinkability
great
for
chugging
or
drinking
games
otherwise
avoid
d
pretty
low
i
mean
if
its
this
or
water
the
water
has
fewer
calories
and
i
dont
mean
that
to
bash
the
beer
its
just
that
if
im
going
to
take
some
calories
i
want
something
for
it
like
flavor
but
that
didnt
me
from
drinking
bathtub
size
portions
of
this
in
college
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
it
just
has
little
unique
qualilties
that
dont
stand
out
but
i
will
still
drink
it
d
this
beer
sucks
the
coldactivated
cans
and
bottles
is
just
marketing
nonsense
to
hide
the
fact
that
their
beer
is
terrible
not
that
i
like
to
drink
light
beers
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
this
is
little
more
than
slightly
alcoholic
carbonated
water
sure
you
could
drink
it
pretty
easily
if
you
wanted
to
but
why
would
you
when
there
are
so
many
other
options
out
there
at
least
other
things
have
flavor
d
maybe
its
the
best
of
three
evils
maybe
not
but
overall
the
lack
of
taste
certainly
isnt
a
great
characteristic
appearance
really
like
piss
do
you
know
what
coors
light
and
sex
in
a
canoe
have
in
common
they
are
both
fking
near
water
this
is
a
good
beer
for
people
who
dont
drink
beer
an
alterative
to
water
on
a
hot
day
but
only
if
served
ice
cold
my
wife
used
to
drink
this
before
she
developed
an
appreciation
real
beer
d
no
thank
you
my
dad
always
talks
about
how
coors
was
the
shit
back
in
the
70s
when
it
was
only
distributed
west
of
the
mississippi
back
then
his
buddies
used
to
come
back
from
mizourahwith
this
thenunobtanium
and
marvel
at
how
inferior
it
was
to
the
swill
that
was
readily
available
to
those
fortunate
enough
to
live
smack
dab
between
the
shitbeer
meccas
of
st
louis
and
milwaukee
compared
to
the
other
major
us
brands
this
is
probably
by
fav
not
saying
a
lot
though
in
colorado
its
actually
slighty
better
d
not
that
bad
but
i
would
much
rather
drink
something
else
luckly
this
was
free
for
me
as
i
got
it
out
of
an
evicted
apt
sletchy
obviously
a
straw
yellow
almost
like
bud
light
but
even
more
watered
down
fizzy
head
recedes
right
away
no
lacing
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
comparing
it
to
a
bud
light
but
even
more
watered
down
with
slight
amount
of
citrus
on
the
nose
and
tongue
t
slight
sour
taste
that
made
me
a
little
queasy
why
drink
beer
this
site
says
respect
beer
im
sorry
but
this
is
not
beer
it
has
no
taste
no
flavor
ust
watered
down
seriously
becks
nonalcoholic
is
better
than
this
back
in
the
60s
we
called
coors
beer
rocky
mountain
coolaid
what
would
we
have
called
watered
down
coolaid
this
beer
is
watery
and
not
much
else
good
can
be
said
about
it
others
have
said
it
better
than
i
can
mouthfeel
is
weak
taste
is
atrocious
and
poured
appearance
is
without
obvious
merit
drinkability
would
be
adequate
for
the
nondiscrimiinatory
palate
but
would
not
satisfy
the
more
erudite
person
cheers
i
was
raised
on
american
macros
and
learned
to
love
the
flavor
of
schlitzpbrmiller
and
old
milwaukee
enough
to
choose
beer
as
my
drink
of
choice
i
moved
on
to
finer
beer
and
always
disliked
the
idea
of
light
beer
but
on
a
hot
day
or
if
the
idea
is
to
get
buzzed
why
not
suck
down
some
light
beers
to
do
the
trick
well
this
is
why
coors
light
is
piss
yellow
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
the
taste
is
watery
when
ice
cold
grainy
and
sour
when
warm
and
undrinkable
when
warmer
than
room
temperature
i
am
convinced
that
no
hops
exist
in
this
beer
cold
creamed
corn
and
a
stalk
of
barley
maybe
beer
for
those
who
dont
like
beer
that
is
a
bad
thing
beer
should
be
enjoed
and
not
tollerated
i
have
a
good
friend
who
drinks
this
and
i
give
him
shit
all
the
time
life
is
too
short
to
waste
time
and
money
on
what
is
not
enjoyable
at
least
grab
a
bud
or
pbr
better
yet
just
quit
dinking
beer
if
this
is
what
you
must
drink
i
would
rather
have
a
cup
of
coffee
or
tea
this
beer
has
its
place
though
it
belongs
in
sticky
dingy
frathouse
basements
coolers
at
the
beach
and
everywhere
else
craft
beer
isnt
and
likely
wont
be
appreciated
not
the
worst
light
beer
as
it
could
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
this
would
be
the
beer
i
think
non
beer
drinkers
should
like
this
as
opposed
to
bud
light
as
this
has
litte
to
no
off
flavor
oh
coors
light
the
beer
that
made
up
90
of
my
drinking
freshman
year
of
college
i
managed
to
pretty
much
avoid
it
all
of
my
sophomore
year
as
i
had
discovered
killians
irish
red
and
blue
moon
this
beer
is
really
only
good
for
drinking
games
i
avoid
it
as
much
as
possible
tastes
pretty
much
like
water
out
of
the
3
major
macro
light
lagers
my
favorites
are
coors
and
miller
light
neck
and
neck
then
bud
light
last
non
of
these
beers
have
real
flavor
profiles
these
kinds
of
beer
are
advertised
for
their
drinkabilty
and
how
refreshing
they
are
and
coors
light
is
no
exception
coors
light
claims
to
be
the
most
refreshing
beer
in
the
world
but
i
cant
pan
it
its
a
cheap
american
light
lager
you
get
exactly
what
you
expect
as
far
as
they
go
it
lasts
a
long
time
but
this
one

very

quite

not

of

that
its

drink
it

the
silver
bullet
is
coors
number
one
brand
because
im
guessing
the
incessant
advertising
during
sporting
events
is
the
key
if
you
want
a
beer
without
that
beer
taste
choked
down
half
of
a
third
one
another
mainstream
party
beer
that
ruins
the
perception

a
good
light
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
it
has
some
flavor
as
opposed
to
bud
light
which
america
seems
to
be
in
love
with
for
some
reason
light
beer
is
not
my
choice
of
beer
but
if
im
at
a
party
or
sitting
around
with
a
group
of
friends
this
is
usually
what
we
buy
and
its
not
bad
at
all
this
beer
was
not
created
to
be
awesome
like
newcastle
but
it
is
supposed
to
be
easy
to
drink
so
i
dont
think
it
deserves
all
the
low
ratings
and
you
can
slam
about
a
hundred
of
these
without
feeling
full
d
easy
to
put
down
and
this
is
a
college
party
beer
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
a
coors
light
in
a
year
and
half
d
typical
macro
brew
it
has
its
time
and
place
but
its
not
for
me
drinkability
is
similar
to
water
with
a
few
bubbles
and
alcohol
this
was
offered
to
me
by
my
friend
yesterday
ive
had
coors
light
numerous
times
in
all
forms
i
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
there
is
something
odd
with
the
taste
that
i
have
always
disliked
aroma
is
of
weak
malts
and
corn
appearance
is
pale
light
yellow
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
and
the
flavor
is
simply
not
good
this
is
likely
my
least
favorite
of
major
light
beers
will
not
spend
my
money
on
this
but
will
drink
it
if
its
my
only
option
d
for
what
is
was
a
light
macro
i
would
have
to
say
borderline
acceptable
though
i
doubt
i
could
down
these
in
multiples
despite
its
light
nature
i
would
suggest
you
down
these
quick
before
warming
d
its
a
light
beer
either
you
wanna
drink
it
or
you
dont
and
i
dont
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
slight
hint
of
cereal
grains
taste
was
cereal
grains
and
a
slight
hint
of
hops
but
overall
not
much
flavor
it
did
have
a
refreshing
taste
to
it
like
water
on
a
hot
day
mouthfeel
was
watery
i
could
sit
and
drink
these
all
day
especially
when
it
is
hot
but
it
goes
for
a
quick
buzz
not
much
else
d
drinks
like
water
with
some
carbonation
beer
is
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
raised
the
pour
height
to
try
to
create
some
head
and
got
a
quarter
of
an
inch
which
lasted
about
a
minute
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
hint
of
corn
grain
sweetness
in
the
nose
and
taste
of
this
beer
and
not
much
else
beer
feels
light
and
thin
in
my
mouth
with
some
carbonation
overall
the
only
time
i
would
prefer
this
beer
is
if
my
only
serving
glass
were
a
beer
bong
other
than
that
the
cold
activated
mountain
on
the
front
of
the
bottle
that
turns
blue
when
it
is
cold
is
the
best
thing
about
this
macro
lager
drinkability
biggest
attribute
of
this
beer
very
drinkable
just
not
drinking
mush
of
anything
the
beer
is
an
insipid
yellow
color
with
a
head
that
disappears
in
seconds
it
had
a
corn
malt
aroma
and
taste
a
thoroughly
unrewarding
beer
i
should
have
just
drunk
water
overall
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
any
time
soon
for
some
reason
i
seem
to
find
this
at
barbecues
and
various
functions
myself
and
my
family
go
to
and
its
also
the
only
beer
a
musician
friend
i
play
with
drinks
so
i
run
into
it
a
lot
not
sure
why
other
than
its
always
on
special
at
the
supermarket
i
find
this
to
taste
okay
ice
cold
but
so
do
pabst
blue
ribbon
and
miller
high
life
but
without
the
gnarly
aftertaste
that
seems
to
go
with
coors
and
bud
product
my
wife
tasted
this
on
my
breath
after
a
kiss
and
remarked
cheap
beer
not
exactly
a
ringing
endorsement
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
id
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
it
up
d
good
enough
for
when
everything
else
besides
bud
light
is
gone
otherwise
to
be
consumed
only
under
unduly
limited
circumstances
i
drink
this
stuff
if
it
is
all
that
is
left
i
never
ever
buy
it
only
chance
i
would
buy
it
would
be
if
i
was
throwing
a
party
and
a
very
very
good
friend
requested
it
and
she
was
extreamly
sexy
it
is
kind
of
like
a
flavored
water
a
good
thirst
quencher
goes
down
real
easy
drinkability
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
i
would
have
another
if
it
were
a
super
hot
day
and
i
was
at
the
beach
or
if
i
were
at
a
frat
party
otherwise
skip
it
i
dont
seek
this
out
but
if
its
all
thats
available
ill
drink
it
instead
of
going
without
only
drink
this
beer
for
one
reason
to
get
heavily
intoxicated
i
dont
care
if
its
rocky
mountain
water
or
not
only
good
for
one
reason
still
one
more
reason
than
some
beers
out
there
in
other
words
if
you
are
in
college
and
or
just
turned
21
try
it
and
have
fun
with
it
but
dont
just
drink
this
beer
explore
the
world
of
beer
hey
its
cheap
wet
and
fizzes
what
else
do
you
want
to
go
with
tencent
garlic
wings
mouthfeel
was
quite
refreshing
or
was
it
the
company
and
i
drank
3
of
the
subject
brews
before
running
like
hell
d
hardly
any
flavor
not
filling
at
all
i
also
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
theres
4
20
abv
in
this
beer
those
characteristics
make
it
a
good
representation
of
style
its
your
typical
fizzy
yellow
beer
looking
to
save
a
few
ill
get
high
life
in
cans
drinkability
is
great
you
can
drink
on
these
all
day
long
as
i
have
many
times
many
many
times
overall
i
will
not
purchaseorder
this
beer
voluntarily
the
only
reason
that
i
drank
it
was
because
it
was
the
only
beer
at
the
family
function
and
they
didnt
have
whisky
this
beer
really
took
me
away
to
the
rocky
mountains
coors
light
is
a
beer
that
only
been
and
beautiful
women
drink
having
it
cold
and
crisp
brew
really
took
me
to
another
level
of
enjoyment
i
almost
cried
as
the
frosty
crisp
mountain
refreshness
make
love
to
my
throat
thank
you
god
for
coors
light
i
love
this
beer
for
what
it
is
it
is
the
only
macrobrew
that
i
have
ever
and
will
ever
repeatedly
purchase
i
usually
drink
it
straight
from
the
can
but
i
once
poured
it
into
a
chalice
and
it
was
a
little
better
no
overpowering
scent
but
i
got
a
decent
head
on
it
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
drink
it
has
a
grainy
aftertaste
that
i
like
and
the
alcohol
does
not
overpower
your
tongue
like
it
does
in
some
other
lowertier
beers
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
best
of
the
light
beers
and
macrobreweries
a
crappy
bear
overall
tastes
like
metal
was
mixed
in
beer
flavor
comes
off
as
metalic
and
hardly
any
beer
flavor
drank
out
of
a
can
probably
had
something
to
do
with
the
overall
beer
taste
would
only
drink
if
given
to
me
free
even
then
would
probably
just
drink
water
md
thin
light
and
clean
i
find
it
refreshing
when
it
is
ice
cold
and
i
am
hot
as
hell
my
preference
out
of
the
three
mainstream
light
lagers
this
has
been
a
staple
yellow
beer
for
me
for
a
couple
of
years
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
tastes
best
out
of
a
can
you
can
drink
these
all
night
i
am
shifting
away
from
the
yellow
beers
i
think
jason
and
todd
sum
this
up
well
with
why
bother
most
light
beers
are
very
similar
so
if
you
want
one
buy
whatever
is
cheapest
this
stuff
is
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
of
grains
stale
yeast
and
old
hops
the
taste
is
unmemorable
very
light
if
thats
what
you
are
after
the
body
is
light
and
fizzy
not
very
drinkable
in
my
book
my
grandpa
still
refuses
to
acknowledge
that
there
are
other
beers
brewed
besides
bud
and
coorsbut
i
love
him
anyway
i
just
do
not
love
this
beer
l
i
acquired
an
extra
can
of
this
so
i
decided
to
review
it
as
unobjectionable
as
possible
12oz
vented
wide
mouth
can
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
pretty
nonexistent
with
faint
grainy
malt
the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
pretty
bland
with
a
faint
grain
flavors
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
prickly
from
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
low
abv
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
want
to
consume
much
in
one
sitting
due
to
getting
bored
overall
a
pretty
subpar
american
macro
light
lager
there
is
just
no
reason
to
pay
for
this
tap
water
is
freecheaper
in
most
cities
this
is
a
between
a
great
beer
beer
one
to
cleanse
your
pallet
and
keep
your
buzz
when
you
cant
find
a
bottle
of
water
i
could
drink
this
when
ive
got
important
tasks
to
do
like
light
engine
work
or
pulmonary
surgery
d
still
after
all
this
time
i
can
still
drink
it
but
its
not
the
same
im
actually
a
bit
surprised
but
then
again
i
used
to
drink
wild
irish
rose
too
very
dinkable
light
beer
pours
light
yellow
in
color
very
nice
head
with
a
crisp
taste
the
kinda
beer
you
can
drink
doing
yard
work
or
sittting
around
by
the
pool
with
freinds
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
light
beers
flows
smooth
and
easy
wake
up
the
next
day
with
a
smile
even
after
many
hang
over
free
not
much
taste
a
very
watery
beer
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
pours
a
light
yellow
little
head
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
doing
yardgarden
work
a
thoroughly
unimpressive
beer
not
as
bad
as
the
corona
light
i
reviewed
the
other
day
but
its
probably
one
you
should
stay
away
from
the
golden
color
is
pale
because
of
the
extra
watery
taste
the
foamy
head
is
too
aggressive
the
smell
reminds
me
of
wet
grains
and
tastes
limp
id
have
to
say
this
is
the
worst
of
the
lights
version
of
bmc
i
used
to
be
a
coors
fan
a
decade
ago
its
sad
to
see
how
far
theyve
fallen
drinkability
beer
without
any
character
in
the
style
light
lager
i
guess
if
your
roving
drunken
college
parties
its
acceptable
but
otherwise
ill
pass
i
swear
it
was
free
did
not
pay
money
for
this
pours
a
nice
14
inch
head
that
falls
fast
into
almost
no
head
and
absolutely
no
lacing
the
color
is
slightly
yellow
but
looks
like
water
with
a
tiny
amount
of
iodine
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
a
slight
scent
of
grain
not
a
lot
of
aroma
a
small
lager
flavor
hits
the
tongue
and
leaves
right
away
with
a
small
nose
of
the
same
lager
flavor
with
a
hint
of
corn
mouthfeel
is
like
a
light
soda
pop
with
a
strong
acidic
bite
overall
this
is
something
i
could
never
get
used
to
and
drink
on
a
regular
basis
drink
ability
is
pretty
debatable
it
would
be
easy
to
down
a
half
dozen
if
these
but
the
taste
sort
of
makes
me
long
for
something
far
better
d
typical
college
beer
drank
this
before
i
knew
what
beer
was
d
i
would
have
to
say
this
stuff
is
very
drinkable
not
that
you
would
want
to
drink
much
of
it
but
you
could
easily
session
it
if
you
were
stranded
on
an
island
and
a
crate
of
it
washed
up
d
ummm
no
i
could
drink
one
if
i
reaaaally
didnt
want
to
offend
the
person
who
handed
it
to
me
glad
to
hear
that
it
is
only
105
calories
makes
me
feel
better
about
my
college
life
aroma
is
skunk
and
corn
with
a
tad
bit
of
cereal
and
grass
appearence
is
light
yellow
slightly
dehydrated
urine
with
extra
bubbles
and
no
head
whatsoever
it
gets
points
in
the
taste
department
for
well
the
lack
of
taste
cause
trust
me
it
could
be
much
worse
it
is
better
that
this
beer
has
absolutely
no
taste
at
all
very
dry
and
overcarbonated
so
far
this
is
the
king
of
the
sub
2
0
beers
largely
thanks
to
its
lack
of
any
taste
smells
of
adjuncts
rice
faint
grain
odor
taste
is
of
very
faint
maltiness
next
to
nothing
in
hops
and
an
off
taste
in
the
finish
extremely
watery
with
crazy
carbonation
like
a
coca
cola
if
you
arent
looking
to
enjoy
your
brew
and
want
to
slam
20
of
these
out
partying
then
i
guess
they
would
be
drinkable
draft
at
chilis
in
sacramento
no
head
and
basically
no
smell
either
nothing
bad
but
just
very
bland
taste
is
the
same
probably
the
lightest
flavor
of
all
the
light
beers
ive
had
and
maybe
why
its
drinkable
refreshing
when
cold
for
sure
and
no
offensive
flavors
but
it
basically
tastes
like
water
there
are
definitey
worse
good
beers
out
there
that
id
pick
this
over
actually
the
only
good
thing
i
can
really
say
about
this
beer
is
that
im
almost
finished
with
it
almost
no
head
very
pale
yelow
in
color
smell
was
a
touch
of
corn
and
almost
no
hop
aroma
taste
i
never
thought
a
beer
could
have
so
little
flavor
as
this
mouthfeel
if
it
wasnt
for
carbonation
it
would
have
none
avoid
this
one
if
at
all
possible
d
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
preferrable
as
about
every
other
beer
it
is
the
bmc
light
beer
that
i
drink
the
most
often
drinkability
is
quasi
decent
when
you
eating
a
big
plate
of
wings
with
your
buds
or
if
at
the
beach
and
its
early
start
the
day
off
light
and
easy
with
a
coors
light
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
this
is
a
bright
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
a
barely
noticeable
hop
smell
is
apparent
and
quite
frankly
reminds
me
of
a
frat
house
after
a
sleezy
party
there
is
a
soursweet
smell
and
taste
that
is
associated
with
cheap
domestic
beers
a
slight
malty
taste
is
there
but
the
adjuncts
are
definitely
what
is
most
prevalent
there
is
a
minimal
hop
flavor
that
is
really
a
waste
of
time
if
youre
not
going
to
go
for
it
why
bother
the
head
surprisingly
lingers
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
down
the
glass
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
watery
thin
mouthfeel
give
you
what
you
would
expect
out
of
this
beer
drinkability
you
may
as
well
drink
water
or
pis
but
it
does
have
a
label
that
changes
color
drinkability
it
is
alright
but
nothing
i
am
hoping
to
go
back
to
anytime
soon
it
tasted
fresh
and
was
good
and
cold
that
is
the
only
reason
i
gave
it
the
marks
i
did
really
boring
but
this
is
session
beer
drink
a
bunch
and
party
on
drinkabilty
there
is
better
stuff
to
drink
but
i
see
why
i
liked
this
over
bud
in
my
preba
days
not
a
american
macro
its
a
lager
well
im
getting
off
the
silver
bullet
now
this
product
is
the
cornerstone
of
what
advertising
can
do
for
sales
ok
fine
i
had
my
fun
its
american
macro
how
are
you
supposed
to
respect
a
beer
like
this
if
the
company
that
produces
it
respects
neither
the
beer
or
the
consumer
drink
this
for
what
it
is
d
a
bit
better
than
the
bud
light
i
just
drank
but
still
fucking
terrible
i
like
coors
but
coors
light
is
the
pits
i
only
did
half
the
bottle
at
my
friend
pards
house
then
poured
the
shite
down
the
sink
at
least
it
was
free
thanks
for
the
bunk
beer
repard
thats
not
beer
thats
coors
youve
got
to
be
kidding
the
rocky
mountain
freshness
must
still
be
in
the
outside
air
because
the
can
is
full
of
a
yellow
liquid
that
has
been
falsely
advertised
as
beer
golden
co
has
nothing
on
rehoboth
de
and
the
dogfish
head
brewery
ah
the
silver
bullet
their
slogan
should
be
more
like
hey
at
least
its
not
bud
light
coors
is
a
good
beer
to
chug
and
you
have
to
chug
a
lot
to
get
drunk
off
the
stuff
im
not
a
fan
of
light
beer
but
if
im
going
to
drink
a
cheap
light
beer
its
gonna
be
this
stuff
the
best
thing
about
coors
is
their
frost
brewed
liner
which
i
think
really
makes
a
difference
you
dont
get
as
much
of
that
metallic
taste
as
with
other
canned
beers
chugged
this
out
of
a
can
on
the
way
to
a
jimmy
buffett
concert
thats
why
it
got
the
2
for
drinkability
otherwise
its
the
same
as
all
the
light
macros
a
little
sweet
which
is
alright
and
gives
it
a
1
5
for
taste
instead
of
a
1
weve
all
had
one
its
ok
pours
a
pale
straw
with
a
thin
head
smells
of
faint
malt
and
hops
taste
is
thin
and
watery
typical
of
an
american
macro
better
than
some
macros
but
still
not
all
that
good
stay
away
but
amongst
miller
bud
and
coors
light
id
go
with
coors
just
because
it
had
better
marketing
when
i
was
younger
light
bodied
has
a
bit
of
grainyness
best
when
cold
a
beer
to
pound
not
to
sip
and
let
get
warm
best
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
coors
light
was
a
very
pale
golden
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
white
head
that
disappeared
almost
instantly
the
aroma
was
very
clean
with
a
hint
of
sweet
grain
the
taste
was
very
light
with
a
little
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
watery
even
for
a
light
beer
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
below
average
this
has
got
to
be
about
the
most
watered
down
beer
i
have
ever
tried
not
recommended
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
then
bitingly
stale
i
can
see
why
coors
lays
it
on
so
thick
with
the
ice
cold
business
if
this
is
even
slightly
above
said
condition
then
its
totally
unpalatable
worst
beer
ive
ever
tried
wo
a
doubt
the
most
overhyped
beer
the
one
regaling
factor
for
this
beer
is
if
youre
trying
to
not
pack
on
carbs
then
again
you
might
as
well
drink
soda
because
on
one
occasion
i
killed
a
12pack
of
this
cans
and
didnt
even
have
to
urinate
w
so
many
light
beers
to
choose
from
this
is
a
skip
only
coors
massive
ad
campaign
for
it
is
why
were
even
talking
about
it
now
average
even
for
a
macro
lager
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
with
no
lacing
but
nice
head
has
a
slightly
sourskunky
smell
to
it
decent
malt
taste
but
nothing
great
a
little
on
the
sour
side
goes
down
fine
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
average
overall
for
a
macro
compared
to
just
about
anything
else
it
would
be
even
worse
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
tonic
water
thin
and
watery
i
suppose
there
is
a
decently
crisp
and
refreshing
finish
that
is
better
then
many
other
macros
but
aside
from
that
i
would
say
skip
it
unless
youre
looking
to
play
some
drinking
games
steer
clear
and
i
swear
if
a
giant
frosty
silver
train
comes
busting
through
my
house
again
im
going
to
have
some
issues
this
beer
pours
a
pale
pissy
yellow
with
virtualy
no
head
smells
like
any
other
macro
light
beer
and
it
tastes
pretty
awful
at
first
but
then
it
gets
alot
better
it
starts
our
very
water
and
leaves
an
awful
aftertaste
but
if
youve
drank
some
decent
brew
prior
to
drinking
the
coors
it
tastes
like
water
which
isnt
a
good
tihng
it
just
makes
it
really
easy
to
get
smashed
a
great
party
beer
if
your
looking
to
drink
to
get
drunk
becuase
its
light
and
doesnt
feel
you
up
and
leave
you
bloated
it
just
tastes
crisp
and
clean
def
cheap
macro
but
better
than
bud
or
miller
so
yeah
id
drink
it
again
coors
is
just
an
average
beer
i
believe
it
is
better
than
miller
light
and
bud
light
plus
i
like
the
fact
that
it
is
not
union
and
i
did
work
in
a
union
so
do
not
say
i
am
biased
this
is
just
an
average
beer
but
better
than
the
other
macros
but
soon
to
be
with
a
macro
miller
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
great
lite
beers
out
there
on
the
market
today
certainly
a
session
beer
where
the
low
alcohol
percentage
and
few
calories
lets
you
drink
up
without
feeling
too
full
or
bloated
i
prefer
it
out
of
the
bottle
whenever
i
get
it
on
tap
it
seems
very
watereddown
and
bland
tastewise
ive
tried
better
lite
beers
but
this
is
certainly
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
it
is
a
definite
classic
and
can
be
enjoyed
with
just
about
any
foodpairing
especially
good
to
be
enjoyed
with
appetizers
the
40
oz
bottle
fit
entirely
into
my
spaten
oktoberfest
mug
an
insult
to
spaten
yes
appearance
is
terrible
very
pale
yellowish
gold
virtually
no
head
smells
like
cheap
macro
cornricehayearth
tastes
watery
and
cheap
feels
watery
this
shits
no
better
than
milwaukees
best
light
but
at
least
milwaukees
best
light
has
the
decency
to
charge
a
fair
price
marketing
promotes
this
beer
as
a
premium
brew
thats
derived
from
the
snowycold
mountains
of
colorado
etc
it
is
not
easy
to
drink
however
as
is
water
d
drinkable
if
you
want
to
drink
a
case
or
2
in
a
night
but
otherwise
terrible
beer
when
youre
looking
to
this
style
id
go
with
miller
light
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
bought
me
one
at
a
ball
game
im
honestly
not
convinced
coors
light
is
any
better
than
keystone
coors
cheaper
version
of
this
brew
coors
light
is
what
it
is
the
one
thing
that
bothers
me
about
this
website
is
that
people
continually
tear
down
the
big
companies
as
awful
beer
the
beer
is
obviously
nowhere
near
as
good
as
a
27
belgian
but
it
is
what
it
is
that
being
said
compared
to
drinks
like
miller
lite
coors
light
really
isnt
very
good
like
bud
light
it
has
very
very
very
little
taste
but
is
perfect
for
mass
consumption
basically
these
beers
are
made
for
mass
comsumption
and
they
are
perfect
for
it
if
you
want
taste
out
of
any
of
the
big
brand
beers
miller
lite
is
by
far
and
away
the
best
option
crackly
thin
watery
very
light
and
easy
for
those
who
like
to
drink
water
not
too
much
taste
very
incoherent
would
go
good
with
shrimp
oysters
and
other
easy
seafood
since
it
would
not
burden
the
food
good
for
a
hot
sunny
day
at
the
track
car
racing
horse
racing
etc
but
for
a
beer
advocate
nothing
at
all
another
typical
american
light
beer
a
very
light
golden
color
that
gives
of
a
faint
smell
of
sweet
malt
and
corn
as
close
to
water
as
you
can
get
in
a
beer
outside
of
michelob
ultra
its
sweet
but
that
grainy
corn
flavor
is
definitely
present
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
soda
crisp
and
somewhat
refreshing
its
easy
to
drink
but
why
bother
decent
smell
for
this
style
of
beer
appearance
is
fairly
weak
mouthfeel
is
average
for
the
style
taste
however
is
sub
par
the
head
is
a
kind
of
flavorless
foam
if
you
will
of
the
premium
branded
light
beers
this
is
probably
on
the
low
end
of
the
scale
i
would
recommend
going
with
miller
lite
instead
if
your
choices
are
limited
one
beer
that
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
very
opaque
in
appearance
the
aroma
is
very
weak
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
but
overall
very
weak
and
smells
of
most
other
cheap
beers
the
taste
is
not
much
different
very
weak
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
metal
and
mild
hops
the
nice
carbonation
really
helps
with
the
very
bland
flavor
it
gives
the
one
good
thing
is
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
alot
of
because
of
its
watery
flavor
as
for
the
american
macro
light
lager
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
but
that
really
is
not
saying
much
its
the
best
of
the
worst
d
fine
for
a
light
beer
its
tasteless
nature
makes
it
easy
to
drink
or
pound
but
not
something
i
would
order
regularly
editing
again
after
trying
a
bottle
it
just
got
so
boring
i
left
it
half
full
another
overhyped
macrobrew
no
substance
no
body
no
taste
another
beer
for
those
who
like
to
get
drunk
and
urinate
a
lot
but
really
do
not
enjoy
the
taste
of
beer
about
as
satisfying
as
carbonated
water
thank
god
there
are
brewers
out
there
that
care
about
the
quality
of
their
product
and
not
just
the
cleverness
of
their
commercials
this
taste
like
bad
water
with
an
even
stranger
taste
while
the
water
in
it
may
be
mountain
pure
something
along
the
way
went
terribly
wrong
carbonation
is
the
only
thing
i
could
detect
from
coors
light
i
suppose
refreshing
is
the
only
thing
i
have
to
say
for
this
beer
though
thats
a
stretch
goes
down
like
water
and
tastes
about
the
same
theres
no
reason
for
me
to
have
this
again
by
the
way
this
was
the
canadian
versionmade
by
molsons
brewery
i
think
the
u
s
one
is
even
weaker
could
drink
about
thirty
of
these
if
somebody
wanted
to
super
super
light
beer
ok
im
not
going
to
b
s
youits
not
a
beer
rich
in
flavor
nor
does
it
have
great
head
but
by
no
means
is
it
disgusting
it
is
what
it
is
a
light
macro
beer
its
not
something
you
will
go
out
of
your
way
to
buy
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
tastes
real
good
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
head
that
fades
immediately
aroma
is
very
slightly
sweet
grainy
but
thats
it
taste
is
watery
dry
and
grainy
there
is
an
elusive
hint
of
malt
flavor
but
its
very
faint
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
i
know
better
than
to
let
this
one
warm
up
as
ive
nursed
a
few
2
bottles
at
wing
night
its
drinkable
until
it
warms
up
macros
certainly
have
their
time
and
place
but
im
still
not
a
big
fan
of
the
light
variety
final
statement
coors
light
wins
this
is
a
non
beer
drinkers
beer
its
definately
not
offensive
because
there
is
no
flavour
i
cant
say
its
bad
but
its
definately
not
really
beer
i
drank
this
beer
one
day
during
a
nascar
race
and
it
really
had
me
questioning
if
i
was
drinking
beer
or
water
there
was
no
distinct
smell
or
taste
associated
with
this
beer
i
never
really
felt
like
i
had
a
beer
in
my
mouth
it
was
very
watery
with
little
carbination
after
drinking
7
or
8
of
these
i
didnt
really
feel
like
i
had
any
beers
in
me
at
all
so
i
would
have
to
say
they
change
the
name
from
coors
light
to
water
becuase
thats
about
all
your
drinking
with
this
stuff
comment
when
the
choice
is
beer
or
no
beer
this
is
still
a
beer
d
i
fortunately
have
the
last
half
of
a
southern
tier
unearthly
to
make
me
forget
the
taste
of
this
swill
i
honestly
cant
imagine
any
situation
where
id
find
this
drinkable
no
redeeming
qualities
at
all
its
not
too
rough
going
down
but
if
your
aim
is
to
get
drunk
then
this
beer
has
a
place
in
the
beer
bong
dont
torture
yourself
by
drinking
one
at
a
time
how
this
is
the
light
version
of
the
original
is
beyond
me
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
because
of
how
weak
it
is
and
how
it
has
no
real
flavour
but
would
i
want
to
if
the
makers
of
this
beer
wanted
a
drink
people
could
drink
all
day
w
out
feeling
the
effects
of
the
alcohol
or
a
drink
that
has
no
flavour
to
more
traditional
drinks
they
did
a
damn
good
job
overall
seriously
why
bother
im
not
just
being
mean
if
your
just
trying
to
get
hammered
drink
a
few
shots
or
something
maybe
drink
one
of
those
flavored
malt
beverages
at
least
it
has
some
flavor
pours
out
light
gold
with
decent
head
and
very
heavy
signs
of
carbonation
smells
very
light
with
some
hint
of
hops
almost
no
taste
except
for
the
bitter
alcohol
that
may
follow
but
for
the
most
part
very
watery
it
is
however
quite
refreshing
because
of
its
lack
of
flavor
and
the
fact
that
its
so
light
its
drinkability
is
quite
high
overall
refreshing
but
not
a
beerlovers
beer
not
the
best
light
beer
but
not
the
worst
drinkability
sure
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
beach
but
would
i
enjoy
it
probably
not
facing
a
fridge
of
macros
from
around
the
world
i
committed
myself
to
facing
off
the
big
3
american
light
macros
only
two
beers
in
im
struggling
to
tell
them
apart
coors
has
better
products
though
hops
where
was
it
i
understand
what
is
trying
to
be
acheived
by
this
beer
it
just
taht
there
is
a
little
too
much
taste
missing
i
feel
like
this
beer
retains
a
very
watery
feel
and
taste
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tang
after
one
or
two
i
almost
want
to
say
that
if
the
flavor
that
is
hard
to
find
in
this
beer
was
increased
by
46
it
might
be
another
story
looks
ok
smells
not
ok
tastes
not
there
bottled
water
was
2
a
bottle
this
was
3
a
can
if
its
hot
and
theres
a
party
atmosphere
im
going
for
a
beer
even
one
as
bland
as
tasteless
as
this
one
session
beer
but
there
are
far
better
session
beers
out
there
with
similar
price
and
availability
not
recommended
you
know
when
a
beer
is
unimpressive
its
unimpressive
period
my
mom
told
me
that
when
this
beer
wasnt
available
everywhere
they
would
have
people
bring
it
back
from
vacations
in
colorado
why
pours
with
very
little
head
no
retention
as
expected
not
to
much
on
the
nose
smells
like
a
macro
should
slightly
malty
nothing
intresting
here
taste
is
very
bland
and
watery
i
am
glad
i
never
drank
stuff
like
this
but
they
sure
know
how
to
market
and
sell
there
beer
drinkability
not
much
taste
to
it
as
most
light
beers
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
in
the
bigbeer
light
category
this
is
my
second
favorite
light
one
big
plus
with
coors
is
the
noadditives
factor
adolph
coors
was
a
bit
of
a
nut
in
regards
to
chemical
atleration
of
his
product
if
you
are
seeking
an
inoffensive
light
beer
with
the
least
amount
of
engineering
this
is
it
a
good
medium
taste
for
an
american
light
lager
an
allday
drink
a
very
fine
light
beer
it
is
what
it
is
and
for
the
style
a
very
acceptable
beer
that
taste
is
gone
maybe
it
is
the
so
called
frost
brew
liner
it
is
still
a
tasteless
excuse
for
a
beer
but
at
least
for
me
in
the
can
it
is
now
a
drinkable
one
cant
speak
for
pbr
it
hasnt
been
available
around
my
parts
for
a
while
drinkability
if
there
is
nothing
else
heck
yeah
go
for
it
you
can
have
a
gazillion
of
these
and
barely
feel
as
if
you
drank
anything
as
it
turns
out
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
play
beerpong
with
this
is
an
example
of
where
good
things
go
wrong
and
where
people
with
lots
of
money
and
psychotic
political
affiliations
can
really
do
some
crappy
stuff
i
mean
really
id
be
hard
pressed
to
be
convinced
that
they
buy
nothing
but
the
best
mass
quantity
adjuncts
for
this
not
being
sold
on
the
spot
market
theres
got
to
be
some
sort
of
good
quality
to
this
but
i
have
no
idea
what
itd
be
this
is
my
favourite
light
beer
although
that
isnt
saying
much
as
i
dont
like
light
beer
in
general
the
silver
bullet
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
little
or
no
head
what
aroma
there
is
is
very
weak
in
nature
making
it
difficult
to
classify
the
taste
is
beerlike
witrh
a
weak
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
some
hints
of
carbonation
if
you
absolutely
have
to
get
a
light
macro
beer
make
it
this
one
the
can
states
its
crisp
and
refreshing
wheres
the
crispness
well
at
least
there
were
no
major
offflavors
but
it
was
still
beer
diluted
with
water
coors
light
has
about
30
fewer
calories
as
the
original
and
now
i
know
why
i
couldnt
finish
the
last
30
of
this
appearance
is
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
goes
away
theres
just
nothing
in
the
smell
even
the
smell
can
be
pale
to
much
water
in
this
beer
it
cuts
the
flavor
taste
like
water
a
lot
i
do
not
recomend
this
beer
to
anyone
if
you
want
to
have
macro
lager
this
is
not
the
one
this
is
what
i
used
to
drink
before
i
lived
in
germany
and
got
to
know
better
as
with
all
american
macrobrews
this
is
way
overfiltered
and
thus
all
possible
character
is
lost
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
is
it
goes
down
easy
just
like
water
unfortunately
i
like
a
lot
more
complexity
in
my
beer
than
my
water
and
this
has
none
its
only
redeeming
quality
is
how
inexpensive
it
can
be
purchased
from
almost
anywhere
coors
light
is
what
it
is
im
originally
from
colorado
so
it
has
to
be
my
go
to
macro
when
thats
all
there
is
ironically
it
is
really
good
to
wash
down
maryland
crabs
eating
crabs
is
an
event
in
this
state
youd
have
to
be
there
and
its
also
great
for
crabs
because
it
goes
down
so
easily
too
easily
in
fact
nice
pale
beer
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
nice
bubbles
on
the
glass
that
tingle
through
the
first
few
sips
incidentally
if
drunk
from
the
can
its
about
like
drinking
a
sprite
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
an
interestingeven
a
bit
addictingfruity
banana
hops
scent
and
taste
i
know
why
its
so
popular
it
leave
you
wanting
more
and
it
goes
down
so
easily
that
you
almost
forget
youre
drinking
beer
until
the
alcohol
hits
you
what
can
i
say
its
a
macro
an
american
light
macro
to
boot
but
easily
the
best
of
the
big
three
light
macros
out
there
as
if
that
meant
anything
heres
something
that
puts
coors
light
in
context
over
the
memorial
day
weekend
we
were
drinking
coors
light
while
waiting
for
the
real
beer
to
chill
in
the
ice
chest
kinda
says
it
all
coors
light
for
a
lite
beer
its
not
bad
it
is
a
suitable
palate
cleanser
between
real
beers
perhaps
better
that
bud
light
its
clean
with
no
hop
or
malt
taste
all
you
really
taste
is
bubbles
and
a
little
spicy
note
lawnmower
beer
admit
it
though
most
of
us
grew
up
on
this
stuff
before
we
awoke
to
the
world
of
real
beer
this
beer
sucks
as
far
as
most
people
on
this
sight
are
concerned
no
one
is
going
to
read
this
review
so
i
wont
waist
my
time
going
into
detail
on
it
but
this
beer
does
serve
a
purpose
slamming
c
on
the
beach
is
quite
nice
and
makes
the
fresman
15
nonexistant
so
everyone
knows
we
here
on
ba
arent
supposed
to
like
coors
light
but
dammit
everytime
i
drink
this
stuff
i
get
laid
so
i
cant
totally
bash
it
as
long
as
im
shotgunning
or
beerbonging
this
stuff
it
really
isnt
horrible
drinkablity
is
good
should
be
a
fun
evening
not
drinkable
at
all
i
politely
refused
another
on
the
grounds
that
i
was
driving
coors
light
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
like
most
light
lagers
are
personally
it
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
macros
but
i
will
not
refuse
to
drink
it
d
refreshing
but
flavour
loses
it
points
d
there
really
is
no
reason
to
drink
this
beer
unless
if
youve
been
working
outside
all
day
in
the
blistering
sun
and
you
want
the
coldest
thing
possible
in
the
fridge
its
not
bad
if
you
just
want
to
replenish
your
body
with
water
but
then
why
not
just
drink
cold
water
drinkability
why
cant
people
spare
my
palate
by
purchasing
high
life
or
pbr
instead
of
crap
like
this
id
only
drink
this
if
i
wanted
to
improve
my
shotgunning
technique
without
wasting
any
good
beer
yet
another
beer
i
tried
at
a
party
only
because
it
was
available
and
i
was
curious
to
find
out
if
it
was
worth
my
time
appearance
is
typical
and
not
impressive
aroma
is
weak
and
wan
taste
seems
rather
watered
down
i
didnt
feel
as
if
i
was
drinking
beer
maybe
ive
been
spoiled
by
craft
brews
and
imports
my
relationship
with
coors
light
has
been
long
and
heartfelt
however
those
were
my
college
years
this
is
definetly
like
any
other
macrobrewed
beer
with
little
to
no
character
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
in
a
i
just
want
to
get
slammed
kind
of
way
drinkability
not
a
super
filling
beer
medium
in
the
filling
range
overall
acceptable
for
those
huge
parties
when
most
people
arent
looking
for
taste
if
you
know
what
i
mean
but
personally
ill
give
the
nod
for
cheap
american
light
beer
to
bud
ooh
a
frost
brewed
can
god
this
is
as
bad
as
bud
light
your
ultimate
fizzy
light
yellow
flavorless
beer
i
honestly
cant
detect
any
malt
or
hop
character
whatsoever
great
job
with
the
adjuncts
and
force
carbonation
though
coors
like
bud
and
others
has
achieved
their
goal
of
a
completely
flavorless
characterless
beverage
hey
water
is
good
when
its
really
cold
if
you
need
alcohol
why
not
just
do
some
shots
of
cheap
vodka
man
those
are
some
hot
chicks
in
the
ads
too
this
is
only
a
bad
beer
if
you
slow
down
to
pay
attention
however
mindlessly
tipping
these
back
whilst
watching
the
game
is
extraordinarily
easy
drinkability
pretty
easily
drinkable
if
youre
just
looking
to
drink
a
large
amount
goes
down
easy
but
not
great
if
you
just
want
to
sit
around
and
sip
a
beer
comes
out
a
light
pee
yellow
with
a
fingers
worth
of
head
that
is
lost
in
seconds
smell
is
neutral
not
the
sulfery
notes
that
i
get
from
many
other
light
lagers
but
nothing
in
the
nose
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
corn
syruppy
no
hops
as
far
as
i
can
taste
goes
down
watery
and
tastes
like
water
drinkability
not
what
i
would
normally
order
but
just
hanging
out
with
some
friends
at
a
local
college
bar
it
certainly
hit
the
spot
overall
ill
drink
it
when
its
free
but
only
under
protest
one
of
my
least
favorite
macro
beers
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
but
it
does
not
taste
at
all
good
which
leaves
me
not
wanting
to
drink
anymore
overall
somewhat
typical
for
a
light
macro
not
good
light
golden
color
with
thin
white
head
that
fizzes
away
fast
smell
is
corn
syrup
and
rice
it
actually
has
some
flavor
but
its
overly
sweet
not
much
of
any
hop
presence
to
rescue
it
pretty
syrupy
sweet
for
such
a
light
beer
light
overly
sweet
malty
body
not
very
refreshing
for
a
light
lager
all
beer
snobbery
aside
this
is
still
my
goto
for
domestic
beer
when
out
at
a
club
that
doesnt
serve
good
beer
compared
to
the
other
big
boys
like
bud
light
miller
lite
et
al
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
for
all
categories
i
rate
it
3
0
average
because
thats
what
youll
get
from
coors
light
your
average
american
light
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
in
my
neverending
at
least
it
seems
that
way
quest
to
absorb
the
common
macros
i
have
yet
another
entry
poured
a
sort
of
pale
yellow
i
said
sort
of
as
it
was
almost
clear
big
fizzy
white
head
faded
instantly
leaving
a
light
yellow
liquid
filled
with
tons
of
visible
carbonation
crystal
clear
and
thin
smell
was
non
existentseeing
a
pattern
here
and
what
was
there
was
barely
a
bread
or
grain
smell
taste
was
refreshing
when
cold
putrid
when
warm
by
refreshing
i
mean
like
a
glass
of
water
when
your
hot
the
taste
was
non
existent
nothing
maybe
a
light
malt
but
overall
nothing
very
thin
mouthfeel
actually
felt
lighter
then
water
overall
i
could
see
why
people
would
drink
this
when
its
hot
in
the
desert
and
they
are
dying
of
thirst
but
to
drink
it
for
the
taste
or
enjoyement
i
would
pass
all
in
all
not
a
good
beer
and
i
would
not
recommend
to
anyone
what
a
waste
of
time
low
abv
and
no
flavor
i
guess
you
could
pound
50
or
so
of
these
in
a
day
but
why
i
love
beers
especially
imports
and
micros
i
stay
away
from
the
macros
if
possible
coors
light
is
beer
just
not
very
good
beer
i
just
hope
folks
would
get
a
little
creative
and
try
some
of
greater
beers
out
there
bottom
line
drinkable
but
mindless
had
on
tap
at
beef
obradys
though
i
have
had
several
times
before
typical
light
bodied
bmc
macro
beer
not
much
on
the
aroma
or
flavor
and
palate
is
thirstquenching
but
not
much
more
the
only
good
thing
about
this
is
that
at
1
50
a
pint
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
if
not
much
more
was
available
it
is
not
awful
and
i
am
also
not
impressed
i
drink
these
when
offered
by
others
and
wanting
to
be
social
or
on
an
extremely
hot
day
when
thirst
needs
quenching
d
even
though
this
beer
is
bad
i
remembered
it
as
being
somehow
a
lot
worse
its
a
standard
macrolager
that
pretty
much
tastes
like
water
or
donkey
piss
as
my
dad
always
said
overall
there
is
absolutely
no
point
to
this
beer
for
a
light
it
falls
short
in
taste
and
high
in
calories
i
compared
this
to
a
miller
light
in
the
same
sitting
coors
has
102
calories
while
miller
has
better
taste
at
96
calories
and
fewer
carbs
to
boot
id
probably
even
take
a
michelob
ultra
amber
over
this
pointless
diet
beer
avoid
drinkability
one
could
drink
many
of
these
if
he
did
not
desire
flavor
and
complexity
i
found
it
rather
tasteless
and
boring
d
yuck
i
cant
see
how
people
drink
this
shit
everyday
before
having
this
i
assumed
it
was
place
poorly
everwhere
but
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
anticipating
water
but
coorns
messed
it
up
and
actually
made
this
an
unpleasant
drinking
experience
rather
than
a
neutral
one
it
actually
has
a
substantial
amount
of
flavor
considering
that
it
is
a
light
beer
but
the
flavor
is
gross
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
ever
made
but
it
might
be
a
contender
if
there
is
ever
a
competition
for
that
title
drinkability
coors
lights
only
redeeming
trait
is
fantastic
on
that
blazing
summer
day
when
you
cant
find
any
genny
light
or
labatt
blue
light
poured
into
a
frozen
mug
out
of
my
kegorator
this
is
perhaps
the
most
colorless
beer
out
there
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
no
smell
what
so
ever
doesnt
taste
as
heavy
on
the
adjuncts
as
other
light
macros
though
there
is
that
artficial
sweetness
to
it
no
real
malt
or
hop
taste
to
it
the
drinkability
is
great
if
you
wish
to
drink
a
can
out
of
a
cooler
tailgating
during
the
summer
imo
with
all
lite
beers
drink
h2o
not
lite
beer
why
spend
money
on
swill
this
one
pours
a
very
light
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
has
no
retention
whatsoever
with
a
whispy
crown
in
the
end
the
carbonation
seems
to
dissapate
quickly
too
the
smell
is
rather
earthy
maybe
a
bit
of
corn
and
rotten
feet
the
taste
is
horrendous
very
watery
and
completely
bland
its
starts
with
a
hits
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
goes
flat
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
a
choke
to
swallow
does
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
like
thinned
out
cola
very
watery
and
not
filling
or
refreshing
sorry
campers
this
one
goes
down
the
drain
drinkability
undrinkable
drain
pour
this
is
the
reason
why
a
person
would
dislike
beer
if
you
want
to
drink
beer
with
less
calories
buy
a
better
beer
and
drink
less
of
it
tastes
like
rocky
mountain
feces
straight
from
the
sewers
of
golden
colorado
honestly
i
cant
believe
pete
coors
has
the
balls
to
get
on
tv
in
the
pristine
colorado
mountains
and
pretend
that
this
beer
has
anything
to
do
with
our
state
he
a
fraud
and
so
is
this
beer
drinkability
i
looked
down
and
was
almost
done
not
a
sipper
drinkability
whey
would
you
drink
this
crap
just
go
waste
your
money
on
the
other
macros
out
there
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
beer
that
will
go
down
easy
this
is
a
prime
choice
however
keep
in
mind
that
it
is
a
light
beer
and
therfore
some
of
its
qualities
are
lessened
appearance
is
a
somewhat
faded
amber
but
it
usually
pour
for
a
good
head
so
you
can
embrace
the
aroma
beer
smell
is
good
but
kind
of
malty
tastes
pretty
good
for
a
light
beer
but
it
doesnt
give
you
a
feeling
of
beer
in
your
mouth
kind
of
watery
i
do
like
it
though
as
a
light
beer
i
will
reach
for
it
when
available
if
its
the
darkest
there
ya
know
if
youre
drinking
this
for
quantity
you
might
as
well
go
with
keystone
light
i
really
cant
taste
much
of
a
difference
at
all
between
the
two
and
keystone
light
you
can
get
for
much
less
id
recommend
both
for
quantity
drinking
because
the
taste
is
so
smooth
you
can
easily
consume
mass
quantities
but
thats
the
only
time
i
reach
for
a
can
of
the
silver
bullet
drinkability
good
actually
good
for
beer
pong
not
good
to
sit
down
for
a
quality
drink
honestly
what
is
the
point
to
this
i
dont
know
why
light
beers
get
treated
this
way
but
lets
not
forget
the
positives
this
beer
serves
a
purpose
and
within
its
intended
role
it
performs
perfectly
well
but
here
on
ba
look
somewhere
else
fast
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
you
can
drink
about
100
and
still
be
able
to
walk
straight
it
is
very
very
light
and
very
very
easy
to
put
back
so
becareful
and
try
to
focuse
on
the
fact
that
it
is
not
water
and
an
infinate
imbiation
night
will
probably
lead
to
nothing
good
dont
drink
and
review
made
for
mass
quantity
drinking
after
many
years
drinking
coors
light
and
switching
in
the
last
two
years
to
more
complex
brews
i
wonder
what
the
hell
was
i
thinking
and
drinking
recently
i
venture
to
the
world
of
coors
light
and
the
experience
was
disappointing
no
matter
if
it
comes
from
a
bottle
tap
or
can
like
many
light
beers
the
aroma
taste
and
body
is
not
apparent
the
only
good
think
about
this
brew
is
that
you
can
drink
it
all
night
i
quess
a
proper
thank
you
to
coors
light
is
in
place
for
supplying
my
youth
with
inexpensive
and
tasteless
beer
thank
you
this
beer
poured
a
very
light
gold
color
with
a
large
head
that
disappeared
quickly
if
it
were
any
lighter
in
color
id
swear
this
was
sprite
or
7up
aroma
was
fruity
with
a
good
amount
of
corn
mixed
in
the
nose
i
could
taste
some
malt
but
it
had
mostly
a
sweet
lemony
flavor
along
with
a
grainy
corn
taste
i
could
detect
no
hop
bitterness
at
all
mouthfeel
was
very
light
in
the
palate
the
only
way
i
could
see
drinking
this
again
would
be
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
when
nothing
else
was
available
not
recommended
d
this
is
the
worst
of
the
big
three
in
my
opinion
if
they
would
spend
more
money
and
make
better
beers
than
trying
to
repackage
or
remarket
these
i
might
try
it
again
but
as
it
stands
bmc
is
dead
to
me
coors
light
also
is
like
instant
hangover
for
me
after
two
i
get
a
headache
and
i
want
to
orge
and
im
still
at
the
bar
for
what
it
is
it
isnt
all
that
bad
it
has
the
same
apperance
and
charactaristics
as
other
macro
light
beers
however
it
has
a
bit
more
flavor
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
type
of
beer
is
meant
to
be
easy
to
drink
and
it
does
its
job
well
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
a
decent
light
beer
id
go
with
this
one
just
dont
smell
it
goes
down
like
seltzer
water
a
fizzy
concoction
that
will
get
you
drunk
for
cheap
though
if
youve
been
drinking
microbrews
all
day
it
will
probably
help
you
sober
up
as
it
says
on
the
can
nothings
more
refreshing
than
an
ice
cold
coors
light
what
a
wonderful
lager
the
silver
bullet
i
admitted
to
being
slightly
disappointed
with
the
coors
light
as
a
poor
replacement
for
tsing
tao
but
i
could
see
where
thirsty
masses
as
football
games
might
like
this
on
hot
days
good
stuff
its
balanced
and
its
so
light
i
could
probably
drink
a
whole
case
but
why
would
i
want
to
cute
little
hoppy
bite
definately
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
really
much
to
say
here
except
that
i
feel
like
im
drinking
an
unsweetened
sprite
drink
only
when
absolutely
neccessary
overall
it
was
not
as
offensive
as
expected
not
exactly
a
ringing
endorsement
better
than
many
other
beers
of
the
style
best
served
ice
cold
since
not
much
to
taste
of
course
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
many
but
could
if
the
need
arose
d
well
if
you
wanna
you
could
drink
this
for
a
week
straight
easy
to
drink
but
you
get
nothing
from
it
as
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
its
honestly
the
best
option
when
compared
to
the
rest
i
guess
you
could
say
its
the
tallest
midget
better
than
bud
light
or
miller
light
remember
how
your
mother
always
said
if
you
dont
have
anything
nice
to
say
dont
say
anything
at
all
thats
kind
of
what
im
doing
here
despite
all
of
that
it
is
highly
drinkable
from
the
standpoint
of
being
so
utterly
bland
that
its
inoffensive
i
drank
about
half
of
it
and
then
switched
to
warm
brita
filtered
water
which
actually
seemed
less
watery
oh
well
drinkability
its
quaffable
but
so
is
h2o
while
i
prefer
this
to
some
of
the
higher
strength
macros
like
bud
and
fosters
its
still
a
forgettable
massmarket
nothing
beer
football
tailgating
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
for
the
better
beer
drinker
so
i
reverted
back
to
college
days
of
excessive
imbibition
of
macro
funk
as
there
was
no
other
option
except
liquor
and
wanted
to
remember
the
game
if
i
could
this
could
be
easily
drunk
after
exercise
as
it
is
ridiculously
watery
and
devoid
of
taste
what
taste
there
is
consists
of
cereal
grains
corn
and
other
adjuncts
i
imagine
adolph
coors
wouldnt
be
thrilled
to
have
his
name
associated
with
this
swill
i
cant
believe
how
much
of
this
stuff
i
used
to
drink
yikes
very
clear
golden
yellow
head
dissapated
quikly
with
no
lace
on
top
or
sides
it
has
more
um
aroma
than
taste
mostly
light
grain
smell
plus
some
malt
taste
is
well
balanced
but
has
some
sort
of
off
flavor
i
think
it
comes
from
the
water
used
i
taste
it
everytime
i
drink
a
coors
product
its
not
that
great
but
i
buy
a
twelve
pack
now
and
again
first
of
all
to
be
fair
i
remember
having
this
beer
in
the
past
and
it
actually
tasting
a
little
better
than
it
did
when
i
just
poured
it
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
a
very
off
smelling
odor
i
cant
really
pinpoint
what
it
is
the
taste
is
basically
the
same
there
is
absolutely
no
trace
of
any
malt
or
hops
but
there
is
a
very
off
tasting
bite
that
is
not
pleasant
at
all
again
to
be
fair
maybe
the
can
i
poured
this
from
was
just
a
bad
batch
that
said
from
this
taste
test
plus
memories
of
the
past
from
this
brew
i
can
say
this
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
macro
light
beers
the
problem
is
that
not
only
is
there
not
even
a
hint
of
malt
or
hop
taste
to
the
beer
but
the
brew
has
a
very
off
tasting
bite
which
makes
it
not
pleasant
to
drink
by
the
way
i
am
careful
to
always
review
by
style
as
i
believe
there
are
actually
good
macros
out
there
if
you
want
a
macro
try
a
schlit
as
it
is
light
years
better
than
this
stuff
if
you
ever
wanna
drink
a
beer
that
tastes
exactly
like
water
then
you
have
found
it
although
a
coors
light
may
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
it
is
not
something
you
want
to
keep
as
the
cornerstone
of
your
collection
i
came
back
to
this
old
timer
after
years
exploring
other
beers
and
the
same
holds
true
the
main
appeal
of
this
beerto
me
is
its
ability
to
not
taste
really
like
beer
at
all
it
is
definately
a
light
beer
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
wow
that
new
frost
liner
really
works
i
guess
i
pour
beer
into
a
glass
however
first
sip
cant
you
taste
the
rockie
montains
well
if
you
can
your
taste
buds
are
way
better
then
mine
the
beer
poured
an
unappealing
light
yellow
that
looks
almost
clear
the
smell
and
taste
where
almost
nonexistant
the
mouthfeel
was
light
was
felt
like
i
was
drinking
spoiled
water
i
had
to
dump
this
beer
because
each
sip
made
me
cringe
its
easy
to
see
why
coors
light
is
so
popular
when
cold
its
virtually
tasteless
especially
from
the
bottle
inoffensive
and
arguably
refreshing
given
its
characteristic
similarity
to
water
but
in
the
long
run
i
would
take
virtually
any
beer
over
coors
light
and
really
feel
bad
for
some
of
the
people
who
truly
think
that
it
is
the
be
all
and
end
all
of
beer
overall
i
dont
see
how
people
could
drink
this
shit
if
they
put
a
little
flavor
in
it
i
might
drink
it
water
tastes
better
coors
light
is
one
of
the
top
selling
beers
in
the
world
but
dont
let
this
convince
you
that
coors
light
sells
well
because
of
its
quality
in
reality
this
is
a
poor
excuse
for
a
beer
with
little
or
no
taste
and
a
flavor
profile
similar
to
its
parent
brew
its
a
beer
to
forget
coors
light
has
a
very
watery
taste
with
little
malt
or
hop
influence
the
colour
is
a
very
light
yellow
and
this
relates
to
its
light
flavour
this
beer
has
so
little
character
one
has
to
wonder
why
so
many
people
drink
it
it
would
seem
that
most
drink
it
to
be
social
as
they
feel
the
need
to
drink
something
and
this
is
the
tamest
it
gets
d
when
its
free
its
always
drinkable
when
your
choices
are
limited
to
just
bud
light
and
coors
light
i
think
ill
always
grab
the
coors
light
overall
the
worst
of
the
macros
i
see
no
reason
to
pick
this
up
in
the
future
ended
up
with
an
18
pack
somehow
anyways
poured
it
into
a
mug
and
the
head
fizzled
like
sparkling
lemonade
or
something
like
that
was
completely
gone
in
20
seconds
left
literally
nothing
no
ring
nothing
yellow
pale
yellow
palest
clear
beer
ive
ever
seen
beside
a
belgian
white
smell
wasnt
too
bad
doesnt
reek
of
corn
miller
lite
or
smell
like
nothing
michelob
ultra
taste
is
interesting
for
a
mass
produced
light
beer
it
actually
has
a
hop
bite
to
it
i
cant
tell
if
its
some
kind
of
acidic
metallic
bitterness
from
the
new
can
liners
which
is
just
synthetically
painted
on
by
the
way
we
tried
melting
scratching
and
separating
the
liner
to
no
avail
its
as
smooth
as
the
outer
can
so
im
assuming
its
just
bluish
paint
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
water
the
drinkability
however
if
these
are
ice
ice
cold
it
beats
the
rodney
king
out
of
miller
lite
no
matter
how
much
i
hate
coors
for
donating
to
conservative
causes
and
more
extreme
things
like
kkkish
shady
political
campaigns
in
the
south
the
new
heineken
light
has
this
pinned
down
by
a
sniper
rifle
though
i
had
this
beer
in
the
bottle
this
time
and
i
dont
know
there
is
just
something
i
like
about
this
beer
its
not
very
complex
and
its
unexciting
at
best
but
i
can
drink
them
all
night
and
not
want
to
stop
most
beers
like
this
make
me
tired
and
sick
but
this
one
seems
crisper
in
the
end
i
wouldnt
choose
it
over
many
of
the
beers
out
there
but
it
is
a
great
substitute
for
a
glass
of
water
salud
when
i
want
to
drink
a
good
beer
this
is
not
the
first
thing
i
go
for
generally
i
will
work
my
way
down
a
list
before
coming
to
this
but
if
i
run
into
a
beer
list
that
looks
like
amheuser
and
coors
wrote
it
i
will
probably
go
with
a
coors
light
or
as
i
like
to
think
of
it
one
of
the
lesser
evils
its
piss
water
lets
be
frank
here
theres
nothing
to
it
but
a
little
flavor
and
a
little
alcohol
but
i
can
drink
this
stuff
all
night
long
and
it
wont
bother
me
it
doesnt
give
you
that
nasty
mouth
tasts
other
cheap
brands
seem
to
if
youre
going
cheap
i
guess
go
coors
light
if
youre
looking
for
something
to
take
out
on
the
boat
look
elsewhere
there
are
more
drinkable
swills
out
there
for
an
equal
or
smaller
price
tag
pours
straw
yellow
with
carbonation
and
small
white
head
that
will
dissapear
in
about
5
seconds
taste
is
of
water
flavored
corn
not
very
tasty
at
all
ver
watered
down
smell
is
of
maybe
a
bit
of
corn
with
a
light
hop
smell
not
very
good
try
mixing
it
with
a
v8
to
increase
flavor
cost
and
availability
make
this
a
good
beer
for
drankin
refreshing
enough
on
a
hot
day
tastes
like
home
taste
the
cold
huh
very
light
no
extremly
light
yellow
color
smells
like
nothing
tastes
faintly
very
faintly
like
beer
well
if
you
took
a
semidecent
macro
lager
and
watered
it
down
overall
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
cant
score
it
more
than
2
for
overall
drinkability
beer
is
supposed
to
have
some
well
substance
coors
light
doesnt
have
any
substance
to
it
carbonated
water
with
a
hint
of
beer
zima
has
more
flavor
than
this
had
dont
know
if
its
still
around
but
i
couldnt
give
it
all
ones
since
something
with
no
flavor
is
better
than
something
that
tastes
nasty
light
yellow
in
color
white
head
everyone
has
seen
this
one
doesnt
taste
or
smell
like
much
but
i
do
find
this
beer
to
have
a
slightly
more
citrusy
taste
than
the
others
like
it
must
be
the
yeast
overall
this
beer
is
very
watery
and
it
doesnt
leave
a
bad
aftertaste
like
bl
it
is
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
only
i
dont
really
reccomend
it
this
is
not
good
not
even
for
a
light
beer
i
tried
it
to
see
why
it
was
popular
i
tried
to
be
objective
and
rate
it
in
comparison
to
other
light
beers
though
the
concept
still
baffles
me
in
a
way
but
it
turned
out
to
be
nothing
drinkability
i
would
have
given
it
a
1
0
but
it
sorta
quenched
my
thirst
much
better
choices
for
less
money
or
equal
avoid
this
one
another
nobeer
from
the
states
what
a
waste
poured
a
very
pale
gold
with
a
big
white
that
dissapeared
quite
fast
the
aroma
was
plack
pepper
faintly
sweet
and
grainy
the
taste
was
crisp
watery
and
carbonated
just
a
slight
grain
taste
comming
through
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
bubbly
very
thirst
quenching
theres
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
because
theres
no
flavor
to
offend
your
taste
buds
blah
watery
and
bland
are
two
words
that
comes
to
mind
after
drinking
one
of
these
im
not
sure
what
this
was
supposed
to
taste
like
i
guess
i
missed
out
on
the
rocky
mountatin
flavor
worse
than
bud
and
miller
this
got
pretty
nasty
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
id
take
water
over
this
just
as
most
american
macro
brews
go
this
beer
is
quite
mediocre
in
all
ways
simple
virtually
tasteless
brew
watery
and
weak
this
beer
pours
ugly
tastes
weak
but
has
a
few
redeeming
qualities
i
suppose
when
drinking
with
the
guys
its
tolerable
and
good
to
get
drunk
on
as
i
rated
has
a
good
drinkability
if
you
plan
on
drinking
in
high
quantities
and
if
served
very
cold
it
finishes
crisp
overall
a
good
tailgating
beer
but
shouldnt
be
viewed
highly
in
any
other
aspect
eric
i
wouldnt
pay
much
to
drink
this
beer
but
there
is
always
someone
offering
this
beer
at
social
gatherings
so
long
as
it
is
coldi
guess
you
could
do
worse
lesson
here
for
me
is
dont
disparage
free
beer
according
to
it
traits
this
beer
is
barely
medicore
however
as
previously
mentioned
this
beer
holds
a
special
position
in
my
beer
selection
the
reason
for
this
is
probably
entirely
intentional
on
coors
part
it
is
entirely
a
reproduction
of
my
first
taste
of
beer
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
always
summons
the
recollection
of
my
first
taste
of
beer
the
soft
introduction
with
the
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
is
reminescent
of
mostly
fond
memories
as
a
beer
intending
not
to
impress
me
but
only
to
remind
me
this
beer
excels
this
beer
invokes
images
of
my
past
and
i
am
reticent
to
reject
those
memories
therefore
when
asked
what
generic
american
beer
i
would
prefer
i
will
always
choose
coors
perhaps
not
because
of
its
inherent
qualities
but
because
of
its
ability
to
connect
with
long
cherished
memories
but
yes
great
beer
always
a
good
one
the
beer
is
water
its
huge
advertising
industry
does
not
change
that
a
good
cold
coors
light
is
never
unwelcome
for
me
sure
it
is
not
what
i
think
makes
a
beer
great
far
from
it
its
utter
blandness
carbonation
and
drinkability
makes
sure
that
is
also
none
of
what
i
think
makes
a
beer
suck
this
is
imoh
the
worst
light
bmc
light
beer
it
lacks
the
taste
of
miller
and
the
crispness
of
bud
in
other
words
there
is
absolutely
nothing
enjoyable
about
this
beer
it
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
slight
head
that
has
dissipated
by
the
time
it
has
reached
my
table
there
is
nothing
to
the
taste
it
tastes
like
bad
beer
it
is
also
a
very
thin
body
i
suppose
that
it
is
possible
to
drink
this
beer
all
night
but
only
if
you
desperately
want
a
buzz
or
are
a
masochist
the
look
is
so
pale
the
flavor
is
just
plain
nonexistent
the
feel
was
slight
fizz
i
guess
i
suppose
some
find
it
drinkable
because
its
so
flavorless
and
thats
the
very
same
reason
i
cant
drink
this
stuff
the
line
needs
to
be
drawn
somewhere
and
coors
light
doesnt
even
come
close
to
that
line
in
the
case
of
regular
beer
selections
at
the
grocery
store
coors
light
ranks
higher
than
most
bud
light
keystone
busch
but
only
someone
who
doesnt
drink
enough
beer
could
call
it
their
favorite
beer
coors
light
tastes
like
water
to
me
i
know
its
light
beer
but
it
should
have
at
least
some
flavor
if
you
like
watery
beers
that
go
down
easy
this
beer
is
for
you
if
you
like
to
play
drinking
games
but
get
full
off
of
beer
easily
drink
coors
light
or
keystone
light
they
are
very
very
easy
to
chug
a
good
light
beer
if
you
want
to
drink
more
than
a
few
very
light
on
the
stomach
and
has
an
almost
chocolate
taste
this
beer
is
good
for
taking
on
a
fishing
trip
or
camping
dont
expect
a
great
beer
but
it
is
better
than
most
light
beers
out
there
this
can
also
be
considerty
beer
for
a
party
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
better
choice
than
many
others
out
there
the
appearance
is
a
light
yellow
the
aroma
was
light
and
smelled
faintly
of
the
malted
grain
the
taste
was
crisp
and
moderately
carbonated
with
a
light
body
and
light
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
average
and
crisp
i
felt
that
the
drinkability
was
pretty
good
for
this
beer
as
it
was
refreshing
and
could
easilly
be
followed
with
another
round
although
im
not
one
for
light
macro
lagers
i
felt
that
this
beer
was
pretty
good
for
its
style
and
can
probably
compete
with
beers
that
have
a
bit
more
body
in
short
this
beer
doesnt
have
alot
of
taste
but
makes
an
excellent
refreshing
light
beer
for
a
bbq
or
a
hot
day
i
hate
rating
products
like
this
but
i
do
it
occasionally
because
i
feel
it
is
neccessary
so
many
people
rate
macros
and
trash
them
i
think
thats
rediculous
what
that
miller
lite
doent
have
any
stewed
plums
or
raisins
in
the
smell
its
piss
yellow
you
dont
say
no
shit
it
doesnt
have
the
attributes
of
a
90
minute
ipa
or
a
fine
crafted
tripel
or
quadruppel
it
isnt
supposed
to
these
are
different
products
marketed
toward
a
different
crowd
of
folks
in
the
way
of
macros
i
think
coors
lt
is
easily
one
of
the
the
best
it
looks
thirst
quenching
anyone
ever
looked
at
a
8
0abv
porter
or
stout
and
thought
thatll
quench
my
thirst
hell
no
coors
light
looks
appealing
when
its
hotter
than
400
hells
and
you
can
chug
gallons
of
it
it
isnt
gonna
win
any
contests
but
its
cheap
thirst
quenching
and
suits
the
purpose
it
was
meant
for
overall
this
bud
and
bud
light
were
the
beers
i
first
choose
to
drink
in
the
style
many
memories
with
this
beer
but
cant
say
its
a
good
one
this
beer
is
awfully
lackluster
and
im
not
one
to
knock
macros
i
love
several
of
them
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
beer
just
a
beer
that
lacks
a
great
deal
of
things
i
can
see
ive
digressed
the
bottom
line
is
that
cl
is
a
pretty
undrinkable
beer
even
for
a
macro
lager
i
will
continue
to
avoid
drinking
this
beer
except
for
under
circumstances
such
as
the
one
described
above
when
it
came
to
me
it
was
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
of
foam
and
that
dissipated
fast
into
nothing
there
was
even
a
lack
of
carbonation
bubbles
through
out
the
pint
glass
smell
i
wish
i
didnt
get
any
aroma
whatsoever
sometimes
i
caught
just
a
little
whiff
of
malt
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
all
the
same
light
and
watery
maybe
not
the
same
the
taste
was
kind
of
grainy
i
could
see
paying
a
dollar
for
this
on
draft
if
there
was
nothing
else
around
if
youre
going
to
choose
between
this
and
bud
light
go
with
bud
light
the
appearance
of
a
coors
light
is
light
yellowgold
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
no
lacing
on
the
glass
obviously
smell
is
inconsequential
nothing
really
to
it
grainy
just
like
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
ok
smooth
going
down
this
is
the
type
of
beer
you
have
to
have
ice
cold
at
a
summer
bbq
with
a
burger
or
hot
dog
to
really
enjoy
friends
drink
this
sometimes
and
if
offered
will
not
decline
pours
clear
yellow
piss
color
has
a
very
small
head
that
does
not
like
to
stick
around
could
not
pick
up
a
good
whiff
of
the
scent
taste
like
water
guess
thats
what
a
real
light
beer
is
mouthfeel
is
like
carbonated
water
dont
buy
just
drink
for
free
i
was
offered
this
last
night
at
a
local
bar
so
just
to
be
nice
and
avoid
looking
snobbish
i
accepted
a
pale
barely
straw
yellow
color
with
nasty
aromas
of
grains
and
nothing
else
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
of
hard
tapwater
no
real
taste
at
all
just
subtle
disturbing
chemical
and
organic
suggestions
but
overall
a
very
odd
beverage
i
cant
imagine
why
people
would
want
to
drink
this
even
among
other
macros
i
can
see
some
redeeming
value
in
a
few
of
them
this
one
is
the
worst
beer
ive
tried
making
it
worth
a
review
cheers
pale
straw
with
little
head
retention
at
all
the
smell
is
just
like
any
cheap
adjunt
beercorny
the
taste
is
pretty
awful
it
has
a
shit
beer
taste
which
i
sorta
like
a
bit
but
i
mean
its
still
pretty
bad
for
that
there
is
way
too
little
beer
taste
to
this
its
like
water
the
mouthfeel
is
like
water
as
well
i
have
not
yet
drank
a
more
watery
beer
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
zima
the
drinkability
is
low
cause
i
cant
stand
drinking
something
this
unsatisfying
and
gross
i
gave
it
half
a
point
more
cause
i
figure
if
you
wanted
to
get
sloshed
on
this
which
is
probably
why
poeple
buy
it
mostly
you
can
its
so
watery
i
could
drink
like
5
of
these
and
feel
lnothing
as
far
as
the
stomach
goes
yes
you
can
try
this
at
home
drinkability
stay
away
worst
cheap
beer
imo
this
pours
a
dull
straw
color
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
quicker
than
you
on
payday
the
smell
sort
of
reminds
me
of
vegatables
cooking
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
like
water
the
mouthfeel
is
too
weak
and
watery
for
my
blood
i
drank
30
in
one
sitting
before
and
had
no
buzz
pours
a
typical
macro
lager
yellow
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
smells
pretty
bad
mostly
tasteless
my
first
encounter
with
the
silver
bullet
came
many
years
ago
in
college
it
was
one
of
the
beers
of
choice
for
mass
swilling
because
of
its
lack
of
taste
which
can
only
be
described
as
watery
okay
for
what
it
is
i
will
give
it
credit
of
most
cheap
beers
like
really
cheap
on
sale
beers
i
would
drink
this
over
any
those
beers
it
is
refreshing
it
isnt
filling
it
isnt
expensive
it
does
its
job
right
i
mean
what
could
you
expect
i
think
it
does
its
job
so
for
that
i
give
it
credit
and
i
would
drink
it
at
a
party
but
its
not
something
im
stocking
in
my
fridge
either
anyway
you
know
the
story
another
horrendous
light
beer
possibly
the
worst
of
the
bunch
quite
an
accomplishment
i
dont
usually
bother
reviewing
beers
that
i
despise
i
dont
really
see
the
point
but
i
figured
i
should
review
at
least
one
so
i
knew
what
it
felt
like
to
totally
bash
a
beer
here
goes
this
is
a
bad
bad
beer
colorless
flavorless
odorless
much
like
carbon
monoxide
you
should
try
and
avoid
it
at
all
costs
mcro
lagers
usually
benefit
from
being
extremely
cold
this
one
almost
evaporates
when
extremely
cold
and
as
it
warms
up
well
lets
just
say
it
would
be
better
if
it
did
evaporate
ill
never
understand
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
never
a
bunch
of
friends
left
a
few
shitty
macro
lagers
at
my
apartment
so
i
figured
i
would
review
them
coors
light
is
the
grand
finale
pours
lightest
of
them
all
so
far
decent
head
retention
and
some
lacing
hardly
any
smell
at
all
besides
a
light
sulfur
smell
and
some
stale
grain
taste
is
very
gross
at
least
bud
light
had
the
thoughtfulness
to
taste
like
nothing
there
are
some
crisp
hops
at
the
end
but
that
doesnt
make
up
for
the
sickly
tasting
spoiled
grain
and
sulfur
taste
just
terrible
conclusion
i
think
this
is
actually
nearbeer
when
i
worked
for
a
minor
league
baseball
teams
food
concession
service
i
once
sold
a
guy
a
dozen
pint
bottles
of
this
stuff
i
kept
selling
because
i
couldnt
hear
him
slurr
or
see
his
movements
change
at
all
that
about
sums
coors
light
up
its
only
mildly
unappealing
but
it
also
isnt
really
beer
so
only
godawful
budwieser
gets
a
worse
rating
so
far
and
even
bud
tries
to
formulate
something
that
at
least
parodys
beer
if
you
drink
this
order
a
vodka
and
tonic
or
vodka
and
soda
next
time
and
just
admit
you
dont
like
beer
or
if
youre
ordering
this
because
youve
had
too
much
to
drink
already
or
need
to
drive
home
once
again
stop
pretending
do
your
tastebuds
and
body
a
favor
and
get
a
bottled
water
the
beer
pours
golden
but
there
is
no
head
and
it
does
not
hold
or
lace
the
smell
is
not
to
chemical
but
there
isnt
much
of
a
smell
at
all
the
taste
is
quite
watered
down
but
there
is
nothing
especially
harsh
about
the
taste
it
is
carbonated
well
fairly
smooth
and
not
to
oily
but
really
watery
overall
quite
easy
going
down
for
a
light
macro
beer
pours
a
super
pale
yellow
straw
yellow
big
white
head
forms
but
goes
quickly
no
lace
smell
is
sweet
some
minor
skunk
citrus
and
corn
taste
is
non
existent
some
corn
sweetness
citrus
and
a
little
bit
of
iron
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
hideous
mildly
better
than
silver
bullet
from
a
can
coors
light
in
a
bottle
nevertheless
remains
a
low
quality
brew
as
with
most
of
this
type
of
standard
american
cheap
beer
it
must
be
served
cold
in
order
to
retain
any
form
of
drinkability
whatsoever
weak
and
watery
with
a
puffy
fleeting
head
when
poured
this
is
purely
a
beer
to
have
when
theres
very
little
else
available
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
this
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
quickly
the
smell
is
very
weak
and
has
a
hint
of
cooked
vegatables
the
taste
is
faintly
hoppybut
is
more
like
water
with
a
touch
of
beer
the
mf
is
lightweak
and
watery
i
cant
imagine
ever
trying
this
again
great
for
sessions
of
course
hardly
close
to
my
favorite
beer
but
again
a
nice
respite
between
other
beers
certainly
not
good
and
if
youve
got
micros
around
drink
them
but
for
what
it
is
aint
bad
aint
bad
at
all
first
of
all
i
do
still
enjoy
the
occasional
macro
i
bought
a
24oz
can
of
this
tonight
the
beer
looks
like
any
other
macro
light
in
color
the
smell
reminds
me
of
many
a
campfire
with
my
friends
a
bunch
of
rowdy
kids
drinking
whatever
the
one
person
over
21
brought
or
would
buy
for
them
the
taste
again
is
pretty
much
in
line
with
any
other
macro
there
is
just
not
much
of
a
taste
there
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
smooth
some
macros
are
just
too
harsh
in
the
mouthfeel
to
be
consumed
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
macros
the
drinkability
is
above
average
for
the
style
americam
macro
is
made
to
be
relativaly
inexpensive
and
drinkable
this
one
finds
that
niche
well
this
beer
pours
to
a
light
yellow
and
a
quickly
dissipating
head
smell
is
mostly
of
corn
adjuncts
taste
is
rather
bland
hints
of
corn
in
the
aroma
aftertaste
however
is
minimal
mouthfeel
is
reminiscent
of
soda
water
however
one
could
easily
take
a
12
pack
of
these
and
easily
put
them
back
without
even
thinking
about
it
very
easy
to
drink
just
not
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
gets
a
1
because
if
i
ever
wanted
more
than
one
of
these
refreshing
taste
definitely
an
exeption
among
macros
awolfatthedoornov

this
was
really
difficult
to
drink
why
because
it
has
additives
that
make
it
really
heavy
in
the
palate
taste
and
mouthfeel
good
i
went
to
my
old
home
town
of
schaller
piss

a
can

slightly

in

with

i
would

near

this
beer
pours
the

light

with
no

has

metalic
maybe
something
a
bit
soapy
overly
carbonated
for
the
lack
of
taste
perhaps
trying
to
distract
you
and
it
bothered
the
sin
out
of
my
stomach
after
three
beers
busch
light
i
have
rarely
been
more
ready
for
a
macsmack
to
end
than
i
am
today
these
are
two
of
the
worst
beers
that
ive
ever
had
the
displeasure
to
consume
still
though
there
are
degrees
of
badness
as
the
macro
smackdown
series
never
fails
to
demonstrate
coors
light
is
lousy
plain
and
simple
the
boys
from
golden
can
use
whatever
flashy
marketing
slogans
they
wish
silver
bullet
the
only
reason
this
one
is
better
than
coors
is
because
there
is
no
taste
and
there
is
no
smell
there
is
also
no
worthwhile
head
or
color
this
thing
is
thin
on
all
fronts
and
the
only
thing
going
for
it
is
that
if
you
are
thirsty
you
can
drink
it
fast
because
it
is
barely
more
than
water
in
consistensy
it
really
isnt
worth
your
time
if
you
want
something
that
tastes
like
beer
what
in
the
hell
are
those
golden
co
folks
up
to
the
coors
products
ive
tasted
are
simply
unacceptable
this
beer
itself
may
be
the
worst
beer
ive
sampled
drinkable
beer
bong
style
otherwise
not
suited
for
sipping
the
silver
bullet
a
crappy
looking
beer
it
pours
the
normal
golden
color
of
just
about
any
macro
beer
around
looks
very
flat
and
watery
the
smells
are
faint
although
i
notice
some
malt
character
the
taste
is
unimpressive
not
bad
tasting
by
any
means
but
theres
just
not
much
to
it
quite
boring
mabye
a
little
to
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
i
wouldnt
have
really
expected
anything
else
very
drinkable
and
quite
easy
to
consume
mass
quantities
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
summer
afternoon
grillout
if
its
free
a
thin
watery
amber
color
a
brief
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
no
lace
as
for
the
aroma
its
weird
because
even
though
there
is
so
little
to
pick
out
its
still
somehow
bad
as
for
the
flavor
well
there
isnt
any
really
except
for
a
very
very
faint
grain
flavor
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
very
little
carbonation
avoid
this
one
very
light
bodied
not
complex
at
all
ill
give
it
points
for
drinkability
because
its
very
watery
and
easy
to
drink
thats
about
it
for
coors
light
special
note
this
beer
is
the
only
beer
ive
ever
had
that
actually
quenched
my
thirst
like
a
nice
glass
of
water
would
have
i
have
successfully
avoided
drinking
this
beer
for
several
years
however
since
it
was
readily
available
at
an
office
party
i
decided
to
give
it
a
go
i
was
surprised
at
the
lack
of
total
disgustingness
i
was
expecting
much
worse
perhaps
it
was
due
to
the
bottle
instead
of
the
can
pours
lightamber
like
diluted
piss
decent
carbonation
no
head
smells
of
skunk
alcohol
i
suppose
a
little
bit
of
wheatness
crept
in
there
maybe
it
was
my
imagination
taste
was
less
skunky
than
i
had
expected
tastes
like
a
beer
with
seltzer
in
it
mouthfeel
hah
drinkable
well
id
rather
have
this
than
busch
light
but
is
that
really
something
to
be
proud
of
how
low
can
a
beer
advocate
go
this
is
pretty
much
the
bottom
tried
a
can
i
took
home
a
month
or
two
ago
from
a
party
hey
at
least
i
didnt
have
topay
for
this
backwash
pours
very
light
yellow
very
clear
very
white
head
which
quickly
departs
slight
sugary
nose
too
watery
no
flavor
no
hops
no
malt
besides
those
obvious
problems
its
great
stuff
drinkability
sure
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
i
had
too
but
i
dont
think
id
ever
want
to
tap
the
motherfin
rockies
indeed
i
am
very
disappointed
in
some
of
the
reviews
of
this
beer
made
by
the
top
reviewers
they
disparage
the
people
who
give
high
ratings
to
these
types
of
beers
as
they
are
nondiscriptive
of
the
beers
however
their
reviews
are
no
more
helpful
merely
commenting
on
the
beers
naming
or
as
waste
is
not
an
intelligent
or
helpful
review
if
you
need
something
that
you
can
drink
all
night
this
is
the
beer
to
choose
i
wil
generally
start
with
a
few
good
beers
and
end
on
the
silver
bullet
as
me
and
my
friends
say
its
like
making
love
in
a
canoe
its
f
close
to
water
there
is
nothing
special
with
the
flavor
but
damn
i
can
put
these
things
back
fast
pours
out
a
pale
straw
color
tons
of
carbonation
has
that
shit
smell
that
i
cant
stand
coors
light
for
actually
smells
like
puke
taste
is
pretty
pale
no
actual
ingredient
i
can
tastebutnot
horrible
i
can
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
not
be
disgusted
no
mouthfeel
if
its
at
a
party
or
if
its
free
f
it
ill
drink
it
bender
as
majors
go
this
one
is
not
offensive
i
see
how
the
ladies
like
it
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
head
that
faded
from
existance
quickly
i
cant
really
smell
anything
maybe
some
malt
it
could
just
be
left
overs
from
the
beer
i
had
before
the
taste
well
was
not
too
impressive
the
flavor
was
just
not
there
it
was
quite
bland
to
say
the
least
i
have
ho
idea
how
coors
sells
so
much
of
this
stuff
certainly
not
for
a
beer
purist
but
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
this
beer
for
example
perhaps
after
running
a
marathon
on
the
surface
of
the
sun
this
little
baby
might
slide
down
very
nicely
or
to
the
lesser
extreme
after
a
hard
workout
at
the
gym
more
water
like
than
beer
like
but
i
dont
find
it
horrid
tasted
120204
well
i
am
surprised
that
i
have
not
posed
a
review
of
coors
light
before
but
i
guess
i
am
bored
tonight
had
a
few
today
while
out
at
a
dive
bar
with
some
friends
watching
the
dolphins49rs
game
bad
beer
bad
game
brew
pours
to
a
very
pale
yellow
clear
color
with
a
good
sized
white
head
that
just
disappears
leaving
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
bland
nothing
exciting
going
on
here
basic
malt
aroma
that
is
hard
to
notice
hop
aroma
yeah
right
the
taste
is
very
bland
as
well
and
what
flavor
it
does
have
is
not
overly
enjoyable
beyond
that
there
is
not
much
else
to
write
about
on
this
beer
brewed
in
canada
under
license
of
coors
by
molson
have
a
couple
friends
who
only
drink
this
so
when
you
go
to
their
house
this
is
the
only
option
pale
watered
down
yellow
color
very
little
carbonation
left
after
the
pour
the
smell
that
comes
off
of
this
is
very
sour
little
or
no
flavor
other
than
a
metalic
aftertaste
and
more
grainy
sourness
what
else
can
you
say
another
mass
produced
product
with
a
huge
marketing
budget
best
served
ice
cold
cant
see
myself
spending
money
on
this
watered
down
beer
overall
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
easily
drinkable
inexpensive
surprisingly
solid
nothing
more
than
that
drinkability
you
could
drink
a
case
of
this
stuff
with
little
to
no
effort
its
essentially
flavored
water
alcohol
the
next
time
im
at
a
party
and
this
is
the
only
thing
being
served
i
will
volunteer
to
be
the
designated
driver
tap
the
sewers
yuck
this
was
bad
how
can
you
mix
a
watery
and
a
skunky
taste
coors
did
it
like
out
of
date
water
thats
been
taken
from
the
sewers
of
new
york
worse
than
bud
light
because
bud
light
tastes
like
bottled
water
i
would
rather
have
bottled
water
than
sewer
water
for
the
beginner
i
would
at
least
recommend
bud
thirst
quenching
stick
to
water
the
beer
pours
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
luminous
gold
color
with
the
head
modest
in
size
and
white
in
color
the
texture
frothy
with
the
residual
lace
a
thin
sheet
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
crisp
and
clean
with
the
start
lightly
sweet
and
the
top
thin
in
feel
finish
is
perky
in
acidity
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
dry
aftertaste
what
can
you
say
it
is
what
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
mass
produce
at
the
lowest
cost
possible
well
the
other
night
i
was
drinking
with
a
few
of
my
lessenlightened
friend
i
had
a
few
bombers
of
my
favorite
stone
ipa
but
my
brother
had
foolishly
set
the
refridgerator
so
low
that
the
beer
somewhat
froze
as
i
waited
for
over
an
hour
for
the
beer
to
completely
liquify
i
grew
impatient
and
asked
my
buddy
sean
for
a
beer
it
was
a
choice
of
either
coors
light
or
bud
light
and
i
of
course
took
the
coors
light
i
opened
the
can
and
the
light
airy
smell
drifted
towards
my
nose
as
i
detected
the
scent
i
asked
myself
one
question
why
god
why
would
anyone
brew
much
less
drink
this
beer
i
dont
quite
know
what
it
tasted
like
because
there
was
so
little
to
taste
the
thing
was
horribly
pale
in
color
and
smelled
just
how
it
tasted
with
less
malt
than
one
would
find
in
chocolate
milk
shake
are
there
even
hops
in
there
i
couldnt
find
em
it
did
manage
a
mighty
2
in
the
mouthfeel
category
because
of
its
cool
smoothness
combined
with
a
mild
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
nonexistent
as
the
beer
made
me
nauseous
thankfully
my
first
bomber
of
ipa
was
ready
for
consumption
15
minutes
later
and
my
palate
was
saved
anyhow
if
youre
looking
to
lure
children
into
your
basement
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
completely
inoffensive
and
smooth
as
silk
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
not
a
good
beer
for
the
price
either
though
looking
back
coors
light
was
the
first
legal
beer
i
ever
had
and
years
before
possibly
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
period
its
so
watereddown
and
i
thought
that
was
what
beer
was
supposed
to
tasted
like
anyway
i
dont
turn
down
beer
regardless
of
what
it
is
so
ill
keep
drinking
this
as
it
is
a
staple
of
some
of
my
relatives
the
color
is
a
really
pale
yellow
and
i
find
it
tastes
best
when
im
drinking
it
and
a
bottle
of
water
at
the
same
time
so
that
i
can
forget
its
beer
at
all
and
pretend
im
just
drinking
water
or
mixed
with
v8
so
i
can
pretend
im
just
drinking
v8
ba
tells
you
to
always
write
something
critically
informative
about
a
beer
so
i
will
start
with
my
thesis
and
then
elaborate
on
it
quite
simply
put
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
it
pours
a
terribly
pale
yellow
with
tons
of
rapidly
receding
foam
head
the
smell
was
mostly
corn
as
is
the
taste
which
has
so
much
starchy
sweetness
from
whatever
they
put
in
it
that
it
has
actually
succeeded
in
being
the
only
beer
that
triggers
my
gag
reflex
so
why
did
i
drink
this
because
this
is
what
gets
served
at
house
parties
where
people
dont
have
lots
of
money
and
need
beer
to
play
some
beiruit
seeing
as
how
this
is
the
only
beer
that
has
consistently
made
me
choke
every
time
i
drink
it
i
cannot
give
it
more
than
a
1
for
any
single
aspect
of
it
but
hey
its
cheap
flavor
not
well
balanced
some
bitterness
at
the
start
that
lingers
much
longer
than
needed
and
finishing
with
a
mouth
puckering
aftertaste
i
fully
recognize
the
fact
that
coors
light
isnt
a
great
beer
or
probably
even
a
good
beer
but
its
still
a
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
i
practically
grew
up
drinking
coors
light
and
have
found
it
to
be
a
reliable
easytodrink
kind
of
beer
the
aroma
and
appearence
are
fairly
less
than
average
and
the
taste
is
even
slightly
below
average
still
an
ice
cold
coors
light
always
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
high
level
of
drinkability
for
me
coors
light
is
the
perfect
cheap
macrobrew
to
beat
the
heat
in
the
summer
drinkability
a
standard
for
the
macro
crowd
ive
had
plenty
of
these
preba
i
can
still
enjoy
them
in
the
right
setting
i
just
dont
as
often
coors
light
has
been
getting
hammered
by
fellow
advocates
and
i
think
its
because
were
missing
the
true
reason
for
this
brew
sure
coors
light
is
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
good
beer
but
thats
not
what
its
all
about
its
not
a
beer
for
the
middle
aged
guinness
drinking
connoisseur
this
is
a
beginner
beer
a
lackluster
brew
for
that
high
school
kid
just
entering
the
world
of
beer
a
brew
for
fifteen
year
old
johnny
whos
just
a
double
duece
away
from
getting
to
second
base
with
suzie
down
the
street
thats
who
this
beer
is
for
so
while
many
beers
are
mediocre
and
bland
at
least
the
silver
bullet
serves
a
purpose
in
being
so
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
so
popular
is
irrefutable
proof
that
you
should
never
underestimate
the
power
of
stupid
people
in
large
numbers
god
save
our
planet
mouthfeel
is
thin
the
zippy
carbonation
is
about
the
best
aspect
of
the
beer
drinkability
is
easy
enough
but
for
me
i
will
never
subject
myself
to
this
beer
again
its
pretty
much
water
at
least
it
isnt
full
of
bad
flavor
and
i
can
definitely
say
that
ive
had
worse
joey
this
beer
can
best
be
used
in
place
of
water
when
they
run
out
of
it
at
a
beer
festival
it
poured
a
bright
yellow
with
nearly
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
was
pretty
much
nonexistant
the
taste
followed
suit
and
resembled
carbonated
water
more
than
anything
else
if
i
was
suffering
from
severe
dehydration
i
still
wouldnt
have
another
one
of
these
1
out
of
5
swills
i
dont
understand
why
this
bloody
beer
remains
very
popular
among
the
masses
of
america
everything
you
can
think
that
is
wrong
with
beer
is
in
coors
light
the
appearance
looks
like
a
urine
sample
actually
a
urine
sample
has
more
colour
than
a
coors
light
the
smell
is
nonexistant
the
taste
lacks
flavor
and
it
is
very
watery
finally
you
could
pound
down
numerous
cans
because
it
is
easy
to
drink
if
you
dont
want
beer
poop
in
the
morning
then
dont
drink
coors
light
argh
what
can
i
say
its
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
for
me
its
the
lowest
of
the
lows
and
it
saddens
me
for
it
to
be
one
of
the
highest
selling
beers
in
the
country
it
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
tastes
like
water
and
some
malt
smells
like
water
nothing
and
overall
its
just
a
beer
made
for
college
students
drinkable
but
not
good
there
really
are
no
good
light
beers
notes
this
whole
its
good
on
a
hott
day
crap
is
driving
me
crazy
its
good
becaue
its
like
water
period
it
isnt
good
beer
the
guys
at
coors
are
making
millions
on
this
junk
what
is
the
world
coming
to
a
light
straw
gold
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
a
light
smell
of
yeast
and
malt
the
taste
is
lightly
yeasty
with
some
malt
and
fruitieness
a
nice
light
beer
this
is
a
real
standby
while
i
would
rather
have
a
blue
moon
or
a
coors
given
the
option
of
bud
or
something
similar
a
coors
light
will
do
coors
light
is
not
a
bad
light
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
manly
because
it
tastes
like
water
you
can
pop
alot
of
these
anytime
of
the
day
it
is
very
drinkable
the
look
of
this
beer
is
colorless
with
hints
of
yellow
no
smell
and
really
no
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
isnt
awful
because
there
isnt
really
a
smell
the
taste
is
like
a
refreshing
water
on
a
hot
day
but
is
that
what
we
want
in
our
beer
taste
some
hop
but
not
much
coors
light
is
not
the
light
beer
commercials
will
have
you
believe
pass
on
this
if
you
need
a
light
beer
try
miller
lite
at
least
it
tastes
somewhat
like
beer
well
my
dad
gave
me
a
30
pack
of
this
and
i
am
not
one
to
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
what
can
i
say
about
this
brew
that
hasnt
already
been
written
i
drank
from
the
can
ice
cold
i
know
what
this
beer
looks
like
pale
thin
yellow
with
a
minute
head
smell
is
neither
enticing
nor
offensive
mildly
sweet
with
no
hop
aroma
taste
well
theres
a
reason
i
drank
it
ice
cold
to
dull
the
taste
it
is
a
macro
with
adjunct
rice
and
a
tiny
bit
of
amlt
flavor
finishes
dry
do
there
must
be
a
hop
in
there
but
not
enough
to
add
enjoyment
it
is
not
too
too
terrible
to
pound
down
a
few
as
a
quencher
because
there
is
nothing
there
to
offend
i
suppose
this
isnt
quite
as
bad
as
i
expected
if
pressed
i
could
drink
this
at
a
family
bbq
just
2
or
3
though
words
cannot
describe
my
utter
dislike
for
this
brew
if
this
were
the
only
beer
available
at
a
party
i
would
rather
not
drink
the
taste
is
awful
the
appearance
is
as
close
to
club
soda
as
you
can
get
the
mouthfeel
is
awfully
sour
and
drinkability
next
to
impossible
a
true
macro
crap
beer
far
too
much
carbonation
and
too
little
flavour
cheers
come
on
its
called
the
silver
bullet
any
beer
that
has
a
nick
name
ie
natty
ice
silver
bullet
cant
be
good
the
one
redeeming
quality
that
this
beer
has
is
that
fact
that
it
has
alcohol
in
it
after
downing
about
3
good
beers
this
beer
is
tollerable
to
keep
the
night
going
thats
about
all
its
good
for
oh
and
maybe
getting
back
from
some
sort
of
physical
event
like
running
or
biking
its
good
to
rehydrate
with
very
much
like
water
this
beer
was
something
that
i
refused
in
college
when
i
didnt
know
that
much
about
beer
today
i
wont
refuse
it
but
i
wont
choose
it
why
is
that
well
it
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
macro
light
lager
a
ton
of
people
love
it
and
drink
it
daily
it
is
consistently
brewed
and
always
fresh
the
beer
reeks
of
corn
and
the
taste
is
all
adjunct
as
well
but
it
is
clean
smooth
and
absolutely
drinkable
nothing
like
the
beers
that
i
normally
drink
but
definitely
serves
a
purpose
you
can
sense
a
hint
of
hops
from
time
to
time
but
they
are
a
focus
of
the
beer
dont
seek
it
out
but
accept
the
fact
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
popular
beers
in
the
country
super
advertising
on
the
24
ounce
can
silver
and
gold
some
black
accents
this
one
being
a
commemorative
super
bowl
xxviii
collectors
item
wait
this
isnt
part
of
the
rating
medium
yellow
hue
zero
head
beady
carbonation
has
a
weak
perfume
like
aroma
up
front
thin
and
weak
bodied
has
very
little
hop
or
malt
flavoring
maybe
some
faint
grainygrassy
notes
which
should
be
illegal
for
beer
no
body
no
character
and
call
it
no
taste
i
feel
sorry
for
those
who
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
the
silver
bullet
comes
in
a
brown
bottle
which
is
the
what
i
drank
it
from
smells
lightly
oof
malt
and
a
little
adjunct
taste
is
not
very
offensive
but
there
is
almost
nothing
to
it
no
complexity
no
hops
kick
nothing
just
another
macro
imo
i
remember
when
the
silver
bullet
made
its
debut
in
my
local
lcbo
liquor
control
board
of
ontario
store
back
in
the
mid
80s
i
remember
thinking
wow
such
a
flashy
can
so
this
is
american
beer
how
exotic
ah
the
folly
of
youth
like
all
massed
produced
light
beers
appearance
was
as
if
my
dog
nevermind
smell
well
thankfully
there
wasnt
much
smell
there
taste
had
a
little
bit
of
a
bitterness
and
maybe
some
malt
to
it
not
much
else
no
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
since
its
like
drinking
water
widely
available
in
canada
had
it
because
it
was
the
most
drinkable
of
non
drinkable
beers
at
a
shalom
zachor
a
friday
night
gathering
after
a
baby
is
born
in
judaism
where
traditionally
beer
is
served
agree
its
carbonated
tonic
water
with
a
little
beer
taste
yes
it
is
drinkable
as
massproduced
light
beers
go
my
brotherinlaw
always
has
it
around
and
when
were
out
in
the
sun
by
the
pool
and
i
didnt
bring
my
own
well
ill
confess
ive
been
known
to
knock
a
few
back
and
even
if
im
not
impressed
i
seldom
actively
regret
it
thx
i
didnt
want
to
review
such
crappy
beers
but
i
feel
its
my
duty
to
report
the
bad
beers
along
with
the
good
ones
coors
light
is
definitely
the
worst
one
lackluster
color
just
barely
yellow
no
head
to
speak
of
the
carbonation
is
largebubbled
and
very
like
drinking
a
coke
not
too
sweet
flavor
and
a
little
more
bitter
in
the
finish
than
miller
lite
nothing
here
is
offensive
though
i
didnt
mention
the
aroma
because
it
doesnt
have
one
to
speak
of
i
should
have
followed
my
instincts
and
brought
along
a
sixer
of
bells
or
three
floyds
i
didnt
and
my
palate
paid
the
price
considering
the
other
options
were
corona
extra
and
some
malternative
c
l
was
the
least
of
the
three
evils
next
time
ill
just
drink
water
so
to
answer
the
question
yes
it
does
get
better
from
here
much
much
better
but
when
out
in
okarche
oklahoma
god
i
hope
i
spelled
okarche
right
and
youre
eatin
fried
chicken
coors
light
might
be
all
thats
available
i
think
they
had
some
miller
products
and
i
know
they
had
bud
but
really
out
of
those
ill
take
a
coors
light
any
day
of
the
week
appearance
was
yellow
water
smell
was
bland
and
flat
taste
the
same
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
you
can
drink
lots
of
these
bastards
mass
produced
tripe
i
pretty
much
will
only
drink
this
stuff
when
someone
offers
you
a
beer
at
their
house
very
pale
and
yellowish
not
much
head
unless
you
try
to
pour
it
sloppy
i
have
found
that
you
can
drink
it
hot
and
it
doesnt
taste
that
much
worse
than
when
its
cold
good
for
boiling
brats
in
and
buying
in
bulk
for
parties
in
the
summer
although
i
find
the
aroma
to
be
quite
pleasing
the
taste
ruins
it
not
an
enjoyable
beer
for
me
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
28jun03
this
post
reflects
notes
in
that
review
a
very
very
mild
and
shallow
flavor
yes
theres
a
hint
of
malt
and
hops
fizz
coors
doesnt
state
the
alcohol
percentage
i
suspect
its
quite
light
i
will
say
this
on
ice
with
some
club
soda
or
just
soda
water
this
beer
will
give
a
mild
flavor
something
different
to
the
conventional
fruity
flavored
water
oh
the
silver
bullet
how
i
loathe
your
horrible
commercials
i
wouldnt
touch
you
but
you
came
in
a
raiders
can
and
i
had
to
have
you
pours
bright
pale
yellow
smells
like
typical
cheap
beer
tastes
metallic
and
slightly
sweet
with
lots
of
carbonation
it
is
what
it
is
light
cheap
beer
im
sure
you
didnt
know
that
so
consider
yourself
enlightened
notes
in
terms
of
calories
and
price
what
can
be
said
poor
offputting
beer
if
you
like
it
good
for
you
a
body
does
need
liquid
refreshment
at
times
this
may
even
be
cheaper
than
evian
to
drink
im
sure
but
before
ill
ever
drink
it
again
youll
have
to
put
a
silver
bullet
in
the
back
of
my
head
and
then
you
would
have
to
wedge
my
mouth
open
very
pale
gold
color
medium
head
aroma
is
very
slight
and
kind
of
grainy
very
little
malts
nearly
no
hops
very
light
taste
nearly
no
taste
at
all
is
it
really
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
nearly
neutral
is
this
even
beer
more
like
a
beer
flavored
water
for
the
bjcp
style
american
light
lager
this
is
around
the
4
2
5
its
nice
and
dry
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
as
desired
but
its
hurt
by
the
odd
aroma
thank
you
coors
light
for
making
budweiser
look
almost
drinkable
in
comparison
the
only
thing
more
watery
than
this
beer
is
keystone
light
lots
of
rocky
mountain
ice
here
not
much
else
maybe
a
twinge
a
grainy
dryness
if
you
need
a
thirst
quencher
here
you
go
and
dont
try
to
taste
it
this
is
a
good
one
for
playing
drinking
games
with
this
is
not
beer
this
water
and
corn
syrup
with
a
light
alcohol
taste
included
no
aroma
no
afertaste
and
hell
even
no
taste
at
all
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
nonbeer
drinker
i
blame
this
beer
for
making
it
hard
to
convince
people
to
try
to
drink
something
different
since
this
is
so
light
and
therefore
every
other
beers
seems
too
strong
i
cant
believe
it
but
i
actually
like
this
beer
it
must
be
my
favourite
of
the
bigname
american
macros
wow
its
surprisingly
drinkable
this
brew
poured
a
small
quickly
disappearing
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
it
has
a
transparent
weak
urine
yellow
body
it
has
little
to
no
aroma
its
flavor
that
is
slightly
hoppy
with
an
initially
fizzy
mouthfeel
that
soon
fades
the
best
thing
about
it
is
that
you
can
get
it
anywhere
drinkibility
dull
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
tastes
okay
it
doesnt
look
good
but
the
taste
is
okay
it
is
better
than
some
light
beers
i
have
had
this
is
my
second
favorite
light
beer
next
to
sam
adams
light
it
wasnt
that
watery
there
may
have
been
too
much
carbonation
a
decent
beer
by
coors
i
liked
their
irish
red
better
didnt
hate
this
beer
as
much
as
i
would
have
like
but
there
also
isnt
any
there
there
has
a
thirst
quenching
quality
but
its
mostly
made
for
quick
drinking
and
quick
drinking
youth
on
the
prowl
believing
drinking
this
will
somehow
make
a
difference
drink
it
fast
before
it
turns
nasty
i
can
imagine
gatherings
with
lots
and
lots
of
half
drank
beers
maybe
thats
how
they
sell
so
much
well
like
most
other
reviews
on
this
one
what
is
left
to
say
no
serious
beer
drinker
would
even
be
looking
at
this
review
so
i
am
wasting
my
time
reviewing
it
actually
if
you
really
want
to
know
my
feelings
if
i
could
give
a
zero
to
this
beer
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkablility
fields
i
would
blech
just
awful
one
of
those
beers
that
deserve
to
only
be
drunk
from
cans
in
order
to
protect
innocent
glassware
mouthfeel
like
water
very
little
taste
in
short
the
perfect
beer
for
those
who
want
to
drink
12
odd
beers
during
the
course
of
the
evening
this
is
a
horrible
beer
it
is
not
even
beer
have
it
ice
cold
on
a
summer
afternoon
and
it
will
go
down
like
water
less
than
a
beer
for
the
masses
a
new
low
coors
light
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
watered
down
and
flavorless
beers
out
there
it
goes
down
easy
because
theres
nothing
to
it
this
beer
poured
a
clear
bright
yellow
with
a
fine
fluffy
white
head
the
bubbles
ascended
through
the
beer
until
the
very
last
gulp
i
would
say
this
was
as
close
to
advertisement
perfect
as
a
beer
can
get
too
bad
i
had
to
drink
it
and
spoil
the
moment
the
beer
had
no
aroma
even
with
such
a
nice
head
the
aroma
was
matched
by
the
flavor
nill
there
was
some
carbonation
in
the
beer
that
provided
some
mouthfeel
but
light
described
the
mouthfeel
not
drinkable
except
in
an
emergency
first
of
all
light
beers
are
no
good
coors
light
has
a
decent
flavor
compared
to
miller
light
and
bud
light
it
doesnt
pour
good
and
doesnt
have
a
head
ok
maybe
for
a
few
seconds
the
taste
is
sweet
almost
fruity
and
the
hops
tickle
the
tongue
one
of
the
few
light
beers
i
can
sit
and
drink
all
night
its
not
that
great
though
and
their
are
many
beers
the
same
price
as
coors
light
that
i
could
recommend
this
hypermarketed
beer
poured
a
light
pale
amber
color
with
a
small
head
i
blinked
and
it
disappeared
no
lacing
and
nothing
remotely
close
to
mentionable
in
the
appearance
there
was
very
little
smell
just
faint
stale
whisps
of
malt
and
corn
the
taste
was
grainy
somewhat
sweer
with
lightcorn
features
barely
palatable
the
seltzerwater
mouthfeel
was
uminmpressive
although
i
suppose
it
felt
interesting
when
i
vigorously
swished
it
in
my
mouth
hey
i
needed
some
entertainment
while
drinking
this
one
overall
coors
light
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
it
delivers
a
bit
of
alcohol
quickly
and
goes
down
painlessly
but
these
are
its
only
qualities
simply
put
yet
another
boring
watery
macro
brew
nothing
daring
pours
a
watered
down
yellow
theres
barely
any
sort
of
smell
here
maybe
a
hint
of
maltiness
every
now
and
again
it
tastes
like
someone
dumped
their
coors
original
in
my
water
which
is
exactly
how
this
one
goes
down
like
water
very
easy
to
drink
as
theres
not
much
going
on
but
at
the
same
time
its
a
far
from
enjoyable
experience
coors
light
is
probably
one
of
the
best
light
beers
around
today
there
is
just
something
about
the
silver
bullet
that
cant
be
beat
by
other
light
beers
definitely
prefer
the
bottle
over
the
can
just
a
psychological
thing
i
guess
recommend
coors
light
to
anyone
uch
canned
coors
light
for
some
odd
reasons
reminds
me
of
creamed
corn
really
pale
colour
clear
sky
yellow
smelled
of
chemical
water
do
they
brew
this
at
a
nuclear
plant
tasted
like
watered
down
beer
very
watered
down
beer
as
in
one
bottle
budweiser
2
litres
aquafina
very
thin
paper
thin
mouthfeel
weak
yes
this
could
be
highly
drinkable
but
why
switch
to
something
better
or
get
water
and
mix
some
vodka
in
it
if
you
want
an
alcoholic
beverage
or
just
drink
water
do
not
try
f
flavor
in
my
mouth
with
all
due
respect
to
my
american
cousins
to
whom
we
owe
great
cultural
and
historical
debts
whats
with
the
silver
bullet
and
can
we
lend
you
something
equally
noxious
like
maybe
molsons
canadian
light
like
the
previous
reviewer
said
the
only
redeemable
qualitly
of
this
beer
is
its
poundablility
this
has
been
a
staple
in
the
beer
bongs
of
parties
i
have
attended
over
the
years
and
after
actually
trying
one
for
real
i
know
why
no
one
in
their
right
mind
would
want
to
drink
this
swill
over
all
the
other
great
beers
out
there
right
now
it
pours
a
thin
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
has
almost
no
smell
other
than
carbonation
and
tastes
like
carbonated
water
the
only
time
i
would
conciter
drinkind
this
would
be
if
i
really
wanted
to
get
drunk
and
it
was
free
on
second
thoutght
not
even
then
a
horrible
brew
and
even
more
proof
that
lightbad
this
is
pale
yellow
in
color
with
very
little
head
that
quickly
disappears
hardly
any
aroma
lots
of
carbonation
a
little
more
flavor
than
water
which
makes
it
go
down
really
easy
this
a
beer
that
you
can
use
to
shotgun
or
chug
when
partying
hard
and
not
drinking
beer
for
the
taste
or
enjoyment
the
king
of
lites
is
just
an
easy
going
macro
offering
to
fill
the
fridge
with
beverage
light
yellow
with
a
forced
white
head
thats
outta
there
quickly
the
taste
is
malt
with
very
light
hopping
and
no
offensive
characteristics
except
its
thin
nature
watery
with
very
little
for
the
mouth
to
feel
millerlike
and
definitely
better
than
bud
i
asked
myself
should
i
even
review
this
and
let
it
out
that
i
even
drink
this
stuff
i
decided
that
i
should
if
only
to
remind
myself
of
the
true
meaning
of
quality
beer
and
the
importance
of
the
entire
experience
clear
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
foamy
white
head
something
i
remember
dreading
while
filling
up
at
a
keg
in
highschool
watery
of
course
yet
still
balanced
and
not
overly
bitter
not
bad
but
this
massproduced
massdirected
and
profitminded
brew
is
just
everything
it
is
made
to
be
and
most
of
what
i
look
to
avoid
attempting
to
be
gold
but
falls
short
and
lands
at
yellow
fizzy
with
all
of
the
artificial
carbonation
the
white
head
dissipates
very
quickly
this
is
the
silver
bullet
the
good
stuff
to
most
people
my
age
and
the
reason
why
most
people
my
age
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
corn
and
rice
sweetness
mixed
with
some
off
aromas
of
chemical
origin
the
flavor
is
as
close
to
an
artificial
beer
as
it
can
get
they
try
to
produce
malt
and
hops
but
this
beer
is
more
like
a
can
of
soda
than
a
beer
light
body
high
capacity
and
not
enjoyable
taste
the
rockies
well
for
me
never
again
in
this
life
time
there
are
always
these
for
the
taking
at
my
weekly
fri
card
games
so
when
im
done
my
beer
i
decided
to
grab
one
last
week
pours
a
clear
bright
pale
yellow
color
with
not
much
head
at
all
on
the
nose
the
aroma
is
fairly
clean
on
the
palate
the
flavor
what
flavor
there
is
is
slighty
bitter
nice
sweetness
as
it
warms
very
light
lemon
character
and
light
graininess
credit
where
credit
is
due
i
like
their
ads
during
the
football
game
hey
who
doesnt
like
those
twins
but
this
tasteless
beer
is
a
waste
of
time
and
money
no
taste
no
smell
no
point
to
it
just
expensive
water
and
you
can
buy
better
bottled
water
cheaper
a
bad
macrolight
useful
only
for
putting
out
fires
in
ashtrays
not
much
to
taste
or
smell
but
its
a
great
party
beer
that
can
be
drank
in
massive
quantities
without
too
many
digestive
problems
the
next
day
its
that
bad
straw
gold
color
with
a
quarterinch
offwhite
head
that
resembles
soap
lather
quite
aggressive
carbonation
with
streams
of
large
bubbles
sustains
the
head
quite
well
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
faint
washedout
hops
and
the
slightest
hint
of
skunk
tasting
yields
a
slight
sting
of
carbonation
less
than
expected
considering
the
furious
activity
in
the
glass
followed
by
slightly
sweet
flavors
and
some
weak
hop
bitterness
and
lingering
metallic
flavors
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
a
remarkably
insubstantial
beer
i
cant
believe
i
am
reviewing
coors
light
more
unbelievable
than
that
is
the
fact
that
i
am
reviewing
it
from
my
desk
at
work
the
christmas
party
justed
ended
and
i
am
waiting
for
the
whistle
to
blow
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
mild
light
taste
with
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
nothing
to
dislike
really
but
nothing
to
really
like
i
should
have
brought
in
my
own
beer
this
coors
light
that
i
downed
was
in
draught
form
and
brewed
under
licence
in
canada
it
had
a
much
fuller
body
than
i
had
anticipated
medium
golden
in
colour
well
balanced
with
low
carbonation
there
was
a
very
light
head
and
no
after
taste
i
enjoyed
it
i
do
like
the
nice
shiney
can
edit
this
review
was
written
when
the
overall
rating
was
called
drinkability
i
have
not
changed
my
score
for
this
but
in
no
way
do
i
feel
that
this
beer
merits
a
3
5
overall
this
is
worst
than
regular
coors
regular
coors
tasted
like
panther
piss
but
this
is
watered
down
delta
water
that
was
filtered
through
a
funnel
of
potable
water
how
could
anyone
drink
this
taste
buds
must
be
shot
to
hell
2
tastes
great
when
it
is
given
away
free
as
long
as
the
food
that
you
are
eating
hides
most
of
it
first
of
all
this
stuff
has
no
character
but
for
one
reason
or
another
my
friends
still
drink
it
the
color
is
pale
yellow
no
and
i
do
mean
no
carbonation
might
as
well
be
drinking
water
the
flavor
is
about
the
same
stagnant
pond
water
there
is
little
aroma
and
no
head
why
bother
the
label
is
even
ugly
i
cant
think
of
a
beer
i
dislike
more
it
truly
tastes
like
bitter
piss
water
i
made
the
mistake
of
drinking
this
at
a
tex
rangers
game
and
have
regretted
it
since
please
dont
claim
to
be
a
member
of
this
site
and
drink
this
beer
not
even
worthy
of
the
name
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
for
a
light
americanstyle
lager
it
has
a
pleasant
color
with
virtually
no
aroma
to
speak
of
it
does
have
some
light
bitterness
very
light
but
it
drinks
very
easily
the
mouthfeel
was
actually
better
than
many
other
light
beers
and
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
annoying
aftertaste
of
many
macros
it
is
a
good
refreshing
beer
to
drink
when
youre
dripping
with
sweat
after
cutting
the
lawn
and
a
couple
of
my
neighbors
rarely
drink
anything
but
coors
light
as
they
find
it
to
be
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
handful
at
a
time
not
my
favorite
style
beer
but
not
bad
for
what
it
is
a
light
macro
well
you
know
cheap
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
great
tasting
beer
light
body
no
head
plenty
of
corn
and
rice
though
for
cheap
shit
it
works
i
will
have
on
hand
for
my
friends
that
do
appricate
the
good
stuff
while
attending
a
wedding
it
seemed
that
the
only
beer
served
was
one
for
the
masses
it
was
hot
and
i
needed
something
cold
wet
to
cure
my
parchness
so
i
decided
to
have
a
cup
of
this
very
thin
yellowish
color
in
which
i
could
read
the
embossed
logo
on
the
bottom
of
the
cup
the
aroma
wasnt
anything
to
brag
about
the
taste
was
reasonable
but
i
think
being
parched
on
a
humid
day
helped
make
it
drinkable
not
something
id
pay
money
for
for
myself
anyway
a
light
beer
with
appeal
to
the
masses
and
done
well
for
what
it
is
there
is
not
a
lot
going
on
here
to
embellish
so
if
your
drinking
this
beer
because
you
like
it
then
enjoy
you
could
be
doing
worse
color
is
a
very
pale
yellow
one
of
the
lightest
white
head
does
not
last
long
at
all
the
body
and
mouthfeel
are
both
thin
clean
malt
aroma
and
flavor
i
agree
with
the
ads
the
only
thing
that
sets
coors
apart
from
the
other
wretched
light
beers
is
the
water
which
makes
it
crisp
and
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
but
why
bother
clear
very
pale
yellowish
color
one
of
the
lightest
of
the
lights
the
fluffy
bright
white
head
dies
immediately
the
body
is
thin
the
mouthfeel
is
also
thin
but
with
a
gentle
caress
of
fine
bubbles
from
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
very
clean
slight
malt
aroma
clean
light
malt
flavor
light
and
brief
what
it
lacks
in
flavor
it
makes
up
for
in
lack
of
color
thats
a
joke
somewhat
refreshing
at
least
its
somewhat
something
oddly
enough
this
one
was
even
worse
out
of
the
keg
an
odor
that
almost
made
me
throw
it
away
started
it
off
then
a
skunky
bitter
taste
with
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
on
the
way
down
it
is
sure
a
good
thing
i
had
some
good
brews
with
me
and
i
didnt
have
to
fight
coors
lite
down
all
night
one
of
the
lightest
light
beers
on
the
market
pale
sickly
gold
hue
white
head
no
lace
undistinguishable
nose
beyond
the
light
grainyhusk
sweet
ditto
on
the
palate
watery
polluted
with
adjuncts
undrinkable
and
unnecessary
far
too
many
better
light
beers
is
than
an
oxymoron
can
be
had
pass
on
coors
light
the
next
time
you
see
it
this
is
nothing
a
ba
would
drink
often
i
mean
ever
i
had
this
beer
over
the
recent
holiday
weekend
i
dont
think
ive
tasted
it
in
many
years
its
a
pale
clear
straw
color
with
a
shallow
head
no
aroma
no
beer
flavors
at
all
very
watery
a
miserable
beer
i
guess
if
you
held
a
gun
to
my
head
and
made
me
choose
an
american
lite
this
would
be
it
i
mean
if
sam
adams
stopped
making
theirs
i
agree
that
this
is
a
good
chick
beer
much
like
any
other
light
beer
it
serves
a
purpose
and
what
that
purpose
is
i
have
no
idea
this
is
not
too
terribly
undrinkable
but
the
aroma
and
appearance
as
well
as
flavor
leave
a
bit
to
be
desired
worth
the
pain
to
drink
if
you
are
calorieconscious
ahh
the
legendary
silver
bullet
there
are
so
many
nasty
things
i
could
say
but
i
dont
want
to
be
crude
at
least
not
right
now
this
is
not
a
beer
it
is
so
bad
that
if
the
drafters
of
the
rheinheitsgebot
had
nuclear
capability
golden
colorado
would
be
one
huge
radioactive
crater
weak
adjuncty
applejuicy
tasting
underhopped
and
generally
insipid
as
a
water
beverage
it
is
very
nice
it
actually
kinda
tastes
a
bit
like
beer
what
the
hell
is
with
this
beer
light
almost
waterlike
color
almost
no
smell
smells
like
seltzer
water
with
a
cooked
veggie
characteristic
that
transfers
to
the
taste
spritzy
and
watery
with
a
strong
sweet
adjunct
funk
after
drinking
some
munchen
helles
all
weekend
and
then
drinking
this
i
had
to
dump
it
out
instead
of
drinking
this
just
drink
water
free
at
golf
tournament
today
i
probably
have
had
hundreds
of
these
over
the
years
before
i
knew
good
beer
existed
not
much
i
can
say
that
others
have
not
already
stated
straw
like
color
white
fizzy
head
some
grain
like
smells
taste
was
very
dull
bland
watery
and
overly
sweet
no
real
solid
hops
malt
or
any
other
beerlike
qualities
i
barely
consider
this
a
beer
anymore
why
am
i
even
bothering
mostly
just
because
i
am
offended
for
consuming
this
garbage
i
only
wish
that
the
rating
were
lower
than
1
0
i
would
rather
drink
tap
water
than
this
the
only
reason
this
beer
is
popular
is
the
advertising
coors
does
the
silver
bullet
is
a
complete
dud
extreame
pale
lager
yellow
in
color
with
a
surprisingly
decent
look
in
the
glass
no
taste
to
speak
of
only
mountain
water
right
slight
malt
finish
but
no
character
at
all
the
true
ladies
beer
i
had
to
give
this
a
high
drinkablity
because
i
do
drink
a
lot
of
water
yes
this
is
light
and
it
has
a
funky
somewhat
bizarre
soapy
taste
to
it
if
there
are
hops
in
here
they
are
well
hidden
if
it
were
90
degrees
outside
and
there
were
no
water
or
other
beer
available
pours
a
pale
pale
gold
with
absolutely
no
head
i
cant
get
any
smell
off
it
whatsoever
taste
is
extremely
watered
down
just
like
the
body
i
may
be
imagining
things
but
it
seems
like
i
can
taste
the
faintest
of
malt
flavor
in
it
it
is
like
rolling
soda
water
across
your
mouth
but
it
is
pretty
drinkable
this
beer
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
someone
took
a
perfectly
good
bottle
of
kolsch
or
blonde
ale
and
poured
it
into
a
gallon
of
water
it
really
wouldnt
be
half
bad
for
a
party
except
that
it
takes
at
least
1
5
x
as
much
of
this
stuff
as
it
does
any
other
beer
if
i
am
going
to
go
cheap
i
at
least
want
something
that
is
going
to
give
me
a
buzz
by
the
time
i
kill
the
six
pack
you
can
pound
em
all
night
long
and
still
think
you
can
drive
until
the
prehangover
kicks
in
and
causes
oncoming
headlights
to
feel
like
high
intensity
laser
beams
just
a
prelude
to
how
your
head
will
feel
in
the
morning
if
you
choose
to
drink
enough
of
it
to
finally
achieve
a
solid
buzz
but
then
why
else
would
you
drink
it
i
usually
avoid
light
beers
like
the
plague
but
when
your
thirsty
and
theyre
free
i
guess
you
gotta
drink
up
i
dont
care
what
slight
flavors
you
may
discern
if
you
think
long
and
hard
enough
about
them
this
beer
is
crap
it
swills
down
easy
and
quenches
accordingly
but
is
your
image
really
going
to
be
elevated
if
you
drink
the
silver
bullet
yuk
this
is
proof
positive
that
advertising
does
pay
why
else
would
anyone
buy
this
crap
it
has
a
very
watery
taste
with
a
hint
of
skunk
i
think
odouls
is
closer
to
being
beer
than
this
uh
beverage
i
almost
called
it
a
beer
oops
this
is
not
beer
thats
right
its
beerflavored
carbonated
water
with
minimal
alcohol
content
suitable
for
fratboys
jocks
bennies
thats
a
nj
term
for
the
hip
summer
crowd
that
invades
the
shore
every
year
and
other
party
animals
who
think
this
crap
actually
tastes
good
how
coors
manages
to
move
so
much
of
this
garbage
amazes
me
when
i
used
to
work
in
a
liquor
store
case
upon
case
of
this
overcarbonated
urine
would
fly
out
of
the
store
theres
no
accounting
for
bad
taste
i
suppose
the
saying
to
each
his
own
applies
here
very
watery
one
could
argue
whether
this
should
actually
be
referred
to
as
beer
its
more
like
carbonated
water
mmm
beer
or
more
accurately
quasi
beercolored

dont
waste
your
time

not
much
else
taste
is
malts
grains
some
crackers
more
flavor
than
most

beers
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
just
lager
no
more
12
oz
bottle
o
this
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
quite
flavorful
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
especially
since
you
cannot
taste
any
adjunct
malts
abita
light
for
when
you
want
a
light
beer
but
dont
wanna
look
bad
amongst
the
craft
beer
glitterati
id
use
it
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
what
may
or
may
not
be
grass
and
flowers
its
all
decidedly
evanescent
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
slightly
sweeter
biscuit
character
and
a
flower
component
thats
almost
completely
detectable
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
an
okay
little
thing
better
than
other
light
lagers
out
there
however
much
that
says
but
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
abitas
light
beer
is
definitely
steps
above
your
normal
light
macros
while
im
not
a
huge
light
beer
fan
i
try
to
grade
to
style
as
much
as
i
can
this
one
is
definitely
worth
it
if
you
want
an
easydrinking
lowcalorie
lawnmower
beer
for
what
it
is
and
strives
to
be
it
does
a
fantastic
job
for
a
light
beer
i
dont
think
it
gets
much
better
m
a
bit
watery
taste
has
a
pleasant
hop
flavor
that
is
pretty
damn
nice
floral
almost
graininess
is
there
but
oh
so
faint
this
beer
tastes
light
a
light
macro
without
the
grimacing
twang
usually
associated
with
such
its
quite
good
for
a
light
lager
but
it
really
does
not
have
much
actual
flavor
if
you
were
a
light
beer
drinker
and
money
was
no
object
this
beer
is
for
you
personally
i
dont
think
the
price
difference
between
this
and
a
rack
of
stones
is
close
enough
to
justify
purchasing
on
a
regular
basis
if
pounding
light
beers
is
what
youre
into
12oz
bottle
pours

with
a
lasting
white
head
and
soda
like

nose
is
light
herbal
hops
and
sweet
biscuit
malt
light
very
crisp
body
light
hops
sweet
malt
combine
on
the
palate
light
finish
not
a
bad
brew
for
a
light
beer
but
it
is
still
a
light
beer
abita
light
pours
to
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
medium
sized
spritzy
head
formation
and
a
faint
touch
of
malt
in
the
nose
there
is
a
very
light
amount
of
malt
in
the
palate
along
with
a
faint
hint
of
the
creamy
nutty
flavor
found
in
abita
amber
the
beer
is
fairly
clean
overall
and
benefits
from
the
lack
of
adjunct
flavors
unfortunately
the
flavors
here
are
too
light
for
my
taste
in
the
finish
a
very
subtle
kiss
of
hops
is
barely
perceptible
the
beer
finishes
on
the
watery
side
overall
my
new
favorite
in
the
style
and
i
do
like
this
beer
this
is
way
better
than
bmc
and
sam
adams
this
does
have
way
more
flavor
than
most
in
this
style
and
would
be
one
to
reach
for
in
hotter
weather
i
tried
scoring
this
to
style
so
as
a
beer
overall
take
off
roughly
5
in
each
category
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
barley
and
maybe
pale
malts
tastes
of
malts
a
strange
hop
bitterness
that
flows
away
quickly
and
some
bread
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
okay
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
head
has
good
retention
kind
of
a
musty
smell
i
may
even
smell
some
grassy
and
spicy
hops
which
is
nice
for
the
style
pale
malts
and
grains
in
the
flavor
hint
of
a
spicy
hop
bitterness
but
it
is
faint
weird
dry
aftertaste
hey
a
light
lager
with
flavor
it
can
be
done
light
bodied
with
good
lively
carbonation
for
a
light
lager
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
sam
adams
is
my
favorite
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
rjt
d
overall
a
pretty
good
light
beer
another
good
beer
from
abita
d
as
far
as
light
lagers
go
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
especially
drinkable
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
most
macros
would
be
even
easier
ot
throw
back
overall
it
was
on
the
watery
side
but
thats
to
be
expected
for
a
light
beer
much
better
than
a
bud
light
and
to
me
a
very
above
average
light
beer
not
much
here
could
be
mixed
in
with
so
many
other
light
lagers
could
be
a
quick
thirstquencher
in
the
heat
but
so
could
so
many
others
its

this

better
than
the

went
well
with
my

overall
a
decent
light
beer
better
than
a

not

with
sam
light
pours
a
pale

a

smell
is
virtually

maybe
a

but
not
much
a
very

watereddown
taste
with
no
real
kicker
i
cant
really
come
up
with
a
suitable
reason
to
drink
this
beer
while
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
theres
nothing
at
all
that
stands
out
about
this
selection
from
abita
overall
a
beer
that
poses
as
a
microbrew
but
has
no
true
distinction
from
most
commercial
light
beers
this
beer
was
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
suprisingly
drinkable
give
it
a
try
aroma
what
aroma
none
to
speak
of
flavor
light
malts
light
hops
very
inoffensive
but
it
really
was
lacking
in
both
it
went
down
smoothly
clena
and
refreshing
and
it
was
superior
to
the
bud
light
that
predominated
the
festivities
but
i
tried
it
moving
on
clear
pale
gold
with
a
small
white
foamy
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
wisps
of
film
some
light
lacing
smells
of
grain
with
some
very
light
grassy
hops
and
a
corny
funk
hmmm
the
taste
is
crisp
and
rather
corny
man
i
expected
more
from
abita
than
a
very
macrolike
light
beer
however
it
does
finish
remarkably
clean
and
is
quite
refreshing
so
as
far
as
light
beers
go
its
not
actually
all
that
bad
not
terrible
but
nothing
all
that
good
either
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
cap
smell
was
almost
non
existent
with
lightly
sweetness
and
grain
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
lightly
sweet
with
a
slight
more
than
expected
bitterness
not
much
else
besides
that
carbonation
was
high
with
light
body
refreshing
beer
overall
i
dont
like
what
abita
and
some
other
micro
breweries
are
doing
by
making
a
light
beer
instead
they
can
make
an
ipa
but
i
totally
understand
what
they
are
doing
and
thats
fine
this
is
never
one
i
get
a
six
pack
for
but
for
what
it
is
it
aint
bad
considering
the
range
of
light
beers
from
microbreweries
this
isnt
a
bad
one
though
theres
little
that
stands
out
about
it
very
pale
yellow
with
a
flufy
head
a
little
honey
sweetness
in
the
aroma
light
flavor
with
some
honey
a
slight
spiciness
made
this
seem
like
a
lightly
flavored
hefeweizen
almost
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
i
was
a
little
skeptical
with
this
but
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
this
would
make
a
pretty
nice
beer
to
enjoy
a
few
in
the
summer
heat
by
the
pool
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
musty
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
has
a
light
and
grainy
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
slightly
dry
and
musty
it
tastes
better
than
some
macro
brews
but
thats
not
saying
much
micro
breweries
shouldnt
waste
their
time
with
these
beers
unless
theyre
going
to
add
something
special
to
the
taste
ala
sam
adams
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
i
still
dont
get
the
point
here
if
i
wanted
a
light
lager
id
drink
michelob
ultra
its
one
and
done
for
me
now
i
cannot
get
through
a
macro
light
like
coors
or
miller
just
awful
so
really
this
isnt
bad
for
the
style
not
the
most
drinkable
light
beers
are
just
not
drinkable
to
me
this
doesnt
taste
as
dishwatery
as
the
others
though
not
something
i
need
to
drink
but
in
the
future
when
my
gut
crosses
the
border
of
another
state
i
will
revisit
whats
up
with
that
nothin
much
that
i
know
of
if
lightness
in
texture
body
and
everything
is
your
aim
this
is
your
ticket
but
because
of
that
count
me
out
notes
very
overcarbonated
and
almost
tasteless
brew
perhaps
the
only
light
beer
not
to
get
worse
as
you
drink
it
poured
a
perfctly
clear
yellow
in
color
slight
head
that
vanished
altogether
no
nose
but
its
not
supposed
to
have
one
either
flavor
is
slightly
malty
with
bits
of
maize
hinting
around
the
edges
not
much
to
this
beer
but
definitely
one
of
the
more
drinkable
light
lagers
i
have
ever
drank
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp

hop
bitterness
is
mild
but
hard
to
really
tell
due
to
excessive
carbonation
light

so
heavily

the

acrid

that
form

im
going
to
swirl
to
release
some

and
have
another
go
at
the
final
half
of
the
glass
okay
now
its
pretty
much
a
flat
version
of
the
earlier
beer
the
sweetness
stands
a
bit
stronger
and
the
hop
flavor
has
faded
a
bit
although
the
hop
flavor
is
not
as
intense
i
find
it

its

for

these

she
merely
nodded
and
said
not

when
i
offered
her
this
beer
notes

i
am
reviewing
this
as
a
light
beer
not
in
line
with
my
opinion
of
beers
in
said
style
it
leaves
a
sweet
corny
aftertaste
that
is
not
all
that
pleasant
its
a
noble
effort
and
i
would
much
rather
pop
a
sammy
light
still
wondering
why
this
beer
is
top
rated
the

of

from

light
was
poured
from
the
stubby
brown
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
in
which
it
looked
pale
golden
clear
and
fizzy
the
aroma
was
very
mild
and
mostly
grains
and
malt
with
some
lemony
yeastiness
the
flavor
was
much
better
than
most
light
beers
had
a

comments

i
know
this
style
is
poopooed
by
most
and
im
certainly
not
a
big
fan
of
light
american
lagers
having
said
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
that
ive
had
i
owe
a
big
thanks
to
biglove
for
sending
me
this
gem
this
is
very
good
for
a
light
lager
im
assuming
this
is
because
it
isnt
an
adjunct
light
lager
or
at
the
very
least
adjuncts
dont
play
a
large
role
in
the
making
of
abita
light
smell
is
clean
and
grainy
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
color
is
yellow
but
less
watery
than
most
lights
head
is
about
what
is
expected
for
the
style
taste
is
grainy
no
adjunct
tastes
here
this
is
very
crisp
and
smooth
i
would
pick
this
as
a
good
lawnmower
beer
grainy
smell
and
flavor
very
crisp
better
than
many
common
nonlight
lagers
abita
has
entered
the
light
beer
world
and
theyve
done
a
good
job
brown
twistoff
bottle
freshness
date
notched
on
the
back
label
freshness
wasnt
an
issue
as
i
had
it
in
new
orleans
the
same
month
it
was
released
i
was
told
they
had
been
testing
recipes
for
a
light
beer
for
two
years
its
color
is
perhaps
a
bit
more
amber
than
most
light
lagers
and
that
reflects
in
the
taste
its
richer
and
more
full
than
your
average
light
beer
only
119
calories
but
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
dont
believe
most
beer
drinkers
would
think
it
was
a
light
abita
uses
no
adjuncts
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
trip
there
so
i
can
do
the
brewery
tour
again
and
ask
some
more
questions
about
this
beer
but
i
think
abita
is
going
to
be
very
successful
with
it
nice
for
its
niche
light
beers
but
very
bland
and
boring
rjt
owhat
you
would
expect
from
a
light
beer
from
becks
it
was
okay
still
becks
premier
lights
mildness
and
hoppy
nose
are
refreshing
enough
to
recommend
it
to
those
of
us
who
enjoy
sipping
very
light
lagers
on
hot
summer
evenings
the
beer
is
aboveaverage
as
far
as
very
light
lagers
go
and
as
long
as
you
dont
let
the
nose
fool
you
you
wont
be
disappointed
no
real
head
to
speak
of
on
a
straw
clear
body
aroma
is
very
mild
and
is
your
typical
light
pale
hopless
malt
nose
flavor
is
watery
with
pale
malts
and
slight
bitterness
showing
up
in
the
finish
super
light
body
and
high
carbonation
and
as
refreshing
as
water
overall
low
expectations
for
which
i
wasnt
surprised
or
disappointed
in
the
outcome
o
buy
this
as
you
would
miller
light
bud
light
or
coors
light
becks
light
is
not
a
very
good
off
shoot
of
becks
regular
the
beer
pours
golden
clear
with
decent
head
and
corbonation
to
start
both
which
fade
rapidly
the
smell
is
grainbarley
and
pilsner
hops
the
taste
is
sharp
pilsner
hops
strike
first
then
a
slight
balance
of
malt
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
because
of
the
very
light
body
which
is
good
if
it
is
a
hot
afternoon
overall
it
is
a
better
than
bud
light
average
beer
o
its
a
light
beer
what
can
one
honestly
expect
i
suppose
it
might
not
be
all
that
bad
after
a
day
of
hard
labor
but
even
then
i
think
id
stick
with
something
a
little
more
substantial
pours
a
clear
and
very
pale
golden
color
there
is
only
bits
of
a
head
to
it
scent
is
that
of
cheap
grassy
grains
the
taste
at
least
has
some
flavor
to
it
but
not
very
much
the
taste
is
very
grassy
and
drinks
like
water
no
texture
at
all
and
essentially
drinks
like
beer
flavored
water
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
that
at
least
its
better
than
mgd
64
overall
i
dont
want
to
punish
this
beer
for
being
of
a
style
i
dont
much
care
for
i
want
to
punish
it
for
being
quite
bad
in
short
it
stinks
and
fails
to
taste
like
beer
12

while

the
brew
definitely
has
a
taste
because
it
differs
from
water
quite
a
disgusting
drink
easily
it
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tried
at
least
i
did
not
buy
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
some
carbonation
with
a
small
fizzy
white

the

is
grainy

is
slightly
sweet
grainy
and
ricy
light
body
not
much
going
on
with
this
one
another
pretty
poor
try
at
a
beer
was
a
drain
pour
the
pour
was
about
what
i
would
have
expected
with
a
thin
amber
color
to
it
if
you
could
really
call
it
amber
in
any
way
lots
of
fizzy
white
foam
coming
up
through
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
reach
about
an
inch
before
dropping
back
down
and
not
leaving
any
bit
of
lacing
what
so
ever
aroma
is
light
grains
musky
and
full
of
moldy
bready
notes
nothing
you
would
really
want
to
go
around
bragging
about
in
any
way
clean
and
crisp
it
made
for
a
good
water
substitute
but
again
that
was
about
it
as
it
really
just
had
very
little
flavor
to
it
at
all
wet
hay
maybe
and
a
light
touch
of
corn
but
nothing
really
from
a
bottle

i
did
not
look
at
the
date
when
i
bought
it
it
was
in
a
closeout
rack
now
i
know
why
still
it
pours
a
very
carbonated
yellow
like
it
should
the
aroma
has
a
skunky
maltiness
to
it
but
nothing
special
the
mouthfeel
is
like
water
and
the
taste
is
bready
and
grainy
a
typical
la
overall
id
imagine
there
would
be
better
choices
than
this
foamy

smell
is
a

flavors
of

and
skunk
i
think
i
run
into
a
bad

and
will
rate
again
later
mouthfeel
is
very

i
think
i
could
have
another
if
i
were
really
drunk
but
i
will
not
have
another
until
i
re

quite
faint
with
some
miniscule
amount
of
grassy
floral

in
the

alongside
a
faint
grain
presence
grassy
and
grainy
flavors
dominate
what
is
a
really
really
faint
bodyyou
can
really
tell
from
the
taste
that
not
much
went
into
this
brew
feel
is
light
and
prickly
goes
down
quite
smoothly
and
is
better
than
its
american
comparisons
in
that
it
actually
would
be
preferable
to
carbonated
water
at
least
for
me
drinkability
as
with
most
light
beers
you
could
keep
going
back
to
this
one
in
the
fridge
as
much
as
you
want
because
the
taste
and
filling
quality
just
isnt
there
nor
is
any
kind
of
complexity
a
little
better
than
most
light
beers
ive
tried
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
terrible
i
get
a
lot
of
corn
and
something
that
smells
like
an
ashtray
the
flavor
is
just
as
bad
if
not
worse
heavy
on
the
adjuncts
with
no
hops
at
all
light
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
absolutely
awful
mfd
watery
and
lacking
any
real
flavor
or
characther
i
guess
it
is
what
it
is
even
if
your
trying
to
be
good
while
dieting
im
sure
there
are
better
options
out
there
you
could
certainly
suck
down
a
lot
of
these
quickly
due
to
the
thin
mouthfeel
low
abv
and
low
flavor
think
about
cutting
a
light
beer
with
tonic
water
and
then
having
a
chugging
contest
that
would
be
some
kind
of
drinkable
right
at
half
the
strength
of
regular
becks
i
took
the
liberty
to
dilute
such
in
half
this
beer
surely
exceeds
that
mixture
and
isnt
nearly
as
watered
down
as
others
would
imply
still
a
thin
beer
yet
not
unexpected
in
body
my
brother
left
this
in
the
fridge
when
he
was
here
visiting
let
me
say
i
hate
light
beer
to
begin
with
but
this
stuff
was
god
awful
and
for
some
people
to
compare
this
to
a
nice
glass
of
water
clean
your
faucets
water
is
way
better
then
this
mess
only
good
thing
i
can
say
is
the
becks
labal
always
looks
nice
next
time
i
drink
becks
it
will
be
oktoberfest
or
becks
dark
pours
very
light
straw
color
half
inch

faded
as
quickly
as
the
beer
was
poured
with
no

like
a

dry
grainy
corn
husk
slight

note
mouthfeel
was

tight
crisp
not
worth
the
money
pass
by
this
one
d
i
wonder
if
this
actually
beat
miller
to
the
64
calorie
beer
either
way
its
still
too
much
water
has
0
calories
and
so
should
this
beer
cause
water
is
essentially
all
it
is
not
offensive
in
any
way
because
there
is
almost
nothing
there
to
create
offense
about
a
half
of
a
finger
of
head
which
quickly
dies
some
good
bubble
action
too
light
golden
color
the
nose
was
the
typicaly
euroskunk
taste
was
bitter
but
watery
in
the
mouth
this
beer
started
out
ok
with
the
look
and
smell
but
kind
of
dies
when
you
drink
it
hey
but
what
do
you
want
for
64
calories
and
2
3
abv
a
good
beer
to
have
if
your
not
drinking
for
the
night
d
extremely
drinkable
great
thirst
quencher
i
didnt
notice
any
serious
off
flavors
and
it
goes
down
easy
something
to
drink
without
thinking
about
it
i
am
drinking
a
smuttynose
ipa
as
i
type
this
so
cant
we
all
just
get
along
i
always
find
light
beer
to
be
an
adventure
although
not
necessarily
for
the
better
i
just
wanted
to
see
how
this
would
taste
given
its
calorie
count
this
bad
but
not
in
the
this
tastes
like
piss
sense
theres
just
nothing
here
that
includes
offtastes
and
regular
taste
i
would
pick
it
over
bmc
light
beers
however
as
it
seems
as
though
hops
were
at
least
within
20
feet
of
the
kettle
mouthfeel
super
light
and
a
very
misty
feeling
in
the
mouthaftertaste
very
drinkable
i
guess
compares
to
water
as
far
as
mouthfeel
is
concerned
incredibly
light
a
neighbors
friend
gave
me
a
bottle
of
this
one
bottle
was
enough
12oz
green
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
straw
colored
yellow
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
the
grain
a
touch
of
euro
skunkiness
and
faint
spicy
hops
the
taste
is
very
dry
with
faint
grain
and
hop
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
watery
side
due
to
the
low
abv
and
very
prickly
due
to
the
high
carbonation
overall
not
a
horrible
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summers
day
when
you
really
dont
want
to
drink
a
beer
with
much
alcohol
content
but
for
most
instances
i
will
grab
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
wow
not
what
i
expected
i
expected
a
light
beer
with
at
least
some
flavor
this
is
the
most
watered
down
beer
ive
ever
tasted
in
my
life
the
taste
isnt
bad
its
just
nonexistant
totally
nonexistant
and
the
beer
actually
smells
like
tap
water
with
a
hint
of
malt
clear
golden
yellow
water
with
some
bubbles
thats
all
this
is
what
a
waste
of
7
99
i
feel
like
such
a
sucker
for
buying
this
wow
did
someone
really
make
a
2
5
beer
on
purpose
wow
my
roommates
ex
left
one
in
the
fridge
so
thought
id
crack
it
open
and
review
it
umm
where
to
start
two
fingers
worth
of
head
that
disappeared
quickly
no
lacing
smell
is
very
musty
like
a
beer
glass
left
over
night
at
the
night
club
as
far
as
taste
well
there
really
isnt
one
comes
down
just
like
club
soda
almost
very
little
taste
no
mouth
feel
but
leaves
that
carbonation
tingle
in
the
throat
i
cant
imagine
ever
drinking
this
again
and
i
wont
even
be
finishing
this
one
dcould
drink
alot
but
with
such
a
abv
of
2
3
it
would
not
get
me
fair
if
you
have
to
drink
low
calorie
here
ya
go

otherwise
get
the
real
deal
this
will
be
a
short
review
mainly
because
this
beer
is
so
short
on
actual
flavor
this
is
so
close
to
water
that
i
was
tempted
to
put
it
on
ice
no
kidding
becks
managed
to
combine
the
poor
flavor
of
a
nonalcoholic
beer
with
the
shortness
of
flavor
of
a
light
beer
i
am
not
one
for
knocking
a
beer
but
this
stuff
is
down
right
bad
the
appearance
is
an
unattractive
one
weak
head
and
next
to
no
color
smell
is
not
noteworthy
by
any
means
nor
the
flavor
if
your
looking
for
a
light
beer
look
elsewhere
i
can
believe
the
calorie
rating
on
this
its
one
step
above
carbonated
water
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
little
head
retention
smell
is
of
honey
mixing
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
mellow
and
crisp
sweet
with
a
slight
dry
flavor
profile
in
the
end
very
clean
flavor
and
refreshing
a
great
beer
when
you
only
want
to
chill
and
have
one
very
pale
in
color
with
no
head
if
any
typical
cooked
cornsyrupy
aroma
thats
somewhat
sweet
taste
is
much
of
the
same
except
that
its
almost
bland
and
seltzerlike
not
sure
if
this
can
be
called
beer
but
i
guess
i
could
put
it
a
bit
above
typical
american
light
lagers
im
not
entirely
sure
that
this
qualifies
as
beer
per
se
the
most
distinctive
characteristic
is
definitely
seltzer
and
colleagues
of
the
coors
light
labatts
set
that
magic
number
64

is
apparently
as
magical

kind
of
skunky
and
altogether
unpleasant
i
didnt
realize
until
now
that
this
was

beer
i
cant
really
imagine
who
the
intended
market
is
for
this
but
it
tastes
significantly
better
than
any
other

beer

at
all
and
wont
try
it
again
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
overall
i
was
completely
blown
away
by
how
bad
this
was
i
didnt
expect
this
beer
to
be
that
bad
i
think
it
is
in
the
same
class
as
coors
light
only
thing
i
like
about
this
beer
is
after
6
you
dont
feel
bloated
gives
a
strange
buzz
though
only
64
calories
what
can
you
expext
i
didnt
hate
this
one
i
actually
prefer
the
sharp
green
bottle
skunkiness
of
beers
like
this
and
heineken
to
american
brews
like
bud
light
and
coors
light
which
have
even
less
flavor
i
certainly
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
but
it
did
the
trick
when
it
was
the
only
option
and
accompanied
a
freshly
grilled
backyard
burger
on
a
sunny
afternoon
i
wanted
to
refrain
from
any
term
that
sounds
like
skunky
but
i
cant
will
store
the
rest
if
the
12
pack
and
one
day
this
may
come
in
handy
but
not
in
the
foreseeable
future
i
hope
becks
light
is
not
a
very
good
off
shoot
of
becks
regular
the
beer
pours
golden
clear
with
decent
head
and
corbonation
to
start
both
which
fade
rapidly
the
smell
is
grainbarley
and
pilsner
hops
the
taste
is
sharp
pilsner
hops
strike
first
then
a
slight
balance
of
malt
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
because
of
the
very
light
body
which
is
good
if
it
is
a
hot
afternoon
overall
it
is
a
better
than
bud
light
average
beer
o
not
a
good
light
lager
even
by
light
lager
standards
taste
slight
bitterness
more
water
this
seems
like
it
was
made
for
a
yuppie
guy
who
doesnt
like
beer
but
wants
to
appear
at
least
a
little
bit
exotic
in
his
choices
water
water
everywhere
and
not
a
drop
to
drink
a
smidge
of
saaz
hops
id
guess
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
white
foamy
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
grainy
ricyvery
slight
hop
note
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
grainyricy
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
much
going
on
with
this
one
okay
only
reason
im
rating
this
as
good
is
if
you
want
to
go
ahead
and
drink
light
beer
then
it
better
do
what
it
says
on
the
label
64
calories
folks
64
what
do
you
expect
bud
55
is
awful
and
mgd
64
is
meh
miller
lite
clocks
in
at
96
cals
and
is
probably
your
best
bang
for
your
light
buck
but
if
you
truly
are
counting
cals
then
pop
open
a
becks
light
ive
been
on
a
health
kick
lately
and
still
enjoy
the
real
stuff
but
if
cutting
cals
from
your
diet
while
still
being
able
to
drink
some
beer
pick
this
over
bud
light
coors
light
amstel
light
miller
light
sam
light
whatever
light
poured
a
dull
straw
yellow
with
a
big
white
fizzy
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
but
the
fizzy
yellow
water
type
no
lace
the
smell
was
very
faint
if
there
at
all
what
i
could
pick
up
was
maybe
a
hay
or
wheat
smell
again
very
very
faint
and
hardly
there
at
all
the
taste
was
very
light
and
non
descript
but
that
is
about
what
one
would
expect
from
a
light
lager
a
light
grain
just
enough
of
a
taste
to
know
i
was
not
drinking
water
would
be
the
best
way
to
describe
it
decent
feel
again
just
the
cold
well
carbonated
crisp
and
a
clean
finish
no
aftertaste
overall
this
was
totally
forgettable
as
i
imagined
it
would
be
their
version
of
bud
light
i
imagine
and
if
thats
the
case
it
is
spot
on
nothing
to
see
here
move
along
people
an
unimpressive
straw
yellow
beer
with
a
fizzy
head
that
fades
fast
and
leaves
little
lace
it
smells
of
skunk
urine
grass
and
mineral
water
over
carbonated
watery
and
skunky
beer
not
something
you
want
to
put
in
your
mouth
fail
the
beer
is
very
watered
down
light
struck
a
touch
of
citrus
hay
grain
grass
and
mineral
water
not
tasty
at
all
d
very
drinkable
but
i
think
water
would
be
healthier
and
better
pretty
good
for
a
lighter
beer
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
lower
quality
heineken
i
think
it
is
a
little
too
heavily
carbonated
and
seems
a
little
like
an
alcoholic
sprite
the
carbonation
definitely
overrides
any
truly
distinctive
flavor
in
the
beer
poured
from
a
green
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
a
bit
on
the
skunky
side
taste
is
crisp
a
touch
of
malts
and
hops
slightly
sweet
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
not
bad
as
far
as
light
beers
go
hey
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
beer
and
i
mean
light
64
calories
this
one
is
not
bad
now
mgd
64
is
bad
this
is
64
calorie
good
t
its
really
like
a
slightly
flavored
water
thats
not
to
be
oh
its
a
crappy
light
beer
and
i
hate
light
beer
or
anything
its
just
like
a
skunked
version
of
water
i
have
found
this
website
to
be
very
useful
i
should
have
read
some
reviews
about
this
beer
before
buying
first
off
im
not
a
fan
of
becks
to
begin
with
i
really
dont
know
why
i
bought
this
beer
maybe
to
much
time
in
the
sun
i
purchased
a
six
pack
only
5
99
not
to
bad
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
zero
head
almost
crystal
clear
apperance
taste
not
much
of
a
taste
the
only
thing
i
could
say
is
it
is
better
than
coors
light
and
miller
light
but
that
is
not
saying
much
hmmm
becks
light
what
good
can
be
said
about
it
well
its
only
64
calories
and
therefore
not
filling
and
goes
down
just
about
as
easy
as
water
so
you
can
drink
a
ton
all
night
however
the
pale
yellow
appearance
with
fizzy
thin
white
head
is
very
underwhelming
the
taste
has
just
slightly
more
character
than
a
coors
light
that
probably
best
sums
up
this
beer
i
drank
the
beer
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
just
wanted
to
get
it
over
i
will
never
drink
it
again
if
given
the
chance
truly
a
becks
light
has
all
the
taste
and
aroma
of
the
original
just
watered
down
pours
light
yellow
with
a
bubbly
white
head
sweet
yet
light
malt
and
saaz
aroma
bitter
becks
taste
with
more
water
according
to
my
wife
and
the
commercial
description
this
is
the
lowestcalorie
beer
out
there
i
have
to
say
it
this
is
really
not
that
bad
for
a
light
beer
the
first
time
i
tasted
this
beer
i
recoiled
probably
one
of
the
worst
i
have
had
very
bad
for
its
style
this
was
a
waste
of
my
time
poured
an
almost
clear
pale
gold
with
a
decent
head
that
receeded
quickly
and
left
little
lace
patches
rather
metallic
and
morning
dew
like
smell
read
cheap
beer
smell
watery
and
thin
and
like
wet
grass
there
is
very
little
to
like
about
this
beer
it
is
bland
and
doesnt
even
go
down
smooth
because
of
some
ripe
hopness
on
the
backend
had
one
will
not
have
two
drinkability
i
wish
i
hadnt
bought
a
whole
sixer
of
this
stuff
oh
well
i
have
lots
of
yard
work
to
do
ill
actually
say
its
less
drinkable
than
the
ultra
scored
some
6s
for
3
99
and
thats
why
i
bought
it
a
good
drink
when
you
want
the
beer
taste
without
the
alcohol
notes
the
worse
beer
i
have
taste
from
this
brewery
and
one
of
the
bottom
5
of
all
my
life
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
because
they
are
not
filling
at
all
and
go
down
easy
ill
buy
this
again
p
this
beer
pours
clear
extremely
pale
yellow
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
very
weakbut
you
can
pick
out
a
small
skunky
aroma
and
little
else
the
taste
is
very
thin
and
watery
with
just
abit
of
malt
and
hops
present
the
mf
is
weak
and
thin
with
almost
no
flavor
i
know
this
is
a
light
beerbut
how
about
alittle
flavor
if
i
wanted
a
water
id
have
bought
a
poland
springs
color
is
a
barelyyellow
sortof
beer
color
aroma
is
skunky
and
unappealing
flavor
is
that
same
skunky
methyl
butyl
thiol
compoun
this
is
simply
not
good
beer
light
or
otherwise
drinkability
probably
nice
on
a
hot
day
but
what
beer
isnt
64
calories
per
beer
is
its
best
quality
because
i
could
fall
into
the
beer
cooler
at
any
grocery
store
and
find
a
beer
as
good
heres
the
best
part
of
this
beer
i
think
i
lost
weight
frinking
it
at
64
calores
and
very
few
carbs
its
a
nice
alternative
to
slim
fast
other
than
that
id
rather
drink
a
miller
lite
easy
to
finish
but
did
not
make
you
want
to
drink
another
had
one
of
these
to
wash
down
some
food
was
very
surprised
at
the
overall
experience
the
appearance
was
nothing
to
speak
of
a
tad
bit
lighter
than
becks
with
a
little
more
stellalike
carbonation
the
smell
was
surprisingly
good
and
unskunked
i
give
it
to
the
european
light
beer
makers
they
keep
the
light
versions
of
their
beers
unskunked
somehow
the
taste
along
with
heineken
light
one
of
the
best
light
beers
ive
ever
encountered
im
amazed
that
its
65
calories
too
thats
about
four
of
these
for
one
16
oz
bottle
of
cocacola
calorie
wise
and
thats
damn
impressive
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
as
expected
but
hey
what
do
you
want
when
youre
buying
this
beer
reminds
like
a
lot
like
a
stella
for
how
this
beer
drinks
goes
well
with
uncomplicated
snacking
food
doesnt
have
that
machined
taste
like
regular
becks
has
ill
say
it
again
props
on
the
calories
makes
michelob
ultra
its
bitch
while
its
the
dominatrix
this
has
to
the
my
hardest
beer
review
because
honestly
there
was
no
taste
to
this
beer
its
very
drinkable
but
then
again
so
is
water
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
the
smell
is
boring
and
barely
there
the
appearance
is
pale
yellowgolden
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
most
boring
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
water
somewhat
saves
it
but
this
is
perhaps
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
i
understand
it
is
light
but
this
is
just
not
good
at
all
bottom
line
if
it
comes
down
to
this
or
water
save
the
3
and
get
the
water
pale
straw
with
a
mediumsized
foamy
white
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
thin
partial
film
ah
the
skunk
of
a
eurocheapo
not
too
strong
but
the
other
characteristics
are
so
mild
that
its
hard
to
pick
up
much
else
except
some
weak
grain
the
taste
is
mild
and
boring
but
theres
offensive
in
there
well
not
until
you
get
to
the
husky
finish
it
has
a
thin
body
crisp
dry
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
the
nose
ruins
this
one
for
me
not
that
the
other
characteristics
of
the
beer
are
that
much
better
becks
light
is
lousy
beer
and
is
the
loser
of
macro
smackdown
viii
somehow
i
think
the
german
brewing
industry
will
survive
this
little
setback
it
hardly
makes
sense
to
pick
a
winner
when
both
beers
do
absolutely
nothing
to
distinguish
themselves
but
thats
half
the
fun
of
the
macsmack
series
im
still
looking
for
the
other
half
bottom
line
avoid
becks
light
like
the
plague
the
beer
pours
an
almost
clear
color
with
a
slight
yellow
hue
it
has
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
clean
crisp
pale
malt
scent
with
some
adjuncts
its
light
and
has
that
green
bottle
aroma
the
taste
is
less
than
average
it
has
an
almost
tasteless
flavor
its
like
flavored
water
there
is
little
malt
or
hops
present
very
light
the
mouthfeel
is
average
this
is
typical
for
a
light
lager
theyre
low
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
its
not
an
enjoyable
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
very
light
bodied
beer
with
moderate
carbonation
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
very
drinkable
not
only
the
only
light
beer
i
drink
but
one
of
the
few
imported
beers
too
this
beer
is
an
excellent
example
of
what
a
light
beer
should
taste
like
very
similar
in
taste
to
the
standard
becks
beer
but
just
slightly
understated
in
my
opinion
the
lighter
clean
taste
makes
the
beer
much
more
drinkable
in
a
perfect
world
this
beer
would
replace
amstel
light
as
the
standard
high
end
light
beer
had
this
on
tap
and
it
had
little
to
no
head
when
it
got
to
my
table
it
was
decent
in
appearance
looked
like
a
light
beer
i
could
enjoy
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
the
most
disappointing
for
me
really
watered
down
and
very
little
flavor
personally
the
only
way
i
could
drink
this
beer
is
if
im
having
a
lot
of
them
and
wont
be
concentrating
on
the
details
pours
a
very
light
color
it
has
a
nice
snowwhite
colored
head
but
the
beer
seems
to
look
even
more
watereddown
than
an
average
american
beer
it
has
that
skunky
scent
to
it
really
does
smell
like
a
german
pilsener
however
the
taste
is
not
skunky
or
bitter
at
all
like
i
had
expected
it
does
taste
very
watered
down
but
im
trying
this
beer
immediatly
after
a
normal
becks
which
might
impair
my
judgment
a
little
i
suppose
not
having
that
intense
skunk
flavor
is
a
good
thing
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
hardly
tastes
like
much
at
all
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
too
watery
for
my
liking
i
suppose
its
better
than
miller
light
or
old
milwaukee
but
not
quite
worth
the
extra
penny
green
well
known
bottle
with
suprise
best
before
dating
pours
pissy
yellow
clear
medium
bubble
white
head
nose
is
blandly
vegetal
as
expected
there
is
not
much
to
like
with
this
one
light
bodied
minimal
pleasing
malt
character
limited
bitterness
what
flavor
is
picked
up
is
skunky
cardboardy
low
carb
low
cal
low
enjoymentpass
this
lame
stuff
by
i
will
next
time
this
review
is
based
on
several
bottled
samples
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
it
was
on
special
13
for
a
24pack
case
i
dont
usually
go
for
light
beers
and
wouldnt
have
gotten
it
at
its
usual
22
retail
priceregular
and
dark
becks
are
both
better
and
are
the
same
retail
pricebut
at
the
sale
price
it
was
competing
with
the
likes
of
busch
and
keystone
and
at
this
level
it
competes
well
and
you
need
make
no
apologies
for
making
the
purchase
tastes
similar
to
regular
becks
but
lighter
thinner
and
grainier
it
even
has
some
of
that
familiar
astringent
kick
towards
the
end
but
of
course
a
much
weaker
version
its
drinkable
and
has
a
clean
finish
really
clear
and
light
colored
as
with
any
green
or
clear
bottled
beer
dont
get
the
open
sixpacks
stick
with
the
12
packs
and
cases
hence
avoiding
the
frequently
mentioned
skunkiness
and
are
in
any
event
a
better
buy
overallanother
dissapointment
from
becks
not
that
i
was
expecting
much
knowing
their
lineup
and
that
this
is
a
light
beer
but
still
this
is
amazingly
clean
and
thin
almost
as
much
to
the
point
of
natty
light
not
all
that
much
flavor
amazingly
overpriced
as
well
oddly
this
was
less
skunky
than
regular
becks
who
knew
amstel
light
is
a
much
more
flavorful
light
lager
for
the
price
if
you
dont
want
to
pay
much
stick
with
american
light
beers
if
its
your
style
over
this
overpriced
import
its
drinkable
but
little
more
than
that
i
just
had
three
with
a
meal
after
having
a
couple
when
i
got
it
home
and
i
think
im
going
to
save
the
rest
to
offer
guests
its
not
a
terrible
buy
paid
9
98
for
a
12
but
not
something
im
going
to
get
very
often
for
my
own
personal
drinking
pours
a
barelythere
straw
color
that
is
just
a
shade
more
yellow
than
water
no
head
just
tiny
islands
of
white
bubbles
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
smells
like
most
other
euro
lagers
of
grassy
malt
slight
doughiness
also
detected
taste
is
of
light
grassy
malt
and
soda
waterlike
carbonation
a
big
glass
of
nothing
not
much
flavor
not
worth
the
price
or
the
calories
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
fluffy
2
white
head
above
the
clear
light
pssyellow
brew
head
fades
as
fast
as
it
can
but
does
settle
down
to
about
14
of
bubbles
and
lacing
is
okay
aroma
is
that
usual
seems
skunky
scent
that
becks
and
heineken
seem
to
have
although
perhaps
even
more
so
taste
is
almost
nonexistant
seeming
more
like
slightly
smoothed
water
with
a
small
bitter
kick
at
the
end
i
know
its
a
light
beer
but
come
on
mouthfeel
is
okay
if
this
is
what
youre
looking
for
but
i
expected
beer
characteristics
drinkability
is
high
but
then
again
so
is
waters
this
is
me
keeping
away
from
light
beers
i
read
other
light
beer
reviews
and
most
of
the
negative
reviews
are
from
people
who
clearly
dont
like
light
beer
not
horrable
overall
had
this
ahile
ago
someone
bought
it
instead
of
regular
not
a
total
loss
but
is
itll
perfer
regular
beck
descent
taste
not
as
watered
down
as
some
other
light
beers
yet
not
as
flavorful
as
some
others
ie
sam
light
i
reccomend
it
for
a
drinker
acostoming
himself
to
german
brews
im
not
really
overly
impressed
about
this
beer
in
any
way
but
as
a
becks
fan
from
way
back
i
was
weaned
on
the
stuff
by
my
older
bro
i
will
say
this
does
taste
the
way
a
becks
light
should
taste
if
i
had
to
imagine
it
the
color
is
that
of
a
cheap
pinot
grigio
though
there
is
a
decent
head
on
this
thing
and
a
modest
stick
as
well
as
lace
aroma
is
all
becks
skunk
need
i
say
more
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
step
above
water
with
a
mildly
crisp
snap
of
refreshment
flavors
are
typical
becks
skunkorama
sweet
malty
grainy
and
a
tad
cloying
but
mildly
quenching
this
stuff
goes
well
with
frozen
pizzai
tried
one
with
a
pie
that
i
stipped
off
all
the
crappy
topping
and
added
my
own
delicious
broccoli
and
returned
the
cheesea
light
delight
though
sick
to
say
this
stuff
is
mildly
drinkable
in
my
book
just
a
dreadful
beer
in
any
number
of
ways
best
avoided
purchased
a
single
for
1
40
it
is
an
okay
specimen
of
a
light
lager
not
recommended
a
touch
better
than
bmc
light
not
as
good
as
sammy
though
whatever
they
are
charging
for
this
stuff
it
is
not
worth
the
import
price
at
the
very
most
this
beer
is
boring
cheap
tasting
and
skunky
i
will
stay
away
from
this
one
green
skunky
damn
this
could
be
a
half
decent
light
beer
were
it
not
produced
in
green
when
will
they
learn
straw
colored
with
a
nice
foamy
white
rapidly
dissipating
head
a
thin
spider
web
lace
trails
along
the
skunklike
aroma
hides
a
fragrant
malt
and
floral
hop
the
thin
herbal
malt
is
completely
dominated
by
sharp
metallic
and
underlying
citrus
bitterness
still
one
of
the
better
light
beers
around
might
even
give
sam
adams
light
a
run
for
their
money
in
dark
brown
bottles
drinkabilitynotes
the
worst
german
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
and
when
are
brewers
going
to
throw
in
the
towel
on
clear
glass
bottles
samuel
smiths
seems
to
have
finally
abandoned
clear
glass
when
will
the
rest
i
bought
this
out
of
curiosity
being
something
of
a
german
beer
lover
it
pours
like
regular
becks
looks
like
regular
becks
but
it
isnt
becks
the
taste
is
very
watered
down
disappointingly
so
i
cant
really
tell
much
more
other
than
i
hated
it
i
actually
got
sick
to
my
stomach
drinking
this
stuff
sorry
i
wanted
to
like
it
as
a
rule
i
would
not
touch
a
beer
labeled
light
but
becks
makes
some
drinkable
beers
on
the
pour
a
light
clear
gold
the
head
a
bright
white
the
lace
decent
nose
is
malt
a
tad
sweet
clean
and
crisp
front
is
malt
the
top
thin
the
finish
is
dry
highly
acidic
lightly
hopped
and
as
i
expected
something
that
does
not
appeal
to
me
not
that
it
is
bad
just
not
my
style
of
beer
but
would
appeal
to
the
occasional
beer
or
light
beer
drinker
packaged
in
a
clear
glass
bottle
which
in
my
opinion
does
nothing
for
the
longevity
of
this
beer
not
that
this
should
be
saved
really
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
aroma
consisted
of
hops
slight
fruitiness
alcohol
and
lemon
mouthfeel
was
watery
with
a
crisp
tingling
from
the
carbonation
not
much
as
far
as
taste
goes
the
first
thing
apparent
was
the
alcohol
with
a
hop
finish
beer
had
a
skunkiness
to
it
both
in
smell
and
taste
i
would
not
purchase
this
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
light
beer
best
before
04
01
it
reads
does
that
mean
april
2001
man
no
wonder
it
was
50cents
a
bottle
doesnt
taste
skunked
light
straw
color
mild
graininess
on
the
nose
taste
is
very
light
but
there
is
some
ok
graininess
emerging
body
is
thin
but
not
obscene
compared
to
some
of
the
other
lights
this
is
ok
im
not
a
big
fan
of
becks
and
would
never
buy
this
again
it
is
much
worse
than
s
a
light
but
ok
when
compared
to
coors
light
etc
okay
i
am
still
waiting
for
the
major
brewies
to
get
a
light
beer
right
the
europeans
still
do
a
better
job
than
us
with
things
like
this
and
amstel
but
they
still
dont
touch
what
the
smaller
makers
are
doing
i
dont
get
it
i
still
dont
get
the
light
market
reminiscent
of
amstel
with
a
bit
of
sugar
and
water
no
smell
to
speak
of
notes
why
there
is
no
need
for
this
we
have
our
own
light
beers
to
make
fun
of
this
is
damn
near
close
to
water
tap
water
at
that
if
i
want
light
beer
not
that
i
ever
do
ill
just
stick
to
domestic
light
beer
dont
waste
your
time
on
this
one
has
a
similarity
to
amstel
light
though
the
head
is
better
in
this
beer
horrible
both
times
i
have
tried
this
beer
it
has
been
lightstruck
due
to
the
clear
bottle
why
oh
why
is
this
even
made
this
is
a
bad
beer
pale
pale
greenish
yellow
champagnelike
head
that
lasts
for
20
seconds
and
then
is
completely
gone
skunky
aroma
beckslike
in
first
impression
but
very
fleeting
the
skunkcrisp
combo
makes
is
seem
mildly
german
importlike
but
the
taste
finishes
with
a
distinct
distilled
water
taste
anyone
want
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
um
i
guess
best
light
beer
my
goto
light
beer
actually
the
only
light
beer
i
like
by
far
the
best
light
beer
ive
ever
had
i
knew
i
could
count
on
sam
adams
to
succeed
in
making
a
light
beer
that
has
all
the
full
flavor
of
a
normal
brew
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
but
it
is
definitely
not
my
go
to
beer
if
i
were
to
diet
this
would
be
a
good
choice
great
light
beer
one
of
the
better
from
the
line
this
beer
is
pretty
good
o
really
nice
light
beer
will
go
with
this
over
any
other
light
beer
that
i
have
tried
i
wish
all
light
beers
tasted
this
good
if
forced
to
go
light
this
is
the
choice
i
dont
like
sam
but
this
is
a
light
beer
that
is
close
enough
to
the
nonlight
version
that
it
deserves
credit
in
that
respect
a
good
tasting
light
beer
not
tons
of
flavor
but
very
smooth
drinkable
if
nothing
else
is
around
comparing
this
against
light
beers
like
coors
light
and
bud
light
other
light
beers
this
stuff
is
way
better
decent
flavor
at
a
decent
price
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
this
would
be
my
go
to
lite
beer
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
ive
come
to
expect
nothing
less
from
samuel
adams
weighting

overall

this
beer
can
be
enjoyable
no
matter
where
youre
at
it
has
enough
flavor
to
compete
with
full
flavored
lagers
but
trims
the
fat
in
all
the
right
places
so
many
light
beers
taste
like
corn
or
nothing
this
one
has
malt
character
and
faint
hop
im
not
going
all
the
way
to
say
its
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
just
may
be
the
best
tasting
light
lager
ive
tried
yet
hands
down
new
favorite
lite
beer
the
best
light
beer
on
the
market
o
definitely
tastier
than
the
majority
of
mass
produced
light
lagers
available
in
the
us
especially
those
from
the
larger
brewers
nothing
special
but
easy
to
drink
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
for
on
the
boat
or
at
the
beach
surprisingly
true
to
the
original
taste
for
a
light
beer
crisp
distinctive
flavor
a
step
above
all
other
mass
produced
commercial
light
american
lagers
o
the
best
light
beer
ive
had
to
date
this
certainly
isnt
a
style
that
i
enjoy
often
but
sa
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
overall
it
is
hard
to
beat
sam
adams
light
if
you
are
looking
for
a
quality
light
beer
but
because
of
the
price
and
my
budget
i
relegate
this
to
being
a
rare
treat
when
i
first
drank
this
beer
2003
back
when
i
first
discovered
craft
beer
i
thought
it
to
be
an
excellent
light
beer
but
also
a
good
beer
all
on
its
own
without
the
light
label
i
was
looking
for
a
low
alcohol
session
beer
and
thought
to
give
sa
light
a
try
again
this
time
around
i
was
disappointed
it
looks
great
with
its
amber
color
and
thick
head
to
me
it
leaves
a
hard
water
dry
aftertaste
that
is
all
i
seem
to
get
from
its
flavor
profile
for
what
i
got
and
for
what
i
paid
9
19
a
sixpack
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
beer
again
this
is
the
first
sa
beer
that
i
can
say
i
did
not
care
for
has
good
malty
flavor
very
malt
forward
a
little
watery
but
for
a
light
beer
it
has
a
ton
of
flavor
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
boston
lager
just
a
little
weaker
i
would
recommend
a
beer
like
this
to
anyone
coming
for
a
bmc
background
it
is
very
good
overall
but
for
a
light
beer
it
is
world
class
overall
a
great
choice
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
alternative
pours
a
light
amber
in
color
with
almost
a
1finger
head
with
a
white
head
at
first
which
settles
down
to
a
thin
head
much
darker
in
color
than
other
light
beers
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
which
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
pale
malts
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
was
the
same
but
didnt
have
a
bitter
or
unpleasant
aftertaste
carbonation
was
slightly
above
average
as
is
most
light
beers
but
not
bad
at
all
its
not
bad
at
all
i
cant
say
that
i
like
its
aftertaste
very
much
at
all
but
overall
the
beer
really
is
ok
especially
for
anyone
who
wants
to
indulge
the
fantasy
of
a
diet
beer
o
this
beer
is
pretty
good
compared
to
the
other
light
lagers
that
i
tried
as
it
seems
a
little
maltier
and
less
watery
sam
adams
light
45
this
beer
is
a
real
heart
breaker
i
thought
it
would
be
more
flavorful
but
it
really
isnt
much
better
than
any
other
light
beer
it
looked
like
a
decent
beer
when
poured
not
much
on
the
nose
and
the
taste
was
pure
watered
down
light
beer
i
didnt
buy
it
again
simply
because
the
beer
store
has
other
light
beers
that
are
cheaper
and
basically
taste
the
same
nice
try
though
sa
but
to
sell
it
the
price
needs
to
be
closer
to
that
of
an
aall
this
is
a
good
beer
a
very
good
light
beer
still
it
leaves
something
to
be
desired
on
the
malt
end
of
the
flavor
spectrum
hey
the
calories
had
to
come
from
somewhere
the
hops
are
very
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
i
would
recommend
that
if
youre
interested
you
try
this
beer
because
i
think
youll
like
it
while
i
would
normally
stay
away
from
lighter
versions
of
original
lagers
this
manages
to
be
a
bit
thinner
without
being
a
light
beer
in
the
same
context
as
bud
light
miller
lite
etc
its
really
not
all
that
light
and
while
the
abv
is
quite
low
it
does
not
lose
sight
of
the
hop
flavor
one
bit
and
still
manages
to
be
a
nicely
balanced
beer
just
like
the
original
if
youre
looking
for
a
session
beer
or
just
dont
want
a
beer
thats
so
heavy
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
the
taste
is
remarkably
full
for
a
light
lager
with
a
decent
sweetness
and
slightly
dry
finish
as
far
as
lights
go
this
is
quite
nice
overall
i
have
to
confess
that
i
abhor
light
beers
in
general
because
they
have
almost
no
beer
flavor
or
flavor
at
all
im
looking
at
you
mbc
i
personally
believe
that
light
beers
are
beers
for
people
who
care
more
about
their
appearance
than
they
do
their
beer
andor
dont
like
the
flavor
of
beer
and
therefore
drink
the
light
beers
because
they
have
practically
no
flavor
that
being
said
samuel
adams
light
beer
was
pretty
good
it
had
some
beer
flavor
not
as
much
as
i
think
that
it
should
but
some
and
it
sure
as
hell
didnt
look
like
a
glass
of
urine
like
all
of
the
other
major
light
beers
do
as
far
as
light
beers
go
this
kicks
ass
i
give
this
a
3
overall
because
its
a
light
beer
thats
actually
passable
while
its
far
from
my
favorite
beer
im
surprised
that
i
like
it
at
all
being
a
light
beer
so
that
gets
a
few
extra
points
overall
more
flavor
than
most
light
beer
at
least
theres
some
malt
character
but
the
grainy
flavor
and
notes
of
adjuncts
are
offputting
overall
a
tastier
version
of
a
light
beer
with
more
hop
and
malt
characteristic
for
the
light
lager
style
while
nothing
to
pine
over
it
is
rather
refreshing
overall
for
a
light
beer
its
not
bad
at
all
i
was
turned
on
to
it
by
a
friend
who
told
me
that
sa
uses
it
to
train
their
beer
tasters
and
it
is
used
in
to
train
beer
judges
for
competitions
it
is
a
very
neutral
tasting
beer
and
additions
can
be
made
to
it
to
help
judges
or
tasters
identify
off
tastes
or
maltiness
or
hoppiness
plus
for
me
it
was
a
gateway
beer
to
widen
my
wifes
taste
for
beer
she
is
an
ab
budweiser
girl
all
the
way
and
she
really
likes
this
beer
she
started
drinking
grolsch
this
week
the
recovery
is
going
slow
but
soon
she
will
drink
real
beer
so
for
those
of
you
looking
to
introduce
a
hardened
bmc
drinker
into
the
wonderful
world
of
craft
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
to
start
with
and
hey
its
definitely
a
drinkable
session
beer
thats
relatively
low
in
calories
and
cheap
and
if
you
are
down
to
your
last
beer
you
can
grab
one
from
your
girl
and
not
have
to
choke
down
a
bud
lite
or
shudders
natty
light
from
a
can
no
flavor
notes
sorry
overall
not
what
i
expected
at
all
this
isnt
as
good
as
i
remember
from
trying
it
on
draft
which
i
thought
was
a
decent
version
just
lighter
than
regular
sam
this
is
more
macro
lager
and
bleh
like
not
as
light
as
most
macros
and
much
more
flavor
but
some
unhappy
flavors
amber
color
with
a
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
smells
and
tastes
like
toasted
and
biscuit
malt
with
light
hop
bitterness
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
not
bad
for
a
light
lager
half
finger
head
on
a
clear
golden
amber
body
with
minimal
lacing
sweet
corn
caramel
toasted
malts
flavors
are
clean
and
crisp
with
caramel
malts
but
there
is
a
earthy
and
toasted
flavor
that
tastes
more
like
a
bad
macro
brewed
beer
light
to
medium
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
actually
this
is
a
pretty
bad
light
beer
i
would
rather
have
a
coors
light
than
this
one
the
flavor
is
sour
and
not
very
palatable
wouldnt
have
this
again
the
beer
pours
a
very
clear
and
clean
amber
with
a
slight
rose
tint
the
body
is
superbly
clean
and
translucent
as
it
should
be
for
the
style
with
lots
of
nice
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
light
scrim
head
of
eggshell
white
bubbles
that
sit
at
the
top
of
the
beer
lacing
is
slick
and
thin
running
right
back
to
the
beer
and
not
waiting
around
for
awhile
on
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
light
grassy
touch
stepping
through
from
the
noble
hops
cereal
grain
scents
can
be
detected
in
the
sweet
caramel
but
the
smell
is
very
clean
and
light
as
a
light
lager
should
be
its
actually
quite
nice
to
smell
in
comparison
with
other
light
beers
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
clean
and
light
the
beer
begins
with
the
sweet
caramel
malts
from
the
smell
and
a
waterneutral
taste
that
sits
separate
from
the
malt
but
slowly
the
taste
opens
into
to
grainy
cereal
and
biscuit
notes
with
light
grassy
side
notes
the
finish
has
this
weird
minty
medicinal
flavor
in
it
that
seems
to
have
been
there
throughout
the
sip
but
is
more
prevalent
in
the
aftertaste
although
there
are
also
light
grain
notes
on
the
mouth
this
beer
is
properly
thin
and
watery
with
a
nice
little
trundle
of
carbonation
greeting
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
supremely
clean
with
only
a
slight
hint
of
saliva
to
ask
for
more
beer
the
beer
is
actually
quite
quenching
of
thirst
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
in
fact
it
may
be
the
best
beer
in
its
style
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
has
some
noticeable
and
interesting
flavors
with
minimal
complexity
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
easily
my
only
complaint
is
the
weird
mintymedicinal
taste
that
seems
to
be
hiding
behind
everything
else
overall
this
beer
is
a
success
for
what
the
boston
beer
company
was
trying
to
do
with
it
if
you
want
a
light
lager
drink
this
pours
an
orangy
gold
color
that
is
clear
white
head
disappears
completely
almost
immediately
has
a
bit
of
moldy
somewhat
buttery
sweet
smell
beer
does
not
look
very
lively
taste
is
balanced
but
bland
dry
body
with
light
carbonation
bit
of
a
buttery
aftertaste
is
drinkable
and
smooth
but
certainly
not
impressive
may
have
to
try
again
almost
suspicious
that
i
got
a
subpar
batch
bottle
says
its
fresh
but
ive
come
to
expect
more
from
sam
adams
even
for
a
light
beer
that
said
sam
adams
light
is
far
and
away
the
best
light
beer
on
the
mass
market
its
got
a
watery
mouthfeel
but
it
has
more
flavor
than
nearly
every
american
adjunct
fullbodied
beer
my
father
in
law
drinks
budweiser
and
i
had
him
try
a
sip
of
sam
adams
light
he
said
it
was
too
strong
for
him
thats
how
flavorful
this
beer
is
its
probably
the
best
light
beer
you
can
buy
but
its
essentially
just
good
beer
with
extra
water
added
its
sold
at
the
same
price
as
the
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
great
light
beer
if
i
have
to
drink
light
this
would
be
my
first
choice
onot
sure
why
someone
would
ever
drink
this
beer
light
on
calories
light
on
flavor
however
i
always
wanted
to
try
it
and
now
i
have
better
than
most
light
lagers
but
thats
not
saying
much
overall
this
is
a
good
light
beer
it
has
some
flavor
a
nice
appearance
and
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
it
was
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
would
i
ever
choose
this
again
no
but
is
it
a
drinkable
light
beer
sure
overall
probably
the
first
light
beer
ive
ever
had
that
didnt
tastelook
light
really
good
stuff
that
i
will
buy
again
for
sure
overall
a
good
take
on
a
style
that
doesnt
inspire
much
hope
its
bad
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
light
beer
it
has
more
taste
than
most
light
beers

0
abv
id
have
it
again
when
after
a
light
beer
one
down
side
is
its
price
compared
to
other
lights
if
i
saw
this
sitting
around
like
i
did
today
id
drink
it
i
really
enjoy
it
especially
considering
i
dont
normally
like
light
beers
but
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
justify
paying
upwards
of
10
for
a
6pack
of
this
beer
still
pretty
good
for
a
light
beer
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
but
honestly
it
isnt
very
light
as
far
as
calories
are
concerned
this
beer
kind
of
falls
into
a
hole
for
me
because
i
could
pick
up
yuengling
light
that
has
decent
flavor
and
less
calories
if
i
really
wanted
to
drink
light
beer
if
i
wanted
sam
adams
i
would
just
as
soon
have
a
boston
lager
the
beer
pours
into
the
shaker
pint
a
dark
amber
color
trending
toward
yellowish
a
healthy
cap
of
foam
sits
above
the
aroma
is
of
starchy
grain
and
grassy
hops
the
noble
hops
are
showcased
well
here
the
beer
nimbly
dances
across
the
palate
through
its
carbonation
and
light
body
the
malt
flavor
nicely
emerges
as
the
temperature
increases
not
a
very
assertive
beer
but
a
well
made
light
beer
overall
i
cannot
see
buying
sam
adams
light
when
yuengling
costs
half
as
much
pours
amber
with
a
cap
of
white
foam
brilliant
clarity
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
hints
of
tea
very
very
similar
to
standard
boston
lager
flavors
of
grain
and
light
malts
with
a
bit
of
corny
character
but
pleasant
thin
with
hi
carb
and
lightly
dry
finish
nice
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
for
those
watching
their
calories
biscuit
malt
comes
through
in
the
aroma
more
than
it
did
for
boston
lager
the
beer
smells
grainy
and
the
hop
aroma
is
not
strong
the
beer
tastes
mildly
sweet
and
watery
its
a
little
fuller
than
most
light
lagers
but
still
watery
the
hop
bitterness
is
minimal
the
body
is
light
to
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
the
finish
is
dry
the
drinkiability
is
high
because
it
is
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
but
as
a
beer
it
is
merely
above
average
thus
the
price
for
this
beer
is
not
justified
if
you
are
looking
to
buy
light
lagers
you
could
easily
spring
for
cheaper
offerings
because
the
quality
of
this
beer
does
not
justify
the
price
tag
o
for
a
light
lager
this
is
pretty
good
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
for
the
style
it
does
it
right
this
is
more
flavorful
than
most
light
beers
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
really
something
i
would
buy
again
cheers
o
it
is
a
nice
offering
interesting
to
see
a
light
beer
from
a
craft
brewer
light
beer
is
tough
to
do
and
they
did
a
good
job
i
could
knock
several
out
however
craft
beer
prices
for
such
a
small
beer
is
tough
to
justify
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
for
a
light
beer
now
this
is
unusual
for
me
the
first
light
beer
i
have
ever
really
truly
liked
pours
out
a
standard
transparent
amber
in
color
with
a
sticky
two
fingered
head
with
a
mild
level
of
lacing
left
behind
smells
of
toasted
malts
and
raw
cereal
grains
tastes
of
light
toasted
malts
as
well
combined
with
actual
grainy
flavor
in
a
light
beer
makes
me
one
happy
camper
texture
is
light
but
flows
well
in
the
mouth
without
being
too
watery
finishes
crisply
much
better
than
other
light
beers
i
have
tried
eh
for
what
it
tries
to
be
it
works
its
a
cut
about
normal
light
beers
but
id
still
reach
for
a
berliner
weiss
or
apa
when
i
wanted
something
lower
in
alcohol
i
suppose
this
ought
to
be
rated
fairly
well
for
standing
out
in
this
dismal
category
quite
drinkable
but
i
would
never
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
another
one
unless
it
was
in
a
back
yard
ice
chest
with
a
load
of
corona
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lighter
version
of
the
boston
lager
you
wont
be
disappointed
o
pretty
good
for
a
light
lager
it
has
the
malty
backbone
of
an
actual
lager
but
its
refreshing
and
pretty
light
i
would
def
recommend
rjt
i
like
this
better
than
boston
lager
would
buy
again
no
question
overall
rating
this
solely
as
a
light
beer
this
beer
is
the
best
in
its
class
great
beer
and
a
decent
beer
compared
to
any
other
ale
or
lager
overall
and
keeping
in
mind
that
this
is
a
light
beer
its
surprisingly
good
it
certainly
wouldnt
keep
up
with
say
a
dogfish
head
but
it
wasnt
intended
to
sam
adams
set
out
to
provide
the
world
with
a
flavorful
light
beer
and
they
did
succeed
its
certainly
in
the
top
five
of
the
light
beers
ive
tried
and
is
leagues
beyond
any
anheuserbusch
light
beer
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
beer
is
without
its
flaws
for
it
does
move
too
far
in
the
direction
of
bread
and
grain
flavors
and
could
use
a
bit
more
fruit
and
sugar
which
yes
would
probably
add
calories
to
help
soften
the
flavor
profile
but
for
a
light
beer
its
delicious
exactly
the
sort
of
fare
id
want
with
lunch
after
working
outside
on
a
hot
day
oa
good
light
beer
but
overall
not
one
i
would
normally
drink
ive
always
heard
good
things
about
sam
adams
light
a
lot
of
people
say
that
its
one
of
the
best
options
in
the
realm
of
light
lagers
i
completely
disagree
from
what
other
sam
adams
beers
that
i
have
had
their
octoberfest
and
latitude
48
i
have
been
pretty
impressed
but
i
found
sam
adams
light
quite
disheartening
while
their
was
a
discernibly
more
malty
taste
to
it
as
compared
to
other
light
lagers
it
was
not
a
pleasant
maltiness
the
taste
comes
off
as
a
glass
of
tonic
water
with
a
little
bit
of
quality
beer
poured
in
to
top
it
off
while
you
can
taste
that
sam
adams
used
good
ingredients
in
this
offering
it
just
doesnt
transfer
to
a
good
experience
when
it
comes
to
light
lagers
i
would
much
rather
have
a
generic
bmc
overall
its
tough
to
rate
this
beer
it
isnt
that
great
but
for
the
style
its
downright
superb
i
have
to
give
it
a
middling
rating
but
it
was
actually
better
than
i
expected
and
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
light
beers
ive
had
yet
o
does
the
trick
for
what
its
worth
it
fits
the
style
and
at
a
decent
price
no
other
need
to
drink
another
light
lager
after
this
that
is
if
you
actually
like
the
taste
of
beer
with
better
carbonation
and
a
little
drier
taste
this
would
be
a
good
beer
overall
i
wondered
why
my
dad
raved
about
this
growing
up
and
i
can
see
why
he
mainly
drank
natural
light
at
the
time
and
this
is
a
big
upgrade
and
a
solid
beer
overall
really
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
but
still
nothing
i
would
regularly
buy
for
a
light
beer
this
one
is
pretty
dark
im
not
a
dark
beer
drinker
but
love
sam
adams
beers
so
had
to
give
this
one
a
try
if
im
looking
for
a
light
beer
but
dont
want
to
sacrifice
too
much
taste
i
will
go
for
this
one
smooth
feel
great
taste
has
typical
sam
adas
flavor
overall
it
came
in
a
sampler
pack
2
bottles
of
6
varieties
glad
i
got
this
one
out
of
the
way
it
just
leaves
me
longing
for
the
og
samuel
adams
lager
or
better
yet
samuel
adams
ale
id
have
it
again
o
pretty
good
for
a
light
beer
although
give
me
a
boston
lager
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
pours
light
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
smells
too
grainy
grassy
malty
faint
caramel
pleasant
taste
clean
slightly
drying
finish
surprisingly
hefty
creamy
mouthfeel
for
a
light
beer
and
in
the
end
a
perfectly
respectable
light
beer
if
youre
gonna
go
light
i
guess
you
should
go
for
a
sam
adams
this
beer
delivers
what
it
claims
to
not
a
singing
endorsement
and
for
a
company
that
says
this
is
no
light
beer
and
who
admits
that
calories
arent
light
well
im
not
going
to
rush
out
to
buy
more
this
is
a
nice
looking
light
beer
the
aroma
is
light
but
pleasant
like
honeydew
melons
and
apples
taste
follows
but
doesnt
have
a
lot
to
add
mouthfeel
drops
off
from
the
boston
lager
i
remember
this
as
being
the
most
flavorful
light
beer
i
had
ever
tasted
but
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
light
beer
has
passed
these
lips
i
find
myself
taking
huge
gulps
of
it
just
to
taste
anything
at
all
i
give
it
extra
points
for
being
a
light
beer
which
probably
means
im
giving
it
a
better
review
than
the
full
flavored
sam
adams
but
as
it
has
the
same
calories
as
a
guinness
draft
ill
stick
with
the
guinness
samuel
adams
light
lager
isnt
bad
not
preferred
but
not
bad
the
color
is
a
nice
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
isnt
leaving
alot
of
lace
the
smell
is
caramel
malt
with
sublte
spice
and
grain
undertones
the
taste
is
primarily
malt
with
some
hop
at
the
end
that
helps
the
beer
clear
the
pallet
instead
of
lingering
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
nice
and
smooth
very
drinkable
definitely
can
session
this
one
without
issue
d
pretty
darn
good
for
a
light
beer
far
better
than
most
good
look
fair
nose
a
bit
much
sweetness
and
rather
too
much
carbonation
significantly
better
than
the
average
regular
nonlight
macro
swill
about
the
same
calories
though
with
less
abv
rated
to
light
style
this
is
nice
you
know
if
sam
adams
is
going
to
do
a
light
beer
it
was
going
to
be
good
and
this
didnt
disappoint
i
would
call
it
a
wnbas
sam
adams
boston
lager
dr
you
could
easily
down
it
if
only
you
could
get
past
the
wretched
flavours
a
huge
disappointment
from
sam
adams
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
color
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
small
legs
of
lace
drip
back
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
grains
malt
and
some
honey
notes
taste
is
of
toasted
grains
bready
malt
slight
honey
and
some
mild
citrus
zest
very
little
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
good
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
crisp
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
light
beer
probably
the
best
light
beer
i
have
ever
had
really
overall
impressive
for
a
light
beer
refreshing
very
summer
appropriate
and
a
good
way
to
try
and
get
the
standard
light
beer
drinker
into
craft
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
though
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
only
got
this
due
to
it
being
included
in
the
summer
sampler
12
pack
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
light
lager
that
is
fuller
than
some
regular
lagers
taste
no
thanks
too
sweet
tastes
cheap
odd
off
etc
is
it
light
beer
you
seek
try
a
great
german
or
czech
pils
or
perhaps
an
english
session
beer
although
i
respect
sam
adams
this
beer
is
a
macro
lager
engineered
for
the
masses
i
wont
be
having
this
again
overall
its
a
great
light
lager
its
better
flavorwise
than
any
other
on
the
market
that
said
this
is
quite
good
for
the
style
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
show
a
more
drinkable
light
beer
for
a
lover
of
more
robust
beers
it
looks
a
bit
maltier
in
color
than
most
wimpy
beers
and
it
has
a
more
complex
taste
than
most
i
bought
a
summer
sampler
with
a
5
meat
rebate
so
they
were
cheap
and
my
guests
didnt
drink
much
more
for
me
and
i
am
not
unhappy
that
i
have
to
drink
the
three
lights
they
are
good
do
an
above
average
read
better
tasting
light
beer
but
i
believe
there
to
be
better
examples
of
the
style
although
not
many
very
sessionable
lower
abv
than
most
of
the
big
boys
who
knows
could
be
a
gateway
beer
for
some
graded
to
style
o
definitely
better
than
average
for
the
style
doesnt
have
the
adjunct
character
of
most
of
the
others
refreshing
and
pleasant
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
lighter
straw
color
with
a
good
1
finger
white
head
the
brew
settles
and
looks
very
thin
with
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
malts
most
notable
the
taste
is
full
of
bready
malt
and
some
slight
sweetness
from
caramel
malts
this
is
a
thin
beer
with
high
carbonation
for
the
viscosity
all
in
all
for
a
light
beer
it
stands
up
o
overall
a
pretty
good
light
beers
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
but
better
than
most
light
beers
would
give
it
another
shot
though
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
definitely
opens
alot
with
warmth
its
still
a
mostly
bland
light
beer
when
it
comes
down
to
it
but
easily
better
than
the
majority
of
light
lagers
o
head
of
the
class
for
the
light
lager
category
no
doubt
i
think
id
still
prefer
the
better
adjunct
lagers
schlitz
pbr
than
this
light
however
the
flavor
profile
simply
makes
you
wish
youd
had
a
regular
sam
adams
brew
there
are
times
for
a
lighter
beer
and
pbr
will
still
be
my
goto
for
those
occasions
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
stingy
white
head
that
dissolves
almost
instantly
leaving
a
small
ring
on
top
smells
of
bready
malt
honey
and
toffee
with
hints
of
floral
and
earthy
hops
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
that
grainy
malt
flavor
a
little
bit
of
floral
earthy
hop
flavors
light
bodies
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
watery
mouthfeel
this
is
definitely
not
my
favorite
style
but
if
i
had
to
drink
it
this
would
be
the
one
i
would
choose
theres
enough
flavor
and
maltiness
in
here
to
make
this
an
interesting
lawnmower
beer
and
its
certainly
better
than
the
competitors
in
the
style
o
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
pours
out
a
clear
red
amber
that
with
a
thick
white
head
that
maintains
very
good
lacing
and
retention
the
nose
has
some
sweet
malts
to
it
but
very
little
hops
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
sweet
caramel
taste
followed
by
some
grains
and
a
very
weak
watered
down
floral
and
citrus
hops
to
finish
off
the
taste
a
lot
of
the
taste
reminds
me
of
boston
lager
but
the
flavor
is
so
watered
down
that
it
ruins
the
taste
of
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
watery
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
light
beer
i
ever
tasted
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
likes
a
light
beer
even
though
i
personally
dont
care
much
for
this
style
d
as
far
as
this
style
goes
adjunct
lagers
included
here
its
the
only
one
ive
ever
had
with
any
quality
of
flavor
so
thats
awesome
well
i
am
probably
never
going
to
be
a
fan
of
light
body
and
light
taste
but
this
one
seemed
to
be
done
pretty
well
all
things
saying
i
will
admit
that
the
beer
feels
slightly
bigger
than
the
4
abv
rating
gives
it
so
there
you
have
it
generally
what
im
looking
for
in
a
macrolight
lager
is
a
beer
that
does
not
taste
bad
and
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
this
certainly
does
not
taste
bad
however
it
does
have
a
bit
more
heft
than
some
others
i
guess
that
makes
this
my
goto
beer
when
i
want
something
dumbeddown
but
im
only
having
two
or
three
the
problem
is
that
im
just
not
in
that
situation
very
often
overall
its
not
bad
except
for
that
unfortunate
aftertaste
id
be
willing
to
drink
this
again
if
i
taste
it
again
and
get
a
different
aftertaste
i
will
rereview
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
light
lager
poured
a
clear
amber
color
and
produced
a
nice
white
head
the
head
retention
is
average
and
the
lacing
was
a
bit
below
average
the
aroma
had
soft
hints
of
grain
and
a
slight
amount
of
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
light
in
body
it
had
a
sweet
malt
flavor
and
a
ever
so
slight
hint
of
caramel
and
citrus
in
context
of
other
so
called
light
beers
on
the
market
this
has
to
be
the
best
that
i
have
had
to
date
this
beer
has
flavor
character
and
aroma
like
papa
johns
says
better
ingredients
better
beer
o
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
but
it
isnt
too
interesting
a
better
choice
than
most
light
lagers
but
i
prefer
the
regular
sam
adams
a
lot
more
not
interesting
its
a
light
beer
but
its
sam
adams
so
its
still
somewhat
okay
poured
a
clear
golden
brown
with
a
finger
or
two
of
white
head
that
receded
rather
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
pale
malts
in
the
aroma
with
trace
scents
of
caramel
and
toasty
bread
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
pale
malts
lightly
toasted
very
subdued
hoppiness
though
its
still
present
light
caramel
a
bit
watered
downthis
is
a
light
beerlight
bodied
yet
still
decently
flavorful
for
the
style
drinkable
i
suppose
if
youre
on
a
diet
o
a
pleasant
enough
beer
for
what
it
is
but
it
is
still
just
a
light
beeralbeit
a
light
beer
with
some
flavor
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
you
would
have
a
much
greater
beer
experience
if
you
drank
the
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
which
is
a
world
class
hefe
for
210
calories
in
12
oz
if
you
cant
afford
the
extra
90
calories
you
probably
shouldnt
be
drinking
beer
in
the
first
place
o
if
this
werent
a
light
beer
it
would
be
average
however
keeping
in
mind
that
this
is
a
light
beer
and
not
a
full
flavored
beer
this
is
very
very
good
finally
there
is
a
light
beer
that
tastes
like
beer
and
not
just
some
piss
yellow
watery
crap
that
is
passed
of
as
premium
beer
thank
you
jim
koch
and
the
boston
beer
company
for
making
a
light
beer
that
is
beer
this
is
certainly
not
flavorful
enough
to
be
a
good
beer
and
not
light
enough
to
be
a
good
light
lager
taste
also
begins
sweet
prickly
hops
in
the
middle
on
through
the
close
again
making
me
think
saaz
mouthfeel
is
smooth
although
body
is
light
in
the
middle
with
easy
drinkability
what
do
you
want
its
a
light
beer
and
as
far
as
they
go
not
bad
if
youre
gonna
drink
light
beer
this
is
an
excellent
choice
tastes
light
but
it
also
tastes
like
something
o
im
not
sure
if
ive
had
a
better
light
beer
for
the
style
you
cant
go
wrong
here
one
of
the
best
light
beers
ive
ever
tasted
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tumbler
best
before
september
pours
a
pretty
light
bronze
color
with
two
fingers
of
foam
and
lots
of
carbonation
malt
and
yeast
on
the
nose
with
some
hop
bitterness
smells
pretty
close
to
bud
light
taste
is
reminiscent
as
well
but
with
more
roasted
malt
flavor
not
a
lot
but
enough
to
make
it
much
more
enjoyable
than
bud
light
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
flat
finish
is
brief
and
clean
roasted
malt
lingers
for
just
a
second
with
some
sweetness
and
then
vanishes
nothing
fancy
i
dont
know
if
this
is
what
they
were
going
for
but
they
built
a
nice
session
beer
if
youre
used
to
sessioning
a
12
pack
of
bud
light
or
something
similar
this
beer
looks
and
smells
nice
flavor
is
very
lacking
but
no
bad
tastes
of
note
an
easy
drinker
dry
aftertast
but
horribly
boring
if
i
want
something
this
lacking
in
flavor
a
nd
easy
to
drink
id
save
12
a
6pack
and
buy
a
bmc
of
preference
clear
light
amber
with
a
quickly
dissipating
cap
of
beige
foam
hence
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
was
present
though
a
few
stray
bubbles
did
top
the
beer
for
a
while
sweet
caramel
marshmallow
aroma
with
some
fruity
and
spicy
notes
medium
to
low
bitterness
nicely
balanced
by
more
caramel
same
hop
profile
as
the
aroma
the
malt
did
disappear
towards
the
end
of
each
sip
leaving
some
lingering
spicy
hops
and
metallic
character
behind
medium
to
light
bodied
average
carbonation
slight
dryness
decent
texture
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
quite
a
good
light
lager
it
has
way
more
flavour
than
similar
offerings
from
the
big
brewers
overall
this
is
the
best
light
beer
ive
had
if
you
want
to
drink
a
light
beer
this
is
the
one
to
drink
this
is
a
refreshing
light
beer
although
i
still
holds
true
to
the
watereddown
taste
it
has
more
flavor
then
the
major
light
beer
brands
it
has
a
typical
beer
smell
with
nothing
worth
noting
all
in
all
it
is
an
average
beer
compared
to
full
bodied
beers
but
good
compared
other
light
beers
this
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
i
expected
a
very
bland
beer
and
what
i
got
was
a
halfway
decent
beer
this
is
easily
the
best
light
beer
i
have
tried
while
not
going
to
change
styles
over
this
if
you
want
a
light
beer
that
actually
has
flavor
give
this
one
a
try
o
this
tastes
okay
and
is
beyond
quaffable
this
beer
is
a
great
alternative
to
the
light
adjuncts
out
there
i
wouldnt
buy
this
regularly
but
in
a
spot
this
works
for
me
pretty
good
in
a
pinch
o
a
solid
light
lager
that
does
not
really
drink
like
a
light
lager
has
some
nice
flavor
for
a
light
lager
but
has
a
little
sourness
and
skunkiness
to
it
overall
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
this
was
indeed
a
bold
move
by
boston
beer
company
and
this
is
actually
a
good
beer
want
to
take
some
craft
beer
to
a
cookout
and
not
get
hassled
by
your
bmc
drinking
friends
get
this
they
might
even
enjoy
it
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
if
nothing
else
its
hard
to
get
excited
about
a
light
lager
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
comparatively
pouts
a
transparent
amber
color
with
a
light
one
finger
white
head
the
head
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
little
alcing
in
my
glass
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
and
light
malts
taste
is
grainy
and
bready
with
a
light
herbal
hops
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
light
fluffy
carbonation
overall
this
isnt
a
very
impressive
beer
but
when
you
consider
the
competition
it
looks
a
lot
better
it
certainly
blows
the
socks
off
bud
light
d
this
is
the
most
beer
like
light
beer
that
i
have
ever
encountered
there
is
genuine
malt
character
here
and
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
it
isnt
complex
enough
to
warrant
deep
examination
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
it
does
make
you
wonder
just
how
light
this
beer
actually
is
oi
admit
i
hate
hate
hate
bmc
light
beers
to
the
max
its
not
the
lack
of
taste
to
me
but
they
honestly
make
me
sick
i
can
get
sicker
quicker
off
of
bmc
light
beers
than
craft
beers
even
though
their
abv
is
lower
this
light
lager
lacks
that
gross
quality
other
light
lagers
seem
to
have
it
still
is
not
a
beer
i
will
be
enjoying
on
any
occasion
even
if
im
drinking
for
volume
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
this
does
make
me
miss
the
old
lightship
ale
which
was
way
more
flavorful
o
d
well
for
a
light
lager
this
is
exceptional
reviewing
to
style
this
is
a
great
beer
i
dont
like
it
very
much
but
its
simply
much
better
than
other
similar
beers
that
ive
had
drinkability
was
great
especially
on
a
hot
day
easy
to
tell
this
is
a
lighter
version
of
the
boston
lager
great
beer
for
summer
grilling
light
crisp
but
still
get
a
good
taste
of
the
malts
that
is
synonamous
with
the
boston
lager
oa
step
in
the
wrong
direction
from
boston
lagerto
watered
down
with
not
alot
of
flavor
always
like
boston
lager
its
a
light
beer
thats
just
not
for
me
found
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
one
in
one
of
the
samuel
adams
mixed
12
packs
admittedly
especially
for
a
light
beer
this
one
aint
bad
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
other
than
an
easy
drinkability
but
there
is
some
light
hoppiness
and
a
nice
malt
undertone
overall
pretty
good
especially
for
a
light
lager
but
it
has
its
missteps
still
working
within
the
limitations
of
the
style
sam
adams
has
done
a
pretty
good
job
here
final
notes
for
a
light
beer
this
is
where
its
at
its
a
little
more
caloric
than
the
other
options
when
it
comes
to
light
beer
but
its
a
lot
more
flavorful
however
it
is
still
a
light
beer
and
as
such
dont
set
the
bar
too
high
for
it
decent
though
oa
not
bad
but
not
fantastic
either
theres
nothing
that
stands
out
about
sam
adams
light
but
nothing
puts
it
off
either
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
notched
at
aug
pours
a
translucent
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
aroma
is
biscuits
and
floral
some
grape
aroma
and
a
bit
tart
some
caramel
flavor
along
with
a
biscuity
taste
definitely
tastes
watered
down
slight
tart
aftertaste
of
the
grapes
to
quote
every
athlete
ever
it
is
what
it
is
and
what
this
is
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
but
it
is
probably
the
best
light
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
feel
it
is
a
bit
of
a
ripoff
to
put
it
in
the
summer
mix
pack
but
it
does
fit
in
well
overall
its
not
bad
but
i
hope
i
dont
ever
have
to
drink
it
by
default
o
as
far
as
light
lagers
go
this
is
at
the
head
of
its
class
i
cant
think
of
another
in
its
class
that
matches
its
flavor
if
your
going
to
worry
about
calories
it
might
as
well
taste
good
do
definitely
a
better
alternative
to
bmc
but
i
honestly
wouldnt
notice
much
of
a
difference
at
all
if
i
was
drunk
and
throwing
them
back
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
when
you
are
cooking
on
the
grill
and
while
eating
dinner
like
a
steak
overall
this
is
a
lite
beer
guaranteed
that
if
you
held
a
tastetesting
contest
no
one
would
get
that
it
was
a
lite
beer
sam
adams
sure
has
more
better
choices
well
mostly
than
this
one
but
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
hoping
it
would
be
along
the
lines
of
a
boston
lager
or
something
but
to
my
surprise
there
was
basically
no
hops
i
have
had
it
since
and
still
no
hops
to
me
its
like
they
made
the
stuff
out
of
all
malts
and
not
much
else
so
with
that
i
feel
the
balance
is
is
little
off
i
would
still
choose
this
over
most
light
beers
though
o
definitely
not
what
most
of
us
think
of
when
it
comes
to
a
light
lager
but
this
is
still
a
good
choice
looks
like
a
full
flavor
beer
but
with
a
head
that
pretty
much
goes
away
as
you
get
through
the
beer
you
can
smell
the
spicy
perfume
like
noble
hops
with
a
sweet
malt
small
you
can
definitely
tell
its
a
light
beer
from
the
first
sip
but
by
no
means
a
coors
budweiser
or
miller
the
slight
spicy
hop
is
the
very
first
thing
that
you
taste
then
with
a
bready
sweet
malt
ending
with
a
flash
of
citrus
from
the
hops
you
can
also
taste
the
yeast
mixing
quite
nicely
with
the
malt
and
fruitiness
from
the
hops
extremely
well
crafted
you
can
tell
they
put
a
lot
of
time
into
making
this
a
flavorful
light
beer
and
making
sure
all
the
flavors
meld
together
amazingly
i
always
notice
the
yeast
taste
more
in
light
beers
whats
funny
is
that
this
is
more
flavorful
then
not
the
light
version
of
the
big
3
but
the
full
flavored
versions
of
bud
miller
and
coors
and
this
is
a
light
beer
their
light
beers
compared
to
this
are
pure
water
this
is
kind
of
watered
down
in
the
body
which
makes
it
extremely
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavors
hit
you
and
are
impossible
not
to
notice
definitely
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
but
wow
this
is
delicious
for
a
light
beer
drinkability
if
i
had
to
have
a
light
beer
i
suppose
id
choose
this
glad
they
have
somewhat
stopped
including
this
in
the
variety
packs
and
including
a
new
beer
instead
the
light
beer
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
any
time
quite
tasty
pretty
easydrinking
nothing
really
offensive
but
not
strong
either
i
guess
there
are
worse
alternatives
but
i
cant
say
id
go
for
this
one
and
honestly
if
faced
with
this
vs
other
light
beers
at
a
bar
id
probably
just
save
a
little
money
go
for
the
cheaper
ones
drinkability
is
awesome
great
taste
and
the
refreshing
style
of
a
light
beer
definitely
the
best
i
have
had
and
you
can
read
more
about
my
opinion
above
light
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
some
bitterness
stays
with
you
i
guess
compared
to
other
light
lagers
this
has
a
little
more
flavor
to
it
more
drinkable
than
the
other
options
they
had
drinkability
is
for
the
style
amazing
drinkability
is
quite
high
the
mildness
pleasant
flavor
and
manageable
abvs
make
this
a
great
party
choice
overall
this
is
the
best
light
lager
out
there
but
thats
really
not
saying
much
probably
the
easiest
step
for
someone
to
take
whos
looking
to
go
from
bmc
to
craft
for
those
of
us
who
have
already
gone
off
the
deep
end
this
is
a
reminder
of
simpler
days
pours
a
light
amber
color
has
a
nice
head
to
it
has
a
hoppy
beer
scent
to
it
just
like
sam
adams
lager
does
it
has
a
darker
taste
which
is
odd
for
a
light
beer
almost
that
of
yeungling
it
is
the
best
tasting
light
beer
ive
ever
had
it
goes
down
smooth
as
well
the
color
scent
taste
ratio
blows
other
light
beers
out
of
the
water
i
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
usually
drank
out
of
the
12oz
bottle
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
the
aroma
was
malty
and
floral
the
flavor
was
a
malt
base
with
a
citrus
finish
light
body
and
mild
carbonation
this
is
actually
one
of
the
better
light
beers
ive
had
better
than
sam
adams
lager
imo
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
quite
good
this
beer
goes
down
easily
but
as
a
light
beer
thats
kind
of
what
its
supposed
to
do
just
a
nice
inoffensive
easy
drinking
beer
that
can
really
hit
the
spot
nothing
stellar
but
its
a
nice
brew
that
lives
above
the
light
label
overall
a
very
solid
offering
and
a
light
beer
that
can
be
counted
on
to
do
what
it
does
d
very
drinkable
smooth
and
refreshing
with
good
flavors
verdict
light
beers
never
venturing
far
into
my
drinkers
repertoire
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
light
lagers
one
can
get
for
their
money
it
does
a
good
job
at
being
light
without
sacrificing
quality
or
content
its
not
too
watery
and
has
plenty
of
flavor
much
more
than
say
bud
light
in
the
end
i
wouldnt
go
for
more
knowing
that
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
costs
about
the
same
and
is
far
more
fulfilling
but
if
you
feel
like
a
light
beer
for
whatever
reason
there
is
no
shame
in
picking
one
of
these
up
b
3
45
d
i
liked
this
to
an
extent
and
i
like
that
its
a
four
percenter
my
favorite
kind
d
goes
down
very
easily
somewhat
tasty
not
filling
minor
kick
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
ive
not
had
a
light
lager
before
and
although
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
the
macro
selection
generally
available
out
at
the
bars
better
than
other
light
lagers
such
as
bud
light
but
still
not
too
much
going
on
here
one
of
the
weakest
offerings
from
boston
beer
company
seems
like
a
decent
session
beer
if
you
wanted
something
a
notch
above
bmc
otherwise
i
think
sam
adams
has
plenty
better
options
for
sam
im
not
impressed
light
beer
shouldnt
even
be
a
category
d
im
no
expert
on
the
style
since
most
light
lagers
i
see
are
of
the
bmc
variety
but
this
one
is
actually
drinkable
and
is
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
in
the
right
situation
i
usually
despise
all
light
beers
but
on
a
whim
at
the
local
casino
the
drink
lady
brought
me
one
of
these
by
mistake
i
stared
at
it
for
a
while
before
i
finally
decided
id
actually
try
it
i
am
a
huge
sam
adams
fan
and
this
is
one
of
the
few
sam
beers
i
have
not
tried
it
was
slightly
better
than
an
average
light
beer
with
a
weak
aroma
nonexistent
taste
and
no
trace
of
head
with
way
too
much
carbonation
while
it
could
be
worse
it
could
have
been
better
if
you
like
coors
light
and
youre
tired
of
getting
made
fun
of
for
drinking
it
give
yourself
a
better
name
and
you
really
dont
have
to
sacrifice
the
taste
all
that
much
from
coors
light
at
least
youre
drinking
a
sams
right
d
overall
this
is
enjoyable
for
a
light
beer
but
it
does
not
stand
up
at
all
against
other
samuel
adams
beers
still
if
i
have
to
have
light
beer
arond
id
prefer
this
one
i
was
at
the
airport
and
it
was
the
choice
between
this
and
hieneken
in
a
bottle
i
wasnt
thrilled
about
either
but
since
i
hadnt
tried
this
i
thought
i
would
it
was
pretty
much
exactly
as
advertised
a
light
version
of
sam
adams
it
did
have
the
malty
character
but
in
a
very
watery
way
the
color
was
certainly
darker
than
a
typical
bud
or
becks
but
not
as
dark
as
a
regular
sam
aroma
was
light
but
present
flavor
as
mentioned
had
a
decent
malt
presence
but
a
little
watery
i
had
two
of
them
in
the
early
afternoon
and
was
able
to
easily
navigate
through
the
rest
of
my
day
amber
brew
with
a
nose
of
honey
caramel
and
grassy
hops
light
crisp
body
i
can
not
say
the
brew
does
not
have
flavors
but
they
are
barely
noticeable
some
earthy
hops
and
honey
slightly
dry
short
finish
better
than
most
light
beers
but
still
it
is
just
barely
drinkable
there
arent
to
many
beers
that
i
would
give
a
perfect
score
to
but
this
is
one
of
them
i
wish
this
was
a
standard
for
an
american
lager
i
really
enjoy
the
malt
aroma
from
this
beer
the
color
is
gorgeous
a
hint
of
yellow
with
light
amber
hue
to
it
there
is
a
very
nice
malt
and
hop
balance
here
light
enough
to
make
it
drinkable
and
yet
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
wanting
more
great
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
good
white
head
that
left
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
fell
this
beer
smells
like
a
light
beer
but
one
that
has
been
kicked
up
a
notch
it
doesnt
smell
too
light
and
it
also
has
some
hop
presence
and
some
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
good
i
mean
you
cant
expect
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
from
a
light
beer
but
this
was
definitely
surprising
it
had
a
good
sweetness
to
it
and
also
you
could
actually
taste
some
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
good
because
it
had
a
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
but
it
was
not
watery
like
almost
all
other
light
beers
i
would
say
that
the
drinkability
was
excellent
i
really
could
drink
these
all
night
long
this
is
the
best
light
beer
i
have
tried
and
it
showed
me
that
there
really
is
a
good
light
beer
out
there
i
think
sam
adams
really
achieved
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
beer
which
was
making
a
light
beer
that
didnt
completely
suck
i
was
scared
to
try
this
at
first
but
i
really
think
its
a
quality
beer
good
job
cheers
d
high
caliber
light
beer
lacking
much
of
the
flavor
that
i
need
to
keep
coming
back
to
it
i
think
my
description
sums
it
up
best
sam
adamss
attempt
to
break
into
the
light
beer
market
should
be
recognized
as
a
success
but
as
with
most
light
beers
the
emphasis
is
on
volume
sacrificing
the
much
needed
taste
and
quality
sam
adams
light
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
that
stayed
around
there
is
a
very
mellow
smell
the
taste
is
also
mellow
light
as
the
name
implies
not
too
much
to
say
about
this
one
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
very
mellow
but
deffently
the
best
light
beer
i
ever
had
for
a
light
beer
i
have
to
admit
this
is
one
of
the
best
offerings
available
i
actually
has
taste
that
makes
you
believe
it
cant
be
a
light
after
trying
watered
down
piss
offered
by
just
about
everyone
triple
hops
this
silver
that
low
carb
blah
blah
blah
it
is
nice
to
finally
find
a
light
beer
you
could
enjoy
while
knowing
you
were
at
least
attempting
to
keep
your
diet
in
line
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
visible
carbonation
bubbles
rising
throughout
smells
fairly
light
but
brings
a
decent
amount
of
light
grain
with
hints
of
caramel
some
like
noble
hops
as
well
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
and
brings
a
fairly
crisp
hop
bite
light
body
with
good
carbonation
certainly
one
of
the
better
light
lagers
out
there
if
not
the
best
sammy
adams
never
seems
to
let
me
down
and
this
light
offering
of
theirs
is
no
exception
you
cant
expect
a
bold
mixture
of
flavors
from
a
light
beer
but
you
also
cant
expect
the
exceptional
drinkability
youll
discover
in
the
first
sip
of
this
delightful
brew
this
is
most
definitely
my
goto
beer
for
nights
dedicated
to
quantity
of
alcohol
over
quality
and
the
quality
of
a
decent
beer
is
still
more
than
present
in
this
heavily
drinkable
offering
from
samuel
try
this
if
boldly
flavored
beers
scare
you
away
if
you
naturally
enjoy
light
beers
or
if
you
are
new
to
drinking
beer
okay
in
the
drinkability
category
d
very
drinkable
appearance
has
a
mid
amber
tone
with
a
crisp
thick
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
nil
lace
smell
is
grainy
with
light
citrus
and
hop
taste
has
full
flavor
for
a
light
lager
having
the
same
flavor
as
the
boston
lager
but
just
lighter
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
body
nothing
bad
about
this
light
id
buy
again
this
light
beer
from
sam
adams
definetly
has
a
lighter
taste
than
the
boston
lager
or
boston
ale
but
it
is
still
very
well
made
at
4
alcohol
it
still
is
a
tasty
beer
and
delivers
the
lighter
contents
without
sacrificing
taste
if
you
are
a
bud
light
miller
lite
drinker
give
this
a
try
awesome
session
beer
in
my
opinion
its
a
light
beer
but
it
isnt
watery
and
has
good
flavor
and
thats
about
all
you
can
ask
for
light
clear
coppery
golden
with
a
slight
fizzy
head
that
quickly
burns
off
light
husky
grain
and
faint
noble
hop
notes
in
the
nose
the
fact
that
is
doesnt
have
off
flavors
puts
it
a
cut
above
other
litelight
diet
brews
the
flavor
is
purely
watered
down
boston
lager
thin
bodied
with
seltzery
carbonation
this
is
probably
the
best
diet
beer
i
will
ever
have
whatever
that
is
good
for
this
was
good
for
a
light
beer
a
lot
better
than
your
typical
macros
i
cant
praise
this
beer
enough
or
stress
its
drinkability
especially
for
beginning
drinkers
its
also
a
great
beer
to
have
if
youre
the
driver
for
the
night
because
of
the
somewhat
modest
abv
all
the
characteristics
of
a
great
nonlight
beer
but
you
can
enjoy
one
of
two
more
because
it
wont
impair
you
as
fast
as
most
other
real
beers
will
happy
drinking
d
easy
drinker
lots
of
flavor
for
a
light
beer
miles
ahead
of
the
other
light
beers
ive
had
over
the
years
if
only
these
were
as
cheap
as
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
lights
this
would
be
my
shitface
maker
boston
beer
company
advertises
this
as
a
light
beer
that
doesnt
taste
light
i
agree
that
but
that
doesnt
make
it
more
than
an
average
beer
a
good
session
beer
but
id
rather
run
off
the
extra
calories
and
just
drink
a
boston
lager
drinkability
it
is
not
bad
for
what
it
is
and
would
be
a
nice
beer
for
the
bmc
buddies
or
drinking
while
eating
pizza
and
hey
ive
been
living
in
boston
20
years
id
like
to
cheer
for
the
locals
i
just
cant
cheer
for
sam
adams
light
drinkability
im
pretty
conflicted
on
this
one
on
one
hand
it
went
down
fast
and
was
pleasant
to
drink
on
the
other
hand
the
only
reason
i
can
see
to
drink
light
beers
is
to
save
on
the
calories
and
this
doesnt
do
it
for
the
same
number
of
calories
ill
take
a
more
full
flavored
beer
this
is
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
thats
light
and
refreshing
its
not
loaded
with
flavor
but
its
still
really
satisfying
taste
is
nothing
like
a
light
beer
its
malty
and
rich
but
a
bit
watery
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
sharp
overall
a
great
light
beer
i
am
not
a
fan
of
light
beer
however
if
you
are
going
to
drink
one
sam
adams
light
would
be
the
one
for
me
its
a
great
light
beer
that
being
said
its
still
a
light
beer
it
looks
great
when
poured
but
i
was
dissapointed
with
the
smell
and
taste
id
drink
it
again
if
it
came
in
a
variety
pack
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
but
i
can
see
why
some
enjoy
it
a
very
good
beer
for
its
style
but
not
my
favorite
sa
offering
definitely
a
good
session
beer
that
wont
make
you
feel
too
guilty
i
will
drink
it
if
i
were
wealthy
wow
what
a
head
very
tight
rich
head
of
about
4
inches
when
poured
into
my
chilled
clear
beer
mug
fine
lacing
right
to
the
last
sip
the
color
is
much
darker
than
i
would
have
expected
for
a
light
lager
a
beautiful
16
on
the
srm

nice
sweet
malt
smell
nothing
overpowering
nothing
overpowering
about
the
taste
just
crisp
and
refreshing
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
one
of
my
top
choices
for
a
light
beer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
you
can
find
anywhere
nothing
distinguishable
about
the
taste
but
it
has
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
does
not
taste
watered
at
all
i
love
almost
all
sam
adams
and
this
beer
does
it
for
any
time
of
the
year
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
visible
carbobation
and
about
a
one
finger
frothy
head
which
gives
way
to
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
faint
with
a
toasty
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
is
of
two
row
malt
toastiness
with
hints
of
banana
and
ctirus
and
a
small
hop
bite
to
it
the
motuhfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
slightly
watery
overall
for
a
light
beer
it
has
great
taste
and
flavor
you
can
easily
drink
a
sixer
of
these
and
want
more
for
a
light
i
would
go
here
first
d
crisp
and
refreshing
could
easily
kill
a
sixer
without
feeling
too
bad
about
it
definitely
the
best
light
beer
out
there
but
thats
kinda
a
valley
of
the
blind
scenario
still
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
taste
there
is
taste
here
people
most
malt
and
hop
feel
in
anything
this
side
of
sprechers
diet
beer
i
guess
if
this
is
the
route
you
need
to
go
sa
is
highly
recommended
drinkability
very
good
for
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
this
does
have
elements
of
the
taste
i
associate
with
sam
adams
that
being
said
i
am
likely
to
go
to
other
beer
styles
first
and
would
pass
it
over
if
it
were
not
in
the
variety
pack
the
beer
has
a
nice
amber
orange
color
to
it
also
has
a
nice
white
head
about
1
then
disapears
to
a
really
thin
white
lace
a
nice
malty
smell
it
has
a
very
nice
malty
taste
at
first
then
a
little
hop
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
would
say
it
is
very
drinkable
and
would
take
it
over
most
light
beers
standard
brown
bottle
with
a
brewery
freshness
date
of
august
poured
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
sam
adams
light
appears
a
clear
light
orange
color
with
about
a
finger
of
head
that
is
composed
mostly
of
bubbles
that
rise
to
the
surface
from
the
etching
in
the
bottom
of
the
sensory
glass
the
aroma
has
a
very
light
grainy
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
hops
taste
includes
the
grainy
sweetness
upfront
as
indicated
by
the
aroma
and
through
the
medium
light
body
has
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slightly
noticable
alcohol
character
in
the
back
of
the
throat
for
only
4
there
is
a
lingering
presence
of
light
levels
of
diacetyl
mixed
with
the
grain
left
in
the
mouth
after
each
sip
tasting
quite
buttery
overall
not
bad
i
guess
if
i
was
forced
into
drinking
a
light
lager
this
would
be
the
one
to
have
drinkability
for
a
light
beer
ill
give
it
this
its
very
drinkable
it
quenches
the
thirst
well
and
it
went
very
well
with
chinese
food
im
rather
impressed
for
a
light
beer
i
can
see
why
it
is
the
highest
rated
one
and
i
would
not
hesitate
to
reach
for
it
if
i
had
to
pick
a
light
beer
if
youre
been
searching
for
a
light
beer
that
you
can
actually
taste
then
sam
adams
light
is
the
way
to
go
cheers
initially
i
was
a
little
hesitant
about
trying
this
beer
because
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
light
beer
but
because
this
is
from
the
boston
beer
company
i
decided
to
give
it
a
whirl
boy
i
am
glad
i
did
overall
a
nice
brew
much
better
than
any
other
light
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
i
would
consider
this
the
king
of
light
beers
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
d
the
overall
drinkablity
of
this
beer
is
high
easy
to
drink
and
is
not
heavy
would
i
buy
this
no
a
nice
beer
to
try
but
not
one
i
would
get
i
typically
do
not
get
light
beers
but
this
one
did
have
a
high
flavor
content
for
a
light
beer
if
you
are
in
search
of
a
light
beer
this
is
the
one
not
dissapointed
but
deffinatly
not
the
best
by
sam
adams
d
this
is
a
beer
that
just
makes
me
happy
that
someone
made
it
infinitely
more
drinkable
than
your
typical
lite
in
that
its
interesting
enough
to
want
more
than
one
of
overall
its
not
bad
certainly
not
typical
of
most
light
beers
this
is
probably
the
only
light
beer
i
have
had
that
i
would
have
again
if
offered
d
very
very
good
and
part
of
the
point
i
am
sure
4
5
beer
is
thin
and
a
little
watery
with
a
grainy
aftertaste
its
mildly
sweet
on
the
front
but
overall
its
a
little
muted
i
guess
its
a
pretty
good
light
lager
but
its
not
a
very
palatable
beer
id
rather
be
drinking
almost
any
pilsner
to
this
what
a
shame
d
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
hey
its
a
light
beer
it
is
watery
compared
to
boston
lager
but
a
whole
lot
better
than
any
other
light
beer
ive
had
its
refreshing
and
enjoyable
and
im
sure
well
cross
paths
again
d
if
we
are
to
truly
call
this
a
light
lager
yeah
its
at
the
top
of
the
category
this
isnt
a
beer
i
am
all
that
crazy
about
but
it
this
beer
is
something
like
the
world
thinnest
fat
person
as
a
light
lager
yeah
its
awesome
in
the
broad
scope
of
beer
ill
pass
on
it
i
am
not
a
light
beer
drinker
but
id
tolerate
having
to
stick
to
these
if
it
was
what
was
on
offer
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
kegs
worth
no
problem
lol
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
mass
consumption
i
only
have
two
of
these
so
the
other
one
will
probably
be
saved
to
drink
tomorrow
when
it
is
even
hotter
out
d
great
will
return
to
this
one
i
was
leery
as
it
is
a
light
beer
but
it
had
a
better
mouthfeel
than
most
light
beers
ive
experienced
i
wanted
the
latitude
48
so
i
had
to
get
the
whole
summer
styles
box
oh
well
i
guess
ill
suck
it
up
and
drink
the
extraneous
bottles
tee
hee
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
tending
toward
more
of
an
amber
in
the
bulb
topped
by
about
a
finger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
light
corn
puffed
rice
and
some
very
faint
hop
florals
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
light
toffee
a
mild
bitterness
and
a
vague
extra
bolt
of
sweetness
which
is
rather
shortlived
honestly
not
as
bad
as
i
imagined
the
body
is
light
do
i
even
need
to
say
it
here
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
solidly
decent
light
beer
a
first
for
me
for
sure
drinkability
fairly
good
but
doesnt
impress
me
having
enjoyed
my
fair
share
of
sam
adams
when
the
selection
is
a
little
thin
at
bars
or
restaurants
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
light
is
also
a
pleasant
beer
to
have
around
when
a
light
beer
is
necessary
d
quite
drinkable
easily
best
light
beer
ive
encountered
this
beer
proves
that
light
beer
doesnt
have
to
taste
like
a
light
beer
ive
said
it
before
sam
adams
knows
what
theyre
doing
sure
do
wish
all
light
beers
were
this
good
not
their
best
but
certainly
tasty
for
a
light
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
watery
just
as
it
should
be
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
actually
quite
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
intended
to
be
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
would
certainly
beat
the
best
of
bmc
and
is
worth
your
time
if
it
looks
like
a
long
day
of
drinking
in
the
heat
goes
down
easy
okay
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
of
these
but
its
drinkable
pours
a
dark
amber
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
head
was
about
a
finger
and
faded
almost
immediately
smell
is
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruit
maybe
citrus
taste
is
almost
all
malt
none
of
the
fruit
you
get
from
the
scent
fizzier
than
what
i
normally
like
well
if
its
cold
i
suppose
its
okay
but
there
are
a
lot
of
nicer
beers
out
there
for
a
light
it
was
pretty
good
way
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
more
flavor
than
i
expected
d
very
smooth
and
clearly
the
best
light
lager
out
there
maybe
a
slight
bump
over
a
bmc
brewed
light
but
still
not
much
better
drinkability
it
was
an
ok
beer
it
was
really
good
for
a
light
beer
i
usually
dont
like
light
beers
they
are
too
weak
for
me
a
cold
one
of
these
might
be
nice
though
especially
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
nice
and
smooth
better
then
other
light
beers
i
have
had
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
but
as
part
of
the
summer
12
pack
someone
had
to
drink
it
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
white
head
that
holds
up
decently
smell
is
sweet
grains
better
than
most
all
light
beers
taste
starts
off
sweet
and
malty
and
finishes
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
easily
drinkable
a
solid
brew
recommended
for
those
seeking
a
tasty
light
lager
solid
maltiness
with
minimal
hops
overall
a
very
refreshing
flavorful
and
quaffable
brew
stellar
for
the
style
t
the
taste
follows
the
sweet
malt
presence
in
the
smell
it
is
subdued
a
little
from
what
i
was
expecting
in
the
aroma
and
there
is
a
watered
down
mouthfeel
not
surprising
since
it
is
a
light
beer
some
hops
make
a
slight
appearance
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
better
than
the
rest
of
the
light
beers
on
the
market
it
still
falls
short
though
of
being
a
great
beer
an
ok
selection
i
suppose
if
i
was
to
compare
it
to
traditional
domestic
light
lagers
it
would
potentially
stack
up
well
but
i
feel
that
would
not
be
accurate
somehow
this
is
probably
the
best
light
lager
i
have
ever
had
easy
to
drink
enough
flavor
to
make
it
enjoyable
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
that
it
says
light
on
the
bottle
i
never
would
have
guessed
all
categories
rated
against
the
other
light
lagers
i
have
had
notes
eh
its
a
light
lager
for
the
style
its
better
than
average
though
so
i
have
to
give
bbc
some
credit
i
admit
i
just
finished
washing
my
car
in
really
muggy
weather
and
its
very
refreshing
then
again
so
would
a
glass
of
water
and
that
would
have
zero
calories
winner
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
crappy
light
lagers
out
there
by
comparison
this
one
is
actually
quite
flavorful
with
a
generous
dose
of
hop
bitterness
that
said
the
flavor
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
their
standard
offering
if
i
wasnt
grading
to
style
the
scores
would
be
much
lower
overall
probably
my
favorite
light
lager
definitely
more
malted
and
hopped
than
larger
commercial
light
beers
overall
ive
had
this
brew
before
and
this
time
i
wasnt
impressed
very
bland
before
this
beer
actually
stood
out
and
was
impressive
for
a
light
lager
d
exceptional
for
a
light
lager
has
a
nice
look
some
taste
and
a
great
body
great
beer
for
hot
days
or
dieters
overal
enjoyable
i
find
this
to
be
not
that
drinkable
far
too
heavy
for
a
light
beer
and
far
too
sweet
after
about
23
of
the
glass
ive
had
enough
its
not
that
it
tastes
bad
but
it
doesnt
make
me
come
back
for
more
perhaps
its
just
not
refreshing
enough
and
thats
what
im
looking
for
in
a
light
lager
d
meh
not
the
most
exciting
beer
in
the
world
but
certainly
not
offensive
just
sort
of
bland
and
reminiscent
of
a
macro
lager
poured
a
nice
amber
with
minimal
lace
mild
smell
of
sweet
malts
and
mild
hops
similar
to
the
regular
boston
lager
well
balanced
in
flavor
but
a
watered
down
version
while
yes
this
is
more
flavorful
than
many
other
light
beers
after
having
zero
light
beers
for
a
very
long
time
it
tastes
weak
in
comparision
but
the
sweetcaramel
malts
are
there
the
crisp
apple
lager
taste
some
hops
as
well
if
i
had
to
choose
amongst
light
beers
id
probably
choose
this
one
but
if
i
could
choose
any
beer
id
probably
not
choose
light
its
worth
the
calories
if
i
drank
more
light
beer
i
would
choose
this
one
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
about
a
one
finger
head
that
leaves
a
little
trail
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
lot
of
citrusy
lemon
flavor
in
it
also
pretty
grainy
with
a
hint
of
caramel
cant
smell
any
hops
the
taste
goes
down
smooth
its
lemony
at
first
with
some
malt
in
the
back
round
and
grain
as
its
going
down
light
yet
flavorful
in
all
honesty
i
hate
light
beers
but
this
is
without
question
the
best
light
beer
ive
ever
had
its
a
truely
enjoyable
light
beer
which
is
something
i
cant
say
for
any
other
light
beers
nice
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
d
easy
the
easiest
to
drink
and
best
tasting
light
lager
i
have
ever
had
in
no
way
does
this
match
up
with
sam
adams
other
brews
but
it
is
undoubtedly
the
most
complex
light
beer
ive
ever
tasted
personally
i
wouldnt
go
with
it
on
most
occasions
but
if
you
want
something
with
taste
that
isnt
too
heavy
this
would
be
a
solid
choice
drinkability
as
light
beer
it
is
a
nobrainer
that
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
lighter
abv
so
it
can
be
drank
all
night
in
short
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
light
beer
ever
made
d
i
can
find
nothing
wrong
with
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
it
is
not
something
i
will
be
seeking
out
but
i
would
never
turn
one
down
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
a
lot
of
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
main
lager
of
the
brewery
but
just
made
to
fit
in
the
light
beer
category
judged
against
other
light
beers
it
stands
up
very
well
smell
is
faint
hops
and
light
amber
malts
some
grassy
hop
notes
nothing
special
taste
is
of
course
light
carbonation
takes
over
but
you
get
some
decent
lager
yeast
flavoring
and
light
hops
mouthfeel
is
average
its
slightly
creamy
but
still
too
thin
for
my
tastes
drinkability
is
great
if
i
was
a
macro
drinker
this
would
probably
be
the
perfect
gateway
beer
into
craft
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
nice
appearance
with
a
pale
copper
color
and
generous
white
head
nose
is
a
little
light
on
aroma
but
has
some
toasty
grains
in
there
on
the
palate
it
is
noticeably
watery
but
surprisingly
has
some
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
to
go
with
the
light
toasty
malt
i
see
a
resemblance
to
the
boston
lager
though
im
not
sure
how
much
they
intended
to
be
there
easy
drinking
of
course
drinkablity
for
this
one
is
actually
exceptional
due
to
the
lightness
and
the
fact
that
i
dont
want
to
dump
it
down
the
drain
after
the
first
sip
strickly
comparing
it
to
other
light
beers
this
is
outstanding
not
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
but
no
offensive
flavors
either
well
done
dthis
is
a
very
easy
drinking
full
flavored
light
beer
and
while
theres
not
a
ton
of
things
going
on
theres
a
lot
more
here
than
you
usual
watery
light
beer
drinkability
highly
drinkable
and
tasteful
for
a
light
beer
pretty
average
for
a
beer
in
general
but
great
for
a
light
beer
sam
adams
impresses
me
yet
again
drinkability
as
a
beer
overall
this
one
is
fairly
average
as
a
light
beer
however
this
stands
out
in
almost
every
way
in
comparison
to
others
i
could
also
see
this
going
well
with
most
foods
d
very
sessionable
a
beer
i
would
definitely
have
all
the
time
in
my
fridge
if
i
was
a
light
beer
drinker
since
this
have
more
flavor
than
any
of
the
style
i
have
had
so
far
fantastic
for
the
style
not
exactly
a
fullflavored
beer
by
any
stretch
nevertheless
at
4
its
not
a
bad
lawnmower
beer
or
lunchtime
table
beer
obviously
a
better
light
beer
than
youd
get
from
the
big
boys
drinkability
was
excellent
perfect
for
getting
your
beer
thirst
quenched
after
weeks
of
hop
bombs
and
huge
stouts
had
this
for
lunch
at
a
local
restaurant
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
thick
white
head
on
top
decent
retention
left
some
sticky
lace
scents
of
grains
honey
and
fresh
bread
light
hop
scent
the
body
is
crisp
and
effervescent
almost
a
little
too
much
carbonation
decent
enough
though
great
bready
sweet
flavors
that
finish
with
a
slight
bitter
pop
i
was
impressed
with
this
the
standard
for
light
lagers
i
think
id
have
this
again
for
sure
amber
appearance
with
light
white
foamy
head
lighlty
metallic
and
bit
grainy
but
largely
the
same
to
me
as
sam
heavy
nice
light
body
that
goes
down
very
easy
excellent
mix
of
malt
and
hops
and
a
faint
bit
of
caramel
the
true
definition
of
light
except
i
actually
prefer
this
over
the
heavy
alternative
completely
drinkable
light
and
easy
going
down
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
one
finger
white
head
light
floral
aromas
the
taste
is
very
light
and
bready
with
biscuit
tones
faint
malt
and
caramel
throughout
very
grainy
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
a
bit
watery
but
compared
to
most
light
lagers
decent
flavor
crisp
and
refreshing
just
very
very
light
and
too
boring
for
me
incredibly
smooth
full
of
flavor
mildly
sweet
very
low
bitterness
absolutely
impeccable
this
is
what
a
light
lager
should
be
i
stock
this
one
in
my
fridge
along
with
peanut
butter
and
jelly
overall
i
really
like
this
for
being
a
light
beer
its
very
clean
and
refreshing
without
being
bland
and
tasteless
no
bad
grain
flavors
not
offtasting
phenolic
flavors
just
nice
clean
and
refreshing
it
is
a
decent
light
beer
it
stays
true
to
sam
adams
the
original
there
are
a
lot
of
beers
that
the
light
version
tastes
nothing
like
the
original
this
not
that
beer
it
seems
to
be
just
that
a
watered
down
version
of
the
original
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
the
reddish
amber
is
just
a
little
lighter
as
with
the
flavor
except
the
flavor
of
hops
they
stayed
the
same
except
the
flavor
of
hops
the
stayed
about
the
same
it
is
what
is
supposed
to
be
samuel
adams
light
is
an
exceptional
light
beer
this
brew
hardly
belongs
in
the
light
beer
category
this
is
a
surprisingly
flavorful
and
refreshing
beer
if
you
havent
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
a
bottle
of
it
ive
yet
to
find
it
on
tap
d
not
high
when
compared
to
other
light
beers
but
very
high
for
any
other
beer
this
beer
is
amazing
for
a
light
beer
i
tried
to
score
it
as
compared
to
other
light
beers
and
i
am
definitely
not
a
light
beer
fan
compared
to
my
favorite
ipa
style
well
you
cant
it
isnt
fair
i
will
say
it
has
more
real
beer
flavor
that
regular
bud
coors
etc
it
looks
real
tastes
real
and
smells
real
most
light
beers
are
more
akin
to
club
soda
than
beer
it
will
never
be
on
my
favorite
list
but
when
trying
to
go
light
it
is
a
winner
sam
adams
beers
are
generally
decent
but
i
must
have
either
gotten
a
skunked
one
or
this
beer
just
really
sucks
nose
was
grainy
taste
was
like
wet
burlap
and
the
finish
was
something
i
could
not
get
washed
out
of
my
mouth
quickly
enough
very
disappointing
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
crisp
with
malts
actually
some
flavor
here
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
i
found
myself
saying
this
is
a
light
beer
for
this
beer
style
this
one
is
darn
good
notes
this
is
in
no
way
what
anyone
thinks
is
a
light
beer
sure
at
only
119
calories
that
might
make
it
lighter
at
4
this
beer
was
made
to
session
just
a
good
beer
in
my
book
might
as
well
have
another
while
im
at
it
notes
bjcp
light
american
lager
there
is
a
tie
between
this
and
michelob
amber
ultra
for
my
favorite
light
beer
both
still
have
a
hint
of
flavor
and
far
exceed
any
of
the
other
macro
lights
lites
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
but
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
style
d
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
but
doesnt
hold
its
own
against
the
regulars
offered
by
sam
adams
when
poured
gave
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
frothy
top
that
did
not
cling
to
the
glass
it
smelled
to
me
like
a
sam
adams
beerto
me
they
seem
to
all
smell
fairly
similar
a
very
smooth
drink
from
begining
to
end
i
also
found
barely
any
after
taste
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
recommend
to
any
light
beer
drinker
bottle
to
glass
honey
color
head
faded
pretty
quickly
smell
was
ok
very
light
malt
and
citrus
taste
was
very
lean
not
much
going
on
got
some
malt
after
it
warmed
to
about
6065
f
thought
this
might
be
a
good
beer
to
just
keep
around
when
i
wanted
something
on
the
light
side
but
not
really
feeling
this
one
if
i
were
to
turn
to
drinking
light
beers
which
i
cannot
imagine
this
would
be
a
decent
choice
serving
type
bottle
clear
sparking
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
nicely
carbonated
minimal
malty
aroma
taste
is
light
and
clean
maltier
than
other
light
beers
ive
tried
got
a
little
hint
of
hops
although
certainly
nothing
powerful
almost
no
aftertaste
and
very
easy
drinking
a
nice
option
when
watching
your
calories
d
as
soon
as
i
poured
this
i
was
impressed
with
the
color
incredibly
colorful
for
a
light
beer
if
light
beer
is
your
thing
which
for
me
it
is
not
then
this
would
be
a
caseworthy
choice
again
for
a
light
beer
this
good
i
certainly
recommend
this
brew
to
all
interested
in
finally
trying
a
light
beer
thats
worth
the
time
and
money
i
bet
this
is
a
big
seller
and
im
certainly
not
gonna
knock
sam
adams
just
because
its
readily
available
i
got
this
one
in
a
summer
variety
pack
and
ive
enjoyed
most
of
the
beers
out
of
that
truth
is
however
id
prefer
they
leave
this
one
out
furthermore
its
tough
for
me
to
contemplate
a
time
when
id
pick
sam
adams
light
over
any
beer
maybe
over
the
worst
of
the
worst
read
milwaukees
best
light
or
king
cobra
but
even
then
it
might
still
be
a
decision
flavor
is
very
light
and
delicate
but
tasty
toasty
and
caramel
malts
are
followed
up
by
a
very
mild
floral
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
to
me
this
is
like
a
light
amber
lager
it
is
pretty
good
for
a
lower
calorie
beer
and
would
make
a
fine
choice
for
converting
some
bmc
friends
d
this
is
a
great
light
beer
but
just
an
ok
beer
overall
pours
a
nice
dark
orangish
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
fast
the
smell
is
not
very
strong
some
hops
and
malt
there
sweet
notes
underwhelming
but
pleasant
the
taste
starts
somewhat
sweet
with
a
malty
flavor
finishes
with
smaller
doughy
notes
could
use
a
bigger
hop
kick
the
mouthfeel
is
light
highly
carbonated
crisp
but
missing
some
balance
this
is
an
easy
drinker
not
much
flavor
but
still
enjoyable
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
better
light
beer
option
strange
the
world
of
light
beers
are
largely
a
massive
oxymoronic
reality
i
think
this
and
yuengling
lager
light
are
the
most
interesting
semimacro
lights
out
there
this
is
sweeter
than
the
big
y
d
as
light
beer
goes
this
is
about
as
a
good
as
it
gets
its
flavor
is
leagues
beyond
the
watery
mainstays
of
this
style
if
i
had
to
drink
a
light
beer
this
would
be
my
only
pick
rated
as
much
as
posible
within
its
style
as
a
light
beer
and
being
that
i
think
this
is
superior
to
most
lights
pushes
its
score
up
some
as
oppossed
to
be
rated
as
a
beer
that
isnnt
light
d
very
drinkable
although
i
feel
like
i
would
get
sick
of
the
sour
taste
after
awhile
d
moderate
to
through
the
roof
not
my
style
of
beer
but
a
shining
light
in
the
dark
underbelly
that
is
the
light
lager
kudos
to
jim
for
not
cutting
corners
on
this
brew
d
for
a
light
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
another
as
long
as
it
came
in
a
glass
i
dont
want
the
stigma
of
light
beer
drinker
advertised
by
the
bottle
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
poured
a
translucent
amber
with
a
1
5
inch
offwhite
head
that
quickly
reduced
its
volume
to
half
its
size
before
settling
into
a
quarter
inch
consistent
cap
copious
tiny
bubble
present
in
solution
simple
nose
cereal
grains
some
caramel
notes
and
a
hint
of
skunk
taste
follows
nose
mouthfeel
was
lightbodied
and
effervescent
just
shy
of
being
prickly
easy
drinking
but
nothing
too
special
however
compared
to
other
light
lagers
its
not
bad
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
light
beers
i
have
ever
had
its
essentially
an
excellent
lowercalorie
replica
of
the
original
boston
lager
the
beer
retains
much
of
the
nonlight
versions
characteristics
without
being
diluted
too
much
i
found
the
hoppiness
to
be
less
distinct
perhaps
the
graininess
was
added
to
compensate
if
youre
looking
for
an
excellent
light
beer
i
highly
suggest
getting
this
one
its
not
as
good
as
the
regular
sam
adams
brews
but
i
rate
it
so
highly
because
its
an
excellent
light
lager
o
this
beer
isnt
very
bad
for
a
light
beer
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
ricecorn
beer
never
thought
i
would
say
this
but
its
just
a
good
light
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
i
dont
know
if
i
like
it
enough
to
buy
it
again
except
during
summer
in
the
variety
pack
but
it
is
the
best
of
its
style
ive
had
this
was
so
much
more
than
i
expected
for
a
light
beer
picked
it
up
in
the
sam
adams
summer
mix
pack
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
it
had
a
very
nice
amber
color
to
it
with
some
semistick
lacing
to
it
that
lasts
most
of
the
drink
had
a
white
fizzy
head
the
middle
dissapeares
about
13rd
through
the
drink
and
the
edges
stay
through
the
entire
drink
oh
yeah
and
good
clarity
like
most
sam
adams
products
based
on
the
appearance
alone
you
cant
tell
its
a
light
beer
the
smell
was
ok
smells
much
less
cheap
than
the
average
light
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
grainy
smell
and
a
little
bit
of
yeast
type
aroma
not
strong
though
you
can
taste
the
malt
with
slight
bitter
aftertaste
again
not
too
string
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
i
found
the
carbination
bite
a
bit
strong
for
my
liking
not
quite
as
strong
as
a
tonic
but
it
doesnt
last
long
despite
the
my
carbination
complaint
i
found
it
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
overall
id
have
to
be
honest
that
i
was
impressed
not
sure
what
competition
this
thing
won
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
against
beers
that
arent
aiming
for
light
this
has
alot
of
character
to
it
its
by
far
the
best
light
beer
ive
tried
goes
down
so
easy
sal
does
not
fill
you
up

a

1
inch
head
with
good
retention
and
good

smells
of
sweet

cleanliness
of

rather
nicely
has
a
high
carbonation
level
smooth
and
crisp
mouth
feel
tastes
of
a
sweet

and
strong
lager
overall
one
of
the
better
light
lagers
ive
ever
had
decent
flavor
and
nose
both
with
a
little
more
complexity
than
you
would
expect
from
a
light
does
feel
light
and
diluted
but
then
again
it
is
a
light
beer
so
what
do
you
expect
for
a
light
beer
its
a
real
contender
just
considering
it
as
a
member
of
the
beer
universe
still
pretty
solid
overall
good
quaff
if
you
feel
compelled
to
drink
a
light
beer
this
is
probably
the
way
to
go
i
have
had
a
few
light
beers
and
this
rates
best
among
the
several
that
i
have
had
the
taste
does
not
differ
much
from
the
reular
sam
adams
lager
and
therefore
is
quite
easy
to
switch
from
one
to
the
other
without
even
noticing
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
light
fruits
wheat
malt
hops
are
prevalent
and
well
balanced
initial
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
and
as
the
beer
warms
and
becomes
it
much
more
fruity
and
light
and
crisp
although
this
is
not
technically
a
lighter
version
of
the
boston
lager
it
sure
tastes
like
it
a
little
less
fruity
weaker
palate
but
certainly
the
best
light
beer
ive
ever
had
and
it
is
so
close
to
the
sabl
that
theyre
practically
interchangeable
i
applaud
sa
for
making
a
light
beer
that
actually
has
flavor
and
no
adjuncts
tasty
and
refreshing

very
good
for
a
light
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
light
beers
out
there
very
close
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
a
littel
less
alcohol
content
though
which
was
the
only
downside
that
i
see
in
this
one
i
think
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again

a
light
beer
with
the
color
of
most
other
lager
style
beers
medium
amber
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
light
caramel
malts
wheat
and
grains
for
a
light
beer
with
a
abv
of
barely
4
the
flavor
is
huge
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
crisp
bite
you
could
put
this
head
to
head
with
many
non
loght
beers
and
it
would
blow
them
out
of
the
water
it
is
the
best
light
beer
i
have
ever
had
taste
is
a
lighter
body
version
of
the
boston
lager
you
can
taste
the
malt
with
some
yeast
i
was
surprised
that
this
beer
was
pretty
good
it
is
one
of
the
few
fuller
body
light
beer
that
i
have
tried
and
enjoyed
light
beer
is
kinda
like
diet
soda
overall
it
sucks
but
if
its
the
only
thing
thats
offered
you
take
it
and
smile
sam
adams
is
definitely
the
best
light
beer
ive
tried
the
diet
taste
is
minimal
if
you
must
do
ligth
beer
this
is
the
one
to
choose
best
american
light
beer
dark
golden
in
color
and
sparklingly
clear
this
beers
carbonation
is
lively
on
the
tongue
and
fizzy
and
crisp
in
the
finish
the
flavor
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
beer
has
a
nice
wellbalanced
hope
and
malt
flavor
most
importantly
its
not
rice
beer
like
most
other
american
lights
and
american
standards
i
like
it
and
will
order
it
again
if
i
ever
go
on
a
low
cal
diet
i
dont
really
know
how
to
go
about
rating
this
beer
compared
to
other
pale
fizzy
watery
lagers
its
spectacular
but
in
the
full
spectrum
of
beer
its
below
average
like
most
light
beers
the
taste
pleasantly
surprised
me
with
a
full
mouthfeel
that
lacked
the
super
watery
fizzy
feeling
that
most
american
light
beers
have
the
malty
nose
wasnt
bad
either
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
had
a
much
better
more
refined
taste
than
pretty
much
every
other
pale
light
lager
ive
ever
tasted
its
a
bit
sweet
malty
carbonated
better
than
the
competition
in
its
bracket
but
obviously
falls
short
when
compared
to
other
higher
quality
nonlight
beers
this
is
better
than
a
bud
light
milller
lite
and
a
coors
light
pours
clear
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
faint
sweet
nose
of
barley
and
goldings
it
does
have
more
caramel
and
hops
in
the
taste
which
sets
it
above
its
peers
not
worth
the
price
but
ill
drink
it
if
someone
else
put
it
in
the
cooler
compaired
to
other
light
beers
this
one
surpasses
them
all
in
every
catagory
got
this
sort
of
to
complete
my
sam
adams
brewing
tries
although
ive
still
yet
to
sample
the
triple
bock
which
i
hear
is
awful
or
utopia
this
is
not
one
of
their
best
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
dissolves
fast
and
leaves
no
lacing
a
touch
of
film
on
top
nose
is
grainy
malt
with
an
almost
macro
lager
aroma
flavor
is
very
mild
a
touch
of
quiet
malt
maybe
a
real
subtle
hop
hint
not
a
lot
going
on
here
especially
from
a
usually
solid
brewer
carbonation
is
busy
on
a
slightly
thin
body
overall
im
not
impressed
ill
give
it
a
bit
of
a
break
cause
its
a
light
lager
and
its
honestly
probably
one
of
the
best
ive
had
that
being
said
its
the
worst
sa
beer
ive
tried
and
yes
truly
worse
than
the
cranberry
lambic
d
i
guess
if
i
am
ever
in
the
mood
for
a
light
beer
or
ever
at
wow
again
and
this
is
the
best
thing
that
they
have
really
it
is
then
the
sam
adams
light
would
add
some
taste
to
a
bland
style
pours
out
a
nice
orangy
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
offwhite
head
aroma
is
rather
weak
lagercrisp
and
not
particularly
inspiring
flavor
is
typical
of
a
lager
fairly
malty
and
a
bit
watery
with
a
wan
hoppy
undertone
texture
is
smooth
and
a
little
tingly
definitely
not
sam
adams
best
but
better
than
other
light
beers
i
have
tried
that
is
all
light
brown
in
color
not
much
head
which
diminished
quickly
not
much
aroma
but
hoppy
floral
scent
very
slight
bitter
tastes
like
a
light
domestic
beer
but
better
somehow
light
body
slightly
oily
again
good
for
a
light
beer
but
if
you
can
handle
regular
beer
go
with
that
instead
for
better
taste
the
choice
is
up
to
you
d
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
of
its
style
however
its
still
not
going
to
be
something
i
purchase
very
often
now
compared
to
all
the
other
macro
brew
lite
beers
out
there
this
one
wins
hands
down
but
it
does
have
more
calories
than
most
light
beers
is
it
really
a
light
then
no
matter
this
is
better
than
any
macro
and
i
would
choose
it
anytime
over
the
best
they
had
to
offer
rumors
had
it
this
is
one
of
the
best
light
beers
available
i
had
to
see
for
myself
out
of
the
bottle
it
poured
a
classic
clear
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
the
retention
was
decent
and
the
lacing
moderate
the
aroma
was
a
little
macro
for
my
preference
but
still
a
good
mix
of
clean
lager
malt
and
hoppy
bitterness
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
too
just
enough
of
everything
with
hints
of
sweetness
and
a
crisp
finish
the
aftertaste
however
was
a
little
metallic
but
for
a
light
beer
the
flavors
are
surprisingly
full
and
malty
the
carbonation
was
a
little
high
obviously
being
used
to
fill
in
the
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
was
still
relatively
smooth
the
body
was
light
and
a
bit
watery
but
again
thats
the
style
so
i
have
to
forgive
it
generally
this
is
a
good
beer
which
is
impressive
for
a
light
so
i
have
to
give
it
high
marks
if
you
gotta
go
light
go
this
way
i
picked
up
this
brew
for
2
reasons
the
first
being
the
usual
reason
you
might
consider
a
light
beer
the
second
being
that
it
was
recommended
by
someone
whose
beer
opinion
i
respect
what
a
great
all
around
beer
light
or
not
the
flavor
and
drinkability
of
the
sam
light
make
this
a
great
session
beer
back
in
2002
i
see
that
todd
says
this
is
a
beer
he
wouldnt
normally
buy
but
im
pretty
impressed
with
it
all
around
and
may
have
just
found
a
new
regular
for
the
fridge
drinkability
very
easy
my
go
to
football
beer
when
its
really
hot
or
if
im
eating
alot
of
food
probably
dont
need
another
review
of
this
beer
so
im
just
going
to
say
that
its
my
default
light
beer
and
what
i
order
when
im
not
in
the
mood
to
be
creative
there
are
certainly
lighter
beers
out
there
but
this
is
just
an
easy
light
lager
for
a
true
light
beer
you
cant
do
a
lot
better
than
this
for
stuff
thats
widely
available
in
the
macro
micro
space
one
of
my
favorite
sa
offerings
i
love
this
beer
i
love
it
for
what
it
is
which
is
a
moderately
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
with
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
its
not
even
fair
to
compare
it
to
other
light
beers
thats
like
comparing
the
lexus
hybrid
to
a
prius
this
beer
is
an
enjoyable
and
interesting
experience
i
always
like
it
out
of
my
frosty
fluted
pilsner
give
it
a
try
ive
had
it
a
million
times
its
nothing
special
but
for
a
light
beer
this
is
not
a
light
beer
confused
its
still
got
a
dark
amber
coloring
full
tasting
in
the
mouth
for
a
light
beer
a
good
malty
flavor
with
a
faint
carmel
highlights
that
i
used
to
love
in
the
octoberfest
worthy
of
drinking
everynight
your
out
on
the
town
or
a
cookout
when
your
not
doing
keg
stands
or
crushing
coors
light
i
dont
know
what
the
reason
is
that
no
one
has
tried
to
make
light
beers
similar
since
this
came
out
but
cheers
to
boston
beer
co
for
pulling
it
off
seriously
compared
to
light
beers
whats
the
problem
had
this
one
the
same
evening
as
regular
sam
adams
not
much
difference
honestly
the
appearance
was
fine
an
amber
color
with
decent
head
but
no
aroma
to
speak
of
even
less
than
the
boston
lager
if
thats
possible
tasted
of
metallic
bitter
malt
but
the
metallic
bitter
part
was
the
most
prominent
component
of
the
flavor
not
a
very
pleasant
flavor
and
it
got
more
and
more
boring
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
bottle
not
impressive
at
all
d
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
this
one
is
like
a
watered
down
boston
lager
i
prefer
the
regular
it
looks
and
tastes
like
some
kind
of
bocklager
hybrid
but
its
actually
just
another
light
beer
taste
mouthfeel
soft
malty
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
toast
and
leafy
hops
becomes
dry
and
crisp
rather
quickly
with
a
light
but
not
watery
texture
theres
a
touch
of
noble
hops
in
the
dry
finish
but
its
not
particularly
bitter
on
the
whole
pretty
damn
good
for
a
light
lager
cant
say
id
buy
this
with
any
regularity
but
its
great
for
what
it
is
for
a
light
lager
i
guess
this
is
decent
but
as
a
beer
i
wasnt
impressed
at
all
on
the
commercials
it
claims
this
beer
won
awards
at
beer
shows
even
though
there
wasnt
a
light
beer
category
i
wonder
what
categories
it
won
in
anywho
its
way
too
light
bodied
and
the
taste
is
severely
lacking
its
drinkable
yeah
but
it
needs
some
taste
also
for
being
light
it
has
a
calorie
count
comparable
to
most
regular
beers
d
you
could
pound
these
back
all
day
eventually
youll
harken
back
to
real
beer
but
its
not
this
beers
fault
how
light
should
a
light
beer
be
the
very
fact
that
on
the
label
boston
beer
co
brags
that
sam
adams
light
took
a
medal
at
a
major
german
beer
tasting
competition
even
though
there
was
no
light
beer
category
begs
the
aforesaid
question
thats
arbitrary
though
i
suppose
as
the
focus
should
be
more
on
flavor
and
drinkability
where
id
say
it
has
friends
in
heineken
becks
and
the
like
dthis
is
my
grab
one
and
drink
it
from
the
bottle
beer
easy
for
me
to
just
pick
up
drink
and
forget
for
a
little
while
that
im
a
compete
beer
snob
however
this
brew
amazed
me
and
i
think
in
the
pantheon
of
light
beers
should
rate
far
higher
than
it
is
here
this
is
light
beer
folks
not
regular
give
it
its
due
it
has
a
firm
almost
nutty
taste
no
skunk
and
a
smooth
mouth
feel
it
pours
a
rich
colour
into
the
glass
rather
like
my
beloved
yuengling
and
frankly
tastes
like
an
old
recipe
lager
it
is
light
in
alcohol
only
4
which
makes
it
a
great
afternoon
beer
its
flavourful
character
will
hold
its
own
with
anything
from
pasta
to
burgers
di
was
still
tasting
this
beer
when
i
realized
it
was
almost
gone
this
drinks
quickly
and
quietly
without
fanfare
but
i
still
think
its
a
great
gateway
beer
to
lead
the
masses
away
from
macros
to
brewtupia
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
twofinger
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
slight
hops
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
hoppy
light
body
drinkable
not
worth
buying
again
though
not
into
light
brews
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
light
beers
you
can
find
nicely
done
for
the
style
overall
good
stuff
that
has
its
place
well
this
is
impossible
not
to
praise
beats
all
other
widely
available
light
beers
hands
down
thing
is
it
is
a
very
tasty
brew
regardless
of
it
being
a
light
beer
easy
drinking
delicious
cheaper
than
craft
beer
and
really
really
refreshing
not
a
bad
light
beer
at
all
amber
in
color
topped
with
just
a
thin
white
head
the
head
fizzles
pretty
quickly
and
little
to
no
lace
is
left
on
the
glass
not
really
a
whole
lot
like
a
regular
boston
ale
or
lager
this
had
a
watery
slightly
sour
taste
and
just
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
flavor
not
really
for
me
but
if
i
feel
like
a
light
beer
or
you
are
looking
for
a
good
light
beer
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
medium
amber
in
color
with
a
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
quickly
fades
away
with
a
small
amount
of
sticky
lace
strong
smell
of
corn
and
corn
husk
but
after
a
while
turning
to
a
slightly
metalic
smell
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
and
it
has
some
flavor
to
it
carbonation
was
a
little
weak
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
this
is
definitely
the
best
light
beer
that
i
have
had
and
it
really
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
if
the
label
didnt
say
it
was
light
then
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
to
be
a
light
beer
all
in
all
it
is
possibly
the
best
light
ever
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
showed
great
life
with
lots
of
bubbles
rushing
to
the
top
this
looks
great
compared
to
most
light
beers
nothing
too
special
in
the
smell
with
wheat
light
hops
and
some
other
grainy
smells
the
taste
was
a
fuller
version
of
the
aroma
with
some
decent
wheat
and
light
hop
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
and
not
very
watery
at
all
this
is
one
of
the
better
light
lagers
ive
tasted
and
very
drinkable
the
light
beer
that
sets
the
bar
for
others
in
the
style
light
beer
drinkers
should
also
see
new
belgiums
skinny
dip
110
calories
and
4
2
alcohol
vs
sam
adams
light
at
124
calories
and
only
4
0
alcohol
overall
the
beer
is
what
it
is
just
a
bettertasting
more
balanced
version
of
a
light
beer
if
ever
i
was
forced
to
drink
a
light
beer
id
definitely
choose
this
over
any
of
the
macro
water
beer
but
its
certainly
no
replacement
for
a
fuller
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
lights
on
the
market
ive
had
this
a
while
back
and
as
luck
would
find
due
one
of
these
snuck
into
my
sammys
variety
pack
light
malty
aroma
nothing
wrong
here
pours
a
nice
light
copper
small
head
little
left
on
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
most
but
still
thin
considering
good
taste
i
prefer
more
but
this
is
a
light
if
you
are
a
worried
beer
drinker
this
may
be
for
you
if
you
enjoy
beer
spend
your
cash
on
the
real
thing
drinkability
im
reviewing
this
as
a
light
beer
and
as
such
it
is
the
best
ive
ever
had
nice
and
refreshing
but
if
your
main
reason
for
drinking
a
light
beer
is
calories
and
not
taste
take
note
of
the
128
calorie
count
drinkability
a
great
beer
to
have
after
a
long
day
of
work
or
after
cutting
the
grass
in
the
summer
warmth
nice
sessionable
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
all
night
if
warranted
certainly
its
the
best
light
beer
ive
ever
had
nice
job
mr
koch
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
it
may
be
light
beer
but
its
actually
pretty
good
pours
a
light
amber
color
very
clear
decent
head
that
goes
away
pretty
quickly
minimal
lacing
smells
of
biscuity
malts
and
a
slight
hop
spice
a
light
beer
that
actually
smells
like
beer
taste
is
also
great
for
a
light
beer
biscuity
malts
followed
by
a
hop
spice
some
vanilla
notes
almost
like
a
watered
down
boston
lager
really
terrific
for
a
light
beer
i
must
say
it
doesnt
have
the
usual
off
flavors
that
accompany
the
rest
crisp
clean
and
actually
some
flavor
in
there
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
clean
finish
very
drinkable
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
mainly
malty
taste
is
toffee
and
bread
i
have
never
seen
a
light
beer
with
this
dark
of
a
color
nor
have
i
ever
had
a
light
beer
with
this
much
flavor
this
is
something
both
macro
and
micro
beer
drinkers
could
agree
on
i
could
drink
these
all
day
highly
recommend
the
beer
poured
with
an
extremely
thin
head
with
some
patchy
lacing
clear
light
amber
color
overall
aromas
had
a
slight
roasty
hint
to
a
generally
bready
and
malty
smell
taste
mirrored
the
aromas
with
a
slight
fruity
and
hoppy
taste
lightly
grassy
and
pretty
sweet
for
a
light
lager
great
carbonation
in
general
very
very
refreshing
light
and
crisp
overall
i
am
not
a
light
beer
drinker
but
this
is
pretty
darn
good
for
one
heres
the
first
light
beer
which
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
i
like
no
offflavors
and
just
enough
of
the
original
goodness
to
keep
on
going
in
many
ways
this
reminded
me
of
a
drier
blonde
ale
though
it
is
certainly
the
best
beer
with
the
word
light
on

i
wouldnt
call
it
the

beer
because
it
isnt
really
a
light
beer
while
it
might
impress
the
initiated
as
a
light
beer
an

drinker
would
find
this
brew
contradictory
to

55overall
for
a
light
beer
this
is
amazing
active
carbonation
quarter
inch
head
but
youre
going
to
drink
this
because
its
low
calorie
a
little
richer
than
your
average
light
brew
taste
is
richer
too
the
hops
are
noticable
and
the
beer
has
a
nice
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
with
drinkability
good
as
is
typical
with
lighter
brews
enolamar

but
still
has
enough
substance
to
make
it
the
best
light
beer
out
there
themaniacalonefeb

but
rather
malty
aromas
the
taste
has
a
very
caramel
malt
flavor
to
it
with
bitterness

minimal
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and

this
is

the

if
feel
the
need
to
drink
a

and
the
taste

its
probably
along
the
same
lines
but
that
is
the
case
for
most
light
beers
overall
this
would
be
the
beer
for

if
you
stack
it
up

would

that

this
would

it
good
flavor
for
the
style
it
pours

mildly

it
doesnt
have
that
annoying

this
is
just
a
nice
clean
but
more
likely
hops
and
the
lack
of
adjunct
flavor
if
i
had
to
choose
between

is

little
bit
of

one
of
the
best
light
beers
but
not
something
id
buy
probably
the
best
light
beer
on
the
market
today
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
resides
after
about
a
minute
lacing
is
fair
the
smell
is
that
of
boston
lager
rather
skunky
with
hints
of
hops
and
malts
the
taste
is
ligh
but
still
malty
and
refreshing
feels
crisp
in
the
mouth
drinkable
if
you
like
the
light
beers
still
go
for
the
original
boston
lager
overall
a
step
up
from
the
macros
in
amount
and
quality
of
flavor
but
i
still
wonder
why
anyone
would
buy
this
i
guess
if
you
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
beer
like
the
taste
a
bit
and
are
not
willing
to
exercise
then
this
would
be
a
good
choice
so
far
i
am
sticking
to
nonlights
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
quickly
fading
head
aroma
is
a
nondescript
blend
of
caramel
and
some
light
herbal
notes
flavor
begins
slightly
sweet
then
somewhat
acidic
with
some
bread
a
herbal
notes
at
the
end
mouthfeels
is
watery
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
i
find
it
hard
to
find
much
to
say
about
this
beer
its
just
well
boring
real
drinkable
if
forced
to
drink
light
beer
choose
this
with
light
beers
dominating
the
conventional
beer
market
its
understandable
that
boston
beer
co
would
want
to
enter
into
the
fray
and
the
like
nationals
this
beer
is
watered
down
bland
and
nondescript
it
will
probably
sell
to
the
masses
nicely
personally
i
preferred
sams
old
lightship
i
was
given
a
christmas
sampler
from
sam
adams
this
year
so
i
found
myself
with
2
lights
to
drink
it
has
a
pale
golden
color
though
it
is
slightly
darker
than
many
other
light
beers
the
aroma
slightly
sweet
but
it
is
barley
there
it
has
a
light
body
and
an
ever
so
slight
bitterness
it
is
fuller
in
body
and
hoppier
than
most
other
lights
but
definitely
not
worth
drinking
dark
straw
body
with
a
cottony
white
head
smells
of
sweet
cereal
malts
with
modest
hops
taste
is
pretty
unremarkablemostly
subdued
malt
accented
by
mild
hops
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
way
better
than
any
other
light
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
still
a
little
lean
and
thin
if
i
want
a
4
light
beer
ill
stick
to
the
utah
micros
i
got
this
one
in
a
mixed
12pack
and
felt
compelled
to
try
it
pours
an
amber
color
with
very
very
high
clarity
head
is
way
too
fizzy
the
beers
texture
is
just
awful
super
high
carbonation
and
fizziness
just
ruins
this
for
me
yeah
theres
a
slight
touch
of
carmelly
malt
flavor
but
its
not
enough
to
mask
the
metallic
finish
and
overcarbonated
body
i
understand
that
its
a
light
beer
but
i
would
actually
prefer
a
pils
style
this
one
just
didnt
work
and
tasted
way
off
balance
id
recommend
it
maybe
if
someone
only
drank
lite
beers
and
wanted
to
taste
a
bit
more
malt
but
cmon
thats
not
enough
of
a
raison
detre
well
it
is
a
light
beer
but
comparing
to
other
light
beers
i
must
say
its
quite
good
for
a
light
beer
i
like
the
apperance
that
it
has
on
it
an
amber
color
compared
to
others
which
have
a
very
pale
yellow
you
can
tell
that
this
beer
actually
uses
hops
and
malts
in
their
beer
even
though
its
light
smell
was
lightly
hoppy
and
a
touch
of
grain
in
there
taste
was
well
light
kinda
watery
compared
to
other
beers
out
there
but
it
did
have
some
taste
to
it
you
can
taste
the
malts
at
least
hey
i
got
this
beer
for
free
i
wont
complain
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
beer
beef
notes
the
times
i
buy
this
will
be
few
and
far
between
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
ill
gladly
drink
it
if
its
given
to
me
it
would
probably
be
quite
refreshing
in
the
summer
as
well
what
a
below
average
beer
see
numbers
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
quickly
dissapearing
head
smell
is
sweet
with
no
hop
aroma
the
flavors
are
pale
stale
and
boring
some
slight
maltiness
in
the
mouthfeel
but
overall
left
me
with
nothing
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
slightly
dry
finish
no
body
to
this
beer
either
as
a
beer
it
beats
out
the
macros
barely
as
a
light
beer
its
about
the
same
as
amstel
drinkabilitynotes
kicks
the
tail
feathers
out
of
any
other
light
beer
ive
had
that
being
said
though
im
not
sure
id
buy
a
whole
case
of
these
but
would
definitely
buy
this
if
it
was
available
in
a
pub
before
i
would
any
other
light
quite
nice
and
my
scores
are
putting
this
beer
vs
the
macro
lights
no
question
an
above
average
light
lager
i
tasted
this
blind
as
a
panelist
at
the
beverage
tasting
institute
here
in
chicago
this
was
a
mystery
brew
and
was
used
as
a
warm
up
to
a
morning
of
tasting
and
reviewing
stouts
and
porters
there
were
4
tasters
and
all
of
us
pegged
this
for
pretty
much
what
it
is
albiet
we
never
would
has
guessed
it
to
be
a
light
beer
most
of
us
thought
it
to
be
a
flavorful
malty
session
brewi
though
it
to
be
a
goose
island
product
flavorful
lighter
in
style
and
priced
right
it
was
kind
of
marzenvienna
in
stylea
simple
yet
well
made
malt
driven
brew
much
suprise
when
we
removed
the
bag
all
of
us
had
to
admit
that
this
was
an
above
average
light
beer
sometimes
the
label
will
fool
us
and
i
bet
i
would
have
reviewed
this
lower
had
i
seen
it
before
tasting
thanks
bti
for
another
bit
of
beer
education
you
could
definitely
pound
the
hell
out
of
these
all
night
too
which
might
save
you
from
the
macros
if
its
cheap
enough
john
pours
out
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
large
white
head
aroma
is
fairly
weak
there
is
a
sort
of
sweat
socks
type
aroma
with
perhaps
a
minor
skunkiness
taste
is
mainly
of
a
sweetish
creamy
malt
some
slight
caramel
tastes
not
much
else
here
decent
mouthfeel
for
a
light
beer
creamy
fairly
drinkable
but
pretty
boring
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
it
has
the
scent
of
pale
malts
and
that
musty
lager
aroma
the
taste
is
light
there
is
a
slight
malt
flavor
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
has
more
taste
than
most
light
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
has
a
low
body
and
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
light
beer
a
real
good
drinker
with
some
flavor
boston
beer
co
has
a
done
a
good
job
of
combining
two
disparate
concepts
light
beer
and
craft
beer
its
not
a
terrible
product
it
has
its
flaws
but
it
is
not
something
to
be
mistaken
for
a
crappy
beer
pours
to
a
white
head
that
dissipates
oh
well
ambergold
color
and
lots
of
carbonation
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
grassy
hops
flavor
is
watery
and
malty
with
a
grassy
noble
hop
tang
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
best
described
as
mineral
waterkind
of
thin
but
chalkyastringent
finishes
dry
and
malty
easy
to
drink
and
not
worry
about
getting
too
a
good
beer
to
have
when
watching
calories
and
alcohol
intake
and
you
care
about
taste
this
would
be
my
beer
of
choice
of
all
light
beers
notes
i
dont
give
a
rats
ass
about
whether
a
beer
is
light
or
not
or
a
brewer
macro
or
not
this
is
not
a
bad
tasting
lager
at
124
calories
and
4
abv
though
the
appellation
light
is
a
tad
misleading
almost
every
4
beer
will
weigh
in
at
about
130
calories
including
the
vastly
superior
pilsner
urquell
drinkabilitynotes
sure
its
light
but
its
just
not
flavorful
enough
to
warrant
a
repeat
imho
while
i
have
been
greatly
impressed
with
the
quality
and
consistency
of
sam
adams
products
this
im
afraid
is
mediocre
even
for
a
light
beer
ill
pass
please
remove
this
from
the
variety
packs
bbc
put
the
boston
ale
back
in
maybe
this
would
belong
in
the
summer
pack
but
i
couldnt
think
of
a
worse
winter
beer
than
a
light
now
here
is
a
light
beer
that
looks
tastes
and
smells
like
real
beer
pleasant
amber
color
and
hoppy
aroma
although
calorie
wise
it
is
on
par
with
bud
or
regular
coors
it
is
much
more
beer
than
either
almost
as
smooth
and
rich
a
regular
sam
adams
a
regular
in
my
fridge
sam
adams
light
is
definitely
the
best
light
lager
beer
out
on
the
market
today
although
i
really
am
not
too
crazy
at
all
about
regular
sam
adams
boston
lager
this
is
really
pretty
good
especially
for
a
light
beer
recommended
to
anyone
who
wants
a
few
beers
and
watch
the
calories
at
the
same
time
who
enjoy
a
damn
good
tasting
beer
pale
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
slight
hints
of
malt
and
hops
in
the
aroma
has
a
dry
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
malty
finish
this
has
gotta
make
the
big
3
drinkers
go
insane
when
they
see
it
in
a
glass
as
its
not
the
standard
pale
yellowy
color
that
one
would
expect
with
a
light
beer
and
this
actually
has
some
taste
to
it
gotta
be
the
best
light
beer
on
the
market
to
date
notes
i
see
theyre
pitching
it
towards
the
college
tools
who
drink
what
theyre
told
to
drink
hmm
what
a
paradox
drinkability
easydrinking
and
quite
palatable
not
as
exciting
as
their
flagship
brew
but
still
respectable
i
am
torn
here
i
love
sam
adams
beers
but
hate
light
beers
i
understand
why
they
have
brewed
this
beer
and
dont
hold
it
against
them
it
is
better
than
most
light
beers
i
have
sampled
a
mediocre
brew
that
was
brewed
to
be
that
way
although
i
appreciate
the
lack
of
adjuncts
note
to
jim
koch
dont
put
this
in
the
winter
classics
pack
i
have
been
buying
your
winter
classics
for
9
years
now
and
this
is
not
a
winter
beer
put
it
in
all
the
other
12packs
but
leave
the
winter
pack
be
put
your
scotch
ale
in
there
instead
or
better
yet
bring
back
honey
porter
i
tasted
this
on
two
occasionsonce
side
by
side
with
miller
lite
and
bud
light
the
second
time
with
mgd
and
coors
with
the
lights
it
stood
easily
on
top
much
darker
color
much
bolder
aroma
and
definitely
a
better
taste
with
the
regular
beers
this
tasted
very
ordinary
i
guess
light
is
just
light
there
are
beers
that
taste
good
for
a
light
but
not
lights
that
taste
great
as
a
beer
compared
to
anything
that
i
have
ever
tried
in
the
light
beer
category
this
wins
hands
down
tastes
like
a
fullflavored
beer
with
a
little
water
added
while
other
lights
taste
like
water
with
a
hint
of
beer
flavor
and
alcohol
very
worth
buying
and
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
by
far
the
best
light
beer
i
have
had
i
liked
the
maltiness
rather
than
the
hoppiness
of
it
it
was
a
darker
shade
than
most
lighter
beers
but
then
again
its
sam
adams
the
head
lasted
a
few
minutes
and
was
light
colored
i
got
it
at
red
lobster
which
sucks
anyways
so
it
was
a
highlight
of
the
meal
i
am
defaintley
going
to
recomend
this
one
to
all
my
bros
and
biotches
gotta
keep
the
scene
alive
id
would
make
this
a
keep
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
for
when
the
guys
come
over
type
of
beer
it
is
a
tolerable
beer
for
the
most
part
by
swillers
and
bas
good
beer
to
bridge
the
gap
i
understand
the
market
for
a
light
beer
from
sam
adams
but
i
wasnt
impressed
with
it
i
bought
a
six
pack
when
it
first
came
out
and
i
really
had
a
hard
time
finishing
all
six
better
than
average
light
beers
out
there
but
why
taste
wasnt
that
good
and
that
caused
drinkability
to
suffer
ill
stick
with
the
lighter
sa
beersvienna
summer
ale
etc
medium
gold
color
small
head
aroma
is
grassy
and
sweet
light
malts
some
hoppyness
has
the
feel
of
a
light
beer
but
has
some
flavor
to
it
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
but
as
a
regular
beer
its
a
little
weak
it
is
after
all
a
light
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
nice
beer
for
a
light
im
not
a
light
beer
drinker
but
i
dont
mind
having
a
few
sam
adams
lights
every
once
in
a
while
would
i
have
it
again
sure
just
not
all
the
time
this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
light
beers
out
there
even
though
it
is
really
a
borderline
light
beer
with
high
calorie
content
that
is
too
bad
it
isnt
somewhat
cheaper
as
it
would
have
a
constant
presence
in
my
fridge
my
hunch
is
that
it
was
designed
and
marketed
for
the
beautiful
people
who
visit
the
gyms
and
are
watching
their
wastlines
poor
sods
a
small
offwhite
coarse
head
on
a
clear
darkish
amber
beer
interesting
color
for
a
light
beer
smell
is
lagery
sweetish
a
little
nutty
good
lotsa
nuts
in
the
front
fruit
and
malt
in
the
middle
major
nuttiness
again
in
the
finish
this
is
very
very
good
for
a
light
beer
for
a
light
beer
it
does
the
commercials
justice
on
the
other
hand
im
inclined
to
regard
it
in
the
same
manner
i
do
every
other
nonlight
beer
it
certainly
raises
the
bar
about
a
mile
and
a
half
for
light
beers
but
it
probably
wont
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
until
it
can
compete
pricewise
with
other
lights
flavor
is
a
touch
watered
down
although
still
fairly
flavorful
clean
malts
with
some
mild
german
hopping
taking
up
the
back
providing
a
crisp
finish
somewhat
grainy
body
is
very
light
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
not
bad
certainly
not
something
ill
make
a
habit
of
but
great
for
a
light
beer
as
far
as
light
beers
goes
its
easily
one
of
the
most
flavorful
but
id
almost
rather
drink
a
macro
light
simply
because
youre
not
taunted
by
how
good
it
could
be
by
far
my
favorite
light
beer
pours
a
orangegold
color
with
light
to
mediium
headaroma
is
slightly
bready
like
malt
aroma
taste
has
a
good
hop
flavor
for
a
light
beer
with
a
good
malty
smack
in
the
finish
good
mouthfeel
for
a
light
beer
as
welland
can
drink
many
of
these
without
feeling
full
its
a
light
beer
take
it
for
what
it
is
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
offering
from
the
boston
beer
company
light
a
fizzy
this
brew
did
not
pack
much
flavor
at
all
now
of
course
it
is
cleary
better
then
most
mass
produced
swill
but
as
for
a
person
who
enjoys
beer
there
are
tons
more
beer
that
are
light
but
offer
much
more
in
the
way
of
flavor
this
one
had
some
malt
and
hops
that
provided
some
bittering
flavor
but
this
really
tasted
like
someone
watered
down
a
boston
lager
this
beer
is
obviously
valuable
to
some
but
it
really
is
not
in
the
same
category
as
their
other
beers
and
ales
just
my
opinion
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
finely
sized
white
bubbles
and
a
transparent
light
amber
brown
body
the
head
faded
away
fairly
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
it
has
a
very
mild
unnoticeable
aroma
its
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
fizzy
side
and
that
of
mild
hops
it
was
fairly
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
foretaste
and
a
mild
lingering
hop
aftertaste
i
used
to
drink
this
years
ago
when
it
was
called
lightship
this
is
probably
the
best
light
beer
you
can
get
right
now
basically
a
lighter
version
of
their
boston
lager
color
is
almost
the
same
as
the
b
l
medium
copper
with
minimal
head
aroma
still
not
bad
even
after
being
watered
down
some
malt
and
hops
there
crisp
and
refreshing
with
some
decent
flavor
for
a
light
mouthfeel
as
expected
is
thin
drinkability
may
be
fairly
high
but
tasteablity
isnt
pours
a
medium
amber
color
topped
by
a
white
head
that
displays
pretty
good
retention
sweet
grainy
aroma
is
fairly
one
dimensional
the
taste
is
actually
fairly
malty
without
the
stronger
sweetness
seen
in
the
boston
lager
something
resembling
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
it
quickly
disappears
mouthfeel
is
decent
for
a
nearmacro
drinakbility
is
also
pretty
good
although
the
overall
mild
flavor
doesnt
prod
me
to
drink
more
id
have
to
say
its
my
second
favorite
light
lager
behind
saranac
and
it
didnt
make
me
scream
like
an
idiot
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
darker
amber
than
would
be
expected
from
a
light
beer
very
good
head
that
stuck
around
and
some
fine
lacing
that
also
lasted
till
the
end
aroma
was
very
light
malt
and
no
hops
taste
was
the
same
light
and
slightly
sweet
not
to
fizzy
and
very
smooth
enjoyable
but
i
still
prefer
something
more
substantial
mmmm
beer
homer
simpson
pours
darker
than
most
light
beers
a
light
amber
would
be
a
good
description
the
head
came
and
went
within
a
blink
of
the
eye
this
brew
also
left
no
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
bit
sweet
with
malt
and
little
to
none
on
the
hops
the
flavor
was
a
watered
down
version
of
its
big
brother
a
sweet
malty
start
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
end
with
hops
compare
to
other
light
beers
this
one
is
much
better
so
as
a
light
beer

a
bit
above
average
12
oz
brown
bottle
pours
a
pale
amber
with
little
head
its
darker
than
you
would
expect
with
a
light
beer
i
dont
know
that
its
really
light
at
all
in
fact
as
opposed
to
most
micros
yes
as
opposed
to
most
macros
certainly
not
if
you
must
get
a
light
beer
i
say
definitely
get
this
one
the
taste
has
decent
balance
tilted
to
the
malty
side
but
there
is
hop
presence
dry
aftertaste
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
just
want
a
beer
skip
it
if
you
want
a
light
beer
it
would
be
hard
to
beat
it
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
with
this
particular
beer
i
could
not
determine
what
the
aroma
was
in
this
beer
it
had
a
watery
taste
to
it
there
was
no
bitterness
or
aftertaste
noted
with
this
beer
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
with
this
beer
a
bit
of
a
pale
amber
in
color
fizzy
with
a
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
the
carbonation
leaves
this
beer
quickly
as
it
almost
flat
after
the
head
goes
away
the
aroma
is
rather
bland
and
thin
i
only
get
a
little
bit
of
malts
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
taste
has
a
little
body
to
it
really
tastes
like
a
watered
down
sam
adams
comparing
it
to
most
light
beers
it
is
better
there
is
no
compelling
reason
to
buy
this
i
would
say
that
it
is
best
as
probably
a
chick
beer
came
in
with
the
holiday
gift
pack
a
present
this
light
beer
beats
the
shit
out
of
the
other
us
macro
shit
light
beers
this
isnt
watered
down
it
has
flavor
and
it
has
character
if
this
were
a
regular
beer
it
would
be
an
average
beer
it
pours
out
amber
with
a
medium
off
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
giving
this
a
crisp
mouthfeel
aroma
is
of
strong
malt
charteristics
with
some
hop
backround
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
drinkability
is
good
got
this
at
a
friends
party
he
got
this
to
try
and
convert
all
the
other
light
beer
drinkers
to
try
something
new
some
liked
it
some
did
not
it
was
a
good
way
of
trying
to
convert
people
to
drink
a
better
tasting
beer
this
is
a
good
light
beer
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
by
a
sixer
deep
gold
in
color
with
a
nice
white
fizzy
head
light
slightly
ryebready
herbal
malt
floral
hop
aroma
with
a
light
sweet
malt
fragrance
fairly
high
in
metallic
and
light
citrus
hops
malty
for
a
light
imho
the
best
light
beer
to
date
that
ive
tried
alright
i
had
to
try
itonly
because
it
was
mixed
in
the
winter
sampler
pack
and
if
i
threw
it
out
it
would
be
alcohol
abuse
i
was
surprised
it
was
actually
a
decent
light
beer
much
better
that
any
other
light
american
beer
that
ive
had
pours
a
light
copper
color
topped
off
with
a
12inch
white
head
that
slowly
fades
away
leaving
a
thin
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
moderate
amount
of
toasted
malt
and
hops
with
just
a
slight
sweetness
of
caramel
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
even
though
im
not
much
of
a
light
beer
drinker
i
will
definitely
keep
this
one
in
mind
believe
this
to
be
the
best
light
that
i
have
ever
tasted
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
patchy
head
that
keeps
very
well
does
not
look
like
any
light
beer
ive
come
across
appears
dark
in
color
for
a
light
beer
as
the
bottle
states
two
row
malt
and
cascading
hops
these
seem
to
be
very
well
balanced
the
taste
of
malt
grain
and
a
bit
chalky
is
followed
by
just
a
bit
of
a
watery
taste
clearly
the
best
light
beer
ive
sampled
probably
a
good
marketing
tactic
for
future
converts
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
with
a
fair
head
that
lasted
for
some
time
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
better
than
the
macro
beers
but
i
dont
know
for
sure
if
that
is
true
the
aroma
was
mild
at
best
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
equally
non
memorable
i
bought
this
to
eat
with
a
salad
and
red
beans
and
rice
it
completmented
the
meal
without
taking
the
lead
i
guess
that
is
what
i
wanted
from
this
beer
theres
not
really
any
advantage
to
pouring
it
from
the
bottle
to
a
glass
but
i
secretly
enjoy
drinking
from
the
bottle
now
and
then
better
to
do
it
with
a
beer
that
wont
blossom
when
poured
into
the
appropriate
glass
honestly
im
concerned
that
this
beer
became
overheated
in
the
delivery
truck
im
a
longtime
fan
of
boston
beer
and
this
is
the
most
disappointed
ive
ever
been
with
them
it
pours
with
decient
head
which
goes
down
in
seconds
it
is
amber
in
color
but
lacks
richness
faint
smell
of
hopps
followed
by
a
watery
taste
that
is
common
to
american
lagers
that
are
produced
in
mass
quantity
the
finish
is
the
worst
part
of
the
beer
intruducing
flavors
that
i
am
conviced
are
derived
from
rice
or
corn
insead
of
malts
and
hopps
rather
pleasing
hoppy
aroma
especially
for
a
light
with
a
light
malt
backing
amber
clear
medium
fizzy
head
with
left
fairly
quickly
light
overall
tasteas
would
be
expected
but
some
nice
hop
characteristics
with
malt
backing
again
short
finish
but
not
unpleasant
fairly
thin
but
some
fullness
from
the
amount
of
carbonation
certainly
better
that
any
light
ive
ever
had
has
a
sweetwater
smell
and
taste
of
nas
yet
not
too
much
could
maybe
even
settle
for
this
if
i
had
too
well
luckilly
i
am
aallowed
one
proper
beer
a
week
i
suppose
this
stuff
is
slightly
better
than
most
lights
so
looks
like
i
will
be
sticking
to
this
pours
a
reddish
gold
with
an
average
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
to
a
cling
ring
floral
hop
aroma
stands
out
decent
hop
bite
and
surprisingly
well
balanced
probably
the
best
light
beer
ive
tried
so
far
doesnt
taste
as
watered
down
as
all
of
the
other
offerings
out
there
better
than
average
for
a
light
but
go
for
the
extra
calories
you
really
arent
saving
that
much
surprisingly
dark
amber
color
with
a
soft
cottony
head
that
stretches
into
fine
lace
with
some
irregularities
the
nose
is
unusual
there
is
a
suggestion
of
toasty
caramelized
malts
but
they
come
across
weakly
in
combination
with
elements
of
overripe
lemons
on
the
palate
it
is
indeed
light
finishing
within
seconds
leaving
a
pleasant
clear
aftertaste
of
brown
bread
and
water
i
find
no
flaw
with
this
beer
in
terms
of
how
it
was
executed
stylistically
it
seems
to
strain
to
pull
all
of
the
flavor
elements
together
can
rich
anglo
beer
flavor
work
in
a
light
format
probably
never
as
well
as
northern
european
pilsner
the
pour
a
typical
limpid
golden
amber
color
the
head
masterful
in
size
and
frothy
in
texture
with
the
left
over
lace
a
nice
clinging
sheet
nose
is
all
malt
crisp
clean
and
fresh
quite
pleasant
overall
start
is
lightly
sweet
with
plenty
of
malt
the
top
skeletal
the
finish
is
biting
in
its
acidity
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
very
dry
aftertaste
drinkable
and
something
for
the
days
this
summer
when
it
is
115
degrees
outside
perhaps
bbc
has
created
a
new
niche
of
beers
how
favorably
the
public
responds
to
it
should
be
interesting
pours
a
bright
clear
amber
color
with
solid
carbonation
small
white
lace
on
the
nose
the
aroma
is
fairly
clean
slight
grain
on
the
palate
the
flavors
are
all
mild
light
grain
notes
slight
sweetness
slight
fizzy
mouthfeel
light
caramel
maybe
and
soft
hop
citrus
flavors
as
well
this
is
hands
down
the
best
light
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
but
i
havent
tasted
many
poured
a
head
that
dissapeared
within
seconds
to
nothing
the
color
is
an
orangered
a
mild
hop
aroma
with
a
weird
smell
of
pond
water
or
the
smell
the
outside
after
it
rains
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
fizzy
taste
a
slight
hop
taste
with
a
wheaty
finish
a
light
bodied
beer
with
very
little
malt
texture
the
taste
is
really
bad
overall
i
really
cant
believe
sam
adams
would
lower
themselves
in
putting
out
a
light
beer
that
tastes
as
bad
as
this
it
really
lowered
my
perception
of
sam
adams
ok
enough
complaining
the
fact
is
this
really
surprised
me
this
beer
didnt
suck
it
was
the
last
thing
left
cold
in
the
fridge
so
rather
than
wait
i
went
ahead
and
tried
it
this
beer
is
a
lighter
beer
for
sure
and
it
may
compare
to
a
lot
of
other
lights
in
color
and
nose
and
calories
but
that
is
where
is
stops
most
light
beers
in
the
u
s
are
watered
down
beers
that
also
kill
the
flavor
boston
beer
company
has
compensated
for
that
by
adding
hops
to
this
one
this
is
more
like
a
lager
in
taste
but
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
that
is
characteristic
of
a
light
beer
if
you
are
a
beer
fan
and
you
like
most
of
us
have
to
count
calories
periodically
this
is
a
good
compromise
beer
i
would
burst
into
flame
the
minute
i
drank
a
bud
or
miller
lite
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
clear
goldenamber
color
to
be
honest
the
color
surprised
me
it
was
darker
then
i
thought
it
would
be
like
coors
light
miller
light
etc
no
head
except
for
a
small
skin
on
the
top
white
in
color
again
surprised
when
i
saw
lace
left
behind
the
aroma
was
light
with
some
grains
and
hops
floral
the
taste
was
also
light
it
had
hints
of
sweet
malt
grains
and
hops
at
the
end
a
well
carbonated
creamy
beer
in
the
middle
and
dry
and
crisp
at
the
end
for
this
type
of
beer
i
say
good
job
a
very
hard
beer
to
rate
would
i
prefer
just
about
any
other
bbc
brew
to
sa
light
yes
is
this
10
times
better
than
any
other
light
beer
ive
ever
had
yes
that
said
its
an
excellent
light
beer
as
light
beers
go
theres
actually
a
bit
of
flavour
and
colour
here
very
smooth
going
down
id
like
to
see
the
boston
ale
or
better
yet
bring
back
the
scotch
ale
one
of
the
best
sams
ever
back
in
the
winter
classics
12
pk
instead
of
sa
light
but
i
certainly
wont
mind
having
to
drink
this
one
if
you
like
sam
adams
save
yourself
the
calories
and
try
it
if
you
dont
like
sa
this
wont
win
you
over
for
a
light
beer
this
beer
does
a
far
better
job
than
others
in
the
category
of
actually
tasting
like
i
feel
beer
should
not
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
or
seek
out
the
sample
was
included
in
a
winter
sampler
12
pack
but
if
you
know
someone
who
drinks
light
beer
and
would
like
to
expand
their
palate
you
couldnt
go
wrong
showing
them
this
beer
musty
cardboard
nose
oxidation
light
clear
amber
color
with
a
slight
white
head
no
detectable
hop
flavor
and
very
little
malt
base
slightly
more
mouth
that
other
light
beers
overall
not
to
usual
sa
standards
i
expected
some
hop
taste
this
was
just
watery
better
than
drinking
watery
light
beers
but
id
rather
take
the
extra
calories
and
have
a
boston
lager
goldem
amber
with
moderage
head
and
fizziness
crisp
malteness
highlights
the
first
taste
with
a
slight
dose
of
dry
hoppiness
to
round
out
the
brew
not
quite
the
beer
ive
expected
sam
adams
tried
to
keep
the
full
figured
reinheitsgebot
thing
going
but
still
keeping
a
lower
cal
beer
i
think
there
are
better
lighter
beers
out
there
and
at
128
callories
this
really
isnt
that
light
ok
a
tough
one
to
call
pours
with
a
big
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
bit
of
malty
smell
which
is
an
accomplishment
for
a
lite
beer
slightly
citrus
and
metallic
taste
with
some
malty
flavor
has
some
character
compared
to
other
lite
beers
i
give
it
slightly
higher
marks
for
being
good
in
its
style
it
is
not
a
3
5
beer
vs
others
out
of
this
style
as
they
say
lite
beers
are
like
making
love
in
a
canoe
fing
close
to
water
the
two
from
the
winter
classics
variety
pack
will
be
it
for
me
this
beer
sort
of
marked
a
change
in
philosophy
for
sammy
and
i
dont
like
the
way
it
is
going
pours
to
a
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
nose
is
of
light
caramel
malt
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
little
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
it
is
light
in
body
and
smooth
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
very
nice
surprise
in
comparison
to
your
typical
americal
light
lagers
if
i
were
to
choose
an
american
light
lager
to
drink
this
would
be
the
one
421
decent
clear
amber
color
18
inch
head
settles
to
a
skim
in
25
seconds
slight
hop
to
the
very
reserved
aroma
watery
flavor
malt
is
decent
and
slightly
brown
sugar
but
quickly
fades
from
the
flavor
the
hops
are
nice
and
english
pollenlike
floral
not
like
macro
extract
copouts
in
quick
and
cheap
impression
this
beer
has
a
good
finish
but
its
the
mid
mouth
pause
between
malt
and
hop
that
just
doesnt
cut
it
or
identify
it
as
a
good
beer
i
guess
its
the
best
botique
light
ive
had
so
far
amstel
saranac
leinenkugels
amber
light
but
ehhh
why
a
light
beer
with
flavor
see
it
can
be
done
definitely
the
best
i
have
ever
had
in
the
style
full
of
flavor
for
a
lite
and
even
when
compared
to
regular
macros
i
am
not
a
big
light
beer
guy
if
i
have
a
light
beer
it
is
amstel
but
behold
america
answers
the
call
this
is
the
first
american
light
beer
i
can
drink
it
is
amlost
as
goo
as
regular
samys
but
you
can
tell
it
is
lighter
first
it
wont
fill
up
as
quickly
second
it
is
a
little
lighter
in
color
this
is
as
close
as
america
will
come
to
a
truely
europian
light
beer
ladies
also
drink
alot
of
it
too
whwich
is
a
big
plus
this
is
a
truely
though
a
manly
beer
just
take
of
the
light
an
you
are
good
to
go
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
amble
amount
of
head
that
goes
dowm
pretty
fast
leaving
no
trace
of
head
there
is
also
no
noticable
lace
the
auroma
contians
no
noticable
smells
the
taste
is
is
very
good
for
a
light
beer
i
would
have
no
trouble
drinking
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
but
dont
think
i
will
be
buying
this
beer
again
not
a
bad
brew
this
sam
adams
light
i
will
have
to
keep
this
one
in
mind
the
next
time
im
doing
the
lights
a
good
beer
for
people
that
believe
the
hype
so
it
has
more
flavor
than
your
typical
american
light
who
cares
bbc
didnt
think
they
could
join
the
market
share
scrum
without
a
beer
that
had
the
word
light
in
its
name
but
it
all
weighs
the
same
to
me
what
decent
beer
is
the
next
victim
when
the
ad
campaign
does
its
job
and
production
of
light
takes
priority
sam
has
replaced
the
oldtimey
knit
shirt
and
vest
for
a
darkblue
suit
and
red
power
tie
so
long
old
friend
this
beer
is
light
amber
in
the
glass
darker
than
any
light
beer
ive
ever
seen
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
quickly
disappears
almost
no
smell
at
all
malt
flavor
dominates
hops
are
muted
but
evident
and
theres
a
slightly
metallic
quality
to
the
finish
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
kudos
to
sa
for
producing
an
adjunctfree
light
beer
but
as
has
been
pointed
out
many
times
before
the
caloric
difference
between
light
beers
and
regular
versions
of
lighter
styles
is
minimal
so
why
bother
cheers
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
very
dark
for
a
light
beer
aroma
is
sweet
malts
and
grains
with
some
floral
notes
very
malty
flavor
especially
for
a
light
beer
and
is
crisp
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
this
is
one
of
the
best
light
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
i
really
dont
think
its
fair
to
say
this
is
only
a
lighter
version
of
sa
boston
lager
after
trying
the
two
back
to
back
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
the
flavor
charcteristics
of
each
light
is
obviously
much
more
bland
compared
to
the
regular
but
between
miller
lite
and
coors
light
the
better
tasting
sam
adams
light
definitely
gets
my
vote
nice
amber
color
with
a
quick
lived
head
and
a
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
malt
the
flavor
is
light
smooth
malty
sweet
crisp
and
grainy
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
caramel
flavor
the
body
is
light
not
watery
overall
this
is
a
good
light
beer
now
for
my
opinion
ill
never
buy
this
again
and
i
cant
ever
see
myself
in
the
situation
where
this
is
the
best
on
the
list
surely
if
they
have
sa
light
they
will
at
least
have
regular
sa
lager
so
i
would
choose
the
lager
why
does
sa
make
this
stuff
well
its
not
for
us
bas
obviously
trying
to
please
everyone
cant
say
i
wouldnt
do
the
same
if
it
were
my
business
but
id
like
to
think
that
i
would
not
cheers
pure
transparent
amber
color
with
a
white
head
thats
nearly
gone
in
no
time
only
a
thin
lace
stays
unexpectedly
big
aroma
for
a
light
sharply
sweet
malt
with
a
little
hop
character
as
for
the
flavor
more
big
yet
soft
malty
sweetness
a
pretty
big
dose
of
it
for
a
light
beer
but
still
far
from
powerful
its
got
a
metallic
sweetness
to
it
as
well
which
i
dont
like
hops
appear
in
a
lingering
tingly
bitterness
that
roams
about
the
tongue
more
sweet
grain
in
the
finish
as
expected
its
pretty
much
a
watereddown
version
of
boston
lager
but
it
is
a
bit
different
the
malt
is
much
sweeter
and
just
too
metallic
it
almost
has
a
corn
sweetness
but
i
dont
really
want
to
get
into
that
territory
im
not
saying
they
used
adjuncts
definitely
good
for
a
light
beer
but
the
key
phrase
there
is
for
a
light
beer
id
much
rather
have
a
boston
lager
however
for
the
macroswillerslight
beer
drinkers
this
could
be
a
turning
point
aside
note
observation
once
the
shockingly
great
taste
subsides
and
you
revisit
this
beer
in
the
future
you
will
be
disappointed
it
really
is
not
that
good
once
you
know
what
to
expect
you
notice
how
thin
it
is
you
notice
the
overly
leafy
tealike
taste
and
you
notice
the
obviously
low
alcohol
content
you
notice
the
flaws
just
like
the
boston
lager
with
a
less
prevalent
taste
but
the
taste
kicks
in
at
the
end
a
good
beer
for
when
you
dont
want
to
get
full
but
still
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
sam
adams
varieties
not
bad
if
you
just
want
a
good
beer
but
dont
want
to
be
filled
up
or
excessively
drunk
still
a
better
alternative
than
bud
light
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
its
a
light
and
its
good
i
usually
can
not
stand
a
light
beer
and
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
again
when
i
dont
fell
like
getting
filled
up
it
pours
little
head
which
disappates
in
a
few
minutes
leaving
no
lace
on
the
glass
carbonated
rather
heavily
with
big
fluffy
bubbles
nerofiddled
noted
its
slightly
sweet
carmel
flavor
i
agree
it
is
the
primary
taste
of
this
brew
has
secondary
mellow
malt
flavors
if
any
thing
is
the
beer
drinkers
light
beer
if
such
a
think
exsists
as
i
think
that
is
an
oxymoron
this
not
amstel
is
crystal
clear
rich
amber
in
color
with
a
big
bubbled
offwhite
head
that
drops
quickly
and
soon
dissolves
to
nothing
not
a
great
appearance
but
at
least
the
head
didnt
immediately
disappear
like
a
coors
light
the
aroma
offers
a
lightly
sweet
caramel
maltiness
and
very
subdued
hops
the
body
is
surprisingly
firm
for
a
light
beer
mediumlight
and
its
not
watery
at
all
it
starts
off
with
a
fairly
crisp
carbonation
but
loses
quite
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
fortunately
that
allows
some
more
of
the
flavor
to
come
through
displaying
a
surprising
amount
of
sweet
caramel
maltiness
the
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
are
understandably
wellheeled
it
finishes
lightly
sweet
at
first
but
quickly
dries
out
with
a
light
touch
of
hop
similar
to
many
other
lights
and
even
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
nonalcoholic
beer
much
better
than
id
expected
my
new
favorite
light
beer
this
beer
is
almost
a
copper
color
very
clear
interesting
tone
for
a
light
beer
a
thin
head
recedes
to
a
thin
film
quickly
and
then
sticks
around
for
a
while
decent
maltiness
and
noble
hop
aroma
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
too
carbonated
for
me
to
give
it
a
good
rating
in
the
drinkablility
category
pretty
big
body
for
a
light
beer
though
maybe
a
little
better
than
medium
the
taste
is
a
notch
above
most
macro
brewed
light
beers
but
its
not
that
much
better
the
noble
hops
make
their
presence
known
only
with
a
slight
spiciness
the
malt
backing
is
o
k
for
a
light
beer
this
is
decent
still
not
enough
taste
in
it
to
make
it
very
enjoyable
as
a
producer
of
betterthanaverage
beers
sammy
takes
a
risk
in
jumping
into
the
light
beer
market
segment
they
can
set
the
standard
for
light
beers
proving
that
taste
and
light
are
not
mutually
exclusive
terms
or
they
can
produce
yet
another
dumbeddown
beer
to
appeal
to
the
widest
audience
possible
i
was
hoping
for
the
former
but
looks
like
we
got
the
latter
not
to
say
that
this
was
as
bad
as
most
lights
but
i
expected
more
light
golden
color
some
sweet
grain
in
the
nose
flavor
was
a
little
course
with
grain
flavors
and
the
hopping
while
i
could
tell
it
was
sammys
was
too
light
to
punch
up
this
beer
leaving
it
weak
and
flaccid
if
the
choice
is
this
or
some
other
light
beer
ill
take
this
but
if
i
have
any
other
decent
choice
ill
pass
there
is
too
much
carbonation
here
for
me
to
even
enjoy
the
flavor
of
sams
light
but
it
redeems
itself
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
lite
beer
that
tastes
a
little
better
than
a
typical
american
lager
bright
golden
color
with
a
low
head
that
virtually
disappears
suprising
nice
light
hop
and
light
malt
aroma
balance
light
malt
flavor
with
a
decent
balanced
flavor
certainly
not
as
hoppy
as
sa
boston
lager
i
found
the
taste
and
finish
to
be
a
bit
metallic
tin
light
bodied
but
creamy
compared
to
the
budmilcor
light
beers
i
do
not
concern
myself
with
the
caloric
content
of
beer
so
the
fact
that
this
is
a
light
beer
would
not
cause
me
to
buy
it
again
however
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
drink
again
it
also
might
serve
to
gently
introduce
friends
to
the
universe
of
better
beer
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
little
white
head
tastes
maltier
hoppier
than
any
light
beer
i
have
tried
not
a
bad
beer
i
am
sure
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
if
you
put
aside
all
bias
towards
or
against
bbc
you
have
to
admit
its
not
bad
i
think
that
this
beer
is
a
worthy
option
for
light
beer
drinkers
it
is
my
personal
opinion
that
the
boston
beer
company
actually
deserves
some
respect
they
carried
through
with
consistency
and
quality
that
they
are
known
for
rather
than
just
dismissing
this
as
a
light
beer
that
doesnt
need
to
be
contended
with
i
value
that
brand
of
integrity
dark
deep
golden
color
thin
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
no
lace
light
toasted
caramel
malt
aromas
with
a
light
hop
balance
tastes
ok
more
flavor
than
any
other
light
beer
ive
ever
had
not
to
mention
more
flavor
than
most
domestic
heavy
lagers
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
not
a
beer
to
overanalyze
just
to
enjoy
and
thank
the
beer
gods
that
someone
came
up
with
a
light
beer
worth
drinking
not
worth
the
price
though
i
hope
sa
gets
their
cut
of
the
light
beer
drinking
market
and
maybe
will
change
a
few
minds
about
what
beer
can
and
should
be
was
prepared
to
jump
on
the
antibbc
bandwagon
seeing
the
comercials
and
all
has
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
whispy
white
head
does
have
taste
almost
like
a
good
summer
beer
i
am
not
a
big
of
lights
but
will
not
turn
down
an
offer
of
one
of
these
buying
one
however
is
another
matter
but
it
is
a
great
pick
for
thirstquenching
without
coming
across
as
too
heavy
big
thumbsup
here
crystal
clear
copper
hue
covered
by
a
fluffy
two
fingered
ivory
white
head
that
manages
lace
much
more
enticing
in
appearance
versus
the
typical
insipid
light
light
caramel
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
toasty
malt
in
aroma
along
with
a
very
mild
floral
hop
nose
bland
but
above
average
characterwise
aromawise
for
a
light
unfortunately
flavorwise
this
brew
falls
prey
to
the
typical
dearth
in
flavor
of
a
typical
light
and
is
both
thin
in
body
and
malt
character
sweetness
is
caramel
malt
derived
and
hints
of
dry
toasty
malt
provide
character
a
bit
above
the
norm
for
a
light
hop
bitterness
is
above
the
norm
and
provides
a
crisp
quenching
feel
paltry
mittelfruh
hop
flavor
eeks
its
way
in
but
isnt
assertive
enough
to
prevent
overall
blandness
very
well
attenuated
and
dry
overall
w
a
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
w
trace
biscuity
malt
briefly
lingering
sa
light
tastes
like
a
boston
lager
diluted
with
seltzer
water
although
perhaps
the
most
flavorful
light
ive
tasted
its
still
very
much
a
lackluster
beer
still
i
challenge
anyone
to
find
me
a
better
tasting
light
beer
notes
this
is
a
light
beer
that
is
sure
to
revolutionize
the
perception
of
light
beers
okay
no
its
not
and
its
not
even
really
a
light
beer
sam
adams
light
is
full
of
flavour
colour
and
aroma
at
128
calories
no
different
than
most
nonlight
beers
per
12oz
serving
its
also
made
from
tworow
barley
and
100
noble
hops
unlike
other
light
beers
that
are
chuck
full
of
adjuncts
and
sometimes
other
icky
things
in
the
light
category
this
is
at
the
top
hence
my
rating
but
as
a
beer
this
is
something
that
i
would
not
normally
buy
unlike
other
light
beers
its
better
than
bad
however
at
124
calories
its
not
as
light
as
miller
lt
or
amstel
lt
96
95
cals
its
pretty
dark
for
a
light
beer
a
nice
dark
gold
average
head
and
sweet
aroma
with
some
hops
noticable
malty
and
grainy
in
taste
the
hops
are
there
too
good
job
jim
this
pours
a
very
pleasantly
surprising
clear
copper
color
with
a
better
than
expected
white
head
smell
had
the
characteristic
sam
adams
2
row
barley
malt
and
decent
hops
as
well
very
much
in
the
boston
lager
tradition
taste
was
creamy
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
enough
barley
and
crisp
dry
finish
to
make
this
taste
like
a
beer
easily
the
best
light
beer
i
have
had
a
pleasant
surprise
and
another
winning
product
for
the
boston
beer
co
jim
koch
did
it
again
and
as
usual
has
yet
to
disappoint
good
looking
brew
dark
amber
in
color
very
nice
head
ok
on
lace
i
dont
know
other
light
beers
so
i
cant
compair
fairly
it
is
drinkable
with
alittle
hop
smell
but
to
me
its
no
boston
lager
it
falls
short
on
finish
with
no
hop
kick
and
leaves
mouth
with
a
foamlike
feel
its
ok
for
someone
who
dosnt
know
sam
adams
we
that
do
its
alittle
light
then
again
thats
its
purpose
wow
a
light
beer
with
some
flavor
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
and
doesnt
have
that
typical
light
beer
watereddown
taste
i
can
see
why
it
is
such
a
hit
it
is
not
fantastic
but
there
is
probably
not
a
better
american
light
beer
out
there
it
has
more
flavor
than
your
average
light
which
doesnt
mean
much
but
what
can
you
really
expect
anyway
it
was
good
extremely
smooth
for
a
light
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
taste
beats
any
other
american
light
beer
i
have
had
to
date
very
faint
hops
in
both
smell
and
aftertaste
a
very
nice
light
beer
and
its
quite
easy
to
drink
2
or
30
of
them
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
better
than
average
light
beer
a
little
more
flavor
than
is
the
norm
for
lighter
fare
and
a
much
nicer
color
hint
of
caramel
aftertaste
as
well
i
still
wouldnt
classify
it
as
a
revolution
pours
with
an
attractive
amber
color
and
a
respectable
white
head
faint
hop
aroma
i
expected
more
from
the
taste
however
with
very
little
body
the
beer
lacked
a
satisfying
fullness
granted
this
is
better
than
all
other
light
beers
ive
had
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
standards
of
the
brand
copper
amber
body
lots
of
carbonation
large
white
head
of
micro
bubbles
which
quickly
settles
to
halfinch
decent
lacing
both
floral
and
citrus
notes
in
aroma
some
of
the
sam
lager
spicyness
a
little
too
fizzy
which
pushes
back
the
taste
could
use
more
malt
backbone
but
then
it
probably
wouldnt
be
a
light
beer
far
superior
to
any
of
the
major
light
beers
and
better
than
my
memory
of
other
micro
lights
harpoon
mr
mikes
new
amsterdam
i
dont
really
remember
lightship
so
i
cant
compare
them
and
better
than
a
lot
of
sam
knockoffs
over
the
years
one
ugly
label
though
finally
got
to
try
sam
adams
light
here
in
chicago
at
a
local
bar
not
in
stores
just
yet
and
while
admittedly
it
was
better
than
your
average
light
beer
actually
better
than
95
of
the
light
beers
it
has
good
flavor
and
body
for
a
light
beer
the
only
light
beer
i
would
rank
higher
would
be
leinenkugels
amber
light
much
better
than
your
average
light
beer
i
like
the
fact
that
it
does
not
taste
like
sam
adams
lager
or
boston
ale
really
sweet
i
was
up
all
night
after
drinking
it
the
best
light
beer
out
there
pours
to
a
very
sammy
lager
looking
copper
color
light
taste
of
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
hop
finish
unlike
other
lights
you
can
actually
taste
some
malt
and
hops
as
another
reveiwer
said
no
much
in
terms
of
body
but
if
you
are
drinking
a
light
beer
you
arent
looking
for
body
ive
been
told
national
rollout
of
this
will
be
in
august
better
than
amstel
or
the
lights
from
the
imports
as
a
beer
its
a
good
beer
as
a
light
beer
it
is
great
not
deserving
of
the
sam
adams
label
the
only
thing
really
poor
was
the
way
it
felt
in
my
mouth
it
almost
felt
soapy
odd
for
a
light
beer
though
it
was
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
this
basically
tastes
like
sas
boston
lager
with
water
added
substantial
malt
character
and
pleasant
aroma
better
than
other
light
beers
but
tough
to
recommend
on
its
own
terms
will
drink
again
if
offered
might
be
nice
at
a
summer
bbq
would
work
as
a
compromise
brew
with
someone
whod
pick
something
like
amstel
if
left
to
herhis
own
devices
for
a
light
its
drinkable
and
is
much
better
than
a
bud
light
deep
coppery
color
with
some
carbonation
still
the
best
of
the
lights
is
alexander
keiths
light
ale
my
first
taste
of
this
light
was
disapointing
as
this
brew
warmed
in
my
glass
the
flavors
came
out
and
i
was
quite
impressed
this
is
what
a
light
beer
should
taste
like
just
the
copper
color
of
this
light
beer
is
enough
to
try
it
this
isnt
your
nascar
swilling
light
a
definite
brew
for
that
summer
bbq
or
tailgate
this
surprised
me
i
hate
light
beers
or
is
it
lite
this
has
a
wonderful
flavor
and
mouth
feel
for
a
light
beer
this
could
be
a
great
lawnmower
beer
for
next
summer
one
of
the
darkest
light
beers
i
have
ever
seen
one
of
the
maltiest
light
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
also
its
light
in
body
sure
but
crisp
and
decently
clean
considering
it
bites
even
going
almost
bubbly
but
it
isnt
all
that
far
off
from
smooth
this
is
the
only
light
beer
ive
had
that
i
couldnt
tell
was
light
all
but
impossible
to
find
in
seattle
oh
how
i
wish
it
werent
so
if
it
were
in
every
corner
store
id
be
drinking
a
pack
every
other
night
good
job
dixie
the
dixie
jazz
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
it
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
leaving
a
lacing
i
am
not
sure
why
they
call
this
an
light
amber
when
it
is
yellow
in
color
the
scent
is
more
malty
the
taste
is
evenly
balanced
nothing
spectacular
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
ok
o
tastes
more
like
a
aal
than
a
light
lager
which
is
can
be
read
as
a
positive
in
my
opinion
since
the
majority
of
light
lagers
have
minimal
amounts
of
taste
and
a
watery
body
not
overly
interesting
but
i
was
not
really
expecting
that
for
the
style
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
and
it
light
be
good
for
a
summer
outdoor
event
rjt
erp
i
dont
know
what
this
particular
offering
was
like
when
originally
brewed
in
cajun
country
but
i
cant
imagine
that
it
would
have
been
worse
than
this
dreck
a
sugary
mess
one
for
which
i
lack
the
cajones
to
recommend
to
annnyone
overall
refreshing
beer
seek
it
out
today
if
i
was
focused
on
finding
a
good
light
beer
i
would
commit
to
a
six
pack
one
more
surprising
note
this
beer
actually
improves
as
it
gets
warmer
this
is
not
normally
the
m
o
for
a
macro
style
beer
which
normally
improves
with
being
cold
but
thats
how
i
see
it
the
body
was
thin
as
it
should
be
for
the
style
but
i
dinged
it
a
bit
for
having
a
sticky
finish
that
was
mildly
unpleasant
drinkability
was
kind
of
blandly
meh
overall
this
would
probably
make
an
ok
lawnmower
beer
but
thats
about
it
even
at
that
you
could
make
a
better
choice
o
this
beer
isnt
bad
for
the
style
and
has
some
body
from
the
malts
but
the
taste
isnt
very
interesting
especially
with
the
flavors
of
corn
adjuncts
o
this
is
what
happens
when
ticking
goes
bad
i
finished
the
bottle
only
because
i
paid
bar
prices
for
it
otherwise
it
wouldve
been
a
drain
pour
its
horrible
do
yourself
a
favor
and
stay
away
from
this
beer
by
no
means
are
these
flavors
bold
and
heartyat
92
calories
a
bottle
theres
no
way
this
brew
could
keep
up
with
the
massive
sugardriven
fares
of
say
imperialsbut
they
are
wellbalanced
and
nicely
nuanced
budweiser
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
beers
like
this
the
flavor
is
sweet
but
is
mainly
bean
like
the
body
is
a
redamber
color
the
aroma
is
sweet
but
reminds
me
of
grass
the
head
poured
tan
at
about
a
finger
and
a
half
that
goes
away
fast
other
than
the
bean
flavor
it
is
a
very
mild
flavored
beer
the
body
is
thin
and
fizzy
overall
this
is
only
a
step
up
from
the
mass
produced
light
beer
i
would
like
to
see
what
this
brewery
could
do
with
a
true
amber
or
lager
pours
a
very
pale
amber
color
with
a
quickly
diminishing
head
the
scent
already
eludes
that
the
taste
is
going
to
be
that
of
a
cheap
beer
there
is
at
least
some
flavor
of
so
wheat
and
malts
but
it
is
very
comparable
to
that
of
miller
lite
or
bud
light
drinks
rather
fast
with
no
real
texture
or
volume
to
the
beer
this
is
one
you
can
skip
d
just
an
average
beer
its
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
is
going
on
overall
its
nothing
special
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
the
lightness
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
it
does
have
more
flavor
than
other
beers
of
its
ilk
the
beer
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
buttery
popcorn
the
flavor
is
very
thin
with
some
corn
honey
and
butter
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
there
is
not
much
going
on
in
this
beer
this
is
one
to
avoid
d
not
saying
that
i
would
never
drink
one
again
but
i
wont
go
seek
this
one
out
pours
a
copperish
color
with
a
small
white
bubbly
head
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt

a
little
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
of
caramel

and
a
small
hint
of
bananas
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
crisp
the
drinkability
is
good
you
could
have
it
as
a
session
beer
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
this
beer
but
nothing
to
completely
keep
you
interested
drinkability
i
have
graded
for
the
style
and
as
a
american
adjunct
lager
i
would
take
this
over
most
it
is
nice
and
light
and
sweet
and
has
good
flavoring
i
could
have
six
a
very
decent
beer
outside
of
the
style
i
think
this
is
a
b
d
this
is
an
okay
amber
lager
ive
certainly
had
better
d
this
is
an

ive

its
an
easy
to

because
it
isnt
offensive
unless
youre
easily
offended
by
a
superbly
plain
beer
watery
flavor
and
a
passive
aroma
just
add
to

you
could
find
better

red
with
more
red
than

hue
showing
through
smell
is
biscuit
malt
with
a
bread
aroma
the
taste
is
at
first
dull
and
then
your
tongue
is
met
with
a
biscuit

are
no
detectable
hops
or
other
spices
the
mouthfeel

thin

watery

upper

level
of
carbonation

it
is
only
4
13
abv
and
a
lighter
beer
it
could
be
very
sessionable
however
i
would
look
elsewhere
due
to
the
lack
of
taste
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
kind
of
different
representation
of
style
its
listed
as
an
amber
light
beer
on
the
label
and
while
its
not
like
a
typical
fizzy
yellow
light
beer
its
still
not
very
good
light
bodied
reasonably
smooth
drinkable
ice
cold
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
a
semilight
mainstream
lager
drinkability
i
believe
it
was
louis
armstrong
that
once
said
if
you
have
to
ask
what
an
instantly
forgettable
bland
light
lager
is
youll
never
know
something
like
that
i
cant
finish
this
one
and
feel
like
i
need
to
brush
my
teeth
pass
on
this
one
stillnot
six
pack
worthy
for
me
yet
if
one
has
a
bbq
with
the
friends
and
family
then
its
a
decent
beer
to
have
around
d
i
got
about
a
third
of
the
way
through
the
bottle
before
i
gave
up
the
taste
was
just
too
bad
for
me
to
keep
drinking
perhaps
if
it
was
really
cold
i
could
have
half
a
bottle
overall
for
a
lite
beer
i
have
to
admit
it
was
not
terrible
i
could
do
this
one
again
in
a
pinch
one
finger
of
white
foam
on
top
of
a
clear
light
amber
body
carbonation
is
pretty
good
very
light
smell
and
taste
no
corn
adjunct
flavors
decent
malt
presence
little
bit
of
bitterness
but
no
real
hop
flavor
overall
a
decent
craft
version
of
a
predominately
macro
style
pass
on
this
one
drinkability
this
beer
would
be
best
cold
as
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
otherwise
not
much
for
drinkability
for
this
one
d
a
beer
that
now
that
i
have
had
it
i
can
say
i
dont
want
to
have
it
ever
again
a
lawnmower
beer
sure
but
there
are
beeter
ones
out
there
that
also
would
do
that
job
but
with
some
flavor
tastes
pretty
oxidized
but
still
drinkable
it
most
definitely
tastes
better
than
the
dixie
lager
this
is
a
pretty
mild
mannered
beer
that
might
be
halfway
decent
if
it
wasnt
like
biting
into
some
cardboard
carbonation
is
high
and
there
is
a
little
bit
of
detectable
hop
bitterness
fairly
forgettable
beer
but
at
96
calories
i
would
give
this
a
leg
up
on
michalob
ultra
and
the
like
this
beer
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
pillowy
white
head
that
receded
rapidly
decent
lacing
nose
is
very
grainy
with
notes
of
corn
and
pale
malts
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
bready
and
grainy
the
sweetness
in
the
nose
filters
to
the
taste
as
well
but
not
well
balanced
it
sort
of
sneaks
up
on
you
mouthfeel
is
pretty
carbonated
light
and
on
the
watery
side
the
beer
goes
down
easily
but
not
balanced
well
it
was
fun
to
try
but
not
one
that
i
will
pick
up
again
this
is
a
light
amber
brew
i
dont
think
ive
ever
actually
had
one
before
i
do
like
the
beer
but
theres
something
holding
it
back
i
will
recommend
it
to
others
just
because
of
the
style
well
what
can
i
say
it
has
more
flavor
than
bmc
but
it
is
lacking
in
other
areas
as
well
for
a
light
beer
at
92
calories
i
suppose
its
pretty
tasty
i
must
admit
that
this
one
aint
good
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
failed
miserably
d
although
this
isnt
an
exceptionally
flavorful
beer
it
does
go
down
easy
would
make
a
good
session
beer
for
a
hot
crayfish
day
d
shitty
beer
really
the
new
labels
are
definitely
an
improvement
on
the
old
labels
seen
above
its
too
bad
that
dixie
beer
is
still
being
brewed
in
minnesota
it
will
be
nice
when
the
brewery
is
able
to
resume
full
operations
down
in
the
crescent
city
where
they
belong
bottom
line
a
great
name
but
an
average
to
slightly
belowaverage
beer
the
feel
is
a
bit
watery
but
thats
kind
of
appropriate
for
style
pleasant
enough
an
okay
barley
lager
not
amber
at
all
though
12oz
twistoff
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
light
orangish
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
bready
malt
and
a
hint
of
caramel
there
is
not
much
flavor
going
on
in
the
taste
but
it
certainly
is
a
thirst
quencher
that
could
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
highly
carbonated
very
reminiscent
of
your
typical
macro
lager
overall
dixie
jazz
is
what
it
is
a
pretty
flavorless
lager
that
does
not
offend
the
masses
but
will
not
satisfy
most
beer
geeks
nothing
special
at
all
been
saving
blackened
voodoo
for
last
hope
that
was
wise
dixie
jazz
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
very
mild
malt
aroma
there
is
kind
of
a
grainy
flavor
nothing
especially
interesting
going
on
with
this
one
kind
of
a
dull
bitter
aftertaste
that
isnt
particularly
pleasant
skicks
around
id
pass
there
was
a
fairly
decent
creamy
feel
to
it
at
least
but
overall
this
beer
needs
more
of
everything
verdict
starts
out
ok
but
then
goes
downhill
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
would
give
it
points
for
not
being
a
typical
light
lager
but
its
not
enough
to
pull
it
up
d
overall
a
very
sweet
fruity
beer
with
some
citrus
and
lots
of
carbonatation
a
tweener
or
micro
with
training
wheels
overall
not
so
good
reminds
me
of
a
low
carb
beer
id
say
pass
on
this
one
pours
a
slightly
fogged
orange
amber
a
crème
head
forms
and
falls
nose
seems
not
that
clean
flavor
matches
with
a
not
so
smooth
ride
just
seems
to
lack
balance
or
a
smooth
flavor
feel
is
nice
but
who
cares
this
is
one
that
you
wouldnt
miss
much
if
you
passed
on
it
rather
like
carbonated
water
there
is
hardly
any
beer
going
on
here
only
92
calories
whatever
they
might
as
well
add
and
hardly
any
flavor
they
need
to
jazz
it
up
a
bit
drinks
a
bit
slow
too
much
cornyness
very
run
of
the
mill
if
you
find
it
cheap
during
summer
you
may
like
this
better
than
i
did
overall
impression
this
is
a
very
mediocre
beer
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
ill
be
drinking
the
rest
of
this
six
pack
out
of
the
bottle
and
not
thinking
about
it
too
much
pours
out
to
a
darker
orange
amber
color
with
a
dr
pepper
head
of
foam
that
dissipated
very
quickly
aromas
of
malts
and
sweet
corn
and
gran
not
bad
taste
is
bland
and
unexciting
but
really
expectations
shouldnt
be
all
that
high
malt
grain
slight
spice
a
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
like
water
drinkability
is
nearly
nonexistant
very
boring
moderate
to
light
body
not
worth
drinking
again
maybe
a
good
one
for
bud
light
fans
in
fact
i
know
who
i
can
unload
the
other
five
bottles
to
now
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
weak
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
malts
adjuncts
and
light
crystal
malts
it
has
a
sweet
aroma
with
a
musty
character
not
very
appealing
the
taste
is
awful
it
is
like
drinking
a
glass
of
water
with
half
a
killians
dumped
into
it
it
has
little
beer
flavor
it
goes
down
like
water
and
finishes
dry
and
metallic
the
mouthfeel
is
terrible
it
is
an
extremely
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
was
made
for
easy
drinking
the
problem
is
its
too
weak
to
be
enjoyable
it
doesnt
even
taste
like
beer

feel
im

sure
whats
jazzy
about
this
brew
they
should
of
named
it

surge
it
would
of
fit
better
i
would
not
recommend
even
trying
this
one
stay
away
comments
not
too
good
i
liked
the
appearance

nice
color
and
the
head
lasted
for
the
entire
beer
smell
was
horrid
taste
wasnt
too
bad
once
the
metallic
taste
went
away
yet
another
lesson
from
schoolteacher
and
biruchan
hmmmwhere
did
they
come
up
with
their
lesson
plan
this
was
a
much
prettier
beer
than
i
expected
it
to
be
copperamber
colored
with
a
medium
head
that
disappeared
fast
it
also
blew
the
regular
dixie
beer
to
hell
man
that
stuff
was
horrid
on
to
the
negatives
it
was
not
as
good
as
the
crimson
or
blackened
voodoo
while
more
flavorful
and
fuller
bodied
than
most
light
beers
it
was
still
a
light
beer
and
you
can
only
squeeze
so
much
out
of
that
faint
malt
flavor
and
aroma
was
about
all
it
had
going
for
it
after
drinking
beer
for
over
40
years
this
is
my
go
to
this
beer
bring
back
memories
this
was
our
go
to
at
the
ski
lodge
when
my
college
buddies
and
i
went
snowboarding
3
dollars
for
a
pounder
not
a
bad
brew
refreshing
clean
and
somewhat
tasty
overall
well
this
is
off
my
list
of
beers
to
try
at
least
i
get
the
beer
credit
for
drinking
one
i
will
not
drink
this
again
can
you
make
a
worse
beer
i
doubt
it
take
the
worst
of
the
macros
water
it
down
and
make
it
more
unappealing
thats
ic
light
i
c
light
brewed
by
pittsburgh
brewing
co
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
4
15
the
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
i
c
light
is
a
filtered
brew
you
can
see
right
though
it
this
brew
looks
like
most
american
light
brews
the
smell
has
some
grains
and
malts
you
do
pick
up
on
some
corn
in
this
brew
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
so
far
now
for
the
taste
the
taste
at
first
is
bitter
but
it
goes
down
smooth
but
there
is
something
in
there
at
first
this
brew
ok
it
is
not
bad
but
it
is
not
good
i
would
put
this
light
brew
right
in
the
middle
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
with
a
clean
finish
but
the
first
taste
is
bitter
sweet
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
out
5

the

but
not
the

otherwise
i
wouldnt
drink
this
unless
visiting
pittsburgh
where
the
locals
embrace
its
quirks
and
flaws
o
this
isnt
terrible
i
actually
prefer
it
over
bmc
light
beers
actually
has
a
bit
of
flavor
but
not
much
o
this
is
a
really
good
light
lager
it
was
93
cents
for
a
12oz
bottle
if
i
could
find
this
in
a
case
locally
it
would
probably
be
my
go
to
cheap
beer
the
flavor
is
not
bad
yet
it
does
lack
any
real
resemblance
to
beer
since
you
basically
get
the
fizziness
yet
a
light
sweetness
is
present
on
the
palate
with
very
light
fruity
tinge
the
overall
impression
is
nothing
special
to
enjoy
or
appreciate
even
in
the
realm
of
light
beers
it
is
basically
a
palate
cleanser
would
pair
well
with
extremely
spicy
wings
or
greasy
fairfood
maybe
o
no
thanks
ill
pass
next
time
o
there
is
a
minimal
amount
of
flavor
to
this
beer
but
it
is
not
offensive
feels
like
it
is
a
good
beer
for
hydrating
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
while
working
in
the
yard
the
beer
you
reach
for
when
iron
city
is
just
to
heavy
and
calorieladen
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
funky
wheat
and
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
hard
water
and
funky
wheat
really
combining
for
some
fun
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
meek
characterless
beer
prolly
exactly
what
they
were
aiming
for
some
people
much
better
than
bud
or
coors
light
like
miller
but
would
buy
instead
since
it
is
a
smaller
brewer
alright
light
beer
overall
more
flavorful
the
average
light
beer
with
a
better
look
as
well
if
you
want
a
light
beer
this
is
one
to
have
from
time
to
time
pale
beer
with
a
thin
soapy
head
that
fades
over
30
seconds
or
so
faint
grassy
aroma
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
dry
grass
flavor
and
not
much
else
has
a
bit
of
a
sugary
aftertaste
ic
light
isnt
offensive
to
the
palate
but
it
doesnt
offer
much
either
still
i
think
it
tastes
better
than
some
of
the
more
popular
light
lagers
id
drink
it
again
if
it
were
offered
to
me
but
its
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
is
my
first
ic
light
since
leaving
pa
in
07
i
can
see
why
i
drank
so
many
of
them
back
in
the
day
its
cheap
sessionable
and
unoffensive
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
good
summer
beer
for
backyard
activities
o
i
purchased
a
6
pack
for
4
50
not
a
bad
deal
a
good
light
lager
especilly
for
that
price
i
would
definitely
take
this
over
any
bmc
macro
produced
light
lagers
its
sunday
evening
and
i
need
a
bottle
of
healing
after
my
hockey
game
had
an
iron
city
lite
in
the
fridge
so
why
not
this
beer
is
a
typical
light
beer
decent
flavor
the
color
is
golden
clear
with
thin
white
head
and
has
a
modest
lace
there
is
only
a
weak
grain
nose
the
taste
is
typical
of
this
beer
style
mouthfeel
is
decent
perfect
for
any
lawn
mowing
issues
session
easily
but
would
prefer
others
no
question
poured
this
onto
a
glass
and
was
assuming
itd
look
like
a
light
lager
it
has
very
little
to
offer
the
consumer
this
beer
goes
down
fairly
quickly
at
least
as
it
warms
it
kind
of
starts
to
have
an
odd
aroma
drink
these
fast
if
you
have
too
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
miller
lite
nothing
special
here
pretty
plain
and
nothing
beyond
ordinary
dthis
is
one
of
the
better
light
beers
ive
had
but
its
still
not
a
great
or
good
or
decent
beer
id
rather
see
this
in
kegs
at
parties
than
bmc
products
tho
this
was
probably
one
of
the
better
macros
out
there
not
something
i
would
buy
though
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
always
counter
that
factorwhich
is
evidently
so
important
to
the
average
beer
drinkerwith
what
is
in
my
opinion
more
important
whether
or
not
i
actually
want
to
drink
it
notes
all
in
all
if
you
are
looking
for
a
low
cal
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
give
this
a
try
it
is
every
bit
as
good
as
its
bmc
counter
parts
and
it
is
independent
eh
its
a
light
beer
what
else
can
i
say
im
not
a
fan
of
light
beers
but
im
always
searching
albeit
fruitlessly
for
a
light
beer
other
than
sam
light
that
i
can
tolerate
there
just
aint
no
thing
but
if
youre
getting
sick
of
bmc
light
beers
try
this
i
didnt
like
this
beer
at
all
and
while
it
may
be
drinkable
i
dont
jnow
why
anyone
would
want
to
d
easy
to
drink
good
for
parties
an
aggressive
pour
produced
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
nose
was
very
light
and
slightly
sweet
the
color
was
a
pale
strawyellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
with
a
mild
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
equally
thin
with
that
same
sweetness
that
just
seemed
to
linger
overall
it
was
a
pretty
boring
beer
oh
well
stick
to
arn
overall
another
crappy
light
american
lager
yawn
im
glad
my
buddy
thought
of
me
and
brought
this
home
im
just
sad
he
didnt
grab
mesomething
good
it
poured
a
light
yellow
with
no
lace
and
first
impression
was
water
but
the
bubbles
make
it
ginger
ale
not
much
scent
a
little
musty
macro
cheap
beer
scent
smells
like
any
other
mouth
was
thin
with
a
corn
grain
aftertaste
but
nothing
like
a
cheap
macro
actually
just
a
slight
hop
bite
too
taste
well
thin
and
any
light
but
the
difference
is
this
one
is
pretty
clean
corn
husk
is
light
enough
minor
alcohol
in
the
middle
and
slightly
bitter
hops
hmmm
yes
this
is
better
than
before
as
it
no
longer
has
the
slight
skunk
of
old
id
say
this
is
much
better
than
almost
all
the
macro
lights
ive
had
just
enough
to
be
more
than
water
a
lot
less
skunk
than
other
light
beers
id
say
when
i
want
a
light
id
get
this
overall
a
decent
light
adjunct
lager
good
local
alternative
drinkability
is
decent
for
a
light
lager
this
is
mediocre
at
best
but
still
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
may
be
bias
being
from
pittsburgh
but
i
think
this
beer
is
better
than
the
bmcs
not
a
good
beer
but
a
beer
that
i
can
live
with
for
tailgating
and
the
like
the
drink
is
lightbodied
and
an
easy
drinker
when
served
at
nearfreezing
and
virtuallyflavorless
but
at
cellar
temperature
or
any
warmer
ic
light
is
pretty
much
pisswater
awful
d
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
lite
beers
that
being
said
this
one
had
more
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
lite
beer
tasty
nicely
balanced
goes
down
easily
and
not
very
filling
at
all
check
this
one
out
nice
bottle
good
revamped
label
design
i
had
a
feeling
this
one
was
going
to
pour
a
clear
yellow
and
alas
it
did
with
a
small
white
head
decent
nose
i
must
say
a
bit
fruity
light
but
nothing
foul
at
all
damn
fresh
and
pretty
inviting
clean
flavor
of
an
american
macro
decent
balance
is
achieved
light
in
body
very
very
drinkable
not
bad
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
great
for
pregaming
or
for
that
matter
during
the
game
whatever
sport
you
enjoy
drinkability
if
i
drink
light
beer
at
a
barbeque
or
someones
having
a
party
with
such
a
brew
its
not
too
bad
id
never
really
buy
it
myself
but
there
are
worse
light
beers
out
there
very
easy
to
drink
and
wash
food
down
and
its
nice
they
actually
have
the
calories
and
nutritional
information
on
the
can
too
since
many
light
beers
dont
i
dont
think
this
can
gave
i
c
light
its
best
showing
ive
had
it
on
tap
around
pittsburg
tasting
much
better
than
this
dated
can
did
tonight
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
drank
about
10
watching
the
super
bowl
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
out
and
buy
another
case
any
time
soon
decent
for
a
light
beer
but
nothing
more
ill
be
honest
there
is
not
much
to
write
about
when
it
comes
to
this
beer
it
was
amazingly
plain
it
had
a
rough
white
head
over
very
pale
transparent
body
the
aroma
was
very
weak
but
smelled
of
malt
and
was
little
bit
crisp
i
noticed
the
mouthfeel
before
i
notice
the
flavor
it
was
very
watery
and
thin
with
some
carbonation
to
it
and
that
was
about
it
the
flavor
was
beany
and
grassy
but
not
bitter
at
all
overall
it
was
beer
flavored
water
i
will
say
it
was
refreshing
at
the
time
because
i
was
parched
this
is
a
below
average
beer
that
is
consistent
for
style
the
beer
was
very
light
colored
almost
clear
the
head
did
not
last
very
long
at
all
i
was
pretty
sure
this
beer
would
suck
anyway
since
im
not
much
on
light
beer
i
will
have
to
say
though
it
was
pretty
darn
good
a
great
summertime
refresher
brew
the
taste
was
clean
and
fresh
i
would
certainly
buy
this
beer
again
i
expected
to
be
disgusted
by
some
dms
cooked
vegetable
aroma
and
flavorriden
mess
but
this
was
a
decent
macro
light
beer
all
things
considered
yeah
it
was
pretty
watery
but
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
unpleasantly
dry
bitter
or
astringent
light
most
other
light
beers
instead
this
matched
a
slight
lemon
flavor
with
mild
bready
malts
not
a
lot
going
on
but
its
a
light
beer
what
more
do
you
pours
a
near
flat
very
light
straw
color
it
has
almost
no
scent
at
all
beyond
a
very
mild
sweet
sugary
aroma
almost
no
taste
it
was
nearly
like
drinking
water
it
was
very
smooth
though
i
have
to
give
it
that
while
not
a
great
beer
this
would
be
great
after
working
outside
during
the
summer
drinkability
a
fairly
empty
beer
experience
though
surprisingly
it
was
a
bit
more
tolerable
than
the
standard
iron
city
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
its
very
similar
to
your
typical
fizzy
yellow
beer
but
this
one
at
least
has
a
little
bit
more
flavor
d
i
recommend
for
steeler
tailgate
parties
in
the
dead
of
winter
or
in
the
summer
for
the
pirates
i
am
not
too
much
into
light
beers
but
i
thoguht
i
would
try
it
for
the
sake
of
doing
just
like
any
other
bland
light
beer
pours
a
sloppy
yellow
with
minimal
head
taste
like
regular
iron
city
with
water
added
and
flavor
subtracted
drink
at
a
bbq
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
an
all
day
session
beer
for
penguins
pirates
or
steelers
games
it
is
what
it
is
and
i
love
it
for
that
light
mouthfeelnot
watery
like
a
lot
of
light
macros
has
a
grainyness
tastes
like
beer
even
has
a
bite
to
it
my
choice
for
sessioning
a
light
macro
blows
away
bmc
lite
beers
rated
this
beer
compaired
to
other
light
beers
out
there
cant
belive
more
people
dont
drink
this
one
somewhat
refreshing
got
a
single
bottle
for
50
cents
so
my
money
wasnt
completely
wasted
ok
i
must
admit
i
am
pushing
a
local
beer
but
listen
up
yall
this
beer
is
noted
for
starting
the
whole
light
beer
trend
it
was
out
way
before
low
carb
diets
were
the
rage
it
has
a
full
flavor
taste
but
yet
is
low
in
calories
and
carbs
and
contains
just
about
the
normal
abv
as
a
regular
beer
it
is
very
smooth
going
down
finishes
clean
and
tastes
great
with
wings
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
when
i
am
parked
in
front
of
the
tv
watching
my
fave
team
play
some
footballand
im
sure
you
can
guess
who
it
is
if
you
looked
to
see
where
the
beer
is
made
and
thank
you
for
keeping
it
local
try
it
peoples
i
c
light
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
aroma
is
mostly
adjunct
light
body
highly
carbonated
minimal
taste
the
taste
is
heavy
on
adjunct
typical
for
the
style
i
guess
no
real
off
tastes
not
bad
compared
to
the
competitors
this
isnt
that
great
but
its
very
drinkable
and
its
tradition
i
was
very
upset
when
the
miller
lite
guy
came
to
my
section
but
the
iron
city
guy
didnt
i
had
to
get
up
to
go
buy
this
one
oddly
enougha
bottle
of
dfh
60
min
ipa
is
5
75
and
a
bottle
of
bmc
or
iron
city
is
6
so
if
you
are
ever
at
a
pirates
game
hit
up
the
beers
of
the
burgh
stand
0
7
grams
protein
i
c
light
is
the
clear
winner
of
macro
smackdown
xii
simply
put
its
a
drinkable
light
lager
that
i
was
able
to
get
some
enjoyment
out
of
in
contradistinction
to
lone
star
light
which
isnt
and
which
i
wasnt
pittsburghs
favorite
light
lager
is
one
of
the
best
beers
of
that
style
that
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
this
was
from
a
12
ounce
aluminum
bottle
ic
light
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
small
white
head
which
goes
away
quick
it
smells
like
grain
corn
and
some
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
mostly
malty
and
grainy
with
a
small
metallic
taste
too
it
starts
off
a
bit
sweet
and
finishes
a
bit
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
with
that
being
said
the
drinkability
is
decent
as
the
beer
is
nonoffensive
and
it
does
go
down
smooth
yeah
there
are
plenty
of
better
choices
out
there
but
its
not
bad
on
a
hot
summer
day
watching
a
ball
game
at
pnc
park
d
meh
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
head
little
aroma
maybe
a
slight
floral
scent
very
mild
watereddown
taste
but
goes
down
pretty
well
no
pungent
aftertaste
or
anything
its
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
this
is
my
pick
for
cheapest
case
if
i
need
something
in
a
pinch
to
please
people
it
makes
a
good
footballparty
beer
if
youre
watching
the
game
with
a
large
group
of
beer
guzzlers
especially
steelers
fans
maybe
it
was
the
firstbeeroftheday
syndrome
the
first
beer
you
have
that
day
never
tastes
bad
but
i
really
didnt
think
this
was
a
bad
brew
at
all
what
i
really
liked
was
that
ic
light
didnt
seem
to
have
that
typical
overcarbonated
burningmouth
sensation
that
a
lot
of
other
lights
have
it
also
has
that
interesting
grasshayetc
taste
that
all
light
beers
have
like
you
are
chewing
on
a
mouthful
of
something
that
has
been
freshly
cut
from
the
ground
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
not
bad
at
all
iclight
is
the
babyfood
version
of
iron
city
it
tastes
like
rusty
rinse
if
youre
not
a
true
beer
drinker
and
just
like
some
cold
watery
beverage
without
a
sweet
taste
then
this
is
your
beer
actually
it
has
less
nasties
to
it
than
the
original
standard
iron
city
and
in
that
regard
it
is
better
than
at
least
one
beer
in
the
world
dont
ever
try
it
if
you
want
to
try
a
pittsburgh
macro
i
recommend
standard
iron
city
over
this
this
is
your
classic
cheap
beer
made
for
the
weekend
warrior
not
much
more
to
this
beer
than
a
glass
of
water
but
like
coors
light
anyone
can
choke
this
stuff
down
it
has
very
little
colore
ui
also
has
very
little
taste
it
did
not
stimulate
my
palate
much
at
all
it
had
little
head
when
poured
and
quickly
lost
any
trace
of
that
the
smell
has
an
interesting
fruity
quality
thats
almost
like
sour
apple
highly
carbonated
with
a
taste
that
starts
out
fairly
plain
like
a
stereotypical
light
beer
then
finishes
with
a
somewhat
citruslike
aftertaste
the
unique
finish
gives
it
more
character
than
some
light
beers
ive
tried
but
nothing
special
its
fine
for
beer
pong
or
if
youre
just
looking
for
a
cold
one
but
if
you
really
want
something
satisfying
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
slightly
dark
straw
color
with
a
small
thin
white
head
aroma
of
cooked
corn
and
some
citrus
fruits
taste
was
sweeter
at
first
with
a
touch
of
grassy
adjunct
but
it
wasnt
too
strong
watery
middle
and
the
finish
had
a
cranberry
like
tartness
to
it
very
dry
at
the
end
this
was
watery
but
what
do
you
expect
and
the
adjuncts
were
not
too
strong
still
i
just
didnt
really
care
for
it
too
much
decent
for
what
it
is
very
light
yellow
and
a
small
white
head
that
fell
to
a
stubborn
ring
lots
of
active
carbonation
even
after
a
few
minutes
not
bad
looking
at
all
for
a
light
lager
smell
was
nondescript
consisting
a
watery
corn
harsh
odors
that
must
be
hops
and
a
saccharine
hit
taste
is
rather
malty
for
the
style
or
has
a
sweetener
been
added
watery
mouthfeel
an
abrupt
finish
though
it
does
dry
out
a
bit
really
nothing
terrible
but
not
particularly
memorable
either
if
someone
has
it
at
a
football
party
pop
a
can
it
wont
hurt
you
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
below
average
it
has
a
very
faint
pale
malt
scent
with
loads
of
adjuncts
and
a
dry
musty
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
terrible
it
has
very
watery
pale
malt
flavor
with
lots
of
adjuncts
present
it
has
no
hop
character
its
almost
like
drinking
seltzer
water
with
a
slight
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
below
average
light
lager
it
has
little
flavor
and
almost
no
malt
aroma
its
one
and
done
for
me
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
aluminum
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
soft
mouthfeel
and
definitely
light
midlevel
carbonation
dry
finish
the
drinkability
is
ok
and
i
would
prefer
this
over
ic
if
forced
to
choose
drinkability
i
was
rather
surprised
by
this
beer
picked
up
a
couple
of
these
following
the
dontknockittilyoutryit
rule
glad
i
tried
it
because
it
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
there
was
something
kind
of
good
about
this
beer
and
something
kind
of
wrong
definitely
more
character
than
most
light
beers
so
thats
a
plus
but
nothing
at
all
great
doubt
ill
buy
one
of
these
again
unless
its
the
only
alternative
to
one
of
the
bmc
usual
suspects
then
id
definitely
grab
an
arn
just
a
note
abv
is
4
15
according
to
pittsburgs
web
site
there
are
worse
choices
you
could
make
just
dont
pick
this
one
when
you
want
to
enjoy
a
good
beer
you
know
what
this
aint
a
bad
beer
poured
out
to
a
decent
and
average
golden
color
with
a
small
head
medium
carbonation
odors
of
corn
and
sweet
alcohol
not
bad
for
a
cheap
beer
flavor
is
acceptable
not
offensive
but
not
great
either
just
needs
more
character
finished
very
smooth
and
crisp
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
one
well
made
macro
imo
recommended
well
this
one
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
minimal
head
the
smell
was
of
faint
malt
and
some
sweetness
the
taste
was
light
go
figure
and
had
hints
of
malt
corn
and
rice
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
overly
carbonated
as
for
dinkability
i
developed
a
huge
headache
after
drinking
just
one
of
these
maybe
someone
is
trying
to
tell
me
something
but
if
you
like
light
beers
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
onefingered
bubbly
white
head
that
goes
very
quickly
and
leaves
some
lace
clear
pale
yellow
color
light
carbonation
and
very
light
bodied
nose
is
hoppy
with
adjuncts
starts
with
a
sweet
citrus
flavor
watery
finish
is
boring
but
this
has
more
flavor
than
a
bud
light
the
abv
is
4
15
79
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
liquor
barn
lexington
ky
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
heavy
mouthfeel
for
a
light
lager
but
easily
quaffable
not
a
bad
might
actually
be
a
good
thirstquencher
on
a
fishing
trip
like
most
macro
types
this
ones
basically
like
iron
city
but
watered
down
alot
thus
its
better
than
most
other
macro
lights
as
iron
city
is
better
than
most
macros
this
one
pours
a
light
golden
colour
with
lots
of
carbonated
fizz
and
virtually
no
smell
or
flavour
pretty
standard
stuff
a
bit
fuller
than
other
light
beers
but
barely
if
youve
got
to
choose
from
amongst
this
stuff
stick
with
regular
old
iron
city
pours
golden
pale
straw
hue
with
a
white
short
lived
head
with
no
lacing
to
spare
for
my
enjoyment
aroma
slightly
sweet
cooked
veggie
adjunct
origin
with
a
mild
flowery
hop
aroma
taste
light
refreshing
sweetness
here
not
the
smoothest
beer
here
but
better
than
a
lot
of
other
mass
produced
light
lagers
out
there
in
my
opinion
a
little
partial
since
i
was
born
in
pittsburgh
only
complaint
is
the
slightly
metallic
tone
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
easy
going
lawnmower
beer
not
meant
to
think
about
and
breakdown
just
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
hard
to
beleieve
this
beer
has
been
replaced
by
the
silver
bullet
in
the
pittsburgh
market
truly
a
shame
that
advertising
means
more
than
taste
these
days
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
it
delivered
a
drinkable
beer
that
has
an
element
of
actual
enjoyment
and
refreshment
from
a
regional
american
light
lager
the
colour
is
a
mediumlight
golden
hue
and
the
head
of
cource
is
very
thin
carbonation
is
limited
and
the
body
is
very
weak
the
taste
is
acceptable
for
a
light
but
is
still
lacking
presence
just
a
basic
hohum
brew
that
belongs
in
someones
fridge
but
not
mine
maybe
it
is
because
i
lived
most
of
my
life
in
the
burgh
but
i
really
like
ic
light
sure
it
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
but
it
is
refreshing
and
a
good
mediator
beer
keeps
you
from
getting
totally
wasted
in
the
burgh
which
is
easy
to
do
because
beer
is
so
cheap
i
will
have
an
iron
anyday
of
the
week
i
always
said
light
beer
if
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
but
like
to
pee
a
lot
this
is
no
exception
this
beer
is
very
light
yellow
and
extremelly
clear
almost
no
noticeable
smell
taste
is
also
almost
non
existent
slight
taste
of
malt
and
cooked
rice
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
higly
carbonated
like
drinking
alkaseltzer
again
drink
cold
not
very
flavourful
lacks
anything
distinct
the
scent
is
faint
and
unappealing
the
taste
is
bland
settles
poorly
nothing
going
on
in
this
beer
overall
an
above
average
macro
light
lager
brew
is
what
it
is
a
light
lager
that
wouldnt
offend
poured
a
2
white
head
very
light
clear
straw
yellow
color
smells
like
grass
and
some
sort
of
mild
hops
very
mild
taste
of
corn
with
a
mild
acidic
zing
to
the
finish
although
thoroughly
mainstream
bmc
average
i
have
to
admit
this
wasnt
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
id
choose
it
over
many
of
the
other
weak
light
beers
out
there
pretty
much
what
i
expected
for
a
light
adjunct
lager
good
beer
for
parties
and
games
where
theres
nothing
better
being
offered
overall
not
much
of
a
difference
between
the
golden
and
the
light
save
the
gas
and
the
simplicity
of
its
taste
profile
drinkable
in
vast
quantities
but
preferably
in
pongassholeregattaflipcup
engagements
i
decided
to
try
a
calibration
beforehand
and
drank
a
regular
canadian
before
having
its
light
version
my
pour
created
a
fluffy
two
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
it
fizzled
and
bubbled
with
co2
but
ultimately
fell
harder
than
a
drunken
sod
in
the
dark
on
sunday
morning
the
color
was
a
lighter
paler
yellow
than
its
leaded
counterpart
nose
was
pretty
much
the
same
a
sweetish
cerealladen
lagerish
smell
that
i
have
grown
accustomed
to
boooring
mouthfeel
was
actually
fuller
more
effervescent
than
regular
but
the
taste
was
definitely
lessened
by
whatever
process
is
used
to
create
a
light
version
of
a
beer
this
was
almost
bland
and
watery
like
a
broken
pencil
pointless
ho
freakin
hum
the
finish
was
equally
snoozeworthy
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
slight
hints
of
corn
taste
is
crisp
basically
flavorless
not
really
getting
much
of
anything
here
feels
watery
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
due
to
its
lightness
overall
there
is
not
much
to
this
beer
at
all
d
good
better
than
most
light
lager
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
dec270907622nb
sampled
on
august
28
2009
since
i
am
trying
to
lose
weight
i
have
been
drinking
more
and
more
light
beers
and
this
one
is
actually
pretty
good
as
far
as
light
beers
go
the
pour
tends
to
be
more
golden
yellow
with
a
lot
of
foamy
white
head
and
excitable
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
barley
malts
and
a
little
grass
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
heavier
than
many
lights
and
in
the
medium
range
the
taste
is
has
a
nice
balance
of
malts
and
a
chaser
of
hops
but
not
overpowering
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
dry
with
a
light
crisp
feel
it
is
also
very
drinkable
a
very
pale
golden
color
body
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly

rather
lightsome

drinkerwith
little
to
no

bad
for
a
light
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
were
into
the
light
beer
thing
when
you
gotta
drink
a
light
macro
this
would
be
mine
of
choice
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
for
drinking
lots
of
very
quickly
a
good
drinking
game
beer
or
one
to
pound
while
watching
some
television
not
a
bad
light
beer
d
this
is
average
drinking
at
best
for
the
average
light
beer
drinker
this
would
work
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
flavorful
beers
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
extremely
light
in
the
mouth
the
consistency
of
carbonated
water
finish
is
dry
easy
to
quaff
and
if
youre
going
to
drink
this
youd
better
be
quaffing
it
theres
no
other
reason
to
drink
this
shit
beer
if
youre
not
drinking
this
to
get
wasted
because
im
sure
itll
only
take
about
1012
of
these
bad
boys
i
have
no
idea
what
is
going
on
with
that
fucked
up
brain
of
yours
if
someone
tells
me
that
this
is
their
favorite
beer
and
that
it
tastes
so
good
im
going
to
laugh
in
their
face
really
really
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
this
this
beer
isnt
worth
the
minuscule
amount
of
iron
in
my
shit
pale
yellow
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
nose
is
grainy
with
some
bitterness
the
flavor
has
a
little
corn
added
the
the
grains
light
overcarbonated
body
stings
my
tounge
i
suppose
a
canadian
some
where
may
enjoy
this
brew
d
this
is
what
i
keep
in
the
fridge
for
guests
who
arent
willing
to
try
something
different
i
grabbed
one
today
to
kick
off
superbowl
sunday
not
a
bad
selection
for
a
light
lager
at
all
and
it
went
well
in
my
dallas
cowboys
mug
figured
it
was
about
time
to
review
it
overall
not
a
bad
light
beer
but
ill
try
any
canadian
beer
the
great
white
north
makes
a
decent
beer
time
and
again
what
else
is
there
but
snow
beer
and
hockey
ha
pours
a
typical
light
yellow
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
aroma
is
pretty
bland
at
first
though
i
detect
hints
of
corn
adjunct
and
some
sweetness
taste
is
much
of
the
same
sweet
and
yet
some
bitterness
on
the
tongue
nothing
too
impressive
or
offensive
at
the
same
time
tastes
like
molson
canadian
except
lighter
of
course
i
would
give
it
a
fair
rating
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
filling
at
all
which
isnt
surprising
there
isnt
anything
about
this
beer
that
would
make
me
want
to
buy
it
if
i
were
going
for
an
inexpensive
light
beer
there
are
better
and
more
inexpensive
ones
available
molson
delivers
a
pretty
basic
light
lager
in
their
canadian
light
the
golden
body
is
a
little
bit
darker
than
most
which
is
nice
and
the
head
is
a
creamy
bright
white
but
it
dissipates
quickly
as
expected
the
nose
offers
a
bit
of
yeasty
fruitiness
and
some
sweet
malt
along
with
some
floral
hops
nice
in
the
mouth
it
offers
a
dextrinous
mediumlight
body
and
a
gently
zesty
carbonation
the
malt
is
just
slightly
grainy
and
it
leans
towards
sweetness
but
never
really
gets
there
its
surprisingly
rich
for
a
light
beer
and
actually
offers
more
flavor
than
some
of
the
standard
pricepoint
beers
out
there
the
balance
is
nice
and
the
transition
is
smooth
from
malt
into
lingering
floral
and
spicy
hops
amidst
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
hmmmm
actually
pretty
good
in
comparison
to
most
light
beers
well
done
macsmack
vii
is
a
classic
case
of
the
relative
merits
of
a
lack
of
flavor
this
beer
versus
more
but
worse
flavor
its
competitor
my
preference
should
be
obvious
by
the
scores
ive
granted
i
really
hate
to
use
the
word
preference
in
that
context
since
my
real
preference
is
to
be
drinking
better
beer
i
fell
like
all
light
beers
are
the
same
but
thsi
one
isnt
as
bad
as
some
of
the
ones
ive
had
i
usually
have
a
lot
of
these
and
its
nonlight
counter
part
when
i
got
to
buffalo
apparently
canadian
beer
is
big
over
there
jaja
anyway
the
beer
is
a
light
gold
color
with
very
little
head
that
quickly
disappears
tatse
of
some
maltines
and
some
hops
during
gth
after
tste
a
smooth
mouthfeel
that
isnt
dry
at
all
smell
is
mostly
og
grain
and
alcohol
pours
a
very
pale
straw
hue
with
excellent
clarity
the
bubbly
white
head
reaches
only
one
finger
in
height
but
holds
well
little
to
no
lacing
faint
grain
adjunct
smell
mostly
clean
the
taste
is
equally
bland
some
grain
adjuncts
and
slight
hop
bite
that
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
worth
mentioning
thin
body
and
high
carbonation
make
up
a
crisp
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
not
bad
for
a
light
lager
and
it
is
fairly
balanced
but
its
so
thin
that
eventually
the
alcohol
is
percived
and
detracts
from
its
drinkability
pours
a
white
five
fingerhead
that
vanishes
almost
instantly
leaving
no
lace
clear
very
pale
amber
color
no
noticeable
carbonation
and
very
light
bodied
nose
may
be
a
faint
sweet
hay
starts
with
no
hops
or
malts
finish
is
almost
like
water
even
a
bad
lawn
mower
beer
the
canadians
can
brew
a
decent
light
keiths
but
this
isnt
it
1
45
for
a
340ml
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
this
is
an
average
beer
way
too
much
head
in
my
opinion
average
color
and
taste
heavy
for
a
light
beer
the
regular
is
much
better
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
wouldnt
run
out
and
buy
a
twelve
pack
better
than
labbatts

on
any

lead
to

pass

bottle
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
fizzy
head
well
it
doesnt
smell
bad
it
just
doesnt
smell
like
much
at
all
i
get
a
weak
nose
of
some
sweet
malts
and
that
macro
adjuct
aroma
the
taste
isnt
offensive
just
watered
down
typical
thin
light
beer
with
a
hint
more
flavor
than
its
american
counterparts
clear
very
light
gold
color
like
many
a
light
american
lager
almost
no
head
smell
is
slightly
grassy
with
malt
but
does
have
som
adjunct
tones
taste
is
relatively
bland
just
light
malt
and
no
noticable
hops
no
better
or
worse
than
many
american
light
lagers
just
another
choice
overall
impression
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
im
not
a
fan
of
light
beers
but
this
seems
to
be
better
than
a
lot
of
the
bmc
offerings
poures
a
lite
golden
color
with
a
1
figer
head
after
a
fairly
agressive
pour
ok
lace
not
much
smell
here
which
is
average
for
a
lite
beer
very
faint
malt
smells
with
even
fainter
hop
smells
picking
up
some
corn
and
rice
smells
as
well
taste
is
ok
for
a
lite
some
subtle
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
hops
watery
but
that
is
pretty
much
what
i
expected
is
better
than
other
more
popular
lites
ab
and
worse
than
others
sam
adams
an
average
lite
beer
thx
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
is
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
scent
there
is
also
the
aroma
of
some
pale
malts
and
brewing
adjuncts
the
taste
is
above
average
it
has
a
smooth
taste
with
a
clean
yet
dry
finish
it
has
no
malt
complexity
at
all
but
is
low
in
carbs
the
mouthfeel
is
above
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
well
its
a
little
better
than
most
light
beers
ive
had
just
imagine
canadian
watered
down
terrible
this
crystal
clear
yellow
beer
came
to
me
with
a
nice
manufactured
head
it
was
gone
in
seconds
the
smell
was
of
corn
and
there
wasnt
much
of
that
there
was
a
buttery
taste
i
dont
know
much
but
i
know
that
this
is
not
a
good
thing
i
also
had
a
hint
of
grains
to
finish
it
off
a
bitter
aftertaste
wow
a
light
beer
with
some
actual
taste
in
the
world
of
light
beers
this
one
stands
out
albeit
slightly
pours
out
to
a
light
golden
color
in
the
glass
with
some
lively
carbonation
going
on
not
much
aromawise
with
a
hint
of
cooked
veggies
coming
through
the
taste
is
decent
bordering
on
good
there
is
a
bit
of
hop
bit
on
the
swallow
which
actually
shocked
me
a
bit
as
good
as
sam
adams
light
and
one
of
the
better
if
not
best
if
there
is
such
a
thing
interpretations
of
a
light
beer
but
the
taste
for
a
light
was
acceptable
evenly
balanced
litely
hopped
and
finished
better
than
anticapated
to
the
malts
again
lightly
the
appearance
smell
and
taste
of
this
light
beer
are
definately
more
subdued
in
the
canned
version
as
compared
to
the
bottled
version
this
had
less
hop
flavor
more
wateriness
and
more
husk
flavors
and
sweetness
than
the
regular
version
but
once
you
get
past
that
the
two
are
very
closely
related
not
too
bad
for
a
light
beer
although
i
certainly
do
not
plan
to
drink
this
regularly
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
as
clean
as
clean
gets
notes
all
i
would
want
in
a
light
beer
if
i
like
the
style
it
holds
a
touch
more
flavour
than
most
light
beers
and
does
not
stray
into
any
cooked
veggie
or
odd
corn
aromas
or
flavours
if
you
like
light
beer
this
one
might
be
for
you
i
really
do
not
care
for
this
beer
or
any
molson
beer
it
gives
me
really
bad
gas
light
color
and
body
with
no
hops
or
malt
just
a
bunch
of
corn
and
rice
my
mother
in
law
comes
and
she
brings
the
crap
so
i
have
to
drink
it
and
my
wife
puts
up
with
the
gas
i
drank
a
few
which
says
a
lot
for
a
light
beer
this
had
a
little
more
flavor
than
other
lights
but
it
still
lacked
i
would
take
it
over
bud
coors
miller
any
day
but
i
dont
think
i
will
take
it
at
all
so
far
no
light
beers
have
really
done
it
for
me
except
for
sam
adams
lights
are
just
not
fantastic
golden
in
color
and
the
lace
actually
is
sticking
all
the
way
down
the
glass
very
smooth
not
much
flavor
at
all
and
a
bit
watery
therefore
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
have
had
a
few
already
and
am
feeling
nothing
definitely
a
better
light
than
the
budmillercoors
light
offerings
oh
well
i
think
its
defunct
anyway
but
hey
cheers
even
worse
than
the
original
this
beer
has
a
good
rating
by
the
bros
and
there
right
its
not
bad
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
light
beer
which
is
a
plus
doesnt
taste
as
bad
as
regular
old
mil
or
god
awful
milwaukees
beast
its
a
great
water
beer
smooth
for
a
light
beer
drink
a
hundred
and
still
drive
home
overall
a
4
for
the
underdog
known
as
old
milwaukee

wish
i
woulda

this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
this
is
a
filtered
brew
you
can
see
right
though
it
the
smell
is
nice
with
some
grains
and
malt
the
taste
is
light
but
rich
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
for
being
a
light
brew
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
body
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
old
milwaukee
light
has
a
real
nice
balance
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
clean
and
refreshing
pabst
brewing
company
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
75
out
5
perfectly
acceptable
if
youre
looking
to
get
drunk
in
mass
quantity
on
a
tight
budget
overall
incredibly
bland
normal
perfectly
average
nothing
like
a
can
of
fresh
toilet
water
to
make
your
day
shine
but
to
be
serious
i
have
had
many
great
times
hanging
with
friends
while
drinking
this
beer
so
out
of
respect
for
old
mil
light
and
all
the
great
times
and
memories
i
have
been
given
i
wanted
to
give
this
beer
a
good
review
smc
serving
type
can
presentation
packaged
in
a

fluid
ounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a

belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
something
light
then
this
is
your
choice
its
flavors
are
super
mellow
it
is
very
wateryhighly
drinkable
and
decently
refreshing
now
this
is
what
spelunky
ordered
it
pours
a
clear
pale
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
hard
water
sweet
corn
and
light
rice
the
taste
mirrors
things
nearly
identically
though
the
hard
water
is
definitely
on
display
here
yay
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
if
i
were
actually
drinking
this
for
the
fun
of
it
id
probably
be
even
more
unhappy
than
i
am
this
is
best
suited
for
quick
alcoholdelivery
systems
like
beer
pong
or
other
drinking
games
sad
rjt
i
tasted
this
beer
and
the
flavor
and
taste
are
just
awesome
but
i
search
for
light
beer
for
my
grandfather
i
like
its
smell
hope
you
can
help
me
in
my
search
listshttpwww
ranker
comcrowdrankedlistthebesttastinglightbeers
d
this
beer
as
about
as
bland
as
they
come
and
as
low
of
an
abv
as
youll
find
in
a
nonna
beer
but
those
traits
also
make
the
beer
poundable
overall
however
there
are
several
other
inexpensive
options
out
there
that
are
better
taste
is
light
no
surprise
and
watery
the
only
real
flavor
is
a
corny
maltiness
and
little
if
any
hops
presence
maybe
this
one
has
won
recent
gabf
awards
but
its
still
a
typical
american
adjunct
lager
average
at
best
wouldnt
buy
again
not
going
to
take
a
typical
review
format
with
this
one
because
theres
not
much
to
it
adjuncts
a
light
amount
of
hops
and
some
malted
barley
in
a
great
combination
though
this
is
my
goto
light
beer
its
well
balanced
and
actually
offers
hints
of
flavor
compared
to
its
competitors
not
tinny
or
metallic
like
lots
of
other
beers
of
this
caliber
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
taste
barely
any
super
miniscule
hop
presence
super
miniscule
malt
presence
mostly
corn
and
six
row
a
decent
cheap
alternative
to
keith
stone
and
better
in
my
opinion
same
demographic
its
peddaled
too
at
least
if
youre
a
somewhat
responsible
adult
you
can
just
call
it
a
lawnmower
beer
americas
best
tasting
beer
well
thats
what
is
says
on
the
can
world
beer
cup
gold
winner
in
2008
for
american
style
light
lager
really
its
a
good
light
beer
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
color
with
white
head
that
dwindles
quickly
flavor
wise
there
isnt
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
especially
when
served
cold
smell
is
some
cooked
veggies
with
even
a
hint
of
herbal
hop
notes
really
vintage
old
school
beer
like
this
isnt
bad
compared
to
the
masses
its
just
as
good
or
better
plus
a
12
pack
of
this
runs
6
49
since
that
is
rediculously
cheap
its
a
bonus
to
this
light
lager
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
sturdy
carbonation
nothing
exciting
but
its
cold
and
wet
overall
an
affordable
good
beer
thats
good
for
beer
geeks
to
try
to
appreciate
what
we
have
in
craft
beer
and
have
an
option
amongst
bigger
brewers
to
justify
not
drinking
bmc
a
friend
turned
me
onto
this
beer
and
im
very
glad
he
did
it
is
a
step
above
other
mass
produced
light
lagers
and
is
one
of
the
best
values
out
there
12
oz
straight
out
of
the
can
although
ive
had
it
in
a
glass
too
slightly
orangewater
color
no
smell
clean
not
much
in
the
taste
not
much
hops
or
malt
goes
down
as
easy
as
well
as
easy
as
water
seriously
one
of
the
better
light
beers
around
overall
this
is
the
best
light
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
am
not
going
to
just
rate
this
as
a
premium
or
craft
beer
because
its
unfair
and
fails
the
test
i
reviewed
this
compared
to
others
for
what
it
is
a
light
beer
i
can
say
that
if
i
am
ever
in
a
light
beer
mood
i
will
gladly
seek
and
buy
this
one
again
in
conclusion
this
makes
you
realize
that
light
beer
is
not
about
an
exotic
blend
of
tastes
but
clean
and
refreshing
taste
this
beer
accomplishes
that
for
a
light
beer
its
not
bad
still
its
a
little
to
watery
i
can
foresee
this
being
chugged
at
american
frat
houses
d
had
about
four
in
really
fast
succession
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
grains
taste
is
very
mild
really
nothing
here
at
all
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
low
quality
beer
overall
old
milwaukee
light
is
the
best
light
brew
on
the
market
why
pay
more
when
you
can
get
the
best
for
less
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
that
fell
like
the
housing
market
color
was
a
light
strawyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
lightly
malty
sweet
with
a
cereal
quality
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
a
light
sweetness
along
with
a
slight
cereal
quality
finish
was
thin
bland
unassuming
fizzy
yellow
beer
sucks
and
a
lot
of
it
is
in
cans
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
14inch
head
of
a
clear
color
with
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
of
adjunct
in
a
clean
lager
fits
the
style
of
a
light
lager
has
a
smooth
and
crisp
mouth
feel
theres
a
high
carbonation
level
present
tastes
of
adjunct
mostly
with
a
strong
lager
characteristic
slight
malt
background
is
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
overall
another
light
lager
which
is
definitely
not
my
favorite
style
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
but
considerable
carbonation
that
bubbles
all
through
the
session
the
aroma
is
grassy
and
corny
but
if
you
take
a
deep
enough
whiff
you
might
catch
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
a
light
macros
but
it
doesnt
seem
quite
as
watered
down
the
taste
also
has
some
vague
hops
but
little
to
no
alcohol
sensation
actually
it
is
not
quite
as
bad
as
some
of
the
previous
reviewers
have
claimed
if
you
go
into
a
can
of
it
expecting
it
to
taste
like
your
favorite
pale
ale
well
youre
not
gonna
like
it
if
you
just
want
a
refreshing
easydrinking
light
lager
that
is
light
on
the
billfold
i
think
youve
found
your
new
beer
i
went
into
this
review
not
expecting
much
guess
what
i
got
in
return
not
much
a
yellowish
color
under
some
fizzy
river
suds
smells
and
taste
like
a
hybrid
between
rice
corn
and
garbage
water
watery
but
fizzy
body
maybe
someday
i
will
find
a
light
lager
that
does
not
give
me
bad
dreams
this
beer
i
have
known
since
i
was
a
child
i
grew
up
with
tihis
beer
and
i
will
die
with
tis
beer
the
taste
is
very
good
compares
with
other
lagers
in
this
field
the
drinkability
is
as
always
quick
to
down
in
an
instant
the
taste
is
very
good
in
a
premium
lager
i
reammend
this
beer
to
many
others
to
try
i
was
given
an
old
milwaukee
light
at
a
get
together
when
nothing
else
was
available
this
beer
is
pale
in
color
no
foamy
head
skunky
and
green
both
in
taste
and
aroma
i
dont
think
i
got
a
bad
can
i
think
this
beer
just
flat
out
sucks
who
drinks
this
shit
this
was
so
bad
it
gave
me
a
headache
cheaply
made
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
drank
in
my
life
pale
gold
with
a
head
that
goes
away
right
away
this
beer
smells
like
cheerios
it
smells
just
like
when
you
open
a
box
of
cheerios
and
take
a
wiff
so
i
guess
i
could
say
om
light
has
a
cereal
grain
odor
it
tastes
ok
for
a
cheap
crappy
light
beer
not
too
bitter
or
rancid
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
it
watery
and
thin
and
doesnt
taste
completely
crappy
therefore
i
say
its
pretty
drinkable
no
terrible
aftertaste
either
i
dont
much
care
for
this
style
of
beer
but
for
this
style
of
beer
its
a
pretty
decent
one

friend
old
milwaukee
light
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
huge
white
head
from
a
twelve
ounce
can
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
a
bit
of
cereal
grain
and
if
you
take
a
big
whiff
you
get
musty
which
almost
gives
it
an
industrial
like
quality
this
is
a
light
sweet
flavored
beer
tasting
mostly
of
cereal
grains
but
it
finishes
very
clean
better
than
i
expected
and
not
bad
for
a
beer
in
its
style
the
can
says
americas
best
tasting
beer
i
wouldnt
go
quite
that
far
fairly
refreshing
but
nothing
remarkable
about
the
taste
good
for
a
warm
day
d
not
great
tasting
but
easy
drinking
makes
a
good
lawnmower
beer
drinkability
a
little
more
character
than
many
macro
lights
but
not
a
flavor
i
would
return
for
gets
a
bump
for
being
reeealll
cheap
and
for
referring
to
that
queen
of
cities
milwaukee
a
refreshing
light
beer
with
the
low
alcohol
you
could
pound
a
number
of
these
with
the
pleasant
aftertaste
you
may
find
yourself
wanting
more
than
1
can
of
this
stuff
definately
one
of
my
top
3
light
macros
if
nothing
else
for
lack
of
unpleasant
aftertaste
and
presence
of
some
flavor
throughout
go
with
om
regular
if
not
calorie
conscious
for
more
flavor
pours
a
thin
piss
yellow
body
with
zero
head
smells
literally
like
musty
sweat
somehow
some
way
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
taste
is
surprisingly
not
bad
a
bit
of
bite
at
the
start
and
no
apparent
aftertaste
but
nothing
special
mouthfeel
is
what
all
light
macros
feel
like
watery
definitely
easy
to
drink
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
with
almost
no
taste
or
alcohol
content
or
something
to
funnel
at
a
party
usually
hot
day
out
here
in
michigan
time
for
a
lighter
beer
might
as
well
finish
off
this
30
pack
i
enjoyed
while
camping
last
weekend
very
light
in
color
slight
head
nicely
carbonated
aroma
is
almost
nothing
slightly
grainy
but
rather
clean
taste
is
very
clean
almost
too
clean
no
off
flavors
nice
long
smooth
body
but
not
much
else
great
camping
beer
not
too
good
of
a
tasting
beer
not
as
flavorful
as
the
miller
lite
i
had
before
this
one
well
made
just
weak
and
unflavorful
in
the
end
final
thoughts
i
remember
when
i
was
a
senior
in
high
school
and
got
a
job
in
the
spring
summer
in
1992
at
the
husker
coop
in
columbus
ne
anyone
who
has
spent
time
on
the
farm
will
know
what
im
talking
about
every
friday
was
payday
and
someone
would
run
over
to
this
little
grocery
store
and
pick
up
a
case
of
this
the
guys
who
worked
there
were
all
farmers
or
retired
from
farming
and
in
our
area
this
is
what
the
farmers
drank
at
the
time
now
its
busch
light
i
would
head
up
to
the
office
to
clock
out
and
grab
my
paycheck
and
theyd
always
offer
me
a
couple
i
always
said
yeah
even
though
i
didnt
really
like
this
stuff
but
it
always
made
me
feel
good
like
the
old
guys
repsected
me
enough
to
share
their
beer
with
aah
good
times
when
things
were
simple
just
a
random
old
beer
memory
not
a
bad
light
beer
pours
a
light
gold
clear
highly
carbonated
appearance
with
a
big
ass
fizzy
white
head
nose
is
light
cooked
cornbody
is
light
but
with
a
little
substance
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
slight
maltiness
evident
there
is
more
to
this
than
say
coors
light
no
bad
off
flavors
finishes
with
a
little
dryness
to
it
really
not
bad
at
all
won
a
few
honors
as
best
tasting
light
beer
and
it
doesnt
shock
me
i
like
a
few
others
better
but
its
splitting
hairs
sometimes
with
the
light
beers
and
this
one
does
not
offend
and
actually
has
a
small
whiff
of
character
a
straight
forward
light
version
of
its
full
flavored
brother
watery
taste
with
medium
light
carbonation
and
weak
flavor
of
corn
and
hops
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
many
other
brews
id
much
rather
have
first
overall
not
bad
but
once
again
nothing
special
it
was
an
old
milwaukee
that
was
my
first
beer
when
i
was
15
years
old
so
when
my
buddy
was
drinking
it
last
night
i
asked
him
for
a
trip
down
memory
lane
i
drank
it
right
out
of
the
12
oz
can
smells
was
a
little
stale
with
some
corn
and
malt
noticable
taste
was
pretty
watered
down
not
much
in
the
hops
department
or
flavor
department
in
general
this
sample
made
me
realize
why
i
didnt
make
a
point
of
having
one
of
these
in
the
past
6
years
not
that
bad
but
not
many
redeeming
qualities
except
its
price
its
not
that
bad
but
its
also
not
that
good
its
just
there
there
was
nothing
that
stood
out
about
this
one
except
the
fact
that
it
tastes
like
regular
bud
which
is
ok
for
a
light
beer
im
definately
not
a
bud
fan
but
i
would
choose
this
over
it
because
it
is
the
same
thing
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
its
a
major
beer
here
at
crabford
i
mean
radford
university
its
cheap
and
freshman
chicks
dont
know
the
difference
so
its
a
frat
boys
best
friend
notes
this
is
what
a
light
beer
is
supposed
to
be
if
i
was
a
light
beer
drinker
this
is
the
one
i
would
go
for
time
and
time
again
not
bad
for
a
bad
beer
very
thin
pale
straw
a
thin
sheet
of
a
soapy
head
that
evaporates
quickly
some
light
malty
aroma
tough
to
pick
up
much
on
the
nose
thin
weak
and
a
watery
body
noted
consistently
through
a
few
of
these
some
delicate
malts
detected
throughout
nothing
offensive
yet
nothing
to
reel
you
in
for
more
however
as
well
balanced
it
seems
it
quickly
stops
no
lingering
here
no
personality
either
this
is
a
light
version
of
a
very
cheap
beer
so
i
wasnt
expecting
much
pours
with
almost
no
head
when
ice
cold
taste
is
very
weak
and
watered
down
what
taste
you
get
is
slight
malted
grain
and
only
a
very
shadow
of
hops
a
very
poor
example
of
a
light
beer
in
conclusion
this
beer
actually
reminds
me
of
schaefer
light
perhaps
with
a
little
less
flavor
this
beer
is
not
outstanding
in
any
way
but
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
offend
my
taste
buds
either
the
last
time
i
tasted
this
beer
it
wasnt
to
bad
it
had
an
average
flavor
and
the
taste
was
also
average
although
i
was
drinking
this
beer
as
i
was
playing
horseshoes
in
100
degree
weather
at
that
time
i
would
say
anything
would
have
tasted
good
before
then
i
tried
it
once
and
have
tasted
worst
this
actually
wasnt
a
bad
beer
if
the
folks
who
produce
it
could
get
rid
of
the
egg
smell
and
give
it
some
color
it
would
be
a
decent
light
beer
as
it
is
right
now
its
better
than
some
because
it
is
completely
inoffensive
i
have
to
admit
to
drinking
this
a
lot
in
my
college
days
it
was
our
house
beer
of
choice
and
was
priced
right
for
a
case
of
returnable
bottles
after
all
these
years
after
sampling
it
again
i
see
it
wasnt
such
a
bad
choice
of
course
it
has
the
usual
adjunct
aroma
and
taste
but
its
not
obnoxious
or
offending
it
actually
tastes
good
and
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
for
light
macro
swill
one
could
do
a
lot
worse
ah
the
memories
but
dont
worry
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
anytime
soon
age
and
wisdom
have
taken
over
and
the
beer
world
has
opened
up
to
me
in
ways
i
never
dreamed
of
ten
years
ago
tastes
like
regular
old
milwaukee
after
some
ice
cubes
melted
in
it
very
clear
color
absent
of
any
hops
that
i
could
detect
i
dont
think
they
use
any
barley
either
it
is
drinkable
but
so
is
antifreeze
metallic
this
beer
actually
has
a
cold
metal
taste
to
it
very
water
and
highly
carbonated
not
a
good
beer
at
all
light
pleasant
malt
aroma
full
bubbly
head
that
leaves
rather
quickly
pale
straw
color
very
light
on
flavor
from
start
through
the
finish
no
hop
qualities
light
and
quick
dry
finish
that
lacks
crispness
mouthfeel
very
thin
despite
the
full
carbonation
its
as
bad
as
keystone
a
nice
option
when
its
hot
and
out
fishing
can
drink
them
all
day
in
the
heat
with
little
or
no
effect
good
beer
for
parties
and
very
light
perfect
for
drinking
games
very
clear
color
and
good
taste
for
a
light
beer
way
ahead
of
miller
lite
really
i
have
to
justify
my
rating
with
a
review
look
its
just
a
beer
a
cheap
light
beer
no
its
not
what
id
buy
and
after
a
year
and
a
half
in
rochester
this
was
the
first
time
i
tried
it
so
that
tells
you
something
right
there
but
if
you
go
to
a
friends
house
and
they
offer
you
beer
you
drink
it
and
you
dont
make
a
big
deal
about
the
extreme
inferiority
of
the
beer
compared
to
what
you
usually
drink
so
my
2
whatever
rating
is
an
outlier
fine

o

made
it
somewhat

this
is
better
than
mcb
light
beer
but
im
not
buying
this
one
again
overall
its
clearly
an
average
beer
at
best
during
college
i
drank
quite
a
few
labatt
blue
lights
and
enjoyed
them
my
appreciation
for
beer
has
changed
now
though
and
i
would
consider
this
beer
nothing
special
but
something
i
will
drink
when
on
special
when
i
am
out
for
dinner
cheap
light
beer
with
a
cheap
light
taste
no
hops
to
taste
no
malt
flavors
that
youd
typically
get
in
a
craft
beer
just
a
mild
cereal
grain
flavor
with
corn
and
subtle
sweetness
it
costs
a
bit
more
than
a
madeinamerica
adjunct
lager
and
it
tastes
basically
the
same
still
i
think
id
choose
a
labatt
light
over
a
bud
light
coors
light
or
even
miller
lite
when
i
had
labatt
blue
light
it
was
on
tap
at
a
bar
the
coloring
was
a
light
yellowclear
and
i
had
the
aroma
of
corn
in
it
for
sure
and
a
little
malty
the
taste
was
a
little
blan
probably
because
it
was
light
and
not
just
labatt
blue
it
was
also
medium
carbonated
notes
this
is
product
weak
insip
boring
hated
it
amazingly
this
beer
sells
like
crazy
here
in
rochester
which
makes
no
sense
as
genny
is
much
better
and
a
lot
cheaper
pass
for
a
major
light
lager
its
not
bad
compared
to
some
of
the
others
it
lacks
flavor
just
mostly
sweet
and
light
o
overall
this
was
a
less
than
standard
light
lager
that
i
wouldnt
buy
again
you
can
get
a
value
pack
at
kroger
which
consists
of
twenty
cans
for
eleven
dollars
this
is
something
that
you
bring
to
a
party
for
everyone
else
that
way
nobody
asks
for
and
usually
wastes
your
good
beer
marginally
better
than
a
bud
light
but
still
this
is
probably
closer
to
water
than
it
is
to
beer
not
much
happening
at
all
rjt
i
love
this
beer
it
is
affordable
and
gets
the
job
done
when
needed
i
live
in
tennessee
and
am
happy
to
find
it
at
my
local
krogers
now
i
used
to
only
get
it
when
visiting
family
in
michigan
the
thing
i
love
about
going
up
north
is
that
in
the
winter
we
leave
the
beer
outside
and
it
is
the
perfect
temperature
i
love
it
when
it
is
slushy
as
the
crappy
light
mass
market
stuff
goes
i
dont
hate
this
in
a
bottle
thats
ice
cold
drafts
and
cans
of
this
are
almost
intolerable
but
the
bottle
can
work
on
a
hot
day
out
in
the
boat
or
something
golf
course
maybe
pours
watery
pale
yellow
like
so
many
beers
like
this
do
decent
head
though
smells
like
basically
nothing
just
some
weak
generic
malts
flavor
is
refreshing
at
least
but
it
has
nothing
intersting
to
call
out
quick
snappy
finish
probably
helps
it
sell
as
well
as
it
does
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
a
little
too
carbonated
but
i
will
give
it
high
marks
for
drinkability
overall
its
a
step
up
from
a
budlight
but
so
is
everything
only
when
i
have
to
overall
to
be
honest
do
not
care
for
this
beer
however
i
could
enjoy
it
on
a
very
hot
day
with
no
other
drink
available
reviewed
from
notes
o
very
light
an
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
when
it
is
really
cold
sessionable
but
not
a
beer
that
im
going
to
go
back
to
often
maybe
best
served
when
fishing
definitely
recommend
drinking
this
beer
when
it
is
very
cold
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
for
the
style
it
has
more
flavor
than
most
others
its
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
isnt
my
style
of
choice
but
this
is
a
light
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
overall
as
for
light
beers
this
is
not
the
greatest
to
say
the
least
if
you
really
want
a
light
beer
do
something
like
a
sam
adams
light
or
a
other
lower
abv
beers
such
as
guinness
draught
this
is
not
the
best
the
color
is
clear
straw
and
bubbly
with
something
of
a
head
and
no
lacing
malt
scent
basically
what
you
would
expect
labatt
blue
light
is
number
two
gonna
drink
it
with
my
left
over
pizza
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
an
intial
foamy
white
head
that
dissapates
to
nothing
the
smell
and
taste
is
typical
grain
with
mild
hop
just
enought
to
attempt
to
balance
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
big
overall
is
typical
drinkable
but
not
notable
o
when
youve
gotta
drink
something
drink
something
else
overall
its
odd
that
this
beers
slogan
used
to
be
if
i
wanted
a
water
id
ask
for
it
its
actually
pretty
watery
and
tasteless
it
also
has
too
much
carbonation
not
something
i
intend
on
having
again
but
i
didnt
turn
it
away
when
someone
offered
me
it
overall
my
score
pretty
much
says
it
all
not
impressed
im
sure
ill
be
drinking
this
just
to
fit
in
and
look
cool
for
the
most
part
adjunct
lagers
are
the
same
thing
across
the
board

it
certainly
isnt

the

is
a

recedes
within

to

thay
tryed
to
strip
this
one
of

smoother

budweiser

me

nothing
special
about

actually

surely

quenching
after

as
much
as
a

water
this
is
my
familys
favorite
beer
so
i
get
to
taste
it
often
i
once
drank
one
with
very
nice
flavour
and
smell
i
think
it
was
very
fresh
out
of
the
factory
every
other
time
its
a
very
bad
tasteless
beer
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
corn
taste
is
well
i
would
describe
it
if
it
had
one
a
touch
of
grain
a
very
light
sweetness
feels
watery
in
the
mouth
and
overall
even
for
this
style
is
lacking
in
any
flavor
tecate
light
is
one
of
the
most
forgettable
beers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
but
not
because
its
bad
but
because
its
indifferent
and
thoroughly
unimpressive
smells
alright
tastes
like
a
good
adjunct
lager
if
the
abv
of
3
7
is
correct
then
this
is
a
perfect
summer
barbeque
beer
and
it
is
better
tasting
than
most
of
the
more
popular
light
beers
mouthfeel
was
light
and
very
fizzy
from
the
can
also
quite
refreshing
went
on
a
little
family
vacation
to
mexico
and
the
mini
fridge
was
stocked
with
these
not
normlly
a
fan
of
light
beer
on
general
but
a
ticker
is
gonna
tick
poured
from
the
can
to
a
glass
look
was
pale
yellow
with
a
big
fizzy
lager
head
and
some
visible
carb
loos
like
a
light
beer
and
not
all
that
appetizing
but
dont
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
right
nose
is
corn
and
grain
flavor
is
pretty
much
absent
but
what
is
there
is
grainy
and
fairlt
meh
mouth
is
light
and
fizzy
i
would
say
that
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
drink
all
day
but
honestly
i
am
nit
going
to
make
it
through
the
can
call
me
a
beer
snob
but
this
just
isnt
good
you
guys
are
fing
clowns
tminus
is
the
most
versatile
beer
in
the
world
you
can
drink
it
when
it
is
warm
it
is
100
degrees
out
and
it
delicious
furthermore
you
can
drink
it
when
its
chilled
to
perfection
and
its
more
delicious
or
deliciouser
also
there
is
alot
of
water
in
it
so
you
can
stay
hydrated
consider
it
the
most
top
notch
light
day
drinking
beer
youve
ever
pressed
your
fairy
little
lips
to
sack
up
bruh
yeah
i
almost
like
this
better
than
regular
tecate
which
i
now
recall
overcooking
a
rack
of
lamb
while
reviewing
this
is
a
soda
light
pop
beer
fizzy
and
pale
golden
without
much
malt
or
hops
distinguishable
in
the
nose
or
the
taste
but
an
element
of
refreshment
without
all
of
the
adjunct
or
metallic
crap
flavors
of
the
usual
macro
light
brew
honestly
with
a
lime
its
entirely
passable
as
a
buzz
holder
in
other
words
a
beer
you
sip
on
after
youve
got
a
mellow
going
that
will
just
maintain
you
when
you
dont
want
to
deplete
the
stash
of
anything
worthwhile
not
impressive
by
any
stretch
but
i
would
take
this
over
many
other
garbage
beers
in
the
fiesta
cooler
yeah
i
could
have
tecate
but
why
risk
all
those
unnecessary
calories
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
funky
wheat
sweet
corn
light
white
bread
and
plenty
of
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
extra
hard
water
and
extra
funk
on
the
wheat
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
this
stuff
is
too
weak
on
every
front
to
be
more
enjoyable
than
a
bottle
of
evian
pass
aromas
of
light
stale
beer
light
corn
and
some
grain
flavors
are
the
same
not
much
else
for
a
basic
pale
ale
watered
down
overall
nothing
that
makes
this
beer
stand
out
decent
overall
due
to
the
heat
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
one
again
rjt
o
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
very
poor
its
meant
to
be
drank
ice
cold
in
large
quantities
and
for
that
type
of
beer
there
are
much
better
alternatives
same
old
song
and
dance
kinda
beer
maybe
be
alright
on
a
real
hot
summer
day
when
your
out
on
the
lake
and
theres
not
much
choice
i
had
a
hard
time
telling
this
apart
from
regular
tecate
so
i
guess
thats
a
good
thing
for
a
light
beer
ive
honestly
never
seen
tecate
light
until
i
came
across
this
at
my
local
distributor
in
pa
needless
to
say
i
had
to
get
it
considering
the
fact
that
were
going
to
a
primusgogol
bordello
and
pirates
game
this
week
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
in
a
cooler
to
mess
with
your
friends
only
3

it
could
be
a
marathon
beer
for
a
hot

and
its
not
has
horrible
as
the
reviews
entail
on
this
website

creamed

all

a

husk
and
corn
resides
in
this
beer
flavor
reveals
a
clean
grainy
creamed
corn
flavor
with
minimal
hop
flavor
going
on
overall
a
one
dimensional
canned
beer
from
mexico
that
has
fulfilled
some
highlighted
qualities
like
cold
refreshing
macro
lager
status
with
a
hint
of
cheap
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
yellow
and
fizzy
all
of
the
way
mouthfeel
is
the
same
so
watery
and
with
so
light
carbonation
it
makes
you
wonder
why
its
called
a
beer
f
what
do
we
expect
this
is
commercial
mexican
lager
done
light
wish
i
hadnt
poured
it
actually
tastes
better
from
the
can
head
dissipated
faster
than
anything
i
can
recall
leaving
a
few
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
a
very
pale

colored

smells
of
musty
corn
and
damp
grains
taste
minimal
watery
mildly
macrolager
tasting
less
carbonation
when
poured
than
when
consumed
out
of
the

seriously
dont
pour
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
is
exactly
what
it
is
when
consumed

out
of

the
beers
is
good
with
lime
and
salt
and
with
mexican
food
but
is
very
poor
by
itself
tecate
light
a
lighter
version
of
tecate
and
as
in
most
mexican
beers
taste
best
in
the
summer
with
a
lime
however
judging
tecate
light
solo
its
just
another
no
frills
cerveza
the
beer
poors
golden
clear
with
good
carbonation
that
give
a
white
foamy
head
for
a
brief
time
the
smell
and
taste
are
enhanced
with
grain
the
hops
help
somewhat
with
the
taste

that
it
is

is
easy

drinkability
the
taste
isnt
horrible
but
its
not
in
any
way
complex
or
intriguing
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
so
it
probably
serves
its
purpose
sigh
i
know
people
who
swear
by
this
beer
and
drink
it
all
the
time
and
im
left
wondering
whats
the
point
d
as
awful
as
i
made
this
beer
sound
its
actually
much
better
than
the
regular
tecate
this
beer
is
not
unique
at
all
its
just
another
watery
light
beer
however
it
has
a
low
alcohol
content
compared
to
most
light
lagers
i
cant
see
any
reason
to
buy
this
beer
there
are
plenty
of
other
light
lagers
that
go
down
just
as
easy
and
have
a
greater
alcohol
content
this
is
like
tecate
but
worst
can
you
imagine
the
head
foamed
up
and
quickly
receded
whoops
the
color
was
a
golden
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
cereal
sweetness
of
adjuncts
uh
oh
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
definite
presence
of
adjuncts
but
not
not
as
prevalently
as
i
have
experienced
in
regularleaded
beers
taste
was
mild
and
smooth
with
a
cereal
flavor
throughout
hmm
finish
was
mildly
maltycereal
ho
hum
jack
you
did
not
miss
much
rip
old
buddy
taste
is
very
similar
to
a
lessthanfully
carbonated
perrier
sparkling
water
a
few
hints
of
cardboard
with
a
dab
of
sweet
honeydew
melon
mmmm
doesnt
that
sound
good
well
its
not
pretty
damn
watery
with
very
little
appeal
might
work
as
a
beach
beer
but
i
would
drink
a
regular
tecate
before
this
finish
dry
finish
with
bitter
aftertaste
with
metallic
notes
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
18
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
yeast
cleanliness
and
adjunct
fits
the
style
of
a
light
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
adjunct
strong
metallic
flavor
and
slight
yeast
cleanliness
wow
the
least
flavored
beer
ive
ever
had
no
body
at
all
aroma
is
essentially
not
there
and
neither
is
any
taste
it
feels
like
a
pilsner
watered
down
quite
heavily
and
elaborating
on
anything
is
just
making
it
up
horrible
did
not
make
the
grade
even
in
a
beach
at
86
degrees
pours
basically
clear
color
hardly
a
hint
of
yellow
smells
like
tin
foil
tastes
like
seltzer
water
head
is
nonexistant
as
soon
as
the
pour
is
finished
okay
so
maybe
there
is
the
slightest
hint
of
malt
in
the
taste
i
cant
guarantee
that
though
iam
analyzing
the
most
consumed
beer
in
the
northeastern
mexico
the
appearance
is
the
typical
yellow
color
dont
look
bad
but
its
very
simply
theres
no
foam
the
water
have
any
smell
well
this
beer
smell
like
water
the
taste
isnt
bad
just
a
tiny
malt
essence
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
you
feel
like
drinking
mineral
water
without
body
in
the
drinkability
we
have
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
with
low
alcohol
there
are
much
better
mexican
beers
than
this
poured
moderately
yellow
with
no
head
smell
was
just
light
sweet
malt
taste
was
like
corn
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
just
to
keep
it
real
because
thats
how
tecate
light
rolls
it
really
wasnt
that
bad
for
a
light
beer
and
it
definitely
wasnt
offensive
at
all
no
off
flavors
and
went
down
like
water
thanks
tecate
light
sample
handerouters
d
honestly
im
on
my
honeymoon
so
im
inclined
to
be
much
more
happy
with
this
beer
than
i
would
be
back
home
in
springpatch
but
its
a
serviceable
brew
for
beachquaffing
and
its
doing
the
job
despite
the
very
low
alcohol
content
not
a
bad
beach
brew
by
any
means
but
its
not
something
to
seek
out
in
the
states
not
one

my
favorites

for

made
to
kill
thirst
and
help
you
avoid
heatstroke
there
is
some
actual
taste
to
it
and
at
this
alcohol
level
you
are
unlikely
to
be
getting
drunk
from
a
mug
of
it
a

you

you

its

tends
to

sold
in
my

by
his

to

it

not

his
appearance
had
the
distinctive

of
pilsener
beer
drink
directly
from
the
aluminum
can
is
good
well
i
cannot
say
much
in

about
a

beer
no
matter
what
brand
it
is
but
this
at
least
does
not
taste
awfull
just
a
little
of
water
tasting
but
if
you
want
to
hang
with
your
friends
and
not
get
drunk
then
here
you
are
the
flavor
is
a
little
close
to
tecte
regular
but
you
can
get
the
light
angle
my
girlfriend
likes
this
beer
she
said
its
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt

taken
from

very
light
gold
almost
yellow
full
head
which
is
white
and
full
carbonation
cut
straw
in
nose
and
leans
toward
neutrality
flavor
is
of
the
same
cut
straw
and
body
is
chalky
not
right
for
style
all
in
all
not
a
bad
attempt
at
a
light
beer
clear
yellow
light
malty
smell
you
can
find
some
bitterness
some
hops
as
an
aftertaste
and
very
drinkable
in
any
tropical
weather
tecate
light
i
believe
is
only
found
in
mexico
i
had
this
when
down
in
puerto
vallarta
with
some
friends
i
had
this
in
hot
weather
so
in
that
case
it
hit
the
spot
very
cold
and
crisp
it
poured
a
light
yellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
minimul
to
no
lacing
smell
is
of
light
citrus
and
waterdowned
hops
the
taste
has
a
minimul
blast
of
hops
and
alot
duller
than
regular
version
feels
flat
but
crisp
in
mouth
drinkable
in
the
sultry
sun
of
mexico
but
on
any
given
day
this
is
not
the
beer
for
me
aroma
is
skunky
and
white
bread
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
not
much
of
anything
to
this
i
would
only
drink
it
again
if
i
was
getting
paid
not
a
good
beer
dont
waste
money
on
it
when
gotten
with
a
lime
this
is
an
above
average
light
beer
the
worst
beer
manufactured
on
planet
earth
good
beer
if
you
are
headed
to
the
beach
its
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
though
i
think
its
a
fine
beer
when
the
weather
is
warm
and
im
on
the
beach
sometimes
i
enjoy
this
great
with
limes
and
a
relaxing
night
o
k
this
is
a
context
relativistic
issue
for
what
it
is
it
is
ok
fizzy
water
that
wants
to
be
beer
worse
than
extra
just
bad
tastes
like
watered
down
corona
i
like
corona
but
the
light
version
just
isnt
what
you
think
it
would
be
horrible
why
does
anybody
drink
this
stuff
i
dont
even
consider
it
beer
summer
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
lime
not
much
of
a
difference
between
this
the
extra
better
get
an
extra
lemon
for
this
one
if
corona
extra
is
a
drunk
mexicans
piss
in
a
bottle
then
corona
light
is
the
same
drunk
mexicans
piss
in
a
bottle
but
taken
after
he
started
to
sober
up
awful
youre
a
beer
drinker
skip
definitely
skip
not
bad
on
a
boat
after
snorkeling
basically
water
with
a
touch
of
beer
flavor
worse
than
corona
which
is
hard
to
do
not
a
great
beer
but
great
if
you
are
sitting
in
the
sun
and
an
ipa
stonker
would
give
you
an
instant
hangover
if
corona
is
water
then
this
is
diet
water
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
a
refreshing
light
beer
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
what
it
is
refreshing
on
summer
days
in
the
sun
though
despise
the
fame
corona
beers
are
not
good
and
corona
light
is
one
of
the
worst
you
have
to
put
lemon
and
salt
in
order
to
make
it
drinkable
it
gives
a
horrible
after
taste
flavor
not
a
good
beer
but
still
has
a
place
in
the
stock
for
social
events
not
good
has
a
type
of
pond
water
smell
and
taste
to
it
also
not
very
much
flavor
to
it
if
your
going
to
drink
a
light
beer
your
better
off
finding
a
cheap
domestic
brew
this
stuff
is
over
priced
and
tasted
like
skunk
piss
terrible
beer
with
a
wierd
buzz
final

a
regrettable
d
i
have
reviewed
many
americanstyle
adjunct
lagers
and
while
there
are
definitely
a
lot
of
stinkers
in
that
category
there
are
plenty
of
cheap
serviceable
options
as
well
i
often
find
that
the
ba
aggregate
average
overstates
the
crappiness
of
these
types
of
beers
but
corona
light
is
one
instance
where
it
is
spot
on
this
is
inexcusably
offensively
bad
and
just
a
fetid
excuse
for
a
light
beer
all
around
i
would
not
pay
money
for
this
again
and
i
doubt
id
accept
it
as
a
freebie
either
light
beer
fans
can
easily
find
something
that
costs
less
and
doesnt
smell
like
roadkill
great
summertime
outdoors
bbqing
by
the
lake
beer
not
as
good
as
sam
adams
light
but
still
quite
drinkable
overall
a
big
surprise
for
a
light
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
no
fruit
salt
or
anything
else
added
a
skunky
mess
of
a
beer
keeping
in
mind
when
i
drink
beer
i
like
lighter
beers
this
is
a
nice
one
not
the
best
in
the
world
i
drink
these
ice
cold
pretty
bad
if
you
had
tabasco
and
a
lot
of
lime
juice
it
is
still
pretty
bad
overall
2
37
surprisingly
better
than
corona
extra
if
only
for
the
fact
that
theres
less
corona
flavor
i
have
corona
extra
still
here
on
my
desk
i
couldnt
bare
to
finish
it
for
fear
of
illness
and
comparing
the
two
side
by
side
its
easy
to
say
that
corona
light
is
a
more
palatable
drink
that
being
said
its
still
rather
terrible
overall
corona
light
is
an
inoffensive
macro
light
lager
when
i
first
had
it
not
realizing
it
was
the
light
version
thought
something
like
wow
corona
doesnt
taste
as
crappy
as
i
remember
it
in
fact
it
tastes
like
nothing
at
all
i
mean
you
cant
really
rail
on
this
beer
for
being
flavorless
its
nothing
like
the
nauseating
keystone
light
but
then
again
its
pretty
expensive
for
what
it
is
as
far
as
light
beers
go
you
could
do
worse
ive
used
it
for
carmelizing
onions
and
they
turned
out
pretty
well
so
maybe
theres
a
use
for
it
after
all
pours
pretty
much
like
the
regular
corona
which
is
a
pale
strawyellow
a
very
thin
white
head
is
seen
and
its
gone
no
lacing
is
seen
either
the
aroma
is
just
of
some
grass
for
the
most
part
nothing
special
the
taste
is
well
isnt
as
good
as
a
regular
corona
by
any
means
and
is
of
some
grass
with
a
slight
weak
watereddown
finish
nothing
to
get
excited
over
by
any
means
and
glad
i
just
bought
a
single
bottle
for
a
1
00
which
that
is
probably
overpriced
o
it
is
what
it
is
cheap
beer
readily
available
most
anywhere
in
the
us
its
wide
distribution
clear
bottles
and
mass
market
strategy
makes
this
beer
easily
attainable
in
the
us
mexico
and
in
some
other
regions
a
skunky
smell
and
taste
is
typical
and
has
become
characteristical
to
the
beer
light
malt
taste
bitter
aftertaste
and
high
carbonation
represent
this
beers
experience
in
my
mind
reminds
me
of
eating
staleish
popcorn
i
do
find
it
enjoyable
in
certain
occasions
like
lying
in
a
beach
in
mexico
but
by
no
means
is
this
something
i
typically
go
after
o
this
is
towards
the
bottom
of
the
list
for
a
reason
it
is
really
not
very
good
that
being
said
it
is
light
and
drinkable
pretty
much
no
head
on
this
beer
and
is
clear
yellow
doesnt
smell
like
much
of
anything
but
id
definitely
take
this
over
bud
light
coors
light
etc
nice
light
beer
to
have
during
the
summer
at
parties
if
you
want
quantity
quality
this
lowcalorie
beer
is
a
great
option
overall
obviously
grupo
modelo
knows
what
they
are
doing
if
there
was
not
a
demand
for
this
product
it
would
not
be
marketed
quite
frankly
is
the
beer
an
anchor
steam
samuel
adams
defiant
theakston
old
peculiar
dogfish
head
or
delirium

absolutely
not
but
it
holds
a
place
in
the
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
market
that
is
quite
successful
in
all
honesty
the
beer
is
fairly
clean
but
then
again
so
is
water
perhaps
enjoyable
for
its
thirst
quenching
properties
in
the
presence
of
crashing
waves
and
not
air
conditioning
it
might
be
what
beer
drinkers
drink
to
sober
up

its

one
of
the
few
light
beers
i
enjoy
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
mild
bread
and
cornlike
flavors
not
too
terrible
but
certainly
nothing
special
allinall
dreadful
just
a
mess
of
off
aromas
and
flavors
which
do
not
blend
well
together
the
appearance
of
corona
light
was
a
pale
yellow
coloring
it
smelled
a
bit
different
and
maybe
a
little
musty
and
tasted
a
little
watery
i
thought
that
it
went
better
when
i
tried
a
lime
with
it
instead
i
think
that
it
has
a
bland
taste
but
a
nice
appearance
overall
i
recently
had
a
bottle
of
corona
light
this
weekend
it
had
a
clear
yellow
appearance
but
did
not
smell
very
pleasant
in
fact
it
smelled
almost
musty
the
taste
was
similarly
musty
but
and
very
watery
it
felt
very
light
in
my
mouth
and
did
not
have
any
body
at
all
overall
i
would
rate
this
beer
a
1
75
i
was
not
impressed
it
wasnt
terrible
with
a
mexican
food
pairing
but
it
still
did
not
do
much
to
help
the
poor
taste
o
not
offensive
but
not
much
to
like
either
at
least
i
got
a
free
hat
o
overall
terrible
im
pretty
sure
the
only
beer
i
have
ever
had
that
is
worse
than
this
would
have
to
be
steel
reserve
o
i
think
the
review
speaks
for
itself
quite
a
change
to
go
from
my
normal
craft
beer
rotation
to
having
a
glass
of
my
wifes
corona
light
but
it
has
its
purpose
hot
weather
on
the
beach
not
wanting
to
get
full
and
abundance
of
limes
and
salt
and
few
other
options
available
ive
never
been
one
to
decline
a
free
beer
if
i
am
at
a
buddys
house
and
there
is
only
american
adjunct
lager
available
i
will
drink
it
my
sister
offered
me
a
corona
light
at
her
house
she
was
on
a
diet
at
the
time
it
has
a
classic
urine
type
appearance
to
it
as
most
beers
in
this
category
have
it
initially
had
a
skunky
smell
to
it
with
maybe
a
smell
of
water
logged
socks
sitting
in
my
backpack
for
a
week
would
have
thrown
in
the
taste
is
something
awful
its
obviously
very
watered
down
but
it
tastes
just
as
it
smells
i
cringed
the
first
few
sips
then
politely
told
my
sister
i
couldnt
stomach
it
any
longer
i
drank
about
half
of
the
12
ounce
bottle
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
worst
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
and
ive
had
all
of
the
classic
bad
ones
pbr
natural
light
bud
miller
high
life
etc
this
beer
is
an
entirely
new
kind
of
awful
over
all
i
thought
the
beer
to
be
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
and
not
really
thirst
quenching
it
was
a
lot
more
carbonation
than
flavor
happening
for
me
not
a
refreshing
drink
thin
and
watery
body
ample
carbonation
mouthfeel
still
manages
to
lack
crispness
and
a
clean
refreshing
quality
all
the
limes
in
the
world
cant
save
this
one
im
afraid
light
layers
may
not
be
very
good
as
a
group
to
begin
with
but
this
one
comes
close
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
heap
o
theres
a
big
problem
when
a
lime
is
almost
necessary
to
make
a
beer
drinkable
i
couldnt
find
myself
to
finish
it
theres
not
much
to
say
here
im
just
thankful
we
have
great
counterparts
out
there
i
wouldnt
recommend
or
buy
overall
i
have
always
been
told
when
you
have
nothing
nice
to
say
then
say
nothing
at
all
so
although
i
probably
already
said
more
bad
things
then
i
should
have
but
final
thoughts
halfway
through
drinking
the
glass
i
added
a
lemon
wedge
it
improved
the
taste
a
tad
but
really
doesnt
make
a
difference
to
the
score
this
is
my
first
time
having
a
corona
light
and
it
goes
right
up
there
with
the
blandest
beers
ive
tasted
o
this
is
better
than
cornona
extra
because
light
beers
are
supposed
to
be
light
o
its
in
a
clear
bottle
its
from
mexico
it
is
craptacular
if
youre
gonna
waste
your
time
just
get
the
regular
corona
dont
bother
with
the
light
its
already
light
it
doesnt
need
to
be
lighter
any
lighter
and
its
just
going
to
float
away
o
not
a
great
beer
or
even
a
good
one
i
guess
this
is
best
drunk
if
ever
in
the
hot
sun
at
the
beach
for
hydration
though
i
think
i
would
personally
prefer
water
i
hate
the
clear
glass
bottle
as
im
sure
that
does
not
help
with
the
skunky
notes
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
wasnt
horrible
but
doesnt
have
much
of
a
taste
the
clear
bottle
might
high
have
something
to
do
with
the
skunky
nature
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
grain
corn
flakes
water
and
metal
taste
is
the
same
with
an
emphasis
on
the
watery
quality
this
beer
has
an
extremely
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
horrible
beer
with
no
real
redeeming
qualities
definitely
one
of
the
worst
mexican
beers
i
have
had
so
far
overall
exactly
what
youd
expect
and
frankly
this
beer
is
much
better
with
the
lime
sadly
no
surprise
overall
very
bland
but
not
particularly
offensive
one
of
the
better
light
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
too
insipid
to
hate
bad
beer
lime
needed
just
an
unacceptable
brew
by
almost
every
count
i
say
almost
because
on
cinco
de
mayo
at
1030
in
the
morning
on
a
mild
hangover
when
its
90
degrees
out
and
its
the
only
beer
at
the
party
its
tolerable
in
small
doses
clear
bottle
shows
watery
less
than
yellow
some
chemically
white
bubbles
smells
like
corn
syrup
preservative
and
dead
beer
ugh
flavor
isnt
actually
awful
in
the
context
of
these
adjunct
light
bogus
semibrews
bit
of
malt
balanced
very
light
on
the
mouthfeel
and
sodapop
carbonation
definitely
refreshing
but
it
tastes
so
much
worse
than
even
some
of
the
lowliest
craft
offerings
overall
it
would
take
a
near
miracle
to
get
me
to
drink
one
of
these
again
with
corona
extra
being
one
of
the
lightest
beers
out
who
needs
this
even
weaker
version
yikes
i
like
to
have
six
of
these
waiting
in
the
cooler
after
a
few
hours
of
yard
work
in
the
summer
great
thirst
quenching
beer
the
only
light
beer
i
will
drink
overall
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
very
close
to
water
probably
a
decent
choice
if
youre
trying
to
drink
24
in
one
sitting
while
on
the
beach
i
had
this
at
the
airport
in
cancun
just
before
i
leave
bright
yellow
colour
with
lots
of
bubbles
in
the

a

terrible
2002
lots
of
hate
on
here
for
this
but
compared
to
other
light
beers
i
actually
like
it
its
surprisingly
crisp
and
clean
probably
mostly
water
haha
but
not
bad
if
you
are
driving
not
bad
not
good
somewhere
in
the
middle
a
lot
more
crisp
than
regular
heineken
this
is
a
great
light
beer
and
that
is
why
i
am
giving
it
such
a
high
score
if
you
have
ever
tried
a
lot
of
different
light
beers
then
you
know
this
stuff
is
pretty
friggin
awesome
its
not
much
different
from
an
original
heineken
just
a
tad
bit
lighter
in
taste
i
love
this
beer
because
i
can
cut
the
calories
and
keep
the
taste
slight
skunky
smell
but
typical
of
what
youd
expect
from
heineken
definitely
better
than
the
56
overall
rating
though
tastes
like
slightly
watered
down
heineken
typical
light
beer
but
good
on
a
warm
day
playing
golf
o
not
outstanding
but
one
of
the
better
light
beers
that
i
have
had
not
great
not
much
to
say
someone
left
a
whole
case
of
this
swill
on
my
back
porch
one
day
i
ran
out
of
beer
i
say
beer
cause
heineken
light
is
not
beer
anyway
i
ran
out
of
real
beer
had
to
drink
one
of
these
i
can
not
believe
heineken
sells
this
junk
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
ever
had
tastes
like
water
with
a
3
abv
i
compare
this
to
boxed
wine
its
horrible
no
hope
at
all
no
flavor
at
all
you
might
as
well
drink
carbonated
water
because
heineken
light
is
only
carbonated
water
has
no
flavor
no
alcohol
completely
and
absolutely
the
worst
beer
i
ever
drank
in
my
life
did
the
job
while
not
taking
too
many
calories
from
reg
heinekens
oh
no
no
no
no
watered
down
version
of
the
regular
ok
for
light
beer
but
not
good
funny
story
about
this
one
my
wife
and
i
were
summer
vacationing
in
delaware
im
a
craft
beer
drinker
she
is
not
being
that
it
was
scorching
hot
she
wanted
to
buy
a
12
pack
of
heineken
for
the
week
because
it
was
cheap
i
reluctantly
agreed
she
went
inside
the
store
and
mistakenly
bought
heineken
light
she
must
have
been
in
a
rush
when
we
got
back
home
we
noticed
this
and
drove
back
to
the
liquor
store
to
exchange
it
the
bad
news
was
that
in
delaware
it
is
state
law
that
all
alcohol
purchases
are
non
refundableexchangeable
long
story
short
we
got
stuck
with
heineken
light
all
week
what
else
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
watery
and
devoid
of
flavor
never
again
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
color
is
pale
golden
aroma
is
light
grains
and
grassy
hops
flavor
is
a
weak
grain
and
hop
concoction
that
finishes
clean
mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervescent
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
this
does
suck
quite
a
bit
but
not
as
badly
as
id
thought
it
would
overall
not
as
skunky
as
heineken
not
as
watery
as
the
low
abv
suggests
beer
ingredients
are
masked
by
metallic
notes
surprisingly
disgusting
given
that
this
brewery
does
make
a
number
of
good
lagers
mostly
unavailable
in
the
u
s
this
is
a
quality
light
lager
while
aal
light
lagers
are
very
cheap
and
not
really
good
coors
light
is
the
only
one
ill
drink
this
one
is
just
spectacular
i
can
smell
hops
the
taste
is
really
hoppy
too
and
light
not
really
light
on
flavor
as
it
still
has
plenty
of
hoppy
flavor
and
a
hint
of
malt
dont
know
why
this
is
rated
so
bad
this
honestly
i
have
had
5
with
barbecue
chicken
and
i
am
not
really
drunk
or
full
3
3
abv
makes
this
perfect
for
me
perfect
session
beer
the
reason
i
liked
coors
was
the
fact
it
was
low
in
alcohol
and
didnt
fill
me
up
this
does
the
same
thing
while
retaining
a
good
amount
of
flavor
would
drink
this
a
lot
heineken
light
35
o
light
very
light
but
not
otherwise
flawed
and
not
bad
with
a
meal
note
bottled
heineken
in
the
us
is
oftem
spoiled
so
can
are
recommended
for
the
style
this
beer
is
very
good
it
is
watery
but
what
do
you
expect
for
99
calories
and
3
2
alcohol
this
is
a
light
style
lager
if
you
want
a
stout
or
ipa
then
drink
that
instead
if
you
want
a
low
abv
light
lager
then
this
is
pretty
nice
i
could
drink
this
all
day
when
fishing
out
in
the
hot
sun
if
you
can
get
past
the
wateriness
it
is
a
good
beer
pours
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
1finger
frizzy
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
some
light
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
but
not
much
lots
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
glass
due
to
the
above
average
carbonation
the
aroma
is
close
to
their
regular
heineken
which
is
slightly
skunky
as
is
like
most
brews
in
green
bottles
right
mario
esposito
which
is
of
grains
with
a
hint
of
sweet
corn
not
much
else
the
taste
like
just
like
a
watereddown
heineken
but
actually
not
as
heavilybodied
as
a
regular
heiny
similar
to
the
premium
light
added
cascade
hops
looks
good
tastes
good
not
too
sure
this
is
better
than
the
original
some
minor
but
better
hop
aspect
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
smallish
bone
white
head
that
shows
little
retention
light
sweet
bready
malty
pilsner
aroma
with
a
whole
lot
of
skunk
the
flavor
is
a
light
bready
grainy
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
and
again
a
bit
of
mercaptan
light
body
with
a
spritzy
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
watery
mouthfeel
i
cant
get
away
from
the
skunky
aroma
to
find
much
to
like
about
this
beer
probably
a
poor
example
to
be
a
classic
style
imho
i
actually
like
this
better
than
regular
heineken
its
cleaner
fresher
tasting
more
carbonated
and
less
filling
no
metallic
or
adjuncts
really
either
just
better
still
crap
though
sudsy
white
head
on
yellow
liquid
smell
of
fresh
pils
malts
and
generic
ale
yeast
watery
and
soft
but
not
devoid
of
flavor
malt
forward
balancing
hops
only
a
good
slammer
beer
golf
beer
boat
beer
etc
but
with
very
little
redeeming
qualities
outside
of
these
contexts
good
bubbles
refreshing
when
freezing
and
affordable
enough
it
has
a
role
and
its
better
than
the
other
light
beers
especially
the
imports
i
can
get
behind
this
a
little
bit
also
seems
to
be
handled
better
than
the
regular
which
eliminated
the
skunky
odor
and
taste
i
associate
with
the
parent
beer
here
taste
is
similar
to
other
light
lagers
but
does
have
a
bit
of
fruitiness
that
helps
it
stand
out
also
has
a
hint
of
earthiness
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
high
carbonation
what
you
would
expect
o
a
decent
nonoffensive
light
beer
light
bodied
beer
tastes
like
a
pilsner
that
is
less
bitter
than
average
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
with
a
pleasing
light
carbonated
taste
not
too
much
complex
flavor
but
that
is
how
these
beers
are
has
somewhat
unusual
aftertaste
be
sure
to
get
a
12
pack
so
the
light
doesnt
skunk
the
beer
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
has
some
flavor
to
it
actually
if
i
was
forced
to
drink
a
light
beer
id
probably
go
with
this
one
decent
amount
of
flavor
considering
this
is
actually
lighterhas
less
alcohol
than
most
light
beers
even
if
you
gotta
go
light
this
may
be
one
of
the
better
choices
overall
drank
this
because
it
was
offered
to
me
at
my
best
friends
house
or
i
wouldnt
have
ordered
it
not
a
fan
of
light
beers
and
very
few
have
caught
my
attention
this
definitely
isnt
one
of
them
salud
o
this
was
my
only
choice
at
a
friends
house
today
otherwise
i
may
never
have
drank
this
beer
i
did
not
finish
the
entire
serving
but
it
was
easy
to
read
overall
very
easy
to
drink
on
would
be
great
for
the
summer
o
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
for
a
light
lager
because
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
regular
heineken
but
just
is
a
little
lighterbodied
o
overall
it
was
slightly
better
than
expected
for
the
beer
having
a
light
lable
on
it
realistically
its
just
another
euro
lage
although
far
better
than
a
lot
of
light
and
regular
adjuncts
id
have
again
if
handed
one
overall
lets
move
on
nothing
to
see
here
much
better
out
there
even
in
this
style
for
sure
overall
this
beer
did
not
do
a
lot
for
me
i
bought
the
second
6
because
the
first
were
so
ordinary
that
i
thought
that
they
were
old
it
just
left
me
wanting
more
granted
it
is
a
light
beer
but
there
are
others
out
there
that
do
a
better
job
of
quenching
your
thirst
and
have
more
flavor
well
we
all
know
that
heineken
is
a
good
goto
beer
and
the
heineken
light
is
not
the
exception
this
is
a
good
interpretation
of
a
light
lager
beer
it
remains
with
body
and
taste
even
though
it
is
light
it
is
much
alike
like
its
bigger
brother
the
regular
lager
it
tastes
a
bit
bitter
with
many
hops
but
it
is
very
smooth
at
the
same
time
it
is
very
refreshing
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
overall
a
good
beer
to
drink
while
at
a
picnic
or
bbq
outing
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
with
fizzy
head
doesnt
stick
around
long
smells
like
a
light
beer
tastes
like
a
light
beer
mouthfeel
is
like
water
overall
on
par
with
miller
and
bud
light
dont
think
ill
be
having
any
more
of
this
stuff
any
time
soon
originally
reviewed
10162011
clear
yellow
body
with
an
inch
of
white
head
that
settles
slowly
some
patchy
lacing
looks
ok
for
a
light
beer
nose
and
taste
are
both
super
skunky
sharp
and
pungent
with
some
grainy
malt
and
a
hint
of
flowery
hops
underneath
some
adjunct
taste
of
cereal
grains
or
rice
perhaps
but
its
that
classic
green
bottle
heinie
skunk
all
the
way
that
dominates
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
super
drinkable
if
you
like
drinking
skunk
flavored
watery
beverages
something
about
the
skunkiness
ignites
a
wave
of
nostalgia
in
me
bringing
me
back
to
my
youthful
experiences
with
lousy
euro
lagers
so
i
dont
hate
this
as
much
as
most
but
i
still
wouldnt
buy
it
or
drink
it
again
on
offer
at
a
barbeque
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
still
not
the
worst
of
the
worst
o
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
or
a
particular
beer
that
i
want
to
come
back
and
have
again
overall
it
is
very
much
a
watereddown
version
of
heineken
nothing
too
spectacular
smells
almost
putrid
but
hey
it
levels
off
after
that
becoming
inoffensive
mostly
and
well
light
good
i
suppose
if
you
cant
get
a
glass
of
water
to
go
with
your
real
beer
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
easily
it
goes
down
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
brew
with
mild
flavoring
this
is
something
you
might
be
interested
in
the
beer
lacks
any
real
flavoring
but
comes
forth
with
basic
malts
and
a
light
airy
background
it
is
not
as
offensive
as
many
others
like
it
but
is
also
not
something
i
would
regularly
stock
in
my
fridge
this
lacks
flavor
its
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
musty
and
forgettable
ill
pass
in
the
future
o
this
is
about
as
bad
a
beer
as
ive
ever
had
i
left
some
room
in
the
rankings
for
something
truly
awful
but
dont
let
that
fool
you
youre
better
off
drinking
almost
anything
other
than
this
o
im
really
not
impressed
with
this
light
lager
i
think
this
may
be
a
style
that
i
should
just
avoid
in
the
future
as
it
has
no
appeal
to
me
pours
a
very
pale
clear
yellow
that
has
a
fast
disappearing
head
even
if
you
pour
the
beer
way
too
quickly
scent
is
that
cheap
grains
which
are
musty
to
my
nose
taste
is
weak
very
weak
this
is
barely
a
step
up
from
water
this
is
basically
water
with
a
hint
of
beer
it
amazes
me
how
this
stuff
even
sells
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
it
should
be
ok
for
minors
to
buy
due
to
its
weakness
im
glad
it
was
free
because
at
full
price
12
was
12
too
much
taste
is
light
pilsener
nothing
special
pretty
bubbly
mostly
like
flavored
water
very
light
on
the
mouth
overall
a
fairly
averagebelow
average
light
beer
overall
i
am
not
a
light
beer
drinker
this
is
what
was
offered
i
did
not
particularly
enjoy
this
but
a
light
beer
is
a
light
beer
no
damage
done
id
certainly
reach
for
this
beer
over
the
mainstream
light
beers
take
heineken
6
pack
add
equal
parts
water
to
the
beer
voila
12
pack
of
heinecken
light
beer
pours
a
clear
and
very
yellow
looks
like
light
beer
about
a
finger
worth
of
head
after
a
hard
pour
that
dissipated
very
quickly
no
lacing
smell
was
grainy
and
skunky
not
much
good
here
smells
like
euro
light
beer
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
corny
and
grainy
but
oddly
the
shunkiness
is
not
here
tastes
like
average
euro
light
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
nor
as
carbonated
as
i
was
expecting
pretty
average
overall
it
is
not
the
worst
euro
light
ive
ever
had
but
not
worth
running
after
decent
over
as
light
beer
beer
goes
this
is
okay
which
is
not
saying
much
at
all
it
doesnt
trigger
the
gag
reflex
or
anything
but
i
cant
think
of
a
good
enough
reason
for
ever
drinking
it
again
i
hope
that
keg
was
old
because
if
it
was
fresh
then
may
god
have
mercy
on
the
brewers
who
made
this
garbage
i
believe
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
ever
had
that
i
simply
could
not
finish
nor
find
anything
positive
about
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
not
good
but
its
not
offensive
either
ive
had
worse
o
not
a
light
lager
that
i
would
reach
for
lacks
in
taste
and
the
skunk
flavor
is
too
overpowering
this
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
actually
a
larger
head
the
smell
can
only
be
described
as
a
skunk
spraying
just
horrible
the
taste
is
light
a
tad
matly
just
a
little
bit
of
a
skunk
flavor
it
actually
isnt
too
difficult
to
drink
and
its
a
bit
heavier
for
a
light
beer
overall
for
a
light
beer
this
so
far
takes
the
cake
much
better
then
other
light
lagers
i
could
actually
go
for
another
part
of
an
elite
group
of
beers
that
might
actually
make
me
quit
drinking
beers
poured
a
2
head
which
recedes
medium
quick
clear
light
straw
yellow
in
color
smells
with
hints
of
skunking
and
wee
little
grass
and
malt
taste
is
watery
but
a
touch
sweet
and
a
hint
of
malt
finish
is
light
and
disappears
fast
so
folks
why
is
this
such
a
huge
seller
its
because
its
so
watery
and
inoffensive
youd
give
it
to
your
children
were
it
not
for
having
alcohol
content
as
an
avid
homebrewer
and
drinker
of
many
types
of
beer
i
can
honestly
say
that
for
a
light
beer
i
find
this
to
be
very
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
barbecuing
in
the
backyard
i
never
was
a
big
fan
of
heineken
unless
i
was
getting
them
for
50
cents
a
bottle
in
las
vegas
but
i
must
say
that
i
can
easily
put
a
few
of
these
down
this
is
a
decent
light
beer
and
cost
me
6
496
at
total
wine
im
about
to
go
get
another
one
after
writing
this
review
i
guess
the
key
word
here
is
refreshing
it
all
comes
down
to
what
you
are
in
the
mood
for
if
youre
having
some
company
over
for
the
day
go
out
and
buy
a
case
or
two
of
this
brew
and
drop
it
in
a
large
bucket
of
ice
im
sure
nobody
will
complain
overall
i
have
nothing
against
light
beers
but
this
one
really
does
taste
like
water
refreshing
yes
but
not
what
i
am
going
to
go
for
when
i
want
a
beer
still
sadly
better
then
the
original
version
rjt
o
my
friend
from
the
netherlands
would
be
pissed
to
see
this
review
but
thankfully
hes
not
on
ba
seriously
though
miller
64
has
more
flavor
than
this
i
could
put
these
down
before
during
and
after
a
marathon
you
could
also
use
this
to
hydrate
after
a
long
day
of
drinking
or
mask
your
scent
while
hunting
i
will
hand
it
to
heineken
though
they
do
a
fantastic
job
on
marketing
and
design
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
some
carbonation
little
fizzy
white
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
grainyricy
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
light
body
again
another
lame
attempt
for
a
beer
what
a
waste
of
a
bottle
this
brew
was
one
of
my
early
beers
i
had
i
actually
stole
a
bottom
from
a
friends
parents
fridge
hoping
they
wouldnt
notice
as
far
as
i
know
they
never
noticed
anyway
the
beer
was
decent
at
the
time
but
since
then
ive
had
much
better
the
beer
looks
much
like
regular
heineken
and
smells
the
too
the
taste
is
just
a
little
more
watered
down
d
fairly
drinkable
and
not
offensive
in
any
way
as
a
direct
comparison
i
much
preferred
the
now
defunct
rock
green
light
pours
almost
clear
piss
coloured
yellow
hints
lots
of
carbonation
but
very
little
head
served
ice
cold
smells
like
nothing
maybe
a
touch
of
some
malts
but
really
not
much
tastes
like
water
with
some
light
maltiness
but
not
much
okay
mouthfeel
overly
carbonated
for
my
tastes
but
fairly
drinkable
as
a
light
lager
this
is
a
good
dollar
beer
night
beer
couldnt
wait
to
get
home
and
get
something
hoppy
with
a
little
flavor
to
it
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
light
pilsner
malt
and
german
hop
scent
its
light
and
watered
down
like
a
weaker
version
of
the
original
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
has
a
light
pilsner
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
dry
finish
its
easy
drinking
and
attractive
to
people
who
like
light
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
average
light
lager
its
quaffable
yet
devoid
of
much
malt
character
d
i
cant
drink
it
at
all
poured
it
down
the
drain
taste
is
also
very
bland
dry
and
boring
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
dry
its
easy
drinking
for
a
buzz
but
not
a
good
beer
at
all
its
got
such
a
low
abv
though
its
hardly
even
worth
drinking
d
this
is
a
great
brew
to
drink
if
you
are
looking
to
pound
a
case
and
have
to
use
the
bathroom
every
other
beer
other
wise
for
this
light
lager
style
there
are
many
domestic
and
imports
that
rise
high
above
i
like
this
better
than
other
light
beers
but
ultimately
i
could
still
only
drink
one
of
these
this
is
one
of
the
few
light
beers
that
i
will
actually
drink
the
beer
is
very
very
clear
in
color
almost
colorless
the
smell
is
light
and
sweet
there
is
practically
zero
head
when
i
poured
into
a
glass
it
is
however
very
refreshing
and
great
for
social
getherings
serve
well
chilled
as
the
colder
this
ber
is
the
better
it
is
pours
straw
out
of
a
keg
with
a
thin
bright
white
head
aroma
is
of
grass
and
a
little
cereal
palate
is
extremely
thin
and
watery
taste
is
non
existent
it
was
the
only
beer
available
at
my
friends
birthday
party
i
poured
out
the
glass
into
the
sink
after
the
first
sip
do
not
try
it
at
home
im
not
going
to
spend
more
characters
than
i
have
to
describing
a
very
average
very
clean
refreshing
enough
light
beer
with
a
touch
of
hop
flavor
grainy
watery
decent
carbonation
a
hop
or
two
overall
boringly
inoffensive
deserves
a
better
score
than
most
people
are
giving
it
good
three
finger
head
of
soap
suds
like
bubbles
but
the
color
is
very
light
a
3
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
lace
is
thick
and
clinging
faint
smell
of
straw
and
wet
wheat
flavor
is
light
and
very
bland
not
much
taste
here
at
all
maybe
a
little
corn
flavor
much
like
water
with
a
little
fizz
in
my
mouth
not
worth
the
price
in
fact
i
would
not
take
one
if
it
was
available
with
other
free
beer
d
ok
it
is
not
the
worst
euro
light
ive
ever
had
but
not
worth
running
after
decent
not
the
worst
but
among
them
taste
is
skunk
feel
is
skunk
theres
quite
the
theme
here
theres
some
prickly
carbonation
that
thankfully
carries
much
of
the
flavor
away
some
slight
grain
but
not
all
that
much
this
is
a
bad
beer
theres
not
that
much
going
on
but
what
is
there
i
really
dont
like
a
super
wimpy
beer
pours
a
thin
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
a
tiny
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
grain
and
corn
and
a
little
malt
tastes
like
grain
and
corn
and
a
little
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
drinkability
is
decent
it
is
a
wussy
beer
never
had
heineken
light
until
now
everyones
reviews
were
spot
on
so
i
wont
waste
my
time
typing
something
that
doesnt
deserve
a
critical
review
and
at
3
abv
i
feel
like
im
drinking
skunk
smelling
water
basically
i
drank
it
to
add
it
to
my
bottle
collection
and
the
remaining
will
be
used
for
beer
pong
when
the
buddies
come
over
fairly
generic
lager
there
isnt
anything
special
about
the
pour
looks
golden
and
fairly
clear
i
cannot
discern
anything
from
the
smell
of
the
beer
you
couldnt
tell
it
was
beer
the
taste
is
actually
not
terrbile
granted
there
isnt
much
there
but
ive
had
much
worse
mouthfeel
is
typical
for
the
style
some
carbonation
but
generally
smooth
since
the
abv
is
so
low
it
is
drinkable
and
not
the
worst
choice
you
could
make
id
choose
something
with
more
flavor
even
as
a
light
lager
i
find
it
humorous
that
this
is
getting
slammed
but
for
a
light
lager
it
does
ok
it
still
retains
a
good
bit
of
flavor
this
was
a
typical
golf
course
beer
that
we
had
after
shooting
18
and
it
was
decent
and
if
it
was
between
this
and
the
massive
amounts
of
budweiser
i
would
take
this
hands
down
final
thoughts
i
poured
this
thing
down
the
drain
after
half
a
glass
avoid
this
beer
unless
you
are
offered
one
at
a
party
and
dont
want
to
seem
rude
pretty
good
for
a
lighter
beer
i
think
it
is
a
little
too
heavily
carbonated
and
seems
a
little
like
an
alcoholic
sprite
the
carbonation
definitely
overrides
any
truly
distinctive
flavor
in
the
beer
despite
this
i
do
think
heineken
is
more
refreshing
than
most
beers
and
i
never
turn
one
down
overall
i
will
pass
while
it
is
not
as
horrible
tasting
as
some
of
the
others
its
blandness
does
me
in
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
straight
skunk
i
know
this
is
not
how
the
brewer
intended
the
beer
to
smell
but
when
you
choose
a
light
green
bottle
for
your
beer
you
should
be
held
responsible
if
it
skunks
the
flavor
is
not
as
skunky
and
has
notes
of
corn
and
grass
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
its
closer
to
water
than
it
is
to
beer
as
a
light
beer
its
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
choose
it
over
other
cheaper
light
beers
but
i
could
easily
finish
6
better
than
an
american
light
beer
maybe
but
still
not
one
id
want
to
try
again
my
pour
produced
a
fingerandahalf
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
light
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
slightly
sulfuric
underlain
by
a
slight
lager
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
a
real
drawback
of
the
style
it
had
a
light
lager
seetness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
mild
and
unobtrusive
it
really
begets
the
question
why
it
was
inoffensive
but
it
was
also
pretty
tasteless
and
bland
why
bother
drinkability
its
drinkability
really
depends
on
your
tastes
if
you
just
finished
mowing
the
lawn
and
discovered
your
sink
is
broken
this
serves
as
an
acceptable
substitute
for
water
if
your
goal
is
to
get
drunk
without
ingesting
too
many
calories
or
without
tasting
what
goes
into
your
mouth
this
serves
as
an
ideal
beer
if
however
your
goal
is
to
explore
and
enjoy
a
delicious
beer
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
d
drinkable
i
could
see
anyone
having
maybe
a
six
pack
of
this
in
a
couple
hours
nothing
really
could
hold
one
back
from
drinking
a
lot
of
these
because
the
alcohol
content
is
low
it
is
worth
drinking
if
only
to
understand
how
far
beer
has
come
ultimately
this
is
a
good
beer
to
use
for
cooking
fondue
beer
bread
etc
but
avoid
drinking
this
is
you
have
other
options
drinkability
it
is
very
drinkable
because
it
has
little
flavoring
to
it
and
is
not
that
expensive
overall
i
dont
know
why
you
would
bother
picking
this
over
regular
heineken
which
is
pretty
tame
to
begin
with
unfortunately
this
beer
is
not
even
as
good
as
heineken
very
watery
and
boring
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
with
so
many
other
great
craft
offerings
that
are
light
and
easy
to
drink
as
well
this
one
will
not
even
be
on
my
radar
any
more
pours
an
almost
clear
straw
yellow
with
lots
of
fizz
activity
rising
to
the
top
and
immediately
dissipating
not
any
head
to
speak
of
other
than
a
very
thin
ring
of
white
bubble
clusters
around
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
smells
rather
bourgeois
with
just
enough
malt
to
be
described
as
a
beer
taste
is
even
less
so
almost
tastes
like
beer
flavored
soda
water
mouthfeel
is
about
the
same
it
is
rather
drinkable
because
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
any
of
its
components
picked
up
one
of
the
5
liter
minikegs
for
the
champions
league
game
today
all
hail
lionel
messi
poured
from
the
mini
keg
into
a
nice
tall
german
glass
very
golden
in
color
like
jewelry
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
light
lace
nose
is
slightly
maltygrainy
and
thats
it
but
better
than
some
light
beers
i
have
had
taste
is
also
a
bit
malty
and
better
flavored
than
many
light
beers
i
have
had
mouthfeel
is
light
but
creamy
with
appropriate
carbonation
a
coat
of
light
malt
stays
on
the
tongue
sessionable
with
a
good
price
one
of
the
better
light
beers
i
have
had
just
another
lager
for
the
masses
once
poured
in
my
bayern
pilsener
glass
look
golden
glass
crystal
color
creamy
foamy

lenght
never
had
a
light

with
good

sweet

and
herbal
hops
taste
sweet
grains
again
cereal
and
spring
water
the
ingredients
from
the
smell
disappear
mouthfeel
watery
slightly
bitter
very
soft
body
and
medium
carbonation
drinkability
a
like
beer
that
liked
the
smell
but
with
nothing
more
to
highlight
because
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
doesns
impress
i
will
make
this
short
and
sweet
this
beer
is
skunky
and
bland
you
can
not
use
green
bottles
and
expect
the
beer
not
to
have
that
skunky
taste
it
smells
aweful
to
boot
on
top
of
all
of
this
it
is
only
3
30
which
is
total
suck
i
went
to
amsterdam
and
i
do
not
recall
the
dutch
actually
drinking
this
beer
if
you
want
to
step
away
from
the
super
shwag
such
as
budweiser
and
miller
and
take
it
to
that
next
level
skip
this
and
try
something
from
samuel
adams
flying
fish
or
long
trail
heineken
brings
the
suck
overall
heineken
light
is
hard
for
me
to
rate
because
it
certainly
isnt
terrible
considering
it
is
a
light
lager
but
it
isnt
good
either
although
i
may
not
have
encountered
many
im
sure
the
light
lager
could
be
done
better
with
that
said
this
beer
tastes
a
bit
like
real
beer
and
wasnt
too
offensive
taste
bland
and
unoffensive
what
most
consumers
look
for
in
light
beers
tiniest
hint
of
hop
spice
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
substance
to
this
beer
notes
it
lacked
the
skunked
flavor
of
a
green
bottle
but
maybe
thats
a
bad
thing
atleast
that
way
it
has
some
flavor
this
literally
tastes
like
water
with
some
increased
taste
it
wouldnt
be
bad
but
sadly
even
amstel
light
beats
this
poured
from
a
green
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
some
malts
taste
is
crisp
malts
and
slightly
sweet
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
selection
at
all
as
far
as
light
beers
go
i
can
barely
drink
regular
heineken
let
alone
heineken
light
its
basically
flavored
water
and
yellow
die
in
a
bottle
also
due
to
its
light
colored
green
bottle
you
tend
to
get
one
that
is
skunked
at
least
once
a
day
at
the
bar
there
is
no
good
smell
to
it
and
it
tends
to
make
you
sick
if
you
try
to
put
them
down
to
quickly
i
personally
suggest
that
you
steer
clear
of
this
beer
if
you
can
my
roommate
picked
it
up
and
ive
had
it
before
but
i
figured
might
as
well
review
it
there
are
some
macros
i
can
still
drink
heineken
is
one
heineken
light
is
not
mostly
theres
no
point
3
3
its
like
skunky
carbonated
water
yeah
its
drinkable
but
why
would
you
want
to
drink
it
its
honestly
not
worth
the
price
in
comparison
to
a
macromicro
that
actually
brings
something
to
the
table
d
of
course
its
drinkable
meaning
you
could
slam
a
lot
of
these
but
really
would
you
want
to
and
anyway
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
to
slam
down
why
pay
extra
for
an
import
bud
light
comes
in
24packs
at
a
much
cheaper
price
d
i
could
drink
100
of
these
easy
but
i
wouldnt
enjoy
it
experience
is
about
1
degree
above
water
from
the
1
pt
8
fl
oz
bottle
with
a
number
on
the
back
that
reads
911952850001
sampled
on
september
6
2009
the
pour
is
golden
yellow
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
fizzles
down
to
nothing
quickly
green
light
struck
bottle
aroma
overpowers
the
weak
scents
of
barley
and
hops
thin
mouthfeel
the
taste
has
a
mixture
of
weak
hops
and
malts
but
nothing
great
drinkability
provided
you
have
your
lil
heart
set
on
purchasing
heineken
light
to
ensure
you
circumvent
the
euroskunk
buying
this
in
a
can
is
really
the
only
way
to
go
pours
a
straw
light
yellow
color
the
smell
is
of
really
nothiness
and
some
rice
or
corn
grains
the
taste
is
of
corn
and
rice
grains
the
taste
is
very
light
and
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
overall
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
however
it
is
very
close
to
being
too
watery
and
you
would
get
bored
very
very
quick
d
it
is
very
drinkable
for
what
it
is
very
light
crisp
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
just
wouldnt
drink
this
for
the
taste
this
is
carbonated
water
masquerading
as
a
beer
i
think
perrier
has
more
malt
flavor
than
this
i
hope
this
does
not
have
more
than
10
calories
no
flavor
barely
any
alcohol
whats
the
point
its
like
going
to
a
strip
club
where
they
all
have
to
wear
those
little
pasties
over
the
nipples
bad
bad
bad
beer
among
light
beers
this
is
no
worse
than
average
and
perhaps
a
bit
better
but
then
this
is
a
low
standard
to
start
with
overall
the
flavor
profile
seemed
true
to
the
standard
heineken
lager
only
watereddown
i
suspect
you
could
achieve
the
same
effect
by
letting
a
couple
of
ice
cubes
melt
in
a
glass
of
heineken
neither
offensive
nor
enjoyable
just
wet
d
never
again
at
least
not
from
this
ripoff
delivery
system
its
drinkable
smooth
and
crisp
i
think
thats
what
the
brewers
were
going
for
drinkability
takes
a
severe
hit
with
the
smell
and
taste
being
rank
but
im
sure
brewery
fresh
and
cold
as
hell
wouldnt
be
oh
so
bad
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
excuse
me
its
watery
the
carbonation
is
active
but
not
stinging
this
beer
is
a
throw
back
beer
but
not
in
a
good
way
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
ok
people
read
the
label
this
is
a
light
beer
would
you
complain
of
a
double
ipa
not
having
enough
malt
would
you
downgrade
a
wheat
beer
for
not
using
enough
hops
of
all
the
light
beers
out
there
this
is
one
of
the
best
although
i
rarely
drink
light
beers
i
think
its
only
fair
to
judge
them
for
what
they
are
this
tastes
pretty
much
like
regular
heineken
but
with
less
taste
big
surprise
but
its
very
drinkable
and
has
a
lot
more
taste
than
most
light
beers
other
than
maybe
sam
adams
light
and
amstel
light
for
a
99
calorie
beer
i
think
its
very
well
done
d
id
rather
drink
something
else
thats
light
rather
than
this
one
it
just
didnt
spark
with
me
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
a
lot
light
any
light
beer
with
its
easy
drinking
but
light
on
the
flavor
that
is
a
great
beer
if
light
beer
is
what
youre
into
then
this
would
be
a
good
choice
d
not
really
i
finished
my
can
because
i
was
parched
and
needed
some
liquid
but
i
would
not
willingly
buy
this
for
myself
or
bring
it
to
a
party
i
need
to
try
a
heineken
in
amsterdam
to
see
if
there
is
a
difference
because
i
get
the
feeling
they
just
send
the
u
s
the
dregs
of
the
heineken
lineup
well
it
has
one
saving
quality
its
pretty
easy
going
down
that
is
about
all
that
makes
this
beer
still
exist
it
smells
and
tastes
like
a
skunky
nightmare
this
is
the
antithesis
of
a
good
beer
a
very
subtle
malt
and
hop
character
but
honestly
i
dont
get
anything
from
this
beer
i
wonder
who
goes
out
and
purchases
this
beer
to
keep
in
their
home
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
their
friend
and
you
shouldnt
either
it
is
really
heineken
light
and
i
mean
heineken
is
light
and
terrible
to
begin
with
why
make
it
worse
this
is
the
most
terrible
eurotrash
macro
i
have
come
across
a
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
headlots
of
carbonation
aroma
of
light
floral
hopscornskunk
weed
flavor
is
very
lightsome
corn
a
dash
of
that
skunksome
sweetnessrice
maybe
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
and
finishdrinkable
but
nothing
special
in
any
way
d
obviously
made
to
be
a
session
beer
that
is
supposed
to
be
a
quality
light
lager
it
is
what
it
is
like
most
people
on
here
i
would
prefer
to
be
drinking
something
more
refined
or
whatnot
but
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
light
lager
for
what
its
going
for
cant
complain
this
light
beer
pours
a
faint
shade
of
yellow
is
crystal
clear
and
has
only
a
bit
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
down
to
a
thin
ring
nose
is
ricey
low
on
any
malt
aroma
and
only
slightly
hinting
at
hops
taste
is
disappointing
in
comparison
to
regular
heineken
and
they
can
officially
drop
the
term
premium
unfortunately
the
taste
buts
this
beer
down
with
the
macro
light
beers
and
this
beer
has
an
unusual
offtaste
that
reminds
me
of
stale
burnt
rice
body
is
well
light
and
the
carbonation
is
good
but
overall
i
would
not
drink
this
beer
again
d
this
actually
tasted
like
a
lighter
version
of
regular
heineken
for
a
light
lager
it
wasnt
too
bad
again
this
has
slid
a
long
way
in
my
book
but
still
a
beer
i
can
enjoy
when
none
of
the
good
stuff
is
available
one
of
the
most
bland
beers
ive
ever
had
this
is
not
what
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
its
a
shame
that
so
many
think
it
is
this
is
headache
material
and
hardly
merits
scrutiny
time
to
invite
some
macro
fans
over
to
finish
it
off
im
a
fan
of
the
regular
heineken
and
i
gotta
say
this
brew
let
me
down
pale
color
and
a
quickly
dissipating
head
set
this
beer
off
to
a
bad
start
and
the
smell
is
nothing
spectacular
had
about
three
of
these
before
i
gave
the
rest
away
better
luck
just
sticking
to
the
real
thing
here
wont
be
buying
another
case
of
this
brew
any
time
soon

i
like
the
taste
more
than
expected
but
to
low
on
abv
to
make
it
worth
it
for
me
to
pursue
lighter
in
taste
oy
thats
a
marketing
ploy
head
settles
to
a
pencilthin
mustache
ulike
the
lager
pingish
aroma
eysbut
softer
more
subtle
tha
the
original
actually
a
benefit
when
considering
it
offensive
effect
a
softer
less
aggressive
action
early
with
the
same
faux
finish
late
again
actually
more
beneficial
to
the
drinker
a
bit
more
straight
in
its
flavor
profile
with
nothing
out
of
line
even
less
on
the
offensive
than
the
original
thins
to
water
at
the
finish
how
to
spin
this
politely
at
a
hot
summer
party
this
beer
would
work
i
still
wouldnt
want
it
though
no
much
going
on
nuttin
really
offensive
either
this
could
make
for
a
lawnmower
session
beer
but
thats
about
it
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
lack
of
taste
and
whatever
taste
is
there
is
bad
stay
away
from
this
one
1
55
skunky
heineken
aroma
yellow
beer
fizzy
head
same
sweet
ricemalt
flavor
with
some
saaz
flavors
i
gave
this
a
2
5
in
the
flavor
department
because
this
is
possibly
the
only
light
beer
that
tastes
just
like
its
big
brother
so
its
got
that
going
for
it
i
saw
a
bumper
sticker
here
in
marin
that
said
dont
eat
yellow
snow
dont
drink
yellow
beer
words
to
live
by
this
heineken
light
out
of
the
bottle
poured
an
unimpressive
light
yellow
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
of
a
slight
graininess
and
maybe
some
hops
but
not
a
lot
the
usual
green
bottle
skunky
aroma
was
also
in
effect
taste
wise
there
was
nothing
redeemable
about
this
beer
my
first
impression
was
of
a
grainy
wet
cardboard
taste
but
not
in
a
good
way
the
beer
did
end
rather
dry
without
much
fuss
though
drinkability
wise
while
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
i
would
wonder
why
anyone
would
want
to
this
is
the
light
version
of
their
famous
flagship
beer
out
of
a
bottle
it
was
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
the
aroma
was
standard
macro
lager
with
some
metallic
hints
and
a
little
mustiness
the
flavors
were
similar
with
a
strong
aftertaste
of
corn
mash
the
body
was
light
and
watery
with
an
overcarbonated
mouthfeel
basically
this
one
just
sucked
on
each
level
its
one
saving
grace
is
that
it
is
in
fact
easy
to
drink
as
lights
tend
to
be
but
why
you
would
have
one
let
alone
multiples
i
dont
know
drinkability
very
easy
and
smooth
when
you
need
a
light
try
this
drinkability
is
bad
i
will
never
try
this
or
anything
with
the
heineken
label
again
d
drinkability
was
better
then
expected
and
had
no
problem
finishing
honestly
not
that
bad
overall
and
certainly
didnt
come
off
as
a
light
beer
not
really
unpleasant
heineken
light
is
just
not
that
tasty
it
is
a
good
example
of
a
diet
beer
and
has
only
a
shadow
of
the
flavor
and
drinkability
of
heineken
dnot
a
bad
brew
as
there
are
no
real
off
flavours
but
really
not
much
going
on
here
i
would
rather
have
a
mild
or
a
bitter
ill
only
drink
this
when
i
have
too
and
again
to
me
its
a
better
choice
than
bud
coors
light
drink
well
its
kinda
like
beer
soda
pardon
me
its
just
like
beer
soda
i
could
and
actually
have
pound
a
twelver
in
34
hours
which
is
what
you
have
to
do
to
catch
a
buzz
i
believe
im
done
with
this
stuff
in
a
nutshell
this
is
nothing
more
than
watered
down
heineken
aroma
is
an
extremely
weak
version
of
the
regular
appearance
is
similar
except
slightly
more
pale
with
horrible
carbonation
and
no
head
or
lacing
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
flavor
is
closer
to
water
than
beer
there
is
a
trace
of
the
trademark
euro
lager
flavor
but
very
weak
i
knew
this
would
be
a
bad
beer
but
not
this
bad
i
really
like
heineken
but
this
is
sad
this
is
a
decent
macro
if
i
am
at
a
bar
and
i
want
to
pound
something
id
prefer
this
beer
to
bud
light
it
has
a
decent
aroma
compared
to
heineken
it
has
a
pale
yellow
color
good
flavor
for
a
macro
light
beer
its
drinkability
is
comparable
to
water
a
good
beer
for
getting
wasted
on
d
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
it
if
it
has
to
be
heineken
i
drink
make
it
a
regular
please
d
honestly
i
have
no
problems
drinking
this
and
id
probably
take
this
over
heineken
regular
but
to
the
beer
fan
there
is
really
nothing
in
terms
of
flavour
profile
to
make
me
come
back
good
for
what
it
is
but
im
not
going
to
buy
this
again
with
the
multitude
of
brews
on
the
market
in
socal
another
massproduced
light
beer
dud
just
as
perfection
is
a
rarity
here
a
complete
failure
is
tough
to
achieve
too
if
you
can
find
flavor
here
you
can
swallow
it
down
not
horrific
but
close
overall
hard
to
get
past
the
skunkiness
not
impressed
they
were
giving
away
samples
at
some
bar
naturally
the
sample
giver
was
a
hot
chick
to
promote
their
heiney
lite
special
ive
shouldve
known
this
beer
would
suck
when
the
in
crowd
said
it
was
great
very
light
clearish
yellow
body
with
little
head
a
grassy
medicinal
and
very
weak
aroma
passes
for
the
smell
not
much
of
anything
in
the
taste
except
some
minor
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
to
let
you
know
youre
drinking
a
beer
not
a
diet
soda
then
again
soda
has
actual
flavor
in
it
very
slick
and
watery
with
no
drinkability
if
its
carbs
and
fat
grams
youre
watching
save
the
import
price
money
and
get
a
mich
ultra
d
not
flavorful
at
all
goes
down
easily
because
of
the
lack
of
substance
not
filling
at
all
no
kick
there
are
a
lot
of
better
light
beers
out
there
drinkability
this
is
pretty
bland
even
by
macrolight
standards
not
worth
paying
a
premium
for
this
premium
like
most
beers
in
this
category
heineken
does
a
better
job
on
marketing
than
brewing
this
is
a
superlight
weight
coming
in
at
just
one
tenth
above
gas
station
beer
not
much
of
an
aroma
some
bitter
hops
and
grainy
yeasts
as
well
the
taste
is
no
different
watery
body
and
soda
pop
like
carbonation
i
cant
beleive
what
this
sells
for
at
the
store
not
as
overcarbonated
as
lots
of
macro
beers
tend
to
be
drinkable
as
far
as
the
palate
but
not
desirable
in
any
way
tasted
1608
this
tastes
a
lot
litke
the
regular
just
less
of
it
appearance
pale
yellow
in
color
with
one
finger
head
that
disapeared
very
quickly
smell
not
much
faint
hop
thats
about
it
taste
very
watery
way
a
little
hop
presence
in
the
finish
and
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
skunky
mouthfeel
very
thin
with
high
carbonation
drinkability
if
you
have
no
other
choice
avoid
if
im
in
need
of
a
thirst
quenching
and
nothing
else
ill
stick
with
water
or
iced
tea
if
my
thirst
quenching
has
to
be
beer
i
will
look
for
a
witbier
or
a
hefe
if
im
looking
to
keep
weight
off
i
will
moderate
the
amount
of
beer
i
drink
but
stick
to
real
beer
there
seems
to
be
no
real
point
to
consuming
this
very
light
yellow
with
a
quick
fading
bright
white
head
smell
is
of
light
watery
malt
fairly
thin
with
a
corn
like
taste
as
well
very
little
taste
and
aftertaste
but
this
is
what
you
expect
of
a
light
beer
and
overall
besides
being
watered
down
the
flavor
is
perhaps
better
than
regular
heineken
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
alot
of
skunkiness
to
the
nose
that
and
water
thats
about
it
it
really
doenst
even
look
like
beer
but
the
skunkiness
is
profound
enough
to
tell
otherwise
the
taste
or
lack
there
of
is
basically
water
water
water
then
followed
by
a
little
alcohol
and
skunkiness
then
more
water
mouthfeel
is
weak
the
drinkability
is
highest
part
about
this
beer
oddly
only
cause
it
is
so
weak
of
a
beer
i
could
probably
dominate
40
of
these
before
i
feel
it
scary
thought
this
beer
is
just
watered
down
heineken
i
wouldnt
even
use
this
for
cooking
or
beer
batter
get
real
heineken
or
a
stella
instead
dont
fall
for
the
marketing
jive
wow
this
beer
is
terrible
poured
into
a
sam
adams
pint
glass
it
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
only
a
slight
fading
head
there
is
almost
no
smell
or
taste
a
very
slight
corny
taste
with
a
touch
of
skunky
pilsnerlike
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
much
like
an
american
macro
lager
but
a
bit
wimpy
i
cant
believe
someone
left
5
of
these
in
my
fridge
this
beer
for
me
was
essentially
heineken
with
less
a
bit
less
taste
very
light
on
the
color
and
aroma
color
was
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
faint
hint
of
hops
in
the
aroma
the
body
was
weak
typical
of
heineken
and
the
light
had
even
less
of
a
finish
to
it
on
the
positive
note
i
think
this
was
pretty
close
taste
wise
for
me
to
full
out
heineken
so
if
they
were
going
for
that
they
got
it
right
so
if
you
like
heineken
but
for
some
reason
crave
a
light
beer
experience
this
should
work
for
you
hazy
very
light
straw
color
head
reduces
but
hangs
around
a
little
while
not
much
smell
what
i
detect
is
wet
cardboard
taste
is
like
taking
one
part
macro
lager
and
adding
5
parts
or
so
mineral
water
nothing
to
detect
really
it
was
free
never
had
this
before
and
never
will
again
there
is
however
no
skunkiness
or
sulfur
to
deal
with
if
it
mattered
that
would
be
a
good
thing
its
actually
very
drinkable
in
fact
if
i
was
really
thirsty
i
would
happily
drop
one
of
these
in
a
few
big
gulps
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
and
small
skunky
malt
in
the
taste
small
sweet
malt
but
quite
bland
a
small
bite
but
mostly
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
small
dry
aftertaste
kind
of
skunky
but
a
clean
small
sweet
malt
this
is
one
overhyped
beer
it
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
short
white
head
that
is
pretty
thin
it
smells
really
faint
nothing
to
it
really
it
has
an
aroma
of
some
light
malt
and
maybe
some
hops
but
i
cant
detect
anything
else
it
tastes
the
same
light
in
taste
of
light
grains
and
some
hops
but
not
much
of
either
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
though
and
it
is
pretty
drinkable
as
it
is
pretty
low
in
alcohol
content
and
taste
not
really
a
good
beer
and
i
would
not
recommend
it
at
all
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
have
never
really
liked
heineken
too
much
a
little
too
many
hops
and
skunky
taste
for
me
however
heineken
light
has
that
great
smoothness
and
mouthfeel
of
heineken
without
the
skunk
taste
i
definitely
hitthis
drink
up
at
any
heineken
event
from
now
on
when
i
first
drank
this
beer
i
went
in
expecting
it
to
taste
absolutely
horrible
well
half
right
i
dont
really
like
heineken
to
begin
with
hence
it
was
not
a
stretch
to
really
care
too
much
about
this
beer
either
however
if
you
like
this
beer
then
you
might
actually
like
it
if
fizzy
light
beer
is
your
thing
this
is
actually
not
a
bad
choice
okay
i
have
to
admit
i
do
like
the
commercials
but
the
beer
on
the
other
hand
exactly
what
youd
expect
not
much
of
anything
eerily
similar
to
that
becks
premier
light
light
and
fizzy
no
smell
damn
near
no
taste
either
just
as
much
like
club
soda
or
tonic
water
as
it
is
beer
if
your
looking
for
lowcarb
or
lowalcohol
try
something
like
michelob
ultra
aspen
edge
or
even
old
milwaukee
na
after
reading
the
previous
reviews
on
this
beer
its
obvious
to
me
how
many
rookie
beer
drinkers
we
have
registered
here
this
beer
is
obviously
a
european
light
beer
unlike
most
of
the
fake
mass
produced
american
beers
with
light
on
the
label
and
45
alc
european
beers
are
also
light
on
alcohol
this
one
is
perfect
for
what
it
is
brewed
for
not
everyone
is
an
alky
that
drinks
to
get
drunk
i
love
this
beer
as
i
can
drink
several
and
enjoy
them
without
waking
up
dying
with
a
hangover
if
your
out
to
get
drunk
then
by
all
means
this
is
not
your
beer
if
your
looking
for
a
great
tasting
easy
to
drink
light
beer
that
wont
bloat
you
or
scramble
your
brain
then
this
is
the
beer
i
love
it
and
ive
drank
more
beers
in
more
countries
than
the
average
american
ive
also
drank
more
beer
than
some
small
countries
rather
than
read
some
punks
review
how
about
try
it
yourself
and
rate
it
honestly
for
what
it
is
and
not
what
you
want
it
to
be
word
overall
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
consumed
out
by
the
pool
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
with
its
low
abv
its
good
for
that
but
if
im
going
for
a
macro
ill
look
elsewhere
thats
the
best
i
can
do
here
someone
left
a
few
in
my
fridge
so
i
figured
id

took
a
long
time
to
finally
introduce
a
light
beer
and
this
product
but
nothing
egregious
if
anything
its
got
a
less
skunky
taste
than
a
regular
heiny
mouthfeel
is
still
weak

i
dont
understand
why
this
beer
exists
in

it
was
very
thin

i
would
not

was
as
drinkable
as
belowaverage
tap
water
watereddown
more
than
most
of
its
style
i
cant
see
the
point
of
drinking
this
presentation
packaged
in
a
tall
narrow
green
glass
bottle
which
is
taller
and
thinner
than
the
standard
heineken
bottle
perhaps
this
is
a
bit
of
visual
psychology
for
the
weightconscious
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
heineken
premium
light
lager
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
skunky
and
corn
dominated
very
light
flavor
corn
toward
the
end
nothing
to
particularly
recommend
this
over
any
other
light
swill
not
recommended
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
dont
even
try
this
sinkability

this
was
a
very
sinkable
beer
okay
here
we
go
a
brew
that
is
a
light
version
of
heine
is
that
possible
well
lets
just
say
im
not
sure
appears
a
light
golden
pale
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
leaves
behind
nice
scattered
lacing
aroma
has
more
skunky
euro
hops
sorry
folks
those
are
the
facts
on
this
beer
they
promote
a
nice
skuny
grassy
hop
character
with
a
minimal
citrus
profile
just
enjoy
and
now
your
enjoying
something
high
end
right
taste
has
lighter
crisp
version
of
heineken
i
could
see
this
going
over
here
with
crisp
hop
character
it
finishes
a
tad
bitter
for
american
flavor
but
its
actually
not
that
bad
grassy
citrus
hop
profile
with
light
creamy
biscuit
malt
tones
go
figure
mouthfeel
as
the
label
reveals
its
light
bodied
higher
artificial
carbonation
not
the
end
of
the
world
drinkability
well
not
that
bad
i
could
crave
this
in
another
life
possibly
but
once
again
pretty
unoffensive
what
can
i
say
taste
is
very
clean
very
crisp
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
almost
like
drinking
grain
flavored
water
virtually
no
lingering
after
taste
i
suppose
the
heineken
drinker
who
is
looking
for
something
light
would
like
this
this
bottle
was
left
at
my
house
and
i
cant
see
myself
ever
buying
it
as
i
like
fuller
flavored
beers
but
if
someone
is
looking
for
a
brew
that
is
clean
and
crisp
leaves
no
lingering
taste
on
the
palate
then
this
is
probably
it
avoid
beermail
me
for
the
punchline
if
you
have
never
heard
that
one
i
feel
this
beer
is
only
for
heineken
fans
overall
a
waste
of
10
bucks
a
buddy
of
mine
stopped
by
with
a
sixer
of
this
so
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
shot
not
much
smell
or
taste
to
it
very
bland
a
bit
corny
and
skunky
kinda
like
bad
city
water
in
some
places
ive
been
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
i
could
only
finish
one
and
wont
be
having
another
if
i
want
a
light
beer
ill
grab
a
sa
light
instead
i
enjoy
the
full
version
of
heineken
but
the
light
just
isnt
all
that
good
if
you
are
into
a
watered
down
beer
this
may
be
the
thing
for
you
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
lot
like
a
coors
light
they
have
some
really
good
commercials
on
tv
but
i
did
not
like
my
sample
that
i
tatsed
at
the
world
beer
festival
in
raleigh
nc
april
2006
if
you
like
heineken
stick
with
the
regular
and
skip
the
premium
light
doesnt
taste
like
heineken
fairly
bland
lager
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
richer
than
most
light
beers
i
have
tried
i
certainly
wouldnt
look
for
if
but
it
is
about
on
par
with
miller
lite
if
you
are
out
there
with
a
very
limited
selection
of
watery
bland
beers
appearance
is
less
than
average
the
ubiquitous
yellow
lager
color
small
head
that
fades
quickly
little
smell
almost
no
lacing
i
would
like
to
try
one
without
the
cryogenically
frosted
beer
mug
i
was
given
but
im
sure
the
flavor
would
not
be
that
much
better
in
a
nonfrosted
glass
ok
for
a
session
if
you
are
counting
calories
and
there
is
nothing
memorable
to
tempt
you
with
had
this
from
some
family
who
came
with
it
pours
increadibly
light
colored
and
a
small
fizzy
head
that
really
fades
quickly
not
really
too
carbonated
smell
has
that
floral
medicinal
quality
i
associate
with
regular
heineken
but
its
fainter
taste
is
also
similar
but
fainter
malt
is
really
lacking
and
there
is
no
sweetness
or
carbonation
to
give
this
beer
life
finish
has
a
slight
hoppiness
but
thats
about
it
unfortunate
that
some
people
buy
this
there
i
tried
it
no
thanks
on
the
rare
occasion
that
im
in
the
mood
for
a
light
beer
i
will
not
be
picking
up
anymore
of
this
there
are
far
better
light
beers
out
there
most
of
which
cost
less
too
pours
pale
straw
with
crystal
clarity
dense
foamy
head
of
two
and
a
half
fingers
shows
good
retention
and
leaves
nice
sticky
lacing
light
aroma
of
cereal
adjuncts
and
pale
malt
but
skunked
hops
dominate
the
taste
is
sweet
and
corny
with
a
pale
malt
flavor
trying
to
pull
through
a
pleasently
mild
euro
hop
flavor
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
but
this
overcompensation
for
a
lack
of
malt
flavor
puts
the
flavor
out
of
balance
smooth
light
body
with
even
carbonation
that
distinctive
skunk
taste
is
the
only
real
character
in
this
beer
so
the
drinkability
is
good
if
youre
fond
of
that
lightstruck
flavor
overall
a
marco
larger
aimed
at
the
college
crowd
who
think
the
green
bottle
is
cool
ill
pass
unless
it
is
free
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
albeit
to
a
lesser
degree
its
really
remarkable
what
they
heinekens
crack
team
of
brewers
have
done
here
when
you
think
about
it
they
spent
two
decades
extracting
every
last
taste
molecule
out
of
regular
heineken
i
wouldnt
have
thought
it
would
take
that
long
but
i
do
congratulate
them
on
the
thoroughness
of
their
acheivement
id
rather
drink
this
than
regular
heineken
or
any
other
light
beer
on
the
market
but
since
i
have
come
to
terms
with
my
beer
gut
i
will
stick
to
the
good
stuff
just
an
average
drinkable
beer
very
very
light
crisp
taste
however
you
can
taste
that
it
is
a
quality
made
light
beer
this
sint
a
bud
light
we
are
talking
about
here
deep
complex
taste
no
cheap
crap
no
again
would
reccomend
for
dieters
mainly
what
gives
what
will
it
take
for
a
major
brewer
to
come
up
with
a
light
lager
that
really
really
tastes
like
real
beer
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
lighter
in
color
than
regular
heineken
because
i
had
it
in
a
bottle
it
is
bland
with
a
very
watery
almost
club
soda
type
mouthfeel
i
would
call
this
a
nh
beer
for
nonhopped
there
would
be
no
suprise
to
find
out
that
they
removed
the
hop
flavor
from
this
beer
after
brewing
in
the
way
nonalcoholic
beers
are
made
yet
this
is
one
of
the
few
light
beers
that
tastes
very
close
to
its
nonlight
offering
a
true
swill
nonetheless
ss
ive
had
better
import
light
lagers
ive
had
worse
too
pours
out
to
a
medium
yellow
color
with
a
short
lived
head
of
foam
minor
notes
of
lace
aromas
of
light
malt
and
mild
hops
some
cereal
notes
taste
was
fair
some
sweet
malt
and
grain
touches
of
watery
hops
mouthfeel
is
mediocre
not
to
be
confused
with
thirstquenching
drinkability
is
fair
possibly
the
best
pick
at
a
boring
bar
but
nothing
special
cheers
well
theres
not
much
that
wasnt
expected
here
heineken
light
in
the
green
bottle
is
lightstruck
skunked
just
like
the
regular
version
it
pretty
much
tastes
like
regular
heineken
thats
been
watereddown
yet
it
still
retains
most
of
the
alcohol
gone
are
the
nice
malts
and
herbal
hops
it
is
however
very
refreshing
very
refreshing
kind
of
like
water
and
it
has
enough
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
that
it
tastes
much
more
like
beer
than
the
american
light
beers
there
are
better
light
beers
available
sam
adams
for
example
but
in
comparison
to
the
likes
of
bud
light
miller
lite
amstel
light
and
corona
light
id
take
this
one
among
light
beers
this
is
no
worse
than
average
and
perhaps
a
bit
better
but
then
this
is
a
low
standard
to
start
with
overall
the
flavor
profile
seemed
true
to
the
standard
heineken
lager
only
watereddown
i
suspect
you
could
achieve
the
same
effect
by
letting
a
couple
of
ice
cubes
melt
in
a
glass
of
heineken
neither
offensive
nor
enjoyable
just
wet
d
a
watery
beer
this
is
a
beer
for
people
that
really
dont
want
to
drink
beer
or
think
that
drinking
regular
beer
will
make
them
fat
its
not
all
of
the
fast
food
and
junk
food
that
made
them
fat
right
when
will
this
lowcarb
beer
fad
die
a
quick
death
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
modest
white
head
smell
is
so
minimal
as
to
be
virtually
nonexistent
taste
is
also
so
very
light
as
to
be
almost
nothing
mouth
fell
is
nothing
this
beer
is
almost
completely
tasteless
at
least
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
it
ehhh
not
recommended
that
being
said
this
just
makes
heineken
even
worse
i
just
despise
it
well
the
heineken
light
finished
well
with
the
baked
catfish
after
three
bottles
of
them
i
know
it
will
be
well
received
this
summer
by
the
thirsty
masses
in
the
hamptons
the
cape
and
mystic
as
the
marketing
effort
gets
going
overall
better
than
i
thought
but
not
good
but
as
a
financial
aspect
i
think
they
should
have
made
this
years
ago
as
im
sure
they
will
make
millions
but
as
for
the
beer
ill
pass
for
real
beer
this
isnt
good
but
for
a
light
beer
this
is
a
great
deal
better
than
anything
made
in
the
usa
it
wont
make
you
throw
out
your
pilsner
but
if
you
had
no
other
choice
except
light
beer
this
would
be
the
one
i
would
pick
i
cant
trash
this
it
is
far
better
than
bud
light
or
michelob
ultra
i
may
be
one
of
the
first
in
maine
to
try
heineken
light
as
i
was
told
that
it
isnt
supposed
to
be
released
retail
until
april
1
but
i
saw
a
case
on
the
beer
delivery
truck
and
talked
the
store
owner
into
getting
it
for
me
bad
idea
tastes
a
lot
like
becks
light
a
good
hoppiness
but
a
chemical
aftertaste
the
aroma
makes
one
think
that
they
used
artificial
hop
flavoring
artificial
side
note
the
women
i
was
with
absolutely
loved
this
so
it
will
probably
be
a
hit
money
wise
beer
wise
it
is
a
step
back
was
this
really
necessary
also
the
bottle
is
a
little
different
than
the
regular
heineken
its
not
as
squat
and
fat
but
a
little
more
slender
and
hipper
i
can
see
where
the
packaging
would
appeal
to
women
and
hipstertrendy
folk
im
sure
that
heineken
light
will
thrill
plenty
of
college
kids
and
im
sure
its
light
nature
allows
plenty
of
trips
to
the
fridge
but
if
youre
a
beer
drinker
beware
in
short
this
beer
doesnt
add
anything
to
the
light
macro
lager
field
it
had
the
same
slightly
metallic
chemical
taste
of
coors
lightit
tastes
more
like
coors
light
than
like
bud
light
or
miller
lite
which
provides
a
frame
of
reference
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
heineken
i
give
em
credit
for
spelling
out
light
rather
than
using
lite
so
drinking
this
beer
promotes
literacy
but
thats
about
it
classic
heineken
skunkiness
followed
by
a
watery
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
bland
aftertaste
woohoo
sure
am
glad
they
bothered
to
make
this
beer
thats
sarcasm
folks
maybe
this
would
be
a
halfway
decent
lawnmower
beer
if
it
wasnt
a
light
beer
and
had
some
oomph
behind
it
but
alas
another
bad
import
in
green
glass
this
has
just
a
hint
of
the
european
flavor
also
typical
flavorless
adjunct
lager
could
be
mistaken
for
any
light
flavorless
beer
great
on
a
hot
day
or
at
the
beach
not
much
else
watery
yellow
fizzy
beer
not
great
this
is
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
since
my
trip
to
puerto
rico
about
a
decade
ago
i
remember
drinking
little
10
oz
cans
on
the
beach
anyway
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hints
of
grains
taste
is
light
and
really
bland
some
corn
not
much
else
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
nothing
offensive
and
fine
on
a
hot
day
but
greatly
lacking
in
flavor
great
light
beer
to
drink
all
dayerry
day
in
rincon
i
am
fairly
certain
i
could
make
this
beer
all
i
need
is
water
and
some
light
syrup
there
really
is
nothing
there
but
i
love
it
i
am
usually
sitting
on
a
beach
in
puerto
rico
or
being
dragged
into
the
ocean
to
die
by
the
undertow
when
i
am
drinking
it
the
ocean
water
is
a
little
higher
quality
than
the
beer
but
it
is
perfect
this
beer
should
never
be
exported
from
the
island
craving
my
next
medalla
its
water
with
corn
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
nothing
to
it
one
can
easily
tear
through
18
of
these
and
binge
on
delicious
fried
foods
next
to
the
beach
not
saying
i
did
but
one
could
always
fun
to
try
lagers
from
around
the
world
light
absolutely
it
shouldnt
however
feel
like
soda
with
nothing
to
the
body
whatsoever
bight
straw
colored
with
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
inside
the
white
head
quickly
dissipates
almost
entirely
and
only
covers
about
half
of
the
top
of
the
beer
aroma
is
of
corn
and
sweaty
gym
socks
the
flavor
is
primarily
corn
with
a
hint
of
saaz
bittering
hops
with
a
somewhat
salty
aftertaste
mouth
is
thin
and
quaffable
a
hot
weather
beverage
it
is
what
it
is
cheap
and
drinkable
much
like
a
corona
in
mexico
this
light
lager
is
aokay
this
is
much
better
than
its
american
counterparts
actually
not
terrible
better
than
bud
or
coors
lite
by
miles
if
ice
cold
pairs
great
with
local
cuisine
like
mofongo
had
a
can
from
puerto
rico
thanks
josh
light
pale
adjunct
lager
drinkable
but
also
very
comparable
to
seltzer
in
taste
pretty
bland
and
also
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
i
could
drink
this
in
100
degree
heat
if
i
did
not
have
filtered
and
bottled
water
o
this
beer
is
light
with
almost
no
flavor
no
hops
or
malt
at
all
but
it
is
also
perfectly
clean
no
sulfur
or
offflavors
just
fizzy
water
flavor
is
quite
dry
with
a
short
almost
cottony
finish
offers
a
hint
of
grain
on
the
feel
but
is
otherwise
a
bit
astringent
overall
the
dry
nature
of
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
tasting
a
bit
like
a
light
version
of
an
ice
beer
but
alas
the
cruise
ship
awaits
this
is
the
signature
puertorican
beer
it
is
made
in
mayaguez
and
most
of
the
medalla
fans
are
obviously
in
that
area
college
students
love
it
because
it
is
cheap
the
color
is
golden
yellow
almost
no
head
when
poured
into
a
glass
it
smells
of
grains
pretty
unappealing
if
you
ask
me
the
taste
is
too
carbonated
and
leaves
the
hard
palate
with
a
dryuncomfortable
feeling
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
if
you
like
light
beers
dont
hesitate
to
give
it
a
try
rjt
to
be
fair
the
can
does
state
sabor
con
menos
calarias
y
carbohidratos
so
if
theres
no
calories
or
carbs
whats
left
drink
one
and
find
out
overall
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
probably
because
it
tastes
like
water
no
real
flavor
but
nothing
bad
tasting
either
thebeeralmanac
com
o
its
almost
water
so
on
this
humid
day
in
puerto
rico
ill
take
it
if
i
want
a
light
adjunct
lager
im
ordering
coors
light
because
it
tastes
the
most
like
water
and
honestly
id
much
rather
have
water
than
any
of
the
above
certainly
an
ok
light
lager
one
that
beats
most
of
the
big
boys
out
there
the
wee
10
fl
oz
can
made
me
wonder
what
caused
the
delay
but
the
crack
glug
went
off
without
a
hitch
i
initially
had
two
fingers
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
but
the
retention
was
not
there
and
it
faded
into
memory
pretty
quickly
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
lots
of
co2
bubbles
nose
smelled
of
cereal
adjuncts
and
my
ho
hum
meter
energized
itself
nothing
new
here
folks
just
keep
moving
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
lager
flavor
on
the
tongue
finish
was
semidry
and
definitely
refreshing
on
a
humid
afternoon
i
do
not
know
what
more
i
can
say
about
this
one
whoops
i
almost
missed
a
bet
by
not
noting
that
it
was
my
first
puerto
rican
beer
on
the
canquest
tm
o
this
is
slightly
better
then
bmcs
it
is
perhaps
a
great
beer
for
puerto
rico
and
its
hot
days
serves
cold
this
makes
a
nice
brew
for
the
island
but
dont
expect
much
that
being
said
i
have
enjoyed
drinking
it
countless
times
in
the
island
you
are
not
going
to
find
any
craft
choices
here
so
go
for
it
the
cpj
the
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
with
a
zippy
carbonation
i
have
used
the
word
light
several
times
here
and
it
is
a
good
description
but
not
an
insult
this
is
fine
beer
for
hot
weather
and
better
than
many
mass
market
light
lagers
for
a
light
lager
its
got
a
crisp
light
taste
its
inexpensive
good
at
a
variety
of
temperatures
and
needs
no
garnish
and
for
a
canned
beer
its
probably
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
ever
tasted
its
a
puertorrican
staple
and
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
caribbean
region
served
in
a
mug
with
lime
which
i
tossed
to
keep
the
original
flavor
of
the
beer
head
was
a
little
better
than
a
finger
of
foam
with
lace
that
was
broken
but
average
cling
color
was
a
dark
yellow
about
a
3
on
the
srm
beer
color
strip
smell
of
burnt
corn
boiled
oats
and
lemon
peel
taste
was
sharp
with
flavors
of
oatmeal
wheat
malt
citrus
and
pepper
mouthfeel
was
mildly
creamy
with
good
tingle
had
this
beer
while
i
was
vacationing
in
puerto
rico
not
looking
for
another
in
the
states
but
i
will
drink
it
locally
o
pretty
good
for
the
style
i
like
it
more
than
the
light
lagers
from
bmc
the
slight
sweetness
helps
out
typcial
light
lager
refreshing
when
cold
but
has
undesirable
flavors
when
warming
drank
easy
at
the
street
festival
the
beer
selection
is
pretty
thin
on
the
island
with
the
big
3
american
labels
and
heineken
getting
the
most
play
as
long
as
youre
visiting
why
not
drink
something
local
and
get
a
couple
of
respect
points
from
the
barkeep
and
waitstaff
for
supporting
their
hometown
player
very
drinkable
brew
for
a
light
beer
this
is
pretty
darn
good
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
could
get
it
taste
hmm
clean
and
inoffensive
and
inanything
then
again
so
is
water
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
seltzer
like
while
i
would
drink
this
lying
fatly
on
a
beach
in
puerto
rico
i
cant
really
think
of
another
time
or
place
id
want
one
rather
boring
to
be
honest
but
what
were
you
expecting
poured
a
golden
straw
color
perfectly
clear
complete
with
a
foamy
white
head
of
2
it
took
a
little
bit
to
dissipate
but
left
some
trails
of
lacing
and
retained
as
a
thin
ring
even
this
is
impressive
for
a
light
lager
hints
of
corn
sweetness
and
touch
of
metallic
twang
sweet
and
light
just
as
expected
it
is
not
offputting
by
any
means
in
fact
it
has
a
pleasant
sweet
and
lightly
bitter
taste
very
clean
finish
and
drinks
very
much
like
water
decently
carbonated
although
it
could
use
just
a
touch
more
crispness
otherwise
quite
drinkable
and
great
for
this
florida
weather
especially
after
a
long
run
as
i
just
did
thanks
again
bj
o
one
of
the
better
light
beers
ive
had
d
this
beer
is
everywhere
in
pr
it
almost
seems
to
be
a
constant
in
a
sometimes
disorderly
world
its
simple
refreshing
and
seems
to
always
be
the
perfect
beer
for
this
time
and
place
on
a
technical
note
appearance
is
a
dull
hazy
yellow
fairly
well
carbonated
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
essentially
nonexistant
taste
is
dull
no
crispness
just
carbonation
overall
yet
another
example
of
what
i
call
mexilager
or
in
this
case
but
otherwise
it
is
below

643334this
is
the
standard
local
beer
in
puerto
rico
it
comes
in
10
oz
cans
but
this
review
is
for
the
12
oz
bottles
bottle
says
its
a
little
over
3
carbos
per
bottle
this
is
not
all
that
bad
as
some
seem
shocked
shocked
by
what
is
a
pretty
standard
light
brew
flavors
are
clean
it
actually
has
a
touch
of
hops
and
the
sweetness
is
not
excessive
if
you
compared
this
to
bud
light
i
think
this
cerveza
would
win
easily
from
the
yes
actual
quart
bottle
that
will
always
remind
me
of
padre
beer
from
safeway
this
one
came
from
ralphs
in
san
diego
for
less
than
two
bucks
overall
somewhere
between
totally
forgettable
to
regrettable
i
just
cant
decide
someone
below
stated
it
was
typical
of
the
style
and
maybe
they
had
a
better
batch
but
this
is
in
now
way
shape
or
form
in
the
league
of
modelo
especial
or
even
dos
equis
lager
i
have
had
some
bad
beers
but
this
one
is
the
definition
of
swill
it
tasted
of
rotten
corn
and
moldy
malt
it
was
thin
and
pale
in
color
overall
4
was
a
ripoff
overall
its
an
okay
beer
cheap
and
drinkable
very
strong
grassy
note
not
really
an
impressive
beer
this
one
is
forgettable
this
is
your
typical
mexican
style
lager
the
flavor
is
so
light
that
it
borders
on
nonexistent
its
refreshing
but
besides
that
this
is
completely
forgettable
ill
pass
in
the
future
thank
you
always
make
it
a
great
day
overall
grab
this
if
you
want
something
cheap
forget
the
domestic
cheap
stuff
cuz
caguama
destroys
them
i
may
have
just
had
a
skunked
version
of
this
beer
but
i
am
not
even
close
to
half
and
it
is
barely
sippable
this
is
just
an
ok
beer
over
all
glad
i
only
bought
the
single
bottle
i
could
drink
it
but
wont
be
buying
it
again
i
was
anxious
to
greet
el
caguama
and
went
to
a
quick
crack
followed
by
an
inverted
glug
resulting
in
a
finger
of
fizzy
bonewhite
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
in
evidence
a
greg
koch
special
and
if
that
marks
me
as
a
sissy
not
much
to
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
light
almost
salty
aftertaste
im
not
a
picky
beer
drinker
by
any
means
and
i
can
barely

this

o
this
beer
has
a
very
light
flavor
and
is
a
very
clean
lager
there
is
not
much
pils
malt
flavor
compared
to
other
competing
flavors
it
is
a
easy
drinker
but
a
full
bodied
beer
was
a
gift
from
a
employee
of
mine
shorts
mix
pack
worst
one
but
not
that
bad
i
enjoy
a
lager
after
a
long
day
o
if
they
were
trying
for
a
crappy
adjunct
lager
they
nailed
it
it
represents
the
style
well
i
just
do
not
care
for
the
style
a
simple
beer
that
can
be
appreciated
by
craft
and
bmc
drinkers
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
sometimes
im
in
the
mood
for
something
thats
not
an
inyourface
ipa
or
stout
and
this
is
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
malty
flavor
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
dont
be
fooled
by
light
in
the
name
it
is
a
fullbodied
beer
overall
fun
alternative
to
the
big
lagers
but
nothing
special
o
this
beer
seemed
to
be
fuller
in
body
compared
to
the
light
lagers
made
by
macro
breweries
but
didnt
have
any
offensive
flavors
in
the
taste
or
aftertaste
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
the
sense
that
you
could
pound
a
six
pack
without
any
problems
if
you
are
at
a
tailgate
and
are
wanting
to
drink
several
beers
throughout
the
day
this
would
be
an
excellent
craft
alternative
to
bl
ml
and
other
domestic
lagers
not
a
beer
that
i
would
pick
up
when
looking
for
a
unique
sensory
experience
overall
great
option
when
you
dont
want
something
too
filling
but
light
and
refreshinggreat
with
a
good
burger
tried
this
as
my
first
drink
on
my
21st
birthdaynot
a
ton
of
flavor
though
the
body
is
light
but
with
some
depth
and
feel
to
it
its
crisp
and
its
fairly
smooth
considering
its
clean
for
the
most
part
but
with
a
slight
slickness
coming
into
the
end
o
the
flavor
got
me
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
good
beer
for
active
summer
activities
a
unique
take
on
a
light
lager
o
if
the
goal
was
to
make
an
alternative
to
the
bud
lights
of
the
world
id
prefer
more
of
a
attempt
at
flavor
o
given
the
style
its
pretty
solid
id
choose
it
over
the
usual
suspects
given
a
decent
pricing
point
probably
a
great
lawn
mower
beer
that
said
im
not
going
to
seek
it
out
having
seen
it
on
tap
lists
before
id
be
confident
in
ordering
it
when
i
really
want
something
on
the
lighter
side
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
with
a
halfinch
of
white
head
the
aroma
offers
corn
grain
adjuncts
the
flavor
follows
suit
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
solid
beer
nothing
offensive
per
se
but
also
not
something

with

and
very

to
drink
a
pleasantly
enjoyable
offering
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
very
good
example
of
the
style
it
was
very
true
to
style
and
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
so
far
i
would
say
theres
hasnt
been
a
light
lager
that
i
enjoy
drinking
more
than
this
one
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
clean
not
filling
but
the
flavors
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
this
style
never
does
and
as
a
session
and
all
day
drinking
beer
goes
this
is
a
good
example
of
it
and
i
think
drinking
a
six
pack
through
out
the
day
wouldnt
be
a
problem
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
how
true
to
style
it
was
shorts
didnt
do
anything
crazy
with
this
one
its
just
a
quality
light
lager
the
way
it
should
be
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
i
thought
it
was
a
little
hazy
for
the
style
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
if
i
had
a
choice
between
this
and
all
the
other
popular
light
lagers
i
would
take
this
one
for
sure
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
and
it
might
make
for
a
good
brew
to
ease
someone
into
to
the
shorts
lineup
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
i
love
good
craft
beer
as
much
as
the
next
person
but
theres
always
a
time
and
a
place
for
a
light
lager
and
if
im
going
to
drink
one
i
would
prefer
a
quality
one
and
thats
exactly
what
this
beer
is
good
job
shorts
overall
this
beer
isnt
super
tastey
but
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
pleasant
for
a
light
lager
easily
the
best
light
lager
i
have
had
but
i
cant
give
it
perfect
ratings
just
because
there
is
certainly
room
for
improvement
although
i
dont
know
where
in
a
light
lager
